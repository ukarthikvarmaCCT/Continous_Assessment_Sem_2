 leki ab is vishay par zyada dhyaan nahin diya gaya ki smartphone se nikalne vaale radiation sperm ko bhi nuksaan pahunchaate hai
 At the moment there is no consensus on whether smartphones cause cancer or not
 dablyuechao kaa kahana he ki koi nirnaayak pramaan bhi nahin he or america or europea regulators kii bhi yahi raay he
 However, researchers believe that the radiation emanating from the phone is harmful for sperm and may be the cause of infertility
 sperm count par cell phone radiation ke prabhaavon ko nirdhaarit karne ke liye kai research kiye gaye hai
 The 2014 risers in the Central European Journal of Urology found that men who kept their phones in their front pockets for a long time had fewer sperm counts and higher numbers of sperm cells with DNA fragmentation
 shodh ke nishkarsh ke anusaar, 'aise purush jo pita banane ke liye khud ko taiyaar kar rahe hai, khaskar jab unhen fertility kii samasya maujuud ho, to behatar hoga ki trouger kii jeb main mobile phone ko lambey samay tak rakhane se bachein
 Another research conducted in 2015 by the International Journal of Fertility and Sterility has also given similar results for sperm that were in contact with radiation for one hour
 Vox
 a report by com says that in terms of fertility, phone radiation has more impact on men than women
 aisa sperm or overi kii lokation kii vajah se hota he
 Ovaries are very much present inside the body of women where the effect of radiation is not easily reached
 duusari taraf purushon kii body main sperm cells testis main maujuud hote hai jo body ke baahar hota he
 In such a situation, the effect of radiation is more rapid in men than women
 ab tak purushon kii fertility par phone se hon prabhaavon ko aupchaarik rup se sabit nahin kiya gaya he, lekin saar ye he ki phone radiation nikaalte hai jo sperm ke liye acha nahin he

 bahujan samaaj party kii adhyaksh mayawati ne uttar pradesh main congress ko alag rakhkar samaajawaadee party ke saath gathbandhan kaa faisla kiya
 After this, the BSP chief has now questioned the farmers' debt waiver of the Congress on the occasion of his birthday
 jabaki congress isi karjamaafee ko lekar 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main apni siyaasi bisaat bichaane main juty he or narendra modi ko maat dekar satta main vaapasi karnaa chaahati he
 In such a situation, by attacking the trump card of the Congress, he has exercised his political agenda streak
 kisaanon ke sahare siyaasi jameen talash rahe congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ke liye karjamaafee trump card mana ja rahaa he
 Recently, the promise of debt waiver in three states paved the way for the Congress to return to power in three states
 madhya pradesh, chhattisgarh or rajasthan main bani congress sarkaar ne karjamaafee ke vaade ko sarkaar banane ke fouran baad amalijama pahanaaya
 The Congress is considering it as a major success
 kisaanon kii karjamaafee kii jis raah par congress chali he, us par use bada siyaasi phayda 2019 ke najar aa rahe he
 In such a situation, BSP President Mayawati tried to squeeze air into the balloon of Congress' debt waiver
 mayawati ne kaha ki congress ne kisaanon karjamaafee ke naam par dhokhaa diya he
 The BSP president said that the Congress formed government in three states - Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan, where they have cheated in the name of loan waiver of the farmers
 kisaanon kii purna karjamaafee kii jaani chahie
 The BSP supremo said that they are not going to get relief by waiving a little debt of the farmers who take loans
 karjadaar kisaanon kii mushkilen agar khatm nahin huin to unki aatmahatyaayein band nahin ho paaengi
 Mayawati said that instead of waiving the loan waiver of the farmers, a concrete policy should be made and the Swaminathan report should be implemented for income for the farmers
 mayawati ne kaha ki congress ne desh main sabase zyada samay tak raaj kiya he
 Due to the policies of Congress, many political parties were formed in the country
 1984 main basapa ke baad kai raajnneetik dal bane, lekin unki soch congress se alag nahin
 In this case, teach Congress and Company a lesson in elections
 dilachasp baat ye he mayawati congress or uski nitiyon ke khilaaf sakht tevar akhriyaar kiye hue hai
 But Congress President Rahul Gandhi seems soft about the BSP supremo
 sapa-basapa gathbandhan main congress ko na shaamil kiye jane par rahul ne kaha tha ki ham donon (mayawati or akhilesh) kaa sammaan karte hai
 They have full right to take decisions as they wish
 ham nishchit taur par uttar pradesh main ladenge or logon ko chaunkaayenge
 The Congress party will contest on its ideology
 mayawati ne isse pehle madhya pradesh, chhattisgarh or rajasthan main bhi congress ke saath koi gathbandhan nahin kiya tha
 Whereas the Congress wanted to contest elections with the BSP in all three states
 mayawati ne chunaav prachaar ke dauraan congress par isi tarah se jamkar hamalaa kiya tha, lekin nattejey aane ke baad teenon rajyon main congress ko samarthan dekar sarkaar banavaane main ahm bhoomika adaa kii thi

 chhattisgarh main ab sarkari karmchaariyon or afasaron ko do se zyada bachche paidaa karne kii chhot mil gai he
 Earlier, workers who produced more than two children were not entitled to many government facilities and salary allowances
 chhattisgarh civil seva (aacharan) niyam 1965 ke niyam 22 ke up niyam 4 main praavdhaan tha ki shaskeey sevak parivaar kalyaan se sambandhit nitiyon kaa paalan karegaa
 On the other hand, the Congress has opposed this decision of the government
 faisle kaa congress ne kiya virodh'ham do, hamaare do' vaala dashakon se chalaa aa rahaa parivaar niyojan kaa yah naaraa ab chhattisgarh main lagu nahin hoga
 There is good news in Chhattisgarh for government officials and employees who want to have two or more children
 unhen ab iske liye bilkul bhi sochna nahin hoga kyonki sarkaar ne khud isaki ijaajat de di he
 The Raman government of the state has decided to delete the provision which is considered to be a misconduct for the birth of two or more children of government servants in the cabinet meeting
 isse sarkari karmchaaree or adhikari do se adhik bachche paidaa kar sakenge
 This decision will apply to government employees of all religions and castes
 haalanki rajya ke mukhya vipakshi dalcongresane bijepi sarkaar ke is faisle kaa virodh kiya he
 The party argues that when there is scarcity of food grains in the country and the government has no control over inflation, at such a time, the decision to prove family planning is meaningless
 chhattisgarh main kareeb 17 lakh sarkari karmchaaree hainchhattisgarh menyah pehla mauka he, jab rajya kii bijepi sarkaar ne sarkari kamchaariyon ke liye li se hat kar koi faisla kiya he
 Earlier, the state government used to take decisions regarding transfer and salary allowances of government personnel
 chhattisgarh main sarkari karmchaariyon kii sankhya 17 lakh ke kareeb he
 Government employees are surprised that according to a survey, the number of employees between the ages of 25 and 35 in government meetings in the state is around 38 per cent, while 85 per cent of the people aged 40 to 50 and employees and officers between the ages of 50 and 60 are The number is only 17 percent
 sarkaar ke is faisle se kinhen phayda hoga yah to sarkaar jane, lekin parivaar niyojan ke maamle main di gai chhot se khud sarkari karmchaaree or adhikari hairat main hai
 On the other hand, the government has its own logic in the matter of declaring family planning
 ye he sarkaar kaa tarkrajya ke krishi mantri brijmohan agarwal ke mutabik har kisi sarkari karmi kaa yah maanavdhikaar he ki ve jitne chahen utane bachche paidaa kar saken
 The government should have no control over it
 unke mutabik jab gaiyr sarkari logon par bachche paidaa karne kaa koi niyam nahin lagu kiya gaya he, to sarkari karmiyon ke liye bhi koi niyam nahin hona chahie
 It should not be associated with any religion or caste
 aabaadi niyantrit karne ke liye bana tha niyam'ham do, hamaare do' parivaar niyojan kaa ye naaraa desh bhar main prachlit he
 This was reached to the common people so that the population of the country remained controlled and the standard of living of the common man improved
 parivaar niyojan kaa yah niyam un karmchaariyon par lagu kiya gaya tha, jinke bacchon kaa janm 26 janvari 2001 yaa uske baad hua ho
 Sub-rule 4 of Rule 22 of Chhattisgarh Civil Services Conduct Rules 1965 provides that every government servant will follow the policies related to family welfare of the Government of India or the State Government, but now this rule will not be effective in Chhattisgarh

 siem ne kaha ki aisa karke bijepi vaale kahenge ki aam aadmi party kaa hi kaaryakarta tha or kejariwal se naaraaz tha
 The Delhi CM raised some questions and asked whether on the basis of this logic, if any of your AAP workers is angry with Kejriwal, he can kill him? If a Congress worker is angry with Captain Saab, he can kill? If a BJP worker is angry with Modi ji, he can kill
 kejariwal ne aage kaha, "ek din murder kar denge

 For Mexico, Hirving Lozano scored in the 35th minute of the match, penetrating the sluggish German defense which proved decisive

 yahaan par 222 siton par hue chunaav main bijepi ke haath 104 siten lageen or bies yediurppa ne siem pad kii shapath bhi lee
 However, he had to resign after 55 hours
 rajya kii raajnneeti main itani uthapatak dekhne ko mili ki siem yediurppa ko bahumat pareekshan se pehle hi istipha dena padaa
 Leaders of Congress (78 seats) and JDS (37 seats) put the Governor's role in the matter under question and went up to the Supreme Court
 yediurppa aakhri palon tak sarkaar bachaane kaa daawa karte rahe, lekin puure chunaavon ke dauraan agrani bhoomika nibhaane vaale amit shah is maamle main saamne nahin aae
 This was Amit Shah's second strategic defeat in recent times
 amit shah kii donon ranneetik haar main resort politics kaa ahm role rahaa
 Incidentally, the Eagleton resort of Karnataka remained in the background on both occasions
 yah resort isse pehle bhi rashtriya surkhiyon main rahaa tha
 In both the defeats of Amit Shah, this resort has a Rajya Sabha election for three seats in Gujarat last year
 bijepi adhyaksh amit shah gujarat kii teen rajyasabha siton ke chunaav main kabhi congress ke duusare sabase taqatvar shaks rahe ahamed patel ko maat dena chaahate the, lekin usamen safal nahin ho sake
 The demise of these two leaders has started from the politics of Gujarat and reached the national plank
 mjedaar baat yah he ki amit shah ko tab bhi or ab bhi haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Both times Amit Shah's defeat and Congress victory also mentioned Karnataka's Eagleton Resort
 gujarat rajya sabha chunaavon ke dauraan congress ke 44 vidhayak isi resort main ruke the
 He was brought to Gujarat a day before voting and Ahmed Patel reached the Rajya Sabha
 is baar bhi karnataka ke congressi vidhayak eagleton resort main hi ruke or aakhirkaar yediurppa ko istipha dena padaa
 The Congress Government has imposed crores of rupees
 Often the Congress Government has imposed heavy fines on this resort which is useful for the Congress
 pichhali baar gujarat ke vidhayakon ke yahaan rukne se thik pehle rajya kii congress sarkaar ne 77 acre jameen ke atikaraman kaa aarope lagaakar is resort par kareeb 1000 karod rupee kaa jurmaana lagaaya tha
 This step was taken by the Congress government's cabinet on the instructions of the Supreme Court
 bijepi ne hi di thi jameen2012 main bijepi kii rajya sarkaar is resort se 82
 It was in favor of giving it 77 acres of land for a fee of Rs 6 crore
 haalanki, baad main congress sarkaar ne is faisle ko palat diya tha
 Let us know that the rent for a day of one room of this resort is from 8 thousand rupees to 10 thousand rupees
 tikat bantwaare main amit shah kaa hayemit shah ne karnataka chunaavon se pehle hi yahaan par deraa jamaa liya tha
 During this, apart from organizing party workers, he also stopped factionalism
 amit shah ne yediurppa ke saath milakar tikat bantwaare par bhi ahm faisle liye
 Whether the decision to give tickets to the Reddy brothers and their relatives or to cut the ticket of Yeddyurappa's son Vijayendra, the party continued to rely on Amit Shah's strategy throughout the elections
 shah kaa muqabla tha rahul sebijapi ke amit shah kii tarah karnataka kii raajnneetik ladaai main congress ke bhi adhyaksh rahul gandhi hi maidan main the
 However, during the ticket distribution in the Congress camp, former CM Siddaramaiah was more than Rahul Gandhi
 apane bete yatindra ko apni seat varuna se utaarne se lekar do siton se chunaav ladane yaa phir yuvaaon ko tikat dene kaa maamla ho, sabase siddharmaiya kii ahm bhoomika rahi
 In this task, Shah took a beating with Rahul
 piem modi bhi nahin laga sake naiya parkarnataka main chunaav prachaar ke dauraan bhi jabatak piem narendra modi maidan main nahin utre the, congressi khemaa badhat banaata najar aa rahaa tha
 The then CM Siddaramaiah was single-handedly targeting PM Narendra Modi and Siddaramaiah on social media and their rallies
 modi ke prachaar main utarane ke baad unhone mukaable ko modi banaam rahul kaa bana liya tha or iske baad chunaav main rajya ke nahin rashtriya str ke mudde saamne aa gaye the
 Despite this, the BJP failed to get a majority
 plan bi nahin bana sake shahakarnataka kii 222 siton par hue chunaav main matganana ke dauraan ek baar bijepi akeli bahumat laati dikh rahi thi or party netaaon ne ek-duusare ko badhai deni bhi shuru kar di thi
 However, the BJP stayed eight seats behind the majority figure and this is where Amit Shah could not formulate Plan B
 sonia ke bharosemandon ne jiti rahul kii jangkarnataka se pehle goa main rajyasabha saansad ke chunaav ke dauraan bhi amit shah kii ranneeti ko asafalataa haath lagi thi
 At that time, Ahmed Patel was made close to Sonia Gandhi, the Congress leader
 rahul ke bijepi adhyaksh banane ke baad ahamed patel parshv main chale gaye the, lekin gujarat main party ke liye rajyasabha seat jeetne ke dauraan vah party ke sankatmochak bane
 Ghulam Nabi Azad did the same thing in Karnataka to another close son of Sonia and Rahul's mentor
 unhone karnataka main floor test se pehle tak congressi vidhayakon ko tuutane se bachaae rakhaa
 The government today warned Jan Dhan account holders, housewives and artisans not to allow their accounts to be used to deposit undisclosed funds

 The Finance Ministry has given this information in a statement and has asked the account holders to be vigilant

 The government had earlier said that 2 in bank accounts

 It was not easy to bat, after Pichido 'big Hitter' returned to the pavilion, Williamson (eight runs off 16 balls) was responsible for the innings but Raina stumped him

 punjab neshnal bank ghotaale ko lekar desh main mache hangaame ke bich pehali baar bhartiya rigerv bank ke governor urjit patel ne is par apni pratikriya di he
 Patel has said that we are also saddened by the news of scams unfolding in the banking sector
 banking sector ke in ghotaalon ko dekhte hue hamen bhi gussa aata he
 He said that to save the banking sector, we are also ready to drink poison by becoming Nilkanth
 darasal pichley kai dinon se pienbi frod ko lekararabiaiki aalochana ho rahi thi
 In this, questions were being raised about not taking some tough steps from the RBI
 is par arabiai governor ne kaha ki arabiai is tarah kii ghatnaon ko rokane ke liye har jagah par maujuud nahin rah saktaa he
 He said that there are many businessmen, who are engaged in robbing the country with the connivance of bank officials
 isse desh kaa nuksaan ho rahaa he
 RBI Governor said that we (RBI) will always be ready to take the banking sector out of this situation
 unhone kaha ki agar hamen 'nilkanth' banakar sector ko bachaane ke liye jehar bhi pinaa padegaa, to ham iske liye taiyaar rahenge
 We will continue to do our duty
 bataa den ki 12400 karod rupee kaa pienbi ghetaala saamne aane ke baad bhartiya rigerv bank lagaataar karrwai kar rahaa he
 Even before Urjit Patel's statement, the Reserve Bank of India has taken a big action
 arabiai ne bainkon ko letters of intent jari karne kii suvidha ko khatm kar diya he
 Along with this, the Central Bank has also abolished the Letter of Comfort (loc)
 in donon instrument kaa istemaal bank apane graahakon ko guarantee dete the
 The biggest impact will be on traders who import diamond and jewelery in a big way
 kendriya bank kii taraf se yah karrwai punjab neshnal bank ghotaale ke baad kii gai he
 Through this decision, RBI is trying to remove the loopholes in the banking system
 lou or locki vyavastha khatm kiye jane ke baad kaarobaariyon ko bank letters of credit or guarantee dete rah sakate hai
 This system will continue to run smoothly
 yah vyavastha antarrashtriya maanakon ke mutabik he
 This arrangement strengthens the credit issuer
 darasal jab bhi ek bank kisi kaarobaari ko paise dene ke liye guarantee or locs jari karte hai, to is vyavastha ke tahat risiving bank bhi apane str par jaanch karata he
 In this system, the bank that receives the guarantee sees at its level how strong and weak the credit history of the person it is going to pay
 isse loc jari karne vaale bank kii jimmedaari kaaphi kam ho jaati he
 At the same time, speaking of lou and letter of comfort, the banks lending in it give money only on the basis of the guarantee of the issuing bank
 isamen vah apane str par kisi bhi tarah kii jaanch nahin karte hai
 Because in lou, the bank issuing it in a way guarantees that it will make the payment if the customer defaults
 bankeron kaa kahana he ki letters of credit zyada surakshit hota he
 Because it also contains information of the importer, date of issue, expiry date and the goods for which it is being taken to buy
 lekin lou ke maamle main aisa nahin hota he
 Because of this, it becomes very difficult to detect disturbances in them
 lou kya he?letters of anderteking (lou) ek tarah se bank guarantee hoti he
 It is issued to make overseas payments for imports
 lou jari karne vaala bank guaranter ban jaataa he or vah apane client ke lone par principal amount or us par lagane vaale byaaj ko beshart bhugtan karnaa sweekaar karata he
 When lou is issued, it includes the issuing bank, the accepting bank, the importer and the company benefiting from it abroad
 pienbi ke maamle main farji lou hasil kiye gaye or inhen ke aadhaar par exis or elahabaad jaise bainkon kii videshi shakhaon se lone liye gaye the

 # metoo campaign After becoming viral on social media, many Bollywood and TV celebs have started referring to the horrific incident that happened to themselves
 ab serial 'ishkbaaj' kii actress shrenu paarikh ne bachapan main hue chhedchhad ke maamle kaa khulaasa kiya he
 The actress shared a post on the Insta account that at the age of 6, she was molested by a man inside a local bus
 # metoo: mahilaon ke yon utpeedan kii khaufnak kahaniyanunhone likhaa, ''bachapan main naanaa-nani ke paas main apni chhuttiyaan bitaane jaati thi
 Then we used to travel by local bus
 naanaa ke saath ek baar bas main ja rahi thi
 When the seats were full, Nana started asking for seats for me
 tabhi ek aadmi ne khud se kaha ki wo mujhe apni god main bitha legaa
 After which he started touching me in the wrong places
 ''as a kid i used to spend my vacations at my grandparents’ town! Those days we travelled in a local bus! And when the seats used to be occupied my grandfather used to request someone to share the seat for me! Similarly one uncle offered to nanu that “il make her sit on my lap” He willingly agreed thought atleast i won’t get tired, he made me sit on his lap! Me as a child couldn’t know what’s gonna happen to me i dozed off, only woke up to the feeling of being inappropriately being touched by that uncle! i could sense somethings wrong but i went all numb and thought it’s ok for him to hold me like that! i could see my naanu standing a little away from me but couldn’t tell him anything not then not later! i wish i would have spoken about it, i wish that man would’ve gotten his share of punishment for molesting a 6 year old! Not once but so many such incidents have happened , I’ve known from my friends but we never talk about it! Never raise our voices cz we r scared of how the society will eventually not believe us and we don’t stand for ourselves! What’s happening with Gauri is something I’m sure we all have faced on some or the other level in our lives! And that’s why m so glad we did this track so that women can come out and speak
 If we don't own our truth nobody else will
 This is just a small attempt to create a space for all of us to share our stories and raise our voices! # ishqbaaaz # metooa post shared byshrenu Parikh(@shrenuparikhofficial) onmay 29, 2018 at 12:12pm pdtve aage likhti hai, ''mujhe kuch samaj nahin aayaa main blank ho gai
 My Nanu was standing far away from me
 main unhen tab kuch nahin bataa pai naa hi uske baad
 i wish i could have spoken that man would have been punished for teasing a 6-year-old girl
 ''kans main mallika ne khud ko pinjre main kiya band, ye tha makasad''aisi ek nahin bahut sari ghatnaayen hoti hai
 We do not raise our voice because we fear society
 ham sabhi ne kabhi naa kabhi aisi vaardaaton ko saha he
 i am glad that women are now breaking their silence on such matters and raising their voice
 ye ek choti si pahal he ki aap sab bhi apni story share karen or aawaaj uthaaen

 rail mantri piyush goyal ne buudhvaar ko ek baar phir se banpar vaikency kii baat kahi jiske tahat do lakh 32 hazaar berozegaron kii bhartee kaa elaan kiya gaya
 Hearing the news, you must have felt how much the government is taking care of the unemployed
 lekin ab chaunkaane vaali baat ye saamne ai he ki pichley saal kii bhartee pariksha se railway ko inhen berozegaron se kareeb sava chaar sau karod kii kamai bhi hui he
 In February last year, when the railways removed the recruitment of about 1
25 lakh posts, about 2 crore 37 lakh applications were received
 kaabiliyat ke dam par tamaam chunautiyon kaa saamana karte or apane liye sambhaavna talashte ye chaatr dur daraaj ke ilaakon se apane apane centre pahunche
 Now in response to the RTI it was found that in the name of exam fees from these unemployed, the railways took not one or two but also about 900 crore rupees
 bhopal ke artiai kaaryakarta dow
 Prakash Aggarwal says that after much effort, the railway gave the figure
 isamen railway ne mana ki pariksha fees ke naam par 1 lakh 27 hazaar candidats se uske khate main kareeb 900 karod rupaya aayaa
 Together said that the money is also to be returned to the candidates who are present
 railway board ke sachiv ne kii mantri ke oesady ko hataane kii maang, khud kaa hi ho gaya tabadalaadansal, railway ne pariksha fees main do tarah kaa praavdhaan rakhaa tha
 General and Reserve categories
 saamaanya shrenee waalon ko 500 rupee dene the jisamen se pariksha main upasthit hone waalon ko 400 rupee waapas ho jaaenge
 250 rupees for reserved category students, and on appearing in the examination, the Railways laid a condition to send the entire money to their account
 or jo pariksha main upasthit nahin honge unke puure paise railway kii tijori main chale jaaenge
 CAG report: Railway workers are robbing contract workers
 Former Railway Board member Subodh Jain argues that the intention behind exam fees is that the expenses incurred in the exam can be recovered and non-serious students should not apply because no If applied unnecessarily, then the railway has to spend in its arrangement
 pariksha fees lautaane ke baad bhi 887 karod main se railway kii tijori main kareeb 427 karod rupee bache
 2 crore 37 lakh students applied
 isamen saamaanya or riserved category ke kul 83 lakh 88 hajaar chaatr pariksha dene aae hi nahin
 So all his money went to the railway account
 railway sutron ke anusaar pariksha nahin dene pahunche chaatro main kareeb 50,32,800, yani ki 60 fisadi saamaanya shrenee ke the jinamein har kisi se 500 rupee railway ne liye
 So the Railways earned Rs 251 crore 64 lakh from the general category students
 vahiin anupasthit rahe kareeb 33,55,200 chaatr riserved category ke the
 Of these, the Railways charged 250 rupees per student
 to inase railway ke khate main 83 karod 88 lakh rupee aae
 Therefore, after filling the form, Rs 335 crore 52 lakh came from the students who did not appear for the examination
 vahiin railway ke mutabik pariksha main upasthit hue kul chaatro kii sankhya 1 karod 53 lakh rahi
 Now if even 60% of its students are considered in the general category, out of which Rs 400 out of 500 rupees was to go to the railway account after 100 rupees, then the number of such students would be 91 lakh 80 thousand
 or 100 rupee ke hisaab se in chaatro se kamai 91 karod 80 lakh hoti he
 If all these figures are added and subtracted, then the total earning from the general category absent and appearing in the examination is Rs 427 crore 32 lakh
 sava lakh vaikensi main lakhon chaatro kaa centre dur daraaj ke ilaake main bhi tha
 So while they had a lot of inconvenience in reaching the center, the railway's revenue from the unemployed is currently 427 crores, if the railway minister's Wednesday's restoration of 2 lakh 32 thousand new vacancies, then the railway earns even more than the unemployed
 Will do it in the name of their recruitment

 in) onnov 25, 2019 at 11:42pm PST a top official of the World Health Organization has indicated that the 'H1N1' bacterium can engulf 20-40% of the world's population or more than one billion people in a year or two
 european centre for dijis privansion and control ke mutabik, khabaron main aae swine flu ke pusht maamle kal tak 175,785 the jisamen 1,116 maut ke maamle bhi shaamil hai
 WHO acting assistant director general Kizi Fukuda said in an interview that it is impossible to give an accurate figure, but looking at the epidemics of the past shows that at least one-third of the population in a year may be vulnerable to bacteria and Whether the rate is 20 percent or 40 percent, it does not matter
 phukuda ne kaha ki vibhinn deshon main antim sankraman str main shaayad fark ho saktaa he
 But i believe that in reality, 20, 30 or 40 percent is not much different
 ye to bas unchi fisadi he jo ye bataate hai ki mahamari ke halaat main aap zyada logon ke sankraman kii chapet main aane kii ashanka kar sakate hai

 ye khabar to yakican chaunkaane vaali he
 The Osama whom America had been looking for for the last ten years, whether he met alive or dead
 wo osama america ko mila bhi or maaraa bhi gaya
 But the question is, did anyone cheat him in Osama's house? How did the American jawans reach Osama about whom neighbors were not even aware? There are deep gestures hidden in these questions about Operation Osama
 unheen ishaaron kii buniyaad par ek nai khabar taiyaar hui he ki buudhe laden kii noujvaan bivi ne hi osama ko marava diya
 It was Amal who gave America a clue of Abbottabad
 yaman mul kii 28 saal kii amal, osama kii sabase choti bivi he
 How Amal met Osama? In a London newspaper, The Sunday Times, there was a news that behind the death of Osama, there was no informer of his wife Amal
 videshi media main chal rahi in khabaron se khud pakistan ke grahamantri rahamaan malik bhi ittefaq rakhte hai
 Malik surely says that the Navy Seals even knew in which room Osama was present in his Killenuma mansion
 pakistan ke grih mantri rahamaan malik kaa kahana he ki kai saalon tak khufia adhikari ke taur par jo meraa tajurba he, uske mutabik mujhe lagata he ki bheetar ke hi kisi shaks ne america ko sara bhed bataaya tha
 If they did not have accurate information, American commandos would not have reached Osama's room directly
 osama kii saudi mul qi do biviyaan pehle se kah rahi hai ki amal ne hi osama ke saath dawa kiya
 
 
 Either he provided all the information to America, or he gave the chance that America followed him to reach Osama's hideout
 haalanki pehle is bare main alag-alag theory saamne aa chuki he
 According to wikileaks, the clue of Abbottabad was found through two brothers working as couriers
 baad main ye bhi kaha gaya ki america ne hitech drone ke sahare abtabad main osama kii haveli ke chappe-chappe kaa pataa laga liya tha
 
 
 But now Biwi's betrayal theory has gained momentum
 agar osama kii sabase choti bivi amal par ye shaq jataayaa ja rahaa he ki kahin usne hi to osama kaa kaam tamaam karne main america kaa saath to nahin diya tha
 Why would Amal have done this? Osama had been living in his bungalow in Abbottabad for five years
 wo itane gupachup tareeke se rahata tha ki padosiyon ko bhi isaki bhanak tak nahin thi
 Now, if Osama's two wives are doubting the implementation and the Pakistani government sees the imprint of truth in it, then there are some reasons behind it
 sidhe osama ke kamare main hi kaise pahunche sil commando?osama bin laden ko maarane ke liye jab america commando abtabad ke bangale main pahunche to wo sidhe teesri manzil ke us kamare main hi ja dhamke, jisamen osama rahata tha
 Who provided such fine information to America
 khaas baat ye he ki us kamare main osama kii choti bivi amal ke sivaa bahut kam logon ko hi aane-jane kii ijaajat thi
 The Pakistan Home Minister himself is also raising questions about how the seal commandos reached Osama's room
 sil commando ne kyon uske pair main hi goli maari?khabar ye bhi ai ki jab osama ko sil commando ne ghar liya to uske bachaav ke liye uski bivi amal hi saamne ai
 
 
 Seal commandos shot him in the leg
 aakhir amal ko chhodane ke peeche kaaran kya tha
 
 
 After all, other women were also killed in that entire operation
 osama tak pahunchane vaala courier kya amal se miltaa tha?osama mara to sabase pehle yahi khabar ai thi ki abtabad ke ghar main jane vaala courier hi america kaa mubir tha
 
 
 He also met the courier Osama, and at that time, Amal too lived with him
 
 
 pakistani news channel jio tivi ke mutabik, osama ke saath uski jo teen biviyaan rah rahi thim, unka naam he kheriyah sabira, siham sabira or amal al saadah
 He also had two wives - Khairaiah Sabira and Siham Sabira, living in Saudi Arabia, in Osama's Abbottabad bungalow
 amal ke chakkar main osama apni un dono biviyon ko zyada tarjeeh bhi nahin detaa tha
 In such a situation, the question arises that in their old Khunnas and Sautiya dah, those wives did not take the name of Amal
 puri duniya main dehshat machaane vaale aatank ke aakaa kii jab maut ai to bhaagane kaa koi rasta nahin mila
 No time to take up arms
 
 Neither was there a fighter who would fire bullets at one command
 lekin khabar ai ki dar se kaanp rahe osama bin laden ko bachaane kii agar kisi ne koshish kii
 So she was his wives
 lekin ab osama kii sabase choti bivi par shaq jataayaa ja rahaa he ki kahin usne gaddari karke apane pati ko marava to nahin diya
 After all, before explaining why amal-al-saadah would do this, you should know how Osama's life came to be
 jis samay laden america par sabase bada hamalaa karne kii sajeesh rach rahaa tha, usee samay uski mulaakaat yaman kii rahane vaali amal-al-saadah se hui
 The beauty of 17-year-old Amal Al Saadah complimented Laden so much that he forcibly married Amal
 
 
 ye baat saal 2000 kii he
 Then, in the color of Osama, Amal also started coloring
 peshey se doctor amal-al saadah par osama kaa aisa jaadu chadha ki logon kii jaan bachaane kii jagah wo masuumon kaa khun bahaane main osama kaa saath dene lagi
 In 11 years, Amal gave Osama three children - two boys and a girl
 kehete hai ki osama sabase zyada amal par hi bharosa karata tha
 Because Amal is as beautiful, her mind runs faster than that
 or shaayad apane usee shaatir dimag kaa istemaal karke amal ne osama ko nipta diya
 But why would Amal have done this
 jaankaron ke mutabik osama ne paanch shaadiyaan kii thi or aakhri samay main bhi wo teen biviyon ke saath rahata tha
 In such a situation, it may be that Osama had to pay for the battle of wives
 doosraa kaaran ye ho saktaa he ki osama ne amal ko jabardasti apni bivi banaaya tha
 Even though Osama considered Amal very much, he liked Hamza, who is not son of Amal but Khairaiah Sabira's son
 (khufia jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki umr kaa faasla or osama kii jor-jabardasti se amal khafa rahati hogi
 But for fear of Osama she would not be able to speak anything
 jab use laga hoga ki osama ab kamjor ho rahaa he to ho saktaa he ki america kii jasoos banakar usne apane jaalim pati kaa kaam tamaam kara diya hoga
 ) After killing Osama bin Laden in the house of Abbottabad, the seal commandos took his corpse with him, but 15 or 16 people including Osama's three wives and some children were captured by Pakistan
 osama ke aakhri samay main uske saath uski teen biviyaan thim
 Osama bin Laden, the world's biggest terrorist, had a total of five marriages
 osama ne pehali shaadi najwa ganim se, duusari shaadi khadjiyah sharif se, teesri shaadi kheriyah sabira se, chauthi shaadi siham sabira se or paanchavi shaadi amal-al-saadah se kii
 By the age of 26, Osama had done two marriages
 pehali bivi osama ke khauf ke chalate khamosh rahati thi to duusari bivi apane iraade jaahir karne main kabhi peeche nahin hatati thi
 Later he also got divorced
 28 saal kii umr main osama kii teesri shaadi karwaai uski pehali bivi najwa ne
 Whose name was Khayriyah Sabira
 osama kii teenon bivio main kheriyah sabase zyada padhi likhi thi
 Being knowledgeable in Islamic matters, Khayriyah explained Osama more deeply to Islam
 lekin majahab ke safed pahalu to unhen dikhe nahin, alabatta ek jaisi kattar or unmaadi soch ne dono ko behad kareeb laa diya
 Osama was born to his most beloved son Hamza from that Khayriyah
 wo hamaja, jise uske baap se bhi zyada beraham or kattar mana jaataa he
 Khairiyah remained with Osama even after the 9–11 attack
 
 
 kheriyah ke bare main ye khabar bhi aati rahi ki tora-bora kii pahadiyon se lekar abtabad kii haveli tak kheriyah saaye kii tarah osama ke saath- saath rahati thi
 When the third wife was very loyal and Osama got the choice, she got married only after two years, ie, at the age of 30
 osama kii chauthi shaadi hui siham sabira se
 
 
 This was the time when Osama decided that he had to follow the path of Jihad
 
 
 siham se laden ko 4 bachche paidaa hue
 After 9 / 11, Khairiyah i
e
 Osama's third wife along with his fourth wife Siham also moved to Afghanistan with Osama
 inhen kheriyah or siham ke saath amal bhi osama ke abtabad vaale bangale main rahati thi
 Perhaps the three were not made, and what is known about their hatred, whistleblower made Osama a victim of death
 osama ke bare main khabar aa rahi he ki jis bivi ko
 
 wo sabase zyada chahta tha, usee bivi kii bevafaayee ne
 
 uskaa kaam tamaam kar diya
 But the question arises whether Osama
 
 He loved his wives with heart
 yaa phir wo
 
 uske liye bas khilne kaa khilonaa bhar thim
 Her will published in a newspaper tells that to her wives
 
 What did Osama think? osama bin laden ne khud to paanch shaadiyaan kii lekin apni biviyon se chahta tha ki wo kabhi kisi or mard se shaadi naa karen
 a few days after Osama died, a Kuwait newspaper reported that Osama had written his will ten years before his death
 us vasiyat main usne apni biviyon ko hukum diya tha ki uske marane ke baad wo kabhi dobaaraa shaadi naa karen
 It is said that he wanted his last and 25 years younger wife, Amal, from Dilozan, but he also forcibly married Amal
 osama kii pehali bivi ko jab osama kaa rang-dhang pasand nahin aayaa to wo saath chhodkar chali gayi
 The second wife got divorced while the last three wives lived with her
 darasal osama ne kabhi bhi apni biviyon ko apni juuti se zyada tarjeeh nahin di wo kabhi apni kisi bivi kaa vafaadaar nahin rahaa lekin chahta tha ki uski biviyon kii vafadari main fark naa aae

 Two news reports from Karnataka on Monday indicate that the end of this drama is near, while the politics of the state is also taking a turn
 vidhansabha adhyaksh ne bayaan diya ki mukhyamantri kumaar swami ko sadan main bahumat sabit karne ke liye kaha gaya he
 The motion of confidence will be discussed on 18 July
 duusari taraf ieme ghotaale main ghire congress se nilambit shivajinagar se vidhayak or pradesh ke purv mantri roshan beg ko vishesh jaanch dal (esaiti) ne hiraasat main le liya
 At the same time, BJP has been rejecting the allegations of the ruling party and has said openly that all 15 mlas are in touch with it
 in sabake bich ab satta kii baaji koun jitegaa, yah 18 july ko hi pataa chalegaa
 On the custody of Roshan Baig, BJP attacker SIT issued a statement saying that Baig was detained from Bangalore Airport while he was boarding a charter plane to go to Pune in Maharashtra
 esaiti ke is kadam par vipakshi bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) ne sarkaar par hamalaa bolte hue sarkari mashinari ke durupyog or sarkari sansthaaon kaa istemaal kar apane hi vidhayakon ko daraane or blackmel karne kaa aarope lagaaya
 Kumaraswamy also retaliated, Shivakumar expressed his anger, while Kumaraswamy also referred to the presence of BJP MLA Yogeshwar while detaining Roshan Baig, accusing the BJP of trying to drive away the ex-minister accused in a case, as shameful
 kumaraswami ne kaha ki bhaajapa harse trading kar sarkaar ko asthir kar rahi he
 Congress leader DK Shivakumar, who has been trying to persuade the rebels for the last few days, expressed confidence of the rebels returning and voting in favor of the government
 sivakumar ne iske peeche sadsyta jane ke khatre ko vajah bataaya
 Both the parties are claiming to vote in their favor of the rebels, on the other hand, the movement of the rebels staying in the hotel in Mumbai has been banned
 hotel par suraksha bhi badha di gai he
 The BJP said openly for the first time, both the Congress and JDS parties in rebel contact were accusing the BJP of horse trading to destabilize the state government since the beginning of this drama
 bhaajapa ise donon dalon kaa aantarik maamla bataa isamen kisi bhi tarah se apni bhoomika se inkaar karti rahi
 Now that the date has been set to discuss the confidence motion, BJP leader and former Chief Minister of the state BS Yeddyurappa has expressed his confidence in the majority saying that 15 mlas present in Mumbai are in touch with us

 This decision of the speaker came just before the hearing in the Supreme Court on the petition of the rebel mlas for not accepting their resignation
 satta paksh or vipaksh ke netaaon ke saath charchaa kar spikar ne yah nirnay tab liya, jab vah sanvaidhanik pad par rahakar vidhayakon ke istife par faisla taalane ke aarope jhel rahe the
 The speaker was being accused that he was deferring the decision on the resignation of rebel mlas only because he could get enough time to save the Kumaraswamy government and control the damage
 yediurppa kii raah chalenge kumaraswamikarnataka kaa siyaasi jang ab nirnaayak mode par pahunch gaya he
 Chief Minister Kumaraswamy has to prove his majority in the assembly, which seems extremely difficult in the present scenario
 ab dekhnaa yah hoga ki kya kumaraswami vishwaas prastaav par charchaa ko mat vibhaajan tak pahunchane denge yaa vidhansabha chunaav ke baad sarkaar banaakar vishwaas prastaav par charchaa ke baad bagaiyr mat vibhaajan hi istipha de dene vaale yediurppa kii raah chal rajyapal ko istipha saunp denge?

 When the police started investigating and gathering evidence, a very strange case emerged that Alisha and her brother-in-law were together during the entire murder
 jaanch main bahanoi ne mana ki in donon ke pehle se bhi rishte the or vah aleesha ko sirf apana bana kar rakhana chahta tha
 Alisha was an open-minded girl and also interacted with her classmates and colleagues who did not like it
 isi kaaran shaq main saali kii barbar tareeke se hatya kar di

 aspx chhattisgarh ke durg jile main police ne chaar saal kii bacchee se balaatkaar karne ke aarope main yuvak ko giraftaar kiya he
 Additional Superintendent of Police, Durg, Prashant Thakur said that the police arrested a 19-year-old youth, Narendra Kumar, in the village of Bhupcdih under Utai police station area of the district for raping a four-year-old girl
 thakur ne bataaya ki narendra bacchee ke pados main rahata he
 On Wednesday evening, when the girl was playing outside the house, Narendra took her to a place to keep a crop with her and allegedly raped her
 is dauraan narendra ne bacchee ke saath marpet bhi kii thi
 He said that when some women from the village passed by during the incident, they heard the baby's voice
 mahilaon ne narendra ko lagbhag ek kilometre dur tak peechha karke pakad liya or use police ke hawaale kar diya
 The police officer said that the police has admitted the girl to the hospital, where her condition remains critical
 idhar, jile main bacchee ke saath balaatkaar kii khabar ke baad vipakshi dal congress ke sthaneey vidhayak or anya kaaryakartaaon ne jiladhish karyaalay kaa gheraav kiya tathaa aaropee ko faansee dene kii maang kii he
 During the Gujarat election campaign, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) President Amit Shah had said that the BJP would win more than 150 seats in Gujarat
 unke is vishwaas ke peeche modi magic par bharose kaa haath tha
 After 2014, except for Punjab, Bihar and Delhi, Modi magic was burning
 khaskar uttar pradesh main modi magic voters ke sir chadhakar bolaa
 Though the Gujarat election results may have made the BJP the Sardar of the state, but for this they had to struggle
 aise main sawaal khadey ho rahe hai ki bijepi kab tak modi magic ke sahare jitate rahegi?100 par hi simat gai bijepi2012 gujarat main bijepi ko 115 siten mili thim, bijepi ko 47
 9 percent votes were received
 vahiin congress ko 2012 main 61 siton par jeet darj kii thi, congress ko 38
 9 percent votes were received
 vahiin is baar ab tak ke rujhaanon ke mutabik bijepi ko 100 ke aas paas siten or 49 vot pratishat milti hui dikhaai de rahi he
 At the same time, both the vote share and seats of Congress have increased
 congress ko 80 ke aas paas siten or 43 pratishat ke aasapaas vot milte hue najar aa rahe hai
 On the other hand, when compared to 2014, in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, if you talk about the vote percentage then BJP 60 in Gujarat
 1 fisadi vot mili agar vidhansabha ke hisaab se dekhen to 162 siten or vahiin congress ko 33
 5 per cent of the vote, 17 seats per seat
 aise main gujarat chunaav ke nateezon se bijepi adhyaksh amit shah or duusare netaaon kaa 150 siton kaa daawa jhootha sabit hua
 At the same time, BJP could not even reach the performance of previous elections
 aise main kah sakate hai ki modi magic ke sahare ek baar phir bijepi ko jeet mili ho, lekin yah kab tak jari rahegi, yah kahana mushkil he
 The BJP and PM Narendra had given a lot of strength in Modi's election campaign in Rallyungurat
 piem modi ko gujarat chunaav main ulatpher hone kaa andeshaa ho gaya tha
 This is the reason that he himself had to hold rallies during the election
 yahi vajah he ki piem modi kii mehnat rang laai or aakhirkaar bijepi bahumat se kuch siten zyada laane main safal rahi
 All the Union ministers were not sure about Modi Modi himself in the election campaign
 yahi vajah he ki unhone apane saath apni puri cabinet ko bhi gujarat chunaav prachaar main laga diya tha
 Not only this, Modi also took full support of Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath in Gujarat
 saare mantri or mukhyamantri milakar bhi 2014 kaa karishma or upi chunaav kaa jalawaa gujarat main nahin doharaa paae
 At the last moment, the Emotional Card (mani Shankar's statement), while struggling in power in Gujarat, got the Sanjeevani boot at the last moment from the controversial statement of Congress leader Mani Shankar
 manishankar ke bayaan ko modi ne khub cash kiya or ise gujarat kii janata se jodate hue kaaphi bhaavnaatmak bayaan die
 In such a result, the effect of Modi's emotional statements is more visible except for Modi Magic
 ab rajasthan main hone vaale chunaav kii baari he
 It is to be seen if the BJP will be able to retain the government there
 Looking at Gujarat, it has become clear that the path will not be easy for the BJP

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi attended the program on the second day of India Today Conclave 2019 on Saturday
 pradhanmantri ne suraksha, arthvyavastha, kisaan, rojgaar, shiksha or infrastracchar jaise kai muddon par apni baat rakhi
 In his address, he said that the tagline of 'aaj Tak' is 'fastest', then our government is also known for doing the fastest work
 pradhanmantri ne kaha ki 'mujhe yaad he, 2014 se pehle studio main bhi charchaa hoti thi ki modi duniya main kya chal rahaa he, uski to modi ko samaj hi nahin he, aise main hamaari videsh niti kaa kya hoga? lekin beete dinon ke ghatnakram main aapako dikhaai de gaya hoga ki bharat kii videsh niti kaa prabhaav aaj kya he
 He also said that he did not know Delhi but in 2014 the same thing proved to be a boon for him
 pradhanmantri ne kaha ki aaj kaa nayaa bharat nidar he, nirbhik he or nirnaayak he
 Today, the government is moving ahead with the faith and effort of 125 crore Indians
 bharatiyon kii is ekajutata ne hi desh ke bheetar or baahar kuch deshvirohi logon main ek dar paidaa kiya he
 i would say that this fear is good
 jab dushman main bharat ke parakram kaa dar ho, to ye dar acha he
 When there is a fear of the valor of the soldiers in the terrorists, then this fear is good
 jab bhagodon main bhi kanoon or apni sampatti zabt hone kaa dar ho, to ye dar acha he
 The Prime Minister said that this fear is good when big families get shocked by speaking of their maternal uncle
 jab bhrasht netaaon ko bhi jail jane kaa dar sataae, to ye dar acha he
 When there is fear of law even among the corrupt, this fear is good
 ab ye nayaa bharat apane samarthy, apane saadhan, apane sansadhano par bharosa karte hue aage bad rahaa he, apni buniyadi kamajoriyon ko dur karne kaa, apni chunautiyon ko kam karne kaa prayaas kar rahaa he
 'see the full speech of PM Modi, he further said, the country has felt the lack of Rafael today
 aaj hindustan ek swar main kah rahaa he ki agar hamaare paas rafel hota, to kya hota? rafel par pehle swaarthniti ke kaaran or ab raajnneeti ke kaaran desh kaa bahut nuksaan hua he
 The Prime Minister also said that if you want to oppose Modi, then do the deficiencies, draw loopholes in our schemes, you are always welcome, but do not oppose the security interests of the country, the interest of the country
 aap ye dhyaan rakhie ki modi virodh kii isi jid main masood ajahar or hafiz said jaise aatankiyon ko, aatank ke saraparaston ko sahaara na mil jaae
 Speaking to the media after the fall of Yeddyurappa government in Karnataka, Congress President Rahul Gandhi has directly attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 rahul ne kaha ki pradhanmantri narendra modi desh or desh ke logon or sanvaidhanik sansthaaon se upar nahin hai
 The Congress President said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's attitude is not democratic, but dictatorial
 congress adhyaksh ne kaha ki bharat main takat kuch nahin he
 People's will is everything
 hamane janata ko bataaya or bijepi ke ahankaar kii seemaa bhi ginai
 There is a limit to how this country is run
 rahul ne kaha ki pradhanmantri kaa model loktantric nahin, taanaashaahee vaala he
 Giving a message to Narendra Modi, he said that the Prime Minister is not bigger than India
 piem janata, supreme court, sansad, vidhansabha se bada nahin ho saktaa
 They need to stop thinking this
 unhen samajhnaa hoga ki har santhaan kaa sammaan karnaa hoga, jis tareeke se unki training hui he mujhe shaq he ki sangh kisi ko apane saamne sammaan detaa he
 Rahul said that the people of the country saw on television that BJP mlas got up before the national anthem was played in the Karnataka Assembly
 ye unka swabhaav he ki ve hindustan ke kisi bhi santhaan kii izzat nahin karte hai
 i am proud that the people of Karnataka have shown to the Prime Minister, BJP President and the assassin Amit Shah that they cannot buy democracy
 unhone kaha ki bharat main takat or paisa hi sabakuch nahin he
 i hope the BJP and RSS have learned a lesson from Karnataka
 media ke saamne khuleam bijepi ne congress or jedies ke vidhayakon ko kharidne kii koshish kii
 Rahul said that in Karnataka we protected the voice of the people
 agar bijepi ko bahumat hota to ham bijepi ko sarkaar banane dete
 But the truth is that BJP does not have public support
 jedies or hamaare vidhayakon ko joden to sarkaar hamaari banati he
 We have protected the voice of the people of Karnataka here
 ham har pradesh kii janata kii aawaaj kii raksha karenge
 Where it seems that this is happening in the country, the Congress party will be seen
 ham sab milakar, vipaksh ko-ordinate kar bijepi ko haraayega
 The Congress president said that the BJP is attacking 100 percent of all institutions
 media ko bhi
 Some of you are brave, some need support
 piem kaa jo model he, wo taanaashaahee vaala he, loktantric nahin
 The Sangh wants its control over all institutions
 piem modi ke empi, vidhayak bhi mahasoos kar sakate hai
 Rahul said that the Prime Minister approved the horse-trading of Congress and JDS mlas
 pradhanmantri kehete hai ki ve bhrashtachar se lard rahe hai, lekin asal main ve bhrashtachar hai
 We have kept the phone conversation in public
 ve log sochate hai ki desh kii har sanstha ko jhukaa sakate hai, or tabah kar sakate hai
 One by one they are insulting the mandate
 ek sawaal ke jawaab main rahul ne kaha ki main jativaadee nahin hum, aprishyata main vishwaas nahin karata
 Whether or not Governor Vajubhai Wala resigns is a separate issue, but the country's constitutional institutions are under constant attack
 agar aap ek ko badal dete hai, to doosraa aane ke baad vahi karata he
 This is a very important issue

 unhone kaha tha, sangeet ek vyapak vishay he
 Music consists of mathematics and grammar
 jab tak ek vyakti sabakuch jaan nahin letaa, vah acha gayak nahin ban saktaa
 One should learn music for 15 years before singing Ghazal
