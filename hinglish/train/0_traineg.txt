 Due to the look of his angry young man, Rahul Gandhi was attacking the PM Modi, but when Rahul returned to Lucknow after a break of three days, there was a lot of revenge
 bole- mujhase gale miliye, modi to obama se gale milengelkhanu se dobaaraa apniyatra shuru karnerahulpahunche to clin shev the, chehre se engri yang main kaa luk gaayab tha, yatra ke is daur main rahul apane maasoom chehre ke saath kisaanon ko bula-bulaakar gale mil rahe hai
 Rahul Gandhi's motive is to call himself the biggest supporter of the farmers and to show Modi a man running away from the farmers, only then Rahul is taking Modi's name for a hug too
 rahul kehete hai, 'aaie mujhase gale miliye, modi ji bhi gale mil sakate hai lekin wo to obama se gale milenge wo garib kisaan or majdoor se gale nahin mil sakate
 'in this period of throwing shoes, Rahul is talking more about love and brotherhood, Rahul is raising the issue of throwing shoes at every meeting and saying that throw as many shoes as you want, but i back from the point of brotherhood will not budge
 baharhaal rahul kii yatra ab pashchimi uttar pradesh main panhuch rahi he jahaan pehle se dharmik dhruvikaran bahut zyada he
 In such a situation, Rahul Gandhi is leaving the image of his angry young man and going among the people with that image, in which love and brotherhood are also reflected in his gesture

 People on Twitter are unable to find an answer
 kisi kaa jawaab 16 nikal rahaa he to kisi kaa 1
 (2 + 2) = 4 8 / 2 = 4 4 (4) = 16 (2 + 2) 4 8 / 2(4) According to PEMDAS you need to get rid of parathenses first so 2(4)=8 8 / 8 = 1 answer is one
 It's either 1 or 16 depending on which mathematician you listen to, because order of operations isn't a hard and fast rule, and math is really just a language

 aaj mobile manuphaccharing companiyon kii sankhya 120 ho gai he
 If there are 120 companies, then export will have started or imports will have decreased
 sab kuch nahin to bahut kuch bharat main banane laga hoga jiske kaaran rojgaar paidaa hua hoga
 On 18 October 2018 i wrote a blog
 hindustan times ke vineet sachdev kii report ke aadhaar par ki bharat ne 2014 main china se 6
 3 billion dollars of mobile phones were imported which decreased in 2017 and 3
 3 arab dollar kaa hi aayaat hua
 You will feel that this is a big success
 bharat main hi mobile phone banane laga he
 But other figures show that imports of mobile part components have increased significantly
 2014 main mobile phone ke part-purza kaa aayaat 1
 It was only 3 billion dollars, now 9 in 2017
 4 arab dollar kaa ho gaya he
 Thus, the total imports of mobile and mobile part components between 2014 and 2017 7
 6 arab dollar se badhkar 12
 7 billion dollars

 NK Goyal, president of the Telecom Equipment Manufacturers Association of India, has urged the government to review its policies
 cellular oparator association of india ne telecom department ko khat likhaa he ki chini companiyon ko aane se nahin roka jaae
 Why is there so much controversy about HUAWEI? Surjeet Das Gupta of Business Standard has written a long report on this
 bataaya he ki 2010 main jab HUAWEI or ZTE ne jiesem mobile line ke liye tender main bhaag lene kii koshish kii thi
 But then the Indian government directed BSNL to stop these two companies
 us vakt kai chini mobile companiyon or bhartiya companiyon ke saajha qaraar ko bhi radd kar diya gaya tha
 The basis for the cancellation was that Chinese equipment may have spy equipment
 lekin baad main anumati de di gai kyonki iske liye niyam badal die gaye
 That the mobile companies will also share their designs and devices can be tested
 tab bhi beasenel ne iske khilaaf custom vibhaag main chunauti di thi
 Now the question is why the Indian government has become soft about these companies
 jis company ko 2010 kii sarkaar ne roak diya tha, us company ko 2014 kii baad vaali sarkaar kyon aane de rahi he? is sawaal par aane se pehle bijness standard ke surajeet das gupta ne likhaa he ki bhartiya mobile companiyon ko dar lagata he ki chini companiyon ke mobile ke aage ve nahin tik paaengi
 Because Chinese phones are 30 percent cheaper
 isiilie telecom equipment and services export pramotion(tepc) ne rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar ajit dobhaal ko likhaa he ki in companiyon ko rashtrahit main anumati na di jaae
 Other companies have also banned them
 mana jaataa he ki kisi bhi zarurat ke mutabik phone banane kii isaki kshamta kaa muqabla europe kii companiyaan nahin kar sakati hai
 HUAWEI has a good ability to make equipment for 5G
 america kaa maananaa he ki iske kaaran uski rashtriya suraksha ke saath samjhauta ho saktaa he
 If the penetration of this company deepens, then it can threaten the power grid to defense institutions
 agar america or china ke sambandh bigade to waisi sthiti main chini sarkaar apni company se kah sakati he ki vah apane upkarnon se jasusi kare or america kii sanchaar vyavastha thapp kar de
 The CEO of the phone company says that these things have no basis

 Filmmaker Karan Johar, who is awaiting the release of his upcoming film Ae Dil Hai Mushkil, says that the demand for a ban on Pakistani artists is not a solution to the problem like terrorism

 naukari main maratha or muslimon ko aarakshan die jane ke maharashtra sarkaar ke adhyadesh par hoicourt kii roak ke baad fadanvis sarkaar ne mangalvaar ko aanan fanan main vidhansabha main maratha aarakshan bill pesh kar diya
 The bill brought by the bjp-shiv Sena government was passed in the House, but the opposition surrounded the government to do nothing on reservation for Muslims
 ab rajya sarkaar is bill ko buudhvaar ko vidhaan parishad se paas karaane kii taiyaari kar rahi he taaki court ko jaankaree di sake ki sarkari naukari va shiksha sansthaanon main marathiyon ko 16 fisadi aarakshan milegaa
 Let us tell you that the previous Congress government of Maharashtra had issued an ordinance a few days before the assembly elections, which provides for reservation of 16 per cent for Marathis and five per cent for Muslims in jobs and education
 haalanki bombai hoicourt ne 14 november ko apane aadesh main adhyadesh ke lagu hone par roak laga diya tha, lekin musalamaanon ko sirf shiksha main paanch fisadi aarakshan die jane ko barkaraar rakhaa tha
 The 6 months of this ordinance are being completed on 25 December
 adhyadesh ke nirast hone se pehle sarkaar maratha aarakshan bill ko paas kara lenaa chaah rahi he
 This strategy of the government has come under attack from the opposition
 ensipi or congress muslim aarakshan ko lekar fadanvis sarkaar ke ravaiye par sawaal uthaa rahi he
 The court upheld the decision to provide five percent reservation in education to Muslims, the ordinance would be repealed if the government does not bring any bill in this regard
 vipaksh kaa kahana he ki bijepi sarkaar ne aisa jaanboojhkar kiya he
 Leader of the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly Opposition Radhakrishna Visakhe said, 'the Fadnavis government deliberately did not bring the Muslim reservation bill
 court ne bhi shiksha main muslimon ke liye aarakshan ko barkaraar rakhaa tha
 The government should have brought the Muslim reservation bill along with the Maratha reservation bill
 ' vahiin ensipi netaa ajit pavaar kaa kahana he ki jab se modi sarkaar ai he, bijepi puure desh main hindu raashtra kaa vichaar thomp rahi he
 The Fadnavis government is silent on this issue amid a fierce opposition attack
 vah muslim aarakshan par kuch bhi kehane se batch rahi he
 The problem is that even when the farmers come to Delhi, no one listens, and even when they come to the media, no one matters
 aisa nahin he ki sarkaar kuch karne kaa daawa nahin karti he, uske tamaam daavon or yojanaon or unki website ke baad bhi kheti kaa sankat jahaan tahaan se nikal hi aata he
 The farmers have come again to Jantar Mantar
 madhyapradesh ke mandsaur se akhil bhartiya kisaan sangharsh samanvay samiti ne kisaan mukti yatra nikaali, jo 6 rajyon se hote hue dilli pahunchi he
 More than 150-200 farmer organizations of the country are supporting this journey

 In the hope that the people of Delhi will be heard
 jantar mantar par chal rahe kisaan mukti sansad main do hi maangen pramukh hai
 The farmers should get the full price of the crop and the farmers should be completely debt free

 You audience will also know these mps or leaders, but on this platform many farmer leaders also gave speeches which you do not know, which we do not even know as journalists, but they are the voice of the farmers in their respective areas
 unke netaa hai
 It was announced that now the fight for full salvation with full price and debt will be done
 kisaan daam maang rahe hai
 The BJP promised that profits would be fixed by adding fifty per cent to the cost
 abhi tak is vaade ke intazaar main hai
 The government no longer speaks on this promise but talks of doubling the income of farmers by 2022
 sarkaar ko yahi bataanaa chahie ki is vakt kisaanon kii aamadani kitni he or 2022 main dugani hokar kitni ho jaaegi
 Farmers are demanding that if it costs Rs 1500 to grow one quintal of wheat, then add 750 rupees to it, that is, Rs 2250 per quintal
 is vakt gehun kaa nunatam samarthan mulya 1625 rupee he
 Whenever the farmers get suicidal news in the media, then their family is missing from that news
 marane vaale kisaan kii patni kaa sangharsh or unke bacchon par manovaigyanik asar kaa zikr to kabhi aata bhi nahin
 The failure of these children to come to Jantar Mantar from Maharashtra is our failure
 main jaanata hum ki ab ham sab apni har tarah kii naakaami se saamaanya ho chuke hai
 It does not matter, but these children are trying one more time that if the governments that cry false tears do something, then where is their effect
 kya us vyavastha ko shame aa rahi he jisane in bacchon ko sirf aashwaasan diya he
 Compensation has been given, but where is the solution to the farmers' problem
 kab hoga
 Watch the rallies of the leaders
 wo har chunaav main aaleeshaan hoti ja rahi hai
 Where does he get so much money from? kya aap vaaki maanate hai ki wo white mani kaa paisa reliyon main uda rahe hai
 Why the politics of the country where politics blows the note does not solve these questions
 aakhir netaaon ke aish to kabhi kam nahin hote hai, kya aapane kabhi netaa ko train se chalakar chunaav prachaar par jate dekha he, to phir ye kisaan kaise mar rahe hai
 Why their children are being orphaned

 On 16 July, when these farmers went to meet the Prime Minister, they were arrested

 The struggle of the wife of the dying farmer and the psychological impact on his children is never mentioned
 maharashtra se chalakar jantar mantar par in bacchon kaa aana ham sabaki naakaami he
 i know that now we are all normal with our failure
 fark nahin padataa, magar ye bachche ek or baar prayaas kar rahe hai ki jhuthe aansu rone vaali sarkarein agar kuch karti hai to unka asar kahaan he
 Is shame on the system that has just given assurance to these children
 muawza diya he magar kisaanon kii samasya kaa samaadhaan kahaan he
 when will it happen
 netaaon kii reliyaan dekhiye
 She is becoming plush in every election

 Do you really believe that he is blowing money in rallies of white money
 jis desh kii raajnneeti jahaan chak kar note udaati he us desh kii raajnneeti kyon nahin in sawaalon kaa samaadhaan karti he
 After all, the ash of the leaders is never diminished, have you ever seen the leader walking by train and going for election campaign, then how are these farmers dying
 unke bachche kyon anaath ho rahe hai
 The comments ham in pariwaron kii kahani nahin jaanate

 Sometimes he has to pretend to cry for the unnamed laborers who die in the gutter, sometimes he has to cry for martyrdom, sometimes for the circumstances of the country

 Yeddyurappa is once again engaged in raising the ears of the BJP national leadership
 pehle to unhone di
 V
 sadanand gauda ko apana uttaradhikari banwaaya, ab unhen hataakar apane ek anya vishwasi jagadish shettar ko ku rsi par baitaane kii maang kar rahe hai
 The party's national leadership has to decide before July 16
 sadanand gauda se yeddiurppa isliye khafa hai ki satta sanbhaalane ke baad unhone sakht 'bhrashtachar-virdohi' line pakad lee jiske kaaran yeddiurppa kii kai tarah kii gatividhiyaan puri tarah thap pad gayi
 Along with this, Gowda selectively removed all the trusted people of Yeddyurappa from the Chief Minister's Office and took special care that Yeddyurappa should not interfere in any matter
 varisht bijepi netaa laalkrishna adwani ne gauda ko badalane ke kisi bhi kadam kaa is aadhaar par virodh kiya he ki ek mukhyamantri ko bina kisi kaaran nahin hataaya ja saktaa
 But it seems that the rest of the central leaders are willing to accept Yeddyurappa's new choice
 party ke ek virashth vichaarak ne kaha, ''rashtriya netritv ne kai kaarnon se yeddiurppa kii ichchhaaon ko maanane kaa faisla kiya he
 The most important of these is that we want to keep the Lingayat community connected
 '' rajya kii 6
 The Lingayat community accounts for between 18 and 21 per cent of the 5 crore population and former Chief Minister Yeddyurappa is still considered the undisputed leader of this largest community in Karnataka
 yeddiurppa ko ummid thi ki gauda kathputli kii tarah kaam karenge, lekin aisa nahin hua or yeddiurppa unase khafa ho gaye
 Gowda has made a mark as a 'clean' Chief Minister
 yeddiurppa or unke parivaar ke khilaaf vibhinn adaalaton main darj jameen hadapney or rishwat ke maamalon main gauda ne na to kisi tarah kaa koi hastkshep kiya or na hi unhen bachaane kii koi koshish kii
 On the contrary, Gowda has made every effort to end corruption in the administration and in this case he did not make any concessions even with the portfolios of ministers close to Yeddyurappa
 party ke ek sutara ishaara karte hai, ''iskaa nateeja yah he ki yeddiurppa kheme kii kamai ke raste band ho gaye hai
 That is why they are angry with Gowda
 '' sutron kaa kahana he ki yeddiurppa ne shettar ke saath yah sochakar haath milaayaa he ki ve unki baat maanenge
 Since 2008, when Karnataka became the gateway for the BJP to enter the southern part of the country, the party's national leadership has had to bow to every wish or whims of Yeddyurappa
 lekin is baar kendriya netaa anya kaarnon se shettar kaa samarthan kar rahe hai
 The party feels that if Shettar becomes the chief minister, it will be easy for him to reduce Yeddyurappa's influence
 party sutron ne india today se kaha, ''uttari karnataka main lingayat hamaara mukhya vot bank he or shettar isi se taalluk rakhte hai
 If Yeddyurappa's thinking changes further, as he is doing in Gowda's case, it will not be easy for him to demand a replacement of Shettar
 or yadi vah aisa karte bhi hai to unka samarthan aadhaar ku chha to khiskegaa hi
 The Lingayat community left the Congress in 1990 when the then national president of the party, Rajiv Gandhi, replaced his leader, the ailing Chief Minister Virendra Patil
 bangarappa ko kursi de di thi
 Rajiv Gandhi announced the change of chief minister in front of the media at the Bangalore airport, which was quite exasperating to Lingayat community
 tab se congress ne phir se lingayat samudaay kaa dil jeetne kii kai baar koshish kii lekin lingayat kaa mote taur par samarthan patil ke puraane mitra ramkri shna hegade ko miltaa rahaa
 The reason for this was that despite being a Brahmin, Hegde was always known as a supporter of the Lingayat community
 hegade kii mrityu or janata dal parivaar ke chhin-bhinn ho jane ke baad lingayat samudaay ne apni nishtha badal lee or rajya main bijepi ke sansthaapak sadsy or tatkaaleen pradesh adhyaksh yeddiurppa kaa daaman tham liya
 With the support of Lingayat, BJP reached power in 2008 and Yeddyurappa emerged as the most powerful Chief Minister of the state
 yeddiurppa ke satta se baahar hote hi samudaay kii soch main badlaav kii ek aahat sun congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ne 29 april ko unhen lubhaane kii koshish kii
 He saw the Shivkumar Swami of the most influential Lingayat Guru Tumkuru's Siddaganga Mutt and on the 105th birth anniversary of the lord of the monastery, praising his charitable works
 05 karod ru
 Donated lekin yeddiurppa ke baad sabase prabhaavshaalee lingayat netaa shettarane ise sire se khaarij kar diya
 He told India Today, "this is definitely an attempt by Congress to woo our community and harm our vote bank
" lekin isse koi fark nahin padane vaala
 Going to the monastery of a national leader and joining a program just once is not going to change the atmosphere
 ''yeddiurppa virdohi khemaa taaja ghatnakram ko lekar kaaphi khush he
 "the demand of Yeddyurappa to hand over power to Shettar instead of Gowda is a political mistake," says a cabinet minister
 gauda ke kathputli nahin banane se yeddiurppa itane naaraaz hue ki unhone ek aise vikalp ko aajamaane kaa faisla kar liya jo apekshaakrit kam ghaatak ho
 It will be an interesting political game indeed as many ministers supporting Yeddyurappa are not going to stand in favor of Shettar

 kareeb 10 maheene tak hafiz apane ghar main najarband tha lekin pakistan kii adaalat ne vahaan kii prantiy sarkaar kii us maang ko khaarij kar diya jisame najarbandi ko 3 maheene or badhaane kii maang thi
 Sweets distributed in the court: What did the Pakistani court order for the release of Hafiz Saeed? Sweets started distributing in the court
 haalanki pakistan kii pole khul chuki he or america kii bhi maamle par puri najar he
 America has said that Hafiz is still on the list of international terrorists
 celibrity kii tarah pahunchaa tha courtatank ke sabase bade aakaa hafiz said ke pakistan main rutabe kaa andaja aap court main uski entry se laga sakate hai
 Hafiz Saeed had reached the court like a celebrity to appear before the Judicial Review Board for the hearing
 gaadi par gulab kii pankhudiyaan aise bikhri thim maano koi jang fatahakar raja apane ghar lautaa ho
 Hafizhafiz Saeed is the mastermind of Mumbai's 26 / 11 attack 72 hours before the Mumbai attack
 gaur kiijie to pataa chalata he ki pakistani adaalat ne mumbai hamale kii nauveen barsi se kareeb 72 ghante pehle hafiz ko khuli hawa kaa tohfa diya he
 However, we should not be surprised because such lies of Pakistan are perpetual
 paak sarkaar roak sakati he rihaai!haalanki ish maamle main sutron kaa kahana he ki pakistan sarkaar taaja halaaton main aatanki sargana hafiz said ko khulaa nahin chhod sakati
 So she can detain Hafiz in another case
 hafiz kii rihaai kii surat main pakistan sarkaar ko baari antarrashtriya dabaav jhelana pad saktaa he
 Because for a long time, the Trump government has taken a strong stand on terrorism
 aapako yah bhi yaad dilaa den ki 2012 main america ne hafiz said ke sir par 1 karod america dollar kaa inaam bhi rakhaa tha
 Government of India gave a strong response: The Indian government sources have reacted sharply to the nefarious release of Hafiz
 sarkari sutron ne kaha ki yah faisla dikhaata he ki pakistan aatankwaad ke mudde par kis tarah antarrashtriya samudaay kii ankhon main dhul jhonk rahaa he
 He said that it also reflects Islamabad's double attitude of curbing terrorism

 ayodhya ram mandir maamla supreme court main he, lekin usase pehle mandir nirmaan ko lekar samarthak netaaon or santon kii bayaanbaji joro par he
 Sadhvi Prachi, who is associated with BJP leader and Vishwa Hindu Parishad, raised her voice on the construction of the temple and said that on December 6, Ram will lay the foundation stone of the temple
 talkatoraa stadium main yojit akhil bhartiya sant samiti ke dharma desh main sadhvi praachi ne kaha ki 6 disambar ko babari kaa dhaancha giraaya gaya tha
 If there is no announcement of construction of Ram temple by or before 6 December, then the Sant Samaj itself will announce the construction of Ram temple
 unhone kaha, 'ram ji kaa mandir banegaa dhooma-dham se
 We have to lay the foundation stone only on 6 December
 ayodhya ke andar hindustan ke hinduon ko bulaao, ram mandir kii ghoshnaa karo
 No need ram mandir ban jayega
 Apart from Sadhvi Prachi, Ram Vilas Vedanti, president of Ramjanmabhoomi Nyas has also given a big statement
 ram vilaas vedanti ne kaha ki disambar main ram mandir kaa nirmaan shuru ho jayega
 Ram Vilas Vedanti claimed that without ordinance, a Ram temple would be built in Ayodhya through mutual consent and a mosque would be built in Lucknow
 supreme court se rasta nahin niklaa to aayega bill- ramdeowahin, yogaguru baba ramdev ne ram mandir nirmaan par kaha ki nyaayalay se nirnay main deree hui to sansad main iskaa bill aayega or aana bhi chahie
 If the temple of Rama is not built on the birthplace of Rama, who will build it? isiilie saare santon ne or is bharat bhoomi ke ram bhakton ne yah sankalp vyakt kiya he ki ab ram mandir main ab or deree nahin hogi
 Baba Ramdev said, 'I think some good news can be received this year
 sansad loktantr main sarvopari he or sansad chaahegi to ramamandir kyon nahin banegaa
 'UP government said- Ram temple will definitely be built
 Before this, an important statement of the Uttar Pradesh government has come on the construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya
 rajya ke dipti siem keshav prasad maury ne kaha ki ram mandir par ham kuch nahin kar sakate hai kyonki ye maamla abhi adaalat main he
 Deputy CM said, 'it is not a matter of pressure or influence
 
 
 jo maamla court main he us par ham kuch nahin kah sakate hai
 
 
 But a grand temple will definitely be built on the birthplace of Ramlala in Ayodhya, we cannot tell when the date will be built
 
 
 ye hamaare haath main nahin he, ye court ke haath main he
 Keshav Prasad Maurya also said that now no one can build a building and memorial in the name of Babur on the birthplace of Ramlala
 is maamle main congress or samaajawaadee party par bhi hamalaa bolaa
 The deputy CM said that he would definitely like to know what Janaudhari Rahul Gandhi and Akhilesh Yadav, who had announced to build the temple of Lord Vishnu, would like to know about it
 keshav prasad maury ne kaha ki ayodhya main ram lalaa kii vishaal pratimaa lagane se koi nahin roak saktaa he
 The deputy CM said that no one can stop Ayodhya from developing
 bharat main nai sarkaar banane ke baad, kootneeti ke paryvekshak is baat ko lekar hameshaa se asamanjas main rahe hai ki pradhanmantri narendra modi kii kootnithik muhim main global trade kii charchaaen kyon nadaarad hai
 This silence was astonishing because by the time the new government arrived in Delhi, the ground for major changes in global trade diplomacy had been prepared, in which India had to make its place
 modi sarkaar kii chuppi, yadi ranneetik thi to ab tak iske nattejey aa jane chahie the lekin agar yah chook thi to yakeen maniye, badi chook rahi he
 Earlier this month, 12 countries in the Pacific Ocean signed the us-led Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP), which is not only the most modern and vast trade bloc, but also the beginning of a new round of global trade governance
 is
 bharat kaa tipipi kaa hissaa bananaa to dur, yah isaki paridhi par ho rahi charchaaon main bhi nahin he, jabaki bharat ko global trade main nae badlaavon kaa agua hona chahie tha
 India's activism about the WTO was surprising in the recent mobilization of African countries
 antarrashtriya vyapaar dhaancha banane main dablutio kii simit safalataa ke baad tipipi or asian, bharat va china kii bhagidaari vaali riginal comprihensive iconomic patarnership (aarasieepi) par charchaa shuru hui he
 Many African guests from India are also finding their place in these treaties, leaving the WTO behind
 aarasieepi par vaartaayen jari hai jabaki tipipi pehali sahmati ban chuki he
 The five-year exercise over the treaty has been considered the most intensive trade talks in recent history
 haalanki tipipi ko america congress va sadsy deshon kii sansadon kii manjuuri abhi milani he, phir bhi apane vartmaan swaroop main hi yah sandhi khaasi vyapak he
 Twelve countries (australia, Brunei, Chile, Canada, Japan, Singapore, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, America, Vietnam) included in the TPP cover 40% of the world's GDP and 26% of the trade
 china bhi jald hi iskaa hissaa banegaa
 On the other hand, the RCEP in which India is involved will also be affected by the TPP as many members of the RCEP are part of the TPP
 tipipi se bharat kii shuruaati duuri takneekee thi
 For its membership it is necessary to be a member of Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
 1998 se 2009 ke bich apek main nae sadasyon ko shaamil karne par pabandi thi
 Therefore, the door of the TPP was not opened, but from 2009 onwards India should have started to become active and part of this treaty
 khaas taur par pradhanmantri narendra modi ke global mishan main apek va tipipi main pravesh sabase upar hona chahie tha
 TPP is called by experts the Gold Standard Trade Pact, which takes free trade ahead of the old WTO and FTA arrangements
 tipipi ke tahat sadsy deshon main 98 fisadi seemaa shulk daren yani kareeb 18,000 tarriff lines khatm ho jaaengi
 Not just customs, TPP is agreeing on all the parties where the WTO had failed, including export of services, agriculture, intellectual property, foreign investment, environment, labor, e-commerce, competition, pharma
 tipipi se bharat kii duuri ke maddenjar arthvyavastha, vyapaar or global kootneeti main uske rasookh par asar ke akalan shuru ho gaye hai
 The free market created under this will change the balance of global trade, as the bulk of world trade will be under tpp's control after China's possible entry into the treaty
 peterson institute of international iconomi ke taaje adhyayan ke mutabik, yadi bharat isse baahar rahaa to desh ko kareeb 50 arab dollar ke niryaat kaa salanaa nuksaan hoga
 The treaty will also determine the trend of trade and foreign investment between governments
 bharat ke liye tipipi kaa doosraa asar or bhi gambhir he
 After GAT (ancestor of WTO), TPP is the first treaty that governments and private sector are so keen on
 tipipi ne abhi aadha rasta hi tay kiya he phir bhi isaki vaartaon kaa dhaancha global vyapaar prashasan ke nae paimaane tay kar rahaa he
 The countries involved will change their trade and customs policies in a new way, including RCEP with India's presence
 tipipi, bahurashtriya vyapaar kii nai global gavarnence kaa aadhaar hogi or kshetreey mukt vyapaar sandhiyon ke liye maanak ban jaaegi
 There is an eagerness in the diplomatic, industrial and diplomatic circles about TPP, while there is growing uneasiness in India
 europea samudaay ke saath mukt vyapaar sandhi par baatcheet rukne or asian, bharat va china kii aarasieepi par vaartaon ke gati na pakadaaey ke bich america kii aguai main tipipi par nirnaayak sahmati ne bharat ko vyapaar kootneeti main haashie par khadaa kar diya he
 India's exclusion from the mainstream of global trade makes the success of Modi's aggressive diplomatic campaigns suspicious
 khaas taur par tab jabaki antarrashtriya vyapaar se gujarat ke puraatan sambandhon ke kaaran, modi ke netritv main bharat kii vishwa vyapaar ranneetiyon or mukt bazaar main nae prayogon kii ummid thi
 Modi is starting a new phase of his diplomatic campaigns and on the other hand preparations are being made for mobilization of APEC economic leaders in Manila in November
 modi ko ab vyapaar kootneeti ko apane global abhiyaanon kaa aadhaar bananaa hoga, or apek ke jariye tipipi main bharat kaa pravesh sunishchit karnaa hoga, kyonki bharat kii kootnithik safalataa modi kii videshi reliyon se nahin balki global vyapaar kootneeti kii mukhyadhara main bharat kii vaapasi se maapi jaaegi
 Without this return there will be no return of foreign investment in India
 aarthik killat kaa saamana kar rahaa pakistan ab gadhe bechakar apni kuch mushkilen dur karegaa
 Pakistan ranks third in the world in terms of the largest population of donkeys
 vahiin china duniya kaa aisa desh he jahaan gadhon kii aabaadi sabase adhik he
 The population of donkeys in Pakistan is believed to be around 5 million
 isse pehle farvari main pakistan kii aarthik dikkaton ko dur karne ke liye china ne karodon rupee ke lone kii peshkash kii thi
 Now in return, Pakistan will send donkeys to China
 china main gadhon ko kaaphi khaas mana jaataa he kyonki inkaa istemaal paaramparik chini dawa banane main kiya jaataa he
 Gelatin prepared from donkey skin is said to have medicinal properties
 isse khun or immune system behatar hota he
 An official of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa said that Chinese companies are willing to invest in donkey farming in Pakistan
 media report ke mutabik, videshi companiyaan pakistan main 21 hajaar karod rupee invest kar sakati he
 To increase the country's exports, the live stock department has said that for the first time special donkey farms will be started in the country
 deraa ismayal khan or manasehara main videshi saajhedaari main farm shuru kiye ja rahe hai
 In the first three years, the government wants to export about 80 thousand donkeys
 usne peedit doctor ladki par tejaab dalwane se pehle usee syringe main pani bharwakar thik usee tarah apane upar dalwaaya, or jab vah is baat ko lekar aashwast ho gaya ki donon naaballig ladke tejaab ko acchhee tarah peedit ladki par daal aaenge, tab usne apane dost vaibhav ke jariye tejaab daalane vaale ladakon ko 25 hazaar rupee or 15 din kaa vakt diya
 
 
 Yes, this disclosure was made by Senior Resident Dr
 Ashok Yadav, accused of ESIC himself
 naaballigon ne pehle bike churaai, phir 17 disambar ko tejaab daalane ke liye ladi doctor kaa intjaar karne lage, lekin us din vah car se aspataal ja rahi thi, so, plan fail ho gaya
 
 
 The retry occurred on the morning of 21 December, when the aggrieved Lady Doctor was on her way to the hospital with her white scooty
 kaali pulsar motorcycle par savaar donon naaballigon ne skuti kaa peechha kiya, or mauka dekhakar tejaab se bhari syringe se peedita par acid daal diya, jisase ladi doctor kaa cheharaa jhulas gaya or dahini aankh kii roshni bachaane ke liye ames ke doctor ab ilaaj main jute hai
 On Thursday morning, the news came that the police caught four people who were impregnated
 police jaanch main pataa chalaa ki chaar main se do naaballig hai, jinhone chand paison ke laalach main pehle bike churaai phir ladi doctor par tejaab daalaa
 Although the victim girl was repeatedly saying that she did not suspect anyone, but when the police started making a list of her friends, it came to know that Dr
 Ashok Yadav, who lived in Mayapuri, had long been known to the lady doctor and her family members
 already knew
 lekin ladi doctor ko shaayad uske ekatarfa pyaar kaa pataa nahin tha
 When Ashok Yadav came to know that the marriage of the victim girl was going on with another, he decided to teach the victim a lesson inside
 is bare main jab usne kol centre main kaam karne vaale arne mitra vaibhav se baat kii to usne do naaballig ladakon ko is kaam ko anjaam dene ke liye taiyaar kar liya
 Who is Dr
 Ashok Yadav? 
 
 ? Dr
 Ashok Yadav was MBBS from Russia with about six feet length, fair complexion and innocent face
 pichley kareeb teen saal se vah iesaisi aspataal main senior resident ke rup main karyrat he, or peedit ladki se uski mulaakaat embibies ke vakt se hi he, lekin vah ekatarfa pyaar karata he, is baat kaa andaja peedita ko bhi nahin tha
 Due to this, when the police wanted to interrogate Dr
 Ashok Yadav, the victim girl protested saying that if Ashok was questioned, she would withdraw her case
 aaropee doctor ne yah puraa plan kareeb 20 din pehle taiyaar kiya tha
 On December 17, the minor boys also tried to throw acid on the victim
 , lekin us din vah car se aspataal ja rahi thi
 This incident is an example of how one-sided blind love turns blind blind, which makes even a doctor go crazy, and can hurt a girl for a lifetime

 At one time, the match was seen going completely into India's bag
 lekin aakhri ke 7 overon main match kaa rukh palat gaya or england team ne ek baar phir world cap par kabja kar liya
 There were 10 key turning points in this match, which led to the Indian team losing the winning bet
 1
 Recovering after the initial setback: Toss win The host team decided to bat first, but the Indian bowling's early success had somewhat put the brakes on the England team's fast start
 11 se 16 over ke bich main england team ko lagaataar teen jatke lage
 But after this, the Indian team had to struggle for the next wicket
 2
 Great partnership of Sarah Taylor and Natalie Skiver: After the setback in the 16th over, the England players tried to gain a foothold and the score started to run one by one, reaching 146 for England's 3 wickets in the scoreboard
 is bich sara tailor or natali skiver ke bich chauthe wicket ke liye 83 ran kii shandaar partnership ho gai
 But then in 33 overs the pair was broken by Jhulan Goswami
 haalanki 33wein over main hi bhartiya gendbaaji jhulan ne tailor (45) ko bhi sushamaa verma ke haathon kaich kara diya
 But by then more than 150 runs had been scored on the scoreboard
 3
 Jhulan's shock to England team: Jhulan gave two blows in two consecutive balls in the 33rd over to the Firangi team leading to a big score, first dismissing Sarah Taylor proving a headache for India and then new on the next ball Batsman walked Frenn Wilson from the crease
 lekin england team ek-ek ran bananaa jari rakhaa or phir kuch der baad england kii player khulkar shot lagane lageen, jisase sammanjanak score 228 ran bana
 And for India, these scores caused defeat, because at one time England's team was on the verge of collapsing within 200 runs
 4
 Fifties innings of Natalie Skiver: 83 runs partnership for the fourth wicket between Sarah Taylor and Natalie Skiver
 sara tailor ke out hone ke baad natali skiver khulkar khilne lageen or phir ye wicket lenaa bhartiya team ke liye jaruri ho gaya tha
 So 37 again
 1 overon main natali skiver kaa wicket gira
 But by then it had played a brilliant innings of (51) runs for its team
 ye wicket bhi jhulan goswami kii jholii main gayi
 5
 england ke scoreboard 228 ran:aakhri ke 10 overon main england kii team ne teji se ran banane kii koshish kii
 Katherine Brunt was scoring runs fast, however, in the 46th over, Katherine was run out by Dipti Sharma for 34 runs
 saatvaan wicket girane ke baad england kii team ne ran banane ke bajaay puure over khilne par apana focus kar diya, or phir ranneeti ke tahat ek-ek ran jutate hue score 228 ja pahunchaa
 6
 bharat ko shuruaati jhatka:228 ran kaa peechha karne utari bhartiya mahila team ko duusare hi over main smriti mandhana bina khaataa khole out ho gayi
 Due to which the pace that India team should have got in the opening could not be found
 7
 poonam-harmanpreet pair break: Harmanpreet Kaur and Poonam Raut carried the Indian innings forward after Smriti Mandhana's wicket fell
 donon ke bich tisare vikat ke liye 95 ranon kaa partnership hui, jisase kii sthiti ek vakt majboot najar aa rahi thi
 But in the meantime, the dismissal of Indian team Poonam Raut proved to be a big turning point for India's defeat
 8
 Mithali Raj does not stand at the crease: After Poonam Raut was dismissed for 85, the match was completely caught in India
 jiske baad mitali raaj 17 ran banaakar out ho gayi or phir england team se bhartiya team ke ran banane ke raftaar par brake laga diya
 After this Harmanpreet Kaur took the responsibility of scoring fast runs and then she scored a brilliant 51 runs
 lekin harmanpreet kaa achaanak wicket girnaa haar kii badi vajah rahi
 9
 lagaataar wicket girnaa:harmanpreet cor ke out hone ke baad team india kii raah aasaan lag rahi thi
 But after the 42nd over, four consecutive wickets fell one by one
 jisase bhartiya team baikfoot par aa gai
 After which the England team did not give the Indian team a chance to return, and the match got its fist which caused disappointment among the Indian fans
 10
 7 batsmen out for 28 runs: After the setback in the 42nd over, the Indian team could not recover
 england kii anyaa shrabsol ne 46 ran dekar 6 wicket jhatkar match bharat se chin liya
 The Indian team lost 7 wickets in making 28 runs of the last
 jiske baad puri team 219 ran par ol out ho gai
 And the Indian team lost the match by 9 runs and the World Cup dream was broken

 But the circle around them used to get them working
 kyonki vah nirdaleey netaa ke taur par mukhyamantri bane the or rajya sarkaar ke adhikari shaayad unhen puri jaankaree nahin dete honge
 Koda's team did not work under him

 On one side there are 18 lakh people of a city and on the other side a stray leopard, which has imprisoned the entire city in homes
 kya police, kya sena, kya van vibhaag or kya aam log, sabhi uski talash main hai
 But that is what shows a glimpse and then disappears
 ab sawaal yah he ki aakhir apana ghar chhodkar yah tendua insaanon kii basti main kyon or kaise aayaa? to aaie yah sach bhi jaan lijie
 
 
 Whenever someone went against the Nizam created by nature, then something similar happened
 kehete hai ki qudarat kabhi bhi kisi ko pareshaan nahin karti
 But this is just right as long as you don't tease it
 meerut ke daaman main khoff ke jo manzar idhar-udhar bikhare pade hai
 They are actually the result of incessant tampering with the nature for years
 koi khamosh rahe or kuch na kahe, to iskaa matlab yah nahin ki wo kamazor he
 But where did the greedy contractors know this
 lekin maan lijie ki agar unhen iskaa pataa bhi hota, to shaayad wo ise zaahir nahin karte, kyonki laalach unhen aisa karne nahin detii
 Overall, what has been happening in Meerut for the last 48 hours is the result of human negligence and greed in the last several years
 kareeb 35 lakh vaali puure meerut jile kii aabaadi kaa 51 fisadi hissaa pehle gaanv main basataa tha
 But in the name of promotion and urbanization, the forests were cut and prepared such a forest of cement and concrete that the same 51 percent of the population of the village also got up in the city
 jaahir he insaani gharon ko basaane ke chakkar main jangal main rahane vaale jaanavar apane hi ghar se beghar hote gaye
 The result is in front of us all
 aise jaanavar ab jab-tab bhatkar kar ham insaanon kii basti main chale aate hai
 This is where the Nizam of nature deteriorates, because nature created a separate settlement for humans and animals
 par ham insaanon ne jaanwaron kii basti par bhi kabja kar liya
 Those who are saying that this leopard, who lifted Meerut on the head, has come out of Jim Corbett, not because of the deforestation
 lekin wo ye nahin bataa paa rahe ki kareeb dedh sau kilometre kii duuri tay kar tendua meerut kaise aa saktaa he
 There were more settlements on the way, he would have stayed there
 zaahir he sachai ye nahin he, balki sach ye he ki ek puure shahar par haaavee ye khauf laaparvaah sarkari or saamaajik dohan kii vajah se haaavee he
 Every kind of shops have opened in these areas of Meerut in the name of development and urbanization in the last ten-twenty years
 manamaane tareeke se yahaan zamin kii kareed-farokht ho rahi he
 Indiscriminate buildings are being erected
 ye sab kuch ho rahaa he hariyaali or jangalon ko kuchalakar
 The result is in front
 jinaki basti insaanon ne chin lee, vahi jab ham insaanon kii basti main bhatakkar aa gaya to puraa shahar saham gaya he
 Well perhaps the people of Meerut could have got rid of the fear of leopards before, if the people of the forest department had done their work properly
 tendua lagbhag unki giraft main aa chukaa tha
 There was also an opportunity to use a tranquilizer to faint the leopard
 magar kamaal dekhie ki phir bhi tendua puri tarah se behosh nahin hua
 People are still armed with lathi-poles, and somewhere the soldiers with SLR rifles and AK 47s are looking for it
 khabar he ki tendua ab bhi shahar main chipa hua he
 But where, no one knows
 haa, aakhri khabar jo mili he, uske mutabik mangalvaar dopaher ko uske panjon ke nishaan puth gaanv main dekhe gaye hai
 After this news, the police-administration is now investigating the leopard in Puth village
 haalanki mangalvaar ko shahar ke skool-college khule
 But the fear was that the parents themselves stood at the school gate until the holiday was over
 tendue kii dehshat kaa andaja aap sirf isi se laga sakate hai ki kai jagah log kutton ko tendua samaj kar bhaag khadey hue
 Obviously, the people of Meerut will not be able to sleep peacefully until the leopard is caught

 Even before its inauguration, the Central Road Research Institute had written a letter that the entry of two-wheeler and three-wheelers should be completely banned on this expressway, but two-wheelers are running here defying the traffic rules

 The BJP leader tweeted today without naming anyone, the Union minister defending Tarun Tejpal, the founder and patron of Tehelka
 is maamle ko lekar congress or bhaajapa ek-duusare par aarope-pratyarope kar rahe hai
 Opposing Tejpal's demand for the matter to be handed over to the CBI, the BJP has said that by doing so, it is finding its way to the rescue as it is close to the ruling Congress at the Center

 BJP is enjoying it openly

 Senior opposition leader Venkaiah Naidu on Tuesday, while criticizing Tejpal's allegation of BJP collusion, had said, "did the bjp's soul go inside the Tehelka editor in the lift?" Right now, he is saying that instead of bjp-ruled Goa, his case should be pursued in some other state
 kal vah kahenge ki ise desh ke baahar le jaaya jaae, sanyukt raashtra main le jaaya jaae
 Tejpal has accused the Goa police of registering an FIR on sexual assault on a colleague as politically motivated, alleging that the chief minister of the state is taking undue interest in the case

 Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Wickramasinghe also visited India last month
 arthshaastra kii asankhya takneekee paribhaashaon ke pare koi aasaan matlab? praadhyaapak ne kaha, ummid or vishwaas
 Business, exchange, consumption, savings, debt, investment rests on the hope and confidence of a good future
 isi ummid kaa tham janaa yani bharose kaa simat janaa mandi he
 Consumption is based on the expectation of increasing income going forward
 karj apni vaapasi kii ummid par tikaa he; audyogic vyapaarik nivesh khapat badhane par kendrit he; or bachat yaa sheyaron kii kharid is ummid par tiki he ki yah chakra thik chalegaa
 To deal with the recession, the government made the budget head two months ago
 lekin ummiden nidhaal padi hai
 Can we measure the lack of expectation and confidence in statistics? It can be a measurement by looking deeply into the causes of recession that are being counted or the solutions being sought
 mandi kii pehali vajah bataai ja rahi he ki bazaar main puunji, paise yaa taralata kii kami he lekin
 
 
 • Cash in India (currency in circulation), 21 in the first week of July
 1 lakh karod rupye par thi jo pichley saal kii isi avadhi ke mukaable 13 fisadi zyada he
 On the other hand, the deposit rate in banks has fallen below ten percent since 2010
 • rigerv bank byaaj kii dar ek fisad se zyada gata chukaa he lekin karj lene vaale nahin hai
 That is, there is money in the market, people have money in their hands, banks are making loans cheaper but people are thinking even before buying biscuits, cars and houses etc
 are far away
 • america or china ke bich vyapaar yuddh (aayaat mahangaa karnaa) se to niryaat badhaane kaa mauka he
 The weak rupee is also favorable to the exporters but neither exports increase nor production
 • kharch chalaane ke liye sarkaar ne rigerv bank kaa rigerv nichod liya he to suzav die ja rahe hai ki jiesti kam hone se maang bad jaaegi
 But since implementation, the GST rate was reduced every six months
 na maang badi, na khapat, rajasav or buree tarah tut gaya
 • During the last five years, inflation has not stopped even once, yet savings and consumption have fallen
 haath main paisa hone ke baad bhi kharch na badhanaa, tex or keemten ghatane ke baad bhi maang na badhanaa, karj sasta hone ke baad bhi karj na uthanaa
 
 
 It is believed that those who have to spend or buy a house car by taking loans do not believe that their earnings will increase further
 jinhen udyog ke liye karj lenaa he unhen maang badhane kii ummid nahin he or jinhen karj dena he, unhen karj kii vaapasi na hone kaa dar he
 This complexity has triggered two vicious cycles
 tex kam hoga to ghaataa yani sarkaar kaa karj badhegaa
 Interest rates will rise, new taxes will be levied or petrol and diesel prices will rise
 agar bank karj or sasta karenge to diposit par bhi byaaj ghatega
 In this way banks will lose savings and capital will be less
 yahi vajah he ki yah mandi apane taaja purvajon se alag he
 In 2008 and 2012, the government poured money and cut taxes, which became a matter, but now it is difficult
 2015 ke baad se lagaataar sarkari kharch main ijapha hua he or jiesti ke chunavi asar ko kam karne ke liye tex main kami hui lekin phir bhi ham dhulak gaye
 No more resources left
 sarkari kharch ke liye rigerv bank ke rigerv ke istemaal se dar badhegaa or vishwaas kam hoga
 The simultaneous decline in the three of earnings, savings and consumption is the underlying cause of the recession
 logon ko aay badhane kii ummid nahin he
 a large middle class in the country is stuck in debt
 rojgaar na badhane ke kaaran gharon main ek kamaane vaale par ashriton kii sankhya bad rahi he
 This is the reason that savings (banks, small savings, houses) are at the lowest level of 20 years (30 percent of GDP)
 yah sab us kathith tej vikaas ke dauraan hua, jiske daawey beete paanch baras main hue
 If an economy does not generate employment or save on its best days, then the chances for the coming generation are reduced
 kya sarkaar ne apane pichley kaarykaal main tej vikaas ke jo aankade gadhe the un par kuch zyada hi bharosa kar liya? usee kii chamak main nivesh badhaane, sarkari dakhal kam karne, mukt vyapaar ke liye dhanchaagat sudhaar nahin kiye gaye jiske kaaran ham ek ziddee dhanchaagat mandi kii chapet main hai
 If this is true, then the need is for those reforms, not the packages that make the headlines because the recession of expectations is very stubborn

 Sombhai had said, 'our parents did not study much and our family was poor
 unke liye narendra modi anya kisi bachche kii tarah hi the
 In the same way, our parents got them married to Jashodaben at a young age, but it became a social formality only
 ’ modi ne vadodara loksabhaa seat se namakan daakhil karte samay apane halafname main pehali baar apane shaadishuda hone kaa ullekh kiya he or patni ke khaane main jashodaben kaa naam likhaa he

 sona kharidne waalon ke liye khushkhabari
 Its prices are falling and will fall further
 lagbhag das dinon main sone ke daam 10 pratishat tak gir chuke hai or isaki keemat chaar maheene ke nunatam str par ja pahunchi he
 It is said that the prices have fallen due to the removal of government restrictions and customers not interested in purchasing
 dhyaan rahe ki sone ke daam badhkar ek samay 35,074 rupee prati das gram ke str par chale gaye the
 Investors are currently investing in shares and dollars instead of gold
 itnaa hi nahin bazaar main mandi kii avadharana hone se bhi iske daam gire hai
 Yogesh Singhal, general secretary of The Bullion and Jewelers Association, said that gold prices may fall now but there are some conditions for this
 unhone bataaya ki nai sarkaar se logon ne kaaphi ummiden lagaai hai or iskaa bhi sone kii keemat par asar pad saktaa he
 He can also 'bounce back'
 He said that if conditions are favorable, gold can also go to the level of Rs 25,000 per ten grams but at present it is unlikely to go below Rs 26,500
 agar logon kii apekshaayen puri nahin hui to yah phir se 'bouns back' kar saktaa he or upar chadh jayega
 Sona prepared in the capital on Tuesday (
 999) 27,150 rupee par tha
 Singhal said that the price of gold is also falling due to rumors at this time
 iske alaava sarkaar ne export houseon ko bhi jo chhot di, usase bhi fark padaa he
 Prices have also fallen due to the decrease in premium on gold
 aane vaale samay main giravat dikh sakati he
 Gold will fall even if the rupee is strong
 Experts believe that there may be a significant fall in gold prices, but it is necessary that the government should reduce the custom duty on it from 10 percent to 2 percent
 iske alaava agar rupaya dollar ke mukaable or majboot hoga to bhi sona giregaa
 Not only this, they believe that if the government increases the limit of relief in income tax, then purchases in gold will increase and its prices will fall
 unka maananaa he ki aisi haalat main sona 22,000 rupee prati das gram tak ja saktaa he
 But there is every possibility that it will touch the level of Rs 25,000 once
 sarrapha bazaaron main kharidaar lautne lage hai or ve thodi bahut kharidari bhi karne lage hai
 Gold has increased in the last two days
 peepi jewelers ke partner pawan gupta ne kaha ki kharidari bad rahi he lekin agle do hafton main yah or badhegi kyonki tab tak sone ke daam ek sahi str par aa jaaenge
 That is, it will fall and gold will become cheaper in the true sense
 vaayada bazaar main bhi sone ke daam gire hai or use ummid he ki sone main giravat abhi jari rahegi
 Overall, the situation is such that the possibility of falling gold prices in the country at present

 ) The famous Muzaffarpur shelter home scandal of Bihar shook the entire nation
 is maamle kii jaanch main juty sibiai ne 73 pannon kii chargeshit court main daakhil kii he
 This charge sheet opened every single fold of the biggest rape case in Bihar, which included everyone from white-collar to influential people and politicians to officials
 in tamaam chehron ke peeche ek hi cheharaa tha
 And that was the face of Brajesh Thakur
 magar ye jaananaa zaruri he ki aakhir brajesh thakur tha koun
 Which had created so much penetration between the government and the ministers
 maamuli patrkaar se karodpati takamuzaffarpur shelter home rape cese kii vajah se aaropee brajesh thakur ko aaj puraa desh jaan chukaa he
 But the story of Brajesh, who looted crores of rupees from a minor journalist and started a business of crores, is a bit different and mysterious
 saalon se akhbaar chhapane or sarkari khajaane se karodon kaa vigyaapan vasuulne ke apane pushtaini kaarobaar kii aad main brajesh thakur haivaaniyat kii tamaam hadein paar karke masumi bacchiyon kii asmat kaa dhandha karne laga tha
 Under the nose of government administration and government, Brajesh Thakur was doing these black tricks
 or sab yaa to tamashbin bane hue the yaa uske is ghinaune khel ke kirdaar or hissedaar the yaa phir aankh band karke apni duniya main magan the
 But now that the truth of Brajesh Thakur's exploits is coming to light, it is being learned that in the shelter home of Brajesh Thakur, who is running government expenditure, the limits of humility were met with the girls
 siyasat main naakaam brajesh bana patrakaarshuruaati daur main raajnneeti main naakamayaabi mili
 But still the stars of Brajesh Thakur shone very fast
 thakur ne teen akhbaar shuru kiye jisamen angrezi or urdu kaa akhbaar bhi shaamil tha
 But he was handed over to his sons and daughters
 paanch saal pehle usne enjio kii duniya main kadam rakhaa or patrkaar hone kii vajah se sarkari theke or vigyaapan hathiyaakar mujffarpur or patna main apana varchasv bana liya
 Having fought elections twice, looking at the history of such a millionaire Brajesh Thakur, it is known that he contested from Muzaffarpur in 1995 and 2000 on the ticket of Gangster Anand Mohan's party 'bihar People Party'
 magar donon hi baar use haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 He then shifted his focus to his father's news paper 'suffix Lotus'
 apane dabadabe ke vajah se use kai sarkari vigyaapan milane lage
 It is believed that he had entered into relationships with the leaders of almost all the parties of Bihar
 sattadhishon ke darbar main apni pahunch ke dam par mujffarpur main apni hanak kaayam rakhi or kai tarah ke dhandhe main haath aajamaate hue karodon kii sampatti bana lee
 In 2013, Thakur started his NGO Seva Sankalp and Vikas Samiti and got a contract to run a child shelter home operated by the Bihar government in Muzaffarpur
 thakur ne jila bal kalyaan kamity ke saath mileebhagat kar liya jo child shelter home kaa surveykshan karti he
 At the same time, it tells where work is not being done properly
 sarkaar or prashasan main setting karne ke baad brajesh ne sarkari paise se hi shelter home chalaane kii aad main majaboor betiyon ke saath dushkarm karne-karaane kii sari hadein paar kerani shuru kar deen
 Every night there was a gathering of many leaders, ministers and senior officers of Mahfilsube
 kaha ja rahaa he ki in mehphilon main uske shelter home kii majaboor ladakiyon ke saath dushkarm kiya jaataa tha
 Then 32 of the 42 girls residing in the girl child have been confirmed to have been raped
 mantri ke pati kaa bhi shelter home main tha aana janaabalika grih kii bacchiyon ne apane bayaan main hunter vaale ankal yani brajesh thakur or moonch vaale ankal ke alaava jis tond vaale netaji kii baat kii he
 The name of Chandeshwar Varma, husband of Bihar's Social Welfare Minister Manju Verma, was coming out in it

 com / yq02wgaatd — Arvind Kejriwal (@arvindkejriwal) June 17, 2018 On Sunday afternoon, on the concern raised about the safety of IAS officers, Kejriwal said that your safety is our responsibility
 kejariwal ne twit kar kaha ki IAS afasar hamaare parivaar kaa hissaa hai
 Officers should return to work
 unki puri suraksha kii jaaegi
 Earlier, the IAS Association held a press conference against Kejriwal's dharna
 saath hi kejariwal ke aaropon ko khaarij karte hue daawa kiya kidilli main iees adhikari hadtaalpar nahin hai
 They are coming to office regularly and doing their work
 association ne kaha ki adhikari jin meeting main sef feel nahin karte hai, vahaan nahin jate hai
 Safety and self-respect comes first and rules are followed
 haal hi main chif secretary ke saath jo bartaav hua, usase adhikariyon kaa manobal gira he
 IAS Association Kimanisha Saxenane said that the news of the strike of IAS officers in Delhi is absolutely false and baseless
 ham sarkaar kii baithak main shaamil ho rahe hai
 All departments are doing their work
 hamamen se kuch adhikari to chhuttiyon main bhi kaam kar rahe hai
 He said, 'after what happened to the Chief Secretary, we are all afraid
 dar sirf IAS main hi nahin balki har sarkari afasar main he
 All officers and employees maintain a five-minute silence at lunch
 hamaara virodh pradarshan bas itnaa hi he or ham ise jari rakhenge
 He informed that the file for door to door delivery of ration in Delhi is not pending with the IAS
 iees association ne yah bhi sweekaar kiya ki adhikari routine meeting main nahin jate hai
 It was said on behalf of the association, we do not go to meetings where we do not feel safe
 suraksha or atmasamman sabase pehle aata he, niyam-kaayade baad main
 According to the association, women IAS officers demand security to attend the meeting
 lekin ham meeting kii gopneeyata ko dekhte hue surakshaguard ke saath nahin ja sakate hai
 The IAS Association said that having a camera in the meeting cannot guarantee security, there is a need to change thinking and behavior
 chif secretary ke saath jo hua uske baad sarkaar kii ore se koi hamatak nahin pahunchaa
 Chief Minister ensure our safety, this is our prayer
 iees adhikari varsha joshi ne kaha, 'ham dare hue hai or peedit mahasoos kar rahe hai
 We are being used for political reasons
 hamen hamaara kaam karne den
 After Kejriwal's appeal, it is expected that a major decision can be taken on Monday
 kendriya vittamantri arun jetali aaj sansad main saal 2018-19 kaa aam bajet pesh karne ja rahe hai, jo unki sarkaar kaa paanchvaan or shaayad sabase kathin bajet hoga
 In this, Jaitley will have to find solutions to the challenges of agricultural sector crisis, employment generation and economic growth, along with meeting fiscal targets
 yah bajet aise samay main pesh kiya ja rahaa he, jab aane vaale maheenon main aath rajyon main vidhansabha chunaav hone hai
 Three of these major states have Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) governments
 agle saal aam chunaav bhi hone hai
 If new rural schemes can come in the budget, there may also be an increase in allocation for existing programs like MNREGA, rural housing, irrigation projects and crop insurance
 gujarat chunaav se sabak lekar krishi ko protsaahit karne par dhyangujarat main haal hi main hue vidhansabha chunaav main dekhne ko mila ki bhaajapa kaa gramin vot bank chhitak rahaa he, jise dhyaan main rakhte hue jetali apane bajet main krishi kshetra ke liye kuch protsaahan bhi laa sakate hai
 Concessions can be found in the budget for small scale industries
 Similarly, there can also be concessions for small scale industries, as this section is seen as a major supporter of BJP
 jetali maal va seva kar (jiesti) ke karyanvayan se is varg ko hui dikkaton ko dur karne ke liye kuch kadamon kii ghoshnaa kar sakate hai
 Along with this, an effort can be made to provide some relief to the common man by increasing the income tax exemption limit
 rajmarg jaisi dhanchaagat pariyojnaon ke saath saath railway ke aadhunikeekaran ke liye adhik aavanton kiya ja saktaa he
 The challenge of reducing the budget deficit, along with the difficult challenge before Jaitley to remain on the path of reducing the budget deficit
 agar bharat is dagar se chukta he to vaishvik niveshkon va reating agenciyon kii nigaah main bharat kii saakh jokhim main aa sakati he
 Jaitley reduced the fiscal deficit to 3 in the current fiscal
 2 pratishat par laane kaa lakshya rakhaa tha
 It is to be reduced to three percent in the upcoming financial year 2018-19
 bajet ko lekar piem pehle hi de chuke hai sanketaisbajatko lekar badi apekshaayen nahin paalane kii naseehat pradhanmantri narendra modi pehle hi de chuke hai jabaki unhone sanket diya tha ki bajet main loklubhaavan kadamon par jor nahin hoga
 He had said, it is an illusion that the common man wants an exemption
 jiesti ke karyanvayan ke baad yah pehla aam bajet hoga jis par vishleshkon kii isliye bhi nigaah he kyonki ve dekhnaa chaahate hai ki jetali vruddhi ko bal dene ke liye kya kya upaay karenge
 Expected budget provision for startups There is a discussion that the capital gains from investment in shares may be tax-exempt
 yah bhi dekhnaa hoga ki kya jetali karporate kar main kami laane ke apane vaade ko puraa karte hai yaa nahin
 Experts say that while incentives may be announced to increase exports in some regions, some steps can be taken for startups ie new companies to boost entrepreneurship

 "according to Vatsala's father Vinay Singh, being an IAS, the family took a lot of dowry
 vinay singh ne kaha ki wo pratadit ho rahen hai or damaad ke iees hone ke kaaran unki koi nahin sun rahaa hai
 On the other hand, Jamui's DM Dharmendra has only to say that all the allegations against him are baseless

 According to the police of Diyala province, six people died there

 Diyala is one of the most turbulent regions of Iraq

 mayawati ji ne mere upar nishaanaa sadhakar sabit kar diya ki uttar pradesh main virodh kii raajnneeti main koi praasangik he to vah he sapa
 This is to say that of SP General Secretary Amar Singh
 india today ke sampadak prabhu chawla ne ajtak ke sidhi baat kaarykram main sapa ke mahasachiv amar singh se baat kii
 Major parts: Every two, three, four months, you definitely come in the headlines
 ab mayawati ne aapako diwaali kaa tohfa de diya
 By targeting me, Mayawati ji proved that if there is any relevance in the politics of protest in Uttar Pradesh, it is SP
 iske pehle hamaare netaa mulaayam singh yadav ke upar 170 jhuthe mukademe darj karaae gaye
 He also added Amitabh Bachchan
 ve itani badi industry ke iken hai, aakhir mayawati karnaa kya chaahati hai?raaj thakare se lekar mayawati tak sabhi jaanate hai ki amitabh bachchan kaa naam lene se ek apraasangik vyakti bhi yakaayak praasangik ho jaataa he
 Poor Amitabh Bachchan is not even in politics
 yah nai baat nahin he
 Where are you nowadays, are you in the UPA or are you against it? We are also supporting the same level of support which he had given in Mulayam Singh's Chief Minister in Uttar Pradesh
 lav-het relationships he?lav-het nahin, yah ek gunvattta vaala samarthan he
 If you will do good work, then you will give thanks
 agar acha kaam nahin karenge to prajatantr ke ek sajag prahari kii tarah kolahal machayenge
 Just three days ago, when Dimpleji's nomination was filed, on that day you said that today is the day of sacrificing the relationship between SP and Congress
 qurbaani ke taabut main ek or keel he
 You did not field candidates against Sonia and Rahul, but the Congress pitted such a person against the daughter-in-law of Mulayam Singh family, who left your party
 yah to dushmani he ki dam he to aa ja, dekh lenge
 There is no time for hot food in politics
 jeebh jalati he
 By winning Dimple, we will reply to the Congress for its approval
 aapaki putravadhu ko haraane ke liye wo puraa jor laga den, paise laga den, sarkaar laga den lekin amar singh or mulaayam singh sehate rahenge
 Endurance is too much in you
 hamaare hriday main kya jowar-bhaata he, vah hamaara hriday hi jaanata he
 That is, your relationship with the Congress is a sore throat
 aapke netaa mulaayam singh ji ne manmohan singh ji ko sabase kamjor pradhanmantri kaha
 Do you agree? We absolutely agree
 agar 100 main se number dene hon to sarkaar ko kitne number denge?main nijee taur par pradhanmantri ko kaaphi pyaar karata hum
 Will give a maximum of 36 numbers
 aapane unako third class paas kar diya, fail nahin kiya
 That is, do not make them fall

 This incident is in the summer of 1999
 27 varshiya priyanka gandhi apni maa, congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ke pehle loksabhaa chunaav prachaar ke liye amethi pahunchi thim
 During a media interaction, a reporter asked him what he had to say about the opposition's attack on his mother's foreign origin
 priyanka patrkaar ke najadik pahunchin or apana haath aage badhaakar poocha, ''kya aapako meri ragon main videshi khun daudta dikhataa he?"yah priyanka ke rajnatik rup se chatur dimag kaa pehla sanket tha, jis par congress ne do dashak baad bharosa kiya he
 The party has bet on Priyanka to make her fortune in the state of Uttar Pradesh (UP) where the 543-member Lok Sabha has the highest number of members
 2014 main, congress ne upi kii 80 main se sirf do loksabhaa siten jeetin or jeetne vaale donon hi nehru-gandhi parivaar ke sadsy the—raibareli main sonia gandhi or amethi main rahul gandhi
 Priyanka's formal entry into politics as in-charge of eastern UP has not only revived the state Congress, but has also suddenly changed the electoral landscape of 2019
 upi, jo aksar tay karata he ki dilli main sarkaar kiski banegi, vahaan bhaajapa or samaajawaadee party (sapa)-bahujan samaaj party (basapa) gathbandhan ke alaava priyanka ke netritv main teesri takat ke rup main ubhar rahi congress ke bich, kaante kii trikoniya takkar hone kii ummid he
 Former Union Minister Jitin Prasad says, "he is a game-changer
" unke aane se congress kaaryakartaaon main nai jaan aa gai he, jise saaf dekha ja saktaa he
 "the morale of the party has definitely increased and many activists are demanding that Priyanka contest the general election from Varanasi and directly challenge Prime Minister Narendra Modi in her own constituency
 haalanki priyanka kii ab tak chunavi raajnneeti main pariksha nahin hui he, lekin congress kaaryakartaaon kaa priyanka ke liye yah abhootpurv utsaah puri tarah se nirarthak nahin he
 In 1999, Arun Nehru — Rajiv Gandhi's brother-in-law and a member of his cabinet — also resigned from the Congress after pledging and contested the Lok Sabha elections against Sonia on a BJP ticket
 priyanka ne tab sirf ek sabha ko sambodhit kiya or ek aisi baat kahi jiskaa logon par gaharaa asar hua, ''aapane is kshetra main mere parivaar ke saath vishwasghaat karne vaale vyakti ko chunaav main aane kaise diya? us shaks ne congress main hone ke baavjood sampradayik takaton se haath milaayaa or apane bhai kii peeth main chura ghonpa
 "this was the end of Arun Nehru's political career
 magar ab halaat badal chuke hai
 Two decades later, it is a litmus test for Priyanka as she will challenge the combined capacity of both Prime Minister Modi and UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, as in-charge of eastern Uttar Pradesh
 darasal, pradhanmantri kii seat varanasi or yogi kaa garh gorakhpur bhi purvi uttar pradesh main hi padataa he
 This is the reason why Priyanka, a graduate of Psychology from Jesus & Mary College, Delhi - has been given charge of this field just 100 days before the election
 purvi upi main avadh, purvanchal or nichle doaab shaamil hai or yahaan se 40 loksabhaa siten hai
 In 2009, when the Congress won 21 seats from UP, after 1984, the party got the maximum seats from this state
 in 21 main se 18 siten purvi uttar pradesh se thim
 Significantly, the party's performance in the 2014 elections was the worst, still 17 in Awadh
 8 pratishat vot mili the
 The region has a large vote bank of Sarvans, mainly Brahmins, who have once been the base vote of the Congress
 priyanka ke aane ke baad congress ko bhaajapa se apana purana vot bank waapas milane kii ummid dikh rahi he
 There will be vigorous efforts to show Priyanka's Hindu identity to attract votes from the Brahmin community, which has a 13 per cent population and is reportedly being said to be angry with the BJP at present for several reasons
 kaha ja rahaa he ki brahman samudaay vibhinn vajahon se modi sarkaar se kuch khafa chal rahaa he
 The Supreme Court had given some concession in the 'strict' provisions of the SC / ST (prevention of Atrocities) Act, but the Modi government reversed the Supreme Court's decision
 iske alaava rajya prashasan main thakur samudaay kaa prabhaav bahut badha he
 Brahmins are angry for such reasons
 bhai rahul ke saath kumbh meley main ganga main dubkee lagane ke baad, priyanka 4 farvari ko purvi upi ke mahasachiv ke rup main apane rajnatik jivan kii shuruyaat kar sakati hai
 a Rajya Sabha MP from Congress says, "the upper caste voters are angry with the saffron party, but they are also not ready to support the SP-BSP alliance
" " upi kii aabaadi main lagbhag 40 pratishat hissaa pichde varg kaa he, jabaki daliton kii sankhya 22 pratishat he
 Data from the Center for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS) show that the Congress performed well in UP in 2009 because the party has held Kurmis, Brahmins, other upper castes, Muslims and non-jatav Dalits since the 2007 assembly elections
 And his vote share in Jat vote bank was increased considerably
 2014 main bhaajapa ne congress ke haath se savarna or kurmi vot chin liye to musalmaan vot sapa kii ore chale gaye the
 The party remained the second choice of Brahmins and non-thakur upper caste voters
 priyanka ko kurmiyon, brahmanon or gaiyr-thakur savarnon kaa samarthan phir se hasil karnaa hoga
 Traders and businessmen played a key role in bjp's success in 2014 and 2017, but many of them are angry with BJP due to demonetisation and Goods and Services Tax (GST)
 kisaanon se bhi bhaajapa kii duuri badi he or congress ise bhunaane kii koshish main he
 Rahul made the agrarian crisis one of the major themes of his election campaign against the Modi government
 upi ke kisaan bujadkhaanon par nakel kasne ke kaaran yogi sarkaar se vishesh rup se naakhush hai, kyonki sarkaar kii ore se sanchalit bujadkaane anutpaadak gaayon kii badhati sankhya se nipatane main vifal rahe hai or isse kisaanon par atirikt vittiya boj padaa he, saath hi unki fasalein bhi kharaab ho rahi hai
 That is, resentment is widespread
 jatigat guna-bhaag ke alaava 47 varshiya priyanka kii yuvaaon or mahilaon ke bich ek sidhi apil hogi
 In the 2014 election, the BJP benefited greatly from the support of young voters
 18-22 varsh aayu varg ke 51 pratishat matadaataaon ne party ko vot diya tha
 The importance of the women's vote can be understood from the fact that in the last two assembly elections, the voting percentage of women has been higher than men
 kaaryakartaaon main utsaah ke baavjood, rahul ko aagaamee aam chunaav main kisi bade chunavi phaayde kii ummid nahin he
 That is why they are insisting that Priyanka's appointment is not a short-term strategy of the Congress, but the beginning of the party's grand revival plan ahead of the 2022 UP Assembly elections
 sakriy raajnneeti main priyanka ke pravesh kii timming kaa dhyaan rakhaa gaya
 Three months after the Congress won three Hindipatti states, the Congress has fielded them at the election time
 yadi rahul kii aguai kisi badi jeet ke bina priyanka ko utaara jaataa to ise rahul ke netritv kii vifaltaa ke rup main dekha jaataa
 The Congress president is more active than Modi on social media
 haalia india today ke desh kaa mizaaj survey main saamne aayaa he ki rafel saude ko lekar sarkaar par rahul ke aaropon ne logon kaa dhyaan aakarshith kiya he
 However, Priyanka has always been the political advisor to her mother and brother
 raajnneeti main unki saarvajanik bhagidaari amethi or raibareli tak hi simit rahi ho, par ve congress ke kai bade faislon main pratyaksh yaa paroksh rup se shaamil rahi hai
 In December 2018, she was present to help Rahul in the meetings to decide the names of Chief Ministers of Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh
 2017 main priyanka kii vajah se upi vidhansabha chunaav ke liye congress-sapa main gathbandhan kaayam ho paaya tha
 "she knows how to connect with people of different priorities and stature," says a political strategist
 " ek varisht congress netaa us protocol kii ore ishaara karte hai jise priyanka ne hameshaa banaae rakhaa he, ''ve kabhi bhi kisi netaa ko—chaahe vah bada ho chota—apane ghar par talab nahin karatin
 She either goes to her house herself or meets him at her brother and mother's house
 "upi main akele ladgaye ke congress ke faisle ke baad priyanka card jaruri ho gaya tha
 Many Congress leaders had told Rahul that it would be fatal for the party to enter the election like a junior partner with 10 Lok Sabha seats in the SP-BSP alliance
 isliye party 2019 main narendra modi kii aguai vaali bhaajapa ke khilaaf ekajute vipaksh kaa hissaa rahete hue bhi gathbandhan se dur rahi
 But to lead an ambitious election campaign in the state, the party needed a strong leader who went beyond factionalism
 priyanka is kasuti par puri tarah se feet baithti hai
 Like other members of her family, she does not bear the burden of the past and she can reach even those who have been away from the family
 rahul ke vipareet, ve zyaadaatar netaaon ke saath esemes yaa phone par sampark main rahati hai
 "in UP, Priyanka was in constant touch with two such veterans and got her party work done, which did not have a good rapport with Sonia and Rahul," says a Congress general secretary
 " is baat ko maanane main unhone jaraa bhi hichak nahin dikhaai ki superstar amitabh bachchan kii maa teji bachchan se bachapan main mili tution kaa nateeja he ki ve itani acchhee hindi bol or samaj leti hai
 In 2013, his son Rehan set fire to the funeral pyre of Arun Nehru, whom Priyanka had declared as a traitor in 1999
 andruni sutron ke mutabik, buddha dharm main unki gahari ruchi or vipashyana ke niyamit abhyaas ne unhen na keval ek aisi shaks balki ek aise gambhir raajnneetik ke rup main bhi viksit kiya he, jiske dimag main hameshaa badi tasviir rahati he
 Priyanka specializes in connecting with the public instantly and naturally
 modi bhi is maamle main bahut dhani hai
 Many Congress supporters see the charisma and vitality of his grandmother Indira Gandhi in Priyanka and hope to capitalize on this charisma against Modi
 ve dharapravaah hindi bolti hai or bich-bich main avadhi bhi bol padati hai
 Although he is constantly compared to Bhai Rahul, most analysts believe that Priyanka is more comfortable
 unhone hameshaa is baat kaa dhyaan rakhaa he ki saarvajanik jivan main ve kabhi bhi bhai ko pachhadti na dikhen or unhone hameshaa apni daadi kii viraasat ko bhai ke saath saajha karne kii pravriti hi dikhaai he
 He had said, "his brother's understanding of politics is really very good and i think his quality came from my grandmother
" "ek shandaar rajnatik parivaar kii hone se unamem raajnneeti kii ek swaabhaavik samaj he
 But this political legacy of Priyanka will also become a weapon in the hands of the BJP
 upi main bhaajapa ke jin do diggajon—modi or yogi se priyanka kii sidhi takkar hogi, ve donon hi saamaanya pariwaron se taalluk rakhte hai
 The BJP will try to create an edge by comparing the backgrounds of both its veterans with Priyanka's privileged background
 soshal media par chale rahe abhiyaanon ne to pehle hi aisa dikhaanaa shuru kar diya he
 Although political rivals have so far been subjected to personal attacks on him, his formal entry into politics has opened many doors
 bhaajapa saansad subrahmanyam swami ne apane kutiltapurna andaaj main kaha, ''ve bypolarity dysorder se grast hai
 They beat people
 unki beemaari unhen saarvajanik jivan ke liye upyukt nahin banaati
 The public has to be vigilant not to know when they lose their mental balance
 " bhaajapa netaa kailash vijayawargeey ne kaha ki majboot netaaon kii kami ke kaaran congress ko ab ''chocolati" chehron kaa sahaara lenaa pad rahaa he
 Bihar minister Vinod Narayan Jha said that Congress can no longer get votes by showing beautiful faces
 jha ne yah bhi bataaya ki priyanka robert wadra kii patni hai jo ''bhrashtachar ke kai maamalon main aaropee" hai
 This is a big burden that Priyanka can feel herself buried
 unke vyavsaayee pati wadra skool ke jamaane se unke mitra rahe hai, jinase priyanka ne 1997 main 10, janpath main ek sade samaaroh main hindu reeti-rivaajon se shaadi kii thi
 Robert Vadra is facing CBI and ED investigations in nearly two dozen cases related to land acquisition and money laundering
 dilli main 35, lodhi estate main rahane vaale is dampati kaa ek 18 saal kaa betaa rehaan or ek 16 saal kii beti miraya he
 Vadra's father Rajendra had a business of exporting brass utensils in the city of Moradabad in western UP
 robert, unke bhai richard or bahan mishael ne apana adhikansh bachapan dilli main bitaayaa, jahaan unki maa morin ek skool main padhaati thim
 Mitchell died in a road accident in 2001, causing a family of grief
 richard ne 2003 main aatmahatya kar lee or rajendra ko 2009 main dilli ke ek guestaouse main faansee par jhulata paaya gaya
 The Congress has always called the allegations against Vadra a political vendetta of the BJP
 party yah kahati rahi he ki centre or kai rajyon main bhaajapa kii sarkarein hone ke baavjood pichley paanch varshon main bhaajapa wadra ke khilaaf ek bhi aarope sabit nahin kar pai he
 However, given the past record, it will be difficult to win in the political battle against Priyanka
 ve eent kaa jawaab pathar se dena jaanati hai
 In 2014, when Modi claimed that the Congress had become old, Priyanka quipped in a rally, "do i look old to you?" Was
 modi ne congress kaa namakaran aresavipi—rahul, sonia, wadra or priyanka—or abisidi—adarsh ghotaalaa, boforce ghotaalaa, koyala ghotaalaa or damaad kaa ghotaalaa—ke rup main karte hue kataaksh kiya tha
 Priyanka had retorted and said, "you have not come to teach in any primary school
 aap raashtra ko sambodhit kar rahe hai
 So do not teach English alphabet like RSVP or ABCD to the public
 "modi or bhaajapa, varnmaala to nahin padhaayenge, lekin nishchit rup se unki najar un jatigat samikarnon par kendrit rahegi jisane 2014 or 2017 main party ko rajya main safalataa dilaai thi
 Both of those bjp's successes were the result of rigorous social engineering
 ucch jatiyon (brahmanon or thakuron) ke saath gaiyr-yadav obisi varg or gaiyr-jatav daliton tathaa kisaanon se mili samarthan ne uski jeet kii ibaarat likhi thi
 The BJP would like to repeat this caste equation again
 party ne ucch jatiyon main aakrosh ko pahachaanaa or uskaa maananaa he ki aarthik rup se pichhadi ucch jati ke logon ke liye 10 pratishat aarakshan kii uski ghoshnaa se use laabh milegaa
 BJP will try to raise all the castes under a big Hindu umbrella by increasing its activism on the Ram temple issue
 rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (aresas) pichley saal se is mudde par jor de rahaa he or sakriy he
 The RSS appointed its representatives for all 71 Lok Sabha seats won by the BJP and took account of the performance of the local mps
 lekin yogi sarkaar ke prati party kaaryakartaaon kii naaraazgi bhaajapa kaa nayaa sirdard he
 The result of the increased dissatisfaction of the activists towards the Yogi government was that BJP national president Amit Shah, who arrived in Lucknow on October 24 last year, asked all the ministers to present their report card to the party's organization minister
