110 karod log is skim se baahar kyon kiye gaye hai
 We will ask Guruswami on what basis they say that under Atal Pension Yojana you will get the same money after sixty years that you have deposited
 yahi nahin jitne log beemaa lenge usamen marane waalon kii sankhya bahut kam hogi
 More people will be saved
 aise main premium raashi bainkon kii jeb main chali jaaegi
 You have to see what the death rate is when it is 50 years or 60 years
 jo bhi he aisi nitiyon ke bare main charchaa honi chahie jisase zyaadaatar logon kaa bhavishya judaa he
 Only the youth between the age of 18 to 40 years will be eligible for this insurance, whose benefits will be given when they are 60 years old
 iske liye saath saal tak har maheene 42 rupee se lekar 1452 rupee dene honge
 On this basis, the amount of pension will be fixed from one thousand to five thousand
 iske liye aapako khate main bachat kerani hogi or nahin bhar paye to sarkaar bhar degi
 But the government will provide special help only till 31 December
 aalochana yah he ki yah yojana 18 se 50 saal ke logon ke liye hi hai
 Why people from beyond 50 years were excluded
 senior citigen bhi shaamil nahin hai
 The Prime Minister said that a thousand rupees is being given to everyone for the pension scheme for the poor
 congress kahati he ki bharat sarkaar ne aam aadmi beemaa yojana, rajeev gandhi shilpi swasthya yojana or rashtriya swasthya yojana kii hi packaging kar di he
 Under the Rajiv Gandhi Shilpi Health Insurance Scheme, the craftsman, his wife and two children were given insurance cover
 janm ke din se 80 saal kii umr tak iske daayre main the
 The government will pay a premium of 697 and 797 rupees every year and craftsman will give 100 rupees every year on his behalf
 desh ke kisi bhi astpal main koi bhi medical ilaaj karaayaa ja saktaa tha
 The comments ab yah dekhnaa hoga ki in yojanaon kii sthiti kya he
 Another scheme for people below poverty line was National Health Insurance Scheme which is running
 hamaare mehmaan mohan gurusvaami ne likhaa he ki modi sarkaar ne jo teen yojanaayen launch kii hai unamem se kisi main bhi sarkaar apni taraf se ek paisa nahin degi
 Everyone has to give it to the public and the name will go to the government
 unki daleel he ki in yojanaon kaa laabh usee ko milegaa jiske paas bank khaataa he
 In a country with a population of 120 crores, only 150 million people have bank accounts
 110 karod log is skim se baahar kyon kiye gaye hai

 You have to see what the death rate is when it is 50 years or 60 years
 jo bhi he aisi nitiyon ke bare main charchaa honi chahie jisase zyaadaatar logon kaa bhavishya judaa he
 The criticism is that this scheme is only for people between 18 and 50 years old
 50 saal se paar ke logon ko kyon baahar kar diya gaya
 Senior citizens are also not included
 pradhanmantri ne kaha ki garibon ke liye jo pension yojana he uske liye sabko ek hazaar rupaya diya ja rahaa he
 The Congress says that the Government of India has packaging the Aam Aadmi Bima Yojana, Rajiv Gandhi Shilpi Swasthya Yojana and National Health Scheme
 rajeev gandhi shilpi swasthya beemaa yojana ke tahat shilpkaar, uski patni or do bacchon ko beemaa cover diya gaya tha
 From the day of birth till the age of 80 years were within its scope
 697 or 797 rupee premium sarkaar degi har saal or shilpkaar apni taraf se degaa 100 rupee har saal
 Any medical treatment could be done in any hospital in the country
 tippaniyan Now it has to be seen what is the status of these schemes
 garibi rekha se neeche ke logon ke liye ek or yojana ai thi rashtriya swasthya beemaa yojana jo chal rahi he
 Our guest Mohan Guruswamy has written that in none of the three schemes launched by the Modi government, the government will not give a single penny on its behalf
 sab janata ko dena hoga or naam sarkaar kaa hoga
 He argues that only those who have bank accounts will get the benefit of these schemes
 120 karod kii aabaadi vaale desh main 15 karod logon ke hi bank khate hai
 Why 110 crore people have been excluded from this scheme
 gurusvaami se ham puuchhenge ki ve kis aadhaar par kehete hai ki atal pension yojana ke tahat vahi paisa aapako saath saal baad milegaa jo aapane jamaa kiya he
 Not only this, the number of people who take insurance will be very less
 zyada tar log batch jaaenge
 In such a situation, the premium amount will go in the pocket of banks
 aapako dekhnaa hoga ki 50 saal yaa 60 saal hone par mrityu dar kya he
 Whatever it is, there should be discussion about such policies to which the future of most people is connected
 ab yah dekhnaa hoga ki in yojanaon kii sthiti kya he

 Union Water Resources Minister Uma Bharti has been angered by a statement by yoga guru Baba Ramdev
 beete dinon landan main ek tivi channel ko intervyuu ke dauraan baba ramdev ne ganga kii safai par asantosh jataate hue nitin gadakari kii tarif kii thi
 During that time, comparing the works of the two ministers, he said that the Ganges is still polluted
 baba ramdev ne kaha ki ganga par kaam to hua he, lekin utana nahin jitna hona chahie
 Baba Ramdev has said the same thing to Uma Bharti
 unhone ab is maamle par chuppi todate hue baba ramdev ko baqayda ek patr likhaa he
 In it, he wrote that Nitinji has been a participant in this scheme from the very beginning
 ab ve meri bhi bhagidaari sunishchit karte hai
 He had a role in what happened earlier on Ganga, now i have a role in what is happening
 isamen tulana nahin ho sakati
 Earlier there was a stage of planning and now there is a stage of execution
 2019 tak ganga ke sambandh main pradhanmantri ji sankalp puraa kar denge
 In the letter, Uma Bharti also said that inside these subjects, information cannot be available to anyone other than the Prime Minister, Nitin Gadkari and me
 lihaaja is bare main baahar nikali jaankaree bhraamak ho sakati he
 Uma Bharti said that i am satisfied with the work done on Ganga
 nitin gadakari bhi isaki prashansa karte hai
 Uma said that i found it strange to compare the two ministers while you are discussing the Ganges
 main swayan bhi nitin gadakari ji kii prashansak hum
 i also take pride in working in their company
 uma bharti ne kaha ki puri duniya ke saamne landan se ek tivi channel par mere bare main charchaa karte samay shaayad yah aapako dhyaan nahin rahaa ki aap mujhe nijee taur par aahat or mere atmasamman par aghat kar rahe hai
 Further in the letter, he said that since the age of eight, in these 50 years, hard work, ideology and nationalism is my strength
 yahi meri vishwavasaneeyata ke aadhaar rahe
 This gave me a fair place in the politics of the country, in the BJP and in the organization
 chaalaaki, chapalusee or sajeesh mujhe aati nahin
 Without it, my work went on and will go on
 uma ne baba ramdev ko apana maardarshak bataate hue unhen yaad dilaayaa ki aapke munh se niklaa koi bhi jumala mujhe haani pahunchaa saktaa he
 At the end of the letter, he also said that my life has been linked with Ganga
 apni jaan par khelkar bhigangaka kaary karke rahuungi or river linking yojana ko bhi lagu karwaakar rahuungi
 i have a spiritual brotherly relationship with Pujya @ umasribharti ji
 unke sammaan ko aahat karne kii meri koi manshaa nahin thi
 My aim was to point out to him the initial and administrative difficulties faced by Ganga on his action plan
 unki ganga-nishtha, dharm-nishtha or raashtra-nishtha prashansaneey havepiche

 Baba tweeted that i have a spiritual brotherly relationship with Uma Bharti

 My aim was to point out to him the initial and administrative difficulties faced by Ganga on his action plan
 unki ganga-nishtha, dharm-nishtha or raashtra-nishtha prashansaneey he
 It is worth noting that in a conversation with a TV channel in London, Yoguru Ramdev had said in response to a question regarding the Ganga cleanliness program that Uma ji's file gets stuck in the office while Gadkari ji's file does not get stuck
 unhone kaha tha ki desh main sabase zyada kisi mantri kaa kaam dikhataa he to vah nitin gadakari kaa he

 According to the reply received from RTI, Shastri 12 on 10 January 1966
 30 baje tak bilkul thik the

 doctor arain chag ne paaya ki shastri kii saansen tej chal rahi thim or wo apane bed par chaati ko pakadakar baithe the

 32 baje shastri kii maut ho gai
 The RTI activist questioned why the investigation report of former PM Shastri's death was not made public, why it was kept secret
 jabaki, shastri kaa parivaar bhi iske bare main jaananaa chahta he
 Even his grandson demanded it to know the cause of death
 unki maut ke baad unki patni lalitha shastri ne daawa kiya ki unke pati ko jehar dekar maaraa gaya
 His son Sunil Shastri questioned that his father had blue marks on his body

 32 baje achaanak maut ho gai
 However, it has been officially said that he died of a heart attack
 shastri ko hday sambandhi beemaari pehle se thi or 1959 main unhen ek heart atake aayaa bhi tha
 After this, his family and friends used to advise him to do less work
 lekin 9 june, 1964 ko desh kaa pradhanmantri banane ke baad un par kaam kaa dabaav badhata hi chalaa gaya

 ) The film 'bhoomi' is the story of a father and daughter who are happy in their lives
 sanjay dutt kii beti bhoomi yani aditi raav hydari kii shaadi hone vaali he magar shaadi se thik pehle bhumi ke ek puraane ashiq ne, jo ekatarfa pyaar karata tha, apane saathiyon ke saath milakar uskaa balaatkaar karata he
 Their suffering and struggle starts from here
 is film main baap beti ke rishton ko achche se darshaya gaya he
 The film shows that if a girl rejects one-way love of a boy, then to what extent does she have to face the consequences due to the boy's whims
 kis tarah ek sarphira aashiq ek hansatii khelti ladki kii zindagi barbaad kar detaa he
 The film also shows how society rejects the rape victim
 film ke kai seen dil ko choote hai
 The father's character is played by Sanjay Dutt and a father's pain is visible on the screen, but Aditi Rao Hydari has won the heart
 balaatkaar peedit kaa dard behtareen tareeke se darshaya he
 The theme of this film by director Omung Kumar is good because these days talk of Beti Bachao Beti Badhao is happening but the script of the film is very weak
 film main bahut zayaada dramebaazi he jo aaj ke darshakon ko pasand nahin aati
 The length of the film is more, which makes it boring at some places
 film main kai seen aise hai jo ham darjanon baar dekh chuke hai yani patakatha main bilkul bhi nayaapan nahin he
 This is Sanjay Dutt's first film after his release from jail, but the question arises that is the selection of this film right for his return? Depending on the subject, it is probably right because the issue of rape is very present at the moment and Sanjay Dutt is quite suitable in his character
 unhone is bhoomika ko achche se nibhaayaa he magar kahani ke taur par shaayad nahin kyonki vahi kamjor he
 So my rating for this film is 2 stars

 soshal media par data li ko lekar koharaam machaa he
 The data from Cambridge Analytica shocked everyone from Washington to New Delhi due to data leak allegations
 bharat main bhi bahes chhid gai ki soshal media par aapkaa data kitna mahfuj he
 But in the midst of this uproar of data leaks, let's first understand what data is? According to social media technology expert Javed Ahmed, every information you provide through any medium on mobile phone application, internet or social media is the same data
 is data main aapke apane phone number se aapke mobile main seve aapke jaankaron ke contact number lekar aap kahaan jate hai, kya karte hai, aisi har jaankaree ho sakati he
 But the problem of data leaks is not as serious as the information we are going to tell you about the data
 soshal media se li ho rahaa data darasal talab kii choti machhlee jaisaa he
 What has been revealed in Aaj Tak's ground investment will surprise you
 kya aapako andaja bhi he ki aap se judi har jaankaree bazaar main gum rahe saudagaron ke haath main he or mahaj 5-5 hajaar rupye main bik rahi he
 When Aaj Tak contacted these merchants of data to reveal this truth, they started bargaining themselves
 ajtak kii team ne jab isi tarah ke ek data saudagar se sampark karne kii koshish kii t thodi hi der baad hamen data bechney vaali ek company kii mahila pratinidhi kaa kol aayaa
 Aaj Tak's journalist, who is being contacted as an agent of the cosmetic company, asked the representative of the data dealer company a database of 5 xxrep 4 0 people in Delhi and Mumbai, asking for the details of the person's name, occupation, earnings and age
 5000 rupee main ek lakh logon kaa datadata saudagar company kii mahila pratinidhi hamen 5000 rupee main ek lakh logon kaa data dene ko taiyaar ho gai
 Not only this, he neither laid any condition nor any limit for this
 yah company hamen mahilaon se judaa data dene ko bhi taiyaar ho gai
 Apart from this, she also agreed to send advertisements related to the products of our cosmetics company to the mobile numbers of all these people through different mediums
 bas har cheez kaa rate tay tha
 Similarly, we talked to an agent of another company based in Mumbai
 yah agent bhi hamen dilli or mumbai main ek lakh logon kaa data mahaj 5-7 hajaar rupee main bechney ke liye taiyaar ho gaya
 The agent even said that if i want, i can give 18% GST and if i do not, GST can be avoided
 jaahir he ek tasviir dikhaati he ki kaise data bechney vaali companiyaan ab choti moti machhlee nahin balki bade magaramachhon kii tarah sauda kar rahi hai
 The most interesting thing is that now you do not even need to meet anyone to buy any data
 sara saudamobile par ghar baitheho jaataa he
 You order a quotation, transfer the money to their account and the data of millions of people on your email will be reached in a pinch
 isi data kaa istemaal soshal media par bhi hota he
 This gives a picture of how social media has become completely commercial
 soshal media par vyapaaree bhi apane utpaada bech saktaa he or rajaneta apana agenda bhi
 These data merchants are sitting in the market to meet every need of such people
 naam na bataane kii shart par ek soshal media management company ke managing diarector ne hamen bataaya ki unke paas bhi is tarah ke data maujuud hai, jo khuleam bazaar main bikate hai or jiskaa istemaal vah samaaj ke har tabake ke liye kar sakate hai
 According to the person, Bollywood insurance companies including bike insurance companies, political parties, politicians try to reach out to such publicized people
 ajtak kii ground report main yah puri tarah saaf ho gaya ki soshal media kii duniya main kuch bhi muft nahin he, or agar aapako kuch muft mil rahaa he to darasal is data kii duniya main aap hi product hai

 sibiai ko mili sajild diary main dhruv ke saath jaahida ke yon sambandhon, ek sidi recording, istemaal ho chuke condom jo plasticon kii theliyon main sambhalakar rakhe hue the or jin par unke istemaal kii taarikh bhi likhi thi, or plastic kii hi thili main rakhe baalo kaa ek guchha mila
 The crime was admitted in the CBI office located in Char Imli area in Bhopal
 in sari soochnaaon kaa istemaal chargeshit taiyaar karne main kiya jayega jo may ke ant main daakhil kii jaani he
 The characters involved in this unexpected love triangle were: Prem Deewani Zahida, who was married to one of the richest Bohra dynasties in Bhopal; Aashiq Mijaz Dhruv Narayan Singh, son of former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister and former Governor of Bihar Govind Narayan Singh; And the fiery Shehla, who was an event management professional and established herself as an RTI activist
 jis din shahala kii hatya hui, us din vah anna hajaare kii ek raily main bhaag lene vaali thi
 The murder shocked the sleepy city of Bhopal

 On the other hand, Dhruv had to resign as the vice president of Madhya Pradesh BJP

 Vijay and Shehla had become very close in the last two years
 sibiai ko july or agast, 2011 main unke bich hue 400 phone kol ke saboot or 2010 main unki switzraland yatra kii antarang tasviren milin
 Shehla's mobile records show that Vijay had a lengthy conversation with her just before her assassination on August 15, 2011 and again the next morning
 sibiai hatya main vijay ke shaamil hone kii sambhaavna se inkaar karti he
 Investigation is on about Dhruv's role in this episode
 sach jaanane ke liye dhruv kaa 24 march ko poligraph test hua, jisamen unhone shahala, jaahida or anya mahilaon ke saath sambandhon ke bare main shekhi baghaari
 What came to light is like this: Dhruv was playing a dangerous game with Zahida
 vah yah jataakar uski jalan badhaate rahete the ki shahala ke saath unke ab bhi sambandh hai
 This fueled Zahida's poison towards Shehla, which she has also clearly revealed in her diary
 jaahida likhti he ki vah shahala par najar rakhane ke liye uske gharelu naukar irshaad ko paise detii thi
 CBI decided to take advantage of the rift in dhruva-zahida relations
 usne dhruv ko jaahida ke daftar se mili sidi dikhaate hue unase poochtacha kii
 Dhruv was stunned by the CD as he had no idea that Zahida had recorded intimate moments with him
 unhone sidi kaa raaj na kholane ke liye sibiai se anurodh kiya or jaahida ke bare main munh kholane ko raji ho gaye
 The CBI officials secretly recorded Dhruv's reply and showed it to Zahida
 jaahida tab tak jaan chuki thi ki sara khel khatm ho gaya
 Realizing that she is alone in the fight, she said Dhruva was also involved in the plot to kill Shehla
 jaahida ne dhruv par aarope lagaaya ki ve use shahala kii hatya ke liye uksaate rahete the
 He also claimed that he had introduced him to Saqib Ali 'danger'
 saaqib sthaneey gunda he jisane kathith rup se irfan or tabaish khan naamak bhaade ke hatyaron ke jariye shahala ko maravaaya
 However, Zahida could not provide evidence to support her claims
 lekin sibiai 15 agast, 2011 ko shahala ko kiye gaye dhruv ke kol kii jaanch kar rahi he
 On August 16, 25 minutes before Shehla's murder, at 10:50 am, there was a call from Dhruv's wife Vandana on his landline
 vandana kuch nahin boli or aath second baad phone kaat diya
 Shortly thereafter, Vandana called Vijay's number in Delhi
 ve unki patni, jinka naam bhi vandana tha, ko chetavanee dena chaahati thim
 Vandana told CBI, "I wanted to tell them that Shehla is ruining our families
" '' sibiai ne hatya main unki sambhavit bhoomika kii bhi jaanch kii
 But he later rejected this option

 Cannot open his mouth in front of him
 ''sibiai ne jaahida kii sahayika 25 varshiya sabaa faruki ko bhi is andeh main giraftaar kiya he ki vah aparaadh main shaamil ho sakati he
 Saba told the CBI that she tried to warn 'uppi' many times that what they were doing would result in a bad outcome, but they ignored it

 jiesti (GST) bharat sarkaar kii nai pratyaksh kar vyavastha he joki 1 july 2017 se lagu ho rahi he
 The full name of GST is Goods and Service Tax (GST)
 yah centre or rajyon dwaara lagaae gaye 20 se adhik apratyaksh karon ke evaj main lagaaya ja rahaa he
 GST is to be implemented across the country from 1 July
 jiesti lagane ke baad kai sevaaon or vastuon par lagane vaale tex samaapt ho jaaenge
 From the production of any goods to the hands of the consumer, many types of taxes have been imposed till now
 is ek tex ke lagane se ye alag alag tarah ke tex samaapt ho jaaenge yaa yun kahen ki kisi vastu yaa seva ke aapke haathon tak pahunchane main lagane vaale vibhinn prakaar ke kar ab is kar ke bheetar hi samo liye jaaenge
 But it is not that it will cause any loss to traders or traders engaged in various stages
 is aakhir stage par lagane vaale tex main sabhi benifit samahit honge
 Obviously, this tax on goods and services will have different items on different goods and services
 aaie aapako bataaen ki iske tahat koun koun se tex aaenge or yah kis varg ke logon par kya asar daalega
 So let's first know about the various GST taxes which will include other taxes
 vartmaan main lagu ye tex aage chalakar jiesti main sammilit kar die jaaenge : Central Excise Duty, Additional Excise Duty, Service Tax, Additional Customs Duty, Additional Duty of Customs
 rajya str par maujuud ye tex jiesti main sammilit kar die jaanege : State VAT / Sales Tax, Entertainment Tax (other than taxes levied by local bodies), Central Sales Tax (one that is levied by the Center and levied by the States), octroi and entry tax, purchase tax, luxury tax, Tax on betting, lottery and gambling
 jiesti ko lagu karne ke baad isse jude sabhi staron par iskaa napha hoga
 Such as various related states, the central government, manufacturers and suppliers of goods and services, and the consumers present on the last phase of this chain will also get the benefit
 aaie ek najar main jaane ki kise kitna kis prakaar se phayda pahonchega : What will the business and the industry benefit from - GSTN means Goods and Services Tax Network (BGSTN) will boost the entire system of GST
 sabhi karadaataaon ke liye registration, riterns, pement aadi se judi sabhi sevaaon ko jiestn ke jariye praapt kiya ja sakegaa jisase jiesti kaa anupaalan zyada aasaan or paardarshee tareeke se ho sake
 There will be uniformity in tax rates and its structure
 jiesti yah sunishchit karegaa ki apratyaksh kar kii daren or dhaancha puure desh main kaaman ho
 In other words, GST will make doing business in the country tax neutral irrespective of the person doing business in any city or state
 aam aadmi ke liye jiesti alag tarah ke badlaav lekar aayega
 These include some things being expensive but some things being cheap
 choti kaaren, esayuvi, bike, paint or cement, movie tikat, bijli ke saamaan (pankhe, balb, water heater, air cooler), rozmarra kii zarurat ke saamaan, radimaid kapade, jiesti lagu ho jane ke baad inaki kharid sasti ho sakati he
 While commercial vehicles such as cigarettes, trucks, mobile phone calls, clothing, branded jewelery, rail, bus, air tickets can be expensive
 pehle paanch saal tak kaaron, sheetay peyon or tambaakoo utpaadon jaisi samagriyon par kuch anya kar bhi lagaae jaaenge, taaki rajyon ke nuksaan kii bharpai kii ja sake
 The Compensation Act has been framed in such a way as to make the constitutional promise made by the Central Government to compensate the revenue loss of the states on the implementation of GST
 tippaniyan Four rates in the GST regime - 5, 12, 18 and 28 percent - have been fixed
 haalanki, adhiktam 40 pratishat tak kii sheersh dar (top rate) rakhi gai he
 This rate is kept in view of financial emergency
 jiesti lagu hone ke baad vastuon evam sevaaon par keval teen tarah ke tex vasule jaaenge
 The first CGST, ie Central GST, which the central government will levy
 doosraa esgsti, yani state jiesti, jo rajya sarkaar apane yahaan hone vaale kaarobaar par vasuulegi
 Third, if any business is between two states, then IGST, ie Integrated GST will be charged
 ise centre sarkaar vasuul karegi or use donon rajyon main samaan anupaat main baant diya jayega
 GST taxation system is in force in about 160 countries of the world
 bharat main iskaa vichaar atal bihari vaajapeyi sarkaar dwaara saal 2000 main laayaa gaya
 In the opinion of experts, GST will prove to be an inflation-raising tax in the first three years, as is evident from the examples of Malaysia and other countries
 kinhin vastuon ke utpaadan se lekar uske upabhokta ke haathon main pahunchane ke bich kai prakaar ke tex ab tak lagate rahe hai
 These different types of taxes will be eliminated with the imposition of this one tax, or say that different types of taxes which can reach your hands of any goods or service will now be collected within this tax
 lekin aisa nahin he ki isse vibhinn charnon main lage vyapaariyon yaa kaarobaariyon ko koi ghaataa hoga
 At this end, all the benefits will be included in the tax on the stage
 jaahir he ki vastu evam sevaaon par lagane vaala is tex kii alag alag saamaan va seva par alag alag mad hogi
 Let us tell you which tax will come under it and what effect it will have on which class of people
 to aaie sabase pehle yah jaane ki vibhinn jiesti karon ke bare main jinamein anya kar samahit kar die jaaenge
 These currently applicable taxes will later be included in GST: central exise duty, adishnal exise duty, sarvice tex, adishnal customs duty, adishnal duty of customs
 These taxes present at the state level will be included in GST: state waite / cells tex, manoranjan kar (sthaneey nikaay dwaara lagaae jane vaale karon ke atirikt), central cells tex (vah jo centre dwaara lagaaya jaataa he or rajyon dwaara vasula jaataa he), okatrai or entry tex, parchez tex, lagjri tex, satte, lottery or jue par tex
 After the implementation of GST, it will benefit at all levels associated with it
 jaise ki vibhinn sambandhit rajyon, centre sarkaar, saamaan va sevaaon ke nirmaataaon or aapurtikartaaon, or is chen ke aakhri charan par maujuud upabhokta ko bhi iskaa laabh milegaa
 Let us know at a glance how which will benefit: bijness or industry ko isse kya laabh hoga- jiestn yani maal evam sevakar network (BGSTN) ke jariye jiesti ke puure ke puure system ko boost milegaa
 All services related to registration, returns, payment etc
 can be obtained through GSTN for all taxpayers, so that compliance with GST can be done in a much easier and transparent manner
 kar daron or uske dhaanche main ekarupatha aegi
 GST will ensure that indirect tax rates and structures are common across the country
 duusare shabdon main, jiesti desh main bijness karne ko tex neutral bana degaa chaahe vyakti kisi bhi shahar yaa rajya main kyon na kaarobaar kar rahaa ho
 GST will bring different changes for the common man
 inamen kuch chizon kaa mahangaa hona lekin kuch chizon kaa sasta hona shaamil he
 Small cars, suvs, bikes, paint and cement, movie tickets, electrical goods (fans, bulbs, water heaters, air coolers), everyday necessities, ready-made clothes, their purchase can become cheaper once GST is implemented
 
 jabaki cigarette, trek jaise vyavsaayik vaahan, mobile phone kol, kapade, branded jewelery, rail, bas, hawaii tikat mahange ho sakate hai
 For the first five years, some other taxes will also be levied on materials like cars, cold drinks and tobacco products, to compensate for the loss of the states
 muawza kanoon is lihaaz se taiyaar kiya gaya he, taaki jiesti ke lagu hone par rajyon ke rajasav nuksaan kii bharpai ke liye centre sarkaar dwaara kiye gaye vaade ko sanvaidhanik jama pahanaaya ja sake
 The comments jiesti vyavastha main chaar daren- 5, 12, 18 or 28 pratishat- tay kii gai hai
 However, a maximum rate of up to 40 percent has been kept
 yah dar vittiya apaat sthiti ko dhyaan main rakhte hue rakhi gai he
 After GST is implemented, only three types of taxes will be levied on goods and services
 pehla sijisti, yani central jiesti, jo centre sarkaar vasuulegi
 The second SGST, ie State GST, which the state government will levy on its business
 teesraa hoga vah jo koi kaarobaar agar do rajyon ke bich hoga to us par ijiasti, yani integrated jiesti vasula jayega
 It will be recovered by the Central Government and it will be divided in equal proportion in both the states

 Samson scored 52 runs, but Glenn Maxwell scored an 89-run innings to give Punjab a target of 193 runs
 samson ne ipel kii website se kaha, wicket ballebaajon kaa madadgaar tha or 190 ran banane ke baad bhi muqabla barabari kaa tha
 It was the day of Punjab when everything suited them
 unhone kaha, mujhe hameshaa rajasthan royles ke liye khilne main majaa aata he or mujhe khushi he ki main team ko acha score de sakaa, lekin itnaa acha khilne ke baad bhi harkar dukh hota he
 He said, this year i want to play the role of finisher in more and more matches
 main apni ranneeti ke anuroop kheloongaa, jo abhi tak mujhe kamyaabi dilaati ai he
 If you are in a job and live in a rented house, then this news is very important for you
 echaare aggempshan clem ke jariye inakam tex bachaana ab pehle kii tarah aasaan nahin hoga
 Now you will also have to provide PAN details of your landlord
 haalanki yah niyam salanaa 1 lakh rupee se kam kiraaya dene vaale ykardaata par lagu nahin hoga
 In this regard, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has issued a circular
 agar aapke makaan maalik ke paas pan nahin he, to is sambandh main use diclaration dena hoga iske alaava ritern bharne vaale ko apane makaan maalik ke naam or pate kaa bhi detail dena hoga
 Let us tell you that till now rent of less than Rs 15,000 per month did not require the PAN of the landlord, but with the new rules coming, this exemption has come down to Rs 8,333 per month
 sibiditi ke is nae niyam ko tex churaane par lagaam lagane kii kavayad se jodakar dekha ja rahaa he
 Because many income tax payers have been giving fake receipts by increasing the rent to get maximum benefit
 haalanki industry ke logon kaa maananaa he ki nae niyam lagu hone ke baad eemaandaar tex peyars kii bhi mushkilen badhane vaali hai
 Because on most occasions the landlords take great care in giving their PAN details

 party mahasachiv gulam nabi aaazaad ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha ki rahul gandhi ne uttar pradesh main atyant pichde varg ke netaaon ke saath ek baithak main yah aashwaasan diya
 Uttar Pradesh party in-charge Azad said that Rahul assured the leaders that his party would include the promise in the election manifesto and implement it if it came to power

 It has often been alleged that the influential Yadav community benefited the most under the SP rule in the state
 tippaniyan Azad said that Congress has played an important role in implementing reservation within reservation in about 10 states including Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra

 UGC NET Answer Key jammu-kashmir ke pulavama(pulwama Terror Attack) main hue aatanki hamale main shahid hue siarpief ke 40 javaanon kii shahadat par china ne gahari sahanubhuti to jataai he, magar usne apane sandesh main pakistan kaa zikr tak nahin kiya he
 In a condolence message sent to External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has stressed that terrorism is the common enemy of mankind and China strongly opposes every form of terrorism and strongly condemns it
 haalanki, chini videsh mantri wang yi ne apane sandesh main pakistan kaa koi zikr nahin kiya he
 While the terror attack in Pulwama has been claimed by Pakistan-based terrorist organization jaish-e-mohammed
 bataa den ki guuruuvaar ko pulavama main hue aatanki hamale main 40 siarpief ke jawan shahid ho gaye the or yah ek aatmghaatee hamalaa tha
 In his condolence message sent to External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj on Friday, Yi said that he was shocked when he came to know that there was a suicide attack in Kashmir and it caused a large number of security casualties
 shaheedon ke pariwaron ke prati samvednaa vyakt karte hue yi ne kaha, ‘kshetra ke deshon ko sahyog badhanaa chahie or sanyukt rup se aatankwaad ke khatre se nipatna chahie or kshetra kii shanti evam suraksha ko banaae rakhana chahie
 'actually, India has said that we have such evidence of Pakistan being involved in the Pulwama attack, on which there can be no dispute
 haalanki, bharat ke aaropon ko pakistan sarkaar nakaar chuki he
 Pakistan has said that 'we reject any objection of the Indian media and government by linking the attack to Pakistan without any investigation'
 pakistan sarkaar ne ek bayaan main kaha ki kashmir ke pulavama main hamalaa ‘‘ek gambhir chintaa kaa vishay he''
 In the decision of the Cabinet Committee on Security Affairs after the Pulwama attack, the Government of India has taken away the status of 'most Favored Nation' (MFN) from Pakistan
 darasal menen kaa matlab he most faverd nesan, yani sarvaadhik tarjihi desh
 Based on the World Trade Organization and International Trade Rules, the most favored country in trade (MFN) is given the status
 menen kaa darja mil jane par darjaprapt desh ko is baat kaa aashwaasan rahata he ki use kaarobaar main nuksaan nahin pahunchaaya jayega
 The Pakistan-based terrorist group jaish-e-mohammad has claimed responsibility for the terror attack by the United Nations
 bharat maang karata aayaa he ki jaish ke sargana masood ajahar ko vaishvik aatankwaadi kii suchi main daalaa jaae
 If Azhar is put on the UN Security Council list of terrorists, he will be banned from traveling around the world and his assets will be confiscated
 darasal, isse pehle guuruuvaar ko siarpief kaa kafila jammu se srinagar ja rahaa tha
 The convoy had about 78 vehicles and 2500 personnel
 usee dauraan bain ore se overtek kar visphotak se ladi ek car ai or usne siarpief kii bas main takkar maar di
 The car hit by the terrorist had about 60 kg of explosives
 isaki vajah se visphot itnaa ghaatak hua ki isamen 40 jawan shahid ho gaye
 On this incident, PM Modi has directly said that the terrorists have made a big mistake and now they will have to bear the consequences
 32 lakh atm ke pin chori hone kii ashanka koi aam baat nahin he
 According to the report, these pins have been stolen due to withdrawal of money from the malware ATM machine
 sirf pin chori hue hai yaa phir or bhi jaankariyaan yah saaf nahin he
 Banks whose customers have had their data stolen include SBI, HDFC, ICICI, Yes Bank and Axis Bank
 haalanki kisi bank ne abhi tak yah nahin bataaya he ki aakhir puraa maamaal kya he
 The big question is whether the dangerous hackers have broken into the ATM machine one by one? Have all the ATM cards' data been stolen or cloned all debit cards from the ATM machine through malware injection
 ham aapako bataate hai mailaware ke bare main ki yah kaam kaise karata he or kis tarah se yah atm kaa data uda saktaa he
 Malware is actually a dangerous script in which programs are written with the purpose of stealing and wasting data kept in the system
 ise kisi atechament yaa removable drive ke jariye sarwar main inject kiya jaataa he
 Apparently the hackers may have injected it into the server of sbi's ATM network
 kyonki atm ke software interconnected hote hai
 Once it is put in the server, it sometimes needs remote access to run, but sometimes it activates itself
 actevet hone ke baad system se mahatvapurn data havers ke paas jaani shuru ho jaati hai
 Obviously, if this had happened, not only the ATM PIN but other card information such as card number would also have gone to the hackers
 kaise lagi send?esbiai yaa duusare bank ke atm ke software interconnected hote hai or kaaphi sicyor bhi hote hai
 a hacker has told us that, 'the hackers may have broken through the open network
 kyonki iske liye unhen zyada mehnat bhi nahin kerani padati he
 Sometimes networks are left open due to negligence
 'mailaware ke jariye havers ke paas in atm network main yuj kiye gaye cards ke detel uplabdh ho jaatin hai
 However, it is not easy to get money from any debit card even after getting the card details, because now payment gateway requires either OTP or 3D secure code
 lekin havers ke paas iskaa bhi kaat maujuud he
 First they create a clone of the card, then apply the stolen data on that card
 isse 100 fisadi to nahin lekin zyaadaar cards se paise udaana havers ke liye aasaan hota he
 The University of Britain has refused to admit 700 foreign students in subjects such as nuclear, biological and chemical warfare
 admician na dene ke peeche kaaran britain kaa dar he, unhen lagata he ki shiksha lene ke baad videsh log parmaanu, rasinic or jaivik hathiyaar bananaa sikh jaaenge yaa phir aatanki sanghathanon kii madad karne lagenge 
 This was revealed in a recent report in an English newspaper

 The court has already shown strictness on the stove: The Supreme Court has said that people have the right to live, burn a stall and violate the right of the other to live
 justise arun mishra kii bench ne is maamle par tippanee karte hue kaha tha ki centre sarkaar kare yaa phir rajya sarkaar, isse hamen matlab nahin he

 Taking a dig at the Center and the Delhi government, the head bench of the tribunal headed by Justice AK Goel said that why the government is not able to control it? Now we are running here, there and no effective efforts are being made yet
 tribunel ne kaha ki bharat sarkaar ko desh main paraali jalaane kii samasya se nipatane ke liesarvottam samaadhaan khojna chahie

 saujany: Newsflicks Aamir Khan's Secret Secret star is scheduled to release on October 19
 isamen unke saath dangal girl jaayra wasim mukhya bhoomika main hai
 Although Aamir is doing a cameo role in this film, but he has described it as the most difficult role of his career so far
 yun bhi unke sabhi role darshakon ko hairaan karte hai or phir hairaan karti he unki filmon kii box offis saxes
 But Aamir does not consider himself the reason for this success
 iske peeche wo jo kaaran bataate hai, wo kaaphi dilachasp hai
 Speaking to the website inuth, Aamir said that he is not the writer behind his films being a hit, but the writer and director of the film
 aamir kehete hai, ''sirf acha kaam hi he, jo kisi ko star banaata he
 When a film turns out to be good, that's when a star is born
 star hone se koi film nahin chalati
 i can never say that a film has been successful because of me
 aamir kaa kahana he ki agar aap pike yaa dangal yaa thri edinuts ko dekhen, to meri vajah se jo ho sakat tha wo film relies ke pehle hafte main ho gaya, lekin iske baad bhi film chali, kyonki film acchhee thi
 The stars bring in only the first three days of collection, the rest of the film is run by the writer and director

 aisa hi ek taja udhaaharan patna airport par dekhne ko mila jahaan kendriya mantri giriraaj singh ke samarthakon ne suraksha kaary main lage siaisef ke javaanon se dhakkamukki kii
 The CCTV footage of the incident clearly shows that the minister's supporters are forcing the soldiers
 lekin karrwai patna airport ke siaisef ke commandent dharmaveer yadav ke khilaaf hui
 Yadav has been transferred to Amritsar and Vishal Dubey has been sent in his place
 ye tabadalaa itane aanan fanan main kiya gaya ki donon adhikariyon ko apane tabadale ke nae jagah par turant jwine karne ke liye bhi aadesh diya gaya
 However, on September 6, when Singh was coming for the first time after increasing the number of his portfolios in the Union Cabinet, his supporters were given 22 free passes, but from where passengers leave Patna Airport, the road was jammed by Singh's supporters
 Was done isapar pehle suraksha agency ke javaanon se kahasuni hui or phir baad main hathapayee kii naubat aa gayi

 The CISF officials are describing it as a regular transfer
 lekin bijepi ke netaa bhi maanate hai ki itani jaldi or jis teji se adhikariyon ko jwine karne kaa nirdesh hua he usase sandesh shayad thik nahin jayega
 After contacting Giriraj Singh, there was no communication in this regard

 At this, the security agency's soldiers were heard and then later there was a scuffle
 is maamle kii shikaayat bhi siaisef ne kii thi
 The comments giriraaj singh kuch varsh purv patna airport ke tatkaaleen nideshak atul dikshit ke khilaaf visheshadhikaar kaa prastaav laaye the or tab dikshit kaa tabadalaa kolkata airport par kar diya gaya tha
 But certainly the morale of security personnel is likely to be adversely affected after the latest developments
 siaisef ke adhikari ise niyamit sthanantaran bataa rahe hai
 But BJP leaders also believe that the message will not be corrected by such quick and fast officers who have been instructed to join
 giriraaj singh se sampark karne par unase is sambandh main baatcheet nahin ho paayi

 -input bhashaa Ram Rahim, the head of Dera Sacha Sauda and convicted in the rape case, has been sentenced to 20 years rigorous punishment by the court
 use rohtak jail main kaid rakhaa jayega
 Thus it seems that Ram Rahim's life will end in the prison walls and the court has not given him any chance to improve and start his life again
 lekin ram rahim ke andar jis tarah ke super tallent hone kaa daawa unke chele karte hai or use jis prakaar super human jaisaa pesh kiya gaya he, agar uskaa dashansh tallent or saamaajik sarokaar bhi vah jail main dikhaae to apane baaki jivan kaa uddhaar to kar hi saktaa he, kaidiyon ke jivan main bhi kuch badlaav laa saktaa he
 However, the kind of crime that Ram Rahim has committed, it will not be easy for him to gain respect even among the prisoners who have committed all kinds of heinous crimes, but looking at the way he has made his acceptance in all religions
 Maybe he has a chance to improve the rest of his life by doing some really good work
 ek-do nahin, darjanon tarah ke hunar kaa daawaaraam rahim ke andar jitani pratibha bataai jaati he, jaahir he vah kisi insaan main nahin ho sakati, usne apane bare main jis tarah kaa prachaar kiya, uske bare main jis tarah kaa aura banaaya gaya
 He actually forced his disciples to consider him like a god
 deraa sachcha sauda sanstha ke mutabik tathakthith sant gurmeet ram rahim insaan ke bheetar pratibhaaen kuta-kuta kar bhari thim
 Dera Sacha Sauda claims that it has taught medicine to over 5 crore people for free
 yah daawa kiya jaataa he ki ram rahim ke unic medishan se karodon logon ko apane jivan kaa vaastavik uddeshy or sambhaavna kaa pataa chalaa he
 So now in the lonely life of the prison, Ram Rahim can now try to make a change in his life through self-determination and unique medicine, and after that, by letting the other inmates of the prison learn about this meditation, he can help them to know the real purpose of life
 Can help kisi-kisi pratibhadera sachcha sauda ke mutabik ram rahim ko behtareen photography aati he, use mujeec se lekar ejineering, spotrs se krishi tak main maharath hasil he
 He is a writer, inventor, athlete, speaker of many languages, scholar, scientist, theologist, musician and humanist
 ram rahim ko 32 khelon main nipun hone kaa daawa kiya jaataa he
 These include sports like ballball, net ball, throw ball, kabaddi, lawn tennis, cricket, football, billiard
 usko vanderphul healer bataaya gaya he
 According to the claim, he also has a good knowledge of Ayurveda, Yoga, Asanas etc
 use ek visheshgy manovaigyanik, counslar bhi bataaya ja rahaa he
 He is being described as a poet, lyricist and author of all books and literature
 use kai bhashaaon kaa gyaata bataaya jaataa he
 He is also claimed to be a skilled rallyist and auto designer
 daawey ke mutabik vah ek behatari athlete he
 All the songs like Rock, Sufi, Punjabi, Fok are claiming equal rights
 sanstha ke anusaar vah ek unirvasal diziner he
 Fashion designer, magazine designer, interior designer, exterior designer and designer of various things
 
 
 ram rahim ko banjar jameen ko hare bhare upjau kheton main badalane vaala jaadugar bataaya gaya he
 He is said to be a master of plantation and eco friendly farming
 use ek behtareen shef, nutrishanist or ek samaaj sudhaarak bataaya jaataa he
 Ram Rahim's dera has been claiming to carry out many public welfare functions
 inamen se ek yuvaaon ko nashe se dur rakhane kii muhim he
 Baba took the form of a rock star to guide the youth
 usne kai rock star kii tarah kai concert kiye
 Later he also did many films
 inamen massenger of god pramukh he
 According to the claim, he wrote, directed and sang the story himself in the film
 vah apni filmon main galat kaam karne waalon kaa safaya karata najar aata he
 Think it is possible for a person to have so much talent somewhere
 lekin ham yah maan lete hai ki jin darjanon pratibhaaon kaa daawa ram rahim ke bheetar hone kaa kiya jaataa he ki uskaa kuch hissaa uske andar hoga, to iskaa istemaal kar ek achche kaidi banane ke maukey uske paas honge
 If he claims to be a spiritual saint, then if he actually has only a part of spirituality within him then he can change the life of the inmates of the prison
 apni pratibha kaa istemaal karte hue vah jail main kaidiyon ko tamaam bhashaaen, skill, sportrs sikhaane main kar saktaa he
 He can make a big change in the lives of prisoners through music, yoga, spirituality, meditation
 ab dekhnaa yahi hoga ki ram rahim ke jail jane se kaidiyon ke achche din aate hai yaa nahin

 The court said in its judgment that BSF and CRPF were considered by the Organized Group a Service Self Government in 1986

 Rejecting all objections of the Center and the IPS Association, the Supreme Court upheld the Delhi High Court's three September 2015 decision in which a bench of justices Najmi Waziri and Kailash Gambhir ruled that the non-functional recommended by the Sixth Central Pay Commission
 Financial upgradation should also be applied to officers of the Central Paramilitary Forces

 The decision would directly benefit about 6000 senior officers of the Central Paramilitary Forces BSF, CRPF, ITBP, CISF and SSB, who were deprived of financial benefits due to lack of promotion due to vacancies on the preferred ranks

 Mr
 Ravish, i am not lying
 sau fisadi eemaandaar afasar hum or hazaron mazaduron kaa bhala kiya he
 i would have spent many nights reading all the documents that i had brought
 pawan kumaar ranchi ke shram pravartan adhikari hai
 You citizens and we journalists are also less aware of the scope of work and authority of labor officer
 isliye apni ashankaon ke baad bhi pawan kumaar kii baton ko gaur se sunata rahaa
 Why would an officer cry tears to a journalist? Even if i show it on TV, then Pawan Kumar's own agenda will be fulfilled by which he will take oath as the Labor Minister after a story
 pawan kii baton ko sunate hue siharataa rahaa ki aam mazaduron ke saath kya kya hota hoga
 What kind of Nexus is made in these offices of Labor Ministry, do we know? If a raid is conducted on the houses of all the labor officers and employees, then how much money can be made out of the sweat earnings of the workers
 pehle pawan kumaar kaa kaam bataata hum
 Their job is to check the records of the companies so that the laborers get minimum wages and on retirement, the company pays the entire amount of gratuity on time
 agar koi shram adhikari ye sunishchit karaane lage to kisi bhi sarkaar kii kitni prashansa hogi
 But if the government machinery is against it, then what will you do by crying your grief to journalists with zero rating like Ravish Kumar
 kya samaaj yaa pathak varg aise afasaron ke liye khadaa hoga
 Will not done
 pawan kumaar ne apana kaam karnaa shuru kiya or har din fil par companiyon or contract par lebar rakhane vaale sanghathanon ke kilaaf likhane lage
 Started raising objections unki aapattiyon kii nyaayik jaanch kii ja sakati he
 The result was that all became against them because by doing this the workers started getting their rights
 rote rote pawan ne kaha ki main tabadalaa yaa nilamban se nahin darataa
 i have worked honestly for the good of the workers
 mujhe koi barkhaast karke nahin jhukaa saktaa
 i can easily ignore those allegations and go to the place where i have been transferred
 pawan kii baton se laga ki unke daftar ke chaparasi se lekar sahakarmi or varisht tak companiyon se mili hue hai
 They go out to raid, the peon and the clerk inform
 unki anupasthiti main lok adaalat lagaakar shikayaton kaa companiyon ke paksh main nipataara kar dete hai jabaki shram pravartan adhikari ke bagair lok adaalat lag hi nahin sakati
 On May 3, he was attacked by the employees of the Regional Labor Commissioner office
 iske saboot main ve medical report se lekar tamaam report dikhaate rahe
 What a terrible thing that employees wring the neck of their senior officer
 pawan kii shikaayat par inkaa tabadalaa hua tha
 They were frozen at this place for many years
 ab tabadalaa phir se ruk gaya he
 When Pawan filed an FIR with the police against the incident of assault, the local BJP leader in return filed a case against him for assaulting the employees
 bhaajapa netaa kyon maamla darj karaayenge? marpet kii ghatana hui he to karmchaaree kara sakate the
 The Bihar Minerals Workers Organization (lohardaga), associated with the Indian Workers Union, has also complained against Pawan that Pawan Kumar was roaming with Hindalco mine outsiders and trying to form a union
 sahakarmiyon ne bhi es tii es si act ke tahat muqadame darj karaaye or companiyon se shikaayatein karain
 Pawan had reported more than two crore cases of gratuity payment violation against the company who complained
 pawan kaa paksh suna tak nahin gaya or wo puri fil nasht kar di gai
 Another company's theft case file was also disappeared
 ye sab pawan kumaar ke apane paksh hai lekin jis tarah se isamen raajnneetik dalon ke netaa shaamil he usase pataa chalata he ki is vibhaag ke tel se kitnon kii gaadi daud rahi he
 Talking to Pawan that companies are stealing minimum wages on a large scale
 rajya main kahin bhi nunatam mazaduri nahin di ja rahi he
 This will be happening in other states also
 shram pravartan adhikari maamle kii jaanch kar shunya se das guna tak jurmaana laga saktaa he
 If a company has not paid ten thousand rupees of minimum wages to a worker, then the labor enforcement officer can impose a fine up to ten times i
e
 up to one lakh but in most cases not more than five hundred rupees
 pradhanmantri tamaam jurmaanon kii suchi website par prakashit karne ke aadesh de sakate hai
 Similarly, hearing about the theft of gratuity of the workers, i was stunned
 agar ye sab sach he to sthiti kitni bhayaavah he
 Not only this, without training and safety, the workers are transported explosive material
 pawan ne apni shikaayat shram mantralay se lekar pradhanmantri karyaalay se bhi kii he
 The Prime Minister's Office sent him back to the Ministry of Labor and the matter reached there, against whom a complaint was made
 pawan ke anusaar shram mantralay ne jaanch kar maamle main lipapoti hi kii he
 Pawan told that he has now started writing freely on Facebook
 dilli main ek press conference bhi kiya tha jisamen kanhaiya kumaar bhi shaamil hue the
 Pawan is studying from JNU
 unki baton main wo adarshavaad jhalkata he jise hamaari raajnneeti ant main haraa hi detii he
 The game of misleading starts by making various allegations and the morale of such officer is broken
 pawan kii kahani sirf ek afasar kii nahin he
 There is a system which is robbing the workers by joining the companies
 yah kahani bataati he ki shram andolan bhi bheetar se sad gaya he
 He talks about the interest of the workers from outside, inside joins hands with companies
 maine yah kahani pawan se baat karke likhi he
 There may be more sides, but you know that people on the government side do not talk so easily
 is kahani se shoshan or lut kaa jo chakra saamne aata he usase bahut had tak koun inkaar kar sakegaa
 The comments pawan kumaar ko sunate hue yahi laga ki koi apni eemaandaaree ke kaaran kitna akelaa ho jaataa he
 Both power and society marginalize him
 samaaj kaa bhrasht hissaa hi naitikta kaa daawa kar letaa he or bahes lut le jaataa he
 One who is honest remains alone
 dastavezon kii photocopy jamaa karne lagata he, bag main sambhaal kar rakhane lagata he is ummid main ki koi patrkaar in baton ko saamne laaegaa to kuch badlaav hoga
 i sat under my apprehensions, Pawan started saying that one day the world will change
 pawan apni maa ke liye meri tasviir khinchne lage or main aap pathakon ke bare main sochane laga ki kya vaaqai is kahani ko padhakar lagata he ki duniya badalegi! main aap pathakon ko acchhee tarah se pahachaanata hum
 Pawan Kumar may not know you, that's why a journalist came with a bag of expectations on his shoulder
 is kahani ko padhakar mujhe apni vyathaa kii filein na bhejein
 Fight your battle alone like Pawan Kumar
 main nahin lard saktaa
 Pawan Kumar is the labor enforcement officer of Ranchi
 aap naagarik or ham patrkaar bhi shram adhikari ke kaam or adhikaar ke daayre ke bare main kam jaankaree rakhte hai
 So despite his apprehensions, Pawan kept listening to Kumar's words carefully
 ek adhikari kyon kisi patrkaar ke paas apane aansu roega? main tivi par dikhaa bhi duungaa to pawan kumaar kaa apana koun sa aisa agenda puraa ho jayega jisase ve ek story ke baad shram mantri ke taur par shapath le lenge
 Listening to the words of Pawan shirked what would happen to the common laborers
 shram mantralay ke in karyaalayon main kis tarah kaa nexs bana hua he kya ham jaanate bhi hai? tamaam shram adhikariyon or karmchaariyon ke ghar chaape maare jaaen to mazaduron kii paseene kii kamai kaa kitna bada khazaana nikal saktaa he
 Let me first tell the work of Pawan Kumar
 inkaa kaam he companiyon ke record check karnaa taaki mazdoor ko nunatam mazaduri mili or ritair hote hi company gracuty kii puri raqam kaa samay par bhugtan kare
 If a labor officer starts ensuring this, then how much praise would be given to any government
 magar sarkaar kaa tantra hi iske kilaaf ho to aap raveesh kumaar jaise zero reating vaale patrakaron ke paas apana dukhada rokar kya kar lenge
 Will the society or the readership stand for such officers
 nahin hoga
 Pawan Kumar started his work and started writing on file every day against companies and organizations that contract labor
 aapatti uthaane lage
 Their objections can be judged
 nateeja yah hua ki sab kilaaf ho gaye kyonki aisa karne se mazaduron ko haq milane laga
 Crying, Pawan said that i am not afraid of transfer or suspension
 maine mazaduron kii bhalaai ke liye eemaandaaree se kaam kiya he
 No one can sack me and dismiss me
 main un aaropon ko nazarandaaz kar aaraam se us jagah par ja saktaa hum jahaan meraa tabadalaa hua he
 Pawan talks that he has met companies from his office peon to colleague and senior
 ve chapa maarane nikalate hai, chaparasi or clerk soochna de dete hai
 In his absence, Lok Adalat is set up and the grievances are disposed of in favor of companies, whereas without Adalat Labor Officer, Lok Adalat cannot be held
 teen may ko kshetreey shram ayukta karyaalay ke karmchaariyon ne un par jaanaleva hamalaa kar diya
 In this evidence, he continued to show all the reports from the medical report
 kitni bhayanak baat he ki karmchaaree apane varisht afasar kii gardan marod den
 He was transferred on Pawan's complaint
 is jagah par ve kai saal se jame hue the
 Now the transfer has stopped again
 pawan ne jab marpet kii ghatana ke khilaaf police main praathmiki darj karai to badale main bhaajapa ke sthaneey netaa ne inke kilaaf karmchaariyon ke saath marpet karne kaa maamla darj kara diya
 Why will BJP leaders file a case? If there was an incident of assault, the employees could have got it done
 pawan ke khilaaf bhartiya mazdoor sangh se jude bihar minerals mazdoor sanghathan (lohardaga) ne bhi shikaayat kii he ki pawan kumaar hindalco khan kshetra main bahari vyakti lekar gum rahe the or union banane kaa prayaas kar rahe the
 Colleagues also filed cases under the STSC Act and made complaints to companies
 jis company ne shikaayat kii he uske kilaaf pawan ne gracuty bhugtan ke ulanghan ke do karod rupee se zyaada ke maamle ujagar kiye the
 Pawan's side was not even heard and the entire file was destroyed
 ek or company kii chori ke maamle kii fil bhi gaayab kar di gai
 All these are Pawan Kumar's own side but the way the leaders of political parties are involved in this, it shows how many cars are running from this department's oil
 pawan se baat kar laga ki companiyaan bade paimaane par nunatam mazaduri kii chori kar rahi hai
 There is no minimum wage anywhere in the state
 aisa duusare rajyon main bhi ho rahaa hoga
 The labor enforcement officer investigating the case can face a penalty of zero to ten times
 agar kisi company ne kisi mazdoor ko nunatam mazaduri ke das hazaar rupee nahin diye to shram pravartan adhikari das guna tak yani ek lakh tak kaa jurmaana laga saktaa he magar zyaadaatar maamalon main paanch sau rupaye se adhik kaa jurmaana nahin lagaaya jaataa
 The Prime Minister can order to publish the list of all the penalties on the website
 isi tarah mazaduron kii gracuty kii chori kaa kissa sunakar saham gaya
 If all this is true then how dreadful is the situation
 yahi nahin bina prashikshan or suraksha ke mazaduron se visphotak saamagree kii dhulaai karai jaati he
 Pawan has made his complaint from the Ministry of Labor to the Prime Minister's Office
 pradhanmantri karyaalay ne use waapas shram mantralay main bhej diya or maamla vahiin pahunchaa jinke kilaaf shikaayat kii gai thi
 According to Pawan, the Ministry of Labor has done a probe in the matter
 pawan ne bataaya ki ve ab fasebuk par khulkar likhane lage hai
 a press conference was also held in Delhi in which Kanhaiya Kumar also attended
 pawan je en you se padhe hue hai
 His words reflect the idealism which our politics defeats in the end
 tarah tarah ke aarope lagaakar bharamaane kaa khel shuru hota he or aise adhikari ke manobal ko tod diya jaataa he
 Pawan's story is not just about an officer
 ek tantra kii he jo companiyon se milakar mazaduron ko lut rahaa he
 This story tells that the labor movement has also rotted from within
 wo baahar se mazaduron ke hit kii baat karata he, andar andar companiyon se haath mila letaa he
 i wrote this story after talking to Pawan
 or paksh ho sakate hai par aap jaanate hai ki sarkari paksh ke log itani aasaani se baat nahin karte
 Who can deny the cycle of exploitation and plunder from this story to a great extent
 tippaniyan Listening to Pawan Kumar, he felt how lonely one gets because of his honesty
 satta or samaaj donon use haashiye par dhakel dete hai
 Only the corrupt part of society claims morality and loots the debate
 jo eemaandaar hota he wo akelaa rah jaataa he
 Photocopies of documents begin to be collected, kept in the bag in the hope that some change will happen if a journalist exposes these things
 main apni ashankaon ke giraft main baitha rahaa, pawan yah kah kar jane lage ki ek din duniya badalegi
 Pawan started drawing my picture for his mother and i started thinking about you readers, really, after reading this story it seems that the world will change! i recognize you readers well
 pawan kumaar shaayad aapako nahin jaanate isiilie ek patrkaar ke paas ummiido kaa bag kandhe par lad kar chale aae the
 Do not send me the files of your agony by reading this story
 pawan kumaar kii tarah apni ladaai akele laden
 i can't fight pehle pawan kumaar kaa kaam bataata hum
 Their job is to check the records of the companies so that the laborers get minimum wages and on retirement, the company pays the entire amount of gratuity on time
 agar koi shram adhikari ye sunishchit karaane lage to kisi bhi sarkaar kii kitni prashansa hogi
 But if the government machinery is against it, then what will you do by crying your grief to journalists with zero rating like Ravish Kumar
 kya samaaj yaa pathak varg aise afasaron ke liye khadaa hoga
 Will not done

 What a terrible thing that employees wring the neck of their senior officer
 pawan kii shikaayat par inkaa tabadalaa hua tha
 They were frozen at this place for many years
 ab tabadalaa phir se ruk gaya he
 When Pawan filed an FIR with the police against the incident of assault, the local BJP leader in return filed a case against him for assaulting the employees
 bhaajapa netaa kyon maamla darj karaayenge? marpet kii ghatana hui he to karmchaaree kara sakate the
 The Bihar Minerals Workers Organization (lohardaga), associated with the Indian Workers Union, has also complained against Pawan that Pawan Kumar was roaming with Hindalco mine outsiders and trying to form a union
 sahakarmiyon ne bhi es tii es si act ke tahat muqadame darj karaaye or companiyon se shikaayatein karain
 Pawan had reported more than two crore cases of gratuity payment violation against the company who complained
 pawan kaa paksh suna tak nahin gaya or wo puri fil nasht kar di gai
 Another company's theft case file was also disappeared
 ye sab pawan kumaar ke apane paksh hai lekin jis tarah se isamen raajnneetik dalon ke netaa shaamil he usase pataa chalata he ki is vibhaag ke tel se kitnon kii gaadi daud rahi he
 Talking to Pawan that companies are stealing minimum wages on a large scale
 rajya main kahin bhi nunatam mazaduri nahin di ja rahi he
 This will be happening in other states also

 Similarly, hearing about the theft of gratuity of the workers, i was stunned
 agar ye sab sach he to sthiti kitni bhayaavah he
 Not only this, without training and safety, the workers are transported explosive material
 pawan ne apni shikaayat shram mantralay se lekar pradhanmantri karyaalay se bhi kii he
 The Prime Minister's Office sent him back to the Ministry of Labor and the matter reached there, against whom a complaint was made
 pawan ke anusaar shram mantralay ne jaanch kar maamle main lipapoti hi kii he
 Pawan told that he has now started writing freely on Facebook
 dilli main ek press conference bhi kiya tha jisamen kanhaiya kumaar bhi shaamil hue the
 Pawan is studying from JNU
 unki baton main wo adarshavaad jhalkata he jise hamaari raajnneeti ant main haraa hi detii he
 The game of misleading starts by making various allegations and the morale of such officer is broken
 pawan kii kahani sirf ek afasar kii nahin he
 There is a system which is robbing the workers by joining the companies
 yah kahani bataati he ki shram andolan bhi bheetar se sad gaya he
 He talks about the interest of the workers from outside, inside joins hands with companies
 maine yah kahani pawan se baat karke likhi he
 There may be more sides, but you know that people on the government side do not talk so easily
 is kahani se shoshan or lut kaa jo chakra saamne aata he usase bahut had tak koun inkaar kar sakegaa
 The comments pawan kumaar ko sunate hue yahi laga ki koi apni eemaandaaree ke kaaran kitna akelaa ho jaataa he
 Both power and society marginalize him
 samaaj kaa bhrasht hissaa hi naitikta kaa daawa kar letaa he or bahes lut le jaataa he
 One who is honest remains alone
 dastavezon kii photocopy jamaa karne lagata he, bag main sambhaal kar rakhane lagata he is ummid main ki koi patrkaar in baton ko saamne laaegaa to kuch badlaav hoga
 i sat under my apprehensions, Pawan started saying that one day the world will change
 pawan apni maa ke liye meri tasviir khinchne lage or main aap pathakon ke bare main sochane laga ki kya vaaqai is kahani ko padhakar lagata he ki duniya badalegi! main aap pathakon ko acchhee tarah se pahachaanata hum
 Pawan Kumar may not know you, that's why a journalist came with a bag of expectations on his shoulder
 is kahani ko padhakar mujhe apni vyathaa kii filein na bhejein
 Fight your battle alone like Pawan Kumar
 main nahin lard saktaa
 Pawan Kumar started his work and started writing on file every day against companies and organizations that contract labor
 aapatti uthaane lage
 Their objections can be judged
 nateeja yah hua ki sab kilaaf ho gaye kyonki aisa karne se mazaduron ko haq milane laga
 Crying, Pawan said that i am not afraid of transfer or suspension
 maine mazaduron kii bhalaai ke liye eemaandaaree se kaam kiya he
 No one can sack me and dismiss me
 main un aaropon ko nazarandaaz kar aaraam se us jagah par ja saktaa hum jahaan meraa tabadalaa hua he
 Pawan talks that he has met companies from his office peon to colleague and senior
 ve chapa maarane nikalate hai, chaparasi or clerk soochna de dete hai
 In his absence, Lok Adalat is set up and the grievances are disposed of in favor of companies, whereas without Adalat Labor Officer, Lok Adalat cannot be held
 teen may ko kshetreey shram ayukta karyaalay ke karmchaariyon ne un par jaanaleva hamalaa kar diya
 In this evidence, he continued to show all the reports from the medical report
 kitni bhayanak baat he ki karmchaaree apane varisht afasar kii gardan marod den
 He was transferred on Pawan's complaint
 is jagah par ve kai saal se jame hue the
 Now the transfer has stopped again
 pawan ne jab marpet kii ghatana ke khilaaf police main praathmiki darj karai to badale main bhaajapa ke sthaneey netaa ne inke kilaaf karmchaariyon ke saath marpet karne kaa maamla darj kara diya
 Why will BJP leaders file a case? If there was an incident of assault, the employees could have got it done
 pawan ke khilaaf bhartiya mazdoor sangh se jude bihar minerals mazdoor sanghathan (lohardaga) ne bhi shikaayat kii he ki pawan kumaar hindalco khan kshetra main bahari vyakti lekar gum rahe the or union banane kaa prayaas kar rahe the
 Colleagues also filed cases under the STSC Act and made complaints to companies
 jis company ne shikaayat kii he uske kilaaf pawan ne gracuty bhugtan ke ulanghan ke do karod rupee se zyaada ke maamle ujagar kiye the
 Pawan's side was not even heard and the entire file was destroyed
 ek or company kii chori ke maamle kii fil bhi gaayab kar di gai
 All these are Pawan Kumar's own side but the way the leaders of political parties are involved in this, it shows how many cars are running from this department's oil
 pawan se baat kar laga ki companiyaan bade paimaane par nunatam mazaduri kii chori kar rahi hai
 There is no minimum wage anywhere in the state
 aisa duusare rajyon main bhi ho rahaa hoga
 The labor enforcement officer investigating the case can face a penalty of zero to ten times
 agar kisi company ne kisi mazdoor ko nunatam mazaduri ke das hazaar rupee nahin diye to shram pravartan adhikari das guna tak yani ek lakh tak kaa jurmaana laga saktaa he magar zyaadaatar maamalon main paanch sau rupaye se adhik kaa jurmaana nahin lagaaya jaataa
 The Prime Minister can order to publish the list of all the penalties on the website
 isi tarah mazaduron kii gracuty kii chori kaa kissa sunakar saham gaya
 If all this is true then how dreadful is the situation
 yahi nahin bina prashikshan or suraksha ke mazaduron se visphotak saamagree kii dhulaai karai jaati he
 Pawan has made his complaint from the Ministry of Labor to the Prime Minister's Office
 pradhanmantri karyaalay ne use waapas shram mantralay main bhej diya or maamla vahiin pahunchaa jinke kilaaf shikaayat kii gai thi
 According to Pawan, the Ministry of Labor has done a probe in the matter
 pawan ne bataaya ki ve ab fasebuk par khulkar likhane lage hai
 a press conference was also held in Delhi in which Kanhaiya Kumar also attended
 pawan je en you se padhe hue hai
 His words reflect the idealism which our politics defeats in the end
 tarah tarah ke aarope lagaakar bharamaane kaa khel shuru hota he or aise adhikari ke manobal ko tod diya jaataa he
 Pawan's story is not just about an officer
 ek tantra kii he jo companiyon se milakar mazaduron ko lut rahaa he
 This story tells that the labor movement has also rotted from within
 wo baahar se mazaduron ke hit kii baat karata he, andar andar companiyon se haath mila letaa he
 i wrote this story after talking to Pawan
 or paksh ho sakate hai par aap jaanate hai ki sarkari paksh ke log itani aasaani se baat nahin karte
 Who can deny the cycle of exploitation and plunder from this story to a great extent
 tippaniyan Listening to Pawan Kumar, he felt how lonely one gets because of his honesty
 satta or samaaj donon use haashiye par dhakel dete hai
 Only the corrupt part of society claims morality and loots the debate
 jo eemaandaar hota he wo akelaa rah jaataa he
 Photocopies of documents begin to be collected, kept in the bag in the hope that some change will happen if a journalist exposes these things
 main apni ashankaon ke giraft main baitha rahaa, pawan yah kah kar jane lage ki ek din duniya badalegi
 Pawan started drawing my picture for his mother and i started thinking about you readers, really, after reading this story it seems that the world will change! i recognize you readers well
 pawan kumaar shaayad aapako nahin jaanate isiilie ek patrkaar ke paas ummiido kaa bag kandhe par lad kar chale aae the
 Do not send me the files of your agony by reading this story
 pawan kumaar kii tarah apni ladaai akele laden
 i can't fight pawan kii baton se laga ki unke daftar ke chaparasi se lekar sahakarmi or varisht tak companiyon se mili hue hai
 They go out to raid, the peon and the clerk inform
 unki anupasthiti main lok adaalat lagaakar shikayaton kaa companiyon ke paksh main nipataara kar dete hai jabaki shram pravartan adhikari ke bagair lok adaalat lag hi nahin sakati

 The jail headquarters (office of the Director General of Prisons) had 'black warrants' related to the execution of Afzal Guru, messages sent by the Union Home Ministry after the mercy petition was rejected and how much it cost during the time of keeping Afzal in jail
 Citing various provisions on disclosing the details, it has said that this may deteriorate India's relations with neighboring countries
 sharma ne un dastavejon yaa patron kii pratiyaan bhi maangi thi jo dafan ke liye jagah tay karne kii prakriya main jail vibhaag dwaara likhe, bheje or hasil kiye gaye the

 Prison officials have not considered it appropriate to answer such questions about how much Afzal spent during his stay in jail
 sharma ne kaha ki yah puri tarah anuchit he
 After all, why do they not want to share the correspondence related to the mercy petition being dismissed and then hanged? The RTI activist said that there have been many demonstrations regarding the manner in which Afzal Guru was hanged and buried

 The way the Shiv Sena was spewing fire against Rahul Gandhi through its mouthpiece Saamana, it was not possible to think that Rahul can find a way to meet ordinary Mumbaikars apart from his scheduled program
 iske baavjood apane mizaaj ke mutabik hi rahul ne tay kaarykram badla or baith gaye local train main
 Yatra amidst Shiv Sena threat, Shiv Sena threat on one side, tight security arrangements on the other side
 congress ke yuvaraj rahul gandhi ke liye chunauti thi ki mumbai main aam logon se samvaad karne kaa apana iraadaa wo kaise puraa kar paaenge
 How will he be able to meet common Mumbaikars, but Rahul is Rahul
 aam netaaon se bilkul juda, unhone iskaa rasta bhi nikaal liya
 During the scheduled meeting with the students at the Bhaidas Auditorium in Vile Parle and Ramabai Ambedkar slum in Ghatkopar, Rahul found a way to meet the common Mumbaikars
 viley parley se ghatkoper vaaya localvile parley se andheri- 1
 05 am Andheri to Dadar - 1
 29 bajedadar se ghatkoper- 1
 44 hrs, for this, Rahul made Mumbai's Lifeline Local Train, which the common people of Mumbai travel
 viley parley main chaatro se milane ke baad dopaher ek baje rahul sidhe andheri pahunche
 Took a ticket in the line and caught 1 from there
 05 baje kii fast local
 After completing the Western line, Rahul 1 pm
 29 par dadar pahunche
 In Dadar, Rahul also took out some money from the ATP and then took a First Class ticket and boarded the Central Line's vt-kalyan fast local train for Ghatkopar
 rahul dopaher ek bajkar 44 minute par ghatkoper pahunche
 The people present at the station were surprised to find Rahuraul among them
 unhen andaja bhi nahin tha ki rahul se is tarah mulaakaat ho paaegi
 It is worth noting that Andheri, Dadar and Ghatkopar are counted among the busy railway stations of Mumbai
 in steshnon se train pakadaney yaa utarane main aam mumbaikaron bhi pareshaani se jujhna padataa he, lekin rahul chehre par bagaiyr koi pareshaani dikhaae in steshnon se guzar gaye
 Congress's hand, with whom? Congress's slogan, Congress's hand with common people
 rahul kii in koshishon se lagata he wo is naare ko hakeekat main badal rahe hai
 Rahul brightened the Shiv Sena during his four-hour tour of Mumbai
 bal thakare ne shivasainikon se apil kii thi ki wo rahul ko kaala jhanda dikhaaen
 Though the Mumbai Police had made elaborate security arrangements, Rahul also repeatedly dodged the Shiv Sainiks by changing the schedule
 rahul gandhi mumbai ke daure par to yuvaaon or aam logon se milane aae the, lekin shivasena kii virodh kii dhamkee ko dekhte hue unka daura lucatipi ke khel main badal gaya
 In order to manipulate Shiv Sainiks, Rahul changed his schedule everywhere
 yahaan tak ki wo aam logon ke bich mumbai kii life line local train main bhi pahunch gaye, jiskaa shiv sena ko jaraa bhi andaja nahin lag paaya
 Regardless of the threats, Rahul reached Mumbai from Delhi at around eleven in the morning and then chose the air route from the airport to Vile Parle instead of the road
 sadak par virodh pradarshan kaa mansuba paale shivasainikon ko iskaa jaraa bhi andaja nahin tha
 From Vile Parve Heliped, he reached Bhaidas Hall as per schedule
 rahul ko viley parley se phir helicopter se helipad par pavanhans udne ko taiyaar tha, lekin rahul kaa kaafila sadak ke raste nikal padaa
 Perhaps Rahul wanted to give a message that he would not be afraid of any threat
 raste main apni aadat ke mutabik rahul ne logon se baat-mulaaqaat bhi kii
 Ticket taken in queue was still the real surprise
 rahul viley parley se andheri railway stesan pahunch gaye or vahaan tikat counter kii line main khadey ho gaye
 It was evident that his intention was to travel with the common people in local
 aisa unhone kiya bhi
 Without fear, Rahul sat in the local and changed the train from Andheri to Dadar and then from Dadar to Ghatkopar, dodging the Shiv Sainiks
 saaf he lucatipi ke is khel main rahul ne shivasainikon ko unheen ke garh main khub chakma diya
 There was a huge rush to meet
 People's love for Rahul was also seen in Huzum Mumbai
 rahul jahaan bhi gaye, unhen dekhne or unase milane ke liye logon kaa hujum umad padaa
 Especially as if the wishes of the students were fulfilled over the years
 mynagari mumbai maano rahul gandhi kaa hi intjaar kar rahi thi
 Hundreds gathered with Rahul
 desh kii aarthik rajdhani kii sadake hon yaa phir mumbai kii life line local train
 The caravan of supporters of Congress's Yuvraj looked desperate to get along with Rahul
 chaatro ke bich thi kuch seekhney kii lalakarahul se kuch seekhney ke liye chaatr bade baichaiyn najar aae
 After reaching Mumbai from Udankhatole at 11 am, Rahul arrived at Bhaidas Hall in Vile Parle where a large group of management students were in Intezar to meet him
 kareeb ek ghante tak chaatro se mulaakaat hui
 After the meeting, the wishes of all the students were fulfilled
 rahul kaa yuva glamer sabake sir chadhakar bol rahaa tha
 First of all, we are Bharathiyahul, while meeting him, he also said that though you belong to any state, but first of all we are Indians
 rahul gandhi congress ke mahasachiv jarur hai, lekin ye chaatr to rahul ko lekar bade sapane paale baithe hai
 There is an atmosphere of enthusiasm in the Congress from Rahul Gandhi's journey by local train
 congress netaa rajeev shukla ne kaha ki rahul kii yatra ke baad shivasena alag-thalag pad gai he
 There were also incidents of sporadic protests after the exit of Rahul Gandhi's Bhaidas Hall, Shiv Sainiks burnt effigy of Rahul Gandhi and shouted slogans against Rahul Gandhi
 udhar shivasena ne ghatkoper main rahul gandhi ke khilaaf naare lagaae or pradarshan kiya
 Shiv Sena held a black flag in his hands
 is dauraan kai shivasainikon ko giraftaar bhi kiya gaya
 Meanwhile, senior Congress leader Kripa Shankar Singh has said that if the Shiv Sena creates a ruckus, we will not sit silent and respond to it
 rahul gandhi ke local train se yatra karne or dadar main rukkar atm se paisa nikaalane ko lekar varisht congressi netaa rajeev shukla kaa kahana tha ki rahul gandhi ne mumbai kii yatra kar shivasainikon ke bhram ko tod diya he
 Thackeray's decree is meaningless that Bal Thackeray has issued a decree that the Congress prince in Mumbai will be welcomed with black flags, and Shiv Sainiks do what Bal Thackeray says
 mumbai sabaki he kaa ek bayaan shivasena ke liye kaaphi tha rahul gandhi par nishaanaa saadhane ke liye
 The party did the same

 He said, "youth also matters as viewers at the box office

 ab sibiai na sirf is ghotaale kii jaanch karegi balki is ghotaale se judi un 47 mauton kii bhi jaanch karegi, jisane is ghotaale ko ab tak kaa sabase bada khooni ghotaalaa bana diya he
 One of these is the death of Aaj Tak's writer Akshay Singh
 ek bada sawaal yah he ki akshay kii maut se jude jin sawaalon kaa jawaab postmortem report nahin de pai, kya visra report un sawaalon kaa jawaab de paaegi?postmortem reportkuch bataa nahin rahi or visra report maheene bhar se pehle nahin aani he
 Even if the report has come, it is difficult to say that the Viscera report will actually solve the riddle of the death of Akshay
 sunanda pushkar kii maut kii vajah visra report par hi ataki he
 All the top forensic experts and FSL labs in the country have already said that they do not have the facility or technology to know which poison was given and in what quantity if Sunanda died of poisoning
 unke haath khadey karne ke baad hi sunanda kaa visra jaanch ke lieembai lalmerica bheja gaya he
 Now in such a situation, the question arises that can the investigation report of Akshay's viscera really shed light on the cause of death? Suspicion is arising because institutes like AIIMS have taken up the investigation of Visra, citing lack of facilities
 isi ke baad ab visra ko jaanch ke liye rohinee ke ennesail main bheja gaya he
 Doctors in Jhabua's government hospital did not reveal the cause of death in the post mortem report, but after the death, Akshay's heart size was definitely larger than normal
 aisa kyon, kis vajah se or kin halaat main hua, report main iskaa khulaasa nahin he
 Instead of giving the exact cause of death, the doctors have asked for two separate tests of Visra and reach the final result only after the report of his investigation
 inamen se ek jaanch dil se sambandhit he
 While the second investigation is to find out if the death of Akash was due to poison? AIIMS refused to carry out the investigation related to the poison
 jiske baad ab yah jaanch rohinee forensik lab main ho rahi he
 Now the question is that when the cause of the death of Aakshya is completely stuck on the report, will the Visarra report really be able to give the exact reason for the death? It is also important to know that there are many types of poison, which is not possible in any lab in the country
 aise me maan lijie ki agar akshay kii maut aise jehar se hui ho jisaki jaanch apane desh main mumkin hi nahin to phir sach baahar kaise aayega?amsmen jari jaanch se yah pataa chal saktaa he ki kya sachmuthakshay kii mautdil kaa daura padane se hui? or kya akshay ko pehle se dil k koi beemaari thi? maut kii sahi vajah saamne aae iske liye donon jaanch report kaa saamne aana jaruri he
 Talking about medical science and especially toxicology, poison science, the circumstances in which Akshay's death cannot be taken out of doubt
 aconite, pili kaner, safed kaner, digitalis parcura jaise kai paudhe or vanaspatiyaan hai, jinka istemaal khaane pine main jehar ke taur par kiya ja saktaa he
 Usually, after mixing it with something, the person who eats it does not even know about it and dies during half an hour to two hours
 in jaharon se aam taur par hart fail ho jaataa he, munh se jaag nikalate hai or haath-pair akad jate hai

 Will the Havana Embassy be closed? Significantly, after mounting complaints of this attack, Cuba is also once again fearing a deteriorating relationship with the US
 isi dabaav main cuba ke raashtrapati raul kastro ko america jaanch agency epabiai ko jaanch ke liye hawana pahunchane kii manjuuri deni padi
 The Cuban government is also in dire straits after the facts revealed by the investigation and Raul Castro has officially clarified that the government has nothing to do with this attack

 On the other hand, Christian organizations have condemned the event

 Here, the Gujarat government is shedding its wings over the matter
 gujarat sarkaar ke pravaktaa nitin patel ne kaha he ki unhen ab tak koi shikaayat nahin mili he
 And if we get a complaint of forced conversion, then we will consider action in this matter
 gujarat main 1999 se hi isai dharm se jude adivaasiyon ke dharm parivartan kaa maamle ne tool pakadaa hua he
 Christian organizations allege that such incidents have gained momentum since the formation of the BJP government in the state in 1995
 congress kii raajnneeti keval kursi prem ke liye he or ham iske vipareet kaam karte hai

 Modi said, 'this is what they did
 ham badlaav laae

 According to Modi, his government gave Rs 3400 crore for water related issues of tribal areas
 modi ne yah bhi kaha ki centre sarkaar pichley nau varshon main khaad utpaadan kshamta badhaane ke liye ek kilogram bhi jodne main vifal rahi
 Crediting the small and medium farmers of Gujarat for revolutionizing agriculture over the past decade, Modi said, '95 per cent of our farmers are small or medium farmers
 hamaare yahaan bade jameendaar nahin hai
 This agrarian revolution in Gujarat is due to our small farmers
 ’unhone yah bhi ullekh kiya ki unki sarkaar ne vanabandhu kalyaan yojana (adivaasiyon ke kalyaan) ke liye bajet 15 hajaar karod rupee se badhaakar 40 hajaar karod rupee kar diya he
 Conflict has increased once again between the Municipal Corporation of Delhi and the Delhi government
 isaki vajah he dilli sarkaar kaa ek order, jise beete dinon jari kiya gaya tha
 In fact, the Transport Department of the Delhi government had increased the one-time parking charge for registration during the purchase of a new car several times, but the order was canceled by the Delhi government a few days later
 ab Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) is mudde par behad aakraamak najar aa rahi he
 The municipal corporation alleged that the Delhi government had deliberately conspired to weaken it financially
 dakshini dilli nagar nigam (south Delhi Municipal Corporation) ke meyar narendra chawla kaa kahana he ki ki dilli sarkaar chaahati he ki nagar nigam or bhi kamjor ho jaae, taaki vikaas kaary thap ho jaae
 The Kejriwal government implemented the proposal and withdrew the Delhi Municipal Corporation (MCD) who sent the proposal to the Delhi government, which was put on hold by the Kejriwal government first
 phir aakhri vakt par is prastaav ko manjuuri de di gai or isi baat par dilli sarkaar ne sawaal khadey kiye hai
 Leaders in the municipal corporation are attacking the corporation itself, defending the decision of the opposition government
 vahiin dilli vaale pradooshan or trephic ke maddenjar is faisle ko sahi maanate hai
 However, while buying the first car, they are also talking about getting a discount
 dilli nagar nigam (municipal Corporation of Delhi) or dilli sarkaar main ek baar phir se takaraav bad gaya he
 The reason for this is an order of the Delhi government, which was issued in the past
 darasal, beete dinon dilli sarkaar ke transport vibhaag ne nai gaadi kharidne ke dauraan registration ke saath lagane vaala van time parking charge ko kai guna badha diya tha, lekin kuch din baad hi dilli sarkaar ne is aadesh ko radd kar diya tha
 Now Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) is looking very aggressive on this issue
 nagar nigam ne aarope lagaaya ki dilli sarkaar ne jaanboojhkar use vittiya taur par kamjor karne kii sajeesh rachi he
 Mayor of South Delhi Municipal Corporation, Narendra Chawla, says that the Delhi government wants the Municipal Corporation to become weaker, so that development work comes to a standstill
 kejariwal sarkaar ne prastaav lagu karke liya vaapasadilli nagar nigam (mcd)ne hi is prastaav ko dilli sarkaar ko bheja tha, jise kejariwal sarkaar ne pehle to hold par daal diya
 Then this proposal was approved at the last moment and the Delhi government has raised questions on this matter
 nagar nigam main netaa vipaksh sarkaar ke is faisle kaa bachaav karte hue nigam par hi hamalaa bol rahe hai
 On the other hand, Delhi people consider this decision correct in view of pollution and traffic
 haalanki pehali gaadi kharidne ke vakt chhot bhi milane kii baat kar rahe hai
 How much benefit from this? Recently, Transport Department of Delhi Government had increased the one-time parking fee up to 18 times when purchasing a new car
 beete varsh van time parking shulk se 2017-18 main purvi dilli nagar nigam ko 22 karod, uttari dilli nagar nigam ko 40 karod or dakshin dilli nagar nigam ko 47 karod rupee kaa rajasav mila tha
 In this, the corporation was expecting to increase this revenue by two to three times
 beete dinon dilli sarkaar ke transport vibhaag ne nai gaadi kharidte samay lagane vaali van time parking shulk main 18 guna tak kii badhotaree kii thi
 In 2017-18, the East Delhi Municipal Corporation received a revenue of Rs 22 crore, North Delhi Municipal Corporation Rs 40 crore and Dakshin Dillinagar Corporation Rs 47 crore from the one-time parking fee last year
 isamen nigam badhottaree karke is rajasav ko do se teen guna karne kii ummid kar rahaa tha
