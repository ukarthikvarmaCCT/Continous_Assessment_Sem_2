 australia ke olerounder mishael marsh ko khushi he ki tej gendbaaj mishael stark ne bhartiya ballebaajon ko chintit kar rakhaa he
 Stark played a key role in the first Test match by dismissing the in-form batsman Cheteshwar Pujara and captain Virat Kohli cheaply
 marsh ne duusare test match se purv samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ‘‘yah bahut acha he ki agar stark bharatiyon main dimag main ghusaa hua he
 Hopefully he will get some important wickets ahead for us
 ’’ unhone stark ko bhartiya paristhitiyon main shandaar gendbaaj qaraar diya jo reverse swing bhi hasil kar saktaa he
 Marsh said, "if he is not the best bowler in the world, then he is one of the best bowlers
" meraa maananaa he ki in paristhitiyon main jabaki spinneron ko lekar baaten chal rahi he tab bhi hamaara mukhya astr he
 He said that the ability of both Stark and Hazlewood to take wickets with the old ball has increased the confidence of the Australian team that it can put the Indian batsmen in trouble
 marsh ne kaha, ‘‘pune main wicket ne hi hamaare paksh main kaaphi kaam kiya or jaruri nahin ki yahaan bhi aisa ho
 Reverse swing will be very important for us
 ham iskaa sahi upyog kar sakate hai
 We have two bowlers who specialize in reverse swing
 ve ab bhi hamaare liye maarak hathiyaar hai
 "among the Marsh brothers, younger brother Mitchell played 76 balls on a full-blown Pune pitch and was able to do so with light hands
 unhone kaha, ‘‘yah halke haathon se khilne kii sikh se judaa he
 This allows for more avoidance from close fielders
 yahaan acha pradarshan karnaa kaaphi mahatvapurn he or is par hamaare sabhi ballebaaj kaam kar rahe hai

 Anu Malik's first film was 'hunterwali'
 put ke paanv paalane main hi dikhe or aage chal kar is chamatkaari balak ke hunter kaa shikaar hun, shaq, mongol, maane duniya bhar kaa mujeec hua
 In the Mahabharata, there was a character Sanjay who could see everything with his celestial eyes, in this age only Anu Malikahi could answer this talent
 apane divya kaanon se jinase vah sari duniya kaa mujeec sun sakate the or 'inspire' hote the
 Today is the historical date of birth of this miraculous child
 is mubarak maukey par aapke liye pesh he ye najarana
 Ten things you can learn from Birthday Boy Anu Malik
 1
 Copying requires English cassettes and good DVD players for intelligence and success
 2
 To become a music director there is no need to take a load of boring and outdated things like being a good singer and learning classical music
 3
 Little people pick something up and call it theft
 bade log uthaa le to inspireshan
 So always keep aiming to become bigger
 4
 Rukh Navjot Sidhu is also not unbeatable
 agar aap anu malik hai to apane lugdi shaayari se siddhu tak ko chup kara sakate hai
 Mane is 'possible'
 5
 The baddamiji can wash your places, the same can earn you as a judge in a realty show
 6
 Foreigners snatched our Kohinoor, but if we have Anu Malik Si Lagan, then we can snatch all their Grammy songs and Bollywoodize them
 ise kehete hai deshbhakti kii misaal
 7
 nakal sab karte hai lekin asli khel uske baad kaa he
 If someone accuses you, then say this is our tribute
 tum log itnaa bhi nahin samajhate yaar
 8
 sangeetkaar ko uthone kii kala main maahir hona chahie, lekin kabhi bhi ise for granted nahin lenaa chahie varanaa koi 'uthounikar' aakar janata kaa 'preetam' ban saktaa he
 9
 angreji ke akshar aapako naag baraabar dikhte hon to bhi chintaa na karen
 Just humming the melody of a song of Malik Saab, even the British will start to understand you as penetrating art

 in mumbai hamalon kaa mastermind jackieur rahamaan lakhvi pakistan ke rawalpindi jail main vilasitapurna jivan kaa anand uthaa rahaa he
 Not only is he provided with a mobile phone and internet inside the jail, but he also meets many visitors every day
 lashkar-e-taiyaba ke kaaryvahak commander lakhvi saal 2008 main hue mumbai hamalon ke pramukh sandigdhon main se ek he
 160 people were killed in these attacks
 bibisi urdu dwaara ravivaar ko jari ek report ke mutabik, mumbai hamale main abhyaaropit apane chah saathiyon ke saath 55 varshiya lakhvi adiyaala jail main band he
 With the approval of the jailer, facilities like a television, mobile phone and internet have been provided to him inside the jail
 jail ke ek adhikari ne kaha, 'lakhvi hafte main kisi bhi din, kisi bhi samay kisi bhi aagatuk se mulaakaat kar saktaa he
 ' adhikari ne kaha, 'usase milane vaale aagantukon ko kisi se anumati lene kii jarurat nahin he, yahaan tak ki unhen apni pahchaan jaahir karne kii bhi jarurat nahin he
 ' yah ghatana bhale hi kisi ke liye chakit karne vaali ho sakati he, lekin pakistan ke hukmran aisi manjuuri dene ke liye hi jane jate hai, kyonki unka maananaa he ki bhavishya main unhen unki jarurat ho sakati he
 Significantly, Lakhvi was declared a prime suspect in the 26 / 11 Mumbai attack by the Indian government, four days after which Pakistan arrested him on December 7, 2008
 iske chah saal baad vah ek baar phir surkhiyon main tab aayaa, jab pakistan kii ek aatankwaad rodhi adaalat ne mumbai hamale ke maamle main use jamaanat dene kaa aadesh diya
 Actress Minisha Lamba, who is excited about her upcoming film 'bheya Fry-2', feels that men are ahead in the field of comedy and in this genre, more characters are not created keeping women in mind
 minisha kaa bheja frai-2 main ek ahm kirdaar he
 He said, i think comedy is not difficult for women, but currently in comedy films more characters are not written keeping women in mind
 
 
 ye bhoomikaayen adhiktar purush pradhan hi hoti hai
 This is hoka, because men can speak many funny dialogues that do not suit women
 tippaniyan Minisha said, like some vulgar or double jokes
 
 
 mahilaayein inhen bolte hue acchhee nahin lagengi
 They exert influence only when spoken by a male artist
 'bachanaa e haseenon' main romantic, 'kidanap' main romaanchak, or 'wel dan abba' main gambhir raajnneetik kirdaar nibhaane ke baad minisha ab 'bheja frai-2' tathaa 'ham tum or shabana' ke jariye kamedi ke kshetra main haath aajamaane ja raheen hai
 Directed by Sagar Ballari, Bheya Fry-2 is a sequel to the successful film of the same name in 2007
 minisha ne kaha, maine 'bheja frai' dekhi he
 This film is completely different from the first film and its characters are new
 unhone kaha, ekmaatr meraa hi kirdaar he, jiskaa bheja bharatbhushan se frai nahin hota, meraa kirdaar uski maasoomiyat dekhtaa he or use samajhataa he
 Minisha's sent is an important character in Fry-2
 unhone kaha, mujhe lagata he kamedi mahilaon ke liye mushkil nahin he, lekin kamedi filmon main philhal mahilaon ko dhyaan main rakhkar zyada kirdaar nahin likhe jate
 
 
 These roles are mostly male dominated
 yah isliye hoka he, kyonki purush aise kai mazaakia samvaad bol sakate hai, jo mahilaon par achche nahin lagate
 The comments minisha ne kaha, jaise kuch ashleel yaa dwiarthi chutkule
 
 
 Women will not like to speak them
 purush kalakaar dwaara bole jane par hi ye prabhaav daalate hai
 After playing romantic in 'bachna Ae Haseeno', thriller in 'kidnap', and serious political roles in 'well Done Abba', Minisha now tries her hand at comedy through 'bheya Fry-2' and 'hum Tum Aur Shabana' Are going sagar ballari ke nirdesan main bani 'bheja frai-2' varsh 2007 main isi naam se bani safal film kaa sikwel he
 Minisha said, i have seen 'sent fry'
 yah film pehali film se ekadam alag he or iske kirdaar nae hai
 He said, My only character is the one who is not fryed by Bharatbhushan, my character sees his innocence and understands it
 minisha ne kaha, jaise kuch ashleel yaa dwiarthi chutkule

 duniya kaa sabase taqatvar ohada sanbhaalane ke baad ab america hi nahin, puri duniya kii najar donald trump par he
 After assuming office on January 20, Trump has overturned several key decisions by Obama
 iske baavjood chunaav prachaar ke dauraan kiye daavon par khara utarana unke liye mushkil sabit ho rahaa he
 34 promises broken on the first day! In his campaign, Trump made about 663 promises to the American public
 trump kaa kahana tha ki inamen se 36 par wo satta sanbhaalane ke pehle din hi amal karenge
 But he was able to stand the test of only 2 promises
 pehle din ke ahm faislesatta sanbhaalane ke baad trump ne pehla kaam obama ke swasthya kaarykram 'obamakare' ko waapas lene kaa kiya
 Trump has been critical of this program for a long time
 unhone isse arthvyavastha par padane vaale boj ko kam karne kaa bharosa dilaayaa tha
 In addition, Trump also signed an order banning government appointments
 iskaa makasad sarkari workforce ko ghataana he
 Promises not fulfilled, but Donald Trump did not promise to take action against drug dealers on the very first day
 unhone oktober 2016 main votaron ko bharosa dilaayaa tha ki raashtrapati banane ke pehle minute main hi wo obama ke us apravasi kanoon ko badalenge jiske tahat bina kagajaat america main rah rahe naaballig apravasiyon ko nirvasit karne ke liye 2 saal kaa vakt diya jayega
 But Trump did not take any such decision on day one
 trump ne agast 2016 main kaha tha ki wo raashtrapati kaa daftar sanbhaalane ke pehle hi ghante main aapraadhik record vaale 20 lakh apravasiyon ko america se baahar nikaal denge
 But nothing like this happened
 isi tarah donald trump pehle hi din china ke khilaaf kadam uthaane kii baat par bhi khare nahin utre
 Big decisions Despite not meeting these fronts, Donald Trump has made some important decisions during the first week at the White House
 inamen obamakare par liye faisle ke alaava trans-pacific samjhaute se haath kheenchna bhi shaamil he
 Obama signed the deal in 2015 and was considered a response to China's 'one Belt, One Road' project
 lekin trump kii raay main ye samjhauta america utpaadakon ke liye phydemand nahin tha
 At the same time, Trump has stopped funding groups that promote abortion as soon as he becomes president
 sada jivan ucch vichaar kii kahawat ko charitaarth karne vaale sipiem netaa jyoti basu kii shakhsiyat hi kuch aisi thi ki party ke netaa hi nahin virdohi bhi unka sammaan karte the
 Hardly anyone has thought that a boy born in middle-class family in 1914 would be called Lal of Bengal
 bengal kaa 5 baar mukhyamantri banegaa
 But in 1936, when Jyoti Basu stepped into the political world, Poot's feet started showing up
 haalanki shuruaati daur main unhen jabardast sangharsh bhi karnaa padaa lekin wo aage badhate rahe
 In 1946 Jyoti Basu was elected a member of the Bengal Legislative Assembly
 1964 main jab sipiai tuuti to jyoti da sipiai marxvaadi ke paulitte beuro ke nau sadasyon main shaamil the
 Jyoti Basu was elected Deputy Chief Minister of West Bengal in 1967 and 1969
 iske baad to jaise jyoti da kaa hi jamaana aa gaya
 From 21 June 1977 to 6 November 2000, Jyoti Basu served as the Chief Minister of Bengal
 1996 main aisa mauka bhi aayaa, jab har koi jyoti basu ko desh ke pradhanmantri ke taur par dekhne laga tha
 The pm's chair was also just one step away, but Deve Gowda's political moves were overshadowed and Jyoti Da continued to become Prime Minister
 raajnneeti ke dal-badalu daur kaa bhi jyoti da par kabhi asar nahin padaa
 Jyoti Da, who raised the red flag in Bengal, remained associated with the Communist Party till the last moment
 desh ke sabase charchit communist netaa basu da aaj bhale hi hamaare bich nahin hai lekin unki yaaden lakhon logon ke dilon main hameshaa taaja rahengi
 The politics of Bengal became listless
 bengal kaa siyaasi laal aisi duniya main chalaa gaya jahaan se koi laut kar nahin aata
 If i could have come, the same voice would have come from the millions of hearts of Bengal - Basu Dada, once you have seen your glimpse, you can say something to us as you go
 tii20 world cap ke liye shuukravaar ko team india kaa chayan hona he
 The team is preparing to play a series of three T20 matches with the current world champions Sri Lanka at their home after returning from a 3–0 series triumph in Australia
 australia main vanade siries ke pehle chaar maichon main haar ke baad aakhri vanade main jeet or uske baad teenon tii20 mukaable jeet kar team india ranking main number van bhi ban chuki he
 The way the pair of Raina and Yuvraj won in the last T20 match was reminiscent of the 2011 World Cup quarter-finals
 us match main bhi australia ke khilaaf isi jodi ne jeet dilaai thi
 Now while the T20 World Cup is starting on 6 March
 team main koun koun se chehre honge is par charchaa jaruri he
 It is certain that Abhendra Mahendra Dhoni will take the reins of this team while Virat Kohli will captain the sub
 in donon ke alaawarohit sharma,shikhar dhawan,suresh raina,yuvaraj singh,ravichandran asvinasrikhe khilaadiyon kaa chayan to tay hi he
 So all eyes will surely be on Rahane
 manish pandey vs ajinkya rahaneanstralia ke khilaaf tii20 siries main clin sweep ne bhale hi chayankartaaon kii mushkilen kam kar di hon lekin shuukravaar ko jab wo world tii20 or asia cap ke liye bhartiya team ke chayan ke maddenjar saatven number ke liye ballebaaj chun rahe honge to unhen manish pandey or ajinkya rahane main se ek ko chunane ke liye kaaphi mashkkat kerani padegi
 After a great performance in Australia, most of the players have made themselves contenders for the selection but only for the seventh specialist batsman will the selectors be in contention
 unhen chunanaa hoga ki kya pandey tii20 main rahane se zyada behatar honge yaa nahin
 India's number one batsman Virat Kohli has been rested against Sri Lanka, giving in-form Manish Pandey a chance in this upcoming home series
 lekin jab kohli bangladesh main asia cap ke liye team se judenge to march-april main hone vaali bade toornament ke liye srilanka siries ke liye chune gayi 15 khilaadiyon main se kam se ek par gaaj giregi
 The World T20 team is to be announced tomorrow, while Pandey is a member of Team India in the series against Sri Lanka starting in Pune on February 9
 lihaaja unka khel dekhe bina hi unhen team se baahar karnaa anyaaypurna hoga
 Nobody doubts Rahane's class but Dhoni has raised questions on his ability to take one and two runs in shorter formats
 vah australia main teen tii20 antarrashtriya maichon ke liye antim ekadash main shaamil nahin the jisase sanket miltaa he ki vah team prabandhan kii yojanaon kaa hissaa nahin he
 Yuvraj's decision to play almost against Australia in the third over of Yuvraj's exploits in the final over ensured his place in the team
 yuvaraj bade kad ke khilaadi hai or chayankarta team kaa chunate samay 2011 world cap main unke pradarshan ko nazarandaaj nahin kar sakenge
 After the T20 series, as Dhoni said the 'core team' is almost ready, there will be a slight change in the 15 players
 ek or khilaadi jinhen dhyaan main rakhaa ja saktaa he, vah irfan pathan hai jinhone saiyad mushtak ali tii20 toornament main acha khel dikhaate hue baroda ko final tak pahunchaaya tha
 He can be kept as a cover for the frequently injured Ashish Nehra
 haalanki chayankartaaon ne unhen srilanka siries ke liye shaamil nahin kiya tha isliye sawaal yahi hoga ki unhen sidhaa asia cap or world tii20 team main le jaaya ja saktaa he yaa nahin kyonki hardik pandya ne team main senior khilaadiyon ko prabhavit kiya he
 Pawan Negi is a cover for Ravindra Jadeja because Patel's batting is not completely satisfactory
 vahiin dilli ke negi aathven yaa naunve sthaan par lambey chakke jad sakate hai
 Similarly, Harbhajan Singh is being seen as a cover for Ashwin and if the Tamil Nadu bowler fails, then only he will get a chance
 bhubaneshwar kumaar chot se ubarne ke baad waapas aa gaye hai or jab bhi unhen mauka miltaa he unke ‘change aps’ prabhaavshaalee ho sakate hai

 When Mulayam Singh reached Lucknow, Shivpal Yadav first met him at home and met him for a long time
 mulaayam ne nahin diya shivpal ko thos aashwaasanasutron ke mutabik shivpal yadav ne mulaayam singh se kaha ki jis tarah se unase mantralay chhina gaya he usase unka kaaphi apmaan hua he or unhen akhilesh se baat karke is faisle ko palatwanaa chahie
 He also wanted a strong assurance from Mulayam Singh that if he was made the state president of the party, then he should be allowed to work on his own and Akhilesh Yadav should not interfere in all the work including ticket distribution
 is bich mulaayam singh yadav akhilesh se phone par baat kar chuke the or akhilesh ne bhi saaf shabdon main kah diya tha ki vah apana faisla kisi bhi haalat main palatnaa nahin chaahate
 Mulayam Singh Yadav, instead of giving any concrete assurance to Shivpal, just said that he will fix the matter and he should continue working as a minister and president
 shivpal yadav ko yah katai manjuur nahin tha ki kamjor mantralay ke saath vah akhilesh kii cabinet main mantri ban kar baithen
 Mulayam Singh also advised Shivpal to meet Akhilesh

 amar singh ke bachaav main shivpal ne yah bhi kaha ki amar singh ko party main laakar saansad kisi or ne nahin balki khud mulaayam singh yadav ne banaaya he
 But the tensions of uncle nephew increased so much that after just 15 minutes of meeting Shivpal Yadav came out and announced his resignation from the post of Chairman and Minister
 pehali baar aisa hua he ki jab party ke bheetar kii khinchataan ko kaabo paane main mulaayam singh yadav bhi apane aap ko bebas paa rahe hai
 It is believed that if the Mulayam Singh Yadav fails to manage the situation within a day or two, then the party will have difficulties in the assembly elections
 bhai or bete ke bich fanse netajibt jab mulaayam singh tak pahunchi to unhone shivpal ko samajhane kii koshish kii lekin tab tak tir kaman se nikal chukaa tha
 As news of his resignation spread, supporters of Shivpal Yadav gathered outside his house late at night and Shivpal Yadav started shouting slogans of struggle
 baahar aakar shivpal yadav ne apane samarthakon se sirf itnaa kaha ki vah ghar jaaen or shuukravaar ko un logon se baat karenge
 On the one hand, between the brother and the son on the other side, as much as Mulayam Singh Yadav is seen, he is never helpless

 # Correction: 4 miscreants opened fire at a gym in Delhi's Indrapuri area & pelted stones at it around 8:30 pm yesterday

 During the incident, a 6-year-old child was shot from the balcony of the house on the second floor of the gym
 iske alaava gym maalik ke bhai ko bhi goli lagane kii jaankaree saamne ai he
 Arson and stone-pelting were also attempted during the quarrel
 mritak maasoom ke parijanon kaa ro-rokar bura haal he
 He says what a mess his child had done to someone who made that innocent a victim of a bullet
 jhagada kyon hua iskaa philhal pataa nahin chal paaya he
 Police is pushing till late in the night to search for the accused

 Here is my meeting with elections, i hope this will change in my lifetime
 mujhe is baat kii raahat he ki mere liye jis tarah keapshabdonka istemaal kiya gaya, unako sunne ke liye mere mata-pita jinda nahin hai
 i came not to power or power in electoral politics, but to serve a city that has been my home for 40 years, a city where i have served in two different positions
 main kai chunautiyon se gujri hum - dange, virodh pradarshan, raajnneetik uthaa-patake, viipi janon kii suraksha or antarrashtriya khel aayojan, acha or bura har anubhav
 When i was on the crime front, there was a panic attack on Delhi from outside and i have gone through it
 vardi pahane or goonjte wireles ke saath jo kisi bhi samay sadak par baahar aane kaa aadesh de detaa tha, un barason main ek jhapai tak ke liye tarasi hum
 i ended the crime by rescuing women from rape in rural areas, i did not have policemen to patrol the village in the dark nights
 iske liye maine gramin yuvaaon ko gasht main lagaaya
 i myself stayed outside 5 nights a week
 maine asian khelon main hajaaron chaatro ke saath yatayaat kii vyavastha dekhi wo bhi tab, jab mere kuch senior log mujhe baahar kaa rasta dikhaane ke liye ek course karne ke liye japan bhejnaa chaahate the
 For some of them, traffic arrangements were a means of earning
 ek or baar jab ek jile main sharaab kii taskari joro par thi maine sharaab taskari kaa safaya kiya or prabhavit logon kaa punarvaas kiya 
 
 
 
 yaa phir kooda-binane vaale bacchon ko skool bheja
 
 
 
 yaa police steshnon se nasha-mukti centre khole jo pehle kabhi suna bhi nahin gaya hoga
 All this had become a lifelong campaign and will continue
 
 
 maine yah sab kisi badai ke liye nahin kiya, balki isliye kiya ki seva or sthitiyaan aisa karne kii maang karti thim
 i got into electoral politics because i wanted to give what i still had to my city
 dilli ko jis cheez kii jarurat he uske liye main chaahati thi ki shahar ko ek sthir sarkaar mili jo centre sarkaar ke saath milakar kaam kare
 i also wanted me not to die with the guilt that i always kept commentary and never showed the courage to take the electoral exam
 main pariksha main fail ho gai or main apane faisle kii puri jimmedaari leti hum
 But my conscience has not failed
 is tarah ki pariksha kii ghadiyon main chunautiyon akeli nahin aati, dher sari or chizein bhi mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaati hai or har ek ne nibhaai bhi
 i do not want to say anything else
 itihaas aakhir tak vishleshan karata rahegaa
 On the question of elections, i would like to say that we need to review the campaign
 prachaar main puraa shahar yaa rajya thahar sa jaataa he, kya ye hona chahie?sadaken avyavasthit ho jaati hai, kaam-dham ruk jaataa he
 Everything becomes noisy and at times rude, false, biased, corrupt, unreasonable, all law breakers and wrong messengers
 yah barabari kaa muqabla nahin he
 It is a counter to money and force in every way
 hamen inkaa samaadhaan sochna hoga, mujhe ummid he ki mere jeevankaal main hi main ye dekhuungi
 People want public services to be given
 log satyanishtha, vishwaas or peshewar samparn chaahate hai
 People want plans to be implemented
 lekin logon ko fokat main bhi chahie
 
 jitna zyada fokat main denge utana zyada paaenge
 They do not believe that nothing is found in life
 agar aap ek se chhinakar duusare ko denge to sabase chhin jane main zyada vakt nahin lagegaa
 Also, the entire campaign should be legal, transparent, factual, based on evidence, civilized, organized, and more technical, fair and neutral
 dharmik sabhaaon dwaara logon ko 'apil' kii anumati nahin di jaani chahie or ise kanoon kaa ulanghan maanakar is par pratibandh lagaana chahie
 The time has come that every public servant should become a partner in the governance of the country
 bijli-pani-naukari-yatayaat-shikshak-doctor har cheez ke liye logon kii aavashyaktaaen desh jo de saktaa he usase kahin aage nikal gai hai
 Forget about female safety
 
 
 bhagwaan hi jaanate hai ki aakhri kab tak mahilaayein bhugatti rahengi
 Finally, i would like to thank all those who expressed confidence in me
 or saath hi unako bhi jinhone mujhe harsambhav apshabd se sambodhit kiya
 i feel relieved that my parents are not alive to see all this

 ’’ Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) President Amit Shah on 9 September, while dismissing the declining growth rate of the economy in the FICCI program in Delhi as a technical matter, at the BJP headquarters at 11 Ashok Road at the same time, the party over inflation
 Were looking for a way to avoid being criticized
 udhar shah, fikki ke manch se vikaas main aae tehraav ke aankade ko nazarandaaj karne kii salaah de rahe the to rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ke aarthik muddon se jude aadha darjan aanushanbik sanghathan sarkaar kii aarthik nitiyon ke khilaaf raily nikaalane kii yojana taiyaar karne main lage the
 The Modi government is in the grip of criticism across the country on the economic front
 isaki chatapataahat saaf dikh rahi he
 The reason is clear that under the leadership of Modi, claims were being made to reach the peak of the economy and leave China behind in GDP growth rate
 mantri or party ke netaa notebandi or jiesti ke 'phaayde' ginate nahin thakte the
 The victory in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections was termed as the seal of the public on demonetisation
 khud pradhanmantri narendra modi ne swatantraaa diwas par laal kile se iske bataae
 But by revealing the number of old notes deposited in the bank, the Reserve Bank exposed the reality as if
 haalanki isse pehle hi report aa gai thi ki isaki vajah se kitni naukariyaan chali gayi or vyapaar, khaskar anaupchaarik kshetra ko kitna bada dhakka laga he
 The GST worsened the situation even before the impact of demonetisation was over
 iskaa ehsaas bhaajapa netaaon ko bhi ho gaya or uneliye maano achaanak sthiti badal gai
 The faces of the ministers wither away, the claim was avoided and the BJP had to admit that the situation was becoming unfavorable in political terms
 natijatan, 25 sitambar ko dilli main hone vaali rashtriya kaarysmiti kii baithak main party ke itihaas main sambhawatah pehali baar sabhi saansadon, vidhayakon or yahaan tak ki rajyon kii vidhaan parishad ke sadasyon ko bhi charchaa ke liye bulaayaa gaya he
 In the National Working Committee, the most focused focus will be on the economic proposal
 vitt mantralay, petroleum or krishi mantralay se aankade mangaaye gaye hai
 The proposal is being prepared under the supervision of Finance Minister Arun Jaitley
 iske baad bhaajapa adhyaksh shah pradhanmantri modi se charchaa kar aarthik prastaav ko antim rup denge
 This meeting of the National Working Committee of the BJP was to be held earlier in Andhra Pradesh
 isi saal may main bhubaneshwar (odisha) main isaki ghoshnaa aupchaarik rup se kii gai thi
 The name of Visakhapatnam or Vijayawada was suggested for the working committee
 lekin, pichley maheene achaanak tay kiya gaya ki kaarysmiti dilli main yojit kii jaaegi
 Sources say that in the last few months the economic policies of the Modi government have come under widespread criticism across the country, it has increased the concern of BJP
 is saal gujarat samet teen rajyon main vidhansabha chunaav hai
 There are elections for major states like Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan next year
 2019 main loksabhaa chunaav main bhi sirf dedh saal bache hai
 In this case, only working committee will not work
 is tarah kii baithak main mahaj teen- saadhe teen sau party padaadhikari shaamil hote hai
 Therefore, a plan was made to make all public representatives aware of the economic situation on the pretext of working committee
 aanan-fanan andhra pradesh kii jagah dilli main hi rashtriya kaaryaparishad bulaai gai
 Questions are being raised on all sides about the rising prices of petrol and diesel, declining industrial production, declining GDP, demonetisation and the questionable success of GST
 in sawaalon kaa thos uttar na to bhaajapa saansadon ke paas he, na vidhayakon ke paas, na hi vidhaan parishad ke sadasyon ke paas
 Above all, the ministers of the Modi government are providing more opportunities to critics with their statements
 bhaajapa mukhyalay main baithe mahasachiv jab kaaryakartaaon ko phone kar sammelan, seminar, paricharchaa yojit karke modi sarkaar kii uplabdhi bataane kaa aagrah karte hai to kaaryakartaaon kii ore se aarthik morche par modi sarkaar kaa bachaav karne ke tark puche jane lage hai
 The party officials going to the discussion are also calling the general secretaries to tell some facts on the basis of which their government can be defended
 aarthik mudde par ho rahi chhichhaledar charchaa main is kadar ja pahunchaa he ki party ke padaadhikari bhi ek-duusare se isi mudde par haas-parihaas tak karne lage hai
 For example, who would create a bullet in the inflation witch? In order to become famous in the media, the ministers who are in the queue to make a statement, are discussing the BJP officials with each other
 soshal media par bhi aarthik masale par bhaajapa baikfoot par dikh rahi he
 The party is worried about the government's pullout on this platform
 bhaajapa kaaryakarta bhi sakate main hai ki soshal media ho yaa tivi tok sho, saarvajanik manch yaa gali-nukkad, virodhiyon ko kya jabaav diya jaae
 During the demonetisation, the confidence with which the opposition was beating the dust has now come to avoid the question arising on the same issue
 anaupchaarik baatcheet main bhaajapa ke saansad or vidhayak yah khulkar sweekaar karte hai ki kshetra kii janata ko aarthik mudde par jawaab dekar santusht karnaa kathin he
 This is a bitter truth that is tarnishing the image of the Modi government
 aarthik maamle aise hai jiskaa vyapak asar samaaj ke har tabake par padataa he
 Housewives, businessmen, farmers, laborers, students and the middle class are all over the discussion that the pace of inflation is more than anything else
 bhaajapa ke ek mahasachiv kaa kahana he ki rashtriya kaarysmiti main isliye sabhi saansadon, vidhayakon or vidhaan parishad sadasyon ko bulaayaa gaya he taaki ve kaarykram main pradhanmantri ke bhaashan ko sunen
 People's trust in the Prime Minister remains intact
 aise main mahangaai rokane ke liye unki ore se jo bhi upaay bataae jaaenge, log us par bharosa karenge
 The economic proposals that will be passed in the light of Modi's speech will be a document that will answer sharp questions related to inflation, demonetisation, GST
 party padaadhikari bhi aarthik prastaav par maathapai kar rahe hai or ve aisa beja nahin kar rahe hai
 The matter is serious because more than opponents on economic policies — the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh organizations — have opened a front that winds are blowing on the faces of BJP leaders
 sangh ke kaaryakartaaon ke bare main mana jaataa he ki unka aam logon se zyada vaasta hota he or ve unki bhaawanaaon ko behatar samajhate hai
 This is why his advice is preferred in the BJP
 bhaajapa ke liye sthiti bilkul karela upar se neem chadha kahawat jaisi he
 Here, BJP people are trying to get out of the criticism on the economic front, while half a dozen organizations associated with the Economic Cell of the RSS accused the Modi government of being anti-worker, on November 17 to take out a rally of 5 lakh people
 Has announced in sanghathanon ne baithak kar aarthik morche par modi sarkaar ke prati niraashaa jataai he
 a similar rally was also organized by the Dattopant Thengdi-led Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS) against the Vajpayee government (NDA-1)
 vaajapeyi sarkaar ne us raily ko tavajjo nahin di thi or khamiyaja bhaajapa ko bhugatna padaa tha
 The special thing is that in the meeting of the National Executive of BMS held in Ranchi between 11 to 13 August, in which the decision to take out a rally of 5 lakh people against the Modi government, the association's co-sarkaryavah Dattatreya Hosabale was also present
 hosbale bhartiya majdoor sangh ke sangrakshak bhi hai
 Meaning, the Sangh also agrees about this rally
 sangh ke aarthik prakoshth se jude sabhi aadha darjan sanghathan bhartiya majdoor sangh, bhartiya kisaan sangh, laghu udyog bharti, swadeshi jaagran manch, graahak panchayat or sahakaar bharti ke binar tale dilli ke ramlila maidan main badi raily nikaalenge
 The aggressiveness of the rally can be gauged from the fact that the BMS Congress is also considering inviting the workers' organizations associated with the Left parties to the rally
 bmes se jude logon kaa kahana he ki jo bhi sanghathan majdoor ke hiton ke liye kaam kar rahe hai or raily main shaamil hona chaahate hai, unka swaagat he
 BMS general secretary Birjesh Upadhyay says, "the workers also supported the BJP in the 2014 elections
 lagbhag 50 karod mazdooron ko ummid thi ki modi sarkaar pichley 70 saal se chali aa rahi shram kshetra kii visangatiyaan dur karegi
 But it has been proved that labor is not in the priority of the government
 ham raily isliye kar rahe hai kyonki mazdooron kii sthiti abhi tak demand karne waalon kii thi lekin raily ke jariye ham sarkaar se demand karne kii jagah sarkaar ko cmand karne vaale ban saken
 "people associated with these organizations say that last May, when the BJP started shouting slogans without any consideration of our demands and problems that together, i believe, there is development going on, we prepared a plan for the rally
" 50 karod mazdooron ko saath liye bina saath he
 
 
 Like slogans have no meaning
 50 karod mazdooron main abhi tak 93 fisadi asangathit kshetra main hai
 Only 7 percent are in the organized sector
 in 7 fisadi main bhi 67 fisadi contrennt par hai, regular nahin hai
 These organizations say that the Contract Labor Regulation and Abolition Act was enacted in 1970
 niyam ke mutabik, sthaayee prakruti kaa kaam contract vaale logon ko nahin diya ja saktaa he
 But the government itself is violating it

 mangalvaar ko loksabhaa main chidambaram ne yah aashwaasan diya ki monsoon ke turant baad rajya main chunaav karaaen jaaenge or iske saath hi rajya main raashtrapati shashan ko agle chah maah ke liye badhaane ko bhi manjuuri de di gai
 At present, the chances of government formation are slim, currently there are 9 members in the 81-member Jharkhand Legislative Assembly while many other mlas are facing disqualification proceedings of the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly
 duusare shabdon main kahen to kendriya grih mantri kii ghoshnaa rajya main ek nai sarkaar kaa gathan karne kii jhamumo or nirdaleey vidhayakon kii maang par viraam laga detii he
 Those willing to form a government in the state were willing to seek support from these independents
 is aashwaasan ke baad ab rajya main sarkaar ke gathan kii koi sambhaavna nahin bachati
 Waiting for election dates, Chidambaram has made clear the Congress's stand on this issue with this announcement
 chidambaram ne sansad main kaha, ''rajya main raashtrapati shashan ko or chah maah ke liye badaye jane ke prastaav ko paarit karne ke turant baad main chunaav ayog se jharkhand main vidhansabha chunaav kii taarikh tay karne kaa anurodh karuunga
 "the Congress is fearful of a deteriorating image
 The Congress leadership was reluctant to directly support any alternative government in the state and this was not enough
" haalanki rajya congress ke kai vidhayak satta kaa swaad chakhne ke liye aay se adhik sampatti ke maamle main fanse paanch nirdaleey vidhayakon kaa samarthan lene ke liye bhi taiyaar the
 But the central leadership of the party did not like the idea and felt that it would damage the party's image
 19 janvari se raashtrapati shashan lagugauratlab he ki tamaad vidhansabha seat ke upachunaav main shibu sorain kii haar se unhen mukhyamantri pad chhodana padaa tha, jiske baad rajya main rajnatik asthirataa kaa maahaul paidaa ho gaya
 President's rule was imposed on 19 January
 sorain jhamumo ke netritv vaale upie gathbandhan kii aguai kar rahe the
 After his resignation, there was no consensus about his successor in the UPA
 jharkhand kii 81 sadasyeey vidhansabha main (loksabhaa chunaav ke baad jiske sadasyon kii sankhya ab 73 he) main jhamumo ke 17, congress ke 9, rajd ke 7 sadsy hai
 The support of 37 mlas is necessary to form a government in the state
 raashtrapati shashan ke khilaaf bole mundaavhin, loksabhaa main hui bahes main rajg ne jharkhand main apane netritv ko lekar sthiti saaf kar di he kyonki party ne rajya main raashtrapati shashan ke khilaaf bolne ke liye arjuna munda ko utaara
 Munda stood on the occasion and spoke fiercely against President's rule
 unhone kaha ki centre par bharosa karnaa mushkil he kyonki centre ne goa ke maamle main raashtrapati shashan kii avadhi ko badhaakar chunaav karaane ke apane vaade ko tod diya tha
 Law and order in the state, Dvastmunda said, "there is a reason for doubt here, extending the period of President's rule in the state is politically motivated
 ham rajya main vidhansabha chunaavon kii ghoshnaa tatkaal chaahate hai
 Everyone knows what has happened in these six months
 raashtrapati shashan ke dauraan kanoon-vyavastha puri tarah dhwast ho chuki he or vikaas bhi aundhe munh gira he
 He alleged that the intention of the state governor Saeed Sibte Razi was also not in the interest of the state
 rajya ke purv mukhyamantri or rajya main bhaajapa ke sabase bade adivasee netaa arjuna munda aagaamee vidhansabha chunaav main rajya main party kii aguai karenge or munda ko ummid he ki party bahumat hasil kar legi
 In the Lok Sabha elections, party workers are very excited with Munda's leadership winning 8 out of 14 seats in the state
 bhaajapa kii hi tarah rajya anya rajnatik dalon ne bhi chunaav ke maddenjar sargharmiyon ko tej kar diya he
 Dependence on Independent mlas Dangerously in the current Assembly, Independent mlas have often played the game of forming and toppling the government as the Chief Minister of the state always had to walk on the edge of the sword with a very short majority, and this support would come from independents only
 Was
 pakshpaat or bhedbhaav ne aam janata ko bhramit karke rakh diya or janata kii puri tarah se andekhi ho rahi thi
 Now assembly elections can be held anytime in Jharkhand, and it is expected that the voters of Jharkhand will not make a hung assembly in the state this time and independents will have no bargaining power
 anischitataaon se bhari raajnneetiyah yaad rakhana chahie ki raajnneeti anischitataaon se bhari he kyonki jharkhand ke rajnatik paridrishy main sudesh mahato or babulal marandi sareekhe kai kshetreey kshatrap hai jinaki acchhee-khaasi pakad he
 In such a situation, it is not difficult that history repeats itself
 beshak rajya ke matadaata is tarah kii sambhaavnaaon se har haal main bachanaa chaahate hai
 Nothing can be said about the politics of Jharkhand
 agar aap jharkhand main hai to yahaan dhairya bahut hi kaam aane vaali cheez he

 "bankers say that non-employed people with irregular income are more likely to become defaulters

 "there are no people in India who are not paying home or car loans," says Arun Thakral, CEO of Credit Information Bureau (india) Ltd or CIBIL, about 12 years old
 ’’ yah beuro bainkon se karj lene vaale sabhi karjadharakon kaa record rakhata he
 All such borrowers are awarded between 300 and 900 points, those who score 900 are considered to have the best payment behavior
 is ank kii madad se karj dene vaale nae bank yaa form ko kisi company yaa vyakti ke karj chukaane ke vyavhaar kaa andaja lagane main madad milti he
 Thakral states that Indians do not take loans to the extent that the people of America or Britain
 unka kahana he ki un deshon main karj par nigaraanee rakhane vaala dhaancha bahut viksit he, vasuuli kaa tantra bahut badhibia he or karj lene vaale apni bhul sweekaar karne ke maamle main kaaphi maior hai
 Says Bandyopadhyay, "in the post-2008 era, we all have heard so many stories that people leave their cars on the road or leave their flats to return to the banks
 ’’ lekin earsiiel ke rudran kaa kahana he ki unhen bharat main kam se kam nikat bhavishya main aise vyavhaar kii ummid nahin he
 The Credit Information Bureau, or CIBIL, is still struggling to set up many such institutions to get a true picture of debt behavior
 sybil kii sthapana ke das saal baad jaakar maharashtra ke chaar sheersh sahakaari bank sangh isse jude hai
 "leaders sell a debt waiver, teaching farmers not to return loans to banks," says an officer of a non-banking finance company traveling extensively in rural India
 ’’ bank kisaanon ko karj dene ke maamle main chaukas rahete hai kyonki is segment main karj na lautaane kaa puraa itihaas he
 Sanjay Agarwal, group head of retail business at ARCIL, says that there is a tendency in India that people resort to litigation to thwart the recovery process
 udhaaharan ke liye earsiiel ne jaise hi ek bank kaa enpie kharida, karjdharak court pahunch gaye or unhone is asset transfar ko chunauti di
 "there are many cases that have been unresolved for more than eight years," says Rudran of ARCIL

 You have to find new ways to deal with vicious borrowers
 ’’ unhone kaha ki difalter karj na chukaane ke liye koi bhi bahaanaa nahin chhodte or court kaa darwaja khatkhataakar vasuuli ko baadhit karne kii koshish karte hai
 "the borrowers also try to pressure the influential people indirectly," says an official of the NPA department in the state-run bank
 ’’ unke bank ko iske liye bahut se netaaon ke phone aate rahete hai
 "most cases of corporate default are settled only through court," says Deepak Gupta, one of the joint mds of Kotak Bank — one of the few banks specializing in purchasing npas of other banks
 ’’ karj dene waalon kii bahutayat bhi karjadharakon ke kharaab vyavhaar kii ek vajah he
 Apart from banks, lenders also have a range of nbfcs, microfinance institutions, district cooperative banks, regional rural banks and many non-registered sources

 Banks put credit bureau reports at the top of the checklist in terms of lending
 thakaraal kehete hai, ‘‘bure karjadharakon ko agar koi nayaa lone na mili to halaat main sudhaar aa jayega
 "as the role of credit reports increases, many businesses are also seeing opportunities in this
" mumbai ke do udhyamiyon ne credit sudhaar kii ek form banaai he
 This new company advises people to improve their credit score

 "the benefits of being a good borrower", says Thakral, are a sign of increased awareness that many borrowers often come to the CIBIL office or call the helpline to discuss their negative reports
 thakaraal ne kaha, ‘‘bharat kii saanskrithik bunaavat pashchim se kaaphi alag he
 Our parents and grandparents have often been instructing this: as many sheets should be spread as possible
 ’’ samay par karj chukaana kai tarah se phydemand he
 a European bank working in India asked job applicants to submit their credit reports before hiring them
 apana naam na jaahir karne ke anurodh par privet company main kaam kar rahe ek profeshnal ne bataaya ki unke dost jab apane beti kaa admician dilli ke ek public skool main karaane gaye to unase unki credit report talab kii gai
 Now the chances of hiding the vicious debt holders are constantly decreasing
 ghar ke daravaaje par taala laga dena yaa kisi or shahar chale janaa ab kaam nahin aane vaala he
 So now it is time to check your credit score

 On November 20, in Uttar Pradesh, the water of the Kashi Hindu University (BHU) was burnt on sight
 biechayu kaa maamla abhi thama bhi nahin tha ki 25 november ko jaipur main chaatr sangh radd kiye jane par gussa foot padaa
 However, on 5 December, the division bench of the High Court gave a stay order on the decision to cancel the student union elections and the university administration is about to restore the student union
 isse pehle hycourt ne rajasthan vishvavidhyalay main chaatr sangh ke chunaav ko radd kar diya tha kyonki police ne apane halafname main chunaavon main lingadoh cameti kii siforeeshon ke ulanghan kii baat kahi thi
 Students and administration clashed fiercely against this
 aisa hi kuch haal bihar main patna vishvavidhyalay or magadh vishvavidhyalay kaa he
 Students union elections were held here in December 2012 after nearly 28 years
 uske baad disambar, 2013 main chunaav hone the, jo ab tak nahin hue hai
 Elections have not been held in nine universities of the state so far
 chaatr sanghathanon or vishvavidhyalay prashasan ke bich is baat ko lekar takaraav kaayam he
 On the other hand, there was fierce clashes during the student union elections in Allahabad on 21 November and again in Meerut in the last week of November
 isse pehle agast main himachal pradesh main chaatr sangh pratibandhit karne par chaatro kaa pradarshan ho chukaa he
 Reasons for the recent conflict This year, after Narendra Modi took power, there was a lot of excitement among the students of BHU about the student union and during the last three months half a dozen memorandums were sent from the University Administration to the Ministry of Human Resources
 pichley dinon jab maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantri smriti irani biechayu ai thim, to kuch chaatraon ne unka bhi gheraav kiya
 But suddenly the university administration announced the election of the student council in the second week of November, which has been adopted as an alternative arrangement of the student union
 18 november ko jaise hi vibhaagon main namakan patron kaa vitaran shuru hua, chaatro ne andolan tej kar diya
 On 20 November, after the police failed to understand the agitating students lathi-charged the students, the students became furious and the campus got burnt
 pulisia karrwai kii gunj dilli tak pahunchi or jawaharlal nehru vishvavidhyalay chaatr sangh (jeenuasu) samet anya chaatr sanghathanon ne maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantralay ke saamne pradarshan kiya
 The background of nuisance in BHU is not new
 janvari, 1997 ko biechayu parisar main chaatr sangh ke dauraan jamkar todfod or aagjanee hui thi
 Two students were killed in a clash between police and students
 iske baad vishvavidhyalay ne chaatr sangh chunaav ko pratibandhit kar diya tha
 The Student Council system came into force in 2007, in which the representative elected on behalf of the students is the secretary of the council and the chairman is the designated professor on behalf of the university
 chaatro ne 2012 main court se is par sthagan aadesh le liya ki isamen adhyaksh or upaadhyaksh professor hote hai tathaa chaatro kii numaaindgi nahin hoti
 (students protesting violently at BHU on 20 November to demand reinstatement of the students' union) Government and administration's game The first day of the conflict at BHU was seen between the students and the administration
 lekin duusare hi din yah sangharsh chaatro ke bich aapasi ladaai main tabdeel ho gaya
 a BHU professor, on condition of anonymity, says, "this struggle was started by some rowdy students to establish their supremacy
" biechayu pichley 7-8 varshon main prashasnic adhikariyon kii aapasi gutbandi kii sajaa bhugat rahaa he
 They not only fight with each other to establish their supremacy but also provoke the students
 '' haalia updrav ke pehle vishvavidhyalay prashasan ne ek survey ke jariye chaatro kii raay jaanane kaa daawa karte hue kaha tha ki kareeb 90 fisadi chaatro ne chaatr sangh kii bahaali ke khilaaf raay jaahir kii he
 BHU Secretary Shikha Singh of All India Students Association asks, "why did the administration not fully disclose this survey?" usne to isamen pehle hi apana faisla de diya tha ki chaatr sangh chunaav se parisar kaa maahaul bighad saktaa he
 As soon as he became the Chief Minister in 2007, BSP chief Mayawati had banned student union elections in universities under the state government
 21 march, 2014 main satta par kabiz hone ke baad sapa sarkaar ne lingadoh cameti kii siforeeshon ke aadhaar par chunaav karwaane kaa nirdesh jari kar diya
 But according to the recommendations, universities and colleges were not classified
 ucch shiksha vibhaag ke ek adhikari kehete hai, ''vargeekaran na hone kii vajah se vishvavidhyalayon or mahavidhyalayon main chunaav nahin ho paae hai
 After the defeat in the Lok Sabha elections, the SP government has started preparations for the student union elections to strengthen the base of the people from afresh
 25 november ko ucch shiksha vibhaag kii sachiv kalpana avasthi ne kai vishvavidhyalayon ke kulapatiyon ko vargeekaran karne kaa nirdesh diya
 After the Congress government came to power in Rajasthan in 2008, the student union elections were approved
 lekin usne lingadoh cameti kii siforeeshon ko lagu karne kii koi koshish nahin kii
 bjp's stance is not in favor of student union elections
 patna vishvavidhyalay main bhi chaatr sangh chunaav ko lekar vaais chancelar vaai
 C
 simhadri kaa rukh bhi sakaaratmak nahin he, ''main yahaan shaikshanik maahaul ke liye kadam uthaaungaa

 Lyngdoh's recommendations (student demonstrations against vcs in Patna University): The Lyngdoh Committee constituted by the far-flung Kourikendra government made some important recommendations (see box) in 2006 regarding the students' union
 dhan-bal, rajnatik hastkshep or hinsa ko rokane ke liye uski siforishein aaj bhi dur kii kaudi sabit ho rahi hai
 On the other hand, student organizations have also continued to demand the scrapping of those recommendations
 jeenuasu ne pichley maah dilli main iske khilaaf pradarshan kiya tha
 Says Ashutosh Kumar, president of JNUSU, "the committee, through its recommendations, spoke of stopping money-force and violence
 lekin yah chaatro ke loktantric adhikaron ke hanan kaa jariya bana hua he
 "student union elections in various universities of money, power and violence are not untouched by the game of money, power and violence
 rajasthan ke vishvavidhyalayon main adhyaksh pad par chunaav ladgaye vaale kaa anumaanit bajet kareeb do karod ru
 Is told
 unheen chizon ko dekhte hue hycourt ne kareeb saat saal pehle chaatr sangh chunaav pratibandhit kar diya tha
 Similarly, the student union election of Delhi University (DU) is considered to be ahead in the money game
 21 november ko elahabaad main hue chunaav main kaaphi updrav hua
 In November, Meerut University also got shaken by firing during the election itself
 patna vishvavidhyalay main 2013 main vaais chancelar par hamalaa ho chukaa he to biechayu main 2012 main ek professor ko jalaane kii koshish ho chuki he
 Universities are also not untouched by local politics
 patna vishvavidhyalay main pichley chaatr sangh ke adhyaksh ashish sinha bijepi saansad putr hai
 Recent demonstrations at BHU included the son of a state minister
 ummid or chunautiyambiechayu kii chaatra shivani bataati hai, ''main dar gai thi
 If the student union comes out on a violent path or creates an atmosphere of fear, then what use is it? "this is the concern of many students
" lekin elahabaad uniwarsity kii chaatr sangh upaadhyaksh nilu jaiswal kahati hai, ''chaatr sangh ke jariye chaatr apni maangon ko puraa karvaa pate hai
 Elections have been peaceful in several universities, including Aligarh Muslim University, JNU and DU
 punjabi uniwarsity, patiala ke chaatr or eiesaf ke state president sumit shami kehete hai, ''hamane bhi chaatr sangh ke liye sarkaar se maang kii he
 The Chhattisgarh government has given consent for the student union elections in the 2014-15 session and Madhya Pradesh is also positive
 biechayu main bavaal ke baad vaais chancelar bane pro
 Yes

 Tripathi has said, "I will do something in consultation with the students
" '' in sabake bich ek uljhan najar aa rahi he
 Most students want a student union in a peaceful way, on the other hand, under the guise of it, rowdy students are in the dominance of their domination

 Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Raman Singh came to attend Mail Today's Skill and Entrepreneurship Summit 2017
 unhone aaj tak ke samvaadadaata jitendra bahadur singh se naksal samasya par khulkar baat kii
 He said that the Naxalites have been ruined by the note closure
 vahiin, unhone ye bhi kaha ki naksali hathiyaar or gola barood videshon se laa rahe hai
 Read what Raman Singh said in the question and answer
 sawalnaksaliyon kochhattisgarhse puri tareeke se ol out karne ke liye jo aap oparation prahaar 1 or prahaar 2 chalaa rahe hai, usase kis tareeke kaa phayda ho rahaa he?raman singh kaa javabahamane do disha main kaam shuru kiya he
 We have adopted a policy of better development and for that big infrastructure is being set up in different districts of Chhattisgarh
 sadakon kaa nirmaan rajya main bade str par ho rahaa he
 The people of Chhattisgarh have fully worked for the people of Chhattisgarh
 vahiin, yuvaaon ke liye skill deveopment ke bhi bade kaam sarkaar ke dwaara kiye ja rahe hai
 Gradually, the common people there are connecting with development in a complete manner and it is benefiting that they are going in the other direction
 chhattisgarh sarkaar ne ek behatar sarender policy di he
 The Chhattisgarh government wants those who are Naxalites to come in the way of peace and development
 jab iske baad aavashyaktaa padati he to inter state abhiyaan chalaae jate hai, jisamen naksaliyon ko dher to kiya hi jaataa he, saath hi is dauraan agar naksali sarender karnaa chaahate hai to unako sarender karne kaa mauka diya jaataa he
 You have said that by 2022, Naxalism will be completely eradicated from Chhattisgarh
 iske liye kis tareeke ke kadam chhattisgarh sarkaar uthaa rahi he?javaabachhattisgarh ke mukhyamantri raman singh ne kaha ki jaise-jaise rajya main suraksha kii bhaavana logon ke bich main aati he sadakon kaa nirmaan hota he
 Development work is done
 usase naksal samasya puri tareeke se khatm hone kii ore badhata he
 This work is continuously being done by the Government of Chhattisgarh
 hindustan kaa akelaa ek aisa jila chhattisgarh kaa bastar he jahaan par sadakon ke nirmaan ke dauraan barudi surang fatati he, goliyaan chalati he sukama jile ke ek sadak kaa nirmaan yani 10 kilometre kii jab sadak kaa nirmaan chhattisgarh sarkaar ne kiya to usamen 12 jawan shahid hue
 Our jawans are martyred in road construction, but our jawans are determined to stay on by building roads
 savamb is tareeke kii jaankaree aa rahi he ki bastar or dandakaarany ke ilaake se naksali bhaag chuke hai
 Because big operations are being conducted there
 lekin ek nayaa tri jankshan madhya pradesh, chhattisgarh or maharashtra ke un ilaakon ke jilon main ban rahaa he jahaan naksali ruk rahe hai
 How big a challenge is this? The answer is our full effort that the government of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh together should run operations against the Naxalites trying to unite in new places
 haalanki, jo oparation bastar or dandakaarany ke ilaakon main kiya gaya he uski vajah se yahanxliyaha se dum dabaakar bhaag rahe hai
 However, if they try to stick to other places, then they will jointly operate against them
 sawalnaksaliyon ko funding kis tareeke se milti he
 However, after the demonetisation, the central government had reported that the Naxalites were completely ruined, but do these Naxalites get funding from abroad also? What information do you have on this? javaabachhattisgarh ke mukhyamantri raman singh ne kaha kii funding ko lekar jo jaankaree hamaare paas he wo funding local funding hoti he
 Funding is done through persimmon leaves
 thekedaaron se ugaahi kii funding lete hai
 They take funding by creating pressure from the transporter
 lekin naksaliyon ke paas jo hathiyaar-barood hai, vah videshon se aata he
 The money that is raised for this is raised locally
 uskaa istemaal karte hai
 After demonetisation, the money they had was buried in the ground
 vah puri tareeke se barbaad ho gaya or isse kaaphi fark bhi naksal samasya par padaa he

 manoj tiwari ke viral video par aamane-saamne bijepi or congress ke netaa aamane-saamne hai
 Aam Aadmi Party tried to surround it all over the issue of viral video of Delhi BJP President Manoj Tiwari
 soshal media par to ye video viral ho hi rahaa he, aam aadmi party bhi is mudde ko chhodane ke mud main nahin he
 This is the reason that Delhi BJP President Manoj Tiwari, who was seen talking to the media since the video went viral, has uploaded his video on Facebook itself, clarifying
 manoj tiwari abhi punjab ke daure par hai or soshal media par video kii ho rahi aalochana ke baad car main hi unhone mobile se apana ek video ricard karavaaya he or kaha he ki wo aajkal kai vajahon se charchaa main he or abaam aadmi party unka ek videoye kahkar viral kara rahi he ki unhone notebandi ke baad line main lage logon kaa mazaaq udaaya he, jabaki unhone to logon kaa utsaah badhaane ke liye kavita sunai thi
 He said that instead of arguing on the issues related to development of Delhi, Kejriwal keeps on creating disputes about unnecessary things
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki kejariwal dilli ke logon ko suvidha nahin de paa rahi he or wo khud jhuggi basti main raaten bitaakar aae hai, jahaan log badahaali main he
 a letter written by Kapil Mishra to Tiwari may be presented by Manimoz Tiwari, but Aam Aadmi Party leaders are demanding an apology
 dilli sarkaar ke mantri kapil mishra ne manoj tiwari ko ek chitthee bhi likhi he, jisamen unhone likhaa he ki tiwari ne na sirf logon kaa mazaaq udaaya he, balki besharmi se bijepi ke netaa unki baton par tahaakaa laga rahe the
 Kapil Mishra has written to Manoj Tiwari in the letter that he has done a very shameful job by mocking the poor and troubled people
 kapil mishra ne likhaa he ki manoj tiwari kamaal ke gayak he, lekin ishwar ke is vardaan kaa istemaal janata ko murkh banane ke liye na karen, aapako jitna gaanaa he, gaaie, lekin janata ko tabalaa mat samajhie
 BJP came to the rescue and on the other side BJP leader has come out in support of Tiwari
 bijepi ke rashtriya mantri sardaar aar
 P
 singh ne kaha he ki manoj tiwari ne gaanaa ga kar janata kaa mazaaq nahin udaaya balki unka utsahvardhan kiya tha or thahaake logon ne is liye lagaae kyonki tiwari kii is acchhee koshish se vahaan baithe logon kaa acha feel hua tha
 Instead of Kejriwal arguing with Manoj Tiwari on Delhi's development of giving rise to this issue, accept Tiwari's challenge and decide the time along with the place
 zaahir he viral video par bayaanbazi thami nahin he, balki is mudde par abhi siyasat or bhi garmayegi

 All kinds of colorful ashes are enticing people in small and big markets, but this time the festival is special, because this time Indian queens are more popular than Chinese ones

 While shoppers are more inclined to take Indian ash with stone-lined chords, shopkeepers are also not taking merchandise from Chinese queens

 duusare saamaanon kii tarah raakhiyon kii holcel kharidari ke saath-saath yahaan lagane vaala retail bazaar kaaphi prasiddh he or yahaan par bhi chini rakhiyaan na ke baraabar bik rahi hai
 Shopkeepers say that when there are no buyers, then what should we do by keeping Chinese goods
 haalanki, chini rakhiyaan kam hi sahi par har baar kii tarah is baar bhi bazaaron tak pahuch gai hai
 But the special thing is that people are now abstaining from buying them
 bhutan ke doklam par bharat va china ke bich vivaad ke baad desh bhar main china ke khilaaf maahaul bana hua he or log china main bane saamaanon kaa virodh kar rahe hai
 In such a situation, the festival of Rakhi is also not untouched

 isamen saaf-saaf likhaa gaya ki peedita ne pehle sahmati se shaareerik sambandh banaaya, baad main do logon ne jabaran aisa kiya

 ' The Gorakhpur and Phulpur Lok Sabha by-elections in Uttar Pradesh have an interesting twist
 bijepi ko maat dene ke liye sapa or basapa ne 23 saal puraani dushmani bhulaakar gathjod kar liya he
 At the same time, BJP has given full strength to save this seat
 soobe kii donon seat par ho rahe upachunaav ke bijepi ke siyaasi sameekaran ko dekhen to akhilesh-mayawati ke gathbandhan par party baari najar aa rahi he
 Phulpur: The SP-BSP combined with the BJP and the BJP, for the first time in the Modi wave, managed to win their victory in the Phulpur seat in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 keshav prasad maury bijepi ummidavaar ke taur par 2014 main phulpur seat se saansad bane, lekin march 2017 main upi ke dipti siem banane ke baad unhone yahaan se istipha de diya
 In view of the votes polled in the Lok Sabha elections 2014, Keshav Maurya of BJP received 5 lakh 3 thousand 564 votes out of total 9 lakh 60 thousand 341 votes
 espi ummidavaar dharm singh patel ko 1 lakh 95 hajaar 256 vot, bispi pratyaashee kapilmuni karvariyaa ko 1 lakh 63 hajaar 710 or congress ke mo
 Kaif received 58 thousand 127 votes
 bijepi ko yahaan 52 fisadi vot mili the, jabaki espi or bispi kaa vot fisadi 47 rahaa
 In such a situation, not only the SP-BSP but all the votes cast in the protest were mixed even then it was less than the vote BJP got
 isi record ko dekhte hue kaha ja saktaa he ki agar 2014 jaise vot pade to sapa ummidavaar nagendra patel bispi ke samarthan ke baad bhi jeet ke prati aashwast nahin rah sakate
 Gorakhpur: BJP, more than SP, BSP, is considered a strong fort of BJP
 1989 se ye seat bijepi ke paas he
 Yogi Adityanath resigned from the Lok Sabha membership here after becoming MP of UP last year after being an MP for the last five times
 gorakhpur seat ko bijepi se chhinane ke liye sapa or basapa ne haath milaayaa he
 Despite this, it will not be easy for the opposition
 bataa den ki 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main yogi adityanath ko 5 lakh 39 hajaar 127 vot mili the
 SP candidate Rajmati Nishad got 2 lakh 26 thousand 344 votes, while BSP candidate Ram Bhuial Nishad got 1 lakh 76 thousand 412 votes
 iske alaava congress ko mahaj 45 hajaar 719 vot mili
 In this way, along with SP and BSP, the Congress vote is 4 lakh 48 thousand 475 votes
 jo ki bijepi se 90 hajaar 652 vot kam hai
 BSP has supported SP candidate Praveen Nishad to beat BJP candidate Upendra Shukla from Yogi's Legacy seat from Gorakhpur seat
 ab dekhnaa he ki yogi ko mili pichley vot kii bharpai sapa basapa milakar kaise karte hai

 In the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly, BJP has claimed to gain confidence by voice
 navnirvaachit spikar ne bailat vot kii bajaay dhwani mat ko tarzih di
 The party took advantage of this and won the trust vote
 lekin isse kai sawaal uth khadey hue
 The finger on Fadnavis 'faith' Now we tell you the ten reasons why this belief is being mistrusted
 
 
 1
 First of all, the speaker should not have the right to resort to voice vote instead of ballot, as it was a matter of trust of a new government
 amuman aisa praavdhaan bill vagairah paarit karaane main hota he, lekin vishwaas hasil karte samay spikar dhvanimat kaa sahaara lene den, aisa shaayad hi kabhi suna gaya hoga
 2
 dhvanimat main sabase badi baat yah hoti he ki yah pataa karnaa ki kitne log paksh main hai or kitne vipaksh main, bahut mushkil he
 There was noise in the assembly too
 aise main mahaj vidhayakon kii aawaaj sunakar yah kah dena ki falaan ke paksh main zyada sadsy hai, uchit nahin hoga
 3
 bijepi ke paas bahumat nahin he or party ke saath 144 vidhayak nahin hai, yah baat party bhi maan rahi he
 After several attempts, she has not been able to cross the figure of 137
 aise main yah kahana ki uske paas bahumat he, galat hoga
 4
 bijepi ko baahar se samarthan de rahi ensipi ke sadsy agar walk out kar jate, to bhi baat ban jaati
 They were also sitting there
 kya unhone is par bilkul chuppi saadh lee thi?5
 If the speaker had to take recourse to voice, then why did he not get the party and opposition divided? This makes the situation clear how many members are there and how many are not
 6
 Faith was so hasty in proposing that no one could get a chance to think
 vidhansabha ke spikar ko yah adhikaar to he, lekin aisa karnaa naitik drushti se kitna uchit he, yah sochna hoga
 7
 spikar ne shivasena vidhayak ekanath scindia ko vishwaas mat ke pehle vipaksh ke netaa kaa pad kyon nahin diya? vishwaas mat milane ke turant baad unhen vipaksh kaa netaa bana dene se andeh gaharaa jaataa he ki unke man main kuch chal rahaa tha
 8
 ensipi ne haalanki sadan ke baahar yah elaan kiya tha ki party bijepi kaa samarthan karegi, usne sadan main aisa kuch nahin kiya or spikar ko is baat kii vidhivat soochna bhi nahin di
 9
 spikar ne apana chunaav hote hi turant vishwaas prastaav jitani teji se rakhaa or vah bhi sirf ek pankti kaa, vah bhi ajeeb-sa tha
 He did so quickly and in haste that even the leaders of the other party could not understand
 10
 Only politics appears in this entire episode
 vishwaas mat ke paarit hone kii ghoshnaa itani jaldbaaji main kyon kar di gai ki kisi ko kuch pataa hi nahin chalaa
 Ethically, this does not look appropriate
 kul milakar yah vishwaas prastaav se zyada ek tarah kii baazeegari dikhti he
 The head of Iran's Basij militia on Monday dismissed US President Donald Trump's threats as a "psychological war"
 ardhadhikarik news agency 'iesene' ke anusaar general gulam hossain geipur ne kaha, iran ke khilaaf trump ke bayaan manovaigyanik yuddh he
 He is not in a position to take action against Iran
 unhone ye tippaniyan aise samay kii jab ravivaar kotrampane hamalaa bolte hue twitor par likhaa, phir kabhi america ko mat dhamkaana varanaa tumhen vaise parinaam bhugatne padenge jaise kuch itihaas main jhele hai
 Trump's warning to Iran - don't threaten America again, or else
 
 
 
 Earlier, Iran's President Hassan Rouhani advised Trump not to 'play with the tail of a lion' and said that the conflict with Iran would be 'the biggest war ever'
 samachar agency effe kii report ke anusaar, irani rajanyikon ke ek samaaroh main ruhani ne kaha tha ki unka desh america ke saath shatruta kii shuruyaat nahin karnaa chahta, lekin vah yuddh karne se hichkegaa nahin
 Trump tweeted to Rouhani late Sunday, saying, "for Iran's President Rouhani: Never threaten America again, otherwise you will have to face consequences that no one in history has ever suffered
" ham ab vah desh nahin rahe jo aapke hinsa or maut ke ghrunit shabdon ko sun le
 So stay alert
 'to Iranian President Rouhani: NEVER, EVER THREATEN THE UNITED STATES AGAIN OR YOU WILL SUFFER CONSEQUENCES THE LIKES OF WHICH FEW THROUGHOUT HISTORY HAVE EVER SUFFERED BEFORE
 WE ARE NO LONGER a COUNTRY THAT WILL STAND FOR YOUR DEMENTED WORDS OF VIOLENCE & DEATH
 BE CAUTIOUS!— Donald J
 Trump (@realdonaldtrump) July 23, 2018 Explain that Rouhani said that working with the US does not mean surrender and ending Iran's achievements
 iran presidency kii website ke anusaar, ruhani ne kaha tha ki iran ke dushmano ko avashya yah samajhnaa chahie ki iran ke saath yuddh sabase ghaatak yuddh hoga (madar of aal vars) or iran ke saath shanti sabase behtareen shanti (madars of aal pis) hogi

 In the name of Modi, the Delhi BJP, which is trying to cross the electoral mile, has got two shocks
 pehle modi kii ramlila maidan main hone vaali raily radd hui, iske baad modi kii thri-di raily se ummid bandhi, lekin ain vakt par dilli kii nau jagahon par hone vaali yah raily bhi nahin ho paayi
 Now in the last two days of campaigning, candidates have only recourse to Modi's name
 modi kii tasviren, modi ke video
 Everything in the bjp's campaign is Modi-friendly
 lekin jab vastav main modi ke dilli aakar raily karne kii baat ai, to modi nahin aae
 The rally at Ramlila Maidan was canceled
 lekin dilli bijepi ke adhyaksh or chandani chowk se ummidavaar harshavardhan kaa daawa he ki modi nahin aae to kya hua, modi kaa naam hi kaaphi he
 Dr
 Harsh Vardhan said, Delhi residents are in the heart, Modi
 ab wo aaen yaa nahin koi fark nahin padataa
 Delhiites have decided that Modi ji will have to vote
 modi ko dil main based hone kaa daawa to kar diya, lekin somvaar kii shaam ko ek or jhatka laga
 When Modi's much-publicized 3D rally was also canceled
 is raily main modi satellite link ke jariye votaron se bijepi ummidavaaron ko jitaane kii live apil karnaa chaahate the
 Now both actual and virtual Modi did not come, even then Modi is the only hope
 isiilie dilli ke muslim bahul ilaakon ke liye bijepi ne ek video release kii he
 Through this film, BJP wants to reduce the distance between Modi and Muslim voters
 ise prachaar ke taur par alag-alag jagahon par dikhaaya ja rahaa he
 The BJP does not want to talk about Modi other than in the Lok Sabha election campaign
 kyonki party or ummidavaar donon ko pataa he ki muddon se is baar chunavi naiya paar nahin hogi
 BJP has suffered a major setback in the assembly elections in Delhi
 vipaksh ke taur par jo mudde uske paas hone chahie, unhen pehle hi aam aadmi party hathiyaa chuki he
 In such a situation, Modi's name is the only support for victory

 The moderate faction of the Hurriyat Conference rejected the latest Central Government initiative on Kashmir, saying it is disappointing as it lacks the political will to fulfill the ambitions of the people of the state
 mirwij umr faruk kii adhyakshata vaale dhade ke pravaktaa ne kaha ki centre kaa kadam sankat main ghiri rajya kii umr abdulla sarkaar ko raahat pradaan karne kii koshish he
 The spokesperson said that the all-party delegation had assessed the seriousness of the situation during his recent visit to the state but despite this the eight-point formula reflected a lack of willingness to understand and address the main issue which is disappointing
 ullekhneey he ki isse pehle saiyad ali shah gilaani kii adhyakshata vaale hurriyat conference ke kattarpanthi dhade ne centre ke is package ko khaarij karte hue ise maatr ek 'dhakosla' qaraar diya tha
 The spokesman said that peace and stability in Kashmir can only come from the resolution of Kashmir issue and not from political and economic concessions
 unhone kaha, ‘yah (package) ek baar phir rajya kii janata kii raajnneetik mahatvakanksha par dhyaan dene kii nai dilli kii aruchi ko dikhaata he jiske liye ve pichley chah dashak se andolan kar rahe hai
 'mirwaiz has once again advocated the inclusion of Pakistan to reach an acceptable solution on the Kashmir issue
 pravaktaa ne kaha, ‘hamane kashmir mudde ke samaadhaan ke liye sambandhit pakshon kashmir, bharat or pakistan kii janata ke bich saajhedaari kii ek sarthak prakriya kii pahal ke liye sarkaar ko kuch suzav diye hai
 'he said,' Suggestions are necessary to provide relief to the public on the basis of trust
 lekin hamen niraashaa he ki is bare main koi pragati nahin hui he
 The Mirwais expressed that they feel that the Kashmir package aims to divert attention from the 'real' issue

 39 Indians have been missing since 2014 in Iraq
 tamaam koshishon ke baavjood abhi tak unka koi suraag nahin mil sakaa he
 India Today Network has expanded the scope of its independent investigation in search of these 39 Indians from Iraq to the war-torn regions of Syria
 teen maheene pehle hi india today network iraq ke mosul shahar ke badush jail main pahunchaa tha
 It was believed that 39 Indians who were abducted by the terrorist organization ISIS were taken hostage here
 india today ne vahaan dekha ki jail vaali jagah malbe ke sivaa kuch or nahin bachaa tha
 Is there any possibility of people living anywhere around there? india today ke is hairaan karne vaale khulaase ke baad bharat or iraq ne sarkari str par laapata 39 bharatiyon kaa pataa lagane ke liye prayaas tej kiye
 In this regard, the Opposition had also targeted the Modi government fiercely and Sushma Swaraj had to explain in the matter in Parliament
 isi hafte,videsh rajya mantri general (ritred) wike singhlapata bharatiyon ko dhundne ke mishan ke tahat baghdad pahunche
 Singh has also taken with him DNA samples of some relatives of missing Indians
 baghdad main singh ne india today ko bataaya ki sambhavit pahchaan ke liye abhi or semple ekatra kiye ja rahe hai
 Singh said, 'the Iraqi government has asked for DNA samples for its investigation and records
 pahchaan kii prakriya ke liye inaki jarurat he
 Meanwhile, India Today Reporters, under their own independent investigation, are trying to find clues of the 39 Indians who have gone missing from place to place in the entire troubled region
 iske liye iraq main yuddh se tabah ho chuke ek shahar se le kar duusare shahar chaanaa ja rahaa he
 Not only this, this scope of independent investigation extends to the ruined Syria in the ravages of war
 bataa den ki ISIS kaa prabhaav ab iraq kii seemaa se lagate syria ke kuch shaharon tak hi rah gaya he
 The Syrian regime in Damascus was told that they had no information about the Indians abducted from Iraq in mid-2014
 syria ke raashtrapati bashar al asad kii salaahkaar dow bouthana shabaan ne kaha, ‘mere paas koi soochna nahin he
 If they were kidnapped from Mosul, the Iraqi government would know something about this
 agar ISIS kii ore se unhen laayaa (syria main) gaya hoga to rakka le jaaya gaya hoga, hamaare paas nahin, syria sarkaar ke paas nahin laayaa gaya hoga
 India Today reporter turned to the city of Aleppo via the ruined towns of Syria, the structures of ruined buildings
 aleppo ko kabhi syria kii kaarobaari rajdhani mana jaataa tha
 The reporter's attempt was to get a clue about the 39 missing Indians from anywhere
 aleppo main sainikon se baat kii gai
 Apart from this, attempts were also made to find out the fighters under the flag of the Lebanese organization Hezbollah
 lekin kisi ke paas bhi agava bharatiyon ke bare main koi jaankaree nahin thi
 a middle-aged man who has been fighting ISIS for all the years said in Arabic, 'no, we have no information
 ’kahin se koi jaankaree ab tak nahin milane ke baavjood 39 bharatiyon kaa pataa lagane ke hausale main koi kami nahin ai he
 The search mission continues
 
 
 
 And will continue until the reality of what happened to the 39 Indians is revealed

 Unfortunately, it is here that India has seen the most disturbing thing of 'lack of governance'
 unhone kaha ki aisa nahin he ki da manmohan singh main eemaandaaree kii kami he lekin aaj is baat se koi inkaar nahin kar saktaa ki jis pad (offis) par asin hai, usamen eemaandaaree kii kami he
 The BJP leader said that if you ask him (singh) about the 2G spectrum scam, he will blame the coalition compulsions
 is tarah pradhanmantri ne mana he ki jab yah lut ho rahi thi unke karyaalay ne ankhe moond rakhi thim
 Attacking Singh, he said that the above argument of the Prime Minister is also not correct, because by saying that he wants to show that corrupt practices are limited only to the ministers who belong to the allies of the Congress-led coalition
 unhone kaha, haalanki jis tarah boforce ghotaale kii jaanch ko band kiya gaya usase isamen congress kii liptata kahin adhik dikhti he

 However, he stayed away from this campaign of publicity for his own reasons
 vaise jasoos jo chahta tha vah jaaduugarani nahin chaahati thi
 Harry Potter and JK Rowling, who created a whole magical world with him, live in Edenburgh, but want London to remain their capital
 tennis kaa jaadugar adi mare bahut der tak sochataa rahaa ki vah alag scotland ke saath khadaa ho yaa great britain kaa samarthan kare
 At the very end, he played his shot and found that he was standing in the wrong court
 usne azaadi kaa samarthan kiya, lekin aadhe se zyada scotland ko laga ki ye azaadi uske liye jaruri nahin
 Those who have seen this turnout and its results on the question of Scottish independence may not realize how big a historical change he has become
 hajaaron baras kii insaani sabhyataa main mulk talwaar kii dhar par banate or mitate rahe hai
 Guns, rifles and bombs have drawn new lines in the world map
 mulkon kii paidaaish yaa maut aisi takalifdeh dastaanen rahi hai, jinamein bahut khun bahata he, bahut nafrat nikalati he or dher sara zakhm sadiyon tak bachaa rahata he
 Such instances are less common in the world when the country is separated or free from mutual thinking and trust

 Under these circumstances, the opinion on Scottish independence has shown in the twenty-first century the spirit of a grown man who does not get caught up in the boom of nationalism and makes no noise of fake patriotism
 agar ye raishumaari na hoti to scotland main azaadi chaahane waalon ke bheetar ye shikaayat badi ho rahi hoti ki great britain uske saath ninsaafi kar rahaa he
 But Scotland has been decided by its people and the rulers have accepted it

 Mukesh Ambani of Reliance Industries has surpassed Steel King LN Mittal to become the richest Indian in the world
 mukesh ambani kaa networth 20
 8 billion dollars

 LN Mittal is second in the list of richest people, whose net worth is 20
 5 arab dollar he, jabaki mukesh ambani ke chote bhai anil ambani 12
 It is third on the list with a net worth of $ 5 billion

 It is the fourth number with assets of $ 9 billion
 jabaki dlef ke chairman ke pi singh 7
 Amir Hindustani is at number five on the list with $ 8 billion
 forbs kaa kahana he ki bharat ke top 40 amiron kii networth ek saal main 60 fisadi giri he
 The biggest reason for this is the decline in the stock market
 bhartiya share bazaar ek saal main 48 fisadi neeche aayaa he

 Anil Agarwal owns 59 per cent in Cairn India through his Indian partner Sesa Sterlite, a metal and mining company Vedanta Resources listed on the London Stock Exchange
 kern india pichley 15 saal main barmer main 201 kuen safaltaapurvak khod chuki he
 They emit 1,96,000 barrels of oil daily, which can reach 300,000 barrels per day in three years, while Bombay High discharges 280,000 barrels per day
 isse bombai haai kii oparator oengisi ko koi bada jhatka nahin lagane vaala kyonki kern ke barmer block main uske 30 fisadi share hai
 Cairn has a stake in seven oil and gas blocks in the country but has the largest stake in Rajasthan

 Meanwhile, Vedanta bought most of the shares in August 2010

 Ambitious Plan To increase production of Badmer, Cairn has taken approval of Integrated Block Development Scheme (IBDP) from Ministry of Petroleum
 mantralay ne yah nayaa nitigat faisla liya he taaki companiyon ke tel or gas kshetra kii khoj se utpaadan ke str par jaldi jane main sahuuliyat ho
 According to the plan, Cairn has been allowed to dig 450 wells of which 100 will be explored for oil and 350 will be developed in the field
 ilango ne barmer kaa kaamkaaj yuva rigervyr ejeeniyar suniti bhatta ke jimme de rakhaa he
 According to Bhatt, his immediate plan is to bring oil from satellite fields and make small discoveries especially in Mangla, Bhagyam and Aishwarya (MBA) fields
 bhatta iske saath mangala kshetra main tel nikaalane ke tareeke talash rahe hai
 It is the oldest block in Cairn and produces about 1,51,000 barrels of oil daily, but it is said that it has reached the highest production level
 bhatta kehete hai, “kuen se 100 bairal main se 35 bairal hi nikal rahaa he
 With a technology called EOR, Cairn expects to extract about 15 percent more oil, that is, about 22,500 barrels of crude oil extra every day
 mangala main kaam shuru ho gaya he
 After that work will begin in Bhagyam and Aishwarya

 According to the terms of the agreement, Cairn left the areas where he could not find oil

 This area is about 8,000 sq km
 in chode gaye hnetron se taiyaar do blox ke liye haal hi nividaayen mangai gayi
 The Petroleum Ministry is also silent on Agarwal's proposal to sell crude oil in the international market
 kern reliance industries or essar oil jaisi bhartiya rifineriyon ko maanak keemat se kareeb 15 pha sadi riyaayat par kaccha tel bech rahi he
 Ministry officials believe that a policy decision can be taken only after the general elections in May
 phi lahaal bharat sirf savandrdhit utpaada kaa hi niryaat karata he, kachche tel kaa nahin
 (an oil drilling area in Barmer) There is also another major headache for Agarwal
 sarkaar kern ke barmer or raava block main utpaadan main hissedari ke prastaav par bhi kundali maare baithi he
 The original agreement for Barmer will expire in 2020
 ilango kehete hai, “chunki hamane rageshwari deep gas field se gas kaa vyavsaayik utpaadan shuru kar diya he isliye ham swatah block ke qaraar ke vistaar kii ummid kar rahe hai
 "according to the current rules of the Petroleum Ministry, if an operator searches for gas, he will automatically get an agreement for the next 10 years

 But it may be difficult for Kernke to follow his Rajasthan block strategy

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath are coming to inaugurate the Magenta Metro Line on 25 December
 is dauraan flats khariddaar unke khilaaf virodh pradarshan karne kii taiyaari main hai
 Flat buyers are very upset with the arrival of PM Modi and CM Yogi in Noida
 darasal, bijepi ne centre or upi main sarkaar banane se pehle vaada kiya tha ki khariddaaron ko flats samay se nahin dene vaale builder ke khilaaf karwai hogi or logon ko ghar dilaae jaaenge, lekin sarkaar banane ke baad ab tak koi thos karrwai nahin kii gai
 The attitude of Modi and Yogi government in this matter is wavering
 flats khariddaaron ne poster jari kar diya he, jisamen 25 disambar ko 11 baje se noida ke sector-16 main virodh pradarshan karne kii baat kahi gai he
 Most of the buyers are Amrapali and JP Builder
 iske liye ghar khariddaaron ne isaki muhim bhi shuru kar di he, jahaan twit ke jariye khariddaaron ko joda ja rahaa he
 Most buyers are worried that they did not get a house even after waiting for seven to eight years
 builder ab bhi flats dene kaa naam nahin le rahe hai or jumalebaji kar rahe hai
 Buyers say that we have also asked PM Modi by tweeting that many times we have sent a letter to the PMO about the problem of not getting a house, but till date why no response was received
 jo chunaav ke dauraan ghar dilaane kaa vaada kiya gaya tha, us vaade kaa kya hua?maaloom ho ki shahar main kareeb dedh lakh aise khariddaar hai, jo pichley kai saalon se flats ko lekar builder or praadhikaran kaa virodh karte aa rahe hai
 However, their problem still remains
 satta parivartan ke baad mukhyamantri ne unki samasya par maraham lagane kaa kaam to kiya, lekin vah santusht nahin hai
 So flattened buyers will now try to awaken governments by organizing protests on the day of the Prime Minister's program
 yogi adityanath ne bhi vaada kiya tha ki is saal tak 50,000 khariddaaron ko ghar mil jaaenge, lekin sirf 32,000 logon ko hi ghar milane kii ummid he
 At the same time, the biggest buyer is in Amrapali, but no action has been taken against Amrapali builder so far
 yahaan tak ki amrapali ke flats khariddaaron ko apane ashiyane milane par bhi sanshay najar aa rahaa he
 There is tremendous anger among buyers about this
 rob nichol or tillakaratne dilashaan kii tufaani pariyon se romaanch kii paraakaashtha par taai chute match main srilanka ne super over main newjiland ko haraakar tii20 championships ke super aath main do ank hasil kiye

 isse pehle donon tiimon kii paariyaan salaami jodiyon ke karishmai pradarshan ke ird gird gumti rahi
 For New Zealand, Nicole scored 58 off 40 balls with the help of three fours and four sixes and meanwhile shared a 57-run partnership for the first wicket with Guptill (38 off 34 balls)
 srilanka ke liye dilashaan (52 gend par paanch chauke or teen chhakkon kii madad se 75 ran) or captain mahela jayavardhane (26 gend par 44 ran) ne pehle wicket ke liye keval 44 gend par 80 ran kii saajhedaari karke team ko tufaani shuruyaat dilaayi lekin newjiland ke gendbaajon ne gajab kii vaapasi karke match kaa taai kar diya
 It was the seventh T20 international match that lifted the tie
 newjiland ricard chaar taai maichon kaa hissaa rahaa he
 He lost this second match in a super over
 is match kaa dilachasp aankada yah rahaa ki jayavardhane or main aaf da match dilashaan ne apni pariyon ke dauraan tii20 antarrashtriya cricket main 1000 ran bhi puure kiye
 Jayawardene became the fourth batsman in the world and the first Sri Lankan batsman to achieve this milestone
 dilashaan ne unke kuch der baad yah aankada chuaa
 Kumar Sangakkara (21 runs off 14 balls) missed out on this position by only 12 runs
 srilanka ne jis tarah se shuruyaat kii thi usase lag rahaa tha ki vah aasaani se lakshya hasil kar legaa
 Ross Taylor made the bowling debut with spinner Nathan mccullum but Dilshan made his intentions clear with two fours and six in his first over
 southi ko jayavardhane or dilashaan donon ne nishane par rakhaa jinhone pehle do over main 30 ran diye
 Sri Lanka scored 68 runs in six overs of the powerplay, the highest in this tournament
 jaikab oram ne jayavardhane ko out karke newjiland ko pehali safalataa dilaayi jinhone apni pari main teen chauke or itane hi chakke lagaaye
 Sangakkara, who came to replace Jayawardene, hit fours off consecutive balls of Oram but he was run out in a tiff with Dilshan
 naye ballebaaj jivan mendis (8) adhik der tak nahin tik paye lekin dilashaan jame rahe
 When Sri Lanka needed 21 runs in two overs, Dilshan reduced the difference between the runs and the ball with a six off James Franklin, but he was run out in an attempt to steal a second run fast on the next ball
 isse pehle nichol or guptil ke alaava newjiland kii taraf se brandan maikulam ne 16 gend par 25 or captain rose tailor ne 15 gend par 23 ran banaaye
 The specialty of New Zealand's innings was its batsmen playing openly against the spinners

 He plundered 48 runs in four overs and took a wicket
 nichol ne unke ek over main teen chakke jadkar kul 24 ran batore
 Out of these sixes, he also completed his second half-century in T20

 Dhananjay dismissed Guptill in his first over

 Nuwan Kulasekara bowled out Taylor and Jacob Oram (6) in their one over as New Zealand failed to score the required runs in the final two overs
 mana ki videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj (sandarbhah lalit modi) udaaramana hai
 Shivraj Singh Chauhan is the whistleblower of the Vyapam scam and the allegations against Vasundhara are not authentic but the question still remains as to who stopped the Modi government from cleaning up cricket? Why wait for court whip to investigate Vyapam scam? Who is obstructing the legal prohibition of the bill preventing fraud in sports? What is the problem in creating a legal and institutional framework for transparency? If the Modi government had stood in Parliament today with such steps and decisions, then within a year, it would not have to face the same questions on corruption that it has been asking the Congress continuously for the last several years
 sansad kii khinchataan se zyada gambhir pahalu yah he ki modi sarkaar ke pehle ek saal main ucch padon par paardarshita ko lekar vah bebaak fark najar nahin aayaa jisaki ummid usase kii gai thi
 Fresh controversies that have embarrassed the BJP from the Center to the states are actually the mistakes of governance, due to authoritarian arrogance or defection
 ye galtiyaan pehle hi saal main isliye aa dhamkeen kyonki pichley ek saal main gavarnence main paardarshita ko lekar nae upaay karnaa to dur, sarkaar ne maujuuda vyavastha se hi asahmati jataa di
 Making a distance from a tainted person is normal vigilance
 isliye jab sushamaa swaraj jaisi tajurbekaar mantri kanoon kii najar main apradhi lalit modi kii madad ke liye itane bedadak hokar apane pad kaa istemaal karti hai to achraj hona lajimi he
 In the light of the family and professional relationship between Swaraj and Lalit Modi, Sushma should have been more cautious
 purv ipiel pramukh kii madad agar videsh mantri kii galati he to yah chook darasal satta main hone kii beficri kaa nateeja he
 Sushma will be in more trouble if non-bailable warrants are issued against Lalit Modi
 pankaja munde ke chikki va khichdi kharid faislon ko dekhakar adana-sa clerk bhi yah bataa degaa ki is tarah ke nirnay satta kii takat sir chadhgaye kii vajah se hote hai
 As per the state government rules, purchases above Rs 1 crore can be made from tender only while Pankaja has made a lump sum of Rs 206 crore
 kii kharid kar daali
 He also admitted this mistake in the assembly this week
 maharashtra main kheti mashiinon kii kharid kaa 150 karod ru
 And the scam is open, in which the general rules of the tender have been violated openly
 phikr honi chahie ki agar bijepi kii nai sarkaron main anya mantriyon ne bhi sushamaa yaa pankaja kii tarah manamaane faisle kiye hai to phir party or modi sarkaar ke liye aane vaale maheenon main kai badi mushkilen taiyaar ho rahi hai
 Not only Shanta Kumar, many people in BJP will be saying that the Modi government should have been more strict about transparency
 sakhti dikhaane ke maukon kii kami bhi nahin thi
 For example, after coming to power, BJP could pass the Sporting Fraud Bill so that the mud of cricket could be cleared
 sattebaaji jaise aparaadhon ke liye jail va baari jurmaane kii sajaa kaa praavdhaan karne vaala vidheyak do saal se lambit he or iske bina lodha samiti kii siforeeshon ke tahat sajaa paae mayppan or kundra par koi sakht karrwai nahin ho sakati
 In this sequence, the initiative to bring sports unions under the purview of the law could also become an evidence of the seriousness of the Modi government towards making sports clean
 lekin paardarshita ke agrahon ko majboot karne kii bajaae vitt mantri arun jetali ne na keval sibiai ko yah salaah de daali ki use faislon main eemaandaar galati (onest erar) va bhrashtachar main fark samajhnaa hoga, balki iske liye bhrashtachar nirodhak kanoon main badlaav kii taiyaari bhi shuru kar di
 At the end of the budget session, the government brought amendments to the Whistleblower Act, under which it is proposed to discourage voicing against corruption
 agar yah sanshodhan paarit hua to bhrashtachar ke khilaaf ladaai lagbhag asambhav ho jaaegi
 If the fresh watch on the right to information is added to this list, then it is bound to question the government's intentions regarding transparency in governance
 taaja vivaad yah mahasoos karaate hai ki sarkaar na keval gavarnence or galatiyon balki bhuulon ke bachaav main bhi congressi taur-tareekon kii hi mureed he
 Madhya Pradesh Governor Ramnaresh Yadav should have left in February when the FIR in the Vyapam scam took place
 supreme court ke taaja aadesh ke baad to unke pad par bane rahane kaa matlab hi nahin he
 Recognizing that the Yadavs are the legacy of the Congress at the Raj Bhavan in Bhopal, by maintaining them, the government is inviting the upa-like spirit
 sushamaa va pankaja jaise mantriyon kii 'bhoolen' bataati hai ki bijepi kii sarkaron main bhi paardarshita ke aagrah majboot nahin hai
 The latest disputes express the skepticism of the government's leadership on corruption in high positions
 upie sarkaar bhi thik isi tarah ucch padon par bhrashtachar ko lekar do took faislon se bachati rahi
 As a result the courts tightened and the government lost its credibility
 modi sarkaar satta main aane ke baad pehali baar rakshaatmak dikh rahi he or bhrashtachar par adaalatein phir sakriy (vyapam) ho chali hai
 The Prime Minister should realize that without hardening against corruption, talk will not happen
 iske liye unhen ucch padon par paardarshita ke kathor pratimaan tay karne honge, kyonki sansad main vipaksh kaa gatirodh utani badi chunauti nahin he, zyada badi uljhan yah he ki jo sarkaar bhrashtachar ke khilaaf janadesh par savaar hokar satta main pahunchi vah ek saal ke bheetar bhrashtachar ko lekar bachaav kii mudra main he
 This is a tremendous anti-climax of expectations about Narendra Modi

 elahabaad ucch nyaayalay ne ayodhya main ramajanm bhoomi babari masjid ke vivaadit sthal par malikana haq ko lekar sunaaye apane faisle main use bhagwaan ram kaa janm sthaan mana
 Justice DV Sharma, Justice Sudhir Aggarwal and SU Khan, in their judgment on Thursday, have held in one opinion that the disputed site of Ayodhya is the birthplace of Lord Ram
 baharhaal, nyaayamurti khan ne apane faisle main yah bhi kaha he ki vivaadit sthal par donon samudaay kaa adhikaar he or yah bhi ki vahaan masjid nirmaan ke liye kisi mandir ko nahin todaa gaya tha
 The justices ruled with a majority that the disputed structure could not be considered a mosque as Babur had not constructed it according to the principles of Islamic Sharia
 nyaayamurti khan ne is mudde par dono saathi nyaayamurtiyon kii raay se sahmati nahin jataayi or kaha ki vivaadit dhaancha masjid hi tha ise babar ne banwaaya tha yaa jise babar ke aadesh se banwaaya gaya tha
 Justice Khan said that a third part has been announced for all the three parties, 'however if a minor adjustment is made on the part of one party while partitioning, then the party whose loss will be made to compensate for some of the land acquired by the Central Government Part will be done
 nyaayamurti khan ne kaha, ‘teenon pakshon muslim, hindu or nirmohi akhaada ko sanyukt rup se us vivaadit kshetra kii sampatti (parisar kaa swami ghoshit kiya jaataa he, jaisaa mukadmaa sankhya ek main adaalat dwaara nirdhaarit ayukta) adhivaktaa shri shiv shankar laal dwaara taiyaar nakshaa yojana ek main e bi si di i or epa patron main ullekh kiya gaya he
 The three parties will use one third of it and manage it for worship
 is aashya ke praarambhik aadesh ko manjuuri di gai
 However, the judge considered that the part below the middle dome, where the idol is currently housed in the temporary temple, would be given to the Hindus in the final order
 nyaayamurti khan ne apane faisle ke dauraan vyavastha di ki vivaadit dhaanche ko babar ke aadesh se athwa unke dwaara masjid ke taur par tamir kiya gaya, lekin pratyaksh sakshya se yah siddh nahin ho paaya ki nirmit bhaag sahit vivaadit parisar babar kaa tha athwa uskaa tha, jisane ise banaaya
 He also said that no temple was demolished to build the mosque, rather it was built on the ruins of the temple, which had been present there for a long time
 nyaayamurti agarwal ne apane aadesh main kaha, ‘yah ghoshit kiya jaataa he ki teen gumbadon vaale dhaanche ke bich vaale gumbad kaa hissaa, jo bhagwaan ram ke janmasthan ke rup main vivaadit he or hinduon kii aasthaa or vishwaas ke anusaar bhagwaan ram kaa janmasthan he, vah yachi (bhagwaan ram kii taraf kaa paksh) kaa he or prativaadiyon dwaara kisi bhi tareeke se usamen baadha athwa dakhal nahin diya jaae
 However, it is clarified that by this order the part of the yacht (the side of Lord Rama's) part of the dome between the three-domed structure is also added
 ’ nyaayamurti agarwal ne kaha ki bahari praangan main sthit ram chabutara, sita rasoi or bhandar ke dhaanchon ko nirmohi akhaade ke hisse main joda jaae or kisi vyakti ke isse behatar malikana haq kii sthiti main na hone par use iskaa kabja saunp diya jaae
 Justice Aggarwal said that the open portion of the outer courtyard should be divided into the side facing Nirmohi Akhara and Lord Rama as it is generally used for worship by Hindus at both the places
 ‘haalanki yah spasht kiya jaataa he ki muslim paksh kaa hissaa parisaron ke kul bhaag ke ek tihaai se kam nahin hoga or agar jaruri ho to use bahari praangan kaa kuch bhaag bhi diya ja saktaa he
 'the judge said,' It is also clarified that if some minor adjustments are made on the part of different parties while determining the parts of the three parties, then giving the land from the land acquired by the Government of India to the affected party
 To be compensated ’ in maamalon par apane nishkarsh main nyaayamurti agarwal ne kaha ki muslim paksh yah sabit karne main asafal rahe ki vivaadit sampati kaa nirmaan 1528 main babar ne karavaaya tha
 Justice Sharma, writing a separate verdict, ruled that the disputed site was the birthplace of Lord Ram
 ‘yah ek daivya vyakti kaa janm sthaan he or poojaneey he
 He is worshiped as a divine soul
 ’ nyaayamurti sharma ne kaha, ‘divya shakti har kisi ke liye kisi bhi aakaar athwa swaroop main kahin bhi har samay uski apni aasthaaon ke saath maujuud ho sakati he or yah niraakaar bhi ho sakati he
 On the disputed structure, Justice Sharma said, 'it was built by Babur, in which year, it is not certain, but it was against the principles of Islam, therefore it cannot be called a mosque
 ’ anya do nyaayadhishon se alag raay rakhte hue unhone yah vyavastha bhi di ki vivaadit dhaanche kaa nirmaan puraane dhaanche ko giraane ke baad usee sthaan par kiya gaya tha
 According to him, 'archaeological Survey of India has proved that the structure was a huge Hindu religious building
 ’ unhone kaha ki vivaadit dhaanche ke madhya vaale gumbad main 22 or 23 disambar 1949 kii darmyaani raat ko murtiyon rakhi gai thim
 Regarding the status of the disputed site having inner and outer courtyards, Justice Sharma said, 'it has been proved that the property in the suit is the birthplace of Ram Chandra ji and that' Charan ',' Sita Rasoi ', other statues and others on the disputed property Hindus generally have the right to worship revered objects
 unhone kaha, ‘yah bhi sthapit tathy he ki hindu vivaadit sthaan ko janmasthan maanakar uski puja karte hai or yah unke liye pavitra tirthasthal he
 'after the construction of the disputed structure, the judge said,' it was proved that the statues within the disputed structure were 22-23
 12
 Was established on 1949
 yah bhi sthapit tathy he ki bahari praangan vishuddh rup se hinduon ke swaamitv main tha or vahi isamen puja karte the or bhitari praangan (vivaadit dhaanche main) main bhi vah puja karte rahe hai
 He said, 'it has also been established that the disputed structure cannot be considered a mosque as it was not constructed in accordance with the principles of Islam

 jane-maane vakil va purv kendriya mantri sibbal se poocha gaya ki congress rahul gandhi ko apana pradhanmantri ummidavaar ghoshit karne se hichak kyon rahi he? unhone kaha, 'agar congress ko 272 (siten) milteen to koi hichkichaahat nahin hoti
 'on insisting that the Congress can still put forward Rahul Gandhi as its prime ministerial candidate and say that if the party gets a majority it will be the Prime Minister
 is par unhone kaha, 'nisandeh
 
 agar hamen bahumat miltaa he to isamen koi andeh nahin he
 
 (lekin) ise kehane kaa koi sawaal nahin he
 We know that we will not get a majority
 ham jaanate hai ki hamen 272 (siten) nahin hasil hongi, ham yah bhi jaanate hai ki bhaajapa ko bhi 160 se zyada siten nahin milengi
 "when he was told that he was making a big statement, he replied," Why not, absolutely, we will not get (majority)
 koi sambhaavna nahin he
 Sibal was again asked whether he wanted to say that the Congress would not get a majority? To this, he said, 'we will not get 272 seats on our own
 bahumat milane kii baat kahana mere liye morrkhtaa hogi or bhaajapa ko 160 se kam siten milengi
 With this, he said that the Congress-led UPA will get an edge in the elections and it can form the government
 haalanki, ise 'mahagathbandhan' se bhi ladanaa he
 The 'grand Alliance' is a coalition of some opposition parties in Uttar Pradesh
 yah puche jane par ki agar congress kii aguwai vaala upie bahumat hasil karata he to pradhanmantri koun ho saktaa he? sibbal ne kaha ki yah gathbandhan dwaara tay kiya jayega

 Asked whether there can be anyone other than Rahul Gandhi? He said, 'I don't know
 gathbandhan tay karegaa
 Coalition partners will decide on this subject
 jahaan tak congress party kaa sawaal he to vah congress main nirvivaad netaa hai
 When questioned about the potential of the grand alliance, Sibal said that it has not been made by the Congress
 unhone kaha, 'hamaara gathbandhan ekajute he
 We have an alliance with the party
 hamaare sabhi gathbandhan 2014 se pehle ke hai or barkaraar hai, chaahe yah rakanpa ho yaa dramuk
 We have added two more

 ' Rajeshwar Singh, convener of the Dharm Jagran Coordination Committee, which announced to make India a Hindu nation by 2021, was removed from his post
 zaahir taur paraye faisla sangh kaahe
 Rajeshwar Singh came into the limelight when he organized a proselytizing program in Agra on 8 December
 rajeshwar ko hathaaye janeke peeche bhale hi tabiyat kharaab hone kii baaten kii ja rahi hon lekin satta or siyaasi gilyaron main iske myne kuch alag hi nikaale ja rahe hai
 After the formation of the BJP government at the center, conversion became the first issue on which Modi had to sit silently
 rajeshwar singh saare tivi channelon par 56 inch jaisaa seenaa phulaakar kar bharat ko hindu raashtra banane vaala bayaan de rahe the
 On the other hand, the opposition was surrounded by the government in Parliament on this matter
 puraa sheetakaaleen satr is hangaamen kii bhent chadh gaya
 Troubled by questions, Modi had to give strict instructions to the ministers, mps and party leaders who made statements
 darasal, modi ko is baat kaa ahsaas ho gaya ki dharmantaran ke mudde par sarkaar kii chhavi kahin naa kahin dhoomil ho rahi he
 It became necessary to instill confidence in the public and especially in the country's minority community
 modi sarkaar ne iske liye pahal karte huye ek yojana banaai
 Whose command is commanded by Minister of State for Minority Affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi
 naqvi desh ke alpsankhyakon se milakar unhen bataaenge ki kendra sarkaar kii is bare main kya soch he
 And will ask people to rise above religion and caste for development
 jab pradhanmantri narendra modi is maamle ko lekar itane gambhir hai to aise main rajeshwar singh kaa achaanak se pad se hataa diya janaa aise hi nahin ho saktaa
 One special thing here is that the news coming from the Sangh clearly indicates that Modi is not from the Sangh but the Sangh is now with Modi
 rajeshwar singh ko baahar kiye janaa is baat kaa saboot he ki piem modi sangh par dabaav banane main kaamyaab hue hai
 They want to remove those people who are trying to bring the saffron brigade back on the old agenda
 ab chaahe sangh yaa bijepi ke netaa kuch bhi kahen lekin modi kaa rukh saaf hone laga he ki wo ab is tarah kii kisi baat ko bardaasht nahi karenge jo unki sarkaar ke liye pareshaani kaa sabab bane yaa phir sarkaar kii chhavi ko kharaab kare
 This can also be understood that this is the beginning of Modi's campaign against those who have been constantly causing problems for the government with their statements or actions
 shaayad ye ek sandesh bhi he ki modi hi ab asli 'sarkaar' hai
 The Samajwadi Party of Uttar Pradesh has already started preparing for the upcoming 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 iske liye baqayda party ke uttar pradesh adhyaksh naresh uttam patel kii taraf se chitthee jari kii gai he
 In this, he has made it clear that a candidate with a criminal background will not be given a ticket
 chitthee ke mutabik jin logon ko 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav ke liye aavedan karnaa he, unhen baqayada party kii taraf se die gaye ek formet main apni jaankariyaan bhejni hongi
 An application fee of Rs 10,000 will be submitted along with the form
 aavedankarta ko formet main yah bhi bataanaa hoga ki uske khilaaf koi mukadmaa darj he yaa nahin
 He should be a lifelong member of the Samajwadi Bulletin, be an active member of the Samajwadi Party and at the same time no fee should be owed to the Samajwadi Party's state office or any office over the applicant
 lekin sabase khaas baat yah he ki is baar samaajawaadee party ne apane party ke netaaon se aavedan ke saath-saath is baat kii bhi detail maangi he ki kahin unke khilaaf koi aapraadhik mukadmaa to darj nahi he
 According to Samajwadi Party spokesperson Juhi Singh, this is being done on the direction of the party president Akhilesh Yadav and the Samajwadi Party wants all its applicants and candidates for the election to have a clean image
 un par koi mukadmaa yaa gambhir aarope na hon, isiilie yah jaankaree likhit rup se maangi gai he
 Significantly, all parties, including the Samajwadi Party, have not yet refrained from giving tainted candidates
 yah pehali baar ho rahaa he jab likhit rup se kisi party kii taraf se aparaadhik mukademon kii jaankaree maangi gai he
 Also, for the first time a party is making an order to deposit a sum of Rs 10,000
 iske peeche bhi party kaa tark he taaki syrius candidet applai kar sake or party fund ke liye bhi dhanrashi kaa intjaam ho sake
 However, the discussion with this order is whether the Samajwadi Party really wants to field candidates with a clean image in the upcoming elections or just to pretend to have a clean image
 agar itihaas par gaur kiya jaae to samaajawaadee party samet bijepi,bahujan samaaj partya congress koi bhi party aisi nahin he, jisamen daagi chhavi vaale candidats ne chunaav naa ladaa ho
 Now it remains to be seen whether the Samajwadi Party really uses this information in ticket distribution or leaves it by paperwork
 aaj kaa dinaitihaasake pannon main isliye khaas he, kyonki aaj hi ke din baba sahib bhimraombedkarne apane 3,80,000 saathiyon ke saath hindoodharmako tyaag karbuddha dharmpana liya tha
 It was only in the 1950s that Babasaheb became attracted to Buddhism and went to Sri Lanka (then Ceylon) to attend a Buddhist conference
 14 oktober 1956 ko nagpur main unhone apane lakhon samarthakon ke saath buddha dharm grahan kiya
 Although the number of his followers has been stated differently
 is maukey par unhone jo 22 pratigyaaen leen usase hindu dharm or uski puja paddati ko unhone purna rup se tyaag diya
 Millions of Dalits along with Dr
 Ambedkar embraced Buddhism and this was the biggest religious conversion in the whole world
 haalanki khud unhone ise dharm parivartan nahin balki dharm-janit shaareerik, maansik va aarthik daastaa se mukti bataaya
 Ambedkar was born into the Mahar caste considered untouchable and inferior in the Hindu caste
 unhone hindu dharm main vyaapt chhot pratha ko khatm karne ke liye na sirf saamaajik balki kanoonee rasta bhi akhriyaar kiya
 He believed that only by changing the law, change of heart and mind is possible
 unke buddha dharm apnaane ke peeche buddha dharm main chuaachhut or jati pratha jaisi kuriti kaa na hona tha
 i am born a Hindu, but i will not die a Hindu, Ambedkar, with the strength with which the Dalits were engaged in uniting them and empowering them politically and socially, with the same strength, their opponents also insisted to stop them
 Was applying lambey sangharsh ke baad jab ambedkar ko bharosa ho gaya ki ve hindu dharm se jatipratha or chuaa-chhot kii kureetiyaan dur nahin kar paa rahe to unhone wo aitihaasik vaktavy diya jisamen unhone kaha ki main hindu paidaa to hua hum, lekin hindu maruunga nahin
 Opposition to Hindu Code Bill After independence, Dr
 Ambedkar became Law Minister in the cabinet of Pandit Nehru and on the initiative of Nehru, he prepared the Hindu Code Bill, but he had to face strong opposition to this bill too
 khud nehru bhi tab apni party ke andar or baahar is mudde par badhate dabaav ke saamne jhukate najar aae
 Differences on the issue increased so much that Ambedkar resigned from the post of Law Minister
 haalanki baad main hindu code bill paas hua or usase hindu mahilaon kii sthiti main krantikari badlaav bhi aayaa lekin ambedkar ke bill se ye kai maamalon main lacheela tha

 kejariwal kaa kahana he ki varisht adhivaktaa par hamalaa bhrashtachar ke mudde se bhatakaane kaa ek prayaas tha
 He questioned the police action and alleged that the police did not take swift action against the attackers
 kejariwal ne aashcharya jataayaa ki kya aisa karne ke liye ‘upar se koi nirdesh tha
 Anna: Ramlila Maidan, via Mayur Vihar to Tihar
 
 
 kejariwal ne shuukravaar ko kaha tha ki ham nahin samajhate ki yah kashmir par tippanee thi jisane hamale ke liye uksaaya
 It seems that all the corrupt people have gathered in one place
 yah bhrashtachar se dhyaan bataane kaa ek prayaas tha, ham samajhate hai ki yah ek sajeesh he
