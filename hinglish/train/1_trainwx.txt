 kisi bank se aap lakhon-karodon kii nakadi hasil kar sakate hai, lekin meerut kaa bank gyaan ke khajaane se maalamaal he
 The resourceless children taking advantage of this understand the importance of book bank and book bank
 in bacchon ko book bank kii taraf se muft kitaaben uplabdh karai jaati hai
 Anita Sharma, a resident of Vijayanagar in Meerut, was a village girl and used to go to school two kilometers away from her home to study
 kitaaben nahin hone ke chalate anitha padhai nahin kar paa rahi thim
 She was very sad about this
 anitha khud bhi apane bade bahan bhai kii puraani kitabon se padhai kar rahi thim
 Anita is married to Sanjay Sharma of Meerut who runs a coaching center
 4 rajyo main 55 shakhaeinita ne apane man kii baat apane pati ko bataai to donon ne milakar 2016 main ek free book bank kii sthapana kii
 The purpose of which was to provide books to children and people who could not read due to lack of books
 aaj meerut ke is book bank kii 4 rajyon main 55 shakhaaen hai or hazaron bachche is book bank se kitaab lekar padhai kar rahe hai
 All types of books are available in this book bank
 pehali kaksha se lekar sabhi kakshaon kii yaa phir chaahe medical kii taiyaari ke liye ho yaa koi dharmik kitaab ho, yahaan sab kitaaben milti hai wo bhi ek dam free
 So the series that Anita started two years ago, today it has many branches and millions of books in the bank are illuminating the knowledge in the lives of children

 iskaa sidhaa arth he ki kejariwal sarkaar sienji kit par lage pratibandh ko hataane kii taiyaari kar rahi he
 The right to registration is not to the Delhi government
 Transport Minister Satyendra Jain says that 'the central government has allowed more than 10 companies to install CNG kits and make it clear that Delhi government does not have the right to register companies
 jab maine parivahan vibhaag sambhala tha tab inhen kaarobaariyon ne aapas main shikaayat kii thi ki ek kit ke certificate kii photocopy se 50 nakli kit lagavaaye ja rahe hai

 or sienji kit lagane par pratibandh laga diya tha
 New system will come soon
 Kejriwal government has prepared a new system to deal with the problems of installing CNG kits
 satyendra jain kaa kahana he ki 'agar nakli sienji kit lag jaati he to jaan ko khatra ho jaataa he
 So we have created a new system, in which the businessman who is importing or building it will put his information on the website

 Satyendra Jain further said that the Transport Department will allow the same companies to install kits which have got permission from the Central Government
 sarkaar kaa maananaa he ki nae system se nakli kit lagane kii gunjaish khatm ho jaaegi
 'before the government should take action against the wrongdoers, the businessmen associated with the work of CNG kit had demanded the Kejriwal government to withdraw the circular of June 20 and said that the Transport Department should not take action against those who are doing wrong To shut down the entire business
 aapako bataa den ki june ke maheene main gadabadi kii shikaayat milane ke baad sarkaar ne sienji kit lagane par roak lagane kaa aadesh jari kiya tha
 Actually, CNG kits were installed in 80 thousand vehicles in the 6 months from January 1 to June 16, but most of these kits were not according to the prescribed standards

 bharat ne siries main 4-0 se ajey badhat bana lee, jisase mejabaanon ko 2019 vishwa cap main sidhe pravesh nahin mil sakaa
 Gunawardene said on the eve of the fifth ODI, 'we don't have much time for preparation

 More than preparations, we need to keep the mental level fine

 ' With Indian investigators being in the US to question pakistani-american David Headley, Foreign Minister SM Krishna said that access to that would be 'probably the next logical step'

 Without naming Headley, Krishna said that accessing those suspected of being linked to the Mumbai attack by the US would be 'probably the next logical step'
 bharat hedli tak pahunch kii maang kar rahaa he, jo philhal chicago jail main band he, taaki usase mumbai hamalon kii puri sajeesh ke bare main poocha ja sake
 The US has assured India that it will reach India
 raashtrapati baraak obama ne april main pradhanmantri manmohan singh ko is bare main aashwast kiya tha
 This comment by Krishna is also significant because a team of India's National Investigation Agency is currently in the US in the hope of questioning Headley

 He said that more and more people should be encouraged to use plastic money like credit cards, rupay cards and checks
 isse mudra yaa behisabi dhan kaa istemaal kam hoga

 The UAPA Amendment Bill against Terrorism in the Rajya Sabha has passed
 isko pravar samiti main bhejne kaa prastaav voting ke dauraan gir gaya
 During the discussion on this bill, Congress leader Digvijay Singh said that he suspects AAP (BJP)
 congress ne kabhi aatankwaad se samjhauta nahin kiya he isliye yah bill lekar ai thi
 But you have compromised on terrorism twice, first in the release of Rubia Saeed and then Masood Azhar was released
 isse pehle congress ke rajyasabha saansad pi
 Chidambaram said that if anyone sees the amendment in this bill, then it is said to give more power to the NIA but now we are passing it in such a way that now anyone can be declared as terrorism so we are opposing this bill Huh
 pi
 Chidambaram said, 'when i was the Home Minister in 2008, i said that i would stand on three legs against terrorism
 pehla enie, doosraa NATGRID or teesraa antisi
 But now we have just one leg
 NATGRID or ensitisi kahaan hai'
 cpi-m's Ilaram Karim said that "government terrorism" is being imposed and those who express dissent can be declared terrorists
 ‘‘isse bade paimaane par utpeedan or anyaay hoga
 He said that with this amendment, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) would get an open license to go to that state and take action against any person without obtaining the permission of any state government or informing it
 Home Minister Amit Shah in Rajya Sabha: Chidambaram ji asked why to name an individual as a terrorist when the organization they are affiliated to is already banned
 It is because we ban one org, another one comes up by the same individuals
 Till when will we keep banning orgs? # uapapic

 Describing the provisions of the amendment bill as harsh, Jha said that this bill indicates the ideology that "if i criticize the government, i will be called anti-national
" ''digvijaya Singh in Rajya Sabha on # uapabill : We doubt their(bjp) intent
 Congress never compromised on terrorism that is why we had brought this law
 It is you who compromised on terror, once during release of Rubaiya Saeed ji and second by letting off Masood Azhar

 p Chidambaram in Rajya Sabha: In 2008 when i took over as Home Minister, i said anti-terrorism will stand on three legs- one is NIA, one is NATGRID and one is NCTC
 We have only one leg today, what have you done about NATGRID and NCTC? Why are they in limbo? https: / / t
 co / 9r85xdb8vb After this, responding to the discussion, Home Minister Amit Shah said, 'chidambaram ji's objection is why a particular person should be declared a terrorist when his organization has been banned
 darasal ham jab kisi sanghathan ko bain karte hai to vah kisi duusare naam se sanghathan banaakar aa jaataa he
 How long will we ban organizations'
 amit shah ne aage kaha ki digvijay singh ji gusse main lag rahe hai
 He has lost elections recently
 NIA ke teen keson main kisi ko bhi sajaa nahin hui he
 Because all these charges were made due to political vendetta and there was an attempt to link terrorism with a particular religion

 According to the report, the jaish-e-mohammed terrorist who blasted the suicide had approached the jaish-e-mohammed through the virtuous sim and was constantly in touch
 oficials ke mutabik jem ke suicide bombar dwaara yuj kiye gaye virtual sim jaanch ke liye america bheja ja saktaa he
 According to officials, the virtual SIM used by jaish-e-mohammed was generated from the service provider of the US
 gauratlab he ki virtual sim kaa yuj isliye bhi kiya jaataa he, taaki tres yaa trek na kiya ja sake
 What is Virtual SIM and how it works --- Virtual SIM is quite different from normal SIM and it can be generated online
 aam taur virtual sim se yugers ko cloud besd number diya jaataa he
 For calling or messaging, users have to download the app
 --- virtual sim ko kisi ap ke madad se kisi divaais main yuj kiya ja saktaa he
 Computer, laptop, smartphone or tablet
 isse yugers ek duusare ke saath communicket kar sakate hai
 --- The specialty of virtual SIM is that through this, calls can be placed and received on the local number
 kisi khaas desh tak limited nahin hota 50 deshon main kahin kaa bhi number ho saktaa he or isse kahin bhi kol kii ja sakati he
 --- For virtual sim, you do not have to go to a shop and give your ID and photo, because the numbers are computer generated
 number kahin kaa ho saktaa he, jaise america yaa britain
 --- Virtual SIM is also used to hide your identity
 iske liye virtual sim provirs ap downlod karaate hai
 Generally, this service is not free and you have to pay for it
 virtual number ke liye ap main sin ap karke aria code daalana hota he or aap isse kisi ko massej kol kar sakate hai
 --- To activate the virtual SIM, users are sent a code for verification in their own smartphone
 --- kul mila kar ye he ki varchul sim ke jariye kii gai communication ko aam sim kii tarah trek yaa tres nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 Perhaps this is why after the Pulwama terror attack, the officials are ready to ask the US to find out about this virtual sim after the virtual sim

 lekin isi duniya kii kai aisi bhi jagahen hai, jahaan in gairinsaani harkaton ke baavjood duniya ke sabasekhaufnak antkavaadi sanghathan yani iesasko lekar deewangi lagaataar bad rahi he
 This is the story of one such madness, in which the small children of Yemen are playing the dreaded game of beheading with other children like themselves
 duniya ke sabase khaufnak aatankwaadi sanghathan yani iesas kii ye tasviren ab duniya ke liye nai nahin hai
 Rather, if we say that in recent times, only the place and characters have changed in such pictures, then perhaps it will not be wrong, but now moving from this reality, the pictures of children from a village in Yemen She has come out, she has shocked the whole world
 vajah ye in tasveeron main yaman ke bachche bilkul iesas ke aatankwaadiyon kii tarah maut kaa khaufnak khel khelte hue najar aa rahe hai

 In it, on one side there are the tall masked children, who have become terrorists, while on the other side there are slightly weaker and younger children than these children who are victims of terrorist
 ye sabhi bachche nange badan hai or inhone apane haath peeche baandh rakhe hai, jabaki aatankwaadi bane bacchon ne apane shikaar duusare bacchon ko gardan se thik vaise hi daboch rakhaa he, jaise aatankwaadi aam taur par kisi ko sajaa dene se pehle karte hai
 Now everyone in the queue moves towards the hideout, where according to Ravayat, a drama is to be done among the people to behead these children
 badhate-badhate sabhi aatankwaadi bane bachche ek-ek baar jhukate hai or phir sir kalam karne ke liye jameen main rakhi chaaku jaisi koi cheez uthaa lete hai
 That is, Manjar is exactly the same as it is at the time of punishing people in a camp in ISIS
 shaam dhal rahi he or aatankwaadi bane bachche ek-ek kar apane sabhi shikaar ko ghutanon ke bal baithne kaa hukum sunaate hai or shikaar bane sabhi bachche thik vaisaa hi karte hai, jaisaa aatankwaadiyon ke hathe chadhane vaale laachaar or begunaah log karte hai
 Now it is the turn to be beheaded, but here too before the drama of beheading, a child turned into a terrorist like jihadi John faces the camera with his words

 logon ko tab tak chaiyn nahin miltaa jab tak ve aapaki jati ko nahin jaan lete
 Can the aggressive Hindutva tool bring all these sections of the public and the public who have lost their clout against each other in the realm of BJP? It should be noted that there are elections of local bodies here in the next few months and in 2016, Kerala Assembly elections are also proposed

 An example of aggressive Hindutva was seen here on 30 August when Natesan invited bjp's Sadhvi Niranjana Jyoti as a guest on the birth anniversary of Sri Narayana Guru
 pichhadi jati se aane vaali centre sarkaar kii mantri or bhagavadhari sadhvi ne yahaan bayaan diyaaru ''haduon ko naastikon se apni betiyon kii raksha kerani hogi
 Recently, when Amit Shah met Natesan and his son Tushar in Delhi, it was speculated that Natesan would tie up with the BJP and instead the party would send his son to the Rajya Sabha
 natesan kehete hai, ''bijepi koi achhut party nahin he
 We will work as a political pressure group

 "BJP is also speaking the same political language in Kerala

 Aseem asks Rashmi to help her in making bread
 isapar rashmi kahati hai ki koi madad ke liye aage nahin aata he kuch gavaar log bas subjiyan katkar hi chale jate hai
 Siddharth Shukla overhears Rashmi and he angrily says what have you said, just say it again
 siddharth rashmi ko bhi gavaar kah dete hai
 On this matter, both of them are fiercely tattooed
 rashmi ke saport main ain aarti-siddharth kii in baton ko sunne ke baad rashmi ek kone main baithkar rone lagati hai
 That's when Aarti silences Rashmi
 rashmi aarti ko bataati hai ki kis tarah siddharth unke kairactor par sawaal uthaa rahe hai
 Hearing this, Aarti tells Rashmi that if someone questions her character, she will stand with them
 mumbai police par jab-tab iljaam lagate rahe hai ki wo bevajaah logon ko uthaati he, peethti he unka tamaasha banaati he
 a few months ago, the same Mumbai police were accused of forcibly harassing loving couples
 jiske liye baad main tab ke police kamishnar ko maafee bhi maangani padi
 However, it seems that the Mumbai Police is not ready to improve
 kam se kam haal main saamne ai tasviir to yahi bataa rahi he
 This is the picture of the midnight drama inside a police station, after which the police are no longer going to answer
 aadhi raat kaa vakt hone ke baavjood mumbai ke andheri police stesan main is vaktakhasi bheedahai
 a couple is also present in the police station along with other complainants, who are being questioned separately by the police
 is poochtacha ke dauraan ladki rah-rah kar pulisavaalon se maafee maangati he or jane dene kii guhaar lagaati he
 She says that Ainda will not come here, it will leave from here quietly but the girl's complaint does not affect the policemen
 poochtacha jari rahati he or phir donon apni-apni pahchaan bataane lagate hai
 It is said that he works in Tech Mahindra and is about to go home with a train but the policemen do not listen to both
 balki jawaab dene par ek mahila pulicekarmiladki se badaslukishuru kar detii he or kabhi ai-card dikhaane par uskaa haath jhatak detii he to kabhi poochtacha kar rahaa afasar chair samet ladki ko dhakka de detaa he
 The girl kept screaming but the police did not stop, the complaint of the girl, these policemen passed so many times, they suddenly broke on both of them
 police darasal ladke ko hawalat main band karnaa chaahati he
 And from here it starts the barbarous process of the girl screaming and beating the police
 achaanak ladki kii aawaaj or bhi tej ho jaati he or is marpet se gussa kar wo gaali de baithti he
 On hearing the abuse, the policemen reach the seventh sky and then they both give such a ruckus that it is difficult to see them
 ladi or jents pulisavaale donon par ek saath tut padate hai
 Now, as the last weapon of her defense, the girl states that her mother works in Parliament
 unhen nahin chhodane par wo saare pulisavaalon se baat karegi, lekin ladki kii shekhi par pulisavaale ab uski khilli udaane lagate hai
 Laughs but the process of beating and pulling both continues
 or tab ladki rone lagati he
 The extent is reached when the beating of the policemen starts bleeding from the girl's mouth
 aakhir kya tha unka kasoor?aise hi buree tarah peetate hue pulisavaale jahaan ladke ko le jaakar jabaran hawalat main band kar dete hai, vahiin ladki ko khinch kar alag kar liya jaataa he
 Now, the girl again starts talking about calling her mother to work in Parliament
 lekin pulisavaale ab bhi uski hansi udaate hai
 Now even a policeman says that if his mother works in Parliament, then his father is a minister in Parliament
 sawaal ye he ki 20-22 saal ke umr ke is jode kaa aakhir kasoor kya he? aakhir kyon police tamaam fariyaad or guzaarishon ke baavjood unhen jane dene ko taiyaar nahin he? or aakhir unhen is tarah thane main marpet kar hawalat main band kar diya jaataa he
 The crime of the couple, who were beaten up badly in the police station in the middle of the night by the police in uniform, was just enough that the two started arguing over something outside the police station
 wo bhi bas jubaani bahes
 There is no fighting nor any ruckus or spectacle
 ab ye to ye police vaale hi bataaenge ki sadak par takaraar karnaa kis dfa main koun sa jurm he?darasal, ek kol centre main kaam karanevaala ye joda somvaar shaam ko apni duty puri kar ghar laut rahaa tha lekin donon ke bich raste main hi kisi baat ko lekar anban ho gai
 Right now, both of them were standing near the gate of the metro station, a little away from Andheri police station, and were heard that two constables on duty surrounded them and asked them to go to the police station for committing a ruckus
 donon ne thane jane se manaa kiya or chupchaap ghar chale jane kii baat kahi lekin police to police thahari
 She forcibly brought both of them to the police station and whatever happened after that, she is now in front of everyone
 chori se record kiya ghatana kaa videosutron kii maane to us raat donon ke saath marpet karne ke baad police ne unhen jhuthe mukademe main fansaane kii taiyaari main thi lekin thane main hi kisi kaam se gaye ek enjio ke member ne chori-chhipe ye puraa vakya apane mobile phone par shoot kar liya or jab pulisavaalon ko yekahani aam kar dene kii dhamkidi, tab jaakar pulisavaalon ne donon ke khilaaf exiaar darj karne kaa apana iraadaa badla
 The argument made by the policemen in their defense was no less shocking
 police ne of camera ye kaha ki donon ne us raat sharaab pi rakhi thi or aadhi raat ko sadak par sharaab pikar hangaamaa karne ke jurm main hi unhen thane main laayaa gaya tha
 However, the boy locked in the lockup later complained to the policemen that he was unnecessarily assaulted

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi's three-day visit to Israel is historic in many ways
 desh ke 70 varshon ke itihaas main bhartiya pradhanmantri kaa yah pehla isroyal daura he, jisamen donon deshon ke bich krishi, vigyaan, antariksh or jal prabandhan jaise ahm kshetron main kul 7 samjhaute hue
 During his visit, PM Modi spoke of taking the bilateral relationship to new heights in the future while underlining the distance from the previous governments of India
 dabe-chupe rahe hai bharat-isroyal sambandhyaha gaur karne vaali baat yah he kiisroyal se rajanyik sambandhonmen garmjoshi purv pradhanmantri pivi narsimha raav ke daur main shuru hui
 Even then, the relations between the two countries remained hidden
 aise main sawaal uthta he ki aakhir bharat is pashchim asian desh se khule rishte main yun kataraata kyon rahaa
 
 isroyal se duuri ke peeche ye do tarkijaroyal se mail-milaap main is sankoch ke peeche do tark bataae jate hai
 The first is the fear of tension in India's relations with Arab countries close to this Jewish country, the second is the resentment of the country's Muslim population
 darasal muslim rashtron se ghire isroyal se arab deshon ke rishte hameshaa hi katutaa bhare rahe hai
 The Arab world has been opposing the establishment of Israel from the very beginning and attacked it soon after the establishment of Israel in the year 1948
 haalanki arab deshon kaa vah hamalaa naakaam rahaa, lekin unke bich kii dushmani khatm nahin hui
 Important change in Indian policy regarding West Asia: PM Modi's visit to Israel is being seen as a significant change in Indian policy regarding West Asia
 isse pehle jab bhi koi bhartiya rajaneta isroyal gaye, to unhone iske saath hi philistin kaa bhi daura kiya
 In the midst of years of confrontation between Israel and Palestine, the Government of India has been trying to ensure that it is not countered by any one
 aise main piem modi ke akeleisroyal yatraase jahaan kai samrik phaayde ginaae ja rahe hai, to vahiin kuch nuksaan kii bhi ashanka he
 First of all, India is still very much dependent on the Gulf countries for their energy needs
 aise main agar isroyal se bharat kii dosti se agar arab desh khafa hote hai, to bharat ko iske dushprinaam jhelane pad sakate hai
 The employment of about 8 million Indians is associated with the Gulf, and a large part of India's foreign capital reserves come from these Arab countries
 ek anumaan ke mutabik, kareeb 80 lakh bhartiya rojgaar ke liye khadi deshon par nirbhar hai or vahaan se apane vetan kaa bada hissaa apane parivaar ke paas bharat bhejte hai
 In such a situation, resentment of Arab countries can prove harmful for these families
 philistin ke paksh main khadaa rahaa he bharatyahan gaur karne vaali baat yah he ki isroyal-philistin ke jhagade main bharat hameshaa hi philistin ke paksh main khadaa dikhaa
 India had also opposed the proposal for the formation of Israel
 vahiin bharat-pakistan ke bich tanaav ke maahaul main arab deshon ne bhi dosti kaa khyal rakhte hue kabhi pakistan kii khuli tarafdaari nahin kii or naa hi kashmir vivaad main hastkshep kii baat kahi
 Arab has been helpful to India on the international stage, apart from this, whenever India was found surrounded on the international stage, it helped it openly there
 aise main bharat dwaara is tarah philistin intefada (jan andolan) ko darkinar kar isroyal se dosti ke natijatan ashanka he ki arab desh bhi aise vivaadon kii sthiti main bharat ke paksh main khadaa hone se parhez kar sakate hai

 ' centre kii endie sarkaar main sahyogi shivasena ne uttarakhand main raashtrapati shashan ko lekar hue vivaad main centre sarkaar par nishaanaa saadhaa he
 In the editorial written in Saamana, the Shiv Sena has written that not only has the attire of the Central Government in this matter also damaged the reputation of the President
 shivasenaane lekh main likhaa he ki uttarakhand maamle main court kaa yah kahana he ki raashtrapati se nirnay main galati hui
 This means that there was a mistake from the Modi government
 saamana main likhaa he ki aakhirkaar modi sarkaar ne is faisle par muhar apane raajnneetik swaarth ke kaaran hi lagaaya tha lekin adaalat ne ye koshish naakaam kar di
 Significantly, the Nainital High Court rejected the central government's decision to impose President's rule in Uttarakhand and asked the Harish Rawat government to prove its majority in the Assembly on April 29
 iske saath hi hai court ne congress ke 9 baagi vidhayakon kii sadsyta bhi khatm karne ke spikar ke faisle ko sahi kaha tha
 The central government will challenge this decision in the Supreme Court
 bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne shanivaar ko kaha ki bihar ko vishesh rajya kaa darja dilaanaa unki pehali praathamikta he

 In such a situation, it becomes the moral duty of the present government of the Congress-led Center to grant the status of a special state to Bihar without any delay
 mukhyamantri ne pradesh ke sabhi raajnneetik dalon se iske liye centre par dabaav banane ko kaha
 He said that Bihar holds all the qualifications to get special state status
 aise main ve centre se is bare main sakaaratmak drushtikon rakhane kii aashaa rakhte hai
 Nitish claimed that Bihar is on the path of continuous development on its own and if it gets special state status, it will pave the way for all-round development of the state

 The meeting between the Patidar Reservation Committee and Congress leaders on the issue of reservation was inconclusive
 der raat 3 ghante tak chali marothan baithak main sanvaidhanik taur par congress kis tareeke se aarakshan degi is vishay patidaar netaaon ne sawaal uthaae
 After this, Congress leader Kapil Sibal, who was talking to the Patidars on behalf of the Congress and the other leaders had to have a separate meeting
 yah baithak benatija rahane se abhi bhi patidaaron se congress ko milane vaale samarthan kii ghoshnaa karne kii baat ek or mulaakaat ke liye aage tal gai he
 Every effort is being made by the Congress to take advantage of the resentment of the bjp's vote bank in Gujarat
 or ho bhi kyon naa? 50 siton par patidaaron kaa kabja he
 Patidars' inclination or resentment can improve or spoil the mathematics of any political party
 isi silsile main congress ne aarakshan dene par bharosa diya to patidaar aarakshan samiti ke netaa congress mukhyalay mulaakaat ke liye pahunche the
 Interaction with Patidar leaders was given to the legal jurist and senior Congress leader Kapil Sibal
 baithak ke dauraan sibbal ke saath gujarat pradesh ke adhyaksh bhi maujuud the
 The Patidars raised the question that Congress should first clarify how constitutionally Congress can give reservation to Patidars
 congress ne jo formula diya tha wo patidaaron ke pasand nahin aayaa uske baad congress netaaon ko alag baithak kerani padi
 However, after the meeting, the Patidar leaders said that they met in a very good environment
 2 se 3 opshan congress ne bataae hai jis par pehle hardik se or baad main samaaj se charchaa karne ke baad faisla liya jayega ki congress ko samarthan den yaa nahin
 It is worth mentioning that the Congress high command was given the responsibility of senior leader Kapil Sibal to study what provisions should be made in the law to give constitutionally reservation to OBC or EBC
 sibbal ne is par ek khaakaa taiyaar karke isaki report congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ko de di thi
 Based on the same report, Kapil Sibal met the Patidar leaders
 sibbal ne bataaya ki mulaakaat se kya raste ban sakate hai un baton par charchaa hui
 The Patidars have asked to clear the stand on the issue of support in the next two days
 lekin isse pehle bhi ek or mulaakaat hogi jo aarakshan ke mudde par bani dhundhlee chhavi ko saaf karegi

 The accident occurred around 2 am when Naidu's car collided with an oil tanker near Ranasthalam in Srikakulam district of north coastal Andhra, about 700 km from Hyderabad

 Film and politics have had an interesting relationship in the history of Azad India till now
 khaskar filmi sitaron ke bina dakshin bharat ke raajnneetik itihaas kii kalpana bhi nahin kii ja sakati
 There are more than half a dozen leaders in the southern states who have attained the top position in politics
 party ke shikhar par bhi pahunche
 However, this is completely opposite in the rest of India
 aisa nahin he ki desh main dakshin ke baahar filmi sitaron ne raajnneeti main mukaam hasil nahin kiya
 Leaders like Vinod Khanna, Shatrughan Sinha were also seen at the pinnacle of politics
 lekin itihaas yah bhi bataata he ki shesh bharat main lokapriy or sthaneey netaaon ko haraane ke liye filmi sitaron kaa sahaara liya gaya
 Former Prime Minister of India Atal Bihari Vajpayee also believes in something similar
 raajnneeti main filmi sitaron ke pravesh kaa virodh karne vaale vaajapeyi ne kaha tha, "raajnneetik netaaon ko haraane ke liye abhinaytaon kaa sahaara liya gaya
 "however, no actor has ever beaten Vajpayee in the political arena
 jabaki lakhanu sansadeey seat kaa pratinidhitiv karne vaale atalji ke raajnneetik kariyar main aise do bade maukey aae jab chunaavon main kaddavar filmi sitaron se unki bhidnt thi
 When Indira had flown on TV to flop Atal's rally Bobby! BJP fought Lok Sabha elections from 1996 to 2004 by making Atal ji face for the post of Prime Minister and achieved remarkable success
 1996 main vaajapeyi sabase bade dal / gathbandhan ke taur par party ko satta dilaane main to kaamyaab rahe, lekin 13 din kii unki sarkaar vishwasamat hasil nahin kar pai
 His government fell, later HD Deve Gowda and Indra Kumar Gujral led the United Front government with the support of the Congress
 haalanki pradhanmantri badalane ke baavjood sanyukt morcha kii sarkaar bhi apana kaarykaal nahin puraa kar pai
 Click here to pay tribute to Vajpayee, at that time, there was only one voice coming from all over the country for the post of Prime Minister
 aisa lag rahaa tha ki agar puure desh main pradhanmantri ke liye vot maange jaae to vaajapeyi ko chunauti dene vaala koi nahin hai
 Actually, every man from every corner of the country - wanted to see Vajpayee ji as the Prime Minister
 chunaav se pehle vaajapeyi ajey lag rahe the
 The BJP had high hopes from Uttar Pradesh for its success
 aisa hona swaabhaavik bhi tha
 Because of the Ram Mandir movement and Vajpayee, in the last few years, Uttar Pradesh had become the only state from where the maximum number of mps of BJP came
 us vakt congress kii parampara kaa anusaran karte hue uttar pradesh main vaajapeyi or bijepi ko rokane ke liye samaajawaadee party, congress or basapa ne apane-apane str par bada game plan taiyaar kiya
 Needless to say that the Congress had fielded Bollywood's biggest megastar Amitabh Bachchan to defeat Hemwati Nandan Bahuguna, considered one of the most popular and powerful strategists and leaders of UP
 amitabh kii vajah se ek lokapriy netaa ko chunaav main sharmnaak haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Later, the defeat became the reason for their political end and the film stars became a weapon to crack the ground of popular leaders in Indian politics
 vaajapeyi kii lokapriyata se tang vipaksh ne kai saal baad aisi hi yojana upi main bhi banaai
 The plan was that why not field a strong candidate against Vajpayee and encircle the Lucknow parliamentary seat
 aisa hone kii sthiti main vaajapeyi apni jeet sunishchit karne ke liye zyaadaatar vakt lakhanu main hi fanse rahenge
 And if he loses the election, bjp's balloon will burst with Vajpayee
 jab atal ne lata se kaha-main tumhaare hospital ke liye dua nahin karuunga1998 main samaajawaadee party ne vaajapeyi ke khilaaf film nirmaataa mujffar ali ko lakhanu main apana ummidavaar banaaya
 Muzaffar was a local candidate for Lucknow
 sansadeey kshetra main unke bahut gharelu tallukaat the, or wo filmon kaa glamras cheharaa to the hi
 Lucknow was noticed by poet, social activist and filmmaker Muzaffar, who made famous films like 'umrao Jaan' and 'gaman'
 mujffar ke samarthan main kai filmi sitare bhi aae
 But Vajpayee trusted his Lucknow
 wo chunavi campagne main vaise hi shaamil hue jaise pehle hua karte the
 History failed to repeat itself
 vaajapeyi ko gheraa nahin ja sakaa
 Needless to say that Lucknow, famous for its style, did not like to pay attention to anyone else at the cost of Vajpayee
 mujffar ko baari antar se haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 The BJP also got historic seats in UP
 vaajapeyi pradhanmantri bane
 Six years later in 2004, Samajwadi Party had once again made a similar plan by fielding Raj Babbar
 is baar chunaav se pehle vipaksh thodaa baari bhi najar aa rahaa tha
 Congress as a soft Hindutva face with Mahsuur Dr
 karn singh ko vaajapeyi ke khilaaf ummidavaar banaaya
 At the same time, the BSP fielded Satish Chandra Mishra as the Brahmin face
 lekin is baar bhi lakhanu kii janata ne apane sabase priy netaa par hi bharosa jataana munasib samajha
 Despite the presence of strong strategy, film stars and powerful candidates, Vajpayee brilliantly managed to achieve Vijay Sri
 to amitabh se ladane ke liye rekha ko bulaate vaajapeyivipaksh filmi sitaron ke jariye vaajapeyi ko haarane kii koshish karata rahaa
 In an interview, Vajpayee himself said that Amitabh was also reported to be contesting against him
 vaajapeyi ne kaha tha, "agar main dilli se chunaav ladata to sambhavat: mere khilaaf amitabh bhi ummidavaar ho sakate the
 "vajpayee was asked, how do you compete with Amitabh then? Vajpayee replied," i can't face the actors
 mujhe rekha se vinati kerani hoti
 "by the way, Vajpayee has been opposing film stars to enter politics
 lekin unke netritv main bijepi se dharmendra, vinod khanna or shatrughna sinha jaise kai chote-bade abhinayta sansad main pahunche
 Vinod Khanna and Shatrughan Sinha also became ministers in his cabinet
 mausam vibhaag ne bihar or sikkim main baari barish kii ashanka ke maddenjar red warning jari kar di he
 According to the Meteorological Department, from 19 July to 22 July, there may be heavy rains in all areas of Bihar
 jaankaron ke mutabik, uttari bihar main jhamajhambarishaki sambhaavna kuch zyada hi he
 With this, the possibility of torrential rain has also deepened in the areas of Nepal adjoining Bihar
 isliye mausam vibhaag ne sthaneey prashasan ko satark kar diya he
 Along with this, Red Warning has been issued from 19 July to 22 July in Sikkim, in view of the possibility of excess rain at many places
 24 ghante main himalay kii talahati main pahunch jayega monsoon kaa akshais samaymanasoon kaa akamritsar, karnal, bareli, gorakhpur, patna, malda hota hua manipur se hokar guzar rahaa he
 The axis of the monsoon will reach the foothills of the Himalayas in the next 24 hours
 isse uttar-pashchim bharat main monsoon kii barish main kami aa jaaegi, lekin isi ke saath purvi or purvothar bharat main jhamajham barish kaa daur shuru ho jayega
 While on one side the axis of monsoon is reaching the foothills of the Himalayas, on the other hand a circulation of moist winds from the Bay of Bengal is made over Bihar
 is cirkulation se monsoon kii nam hawaaen bihar or sikkim ke saath-saath pashchim bengal ke uphimalayan kshetron main ghaney badal paidaa kar dengi
 With this, the possibility of starting a period of rains in this entire area from July 19 will increase
 assam-meghalaya main hogi joardaar barishmausam vibhaag ke mutabik, agle 24 ghante assam or meghalaya ke liye khatarnaak hai, kyonki is dauraan in donon rajyon main kai jagah musaladhar barish hone kii khaasi sambhaavna he
 After 24 hours, the risk of very heavy rains will be reduced for both these states from the 20th, but after this, rain will start from 7 to 12 cm in most places in the northeastern states
 mausam vibhaag kaa kahana he ki agle saat din purvottar rajyon main monsoon kii acchhee barish record kii jaaegi

 The trailer of Dera Sacha Sauda head Ram Rahim's film MSG (the Messenger of God) may have been liked by more than 21 lakh people, but the censor board is not passing the film
 board ne ab apni teesri kamity tribunel ko film par faisalaa lene ke liye kaha he
 This became a mutual opinion after watching the film of the 10 member censor board's revising committee in Mumbai
 revising kamity kii berd kii sadsy nandini saradesai ne kaha, 'deraa sachcha sauda ke ram rahim kii film vivaadon se bhari he
 The film is awesome in terms of graphic and technique, but if such stunts were done by a Superman or spider-man, the film could have been appreciated, but we feel that this film can hurt the feelings of many
 isliye ab hamaari teesri kamity yani 'tribunel' hi iskaa faisalaa karegi
 The censor board also said in its statement that no religion was criticized in the film, but Baba Ram Rahim is seen curing deadly diseases with his magic
 sensor board ke mutabik, unki film kaiyon kii bhavanaon ko thens pahunchaa sakati he, lihaaza ritred jajon se bani sensor board kii teesri kamity film par aakhri faisalaa legi
 At the same time, the Ministry of Home Affairs has clearly stated in its advisory that if the film is released, the law and order situation in Punjab and Haryana may deteriorate
 ram rahim par gumraah karne kaa aarope lagaate hue is film ke khilaaf punjab or haryana main sikhon kaa pradarshan bhi dekha gaya
 Meanwhile, the film's writer, director, producer and head of Dera Sacha Sauda Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh said that scenes which the censor board has objected to, can be cut by the censor board

 Today is the auspicious day of Dhanteras and gold and silver people do a lot of shopping on the occasion of this festival
 agar aapako bhi is shubh maukey par kuch lenaa he to jaan len ki pichley saal kii tulana main is baar sone-chaandi ke daam kareeb 3 hajaar rupee tak bad gaye hai
 This year the bullion market has more inflation than last year
 agar aankadon main baat karen to sone ke bhav sidhe teen hajaar rupee prati 10 gram bad gaye to vahiin chaandi bhi 3500 rupee prati kilogram mahangi hui he
 However, there is some difference in their prices in different cities
 jaane kis bazaar main he kya ratedilli main sone ke daam29,100 rupee prati 10 gram he
 This is the price of gold of 22 carat purity
 vahiin dilli main 24 carat sone kii keemat ke daam 31,123 rupee prati 10 gram hai
 Gold prices in Mumbai are slightly higher than Delhi
 yah 22 carat ke liye 29,600 rupee prati 10 gram he
 The price per 10 gam of 24 carats is Rs 31,658
 kolkata main 22 carat sona prati 10 gram 29,310 rupee ke rate main hai
 However in Chennai it is cheaper than in these cities
 chennai main 10 gram (22 carat) sona 28,590 rupee ke rate par mil rahaa he
 The price of 24 carat gold in Kolkata is Rs 31,348 per 10 grams, while in Chennai it is available at a rate of Rs 30,578
 vahiin chaandi kaa rate prati kilogram 42,500 rupee he
 If you want to take gold and silver coins on Dhanteras, gold and silver coins are purchased a lot on this day
 agar aapako sone kaa sikaa lenaa he to iskaa rate lagbhag 16,436 rupee prati 5 gram he
 At the same time, the rate of 10 grams of gold coin will be about 33 thousand rupees
 aise hi 20 gram ke sikke kii keemat 65 hajaar rupee ke kareeb he
 Please tell that these rates are from the MMTC, a government body and VAT and other taxes have not been added to it
 vahiin chaandi ke sikke lene hai to 10 gram ke sikke kii keemat kareeb 550 rupee rahegi or 20 gram kaa chaandi kaa sikaa kareeb 1100 rupee kaa padegaa
 Along with buying for yourself, you can also give it to someone as an omen or gift
 nakal se rahen saavdhaan, aise pahachaanen sona khara he yaa milavati -dhanteras par sone or chaandi kii kharidari khub hoti he to usee ke saath hi milawat or chorbazari bhi
 To avoid this, do real gold test-1
 sona kharidte samay kisi pin kii sahaayta se sone par halkaa sa kharoch lagaaein or phir us par nitric acid kii ek boond daalen
 Fake gold will immediately turn green
 2
 Do a water test to check the purity of gold
 ek cap pani len or usamen sone ko dubaaen, agar sona pani ke cap main dubega to wo asli he
 3
 ceremic plate yaa chini mitti kii plate par sone ko ragad kar denkhe agar golden line banati he to aapkaa sona sahi he
 4
 bharat main biies sanstha upabhoktaaon ko uplabdh karaae ja rahegunvattta str kii jaanchakarti he, isliye biies hollmark dekhakar hi sona khareednaa chahie
 Identify the exact price of gold when buying gold, it is bought at a price of 24 carats, while gold ornaments are bought at 22 carats, which is very low
 isliye jab bhi sona khariden to 24 carat sone ke bhav main 24 kaa bhaag den or 22 se guna karen isse aapako 22 carat sone kikimat pataa chalajaaegi
 Identify genuine silver in such a way that silver is adulterated more than gold, so it is important to take care of its purchase as well
 chaandi kharidte samay ise pathar se ragaden agar lakeer safed rang kii dikhaai de to chaandi shuddh he
 If this streak is yellow, then it has adulteration of copper, zinc and aluminum

 In this episode, on Wednesday, Lok Sabha in-charge Raghav Chadha of Aam Aadmi Party from South Delhi started an auto rickshaw campaign
 aam aadmi party ne auto rickshaw par poster chipkaakar logon se judane kii apil kar rahi he
 AAP leader Raghav Chadha said during an interaction with Aaj Tak that auto drivers have always been the backbone of Aam Aadmi Party's campaign
 auto chaalak na sirf AAP ke poster chipka rahe hai, balki auto main baithne vaali har sawari ko jhaadu kaa batan dabaane kii vajah bhi bataa rahe hai
 Raghav Chadha alleged that the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Congress Party put up huge hoardings for the expenditure of Rs 10 lakh per month, while the Aam Aadmi Party is promoting by putting up a poster of just Rs 10
 is campagne ke shuruyaat main 1,000 poster dakshin dilli ke auto main lagaae ja chuke hai

 After three days of smokeless election campaign in UP, PM Modi reached Gujarat on a two-day mission without missing a single day
 samarthakon ne bina thake hue kaam karne kaa piem kaa anokhaa andaaj bataaya to virodhiyon ne kila bachaane kii majaburi
 We look at the 5 reasons for which up's victory is important for BJP and Modi
 1
 It is important for BJP to win the referendum on demonetisation election because people will take up's mandate as public opinion on demonetization decision
 haal ke sthaneey nikaay chunaavon main safalataa ko bijepi ne notebandi par samarthan ke rup main prachaarit kiya
 But the election of the country's largest state UP will be the first major election where the decision of demonetisation will be tested
 isamen agar bijepi jitati he to notebandi ko janata ke green signal ke rup main prachaarit karegi lekin alag chunaav main bijepi kaa pradarshan thik nahin rahata he to vipakshi dalon ke paas aadhaar mil jayega ye kehane kaa ki janata ne notebandi ke khilaaf vot kiya
 2
 2019 kii semifinalupi samet 5 rajyon kaa chunaavbijepi ke liye 2019 ke aam chunaavse pehle semifinal mana ja rahaa he
 If the BJP manages to grab power in the largest state of the country, then the policies of this Modi government will be considered a victory
 lekin agar bijepi upi kii satta se dur rah jaati he to baaki rajyon main aage aane vaale chunaavon main bhi iskaa asar hoga
 After a bitter defeat in the Delhi and Bihar elections, up's victory for BJP will be similar to Sanjivani's
 3
 The Rajya Sabha's arithmetic may be in power in the Lok Sabha on its own, but lack of majority in the upper house of the Rajya Sabha is a major hindrance in implementing its policies
 tamaam aise vidheyak hai jo loksabhaa se paas hokar rajyasabha main jaakar atak jate hai
 Then the BJP has to take the opposition parties together
 upi se sabase zyada rajyasabha kii 30 siten hai
 In such a situation, by winning in the biggest state of UP, BJP will also want to change the equation of Rajya Sabha so that it can be comfortable in implementing its policies
 4
 The challenge of the presidential election is to elect the president before 25 July 2017
 isamen jite ke liye bijepi ke liye upi kii jeet bahut jaruri he
 UP is very important in the election of President
 yahaan se 403 vidhayak,30 rajyasabha sadsy or vidhaan parishadki 100 siten hai
 This is the importance of UP in the presidential election
 centre kii satta main hote hue agar bijepi raashtrapati chunaav main apane candidet nahin jeeta paati to uske liye pratishtha kii ladaai ban jaaegi
 Therefore, the victory of UP is also necessary for him
 5
 To implement GST, the government is required to implement Goods and Services Tax i
e
 GST from 1 July
 desh ke aarthik vyavastha main ye bada badlaav hoga
 States will play a big role in this
 gaiyr bijepi shasit rajyon kii ore se kai muddon par virodh ke swar bhi uthenge
 In such a situation, the BJP would like to keep its voice elevated by winning in the biggest state UP
 modi sarkaar jiesti ko ek bade aarthik sudhaar ke rup main pesh kar rahi he or upi jitkar vah apni aawaaj or buland kerani chaahegi

 In the 2012 elections, Narendra Modi got a chance to form the government in the state for the third time, winning a total of 116 seats

 Although BJP has been getting a kind of walkover from the opposition in many seats in Gujarat, but this time some political pundits are claiming that the situation has changed for BJP
 rajya main congress se badhati ummid, do dashak kii antiinakambency, patel aarakshan andolan, alpesh thakor kaa obisi netritv or jignesh mawane ke netritv main chal rahaa nayaa dalit andolan milakar congress ke liye dashakon baad ek adarsh sthiti paidaa kar rahaa he
 But whether only this ideal situation is sufficient to change it will be known only on 18 December
 ise bhi padhein: gujaratah gharelu maidan or sabase mufeed pich par kyon sangharsh kar rahi he bjp?bijepi kaa daawa he ki use 120 siton se adhik par jeet milane ja rahi he
 At the same time, Amit Shah is talking about winning the 150 seats by beating the tal
 congress se ahamed patel bhi 110 siton par jeet dekh rahe hai
 Most of the poll surveys have said that the BJP is in a strong position, saying that it is a contest of thorns
 vahiin sarvokshanon ke surveykshan main bijepi ko mushkil se 92 siton kaa aankada paar karte dekha ja rahaa he
 Electronic voting machines (evms) are also becoming infamous during the elections and all efforts of the Election Commission are not seen to be effective in stopping this infamy
 is baar iviem main vivipat (voter ko raseed dene kii suvidha) laga hua he jisase voter ko jaankaree mil sake ki uskaa vot usee party ko gaya he jiske liye usne batan dabaaya tha
 Despite this, with many cases of EVM malfunctions being filed, the Election Commission is saying that some 24 thousand evms being used, some will be disturbed

 Surat area of south Gujarat has been at the center of opposition from businessmen upset with Patel reservation movement and then demonetisation and GST
 surat rajya main textile kaarobaar kaa kendra hone ke saath-saath desh kaa doimund polish kaa hub he
 Businessmen of this region have been supporting BJP for a long time, but this time their opposition can cause the fortunes of Congress to shine
 vahiin patel aarakshan andolan bhi nateezon ko palatney main behad ahm bhoomika nibhaa sakate hai kyonki surat patelon kaa majboot garh bhi he
 After Surat, Saurashtra is the second important region where both parties are claiming a big upset
 is kshetra main bhi patel votaron kaa varchasv he or andolan ke dauraan 12 patelon kii jaan bhi ja chuki he
 Hence the Patel reservation movement in this region has been extremely aggressive and full of violence
 is kshetra main patelon ne bijepi sarkaar ko andolankariyon kii maut ke liye jimmedaar tehraata hue use sabak sikhaane kaa daawa kiya he
 However, some reports claim that BJP has been able to convince a large section of the BJP, so there is little possibility of any big upsurge in favor of Congress
 baharhaal, congress dwaara is kshetra main bhi kuch apratyaashit karne kii baat ko nakaara nahin ja saktaa he
 In the desert region like Kutch, support to the BJP is expected to continue for two important reasons
 maujuuda samay ke votaron ke bich 2001 main aae bukamp ke baad punaranirmaan kii bijepi sarkaar kii uplabdhiyaan badi vajah he
 At the same time, with the arrival of Narmada water in this area, the expectation of voters from Prime Minister Modi has increased
 votaron kaa maananaa he ki aane vaale dinon main pradhanmantri modi kii koshishon se kshetra main tourism ko bada badha dekhne ko mil saktaa he
 While the campaign for the Gujarat elections started with the development of the Congress and the slogan of bjp's Main Vikas Hoon, it was just a heated debate between the two parties and there was no significant impact on the voters
 vahiin sampradayikta kaa jhatka chunaavon main doosraa mudda he jisamen donon partiyaan apni-apni bhoomika adaa kar rahe hai
 The issue of Ayodhya to Pakistan has been hot in the elections

 While Congress and BJP are trying to win the battle in evms, there is a village that has boycotted the entire electoral process

 ’ The hotel's refusal, police sealed and sent for investigation, said Samplesf - that meat may be hard but not a beef
 There was a ruckus at a large restaurant in Gomtinagar in Lucknow
 vahaan khaanaa khaane aae ek parivaar ne restaurant par aarope lagaaya ki un logon ne matan kaa order diya tha lekin unhen bif parosa gaya
 At the same time, the people of the restaurant say that when this family was served a big piece of mutton, it created an uproar by calling it Beef
 forensik jaanch kar rahi timaye maamla itnaa bad gaya ki police ko is baat kii puri jaankaree di gai
 As soon as the information was received, the police reached the restaurant and took cognizance of the matter
 jiske baad police ne forensik jaanch team ko phone kar bulaayaa
 The forensic investigation team sealed the samples of the meat and sent it for investigation
 parivaar ne lagaaya bif parosane kaa aaropjankaree ke mutabik lakhanu ke gomti nagar ke mal main ek bade restaurant main gomti nagar kaa parivaar khaanaa khaane ke liye gaya tha
 During this time he ordered the meat of Mutton
 parivaar kaa kahana he ki matan kaa gosht parosa gaya or use khaane ke baad pataa chalaa ki vah bif he
 He says he complained to the restaurant manager after finding a big bone in the beef but he did not agree
 haalanki iske baad police or jaanch team ko phone kiya gaya
 The police, who reached the spot, checked the food sample and sealed it
 saath hi sample ko jaanch ke liye aage bhej diya
 The restaurant chef says, "they did not serve beef
" isaki vah 110 percent guarantee lete hai
 Instead of mutton, it can be hard ie big goat but it is not beef
 'police kar rahi maamle kii jaanchpeedit aarushi verma ne kaha, 'ham log yahaan khaanaa khaane aae the kyonki maine yahaan party di thi
 But as soon as the meat was served our father came to know that there was a big deficiency because he had an idea and i had no idea
 usamen itani badi si haddi nikali, jise dekh hamen andaja hua
 We want to take action against these people because we have eaten here, but the people coming should be aware of this
 philhal police puure maamle kii jaanch kar rahi he
 ' dendi par bana emsidi toll noida se dilli jane waalon ke liye bada khatra ban gaya he
 There is no time from Sabuh till night when people do not have to face traffic jam due to MCD toll
 pichley paanch dinon se alag-alag samay par 'ajtak' kii team jab emsidi toll par jayja lene pahunchi, to toll par roke gaye trakon kii bheed ne car chaalkon ko kaaphi pareshaan kiya
 The South MCD has arbitrarily set up a toll booth on the middle road to collect taxes from commercial vehicles
 dilli se noida or noida se dilli jane waalon ke liye dendi toll kaa free hona ek badi khushkhabari thi
 The DND toll was made tax free on 26 October 2016 due to the increasing problem of traffic jams, but the joy for people going from Noida to Delhi did not last long
 free ho chuke dendi toll se kuch hi duuri par jaise hi dilli kii sarhad shuru hoti he, emsidi kaa toll booth logon kaa baari trephic jam ke saath swaagat karata he
 Trucks passing through the MCD toll are stopped on the beach road
 toll karmchaaree jis andaaj main trakon ko rokte hai, ve aasapaas se guzarane vaale chote vaahanon ke liye musiibat ban jate hai
 When an army of toll-booth workers on the middle road suddenly stops the trucks, the risk of collision with the vehicles coming behind them increases significantly
 emsidi toll booth par toll karmchaaree trakon ko rokane ke liye dandon kaa istemaal bhi karte hai, jo yahaan se guzarane vaali taxi main safar kar rahe logon main bhay bhi paidaa karata he
 Actually, there are 4 lanes on the road going from Noida to Delhi, where the MCD has built a toll booth in one lane of the road
 jabaki 2 len main trakon se tex vasula jaataa he
 Surprisingly, neither there are adequate lighting at the toll booths at night nor CCTV cameras are installed at the toll booths
 south emsidi dwaara chalaae ja rahe toll booth par adhure intjaam bhi kai sawaal khadey karte hai
 Let us also see the picture of traffic jam on DND in the evening
 subah, dopaher or shaam ke baad jab 'ajtak' kii team raat 1 baje dendi ke emsidi toll booth par pahunchi to kaaphi hairaan karne vaali tasviren camere main qaid huin
 The Delhi Police personnel sitting with the staff at the toll booth disappeared after seeing the camera
 bich sadak main teble or kursi par baithkar mithe aam kaa lutf le rahe dilli police ke 2 jawan camera dekhte hi nadaarad ho jate hai
 The idea of getting rid of the news camera was that a policeman who had forgotten his helmet on the table sent a toll employee to take the helmet
 ab sawaal yah uthta he ki dilli police ke sipaahi toll booth se aanan-fanan main kyon bhaage?sawaal yah bhi uthta he ki kya dilli pulistol boothke aasapaas lagane vaale trephic jam ko nazarandaaj kar rahi he? ye sawaal isliye kyonki jab trephic jam lagata he tab trephic police ke jawan maukey se gaayab nazar aate hai
 When Aajtak asked South MCD leader Sadan Shikha Rai about the problem coming from the tax collection booth in the middle of the road on DND, the answer was very avoidable
 unka kahana he ki toll lenaa he, to booth to rahegaa hi
 If people are facing problems, we will consider it and see if a replacement point is found
 south emsidi philhal meyar or kamishnar se milakar samasya kaa samaadhaan nikaalane kii baat kar rahi he, lekin daawey khokhale nazar aa rahe hai
 The Rashtriya Janata Dal has alleged that in the CBI investigation of the creation of more than 1000 crores Mahaghotale, action is being taken only on small fish and an FIR is being registered against them
 rajd kaa maananaa he ki is mahaghotaale ke taar satta paksh ke bade-bade netaaon se jude hai, lekin uske baavjood bhi sibiai in netaaon ke khilaaf koi bhi kadaa kadam nahin uthaa rahi he
 Questioning the CBI probe into the creation of Mahaghhotale, RJD spokesperson Shakti Singh Yadav alleged that Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi were directly involved in the entire scam and that both of them, while in power, have an impartial investigation into this grand scam
 Impossible
 rajd kii taraf se kaha gaya ki bihar sarkaar ke sangyaan main rahane ke baavjood bhi is puure ghotaale par sarkaar ne dhyaan nahin diya balki lut kii chhot dekar sarkari khajaane ko lutaaya gaya he
 On this, Shakti Singh Yadav said that the CBI is promptly investigating against Rashtriya Janata Dal Supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav and his family members
 The CBI shows laxity and the biggest example of this is the Vyapam scam of Madhya Pradesh
 rajd ne kaha agar sibiai kaa istemaal apane logon or gathbandhan ke saathiyon ko bachaane ke liye kiya jayega to is sanstha kii saakh par batta laganaa tay he
 Shakti Singh Yadav said that the investigation of the creation Mahaghotale of Bhagalpur has been suppressed and denied all kinds of attention, allowing the creation of wealth from the creation case
 rajd ne maang kii he ki sibiai is puure maamle kii nishpakshta se jaanch kare or sajeeshkartaaon ko bhi jald namjad abhiyukt banaakar unke khilaaf praathmiki darj karen
