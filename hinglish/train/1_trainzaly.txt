 Please tell that Asthana's father Himanshu Kumar is an IAS rank officer and was the Principal Secretary of the UP government at that time

 pashchim bengal ke raajnneetik itihaas or maujuuda gathbandhanon ko dekhte hue is baat kii 60 fisadi sambhaavna he ki mamata banerjee mukhyamantri ke rup main lagaataar duusari baar jeet darj karengi
 Voting is going on for the assembly elections in six phases in the state
 congress-left gathbandhan kii jeet ke asaar 40 pratishat hai
 But everything depends on the ups and downs of the votes, even if only by a small margin
 mamata banerjee kii party trinmul congress se agar teen fisadi voton kaa jhukaav congress-left gathbandhan kii ore ho jaataa he, to yah gathbandhan 294 siton main se 149 siten hasil kar thodaa 'kamjor' bahumat juta saktaa he or trinmul 129 siton par simat sakati he
 Similarly, the additional inclination of two per cent votes towards Trinamool could give Mamta's party more than 200 seats
 mamata banerjee kii party 2011 ke vidhansabha chunaav main congress ke saath milakar ladi thi
 In this election, the Trinamool Congress won 184 seats, while the Congress won 42 seats
 dashakon se is rajya main satta par kabiz rahe vamadal ko us saal karaari maat jhelni padi thi or use sirf 62 siten hasil hui thim
 Mamta Banerjee parted ways with the Congress until the 2014 general elections and she continued to grow stronger in the state
 unki party ne rajya kii 42 loksabhaa siton main se 34 par vijay praapt kii thi
 The Congress and the Left contested separately, and both had an edge in the 28 assembly segments
 2014 ke aam chunaavon main bijepi ne pehali baar apni majboot upasthiti darj karai or vah do loksabhaa siton par kaamyaab rahi
 In 2011, the BJP was not a success and from that time it was engaged in strengthening its cadre in the state
 2014 main narendra modi kii lahar ke bich bijepi ne 12 fisadi maton kii badhat hasil kii, jo left ke voton main send sabit hui
 If the Left recovers half of that, or even six percent of the vote, it means that the congress-left alliance could gain 55 seats
 vipaksh kii ekajutata, jiskaa matlab he ki agar is baar left or congress ek-duusare ke vot na kaate to is baat se bhi is gathbandhan ko do saal pehle kii tulana main 41 siton kaa phayda ho saktaa he
 Together these two reasons can lead the left-congress to a majority
 2014 ke aam chunaavon ke dauraan donon partiyon saath milakar 56 vidhansabha siton par jeet sakati thim
 Had the two parties contested the elections at that time, they could have gained an edge in 97 assembly constituencies, although this would not have ended Trinamool domination
 lekin agar 2011 main donon ne saath chunaav ladaa hota, to shaayad mamata banerjee mukhyamantri nahin ban paatin

 President Pranab Mukherjee today warned the central government in the gestures that the constitution has been given the authority to issue ordinances, but it should be used only in special circumstances
 iaiti, enaiti or central uniwarsity ke chaatro or adhyapakon ke saath video conferencing ke zarie ek samvaad ke dauraan raashtrapati pranab mukherjee ne ye baat kahi
 The President said, 'in very compulsion and in case of certain needs, the framers of the Constitution considered it necessary to hand over some legislative authority in the form of ordinance to the executive
 jab vidhayika kaa satr na chal rahaa ho or halaat kanoon kii zarurat bataa rahe hon, tab ke liye
 The framers of the constitution also thought it necessary to limit this special right given to the government
 isliye tay samay seemaa main adhyadesh ko kanoon main badalane kaa praavdhaan bhi shaamil kar diya gaya
 In the last few months, the central government has introduced eight ordinances
 zaahir he, raashtrapati kaa ishaara udhar hi he
 However, the President also reminded the opposition of his duty
 unhone kaha, 'sansadeey loktantr kaa buniyadi siddhant ye he ki bahumat ko shashan karne kaa haq he jabaki vipaksh ko virodh karne, use benaqaab karne or agar sankhya ijazat de to sarkaar giraane kaa bhi haq he
 But in any case, the proceedings should not come to a halt
 ek hallaa karne vaale alpamat ko bahumat kii awaz band karne kii ijazat nahin honi chahie
 The President also warned the mps that the functioning of the Parliament has reduced considerably in the last decade and a half
 raashtrapati ne aankadon kaa hawala dete hue kaha ki pehali lok sabha apane paanch saal ke kaarykaal main 677 din baithi thi, jabaki terahavin lok sabha main 356 din, 14veen lok sabha main 332 din or 15veen lok sabha main 357 din hi kaam hua
 The President said that if the Parliament does not discharge its constitutional responsibility to make laws properly, then people will lose faith in them
 uttar pradesh ke kanpur jile main paariwarik ranjish ke chalate ek naaballig ladke ne das saal ke bachche kii gardan kaat kar hatya kar di
 Earlier he kidnapped the child
 vaardaat ke baad bheed ne aaropee ke ghar ko aag ke hawaale kar diya
 This bloody shock is from the town of Rawatpur in Kanpur
 jahaan sultanpuria gali main sabji vikreta samim khan kaa ghar he
 Her ten-year-old son Arsh Khan was a student of class 3
 beeti raat mohalle kaa 17 varshiya kishor sarfaraj arsh ko barhavafaat kii sajaavat dikhaane ke liye apane saath lekar gaya tha
 Sarfaraz meanwhile took Arsh to the forest of Armapur
 aarope he ki sarfaraj ne vahaan chaaku searsh kii gardan kaat kar shavjhaadiyon main chipa diya
 Later, he returned home and told the housemates that two youth riding a motorcycle had taken Arsh with them
 arsh ke gharavaalon ne is baat kii jaankaree police ko di
 The police immediately reached Sarfaraz's house for questioning
 police waalon ne paaya ki sarfaraj ke pair main khun ke dhabbe lage the
 The police became suspicious about this
 jab police ne sarfaraj se kadai se poochtacha kii, to usne apana jurm kabool kar liya
 The police recovered Arsh's corpse from the forest of Armapur on his spot
 is bich jaise hi yah khabar rawatpur main arsh ke gharavaalon ko lagi unhone sarfaraj ke ghar main todphod kar aag laga di
 The police and fire brigade controlled the fire with great difficulty
 kanpur ke espi (gramin) surendra tiwari ne bataaya ki arsh ke shav kaa postmortem hoga
 The accused was arrested late at night
 police usase poochtacha kar yah jaanane kii koshish kar rahi he ki is ghatana main kya koi or bhi shaamil tha
 SP Tiwari says that old rivalry between the two families is coming to light behind this incident
 police maamle kii jaanch kar rahi he
 Post mortem report of Arsh is also awaited
 wo kehete hai naa ki kai baar aapaki jubaan se zyada aapaki ankhen boltin hai
 Or rather, many times the gestures made by us are more than the words of the tongue
 kuch aisa hi hota he aapke patiyon ke saath bhi
 Many people are not able to openly say what they want to say or what is on their mind
 aise main wo apane saathi ko kuch aise ishaare dete hai jisase unki man kii baat ko samajha ja saktaa he
 We tell you what those gestures are, by seeing which you can know the thoughts of your husbands
 ankhon main chuphi hoti hai kai batenjab kai baar dimag main kuch baaten chal rahi hoti hai to wo ankhon se bayaan hone lagati hai
 Therefore women should try to read their husband's eyes
 isse aap pataa laga sakati hai ki aapke pati ke dimag main kya chal rahaa he
 It is believed that men first try to express their intentions with their eyes
 safai bhi jaruri haiye maani gai baat he ki acchhee khushboo mard ko aapaki taraf aakarshith karti he
 In such a situation, you have to take care of when your husband likes the scent
 shaam ko or rangeen banane ke liye koshish karen ki aap kisi aise parafum kaa istemaal karen jo aapke pati ko pasand ho
 Take special care of cleanliness also
 bahaane se chune kii koshishais dauraan kai baar aapke pati aapako bahane se chune kii koshish karte hai
 If your husband touches you with love, slaps your face or tries to touch soft limbs, then understand what his mind is pointing at
 agar wo is aapse dauraan sir maalish karne ke liye kehete hai to ye bhi aapke liye ek ishaara he
 If your husband starts helping in your work, your husband suddenly starts working according to your mind
 aapke gharelu kaam main aapaki madad karne lage yaa phir aapke saath baithkar aapkaa fevorett serial dekhne lage to samajhie ki aapke pati aaj kuch alag karne ke mood main hai

 In Cape Town, the destiny of Team India was written
 barish bhi nahin bachaa pai
 The third day's game was washed away in water
 lekin chauthe din jab capatoun main dhoop khili to laga ki maidan main bhi team india chamkegi
 As the South African batsmen got out on the fourth day, Indian fans along with Team India started dreaming of victory
 lekin sapana to tab sach hota jab bhartiya ballebaaj maidan main jeet ke iraade se utarate
 Strong batting 'failed' The fact that the bowlers had done their job to change the hope on the fourth day, now the number was of Indian batsmen, whose strength has always been heard
 top se lekar middle order tak aise-aise ballebaaj jo akele 208 ran ke lakshya ko bhed saktaa he
 But matches are won with strong intentions, not from a strong team, and he did not appear on the ground in Cape Town today
 shaayad sab yahi sochakar ballebaaji karne maidan par aa rahe the ki main nahin to mere baad vaale ballebaaj ye ran aasaani se bana legaa, aakhir scoreboard main ran jo keval 208 the
 We cannot just call the Indian team's defeat at Harkepstown in a hurry to score runs
 kyonki jeet ke liye chahie the 208 ran or dedh din se zyada kaa vakt bachaa hua tha
 Then there was a hurry to score runs among the Indian batsmen
 use dekhakar to yahi laga ki match jeetne ke iraade se kam, jald khatm karne ke liye khelaa ja rahaa tha
 Perhaps the target of 208 runs seemed to be low and the players were in the mood for a walk by tackling it in 'T20 style' soon
 aswin-bhuvi ne jagaai thi ummidahaalanki capatoun ke is pich par ran bananaa aasaan nahin tha, lekin ek vakt aar aswin or bhubaneshwar kumaar ne 49 ran kii partnership kar ek ummid jarur jagaai thi
 Even though Ashwin was out after scoring 37 runs
 lekin in donon kii ballebaaji ne top order kii kalai khol di
 When these two can survive on the pitch, then why not those whose work was to stay on the pitch? Not only this, it also felt that no one was going to tell the batsman that your job is not to score a run this time, only to stand at the crease
 is haar par to manthan jaruri?jis tarah se puri team 135 ran par simat gai usase saaf ho gaya keval pich ko doshi bataakar ballebaaj batch nahin sakate
 The batsman had a long time in front, only needed to stand at the crease
 jab krij par khadey rahete to ran apane aap judate jate
 In a way, this defeat is the result of victory in 'hasty victory'
 team india ko is manthan bhi karnaa chahie
 If you compare these figures with the runs and balls of Indian batsmen, then the picture will be clear that how quick the batsmen were
 murali vijay 32 gend main 13 ran, shikhar dhawan 20 gend main 16 ran, cheteshwar pujaara 13 gend main 4 ran, viraat kohli 40 gend main 28 ran, rohit sharma 30 gend main 10 ran, riddhimaan saaha 19 gend main 8 ran or hardik pandya 5 gend main mahaj ek ran banaakar out hue
 If one of the batsmen had tried to stick to the pitch, the results would have been different

 Gujarat also has a major influence in the politics of Bihar
 isliye argedy adhyaksh lalu prasad yadav ne kaha ki agar congress bulaaegi, to wo gujarat main jarur prachaar ke liye jaaenge
 Why did Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi keep quiet, he tweeted that Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi never shared the stage with Lalu Prasad Yadav, yet he is keen to go to Gujarat for campaigning in favor of Congress

 Where there was a blast in Amritsar on Sunday, Chief Minister Amarinder Singh was to go on Monday
 police or sthaneey prashasan ne unke swaagat main laal kaaleen bichaai thi, lekin maamla media main aane or vivaad badhane par ise hataakar hari kaaleen bicha di gai
 According to the information, Punjab Chief Minister had a press conference outside Nirankari Ashram in Amritsar
 iske liye red carpet bichaaya gaya tha
 It was later removed and the green carpet was laid
 gam ke is maahaul main swaagat kii is shahi parampara par jab police prashasan se sawaal poocha gaya to jawaab kaaphi chaunkaane vaala tha
 The police broke the forehead of the media and said that the request for laying the carpet was made on behalf of the media
 Red carpets put near blast site ahead of CM Amarinder Singh's visit have been withdrawn and green carpets now put out
 SSP Parampal Singh says' Media had asked for arrangements to be made, now media is saying why the arrangement
 This is not right
 Anyway, we have withdrawn them'pic

 com / 41ndmnr8zn— ANI (@ANI) November 19, 2018 Parmal Singh, SSP, Amritsar, told media persons, 'it was the media who had asked them to manage it
 ab media khud kah rahaa he ki isaki kya jarurat thi
 Such an attitude is not good
 'udhar, amritsar grenade hamale ke peeche iesai kii puri taiyaari lagbhag saaf ho chuki he
 According to Punjab Police Intelligence sources, the way Pakistan's intelligence agency ISI in Kashmir prepared the terrorists for a hand grenade attack and many such attacks took place, the same was also attacked in Amritsar
 kaha ja rahaa he ki ab usee tareeke ko iesai punjab main bhi khalistaani aatankiyon kii madad se lagu karne kii koshish main he
 According to the intelligence sources of the Punjab Police, it is easy to transport the hand grenade from one place to another and the impact of the blast from the hand grenade is so much that there is a blast and many people are also casualties
 saath hi hand grenade ke istemaal ke liye local yuvaaon ko training bhi soshal media or massenger eps ke jariye aasaani se de di jaati he
 For this reason, now hand grenade has become a new weapon of terror in Punjab and ISI has given responsibility to Kashmiri terrorist organizations to deliver hand grenade to Punjab
 videshon main baithe khalistaan samarthak khalistaani aatankiyon ko nirdesh he ki wo sikh yuvaaon ko bargala kar khalistaan kii muhim se joden or un tak paisa bhejein
 Something similar was to be done recently at the Patiala bus stand by terrorist Shabnam Deep Singh of Khalistan Ghadar Force caught at Patiala, but before that the Punjab Police caught him
 janata dal united ke adhyaksh nitish kumaar ne modi cabinet main shaamil na hokar dur kaa daanv khelaa he
 Their stakes can be very useful in the next year's assembly elections in Bihar
 mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne spasht kaha he ki bhavishya main bhi unki party kendriya mantrimandal main shaamil nahin hogi
 Assuming that there is no possibility of this till the assembly elections
 haalanki, nitish kumaar ne bhartiya janata party se kisi bhi naaraazgi ko sire se khaarij karte hue kaha ki bihar main ham saath milakar sarkaar chalaa rahe hai
 And it will have no effect on the 2020 assembly elections
 unhone kaha ki bihar main bhi gathbandhan kii pehle bhi or aaj bhi sarkaar chal rahi he
 What is the reason, not JDU in Modi cabinet? The reasons behind the rejection of Nitish's proposal for symbolic participation in Modi cabinet are very valid
 pehali to ye ki ek mantri ke sankethik rup se mantrimandal main shaamil hone kaa matlab he
 Pique within the party
 duusari sabase badi vajah ye he ki bijepi chunaav main is baar jo mudde lekar chali hai, unka virodh mantrimandal main shaamil hokar nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 Differences on issues between BJP-JDU There are differences on many issues between BJP and JDU
 loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan bijepi ne jo vaayade kiye hai chaahe wo dhara 370 ho yaa 35 e ho yaa phir uniform civil code ko lagu karana
 After Amit Shah became Home Minister, it is clear how serious the Modi government is about these issues
 jabaki jediu or nitish kumaar ko in muddon se parhez he
 The party had clearly stated during the last phase of elections that it is not with the BJP on these issues
 bijepi ke paas ab saal 2014 se bhi zyada prachand bahumat he
 Therefore, there will be no considerable challenge before the party to complete these issues
 aise main nitish kumaar kii sthiti kaaphi asahaj ho sakati thi
 They know that if it is not possible to resist all these issues by staying in the cabinet and if they have to come out of the cabinet, then the situation can get worse
 isliye wo lagaataar is baat par jor de rahe hai ki jediu kendriya mantrimandal main chaahe baahar he, lekin wo endie ke saath hai
 These issues can be opposed only by staying out of the government
 secular chhavi kaa nuksaan nahin chaahati jdubihara main jediu ne loksabhaa chunaav-2019 main jo siten jiti hai, unamem se 9 siten aisi hai jin par 2014 ke aam chunaavon main bijepi ko haar mili thi
 Out of those 9 seats, JDU won 8 seats this time and only one seat went to Kishanganj Congress
 inamen se zyaadaatar siten wo hai jin par alpsankhyakon kii sankhya acchhee khaasi he
 Therefore, JDU does not want to damage its secular image
 agar vidhansabha chunaav ke samay muddon ke aadhaar par agar gathbandhan kaa badlaav hota he to usamen bhi koi dikkat na ho
 There was talk of JDU joining the Union Cabinet on Thursday
 haalanki, shapath grahan samaaroh ke pehle nitish kumaar ne party ke mantrimandal main shaamil nahin hone kii ghoshnaa karte hue kaha tha ki modi nit mantralay main shaamil hone ke liye bijepi kii peshkash 'pratikatmak pratinidhitiv' he, jo jediu ko sweekaar nahin he
 He had said that everyone in the party is of the opinion that there should be no symbolic participation in the central government

 To review the strength and readiness of the Indian Navy, the presence of some countries and the absence of some in this review are also telling their own story
 pakistan yahaan nahin he, jabaki china pehali baar yahaan he
 Analysts see China's investment in Balochistan province's Gwadar Port, Sri Lanka's Hambantota Port and Bangladesh's Sonadia Deepwater Port in Pakistan as attempts by the Chinese to exert influence against Indian dominance in South Asia

 We held exclusive talks with Indian Navy Chief Admiral RK Dhawan in the context of the importance of the International Fleet Review and China's efforts to increase influence in the Indian Ocean

 What is its significance in the Indian context, and why is this happening only for the second time? nausena pramukh : jaisaa aapane kaha, yah puraani parampara he, or kul milakar yah 11waan rivyuu he
 The first review took place in 1953

 beshak, bahut shandaar lagata he, lekin dilachasp baat yah he ki kuch desh yahaan hai, or kuch nahin hai
 Should we be surprised that Pakistan is not here? Comments nausena pramukh : jaisaa maine kaha, yah rivyuu he, jisamen duniyabar se bahut-se deshon kii nausenaayen bhaag le rahi hai
 There are many naval chiefs, 26 presidents of delegations, 24 warships of other navies, and 50 countries are represented

 Industry organization FICCI has suggested that natural resources like iron ore, coal and telecom spectrum should be allocated through auction

 The industry body has said that a transparent and competitive auction process like NELP can be adopted with respect to such natural resources where there is more than one interest in the allocation
 fikki ne kaha he ki anjaan khanij kshetron ke maamle main khuli pravesh niti apanaai ja sakati he
 FICCI said that in order to encourage huge investment in the field of unintentional minerals, mines should be allocated only to those parties who have experience of such work
 haalanki, fikki kaa maananaa he ki nilaamee aadhaarit pranali un maamalon main uchit nahin hogi, jahaan khanij kii uplabdhta, aakaar or grad kii samuchit jaankaree na ho
 The industry association said, in such cases, the speculative bid would get boosted and the risk of overpayment by investors would also arise

 The condition of Delhi's roads is bad
 barish ke baad dilli main sadakon ko sudhaarney or unhen phir se banane kaa kaam hona chahie, lekin dilli vaale gadhdhon main hichkole khaane ke liye majaboor hai
 Even the ring road, called Delhi's lifeline, has reached Badhali, which is also known as Premium Road
 andaaza lagaana mushkil nahin he ki duusari tamaam sadakon kii haalat kya hogi
 The road is in a bad condition near the ashram, a busy intersection on Ring Road
 kai jagah gadhdhon ko dhankane kii koshish kii gai he, lekin is chakkar main puri sadak kharaab ho gai he
 Just after this, the pit starts at the end of flyover of Lajpat Nagar

 The road here is bad and people are upset
 yahi haal dephence colony fly over ke paas kaa he, jahaan gaadiyaan hichkole khate hue chalati hai, kyonki har kuch duuri par sadak tuuti hui he yaa phir oobad khabad ho gai he
 a similar situation is usually in Delhi
 log bataate hai ki har saal monsoon ke baad sadakon kii marammat kaa kaam shuru ho jaataa he, lekin is baar na sirf road kharaab ho rahe hai, balki inaki marammat kaa kabhi koi intazaam abhi tak nahin kiya
 Now also know the reason behind this, money is not coming out of the roads from the treasury of the government
 chah maheene biit gaye, lekin jitna bajet sadakon ke nirmaan or fliover banane ke liye rakhaa gaya tha, uskaa paanchvaan hissaa bhi sarkaar kharch nahin kar pai
 Obviously, when the work is not done, where will the money be spent? bijepi ke dilli ikai ke adhyaksh satish upaadhyaay to kehete hai ki ganimat he ki ye sarkaar 18 fisadi to kharch kar paayi he kyonki inaki jo pryority he use dekhakar to lagata he ki inaki dilli main koi dilchaspee he hi nahin
 Even Delhi's lifeline is Ring Road, its condition is bad
 sadak gaddon se bhari padi he

 ab imran sarkaar kii majaburi he ki vah aatank kaa rasta chode or vaarta ke liye taiyaar ho
 Trump Administration Against Pakistan: The Trump administration of the US on Wednesday praised India for its important anti-terror measures and said that Pakistani terror groups are continuing their attacks in India
 america videsh vibhaag ne apni vaarshik report ‘country report on terarysm’ buudhvaar ko jari kii
 It said that the Indian leadership has pledged to stop the terrorist attacks at the domestic level and to bring the terrorists to justice with the United States and like-minded countries
 report main kaha gaya, ‘bharat lagaataar hamale jhelta rahaa, pakistani aatanki sanghathanon kii ore se or adivasee or maovadiyon kii taraf se bhi
 Indian officials attributed Pakistan's cross-border attacks in Jammu and Kashmir
 ’is report ko bharat kii modi sarkaar ko badi jeet maan sakate hai kyonki isse duniya main pakistan ke khilaaf saaf sandesh dene kii koshish kii gai he
 Such a report has never been released by the American, in which Pakistan was directly responsible for terror
 is report ke baad pakistan ko milane vaale america madad par jarur asar padegaa or pakistanatankwadake vitt poshan vaali niti par gambhirtha se sochega
 US sanctions on Hizbul After the efforts of India, the US declared the Hizbul Mujahideen an international terrorist organization

 On the advice of the Government of India, all the property of Hizbul in America was sealed
 saath hi is samooh ke saath kisi bhi tarah kii lenden par bhi roak laga di gai
 This was a big win for India as this organization is most responsible for the terror in Kashmir
 aatankwaad ke khilaaf antarrashtriya manchon par pakistan ko benakaab karne kii bharat kii koshishon ke liye ise badi kamyaabi mana gaya
 This decision of the US was no less than a major setback for Pakistan engaged in promoting terrorism in Kashmir

 The intelligence agencies of America and India are eyeing each of his antics
 bharat sarkaar ke is kadam se duniya main pakistan kii kalai khuli ki kaise vah masood ajahar jaise dehshatgardon ko paalataa-posta rahaa he
 It was for the first time on 22 September last year under the leadership of the 'terrestan' Modi government in the UN that Pakistan was publicly labeled as 'terristan' in the United Nations (UN)
 itane talkh shabdon main yuan main pehle kabhi pakistan ko latad nahin padi
 In fact, India retaliated in September last year on the lies of Pakistan Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi
 bharat ne kaha ki pakistan aatankiyon kaa garh he or duniya ko maanavadhikaar par pakistan ke gyaan kii jarurat nahin he
 Pakistan has been violating human rights on its own land
 bharat ne yah bhi kaha ki pakistan ko yah samaj lenaa chahie jammu kashmir hamaara abhinn hissaa he
 India's first secretary in the UN, Enam Gambhir, described Pakistan as a 'terrorist' and said that he has been continuously sheltering terrorists
 yah desh aaj puri tarah aatank ko paidaa kar rahaa he
 It is extraordinary that a country that shelters Osama bin Laden and Mullah Omar is pretending to be a victim
 saarc main alag-thalag padaa pakistanyaad kariye thik do saal pehle isi maheene kii ghatana ko
 The matter was about the SAARC conference which was to be held in Pakistan
 islamabad main hone ja rahe saarc sammelan kaa bharat ne is baat par bahishkaar kar diya ki jo desh aatank kaa paryaay bana ho, vahaan sammelan kaa koi auchity nahin
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi had also decided not to attend the conference
 bharat ke is majboot kadam ke peeche uri main aatanki hamale kaa mudda kaaran tha
 The then Foreign Secretary s Jaishankar had issued a second demarche to Pakistani High Commissioner Abdul Basit on the Uri attack on 18 September and gave evidence of 'cross-border terrorists' being involved in the terror attack
 uri main hamale ke baad modi sarkaar jaanati thi ki aar-paar kii sidhi ladaai mumkin nahin he, isliye kuch tarkeeb aisi nikaalani thi jisase pakistan puri duniya main benakaab ho
 India along with four other SAARC member countries decided not to attend the meeting

 General VK Singh said that no such proposal has been received from Pakistan
 videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj ne bhi wike singh kii baat doharaai
 This blunt message from India sent a clear message to Pakistan that foreign affairs will always be settled at the level of the Ministry of External Affairs and not by a personal visit of a leader

 Kabir Singh, a remake of the Telugu film Arjun Reddy, is a story of love and ruin of two lovers
 is film main bollywood actor shahid kapur ne behtareen abhinay kiya he
 Shahid's style, his performance in the role of a stubborn and angry boy and his passion attracts you
 haalanki shahid ke kirdaar kabir se aap pyaar karen yaa usapar dayaa karen, is baat kaa faisla karne main aapako jarur uljhan hogi
 But it is not only Shahid Kapoor in the film who has made us happy with his performance

 kabir ke apni jindagi barbaad karne ke raste par chalane ke baad wo shiva hi he, jo uski madad karata he, uski jaan bachaata he or uske gaayab hone par shahar main use dhundta he
 Overall, Shiva is a friend we do not deserve and Kabir was not worth

 By the way it was the same fabric of Nehru n Gandhi ‘ s India that was torn by your Qaid-e- Azam in 1947 
 Remember ??? - Javed Akhtar (@javedakhtarjadu) August 19, 2019 Javed once again tweeted in his tweet and said that Imran sahab, it would be wrong if i do not praise you for such concern for minorities

 Imraan saheb
 i will be ungrateful if i don’t show my gratitude for your concern about the Indian minorities
 i can't imagine, if you care so much for others how compassionate n protective you must be towards the Hindus, Christians, Ahmadiyas Mohajir n Blochs of your own country— Javed Akhtar (@javedakhtarjadu) August 20, 2019 on Javed Akhtar's tweet Many people have praised him, there were many people who started arguing about the history of India, Pakistan and Kashmir in the comment section

 LB Singh, a teacher in a government school in Saharsa, Bihar, was born in January 1986
 lekin inaki bied kii degree dekhakar aap hairaan rah jaaenge
 He obtained his b
ed degree in 1979, 7 years before his birth
 aisa nahin he ki elbi singh bihar main akele aise teacher hai, jinamein abhimanyu ke gun hon
 There is a lot of such teachers here
 saaran kii indu kumari ne bhi apane janm se 7 saal pehle hi bied kar liya tha
 Shivanarayan Yadav and Preeti Kumari from Madhepura earned a b
ed degree three-three years before birth, while Tarakeswar Prasad of East Champaran qualified for becoming a teacher 5 years before birth
 march-april 2012 main bhartee hue 32,127 kul teachers main se kam se kam 95 aise hai, jinhone janm se pehle hi bied kar lee thi
 In 2010, the Supreme Court ordered that 34,540 people who have done b
ed before the age of 21 years of Bihar government should be admitted as teachers
 supreme court ke faisle ke baad se hi rajya sarkaar ne ye niyuktiyaan kii hai
 In 2003, the SSC removed these recruitments, but the then RJD government did not give appointment
 bihar echaradi ministry ke sutron ne indian express ko bataaya ki bhartee hue 32,127 main se kam se kam 3000 teachers ne farji dastavejon ke aadhaar par naukari hasil kii
 After the investigation started in June 2012 on the complaint of those who were not selected, so far 306 teachers who have been admitted on fake documents have been dismissed
 bihar main pehali kaksha se 8veen tak padhaane ke liye abhyarthi ke paas grajuation ke alaava bied kii degree honi jaruri he
 If any two people have the same degree, then the one who has done b
ed before, is given a job
 bihar main aise prayek regular teacher ko 32 hajaar rupee tankhwaah milti he
 39-39 teachers from Vaishali and Gopalganj in Bihar have been dismissed, while 36 such teachers have lost their jobs from Kaimur

 Mayawati's wealth has increased by 25 per cent in two years

 Mayawati, the head of poor Dalits of UP, owns 111 crores
 yani 56 saal kii mayawati ne apni umr se doguni kamai kii he
 While filing nomination for the Rajya Sabha, Mayawati has declared her total assets, according to which Mayawati has assets worth about 111 crores, including residential and commercial properties, bank cash, gold and diamond jewelery
 2010 main mayawati ne uttar pradesh vidhaan parishad kaa chunaav ladaa tha
 Mayawati's wealth has increased by 25 per cent in two years, according to the figures of that time
 2010 main mayawati kii kul sampatti thi 88 karod, jo ab badhkar 111 karod rupee pahunch gai he
 Whereas Maya's total assets in 2007 were only Rs 52 crore
 yani 5 saal main dogune se zyada ho gai mayawati kii daulat
 The people of UP waited for their progress for 5 years and kept on waiting, but the wealth of Mayawati, the head of the province, definitely increased like the mouth of Sursa

 Yes, a Facebook thug has been killed by the Ghaziabad police
 aaropee fasebuk ke jariye logon ko fansaata tha or ek game ke naam par unase karodon rupee thag letaa tha
 This accused named Raghubir Singh is a millionaire and his swindle trap is spread across the country
 police ke mutabik uski taaja shikaar he devika naam kii ek mahila
 Raghubir cheated Devika, a resident of Gujarat, about Rs 1 crore 10 lakh in his lifetime earnings
 darasal, usne devika ko pehle fasebuk par friendship request bheji
 Gradually, they became friends
 iske baad usne devika ko ek online game khilne ko kaha
 When she won, Urghubir told her that if she gives him about 30 lakh rupees, then she will give him 40 lakh rupees
 iske baad usne devika ko gajiabad bulaayaa or aarope he ki yahaan usne use chaay main milakar nashila padaarth pilaa diya or usase paise thag liye
 Later, he was cheated on more than one crore three times
 lekin jab mahila ko laga ki uskaa paisa waapas nahin hoga to usne police main shikaayat darj karvaa di
 According to the police, Raghubir has cheated many people like this
 usne zyaadaatar mahilaon ko hi apana shikaar banaaya he
 Police arrested Devika on her complaint

 Leader of Opposition in Delhi Legislative Assembly Vijendra Gupta has alleged that CM Arvind Kejriwal has not given up politics on yoga and has boycotted Yoga Day
 vijendra gupta ne aarope lagaaya ki jis yoga diwas ko puri duniya ne manaaya, lekin desh kii itani badi uplabdhi par dilli sarkaar dwaara yoga kaarykram nahin yojit kiya gaya or na hi unhone bharat sarkaar dwaara yojit kisi bhi kaarykram main bhaag liya
 Gupta said that it was sad to learn that the Delhi government completely ignored Yoga Day
 bijepi netaa ne kaha ki is avasar par desh hi nahin balki duniyabar ke karodon logon ne yoga kiya
 But Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and his ministers did not participate in the yoga program
 gupta ne aarope lagaaya ki aam aadmi party ne yoga kaa bhi raajnneetikaran kar diya or aisa karke kejariwal ne sankeern maansikta kaa parichay diya he
 Vijender Gupta said that Kejriwal was also invited to the main event held on Rajpath on International Yoga Day in which thousands of people participated
 lekin dilli ke mukhyamantri or unke mantri yoga diwas ke kaarykram se dur rahe, jabakikejarivalakaryakram ke samay dilli main hi maujuud the
 But neither Kejriwal himself came nor did he send any minister to represent his government
 vijendra gupta ko jab kejariwal kii sehat kaa hawala diya gaya to unhone bolaa ki kejariwal aswasth the to wo apane kisi mantri ko pratinidhi ke rup main bhej sakate the
 But by not doing so, he also did politics on Yoga Day
 aapako bataa den antarrashtriya yoga diwas ke maukey par rajpath par hue kaarykram main mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne hissaa nahin liya tha
 Not only Kejriwal but no one from his cabinet reached

 Let us know that Lt
 Governor Anil Baijal attended the ceremony on Rajpath for more than one and half hour

 Hyderabad Police has arrested three accused for gangrape of a minor girl

 us rose ganga kii god main bahut kam log the
 Two to four boats were passing by nearby
 har naav main tees se pantis log savaar the, jinke chehre kii jhurriyaan bataa rahi thim ki ve usee tabake se aate hai, jinaki mukti kii kaamana main vivekanand 11 sitambar, 1893 kii raat apane kamare main rote rahe, jab dharm sansad main unke bhaashan ne unhen vishwaprasiddh kar diya tha
 Crying Vivekananda had said, "oh mother! What shall i do with name and fame, when my motherland is very poor
" 
 
 koun bharat ke garibon ko uthayega
 
 
 The Who will give them bread 
 
 ? he maa! mujhe rasta dikhaao, main kaise unki sahaayta karun
 
 
 ? " das rupee se zyada kiraaya hota to shaayad ye log dakshineshwar se belur math ke liye naav kii sawari bhi nahin kar pate
 a special kind of simplicity was greeted as soon as it landed at the ghat of Belur Math
 shaayad belur math main pravesh karne kaa yah pichhlaa rasta hoga
 There were two-four tea-samosas and toy carts
 belur math kii taraf mudate hi ek mazaar dikhaa
 Water bottles were being sold and no activity inside
 andar jaakar poochne par pataa chalaa ki chaar sau saal se yah mazaar yahaan maujuud he
 There is a Pir who must have understood India in his own way away from the eyes of the world
 paas main hi vivekanand kii bhi samadhi he
 Do not know, even today, both of them must be talking about the waves of Ganga as witness why people have become greedy about religion
 zyaada poochtacha ke liye upyukt vyakti ke na hone ke kaaran main math ke andar pravesh kar gaya
 The guide standing outside the Swami Ramakrishna temple was telling about Vivekananda in English
 swami ji ne sabhi jagahon or dharmon kii positive baaten lekar is mandir kaa nirmaan kiya he
 Look at the architecture of this temple
 isamen masjid, carch, buddha stupa ke ansh milenge
 Vivekananda visited India to design the temple
 sabhi dharmon kaa saar liya tha
 Apart from the guide's words, i also adored the Nihara temple
 vaaki vaastustyli kaa behtareen namoona he, or shaayad ek prasthaan bindu bhi
 wonderful! mandir ke bagal main vivekanand musium he
 Everyone has kept their clothes and shoes
 jivan se judi kai jhaankiyaan hai
 We all roam around and come out
 kiske man main kya chal rahaa he, koun jaanata he
 There is a peace in the environment, but not an opportunity to think
 belur math paryaton sthal main badal gaya he
 Vivekananda continued to understand the essence of India and religion throughout his life, but people from all over India have come here to understand India, not because of Vivekananda's attraction
 dedh sau saal baad bhi vivekanand main itani dilchaspee sukhad aashcharya ke samaan he
 After the temple and the museum, i enter the literary center in this complex
 dukaan ke bheetar jahaan bhi nazar thaharti he, vahaan vivekanand yaa ramakrishna paramhans ke naam se hi sahitya maujuud he
 Both ideas are categorized and packaged under different names
 mandir kii tarah agar vivekanand ko is sahitya bhandar ko banane kaa mauka miltaa to vah kya karte
 How would Vivekananda react to seeing himself punished in titles like Vedanta, Hinduism, Indianness, Nationality
 unke vichaaron kii samagrata kaa bazaari vargeekaran or sutrikaran dekh acha nahin laga
 Surely Vivekananda would also keep his criticism books in this literature center named after him
 dharm or samskruti par duniyabar kaa or bhi sahitya hota, taaki unke anuyaayi dharm or samskruti ko samgr rup se samajhate, na ki vivekanand ko sirf hindu dharm ke praneta ke rup main jaanakar yahaan se lautate
 How the great man who has collected cultures, architecture from all over the world to build the temple of Belur, would have preferred to keep only his books of thought in this complex or to place strict criticisms on him
 maine jis vivekanand ko padhaa or jitna janaa he, vah aise nahin ho sakate the
 There were some books, which were different from Vivekananda, but most of the books assumed that the style of thinking he pushed was now printed
 unki baaten sirf unke prachaar kaa sahitya ban gai hai
 Literature of inventions of new things was not found
 maine vahaan se kai kitaaben kharidin
 i love reading Vivekananda
 ghar lautakar padhane laga to har kitaab main pichhali kitaab kaa hissaa milane laga
 It is suspected that i am not reading the same book again and again
 unke vichaaron ko yahaan-vahaan thunskar alag-alag naamon se vivekanand sahitya kaa bhandar paidaa kiya ja rahaa he
 Hinduism, Vedanta and Indian lectures, Buddhism and for students
 in naamon kii category se chhapi kitabon main veydant par unka chintan kahin se bich main aa jaataa he
 i see the same in politics
 vivekanand ke naam par log unke chintanon se aage-peeche kii panktiyaan katkar uddhran bana lete hai
 The less Vivekananda's thoughts, the more popular his quotes have become
 vah postaron main kaid kar die gaye hai
 They are cut from references and converted to quotes
 postaron main dhaal diya gaya he
 a monk, who wanted to shake the status quo, has transformed it into the status quo by today's politics
 vivekanand ko formule kii tarah pesh kiya ja rahaa he
 For me, Vivekananda means to courageously raise every question that we leave behind fearing the power of religion
 mere paas vivekanand ke upar bahut-si kitaaben hai
 i am not in a dilemma like the communists nor my blind devotees like the rightists, because Vivekananda has not taught me this
 vah purohitshahi ke virdohi the, brahmanwad par khulkar chot karte the, sanskrit, sahitya or mandiron ko daliton ke liye khol dena chaahate the
 When he made Hindu religion proud, he also said that monopoly of any religion is not right
 ekadhikaar chalaa jaataa he
 Today even those who represent themselves as their representatives in politics cannot attack Brahminism
 kaiyon ko to 'pike' film kii maamuli aalochana tak pasand nahin ai
 Vivekananda means to think openly and say boldly
 kya aaj kii raajnneetik, saamaajik or dharmik vyavastha main yah sambhav he
 The first protesters will do the posters of Vivekananda
 "sabhi satvik or aadhyatmik kavayadon kaa sankshep main yahi sach he ki main pavitra hum or baaki sab apivatra
 
 
 What an animalistic and hellish idea this is
 
 
 " agar vivekanand ke anuyaayi is baat ke marm ko samajhe hote to mandir parisar main prasad lete vakt mujhe nahin jhidakate
 i stood in line to take dry offerings
 meri baari ai to vamahast hone ke kaaran maine baayan haath badha diya
 The person giving the offering looked at him with disgust and without saying closed the eyes and started to remove the left hand
 jaise baayen haath se prasad lene par prasad apavitra ho gaya ho
 i was shocked by this behavior with me
 vivekanand ne to manushyon ke bich jati-dharm kii apavitrataa kii dharna ko pashavik vichaar kaha tha, lekin unke banaae parisar main kaise is vichaar ko jagah mili hui he
 This will happen if we continue to sell Vivekananda by formula
 apavitrataa ke khilaaf vivekanand kii baton ko lekar aaj kitne log varna-vyavastha, jati-vyavastha par prahaar karte hai
 No one works against the varna-system and casteism
 jaat ke naam par ummidavaar chunate hai or bharat ke naam par vot maangate hai
 Do not make Vivekananda the symbol of party or any religion
 unki samalochna ko jagah milani chahie or unke istemaal par bhi sawaal hone chahie
 Vivekananda was against both religious and economic exploitation
 "1928-29 main swami vivekanand ke anuj doctor bhupendranath dutt ne 'vivekanand - da socialist' naamak pustika kaa prakaashan kiya tha
 
 
 In 1927, Bhagat Singh and his comrades were invited to a program of the Naujawan Sabha to address the subject of the condition of revolutionaries in the West
 
 
 is pustar par rudh hinduon ne naak-bhun sikodi, kyonki unke liye vivekanand rahasywaadee vedanti se zyada kuch nahin the
 
 
 "(vivekananda's Janadharma - Kanak Tiwari) vivekanand kaa hindu dharm raajnneetik hindutv nahin tha
 Vivekananda has repeatedly said that i will not use the word Hindu
 ham vaidic athwa vaidantik shabd kaa karenge, jo usase bhi acha he
 'ek Sadvipra Bahudha Vdanti' - Vivekananda has repeated this sutra sentence repeatedly that truth is one, but interpretations are infinite
 kya vivekanand ke vichaaron kii alag-alag vyakhya pesh kii jaati he
 Somewhere we are not afraid of Vivekananda's name or there is no fear
 "yadi har-ek manushya kaa dharmik mat ek ho jaae or har-ek, ek hi maarg kaa avlamban karne lage to sansar ke liye vah bada bura din hoga
 
 
 Then all thoughts of all religions will be destroyed
 
 
 vaibhinya hi jivan kaa mulsutra he
 
 
 " main vivekanand kii is baat se apni baat samaapt karnaa chaahunga
 Translated by famous Hindi poet Suryakant Tripathi Nirala, which has been printed by Nagpur Math as 'swami Vivekananda - Indian Lecture'
 yah vaakya un logon ke liye bhi zaruri he, jo samast rashtriya pahchaan ko ek dharmik pahchaan dena chaahate hai

 Gandhi was also mentioned, but it was said that Gandhi should not be made a veil

 i have kept my personal
 ' kapil ne kaha ki baapu bahut gahari cheez hai, inhen abhi or padhane kii or samajhane kii jarurat he
 It was written by Minister Kapil Mishra that it is not easy to understand the relationship between Mamba and Bapu in the blog
 ba ke bina baapu sambhav hi nahin
 Ba also wrote some letters to Bapu, if you read them, then maybe you start a different understanding of love and love
 aapchaanakkisi baat ko sidhe baapu se jod dena, unke jivan ke kisi ek paksh se jod dena aasaan jarur he par sahi nahin
 To understand Bapu, many lives are needed to learn from the life of souls like those glasses, sticks, dhotis
 ba jaisaa samarpan va prem
 All this is to think, meditate with calm mind
 abhi kuch din pehle main sabarmati ashram gaya tha, baapu ke jivan ke bare main likhaa he vahaan, unki baaten, unke lekh, unke satyagrah, jivan main, apane andar satya ke liye aagrah
 a sense of non-violence inside oneself
 baapu sirf angrejo se thodi aazaadee dilaane aae the, wo jis swaraj, satya va ahimsa kii baat karte the
 It was so difficult to adopt that we left Bapu
 jinhone baapu ko maaraa wo kis baat se darate the ? kya takat thi us buudhe main ki godse jaise ko laga ki khatam hi karnaa padegaa ?baapu se seekhney kii zaruratek mutthi namak se duniya ke baadshahon ko hilaane ke liye jo naitik, aadhyatmik, saamaajik shakti va sweekruti baapu ke paas thi wo nakli hon hi nahin sakati
 Compare Bapu's life when there are scales that can be measured, weighed
 baapu ne to ek bachche ko zyada gud mat khao ye kehane main bhi das din laga die, kyonki pehle khud zyada gud khaane kii aadat par sanyam kiya phir sikh di
 To hail yourself before victory over others
 baapu to kunjee he, chaabi he, duvidha dur karne ke liye he
 Bapu is not a curtain
 dhankane or chhipaane ke liye baapu nahin he
 May God bless you, God bless you all

 # mykindalove # wedidgoodhoney # tothebestandrestofourlivesa photo posted by Genelia Deshmukh (@geneliad) onfeb 2, 2017 at 2:51 pm PST bharat ne westeindies ko haraa diya
 Defeating by a margin of 318 runs is a big deal
 par yah aisi khabar he jise aapane subah se pard-sun liya hoga
 But the real news is India's Yorkman Jasprit Bumrah
 buumrah ne mahaj 7 ran kharch karke 5 wicket uda liye
 In the first innings, even though Ishant Sharma was jovial, Boomrah raised India's hand in the second innings
 inaki tufaani gendbaaji ke dam par hi pehle test match ke chauthe hi din bharat ne westeindies ko dher kar diya
 With this, Team India took a 1-0 lead in the two-match Test series and scored 60 points in their first World Test Championship match
 kam ran dekar zyada se zyada wicket lenaa kisi bhi gendbaaj kaa sapana hota he
 Exploring Antigua was not a first-time issue for Jasprit Bumrah
 bumraah sabase kam ran dekar test kii ek pari main 5 yaa isse zyada wicket lene vaale bhartiya gendbaaj ban gaye
 Prior to Bumrah, this record was in the name of Venkatapathi Raju, who took 6 wickets for 12 runs against Sri Lanka in Chandigarh in 1990
 test match kii ek pari main jasprit buumrah ne aisa karnama chauthi baar kiya he jab unhone paanch yaa isse zyada wicket hasil kiye hai
 He has achieved this feat in four different rounds
 unhone dakshin africa, england, australia or ab westeindies daure par yah uplabdhi hasil kii
 Bumrah has become the first bowler not only of India but of Asia who has taken five wickets in every tour of these four countries
 jaraa buumrah kii gendbaaji dekhie, baguule kii tarah udaan bharte or ran ap lete samay unki dehbhasha dekhie
 Unlike any fast bowler, his run up is short but speed is not low
 or jitani teji he usase bhi adhik sateek gende daalate hai
 Especially the yorker
 abhi bharat kii gendbaaji main dhar ai he
 Although Mohammed Shami bowls in a traditional way, he keeps batting at one end
 jaahir he, uske baad buumrah apni neze jaisi tikhi gendon se ballebaaj ko pavilion bhejne par utaaru rahete hai
 Ishant's swing and Jadeja's spin hold runs in their own way
 ek dfa paanch wicket le lenaa shaayad utani badi baat nahin, par captain agar mushkil ghadi main barambar buumrah ko hi gend pakadaae to maidan main unki bhoomika kii ahmiyat saaf ho jaati he
 The belief in Bumrah is also because he does not just deal with speed
 genden sateek bhi daalate hai or hawa main use ghumaate bhi hai
 Normally, his ball also turns into a fork after eating
 wicket bhartiya paristhitiyon kaa ho yaa phir videshi sarajameen par baari mausam vaala, buumrah ne laal or safed donon gendon ko apane man mutabik speed or ghumaav diya he
 But Bumrah has been mesmerized by his bowling in all three formats of cricket
 aade vaale dinon main bhartiya cricket un par apni nigaah banaae rakhega balki aankh mundakar bharosa bhi karata rahegaa
 (manjeet Thakur is Special Correspondent in India Today) *** ramajanm bhoomi-babari masjid swaamitv vivaad par supreme court main maamla chal rahaa he, duusari taraf ise aapasi rajamandi se sulajhaaye jane kii lagaataar koshishen bhi kii ja rahi hai jo kaamyaab hoti nahin dikh rahi
 Meanwhile, Sri Sri Ravi Shankar says that it is not possible to find a solution from the court on this issue
 art of living ke pramukh shri shri ravishankar ne ramajanm bhoomi-babari masjid vivaad par kaha ki court is samasya main koi antim samaadhaan nahin nikaal saktaa
 In Balrampur, Uttar Pradesh, Ravi Shankar said, 'the court will not solve the Ramjanmabhoomi problem
 'unhone aage kaha, 'agar court se faisla hoga to kisi ek paksh ko haar sweekaar kerani padegi
 In such a situation, the loser will still accept, but after some time, a ruckus will start again
 jo samaaj ke liye acha nahin hoga
 He hoped that a amicable solution would be found in this case outside the court
 aapasi rajamandi ke saath samjhaute kaa virodh karne waalon ke bare main bolte hue shrishri ravishankar ne kaha ki agyanta kaa pradarshan karne kaa sabhi ko adhikaar he or vah is bare main kuch nahin kah sakate
 Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, the founder of the Sri Sri Art of Living (AOL), who is trying to compromise, is constantly trying on the Babri masjid-ram Janmabhoomi dispute to settle the dispute with mutual consent rather than court
 is silsile main unhone isi maheene ol india muslim personal lau board (empielbi) or sunni vakf board ke sadasyon sahit muslim netaaon ke saath ek baithak kii thi
 The Ayodhya dispute was heard in the Supreme Court on 8 February
 court ne sabhi pakshon ko do hafte ke andar maamle se jude kagajaat laane ko kaha tha
 The next hearing of the case will be on 14 March
 supreme court ne safataur par nirdesh diya ki vah is maamle kii sunwaayee ek jamini vivaad ke taur par hi karenge, kisi bhi dharmik bhaavana or raajnneetik dabaav main sunwaayee ko nahin suna jayega
 Union ministers Ashwini Choubey and Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti have praised the efforts of Sri Sri Ravi Shankar for the temple agreement
 unka kahana he ki agar koi shanti se mudde ko sulajhane kii koshish kar rahaa he, to uski tarif honi chahie
 After meeting Nadavi in lucknow, xxwrep 4 Sri Ravi Shankar has left for Shravasti after Balrampur
 shaam ko vah lakhanu me rahenge
 Where he will meet Maulana Salman Nadvi, to discuss his future plans
 salmaan nadvi ek human welfare board kaa gathan karne vaale hai or is sambandh main bhi charchaa hone kii sambhaavna he

 The board, formed at the initiative of Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, will be called 'human Welfare Board'
