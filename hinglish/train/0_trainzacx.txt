 ' At the meeting of Delhi University SC, ST, OBC Teachers Forum, the teachers defended the new education policy - the government is conspiring to deprive them of higher education through this policy, said the government's teachers union will not vote in Dutta University a meeting of the SC-ST-OBC Teachers Forum was held on Thursday regarding the Teachers Association (DUTA) election
 baithak main is baat par charchaa kii gai ki nai shiksha niti kaa dalit, pichde virgon ke abhyarthiyon par kya prabhaav padegaa
 The meeting took place at du's North Campus
 baithak kii adhyakshata forum ke nav nirvaachit adhyaksh pro
 Kailash Prakash Singh Yadav did it
 baithak main vibhinn collejon ke shikshakon ne hissaa liya tha
 Here, along with the new education policy, the candidates of the government's teachers' union, who have been nominated for the DUTA elections, will not vote
 yahaan bhi tay kiya gaya ki jald hi forum sarkaar kii nai shiksha niti ke virodh main sadakon par utrega
 In the meeting, teachers discussed various policy rules under the new education policy
 isamen shikshakon ne nai shiksha niti par sarkaar kii kadi aalochana karte hue ise dalit, pichde shikshakon ke virodh main bataaya
 These teachers said that the new education policy prevents the reserved category candidates from entering higher education
 nai shiksha niti par apane vichaar rakhte hue dilli vishvavidhyalay kii vidwat parishad ke purv sadsy pro
 Hansraj 'suman' said that 1 year probation tenure was put in place after the first permanent appointment process in universities / colleges
 ab nai shiksha niti ke tahat ise 5 varsh kaa kar diya gaya he, yah shikshak virdohi niti kaa ek udhaaharan he
 There will be full scope for the intervention of the Principal and Vice Chancellor of the institution, who should give permanent appointment after the probation period or keep it for 5 years in the probation period
 pro
 Suman has said that not only this, the rules ahead of it are even more dangerous
 iske tahat har paanch saal ke baad shikshakon ke assesament kii prakriya banaai gai he jisamen principal ke paas shikshak kii padonnati kaa ekadhikaar hoga
 This will increase the chances of arbitrariness
 abhi tak vishvavidhyalay / college kii sthiti ye he ki wo apane shikshan kaary ke liye sthaayee niyukti ke baad purnatah swatantra hota he
 Now in the new education policy, he will work under pressure from the principal, which is against the nature of higher education
 isamen dalit va pichde varg ke shikshak bhedbhaav ke kaaran hameshaa principal ke nishane par rahenge
 He expressed concern that in this way the government wants to end its nature by tying up the permanent appointment process in 5-5 years assessment
 isse shikshak gulam kii tarah ho jayega jahaan shikshan kaary puri tarah prabhavit hoga
 In the meeting, Dr
 vinay kumaar ne kaha ki is policy ke baad ucch shiksha khaas virgo ke liye rah jaaegi kyonki jis tarah se sarkaar shiksha kaa privetigeshan kar rahi he usase lagata he ki ucch shiksha dalit, adivasee or pichde virgon ke liye ek sapana banakar rah jaaegi
 He has called upon the younger generation not to let the government's new anti-higher education policy be implemented
 wo iskaa datakar muqabla karen varanaa bhavishya main ucch shiksha main arakshit varg nahin aa paaegaa
 Speaking in his presidential speech on the new education policy, Prof
 kailash prakaash singh yadav ne kaha ki nai shiksha niti se niyukti prakriya par asar padegaa kyonki 5 saal ke assesment ko jab shikshakon ke pramotion baadhit honge to bahut se yogya abhyarthi jo shiksha ke kshetra main aana chaahate hai ab ve anya sansthaanon ko apni sevaayen denge
 Apart from this, if qualified teachers will be called in private sector universities at a higher salary than government institutions, then it is natural that the quality of government institutions will also be questioned
 sanstha se niyukti lekar pramotion tak ke adhikaar main shikshak ke moolyankan kii prakriya ko de dene se sarkari kshetra ke shikshakon main bhay kaa vaataavaran bana rahegaa
 In the new education policy, the format of evaluation has also been given to the student
 swaabhaavik he ki koi bhi shikshak padhaane se adhik chaatro ko aantarik moolyankan main evam kaksha main upasthiti main sahuuliyat dekar apane moolyankan ke prati lenden kii sthiti paidaa karegaa, jo ki student ke liye zyada khatarnaak sthiti paidaa karegaa
 At the end of the meeting, all the teachers decided to strongly oppose the new education policy coming soon by the government

 "it can be deduced that without stepping on Mars, India wants to answer this big question, are we alone in this universe?" a state-of-the-art camera will also take colorful images of Mars, while another experiment will try to find out how the sparse atmosphere (thin atmosphere) on Mars keeps changing
 yah is baat ko samajhane ke liye bhi jaruri he ki kya kabhi mangal par insaani bastiyaan basaai ja sakati hai
 There is a surprising coincidence with the planets that the recently discovered Tailed Spring named Siding Spring is going to pass close to Mars in 2014 and it is highly likely that Mangalyaan will pass through the rear of this Tailed Star, making it perfect There will be a rare chance to be in the right place on time

 The third candidate to reach Mars is also in the fray
 1998 main japan kaa nojomi mars satellite asafal rahaa tha
 By the way, China has defeated India in almost every aspect of the space mission; He sent the first manned mission in 2003; Even his lunar mission was done before India, yet the journey to Mars will probably give India an edge

 On the one hand, the Narendra Modi government at the Center is preparing to redeem it in the elections by giving constitutional status to the Other Backward Commission (OBC), while on the other hand the BJP in Uttar Pradesh has quietly engaged in backward castes one by one
 mahagathbandhan ke teji se ubhaar ko dekhte hue keshav prasad maury ko yah jimmedaari di gai he ki vah uttar pradesh main tamampichhadi jatiyonka jativaar sammelan karen or ek-ek kar unhen bijepi ke kaaryakramon se joden
 After this decree of party president Amit Shah, the BJP is engaged in holding caste-wise meetings
 pichley 2 dinon main lakhanu main bijepi ne prajapati yani kumhaar, nai or rajbhar jaise ati pichhadi jatiyon kaa sammelan kiya he or agle kuch dinon main duusari jatiyon kaa bhi sammelan bulaane ja rahi he
 At all the conferences, Keshav Maurya and Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath put the policies and programs of the Modi government in front of them, but by gathering caste, the party wanted to give the message that everything is on one side and caste mobilization on the other
 prajapati yani kumhaaron ke sammelan main yogi adityanath ne ek ore to maati kala kii baat kii, vahiin jati ke naam par sapa or basapa ko bhi jamkar kosa
 Chief Minister Adityanath had said that previous governments committed naked orgy, backward classes and Dalits were deprived in the name of backwardness
 survey main pataa chalaa ki aazaadee ke baad bhi kai jatiyon ko vikaas yojana kaa laabh nahin mila
 We did development work along with the overall village plan
 yogi adityanath ne jahaan pichhadon ke liye kiye apane kaam ko ginaya vahiin keshav prasad maury ne ek baar phir pichhadi jatiyon ke sammelan main pradhanmantri modi kii jati kii yaad dilaai
 Maurya also referred to his caste in these conferences of the castes, describing Prime Minister Modi as the most powerful and big leader of the country and said that when the Prime Minister of the country is of backward caste, these castes should no longer be seen elsewhere
 jatiyon ke in sammelnon ke baad keshav maury ne aaj tak se khaas baatcheet kii or pichhadi jatiyon ke liye ho rahe in sammelnon ke bare main bataaya
 After this, the BJP is also holding meetings of other castes including Gurjars, Jats, Saini, Shakya, Mallah, Nishad and they will also be fed with the ideology of BJP
 ab dekhnaa yah he jatigat sanghathan main maahir keshav prasad maury 2019 main mahagathbandhan ke saamne kis tarah pichhadi jatiyon ke is mahagathbandhan ko khadaa kar pate hai

 himalay kii god main sthit diardio kii prayogshaala na sirf bhartiya fouj ke liye sanjivani kii khoj kar rahaa he balki vahaan ajoobe bhi dekhne ko mil rahe hai

 leh sthit dephence institute of hai altitude research pradhanmantri narendra modi ke jai jawan or jai kisaan ke naare ko ek kadam aage badhaane main mahatvapurn bhoomika adaa kar rahaa he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his address to the nation had mentioned the same organic laboratory in Ladakh
 dilachasp baat yah he ki is green prayogshaala main ab tak diardio ne gobhi or kaddu jaise organic 'bam' taiyaar kiye hai
 Actually, weapons are not made in this laboratory, but the soldiers guarding the borders on the outskirts get better doses, for this, scientists in this laboratory devise the best yields with modern technology
 diardio kii harith kranti prayogshaala main phool gobhi, patta gobhi or duusari aisi kai subjiyan ugaai ja rahi hai jinke peeche aadhunik takanic sainikon kii jarurat or ladakh ke kisaanon kii behatar aay kaa lakshya rakhaa gaya
 DRDO scientists have conducted technical investigations for nutritious yields of spinach and tomatoes without the help of logistic as well as better doses for soldiers in difficult conditions at an altitude of thousands of feet, strangling bones like Siachen
 leh sthit dephence institute of hai altitude research yani diiechaear ke nideshak opi chaurasia ne bataaya ki is prayogshaala main bina mitti ke kam jagah main kheti kisi ho or hari subjiyan kaise uge, uske liye hamane is takanic ko viksit kiya he
 Chaurasia says that the crop gets ready in 30 days under this technique even in inaccessible conditions
 yahaan ek se badhkar ek fasalon par research kii ja rahi he
 a vegetable called Zucchini which is commonly found in Western countries, the size and brightness of the Zucchini grown in this laboratory of Ladakh is much better than that found in the market
 itnaa hi nahin diardio kii is prayogshaala main kaddu to haroonges he
 Pumpkins grown here can weigh from 40 to 50 kg
 vaigyanik doctor dorji aanchuk ne aaj tak ko bataaya ki leh jaise safed registan main jahaan sardiyon main taapmaana mines 25 ke neeche chalaa jaataa he, vahaan aisi subjiyan ugaana apane aap main chunauti he
 Watermelon bombs were also seen in this laboratory
 hairat vaali baat isliye he kyonki ladakh safed registan ke naam se janaa jaataa he, jahaan saal bhar mausam thanda hota he or tarbooz saamanytah nadiyon ke kinare paaya jaataa he
 Scientist Dr
 Sering says that the technique here is provided to those farmers, where farmers in the plains earn one and a half lakh rupees in one hectare while in Ladakh, they can earn 10 to 12 lakh rupees from this crop
 bataa den ki isi prayogshaala main ab solo naamak paudhe ko taraasha jayega or usase jadi booti banaai jaaegi
 PM Modi had told about this plant in his address
 is paudhe ko ladakhi bhashaa main sonu kaha jaataa he or iskaa vaigyanik naam radiola haiske bare main diardio kii prayogshaala ke nideshak doctor opi chaurasia ne bataaya ki isamen shaareerik kshamta ko badhaane vaali hai altitude sickness se nipatane vaali radiation or cancer se ladane samet har bimariyon se ladane kii kshamta he
 If our soldiers sitting in the mountains like Siachen can get medicines made from it, then their capacity will increase many times more

 inase bachane main unka saath dete hai, saf ali khan
 'go Goa Gone' is a comedy where Kunal's one liners laugh
 anand tiwari, jo bani ke kirdaar main hai, unka bhi jabardast abhinay he
 Virdas's work is fine, while Pooja and Saif do not have much to do
 tippaniyan The film laughs, but lacks a good story
 kahani kaa anumaan darshak pehle se hi laga sakate hai isliye kahani itnaa majaa nahin de paati
 Many times the screen play progresses, but then comes back, due to which the story slows down and starts to get boring
 film ke gane achche hai, jaise baba ji kii booti
 
 
 
 hindustani darshakon ke liye jombij ko samajhnaa jaraa mushkil he, par film main koshish kii gai he, jombi kaa matlab samajhane kii
 If you understand zombie and watch the film without applying logic, then maybe this story sets you up
 is film ke liye reating he, 2
 5 stars aapane bahut-si hollywood film dekhi hongi, jahaan mukhya kirdaar jombij ke bich funs jate hai or phir shuru hota he unase bachane kaa silsilaa

 The people in the rave party take a drug that makes them zombies
 ye tino dost apni garlfriend ke saath in jombij ke bich funs jate hai
 Saif Ali Khan supports them to avoid them
 'go goa gon' ek kamedi film he, jahaan kunal ke van liners hansaate hai
 Anand Tiwari, who plays Bani, also has a tremendous acting
 virdaas kaa kaam thik he, vahiin puja or saf ke paas zyada kuch karne ko nahin dikhataa
 The comments film hansaati he, par ek acchhee kahani kii kami khalati he
 The audience can guess the story well in advance, so the story does not give so much fun
 kai baar lagata he screen play aage badhata he, par phir waapas aa jaataa he, jisaki vajah se kahani dhimi pad jaati he or ubaau lagane lagati he
 The songs of the film are good, like Baba Ji Ki Booti
 
 
 
 It is difficult for the Indian audience to understand zombies, but the film tries to explain the meaning of zombies
 agar jombi aap samajhate hai or bina logic lagaae film dekhte hai to shaayad yah kahani aapako jam jaae
 The rating for this film is 2
 5 stars

 Virdas's work is fine, while Pooja and Saif do not have much to do
 tippaniyan The film laughs, but lacks a good story
 kahani kaa anumaan darshak pehle se hi laga sakate hai isliye kahani itnaa majaa nahin de paati
 Many times the screen play progresses, but then comes back, due to which the story slows down and starts to get boring
 film ke gane achche hai, jaise baba ji kii booti
 
 
 
 hindustani darshakon ke liye jombij ko samajhnaa jaraa mushkil he, par film main koshish kii gai he, jombi kaa matlab samajhane kii
 If you understand zombie and watch the film without applying logic, then maybe this story sets you up
 is film ke liye reating he, 2
 5 stars film hansaati he, par ek acchhee kahani kii kami khalati he
 The audience can guess the story well in advance, so the story does not give so much fun
 kai baar lagata he screen play aage badhata he, par phir waapas aa jaataa he, jisaki vajah se kahani dhimi pad jaati he or ubaau lagane lagati he
 The songs of the film are good, like Baba Ji Ki Booti
 
 
 
 It is difficult for the Indian audience to understand zombies, but the film tries to explain the meaning of zombies
 agar jombi aap samajhate hai or bina logic lagaae film dekhte hai to shaayad yah kahani aapako jam jaae
 The rating for this film is 2
 5 stars

 ravivaar ko enditivi se khaas baatcheet main dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne elaan kar diya ki agar unka sapana janalokapal or swaraj bill paas nahin hua to vah istifa de denge
 There was a political stir in Delhi and on Monday there remained a topic of discussion in Delhi whether Kejriwal's government was going? aam aadmi party ko pehle din se cover kar rahaa hoon isliye kuch baaten saamne rakh rahaa hoon
 The Aam Aadmi Party government was not formed in Delhi
 congress ne bina maange samarthan isliye diya tha ki dobaaraa chunaav ho jate to congress dilli main shaayad aath siten bhi na jeet paati or vaise bhi congress ko bijepi ke muqaabale aam aadmi party zyaada bhaati he, isliye congress ne sarkaar banavaayi
 BJP also wanted that AAP government should be formed, so that one can tell the difference between Kejriwal's words and actions and second, the damage done by the Aam Aadmi Party in BJP should not be done in the Lok Sabha or stop the chariot of Modi
 yani dilli main aam aadmi party kii sarkaar jisane banavaayi, sarkaar chalavane kii zimmedaari uski he
 Arvind Kejriwal is well aware of this, so he threatened to play these bets
 haalanki congress or bijepi donon hi kah rahi he ki ham lokapal ke nahin lokapal laane ke tareeke ke khilaaf hai
 The Congress will let the government fall in the same condition when it feels that the loss of BJP will be more if Kejriwal is freed from Delhi
 lekin, us surat main bijepi ko samarthan karnaa pad jayega or vaise bhi vah aisa karke bhrashtachar ke kilaaf hai moral ground le sakati he

 diwali par dilli main pradooshan ko lekar kai upaay kiye ja rahe hai lekin sabhi upayon ko purvi dilli kii gajipur landphil site munh chidhaa rahi he
 Even before the pollution caused by firecrackers, the people of East Delhi are forced to breathe in the poisonous air as the Ghazipur landfill site is still on fire in many places and dangerous smoke is spreading all over the area
 aaj tak kii team ne buudhvaar ko jabgajipur landphil sitaka daura kiya to paaya ki jis jagah par haadasa hua tha vahaan or jis jagah par haadase ke baad kooda daalana dobaaraa shuru kiya gaya vahaan aag lagane se kaaphi zyaada dhuaan ho rahaa he, kooday kaa pahaad dhuen ke agosh main he
 When the MCD was asked about this, the officials responded
 nagam adhikariyon ke mutabik ye prakritik kaarnon se hota he kyonki landphil site par methane gas banati he or usamen jaldi aag bhi lag jaati he
 Many times a gas is ignited due to hot weather or even a small spark

 soshal media par ek viral video ke jariye daawa kiya gaya he ki kendriya mantri smriti irani ne maa durga ke liye aapattijanak shabd kahe hai
 The video is of a TV news channel, in which Smriti Irani is seen making speeches in English in Parliament
 bhaashan main smriti ko angreji main kehete suna ja saktaa he- 'durga puja sabase zyada vivaadaaspad or naslvaadi tyohaar he, jahaan pratimaa main khubasurat durga maa ko kaale rang ke sthaneey nivasee mahisasur ko maarthe dikhaaya jaataa he
 Mahishasura was a brave, self-respecting leader who was implicated by the Aryans for marriage
 unhone ek sex varkar kaa sahaara liya jiskaa naam durga tha
 Durga lured Mahishasura to the wedding and murdered her after celebrating a honeymoon for 9 days
 ' video se saaf he ki wo sansad main bol rahi hai
 India Today's anti-fake News War Room (AFWA) found the viral post to be misleading
 is video ko kaat chhaant kar taiyaar kiya gaya he jisase iskaa puraa arth hi badal gaya he
 Actually, Smriti Irani read a statement of some students of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) in Delhi
 Raman Kumar naam ke fasebuk yujar sahit kai logon ne is bhraamak video ko share kiya he
 Thousands of people have shared this post so far
 utyub par bhi ye video khub dekha ja rahaa he
 The video was uploaded on an youtube channel called Anoop Bhankhar on 14 September 2019, which has seen more than one lakh people so far
 padtaal main pataa chalaa ki ye video 24 farvari 2016 kaa he jab smriti irani ne kendriya maanav sansaadhan mantri ke taur par is maamle main sansad main jawaab diya tha
 In this speech Smriti said that Mahishasura Martyrdom Day is celebrated in JNU
 smriti kaa kahana tha ki oktober 2014 main is diwas ke aayojan ke vakt college ke kuch dalit-adivasee, obisi or alpsankhyak chaatro ne ek bayaan jari kiya tha
 Abusive words were used for Maa Durga in this statement
 puure bayaan ko smriti irani ne sansad main padhaa tha or isaki kadi aalochana kii thi
 We also got a youtube video of this speech by Smriti Irani
 agar is video ko 30:41 minute ke baad se dekha jaae to saafe samaj aata he ki smriti JNU ke chaatro kaa bayaan padhakar suna rahi thim
 In order to create confusion, the part of the video has been cut where Smriti is referring to the students of JNU
 kya he JNU deshadroh kaa maamla?farvari, 2016 main JNU kaa ek maamla saamne aayaa tha jisamen uniwarsity ke kuch chaatro par deshvirohi naare lagaae jane kaa aarope laga tha
 There was a lot of ruckus between the government and university students in this matter
 isi bavaal ko lekar smriti irani ne sansad main bhaashan diya tha
 The investigation revealed that the video of Smriti Irani's speech has been tampered with to create confusion

 Some people consider Mahishasuraka not as a mythological but a historical character and consider him their ancestor (jananayak)
 mahisasur kaa sambandh pracheenjanajati asurase bhi joda jaataa he, desh main jinaki aabaadi kareeb 9,000 bachi he
 Anil Asura, a social worker from Gumla, Jharkhand, says, 'I have read in school books that the gods killed the asuras
 lekin asal main vah hamaare pratapi purvajon kii samuhik hatyaein thim
 'people organized by organizing a public meeting had celebrated the mourning event, that after Mahishasura was killed by Durga and his allied gods, Ashwin Purnima was mourned by the followers of Mahishasura by organizing a large public meeting and resolved to recover the lost glory
 Had taken
 isi vajah se adhiktar aayojan asina poornima yani dashahra kii dasvin ke thik paanch din baad manaate hai
 Sometimes it is called 'mahishasura Martyrdom Day' and sometimes 'mahishasura Remembrance Day'
 ’purvajon ko karte hai smaranmahishasur aayojan se jude or forward press patrika ke salaahkaar sampadak pramod ranjan bataate hai, 'darasal, yah aayojan koi puja yaa karmkand nahin he balki ham is din mahisasur or apane purvajon ko samaran karte hai or bahujanon se sambandhit bauddhik vimarsh yaa baatcheet karte hai
 This is its real strength and this is why it has become popular among Bahujans and is celebrated in many parts of the country
 'upi or bihar main bhi manaate hai yah diwasavarsh 2014 main jeenyu main iske aayojan kaa virodh karte hue abivipi ne kaarykram main baadha pahunchaai thi or maamla bhi darj karaayaa tha
 Mahishasur Martyrdom Day could not be held in JNU in October 2015 due to these pressures and aibsf's main organizers having completed research from JNU, but the organizers claim that Deoria of UP, Muzaffarpur in Bihar, Bhagalpur, West It was celebrated in more than 300 places across the country, including Kolkata and Purulia in Bengal

 The price of fire of tomatoes in the capital of the country is now beginning to affect onion too
 dilli kii gajipur mandi main pyaaj ke daam main behtasha badhat dekhne mil rahi he
 The team of 'aaj Tak' interacted with traders selling vegetables in bulk in Ghazipur mandi and visited the retail market in some areas of East Delhi, where the public is shocked by the increased prices of tomatoes as well as onions
 sabase pehlepyajke thok bhav par nazar daalate hai
 Till last week, the price of onions sold in Ghazipur mandi at Rs 20 per kg has reached Rs 25 to Rs 27 per kg on August 5
 mahangaai kii maar jhel rahi aam janata ab mandi kaa rukh karne lagi he
 The bad condition is for those who are buying onion in the local market up to Rs 40 per kg
 gajipur mandi sabji kharidne aae veda prakaash ne bataaya ki bade hue daamon se pareshaan hokar aaj unhone paanch kilo pyaaj kharida he
 He says that he could not see any difference between the retail price of tomatoes and the retail prices of the local market inside the market
 vahiin, mandi main subjiyan kharid rahe deepak ne bataaya ki pyaaj or tamaato kii mahangaai ne thali kaa swaad puri tarah bigaad diya he
 There has been no decrease in the price of tomatoes for the last one month
 alam yah he ki gajipur mandi main bhi tamaato kaa footkar daam 65 se 70 rupee kilo he
 According to traders, currently Shimla and Bangalore tomatoes are selling more in Delhi
 haalanki mandi main tamaato kaa thok kaa bhav 50 rupee ke aasapaas he, jisaki dilli ke alag-alag ilaakon main footkar bikri 80 rupee prati kilo tak ho rahi he
 Distressed by the expensive onions and tomatoes of East Delhi's Geeta Colony, Kulwinder often comes to buy vegetables at Gazipura and Mandi
 kulwinder ne bataaya ki ek maheene se mahangaa tamaato khareednaa pad rahaa he, jiske chalate unka bajet bighad gaya he or tyohaar manaanaa bhi mushkil ho rahaa he
 After Ghazipur mandi, the team of 'aajtak' visited Laxmi Nagar area, it was very surprising to hear the price of onion and tomato
 pyaaj 40 rupee prati kilo to tamaato 80 rupee prati kilo tak bik rahaa tha
 Neelam Sharma, who lives in Laxmi Nagar, says that due to expensive tomatoes, her month-long budget has been reduced to a week-long budget
 unka kahana he ki thali main swaad banaae rakhane ke liye wo pyaaj or tamaato khareednaa band nahin kar sakati hai, lekin ab 3 tamaato kii jagah dedh tamaato se kaam chalaanaa pad rahaa he
 Neelam has also appealed to the government to take necessary steps
 philhal gajipur mandi main vyapaariyon ke mutabik fasal kharaab hone kii vajah se agast ke maheene main pyaaj or tamaato mahange rah sakate hai
 The Nitish Kumar cabinet in Bihar on Wednesday approved a proposal to amend the Government Servant Ethics Rules, 1976
 iske tahat sarkari karmchaaree ko sarvice rule ke tahat sharaab pine par bain laga diya gaya he
 This amendment has been made in the service rules of government employees with the intention of enforcing liquor restrictions and force in Bihar
 cabinet main paas hue prastaav ke mutabik sarkari karmchaaree yaa phir nyaayik seva ke adhikari ke sharaab pine par puri tareeke se roak laga di gai he
 While briefing journalists about this amendment, Cabinet Secretary Brijesh Malhotra said that under the 1976 Service Rule, government employees were prohibited from drinking alcohol or use of drugs only at work, otherwise it would elsewhere Could consume alcohol or drugs
 lekin ab sanshodhit prastaav ke baad sarkari karmchaaree yaa phir nyaayik seva kaa adhikari kahin bhi sharaab or maadak padaarth ke istemaal karne par bain laga diya gaya he

 Since Monday, Justice AR Joshi is writing his verdict in open court
 tippaniyan The court is writing the verdict, taking into consideration every screw, along with the decision of the Sessions Court, and the arguments of the prosecution and the defense
 
 
 masalan, salmaan khan rain baar main gaye the, yah to sabit hota he, lekin salmaan ko us raat kisi ne bhi sharaab pite hue nahin dekha tha
 Apart from this, there is also confusion over the date of the hotel bill, as the police introduced the bill on 27 September, but the date had changed when Salman left from there
 vaise, salmaan khan khud gaadi chalaa rahe the, is par bhi bhram barkaraar he, kyonki kisi ne salmaan khan ko gaadi chalaate nahin dekha tha
 There are other nuances, which are probably being taken into consideration
 jaise - gavaah number 8 ne kaha tha ki car main chaar log the, or iske baad abhiyojan paksh ne use cross ekzamin nahin kiya, jo hona chahie tha
 For example, the FIR registered after the incident, Salman Khan was not written about drinking alcohol, and that charge was added a few days later
 jaise - gavaah number 7 ne cross ekzamination ke dauraan kaha tha ki us samay salmaan khan ke munh se sharaab kii bu nahin aa rahi thi, or vah ladkadaa bhi nahin rahe the
 For example, Salman Khan's consent was required before taking a blood sample to check whether he had drunk alcohol that night, but Salman's signature was not found on the form
 satr nyaayalay ke faisle, tathaa abhiyojan paksh or bachaav paksh kii daleelon par gaur karne ke saath-saath har pench par dhyaan dete hue adaalat faisla likh rahi he
 
 
 For example, Salman Khan went to the Rain Bar, this proves, but no one had seen Salman drinking alcohol that night
 iske alaava, hotel ke bill kii taarikh ko lekar bhi uljhan he, kyonki police ne 27 sitambar kaa bill pesh kiya, lekin salmaan jab vahaan se nikle, tab taarikh badal chuki thi
 By the way, the confusion over Salman Khan himself was driving, because no one had seen Salman Khan driving
 kuch or bhi nukte hai, jinhen sambhawatah dhyaan main rakhaa ja rahaa he
 Eg - witness number 8 stated that there were four people in the car, and after that the prosecution did not cross-examine him, which should have happened
 jaise - haadase ke baad darj exiaar salmaan khan ke sharaab pie hone kii baat nahin likhi gai thi, or vah aarope kuch din baad joda gaya
 Like - witness number 7 said during cross examination that at that time Salman Khan's mouth was not smelling of alcohol, and he was not stumbling
 jaise - salmaan khan ne us raat sharaab pi thi yaa nahin, isaki jaanch ke liye blad sample lene se pehle salmaan kii sahmati zaruri thi, lekin form par salmaan ke dastakhat nahin paae gaye

 Sports Minister Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore has written a letter to Commonwealth Games Federation President Lewis Martin, urging him to increase the quota space for India in next year's 21st Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast, Australia
 bharat ko agle rashtramandal khelon main 135 khilaadiyon kaa kota diya gaya he
 However, some other players can make it through the qualification process
 vahiin 2014 glasgo rashtramandal khelon main bharat ke 223 khilaadiyon ne bhaag liya tha or bharat padak talika main paanchaven sthaan par rahaa tha
 Rathore, who was an Olympic silver medalist shooter, has demanded 40 additional quota places in fishing, boxing, para sports and athletics
 pitiai ke mutabik rathod ne 15 november ko likhe patr main kaha, ‘main 2018 rashtramandal khelon main bhartiya dal ke kota ke sandarbh main aapako likh rahaa hum
 This time India has been given a quota of only 135 players while 223 players from India participated in the 2014 Games and finished fifth in the medal table
 ’unhone likhaa, ‘bharat sarkaar ne olympic sangh se mashvire ke baad 2018 khelon main bharat ke liye padak kii sambhaavnaaon par vichaar kiya he
 India's performance has improved significantly in many sports and this time more medals can be won than last time
 ’ unhone kaha ki bharat kii aabaadi or padak kii sambhaavna ko dhyaan main rakhkar bharat kaa kota badhaayaa janaa chahie
 Rathore wrote, 'given the population of India and the possibility of Indian players winning medals, this time the quota places have been given very less
 main aapse anurodh karata hum ki mukkebaaji, nishanebaaji, para khelon or athletics main atirikt 40 kota sthaan die jaae or sahyogi staff ko bhi badhaane kii anumati di jaae
 India finished fifth in the table by winning 64 medals including 15 gold, 30 silver and 19 bronze at the last Commonwealth Games in Glasgow
 rashtramandal khelon main bharat kaa sarvshereshth pradarshan 2010 main rahaa jab dilli main hue in khelon main bharat ne kul 101 (38 swarna, 27 rajat or 36 kaansya) padak jitkar doosraa sthaan paaya tha
 With the end of the campaigning for the seventh phase of Lok Sabha elections, there has been a stir among the opposition leaders
 kisi bhi dal ko purna bahumat nahin milane kii surat main vipakshi dalon kii sarkaar ke gathan ko lekar vipakshi netaaon ne apane str par 'mishan sarkaar' par kaam karnaa shuru kar diya he
 TDP chief and Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu has started meeting opposition leaders as part of the exercise to unite them
 dakshin ke 2 bade netaa mukhyamantri chandrababu naidu or tiares adhyaksh ke chandrashekhar raav vipaksh ko ekajute karne ke jhandabardaar banakar saamne aae hai
 Chandrababu Naidu, who was on 'mission Sarkar', met Congress President Rahul Gandhi on Saturday morning
 is mulaakaat ke baad naidu lakhanu ke liye ravaanaa ho jaaenge jahaan wo mayawati or akhilesh yadav se aaj milane vaale hai
 On Tuesday, Naidu also met Congress leader Abhishek Manu Singhvi and thereafter Naidu met Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) convenor and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal
 donon netaaon ke bich nateezon ke baad kii ranneeti par kaaphi der tak baatcheet hui
 After meeting Kejriwal, Naidu also discussed the possibilities of forming a coalition government with the Left leaders
 dilli ke upmukhyamantri manish sisodiya or party ke varisht netaa sanjay singh bhi is dauraan maujuud the
 Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu also wanted to meet UPA chief Sonia Gandhi, but this meeting could not be possible
 dilli main shuukravaar ko kejariwal se mili naidurahul gandhi ke saath naidu kii yah mulaakaat is myne main bhi khaas he kyonki ek din pehle shuukravaar ko rahul gandhi ne gathbandhan se sarkaar banane ke sanket die the
 Congress President Rahul Gandhi made it clear that his aim is to prevent BJP from returning to power
 iske liye wo vipaksh ke har formule par sahmati ko raji he
 This formula is likely to be discussed in the meeting with Naidu
 rahul gandhi se mulaakaat ke baad naidu lakhanu ravaanaa ho jaaenge jahaan vah aaj hi samaajawaadee party pramukh akhilesh yadav or bahujan samaaj party kii mayawati se milane vaale hai
 This meeting is important because if the possibility of a third front is seen after the election results, then the role of the Grand Alliance will be very important in it
 sonia kii sharad pavaar se aaj mulakatis sabake bich aaj rashtravaadi congress party (ensipi) supremeo sharad pavaar or sonia gandhi bhi mil sakate hai
 Apart from Naidu, Telangana Chief Minister k Chandrasekhar Rao is also trying to unite the opposition
 chathe charan ke chunaav ke baad chandrashekhar raav ne pichley hafte kerala jaakar mukhyamantri or makapa netaa pinarai vijayan se mulaakaat kii
 After this he went to Chennai on Monday and met DMK leader MK Stalin

 The DMK refused to leave the Congress
 chunaav parinaam 23 may ko aaenge, lekin nateezon se pehle hi vipakshi netaaon kii in baithkon ke daur ne siyaasi galiyaaron kaa paara badha diya he
 It remains to be seen how successful Naidu and KCR are able to unite the opposition

 sabhi ke khilaaf court se gairajamaanti warrant bhi jari ho gaya, lekin 2 maheene se lakshmi uske maalik or mahavat kaa koi suraag nahin lag paa rahaa tha
 An alert was sent to all states to search for Lakshmi
 yusuf ali ne haal hi main ek akhwar ko die intervyuu main bataaya ki wo 2 maheene se lagaataar lokation badal rahaa he

 Excerpts from Chief Talk of Chief Minister Vijay Bahuguna to India Today chief correspondent Piyush Babelle: What is the conflict between the Sadhu Samaj and Uttarakhand government on the hydropower projects? If anyone thinks that he is a devotee of Ganga and others are not, then it is not like that 
 mudda yah he ki parvatiy rajya ko vikaas main aage le jane ke do hi madhyam hai, paryaton or jal vidyut
 We cannot touch the forest
 agar jal vidyut bhi paidaa na karen to rajya ko vind ap kar dena chahie
 Do you agree with the uninterrupted flow of the Ganges or not? We also want that there should be uninterrupted flow in the Ganges, but we or the sage-mahatma should not decide how much the flow should be
 ye kaam paryaavaran visheshgyon ko karne den
 Do not be insistent on this sardiyon ke maheene main jab nadi main pani kam rahata he, ham bijli kaa utpaadan rokane ko bhi taiyaar hai
 What do you want? If we can sell electricity then Uttarakhand will become an economically capable state
 paryaton ke vikaas ke liye bhi buniyadi dhaancha chahie
 Will we keep begging the Center for everything? The center will either let us make electricity or generate between 15,000 and 20,000 crores every year

 The Aam Aadmi Party has accused Sports Minister Vijay Goel of taking advantage of tax from the North Delhi Municipal Corporation to get the heritage building
 AAP netaa dilip pandey ne mangalvaar ko press conference kar daawa kiya ki emsidi ne property tex main vijay goyal ke 25 karod rupee maaf kiye hai
 Party leaders are also seeking legal advice for action in this matter
 aapke dilli sanyojak dilip pandey ne maamle se jude notification laharaate hue aarope lagaaya ki dharmpura ilaake main kendriya mantri vijay goyal ne ek heritage building kharidi thi or us haveli par lagane vaale kul 25 karod rupee ke tex ko apni oonchi pahunch kaa istemaal karke emsidi se maaf kara liya
 He said that the way in which Sports Minister Vijay Goyal has brought the country and his party to the Olympics, in return, perhaps his party has given him a reward by giving him a benefit of Rs 25 crore
 lekin jab iskaa emsidi ke andar virodh hone laga to vijay goyal ne emsidi se us puure ilaake ke hi property tex samet tamaam tex maaf kara die, jiske daayre main kul 750 imaaraten aa gayi
 Taunting the Municipal Corporation, Pandey said, "the Municipal Corporation does not pay salaries to its sanitation workers by pretending to be short of funds
 shahar main saaf-safai nahin ho paati
 In spite of all this, the MCD takes great care of the tax imposed on the leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party and is forced to waive it
 dilli ke log chahen beshak kooday ke dher par rahen, chaahe dilli main dengue, chikangunia yaa phir malaria faile, usase bijepi shasit emsidi ko koi fark nahin padataa
 MCD takes full care that BJP leaders should benefit from crores
 agar bhrashtachari sansthaaon kii list banaai jaae to emsidi us list main top karegi
 The Aam Aadmi Party has also asked these 4 questions to the BJP and the central government
 
 
 1
 Does this tax waiver of Rs 25 crore against the law not fall under the category of economic crime? 2
 centre sarkaar ke maatahat aane vaali jaanch jensiyaan or bhrashtachar nirodhak sansthaaen kya is aarthik aparaadh kaa sangyaan lekar koi karrwai karengi?3
 Will Vijay Goyal resign from his post for an impartial inquiry into the matter? 4
 vijay goyal ke istipha na dene kii sthiti main kya bhartiya janata party apane is netaa par koi karrwai karegi? Recently we had talked about how to buy Blackberry, iphone and Windows if you want to buy a new smart phone
 ab aakhir main baat uski, jise kam se kam, market share ke hisaab se, smart phone kii duniya kaa baap kaha ja saktaa he
 You understand right, we are talking about Android itself! You can guess the popularity of Android with the fact that today 80% of the market for smart phones is occupied by it
 yani har paanch main se chaar smart phone, android oparating system par chal rahaa he
 Every day more than 1
5 million people are buying a new Android device
 isi saal andrid, ek aise aankade ko chhu legaa jiske aasapaas pahunchnaa kisi bhi company ke liye ek sapana hota he
 In 2014, the number of Android users will cross one billion
 ek billian logon ke haathon main pahunchane kaa safar android ne sirf chah saalon main puraa kar liya
 The first Android phone to come on the market was the HTC Dream which was launched on 22 October 2008
 aaj andrid software kii maalik google he lekin isaki khoj google ne nahin kii thi
 The 'android Ink' company was founded in 2003 by Andy Rubin along with a few people
 lekin baad main company kii mali haalat khasta ho gayi
 At that point of time, Google got an eye on this company which was engaged in making a new type of software for smart phones
 2005 main google ne 'android inc' ko kharid liya
 You must know that every version of Android is named after a dessert
 Cupcake, Donut, Eclair, Froyo, Gingerbread, Honeycomb, Ice Cream Sandwich, Jelly Bean se hota hua ye mithe kaa silsilaa ab Kit Kat tak aa pahunchaa he
 Have you noticed that the name of each version is moving in alphabetical order
 C, D, E, F
 
 
 So you start thinking about sweet things starting with l which could be the name of the next version of Android and we will tell you what is important for Android buyers to know
 kyon he android kaa jaadu laajawab-1
 Make the phone as you want: Customization, that is, the freedom of making changes in the phone according to your own, is the biggest feature of Android
 agar aap khud ko tech savvy maanate hai, phone kii gaharaai main jaakar har feechar ko apane hisaab se set karnaa chaahate hai, to android jaisi chhot koi doosraa phone aapako nahin degaa
 From the phone launcher to the look, from the homepage to the animation level, it is possible to create everything according to your mind
 blueberi, yphone or windos aapako aisi chhot nahin dete

 google kaa humsafar he androydgoogle ke bina aaj internet kii duniya ke bare main sochna bhi mushkil he
 If you, like me, are crazy about Google, then you can not think of any phone other than Android
 google ke tamaam aplikeshns jaise search, google map, you-tub chalate to tamaam duusare phones main bhi hai, lekin android main maamla do sharir ek jaan jaise yaarana kaa he
 It is a matter of thinking that if Android is the child of Google, then some things will definitely happen that others will not get
 google map khud main hi alladin kaa chiraag he or iske bheetar itane feechar chhipe hai ki aap hairaan rah jaaenge
 a company like Apple tried to create its own map to compete with Google Map and put it in iphone
 itani gaaliyaan padi ki appal ko na sirf apane yugers se maafee maangani padi balki laut kar phir se google map kii sharan main aana padaa

 'google Now' he karamaati jinnalambe samay se smart phone istemaal karne waalon kaa sapana tha ki unka phone unase baat kare, unki baat sune or samajhe
 Not like a robot - but like a human, in conversational language
 Google Now ne is sapane ko saakaar kar diya he
 This is the magic that understands without knowing what time you need information and keeps appearing in front of you - it will tell you how the traffic is going on the way you are going to office, take an umbrella from home Whether it is needed or not, and it will also tell you what the position of the flight you have to go this evening will come at the right time or late - and all this without asking
 Google Now sirf android 4
 Available in versions 1 or above
 haalanki google ne ise ab yphone ke liye bhi uplabdh kara diya he
 4
 eps kaa akut khajanagoogle play store main 10,00,000 - yani das lakh se zyada eps hai or unki sankhya lagaataar bad rahi he
 Just understand that if you want to download every app and try it for five minutes, then it will take you more than ten years
 duniya main har tarah kii pasand, har tarah kii jarurat ke liye ap yahaan maujuud he
 Even if you do not want to buy an app, there are so many free apps that you will not miss the lack of a credit card
 5
 Reducing dozens of phone budgets for every budget can never become an obstacle in the way of buying Android phones
 chunki google tamaam phone companiyon ko android software muft main muhaiyaa karaata he isliye android phone banane vaali companiyon kii bharmaar he
 From cheap homegrown brands to biggies like Samsung and HTC, they are in the field and now they have heard that their old known Nokia is also preparing to bring Android phones
 to android kii duniya main bajet kam hone kaa matlab ye nahin ki aapako purana, basi or duniya bhar main outdetate ho chukaa yphone 4 khareednaa padegaa
 But also know about Android-1
 suraksha ke hisaab se sabase kamjorendroid software 'open sorce' he yani koi bhi iske liye ap bana saktaa he
 This makes Android weak in terms of security
 ek nahin tamaam research main ye baat saaf ho chuki he ki kisi bhi haikar ke liye android phone ko hack karnaa kisi or phone ke mukaable aasaan he
 Be it malware or shoddy fake apps, the Google Play Store is a hangout
 ap ko bazaar main utaarne ke maamle main google kaa quality control acha nahin kaha ja saktaa

 naye puraane varjan kaa chakkarkitna bura lagegaa aapako jab aap apane gadhe paseene kii kamai se ek nayaa chamchamata hua phone kharid kar laaen or aapkaa dost phone ko haath main lekar kah de - are, ye to outdetate he! android phone ke maamle main ye khub hota he
 Actually Android software provides companies by making Google, but every phone company makes some changes with Android software to make their phone different, to make it different identity, and put it in their phones
 nateeja ye hota he ki jab google android software kaa nayaa or behatar varjan laanch karata he to aap sidhe apane phone main ise downlod nahin kar sakate
 You will have to wait that your phone company will prepare and provide you with Android software according to your phone model
 kai baar ye intjaar kabhi khatm nahin hota kyonki phone companinyaan puraane model ke liye android kaa nayaa varjan laati hi nahin
 Currently, the latest version of Android software is Kit Kat
 lekin ye jaanakar aap sir peet lenge ki philhal do fisadi se bhi kam android phones main kitcat kii mithaas he
 3
 betry kaa chakkarbetry vaise to har smart phone kii dukhati rag he 
 But this problem is the most in Android
 darasal, android ek behad hi powerful software he jise multitasking ke liye banaaya gaya he
 But being powerful also means that it needs more battery dose
 isliye kai baar log apana phone zyada garm hone kii shikaayat bhi karte hai
 It is very important to look at the power of the battery while purchasing an Android phone, otherwise you will be seen searching for the charger before the day is over
 raahat kii baat sirf ye he ki zyaadaatar android phone main aap nayi betry kharid kar khud se badal sakate hai
 Like the iphone, you don't even have to go to the service center to change the battery

 Due to the glut of cheap phones, Android phones are sold under the name, so everyone wants to wash their hands in this flowing Ganges
 tamaam companiyaan itane saste main phone bech raheen he jise dekhakar kisi kaa bhi man lalachaa saktaa he
 But Android phones made with free software and cheap Chinese goods can also be a headache for you
 kai companiyaan aisi hai jo android kii lokapriyata ko bhunaane ke liye china se thok ke bhav sasta phone mangati hai or apane naam kaa thappa laga kar bechati hai
 If these phones go bad, then the service center of the company will be tired of searching you all over the city and it will take twenty days to get the phone fixed
 ye baaten phone kharidne se pehle soch len
 As we talked earlier, Android is like a powerful engine that needs strong hardware to run
 isliye agar aapkaa bajet aath hajaar se kam ho to android ke bajaay windos phone kharidne kii sochen
 5
 hang or krash hone kii museebatpurane hone par sabhi phone kuch slo ho jate hai
 But old waste gets stored in Android phones in such a way that it is difficult to get rid of it
 aap play store se tamaam clinar ap aajamaate hai lekin aap dekhenge ki phone main wo baat nahin rahi
 Sometimes the phone will hang, sometimes it will crash, sometimes it will become so slow that you will get angry
 saste kam ram vaale phone main ye musiibat zyada aati he
 Sometimes you will see that you have removed all photos, songs, videos - everything from the phone, even then the phone will continue to show Low Memory and you will not be able to download any new app
 bahut se logon ko ye baat bhi sirdard lag sakati he ki aae din phone main koi na koi ap apadet hota rahata he or aapke data kaa bill badhaata rahata he
 Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan has said that the country's biggest mafia is sitting in the house of Congress President Sonia Gandhi

 congress bekaar logon kii party ho gai he
 He said that the biggest land mafia in the country is Robert Vadra, who is in the house of Congress President Sonia Gandhi
 damaad robert unke ghar main baitha he
 The Congress has shattered the self-respect of the country

 Shivraj said that the Congress, which has given the slogan to remove poverty, should learn from us how poverty is removed
 unki sarkaar ne garibi hataane ke liye har jaruri kadam uthaae hai

 Madhusudanakati, a village in Gaighata block (north 24 Parganas district), 14 km from the indo-bangladesh border, may not have the rest of the amenities, but people here drink only packaged water
 darasal, is ilaake ke zyaadaatar gaanvon kepani main arsenicki maatra zyada hone ke kaaran yahaan kaa pani pine laayak nahin hota
 Water comes in government channels, but it is not enough to meet the needs of every family

 a water treatment plant has been built here
 is plant main yahaan ke do talabon ke pani ko purifai karke or bottle main band karke gaanvvaalon ko mahaj pachaas paise prati litre kii dar se uplabdh karavaaya ja rahaa he
 In addition to Ganga Jal, North 24 Parganas district for fifty paise, water purifier plants have also been set up in Mayapur and Murshidabad district of Nadia district
 khaas baat yah he ki in donon jilon main ganga ke pani ko saaf karke itani hi keemat main uplabdh karavaaya ja rahaa he
 KJ Nath, chairman of the Arsenic Task Force of West Bengal, said, "drinking water with arsenic for a long time increases the risk of many cancers
 ' unhone bataaya, 'pashchim bengal main 1
 6 crore rural population and 1
 2 karod shahari jansankhya un ilaakon main rahati he jahaan kaa pani arsenic se buree tarah dooshit he
 To ensure that the villagers do not have to drink arsenic dissolved water, Sulabh International and French company 1001 Fontaine, along with local NGO Madhusudanakati Krishak Kalyan Samiti, have set up a water treatment plant in the village at a cost of twenty lakh rupees
 yahaan se har din 8,000 litre pani purifai hota he
 The water cleaned with UV technology is transported from 'sulabh Jal' to a 20 liter bottle at the rate of Rs 10 per bottle
 sulabh international ke sansthaapak bindeshwar pathak ne kaha, 'ham mahaj pachaas paise prati litre kii dar se peyajal uplabdh karvaa rahe hai
 It is not like mineral water but it is the cheapest safe drinking water in the world
 'deshbhar main pair failaane kaa iraadaapaschim bengal ke teen jilon main saaf pani pahunchane kii yojana safal hone ke saath hi sulabh international ise desh ke baaki hisson main bhi le jane kii taiyaari main he
 The next stop will be Bihar, Kerala and Tamil Nadu
 desh main alag-alag brands kaa bottleband pani 15 se 20 rupee prati litre kii dar se miltaa he
 In such a situation, the idea of providing clean bottled water for only fifty paise can mess up the whole mathematics of the business of spoken water

 surajevaala ne kaha tha ki hamane kaha he ki yah kadachar he
 His nomination should be rejected

 'congress ne smriti irani kaa udaaya majaak, bole- kyonki mantri bhi kabhi graduate thim
 
 
 See Video, while retaliating on the Congress, Irani said that i would say that in the last five years there is no such attack which some 'disciples' of the Congress have not committed on me
 aisa koi apshabd nahin he, aisa koi apmaan nahin he, mahila hone ke naate aisi koi pratadna nahin he jo mere saath congress netaaon ne na kii ho
 My only message to them is that the more you humiliate me, the more you harass me, the more i will work against the Congress in Amethi

 The story is based on the true events of the life of a frontierman named Hugh Glass
 isse pehle unke jivan par 'main in da wildernas' (1971) naam se bhi film ban chuki he
 In the film, the persecution of Native Americans continues in the background and the atrocities of white people with them continue to resonate throughout the film
 hew ki mul nivaasiyon se sahanubhuti he
 One day, he encounters a bear and is badly injured
 uske saathi use kadaake kii thand ke bich marane ke liye chhod jate hai
 One of his companions, Fitjerald (tom Harzie), hates the natives and kills Hue's son
 bas yaheen se sarvival kii jang shuru hoti he, or dam todta ek banda maut se ladane lagata he or apane bete kaa badla bhi use lenaa he
 All these things come as a surprise
 film main rishton ko lekar samvednaaen hai to vipareet halaat se jujhna bhi dikhaaya gaya he or rongte khadey kar dene vaale drishyon kii bhi koi kami nahin he
 Anyway, the name of the film is 'the Revenant', that is, coming back from death
 inyaritu kii filmein kahani ke nae dhang or cinemetography ke nae prayogon ke liye jaani jaati he, or vah cinema ko chunauti bharaa kaam maanate hai or in chunautiyon kaa bakhubi saamana karne main bhi yakeen rakhte hai
 The shooting of 'the Revenant' has been performed in the US, Canada, and Argentina
 film kii shooting -30 se -40 degree taapmaana ke bich bhi kii gai he
 Not only this, they had to travel for about two to two and a half hours daily to reach the location with their crew
 film ko natural lite main hi shoot kiya gaya he
 In this way, the shooting of the film was slow
 film main drishyon ke liye bahut zyada special effects kaa istemaal nahin hua he or sabhi seen prakruti kii god main shoot kiye gaye hai
 Before the opening scene of the film was shot, a rehearsal was held for a month
 inyaritu kii yah film bahut hi aasaani se samaj main aati he or bollywood film premiyon ke liye bhihollywoodki taraf se aisi saugat he jo unhen bharpoor majaa detii he
 Which has all the aspects like action, revenge and love, which are enough to keep her tied
 hollywood or bollywood donon hi film premiyon ke liye 'da revenent' kisi treet se kam nahin he
 Son kills and father is punished
 kam se kam raman singh kii salaah to yahi kahati he
 At the inauguration of the Science Center, Raman Singh said that all the qualities in children come from the father, so how can children be responsible for mistakes
 chhattisgarh ke mukhyamantri raman singh ne kii vigyaan kii baarikiyon par baat
 The occasion was the inauguration of the Science Center in Raipur where Raman Singh gave a speech discussing DNA and genes
 vigyaan kii moti jaankaree rakhane vaale jaanate hai ki maa-baap se milti-julati surat or gun- dosha diene ke jariye bachche tak pahunchati he
 Even many diseases come with DNA from one generation to another
 lekin diene kii jaisi vyakhya raman singh ne kahi use aapane pehle kahin nahin suna hoga
 Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Raman Singh said that DNS and jeans have been in operation for thousands of years
 main bolta hum ki agar betaa galati karata he to baap kii thukai kerani chaiye kyonki gun to apane baba se hi le rahaa he
 If he is stealing, robbing, raping, then there is absolutely no fault of his son
 hamane usko aisa banaaya he jaisaa hamaara khun he jaisi hamaari diene he jaisi hamaari soch he vaise hamaara betaa he
 The culprit is not the son, the father is
 mukhyamantri raman singh ke is bayaan par vipaksh ne bavaal machaa diya
 The question of Congress is whether Raman Singh is talking about a change in the law
 rajya main congress ke netaa or vidhansabha main netaa vipaksh nand kumaar patel ne kaha ki manunase poochna chahta hum ki is tareeke ke bate karke wo rajya kii janata par kya sandesh dena chaahate he
 i would also like to say that if they think that as many criminals are in jail, they want to leave them all and they want to lock their father in jail
 ye unka soch he unke is kathan se ye baat darshata he
 Let us also assume that the Congress is opposing Raman Singh due to politics
 to bete kii galatiyon kaa apradhi pita kyon
 After all, he too got all this from his father
 phir asli apradhi kii talash main kitni peedi peeche jaaenge raman singh
 Perhaps to explain the DNA, the Chief Minister failed to choose an example
 sawaal ye bhi he ki kya naksali samasya se nipatane ke liye bhi diene theory kaa istemaal karenge raman singh
