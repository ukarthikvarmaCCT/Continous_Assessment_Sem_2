 ek din 10 ghanta 20 minute kii deree se pahunchi or ek din 23 ghanta 16 minute kii deree se
 Therefore, our question is whether rail passengers, like air travelers, should not be compensated for the loss caused by delays

 If you make the right demand then it will happen exactly
 koi problem hi nahin he

 In view of this, AIMIM of Owaisi has decided to contest 50 assembly seats in Maharashtra
 lekin dalit netaa or bhimrao ambedkar ke pote prakaash ambedkar ke netritv vaali vanchit bahujan agaadi (vibie) unhen mahaj 8 siten dena chaahati he
 Due to this, AIMIM has severed ties with Bahujan Agadi and has decided to enter the electoral arena alone
 lekin prakaash ambedkar abhi ovaisi se gathbandhan karne kii kavayad main hai
 For this, he has constituted a three-member committee and Prakash Ambedkar says that i will wait till the last day for an alliance with Owaisi
 is saal loksabhaa chunaav main prakaash ambedkar or ovaisi kii party milakar maharashtra main maidan main utre the
 Owaisi's party AIMIM managed to win one seat
 saath hi kul daale gaye mat kaa 14 fisadi vot hasil karke is gathbandhan ne sabko hairaan bhi kar diya tha
 This alliance had significantly damaged the congress-ncp in about 12 Lok Sabha seats
 jabaki isse pehle 2014 ke maharashtra vidhansabha chunaav main AIMIM 25 siton par chunaav ladi thi or 2 siten jeetne main kaamyaab rahi thi
 This is the reason that now AIMIM wants to expand its base even further

 aise main agar unhen gathbandhan karnaa he to seat ko lekar tasviir saaf karen
 He said that Prakash Ambedkar wants to give just 8 seats to AIMIM
 jabaki hamane 50 siton par chunaav ladane kaa faisla kiya he
 We have also announced the names of our candidates on 12 seats
 aise main agar unhen gathbandhan karnaa he to jald koi faisla len, nahin to ham akele chunavi maidan main utarane ke liye taiyaar hai
 At the same time, Prakash Ambedkar did aajtak
 in se baat karte hue kaha ki hamaara gathbandhan hona pehle se tay tha
 At the time of Lok Sabha elections, the Congress had told us that if we leave Owaisi, we will form an alliance
 us vakt hamane congress ke bajaay ovaisi ke saath janaa pasand kiya
 AIMIM itself broke ties in the assembly elections
 jabaki ham abhi bhi chaahate hai ki gathbandhan ho, iske liye hamane teen sadasyeey cameti bhi banaai he
 This committee has to decide
 haalanki ham chunaav ke aakhri din tak ovaisi ke gathbandhan kaa intjaar karenge

 The reason behind leaving the job is also told that he may not be wanting to do jobless
 naukari chhodane ke peeche kii vajah yah ho sakati he, lekin isaki badi vajah kuch or he jise jaanakar aapako hairaani hogi
 1
 karmchaaree na to naukari bos ke kaaran chhodte hai, na hin kaam ke pressure ke kaaran
 They leave the job because of their supervisor
 Tiny Pulse ke survey ke anusaar, karmchaaree aksar profeshnal tareeke se kaam karnaa chaahate hai
 If their supervisor does not cooperate with them, they consider it better to leave the job
 2
 At the same time, colleagues are the second major reason for this
 agar acha kaam karne parasahakarmiyon se tarifan mili to achche karmchaariyon ko lagane lagata he ki offis main unke kaam ko tavajjo nahin di ja rahi he isliye bhi ve naukari chhodane kaa faisla karte hai

 Neerja's character played by Sonam Kapur now seems to be overshadowing the role of Kangana's queen
 darasal ek tikat booking kii mashhoor portal ne apni sait par voting karwaai or poocha ki unhen film queen main kangana kaa kirdaar zyaada acha laga yaa film neeraja main sonam kapur ? sait kaa daawa he ki is pole main sonam ne kangana ko haraa diya jahaan sonam ke paksh main 52% darshakon ne vot kiya vahiin 48% darshakon ko kangana kaa abhinay zyaada pasand aayaa he
 Kangana's performance in Queen was highly acclaimed and for this she has received National Award
 lekin ab neeraja ke baad sonam ke saath bhi aisa hi ho rahaa he or ise unke jivan kaa abtak kaa sabase behtareen abhinay kaha ja rahaa he
 Also, Neerja has beaten Queen in terms of earnings
 yah bhi mumkin he ki agle aword sizan main neeraja or sonam kaa jaadu chale kyonki film kii saraahna or safalataa saath saath ho rahi he
 Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj has disappointed her fans by declaring not to contest the 2019 general elections, but her husband is very happy with the decision
 sushamaa ke pati swaraj kaushal ne patni ke faisle ke baad silsilewar kai twit kar kaha –ab or chunaav nahin ladane ke aapke faisle ke liye dhanyavad
 Swaraj Kaushal said that i remember Milkha Singh had to stop at one time
 yah daud 1977 se shuru hui thi
 It has been 41 years now
 aap ab tak 11 chunaav lard chuki hai
 AAP did not contest elections only twice in 1991 and 2004, because the party did not let you enter the electoral fray
 main pichley 46 saalon se aapke peeche bhaag rahaa hum
 Now i am not 19 years old
 idhar sushamaa ke faisle par congress netaa pi chidambaram ne siyaasi bayaan de diya he
 Chidambaram has tweeted that after seeing the bjp's condition in Madhya Pradesh, Sushma has 'left the field'
 chidambaram ne tanj karte hue kaha ki sushamaa smart hai
 At the same time, Congress leader Shashi Tharoor expressed his disappointment over Sushma Swaraj's decision not to contest the 2019 elections, saying that as a foreign minister in Parliament, i have always found her generous
 sirf chunaav nahin ladengi, raajnneeti main bani rahengelekhak swapndas ko jawaab dete hue sushamaa ne saaf kiya ki ve sirf 2019 kaa chunaav na ladane kaa elaan kar rahi hai
 She will remain in politics
 andruni siyasat kaa nateeja to nahinsushamaa swaraj kaa chunaav na ladane kaa elaan apratyaashit tha
 Questions arose from this decision whether he was troubled by health or the internal politics of the BJP
 poocha jane laga ki keval 66 baras kii umr main sushamaa swaraj jaisi diggaj netaa ko chunaav se sanyas kaa man kyon bananaa padaa? is elaan se pehle unhone na party se poocha or na hi party ko isaki hawa thi
 It is famous that the style of speech Sushma Swaraj has created today is not the same
 yah pad or pratishtha unke sangharshon ke silsile kaa arjeet he
 His speech style is noted
 unke bhaashan ke mureed satta or vipaksh donon kataron main hai
 Surprised by the decision at the age of 66, 66-year-old Sushma Swaraj is a very experienced leader of the party
 lekin achaanak is faisle se sawaal uthanaa lajimi he, kyonki 66 kii umr koi sanyas ke elaan kii nahin hoti
 At times it was felt that Sushma is not comfortable about her position in the government, but each time she deferred such questions
 sawaal uth rahe hai ki kya vaaki bijepi ko unke tajurbe kii jarurat nahin rah gai he
 In 2016, ailing Sushma Swaraj was ill for a long time in 2016
 gurde ke oparation ke baad ames main bhartee rahi thim, lekin iske baad wo phir se sakriy ho gai thim
 Everyone seemed that now it is normal, but moving towards 2019 elections, the BJP was not sure that Sushma Swaraj would not even ask the party, declaring not to contest
 mahatma gandhi ne desh se angrejo ko bhagane ke liye satyagrah kiya tha
 Which he started in 1917 from Champaran in Bihar
 sau saal baad unke champaran yatra kaa shatabdi samaaroh manaaya ja rahaa he
 Another Satyagraha is going on in Bihar after a century
 ye satyagrah bandaron ko bhagane ke liye hai
 This Satyagraha is being done in Jehanabad to drive away the monkeys

 This satyagraha has been done to catch a monkey
 stesan ke paas bandar kaa terarajahanabad railway stesan ke paas is bandar kaa aatank is kadar he ki log train pakadaney ke liye bhi vahaan jane se pehle sochate hai
 The monkey's terror has been around for the past 5-6 months
 shahar ke log is bandar se nijaat paane ke liye kai barjila prashasanako likh chuke hai, van vibhaag ko bhi aavedan kiya gaya he, lekin ab tak koi samaadhaan nahin nikal sakaa
 More than one thousand people were made, the dreaded monkey has killed 1000 to 1200 people so far and has become its prey
 bacchon se lekar mahilaayein har kisi ko ye bandar apana nishaanaa bana rahaa he
 Not even Netaji was spared RJD Netabakunth Yadav could not escape the terror of the monkey
 unhone kaha ki ham bhi stesan ke paas baithe the tabhi bandar ne hamalaa kar ghayal kar diya
 The monkey injured his neck
 bataa den ki 2015 ke vidhansabha chunaav main mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ke poling booth par bhi ek bandar ne aatank machaaya tha
 In which many journalists were also injured

 Every new person to be appointed to government service will have to declare their hometown to take advantage of LTC

 Under this, they get leave clearances and ticket payment

 inputah bhashaa Examiners associated with the reinstatement of 69000 assistant teachers in Uttar Pradesh have given a good introduction to their democracy
 adalati tarikhon main pariksha kaa parinaam saat-aath maheenon se fansaa he
 i keep seeing pictures of demonstrations of students associated with this exam
 ravivaar ko ek tasviir mili jisamen bahut sari ladkiyaan apane haath upar kii hui hai
 Everyone has folded their hands so that the police standing in front of them does not shower sticks
 unki is apil kaa police par asar bhi hua
 Gandhiji has given moral strength to face the brutalities of the state
 yah vahi naitik bal he jiske dam par ladakiyon ne apni or saathi ladakon kii raksha kii
 i would like to appreciate the commitment of the boys and girls involved in these photographs of the performance
 video or tasveeron main ladke ladkiyaan aapas main ghulkar apane haq kii ladaai lard rahe hai
 i think this is a beautiful picture
 mujhe in parikshaarthiyon par garv he
 Salutations! The good thing about this movement is that all have come from different districts of Uttar Pradesh and have brought the plank banner in their hand
 is vakt main jab media kii praathamikta badal gai he ye chaatr- chatraayen alag-alag zilon se aakar pradarshan kar rahe hai
 The good thing is that girls have also come in good numbers in this movement
 shaayad sabhi pehali baar mil rahe honge
 Girls will also meet at the picket site
 inkaa kahana he ki sarkaar ne jo paatrata tay kii he usee ke anuroop pariksha paas kar chuke hai
 When the government took out the form, it gave a month's time in the examination date
 ab riselt aane main aath maheene kii deree kyon ho rahi he
 Demanding their results, the students staged a demonstration outside the SCERT office in Lucknow
 aath maheene se ye chaatr pariksha ke parinaam kaa intazaar kar rahe hai
 The date in the court has been extended eight times
 saat sunwaayee main mahadhivaktaa gaye hi nahin
 Hence the hearing is not held and the date is extended
 shiksha mitra court gaye or jeet gai
 The government went to double bench for this decision
 shiksha mitron ko pichhali naukari ke kaaran gres mark mili hai jiske kaaran nai pariksha main zyaada ank laane vaale chaatr pichad gaye
 Because of this the matter went to court
 dharne main shaamil chaatr court se haar gaye lekin ab ve chaahate hai ki sunwaayee jaldi ho or parinaam aae
 The decision of single bench came in March 2019
 is pariksha ke parikshaarthiyon kaa samooh kahata he ki march ke aadesh se 110 number laane vaale chaatr baahar ho jaaenge
 The government made a mistake by making the scale after the examination
 unki yah baat thik lagati he
 So it was understood that there are two groups in this exam
 donon aamane saamne he
 The government has gone double bench against the verdict
 dabl bench kii sunwaayee ke liye sarkaar kii taraf se mahadhivaktaa upasthit nahin ho rahe hai
 The hearing is on 19 September
 media ne in chaatro ne apni seemaa se baahar kar diya he
 These students are also beginning to understand the media game
 media ko bharosa he ki ye chaatr uske hindu muslim propeganda ke savartha gulam hai to vah galat he
 Yet the media business goes on without the public
 tasveeron main chaatro ko dekhakar bharosa hua ki abhi sab nahin mare hai na ghulaam hue hai
 Even though these democratic demonstrations are not discussed in Delhi or anywhere else, i am excited to see them
 naagarik banane kii prakriya chote se hi samooh main sahi magar jari he
 In the end, the government has to stand up to make it accountable
 69000 shikshak bahaali ke chaatro ne karke dikhaa diya he
 Please seriously consider the role of media which has become embarrassing
 27 agast ko inhone pehla dharna diya tha
 Performed 36 hours on 11 and 12 September
 is pariksha main chaar lakh se adhik parikshaarthi riselt kaa intazaar kar rahe hai
 a bit disappointed in terms of numbers
 kaash sabhi chaar lakh shaamil hote
 If someone could not join the picket due to economic compulsion, then he should be exempted but those who did not come home sitting for selfishness and cleverness should understand that there are people like him who are weakening the aspirations of democracy
 ve ghar baithe laddu kha lenaa chaahate hai
 Yet, regardless of such selfish people, the pioneering of a few hundred people is a beautiful picture of this time
 ho saktaa he ki riselt aane par dharna-pradarshan main shaamil kuch kaa chayan na bhi ho lekin tab bhi unhone ek jaays haq kii ladaai ladi he or yah ladaai jivan bhar kaam aegi
 Their inner fear is sorted
 ummid he sangharsh ke dauraan ladke-ladakiyon ne kuch siikhaa hoga
 Must have felt the ruthlessness of the state system
 jin sarkaron ko ham dharm yaa jhooth ke aadhaar par chun lete hai yaa sahi samaj ke aadhaar par chunane ke baad bhi thage jate hai, unke saamne khadey hone kaa yahi ekmaatr jaays rasta he
 The path of non-violence and endurance
 mujhe bharosa he ki aapane pradarshan ke dauraan apane akelepan ko mahasoos kiya hoga
 a blind nationalism filled with lies based on you
 sampradayikta ne aapako khokhla kar diya he
 He is still within you all
 aapane abhi tak use apane kamare se baahar nahin nikaala he
 Therefore, even after this unmatched display of citizenship and democracy, the face of the state will not change
 kyonki aap hi nahin badale
 The relevance of any performance should not be limited to just the result
 agar aap or sarkaar kii na badale to vah yatnaa duusare parikshaarthiyon par jari rahegi
 i wish it was good that the victims of other examinations would have been included in your performance or you would have also made it big by joining their small performance and put a question before the state that when will we get a transparent and honest examination system? Your inner self is being used by politicians
 aapako ek din is andh rashtrawaad ke khel ko samajhnaa hi hoga
 i have no complaints with you youngsters
 ummid bhi nahin he
 i know the reason for this
 aapke saath dhokhaa hua
 Be it Jaunpur, Sambhal or Ghazipur or Unnao, the schools and colleges there were made inferior
 class main achche shikshak nahin rahe
 Your student life went in vain
 kaash aapako acchhee or gunvatttawali shiksha mili hoti to aap or laayak hote or desh or sundar banataa
 There is no chance of change in these conditions
 bas ek juthi ummid paalane kii galati karuunga
 When any of you become a teacher, you will become a good and honest teacher
 khud bhi padhegaa or chaatro ke angan ko gyaan se bhar degaa
 This will not happen, yet what goes into expecting
 philhal pradarshnon ke prati aapaki patibaddhta ke liye badhai dena chaahunga
 You have burnt life in this democracy of bezan and cowardice

 2012 main bijepi ne 403 main se 47 siton par jeet hasil kar upi vidhansabha chunaav main teesraa sthaan hasil kiya tha
 Two years later, in the Lok Sabha election campaign led by Narendra Modi, the BJP won 337 seats, which is considered historical in many ways
 vahiin 2012 vidhansabha chunaav main 226 seat jeetne vaali samaajawaadee party ne 2014 loksabhaa chunaav main mahaz 42 siton par kabja jamaaya tha
 To win in UP, the party will have to get 202 seats out of 403 i
e
 35 percent votes
 agar loksabhaa chunaav par najar daalen to sapa ne 42 seat yani 30 pratishat vot paae the
 At the same time BJP got 337 seats i
e
 43 percent votes
 2012 main yah aankada maatr 15 pratishat tha
 The comments satta main aane ke liye bijepi ko 2014 main ai modi lahar main 'nae votaron' ko baandh kar rakhana hoga
 Reason - BJP supporters, who contributed 25 percent in the last assembly election vote
 lekin loksabhaa chunaav main yah 43 fisadi pahunch gaya
 So the benefit from the Modi wave was about 18 percent
 or jeetne ke liye unhen kam se kam 35 pratishat kii jarurat he
 That is, he can afford to lose 8 percent of the vote and to win, the BJP will have to retain 10 percent of the new voters from the Modi wave in 2014
 saaf taur par samajhane ke liye ek nazar is graphic par - On the other hand, Samajwadi Party and Congress get 35 percent votes from their traditional voters
 2014 main modi lahar ne inke hisse ko mahaz 30 pratishat par laakar khadaa kar diya tha
 Remember, at least 35 percent of the votes are required to stay in the race
 to is baar gathbandhan ko jeetne ke liye un votaron ko waapas laana hoga jo 2014 main bijepi ke paas chale gaye the
 Among the groups that went to BJP in 2014, upper caste and Jatav Dalits are important
 2014 main yadavon ne sapa ko dhokhaa nahin diya tha or musalmaan votaron kaa saath 5 percent se bad gaya tha
 (muslim votes went to SP and Congress to deal with Modi wave
 ) So the math is that the sp-congress alliance has 35% traditional vote which fell to 30% in 2014
 yani uske haath se paanch percent voter chale gaye the
 At least 35 per cent is needed to win - then the alliance will have to bring back the five per cent they lost in the Lok Sabha elections to win
 or baat mayawati kii
 In 2014, he received 20 percent votes
 unke mukhya samarthak - jatav dalit unke saath hi rahe the, thik usee tarah jaise modi lahar ke baavjood yadav, sapa se hile nahin the
 But Mayawati's non-jatav Dalit, forward caste and non-yadav OBC votes went to the BJP
 unke paramparaagat voton kii ginati 25 pratishat he
 In 2014, it was reduced to 20 percent
 35 pratishat jaruri he
 So it is imperative that he get 15% more this time - that is, to bring back 5 percent of the votes cast by hand and 10 percent of the new voters - which is more challenging than the target of his rival parties
 upi main jeet hasil karne ke liye party ko 403 main se 202 seat yani 35 pratishat vot hasil karne honge
 If we look at the Lok Sabha elections, SP got 42 seats i
e
 30 percent votes
 vahiin bijepi ne 337 seat pain thi yani 43 pratishat vot
 In 2012, this figure was just 15 percent
 tippaniyan To come to power, the BJP will have to tie up 'new voters' in the 2014 Modi wave
 kaaran - bijepi ke jo khantee samarthak hai, unhone pichley vidhansabha chunaav ke vot main 25 pratishat yogadan diya
 But it reached 43 percent in the Lok Sabha elections
 to modi lahar se mila phayda kareeb 18 pratishat rahaa
 And they need at least 35 percent to win
 yani vah 8 pratishat vot khone kaa khatra mol sakate hai or jeetne ke liye bijepi ko 2014 main modi lahar se mili nae votaron ke 10 pratishat hisse ko banaae rakhana hoga
 a look at this graphic to understand clearly - vahiin duusari ore samaajawaadee party or congress ko 35 pratishat vot apane paramparaagat votaron se milte hai
 In 2014, the Modi wave raised their share to just 30 percent
 yaad rahe, res main bane rahane ke liye kam se kam 35 fisadi vot milane jaruri hai
 So to win the alliance this time, the voters who had gone to the BJP in 2014 have to be brought back
 jo samooh 2014 main bijepi ke paas chale gaye the unamem oonchi jati or jatav dalit ahm he
 In 2014, the Yadavs did not betray the SP and the Muslim voters had grown by 5 percent
 (modi lahar se nipatane ke liye muslim vot, sapa or congress ke paas gaye the
 ) to ganit yah he ki sapa-congress gathbandhan ke paas 35 percent parpanraagat vot he jo ki 2014 main girakar 30 pratishat ho gaye the
 That is, five percent voters had left his hand
 jeetne ke liye kam se kam 35 pratishat chahie - to gathbandhan ko jeet hasil karne ke liye un paanch fisadi ko waapas apane kheme main laana hoga jinhen unhone loksabhaa chunaav main kho diya tha
 And the talk of Mayawati
 2014 main unhen 20 pratishat vot mili the
 His main supporters - the Jatav Dalits had stayed with him, just as Yadav was not shaken by the SP despite the Modi wave
 lekin mayawati ke gaiyr-jatav dalit, agadi jati or gaiyr-yadav obisi ke vot bijepi ke paas chale gaye the
 His traditional vote count is 25 percent
 2014 main yah 20 pratishat rah gai thi
 35 percent is required
 to jaruri he ki is baar vah 15 percent or hasil karen - yani haath se nikle 5 pratishat vot ko waapas laaen or 10 pratishat nae voter - jo ki unki virdohi partiyon ke torget se kahin zyada chunauteepurn hai
 To come to power, the BJP will have to tie up 'new voters' in the 2014 Modi wave
 kaaran - bijepi ke jo khantee samarthak hai, unhone pichley vidhansabha chunaav ke vot main 25 pratishat yogadan diya
 But it reached 43 percent in the Lok Sabha elections
 to modi lahar se mila phayda kareeb 18 pratishat rahaa
 And they need at least 35 percent to win
 yani vah 8 pratishat vot khone kaa khatra mol sakate hai or jeetne ke liye bijepi ko 2014 main modi lahar se mili nae votaron ke 10 pratishat hisse ko banaae rakhana hoga
 a look at this graphic to understand clearly - vahiin duusari ore samaajawaadee party or congress ko 35 pratishat vot apane paramparaagat votaron se milte hai
 In 2014, the Modi wave raised their share to just 30 percent
 yaad rahe, res main bane rahane ke liye kam se kam 35 fisadi vot milane jaruri hai
 So to win the alliance this time, the voters who had gone to the BJP in 2014 have to be brought back
 jo samooh 2014 main bijepi ke paas chale gaye the unamem oonchi jati or jatav dalit ahm he
 In 2014, the Yadavs did not betray the SP and the Muslim voters had grown by 5 percent
 (modi lahar se nipatane ke liye muslim vot, sapa or congress ke paas gaye the
 ) to ganit yah he ki sapa-congress gathbandhan ke paas 35 percent parpanraagat vot he jo ki 2014 main girakar 30 pratishat ho gaye the
 That is, five percent voters had left his hand
 jeetne ke liye kam se kam 35 pratishat chahie - to gathbandhan ko jeet hasil karne ke liye un paanch fisadi ko waapas apane kheme main laana hoga jinhen unhone loksabhaa chunaav main kho diya tha
 And the talk of Mayawati
 2014 main unhen 20 pratishat vot mili the
 His main supporters - the Jatav Dalits had stayed with him, just as Yadav was not shaken by the SP despite the Modi wave
 lekin mayawati ke gaiyr-jatav dalit, agadi jati or gaiyr-yadav obisi ke vot bijepi ke paas chale gaye the
 His traditional vote count is 25 percent
 2014 main yah 20 pratishat rah gai thi
 35 percent is required
 to jaruri he ki is baar vah 15 percent or hasil karen - yani haath se nikle 5 pratishat vot ko waapas laaen or 10 pratishat nae voter - jo ki unki virdohi partiyon ke torget se kahin zyada chunauteepurn hai
 Reason - BJP supporters, who contributed 25 percent in the last assembly election vote
 lekin loksabhaa chunaav main yah 43 fisadi pahunch gaya
 So the benefit from the Modi wave was about 18 percent
 or jeetne ke liye unhen kam se kam 35 pratishat kii jarurat he
 That is, he can afford to lose 8 percent of the vote and to win, the BJP will have to retain 10 percent of the new voters from the Modi wave in 2014
 saaf taur par samajhane ke liye ek nazar is graphic par - On the other hand, Samajwadi Party and Congress get 35 percent votes from their traditional voters
 2014 main modi lahar ne inke hisse ko mahaz 30 pratishat par laakar khadaa kar diya tha
 Remember, at least 35 percent of the votes are required to stay in the race
 to is baar gathbandhan ko jeetne ke liye un votaron ko waapas laana hoga jo 2014 main bijepi ke paas chale gaye the
 Among the groups that went to BJP in 2014, upper caste and Jatav Dalits are important
 2014 main yadavon ne sapa ko dhokhaa nahin diya tha or musalmaan votaron kaa saath 5 percent se bad gaya tha
 (muslim votes went to SP and Congress to deal with Modi wave
 ) So the math is that the sp-congress alliance has 35% traditional vote which fell to 30% in 2014
 yani uske haath se paanch percent voter chale gaye the
 At least 35 per cent is needed to win - then the alliance will have to bring back the five per cent they lost in the Lok Sabha elections to win
 or baat mayawati kii
 In 2014, he received 20 percent votes
 unke mukhya samarthak - jatav dalit unke saath hi rahe the, thik usee tarah jaise modi lahar ke baavjood yadav, sapa se hile nahin the
 But Mayawati's non-jatav Dalit, forward caste and non-yadav OBC votes went to the BJP
 unke paramparaagat voton kii ginati 25 pratishat he
 In 2014, it was reduced to 20 percent
 35 pratishat jaruri he
 So it is imperative that he get 15% more this time - that is, to bring back 5 percent of the votes cast by hand and 10 percent of the new voters - which is more challenging than the target of his rival parties

 India's players too
 africa par dabaav banaakar unki isi kamazori kaa faaydaa uthaanaa chaahate hai
 3) Great Indian batting - Achieving success in the shortest format is not a big deal for a team that has batsmen like Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli, MS Dhoni and Suresh Raina

 Disappointment was seen in Shaheen's style while making a prophecy on Tuesday, which is still going on! The video of Shaheen's latest prophecy on the Spaniard, which was revealed this time, is also clearly seen in the manner of Shaheen
 shaheen ne spain or chile ke bich hone vaale world cap match ke liye spain par daanv lagaaya he
 During the prophecy, Shaheen did not show enthusiasm in making his choice even today, while still holding the board of the team of his choice in the air

 police ne aaropee pati ko giraftaar kar liya he or pati sahit uske parivaar ke 4 anya sadasyon par dahej hatya kaa cese darj kar liya he
 Police said that the incident is from Bisarkh police station area
 aaropee ne mangalvaar kii dopaher jab apni patni kii hatya kii, us samay par puri tarahanshe main dhuttha
 According to the information, about 3 hours after killing his wife, the person called his elder brother and informed about the whole incident
 hatyaropee ke bade bhai ne hi police ko suchit kiya
 The police, who reached the spot after receiving the information, have sent the body to the post-mortem after taking possession and have started searching for the other accused
 police ne mritka kii pahchaan ikraa or aaropee pati kii pahchaan akil ke taur par kii he
 Let me tell you that Iqra was married to Akil, a resident of Noida, in February 2015
 sutron ne bataaya ki aae din akil or uske parivaar vaale ikraa se dahej main car or kaarobaar ke liye paise kii demand karte the
 On expressing his inability to ask for dowry from his parents, Akil used to beat him with alcohol, due to which Iqra lived mostly in his maternal home in Meerut
 hatya karne se 4 din pehle hi akil meerut apni sasuraal gaya or maafee mangakar patni ikraa ko waapas laayaa tha
 After returning from Meerut, Akil started renting a flat with his wife in Shahbari village under Bisarkh police station area
 achaanak mangalvaar kii dopaher nashe main dhut akil galaa dabaakar ikraa kii hatya kar di
 Police said that a case has been registered against 5 people, including accused husband Akeel, on the tahrir of Ikra's maternal uncle
 philhal police akil ko giraftaar usase poochtacha kar rahi he or anya aropiyon kii talash main bhi jute gai he
 There has been tension between India and Pakistan since the terror attack in Pulwama, Jammu and Kashmir
 isi bich pakistan ne bharat se apil kii he ki seemaa par tanaav kam karen
 Pakistan has made this appeal through diplomatic channel
 pulavama hamale main bharat ke 40 jawan shahid hue the, jiske baad bharat ne airstrike kii thi or donon deshon ke bich tanab badhata gaya tha
 India is constantly talking to Pakistan to take action against terrorism and only then it is asking to come to the negotiating table
 sarkaar ke sutron kii maane to pakistan ne khud is baar apil kii he line of control par shanti baratane kii jarurat he
 Earlier, in the middle of the month of April, Pakistan also tried a similar peace
 gauratlab he ki is saal pakistan ne 900 se adhik baar sijafire ulanghan kar chukaa he jiskaa hindustan ne har baar munhtod jawaab diya he
 India is under pressure that so far in May, Pakistan has violated ceasefire only 9 times in 10 days and is at peace with the loc
 agar is saal ke aankadon par nazar daalen to is baar kul 982 baar pakistan sijafire todaa he
 In this, Pakistan has acted 203 in January, 2015 in February, 267 in March and 234 times in April
 may main abhi tak sirf 9 baar sijafire kaa ulanghan kiya ja chukaa he
 It is now being said from Pakistan that their country is constantly monitoring the situation and trying to control it
 bharat kii taraf se jab balakot main airstrike kii gai tab se hi seemapar se ghuspaith par roak lagi hui he
 Significantly, after the Pulwama attack, India not only gave Pakistan backward diplomatically but also responded in a military manner
 bharat kii koshish kii vajah se hi sanyukt raashtra ne jaish-e-mohammad ke sargana moulana masood ajahar ko global aatanki ghoshit kiya

 Today, 45 years of the Chipko movement has been remembered by search engine Google by making doodles
 is andolan kii shuruyaat 1974 main pedo kii raksha ke liye uttarakhand main hui thi
 One of the main things of the Chipko movement was that women participated in large numbers in it
 jaisaa ki doodle main dikhaaya gaya he ki kaise mahilaayein pedo ke aas-paas unhen bachaane kii koshish kar rahi he jaise andolan ke dauraan kiya tha
 This movement started from Uttarakhand and spread throughout the country
 bataa den, 1973 main gaura devi ke netritv main ped katane se bachaane ke liye mahilaayein pedo par chipak gayi thim
 Through this movement, he asserted his traditional authority over forests
 is andolan ko vyapak rup paryaavarnavid sunderlaal bahuguna or chandiprasad bhatta ne diya tha
 Rainbow show for 9 consecutive hours here, made world record about the beginning of the movement
 
 
 26 march, 1974 ko pedo kii kataai rokane ke liye 'chipko andolan' shuru hua tha
 That year, when an auction was made to cut about two and a half thousand trees in the forest of Ranini village in Uttarakhand, a woman named Gaura Devi along with other women opposed the auction of trees
 iske baavjood sarkaar or thekedaar ke nirnay main badlaav nahin aayaa
 When the contractor's men arrived to cut down the trees, Gaura Devi and her 21 companions tried to convince them
 jab unhone ped kaatane kii jidd kii to mahilaon ne pedo se chipak kar unhen lalakaara ki pehle hamen kaato phir in pedo ko bhi kaat lenaa
 These are the 10 smallest countries in the world, less than 1 thousand population, the contractor had to bow down in front of the opposition of women
 baad main sthaneey van vibhaag ke adhikariyon ke saamne in mahilaon ne apni baat rakhi
 After which the forest of Rani village was not cut
 is prakaar yaheen se 'chipko andolan' kii shuruyaat hui
 The movement started because of this, during the movement, Gaura Devi, who had studied up to the fifth class, had an understanding of the environmental science and her understanding, by working her life against the gun, playing her life, she gave him only work of Ranee village
 No, he made the hero not only of Uttarakhand, but of the whole country
 videshon main unhen‘chipko Woman from India’kaha jane laga
 Chipko movement is a tale of indomitable courage and understanding of Gaura Devi, a tribal woman
 ye he duniya kii sabase mahangi chocolate, keemat 6 lakh rupaeandolan ke baad mila phaaydauttar pradesh main is andolan ne 1980 main tab ek badi jeet hasil kii, jab tatkaaleen pradhanmantri indira gandhi ne pradesh ke himalayan wanon main vrikshon kii kataai par 15 saalon ke liye roak laga di thi
 In later years, this movement spread to Himachal Pradesh in the north, Karnataka in the south, Rajasthan in the west, Bihar in the east and Central India
 ye andolan pedo kii kataai ko rokane main safal rahaa
 At the same time it was also successful in creating pressure for more conscious natural resource policy towards the needs of the people and environment
 vahiin is andolan ke baad baat kii jaae to aaj bhi pedo ko dhadlle se kaata ja rahaa he
 Maulana Ghulam Mohammad Vastanvi was created seven months ago by Darul Uloom Deoband, the highest educational institution of Deobandi Maslak with high hopes and lofty goals
 gujarat ke udaar or pragatisheel aalim moulana vastanvi ko vahaan se jis jabariyaa tareeke se hataaya gaya, vah jitna vismayakari he utana hi sansanikhej bhi he
 It will take time for the special experts of Islamic circles here to understand the whole game
 moulana vastanvi kaa is puure vivaad or khud ko hataae jane ke faisle par kya kahana he yah jaanane ke liesurendra singhalane unki daarul ulum se vidaai ke fouran baad or phir europe ke daure par unke landan pahunchane par unase lambii baatcheet kii
 Maulana Vastanvi, with a smile on her face at all times, presented her vision with great simplicity, humility and modesty
 pesh he unase kii gai baatcheet ke anshajis sanstha kii majalise-shura ke aap pichley 10 saalon se sadsy hai or jahaan aapako mohatamim pad kii jimmedaari sanbhale saat maah bhi puure nahin hue the vahaan aakhir aisa kya ho gaya jo aapako jabaran hataa diya gaya?main maharashtra ke akkalkuan main desh kaa sabase bada shikshan santhaan jamiya-islamia ishatul ulum chalaata hum
 Mufti Abul Qasim, who had been working as a caretaker for a month at the Majlis-shura meeting convened in Deoband on January 10, 2011, after the death of Mohtamim Maulana Murgubur Rahman of Darul Uloom on December 8, 2010, The place majlisse-shura chose me as Mohtamim
 main iske liye na to taiyaar hokar aayaa tha or na hi is pad kaa icchhuk tha
 But following the sentiments of the Shura members and following the dictates of Allah, i agreed to accept the new responsibility
 lekin mere saamne aae gut ko yah manjuur nahin hua
 i had not even started working, that the tricks to remove me started
 talimi or saamaajik kshetra se judaa hone kii vajah main sajishon ko na soongh sakaa or na hi main unki kaat jaanata tha
 i tried to stay there and work but eventually my harriffs who disliked me forcibly removed me from there
 aakhir iske peeche aap kya vajah maanate hai?har koi jaanata he devband main ek khaas lobby he jiskaa main naam nahin luungaa
 They consider this institution as their legacy
 unka vahaan par jabardast varchasv he
 Without his will, there is no leaf that can stand
 mere vahaan baithne se un logon ko apane vajood par khatra najar aane laga
 The brightness of those people started to fade in front of me and even in Deoband, my noise was heard instead of them, which they did not lose
 us lobby ne hi mujhe sajeesh ke tahat hataane kaa kaam kiya he
 In Darul Uloom, people are fully aware of the entire incident of my posting as Mohtimim
 use yahaan bataane kii jarurat nahin he
 Who were the people behind the conspiracy? Those who were my Harif (mukhalif), i will not take their name
 jaanch samiti par aapkaa etraj kya he?maine saare maamle shura main rakhane ke liye 23 farvari ko hangaami baithak bulaai thi
 a three-member inquiry committee of Shura was formed on my proposal therein
 jaanch ke teen mudde tay kiye gaye the
 An investigation into the veracity of my alleged statements in the media about giving a clean chit to a Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi and allegations of distributing idols on me; To find out the campaigns run by Madarsa students to remove Mohtamim and the masters who provoke students
 23 july ko shura kii baithak main pesh kii gai jaanch report puri tarah se adhuri thi
 In it, only one issue related to me was investigated and the remaining two questions were dropped
 is par meraa or duusare saathiyon kaa etraj tha
 Due to incomplete inquiry report, i was not ready to resign as per my declaration
 maine baithak main kaha bhi ki ve duusare do muddon kii bhi jaanch karaaen or uske nattejey saamne aane den to uske baad main yah pad chhod duungaa
 But most of the members of Shura did not agree to it and that is why i was adamant about not resigning
 kya aap aapako hataane main shura kii apanaai prakriya se sahamat hai?shura kii ek vishesh lobby se jude sadasyon ne apane aakaaon ke mujhe hataane ke 'km ko puraa karne kii khatir daarul ulum ke dastur (in) yani samvidhan ko balaaye taak par rakhkar mujhe manamaane dhang se hataane kaa kaam kiya
 The four scholarly members who supported us - Mufti Ismail Kasmi, Maulana Badruddin Ajmal, Maulana Yakub Madrasi and Sadar Mudarris Maulana Saeed Ahmed Palanpuri of Darul Uloom objected to this and voted against the removal of me
 lekin maine daarul ulum kii garima or pratishtha banaae rakhane kii khatir shura ke is faisle ko bhi kabool kar liya
 You are a liberal Islamic scholar and educationist
 aisi surat main ab aapkaa kya karne kaa iraadaa he?maine court main na jane kaa faisla kiya he
 i will not go public even on this issue
 meraa apana bada madrasa he
 There is a big role for me
 main phir se apane us kaam ko dekhuunga or aage badhaaungaa
 i do not believe that any kind of controversy should be raised about a large organization of Muslims like Darul Uloom
 main daarul ulum kii shura kaa sadsy bana rahoonga or ek sadsy ke taur par pehle kii tarah is sanstha kii nisthapurvak seva karata rahoonga
 Do you think that there is no place for any liberal Muslim scholar and administrator in Deoband today? From what has happened to me, it is clear that without the will of a particular lobby there is no place for anyone
 mujhe to vahaan kaam karne kaa mauka hi nahin diya gaya or bina koi galati kiye sajaa de di gai
 It is not true in any way of justice, morality, religion and logic, but it has been done by the ulama din of a supreme civil society, which i deeply regret
 kya aap samajhte hai ki aap roodhiwaadee or badlaav virodhiyon kii sajishon kaa shikaar hue hai?main aisa nahin maanata ki daarul ulum par roodhiwaadiyon yaa kattarpathiyon kaa kabja he
 i have said that Darul Uloom is occupied by a special group where they run arbitrarily
 main usee gut kii sajishon kaa, jo shuru se mere saamne ada hua tha, shikaar hua hum
 What have you changed about your earlier statements about Narendra Modi and Gujarat, now what do you think about the changed circumstances? i interviewed an English newspaper representative in Surat (gujarat) about the development of Narendra Modi and Gujarat
 i gave, i always stood by that
 darasal, jin baton kaa maine khandan kiya ve mere us intervyuu ko lekar urdu press ke ek section dwaara tod-marodakar or ek gut vishesh ke ishaare par chhaapi gai thi
 i have asserted many times in the media that what i had said to the newspaper representative in the beginning had printed exactly the same
 lekin durbhaagya se meri kahi gai baton ko anyathaa liya gaya
 i am not a political lightheart, i am from the education sector
 mujhe siyaasi takaajon ke myne maaloom nahin hai
 i have never turned back from my words
 kya aap abhi bhi apane mul bayaan par kaayam hai?main aapke is sawaal kaa jawaab de chukaa hum
 Do you believe that the administration of Deoband (darul Uloom) has been taken over by radical forces? It is not occupied by fundamentalists, as i have said earlier, the possession and domination of a particular faction (lobby)
 ek udaar islamic vidwaan or shikshavid hone ke naate ab aapasi kya bhoomika rahane vaali he
 i am a man of education
 mere paas dini, aadhunik or takneekee, chikitsa, ejineering ke bade shikshan sansthaanon kii lambii shrinkhalaa he
 i will take this work further
 musalamaanon ko shiksha ke kshetra main oonchaaiyon tak pahunchaana meraa pehla mishan he

 ‘laila’ kaa matlab farsi main hota he syah baalo vaali sundari yaa raat
 The question that must have arisen in the minds of many people is how the storm that caused havoc in the coastal parts of Andhra Pradesh got the name 'laila'
 shaayad iskaa jawaab pakistan ke paas he
 An official of the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) said that when the World Meteorological Organization entrusted the IMD to monitor and name storms in the Indian Ocean, Pakistan suggested the name 'laila' to the IMD
 mausam vaigyanikon ne aasaani se pahchaan karne or tufaan ke tantra kaa vishleshan karne ke liye unke naam rakhane kii parampara shuru kii
 Now the names of storms are named according to the process prepared by the World Meteorological Organization
 adhikari ne bataaya ki bengal kii khadi or arab sagar ke upar banane vaale tufaanon ke naam 2004 se rakhe jane lage
 Being a regional specialized meteorological center, IMD issues meteorological advisories to seven other countries Bangladesh, Maldives, Myanmar, Oman, Pakistan, Thailand and Sri Lanka apart from India
 adhikari ke anusaar, iemdi ne in deshon se bhi tufaanon ke liye naam sujhane ko kaha
 These countries gave a list of names according to the order of the English alphabet
 purvanumaan or chetavanee jari karne kii khatir vishisht pahchaan dene ke uddeshy se 64 naam sujhaaye gaye jinamein se ab tak 22 kaa upyog kiya gaya he
 According to the cycle, the name 'laila' was suggested by Pakistan for this storm
 agle tufaan kaa naam ‘‘bandu’’ hoga jiskaa suzav srilanka ne diya tha
 The main northern Indian Ocean tropical season lasts from May to November, and the first storm of this season was Nargis
 tufaanon kaa naam rakhane kii parampara 20 sadi ke shuru se chal rahi he jab ek austrailian visheshgy ne un raajnneetigyon ke naam par bade tufaanon ke naam rakhe jinhen vah pasand nahin karata tha
 The US Meteorological Department began naming storms from 1953 onwards
 up mahadweep main yah chalan 2004 se shuru hua
 The official said the names of the meteorologists, when more than one storm was active on a basin at the same time, also eased confusion
 har saal vinaashkari tufaanon ke naam badal die jate hai or puraane naamon kii jagah nae naam rakhe jate hai
