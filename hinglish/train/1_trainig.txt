 gramin dak sevakon ke kai saare video aae hai
 Watching a trend in these videos
 surat ke kapadaa vyapaaree bhi jab andolan kar rahe the tab unka ek video aayaa tha
 In that video, they are singing songs, pleading pleasantly as someone does to their girlfriend, there is no outrage in those songs, Zindabad is not Murdabad, a similar video has been found, you see and understand that the Grameen Dak Sevak What do you want to say? hamane muzaffapur ke gramin dak sevak se baat kii
 They told that they have been taking postage to the villages since the British era
 postal vibhaag ke tahat kaam karte hai magar vibhaag unhen apana karmchaaree nahin maanate hai
 These people have won their battles against the Supreme Court and CAT but they are not yet recognized as employees
 jabaki ye gaanv-gaanv main cycle chalaakar chitthiyaan baantate hai
 Meanwhile, after increasing the price of petrol continuously for 16 days, it has become amazing today
 1 paise sasta ho gaya, jabaki antarrashtriya bazaar main kachche tel kii keemat saadhe chaar dollar kam ho chuki he
 1 Do not underestimate the lack of money
 brake ke baad ham mandsaur or cancer par ek zaruri report dekhenge
 Isn't it less how much work they do
 saare sarkari bank aitihaasik ghate se guzar rahe hai
 His condition is continuously deteriorating
 iske alag alag kaaran hai magar sabakaa prabhaav yahi he ki 2017-19 main bainkon kaa ghaataa ab kai hajaar karod kaa hone laga he
 We are going to report the losses of some banks
 punjab neshnal bank kaa ghaataa- 12, 282 karod, idibiai kaa ghaataa 8,237 karod, esbiai kaa ghaataa 6547 karod, bank of india kaa 6043 karod, oriental bank of carmas kaa ghaataa 5871 karod, union bank of india kaa ghaataa 5247 karod he
 Make a question to yourself, are there so many weak and negative bankers sitting in every bank that because of them, losses of up to 80,000 crores have been incurred or someone else will be responsible for this
 jaise ki sarkaar, prabandhan, udyogpati
 Today's Business Standard has a report that the NPA of the small finance bank has also gone up to 5-6 percent, from 1 percent in the year before demonetisation
 enpie matlab lone liya magar chukaa nahin paae
 Business Standard itself has reported that 1 lakh 40 thousand crores have been added to the npas of 37 banks in the fourth quarter of 2017-18
 kya iske liye bhi aam banker zimmedaar he
 The facts should be looked at properly before making an assumption
 isliye bankeron ne apni maang patr main is baat ko shaamil kiya he ki aksar staff ko der tak kaam karne ke liye baadhya kiya jaataa he, uskaa samay darj ho
 Verbal orders should be discontinued, written orders for changes in the time of work
 kisi bhi staff ko lagaataar saat din se zyaada kaam karne ke liye baadhya na kiya jaae
 They should not work more than eight hours, they should be asked to work only 40 hours a week
 sabhi shanivaar ko chuttee he jo ab shaayad hi kabhi milti he
 Obviously, bankers have to do more than this
 tabhi unki mangapatr main in baton kaa zikr aayaa he
 There is also a demand that transfers should be discontinued for bullying and coercion
 maang patr ko dekhne se lagata he ki banker selary to chaahate hai magar kaam karne ke halaat main bhi bhayankar giravat ai he
 There is also a demand for pension which no one wants to talk about now
 vidhayak saansad khud pension lete hai magar dusron ko peshan na mili iske liye nitiyaan banaate hai
 You are currently seeing pictures of Grameen Dak Sevaks from different places on the screen, for the last 17 days, Grameen Dak Sevaks across India have been on strike
 ye tasviren gramin dak sevakon kii hai, jo hairaan hai ki paune do lakh dak sevak hone ke baad bhi unki hadtaal ko kawarej nahin mil rahaa he
 When there is no discussion on a million bankers, then a quarter to two lakhs should also understand that real people do not come in media democracy
 in dak sevakon ko bhi poochna chahie ki hadtaal se pehle akhabaaron or channelon main kya dekh rahe the, kya pard rahe the, kya unhone apwaad chhodkar aam logon kii awaz dekhi he, jab nahin dekhi to unki awaz kaise nazar aegi

 is aawaaj kii apni ek khaasiyat he
 There is no need for any other technique to decorate it
 amitabh bachchan or unke shilp ne kai pidiyon par raaj kiya he
 He has completed 50 years in this film industry
 amitabh ne ieenes ke saath saakshaatkaar ke dauraan sabase pehle us ek ghatana ko lekar sandesh diya, jisane unhen haal hi main apaar pidaa pahunchaai he
 "first of all, we express our heartfelt condolences and prayers for our brave soldiers who were martyred in the Pulwama attack and for the brave soldiers who fought for our safety every moment
 "saakshaatkaar ke dauraan kai aise tathy rahe, jinpar hamaare samay ke sarvaadhik lokapriy film star ne thande, sust jawaab die, lekin unki vinamrata hameshaa bani rahi
 Clearly, aura and appreciation does not matter to them
 haalanki duusare log, unke prashansak kuch or soch sakate hai
 Adjectives, hyperbole and rhetoric came their way, but they did not let it dominate them
 abhi bhi log unke mureed hai
 His inner revolution (he was given the name by his father Harivansh Rai Bachchan at the time of his birth, but later changed to Amitabh) is still not quiet, and his quest as an actor is still on
 ek din ke baad doosraa din or usee tarah doosraa kaam, lekin maine ateet main sujoy ke saath kaam kiya he
 i like the story and the director, the suspense and thrill in the story impressed me
 sujoy ne kahani banaai he or vah baichaiyn hai
 He wants perfection from his artists, he is very clear about his thought process and realizing it
 vah cinema ke vyakaran kii bahut acchhee samaj rakhte hai
 Any director, actor, writer, producer, colleague i worked with will all be my favorites
 
 Of course, i did not have any acting training, nor did i knowingly or unknowingly imitate anyone, until our producer-director asked me to do the same and some such opportunities came up
 mujhe na to abhinay kaa koi tarika maaloom he or na to maine kabhi koi badi chalaang hi lagaai
 Marlon Brando, Montgomery Clift, James Dean
 
 i have no craft and neither know what and how other people do to do good
 
 i follow the writer's written words and the director's instructions as carefully as possible
 'blike' ke liye hamane divyangon kii sankethik bhashaa sikhi
 'badla' is a thriller of a different kind
 thriller varsho se aaj bhi hamen baandh kar rakhti he
 'mahal' is still alive in the memories of some people of my generation
 1949 kii is film main ashok kumaar or madhubala ne kaam kiya tha or iskaa sangeet moulik tha
 Both have been part of the strong fabric of Hindi cinema
 (amitabh ne bhi apane shuruaati samay main do bahut joardaar sanspes thriller 'paravaanaa' or 'gahari chaal' main kaam kiya tha)apane peshey main moolmantra kaa arth mujhe nahin pataa
 
 mujhe nahin pataa ki main bhaagyashaalee rahaa hum
 i understand that you are well aware that no person can be very close to the media nor far away
 media chauthaa stambh he, desh kii antaratma he
 i have the ability, or the audacity, to live with my conscience, but not with the media
 iske bare main sochna mere liye morrkhtaa hogi
 i do not understand why you or many others ask me this question
 
 Only wish was to get some other work
 adhikansh baar asafalataa hi mili
 
 nahin, skool main kabhi bhi shakespeare nahin kiya
 
 nahin aisa koi nahin he
 
 samay or paristhitiyaan badal gai hai
 Every profession has changed
 film koi alag nahin he
 The current generation is full of incredible talent
 main is peedi se bahut prabhavit hum, or main saubhagyashaalee hum ki mujhe inamen se kuch ke saath kaam karne kaa mauka mila he
 It is like learning for me
 ve ek alag or vaikalpik duniya ke drushtikon muhaiyaa karaate hai or yah seekhney laayak he
 Never underestimate the credibility, dexterity, intelligence and skill of the writers and producers of today's entertainment world
 ve pichley 100 saalon se adhik samay se hamaari rachanaatmakataa ke pushpit or pallavit hone ke pramaan hai
 It is no joke to remain meaningful and stand still even after 100 years
 yah sammaan laayak he
 Originality is a dialectical terminology
 iskaa bahut saavdhaanee se istemaal karne kii jarurat he
 Wherever you look, sir, this situation is not just with the actors
 balki kya aaj ke samay main har koi apni daal-roti ke liye mehnat nahin kar rahaa he?yah behatar prabandhan ko ek manyata he, vittiya or vyaktigat donon ko
 The good thing is that music and melody have returned to Hindi cinema
 har koi sangeet kaa anand le rahaa he
 Music is touching our soul
 mujhe nahin 'vyavsaayik' yaa 'samanaantar' kya he
 Cinema is just cinema
 aakaar or paridhi, chota-bada kapade naapane ke paimaane hai
 Every generation's interest has changed in every corner of the world, not just in film, but in every sphere of life
 yah ek samay tha, avasar tha or ek sabase sukhad anubhav tha, ek hi film main rajani or camel ke saath

 The BJP is preparing to set the record for the most expensive and most high-tech rally of Narendra Modi in Patna
 is raily ke liye darjanabhar trainen, chah hajaar se adhik bas, gaadiyaan or sainkadon kii taadaat main naaven tak book hai
 The exercise to make Gandhi Maidan the most high-tech till now has also intensified
 intjaar he to modi kaa, jo is garib rajya kii sabase mahangi raily ke duulhaa honge
 On October 27, Narendra Modi will shout from Patna's Gandhi Maidan, but this hunk rally will show the glow of this poor state, which has not been seen in any rally till date
 manch par 30 foot ooncha electronic elidi screen hoga, modi ke peeche darjanon kii taadaad main bade elidi tivi screen puure gandhi maidan main lagenge, taaki jo jahaan baithe modi ko apane kareeb dekh sake
 Sound systems are being sourced from Delhi for this rally, while robotic cameras will make media work easier for the first time
 ganga setu, koilvar pul or rajendra pul par kraine kii tainaati kii ja rahi he, taaki gaadiyaan funsane par nikaali ja saken
 Most hotel rooms in Patna are booked
 kaaryakarta se sattu or gud lekar aane ko kaha gaya he
 There is an order of 2 lakh food packets
 patna ke sabhi hording book kiye gaye hai
 More than 150 archway gates will be installed
 patna ke sabase bade hotel maury ke jiem bidi singh kehete hai, 'hamaare sabhi kamare book hai, jo jaankaree mil rahi uske mutabik puure shahar ke hotalon kaa yahi haal he
 BJP state president Mangal Pandey told how the high-tech preparations for Modi's rally are going on

 a 30-foot LED screen will be behind Modi on the stage, on which the picture of the heroes of Bihar will flash
 robot vaale atyaadhunik camere lagaae ja rahe hai, jo modi ko 22 taraf se cover karenge
 According to estimates, this rally will cost more than 100 crores
 vipaksh ise corporate raily kahkar chutki le rahaa he to bijepi kaa daawa he, jo ho rahaa kaaryakartaaon ke bal par ho rahaa he
 Although bjp's national vice-president CP Thakur says if there is a big and high-tech rally, then the expenditure will be there
 baharhaal taiyaariyon ke lihaaj se modi kii raily abhootpurv banane main bijepi kaaryakarta jute hai, lekin mahangi or hitech raily kii vajah bijepi ko iskaa hisaab bhi dena hoga
 Now the biggest question is whether it will break the record of Modi's other rallies in terms of crowd

 The entire focus of the government is now on gaining revenue

 The Finance Minister said that the burden that is being given to the rich will be easily tolerated
 darasal kisi bhi bajet main aam aadmi ke liye tex kaa masalaa hameshaa sabase badi tension hoti he
 In this series, it has been decided to increase the income tax surcharge in the budget on the millionaires of the country
 kendriya vitt mantri nirmala sitaraman ne aaj desh kaa bajet pesh karte hue kaha ki desh ke vikaas ke liye 2 karod se zyada kamaane waalon par sarcharge lagaaya ja rahaa he
 The Finance Minister announced that those whose income is between 2 crore to 5 crore per annum will be levied an additional surcharge of 3%, while the budget has a provision to impose surcharge of 7% on those having more than 5 crore income
 haalanki bajet main middle class ko iskar main kisi tarah raahat nahin di gai
 It is worth mentioning that while presenting the interim budget of the Modi government's tenure on February 1, the then Finance Minister Piyush Goyal gave a gift to the middle class, freeing up to Rs 5 lakh from the tax mess
 iske saath hi unhone nai sarkaar main tex slab main badlaav ke bhi sanket die the
 But the middle class is now left empty in the budget
 iskar slab main koi badlaav nahin hua

 While 881 mothers died between April 2016 and November 2016
 haalanki jab mahila bal vikaas mantri pankaja munde se sawaal puche gaye to unhone kaha sari mautein kuposhan se nahin hui hai
 TB and other diseases are also responsible for some deaths

 While around six lakh children in the state are malnourished
 yani bajet nahin, mahakme main adhikari nahin, aise main mahila-bal vikaas par maharashtra sarkaar kii praathamikta samajhi ja sakati he
 When the idols and parks are to be built in the priorities of the government, which is in debt of about four lakh crores, then the reason for such indifference is political insensitivity, because children are not vote banks

 The troubles of Lalu Yadav and his party have increased further after a 5-year sentence and a fine of Rs 10 lakh in the third fodder scam case
 lalu yadav ke bina argedy ke liye aage kaa rasta behad mushkil ho jayega, kyonki unki party main lalu yadav jaisaa doosraa koi vyakti nahin he, jo damdaar tareeke se party ke liye chunaav prachaar kar sake or chunaav main jeet dilaa sake
 This is the case of senior JDU leader KC Tyagi
 lalu yadav ko sajasunaye jane ke baad unhone kaha ki ek ke baad ek maamle main lalu yadav jis tarah se doshi qaraar die ja rahe hai, use dekhte hue lagata he ki unase naata todane kaa faisla nitish kumaar ne sahi samay par kar liya
 KC Tyagi said that if we had not left Lalu Yadav at that time, we would have had to take this decision now but due to taking the decision in time, our party was saved from misery
 haalankikasi tyagine is baat se inkaar kiya ki lalu yadav ke jail jane se or lagaataar ek ke baad ek maamle main doshi qaraar hone se unki party ko sahanubhuti kaa phayda milegaa
 He said that Lalu Yadav is going to jail in connection with corruption and scam and not because of any political agitation, so there is no question of sympathy for his party
 buudhvaar ko lalu yadav ko jis maamle main sajaa hui wo maamla us samay kaa he jab lalu yadav bihar ke mukhyamantri the or chibasa se farji patron ke jariye 30 karod rupye nikaale gaye the
 Lalu Yadav is already in jail and decision is yet to come in 4 cases
 kasee tyaagi ne kaha ki is samaylalu yadavaka puraa parivaar is chakkar main buree tarah funs chukaa he ki kisne kahaan kahaan kitni gadabad kii he
 He said that it will also be difficult for the Rashtriya Janata Dal that now the Congress party will pressurize them to demand more seats at the time of the alliance
 tyaagi ne kaha ki "raajnneetik virodh ke baavjood main yah kahuunga ki lalu yadav kaa prachaar main koi jawaab nahin he or vah voton ke dhruvikaran main maahir hai
 Such a leader is no other in the RJD so it would be very difficult for the RJD without him ”
 faisla aane ke baad lalu yadav ke bete tejasvi yadav ne lalu yadav ko doshi qaraar die jane ke liye nitish kumaar or bijepi kii mileebhagat ko kaaran bataaya
 When asked about this, KC Tyagi said that even before this, Lalu Yadav's son had a contempt case because he had made caste charges against the judge
 aaj bhi unke bete kaa bayaan garimapurna nahin he
 He said that the court does not make decisions according to political parties or by caste and the court's decision should be respected by all
 desh aaj 'louhpurush' sardaar vallabh bhai patel kii jayanti manaa rahaa he
 On this occasion, 'run for Unity' is being organized by the Central Government across the country
 dilli main pradhanmantri narendra modi ne 'ran for unity' ko hari jhandi dikhaai
 Also in his address said that the younger generation should not forget the contribution of Sardar Patel
 vaise to sardaar patel congress ke netaa the, us jamaane main jawahar laal nehru, mahatma gandhi ke saath aazaadee dilwane main unki bhoomika kaaphi ahm thi
 But in the last few years, Narendra Modi has created an atmosphere about Patel as if he had been the leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party
 modi lagaataar kehete hai ki mahapurush kisi party ke nahin hote hai, wo desh ke hote hai
 Modi's 'sardar Prem' came to the fore when he started demanding iron from farmers across the country for the 'statue of Unity', the tallest statue of Sardar Saheb in 2013
 us samay modi gujarat ke mukhyamantri the or rashtriya raajnneeti main apane aap ko pesh karne kii koshish kar rahe the
 The work of the Statue of Unity is going on and is going to be completed soon
 iske baad jab modi pradhanmantri bane, to unhone ran for unity kii shuruyaat kii
 And started celebrating this day as National Unity Day
 iske alaava abhi haal hi main gujarat main modi ne sardaar sarovar baandh kaa udghaatan kiya
 Modi said that Sardar Saheb had dreamed of this dam, which we are fulfilling today
 
 
 
 So, not Nehru, Sardar Patel's first Prime Minister of the country has consistently targeted the Congress over this
 modi kehete hai ki congress ne sardaar sahab ke yogadan ko bhuulaane kii koshish kii
 Modi has said on many occasions that if Sardar Patel had been the first Prime Minister of the country, then perhaps the picture of the country would have been different
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne jis tarah pichley kuch samay main mahatma gandhi or sardaar patel ko lekar maahaul banaaya he us par congress bhi unpar nishaanaa sadhti ai he
 PM Modi has consistently alleged that the Congress party tried to erase Sardar Patel's name from history
 desh kii yuva peedi ko unke bare main kuch bataaya nahin gaya
 Sardar Patel tied the country in one thread through sam-daam-dand-bhed, diplomacy and strategy
 sardaar patel ko hamaari desh kii yuva peedi se parichit nahin karaayaa, itihaas ke jharokhe se is mahapurush ke naam ko mitaane kii koshish kii gai
 After all, why is there a need for Patel Modi? Sardar Patel was considered an aggressive leader, he worked to unify the whole country
 iske liye unhone rajavaadon, nawabon ko samajhaayaa or jo pyaar se nahin samajhen unhen sakhti se bhi paath padhaayaa
 Sardar Patel comes from Gujarat, so Modi associates Gujarati Asmita with his name constantly
 PM modi ne kai baarcongress par nishanasadhate hue kaha he ki agar kashmir mudda bhi sardaar patel ke jimme saunpa gaya hota to ab koi vivaad naa rah gaya hota
 There are also elections in Gujarat in a few days, it can be expected that the issue of Gujarati identity will still get more emphasis during the campaign

 in khabaron ne aaj phir tool pakad liya jab madhya pradesh ke siem shivaraj singh chouhan gujarat main vijay roopaani ke shapath grahan se pehle hi laut aae

 When reporters questioned him not to attend the oath taking ceremony, he said, 'I had 2 important programs
 ek kolaras or doosraa mungawali main, isliye main rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah se anumati lekar waapas laut aayaa
 It is noteworthy that by-elections are to be held in Mungavali and Kolaras assembly
 upachunaav ko jeetne ke liye shivaraj puri mehnat kar rahe hai
 Because recently Congress won the Chitrakoot by-election
 vahiin, agar shivaraj singh chouhan ke aadhikarik kaarykram ko dekha jaae to usamen shapath grahan main shaamil hone kii baat kahi gai he
 According to Chauhan's program, he was to leave from Bhopal for Ahmedabad at 8 am
 jahaan se sadak maarg se chouhan gandhinagar main kaarykram sthal pahunchate
 Here he was involved in the swearing in program and 12
 50 par madhya pradesh ke guna liye nikal jate
 Everything happened under Shivraj's fixed program, he did not stop till his swearing in and returned to Madhya Pradesh earlier
 sutron ke mutabik, chouhan kaa shapath grahan se pehle laut aana ye bataata he ki sab kuch sahi nahin he
 Even before this, he has arrived late in his rallies many times
 agar aaj bhi let ho jate to zyada asar na hota
 It is being told that CM Shivraj Singh Chauhan is upset with the discussions about the removal of BJP President Nand Kumar Singh of Madhya Pradesh
 darasal nand kumaar singh par aise aarope lagate rahe hai ki wo sanghathan se zyada shivaraj singh ko lekar samarpit rahete hai
 Also, in Madhya Pradesh, he works for the dedicated people of Shivraj Singh more than the organization
 kai maukon par ye bhi aarope laga he ki nand kumaar shivaraj ke pravaktaa ke taur par har jagah maujuud rahete hai
 Because of this, there is a discussion that before the elections in Madhya Pradesh, his chair is in danger
 bijepi kaa varisht alaakaman unhen hataane kaa plan kar rahaa he
 Shivraj is upset because of these news
 jo bhi ho shivaraj kaa kaarykram se yun chalaa janaa kai sawaal khadey kar gaya he
 Discussions of their displeasure have also become common

 On Sony TV, he made a comeback with the new show 'family Time with Kapil Sharma'

 He did not find Kapil's comedy and the show's concept impressive
 soshal media par phens kapil ko trol kar dil kii bhadaas nikaal rahe hai
 There are many tweets on Twitter that criticize Comedy King's new show

 Some people are calling the show boring and some flops
 sabji bechate najar aae sunil grover, phens ne kiya trolshayad kapil sharma ko bhi ummid nahin hogi ki logon kaa ye riection unhen dekhne ko milegaa
 The trio of Sidhu, Chandan Prabhakar and Kiku Sharda could not save Kapil's show
 is baar kapil ke sho ko kamedi sho kahana sahi nahin hoga kyonki is baar ye game sho ke flavor main saamne aayaa he
 But people did not like this concept
 kuch yugers ne unase puraane formet main waapas aane kii guzarish kar daali
 Kapil's fan followings, which are constantly being criticized by people on social media, are also declining rapidly

 yahi nahin baba ke kehane par usne apane ghar se shivlinga bhi nikaalkar baahar rakh diya lekin koi asar nahi hua
 On the alleged miracle of the miraculous Nirmal Baba, the scholars and religious gurus of Kashi said that their miracle is a deception and deceit of the public, they should be put in jail immediately so that the naive and innocent people can be saved from being deceived and cheated
 lakhanu ke do bacchon, tanya (kaksha baarah) or aditya (kaksha das) kaa maananaa he ki nirmal baba naam se charchit dharmik guru dwaara tamaam lubhaavne vaadon se aam aadmi ko lalachaane kaa kaam kiya ja rahaa he or ek vyakti dwaara desh ke lakhon logon ko dharm kaa bhay or juthi mahatta dikhaa kar unhen bevakoof bana kar dhokhadhadi kii ja rahi he
 Both these children have taken an application for the case against Nirmal Baba to 417, 419, 420 and 508 IPC at Police Station Gomtinagar, Lucknow
 gomti nagar thane me nirmal baba ke khilaaf shikaayat darj ho gayi he
 Though an FIR has not been filed yet, on the complaint of the children, the police has said to start an investigation
 ye donon whupi cader ke ipies amitabh thakur ke bachche he or inaki maa nutan thakur ek saamaajik kaaryakarta hai
 They believed that Baba is promoting superstition in society, so it should be curbed
 madhya pradesh ke narsingpur jile main in dinon third ai nirmal baba kaa prabhaav puure ilaake main joro par he
 People are anxious to get rich and get blessings
 Baba says that a money bag of ten rupees should be packed in the place of money, devotees are looking for new notes
 duusari baat baba kaa kahana he ki jeb main nayaa purse rakhaa karon or kisi se kehete hai ki nayaa belt lagaaya karon or meri photo paisa rakhane ke sthaan par rakho, tum dhanwaan ban jaaoge lekin baba kehete hai ki jo tumhaare paas paisa aayegaa usamen se das pratishat mere account main daalana tabhi phayda hoga
 Blind devotees are following all the orders of Baba, a large number of photos are being sold, people are taking new purses and belts
 kya kisi kii photo or naye purse belt lagane se koi dhanwaan ho saktaa he
 Nirmal Baba, who became the point of faith of spiritual guru and lakhs of devotees, may have taken the title of Guru today, but the same Karma Bhumi of Nirmal Baba is also connected to the Garhwa district of Jharkhand
 jharkhand ke varisht rajaneta inder singh namdhari vaise to nirmal baba ke kareebi rishtedaar hai lekin unke karnaamon se jaraa bhi ittefaq nahin rakhte
 In one conversation, Namdhari clearly said that he has personally advised him not to play with the feelings of the public
 namdhari ne sweekaar kiya ki nirmal baba unke sage saale hai
 He also admitted that he had helped Nirmal to get his career done in the early days
 unhone bataaya ki unke sasur yani nirmal ke pita es es narula kaa kaaphi pehle dehanth ho chukaa he or ve besahaara hue nirmal kii madad karne ke liye use apane paas le aae the
 If Nirmal was not successful in many small and big businesses, he became Baba

 ) On the very first day of assuming office in the Law Ministry, Kapil Sibal overturned former Law Minister Ashwani Kumar's decision on the Vodafone tax liability
 apane faisle main unhone company ke saath sarkaar ke samjhaute kaa rasta saaf kar diya he
 Earlier, Kumar had suggested the way of depositing tax after the opinion of the Attorney General, while the agreement was rejected by both the Law Ministry and the Attorney General
 bataa den ki britani company vodaphone par bharat main kareeb 11 hajaar karod rupee ke kar apvanchan kaa aarope he or is kar ko use chukaana he
 Earlier this year, the Finance Ministry's proposal was rejected by Law Minister Kumar, urging him to adopt the path of compromise
 us vakt kanoonmantralay ne ise gaiyr-kanoonee qaraar diya tha
 Apart from the Law Ministry, the Attorney General had also given his advice against the agreement and said that Vodafone should pay its dues first
 lekin, khaas baat yah he ki sibbal ke kaamkaaj sanbhaalane ke turant baad atorni general ne taaja raay dete hue kaha ki vodaphone se samjhauta kanoonee rup se tarksangat he
 After the approval of the Law Ministry, the matter will now go to the Cabinet
 apni raay main badlaav ke sawaal par atorni general jeei vaahnavati ne kaha ki kanoon ko darkinar karne kii koi koshish nahin kii gai he
 He also said that nothing can be done without the approval of Parliament
 kaha ja rahaa he ki agiai kii raay main parivartan vittamantri pi chidambaram kii ek baithak main rajasav sachiv or kendriya pratyaksh kar ke adhyaksh kii maujuudagi main us safai ke baad aayaa, jisamen chidambaram ne kaha ki samjhaute kaa prastaav na hi kanoon kaa ulanghan karata or na hi iskar kanoon ke tahat kar dendaree main koi badlaav karata he
 Chidambaram also said that there was a proposal for permission from the cabinet to consider issues with Vodafone
 iske alaava vittamantri ne kaha ki vodaphone ke saath kanoon ke daayre main rahakar hi samjhauta kiya jayega
 Along with the functioning of the Law Ministry, Sibal had emphasized that the legal process should not act as a hindrance to economic growth, but should be pursuing it
 tippaniyan Explain that the British company won the case in the same tax case in the Supreme Court and the law was amended to eliminate the effect of the same order
 is badlaav ke baad iskar vibhaag ne vodaphone ko notice bhejkar kaha tha ki company ko 11,217 karod rupee kaa kar may byaaj dena he
 At the same time, in response to this, the company said that the Government of India does not owe anything to them
 isse pehle vodaphone is mudde par bharat sarkaar ko antarrashtriya court main le janaa chaahati thi, lekin baad main samjhaute kii raah par chalane lagi
 This tax liability on Vodafone was created after the purchase of Hong Kong company Hutchison Wampoa
 company dwaara yah kharid 2007 main kii gai thi
 Please tell that the British company Vodafone is accused of evasion of tax of about 11 thousand crores in India and has to pay this tax
 is varsh ke aarambh main vittamantralay ke us prastaav ko kanoonmantri kumaar ne khaarij kar diya tha jisamen samjhaute ke raste ko apnaane kaa aagrah kiya gaya tha
 At that time the Law Ministry had declared it illegal
 kanoonmantralay ke alaava atorni general ne bhi samjhaute ke khilaaf apni salaah di thi or kaha ki vodaphone ko pehle apane dendaree chukaani chahie
 But, the special thing is that soon after Sibal took over, the Attorney General gave a fresh opinion that the agreement with Vodafone is legally rational
 kanoonmantralay ke hami ke baad ab yah maamla cabinet main jayega
 Asked about the change in opinion, Attorney General GE Vahanvati said that no attempt has been made to circumvent the law
 saath hi unhone kaha ki bina sansad kii manjuuri ke kuch bhi kiya nahin ja saktaa he
 The change in agi's opinion is said to have come at a meeting of Finance Minister p Chidambaram in the presence of Revenue Secretary and Chairman of Central Direct Taxes after the clarification in which Chidambaram said that the resolution of the agreement neither violated the law nor It makes any change in tax liability under the Income Tax Act
 chidambaram ne yah bhi kaha tha ki vodaphone ke saath muddon par vichaar karne ke liye cabinet se ijaajat ke liye prastaav rakhaa gaya tha
 Apart from this, the Finance Minister said that an agreement with Vodafone will be done within the scope of the law
 kanoonmantralay kaa kaamkaaj sanbhaalane ke saath hi sibbal ne is baat par jor diya tha ki kanoonee prakriya ko aarthik vruddhi main avarohak kaa kaam nahin karnaa chahie, balki use aage badhaane vaali honi chahie
 The comments bataa den ki britani company ne supreme court main isi kar maamle main cese jeeta tha or usee aadesh kaa asar samaapt karne ke liye kanoon main sanshodhan kiya gaya tha
 After this change, the Income Tax Department had sent a notice to Vodafone saying that the company had to pay tax interest of Rs 11,217 crore
 vahiin, iske jawaab main company ne kaha ki un par bharat sarkaar kii kuch bhi dendaree nahin banati he
 Earlier, Vodafone wanted to take the Indian government to the international court on this issue, but later on the path of compromise
 vodaphone par yah kar dendaree honkong kii company hachisan vampoa ko kharidne ke baad bani thi
 The purchase was made by the company in 2007

 The traffic crawling on the road or the ambulance or fire brigade trapped in it has not come yet, but this time BJP is going to include ndtv's campaign 'right Lane Be Life Lane' in the election manifesto with the intention of winning Delhi
 In order to improve emergency services
 bijepi ke dilli pradesh adhyaksh satish upaadhyaay ne kaha ki agar ham satta main aate hai to jahaan-jahaan mumkin he, ek len banavaai jaaegi
 Also, CCTV cameras will also be installed on the trains of emergency services - such as ambulances, fire brigades - so that action will be taken against those who create obstacles in their way
 saath hi bijepi ke menifesto main bhi is mudde ko shaamil kiya jayega
 This campaign is related to the lives of the needy, so the Aam Aadmi Party, which came to power last time, has also praised the issue and promised to support it
 aam aadmi party ke netaa manish sitaudiya ne kaha ki ham immergency services ko lekar gambhir hai

 When Team India included Ravindra Jadeja, correcting the mistake in the third Test in Melbourne, this leftie bowler once again proved that if there is a little too much for him in the pitch, then the front team should be spared Not difficult, it is impossible! With two wickets in the first innings and then three wickets in the second innings, Jadeja created another problem in front of the Kangaroo batsmen before the remaining test
 rabindra jadeja ne sabit kar diya ki aakhri test main agar aisi pich na bhi mili, to bhi mejabaan ballebaajon ke liye jadeja ko khelnaa aasaan nahin hoga
 Certainly, after the visible defeat, the kangaroo batsmen have difficulties
 Ravindra Jadeja picks his first in the innings, Australia 2 down now
 Mayank Agarwal grabs one at short leg # teamindia # ausvindpic

 com / x2xd8x1e21 While Jadeja dismissed Usman Khawaja and Mitchell Morsch in the first innings, he took his opening three wickets in the second innings of the MCG Test as Marcus Harris, Tim Penny and once again as Mitchell Marsh
 is lefti spinner ne dikhaaya ki unhen sheersh ballebaajon ke wicket lenaa bhi acchhee tarah aata he
 And it cannot be denied that Jadeja also contributed significantly to the thinning of Australia
 jadeja ko or bhi wicket mil sakate the, lekin kam se dam do maukon par wicket ke peeche pant ne unki gendon par kaich choda
 Cricket Poll: Who do you think is the favorite cricketer for the year 2018? However, Ravindra Jadeja surpassed the legendary Indian off-spinner Erapalli spinner by a record first five wickets in both innings of the Melbourne Test
 to vahiin mishael johnson sahit kuch or banyahattha gendbaajon ko bhi peeche chhodte hue jadeja unase aage nikal gaye
 Actually let us tell you that Jadeja has equaled Erapalli Prasanna's 189 wickets
 lekin antar yah he ki jahaan prasanna ne 49 test main 189 wicket chatkaaye the, to vahiin jadeja ne is kaam ko sirf 40 test main anjaam de daalaa
 Meaning Jadeja beat Prasanna by a margin of nine Tests in a way
 yah karnama karne ke saath hi 40 test ke baad jadeja ne duniya ke baaki leftorm boleron ko bhi apane viketon kii sankhya se kaaphi peeche chhod diya
 Let us know how many wickets a bowler had after forty Test matches
 ummid he ki jadeja ke karnaamon kaa silsilaa yaheen hi khatm hone nahin ja rahaa
 And as Jadeja will play further matches, he will add many more records with the ball

 Dengue and chikungunya wreak havoc in the capital
 dengue kii dehshat kaa alam ye hai ki dilli ke aspataal tak dengue or chikangunia ke virus se trast hai
 Recently, around 22 cases of dengue and chikungunya and in-place breeding were revealed to the hospital staff in the complex of hospitals like Delhi's three major hospitals, Maulana Azad Medical College, LNJP Hospital and GB Pant, in view of which the MCD has shifted its facilities to these hospitals
 Fogging and anti-larval activities have intensified
 aspataalon main logon kaa aana-janaa bahut zyada hota hai, aise main agar aspataal complex main hi breeding milegi to marijon kii sankhya kahaan se kahaan tak pahunch sakati he
 Therefore, the MCD has shown quickness in fogging and chemical spraying in hospitals when there are cases of rapidly spreading dengue-chikungunya among hospital staff and patients
 emsidi piarpo kaa kahana he khospatalmen marijon ke saath aane vaale logon kii vajah se kaaphi sankraman baahar jaataa he
 And the number of cases in hospitals is due to the increasing number of patients
 lekin sawaal ye hai ki aakhir maamle badhane ke baad hi emsidi furti kyon dikhaati hai? aspataalon main breeding or sankraman panpane ke asaar laazmi hai, lekin phir bhi emsidi ne hospital staff se maamla aane ke baad hi kavayad shuru kii
 The ever increasing deaths from dengue-chikungunya in the capital are the result of negligence of agencies somewhere

 in saaton sectoron par padi jabardast mandi kii maar ke kaaran ye chantni kerani pad rahi he or aisa nahin karne par in sectoron kii companiyon ke liye bazaar main tike rah paanaa sambhav nahin hoga
 Assocham Chairman Sajjan Jindal said that the HR department of these sectors has been asked to work towards retrenchment and it will be announced in the next 10 days or so
 asocham kaa kahana he ki in saaton sectors main machi afra-tafari or ab in companiyon kaa baari laagat-upayon kaa faisla liye jane ke baad bhartiya rigerv bank (arabiai) par dabaav banegaa
 Assocham wants the RBI to reduce the interest rate by at least 3 percent, so that money comes in the market and the industry can get loans at a cheaper rate

 com / wxwpzb4utm Much was learned about the personal life and struggle of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 masalan ve chaay bechate the, dusron ke kapade dhote the, technosevi hai, ve rashtriya swayamsevak sangh kii vichaardhaara ko jeene vaale hai
 His mother worked in the homes of others to meet household expenses
 
 Et cetera
 
 Et cetera
 in chunaavon ke dauraan is baat se bhi pardaa uthaa ki ve shaadi-shuda hai
 Apart from this, for those who want to know about many other aspects of their life, the book published by Prabhat Prakashan, Makwanaki book, Commonman Narendra Modi, will prove very useful
 kishor makvana peshey se patrkaar hai
 Many of his books have come on the market
 itnaa hi nahin panyajnya nachiketa sammaan sahit kai anya puraskaron se bhi ve navaaje gaye hai
 People do not know Modi as a writer, poet, playwright
 jabaki modi ye sab hai
 Modi has also staged drama in school as a child
 iske alaava unhone koun se naatak or kitaab likhi, ye sab jaanane ke liye kitaab ke panne palatney honge
 In this book, Makwana has written the story of Narendra Modi's life struggle in detail
 kattar hindu hone ke aaropon ko nakaarti hui yah pustak modi kii uplabdhiyon ko ginaakar pesh karti he
 Referring to Modi's achievements, it has been said that 'does the water transported to Kutch alone drink and irrigate, are the Muslim families living nearby not benefiting from it
 ' aise kai udhaaharan yah pustak ginaati he
 The book claims that Modi, rather than a staunch Hindu, is the father of all Gujarati hindu-muslims living in Gujarat
 modi kii netritv kshamta (leadership quality)kitaab khulaasa karti he ki modi ne netritv kshamta kaa parichay bachapan main hi de diya tha
 There were many occasions when he led successfully
 kitaab main likhaa he ki jab ve hiskool main the tab unhone apane vipakshi ummidavaar ko apane kaushal se haraa diya tha
 Another example of his organization skills was seen when, in his one-year effort, Modi won Gujarat's largest metropolitan municipality in Gujarat
 gujarat ke mukhyamantri pad kii shapath lene ke chaar maheene baad godhra cond hua
 Assembly elections were held 10 months after the Godhra incident
 apni kaaryakshmata se logon ko prabhavit kar or netritv kshamta kaa parichay dekar unhone party ko jeet kaa tohfa diya
 Today Modi is the Prime Minister of the country because of this style of work and leadership ability
 modi kii is kaarykushalta ke bare main yah kitaab vistaar se khulaasa karti he
 At the same time, Modi's early life tells the struggles till becoming a prime ministerial candidate, highlighting the mess and ups and downs of life
 kitaab kii bhashaa saral he
 The book has relevance that keeps the reader hooked
 aalochanakitab kyonki modi ke jivan par he to ummid kii ja sakati thi ki jis tarah mata-pita, sangh ke judaav kaa zikr he vaisaa hi patni ke bare main kuch khulaasa hoga, lekin iskaa zikr kitaab main nahin he
 Apart from this, every person has two aspects of life, positive and negative
 lekin kitaab modi ke nakaaratmak pahalu kaa kahin zikr nahin karti he
 For this reason, it would not be an exaggeration to call this book 'modinama'
 kai baar to padhate-padhate aisa maaloom hota he ki jaise kahin die gaye bhaashan ko puraa kaa puraa chhap diya gaya ho
 When you read more than half of the book, the propaganda booklet of the Gujarat government, you do not mention the achievements that come in between
 lekin jab aap kitaab main ‘vikaas ke sau kadam’ adhyay ko padhate hai to aisa mahasoos hota he ki ye gujarat sarkaar ke prachaar-prasar kii pustika he
 Modi's lovely hymn 'vaishnav jana to you

 Apart from this, how many languages does Modi know, which Bollywood songs he likes to read, please read this book of Kishore Makwana
 is aadhunik daur main bhi mahilaayein bhedbhaav or aparaadh jhelane ko majaboor hai, tis par unamem kanoonee jaagrukta kaa abhaav unhen or shoshit bana detaa he
 In such a situation, the importance of a legal advice book like your friend increases, that too when the writer is not only a judge but a woman
 yahi vajah he ki dilli main sibiai adaalat main atirikt jila evam satr nyaayadhish swarna kanta sharma ne behad samvedansheeltaa ke saath mahilaon ke khilaaf hone vaale bhedbhaav or aparaadh se jude vibhinn kanoonon ko chuaa he
 This book tells about all such laws which are related to the life of a woman, from adolescence to old age
 kitaab do bhaagon main banty he
 In the first part, the writer presents his perspective on love, economic matters and women empowerment
 unki sabase ahm raay yah jaan padati he ki mahilaon ke liye aarthik aazaadee behad jaruri he
 In the second part, the author discusses special laws of women such as dowry related laws to the rights of working women

 Religion section provides information about inter-religious marriage, conversion, Hindu marriage to Muslim, Christian, Zoroastrian and Special Marriage Act
 vibhinn dharmon main talaak ke tareekon or kanoon ke bare main jaananaa bhi kam dilachasp nahin
 Apart from these, advice ranging from registering firs in sexual offenses to handling trauma, or acid attack or free legal advice to the needy and information about compensation, the author has shown sensitivity by presenting them
 sibar aparaadhon se bachane ko lekar mashvira unke aaj ke daur ke vijan ko bhi saamne laata he
 However, the biggest feature of the book is that complex laws are also explained in a simple and easy way

 Chief Congress Spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said, "apart from this, it raises a legitimate concern whether this is not an attempt by the Modi government to divert the attention of the country from political and economic challenges and the widespread agrarian distress across the country?" unhone kaha, 'may, 2014 ke baad se kadam nirantar kabhi aage to kabhi peeche kiye gaye jo bangkok main enese baithak ko lekar koi utsaah nahin paidaa karte hai

 darasal, ek tivi intervyuu ke dauraan piem modi ne kaha tha ki air strike ke din mausam thik nahin tha
 Experts believed that day to strike on the second day

 In the letter written to the Chief Election Commissioner Sunil Arora regarding this statement, Sitaram Yechury has said that in the interview, PM Modi has given details of the operation of the sensitive military mission
 iskaa uddeshy chunaav main matadaataaon ko prabhavit karnaa he

 yechuri ne kaha ki aisa lag rahaa he ki modi chunaav kaa makhul uda rahe hai
 During the election, the PM is keeping all the rules and guidelines under control

 In such a situation, we hope that action will be taken against them while maintaining the credibility of the election
 seetaram yechuri kaa kahana he, 'niyamon ke ulanghan ke aise hi maamle pehle bhi saamne laae gaye hai
 However, the Election Commission thinks that PM Narendra Modi and Amit Shah are above the electoral process and the model code of conduct does not apply to them
 cartoonist, akhbaar ke sampadakeey or tippaneekaron ke jariye is baat kaa notice kiya gaya he
 i hope that the Election Commission will act on PM Modi and prove him (cartoonist, editorial and commentator) wrong

 i have always learned this and believed that when the new generation comes forward, some changes start to be felt automatically
 ghar se lekar kisi bhi kshetra main yah baat lagu hoti he
 How can this natural law be different for the music world
 khaas taur par jab main filmi sangeet kii duniya ko dekhati hum to mujhe sabase bada fark mahasoos hota he
 In our times, singers were not afraid of losing anything and we respected musicians like God
 is nai peedi ke gayakon main yah dar jarur rahata he ki kahin unka gaanaa kisi or ko na mil jaae
 i would also like to say that this fear also gives them a way to move forward because they work very hard to make their song firm
 aisa nahin ki pehle ke gayakon main mehnat kii koi kami hua karti thi
 But the way our generation has enlisted its songs, it is definitely felt in this generation
 haalanki pratibha main ve kisi se kam nahin
 Among the new singers, i am very impressed with Mohit Chauhan and Javed Ali
 donon kii aawaaj main bahut dam he or donon har tarah ke gaanon ko bahut acchhee tarah se gaate hai
 There is variety in his voice
 mohit kii aawaaj ko masti vaale gane zyada jamate hai
 Javed sings emotional songs from the heart and binds the crowd
 nai gayikaon main shweta pandit or shivani bahut acha gaati hai
 But if i do not consider Shreya Ghoshal and Sunidhi Chauhan very senior, then i would like to say that there is still no one to match them
 shreya or sunidhi nae daur kii pasand par har tarah se khari utari hai
 i have no doubt that she will maintain her singing for a very long time
 haa, kailash kher ke liye khaas taur par ek baat kangi ki unki sufi gayikee bahut kamaal kii he
 But my own personal opinion is that he should not hurry to become a musician
 unako gayikee par zyada dhyaan dena chahie, taaki or achche se achche gane unako milen
 i can feel Kher's struggle and his ability
 raahat ali sahab ke liye kuch kahana mere liye chota munh badi baat hogi
 i do not do politics
 magar unke gane sangeet kii duniya ke liye kisi tohfe se kam nahin hai
 i remember an era when business was not everything in our music
 kitni baar aisa hota tha ki hamaare naam kii sifarish vahi gayika karti thi, jise gane ke liye bulaayaa gaya
 Musicians used to tell us this very well and almost everyone did it
 kabhi mujhe laga ki yah gaanaa kavita ji (krishnamurthi) behatar ga sakati hai, to maine unke naam ko aage badhaayaa, kabhi unhone yaa kisi or singer ne mere naam ko aage badhaayaa
 Such things are no longer heard in this new generation
 sab kuch profeshnal hota ja rahaa he
 It takes market, price and success into consideration
 par suron kii duniya in baton se aage hoti he or rahegi
 The new generation should understand the importance of the competition, also remember that more music is given importance than competition

 This exemption has been implemented since March last year
 dilli sarkaar ke mutabik dilli ke 18 lakh pariwaron ko free pani kaa phayda milegaa

 baat bas itani hui ki ant main manch khaali dekh unhone ek-do photuein khinchaai or fasebuk par ye kahkar daal di ki unhone hi lacture diya he
 Even though everything was going well, but Harvard people were sitting so cold that Lalu daughter started sending and sending mails to listen only and not to listen
 kise fark padataa he wo harvard kennedy skool gayi thi yaa haridwar kalanidhi public skool par harvard waalon ne jaraa si baat ko itnaa bada bana daalaa bina yah jane ki manushya khaas taur par ham bhartiya bade photogenic praani hai

 1
 photose selfi lenaa hamaara janmasiddh adhikaar he
 We can take selfies anywhere, in office bathrooms, eating matka kulfi, at weddings, in bars or at one's will
 2
 What we hate the most is cropping it with a group photo
 3
 The one we love the most is also cropped with photos
 paariwarik kaarnon se har crocked photo ke peeche ek garlfriend yaa boyfriend hota he
 4
 khud ham chaahe kitne bhi kukarm karen, chachaa ji ke bete ne ganne kii dukaan par bhi khadey hokar photo khinchaai ho to use 'pine laga he
 
 lagata he' kahkar ghar waalon ko dikhaane se baj nahin aate
 5
 nai car par ham yun tikkar photo khinchaate hai, jaise papa ne berthde par hi gift kii he
 Even if we do not know the name of its owner or the model
 6
 We only tolerate a friend because he has a DSLR
 7
 No matter how many poses we give, Aadhaar card, voter id card and family photos never get good photo
 family photo main to har koi jan-gana-man kii mudra main najar aata he
 8
 ghar par koi nai cheez aae ham uski photo khinche bina nahin maanate, phir bhale wo bhaap chhodane vaali istre hi kyon na hon
 9
 bhale ek vaqt ke baad lagane lage ki photose ke maamle main aap piechdi kar chuke hai
 This confusion breaks when a photo of a chin is sent to the chin for marriage

 Flyovers, malls, waterfalls, benches in front of the Taj Mahal, temple steps and the last seats of the class are the most visible photos in the photos

 Banjara said that some people are conspiring against Hinduism by staying behind the head of the law

 Trying to support Asaram, IG Vanzara may not have been allowed to meet Asaram but outside the jail, Banjara once again spoke of supporting Asaram and conspiring against him, he once again gave rise to the debate that Banjara wants to get into politics and uses her own radical Hinduist image for this

 dilli metro kii kalindi kunj depo main shuukravaar ko do metro trainon ke aapas main takaraane ko bhale hi dmarsi choti ghatana qaraar de rahi ho, lekin sutron kii maane to dmarsi ne is ghatana ko lekar train kamishning ke kaam main lagi train nirmaataa company ke saamne kadi aapatti jataai he or apni jaanch shuru kar di he
 The plan to land the metro on the track without a driver is being considered a major setback due to this incident
 dotrenonke aapas main takaraane kii tasviren media main saamne aane ke baad dilli metro ne jo bayaan jari kiya tha, usamen kaha tha ki ye koi badi ghatana nahin he or kamishning kar rahi company rotem ke staff kii laaparvaahee se ye haadasa hua tha
 But this incident has created panic within DMRC
 kyonki ye tisare phej kii magenta line ke liye laai gai wo train he, jinhen driverles takanic se banaaya gaya he or dilli metro inhen bina driver ke hi trek par utaarne kii yojana bana rahi thi
 But after the accident during the trial run on the Janakpuri Botanical Garden line, the efforts of the ABMRC are being considered a tremendous blow
 trial ran shuru karte vakt dmarsi ke emdi mongu singh ne kaha tha ki unhen metro ke musafiron ko driverles train main safar ke liye maansik taur par taiyaar karnaa hoga or aisa metro kii technology par bharose ke jariye hi ho saktaa he, lekin is ghatana ke baad khud dmarsi keijineerska bharosa buree tarah se hill gaya he
 In such a situation, the plan to run a driverless train may be in trouble
 haalanki dmarsi kaa kahana he ki wo pehle ek do saal tak driver ke saath hi in trainon ko chalaane vaali thi, baavjood iske ki ye train bina driver ke bhi automatic system se chalaai ja sakati he
 At present, DMRC has started internal investigation for driverless train accident and also said that the train running in commercial operation is run through ATP (automatic Train Protection) and ATO (automatic Train Operation), in which two trains have the same track But there is no possibility of this happening and at the same time there remains a definite difference between the two trains
 somvaar ko hone vaali board kii meeting main bhi is haadase ke baad kii paristhitiyon par charchaa ho sakati he or iske baad jaanch kaa dayera bhi badhaaya ja saktaa he
 An American organization that monitors corruption has said that the US allowed Pakistan to build and acquire nuclear weapons by keeping Congress in the dark
 sanstha ne yah jaankaree aise adhikari ke hawaale se di he jise is niti par aapatti karne kii vajah se barkhaast kar diya gaya tha
 The organization said that when the CIA and Pentagon official objected to the then US administration's policy of keeping Congress in the dark, it was removed from the road
 america sanstha ne kiya bhandafodproject aan government oversite (pogo)kii kaaryakari nideshak danniel bryan ne pichley saptaah congress kii sunwaayee main kaha siie ke khufia adhikari rich barlo ko is baat kii jaankaree mil gai thi ki america ke ucchadhikari pakistan ko parmaanu hathiyaar nirmaan or unhen rakhane kii anumati de rahe hai
 Barlow later also served as Pentagon official
 washington aadhaarit pogo gairlabhakaari sanstha he jo bhrashtachar ke khilaaf abhiyaan chhedane vaale logon or sarkaar ke andruni logon ke saath bhrashtachar dhokhadhadi or satta ke durupyog rokane par kaam karti he
 Brian told mps that Barlow also learned that officials had hidden this fact from Congress
 barlo ne is par aapatti jataai or apane ucchadhikariyon ko kaha ki congress ko isaki jaankaree deni chahie
 On doing so, he was fired
 america sarkaar main bhrashtachar ke virodh main kaam karne vaale kai logon ke bhavishya ke udhaaharan dete hue bryan ne bataaya barlo ab deen hin or niraashrith avasthaa main rah rahe hai
 a report published in the newspaper earlier in 2007, in a report published in Britain's The Guardian, said that during the investigation of WMD smugglers in the late 80s, Barlow found out that it was linked to Pakistan
 akhbaar ke anusaar barlo ko jald hi pataa chal gaya tha ki sarkaar ke ucchadhikari america or antarrashtriya parmaanu aprasar niyam ko todate hue pakistan kii mahatvakakshaanon ko puraa kar rahe hai
 Even selling him restricted WMD technology
 report ke anusaar barlo ko yah bhi pataa chalaa ki pentagon pakistan ko jet fiter bechney ja rahaa he jo parmaanu bam giraane ke kaam main liya ja saktaa he
 Barlow came to the conclusion that a group of senior officials were supporting Pakistan's program
 akhbaar main kaha gaya he barlo ne dick cheni ke liye ek sankshipt report banaai jo us samay pentagon main the lekin unke khilaaf shadyantr ho gaya or unhen alag kar diya gaya

 The first aspect of the coin was seen in some pictures printed in the newspapers of 25 June
 is chitra se judi sukhad ghatana bharat se lagbhag saadhe teen hajaar kilometre dur us saudi arab main ghati thi,jo islam kii janmabhumi rahi he,or jahaan islam kii do sabase pavitra masjid al haram or madina sthit hai
 It is also worth noting here that the palace became the source of this historical and revolutionary event, when Prince Muhammad bin Salman issued an order allowing women of his country to drive
 subah ke akhabaaron kii ye tasviren dhoop se jhulaste chehron par pani kii phuhaaren banakar use tarbatar kar gayi
 Saudi Arabia is a Sunni Muslim-dominated country with a population of only 30 million
 saath hi yah islamic jagat kaa bhi ek mahatvapurn mulk he
 In such a situation, the impact of this Saudi incident especially on Sunni Muslims of South Asia is bound to fall
 bharat ke bhi lagbhag19karod muslimon main sunni bahusankhya main hai
 The number of Shias is quite small
 saath hi bharat ke lagbhag50lakh log saudi arab main kaam kar rahe hai,jinhen'bharat kaa sandeshvahak'kaha ja saktaa he,phir chaahe ve kisi bhi dharm ke kyon na hon
 So can it be expected that this air of liberal ideas coming out of Saudi's window will make Hindustan happy by traveling 3,500 kilometers

 Both these declarations have been parallel, but their directions are not the same, so, maybe, their conclusions can go ahead and turn into a confrontation
 yahaan sochane kii baat yah he ki yadi aisa hota he,to phir kya hoga
 
 
 There is no doubt that the Islamic society of India is a relatively open society
 din-pratidin usamen,visheshkar uske mahila varg main,udaaravaadi loktantric vichaar saans lene lage hai
 As a proof of this, it would not be wrong to present the 'ishq Subhan Alla' serial on the TV channel
 mujhe lagata he ki is dharawahik kaa antim nishkarsh,jiske sukhad hone kii sambhaavna adhik he,in donon ke takaraav kaa antim parinaam hoga
 In this way, no matter what the society is, its windows will open and must be opened
