 hindustani shastreey sangeet ke ek yug kaa avsaan ho gaya, parantu is yug ke purodha bharataratna pandit bhimsen joshi jane se pehle suron ko us oonchai par pahunchaa gaye hai ki yugon-yugon tak ye swar hawaaon main tairte rahenge
 
 
 Panditji is one of the greatest artists who has not only classical singing, light classical music, devotional music and other diversified music which has penetrated deep into the hearts of the listeners with his melodious voice both in joy and sadness
 Also left an indelible mark, although he represented a grocery house
 
 
 pandit ji ko sarvaadhik lokapriy hindustani shastreey gayak banane main nirvivaad rup se unki damdaar aawaaj kii ahm bhoomika rahi
 
 
 The confluence of tact and passion gave Joshi ji a place apart from other classical singers who remained attached to their gharana culture, which could hinder their creativity
 
 
 4 farvari, 1922 ko karnataka ke dharwar jile ke gadag main janme joshi ko bachapan se hi sangeet se lagaav tha
 
 
 He left home at the age of 11 to search for a guru for the purpose of learning music
 
 
 vaise jab vah ghar par the, tab bhi khilne kii umr main vah apane dada kaa tanpura bajaane lage the
 
 
 His craze for music was that he used to run out of the house even after hearing the sound of the bhajan mandali passing through the street or the azaan coming from the nearby mosque
 
 
 guru kii talash ke liye joshi ji ne ghar choda or gadag railway stesan chal pade
 
 
 Clad in a twisted shirt and halfpant, Pandit ji boarded the train without taking a ticket and reached Bijapur, where he started singing bhajans for livelihood
 
 
 isi dauraan ek sangeet premi ne unhen gwalior jane kii salaah di
 
 
 He considered Salaih, but due to some confusion about the train, he reached Maharashtra's rich city of Pune
 
 
 vahaan unhone prakhyat shastreey gayak krishnarav phulambarikar se sangeet sikhaane kaa anurodh kiya, lekin phulambarikar ne masik fees kii maang kii, jise dena us ladke ke liye sambhav nahin tha, jiske laapata hone par abhibhavak gadag police thane main shikaayat darj kara chuke the
 
 
 Joshi was disappointed, but his morale did not break, and he moved from Pune to Mumbai
 
 
 vahaan se antat guru kii talash unhen hindustani sangeet ke centre gwalior le gai, jo unka vaastavik gantavy tha
 
 
 With the help of Sarod Ustad Hafiz Ali Khan, who was under the patronage of Maharaja of Gwalior, the young Joshi entered Madhav Sangeet Vidyalaya, which was a pioneer music institution in those days
 
 
 gayaki ke takneekee pahaluon ko sikhte hue joshi ne khyaal kii baarikiyon ko aatmsaat kiya
 
 
 Khyal singing is considered to be the gift of the Gwalior family
 
 
 pandit joshi ne tansen ke jivan par aadhaarit ek bangla film main ek dhrupad gayak ke taur par apni aawaaj di or uske baad marathi film gulaacha ganpati ke liye bhi apni gayan pratibha pradarshit kii
 
 
 He also spread the magic of his voice in Hindi films - Basant Bahar and Bhairavi
 
 
 pandit ji kii sant vaani or marathi bhakthi sangeet ke prabhaav ke chalate unki aawaaj maharashtra or karnataka ke ghar-ghar main pahunchi
 
 
 He was honored with the Padma Shri in 1972, the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award for Hindustani Classical Music in 1975, the Padma Bhushan in 1985 and the Tansen Samman of the Government of Madhya Pradesh in 1992, and was conferred with Bharataratna in 2008
 
 
 pandit joshi kaa 1999 main brain tumor kaa oparation or 2005 main cervical spine kaa oparation hua tha
 
 
 Pandit ji overwhelmed the public with his public performance at the Sawai Gandharva Annual Music Festival in the year 2007, which he started in memory of his mentor

 argedy supremeo lalu prasad yadav se hari jhandi milane ke baadaparty ne ravivaar ko rajyasabhaki 2 siton ke liye party pravaktaa manoj jha or bijnesaman ashfak kareem kaa naam ghoshit kiya
 RJD state president Ramchandra Purave announced both these names on Sunday
 gauratlab he ki pichley kuch dinon se argedy kii taraf se rajyasabha ke do naamon ko lekar kaaphi charchaa ho rahi thi jisane party ke varisht netaa raghuvansh prasad singh, shivanand tiwari or jagadanand singh kaa naam shaamil he magar in sabhi ko darkinar karte hue lalu prasad ne nae chehron ko tarjeeh di he

 On the other hand, JDU has re-fielded the old faces by not choosing new faces for the 2 seats in its quota
 inamen jediu pradesh adhyaksh vashishtha narayan singh or king mahendra shaamil hai
 The Rajya Sabha membership of both is scheduled to expire next month
 bijepi ne pehle se hi apane 1 rajyasabha seat ke liye kendriya mantri ravishankar prasad kaa naam ghoshit kar diya he
 These five candidates will file their nominations on Monday
 bataa den ki bihar se 6 rajyasabha siton ke liye chunaav hona he jinamein sejediuke 2, argedy ke 2 or bijepi ke ek ummidavaar jinka naam ghoshit kar diya gaya he inkaa chunaa janaa tay he
 The matter seems to be stuck with the sixth seat

 The Congress has not yet announced the name of its candidate

 vartmaan loksabhaa chunaav main narendra modi ke paksh main mili baari janadesh ne bhartiya chunavi itihaas main ek nayaa adhyay jod diya he
 This victory for Narendra Modi created many records
 bhaajapa na keval 35 varshon main purna bahumat ke saath satta main lautne vaali pehali party ban gai, balki prachand jeet ke saath uske vot share main bhi record vruddhi darj kii gai
 These results, apart from reflecting Modi's popularity, also reflect the bjp's steady expansion over the years
 bhartiya janata party ne akele is chunaav main 303 siten jeetin jo ki 2014 ke mukaable 21 adhik hai
 More importantly, the saffron party increased its vote share by 6 percent
 yah is myne main aitihaasik he ki bhartiya chunavi itihaas main 1952 ke baad koi bhi dal is raftaar se apane vot share main vruddhi nahin kar sakaa he
 The previous record was held by the Congress which had registered a 5 percent increase in vote share in 1984
 haalanki, 1984 ke chunaav indira gandhi kii hatya kii prishthbhumi main hue the or congress sahanubhuti ke rup main mili voton par savaar thi
 Prior to 1984, it was seen twice when a party increased its vote share
 pehali baar 1957 main jawaharlal nehru ke netritv main or duusari baar 1971 main indira gandhi ke netritv main
 However, both times Congress votes increased and both times the vote share increase was 3 percent
 yah dhyaan rakhana mahatvapurn he ki bhartiya raajnneeti kii is avadhi main congress kaa prabhutv tha
 But now the time has changed and the oldest party is now a shadow of its former form
 bharat ke chunavi itihaas main pehali baar 2014 main, bhaajapa kaa vot share congress se adhik rahaa
 Although the bjp-led NDA managed to form the government at the Center in 1998 and 1999, its vote share was lower than the Congress
 bhaajapa ke liye vot share main vruddhi koi nai baat nahin he kyonki isse pehle bhi 3 maukey aise aae jab bhagava party ne anya partiyon ke samarthan se vot share ke maamle main chalaang lagaai
 In 1991, BJP votes were seen to increase by 9 per cent when Mandal was at the peak of politics, when they rose from 11 per cent to 20 per cent
 duusari baar 1998 main use 6 fisadi zyada vot mili the or 2014 main uske vot share main 12 fisadi kaa ijapha hua tha
 However, a 6 percent increase in votes is more important for the BJP in this election as it is not only the highest increase for any single party, but also because the BJP is tremendous with the lead in states like West Bengal and Odisha
 It also managed to create political vicissitudes, where until recently it was counted as the weakest parties

 madad maangate rahe par jab puraa ilaaka hi samandar ban jaae to madadgaar kahaan se pahonchega?jo kal tak chamoli jile kaa ek khushhaal ilaaka hua karata tha, uske ab chaaron taraf pani hi pani
 There are only a few abandoned houses left as a token
 tasviren gavaah hai ki puraa ilaaka malbe main tabdeel ho chukaa he
 Now the question arises that what happened to the people of the area? So the news at the moment is that thousands of people are missing
 kahaan hai kis haal me hai
 Do not know
 par tabaahi kii ye khaufnak tasviir sabko ek hi dar se daraa rahi he
 After the angry waves stop and the debris is removed
 qayaamat sirf chand minute kii thi
 But it will take years for Uttarakhand to overcome that doom
 ek-ek basti ko basaane or sanvaarane main sadiyaan lag jaati hai
 But a few minutes of desolation gussaye badal main lipat kar ai tamtmaai laharon ne uttarakhand ke kai jilon or bastiyon ke naamo-nishaan tak mitaa die hai
 Entire life goes into making a shelter
 to jaraa sochie ki puri basti basaane main kitna vakt laga hoga? basti kaise or kitni muddat main basati he ye to nahin dikhaa
 But how can a whole colony be ruined and in how long it can be destroyed, how can it destroy the settlement of this colony
 nadi kii khaufnak lehren apane saath koi kachra nahin, balki puri kii puri basati ko ukhaad kar le gai
 For centuries, when nature changed its face, it left such traces of destruction that wiped out human and human settlements in an instant
 kudarat ke kahar ne kai kai baar anginat zindagiyon ko hameshaa ke liye khamosh kar diya
 Innocent and innocent nature seemed helpless and helpless in front of the havoc
 kudarat har baar bedadak kahar barpati rahi or insaan ujadte rahi
 Because on the strength of nature, human law simply does not work
 maaf kijiega, lekin agar kudarat bhi kahin insaani kanoon kii zad main aata or insaanon ke liye kudarat ko sazaa de paanaa mumkin hota to naa maaloom use ab tak kitni baar sajaa-e-maut mil chuki hoti
 Till yesterday, the four-storey building on the banks of the Ganges in Uttarkashi was inhabited by humans
 puraa kaa puraa kunba palata tha
 But on the morning of 16 June, Ganga took the form of a monstrous form that the house collapsed like playing cards
 wo to bhala ho, uttarkashi prashasan or aas-paas ke logon kaa, jinaki badaulat is imaarat main rahanevaale logon ko haadase se pehle hi baahar nikaal liya gaya
 This is about seven o'clock in the morning of 16 June
 ganga kii lehren lagaataar is imaarat kii buniyaad ko kamazor kar rahi thi
 The people living here may have already evacuated this house
 lekin jindagi bhar tinkaa-tinkaa jod kar is makaan ko banaanevaale or yahaan rahanevaale bebasii se apni jamaapunji par najar jamaaye hue the
 But eventually that time also came, which everyone feared
 pehle is makaan kaa ek chota sa hissaa ganga kii tej thapedo kaa shikaar ban kar tut gaya or phir agle hi pal dekhte hi dekhte puri imaarat dharaashai hokar ganga main samaa gai
 Who would get stressed in the face of this anger of nature? so, sabhi bas tamashbin bane tabaahi kaa ye manjar dekhte rahe
 But the rage and Ganga's anger was yet to come
 aasmaan se buundon kii shakl main tabaahi neeche utarati rahi or ganga har guzarate lamhe ke saath vikaraal hoti gai
 There was a time when the walls of this temple on Assighat started becoming weak due to water slaps
 pujari or bhakton ne jab mandir se duuri banaain to phir bhala bhagwaan ko kaise choda jaataa
 Therefore, the idol of Lord Shankar installed in this temple was also removed and the very next moment the small waves took this small temple
 ufanti nadiyon or in nadiyon ke saath bah kar chattaanon ne gadiyon kaa wo haal kiya he, jise dekh kar yahaan machi tabaahi kaa andaja lagaaya ja saktaa he
 In many places, a sudden flood during relief took the JCB machines and trucks as well
 ye haalat uttarakhand ke mahaz kisi ek ilaake main nahin rahi
 No one currently has any data on how many vehicles have been booked or destroyed in the entire state so far
 lekin ek andaaje ke mutabik ab tak 300 se zyada chaar pahiyaa or usase badi gaadiyaan bah chuki hai
 Human beings are yet to be counted
 sajeesh aasamaani thi afat jameen ne jheli
 There was a fight between the clouds
 tabaahi zamin ko jhelni padi
 Anger burst into the sky above
 sailaab neeche jameen par aayaa
 The havoc of nature has done its work basti kii basti barbaad ho chuki
 Now if anything is left, just a scene of ruin wo manjar jisamen insaan or bhagwaan sab ek se dikh rahe hai
 In the Kali Yuga, the idol of Lord Shankar is now seen sinking in front of the fierce velocity of the same Ganga, the Lord Shankar, who once kept Gangaji in his jatas
 pichley 50 ghanton se bhi zyada vakt se uttarakhand or himachal samet himalay kii tarai main chal rahi bhayanak barish ne naa sirf insaan kii zindagi muhaal kar di he, balki lag rahaa he ki ganga rishikesh main insaanon kii banaai is murti ko bhi apane saath bahaakar le janaa chaahati he
 But the anger of these rivers like Ganga, Bhagirathi, Alaknanda, Patal Ganga and Pinder did not become so angry on humans
 balki iske peeche ek aisi aasamaani sajeesh rahi, jisane in nadiyon ko apane sahilon se aage bad kar bahane ko majaboor kar diya
 According to experts, the monsoon made its first knock in India on 16 June, but the monsoon winds over the Himalayas had reached a day earlier i

 The result of this collision was that the cloud was not one, but in many places, the water flow came from the sky, which turned the river, the paths and the population into rivers
 
 
 himachal pradesh ke kinnaur main lagaataar ho rahi bhayanak barish kaa nateeja ye hua ki isamen funs kar 8 log apni jaan se haath dho baithe, jabaki aas-paas ke pahari ilaakon main mausam kaa lutf uthaane pahunche 15 sau se zyada sailaani jahaan the, vahiin funs gaye
 Areas such as Uttarkashi, Joshimath, Chamoli, Pithoragarh, Tehri, Rudraprayag, and Pauri in Uttarakhand do not know how many routes, how many bridges, how many trains were swept away and how many houses were demolished
 or to or raahat ke kaam main lagaai gai jesibi mashine, trek or duusari gaadiyaan bhi laharon main samaa gai
 In Hemkund Sahib alone, 200 bikes and 80 different vehicles became victims of the sweltering Alaknanda River
 barish ke saath-saath rah rah kar jameen dhansane se bhi afat or badi
 Roads disappeared in many places on the way to Badrinath and Kedarnath, making it difficult to understand that people and vehicles would also pass through these places
 ab haalat ye he ki sarkaar ne itibi se lekar sena tak sabhi se madad maangi hai or jagah-jagah logon ko nikaalane ke saath-saath sadakon ko phir se chalane laayak banane kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 But no one can tell when the situation will be normal
 ise kehete hai musiibat kaa badal fat padana
 In the Chamoli and Dhanaulti, where there was beauty and peace, there is panic spread today
 maut banakar barase pani ne raahat ke tamaam raste band kar die or vahaan pahunche sailaani jahaan-tahaan fanse hue hai
 Alaknanda has so much water at Govindghat in Chamoli district that the river is flowing at full speed thundering
 yahaan bhuskhalan kii vajah se rasta band ho gaya or badi taadaad main yatri yahaan funs gaye
 Joshimath is 18 km from here
 tirthayatriyon ko paidal hi joshimath kii ore ravaanaa kar diya gaya
 In Chamoli, Uttarkashi, Kedarnath, Badrinath, Tehri, Rudraprayag, Pauri, Dehradun, Pithoragarh and Nainital districts, many areas are facing heavy rains
 halaat is kadar bighad gaye hai ki 200 se zyada do pahiyaa vaahan or 80 ke kareeb duusari choti badi gaadiyaan dekhte dekhte alaknanda kii dhara main samaa gayi
 a bridge, 5 hotels and even a helicopter swept into the river
 hemkund parvat ghati main 5 hazaar se zyada yatriyon kii jaan par ban ai he
 Electricity and telephone services have been devastated
 udhar, musuri ke upar dhanolti main badal fatne se lagbhag 400 sailaani funs gaye hai
 It is difficult to say who is where and how they are
 jo log hemkund sahib kii yatra par ja rahe the yaa vahaan se laut rahe the, unhen samaj nahin aa rahaa he ki kab is musiibat se nikal paaenge, kyonki daraane vaala manjar unhone apni ankhon se dekha
 a temple in Uttarkashi perished in a stormy storm
 yahaan ganga kii dhara baukhalaai hui he, jo kuch uske raste main aata he use mitaa dene par amada he
 a 4-storey building has already collapsed here
 or barish he ki thamane kaa naam nahin le rahi
 In this hour of trouble, the army has jumped into relief and rescue work
 sena ne uttarkashi, joshimath, rudraprayag, govindghat, hanumanchetty or dharchula main apane shivi lagaae hai jahaan yatriyon ke khaane, pine or ilaaj kii jaruratein puri karne kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 The army has provided helpline numbers to help stranded passengers

 By contacting these numbers, army help can be obtained

 financial express kii khabar he ki mangalvaar ko grahamantri amit shah kii adhyakshata main mantriyon ke samooh kii baithak hui thi
 It considered measures to bring public sector companies like BSNL and MTNL back on track
 ab spectrum bechakar paisa kamaane ke sarkaar ke din lad gaye hai
 Now its chances are very weak that the government will be able to fill the treasury by selling telecom spectrum at a higher price
 sarkaar ke saamne yah sawaal he ki kya in companiyon main paisa daalaa jaae yaa phir band kar diya jaae
 An alternative is to give 4G spectrum to BSNL and MTNL
 lekin isse bhi ye companiyaan patari par nahin aaengi
 BSNL last made a profit in 2008
 uske baad se yah company 82,000 karod kaa ghaataa jhel chuki he
 By December 2018, this figure could cross 90,000 crore
 iske karmchaariyon par rajasav kaa 66 pratishat kharch hone laga he jo 2006 main 21 fisadi tha or 2008 main 27 fisadi tha
 In private telecom companies, only 5 percent of revenue is spent on employees
 kabhi BSNL ke paas 37,200 karod kaa cash bhandar tha
 Today it is at a loss of 8600 crores
 isi par financial express ke sampadak sunil jain ne twit kiya he ki ek hi rasta he ki 80 fisadi karmchaaree hataa die jaaen
 Thousands of employees come in this 80%
 bijness standard main ek ke bhattacharya kaa lekh he
 The number of employees was 34 when Manmohan Singh left the government in 2014
 5 lakh thi
 The Modi government did a fantastic job for three years and reduced the workforce to 32
 3 lakh kar diya
 Decreasing the number of employees has been praised
 bhattacharya likh rahe hai ki modi sarkaar ne 2014-15 main karmchaariyon kii sankhya main 4 pratishat kii katautee kar di
 But after that, the pace of reducing the number of employees kept decreasing
 phir bhi teen saal ke bheetar dhai lakh karmchaariyon kii sankhya ghatana shandaar uplabdhi thi
 Nevertheless, the Modi government does not stop anywhere in front of the Vajpayee government in reducing the number of government employees
 vaajapeyi sarkaar ne 2000-01 main 13 pratishat karmchaaree kam kar die the
 Manmohan Singh 6 in 2011-12
 2 pratishat kii katautee kii thi
 The author is concerned that the Modi government has lost its achievements in the last two years
 jab sarkari karmchaariyon kii sankhya badhane lagi
 By 2018-19, the number of government employees had crossed 36 lakh
 is baat par e ke bhattacharya chintit hai
 In the last year more than two lakh employees were recruited in the Income Tax Department, Police, Railways and Civil Defense
 railway main 99,000 vekency ai
 AK Bhattacharya is not from the world of Hindi news or else he also blamed the prime time job series that the months of showing pressure put the governments under pressure and the recruitment started coming out in view of the elections
 main batch gaya
 Even so, the authors are asking the answer to the question whether it was done because of the election
 bilkul chunaav ke kaaran kiya gaya tabhi to yuvaaon ne modi sarkaar ko vot kiya
 Got a job and in hopes of getting a job
 shuru ke teen saal main jo naukariyaan nahin nikaleen, uskaa gussa badhata ja rahaa tha
 Taking out the last time recruitments reduced the anger of the youth
 e ke bhattacharya ko sawaal yah poochna chahie tha ki kya shuru ke teen saal main yuvaaon ko naukariyaan nahin chahie
 It is another matter that this question does not matter to the youth
 ve tab bhi pradhanmantri modi ko hi vot dete phir bhi ek lekhak ko kiske paksh main khadaa hona chahie
 Of jobs or job cuts
 poochna chahie ki saarvajanik kshetra kii companiyon kaa haal khasta kiske kaaran hua, or iskaa laabh kise mila, inke bechney par kise laabh milegaa
 The author has written that the Modi government earned more than two lakh crores by selling the stake of one public company to another public sector company but did not privatize
 manmohan singh ne bhi 90,000 karod kii kamai kii magar nijeekaran nahin kiya
 Today, the public sector companies have collapsed
 inaki naukari kii chamak feeki ho gai he
 Banks have also done this
 yah sab likhane kaa yah matlab nahin he ki bank se lekar saarvajanik kshetra ke karmchaaree modi virdohi ho jaaenge yaa the lekin aarthik prakriyaaon ko darj to karnaa hi hota he
 i myself know that the people of the bank sector have given full support to the Modi government
 sawaal yah poocha janaa chahie ki kya is samarthan se utsahit hokar is baar modi sarkaar in karmchaariyon par meharbaani barasaayegi?bijness akhabaaron ko padhaa kiijie
 They are advocating that employees be fired
 sarkaar ke karche kaa boj kam kiya jaae
 That is why i say that Hindi readers should understand the business news
 is tark kaa andh virodh karne se pehle paristhitiyon ko bhi samajhnaa hoga
 Today the government has no money
 usne kamaane ke liye jo band jari kiye hai usee se vah upabhoktaaon ko munafa nahin de paa rahi he
 Now she is going to buy bonds from abroad
 duniya kii aarthik sthiti acchhee nahin he
 If there is no money by selling the bonds abroad then what will be the challenges before the government
 yah samajhnaa hoga
 Business Standard is continuously reporting that the profits of public sector companies and private companies are declining
 unke karze kaa boj badhata ja rahaa he
 Total cash of all public sector companies12
 8 pratishat kam ho gaya
 His loan 13
 5 pratishat bad gaya he
 The government has more stake in these companies
 lihaaza ghaataa sarkaar ko hoga
 The value of these companies will be low, even if sold, the price will be less
 phir sarkaar kaa ghaataa or zyaada badhegaa
 Business Standard credits the government in its editorial that it has talked about handling these companies
 kaha he ki vah ranneetik vinievesh karegi
 But the government should not give all the emphasis on acquiring cash through disinvestment but enable these companies to make money from today's market
 aane vaale din chunautiyon bhare hai
 If this process is delayed then jobs will be less
 jinaki hai unki kharaab hogi
 Salary will not increase and can be reversed
 yah to kisi ke saath nahin hona chahie
 Today's newspaper has published that the Suzlon company has announced a loan default of $ 172 million
 ab iskaa asar bainkon par to padegaa hi
 Nowadays the trend of writing lakhs and crores has stopped
 sarkaar bhi million or trillian bolne lagi he
 It is also reported in the Business Standard that the returns of the bonds issued by the government are the lowest in 30 months
 is bich vitt rajya mantri anuraag thakur ne rajya sabha main bataaya he ki mudra lone kaa 17,651 karod en pi e ho gaya he
 The percentage is only 2 percent but the NPA of 17,651 crore is not reduced
 mantri ne kaaran bhi bataae hai
 Business failed
 lone dene kii prakriya kaa thik se paalan nahin hua
 Now the minister will not say that banks were forced to give money loans
 sthaneey str par raajnneetik hastkshep kii madad se lone dilaae gaye
 BJP says that how many people got employment by giving Mudra loan, but it can also tell that NPA of 17,651 crores was loaned, some of the work was lost if business failed
 aarthik khabaron main khud ko sakasham kiijie
 This will give a better understanding of which direction your future is going
 sarkaar ke saamne chunautiyaan hai magar uski bhashaa main chintaa bilkul nahin he
 Should not be there
 janata aarthik nateezon ko na samajhati he or na hi iske aadhaar par janamat kaa nirmaan karti he
 Even if there are no jobs, the tone of politics can be set by speaking Jai Shri Ram
 yah ek safal formula bhi he
 Think about this question, why these news are not discussed in the Hindi world
 kyon nahin bijness ke achche akhbaar he
 Even if they were, they would have advocated that the government quickly reduce its workforce
 karmchaariyon kii sankhya ghatati to unke sampadak likhte ki sarkaar ne shandaar kaam kiya he
 Then how did the reader and the voter of Hindi read it, he also welcomes it like these editors
 kasbon main ye baaten pahunchni chahie
 In the Sanjeevani 92 that the BJP got from the Ayodhya Ram temple, Narendra Modi became a national leader in Ayodhya's Ram temple and the Babri Masjid controversy has changed the state and direction of Indian politics forever
 ramamandir andolan se bijepi ko sanjivani mili
 The result of this is that BJP is today the largest political party in the world, occupying the power of 19 states from the center
 aise main ab jab ayodhya vivaad maamle kaa faisla supreme court se aa rahaa he to narendra modi desh ke pradhanmantri hai
 The question arises as to what was being written in the media about Narendra Modi in the year 1992 when the Babri demolition took place
 india today ke march 1992 main ank main udai mahurkar ne apni ek story main narendra modi ko bhartiya janata party ke nae sitare kaa udai bataaya tha
 He wrote that 38-year-old Narendra Modi, the convener of BJP President Murli Manohar Joshi's Ekta Yatra, is becoming an important figure in the party
 or isaki vajah bhi he
 While the analysis of the yatra is going on, on the other hand, there is heated discussion in the BJP that Modi was also successful in persuading luminaries like LK Advani and Atal Bihari Vajpayee to continue the yatra
 yahi nahin abanarendra modi se bijepi ke varisht netagan salaah-mashvirabhi karte rahete hai
 The reason is simple
 rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ke halake ke jariye bhaajapa main shaamil hone ke baad chah saal kii kam avadhi main hi ve na sirf gujarat party ikai ke mahasachiv ban gaye balki rashtriya str par party ke mahatvapurn netaa bhi ban gaye
 At that time Narendra Modi was also a member of the bjp's National Executive Committee and the omnipotent six-member National Election Committee
 is samiti main laalkrishna adwani, murali manohar joshi or atal bihari vaajapeyi sareekhe varisht netaa shaamil the
 Mahurkar further writes that Narendra Modi has emerged as a party image-maker with his talent for creating catchy Hindi slogans
 yahaan tak kii raajnneeti ke sabase dhoort khilaadi chimanbhai patel bhi unki kushaagratha kaa sammaan karte hai

 isha ne jo video share kiya, usamen ve apni middle finger dikhaa rahi hai
 Fans did not like the way she is pointing
 yugers ne ise aapattijanak maanakar unhentrolkarnaa shuru kar diya
 One users even wrote that Isha should unfollow everyone
 ek yujar ne isha ko frestrated ladi likhaa, vahiin duusare ne likhaa- kya ye jaruri tha
 Why so? Another wrote that if you have a problem with your finger, you should see a doctor
 ek yujar ne likhaa he aap yahi kar sakati hai

 isi saal march main khabaren udi thim ki isha apane diziner boyfriend nikhil thampi se sagaai kar sakati hai
 This was due to his Instagram story
 bharat saal bhar main lagbhag 1500 filmein banaata he
 Only half of its films are made in the whole world, but despite this, our country has not won a single Oscar in its 100-year cinematic history
 'slamdog milaener', 'life of pai' or 'gandhi' jaisi filmein main bhale hi bhartiya angel kaa khaas mahatv ho lekin ye bhi ek kadava sach he ki in filmon ko kisi bhartiya diarector ne nahin banaaya tha
 Only 5 Indians have won Oscars so far
 inamen bhanu athaiya, rasel pukutti, e aar rahamaan, gulzaar shaamil hai
 In addition, Satyajit Ray received the Lifetime Achievement Award at the 1991 Oscar Ceremony
 kisi film kaa auskar aword jeetna kisi bhi chote desh ke liye global str par acjapozar paane kaa behtareen jariya hota he
 The victory of the Oscars is celebrated in many countries, just like the Olympics and Nobel Prizes
 soni pikchars ke ko president tom barnard kah chuke hai ki ek auskar nomination kai myanon main kisi desh ke liye kaaphi mahatvapurn hota he or kai desh to is jeet ko vishwa cap kii tarah celebratt karte hai
 In such a situation, it is important to know why in the cinematic history of 100 years, India has not been able to make such a film so that it can get the country an Oscar award
 darasal kuch filmon ko chhod diya jaae to bharat kii taraf se auskar main gai zyaadaatar filmein ausat darje kii hi rahi hai
 The great film Mother India, which came in 1957, came closest to winning the Oscar
 ye film mahaj ek vot se auskar jeetne se chook gai thi
 The films that made it to the final five at the Oscars were Meera Nair's 1988 film Salaam Bombay and Aamir Khan's 2001 film Lagaan
 1957 se 2012 tak bharat ne auskar main 45 filmein bheji hai jinamein se 30 filmein bollywood se thi lekin inamen keval 8 filmein aisi thi jinhen neshnal aword mila he
 Not being able to reach the last five of any Indian film until thirty years after Mother India, it is clear that we are not sending the best films Oscar in our country
 saal 1998 main film jeens ko auskar kii aadhikarik entry ke liye bheja gaya tha jabaki shyaam benegal kii film samar ek behtareen film thi or ise neshnal aword bhi mila tha
 But despite this, an average film Jeans was sent for the Oscars as Aishwarya Rai made her debut with the film
 aishwarya miss world kaa khitaab jeet chuki thi or unki global pahchaan ke chalate unki film ko auskar main push mila
 Similarly, in the year 2012, the film Barfi was sent for the Oscars
 haalanki film ne box offis par acha pradarshan kiya tha or ise ranbir kapur kii behtareen filmon main bhi shumaar kiya jaataa he lekin film main charlie chaplin mark kamedi seens copy kiye gaye the jiske chalate is film ke auskar main chances kaaphi kamjor ho gaye
 Vidya Balan's brilliant thriller 'kahaani' and Irrfan Khan's 'paan Singh Tomar' came out the same year but were once again missed by India
 kai baar aisa bhi hota he ki bharat kii taraf se behtareen film ko auskar ke liye bheja jaataa he lekin international market main is film kii publicity thik dhang se nahin ho paati he jisaki vajah se ye filmein badhiya expozar ke abhaav main chook jaati hai
 In Bollywood, the focus has been on the romantic comedy genre with a lot of twists and making Oscar-level films in this genre is quite difficult
 iske alaava bollywood kaa bijness model aisa he jahaan filmameking ke kai str par samjhauta hota he or film keval sthaneey bijness ko dhyaan main rakhkar hi banaai jaati he
 Many times these films do not even touch the level of the Oscars
 yahi kaaran he ki bollywood kaa ek bada hissaa keval ausat filmon par hi focus rahata he
 However, over the past few years, content-based cinema has gained dominance in India and it is expected that India's Oscar drought will be over soon

 pakistan ke purv captain shahid aafridi ne daawa kiya he ki jab unhone rashtriya under 14 trial main hissaa liya to unhen apni asli aayu kii jaankaree nahin thi or isse is mudde ko lekar sari ‘galatfahami’ shuru hui
 Afridi, known for his aggressive batting, said that when he hit a century in 37 balls in Naurobi in 1996-97, according to official figures he was 16 years old, but he was actually 19 years old (according to the autobiography 'game Changer' 21) belonged to
 aafridi ne kaha ki unhen haal main jari apni aatmakatha main apni aayu ke bare main baat karne kaa koi malaal nahin he or saath hi pushti kii ki pehle sanskaran main unke janm kaa galat varsh darj he
 Afridi said, 'the reason for my age in the records is that when i went for the under-14 trial for the first time, i did not even know my real age
 isliye jab chayankartaaon ne mujhase meri aayu ke bare main poocha to maine unhen vah jaankaree de di jo duusare logon ne mujhe di thi
 This age was officially recorded in the cricket board records and this led to a misunderstanding
 ’unhone kaha, ‘mujhe koi malaal nahin he kyonki 1996 se sabase tej ekadivasiy shatak jadne kaa record mere naam tha phir meri umr chaahe kuch bhi rahi ho
 The uproar over Afridi's age began after his autobiography
 darasal, shahid aafridi ne apni aatmakatha 'gam changer' main ek bade jhooth ko ujagara kiya, jo vah apane cricket kariyar main abhi tak chhupate hue aae the
 Afridi in his autobiography has stated that his wrong age is recorded in official documents
 website iespncricainfo kii report ke mutabik, afridi ne apni aatmakatha me likhaa he ki vah 1975 main janme the na ki 1980
 Although the former Pakistan captain has not revealed the month and day of his date of birth, it has proved one thing that Afridi was still playing cricket with a false age
 aafridi ne 1996 main antarrashtriya cricket main padaarpan kiya tha tab unki umr 16 saal kii bataai gai thi
 Afridi wrote in his autobiography, 'on record i was 19 years old and not 16 years old
 meraa janm 1975 main hua he
 Yes, the authorities misjudged my age 
 'aafridi ne isi bayaan ke saath sthiti ko or aspasht kar diya he kyonki ek taraf vah kah rah hai ki unka janm 1975 main hua he
 In this context, when he made his debut, he was 20 or 21 years old, but he himself is saying in his book that he was 19 years old
 iske baad sawaal uthne laga ki aafridi ne abhi tak apni umr ko lekar chuppi kyon saadh rakhi thi or ab jabaki unhone apni asal umr kaa khulaasa khud kar diya he to kya isisi is sambandh main koi faisla legaa? The 50-day limit for demonetisation may have ended, but the difficulties that started after demonetisation for BJP do not seem to be over
 bijepi or modi sarkaar kaa daawa he ki notebandi safal rahi he or ab halaat saamaanya ho gaye hai, lekin chote shaharon or kasbon main cash kii kami kii khabaren abhi bhi aa rahi hai
 The road is not easy for BJP, meanwhile, it is likely to have an impact on Vidhan Sabha elections to be held in five states
 khaskar goa main jahaan bijepi kii sarkaar he or 4 farvari cogova main vot dalejaayenge, lekin notebandi ke baad paryaton udyog kii tuuti qamar se bijepi ko aane vaale chunaav main jhatka lag saktaa he
 BJP will try to woo voters by taking demonetisation as a fight against black money, but the other aspect of demonetisation can create problems for BJP
 notebandi or cash kii samasya se goa main paryaton par bahut bura asar padaa he
 There has been a famine of tourists in Goa since demonetisation
 haalanki nae saal ke jashn par goa main kaaphi chahal pahal rahi lekin har saal ke mukaable is saal notebandi ne nae saal kaa jashn feekaa kar diya
 Goa's income is dependent on tourism and in this case not only the state government lost revenue but also hit every section related to tourism
 logon kii kamai par notebandi kaa asargova ke purvarim main rahane 49 saal ke firoz taxi chalaate hai or notebandi se sabase zyada maar inke rojgaar ko padi he
 Life in Goa is returning to track due to the situation created after demonetisation, but it will take time for the situation to happen like before
 firoz notebandi se pehle din main 1000 se 1500 rupee tak kama lete the lekin cash kii kami ke baad unki kamai 500 se 800 rupee par pahunch gai
 Firoz says, "earlier earnings were high, but after demonetisation, the claims of tourists have reduced, so our earnings have come down considerably
 ’kya chunaavon par iskaa asar hoga? is sawaal ke jawaab main faroj kehete hai ki, ‘jiskaa kaam dhandha kharaab hua he wo to sochega hi vot dene se pehle
 Now it will affect the election a little bit but how much will not be said
 ’20 fisadi tak gir gai kamaifiroz hi nahin 19 saal ke santosh mhadic jo panaji or dabolim ke bich hive par nariyal pani bechate hai wo bhi kehete hai ki notebandi ke baad se kaamkaaj jo thapp hua wo abhi tak sanbhal nahin paaya
 Due to lack of tourists, the daily earnings have come down from Rs 700 to Rs 400 to 450 per day
 santosh nae nae voter hai or kaam dhandha band hone se kaaphi pareshaan or naaraaz hai
 "there is a peak tourist season in Goa from October to February, but after demonetisation, our entire season has deteriorated," says Rebio Sequera, who runs a large hotel in demonetisation on hotel business
 ’ sarkaar se naaraaz sequera ke hotel main 45 logon kaa staff kaam karata he lekin touriston nahin aane se hotel ke khaali kamare ribio sequera kii jeb bhi khaali kar chuke hai
 The entire season used to earn millions, but now everything has been affected and the loss has increased
 sequera ke mutabik paryaton udyog se jude log bijepi sarkaar se naaraaz hai kyonki nuksaan ke baad kisi tarah kii bharpai nahin hui
 Most of the hotels in Goa are not full even after the peak season, so all the hotels are giving more and more discounts to the tourists so that they can earn a little bit
 jaahir he notebandi se pareshaan kaarobaari or paryaton se jude log itnaa bada nuksaan sahane ke baad chunaavon main bijepi ke liye mushkilen khadi kar sakate hai

 rajyasabha main naagarikta sanshodhan bill par hui charchacharchaa ke baad amit shah ne die sawaalon ke javabakendriya grih mantri amit shah ne rajyasabha main dopaher 12 baje naagarikta sanshodhan bill ko pesh kiya
 After which the bill was discussed in the upper house
 charchaa ke baad grih mantri amit shah ne apana jawaab sadan ke samaksh prastut kiya
 In his reply, Amit Shah said that a question arose why the bill does not contain Muslims
 main kahana chahta hum ki 6 dharm ke logon ko laa rahe hai isaki koi saraahna nahin he lekin muslim kyon nahin yah poocha ja rahaa he
 He further said that we have brought this bill by giving refuge to the minorities who have been tortured on minorities in 3 countries to give citizenship to those who do not have their previous papers

 agar phir bhi kisi ko aplikeshan deni he to wo de sakate hai unako bhi naagarikta dene kii vyavastha he
 When taken from a general view, it is believed that where there is an Islamic state, there is no possibility of persecution of the followers of Islam, therefore only Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Zoroastrian and Christian are included in this bill
 shah ne aage kaha ki hamaari party kii panthanirpekshata par sawaal khadey kiye gaye
 Have we kept only Hindus in this? iske andar sikh, jain, buddha, parsi bhi to aa rahe

 Your definition of secularism is very limited, we are comprehensive
 jo pratadit hai usee ko laana yah hamaari vyakhya he
 Your explanation is that when Muslims come, they will be considered secular only, only then they will be considered secular
 hamaari vyakhya itani simit nahin he

 Priyanka Gandhi remembered the old promise to send Chief Minister and SP President Akhilesh Yadav to Sandesa to solve the same problem
 priyankane akhilesh yadav ko bheje sandesh main likhaa he, 'aapke liye hamane azamgarh, eta, mainpuri, itawa kii sari siten chhod deen, jo ki aapkaa garh tha, to phir aap bhi amethi-raibareli kii sabhi 10 siten hamen dene kaa apana kiya vaada nibhaaiye
 Hopefully, you will fulfill the expectation that you will not give up on promise
 'sutron ke mutabik,priyankane raibareli or amethi ke congress netaaon ko aaj phir sandesh diya he ki party sabhi 10 vidhansabha siton par chunaav ladegi, aap log puri taiyaari rakhen
 It is to be noted here that SP has already announced its candidates on several assembly seats in Amethi and Rae Bareli
 yahaan amethi vidhansabha seat par sabase bada pench he, kyonki mulaayam singh ke kareebi gayatri prajapati yahi maidan main hai, jinako lekar yadav pita-putr main pehle hi kaaphi vivaad ho chukaa he
 However, there is news that on January 29, the theme of 'apne Boy (rahul-akhilesh) vs Bahri Modi and' UP Ko Ye Saath Pyaar Hai 'will be launched to promote the coalition government in UP
 vahiin sutron ke mutabik, congress ko ummid he 29 janvari ko lakhanu main hone vaali rahul -akhilesh kii saajha press vaarta se pehle amethi-raibareli kaa pench sulajh jayega
 Therefore, Priyanka has stopped amethi-rae Bareli leaders and candidates from making sarcastic remarks against SP and making statements in the media

 Swati Singh, who fought for the honor of herself and her 12-year-old daughter, is now starting to shout at meetings
 jis swati singh par bijepi dayashankar singh ke badale daanv lagaana chaahati he wo apane pati ke saath mayawati ke reliyon ke samanaantar khud ko khadaa karne kii koshish main hai
 On May 21, when Mayawati was holding her first election rally in Agra, Swati and Dayashankarkanpur and Hathras were having their first meeting
 ab jab 28 agast ko mayawati azamgarh main duusari raily karne vaali hai to swati or dayashankar baliya main apni duusari sabha karegein
 Ballia is the home district of Dayashankar
 ise baadh kii vajah se baad main taal diya gaya
 After the controversial statement of Swati Singh Dayashankar Singh came out in the open, Swati Singh came out for the first time on the slogan of abusive speech at the BSP rally
 tab swati kii lalkaar se bispi or mayawati bhi baikfoot par aa gai thi
 a month ago, Swati Singh, whom no one knew, now recognizes the entire state
 mahaj ek maheene main hi swati singh mayawati ko chunauti de rahi hai
 The BJP has realized the potential of Rallian Swati Singh under the banner of Kshatriya Mahasabha
 log chaahate hai ki swati chunaav bhi lade
 Seeing the fame gained in a month, people want to hold their rallies in many cities of Uttar Pradesh
 darasal mayawati se bhidane kii sidhi taiyaari swati singh kii he
 It is believed that the mind behind this is that of the BJP but the banner and flag is of the Kshatriya Mahasabha
 bispi ko vot nahin dene kii apilswati singh apni sabhaaon main 12 saal kii beti or khud ko gaali dene ko mudda banaati hai
 Despite the FIR against Naseemuddin Siddiqui and the imposition of the Poxo Act, no police action is being made a point in his meetings
 logon se vah kisi bhi surat main bispi ko vot nahin dene kii apil karti hai
 Mayawati challenges to contest against Swati Dayashankar Singh challenges Swati to contest against Mayawati in this assembly
 vah kehete hai ki mayawati agar saamaanya seat se lade to swati unke khilaaf chunaav ladegi
 After Azamgarh, Mayawati's rally will be held in Allahabad and Saharanpur
 dayashankar or swati ne bhi usee dauraan in shaharon ke aas paas meeting karne kaa man banaaya he
 The disputed slogan put up at the BSP rally is actually about the sports assembly elections
 dayashankar singh ne mayawati ko lekar aapattijanak shabdon kaa istemaal kiya to mayawati ne ise mudda bana diya
 Dayashankar apologized twice when the ruckus increased
 mayawati ke virodh ke baad to bijepi ne dayashankar ko party se baahar bhi kar diya
 Even after this, BSP performed in Hazratganj, Lucknow
 us dauraan dayaa kii patni swati or unki beti ko gaaliyaan di gai
 After Swati's political rally, Swati reversed the entire game
 mayawati ko gaali dene par bijepi baikfoot par thi, lekin badale main gaali milane ke baad swati ne apane boote daanv palat diya
 Leaders like Mayawati and Nasimuddin Siddiqui got sued
 phir maamla agade banaam dalit kaa ho gaya
 Will continuously follow Mayawati's rallies till Swati realizes that she has missed the BSP, Swati had hit the political ground
 party ke bheetar hi gaali dene vaale netaaon ke khilaaf khusur-phusur tej ho gai
 As Mayawati, who responded in a tit-for-tat way, retreated and announced to rally to remove focus from the abuses
 swati or dayashankar ne unka peechha nahin choda or ab taiyaari reliyon se mukaable kii he
 BJP is pushing Swati Singh, BJP may have removed Dayashankar Singh from the party for talking dirty talk against Mayawati, but it is the mind of BJP to push Swati Singh forward
 darasal bijepi jaanati he ki daliton kaa vot mayawati se hatane vaala nahin he
 In such a situation, if the upper caste vote is rounded up on this issue, it can burden their electoral losses

 Mohammed Aamir Rashid, who is said to be president of the Muslim Youth Association, has said that Kamal Haasan is anti-national, he is trying to create a rift between Hindus and Muslims with his statement
 yadi koi unke chehre par kaalikh potta he to ve use inaam ke taur par 25 hajaar rupye denge
 Speaking to a daily newspaper, Rashid said that if Hindus became extremists, no other community would be safe
 mahasabha ne diya tha acroshit bayanmahasabha ke taaja bayaan ke mutabik hindu virdohi bayaan ke liye camel hasan ko goli maar deni chahie
 Significantly, recently Kamal had said that he could not say that there is no terrorism among Hindus
 unhone kaha tha ki pehle hindu baat karte the par ab hinsa karne lage hai or isliye ab satyamev jayate se logon kaa bharosa uth gaya he kyonki ab jeet takat kii hi hoti he
 Taking objection to this, Hindu Mahasabha Vice President Ashok Sharma said, "kamal Haasan and others like him should be shot or hanged so that they can learn some lessons
" koi bhi vyakti jo hindu dharm se sambandh rakhane waalon ke liye apshabdon kaa istemaal karata he use to is paavan dharti par rahane kaa koi adhikaar hi nahin hona chahie or apshabdon ke badale main maut kii sajaa deni chahie

 * Similarly, there is Azad Public Inter College in Banda district of Uttar Pradesh
 yahaan ek ped ke neeche ek se barahavin tak kii kakshaen chalati hai, lekin shiksha vibhaag ke record main iskaa naam nahin he
 These are not just two schools, but are representative of those fake schools running in the state, on which education has become a business of plunder
 soobe ke shiksha vibhaag se manyataprapt hyskool or inter collejon kii teen shreniyan hai: sarkari, sarkaar se sahaytaprapt (aded) or vittvihin (aneded)
 According to departmental data, there are 1,000 state-run inter-colleges, 4,500 aided high schools, inter-colleges and 15,500 non-profit high schools and inter colleges in the state
 iske alaava sabhi gaiyr-manyataprapt vidhyalay farji skulon kii shrenee main aate hai
 The fake schools were revealed in the year 2006 after the widespread organized cheating in the board examinations
 tab shashan harakat main aayaa or chaatro ke panjikaran ke niyam kade kar die gaye
 It was made compulsory for accredited schools to register students studying in class IX and XI with the education department of the district, but this step was also not effective
 beete 10 varshon ke dauraan shiksha vibhaag ne pradesh main aise kareeb 50 farji vidyalayon par karrwai kii he
 Despite this, the number of fake schools remains much higher
 farji skool apane yahaan chaatro kii bhartee karte hai, lekin inkaa panjikaran manyataprapt skulon main karaate hai
 There is an open game of money in this

 ke hisaab se die gaye hai
 Apart from this, Rs 300 per student

 Indra Prakash Srivastava, Principal of Girdhari Singh Inter College, Lucknow, says, "at the time of registration of fake schools, the contract of copying in the board examination gets done
 pariksha centre kahaan padegaa? nakal kii kya vyavastha hogi? iske hisaab se nakal kaa rate tay hota he
 3,000 to 7,000 to pass through cheating in high school

 lakhanu ke ajadnagar main chal rahaa saint christ public college manyataprapt he lekin iske aadhaar par farji dhang se gitapalli ilaake main bhi isi naam se college chal rahaa he
 According to the Secondary Teachers Association estimates, there are about two dozen schools in Lucknow, with only one branch recognized
 aisa nahin he ki farji skulon kaa gathjod keval vittvihin (aneded) manyataprapt skulon se he
 There have also been cases in which government-funded accredited schools have also formed an alliance with fake schools
 2 sitambar ko shiksha vibhaag ke jaanch dal ko lakhanu public maantesri inter college, kakori kaa sarkari sahaayta praapt vidhyalay sunni inter college, nakkhaas main panjikrut mila
 When the government officials arrived to investigate this fake school in Kakori, the teachers present on the spot said that the students studying there are actually from Sunni Inter College, Nakhas, who have come to Kakori for coaching
 yaheen par farjivada pakad main aa gaya kyonki bich shahar main maujuud nakkhaas ilaake se koi chaatr 25 kimi dur gramin kshetra main koching karne kyon jayega

 In the second week of September, when the Uttar Pradesh Secondary Teachers Association started a movement against such fraud, the education authorities in Lucknow showed some action

 Similarly, there were disturbances in student numbers in more than four dozen accredited colleges
 saaf he, in collejon ne tamaam aise chaatro kaa panjikaran kara rakhaa tha jo inke yahaan nahin, balki duusare farji collejon ke chaatr hai
 Education officials do not even care whether the colleges they have accredited exist or not
 aisa hi ek vidhyalay lakhanu ke hindnagar kaa ‘sterlin public inter college’ he, jise adhikariyon ne manyata di he lekin isaki jagah vidhyalay nahin balki baraat ghar chal rahaa he

 During the last 10 years, the number of students appearing for UP Board High School and Inter examinations has increased from 45 lakhs to 62 lakhs but the number of accredited High School and Inter Colleges has increased from 18,000 to 21,000 only

 a special secretary of the Department of Education says that government high schools and inter-colleges have been arranged in the new colonies that have been developed in a planned manner in the state

 According to the special secretary, the problems are related to unplanned colonies

 lakhanu ke jila vidhyalay nireekshak umesh treepathi kuch vibhageeya dabaav kii baat sweekaar karte hai jisaki vajah se farji skulon par koi karrwai nahin ho saki
 Following the strict attitude of the teachers union, the education department has registered firs on more than 250 fake schools in the capital, showing momentum since the second week of September

 James Anderson admitted that sparring could never distract Sachin Tendulkar
 lekin england ke is tej gendbaaj kaa maananaa he ki tendulkar ke 100wein antarrashtriya shatak ko lekar jo ho hallaa machaa hua he usase test shrinkhalaa main is ballebaaj or bharat kaa pradarshan prabhavit ho saktaa he
 Anderson said about the first Test match to begin at Lord's from July 21, 'the way Sachin Tendulkar has scored 99 international centuries in the last several years, you can say that what is going on with his 100th century at Lord's
 She will be the last person to be affected by it
 ’unhone kaha,‘lekin hamane vahaan jo pichhlaa match khelaa tha usamen jo kuch hua usase hamen laga ki lords factor kisi tarah se logon ko prabhavit kar saktaa he
 Anderson's point was towards Sri Lankan batsman Dinesh Chandimal who eventually batted slow to complete his century in the ODI and his fellow batsman helped him complete his century
 unhone ‘daily mail’ main likhaa he,‘itihaas,maahaul or sab kuch vahaan hota he tathaa yah baat hameshaa aapke dimag main rahegi ki aap sambhavat: yahaan aakhri baar khel rahe hai jisase aap khel main dub jate ho or uskaa bharpoor majaa lete ho
 Anderson said that the same kind of pressure can distract Tendulkar even if he has not been playing for two decades
 unhone kaha,‘mujhe pataa he ki sachin ne lords main kabhi shatak nahin banaaya lekin mujhe vishwaas nahin hua ki vahaan unka ucchtam score 37 ran he
 i don't think he will allow his concentration to break with the possibility of his 100th international century
 ’unhone kaha,‘lekin unki is uplabdhi ko lekar sabhi acchhee tarah waakif hai or yah bhi sachai he ki unhone lords par kabhi shatak nahin jamaaya he
 This hype can have an adverse effect on his entire team
 yadi ve sachin ke bare main bahut adhik sochna shuru kar dete hai to iskaa hamen phayda mil saktaa he
 He said, 'you are bowling Sachin at any place and try to get him out as soon as possible
 eemaandaaree se kahuun to aise sthaan adhik nahin hai
 But our goal at Lord's this week is to star India star batsmen for runs and hope that we will be successful in getting them to make a mistake
 ’anderson ne kaha,‘sachin ke khilaaf main chhintakashi nahin karnaa chaahunga
 My experience is that whenever you wage a war against them, they become more committed
 sachin jab ballebaaji ke liye aayega to darshakon ke shor ko nazarandaaj karnaa aasaan nahin hoga lekin hamen apni gendbaaji par dhyaan kendrit karnaa hoga or yah nahin sochna hoga ki aap kise gendbaaji kar rahe ho
 ' liposction surgery in dinon charchaa main he
 a few days after this surgery, Telugu films actress Aarti Aggarwal worsens her health and then dies
 aarti new jersey ke ek privet aspataal main bhartee thim, jahaan shanivaar ko unki maut ho gai
 In such a situation, questions are arising whether surgery was the reason for Aarti's death? Her fans have been deeply disappointed in her going to work in several Telugu films like 'no Leka Lenu Nenu', 'indra' and 'vasantham'
 lekin isse kahin zyada chintaa vigyaan jagat or doctoron kii jamaat ho bhi ho gai he
 Aarti's manager says that the actress was struggling with obesity
 unka ilaaj chal rahaa tha, lekin achaanak dil kaa daura padane ke kaaran unka nidhan ho gaya
 It is interesting that the 31-year-old actress had gone to the US for liposuction surgery several times despite a Hyderabad doctor refusing
 mana ja rahaa he kiliposction surgerike baad fat imbolism yani dhamniyon main charbi ke tukdon ke funs jane ke kaaran hi aarti kii maut hui he

 -input IANS se You will be shocked to know how much salary Jack Dorsi, the CEO of the world micro-blogging site Twitter, has taken in the year 2018
 asal main unhone is puure saal main sirf 1
 Have taken a salary of 40 dollars (about 97 rupees)
 yahi nahin, unhone saal 2015 main siio banane ke baad pehali baar selary lee he, yani iske pehle unhone koi selary nahin lee
 The company has told the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that Twitter Inc
 CEO Jack Dorsey was the first in 2018
 40 dollar (kareeb 97 rupee) selary mili he
 Dorsey is also the co-founder of Twitter
 ve company kii shuruyaat ke daur main bhi do saal tak siio the, lekin 2008 main unhone is pad ko chhod diya tha
 In 2015, he again became the head of Twitter
 iske baad 2015, 2016 or 2017 main company kii taraf koi bhi selary yaa benifit nahin liya
 Apart from this, he also got 2 from mobile payment company 'square'
 75 dollar salanaa kii selary milti he
 In December 2018, Dorsi sold 17 million shares of Square
 forbs ke mutabik unhen isse kareeb 8 karod dollar kii kamai hui thi
 His total net worth is currently around 4
 7 arab dollar kaa he, jisamen kareeb 3
 6 of Square worth $ 9 billion
 1 karod share bhi shaamil hai
 Dorsi also owns shares worth around $ 600 million from Twitter
 unhone iske koi share nahin beche hai, jabaki twitor ke duusare ko-founder evan williams ne april 2018 se ab tak apane paas maujuud twitor ke kareeb 50 fisadi share bech die yaa daan kar die hai
 However, Dorsey is not the only person who takes a salary of around $ 1
 fasebuk ke siio mark jukerbarg, orecle ke laire ellison or google ke laire pej evam sarje brin bhi saal main ek dollar kii selary lete hai
 In the year 2012, Mark Zuckerberg earned an annual salary and 7 as a bonus
 70 lakh dollar liye the, ab vah sabase kam vetan hasil karne vaale fasebuk karmchaaree hai
 Why do big executives take a dollar salary The big officials of American companies have a customary custom to take a salary around a dollar
 asal main unki sheyaron se yaa anya tareekon se itani kamai hoti he ki ve selary na lekar company ke karmchaariyon ko acha sandesh dena chaahate hai
 So symbolically they take a dollar salary
 19veen sadi kii shuruyaat main jab jang kaa maahaul tha, tab bhi america companiyon ke sheersh adhikariyon ne ek dollar kaa vetan lene kaa chalan shuru kiya tha
 Taking such a low salary indicates that the CEO will focus his attention on increasing the value of the company's shares, as he earns only from these shares

 in se saabhaar) Rahul Gandhi, who formally assumed the number 2 position in the Congress, not only himself, but his mother Sonia Gandhi too became very emotional and wept on Saturday night
 akhil bhartiya congress cameti kii baithak main ravivaar ko rahul gandhi ne parivaar ke antarang kshanon ko congressjan se baantate hue kaha, ‘main kuch bhavuk baaten bataanaa chahta hum ki kal party kaa mujhe upaadhyaksh banaaye jane ke baad main raat ko so nahin paaya
 Woke up at four in the morning and went to the balcony
 ’rahul gandhi ne kaha, ‘bady jimmedaari mahasoos kar rahaa tha

 He said he preferred badminton when he was younger, because he shows balance
 unhone kaha, ‘daadi (indira gandhi) ke surakshakarmiyon ke saath main badminton kheltaa tha
 One day they killed my grandmother and lifted the balance

 ’pita rajeev gandhi ke bare main rahul ne kaha ki vah sabase bahadur aadamiyon main se the lekin (indira ke nidhan ke samay) vah khud bhi ro rahe the

 ’rahul ne aage kaha, ‘kal raat jab sabane mujhe badhai di, upaadhyaksh hone ke liye
 
 
 At night my mother (sonia Gandhi) came to my room, sat nearby and started crying because she knows that power is poison

 ’ Amid demonetisation, Geeta, assistant constable of Dantewada in Chhattisgarh and Amit Dhurva, a nursing student from Jagdalpur, married with simplicity at the local Gayatri temple, costing less than a thousand rupees 
 vivaah main shaamil logon ne bhi keval chaay-naashtaa kar navadanpati ko aashirwad diya
 Geeta Bihari, Assistant Constable of Dantewada, was from Amit Dhruv, a resident of Jagdalpur, doing a nursing course in Kavaiah Hyderabad
 navadanpati kaa kahana he ki ve bhi dhoomdhaam se shaadi rachaana chaahate the lekin pradhanmantri narendra modi ke cashles nirnay or bank se adhik raashi na milane se saadagi bhari shaadi kaa nirnay liya
 Those involved in the wedding ceremony gifted the couple with blessings

 About 500 on breakfast, 200 rupees in Jayamala, Prasad of 51 rupees and Dakshina of 151 rupees for Pandit

 The mother has heart disease and has just undergone an operation
 ghar kaa puraa jimmedaari amit par he
 Similarly, Geeta is also handling the responsibility of younger brother and sister since the death of parents, both know the importance of Rs
 unka kahana he ki modi ji kesandeshne unke vichaaron ko bal diya
 Efforts are on to unite opposition parties against Narendra Modi in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, but the format of the alliance has not been decided yet
 in sabake bichamayawatine ravivaar ko kaha ki gathbandhan tabhi hoga jab unki party ko sammanjanak siton par ladane kaa mauka milegaa, varanaa wo akeli hi chunaav main utrengi
 However, he also called the alliance very important to stop the BJP
 aise main sammanjanak siton se mayawati kaa ishaara kis taraf he
 Is this fight limited to UP or are you expecting some seats in other states of the country? The BSP is based in other states outside UP as well
 haalanki mayawati ne apni shart rakhkar baaki dalon ke liye nayaa pench fansaa diya he
 But in any case, Akhilesh Yadav does not want to leave the BSP
 india today ke mind rox main akhilesh yadav ne kaha tha ki bijepi ko satta main aane se rokane ke liye kitni bhi siton par samjhauta kar luungaa
 In such a situation, there are four formulas based on which the BSP can be estimated to share respectable seats and seats in the Grand Alliance
 ranaap siton kaa formula2014 loksabhaa chunaav main upi kii 80 siton main se bijepi gathbandhan ko 73 siten mili thim
 While SP had got five seats and Congress had two seats, bsp's account was also not opened
 aise ab mahagathbandhan ke liye siton ke bantwaare ke liye jin siton par jo party duusare number par rahi he, ve siten unke khate main di jaae
 In this regard, BSP came second on 34 seats, SP 31 seats and Congress in only 6 seats
 is formule par siton kaa bantwaaraa hota he to phir basapa ke khate main sabase zyada siten aaengi
 Will these be respectable seats for Mayawati, who will agree
 basapa kii upi se baahar siton kii khwahishcongress ke baad vipakshi dalon main basapa eklauti aisi party he jiskaa aadhaar upi ke alaava bhi duusare rajyon main he
 The BSP has also contested assembly and Lok Sabha elections there
 vidhansabha main to kuch rajyon main unke vidhayak hai, lekin loksabhaa main sirf madhya pradesh kii ek seat hi jeet saki thi
 The strength of the bsp's Dalit vote bank has increased Mayawati's stature in current politics
 yahi vajah he ki mayawati duusare rajyon main siten maang rahi hai
 Mayawati feels that if she can win a lot of seats and gets enough seats, then her dream of becoming PM can be fulfilled
 sutron kii maane to congress vidhansabha chunaav main kuch siten dene ko taiyaar he lekin loksabhaa siton ko lekar rajamand nahin dikh rahi
 The BSP had won the most seats in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections in the bsp's best result Lok Sabha elections so far
 basapa ko 27
 It had 20 seats with 20 percent votes
 basapa kii raajnneeti main ye sabase behatar parinaam tha
 While 23 to SP
 26 fisadi voton ke saath 23 siten or congress 11
 It was successful in winning 65 percent of the votes and 21 seats
 jabaki areldi ko paanch siten mili thim
 The Congress wants seats on this formula, but the SP BSP does not agree to it
 2004 main sapa ko sabase zyada sitensapa ke sabase zyada saansad 2004 ke loksabhaa chunaav main jitkar aae the
 26 to SP
 74 fisadi vot ke saath 35 siten, basapa ko 24
 19 seats and Congress 12 with 67 percent of the vote
 04 fisadi vot ke saath 9 siten mili thim
 SP seems to have this formula in its favor, but the BSP is not ready to take it
 basapa kii sabase zyada siton kii mangabaspa ne mahagathabandhan kaa hissaa banane ke liye sammanjanak siton kii shart rakhi he
 For this, allies agree to give maximum seats to BSP out of 80 Lok Sabha seats of UP, but are not ready on more than 36 seats
 vahiin, sapa ko 32, congress ko 9 or areldi ko 3 siton kaa formula banaaya ja rahaa he
 While sources are saying, the BSP is asking for 40 seats, which is not being discussed
 bataa den ki gorakhpur-phulpur or kairana main loksabhaa upachunaav main bijepi ko mili haar or vipaksh ko mili jeet ke baad se hi mahagathbandhan kii aas jaagi
 If Akhilesh and Mayawati meet together, the direction of the alliance will speed up, but there is a screw up in the grand alliance on seat sharing

 Excerpts from a conversation with actor Ashish Chaudhary, who has dropped out of the celebrity dance reality show Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa
 jhalak kaa safar kaisaa rahaa?jabajhalak dikhalaa ja shuru hua tha to main bahut nervastha
 i did the show only at the behest of Karan Johar and i was comfortable with Colors Channel
 mujhe yah karne main majaa aane laga tha
 This journey was very tiring
 apane saath hue haadase ke bare main bataaen?hamaare sho main makenical sazosaman nahin rahata he
 Four or five people were pulling the harness i was hanging on
 jab main hawa main tha to do log phisal gaye
 i suddenly came down but no hurt
 meraa samay kharaab chal rahaa tha, unhone mujhe galat samay par uthaaya or aakhir main ve apana puraa control hi kho baithe
 Half of my act was Ariel and it completely broke
 meri haalat bina sahare ke bandar jaisi ho gai
 i and my choreographers could do nothing because the whole work was in the hands of other people
 lekin ve niyantran nahin kar sake
 i knew i would be out
 lekin meri daancing shuru se lekar aakhir tak sahi rahi, yahi mere liye khushi kii baat he
 If i had spoken about my problems, it would have been a loser
 main shikaayat karne main yakeen nahin rakhata
 i am just talking because i want to tell my fans what happened to me
 unhen pataa chalanaa chahie ki main ekadam sahi tha lekin haaranes mere kaabo main nahin tha
 Do you think that's right with you? The decision of the judges was right? It is a game, its rules cannot be broken
 mujhe niyamon kaa paalna karnaa tha
 All i can say is that this type of problem should not have come
 jajon ke haath bhi niyamon se bandhe the
 i did not get a second chance despite my choreographer being injured due to the format
 jhalak ne aapako kya sikhaaya?fier factor ne sikhaaya ki apane daron se upar aana chahie
 For me, if the player of dangers was to overcome fear, then Jhalak has given me the biggest fear of my life from dancing
 isane mujhe sikhaaya ki stage par jaao or ji khol kar dance karo
 Now i can dance on stage without any fear
 jajon ke bare main bataaen?kai logon ne kaha ki jajon ko mujh se dikkat thi sirf karan ko chhodkar
 i always felt that they wanted more hard work from me so that i could work harder
 maine har kisi main positive dekhne kii koshish kii
 Ganesh was a tough judge and he always used to remove a lot of flaws about me
 main unhen impress karne kii koshish karata tha
 When my journey on the show ended, they came to me and said that i was doing well
 mujhe acha laga ki unhone meri growth ko pahachaanaa
 Lauren of course has not been very soft on me regarding Marx
 lekin main jaanata hum ki ve mujhe acha karata dekhnaa chaahati thim
 When the problem related to the loss came, she angrily went to them and tortured them a lot
 lauren ne mujhase do baar baat kii or kaha ki unhen mujhe baahar karte hue kharaab lag rahaa he
 She did not care what marks she gave me but she liked me
 shahid bhi meri tarif karte the
 Karan was good only
 apane baaki saathiyon ke bare main kya kahana he?sho main hissaa lene vaale bhaagi contestant mere liye parivaar jaise the
 The same was in the player of dangers
 jhalak khatm hote hi main unase mila
 Making friends is my glimpse
 jhalak kii koun-si cheez aap sabase zyada miss karenge?main apni koreographer failan ko sabase zyada miss karuunga
 Raushali and Fallan worked very hard for me
 ab aage kya karenge?maine ye sho sirf isliye ki kyonki main inhen lekar excited tha
 My choice is fiction
 reality sho bahut ho chuke hai
 i want to return to acting again
