 mahangaai ke mudde par ab tak ek kamjor vipaksh kii bhoomika main rahi bijepi bhi duusari vipakshi partiyon kii tarah sarkaar par dabaav bananaa shuru kar di he
 Earlier in the BJP Parliamentary meeting, all the party mps considered a strategy to surround the government in the House
 vahiin rajyasabha main donon paksh bahes ke liye taiyaar hai
 It seems that the Prime Minister had already got an idea of the opposition's tone, so at the beginning of the budget session, he gave the message of peace to the opposition
 lekin ab tak mahangaai ke mudde ko bhunaane main naakaam rahi bijepi ke tevar tikhe hai
 The party has bluntly told the government that enough is enough
 sadan main charchaa hogi to kaarysthgan prastaav ke tahat, nahin to sadan nahin chalegaa
 Deputy Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha Gopinath Munde said that there should be discussion under the adjournment motion, otherwise the house will not be allowed to run
 jaahir he satta paksh ho yaa vipaksh congress se naaraaz tamaam partiyaan bhi manhagaai ke mudde par sarkaar ko gherne ke liye qamar kase hue hai
 In such a situation, the government has rejected the opposition's demand by repeating the rules
 sansadeey kaarymantri pawan kumaar bansal ne kaha he ki ham bahes ke liye taiyaar hai lekin unki maang dekh kar to yahi lagata he ki ve bahes nahin chaahate vaise raashtrapati ke bhaashan ke baad kaa samay dhanyavad prastaav kaa hota he lekin vipaksh ke tevar ko dekh kar to yahi lagata he ki bajet satr main sarkaar kii raah aasaan nahin hogi

 But i know that you will still be abused after this

 Earlier, Yashwant Sinha has been constantly trolled on Twitter for criticizing the BJP
 bijepi ne kiya tha swaagatmob linching ke doshiyon ko jamaanat milane par na sirf jayant sinha ne unka swaagat kiya balki bijepi karyaalay main iskaa jashn manaaya gaya tha
 Former MLA Shankar Chaudhary, who had been continuously agitating for the release of these convicts, held a press conference at the BJP office itself and expressed happiness at getting bail
 unhone kaha tha ki wo court ke faisle kaa sammaan karte hai
 What is the whole matter: On 29 June 2017, a businessman Alimuddin Ansari was beaten to death by a mob in Ramgarh, Jharkhand
 alimuddin apni vine se maance lekar aa rahaa tha
 She was caught by some people suspected of having beef in the van
 un logon ne pehle uski gaadi ko aag lagaai or phir alimuddin ko berahami se maut ke ghat utaar diya
 Tension had increased in the area after the incident
 doshiyon ke khilaaf kadi karrwai ke aashwaasan ke baad hi alimuddin kaa parivaar shav lene ko taiyaar hua tha
 In this murder, 11 people have been sentenced to life imprisonment
 vahiin, ek naaballig bhi isamen shaamil he, jise bal sudhaar grih bheja gaya he
 Recognizing the evidence and argument given by advocate BN Tripathi during the court hearing, the court refused to consider the video footage made during the murder as evidence
 is vajah se 8 logon ko jamaanat mil gai
 An application for bail of 3 people was not made
 is vajah se unhen jamaanat nahin mil saki thi
 The Karnataka assembly election is being considered as the semifinal of the 2019 Lok Sabha election
 yahi vajah he ki rajya kii siyaasi baaji jeetne ke liye congress or bijepi ne puri takat jhonk di he
 BJP is trying to return to power by putting forward the face of BS Yeddyurappa
 party ne booth prabandhan ke jariye karnataka kaa siyaasi maidan maarane kii ranneeti banaai he
 The party has made a special plan for this
 booth management kaa plankarnataka kii sabhi 224 vidhansabha siton ke booth prabandhan ke liye bijepi ne ranneeti banaai he
 The party has divided each assembly constituency into four parts and appointed different incharge for it
 ye jimmedaari aise netaaon ko saunpi gai he, jinhen jamini raajnneeti kii behatar samaj he
 a senior BJP leader, on the condition of anonymity, said that all the seats in the state have been divided and divided into 2 to 4 seats
 zyaadaatar vidhansabha siton ko chaar hisson main baanta gaya he
 Responsibilities of about 50 booths with one in-charge are receiving reports of party candidate from the booth workers in-charge daily

 rajya kii kai siton par bahut kam antar se haar-jeet hogi isliye aisi siton par jis dal ke kaaryakarta zyada sakriy rahenge wo party phaayde kii sthiti main rahegi
 Let me tell you that there is a fierce competition between the Congress and the BJP in Karnataka
 survey ke mutabik donon partiyon ke bich bahut zyada antar nahin he
 There is a slight difference in seats and vote percentage
 aise main bijepi koi kami nahin chhodana chaahati
 In view of this, the party has devised a strategy to give maximum emphasis on booth management

 akshay kumaar or tvinkal khanna bollywood ke kool kapal main shumaar hai
 The two often share a post full of sweet nozzle on Instagram
 janvari main apni saalagirah ke avasar par tvinkal akshay ko panch karti nazar ain thi
 He recently took Akshay Kumar's class once again on social media because he did not know the meaning of an English word
 tvinkal ne ye bhi bataaya ki jab unhone akshay ko is shabd kaa matlab samajhaana chaha to superstar actor ne unhen mahapakau kah daalaa
 Twinkle posted a picture of Akshay on Instagram
 is photo main akshay blike rang kii turtal nek tishart main nazar aa rahe hai
 Twinkle wrote in the caption of this photo - a tip for Indian men - a black turtle neck tshirt can make you smart on an exponential level, just don't ask the lady sitting next to you what that means
 or haa, is shabd kaa matlab samajhane par kisi ko 'maha pakaau' kahkar sambodhit karnaa bilkul phaayde kaa sauda nahin hoga
 Significantly, Twinkle has been known for her sense of humor
 coffee vid karan ke saath-saath kai chat shos par ve apane humar kaa pradarshan karti rahi hai
 However, despite being the daughter of stars like Rajesh Khanna and Dimple Kapadia, she was not particularly interested in films and she was always interested in books and after retiring from Bollywood, she has written three books
 akshay or tvinkal ne is saal janvari main apni shaadi ke 18 saal puure kar liye hai
 a tip for Indian men: a black turtleneck can make most of you seem exponentially smarter — just don't ask the woman sitting on the other side of your granola what 'exponentially' means
 Also it doesn’t help if you call the other person’maha Pakau’when they give you the definition

 baat 1980-90 ke gujarat ke ahmedabad main ek saamaanya-se madhyavargeey parivaar kii he
 The head of this house was run by Bhima Vakani Theater Company and was also a teacher in high school
 ve rangamanch par apane johar dikhaate to unki bitiyaa papa ke rangamanchi kaushal par kareeb se najar rakhti
 The observation power of the girl was amazing
 vah aksar apane pita ko apane naatakon kii heroinon ke liye pareshaan hote dekhati
 Boys had to become girls because it was not the practice of Gujarati girls to enter the theater at that time
 us ladki ne usee din soch liya ki vah apane pita ke naatakon kii heroin banegi
 She would often hear her father say that whatever work you do, keep the entire focus on it
 bas, usne yah baat ganth baandh lee
 She did 12th and then a diploma in Dramatics
 phir vah din bhi aayaa jab usne apane pita ke theatre main bataur nayika kaam kiya
 That little girl has become the big name of the screen today
 yah ladki tarak mehta kaa ulataa chashma kii dayaa bhabhi urf disha vaakani hai
 "the family played an important role in what i learned," says Disha, 36
 papa kabhi mere dost ban jate to kabhi mere teacher
 "disha was born and brought up in Ahmedabad
 unase bada ek bhai (mayur vaakani) or choti bahan khushhaali he
 Sisters and brothers also study and they have a great mood in the theater with their father
 ve chaar-paanch saal kii umr se hi naatak karne lageen
 His elder brother Mayur (tarak Mehta
 
 
 main ve unke chote bhai sundar kaa kirdaar nibhaa rahe hai) bataate hai ki bacchon ke naatak main 80 saal kii budhinga kaa nibhaayaa disha kaa kirdaar unhen aaj bhi yaad he
 In his words, "discovery's Observation Power is awesome
 mere saath ek mjedaar vakya hua
 My wife Hemali says "no" differently
 maine kabhi gaur nahin kiya
 One day went to see the drama of Disha, then saw him playing that character in a different style on the stage
 jaise hi vah ai, maine kaha ki tumhaara bolne kaa andaaj to kamaal tha bahna
 i asked, where did you learn? So she laughingly said, brother, sister-in-law speaks like this
 ”unhone filmi duniya ke liye apana sangharsh 1997 se shuru kiya
 He did minor roles in films like Devdas (2002), Mangal Pandey: The Rising (2005) and Jodha Akbar (2008)
 lekin kismat ko kuch or manjuur tha
 One day in 2008, his friend told him that production house Neela Telefilms Taarak Mehta
 
 
 ke liye audishan le rahaa he
 Disha immediately reached there and auditioned
 serial ke produsar asit kumaar modi bataate hai, “kai ladakiyon ne audishan die
 Looking at the direction, she felt that she would be able to play this character
 jab unhone dayaban kii aawaaj nikaali or hansin to us samay mujhe puri tarah se yakeen ho gaya
 "she attributes her distinct voice and laughter to her quality of mimicry
" disha kahati hai, “rangamanch ke mere anubhav or mimicri ne is kairactor main jaan daalane main madad kii
 This is how the journey started
 sho ke shuru hone par disha ko ek hi tarah kii aawaaj roj nikaalani padati thi
 She explains, "it was not easy to make a kind of sound everyday
 mujhe namak or haldi se garaare karne padate the
 "it's been seven years and 1,700 episodes now, and she's used to all these things
" yahi nahin, unke garba ke diwaanon kii bhi kami nahin he
 Due to this, her name is Garba Queen
 salmaan khan to disha ke saath garba main haath bhi dikhaa chuke hai
 She smiles, "some of Garba's steps belong to the choreographer and some are my own
 jaise picock step meraa khud kaa he
 "actually merry on-screen or instant mercy with people is completely different from real life
 ve bahut hi sanjidagi se baat karti hai
 She is shy and does not let her presence be realized if she is sitting among people
 lekin camere ke saamne aate hi jaise unhen pankh lag jate hai
 Disha also believes that it takes some time for people to get along
 asal jindagi ve kitni bhi sanjeeda hon lekin dayaban hone kii vajah se log unhen dekhakar hi muskaraane lagate hai
 Many times it happens that before talking, they start laughing fast
 disha bataati hai, “aaj ke mushkil bhare maahaul main aap kisi ke chehre par bina kuch kahe hansi laa den isse badi safalataa kya ho sakati he
 On many occasions people start asking that Tappu (his onscreen son) has been admitted? Also when will Popat get married? ”daya has not given head to the success achieved in the last seven years
 ve itnaa hi kahati hai ki insaan chaahe kitna bhi bada kyon na ho jaae, uski bhukh to daal-roti se hi mitati he
 Tarak Mehta
 
 
 main unke pati jetha laal kaa role kar rahe dilip joshi kehete hai, “ve down tu arth hai
 Generally i have seen that when the actor becomes famous, there are tantrums inside them
 pehle din se aaj saat saal ho gaye hai, disha ne kabhi naaj-nakhre nahin dikhaae
 “disha Healthy Food, which makes Gujarati dishes for Jetha Lal, often prefers to eat
 yahi vajah he ki pichley saat saal main unke luk main ratti bhar badlaav nahin aayaa he
 She says, "I definitely do yoga
" or fal or mewa bahut khaati hum
 "reading is their hobby
" fursat milane par ve filmein bhi dekhati hai
 If you want to, then it also takes lukewarm
 jitani sidhi-saadi ve khud hai utane hi saadagi bhare unase jude kisse hai
 Once it happened that he had to go to Andheri for shooting
 jamkar barish ho rahi thi
 The driver did not come and he did not know how to drive
 bahut bhatkin lekin taxi bhi nahin mili or sadakon par taxi ke liye yun bhatakate hue unhen jabardast gussa aayaa or usee din unhone car chalaanaa seekhney kaa pran kar liya
 Moreover, when simplicity becomes a pity, it becomes very dangerous
 set par aksar aisa hota he
 Once his cylinder was close to the firstborn's nose
 
 
 sany se guzar guya tha
 But such stories happen on the set
 disha jald vivaah bandhan main bandhane ja rahi hai
 But when the personal question comes, she becomes completely silent
 is tarah parade par najar aane vaali dayaa gaayab ho jaati he or asal jindagi kii disha saamne aa jaati he

 He said, according to me, Yuvraj and Sehwag will not play the 2015 World Cup
 sahvaag meri najar main sabase bade openar hai
 Yuvraj is a special player
 cricket main naammumkin kuch nahin hota lekin yuvaraj or sahvaag ke liye vaapasi bahut mushkil he
 On the talk of Yuvraj and Sehwag, Sohail said, 'time catches you
 bhartiya team ke paas stroke players hai
 In the middle order, Rohit Sharma is a very good choice who is capable of taking the innings forward in the event of a wobble

 Although giving Australia a slight edge, i consider it to be the number one contender

 If this team is going then i do not expect that we will win the World Cup
 agar sahvaag, yuvaraj team main hote hai to agal baaten hongi
 Ajay Jadeja gave rise to a controversy between the selectors and the captain saying that everything was not going well
 unhone kaha, ‘sellection team kuch chunati he lekin captain kii team agal hoti he
 i believe that a team should have only one leader
 agar dada (ganguli kii or ishaara karte hue) ko team main jo player chahie wo nahin diya jaae to bhala wo match kaise jeeta sakenge
 Aamir Sohail too, considering the big role of team selection, said, 'the selection committee should have a plan
 uske baad wo captain se baaten karen
 Usually, the team is chosen only after talking to each other
 yahaan meraa maananaa he ki team sellection main captain kii 60 fisadi baaten jarur manani chahie

 On the radio, when the Prime Minister expressed his feelings about depression in Mann Ki Baat, then the Prime Minister of the country was concerned about the mental health of the country
 biimaar, khastahal buniyadi dhaanche ko sudhaarney ke liye abaki bajet badhkar rahegaa
 But the two budgets so far have not increased much
 abaki dekhen modi ji ke man kii baat bajet main jhalkegi yaa is baar bhi
 
 
 The matter was about two years ago when Prime Minister Narendra Modi became almost sentimental about 'mental health'
 ho bhi kyon na, world health orgenigeshan kii ek report ne unhen baichaiyn kar diya tha
 There were reports that depression cases increased by 18 per cent between 2006-2016
 is report main bharat ko khatre ke nishaan ke kareeb bataaya gaya
 If you look at the 2016-17 report of the National Family Health Survey, then the danger will be felt more
 desh main 60 karod log kisi na kisi maansik beemaari se grast hai
 Ie 6
 5 fisadi deshvasi maansik beemaari se jujh rahe hai
 If you look at the 2017 report of the National Institute of Mental Health and Neuroscience, this figure is 13
 8 fisadi he
 By 2020, this figure will increase to 20 percent
 aaj desh kaa har chatha vyakti kisi na kisi tarah ke depressant se jujh rahaa he
 This report made the Prime Minister's heart heavy
 ‘man kii baat’ kaarykram main modi ji ne is mudde ko uthaakar man halakaa kar liya
 The Prime Minister offered free advice to 'overcome depression'
 unhone kaha, ''mere pyaare deshavaasiyon avsaad se ubarne kaa pehla mantra he, avsaad ke kaarnon ke bare main kisi se baat na karnaa, isile ise dabaaen nahin jaahir karen
 "any seasoned psychologist would also suggest that depression arises when the grievous complaints and anger reach its peak
 isliye jabardastee gusse ko dabaaen nahin, khulkar jataaen
 This is also the first advice the counselor gives to a psychiatrist during counseling
 aam bolchaal main ise bhadaas nikaalnaa bhi kah sakate hai
 But does a person with depression tell his mind so easily? The higher the level of depression, the more emphasis the counselor will have to spew the mind of the psychopath
 agar avsaad gambhir he to 2-3 seshan to rogi bas niharta hi rahata he
 If in the initial stage of depression, the aggrieved person expresses his pain in the first or second session
 lekin kya itane manovaigyanik bharat main hai jo avsaad hi nahin chintaa, ghabrahat, asthirataa jaisi bimariyon se mukt kara saken? yaa phir gambhir str par pahunch chuki bimaariyaan jaise chizophrenia, pairanoiya jaise vyaktitv ko khand-khand kar dene vaali bimariyon se nizaad dilaa saken?kya maansik bimariyon se jujh rahe deshavaasiyon kii sehat sudhaarney ke liye desh kii sarkaar ke paas paryaapt bajet he? bina paryaapt buniyadi dhaanche ke kya modi ji ke man kii baat bhar se desh kii maansik sehat sudhar jaaegi? or aakhir main bina bajet kya buniyadi dhaancha sudhar paaegaa?maujuuda samay main swasthya bajet kaa mahaj 0
 Only 07 percent is being spent for mental health so far
 ab jaraa swasth bajet bhi dekhen
 This is only 2 percent of the entire budget
 jahaan desh kii maansik sehat khatre main he vahaan itte se bajet se kya bhala hoga? prati ek lakh manorogiyon ke peeche bharat main sirf 0
 30 psychiatrists, 0
 17 norsen, 0
 05 are psychologists
 in par meharbaani kiijie hujur!pichley saal disambar kii baat he uttar pradesh ke banda jile ke ek kasbe ke chauraahey main ek vyakti zanjeeron se baandha dekha gaya
 a philanthropist there interacted with the person and brought him to his home
 ghar waalon kaa kahana tha ki yah baar-baar hinsak ho jaataa he
 Therefore, in order to punish the family members tied him to the railings in the middle of the square in the scorching cold
 log use dekhakar aage bad jate
 People were quietly going out of it, assuming it was a hindrance of ghosts
 gudgaanv main gambhir maansik beemaari se jujh rahe logon ke liye desh kaa pehla de care chalaa rahi reeta sethi sanstha ke paas gudgaanv jaise haai-fi ilaake main maujuud aise logon kii cese studies ke aankadon ke aadhaar par kahati hai, ‘’aise krur najaare gramin bharat main aaj bhi dikh jate hai
 Yes, people in cities do not keep people struggling with mental illness in squares but keep them in some corner of the house
 ’’ ve bataati hai, ‘‘ hamane gudgaanv ke aasapaas kai manorogiyon ko zanjeer se mukt karaayaa unamem se kai to aise the jinhone saalon baad raushnee dekhi
 "in such a situation, when the Prime Minister raised the issue of depression in 'mann Ki Baat' two years ago, then there will be confidence that now the mental health of the country will improve
 lekin bajet pesh hua to ummid aundhe munh gir padi
 Because there was no increase in the budget
 ab ek baar phir jab bajet pesh hone vaala he, aise main ek baar phir maansik beemaari se jujh rahe deshavaasiyon ke man main mental health ko lekar agar imoshan jaagen to hairaani kisi? hujur! abaki baar mashvira nahin manshaa jaahir kiijie or kuposhan se jujh rahe maansik swasthya ke bajet kii sehat par bhi dhyaan dijie
 *** wo bollywood ke hot bachaler the
 But the girl was also no less
 apane doston kii jaan or sabaki muskaan thi
 The two met, chatted, grew slowly, fell in love and got married
 ye kahani he 'kamine' shahid kapur or kute mira rajput kii
 When they got married, different things were said
 par donon ne apane rishte ko har buree najar se bachaakar rakhaa
 On 7 July 2015, Shahid and Meera got married in a very private ceremony
 ek ore jahaan shahid bollywood hero the vahiin mira, girl next door
 Their marriage was completely arranged
 par ab jab bhi donon najar aate hai, unke bich kaa pyaar khud hi dikh jaataa he
 They are considered one of the best couples in Bollywood
 
 
 or ye sirf kehane kii baat nahin he
 If you have noticed then these are some such special occasions, when anyone can see them, they can say that they are made for each other
 1
 That first chance
 
 
 shaadi ke din jis tarah shahid ne mira kaa haath tham rakhaa tha, use dekhakar unke bich kaa bharosa saaf najar aa rahaa tha
 2
 ye haath kabhi chute naa
 
 
 Whether it is airport or dinner
 
 
 yaa phir koi soshal gadering
 Shahid holds Meera's hand and Meera continues smiling alongside him
 
 
 3
 Shahid and Meera often post their selfies on social sites
 unhen dekhakar unki khushi kaa andaja lagaaya ja saktaa he
 4
 donon kii nazren ek-duusare par hi rahati hamehfil main bhale hi hajaaron log hon lekin shahid kii najar main sirf mira dikhti hai or mira kii najar main unke
 
 
 5
 stylish kapalajab mira or shahid kii shaadi hui thi to bahut se logon ko ye dout tha ki mira staradam ko handle kaise karengi
 But Meera has silenced people every time with her stylish avatar

 Going on a babymoon also says that a lot of Shahid is always worried about his pregnant wife
 in dinon wo apana zyada se zyada vakt patni mira ke saath bitaa rahe hai
 Whether they want to feed them in their favorite restaurant or take them to babymoon
 khabar he ki abhinayta randeep hooda ne sarbajit kii jindagi par banane vaali film karne ke liye 11 karod kii moti rakam kii maang kii he, isliye aisa mumkin he ki randeep hooda is film se hi baahar ho jaaen
 Randeep Hooda was to play the role of Sarabjit Singh in the film on Sarabjit's life, who accidentally crossed the border and remained in a Pakistani jail for 20 years and finally a prisoner in the same jail attacked Sarabjit with such a fatal attack She lost her life
 vaise aapako bataa den kii is film kii jab se ghoshnaa hui he, tab se kai badlaav ho chuke hai
 First of all, Kangana Ranaut dropped out of the film to play the role of Sarabjit's sister and Aishwarya Rai's entry in the film came in place of Kangana
 uske baad is film ke nirdeshak badale
 Earlier, director Hansal Mehta, who was in discussion with the film 'shahid', was to direct, but later Hansal was out and in the hands of Omung Kumar, the director of the film 'mary Kom', who was given the responsibility of directing the film
 tippaniyan Now the news is coming that Randeep Hooda is asking for Rs 11 crore to play the role of Sarabjit
 saath hi ye bhi charchaa ho rahaa he ki ab bhi filmkaar randeep se baatcheet kar rahe hai or agar wo film ke bajet ke anusaar mehtaanaa lene ko raji hue to wo is film kaa hissaa rah sakate hai
 But a question arises that if Randeep asked for 11 crores, why did he? Because sometimes when actors do not feel like doing a film, then they ask extravagantly money so that the producer does not chase them repeatedly to do the film and if Randeep has really asked for 11 crores, is it justified, because No film in the name of Randeep could do business of 11 crores at the box office
 randeep hooda sarbajit kii jindagi par banane vaali film main sarbajit singh kii bhoomika nibhaane vaale the, jo galati se sarhad paar hue or 20 saal tak pakistan kii jail main band rahe or aakhirkaar usee jail main kisi kaidi ne sarbajit par aisa jaanaleva hamalaa kiya ki unki jaan chali gai
 By the way, since the announcement of this film, many changes have been made since then
 sabase pehle to kangana ranavat film se baahar huin jo sarbajit kii bahan kii bhoomika nibhaane vaali thim or kangana kii jagah is film main aishwarya raay kii entry kii khabar ai
 The director of this film changed after that
 pehle is film ko 'shahid' film se charchaa main aae nirdeshak hansal mehta diarect karne vaale the, magar baad main hansal baahar hue or film ke nirdesan kii jimmedaari saunpi gai film 'mericom' ke nirdeshak omang kumaar ke haathon main
 The comments ab khabar aa rahi he ki sarbajit kii bhoomika nibhaane ke liye randeep hooda 11 karod rupee maang rahe hai
 It is also being discussed that the filmmakers are still talking to Randeep and if he agrees to take the remuneration according to the budget of the film, then he can remain a part of this film
 lekin ek sawaal uthta he ki randeep ne agar 11 karod kii maang kii to kyon kii? kyonki kabhi kabhi actors kaa jab man nahin hota kisi film ko karne kaa tab wo ootpataang paise maangate hai taaki nirmaataa film karne ke liye unka baar baar peechha na kare or agar vaaki main randeep ne 11 karod maange hai to kya ye jaij mehtaanaa he, kyonki randeep ke naam par koi film 11 karod kaa bijanas nahin kar paati box offis par
 By the way, since the announcement of this film, many changes have been made since then
 sabase pehle to kangana ranavat film se baahar huin jo sarbajit kii bahan kii bhoomika nibhaane vaali thim or kangana kii jagah is film main aishwarya raay kii entry kii khabar ai
 The director of this film changed after that
 pehle is film ko 'shahid' film se charchaa main aae nirdeshak hansal mehta diarect karne vaale the, magar baad main hansal baahar hue or film ke nirdesan kii jimmedaari saunpi gai film 'mericom' ke nirdeshak omang kumaar ke haathon main
 The comments ab khabar aa rahi he ki sarbajit kii bhoomika nibhaane ke liye randeep hooda 11 karod rupee maang rahe hai
 It is also being discussed that the filmmakers are still talking to Randeep and if he agrees to take the remuneration according to the budget of the film, then he can remain a part of this film
 lekin ek sawaal uthta he ki randeep ne agar 11 karod kii maang kii to kyon kii? kyonki kabhi kabhi actors kaa jab man nahin hota kisi film ko karne kaa tab wo ootpataang paise maangate hai taaki nirmaataa film karne ke liye unka baar baar peechha na kare or agar vaaki main randeep ne 11 karod maange hai to kya ye jaij mehtaanaa he, kyonki randeep ke naam par koi film 11 karod kaa bijanas nahin kar paati box offis par

 Now the news is coming that Randeep Hooda is asking for Rs 11 crore to play the role of Sarabjit
 saath hi ye bhi charchaa ho rahaa he ki ab bhi filmkaar randeep se baatcheet kar rahe hai or agar wo film ke bajet ke anusaar mehtaanaa lene ko raji hue to wo is film kaa hissaa rah sakate hai
 But a question arises that if Randeep asked for 11 crores, why did he? Because sometimes when actors do not feel like doing a film, then they ask extravagantly money so that the producer does not chase them repeatedly to do the film and if Randeep has really asked for 11 crores, is it justified, because No film in the name of Randeep could do business of 11 crores at the box office
 lekin ek sawaal uthta he ki randeep ne agar 11 karod kii maang kii to kyon kii? kyonki kabhi kabhi actors kaa jab man nahin hota kisi film ko karne kaa tab wo ootpataang paise maangate hai taaki nirmaataa film karne ke liye unka baar baar peechha na kare or agar vaaki main randeep ne 11 karod maange hai to kya ye jaij mehtaanaa he, kyonki randeep ke naam par koi film 11 karod kaa bijanas nahin kar paati box offis par

 Ratan Rajput's journey ended on Saturday after spending a month in Bigg Boss house
 ratan bahut hi mithaas or jindidili ke saath big bos ke ghar main ai thim
 Ratan, who played a strong character on television, also showed his will power in the show
 khaas yah ki ratan kaa adhiktar samay jahannum main hi niklaa he or unka sabake hi saath bahut hi milansaar ravaiya bhi rahaa
 She tried to give her best in every task
 ratan ne us samay sabakaa dil jeet liya tha jab unhen do ghante tak gobar main baithne kaa task diya gaya
 Ratan was criticized for this decision but she remained firm on her decision
 unhone apni team ko jeet bhi dilaai
 When there was a period of fighting and quarreling in the house, Ratan was still calm and far from all the trouble
 ghar se baahar hone par ratan ne kaha, “big bos se mujhe aisa anubhav mila he, jise main taumr apane saath rakhuungi
 i am glad that i left my hesitation behind and did something that i will remember
 main ghar ke sabhi sadasyon miss karuungi, khaskar eli, apurva or shilpa
 i hope that only one of them wins
 ” Angry over not getting party tickets, several prominent local leaders of Congress and BJP have jumped into the electoral fray, which can cause trouble for both parties in Delhi civic elections

 Wait till the day of return

 - The life-size picture of Narendra Modi smiling is seen on the outer wall of bjp's publicity control room in Patna's New Dak Bungalow Road locality
 bheetar hedset lagaae log apane-apane cubicals main baithe lagaataar microphone par baat kar rahe hai
 One of them, Ashish Kumar, 20 years old wearing blue jeans and a brown shirt, is taking information from the operator of a BJP video van in Gaya district
 ve puch rahe hai, ''jab modi ji ke bhaashan kaa record chalaaya to kitne log aae?unki kya pratikriya thi? kitne stikar or modi mukhute baante gaye? kya jenerator or elidi screen kaam kar rahe hai?” or har sawaal ke baad ve jawaab ke liye kuch der rukate hai
 In the BJP video chariot, their colleagues have a mobile phone app that allows information of photos and number of crowds to the control room within minutes
 is jaankaree kaa rath ke video trekking upkaran se milan kiya jaataa he taaki control room main fouran sahi jaankaree mil sake
 The BJP has launched this electronic campaign for all 40 Lok Sabha seats in Bihar
 paanch saal pehle bijepi nitish kumaar kii junior partner thi
 She was given 15 parliamentary seats, winning 12
 lekin 2014 main bijepi morche par aage he
 She is contesting 30 seats in Bihar
 party ke ek varisht netaa kehete hai, ''bihar main chunavi takkar 1995 se hi sirf lalu banaam nitish rahi he
 So when we 13 percent our vote of 2009
 93 pratishat ko 30 pratishat tak le ja paaenge tabhi 40 main se 20 yaa usase adhik siten jeet sakate hai
 There is a need to try hard for this
 ”bihar main bijepi ke prachaar kii dotarafa ranneeti he
 One, the party's Bihar in-charge Dharmendra Pradhan and Legislature Party leader Sushil Kumar Modi have tried a new social engineering
 unhone dharmik pratikon ko alag rakhkar pichhadi jatiyon ko golband karne or nae saamaajik sameekaran banane kii koshish kii he
 Secondly, the party has created a comprehensive election management system through its central control room in Patna called Rajya Sabha MP R
K
 ke
 Sinha and his son Rituraj operate
 pradhan netaaon or baikaroom boij ke bich sampark sutara hai
 The impact of both these strategies is visible on the ground
 lok janashakti party (algepi) sahit party ke sahyogiyon kaa chota-sa network bhi is nae saamaajik sameekaran ko aage le jane main kargar sabit ho rahaa he
 LJP leader Ram Vilas Paswan and Rashtriya Lok Samata Party's OBC leader Upendra Kushwaha will draw as much Dalit and backward votes from Nitish Kumar's Janata dal-united (JD-U)
 nitish ke purv sahyogi kushvaha kii khaskar koiri jati main acchhee paith he
 Koiri and Kurmi have been the mainstay of Nitish ever since Lalu Prasad Yadav broke away from Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) in 1994
 ye donon hi obisi jatiyaan hai
 Kushwaha and Paswan will also work in the expansion of the BJP in Bihar and the acceptance of the BJP will also increase among other ideological-based parties, which Nitish described as a political untouchable after Modi's arrival
 bijepi ne saat loksabhaa siten paswan ke liye or teen kushvaha ke liye chodi hai
 The bjp's plan for social expansion in Bihar is not new but it was less expected that it would further distribute the caste-divided society of Bihar
 diggaj samaajawaadee netaa karpuri thakur ne 1970 ke dashak main pichhadi jatiyon ke liye sambhavit aarakshan ke bheetar aarakshan kii baat karke atipichdi jatiyon kii shrenee kii avadharana ko aage badhaayaa tha
 Lalu Prasad Yadav used it for his own benefit in the '90s and later Nitish made it more sharper by giving 20 per cent reservation in panchayats for the backward
 nitish ne atipichhadon main bhi haashie par rahane vaale tabakon ke prati lakshith kalyaan kaarykram chalaakar lalu ke pichhadaa-musalmaan-yadav or paswan ke dalit vot bank main send laga di
 Nitish was just 3 before his opponents came into action
 8 pratishat kurmiyon ke netaa se behad taqatvar ban gaye
 Then he also got the basis of bjp's upper caste vote bank
 desh nahin, jati pehlein loksabhaa chunaavon main nitish ke khilaaf purv sahyogi bijepi apane sahyogiyon kii marfat soshal ejineering aajamaa rahi he
 a senior party strategist explains, "in the society of Bihar divided into castes, the vision of 'country first' will not get votes
 hamen nitish or lalu kii jaateey raajnneeti kii kaat pesh kerani hogi or vahi ham kar rahe hai
 “the strategy is simple: create a new social alliance of different castes, use it to get an electoral majority, and then turn it into a permanent social support base
 bihar kii raajnneeti main jati kaa asar itnaa prabhavi he ki modi yahaan apane bhaashanon main yadavon sahit sabhi obisi jatiyon ko aakarshith karne ke liye khud ko nixsancoach pichhadi jati kaa bataa rahe hai
 The party did not shy away from including those who have been fiercely opposed to it, such as RKD MP in the Rajya Sabha Ramkripal Yadav in Pataliputra against Lalu's daughter Misa
 ek bijepi netaa kehete hai, ''jeetne kii kaabiliyat hi ekmaatr yogyata he
 "lalu and Nitish also remind of their days of poverty in response to Modi
 lalu votaron ko yaad dilaate hai ki ve bhi chaay or bakrii kaa doodh bechaa karte the, to nitish khud ko 'bahut maamuli aadmi’ or 'gaanv ke ek maamuli vaidya kaa betaa’ bataa rahe hai
 However, despite bjp's attempts to make a dent, Nitish can save a large part of his backward vote bank
 lalu bhi yadavon ko apane paksh main golband karne main kaamyaab ho sakate hai lekin ve apni sahyogi congress ko shaayad yah vot na dilava paaen
 The BJP is also trying to retain its original base of upper caste Bhumihars and Brahmins in its favor
 idhar, patna ke kol centre main ashish kumaar ko jab duusari taraf se yah bataaya gaya ki gaanv waalon ne recorded bhaashan ko baar-baar bajaane par jor diya to ve tahaakaa lagane lagate hai
 Like Ashish, a third-year BSC student, BJP has given 100 days of work to its Bihar campaign for about 100 people
 unki team roj aath ghante do paaliyon main kaam karti he
 His job is mainly to monitor the network of video vans and volunteers which the party has been using at various levels since December
 mobile sandeshrajya ke kul 243 vidhansabha kshetron main harek main ek video vine har roj saat jagahon par rukati he or har jagah vishaal elidi parade par modi kaa 25 minute ke bhaashan kaa video chalaaya jaataa he
 The essence of the speech is how Modi wants to take Bihar on the path of development
 ve bihar ke vishaal jal sansaadhan kii baat karte hai or sawaal karte hai ki phir rajya ko andhra pradesh se machhlee kyon mangani padati he
 Nitish, considered unmatched Chief Minister till last year, is now feeling lonely
 ek varisht jedy(you) netaa bataate hai, ''unki sabase badi chintaa loksabhaa chunaav nahin he, balki iskaa unki sarkaar par padane vaala apshakuni saaya he
 The JD (U) has only 115 mlas in the 243-member assembly
 mukhyamantri ne bijepi ke vidhayakon santosh kumaar or avinaash kumaar singh ko loksabhaa kaa tikat de diya he or in logon se vidhansabha sadsyta se istipha dilava kar vidhansabha main bijepi kii sankhya gata di he
 Apart from this, two other BJP mlas Amarnath Gami and Vijay Mishra may also not vote against Nitish
 isi tarah algepi ke ekmaatr vidhayak jakir hossain khan bhi farvari main jedy(you) main shaamil ho gaye hai
 Apart from this, four of the 13 RJD mlas are identified as separate factions in the assembly, they too have not returned to the RJD
 is vivaadaaspad pahal se alpamat sarkaar ko raahat mili
 Thus the total strength of the House is currently 237 and the government has the support of four Congress mlas, four Independents and one CPI MLA
 nitish ko apane atipichade-mahadalit-pasmanda muslim vot bank par bharosa he
 Their biggest challenge is to convince voters of their relevance
 unka achaanak yah daawa modi se apni barabari karne kaa hi nuskhaa he ki sansad main ek din bhi na bitaane vaale ke mukaable ve pradhanmantri banane ke zyada yogya hai
 Convicted in the fodder scam, Lalu Prasad has fielded wife Rabri Devi from Saran, from where he won in 2009
 jamaanat par chhootane ke baad se ve nitish or paswan se adhik sabhaaon ko sambodhit kar chuke hai
 They are trying to win the trust of Muslims who are swinging between congress-rjd-ncp alliance and Nitish
 argedy gathjod ne aath musalmaan or 10 yadav ummidavaar khadey kiye hai taaki lalu ke charchit emwai (muslim-yadav) gathjod ko phir hasil kiya ja sake
 a senior Yadav leader explains the party's strategy, "it is important to know which group will not vote for you
" aise samoohon par samay barabaad karnaa bekaar he
 "lalu or Nitish may be feeling the danger of breaking their base, while Paswan would have hoped to strengthen himself by stopping Modi
 apane sahyogiyon ke jariye ab bijepi nitish ke khilaaf ranneetik soshal ejineering kaa istemaal kar rahi he

 america ke up-rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar ben rods ne mangalvaar ko 'yatra kaa purvavlokan' naam se bulaai gaye samvaadadaata sammelan main kaha ki donon deshon ke bich jatil itihaas ko dekhte hue, "is nyote ne hamen aashcharyachakit kar diya tha
 " unhone kaha, america or bharat ke bich or hamaare logon ke bich kai samanthaayen hai
 But our history has been quite complicated, due to which there was no possibility that the American President would sit with the Indian leaders for the Republic Day celebrations of India
 rods ne kaha, isliye mujhe lagata he ki raashtrapati obama ne is nyote ko sweekaar karte samay garv mahasoos kiya tha
 i think he saw this invitation as a successful meeting with Prime Minister Modi
 rods ne bataaya ki obama ne abhi tak kisi bhi desh ke rashtriya samaaroh main bhaag nahin liya he
 He said, this is a unique ceremony, it has given a historic moment to India and America and has given importance to Republic Day in India
 mere khyaal se iskaa bada sankethik mahatv he
 That is why he was very happy to accept this invitation
 modi or obama ke bich sambandhon par baat karte hue rods ne kaha ki modi ke chunaav ke baad pehali baatcheet main unhone kuch samanthaayen dekhin, ki kaise unke prachaar abhiyaanon ne apane-apane deshon main raajnneeti main prachlit tareekon ko badal diya tha
 He said, so i think in this conversation he shared the experiences of his election campaigns, and during the Prime Minister's visit i think a good friendship was formed between them

 Ram Rahim, who was imprisoned in the rape case, was ruled by a special CBI court on Friday in the journalist Ram Chandra Chhatrapati murder case
 adaalat ne gurmeet ram rahim ko doshi qaraar diya
 Significantly, journalist Ram Chandra Chhatrapati was the same journalist who first brought the truth of Ram Rahim before the whole world
 unhone sirsa main hue do sadhviyon ke saath hue rape kii khabar ko apane akhbaar 'puraa sach' main chapa tha
 After this news was published, people of Ram Rahim used to threaten journalist Ram Chandra Chhatrapati for the day
 iske baavjood patrkaar ram chandra chhatrapati nirbhik hokar ram rahim ke khilaaf likhte rahe
 Then on October 24, 2002, journalist Chhatrapati was attacked by some unknown people outside the house
 unki goliyon se bhun kar hatya kar di gai
 After the murder of his father, his son Anshul wandered from place to place for justice, but finally today the court is going to pronounce judgment in this case
 akhbaar puraa sach ne kya khulaasa kiya tha ram rahim ke bare main
 
 
 Let me tell you that the incident of rape by Sadhvi by Ram Rahim was suppressed for several days
 is puri ghatana kaa khulaasa jis gumnaam chitthee se hua wo patrkaar chhatrapati ne apane akhbaar main prakashit kii thi
 At that time, the letter was sent to many institutions including the then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Chief Justice Punjab and Haryana High Court
 teen pej kii chitthee haath aane ke baad patrkaar chhatrapati ne ram rahim ke bare main apane akhbaar main chapa tha
 a few days later, the Punjab and Haryana High Court took cognizance of this letter and ordered the District and Sessions Judge of Sirsa to conduct an inquiry
 jiske baad jaj ne yah jaanch sibiai ko saunpi
 When was the case registered? 
 
 punjab or haryana hoicourt ke chitthee par sangyaan lene ke baad disambar 12, 2002 ko sibiai kii chandigarh unit ne is maamle main dhara 376, 506 or 509 ke tahat maamla darj karte hue investigation kii
 Then Ram Rahim was also jailed in this case
 lambey samay se yah mana jaataa rahaa he kivivaahit jodeko mil-julkar hi apni sari jimmedaari kaa nirvaah karnaa chahie
 In recent decades, there has also been a belief that men should also help women in domestic work
 parantuek nae shodh kaa nishkarshaisa he, jisapar aap shaayad hi aasaani se yakeen kar saken
 The bottom line of research is that if you want to avoid divorce, then let the wife do all the household chores
 yah adhyayan langik samanta kii vakaalat karne waalon ko pareshaan kar saktaa he, lekin shodhakartaaon ne paaya he ki ghar ke kaamkaaj main haath bantane vaale ‘aadhunik’ danpatiyon main talaak kii dar adhik he
 On the other hand, the rate of segregation in the houses where women bear all the responsibilities of household work is low
 norge main kiye gaye ek adhyayan main yah baat saamne ai he ki sirf mahilaon ke bajaay gharelu kaamkaaj main baraabar kii hissedari nibhaane vaali danpatiyon main talaak kii dar 50 fisadi adhik paayi gai he
 The research report states that there is often a lack of clarity about the role of husband and wife at home and outside
 isliye donon ko ek-duusare ke kaam main taang nahin adaani chahie
 Lead researcher Thomas Hensen said, "if both of them do the housework together, then there will be more quarrel between them, because both will want to work on their own according to each other
 ’unhone kaha, ‘aadhunik danpatiyon main mahilaayein bhi ucch shikshit hai or acha khaasaa kamaati hai, jo apane jeevanasathi par unki nirbharta ko kam karata he
 In such a situation, if there is a quarrel about domestic work, then they can live comfortably even after getting a divorce

 Anna Hazare has disbanded his team
 anshan samaapti ke baad hui baithak main yah faisla liya gaya
 Anna has made it clear in her blog that there will be no hunger strike now
 saath hi anna ne likhaa he ki vah puure desh main ab daura karenge
 Read Anna's blog: Janlokpal law is not ready to form government
 kahaan tak baar-baar anshan karte rahoge
 Now leave the fast and give option to the people of the country
 yah maang janata se badhati gai
 i also thought that the corruption of the country cannot be reduced by today's government
 kaaran, sarkaar kii manshaa hi nahin he
 Corruption will be eliminated by Janlokpal law
 yah deshavaasiyon kii aashaa thi
 But a year and a half passed
 baar-baar janata ne andolan karne ke baad bhi sarkaar janalokapal kanoon laane ko taiyaar nahin
 Giving people choices by searching for good people
 yah acha rasta he
 i thought so
 lekin hoga kaise? yah mere saamne prashn he
 i openly raised a question at Jantar Mantar in front of people talking about giving me options
 aap vikalp kii baat karte hai
 i will tour across the country
 logon ko jaagruk karuunga achche sadaachari, rashtriya drushtikon he, saamaajik drushtikon he, seva bhav he aise log sansad main nahin jaaenge tab tak badlaav nahin aayega
 i approve of it but -1
 aise logon kii khoj karne kaa tarika kya hoga?2
 a party has to be formed to give an alternative
 us party banaate samay party sadsy chunane kaa tarika kya hoga?3
 Today, most parties put up boards
 sabhasad nodani (registration) kaa kaam chaalu he
 Be corrupt, be a punk, be an adulteress, be a looter and make a member even after not seeing them
 is prakaar ke sabhasad banaae to is andolan kaa kya hoga?4
 i will not make myself into a party
 main chunaav nahin laduunga
 But i will definitely try to give options before the public
 5
 Today, more than 10 to 15 crore rupees are spent for an election
 desh ko vikalp dene ke liye itnaa paisa kahaan se laaenge?6
 After getting elected in the election, their intelligence is overturned, so what is the option? The reason is that when choosing the public, it is a good candidate while giving it
 lekin kursi kaa gun-dharm he ki kai logon kii buddhi palat jaati he or swaarth ke kaaran vah bhrashtachar karne lagate he
 Like it is seen in many parties today
 uske bare main kya soch he? aise logon kii mantering karne kaa tarika kya he?7
 Today, humanity and humanity are being exploited and the government is not stopping it
 yah desh ke liye bada khatra he
 What would be the option? 8
 jantar mantar par jo hajaaron log aae the unako team ne poocha ki vikalp dena chahie yaa nahin or sabhi ne haath upar uthaae
 That's a good thing lekin sirf jantar mantar desh nahin he
 The country is very large
 unki bhi raay lenaa jaruri he
 i expect desh main 6 lakh gaanv hai
 The gram sabhas of all these villages have to pass their suggestion that we ask for alternatives
 isliye hamaari gramsabha kaa suzav aapako bhejte hai ki sansad main achche log jaae is baat se hamaari sahmati he
 The gram sabha is not possible where the person signs the form and says that we are ready for the option
 9
 Just like the suggestion of Gram Sabha in the village, similarly the ward council and the mohalla sabha will also have to be suggested in the Municipal Council, Municipality, Mahapalika
 tab spasht hoga ki loksabhaa main achche logon ko bhejne kii janata kii taiyaari he
 If this happens, i will travel in the country for the next year and a half and wake the countrymen
 janata se hi apil karuunga ki loksabhaa main bhejne ke liye chaaritrasheel ummidavaar kii khoj karo
 After the discovery, our workers will go for their service, character, love of the nation, their work
 unki jaanch karenge
 After that there will be selection
 maine maharashtra main yah prayog kiya he
 i elected 12 assembly members
 usamen se 8 log chunakar aae the
 When i talked about giving an option to send a good candidate to Parliament, many people announced that Anna had become zero
 main to pehle se hi zero hum, mandir main rahata hum, na dhan na daulat, na koi pad, abhi bhi zamin par baithkar saadi sabji-roti khaataa hum
 It is already zero and will be zero till the end
 jo pehle se zero he usko zero kya banaaege? jisko kahana he wo kahata rahe mujhe koi fark nahin padataa
 Aaj Tak has written at least 5 books to discredit me in 25 years
 kai akhbaar waalon ne badanaami ke liye agralekh (sampadakeey) likhe he
 But the faq of the fakir man did not diminish
 is faqiri kaa aannad kitna hota he? yah badanaami karne vaale logon ko faqir bananaa padegaa tak samaj main aayega
 One thing is good that i am condemned
 utani hi janata or desh kii seva karne kii shakti badi
 Today, at the age of 75, there is the same enthusiasm as when working 35 years ago
 desh kaa bhrashtachar kam karne ke liye janalokapal kanoon banavaane ke liye kai baar andolan hue
 There were 4 fasts
 lekin sarkaar maanane ke liye taiyaar nahin isliye team ne nirnay liya anshan rokkar vikalp dena padegaa
 The movement to demand Janlokpal from the government stopped but the movement has not ended
 pehle sarkaar se janalokapal kanoon kii maang karte rahe
 The government does not do this, so it was decided to start the movement to select good people from the public and send them to Parliament and make Janlokpal
 agar janata ne peeche deb saal se saath diya, vah kaayam rahaa to janata ke chune hue charitrasheel log sansad main bhejenge
 And Jan Lokpal will make laws like Right to Reject, Right to Gram Sabha, Right to Recall
 or aane vaale 5 saal main bhrashtachar mukt bharat kaa nirmaan paksh or party se nahin jan sahbhaag se karenge
 The 2014 election is the last chance for the public to create a corruption-free country
 is chunaav ke baad phir se aisa mauka milanaa mushkil he
 Because, the country has woken up at the moment abhi nahin to kabhi nahin
 i have told repeatedly that my life has been devoted to society and country service
 is vakt janata kaa saath nahin mila to nuksaan anna kaa nahin janata kaa hoga
 Anna is a Fakir and will remain a Fakir till death
 maine achche log chunakar sansad main bhejne kaa vikalp diya he
 But i will not join the party
 chunaav bhi nahin laduunga
 i will rejoin my work in Maharashtra by giving Janlokpal law to the public
 party nikaalane vaale logon ko bhi maine bataaya he
 Even after forming the party, this movement remained
 pehle andolan main sarkaar se janalokapal kanoon maang rahe the
 Now by continuing the movement, with the support of the public, send good people to the parliament and make laws
 dil or dimag main satta na rahe, raaj kaaran na rahe, yah desh kii deshavaasiyon kii seva samajhakar karo
 If power and money come to mind, then there will be no difference between the other party and your party
 jis din mujhe dikhaai degaa ki desh kii samaaj kii seva dur gai or sirf satta or paisa kaa prayaas ho rahaa he
 i will stop on the same day
 aage nahin badhunga
 Because i have thought of giving options for the betterment of society and country
 meraa jivan unheen kii bhalaai ke liye he
 Today, we have finished the work of Team Anna
 janalokapal ke kaary ke liye team anna bana gai thi
 It is decided not to have relation with the government
 is kaaran aaj se team anna naam se chalaa hua kaary samaapt ho gaya he or ab team anna samiti bhi samaapt hui he
 The Union Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare and Anupriya Patel, the leader of the Apna Dal, has targeted the upheaval in the Samajwadi Party for the last few days

 The days of college are different and if we talk about campus food, then the taste of each student is remembered even after leaving the college
 jaane aise lajij or bajet main aane vaale behtareen khaane ke bare main:1
 chole-bhuture: This Punjabi food is ordered first in the college canteen, when lunch time is hungry
 2
 Stuffed Paratha: If you want to eat enough in the budget, then the hot stuffed paratha with yogurt and pickle is the first to remember

 4
 frid rice:chaaval va sabjayon kaa poshan or khaane main aasaani ke saath chinis food kaa feel

 megi:aksar canteen main bevakt pahanchane par khaanaa taiyaar nahin miltaa he, aise main bhukh mitaane ke liye jo sabase zyada madad karti he wo he megi
 It is the most hit food among college and hostel dwellers

 10
 bread pakora :college ke dhabon main chaay ke saath bread pakora - shaayad hi kisi ne yah swaad miss kiya hoga
 11

 saal 1896 main 6 april ke din pehle aadhunik olympic khelon kii shuruyaat hui thi
 But who was the master mind behind it and because of which Olympic Games were started
 jaaniye
 
 
 Games developed in ancient times with competition between warriors in times of peace
 daud, mukkebaaji, kushti or rathon kii daud sainik prashikshan kaa hissaa hua karte the
 Among them, the best performing warriors showed their stamina in competitive sports
 yaadon main kho chukin parveen babi kaa aaj he janmdinsamachar agency 'aaraaie novosti' ke anusaar pracheen olympic khelon kaa aayojan 1200 saal purv yoddha-khilaadiyon ke bich hua tha
 Although the first official Olympics were held in 776 BC, the last time it was held was in 394 AD 
 iske baad rome ke samraat theodosis ne ise murti puja vaala utsav qaraar dekar is par pratibandh laga diya gaya
 The world's biggest sporting event is starting at the Rio Olympics 2016
 After this, these games were forgotten for about one and a half years
 haalanki madhyakaal main abhijatya virgon ke bich alag-alag tarah kii pratispardhaaen hoti raheen
 But they could not get the status of sports event
 kul milakar rome or greece jaisi prabhutvaadi sabhyataaon ke abhaav main is kaal main logon ke paas khelon ke liye samay nahin tha
 Sakshi Malik, spoken in India Today # mindrocks16 - Rio's Bronze Medal changed My World This tradition of ancient times was revived with the development of a universal civilization in Europe in the 19th century
 iskaa shrey france ke abhijaat purush bairon piyare di kuvarten ko jaataa he
 Kuvarthen set two goals, one is to make the Games popular in his country and second, to mobilize all the countries for a peaceful competition
 teen logon se kii pyaar, lekin jeevanabhar avivaahit rahi parveen bobaikuvarten maanate the ki khel yudhon ko taalane ke sabase achche madhyam ho sakate hai
 Based on this hypothesis of Kuvarthen, for the first time in 1896, the modern Olympic Games were held in Athens, the capital of Greece
 shuruaati dashak main olympic andolan apane astitv ko bachaane ke liye sangharsh karata rahaa kyonki kuvarten kii is pariklpana ko kisi bhi badi shakti kaa saath nahin mil sakaa tha

 9 khelon ke 43 event is olympic main hue
 37,40,000 drachmus (greek currency) was spent in organizing these games
 43 pratiyogitaaon main pehali baar marathon daud ko bhi shaamil kiya gaya
 From 6 to 15 April 1896, the Games were held in Athens, the capital of Greece

 This number was more than the sum of the last three events
 saal 1930 ke berlin sanskaran ke saath to maanon olympic andolan main nai jivan shakti aa gai
 The continued competition at the social and political level made the Nazis a means of proving their superiority
 silver laane par sindhu ko cash or bmdablyoo, kenya kii goldmedalist ke gaanv electricity1950 ke dashak main soviet-america pratispardhaa ke khel ke maidan main aane ke saath hi olympic kii khyaati charam par pahunch gai
 After this, the game was never separated from politics
 khel keval raajnneeti kaa vishay nahin rahe
 They became an important part of politics
 chunki soviet sangh or america jaisi mahashaktiyaan kabhi nahin khule taur par ek duusare ke saath yuddh ke maidan main bhid nahin sakin
 So he made the Olympics a means to prove his superiority
 america ke purv raashtrapati jon epa

 On the 50th anniversary of the Soviet Union, the people did not want to lose to America at any cost
 isi kaa nateeja tha ki soviet athleton ne 50 swarna padakon ke saath kul 99 padak jite
 This number was one-third higher than the medals won by America
 saal 1980 main america or uske pashchim ke mitra rashtron ne 1980 ke moscow olympic main shirkat karne se inkaar kar diya
 The Soviet Union then boycotted the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics in order to settle the account

 He won 132 medals

 pandrah din tak chale olympic khelon ke dauraan china ne naa sirf apni shandaar mezbaani se logon kaa dil jeeta balki sabase zyaada swarna padak jeet kar bhi itihaas rachaa
 China topped the medal table for the first time

 rashtramandal khelon main ek hi pratibandhit padaarth ke istemaal ke liye nyeegeria ke duusare athlete ke pajitive paye jane se doping kaa doosraa maamla saamne aayaa
 About a day earlier, another Nigerian athlete was found positive in this test
 sijief adhyaksh mike fennell ne kaha ki baadha daud athlete samual okon ko mithailhexamine ke liye pajitive paaya gaya

 But i am sad to announce that another athlete has been found guilty of doping
 ’unhone kaha, ‘ab doosraa doping kaa pajitive maamla saamne aayaa he

 The CGF chief, however, denied that the doping team would test all Nigerian players and said it does not fall under the cgf's jurisdiction

 chunavi mausam main pradhanmantri narendra modi ne bollywood actor akshay kumaar ko die ek gaiyr raajnneetik intervyuu main bhi bade siyaasi sandesh de die
 In this interesting interview, Prime Minister Modi mentioned his political opponents in telling such sentences, which are being extracted with great implications
 intervyuu main piem modi ne jahaan gulamanbi aaazaad ko apana dost bataaya, vahiin apni dhur virdohi pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee ke bare main kaha ki ve unhen har saal kurte or mithai bhejti hai
 Whenever Prime Minister Narendra Modi has so far mentioned the leaders of the opposition, he has 'spoken' of his failures and flaws
 chunaav kii tapish jab apane charam par he, aise vakt main piem modi kaa apane virodhiyon kii tarif karnaa bade raajnneetik panditon ke bhi gale nahin utar rahaa
 Of course the PM will be friendly with many opposition leaders, but in the recent times, he has kept everyone on target
 is ‘gaiyr raajnneetik’ intervyuu main piem modi ne apni vipakshi netaaon se dosti ke kisse sunaae
 The PM said that was a long time ago
 tab main siem bhi nahin tha
 Then i went to Parliament for some work
 vahaan gulam nabi aaazaad or main bade dostana andaaj main gappe maar rahe the
 Seeing us talking like this, the media people said that you are an RSS person and how did you become friends with Azad
 iskaa gulam nabi aaazaad ne acha jawaab diya
 He said, look brother, you are not what you think
 shaayad family ke rup main ham sabhi dalon ke log jitne jude hue hai, wo aap log soch nahin sakate hai
 The manner in which PM Modi mentioned his anti-mamata Banerjee, political experts are extracting its big implications
 piem modi ne behad chaturaai se mamata banerjee se apane siyaasi tallukaat par kaha ki didi aaj bhi saal main ek-do kurte bhejti hai
 Like Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, Didi also sends sweets
 piem modi is dauraan ye taakid karnaa nahin bhoolatey ki ho saktaa he ki isse unhen chunaav main nuksaan ho
 The damage Modi is talking about here is actually less and more profit
 pashchim bengal kii kul 42 main teen charnon main 10 siton par chunaav ho chuke hai
 Elections are to be held in 32 seats in the remaining four phases
 piem modi bakhubi jaanate hai ki unke is bayaan se bengal main bada sandesh jayega
 Modi has been in the 'hit list' of Mamata Banerjee's election campaign so far
 bengal se baithkar dilli main nishaanaa sadhate hue didi kai baar piem modi ko aade haath le chuki hai 
 It is clear that Mamata's propaganda has been around Modi's opposition
 mamata banerjee puure bengal main modi kaa virodh karke hi apane paksh main hawa banane kaa prayaas kar rahi hai
 In such a situation, Modi's saying that Didi sends him kurtas and sweets every year, weakens Mamata Banerjee's claim of Modi's opposition
 modi ke bayaan kaa ek pahalu or he
 At present, bjp's condition is not like 2014
 tamaam survey main bhi aisa hi anumaan lagaaya ja rahaa he
 The entire opposition is trying to surround them on issues like GST, demonetisation, and Rafale
 upi main basapa-sapa kii bemail dosti bhi modi lahar main palitha lagaati dikh rahi he
 That is, this time the bjp's claim of 73+ in UP and 300+ in the country is looking weak
 aise main agar 23 may ke baad sarkaar banane main kuch number kam pade to bijepi ke paas jod-tod kii kuch to gunjaaish rahe
 Modi's soft speech for Didi is also seen to be associated with this scope
 yahaan ye gaur karne vaali baat he ki pashchim bengal main abhi 32 siton par chunaav hone hai
 a total of 8 seats are to be held on April 29 in the state on April 29 in Behrampur, Krishnanagar, Ranaghat, Bardhaman East, bardhaman-durgapur, Asansol, Bolpur, Birbhum
 vahiin paanchave charan main saat siton bang, barrackpore, haavda, uluberia, shrirampur, hughali, arambagh par, chathe charan main 8 siton taamluk, kanti, ghatal, jhargram, medinipur, purniya, bankura or vishnupur main chunaav honge
 a total of 9 seats in the seventh and last phase are to be contested in Dum Dum, Barasat, Basirhat, Jayanagar, Mathurapur, Diamond Harbor, Jadavpur, Kolkata South, Kolkata North
 yani bengal kii asli pikchar abhi baaki he
 And in the beginning itself, Modi has made a very clever bet on Mamta Banerjee by speaking of kurtas and sweets in a non-political interview

 Shahrukh's film 'zero' is getting good response from UP and Bihar
 salmaan khan kii 'res 3' or aamir khan kii 'thags of hindostaan' ke baad ab shahrukh ko bahut bada jhatka laga he

 Shah Rukh Khan's 'zero' was expected to break a record opening
 film ko bahut achche rivyuu nahin mil paae hai
 Shahrukh Khan's acting in 'zero' is being liked, but the story and directions of the film are being told weakly
 shahrukh khan (shah Rukh Khan), katrina caff (katrina Kaif) or anoushka sharma (anushka Sharma) kii 'jiro (zero)' bharat main lagbhag 4,400 screen par relies hui he jabaki film videsh main lagbhag 1,500 screens par relies kii gai he
 In this way, the first weekend is going to be very important for 'zero' as the budget of the film is around 200 crores
 bataaya jaataa he
 Anand z to 'zero'
 raay ne diarect kiya he, or isse pehle ve 'tanu vaids manu 1-2' or 'ranjhanaa' jaisi superhit filmein diarect kar chuke hai
 But the film was mid-budget, and was a success at the box office with strong storytelling
 lekin 'jiro' is morche par thodi kamjor najar aa rahi he

 inputs agency se bhi Salman Khan is a big heart salmaan kaa dil hi kuch aisa he, jab kisi ko pasand karata he to uske liye kuch bhi kar saktaa he
 Yuvraj Singh will definitely believe this
 aakhir beemaari se ubar rahe yuvi kaa dil jo khush kar diya he salmaan ne
 Salman is like Robinhood not only in reel but also in real
 fark bas itnaa he ki real life main wo apni kamai, apano main lutaaney main jaraa der nahin lagaate
 Yuvraj Singh became a witness this time of his generosity
 apni beemaari kaa videsh me ilaaj kara rahe yuvaraj is vakt salmaan ke badppan se hairaan honge
 It is reported that Salman has given the amount that Yuvraj had to get in the treatment of Yuvraj
 khabaron kii maane to ek multivitamin tablet banane vaali company ko yuvaraj indorse kar rahe the
 But in the middle shoot itself, Yuvraj came to know about the disease and he left the unfinished shoot of the advertisement and went abroad for treatment

 Salman Khan knew that the ad was crowned by the crown prince, he also knew that due to the compulsion, Yuvraj had to leave the ad in the middle
 lihaaja bade dil vaale dabang ne vigyaapan se mili rakam yuvaraj ke ilaaj ke liye de di
 Although Yuvraj has no shortage of money, but in this way of giving Salman money, his love and respect for Yuvraj is clearly visible in his heart
 yuvaraj ke liye bhi salmaan kisi bade bhai se kam nahin, iskaa saboot wo salmaan ke dushman shahrukh ke saamne bhi de chuke hai
 Now that Yuvraj is ill, Salman is praying for him, by completing Yuvraj's incomplete advertisement and giving him his earnings, Salman has proved that he never stays behind in the friendship of friends in Bollywood

 jammu-kashmir main dhara 370 ke praavdhaanon ko hataae jane ke masale par sansad main khulkar virodh darj kara chuke janata dal united(jadyu) ke sur ab naram pad gaye hai
 This BJP ally has now said that when the important provisions of Article 370 are removed despite opposition in Parliament, it should be accepted now

 Why Jyadusutra on the backfoot is telling that the way the government's decision on section 370 got wide public support in the country
 yahaan tak ki mukhya vipakshi dal congress ke kai netaaon ne bhi party line se pare hatakar iskaa samarthan kiya
 With this, Janata Dal United felt that if she still takes a stand of protest then it will be a thing against public opinion
 jiskaa aage chalakar nuksaan uthaanaa pad saktaa he
 At the same time, there may be a rift in the alliance
 sutron kaa kahana he ki dhara 370 par baagi rukh apnaane ke peeche jadyu kii majaburi thi
 In fact, JDU also gets some Muslim votes, despite its proximity to BJP due to the secular image of Nitish Kumar in Bihar
 chunki kashmir muslim dominated aria he
 In such a situation, JDU felt that the feelings of local Muslims may also be associated with Kashmiri Muslims
 is naate iskaa samarthan karte hue nahin dikhnaa chahie
 JDU also took a similar stand on triple talaq
 sutron ke mutabik is vajah se kashmir ke masale par jadyu kaa bijepi se vipareet rukh rahaa
 It is also being said that JDU adopted a strategy to help both the factions behind the first protest and later to soften the stance
 kaha ja rahaa he ki isse jadyu ne apane alpsankhyak voters ko bhi sandesh diya ki vah dhara 370 ke khilaaf he, vahiin duusari taraf baad main rukh naram kar yah bhi jataa diya ki vah desh ke mood kaa virodh bhi nahin karnaa chaahati
 JDU National General Secretary RCP Singh has now demanded the government to work for the betterment of employment, development etc
 with a solution to all the problems present in Jammu and Kashmir

 Mumbai Indians have added Aljari Joseph as a replacement for the injured New Zealand fast bowler Adam Milne, which proved to be a boon for him
 vaise abhi tak joseph ne westeindies kii taraf se tii-20 international main debyue nahin kiya he
 Earlier, Aljari Joseph had played only seven domestic T20 matches, with 9 wickets in his name

 is pariyojna kaa nirmaan kar rahi agency sutluj jal vidyut nigam kii karypranali ke chalate sthaneey janata main kaaphi aakrosh he
 Alam is that the people of Pinder Valley have taken to the streets
 is pariyojna ke khilaaf gathit bhuswami sangharsh samiti kaa kahana he ki nigam ko na to sthaneey janata ke sawaalon kii chintaa he or na paryaavaran se jude pahaluon kii
 The project is environmentally sensitive and located in Seismic Zones 4-5
 paryaavaran mantralay bhi pariyojna ke sambhavit asar par sawaal uthaa chukaa he
 On the other hand, without taking the public into confidence, the project authorities are pretending to have a public hearing and the company is in a hurry to complete the work despite heavy opposition
 vah yah bataane kii sthiti main nahin he ki baandh kii gaharaai va oonchai kitni hogi or isse paryaavaran par kya asar padegaa
 The only tributary of Pinder Ganga has survived, which has no project so far
 mandakini ghati main baandhon ke asar ko dekh chuke pinder ghati ke log ab is baandh ke khilaaf mukhar ho gaye hai
 They demand that this only dam-free river in the state be allowed to flow continuously
 devsari jal vidyut pariyojna se pinder ghati ke 26 gaanv prabhavit honge
 The environmental public hearing of the project proposed by the Central and Himachal government joint venture Satulj Jal Vidyut Nigam could not be completed in three years due to the opposition from the local public
 13 aktubar, 2009 ko kulsari main yojit pariyojna ke liye pehali jan sunwaayee joardaar virodh ke baad sthagit ho gai
 The same fate of the second public hearing held on 22 July 2010 at Block Headquarters Dewal

 Within were only supporters of the project
 pariyojna se sidhe taur par prabhavit hone vaale sarkot, soding, devsari, purna, devalagad, tharali, pathaani, silodi, pingarh, chapad, cyle, talaar, gatkot, chairanga or lausri gaanv ke log apane bhavishya ko lekar chintit hai
 Of these, there are half a dozen villages whose existence will end after the construction of the project
 kendriya paryaavaran mantralay kii sweekru t antim paryaavaran moolyankan report ke mutabik, is baandh ke nirmaan main 223
 36 hectares of land will be acquired and its water storage area will be spread over 1,138 square kilometers
 is pariyojna kii vajah se 500 se adhik parivaar prabhavit honge
 With the impact on water, forest, land, local ecology, environment and life, there are other fears of experts about this dam proposed amid sensitive geographical conditions
 pinder ghati kaa yah samoochaa madhya himalayan kshetra bukampiy drushti se samvedansheel he or sismik jone 4-5 main aata he
 The Geological Survey of India report clearly states that in areas where large dams were built, the problem of erosion and erosion has increased manifold as geological movement has intensified
 tehri baandh nirmaan ke baad pratapnagar or bhilangna ke hajaaron parivaar is sankat ko jhel rahe hai
 After the construction of the dam, the problem of landslides and rocks has increased in about 130 villages of Tehri district
 tehri baandh se lage kshetron main badal fatne se beete teen varsh main 30 se adhik logon kii maut hui he
 Now a similar fear surrounds the people of Pinder region
 2010 main bhi is kshetra ke kai gaanv bhuskhalan kii samasya se prabhavit rahe
 The main tunnel of the main reservoir to be built at Nandkesari under Devsari project will be passed under the villages Panagad, Sunau, Devalgad, Suna, Tharali, Kunnipartha, Chepadu, Nandakesari
 aise main pani ke baari dabaav se tay he ki is kshetra main bhugarbheey halchal badhane ke saath hi bhuskhalan bhi tej ho jayega
 In 2004, the leakage in the main tunnel of Dhauliganga hydropower project in Dharchula of Pithoragarh, the frontier district of the state, destroyed the houses of 18 families of Siyankuri village and destroyed the fields and barns completely
 yahi nahin, darjanon gharon main daraaren pad gai thim
 On the other hand, the report was also sent to the Union Environment Ministry citing the final hearing of the three environmental hearings as successful
 report ke aadhaar par mantralay kii paryaavaran moolyankan samiti ne pariyojna ko hari jhdi dikhaa di he, jabaki iskaa virodh kar rahe matu jansanghathan or bhuswami sangharsh samiti kaa kahana he ki 20 janvari, 2011 ko hui jis jansunwaayee ko aakhri or saf l mana ja rahaa he, usamen baari sankhya main police tainaat kii gai thi
 Even the villagers who went to defend themselves were not allowed to speak
 nigam kii mantralay ko bheji gai report se bhi yah baat sabit hoti he, jisamen saaf likhaa he ki jan sunwaayee ke paksh main 13 logon ne apni baat rakhi
 The question is that the project whose public hearing could not be completed even in three years, in which 500 families from dozens of villages are being affected, how was it finalized after favoring only 13 people? Ironically, neither the voice of protest is reaching the Center nor the state government
 rajya sarkaar ne siyaasi malai ke chakkar main chunaav se pehle november main pariyojna ke liye bhoomi uplabdh karvaa di, lekin graminon ke sawaalon par maun he
 With this project, the centers of ancient faith along with life are also in crisis
 is kshetra main sthit karnaprayag iklauti aisi jagah he, jo ab tak baandhon ke prabhaav se achhuti thi
 But now he is also in trouble
 is baandh ke banane se deval se lekar paithani tak pinder nadi ke kinare based 200 pariwaron ke saamne aajeevika kaa sankat khadaa ho jayega, jo machhlee or anya prakritik sansadhano ke liye nadi par nirbhar hai
 The dense forests from Nandakesari to Paithani will end
 17
 Due to the 9 km long tunnel, Karnprayag will get imprisoned in Pindar river tunnel, because this tunnel will make the river waterless in about 20 km area
 nadi ke ujm se lekar karnaprayag tak 70 kimi ke kshetra main 24 jal vidyut pariyojnaayen nimarnadhin or prastaavit hai, jiske liye takreeban tees kilometre lambii surang banaai jaaegi
 Due to this, if not today, tomorrow the people of this place will have to be displaced
 himalayan paryaavaran shiksha santhaan, uttarkashi ke nideshak evam paryaavaranvid suresh bhai kehete hai ki pinder ghati main ban rahi yah surang bahut khatarnaak he
 Villages near which it will pass, there will be a risk of landslides
 pinder ghati main chal rahe andolan ke agua matu jansanghathan ke vimal bhai kaa kahana he ki rashtriya nadi ganga ke paanch prayaagon main pinder ganga hi ab tak nirbaadh bah rahi he
 At least one of the tributaries of the Ganges should be left intact
 bhuswami sangharsh samiti ke sanyojak madan mishra kehete hai ki yah andolan kaa hi asar he ki jahaan pehle adhikari keval 20 gaanvon ko prabhavit bataa rahe the, vahiin ab unhone yah sankhya 36 maan lee he
 The issue dominated during the elections
 makapa iske virodh main saamne aa chuki logon kaa kahana he ki agar devsari pariyojna kaa nirmaan hota he to puraani tehri ke baad ek or saanskrithik vividhta vaala kshetra jalmagn ho jayega

 Both work in a factory
 haalanki jab inke paas adhik sharaab ke liye paise nahin the to inhone lut kaa rasta chunaa
 They laid a trap on the way and thought that they would rob someone

 Dad left us at school

 i went to the restroom
 toilet main mujhe conductor ankal mil gaye
 There he was doing something wrong
 maine conductor ankal se poocha ki aap kya kar rahe hai
 So Conductor Uncle pulled me inside the bathroom
 maine kaha ki main aapaki shikaayat teacher ko kar duungaa
 So they grabbed me hard and cut the throat with a knife
 mujhe bahut tej dard ho rahaa tha
 i was choking
 sabakuch dhundhala dikhaai de rahaa tha
 i left, leaving my beloved mother
 apane pyaare papa ko chhodkar
 Don't know why Conductor Uncle killed me

 Just last year when i was learning to write Hindi in first class
 madars de par teacher ne kaha ki madars de par apni mummy ko letters likho
 i wrote my heart's talk in broken Hindi
 aaj main apni maa ke bare main boluungaa, maa tum kitna kaam karti ho, jab tumhaara kaam khatm ho jaataa he to tum tution ke liye pareshaan ho jaati ho, jab tum mujhe daantati ho to aisa lagata he ki mujhe pyaar kar rahi ho
 i was my mother's dear meri shaitaniyon par jhooth mooth ke gussa hoti thi, lekin main jaanata tha ki wo meri phikr karti hai
 i loved to be devilish, but i also loved reading
 class main first aane ke liye main khub padhai karata tha
 a few days ago my mother came to school and was feeling proud hearing my praise from the teachers
 meri mummy ro rahi hai
 i would have wiped their tears with my hands
 unhen chup karwaata, lekin main aisa nahin kar paa rahaa
 What was my fault, conductor uncle
 mujhe kyon maar diya aapane?sab kehete the pradhyumna to apni boli se hi dil jeet letaa he
 My mother used to tell my father that the whole Mohalla praised our son
 ab meraa puraa mohalla meri totali aawaaj ke liye taras rahaa he
 My mother has been crying ever since i left
 main jaanata hum ki unhen meri yaad aa rahi he
 i am also remembering them
 maa kahati thi ki main ghar kii raunak hum
 My laugh used to spread happiness in the house
 jabase main gaya hum, mere ghar kii sari khushiyaan chali gayi hai
 i know that my mother is longing to hear my voice
 meri maa mujhe dhudh rahi hai
 She is looking at my toys, admiring my books and sometimes takes my bed from her chest
 wo meri har cheez main mujhe talash rahi hai
 i was a piece of his liver, which was taken away from him by conductor uncle
 mere mummy-papa ne mujhe apni haisiyat se badhkar achche skool main bheja tha
 Thinking that Ryan's school will secure his son's future
 main skool jate hue kabhi nahin royaa

 kabhi kabhi to mujhe skool se ghar aane kaa man hi nahin karata tha, lekin ab main waapas apane ghar janaa chahta hum
 i want to hug my mother
 apni bahan ke saath khelnaa chahta hum, lekin mujhe pataa he ki ab main kabhi apane ghar nahin ja sakuunga
 Mother i will never be able to return now, but i know you will never forget me
 mujhe ye bhi pataa he ki tum mere liye papa ke saath milakar nyaay kii ladaai ladogi taaki kisi or maa ko tumhaari tarah apane bachche ke gam main aansu naa bahaanaa pade
 The parents said that their mother said that my child went out laughing that day
 iske baad skool se phone aayaa ki bathroom main gir gaya he or fortins aa jaao, ham bachche ko lekar ja rahe hai
 At the same time, Pradyuman's father told that Pradyuman was very jolly and very emotional
 usne apni maa kii tarif karte hue ek letters likhaa tha or cartoon jaisaa bhi banaaya tha
 At the same time, mother says that Pradyumna was very simple
 bahut maasoom sa tha
 Used to win everyone's heart
 hamaare mohalle ke sab log sirf uske bolne ke peeche pagal the
 He used to talk so much with everyone as Uncle, Aunty

 My upbringing was so good

 Was very intelligent

 dilli main ladakiyon ke khilaaf yon aparaadh (sexual woilence) kaa jo aankada saamne aayaa he vah behad daraavna he
 The big thing is that married women have not been included in it and according to the data, every third girl in the capital Delhi is victim of some kind of sexual violence
 kuch log aankadon kii hi bhashaa samajhate hai or ab aankadon se bhi saaf ho gaya he ki dilli mahilaon ke liye surakshit nahin he
 a recent report by Delhi's international non-governmental organization The Population Council has revealed shocking statistics of sexual violence against teenagers, ie girls between 10 and 14 years old
 shahari garib yani slam ilaakon main kiye gaye is survey ke mutabik dilli main 32 fisadi ladakiyon ne pichley ek saal main yon hinsa kii kisi naa kisi ghatana ko mahasoos kiya he
 Sharmistha Basu, researcher of the Population Council, says that we mainly chose the economically and socially backward area, because here on one side there is sexual violence and on the other side, the victim is not able to complain out loud
 sharmishtha ne kaha, hamane dekha he ki kai maamalon main ladkiyaan apane pear group yani doston se bhi ye baaten nahin baant paati, jabaki wo sabase najdiki hote hai
 Then leave the matter of going to the family and the police
 vaise maamla sirf ladakiyon tak hi simit ho aisa nahin he
 12 percent of the boys are also in this list with embarrassing figures
 zyaadaatar maamalon main ye yon hinsa kishor ladakon se unki umr se bade ladakon ne kii he
 Wherever we talk of Delhi being dangerous only for girls and statistics are showing that even boys here are not safe
 ab ye or baat he ki in maamalon kii sachai mata-pita ko nahin pataa hoti or naa hi police main report hoti hai
 Till date Sharmishtha asked whether girls older than 12 percent of boys who have accepted sexual violence have been involved in it
 is par sharmishtha kaa kahana tha ki is bare main spasht sawaal nahin puche gaye, lekin zyaadaatar maamalon main unase badi umr ke ladke hi isamen shaamil the
 However, this research report is not complete at the moment and different areas in Delhi will be part of it
 maujuuda research kaa ek mahatvapurn aankada ye bhi he ki bacchon ke saath yon hinsa ke in maamalon main se zyaadaatar ke bare main mata-pita ko bhi jaankaree nahin hoti, kyonki ek to mata-pita bacchon ke vishwaasapaatr nahin ban pate or doosraa ise wo tabu yani naa bataane vaali baat samajhakar chupa lete hai
 Obviously, the responsibility of protecting children from sexual violence cannot be left to the law, but the parents also have to be constantly in touch with the children and become trustworthy

 khadse ne kaha ki 'bhale hi maine apane khilaaf aaropon ke chalate istipha de diya he, yadi maine apana munh kholaa to puraa desh hill jayega
 Targeting Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, Khadse said that the BJP is leading the saffron alliance in the state due to the steps he has taken to break ties with the Shiv Sena before the last assembly elections
 unhone kaha, 'yadi vidhansabha chunaav se pehle bijepi or shivasena kaa gathbandhan nahin tutaa hota to maharashtra main shivasena kaa mukhyamantri hota

 Star: 2 Director: Vishal Pandyakalakar: Surveen Chawla, Jai Bhanushali and Sushant Singh Often some films are made clear before they are made
 usee tarah kii film het story-2 bhi he
 The aim is to serve adult spices to adult audiences, and to keep the story on the line of vengeance for a girl
 bilkul usee tarah jaise het story kii pawali dam ne kiya tha
 Just do not think about this fund
 pehle premi ke saath sex seen or phir jab badla lene kii baari aati he to apane jism kaa istemaal
 Hate Story-2 is a similar story
 hindi cinema ke edlt certificate milane vaali aakhri seemaa tak jane vaale bold seen hai
 Another film for such cinema enthusiasts
 kahani main kitna damek ladki sonika (surveen) akshay (jai) naam ke ladke se ji-jaan se pyaar karti he
 But a Dabangg (sushant Singh) is crazy about his love
 bas, isi deewangi main vah sonika ke premi kaa katl kar kar detaa he or phir yah majaboor ladki hatyaron se badla lene kii thaan leti he
 The period of sex and bold scenes in the film also runs fiercely
 lekin kahani puri tarah se lachar najar aati he
 The dialogue of the film also does not make an impact and at times seems like a joke
 aise main ek acha topic puri lay hi kho baithta he
 Star Appealfilm's lead starcasts Jai Bhanushali and Surveen Chawla are both making their big screen entries on television
 jai bhanushaali ke liye film main kuch nahin he
 Surveen is everything in the film
 haalanki unhone apana best dene kii koshish kii he, phir vah chaahe acting kaa maamla ho yaa boldnes kaa
 They still have a lot of work to do in terms of expressions
 jisamen pichley part kii pawali dam ko maharath hasil thi
 Sushant Singh looks good
 kamai kii batbharat main edlt filmon kaa bada bazaar rahaa he or het story ko bhi acha rispons mila tha
 In recent times, Ragini MMS-2 was also liked
 yani aisa audiyans taiyaar ho gaya he jo is tarah kii bold filmon ko pasand karata he
 Anyway, there is a lot of hype about the film
 film kaa gaanaa aaj phir tum pe pyaar aayaa he or pink lips pehle hi surkhiyon main rahe hai
 The film is low budget and Surveen has a good fan following and many fans of Hate Story series

 Before the Lok Sabha elections, the RJD chiefs were desperate to increase their base
 yah argedy ke sheersh netaaon kii baithak thi
 Discussion was going on on the election strategy when the issue of alliance between two Rajya Sabha mps Ram Kripal Yadav and Premchand Gupta started to be debated
 premchand gupta chaahate the ki lalu yadav is baar ram vilaas paswan kii lok janashakti party (algepi) ke saath nirarthak gathjod se chhutkaaraa paa len
 But Ram Kripal said that if the LJP gains even one percent of the vote, then this alliance should be maintained
 lalu prasad yadav ko bhi yah baat janch gai kyonki ve aam chunaav se pehle apane janaadhar ko badhaane ke liye betaab hai
 In 2009, Lalu, who was then the railway minister in UPA-1, tied up with the LJP chief at the expense of the Congress and paid a heavy price
 is baar unhone tay kar liya he ki ve jamini hakeekat ke aadhaar par hi siton kaa bantwaaraa karenge, na ki puraani dharanaon ke aadhaar par
 a week later, Lalu told a close aide of Paswan, 'tell your leader not to garland prospective candidates while visiting
 matadaata bhramit hota he
 'lalu is trying hard to get an alliance with the Congress before the elections
 argedy ke ek saansad ne kaha, 'lalu november, 2012 se kam-se-kam teen baar rahul gandhi se mil chuke hai
 'the Congress fought the 2009 Lok Sabha elections alone while both Lalu and Paswan were ministers in UPA-1 and were giving the Congress only three seats in the 40 Lok Sabha seats of Bihar
 congress akele ladi or 10
 Gained 26 percent of the vote
 is vajah se argedy-algepi gathbandhan ko kai siton par munh kii khaani padi
 Due to the split of anti-nda votes, Lalu's Jheli got only 4 seats while in 2004 it had 24 mps (22 in Bihar and 2 in Jharkhand)
 algepi ko ek bhi seat nahin mili
 On the other hand, the NDA got 32 seats and the Congress two
 argedy pramukh ab loksabhaa chunaav se saal bhar pehle hi apni galtiyaan sudhaarney main lag gaye hai
 The rising crowds in public meetings have encouraged him, but he is well aware that he has to work very hard
 2010 ke vidhansabha chunaav main argedy kaa safaya hone ke baad se bihar main chaar up-chunaav ho chuke hai
 The ruling coalition won all four seats, but RJD or Lalu-backed candidates increased their votes on all seats
 lalu ke liye acchhee khabar yah he ki 14 pratishat se zyada aabaadi vaali yadav jati par ab bhi unki pakad bani hui he
 However, there are reasons for concern for him as well
 jediu ke netritv vaale endie or unki party ke bich voton kii sankhya kaa antar bhi bad gaya he
 Lalu's vote base has weakened further in the nexus between Nitish Kumar's Janadhar-based EBC (extremely backward castes), Mahadalit, forward castes and Pasmanda Muslims
 nitish apane gathbandhan kii ore se badi sankhya main yadav or muslim ummidavaaron ko tikat dekar lalu ke janaadhar main send lagane main safal rahe hai
 Today the JDU has a greater number of Yadav and Muslim mlas than the RJD
 2009 ke aam chunaav or 2010 ke bihar vidhansabha chunaave ke nateezon se teen baaten saaf hai: lalu kaa aparaajey samajhe jane vaala muslim-yadav (maai) janaadhar dharashayi ho chukaa he
 Nitish enjoys considerable support from the backward castes and Mahadalits
 agadi jatiyon kaa ek varg or kuch jagahon par musalmaan congress ke samarthak ho gaye hai
 The problem for Lalu is that despite the anti-incumbency sentiments against Nitish, the social equations in Bihar politics have not changed
 bihar ke rajnatik paridrishy par gaharaai se najar daalane par pataa chalata he ki log lalu kii jansabhaon main isliye nahin jutane lage hai ki unki lokapriyata bad gai he
 They are gathering because people are angry with many policies of Nitish government
 lekin kya yah naaraazgi lalu ke liye voton main tabdeel hogi, yah bada sawaal he
 In April last year, when Sonia Gandhi arrived at her daughter's wedding reception at Lalu's Tughlaq Marg residence in New Delhi, Lalu laughed and told her that her daughter was also joining the Congress family
 unka ishaara tha ki unki beti kii shaadi haryana yuva congress ke adhyaksh chiranjeev raav se ho rahi he jo haryana ke mantri ajay singh yadav ke bete hai
 Sonia smiled at this and said that Congress also likes Lalu
 ab loksabhaa chunaav se saal bhar pehle lalu ko puri ummid he ki sonia apni kahi hui baat ko hakeekat main tabdeel karengi
 Nepal Nation Bank on Thursday banned the use of new 500 and 2000 rupee notes of India

 ullekhneey he ki bharat sarkaar ne 8 november conotbandiki ghoshnaa karte hue 1000 or 500 ke puraane noton kii jagah 2000 va 500 rupee kaa nayaa note chalaane kii ghoshnaa kii or nae note bharat main chalan main bhi he

 According to the party's national president Sharad Yadav, there is not much money in the state disaster relief fund, while the scope of the damage is quite large
 sharad yadav ne enditivi se kaha, 'ye chitthee likhakar krishi mantri sirf zimmedaari taalane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 The central government is doing nothing except giving speeches
 ' At the same time, Congress President Sonia Gandhi, who came out to face the problems of the farmers, assured her that she will continue to fight for the rights of the farmers during the meeting with the affected farmers in Neemuch region of Madhya Pradesh on Thursday
 sonia ne muaavje ke liye upi ke siem akhilesh ko ek chitthee bhi likhi he
 While during his visit to Mumbai, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has expressed concern over the reports of farmers committing suicide from different parts of the country and appealed to banks to help them

 hairaani kii baat rahi ki aditya thakare kii jagah apratyaashit rup se party ke varisht netaa ekanath scindia ko shivasena ne apana netaa chunaa
 Earlier, there were speculations that Aditya Thackeray would be elected as the leader of the legislative party in the meeting
 yahi nahin jaankaree ke mutabik baithak main yuva sena pramukh aditya thakare ne khud ekanath scindia ke naam kaa prastaav rakhaa tha
 Eknath Shinde, who was elected MLA for the fourth consecutive time, let me tell you that Kinnath Shinde was a cabinet minister in the Fadnavis government of Maharashtra
 ekanath thane ke kopri-panchapakhaadi nirvachan kshetra se ek baar phir vidhayak chune gaye hai
 Let me tell you that before this Eknath Shinde was elected MLA from the same assembly constituency on three consecutive elections in 2004, 2009 and 2014 on Shiv Sena ticket
 vidhayak chune jane se pehle ekanath scindia thane mahanagar palika main do kaarykaal tak nagar sevak bhi rah chuke hai
 Eknath was once an auto rickshaw driver Eknath was born on 9 February 1964 in Maharashtra
 ekanath scindia maharashtra ke satara jile main pahari jawali taluka se aate hai
 After coming to Thane city, he studied till 11th standard from Mangala High School and Junior College, Thane
 iske baad aajeevika chalaane ke liye vah auto rickshaw chalaane lage
 Eknath is a resident of Wagle Estate area of thane
 thane main bolti he scindia kii totimumbai se sate thane jile main scindia kii tuuti bolti he
 Shinde's influence in the district is such that whether a Lok Sabha election or a body election is always his candidate wins the election
 ekanath ke bete shrikant scindia bhi shivasena ke hi tikat par kalyaan seat se saansadchunakar loksabhaa pahunche hai
 Shinde's political journey has been 2004: Elected to Maharashtra Legislative Assembly 2009: Elected to Maharashtra Legislative Assembly 2014: Elected to Maharashtra Legislative Assembly October 2014-december 2014: Leader of Opposition in Maharashtra Legislative Assembly 2014: As Cabinet Minister of PWD in Maharashtra State Government Appointed in 2018: Appointed as Shiv Sena leader 2019: Cabinet Minister Public Health and Family Welfare Minister (maharashtra Too government) October 31, 2019 was elected party leader in day assembly Thursday assam kaa neshnal register of citigens (NRC) kaaphi charchaa main he
 There is a lot of politics and debate on this
 aisa kaha ja rahaa he ki assam enarasi ke maamle main pahal karne vaala pehla rajya he or ab baaki rajyon main bhi enarasi laane kii maang kii ja rahi he
 But you will be surprised to know that NRC has already been prepared in all the states of the country
 aaie jaanate hai kya he sachai
 
 
 In fact, after the partition of the country, it was necessary to know how many people have been in the country legitimately or illegally
 isliye aazaadee ke baad saal 1951 main hi desh bhar main ek neshnal register of citigens taiyaar kiya gaya tha
 It was formulated in all states
 is tarah abhi assam main jo enarasi taiyaar kiya ja rahaa he vah nayaa nahin he, balki 1951 ke enarasi ko hi apadet kiya ja rahaa he
 In the year 1951, a nationwide census was conducted, in which information was obtained according to the order of all the houses in each village and how many people live in it
 iske baad is janaganana kii sahaayta se hi neshnal register of citigens taiyaar kiya gaya
 After preparing this register, it was placed in the offices of deputy commissioner and SDM of all areas on the instructions of the central government
 baad main 1960 ke dashak main ye register police vibhaag ko saunp die gaye
 What is the NRC of Assam: The NRC of Assam is actually an exercise to update the NRC formed in the year 1951
 isamen un sabhi logon ko shaamil kiya ja rahaa he jinka naam 1971 se pehle kii matadaata suchi yaa 1951 ke enarasi main shaamil he
 How NRC was updated in Assam The fact that the NRC was prepared in 1951 in all the states was based on the census, in which proper verification of people was not done
 is tarah assam main enarasi kaa apadation, vah bhi citigenship ke veriphication ke saath karne kii itani badi kavayad kisi rajya main pehali baar hui he
 In the 1980s, there was a major movement to eject illegal people in Assam
 ol assam students unionne pradhanmantri ko gyaapan dekar 1951 ke enarasi ko apadet karne kii maang kii
 But after this, the Assam Accord signed in 1985 did not include the update of NRC
 1990 main aasu ne maang kii ki assam samjhaute ko lagu kiya jaae
 It was then decided to update the NRC in the tripartite agreement on 17 November 1999
 manmohan singh ke daur main mili manzooritatkaleen sarkaar ne shuruaati kaam ke liye 20 karod rupee kii raashi manjuur kii
 But for many reasons this work could not be started
 iske baad phir manmohan singh ke kaarykaal main 5 may, 2005 main hue tripaksheeya samjhaute main enarasi ko apadet karne karne ko manjuuri mili
 But the work did not progress much further
 phir 22 april, 2010 ko hui ek tripaksheeya baithak ke baad rajya ke chigaanv or barpeta cirkil main payalat project shuru hua
 The UPA government gave the responsibility to Prateik Hajela The current process started with the UPA government itself in 2013, when Prateek Hajela was upgraded to NRC and made the State Coordinator
 lekin vaastavik kaary ne teji pakadi farvari 2015 main jab enarasi seva kendron ko sthapit karne kii prakriya shuru hui or 6
 3 to put names in NRC with 6 crore documents
 29 karod logon ne applai kiya
 Supreme Court directive In August 2014, the Supreme Court ordered the Assam government to complete the entire NRC updation process within three years
 centre sarkaar ne is register ko apadet karne ke liye 288 karod rupee manjuur kiye

 The hung mandate in Haryana may be double that of the Congress
 Legislative Assembly: Haryana Assembly election results have come
 nateezon main kisi bhi raajnneetik dal ko spasht bahumat nahin mila he
 However, BJP has emerged as the single largest party with 40 seats
 vahiin congress 31 siton ke saath duusare sthaan par he jabaki jejepi ko 10 seat par jeet mili he
 Let us know that for the Congress disappointed in the defeat of Lok Sabha elections, Bhupendra Singh Hooda is once again seen to be Sanjeevani in Haryana
 congress alaakaman ne bhupendra singh hooda ko haryana main cheharaa banane or kumari shailaja ko pradesh adhyaksh banane kaa faisla vidhansabha chunaav elaan se mahaj 15 din pehle liya he
 In such a situation, the question arises that Sonia Gandhi was stuck in the fascination of the party and son Rahul Gandhi, due to which Bhupendra Singh took a long time to express confidence in Hooda
 bataa den ki 2014 ke vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi ko 47, congress 15, inelo ko 19 or anya ko 9 siten mili thim
 Interestingly, after the 2014 assembly elections, Bhupendra Singh Hooda had been demanding the removal of Haryana's then state president Ashok Tanwar, but being close to Rahul Gandhi, the Congress top leadership ignored it
 ye hai haryana ke chunavi nattejeyhalat ye ho gai ki hooda ne rohtak main raily karke tanvar ko hataane ke liye congress aalaakaman ko ultimatum tak de diya
 After this, Ashok Tanwar was removed from the post of state president and handed over the command of Kumari Seljako Party and Bhupendra Singh Hooda was made CLP leader and the face of Congress in Haryana
 congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ne haryana main bhupendra hooda ke chehre ke sahare chunavi maidan main utarane kaa faisla 4 sintabar ko liya
 In Haryana, Hooda was given complete leeway for every decision in the election, from the selection of Congress candidates
 hooda ne ran main utarkar puraa chunaav sthaneey muddon par ladaa or khud ko khatter ke vikalp ke taur par khadaa kiya
 Due to this, a large section of the Jat community appeared to be united with the Congress in the name of Hooda
 aise main sawaal uthta he ki agar congress alaakaman ne bhupendra singh hooda ko kaman or pehle saunpi hoti to haryana ke nattejey kuch or hi hote? The Congress, the oldest political party in the country, had been hoping that for the last 40 days, that hope was broken
 rahul gandhi nahin maane or aakhirkaar buudhvaar ko unhone party ke adhyaksh pad se istipha de hi diya
 At the same time, he also said that the party should choose its new president as soon as possible
 jis tarah se chaar panne kii chitthee likhakar unhone isaki ghoshnaa kii he usase congress ke saamne sankat khadaa ho gaya he or log kah rahe hai ‘ek thi congress’
 On 23 May 2019, when pictures of the celebrations were coming from the BJP headquarters in Delhi, the biggest leader of the Indian National Congress (INC) was writing the role of his backstage at 12 Tughlaq Lane, just one and a half kilometers from there
 23 may ko nattejey ke din rahul gandhi niraash the, itnaa niraash ki nateezon ke saamne aane se pehle hi unhone amethi main haar maan lee thi
 That too when Amethi had three lakh votes left
 lekin aisa lag rahaa tha jaise nattejey main unki dilchaspee hi khatm ho gai ho
 Because Amethi was not just a seat, it was also a fight for Rahul Gandhi's honor
 unki maa sonia or pita rajeev donon ne is seat kaa pratinidhitiv kiya tha, wo khud pandrah saalon se yahaan ke saansad the
 Amethi's humiliating defeat also defeated the desire for leadership within Rahul Gandhi
 bahari aalochanaon, fasebuk-twitor or duusare madhyamon par ude majaak or party kii andruni uthaa patake ne rahul gandhi ko us mode par pahunchaa diya tha jahaan wo apane aap ko naakaam maan chuke the
 The letter he has written forty days after the results is a confession of this fact
 is chitthee se congress ke netaaon ko jhatka laga hi, usase zyada virdohi dalon ke netaaon, twitor trobers or fasebuk ke swayambhu raajnneetik vishleshkon ko laga jo unke istife ko beete 40 din se naatak bataa rahe the
 On his decision, Adigal Rahul snatched the role of the next joke from him
 rajasthan ke mukhyamantri ashok gahalot manaane pahunche the
 The Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh came to celebrate Kamal Nath
 mallikarjun khadge bhi manaane pahunche the
 Mother herself went to Sonia Gandhi and sister Priyanka Gandhi
 lekin rahul tus se mas nahin hue
 Thousands of activists also tried to persuade
 netaa dharne par baith gaye the, jaan dene ke abhinay se lekar istifon kii qatari tak
 Surely these voices reached Rahul, but could not shake him
 kya rahul gandhi kaa istipha ek swaabhaavik faisla he? kya rahul gandhi kii pakad sanghathan par kamjor ho gai thi? rahul ne bahut beman se ye baat kahi thi
 Neither Rahul himself, not the Congress nor the country hoped that the Congress would defeat Modi in the Lok Sabha elections
 lekin ye sabko lag rahaa tha ki wo pehle se behatar karegi
 But when Rahul lost to Amethi at the hands of Smriti Irani, both his credibility and courage responded
 to aap kah sakate hai ki congress main gaiyr gandhi yug kaa pehla adhyay likhaa ja chukaa he lekin isaki naubat ai kaise
 Whether or not Rahul Gandhi has been defeated by circumstances or lack of experience, this question is being raised again and again
 ek saal saat maheene or 17 din, bas itani hi rahi rahul gandhi kii adhyakshata kii umr
 He has written that many times party leaders leave him alone
 ab congress party ke saamne ek baar chunauti he khud ko khadaa karne kii, ek nayaa adhyaksh chunane kii
 But the biggest challenge in this challenge is that they have to do this work without Gandhi family
 kyonki pad chhodte vakt rahul gandhi kah chuke hai ki naa to wo adhyaksh chunenge or naa hi is prakriya main shaamil honge
 Pakistan will be handed over the DNA and finger prints of terrorist Kasab in connection with the terrorist attacks
 bharat ne ravivaar ko kaha ki padosi desh pakistan ko sabooton kii fehrist main mumbai main hue hamale ke dauraan pakade gaye aatanki ajmal kasaab ke diene or finger print ko saunpa jayega
 Kasab has criminal cases in Pakistan, which would facilitate the matching of this evidence

 bihar ke shiksha mantri pi ke shahi ne bihar main gunvatttapurna shiksha kii aavashyaktaa jataate hue kaha ki agar bacchon ko gunvatttapurna shiksha pradaan nahin kiya gaya to maan liya jaye ki humlog jwalamukhi ke muhane par baithe hai
 Addressing a convocation ceremony of the British Council of India, Shahi while expressing the need for quality education in Bihar said that for the better future of two crore children studying in class one to ten in the state schools, along with quality education, They will also have to provide better knowledge of the language

 Shahi has said that an agreement has been made with the UK Department for International Development to train teachers to help children learn better English language and Bihar Language Initiative in Secondary Schools (blys), launched in January last year ) 120 select teachers have been trained under the program

 Addressing the function, the British Council of India Rob Lyons called for the need to teach English and English to children and teachers in Bihar and said that a person with better knowledge of English language has a 34 percent chance of getting employment

 Team India captain Cool MS Dhoni is facing a lot of criticism for his Test captaincy
 is bich purv captain saurav ganguli kaa maananaa he ki dhoni lagbhag 60 maichon main team kii kaman sanbhaalane ke baavjood pichley kuch samay se test str par team se sarvshereshth pradarshan karaane main safal nahin ho paa rahe hai
 Ganguly, who played the role of expert commentator during the current Test series between India and Australia, called Dhoni's record as an ODI captain an excellent one but said that this experienced wicketkeeper batsman has been battling for some time in the Test format
 ganguli ne kaha, ‘yah sirf in do maichon kii baat nahin he, pichley kuch samay se aisa (dhoni jujh rahaa he) ho rahaa he
 He is not able to bring the team to the level of Test match
 yah chayankartaaon par nirbhar he lekin test captain ke rup main use kaaphi samay mil gaya he, lagbhag 60 test match
 i think he's got a lot of time
 ’ganguli ne is dauraan up captain viraat kohli kii jamkar tarif kii or unhen bhartiya cricket kaa bhavishya qaraar diya
 He said, 'I think he (kohli) is the future

 ’input bhashaa se The knock in Priyanka Gandhi's active politics before Lok Sabha Election 2019 has once again entangled the political equation of UP
 upi main ab tak bhaajapa or sapa-basapa gathbandhan ke bich sidhi takkar ko priyanka gandhi kii entry ne ab muqabla trikoniya bana diya he
 Ever since Priyanka Gandhi's political entry, now everyone is asking the same question: Will the Congress benefit from the Congress claiming a strong claim? Will this step of Congress harm Mayawati? If some political equations are looked at, such situations are seen that the BJP may benefit directly from the coming of the Congress
 darasal, uttar pradesh main mayawati or akhilesh yadav dwaara sapa-basapa gathbandhan se congress ko alag rakhane ke baad party adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne elaan kiya tha ki congress party rajya kii sabhi 80 siton par chunaav ladegi
 a few days later, he brought a new twist in the politics of UP by making his sister Priyanka Gandhi the Congress general secretary and in-charge of eastern UP
 vahiin congress ne jyotiraditya sindhiya ko pashchimi upi kii kaman dekar upi main yah sandesh de diya he ki congress abhi res se alag nahin hui he
 This is also because Rahul Gandhi has clearly stated that his party Congress will not play on the backfoot at any cost in the state
 haalanki, priyanka gandhi or jyotiraditya sindhiya ko kramash: purvi upi or pashchimi upi kaa prabhaar dene ke baad bhi rahul gandhi ne mayawati or akhilesh yadav ke prati sammaan vyakt kiya
 He made it clear that both those stalwarts are not his enemies and he is ready to cooperate in the SP-BSP alliance if possible
 yani rahul gandhi ne ab bhi upi main sapa-basapa gathbandhan main apane daravaaje khol rakhe hai
 But now questions are arising that will this step of Congress affect sp-bsp's vote bank? Will the Congress infiltrate the BSP-SP votebank, which will benefit the BJP
 agar aisa hota he ti 2014 main 71 seat jeetne vaali bhaajapa ek baar phir se apni majboot upasthiti darj karaane main kaamyaab rahegi
 Sources in the SP-BSP alliance insisted that the Congress would not be able to make a dent in Mayawati's vote bank
 vah mayawati ke votbank ko nahin tod paaegi, jisamen zyaadaatar dalit yaa phir anya pichhadaa varg shaamil hai
 At the same time, this alliance also has a combination of Muslim vote banks who support Akhilesh Yadav's Samajwadi Party
 samaajawaadee party kii juhi singh ne kaha ki aisa kar paanaa congress ke liye mushkil he
 a Congress leader said that it was more likely that the Congress party would make a dent in the bjp's upper caste (upper caste) vote bank, as this class first supported the Congress, which later shifted to the BJP
 sutron ne kaha ki party un mahatvapurn siton par majboot ummidavaar utaaregi jo brahman-thakur votaron vaale aadhaar par kabja karenge
 However, bjp's Siddharth Nath Singh rejected these possibilities
 unhone kaha ki 'mujhe andeh he ki congress ko brahmanon ke vot milenge
 Actually, the upper castes are intellectuals and have seen PM Modi take decisive decisions
 iske alaava, ucch jatiyon ko 10 pratishat kota mila he, jo ve chaahate the
 Explain that the new quota law which will give reservation in jobs and education to the economically weaker sections in the general category
 vahiin, samaajawaadee party kii pravaktaa juhi singh ne spasht kiya ki mahagathbandhan ke bheetar kisi bhi nakaaratmak parinaam ke liye congress ko jimmedaar mana jayega
 He said, "it is an internal matter of the Congress how she wants to contest the elections, but her advice to us is that if you take responsibility, then you also have to be accountable
" "saal 2009 main congress ne 21 siten jeetin thim
 But in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, this figure reached two and the Congress party could save only Sonia Gandhi's Rae Bareli and Rahul Gandhi's Amethi seat
 itnaa hi nahin, congress kaa vot share bhi ab tak ke sabase nichle str 7
 Came down to 5 percent
 vahiin, 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav main akhilesh yadav kii samaajawaadee party ke saath gathbandhan main ladane vaali congress ne amethi or raibareli loksabhaa kshetron main se 10 vidhansabha siton main se mahaj chaar par jeet hasil kii thi
 At that time also Akhilesh Yadav had indicated that his alliance was shattered by the alliance with the Congress
 magar is baar, akhilesh yadav ke saath gathjod kii ghoshnaa karne vaali mayawati ne congress ko alag rakhane kaa kaaran yah bataaya ki congress party ke paas vot transfar karne kii kshamta nahin he
 At the same time, Rahul Gandhi said that the Congress has a lot to offer to the people of Uttar Pradesh

 Master blaster Sachin Tendulkar (sachin Tendulkar) may not be seen playing on the field anymore, but still his fans still miss him a lot
 gali main cricket khilne se lekar vishwa cap tak sachin tendulkar hameshaa apane sangharsh ke dinon ke bare main baat karte aae hai
 Recently, in a tweet on his Twitter handle, he asked his fans about an employee of the Taj Coromandel Hotel in Chennai, after which he has now asked to meet the master blaster himself
 chennai ke hotel main kaam karne vaale karmchaaree ne eenai se baat karte hue kaha, ''sachin ke phans unase milanaa chaahate hai or vah mujhase milanaa chaahate hai
 So i am very excited
 jahaan main rahata hum vahaan ke log or mere dost sachin tendulkar se milane ke liye mujhase zyada utsahit hai
 So i request Sachin Tendulkar to meet me and my family and spend some time with us ''
 guruprasad ne sachin tendulkar se judi ghatana kaa zikr karte hue kaha, "us vakt main taj hotel main security guard kaa kaam karata tha
 Then i met him and i suggested to him that he gets out in the match because of his elbow guard
 "guruprasad ne aage kaha, ''jab aap sachin ko khelte hue kareeb se dekhte hai, to aapako pataa chalegaa ki valpani kalai kaa istemaal is tarah se karte hai, jo unke liye bahut mahatvapurn he
 When he faces the fast bowlers, they attack at a particular point and if the elbow guard is not engaged properly, the time and all goes wrong
 unhone mujhase poocha ki aap is baat ko kaise jaanate hai to maine kaha ki main sirf aapako televijan par dekh rahaa tha or mujhe laga ki albo guard aapke haath ke movement ko prabhavit kar rahaa he''
 Before that, Sachin Tendulkar shared a video on his Twitter and asked people to find this person from Chennai
 apane twit main sachin ne likhaa tha, ''main ek test series ke dauraan chennai ke taj coromandal main rukaa tha
 Then there was a staff member with whom i had a discussion about the Elbow Guard, after which i redesigned it
 main jaananaa chahta hum ki vah ab kahaan he or usase milanaa chahta hum''
 After this, he asked his fans on Twitter, "can you help me find this"? a chance encounter can be memorable! i had met a staffer at Taj Coromandel, Chennai during a Test series with whom i had a discussion about my elbow guard, after which i redesigned it
 i wonder where he is now & wish to catch up with him
 Hey netizens, can you help me find him? pic

 *** The battle for the 16th Lok Sabha has begun
 har dal ko pataa he ki satta ko saadhane ke liye 272 kaa jaadui aankada choona hoga or us aankade tak pahunchane main uttar pradesh kii sabase ahm bhoomika hogi
 In order to achieve this target, Narendra Modi, Rahul Gandhi and Arvind Kejriwal have jumped on the promise of their promises in the land of UP
 raajnneeti ke vyakaran main yah puraani kahawat kaaphi mashhoor he ki dilli ke liye satta kaa rasta lakhanu se hokar gujarata he
 Lucknow means the city of the old Nawabs and the capital of Uttar Pradesh in the new era
 vahi uttar pradesh, jahaan se loksabhaa ke liye 80 sadsy aate hai
 This is the reason why bjp's PM candidate Narendra Modi, Congress's future Rahul Gandhi and aap's hopeful Arvind Kejriwal have turned all the way to UP
 jawaharlal nehru, bahadur shastri, indira gandhi, charan singh, rajeev gandhi, vishwanath pratap singh, chandrashekhar or atal bihari vaajapeyi- hindustan ke ab tak 8 pradhanmantri upi se hi nikalakar aae
 Even if PM is not made, then no one knows that the government is formed by the person who has the hand of UP
 pichhali baar congress ko 22 siten milin, to manmohan singh kii duusari pari aasaan ho gai
 That is why everyone has been involved in the 80th litmus test
 modi-kejariwal se rahul tak
 When the Lok Sabha battle broke out, Rahul set up a roadshow in Varanasi
 baba vishwanath kii nagari main rikhshaavaalon ke aansu ponchney nikal gaye
 Would have thought what to know, the corruption charges against the Manmohan government in these tears should be washed away
 kya pataa, choti-choti sabhaayen loksabhaa ke liye bada rasta khol den
 Somewhere Rahul does not turn over, so before coming to Lucknow, Narendra Modi shouted - 'rahul ten numbers
 
 
 '
 On March 1, Rahul Gandhi was in the city of Baba Vishwanath, then on Sunday, Narendra Modi is in Lucknow for the Vijay Shankhanad rally
 arvind kejariwal kanpur main raily kar rahe hai vahiin sapa mukhiya mulaayam singh yadav or upi ke siem akhilesha yadav kii elahabaad main chunavi raily ho rahi he
 Targeting Modi, Mulayam has said that Modi should not focus on the rally crowd, but focus on development
 dilli main bijepi ke satta rath ko bas chaar vidhayakon kii duuri par roak chuke kejariwal ab 84 kilometre kii duuri par khadey narendra modi ko lalakaarenge or modi lakhanu se dilli jeet lene kaa sapana bijepi ko dikhaaenge
 The battle for Parliament has now come on the road to the sixteenth Lok Sabha
 isliye satta ke udankhatole sadak par dol rahe hai
 Somewhere in the form of a rally, somewhere in the form of a road show, and sometimes as a street debate
 har cheharaa khud ko sabase khubasurat banane kii aakhri kavayad main juta he
 Arvind Kejriwal is enthusiastic about the victory in the Delhi Assembly so much that the AAP was so excited that Arvind Kejriwal started saying that he is directly against Narendra Modi
 ab ye muqabla do march ko upi main dikhegaa, jab kanpur se kejariwal apane daavon or vaadon kaa bahi-khaataa kholenge
 But before that, it also tried to touch 17 Lok Sabha seats through road shows
 gajiabad se kanpur kii 464 kilometre kii duuri tay karne main vaise to 6 ghante lagenge, lekin kejariwal ko yah duuri tay karne main tees ghante kaa samay lagegaa
 But in thirty hours Kejriwal wants to measure 17 Lok Sabha seats in Uttar Pradesh
 is naap ke liye unke paas paimaana he dilli main unki 49 dinon kii sarkaar kaa kaam-kaaj
 When Kejriwal was contesting the Assembly elections in Delhi, very few people knew that the AAP sweep would clean up the Congress's existence and the bjp's dream in one stroke
 tab kejariwal dilli kii galiyon se har muhalle tak apni dastak de rahe the
 Now Kejriwal is trying the same bet on the battle of 545 seats of Lok Sabha by moving from 70 assembly seats in Delhi
 gajiabad se kanpur kaa safar isaki shuruyaat he
 Once upon a time, western Uttar Pradesh used to follow at the behest of former Prime Minister Chaudhary Charan Singh
 viraasat unke bete ajit singh ko mili, lekin samay ke saath unka asar or aadhaar kamjor hota chalaa gaya
 Kejriwal is now eyeing Charan Singh's legacy
 kanpur main do march kii raily kejariwal kii takat kaa pehla litmus test he
 But before this rally, Kejriwal through his roadshow to leave impact on Ghaziabad, Meerut, Moradabad, Amroha, Rampur, Bareilly, Shahjahanpur, Hardoi, Unnao, Kanpur, Kanpur Dehat, Auraiya, Etawah, Firozabad, Agra, Mathura and Gautam Budh Nagar tried
 lekin virdohi kehete hai ki upi dilli nahin he
 Kejriwal has already announced that he is competing with Narendra Modi
 ab yah ittfa he yaa sochi-samajhi ranneeti ki jis kanpur se upi main modi ne apni chunavi sabhaaon kaa shriganesh kiya tha, vahiin se kejariwal bhi aagaaj kar rahe hai
 Modi will be in Kejriwal Kanpur to win UP, while Narendra Modi will be in Lucknow with his team
 bijepi ke liye lakhanu sirf isliye ahm nahin he ki wo upi kii rajdhani he, balki isliye bhi he ki yaheen se uske shikhar purush atal bihari vaajapeyi kai baar loksabhaa main pahunche
 Now Modi will formulate a strategy to win UP from here
 modi kaa mishan to 272 plus he
 That is why most eyes are focused on 80 seats of UP, also of Narendra Modi, BJP and also of the Sangh, because everyone knows that if UP wins, it will be very easy to win the country
 modi ne upi ke alag-alag hisson main raily kar lee
 From Kanpur to Varanasi and from Meerut to Gorakhpur, his Uddkhatola kept the hopes of lotus blooming
 kahin puraane raag gaae gaye, to kahin 56 inch ke seene par vikaas ke naare uchhaale gaye
 Now the question is how many seats in UP will be guaranteed by bjp's victory in 56-inch chest beats
 lekin chunaav tak ummid koun chhodega
 So now the target is directly on Lucknow, where Modi will rally on two fronts, directly in the heart of UP
 bijepi ke liye lakhanu kii ahmiyat is baat se bhi bad jaati he ki pradhanmantri rahete hue atal bihari vaajapeyi yaheen se chunaav ladate the
 The question also arises as to whether Modi's feet will fall in Vajpayee's shoes? In Uttar Pradesh, BJP got 10 seats last time, while Congress got 22 seats
 modi is baar siton ke aankade ko bilkul badal dena chaahate hai or rahul puraani haisiyat ko kaayam rakhana chaahate hai
 That is why they are doing road shows and no matter where Modi lives, he does not miss to target them
 upi main 80 siton kii agnipariksha he
 Putting the number four party at number one is a difficult lesson for Modi
 congress se ladaai to desh bhar main he, upi main to mulaayam or mayawati pehle se taal thokkar khadey hai
 How would Rahul want to stay behind? Kejriwal is doing a road show, Narendra Modi will rally, then Rahul Gandhi is doing a road-meeting
 varanasi main rahul gandhi ne stesan ke paas hi aam logon kii chaoupal laga di
 On the pretext of listening to their misery, they tried to make a fizz for the Congress during the election season
 har dil par ungali rakhane kii aisi koshish aksar chunaav ke mausam main hi dekhne ko milti he
 In search of a new India, Rahul Gandhi is understanding the pain of the poor after 67 years of independence
 narendra modi aasmaan main ud rahe hai
 If Kejriwal is running on the road, Rahul Gandhi is sitting among the people and searching for his heart
 sabaki nazren upi par hi hai
 Rahul was supposed to go to Mirzapur from Banaras, but the trip was canceled if the weather deteriorated
 phir to rahul baba vishwanath kii sharan main chale gaye
 Be it Rahul or Modi, both are eyeing Delhi's throne
 ab puja bhi ek jaisaa hua, to isamen achraj kya he
 The situation of Delhi MCD election results is clear
 bhartiya janata party ne prachand jeet hasil kar ek baar phir emsidi par apana kabja kar liya he
 So the Aam Aadmi Party has suffered a huge setback with the results
 bijepi kii is jeet ke liye pradesh adhyaksh manoj tiwari ko bada shrey diya ja rahaa he, to vahiin amit shah ne bhi unhen jeet kii badhai di
 The advantage of being a Purvanchali face, BJP got a lot in the elections and recorded a historic victory
 aapako bataa den ki dilli mempurvaanchali votercaphi sankhya main hai, dilli main lagbhag 35 fisadi matadaata purvanchal se hai
 This is the reason why they have a lot of influence in elections
 sankhya ke hisaab se dekhen to lagbhag 40 lakh voter purvaanchali hai
 This has been the reason that BJP too adopted many policies to practice them
 manoj tiwari ko adhyaksh bananabijepi ke liye turup kaa ikkaa sabit hua
 Manoj Tiwari is from the east and is a popular face which BJP has benefited from
 manoj ke alaava ravikishan ne bhi chunaavon main kaaphi prachaar kiya
 Purvanchali has been a supporter of the Congress
 Let us tell you that the former people living in Delhi have traditionally been considered supporters of the Congress, but in the last assembly elections, their vote bank has gone away from them and gone with the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)
 
 congress ek baar phir se inhen apane saath jodgaye kii koshish kii thi
 The Congress party has given ticket to 54 workers of Purvanchal in the corporation elections
 aap ne bhi daale the doregauratlab he ki vidhansabha chunaavon main aap kii aitihaasik jeet kaa kaaran purvaanchali hi rahe the, yahi kaaran tha ki nigam chunaavon main bhi aap ne 30 se adhik purvaanchali ummidavaaron ko tikat diya tha
 14 AAP mlas and 2 ministers are still associated with Purvanchal
 shiksha manushya ko aatmanirbhar or samaaj ke prati javabdeh banaata he
 But culture gives a person the power to think
 samskruti ke bagaiyr saamaajik sanrachana kii kalpana bhi nahin kii ja sakati
 Actually, there was a change in society over time
 aadhunik samaaj main bhale hi takneekee sanchaar haaavee he lekin samskruti kii jad abhi bhi majboot he
 Especially in the case of Indian culture, the society had to face disarray on many occasions
 lekin samskruti kii jad itani gahari ho chuki he samaaj main tamaam vibhinnataaon ke baavjood ekajutata kii door dhili nahin padati
 Every year a new change comes in the society and we accept it even if the criteria of acceptance are different
 samaaj or samskruti ke lihaaj se saal 2016 bhi yaadon kaa pitara he
 Many changes were seen in the society, which strengthened the strings of culture and served to increase human spirits
 bhartiya samaaj main mahilaon kii sthiti kisi chuphi nahin he
 For years, there have been talk of strict laws and social consciousness to stop the crimes happening to women
 lekin sthiti main wo badlaav nahin he jo saamaajik dhaancha ko majbootee de
 Despite all the hurdles and protests, the year 2016 was very special for the woman
 mahila shashaktikaran kii disha main jo kadam uthaae gaye uske behatar parinaam mili
 The strings of culture proved to be so strong that the court also mentioned society and culture in its judgment
 iskaa kai jeeta-jaagta udhaaharan he
 The effect of the changing society and strong culture of women in the Shanishinganapur temple was that the doors of the temple were opened to women
 kanoon ko bhi badalte samaaj kii maang ke aage jhukna padaa
 From politics to court, society and culture could not ignore in their decision
 mahilaon ne apni maang saaf kar diya ki bhartiya samskruti unhen mandir ke andar jane kii pabandi nahin lagaataa to phir unhen unka haq milanaa chahie
 The demand caught on and the government had to intervene
 adaalat ne bhi apane faisle main samaajik sanrachana kaa zikr karte hue mahilaon ke paksh main faisle die
 When the change of women reaches inside the Dargah, then every section of the society gets involved in it
 shanishinganapur mandir mahilaon ke khulte hi muslim mahilaon ne mumbai kii mashhoor haji ali dargah main jane kii thaanee or maang jo pakadaney lagi
 Despite the millions of protests, this society ignored the protest and gave a decision in honor of women
 kyonki hamaari samskruti ijaajat detii he ki mahilaon ko samaan haq he
 Then in the name of tradition, society cannot be captured by law
 yahi nahin, dargah main mahilaon kii entry se samaaj or samskruti kii pakad or majboot hui
 There was a long-standing legal battle in this case
 dargah prabandhan kaa kahana tha ki mahilaon ko bheetar aane kaahkanhin he
 The women entered the dargah for the first time after winning a legal battle
 khel kii duniya mahilaon kaa parachammandir-masjid main entry kii nahin, mahilaon nesaal 2016main khel ke sabase bade mahakumbh main apni takat dikhaa di
 In the Olympics, Sakshi Malik, PV Sandhu and Deepika Karmakar put on such performances that the chest of the country widened with pride
 purushon ke mukaable behatar pradarshan karte hue desh kaa maan badhaayaa, ye wo ladkiyaan thim jo ghar kii charadivari main bhi rahati huin bhartiya paramparaon kaa nirvaahan kiya
 But the learning and culture from this society made him so excited that the world kept on watching
 bihar main sharabbandi kaa faislasb jaanate hai ki sharaab se kisi kaa bhala nahin hota,or samaaj ke liye ye ek abhishaap he
 But the decision to ban it was also not common
 bihar jaise rajya main jahaan gaanv kii galiyon-galiyon main kachi sharaab taiyaar kii jaati thi
 In backward areas, especially tribal Bahul areas, alcohol was considered a part of the culture
 aise main is par puri tarah se pabandi lagaana aasaan nahin tha
 a large section was raising its voice against this
 lekin jab sarkaar ne is pabandi kaa faisla liya to saamne samaaj or samskruti ko bachaane kii baat ai
 To this day, people of those areas have forgotten the liquor, whose morning started with alcohol
 is faisle ke peeche badalte samaaj or samskruti kaa ahm yogadan he
 The case also reached the court, but the victory was won by the alcohol-free Indian culture
 filmon main bhartiya samskruti kii jhalkasaal 2016 kuch aisi filmein ain, jisamen bhartiya samaaj or samskruti kii jhalak bakhubi dekhne ko mili
 In the film Sultan, actress Anushka Sharma was seen betting with men in the arena
 lekin jab samaaj or samskruti kii baat ai to apane kokh main pal rahe maasoom ko janm dene ke liye khel ko alavida kehane kaa faisla le liya
 Even though it was a part of the film, but these forces come to us from society and culture
 ye film badalte samaaj ke liye ek aaina tha
 Decision on demonetisation was taken in the name of economic progress in the history of India
 is faisle se har tabaka prabhavit hua
 By the way, these steps were taken to curb black money and corruption
 sarkaar ke is faisle kaa raajnneetik str par bhale hi virodh hua
 But at the social level, there was support from day one
 kyonki bharat samaaj or samskruti aise logon ke hameshaa khilaaf rahaa jo kaledhan or bhrashtachar main lipt hai
 However, due to the disturbances in the system, people gradually started raising questions about the decision
 lekin unka dhairya ghanton bank ke baahar line main khadey hone ke baad bhi nahin tutaa
 The government also linked the decision to Indian culture so that it does not have adverse effects in society
 log lakh pareshaani ke baad bhi ye kehete dikhe ki kuch vakt kii baat he or phir halaat saamaanya ho jaaenge
 This strength can only be found from Indian society and culture because its roots are extremely strong

 You will have to wait a little longer to know the accounts of the most innocent Havan
 ji haa, maasoom bhi or haivaan bhi
 Innocent because in the eyes of law, he was left only 170 days short of being called big
 or haivaan isliye kyonki wo ab tak ke sabase vahashiana gangrape or katl ke maamle kaa mulgim he
 The Juvenile Justice Board was to pronounce its fate on Thursday, which would prove to be a maximum sentence of three years if convicted
 lekin ab 16 disambar ke pehle insaaf ke liye 25 july tak intjaar karnaa hoga
 The crime was for an hour
 darindagi bhi kuch der kii or havas shaayad pal bhar kii
 Then life also lost one
 to itnaa hangaamaa kyon? 16 disambar ke pehle insaaf ko lekar itnaa ho-hallaa kyon? is desh main 16 disambar se pehle yaa uske baad phir koi rape, gangrape yaa murder nahin hua kya?bilkul hua he or aaj bhi ho rahaa he
 But on the night of December 16, the hour-long oppression, the delay of a few hours and the lust of a moment made the pain of that 23-year-old girl the pain of the whole country for the first time
 wo 13 din tak har rose marati rahi or 13 din tak desh shok manaata rahaa
 And after 13 days when she really died, every house in India felt like it should be her own weeds
 or bas isiilie 16 disambar ke is pehle faisle par puure desh kii nazren gad gai thim
 Amazing, the biggest one of that dreadful night of December 16
 puure desh ko jhakzor dene vaale ganganrape kaa sabase bada shaitan wo
 The age of drinking alcohol
 chhedhkhani kii samaj use
 The lust of rape was there
 uski darindi kii kahani sunakar khud bachche raat ko darane lagen
 But he could not be given a full sentence of his imprisonment
 kyoki 16 disambar 2012 kii raat jab wo bas kii pichhali seat par ek ladki kii izzat ke saath-saath uski ruh tak ko noch rahaa tha tab wo 17 saal chah maheene or 11 din kaa baccha tha
 Yes, the whole country fought with pain, anger and tears after that accident
 gangrape ke darindon ko sakht se sakht sajaa dene kii maang karata rahaa
 Demands were also accepted
 jald faisle ke liye fast trek court banaaya gaya
 But see that the person who was accused of being the most bloodthirsty that night, got away with the least punishment
 kroonki us raat wo 17 saal chah maheene or 11 din kaa baccha tha
 Three years, yes! Fakat three years
 yahi adhiktam sajaa he hamaare desh main us naaballig ke liye jisane chaahe rape kiya ho yaa murder
 On Friday, the Juvenile Justice Board was to deliver its first ruling on 16 December
 pehla insaaf karnaa tha, magar ye tal gaya, 25 july tak ke liye
 Now on July 25, it will be decided what to do with that 17 year old six month and 11 day old child? How much punishment should he give? How to punish? But whatever punishment will be there will be within three years
 kyonki doshi tehraae jane ke baad bhi zyada se zyada use yahi sajaa mil sakati he
 That is, three years, not even in jail, anywhere else
 kahaan ye bhi abhi saaf nahin he
 Because this child has grown up after committing the crime, so cannot be kept with children
 sirf 170 din or uske gale se faansee kaa fanda hameshaa-hameshaa ke liye dur ho gaya
 If he had done the same disgusting crime 170 days later, he would have been given life imprisonment for the crime, but not done
 kyonki us raat wo 17 saal chah maheene or 11 din kaa baccha tha
 According to the school certificate, the age of this gang-rape accused was 17 years, six months and 11 days on December 16, ie
 skool certificate ke mutabik ye baccha 4 june 1995 ko paidaa hua tha
 The Juvenile Justice Board, considering this certificate as evidence, called it a child
 or iske saath hi ye tay ho gaya ki gangrape ke baaki paanch aropiyon ke saath ipisi kii dhaaraon ke tahat 17 saal chah maheene or 11 din ke is bachche par mukadmaa nahin chalegaa
 And thus the sixth accused of gang rape survived for only 170 days
 isi saal 4 june ko ye baccha 170 din puraa karne ke baad ab bada bhi ho gaya he or balig bhi
 But what to do, in the eyes of the law, still that child remained
 kyonki kanoon uski umr us din se naap rahi he jis din usne jurm kiya tha
 And that night of crime, on 16 December, he was a child of 17 years, six months and 11 days
 rahul gandhi ke congress kaa kaman sanbhale abhi ek hi haftaa hua he, lekin itane kam samay main bhi unki leadership ne party ko kam se kam 3 maukon par 'achche din' hi dikhaa diya
 On December 16, Rahul took charge of the Congress after 19 years of Sonia Gandhi
 sonia gandhi ke kaarykaal main desh kii sabase puraani party 10 saal satta main rahi, lekin pichley 3 saalon main party ke liye kuch bhi acha nahin ho rahaa tha or na sirf centre main uski sthiti behad kharaab hui balki ek-ek karke rajyon se uski satta jaati rahi
 Today the situation is that the Congress is in power in only 4 states
 rahul ne gujarat chunaav ke dauraan hi congress kii kaman sanbhali or aakraamak andaaj main prachaar karte hue khud ko ek shashakt netaa ke rup main pesh kiya
 Before the Gujarat elections, he was considered a novice in politics and the opposition used to make fun of him
 lekin ab vakt badal gaya he, wo congress ke adhyaksh ban chuke hai or party ko unase kaaphi ummiden hai
 Rahul's ascension to the post of president has looked very spectacular for the Congress so far
