 Everyone should wait for the decision of the Supreme Court
 isamen kisi ko kudana nahin chahie
 '' congress ke varisht netaa pi chidambaram ne kaha, 'har paanch saal main chunaav se pehle bhaajapa ram mandir ke mudde par dhruvakaran karne kii koshish karti he
 This issue is now before the court
 sabko ucchtam nyaayalay ke faisle kaa intjaar karnaa chahie
 Nobody should jump into it
 '' The process of drafting a consensus for the Lokpal Bill was virtually derailed on Wednesday
 sanyukt samiti kii baithak main sarkaar or gandhivadi anna hazaare paksh ke bich ekarey kaayam nahin ho saki
 It was decided in the meeting that now two versions of the draft will be sent to the cabinet instead of joint
 isse saaf ho gaya ki 30 june tak donon pakshon ke bich aapasi rajamandi vaala ek hi masauda taiyaar ho paane kii ab sambhaavna nahin he
 After a period of deep deadlock and bitter rhetoric, the government and the Hazare parties could not form a consensus in the joint draft committee meeting which lasted nearly three hours
 baithak ke baad samiti main centre ke pratinidhi ke taur par shaamil maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantri kapil sibbal ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha, prastaavit lokapal vidheyak ke ahm or buniyadi muddon par donon pakshon ke bich sahmati nahin ban paayi he
 We have decided that in the next meeting to be held on June 20 and 21, both sides will put their respective draft for discussion
 unhone kaha ki agar donon masaudon par aam sahmati nahin ban paayi to cabinet ke samaksh lokapal vidheyak masaude ke do alag-alag sanskaran bheje jaayenge
 One version will be of the government and the other will be of social workers
 aisa isaliye kiya jaayegaa taaki koi yah nahin kahe ki sarkaar hazaare paksh ke masaude ko nazarandaaj kar rahi he
 Sibal said, i want to make it clear that the draft will be ready by June 30
 aam sahmati nahin banane par uske do sanskaran cabinet ko bheje jaayenge
 On this, RTI activist Arvind Kejriwal, who was involved on the Hazare side in the committee, said, "there was no result from this meeting
" centre ke rukh se aisa lag rahaa he ki pichley dedh maheene se chal rahi kavayad sarkaar kaa mahaj ek dikhaava thi
 "despite the differences, we will not boycott the next meeting of the joint committee to be held on June 20 and 21," Kejriwal said
 sarkaar ko ham apana masauda denge taaki janata yah dekh sake ki koun-sa masauda uchit he
 
 
 It seems that the government wants to make Lokpal ineffective even before it comes into existence
 sibbal or hazaare paksh ne pushti kii ki aaj kii baithak main pradhanmantri, ucch nyaaypalika or sansad ke andar saansadon ke aacharan ko prastaavit lokapal kii jaanch ke daayre main laane ke mudde par koi baatcheet nahin hui
 Sibal said, these issues have not been negotiated
 unhone kaha, cabinet ke samaksh ek hi dastavej bheja jaayegaa, lekin usamen lokapal vidheyak masaude ke do sanskaran honge
 It will be clear in the document that on which issues there is agreement and disagreement between the two parties
 donon sanskaran saarvajanik kiye jaayenge
 We intend to involve political parties in this process as well
 kya donon pakshon ke bich pichley dinon chale aarope-pratyarope ke daur kaa mudda baithak main uthaa, is par sibbal ne kaha, samaaj ke sadasyon ne hamen bataaya ki unki ore se jo bhi aarope lagaaye gayi, vah samiti main shaamil centre ke pratinidhiyon ke bare main nahin the
 These charges were leveled against people outside the committee
 
 
 hamen ummid he ki bhavishya main sarkaar par vaadakhilaphi karne, dagabaaji karne or jhooth bolne jaise aarope nahin lagaaye jaayenge
 On what was the attitude of the Hazare side in the meeting, the minister said, his attitude was only to discuss
 ham bhi chaahate hai ki ve bebaaki se apni baat rakhen
 When Kejriwal was asked about the meeting, he said, the government is only giving its verdict
 sarkaar hamaari daleelon ko nahin sun rahi he
 The government is very strict and obstinate
 chote muddon par bhi sarkaar sahamat nahin he
 He said that two issues were discussed in today's meeting but consensus could not be reached on a single issue
 pehla mudda varisht adhikariyon par bhrashtachar ke aarope lagane par unke khilaaf vibhageeya or sibiai jaanch ke bajaay swatantra lokapal se ek hi jaanch karaaye jane kaa tha
 The second issue was on the model of Lokpal
 kejariwal ne kaha ki pehle mudde par sarkaar sahamat nahin hui or duusare mudde par sarkaar ne kaha ki 11 sadasyeey prastaavit lokapal hi sabhi maamalon par nirnay karegaa or 11 sadasyeey nikaay ke adheen kaam karne vaale adhikariyon ko jaanch karne ke adhikaar nahin diye jaayenge
 Advocate Prashant Bhushan, who joined the Hazare side of the committee, said, "today's meeting made it clear that there are serious differences between the government and us on many fundamental issues
" ab yah nishkarsh niklaa he ki masaude ke do sanskaran taiyaar honge, jinhen cabinet ke samaksh rakhaa jaayegaa
 He said that the government wants that the investigating officers working under the 11-member Lokpal should not be empowered
 sirf 11 sadasyeey nikaay hi sabhi maamalon se nipate
 However, it is proposed from our side that the officers working under the subordinate body of the 11-member body should also have the powers of independent investigation and their responsibilities should be fixed
 bhushan ne kaha ki hamane sarkaar ko yah bhi bataaya ki sanyukt raashtra kii bhrashtachar nirodhak sandhi main hi yah kaha gaya he ki sarkari naukarshahon ke bhrashtachar kii jaanch ke liye prabhaavshaalee nikaay hona chaiye
 Our demand is no different
 loksabhaa chunaav main narendra modi ke netritv main bijepi ne prachand bahumat ke saath ek baar phir satta main vaapasi kii he
 BJP has managed to feed lotus from Northeast to South India
 congress sahit tamaam vipakshi dalon ke baagi netaa lagaataar bijepi kii takat banate ja rahe hai
 Opposition rebels in Haryana and Uttar Pradesh have emerged as Sanjeevani for the BJP, including Hemant Biswa Sarma in the Northeast, Mukul Roy in West Bengal, SM Krishna in Karnataka
 purvottar main bijepi ke liye hemanth biswa trumpcardpurvottar ke sabhi rajya 'congress mukt' ho chuke hai
 In this year's Lok Sabha elections, BJP and its allies managed to win 18 of the 25 Lok Sabha seats in the northeastern states
 desh main bijepi kii jeet main bhale hi narendra modi or amit shah kaa ahm role rahaa ho, lekin purvottar main camel khilaane main congress ke baagi hemanth biswa sarama bijepi ke liye trumpcard sabit hue hai
 Biswa left the Congress in August 2015 and joined the BJP
 iske baad se lagaataar purvottar main bijepi jeet dar jeet hasil karti ja rahi he
 bjp's savior in Bengal, Mukul Roy, BJP has made a strong place in the politics of West Bengal
 2014 ke baad se rajya main bijepi kaa graph teji se badha he
 As a result of this, BJP has managed to win 18 seats out of the total 42 seats in the Lok Sabha elections this time
 bengal kii siyaasi jameen par camel khilaane main tiemasi ke baagi mukul roy kii ahm bhoomika rahi
 Roy left the TMC last year to join the BJP
 jabaki tiemasi main kabhi mamata banerjee ke baad vah duusare number kii haisiyat rakhte the
 While at TMC, Mukul Roy handled the management up to the booth level
 bengal kii satta ke singhaasana par mamata ke do baar kabiz hone ke peeche mukul roy ke chunavi prabandhan kaa hi kamaal tha
 Now he is with BJP, in such a big challenge for TMC in Bengal
 karnataka main esaem krishna se mili takatkarnataka main bijepi kii jeet ke liye congress ke baagi netaa es em krishna kaa bada role mana ja rahaa he
 Vokkaliga community votes are considered very important in Karnataka politics
 is par ab tak congress kaa prabhutv rahaa lekin is baar kaha ja rahaa he ki vokkaliga ke vot ekamusth bijepi ko mili hai
 SM Krishna is believed to be the major reason behind this because he started the exercise to vote in favor of BJP long back
 isi kaa nateeja he ki karnataka kii 28 siton main se bijepi 26 siten jeetne main kaamyaab rahi he
 Whereas BJP emerged as the single largest party in last year's assembly elections
 haryana main congress ke baagi bane takataharyana kii siyasat main bijepi kaa ecchhatra raaj kaayam ho gaya he
 Whereas before 2014, BJP did not have much interference in Haryana politics
 congress ke baagi choudhary birendra singh or raav indrajit ne bijepi kaa daaman thama or in donon netaaon ne jeet kii ibaarat likhi
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, BJP won 7 out of 10 seats and in the subsequent assembly elections, BJP came to power for the first time with a clean sweep
 is baar ke loksabhaa chunaav main haryana kii sabhi 10 siten jeetne main kaamyaab rahi
 Along with PM Modi, Congress rebel leaders have played an important role in this victory
 uttarakhand main congress ke baagi aae kamauttrakhand kii siyasat main bijepi kaa raajnneetik varchasv puri tarah se kaayam he
 In this year's Lok Sabha elections, BJP has managed to win all five seats
 uttarakhand kii raajnneeti main yah pehali baar he ki jo party satta main he usne sabhi siten jiti ho
 Whereas till then only the opposition party has been winning
 vidhansabha chunaav se ain pehle congress se bagwat kar bijepi kaa daaman thaamne waalon main harak singh ravat or purv siem vijay bahuguna or yashpal arya jaise diggaj shaamil the
 It is believed that with the help of these leaders, BJP has made a tremendous place in Uttarakhand
 uttar pradesh main baagiyon ke sahare mili sattauttar pradesh main bijepi ne congress samet tamaam dalon ke baagi netaaon ko apane saath milaane main kaamyaab rahi thi
 The result of this is that after the SP-BSP alliance in the Lok Sabha elections this time, the BJP has managed to win a big victory
 soobe main 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav se pehle kai dalon ke baagi netaaon ne bijepi main shaamil hue the
 Among them, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, Swami Prasad Maurya, Brijesh Pathak and apart from this many Dalit faces especially the leaders of the Pasi community settled in saffron color
 yahi vajah he ki sapa-basapa kaa jaateey sameekaran koi gul nahin khilaa sakaa
 Book: 'governance for Growth in India' Price: 195 Rupees Writer: APJ Abdul Kalampublication: Former President and well-known scientist Abdul Kalam, Rupa Publication, has done his best to explain different aspects of governance in this book from his experiences and suggestions
 
 kahin na kahin isamen bhi unki pehali kitaab 'agni kii udaan' kii jhalak bhi milti he
 Kalam has made good suggestions for addressing issues like corruption, governance and accountability
 pragatisheel, ashaavadi or sakaaratmak soch se unhone ek aise bharat kaa sapana dekha he, jisase bharat ke har naagarik kaa vikaas sunishchit ho sake
 If you wish, you can bring positive changes in India by using this book as a roadmap
 kitaab padhate samay aapako kahin na kahin lagegaa ki aap in vishyon ko achche se jaanate hai
 The good thing is that all the chapters were written in a point-wise manner which is very easy to understand
 gali mohalle main raajnneeti or chunaavon ko lekar charchaa karne waalon or rashtriya raajnneeti ko kareeb se jaanane waalon ke liye yah kitaab upyogi hogi
 Kalam has roamed all over India and has met about 17 million youth
 'garvanence for growth in india' kitaab ko kalam ne ek doordarshee or vyaavhaarik lahaze main bharat ke vikaas or garvanence ko dhyaan main rakhkar likhaa he
 They are sure that the younger generation can change our existing political system
 ghar se bachche ko karpshan free rahane kii sikh di jaae, to bharat ko karpshan free desh banane se koi nahin roak saktaa
 He has asked the public representatives to adopt the concept of creative leadership
 creative or pashnet leadership main nae-nae vichaaron ke saath saahasik faisle lene ko bhi shaamil kiya janaa chahie
 Giving a good and fresh example of this, he has also mentioned the adventures of famous people like e Sreedharan and Vikram Sarabhai
 kalam ne bacchon main bachapan se hi leadership kaa gun daalane par jor diya he
 Kalam, who has a scientific approach to change the country, has also praised the CAG in this book
 unka maananaa he ki is sanvaidhanik sanstha ne pichley kuch saalon main alag-alag kshetron main kaaphi achche rivyuu die
 But these reviews came at a time when there was no scope for improvement in those areas
 sieji ko system main shaamil hokar samay-samay par apane rivyuu dete rahane chahie, jisase prabhaavshaalee dhang se kaam ho saken
 20 percent of the country's budget is spent on the defense budget
 isliye dephence mishan main bhi paardarshita lani chahie
 Kalam has suggested that the audit team and technical team of the Defense Account Department should work together
 raajnneeti main yuvaaon kii bhoomika ko badhaane ke liye unhone chunaav ayog ko bhi kai suzav die hai
 The parties should include development plans in their manifesto and develop a development manifesto
 chunaav ayog yah sunishchit kare ki jeetne par party ghoshnaa patr ke sabhi vaade ek nirdhaarit samay main puraa kare
 With this, the youth will choose them on the basis of their work and in the coming time they will also want to join politics
 kyon padhein ye kitatiogar aap desh ke liye apane str se kuch chota-bada karnaa chaahate hai to jarur padhein
 Positive thinking to change the system will get new energy
 aapako lagata he ki chaahe jo kar lo system nahin badalane vaala, tab bhi ek baar himmat karke puri pard jaaen
 In my opinion, every public representative should also read this book
 kyon na padhein ye kitatiogar desh ke liye kuch khaas karne main dilchaspee nahin he, raajnneeti or system se khud ko jod nahin pate hai to jahamat na karen
 Kalam narrated In the story, Kalam has also presented many examples of good leadership of his era
 narsimha raav kii sarkaar ke kaarykaal main kalam ne ek ghatana kaa ullekh kiya he
 One day Kalam got a call from Narasimha Rao
 unhone kalam ko apni team ke saath newclear test ke liye taiyaar rahane ko kaha
 At that time Rao's government was going to go and Atal Bihari Vajpayee's government was going to come
 kalam ne likhaa he ki raav ne unhen or vaajapeyi ko bulaakar unke saamne newclear test kii sari ditels dene ko kaha taaki aane vaali sarkaar ko ek smood techover diya ja sake
 Kalam was witness to the incident when the two leaders were forgetting politics and thinking only for the country
 unhone yah bhi likhaa he ki vaajapeyi or raav donon aise saahsee netaa the, jinamein desh ke liye bade faisle lene kaa dam tha
 On the courage, Kalam mentions another incident
 unhone likhaa he ki ek baar jab wo SU-30 MKI air craft uda rahe the
 As the air craft descended, many youth and media persons started talking to them
 ek ne kaha ki aapako 74 saal kii umr main supersonic fiter aircraft ko chalaane main dar nahin laga
 Kalam's answer to this was, during the 40-minute flight, i was busy controlling the instruments and during this time i did not allow fear to enter itself
 is kitaab ke aakhri hisse main kalam ne likhaa he ki sabhi yuva apane lakshya ko ek pej par likhen or vah pej samaaj main ek achche badlaav laane kaa ek pej sabit hona chahie
 Then the change may be to reduce poverty, any scientific discovery or fight against injustice
 aap vah pej kalam ko mail bhi kar sakate hai

 a post shared by Ajay Devgn (@ajaydevgn) on Dec 7, 2016 at 10:30 pm PST jaradaari sahit sankatagrast netaaon pakistan kii supreme court ne sunwaayee karte hue sakht rukh apanaaya or sarkaar se kaha ki piem se baat kar vah maamle main rukh saaf kare
 Along with this, the court has issued a notice of contempt to PM Yusuf Raza Gilani and ordered to appear in the court on January 19
 court ne gilaani ko is baat par avmaananaa notice diya jab atorni general ne court main kaha ki use sarkaar se is sambandh main koi nirdesh nahin diya gaya he ki vah court main kya kahe
 Significantly, the government, surrounded by problems, has approached Parliament for support
 jaradaari par bhrashtachar ke maamle kii sunwaayee desh kii supreme court kar rahi he
 a judicial commission set up by the apex court to investigate mysterious memos seeking help from the US to prevent a military coup that was feared last year in Pakistan continues
 samajha jaataa he ki sansad ke nichle sadan neshnal assembly main us prastaav par aaj matdaan hoga jisamen loktantr ko majboot karne ke liye raajnneetik netritv dwaara kiye gaye prayaason par manjuuri or samarthan maanga gaya he
 While the Parliament will consider the proposal, on the other hand, a 17-member bench of the Supreme Court is hearing a complaint regarding reopening of corruption cases against those with influence
 rasookh vaale logon ke khilaaf bhrashtachar ke maamalon ko varsh 2007 main tatkaaleen sainya shaasha parvej musharraf ne rashtriya sulah sahmati adhyadesh (enarao) ke tahat band kar diya tha
 pakistani-american industrialist Mansoor Ijaz made this memo public and created a storm in political circles
 ijaaj aaj ayog ke samaksh gavaahi dene ke liye pesh nahin hue or unhone 25 janvari tak kaa samay maanga he
 Explain that last week, the top court warned that action could be taken against Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani and President Asif Ali Zardari if the government continues to disobey its order on the NRO issue
 adaalat ne kaha tha ki gilaani pad grahan karte samay lee gai shapath kaa sammaan na karne ke kaaran eemaandaar vyakti nahin ho sakate
 The apex court also warned that if the President violates his oath of office, he may face the same result

 But the government refused to do so, stating that the president was exempt from the constitution

 It must have felt that it could not have formed an oval collage of Manju sir's picture from the square Rubik's cube
 manjunath ne upi ke lakhimpur khiri main ek bhrasht petrol pump ko sil kar diya tha, lekin indian oil corporation ke is eemaandaar afasar ko hatyaron ne maar diya
 IIM went to Lucknow on Saturday

 How well the cleaning system is already in the East MCD can be gauged from the fact that last year the East MCD was ranked 196 better than all three mcds, then this year the East MCD has reached 341 rank and behind it One of the biggest reasons for this is the repeated strike of the cleaning workers

 It is possible that information about 3232 trucks is not available or that one can fill wrong information about such a large number of trucks in the government register
 punjab main sieji ne ek report di he jise march maheene ke bajet satr main vidhansabha main pesh kiya gaya
 When the CAG started to find out about 3319 trucks from 2009 to 2013, they were disappointed because only 87 vehicles were detected, but 15 of them were not
 scooter, motorcycle or car vagairah ke number the
 No sign of 3232 trucks was detected
 mandi se jab anaaj uthta he godaam le jane ke liye to badi sankhya main trakon kaa istemaal hota he
 Certainly, no one would take away wheat or rice bags on scooters and motorcycles
 lekin kya yah sambhav he ki 3319 trakon kaa pataa hi na chale
 When the truck reaches the warehouse with the goods, the receipt of its number is deducted
 itani badi maatra main galati to ho nahin sakati
 If it had happened, then how would that truck have taken money in lieu of that receipt
 yani raseed bhi farzi or paise kaa bhugtan bhi farji
 The CAG has stated that 7 out of 16 officials of four government agencies have not given any data on how many trucks were used and their numbers
 ummid he punjab sarkaar in trakon kii talash kar rahi hogi
 The Government of India, through the Reserve Bank of India, gives money to Punjab to purchase paddy and wheat
 rigerv bank se paisa pahunchataa he bhartiya state bank sahit 30 bainkon ke paas
 Now the Punjab Government for Food Corporation of India, or FCI, starts the process of purchasing food grains
 paisa milte hi punjab sarkaar aadhati se kahati he ki wo kisaanon se gehun kharide
 The agent used to tell the government through the mandis that he has bought so much
 sarkaar bank ko bataati he ki falaan mandi main itane lakh ton genhu kii kharid ho gai he
 In return, the bank immediately gives money to the state government
 rajya sarkaar 48 ghante ke bheetar aadhati ke khate main paisa bhej detii he, taaki kisaanon ko jaldi paisa mil sake
 However, at this point the government can also consider sending money directly to the farmers' account

 When the agent procures, the agencies bring trucks to take it to the warehouse
 iske liye punjab main paanch chah agenciyaan hai
 These trucks reach the warehouse with grain and there is a receipt that how much goods were brought and from which trucks
 mandi main kitna kharida gaya or godaam main kitna pahunchaa, iskaa alag-alag data rakhaa jaataa he
 These are then matched
 yahi milan hua to pataa chalaa ki jitna anaaj mandi main kharida gaya utana to godaam main pahunchaa hi nahin
 i told you this thick so that you can understand the process
 'iconomik times' ne to is par kai khabaren chhaapi hai
 According to him, the group of 30 banks associated with procurement in Punjab is not getting the stock of 12,000 crore stock
 khabar ai ki bainkon ne pataa chalate hi is sijan main kareed ke baad bhugtan roak diya
 Punjab says that the money received from the Center to buy food grains has not been misused anywhere
 ye anaaj central pool main jaataa he yani bhartiya khaadya nigam ko de diya jaataa he or baqayda iskaa ricard rakhaa jaataa he
 If this is the case then why did the Reserve Bank of India need to worry
 kai baar epasiai bhi sidhe mandi se anaaj uthaakar apane trakon se duusare rajyon main bhijwa detii he
 Therefore, FCI should also be told that the truck which is not getting the accounts of Rs 12000 crore wheat, took its truck somewhere
 gaye bhi yaa nahin gaye
 There is no trace of more than 3000 trucks
 is masale ko lekar mukhyamantri badal ne pradhanmantri se mulaakaat bhi kii he
 But the banks are upset where so much money went
 agar sarkaar ke godaam main stock nahin he to kahaan gaya
 Then who was given the money
 agar hisaab nahin milegaa to bank apane khate main itani badi rakam ko kaise dikhaayenge
 According to the 'economic Times', banks asked Punjab to tell the entire plan how you will pay this money and give the account of the stock because if this calculation is not found then the banks will have to declare a bad loan of 1800 to 3000 crores

 bhartiya reserve bank ke zariye bharat sarkaar punjab ko paise detii he ki wo apane yahaan dhan or gehun kii kharid kare
 Money from the Reserve Bank reaches 30 banks including State Bank of India
 ab bhartiya khaadya nigam yani epasiai ke liye punjab sarkaar anaaj kharidne kaa kaam shuru kar detii he
 As soon as the money is received, the Punjab government asks the agent to buy wheat from the farmers
 aadhati karidakar mandiyon ke zariye sarkaar ko bataa detaa he ki itani kareed hui
 The government tells the bank that so many tonnes of wheat has been procured in such and such market
 uske evaj main bank turant rajya sarkaar ko paisa de detaa he
 The state government sends the money within 48 hours to the account of the agent, so that the farmers can get the money quickly
 vaise sarkaar is bindu par bhi kisaanon ke khate main sidhe paise bhejne par vichaar kar sakati he
 Well 
 
 aadhati jab kareed letaa he to ise godaam main le jane ke liye agenciyaan trek lekar aa jaati hai
 There are five agencies in Punjab for this
 ye trek anaaj lekar godaam pahunchate hai or vahaan raseed milti he ki kitna maal lekar aae or kis trek se aae
 Separate data is kept of how much was purchased in the market and how much arrived in the warehouse
 phir inkaa milan kiya jaataa he
 When this was matched, it was found that the amount of grain purchased in the market did not reach the warehouse
 ye maine motaa moti aapako bataaya taaki aap prakriya ko samaj saken
 The Economic Times has published many news on this
 uske anusaar punjab main kharid se jude 30 bainkon ke samooh ko 12,000 karod ke stock kaa hisaab nahin mil rahaa he
 The news came that the banks stopped payments after buying this season as soon as they came to know
 punjab kaa kahana he ki centre se jo anaaj kharidne ke liye paise mili the unka kahin bhi galat istemaal nahin hua he
 This grain goes to the central pool, which is given to the Food Corporation of India and the record is kept
 agar aisa he to bhartiya rigerv bank ko chintaa karne kii kyon zarurat padi
 Many times FCI also picks up grain directly from the mandi and sends its trucks to other states
 lihaaza epasiai ko bhi bataanaa chahie ki 12000 karod rupee ke gehun kaa jo hisaab nahin mil rahaa he kya uske trek lekar kahin gaye
 Whether gone or not
 3000 se adhik trakon kaa to ata-pataa hi nahin mil rahaa he
 Chief Minister Badal has also met the Prime Minister on this issue
 lekin bank pareshaan hai ki itnaa paisa kahaan gaya
 If there is no stock in the government's warehouse then where did it go? phir paisa kise diya gaya
 If the account is not available, how will the banks show such a large amount in their account
 'iconomik times' ke anusaar bainkon ne punjab se kaha ki puraa plan bataaiye ki kaise aap is paise kaa bhugtan karenge or stock kaa hisaab denge kyonki agar yah hisaab nahin mila to bainkon ko 1800 se 3000 karod kaa bed lone ghoshit karnaa hoga
 So, they are not able to catch a Vijay Mallya yet
 itani badi rakam ko yaa to bhul janaa hoga yaa kai prakaar ke gumnaam, agyaat maalyaon kii talash main gaadi lekar nikalnaa hoga
 'economic Times' reported on April 19 by Sangeeta Mehta and Saloni Shukla, the Reserve Bank of India has told banks that a large part of the loan they have given to Punjab may be non-performing assets
 punjab sarkaar ko bainkon ne anaaj kharidne ke liye 12000 karod rupee kaa lone diya tha
 The Punjab government says that only food grains have been purchased for the country with these funds
 kendriya vitt rajya mantri jayant sinha ne bhi mana he ki jo godaam main stock he or jitna hona chahie isamen kaaphi antar he
 According to the newspaper, Sinha did not answer in detail whether this could happen in other states as well
 unhone kaha ki isiilie hamen vyapak samaadhaan khojane kii zarurat he
 Due to this, the payment of farmers is getting delayed
 sangrur zile ke aasapaas kii mandiyon main sankat gaharaa gaya he
 We found out the condition of the three mandis of Sangrur
 sangrur, dhuree or laharaa
 Here the artisans and farmers told that two weeks of selling wheat had come, but the money was not received
 aam taur par 24 se 48 ghante main paise mil jaaya karte the
 There are 16 mandis around Sangrur
 har jagah yahi kahani he
 a motto of Sangrur mandi told the phone that he had bid for the 11th, but payment has not been received till 20 April i
e
 Wednesday
 unhone 200 kisaanon se 40,000 gehun kii boriyaan kharidi hai
 Have sent bill of three crores to the mandi board, but if the money has not come, where to give it to the farmer
 kai achhatiyon se baat kar pataa chalaa ki sangrur kii 16 mandiyon main kareeb 12 lakh boriyon padi hai or unka paisa nahin aayaa he
 The laborers working in the mandis along with the farmers are also not getting the money
 november-disambar ke bhi inke paise baaki hai
 The rate of 1 rupee 58 paise for lifting a sack
 pichhali baar kaa ek rupaya to mil gaya he lekin har bori par 58 paise ke hisaab se paise nahin mili hai
 Due to this, the performance of the agencies coming to raise wheat is showing slowness
 sangrur main hi kareeb chaar hazaar pravasi or sthaneey mazdoor isse prabhavit bataaye ja rahe hai
 Many farmers have left, but still a large number of farmers are camping in the mandis that if money comes, they will go home
 kisaanon ko bhi tractor se lekar gehun kaatane kii mashin carbine kaa kiraaya dena hota he
 The loan from school fees to ration is different
 kisaanon ko bhi bainkon ke kisht chukaane hote hai
 Three to four lakh rupees of each farmer is with the arhatis and crores of crores of rupees are owed to the government
 tippaniyan We also got to know the market of Muktsar, the district house of Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal
 ye gidadbah mandi he
 From here, the government lifted 7 lakh 90 thousand sacks and took them to the godowns, yet if the farmers have not been paid yet, if they calculate it, then it will sit around 59 crore
 85,000 boriyaan mandi main hi padi hai
 There are around 56 mandis in Muktsar
 chaar badi mandi he or 52 ke kareeb choti or majhole kism kii mandiyaan hai
 This is more or less the story of every market
 hazaron kisaan do hafte se paise kaa intazaar kar rahe hai
 Here also the adhatiyas say that no money is coming from the government
 20 april ke 'times of india' main rohan dua ne likhaa he ki punjab sarkaar ne abhi tak chaaval milon se 1300 karod rupee nahin vasule hai
 The CAG report states that several miles including Jalandhar, Ludhiana, Sangrur, Mohali and Fatehgarh have revealed that there is a huge difference in the stocks that are held and the money taken from banks against them
 sieji ke anusaar milon ko phayda pahunchane ke liye paisa to de diya gaya magar maal kaa pataa hi nahin chal rahaa he
 The farmers of Punjab are in trouble
 'indian express' ne to report kiya he ki ab to punjab main aadhati bhi aatmahatya karne lage hai
 How to find those 3000 trucks
 kya unka vigyaapan nikaala jaae, 12000 karod ke stock kaa hisaab nahin mil rahaa he, kya ye hisaab kitaab kaa purana jhamela he yaa koi ghotaalaa he
 The government tells the bank that so many tonnes of wheat has been procured in such and such market
 uske evaj main bank turant rajya sarkaar ko paisa de detaa he
 The state government sends the money within 48 hours to the account of the agent, so that the farmers can get the money quickly
 vaise sarkaar is bindu par bhi kisaanon ke khate main sidhe paise bhejne par vichaar kar sakati he
 Well 
 
 aadhati jab kareed letaa he to ise godaam main le jane ke liye agenciyaan trek lekar aa jaati hai
 There are five agencies in Punjab for this
 ye trek anaaj lekar godaam pahunchate hai or vahaan raseed milti he ki kitna maal lekar aae or kis trek se aae
 Separate data is kept of how much was purchased in the market and how much arrived in the warehouse
 phir inkaa milan kiya jaataa he
 When this was matched, it was found that the amount of grain purchased in the market did not reach the warehouse
 ye maine motaa moti aapako bataaya taaki aap prakriya ko samaj saken
 The Economic Times has published many news on this
 uske anusaar punjab main kharid se jude 30 bainkon ke samooh ko 12,000 karod ke stock kaa hisaab nahin mil rahaa he
 The news came that the banks stopped payments after buying this season as soon as they came to know
 punjab kaa kahana he ki centre se jo anaaj kharidne ke liye paise mili the unka kahin bhi galat istemaal nahin hua he
 This grain goes to the central pool, which is given to the Food Corporation of India and the record is kept
 agar aisa he to bhartiya rigerv bank ko chintaa karne kii kyon zarurat padi
 Many times FCI also picks up grain directly from the mandi and sends its trucks to other states
 lihaaza epasiai ko bhi bataanaa chahie ki 12000 karod rupee ke gehun kaa jo hisaab nahin mil rahaa he kya uske trek lekar kahin gaye
 Whether gone or not
 3000 se adhik trakon kaa to ata-pataa hi nahin mil rahaa he
 Chief Minister Badal has also met the Prime Minister on this issue
 lekin bank pareshaan hai ki itnaa paisa kahaan gaya
 If there is no stock in the government's warehouse then where did it go? phir paisa kise diya gaya
 If the account is not available, how will the banks show such a large amount in their account
 'iconomik times' ke anusaar bainkon ne punjab se kaha ki puraa plan bataaiye ki kaise aap is paise kaa bhugtan karenge or stock kaa hisaab denge kyonki agar yah hisaab nahin mila to bainkon ko 1800 se 3000 karod kaa bed lone ghoshit karnaa hoga
 So, they are not able to catch a Vijay Mallya yet
 itani badi rakam ko yaa to bhul janaa hoga yaa kai prakaar ke gumnaam, agyaat maalyaon kii talash main gaadi lekar nikalnaa hoga
 'economic Times' reported on April 19 by Sangeeta Mehta and Saloni Shukla, the Reserve Bank of India has told banks that a large part of the loan they have given to Punjab may be non-performing assets
 punjab sarkaar ko bainkon ne anaaj kharidne ke liye 12000 karod rupee kaa lone diya tha
 The Punjab government says that only food grains have been purchased for the country with these funds
 kendriya vitt rajya mantri jayant sinha ne bhi mana he ki jo godaam main stock he or jitna hona chahie isamen kaaphi antar he
 According to the newspaper, Sinha did not answer in detail whether this could happen in other states as well

 Due to this, the payment of farmers is getting delayed

 kai achhatiyon se baat kar pataa chalaa ki sangrur kii 16 mandiyon main kareeb 12 lakh boriyon padi hai or unka paisa nahin aayaa he
 The laborers working in the mandis along with the farmers are also not getting the money

 The rate of 1 rupee 58 paise for lifting a sack
 pichhali baar kaa ek rupaya to mil gaya he lekin har bori par 58 paise ke hisaab se paise nahin mili hai
 Due to this, the performance of the agencies coming to raise wheat is showing slowness
 sangrur main hi kareeb chaar hazaar pravasi or sthaneey mazdoor isse prabhavit bataaye ja rahe hai
 Many farmers have left, but still a large number of farmers are camping in the mandis that if money comes, they will go home
 kisaanon ko bhi tractor se lekar gehun kaatane kii mashin carbine kaa kiraaya dena hota he
 The loan from school fees to ration is different
 kisaanon ko bhi bainkon ke kisht chukaane hote hai
 Three to four lakh rupees of each farmer is with the arhatis and crores of crores of rupees are owed to the government
 tippaniyan We also got to know the market of Muktsar, the district house of Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal

 From here, the government lifted 7 lakh 90 thousand sacks and took them to the godowns, yet if the farmers have not been paid yet, if they calculate it, then it will sit around 59 crore
 85,000 boriyaan mandi main hi padi hai
 There are around 56 mandis in Muktsar

 The farmers of Punjab are in trouble
 'indian express' ne to report kiya he ki ab to punjab main aadhati bhi aatmahatya karne lage hai
 How to find those 3000 trucks
 kya unka vigyaapan nikaala jaae, 12000 karod ke stock kaa hisaab nahin mil rahaa he, kya ye hisaab kitaab kaa purana jhamela he yaa koi ghotaalaa he
 But the banks are upset where so much money went
 agar sarkaar ke godaam main stock nahin he to kahaan gaya
 Then who was given the money
 agar hisaab nahin milegaa to bank apane khate main itani badi rakam ko kaise dikhaayenge
 According to the 'economic Times', banks asked Punjab to tell the entire plan how you will pay this money and give the account of the stock because if this calculation is not found then the banks will have to declare a bad loan of 1800 to 3000 crores
 lihaaza abhi to ve ek vijay maalya ko nahin pakad paa rahe hai
 Such a large amount has to be either forgotten or one has to take a car in search of many anonymous, unknown Mallyas
 'iconomik times' main 19 april ko sangeeta mehta or saloni shukla kii report he, bhartiya rigerv bank ne bainkon se kaha he ki unhone punjab ko jo karja diya he uskaa ek bada hissaa non parforming asset ho saktaa he
 Banks were given a loan of Rs 12000 crore to buy food grains to the Punjab government
 punjab sarkaar kahati he ki in paison se desh ke liye anaaj hi kharide gaye hai
 Union Minister of State for Finance Jayant Sinha has also admitted that there is a big difference between what is in stock in the warehouse and what it should be
 akhbaar ke anusaar sinha ne vistaar se jawaab nahin diya ki kya aisa anya rajyon main bhi ho saktaa he
 He said that is why we need to find a comprehensive solution
 iske kaaran kisaanon ke bhugtan main deree hoti ja rahi he
 The crisis has deepened in the mandis surrounding Sangrur district
 hamane sangrur kii teen mandiyon kaa haal pataa kiya
 Sangrur, Dhuri and Lehra
 yahaan achhatiyon or kisaanon ne bataaya ki gehun bechney ke do hafte hone ko aae magar paise nahin mili hai
 Money was usually received within 24 to 48 hours
 sangrur ke aasapaas 16 mandiyaan hai
 This is the story everywhere
 sangrur kii mandi ke ek aadhati ne phone par bataaya ki 11 tarikh kii unki boli lagi thi magar 20 april yani buudhvaar tak pement nahin mili he
 He has purchased 40,000 wheat sacks from 200 farmers
 mandi board ko teen karod kaa bill bhej bhi diya he magar paisa aayaa hi nahin to kisaan ko kahaan se den
 After talking to several adhatiyas, it was found that about 12 lakh sacks are lying in 16 mandis of Sangrur and their money has not arrived kisaanon ke saath mandiyon main kaam karne vaale mazdooron ko bhi paise nahin mil rahe hai
 They also have money left for november-december
 ek bori uthaane ke 1 rupee 58 paise kaa rate he
 One rupee has been received from the last time but 58 paise has not been received on every sack
 is kaaran gehun uthaane aa rahi agenciyon ke pradarshan main susti dikh rahi he
 In Sangrur itself, about four thousand migrants and local laborers are said to be affected by it
 kai kisaan to chale gaye magar ab bhi badi sankhya main kisaan mandiyon main hi deraa daale hue hai ki paisa aayega to ghar jaayenge
 Farmers also have to pay from tractor to wheat cutting machine carbine
 skool kii fees se lekar rashan kaa udhaar alag
 Farmers also have to pay the installments of banks
 ek-ek kisaan ke teen se chaar lakh rupee achhatiyon ke paas he or achhatiyon ke karodon rupee sarkaar ke paas bakaayaa hai
 The comments hamane mukhyamantri prakaash singh badal ke grih zile muktsar kii mandi kaa bhi haal pataa kiya
 This is Giddarbah Mandi
 yahaan se sarkaar 7 lakh 90 hazaar boriyon uthaakar godaamon main le gayi phir bhi kisaanon ko abhi tak bhugtan nahin hua he iskaa hisaab lagaayenge to kareeb 59 karod ke aasapaas baithegaa

 — taran adarsh (@taran_adarsh)june 16, 2014 While filling up Rahul Gandhi's nomination papers, the BJP attacked the Congress sharply, while senior Congress leaders are calling it bjp's nervousness
 congressi ke anusaar gujarat main rahul gandhi ko mil rahe samarthan se bijepi pareshaan ho gai he
 After the nomination for the post of President of the Congress Party by Ashok Gehlot Nerahul Gandhi said that the party will move forward under the leadership of Kirahul Gandhi
 rahulne pichley kai saal se party ko aage badhaane ke liye kaaphi mehnat kii he
 The way Rahul Gandhi is getting support in Gujarat, it is clear that the Congress will win in Gujarat
 shivaraj patil ne kaha kiraahul gandhiunaav lard rahe hai
 Whatever the process of contesting the election, the nomination is filled
 puri prakriya kaa anusaran kiya jayega
 Whoever wants to contest elections can fight
 bijepi ke dianasti ke aarope par shivaraj patil kaa kahana he ki vah bijepi ke in aaropon main dam nahin dekhte hai
 Because there is an electoral process in Congress
 iske tahat hi vah chunaav lard rahe hai
 As far as the formation of the new team Rahul is concerned
 jab bhi koi nayaa adhyaksh banataa he, vah apni team banaata he
 On senior leaders and young leaders in the team, Shivraj said that naturally the new people, the junior ones, get a chance and the senior people are slightly behind
 lekin anubhav or yuva iskaa donon kaa mishran lekarrahul gandhichalenge
 Sheila Dixit said that Kirahul Gandhi has made it clear that both old and young leaders, they need them and will take both of them along in the party
 puraane logon kaa anubhav or yuva netaaon kaa josh party ko aage le jane main madad karegaa
 As far as the work of Rahul Gandhi is concerned, he has a glimpse of the work of his father, Gandhi and grandmother Indira Gandhi and his mother Sonia Gandhi
 saath main unhone party main kai varshon se kaam bhi kiya he
 All these things will be helpful in strengthening the party
 yuva netaa sachin payalat or rajeev shukla ne bijepi par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki bijepi main koun adhyaksh banataa he or vah kis tarah se kaam karata he, usamen congress dakhal nahin detii
 In such a situation, why is BJP or Prime Minister Narendra Modi worrying about Korahul Gandhi becoming the president
 bijepi kyon pareshaani ho rahi he
 In fact, the overwhelming support of Rahul Gandhi in Gujarat has become the reason for his trouble
 rajyasabha main vipaksh ke netaa gulam nabi aaazaad ne bhi kaha kiraahul gandhike adhyaksh banane se party or aage badhegi
 As far as the new leaders and old leaders are concerned, all together will strengthen the party
 rahul gandhiin tamaam logon ko saath lekar chalenge
 These days, Madhuri Dixit Nene, who is judging the TV dance reality show Dance Deewane, has expressed her pain related to personal life on this show
 kisne kaha tha- jo sanju cancer kii shikaar bivi kaa nahin hua, wo maadhuri kaa kya hogamadhuri kaa kahana he ki kabhi-kabhi unke donon bete bhi unhen ahmiyat nahin dete hai
 According to a statement, Kishan, one of the contestants of the show 'dance Deewane', brought tears to the eyes of the people while dedicating his performance to his mother
 tabhi is prastuti ke baad kishan ne kaha, 'mujhe apni maa ke phone ko nazarandaaj karne or unako ahmiyat nahin dene kaa pachhtaawaa he
 'madhuri Dixit said in Sidhi Baat- My children do not watch my movies, nor is Fan Hanadhuri saying in his reply,' Sometimes my sons don't even give me importance and i feel bad when i see them again and again i keep calling but i can't do anything
 ' maadhuri ne aage kaha ki baat yah he ki is duniya main har maa apane bacchon ko lekar behad protective hoti he
 'he said,' i used to do the same when i was younger, but now that i am a mother, i know what it feels like
 ' Prime Minister Manmohan Singh termed BJP leader LK Advani's remarks as indecent and unfortunate
 adwani ne samprag-2 sarkaar ko nazaij kaha tha
 When reporters were asked to react to Advani's remarks in the Lok Sabha on the premises of the Prime Minister, he said, "the remarks are indecent and unfortunate
 ’adwani kii tippanee se nichle sadan main hangaamaa ho gaya or satta paksh ke kade pratirodh ke baad bhaajapa netaa ko apni tippanee waapas leni padi
 However, Advani later clarified that he was referring to the vote of confidence in 2008, in which crores of rupees were spent to save the government
 britain ke doctor apane marijon ko sidhe mulaakaat karne ke bajaay beemaari ke lakshna kii jaankaree i-mail se bhejne kii salaah de rahe hai
 It is part of the campaign to save around one billion pounds every year from Britain's 'national Health Service'
 daily express ke report ke anusaar, marijon kii ore se bheje gaye i-mail sandesh doctor khaali vakt main yaa phir din ke ant main dekhenge
 People struggling with heart disease, diabetes and lung diseases can be asked to check their blood pressure and send it too
 is pariyojna ke tahat filhaal cornwell, kent or purvi landan main lambey samay se bimariyon se jujh rahe kareeb 6,000 marijon ko liya gaya he
 All the patients have been given electronic machines so that they can do all the tests before the operation, the result will be published at the end of the year
 is yojana main doctor agar marij kii report se santusht hoga tabhi use oparation ke liye bulaaegaa
 If the operation will not be needed, then the doctor will tell him the necessary medicines and advice through e-mail
 england ke wicketiper ballebaaj mat praayar ne chaar saal baad saaf kiya ki unhone 2007 kii shrunkhlaa main trentbrij test ke dauraan bhartiya ballebaaj sachin tendulkar par chhintakashi nahin kii thi
 In the reports, Prior was accused of telling Tendulkar, "I drive a Porsche, what car do you drive?" praayar ne ab in reporton ko galat bataaya
 He said, i am also accused for things i did not do
 jaise ki pich par jelly been phenkna or sachin tendulkar ke khilaaf porsh car ko lekar bakawaas tippanee karnaa
 This is completely nonsense
 trentbrij test match main jahir khan jab ballebaaji ke liye aa rahe the, tab praayar par pich par jelly been phenkane kaa aarope lagaaya gaya tha
 The central government has decided to provide 10 percent reservation to the economically weaker sections of the general category
 sarkaar bhale hi aarthik rup se kamjor general varg ke logon ko aarakshan dekar unka utthan karne kaa daawa kar rahi ho, lekin isse pehle daliton ko mili aarakshan se unki bhagidaaribahut zyada nahin bad pai he
 At least some figures show this
 kaha jaataa he ki daliton ko aarakshan milane se unhen sarkari naukariyon main zyada avasar milte hai or unki bhagidaari kaaphi zyada hoti he
 However, the reality at the ground level is different
 sawaal uth rahe hai ki kya ye sach he ki aarakshan se pichde hi pichde bhar gaye hai? kya ye sach heki aarakshan se dalit hi dalit bhar gaye hai?haal hi main ek angreji akhbaar ko soochna ke adhikaar ke tahat mili jaankaree main in sawaalon ke jawaab saamne aae
 Actually, the information found in RTI is quite different from the principle of reservation for social justice
 dekhen kya kehete hai aankade
 
 
 The truth of reservation in central universities of the country? Tell us that there are a total of 40 central universities in the country, out of which 11486 are teaching and 5835 are non-teaching staff
 saath hi in 40 kendriya vishvavidhyalayon main 1125 professor hai or inamen dalit professor 39 yani 3

 What is the condition of associate professor? If you talk about associate professor, the condition of associate professor in 40 central universities is even more shocking

 At the same time, there is not a single backward class associate professor in the country

 There are a total of 343777 posts in 71 departments, of which 51384 (14
 94%) pichde or 216408 (62

 - maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantralay main kul 665 pad hai, jisamen 56 (8

 25%) are upper caste employees
 - raashtrapati sachivalay main kul 130 pad hai, jisamen 10 (7
 69%) backward and 97 (74
 62%) savarna karmchaaree hai
 According to this information, the total count of the upper castes being 50 percent is reversed and the minimum of the backward is 27
 5 fisad hone kaa hisaab bhi sahi nahin baithta
 At the same time, till 1 April 2018, after the reservation of 28 years in any department of any central university of India, there was not a single backward caste professor and associate professor of backward classes
 vahiin, assistant professor arakshit seat se aadhe hi hai
 The data shows that as per the rules, the appointment of reserved candidates has not been done on the fixed posts and the appointment of general category candidates is more than the maximum limit

 bina ye dekhe ki gend kitni dur gai he petersan daud pade
 By the time he returned to his crease, wicketkeeper Sanju Samson had hit a direct throw
 squaire leg par khadey ampire sanjay hajaare ne unhen noteout qaraar de diya
 Umpires may take the help of a third umpire even on the slightest doubt for a runout
 lekin sanjay hajaare ne apni ankhon par bharosa karte hue petersan ko noteout qaraar de diya
 However, it was clear at the replays that Peterson had not reached the crease
 is galat faisle kaa dilli ke captain petersan zyada phayda nahin uthaa sake or 14 ran banaakar out ho gaye the
 After this, there were lots of jokes on this decision of Sanjay Hazare on Twitter

 Mahadev resides in Kashi, the city of Shiva
 yahaan baba vishwanath ke do mandir behad khaas hai
 The first Vishwanath temple which occupies the ninth place among the 12 Jyotirlingas, while the second one is called the new Vishwanath temple
 yah mandir kaashi vishvavidhyalay ke praangan main sthit he
 The city of Kashi, the fallen Pavani, settled on the banks of the Ganges
 yah bhi kaha jaataa he ki kaashi nagari devadidev mahadev kii trishul par basii he
 In the scriptures and the Puranas, which have been called the city of salvation which has been echoing from the cheers of Baba Vishwanath's devotees since eternity, is the destination of the devotees of Shiva who have been coming here in search of salvation for centuries
 kaashi kii is yatra par ham aapako mahadev ke do aise roopon ke darshan karaayenge, jinhen baba vishwanath ke naam se pukaara jaataa he
 You must be thinking that how are two forms of naive in the same city by the same name? We will also tell you about the glory and importance of Baba Vishwanath, who is seated at the Kashi Hindu University in Varanasi
 kaashi vishwanath mandir ke archak shrikant mishra kehete hai ki 12 jyotirlingon main kaashi vishwanath kaa nauvaan sthaan he
 It is believed that if a devotee attends the court of Baba Vishwanath, he gets freedom from the cycle of birth after birth
 baba kaa aashirwad apane bhakton ke liye moksh kaa dwaar khol detaa he
 It is believed that Lord Shiva appeared in a dream to a devotee and said that after bathing in the Ganges, he will get two Shivalingas and when he joins them and will establish them, then the divine Shivalinga of Shiva and Shakti will be established and since then Lord Shiva sits here with mother Parvati
 ek duusari manyata ke mutabik, maa bhagwati ne khud mahadev ko yahaan sthapit kiya tha
 Aarti is performed four times throughout the day with Mangla Aarti in the early morning in the temple of Baba Vishwanath
 manyata he ki somvaar ko chadaaye gaye jal kaa punya adhik miltaa he
 Especially in the monsoon of Sawan, Jalabhishek has its own significance
 shrikant mishra kehete hai ki sawan kaa har din paavan he or is dauraan jal chadhaane se baba prasann hote hai
 There are stories full of miracles in every particle of Kashi, but by coming to this abode of Baba Vishwanath, all the wishes of the devotees are fulfilled and life is blessed
 ek taraf shiv ke viraat or behad durlabh rup ke darshanon kaa saubhaahgya miltaa he, vahiin ganga main snaan kar sabhi paap dhul jate hai
 The new Kashi Vishwanath temple in the Kashi Hindu University campus is new to say, but the importance of this temple is as much as that of the old Kashi Vishwanath
 kehete hai yahaan aakar bhole bhandari ke darshan kar jisane bhi rudrabhishek kar liya, uski sabhi muraadein ho jaati hai
 The doors of salvation open for him
 yahaan devgan virajte hai or ganga kii dhar bahati he, wo paramtirth varanasi kehalaata he
 The pain of devotees is removed by coming here only
 tan-man ko aseem shanti milti he
 Because here Lord Shiva himself sits
 kaashi hindu vishvavidhyalay ke praangan main kaashi ke raja kahe jane vaale bhagwaan shiv ke darshan hote hai, jinhen bhakt baba vishwanath ke naam se hi pukaarte hai

 According to preliminary information, this accident has occurred due to the broken track
 saath hi train main puraani takanic vaale (intigral coach factory) isief coach the, yahi vajah rahi ki ek baad ek 13 dabbe patari se utar gaye
 Modernization initiatives: After the recent train accidents, the railway coaches were modernized and started their retro-fitment
 railway agle chah saalon main 40,000 isief coach main badlaav karke surakshit yatra ke liye feet karne kaa faisla kiya he
 About 8000 crore rupees will have to be spent in this work in the next six years
 railway ke mutabikpurani takanic par aadhaaritisief coach ke utpaadan ko 1 april 2018 se puri tarah se band kar diya jayega
 Railway coach factories across the country have been instructed to redesign the interior of the old coach
 iske liye agle chah varshon kaa target bhi tay kar diya gaya he
 1000 ICF coaches will be retro-fitted during the year 2017-18
 varsh 2018-19 main 3000 isief coach ko retro-feet kar diya jayega
 Control could have been made to make the ICF coach safe for passengers, its coupler will be converted into a central buffer coupler in the railway workshop

 The boxes are not mounted on each other
 When the Kaifiyat Express derailed near Etawah, it has LHB coaches made of German technology
 isi vajah se train ke dibbe ek duusare ke upar nahin chadhe
 Apart from this, due to other security features, people also suffered less serious injuries
 alechabi coach hone kii vajah se is durghatana main ghayalon kii sankhya kam rahi or kisi bhi vyakti kii maut nahin hui thi
 Significantly, the number of casualties in the Utkal Express accident in Khatauli was more because the old technology coaches were kept in this train

 i was working in the office when suddenly news of terrorist Naved was caught
 mere ghar se phone aayaa to maine kaha- main abhi bahut biji hum
 Terrorist caught, talk later
 phone par hi fat se sawaal daaga gaya ki koun aatanki-kaisaa aatanki
 i said, Naveed has been caught from Udhampur in Jammu and Kashmir
 gaanv waalon ne pakadava diya
 One died, the other was caught alive
 tabhi aawaaj ai chalo-chalo baaki baat ghar par aakar karte hai
 When i reached home, i got to hear - Hey, how do you talk on the phone? kisne kaha tha aatanki ke bare main bataane ko
 If your phone is getting taped somewhere? Then i realize that maybe my phone is getting taped
 main to phone par badi hi normal baat kar rahi thi
 Then why did i think, because i am Muslim, maybe this fear is sitting in my family or in my entire community
 bharat aaj apniazadee kii 69veen saalagirahamana rahaa he par lagata he ki is desh main kuch hi logon ko ye aazaadee naseeb hui he

 is tarah kii line sunne kii aadat si ho gai he, yakeen maniye ab agar tej hansane par koi toke nahin to lagata he main kahin akele to nahin hans rahi thi
 Do i not have the freedom to laugh and speak? 
 
 
 i remember many years ago when i was preparing for the entrance of Mass Com
 mujhase ghar par kaha gaya hamane bahut sochaa lekin tum ye course nahin kar sakati
 This course is not made for girls, stay out of the house late at night, talk about politics and politicians, work in the office overnight, let us do it too, but the one who will get married to you will not let you do better Go to the line of shaadi ke baad koi pareshaani nahin hogi, apane pati or bacchon kaa khyaal rakh sakogi, ghar par rahogi, puraa samay de paaogi or kya chahie
 After this discussion, two questions arose in my mind, am i not free to choose my choice? kya shaadi kaa matlab hi sirf bediyaan hota he
 After all, why the things that i am expected to do are not being done by my spouse
 aakhir umr bhar ham donon ko saath rahanaa he to sirf mujhe hi kyun use bhi meraa khyaal rakhana chahie
 If ever i am allowed to come late due to work then why not me
 bachche paalane se lekar ghar chalaane kii sari jimmedaari mere hi sir kyon madhi ja rahi hai
 i think we got liberated but the thinking of society still could not get out of the fetters
 ''aazaadee khayalon main nahin jajbon main he jaruri, tabhi to ho sakegi desh kii har kami puri
 
 
 We have become independent from the British, now freedom from small thinking is also necessary

 pakistan ke nae pradhanmantri raja parvej ashraf ne 23 june ko pad kii shapath lee hi thi ki un par ekadam se bijli aa giri
 The Supreme Court on 27 June gave him a fortnight's time to write a letter to the Swiss authorities to reopen the long-dormant corruption cases against President Asif Ali Zardari
 aisa karne main asafal rahane par pichley pradhanmantri yusuf raja gilaani ko supreme court ne barkhaast kar diya tha
 The Supreme Court has also issued notice to Ashraf in the electricity rent scam in March 2011, the matter during his tenure as Energy Minister
 jab unhone nijee rental power plant (arpeepi) se bijli kii kharid ko manjuuri pradaan kii thi
 One immediate result of the scam is that Ashraf cannot leave the country and go out

 The list is sent to all immigration points to prevent those involved from leaving the country

 They produced only 120 MW of electricity

 Ashraf's party colleagues believe that his policies as the Energy Minister have actually pushed the country towards a power cut crisis
 supreme court ne hayaat or asif dwaara lagaae gaye aaropon par 15 disambar, 2011 ko swatah sangyaan liya tha
 In March 2011, a spate of allegations that the power plants failed to produce enough electricity enabled the Supreme Court to cancel the deal and launch an investigation against Ashraf

 The good news is that Indian brands live between the world of customers and the people of the country, not the world of politicians
 ve vyavsaayik hiton kaa dhyaan rakhte hue, jan-samskruti (popular culture) kaa dohan karte hue logon se samvaad karte hai
 They still see mass culture far beyond the radical nationalist influences of today's politics
 prayek swatantraaa diwas or ganatantr diwas par kai brand vishesh abhiyaan chalaate hai
 This shows what the business class is thinking about the state of the nation
 hamane abhi tak nahin dekha he ki swatantraaa diwas 2019 ke liye brand-spike kya hoga, par haalia rujhaanon ke aadhaar par kaha ja saktaa he ki kai brand na to deshbhakti par maujuuda siyaasi bahason ko aage badhaane kii koshish karenge, na hi unke khilaaf bahes karenge
 Patriotic politics was very worrying in the recent elections, it has also been dragged into the post-election political discourse
 bhaajapa ne khud ko dabang or adhinayakawadi deshbhakti ke pakshdhar ke rup main pesh karte hue sainya or raksha balon kii chhaviyon kaa istemaal kiya
 It called those who asked questions and those who expressed disagreement 'anti-national', what not
 iske pratirodh main kisi anya dal ne raajnneeti main deshbhakti kaa koi vaikalpik dhaancha nahin pesh kiya, sivaay un logon ke, jo siyaasi abhiyaanon main sainya chhaviyon ke upyog par vaad-vivaad karte rahe or seemaa paar aatanki shiviron par hui 'sargical strike' main hataahaton kii aadhikarik ghoshnaaon par sawaal uthaate rahe
 The media brands also quickly took a stand on the patriotism of those who received titles like 'piece-gang', 'khan market gang' and 'JNU gang' in election campaigns
 shukr he ki is bhayaavah maahaul main gaiyr-media brand is akhaade se dur rahe
 No commercial brand can survive in this new era of customer power, liberalization and women empowerment by becoming authoritarian
 par kya un brandon ko koi laabh nahin miltaa jo saamaajik-rajnatik muddon par nishchit rukh apanaate hai? adhik viksit bazaaron main haal ke shodh se pataa chalata he ki graahak un brandon ko pasand karte hai jo apni manyataon ko saarvajanik rup se saajha karte hai
 There is a brand in India that stands against this form of patriotism? Among the established brands that took a clear stand against the new politics of patriotism, it was one of the four big business groups in the country
 pichley saal swatantraaa diwas par isane trek driveron kii najaron se puure desh ko dekhne kaa pradarshan karne vaala ek abhiyaan chalaaya
 After talking about the different places, sounds and food items on his trip, one of them says, "my country is completely different from what they show on television sitting at home
" '' yah vigyaapan trek driveron ke vividhtapurna drushtikon kaa jashn manaata he or suzav detaa he ki ham unke sochane ke tareeke kaa anukaran karen
 Change happens slowly in India, until the point of overturning the prevailing political thought is reached
 haal main, ek khaadya saamagree vitaran seva ne hindu delivery boy bhejne ke graahak ke anurodh kii saarvajanik rup se ninda kii thi
 a cab service did the same
 shaayad yah sab sahasrabdi ke yuvaaon or jed peedi ke brandon ko yah kehane kaa saahas de ki ''ham is tarah kii baat se asahmat hai or ise asweekaar karte hai
 "how do Indian brands express patriotism, and how have they changed?" Many brands chose a safe, popular and clear way of praising the achievements of the country, remembering the past and recent achievements and honoring the great scientists
 ek sadabahaar vishaywastu jiskaa upyog kai brand ne desh ke saath apni pahchaan or prem ke pradarshan ke liye kiya he, vah he bharat kii vividhta kaa jashn manaanaa
 Until recently, it was also the official political philosophy that could best be seen in the government-sponsored Doordarshan's heart-touching film Mile Sur Mera Tumhara (1988) which featured the country's best singers
 1991 ke baad jab samaaj-nirmaan se dhyaan hataa kar rashtriya arthvyavastha ke nirmaan par kendrit kiya gaya, tab se sarkaar kii ore se aise abhiyaan nahin chale
 The expression of respect for the armed forces through 'jai Jawan' is another popular topic which is still prevalent and is perhaps the only area where political and brand narrative are the same
 1991 ke baad agle do dashakon tak bharat taqatvar hota gaya or 'raashtra nirmaan' pasandida vishay ban gaya
 Electrical brands, food brands, bank brands, business groups and big companies all competed to discuss their contribution to nation building

 Leaders of every segment of the market tried to describe themselves as synonymous with India and to contribute to raising the flame of India's diversity - 'taste of India', 'banker of every Indian', 'history of our nation History is 'and the most popular advertisement is' Buland Bharat's elevated picture
 'companiyon or sanchaarkon main peedigat badlaav ke saath yuva bharat aisi chizon ke bare main kaise sochataa he? kya ham deshbhakti ke prati unke ravaiye, bhartiya naagarik ke rup main bhoomika yaa swatantraaa diwas or ganatantr diwas par vigyapanon ke tareeke main unke brand kii bhoomika main badlaav dekh rahe hai? in brandon kaa ek bada hissaa desh ke in vishesh dinon ko sirf marketing avasar ke rup main dekhtaa he
 a hotel room aggregator inspires people to travel to different parts of the country by taking advantage of the long Independence Day weekend; There is another class that declares mega sales on these occasions, another class uses in the literal sense of freedom — such as the promise of 'freedom from cut and peel and rough beard' and freedom from worrying about slipping tires etc

 But there is no doubt that its possibilities are visible
