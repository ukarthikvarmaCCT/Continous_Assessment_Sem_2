 'badal said,' We have every right to interfere in the Delhi Gurdwara case because we fight elections there
 yah spasht he ki prastaavit sanshodhan par unki manshaa sahi nahin he
 "he said," The Delhi government's proposal to amend the Gurdwara Act made by Parliament is a direct attack on the religious rights of Sikhs

 Therefore, the Delhi government is deliberately doing this to delay the gurdwara elections

 Bollywood actress Koyna Mitra has been sentenced to 6 months in jail by a Metropolitan Magistrate's Court in a check bounce case
 itnaa hi nahin court ne ye bhi aadesh diya ki koena, shikayatakarta ko byaaj samet 4
 Also give 64 lakh rupees
 ye maamla maamla 2013 kaa he
 Poonam Sethi had filed a check bounce case against Koyna Mitra
 sethi kaa kahana tha ki koyna ne apni jarurat bataakar unase 22 lakh rupee udhaar liye the
 To give the same amount back, Koyna gave Poonam a check of three lakh rupees, which bounced
 check bouns hone ke baad punam sethi ne maamla darj karaayaa
 However, Koyna misrepresented the charge leveled against her and said that Sethi did not have the ability to lend
 sethi ne unke checks chura liye the
 During the hearing, the magistrate refused to accept Koyna's first argument and found on the second argument that Koyna could not prove that Sethi had stolen his checks
 court ne kaha ki koyna ne khud ko mili notice ke jawaab main ye baat nahin bataai or naa hi unhone iske bare main aage ection liya
 The court said, 'the check did not bounce on the fact that the lender had not given it, it bounced to the point that the money was not in the account
 agar ye maan bhi liya jaae ki shikayatakarta ne aaropee ke check, jo ki blank the, ko uske ghar se chura liya tha or unka galat istemaal kiya
 Even then, the accused had full opportunity to stop this payment
 lekin unhone aisa kuch bhi nahin kiya
 'koyna told Mumbai Mirror on this matter, "this case is totally false and i am being framed
 court main mere vakil maujuud nahin the, isliye meri baat ko bina sune hi faisla suna diya gaya
 We will challenge the Judgment of the court, my lawyers are working on it

 6th session of Manthan Aaj Tak 2017 'demonetisation - Kya Khoya kya kya?' Arundhati Bhattacharya, former chairperson of State Bank of India attended
 is satr kaa sanchaalan rajdeep saradesai ne kiya
 At the beginning of this session, Rajdeep asked Arundhati whether the government had approached you before deciding demonetisation
 Arundhati said that she too came to know only after the Prime Minister's announcement that the demonetisation decision has been taken
 vahiin nirnay sahi tha yaa galat ke sawaal par arundhati ne kaha ki kisi bhi bade faisle kaa moolyankan karne ke liye or adhik samay kii jarurat he
 Arundhati counted 3 benefits of demonetisation
 Arundhati said that there are two-three results of demonetisation
 First, the registration of tax payers in the country has increased
 doosraa, desh main karency cirkulation 2016 ke pehle choti karency sirf 16 fisadi tha lekin notebandi ke baad yah badhkar 28 fisadi ho chukaa he
 This is a very big thing for the economy
 teesraa, desh main digitaliseshan kii raftaar tej ho gai he
 If after the demonetisation, 10 rupees were being spent through the card, then now 300 rupees are being spent
 yah bhi desh kii arthvyavastha ke liye badi baat he
 The first step taken by the tax evaders in the direction of paying tax, the Prime Minister while announcing the ban on demonetisation in the country, said that this will put an end to terrorism in the country and black money will be completely eliminated
 arundhati ne kaha ki notebandi ke baad tex peyar kii sankhya badhane se ek baat saaf he ki november 2016 ke pehle jo log tex nahin de rahe the unhone tex dene kii disha main pehla kadam badhaayaa
 However, Arundhati said that black money cannot be completely controlled by this move
 ab jarurat he ki notebandi kii prakriya main sarkaar ke paas jo jamaa or nikasi ke aankade mili uski jaanch kii jaani chahie
 Also read: Modi's plan for 2019, Dawood, riots or war like Kargil: demonetisation to white out Raj Thakrekaledhan? Arundhati said she cannot give any political response to demonetisation
 haalanki unhone daawa kiya ki jis str par desh main notebandi kii prakriya chalaai gai usamen desh ke bainkon ne bahut bada kaam kiya
 In this way, it was not easy to change the country's currency in a few days
 aam aadmi maanata he ki notebandi acha faisla?arundhati kaa daawa he ki desh main jo log tex kaa bhugtan karte hai unhen notebandi ek acha faisla laga
 They believe that why should someone in the country steal tax
 arundhati ne kaha ki puri prakriya ke dauraan hamaari shakhaon se gaanv-gaanv se khabar aa rahi tha
 According to these reports, the common man believed that it was necessary to stop the parallel economy in the country
 haalanki yah roak lagane ke alag-alag tareeke ho sakate
 Demonetisation was to be done with complete preparation
 Aurohndati said that if it had been better prepared before the decision of demonetisation, it would have been easy for banks
 arundhati ke mutabik unhen itani badi sankhya main deshbhar main cash kaa sanchaar karne main suraksha or technology samet kai dikkaton kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Why all the banks in the country became ill? Rajdeep asked if the central government's decision of capital infusion in banks is right
 vahiin aakhir kaise bainkon kii sthiti itani kharaab hoti gai ki aaj use bachaane ke liye sarkaar tex peyar kaa paisa de rahi he
 To this, Arundhati said that to promote business in the country, lending is necessary
 vahiin karj dene auki lene main apana risk shaamil rahata he
 Due to the mere risk, the bank cannot refuse to lend to anyone to grow the business
 vahiin jahaan bainkon ko lagata he ki koi kaarobaari sirf karj na adaa karne ke liye karj lenaa chaahati he to use karj nahin diya jaataa
 In the event of companies not repaying the loan, it comes for business reasons and banks have to bear the burden
 yahi nahin, ellen ne apane microwave avan main laga electromangnet nikaala, kuch bydaree leen, kuch tach sensor istemaal kiye, or is hathode main asli hathode vaali khaasiyat bhi paidaa kar di
 
 
 The only difference is that no one other than Thor can lift the real hammer, and none other than Ellen can pick up this fake hammer
 
 
 thor bhi nahin, jab tak ellen uski anguliyon ke nishaan is nakli hathode main lage fingerprint scinar main feed nahin kar detaa
 
 
 The comments iske baad ellen ne vahi kiya, jo 'thor kaa hathaudaa' haath main aa jane par aap yaa main karte
 
 
 So, Ellen also came on the road, and challenged people to try to raise her
 
 
 iske baad kya-kya hua, or logon kii pratikriya kisi rahi, yah sab aap khud hi is video main dekhie, jise utyub par Sufficiently Advanced dwaara aplod kiye jane ke baad se ek hi hafte main ek karod 15 lakh se zyaada log dekh chuke hai
 
 
 After this, Ellen did what you or i would do when the 'hammer of thor' came in hand
 
 
 so, ellen bhi sadak par aa gaya, or logon ko chunauti dene laga ki ve use uthaane kii koshish karen
 
 
 What happened after this, and how was the reaction of the people, see all this in this video itself, which has been seen by more than 15 million people in a single week since uploaded by Sufficiently Advanced on youtube
 
 
 
 pani ke bina jivan kii naav majdhaar main funs kar rah jaati he
 Something similar is happening in Bihar these days
 navada jile ke viciit ke sudhir yadav har roj 20 litre doodh kii bikri karte the, jisase unhen 600 ru
 Used to earn income and the stove of their 17-member family burned
 jhulasa dene vaali garmi main sudhir ke ghar ke chuulhe kii aanch bhi maddhim pad gai he
 The reason for this is to sell the four buffaloes, which are the source of income due to the drinking water crisis in the village
 is samasya se nipatane ke liye sudhir ne 20,000 ru
 After spending 175 feet of boring, but success could not be realized
 nateeja, ab sudhir ke teen bhaaiyon ko mazdooree ke liye pardes janaa padaa he
 Not only this, they have to bring water from a well located at a distance of about one km to quench their thirst, where there are long queues
 sudhir bataate hai, ''gaanv main doodh se zyada pani kii keemat he
 The people of the village can take milk among themselves, but no water
 '' sudhir akele shaks nahin hai, jo aise halaat main fanse hue hai
 Baleshwar Mahato of Visiyyat of Meskaur block in Nawada district of Bihar was also paid Rs 1,200 a day for lack of water
 kaa nuksaan ho rahaa he
 Baleshwar used to sell 40 liters of milk daily, but for two months this earnings have fallen
 unke teen bete rojgaar kii talash main ghar se dur chale gaye hai
 Mithilesh Chakraborty, a villager, says, "there were about 250 liters of milk sold daily from the village
 lekin pani kii kami ke kaaran yah kaarobaar thap-sa ho gaya he
 The horrors of water scarcity can also be gauged from the fact that Kailash Mahato's house was set on fire a few days ago, due to lack of water, the villagers remained silent spectators and the house burned to ashes
 darasal, yah halaat bhu-jal main teji se giravat se bane hai
 Most of the village water sources, wells and hand pumps have dried up
 viciit akwla gaanv nahin he, jahaan pani ke liye haahaakaar machaa he
 There are more than two dozen villages in Meskaur block where there is a serious water problem
 mescor block headquarter bhi pani kii samasya se achoota nahin he
 The Meskaur Police has to bring water from a km away
 vaise to thane main paanch handpump hai, lekin bhu-jal str main giravat se sabhi bekaar ho gaye hai
 According to police officer Jaganarayan Ram, "the situation is bad
 pani kii kami ne behaal kar rakhaa he
 "the villagers of Kouakol do not sell livestock
" akasar aisi samasya se jujh rahe gramin garmi shuru hote hi baadh, barahia, bakhtiyarpur, mokama, or nepal ke tarai ke ilaakon main chale jate hai or barish hone ke baad lautate hai
 Vishwas Vishwakarma of Kouakol says that about 20,000 animals migrate from this area every year, adding Khaira in Jamui district, this number will reach 30,000
 pareshaani yaheen khatm nahin hoti
 There is a village Dudhpaniya
 gramin maanate hai ki yahaan pani kaa rang doodh jaisaa tha, jiske chalate gaanv kaa naam dudhpaniya he
 But now the dirty water of the well is also getting difficult
 naradiganj ke adampur main barsaat ke dinon main bhi log nadi kaa pani pine ko majaboor hai
 Although 4,000 wells were excavated by Loknayak Jayaprakash Narayan during a nationwide famine in 1966–67, now their existence has not survived

 The Bihar government has instructed to repair closed hand pumps and install new hand pumps to give relief from water problem
 piechaidi mantri chandramohan raay bataate hai, ''peyajal samasya se nipatane ke liye prayek block main oversier ke netritv main team banaai gai he
 Tankers have been provided with water for poor conditions
 '' samasya yaheen khatm nahin hoti
 Now the development and rescue of ground water is a big challenge
 central ground water board mid-eastern rijan kii aktubar 2010 kii report ke mutabik, do dashak main bhu-jal kaa str saadhe saat foot neeche gira he
 Rai says that the agency of Hyderabad has been authorized to study the situation of ground water level, based on its report, it would be easy to take steps in this direction
 philhal, bhu-jal ke richarge ke liye rajya ke 19 jilon kii paanch-paanch panchayaton main rain water harvesting kaa kaam shuru kiya gaya he
 However, 17 percent of the national average is in Bihar
 rashtriya maanak ke mutabik, gramin kshetron main prati vyakti prati din kam-se-kam 40 litre pani kii uplabdhta ke liye 250 logon par peyajal panit sthapit kiya janaa he
 But even more trouble is arising due to rapid downward movement of ground water
 chintaa kii baat yah he ki abhi pani ke abhaav main maweshiyon kii bikri or palaayan shuru hua he
 If this apathy persists, then the day is not far when humans will also flee on a large scale for water

 If the government goes ahead with the removal of 35A, then their point will be proved as predictable

 Why would anyone want to come to the state if they cannot buy a house here, their children cannot enroll in government colleges and they cannot do government jobs? The constitutional structure of the state hurt the people here, but it satisfied the separatist mindset of some people

 Since the Samajwadi Party (SP) came to power in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections, senior party leader Azam Khan is in constant discussion about his attitude
 sarkaar ho yaa party, unke bebaak bayaan or akramak tevar unhen vivaadon main laa hi dete hai
 After being removed from the post of minister in-charge of Meerut, Azam, who is in trouble with both the government and the party by offering resignation from the post of minister to Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, has an old connection with controversies
 kaha jaataa he ki sapa ke sansthaapak sadasyon main se ek ajam ko apni mukhaalafat katai manjuur nahin he

 donon ke bich vivaad ko shant karne ke liye mulaayam ko aage aana padaa tha

 mayawati ne kaha he ki bijepi isi saal chunaav karaane ke mood main najar aa rahi he
 He said that the manner in which Prime Minister Narendra Modi is raising the issue of hindu-muslim, cremation-graveyard and triple talaq by holding Smoghar Sabha meetings in Uttar Pradesh, it is a call to hold elections ahead of time
 iske alaava unhone aagaamee monsoon satr kaa bhi zikr kiya
 Mayawati said that the Narendra Modi government will face a no-confidence motion in this session
 mayawati ne press relies jari kar yah bhi kaha ki phek news, jatvaad or sampradayikta ko sarkaar kaa sangrakshan mil rahaa he
 Let me tell you that recently, the Law Commission had sought the opinion of all political parties on the proposal to hold elections simultaneously in the country
 vidhi ayog is baat kii sambhaavnaaen talash rahaa he ki kaise desh main ek saath loksabhaa or vidhansabha ke chunaav karaae jaaen
 However, even big parties like Congress and BJP have not sent their opinion to the Law Commission
 jabaki kuch vipakshi dalon kaa kahana he ki yah tarika sahi nahin he
 At the same time, the Samajwadi Party, the second main party of UP, is in favor of simultaneous elections and the party's leader Ram Gopal Yadav has already said to hold elections simultaneously in 2019

 The same Neera Yadav who accidentally paid tribute to Kalam a week before his death

 For a long time, Neera could not believe this news
 mangalvaar ko ranchi main divangatkalam ko shradhanjalidete hue nira fafakkar ro padin
 On 20 July, he attended a school in Hazaribagh district with Drs
 kalam kii photo par maala chadha di thi
 The photo went viral on social media and the education minister had to face criticism and criticism because of it
 unhone baad main safai bhi di thi
 In fact, on the 20th, Neera Yadav arrived as chief guest in a program organized at Saraswati Vidya Mandir School in Hazaribagh district of Jharkhand
 vahaan unhen smart class kaa udghaatan karnaa tha
 As soon as the program started, he wreathed a picture of former President Abdul Kalam, placed on the stage, planted tilak and then inaugurated the smart class by bursting coconut

 bina kisi sanshodhan ke is vidheyak ko modi sarkaar ke liye loksabhaa kii tarah rajyasabha main paas karana aasaan nahin he
 The BJP does not have a majority in the Rajya Sabha, so the support of allies as well as opposition parties will have to be won
 iske baad hi kahin jaakar is vidheyak ko kanoonee amalijama pahanaaya ja sakegaa
 Modi government ministers and BJP leaders are in talks with opposition parties to agree on a triple talaq bill
 modi sarkaar sheetakaaleen satr main hi is bill ko rajyasabha se paarit karana chaahati he, jo tedi kheer se kam nahin he
 In the Rajya Sabha, the BJP does not have enough strength to pass three anti-divorce laws on its own
 aise main bijepi ke liye is vidheyak par apane sahyogi dalon ke saath-saath vipakshi dalon par bhi nirbhar rahanaa padegaa
 While the RJD to the BJD are opposed to this bill, the Shiv Sena, including the Congress, wants some amendments
 congress,sapa makapa jaise dalon ne loksabhaamein vidheyak kii jaldbaaji par sawaal khadey karte hue sansadeey samiti ko bhejne kii vakaalat kii he
 In such a situation, all these parties can repeat the demand of sending them to the Parliamentary Committee for further discussion on the Bill in the Upper House
 rajyasabha main vipaksh ke paas paryaapt sankhya bal or bahumat he
 That is why it is believed that the opposition may come together to pressurize the amendment and send it to the Parliamentary Committee to make it difficult for the government
 rajyasabha main kiske paas kitni takat245 sadasyeey rajyasabha main nirdaleey or manonith sadasyon ko chhodkar 28 raajnneetik partiyaan hai, jinke sadsy hai

 iske alaava 8 manonith or 6 nirdaleey sadsy hai
 Currently, bjp-led NDA has 88 members in the Rajya Sabha
 inamen bijepi ke 57 sadsy bhi shaamil hai
 Even if the Modi government gets the support of all its allies, the support of at least 35 more mps will be needed to get the bill passed
 haalanki shivasena is vidheyak ko lekar sabhi kii raay nahin lene par etraj jataayaa he
 Despite this, the Lok Sabha has voted in favor of this bill
 kai logon ko chehre par ubhar aane vaala massa khubasurat najar aata he to kaiyon ko ye khubsuurati main daag

 Then apply toner on face and throat with the help of cotton
 iske baad aap jo bhi mechap karenge usamen massa najar nahin aayega
 2
 mechap karne ke dauraan aisa foundation lagaaein jo oil free ho
 When choosing a foundation, choose only a lighter foundation than your skin color

 So that they will not be seen
 3
 You can also use a concealer if you want

 He is a father figure & no one can approve of such a treatment to a father figure
 What you & your people have done with me, is still tolerable
 I'm able & capable of answering your people back in the same coin
 Remember Newton's third law

 According to sources associated with the Indian Air Force, taking care of the existing fleet of old Jaguars is getting heavier
 bhartiya vayusena ke ek varisht adhikari ne hairaani jataai ki ‘vayusena kyon aise or vimaanon ko lene kii icchhuk hogi?’phir rafel deal ke saath muft jaguaar die jane kii afvaah sabase pehle kahaan se udi? fact check team ne ek french saptahik patrika ko trek kiya jisane france sarkaar ke sutron ke hawaale se ek saal pehle ke daawey kaa zikr kiya ki france bharat ko 31 jaguaar ladaaku vimaan dene kaa iraadaa rakhata he
 It is true that India wants to change the squads of its fighters
 bhartiya vayusena ko 42 daston kii aavashyaktaa he lekin abhi iske paas ladaaku vimaanon ke 31 daste hi bache hai
 According to highly placed sources, France's first Rafale multirole fighter aircraft will be able to come to India only by 2019, so the Indian Air Force is in urgent need of spare parts
 bhartiya vayusena ke sutron ne fact check team ko bataaya ki hindustan aironautics limited (HAL) kii ore se kareeb 61 jaguaar vimaanon ko nausena or vayusena ke liye apgrade kiya janaa he
 Likewise, the original spare parts are not available for the three squads of the Mirage-2000 fighter aircraft
 france ne apane jaguaar vimaanon ko 2005 main hi ritair kar diya tha
 These were replaced by Dassault Rafale multiroleduke aircraft
 britain, ecuador, nigeria or oman jaise desh bhi jaguaar vimaanon ko hataa chuke hai
 Sources in the Ministry of Defense told India Today that France has agreed to provide spare parts from its retired Jaguar fighter jets
 ek aadhikarik sutara ke mutabik in spair parts ko bharat laayaa jayega or iske liye hamen sirf flite se laane kaa kharch dena hoga
 It is clear from the fact check team that India is not getting Jaguar fighter jets from France
 jo mil rahaa he wo sirf jaguaar ke spair parts hai jo hamaare maujuuda jaguaar vimaanon ko udaan ke liye sakasham rakh paaenge
 Also, these spare parts have nothing to do with the Rafale deal
 laal kile kii pracheer se pradhanmantri narendra modi ne somvaar ko apane bhaashan main pakistan ke baluchistan kaa bhi zikr kiya
 But Congress leader and former foreign minister Salman Khurshid targeted PM Modi speaking on Balochistan
 is mudde par aaj tak ne khurshid se khaas baat kii
 Excerpts from this conversation
 
 
 congress party ke netaa or upie sarkaar main mantri raherajeev shuklane aaj tak se baatcheet main kaha he ki baluchistan par pradhanmantri ne jo bayaan diya he vah nayaa nahin he
 This was the line of the Narasimha Rao government of the Congress, which he has repeated
 is par aap kya kahenge?khurshid:main us vakt videsh rajya mantri tha
 There has never been this line
 baluchistanko lekar agar koi aisa kah rahaa he to vah galat bayani kar rahaa he jhooth bol rahaa he is se main sahamat nahin hum
 What do you, as the former foreign minister, have to say on what the Prime Minister said on Balochistan? Khurshid: The Prime Minister has made completely wrong statements
 kisi bhi desh ke maamle main bolnaa bharat kii videsh niti kabhi nahin rahi
 What the Prime Minister has said, it could cause trouble for India in the coming times
 yah kisi videsh niti he ki kabhi aap pakistan ke pradhanmantri ko shapath grahan samaaroh main bulaate hai, kabhi aap achaanak navaj sharif se milane pahunch jate hai or kabhi ladaai jhagada mol lete hai
 India's stand on Baluchistan has always been that we do not interfere in the affairs of any other country, at least from the ramparts of the Red Fort
 aise main pradhanmantri ne jo kiya, vah aane vaale vakt main dikkatein paidaa karegaa
 But what did you do to separate Bangladesh? Khurshid: It was a separate issue
 lakhon sharnaarthi bharat aa gaye the
 Supporting the Bangladesh Mukti Vahini was the need of the hour
 usko is se nahin jodna chahie
 If there is a violation of human rights, then we talk on that matter, but what the Prime Minister said from the ramparts of the Red Fort is harmful
 iskaa khamiyaja bharat ko aane vaale vakt main uthaanaa pad saktaa he
 How do you see foreign policy? Khurshid: This foreign policy flop of the Modi government is the foreign policy that i have told you
 lekin yah koi gulli danda kaa khel nahin he ki aapane danda se goli maari, kisi ko lag gai or aapane sori kah diya or phir baat aage badha di
 Now what do you see in terms of foreign policy next? Khurshid: i think the Prime Minister should take a fresh look at this matter
 ab vah maafee maang lenge yaa niti main badlaav karenge
 He will have to see how to do it, but damage control will have to be done otherwise the case of India will become weak worldwide
 saleem ko ab dhang se yaad bhi nahin he ki ve kitne saal pehle apane gaanv kosi kalam se chalakar dilli aae the
 All they know is that taking care of Karbala Jorbag is their life
 yahaan log kam hi aate hai, yahaan bhuule-bhatke aane vaale log jo thodaa-bahut paisa de dete hai, usee se is 62 varshiya garib musalmaan kaa pet palata he
 He does not even have a dream that the waqf property market price of Rs

 On Sunday, people gathered at the Ramabai Ambedkar Maidan in Lucknow saw the huge image of Atal Bihari Vajpayee on the BJP platform
 narendra modi jis vakt raily ko sambodhit kar rahe the, prishthbhumi main atal bihari vaajapeyi kaa vishalkay photo unhen dekh rahaa tha
 Narendra Modi repeatedly recalled Atal Bihari Vajpayee in his speech and said that he had learned a lot from Vajpayee
 vaajapeyi ke hi andaaz main modi ne apane bhaashan main sher bhi sunaae or samaapan ek kavita sunaakar kiya
 The BJP decided to put only Atal Bihari Vajpayee's photo on the stage in Lucknow's Modi rally
 lakhanu loksabhaa seat vaajapeyi 1991 se 2004 tak lagaataar jitate aae
 Representing this seat, he became Prime Minister thrice
 unheen kii aguwai main bijepi ne uttar pradesh main loksabhaa chunaavon main sabase zyada siten jeetin
 By keeping Vajpayee's face ahead, the BJP won the support of the upper castes, especially Brahmins in the state
 tab kalyaan singh ke rup main party ke paas pichhadi jatiyon kii numaaindgi karne vaala behad majboot netaa bhi tha
 He addressed his last rally in Lucknow on 25 April 2007 before the assembly elections
 jisamen unhone phir ye doharaaya tha ki dilli kaa rasta lakhanu se hokar jaataa he
 Modi and BJP remember this lesson of Vajpayee
 isiilie party ne puraa jor uttar pradesh par lagaaya he
 However, the names of the candidates have not been announced yet
 lekin ye tay he ki bijepi tikat bantwaare main soshal ejineering kaa khaas dhyaan rakhegi
 The challenge before the party is to mobilize the support of upper castes and backward castes
 rajya main brahmanon ko phir apni ore kheenchna bhi ek bada lakshya nirdhaarit kiya gaya he
 Significantly, Bahujan Samaj Party has so far announced the names of 22 Brahmin candidates for the Lok Sabha elections
 uski ranneeti ek baar phir dalit, muslim or brahman gathjod kii he
 By adopting the same strategy in the 2007 assembly elections, the BSP won a historic victory
 isliye bijepi ko atal bihari vaajapeyi yaad aae hai
 The rally in Lucknow was Modi's eighth rally in the state
 isse pehle kisi raily ke manch par akele vaajapeyi kaa photo nahin lagaaya gaya tha or na hi itani shiddat se unhen yaad kiya gaya tha
 Since Vajpayee's withdrawal from active politics, BJP especially feels a lack of him in Uttar Pradesh
 pichley kai chunaavon main bijepi baar-baar savarnon ko apane saath laane kii koshish kar rahi he magar use isamen kamyaabi nahin mili he
 The vote percentage of the party in the state is continuously decreasing
 pichhadi jatiyon main uskaa samarthan simatata chalaa gaya
 BJP is making serious efforts this time to handle this downfall
 party ne narendra modi ko aage kiya he
 It hopes that the image of Modi's Hindutva and development and coming from the backward classes will benefit in Uttar Pradesh
 party kii koshish he ki modi uttar pradesh se hi chunaav bhi laden taaki unki lokapriyata kaa phayda mil sake
 There is a possibility that Modi may contest from Banaras
 kalyaan singh bijepi main waapas aa gaye hai
 The party is also trying to align with some small parties that do politics of one or more backward castes so that non-yadav backward castes can join them
 haalanki bijepi ke liye chunauti behad kathin he
 Liberal leaders like Atal Bihari Vajpayee who also tried to take Muslims along and this was also a big reason for winning from a seat like Lucknow continuously
 unki jagah aaj modi jaise netaa hai jinaki chhavi kattar netaa kii he
 In the communally sensitive state of Uttar Pradesh, by raising this image of Modi, the Samajwadi Party, Bahujan Samaj Party and Congress are trying to take all three Muslims with them
 rajya main sampradayik taur par dhruvikaran karne kaa prayaas sabhi partiyon dwaara kiya ja rahaa he
 Due to more than a hundred riots during the two-year tenure of the Samajwadi Party government, the atmosphere is also extremely angry
 lekin kya bijepi ke liye sirf vaajapeyi kaa photo lagaana yaa unka naam lenaa bhar hi kaaphi he? yaa unki di gai raajnneetik sikh ko jameen par lagu karnaa bhi? The BJP will have to increase its vote percentage by at least two and a half times to repeat the successes of 1996 and 1998 in the state
 iske liye khaali naaron se hi kaam nahin ho saktaa or na hi kisi ek nuskhe se
 This is the biggest challenge of Narendra Modi

 43 cr congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi kaa mangalvaar ko karnataka ke party diggajon ke saath din bhar manthan chalaa
 The most important issue was that who would get a place from the party in the cabinet in Karnataka
 america se lautne ke baad mangalvaar ko rahul gandhi kaa puraa din karnataka main cabinet kii paheli ko sulajhane main beetaa
 The leaders with whom Rahul Gandhi had previously spoken separately included DK Shivakumar, who was the head of the campaign committee in Karnataka elections, MP k h Muniyappa, Karnataka Congress working president Dinesh Gundu Rao and former state agriculture minister Krishna v Gowda
 iske baad rahul gandhi ne karnataka ke liye party prabharee ke si venugopal, purv mukhyamantrisiddharmaiyaor karnataka ke upmukhyamantri or party ke pradesh adhyaksh ji parameshwara ke saath mantranaa kii
 Rahul Gandhi's discussions with party leaders from Karnataka besides the cabinet also discussed how to keep the party's alliance with JDS in the state united for two years
 do saal hi kyon? jab ye sawaal karnataka se party ke ek netaa se poocha gaya to unka kahana tha, 'agar ham do saal tak saath rah sakate hai to ham 5 saal ke puure kaarykaal main bhi saath rah sakate hai
 BJP will definitely try to mess up (like destabilizing the government), so we want to make sure that the coalition government runs smoothly without any hiccups
 'rahul gandhi ne karnataka ke party netaaon se haalia vidhansabha chunaav main congress ke pradarshan ko lekar feedback bhi liya
 Rahul Gandhi wanted to know the reasons why the party did not succeed in retaining power of the state on its own
 mantranaa main ye mudda bhi shaamil rahaa ki kis tarah 2019 loksabhaa chunaav ke liye karnataka main sanghathan ko taiyaar kiya jaae
 a senior party leader from Karnataka said, "until now, Siddaramaiah used to be the surveyor of the Congress in Karnataka, but now we have the responsibility to strengthen the organization in view of the general elections next year along with running the government
 'aisi sambhaavna jataai ja rahi he ki buudhvaar dopaher ko karnataka main cabinet mantriyon ko shapath dilaai ja sakati he
 Who will be made a minister from the Congress, it is soon announced by the All India Congress Committee (AICC)

 This is the word that you must have heard during the debate on TV in the last few days, you must have read it in the headline of some news in newspaper
 pichley kuch dinon main jis tarah se karnataka main sarkaar gathan ko lekar siyaasi uthapatak machi he, is shabd kaa upyog bad gaya he
 But what does it mean and what does it have to do with politics? yahaan samajhie
 
 
 After all, what does this mean? 
 
 ?darasal, horse trading kaa matlab 'ghodon kii bikri' se he
 The term originally originated from the Cambridge Dictionary
 kareeb 18veen shatabdi main is shabd kaa istemaal ghodon kii bikri ke dauraan vyapaaree karne lage, lekin iske saath kisse jude ki iske raajnneetik myne bhi nikaale jane lage
 The early 18th century, around the 1820s, when horse traders used to buy horses of a good breed, and the techniques used for some sort of juggling or finesse to get something good was called horse trading
 bataaya jaataa he ki is dauraan vyapaaree apane ghodon kii kahin par chupa dete the, kahin par baandh dete the yaa phir kisi or astabal main pahunchaa dete the
 Then the deal was done on the basis of its cunning, money transaction
 ek kissa ye bhi
 
 
 Also in the olden times, when the traders of India used to send their karinds to the Arab country to buy horses
 to waapas aate vakt kuch ghode mar jate the, lekin apane maalikon ko santusht karne ke liye wo ghodon kii poonch dikhaakar hi ginati puri kar liya karte the
 That is, if you bought 100 horses, then 90 showed the remaining 10 and showed that they were dead
 maalik yakeen kar lete the
 So later Karinds started taking 100K money and bought only 90 horses
 matlab 10 ghodon kaa phayda uthaanaa shuru kar diya
 It has also been linked to stories of horse trading
 raajnneeti main horse trading kya he
 
 
 ? Although there is no justification for the term in politics, but its usage has increased in the recent past
 jab raajnneeti main netaa dal badalte hai, yaa phir kisi chaalaaki ke kaaran kuch aisa khel rachaa jaataa he ki duusari party ke netaa aapkaa samarthan kar den tab raajnneeti main ise horse trading kaha jaataa he
 In India, it is also called dal-badal, dal-badlu
 isko lekar apane desh main kanoon bhi he
 What does the Anti Defection Law (anti-defection Law) say? # The second paragraph of the Schedule explains the basis for disqualification under the Anti Defection Law
 # yadi koi vidhayak swechha se party kii sadsyta tyaag de # agar vah party dwaara jari kiye gaye nirdesh ke khilaaf jaakar vot kare yaa phir voting se dur rahe
 # Independent candidates will be disqualified if they join any political party # One party can be merged with another party but for this at least two-thirds of the mlas of the party need votes
 karnataka-goa-manipur-uttarakhand main lage aaropahaal hi ke dinon main jis prakaar goa, manipur, uttarakhand or karnataka main raajnneetik uthal-puthal machi to horse trading ke hi aarope lage
 The Congress party alleged that BJP is buying and selling mlas, besides threatening many mlas
 iske alaava rajyasabha chunaav ke dauraan cross voting ko lekar bhi kai tarah ke aarope lagaae gaye the
 There has been an uproar in the congress-bjp on the praise of Atal Raj
 vitt mantri pi chidambaram ne kaha he ki narendra modi aankadon ke saath farji encounter naa karen
 At the same time, he has described UPA One as the golden period of development
 iske jawaab main bijepi netaa yashavanth sinha kaa kahana he ki agar modi phenku hai to pi chidambaram superphenku
 In fact, this war of words started after Narendra Modi's address on Sunday
 modi ne apane bhaashan main daawa kiya ki jab endie satta se baahar gai to us vakt vikaas dar 8
 4 per cent and NDA was the golden period of development
 iske jawaab main pi chidambaram ne somvaar ko press vijyapti jari karke modi ke daavon ko jhootha bataaya
 After the attack on Modi, senior party leader and finance minister Yashwant Sinha appeared in the NDA government
 unhone modi ke daavon ko sahi bataaya or chidambaram par tathyon ke saath aatankwaad karne kaa aarope lagaaya he
 Yashwant Sinha said, Chidambaram ji is playing with essential facts and has accused Modi that he is having a fake encounter
 mere hisaab se chidambaram aankadon ke saath aatankwaad kar rahe hai
 Targeting the Finance Minister, he said, 'chidambaram ji has been the Finance Minister even before, between 1996-98
 jab unhone mantralay choda tha to us vakt desh kii vikaas dar thi 4
 8 percent
 pehle saal main yah 7
 6 percent and fell to 4
 8 fisadi ho gai
 Even today, the growth rate 4
 8 fisadi he
 In the previous term too, Chidambaram had done the work of bringing down the growth rate and is still doing the same today
 unhen sabase pehle iskaa jawaab dena hoga
 'he said,' Chidambaram is trying to play with the figures
 ausat ke aadhaar par kah rahe hai ki hamane bahut badhiya kaam kiya par aaj kya sthiti he
 When the growth rate 8
 6 fisadi thi tab hamane satta chodi
 Today the same rate is 4
 8 fisadi
 Why not compare it
 isliye maine kaha he ki wo aankadon se aatankwaad kar rahe hai
 Describing the NDA government as better in terms of employment and inflation, he said, "they are only talking about growth rate
" rojgaar kii baat kyon nahin kii
 We employed a total of 6 crore people for five years
 inhone sirf 27 lakh logon ko naukari di he
 Why is Chidambaram silent on inflation hamaare samay main kya sthiti thi or aaj kya he
 Everyone knows this

 The State Department's comment on the statement of the US institution was the same as the record of USCIRF: MEA had demanded a ban on Amit Shah after the passage of the Citizenship Amendment Bill in Lok Sabha
 a statement has been issued regarding Minister Amit Shah, in which he has demanded a ban on him
 is masale par ab bharat ke videsh mantralay ne jawaab diya he or kaha he ki is santhaan kaa jo trek record rahaa he, usase vah chaunke nahin hai
 Still, he condemns this statement
 videsh mantralay kii ore se kaha gaya ki USCIRF kii ore se jis tarah kaa bayaan diya gaya he, vah hairaan nahin karata he kyonki unka record hi aisa he
 However, it is also reprehensible that the organization has given such a statement even after having little knowledge of the land
 videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa raveesh kumaar ne mangalvaar ko is masale par bayaan diya
 Ravish Kumar said, 'the statement made by USCIRF is not correct nor was it needed
 ye bill un dharmik alpsankhyakon ko bharat kii naagarikta detaa he jo pehle se hi bharat main aae hue hai
 India has taken this decision in view of human rights
 is prakaar ke faisle kaa swaagat kiya janaa chahie, naa ki uskaa virodh karnaa chahie
 " # meaon @ uscirfstand on # CAB" The position articulated by USCIRF is not surprising given its past record
 It is, however, regrettable that the body has chosen to be guided only by its prejudices and biases on a matter on which it clearly has little knowledge & no locus standi"pic

 The suggestions made by the institution in its statement are not true in any way

 USCIRF is deeply troubled by the passage of the Citizenship (amendment) Bill (CAB) in the Lok Sabha
 The CAB enshrines a pathway to citizenship for immigrants that specifically excludes Muslims, setting a legal criterion for citizenship based on religion

 There is a new bloom in the politics of Maharashtra and its fragrance is starting to come
 mumbai main guuruuvaar ko ajtak ke kaarykram mumbai manthan main bijepi kii swaabhaavik sahyogi party maane jane vaali shivasena ke netaa sanjay raut or maharashtra navnirmaan sena ke pramukh raaj thakare (manase) ne khulkar iskaa izhaar kiya he
 While Raut praised the leadership of Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi, Raj Thackeray said that those who called Rahul Gandhi as Pappu are scared of him
 mumbai manthan kebijapi banaam shivasenaseshan main raut ne kaha ki gujarat main rahul gandhi ko sunne ke liye baari bheed umad rahi he
 The public can make anyone Pappu, Rahul Gandhi is no longer Pappu
 rahul gandhi kya bolta he, kya karata he
 Whom do you get? usamen is desh kii janata ruchi lene lagi he
 This means that Rahul Gandhi can also give leadership to this country
 raut ke saath hi maharashtra navnirmaan sena ke netaa raaj thakare ne bhi rahul gandhi kii tarif kii or kaha ki jis vyakti ko bijepi pappu-pappu kahati rahi, aaj wo gujarat main jhappu ban gaya he
 As many people are coming to his rally
 usase darkar pradhanmantri aath-aath baar nau-nau baar gujarat ja rahe hai
 Thackeray said that you kept insulting Rahul Gandhi for so many years and now the same man is going to Gujarat, so why are you scared
 usee aadmi ke peeche hajaaron-lakhon log khadaa ho rahe hai, to dar kyon lag rahaa he
 Why are so many chief ministers of BJP going? haal ke varshon main yah pehali baar tha jab ek saarvajanik manch se shivasena or raaj thakare ne congress upaadhyaksh kii khulkar itani tarif kii he

 In Mumbai Manthan, Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis praised NCP chief Sharad Pawar and said that Pawar saheb never stood against development
 jaahir fadanvis kaa nishaanaa shivasena or uddhav thakare the
 The Shiv Sena has been consistently opposing the policies of the state government
 ek tarah se kaha jaae to bijepi ke saath satta main rahete hue shivasena rajya main vipaksh kii bhi bhoomika nibhaa rahi he
 Whether it is the issue of farmers or the floods in Mumbai, the Shiv Sena does not condone targeting the BJP and the Fadnavis government
 'sarkaar ke 3 saal' seshan main devendra fadanvis ne ensipi ke saath gathbandhan par to kuch nahin kaha, lekin unhone uddhav thakare ko salaah de daali kii wo jo kar rahe hai, us par vichaar karnaa chahie kyonki janata ko yah pasand nahin aayega
 BJP CM had a clear message that Uddhav Thackeray is not liking what he is opposing BJP
 288 siton vaali maharashtra vidhansabha main bijepi ke paas 122 siten or shivasena ke paas 63 siten hai
 On the other hand, Congress has 42 seats and NCP has 41 seats
 mumbai manthan main congress netaa prithviraj chavaan ne congress or ensipi ke saath milakar chunaav ladane kaa aahvaan kiya tha
 The previous government in Maharashtra was NCP and Congress
 aise main shivasena kaa congress kii tarif karnaa maharashtra kii siyaasi bisaat par uddhav thakare kii chaalon kaa sanket detaa he
 Taking a dig at Sanjay Raut's statement at the same event, BJP leader Vinod Tawde said that he had made such a prediction in the UP elections as well
 is par raut ne kaha ki upi chunaav main wo galat sabit hui, lekin yahi gathbandhan is desh kii raajnneeti main aage badhegaa

 On the strength of bjp's breach of opposition, the NDA is also seeking a majority in the Upper House, the Rajya Sabha
 rajyasabha main bahumat hasil karne par bijepi ko apane agenda ko dharaatal par utaarne main aasaani hogi
 The BJP will also be able to pass major bills from the Rajya Sabha which were not passed during the previous government
 vaise 2020 tak khaali ho rahi siton ke chalate bijepi kaa rajyasabha main vipaksh ke mukaable majboot hona tay he
 But before that BJP is trying to strengthen its position due to house arrest in opposition
 vipaksh kii sendhamari kii baat karen to andhra pradesh main telugu desham party ke kul chah main se chaar sadsy bijepi main shaamil ho chuke hai
 The membership of these members has also not come down due to the number being two-thirds
 inelo ke bhi ek saansad bijepi kaa hissaa ban chuke hai
 Samajwadi Party leader Neeraj Shekhar has resigned from the Rajya Sabha after joining the BJP
 isse rajyasabha main vipaksh kaa ek saansad kam ho gaya
 It is being said that BJP is in touch with about four Rajya Sabha members of SP and BSP
 isamen se do saansadon se bijepi kii baat kaaphi aage bad chuki he
 If we look at the number strength in Rajya Sabha, in the very first session of the second term of the Modi government, the ruling NDA is getting very close to the majority in the Rajya Sabha
 245 sadasyeey sadan main philhal 5 pad khaali chal rahe hai
 121 mps are needed for a majority in the House
 is samay NDA or nirdaleey or manonith sadasyon ko mila kar bijepi kheme main 116 saansad hai
 In this way, if four more SP and BSP mps resign, then the majority figure will be 119
 vahiin upachunaav kii sthiti main upi kii rajyasabha siten bijepi ke khate main jaaengi
 The Rajya Sabha has a total of 245 seats in the Rajya Sabha
 5 siten khaali hai
 Thus, the number of mps of major parties in the 240-member Rajya Sabha is as follows
 bijepi ke paas 78congress ke paas 48ediemke 13eitisi 13samaajawaadee party 12bijd 7jadyu , tiares 6-6sipiai(em), rajd 5-5bispi, ensipi 4-4aam aadmi party, shiromani akali dal, shivasena 3-3ye bill paas karaane main milegi madadmodi sarkaar ke agenda main sabase upar teen talaak kaa bill he
 Despite passing the Lok Sabha in the previous government, this bill could not be passed in the Rajya Sabha
 vajah ki rajyasabha main endie ke paas bahumat nahin tha
 Apart from this, citizenship amendment bill, land acquisition bill, amendment in labor law, passing of DNA regulation bill from Rajya Sabha will help to give citizenship to Hindus coming from neighboring countries

 They may have to wait longer to get a flat
 asal main maujuuda aarthik halaat main difalter company amrapali kii gaiyr awasaiya property ke kharidaar nahin mil rahe kyonki bank in property ke liye lone dene ko taiyaar nahin dikh rahe
 Attempts by the Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT) in Delhi to sell Amrapali's properties for the fourth time have not been successful, as banks are not willing to give loans for these properties
 amrapali kii awasaiya pariyojnaon ko puraa karne ke liye kareeb 8,000 karod rupee kii jarurat he, jisamen se 4,000 karod rupee kharidaaron dwaara die jane hai or baaki raashi diarti ko amrapali kii kai properties bechakar jutani he
 Construction work on various Amrapali sites has been stopped since 2015
 supreme court ne amrapali ke residential projects ko puraa karaane kii jimmedaari neshnal buildings construction corporation (NBCC) ko saunpi he
 On behalf of the buyers of the house in Amrapali's project, senior advocate Mihir Kumar said that the process of completion of the construction of the defaulter builder Amrapali's flats due to rising bad loans in banks, non-performing assets (NPA) and poor sentiment in the real estate market
 May be delayed
 supreme court ke saaf nirdesh ke baavjood, amrapali ke kharidaaron ke liye makaan kaa chaabi milanaa abhi sapana hi he, kyonki date recovery tribunel amrapali kii properties ko bechney main vifal rahaa he
 Kumar said, "even if the home buyer deposits the entire amount of his money, only 50 percent of the funds needed to complete the projects will be released
 diarti dwaara amrapali kii gaiyr awasaiya pariyojnaon ko bechney kaa prayaas baar-baar isliye vifal ho jaataa he, kyonki bank aise sambhavit kharidaaron ko lone nahin de rahe, jabaki unhen iske liye dhan 15 din ke bheetar cash dena hota he
 So even if a person has 100 crore rupees, then why would he buy Amrapali's project, while with the help of bank loan, he can buy another 10 such projects
 'amrapali ke karjon kii vasuuli main safalataa milane kii kisi sanket ko na dekhte hue ab homebayrs bhi flats ke lone ke liye baaki rakam dene se hichak rahe hai
 For the past decade, about 46,000 homebuyers have been waiting to get possession of their flats in various Amrapali projects
