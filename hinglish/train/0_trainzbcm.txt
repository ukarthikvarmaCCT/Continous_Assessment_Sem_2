 In Uttar Pradesh, the trumpet of the assembly elections can be blown any day, but the Samajwadi Party, which holds the power of this largest state of the country, is still battling arrogance within itself
 ek taraf mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav pradesh kii takreeban sabhi siton par apane pasandida ummidavaaron kaa chayan kar isaki vistrut suchi rashtriya adhyaksh mulaayam singh ko saunp chuke hai to duusari ore party ke pradeshdhyaksh ne bhi 175 ummidavaar final kar apni suchi mulaayam ko saunpi he
 Needless to say that both these lists have recommended giving tickets to their trusted leaders
 ab khabar ai he ki akhilesh yadav kii is list main shaamil takreeban aadhe netaa to tikat na milane par nirdaleey ummidavaar ke rup main chunaav maidan main utarane ke liye taiyaar hai
 However, political experts are telling this more than the pressure medicines of Akhilesh and there are reasons for this
 -chunavi raajnneeti kii samaj rakhane vaale jaanate hai ki bina kisi party ke saport ke apane dam par chunaav jeetna naammumkin nahin, to mushkil jarur rahaa he
 If we look at the election history of UP, then mostly such independents will be found who either won because of their muscle power or their popularity was very high in the area but there have been few such cases
 -nirdaleey ummidavaar bhale hi kisi party ke tikat par na khadey hon lekin ve sabase zyada nuksaan usee party ko pahunchaate hai jinase unka judaav rahaa he
 Because from worker to vote bank both are same
 aise main nirdaleey ummidavaaron ke maidan main utarane se nuksaan to samaajawaadee party kaa hi hoga jo sidhe-sidhe akhilesh kaa nuksaan banegaa
 -if Akhilesh Yadav also makes his pro-choice candidates independent, how will he go to ask for votes for them? Will he raise the Samajwadi Party flag in the same seat and ask for a vote against the authorized candidate who is contesting the election with a bicycle symbol? But he cannot forget that a remote voter in the state knows him only as the Chief Minister of SP
 aise voter akhilesh ko dobaaraa siem banane ke liye sapa ko hi vot denge or iviem main cycle ke saamne kaa hi batan dabaaenge bhale hi pratyaashee unki bajaay, unke chachaa shivpal ke kheme kaa ho
 For a while, even assuming that Akhilesh fielded 200 independents and a large number of them win the election, what is the guarantee that they will remain with Akhilesh even after the victory
 upi kaa raajnneetik itihaas aise udaahranon se bharaa padaa he jinamein nirdaleeyon ne apni jeet ke puri keemat sattadhari party se vasuuli he or vakt-vakt par paala badla he

 Cricinfo quoted a BCCI official as saying that the Dileep Trophy was held at an interval of one and a half years, not annual

 The official said that this tournament will be played with pink ball only
 lekin iskaa aayojan satr kii shuruyaat main hota, to hi behatar hota, na ki madhya main yaa ant main
 The official told the website, 'if you remember, we had not organized the Duleep Trophy even before the 2016 T20 World Cup, because when we are going to select the T20 team, then this tournament has any significance
 Does not happen
 'unhone kaha, 'pichley saal hamane 13 test maichon kaa satr khelaa tha, isliye dilip trophy se shuruyaat karnaa acha tha
 The tournament ends in 24 days
 aise main aane vaale lambey satr or sabhi maidaanon ke vyast rahane ke kaaran ham ise june yaa july main nahin kara sake, hamaare paas sirf sitambar kaa maheenaa bachaa tha
 "this year we are starting with the international series, which will start on September 17," the official said
 isi kaaran timen 10-11 tak ekatrit ho jaaengi
 That is why we decided not to hold it in this session and postponed it to the next session, which would be the Test session where India would play with the West Indies, Australia and New Zealand

 While doing some research on Subhash Chandra Bose, one of the greatest architects of India's independence, i have known that the Ford Motor Company gave its new V-8 car for free to the use of Congress ministers during the Haripura session of 1938
 Since then, this honor has completely changed into amazement

 During a search for confirmation of Ford's imaginative seduction at Leonard Gordon's Brothers Against the Raj on Subhash Chandra Bose, i came to know that Bose was actually taken to a congressional camp town on a chariot donated by a local respected person Gaya was engaged in '51 strong bulls
 un dinon congress kaa vishisht vaahan kisaanon kii baiylgaadee hi thi, ise 1952 ke baad congress kaa chunaav chinh bhi banaaya janaa tha
 But this symbolism, including the strong bulls, was secured for the final round

 Elder Henry Ford or his executives knew only in 1938 that even the majestic British Raj could not foresee that power was moving from one base to another and that the era of empire was surrendering to egalitarian nationalism

 In the long run, no power could prevent India from gaining independence, but if Hitler had not exhausted Britain, the freedom struggle for India could have been a violent and prolonged process
 itihaas kii sabase mahaan vidambnaaon main se ek baat yah he ki 1945 kii haar se germany to ubar gaya, lekin british samrajya jeet ke baad bhi kabhi ubar nahin paaya
 There was also some irony in the fact that the fiery reformist and fighter Bose in his presidential address to Haripura hurt capitalism: "great Britain has an unbreakable relationship between the capitalist ruling class and the colonies located abroad
" '' nishchit rup se bose ne yah nahin sochaa hoga ki america poonjivadiyon ko bakhsha ja saktaa he
 In another fascinating indirect comment, Bose stated that they would not allow Japanese multinationals to operate in independent India, while they were at the time moving to liberate their homeland with Japanese troops

 unhone kaha ki yadi police hinsa rokane ke liye koi kadam nahin uthaati, to hamaari najar main vah apni duty thik se nahin kar rahi
 The Union Home Minister Shah said that there is stone pelting from inside the Jamia Millia, people come out and vandalize

 Vehicles are set on fire
 police tab bhi kuch na kare to meri najar main police apni duty thik se nahin kar rahi

 dilli ke siem arvind kejariwal or bollywood abhinayta saf ali khan kirashi singhhai
 Now let us see how many qualities and shortcomings are there in Kissin Rashike
 
 
 singh raashike jaatakon main hoti hai ye khubiyaan
 
 
 1
 swabhimani hote hai or apane atmasamman kii keemat par inhen kuch bhi manjuur nahin hota
 Arvind Kejriwalbat When the family is there, Arvind Kejrimwal's self-respect may be seen, but in his short political career, his self-esteem has been transformed into pride
 saf ali khansingh raashike jaatakon main swabhimaan or atmasamman kuta-kuta kar bharaa hota he
 However, he gave an example of how self-respecting Saif Ali Khan is in Taj restaurant in 2012, where he killed a South African business man
 2
 Are honest
 arvind kejarivalbhrashtachar ke khilaaf or eemaandaaree kii khatir hi arvind kejariwal ne raajnneetik kariyar shuru kii
 However, his opponents and leaders who have separated from his own party have accused him of corruption many times
 saf ali khansef apane kaam ke maamle main pakke hai
 But many girls came and went in his love life
 amrutha singh se pyaar or phir shaadi ke baad unhone karina se shaadi kii
 Meanwhile, many girls entered his life
 3
 You give up everything on whom you love
 arvind kejarivashravind kejariwal kaa apane parivaar se pyaar jaahir he, lekin dilli or desh kii khatir unhone jis pyaar kaa izhaar kiya, use virodhiyon ne kai baar jhootha sabit kiya he
 Even as Saif Ali Khan Jahan talks about sacrificing love, Saif has recently made a sacrifice for his brother-in-law Ranbir Kapoor, Kareena Kapoor's brother
 darasal, ranbir kapur kii 'jagga jasoos' or saf ali khan kii film 'shef' kii rilijing date aasapaas hi thi
 That's why Saif Ali shifted his film date till October for Ranbir's sake
 haalanki isse zyada balidaan sunne main nahin aayaa
 4
 madad karne ke liye hameshaa taiyaar rahete hai
 Arvind Kejriwal As soon as he started his political career, Arvind Kejriwal promised to help the people against corruption
 par unke viraadhiyon kii maane to aaj kejariwal janata kii madad karnaa bhul gaye hai or bhrashtachar main lipt ho gaye hai
 Even detractors say that friends who helped in starting a romantic career have left behind
 saf ali khansef ali khan ke dosti ke kisse to kai milte hai
 But they have not helped anyone, it is not heard
 haalanki priti jinta ne ek baar saf kii jaan bachaai thi, tab se saf ne kai baar priti jinta kii madad jarur kii he
 5
 inaki ichhashakti evam aatmavishvaas bahut prabal hota he, jisase ve kam yogyata hone par bhi ucch padon par asin ho jate hai
 For Arvind Kejriwal, Arvind Kejriwal this is a matter of great interest
 unke aatmavishvaas kaa hi nateeja he ki wo aaj dilli ke siem hai
 Saif Ali Khan In the early Bollywood era, Saif was no more than a comedy actor
 par jaldi hi unhone kam mehnat main hi film ke super star kettgari main apni pahchaan bana lee
 Leo also has these drawbacks
 
 
 1
 The voice is loud and loud
 arvind kejarivalbhrashtachar ke khilaaf aawaaj uthaane vaale arvind kejariwal jab bhi apane virodhiyon ke khilaaf munh kholte hai, kuch kadava hi bolte hai
 Especially when he speaks for the Prime Minister of the country, Narendra Modi, his voice can be felt
 saf ali khanbollywood ke is chocolati hero ko unki mithi boli ke liye ladkiyaan behad pasand karti hai
 However, on the issue of brother-nephew, Ajan etc
, Saif has reacted sharply to the twitter many times
 2
 These people are arrogant
 arvind kejarivaldharna pradarshan se raajnneetik kariyar shuru karne vaale kejariwal par virdohi aksar unke ahamkaari hone kaa iljaam lagaate rahete hai
 Saif Ali Khan However, in Bollywood, Saif is called cool dude
 par saf ali khan ke ahankaar ek namoona tab dekhne ko mila jab ek vyapaaree ne unhen or unke doston ko khaane kii teble par shor na machaane ke liye kaha
 Saif in turn punched him
 2
 The tendency to rule is innate
 arvind kejarivalshuruaati daur main arvind kejariwal ko dekhakar aap yah andaja nahin jagaa sakate the ki yah saadhaaran sa dikhne vaala aadmi desh kii rajdhani dilli kii kaman haath main lene vaala he
 But what happened later proves that the tendency of governance is inherent in them
 saf ali khanpataudi parivaar kii athaah sampatti ke vaaris saf ali khan main bhi ye gun dekha ja saktaa he
 He is the heir of the princely state of Pataudi
 3
 They do not tolerate any opposition
 arvind kejarivalhalanki kisi bhi vyaktin ko apana virodh pasand nahin hota, par arvind kejariwal ke sandarbh ye baat isliye sateek he, kyonki wo isse jaldi hi prakriya bhi de dete hai
 If the opponents are to be believed, then those who oppose Kejriwal inside the party do not like them and they have to see the way out
 saf ali khansef vaise shant or jolly mood main hi rahete hai
 But sometimes his bitter attitude is also seen in front of the opponents
 twit ke jariye unhone kai baar apane virodhiyon ko kadaa jawaab diya he

 AIADMK party kaa simbel dobaaraa dilwane ke liye 60 karod rupee main shashikala ke bhattije dinakaran se deal karne kaa aaropee sukesh chandrashekhar dilli police kii giraft main he
 Sukesh and his girlfriend Leena Maria have cheated several hundred crores
 apane mahange shauk ko puraa karne ke liye ye donon natvarlaal ban gaye
 People licked millions of crores
 dilkash lekin chalbaaj is heroin kii sammohan takat ne uske astabal main duniya kii sabase khubasurat or mahangi kaaron kaa puraa kafila khadaa kar diya tha
 Just think, when sitting in cars of one to four crores, when she starts to defraud the world, then who would not have trapped herself in the trap of her eye and beauty? Yes, Tollywood means Bollywood from South movies In view of the story of Leena Maria, the heroine who is going to kill the entry, the police herself is not ready to give her a lesser title than Lady Natwarlal
 27 may 2013 ko dilli or chennai police ke joint oparation ke tahat giraftaar kii gai leena or uske bwyfriend par kai iljaam hai
 In the last one year itself, many people across the country have lost several hundred crores
 inamen kuch rashtriya bank tak shaamil hai
 She used to do all this work with her lover, who was already in the business of cheating
 donon laal batti yaa mahangi kaaron main bijnesaman se lekar sarkari bank ke afasaron se milte
 During this time, Maria would be used as a baby doll
 bwoyfriend deal karata or garlfriend apni dilkash adaaon se unako anjaam tak le jane main madad karti
 After completing her studies from Dubai in 2011, Maria arrived in Mumbai to try her luck in the modeling world
 vahaan uski mulaakaat sukesh chandrashekhar se hui
 Moving around in expensive vehicles, wearing clothes and five-star living quickly brought the two closer
 is bich donon main pyaar ho gaya
 Sukesh then got Maria some modeling assignments and then took her to Chennai
 chennai main maaria ko sukesh kii madad se kai filmon main heroin kaa lead role mila or wo dakhte hi dekhte tollywood main mashhoor ho gai
 Later, Maria finds out that Sukesh's entire earnings are fraudulent
 farrotedaar angreji bolne vaala sukesh khud ko iees afasar bataa kar nae-nae project paas karaane ko lekar bijnesaman se paise letaa yaa phir bank se lone
 After that, he would slip the money as soon as he got his hands
 is kaam ke liye usne maaria ko apana partner bana liya
 It is said that in Chennai, Sukesh and Maria together defrauded hundreds of crores of people
 in donon ke karname sabase zyada surkhiyon main tab aae jab sukesh ne maaria kii madad se chennai ke canara bank se 19 karod 75 lakh ke lone liye or phir rakam milte hi gaayab ho gaye
 Sukesh had described himself as an IAS in the bank

 To escape, both of them came to Delhi and started living in a farm house

 When the police went to apprehend them, it was found that she had gone shopping
 police vahaan bhi pahunch gai
 Leena was recognized but could not recognize her lover and he escaped
 chaar lakh rupee maheene kiraye par liye is form house main donon liv in relationships main rah rahe the
 Even though the Indian Space Agency ISRO (ISRO) suffered a setback in the Chandrayaan-2 mission, it had lost contact with Vikram Lander
 lekin, isro vaigyanik ab bhi vikram se sampark karne kii koshish kar rahe hai
 Now, along with ISRO, the US space agency NASA is also helping ISRO
 lekin, is bich isro ke spes aplicoshan centre ahmedabad ke purv nideshak or iaiti khadgpur ke edjunct professor tapan mishra ne bataaya ki is mishan ke bigadane ke teen bade kaaran kya ho sakate hai
 Professor Tapan Mishra explained in a phased manner on his social media account how the landing must have gone wrong and where attention was needed
 2
 isro's contact with Vikram was broken at 335 meters, not 1 KM, this graph is proof
 
 
 ab jaanate hai ki pro
 What are the three big reasons Tapan Mishra gave 1
 thrusters sahi samay par ekasaath na start hue honvikram lander chand kii sataha se 30 kimi kii oonchai par 1
 Was traveling at a speed of 66 km per second
 jab use chand kii sataha par utaarna tha tab vikram lander ko sidhaa rahanaa tha or uski gati 2 meter prati second honi chahie thi
 Vikram Lander has five big thrusters
 jo use landing main madad karte
 With the help of these thrusters, Vikram Lander also made rounds of the moon
 inke alaava vikram lander par 8 chote thrusters or hai
 Thrusters are like small rockets that help propel an object forward or backward
 1 saal ke liye gaya tha chandrayan-2 kaa orbitor, jaaniye kaise 7 saal tak karata rahegaa kampanch bade thrusters vikram ke neeche lage the
 Four thrusters in four corners and one in the middle
 ye vikram ko upar-neeche le jane main madad karte
 Whereas, 8 small thrusters would help in Vikram's direction
 ye ho saktaa he ki chand kii sataha se 400 meter kii oonchai par landing ke samay sabhi bade thrusters main ekasaath eendhan na pahunchaa ho
 This would have made sure that all the thrusters were not started simultaneously
 nateeja ye ki lander teji se ghoomane laga hoga or santulan kho diya hoga
 At this time the lander must have been rotating like Chakri fireworks in Diwali
 2
 The engine has not reached the right time and the right amount of fuel, the major part of Vikram Lander is the fuel tank
 lander kii tej gati, braking kii vajah se eendhan apni tank main vaise hi uchhal rahaa hoga jaise pani ke tub main pani uchhalata he
 Due to this, fuel would not have reached the engine nozzle properly
 isaki vajah se landing ke samay thrusters ko puraa eendhan na milane se landing main gadabadi aa sakati he
 The speed of Vikram Lander in reaching a height of 400 meters from a height of 30 km 1
 66 kimi / second (6000 kimi / ghanta) or 60 meter / second (200 kimi / ghanta) ho gai thi
 The direction of the lander was also vertical from horizontal
 is puure samay konon par maujuud chaar thrusters kaam kar rahe the jabaki bich vaala thruster band tha
 Whether or not Vikram Lander was contacted, the 6 achievements were registered in the name of ISRO
 The direction of the lander became vertical at an altitude of 400 meters
 neeche ke chaar thrusters main se do band kar agal-bagal lage do chote thrusters ko on kiya gaya taaki neeche aane ke saath-saath vikram helicopter kii tarah mandara sake or landing ke liye sahi jagah khoj sake
 But nowhere did any thruster support Vikram
 aisa isliye hua hoga ki eendhan sahi tareeke se ekasaath sabhi kaam karne vaale thrusters tak na pahunchaa ho
 3
 chand kii gurutvkarshan shakti se lard na paaya ho vikramchand kii sataha se 100 meter kii oonchai par vikram lander helicopter kii tarah mandaraata
 Small thrusters on the side were on to tolerate the moon's gravitational force
 lander kaa camera landing vaali jagah khojataa or phir utarataa
 The picture taken with the camera would match the image stored in the onboard computer
 iske baad vikram lander mandaraana band kar dhire-dhire chaar bade thrusters ko band kar bich vaale paanchaven thruster kii madad se neeche utarataa
 At this time, the radar altimeter in the Vikram lander takes care of the height of the lander
 chunki landing puri tarah se automatic thi, isapar prithvi se control nahin kiya ja saktaa tha
 Here, gravity could not be detected by Vikram Lander, because there is a change in the effect of gravity there
 ye kaisaa inaam? Chandrayaan-2 se pehle sarkaar ne kaati ISRO vaigyanikon kii tankhwaah The people of the cross-line area of ghaziabad with a population of eight lakh have decided to boycott the upcoming Lok Sabha elections
 logon ne ye kadam ilaake ko mukhya shahar se jodne ke liye aarobi ke nirmaan kii apni maang kii andekhi ke chalate uthaaya he
 In this regard, people of the area have challenged all political parties by placing hoardings in the area
 agar aap gajiabad jaaen to vahaan railway stesan ke baahar lage hording ko jarur dekhen
 On that hoarding it is clearly written in big letters that if there is no railway over bridge at Dhobighat, no vote
 ilaake ke tamaam chauraahon-tirahon par lage aise hi hordings ke jariye logon ne saaf taur par chetavanee di he ki yadi loksabhaa chunaav se pehle is ilaake ko mukhya shahar se jodne vaala railway over brij na banaaya gaya to wo chunaav kaa bahishkaar kar denge
 In fact, the Ghaziabad railway station and its straight-line railway line support area is known as the line crossing area
 is ilaake main kareeb sattar choti-badi coloniyon ke saath-saath nagar nigam ke 14 ward bhi hai
 Despite this, the people of its area have only the support of the railway bridge to go to the city from here
 wo bhi sirf or sirf paidal
 The condition is that if someone's condition in this area worsens, then to take him to a large hospital, several kilometers N
 ech
 One has to walk towards the city at 24
 isi ke chalate pichley kai saal se ilaake ke log dhobighat par railway line ke upar aarobi banane kii maang kar rahe hai
 Due to no easy way to get to the city and from there, people often have to pass through railway lines, due to which people die due to the train's grip on the day
 logon kaa aarope he ki tamaam rajnatik dal chunaav ke dauraan to aarobi nirmaan kaa vaayada karke ilaake ke logon se vot or samarthan vasuul lete hai, magar is disha main kisi ne prayaas nahin kiya
 Leaders of all political parties and Lok Sabha candidates have been given an open warning by the people of this area with a population of eight lakh, but the leaders of any party are not ready to speak on this
 dekhnaa ye hoga ki rajnatik dal logon kii is maang kaa credit lene ke liye aarobi ko lekar koi pahal karte hai yaa phir is ilaake ke logon ko chunaav kaa bahishkaar karke apana virodh jataana padegaa
 New facts are coming out in the passport of hindu-muslim couple in Lucknow
 passport par bavaal ke baad ab tanvi seth ke asli pate kii jaanch kii ja rahi he
 The Passport Office has appealed to the Lucknow Police in this regard

 At the same time, according to Lucknow police sources, Tanvi Seth is originally from Gonda district

 Explain that the couple accused the passport officer of insulting them in the name of religion
 vivaad ke tool pakadaney ke baad aanan-fanan main tanvi seth kaa passport unhen de diya gaya tha
 Discussion of this matter has started once again due to the unfolding of new facts of the case in social media and the reasoning in the matter of Passport Officer Vikas Mishra
 passport adhikari vikaas mishra ne tanvi seth kii shaadi ke baad naam badal kar sadiya anas rakhe jane or badale naam ke kollam ko khaali chhod die jane par tanvi se sawaal puche the
 Also, while staying in Noida, he was questioned on giving the address of Lucknow
 tanvi sethne noida main rahete hue noida kaa pataa na dekar sirf lakhanu kaa pataa diya tha
 Also, no information about the changed name 'sadiya Anas' in the Nikahnama was written in the passport form
 ise lekar passport adhikari ne tanvi seth se sawaal jabaab kiye the
 Now Tanvi's address is being investigated again
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki agar unke adress main gadabadi pai jaati he, to tanvi kaa passport bhi jabt kiya ja saktaa he

 vahiin ise lekar ek pareshaani khadi ho gai he
 BCCI awarded Dravid 4 for a two-year contract to remain the coach of the home teams
 5 karod kaa bhugtan karne kaa faisla kiya he
 But still he will not be available for the Under 19 team's tour of England starting July 15
 darasal kaaran ye he ki dravid under-19 team ke saath saath bharat e team ke coach bhi hai or 15 july ke dauraan hi unhen bharat e team ke saath south africa daure par janaa padegaa
 This is the biggest reason for criticizing the bcci's decision to appoint Dravid as the coach of both the teams
 ek angreji akhbaar ne bisisiai adhikari ke hawaale se likhaa he ki, “is daure ke liye ham dravid kii jagah kisi or ko under-19 team kaa coach niyukt karenge
 "however, this will not completely solve the board's problems
 kyonki under-19 team ke gendbaaji coach paras maarambe or fielding coach abhaya sharma bhi sioe ke nae anubandh ke chalate hiton ke takaraav se jujh rahe hai
 To this, the BCCI official said, "before signing the contract with us, everyone has to resolve their issues of interest, and we will give a 12-month contract to everyone
 ” iskaa matabal ye he ki abhaya sharma ko himanchal pradesh team ke coach kaa pad chhodana padegaa or agar vah aisa nahin karte hai, to board ko under-19 team ke liye nayaa fielding coach dhundhna hoga
 The officer has also said in his statement to the newspaper that before the tour starts in England, he will announce the names of the entire coaching staff, including Physio, trainer and video analyst

 ji haa, kabhi congress or argedy ke tikat par chunaav ladane vaale jeethanram maanjhi ne apni party hindustani awam morcha ko bihar mahagathbandhan main shaamil karne kaa faisla kiya he
 Manjhi left the nda's alliance with the BJP to contest the Bihar Assembly 2015 election Hindustani Awam Morcha (HAM) president and former Bihar CM Jitan Ram Manjhirajag
 iske saath hi maanjhi ne tejasvi ke nyaute par argedy se raajnneetik gathbandhan kar liya he
 a seat which was found in Bihar elections, Jitu Ram Ram Manjhi was given Nitish's chair while in JDU and sometimes was taken away
 jediu se alag ho kar nai party HAM banaai or 2015 kaa chunaav ladane ke liye rajg main shaamil hue, lekin sirf ek hi seat jeet paae
 The grand alliance of RJD, JDU, Congress, SP, NCP got success in Bihar 2015 election
 nitish kumaar nesiem to lalu yadav ke bete tejasvi yadav ne dipti siem kaa pad sambhala
 However, this grand alliance broke out on July 2017 and JDU formed a government with the BJP
 jab siem pad nahin chhodana chaahate the maanjainithish sarkaar main essi or asti mantri rahe jeethanram maanjhi 20 may 2014 ko bihar ke mukhyamantri bane kyonki nitish kumaar ne 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main haar kii jimmedaari lete hue istipha de diya tha

 Has been a member of Congress and RJD for years, Manjhi was a member of Congress from 1990 and became MLA from 1980 to 1990 on Congress ticket
 iske baad maanjhi argedy main shaamil ho gaye or chunaav ladakar 1996 se 2005 vidhayak bane rahe
 In 2005, he joined JDU
 maanjhi ko jab farvari 2015 main siem pad se hataaya gaya, tab unhone apni nai party banane kaa elaan kiya

 In fact, some women tried to run away from the Asra Shelter Home in Patna on August 10, but failed
 iske baad usee raat shelter home kii do mahilaayein murda pai jaati hai
 Now after the suspicious death of two women, the police arrests the head and the owner
 tab saamne aata he siyasat ke galiyare main unke rusuukh kaa wo sach jisane bihar kii raajnneeti main phir bhuuchaal laa diya he
 Relationship with influential people: His smiling picture continues the search for the biggest fraud in Bihar
 uski sohabat ke mureedon kii khoj shuru hui to aise-aise chehre saamne aane lage ki logon kii jubaanen khuli kii khuli rah gayi
 In fact, the conduct of the Asra Shelter Home was the bridge of party hatred in the fierce politics of Dayal Behar
 argedy ke shyaam rajak uske liye palak paanvade bichhaae rahete the to mrityunjay tiwari ke saath bhi uskaa uthanaa baithna tha
 Former minister Shivcharan Das also used to stand in his reception
 bihar main manisha kaa jalawaabihar main jalawaa hua karata tha manisha dayaal kaa
 And how could it not? uske liye bade-bade mantri swaagat main dastarkhwaan sajaate the
 Honorable opposition was also behind his social service
 or ye silsilaa jari hi rahata agar patna ke aasraa home se do auraton kii laashen na nikalatin
 And this distinction does not open that an attempt has been made to forcibly hide their corpses

 After all that was not realized, let us see the condition of Shelter Homes in the district
 bataate hai ki mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ke khasmkhas afasar hua karte hai dm sahab
 Now when the cm's hand is on the forehead, why worry? aaraam se daftar jate, chaay-naashtaa khaanaa karte
 Used to gossip and sleep peacefully
 lekin is neend main shanivaar ko us vakt khalal pad gaya, jab aasraa shelter home kii do mahilaon kii sandigdh maut ho gai
 Asra Shelter Home tried to dispose of it and the distinction opened
 shelter home kii sanchalika he manishaasra shelter home ke malikan kii khoj shuru hui
 It is revealed that Manisha Dayal's maya is behind this
 aasraa home kii sachiv hua karti hai manisha dayaal
 And the owner is Chintaran Kumar
 naam main hi chintan or upar se chirantan
 Who spoils what
 raat-raatbhar aasraa homes se ladakiyon ke cheekhney chillane kii awaajen aatin thim
 She was trembling in horror
 lekin jubaan koi nahin kholta tha
 When the girls screamed, the entire locality would fall asleep
 lekin sarkaar main sunata koun
 Because from Nitish Kumar's party to Tejashwi Yadav, there were big leaders who were ready to serve Manisha Dayal
 to sawaal uthaane waalon or jawaab dene waalon ke bich jazbaat kaa pul hua karti thi manisha dayaal
 Appreciation of his benevolence stood up for him from the line
 bade bade netaa lagaate the linemaneesha dayaal kii jalawafaroshi kaa andaja isi se lagaaie dekhte hi dekhte manisha dayaal ne swayamsevi sansthaaon kii line laga di thi
 Apart from Anumaya Human Resource Foundation, which runs Aasra Home, she was engaged in social upliftment through at least 5 voluntary organizations
 ab police pataa laga rahi he ki aakhir manisha dayaal main aisi koun si naayaab khubi thi ki bade-bade netaa unke saamne aate hi haath jodakar khadey ho jate the
 Leader of Opposition in Madhya Pradesh Legislative Assembly Ajay Singh has alleged that the government is unstable due to the ongoing infighting in BJP in the state and Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan has no control over governance and administration

 If seen, the Chief Minister of Telangana
 chandrashekhar raav (kesiar) iti hub kahalaane vaale hyderabad main baithe hai, to unka uthaaya gaya yah kadam katai bhi anoothaa nahin lagegaa ki chunaavon ke dauraan kiye apane vaadon ko lekar vah vidhansabha main ek 3di powerpoint pressentation pesh kar rahe hai
 
 
 Now, even though the 62-year-old chief minister is trying to keep up with the new times, the opposition Congress on the other hand says it does not want to do so at all
 
 
 telugana vidhansabha kii 119 main se 21 siten jeetne vaali congress rajya kii sinchai pariyojnaon ko lekar taiyaar kii gai is pressentation main bhaag nahin le rahi he, kyonki unke mutabik yah 'vidhansabha kii maanya paramparaon ke khilaaf' he, or isse galat udhaaharan prastut hoga

 is kadam ko lekar unhen kaaphi aalochanaon kaa saamana bhi karnaa padaa tha, kyonki unke rajya ke kisaan karze or sookhe se jujh rahe hai, or jab se rajya kaa gathan hua he, 2,100 se bhi zyaada kisaan aatmahatya kar chuke hai
 The Congress, which won 21 of the 119 seats in the Telangana Legislative Assembly, is not participating in this presentation on the state's irrigation projects, which according to them is 'against the traditions of the Legislative Assembly', and would set a wrong precedent
 vidhansabha main teen sadasyon vaala anya vipakshi dal telugudesham party (tidipi) bhi pressentation kaa bahishkaar kar rahi he
 The Congress says that if KCR would give a presentation in this way, then the debates going on in the Vidhan Sabha in a good and traditional way will also get entangled in technical debate from the beginning in the future
 tippaniyan Significantly, after the formation of Telangana, the Congress had to face a tough defeat in the first election in 2014, while in undivided Andhra Pradesh, the Congress held power for many years

 The post mortem report of Karnataka cadre IAS officer Anurag Tiwari has arrived
 report ke anusaar, anuraag kii maut dam ghutane se hui he
 At the same time, many bruises have also been found on his face
 agrim jaanch ke liye visra surakshit rakhaa gaya he
 The investigation of this case has now been handed over to the CBI
 postmortem report ke mutabik, anuraag ke honton ke andar neeche kii ore or thudi ke paas chot ke nishaan mili hai
 The suspicious death of Anurag Tiwari is once again under question after the post mortem report came out
 anuraag ke parijanon ne kisi tarah kii gadabadi kii ashanka jataai he
 On Monday, Anurag's brother Mayank lodged an FIR against the unknown in Hazratganj Kotwali
 somvaar ko hi parijanon ne upi ke CM yogi adityanath se bhi mulaakaat kii thi
 CBI inquiry was ordered in the case after meeting CM Yogi
 upi kedijipi sulakhan sinhane is cese kii jaanch CBI dwaara karaae jane kii pushti kii
 a lot of questions are arising in the case of IAS officer Anurag Tiwari's death, which may have been taken by the cbi's help to resolve it
 cese se jude pramukh sawaal kuch is tarah se hai:anuraag ke hont ke neeche chot kaise lagi?jaankaron ke mutabik, esphiksia (asphyxia) jise saamaanya bhashaa main dam ghutana kehete hai, do hi halaat main ho saktaa hai, hatya yaa haadasa
 In the event of a natural death, it is unlikely
 visheshgyon kaa kahana he ki anuraag ke sharir par jo chotein hai, vah haadasa nahin balki kisi or disha main ishaara kar rahi hai
 If Anurag had fallen, there should have been more injuries on his body
 unke neeche vaale hont par andar kii ore chot thi
 In the event of a fall, there should have been injury both inside and outside the lip
 munh dabaane kii sthiti main aisi chot laganaa ek kaaran ho saktaa he
 Apart from this, the post-mortem report mentions two injuries on the chin, such an injury comes when the chin of a person hits the object
 sadak par thudi takaraane se duusari tarah kii chotein aati hai
 In such a situation, there should have been injuries to the face and head as well
 postmortem ke dauraan vahaan aane vaala shaks koun tha?media reports ke mutabik, anuraag ke bhai mayank kaa aarope he ki postmortem ke dauraan doctoron se milane ke liye ek shaks (sarnem khan tha) vahaan aayaa tha
 According to Mayank, the man was talking to a panel of doctors
 is dauraan uski kisi baat ko lekar doctoron se bahes bhi hui
 The family objected to that unknown person being present there
 jiske baad vah shaks vahaan se chalaa gaya
 According to the family members, the person had asked the post-mortem doctors to dispose of the postmortem as a formality and dispose it off quickly
 kahaan gaya IAS anuraag kaa yphone?anuraag ke bhai mayank ke mutabik, anuraag ke paas do mobile phone the
 iphone and Samsung S7
 anuraag ke parijanon ko maut ke duusare din uskaa samsung phone mila tha
 Nothing has been revealed about the iphone yet
 parijanon ke mutabik,yphone main gopneey datatha
 Anurag used to do all the banking work from his iphone
 anuraag ko 17 may ko lakhanu se bangaleru janaa tha
 He had his ticket canceled on the night of 16 May
 is par bhi rahasy barkaraar he
 Was Anurag murdered to stop the disclosure of the scam? Lucknow IG Amitabh Thakur (rules and Manual) has said that there is a big conspiracy behind the death of IAS Anurag Tiwari
 unhone kaha, anuraag tiwari khaadya vibhaag main ho rahe ek ghotaale ko ujagar karne vaale the, jisase unke varisht afasar naaraaz the
 Bhai Mayank says that the food supply involved the wife of a prominent Karnataka official
 ghotaale kaa khulaasa hone par adhikari kii patni bhi usamen funsane vaali thi
 If Mayank believes, this is why many administrative officials of Karnataka were pressurizing Anurag to retreat
 nirmaataaon ke mutabik, visheshgyon va karmiyon ne optical fibre ke daayre ko 20 kilometre tak badha diya he, taaki pul par puure network signal ko sunishchit kiya ja sake

 Jio extended ring time of outgoing call to 25 seconds
 Airtel and Vodafone Idea are adamant on keeping it at 30 seconds
 Reliance Jio, company of Reliance Group led by Mukesh Ambani, has increased the ring time of outgoing calls from its network from 20 to 25 seconds
 , But this does not lessen the resentment of other companies like Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea, because they have at least 30 seconds of ring time Has to stick on demand
 telecom companiyon kii chetavaneegauratlab he ki airtel ne haal main telecom regulatory athurity of india (TRAI) ko ek letters likhakar chetavanee di thi ki agar jeeyo kii ring time barkaraar rahi to duusari telecom companiyaan bhi outgowing kol ke liye ring samay ko ghataakar 20 second kar sakati hai
 Airtel had requested TRAI to ask Jio to extend ring time
 iconomic times ne ek sutara ke hawaale se khabar di he, 'reliance jeeyo ne apane outgowing kol ke liye ring time badhaakar 25 second kar diya he
 This is an interim move of sorts and the company is awaiting trai's guidelines in this regard
 ' TRAI ko likhe letters main airtel ne aarope lagaaya he ki jeeyo ring time ghataakar interconection ujes charge (IUC) main chhedchhad kar rahi he
 Airtel has said that the short time ring alert means that there will be more missed calls and in this way there will be more return phone calls in Jio's network
 airtel kaa kahana he ki isse jeeyo nirbhar company ko hone vaale aiusi bhugtan main katautee kar sakati he
 However, Jio has denied the allegations, saying that 15-20 seconds is a standard adopted worldwide
 is masale par tri kii 6 sitambar kii baithak main charchaa kii gai thi
 In this meeting, Airtel, Vodafone Idea, BSNL and MTNL supported the need to have at least 30 seconds of ring time for answering a call
 haalanki, jeeyo ne kaha tha ki ring time 25 second kaa hona chahie, jeeyo kaa daawa tha ki kisi kol vaale paksh ko jawaab dene ke liye 20 second kaaphi he or zyada samay rakhane kaa matlab spectrum sansaadhan kii barbaadi he
 a senior source of Jio told the newspaper that there has been no change in the attitude of Jio since the meeting on 6 September and the company has not received any instructions from the regulator about this
 tri ne is bare main ek kansaltesan paper jari kar suzav maange hai or telecom companiyon se kaha he ki ve is paper ko antim rup milane se pehle kisi aam sahmati tak pahunch jaaen
 On Friday, director Avinash Das's first film 'anarkali of Ara' is released
 is film kaa nirdesan or isaki kahani donon hi avinaash das ne hi likhi he
 In this film, Swara Bhaskar plays the main character of Anarkali
 swara ke alaava sanjay mishra, pankaj treepathi, ishtiya khan or vijay is film main ahm bhoomika nibhaa rahe hai
 In this film, Anarkali is a dancing and dancing girl from Ara and she makes a living by singing and dancing at the Rangeela Dance Party
 anaarakali apane ilaake main kaaphi jaani jaati hai or unke kadaradaanon kii list main saamaanya logon se lekar ilaake ke rasukhdaar log tak shaamil hai
 But for Anarkali, the difficulty arises when one of the major figures in the area becomes obsessed with beauty, not of Anarkali's skills
 ab iske baad anaarakali ke liye kya pareshaaniyaan khadi hoti hai or aakhir kya kahati he yah kahani yah dekhne aapako hi cinemagharon tak janaa hoga
 Before that, let me look at some of the shortcomings and strengths of this film
 khaamiyon kii bataa karen to mujhe lagata he kii film ke kirdaaron ko set karne main kaaphi vakt le liya gaya he
 Like in the beginning of the film, the song has to be played for a long time
 saath hi anaarakali kii shoharat, uske aas paas ke kirdaar or uske kadradaanon ke kirdaaron ko khadaa karne main kaaphi lanbaa samay liya gaya he jisase film kii shuruyaat dhimi pad jaati he
 Also the screenplay seems a bit scattered in the beginning
 is film kaa aadhaar bihar kaa banaaya gaya he isliye ho saktaa he ki kuch darshakon ko bhashaa yaa yahaan ke hasya bhav ko samajhane main thodi pareshaani aae
 The comments vahiin is film kii khoobiyon kii baat karen to isaki sabase badi takat he iskaa vishay, isaki kahani , isaki script or iske dialog
 Also, when all this happens on the backdrop of Bihar, then the temper of entertainment in it becomes stronger
 haalanki screenple main thodaa jhol he lekin film kaa sangeet or kalakaaron kaa abhinay aapako iskaa ahsaas hone nahin detaa
 Every actor of the film meets his test and his acting fills the scenes
 swara bhaskar kaa behtareen abhinay unase aapako nazren hataane nahin degaa, vahiin ishtiya khan apane har seen main baaji maar le jate hai
 Sanjay Mishra is an unmatched actor and he has once again proved that the film industry should look beyond comedy
 is film main jahaan ek sandesh he vahiin isamen kai seens main humor bhi he
 However, this film also gives the same message like 'pink' that 'no means no' and forcefully without will is wrong
 yah ek acchhee film he jise dekhnaa chahie
 My rating for this film is 3
 5 stars
 Tell me about the flaws, i think a lot of time has been taken to set the film's characters
 jaise film kii shuruyaat main kaaphi lambey samay tak gaanaa bajaanaa hota he
 Also, it has taken a long time for Anarkali's fame, the characters around her and the characters of her appreciation to take a long time to slow down
 saath hi shuruyaat main screenple thodaa bikharaa lagata he
 The basis of this film is made in Bihar, so it is possible that some viewers may have some difficulty in understanding the language or the humor here
 tippaniyan While talking about the merits of this film, its biggest strength is its subject, its story, its script and its dialogue
 saath hi jab ye sab bihar kii prishthbhumi par ghatit hota he to isamen manoranjan kaa tadakaa or majboot ho jaataa he
 Although the screenplay is a little shaky, but the music of the film and the acting of the actors do not let you realize it
 film kaa har actor apni kasuti par khara utarataa he or unka abhinay drishyon main dam bhar detaa he
 Swara Bhaskar's best acting will not let you lose sight of him, while Ishtiaq Khan takes the lead in every scene
 sanjay mishra bejod actor hai or unhone ek baar phir sabit kiya he ki film industry ko unhen kamedi se hat kar bhi dekhnaa chahie
 While the film has a message in it, it also has the humor in many scenes
 haalanki yah film bhi 'pink' kii tarah hi yahi sandesh detii he ki 'na kaa matlab na hota he' or bina marji ke jor jabardastee galat he
 This is a good film to watch
 is film ke liye meri reating he 3
 5 stars vahiin is film kii khoobiyon kii baat karen to isaki sabase badi takat he iskaa vishay, isaki kahani , isaki script or iske dialog
 Also, when all this happens on the backdrop of Bihar, then the temper of entertainment in it becomes stronger
 haalanki screenple main thodaa jhol he lekin film kaa sangeet or kalakaaron kaa abhinay aapako iskaa ahsaas hone nahin detaa

 During this time, the Chief Justice said that the NGT is taking new steps for the betterment of the people, so we all should cooperate in this work
 somvaar ko supreme court ne yachika ko khaarij karte hue kaha ki court NGT ke adeshon main dakhal nahin degaa
 The petition also sought stay on two orders of the NGT
 isamen 4 march 2015 ko 10 saal puraani deazal kii gadiyon ko hataane or sitambar 2014 main 15 saal puraani petrol gadiyon ko dilli kii sadakon se hataane ke aadesh jari kiye gaye the
 The petition said that the NGT cannot issue such orders as it is a matter of the Motor Vehicle Act and only the central government can make changes in it
 NGT main jo aadesh die hai wo uske adhikaar kshetra se baahar hai
 Along with that it was also said that this act is for the whole country, in such a situation, there cannot be a separate law for Delhi alone
 tippaniyan But the Supreme Court said that the NGT is giving the same order which the courts have given
 15 saal puraani gadiyon ko hataane ke aadesh sabase pehle andhra pradesh hai court ne die the, jin par supreme court ne muhar lagaai thi
 Now when the NGT is working for the betterment of the people, everyone should cooperate and not stall its work

 On Monday, the Supreme Court rejected the petition, saying that the court would not interfere with the ngt's orders
 yachika main NGT ke do adeshon par roak lagane kii maang bhi kii gai thi
 In this, orders were issued on March 4, 2015 to remove 10-year-old diesel vehicles and in September 2014 to remove 15-year-old petrol trains from Delhi's roads
 yachika main kaha gaya he ki NGT is tarah ke aadesh jari nahin kar saktaa, kyonki ye motor whical act kaa maamla he or isamen sirf kendra sarkaar hi badlaav kar sakati he
 The orders given in the NGT are outside its jurisdiction
 saath kii ye bhi kaha gaya ki ye act puure desh ke liye he aise main sirf dilli ke liye alag se kanoon nahin ho saktaa
 The comments lekin supreme court ne kaha ki NGT vahi aadesh de rahaa he jo adaalatein de chuki hai
 The order to remove 15 year old vehicles was first given by the Andhra Pradesh High Court, which was approved by the Supreme Court
 ab jab NGT logon kii bhalaai ke liye kaam kar rahaa he to sabko sahyog karnaa chahie na ki uske kaam main roda atkana chahie
 With this, the court dismissed this petition

 In March last year, Amit Shah was made the national general secretary of the BJP from the state leader
 9 july ko ve party ke adhyaksh bana die gaye
 Shah is the youngest leader to reach this position, just three months away from completing 50 years
 party sanghathan main unke is ubhaar main loksabhaa chunaavon main unki nigaraanee main uttar pradesh main party ko mili anokhi kamyaabi ahm seedhi bani
 The party contested 78 out of 80 seats in the state and won 71
 haalanki shah ke is bhagyoday ko kuch aise hi maamalon main samet dene se puri kahani nazarandaaj ho jaati he
 In this rise of Shah, the delicate balance between the RSS and Prime Minister Narendra Modi has its place on the bjp's affairs
 modi ne jaise mantralayon kaa aavanton kiya or pichley aath hafton main kiye gaye unke nitigat faislon se jaahir he ki sarkaar par unka puraa niyantran he
 Now, by making his chief warlord the party president, Modi has also prepared to take over the reins of the BJP without isolating the RSS
 shah uttar pradesh main chunaav abhiyaan ko nayaa tevar or bihar main nai jaateey golbandi ko anjaam dekar pehle hi dikhaa chuke hai ki ve aresas kii aakankshaon or modi ke iraadon ke bich saz jameen khoj lene main maahir hai
 This common ground is now to consolidate the benefits of a landslide victory for the party
 loksabhaa chunaav ke prachaar abhiyaan se jude ek varisht bijepi netaa ne india today ko bataaya, “party jab tak chunaav jitati rahati he tab tak aresas modi ko chhot dene ko taiyaar he
 During his campaigning in Uttar Pradesh, Shah appealed to people in his meetings in Muzaffarnagar, Shamli and Bijnor in the first week of April to vote for the BJP to 'avenge the humiliation'
 ve kuch maheene pehle is ilaake main hue sampradayik dangon kii ore sanket kar rahe the, jisase jat or musalmaan ek-duusare ke khun ke pyaase ho gaye the
 The police registered a case against Shah and the Election Commission banned him but his speeches helped polarize voters and bjp's tally in Uttar Pradesh increased from 10 to 71
 bijepi ke netaa kehete hai, “mishan 272+ shah kii soch tha or saakaar ho gaya
 Party workers became extremely excited about the goal of majority
 ” isi tarah, party nikat bhavishya main chunaav vaale rajyon main bhi aise lakshya tay karne kii yojana bana rahi he
 Therefore, Shah's plans as party president will be tested in the upcoming elections in Haryana, Maharashtra, Jharkhand and Delhi
 janvari 2013 main nitin gadakari se party adhyaksh kii kaman lene vaale kendriya grih mantri rajnath singh ne apane kaarykaal ke baaki bache dedh saal ke liye shah ko namjad kiya
 This term will end in 2016
 shah ko iske liye rajasthan bijepi adhyaksh om maathur or himachal pradesh ke purv mantri or party mahasachiv jagat prakaash nadda ko pachhadia padaa
 Though Mathur has received credit for the party's huge success in the November 2013 assembly elections and Lok Sabha elections in Rajasthan with the incumbent Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje, the two leaders are not said to have a cordial relationship
 maathur kii sambhaavna ko samaapt karwaane main is takaraav kii badi bhoomika bataai jaati he, haalanki ve gujarat main modi ke purv sahyogi rahe hai
 Nadda is believed to be a quietly working general secretary who played a major role in strengthening the party organization during the general elections
 lekin unke khilaaf himachal pradesh bijepi main kalah ke beej bone ke aarope hai jiskaa 2012 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main party ko baari khamiyaja uthaanaa padaa tha
 After Shah's name was stamped at the BJP parliamentary board meeting, a senior Union minister said, "only Shah and Sushil Modi's personality fit for the post of president
" yah tay kiya gaya ki susheel ko bihar ke mukhyamantri pad kii ummidavaari ke liye mukt rakhaa jaae, is tarah sirf shah hi baaki rah gaye
 However, this decision was not at all comfortable
 chunki shah ke khilaaf farji muthbhedon ke maamle lambit hai or ve modi ke kareebi hai, isliye aresas ne duusare naamon par bhi vichaar kiya
 But in the end he gave up his arms
 isaki badi vajah yah thi ki amit shah uttar pradesh apane abhiyaan ke dauraan aresas kaaryakartaaon ko khush rakhane main kaamyaab rahe the
 He worked with Sangh leaders Sunil Bansal and Krishna Gopal
 bansal lakhanu main bijepi ke warroom ko sambhaal rahe the
 Says Shah, who worked with Shah's team in the Lok Sabha elections and a BJP leader from the Sangh in 2012, "shah's response is no contact and exchange of information and coordination with RSS workers
" ”iske alaava, sangh yah bhi nahin chahta tha ki purv main 1998 se 2004 ke endie sarkaar vaale samay kii punrariti ho, jab bijepi kii kaman bangaroo lakshmana or kushabhau thakare jaise apekshaakrit chote kad ke netaaon ke haath main thi
 Says a leader in the Vajpayee cabinet, "apart from Venkaiah Naidu, Atal Bihari Vajpayee had no special rapport with other party presidents, especially Jana Krishnamurthy and Thackeray
 ” is netaa ke shabdon main, nateeja yah hua ki endie kaa kaarykaal 2004 main khatm hua to party kaaphi kamjor thi
 The RSS wants the party to consolidate its position in areas where it has an edge in the 2014 elections
 modi bhi yahi chaahate hai
 For this reason, the RSS has included its spokesperson Ram Madhav and Uttar Pradesh convenor Shiv Prakash in Shah's team
 iske alaava, sutron ke mutabik, rashtriya str par sangh or bijepi ke bich talmail ke liye suresh soni kii jagah krishna gopal ko laayaa ja rahaa he
 If all these leaders work in harmony with Shah, as they did in Uttar Pradesh, there is no reason why Modi and the Sangh will not succeed in their common goal

 On the 9th of Muharram, Imam Hussain offered to save his life by leaving the convoy from his companions
 hossain ne kaha ki kal dushmano se hamaara muqabla he or wo behad taqatvar hai, isliye main khushi se ye chahta hum ki aap log yahaan se nikal jaaen
 However, none of his colleagues went
 72 logon kaa hua katlaakhirkaar muharram kii 10 taarikh ko yajid kii fouj ne hossain ke lashkar par hamalaa bol diya
 72 people including Hussain were killed in this war
 inamen hossain ke 6 maheene ke bete ali asagar, 18 saal ke ali akbar or 7 saal ke unke bhattije kasim (hasan ke bete) bhi shahid ho gaye
 After killing Hussain, his houses were set on fire
 jitani auraten or bachche bache unhen ek hi rassi main baandhakar yajid ke darbar le jaaya gaya
 Yajid made everyone his prisoner and put him in jail
 musalamaanon kaa maananaa he ki yajid ne islam ko apane dhang se chalaane ke liye logon par julm kiye
 Yazid slaughtered Hussein, the Nawase of Mohammed, the last prophet of Islam, to become a caliph

 varisht congressi netaa or adhivaktaa kapil sibbal ne is maamle par india today group ke salaahkaar sampadak rajdeep saradesai ke saath baatcheet kii
 Here are the highlights of this conversation
 manmohan-chidambaram se nahin kaha- sin karomahabhiyog ke prastaav par varisht congressi netaaon jaise- purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh or purv vitt mantri pi
 On the question of Chidambam not signing, Sibal said that these two leaders were not asked to sign
 saath hi unhone kaha ki unki party purv piem ko kisi vivaad main nahin ghaseetna chaahati thi, isliye unhen isse dur rakhaa gaya
 Sibal said that Ashwini Kumar and Salman Khurshid are not mps, so their signatures were not taken
 unhone kaha ki is prastaav par vibhinn dalon ke saansadon ke sin kareeb ek maheenaa pehle hi le liye gaye the
 It has nothing to do with the decision in the Loya case
 yah prakriya lambey samay se chal rahi thi
 It was expected that Deepak Mishra would do something
 Sibal said that last week he had asked for time to meet the Vice President, but he had cited busyness
 uparashtrapati ne 20 april ko 12 baje saansadon ko milane ke liye bulaayaa tha, lekin yah prakriya kaaphi pehle se hi shuru ho gai thi, lekin intjaar isliye kiya gaya kyonki mukhya nyaayadhish ke kuch karne kii ummid thi
 Regarding the dismissal of the vice-presidential impeachment motion from the level of vice-president, the judiciary is not a judicial body, Kapil Sibal said that in history it has never been seen, all cases were investigated
 unhone kaha ki uparashtrapati ko sijeai ke khilaaf mahabhiyog prastaav main ginai gai vajahon par koi andeh nahin hona chahie tha
 Sibal further said that it would be right of the committee of judges to decide this
 jaanch ke baad hi saboot saamne aate
 The Vice President should have constituted the committee
 saath hi unhone sawaal kiya ki kya vah khud ko nyaayik sanstha maanate hai, agar aisa he to vah galat hai
 He is not a judge
 vah ucch pad par asin hai, main unke khilaaf koi aarope nahin lagaana chahta hum
 Sorabjee does batting for the BJP, saying that he agrees with Fali Nariman that accusing the Chief Justice is a shameful day for democracy
 unhone kaha ki soli psorabji hameshaa bijepi ke liye batting karte rahe hai
 He said that there is not a single occasion when Sorabji has spoken in favor of the Congress
 naidu ke faisle ke khilaaf supreme court main jaaengeage kii prakriya ke bare main poochne par kapil sibbal ne kaha ki ve is maamle main supreme court main punarvichaar yachika daayar karenge
 He reiterated that the matter should be investigated at the level of the committee of judges
 sibbal ne sawaal kiya ki kya sarkaar yah chaahati he ki mahabhiyog ke bare main jajon kii cameti kii jaanch na ho? unhone kaha ki jaanch se hi pataa chalegaa ki karrwai honi chahie yaa nahin
 Hearing the voice of his conscience, Deepak Misrasibal said that the Modi government is trying to capture the judiciary
 unhone kaha ki keson ke bantwaare main pakshpaat kaa aarope supreme court ke hi chaar jajon ne lagaaya he, congress party ne nahin
 He again reiterated that he would not appear in the cases that CJI Deepak Mishra would hear
 sibbal ne kaha kideepak mishra ko apni antarratma kii aawaaj sunani chahietab koi faisla karnaa chahie
 We want Gangotri to be holy and the judiciary clean

 pakistan ke purv sainya shaasha parvej musharraf ne kaha he ki 9 / 11 hamale ke baad yadi unke mulk ne america sainikon ko apni sarajameen se afghanistan main taliban ke khilaaf abhiyaan chalaane kii ijaajat nahin di hoti, to use sambhavat: ‘america or bharat’ kii sanyukt sena kaa saamana karnaa padataa
 Musharraf told Aaj Tak, Bharatamusharraf, who did not consider himself America, has said in an interview with China's official CCTV in Dubai, 'I do not regret it at all
 mujhe lagata he ki yah bahut sahi faisla tha or yadi mujhase isi halaat ke bare main kaha gaya hota to main yahi faisla karata
 He said that it was decided with full confidence that the Taliban and its ideology is not suitable for Pakistan
 vah is sambhaavna ko lekar bhi chintit the ki yadi america sainikon ne bharat se afghanistan main taliban par hamalaa kiya, to isse pakistan kii samprabhutaa kaa ulanghan hota
 West is biased about India: Musharraf Mushraf said, 'america was going to attack Afghanistan, it was clear
 ve kahaan se hamalaa kar sakate the? bharat se
 
 or bharat sabhi tarah kii suvidhaayen dene ko taiyaar tha
 Musharraf said, "what would have happened if American soldiers had come from India and we were not with them?" Then Pakistan would have to compete with America and India together because if they went to Afghanistan through Pakistan then our sovereignty in land and air border would be violated
 ’paak ke liye ‘bhale vyakti ’hai manmohan singh: musharrafunhone kaha, ‘isliye yah pakistan ke hit main bilkul nahin tha
 While allowing American troops to campaign from Pakistan, he considered what effect it might have on Pakistan by favoring the Taliban
 purv sainya shaasha ne kaha, ‘maine is par vichaar kiya ki tarafdaari karne yaa nahin karne kaa kya prabhaav hoga
 The first question that came to my mind was that do we want to educate Pakistan? Are we in favor of the Taliban? Do we want that kind of government in Pakistan? Are our views on Islam the same as that of the Taliban? They said, 'I do not want the ideology of Taliban and Taliban in Pakistan, so why should i join them in the initial phase?' When he was criticized for his decision to kill 35,000 civilians in this regard, he said that the figure you are talking about, you should go into details

 Actually, Maudi and Lalu want to rally in the same ground on 3 March in Muzaffarpur
 bijepi ne iskaa elaan pehle kiya tha
 Lalu then came to the beach and said that he would also rally on the same day to stop the communal forces
 maamle par mukhyamantri nitish kumaar se poocha gaya to unhone kaha, 'yah 'media kii darlings' ke bich kaa maamla he, isamen main kaha hum main to upekshit jamaat kaa pratinidhitiv karata hum
 Nitish Kumar's displeasure is that he is not getting the desired coverage in the media despite holding a Sankalp rally in Bihar
 mujffarpur ke usee maidan main kuch din pehle unhone sankalp raily kii thi lekin nitish kaa aarope he ki media ne use dikhaaya hi nahin or jo raily hone vaali he use bada mudda banaaya ja rahaa rahaa he
 Nitish also said that he has nothing to do with this dispute
 unhone kaha, 'yah jila prashasan tay karata he or pehle aavedan karne vaale ko maidan miltaa he
 If there is a problem, then there are courts above
 ' With the completion of one year of demonetisation, there has been debate about what the country has lost and gained
 sarkaar jahaan faisle ko 'aitihaasik' bataate hue apni peeth thonkate nahin thak rahi
 On the other hand, the opposition is preparing to celebrate 'black day' on 8 November, calling demonetisation as 'the biggest scam of the century'
 isi bahes ke bich ek front jarur aisa he jahaan notebandi ke sakaaratmak parinaam dekhne ko mili hai
 This is the front of security
 notebandi main 500 or 1000 rupye ke note band hone se naksaliyon, aatankwaadiyon or hawala kaarobaariyon kii qamar jarur buree tarah tuuti he
 Demonetisation has made the Naxalites bankrupt by breaking the funding chain
 vahiin aisi bhi report he ki teror funding par notebandi se karaari chot pahunchane se aatankwaadi bhi baukhalaahat main lutere ban gaye or darjan bhar se zyada bank lut kii ghatnaon ko anjaam de daalaa
 Good results of demonetisation were also seen that there has been a significant reduction in the incidents of stone pelting in Kashmir compared to last year
 grih mantralay ke sutron ke mutabik beete saal ghati main patharbaji kii 2800 ghatnaayen hui thim
 At the same time, only 600 such incidents were seen in the current year
 pehle ye dekha jaataa tha ki jab bhi koi aatanki maaraa jaataa to patharbaji kii ghatnaayen bad jaati thim
 But so far 198 militants have been piled up by security forces in the current year, yet the incidents of stone pelting have come down dramatically
 jaahir he aisi sthiti laane main notebandi kaa khaasaa asar rahaa
 The central government claims that the nefarious game of printing fake currency notes of India in Quetta and Karachi in Pakistan's official printing presses has been ruined by demonetisation
 kendriya grih rajya mantri hansraj ahir ke mutabiknotbandise aatankiyon kii funding par lagaam lagi he
 At the same time there has been a decrease in the incidents of stone pelting in Kashmir
 hansraj ahir kaa daawa he ki notebandi kii vajah se aatanki ghatnaon main 25 se 30 fisadi kami ai he
 The terrorists broke the chain of funding and the terrorists got so much money that some terrorists started the bank robbery
 kendriya grih rajya mantri hansraj ahir ke mutabik notebandi kaa ye asar bhi rahaa ki naksaliyon ko khaane ke laale pad gaye
 The illegal money collected by the Naxalites was all wasted
 suraksha maamalon ke jaankaar pi ke sahagal kaa bhi maananaa he kinotbandi kii vajahase naksali sanghathanon kaa puraa aarthik dhaancha charmara gaya he
 He had a large amount of cash which was found in the soil as soon as 500 and 1000 notes were closed
 suraksha balon ne isi dauraan oparation prahaar chalaakar naksaliyon par dohari maar kii
 1700 Naxalites were captured and 600 surrendered
 isi dauraan suraksha balon se muthbhed ke dauraan 130 naksaliyon ko maar giraaya gaya
 There were also incidents where Naxalites seized the tendu leaves and money collected from the recovery
 notebandi ke arthvyavastha par parinamko lekar beshak bahes chhidi ho lekin naksalwad or aatankwaad se ladaai ke morche par ye faisla jarur kargar rahaa he
 In the Ishrat Jahan fake encounter case, the CBI on Thursday filed a supplementary charge sheet in the special court
 jisamen gujarat main ibi ke pramukh rahe rajendra kumaar or teen anya afasaron ke khilaaf hatya or sajeesh kaa aarope lagaaya gaya he
 But the charge sheet does not name Amit Shah, former Gujarat home minister, who was questioned by the CBI in the Ishrat case
 sibiai ne apni is poorak chargeshit main gujarat main ibi ke pramukh rahe rajendra kumaar ke saath IB ke adhikari pi mittal, rajeev vankhede or emke sinha ke khilaaf hatya or sajeesh kaa aarope lagaaya gaya he
 All these officers of the IB have been charged under sections 120 A, 302, 341,364, 25 (A & B) Arms Act of IPC
 saath hi rajendra kumaar par avaidh hathiyaar rakhane kaa bhi aarope he
 The CBI has not taken any action against Amit Shah in the charge sheet at present, but the CBI has not even said in the court that this is the final charge sheet in this case

 We had said that if we forgive the debt of farmers, we did it in Rajasthan

 Former Prime Minister Dr

 a new text is being written in the politics of Uttar Pradesh with the joint press talks of Mayawati and Akhilesh Yadav
 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main narendra modi ko maat dene liye 23 saal puraani dushmani bhulaakar sapa-basapa soobe main ek baar phir gathbandhan kii raah par hai
 Like the mulayam-kanshi Ram duo who defeated the BJP riding the Ram Mandir movement in 1993, the akhilesh-mayawati duo is being formed to defeat the party riding on the Modi wave
 haalanki 1993 se lekar 2019 tak ganga-gomti or yamuna main bahut pani bah chukaa he
 This is the reason why repeating the results like 25 years ago is considered a big challenge for this alliance with maya-akhilesh
 sapa-basapa gathbandhan main seat sherindkhilesh yadav or mayawati congress ko alag rakhkar soobe main gathbandhan kar rahe hai
 It can be announced by the two leaders in their joint conference on Saturday
 seat shering formula bhi tabhi saamne aayega
 It is believed that SP will contest 36 and BSP 37 seats
 areldi ke liye 3 siten jabaki pis party, nishad party jaise dalon ke liye 2 siten rigerv rakhi ja sakati hai
 The alliance will not field its candidates in Amethi and Rae Bareli seats
 sapa-basapa ke gathbandhan ke baad raajnneetik pandit maanakar chal rahe hai ki bijepi ke liye soobe kii raah aasaan nahin hogi
 For this, he is giving the example of the SP-BSP alliance in 1993, but if the political environment and political equation is seen in the current political environment, then the situation is not as it was 25 years ago
 mandal andolan ke daur main mulaayam-kanshiramdrasal sapa-basapa ne 25 saal pehle jab haath milaayaa tha vah daur mandal kaa tha, jisane soobe ke hi nahin balki desh ke pichhadon ko ek chhatari ke neeche laakar khadaa kar diya tha
 Mulayam Singh Yadav emerged as a prominent OBC leader and the Muslim electorate was also united with him due to the Ram Temple movement
 iske alaava kanshiram bhi dalit or obisi jatiyon ke netaa banakar ubhare the
 In such a situation, when both of them joined hands, the hope of social justice was raised
 isi kaa nateeja tha ki babari masjid vidhwans ke baad bhi bijepi satta main vaapasi nahin kar pai thi
 However, this alliance broke up in 1995, after which a deep gap was created between the Yadavs and the Dalits
 soobe kaa jaateey samikarnasoobe main is samay 22 fisadi dalit voter hai, jinamein 14 fisadi jatav or chamaar shaamil hai
 This is the strongest vote of the BSP
 jabaki baaki 8 fisadi dalit matadaataaon main paasi, dhobi, khatic musahar, coli, valmiki, gond, kharwar sahit 60 jatiyaan hai
 At the same time, around 45 percent of OBC voters are there
 inamen yadav 10 fisadi, kurmi 5 fisadi, maury 5 fisadi, lodhi 4 fisadi or jat 2 fisadi hai

 With the non-yadav OBC and non-jatav Dalit BJP, the BJP has managed to merge the non-yadav OBC and non-jatav Dalits in the 2014 and 2017 assembly elections to increase its support base in UP
 isi kaa nateeja he ki pehle loksabhaa or phir vidhansabha main bijepi ke saamne sapa-basapa puri tarah se dharaashahee ho gai thim
 OBC thinker Rakesh Kushwaha says that after the BJP came to power, these Dalits and OBC castes have also been made partners in the government
 itnaa hi nahin obisi ko milane vaale 27 fisadi aarakshan ko bhi bijepi teen category main baantne kii ranneeti par kaam kar rahi he
 In such a situation, the biggest challenge for the SP-BSP alliance will be to connect these Dalit and OBC castes with themselves
 darasal sapa basapa par aarope lagata rahaa he ki ve yadav, muslim or jatvon kii party hai
 While in the current politics, political consciousness is awakened within non-yadav obcs and non-jatav Dalits, in such a situation, it will be hard for Akhilesh and Mayawati to be defeated by the BJP
 sapa-basapa ke liye chunautiyanraajnneetik vishleshak sunil kumaar suman ne kaha ki upi main sapa-basapa ke bich gathbandhan ke saamne sabase badi chunauti voton ko transfar kii he
 In the seats where the Samajwadi Party is fighting, the bsp's vote can be transferred, but in the seats where the BSP is contesting, the sp's vote transfer can be difficult
 ye ashanka isliye bhi he ki abhi haalia elahabaad vishvavidhyalay chunaav ke nateezon ko dekhen to samaajawaadee chaatr sabha se adhyaksh pad par udai prakaash yadav ne bade antar se jeet hasil kii, lekin upaadhyaksh pad par sapa pratyaashee munesh kumaar saroj na sirf bade antar se chunaav haare balki tisare number par chale gaye
 At the same time, nsui's Akhilesh Yadav's third biggest challenge to win this seat, how will the SP and BSP transfer their voters to the seats in which the Muslim candidates from the alliance will contest? Because Muslim majority seats are more prone to communal polarization
 2014 ke samikarngauratalab he ki 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main upi kii 80 sansadeey siton main se bijepi gathbandhan main 73 siten jeetne main safal rahi thi or baaki 7 siten vipaksh ko mili thim
 BJP got 71 seats, Apna Dal 2, Congress 2 and SP 5 seats
 basapa kaa khaataa tak nahin khul sakaa tha
 However, by-elections have been held in 3 Lok Sabha seats of the state, out of which SP has won 2 and RLD on one
 is tarah bijepi ke paas 68 siten bachi hai or sapa kii 7 siten ho gai hai
 On the strategic front, India has taken a big step to meet the challenges and give tough competition to China

 After that almost all of Bhojpuri superstars have acted with them
 khesari laal yadav, pawan singh, dinesh laal yadav, ritesh pandeya jaise stars ke saath kaam karke behad unhone apni alag pahchaan bana lee he
 Let us tell you that in the year 2018, Akshara Singh's performance was very much seen in Bhojpuri film world and became very popular among the youth
 tab bhi vah apane gaanon, stage shoj or filmon ko lekar wo hameshaa charche main raheen thim

 jald hi akshara singh (akshara Singh) kii kai filmein pradarshit hone vaali hai
 Qazi Mufti Azhar Hussain of Deoband city of Uttar Pradesh says that the wedding in which dancing and DJ will be used, they will not get 'nikah' done there
 unka kahana he ki ye sab islam ke khilaaf he, ham is tarah kii shaadi se kinaaraa karenge
 Mufti Azhar Hussain said that if there is music or dance before Nikah, then it is a different matter
 kehete hai jab vakt bura hota he, to har chaal ulti padati he
 Something similar is happening now with ISIS
 ek taraf mukhiya abu bakar al bagdadi ke maut kii khabar iske aatankwaadiyon ko daraa rahi he, to duusari taraf maidan jang main har roj maat mil rahi he
 The latest case is from the city of Falluja in Iraq, where ISIS militants were forced to send a truck loaded with ammo to the enemy camp
 dushmano se pehle ye trek khud hi iesas kaa taabut ban gaya
 Truck loaded with gunpowder This truck is running at full speed on a highway in Faluja city, 65 km from Baghdad, the capital of Iraq
 vaise to is trek ko dekhakar is baat kaa andaaza lagaana mushkil he ki is trek main kya ladaa he or ye kis makasad se aage bad rahaa he, lekinaiessse aamane-saamne kii jang main shaamil virdohi guton ko isaki asaliyat khub pataa he
 Actually, this truck full of ammo is a coffin running on six wheels, which can ruin all the things around it as well
 suicide bombar hai driverbarood se bhare is trek ko iesas ke vosuicide bombarchalaa rahe hai, jinhen khaas mishan par apane dushmano ko target karne ke liye bheja gaya he or is vakt is trek ke target par virodhiyon kaa ek aisa base camp he, jahaan deraa daale iraqi fouj or alag-alag deshon ke javanaiessse loha le rahe hai
 Therefore, the opponents themselves decide to target the truck itself before it becomes the target of this truck and then pressing a button, the truck turns into a circle of fire
 virodhiyon ke radar par aa chukaa he trekadrasal, isfidain hamalaavaronvala ye trek kaaphi pehle hi virodhiyon ke radar par aa chukaa tha, lekin wo ise target karne se pehle sahi maukey or sahi jagah kaa intjaar kar rahe the, taaki nishaanaa sahi lage or khud unhen koi nuksaan naa ho
 In this way, as soon as the truck reached a sand dune, the acanti tank rocket fired by the opponents blew the truck's wrenches in the blink of an eye
 trek aag ke gole main badal gaya or fouran hi isaki raftaar par brake bhi lag gaya
 The picture of it has gone viral on social media, the picture of a truck coming out of Iraq's maidan-e-jung has gone viral on social media, but this is not the first and only picture of war with ISIS in countries like Syria and Iraq
 isse pehle bhi maanav bamon se laden aise trakon ke alag-alag thikaanon par dhamaake or thikaanon par pahunchane se pehle hi unhen udaae jane kii kai tasviren saamne aa chuki hai
 In fact, this is a game of deception
 zyaadaatar maamalon main aise trakon ko chalaanevaale fidaayin hamalaavaron ko khud is baat kaa pataa nahin hota ki trek barood se bharaa he or wo khud ek fidaayin he
 The terrorists send their cheats to enemy targets and are asked to call from the given mobile phone, but the call from the mobile phone completes the circuit of IED and detonates ammo
