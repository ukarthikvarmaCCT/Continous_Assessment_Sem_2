 The only complaint is that the injustice that has come to the justice of a hero like Salman Khan, and the injustice that has been done for a lapse of justice, only awakens in our common and special people when the case of a man who comes Be very large or represent their class interests
 tippaniyan In a country where about three lakh people are rotting in jails waiting for the trial to start, where many innocent people can spend their entire life and come out of the jails, if only by the idea of their soft-hearted hero going to jail If many people of the country shed their tears, then it should be understood that their mothering is blind to justice and is insulting humanity
 ye baat pate kii salmaan khan par nahin, us hindustan par he jo isliye itane bhayanak anyaay karata or jhelta he or ek amanviya gairbarabari se ankhen moond kar chalata rahata he
 Of course, he should be thankful to his Bollywood heroes - it would not have been easy for him to cross this buzzing street of truth if there was no fresh fragrance of his colorful screen

 ' After eight years in India, Mithu Sen's solo show is "anamithu - Byproduct of 20 Years of Performance"
 yah pradarshnee mumbai kii chemold presscott road par 31 janvari se 8 march ke bich khuli thi
 Mithu was born in West Bengal in 1971 and studied painting at the Kala Bhavan Institute of Fine Art of Viswan Bharati University, Santiniketan
 unka samoochaa kaam us jindagi kaa aks he jo unhone ji he
 His work at the India Art Fair stood like a set of four books: the first three books have outstretched lips and the fourth has an iron press with a raised penis
 apni theme ke bare main ve kahati hai, ''main waisi hum jaise ''meri" asweekruti rahi he, har koi faisla suna detaa rahaa he ki mujhe kya hona chahie
 "sen speaks of his father jokingly saying that he would have to pay a huge dowry because of his dark complexion and even when a bus conductor in Mahabalipuram, Tamil Nadu asked him in local language They talked and when they told that they did not know this language, they came down on the abuses
 sen kahati hai ki ve apni kalakritiyon ko bhent karke kala kii duniya kii maang or supplai kii fitrat kaa muqabla karne kii koshish kar rahi hai
 "life is a medium for me," says Sen
 haas-parihaas us sagar kaa ek nanha-sa hissaa he
 i like to play with serious issues, so dilligi becomes a good tool for me to speak
 main apni hi kamajoriyon or bikli kaa istemaal karti hum
 When the audience laughs, that human sympathy breaks the barriers of the enormous issues with which i deal

 "she says," i use "non" as an ornament
 jab ise sangya, kriya visheshan or visheshan ke purv joda jaataa he, to yah us lafj ke myne ko ulat detaa he
 "non" is a linguistic tool that opens up layers of possible expressions of my work
 vah sab kuch ho saktaa he—siyaasi, saamaajik, nijee, yonik, alangik
 It is a deliberate intervention with issues, so it is political
 main kah rahi hum ki ek pahchaan or tamaam (gaiyr) pahachaanen siyaasi hi hai
 "while she is blasting the language through her works in the exhibition, she says that she is also" paying attention to human relationships by reversing the established ways of communicating and thus to address the mind and human behavior

 Obama told reporters yesterday after a meeting with his national security team at the Pentagon, as we have seen, finding and stopping lonely terrorists or small groups of terrorists willing to kill themselves and kill innocent people
 It is still very difficult
 isliye, is abhiyaan main ham har morche par iesael :iesas: par aakraamakata ke saath karrwai karne vaale hai
 He said that the United States and its coalition partners have been steadfast in their fight against the Islamic State, but the group still has the ability to direct and motivate attacks
 unhone kaha, aisa prathit hota he ki syria or iraq main iesael ke kamjor padane ke kaaran use aisi tarkiben apnaani pad rahi hai, jo hamane pehle kabhi nahin dekhin
 Among them, more emphasis is being placed on hypophile terrorist attacks

 The US President said that the terrorist groups knew that they were to be defeated and, sending a message to their followers, they began to accept that they could lose in Mosul and Raqqa

 We will continue to attack and chase them until their feet are uprooted

 Therefore, in this campaign we are going to act aggressively on ISIL (ISIS) on every front

 Priyanka Gandhi will enter the field with the new organization of the state to strengthen the political ground of the Congress in the state

 Since the defeat in the Lok Sabha elections, Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi has been holding meetings with party leaders and workers continuously

 Priyanka used to meet and brainstorm with workers and leaders of Uttar Pradesh from 9 am to 8 pm

 In this way Priyanka has taken command of the entire Uttar Pradesh
 in baithkon ke jariye priyanka gandhi ek johari kii tarah netaaon ke bich hira taraash rahi hai
 This is the reason why the new Congress Committee will not only be smaller than before, but there will be more representation of youth and women in it
 priyanka gandhi kii koshish he ki jameen se jude sangharkshil kaaryakartaaon or netaaon ko sanghathan main zyada tavajjo mili
 He will be given importance in Priyanka's new team, who are loyal to the party and have struggled in bad times and have not left the Congress
 is baar uttar pradesh kii cameti main pichhali baar se 10 guna kam sadsy honge or sabaki ausat umr 38-40 saal hogi

 In the blueprint being prepared by the Congress organization, in every district, the district vice-president will be commanded by the woman
 bataa den ki uttar pradesh main congress kaa sanghathan naa ke baraabar he
 This is the reason why the Congress has been facing a drought of power for the last 24 years
 aise main congress ke liye uttar pradesh main majboot netaaon or kaaryakartaaon kii talash karnaa registan main pani dhundne jaisaa he

 He says that he does not know about Twitter, so he was not aware that Mayawati had tweeted and directed him to support Kumaraswamy government
 bengaluru main ek press conference ko sambodhit karte hue kaha, 'main tivetor yaa uske bare main kuch bhi nahin jaanata
 So, when i was going to Bangalore i came to know (about expulsion)
 communication gep kii vajah se mujhe party se nikaala gaya

 Sodium glucamate or monosodium glutamate is used in most foods
 restaurant main parose jane vaale bhojan main bhi is safed padaarth kaa jamkar istemaal hota he kyonki isse bhojan kaa swaad bad jaataa he
 It is naturally present in many foods but is also mixed separately in processed food

 Monosodium glutamate (MSG) is added to foods to enhance flavor
 bhale hi yah bhojan kaa swaad badha detaa ho lekin iske zyada seven se nerve system par bura asar padataa he

 Processed foods are already harmful and cause further harm due to MSG
 aage kuch bhi kharidne se pehle packet par check kar len ki MSG maujuud he yaa nahin
 If the ingredient has MSG written then avoid eating it
 rasaynic taur par prakritik taur par khaane main paae jane vaale ems or processd food main maujuud MSG main koi fark nahin hota he
 But due to high amount of MSG in processed food or the presence of other harmful substances, it can prove more dangerous
 yah canned food, sos, chips, packet band soup, hot dog, bear jaisi chizon main hota he
 Apart from this, it is naturally present in cheese, tomatoes, peas, walnuts, wheat
 sodium glutamet kii zyada khuraaq ko bhukh badhane, motopa va anya metabolic disorder se jodakar dekha jaataa he
 Excess intake of sodium glutamate can cause problems like migraine, lethargy, hormone imbalance, vomiting, weakness, chest pain
 isse khaane kaa swaad bad jaataa he jisase log zyada kha lete hai
 The result is obesity and overweight

 com / g2wjtyc7e9— Vijay Television (@vijayte Television) May 15, 2019 Kamal has decided to host the show despite its busy schedule
 jahaan tak baat sho main is baar shaamil hone vaale mehmaanon kii he to iskaa khulaasa hona abhi baaki he
 Tell the host of the show Kamal Haasan that he has been in constant controversy for some time
 camel hasan haal hi main die gaye apane ek bayaan ke chalate surkhiyon main hai
 He said referring to Nathuram Godse, the murderer of Mahatma Gandhi, that the first terrorist of independent India was a Hindu
 unke is bayaan ke baad vivaad bad gaya or maamla pehle chunaav ayog or phir hai court ke paas gaya
 The court refused to hear the petition of BJP leader Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay
 iske baad camel hasan ne apni chunavi reliyon ko bhi sthagit kar diya tha
 In the world of literature in independent India, among those who wrote and talked most, Namwar Singh is the foremost
 unki aisi koi kitaab nahin jis par vaad-vivaad or samvaad na hua ho
 In the last decades of the last century, they became more of the oral tradition
 desh bhar main gum-ghumkar ve apane vyakhyanon, saakshatkaaron se saanskrithik halchal utpann karte rahe
 In such a situation, it was rare to expect a well-organized book from him
 prachur maatra main unka likhaa-bolaa asanklit hi tha
 From 2010, this unsystematic written-book began to come and by 2012 eight such books came
 beete saal phir unki paanch kitaaben ai hai jo nishchay hi hindi sansar ke liye aakarshan kaa vishay hai
 The first among these books is puvarang
 isamen namvar ji kaa praarambhik aalochana lekhan he, jise padhate hue unke buniyadi sarokaaron or ruchiyon kaa pataa chalata he
 How relevant is his saying in a 1959 lecture, "modern literature is not as complicated as it is more than its complexity
" or jinke upar is bhram ko dur karne kii jimmedaari thi, unhone bhi ise badhaane main yoga diya
 "here, while referring to 'simplification', he says," The new Acharyas quoted how many classical things carrying this word
 or nateeja? vidhyaarthiyon par unke acharyatv kii pratishtha bhale ho gai ho, nai kavita kii ek bhi jatilta nahin sulajhi
 Namvar ji's intellect and intellectual ability are also seen in these early writings
 nai kavita par yahaan chaar-paanch aalekh hai, jinamein un sthapanaaon ke beej milte hai jo kavita ke nae pratimaan main aakaar le rahi thim
 In the second section of the book, there are many small and large comments written by Vishnu Chandra Sharma's magazine pseudonym 'kavimitra'
 1955 kii ek tippanee drashtavy he, ''mujhe yah kehane main tanik bhi sankoch nahin he ki chitra-chayan or chitra rachana arthath chitron dwaara upyukt ragabodh ke pattern ke nirmaan kii jaisi kshamta kedarnath singh main he waisi aaj kisi kavi main nahin he
 "this section contains articles on Muktibodh, Bhawaniprasad Mishra, Ekanta Shrivastava, Bhalchandra Nemade which is an overview of the importance of the creators
" raghuveer sahay kii kavita vasant or hajaari prasad dvivedi ke upanyaas banbhatta kii aatmakatha kii nayika nipunika par swatantra aalekh bhi aalochak ke vishwast bayaan hai
 The last section contains comments on the then country-society, politics for the Jan Yuga
 duusari kitaab aalochana or samvaad main alag-alag vishyon par namvar ji ke 25 lekh hai jinka lekhankaal failaa hua he or vishay vaividhya bhi chaunkaane vaala he
 The first article is on the outline of world literature, then a further article is on Indian literature of the twentieth century
 is pustak main amir khusro, rahul sankrutyaayan, ambedkar, firaaq gorakhpuri, agyeya, shrilaal shungal, shamsher bahadur singh, pash, shaani jaise rachanakaaron par aalekh hai to bharat-bharti or malayaj kii diary par swatantra vivechan bhi
 This book also gives an opportunity to read articles related to many topics of language and literature and special articles are also available here on linguistic topics related to Sanskrit and Urdu
 'shamsher ke saath aakhri mulaakaat' sheershak aalekh apni prakruti main sansmaran ke najadik ho gaya he or namvar ji apane priy kavi ko samooche man kii gaharaai se yaad karte hai
 There is also an article on social awareness of medieval poets
 bhoomika main ashish treepathi ne uchit hi likhaa he ki ''nibandhon kii is shrunkhlaa main koi aantarik anviti nahin he
 It is not focused on any one topic or series of topics
 kisi ek saahitiyik vidha tak bhi ye simit nahin
 Therefore, this compilation should be read and read in the order of 'history and Criticism' and 'debate Dialogue'
 ''pustak main ek bhi aalekh aisa nahin jo namvar ne likhit taiyaar na kiya ho
 In the third book Dwabha, there are some articles written by Namvar Ji which are divided into two sections
 pehle khand main samskruti, bhashaa, sahitya or itihaas par aalekh hai to duusare khand main kai rachanakaaron par chote-chote aalekh in rachanakaaron ke mahatv kaa ankan hi hai
 Namvar ji is in favor of pluralism in culture
 unke likhe-bole kii badi chintaaon main saanskrithik bahultawad he
 The first article of this book is on this subject which is the written form of a lecture given in 2015
 yahaan unhone kaha he ki ''saanskrithik rashtrawaad se hamaare desh kii saanskrithik bahulata ko jitna khatra he, utana hi, balki usase zyada khatra he—us bahurashtriya poonjeevaad se banane vaali bazaar kii samskruti se, jise upabhokta samskruti bhi kehete hai
 
 
 The danger is more because the diversity from the top, the diversity on the surface and the basic element is its uniformity
 maal kaa brand alag-alag
 The first section contains two articles related to the history of Hindi story which also presents the role of Namvarji's general concepts in relation to the story
 pragatisheel andolan se jude teen aalekh bhi yahaan hai jo bhakthi andolan ke baad bharat main hue sabase bade saanskrithik andolan kaa ujjwal paksh darshaate hai
 He has also given an article on a genre considered neglected like Navgeet
 duusare khand main rachanakaaron par aae aalekhon main miraan, rahim, tukaraam, gaalib, premchand, rahul sankrutyaayan, shivapujan sahay, sajaad jahir, hajariprasad dvivedi, mahadevi verma, trilochan, harishankar parasaai, shrilaal shukla, vishnukant shastri, rajendra yadav, markandeya, nirmala jain, dushyant kumaar, kuber dutt or rajaneta chandrashekhar par choti-choti tippaniyan hai
 While these comments show the importance of the deliverance of the concerned, at the same time, Namvar Ji's memoirs are made at many places
 pustak kaa sheershak dwabha uchit hi he, smritiyon or sahitya vivechan kii do aabhaaen
 Chhayvad: The book titled Prasad, Nirala, Mahadevi and Pant is a compilation of the criticism related to Chhatism from Namvar's famous book Chhavaism
 is pustak kii praasangikta is baat main he ki 1955 main chhayavaad par suvyavasthit pustak ke baad is vishay par unke vichaaron kaa sakvayak sankalan yahaan ek saath ho paaya he
 There is also an interview with one and a half dozen articles on cinematography taken by Kiran Singh
 pustak main kamayani, roopabh or pralay kii chaaya jaisi rachanaaon par swatantra aalekh hai vahiin chhayavaad ke vibhinn pakshon par vichaar karne ke saath namvar ji ne jin chhayavaadi rachanakaaron par likhaa he, ve sabhi aalekh yahaan aa gaye hai
 Their close attention has also been paid to the language of these creators
 ve likhte hai—''prasad ruchir gadhy ke shilpi the
 Strawberry will not be found anywhere
 '' aage ''niraala kii bhashaa niraala ke gadhy se ai he; kullibhaat se ai he, jo chote-chote vaakyon main he
 Nirala was breaking prose and on the other hand was giving poetry a new language of prose
 '' mahadevi ke sambandh main—''mahadevi ne rahasy se zyada satya ke bare main likhaa he
 The literature of Mahadevi is the literature of struggle, the literature of struggle
 '' or ''vichaardhaara kis tarah kavita ko kshati pahunchaati he, pantaji kaa parvarti kavy uske pramaanon main se he
 "there is also an article in the book on shadowy criticism which is going to fulfill the need of this subject
" antim pustak he ramvilas sharma, murdhanya aalochak ramvilas ji par unke samast likhe kaa ek sankalan
 Apparently this compilation is made by choosing material from previously published books
 hindi ke sahitya sansar main sharma or namvar ko do dhruvon main baantkar dekhne-vyavhaar karne kaa chalan ban gaya he par kya vaaki aisa he? namvar ji kii yah pustak ramvilas ji par shraddhabhaav se bhare aalekh 'keval jalati mashaal' se prarambh hokar 'itihaas kii shav-sadhana' par puri hoti he
 There are more than a dozen articles here on Ram Vilas ji and the subjects related to them, then in the appendix, the words of Namvar ji have been sorted out in the interviews
 donon aalochakon main sahmati-asahmati ke anek pakshon ko dekhati-samajhati yah pustak hindi aalochana ke bhavy vitan ko upasthit karne vaali he
 Namvar ji also says in an interview, "as an heir i have questioned Ram Vilas ji because Ram Vilas ji's writing is our cultural heritage
 ''in pustakon ke sampadakon kramshah ashish treepathi, vijay prakaash singh or gyanendra kumaar santosh ne apane adhyavsaay se ek kathin or dussadhay kaary ko sambhav kiya he
 For the Hindi Sahitya Samaj, these books undertake to see and understand their great critics, so the material contained in them is not less in any sense

 If anyone is expecting me to be diplomatic, i can't be that's why I'm not in politics Farah Khan Ali, who is always active on social media, is constantly tweeting about the election trends

 Within 48 hours of the formation of the 'SPX party', it has come into controversy
 party ke purv sansthaapak lalit shastri ne aarope lagaaya kisapaks partibanaate vakt niyamon kaa paalan nahin kiya gaya
 In fact, on Tuesday, SPX launched a political party moving ahead of the agitation and announced to field candidates for all 230 seats of Madhya Pradesh Legislative Assembly
 iske baad 48 ghante ke bheetar hi sapaks party vivaadon main aa gai, kyonki iske purv sansthaapak lalit shastri ne party ke gathan par sawaal uthaate hue ise avaidh bataaya he
 According to him, only the party that can get elected by the Election Commission, but this is not the case with the SP party
 aachaar samhitalagu hone se pehle manyata nahin mili to sapaks party chunaav nahin lard sakegi
 Shastri said that he has already split from the SPX party and joined a new party 'unreserved Samaj Party', which is not only recognized by the Election Commission, but has also got the election symbol
 vahiin, sapaks party ne iskaa khandan karte hue kaha ki lalit shastri pehle hi sapaks kaa saath chhod chuke hai
 In such a situation, his statement is of no importance
 sapaks partike heeralaal trivedi ke mutabik chunaav ayog main party ke registration ke liye prakriya shuru kar di gai he
 The documents have been sent to the Election Commission for registration of the party and the Commission has also issued a notification in this regard
 trivedi ne bataaya ki chunaav ayog ne paper main vigyaapan dekar aapattiyaan bhi maangi hai
 In Madhya Pradesh, the atmosphere is hot about the reservation in reservation and the Atrocity Act, and in such a situation, forming a common group among themselves is no less than a major setback for the entire movement

 pune ke baraamati sahakaari bank ke teen acount holders ne aarope lagaaya he ki unke acount main kaala paisa jamaa kiya gaya he
 After hearing the Prime Minister's speech, he got information about it when he updated his passbook
 acount holder jab acount afasar ke saamne aae to adhikariyon kii citti pitti gum ho gai
 Officers began to tremble
 aisa laga jaise unhen saanp soongh gaya ho
 Now if you remember Prime Minister Narendra Modi's speech where Modi says "in whose account others have put money
 ye paise garib vaise hi rahane de , notebandi kaa ye sara maamla thik thaak hone tak , pachaas dinon tak
 There will be a problem of fifty days
 aap ye paisa yun hi rakhe rahenge to main koi rasta nikaaloongaa
 Right now, i am brainwashing that whoever has illegally put money in the accounts of the poor, go to jail and get money in the house of the poor ”
 bainkon main he shaatir dimag waalon kii bharamaadab aisa lagata he ke agar pradhanmantri modi ne master stroke khelaa he to unase bhishaatir dimagvaale bainkon main baithe hai
 On the one hand, while Modi is spending his mind on how the poor are getting money illegally deposited in the accounts of the poor, on the other hand, there have been three such cases in Pune
 jahaan garibon ke acount main assi-assi hajaar rupee daale gaye 
 These money were poured on the 17th and 19th of November for 40-40 thousand rupees
 pradhanmantri kaa bhaashan sunne ke baad bank acount main aae paise kaa pataa chalapradhanmantri modi kaa bhaashan sunne ke baad pune ke bhosri ilaake ke baraamati sahakaari bank ke teen acount dharko ne apane paas book apadet karaaye
 Then these poor people felt that what the Prime Minister said was proved to be true
 unke acount main paise aae hai ab ghar main khushiyaan bhi aaengi
 People also remembered the words of the Prime Minister that money is not to be withdrawn from the account
 jaise hi is acount holder ko passbook apadet main dikhaa ki koi uske acount se paisa nikaal rahaa he to is shaks ne tay kiya ki wo apana paisa RTGS ke jariye duusare acount main transfar kar legaa
 What did the account holders say? Account holder Devraj Devpal says that forty thousand rupees came to the account without his knowledge
 bank main poochtacha main bataaya gaya ki unka khaataa band he
 While these money were poured on 17 and 19 November
 is dauraan 15 hajaar rupee nikaal bhi liye gaye
 When he asked for the check yesterday, he was told that there is no money in the account
 acount dharak or shikayatakarta bhagwaan singh kaargi kehete hai kipassbook apadetakaraane par unhen bahut der tak roka gaya
 Later it was said that the account was locked
 agreement or aadhaar card laane ko kaha gaya
 When he saw his account balance from the ATM, he saw sixty five thousand rupees
 ajtak se baatcheet main kya kehete hai bank ke afasar?ajtak ne jab is maamle main sidhe bank jaakar acount afasar in logon ke acount main bina jaankaree paise daalane or nikaalane kii baat kahi to afasar mukar gaye
 At first, the account officer named Suryavanshi flatly denied that there was no talk of putting such money, but when Aaj Tak presented the account holder to this account officer, then his Sitti Pitti was lost
 aisa laga jaise use saanp soongh gaya ho
 However, he still did not believe that something went wrong
 vah kahata rahaa ki sirf printing mistek hui he 
 When the officer was asked why he kept the money in the account for one month in case of printing mismatch, he could not answer anything
 iske baad bhi adhikari ne passbook kii entry dekhi or isi baat par tikaa rahaa ki sirf printing mistek hui he
 They could not clarify the allegations leveled by the three account holders
 aisa mana ja rahaa he ki agar sahi tareeke se sahakaari banks ke sabhi acounts kii jaanch hoti he to bade ghapale kaa bhandaphod ho saktaa he

 He had also said that Ashok Gehlot kept concentrating only on Jodhpur seat

 Delhi government has implemented this scheme twice in 2016
 ek baar 1 janvari se lekar 15 janvari tak or dobaaraa 16 april se lekar 30 april tak
 This time, the implementation of the Odd Even scheme can prove to be a litmus test for the government as it did not help in reducing pollution through this scheme both times before
 india today kii data intelegence unit (DIU) ne central polyushan control board (CPCB) ke aankadon kaa vishleshan kiya
 We found that there was no help in reducing the level of pollution in the air through the odd-even scheme in Delhi
 vaahan akele kaarak nahin hankendriya pradooshan niyantra board (CPCB) do baar lagu hui od-ivan skim ke aankadon ko sankalit kiya he
 The report quoted a study by IIT Kanpur as saying that four-wheelers like cars contribute 10 percent of the total carbon emissions that PM2 in the air
 0 or piem 10 badhaate hai
 Theoretically, reducing the number of cars on the roads should reduce the number of PM particles in the air and reduce the dust and other polluting particles flying off the roads
 janvari main report ke aankade kehete hai ki is baat ke koi spasht sanket nahin dekhe gaye hai ki saghanta main koi kami ai ho
 Meteorological conditions, along with other sources of pollution outside the city, had majorly damaged Delhi's air quality

 DIU found in some data analysis that air quality in many places was better even when the odd-even scheme was not implemented

 is parivaar kii badi beti he bilakis urf bobi
 Bobby wants to be a detective
 magar tamaam sthapit detective agency usase footne ko kahati hai kyonki uske paas degree or prafational tameez nahin
 In such a situation, Bobby keeps his passion alive by spying on the muggle level
 isamen uske do dost kam helper cafe oner shetty or waiter ali madad karte hai
 Bobby's customer also has a neighbor's aunt and Tasavvur, a TV anchor
 baad main yahi tasawwur bobi kaa dost bhi ban jaataa he
 Well, this is not the issue
 masalaa ye he ki bhare puure parivaar se ai bobi ke baap ko uskaa yun din raat dolana pasand nahin
 Abbu does not talk to the elder daughter and Ammi keeps him in the eye
 phir aata he bobi kaa bada brake
 a long car stops, Seth with a heavy voice, and gives him a job
 ek ladki ko khojane kaa
 This process of discovery goes on and Bobby starts to become rich
 magar phir ek hakeekat jaanakar uske pairon tale kii jameen khisak jaati he
 In the midst of all this, the activities of street goon Lala and the confusion of Tasavvur are also going on
 bobi jasoos sirf cese hi nahin apni life ke bhi kuch pajals aakhri main solve kar leti he or sab thik ho jaataa he
 Like an allegedly good Hindi film
 film kii kahani main kuch chijen nai taaji hai
 Such as portraying the character of a lady detective without being loud and bloated
 bobi hamaare gali muhalle kii hi ek ladki lagati he
 She neither eats carrots nor offers pillowcase
 bharpoor normal lagati he
 Apart from Bobby, the city Hyderabad has also come out in domestic and interior style
 lekin second half main jasusi cese ke alaava jindagi ke tamaam pech kholane ke pher main kahani ulajh jaati he
 Writers and directors slow to merge everything

 or yaheen par film kuch maat khaati najar aati he
 Vidya Balan's acting in the film is in line with her stature and fame
 unki or ali faijal kii jodi fresh or kute lagi he
 Ali Faizal is also good marks because it is a job to share the frame with Vidya Balan and not to get raw
 film ke baaki kirdaaron kaa chayan samajhadaari ke saath hua he
 Many actors like Rajendra Gupta, Supriya Pathak Shah, Zarina Wahab appeared in the film and showed a lot of passion in their roles
 diarector samar shaikh ne apni pehali film main kai acchhee chijen kii hai
 But it would have been better if he had worked at the speed of the story and avoided the songs due to the current beakings
 film kaa plus point hai nae kism kii theme, vidya kii acting or ali ke saath unki peyaring
 Minus point is some sluggish and stretched second half and there is a chorus of songs in it
 to bobi jasoos he fifty fifty maamla
 Ever since the craze of Destiny's wadding in Bollywood, people have started adopting different ideas to make their wedding day even more memorable

 jab ke parivaar ke mukhiya ke paas apane parivaar ko khilaane ke liye zyada kuch nahin ho or bhavishya bhi andhakaarmay dikhne lage tab vah kya karegaa
 
 
 'take care of the children' ('pillilu payyilam' in Telugu) These are the words Kanakaiah last said by calling his house
 
 
 yah bhi sidhe apane khet se
 
 
 Kanakaiah often stayed at his fields at night
 do acre kii kheti se use kaaphi lagaav tha, lekin bijli or pani kii lagaataar aankh micholi ne use haraa diya
 He did not speak to the family again after that call
 kisi kharaab ashanka se jab uski patni kanakamma kuch logon ke saath daude-daude apane kheton par pahunchi to vahaan par uske pati kii laash imali ke ped se latakati mili
 Kanakaiah's four borewells had failed, all of which was borne by this 32-year-old farmer
 
 
 teen bhainson kii maut ho gai kyonki vah unhen chaara nahin de paa rahaa tha
 He also failed to sell them
 desh ke is bhubhag main pichley teen saalon se lagaataar sookhaa padane ke vajah se kisaan buree tarah prabhavit hai
 When Kanakaiah did not have a system to feed his two sons, he found other ways but could not succeed
 patni kanakamma kaa kahana he ki pati kaa bacchon se kaaphi lagaav tha or usne parivaar kaa hameshaa puraa khyaal rakhaa tha
 The last money of the farmer's family was also spent due to the drought
 halaat itane badtar the ki kanakaiya ke antim sanskaar ke liye bhi paisa nahin bachaa tha
 Kanakamma said crying that the society and the people of the village collected money and performed the last rites
 ghar par ek bhi paisa nahin tha or maatr 40 rupee kanakaiya kii shart se mili jo usne marate vakt pahani thi
 Kanakaiah's grandmother told NDTV that we have not seen this kind of drought in my entire life
 teen saal se lagaataar aisa sookhaa padaa he ki gaanv ke sabhi kuen suukh gaye hai
 There is no water anywhere
 halaat aise hai ki gaanv main manaregaa kaa kaam bhi nahin he
 If there was water in the village, my grandson would not have to commit suicide
 gaanv ke halaat kuch aise hai ki aasapaas ke sabhi khet bhi sookhe pade hai or gaanv main koi bhi mazdooron ko kaam par nahin le rahaa he
 Kanakamma's concern is what she will do now, how she will raise her children
 philhal parivaar ke paas jo kuch khaane ke liye bachaa he vah gaanv ke logon ne kanakaiya ke kriyakram ke baad ke kuch sanskaron ke liye diya tha
 Kanakamma's condition is such that at the age of 30, she feels the need to shawl in a temperature of 43 degrees
 vah bahut kamjor he
 The Telangana government has announced a compensation of five lakh rupees on the suicide of every farmer
 kanakamma kaa kahana he ki abhi tak uske paas sarkaar kii ore se koi nahin aayaa he jo uske pati kii maut ko darj kare
 It is legally necessary if one is to be compensated
 tippaniyan Social worker Kondal Reddy told that till the revenue department officials do not record this death, the farmer's family will not get anything
 yahi vajah he ki sarkaar ke aankade or police ke kisaan ke aatmahatya ke aankadon main itnaa fark hota he
 This is the reason why people have to fight for the rights for the farmers
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki teen saal pehle jab telugana rajya kaa gathan hua tha tab se ab tak 2100 kisaan aatmahatya kar chuke hai or ab tak keval 300 kisaanon ko hi muaavja diya gaya he
 Today Kanakamma's miserable condition is saying this, she says that we are dependent on others for mercy too
 kanakaiya akasar raat main apane kheton par ruk jaataa tha
 He was very fond of farming of two acres, but Micholi, a constant eye for electricity and water, defeated him
 us phone ke baad usne parivaar se dobaaraa baat nahin kii
 When his wife Kanakamma rushed to his fields with some people, due to some bad apprehension, her husband's body was found hanging from the tamarind tree there
 kanakaiya ke chaar borwell fail ho chuke the, sabhi kaa kharchaa is 32 varshiya kisaan ne karje se uthaaya
 
 
 Three buffaloes died because they were unable to feed them
 unhen vah bechney main bhi naakaam rahaa
 Due to continuous drought in this part of the country for the last three years, farmers are badly affected
 jab kanakaiya ke paas apane do beton ko khaanaa khilaane kii vyavastha nahin hui tab usne duusare raste bhi talaashe magar kaamyaab nahin ho paaya
 Wife Kanakamma says that the husband was very fond of children and he always took care of the family
 sookhe kii vajah se kisaan ke parivaar kaa aakhri paisa bhi kharch ho chukaa tha
 The situation was so bad that there was no money left for Kanakaiah's funeral
 kanakamma ne rote hue bataaya ki samaaj ke or gaanv ke logon ne paisa ekatra kar antim sanskaar karaayaa
 There was not a single penny at home and only 40 rupees was found from Kanakaiah's shirt which he wore while dying
 kanakaiya kii daadi ne enditivi se bataaya ki apni puri jindagi main is prakaar kaa sookhaa hamane nahin dekha
 For three years there has been such a drought that all the wells in the village have dried up
 kahin bhi pani nahin he
 The situation is such that there is no work of MNREGA in the village
 gaanv main agar pani hota to mere pote ko aatmahatya nahin kerani padati
 The situation in the village is such that all the surrounding fields are also dry and no one is taking laborers in the village
 kanakamma kii chintaa yah he ki ab vah kya kaam karegi, kaise apane bacchon ko paalegi
 At present, what is left of the family to eat was given by the people of the village for some of the rituals after Kanakaiah's function
 kanakamma kii haalat kuch is tarah ki 30 varsh kii aayu main 43 degree ke taapmaana main use shawl kii jarurat mahasoos ho rahi he
 He is very weak
 telugana sarkaar ne har kisaan kii aatmahatya par paanch lakh rupee ke muaavje kaa elaan kiya he
 Kanakamma says that so far no one has come from the government to record the death of her husband
 yah kanoonee rup se jaruri he agar kisi ko muaavja diya janaa he
 The comments saamaajik kaaryakarta pondal reddy ne bataaya ki rajasav vibhaag ke adhikari jab tak is maut ko darj nahin karenge kisaan ke parivaar ko kuch nahin milegaa
 This is the reason why there is such a difference between the statistics of government and the statistics of farmer suicides of the police
 yahi vajah he ki kisaanon ke liye haq ke liye logon ko ladanaa padataa he
 It is being told that since the formation of Telangana state three years ago, 2100 farmers have committed suicide and till now only 300 farmers have been compensated
 aaj kanakamma kii dayaneey sthiti yahi kah rahi he, vah kahati he ki dayaa ke liye bhi hamen dusron par nirbhar hai

 kahin bhi pani nahin he
 The situation is such that there is no work of MNREGA in the village
 gaanv main agar pani hota to mere pote ko aatmahatya nahin kerani padati
 The situation in the village is such that all the surrounding fields are also dry and no one is taking laborers in the village
 kanakamma kii chintaa yah he ki ab vah kya kaam karegi, kaise apane bacchon ko paalegi
 At present, what is left of the family to eat was given by the people of the village for some of the rituals after Kanakaiah's function
 kanakamma kii haalat kuch is tarah ki 30 varsh kii aayu main 43 degree ke taapmaana main use shawl kii jarurat mahasoos ho rahi he
 He is very weak
 telugana sarkaar ne har kisaan kii aatmahatya par paanch lakh rupee ke muaavje kaa elaan kiya he
 Kanakamma says that so far no one has come from the government to record the death of her husband
 yah kanoonee rup se jaruri he agar kisi ko muaavja diya janaa he
 The comments saamaajik kaaryakarta pondal reddy ne bataaya ki rajasav vibhaag ke adhikari jab tak is maut ko darj nahin karenge kisaan ke parivaar ko kuch nahin milegaa
 This is the reason why there is such a difference between the statistics of government and the statistics of farmer suicides of the police
 yahi vajah he ki kisaanon ke liye haq ke liye logon ko ladanaa padataa he
 It is being told that since the formation of Telangana state three years ago, 2100 farmers have committed suicide and till now only 300 farmers have been compensated
 aaj kanakamma kii dayaneey sthiti yahi kah rahi he, vah kahati he ki dayaa ke liye bhi hamen dusron par nirbhar hai

 Social worker Kondal Reddy told that till the revenue department officials do not record this death, the farmer's family will not get anything
 yahi vajah he ki sarkaar ke aankade or police ke kisaan ke aatmahatya ke aankadon main itnaa fark hota he
 This is the reason why people have to fight for the rights for the farmers
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki teen saal pehle jab telugana rajya kaa gathan hua tha tab se ab tak 2100 kisaan aatmahatya kar chuke hai or ab tak keval 300 kisaanon ko hi muaavja diya gaya he
 Today Kanakamma's miserable condition is saying this, she says that we are dependent on others for mercy too

 shahar ke paas sthit cameri gaanv main ek nirmaanadhin girijaghar main kuch logon ne todphod kii or cross kii jagah bhagwaan hanuman kii murti rakh di
 There has been tension in the area since this incident
 welivarsh girijaghar ke fadar subhash chand ne 9 logon ke khilaaf shikaayat darj karai he, jiske baad police ne ipisi kii dhara 147 (dange ke liye sajaa), 153 e (samoohon ke bich shatruta ko badhaava dena), 295 (puja ghar ko kisi bhi varg kii dharmik bhaavana ko bhadakaane ke uddeshy), 380 (bhawan main chori), 506 (aapraadhik dhamkee) ke tahat maamla darj kiya he
 The complainant said that the accused broke the cross and replaced it with a flag bearing the idol of Lord Hanuman and the image of Lord Rama and threatened to kill him
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki nirmaanadhin upasna sthal se ve ek cooler or kuch duusare saamaan bhi chura le gaye
 Hisar Range Deputy Inspector General of Police Saurabh Singh said that the situation is under control
 baharhaal chrishchiyan front haryana ne ghatana kii ninda kii or aropiyon kii giraftaar kii maang kii jo cameri gaanv ke rahane vaale hai
 The poetry of Kumar Vishwas needs no commentary
 vah ek sugam lay kii tarah man main utar jaati he
 Maghai dissolves in the throat like a pan
 vah lakhon karodon janata ko kavita main sanskaarit karti he
 She teaches listening and humming poetry
 vah saadhaaran kavita or asaadhaaran kavita ke bich kaa fliover he
 Kumar Vishwas is a special face
 vahsahitya ajtakake manch par iske shuruaati saal main bhi the, or is saal bhi honge
 Not only this, the release of the recently published collection of Kumar Vishwas 'phir Meri Yaad' will also be on the stage of Aaj Tak 2019
 is sangrah par charchit aalochak dow om nishchal ne yah samiksha khaastaur sesahitya ajtakake liye likhi he
 Ardhashti passed away while tasting the poetry
 us gaanv ke kasbe main yadi koi adhyaaapak gopiyon ke virah varnan ko yun na samajhaata ki sur kii gopiyaan to bechaari middle paas hai, bahut bhavuk, bahut samvedansheel, rishton kii kadra karne vaali, apane priy par mar mitane vaali or virah main aansu bahaane vaali par ratnakar kii gopiyaan graduate hai
 She neither cries nor cries, she not only loves Krishna but also considers her authority over him, then who is the lord of Mai who stops them from doing so
 unki path baadha bane
 Lakh Uddhav came up with a lot of explained tricks that came with his agenda but forget that the graduate gopis rescued the six of his logic and also instructed him to slip away from the silent street
 nishi din barasat nain hamaare or chup raho udho sudho path mathura ko gaho
 
 
 This difference between who ever explained to our inter teacher did not go to mind till today
 kavita ke udgam kaa strot yahi he ki koi kavita kaa marm samajha de, us bhav dhara main utaar de jisamen vah khud dub kar bah rahaa he
 This is what poetry does
 vah hamaare bheetar ke sote hue taron ko jagaati he, uskaa ras lenaa sikhaati he, virah main ksht main doobana sikhaati he or kutark ke aage apane tark ke saath rahanaa or jeena sikhaati he
 Reading the songs of Pant, Prasad, Mahadevi, Neeraj, Bachchan, Kshem, Bharatbhushan, Roop Narayan Tripathi, Ramavatar Tyagi, Shambhunath Singh in childhood, how deep it is to get into poetry
 vah kavita kaa swarnyug tha
 There was a golden age of verses that have almost departed
 aaj ke babkehair geeton main vah damakham nahin he ki vah dil kii veena ko vaisaa zankrut kar den jaise ramanath avasthi, narendra sharma or som thakur ke geet kiya karte the
 The songs of Thakur Prasad Singh, Ramesh Ranjak and Umakant Malviya have done the same thing in the new songs
 aaj kumaar vishwaas kii kavita yahi karti dikhti he
 She teaches new teenagers how to juice in poetry, teaching in song
 vah prem karnaa sikhaati he
 She teaches the way of expression and teaches Kavita the sound of speech delivery
 unki kavita gambhir kavita tak pahunchane kaa pul banaati he, vah saadhaaran kavita or asaadhaaran kavita ke bich kaa fliover he
 Often, many things are said about Kumar's faith and his poetry
 log naak bhun sikodate hai ki unhone kavita kaa str gira diya he
 i say that he has reputed the verses in the poem and has taught people to live their joyous sorrows by singing and being a part of their memoir
 unhone ramavatar tyaagi jaise kaviyon ke puraane chhandon ko 'koi divaana kahata he' jaise padon main piroyaa or apni tarah gaakar vaisaa hi gane waalon kii qatari khadi kar di
 It is the transition of his songs and singing that in every household that he has ever heard, the tune of his song posts goes home in someone's heart
 sahitya ajtakake manch par unhone yahi kiya he
 He has been doing this in his much talked about 'KV Sammelan' on the platform of the most prestigious and popular channel of the country till date
 rahi baat stariyata kii to kehane kii baat nahin ki jis desh kii jabaan hindi ho, itani samrudh boliyaan or bhashaaen iske khajaane main hon, vahaan hindi kii yah bekadari he ki ise padhane waalon ko rojgaar nahi he, hindi main lakhon bachche fail hote hai
 How will serious poetry reach in such a situation? pehle to vah kalejon vishvavidhyalay ke adhyapakon kii jatil samaj kii jataaon main hi ulajh kar rah jaaegi, vah bacchon tak pahunch hi na paaegi kyonki bacchon ko kavita kaa sanskaar dene vaale adhyaaapak bahut kam rah gaye hai
 At one time, such teachers ridiculed the new poem as rubber verses, but today they are cursed to teach it, they cannot sing nor can recite the poem properly
 ve kavita main dub nahi sakate na doobana or ras lenaa sikhaa sakate hai
 In such a situation, Kumar Vishwas's poetry and his stage are a vibrant workshop of poetry
 maine kolkata main rah kar dekha he ki kavi sammelan sunne waalon main agrani pankti main vagarth ke sampadak or hamaare samay ke shreshth aalochak prabhakar shrotriy patni jyoti shrotriy ke saath baithe dikh jate the, isliye nahin ki ve sammelni kaviyon ke prashansak the par ve unki us bhoomika ko sweekaar karte the ki aise kaviyon ne kavita kii vaachik parampara ko jivit rakhaa he
 a bridge is formed between the verses and the poem
 desh bhar ke manchon par, ram katha se lekar sahitya kii katha,sahitya ajatakamen unki lagaataar upasthiti isiilie he
 Kumar spent over two-and-a-half decades reciting faith and gathering on stage
 apane adhyaaapak banane kii kahani ve khud hi sunaate hai ki kaise pita ke sakht anushaasan ke panje se chhot kar ve kavita kii duniya main pahunche or aaj yahaan logon ke bich hai nahin to pita ke bataae maarg par chalate to ab tak kahin kal purje jodne vaale ejeeniyar bane hote
 Kumar's poetry connects people
 kumaar ne chand kii sadhana kii he
 Has taken the tradition of Prasad, Mahadevi, Nirala etc
 bharatbhushan niraj som thakur rang urmilesh ko saraahaa he
 This is reflected in his songs and verses
 raajakmal prakaashan se abhi-abhi aae unke nae sangrah 'phir meri yaad' ke keval do maah main teen sanskaran ho chuke hai
 While the formal release of this book is proposed on the platform of literature Aaj Tak
 geet, muktak or kavita ke is mili jule sangrah main pichley sangrah ke baad kii kumaar kii ve sari rachanaaen sangrahit hai jo ve aksar manch par gaate gunagunaate rahete hai
 Not surprisingly, he himself says, "for those who live it is essential only to live, cannot say of them, but for people like us inconsistent with the regular rhythm of the era, every breath is a curious divine reminder
 taaliyon, shaalon-dushaalon or aah vaah ke is niyamitshor ke baahar khadaa hua main khud ko aksar skool kii aakhri ghanti kaa intjaar karte paata hum, jaise lakdi kii tikt main bandhi murda pital par pehali thap padate hi pairon ko pankh banaakar ud chaluungaa
 
 
 
 kahaan kis ore
 
 
 Don't really know ''kumaar vishwaas ne apane jivan ko gaan main dhaal liya he
 Have learned to hum every moment of happiness and sorrow
 ve jab raajnneeti ke manch par nahi aae the to geet likhaa karte the, pad likhaa karte the, unamem akulata hoti thi, hiy kii pir hoti thi
 When you come on the stage of politics, the tone of politics also rose in the notes
 satta parivartan ke geet bhi likhe
 When the power was a share, then returned to even
 satta se do chaar hue or siyasat kii asli aukaat or bhitari nirmam cheharaa dekha to tamtamaae bhi
 His shadow also fell on his songs Muktan
 praaia: har kavi swabhaav se hi deshpremi hota he
 This feeling is also in the nature of Kumar, though he may have found that everyone has their own agenda to say Bharat Mata ki Jai
 siyasat main to har ek kii bharat maa bhi jaise uski apni hai
 He looks so anxious to save the shame of Mother India, as if it is only to save the shame of a mother who is ashamed of being degraded
 aise satahi bharat mata kii jai ke kores main kavi kaa man har vakt siyasati nahin ho saktaa he
 He is sad, upset
 aise ahsaas or khinnata ke geet or muktak bhi kumaar ne rache hai
 a song behind him became very popular: Ganga on lips, tricolor in hands
 daulat na ata karnaa maulashohrat na ata karnaa maulabus itnaa ata karnaa maulashmma e vatan kii lau par jab kurbaan patanga ho
 Ganges on lips, tricolor in hands
 kumaar kaa yah teesraa sangrah he jo jaahir he unki lokapriyata ke maddenjar laayaa gaya he
 But Kumar has not been much different from the leaks, mood and feel of his songs
 un par shringaar ke kavi hone kaa jo label laga he vah abhi tak kaayam he
 Sometimes he splashes at politics, but he does not want to be a poet of deep political understanding
 par haa siyasat main ve baagi hokar bhi kavi sammelnon ke centre main pratishthit hai
 His fierce friend is following
 unke twit par retweats kii barasaatein hoti hai
 There are discussions on what he said yesterday, what he said today
 ve khabaron kii lead banati hai
 But the power and politics between which the poet's face was buried for a few days, he has now returned again with the whole poet-self-respect
 ek geet main vah kahata he:kuch kehete hai, main siikhaa hum apane jakhmon ko khud si karkuch jaan gaye, main hansata hum bheetar bheetar aansu pi karkuch kehete hai, main hum virodh se upji ek khuddar vijayakuch kehete hai, main rachataa hum khud main mar kar khud main ji karlekin main har chaturaai kii sochi samajhi naadaani humlav kush kii pir, bina gaai sita kii ram kahani hum
 The verse is Dehri's first accomplishment of the poem but it is not the second most
 hamaari sari kavi parampara praaia: chhandon se hi rachi basii he
 Those who are not proved in the metrical verses also speak of internal rhythm
 nai kavita ke vaicharik vinyas main aise kaviyon kaa ek bada sampradaay he
 He is creating the Veda of poetry which needs commentary
 kumaar kii kavita ko kisi bhashya kii jarurat nahin he
 It enters the mind like a smooth rhythm
 maghai paan kii tarah kanth main ghul jaati he
 She propagates poetry to millions of people
 vah kavita sunanaa or gunana sikhaati he
 How can this Kaul agreement be forgotten? You may not be lost or found in politics, you may not be missing or lost on the conditions of the land, do not let me get buried deep in the conspiracy, but i am the seed of fertility and cannot be moved to the soil
 is sangrah main unki 'teri yaad aati he', 'chup rah nahin sakate', 'tumko suchit ho' jaisi muktakon kii siries bhi he jo ve aksar sunaate rahete hai
 This is the same perplexity of the poet who calls them: i sell some dreams to buy a few breaths
 bas thodaa-sa sustaae the batch kar duniyaadaari seek purana khwab mila he ankhon kii almaari se
 In this collection of songs, poetry, muktak, qata and azad ashar, all the postures of Kumar Vishwas are present
 ve kavita main us khote hue rasayan ko phir se jivit karne kii kavayad main jute hai jo dinodin hamaari jindagi or kavita se gaayab hota ja rahaa he
 They continue to shake the rhythm of politics with their own verses, not in politics
 ve kavi hai yaa nahin, is bahes main pade bina yah kahana chaahunga ki zaraa-si kavita kii ek chhuvan se kumaar vishwaas jaisaa shaks paidaa ho saktaa he jo sadiyon kii hamaari kavi parampara kaa anugayak he
 It should not be in the center of the poem; Today he is sitting on the crown of the hearts of millions of people, for whom it would be impossible to say this post of brother Ehtram Islam - the story of the heady weather is old or the color of the sky is no more, now the crown of hearts is on my head now the throne
 There should be no more capital

 dilli ke uparajyapal najeeb jang ne shuukravaar shaam ko dilli vakf board ko bhang kar diya jiske jawaab main shanivaar ko aam aadmi party ne alji par jamkar nishaanaa saadhaa
 AAP has accused LG of acting at the behest of RSS and Congress
 shuukravaar shaam ko alji najeeb jang ne kejariwal sarkaar kii ore se gathitadilli vakf board ko bhang kar diyaor uske upar karpshan ke aaropon kii jaanch ke liye maamla sibiai ko saunp diya
 But the very next day, the Aam Aadmi Party retaliated and questioned the functioning of LG Nadib Jung in the whole matter
 AAP ne aarope lagaaya ki alji congress or aresas ke kehane par kaam kar rahe hai
 Amanatullah Khan, former chairman of the board, is now talking about taking the court's stand in the matter
 aam aadmi party ne shanivaar ko press conference kar alji par kai aarope lagaae
 Amanatullah Khan alleged that Lieutenant Governor Najeeb Jung has proved that by locking the office of Delhi Waqf Board, LG Sahab is working to protect those who have occupied the land of Waqf Board and maintain shopping malls and hotels on it
 Huh
 AAP ne aarope lagaaya ki vakf board kii lagbhag 1100 bigha jameen par avaidh kabja he or jab isaki shikaayat alji se kii gai to unhone ulta vakf board par taala dalava diya or maamla sibiai main de diya
 The AAP alleged that Najeeb Jung is acting at the behest of the Bharatiya Janata Party, RSS and Congress as the bjp-congress are found in the monkey bond of Waqf Board lands
 is maamle main jab congress se baat kii gai to dipisisi president ajay maakan ne aam aadmi party ko aade haathon liya or kaha ki wo to do saal puraani party he jabaki congress 60 saalon aresas se lard rahi he
 Amanatullah Khan said on Saturday that he will approach the court in this matter, but looking at the latest circumstances, it seems that after this case, there will be a confrontation between the Center and the Delhi government once again
