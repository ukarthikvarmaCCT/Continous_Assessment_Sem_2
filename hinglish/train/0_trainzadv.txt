 Economic statistics can confuse the ruling classes anywhere around the world, but what is different in the case of present-day India is that the ruling class here seems to be bent on suppressing such figures

 Samajwadi Party patron Mulayam Singh Yadav today held a press conference at Lohia Trust, which did not include Shivpal Yadav
 mana ja rahaa tha ki mulaayam singh koi bada raajnneetik faisla lenge, par netaji ne saare kayaason par pani pher diya
 In such a situation, Shivpal Yadav has now decided to go for a press conference himself
 shivpal ne pehle do baje press conference bulaai thi, lekin ab use radd kar diya gaya he
 It is believed that Shivpal will take the decision that Mulayam Singh could not take
 shivpal yadav or akhilesh yadav ke bich pichley ek saal se shah-maat kaa khel chal rahaa he
 Akhilesh Yadav has lined up the Samajwadi Party after the assembly elections
 itnaa hi nahin shivpal ke karibiyon ko bhi party se hataa diya he
 Shivpal Yadav was trying to beat Akhilesh politically with Mulayam, but Netaji did not take any step against Akhilesh
 lohia trustmen somvaar ko netaji ne press conference kii
 It was believed that he would take a big decision
 itnaa hi nahin vah alag party banane kaa bhi kadam uthaa sakate hai
 When Netaji got down to press conference, all the speculations were blown out
 unhone yogi sarkaar par hamale kiye or phir samaajawaadee party ko majboot karne ke liye logon se apil kii
 Here Mulayam Singh flatly refused to form a separate party
 shivpal ab lagata he ki khud apni ladaai ladane utar rahe hai
 With this in view, he decided to hold a press conference
 aise main maan ja rahaa he ki shivpal patrakaron ke saamne koi bada faisla khud lenge
 Aam Aadmi Party is in political turmoil these days
 dhire-dhire party main maahaul kumaar vishwaas barakes arvind kejariwal banataa ja rahaa he
 Recently the party had a big meeting at Ramlila Maidan in Delhi, in which Arvind Kejriwal appealed to vote to defeat the BJP in the Gujarat elections
 is masale par aap netaa kumaar vishwaas ne aaj tak ke saath khaas baatcheet karte hue kaha ki main spsht kar duun ki hamaare yahaan saare raajnneetik nirnay PAC main hote hai, PAC main gujarat chunaav main kise vot den isapar nirnay nahin hua he, PAC hui hi nahin he
 According to Kumar Vishwas, 'nothing like this has been decided, Arvind is a private entity in itself
 arvind ke nijee vichaar se sahamat-asahmat hona hamaara adhikaar he
 What Arvind said in Ramlila Maidan was personal opinion that the other party is definitely voting for the other party, it is definitely the Congress, i ask any appeal in Gujarat, although who is asking us, but i am of the opinion that Joop in Gujarat The candidates are contesting without help
 unhen vot dijie, or jahaan aam aadmi party nahi hai vahaan NOTA ko vot dijie
 We have not won BJP or Congress in politics
 kumaar ne aage kaha, 'arvind kii niztaa par main sawaal nahi uthaa rahaa, wo sidhe aae or bol diya
 But let me say clearly this is not the decision of the party
 kai kaaryakarta arvind kii is baat se asahaj hue, kai mujhase puch rahe hai ki arvind ke is bayaan par kya kaha jaae
 i say suppress NOTA in Gujarat
 achche nirdaleey ko vot de denamgar bijepi yaa congress ko vot mat dena
 On the issue of getting older people to join the party, Kumar said, 'when we had gone, Ramlila was on a high platform in the field, now we have come down
 ham 5 lakh kursi se 5 hajaar kursi par aa gaye hai
 In the middle, some colleagues have left, which is not a good thing, my appeal to the workers is touching, since then hundreds of thousands of old workers are coming to meet me
 kai log punjab main dalit up mukhyamantri vaale bayaan se naaraaz ho gaye the
 Thousands of old people are coming back, many are systematically excluded from the party
 magar isse kuch hasil nahin hoga
 We have lost many elections continuously, so we had started the movement, we should return
 lalu yadav ke saath aam aadmi party ke gathbandhan par kumaar vishwaas ne kaha, 'lalu ji 1977 main vanshavaad ke khilaaf lade the aise main wo aaj bete-beti kii raajnneeti main pahunch gaye hai, ye sochna bhi sambhav nahin he ki ham unke saath ladenge
 Kumar Vishwas, an activist of the Anna movement and a founding member of the party, is saying with full responsibility that we will not do any alliance with Lalu ji till i am
 lalu-nitish shapathgrahan main arvind gaye the naa mujhe poocha gaya tha naa bataaya gaya tha wo unka nijee nirnay tha
 Brother, i am not in any position, but there are protocols of the Chief Minister
 'main ye jarur kahuunga ki is desh main sampradayikta or dharmanirpekshata kii nautanki ke naam par satta ke gathbandhan kii chaah isdesh ke netaaon ke khun main he
 When Ram Vilas Paswan has to form a government with the BJP, he comes with non-congressism and when he wants the support of the Congress, he becomes anti-communal
 secularism or conmunlism in do cardon ko khelnaa bekaar he, jo chal dharmanirpekshata shabd par congress or uski saathi party karti hai wo hi chal rashtrawaad naam par bijepi or uski saathi party karti hai
 Apparently, Kumar Vishwas has clearly targeted Arvind Kejriwal and his jury and it somewhere suggests that the atmosphere is going to be Kumar Vishwas vs Arvind Kejriwal in the Aam Aadmi Party in the coming days

 ' Piyush Goyal has been given additional charge of the Finance Ministry just before the budget in place of Arun Jaitley, who is undergoing treatment abroad
 pradhanmantri narendra modi kii salaah par piyush goyal ko yah jimmedaari di gai he
 It is believed that this decision has been taken due to Arun Jaitley's illness

 vitt mantri arun jetali jab kidney transplant ke liye ames main bhartee hue the, tab bhi piyush goyal ko vitt mantralay kaa atirikt prabhaar diya gaya tha
 Arun Jaitley did not even travel abroad in the last 9 months due to illness

 Jaitley has also undergone heart surgery

 It was then believed that he had recovered
 haal hi main saamaanya varg ko das pratishat aarakshan ke mudde par sansad main hui bahes main unhone behad prabhaavshaalee bhaashan diya tha
 Seeing his style, he seemed to have recovered completely
 lekin beete ravivaar kii raat hi achaanak ve ilaaj ke liye america ravaanaa ho gaye
 Not only Jaitley in the BJP, Goa Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar is also suffering from a serious illness
 haal hi main bijepi adhyaksh amit shah bhi swine flu ke shikaar ho gaye the
 Due to this, he too had to be admitted to AIIMS

 External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj has also undergone a kidney transplant
 ab ve bhi swasth hokar apana daayitv bakhubi nibhaa rahi hai

 ham musalamaanon ko manaanaa chaahate hai or aaj shiya or kai musalmaan hamaare saath hai
 Today the Muslim community is divided
 'aakhir modi ne khud ko hindu rashtravaadi kyon kaha, is sawaal par subramanyam swami ne kaha- ‘modi se kisi ne ye sawaal poocha tha ki kya aap hindu rashtravaadi hai
 So he said that yes, i am also a Hindu and also a nationalist
 isliye hindu rashtravaadi hum
 Modi made this statement
 ayodhya main ram mandir banavaane sambandhi amit shah ke bayaan par subramanyam swami ne kaha- ‘ram mandir bijepi or endie ke agenda main hameshaa se hi rahaa he
 There is no difference between BJP and NDA
 donon ek hi mat ke hai
 The temple has to be built
 main to kahata hum ki ye hindustan kaa agenda he
 The NDA is only responsible for it
 'ek sawaal ke jawaab main subramanyam swami ne kaha- ‘agar 2014 main narendra modi pradhanmantri bane to bijepi ayodhya main ram mandir banavaayegi
 They will get the temple built according to the law and also celebrate the Muslims
 ’congress kii naakaami ke bajaay ab modi ko lekar dharm nirpekshata or communism kii baaten ho rahi hai, is sawaal par subramanyam swami ne kaha- ‘narendra modi ke bhaashanon main koi mandir kaa zikr nahin he

 With the end of the rally, dust and mud have started to sit on the ground and calm down, but the discussions, controversies and polarization of the post-rally discussions are not calming down
 lekin sabase pehle raily kii baat
 This rally of Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) was the first public meeting of Lalu while out of power and Lalu must have had a strong desire in his mind that this should also be his last meeting while away from power
 is parivartan raily se pehle lalu yadav gandhi maidan main aktubar 2007 main chetavanee raily main najar aae the
 The RJD chief was the railway minister at UPA 1 at the time
 haalanki saal 2009 ke baad ve rail mantri nahin rah sake
 Since then, the situation has changed from bad to worse for the besieged Lalu
 243 sadasyon vaali bihar vidhansabha main argedy ke keval 22 vidhayak hai or maharajaganj se party ke saansad rahe umashankar singh kii maut ke baad loksabhaa main party ke mahaj teen sadsy bache hai
 The Parivartan Rally, which ended on 15 May, both in terms of the number of people attending the meetings and the reaction, cannot be compared to Nitish's Adhikar Yatra on 4 November
 agar nitish kii adhikaar yatra se isaki tulana nahin bhi karen to bhi khud lalu dwaara march 1996 main sambodhit kii gai garib maharaila yaa november 1974 main indira gandhi sarkaar ke khilaaf jai prakaash narayan kii raily se is parivartan raily kii tulana nahin kii ja sakati
 Gandhi Maidan has a capacity of about three lakh people
 agar maidan main khaali padi choti-choti pattiyon ko jod diya jaae to bhi maidan aadha khaali dikhaai de rahaa tha
 It is clear that Parivartan Rally has not been able to attract more people, but it is also true that this was the biggest political event organized by Lalu in the last seven years
 utsaahi bheed or khaskar yuvaaon ne lalu ke endie sarkaar ko ukhaad phenkane ke elaan ke jawaab main badi sankhya main chilchilaati dhoop kaa saamana karte hue bhagidaari kii
 This shows that he still does not have confidence in the RJD chief
 jaisaa ki anumaan tha, lalu ke bhaashan kaa focus nitish sarkaar ko satta se bedakhal karne par tha
 Lalu also gave his reasons for this
 namaji topi pahanakar 16
 Trying to connect himself directly with 53 per cent Muslims, Lalu said, "nitish is benefiting communal forces like RSS-BJP
" ve ek behad bhrasht sarkaar ke mukhiya hai
 Lalu said, "arrests of Muslim youth from across Bihar on the pretext of joining terrorism" and Nitish turned his back on the whole case
 ” nishchit taur par lalu ko yah ummid he ki sarkaar par aisa aarope lagaakar vah abhedya maane jane vaale muslim-yadav (esavai) sameekaran ko phir se golband kar sakate hai
 However this is only half true
 kendriya khufia agenciyon ne kathith aatanki ghatnaon main shaamil hone ke chalate bihar or desh ke alag-alag hisson se muslim naujavaanon ko giraftaar kiya he
 He has taken this step under the supervision of UPA-2, which is still supported by Lalu Yadav
 rajya ke sarkari mahakamon main vyaapt bhrashtachar or uske khilaaf logon ke man main bad rahe asantosh or kam vetan ke chalate sanvida par kaam karne vaale shikshakon main bad rahi naaraazgi ko bhunaane kii ummid main lalu ne unki naukariyon ko niyamit karne kaa vaada kiya
 While Lalu left no room for doubt on his talk, he did not deliberately give any revelation and indication about his plan to oust Nitish Kumar from power and make his return to the state's political arena
 yah baat sabhi jaanate the ki lalu kii parivartan raily kaa doosraa sabase bada paksh unke donon beton-tejasvi or tejpratap ke raajnneeti main pravesh kii aupchaarik ghoshnaa tha
 Lalu was also seen trying to justify his two sons' entry into politics
 unhone behad tathyaatmak hokar sawaal kiya, ''ye mere ladke hai
 So they are picking up lanterns
 inhen or kya karnaa chahie? kya ye sampradayik bhaajapa kaa camel tham len yaa phir nitish kumaar kaa tir?” bhai-bhatijawad ke aaropon par rakshaatmak hote hue lalu ne argedy ke netaaon ko argedy parivaar kaa hissaa bataaya
 But Lalu's reply cannot calm the whispers going on in the political circles
 patna kaa gandhi maidan darasal lalu putron kaa laanching pad bana he or vanshavaad kii raajnneeti main ek or adhyay jud gaya he
 Lalu also promised to give fifty percent tickets to the youth and women in the assembly elections from the stage
 is ghoshnaa par par unki jai-jayakaar hui lekin shaayad yahi vah vakt he jab argedy pramukh ko isi jagah se chah saal pehle kiye gaye apane vaade kii yaad dilaane kii jarurat he
 While addressing a warning meeting in 2007, he promised that if the RJD came to power in Bihar, he would implement 10 per cent reservation for the upper caste poor
 haalanki bihar kii janata ne 2009 ke lok sabha chunaav or 2010 ke vidhansabha chunaav main argedy ko khaarij kar diya or is bich lalu apane puraane vaade bhul gaye
 They do not even discuss these promises anymore
 aakhir ab vakt nae vaade karne kaa jo he
 Lalu showed that not only is he still having his own strength, but he is also a full-bodied man of the same spirit
 lekin sach yah bhi he ki unke is bejod andaaj or haav-bhav kii chamak lagaataar feeki pad rahi he or yah matdaan ke din unhen vot dilava paane main safal nahin ho paa rahaa he
 His snooty words are still liked today, but it is certain that the people listening to him with laughter are not voting for him
 vaise lalu ke is shakti pradarshan ko nitish sarkaar se bihar kii janata ke mohabhang kaa nateeja mana ja rahaa he
 Obviously, this cannot be considered the result of a sudden surge in Lalu's popularity
 itnaa jarur he ki yadav maton kaa unka thos janaadhar majboot hua he
 But will it be enough? Will Lalu be able to convert this disillusionment of people into votes? As the leader of Bihar's main opposition party, Lalu has the capacity to mobilize but does not have the credibility that is needed at the moment
 lalu ne soch-samajhakar apni sabha ko parivartan raily kaa naam diya
 For them, change means changing the government, but perhaps they are forgetting that Bihar has changed a lot in the last few years and with this change they too need to change
 tamaam dalon ke netaaon dwaara ghrinaa failaane vaale bayanon ke bich sandesh dete hue pradhanmantri narendra modi ne guuruuvaar ko sampradayik sauhaard kii vakaalat kii or hinduon tathaa musalamaanon se garibi ke khilaaf milakar kaam karne or netaaon ke ‘gairjimmedaarana’ bayanon ko nazarandaaj karne ke liye kaha
 PM Modi said at a rally in Nawada in Bihar that if he too makes such a statement, then he should ignore it too
 dadri main ikhlaaq naam vyakti kipit-petakar hatya kii ghatana par jari sampradayik dwand ke bich apni chuppi todate hue pradhanmantri ne raashtrapati pranab mukherjee ko uddhrut karte hue kaha ki deshavaasiyon ko vividhta, sahishnutaa or bahulata ke mulyon ke sangrakshan ko lekar kal die gaye unke sandesh kaa paalan karnaa chahie
 The PM said, 'I have said this before
 hinduon ko faisla karnaa chahie kimuslimon se laden yaa garibi se
 Muslims should decide whether to fight Hindus or poverty
 
 The country will benefit when Hindus and Muslims together fight poverty and defeat it
 
 This country will have to remain united
 ’ unhone spasht kiya ki vah nafrat failaane kii raajnneeti ke khilaaf hai
 The Prime Minister said, 'only unity, communal harmony, brotherhood and peace will take the country forward
 ’pradhanmantri ne logon se netaaon ke‘gairjimmedaarana’ bayanon ko nazarandaaj karne kii apil karte hue kaha ki ve aisa raajnneetik hiton ke liye kar rahe hai or iskaa ant hona chahie
 He said, 'I want to tell the countrymen, some small-time leaders are bent on making irresponsible statements for their political interests
 
 Such statements must end
 
 i want to request people that even if Modi makes such a statement, he should not pay attention to such statements
 ’raashtrapati pranab mukherjee mukherjee ke buudhvaar ko die gaye bayanon ke sandarbh main pradhanmantri modi ne deshavaasiyon se kaha, ‘agar aapako dhyaan dena he, to raashtrapati dwaara diye gayi sandesh or dikhaae gaye maarg par dena chahie
 'he said,' Yesterday the President showed the way
 125 karod logon ke desh ke pramukh ne jo bhi kaha usase bada koi sandesh nahin ho saktaa, usase badi koi disha nahin ho sakati, usase badi koi prerana nahin ho sakati
 'PM Modi said that the people of the country should follow the path shown by the President and' only then India can meet the expectations of the world
 ’ raashtrapati ne buudhvaar ko ek kaarykram ko sambodhit karte hue kaha tha, ‘meraa yah drudh vishwaas he ki ham apane samaaj ke buniyadi mulyon ko yun hi vyarth jane kii manjuuri nahin de sakate or ye buniyadi mulya vahi hai jinhen varshon se hamaare samaaj ne vividhta ke rup main buland rakhaa or sahishnutaa, dhary or bahulwaad ko badhaayaa or uski vakaalat kii
 Recalling his speech given last year after the bomb blast at Gandhi Maidan in Patna, Modi said that he had given a message of brotherhood and harmony amid bloodshed
 unhone kaha ki ham is najariye or samskruti ke saath aage bad rahe hai
 Talking about that incident, Modi targeted Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar for doing politics on the issue and mocking his comments due to arrogance without worrying about the people who lost their lives in the blasts
 mahagathbandhan ko ‘mahaswarth gathbandhan’ qaraar dete hue modi ne kaha, yah ‘big baas’ ke ghar kii tarah he jahaan ek ‘big baas’ he jo khud ke kingmekar hone kaa daawa karata he or chahta he ki sabhi uske ishaaron par naachein

 beeti 4 july ko jab britain ne iran ke ek tanker ko sij kiya tha jawaab main usne bhi british oil tanker ko pichley hafte hi pakad liya tha
 At that time tensions between Iran and Western countries had increased

 The Indian team has been performing well on the other hand Korea has failed to make an impact so far and was second in Pool b after Malaysia

 ise aap kah sakate hai ki maine party ke vip kaa ulanghan kiya he
 i am tired of the Center and our TDP government

 However, the Congress seems divided over the timing of this proposal
 sutron se mili jaankaree ke anusaar avishvaas prastaav kii timming ke paksh main congress ke ek dhade kaa maananaa he ki yadi yah modi sarkaar kaa antim sansadeey satr hua to vipaksh is maukey se chook jayega ki sarkaar bina avishvaas prastaav ke kaarykaal puri nahin kar pai
 It believes that it should remain on record that a motion of no confidence came against the current government
 is tark ke peeche manshaa he ki bahes kii media kawarej se modi sarkaar ke khilaaf mudhon ko janata ke bich le jane kaa mauka milegaa
 At the same time, the opposition will gather together
 duusari taraf pradhanmantri narendra modi ko bhi apane sahyogiyon or baaki dalon ko manaane ke liye jaddojahad karnaa padegaa
 Whereas a section of Congress opposing the timing of the motion of faith believes that the opposition has come under the trap of the Modi government
 naam na chhapane kii shart par ek varisht congress netaa ne aaj tak se kaha he ki shuukravaar shaam ko prastaav par voting se pehle pradhanmantri modi apana bhaashan loksabhaa main denge

 kumaar kii upnagareey andheri ilaake main ek mandir ke baahar teen logon ne 12 agast 1997 ko hatya kar di thi
 According to the prosecution, Qayyum was one of the conspirators who attended the meeting in Dubai

 The prosecution said that Salem and absconding accused and music composer Nadeem Saifi were also present in the meeting
 yah baithak faraar mafia sargana daud ibrahim ke bhai anis ibrahim ke daftar main hui thi
 Qayyum was brought to India from Dubai in 2007
 uske khilaaf sajeesh rachane or hatya karne kaa maamla darj kiya gaya tha
 The police had alleged that Kumar was murdered due to business rivalry and Ramesh Taurani, the owner of another cassette company, had given a contract of Rs 25 lakh to Salem for allegedly killing Kumar
 haalanki, police sajeesh vaale pahalu ko sabit nahin kar saki or torani tathaa 17 anya aropiyon ko 2002 main bari kar diya gaya
 Nadeem was in London at the time of Kumar's murder and has not returned to India since then
 bharat sarkaar ne nadeem ke pratyrpan kii maang kii thi lekin britain kii adaalat main maamla haar gai
 Salem is still shown as an absconding accused in the murder case because the extradition treaty with Portugal does not mention that he will be prosecuted in the case

 On 16 May 2014, the results of the current Lok Sabha elections came and for the first time BJP got such a large majority in the country and Narendra Modi became the PM
 modi ne cabinet ke saath 26 may 2014 ko pad or gopniyata kii shapath lee
 The Modi government, which came to power with the appeal of freedom from corruption, rapid development and change, had asked 60 years of time from the country's voters
 vaada kiya tha ki vah congress ke bhrashtachar yukt deveopment model se alag bhrashtachar mukt bharat banane ke liye nitiyon main jaruri badlaav karegi
 Modi government is going to complete 36 months in 60 months
 aise main aankalan jaruri he kibhrashtachar se mukti or tej vikaske agenda par jane ke liye kaarykaal ke is hisse (modi ke 3 saal) tak kitna badal gaya bharat
 It is worth noting that this campaign of change was given by the Modi government to the NITI Aayog, which was set up to replace the Planning Commission
 is niti ayog ko neshnal institute for transforming india (NITI) naam dete hue kendriya cabinet ne 1 janvari 2015 ko sthapit kiya
 To formulate policies for the central government, the NITI Aayog set out three important objectives - Digital India, Cooperative Federalism, bringing women into the mainstream of development, that is, the objective of the NITI Aayog is to create strong states that are interlinked
 Unite and build a strong India

 '1
 digital india- internet par deveopment kaa kheldesh se bhrashtachar kaa khaatmaa karne ke liye kendra sarkaar ne digital india kii disha main bada kadam uthaaya
 With a view to curbing black money and promoting cashless transactions across the country, the Modi government announced the ban on 8 November 2016, prohibiting the most driven currency of 500 and 1000 rupees in the economy
 iske saath hi kendra sarkaar ne cashles arthvyavastha ko badhaava dene ke liye bhim aadhaar placeform laanch kiya jiskaa makasad desh main chote kaarobaariyon ko cashles tranjaction ke liye protsaahit karnaa tha

 haalanki notebandi ke baad desh ke kuch hisson main cash kii killat kaa maamla bhi saamne aayaa or aarthik aankadon main bhi notebandi kaa aanshik asar dekhne ko mila
 But most economists in the country and the world claimed to benefit from demonetisation in the long term

 Cooperative Federalism: The dream of Team India was the effort of the Central Government to build strong states in the country by which a strong India can be built
 iske liye kendra sarkaar ne puure desh ko ek kaaman market banane kii disha main jiesti bill ko paarit karaane main ahm bhoomika nibhaai
 It is worth noting that the Central Government succeeded in building consensus across the country on the GST issue and took the final decision with the activeness of all the states
 ab kendra sarkaar kii koshish july 2017 se ise prabhavi karne kii he jiske liye GST council (sabhi rajyon kii ahm bhoomika) ko mukhya kirdaar ke taur par rakhaa gaya he
 It is now believed that after implementing GST with success, the country's economy will get a chance to grow at a fast pace
 aarthik jaankaron kaa daawa he ki puure desh main jiesti purna rup se prabhavi hone ke baad desh ko dabl disit kii vikaas dar bhi dekhne ko mil sakati he

 mahilaon ko kya mila?kendra sarkaar ne niti ayog ke nirdeshon par beete teen saal ke dauraan kai ahm yojanaon ko shuru kiya jisase deshbhar main mahilaon ko shashakt karne kii disha main ahm kaha ja saktaa he
 The most important of these schemes was to provide LPG under the Ujjwala scheme for clean and safe cooking to women in rural areas by the central government
 vahiin modi sarkaar ne jandhan skim ke tahat mahilaon ko banking kii mukhyadhara se jodne kaa kaam kiya
 At the same time, a draft has been put in front of registration of most houses to be allotted under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana in the name of women

 In such a situation, we have brought 10 questions of current affairs for them

 ) The Congress alleged that the Model Code of Conduct has become the Modi Code of Conduct
 congress ne pradhanmantri narendra modi or bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah dwaara aachaar samhita ke ulalanghanon par chunaav ayog kii chuppi par sawaal uthaate hue kaha ki vah donon ke khilaaf karrwai kii maang ko lekar court kaa darwaja khatkhata sakati he
 Senior Congress leader Abhishek Manu Singhvi alleged that the two leaders have cheated on the issue of equal opportunity for all parties during the elections
 unhone ise lekar nigaraneekarta or chunaav ayog kii chuppi par sawaal uthaaya
 Singhvi told a press conference that we have the right to approach the court, seeking action for violations of the code of conduct
 ham is vikalp kaa istemaal kar sakate hai
 The watchdog has closed its eyes
 singhvi ne kaha ki chuppi ko manjuuri samajha ja saktaa he
 Taking a dig at the Election Commission, he said that the Congress is sad to say that the 'C' has been removed from the Election Commission's second word and has become an 'election Omission' for the modi-shah duo
 unhone sawaal kiya ki kya modi or shah aachaar samhita ke daayre se baahar hai
 He termed the code of conduct as 'modi Code of Conduct'
 singhvi ne daawa kiya ki donon netaaon ne teen shreniyon main aachaar samhita kaa vyapak ulanghan kiya he
 These include polarization of votes, mentioning the armed forces in the campaign and holding rallies on election day
 unhone kaha ki chunaav ayog ne hamaari shikayaton ke aadhaar par kai netaaon ke khilaaf aachaar samhita ulanghan ke liye karrwai kii he
 We appreciate it, but why the same action was not taken against Modi and Shah
 singhvi ne kaha ki hamen yah kehete hue dukh ho rahaa he ki yah chunaav ayog ke adhikaar kshetra kaa sawaal he or adarsh aachaar samhita kaa sawaal he to modi-shah kii jodi ko ek tarah se khuli chhot he
 He said that there are no such people who have closed their eyes on the existence of Election Commission, Code of Conduct and Constitution for their electoral gains
 singhvi ne kaha ki maine chunaav ayog ko teen shreniyon par daleel di thi- nafrat failaane vaale bhaashan, sashastr bal or matdaan ke dauraan prachaar
 Referring to the case of Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, he said that the Election Commission had passed orders on two of these issues and prohibited promotional activities
 ayog ne yogi par 72 ghante tak prachaar karne par roak lagaai thi
 Singhvi further said that for the last 25 days he personally reached out to the Commission, heading at least 15 delegations
 unhone ayog se aagrah kiya ki vah modi or shah ke khilaaf shikayaton par gaur karte samay apane khud ke adeshon or misaalon kaa paalan kare
 The Congress leader said Singhvi that there are two laws in this country, one for the Prime Minister and Amit Shah and the other for others
 unhone kaha ki isliye ab ham chunaav ayog se tab shikaayat kar rahe hai jab pani hamaare sir ke upar bad gaya he
 He said that the people of India demand an answer from the Commission for this inaction, for this silence and through the power we have, we are also trying, and he said that if the need arises, we will go to the court Can knock, but the issue is why the Election Commission is not doing anything
 congress netaa pi si chaako or shatrughna sinha ke yaccin malik or mohammad ali jinna par kathith tippanee ke bare main sawaal par singhvi ne kaha ki sinha ne apni tippanee spasht kar di he or behatar hoga yadi chaako se is mudde par sidhe sampark kiya jaae

 aam chunaav kii tazaa khabaron se apadet rahane ke liesbscrib karenajatak kaa ellection special newzlator The 17-year-old friendship is on the verge of breakdown
 bihar main endie main foot tay ho chuki he bas aupchaarik elaan baaki he
 Both BJP and JDU have agreed that now the roads are separated
 aaj patna main janata dal united netaaon kii dopaher kareeb saadhe 12 baje baithak he or baithak main tay faislon ke bare main party dopaher 3 baje media ko bataaegi
 The parties, which have been running the government for 8 years, will now move forward on their political paths
 bijepi ko modi par bharosa he to nitish ko modi virodh par
 JDU is calling for secularism, the eye is on Muslim voters
 bijepi modi ke naam par itnaa aage bad chuki he ki ab waapas lautnaa mumkin nahin
 This is the reason why the central leadership of both the parties are trying to show themselves forced behind this break up
 gathbandhan tootna lagbhag taydedh dashak se zyada lambii dosti dedh din bhi chal jaae to ganimat he
 The relationship between BJP and JDU has become so bitter that now it seems certain to break up
 modi naam kii aisi pench fansi he ki gathbandhan ise sulajhaa nahin paa rahaa
 The JDU has been repeatedly saying that Modi does not approve of them at all, and now the BJP has also made it clear that it does not tolerate a veto in the name of Modi
 jediu netaa shivanand tiwari ne kaha, 'ab jo seen he usamen andeh kii kahaan gunjaaish he
 The lion that Nitish Kumar read on Friday has become clear
 ravivaar tak koi na koi faisla ho jayega
 On the other hand, BJP leader Nand Kishore Yadav said, 'nerendra Modi ji is a national leader, he will be benefited
 ek dal ke vito ke aadhaar par ham apane netaa kaa apmaan karen ye thik nahin
 JDU knows that even if broken, there is no threat to the government, figures are in favor
 chunaav main bhi dhai saal kaa vakt he
 Nitish is confident that in two-and-a-half years, he will pull the trend of voters across Bihar
 bijepi ko nitish kii isi chaal main dagabaaji kii bu aa rahi he
 JDU leader Sanjay Kumar Singh said, 'as for majority, 118 mlas are with us, and independent mlas have always supported us
 vahiin bijepi ke purv pradesh adhyaksh gopal narayan singh ne kaha, 'ye pehle se hamen pataa tha ki bahut zyada din tak ye gathbandhan chalane vaala nahin he, kyonki nitish ji yuj and thro kii policy apanaate hai, jab unhen lagane laga ki ab hamaara vyaktitv bada ho gaya he to ek saal pehle hi unhen galatfahami ho gayi thi ki ab puraa bihar unki taraf ja rahaa he
 Since then, they started moving away
 rashtriya netritv main bihar ke netaaon jaisi talkhi nahin he
 The JDU president is also hinting at a break up of the relationship, but the scope of negotiations is left
 udhar bijepi bhi kah rahi he ki ham to gathbandhan bachaae rakhana chaahate hai
 Neither will the BJP backtrack in the name of Modi, nor will the JDU be able to compromise on Modi's name
 donon hi apane apane vot bank kii khatir majaboor hai
 In this case, no matter how much the meetings are, whatever the conversation may be, but it seems certain that this friendship will not last
 bijepi ke paas kya hai vikalpek or rajya kii satta haath se khisakati dikhi to bechaini dilli tak machi
 In the hope of power of the Center, Modi was made the charioteer of the election chariot, then 17-year-old colleagues in Bihar lost
 jediu ne jataa diya ki unhen modi katai manjuur nahin
 In such a situation, there are two ways for the BJP
 yaa to wo modi ke mudde par peeche hate or pehle kii tarah bihar main number do party ban kar sarkaar main shaamil rahe
 The second is that he should leave the temptation of power in Bihar for the time being and look at the politics of the center
 abtak kii jo ranneeti he usamen lag to yahi rahaa he ki bijepi ne doosraa rasta akhriyaar karne kaa man banaaya he
 Perhaps this is the reason why BJP is attacking the image of Nitish Kumar, trying to shine his secular image in the opposition of Modi
 party ke netaa puch rahe hai ki gujarat dangon ke dauraan modi ke saath rahane vaale nitish ko ab modi sampradayik kaise najar aa rahe hai?bijepi ke mantriyon ne choda kaamkajabijepi kii bihar ikai se bhi talkhi ke sanket mil rahe hai
 The round of meetings is going on
 susheel kumaar samet kuch mantriyon ne to kaamkaaj abhi se chhod diya he
 The ministers of BJP have also rejected the invitation that Nitish Kumar sent to meet the ministers
 lage haath bijepi ye sandesh bhi de rahi he ki wo nahin chaahati ki gathbandhan toote
 The party claims that this breakdown is not good for the people of Bihar
 bijepi kaa makasad saaf he
 The party does not want him to be held responsible for the split
 taaki wo dhokhaa khaae party kii tarah bihar kii janata ke saamne khud ko pesh kar saken

 justise mukherjee ne aaj tak se kaha, “main khush hum ki jiske liye mere ankal lade or jaan di, wo ab puraa ho gaya he
 There should be uniformity in implementing such law with one law and one administration
 ”unhone aage kaha, “aisa kadam uthaane ke liye bahut himmat chahie, lekin kya ye budhimatta vaala faisla he, yah logon or supreme court ko tay karnaa he

 ) The food found on the rail is not fit for human consumption
 niyantrak evam lekha pareekshak (CAG) kii report main iskaa khulaasa hua he
 The audit report of the CAG on the catering service of the Indian Railways is to be laid in Parliament on Friday
 report main bataaya gaya he ki railway steshnon par jo khaane-pine kii chijen parosi ja rahi hai, wo insaani istemaal ke laayak hi nahin hai
 According to the report, things being served at trains and stations are polluted
 dibbaband or bottleband chizon ko expyri date ke baavjood bechaa ja rahaa he
 In the Duronto Express, rats and cockroaches were seen roaming around in food
 anand vihaar stesan se chhootane vaali ek train main musafir ne order to diya katlet kaa, lekin railway ne muft main lohe kii keelein bhi bhent kar di
 The taste of the railway is even more bitter
 team ne paaya ki ek stesan par anbike or kharaab ho chale parathe phir se musafiron kii seva main hajir kar die
 Wearing gloves and caps for catering staff at railway stations is nothing short of a sin
 kaig report main likhaa he ki khaane ke thekedaar khaane kii quality or saaf safai se samjhauta karte hai
 Even after being found guilty, the Railways does not take any action against them
 sieji ne apni report main yah bhi likhaa he ki theke baantne ke dauraan bhi ghotaalaa kiya gaya
 Even covering the food to keep it from getting dirty, the staff kept their eyes closed
 ab railway ke adhikari ection kii duhai de rahe hai
 It was also found in the investigation that cleanliness is not being taken care of in Kirelway campus and trains
 iske alaava train main bik rahi chizon ke bill na die jane or food quality main kai tarah kii khaamiyon kii bhi shikaayatein hai
 The joint team of CAG and Railways has prepared this report after inspecting 74 stations and 80 trains
 kaig ne apni report main kaha ki rail main yatriyon ko di ja rahi khaadya vastuon ke sambandh main thekedaaron ne keemton ke saath samjhauta kiya or gunvattta maanakon par dhyaan nahin diya
 The action of the railway administration was not effective, there was also no effective action from the railway administration
 iske kaaran yatriyon ko khaadya or peya padaarthon ke zyada daam dene pade or thekedaaron ne steshnon par asvachh or nimna gunvattta vaale khaadya padaartho kaa vikray jari rakhaa
 The cag's report on 'catering Services in Indian Railways' tabled in Parliament on Friday said that in relation to railway catering, there is a provision that the goods sold should be sold at fixed rates
 is prakaar kii prayek vastu kaa mulya rail prashasan ke dwaara nirdhaarit kiya jayega or yatriyon se adhik prabhaar nahin liya jayega
 These items include biscuits, sealed products, sweets, etc
 inhen piedi vasteen kaha jaataa he or inhen licensadhari ikaayiyon ke saath-saath vibhageeya khanpan seva ikaiyon main bechaa jaataa he
 According to the report it is observed that the brand is selected by the Zonal Railways, but does not mention the prices
 brands ke adhikrut vikreta ko is shart ke saath emarpy par vikray kii anumati di gai he ki khule bazaar main vikray kiye gaye samaan utpaada kii emarpy se adhik nahin ho
 According to the CAG, PAD items were being sold at railway stations of different weight and price compared to the open market, in which the cost per unit in railway premises was much higher than the market selling price
 itnaa hi nahin, jurmaana lagaae jane ke baavjood yatriyon se zyada daam lene or shoshan ke maamle jari rahe
 The new catering policy also states in the neutral report that according to the catering policy of 2005, the Indian Railways handed over the catering business to the Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC)
 saal 2010 main is niti main phir se sanshodhan kiya gaya or bhartiya rail ne IRCTC se food plaza evam fast food uniton ko chhodkar sabhi khan-paan ikaayiyon kaa prabandhan waapas lene or inhen vibhageeya rup se prabandhit karne kaa nirnay kiya
 The Railway Board formulated the New Food Policy 2017, which was released on 27 February 2017, as the quality of catering facilities did not improve as expected
 iske baavjood halaat nahin sudhar rahe hai
 Increasing the suzerainty of some of the firms of the railway, the report said that non-compliance of the prescribed maximum limit for awarding contracts to the contractors encouraged the suzerainty of some firms
 ekadhipaty ke kaaran yatriyon ko pradaan kii jane vaali sevaaon kigunvattta se samjhauta hua
 Frequent changes in catering policy and transfer of responsibility of management of catering units to IRCTC from Railways and withdrawal have resulted in instability in the management of catering services provided to passengers
 isamen baar-baar parivartan ke kaaran railway or iarsitisi ke bich samanvay vishyon or thekedaaron ke saath vaidhanik vivaad bade hai
 CAG Recommendation: In its recommendations, the CAG said that during the construction of kitchens, the policy of transfer of electric energy equipment from gas burners should be kept in mind
 lambii duuri kii trainon ke maamle main niti ke anusaar rasoiyanon ke praavdhaan par vichaar kiya jaae
 The process of transfer of railway catering units to IRCTC should be facilitated and ensure that the Zonal Railways bear their obligations
 isamen kaha gaya he ki iarsitisi ko steshnon par paryaapt sankhya main sasta janata khaanaa pradaan karne ke liye daayitvabaddh kiya jaae or yatriyon ke bich ise prabhavi rup se prachaarit kiya jaae
 The CAG has suggested that catering providers improper practices such as overcharging, serving food below the prescribed quantity, selling unauthorized food items in stations and trains, not displaying price cards and issuing receipts for unsold food items To prevent non-functioning, effective check and control should be ensured by the Railways

 2012 main apni maa indrani mukherjee ke haathon kathith rup se jaan ganvaane vaali shina bora ke premi or sautele bhai rahul mukherjee se police ne ek agyaat jagah par poochtacha kii he
 According to sources, Rahul, son of former Star India CEO Peter Mukherjee, has given a statement to the police that on the night of Sheena's disappearance, his girlfriend sent him a SMS of a break-up
 yahi nahin, rahul ne yah bhi bataaya ki jab usne shina ke gaayab hone par sawaal khadey kiye to indrani ne use 'apni beti kaa peechha' chhod dene ke liye kaha
 Significantly, the police are considering the relationship between Indrani's first marriage with her daughter Sheena and Rahul as the reason for the murder
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki aakhri baar rahul or shina kii mulaakaat 24 april 2012 ko hui thi jab kuch ghante baad hi shina apni maa ke saath car main baithkar dobaaraa kabhi na milane ke liye gaayab ho gai thi
 Sheena, 22, was murdered the same night
 rahul ne police ko bataaya ki usne shina ke gaayab hone kii shikaayat darj karne kii koshish kii thi
 According to sources, Indrani had told the police at that time that Rahul is constantly following Sheena, due to which she has gone to America
 rahul se shina ke saath aakhri mulaakaat or uske gaayab hone kii shikaayat se sambandhit poochtacha kii ja rahi he
 If sources are to be believed, Rahul will also be asked if Sheena ever disclosed that she is Indrani's sister and not her daughter
 tippaniyan Please tell that 43-year-old Indrani had told Sheena as her half-sister in front of everyone
 police kaa maananaa he ki guwahati main indrani ke abhibhavak ke saath pali badi shina ne is jhooth kaa pardaafash karne kii dhamkee di thi
 Rahul is also informed about a conversation with Sheena's brother Michael Bora, who was allegedly with Rahul during an attempt to lodge a complaint
 saath hi ho saktaa he ki rahul se indrani or shina ke bich kisi tarah ke aarthik matbhed ke bare main bhi poochtacha kii jaae jo shaayad is hatyakand kii ek or vajah ho sakati he
 Significantly, Indrani was present in the car along with her first husband Sanjeev Khanna and her driver while strangling Sheena Bora

 sutron ke mutabik us vakt indrani ne police se kaha tha ki rahul lagaataar shina kaa peechha kar rahaa he jisaki vajah se vah america chali gai he
 Rahul is being questioned regarding his last meeting with Sheena and his disappearance complaint
 sutron kii maane to rahul se yah bhi poocha jayega ki kya shina ne kabhi bhi is baat kaa khulaasa kiya ki vah indrani kii bahan nahin beti he
 The comments bataa den ki 43 saal kii indrani ne sabake saamne shina ko apni sauteli bahan bataaya rakhaa tha

 rahul se shina ke bhai maaykele bora ke saath baatcheet ke bare main bhi jaankaree lee gai he jo kathith rup se shikaayat darj karne kii koshish ke dauraan rahul ke saath the

 Jaitley announced a corpus fund of Rs 500 crore for this
 jetali ne apane bajet bhaashan main kaha, 'andhra pradesh, pashchim bengal, maharashtra ke vidarbha or uttar pradesh ke purvanchal main ames jaise santhaan kholane kii yojana par vichaar kiya ja rahaa he

 'unhone kaha, 'main iske liye 500 rupee kii dhanrashi prastaav karata hum
 'it is worth mentioning that in 2006 the Manmohan Singh government approved the proposal to open aiims-like institutions across the country
 bhartiya janata party ke netritv vaali sarkaar ne 2003 main iskaa prastaav rakhaa tha
 AIIMS has emerged as the best government hospital in North India, with 1,800 beds
 yah pratidin lagbhag 9,000 logon kaa upachaar karata he
 AIIMS was first opened in Delhi, the country's capital
 yah saal 1956 main shuru hua tha
 On 13 September, the RSS has prepared the plan to write a new history and the BJP is ready to follow it
 yani pehali baar dilli chhod kisi rajya ke mukhyamantri par sansadeey board piem kii ummidavaari kii muhar lagaayegaa
 For the first time, LK Advani, the oldest and most experienced leader sitting on the parliamentary board and commanding the Jana Sangh to the BJP, has to agree on Modi's name
 saath hi murali manohar joshi, venkaiya naidu or nitin gadakari jo ki bijepi ke adhyaksh rah chuke hai, vah khamoshi se modi ke naam par muhar lagaayenge
 And Sushma Swaraj, the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, must also accept the candidature of the PM, considering the Gujarat CM as not only the leader but also the leader of the country
 yani bijepi main jo abhi tak nahin hua vah pehali baar hoga
 And in front of the Sangh Parivar, who has created this new state of BJP, LK has said in many meetings that what is happening now in BJP is happening for the first time
 lekin mahatvapurn he ki sangh ne bhi pehali baar kaha he ki maujuuda vakt main desh bhi ek khaas badlaav dekh rahaa he or yah badlaav bijepi ko karnaa hoga
 In fact, the effect that the Sangh has drawn on Modi is that the stature of all the leaders of the Center in Delhi has become small
 or lokapriyata ke paimaane par modi ke naam ke aage har koi natmastak he
 Bhishma Pitamah is upset? Will LK Advani's career in BJP on the lines of Bhishma Pitamah will end after 13th September
 yah sabase bada sawaal he, kyonki guru or guide kii bhoomika main aane se lagaataar inkaar karte adwani ko pehali baar modi ke rup main aisa aainaa dekhnaa padegaa yah kisi ne sochaa naa hoga
 And for this reason, the process of celebrating Advani started from Tuesday evening itself
 nitin gadakari ne adwani se mulaakaat kii or mulaakaat ke turant baad nagpur ravaanaa ho gayi
 Gadkari is to meet Sarsangh driver Mohan Bhagwat in Nagpur
 or isi kadi main 12 sitambar ko bijepi adhyaksh rajnath singh adwani se milenge
 And if Advani is upset then Mohan Bhagwat's bell will ring at Advani's house
 or isse pehle adwani apane har nagpur daure ke dauraan jis tarah kehete rahe hai ki sangh ke swayamsevak ke taur par hi unhone sabakuch paaya to phir baghawat kaa sawaal hi nahin uthta he
 According to the information, on September 13, all the members of the parliamentary board are in Delhi and Rajnath Singh has entrusted the task of convening a meeting of the parliamentary board and none to Ramlalji
 raamalaal kii bhoomika sangh kii numaayindagi karnaa he
 That is, Rajnath Singh must have been calling the meeting, but when Ramlal will take the letter and go to the members of the parliamentary board, then who will deny it is a big question in itself
 lekin aupchaarik taur par rajnath singh 12 sitabanr ko adwani ke alaava murali manamohar joshi, sushamaa swaraj se bhi milenge
 That is, the manner in which the Sangh has been openly angry with the leaders of Delhi for the accession of Delhi, what is the point if the unhappy leaders do not arrive at the time of the parliamentary board meeting? Though such tradition has not been in the Sangh's volunteers, but it would also be understood that at the time of Mohan Bhagwat's birth, Advani had stepped into the Sangh's public life
 rajyasabha sadsy amar singh kii kareebi vishwaasapaatr abhinetri evam saansad jayaprada ne guuruuvaar ko kaha ki samaajawaadee party (sapa) ke purv netaa singh yadi sachai bayaan karte hai to kai log mushkil main aa jaaenge
 Singh is an accused in the note for vote during the 2008 motion of confidence
 tasveeron main dekhen koun-koun viipi band hai dilli kii tihaad jail mempatrakaron se baatcheet main loksabhaa saansad ne kaha ki kharaab swasthya ke chalate aspataal main ilaaj kara rahe amar singh ne kathinaayee sahane ke baavjood unhen or anya logon ko chup rahane ke liye kaha he
 Jayaprada said, "despite being treated badly, Singh is trying to tarnish his image
" unhone khud chuppi saadh rakhi he or hamen bhi kuch na bolne ke liye kaha he
 When the right time comes, he will reveal everything himself
 ’video dekhen: 
 
 
 And crying Jaya Prada, the actress expressed anger at the distance from politicians and celebrities from Amar Singh
 unhone kaha, ‘aay se adhik sampatti ke maamle main amar singh ne mulaayam singh kaa sahyog kiya
 
 unhone yahaan tak ki apane jivan kii parvaah nahin kii
 i want to ask if Amar Singh has become such a big enemy? ”jayaprada asked,“ Why did he not come forward to help Singh right in the name of humanity? kya vah samaaj or raajnneeti se itane bhaybheet hai?’dekhie amar singh kaa bollywood conekshaubhinetri ne amitabh bachchan or unke parivaar ke bare main sanket karte hue kaha, ‘un badi hastiyon jinhen singh ne madad kii

 But no matter how strong the Congress' confidence in accepting Kurien's innocence, at the moment after mentioning his name in the statements of the four accused, doubts have started to emerge on the story of whether Kurien was around 7 pm on February 19, 1996 Kumily was in the vicinity of the guesthouse where a 16-year-old girl was allegedly raped? However, Kurien has always stood by his point that he was in Thiruvalla on the said day and time, which is two hours away from Kumily

 The BCCI and Sahara group reached an agreement after serious discussions over the last few days, paving the way for Pune Warriors to play in the fifth phase of the Indian Premier League (IPL)
 sahaara ne chaar farvari ko board se sambandh todate hue team india ke praayojan se hatane kaa faisla kiya tha
 But after the agreement was reached after 12 days, it was decided that Sahara would remain the sponsor of the Indian team
 bisisiai or sahaara donon ne sanyukt bayaan jari kiye jisamen anubandh kii vistrut jaankaree di hui he
 It also mentions other things besides the reactivation of the Pune Warriors auction and the expansion of the trading window
 yuvaraj singh kii jagah kisi anya khilaadi ko shaamil karne ke vivaadaaspad mudde ke sambandh main sahaara ne peshkash kii he ki vah sabhi franchiji tiimon se ipel maichon main paanch videshi khilaadiyon ko utaarne kii sahmati praapt karegaa
 Yuvraj Singh is undergoing treatment for lung cancer in America
 sanyukt bayaan ke anusaar, ‘trading windo pehle 17 farvari ko samaapt honi thi lekin pune varirs india ko anya frenchiji tiimon se baatcheet kaa mauka pradaan karne ke liye ise 29 farvari 2012 tak kar diya he
 According to the statement, the auction process of Pune Warriors India has been re-released so that it can add players to the team as per the team composition rule
 ’bisisiai or sahaara ne madhyasthata karrwai shuru karne par bhi sahmati jataa di he jisaki pahal sahaara ne kii thi
 Under this, an arbitrator will be appointed who will address this corporate company's claim of reducing franchise fees for 74 matches

 The right to host the play-off match belongs to the ground of the teams that reached the final of the previous season and thus the right to Royal Challengers Bangalore
 sahaara ne frenchiji fees ke liye back ganrti ko do hisson main dene kaa bhi aagrah kiya tha or bisisiai ne ise agali baithak main vichaar karne par sahmati jataa di he
 According to the statement, 'sahara confirmed that he will remain the sponsor of the Indian team
 samjhaute ke anusaar sahaara praayojan dene ke adhikaar ko jari rakhana chahega
 Sahara has been a sponsor of the Indian team for the last 11 years and on February 4, he decided to withdraw from the BCCI complaining that complaints related to his number of players and matches were not addressed
 bisisiai agar yah samjhauta nahin kar paata to use 2000 karod rupee kaa nuksaan ho saktaa tha
 However, the board could find another sponsor to make up for it
 vishesh rajya kaa darja praapt rajyon ko rinmukt kendriya sahaayta ke atirikt bhi laabh hote hai
 In such a state, if an industry or factory is set up on the basis of private capital investment, then a substantial exemption is also provided in central taxes like excise duty, customs duty, income tax, sales tax and corporate tax, making it profitable to invest in the state
 It seems is tarah kaa nivesh hone se rajya main rojgaar ke avasar bhi utpann hote hai

 siyaasi jang kaa sikandar
 
 or desh kii rajdhani main aam aadmi kaa shahenshaah
 
 
 This is the story of Arvind Kejriwal's success
 
 Kejriwal, who took the front from Delhi and the central government in 2013, is now sitting as the government himself
 kejariwal to kaamyaab ho gaye, lekin aam aadmi ke liye kamyaabi kii manzil abhi dur he
 In a month Kejriwal, the leader of the Aam Aadmi Party, has achieved a lot, but what did the common man get? The common man, who is the real strength of Kejriwal's party, came to his part
 
 The The last one month has changed both the appearance and the beauty of the Aam Aadmi Party in Delhi, but the fate of Delhi is yet to change
 
 The common man has not forgotten the promises made to millions of Delhiites before becoming the Chief Minister and after assuming the cm's crown
 sabase pehle baat us din kii, jis din kejariwal ne khud ko ab tak ke saare mukhyamantri se alag dikhaane kii koshish kii
 Day of swearing
 aam aadmi ke khaas netaa kejariwal siem kii shapath lene metro se gaye
 It was a historical moment
 behad aam aadmi kii tarah kaushambi se metro main aae arvind kejariwal
 But, there was so much discussion that there was a huge crowd on the roads inside and outside the metro to see the Chief Minister
 yani kejariwal aam aadmi kii tarah metro se to aae lekin unka ye safar roj metro main aane vaale aam aadmi ke liye musiibat ban gaya
 When Kejriwal reached Ramlila Maidan, thousands of common people welcomed him
 kyonki pehali baar ramlila maidan main nayaa itihaas likhaa ja rahaa tha
 But this style of changing history greatly increased the budget of the oath taking ceremony
 aam aadmi ko ye jashn bahut mahangaa padaa
 After taking oath of Chief Minister, Kejriwal first announced to make politicians a common man
 unhone apni puri cabinet ke liye lalabatti ke istemaal ko red signal dikhaa diya
 The ministers turned down the red light, but could not stay away from the VIP culture altogether
 viipi numbers kii gaadiyaan isaki gavaah hai
 Apart from this, the ministers who reached the assembly by auto and metro in the first two days started coming in the vehicles from the third day itself
 ise lekar vivaad hue
 But the common man did not get anything
 
 The Kejriwal government made another big announcement in front of the people of Delhi
 bade-bade bangalon se khud ko or apane mantriyon ko dur rakhane kaa sankalp liya
 But the common man and the Delhi government's prince himself started preparing for a house entrance in a 10-room bungalow
 mukhyamantri ke bade bangale par vivaad hua to unhen ehsaas hua ki wo aam aadmi hai
 And the common man cannot even dream of a house with ten rooms
 mukhyamantri ne janata ke naam ek or sandesh diya tha
 That they will not take heavy security like leaders
 sarkaar kii daleel ye thi ki pulicekarmi janata kii suraksha main tainaat hon naa ki netaaon ke saath rahen
 But UP Police has z Security at Kejriwal's house and secretariat also has a heavy security cordon
 kejariwal ko do rajyon kii police suraksha mili he
 But, what did the common man get
 
 The Chief Minister arrived from the Metro to take oath
 
 
 aam aadmi ne taaliyaan bajaain lekin unke haath khaali hi rahe
 
 mantriyon ne lalabatti chhod di
 
 janata ko phir bhi kuch nahin mila
 
 mukhyamantri ne bada ghar lene se inkaar kar diya
 
 lekin aam aadmi ko kya mila
 
 ? 30 din main sarkaar ek ke baad ek kai elaan karti chali gai, lekin aam aadmi ke maathe kii shikan kam nahin hui

 Perhaps this is the reason why the bureaucrats who were crying in the voice of Mayawati heard the call for change of power janvari ke pehle hafte main hi chah naukarshahon ne centre main pratiniyukti ke liye aavedan kar diya tha
 He feared that after the change of power, he could be appointed on the Punishment posting
 is tarah kii pratiniyukti amuman paanch saal ke liye hoti he
 After the formation of Samajwadi Party (SP) government, many of these officers have got the green signal to deploy in New Delhi
 duusari ore, mayawati ke shashan kaal main gaiyr-mahatvapurn padon par tainaat naukarshah behatar pad paane kii laalasaa main sapa netaaon se najdiki badha rahe hai
 The apprehension of bureaucrats close to Mayawati proved to be correct on 15 March

 All these officers have been kept waiting for new posts
 mayawati sarkaar main ek cabinet sachiv, paanch pramukh sachiv or teen sachiv the
 After the defeat of Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), the first Cabinet Secretary Shashank Shekhar Singh resigned
 mayawati ko jab 2007 main purna bahumat mila to unhone apane party sahyogiyon kii bajaae afasarshahi par zyada bharosa jataayaa or satta kii bagdor unheen naukarshahon ko de di
 For the first time, the post of cabinet secretary was created over the state bureaucracy and it was placed on Shashank Shekhar who was neither an officer of the Indian Administrative Service (IAS) nor the Provincial Administrative Service (PCS), but merely a pilot
 par vidambnaa yah ki apane paanch varsh ke shasankaal ke dauraan mayawati do darjan baar bhi apane us daftar main nahin baithi jo sachivalay (anexi) ke pancham tal par mukhyamantri ke liye bana he or jahaan se rajya kaa kaamkaaj sanchalit hota he
 Shashank, who sits on the fifth floor (colloquially in the Chief Minister's office at the Secretariat), worked as a 'defacto' chief minister in a way
 rajya ke mantri cabinet sachiv se milane ke liye qatari main baithte the
 Mayawati wanted to send Shashank to the Rajya Sabha but she had to step back due to opposition from party members and mlas
 kuch varisht sadasyon kaa kahana tha ki basapa kii haar ke peeche naukarshahon kii nirankushta jimmedaar he
 The Rajya Sabha route may have been blocked for Shashank, but the Mayawati government has made arrangements for a peon and a driver, even after being sacked from the government job for cabinet secretary through cabinet by-circulation
 pramukh sachiv ke rup main dalit varg ke iees afasar kunwar fateh bahadur ke hawaale puure pradesh ke afasaron kaa sthanantaran or tainaati ke saath grih vibhaag kaa bhi jimmaa tha
 IAS Netram, a 1979 batch IAS, was posted in the Chief Minister's Secretariat as an important secretary
 aabkaari, ganna evam chini udyog vibhaag ke pramukh sachiv ke rup main un par kai tarah ke aarope lage
 Later, Netram was made the principal secretary of the Chief Minister along with the responsibilities of the Principal Secretary of the said departments and was seated on the fifth floor
 sapa sarkaar main unhen kisi mahatvaheen pad par bheja ja saktaa he
 Among the officers posted on the fifth floor, 1984 batch IAS officer Durga Shankar Mishra was a special choice of Cabinet Secretary Shashank Shekhar
 mishra ko brahman chehre ke rup main mukhyamantri kaa pramukh sachiv banaaya gaya
 Along with this, he was also given the additional charge of Principal Secretary, Civil Aviation, Tax and Registration and later the Municipal Development Department

 P
 singh ko bhi centre sarkaar main pratiniyukti par tainaati ke liye jaruri anaapatti praaanpatr hasil ho chukaa he
 Apart from the principal secretaries, the most popular among the secretary-level officers posted on the fifth floor and Navneet Sehgal, an IAS officer close to Mayawati, is not certain
 2007 main mayawati ke shapath grahan ke samay dilli main pratiniyukti se laute 1988 batch ke iees adhikari sahagal mukhyamantri ke sachiv ke saath hi nagar vikaas, rajya sampatti or urja vibhaagon kaa bhi atirikt shaskeey daayitv nibhaa rahe the
 There is a buzz in the corridors of power that Sehgal has approached Mulayam Singh Yadav through senior SP leaders
 2007 main mayawati kii sarkaar banane ke dauraan 1988 batch ke dalit iees adhikari anil sant centre main tainaat the
 Due to his proximity to the BSP chief, he was called from the center and posted as the secretary of the chief minister
 baad main sant ko atirikt awaas ayukta or basic shiksha vibhaag ke sachiv kaa kaarybhaar bhi saunp diya gaya par pradesh main nai sarkaar main talmail kii gunjaaish na dekhte hue sant waapas centre main pratiniyukti par jane kaa man bana chuke hai or iske liye unhen aavashyak anaapatti bhi mil chuki he
 Like the saint, another Dalit IAS officer Chandrabhanu has also completed the necessary action for deployment at the center
 pancham tal par tainaat afasar hi nahin balki mayawati ke kareebi kuch or afasaron ne bhi centre main tainaati ke liye jaruri aupchaariktaayen puri kar lee hai
 These include Sushil Kumar, Secretary, Department of Agriculture, Science and Technology Secretary Mohammad Mustafa and Environment Secretary Rajesh Kumar Singh
 mayawati ke chahete afasaron ke soobe se baahar tainaati kii chaah ke maddenjar sapa ke pradesh pravaktaa rajendra choudhary kehete hai, ''sapa sarkaar kisi bhi adhikari ke viruddh raajnneetik dwesh se kaary nahin karegi
 Yes, it is definitely that action will be taken against the officials who spread corruption in the Mayawati government
 ''mayawati ke pasandida afasar yadi apane liye duusare thikaane talash rahe hai to basapa sarkaar main haashie par rahe mulaayam singh ke pasandida adhikari bhi sapa sarkaar main apane liye badhiya posting kii jugat main lag gaye hai
 Senior IAS officer posted on deputation in the central government, Anil Kumar Gupta, has returned to the state
 iees adhikari shailesh krishna, kumaar arvind singh dev, anitha singh, nitin gokarn, niraj gupta, sanjay bhaatia, anuraag yadav, santosh yadav, shanbhu singh yadav evam pranjal yadav ko mahatvapurn vibhaagon main tainaat kiya ja saktaa he
 The increasing tendency of the officers of the state to show loyalty towards the politicians rather than the public, was noticed by Professor Dr
 in the Department of Political Science at Lucknow University
 ramesh dikshit loktantr ke liye kaaphi ghaatak maanate hai
 He says, "instead of deploying competent and qualified officers to important posts, the government gives priority to its officers, so that they can be made to do the work they want
" acchhee posting paane kii chaah main afasar bhi rajanetaaon kaa ativishwasaneey banane kii koshish karte hai
 It weakens the service of the public and the ambitions of the officials become effective
 ''baharhaal, ek ore jahaan pradesh ke ek varg ke naukarshahon kii mahatvakankshaayen jaag gai hai, vahiin basapa ke raaj main janpratinidhiyon se bhi zyada prabhaavshaalee rahe mayawati ke kareebi naukarshahon ke liye pareshaani kaa daur shuru ho gaya he
