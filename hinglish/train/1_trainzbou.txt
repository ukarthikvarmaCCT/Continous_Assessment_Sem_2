 This bungalow was given to him when Tejashwi Yadav was the Deputy Chief Minister in the Grand Alliance government, but when the NDA government was formed in Bihar, it was allotted to Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi
 supreme court ke aadesh ke baad tejasvi yadav ne yah bangala khaali kiya to susheel modi ne paaya ki isamen paisa pani kii tarah bahaya gaya he
 Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Modi and the then building minister Maheshwar Hazari had then said that it would be investigated, but the Principal Secretary on behalf of the government clearly said that no investigation had been done in the matter

 On the complaint of the parents, the police has registered a case
 hairaani kii baat to yah he ki rajya sarkaar ne khaas taur par skulon ke liye fees niyaman par haal main nayaa kanoon banaaya he
 Despite this, the Silver Bells Public School in Bhavnagar took 160 children as hostage for a mere fee
 abhibhavakon kaa aarope he ki skool unase manamaani fees vasuulate hai
 Similar arbitrariness of school administration has come to light in Bhavnagar
 aakhirkaar police jab skool pahunchi tab jaakar bacchon ko mukt karaayaa gaya or ve apane ghar laut sake
 This case came to light when Adityraj Singh Jhala, a student studying in 7th standard, did not return from school on time
 aditya ke time par ghar na pahunchane kii vajah se pareshaan maa ne uske pita ko phone kar jaankaree di ki betaa ab tak ghar nahin lautaa he
 When Aditya's father Dharmaraj Singh Jhala called the school, the school principal informed that the school administration has stopped the students whose fees are left
 principal ne bataaya ki kul 160 chaatro ko skool main hi roak liya gaya he
 The most surprising thing is that Aditya Komhaj stopped the school administration for 600 rupees
 aditya ke pita ne bataaya ki aditya kii puri fees 38,800 rupee unhone check ke jariye pe kar diya tha
 But he was not aware that the school had increased the bus fees by Rs 200 per month and Aditya's bus had a three-month fee, ie Rs 600 left
 principal ne aditya ke pita ko bataaya ki fees baaki hone kii vajah se bacchon ko rokkar rakhaa gaya he or jab tak fees adaa nahin kar di jaati, aditya ko ghar nahin bheja jayega
 Although Aditya's father said that he would pay the full fee the next day, the school principal did not allow Aditya to return home
 aakhirkaar aditya ke pita ne police control room phone kar skool ke khilaaf shikaayat kii
 Police reached the school on the complaint and free the children
 tab kahin jaakar bachche ghanton deree se apane-apane ghar laute
 Dharamraj Singh has filed a complaint against the school in this case with the District Collector, District Education Officer and Police

 hamaare samaaj main mahila or purush ke bich beete un palon ko pardon ke peeche chipa kar rakhe jate hai
 This is the reason why most people have misgivings about those moments in the bed

 Religious saints reduce the age of those who love more at bed
 unke mutabik zyada sambandh banane se aayu kam hoti he or sharir main kai tarah ke rog ban jate hai
 But very few people know that physical relationships not only relieve stress, but also keep your body healthy
 pyaar bhare un palon se aap paa sakate hai kai pareshaaniyon se najaat
 
 
 Take away the chronic pain
 Next time, when the headache that has been haunting you for years, bothers, then say yes to your partner instead of saying no to the bed
 unke saath sambandhon ko bharpoor tareeke se enjvaay karen
 During the relationship, the body of women makes many painkillers such as androphin, corticosteroids
 or to or aap yah jaanakar or bhi khush hongi ki ek baar sambandh banane ke baad aap kam se kam do din tak to apane us puraane dard ko mahasoos nahin karengi
 So instead of keeping distance from your partner due to chronic pain, bring him closer to you and get rid of the pain with love
 dil ko rakhe javalgar aap khaane kii apni aadat par control nahin kar pate, to janaab kaam chaahe jitna bhi kyon na ho apane saathi ke saath bistar par pal jarur bitaayen
 Because you do not need to do the exercise that you ask for not being able to do it by building a relationship
 ji haa, bistar par saathi ke saath bitaye pyaar ke palon bhare sambandh aapke sharir main maujuud calories ko kharch karne kaa kaam karte hai, jiske liye aapako kam se kam subah 5 baje uth kar 2 yaa 3 kilometre tak saiyr kerani padati he, vah ab aap bistar par apane saathi kii bahon main paa sakate hai
 Aji and what a healthy heart
 
 
 tanaav ko kahen bikeya aap kaam ke boj se pareshaan rahete hai
 Be it home or office or a picnic moment, you are always disturbed by the stress of work, so fresh yourself once, take a little bath and eat your beautiful wife and admire instead of sleeping
 man ko thakaan yaa subah jaldi uthne kaa bahaanaa na den
 Putting aside all the problems, once you enjoy the relationship on the bed, then see how all your stress is upsetting

 The Narendra Modi government is completing the fourth year of its tenure and rising crude oil prices have given a U-turn to its good days
 beete chaar saal ke dauraan jahaan kachche tel kii keemton ne modi sarkaar kii rajasav ke kshetra sabase zyada madad kii he
 Now, with the ever increasing prices of petrol and diesel, it has become clear that along with falling on the pocket of common man, the prices of petrol and diesel can now spoil the economics of both the central government and the state government
 modi sarkaar ke kaarykaal se pehle manmohan singh sarkaar main aam aadmi ko mahangaai kaa maar pad rahi thi
 While crude oil was selling at the top level in the global market, the price of petrol and diesel during 2013 in the country was disturbing the mathematics of the government
 pehla mahange petrol-dijal se badti mahangaai or doosraa mahange kachche tel se badhata sarkari kharch or sarkaar kaa simatata rajasav
 Read this: From the GDP to inflation, how much did Modi measure on these parameters of the economy, inflation and petrol and diesel prices became a big issue in the 2014 general elections
 pradhanmantri pad kii daavedaari kar rahe narendra modi ne apni prachaar reliyon main vaada kiya ki unke dwaara laayaa janaa vaala acha din saste petrol or dijal kaa hoga
 Why did not petrol and diesel price rise? With the formation of the Modi government in 2014, there was a huge fall in the prices of crude oil worldwide
 is giravat ke bich un sabhi deshon ko phayda pahunchnaa shuru ho gaya jo kachche tel ke liye aayaat par nirbhar the or kachche tel ke bade upabhokta bhi
 But despite promising elections, the Modi government decided to boost the government's income by imposing a large tax on the sale of petrol and diesel in the country to prevent the direct benefit of the global fall in crude oil prices from reaching the consumer

 iske chalate kendra sarkaar kii petrol-dijal kii bikri se kamai do guni ho gai
 Where in FY 2014, the central government earned only 0 of GDP from tax on petrol and diesel

 nateeja yah ki kendra sarkaar ke is faisle se aam aadmi ke liye petrol dijal kii keemten kam nahin ho sakin
 Read this: MODI @ 4: Where did the stock market of the country reach in the last four years, besides the central government, the state governments also blocked the way of cheap petrol and diesel for the common man
 kendra sarkaar ke exide duty se alag rajya sarkaron ne petrol-dijal kii bikri par cells tex main bada ijapha kar diya
 During this slippage in the prices of crude oil, the state governments increased VAT on petrol by about 40 percent and on diesel it was increased by about 28 percent
 iske chalate donon kendra or rajya sarkaron ne aam aadmi tak sasta petrol-dijal nahin pahunchane diya
 See this: Modi government can save this way with expensive petrol and diesel? 500 or 1,000 rupee band hone par online pement sarvice dene vaali sabase company petm ke kaarobaar ken 435 fisadi kaa oochaal aayaa he or petm pradhanmantri modi ke is faisle ko bhunaane main koi mauka nahin chhod rahaa

 Anupam ji has written that this new society does not have so much euphoria in the mind that who used to build so many ponds before that
 gajdhar yani jo naapane ke kaam aata he
 Used to roam with three-handed iron rods
 samaaj ne ise mistre nahin kaha, sundar sa naam diya gajdhar
 Gajadhar was the architect
 gajdhar hindu the or baad main musalmaan bhi
 Sometimes also called Silavata
 isliye rajasthan ke puraane shaharon main silavatapada mohalle mil jaaenge or karachi main bhi silaavaton kaa puraa-puraa mohalla he
 Even in Gajadhar, there were siddhas who used to tell with just a guess that there is water here
 yahaan talab banaao
 People of all castes and sections made pond work
 is kitaab main dilli kaa zikr he
 Delhi had 350 ponds before the arrival of the British
 usee daur main dilli main nal lage
 When the procession used to sit in the pan, the women used to sing that the Firangi did not put tap
 lekin nal lagate gaye or talab kuen or baavadiyon ke badale angrezon dwaara niyantrit water works se pani aane laga
 The book has an episode of Sagar of Madhya Pradesh
 koi 600 saal pehle lakh banjaare ne sagar naam kaa vishaal talab banaaya

 The university is the district headquarters, police training center
 ek banjaaraa yahaan aayaa or vishaal sagar banaakar chalaa gaya lekin nae samaaj kii ye saadhan sampann sansthaaen is sagar kaa dekhbhaal nahin kar sakin
 The comments aap bhi is kitaab ko isi tarah baanch sakate hai
 We drink water, but know little about water
 dhire-dhire companiyon ke naam janenge or pani ke bare main bhul jaaenge

 Very few people are able to write such language

 Anupam Mishra has gone, this is not a big deal, the society that knows water is gone, this is a big thing

 You will not understand that a writer has gone, a school to make man a man has been closed

 During this time, a person from Raipur received a severe blow

 Manish was asked to get details of the Rs 40 crore transaction from his current bank account of Vijay Bank
 manish ke mutabik, jis bank khate se yah len-dein hua, vah bank khaataa unhone khulwaaya hi nahin or naa hi us khate kaa kabhi istemaal kiya
 When he went to the bank and asked for the account information, the bank officials refused to give him any information
 kaaphi jirah karne or maamle kii police main shikaayat karne kii chetavanee ke baad bank karmiyon ne unhen us khate kii jaankaree di
 On seeing the bank statement, Manish was aghast that the account in which crores of transactions have taken place is in the name of Manish

 kya aapane kabhi sochaa he ki arvind kejariwal ke prachaar kaa sabase bada hathiyaar kya he? kya aapane kabhi is baat par gaur kiya he ki dilli vidhansabha chunaav main aisi koun si cheez thi, jisase kejariwal kaa prachaar baakiyon se alag dikhaa
 
 
 During the Delhi Assembly elections, the congress-bjp rallied, and Kejriwal used to hold a public meeting if it was a small nook and corner
 lekin is sabake alaava ek or cheez thi, jisane kejariwal ke liye dilli main maahaul banaaya


rodsho


 rodsho yani janata ke bich kisi aabaadi yaa bheedbhad vaali sadak, gali, mohalle se khuli jeep main nikalnaa or public kaa abhivadan sweekaar karnaa
 In the month of November, Kejriwal started a roadshow and continued till the end of the election campaign
 iskaa nateeja sabake saamne he
 The election results in Delhi failed everyone, only Kejriwal was able to pass
 asal main rodsho aajkal ke logon ke life−style se mail khaataa he
 The public is no longer such that, going miles away, standing in a crowd for hours listening to a leader
 iske bhi kai kaaran hai
 The first is that the public has no longer any special expectation from the leader
 doosraa, aajkal shaharon main logon ke paas samay kii khaasi kami rahati he, aise main raily ke liye public ko jutanaa mushkil kaam he
 The people of the village still come, but in cities it is becoming difficult
 chunaav ke samay netaa ko janata kii jarurat hoti he, na ki janata ko netaa kii
 Now Kejriwal's main target is the city's voter, so what to do to reach among the public
 
 
 raily karne par bheed aane par maahaul banataa he or sandesh jaataa he ki kis party kaa kitna hallaa he
 But the question again is how many people will or will not come to the rally
 ye sab sawaal kejariwal ke saamne the dilli vidhansabha chunaav ke vakt or kejariwal ne in sawaalon kaa jawaab diya rodsho se
 Although it seems easy to say, moving around, talking to them, listening to them from morning to evening is not an easy task, especially when you are a diabetic patient
 yah ramakahani isliye sunai ki kejariwal ab loksabhaa chunaav main bhi apana yah hathiyaar jamkar chalaane vaale hai
 He will do a few rallies, some more public meetings and road shows
 shuruyaat hogi shanivaar 1 march se jab kejariwal apane kafile ke saath dilli se kanpur tak road sho karte jaaenge
 Rally in Kanpur on 2 March and Road Show returning to Kanpur again on 3 March
 iske baad vah hone vaala he, jiskaa janata, media or tamaam political party andaja lagaakar kaam chalaa rahi he
 On March 8, Arvind Kejriwal will do a roadshow in Narendra Modi's stronghold Ahmedabad and will also hold a public meeting
 shanivaar 8 march kaa din ahm rahegaa, najar mat hatiega
 On March 9, from Delhi to Mathura then roadshows and rally in Mathura
 11 march ko goa main pehle rodsho or phir jansabha
 There is a huge difference between Kejriwal's earlier roadshows and now
 pehle rodsho ek nai-naveli party ke netaa ke taur par kiye gaye the, lekin ab rodsho dilli kaa purv mukhyamantri karegaa
 a person who showed as much on TV as in the last three years, even the greatest Surma has not been seen in his entire life
 'aap' maanati he ki uskaa asli muqabla bijepi se he or isliye arvind kejariwal narendra modi par lagaataar tikhe hamale kar rahe hai
 Now in such a situation it can be said with certainty that Kejriwal's roadshow will be the answer to Modi's rally
 pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa sabase bada sapana puraa hone ja rahaa he
 While being the Chief Minister of Gujarat, Modi wanted a statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel to be the tallest in the world
 wo pratimaa ban chuki he jiskaa modi anaavaran karenge lekin aapako usamurtitak aise hi boat kii sawari se janaa hoga
 The largest statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, known as the Iron Man, is the first to reach Aaj Tak
 dekhiye kya he is murti kii khaasiyaten
 This 182-meter tall statue of two lift pipes will be installed in the statue is the tallest statue in the world
 iske aage naa to 120 meter oonchi china vaali spring buddha murti tikti he, naa hi 90 meter oonchi neuyork kii stachu of liberty
 Aaj Tak's team reached the place with complete preparation, as far as the construction work has been done
 saamne kii ore nayaa brij aam aadmi ke liye he ki log andar aaen or patel ke pair tak pahunche sidhiyon se
 There are two lifts, whereby two hundred people can go to Patel's chest where the gallery is
 vahaan se sardaar sarovar baandh tak kaa drishy dikhegaa
 Larsen & Turbo Company was contracted in October 2014 after 800 local and 200 Chinese laborers made Kamis statue to form the Modi government at the Center
 is par company ne 2989 karod rupee ke kharche kii baat kii thi
 4076 laborers worked in two shifts to achieve this work within the stipulated time
 isamen 800 sthaneey or 200 china se aae kaarigaron ne bhi kaam kiya
 With this, it became a statue in which the emotions are ironed and the brick and mortar of Armaan
 jacket ke batan kaa vyas dhai meter se zyada kaa heis murti kii bhavyata kaa andaja aap is baat se hi laga sakate hai ki unke jacket main tange batan kaa vyas hi dhai meter se zyada he
 This statue also shows the simplicity of Patel in which his folded dhoti-kurta, bundi and chadar were his identity
 ye sab kuch murti main dhal chukaa he
 Just waiting for the moment when the country will see the highest image of its Sardar Patel
 patel kii jindagi ke saare pahalu is murti ke aasapaas khulte jaaenge, kyonki iske basamenter main wo pradarshnee haul banegaa, jo patel kii yaadon ko samarpit hoga
 Raja is behind 182 meters height, the height of this huge statue is 182 meters
 isaki vajah ye he ki gujarat main vidhansabha kii 182 siten hai or un sabaki numaaindgi is murti main dikhaane kii koshish hui he
 More than this, there are political speculations about this statue in 2019
 piem modi 31 oktober ko karenge udghaatanhindustan ke pehle grih mantri or up pradhanmantri sardaar vallabh bhai patel kii sooyeeboojh or fauladi iraadon ne raaje rajavaadon kii jaagiron main bante or angrejon ke haathon lute-pite is desh ko ek raashtra ke rup main khadaa kar diya
 His same personality captivates this country and Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself is so convinced of his name and identity that he is inaugurating the world's largest statue of Patel, which he himself will inaugurate on October 31 on Patel's birth anniversary
 gujarat ke CM rahete modi ne kiya tha elaanpradhanmantri narendra modi ne gujarat kaa mukhyamantri rahete hi elaan kiya tha ki narmada jile main sardaar patel kii itani badi or bhavy murti banegi, jiske saamne stachu of liberty bhi nistej lagegi
 The project was announced by the Gujarat government about eight years ago when Modi was the chief minister
 lekin iskaa vidhivat elaan hua 2013 main
 Now this statue is almost ready
 gujarat ke mukhyamantri rahete hue pradhanmantri modi ne narmada jile ke is sadhupet ilaake main sardaar patel kii sabase oonchi murti kaa shilanyas kiya tha
 In five years, this idol has become almost ready for public viewing
 puure desh se maanga gaya tha lohasardaar patel kii shakhsiyat main wo dam tha ki unako sammaan se louh purush kaha jaataa tha
 That is why Prime Minister Narendra Modi had asked for iron from every corner of the country so that it would make Loha Patel's dreams steely
 murti ke shilanyas or udghaatan ke peeche ittefarub ye ittfa he yaa kuch or, lekin patel kii murti kaa shilanyas bhi tabhi hua tha, jab loksabhaa kaa chunaav hone vaala tha or udghaatan bhi tabhi hone ja rahaa he, jab 2019 kii chunavi aahat desh sunne laga he
 The Patidars may be angry patidaar andolan chalaa rahe hardik patel ke aarakshan ko lekar kiye ja rahe upwas se kahin patidaaron kii naaraazgi or naa bad jaae, isaki kaat ke rup main bhi patel kaa ye sammaan kaam kar saktaa he
 At the same time, politics of sentiment and respect on Patel's great personality can also be used in the next election
 murti kaa kaam kaise ho rahaa- ye jaanane ke liye dekhen ye video

 One of the world's biggest e-commerce websites, Alibaba's founder Jack Ma's favorite quote is the dialogue from actor Tom Hanks in the Hollywood film Forrest Gump, "life is like a box of chocolates, and you can't know , When are you going to get 
 
 " vaise, jaik maa kii kaarobaari zindagi kii 'maamuli' shuruyaat or 'anuthi' kamyaabi ko dekhakar to aisa hi lagata he, jaise 'forest gamp' ke lekhak ne yah pankti jaik ke liye hi likhi thi
 An interview of Jack Ma, recorded during the World Economic Forum held in Davos, has been republished, in which Jack was openly talking about his failures and his successful career
 ji haa, aapane sahi padhaa - jaik maa ke khate main bhi kai naakaamiyaan darj hai

 When he applied to be admitted to the police
 unhen harvard main daakhile se bhi 10 baar inkaar kiya gaya tha
 Jack said about it, "
 
 
 or maine sochaa tha, shaayad kisi din mujhe vahaan jaakar padhaanaa chahie
 
 
 "in response, TV host Charlie Rose said," such an arrangement can be made

 How martial arts can help your business
 unhone yah bhi bataaya ki jab vah varsh 1995 main pehali baar america gaye the, unka pehali baar internet se saamana hone par unhone kya kiya

 Not only this, they can also contest from their home district and Mulayam Singh's parliamentary seat Azamgarh
 uttar pradesh kii yogi sarkaar main cabinet mantri or suheldev bhartiya samaaj party ke adhyaksh om prakaash rajbhar ne 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main amar singh ko azamgarh seat se pratyaashee banaae jane kii maang kii he
 He said that if Azamgarh seat comes in my party, then our candidate will be Amar Singh

 om prakaash rajbharaki peshkash ke baad mana ja rahaa he ki bijepi azamgarh sansadeey seat par jeet kaa paracham lahraane ke liye amar singh kaa daanv chal sakati he
 In such a situation, the BJP can resort to the shoulders of the allies instead of directly landing Amar Singh
 aise main om prakaash rajbhar kii party bijepi ke liye trump card sabit ho sakati he
 Azamgarh Lok Sabha constituency has a significant number of voters all over the state
 aise main bijepi apane mul votbank ke saath-saath rajput or rajbhar maton ko ekajute karne kii yojana kaa phayda uthaa sakati he
 Amar Singh is originally from Azamgarh and many of his close leaders have joined BJP

 In such a situation, the contest can be quite interesting if he takes the field from this seat
 darasal amar singh pichley maheene 22 june ko om prakaash rajbhar ke putr arvind rajbhar kii shaadi main var-badhu ko aashirwad dene pahunche the
 During this time, he also advised Rajbhar to keep the quarrel with the BJP at home
 bataa den ki sapa se nikaale jane se baad se amar singh par bhartiya janata party (bijepi) kaa bhagava rang chadhane laga he
 He is also liking the policies of Prime Minister Narendra Modi

 According to a report by the American magazine Politico, the US Trump government is thinking of banning end to end encryption
 gauratlab he ki duniya kaa sabase zyada yuj kiya jane vaala instent miseging ap whatsapp is ancripshan par besd he
 Apart from this, the messages and face time of Apple are also end to end encryption based
 duusare sicyor eps jaise Signal bhi iskaa yuj karte hai
 To understand end to end encryption in simple terms, it is a kind of encryption system under which only the sender and receiver can read the message in the chatting done
 iske tahat na to company or na hi kisi desh kii koi kanoon agency us massej ko pard sakati he
 It is very much liked around the world for privacy, but in some countries it is objected
 Politico kii ek report ke mutabik america oficials sambhavit ancripshan bain ko lekar baatcheet kar rahe hai
 This report states that the Trump Administration has recently met to discuss this encryption system
 iske saath yah bhi bataaya ja rahaa he ki neshnal security council kii meeting main bhi and tu and ancripshan ko lekar baatcheet kii gai he or yah mukhya focus bhi rahaa he
 However, no decision has been taken so far and talks are still on whether to end or end encryption or change it
 aapako bataa den america president banane se pehle donald trump ne aipal kii aalochana kii thi
 The reason for this was Apple's decision not to unlock the iphone of a San Bernadino shooter
 aipal ne yujar kii privesi ko lekar apni policy kaa havala de kar iphone ko analock karne se saaf manaa kar diya tha
 However, the FBI later unlocked the iphone by paying approximately $ 1 million to a security firm
 report ke mutabik FBI ke is kadam ke baad aipal ne us khami ko bhi dur kiya jiskaa sahaara lekar FBI ne ek security form se yphone analock karaayaa tha
 If end to end encryption is removed, it will have an impact not only in the US but also in India

 Recently, an official of whatsapp said that if there is no end to end encryption in whatsapp, then its identity will be lost

 'when reporters asked the minister who attended the Bindal Kuldevi temple in Fatehpur, Sikar, on the increase in petrol-diesel prices, he said that petrol and diesel prices depend on the prices of crude oil in the international market, but the public knows this Do not understand World market mein jo crude ka price hota hai us hisaab se chalta hai, Sarkar koshish kar rahi hai
 Itna kharche hain, flood hain chaaro taraf, itna consumption hai

 gaurav yatra kaa kiya bachaavarinava ne kaha kicongresane jo apane 50 saal ke raaj main nahin kiya, wo hamane kar dikhaaya he
 On the criticism of Gaurav Yatrapar Congress, he said, the state government has indeed done the program of Gaurav, hence the Gaurava Yatra is going to the people
 gaurav yatra par bhi apana tark dete hue unhone sawaal kiya ki ham yadi ek kuan bhi banaate hai yaa mandir bhi banaate hai to uskaa bhi raatri jaagran or prasad baantkar gaurav manaate hai
 Here, a lot of development work has been done in the entire state with the construction of houses for 26 lakh people, so why should the government not celebrate its glory? bihar main loksabhaa chunaav main mahagathbandhan or NDA main koun koun se dal rahenge yah saafe ho gaya
 The most curious thing was about Ram Vilas Paswan's Lok Janshakti Party, which under pressure created six Lok Sabha seats and a question of prestige from the BJP
 1 Rajya Sabha was able to win its seat
 vahiin san of mallaah ke naam se mashhoor mukesh saahani mahagathbandhan ke saath gayi
 Mukesh Sahni has formed a party called Vikas Insan Party (VIP) only last month
 akhbaaron or tivi channel main vigyaapan dekar surkiyo main bane rahane vaale mukesh ne haal ke samay main helicopter se prachaar shuru kar diya tha
 Their main demand is that the Nishad caste be included in the list of scheduled castes
 haalanki bihar sarkaar ne centre sarkaar ko isaki anushansa bhej di he
 Tejashwi said on Kushwaha's involvement in Mahagathbandhan - not of parties but 'alliance of hearts of the people' Mukesh, who joined the grand alliance, first supported Nitish Kumar in last assembly election and within few days he changed his decision Announced the formation of the NDA government
 BJP ko lagata tha ki mukesh kii mallaah votaron main kaafii lokapriyata he or unka nitish kumaar ke prati jo jhukaav he use todane main vah kaamayaab honge
 Perhaps this was the reason why the BJP national president kept Mukesh with him in around 40 meetings
 vah unhen apane saath har din helicopter main le jate the or donon sanyukt sabha ko sambodhit karte the
 But when the election results came, BJP leaders said that Mallah voters were more inclined towards Nitish Kumar and relying on Mukesh like Kushwaha was not beneficial
 upi main mahagathbandhan kaa ganit : congress se haath milakar sapa-basapa kar sakati hai bijepi kaa safayamukesh saahani ke bare main kaha jaataa he ki ye bombai main film ke set banane kaa kaam karte hai or us dhandhe main inhone kaafii acchhee kamai kii
 But he has always had political ambitions due to which he has been very active in Bihar since the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 lekin 2015 ke vidhansabha chunaav main NDA kii haar ke baad wo phir waapas mumbai chale gaye lekin pichley ek varsh se bihar kii raajnneeti main phir sakriy hue hai
 He takes every step to mobilize and attract voters of his caste, whether it is a way of campaigning by helicopter or his style of campaigning in special chariots in the district and towns
 lekin ravivaar ko jaise ki mukesh ne ghoshnaa kii he ki mach bhaat khaaenge or mahagathabandhan ko jitaayenge or agar endie dohare ank main pahunch gaya to raajnneeti nahin karenge, usase lagata he ki unhone apane liye kathin lakshya rakhaa he
 More than that, they have to prove that they have influence over the voters of their caste

" 
 
 manushyon kii galatiyon ke kaaran kisi bandar ko ksht nahin hona chahie

 unka daawa he ki chunmun ke aane se unke jivan main saubhaahgya or khushhaali ai he
 
 
 Well, no one believes it or not, small part, the owner of a part of Rae Bareli will now be a monkey
