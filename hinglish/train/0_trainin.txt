 twitor par unke folunron kii sankhya 50 lakh ke kareeb pahunchane vaali he, jabaki fasebuk par unke pej ko like karne waalon kii sankhya 20 lakh ke kareeb pahunch chuki he
 In the midst of all this, he is having a romance with Bollywood star actress Anushka Sharma and the warm heart with which Virat Kohli has known this relationship has become his special style
 srilanka ke khilaaf vanade mukaable main shatak banane ke baad bat ke jariye anoushka tak ‘kis’ bhejne kaa yah style chaunkaane vaala tha
 When Kohli repeated this style in Melbourne, it became clear that Kohli is representing the younger generation who wants to express their desires in their own way
 darasal, viraat kohli kaa har kadam kamyaabi bharaa sabit ho rahaa he, vigyaapan ke bhartiya bazaar main bhi unki dhooma he
 The boom is such that London-based Sports Pro magazine ranked him second in the world in the most marketable sportsstar of 2014
 aise main aane vaale saal main sabaki nazren viraat kohli par tiki hongi
 The way he has batted strongly in the Test series against Australia, it is evident that his bat will be seen in the new year too, but the biggest thing in this series was that he can play the most difficult challenge of captaincy
 He is all set to captain the Test as well
 australia ke khilaaf test siries ke pehle mukaable main kohli team india ke captain ke taur par utre
 This was the first time in his career when he was captaining the Test
 edilade test kii pehali pari main unhone 115 ran thok die or duusari pari main team india ko ek avismaraneey jeet dilaane ke kareeb pahunchane vaali pari main unhone 141 ran bana daale
 Kohli's team lost by 48 runs in front of a mammoth target of 364 runs
 lekin kohli ne yah dikhaaya ki test mukaable main jis aakraamak najariye kii captaini chahie hoti he, vah unamem maujuud he
 While making his Test captaincy, Kohli has shown the charisma to score a century in both innings
 is mukaam tak pahunchane vaale vah duniya ke mahaj duusare captain bane
 Earlier, Australian captain Greg Chappell showed this feat against Brisbane in 1975 against the West Indies
 lekin usase bhi badi baat yah rahi ki unhone team india ke ballebaajon ko ek mushkil chunauti kaa peechha karne kaa hausala diya
 On the occasions so far in odis, Kohli has captained the team in 17 matches and Team India won in 14 matches
 vanade cricket main mahaj 136 maichon main 6,000 ran tak pahunchane kaa karishma bhi unhone 2014 main hi puraa kiya he
 In such a situation, the demand for handing over the command of Team India in place of Mahendra Singh Dhoni is gaining momentum
 videshi pichon par dhoni kii captaini main team india kii lagaataar haar se ab team kii captaini viraat kohli se bahut dur bhi nahin dikh rahi he
 In their path, there may be just a bottleneck, if Team India won the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand under the captaincy of Mahendra Singh Dhoni, then the demand to remove Dhoni from the captaincy would automatically end
 haalanki sambhav to yah bhi he ki dhoni bharat ke sabase kaamyaab captain ke taur par khud hi jagah khaali kar den
 Right now, off the cricket field and off the field, the coming year definitely looks like Virat Kohli
 pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne guuruuvaar ko loksabhaa main varsh 2013-14 ke liye pesh aam bajet kii prashansa kii or kaha ki kendriya vitt mantri ne saraahneey kaary kiya he
 Manmohan Singh said that the Finance Minister has done commendable work by keeping the deficit limited and at the same time focusing on the needs of development
 unhone kaha ki 12veen yojana avadhi ke dauraan hamen har saal ek karod naukariyaan paidaa karne kii jarurat he
 This target can be achieved only if we achieve eight percent gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate

 Mukherjee Nagar is an anonymous area of north Delhi
 yah shaayad hi kabhi akhabaaron kii surkhiyaan batorta ho, lekin pichley ek maheene se yah ilaaka desh bhar main charchit ho gaya he
 Here and in its neighboring mohallas like Nehru Vihar, Gandhi Vihar and Indira Vihar, almost every house houses young men and women preparing for civil service examination
 inamen se zyaadaatar hindi madhyam se is pariksha main baithte hai
 For at least the last 25 years, this area has been known as the hub of IAS preparation
 yahaan rahakar taiyaari kar rahe noujvaan aam taur par shant, saumy or padhaaku maane jate hai
 In 25 years, it has never happened that these youth have shown the terror of their crowd or muscle power to the local people
 lekin aajkal ye yuva behad naaraaz hai
 The resentment is that about 10,000 of these young men suddenly hit the streets on the morning of 27 June and have not returned to their rooms since
 rajghat, india get or rescorse tak kii lambii padayatraaon ke alaava candal march, aamaran anshan jaise na jane kitne upaay apana chuke hai lekin haar maanane ko taiyaar nahin hai
 Twice, the government's promise of Khilafi or dictatorship also forced them to lose their restraint and during this time the police were seen burning in the area from gypsy to DTC buses and motorcycles
 haalia khabar yah he ki yah andolan is mohalle tak simit na rahakar kam yaa zyada maatra main elahabaad, lakhanu, banaras, patna, bhopal, jaipur, mumbai, hyderabad or guwahati tak fail gaya he
 The question is with whom and why are these youths angry? The truth is that they are angry with both UPSC and Government of India
 inkaa daawa he ki upiessi ne ek sajeesh ke tahat inke saath bhashaayi bhedbhaav karte hue inkaa sapana chin liya he
 Although this conspiracy had been going on for the last 2-3 years, but the final result of the 2013 examination completely exposed it
 bataa den ki jahaan pichley kai saal se antim nateezon main hindi madhyam ke ummidavaaron kii bhagidaari 10-15 fisadi hoti thi, vahiin 2013 ke nateezon main yah ghatakar 2-3 fisadi ke bich rah gai he
 Almost the same is also in the rest of the Indian languages like Tamil, Telugu and Bangla
 vivaad kii jad yah he ki 2011 main upiessi ne pro

 Based on the recommendations of the Khanna Committee, the structure of the Civil Services Preliminary Examination was changed
 pehle is pariksha main do prashnptr hote the—300 ankon kaa vaikalpik vishay or 150 ankon kaa saamaanya adhyayan
 Candidates used to choose an elective from a large list, their background or interest, and because of their serious study, they succeeded in the preliminary examination
 is paddati main har vishay se ek nishchit pratishat main ummidavaar safal hote the, isliye har vishay ke utkrisht chaatro ko safal hone kaa bharosa rahata tha
 Overall, there was a 'sense of proposition' which often did not leave any room for doubt
 saal 2011 main khanna samiti kii siforeeshon ke aadhaar par lagu kiye nae pattern main upiessi ne praarambhik pariksha se vaikalpik vishay ko hataa diya or nayaa paper laga diya jise 'sisat’ (civil services aptitude test) kehete hai
 The result of this new structure is that where Hindi medium candidates (40 to 45 per cent of the candidates who appeared in the main examination before 2011) passed the preliminary examination, it was reduced to 15-16 per cent from 2011
 She left
 kamobesh yahi haalat baaki bhartiya bhashaaon jaise tamil, marathi or punjabi ke ummidavaaron kii bhi hui
 For example, if you compare the number of candidates appearing in the main examination in 2008 and 2011, it has come down from 98 in Tamil to 14, in Telugu from 114 to 29 and in Kannada from 14 to 5, while at the same time the English medium main examination
 Number of recipients 51
 6 fisadi se badhkar 82
 9 percent
 swaabhaavik taur par bhartiya bhashaaon ke ummidavaaron ko mahasoos hone laga ki ab ve praarambhik pariksha paas karne ke laayak bhi nahin rahe hai
 Some aristocratic intellectuals, media workers and bureaucrats commenting on this problem with shallowness are bent on proving that their candidates' failure is due to their disqualification
 yah ek shaatiranaa jhooth he
 The truth is that this crisis is rooted not in the perceived ineptitude of these students, but in the discrimination inherent in the exam pattern
 udhaaharan ke liye, sisat ke kul 80 main se 8-9 sawaal sirf angreji main puche jate hai jinka kul vettege 20 se 22
 It is 5 digits
 convent skulon ke chaatro ke liye ye sawaal behad aasaan hai jabaki sarkari skulon se padhe gramin or gaiyr-angreji bhashiyon ke liye kathin
 The problem is that if two questions are wrong from anyone, then 5 marks will be deducted, besides 1 due to negative marking
 67 ank or cat jaaenge
 In this paper, 30–35 questions are asked to test comprehension ability but their Hindi translation is in another language (eg Cloud Computing for Cloud Computing, Credit Based Education System for Credit Based Education System, Tablet Computer Economic recovery for tablet computers and Land Reforms)
 pareshaani kaa sabab yah he ki agar hindi kaa chaatr aisi abujh bhashaa padhakar jawaab dena chaahe to 8-10 sawaal galat hona tay he
 If he looks at the English questions in search of the right meaning, then some questions can be missed due to lack of time
 nichod yah ki jis pariksha main galakat spardhaa kii vajah se ek-ek ank ke antar se saikadon ummidavaar baahar ho jate hai, usamen bhartiya bhashaaon ke ummidavaaron ko lagbhag 20-30 ankon kaa nuksaan uthaane ke liye majaboor kiya gaya
 Today UPSC is avoiding it by calling it a wrong translation, neither did they take cognizance of this problem on their part nor did they compensate for the loss of these students
 saamaanya adhyayan paper ke prashn jaan-boojhkar itane mushkil banaae jane lage ki shaayad hi koi 100 main se 60-65 se zyada sahi kar sake jabaki sisat ke paper kaa str aisa rakhaa gaya ki angreji or takneekee gyaan main paarangat ummidavaar aasaani se 80 main se 70 ke kareeb (kabhi-kabhi to 79-80 bhi) prashn hal kar len
 a question of General Studies is of two marks whereas CSAT has 2 marks
 5 ankon kaa
 Since merit is determined by adding the marks of both the papers, it is the effect that since 2011, the economic-social background of the candidates who have qualified in this exam has changed
 swayan upiessi kii gathit nigavekar samiti kaa akalan he ki ''sisat shahari kshetron ke angreji madhyam ke pratiyogiyon ko phayda pahunchaata he or gramin kshetra ke pratiyogiyon ke liye mushkilen paidaa karata he
 "the question is, what are the students who want to agitate for? Are they against English and globalization? Are they looking for an excuse to cover their disqualification? No
 bilkul nahin
 They are only against linguistic discrimination
 jaraa inke tarkon par gaur kiijie:ek acha civil sevak banane ke liye sirf angreji kaa gyaan chahie yaa bhartiya bhashaa kaa bhi? kothaari ayog ne sifarish kii thi ki praarambhik pariksha main ek paper angreji kaa ho or ek bhartiya bhashaa kaa, tathaa donon kaa vajan baraabar ho
 The Nigwekar committee gave the same advice regarding the main examination
 khanna samiti ke alaava sabhi samitiyaan is prashn par ekamat dikhaai padati hai ki civil sevakon ko donon bhashaaon main sakasham hona chahie
 If this is the case then why only English language questions are asked in CSAT? Why not put 8-9 questions that are asked only in Indian languages and their English translation should not be given? If it is not approved by UPSC, then only English questions should be removed
 aakhir mukhya pariksha main to angreji kaa qualifing paper 1979 se hi sabhi ko paas karnaa hota he
 In the questions asked in both languages, why should Hindi people have to face the problem of battling translation? Why not do it so that the Hindi text is considered original and questions should be asked by translating it into English? Imagine if Ram went to sparrows home and the success of the English speakers is to be decided by this language, will the English intellectuals avoid this issue as easily as it is avoiding today? It is not advisable to remove such questions from the CSAT on the basis of linguistic inequality? The Nigvekar Committee of the UPSC itself has commented about the translation that "the translation done from English is of machine type"

 Mathematics, Reasoning, Decision making and Data Interpretation have no problem, but their ratio should not be such that students from one background get illegitimate benefit
 saaf he ki andolankariyon ke ye tark kamjor nahin hai
 The government and UPSC should either dismiss these arguments in a concrete manner, or else it is necessary that the structure of the preliminary examination be changed
 yah andolan sirf sisat or praarambhik pariksha ke liye nahin he
 There is well planned discrimination with Indian languages in the main examination and also interview
 masalan, mukhya pariksha ke saamaanya adhyayan ke chaaron peparon kii jaanch ke liye model jawaab sirf angreji main hote hai
 Answer books of Indian languages are evaluated on the basis of them
 agar upiessi main naitik saahas he to use kisi bhi saal kii bhashaavar ank talika jari kerani chahie
 It will be clear from this that the candidates of Indian languages have to lose an average of 15-25 marks in almost every paper
 isi tarah, saakshaatkaar main bhi bhashaayi bhedbhaav dikhaai padataa he
 Candidates in Hindi, Tamil, Bangla or other Indian languages are forced to give interviews in English, but till date no one has heard that an English speaking candidate has been pressurized to give interviews in an Indian language
 agar upiessi sachmuch paardarshita kaa sammaan karti he to use bhashaavar vargeekaran ke saath kisi bhi saal ke intervyuu ke ank ghoshit karne chahie taaki sach saamne aa sake
 It can be claimed that on average this difference will not be less than 20-25 points
 (lekhak hindi madhyam se chaynit purv civil sevak hai) Today 'king Khan' of Bollywood turns 51 years old

 But later it became clear that NSUI won two posts and ABVP won two posts

 In the initial round, ABVP had an edge over all four positions, then later NSUI took the lead
 pichley saal abivipi ne dusu ke central panel main 4 main se 3 siton par kabza jamaaya tha
 Let us know that ABVP has been under DUSU for the last 4 years
 chaar saal baad kii vapasidusu ke is dangal main enesayuai pichley 4 saal se haar kaa saamana kar rahi thi
 After 4 years, NSUI has taken over the post of president and vice-president

 NSUI hopes to win DUSU this year, but NSUI had to campaign for the second candidate Alka after the nomination of nsui's President, Candidate Tusid, just before the election

 Northern Ireland's adventurer Bayer Grylls and India's prime minister Narendra Modi's special adventure man VS Wilde got to see people
 desh hi nahin balki videsh main bhi is special episod ko logon ne dekha
 In this episode, PM Modi not only talked about environmental protection
 balki logon ke saamne ye sandesh bhi rakhaa ki paryaavaran kaa sangrakshan aane vaali janareshan ke liye kitna mahatvapurn he or insaan ko apane swaarth se aage badhkar maanavtaa ke bare main sochna chahie
 PM Modi appeared in a different style during this show
 piem modi ne raft kaa sahaara lekar nadi paar kii
 During this, Grylls was pulling the raft and PM Modi was sitting in the raft
 himalay ke thande pani kii vajah se grills kii haalat kharaab ho gai thi
 He shared this with PM Modi
 piem modi paryaavaran ko lekar bhi kaaphi samvedansheel hai or is bare main apane vichaar saajha karte najar aae
 This was once again seen when Grylls told him that Jim Corbett was a very dangerous area
 is par piem modi ne jawaab dete hue kaha ki ''agar prakruti se sangharsh karoge, nechar ke khilaaf rahoge to aapako sab kuch khatarnaak lagegaa
 Then you will also find humans dangerous
 lekin agar aap prakruti ke saath hai, use pyaar karte hai or use bachaane kii koshish karte hai to junglee jaanavar bhi aapkaa saath dete hai
 During this show, PM Modi also talks on environmental security and explains why it is important for humans to survive
 ye special episod duniya ke kai deshon main dikhaaya gaya
 It was broadcast in 8 Indian languages
 inamen hindi, tamil, telugu, kannada, malayalam or marathi jaisi bhashaaen pramukhataa se shaamil raheen
 Rejecting the internal infighting that has been emerging in the BJP for the last few days, the country's major opposition party on Tuesday insisted that there is no internal fighting going on in its house and it is completely united
 bhaajapa ke rashtriya pravaktaa prakaash jaavdekar ne party ke bhitari matbhedon ke sawaalon par kaha, ‘bhaajapa main koi andruni ladaai nahin chal rahi he
 We are fully united and powerful
 ’ unhone daawa kiya ki bhaajapa janata ke bich he or agle aam chunaavon main rashtriya janatantric gathbandhan (endie) kii aguwai karte hue sarkaar banane kii takat rakhti he
 Javadekar tried to sidestep the news of the earthquake in the BJP with the recent blog of former Deputy Prime Minister LK Advani, in which the party was advised 'self-determination'
 unhone kaha, ‘adwani hamaare sabase varisht netaa hai
 He speaks from time to time
 unhone blog main jo baat rakhi, vahi baat party kii rashtriya kaarysmiti kii mumbai main yojit pichhali baithak main bhi rakhi thi
 There is nothing new in it
 ’jaavdekar ne ek sawaal par kaha ki bhaajapa adhyaksh nitin gadakari ke yoga guru baba ramdev ke pair chune ke siyaasi myne nahin nikaale jane chaiye
 He said, 'it was a general greeting to show respect to the elders
 ’adwani or gadakari main aapasi tanaav kii haalia khabaron ke bich donon netaaon kii aaj subah hui mulaakaat par bhaajapa pravaktaa ne kaha, ‘donon netaa aksar milte hai
 Gadkari went to meet Advani to invite his son to be married on June 24
 ’jaavdekar ne bhaajapa kii rashtriya kaaryakarini se istipha dene vaale sanjay joshi ke samarthan main dilli or ahmedabad main lagaaye gayi postaron par anbhigyata jataayi
 He refused to say anything about this despite being asked repeatedly
 joshi ko gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi kaa kattar siyaasi virdohi mana jaataa he
 The BJP spokesperson also deferred the question of Modi's possible candidature for the post of Prime Minister from the party
 unhone kaha, ‘nirvachan ayog ke agle aam chunaavon kii ghoshnaa karne tak intjaar kijiye
 When asked about the bjp's current strategy for the upcoming presidential election, he said, "first let the Congress declare its candidate for President
 ham iske baad is chunaav ke bare main hamaara rukh spasht karenge
 ' chunavi prachaar ke dauraan netaaon kii jubaan aksar phisalati rahati he or kai baar ye unke liye musiibat bhi ban jaataa he
 Something similar happened with Bharatiya Janata Party leader Ashok Vajpayee
 jab vah bijepi ke liye vot maangate hue apni puraani party ke chunavi chinh kaa zikr kar baithe
 In a meeting held in Hardoi, Ashok Vajpayee said that by pressing the cycle button, make Narendra Modi once again the Prime Minister
 ravivaar ko hardoi kii jansabha main ashok vaajapeyi ne kaha, ‘’
 
 
 On the morning of April 29, reaching the booth to vote, press Modi's bicycle and give Modi ji

 chunaav kii har khabar milegi sidhe aapke inbox main
 To stay updated with the latest news of the general election, subscribe to the Election News Special Newsletter pyaar ke haseen palonko yaadgaar koun nahin bananaa chahta
 As important as it is to know what to do during that, it is equally important to be aware of what not to do
 un najuk lamhon main koi bhi galati majaa kirkira kar sakati he
 These are the 9 things that you absolutely should not do during those moments
 1
 How to avoid kissing: You are not in a hurry while making love to your partner
 kai log pyaar ke un palon main apane saathi ko bilkul nahin chuumate hai
 Many times your position is such that it becomes difficult to kiss, sometimes people consider kissing as breaking the rhythm
 choomanaa jitna forple ke dauraan jaruri he utana hi last stage ke dauraan bhi
 2
 chhuo magar pyaar se:yun tolav bite, pyaar kii ek khubasurat nishaani hoti he
 But for this it is important that you prepare your partner first
 aapkaa saathi taiyaar na ho or aap uske jism par daant ukerne lage to bahut sambhav he ki use aapse koft hone lage yaa pyaar se hi dar lagane lage
 Both situations are bad
 3
 Where is your meditation: Some people converge exactly like Arjun and do intercourse
 aapkaa saathi ye chahta he ki uske jism ke har hisse ko aap tavajjo den
 If you are going to swallow only one part, then in those delicate moments of love, you may suddenly start looking selfish
 4
 Don't put your burden on the partner: There is nothing wrong in wanting to get too close to the partner during love making
 is dauraan agar aap apane saathi ke upar aa jate hai to yah jarur dhyaan rakhen ki sharir kaa puraa vajan us par na daal den
 If in your love affair, if he starts having trouble even breathing, then believe the truth, the partner will give priority to saving his life more than love
 5
 Especially for men: if the early work is done by the devil, then there is no use to delay
 aap kitni der main nidhaal hona chaahate hai iskaa faisla karte vakt apane saathi kaa bhi khyaal rakhen
 If you are not able to satisfy him in a hurry, you will bother him by staying up late
 6
 Reaching the climax without telling: Love has a relationship with sharing and caring
 yah dhyaan rakhana aapaki jimmedaari he ki donon charam par pahunche or pyaar kii barish main baraabar sarobaar hon
 For this, it is very important that you tell your partner how soon you are going to reach the end of this game so that it is also ready
 7
 This film is also not good: if you are very fond of that type of films and keep trying all the rugs shown in them, then do ask your partner once
 kahi aisa na ho aapke zyada noti hone se aapkaa saathi khafa ho jaae
 8
 kuch to kaho:pyaar ke un palon mendhimi aawaaj main kuch mulaayam si batenkarne main aapkaa kya jaataa he bhala
 Your long silence can make the environment cumbersome
 is dauraan saathi kii thodi si tarif bhi jaadu sa asar karegi
 9
 masini pyaar:pyaar karne or gym main kasarat karne main kuch fark to hona hi chahie
 If you are not trying anything new during love, then soon you will start getting bored with it
 yah aap donon ke liye buree khabar he

 One leader of this alliance claims that the opposition parties are working together to formulate a joint economic plan
 yah saaf sanket he ki aagaamee chunaavon main pradhanmantri narendra modi ke virodh main puraa vipaksh ekajute hone kii taiyaari main he
 Former Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister and TDP leader Chandrababu Naidu said in an interview to Reuters that the opposition's plan is likely to include the minimum income program proposed by the main opposition Congress

 5 years of Modi government, near or failing to handle financial losses? Chandrababu Naidu said, 'many political parties are working on building consensus
 kisaanon kii samasya behad gambhir mudda he or berogari sabase bada mudda he
 Therefore, there is a need to focus on the economy

 On the question of the prime ministerial candidate, Naidu said that 'the Prime Minister will be selected by consensus after the results as the first priority of the coalition is to win big in the elections
 ’sarkari khajaane main yahaan se aayaa paisa or yahaan hua kharchagauratlab he ki naidu ne bataur andhra pradesh ke mukhyamantri rajya main kaarobaari sugamawa ke kshetra main acha kaam karte hue microsoft jaisi company ko rajya main nivesh ke liye taiyaar kiya tha
 Naidu's TDP is one of the larger regional parties in the Parliament and as of March 2018 she was in the ruling NDA but dropped out of the coalition demanding a special package for Andhra Pradesh
 iske baad se naidu ne modi sarkaar ko satta se baahar karne ke liye kshetreey dalon ko ekajute karne kii muhim shuru kii he
 Naidu says that no other leader will be better than Modi because Narendra Modi does not listen to anyone

 is hatyakand main pehle police ko shaq tha ki is hatya ke peeche koi padosi yaa sambandhi ho saktaa he
 Or it may be a story of illicit relations
 lekin baad main hakeekat saamne aane par yah maamla surkhiyon main aa gaya tha
 Sonu, that day when you saw me singing in the video as a beggar, the mind was happy to see that a great singer like you is singing among your loved ones on the streets
 shaayad unamem se kisi ne bhi kabhi tumhaara live concert nahin suna hoga
 The boy who sold vegetables on the cart, had camped there
 lekin shaayad asli fain aise hi hote hai jo tumhen casette main bharkar din-raat sunen
 Only one can go to the concert
 vaise iske baad tumhen bhi to anubhav hua hoga ki agar kisi ke saath uski popularity nahin he, uski sahi pahchaan nahin he to log ansuna karke chale jate hai
 Yes, you would have been deprived of this experience if only you could sing and people would have flocked to your autograph more than listening to your songs
 tum to iske aadi bhi hoge
 In the video you said that you disguised and sang because you wanted to make people aware of those street singers
 par is man kaa kya karun jisamen tumhaare is kadam ke baad, ek saath kai sawaal uth rahe hai
 According to me, it is good to spread awareness and there is a great need to create awareness about many issues in our society
 sonu, tumse mere sawaal hai ki kya vaaki yah video tumne un bin siikhe, god gifted, sureele singrs ke liye awarenes creat karne ke liye banaaya tha? kya asal main yah tumhaara koi publicity stant to nahin tha? kya tumne bhi sirf khabaron main bane rahane ke liye aisa to nahin kiya?agar tumhaara jawaab ‘naa’ main he, to phir to mere sawaalon kii list or bhi lambii ho jaati he
 Like the people you are expecting to spend some time out of their busy time listening to those street singers
 unamem se adhiktar to asal main shaayad roji-roti kii jaddojehad main lage honge or bhaag-daud kar rahe honge
 And maybe you will not be active on social media to see this message
 sabji vaala bhaiya, factory main kaam karne vaala koi majdoor yaa ghar main kaam karne vaali maid, mujhe nahin lagata ki inamen se kuch logon ne bhi tumhaara yah video dekha hoga
 However, many of these people must have stayed to listen to a street singer singing on the street
 lekin tumhaara video dekh kar nahin balki shaayad isliye ki unamem se koi singer tumhaara koi superhit gaanaa ga rahaa hoga
 Sonu, if your answer is 'yes', then i complain more to you
 kya tum nahin jaanate ki tum‘da sonu nigam’ho
 Have you forgotten that you are a legend singer Sonu Nigam who has been ruling the hearts of crores of people like me for 20 years
 tum wo sonu nigam ho jisane rafee sahab ko sahi myanon main jinda rakhaa he
 You are the Sonu Nigam who gave us Evergreen songs like 'deewana Tera', 'ab Mujh Raat Din', 'dil Se', 'har Ghadi'
 tum wo sonu nigam ho jisane apane kariyar main gaae har ek gane ke saath insaaf kiya he
 And i am not just saying this, it will say every person who has ever heard you

 But perhaps it will not help them
 aisa to nahin he ki aaj ke baad se un singrs ko kaam milane lagegaa
 And it is not as if the video gets a few lakh likes, it will create a feeling in the minds of people about a singer singing on the street
 khayr, sach maano, tumhaara yah video dekhakar mujhe to ek fain ke taur par khushi hui he lekin desh kii ek tarksangat or jaagruk naagarik hone ke naate kuch kami bhi mahasoos ho rahi he

 Some consider it purely his autobiographical work, but the agnostic himself says that it is not 'self-biographical'

 The agnostic comment about Shekhar, the protagonist of this novel, is marked by the intense and impassioned emotionality of a person shaping his time-society and his own identity with multidimensional and synthetic characters: 'shekhar is no big man Ha, he is not even a good man

 Literature on the death anniversary of Sachchidananda Hiranand Vatsyayan 'agyeya', one of the most intellectually considered writers of our era, for the readers of Aaj Tak, part of his classic work 'shekhar: Ek Biography' courtesy of publisher Rajkamal Publications - *** *** Book excerpt: Shekhar: a biographer has sent me flowers
 yadi dhoop or chhaanh ek-duusare ke paripurak hai, to kyon in phulon ko dekhakar yah bhaavana nahin jaagti, kyon is kothri ke paanch kadam lambe or teen kadam chaude, lohe kii kadiyon se ghire hue andhkaar ke tukade main, mujhe in phulon ko dekhakar sampoornataa kaa bhaan nahin hota, kyon inke bikhare-bikhare safed soundarya main khuli-khuli si pili ankhen dekhakar mujhe atyant apurti, akhand shoonyata kaa anubhav hota he! kyon mere andar ek utkar vidroh, ek sarvanaashak jigyaasa jaagti he
 
 
 Today, i feel the shock that the song has been sung, the person who has sent these flowers, what must she understand what she sent me, what scorches me, but for which i am still thankful to her! Was a disciple, but i was not his teacher
 main use keval padhaata hi tha, par vah mujhe kabhi guru nahin samaj pai, uske liye main tha ek bada-sa bhai- kintu aisa bhai jisase prem kiya ja sake, jis par jhukaa ja sake, jiske aadhaar par swapn bune ja saken- or jo upeksha se unhen tod de!main padhaata tha, badi mehnat se padhaata tha
 But she could not learn anything! i always ask him, 'have you missed the previous lesson?' Then she bowed her head and kept a silent smile and kept quiet
 tab main baar-baar poochta tha, phir daant detaa tha, or kahata tha, 'aise padhai nahin ho sakati
 And used to repeat the old lesson
 tab vah bilkul nahin padhati thi
 Keeping the book in front, she used to look at it with great pity, with eyes that were filled with big drops and could not see anything
 
 
 tab main sneh ke (kintu bahut thode se sneh ke!) swar main kahata tha, 'acha aaj aage padhaa detaa hoon
 Remember both lessons tomorrow! And she used to study
 or duusare din phir vahi haal!ek din mujhe bahut krodh aayaa
 Seeing her tearful eyes, i said in a livid voice, 'if you read and write, nothing happens, and if i say something, you cry! Move tomorrow i will not come

 i never say anything for fear of studying! Why, don't you read well? 'I really wanted to say, but i said,' No, she does study, but read for a little more then- 'she went away

 Then one day it came that i did not go to teach him
 do din nahin, teen din nahin
 On the fourth day i wrote a letter to her father that i would not be able to read
 unhone duusare hi din ek check mere naam bhej diya
 The story ended

 They have called

 If i could have told her the truth that i had denied it, then perhaps she would have been comforted by considering herself a victim of injustice, i have not left any room for her and since then her insolent shadow comes with me and weeps

 But today i have forgotten myself

 i tied them to my closet jungle, but did not see a piece of ribbon tying them, these soft white flowers studded with black iron batches, reminiscently of a big immovable truth

 They are shedding their long-lost armaments, because their purpose has become a smoke of an explosion

 They are all silent, Bhairavi, who completes this scene, is ringing in a silent voice somewhere in her place
 
 
 yahi he us kavi-hriday sipaahi kii antyeshti, us vidrohi ke vidroh kaa antim ufaan
 The scene fades
 ek nissim shwet akaash main padaa hua rah jaataa he keval vah sharir jamate hue rakt ke ek chappad main
 
 
 Two sizes on either side of it - a woman and a man
 ve ek-duusare ko dekh rahe hai, unki ankhen neeche pade us shav ko nahin dekhti, unke hriday nahin anubhav karte ki ve kisi bhavy pavitrataa kii samadhi bhrasht kar rahe hai
 They meet, surround each other with arms and tie them, embrace a giant with hunger and cross the same body! Confusion again! i see a bunch of dried Nargis hanging from the jungle and a piece of lace surrounding it

 Historically, in China, the policy of "one child" was counted, but today the figures of abortion are increasing from the youth population
 china main 2014 main jitne bhi garbhpaat hue, usamen 62 pratishat un ladakiyon ne karaae jinaki umr 20 se 29 saal ke bich he, jo adhiktar avivaahit hai or jinke upar parivaar niyojan kii bandish lagu nahin hoti
 According to government studies, one reason for this is the lack of awareness in schools and universities about sex and contraception (see box)
 china ke shikshavid lambey samay se is dharna ke pairokaar rahe hai ki sex shiksha kii vajah se bachche sex karne ke liye prerit hote hai
 a series of sexual harassment cases in primary schools in central Henan province last year forced people to rethink this notion and spark a new debate
 uske baad se kuch skulon main sex shiksha kii classes chalaai jane lagi hai
 Popular radio host Qing Yin, who broadcast a weekly program on relationships, says, "most of the youth in China have not yet been taught how to deal with issues related to sex
" ’’ har hafte is kaarykram main salaah ke liye hajaaron yuvaaon ke phone aate hai
 "youngsters are more open now than they were in the last five or ten years," says Qing, a trained psychologist and an NGO running for desperate youths, but their minds are still occupied by stereotypes and they cannot talk about sex before marriage 
 yah bahut badi samasya he
 "ma has made this topic his concern (and obviously, it's good business too)
" twitor ke chini sanskaran vibo microblog par maa ke teen lakh foloar hai or ve unhen isi madhyam se sandesh bhejti hai
 His posts not only contain awareness messages about contraception and for the LGBT community, on the pretext, their products are also marketed
 ab unki aawaaj suni jane lagi he (maa ke aadhe se zyada karmchaaree samalangik hai)
 However, there have been many obstacles in his journey
 unhone pehali dukaan apane shikshan santhaan communication university of china ke baahar kholi thi
 For this his friends paid 20 lakhs
 jutaaye the or vishvavidhyalay community se ise sahyog mila tha, par ise lekar bujurgon main andeh tha
 In this way, people got torn between the shop
 kuch bhram bhi fail rahe hai jinaki vajah se atpati ghatnaayen saamne aa jaati hai
 For example, once a 75-year-old elderly man walked into the shop looking at a shirt hanging on the window that read, "I am a good comrade
" ’’ chini yuvaaon main commered kaa sambodhan samalangik vyaktiyon ke liye he
 The elderly communist was not aware of this, so he said, "I am happy that young people are spreading such a great message
 ’’ unhone apane mitron ke liye kuch darjan shart kaa order de daalaa

 iske baad peedita ko lakhanu ke aspataal main bhartee karaayaa gaya tha
 When the victim's condition did not improve in Lucknow, she was airlifted to Delhi and admitted to Safdarjung Hospital
 haalanki unnav kii beti ko bachaaya nahin ja sakaa

 Avoiding being dismissed for the first ball in the first ODI against Australia, George Belicke said that the presence of DRS would have made the Indians' appeal on the first ball during the first ODI against them interesting
 tab match main do wicket kho chuki australian team ke liye ampire dwaara beli ko out nahin diya janaa behad nirnaayak sabit hua or antat match mejabaan ke paksh main chalaa gaya
 Rohit Sharma's unbeaten 171 not out on Waka's flat pitch went in vain as Australia won the first match of the five-match ODI series with the help of captain Steve Smith's 149 and Bailey's 112

 The Delhi High Court on Monday dismissed the petition related to the suicide of the late Chief Minister of Arunachal Pradesh, Kalikho Pul
 yachika main is maamle main exiaar darj karne kii maang kii gai thi
 2 on the National Lawyers Campaign for Judicial Transparency and Reform, the petitioning agency
 75 lakh kaa jurmaana bhi lagaaya he
 What did the court say? The court was of the view that the petitioner also did not consider it necessary to check the veracity of the suicide note
 unhone na kabhi note kii mul copy dekhi na use paane kii koshish kii
 The petition was filed only on the basis of half-incomplete information from social media

 desh ke sabase bade medical santhaan ames se jari hua ek press release bataati he ki swasthya mantri jepi nadda ke kareebi or bhrashtachar ke aaropon main ghire ek adhikari ko bachaane kii koshish ho rahi he
 The case is of 1982 batch IAS officer Vineet Chaudhary who faces serious allegations of serious irregularities and corruption of crores of rupees within AIIMS
 saal bhar pehle hi vineet choudhary ke khilaaf chargeshit ko khud tab swasthya mantri rahe dow
 Harshvardhan gave the green signal, but the BJP government has not taken any action on that chargesheet so far
 lekin ab khud ames kii is press release se pataa chalaa he ki swasthya mantralay ne ames ke nideshak em si mishra se kaha he ki vah dekhen ki vineet choudhary par lage aarope kisi karrwai ke laayak hai yaa nahin
 The AIIMS press release also stated that according to the current CVO of the institute, there is no 'vigilance angle' in the allegations against Vineet Chaudhary, that is, there is no need for investigation
 ames main dipti diarector rah chuke vineet choudhary par daayar chargeshit ko lekar pehle hi kaaphi vivaad ho chukaa he
 In fact, many cases of corruption link up with Vineet Chaudhary
 jinka khulaasa purv sivio sanjeev chaturvedi ne kiya jinhen baad main ames ke sivio pad se hataa diya gaya
 NDTV India had shown you the news that Nadda, while an MP, wrote a letter to stop the investigation of these cases and asked for a new CVO of his choice in AIIMS
 ye baat bhi saamne ai he ki vineet choudhary par karrwai jepi nadda ke hari jhandi na dene kii vajah se hi nahin ho paa rahi he
 An NGO named Janhit Abhiyan appealed to the court accusing them of stopping the investigation into corruption cases, after which Health Minister Nadda himself was also given notice on behalf of the High Court on his personal status
 hycourt main die sivisi ke halafname se saaf hua he ki nadda kii anumati na milane kii vajah se ames main bhrashtachar ke maamalon kii jaanch rukii hua he
 So the question is arising whether the motive behind the attempt to save Vineet Chaudhary is to cover up all the cases of corruption in AIIMS
 ames ne apni press release main vineet choudhary ke paksh main daleel di he ki unhen ab tak chargeshit thamai nahin gai, isliye isamen lage aaropon par punarvichaar kiya ja rahaa he lekin sawaal yah bhi he ki pichley ek saal se is chargeshit ko thande baste main kyon rakhaa gaya
 The comments hairaan karne vaali baat yah he ki vineet choudhary kii chargeshit par punarvichaar ke liye november 2013 main bhi swasthya mantralay ne ames ke nideshak se kaha or tab bhi vartmaan nideshak em si mishra ne choudhary ke khilaaf aaropon ko sahi bataate hue chargeshit daayar karne kii anumati di
 Only after that the central Harshavardhan cleared the charge sheet against this officer
 ab sawaal ye he ki maujuuda swasthya mantri jepi nadda choudhary ke khilaaf karrwai ko kyon roke hue hai? It is clear that this case is not only about the corruption of the cases of corruption within AIIMS, but also of the dignity of the judiciary, because the cabinet minister of Modi government is trying to save the officer who is surrounded by all the allegations and The minister himself has been given notice in this regard from the court
 maamla 1982 batch ke iees adhikari vineet choudhary kaa he jin par ames ke bheetar gambhir gadabadiyon or karodon rupee ke bhrashtachar ke gambhir aarope hai
 The charge sheet against Vineet Chaudhary itself was then Health Minister
 harshavardhan ne hari jhandi di, lekin bijepi sarkaar ne ab tak us chargeshit par koi karrwai nahin kii he
 But now this press release of AIIMS itself has revealed that the Ministry of Health has asked MC Mishra, the director of AIIMS, to see if the allegations against Vineet Chaudhary deserve any action
 ames kii press release main ye bhi kaha gaya he ki santhaan ke maujuuda sivio ke mutabik vineet choudhary par lage aaropon main koi 'visilence angel' nahin he yani jaanch kii zarurat nahin he
 There has already been a lot of controversy over the charge sheet filed on Vineet Chaudhary, who was the deputy director in AIIMS
 asal main bhrashtachar ke kai maamalon ke taar vineet choudhary se judate hai
 These were disclosed by former CVO Sanjeev Chaturvedi who was later removed from the post of CVO of AIIMS
 enditivi india ne aapako khabar dikhaai thi ki saansad rahete nadda ne in maamalon kii jaanch rokane ke liye chitthee likhi or ames main apni pasand kaa nayaa sivio banaae jane ko kaha
 It has also come to light that action on Vineet Chaudhary is not being done due to JP Nadda not giving the green signal
 janhit abhiyaan naam kii enjio ne bhrashtachar ke maamalon kii jaanch rokane ke aarope lagaate hua court main apil kii, jiske baad nijee haisiyat par khud swasthya mantri nadda ko bhi hycourt kii ore se notice diya gaya
 The cvc's affidavit in the High Court has shown that due to non-approval of Nadda, investigation of corruption cases in AIIMS has stalled
 to sawaal uth rahaa he ki vineet choudhary ko bachaane kii koshish ke peeche kaa makasad kya ames main bhrashtachar ke tamaam maamalon par paradaa daalana he
 AIIMS in its press release has argued in favor of Vineet Chaudhary that he has not been handed over the charge sheet yet, hence the allegations in it are being reconsidered but the question is why this charge sheet has been put on hold for the last one year Kept
 tippaniyan The surprising thing is that in November 2013, the Health Ministry asked the Director of AIIMS to reconsider the charge sheet of Vineet Chaudhary and even then the current Director MC Mishra allowed the charge sheet to be filed against Chaudhary as correct
 
 uske baad hi kendriya harshavardhan is adhikari ke khilaaf chargeshit ko hari jhandi di
 Now the question is why the current Health Minister JP Nadda is stopping the action against Chaudhary? saaf he ki yah maamla sirf ames ke bheetar bhrashtachar ke maamalon kii lipa-potee kaa nahin he, balki nyaaypalika kii garima kaa bhi he, kyonki modi sarkaar ke cabinet mantri us afasar ko bachaane kii koshish kar rahe hai jo tamaam aaropon se ghira he or mantri ji ko khud is bare main court se notice diya ja chukaa he
 But now this press release of AIIMS itself has revealed that the Ministry of Health has asked MC Mishra, the director of AIIMS, to see if the allegations against Vineet Chaudhary deserve any action
 ames kii press release main ye bhi kaha gaya he ki santhaan ke maujuuda sivio ke mutabik vineet choudhary par lage aaropon main koi 'visilence angel' nahin he yani jaanch kii zarurat nahin he
 There has already been a lot of controversy over the charge sheet filed on Vineet Chaudhary, who was the deputy director in AIIMS

 enditivi india ne aapako khabar dikhaai thi ki saansad rahete nadda ne in maamalon kii jaanch rokane ke liye chitthee likhi or ames main apni pasand kaa nayaa sivio banaae jane ko kaha

 AIIMS in its press release has argued in favor of Vineet Chaudhary that he has not been handed over the charge sheet yet, hence the allegations in it are being reconsidered but the question is why this charge sheet has been put on hold for the last one year Kept
 tippaniyan The surprising thing is that in November 2013, the Health Ministry asked the Director of AIIMS to reconsider the charge sheet of Vineet Chaudhary and even then the current Director MC Mishra allowed the charge sheet to be filed against Chaudhary as correct
 
 uske baad hi kendriya harshavardhan is adhikari ke khilaaf chargeshit ko hari jhandi di
 Now the question is why the current Health Minister JP Nadda is stopping the action against Chaudhary? saaf he ki yah maamla sirf ames ke bheetar bhrashtachar ke maamalon kii lipa-potee kaa nahin he, balki nyaaypalika kii garima kaa bhi he, kyonki modi sarkaar ke cabinet mantri us afasar ko bachaane kii koshish kar rahe hai jo tamaam aaropon se ghira he or mantri ji ko khud is bare main court se notice diya ja chukaa he
 There has already been a lot of controversy over the charge sheet filed on Vineet Chaudhary, who was the deputy director in AIIMS
 asal main bhrashtachar ke kai maamalon ke taar vineet choudhary se judate hai
 These were disclosed by former CVO Sanjeev Chaturvedi who was later removed from the post of CVO of AIIMS
 enditivi india ne aapako khabar dikhaai thi ki saansad rahete nadda ne in maamalon kii jaanch rokane ke liye chitthee likhi or ames main apni pasand kaa nayaa sivio banaae jane ko kaha
 It has also come to light that action on Vineet Chaudhary is not being done due to JP Nadda not giving the green signal
 janhit abhiyaan naam kii enjio ne bhrashtachar ke maamalon kii jaanch rokane ke aarope lagaate hua court main apil kii, jiske baad nijee haisiyat par khud swasthya mantri nadda ko bhi hycourt kii ore se notice diya gaya

 Now the question is why the current Health Minister JP Nadda is stopping the action against Chaudhary? saaf he ki yah maamla sirf ames ke bheetar bhrashtachar ke maamalon kii lipa-potee kaa nahin he, balki nyaaypalika kii garima kaa bhi he, kyonki modi sarkaar ke cabinet mantri us afasar ko bachaane kii koshish kar rahe hai jo tamaam aaropon se ghira he or mantri ji ko khud is bare main court se notice diya ja chukaa he
 NDTV India had shown you the news that Nadda, while an MP, wrote a letter to stop the investigation of these cases and asked for a new CVO of his choice in AIIMS
 ye baat bhi saamne ai he ki vineet choudhary par karrwai jepi nadda ke hari jhandi na dene kii vajah se hi nahin ho paa rahi he
 An NGO named Janhit Abhiyan appealed to the court accusing them of stopping the investigation into corruption cases, after which Health Minister Nadda himself was also given notice on behalf of the High Court on his personal status
 hycourt main die sivisi ke halafname se saaf hua he ki nadda kii anumati na milane kii vajah se ames main bhrashtachar ke maamalon kii jaanch rukii hua he
 So the question is arising whether the motive behind the attempt to save Vineet Chaudhary is to cover up all the cases of corruption in AIIMS
 ames ne apni press release main vineet choudhary ke paksh main daleel di he ki unhen ab tak chargeshit thamai nahin gai, isliye isamen lage aaropon par punarvichaar kiya ja rahaa he lekin sawaal yah bhi he ki pichley ek saal se is chargeshit ko thande baste main kyon rakhaa gaya
 The comments hairaan karne vaali baat yah he ki vineet choudhary kii chargeshit par punarvichaar ke liye november 2013 main bhi swasthya mantralay ne ames ke nideshak se kaha or tab bhi vartmaan nideshak em si mishra ne choudhary ke khilaaf aaropon ko sahi bataate hue chargeshit daayar karne kii anumati di
 Only after that the central Harshavardhan cleared the charge sheet against this officer
 ab sawaal ye he ki maujuuda swasthya mantri jepi nadda choudhary ke khilaaf karrwai ko kyon roke hue hai? It is clear that this case is not only about the corruption of the cases of corruption within AIIMS, but also of the dignity of the judiciary, because the cabinet minister of Modi government is trying to save the officer who is surrounded by all the allegations and The minister himself has been given notice in this regard from the court

 sibiai kii aapasi ladaai main uski vishwasaneeyata par hi sawaal khadey ho rahe hai
 About this, Union Minister RK Singh put the government's side in front of the media
 isamen unhone sawaalon kaa jawaab dete hue spasht kiya ki maamle kii gambhirtha ko dekhte hue sarkaar ne jo kadam uthaae, ve bilkul thik the
 On the ruckus created by the number one and number two battle in the CBI, Union Minister RK Singh says, "there is no point in what the opposition is talking about
" jaanboojhkar aisi baaten kii ja rahi he
 The truth is that whatever cbi's work is in corruption cases, its supervision is with the CVC
 sibiai diarector kii bhi jo niyukti hoti he vah bhi sivisi kii adhyakshata main gathit cameti karti he
 Whatever selection is done in CBI is done by CVC
 yahaan tak kii sibiai diarector kii niyukti bhi sivisi karti he or uskaa naam pradhanmantri ke paas bhejti he
 In the cases of corruption, whatever action is to be taken in all the ministries is on the advice of the CVC
 sivisi kaagaj jabt bhi kar saktaa haiyahaa par kya tathy hai? agast maheene main sibiai main number 2 special diarector ne aarope lagaate hue chitthee likhi ki ve ek bhrashtachari ko giraftaar karnaa chaahate the lekin sibiai diarector ne roak diya
 The director had taken bribe from him
 yah aarope number tu ne number van par agast main lagaaya
 The CVC then asked for papers on these allegations which he had the right to
 sivisi kaagaj jabt bhi kar saktaa he
 Wrote the letter three or four times but after that when the papers were not received, what was done in the meantime? But an FIR was lodged against the person who was charged
 nilambit karne kii sifarish kar sakati thisivisi ne acha kiya ki donon ko avkaash par bheja jaae taaki nishpaksh jaanch ho sake
 That's perfect
 sivisi kii anushansa par sarkaar kaam karti he
 The charge was to be investigated against the director
 unhone us ko baadhit kiya, doosraa unhone anushaasanheenata kii
 They did not give the papers they asked for
 isapar sivisi chaahati to unako nilambit karne kii sifarish kar sakati thi
 But this was not done and he was sent on leave
 turant karrwai na hoti to kaagaj lekar chale jatevipaksh ke aaropon par aarake singh kaa kahana he ki sarkaar ne jo kiya he ekadam sahi kiya he
 Legally, the option that CVC chose was a very mild option
 sivisi ke paas or bahut se opshan the ki in ko nilambit kiya jaae, lekin aisa nahin kiya gaya
 This has been done to save the institution
 number van kahata he ki number do ne ghoose lee he
 Number two is saying number one has already taken bribe
 aadhi raat ko karrwai karne par aarake singh kaa kahana he ki turant karrwai na hoti to kaagaj lekar chale jate
 No case of Rafael Deal
 On the charge of obstructing the investigation of Rafael Deal of Tharahul Gandhi, RK Singh says that there was no case of Rafael Deal, it is a lie
 rahul gandhi ko thodi si akl honi chahie
 If CVC gives clean chit to Alok Verma, he will come back and do the same investigation
 agar clinit nahin detii he or unako hataaya jaataa he to jo bhi nayaa diarector aayega vahi sivisi samiti kii adhyakshata main jaanch karegaa
 Union Minister Smriti Irani has shied away from the ongoing controversy over the release of Sanjay Leela Bhansali's film Padmavati
 smriti ne ahmedabad main press conference ke dauraan padmavati vivaad par kaha, 'mujhe is sandarbh main kuch bhi nahin bolnaa he
 i do not want to say anything about the story and the story about which i have not known, have not seen and have not read it
 ' bataa den ki kuch samay pehle smriti irani ne kaha tha ki padmavati kii relies ko lekar koi samasya nahin aegi
 The government will take care of law and order
 lekin ab gujarat chunaavon ko dekhte hue smriti irani ne film par you-turn le liya he
 The release of Padmavati in Chittorgarh has been opposed by Deepika's dance, fearing that the Election Commission has rejected the bjp's demand that the release of the film Padmavati be banned due to the assembly elections in Gujarat or It should be carried forward
 ye maang bhaajapa kii pradesh ikai ne chunaav ayog ko ek patr likhakar kii thi
 According to TV reports, the Election Commission has refused to ban Sanjay Leela Bhansali's film or pursue its release
 padmavati par roak lagane se chunaav ayog kaa inkaar, BJP ne kii thi maangagujrat ke pradesh bhaajapa upaadhyaksh aaike jadeja ne media ko bataaya tha ki gujarat ke 15-16 jilon ke rajput samaaj ne party se is film ko bain karaae jane kii maang kii thi
 His argument was that the film has tampered with historical facts, which has hurt the sentiments of the Rajput society
 isliye unhone film par bain kii maang kii
 The film is releasing on December 1
 arjuna kapur aae bhansaali ke saport menfilm or iske diarector sanjay lila bhansaali kaa jagah-jagah virodh ho rahaa he, lekin ab arjuna kapur, bhansaali ke saport main utar aae hai
 Actually, Mr
 Rajput Karani Sena felt that the film would feature a dream sequence between Alauddin Khilji (ranveer Singh) and Rani Padmavati (deepika Padukone)
 iske baad karani sena ne film ke cast or kru ko chaiyn kii saans nahin lene di
 When the political parties in Rajasthan protested the screening, Bhansali released the video and clarified that there are no romantic sequences between the two in the film

 vivek or divyanka ne 2016 main shaadi kii thi
 The wedding took place in Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh
 bataate chalem ki divyanka bhopal kii hi hai
 In 2017, 4 people died every hour, half the number of people who died from not wearing a helmet without a helmet
 Increased fines under the new Motor Vehicle Act brought by the government from 4 states are not appealing to many people
 ek taraf jahaan zyaadaatar rajyon ne jurmaane kii badi hui daron par ankush lagaaya he, vahiin, sadak, yatayaat or rajmarg mantri nitin gadakari ne jurmaane ke ijaphe ko sahi bataaya
 They believe that the increased rates can be used to rein in the deaths that are occurring due to non-compliance with the rules of the road
 india today kii data intelligence unit (DIU) ne bharat main 2017 main hue sadak haadason ke aankadon kaa akalan kiya or paaya ki sadak haadason main sabase zyada dupahiyaa chaalak hi maare jate hai
 According to the data available so far in 2017, around 48,746 two-wheelers in India lost their lives in road accidents
 aankadon ne yah bhi bataaya ki in main se 73
 8 percent of two-wheelers did not wear helmets
 iskaa matlab yah ki bharat main 2017 main har ghante 4 logon kii maut hui jo bina helmet ke sadak par dupahiyaa vaahan par savaar the
 Two-wheeler drivers come first in road accidents
 2017 main 48,746 dupahiyaa chaalkon kii sadak haadase main mrityu ho gayi thi jo sadak haadase main marane waalon kii sankhya kaa 33 pratishat he
 Two-wheeler drivers followed by car / jeep / taxi drivers where the death toll was 26,869
 uske baad aate hai trek / tempo / tractor vaale jahaan marane waalon kii sankhya 17,158 thi
 There were 9069 bus passengers in the list of people who died due to road accidents, while the number of people who died in auto rickshaws was 7167
 kul milakar 35,975 dupahiyaa chaalak jinaki sadak haadason main maut hui thi, ne helmet nahin pahana tha
 Of these, 58 percent were driving themselves and 42 percent were sitting behind
 aadhi mautein sirf chaar rajyon mempani padtaal main DIU ne yah bhi paaya ki helmet na pahanane se marane waalon kii aadhi sankhya to chaar rajyon se hi thi
 The highest number of deaths were reported in Tamil Nadu, where 6105 (17 per cent) two-wheelers did not wear helmets and were killed in the accident
 tamilnadu ke baad aate hai uttar pradesh jahaan helmet na pahanane vaale mritkon kii sankhya 4406 thi
 In this case, Maharashtra was at the third place where the number of dead people not wearing helmets was 4369
 chauthe sthaan par aata he madhya pradesh jahaan marane waalon kii sankhya 3183 thi
 Meghalaya and Mizoram were two states where there was no one to die from not wearing a helmet
 helmet na pahanane vaale mritkon kii sankhya sabase zyada tamilnadu main thi, lekin yah bhi jaan lenaa chahie ki sabase zyaada sadak durghatnaayen bhi isi rajya main hui thim
 This means that out of every four two-wheeler related road accidents in Tamil Nadu, only one person died
 yadi prati 100 dupahiyaa vaahan haadason main marane waalon kii dar nikaali jaae to jharkhand pehle sthaan par aata he
 In Jharkhand, 52 percent of two-wheeler-related deaths were reported - one death per 2 accidents
 jharkhand ke baad aate hai rajasthan (40
 84%), Punjab (40
 67%), uttar pradesh (38
 89%), Maharashtra (36
 81%) or pashchim bengal (36
 27%) where the rate of death of non-helmet was the highest in accidents
 arunachal pradesh (6
 45%), Nagaland (6
 25%), kerala (5
 55%), Delhi (5
 41%), tripura (4
 17%), Sikkim (4
 17%) or jammu kashmir (1
 01%) were states where this rate was less than 10 percent
 mizoram or meghalaya main aisa koi bhi vyakti nahin tha jo helmet na pahanane ke kaaran maaraa gaya
 -helmet wearers - 91 percent of the accidents are least hurt
 jahaan desh main helmet na pahanane vaale mritkon kii sankhya bahut zyaada he, chotil hone waalon kii sankhya usase bhi zyaada he
 DIU found in its investigation that 91 percent of the total two-wheeler accidents were where the ride was affected - meaning they either died, or suffered serious injuries or minor injuries
 tamilnadu main hue har 100 haadason main 126 dupahiyaa savaar logon ko kam se kam chot to pahunchi hi thi
 Tamil Nadu is followed by Maharashtra, Rajasthan, West Bengal, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand and Karnataka where one out of every 100 two-wheelers who did not wear helmets were affected
 apane duusare kaarykaal ke prarambh main hi kashmir mudde ko sulajhane ke liye katibaddh dikh rahe pradhanmantri modi(pm Modi) kaa yah kootnithik masterstroke mana ja rahaa he
 The news agency IANS asked him many questions about his decision on Article 370, which has been welcomed by many, and some opposed
 jab pradhanmantri se poocha gaya, is samay ek asahaj-si shanti dekhne ko mil rahi he, so, aapako kyon lagata he ki jammu evam kashmir ke log aapke saath khadey honge, to pradhanmantri ne apane andaaz main spashtataa ke saath jawaab diya, "kashmir par liye gaye nirnay kaa jin logon ne virodh kiya, unki jaraa suchi dekhie - asaamaanya nihit swaarthee samooh, raajnneetik parivaar, jo aatank se sahanubhuti rakhte hai or kuch vipaksh ke mitra - lekin bharat ke logon ne apni raajnneetik sambhddhataon se itar jammu evam kashmir or ladakh ke bare main uthaae gaye kadamon kaa samarthan kiya he
 
 
 It is about the nation, not about politics
 
 
 bharat ke log dekh rahe hai ki jo nirnay kathin, magar zaruri the, or pehle asambhav lagate the, ve aaj hakeekat ban rahe hai
 
 
 "prime Minister Narendra Modi has a clear idea that life in the valley will be normal
 unhone kaha ki is praavdhaan ne vastav main bharat kaa nuksaan kiya he, or isse mutthibhar pariwaron or kuch algaavvaadiyon ko laabh hua he
 The PM said, "now everyone is clearly aware of how Article 370 and 35A kept Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh completely isolated
 
 
 saat dashakon kii is sthiti se logon kii aakankshaayen puri nahin ho pain
 
 
 Citizens were kept away from development
 
 
 hamaara drushtikon alag he - garibi ke dushchakr se nikaalkar logon ko adhik aarthik avasaron se jodne kii aavashyaktaa he
 
 
 It did not happen for years
 
 
 ab ham vikaas ko ek mauka den
 
 
 "the Prime Minister made a fervent request to his Kashmiri brothers," My siblings from Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh always wanted a better opportunity, but Article 370 did not allow this to happen
 
 
 mahilaon or bacchon, SC or ST samudaayon ke saath anyaay hua
 
 
 The biggest thing is that the innovative ideas of the people of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh could not be used
 
 
 aaj BPO se lekar starop tak, khaadya prasanskaran se lekar paryaton tak, kai udyogon main nivesh aa saktaa he or sthaneey yuvaaon ke liye rojgaar paidaa ho saktaa he
 
 
 Education and skill development will also flourish
 
 
 "unhone kaha, "main jammu evam kashmir ke apane bahanon or bhaaiyon ko aashwast karnaa chahta hum ki ye kshetra sthaneey logon kii ichchhaaon, sapanom or mahatvakankshaon ke anuroop viksit kiye jaaenge
 
 
 Articles 370 and 35A were like chains in which people were fastened
 
 
 ye zanjiren ab tut gai hai
 
 
 "those who are opposing the decision taken on Jammu and Kashmir, the Prime Minister believes that they should simply answer a basic question," why do they want to maintain Articles 370 and 35A
 
 ? "he said," He has no answer to this question
 
 
 or ye vahi log hai, jo har us cheez kaa virodh karte hai, jo aam aadmi kii madad karne vaali hoti he
 
 
 When the railroad gets built, they will oppose it
 
 
 unka dil keval naksaliyon or aatankwaadiyon ke liye dhadkta he
 
 
 Today every Indian stands with the people of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh and i am confident that they will stand with us in promoting development and bringing peace
 
 
 "IANS ne loktantr ko lekar jataai ja rahi chintaaon ke bare main poocha, kya kashmir ke logon kii aawaaj suni jaaegi, to pradhanmantri narendra modi ne nishchaypurvak kaha, "kashmir ne kabhi bhi loktantr ke paksh main itani majboot patibaddhta nahin dekhi
 
 
 Recall the participation of the people during the panchayat elections
 
 
 logon ne badi sankhya main mat daale or dhamkaane ke aage jhuke nahin
 
 
 In november-december 2018, 35,000 sarpanches were elected and the panchayat elections recorded a record 74 per cent
 
 
 panchayat chunaav ke dauraan koi hinsa nahin hui
 
 
 Not a single drop of blood fell in the electoral violence
 
 
 yah tab hua, jab mukhyadhara ke dalon ne is puri prakriya ke prati udaseenta dikhaai thi
 
 
 It is very satisfying that now panchayats have come to the forefront for development and human empowerment
 
 
 kalpana kiijie, itane saalon tak satta main rahane waalon ne panchayaton ko majboot karne ko vivekpurna nahin paaya
 
 
 And also remember that he gives great sermons on democracy, but his words never change
 
 
 "yah saaf he ki pradhanmantri us gutthi ko sulajhane par adig the, jise duhsadhay mana ja rahaa tha, unhone is mudde kaa vishad adhyayan kiya
 He said, "it amazed and saddened me that the 73rd Amendment does not apply in Jammu and Kashmir
 
 
 aise anyaay ko kaise bardaasht kiya ja saktaa he
 
 
 The This has happened in the last few years, when the panchayats in Jammu and Kashmir got the powers to work towards progress
 
 
 73wein sanshodhan ke tahat panchayaton ko die gaye kai vishyon ko jammu evam kashmir kii panchayaton ko sthanantarit kiya gaya
 
 
 Now i have requested the Honorable Governor to work towards the block panchayat elections
 
 
 haal main jammu evam kashmir prashasan ne 'back tu village' kaarykram yojit kiya, jisamen logon ko nahin, balki samoochee sarkari mashinari ko logon tak pahunchnaa padaa
 
 
 They reached them only to alleviate the problems of the people
 
 
 aam nagarikon ne is kaarykram ko saraahaa
 
 
 The result of these efforts is in front of everyone
 
 
 svachh bharat, gramin vidyutikaran or aisi hi anya pahalen jamini str tak pahunch rahi hai
 
 
 This is the real democracy
 
 
 "jammu evam kashmir main galatiyon or asantulan ko sudhaarna pradhanmantri ke iraade kaa aadhaar he, jaisaa unhone kaha, "maine logon ko aashwast kiya he ki jammu, kashmir main chunaav jari rahenge or keval in kshetron ke log hai, jo vrihattar janasamudaay kaa pratinidhitiv karenge
 
 
 Yes, those who ruled Kashmir think it is their divine right, they will dislike democratization and make wrong things
 
 
 ve nahin chaahate ki apni mehnat se safal yuva netritv ubhare
 
 
 These are the same people whose conduct in the 1987 election was questionable
 
 
 anuchhed 370 ne paardarshita or javabdehi se pare jaakar sthaneey rajnatik varg ko laabh pahunchaaya
 
 
 Its removal will strengthen democracy

 Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath was sworn in on Sunday when Prime Minister Narendra Modi and SP General Secretary Mulayam Singh Yadav met
 to mulaayam singh ne unke kaan main kuch kaha tha, tabhi se yah charchaa kaa vishay ban gaya tha ki aakhir mulaayam singh ne piem modi ke kaan main kya kaha tha
 According to a report in the Telegraph, according to a BJP leader, Mulayam Singh Yadav had asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to take care of a little Akhilesh Yadav, and teach him too
 mulaayam ke ye kehane ke baad pradhanmantri narendra modi ne bhi akhilesh ke kandhe par haath rakhaa tha
 Significantly, many senior leaders attended the swearing-in ceremony of Yogi Adityanath

 Kejriwal started the campaign for the Lok Sabha elections at a rally in Rohtak, Haryana
 mukhyamantri bhupendra singh hooda ke bete dipendra hooda ke khilaaf aam aadmi party ne rohtak se sabase majboot sthaneey chehre naveen jaihind ko maidan main utaara he
 The competition from outside looks big and bumpy, but the inside thing is that AAP candidate Naveen Jaihind does not even have 6 thousand rupees to pay the rent of his one room house in Delhi
 isliye naveen jaihind ne apni patni ko dilli se rohtak bula liya he
 Not only this, the candidate who has been fielded to challenge him in Hooda's stronghold has no money to print leaflets and leave leaflets
 aisa nahin ki party ko is baat kii jaankaree nahin he
 Naveen Jaihind and other activists have pleaded with the party high command many times for financial help, but there is a clear instruction from the party that the money should be arranged from the Lok Sabha constituency itself
 party ke kaaryakarta is baat se pareshaan hai ki log chanda dene ko to taiyaar hai lekin jaise hi chanda dene waalon ke naam saarvajanik (website par jari karne) kii baat aati he log peeche hat jate hai kyonki mukhyamantri hooda kii naaraazgi bhala koun mol le
 No matter how much public support the Aam Aadmi Party gets in Rohtak, it will not be easy to contest elections against the Chief Minister's son without money

 Look at Vidarbha's 23-year-old Akshay Karanvar, who performs off-spin with the same ability with both hands, trying his best in batting in the middle order as well
 mumbai ke vankhede stadium main pehle baroda or duusare din kerala ke ballebaazon ke saamne unhone apane karishmai spel kaa muzahiraa kiya
 But before this Himachal captain Bipul Sharma was so shocked by Akshay's bowling that he asked the umpire, 'how can this happen? However, now this question is not surprising for Akshay
 enditivi se exclusive baatcheet main unhone bataaya, 'jab main 13 saal kaa tha, mere coach baaluu navghare sar ne mujhe daaen haath se gendbaazi or baayen haath se ballebaazi karte dekha or poocha ki kya main baayen haath se spin bhi kara saktaa hum

 He displayed his charismatic spell in front of the batsmen of Baroda on the first day and the second day at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai
 lekin isse pehle himachal ke captain bipul sharma to akshay kii gendbaazi se itane chaunk gayi ki unhone ampire se puch liya, 'ye kaise ho saktaa he? haalanki akshay ke liye ab ye sawaal achraj bharaa nahin he
 In an exclusive conversation with NDTV, he said, 'when i was 13 years old, my coach Baloo Navghare sir saw me bowling with right hand and batting with left hand and asked if i can spin with left hand also
 iske baad maine donon haathon se gendbaazi karnaa shuru kar diya
 Akshay, a resident of Pandharkavada village in Yavatmal district, has also been the highest wicket-taker in the Cooch Behar Trophy for Vidarbha
 tippaniyan Sulakshan Kulkarni, who has nurtured talents like Rohit Sharma, Ajinkya Rahane, Dhawal Kulkarni for India, further enhanced Akshay's talent

 Salma Ansari, wife of former Vice President Hamid Ansari, has set a great example of communal harmony
 unhone aligarh sthit chachaa nehru madrasa main mandir-masjid kaa nirmaan karaane kaa elaan kiya he
 Salma Ansari said today (saturday) that this will be the first such madrasa in the country, where there will be both a temple and a mosque in the same courtyard
 bataa den ki salama ansaari aligarh main 19 saal se yah madrasa chalaa rahi hai, jisamen chah bade daandaata hindu hai
 Salma Ansari said that four thousand Muslims and more than one thousand Hindu children are studying in the madrasa
 madrase main mandir ke nirmaan ko lekar kattarpathiyon kii aapatti ke sawaal par unhone kaha ki mujhe fark nahin padataa ki koi kya kah rahaa he
 According to Salma Ansari, she is building this temple for the protection of Hindu children studying in the hostels here
 unhone kaha ki do maheene main madrasa main mandir or masjid banakar taiyaar ho jaaenge
 Salma Ansari said that today's environment is not good in the country and the state
 hostel se baahar mandir darshan ke liye jate vakt kisi bachche ke saath kuch ho gaya to is maamle main jawaab dete nahin banegaa
 Now the temple will be built in the madrasa itself
 is mandir main shivaji or hanumanji kii murtiyon hongi
 At the same time recently, on getting a weapon in a madrasa in Bijnor of UP, he said, it is a very shameful incident
 salama ansaari ne kaha ki kisi bhi madasare kii suraksha karnaa madrasa sanchaalkon kii hi jimmedaari he
 The Aam Aadmi Party has announced its second list of candidates for the Lok Sabha elections, which includes 30 names
 is suchi main dilli se ek, gujarat se ek, haryana se paanch, jammu-kashmir se ek, maharashtra se 10, madhya pradesh se chah or punjab se ek ummidavaar ke naam shaamil hai
 Mahatma Gandhi's grandson Rajmohan Gandhi is the party's candidate from East Delhi, where he will directly face former Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dixit's son and Congress MP Sandeep Dixit
 bijepi ke purv netaa ranjan sushant himachal pradesh ke kangra jile se 'aap' ke ummidavaar ke rup main chunaav ladenge

 Something similar has happened with Ashish Kaul's book 'didda - The Warrior Queen of Kashmir' which has come to the readers in the past
 ashish corporate jagat main safal pari khilne ke baad indinon lekhan jagat main bhi dhooma machaa rahe hai
 He discussed a lot with the book 'refugee Camp', highlighting the root cause of terrorism and its conditions in Kashmir
 yah kitaab kashmir par hindi main likhi sarvaadhik charchit kitabon main se ek he or bharat se lekar pakistan tak ek bade pathakvarg dwaara saraahi gai
 'didda-the Warrior Queen of Kashmir' is a book written on his historical subject, and apart from 'refugee Camp' it was first printed in English
 is kitaab ke madhyam se unhone rani lakshmi bai samet ungliyon par gini ja sakane vaali mahila role modells kii sankhya se santusht bhartiya samaaj ko kashmir kii rani didda ke rup main wo mahanayika di he, jisane apni sharton par apane banaaye niyamon ke anuroop apane yug main purushvaadi pitrusattatmak samaaj ko na sirf chunauti di balki maukey dar maukey use thenga bhi dikhaaya
 This book exposes many aspects of Didda's life in such a way that the reader seems to ask himself that if such a charismatic woman had the reins of governance, why was her reference so blurred that no one could show it? Certainly, this patriarchal society, in exchange for the on-going defeat from that heroine, lost her heroic saga from history so much that she became a witch queen and disappeared somewhere
 lohaar rajvansh (aaj kaa haryana, punjab, poonch rajori jiskaa bhaag tha) main janmi ek khubasurat nanheen bacchee ko uske maan baap sirf isliye tyaag dete hai ki wo aapng paidaa hui
 She grew up by drinking the maid's milk, the girl did not consider her handicap as a hindrance and became proficient in the art of warfare and gained skill in various sports
 ek din akhet ke dauraan kashmir ke raja kshemgupta ne jab us khubasurat rajkumaari didda ko dekha to pehali hi nazar main dil de baitha
 King Kshemgupta was a good king
 yah jaan lene ke baad bhi ki didda langadi he usne usase byaah rachaaya or didda kii kismat ek tarah se palati kha gayi
 Not only did she get her husband's love, respect, and son Ratna, but she also started participating in the reign of Kshemgupta
 is bhagidaari ke sammaan main apni patni ke naam par sikaa jari kiya
 He became the first king to be known as his wife
 'didda -da variyar queen of kashmir' main ullikhit varnan ke anusaar jab sabakuch thikthak chal rahaa tha tabhi ek din akhet ke dauraan kshemgupta kii mrityu ho gai, bas phir kya tha didda kii zindagi ek dauraahey par khadi ho gai
 In this crossroads, where on the one hand there was a tradition of grief and sati of the death of the husband, on the other hand, the responsibility of the mother who was responsible for the upbringing and education of a little prince until he was able to handle the regalia
 isi dwandv ke dauraan marate hue raja ko rajya ke surakshit haathon main dene kaa pran use yakaayak wo shakti de jaataa he, jiske chalate wo sati hone se manaa kar detii he
 In 'didda - The Warrior Queen of Kashmir' it is interesting to read how from time to time Didda broke the rules made by the male ruling society and made his own rules
 iskaa nateeja yah niklaa ki mardwaadi maansikta ne didda ko dian tak qaraar diya
 It was difficult for the male society to understand how a girl with disabilities without elusive powers could rule the entire Kashmir and a large part of the earth for more than four decades? Didda's story is the story of such a heroine's life journey Who started guerrilla techniques to start a kingdom, become the wife of the king of Kashmir and then widow, taking up many wars and winning wars
 Passing through the passage to the that goes from interesting twist, where possibly described developments to become the world's first commando force, unilateral military
 yah kahani saahas, sanyam, kartavya or rashtrabhakti kii gaatha to kahati hi he, maanav man ke vikaar or dwesh kii gaatha bhi sunaati he
 It is not only that Didda was expelled from her palace by the son she lived for
 iske baavjood usne janata se judaav jari rakhaa, mandiron kaa nirmaan karaayaa, saare asia ke saath vyapaar or iran tak faile akhand bharat kii simaaon kii raksha ke liye ranneeti nirmaan karaayaa
 All the references of this book take you to that period of history, which is not talked about very often
 in sabake bich us khoonkhaar mahmud gazani kaa bhi zikr aata he, jiske hindustan main pravesh karne ke baad jo vidhwans hua, us itihaas ko samoochaa desh jaanata he, par yah kitaab mahmud gazani kaa zikr karte hue ek aise prasang kii baat karti he jis se adhikansh log anbhigya hai
 One of the most feared invaders to attack India, Ghazni, who looted the Somnath temple and destroyed many cities, was prevented from entering India twice by his tactics and defeated in battle, Later he changed the way and entered India through Gujarat
 ek ke baad ek kai yuddh prasangon ke baad dilachasp he didda kaa apane vaaris ko chunane kaa tarika
 Didda also had his own way to ensure that a strong state would go into the hands of a capable ruler
 apane bhaanjon ke bich usne ek anuthi pratiyogita rakhi ki jo sabase zyaada seb ek baar main apane haathon main sametakar le aayega wo use hi satta kii bagdor saunp degi
 It is clear that this was Didda's own way of assessing the right balance of might and wisdom of the future king of the kingdom
 rani didda kii yah vir gaatha yon to kaalpanik lagati he, par kathakaar ke rup main ashish kaul ise asli nayak kii virgatha bataate hai
 The saga that he heard in childhood, and which he wrote after about six years of Ratajago
 unke mutabik yon to raja vikramaditya ke baad zamin or shaskaon ko jodakar ek akhand samrajya par rajya karne vaali us abhootpurv rani kii puri kahani jaanane kaa daawa koi nahin kar saktaa, par is kitaab ke bare main vah sirf ek hi vaakya kahana chaahate hai, 'ye didda ke jariye har jujharu mahila kii kahani he, vishwa bhar kii mahilaon ke liye didda prerana he
 While reading "didda-the Warrior Queen of Kashmir", it seems that the writer has made an effort to bring the story of Shaurya Bahadur Veerangana Rani Didda to the public by adding the pieces of information available
 sach puuchhie to rani didda kii kahani aaj ke jamaane main tab or bhi samasamyik ho jaati he, jab bahut-si mahilaayein apni sangharsh bhari yatra ke baad satta va shoharat ke bich safalataa paakar oonche padon par na sirf baith rahi hai, balki apni kabaliyat se duniya bhar ko chaunkaa rahi hai
 This is exactly what Rani Didda did 1200 years ago
 is kitaab kaa forward ek or asaadhaaran mahila para olympics champion or padmashri deepa maalik ne likhaa he
 Deepa says that 'this is the story of a unique touching Indian woman forgotten by Indian history, which the author has beautifully crafted into words and garlands of the story to convey it to the people
 ye kahani sirf kahani na hokar mahilaon se judi kai vaishvik manyataon ko todatii he or vishwa ko mahilaon kii kabaliyat kii na sirf izzat karnaa sikhaati he
 Rather, it also increases their acceptability
 
 'didda-the Warrior Queen of Kashmir' has not been much time in the market, but this book is getting a lot of love from the readers, and in the first week, it reached a new record by reaching tenth number in Amazon's bestseller rankings

 unhone iske vinievesh kii sambhaavnaaon se bhi inkaar kiya
 It is worth mentioning that Air India has a debt burden of about 50 thousand crores
 iske saath hi unhone yah bhi joda ki karadaataaon ke dhan ko is tarah hameshaa ke liye is par nahin kharch kiya ja saktaa
 In fact, Air India is also struggling with the current adverse business conditions despite being burdened with heavy debt
 2007 main air india or indian airlines ke aapasi vilay ke baad se bane air india kii haalat ko durust karne ke liye upie sarkaar ne 30 hajaar karod kaa belout package diya tha
 Raju, however, also said that like others he does not want to curse it but Air India will have to work unitedly to achieve its goals
 unhone kaha, " yah behad shandaar airline he
 i like Air India but i cannot assure that taxpayers' money is spent on it forever
 " However, its financial situation has improved a bit compared to the past and Air India plans to buy 100 aircraft in the next four years, moving towards expansion amidst the growing prospects of the domestic aviation market
 is masale par raju kaa kahana he, ' main mahasoos karata hum ki air india team main ekajutata kii darkaar he
 Where they work as a team, they have performed well and where they do not work as a team, they look isolated in different directions
 lekin koi bhi ghadi kii suyiyon ko peeche nahin ghuma saktaa

 He said, "this is a great airline

 Not only this, Nawazuddin, who has made his mark in different types of cinema, does not have much desire for Hollywood films because he sees so much potential in Indian films that he can make his mark on the film canvas of the world
 mumbai main stregl ke dinon main phake ke din dekhne vaale nawaz apni safalataa se khush hai or unka silvaya ek hi kaala suut wo har red carpet par pahante hai
 After the fake IAS, IPS officer, now the fake case has come to light
 pichley maheene, ek aadmi ne jila court eta main sarender kiya
 He claimed that he was a wanted criminal
 use police ne giraftaar kargelmen bhar diya
 The secret of this prisoner soon opened and everyone was shocked when the story came out
 darasal, ye aadmi wanted apradhi he hi nahin
 But he is a laborer
 iskaa naam miajan he, jo asal apradhi ke badale jail main band tha or use iske liye har din 300 rupee milte the
 This amount was double what he earned every day
 maamla tab khulaa, jab miajan kii patni usase milane ai
 That day he was being taken to the court for a bail application hearing
 usne tab adhikariyon ko bataaya ki vah apradhi nahin he, balki uske pati or ehsaan kii deal hui, jiske chalate wo jail main band he
 The case of animal smuggling is going on in favor and he is in this case since last November
 jab court ne use saman bheja, to usne apni jagah kisi or ko bhejne kaa sochaa
 SK Verma, SSP, Etah, said, "ehsan played a trick
 usne apni jagah miajan ko farji pahchaan patr ke saath court bheja, jisase wo uski jagah jail main band ho
 Not only this, he also took Miyazan into confidence and assured him that he would get bail soon, but Miyazan's wife spoiled the whole plan
 'is dauraan, farji kaidi ko police ne ek apradhi kii madad karne ke liye jail main band kar diya he
 The police is looking for the real culprit
 agar aap ek varking vuman hai to aapako bahut achche se pataa hoga ki periods ke dinon main kaam karnaa kaisaa hota he
 Life is a little disturbed during periods
 khaastaur par un auraton ke liye jinhen dard zyada hota he
 Now just think that on the one hand your mood is not good on its own, from that you will know how your partner will feel if you add and subtract from your period date
 
 
 ye baat aapako ajeeb jarur lag sakati he lekin aisa hua he
 The case is from Australia, where a woman finds out that her male colleagues who work with her track her period cycle
 taaki wo un dinon main usase duuri bana saken
 According to this story published in The Herald Sun, the woman was discussing a relationship with men who worked with her on her lunch break
 tabhi ek aadmi ne usase kaha ki wo peeth peeche baaten karti he, isiilie abhi tak single he
 After listening to the man's words, this woman started crying
 haalanki us aadmi ne maafee maangi lekin saath hi ye bhi kah diya ki uskeperiods chal rahe hai na
 
 
 When this woman heard this, she immediately asked the man how he knew that his periods were going on
 is par usne bataaya ki wo calendar par uske period cycle ko trek karte hai
 Giving reasons for doing so, the man said that during the period of the day, he becomes very moody and they want to stay away from him
 isi vajah se aisa karte hai
 The man said that he had made a calendar of period cycle and later sent it to everyone
 aapako bataa den ki aise bahut se ap hai jinaki madad se auraten apane period days count karti he
 But this case is really surprising

 Bill Gates, one of the world's billionaires, has told three major skills for future jobs
 bill gates ke mutabik aage badhane ke liesince, ejineering or iconomixki kam se kam basic jaankaree hona bahut jaruri he
 That is, these are the three things that can make you a billionaire in the future

 'jaruri nahin he ki aap tech profenles kii tarah baithkar koding karen lekin ye zarur jaane ki ek ejeeniyar kya karata he or kya nahin karata he

 It is said that Bill Gates has so much money that he is struggling to overcome it

 Since Bill Gates himself has given so much to the world and he is also a billionaire, we should take his point seriously
 cash kii killat ko lekar centre sarkaar or bhartiya rigerv bank lagaataar kah rahaa he ki desh main cash kii koi kami nahin he
 Technical reasons are being blamed for the disappearance of cash from atms, but the research report of SBI gives the reality of these claims
 report ke mutabik desh main jitani cash kii aavak honi chahie thi, utani nahin hui he
 There is still a shortfall of Rs 70 thousand crore
 esbiai ne kaha he ki cashles lenden ghatane kii vajah se yah sthiti paidaa hui he
 This figure of SBI report is quite different from the government figures
 centre sarkaar ne cash kii killat kii vajahon ko ginate hue kaha tha ki iconomi main sirf 25 hajaar karod rupee kii nagdi kii kami he
 SBI has said in its report that an average of 2 every month in atms across the country
 10 lakh karod rupee nikaale jate hai
 The report states that cash shortages depend on many things
 ise tay karne ke liye yah bhi dekha jaataa he ki desh kanominal iconomic growthkya he
 Along with this, it is also seen how much cash people have and how much digital transaction has increased in the country
 esbiai kii report ne kaha he ki desh main digital tranjaction gata he
 1 in the country
 2 kharab digital lenden hue
 Explain that cashless transactions have decreased since the second month of demonetisation
 report main kaha gaya he ki is tarah iconomi main cash kii kami 70 hajaar karod yaa usase kam ho sakati he
 It has been reported in the report that in the second half of FY 2018, an estimated Rs 15,291,00 crore will be withdrawn from atms through debit cards
 yah pichley chah maheenon ke mukaable 12
 2 percent more
 report main kaha gaya he ki agar nominal jidipi growth 9
 The presence of currency till March 2018 in Tosirculation has been up to 8 per cent
 4 kharab honi chahie thi
 Although actually this 17
 5 kharab rupee thi
 However SBI has simultaneously stated that 1
 9 kharab rupee kii kami ko kami nahin kaha ja saktaa he
 SBI has said that the cash shortage is currently happening
 uske liye 200 rupee ke noton kii chapai main teji laana jimmedaar ho sakati he
 Because of this, there would have been a change in the demand for small notes and their use would have increased to meet the need of big notes
 iske alaava report main kaha gaya he ki atm ko samay-samay parriffil karnahota he
 Due to this also, the problem of cash shortage is expected to increase slightly

 ' The elevated position is found not by looking at the age but by the experience
 agar offis main bos umr main aapse chota he or aae din unke saath bahes hoti rahati he to aaj hi roak len
 Because doing so can directly affect your work and professional life

 agar vah aapako profeshanali koi kaam karne kaa order den to ye katai naa sochen kii vah umr main chota he to aap par order kaise chalaa saktaa he
 Do not forget that their experience is more than you
 jab team de acchhee parfomens, to aise badhayen team kaa hausala
 
 
 Do not speak bitterly at heart, but even if you are small in your age, if they tell you about any work in the office, then do not take their said words to heart

 umr zyada he, to kaam kii raftaar kam hogi, umr kam he, to smartphone se chipka rahata hoga, ye sabhi galat dharanaen hai jo ham aamtaur par ham sab soch lete hai
 Avoid all these things

 Even though there may be differences due to age gap, but do not forget to respect the boss

 Become active: Low-age bosses are more active about work
 unhen kaam jaldi chahie hota he
 So get used to working fast
 iskaa phayda aapako bhi milegaa
 Also, the younger boss usually prefers to talk more by phone, mail instead of talking
 isliye unhen impress karnaa ho to vaise hi dhal jaaen jaise vah chaahate hai

 According to the World Health Organization, 1 billion people smoke and consume tobacco, half of which increases their chances of dying before normal age

 This number of India is about 1 million per year
 is baar valrd no tambaakoo diwas kii theme 'tambaakoo or hriday rog' rakhi gai he
 This means that people should be made aware of the heart and other serious problems caused by tobacco at the world level

 He said that as fast as tobacco is being consumed in India, it can be estimated how many lives are in danger due to tobacco consumption every year
 tambaakoo pine kaa jitna nuksaan he, usase kahin zyada nuksaan ise chabane se hota he
 Poisonous substances such as carbon monoxide and tar are found in tobacco and all these substances are fatal for health
 dhumrapaan or dhuen rahit (tambaakoo chabana) donon hi samaan rup se jaanaleva hai
 People start smoking either for style or status, but tobacco attacks your lungs and hinders the movement of oxygen to the heart and blood arteries

 According to him, in the areas where the Naxalites are setting fire to the old trains of the contractors, new vehicles of the contractors are safe at a few steps away
 isse saaf he ki soch-samaj kar naksali gadiyon main aag laga rahe hai
 He said that there were many cases in which new machines and vehicles engaged in construction work were completely safe, while the old vehicles parked near them were burnt so badly that all its parts were turned to ashes

 On the sidelines of a program, Shukla told reporters that the tension between the two ministers of the UPA government in the 2G spectrum case is only the media's yield and exploitation
 yadi pradhanmantri or vittamantri ke bich mulaakaat ho jaati he to bhi media usamen khabar nikaalane lagata he, jabaki aisi mulaakaaten swabhaavik he
 The point of difference between the two Union Ministers coming in the media is completely baseless

 In the matters of public importance of information and knowledge, Hindi states are cursed
 media ke zarie is pradesh ko a-suchit rakhaa jaataa he
 You can analyze the content of Hindi channels and newspapers
 balki khud hi check kiijie to acha rahegaa
 Such a big incident happened in Kashmir but the mainstream of Hindi media did not put it in front of the readers with plurality and diversity
 kisi ko kashmir par kuch pataa nahin he lekin sabake paas haa yaa naa main raay he
 Same situation with Assam
 hindi media main assam ko lekar kitni reporting he? aap jin akhbaaron ko rose subah uth kar padhate hai kya unka samvaadadaata maheene bhar se yaa saal bhar se naagarikta ke masale ko cover kar rahaa he? zaahir he hindi pradesh ke pathakon kaa raajnneetik str bheed or hangaamaa se hi upar uthta or girtaa rahata he
 i do not know the rest of the states
 ho saktaa he vahaan bhi yahi haal ho
 a state like Assam is going through such a huge human tragedy but there is no reporting with any seriousness and continuity
 ek factory main bani hui raay sabake bich baant di gai he
 The sense of stupidity is that Manoj Tiwari makes a statement in Delhi that the National Register should be counted here too
 wo us raajnneeti kaa beej bo rahe hai jo assam main boyaa gaya
 Due to which there is an outcry in both the Hindu and Muslim
 donon bangladeshi or bahari kii banaai gai raajnneetik chhavi se nikalnaa chaahate hai
 As a result, everyone got in line outside the National Register Center and climbed on the conveyor belt of the tragedy which the BJP leaders are saying is useless
 yah sari raajnneeti hindi pradeshon kii agyanta kii takat par ho rahi he
 Why is there silence in UP and Bihar? Because there is no information
 jaankaree main vividhta nahin he
 The youth here were given poor schools and colleges in the name of reading
 padhai ke naam par system ne dhokhaa diya or naujavaanon ne khud ke saath dhokhaa kiya
 In the name of jobs, the plastic thrown in the coaching centers looks like a bag of polythene bags
 kitaab ke naam par guide book he
 They are deceived by governments in the name of jobs
 nateeja wo guide book or apane hindi akhbaaron or channelon se jo kuch bhi jaanate hai wo sirf raajnneeti kaa diya hua haa yaa naa jaanate hai
 The decline of intellectualism based on daily information of Hindi states is causing loss to these states as well as to the country
 kyonki satta ke liye vot yaheen par he
 The intellectuals of the youth here are being insulted daily by the news channels
 aaj na kal in naujavaanon ko hindi media ke failaae andhkaar se baahar aane ke liye andolan karnaa hi hoga
 When the country is going through a severe recession, the anchor of the news channel is giving advice like avoiding the nuclear attack and reading the book
 samasya se lagaataar shift karne kii yah raajnneeti hindi pradeshon ke yuva nahin samajhenge to kisi laayak nahin rahenge
 They will be left only to the crowd
