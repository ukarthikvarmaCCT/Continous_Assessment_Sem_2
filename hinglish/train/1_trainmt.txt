 Shiv Sena President Uddhav Thackeray has taken a U-turn on the protest against increasing rail fares
 uddhav ne rail kiraaya badhaane ke faisle kaa ab khul kar samarthan karte hue kaha he ki railway safed hathi ho chukaa he or ise sanbhaalanaa aasaan nahin he
 Uddhav also said that Narendra Modi does not have any magic wand that will make everything right in a moment
 unhone kaha ki achche din aaenge, lekin thodaa vakt lagegaa
 Significantly, earlier Thackeray had said that he would meet Modi and demand the withdrawal of the increase in rail fares
 thakare ne party ke mukhpatr 'saamana' ke sampadakeey main rail kiraaye main badhotaree ke modi sarkaar ke faisle ko jaij qaraar diya he
 Thackeray has said that the public has high hopes from the Modi government
 aise main yah apeksha kii jaati he ki yah kiraaya vruddhi aakhri ho
 It is written in 'saamana', 'the condition of the railway is poor
 ye ek aisa safed hathi ban chukaa he jise sanbhaalanaa mushkil hota ja rahaa he
 And Modi has no such magic wand that in 2 or 5 days he will fix everything
 pichley 10 saalon main yatri kiraaya nahin badhaayaa gaya he or yatri kiraaye main di janevaali sabsidi ke chalate mantralay ko 28 hajaar karod rupee kaa nuksaan jhelana pad rahaa he
 In such a situation, if passengers have to provide security, provide facilities and provide a suitable environment, then the burden of increased fares will have to be borne
 'uddhav ne yah bhi kaha he ki mumbai kii badi aabaadi, trainon main badhati bheed, fail hote signal or rail system kii halaat sudhaarney ke liye ye kiraaya badhanaa kaaphi jaruri tha
 Not only this, it was necessary to increase the fare to increase the level of Indian Railways, which was included in the world's worst rail service
 congress par nishanasampadakeey main congress dwaara rail kiraaye main badhotaree ke khilaaf kiye ja rahe virodh par bhi nishaanaa saadhaa gaya he
 It has been said that everyone has seen what happened during upa's tenure and there is no need to tell it
 sampadakeey main likhaa gaya he, 'bihar ke ek mantri mahoday ne rail mantralay sambhala to use araajaktaa kaa swarup diya, vahiin pawan bansal ne rail mantralay sambhala to sidhe unke rishtedaar ne rail adhikariyon ke pramotion main paise kamaane kaa rasta apana liya
 The situation was that today, during the tenure of the people sitting in opposition, only the loot was done in the railway
 'modi kii tarif'saamana' main modi kii tarif karte hue kaha gaya he, 'modi ke raaj main achche din aanevaale hai
 And they will come but it will take some time
 aise main bharosa rakhen
 Also, this fare increase should be the last, that is what the people expect from the Modi government
 'gauratlab he ki beete shuukravaar ko modi sarkaar ne rail yatri kiraaye main 14
 2 per cent and 6 in freight
 5 fisadi vruddhi karne kaa elaan kiya
 This increase will be effective from June 25

 On September 3, President Xi Jinping will present the largest military parade in Chinese history
 parade ke din rashtriya chuttee kaa elaan kar diya gaya he
 Beijing has shut down factories for its preparations and removed half the cars from the roads to keep the sky blue
 magar aaj yah sari dhoomdhaam thodi betuki dikhaai de rahi he, kyonki log share bazaar ke dhwast hone or ummid se pehle hi arthvyavastha ke sust padane ke dohare sankat se jujh rahe hai
 a Beijing businessman, who has been suffering heavy losses since the market fell in July, says, "now which victory day to celebrate?" The same question is on every tongue in Beijing, Shanghai and many other Chinese cities and industrial centers today
 do dashak pehle 1990 ke dashak ke shuruaati saal main jab china ne apni arthvyavastha ko “kholane” kii shuruyaat kii thi, tabhi se uske netaaon kii khule dil se tarif kii jaati rahi he ki unhone apni kushal aguai main china ko duniya kii duusare number kii sabase badi arthvyavastha bana diya
 Asia's financial crisis came and went in 1997, similarly the 2008 global recession also passed
 lekin china kaa kaaravaan ek ke baad ek kirtiman kaayam karte hue berokatoke aage badhata gaya
 In 2009 China became the second largest economy in the world, surpassing Germany
 ek saal baad germany kaa ek or record todakar china duniya kaa sabase bada niryaatak desh ban gaya
 This was a great success for the country, which until two decades ago there was not much in the name of manufacturing industry
 pichley saal china kray-shakti ke paimaane par america ko peeche chhodkar duniya kii sabase badi arthvyavastha ban gaya
 Even on actual scales, his distance with America is steadily decreasing with each passing year
 lekin aaj, vaishvik aarthik urja centre ke taur par china ke belgaum ubhaar ke do dashakon main pehali baar, uske netaa asaamaanya rup se ghabaraae dikhaai dete hai or log dare hue hai
 On August 24, Shanghai stock market surprisingly 8
 5 fisadi gir gaya
 This was the biggest single day drop since 2007
 bazaar kii is badi tut se pehle ke kuch maheene china kii arthvyavastha ke liye baari gujarey the
 The economic data came one after another during the last few weeks, which exposed the crisis in China
 ye sankat july main duniya kii najar main aae, jab shanghai share bazaar ek saal tak record bulandi ke baad achaanak girane laga
 In just three weeks, investors lost nearly 4 trillion yuan (about $ 645 billion) in total capital
 mushkilen kisi bhi tarah mahaj share bazaar tak simit nahin hai
 China's manufacturing sector also seems to be breathless
 ispaat udyog maang se zyada ispaat banane kii kshamta ke sankat se jujh rahaa he, vahiin china ke bandargahon par dhaatu ayskon kaa dher lag gaya he
 According to a survey by China's financial magazine Kaishin, China's manufacturing sector growth slumped to an all-time low of 77 months in August and the Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) of 47
 1 par aa gaya
 This was a sign of the biggest decline since 2008
 kaishin insite group ke mukhya arthshaastri he fain kehete hai, “arthvyavastha apane sabase nichle staron par pahunchane kii prakriya main he
 "this year, the government reduced its GDP growth target to 7 percent
 yah 1990 ke baad se ab tak kaa sabase nichalaa str tha or do ankon kii vruddhi ke pichley puure dashak ke dauraan aisa sochaa bhi nahin ja saktaa tha
 Even this goal seems difficult to achieve
 pehali do timahiyon main china ne 7 fisadi kii vruddhi darj kii he, magar zyaadaatar antarrashtriya arthshaastri ek raay hai ki vaastavik vruddhi do se teen fisadi neeche rahi he
 In the wake of panic, these figures were taken as alarm bells and Beijing's economic planners began to take quick steps to interfere in the market
 jaankaron ke mutabik, isse unke asaamaanya rup se dahshatjada hone kaa pataa chalaa
 First of all, Beijing took a series of quick measures in an attempt to contain the stock market crash
 inamen usne kisi bhi company ke 5 fisadi se zyada share rakhane waalon ke liye unhen bechney par roak laga di, phir sarkari companiyon ko kai arab dollar mulya ke share kharidne kaa hukum suna diya or yahaan tak ki short-sailing karne waalon par jaanch bitha di tathaa unamem se kuch kaarobaariyon ko jail main daal diya
 The China Securities Regulatory Commission says it is investigating 52 cases of "illegal reductions in share capital"
 sarkaar ne communist party ke mukhpatr ke jariye baajaabta prachaar abhiyaan ched diya, chini nagarikon se “deshbhakt hone”, share kharidne or arthvyavastha ko sahaara dene ke liye kaha gaya
 But the party's requests will not make lice on people's ears
 kaarobaari lagaataar saste daamon par apane share bechate rahe, jiskaa nateeja 24 agast ke “kaale somvaar” ke rup main saamne aayaa
 Li Wei, an economics professor at Beijing's Cheung Kang Graduate School of Business, says, "the collapse of the Chinese stock market has been too costly for the Chinese government's credibility
" pichley saal ke aakhri maheenon se share bazaar ke bare main badi-badi baaten karnaa or use oochaal lene ke liye khub shah dena chini sarkaar kaa kharaab kadam tha, suchakank main oochaal par jashn manaanaa to or bhi bura tha
 The Chinese economy has to pay a heavy price for wrong policy-related steps
 ”sadakon par gussabazar main dakhsandaji ke liye beijing ko chaahe jitna doshi tehraaya jaataa ho, lekin lakhon niveshkon ko dekhte hue uski karrwai samaj main bhi aati he
 China's stock market is unique in the sense that while the institutional investors dominate the markets of developed countries, their number in Shanghai is very less
 shanghai ke 85 fisadi niveshkon ke khaaton main 1,00,000 aarambi (kareeb 10 lakh rupye) se kam bakaayaa he or maujuud aankadon ke mutabik unamem se 94 fisadi ke paas college kii degree bhi nahin he
 That is why the push for Shanghai's steep decline has been the biggest private Chinese investor
 masalan, lee lingamin sareekhe pehali baar nivesh karne waalon ko len
 Lee recently graduated from Beijing Normal University and bought his first shares in March, when the market boom was being pushed up on the front pages of government newspapers like People's Daily and in the evening news broadcasts
 
 alabatta 25 agast ko bazaar ke dhwast hone kaa piples daily main koi zikr nahin tha, jiskaa soshal media par chiniyon ne jamkar majaak bhi udaaya
 It was sensible for Li and millions of other Chinese to invest in the stock market
 real estate main susti chal rahi he or rajya-niyantrit byaaj daren itani lubhaavni nahin hai ki unke saamne zyada vikalp bachate
 When the party mouthpieces stamped their trust on the market, it was widely agreed by an opinion that betting on it would certainly be safe
 sarkaar logon ke nivesh ko khatre main nahin padane degi
 "the news said that there would be a 200 per cent increase," says Lee
 niveshkon ko bazaar ke jokhim ke bare main mushkil se hi kabhi aagaah kiya gaya
 "tens of thousands of people started running to buy shares, the market's fasting on the support of the government reached the point of satisfaction
 shanghai share bazaar disambar ke 3,000 ankon se chadhakar 12 june ko 5,166 ankon kii oonchai par pahunch gaya
 But after the explosion, the market has returned to where it was before the boom started
 lee kahati hai, “bazaar kuch is tarah pagalaa gaya ki arthshaastra se use samajhaayaa nahin ja saktaa
 He gave the Common Sense a cry
 kisi bhi cheez kii salanaa vruddhi dar aam taur par 30 fisadi se aage nahin jaati
 Everything here was growing at a rate of 100 percent in a year
 ” communist party ke liye sabase badi chintaa he saamaajik sthirataa
 The bigger problem than watching listed companies lose their market value is to see angry investors in Shanghai and Beijing vent their anger on stockbrokers
 in niveshkon main ritair logon se lekar college graduate tak hai
 He accepted the government's overblown claims about the market and put his savings in stocks, today his sharp earnings became clear in one stroke as the market broke
 avamulyan kaa asamanjasaisi kism kii chintaaon ke chalate 11 agast ko china ne achaanak doosraa hastkshep kiya, jab kendriya bank piples bank of china ne apni mudra yuan kaa mulya 2 fisadi gata diya
 This was the biggest decline since 1994
 yah kadam jis vakt uthaaya gaya, usase kuch halkon main yah dharna bani ki arthvyavastha main susti usase kahin zyada he, jitani beijing ne jaahir hone di thi or sarkaar apane niryaatkon kii madad karne ke liye kaaphi betaab he
 According to Cheung Kang School economics professor Li Wei, this intervention was more rational and appropriate
 ve kehete hai, “chini central bank kai saal se bazaar ko zyada nirdhaarit karne ke liye jor lagaataa rahaa he
 This time his wish was fulfilled
 2005 se hi yuan main acchhee-khaasi mulya vruddhi hoti rahi he, aise main is baat kii puri sambhaavna he ki aaj uskaa mulya apane asli mulya se bahut zyada ho gaya ho
 i believe that the experts have made a lot of sense of China's move in terms of currency
 ”sust padati vriddhichini arthvyavastha ke dhime hone se kitna kuch daanv par laga he, isaki ek tasviir guiaan shahar main dekhi ja sakati he, jo pashchimi guizou praant kii hari-bhari paharipoon or chaaval ke kheton ke bich banaaya ja rahaa he
 In February, the Chinese government approved the creation of a $ 10 billion high-tech zone, which would be the center of innovation for the whole of Western China
 guiaan new aria project kii ahmiyat isse samajhi ja sakati he ki ise pradhanmantri lee kekiyang ne hari jhandi dikhaai
 Not only this, it is an important foundation for Beijing's much larger plan to transform the economy and to avoid a long period of sluggishness or a "slowing down" of the slowing economy
 beijing ke yojanakaaron ko is baat main koi shaq nahin he ki sarkari niveshon or niryaat par tike jis aarthik model ne pichley do dashakon ke dauraan china kii vruddhi ko tej raftaar di, uskaa daur ab khatm hone ke kagaar par he
 The benefits of investment-based growth are now steadily declining, and it has put local governments in a growing debt crisis, who have spent money on infrastructure and real estate projects like water
 guiaan yojana ke pramukh chen yaan kehete hai ki ek puri software audyogic shrunkhlaa banane kaa iraadaa he
 The expenditure on this is estimated to reach $ 15 billion in the next two years
 is yojana ko sahaara dene ke liye chini sarkaar ko apni telecom companiyon china mobile or china unicom tathaa praudyogiki kii diggaj companiyon alibaba or shiomi kaa samarthan mil gaya he
 Despite this, the future of heavy projects like Guian are in the vortex of uncertainty due to increasing pressure on the banking sector
 haal hi main nirmaan sthalon par jane par vahaan gahamagahami ke kam hi nishaan dikhaai die
 On 21 August, the China Banking Regulatory Commission issued "encouraging banking institutions" guidelines to provide loans to large projects "supporting national strategies" to address concerns of cash shortages
 
 2008 main to beijing ne 586 arab dollar ke protsaahan package kii thili kaa munh khol diya tha, lekin aaj vruddhi ko ek jatke se raftaar dene ke liye uske tarkash main zyada tir nahin hai
 Impact on the world: This sluggishness will have a significant impact not only on China but the entire region
 2013 main party ke tisare adhiveshan main raashtrapati shi jinping ne sudhaar kaa ek mahatvakankshi agenda saamne rakhaa tha, jisamen sarkaar kii baari-bharkam companiyon kii takat main katautee tathaa sudhaar karne, bazaar ko zyada bhoomika dene or ahm kshetron ko nijee bhagidaari ke liye kholane kii baat kahi gai thi
 But after this market turmoil, the future of that agenda hangs in the balance

 Even a section of Congress has praised the abolition of special status of Jammu and Kashmir
 vishesh darja samaapt kiye jane ke baad ab rajya kaa darja bharat ke shesh rajyon ke baraabar ho gaya he
 This means that Jammu and Kashmir will no longer have its own constitution, flag and its own penal code
 saath hi, ab rajya ko yah bhi tay karne kaa adhikaar nahin hoga ki ghati main koun jameen kharid saktaa he or koun nahin
 After the end of special status, Amartya Sen says that people of other states should take a decision in this regard on things like buying land in Jammu and Kashmir
 unhone kaha, iskaa haq sirf kashmiriyon ke paas hi hona chahie kyonki ye unki jameen he

 web ne har kisi ko ghar de diya he apane hisaab se rahane ke liye
 He said that the identity had got from films and serials, but the web gave me the freedom to do what i wanted

 vaardaat ke videon main aap kuch awaz sunenge
 These sounds are on the other side of the border
 yani pakistan kii
 Voice of ordinary Pakistani and police officers residing in Balakot and Pak occupied Kashmir
 aap sunenge 26 farvari ke us hamale kaa puraa sach, jise pakistan aaj tak lagaataar jhuthlaata rahaa he
 This Pakistan's own voice will tell you that the mig-21 fighter of the Indian Air Force had entered the Pakistani border and wreaked havoc
 ye he pakistan kaa sting oparation
 So far Pakistan has been saying that we have just bombarded the forests and mountains to avenge the Pulwama attack
 wo ye bhi yahi kahata aa rahaa he ki uskaa epa-16 fiter bhi tabah nahin hua
 But today some different voices coming from inside Pakistan, which we are going to hear, will also shock and embarrass Pakistan
 kyonki ye aawaaj hamale kaa sach bataane ja rahi hai
 When our SIT team spoke to the local citizens and police officers of Balakot, it was found that there was a huge loss in the Indian Air Force attack
 paak army ke kai jawan maare gaye
 This is a sample
 us saboot kaa jise hasil karne ke liye hamane hindustan main hi baith kar pakistan ke kuch logon kaa sting oparation kiya
 So that we can find out where the bombs were fired by our mig-21 fighter to avenge the Pulwama attack and how much damage it caused
 is sting ke dauraan ajtak kii special invastigeshan team ne khaybar pakhtoon khwa main balakot ke aam logon ke saath pioke ke adhikariyon or police afasaron se bhi baat kii
 First of all, listen to the story of Mohammad Naeem's attack on the Indian Air Force
 naeem balakot kii ek masjid main kaam karte hai
 When we called him, he himself revealed his identity and location
 reporter- assalaam vaalekummo
 Naeem- Walekul Assalam
 main sehari kii nur masjid se bol rahaa hum
 Reporter- Is this mosque around Jabra (balakot)
 mo
 Naeem- Ji? Reporter- Is this mosque around Jabra in Khyber Pakhtun? naeem- ji
 
 ji
 The place where Naeem lives is very close to Jaba village in Balakot
 jahaan 26 farvari kii us raat aatanki campon par indian airforce ke ladaaku vimaanon ne hamalaa kiya
 Obviously we asked Naeem about the destruction and deaths in that airstrike
 jise sunate hi naeem ne ek behad chaunkaane vaala khulaasa kiya
 It was revealed that Pakistani soldiers along with terrorists have also been killed in the Indian attack
 reporter- kitne log shahid hue honge hindustani hamale main?mo
 Naeem- i have seen 4-5 men martyred from Pakistan Army
 reporter- pakistan army?mo
 Naeem- Ji
 
 Belonged to the army
 vahaan ke rihaayshi the
 Reporter- People of Pakistan Army are martyred? Mo
 naeem- ji army ke bhi hue hai
 Reporter- Is it true that these people have become disoriented? Mo
 naeem- ji
 
 jinaim naa sirf jaba teror camp par hue bhartiya hawaii hamale kii gavaahi de rahaa he, balki is hamale main pakistani army ke sainikon ke bhi maare jane kii pushti kar rahaa he
 Which is enough to tell that these terrorists have not only got the help of Pakistan but they are also engaged in their protection
 ajtak kii special invastigeshan team yaheen nahin rukii
 After this, we also explored other villages around Balakot and we spoke to Rahman, who works as a cleric in the mosque
 jinhone us raat qayamat ke manzar ko apni ankhon se dekha tha
 Reporter- What happened? Rahman- There is a house which is damaged
 reporter- aap vahiin the jab jaba main hamalaa hua he?rahamaan- ji bilkul
 It was three o'clock in the morning
 dhamaake se itani zordaar awaz hui ki log apane gharon se baahar nikal aae the
 There was a doom scene
 jo pakistan indian airforce ke hamale ko nakaar rahi thi
 His own people are praising it
 zordaar dhamaakaa hua
 Many buildings collapsed
 army ke log bhi maare gaye
 Disclosure was yet to be made
 ab hamane rukh kiya pioke yani pakistani kabze vaale kashmir kaa
 Because here too the Indian Air Force attacked terrorist camps
 or yaheen se pakistani epa-16 ne bhartiya seemaa main daakhil hone kii jurrat kii thi
 But when India presented the evidence, Pakistan refused to fly the F-16
 magar bhartiya sainya adhikariyon ne epa16 ke purze saamne rakhkar pakistan kaa jhooth benakaab kar diya
 But the official truth of the attack came to light when we called a Pakistani intelligence officer at a local police station in pok Bhimbar
 jis adhikari ne hamaara phone uthaaya usne bataaya ki use pakistani army ke order the ki epa-16 vimaan ke krash hone kii koi bhi bhanak kisi ko nahin lagani chahie
 Officer- Captain, my request is that the number you are talking to did not come up
 reporter- are kyonki ye headquarter kaa number he
 i am speaking from the Intelligence Department
 adhikari- sar mujhe ye hidaayat di gai he ki koi bhi jaankaree nahin deni he
 Reporter- Well, it was told
 
 Who gave you this instruction? Officer- We have a meeting with the officers of the Army
 usamen ye faisla hua he ki koi loose baat nahin kerani he kisi ke saath
 For fear of getting upset with the US, Pakistan has kept a lot of intelligence about the F-16 aircraft
 aisa isliye hua kyonki epa-16 vimaan ke liye hue samjhaute ke mutabik pakistan in vimaanon kaa istemaal sirf aatankwaad virdohi abhiyaanon ke liye hi kar saktaa he
 But after the Balakot attack, he deployed them against Indian aircraft
 haalanki hamaari baatcheet main bhimber police adhikari ne epa-16 vimaan ke malba milane kii baat se inkaar nahin kiya
 Rather he obeyed that order
 jo use pakistani sena kii taraf se use mili the
 That means guarding the site where the F-16 jet was shot down by the Indian Air Force
 reporter- heleydhikari- helloreporter- captain hanif bol rahaa hum
 Do one thing where the plane of Pakistan has crashed
 vahaan par aap jaaiye or vahaan par jaakar puure ariye ko aap dekhie ki vahaan koi bhi patrkaar naa pahunch paae
 Officer - Okereport - where Pakistan's plane has crashed
 main vahaan kii baat kar rahaa hum
 Let no one know that our plane has crashed
 adhikari- oke ji oke
 Despite all the precaution, the officer of Bhimbar police station finally accepted that Pakistani F-16 has crashed in pok and they have to stop its information from coming out
 mahatma gandhi kii 150 veen jayantisonia kaa bijepi par hamaladesh kii tarakkee congress kii denrashtrapita mahatma gandhi kii 150veen jayanti par congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ne bijepi or aresas ko nishane par lete hue kaha ki gandhi ke bataae hue raste par sirf congress party hi chali he
 At the same time, Sonia recalled former Prime Minister Narasimha Rao, saying that nehru-shastri-indira-rajiv-narasimha and Manmohan Singh have done the work of moving the country towards progress only by following the path of Mahatma Gandhi
 pichley kuch saal main bharat kii haalat jo hui he use dekhakar gandhi kii aatma kaaphi dukhi hogi
 At the conclusion of Gandhi's Congress padyatra at the foundation of India, Sonia Gandhi while addressing the party workers said that the foundation of India has Gandhi's principles
 congress hameshaa gandhiji ke siddhanton par chali, jo purna satta chaahate hai vah gandhi ko kabhi samaj nahin paae
 Gandhiji stood for love, not hatred
 jhooth kii raajnneeti vaale gandhi ko nahin samaj sakate
 Congress President Sonia Gandhi said that Kimhatma Gandhi inspired the whole world to take the path of truth and non-violence
 aaj bharat jahaan pahunchaa he vah gandhi ke raste par chalakar pahunchaa he
 Sonia said that it is easy to take the name of Mahatma Gandhi but it is difficult to follow his path
 gandhi kii aatma dukhisonia gandhi ne kaha ki jo asaty par aadhaarit raajnneeti kar rahe hai wo kaise samajhenge ki gandhi satya ke pujari the
 Those who are allowed to do everything for their power will understand that Gandhi was a priest of non-violence
 jinhen mauka milte hi apane aapako sarvesarva banane kii aadat ho wo gandhi ke niswaarth kaa mulya or loktantr ko kaise samajhenge
 Sonia said that Gandhi's self will be sad seeing the condition of the last 5 years
 aaj desh kii haalat bigadi he, kisaan pareshaan he, naujavaanon ke paas rojgaar nahin he, udyog dhandhe band ho rahe hai or mahilaayein gaanv main hi nahin balki shaharon main bhi surakshit nahin hai
 Sonia said that it was not the first to move away from Mahatma Gandhi's path in his direction
 pichley kuch saalon main sam-daam-dand-bhed kaa khulaa kaarobaar karke ve apane aapako bahut taqatvar samajhate hai
 Despite all this, India has not strayed because Gandhi's ideas are the cornerstone of our country
 sonia ne kaha ki bharat or gandhi ek duusare ke paryaay hai
 It is a different matter that some people nowadays try to reverse it
 kuch log chaahate hai ki gandhi nahin aresas desh kaa pratik ban jaae
 But this cannot happen, because the foundation of our country is laid on the idea of gandhi
 Thunderstorm with strong winds and rain likely to occur over places in and around Mahendragarh, Kosli, Gurugram, Manesar, Faridabad, Ballabhgarh, Noida and Greater Noida in the next two hours: India Meteorological Dept # Haryana The country should have its eye on what is happening in Kizhakkambalam
 yah bihar chunaav se bhi zyaada mahatvapurn he
 For the first time a company is contesting elections by forming a team under its corporate social responsibility
 main corporate kanoon kaa gyaata nahin hum, isliye nahin bataa saktaa ki corporate saamaajik daayitv ke tahat kharch hone vaale paise par chhot ke jo praavdhaan hai, ve raajnneetik gatividhiyaan chalaane ke liye hai yaa nahin
 Panchayat elections are a very political activity
 anna-kitex kerala kii sabase badi garment company he
 He has a factory in Kizhakkambalam
 company kaa daawa he ki raajnneetik dal uske vikaas ke kaaryon main baadha daal rahe hai
 The company wants to make this panchayat an ideal panchayat by 2020
 vaise bharat sarkaar bhi kaaphi rupaya kharch kar desh bhar main adarsh panchayat bana rahi he
 The Prime Minister has spoken to the mps to start the Adarsh gram Yojana
 bhale hi kai jagahon par yah yojana kaagazi sabit ho rahi he, lekin isaki soch main to koi kami nahin dikhti he, isliye company kaa adarsh banane kaa daawa naitikta ke paimaane se ucch koti kaa nahin thahartaa he
 Company representative Jacob has told 'indian Express' that he had planned to contest elections with the CPM too, but could not succeed
 logon kii raay lene ke baad company ne apane str par ummidavaaron kaa chunaav kiya he
 The candidates range from Left to Leader-activists in Congress
 jaikab kaa kahana he ki company ne gaanv kii sadakon se lekar pani aapurti tak main kaaphi nivesh kiya he, lekin congress ke prabhutv vaali panchayat ne uske vikaas ke kai kaamon ko roak diya he
 The report did not provide an answer to how the company did other things in the village while under Congress
 panchayat ke nirvatmaan adhyaksh joli baby kaa kahana he ki company panchayat par apana niyantran kaayam karnaa chaahati he, taaki company ke hit ke liye manamaani kar sake
 The panchayat has not given a license to the company in some cases
 baby kaa kahana he ki pani or daldal ne bhoomi ko pradooshit kiya he, jabaki company is aarope ko nakaarti he, or kahati he ki kai sarkari agenciyon ne unhen clin chit di he
 What is happening in Kerala is not a common phenomenon
 companiyaan agar corporate saamaajik daayitv ke tahat kiye jane vaale kaaryon ke badale panchayaton par kabza kar len to kya hoga
 How political parties will deal with corporate dominated companies
 muddon ko lekar donon kaa sambandh kaisaa hoga
 Will political parties be excluded
 ek samay hota tha, jab netaaon ne bahubaliyon kii madad lee, baad main bahubaliyon ne kaha ki hamaari madad se vidhayak banate hai, to ham hi kyon na ban jaaen
 After many years and many elections, the people have taken back the land of politics from the muscle forces
 abhi bhi raajnneeti kaa bada hissaa in bahubaliyon ke kabze main he
 Are companies also going to do this now? tippaniyan This incident raises many new questions
 raajnneeti main bhi buraai he
 Many candidates or leaders of a political party are corrupt, tainted and rebel
 mukhiya se lekar jila panchayat ke sadsy paise lekar vot dete hai yaa dilavaate hai
 Despite all this, there is democracy
 phir corporate ke aane se loktantr par kya asar padegaa, ise lekar sochaa janaa chahie
 No company working in companies can speak out of interest
 aap bijepi main rahete hue shatrughna sinha kii tarah party kii aalochana kar sakate hai, lekin kya aap aisa kisi company kaa ummidavaar banane par kar sakate hai
 It is also true that due to the whip, most of the party's mps have also started behaving like employees of the company
 sab kuch party ke liye karte hai or party ke liye chup rahete hai yaa bolte hai
 There is a need to be vigilant about the foundation being laid in this village of Kerala
 companiyon ke sansaadhan ke aage janata ke hit tik nahin sakenge
 Roads, electricity, water and schools are the responsibility of the government
 behatar he sarkaar hi nibhaae
 As the government runs away from these obligations, others will come
 duusare aaenge to apana daawa karenge
 But what about democracy
 kya kisi company kii banaai team yaa manch yaa party kaa ummidavaar janaakankshaon kaa pratinidhitiv kar saktaa he, isliye thodaa dakshin kii taraf bhi dekh lijie, bihar to haiye he
 
 
 anna-kitex is the largest garment company in Kerala
 kijhaakamblam main uskaa kaarkaana laga he
 The company claims that political parties are hindering its development work
 company is panchayat ko 2020 tak adarsh panchayat bananaa chaahati he
 By the way, the Government of India is also making Adarsh panchayat across the country by spending a lot of money
 pradhanmantri ne to saansadon ko adarsh gram yojana shuru karne kii baat kii he
 Even though the scheme is proving to be paper in many places, it does not seem to be lacking in its thinking, so the claim of making the company ideal does not stand high on the morality scale
 company ke pratinidhi jaikab ne 'indian express' se kaha he ki unhone sipiem se bhi milakar chunaav ladane kii yojana banaai thi, magar kaamyaab nahin ho sake
 After taking public opinion, the company has selected candidates at its level
 ummidavaaron main left se lekar congress main netaa-kaaryakarta rah chuke log hai
 Jacob says the company has invested heavily in village roads to water supply, but the Congress-dominated panchayat has stopped many of its development work
 report main is sawaal kaa jawaab nahin mila ki phir congress ke rahete company ne gaanv main baaki chizein kaise kar leen
 Jolly Baby, the outgoing president of the panchayat, says that the company wants to exercise control over the panchayat, so as to make it arbitrary in the interest of the company
 panchayat ne company ko kuch maamalon main license nahin diya he
 Baby says that water and marsh have polluted the land, while the company denies the charge, and says that several government agencies have given him a clean chit
 kerala main jo ho rahaa he, vah saamaanya ghatana nahin he
 What will happen if companies take possession of panchayats in exchange for work done under corporate social responsibility? company ke prabhutv vaale corporate ke saath raajnneetik dal kaise bartaav karenge
 How will the two be related to the issues
 kya raajnneetik dal baahar kar die jaaenge
 There was a time when the leaders took the help of the Bahubalis, later the Bahubalis said that with our help, we become legislators, so why should we not become one
 kai saal or kai chunaav lagaakar janata ne raajnneeti kii zamin bahubaliyon se waapas lee he
 Still a large part of politics is in the possession of these musclemen
 kya companiyaan bhi ab aisa karne ja rahi hai
 The comments yah ghatana kai nae sawaal paidaa karti he
 There is also evil in politics
 raajnneetik dal ke bahut se ummidavaar yaa netaa bhrasht hote hai, daagi or baagi hote hai
 From the headman to the members of the Zilla Panchayat, they vote or get money
 in sabake baavjood loktantr to he hi
 Then what should be the impact of democracy with the arrival of corporate, it should be thought about
 companiyon main kaam karne vaala koi bhi company hit ke baahar nahin bol saktaa he
 You can criticize the party while in BJP, like Shatrughan Sinha, but can you do so on becoming a candidate of a company
 yah bhi sahi he ki vip ke kaaran ab party ke zyaadaatar saansad bhi company ke karmchaaree kii tarah hi vyavhaar karne lage hai
 Do everything for the party and keep quiet or speak for the party
 kerala ke is gaanv main jo buniyaad pad rahi he, use lekar sachet rahane kii zarurat he
 Public interest will not be able to stand in front of the resources of companies
 sadak, bijli, pani or skool sarkaar kii zimmedaari hai
 It is better to follow the government
 jaise-jaise sarkaar in dayitvon se bhaagegi, duusare aaenge
 If others come, they will claim themselves
 lekin loktantr kaa kya
 Can a candidate from a company-created team or platform or party represent the aspirations, so look a little to the south, Bihar is there

 kya raajnneetik dal baahar kar die jaaenge
 There was a time when the leaders took the help of the Bahubalis, later the Bahubalis said that with our help, we become legislators, so why should we not become one
 kai saal or kai chunaav lagaakar janata ne raajnneeti kii zamin bahubaliyon se waapas lee he
 Still a large part of politics is in the possession of these musclemen
 kya companiyaan bhi ab aisa karne ja rahi hai
 The comments yah ghatana kai nae sawaal paidaa karti he
 There is also evil in politics
 raajnneetik dal ke bahut se ummidavaar yaa netaa bhrasht hote hai, daagi or baagi hote hai
 From the headman to the members of the Zilla Panchayat, they vote or get money
 in sabake baavjood loktantr to he hi
 Then what should be the impact of democracy with the arrival of corporate, it should be thought about
 companiyon main kaam karne vaala koi bhi company hit ke baahar nahin bol saktaa he
 You can criticize the party while in BJP, like Shatrughan Sinha, but can you do so on becoming a candidate of a company
 yah bhi sahi he ki vip ke kaaran ab party ke zyaadaatar saansad bhi company ke karmchaaree kii tarah hi vyavhaar karne lage hai
 Do everything for the party and keep quiet or speak for the party
 kerala ke is gaanv main jo buniyaad pad rahi he, use lekar sachet rahane kii zarurat he
 Public interest will not be able to stand in front of the resources of companies
 sadak, bijli, pani or skool sarkaar kii zimmedaari hai
 It is better to follow the government
 jaise-jaise sarkaar in dayitvon se bhaagegi, duusare aaenge
 If others come, they will claim themselves
 lekin loktantr kaa kya
 Can a candidate from a company-created team or platform or party represent the aspirations, so look a little to the south, Bihar is there
 
 
 panchayat ke nirvatmaan adhyaksh joli baby kaa kahana he ki company panchayat par apana niyantran kaayam karnaa chaahati he, taaki company ke hit ke liye manamaani kar sake
 The panchayat has not given a license to the company in some cases
 baby kaa kahana he ki pani or daldal ne bhoomi ko pradooshit kiya he, jabaki company is aarope ko nakaarti he, or kahati he ki kai sarkari agenciyon ne unhen clin chit di he
 What is happening in Kerala is not a common phenomenon
 companiyaan agar corporate saamaajik daayitv ke tahat kiye jane vaale kaaryon ke badale panchayaton par kabza kar len to kya hoga
 How political parties will deal with corporate dominated companies
 muddon ko lekar donon kaa sambandh kaisaa hoga
 Will political parties be excluded
 ek samay hota tha, jab netaaon ne bahubaliyon kii madad lee, baad main bahubaliyon ne kaha ki hamaari madad se vidhayak banate hai, to ham hi kyon na ban jaaen
 After many years and many elections, the people have taken back the land of politics from the muscle forces
 abhi bhi raajnneeti kaa bada hissaa in bahubaliyon ke kabze main he
 Are companies also going to do this now? tippaniyan This incident raises many new questions
 raajnneeti main bhi buraai he
 Many candidates or leaders of a political party are corrupt, tainted and rebel
 mukhiya se lekar jila panchayat ke sadsy paise lekar vot dete hai yaa dilavaate hai
 Despite all this, there is democracy
 phir corporate ke aane se loktantr par kya asar padegaa, ise lekar sochaa janaa chahie
 No company working in companies can speak out of interest
 aap bijepi main rahete hue shatrughna sinha kii tarah party kii aalochana kar sakate hai, lekin kya aap aisa kisi company kaa ummidavaar banane par kar sakate hai
 It is also true that due to the whip, most of the party's mps have also started behaving like employees of the company
 sab kuch party ke liye karte hai or party ke liye chup rahete hai yaa bolte hai
 There is a need to be vigilant about the foundation being laid in this village of Kerala
 companiyon ke sansaadhan ke aage janata ke hit tik nahin sakenge
 Roads, electricity, water and schools are the responsibility of the government
 behatar he sarkaar hi nibhaae
 As the government runs away from these obligations, others will come
 duusare aaenge to apana daawa karenge
 But what about democracy
 kya kisi company kii banaai team yaa manch yaa party kaa ummidavaar janaakankshaon kaa pratinidhitiv kar saktaa he, isliye thodaa dakshin kii taraf bhi dekh lijie, bihar to haiye he

 They are dipping their fork in a bowl of chowmin and manchurian gravy with great readiness

 "it is 7 o'clock in the evening and has just returned to Circular Road, 10, the official residence of Mother Rabri Devi in patna, after addressing four public meetings in the stunning Khagadia, Madhepura and Madhubani districts
 pita, rashtriya janata dal pramukh lalu prasad ke chaara ghotaale main doshi tehraae jane ke baad nyaayik hiraasat main hone or rabari ke sakriy raajnneeti se kadam peeche khinchne ke baad ve hi rajd ke karnadhaar hai
 Tejashwi, 29, the younger of Lalu Factarloo's two sons, knows that he has to take on a bigger responsibility
 2019 kaa loksabhaa chunaav rajd kii pehali aisi badi chunavi ladaai he, jisamen uskaa netritv sanbhaalane ke liye lalu prasad maujuud nahin hai
 It would be a matter of fact to state that the party will feel strongly about Lalu's lack of political prudence, charismatic personality and effective speech style
 haalanki lalu kaa apana sansadeey kariyar to sitambar, 2013 main hi samaapt ho gaya tha jab chaara ghotaale ke pehle maamle main doshi tehraae jane ke baad unki loksabhaa sadsyta chali gai thi or ve aage bhi chunaav ladgaye ke ayogy qaraar de die gaye the
 But due to his deep association with the people of Bihar, he remained in a big political position
 jamaanat par baahar rahete hue unhone 2014 ke loksabhaa or 2015 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main rajd ke liye prachaar kiya
 a RJD leader said, "lalu Prasad has a strong ability to carry out the campaign
" ve matadaataaon kii nabj bhaanp lete hai or 'idhar-udhar' main pade logon ko apane paksh main mode sakate hai
 They have always been going to add votes
 "lekin tejasvi ko is baat kaa shrey jaataa he ki unhone un logon ko khamosh kar diya he jo disambar, 2017 main lalu ke jail jane ke baad rajd kaa netritv sanbhaalane kii unki kaabiliyat par sawaal uthaa rahe the
 Since then, Tejashwi, the Leader of the Opposition in the Bihar Legislative Assembly, has continued his winning streak
 july, 2017 main mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ke janata dal (united) ke mahagathbandhan chhodkar endie main shaamil hone ke baad se rajd ne rajya main teen upachunaav jite hai—jokihat, jahanabad vidhansabha siten or arriya loksabhaa seat
 The leader who came out of the struggle as a politician clearly shows the ability of Tejashwi to connect people
 11 april ko matdaan vaale ek kshetra jamui main unhone ek sabha main darshakon main se ek bachche ko manch par bulaayaa or usase poocha, ''tender jaanate ho? financial bid kya hota he?" bachche ko in sawaalon par bagale jhaankate dekhakar tejasvi ne bheed kii taraf mudakar kaha, ''main bhi isi umr kaa tha
 Now tell, can a 10-12 year old child know what a tender is? Nevertheless, CBI registered a case against me alleging irregularities in railway tenders
 " unki is baat par darshakon main unke prati samarthan kaa josh umada
 Tejashwi had recorded his point
 haalanki, ab bhi unke liye seekhney ke hi din hai
 In 2014, the NDA vs rjd-congress and JD (U) -BSP alliance were pitted against each other
 is baar rajd kii aguai vaala gathbandhan endie ke saath sidhi takkar main he jisamen bhaajapa, jad (you) or ram vilaas paswan kii lok janashakti party (lojpa) shaamil hai
 The rjd's original muslim-yadav base, 31 per cent of Bihar's total population, has proved to be decisive in any multi-cornered contest
 lekin kisi sidhe mukaable main shaayad vah naakaafi sabit ho
 Stunning also has some holes in his armor
 bade bhai tej pratap ne party netritv or party ummidavaaron ke khilaaf bolkar aksar rajd ko asahaj sthiti main laa khadaa kiya he
 Tej Pratap, troubled by being in the shadow of Tejashwi, says, Mama is playing at the hands of Sadhu Yadav
 haalanki tejasvi ne sab kuch saamaanya jataane kii koshish kii he
 He met Tej Pratap on his birthday on 16 April and described the Lok Sabha elections as "a greater war for democracy"
 bihar main rajd ke paanch dalon ke mahagathbandhan main congress ke alaava upendra kushvaha kii rashtriya lok samta party, jithan ram maanjhi kii hindustan avam morcha or mukesh sahani kii vikasshil insaan party shaamil hai
 Opponents also have doubts about the ability of Tejashwi to cross Hoshiyar Rajad's boat
 patna main bhaajapa ke ek varisht netaa kaa kahana tha, ''kitni bhi koshish kar len par tejasvi lalu prasad nahin hai
 "they point to this when Tejashwi launched a campaign against the Modi government's announcement of 10 per cent reservation in education / jobs for the economically backward in the general category
 lalu ke kehane par chede gaye abhiyaan main anusuchit jatiyon, janajatiyon or anya pichde virgon (obisi) ke liye maujuuda aarakshan main vruddhi kii bhi maang kii gai
 Many people said that the RJD lost the opportunity to further strengthen its base in this matter
 bhaajapa netaa kaa kahana tha, ''lalu hote to unhone is mudde kaa istemaal agadi or pichhadi jatiyon ke bich daraar ko or chaudaa karne main kiya hota
 The wind of Tejaswi's expedition probably came out in the middle
 "haalanki ek anya bhaajapa netaa kaa maananaa tha ki lalu kii gaiyr-maujuudagi unke virodhiyon ke liye 'dudhari talwaar' sareekhee bhi ho sakati he
 "there is a strong possibility that Lalu's supporters vote with full force in sympathy
" " rajd ko bhi is kshamta kaa andaja he
 Rabri Devi has also released a video message alleging that the BJP is plotting to poison the RJD chief in judicial custody
 tejasvi ne lalu ke mulakatiyon par pabandi ke jharkhand jail prashasan ke faisle ko 'amanviya' kaha he
 The tana-banaidavas and many of their sub-castes of the Yadav Empire are the largest caste-group in Bihar and they account for 14% of the population
 unheen kii badaulat lalu 1990 main chunavi maidan main chamake or pehali baar bihar ke mukhyamantri bane
 a portion of the Yadav youth voted for the BJP in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 lekin yadav vot bank ke bharose lalu 2015 main phir se satta main laute or rajd kii ladi gai siton par party ne 44 fisadi vot batore
 Analysts believe that this strength of their votes will remain intact in 2019 as well
 aabaadi main 17 fisadi hissaa rakhane vaale musalamaanon ke saath milakar lalu kaa muslim-yadav mail khaasi takat rakhata he
 The rjd-congress had a vote share of 29 per cent in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 atyant pichde varg yani ibisi kaa aabaadi main 30 fisadi hissaa he or 2006 main jab se nitish ne panchayaton main 20 fisadi siten unke liye arakshit karne kaa faisla kiya, ve majbootee se unka saath dete rahe hai
 The panchayats of the state, which were earlier known as jagirs of forward castes and domineering backward castes, are now considered as seats dominated by ebcs
 nitish kii 2009 ke loksabhaa or 2010 tathaa 2015 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main jeet main ibisi kii khaas bhoomika rahi he
 But by separating Manjhi and Kushwaha from the NDA and joining Sahni's party in the camp, Tejashwi is hoping that he will beat the NDA
 kushvaha (7 fisadi) obisi main sabase bada gaiyr-yadav samooh hai
 Similarly, Manjhi is also hopeful of drawing Dalit votes with 4 per cent of Mushar votes and the votes of Sahani mariners can be brought towards the grand alliance

 The accident occurred at 9
50 am when the aircraft crashed into the airport boundary wall and went into a water purification plant just five minutes after taking flight due to a technical flaw
 dekhen haadase se judi tasviren : Chhattisgarh is at the top in terms of power generation in the country
 yahaan rojaanaa lagbhag saadhe gyaarah hajaar megawatt bijli kaa utpaadan hota he
 There are hundreds of small and big power houses in the state, which generate electricity from both thermal and hydral systems
 chhattisgarh, desh kaa ek maatr aisa rajya he jahaan sarplus bijli he
 Means more than consumption
 rajya main rojaanaa paanch hajaar megawatt se zyada bijli kaa utpaadan hota he
 Generally, all states depend on the power grid and NTPC of the central government in terms of power generation and consumption
 lekin chhattisgarh sarkaar ke khud power janareshan ke chaar mega plant hai
 The government of Chhattisgarh sells electricity to many states including Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Telangana
 lekin is rajya ke 27 jilon main saadhe chaar lakh ghar aise hai, jinhen aaj bhi bijli naseeb nahin hui he
 Neither the village had electricity before independence nor after independence
 bijli kab muhaiyaahogi is bare main kuch pukhta taur par nahin kaha ja saktaa
 However, the BJP government of the state claims that electricity will be delivered to all villages by March 2019
 desh ke ek maatr power hub kaa darja vaale chhattisgarh rajya ke jis jile main bhi jaaie vahaan aapako kai chote-bade bijli ghar dikhaai denge
 Somewhere electricity is being generated from coal and somewhere with water
 yahi nahin saikado kii taadaad main aise bijli ghar hai jo dhan ke chhilake or bhuse ko jalaakar bijli paidaa karte he
 There are usually two dozen such plants
 raipur ke alaava korba, raigarh, jaanjgir champa, bilaspur, ambikapur, jashpur or baikunthpur korea wo jile he jahaan rojaanaa hajaaron megawatt bijli kaa utpaadan hota he
 Not only Chhattisgarh, many states of the country illuminate from these districts
 rajya ke mukhyamantri raman singh ke mutabik naksali is maamle main roda atakaate hai
 They uproot the power pole
 sarvice line nasht kar dete hai
 They threaten the workers engaged in the work of putting electricity and stop the work
 haalanki unhone aashwast kiya he ki aane vaale do saalo main rajya ke sabhi gaanv main bijli pahunchaa di jaaegi
 He informed that DPR has been sent to the Central Government for this
 is par hone vaala saath fisadi vyay centre, das fisadi rajya sarkaar or tees fisadi power janareshan company vahan karegi
 There are four and a half lakh houses in 27 districts of Chhattisgarh where there is no electricity even today
 kai ilaako main to saalo se bijli ke pole lage hai, lekin bijli nahin pahunchi
 There are 164 villages in these 27 districts of Chhattisgarh where the settled people still live by burning torches and lanterns and candles at night
 in graminon ne ab roshni kii aas chhod di he
 Since in 2001, when Chhattisgarh was separated from Madhya Pradesh, a new state was formed, the people here were told that now there will be electricity not only in their village but in every house but even after so many years
 chhattisgarh ke gathan ko 17 biit gaye lekin in gaanv main bijli kaa dur-dur tak ata-pataa nahin he
 People here are still living like the primitive era
 jashpur jila mukhyalay se maatr 5 kilometre dur jashpur block kaa timrma gaanv, ambikapur se maatr 15 kilometre dur kuberpur or dangbandhi kaa ye najaara he jahaan log andhere main rahane ko majaboor hai
 As soon as the sun comes out, the Chahal initiative starts in these villages
 or suryaast hote hi log gharo kaa rukh kar lete hai
 Because, there is no electricity for many kilometers in these villages
 chhattisgarh main rojaanaa kam se kam saadhe gyaarah hajaar megawatt bijli kaa utpaadan hota he
 Chhattisgarh Government's share in it is about 3500 MW daily, n
 tii
 P
 si
 About 4 thousand MW and private power houses generate about 3500 MW of electricity daily
 varsh 2001 main is rajya main congress kii sarkaar ai
 Ajit Jogi ruled as Chief Minister for three years
 iske baad 2003 main hue vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi satta main ai, tab se lagaataar teesri baar mukhyamantri raman singh ne satta kii bagdor sanbhali hui he
 He is the only Chief Minister of BJP who has become the leader of the Chief Minister's chair for the longest time
 12 disambar ko wo 14 saal pure kar lenge
 Assembly elections are due in the state in the year 2018, obviously he will complete 15 years as the Chief Minister
 is sab ke baavjood yah rajya roshan hone vaala nahin he kyonki un saikado gaanvon main bijli pahunchnaa tedi kheer he
 Anyway, the blue print of electricity supply in those villages is not ready yet
 rajya ke mukhyamantri kii daleel he ki naksali gaanv main bijli pahunchane nahin de rahe hai
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that by 2022 electricity will be delivered to all the states of the country
 isi kadi main chhattisgarh kii bijepi sarkaar ne lakshya tay kiya he ki march 2019 tak pradesh ke har ghar ko roshan kiya jayega
 For this, in the first batch, the DPR has been sent to the central government to electrify 4 lakh 65 thousand houses under the Centre's good fortune scheme
 lekin ise saal bhar baad bhi manjuuri nahin mil pai he
 Apparently in 2019, electricity will not reach hundreds of villages in this state

 I'm absolutely shocked
 This is too awful for words
 So tragic i don't know what to say
 Rest in peace, Sunanda — Mehr Tarar (@mehrtarar) January 17, 2014 In fact, Sunanda Pushkar has accused her husband Tharoor that her husband has an 'affair' with Pakistani journalist Meher Tarar, so she needs a divorce

 Hi
 
 
 main raveesh kumaar
 Electoral politics in Delhi has been happening daily for the last one year, just the vote will be held on 7 February and the result will come on 10
 queshchan ekadam aasaan he ki koun jitegaa
 Every hour AAP vs
 bjp's paper is getting out by making a trend on twitter-facebook
 baaki jo taff queshchan hai, unhen last main yaa sabase last main atempt karne ke liye chhod diya ja rahaa he
 If this condition is of Delhi, then you can guess what happens in the rest of the country
 ramlila maidan ne dilli kii raajnneeti ko na sirf badla, balki raajnneeti main kuch nae sawaal khadey kar die
 Recall then how much excitement there was to end corruption
 lokapal abhi nahin to ab lao kaa naaraa lagata tha
 People from every party used to come and show support
 middle class apane gaalon par tirangaa rang kar aata tha
 But now there is fierce silence on Lokpal
 shanivaar ko bijepi kii raily main pradhanmantri ne kaha ki bhrashtachar se mukti kaa abhiyaan main jahaan baithta hum vahiin se shuru kiya he
 And i am going to bring it slowly to the street
 jabaki is ramlila ne yah kaha tha ki neeche se lekar upar tak kaa bhrashtachar lokapal saadhegaa
 This Lokpal will also keep an eye on the Prime Minister
 lokapal ko lekar congress or aam aadmi party kii taraf se koi sakriy sangharsh nahin he
 For two years, Delhi used to chant Lokpal Lokpal, sometimes with the help of questions of police reform or change in the system
 ham kyon nahin poochhate ki jis lokapal ne itnaa bhuuchaal paidaa kiya, use lekar ab vaisaa janadbaav kyon nahin he
 All the baseless people born in Ramlila Maidan on black money have been lost in the complex of law
 lokapal ko lekar na to koi nayak he, na khalanaayak
 These people who came in support of Lokpal, would have thought of themselves as x Freedom Fighter in Black and White Frame
 yahi vah taff queshchan he jise sabane last ke liye chhod rakhaa he
 Each side is winning two and four shortcomings and merits
 galatiyon or galatchhemiyon kaa jandhan khaataa to sabake hisse main khulaa hua he, lekin vot dene vaala is baar kin sawaalon ko lekar is baar dilli ke matdaan kendron par jayega
 The power has made Delhi's political parties creative
 dilli kii janata iskaa namoona rose nae-nae naaron se saje bade-bade hording dekhati hi hogi
 People sitting in millions of cars stuck in jams, listening to all kinds of jingles on FM radio, are training in the focal point of becoming great voters of 21st century India's capital
 ek radio vigyaapan main arvind kejariwal eko sound yani anugunj ke sahare aahvaan karte hue kisi bujurg mahila ko aashwast kar rahe hai ki mata ji galati ho gai magar ham kahin gaye nahin the
 i am coming to serve you
 vahiin bijepi ke vigyaapan main do dost sun na, suna na tip kii baaten karte hue aam aadmi party ko nautankibaz bataa rahe hai ki yaar is baar to bilkul nahin
 In Delhi, the leaders who are looking for survival by forming an organization in the name of Purvanchal and Uttarakhand have now found a place in every party
 tikat to tikat ab vigyaapan bhi logon kii catagori ke hisaab se ban rahaa he
 Bihari type Bhojpuri Hindi has been used in a BJP radio advertisement
 jaat-paat kii tarah purvanchal dilli kii raajnneeti kaa votbank he, jo iskaa kshetriyakaran karne main laga he
 At the same time, Congress is trying to be the third angle in this fight, pulling the BJP and Aam Aadmi Party
 dilli main is baar yahaan ke log notice kar rahe honge ki kaise vigyapanon-hordings main congress ne vaapasi kii he
 a year ago, the withdrawal of the Congress through hoardings disappearing from the ground is somewhat surprising
 congress ke naare hai vikaas kii door kahin chhot na jaae
 We do politics of brotherhood, not communalism
 kai jagahon par yah naaraa likhaa he ki is baar soch samaj kar vot dena
 Do not get seduced by anyone
 jaise 15 saal tak congress ko chunane vaali janata ko kisi ne bahaka liya tha
 He pushed Congress to number three without any thought
 ab netaa kii jagah slogan likhane vaale script riter chunaav ladenge to yahi sab dekhne sunne ko milegaa
 BJP may be ahead on hoarding but AAP and Congress are not far behind
 lokapal ke samay desh kii nazar dilli par thi lekin ab dilli kii nazar kahaan he, khud dilli ko bhi nahin pataa
 For reference, the Prime Minister takes some of the statements of Narendra Modi's meeting and Arvind Kejriwal's meeting in Nazafgarh
 dilli main pachaas lakh se bhi zyada log jhuggi jhopadiyon main rahete hai
 The condition of some colonies is worse than slums
 kabhi in coloniyon main jaakar dekhiyegaa or inaki badtar or amanviya haalat ko lekar sawaal kijiega
 And also believe in that claim that within seven years now, by 2022, all the Delhiites will be built solid houses
 hindustan desh main punarvaas kaa aisa shandaar record abhi tak kisi bhi rajya or kisi bhi dal kii sarkaar main nahin bana he
 The politics of regularizing illegal colonies is another sad aspect of the politics of Delhi, in which every election is shown a pleasant dream
 pradhanmantri ne kaha ki modi peeth main chura ghonpane vaala nahin he
 He also redefined the limits of work and said that anyone who knows how to drive can cook food
 gaadi chalaane vaale ko gaadi kaa kaam diya to acha karegaa naa
 Therefore, those who have the ability to sit on the pavement to stop the path, have the ability to do the dharna, have the ability to agitate on the day to come, give them that work
 vaise bahut se gaadi chalaane vaale zarur acha khaanaa bhi banaate honge
 Kejriwal is counting his 49 days of work at the Center as against the bjp's seven months
 utsaah ke lihaaz se to thik he magar kya vaaki ye paimaana sahin he
 In Najafgarh, Arvind said that the BJP overturned its promise
 logon ne to kahana chaalu kar diya ki ye you-turn sarkaar he
 Reverses what she says
 puri dilli main pichley chunaavon main inhone hording lagaae the ji ki 30% daam kam karenge bijli ke
 What happened, they increased electricity prices twice
 15% or badhaa die, kam ek paisa nahin kiya
 Reverse what he said
 arvind ne cancer or anya dawaaon ke daam badhaaye jane kaa mudda bhi uthaaya
 If the mood is not for Lokpal, then the people of Delhi should take to the streets with full statehood
 banane ke liye nahin balki sabhi dalon se haath jodakar kehane ke liye ki ab bas
 Do not cook in the name of full state
 kam se kam ek ishyu par thage jane kaa afsos to nahin hoga
 There is no one who did not cheat Delhi on this issue
 to aap kya sun kar, kya soch kar vot karne ja rahe hai
 Will you decide the question or is the script writer writing slogan? a post shared by Neha Dhupia (@nehadhupia) on Nov 13, 2018 at 1:30am PSTA post shared by Neha Dhupia (@nehadhupia) on May 10, 2018 at 1:15am PDTA post shared by Neha Dhupia (@nehadhupia) on Aug 24, 2018 at 5:44am PDT Results expected to be good this time assam main neshnal register of citijan (NRC) draft jari hue ek haftaa biit chukaa he
 Those whose names were not in the NRC list could fill the form again from August 7, but the date of receipt of the form has now been changed to August 10
 yah form 30 agast se enarasi seva kendron main log jamaa kar sakenge
 On the other hand, after the release of the NRC draft, the police has made 7 check points to prevent illegal infiltrators in Meghalaya, where people coming from Assam will be closely monitored and those declared illegal will be prevented from entering the state
 is bare main espi debangashu sangama ne media ko bataaya ki, "ghuspaithiyon ko rokane ke liye hamane check point banaae hai, isse assam se aane-jane waalon kii jaanch ho rahi he
 People's identity card is being seen at the check point
 taaki wo bharat ke naagarik hai yaa nahin isaki pushti ho sake
 "sangma further stated that West Khasi Hills, ri-bhoi, Jaintia Hills, Garo Hills district is near the border of Assam
 yahaan padane vaale check points par ghuspaithiyon ko rokane ke liye team banaai gai he
 After this action, Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonwal held a phone conversation with Meghalaya CM Conard Sangma
 unhone assam or meghalaya ke bich yatayaat saral karne kii baat kahi
 So that people do not have to face trouble at the check point
 enarasi ke jari hone ke baad haal hi main yah khabaren saamne ai thi ki assam se meghalaya jane vaale kai logon ko ghuspaithiya bataakar durvyavhaar kiya gaya tha
 In fact, the whole issue came to the headlines when the Khasi Student Union (KSU) made its check points at the Meghalaya border after the NRC draft was released
 enarasi kendron par kadi suraksha
 
 
 It is expected that lakhs of people will reach 2500 service centers for claims
 ise dekhte hue sicurity ke tagade bandobast die gaye hai
 The police have received intelligence inputs that service centers may be attacked during the NRC review

 mangalvaar ko japan ke kob shahar main yah press confrence hui thi
 Watch the video of the press conference that is getting viral - pakistan dwaara lahore-dillimaitri bas seva ko radd karne ke faisle ke baad bharat ne bhi somvaar se is par roak laga di
 On Monday, a senior official from the Delhi Transport Corporation informed that the delhi-lahore bus service has been canceled
 isse pehle shanivaar ko pakistan ke sanchaar evam dak seva mantri muraad said ne is maitri bas seva ko somvaar se nilambit karne kaa elaan kiya tha
 a corporation official said that a DTC bus was scheduled to leave for Lahore at 6 am on Monday but the bus did not leave due to Pakistan's decision to suspend the bus service
 ditisi ke ek bayaan main kaha gaya he, ‘‘dilli-lahore bas seva nilambit karne ke pakistan ke faisle ko dekhte hue ditisi 12 agast se (dilli se lahore ke liye) bas bhejne main samarth nahin he

 The delhi-lahore bus service first started in February 1999 but was suspended after the 2001 terrorist attack on Parliament
 baad main ise july, 2003 main phir se behaal kiya gaya tha
 After the Pulwama terror attack in February this year and then the Balakot airstrikes in response, the bus service continued to run after the relations of the two countries deteriorated but it had very few passengers
 apane ghar main hi aarope jhel rahi aam aadmi party ke khilaaf ab bijepi bhi usee ke vidhayakon ke bayanon ko hathiyaar ke taur par istemaal kar rahi he
 On Monday, the BJP made a big charge on the Aam Aadmi Party
 bijepi ne kaha ki party ke bheetar sex scandle chal rahe hai or iskaa khulaasa khud party ke hi vidhayak kar rahe hai
 Delhi BJP president Satish Upadhyay alleged that the party's MLA Colonel Devendra Sehrawat has made serious allegations against Kejriwal and his people but Delhi's non-resident CM Kejriwal did not respond to them
 unhone devendra saharaavat ke twits kaa hawala dete hue kaha ki unhone aam aadmi party ke patel nagar daftar main kaam karne vaali ek ladki kaa zikr kiya he, jiskaa shaareerik shoshan kiya gaya or chah maheene baad uskaa garbhpaat nimrana main karaayaa gaya
 Asked for Kejriwal, Upadhyay said that Aerwind Kejriwal should give his clarification on this charge and tell who the girl was and who exploited her
 bijepi ne aarope lagayaa ki party ke bheetar hui is ghatana ke liye khud siem kejariwal jimmedaar hai kyonki unheen ke sangrakshan main ye sab ho rahaa he
 Gheraupadhyay, accusing Kejriwal of another suicide tweet on the Sony suicide case, accused Kejriwal of having people around him who lived in color since the time of the NGO
 yahi nahinsoni aatmahatya kandako lekar kiye saharaavat ke twit par bhi bijepi ne kejariwal ko gheraa
 According to 'kejriwal stealing the public's eye', Upadhyay said that Sehrawat is an old ally of Kejriwal and knows many of his secrets
 isliye jab ye aarope anna andolan ke vakt se unke saathi rahe saharaavat laga rahe hai, to inaki gambhirtha samajhi ja sakati he
 BJP President Satish Upadhyay said that Kejriwal is running away from these questions and allegations, hence he is looking for excuses to stay away from Delhi
 ek ke baad ek unheen kii party ke log un par or unke sahyogiyon par aarope laga rahe hai, jinka jawaab kejariwal ke paas nahin he, isiilie wo dilli kii janata se aankh chura rahe he
 Not appreciating Colonel Sehrawat, Upadhyay did not forget to praise Colonel Sehrawat
 upaadhyaay ke mutabik devendra saharaavat badhai ke hakdaar hai ki unhone vidhayak rahete hue apni hi party ke mukhyamantri or party ke netaaon ke khilaaf aawaaj uthaane kii himmat kii he, jabaki aam aadmi party ke bheetar kisi ko bolne kii ijaajat bhi nahin he
 Individuals of Indian origin living in London have been sentenced to seven years in prison
 is vyakti par aarope he ki vah apni mahila mitra ke saath chalati car main sex kar rahaa tha
 Because of which a road accident occurred
 or uski dost is haadase kaa shikaar ho gai
 The British court on Monday sentenced 36-year-old Meenesh Parbat, of Indian origin, to the incident in March last year in West Sussex
 haadase ke vakt minesh tej raftaar se apni BMW car chalaa rahaa tha
 He was accompanied by his 28-year-old female friend Lisa Watling in the car
 donon sharaab ke nashe main the
 After the accident, people pulled Meenesh and his girlfriend Lisa Watling out of the crashed car
 us vakt minesh kaa trouzar or underware uske ghutanon tak tha
 While Lisa wore only a tshirt and bra
 lisa ko gambhir chotein ai thi
 Who died during treatment in the hospital
 somvaar ko dakshin-purv england main lives crown court ke jaj peter griffiths ne is maamle main sajaa sajaa sunaate hui kaha ki soobaton or gavaahon ke aadhaar par main is baat se puri tarah santusht hum ki yah haadasa main lija kii maut kii vajah minesh parbat kii laaparvaahee se hui
 He should not have done sex related work in the car at a speed of 70 mph
 is haadase ke liye minesh puri tarah doshi he
 During the trial, however, Meenesh denied sexual activity while driving in court
 usne kaha tha ki yah baat dekhne main sexual prathit hoti he, lekin aisa kuch nahin hua tha
 While he was trying to distance himself from Lisa just before the accident
 jaanch ke dauraan minesh ke khun main alcohol paaya gaya tha
 The police have arrested Meenesh following the court's decision
 udhar, lisa ke parivaar kaa kahana he ki is maamle ke asli peedit to lisa ke do bachche hai
 Now they have no one in this world
 mohabbat kii nishaani tajmahal pichley kuch dinon se siyasat kaa akhaada bana hua he
 On Monday, some Hindu Yuva Vahini activists held a Shiv Chalisa outside the Taj Mahal, after which the controversy was heated
 ab is maamle par bijepi netaa vinay katiyaar kaa bhi bayaan aayaa he
 Vinay Katiyar has said that it is not wrong to worship in the Taj Mahal, nobody has gone inside and worshiped outside
 vahaan koi hanuman chalisa padhe yaa shiv aarti karen, isamen koi dikkat nahin he
 Vinay Katiyar said that Kitajmahal was the palace and temple of the old kings, Shah Jahan made it a cemetery
 mumtaj to aurangabad main dafnai gai thi uske baad usko tajmahal ne dafnaaya gaya
 He said that the building is good, but it is not Taj Mahal, Tejo Temple
 is asaliyat ko samajhakar logon ko vyavhaar karnaa chahie
 There are many consequences of having a temple in the Taj Mahal where water is falling while water falls in the Shiva temple itself
 vahaan naag or datura kii akruti he, ashtakoniya gumbad hai, masjidon main aisa nahin hota
 Katiyar said that it is a matter of regret that Kishahahan gave a burial ground
 ye durbhaagya he ki banaaya kisi raja ne or naam shahjahan kaa ho rahaa he, yahi takalif he
 He said that this Taj Mahal is a world famous building from the point of view of tourism but it is not a cultural heritage and not a national heritage but now the government may have accepted a national heritage from the point of view of tourism but it cannot be a national heritage
 tajmahal ko aise hi rahane den, bharat ke kaarigaron ne bahut sundar banaaya he
 People will consider Taj Mahal but people like me will consider it as Shiv temple
 par ab to wo kabristaan ban gaya he or mandiron main kabristaan nahin ho saktaa
 It must be so that the details of the king who built the temple and the craftsmen who built the Taj Mahal should be written out
 gauratlab he ki mukhyamantri yogi adityanath 26 oktober ko agra ja rahe hai
 Here he will stay at the Taj Mahal for 30 minutes
 yogi yahaan svachh bharat abhiyaan ke tahat jhaadu bhi lagaayenge

 Ashwin, who played a key role in India's 2–1 win with 21 wickets in the three-match Test series in Sri Lanka, said the captain's confidence in his ability benefited him
 asvinane kaha, ‘main jo bhi karun usamen sarvshereshth hona chahta hum
 i have always repeated this
 agar main bas conductor yaa driver hum to main chahta hum ki mainduniya main sarvshereshtharahuun
 So this was greatly helped by the fact that me and he (virat's) work towards the same goal
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘vah jab bhi gend detaa he to main aashwast hota hum ki mujhe vah milegaa jo main chahta hum or hameshaa meraa samarthan kiya jayega or yah sirf mere or uske bich hi nahin he
 i think he has done this with every member of the team
 usne jiskaa bhi samarthan kiya, puraa samarthan kiya or baadha paar karne main uski madad kii
 The Indian youth team made a comeback after falling behind to win the series in Sri Lanka after 22 years and Ashwin is not happy with critics who are trying to snatch the credit by calling the Angelo Mathews-led team weak
 aswin ne kaha, ‘jab bhi aap shrey ke hakdaar ho to mujhe lagata he ki yah diya janaa chahie or jab aap aalochana ke hakdaar ho to aapako ise bhi sweekaar karnaa chahie
 He said, 'if you look at both the teams, it was quite similar
 donon tiimon ne samaan sankhya main cricket match khele hai
 So i don't see any reason why you want to take away the credit for a great effort to win the series after trailing 0-1

 Ashwin, however, defended his teammate and said that he would come back stronger
 unhone kaha, ‘mujhe lagata he ki sabhi ko vahi bane rahete kii jarurat he jo vah he
 Whoever is playing cricket wants to be aggressive
 kuch log andar se hi aakraamak hote hai, kuch log khud ko adhik jaahir kar pate hai
 But whatever happens in life, there is a need to learn a lesson and Ishant is aggressive, he won the Test for us
 ’aswin ne kaha, ‘usase shrey nahin chhina ja saktaa
 He may have crossed the border, but that does not mean that we follow him
 mujhe lagata he ki vah is anubhav se sikhega or mujhe vishwaas he ki vah aakraamakata ke saath vaapasi karegaa
 With controlled aggression and will win far more matches for us

 - Gunjan Batra (@gunjanbatra) October 19, 2015 desh main i-cigarette par pabandi lagane kaa centre sarkaar kaa faisla thik he lekin baaki cigarette or bidi jaise utpaadon ko chhod dena tarksangat prathit nahin hota he
 The packets of cigarettes and tobacco products have started to appear with great difficulty with a big picture warning them of cancer
 sabhi tarah ke tambaakoo utpaada nuksaandeh hai is tathy ko jaanate hue bhi sirf i-cigarette par pabandi lagane kaa faisla adhuraa lagata he
 The ban on e-cigarettes has come in such a strong way that its production, import, export, transport, sale, distribution and advertisement has been made a cognizable offense through the ordinance and a fine of Rs 1 lakh and one year jail for the first offense
 , a penalty of 5 lakh and three years imprisonment has been provided for the subsequent offenses
 sarkaar kaa ye kaam to saraahneey he lekin baaki tambaakoo utpaadon ko chhod dena bataata he ki sarkaar kisi khaas makasad se aisa kar rahi he
 Perhaps he gets very modest revenue from e-cigarettes
 cigarette par sarkaar tex to baari-bharkam lagaati he lekin sach ye he ki ek chauthai cigarette bina tex chukaaye bik rahi he
 There is a very marginal tax on beedis in the country and it remains the cheapest tobacco product
 i-cigarette se mauton kii pukhta jaankaree nahin mili lekin anya tambaakoo utpaadon ke istemaal se hone vaali mauton kii jaankaree bahut pehle hi saamne aa chuki he
 According to the World Health Organization, 1 million people in the country die each year from tobacco use
 ye sankhya desh main salanaa marane vaale logan kaa 9
 5 percent
 2018 main desh main tambaakoo kaa seven karne waalon kii sankhya 26 karod se zyada kii he
 More than 42 percent of the country's population earns, that is, they are between 30 and 69 years old
 bharat ke swasthya mantralay kii ek report iconomic bardan of tobaco related dijis in india ke mutabik, 2011 main 35 se 69 saal ke logon main tambaakoo se hone vaali bimariyon ke falswaroop 1,40, 500 karod rupye kii aarthik chapat lagi
 Males accounted for 91 percent of it
 jaahir he, desh main tambaakoo se janmaal kaa bahut bada nuksaan hota he or sarkaar ko is par roak lagane par gambhirtha se sochna chahie, rajasav kii chintaa kiye bagaiyr
 Apart from the central government, the state governments can also ban tobacco and gutkha in their area, but this work has been done so cleverly that the ban is not detected
 desh ke kareeb do darjan rajya gutkhe par pabandi laga chuke hai lekin ye tambakooyukt gutkhe par lagi he or alag se tambaakoo bik rahi he
 No state has imposed a ban on cigarettes as it is also a matter of revenue
 haa, i-cigarette par centre sarkaar ke adhyadesh se pehle hi 16 rajya pabandi laga chuke hai
 The Health Department spends on non-tobacco use campaigns while the Finance Ministry imposes taxes on them in the budget
 cigarette-bidi par pabandi lagane kii baat koi nahin karata
 Cigarettes do not contribute much to the total tobacco consumption of the country
 89 fisadi khapat bidi, kheni or avaidh cigarette kii hoti he
 Tobacco is the main cause of cancer and lung disease
 sarkaar kaa kaam logon kaa kalyaan karnaa he na ki privet company kii tarah munafa kamanaa
 Governments will have to implement tambakubandi like liquor ban, otherwise its steps will be viewed with suspicion

 ) Recently, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj was heavily trolled on social media in the passport case of anas-tanvi in lucknow
 baad main sushamaa swaraj ne unke twits ko like kiya tha
 Communist Party of India (CPI) leader Atul Anjan has reacted to this
 atul anjaan ne kaha ki, 'ye trols zyaadaatar bijepi or RSS ke samarthak hai or unase jude hue log hai
 Sushma ji should have understood that she herself has taken such trolls
 in tamaam trols ko bahut saare kendriya mantri or khud pradhanmantri follow karte hai or kai dafe man kii baat main inkaa zikr kar bhi chuke hai
 Atul Anjan said that, Sushma Swaraj is unwell, she is unable to handle the foreign minister's charge, the Prime Minister should understand this
 'isi vajah se bharat kii videsh niti kaa kabada ho gaya he
 The foreign minister will have to take credit for the failure of foreign policy
 'aage unhone chutki lete hue kaha, 'jin logon ne andey khaae hai unhen danda to khaane padenge
 This is what the Prime Minister needs to see
 yah sarkaar kii vifaltaaon kaa ek hissaa he
 The morale of such people has increased due to the encouragement of BJP and RSS
 itnaa sab hone ke baavjood bhi agar pradhanmantri un trols ko follow kar rahe hai or maamle par chup hai to zaahiran yah sushamaa ji ke liye ek sandesh he
 Ethics does not matter to BJP
 ' Four children were killed in an illegal camp fire on the outskirts of the Italian capital
 adhikariyon ne bataaya ki in bacchon kii umr teen se 11 saal ke bich thi
 According to the Ansa news agency, the incident happened around 8:30 pm local time
 aag ke kaarnon kii jaanch kii ja rahi he
 Thousands of Romans live in illegal constructions in and out of the capital
 adhikariyon ne pichley saal kaha tha ki avaidh rihaayshi shiviron ko band kar diya jayega
 Death penalty in India means capital punishment
 ujaalaa hone se pehle doshi kaa sir faansee ke fande main daal diya jaataa he
 a person in black clothes suffocates
 yaa yon kahen kii faansee kaa fanda uskaa galaa ghont detaa he
 This way of punishing a death seems extremely cruel
 marane vaale kii maut ek pal main nahin kuch palon tak chatapataane ke baad hoti he
 That is why a PIL was filed in the Supreme Court
 isamen kaha gaya ki 'garimapurna mrityu ke adhikaar' ko moulik adhikaar main shaamil kiya jaae
 According to the petitioner advocate Rishi Malhotra, hanging is a 'painful and painful long way'
 isliye kam takalifdeh or thode samay main maut kii sajaa dene ke tareeke apanaaen jaaen
 The central government defended the hanging option, saying in the Supreme Court on Tuesday
 kisi kaidi ko maut kii sajaa ke liye jaharila injection dena yaa phir use goli maarane ke mukaable faansee dena kam amanviya or barbar tarika he
 After all, why did the center give an example of giving poisonous injections or shot dead
 darasal duniya main kai aise desh hai jahaan maut kii sajaa in tareekon se di jaati he
 Apart from this, there are many other methods which are used all over the world
 duusari taraf 97 desh maut kii sajaa khatm kar chuke hai
 In the affidavit submitted in response to the petition, the Center has argued that the death penalty is given in the US by injecting poisonous injections, but this method seems peaceful and painless only to see
 centre ne saath hi yah ashanka bhi jataai ki injection main jin rasayanon kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he, unki jaankaree agar saarvajanik ho gai to iskaa beja istemaal bhi ho saktaa he
 On the option of shooting for the death penalty, the Center has argued that it would be difficult to select policemen for this action on a voluntary basis
 maut krur banane vaali sajaaengoli markar puri karte hai maut kii sajaaduniya ke kul 73 deshon main aparaadhiyon ko goli markar maut di jaati he
 30 of these countries also adopt other methods of giving death
 lekin inamen se 43 desh sirf goli markar hi maut dete hai
 These countries include Indonesia, China, North Korea, Taiwan, Yemen, US, Chile, Ghana, Bangladesh, Cameroon, Syria, Uganda, Kuwait, Iran, Egypt
 barasaai jaatin hai tabadatod goliyanis tareeke main sajaa paane vaale kii ankhon par kaali pattee baandhi jaati he or use firing squad main khadaa kiya jaataa he yaa baitha diya jaataa he
 The firing squad usually consists of army personnel and officers responsible for law and order
