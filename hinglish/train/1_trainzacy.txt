 The attitude of the BJP, which is speeding up the exercise of forming a government in Delhi, now seems to have changed
 dilli bijepi ke adhyaksh satish upaadhyaay ne shuukravaar raat kaha ki party nae sire se chunaav ke liye puri tarah taiyaar he
 Satish Upadhyay said, 'the party is fully prepared for fresh elections
 agar chunaav hue, to hamen dilli main shashan karne ke liye spasht bahumat milane kaa puraa bharosa he
 He said that BJP does not yet have the number to form a government, but if Lt
 Governor Najeeb Jung invites him to form the government, the party will find an alternative
 bijepi ke netritv vaali kendra sarkaar kii ore se shuukravaar ko hi dilli kaa bajet pesh kiya gaya he
 Maximum 1 on electricity
 20 rupee prati unit sabsidi die jane kii ghoshnaa ke baad satish upaadhyaay kaa yah bayaan aayaa he
 This decision of the Center will benefit 80 percent or 28 lakh electricity consumers of Delhi
 dilli ke logon ko rijhaane vaala siyaasi daanv chalakar bijepi kii baanchhein khili hui hai
 The party is running both Chit and Pat
 madhya pradesh ke 18wein mukhyamantri kaa pad sambhalate hikmalnathane karjamaafee, rojgaar, udyog se jude ek ke baad ek faisle lekar sabko chaunkaa diya
 How truly this positive initiative of Kamal Nath lands on the ground will now be worth seeing
 kyonki shivaraj sarkaar ne kai aisi yojanaayen shuru kii thim jinke kaaran madhya pradesh sarkaar par aarthik sankat aa saktaa he
 If seen, the central government may incur an additional burden of 34 to 38 thousand crore rupees from debt waiver
 aise main shivaraj sarkaar ne shuru kii bhavantar or sambal yojanaon kaa akalan bhi congress sarkaar ko karnaa hoga
 If these schemes continue after the debt waiver, then the government can get into deep economic crisis and if these schemes are discontinued, then the farmers will also have to explain the reason for the closure
 iske liye congress ko kushal raajnneetik prabandhan kii jarurat padegi
 Now if we talk about electricity, the Congress has also talked about halving the electricity bill in the promissory note to give relief to the farmers
 haalanki, sarkaar philhal ise lagu karegi isamen andeh he
 At the same time, the Congress has promised to give 100 units of electricity for hundred rupees under the Indiragriha Jyoti Yojana
 raajnneetik jaankaron kaa kahana he ki karjamaafee or lok-lubhaavan ghoshnaaon se rajya par karj badhegaa
 According to the rules of the Reserve Bank, the government will take the loan, but it will have to find a permanent solution to improve the situation
 saath hi sanvidakarmiyon or dainik vetanbhogiyon ko niyamit karne kaa vaada bhi kaaphi mushkil he
 Staff will pressurize that this promise be fulfilled even before the Lok Sabha elections
 yadi yah vaada puraa karne main congress kaamyaab hogi to nattejey badal sakate hai
 In view of the demand of milk producers to increase the purchase price, the Tamil Nadu government has announced an increase in the price of milk by Rs 10 per liter
 rajya sarkaar ne teen varsh pehle doodh kii keemat badhaai thi
 Chief Minister o Panneerselvam said in a statement, there should be no impediment in the payment made to the milk producers nor there should be any compromise with the quality of the milk supplied to the consumers
 sarkaar teen saal ke baad is vruddhi kii ghoshnaa karne ke liye baadhya he
 He said that the government is obliged to increase the price of one liter toned milk from Rs 24 to Rs 34 per liter
 rajya ke kareeb 22
 In view of the demand of 5 lakh milk producers, the government has also increased the purchase price of cow and buffalo milk by five rupees and four rupees per liter respectively
 doodh utpaadakon kii maang thi ki chaare ke daam, maweshiyon kii keemat or anya laagton ke maddenjar doodh kharid mulya badhaayaa jaae
 "keep the economy
 inkaar na karo
 It is economical to see, but it really costs more than that
 bas, rakh lo ise
 i have this economy by taking it, even if it cannot pay your wages
 
 
 !"yah kehete hue maine raamu mochi kii hatheli par iknni rakh di
 It took me half an hour to repair my boot
 mazdooree kii baat usne mere insaaf par chhod di thi
 Putting the economy in his pocket, he looked at me with torn eyes and then maybe started rubbing it in his pocket
 use kya maaloom tha ki is iknni ke saath meri ek kahani judi hui he- mujhe dilli se kundeshwar janaa tha
 There was a train journey to Lalitpur
 aage lari jaati thi
 Many a day passed in the same dilemma that today we get money and tomorrow
 dilli main patrakaron kaa sammelan ho rahaa tha
 a friend of mine who used to work in 'madhukar' to be published from Kundeshwar came to Delhi in this regard
 usne mujhe apane saath chalane ke liye bahut majaboor kiya
 i postponed work and postponed it
 vah maan gaya
 But the hands kept telling me that there is a ticket of five rupees till Lalitpur and fifteen are enough for the motor to come forward
 ek saptaah biit gaya
 i could not prepare for Kundeshwar
 sasura rupaya bhi kabhi-kabhi bahut tarasaata he or chaahe meri yatra kii gaathaayen rupye kii tangi se bhari padi hai, dilli kii vah tangi mujhe sadaa yaad rahegi
 The day i reached Delhi, i had a lot of money to come
 ve choti-choti jaruraton par kharch ho gaye
 Where the money was to be found, could not be found
 par maine apane chehre par ghabrahat ke chihn na paidaa hone die
 From New Delhi, where i was staying with a friend, i would often reach the city on foot and then return to my residence on foot
 har roj mujhe lautne main der ho jaati
 My friend would laugh and ask the reason for this
 main hanskar baat ai-gai kar detaa
 How would i say that my pocket is empty! i have occasional concerns about empty pockets
 ab yah iknni is mochi ko dekar meri jeb khaali ho gai he
 So what happened! I'm happy
 ek din raat ko dilli main meri ek mitra ke yahan daavat thi
 From there, it was ten o'clock by the time of passing
 ab waapas nai dilli lautnaa tha
 i walked on foot
 hausala haarana maine siikhaa hi nahin
 a tanga passed by nearby
 maine aawaaj di, "tonga!"tonga ruk gaya
 a ride was already seated
 taange vaala bolaa, "kidar jaaoge?""jidhar bhi le chalo
 ""plenty! Take it wherever
 
 
 kidar le chaluun?
 
 
 i am going to Twelve in New Delhi
 ""mujhe bhi vahiin le chalo
 "" It will cost three
 raat bahut ho chali he
 The second one kept getting tanga
 ""par bhai, mere paas to paise hai hi nahin
 "there is no money!" Aji, don't joke like that
 yah thik nahin
 "" I'm not joking
 mere paas sachmuch paise nahin hai
 "there was a good man with a tooth
 use dayaa aa gai
 He said, "okay then sit down
 tumhaare teen aane paise khuda se maang loonga
 "very well!" Tanga was going away and i was thinking that when God did not let me have three, then how would he allow this copper person to have three in my reckoning? There were many thoughts in my heart- Kept going khuda kya bhalaa he? kuch log kehete hai ki khuda kaa khyal keval ek vaham he
 
 
 
 kya yah sachmuch ek vaham he? kya main ishwar main utana hi yakeen rakhata hoon jitna yah taange vaala? yadi nahin, to maine kaise maan liya ki vah mere hisaab se khuda se teen aane vasuul kar sakegaa?
 
 
 i also remembered the incident when i told one of my literary friends in response to the question that even if God is not there, then we should imagine a God just for our refuge
 phir maine sochaa ki is taange vaale ne mujhe jarur koi sadhu samaj liya he
 Seeing the long hair and beard of the head, people often get cheated
 or yadi use maaloom ho jaae ki sachmuch ke khuda par vishwaas karne kii bajaay main keval ek kaalpanik khuda ko maanata hoon to jhat vah mujhe apane taange se utaar baahar kare
 The fellow traveler said, "what do you do?" i replied, "I gather folk songs
 ""kisi company kii taraf se?""nahin sahab, yah meraa apana shauk he
 "" What is your hobby? 
 
 khub!
 
 
 But sir, this is the world
 rupye kamaane hi ke to sab dhandhe hai
 "" But sir, i am not just doing this job to earn money
 ""ghar se amir honge?""ghar se main rupye nahin letaa
 "" So how do you manage the expenses of bread and travel? "" i earn a little money by writing articles in newspapers and magazines, and i tell the truth that even if i stop getting these money, i will not leave this job
 ""aap jarur koi sadhu honge?""nahin ji, main to ek gruhasthi hoon
 My wife and daughter, who often accompany me on the journey, have gone to the village nowadays
 ""thik
 "" Well or not, say anything
 is samay to main muft main taange kii sawari kar rahaa hoon
 The truth is that i am also a laborer like this copper
 fark itnaa he ki vah nakad mazdooree paata he, par is garib lekhak ko patr-patrikaon vaale taalte chale jate hai
 
 
 
 nahin to aaj yah naubat na aati ki muft main taange kii sawari maangoon
 And it is a matter of thanks to this man that he has also acquitted me of the burden of gratitude by asking me to take three accounts from God
 "sadak par bijli kii roshni thi or iske mukaable main garib taange vaale ke lamp kii batti bahut dhimi jal rahi thi
 The copper person was listening to us with great pleasure
 use khush karne ke liye maine kaha, "sahab, main to samajhataa hoon ki taange waalon kii kamai khun-paseene kii kamai he
 If i ever get a man born again in this world, i would like to be born in the home of a strongman
 "taange vaala bolaa, "yah na kaho ji
 We lie a hundred a day and i want you to get relief
 paidaa hona or mar janaa!
 
 
 This is a very tough test, sir
 "dilli main ve do saptaah maine badi bhagdaud main gujaarey
 There was no problem of eating and drinking
 par din main kai-kai mile paidal chalanaa, vah bhi chamade kaa baari thilaa uthaae hue, yah kuch aasaan kaam na tha
 It was necessary to meet friends and reach place to place in search of songs
 kundeshwar se patr aayaa, likhaa tha- fouran chale aao
 This was Choubeji's letter
 ab vahaan janaa or bhi jaruri ho gaya
 i borrowed seven rupees from my friend
 paanch rupye pandrah aane kiraye ke liye, ek rupaya or ek iknni upar ke kharch ke liye
 Eight people had to give the cash to the station
 baaki bache saadhe chah rupye
 When it reached the window of the ticket house, it was found that it would not be worth five rupees to Lalitpur, but five rupees eleven tickets would be charged
 yah bhi khub rahi
 So did that friend of Kundeshwar joke? i fret over my weak memory
 or koi chaara bhi to na tha
 we will see whatever happens
 maine lalitpur kaa tikat liya or kuli se asabaav uthavakar gaadi main ja baitha
 Gave an economy porter
 ab jo baaki paise gine to kul saadhe das aane bache
 Now i remembered that one and a half days had been spent on the leg
 saadhe das aane
 
 
 Ten and a half total! There were many ups and downs in the heart
 phir kisi tarah dil ko dilasa diya
 If i reach Lalitpur, it will be seen again
 raat bhar railgadee kaa safar rahaa
 Did not sleep agle savere lalitpur aa gaya
 Porter brought out the goods
 pataa chalaa ki lari ke adde tak taange vaale ko ek duanni deni hogi
 There were a total of ten and a half in my pocket
 badi mushkil se kuli ko do paise main bhugtaya or taange vaala ek aane main maan gaya
 Tanga was going
 saath kii seat vaale yuvak se maine puch liya, "kyon bhai! kundeshwar kaa yahan se kya lagegaa?"yah prashn maine kuch is lahaze main kiya tha ki use yah mahasoos ho ki main is silsile main bilkul aparichit hoon
 He said, "only fifteen
" ""pandrah aane!
 
 
 But brother, there are only ten left in my pocket, consider one of them as a cashier
 or mere paas rah gaye sirf nau aane
 "" Nine to come! "" So where will you get the remaining six from? "" That is the concern, if there is any solution, tell me
 ""ab yah main kya jaanun bhai? main to abhi vidhyaarthee hoon
 Know the truth, i would have taken a ticket if i had it
 
 
 
 And the difficulty is that i come to read from outside
 koi mujhe udhaar degaa nahin
 "I got quiet and believe it, it was only after i got here that i became completely silent and could have an impact on that student
 vah bhi chand minute tak khamosh baitha rahaa
 The tonga was going and i said to the tonga, "hey brother, if you don't take your economy from me, then my difficulty is reduced to five instead of six
 "vah bolaa, "sahab, main apni iknni jarur loonga
 In this way, if i start leaving the units, my horse will die of hunger and on the way home i should eat my wife's abuses separately
 "use yah andeh hua ki main adde par pahunchakar iknni dene se inkaar na kar baithun
 He stopped the tanga
 bolaa, "adda dur nahin he
 Take out an economy "maine iknni uski hatheli par rakhi, tab vah aage chalaa
 The student started asking, "what do you do?" "I collect folk songs of every language
 ""ji haan, ‘vishwamitra’ main maine geeton par ek lekh padhaa tha
 Will belong to you "maine haan main sir hilaa diya
 Seeing the work done, i did not think it necessary to spoil it
 nahin to koi or avasar hota to main poochta ki kis maheene ke ‘vishwamitra’ kii baat he or lekh kaa sheershak kya tha?vah bolaa, "aapkaa naam?"maine apana naam bataaya or vah bolaa, "vah lekh maine bade dhyaan se padhaa tha
 Surely it will be written by you
 yah to bada mahaan kaary he ji
 "this praise made me even more ashamed
 yah bahut mahaan kaary he ji!
 
 
 If this work is so great then why is my financial condition so bad? 
 
 lari kaa tikat lagegaa pandrah aane or mere paas hai sirf nau aane
 He said, "now you don't worry
 main aapkaa prabandh apane jimme letaa hoon
 Don't tell anyone that you have less money
 aap lari par savaar ho jaaie
 Lari will run after two hours
 itane main main dekh loonga
 "upon reaching the base, he made me sit in a lorry comfortably
 vah swayan tikat conductor se jaakar mila
 Who knows what true and false things he may have said
 main to itnaa hi jaanata hoon ki vah use liye hue aayaa or bolaa, "ve nau aane inhen de dijie
 They give you tickets to Kundeshwar
 "maine batua kholaa
 i watched the coming of nine very carefully
 par baahar sirf aath aane nikaale
 Giving them to him, he said, "if you give orders, i keep an economy
 kundeshwar main jarurat padegi
 i will give it to a porter carrying Asabav from the road to Choubeji's house
 vahaan pahonchte hi yah to jaahir karne se rahaa ki meri jeb main ek iknni bhi nahin he
 "yes, yes, keep the economy with you
" "***vahaan kundeshwar main pahunchaa to sadak par choubeji kaa ek mitra maujuud tha
 He arranged for my furnishings
 vah iknni mere paas bachi rahi
 i took it and kept it in my pocket
 jab kabhi choubeji ko gilori kii aavashyaktaa padati, main jhat jeb se iknni nikaalata or kahata, "paise main de doongaa
 "choubeeji would return it by saying no
 or jab maine raamu se boot kii marammat karaane ke baad yah kaha, "ise rakh lo, inkaar na karo
 It is economical to see, but it really costs more than that
 
 
 !" meri ankhen geeli ho gai thim
 
 
 He had received nothing but this economy throughout the day
 usne sochaa hoga ki usne ek antaryami sadhu kaa boot marammat kiya he, nahin to vah kaise jaanata he ki ghar main uski bhukhi bivi or bachche isi iknni kii baat joh rahe hai

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi can continue riding on the storm of demonetisation, because apart from being divided, his opposition at the national level lacks credibility and the extraordinary patience to face inconveniences among the common people
 is bich gujarat, maharashtra, rajasthan or chandigarh ke nigam chunaavon main bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) ko mili jeet se jaahir hota he ki ab tak pradhanmantri main logon kaa vishwaas bana hua he
 It is also true that Trinamool Congress, a bitter critic of Modi, has also won several elections in its political circles
 isse jaahir hota he ki raajnneetik dalon ke prabhaav kshetra majbootee se simaankit hai, lekin nihsandeh modi ke prabhaav ek bade kshetra main faile hue hai
 But Modi's fire test will actually be held in Uttar Pradesh next year, which is more important than the simultaneous assembly elections in Punjab, Goa, Manipur and Uttarakhand
 uttar pradesh vidhansabha chunaav ke parinaam darshaaenge ki bhaajapa ke vikaas purush kis tarah apane kaarykaal kaa aadha safar puraa kar rahe hai
 The exam is even more important because demonetisation is part of the economic reform that Modi wants to implement
 lekin jahaan tak rojgaar srijan kaa sawaal he to 'sabakaa saath or sabakaa vikaas' kaarykram ab tak khaas safal nahin rahaa he
 Perhaps that's why Modi's central government is working on a new policy to curb the parallel economy and introduce a cashless system in the country so that the next general election will help cross the windstorm

 After eating out in the Hindi-speaking state of Bihar, Modi would not like Uttar Pradesh to get out of the BJP

 kuch samay pehle sapa main mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav or unke chachaa shivpal yadav ke bich paariwarik jhagade se prathit hua ki bhaajapa ko badhat milegi, lekin paariwarik kalah kuch samay ke liye tham chukaa he, kyonki mulaayam singh yadav ne shaayad yah mahasoos kar liya he ki aantarik jhagade se party apni kabr khod rahi he
 Like the young political leaders of today, Akhilesh Yadav, a proponent of development, has vigorously launched several development-oriented schemes to compensate for the waste of time while engaging in a dispute with the elders
 isliye modi is hakeekat se waakif honge ki sapa se or adhik laabh milanaa aasaan nahin he, jaisaa ki unhone uske aantarik kalah ke samay sochaa tha
 Nevertheless, if there is an alliance between the SP and the Congress, the challenge will become even more formidable for the BJP, as the muslim-yadav alliance will be formed again for which Bihar was once known

 ' pakistan kii jameen se waapas laute desh ke nayak wing commander abhinandan ne deabriffing ke dauraan bataaya he ki mig-21 se pakistani vimaanon kaa peechha karte hue unhone R73 missile se pakistan ke ek F-16 vimaan ko maar giraaya tha or use pakistan kii seemaa main girte bhi dekha tha
 Air Force sources have confirmed this
 haalanki is maamle main bada sawaal yah he ki abhinandan kii suraksha main peeche lage do vimaanon ne pakistani epa-16 vimaan par koi karrwai kyon nahin kii?iconomic times ke anusaar, anusaar wing commander abhinandan kii suraksha main ek sukhoi30 emkeai or miraj 2000 bhi peeche the, lekin yah spasht nahin he ki unhone aakhir kyon dushman ke vimaan par hamalaa nahin kiya? jabaki unke paas long range ke missile bhi the
 The Air Force has not cleared anything yet
 vaise saamaanya paristhiti main kisi ladaaku vimaan ke payalat se yah ummid nahin kii jaati ki vah dushman ke ilaake main jaakar uske vimaanon ko nishaanaa banaae
 Significantly, there was a kind of skirmish in the skies between the Air Force of India and Pakistan in Nowshera sector of Kashmir last week
 kuch pakistani vimaan bhartiya seemaa main ghus aae the, jinhen bhartiya vaayu sena ke jaanbaaj javaanon ne khaded diya tha
 Wing Commander Abhinandan went inside the Pakistan border, chasing down a Pakistani F-16 aircraft
 unke mig-21 vimaan par bhi waar kiya gaya jiske baad ve jameen par parachute kii sahaayta se utre the or unhen pakistan kii sena dwaara hiraasat main le liya gaya tha
 But within three days after international pressure, Pakistan had to release Abhinandan
 abhinandan ke shaury ko deshbhar main saraahna mili thi
 He was welcomed with great enthusiasm during his return to the country
 bharat aae abhinandan se vayusena ke adhikari debifring kar jaankaree le rahe hai ki puraa vakya kaise hua or pakistan main unke saath kis tarah kaa vyavhaar kiya gaya
 According to the newspaper, during his debriefing, Abhinandan shared the full details of how the planes of India and Pakistan fought fiercely in the sky
 abhinandan ke vimaan par sambhavat: unke mig-21 vimaan par pakistani vimaan se long range AMRAAM missile se hamalaa kiya tha, jiske baad abhinandan ko iject suvidha kaa istemaal karte hue neeche utarana padaa
 The newspaper quoted sources as saying, 'abhinandan told in a detailed debriefing that he had collided with a jet plane from Pakistan
 unhone isaki soochna ground controlar ko di or khud dushman desh ke vimaan par R73 missile se hamalaa kiya
 The Indian Air Force had said in an official statement that its aircraft were attacked with several AIM120 AMRAAM missiles from Pakistani F-16 aircraft
 sutron ke anusaar pakistan ke vimaan ne kam se kam chaar mixilon se mig-21 par hamalaa kiya tha, lekin wing commander behad chaalaaki se kalabaji karte hue kuch samay tak apane ko bachaa le gaye or unhone dushman ke ek epa-16 vimaan ko maar bhi giraaya
 However, later when the missile hit the mig-21 aircraft, they had to eject and get down
 uttar pradesh main yogi adityanath ke netritv vaali bijepi sarkaar ne 15 june tak pradesh kii sadakon ko gaddha mukt karne kaa vaada kiya tha
 The Yogi government now claims that 45,054 km of roads have been made pit-free
 mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ke mutabik sambandhit adhikariyon ko ye sunishchit karne ke liye kaha gaya he ki pradesh kii sadaken 15 june tak puri tarah gaddha mukt ho jaaen
 Aaj Tak recently conducted a reality check on the condition of roads in Uttar Pradesh
 isse pataa chalaa ki ab bhi pradesh ke kai ilaakon main sadaken khastahal hai or gaddhon kii bharmaar he
 Now it will have to be seen whether the roads in UP will be free of pit in the deadline scheduled for June 15
 ye jarur he ki 15 june kii samaysima sir par aane kii vajah se lakshya ko puraa karne ke liye adhikari haath-pair maar rahe hai
 For the reality check, the Aaj Tak team reviewed the roads in Lakhimpur Kheri, Barabanki, Chandauli and Allahabad
 lakhimpur khirirashtriya rajmarg 724 dilli ko pilibhit, lakhimpur, bahraaich, ayodhya, basti ke raste assam tak jaataa he
 Visiting the Dhaurahra tehsil area of lakhimpur-kheri district can be clearly seen that the roads are in ruins
 yahaan gadde itane khatarnaak hai ki aae din haadason ko nyotaa dete rahete hai
 The 'aaj Tak' team saw the plight of a truck stuck in a big pit
 trek kaa driver is musiibat se baahar nikalne ke liye duusare trek or rasse kii madad letaa dikhaa
 The driver of the truck said that there are so many pits here that even driving becomes a problem
 kachua chaal se hi trek ko aage badhanaa padataa he
 The driver of the roadways bus leading to Nepal also says that due to these broken roads, the passengers of Nepal get a chance to sarcasm
 sadak kaa istemaal karne vaale sthaneey nagarikon kaa bhi kahana he ki yahaan itane gadde hai ki inaki vajah se vaahan aae din kharaab hote rahete hai
 According to the residents of Barabanki, Barabanki, by June 15, the 'pit-free' of roads seems far-fetched
 barabanki kii kai ahm sadakon par ab bhi gaddhon kii bharmaar he
 The road connecting the National Highway 28 to the bus station, Kachari and railway station has been in bad shape for the past one year
 is maarg par bike, car, rickshaw aadi sabhi tarah ke vaahan chaalkon ko dikkaton kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 Despite the people's performance, the condition of this road did not improve
 nagar panchayat banki kii sadakon kaa haal jaanane ke liye 'aaj tak' team pahuchi to vahaan bhi sadak par gadde hi gadde dikhe
 Nagar Panchayat Banki is responsible for repairing these roads
 lekin chairman anshu singh ko ye nahin pataa ki kab tender hua he or kab kaam shuru hokar khatm hoga
 When he was asked, he said that if the tender is made, the work of freeing the pit will start from the 10th and efforts will be made to finish it by the 15th
 vahiin nagar panchayat ke adhishasi adhikari premnath ne daawa kiya ki ek-do din main in sadakon ko gadda mukt karne kaa kaam shuru ho jaayegaa
 Chandauli to know the ground reality of the promise to make the roads free of potholes by June 15, the 'aaj Tak' team turned to Chandauli, then the condition of the roads there was also in disastrous conditions
 kendriya grih mantri rajnath singh ke grih janapad chandauli ke mughalsarai ilaake main dulhipur se sahupuri, vyasanagar hote hue ramnagar jane vaali 12 kilometre sadak kaa jayja liya gaya to vahaan gadde hi gadde dikhaai die
 When the villagers living nearby were asked, their reply was that no one had improved this road for the last two decades
 sthaneey naagarik ramnath prasad ke mutabik sadak kii haalat itani kharaab he ki rahgeer sanbhal kar naa chalem to gir kar ghayal ho jate hai
 Ramnath said that even big officials go through this road but its condition did not improve
 elahabadilahabaad or kaushambi main bhi sadakon kii jis tarah kii haalat he, use dekhte hue 15 june tak unke gaddha mukt hone kii sambhaavna kam hi najar aati he
 Kaushambi's Manauri road has been converted into huge pits
 yahaan hameshaa pani bharaa rahata he
 It is difficult for people to leave
 sthaneey nagarikon kaa kahana he ki kisi jaadu kii chadi ke ghumaane se hi yahaan kii sadakon kii haalat 15 june tak durust ho sakati he, varanaa isaki sambhaavna kam hi najar aati he

 inputah bhashaa se Team India's selectors are known for surprising decisions
 bharat or england ke bich mohali main 26 november se hone vaale tisare test ke liye chotil wicketiper riddhimaan saaha ke sthaan par gujarat ke parthiv patel kaa chayan aisa hi faisla mana ja rahaa he
 Parthiv's selection has come as a surprise as he has been included in Team India's Test team, sidelining the claims of Naman Ojha, Dinesh Karthik and Delhi's promising Rishabh Pant
 maje kii baat yah he ki 31 saal ke parthiv ne apana aakhri test agast 2008 main srilanka ke khilaaf colombo main khelaa tha
 He played his last international match in Brisbane against Sri Lanka in February 2012, more than four years ago as an ODI
 vaise bhi maujuuda ranjai sijan main parthiv kaa pradarshan koi 'asaadhaaran' nahin rahaa he
 In this season, where 19-year-old Rishabh Pant of Delhi has scored more than 800 runs in 6 matches with a triple century with a batting average of above 100, Parthiv's account has an average of around 60 in five matches from 400
 Only more runs are recorded
 pant is samay 2016-17 ranjai sijan ke na sirf top scorer hai balki jharkhand ke khilaaf ranjai trophy match main keval 48 gendon par shatak thokkar ve bharat kii taraf se pratham shrenee maichon main sabase tej banane vaale ballebaaj bhi bane hai
 Rishabh has impressed everyone in the Under-19 World Cup with his wicketkeeping and batting
 test team main jagah paane ke ek or daavedaar tamilnadu ke dinesh karthik ne bhi ranjai or dilip trophy main is sijan main parthiv se adhik ran score kiye hai
 Karthik has scored 574 runs in 9 innings of Ranji this season while his run number in the Duleep Trophy is 211 runs in five innings
 parthiv ne dilip trophy main chaar pariyon main 109 ran banaae hai
 Karthik, 31, is considered a better wicketkeeper than Parthiv
 parthiv kii tulana main unhone test, vanade or tii20 adhik khele hai
 Dinesh has represented Team India in 23 Tests, 71 odis and 9 T20s
 test maichon main ek shatak bhi dinesh karthik ke naam par darj he
 The comments sambhav he ki rishabh kii kam umr or unki ballebaaji style ko vanade ke mafik maanate hue unhen test team main mauka nahin diya gaya ho, lekin do anya wicketiper ballebaaj naman ojha or dinesh karthik ke daawey ko bhi chayankartaaon ne kyon nazarandaaj kar diya, yah samaj se pare he
 Naman Ojha, who was a part of Team India, played a test against Sri Lanka in 2015 in the absence of Wriddhiman Saha, in which he scored 56 runs at an average of 28
 33 varshiya naman ne isse pehle australia main bharat 'e' team kaa pratinidhitiv karte hue lagaataar teen shatak jamaakar har kisi ko prabhavit kiya tha
 It is obvious that Parthiv, who is better than Pant, Karthik and Naman, will now have to shut up critics by doing better in Mohali
 
 
 parthiv ke chayan par hairaani isliye jataai ja rahi he kyonki naman ojha, dinesh karthik or dilli ke honhaar rishabh pant ke daawey ko darkinar karte hue unhen team india kii test team main jagah di gai he
 Interestingly, 31-year-old Parthiv played his last test against Sri Lanka in Colombo in August 2008
 apana aakhri international match hi unhone, vanade ke rup main chaar saal se adhik samay pehle, farvari 2012 main srilanka ke khilaaf brisben main khelaa tha
 Anyway, Parthiv's performance in the current Ranji season has been no 'extravagant'
 is sijan main jahaan dilli ke 19 saal ke rishabh pant ne 6 maichon main 100 se upar ke ballebaaji ausat se ek tihare shatak sahit 800 se zyada ran bana daale hai, vahiin parthiv ke khate main paanch maichon main 60 ke aasapaas ke ausat se 400 se adhik ran hi darj hai
 Pant is not only the top scorer of the 2016-17 Ranji season at the moment but he has also become the fastest batsman in first-class matches for India by hitting a century in 48 Ranji Trophy matches against Jharkhand
 rishabh under-19 worldcup main bhi apni wicketcaping or ballebaaji se har kisi ko prabhavit kar chuke hai
 Tamil Nadu's Dinesh Karthik, another contender for the Test squad, has also scored more runs than Parthiv in Ranji and Duleep Trophy this season
 karthik ne is sijan main ranjai kii 9 pariyon main 574 ran banaae hai jabaki dilip trophy main unki ransankhya paanch pariyon main 211 ran hai
 Parthiv has scored 109 runs in four innings in the Duleep Trophy
 31 varshiya karthik ko parthiv kii tulana main behatar wicketiper mana jaataa he
 He has played more Tests, odis and T20s than Parthiv
 dinesh ne 23 test, 71 vanade or 9 tii20 main team india kaa pratinidhitiv kiya he
 One century in Test matches is also recorded in the name of Dinesh Karthik
 tippaniyan It is possible that considering the young age of Rishabh and his batting style, he was not given a chance in the Test team, but why the selectors ignored the claim of two other wicketkeepers, batsmen Naman Ojha and Dinesh Karthik
 Is beyond
 team india kaa hissaa rah chuke naman ojha ne riddhimaan saaha kii gairmaujuudagi main 2015 main srilanka ke khilaaf ek test khelaa tha jisamen unhone 28 ke ausat se 56 ran banaae the
 33-year-old Naman had earlier impressed everyone by representing India 'A' team in Australia, scoring three consecutive centuries
 jaahir he ki pant, karthik or naman se behatar anke gaye parthiv ko ab mohali main behatar pradarshan kar aalochakon kaa munh band karnaa hoga

 Standing said that there is a large population of the world, who does a lot of hard work but their work does not come under the purview of labor

 Due to this, a lot of work of the people is not considered work, whereas they have to work hard for it
 ji standing ne kaha ki mere puraane arthshaastri mitra bina research paper padhe, payalat project ko dekhe basic inakam ko khaarij karte hai
 Referring to his project in Gujarat, Standing said that there are more than 3000 government schemes in the state, how much money is spent in it

 The possibility of Kohli coming down with a changed combination in batting cannot be ruled out
 yahaan kedaar jadhav ko baahar bheja ja saktaa he
 Rishabh Pant and Shreyas Iyer had brought India to a respectable score by playing half-century innings in Chennai, but in the end they did not get much runs after both were dismissed
 ballebaaji or gendbaaji main to bharat sangyojan badal saktaa he, lekin uski ek or chintaa fielding he
 Fielding of India from T20 to ODI has not been very good

 It is the most talked about and equally controversial novel by Rajkamal Chaudhary
 par itnaa kaaljayi bhi ki agar vah keval yahi upanyaas likhte, to bhi hindi sahitya main amar rahete
 The reason is its subject and its presentation
 yah upanyaas mahilaon ke samalangik sambandhon par likhaa ek kathanak bhar nahin varan maanav vyavhaar kaa ek dastavej bhi he
 Today, even though in 2018, the Supreme Court has removed homosexual relations from the category of crime, but imagine five decades ago
 bhartiya samaaj main, khaskar hindi pattee main to aisi baton kii charchaa bhi varjit thi, aise daur main is vishay par likhane kii himakat karnaa to vaaki bahut hi badi baat
 Rajkamal Chaudhary not only wrote it, but also argued in its favor
 20 july, 65 ko unhone likhaa tha, 'lesbian’
 
 
 
 
 That is, very little has been written about women immersed in homosexual acts, especially in Hindi
 bhartiya striyon ke nijee charitra ko nangi ankhon se dekhne kaa avasar or 'sanyog' ham logon ko nahin mil paata he
 Somewhere because of the clutter, and elsewhere because of the clutter!
 
 
 'america or pashchimi samaaj main mahilaon kii shaareerik aazaadee or usapar likhi kitabon kaa zikr karte hue unhone saaf kiya tha ki 'hamaare desh main janaana 'club' nahin hai or na hi yahaan kii 'desi' auraton ko aadhunik taur-tareekon se yah sab karne sahane kii jaankaree hi he
 Most of the women of our country are unable to understand what they are doing, and how they are doing, even while indulging in homosexual conduct
 
 
 karti hai avashya lekin neend main, nashe main, anjaane kar leti hai
 And, stuffed in their mischiefs and blindness, they remain more 'religious' and more anxious'
 
 
 'vaaki bhartiya sahitya main stri se jude daihik vishay, uski shaareerik jaruratein or samasyaayein, saamaajik shaleenta kii oot main to dhankati hi raheen, dharm, samskruti, shleelata or suchita ke naam par bhi use dabaaya jaataa rahaa
 This is the reason that many of the people singing 'abla Jeevan Hi Tumhari Ye Kahani' Rudali were able to muster the courage to write their sexual repression
 jin kuch lekhakon ne in vishyon, samasyaon par likhaa, un par vaicharik vikruti or saste sahitya lekhan ke aarope lage
 But Rajkamal Chaudhary has never been afraid of such criticisms
 vah aise vishyon par maithili, hindi, bengali, angreji main likhte rahe
 His creativity came in many forms like poet, novelist, storyteller, playwright, screenwriter
 raajakmal choudhary ke andar yah majbootee shaayad apni jindagi kii yaayavarta, ghumkkad yayavari or bindaasapan se ai thi
 It is said that he was introduced to a student named Shobhana in Kishorevay, towards whom he was attracted
 alam yah tha ki shobhana ke pita kaa sthanantaran jab bhagalpur ho gaya, to uski najdiki paane ke liye vah bhagalpur chale gaye or vahaan daakhila le liya, lekin vipareet halaat main padhai puri nahin kar sake
 Could not marry the girl he had fallen in love with
 paariwarik dabaav main pehali shaadi chanpura darbhanga kii shashikanta se hui
 He got married to Savitri Sharma of Mussoorie during the days of family upheaval
 savitri kaaphi dhani parivaar kii thim, lekin unka rishta saal bhar bhi nahin tikaa
 While in Mussoorie, he fell in love with Santosh, the niece of Savitri
 yah kram jeevanaparyant chalaa, par kehete hai ki aise sabandhon ke baavjood patni shashikanta se sampark kabhi chuta nahin
 Birthday Special: Rajkamal Chaudhary's two essential poems, manager Pandey, a famous critic of Hindi literature, says, "rajkamal Chaudhary was a rebellious man
 unka vidroh unke sahitya main bhi prakat hota he
 The compositions he composed could only be composed by him
 apni kavitaaon main to unhone durlabh prayog kiye
 He was one of the most educated writers of his time
 mahila mitron ko sahajata se aakarshith kar lenaa unka adbhut gun tha, shaayad isiilie vah mahilaon ko lekar itnaa kuch likh paae
 "rajkamal Chaudhary argued about his writings that even in our mythological legends, there has been a detailed depiction of the apsaras of heaven- Maneka, Urvashi, Rambha etc
 to break the austerities of sage Kanva, sage Parashar etc
 kalantar main stri-kriyaaon ko raajnneeti, satta, kharid-briki, bhoga-vilaas or jeevika ke saadhan ke rup main istemaal kiya jane laga
 Rajkamal examined women in her literature on a large scale and looked at the social, economic, political and psychological reasons behind her behavior, not looking at the woman through the prism of vulgarity
 hindi- maithili ke is prasiddh kavi-kahanikar kaa janm rampur haveli main 13 disambar, 1929 ko hua tha
 This place is in Saharsa, Bihar
 bikom kii padhai karne ke baad unhone kuch dinon tak patna sachivalay main clerki kii, par man nahin laga
 Quitted the job, moved around and adopted freelance writing
 hindi or maithili main khub likhaa, par jivan kaa kaaphi hissaa behad kareebi mitron ke saath bitaayaa
 It is said that he wrote rhythmic poems, influenced by one of his teachers at Nawada High School
 baad main unhen laga ki vah bhi kavitaayen likh sakate hai
 His first Maithili story Aparajita was published in Vaidehi magazine in 1954
 maithili main unhone kareeb 100 kavitaayen, teen upanyaas, 37 kahaniyaan, teen ekanki or chaar aalochanatmak niabandh likhe
 Rajkamal had gathered such creative experiences from his vagabond life that entrusted him with unmatched loving friends and unmatched creativity
 unke vrahat saahitiyik lekhan kaa adhikansh hissaa unke jeevankaal main aprakashit rahaa
 After his death, a lot of people got his works published as auspicious, but as Dr
 Devashankar Naveen, who published 'rajkamal Chaudhary Rachnavali' on Chaudhary's creation world in 2015, accepted that 37 years of hard-earned material Despite the publication of i am not in a position to claim that i have made all his compositions available
 abhi bhi hajaar prishth ke kareeb saamagree nishchay hi bikhri hui he, jinhen jutanaa shesh he
 Apparently, Naveen's book is missing a lot of references, including that when he died in Patna's Rajendra Surgical Ward on June 19, 1967, there were counting people, most notably his Banarasi cinematographer friend s Atibal
 raajakmal choudhary va es atibal patna main kai saalon tak rummet bhi rahe the
 The friendship of both of them was that when Rajkamal was in his life, which day was the girl, and what composition was there in his mind, even with the power of accounts
 donon kii dosti kaa alam yah tha ki raajakmal choudhary ke nidhan ke baad ganga ghat par unke sharir ke agni main prajvalit hone ke saath hi atibal ne ek bakse main apana camera or photography kaa saamaan bharaa or ‘raajakmal nahin, to patna nahin’ kahkar apana jamaa-jamaaya ‘naval studio’ chhod banaras kii raah pakad lee thi
 That 'naval Studio' in which do not know how many creators were written in immortal compositions
 jo raajakmal kaa ghoshit or fanishwarnath renu kaa aghoshit adda tha
 Rajkamal Prakashan covered a lot in his Rachnavali published in eight volumes, yet rajkamal-atibal missed the period
 dow devshankar naveen dwaara sampadit 'raajakmal choudhary rachanawali' ke pratham do khandon main kavita, tisare-chauthe khand main katha, paanchave-chathe khand main upanyaas, saatve khand main niabandh naatak va antim khand main patr-diary ko shaamil kiya gaya tha
 At the time of its inauguration at that time, historian D
, a friend of Rajkamal, was among the great legends of literature

 He was the first person who recognized the importance of corruption prevailing in our economy and permit raj and the incest of the newly born class

 Unfortunately, her most famous novel 'fish Murdered' became famous for her homosexuality, while the author herself considered female homosexuality as a disease and the method used to make a woman 'healthy' is 'demonic'
 rape'
 samalangik na rahanaa unke hisaab se ‘swasth’ hona he
 Barring this objection, the novel is so readable that when it came to me, i read it in an hour and a half of standing
 "aisa nahin he ki raajakmal choudhary jo likh rahe the, unhen uskaa abhas nahin tha
 He had faced opposition and neglect during his lifetime
 isiilie unhone ek baar likhaa tha ki sahitya main ashleelata aropit karne vaale 'police-manovriti' ke log unako na padhein, unki sehat ke liye yahi acha rahegaa
 Through Sita and God, he accurately depicts the rot of life, lifestyle, activity etc
 kisi se bhaagane yaa chupaane kaa unhone kabhi koi prayaas nahin kiya
 In his novels, he drew pictures of the modernity of metropolitan life, in which women were made the center for pleasure, luxury, fulfillment of desire and aspiration and lips
 hindi sahitya main raajakmal kaa yogadanhindi main bhi raajakmal ne lagbhag aath upanyaas, takreeban 250 kavitaayen, 92 kahaniyaan, 55 niabandh or teen naatak likhe
 His Hindi poetry writing began around 1950 and increased considerably after 1956

 sahitya ajtak kii ore se hindi-maithili sahitya ke is bold lekhak ko naman! Usually Robert Vadra, who is a target of media, is a great devotee of Hanuman ji
 ajtak se baat karte hue unhone kaha ki hanuman ji main unki bahut aasthaa he, isliye wo hanuman ji ke darshan karne unki jayanti ke din mandir jarur jate hai
 After that they themselves feed the poor with their own hands
 hanuman jayanti ke maike par robert wadrapahele hanuman mandir gaye or uske baad ames ke baahar garib bacchon, buudhon or mahilaon ko apane haath se paros kar khaanaa khilaate najar aae
 Photos captured in today's camera suddenly Robert Vadra in a white SUV landed outside AIIMS without SPG protection and was seen serving food outside AIIMS along with a fellow NGO
 ye silsilaa takreeban 1 ghante tak chalaa pehle roti banti phir haath main chammach lekar daal khud parosane lage
 He then distributed pudding and biscuits
 baantate vakt robert bacchon se khub baat karte dikhe
 Sometimes when he asked someone about his new hairstyle, sometimes a child hid a packet of biscuits and then asked if he smiled and looked joking
 is dauraan aas-paas bheed lag gai, guzarane vaale robert kaa video banane lage
 So some people started taking photos
 khaanaa khaane waalon ne jahaan robert ko dhanyavad kiya, guzarane vaale bolte dikhe, wo dekho sonia gandhi kaa damaad
 After feeding everyone after about an hour, we asked Robert, what is special today, he replied that, i do this often, and then today is Hanuman Jayanti, i see Lord Hanuman from the temple and eat the poor here Came to feed ye main publicity ke liye nahin karata, mujhe sukun miltaa he isliye karata hum
 Overall, at a time when the discussion within the Congress is in full swing, how to remove the Muslim appeasement imposed on the party
 aise vakt main robert kaa avatar jarur chaunkaata he
 The son-in-law of the Gandhi family may describe his move as personal, but he comes from such a large political family, whose family's every step taken on the public platform is bound to be seen in the politics itself
 dilli ke up mukhyamantri manish sisodiya ne NDTV india se kaha ki mahilaayein chaahe dilli kii hon yaa noida, gajiabad, gudgaanv yaa faridabad kii, sabake liye bas or metro main yatra muft kii jaaegi
 Manish Sisodia said that '1000 new buses will come to Delhi this year
 is baaki bache hue saal main 700 se 800 karod rupee kaa kharch aayega
 He said that if we are saying that the government will pay the fare of the metro, then what could be the problem for Delhi Metro? lekin bijepi iske kilaaf kutark kar rahi he
 If women get free travel facility then what is the problem of BJP in this? kya aapako mahilaon se samasya he? unke liye hone vaale kaam se samasya he?'unhone kaha ki 'ab main khud bas main jaaoongaa or janata se baat karuunga

 He said that by spreading controversy on such topics, there should be no disguise in society
 bhaiyaji ne kaha ki sai baba ne kabhi apane ko devtaa nahin kaha
 Although he also said that Kishinkaracharya has his own views, such controversial issues should be avoided
 'rajyasabha main BJP ko bahumat nahin'bhaiyaji joshi ne ram mandir ke mudde par bhi apane vichaar rakhe

 aaie jaanate hai kisi bani he yah film

 For some reason, his father (adil Hussain) deals Preeti through human trafficking
 jisaki vajah se sonia pareshaan ho jaati he or apni bahan kii talash main shahar dar shahar bhatakati he

 Its writing is tremendous and the manner of telling the story is praiseworthy

 There is also a great example in the story for the reason of involvement in body trade and their disposal
 film kii casting dilachasp he
 Even in a large crowd of characters, each and every character in itself seems to be necessary and accurate
 riya sisodiya ne bahut hi badhiya abhinay kiya he
 At the same time, Mrinal Thakur has played the title role well
 lagata nahin he ki ye unki pehali film he
 The rest of the starcasts of the film like Richa Chadha, Freida Pinto, Sai Tamhankar, Rajkumar Rao, Manoj Bajpayee, Anupam Kher, Adil Hussain, Demi Moore have done very well according to their respective characters
 film kii asli hero isaki kahani he
 Whilst looking at it, it seems completely clear that all the research work must have been done behind it
 film kaa becoground score kaaphi dilachasp he jo ki kahani ke sang sang chalata he
 Weak Links: The weak link of the film is probably its 'A' certificate

 Also, people who watch masala movies may dislike it
 box oficeksar dekha gaya he ki bahut saare film festival main tarifen batorne vaali filmembox officepar zyada kamai nahin kar paatin
 Because he has a special kind of audience and some similar film is also with Sonia
 dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki gambhir mudde par aadhaarit is kahani ko dekhne kitni audiyans theatre pahunchati he
 Manoj Tiwari's Secretariat's Circular quoted Davamnej Tiwari as saying - AAP is fooling the people of Delhi, will the people of Delhi get electric shock after elections? Will the Kejriwal government make a power round to 200 units free of cost to Delhiites after 31 March 2020? BJP and AAP have come face to face with regard to free electricity scheme
 chunaav kaa samay jaise jaise najadik aa rahaa he vakyuddh badhata ja rahaa he
 Manoj Tiwari claims this, citing a circular obtained from the secretariat of the Kejriwal government by Delhi BJP president
 agast main jari hue is dastavej kii mail ajtak ko bhi mili
 According to this document, Manoj Tiwari says that government schemes are implemented only after fixing the time limit
 is circular se saaf he ki dilli sarkaar dilli waalon ko murkh bana rahi he
 This is sheer cheating
 'kejariwal sarkaar ne kiya aaropon kaa khandantiwari ne ye bhi kaha ki yojanaayen hameshaa ke liye hoti hai
 Like NDA government's Ayushman Yojana or Ujjwala scheme are not just for a couple of years but for a long time
 vahiin kejariwal sarkaar ne 31 march tak hi is yojana ko manjuuri dekar apni manshaa saaf kar di he
 People should understand and be cautious
 kyonki bijepi saaf kah rahi he haalanki kejariwal sarkaar ne fouran tiwari ke aaropon kaa khandan kar diya he
 Atishi said that Manoj Tiwari has issued a statement saying that Manoj Tiwari should increase his general knowledge that every year the budget for the schemes is allocated according to the financial year
 aatishi ne jor diya ki 200 unit bijli har maheene free dene kii yojana lambii avadhi kii yojana he
 After coming to power next year, the budget will be allocated again under this head

 Now whether it is a government auction of onions or the businessmen have to sell onions by filling the train at the cost of a lot of money
 sarkari khajaane ko chuunaa lagane vaale is sharmnaak khel kaa india today kii tahakikat main khulaasa hua he
 Onion is not only an important part of people's food, but in the past it has also become a cause of tears in many governments
 haalanki madhya pradesh kii saarvajanik vitaran pranali (PDS) ne ateet se koi sabak nahin liya dikhataa he
 a sharp investigation by the Investigative team of India Today revealed how the state's food supply chain is involved in the planned robbery of onions from government procurement centers
 sarkari aankadon ke mutabik varsh 2016-17 main madhya pradesh main 32 lakh metric ton pyaaj kaa utpaadan hua
 The joy of bumper production was eradicated from the faces of farmers at a time when the price of onion fell sharply
 naaraaz kisaanon ne beete maheene iske iske virodh main bade paimaane par pradarshan bhi kiya
 The Shivraj Singh Chauhan government, which came in opposition to the onion-producing farmers, hurriedly bought 9 lakh tonnes of onions at the rate of Rs 8 per kg at a much lower support price
 kaayade se jo pyaaj kharida gaya use adhiktam sambhavit keemat par kaarobaariyon ko nilaam kiya janaa chahie tha
 But this was exactly the opposite, which India Today under-cover reporter found out from his investigation
 jinke upar jimmedaari thi, unheen naukarshahon ne chand vyapaariyon ko phayda pahunchane ke liye puri nilaamee prakriya kaa hi makhul bana kar rakh diya
 This whole game of cheating the state exchequer was done by charging a bribe from the traders

 Sony guaranteed that the final bid would not be more than 10 paise from the original of Rs 2 per kg

 After the news was shown on Aaj Tak, the government has suspended General Manager Shrikant Soni

 This whole Gorakhdhandha was shown in a very planned manner

 aisa bhi kiya jaataa he ki saare utpaada ko hi kharaab kah kar khaarij kar diya jaae jisase pratispardhaatmak bikri kaa makasad hi naakaam ho jaae
 The investigation revealed that those who are really big wholesalers are kept away from the auction site

 They are told that no auction is going on

 echdi kumaraswami ko raajnneeti apane pita echdi devgauda se viraasat main mili he
 JD-S Chief Ministerial candidate Kumaraswamy has entered the electoral arena with full force to become kingmaker again after a decade
 ve party kaa pramukh cheharaa hai
 Kumaraswamy is working on a strategy that the Congress and the BJP cannot come to power with an absolute majority in any case
 or trishanku nattejey aane par kumaraswami apni ahm bhoomika adaa kar saken
 The old Mysore region, also known as southern Karnataka, is considered to be the strongest region of the JDS
 mysore, hasan, mandya or tumkur jile sahit bengalooru ke simavarti kshetron main kumaraswami kii party jedies kaa prabhaav kshetra he
 Their entire dependency is also dependent on this area
 kumaraswami vidhansabha chunaav main do siton se maidan main hai
 It includes one Ramanagara and another Channapattan seat
 varsh 2013 main unhen ramanagar par 40 hajaar voton se jeet mili thi, lekin unki patni anitha kumaraswami channpattan seat se haar gai thi
 Withholding the majority, Kumaraswamy, who has been doing rambling rallies just six months after conducting the motiveheart operation, has only one objective, to stop the bjp-congress from a straight victory
 jedies chaahati he ki agar vidhansabha trishanku hogi to vah karnataka main phir se kingmekar ban jaaegi
 Let us know that Kumaraswamy has previously secured the post of Chief Minister of Karnataka without getting the majority figure
 kingmekar banane kii chahat2006 main congress ke saath matbhed ke baad kumaraswami ne gathbandhan todakar bijepi se haath milaayaa
 It was decided that both the parties would run the government for 20-20 months
 pehle kumaraswami siem kii kursi par baithe lekin apana kaarykaal khatm hone ke baad unhone bijepi ko samarthan dene se inkaar kar diya or pradesh main raashtrapati shashan laga
 Cheluvarai Swamy and Zameer Ahmed Khan, considered to be Kumaraswamy's right hand, have been included in the Congress a few months back
 agar bijepi yaa congress main se koi bhi dal purna bahumat ke saath sarkaar banaata he to jedies ke saamne astitv kaa sankat aa jayega
 India has sharply criticized the UN Security Council for putting months into banning leaders of groups declared terrorist organizations on its own
 uskaa yah etraj pakistani aatankwaadi sanghathan jaish-e-mohammad ke mukhiya par pratibandh lagane kii bharat kii koshish ko takneekee aadhaar par khatai main daalane par tha
 India's Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Syed Akbaruddin, on Monday lambasted the council over its failure to ban leaders of terrorist organizations, saying that the Security Council is stuck in its own time trap and politics
 akbaruddin ne suraksha parishad ke samtamulak pratinidhitiv or sadsyta main vruddhi par yojit ek satr ko sambodhit karte hue kaha, jahaan har din is yaa us kshetra main aatankwaadi hamaari samuhik antaratma aahat karte hai, suraksha parishad ne isapar vichaar karne main nau maah lagaae ki kya apane hi haathon aatankwaadi ikai qaraar die gaye sanghathanon ke netaaon par pratibandh lagaaya jaae yaa nahin
 Earlier this year, China imposed a technical moratorium on India's move to make Azhar a terrorist at the United Nations
 takneekee sthagan kii chah maah kii muddat der sitambar main khatm ho gai thi or china ne teen maah kaa ek doosraa sthagan chaha tha
 The Indian diplomat expressed regret at the endless series of turtle-driven discussions on reform in the UN Security Council and said that it was time to break the deadlock for immediate reform of the world body, which was not prepared for the current global situation
 akbaruddin ne rekhaankit kiya ki is saal maanviya sthitiyon, aatankwaadi khataron or shantirakshan kii samasyaon ke prati kadam uthaane main aakshamata ahm maamalon main pragati karne main vishwa samudaay kii kami kii keemat kaa hissaa hai jise chukaaya ja rahaa he
 "we have seen fragmented actions in dealing with issues critical to international security like Syria and other situations like peacekeeping crisis like South Sudan which were not implemented even after months of consent
" bhartiya rajanyik ne kaha ki, aisa kaha ja saktaa he ki samay or siyasat ke apane hi jaal main uljhi suraksha parishad tadarthwaad or raajnneetik panguta ke aadhaar par jaise taise kaam kar rahi he
 He said that the international community is shocked by the endless series of discussions on reform of the United Nations Security Council because despite its importance and urgency, significant reform of the Security Council is being delayed
 akbaruddin ne kaha, sattar saal pehle tay kii gai isaki sadsyta, khaas kar sthai shrenee main pratinidhitiv kii kami isaki vaidhata or saakh kii kami main ijapha karti he
 He hoped that during the tenure of the current United Nations General Assembly President Peter Thomson, there would be a process to pursue reform

 jaankaree mili ki mahesh travel company ek din ke liye 12 hajaar rupee main asi lakjri bas uplabdh karaati he
 If these buses are used for 15 days, then it will cost around 15 lakh rupees only
 iske alaava is artiai activist ne 2004 se 2018 tak hue sabhi adhiveshan ke kharche kaa hisaab maanga tha
 Data from 2004 to 2012 are not available

 The issue of the Ram janmabhoomi-babri Masjid dispute in Ayodhya is once again moving forward in the Supreme Court
 guuruuvaar ko supreme court main is masale kii sunwaayee shuru hui to kai adchanon ke baad ise 29 janvari tak ke liye taal diya gaya
 While the lawyer of the Muslim side, Rajiv Dhawan questioned Justice UU Lalit being in the bench, the lawyers of the Hindu Mahasabha also said that the translation related to this issue should be investigated
 in do mukhya kaarnon ko dekhte hue hi supreme court ne is masale ko 29 janvari tak ke liye taal diya
 The Supreme Court says that by January 29, a new bench will be formed on this issue and the translation of the documents will be confirmed afresh

 Apart from this, the High Court verdict is 4304 pages
 maamle se jude mul dastavej arabi, farsi, sanskrit, urdu or gurmukhi main likhe gaye hai
 Lawyers said before the Supreme Court that the parties who have translated these documents also need to be confirmed
 ab supreme court ne is pushti ko bhi 29 janvari tak puraa karne ko kaha he
 Let me tell you that even before this case came in the Supreme Court
 tab kul 9000 pannon ke dastavej, 9 xxrep 4 0 pannon main hindi-arabi-urdu-farsi-sanskrit ke dharmik dastavej the

 haalanki, kai jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki itane adhik sankhya main dastavejon kaa veriphekashan karnaa itane kam samay main karnaa naammumkin he
 Because even earlier when the translation was done in Hindi language, the lawyers had asked for translation in English

 Cess will increase my most burden In the third budget of Arun Jaitley, i am afraid of being burdened with many new cesses

 Driving on the road will be expensive
 In India, this time budget congestion tax is also being started

 The price of electricity will increase according to which taxes have been imposed by the government, experts say that the rate of electricity is also likely to increase further

 It was a long time that the Modi government would make some big announcements in this direction, but there was only a slight benefit in this
 mahangaai kaa badhanaa takib tak jitna padhaa or samajha
 Even though the government is describing the budget as pro-people, the experts are crying out that there is no concrete strategy on inflation

 yaman ke sankatagrast raashtrapati abedrobo mansoor haadi gurunar riyaad pahunche jo unke shashan ko khatra paidaa kar rahe shiya vidrohiyon ke khilaaf ek gathbandhan kaa netritv kar rahaa he
 Simultaneously, Saudi Arabia bombed the rebels in support of Hadi by airstrikes
 saudi press agency ke mutabik hawaii adde par haadi kii agavaani saudi rakshaamantri bin salmaan ne kii jo huti shiya vidrohiyon ke khilaaf kareeb ek darjan deshon ke sainya abhiyaan ko dekh rahe hai
 The Saudi-led Arab coalition carried out airstrikes as part of a campaign against Shiite rebels in Yemen, while Iran warned that intervention in Yemen was a 'dangerous' move
 iran ke raashtrapati hasan ruhani ne yaman main saudi arab ke sainya hastkshep kii ninda kii or kshetra main sabhi deshon se aagrah kiya ki ve apane padosi ke andruni maamalon se dur rahen
 Morocco has also joined the Saudi coalition for military action in Yemen
 saudi arab ke grih mantri ne seemaa par suraksha kadi karne ke aadesh die
 The unrest in Yemen has been increasing since the Hudi rebels began their efforts to seize power in Sanaa in February and they are now fighting in Aden
 america main saudi arab ke rajdoot adil al jubair ne kaha, 'abhiyaan ke bhugolic vitaran kii baat kii jaae to yah abhiyaan kisi ek vishesh shahar yaa kshetra main simit nahin he
 ' taj mahal kitna safed hona chahie? is sawaal kaa sahi jawaab to sirf mughal samraat shahjahan hi de sakate the jinhone rajasthan ke makraana kii khadaanon se nikle shuddh safed sangemarmar sang-e-rukhm se apane mehboob kii yaad main aisa makbara banwaaya tha, jo dekhne waalon ke liye din main kai dafe rang badalata thah suryoday par dudhia safed, bhari dopaher main chamchamata safed, suryaast ke samay halki naarangi abha ke saath or raat main indradhanushi nila
 So how should the Taj be considered white? This question has started to arise especially since the Supreme Court recently reprimanded the Central and Uttar Pradesh governments for the plight of the memorial and the gradual change of color to beige
 kendriya samskruti rajya mantri mahesh sharma ne bayaan diya, ''har kisi ko aashwast karata hum ki taj kii sanrachana par philhal koi khatra nahin mandara rahaa he or iske mul rang main bhi koi badlaav nahin aayaa he
 "the government is planning to compare the 100-year-old photographs of the Taj with fresh photographs with the help of stereoscopic imaging and present it as evidence in the Supreme Court
" yah kahana mushkil he ki sarkaar kya khoj nikaalegi
 If you believe the eye sight, then gradually the marble in the Taj Mahal has turned yellow in the past 40 years (despite the continuous removal of the clay layer from the marble)
 aisa kyon ho rahaa he?1980 or 90 ke dashak main to is sawaal kaa chhutate hi jabaav miltah mathura main tel rifinary ke rup main ek aisa rakshas he jo apane munh se lagaataar sulfur dioxide (so2) ugalta he
 His smoke hovers over the crown
 vah (so2) hawa main maujuud nami ke saath milakar salphurik acid bana letaa he or phir taj par tejabi barish hoti he
 This is why its marble is slowly being destroyed
 jahrili hawa taj ke ksharan kaa pramukh kaarak he, jo 'marble cancer' karke usko nuksaan pahunchaa rahaa he
 According to many experts, air pollution is most responsible for the health of the Taj and special treatment is needed to bring the Taj back to its original color
 kuch logon ke mutabik, ek nishchit vakt ke baad kisi bhi cheez main hraas hota he or taj ke saath bhi yahi ho rahaa he
 So, the Taj needs special repairs, so that it can be given the old look
 athens se lekar china tak, duniyabar main maujuud pracheen aitihaasik or saanskrithik viraasaton ke saath yahi pareshaani ai he
 Conservators have been trying for many decades in conservation work to restore the old dignity of these monuments that are facing pollution and time
 lekin iity-kanpur ke rajeev and sangeeta lahidi chair ke professor or civil ejineering and arth sciensej ke adhyaksh sachchidanand treepathi ke mutabik, pashchimi deshon ke ulat bharat main sulfur dioxide (so2) koi samasya nahin he
 "SO2 converts to sulfates," says Tripathi
 isaki prakruti amleey he
 If there is sufficient amount of acid in the environment around you, then there will be strong rain
 '' lekin bharat main bahut adhik dhulkan hai jisaki prakruti kshareey he
 The calcium and other minerals found in it are also alkaline
 ve bataate hai, ''ye sabhi milakar amleey pradooshan ko beasar kar dete hai
 That is why the problem of acid rain is not so much in our country
 yah baat pramanit bhi he
 Otherwise, the torrential rains would have damaged our crops and river water
 '' treepathi ne shodhakartaaon kii ek antarrashtriya team ke saath 2014 or 2017 ke bich taj main vaayu pradooshan par shodh kiya he
 Their research has shown that poor quality of air is responsible for the crowning and erosion of the Taj
 (so2) nahin balki dhulakanon kii saghantah blike carbon (kaalikh), bhura carbon or dhul kii jamaavat, jo mukhya taur par shahar main maanav gatividhiyon kii vajah se hai
 These include emissions from burning of diesel and smoke from vehicles, burning of garbage, wood and cow dung etc
 on behalf of the municipality
 yah beete 40 varshon main taj kii raksha ke liye kiye gaye upayon par sawalia nishaan lagaataa he
 Over the years, along with the formation of commissions of experts and committees, studies and surveys have been conducted, reports have been coming
 vaigyanikon or niti nirmaataaon ne anya pradooshkon (carbon or nitrogen ke oxide, dhul or hydrocarbon) ke prabhaavon ko hameshaa andekha kiya or sabakaa dhyaan bas SO2 par rahaa
 Many committees and commissions were not even aware of this subject and many others tried to influence the administration without evaluating the environmental impact
 phir hairaani kya ki supreme court kii ore se utsarjan kii nigaraanee ke baavjood taj ne apana rang badalanaa jari rakhaa
 The last 40 years are simply a tale of changing focus and lost priorities: pollution from small industrial units in the 90s, starting with SO2 emanating from the Mathura refinery in the '80s; Then in the early 2000s, from concerns over emissions from diesel generators and vehicle pollution to the theory of Yamuna erosion until recently

 'hafiz said kii ore se shahrukh or bhedbhaav ke shikaar dusaremusalamaanon ko pakistanane ke nyote par adityanath ne kaha ki unako pakistan chale janaa chahie
 Significantly, Hafiz Saeed tweeted after the controversy over Shahrukh Khan's statement saying, 'any Muslim, even Shahrukh who is facing problems and discrimination in India due to being a Muslim, is welcome to stay in Pakistan

 tathysangat vimarsh main ruchi lene vaale ek mitra se jab maine pichley saptaah kaha ki desh main bijli kaa utpaadan maang se zyada yani sarplus ho gaya he to unke maathe par bal pad gaye
 They were not unfamiliar with the technical parameters like peak demand, average and regional surplus in the power system, but fed up with frequent power outings, my friend was not sweating the sweat that the power was becoming more demanding than it really was
 unki yah hairat us madhyavargeey upabhokta jaisi hi thi jo sabji, tel, daal kharidte samay yah nahin samaj paata ki mahangaai yani mudrasphiti main record kami ke aankade brahmad ke kis grah se aate hai
 Similarly, reading the results of loss of employment, drought conditions, fall in demand and corporate sales, eight per cent of the economic growth rate (7
 9 fisadi) ke kareeb pahunchane ke taaja aankade ek tilismi duniya main pahunchaa dete hai
 The three figures we have mentioned above may be technically correct, but perhaps in a large country, it is more important to get the data practically correct, even if statistical scales are durable in intellectual debate if large And if the key figures are cut from practical reality, then their political credibility is doubtful
 sabase pehle bijli ko len, jo garmi main sabase zyada chhakaati he
 As soon as the Central Electricity Tribunal (CEA) said that this year the power generation will be more than the surplus, then the Twitter handle of many ministers came up
 siie ne bataaya tha ki desh main peak demand (sarvaadhik maang ke samay) or non peak demand (ausat maang) ke samay, bijli kaa utpaadan maang se kramash 3
 1 percent and 1
 1 fisadi zyada rahegaa
 The figure is based on the demand and supply of electricity, varying by hours and location
 sarkaar ne koyale kii behatar aapurti ke aadhaar par bijli utpaadan main kranti kaa daawa kiya to congressi kah uthe ki kaam to pichley ek dashak main hua he, bijepi sarkaar to uski malai kha rahi he
 However, if there is a lot of power cut in your area (which is true of all India) then it is impossible to trust the claim of producing more electricity than demand
 alabatta agar takneekee cheer-faad karen to lagegaa ki siie baja farmaata he
 The CEA averaged the demand and supply of electricity across the country at a specified time (may also be an hour), which seems to indicate a surplus in production
 yah sthiti pichley saal kii tulana main behatar he
 Despite the fact, it is important to understand that even in the worst years in India, power generation has been surplus in the states at different times, but with this many other parts of the country always suffer power cuts
 kai jagah bijli companiyaan ghaataa kam karne ke liye katautee karti rahati hai
 So even though the figure of instant surplus production of electricity is technically correct, this is often the opposite of the daily experience of often missing power this summer, which makes the government's vehement claim rather irritable
 april main badhat darj karne se pehle tak thok keemton vaali mahangaai pichley 18 maheene se shunya se neeche thi
 Retail inflation also came down to five per cent before the latest increase
 aankade siddhanthata sahi ho sakate hai, lekin yahaan bhi takneekee pech he
 The data on which the retail inflation rate is based is collected from 310 towns and 1,180 villages
 is vyavastha main galatiyon kii bharpoor gunjaaish he
 The index which is formed by these weak figures, the share of prices of seasonal items (vegetables, fruits), milk and pulses is less
 kapadon, shiksha parivahan ke kharchon kii gananaa kaa formula bhi purana he
 So the inflation which is often felt by standing at a vegetable shop, the figures of inflation decreases seems to rub salt on it
 bharat main jidipi ke taaja aankade to kalpanaaon kii baazeegari hai
 In the March 2016 quarter, about 51% of GDP growth came due to discrepancies or inconsistencies
 chaunkiye nahin, jidipi kii gananaa ke formule main ek kaarak kaa naam hi asangati he
 In the absence of concrete figures, the government takes a rough view of production and expenditure and the growth of GDP is fixed
 yah andaja hi asangati he
 Principal head of government TCA Anant had to say that due to the delay in getting the figures, there are too many inconsistencies
 lekin kitni zyada? is asangati ke khate ne march, 2016 kii timahi main jidipi main 143 lakh karod ru
 Production of Rs
 29,933 crore in the same quarter of 2015
 tha
 Data experts believe that if this gift of incompatibilities is removed from GDP, then GDP growth in the March quarter is 7
 9 nahin balki 3
 9 percent will be reduced, because apart from these, the increase in government spending is modest, private investment and exports have fallen, due to which GDP increases
 dhyaan rakhana jaruri he ki vikaas or badlaav sankhyaon main nahin, jameen par mahasoos hota he jaisaa ki railway kii sevaaon main yaa kaale dhan ko lekar najar aa rahaa he

 sarkarein hameshaa apni uplabdhiyon kaa prachaar karti hai lekin aankadon main gafalat saakh ke liye khatarnaak ho sakati he
 In the last two years, investor confidence in government economic data has decreased
 ve aankadon kii swatantra padtaal ko majaboor ho rahe hai
 Government claims may be technically correct, but if the data is inconsistently and pragmatically cut off, the opposite of their pleasantness creates a competitive dialogue that fills even factual efforts for betterment with negativity and skepticism

" " Delhi Women's Commission chairperson Swati Maliwal has been on hunger strike for the last four days
 telugana main vetaneri doctor ke gang rape or hatya ke khilaaf unhone dharna jari kiya
 But then cases were added to it one after another
 chahen unnav main balaatkaar kii shikaar peedita ko jalaakar maarane kii koshish kaa maamla ho yaa phir nirbhaya maamle main ek aaropee kii dayaa yachika raashtrapati se sweekaar naa karne kii apil ho
 Swati is on hunger for all these women
 isse pehle 2018 main kathua gang rape maamle main bhi dilli mahila ayog kii adhyaksh ne 14 din kii bhukh hadtaal kii thi
 However, the President has also rejected the mercy petition in the Nirbhaya case
 mahilaon ke khilaaf hone vaali hinsa ke krurtam maamalon main insaaf dilaane ke liye har baar swati hi kyon saamne aati hai? aakhir duusare rajyon ke mahila ayog kii adhyaksh kahaan hai?charchit unnav balaatkaar maamle se duuri baratane par aalochanaon kaa shikaar raheen vimala batham ne kaha swati kar raheen siyastunnav us samay deshbhar main charchaa main aayaa jab 2017 main naaballig ladki ke saath balaatkaar kaa hyprophile maamla saamne aayaa
 The name of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Kuldeep Sengar was directly linked to the matter, due to which it became a political issue
 lekin balaatkaar peedita ke parivaar se se 4 din baad milane pahunchi rajya mahila ayog kii adhyaksh vimala batham ne pariwa ke saath bamushkil 10 minute bitaye
 While Vimala Batham attended the Teej Festival on the second day of rape
 isaki photo unhone soshal media par saajha bhi kii
 Vimala Batham was severely criticized in this case
 haalanki do din pehle unnav main balaatkaar peedita ko jalaakar maarane kii koshish ke maamle main unhone sakriyata barti
 Batham said that to gather all the facts of the case, the State Women's Commission formed a team of two members and also wrote a letter to the DGP UP to punish the culprits of the case
 haalanki patr mail karne yaa phir vatrup ke jariye bhejne se unhone yah kehete hue inkaar kar diya ki vah lakhanu se baahar hai
 Asked her why Swati, like Maliwal, is not pressurizing the Uttar Pradesh Women's Commission government? Vimala Batham says, "swati is just doing politics
" ve media kawarej chaahati hai
 She works for the Delhi government i
e
 Aam Aadmi Party
 chunaav kareeb hai isile ab swati janata kii sahanubhuti bator rahi hai
 It is true that Swati Maliwal first joined the Aam Aadmi Party, then she became the chairperson of the Women's Commission, but Vimala Batham herself fought and won on the BJP ticket when Mahesh Sharma's seat was vacant
 to kya yah maananaa chahie ki bhaajapa main hone kii vajah se hi vah bhi hyprophile unnav rape maamle main kuldeep senger kaa naam judane kii vajah se hi lagaataar duuri banaae raheen? is par ve kahati hai, ayog kaa kaam dharna dena yaa anshan karnaa nahin he
 We pressurize the administration and the government in our own way
 telugana main 17 maheenon se ayog adhyaksh kaa khaali padaa padatelugana main balaatkaar maamle main mahila ayog kii chuppi kii vajah yahaan pichley 17 maheenon se adhyaksh kaa pad khaali hona he
 When the Telangana Women's Commission tried to find the phone number of the chairman, there was a mobile number written in front of the post, besides being vacant
 us par phone milaane par purv cheirperson ne phone uthaaya
 He told that this post has been vacant for more than one and a half years
 saat maheene pehle hi uttarakhand mahila ayog ko mili adhyaksh, par sampark karnaa nahin aasaan !duusari taraf uttarakhand mahila ayog ko kaaphi huzzat karne ke baad 7 maheene pehle adhyaksh naseeb hui
 However in the website of National Commission for Women (NCW) it is still written blank next to this post
 lekin saamne die number main kol karne par inakming kaal band hone kii jaankaree milti he
 When she calls another member, she says that the chair has been appointed 6-7 months ago after the post has been vacant for almost a year
 puducheri main bhi ek saal tak pad khaali rahane ke baad hui niyukti, number par nahin inakming suvidha!rajya main bhi farvari,2019 ko rajyapal kiran bedi ne adhyaksh pad or team kaa punargathan kiya
 The women's commission was completely closed after the former president's term ended in 2017
 haalanki encidblyoo kii website main yah bhi pad abhi bhi rikt dikh rahaa he
 The mobile number of Puducherry State Women's Commission is not present on the website
 website ke mutabik jammu-kashmir main bhi mahila ayog kaa pad khaali padaa he
 But calling the mobile number next to the post gives information about not having the incoming facility
 jammu-kashmir main bhi pad padaa khalirashtriya mahila ayog kii website ko sahi maane to jammu-kashmir mahila ayog kaa pad bhi khalihai
 After Article 370, the chairperson of the National Commission for Women, who had become sluggish here, had hoped to be active but till now there was no movement
 mahila ayog main adhyaksh pad kii niyukti or aayogon kii susti ko lekar jab rashtriya mahila ayog kii adhyaksh rekha sharma se kai baar koshish karne ke baad bhi baat nahin ho pai

 The Bhalesamajwadi Party is engaged in the praise of LK Advani, senior leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party
 par rashtriya janata dal ko yah nagavar gujara he
 RJD leader Ram Kripal Yadav reacted sharply that Advani does not become a secular leader after getting a certificate from someone
 mulaayam ke 'adwani prem'par unhone kaha ki main or meri party yah samaj nahin paa rahi he ki aakhirkaar sapa pramukh adwani or bijepi kii tarif kyon kar rahe hai?rajd netaa yahi nahin ruke
 He accused Lal Krishna Advani of disturbing the atmosphere of the country
 ramkripal yadav ne kaha ki babari masjid giraae jane ke alaava desh main sampradayik maahaul paidaa karne ke lielalkrishna adwankele jimmedaar hai
 On the role of the Third Front in the next Lok Sabha elections, he said that the Third Front has no existence in the near future
 mulaayam ne kii he adwani kii tarifgauratlab he ki kal tak bhartiya janata party ko sampradayik or phirakaaprast party kehane vaali sapa, in dinon bijepi netaaon kii tarif main juty he 
 SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav had praised Advani in Lucknow amid criticism of his son Akhilesh Yadav-led Uttar Pradesh government
 mulaayam ne kaha tha, ‘adwani sahab kehete hai ki uttar pradesh bahut buree sthiti main he or yahaan bhrashtachar charam par he
 When leaders like Advani say such a thing, i think i will have to review the situation
 vah kabhi jhooth nahin bolte
 As i have said many times that he always tells the truth, i will go and meet him again
 ’ To facilitate these foreign students, the Ministry of External Affairs would consider granting them research visas during the program and not a one-year visa at the same time
 yah samajha jaataa he ki sarkaar iaiti main zyada videshi chaatro ko padhaane ke liye utsuk he taaki apni antarrashtriya shaikshanik ranking ko badhaayaa ja sake
 It is understood that the government is keen to teach more foreign students in iits so as to raise its international academic ranking
 uttar pradesh main narendra modi ke vijay rath ko rokane ke liye sapa adhyaksh akhilesh yadav or basapa pramukh mayawati ne varshon puraani dushmani ko bhulaakar saath aa gaye
 Came along but there does not seem to be any charisma
 ajtak-exis maai india ke agsit pole ke mutabik modi-shah kii jodi ke saamne akhilesh-mayawati kii jodi puri tarah se dharaashai ho ti najar aa rahi he
 In such a situation, the question arises whether the sp-bsp's vote could not be transferred to each other, due to which the use of coalition seems to be completely failed
 agsit pole ke nattejeyajtak-exis maai india agsit pole ke mutabik soobe kii 80 loksabhaa siton main se bijepi gathbandhan ko 62-68 siten milti hui najar aa rahi hai
 While the SP-BSP-RLD alliance is expected to get 10 to 16 seats and the Congress 1 to 2 seats
 bijepi ko akele dam par 60 se 66 siten or apana dal ko 2 siten mil rahi hai
 While SP is getting 4 to 7 seats and BSP is getting 3 to 7 seats
 vahiin, congress ko ek se do siten mil sakati he
 Vote share in exit poll In view of the exit poll, the BJP alliance is getting 48% votes in Uttar Pradesh
 jabaki sapa-basapa-areldi gathbandhan ko 39 fisadi vot mil rahe hai
 At the same time, Congress seems to get only 8 percent and others 5 percent
 is tarah se sapa-basapa ke dalit, yadav or muslim maton kaa sameekaran koi asar dikhaata najar nahin aa rahaa
 Whereas bjp's 50 percent claim seems to be true
 yahi nahin isse yah baat bhi sabit ho rahi he ki jis mansoobey ke saath donon netaa ek saath aae the vah bhi safal hota nahin dikh rahaa
 In 2014, the vote share and whistleblowing thing was that NDA 42 in UP in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 30 fisadi voton ke saath 73 siten jeetne main safal hui
 While SP 22
 20 fisadi voton ke saath 5 siten or basapa 19
 Failed to open account with 60 percent votes
 vahiin, congress 7
 Managed to win 2 seats with 50 percent votes
 isi chunaav main sapa-basapa ke kul voton ko yadi mila diya jaae to vot share endie ke lagbhag pahunchataa dikhaa
 up's caste equation is currently 22 percent Dalit voters, 14 percent of which are Jatavs
 ye basapa kaa sabase majboot votbank he
 While the remaining 8 percent of the Dalit voters are 60 castes including Pasi, Dhobi, Khatik Musahar, Koli, Valmiki, Gond, Kharwar
 vahiin, 45 fisadi ke kareeb obisi matadaata hai
 Among them, Yadav is 10 percent, Kurmi 5 percent, Maurya 5 percent, Lodhi 4 percent and Jat 2 percent
 baaki 19 fisadi main gurjar, rajbhar, bind, biaar, mallaah, nishad, chaurasia, prajapati, lohaar, kahaar, kumhaar sahit 100 se zyada upjatiyaan hai
 Around 19 per cent are Muslims
 kya yadav-dalit-muslim formula fail?aise main sapa -basapa kaa mul votbank yadav, muslim or jatav mana jaataa he
 If the votes of these three communities are mixed, then it is 43 per cent
 lekin agsit pole main sapa-basapa-areldi gathbandhan ko 39 fisadi vot hi milane kaa anumaan he
 In such a situation, 4 percent of the votes are being reduced directly
 jabaki duusari ore bijepi apane mulvot bank savarna ke alaava gaiyr-yadav obisi or gaiyr jatav daliton ko apane khemen main jodne kii kavayad kii he
 BJP has been consistently saying in the state that we are working on adding more than 50 percent of the voters
 aise main agsit pole main bijepi gathbandhan ko kareeb 48 fisadi vot miltaa najar aa rahaa he
 If the exit poll results are correct, then in a way where the BJP succeeded in achieving its goal, the alliance failed completely
 haalanki loksabhaa siton ke hisaab se muslim-yadav-dalit aabaadi ke ganit ko dekhte hai to upi main har loksabhaa seat par 40 fisadi se adhik aabaadi muslim-yadav-dalit kii he
 Out of total 80 seats in UP, muslim-yadav-dalit population is more than 60 percent in 10 seats
 ye siten azamgarh, ghosi, dumriyaganj, firozabad, jonpur, ambedkar nagar, bhadohi, bijanour, mohanlalganj or sitapur hai
 Apart from this, muslim-yadav-dalit population is between 50-60 per cent in 37 seats, which includes Mulayam Singh's constituency Mainpuri and Congress's amethi-rae Bareli
 baaki kii 33 siton par muslim-yadav-dalit aabaadi lagbhag 40-50 fisadi he, jisamen piem modi kii varanasi seat bhi aati he
 According to exit polls, the alliance has not been able to completely stop modi-shah's Vijay Rath in the state
 aise main sidhe taur par mana ja rahaa he ki donon partiyon ke vot ek duusare ko transfar nahin ho sake

 a few days ago, Shiv Sena raised the issue of why the government was not giving water to the beer factories to the people of the affected areas? The Shiv Sena said that the government is more focused on beer factories

 There are 10 beer factories, in which 20% water reduction decree has been implemented

 The budget session of Parliament was completely washed away by the opposition
 jiske baad ab sarkaar kii taraf se hangaamaa kar rahi partiyon ko manaane kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 Due to the uproar, the House was repeatedly adjourned, due to which the money of the public is flowing like water

 The government, awakened by the government's door to door petition, has now started persuading and convincing the opposition parties

 Dismissing all the allegations, Vijay Goel said that the government has always wanted the functioning of the house, about 10 bills are pending in the Rajya Sabha and there are similar ones in the Lok Sabha

 inamen lagbhag do darjan bill shaamil hai
 Apart from discussing sensitive issues, the performance of both the Houses has been very disappointing even during the Zero Hour and Question Hour

 The first issue is the PNB scam, on which the opposition parties are constantly besieging and demanding a discussion
 PNB scam ke mukhya aaropee neerav modi to videsh bhaag gaya lekin uskaa khamiyaja sadak se lekar sansad tak aam janata ko bhugatna pad rahaa he
 Apart from the Andhra special status arithmetic, another big issue is that Andhra Pradesh gets special state status
 isi mudde ke kaaran NDA sarkaar ke ek vakt sahyogi rahi or ab dushman ban chuki telugu desham party ne wiesar congress se jaakar haath mila liya he
 When both parties rallied to get special status for Andhra Pradesh, the entire opposition went with them
 alam yah he ki donon kaa avishvaas prastaav kaa notice loksabhaa spikar ke paas padaa hua he or roj isi ko lekar satta paksh or vipaksh ke bich jabardast kheenchaatani machi rahati he
 Apart from these parties, the Congress has also expressed condolences to TDP on Friday on the same issue by giving a notice of no confidence in the Lok Sabha
 kaveri masale par gahamagahamiisi ke saath ediemke ke saansadon kaa hangaamaa bhi tidipi or wiesar congress ke saansadon ko takkar de rahaa he
 Whether the Rajya Sabha or the Lok Sabha gets an opportunity, AIADMK mps enter the well with a banner and poster and due to this the speaker or chairman has to adjourn the house
 vipakshi dal sarkaar par aarope laga rahe hai ki vah ediemke kaa istemaal charchaa se bhaagane ke liye kar rahi he
 The uproar over the deaths of the kidnapped Indians in Mosul was less like a ruckus on three issues, and recently the politics of the death of 39 Indian citizens has come to dominate everyone
 is masale par siyaasi roti sekane ke liye sabhi dal kud pade hai
 On the one hand, the government was shocked that before giving information to the victim's family, the Foreign Minister thought it better to make a statement in Parliament, while on the other hand, the opposition parties were accused of insensitivity

 The Congress spokesperson has also accused BJP president Amit Shah and Pankaja Mundeper of money laundering and illegal collection of money
 'bijepi kyon bhej rahi 3 karod nakad'iske saath hi surajevaala ne bijepi par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha, haal hi main gajiabad main pakadi gai ek car main do logon ke paas se teen karod rupee jabt kiye gaye the

 Attacking PM Modi, Rahul Gandhi said, 'moji Ji said that he is performing a yagna against corruption
 8 november ko unhone kaha ki main ek yajna kar rahaa hum or har yajna main kisi kaa kisi kii bali chadhati he

 ' The 1975 Amitabh Bachchan and Dharmendra starrer film 'sholay' is one of the iconic films of Indian cinema that will be remembered forever
 ramesh sippi ke nirdesan main bani is film ke dialogs aaj bhi logon ko yaad hai or isse jude aise tamaam kisse kahaniyaan hai jinhen aaj bhi log dhyaan se sunate hai
 But do you know that the film was released in Pakistan many years after its release in India? The film was released in India on 15 August 1975 and in Pakistan it was released in 2002 after 40 years
 saalon baad relies hone ke baavjood iske sholay kaa jaadu feekaa nahin padaa tha
 The film earned around Rs 28,12,140 in the first week after its release
 bollywood kaa wo dabang hero jisane musharraf ko pakistan main hi dho dalapakistan main sholay ke distributor ne bataaya ki yadi aap tulanaatmak dhang se dekhen to film ne phir bhi kaaphi behatar pradarshan kiya tha
 Now the question arises that why a film which made many records in India was not released in Pakistan? In fact, Pakistan banned Indian films after the 1965 war
 ek report ke mutabik pakistan main sholay ke distributor ne kaha, "aap lokapriyata ke maamle main sholay kii tulana pike se kar sakate hai, lekin aap ek 40 saal puraani film se yah ummid nahin kar sakate ki vah mahange multiplex theatre kii 30 se 40 fisadi siten bhar degi

 The February 13 order of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) to freeze the assets, bank accounts and demat accounts of the group's two unlisted companies and several of its top executives, including managing worker and chairman Subrata Roy Sahara, had no impact on employee enthusiasm Was not visible bazaar niamak sebi kaa yah kadam (aisa pehla) supreme court ke is aadesh ke baad uthaaya gaya he kishhara india real estate korporation(esaiaraisiel) or sahaara houseing investment korporation (esechaisiel) niveshkon ke 24,000 karod ru
 Return it
 donon companiyon ne vaikalpik rup se purna parivartaneey dibenture (oefasidi) ke madhyam se 3 karod niveshkon se yah rakam jutai he
 a Sebi spokesperson said, "the moratorium given to the investors to return the money has ended and there was no response from Sahara
" hamen supreme court ke aadesh kaa paalan karnaa hi tha
 The Sebi order is discussed in the Tardeo office only when sporadic investors come here to gain the confidence of their money being safe
 zyaadaatar kaa is samooh ke saath acha anubhav rahaa he or ve company ke agjicutive dwaara samajhane se raji hote dikhte hai
 Those who are not satisfied are told that they can withdraw their deposit if they wish
 offis main maujuud ek senior agjicutive kehete hai, ''isse hamen zyada pareshaani nahin he
 Do you see any rush at our door? We have already returned the money of the investors who wanted it
 anya niveshkon kaa paisa hamane sahaara kyuu shop kii phixd diposit skim jaisi nai yojanaon main laga diya he jisamen unhen chah saal main 2
 35 times returns have been offered
 ” kyuu shop sahaara samooh kaa nayaa retail venture he
 Three days after the SEBI order, Sahara published large advertisements in newspapers and stated that 3,663 against its debenture holders
 93 karod ru
 No more liability than samooh ke korporate communication ke pramukh abhijit sarkaar ne i-mail se bheje jawaab main bataaya, ''hamaari bakaayaa dendaree 3,663
 93 crores Rs
 se bahut kam he or isi tarah byaaj kii raashi bhi bahut kam he
 "now time - and in the cases that are going on, the Supreme Court will tell who is right, Sahara or SEBI
 lekin yah sahaara ke niamakon se bhidde ke lambey silsile kii sirf ek naveenatam kadi he
 So far the group has been passing every obstacle
 esaiaraisiel dhan jutaney ke liye 2008 main or esechaisiel 2009 main bazaar main utari thim
 Both of them had raised funds by issuing ofcds to investors under the preferential allotment rules, a valid preferential allotment for unlisted companies
 pehali company ko iske liye ijaajat uttar pradesh tathaa uttarakhand main register of companyj (aaraosi) se mili thi or duusari ko maharashtra main aaraosi se
 But in 2009, when another group company Sahara Prime City planned to launch an initial public issue (initial public offering or IPO), Sebi found several flaws in its disclosure and as per the rules it had made a statement about several other companies of Sahara Group
 Asked for information
 yah ipio bazaar main nahin aa paaya
 Perhaps Roshan Lal of Indore wrote a letter to National Housing Bank (NHB) asking if these debentures were issued by Sahara companies as per the rules
 enechabi ne is patr ko aage badhaate hue sebi ko bhej diya
 On this, SEBI asked the group for details of all those people who have been issued these debentures
 sebi ne kaha ki chunki ye oefasidi 50 se zyada niveshkon ko jari kiye gaye hai, isliye ye tarjihi aavanton nahin balki public ishyu kii shrenee main aaenge
 At the same time, a debate started over whose jurisdiction this matter would come
 pehle iske liye regulator aaraosi ko mana ja rahaa tha kyonki sebi mukhyat: share bazaar main listed companiyon ke maamle dekhtaa he
 One opinion was that privately allocated debentures issued by unlisted companies would fall under the jurisdiction of the corporate ministry
 aakhirkaar sebi ne supreme court kaa sahaara liya
 When investors did not get details, Sebi asked both the companies to refund the money
 maamla supreme court ke paas pahunchaa jisane sebi ke paksh main faisla sunaaya
 However, by the time SEBI takes action on ofcds, Sahara Group had started taking fixed deposits (fds) in the name of Sahara Credit Cooperative Society (SCCS)
 ek se zyada rajyon main sakriy is tarah kii kooparative socity kendriya krishi mantralay ke tahat sthit central register of kooparative societes ke adhikaar kshetra main aati he
 Sahara says that it should not be considered as a way of bypassing SEBI
 kooparative ke managing diarector shantnu mukherjee ne i-mail se bataaya, “essisies kaa gathan 5 march, 2010 ko hua tha, jabaki sebi ne oefasidi ke bare main sahaara samooh kii do companiyon par aapatti may, 2010 main jari kii thi
 “SCCS has run several schemes to raise funds
 ise aath saal ke epady ke tahat bechaa ja rahaa he jis par 226 fisadi se zyada ritern dene kaa vaada kiya gaya he
 The thing to note is that unlike bank fixed deposits, you cannot withdraw money before five years
 sach to yah he ki essisies kii zyaadaatar epady yojanaon main paanch saal kaa lock-in period he
 Sahara M
 benifit esaiaraisiel kii puraani sahaara real estate manthali plan kii tarah hi he
 Sahara U
 golden kai myanon main pehle ke esechaisiel ke housekshasg band ke jaisaa hi he
 According to the law, SCCS cannot collect deposits from the public, but only from its members
 lekin kai rajyon main kaam karne vaali credit kooparative socity nirantar nae sadsy bana sakati he
 Whenever a new investor invests money in a fixed deposit scheme, the membership form of the cooperative society is also filled
 taddev offis main kisi agjicutive ko essisies yojanaayen bechate dekh lenaa koi kathin nahin he
 We were also able to buy one such scheme
 kooparative is samooh ke liye aage kaa sahaara sabit ho sakati he
 Mukherjee said, "the promoters of SCCS are activists of the Sahara India Parivar
 hamane samooh se kaha ki kooparative ke naam main sahaara kaa istemaal karne diya jaae, jisaki ijaajat ek maamuli roylty ke badale di gai he
 “the cooperative's salesmen are as quick to capture the attitude as anyone in the business can be
 pichley saal unhone sone ke bhav main aane vaali teji kaa phayda uthaate hue niveshkon se yah vaayada kar jamaa rashiyaan leen ki paanch saal ke baad unhen iske badale sona (physical gold) diya jayega
 The q Shop initiative then arose
 sahaara kyuu gold mart kii gold back skim ke tahat kisi niveshak ke maujuuda 10 gram sone ke bhav ke baraabar raashi jamaa karne par use paanch saal ke baad 6 gram atirikt 22 carat physical gold dene kaa ofer diya gaya he
 But when gold prices started falling, its salesmen lost interest in selling the scheme
 pichley saal april main company ne kyuu shop ke tahat ech yojana ko aage badhaayaa
 Under this, the group paid 2 of the principal in six years
 35 guna rakam ko waapas karne kaa bharosa diya he
 Initially it had at least Rs 5,000
 kii raashi lee ja rahi thi, lekin baad main yah ghatakar sirf 1,000 ru
 She has come
 aisa nahin he ki sirf oonche byaaj kii vajah se hi niveshak is yojana ke prati aakarshith ho rahe hai
 In fact, many of its investors are daily earners, small traders and other lower middle income groups
 inamen se bahut se log aise bhi hai jinke paas kisi bank main khaataa bhi nahin he
 In such a situation, the Sahara group came forward to take advantage of the non-development of the banking system
 yah un ilaakon main pahunchaa jahaan bainkon kii shakhaaen nahin hai or jahaan bahut se logon kaa bainkon main koi khaataa bhi nahin he
 Such people spend Rs 10, 30 or 100 every day
 jamaa karte hai
 As Subrata Roy has pointed out, the group has faced closed doors many times in search of one way to raise funds from the public
 lekin hameshaa koi na koi rasta nikaal liya he
 So it is not surprising that Sahara's office looks full of expectations
 is bich sahaara ke marchent banker anaam ke adhikari jab indore main roshanalaal ke pate par pahunche, to vahaan koi nahin mila
 The Supreme Court on Wednesday gave a historic verdict on rights in the capital Delhi
 court ne alji ko sarkaar kii salaah par kaam karne ko kaha he

 If this situation persists, there will be a lot of chaos in the country
 'kejariwal ne aage kaha, 'desh kaa chota-motaa aadmi agar avmaananaa kare to dekha ja saktaa he, yahaan supreme court kii avmaananaa centre sarkaar kar rahi he
 When the Supreme Court has said that the Delhi government will have all the power except three subjects (law and order, land and police), then why is LG Sahab refusing this? ”kejriwal said,“ This stalled the Delhi government There is a conspiracy to do this which was going on for the last 3 years
 ab yah janata ke saamne he ki kaise court ke aadesh ko centre sarkaar ke pratinidhi LG manaa kar rahe hai
 Kejriwal said, "the central government and the Delhi government are opposition parties
 centre sarkaar nahin chaahegi ki dilli sarkaar acha kaam karen
 If an officer does a good job, the central government will transfer it
 centre sarkaar ne khulkar supreme court ke faisle ko maanane se inkaar kiya he

 The Supreme Court has said that the Lieutenant Governor is not free to take a decision in Delhi, LG will have to act only as per the advice of the Cabinet
 iske alaava supreme court ne saaf kar diya he ki dilli ko purna rajya kaa darja milanaa mumkin nahin he
 It is clear from the decision of the Supreme Court that the elected government of Delhi is responsible for running the state

 For the first time in the country after independence, on 4 January 2018, four judges of the same court created a press conference against the then Chief Justice of Supreme Court, Deepak Mishra
 press conference karne vaale chaar jajon main varisht jaj justise chelmeshwar bhi shaamil the
 On the platform of India Today Conclave 2019, former Supreme Court Judge Chelameswar said at a press conference of 4 judges that questioning is not rebellion
 loktantr main sawaal poochna koi virodh nahin hota
 He said that when we four judges told the country that things were not going in the right way, but today i am living like a common man
 kisi tarah kaa confrentshan ho rahaa he mujhe nahin lagata he
 He said that even when we had a press conference, it was something new
 haalanki, unhone kaha ki sirf bharat hi nahin balki duniya main bhi nyaaypalika main sankat aata rahaa he
 He said that it is not necessary to put all the judges in the same class, every judge has his own different mood
 kuch jaj aise bhi hote hai jinhen jhukaaya bhi ja saktaa he
 When i raised questions, some people said that i am running an agenda
 lekin isse mujhe koi fark nahin padataa he
 Chelameswar said that impeachment is not the solution to any problem
 colegium ke system main bhi kaaphi dikkatein hai
 The appointments being made by the court were being stopped
 rajdeep saradesai ke sawaal ki kya jaj samjhauta kar rahe hai? iske jawaab main chelmeshwar ne kaha ki yah vyakti par nirbhar karata he aap kis jaj kii baat kar rahe hai
 But i can say that there are some judges who can be bowed down
 lekin sabhi jajon ko ek hi najar se dekhnaa sahi nahin he

 com / dcmkovwjtq ayodhya main ram mandir-babari masjid vivaad ke samjhaute ke liye shiya central vakf board ne supreme court main masauda pesh kiya he
 According to the draft Shia Waqf Board, a Ram temple should be built at the disputed site and the mosque should be built in Lucknow, to be named 'masjid-e-aman'
 shiya central vakf board ke is masauda se muslim pakshakaar sahamat nahin hai
 The Muslim party said that Shia Waqf Board President Wasim Rizvi was chanting the Ram temple for personal acquittal and corruption
 shiya central vakf board ke is masauda par aajtak
 in spoke to Muslim parties
 muslim pakshakaron kaa kahana he ki supreme court kaa faisla hi adarsh faisla hoga
 Anything else other than this is baseless
 is masaude ko kanoonee manyata nahin-khaliyodhya maamle main apilkarta moulana mehfujurh rahamaan ke namit khalik ahamed khan ne kaha- ye masaude wasim rizvi kii apni raay he, jisaki koi kanoonee manyata nahin he
 The opinion of the Muslim parties, from the beginning, the decision of the Supreme Court is the solution to this issue
 khalik ne kaha ki ram mandir banaai jaae hamen koi harj nahin he, lekin wo apni jagah banaai jaae na kii babari masjid kii jagah par, jaisaa ki wasim rizvi kah rahe hai ki masjid kahin or banegi to vah babari masjid kaa riplacement nahin ho saktaa he
 Rizvi, who is chanting Ram temple for avoiding jail, - Iqbal Ansari, son of Muslim party Hasim Ansari in Iqbal Ansari Ayodhya case, said - The Shia Waqf Board and the Shia community do not agree with Wasim Rizvi's opinion
 wasim rizvi bhrashtachar ke aaropon se ghire hue hai, usase bachane ke liye ramamandir kii baat kar rahe hai
 Iqbal says Wasim Rizvi has no direct involvement in the Ayodhya case
 aise main wasim rizvi kii baaten koi ahmiyat nahin rakhti he
 Iqbal said that Wasim Rizvi is doing everything to win the heart of BJP
 unka kahana he- maamla supreme court main he or court ke jariye hi faisla hoga
 i believe that the court will decide not on the basis of faith but on facts and evidence
 nijee mufeed ke liye he ye masauda- firangi mahalimuslim personal lau board ke sadsy moulana khalid rashid firangi mahali ne kaha ki shiya vakf board ke masaude kii koi ahmiyat nahin he
 The High Court has made it clear in 1947 that the Babri Masjid is not of the Shia Waqf Board but of the Sunni Waqf Board
 firangi mahali kaa kahana he ki maamla supreme court main final daur main he
 Wasim Rizvi is creating confusion in the matter for his personal benefit
 wo supreme court main apil karta bhi nahin he or na hi usase jud sakate hai, wo sirf media main bane rahane ke liye ye sab kar rahe hai
 He said that the Muslim Personal Law Board has made it clear that whatever decision of the Supreme Court will be valid
 isse donon samudaay ke pakshakaron ko manani chahie
 After the decision of the Supreme Court, this issue will be resolved forever and the politics will always end for this issue forever

 The Indian Olympic team is once again doping
 bharottolak monica devi ko isi aarope main olympic dal se baahar rakhane kii khabar mili he
 The dope test was conducted in India 3 weeks ago in Patiala and then Bangalore in which all the players tested positive for Monica's first test
 iske baad unka naam beijing dal se hataa diya gaya
 It is feared that Monica has used the banned drug Nandralone
 monica ko 69 kigra varg main shirkat kerani thi
 Monica had hoped to win a medal in the Olympics by winning one silver and two bronze medals at the Asian Championships, which has now been restored
 khabar ye bhi he ki olympic team ke do or sadsy bhi doping test main fail ho gaye hai or jald hi unke naamon kaa khulaasa kiya jayega
 This is not the first time India has been embarrassed by weightlifters getting caught in the dope test at the Olympics, in 2004 also Pratibha Rani and Sanamacha Chano were convicted of doping

 sansad na sahi sadak se hi shuukravaar ko congress ne modi sarkaar ke khilaaf virodh kaa aisa bigul foonka he, jisamen muddon ke saath bhaawanaaon kaa bhi ghol he
 After losing the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the Congress, which has become almost stable, has been preparing to surround Parliament by road for a long time
 yahi kaaran he ki party alaakaman se lekar varisht netaa or kaaryakarta har kisi main 'loktantr bachaao' march ek urja kaa sanchaar karata bhi dikh rahaa he
 1) Congress President Sonia Gandhi, in her address at Jantar Mantar, said in a clear, unambiguous terms to infuse new energy into the party that the Congress will never back down from any sacrifice to play the role of a strong opposition
 2) congress shasit rajyon main sarkaar bachaane kii kavayad ho yaa sansad main deshhit ke mudde, congress modi sarkaar ke aage thodi kamjor dikhi he
 But the way 83-year-old former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, along with Sonia and Rahul, held the mic at Jantar Mantar on Friday, it is a direct sign to the workers that the party is no longer in a quiet position
 3) loktantr bachaao march is myne main bhi khaas he ki lambey samay baad sadak par party ne badi sankhya main kaaryakartaaon ko ekajute kiya
 He had direct contact with top leaders and there were some indications that on the issues, everyone from the top leadership to the bottom would walk step by step
 4) sansad main bajet satr kii kaarywahi chal rahi he
 In such a situation, trying to pressurize the center from inside as well as outside can work
 5) loktantr bachaao march kii aguwai rahul gandhi ne kii, vahiin jantar-mantar par congress ke postaron main robert wadra bhi dikhe
 Whereas till now, the party has been keeping Vadra away from the exercise of politics
 aise main nae kayaas lagane shuru ho gaye he or yuva kandhon par jimmedaari kii sugabugahat aane lagi he

 The song of Suhana Saeed is also getting a lot of praise from the judges of the show
 duniyabar se suhana ke gane ko tarif mil rahi he
 Arjun Janya, a judge and music director of the reality show, says that Suhana's lyricism is setting an example of unity
 unke gane se ye pataa chalata he ki kaise puri duniya main sangeet ke jariye dharmik sauhaard or shanti sthapit kii ja sakati he
 Apart from praise and congratulations, Suhana is also being targeted for her songwriting
 mangalore muslims naam ke ek fasebuk pejpar unke gane ko samudaay kaa apmaan bataaya gaya he
 One of his opponents has written on the page that he has tarnished the Muslim community by singing in front of men
 soshal media par suhana ke samarthan main bhi kai log utar chuke hai
 His supporters are preparing to take legal action against those who targeted Absuhana
 haalanki soshal media par nishaanaa banaae jane ke baad suhana se sampark nahin kiya ja sakaa he
 Those who support Suhana say that some people are working to spread hatred among communities through it
 mujhe ai naa jag se laajamain itnaa jor se naachi aaj,ke ghunghru tut gaekitne fankaaron ne is geet ko apni aawaaj di hogi, kahana mushkil he
 But it is important to remember its author Qatil Shifai on his death anniversary

 In honor of his master Hakim Muhammad Shifa, he added the word Shifai to his name
 katil pyaar ke sachche shaayar the
 Tired i remember doing you, i want to remember you
 
 
 ***hamen bhi neend aa jaaegi ham bhi so hi jaayengbhi kuch be-qaraari he sitaaro tum to so jaao
 
 
 Don't know what Katil wrote
 kitna khub likhaa
 His songs, ghazals and poetry are still chanted
 shaayari kii duniya main unka ek khaasaa mukaam he
 It is said that due to the untimely demise of the father, he had to leave his studies in between and start his own sporting goods store
 is dhandhe main buree tarah naakaam rahane ke baad qatil rawalpindi chale gaye, or ek transport company main saath rupye maheene kii tankhwaah par kaam karnaa shuru kar diya
 Qatil's first ghazal appeared in the weekly newspaper 'star' originating from Lahore, whose editor was Qamar Jalalabadi
 ek baar likhnaa kya shuru kiya, katil ne kitne shandaar nagamen likhe
 Whenever it comes, Mira name goes with the third name, why do people burn with the name Mira *** You ask and i do not tell you, there is no such situation, a little heart is broken and there is no problem *** Fill my heart with pain Or may Allah bless you or Allah, when will the moon stars ask you to see the heart without fear or Allah

 mumbai hamale kaa mastermind or bharat kaa most wonted aatanki hafiz mohammad said ab salaakhon ke peeche pahunch gaya he
 But it is yet to be accounted
 padosi mulk pakistan main baithkar hafiz said ne bharat ke khilaaf kai aatanki vaardaaton ko anjaam diya he
 Actually, Hafiz is a big enemy of India, which India's intelligence and security agencies have been trying to capture for many years
 bharat ne paak ko uske khilaaf pukhta saboot bhi die hai, lekin paak keval hafiz par karrwai kaa dikhaava karata rahaa
 In 2008, the United Nations banned jamaat-ud-dawa and lashkar-e-taiba, the organizations of this terrorist who carried out many major incidents in India
 pakistan sarkaar ne kai baar dabaav main aakar use giraftaar to kiya lekin har baar vah adaalat ke sahare chhootakar baahar aa gaya
 On 25 August 2009, a red corner notice was issued by Interpol against India's request
 baavjood iske vah abhi tak pakistan main khuleam gum rahaa tha
 He often spewed venom against India at public events
 mumbai main 26-11 ke aatanki hamale ke mastermind hafiz said ke khilaaf exiaar darj hui thi
 But nothing happened
 wo itnaa shaatir he ki jab lashkar-e-taiyaba par pabandi lagi to isane jamaat-ud-daawa ke naam se nayaa aatankwaadi sanghathan banaaya
 The arrest of Hafiz Saeed is a show of Pakistan
 isse pehle bhi paak sarkaar ne aisa drama kiya he- ujjwal nikamahafiz said ke khilaaf pakistan main aatankwaad failaane ke liye paise kaa istemaal karne kaa maamla darj he
 Due to this, the Lahore Police started investigating every hideout, including Hafiz Saeed's house and madrasa
 or isi ke baad teror funding ke maamle main hafiz said ko lahore se giraftaar kar liya gaya
 The Pakistani army and government are aware of the vein of Hafiz
 lekin jab antarrashtriya dabaav ke baad pakistan ne jamaat-ud-daawa, lashkar-e-taiyaba or falaah-e-insaaniyat ke khilaaf jaanch shuru kii or us par teror funding, mani londring ke aarope tay kiye, tab hafiz said ne in aaropon ko lahore ucch nyaayalay main chunauti de daali
 On this, the Lahore High Court issued a notice to the Pakistani government, the Punjab government and the counter-terrorism Department
 bataa den ki punjab police ke counter terarism department ne jamaat-ud-daawa ke 13 netaaon ke khilaaf 23 exiaar darj kii thi
 They are alleged to have provided funds to increase terrorism in different cities of Punjab province of Pakistan
 lekin ab hafiz kii giraftaar ke saath hi ye tay ho gaya he ki pakistan dabaav main he or hafiz ke khilaaf karrwai karnaa uski majaburi ban gaya he
 It remains to be seen what action the Pak government will take against him now
 udhar, varisht adhivaktaa ujjwal nikam ne aatanki hafiz said kii giraftaar par pratikriya dete hue kaha ki yah sab pakistan kaa dikhaava he
 Even before this, the Pak government did many dramas to take him into custody, he was also put under house arrest
 lekin aakhirkaar wo har baar chhootakar baahar aa jaataa he

 do saal ke intjaar ke baad khulaasa ho hi gaya ki katappa ne bahubali ko kyon maaraa
 However, the audience waited for two years to know this question
 or jo bhi ab tak ye jaan chuke honge, unke aage ab ek or bada sawaal aa gaya he
 The question is- will 'bahubali 3' also come? Will the third part also come and when will it come? Actually, there are many such things in the film, then it indicates that the next part of this franchise can also be made
 phir bahubali 2 ko lekar hue tamaam intervyuuj main khud diarector rajamauli ne kabhi sidhe taur par inkaar nahin kiya ki bahubali 3 ko lekar koi planning nahin he
 Bahubali 3 will be confirmed, at least these 5 proofs definitely point out
 
 
 saboot number 1-bahubali 2kaa aakhri dialog kuch kahata hafilm dekh chuke hai to aap samaj jaaenge or dekhne ja rahe hai to dhyaan dijiega jab mahishmati ke singhaasana par baithne ke baad mahendra bahubali ne vaada kiya- meraa vachan hi he shashan
 Proof number 2- The monk told Shiva's wish, apart from casting it in the end, stay for some time
 ek bachche kii aawaaj main sawaal uthegaa ki kya iske baad mahishmati par shashan kisne kiya
 
 
 Did Mahendra Bahubali and his children rule
 is par bahubali vaale sanyasi kii aawaaj main jawaab aata he - shiv kii marji main kya jaanu
 
 
 Now, given the hype and craze of the film, there is every chance that the film makers will want to bet on its next part too
 phir bhale hi unako dobaaraa do saal kaa time bahubali ko parde par laane main lage!hit hue bahubali prabhas, in bollywood actors ko ho saktaa he khatrasboot number 3- jinda he bhallaal dev ke papa, or katappaabahubali 2 mechant bhallav dev kii maut se hua or bijjaldev kaa kirdaar jivit he
 Though he joined Mahendra Bahubali's Rajatilak, but after watching Bahubali and Bahubali 2, it was understood that he is not a quiet character
 or katappa ke kirdaar main abhi itnaa dam he ki use bahubali 3 main bhi piroyaa jaae
 What is known about Katappa's past in this film! How expensive are Bahubali 2 tickets being sold
 
 
 saboot number 4-bahubali 3 main hogi mahendra va avantika kii shaadi?bahubali main mahendra bahubali kii premika ke kirdaar main dikhin tamanna bhatiya yani avantika kii bas jhalak bhar he
 If his fans blinked, he might not be able to see their presence
 aise main ummid kii ja rahi he ki bahubali ke agle part main donon kaa milan kara diya jaae
 Mahendra may have met his mother Devasena in Bahubali 2, but his meeting with girlfriend Avantika is still incomplete
 yani bahubali 3 kaa puraa scope he
 Proof No
 4 - Hollywood can be the first part of the follow-up to the franchise or second, the film competes with many of Hollywood's big projects in technical prowess
 aise main puure chance hai ki ise agali kadiyon main badhaayaa jaae
 Just as numbers are attached to the names of films abroad - like movies like Fast and Furious, 300
 haalanki bollywood main is tarah kaa trend chalan main or kai filmon ko naam phayda bhi bijness main mila he
 Apart from this, market makers like Karan Johar would definitely like to take forward the set name of Bahubali
 'bahubali kii maa' ke bare main ye baaten kya jaanate hai aap
 
 
 Proof Number 5: Rajamouli has also maintained that in all the promotional events related to Suspense Baahubali 2, Rajamouli got a question in front of whether Bahubali 3 will be made
 isko lekar unhone kuch spasht nahin kaha
 By the way, he confessed that he will first make a web series about Bahubali
 iske baad aage kii planning hogi
 Let me tell you that after watching Bahubali 2, it is understood that some scenes of the second part have been shot along with the first part
 aise main mahishmati ke jaise set dikh rahe hai, use dekhakar lagata he ki bahubali 3 kii ghoshnaa ke liye hamen taiyaar rahanaa chahie

 After several rejection and objections by a section of students and teachers, jnu's proposal to introduce a short-term course in yoga was finally approved by the university's apex council
 vishvavidhyalay ke ek varisht adhikari ne kaha, is babat guuruuvaar ko academik parishad kii baithak main faisla liya gaya
 There has been a lot of debate on this course and now approving it, celebrating Yoga Day (june 21) would be a very good idea
 bhartiya samskruti tathaa yoga par laghu avadhi ke teen paathyakram shuru karne kaa vichaar sabase pehle varsh 2015 main aayaa tha

 The IPL match of absurd religious statements is going on in the country
 yah jaanaleva bhi hota ja rahaa he
 At the same time, people all over the world are trying to understand how long the price of crude oil will fall and if we keep falling, then how long will we be stable
 2009 ke baad pehali baar duniya ke bazaar main kachche tel kii keemat 50 dollar prati bairal se neeche aa gai he, chah maheenaa pehle june 2014 main isaki keemat 115 dollar prati bairal thi
 The United States and China topped the world in terms of oil consumption
 china kii arthvyavastha kii raftaar slo ho gai he
 America is taking millions of barrels of oil less from OPEC countries like Saudi Arabia
 usne apane yahaan tel kaa utpaadan badha diya he
 The production of oil from between the stones has increased, which you call shale oil
 iske baad bhi tel utpaadak deshon ne tel kaa utpaadan kam nahin kiya he
 Now this is not a crisis in Saudi Arabia because it has enough money but other countries which are dependent only on oil exports have collapsed
 rus, venezuela, nigeria, libya, iran, iraq jaise mulkon main sankat aa gaya he
 Europe is already in a recession-like condition
 to tel kii maang vahaan se bhi nahin hai
 So much money is earned from oil that the same money is used in different businesses in the name of petro dollars
 videshi nivesh kii shakl main
 Obviously, when there is no money from oil, then there will be less money to invest in different countries or businesses of the world
 jab videshi nivesh nahin aayega tab vikaas babu kaa kya hoga
 But why were the prices of crude oil touching the sky till six months ago
 daam kyon chadh rahe the
 For this, you have to understand the game of futures trading
 maang to tab bhi itani hi rahi hogi lekin bhavishya main badhane ke naam par log paisa lagaate gaye jaise niveshak praparty main laga dete hai or ek din pate hai ki jo flats kharida he uskaa daam hi nahin bad rahaa to flats bech kar duusare sector kii taraf chal dete hai yaa nayaa nivesh nahin karte hai
 It is not enough for everyone to understand this game of finance capital
 in satorion ko jab laga ki maang to he nahin to kyon na paisa nikaal kar waapas america le jaaya jaae
 They started buying bonds in America
 isse dollar kaa daam phir badhane laga or uske mukaable baaki mudraaen kamazor hone lageen
 The euro had not weakened so much in the last nine years
 june main dollar ke mukaable rupee kii keemat 60 rupee thi, lekin chah maheene baad 63 rupee 24 paise ho gai he
 We are still far away from the 1947 rate
 jab pradhanmantri modi kaha karte the ki 1947 main ek rupaya ek dollar ke baraabar hua karata tha
 You are happy to see news of petrol being cheaper on the channel, but is the government equally happy
 agar chunaav na ho to wo is khushi kaa izhaar bhi na karen
 Still why the Indian government increased excise duty on oil companies
 agar nahin badhaati to companiyaan aapke liye petrol deazal ke daam or bhi kam kar saktin thim
 When crude oil was at $ 115 per barrel in June 2014, petrol was getting close to Rs 71 per liter in Delhi
 june se janvari ke bich kaccha tel 65 dollar prati bairal kam ho gaya, lekin dilli main petrol ke daam main sirf nau rupee kii kami ai
 So did it happen as cheap as it should
 inke daamon par sarkaar kaa niyantran nahin he to bazaar ke hisaab se ye kam kyon nahin hai
 Then what happens to the government's earnings, from which it raises money for development
 kaccha tel se sirf petrol deazal or mitti tel hi nahin banataa he
 Crude oil is used in many products like tires, rubber, textiles, medicines, perfumes, inks, hair color, candles, shoes, plastic toothpaste
 zaahir he sarkaar kii kamai kaaphi kam ho sakati he
 The same crisis was during Manmohan Singh and this is also in front of Modi
 mahangaai badhati he to bhi bajet ghaataa badhata he kam hoti he to bhi bad rahaa he
 If you remember the model of economy available before us, you will find that it is more of a crisis period
 swarna yug kabhi kabhaar
 That too does not last a golden age in any one country
 kabhi yahaan to kabhi vahaan
 There is a crisis even in those countries where the digital revolution has come
 lekin maujuuda sankat ko kya sirf tel ke girte daamon se hi samajha ja saktaa he
 Prices of food products and commodities have also fallen worldwide
 iskaa matlab to yah hua ki logon ke paas in chizon ko kharidne ke liye paise nahin hai
 Most people remained poor even on good days
 duniyabar main khaadya, dhaatu, kapaas rabar ke daam girane se gujarat ke kapaas or moongfalee kisaan sadak par aae din pradarshan kar rahe hai
 The MNREGA has been cutting since the time of the previous and new government
 iske alaava nai sarkaar ne anaaj ke nunatam samarthan mulya main bhi kam vruddhi kii he
 Some economists are praising that this has led to less money for the farmers, due to which inflation has come down
 itane saare udhaaharan isliye de rahaa hum taaki aap is chakra ko samaj saken
 Economists are bombarded that the salaries of ceos and managers are going to increase, but they are also upset that the wages of farmers and agricultural laborers in villages are increasing less
 ye koun sa science he aap behatar jaanate honge
 But the Hindu Muslim is tuffed with the topic
 buudhvaar ke indian express main chapa he ki kisaanon kii aamadani pichley das saal main sabase kam badi he
 This model of the economy is strange
 jab giravat aati he tab log ummid paal lete hai or jab badhat hoti he to ummiden unako paal leti he
 So the fall in the price of crude oil is Bumlhari for India or is cold

 Today i am feeling very good, because the bill of reservation is being passed in the Lok Sabha
 isliye 2019 main majboot ho rahi he narendra modi ji kii hill, kyonki rafel main nahin hua he bilkul galat deal
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi ji is very clever, so the bill has come in Parliament for upper caste reservation and three divorces
 narendra modiji ne dikhaai he ek nai jhalak, ab mat dikhaao rahul gandhi ji galat-galat
 Narendra Modi ji had good traits, so the upper castes are getting reservation
 rahul gandhi nahin, narendra modi ji kar rahe hai desh kaa rakshan, 2019 main congress kaa ho jayega bhakshan
 Rahul ji, don't play wrong with Modi ji, otherwise it will be bad in 2019 '
 haalanki, ramdaas athavle ke is bhaashan ke baad sadan main thahaake lagane lage or bijepi ke saansadon ne taaliyaan bhi bajaain
 But Kumar Vishwas did not like this rhyme of Ramdas Athawale and he felt himself deceived by this poem of Ramdas Athawale
 unhone apane fasebuk par likhaa- ‪loktantr kii jis sansadeey shaktipeeth main, kabhi rashtrakavi maithilisharan gupt, ramdharisingh dinakar, balakavi bairangi or udaipratap ji jaise kaviyon ne bhashaa or kavita kaa gun-gaurav gunjaaya tha, vahaan kaa haalia 'utkarsh' aap sab 'matadaataaon' kii seva main prastut he! aise 'halke-phulke' loktantr kii jai ho
 In the parliamentary powerhouse of democracy, poets like Rashtrakavi Maithili Sharan Gupt, Ramdhari Singh Dinkar, Balkavi Bairagi and Udayapratap ji, the glory of language and poetry, the recent "utkarsh" is presented in the service of all you voters

 Athawale once again targeted the opposition parties by presenting a special rhyme
 savarnon ko aarakshan dene kii narendra modi ji ne dikhaai he himmat, isliye 2019 main badhegi unki keemat
 The poverty line even among the upper castes, Narendra Modi ji saw it
 or 10% aarakshan dene kaa le liya mauka, lekin 70 saal tak congress ne diya tha savarnon ko dhokhaa
 Narendra Modi ji's caravan moved forward, so it is good for the poor upper castes
 narendra modi ji ke saath dosti karne kii mere paas he kala, isliye congress ko chhodkar main bijepi kii taraf chalaa
 Modi ji has hit six by giving reservation to upper castes, so his victory in 2019 is certain agar modi ji or shah ji mujhe de denge thodaa dhakka, to main congress ke khilaaf maar duungaa chakka
