 However, we will be able to receive the call for some time
 lekin jab sim band yani free colling kaa sawaal hi nahin uthta

 The special habit of Jharkhand Chief Minister Arjun Munda is that he not only listens seriously to any better suggestion, but he also gets that suggestion noted
 2010 main jab ve mukhyamantri bane the to ek cultural program ke dauraan kisi ne unase kaha ki jab ve khud acchhee filmon ke shaukeen hai or to jharkhand main film industry kii sambhaavnaaon ko talashne ke liye kuch karte kyon nahin
 Munda may not remember the name and face of the man, but that thought settled in his mind
 agast main munda ne jharkhand ke aalaa afasaron ko bulaakar apni manshaa saaf kar di ki ve hindi film ke 100 saal puraa hone ke maukey par jharkhand main film mahotsav kaa aayojan chaahate hai
 They had already outlined the program before placing this proposal
 11 se 15 sitambar tak ranchi main chale film mahotsav 'suhana safar' main jharkhand se lekar desh kii kuch badi filmi hastiyon ne shirkat kii
 Which included state documentary filmmaker Meghnath to Pinjar director Chandra Prakash Dwivedi and Jab We Met director Imtiaz Ali
 paanch din ke is program main 21 filmein dikhaai gayi, jisamen madar india, pyaasa, guide, chokher bali jaisi nami filmein bhi shaamil thim
 The special feature of the festival was Munda's announcement in which he announced to build an outdoor studio on the lines of Film City in Jharkhand
 unhone kaha ki jharkhand sarkaar ek film niti laaegi or jald hi film deveopment korporation board kaa nirmaan hoga
 Those who had just heard about Munda's announcement told them that the state government had started working on it
 sarkaar ne patratu main takreeban 11 acre jameen kii pahchaan kii he
 Munda said, "we will soon make studios to promote the film industry in Jharkhand
" film niti ke saath-saath film deveopment korporation board kaa bhi gathan hoga
 The people of Jharkhand are collecting their coinage in the film industry
 yahi samay he jab sthaneey pratibha ko ubharne kaa mauka, maahaul or suvidha mili
 On the lines of Kolkata and Hyderabad, Jharkhand also wants to make its presence in the film industry in the name of Hollywood
 santhali, nagpuri or khortha bhashaa main gane ke album to khub nikalate hai lekin filmein adhik nahin ban paati hai
 The film industry in Jharkhand lags far behind that of other states
 mahotsav ke dauraan santhali filmon ke diarector dasarath hansda ne kaha ki yah ghoshnaa ek shubh sanket he
 He says, "so far we have been making films with passion and passion
 agar rajya sarkaar madad detii he to hamaara kaam aasaan ho jayega
 Jharkhand has a better landscape and locations in terms of filming
 maowad or kanoon-vyavastha bade kaaran hai jo film banane waalon ko yahaan aane se rokte hai
 Chandra Prakash Dwivedi says, "I would like to shoot my next film in Jharkhand
 yahaan behatar lokation hai
 If the state government gives assurance of security then people will come here
 ''munda khud bhi is chunauti ko achche se jaanate hai
 He says, "jharkhand government will provide better support along with security
 '' jahaan film mahotsav ne sthaneey kalakaaron or nirmaataaon ko apni pratibha dikhaane kaa mauka diya to rajya sarkaar kii ghoshnaa ne sthaneey film jagat ke logon ke man main ummiido kii nai lahar paidaa kar di he

 The story of the falling rupee against the dollar is not new anymore
 1 dollar kii keemat 71 rupye ke paar nikal gai he
 Experts who read the markets (stocks, commodities, currencies) on technical charts are anticipating further decline this fall
 maujuuda str se rupye kii tikhi giravat ke parinaam gambhir ho sakate hai
 Significantly, from the beginning of the year till date, the rupee 10 against the dollar
 50 fisadi se zyada kamjor ho chukaa he
 "the rupee has broken the five-year mark on the technical chart," says Amit Hachrekar, director of Index Genius Investment Advisors
 yani paanch saal tak ek bade daayre main ghoomane ke baad usase baahar nikalnaa
 In technical parlance it is called longterm technical breakout
 aise brake out ke baad badi chaal kii sambhaavna banati he
 The major stock market Nifty broke a five-year break out in 2014
 (nifti or rupye donon ke brakeout chart neeche dekhen) uske baad se ab tak 86 fisadi kii teji nifti main dekhne ko mil chuki he
 "if the rupee also follows a similar pattern, then the estimate of the price of 1 dollar is enough to make the economists sweat
 haalanki bazaar main abhi visheshgy kisi bahut badi giravat kii ashanka nahin jataa rahe hai or 73
 The next level of 50 is the key support (support level) value

 *** hollywood film godfadar ko duniya kii sabase clasik filmon main shumaar kiya jaataa he
 The film, which came out in 1972, has been declared a benchmark in many ways by many great directors, cinephiles, critics and cinematic pundits
 haalanki chanki pandey kii beti or actress ananyaa pandey ko aisa nahin lagata he
 Ananya Pandey recently called the film overrated in an interview with Pinkvilla
 matlab unhen lagata he ki ye film zyada acchhee nahin he or ise bevajaah itnaa hip mila hua he
 There is no doubt that people can have a different opinion about any film, no matter how good it is
 aisa hi kuch dekhne main aayaa tha jab orsen wales kii masterpis film citijan ken ko hollywood ke mashhoor tivi sho frends par boring bataaya gaya tha or iske baad is sho ko kaaphi trol bhi kiya gaya tha
 View this post on Instagramhappy Raksha Bandhan Ahaani ❤️ we l xxrep 7 u v u 🥰 (swipe to see how much he loves us back 🤪) People got angry on social media because they made it clear that they had not even seen this film
 ananyaa ne kaha ki unhone ye film isliye nahin dekhi he kyonki ye overrated he
 Due to this, she started getting trolled on Twitter
 ananyaa ke bare main ek shaks ne likhaa ki "ananyaa pandey ko lagata he ki godfadar overrated he
 Chunky Pandey should apologize for his daughter's talk to the world
 "vahiin ek shaks ne likhaa, "agar kisi actor ko lagata he ki godfadar ek overrated film he to use acting chhodkar mental aspataal join kar lenaa chahie
 "there was a person saying," Chunky Pandey is not overrated, but Godfather, because he has not yet seen him acting
 "workfrant kii baat karen to ananyaa pandey apni film pati, patni or wo ko lekar surkhiyon main hai

 The explosion occurred in the Washes district of Baghdad
 uri hamale ke baad bane halaat ko dekhte hue sarkaar par pakistan ke khilaaf karrwai ke liye lagaataar dabaav bana hua he
 Due to this pressure, the government is considering receiving Indus water treaty with Pakistan
 jal sansaadhan mantralay isko lekar mantralay main kai daur kii baithken bhi ho chuki hai
 The ministry will take a decision after reviewing the water treaty signed with Sepakistan
 bharat yah maanata he ki jab yah samjhauta kiya gaya tha ki bharat ke hiton ko us time dhyaan main nahin rakhaa gaya
 Therefore, it has become necessary to review it now
 isi ko dhyaan main rakhte hue jal sansaadhan mantralay ne is samjhaute ko rivyuu karne ke liye kai baithken kii he
 India believes that India's rights regarding water have been ignored and will be rectified
 uri ke hamale ke baad se yah maang ek baar phir tej ho gai he ki bharat ko pakistan jane vaali sindhu ilaake kii nadiyon kaa pani roak dena chahie
 It was signed on 19 September 1960 by Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and President of Pakistan General Ayub Khan
 iske tahat bharat, pakistan ko apane ilaake se hote hue jane vaali sindhu, jhelum or chenab nadiyon kaa 80 fisadi pani detaa he
 India is allowed to use only 20 percent of the water of these rivers
 is bich jammu kashmir ke up-mukhyamantri nirmal singh ne bhi sindhu jal samjhauta ko rivyuu karne kii maang kii he
 He says that the people of Jammu and Kashmir also believe that the deal has caused damage
 idhar jal sansaadhan mantralay ne bhi is samjhaute ko lekar kai daur kii baithak kii he
 The government believes that when this agreement was reached in 1907, the public interest of the country was ignored
 jammu kashmir ke up mukhyamantri nirmal singh kaa kahana he pakistan ke khilaaf thos karrwai kerani chahie jis dhang se pakistan paagalpan kar rahaa he is baar jarur hogi centre sarkaar jo bhi kadam uthaane ko uthaa rahi he or jarurat padane par or bhi uthaaegi sindhu jal samjhaute ke bare main nirmal singh kaa kahana he ki jammu kashmir ke log yahi maanate hai ki is ko rivyuu kiya janaa chahie is par karrwai honi chahie nirmal singh kaa kahana he ki sindhu jal samjhauta se jammu kashmir kaa nuksaan hua he yahi vahaan kii janata maanati he
 With this agreement, the question now arises that how can India provide more water to a neighbor like Pakistan
 aamtaur par aise samjhauton main 50-50 kaa bantwaaraa hota he
 But the then Prime Minister of India Jawaharlal Nehru signed the agreement to give 80 percent water to Pakistan by going to Karachi himself
 visheshgyon kaa maananaa he ki is samjhaute kii vajah se puure jammu-kashmir mempanbizli pariyojnaayenlgana mushkil he, jo pariyojnaayen abhi chal rahi hai unamem bhi pani ko rokkar dam nahin banaaya ja sakaa he
 If India could also use the water of these rivers, it would bring prosperity to the whole of Jammu and Kashmir and surrounding states
 agar in par bijlighar banate to hajaaron megawatt bijli paidaa kii ja sakati thi, jisase puure desh kaa phayda hota
 Experts also believe that India can propose to re-negotiate the Indus Water Agreement if it wants to
 samay or halaat ke hisaab se duniya ke kai desh aise kadam uthaate rahe hai
 On Friday, the demand for water has increased manifold due to the increasing population in Jammu and Kashmir
 agar yah pani rajya ke kaam aae to isse vahaan adhik bijli paidaa hogi, kheti kaa vikaas hoga or rojgaar ke nae maukey paidaa hoga
 Experts also believe that a large part of the water of the three eastern rivers Sutlej, Beas and Ravi of the Indus region is still going to Pakistan
 jabaki sandhi ke tahat in choti nadiyon kaa pani pakistan ko dena jaruri nahin he
 India can stop all the water of these rivers by making a dam easily
 abhi yahaan indira gandhi canal, satluj-yamuna link nahar or thian dam jaisi pariyojnaayen chal rahi hai
 It is necessary that all these projects be completed as soon as possible so that all the water can be useful for our country
 inds water treety ko khatm karne ke ke liye sarkaar par dabaav ban rahaa he ki pradhanmantri narendra narendra modi ko yah terity khatm kar deni chahie taaki pakistan ko sabak sikhaaya ja sake

 Monsoon situation has improved
 When asked about the monsoon, Ahluwalia said that the monsoon situation has improved
 kuch kam barish hui he, lekin pehle sthiti zyada kharaab thi
 The monsoon is not over yet
 meraa maananaa he ki hamen intjaar karnaa chahie or puure july maah kii sthiti ko dekhnaa chahie

 It is true that there is a problem so far, but the exact situation will be realized only when we know how little rain has fallen
 agar barish 5 se 10 pratishat tak kam rahati he to iskaa zyada prabhaav nahin padegaa
 On the question of increase in prices of food items and other items, Ahluwalia said that although inflation is going negative, many items have become expensive despite this

 With the help of the fire brigade and the Mumbai police, the film producer was evicted from the house
 police ne naukar ko varsova se giraftaar kar liya he
 The incident is from Goregaon in Mumbai
 yahaan ke 'da best sanmaan' sosayadi main rahane vaale bhojpuri film ke jane-maane produsar sanjay kumaar singh beeti raat apane ghar kuch paise lekar aae
 Asked the servant to keep the bag full of money indoors
 naukar ne apane maalik kii baat maanate hue rupee almaari main rakh die
 But the servant got a bad eye on that amount
 rupee rakhane ke baad naukar maalik ke sone kaa intjaar karne laga
 As the night progressed, the servant was sleeping
 raat ke kareeb 3 baje naukar ne maalik ke kamare main jaakar dekha, to sanjay singh so gaye the
 After that the servant Deepak Kumar locked the door of his room and then escaped by closing the door of the house, along with 4 lakhs of cash kept in the cupboard, covering the rest of the house
 duusare din subah kareeb 8 baje film produsar kii neend khuli, to unhone dekha ki bina kisi produsar-diarector kii unki 'film' ban chuki he
 From his room to the door, all were locked and the servant was absconding
 is ghatana ke baad produsar ne police ko phone kiya, jiske baad police or fire brigade ne milakar ghar kaa band darwaja kholkar unhen baahar niklaa
 According to PSI Anil Haadal of Goregaon Police, the police started searching for the accused servant who committed the theft after filing the report
 police ne kadi mashkkat ke baad aaropee naukar deepak ko andheri ke varsova se rupee or saamaan ke saath giraftaar kar liya
 During interrogation, he confessed to stealing
 dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne ravivaar ko rashtriya rajdhani main yamuna nadi par bahupratikshit signechar brij kaa udghaatan kiya
 Many other AAP leaders, including Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia, were present during this period
 udghaatan samaaroh ke bich sisodiya ne bhartiya janata party par jamkar hamalaa bolaa
 In the middle of his speech, Sisodia said that if Modi's government had got an inch of support, i would have raised slogans not of Kejriwal but modi-modi
 signechar brij ke nirmaan main hui letlatifi par baat karte hue unhone kaha ki brij kaa 2004 se 2008 tak kaam nahin hua
 After this, no work was done on this till February 2010
 sisodiya ke mutabik iske baad 459 karod kaa pul 2010 main 1131 karod kii laagat kaa ho gaya
 Its work started in March 2010, then it took 2 years to give a No Objection Certificate to the Forest Department
 jiske baad 2012 main iskaa kaam shuru hua
 After that the black stone became difficult, it took 350 crores more to remove that black rock
 unhone kaha ki pathar hataane ke liye korea se special mashin laai gai
 Even then, the file kept circulating among the officials after the government came in February 2015
 adhikari file par signechar kaa dher taiyaar karte the
 There was a conspiracy between Modi ji and BJP to stop the work of signature bridge
 isi dauraan sisodiya ne kaha ki agar modi sarkaar kaa 1 inch kaa saath miltaa to main kejariwal chhodkar modi- modi ke naare lagaataa
 The Deputy Chief Minister said that officials were threatened with the construction of the bridge
 signechar brij ke udghaatan ko lekar aam aadmi party or bhartiya janata party ke bich sangram dekhne ko mila
 Before the inauguration ceremony, BJP leader Manoj Tiwari reached there with party supporters and clashed with the Delhi Police
 tiwari or unke samarthak isko lekar kaarykram sthal par pahunche the ki unhen uske liye nahin aamantrit kiya gaya jabaki vah kshetra se saansad hai
 Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia were not present when this protest took place
 iske baad maukey par pahunche sisodiya ne kaha, 'manoj tiwari tak meri aawaaj pahunch rahi hogi, ham bijepi parshadon ko tak udghaatan main bulaate the
 You make sky walk with Delhi government money and do politics of inauguration
 aap is laayak nahin ki udghaatan main bulaayaa jaae
 If you have the courage then stop
 'darasal, isse pehle tiwari ne udghaatan kaarykram main nahin bulaaye jane ko lekar aprasannataa jataai thi or yah kehete hue kejariwal sarkaar par nishaanaa saadhaa tha ki vah mukhyamantri kaa swaagat karne ke liye kaarykram sthal par maujuud rahenge jo ravivaar ko pul kaa udghaatan karne vaale hai
 The bridge will be opened to the general public on Monday
 War Box Office Collection Day 4: bollywood ke diggaj actor ruthik roshan (hrithik Roshan) or tiger shroff (tiger Shroff) kii film 'war' (war) ne ravivaar ko cinemahol main dhooma machaakar rakh di he
 Last Sunday's strong performance of 'war' has beaten the big films of the year
 box offis india kii website ke mutabik ruthik roshan (hrithik Roshan) or tiger shroff (tiger Shroff) kii 'war' (war) ne beete 6 oktober ko 36 karod rupee kii kamai kii he
 In this sense, the film has collected Rs 158 crore in just five days
 pehle weekend par hi 158 karod rupee kaa aankada paar karne vaali 'war' ne 'bharat' kaa record bhi tod diya he
 Because Salman Khan's film 'bharat' collected only Rs 140 crore in five days
 box offis india kii website ke anusaar film ko dashahra par ek adwantage mil saktaa he, jisase film apana yah collection or bhi badha sakati he
 'war' (hindi) released on the first day 51 on the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti
 60 karod, duusare din 23
 10 crores, 21 on the third day
 30 or chauthe din 27
 60 crores
 film kii is raftaar ko dekhte hue kaha ja saktaa he ki yah jald hi 200 karod kaa aankada bhi paar kar legi
 The film received a good response from critics as well as audiences
 khaskar soshal media par 'war' ko lekar kaaphi craij dekhne ko mila
 Let me tell you that the story of the movie 'war' is from 'kabir' Hrithik Roshan and 'khalid' Tiger Shroff
 film main halaat kuch aise banate hai ki guru or shishy ek duusare se takaraane ko majaboor ho jate hai
 The disciple Khalid is used to tighten the uncontrollable guru, and then begins a tremendous action
 bike, car, helicopter, barf pahaad har jagah ection dekhne ko miltaa he
 Many tremendous twists have also been inserted in the story and the ending of the film has also been kept a bit surprising
 in sabase itar darshakon ko war (war) main bharpoor maatra main acshan or stants dekhne ko milegaa
 Ramshankar Katherian, Chairman of the SC Commission, has given a statement on the Bharat Bandh called by the upper castes in protest against the SC / ST Act
 unhone kaha ki jo andolan kiya ja rahaa he wo raajnneeti se prerit he
 He said that some Muslim people were also involved in the SC movement and they are also involved in this movement
 aapako bataa den ki centre sarkaar dwaara supreme court ke faisle ko palatate hueishchh / ST actmen sanshodhan kar mul swaroop main behaal karne par savarnon ne aaj bharat band bulaayaa he
 Bharat bandh has been called by many upper caste organizations
 ramshankar katheria ne kaha ki SC / ST act main koi badlaav nahin kiya gaya he
 The law which was there before is the same today
 unhone kaha ki isamen koi sansodhan nahin hua he
 The law which was 6 months ago is the same today
 ramshankar ne kaha ki desh main bahut se kanoon hai
 Do all laws follow? kis kanoon kaa galat istemaal nahin hota
 The abuser is the officer
 iske liye vah adhikari hi jimmedaar he
 This law is for preventing exploitation and for justice
 bijepi saansad ne kaha ki main desh kii janata seppeshchh kamishnake chairman hone ke naate apil karata hum ki kisi prakaar kaa sanshodhan isamen nahin hua
 What was there today is the same as before

 Kohli had won the Indian team by playing an aggressive innings of 183 runs in the Asia Cup match against Pakistan in Bangladesh
 isse pehle unhone austrailia main srilanka ke khilaaf pahaad jaise lakshya kaa peechha karte hue team ko jeet tak pahunchaaya tha
 Tendulkar arrived in Mumbai from Dhaka after being eliminated from India's Asia Cup tournament
 unhone apane bahupratikshit 100wein antarrashtriya shatak ke bare main kaha ki unke liye yah aitihaasik shatak lagaana aasaan nahin tha
 He said, 'the pressure has gone away
 yah mushkil samay tha or ham sabhi ko iske liye kaaphi intjaar karnaa padaa
 But this made everyone, including me, realize that it is not easy to score another century even after scoring 99 centuries
 ’asia cap se bharat ke baahar hone par tendulkar ne kaha, ‘ham har match jeetne gayi the or kabhi kabhaar har match jeetna sambhav nahin hota he or kabhi kabhaar vipakshi aapse behatar cricket khelte hai or aisa hi hua

 How can death be distributed so easily
 yahi jaanane ke liye ajtak kii team mosul ja pahunchi taaki aap tak jamini hakeekat ko pahunchaaya ja sake
 On 22 October, we came to know that Minister of State for External Affairs General VK Singh was going to Iraq to search for 39 missing Hindustanis
 khabar milte hi 23 aktubar kii raat hi hamaare varisht samvaadadaata shams taahir khan apane sahyogi gaurav saavant or cameraman kripal singh ke saath dilli se baghdad ke liye nikal pade
 There are no direct flights from India to Baghdad
 lihaaja hamaari team pehle dilli se dubai pahunchi
 After this, after catching another flight from Dubai, on the evening of 23 October, our team reached Baghdad Airport at exactly half past five in the local time
 hamaari team ko baghdad ke bare main koi jaankaree nahin thi
 Our team did not even know where they would go and how they would stay
 It was eight o'clock in the night as they came out of the airport
 iske baad ve do taxi badal kar baghdad ke karada ilaaka pahunche
 Someone told our team at the airport that the place is fine and the hotel will be easily found there
 raat kareeb das baje hamaari team ne karada outer ke life pales hotel main check in kisia
 Aaj Tak's team reached the Indian Embassy The next morning, our team reached the Indian Embassy in Baghdad
 general wike singh se yaheen unki mulaakaat honi thi or aage ke safar ke bare main yaheen se jaankaree milani thi
 Our team knew that we would have to go to Mosul, Badush and Irbil to search for 39 Indians
 ye teenon hi jagah behad khatarnaak thim
 There were now skirmishes against Iraqi forces, Kurdish, rebels and ISIS
 dopaher hote-hote hamaari team ko pataa chalaa ki vadesh rajya mantri baghdad pahunch chuke hai or ve baghdad ke green jone ilaake main tehre hai
 Green zone means the most secure area in Baghdad
 bhartiya duutavas main hi hamaari team kii mulaakaat jaranal wike singh se hui
 He told our team about his plan
 hamaari team ko bharosa tha ki ve videsh rajya mantri ke saath mosul jaaenge
 Traveling about 410 kilometers by road from Baghdad to Mosul was extremely dangerous
 kyonki sadaken sunsaan thim or kai jagahon par iesas kii maujuudagi ab bhi barkaraar he
 But Dushwari was that Mosul Airport was closed
 hamaari team mosul sirf iraqi fouj kii suraksha main general wike singh ke kafile ke saath hi ja sakati thi
 But at the last moment we came to know that General VK Singh left for Mosul in a special Iraqi Army aircraft
 akele mosul chale gaye wike singhgeneral wike singh ke akele mosul chale jane kii khabar hamaari team ke liye jatke jaisi thi
 They did not understand what to do now? How to reach Mosul? Everyone explained to our team that give up your intention to go to Mosul by road
 khatra bahut he
 But there was no other way to reach there
 or hamen to har haal main mosul pahunchnaa tha
 Earlier, on the second day of our team reaching Baghdad, it was told that the news had spread in Baghdad that three Sahafis of India, ie three journalists of India are roaming here
 hamaare liye ye khabar buree thi
 Because we were told that the impact of ISIS in Baghdad is certainly not that much
 magar unke sleeper cell yahaan ab bhi jagah-jagah chupe hai
 We were advised to change the hotel immediately
 lihaaja hamaari team ne raat main hi apana hotel badal liya or subah-subah baghdad se nikal kar mosul jane kaa faisla kar liya
 The next morning, the cab changed into our journey from Baghdad to Mosul
 team ko kuch nahin pataa tha ki ve apni manzil tak pahunch paaenge bhi yaa nahin
 On the way there were check posts of army and police at every distance
 hamaari team ko driver lagaataar aagaah kar rahaa tha ki ve camera chupa kar rakhen
 Do not shoot anything even from mobile
 par jahaan hamaari team ko mauka mila ve chupchaap mobile yaa camere se shoot karte rahe
 The signs of ruin were seen, it was fine till Balad, but after that as soon as our team moved forward, the signs of ruin were clearly visible at the hands of Baghdadi
 ajtak kii team un ilaakon se gujri, jahaan dahesh yani iesas kii maujuudagi ab bhi he
 Our team was constantly moving closer to Mosul via Dijail, Rafia and Samara
 hamaari team ke driver ne pehle hi bataa diya tha ki vah taxi sirf suraj kii roshni main hi chalaaegaa
 The evening journey was risky
 isliye shaam hone se pehle hi ajtak kii team kisi mahfuj jagah par ruk jaati
 The journey would start again in the morning
 tamaam dar or dehshat ke bich ab tak kaa safar thik thaak tha
 But after this, for the first time our team realized what dangerous journey they were on
 samara ke kareeb team ke interprator ne bataaya ki is ilaake main daaish ne kuch makaanon ko dhamaake se uda diya he
 Explosion marks and ruins of ruin still exist there
 hamane fouran faisla kiya ki ham un khadnharon ko shoot karenge
 So we took the car off the highway on the raw road and then walked on foot and this was our biggest mistake till date
 ek sunsaan gaanv jaisaa ilaaka jahaan dur-dur tak koi nahin dikh rahaa tha
 Suddenly, our team saw five-six people
 team ne sochaa ki inase baat kii jaae
 The interpreter had said that unless he says we will not shoot any ruins or man with a camera or mobile
 lihaaja pehle ham unke kareeb gaye
 After this, our interpreter told them in Arabic language that we are Hindi Sahafi i
e
 Indian journalists and that was the only mistake
 team se camera or mike chhiniske baad unamem se do logon ne hamaari team kaa camera or mike chin liya
 Then one of them gestured to our team and asked him to walk aside
 arabi main wo baar-baar jhaadiyon kii taraf ishaara kar shaayad dakhul-dakhul bol rahaa tha
 That is, i was asking to enter there
 team ko nahin maaloom tha ki wo log koun the
 Our team was caught in a shia-sunni feud? Were these Daesh supporters or angry local people or someone else? Our team did not know anything
 par shaayad hamaari team kaa naseeb acha tha, kyonki thik usee vakt dur se siren kii aawaaj sunai di
 Because of the nervousness, at first we thought that Ajan has a voice
 magar phir dur gasht par iraqi fouj kii do-teen gaadiyaan aati dikhaai deen
 On seeing them, those five six people suddenly ran away throwing our team's camera and mic
 ab hamaari team ko laga ki ve mahfuj hai
 But it took them more than half an hour to recover
 is haadase ne ham teenon par aisa asar kiya ki bas faisla kar liya ki ab ham or aage nahin jaaenge
 The bus is to return to Delhi
 magar shaayad abhi bahut kuch or hona tha
 After leaving from there we found some Iraqi Special Forces personnel at a check post
 unamem se ek ko jab pataa chalaa ki ham bharat se hai to wo bahut khush hua
 Actually he was crazy about Bollywood movies and a big fan of Amitabh Bachchan
 wo hamen apane general ke paas le gaya
 We told the general of our arrival that we have come to search for 39 missing Indians
 iraqi sena ke daste ne badhaai himmatiske baad ab hamaari team iraqi forcej ke saath the
 For the first time since coming to Iraq, he felt safe
 wo hamaari team ko apane saath bagdadi ke haathon barbaad ilaake ko dikhaane apane saath le jane par raji ho gaye
 The danger still persisted in those areas
 par ab ve unke saath the
 After a while our team was in the area where Daish had recently blown up the house, shop all in a blast and made it into ruins
 har taraf tabaahi or barbaadi ke hi manjar the
 Iraqi Forces told our team that the danger in this area is still not averted
 par ve hamaari team ko baar-baar yakeen dilaa rahe the ki unke saath ve mahfuj hai
 There were check posts all over the village, where the Iraqi force was stationed
 phir vahaan ke logon se hamaari team ko milaayaa gaya
 Who told our team the story of Baghdadi and its terror
 iraqi sena ke saath gaanv kaa daura karne ke baad ve waapas check post pahunche
 He fed our team with his jawans and sent us off with the intention not to go further
 yani mosul kii taraf naa jaaen
 But by now our team had recovered and the passion to go to Mosul again was overpowered
 so ek baar phir hamaari team aage bad chali
 Towards Mosul
 jaan par khelkar mosul pahunchi ajtak kii tiub hamaari team kaa driver hi ab interprator bhi tha
 But he did not know English
 hamaari team ne rasta nikaala
 Through Google Translator on mobile, he spoke in English to Arabic and the driver kept telling our team in Arabic to English, but that driver was not convinced that our team should go to Mosul
 usne hamen mobile par arabi se angreji main translet kar ye baat kahi bhi
 As our team was moving closer to Mosul, their discomfort was increasing
 jis mosul or uski barbaadi kii kahani ham lagaataar sunate aa rahe the
 Ah he was very close to us
 par tabhi hamen pataa chalaa ki mosul main do dinon se ek baar phir kurdish fiter, baagi or iraqi forcej ke bich golibari shuru ho gai he
 But we still kept moving forward
 par yahaan se ab ek doosraa khatra khadaa tha
 We were told that Baghdadi gunpowder could be found on the way
 isliye sanbhal kar janaa hoga
 Finally that moment came when our team was in front of the city of Mosul
 mosul yani baghdad ke baad iraq kaa doosraa sabase bada shahar
 Mosul is the city that gave the world muslin cloth for the first time
 or usee malamal kii vajah se iskaa naam masalin or phir mosul padaa
 The manger of the city was shouting and saying that this is not a city of humans but a city of ghosts
 ghar khandhar or khandhar gharon main tabdeel the
 It seemed as if the bomb had been dropped all over the city
 jahaan bam apana kaam nahin kar paaya vahaan goliyon ke nishaan daro-diwaar par cheekh rahe the
 There was a thing called Sanatinesan everywhere
 jo the bas khamosh the
 Or there were dense settlements
 jahaan tak hamen jane kii ijaajat nahin thi or naa hi wo sahi faisla bhi hota
 Because in the guise of which person, which enemies did not come out
 yaa koun sa kadam jameen main chupe barood ke kis dher par pad jaae nahin pataa
 The city of Mosul was previously a very pleasant and vibrant city
 jise lafzon main bayaan nahin kiya ja saktaa
 But after 10 June 2014, Baghdadi and its terrorists suddenly came to Mosul
 bam, bandook or barood lekar un logon ne teen saal main is shahar ko barbaad kar diya
 Now far away there are broken buildings, houses transformed into ruins, ruined roads, piles of rubble everywhere and the restless boo of scattered ammo in the palace
 barbaad ho gaya mosuladansal iraq main iesas ke teen saal kii khilaafat kaa yahi hasil he
 Achieved that, which the common Iraqis would never have thought of, even the ISIS Khalifa Abu Bakr al Baghdadi and his operatives
 lekin iesas ne ek based-basaae shahar kii haalat kya kar di, ye dekh kar ab aam iraqi koon ke aansu ro rahe hai
 School-college, shop-market, hospital, office-restaurant, nothing is left here
 jo bache hai wo bhi apni taqadir par ro rahe hai
 But this is how much life Mosul has lost by scorching the ISIS in the fire of world things, to be honest, no one has the exact account of it right now
 mosulake logon ne to azaad phiza main saans lene kii aas hi chhod di thi
 It felt as if life would now pass under the shadow of these bayonets
 magar aakhirkaar mosul se iesas kaa khaatmaa ho hi gaya
 Mosul is the same place from where Baghdadi declared her caliphate and the rule of ISIS
 magar ab yahaan se aatankiyon ko khadeda ja chukaa he
 After three and a half years, the procession of terror from Mosul to Baghdadi finally came out
 lekin mosul ko bhuton ke shahar se insaanon kaa shahar banane main naa jane abhi kitna vakt or lagegaa
 The ground reality and photographs of 39 Indians looking for Mosul were in front of our team
 magar us sawaal kaa jawaab abhi tak nahin mila tha jiske liye hamaari team hindustan se vahaan tak gai thi
 39 Indians were searched in Mosul
 unka suraag dhundhna tha
 But this task was not so easy
 kyonki yahaan ke zyaadaatar logon ko un laapata bharatiyon ke bare main kuch pataa hi nahin tha
 Speaking of the Iraqi army and intelligence, they lacked any strong evidence or information
 par phir bhi hamen koshish kerani thi
 So after this, our team again started searching for 39 missing Indians
 darasal, laapata bharatiyon ko aakhri baar mosul ke badoosh ilaake main dekha gaya tha

 Rebel leaders of BJP can join hands with Congress
 narendra modi kii nitiyon ko lekar lagaataar sawaal khadey karne vaale bihari babu shatrughna sinha or darbhanga se bijepi ke nilambit saansad or purv cricketer kirti aaazaad congress se 2019 ke siyaasi ran main apni kismat ajama sakate hai
 If sources are to be believed, Shatrughan Sinha, who is angry with the BJP, may contest from the North East seat of Delhi in the upcoming 2019 Lok Sabha elections on a Congress ticket
 ve apni daavedaari ko pakki karne ke liye congress netaaon ke sampark main bhi hai
 Currently, BJP state president Manoj Tiwari is the MP from this seat
 bihari babu philhal biharke patna sahib loksabhaa seat se saansad hai
 Election speculation is being said by party leaders about Shatrughan joining Congress and contesting from the North East seat of Delhi
 par saaf taur par inkaar bhi nahin kar rahi
 There is a large population of voters of Purvanchal region on this seat
 pichley dinon shatrughna sinha ne argedy ke iftaar party main pahunchakar spasht sanket die the ki wo mahagathbandhan ke tikat par chunaav lard sakate hai
 Not only this, the relationship with their opposition party leaders is much better
 mahagathbandhan main vaise bhi patna sahib kii seat congress ke khate main he
 It is believed that Shatrughan Sinha will contest on the Congress ticket
 haalanki, argedy kii taraf se bhi unhen tikat kaa ofer he
 His closeness to Aam Aadmi Party leader and Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, who holds power in Delhi, is not hidden from anyone
 bataa den ki pichley dinon kirti aaazaad ne bhi congress ke tikat par chunaav ladane kaa sanket die hai
 While speaking to journalists in Darbhanga, he strongly praised Congress President Rahul Gandhi
 unki patni punam aaazaad pehle hi congress kaa daaman tham chuki hai
 In such a situation, he is very likely to go to Congress
 kirti aaazaad congress main shamilhone ke sanket bhale hi de rahe hon, lekin duvidha ye he ki unki darbhanga seat se argedy chunaav ladati rahi he
 In such a situation it can be difficult to get a ticket from the Congress
 ashraf fatmi argedy kii tikat par saansad rah chuke hai or centre kii upie sarkaar main mantri bhi rahe hai
 Kirti Azad had said that in the circumstances created by the BJP, he has only one option left
 ab wo darbhanga se kisi or party se chunaav ladenge or wo vikalp ek rashtriya party hogi
 The sign of Kirti's departure in the Congress was seen even more when Kirti Azad had praised Rahul Gandhi fiercely and said that under the efficient leadership of Rahul, the Congress Party is moving forward very fast

 All-rounder Kevon Fubler, who played for Bermuda in the West Indies, got angry after being dismissed first by stumps and then by the umpire, which led to a seven-year ban
 fubler ne pehle kaha tha ki agar use out diya gaya to vah vikaton par apana gussa nikaalega, phir usne wo kar ke bhi dikhaa diya
 When the umpire gave him a 'leg before wicket' ie LBW out, he said that he got his anger out on the wicket
 lekin baat yaheen khatm ho jaati to shaayad itani badi naa banati
 He then misbehaved with the umpire
 is puure vaakye main badi baat ye rahi kii fubler kaa gussa maidan chhodane ke baad tak jari rahaa
 It would have been that such hard action and action against him would not have been taken had he not intentionally thrown the ball towards the umpire after leaving the field
 tippaniyan Result 7 year ban fubler kaa gussa uske cricket kariyar par baari pad gaya kyonki is khilaadi ko level 4 ofence kaa doshi paaya gaya

 mangalvaar ko hui disiplinary meeting main ye faisalaa liya gaya
 Significantly, Fubler continued to play on the field even after all this and he scored 6
 3 over bhi iske baad phenke
 Even before this, West Indies players have been banned isse pehle southampton ke captain janero takar par ek match kaa nilamban stamps ko giraane ke liye laga tha, jab ballebaaz ne unki gend par chaukaa maaraa to unhone aavesh main stamps gira die
 Fubler was also banned from Somerset Cricket Club in 2011 after he abused selector Molly Simmons as he was not included in the squad
 bermuda ne isse pehle wicketiper jesan anderson par aaajeevan pratibandh laga diya tha kyonki unhone maidan par gendbaaj jorge o bryan ke saath pichley sizan ladaai kii thi
 The big thing in this whole sentence was that Fubler's anger continued till he left the field
 ho saktaa tha ki uske khilaaf itani kadi karrwai or ection naa liya gaya hota agar usne maidan chhodane ke baad ampire kii taraf jaanboojhkar gend naa phenki hoti
 The comments nateeja 7 saal kaa pratibandh Fubler's anger was overshadowed by his cricketing career as the player was found guilty of a Level 4 offense

 Bermuda had previously banned wicketkeeper Jason Anderson for a lifetime as he had a fight last season with on-field bowler George o'brien

 While Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman was presenting the Union Budget for 2019-20, 30-year-old Tarun Mehta, co-founder of electric scooter manufacturer Ather Energy, is preparing for a major launch in Chennai, which has 4 million two-wheelers on its roads

 or isse behatar samay kya ho saktaa tha
 On 5 July Sitharaman made several announcements to promote electric vehicles (e-vehicles)
 inamen maal or seva kar (jiesti) main katautee bhi shaamil he jise is bajet main 12 pratishat se ghataakar 5 pratishat kar diya gaya he
 Mehta's Bangalore plant can produce 30,000 electric scooters in a year
 mehta kehete hai, ''yah behad saraahneey faisla he
 Prices will decrease for both manufacturers and customers
 '' ek ore jahaan sarkaar ne i-vaahanon ko or adhik kifayati banane ke liye kharidaaron ke liye iskar main chhot kii bhi ghoshnaa kii he lekin bajet main start-ap ke liye samgr rup se bahut kuch he
 Mehta and his co-founding partner, 30-year-old Swapnil Jain, started work on developing lithium ion battery packs at the beginning of the decade
 jain iity madras ke purv chaatr hai
 His efforts resulted in an electric scooter, the Aether S340, taking shape in 2013
 lekin ve aasaan din nahin the
 "the paperwork was endless," recalls Mehta
 ''or sabase adhik pareshaan karne vaali baat yah thi ki adhikari prayek karmchaaree kaa upasthiti record rakhane par bahut jor de rahe the, jo kisi sangharshrat start-ap ke liye vastav main mukhya focus kii cheez nahin thi
 According to the Economic Survey on 4 July, India is ranked third in the world in the start-up ecosystem
 ity udyog ke sanghathan nascom kaa anumaan he ki bharat main har saal 1,200 se adhik tech start-ap shuru hote hai
 At a time when the government has made a lot of efforts to reduce unemployment (unemployment rate 6 in 2017-18
 1% thi- 45 varsh main sarvaadhik), start-ap par jor dene se adhik naukariyaan paidaa hongi
 Despite the difficulties, the government launched Start-up India in January 2016 with the aim of facilitating business operations for new businesses
 iske liye karon main chhot pradaan karnaa or ek aisa echosystem bananaa tha jisase bharat nae vyavsaay ke liye aakarshak sthaan bane
 Start-up India has set up Rs 10,000 crore with Small Industries Development Bank (SIDBI)
 kaa fund banaaya jo incubetter sthapit karne, self-certification aadi ke liye tha or in sabakaa uddeshy tha—nae udhyamon ko badhaava dena
 However, three years have passed but it could not be brought to the ground
 jabaki audyogic niti or sanvardhan vibhaag (diipipi) ne 14,036 fermon ko start-ap ke rup main manyata di lekin november 2018 tak inamen se keval 91 ko hi tex laabh lene kaa anumodan mila
 India's rank survey has improved in the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business 2019 report
 ranking main 23 paaydaan kaa sudhaar hua or yah 190 deshon ke bich 77wein sthaan par pahunchi he lekin abhi bahut kuch kiya janaa shesh he
 Chris Gopalakrishnan, former vice-president of Infosys and now chairman of Axillar Ventures, a start-up fund company, says, "we have to help the start-up at every stage to move forward and the domestic funding to the end stage More effort is needed to encourage
 baad ke charnon main jab start-ap apana bijness model sabit kar dikhaate hai or unka bade paimaane par ubhaar shuru hota he tab unke liye fund kaa bada hissaa desh ke baahar ke sroton se aata he or is tarah vah vyavsaay gaiyr-bhartiya swaamitv vaala ho jaataa he
 Many times it happens that the registered office of that successful start-up also gets shifted outside India
 ''beshak, 2018 main bhartiya start-ap ne 7
 5 billion dollars (51,750 crore rupees)
 ) jutaaye hai, jo haal ke samay main sabase adhik he
 Hospitality aggregator Oyo Rooms ($ 90 million or Rs 6,210 crore)

 Already 10 start-ups in the country are in the 'unicorn Club' (a 'unicorn' for $ 1 billion or Rs 6,900 crore)

 Walmart's Flipkart had $ 16 billion in 2018 (1, despite criticisms of over-valuation

 More than), the acquisition was seen as a perfect example of Indian unicorns making huge profits for their founders
 bajet main mila badhawakendriya bajet main is kshetra ke liye baadhak banane vaale muddon ke samaadhaan kii koshishen hoti dikh rahi hai
 One of the major problems has been the so-called 'angel Tax'
 iske tahat, kendriya pratyaksh kar board (sibiditi) se tay uchit mulya se upar start-ap main hua koi bhi nivesh us start-ap ke liye aay samajha jaataa tha or vah kar lagaae jane ke yogya ho jaataa tha
 Angel Tax was introduced in 2012 and it was seen that the department showed hyperactivity to the extent it was troubling, especially in 2017
 haalanki, sitaraman ne is pattern ko badalane kaa faisla kiya he
 According to him, "start-ups and their investors who file the required details and provide this information in their returns will not be subject to any scrutiny in relation to the valuation of the start-up share premium
 ''i-veriphication system ke jariye niveshkon or dhan strot kii pahchaan ke mudde ko hal kiya jayega
 He said that this would make the start-ups different from the requirement of any kind of investigation by the Income Tax Department regarding the funds raised
 iske alaava, lambit akalan or shikayaton ke nivaaran ke liye sibiditi main vishesh prashasnic vyavastha kii jaaegi
 "it is a good initiative," says Shantanu Deshpande, CEO and founder of the start-up Boxbe Shaving Company, which started in 2015 to sell men's beauty products online
 shuruaati charan kii companiyon kaa moolyankan riyayati nakadi pravaah (disief) vidhi se nahin kiya ja saktaa or yah tex premiyamon ke liye vicitra sthiti paidaa kar detaa he
 "investment in companies at DCF is evaluated on the basis of future cash flows
" haalanki, niveshak is prayaas ko bhi oont ke munh main jire jaisi baat maanate hai
 "these have been issued as explanations and guidelines," says Gopalakrishnan
 isliye bahut kuch is par nirbhar karegaa ki isaki vyakchaya kaise kii ja rahi he, or ise kis prakaar lagu kiya janaa he isse judi chunautiyon bhi hongi
 There are several cases which are pending
 unke niraakaran kii aavashyaktaa he
 '' However, one day after the budget, CBDT President P
K
 si
 Modi said that all the 'old hurdles' related to start-ups would be resolved through a consultation process
 kepiemji main partner or neshnal head tex, vivek gupta kehete hai, ''dhara 56 kii vyavastha durbhaavnapurna len-dein ko rokane ke liye hui thi, lekin start-ap ke maamle main isko jis tarah lagu kiya gaya, usase inke echosystem ko bahut pareshaani hui he
 According to section 56 (2) (7B) of the Income Tax Act, recipients are eligible for tax for gifts received
 start-ap ko is section ke tahat tex ke notice bheje ja rahe the, jisamen unhen praapt hone vaale 'anjal fund' par karon kaa bhugtan karne ko kaha ja rahaa tha
 Now, the government has clarified that it will not scrutinize any evaluation report as long as it remains a registered part of the start-up ecosystem
 gupta kehete hai, ''isse nae maamalon main madad milegi or yah majboot iraade kaa sanket bhi he
 But everything will depend on how it is implemented
 ''vitt mantri ne start-ap ke bahi-khate main nuksaan ko kairi forward (agle saal ke liye lekar jane) yaa iske niptaare kii sharton main dheel di he
 They have also increased the period of exemption in capital gains arising from the sale of a home for investment in start-ups
 isse shuruaati varshon main adhik raahat milane kii ummid he
 Start-ups that have a lot of potential have huge investments initially and do not make any profit in this period
 deshpandey kehete hai ki ghate main chal rahe start-ap par jiesti kam karne yaa sabsidi dene se unhen badi madad mil sakati he
 After the launch of Google Pixels, it has become clear that now the next round is of artificial intelligence in smartphones
 vaise to pehle bhi google or aipal smartphone oparating system main artificial intelligence yuj karte aae hai
 Apple has Siri and Google has Google Now
 lekin google picksal aisa pehla smartphone he jisamen in bilt artificial intelligence besd google acystant diya gaya he
 This is much better than Google Now, Siri and Microsoft's Cortana

 Whether you want to fix a meeting or book a ticket, you can easily do this work by speaking with it

 After Google, Apple and Microsoft, now the world's largest smartphone maker Samsung is also ready to try Artificial Intelligence in its smartphones
 iske liye company ne ek mashhoor artificial intelligence company kaa adhigrahan bhi kar liya he
 According to reports, the company is going to provide in-built artificial intelligence in its next flagship i
e
 Galaxy S8

 After the Galaxy Note 7 tragedy, the company wants to leave no stone unturned to make the next smartphone number-1
 aipal ke digitas acystant siri ko banane vaali company Viv Labs ko samsung ne kharid liya he or ab yah samsung ke liye digital acystant banaaegi
 Since Samsung manufactures many things, its digital assistant can also be seen in its other products
 haalaakin samsung ne abhi yah saaf nahin kiya he ki artificial intelligence ke jariye Galaxy S8 main kis tarah kii sarvice degi
 It is being told that this assistant will help customers to use third party services
 kya he artificial intelligenceartificial intelligence ke intilange kaa andaja aap is baat se laga sakate hai ki haal hi main google ke artificial intelligence ne duniya ke number- GO player ko isaki game main maat de di
 That is, it is very intelligent and has the ability to learn like humans
 saadhaaran shabdon main kahen to artificial intelligence computer science kaa ek branch he jise intellegent mashin banane ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Under this, the machine is made so that it can work and react like humans
 deep larning ke jariye yah insaanon kii tarah sikhta hagoogle or fasebuk jaisi companiyaan in dinon bad chadh kardip larning technology kaa yujakar rahi hai
 Through software, the voice and face recognition of users from the cloud works
 iske alaava qolkom ne ek aisa software deveopment kit launch kiya he jo deep larning ko cloud se smartphone main bhejti he
 Artificial Intelligence is the future of smartphones
 After Apple, Microsoft, Samsung is now preparing to give Artificial Intelligence based digital assist in its smartphone
 isse saaf he ki ab dhire dhire yah hai and smartphone kii jarurat ban jayega or inke yugers ke liye bhi
 Apart from these companies, other companies like Xiaomi, Lenovo, Lyco and One Plus can also bring such assistants in the coming years

 People are calling me and abusing me and doing obscene things

 The country's biggest economic reform Goods and Services Tax (GST) will launch in a grand ceremony held in Parliament
 centre sarkaar or khud pradhanmantri narendra modi ke liye ye ek badi uplabdhi he
 The one-country-one-tax system that is going to be implemented through GST will make it easier to do business in India, stop tax evasion, make tax process easier and the government's revenue will increase, which will also see growth in GDP
 yahi vajah he ki bijepi jiesti ko 2019 kii chunavi jang ke liye ek bada hathiyaar maan rahi he
 But if you look at the history, then this big bet can also be reversed for him
 sarkaar kii lokapriyata main kamicanada kii pragatisheel conzarvative party ke netaa, pradhanmantri kim campbell ko 1993 ke rashtriya chunaav main karaari haar dekhni padi thi kyonki unki sarkaar ne jiesti ko lagu karne ke baad apni lokapriyata kho di thi
 The taxation law was rejected by nearly 80 percent of voters after which the Liberal Party, led by Jean Shiretin, secured a strong majority in the House and formed the next government of Canada
 australia main, jon howard sarkaar ne jiesti ko lagu karne ke turant baad 1998 main chunaav main badi mushkil se vaapasi kii
 Most of the countries implementing GST faced high inflation
 singapore ne bhi 1994 main jab jiesti lagu kiya to vahaan mahangaai kaaphi badi thi
 Increasing inflation is a big issue
 After the implementation of GST, there is a high probability of inflation in India too
 agar aisa hua to aaj jiesti ko lekar bijepi kaa samarthan kar rahe log kal uske virodh main ja sakate hai
 Earlier, the Congress acted to hang the GST
 nateeja ye hua ki jiesti ab jaakar lagu ho rahi he or mana ja rahaa he ki uske lagu hone ke baad agle do-teen saal tak mahangaai badhegi
 That is, when the votes are being cast for the 2019 elections, then the public will be troubled by inflation
 agar aisa hua to bijepi ko chunaav main isaki keemat chukaani pad sakati he
 Not only this, many important states like Gujarat, Karnataka, Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh will have assembly elections soon
 inamen se karnataka or himachal pradesh main congress kaa raaj he jabaki baaki rajyon main bhaajapa satta main he
 If people are angry with GST, it will be very difficult for BJP to retain its power in these states
 vyapaariyon kaa gussa?vyapaaree varg bijepi kaa paaramparik matadaata mana jaataa he
 Now that GST is going to be implemented, traders are angry in many places across the country
 kuch jagahon par to kal vyapaariyon ne bijness band rakhane kaa elaan kiya he
 Traders are afraid that the new tax structure will create difficulties for them as they will have to file nearly three times tax returns as before
 iske alaava billing ke mudde bhi aise hai jinpar unhen lag rahaa he ki wo apana vartmaan profit bachaa paane main safal nahin ho paaenge
 This is the class that is already facing the ban of demonetisation, now it can stand against BJP due to the shock of GST
 vipaksh ke liye mauka-maukaamodi sarkaar ke aane ke baad se ab tak teen saal guzar chuke hai lekin vipaksh koi aisa mudda dhundne main safal nahin ho paaya he jisase wo ekajute hokar sarkaar ko katghare main khadaa kar sake or jisamen janata kaa bhi saath use mili
 During demonetisation, some parties, especially the Trinamool Congress and Aam Aadmi Party had made such efforts but they could not succeed much because neither the traders nor the general public got any support but if inflation increased due to GST, the opposition united the center May attack kolkata police consteble kolkata ke eden gardens main ravivaar ko keker or kings ilevan punjab kaa match dekhne gaye lekin unhen isaki bahut mahangi keemat chukaani padi

 mayawati aisi shakhsiyat hai jinhone dalit raajnneeti ko ek mukaam dilaayaa, use sattashin karaayaa
 It is not that no Scheduled Caste leader has climbed the ladder of power in the politics of the country before him, but Mayawati is different because four times in an important state like Uttar Pradesh as the leader of the Bahujan Samaj Party, the Dalit politics
 Became Chief Minister
 pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaaron main bhi unhen gina gaya
 But the party suffered at the leadership level after the party's tough defeats in the 2012 assembly and 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 is dauraan party ke kai kaddavar netaaon ne party chodi yaa party main ubhar rahe yuva netaaon se mayawati ne khud hi duuri bana lee
 Swami Prasad Maurya and Naseemuddin Siddiqui are names that were considered second-line leaders in the Bahujan Samaj Party
 kaha jaataa he ki party main mayawati ke baad swami prasad maury kaa sthaan aata tha, lekin upi vidhansabha chunaavon ke pehle unki raah basapa se juda ho gai
 Swami Prasad Maurya joined the Bharatiya Janata Party
 unke baad nasimuddin siddiqui bhi party se alag ho congress main chale gaye
 Nasimuddin was known as the link that used to connect Muslims with the party
 basapa main yah ek silsil he jo jari he
 In the Hindi belt of North India, Kanshi Ram laid the foundation of Dalit politics and formed the Bahujan Samaj Party
 netritv kshamta or siyaasi sambhaavnaaon ko dekhte hue unhone mayawati ko aage badhaayaa
 Mayawati brought the BSP to power with hard work and political acumen
 unki apni raajnneetik takat hi he ki jab bhi siyaasi galiyare main pradhanmantri pad ke daavedaaron kii charchaa hoti he, unamem mayawati kaa naam bhi liya jaataa he
 Mayawati is celebrating her 63rd birthday today and for the first time her party is going to contest in an alliance
 par sawaal he ki mayawati ke baad koun? koun hoga jo unki raajnneeti ko aage le jayega?party yaa usase itar ubhar rahe dalit yuva chehron se bhi vah duuri banaati huin dikhti hai
 On the question about Mayawati after her release from jail, Bhim Army President Chandrashekhar had said, 'she is a member of my family
 meri buaa hai
 i am his nephew
 hamaara unka paariwarik rishta he
 On this statement of Chandrasekhar, a day later, Mayawati's statement came and she rejected Chandrashekhar's statements outright
 mayawati ne bayaan jari kar kah diya, ‘kuch log raajnneetik swaarth main to kuch apane bachaav main mere saath kabhi bhai-bahan kaa, to kabhi buaa-bhattije kaa rishta bataa rahe hai
 The person who has just been released in Saharanpur case is telling me his aunt
 meraa aise logon se koi rishta nahin he
 Before joining the Congress, the party also distanced itself from Devashish Jararia, who had bsp's opinion on social media and television challenges
 basapa ne bayaan jari kar devashish jaraariya ke party se kisi tarah ke rishte ko khaarij kar diya
 In a statement issued on behalf of the BSP it was said that the people of BSP, especially the youth, need to be cautious about the fake and unauthorized organization run by Devashish Jararia in the name of 'BSP Youth'
 ’devashish jaraariya ko isse dhakka laga or vah congress main shaamil ho gaye
 Devashish Jararia, who hails from Madhya Pradesh, aajtak
 in se baatcheet main kaha, 'yuva netaaon se mayawati kii duuri samaj se pare he
 He recently removed BSP national vice-president Jai Prakash from the party
 jo yuva netaa party main sakriy hota use baahar nikaal diya jaataa he
 i was trying to connect the youth of Bahujan society with the party through social media, but they did not like it
 isse basapa ko hi nuksaan hua he
 After the defeat in Uttar Pradesh's two assembly elections in 2012 and 2017 and again in the Lok Sabha elections 2014, the existence of BSP with Mayawati began to be questioned
 2007 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main 206 siton par chunaav jitkar bahumat kii sarkaar banane vaali mayawati 2012 main 80 siton par simat gayi
 The situation worsened in 2017 and the BSP could win only 19 seats in the assembly
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main 4 pratishat kaa sammanjanak vot share hasil karne ke baavjood basapa ise jeet vaali siton main tabdeel nahin kar pai
 Devashish Jararia claims, 'the BSP lost its distance from youth and social media
 2013 ke vidhansabha chunaav main madhya pradesh main basapa ke chaar vidhayak jite the, lekin 2018 main yah sankhya ghatakar 2 ho gai
 The BSP received 31 per cent of the votes in Morena in the 2013 elections, but in 2018 it came down to 19 per cent
 ’ iske liye unhone aarope lagaaya ki madhya pradesh main yuva kaaryakartaaon ko darkinar karne kaa khamiyaja party ko bhugatna padaa
 He says, 'she considers new Dalit faces a challenge, so she keeps distance from them whether she is Chandrashekhar Azad, Jignesh Mevani
 ’ Union Finance and Corporate Affairs Minister Nirmala Sitharaman presented the Economic Review 2018-19 in Parliament on Thursday
 isamen ek khaas baat kahi gai he ki nijee kshetra keval vahiin nivesh karata he jahaan use laabh dikhataa he
 In such a situation, the government should intervene and collect data of those sectors where the private sector has not invested
 taaki iskaa istemaal garibon ke utthan or beharti ke liye kiya ja sake
 The Economic Review states that governments already have administrative, survey, institutional and transaction data of citizens, but it has not been used properly
 ye soochna vibhinn sarkari nikaayon main maujuud he
 In such a situation, the government can formulate appropriate policies based on these data
 in nitiyon or plan ke jariye garib janata ke liye kalyankari yojanaayen banaai ja sakati hai or unka jivan str sudhara ja saktaa he
 Where the private sector showed profit, the private sector has invested so far where they benefit
 aise main sarkaar ko ab un saamaajik kshetron main nivesh karne kii jarurat he jahaan kaa data ab tak ekatra nahin kiya gaya he
 However, data usage has also increased in the last few years
 vaishvik data kaa buniyadi dhaancha vishwasaneey, tej or surakshit he
 In such a situation, there is a need to collect it on a large scale in India too
 pehle data jamaa karne main kai pareshaaniyon kaa saamana karnaa padataa tha, lekin ab data collection kaa kaam aasaan hua he
 Now advanced technology exists for this
 is kaaran kam kharch main hi data ikattha kiya ja saktaa he
 The need to collect the data of citizens within the purview of privacy law has always raised the question of whether there is a violation of privacy law
 isliye data jamaa karte samay niztaa kii jatilta kaa dhyaan rakhaa janaa chahie
 The Economic Review states that this can be achieved even by maintaining transparency
 ab nunatam kharch par data ekatrit karne, sangrahan, prasanskaran or uske vistaar main kaaphi suvidha uplabdh he
 The Economic Review states that citizens can experience better services by collecting the databases scattered in different ministries at one place, i
e
 the government can provide better service to its citizens through it
 isse kalyankari yojanaon main truti kii ashanka bhi kam hogi
 The Economic Review states that the data collected in various fields has not been used yet
 sarkaar ko chahie ki saamaajik rup se jaruri data kaa upyog sunishchit kiya jaae
 The government needs to take steps in this area
 samiksha main kaha gaya he ki data ko logon ke dwaara, logon ke liye ekatrit kiya janaa chahie
 During this time care should be taken that the priority of privacy of rich people should not be imposed on the poor
 samiksha main kaha gaya he ki bharat aadhaar ke jariye data or praudyogiki ke morche par kranti kar rahaa he
 The importance of data should be equated with the importance of national highways
 saath hi samvidhan kii bhaavana ke tahat data logon kaa, logon ke dwaara, logon ke liye hona chahie

 faridabad ke is chaatr ne apni kamyaabi main emvien skool ke saath hi koching santhaan fitji ke yogadan ko bhi ahm mana he jahaan ve hafte main do din padhane ke liye jate the
 Says Arpit, "I was looking for a place that could assure me of good results
 ''unke pita o
 P
 agarwal bhi maanate hai ki safalataa ke liye unke bete kii privet koching jaruri thi kyonki sibiesai or iity-jeii kii parikshaon ke pattern alag-alag hai
 He says, "coaching gives the child direction and he studies regularly
 compitishan itnaa zyada he ki uchit maargdarshan kii khatir bacchon ke liye koching jaruri ho jaati he
 '' Arpit got 96 in CBSE exam
 5 fisadi or pisiem group main 98 fisadi marks mili
 Similarly, Bijoy Kochhar, who finished second in IIT-JEE, has also achieved success with the help of coaching in Chandigarh
 isi saal bihar main bhojpur jile ke bakhorapur gaanv ke satyam kumaar ne maatr 12 varsh kii aayu main iity kii pariksha paas kar lee
 In the absence of a good school in the village, Satyam's talent at home education, apart from his parents, was the CEO of Kota's coaching institute Resonance

 Varma also recognized and took all the expenses of his studies
 saaf he ki ejineering hi nahin, medical, management, upiessi or banking sahit kai tarah kii pratiyogi parikshaon main bhi koching kii badaulat safalataa ke dheron udhaaharan mil jaaenge
 But there are other examples of success
 manipur kii rajdhani imphal se 39 kimi dur lilong ke rahane vaale mohammad ismat ne sibiesai kii 12veen kaksha main 99 fisadi ank hasil kiye or desh bhar main awwal rahe
 He believed in himself and worked hard with discipline

 Gopal's father Nandlal and mother Shantibai, apart from own farming, labore in the fields of others
 gopal ke pita itane sakshar hai ki apana naam hi likh sakate hai
 After seeing these fresh examples, the question arises whether coaching is necessary or not
 is bare main iity graduate or koching kaarobaar main desh kaa pehla safal ipio laane vaale kota ke 18 saal puraane koching santhaan kariyar point ke chairman or prabandh nideshak pramod maheshwari kehete hai, ''koching madadgaar he lekin, sach kaha jaae to pratibhashali chaatro ke liye koching jaruri nahin he
 It needs more than average students and some better students
 ''chaatro kii pratibha ke alaava kai sarkari or nijee skulon kii padhai pratiyogi parikshaon yaa pravesh parikshaon main safalataa ko pakkaa nahin karti
 In such a situation, no parent wants to risk
 sitambar, 2011 main deshbhar main faile koching sansthaanon par udyog sanghathan asocham kii ek report main khulaasa hua ki 70 fisadi maa-baap apane bacchon ko koching dilaanaa chaahate hai
 Assocham surveyed 800 families in eight cities, including Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata and Bangalore
 survey ke mutabik, koching udyog teji se bad rahaa he or ab iskaa kaarobaar kareeb 16,500 karod ru
 Is done till fitji ke nideshak aar
 L
 trikha ke mutabik, ''yadi skool apana kaam acchhee tarah karenge to koching centaron kii jarurat hi nahin hogi
 Students are their own judges and they decide to choose the coaching center according to their needs
 ''darasal, schuli shiksha ke saath-saath koching lene kaa chalan badha he
 In today's Bhagabhagam life, the importance of coaching is increasing amidst stiff competition in the entrance examinations
 abhibhavak apane bacchon ko padhaane ke liye skool ke alaava privet tution yaa koching sansthaanon par nirbhar hai, jahaan bachche skool ke homework se lekar concept clear karne or lagaataar abhyaas ke liye koching kaa sahaara lete hai
 But a large part of the coaching business has grown randomly and has also been questioned
 pichley hafte hi centre sarkaar dwaara sanchalit desh ke aalaa ejineering sansthaanon kii pravesh prakriya main badlaavon kii ghoshnaa kii gai he
 With the intention of implementing the concept of 'huek nation a test', Union HRD Minister Kapil Sibal has announced new rules to "relieve students from psychological and economic pressures"
 ''iske alaava yah bhi uddeshy he ki koching sansthaanon kii jagah 12veen kaksha kii schuli padhai ko tarjeeh mili
 The exam, taken from the new pattern, will have three parts - one is the 12th board examination, the second main test and the third advanced test
 antim donon test ke ek-ek prashn patr honge, jinaki pariksha ek hi din lee jaaegi
 In place of IIT-JEE and AIEEE, this joint examination will be called JEE from the year 2013
 bhartiya praudyogiki sansthaanon (iity) ko chhodkar kendriya vittiya sahaayta praapt duusare santhaan jaise tripal ity or enity main chaatro ko pravesh dene ke liye 12veen board ke parinaam ko 40 fisadi, jeii main test ke parinaam ko 30 fisadi or jeii advanced test ke parinaam ko 30 fisadi ahmiyat di jaaegi
 The 40 + 30 + 30 formula has been agreed to be adopted by IIT 2015 when Triple IT and NIT experience well
 lekin sibbal kii ghoshnaa ke baad koching udyog or shiksha jagat main mishrit pratikriya hui he
 Maheshwari says that the intention of the government is good, but the way to achieve the real objectives is not effective
 vyaavhaarik rup main dekha jaae to chaatr tanavamukt hone kii jagah or zyada tanavagrast ho jaaenge
 Board exams have also come under intense competition
 abhibhavakon kaa kharch bhi kam nahin hoga
 Sandeep Gupta, CEO of IIT Graduate and Gupta Tutorials, Indore, says, "this will put a stop to the institutions that have made coaching a fraud
 duusari ore skulon ko bhi ab apni kaabiliyat sabit kerani hogi
 Later this experiment can be done in other fields like medical and management
 ''nai vyavastha ko lekar kai tarah kii ashankaayen hai
 This will only increase the pressure on the students
 jeii main or jeii advanced ke donon paper ek din main hone kaa chaatro par manovaigyanik dabaav rahegaa
 On the other hand, adding 12th marks will be more challenging for students in many places including Uttar Pradesh and Bihar as there is a huge difference in the marks of students of state boards as compared to CBSE and ICSE boards
 alag-alag board ke number dene ke apane niyam hai
 However, how the 12th marks will be given importance, its method is not clear at the moment
 yah bhi kaha ja rahaa he ki yadi nai pranali 2014 se lagu kii jaati to chaatro ko is badlaav ke maddenjar taiyaari kaa paryaapt samay miltaa
 Although Director of JRS Tutorials, Varanasi A
 ke
 Jha says, "students don't need to panic with the new pattern
 board ke vettege ko dekhte hue unhen angreji or vaikalpik vishyon kii shuru se taiyaari kerani hogi
 Trikha believes that the new pattern has both advantages and disadvantages for students
 unke mutabik, 12veen kii pariksha buniyadi kila he or yah majubat hona hi chahie, lekin sawaal yah he ki sabhi alag-alag parikshaon kaa ek pariksha ke antargat vargeekaran kaise ho saktaa he? chaatro kii kshamta kaa akalan puri tarah kaise hoga or alag-alag corcej ke liye ejineering pariksha kaa standard bhinn or ooncha kaise hoga?darasal, medhaavi chaatro ke liye kisi prakaar kii pareshaani se saamana mushkil nahin he, lekin inke alaava duusare chaatro ko apane mata-pita kii ummiden puri karne yaa apane sapane saakaar karne ke liye vyavasthit maargdarshan kii darkaar hogi
 To achieve their goal they will be looking for a perfect destination where all solutions can be found under one roof
 zyaadaatar sarkari or privet skool pratiyogi parikshaon main safalataa paane main chaatro kii zyada madad nahin kar pate
 For this reason, private tuition or coaching institutes have opened up
 jeii main safalataa paane ke liye skool agar apni jimmedaari thik tarah se puri nahin kar sake yaa chaatro kaa vishwaas nahin jeet sake to koching par zyada nirbharta kam hone kii jagah nishchit hi bad jaaegi kyonki pehle to unhen 12veen main achche number laane honge
 Then JEE Main and JEE Advanced will have to be prepared and the challenges will increase for children in rural areas where schooling is not good
 darasal, nae pariksha pattern se sambandhit ye niyam kendriya ejineering sansthaanon main daakhile ke liye tution muhaiyaa karaane vaale koching sansthaanon ke liye nae kaarobaari avasar ke taur par saamne aae hai
 Coaching institutes are preparing to take advantage of this
 koching udyog ke anbhavi sanchaalak maanate hai ki sangathit kshetra ke kai institute pehle se hi 12veen kii board pariksha ko bhi dhyaan main rakhkar chaatro ko taiyaari karavaate the
 Although the teaching pattern will have to change, the study material will also change and the selection of faculty will also be focused according to the changing requirements, but this is not a big issue for a good institute
 darasal, koching santhaan na keval nae pattern se nibatane ko taiyaar hai balki kuch sansthaanon ne to atirikt saamagree kii jarurat ko dekhte hue apni-apni fees badha di he
 It has been seen that as soon as the results of competitive examinations come, there is a glut of advertisements of coaching institutes
 lekin sahi koching santhaan kaa chayan abhibhavakon ke liye tedi kheer he
 In the advertisements, it is tried to show the photographs of many successful students that these coaching institutes have the recipe for success
 gupta kehete hai, ''mahaj ekaadh saal pehle khule koching santhaan apane 70 se lekar 100 chaatro kii aalaa ranking kaa daawa kaise kar lete hai?''darasal, pratiyogi parikshaon main kamyaabi ke liye koching kaa baari-bharkam udyog khadaa ho chukaa he, jisamen sangathit or asangathit kshetra ke santhaan hai
 Maheshwari says, "like a consumer, students should choose a coaching institute
 fees de rahe hai to yah bhi dekhen ki unki samasyaon kaa samaadhaan ho rahaa he yaa nahin
 If not, then leave that coaching
 ''maheshwari ke mutabik, shikshak or chaatr kaa sambandh vyavsaayik ho gaya he
 This is a change in the value system
 sangathit kshetra ke koching sansthaanon main seva kaa str behatar hona sakaaratmak badlaav he
 Students choose the coaching institute where they get personal care
 apni samasyaon ko dur karwaane ke liye unhen bolne kii aazaadee milani chahie
 It should be seen whether they can easily meet the management of the institute
 chaatro ko un sansthaanon se bachanaa chahie jinaki buniyaad pratiyogi parikshaon ke asafal parikshaarthi rakhte hai or jo apni berogari se nijaat paane ke liye koching institute khol lete hai
 When choosing a coaching institute, students and their parents often prefer the consultation of their acquaintances or relatives, but when choosing a coaching institute, one should gather information about its track record, percentage of success of students, level of faculty, etc
 kisi koching santhaan main di jane vaali shiksha kii gunvattta kaa arth he ki jo vaada vah koching karti he, use kitna nibhaa rahi he, kyonki yahi vah factor he, jo aapke liye bhi laabhadaayi sabit hoga
 To understand all these, what is the material taught in the coaching institute, how effective is the method of teaching, how is the faculty, etc
 One should know about important things
 koching sansthaanon kii website ke daavon kii pushti ke liye safal chaatro se unki asaliyat jaan lenaa phydemand he
 It is wise to choose the institute that is willing to help the students to keep pace with the school in terms of time
 koching santhaan kii ore se di jane vaali padhai kii saamagree, hdhactice papers or online suvidhaayen bahut zyada myne rakhti he
 The preparation of any entrance examination of engineering, medical or management starts only after the 10th examination
 lekin jha kaa kahana he ki kaksha 9veen or 10veen kii padhai buniyaad majboot banane ke lihaaj se ahm he
 Students should read each chapter of each subject carefully in both these classes, then try to solve all the questions behind the chapter themselves
 chaatro ko tution ke bharose nahin rahanaa chahie
 If the student learns by working hard then his fundamentals become clear
 yadi chaatr kisi karanvash tution yaa koching ke liye jate bhi hai to teacher kaa padhaane kaa tarika kuch aisa hona chahie ki ve zyaadaatar kaam chaatr se karavaaen
 It is not the teacher's job to make students' work easy by merely providing information or readymade information
 chaatro ke basic concepts acchhee tarah durust hone jaruri hai
 Maheshwari believes that along with the coaching class, parents also contribute to the success of the student
 abhibhavakon ko chahie ki ve bachche kii kisi ke saath tulana nahin karen
 Also, instead of putting pressure on the child, keep him relaxed and keep encouraging the child
 aap apane bacchon kaa yah kah kar aatmavishvaas badhayen ki yadi kisi pravesh pariksha main chayan nahin bhi ho sakaa to koi baat nahin, unke liye duusare vikalpon kii bharmaar he
 Mahesh Singh Chauhan, director of Bhabha Classes, Kanpur, admits that there are only a few children of exceptional talent and most of them want to achieve their goals through coaching
 vakt ke saath teji se badal rahe koching santhaan isi tarah chaatro ke sapane puure karte rahenge
 There is going to be a tough meeting between India and Pakistan in Manchester, England today
 phens ko is match kaa besabri se intjaar he, vahiin barish ke dar ne bhi phens kii pareshaani badhaai hui he
 Nevertheless, Indian fans are encouraging the players of the Indian cricket team in every situation

 Vijay Mallya, the owner of Kingfisher Airlines, left the country on March 2 , when banks filed a petition regarding the matter
 atorni general ne supreme court ke poochne par yah khulaasa kiya
 However, the Supreme Court has issued a notice to Mallya seeking an answer in 2 weeks and asked why his passport should not be confiscated
 sunwaayee ke dauraan court main mukul rohtagi ne kaha ki hamaari sibiai se baat hui he, jaankaree mili he ki maalya 2 march ko desh chhod chuke hai, jab bainkon ne diarti main yachika di thi
 The AG said that this is the money of the public, we want this money back, we do not want anyone's blood
 court maalya ko pesh hone ke liye kah saktaa he
 We also know that Mallya has assets worth crores of rupees abroad, which is more than our loan, however, the Supreme Court asked the banks the question, why was such a loan given when you can recover only one-tenth? The court said that at the moment he is issuing notice to Mallya
 is maamle kii sunwaayee 30 march ko hogi
 The comments darasal, diwalia ho chuki kingfisher airlines company ke maalik or udyogpati vijay maalya ko desh se baahar jane se rokane kii maang ko lekar state bank of india sahit 17 bainko kii yachika par supreme court sunwaayee kar rahaa he
 a petition has been filed by 17 banks in the Supreme Court that industrialist Vijay Mallya has taken a loan of about 9000 crore rupees from 17 banks including State Bank of India, which has not been repaid
 maalya yah rupaya dene ke bajaay landan jaakar settle hona chaahate hai
 Due to this, their fear of sinking rupee is why, confiscate the passport of Vijay Mallya and prevent him from going out of the country
 yachika main kaha gaya he ki maalya debt recovery tribunel yani DRT main pesh hone ke liye jamaanat raashi jamaa karaaen or DRT jald is maamle kii sunwaayee puri kare
 During the hearing, Mukul Rohatgi said in the court that we have spoken to the CBI, it has been learned that Mallya has left the country on March 2, when the banks petitioned the DRT
 AG ne kaha ki ye janata kaa paisa he, ham ye paisa waapas chaahate hai, hamen kisi kaa khun nahin chahie
 The court may ask Mallya to appear
 hamen yah bhi pataa he ki maalya ke paas videshon main karodon rupee kii sampatti he, jo hamaare lone se kahin zyada he, haalanki supreme court ne bainkon se sawaal poocha ki jab aap dasvaan hissaa hi ricover kar paaen to itnaa lone kyon diya gaya? court ne kaha ki philhal vah maalya ko notice jari kar rahe hai
 The matter will be heard on 30 March

 Mallya wants to settle in London instead of paying this money
 isse unka rupaya doobane kaa dar he isliye vijay maalya kaa passport jabt kar desh se baahar jane par roak lagaai jaae
 The petition states that Mallya should deposit the bail amount to appear in the Debt Recovery Tribunal, or DRT, and the DRT completes the hearing soon

 yah skool gair-sarkari he, magar sarkari sahaayta se chalata he
 The Delhi government has two types of government and government aided schools
 nigam or privet skulon kii alag catagori he
 All the thousands of children studying here get free education due to government grants
 shikshakon kii tankhwaah kaa 90 fisadi se zyaada hissaa sarkaar detii he or baaki skool kaa trust intazaam karata he
 The trust has its problems, as the school claims that it neither takes donations for any admission nor donations
 yah jaananaa zaruri he tabhi aap samaj paayenge ki jo kissa suna rahaa hum wo kyon mahatvapurn he
 Ramjas Foundation in Delhi has been working in the field of education for a hundred years
 ramajas college sahit solah skool chalate hai
 These days there is a lot of discussion about environment
 sabhi privet or sarkari skulon main iko club chalate hai
 But whenever the issue comes up in public forums, private schools are seen as stakeholders
 sarkari skool to kahin nazar bhi nahin aate
 We might not even go to the media to see what happens in a government school
 ramajas skool ke vaais principal ne bataaya ki unhone iko-club ko lekar ek yojana shuru kii he
 All the students of the school were asked to bring a photocopy of the pollution certificate and its number from your home and neighborhood
 har chaatr ko teen-teen photocopy laane ke liye kaha gaya
 Parents also got annoyed that they do not have a car, so where to get a copy of the certificate
 phir bhi chaar-paanch sau chaatr certificate kii copy or number laane main safal rahe
 The school said that a few days before the last date of every certificate, remind the neighbor or people of your home that the time has come to get a new certificate
 ham sab bhul jate hai
 Most people continue to drive even after the certificate date is over
 achaanak dhyaan aata he ki nayaa certificate nahin liya, to jurmaana bharna pad saktaa he
 The school told the children that you can use the school phone for this
 vaais principal ne kaha ki ham soch rahe hai ki is idia ko or behatar tareeke se lagu karen
 If all the children bring, then the data of three thousand certificates will be deposited with us
 skool ne chaatro se kaha he ki is kaam kaa number atirikt gatividhiyon ke vishay main joda jayega
 The Vice Principal told that our children all come from poor families
 is kaam ke liye phone kaa istemaal karnaa aasaan nahin he
 Therefore they have been asked to remind their father or neighbor that the pollution certificate is going to be invalid within a few days
 nayaa le len
 It is good that someone thought about it and gave school children an opportunity to participate actively on environmental issues
 is kaam ko karte hue ye bachche pradooshan or paryaavaran ko lekar kitne zimmedaar ho jaaenge
 The comments kitna acha hota ki dilli sarkaar yaa ilaake ke saansad yaa vidhayak apane fund se skool main ek sarkari phone laga dete, jiskaa kharchaa skool ko na uthaanaa pade
 Children keep reminding people with that free phone that the time has come to check your car's pollution
 kai baar achche vichaar sansaadhan or protsaahan ke kaaran dam tod dete hai
 The Vice Principal also got excited with my enthusiasm and started saying that we will do it better
 main bhi suzav dene laga ki chaatro kaa batch bana diya jaae or har batch ko hafte main ek class kaa vakt diya jaae, jisamen ye kaam karen
 This will lead to tremendous development of civic sense within them
 mujhe nahin maaloom ki meraa suzav kitna vyaavhaarik he lekin ek achche kaam ke asar main main bolne se khud ko nahin roak paaya
 However, an idea has been born
 wo bhi ek aise skool main jiske bachche paryaavaran or pradooshan ke sabase zyada shikaar hai

 All the children of Delhi will sit on the phone and not only remind us the date of the pollution certificate, but can also make us responsible

 There must be something new happening in many similar schools
 in dinon paryaavaran kii khub charchaa hoti he
 Eco clubs run in all private and government schools
 magar jab bhi yah mudda saarvajanik manchon par aata he, usamen privet skool hi hissedaar nazar aate hai
 Government schools are nowhere to be seen
 ho saktaa he ki ham media vaale bhi dekhne nahin jate honge ki kisi sarkari skool main kya hota he
 The Vice Principal of Ramjas School said that he has started a plan regarding the eco-club
 skool ke sabhi chaatro se kaha gaya ki aap apane ghar or pados se pradooshan certificate kii photocopy or uskaa number laaiye
 Each student was asked to bring three photocopies
 abhibhavakon ko jhunjhalaahat bhi hui ki unke paas gaadi nahin he, to kahaan se certificate kii copy laaen
 Nevertheless, four to five hundred students were able to get a copy of the certificate and number
 skool ne kaha ki har certificate kii antim tithi se kuch din pehle padosi yaa apane ghar ke logon ko yaad dilaanaa he ki nayaa certificate lene kaa time aa gaya he
 We all forget
 zyaadaatar log certificate kii taarikh nikal jane ke baad bhi gaadi chalaate rahete hai
 Suddenly it is noticed that if you do not take a new certificate, you may have to pay a fine
 skool ne bacchon se kaha ki iske liye aap skool ke phone kaa istemaal kar sakate hai
 The Vice Principal said that we are thinking to implement this idea in a better way
 agar sabhi bachche lekar aaenge, to hamaare paas teen hazaar certificate kaa data jamaa ho jayega
 The school has told the students that this work number will be added in the subject of additional activities
 vaais principal ne bataaya ki hamaare bachche sabhi garib parivaar se aate hai
 It is not easy to use the phone for this purpose
 isliye unhen kaha gaya he ki ve zubaani apane papa yaa padosi ko yaad dilaa den ki kuch hi dinon main pradooshan kaa certificate amaanya hone vaala he
 Get a new one
 acchhee baat he ki kisi ne iske bare main sochaa or schuli bacchon ko paryaavaran ke masale par sakriy bhagidaari kaa mauka diya

 The Vice Principal of Ramjas School said that he has started a plan regarding the eco-club
 skool ke sabhi chaatro se kaha gaya ki aap apane ghar or pados se pradooshan certificate kii photocopy or uskaa number laaiye
 Each student was asked to bring three photocopies
 abhibhavakon ko jhunjhalaahat bhi hui ki unke paas gaadi nahin he, to kahaan se certificate kii copy laaen
 Nevertheless, four to five hundred students were able to get a copy of the certificate and number
 skool ne kaha ki har certificate kii antim tithi se kuch din pehle padosi yaa apane ghar ke logon ko yaad dilaanaa he ki nayaa certificate lene kaa time aa gaya he
 We all forget
 zyaadaatar log certificate kii taarikh nikal jane ke baad bhi gaadi chalaate rahete hai
 Suddenly it is noticed that if you do not take a new certificate, you may have to pay a fine
 skool ne bacchon se kaha ki iske liye aap skool ke phone kaa istemaal kar sakate hai
 The Vice Principal said that we are thinking to implement this idea in a better way
 agar sabhi bachche lekar aaenge, to hamaare paas teen hazaar certificate kaa data jamaa ho jayega
 The school has told the students that this work number will be added in the subject of additional activities
 vaais principal ne bataaya ki hamaare bachche sabhi garib parivaar se aate hai
 It is not easy to use the phone for this purpose
 isliye unhen kaha gaya he ki ve zubaani apane papa yaa padosi ko yaad dilaa den ki kuch hi dinon main pradooshan kaa certificate amaanya hone vaala he
 Get a new one
 acchhee baat he ki kisi ne iske bare main sochaa or schuli bacchon ko paryaavaran ke masale par sakriy bhagidaari kaa mauka diya

 The Vice Principal told that our children all come from poor families
 is kaam ke liye phone kaa istemaal karnaa aasaan nahin he
 Therefore they have been asked to remind their father or neighbor that the pollution certificate is going to be invalid within a few days
 nayaa le len
 It is good that someone thought about it and gave school children an opportunity to participate actively on environmental issues
 is kaam ko karte hue ye bachche pradooshan or paryaavaran ko lekar kitne zimmedaar ho jaaenge
 The comments kitna acha hota ki dilli sarkaar yaa ilaake ke saansad yaa vidhayak apane fund se skool main ek sarkari phone laga dete, jiskaa kharchaa skool ko na uthaanaa pade
 Children keep reminding people with that free phone that the time has come to check your car's pollution
 kai baar achche vichaar sansaadhan or protsaahan ke kaaran dam tod dete hai
 The Vice Principal also got excited with my enthusiasm and started saying that we will do it better
 main bhi suzav dene laga ki chaatro kaa batch bana diya jaae or har batch ko hafte main ek class kaa vakt diya jaae, jisamen ye kaam karen
 This will lead to tremendous development of civic sense within them
 mujhe nahin maaloom ki meraa suzav kitna vyaavhaarik he lekin ek achche kaam ke asar main main bolne se khud ko nahin roak paaya
 However, an idea has been born
 wo bhi ek aise skool main jiske bachche paryaavaran or pradooshan ke sabase zyada shikaar hai
 If the water level in the city falls below, the poor get less water
 unhen pani ke liye ghanton line main laganaa padataa he
 When the air is bad, the disease catches them first and they have to face financial pressure
 ho saktaa he ki yah kaam bade paimaane par bhi sambhav ho sake
 All the children of Delhi will sit on the phone and not only remind us the date of the pollution certificate, but can also make us responsible
 har skool main ek acha khaasaa kol centre ban jayega
 There must be something new happening in many similar schools

 kitaab kaa naamah jeetne ke raste (the Winning Ways)lekhakah harsha bhogale va anitha bhogalanuwadah naved akbarprakashakah westland limitedkeemtah 195 (paperbaque)‘jeetne ke raste’ aapako apni kitaab ke tital ke anuroop hi ek ek baarikiyon ko bataata he jo kamyaabi ke liye jaruri he
 This is a very tasty dish cooked by a cook (specialist) taking care of all the nuances that make your food taste great
 yani is kitaab ko padhane ke baad aap nishchit taur par apni safalataa kii raah main aa rahe adchanon ko pahchaanane main kaamyaab ho sakenge or usase nijaat paane ke liye khud ko taiyaar kar sakenge
 Mukesh Ambani, the number one business man of Amukh India, wrote: Regarding the book, Ambani writes that Harsha has taught us to love cricket and to read this book in the same way as it is enjoyable to listen to his commentary
 is kitaab ke har panne par unhone khel, bijness, cinema ko jivan se jodate hue gyaan kii motiyon ko chunaa he jise is pustak ke lagbhag prayek panne par paaya ja saktaa he
 This book has set the basic rules of winning very effectively
 kitaab ke bare main:yah kitaab lagbhag aath saalon main vibhinn kshetra kii 150 companiyon ke liye 300 satron ke kaam se prerit he
 The book is divided into 10 chapters

 Why this book? 2
 jeetne kaa kaarobaar 3
 Goal 4
 jeet kaa trikon- yogyata, ravaiya junun 5
 The burden of winning 6

 Leadership 10
 aaj kii duniya main chunautiyaan
 These chapters begin with inspiring statements from successful people like Abhinav Bindra, Emil Jatopek, Tiger Woods, Michael Owen, Azim Premji, JK Rowling, Charles Darwin, Richard Branson
 kitaab ke anshah- aaj jeetne kaa matlab he protsaahak hone or nirmam hone ke bich sahi santulan khojna
 Winning sports in comparison to other fields brings happiness not only to those who play, but also to people like us who are fond of sports
 is jeet kaa anand ham bahut baad tak bhi lete hai or baaten karte hai
 - Characteristics of winning teams: happy, calm boys' atmosphere, ability to move the ball, live in the present, plan for the future, take everyone along, encourage underperformers, have a 'can do' attitude , Focus on combat, hunger, passion and energy
 - lakshya pahunch se dur ho sakate hai lekin najaron se dur nahin
 The goal you set for yourself, tells the world what kind of person you are
 gol ke liye taiyaari kar dena bhi utana hi mahatvapurn he jitna ki gol karnaa
 Clarity of role and goal is key to winning
 - jeet kaa trikon he- yogyata, ravaiya or junun
 The difference between a dull player and an agile player is attitude
 jeetna ek manzil nahin balki manjilon kii siries he jisamen nai chunautiyon kaa saamana kiya jaataa he, or un par haaavee hua jaataa he
 We remember Borg, Sampras and Federer, Tendulkar and Warne, Nicklaus and Woods, Pele and Maradona, Jordan and Ali who made it a habit to win
 - mahaan khilaadiyon main avishwasaneey pratibha hoti he, lekin jaruri nahin he ki unamem yahi ek maatr yogyata he
 Without the right attitude, a talented person cannot be a long-term permanent winner
 ek baar sachin shen worne kii round da wicket leg brake gend ko khilne ke liye practice karne main ghanton bitaa rahe the or jab abhyaas maichon main worne ne unhen waisi gend nahin daali to wo or bhi satark ho gaye ki worne unhen yah gend test match main daalenge or hua bhi aisa hi
 When Warne bowled the ball to him in the Test match, Sachin fired him directly above the mid-wicket, the whole world began to admire his talent
 ye sirf pratibha nahin balki dhairya tha
 Effort is wasted without effort
 safalataa kii racippi he- pratibha kaa ek bada chammach lekin ravaiye or kartavyanishtha ke kai bade chammach
 Sachin's friend Kambli also had a lot of talent but after coming internationally he could not show discipline
 nateeja sabake saamne he
 - Success should also be analyzed in the same depth as failure
 jeet said-effects ke saath milti haih ahankaar, ati aatmavishvaas or aatmatushti
 The disease of 'I' can lead to the defeat of 'we'
 kathin paristhitiyaan champion ko chunauti dene waalon se bhinn sabit karti hai
 Symptoms of losing: late decision, arrogance, internal competition, factionalism, giving more importance to credit than completing work, lack of focus, lack of energy, lack of backup plans, blaming others for failure, Absence of thoughts - kuch log swaabhaavik leader hote hai
 The odd thing is that most of the successful players, often, have not been very influential captains - while a successful captain like Mike Brearley or a coach like John Buchanan seemed to be barely the most qualified for the job
 - netritv akasar pechida hota he
 Winston Churchill, who is remembered as one of the finest leaders of the Second World War, lost the election immediately after the end of the war
 yudhkaal main jo mahaan netaa sabit hue the, unhen shaantikalin prabandhak ke rup main nakaar diya gaya tha!- captain yaa coach yani leader kaa kaam team ke khilaadiyon ko acha maahaul bana kar dena he jo vishwaas or sahyog kaa protsaahan de
 In 2002, India, led by Nasir Hussain, failed to dismiss the English team Sachin by throwing the ball outside the leg stumps and denied him a century
 bowler the eshli jailes
 It was a boring task for Giles too, but the captain explained to him that this option was better than allowing Tendulkar to score a century! That is, if a player knows his role and applies it well, a seemingly small role can also become important
 - leaders kii ek antim tithi bhi hoti he
 Ian Chappell believes that you have an inner voice that tells you when it's time to leave
 lekin antim tithi sunishchit karne kaa koi formula nahin hota
 Ganguly remained captain for five years while Dravid felt that his time was over in two years
 isliye niyoktaaon ko najar banaakar rakhni chahie or khilaadiyon kii tarah leaderon ko bhi sahi samay par chunanaa or nikaalnaa jaruri he
 - a good leader is someone who is forward-looking, communicates to inspire, manages the environment, is trustworthy, respected, is supportive of the team, is easy to reach, open, flexible, honest and willing to listen, Be positive, optimistic, willing to surround yourself with better people, be willing to take responsibility and give credit and be the glue for the team
 kitaab ke uttarkathan main cricket ke diggaj rahul dravid ne likhaa he ki team kaa khilaadi hone kaa kya arth he
 He writes - Good players see success very differently and are motivated without worrying about credit
 ek jeet ke liye team main prayek khilaadi alag alag mehnat karata he
 For example, a fielder standing in short leg not only puts his body in danger, but sometimes proves to be the one who does not achieve anything till the end
 aise main kuch player is pojishan ko die jane par mehnat se kataraate hai jabaki kuch puri mehnat karte hai or specialist ban jate hai
 Why read this book: In this book, how to win, if you are losing, how to learn, how to build a team, qualities of leaders and what are the challenges in today's world, it is discussed very closely
 kai preranadayak kathanon ko jod kar jeet, kamyaabi or safalataa par bane rahane kaa nuskhaa bataaya gaya he
 Author Introduction Harsha Bhogle has written this book with his wife Anita
 harsha isse pehle bhi apane orticals ke colections ko ‘out of da box’ naamak kitaab kii shakl de chuke hai

 iske alaava pichley 14 saalon se is danpati ne ek sports aadhaarit kansaltansi prosearch bhi khol rakhaa he
 In conclusion, i would like to say that reading this book is very energetic because each one of us can understand the world very easily through sports and harsha-anita has made it even easier
 yah ek nayab tohfa he prayek unke liye jo khelon ke madhyam se choti-badi har us cheez ko samajhnaa chaahate hai jo unke jivan kii sidhiyon par aage badhane main kaam aane vaali hai
 Why should you be working in any field, you should read this book because it is full of tips from sports examples to management and to reach the top and stay there

 Sinha gave his statement to prove that the CBI acted impartially without any pressure
 sinha ke mutabik ishrat jahaan maamle main unhen jaanch ke dauraan amit shah ke khilaaf koi saboot nahin mili
 Ranjit Sinha's statement has come at a time when the country's politics is hot

 Even though the Uttar Pradesh government is claiming to improve the health system on the strength of qualified doctors in the state, the private driver of the CMO is also treating patients at the Joint District Hospital in Kushinagar district
 hairaani kii baat yah he ki yah driver maamuli dawa dene ke saath hi marijon ko drip bhi chadha rahaa he
 The extent of negligence was seen when a woman who had come into the hospital unconscious was carrying four women without stretchers from one ward to another ward while the hospital has a stretcher
 yahi nahin, jis wardbvaay ko vaardon kii dekhbhaal or maamuli maraham pattee ke liye rakhaa jaataa he ve bhi bemauf hokar marijon ko injection or drip chadhaate hai

 The state government had promised to treat critical illness in its election promise but if the treatment of common diseases is being done in the hospitals of the state with the help of drivers and wards, then what will happen to the patients of critical illness

 Not only this, the wards that are kept for wards care and minor ointment are also injected and drip to the patients fearlessly
 tippaniyan The interesting thing is that emergency wards where doctors should be present 24 hours are also missing from the ward and emergency is going on in the district hospital due to these drivers and ward
 pradesh sarkaar ne apane chunavi vaade main gambhir beemaari kaa ilaaj kaa vaada kiya tha lekin pradesh ke chikitsaalayon main saamaanya bimariyon kaa ilaaj driveron or ward byaayon ke sahare chal rahe hai to gambhir beemaari ke marijon kaa kya haal hoga

 Jayantkumar under his jurisdiction Chief Minister N
 biren singh ke 'dakhal' ko lekar shanivaar ko apane pad se istipha de diya
 The minister had charge of the Health Ministry as well as three other departments
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki mukhyamantri unke kaaryo main anaavashyak hastkshep kar rahe hai
 Meanwhile, sources say that the Chief Minister has reached New Delhi to avoid any political confrontation, where he is likely to discuss the issue with the party high command

 Now one year has passed between demonetisation
 aaj sabase bada sawaal yahi he ki kya notebandi kendra sarkaar kaa sahi faisla tha yaa phir samay ne is faisle ko galat sabit kar diya he?duniya kii duusari arthvyavasthaaon par najar daalen to yah koi pehla mauka nahin he jab kisi desh ne karency sudhaar ke liedimonetigeshan prakriyaaki or uske asar se puure desh main afra-tafari kaa maahaul ban gaya

 In the term of banking and currency, this process is called decimation
 is prakriya ko lagu karne ke liye england sarkaar ne sabhi bainkon ko chaar din kaa vakt diya, jisase nai karency ko puure desh main pahunchaaya ja sake
 During this time all the banks of the country remained closed
 mana jaataa he ki england ne safalataa ke saath apni arthvyavastha se puraane sikkon ko baahar kar diya or kisi bade nukasana kaa saamana nahin karnaa padaa
