 14 agast, 2016 - yah vah taarikh he, jo pakistani team or younus khan ko hameshaa yaad rahegi
 
 
 Although Independence Day is also celebrated in Pakistan on this day, but something special happened this time on August 14, which has been settled in the memories of Pakistanis forever
 
 
 pakistan ke itihaas main yah pehla mauka tha, jab unhone apni azaadi ke din england ko england kii zamin par hi haraaya

 With this, Younis Khan became the oldest player from Pakistan to score a double test century
 
 
 younus khan se pehle yah record zahir abbaas ke naam tha, jinhone aaj se 34 saal pehle 35 saal ke umr main doharaa shatak thoka tha
 
 
 With this double century, Younis Khan has also reached the fifth position in the ICC Test rankings
 
 
 tippaniyan The most interesting thing about this double century was that Younis Khan gave credit to former India captain Mohammad Azharuddin
 
 
 match ke baad puraskaar vitaran samaaroh ke dauraan younus khan ne bataaya ki match se pehle unke paas ascharyajanak rup se bharat se ek kol aayaa, jo mohammad azahruddin ne kiya tha
 
 
 Younis Khan reported, Azharuddin talked to him about his batting technique, and advised him to stop at the crease
 
 
 younus ne yah bhi bataaya ki vah azahruddin kii baaten sunate rahe, or dusron kii salaah par bharosa karne ke swabhaav kii vajah se is par amal bhi kiya, so, is test pari ke dauraan azahruddin kii salaah unke kaam ai
 
 
 Significantly, in the last Test match played between Pakistan and England, Pakistan won by 10 wickets, due to which the guest team, trailing 2-1 in the series, managed to equalize in the series
 
 
 jeet main younus khan ke shandaar dohare shatak ke alaava sohail khan or yasir shah kii badhiya gendbaazi kaa bhi yogadan rahaa
 
 
 This Test match will also always be memorable for Younis Khan, as he scored his first double century (218) at the England ground, at the age of 38, batting brilliantly in the same match
 
 
 iske saath hi younus khan doharaa test shatak maarane vaale pakistan ke sabase bujurg khilaadi ban gaye
 
 
 Before Younus Khan, this record was in the name of Zaheer Abbas, who scored a double century at the age of 35, 34 years ago
 
 
 is dohare shatak ke saath younus khan isisi test ranking main bhi paanchaven sthaan par pahunch gaye hai

 Younis also stated that he kept listening to Azharuddin's words, and because of his nature of relying on the advice of others, he also implemented it, so Azharuddin's advice came to him during this Test innings
 
 
 gauratlab he ki pakistan or england ke bich khele gaye aakhri test match main pakistan ne 10 wicket se jeet hasil kii, jisaki badaulat series main 2-1 se pichad rahi mehmaan team series main barabari paane main kaamyaab rahi

 That is, every day eight farmers are committing suicide in the state
 aise main rajya sarkaar kii yojanaon par sawaal uthne shuru ho gaye hai
 The water crisis in the state is also a reason for farmers' suicide

 ek duusare report ke anusaar rajya sarkaar kii ore se hue karjamaafee ke elaan ke baad rajya main 4500 se zyaada kisaanon ne aatmahatya kii he
 Where the farmer leaders believe that the government is not presenting the correct figures of suicides, there is a claim of full help from the government

 The government could not do this but the number of tankers in the state increased even more

 ' jab bhi mahabharat or shrikrishna kii baat aati he to ankhon ke saamne ek hi cheharaa najar aata he
 That face is that of actor Nitish Bhardwaj
 nitish bharadwaj ne bhagwaan shrikrishna kii murat ko tivi screen par jeevant bana diya tha
 Nitish played the classic role of Shri Krishna in BR Chopra's Mahabharata
 unka ye kirdaar kaaphi pasand kiya gaya tha
 It is also said that in the Mahabharata, posters bearing the image of Nitish were worshiped as Lord Krishna
 actor ko shrikrishna kahkar sambodhit kiya jane laga
 This single role of Nitish changed his life
 unhen sitaron jaisi lokapriyata hasil hui or desh kaa baccha-baccha pahchaanane laga
 On the occasion of Shri Krishna Janmashtami, people will definitely remember the character of Nitish Bhardwaj in Mahabharata
 actor kii popularity ko bhartiya janata party ne bhi bhunaaya
 He was so famous with the role of Shri Krishna that in 1996 the BJP gave him a Lok Sabha ticket from Jamshedpur
 nitish chunaav bhi jeet gaye or saansad bane
 However, he quit politics after some time
 ajtak ko die ek intervyuu main dobaaraa politics main aane par unhone kaha tha- agle pachaas varsh to nahin, kyonki maine ye janaa ki jo main politics ke jariye karnaa chaah rahaa tha, wo to main filmon ke madhyam se bhi kar saktaa hum
 Every person tells me that you don't go into politics
 ab main cinema main hi rahoonga
 View this post on Instagram baad main ravi baswani unhen hindi theatre main lekar aae
 After this, Nitish joined the theater group Aankhen
 actor ne bombai doordarshan main anounsar or news reader kaa kaam bhi kiya
 In 1987, Nitish made his first feature film Khatyal Sasu Nathal Son in Marathi
 iske baad hindi main trushagni kii
 And then he got the role that became his identity
 wo kirdaar tha mahabharat main bhagwaan shrikrishna kaa
 The role of Mahabharata proved beneficial for the actor
 lekin iskaa unhen nuksaan bhi kam nahin hua
 Consider that after the Mahabharata, Nitish got almost the same religious roles
 inamen vishnu puraana, ramayana jaise kai serials main shaamil hue
 Due to the role that gave Nitish a door-to-door identity, the actor's career was seen to be confined to the characters of a body
 haalanki bich-bich main nitish kii ikkaa dukka filmein bhi ai par bade parde par unhen koi khaas mukaam nahin mila
 For the last few years, Nitish is seen playing an active role in acting
 prem shakti, mohan jodaaro or yaksha jaisi filmon main nitish ne kairactor act play kiya
 Nitish Bhardwaj also played Sarah Ali Khan's debut film as a character

 compatrolar or auditor general of india ne sarkari tel companiyon ko par sawaal uthaate hue kaha he ki tel companiyon ne gujarat ke tat par sardaar vallabhbhai patel kii 3000 karod rupee kii pratimaa banane par kai karod rupee kharch kiye hai
 According to the CAG, ONGC, Oil India Limited, Bharat Petroleum, Hindustan Petroleum and Indian Oil have spent this amount under their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)
 stachu of unity ke naam se prastaavit is pratimaa ko banane ke liye sarkaar kii taraf se prachaar kiya ja rahaa he ki – stachu of unity- loha campan-kahani har gaanv kii yani pratimaa ko banane ke liye jaruri loha desh ke kone-kone se aam aadmi dwaara diya ja rahaa he
 At the same time, through an ad film made for this statue, it is also being claimed that iron is being collected from all over the country on this statue of Sardar Patel, the iron man of the country, in which old tools such as shovel, spade, plow etc
 by farmers Is being transported to Gujarat
 stachu of unity kii website par daawa kiya gaya he ki deshbhar ke kisaanon se abhitak 1 lakh 69 hajaar lohe ke upkaran ekatra kar liye gaye hai
 Read this: National status given to Sardar Patel's village, villagers started fast
 It is said that on August 7, 2018, the CAG report tabled in Parliament said that such a huge amount should be spent by government oil companies for the statue of Sardar Patel
 is wrong
 sieji ne apni report main daawa kiya he ki siesaar niyamon ke tahat koi bhi company kisi rashtriya dharohar ko bachaane ke liye siesaar fund kaa istemaal kar sakati he lekin sardaar patel kii nirmaanadhin pratimaa rashtriya dharohar nahin he
 Therefore, any contribution by the oil companies to this statue is against the rules
 sieji report ke mutabik oengisi ne 50 karod rupee, indian oil ne 21
 83 crores, BPCL, HPCL and OIL have contributed Rs 25 crores from their CSR fund on this statue during FY 2016-17
 gauratlab he ki 2,989 karod rupee ke is project ke tahat sardaar patel kii 182 meter kaanse kii pratimaa kaa nirmaan, memorial, garden or shreshth bharat bhawan naam se ek kanvension centre kaa nirmaan kiya janaa he
 Initially, a total budget of Rs 2,063 crore was estimated for this project, but after the tender in October 2014, Larsen and Toubro were given the responsibility of constructing the statue for Rs 2,989 crore

 After Ram Rahim goes to jail, one curtain is being raised one after another from his dark misdeeds
 ab tak kai sadhviyaan balaatkaari baba ram rahim par rape kaa aarope laga chuki he
 'aajtak' has found one such sadhvi who witnessed the sexual exploitation of the sadhvis in Ram Rahim's cave while living in the camp
 yahi nahin, wo khud bhi baba kaa shikaar hote-hote bachi
 He told that Ram Rahim used to drink a special jam and control the girls
 jis sadhvi ke bare main ham aapako bataa rahe hai, wo 1999 se lekar 2002 tak gurmeet ram rahim ke deraa sachcha sauda ke sadhviyon ke ashram main rahi
 On the condition of keeping his name and identity a secret, he told 'aaj Tak' his objections
 padhein puri baatcheet
 
 
 Question - How long did you stay in the camp and what was the reason behind going to the camp? Answer - i stayed in the camp from 1999 to 2002
 uske baad main vahaan par nahin rahi
 i also told my parents that these misdeeds happen in the camp, but my parents said that nothing like this happens there
 hamen kaha ki dere par hi rahe
 Question - Why did your parents send you to the camp? Answer - Our parents said that you will stay there, you will serve, do religious work and will also study
 vahaan jane par meri duty gupha ke aasapaas laga di gai
 Girls were called inside the cave and it was said that you will get forgiveness, but when the girls came out, they used to come crying
 jab ham ladakiyon se poochhate the to wo kuch bhi bataati nahin thi
 Once i put a lot of pressure on a girl, she told everything
 lekin ham sabake maa-baap ye baat nahin maanate the
 When the written letters of the Sadhvis appeared, some of our girls were brought back home by the parents
 ghar aane par hamane apane maa-baap ko sari baat bataai ki gupha main ye sab kuch hota he
 a drink was given in the cave and after that all these things happened
 gupha se hamane cheekhney-chillane kii awaajen bhi kai baar suni
 Around the cave, commandos and some policemen were also kept by Baba, and there were men as well as sadhis who were intimidated
 pitaaji sab ko daraa kar rakhte the
 The brother of a sadhvi was also murdered, due to which many girls were very scared
 ladakiyon ko raat 11 baje gupha main bulaayaa jaataa tha jo ladki unhen acchhee lagati thi usko bula liya jaataa tha
 The girl used to go inside but no girl spoke anything due to compulsion when she came out
 idhar-udhar kii suni-sunai baat sabko nahin pataa lagati thi lekin jab do sadhviyon ne chitthiyaan likhakar sabko bataa diya to uske baad hamaare bhi haunsale bad gaye
 Question- You told that you have been there from 1999 to 2002, during this time, what did you see what happened to the girls and did you ever try to do something like this? Answer- i too was called and where did i go Father had to apologize and i went inside too
 lekin andar jane par jab mujhe sab pataa laga to main kisi tarah se baahar aa gai
 Question- What used to happen by drinking jam? Answer- After drinking, everyone used to own them and nobody could go to the other side
 sirf pitaaji ke hi hokar rah jate the
 Question - Why were you silent till now? Answer - We kept quiet so that it does not kill any of our family members
 kisi ko ye le baithegaa isi vajah se ham chup rahe
 Our family was happy, that's why we considered it okay to be silent, but when these girls raised a little voice, we came out
 sawaal - jab 2002 main chittiyaan baahar ai, tab kya aap ke maa baap ne aapaki baat maan lee thi?jawaab - ji haa, phir hamaare mata pita ne hamaari baat maan lee thi
 The Antony Committee, which investigated the reasons for the defeat of the Congress itself, had agreed to bear the brunt of Muslim appeasement
 isliye rahul or congress gaahe bagaahe apni chhavi main badlaav kaa koi mauka nahin chhodte
 Now going to start UP Mission 2017 from 6th September, Rahul has prepared to enter political battle with new strategy and new style
 siyaasi yuddh main utarate hi yoddha kii tarah agavani kii taiyaarisutron kii maane to,rudrapurki dharti par utarate hi rahul jaise hi janata ke saamne aaenge, to sabase pehle sadak ke donon taraf oonche machaan par ranbheri bajaai jaaegi, dhol or nangade bajenge
 If Rahul goes ahead, then horses will move in the traditional style, then behind him will be the vehicle of today's era
 phir peeche rahul apane kisaan rath main aage badhenge
 Overall view is as if a warrior had gone out in battle
 khaas manyata vaale nath baba ke darshan kar aashirwad lenge rahulrudrapur ke nath baba kaa mandirasthaaka bada centre hai
 According to beliefs, it is also called Dugdeshwar temple
 300 isa purv se zyada puraane is mandir kii mahatta kaashi vishwanath jitani he, isiilie isko chota kaashi bhi kehete hai
 Rahul will start his political battle in UP only after worshiping Shankar ji here
 kaashi se congress ke purv saansad rajesh mishra rudrapur pahunch kar kehete hai ki, ummid he ki, rahul ji yahaan aashirwad lene jarur aaenge
 By the way, the old Congressman says that after becoming Congress President in 1998, Sonia Gandhi made the first political move out of Delhi here and visited the temple, although she came to meet the flood victims
 vahin, mandir ke mahant vishwa ranjan bharti ne kaha ki, pichhali baar rahul aae the to congress netaa akhilesh pratap vidhayak ban gaye, is baar baba se manokamana maangenge to pradhanmantri banane kii manokamana puri ho jaaegi
 After Nath Baba, Rahungalu will also ask for strength from Bajrang Bali, not only this political journey of Rahul Gandhi is being started on Tuesday
 hindu manyataon main mangalvaar ko khaas din mana jaataa he
 Actually, there is already a temple of Bajrang Bali in the ground where Rahul Khatchaupalalga will take place
 rahul unase bhi aashirwad lenge, jiske baad kisaan or khetihar mazdooron ke bich shuru hogi rahul kii khaat chaoupal
 However, Rahul's official programs do not mention his visit to religious places
 darasal, party sandesh to dena chaahati he, lekin dharm kii raajnneeti karne kaa iljaam nahin jhelana chaahati
 After the blessings of God, it will begin after Rahul's forehead bowed in front of Panchayat Uparwale, Rahul will start his political journey
 khaat panchayat ke liye puure maidan par khaat or charpaaiyaan bichaai jaaengi
 Where Rahul will hear the problems of farmers and farm laborers
 sawaal-jawaab bhi honge
 If Rahul Modi bursts the government for not fulfilling the old promises, then farmers and farm laborers will make promises and ask for votes for the Congress
 27 saal se upi kii satta se dur congress ko phir satta main laana kisi chamatkaar ke kam nahin, lekin pike kii nai ranneeti ke sahare rahul 2007 or 2012 kii naakaami ke baad ek baar phir koshish kar rahe hai
 In 2016, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry has been awarded for the development of the world's smallest machines
 jean-pierre Sauvage, Sir j Fraser Stoddart or Bernard l Feringa nobel prise ko saajha karenge
 This Nobel is given to him for the design and synthesis of machines on the molecular scale
 in teenon shakhsiyaton ko sweden ke press conference main nobel ke liye namit kiya gaya
 It is being told that the work done by these three scientists in this field will prove to be very helpful in the future in the direction of creating new materials, sensors and energy storage systems
 Molecular machines vastav main chote anu hote hai
 By giving energy, special work done by them can be done

 Learn some interesting things about Nobel Prizes
 
 
 asal chemist ko mil rahaa he nobel
 
 
 It has often happened that the Nobel Prize in Chemistry used to go elsewhere rather than going to any true chemists, although this time there is no such complaint
 yah fundamental science he lekin isamen smart material se lekar drug delivery tak bhavishya kii dheron sambhaavnaaen hai
 With the help of these structures, they can convert chemical energy into mechanical force
 britain ke teen vaigyanikon ko mila 2016 physics kaa nobel
 
 
 It may be noted that the Nobel Prize is given in the name of a famous chemist, Alfred Nobel
 unhone dynamite kaa avishkaar kiya tha
 Now this will sound a bit strange, but the truth that comes out of the mouth of that old man from a village adjacent to the forest tells us that being a paratantra means so
 garmi ke chalate takreeban suukh chuke ek kuen ke thik baaju main ek ped kii chhaanv tale jab baatcheet ke liye gaanv ke kuch log jamaa hue, to ek vyakti kii nai safed bandi, lanbaa safed gamchaa, jise lungi kii tarah lapeta gaya tha, main haldi se pute sharir or unindi ankhon ko dekhakar hi samaj main aa rahaa tha ki pichhali raat hi unke ghar main vivaah samaaroh hua he
 This turned the conversation towards marriage and by the time it reached how 50 years ago the marriage would have taken place in this village, how much it would have cost, and how people would arrange it, because their father owes a debt for this marriage
 Had to take it from the moneylender too
 yah charchaa madhya pradesh ke satna jile ke pindra panchayat ke ek tole kirypokhari main ho rahi he
 It is a hamlet of 25-30 families settled on the banks of a river
 nadi sukhi he, pehle kabhi is nadi main garmi main bhi pani hua karata tha, lekin pul nahin tha
 Due to the bridge, the processions in the village often used to stop on the same side of the river when there was more water, now the bridge has been built on this river, and the water is missing
 yah majhagavaan block main aata he or majhagavaan chitrakoot ke paas he
 The same Chitrakoot, where Lord Rama spent a long time during exile eating tuber-root-fruits in the forests
 baad main inhen ghaney jangalon main daakuon kaa khauf bhi rahaa, lekin baat na ram kii he, or na daakuon ke khauf kii he
 The matter is about the Buddha Mavasi who has passed almost 70 years, who is telling us that when he had to marry his daughter as a father, complete arrangements were made by going to the forest for just two days
 baat zyada puraani nahin, 40 saal puraani hi to he
 He had done a big job like marriage with a comfortable 16-17 Passerie chiroji
 yakini taur par shaadi or mahangaai us vakt aise nahin hua karti hogi, jaisi aaj he, lekin iske baavjood gaanv ke sabhi logon ko pangat to khilaani hi padati thi
 The forest thus created a trust for this tribal settled near the forest
 thik usee gaanv main ab rajju mawasi ne 2019 main apni beti kii shaadi ke liye 10,000 rupee kaa karz liya he, vah bhi nadi ke us taraf bade logon kii basti ke sahuukaar se
 When we take a loan from the bank, we have to pay 10 rupees for 100 rupees, there is a written account of it, but how the interest of moneylenders goes, we have been reading hundreds of stories in books or in cinema

 Tijoria Mwasi from Kiraipokhari village told us that last year she had borrowed Rs 10,000 from a similar money lender
 unka betaa usee zameendaar ke yahaan mazdooree karata tha, yah ek tarah kii bandhua mazdooree hoti he, or iske baad jab gehun kii fasal nikaalane ke baad usne paanch maheene kii mazdooree maangi to use yah kahkar paanch maheene kii mazdooree nahin di gai, ki uske pitaaji ne karj liya tha, uske badale main vah rakam rakh lee he, jabaki uske pitaaji ne rakam lautaa di thi
 In the face of drought, frost and other seasonal bruises, non-availability of government schemes and challenges of non-compliance of laws, the nationalism of such a troubled India is confined to a limited extent, even its forest, its river, its fields and its animals -not till the birds, who used to make him self-supporting
 isliye hi jab ham mujffarpur main marate bacchon ko dekhte hai, kuposhan ke kahar ko dekhte hai, to use ek ghatana maan lete hai, is par vichaar nahin karte ki ek sakasham samaaj ko dusron par kaise nirbhar kar diya gaya, dedh sau bacchon kii mauton ko bhi usee tarah bhula diya jayega, jis tarah gorakhpur, yaa usase pehle ke anya maamle, jo hamen sachumuch yaad hi nahin aate, lekin vah gambhir chintan or pahal kab shuru hogi, jab ham ek aise bharat kaa sapana dekhenge, jo bacchon kii mauton se mukt ho

 Mahatma Gandhi wrote on 26 November 1938 in Harijan magazine, describing many Jews as his friends, that the demand of a separate country for Jews on the basis of religion does not appeal to me much
 philistin arabon kaa he, jis tarah england british kaa or france french logon kaa he or arabon par yahudiyon ko thopanaa galat or amanviya he
 Not only this, in another article written on 21 July 1946, Mahatma Gandhi wrote - The world has done a lot of cruelty to the Jews
 agar unke saath krurta nahin hui hoti to unke philistin jane kaa sawaal hi nahin uthta
 But Mahatma Gandhi's ideas were before India's independence

 is khat main yahudiyon par hue atyaacharon kaa vistaar se zikr tha
 Also there were many arguments as to why Jews needed a separate nation
 nehru ne kareeb ek maheene tak khat kaa jawaab nahin diya
 Then on 11 July 1947, replying, i wrote - i accept that i have great sympathy for the Jews and also for the Arab people
 main jaanata hum ki yahudiyon ne philistin main bahut shandaar kaam kiya he or unhone vahaan ke logon kaa jeevanaster sudhaarney main bada yogadan diya he lekin ek sawaal mujhe pareshaan karata he

 This thinking of gandhi-nehru remained India's policy until 1992, but the collapse of the USSR in 1991 and India's economic reform opened the doors of relations with the US and it necessitated close American relations with Israel

 unhone kaha ki desh ke kai logon ke parivaar pakistan main or vahaan ke kai logon ke parivaar yahaan rahete hai
 In such a situation, instead of talking about war, ways of reconciliation should be found

 Earlier, Om Puri had said that politics and art should be kept separate, banning artists will not change the situation between the two countries
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki kalakaar gaiyr kanoonee tareeke se bharat nahin aate hai, isliye unhen pareshaan nahin kiya janaa chahie
 In this case, Bollywood is also divided, where stars like Salman Khan, Karan Johar are supporting culinary artists, while Nana Patekar has clearly said that there is no cost to artists in front of the country

 At the inauguration of the 21-acre NSG hub in Mumbai on 23 February 2012, it was claimed that the hub was built to respond to any terrorist attack and plane hijack in Western India, but within months Poll has been opened
 iske udghaatan ke liye tatkaaleen grahamantri pi chidambaram ke saath-saath rajya ke mukhyamantri or grih mantri bhi aae the
 The commandos living in this hub of Mumbai have lost their lives
 hub main commando or adhikariyon ke liye bani rihaayshi imaarat me daraar pad gai he
 Considering the safety of the family, they have been sent to the makeshift building of Marol Training Center of Mumbai Police
 hub se jude commando bataa rahe hai ki yah haalat sirf rihaayshi imaarat kii nahin he balki kuch training imaaraton main bhi daraar kii vajah se unpar hone vaali counter terrerism training roak di gai he
 The nsg's Mumbai Hub squad has 241 commandos and officers

 Sniffer dogs used during terrorist operations are also kept
 kisi bhi special oparation ke liye yahaan ek helipad bhi banaaya gaya he
 It was also proposed to build an underground firing range in this hub of Mumbai
 darasal, mumbai main enesji ke base kii jarurat 26 / 11 aantki hamalon ke dauraan hui thi
 It was then that the NSG commandos took a long time to come to Mumbai from the base of Mansera
 aane vaale vakt main pashchimi bharat main kisi bhi aatanki hamale ko naakaam karne or commando ko kam se kam vakt me pahunchane ke liye hi mumbai hub banwaaya gaya tha
 nsg's Mumbai hub was built by the National Building Construction Corporation at a cost of Rs 56 crore, but the hub remained less for its utility and more for controversy
 mumbai hub banavaane ke dauraan enesji ne lagbhag 80 acre jameen kii maang kii thi jisamen training or rihaayshi imaarat banavaane kaa prastaav shaamil tha lekin enesji kii maang ko darkinar kar maharashtra sarkaar ne sirf 23 eq kii jameen enesji hub banwaaya
 On the other hand, Andhra Pradesh government gave 600 acres of land for NSG
 enesji se jude adhikari mumbai ke hub ke liye di gai jameen ke upar se guzarane vaale power grid ke khambhon par aitraaj jataa rahe the
 According to officials, the safety of the hub is being compromised because of these poles
 is power grid ke khambhon kii vajah se choper kii nite landing bhi nahi karwaai ja sakati
 Not only this, the NSG has to depend on the Mumbai Police for its fire practice
 tippaniyan NSG personnel go to the Goregaon firing range of SRPF
 saal 2010 main marol me tainaati ke vakt gande pani kii supplai kii vajah se kai commando biimaar bhi hue the
 At present, the NSG has asked the IIT Roorkee experts to find out the crack in the building and find out its prevention in the future which may take up to a year
 iske udghaatan ke liye tatkaaleen grahamantri pi chidambaram ke saath-saath rajya ke mukhyamantri or grih mantri bhi aae the

 mumbai ke is hub me rahane vaale commando ke khud ke jaan ke laale pad gaye hai
 The residential building for commandos and officers has been cracked in the hub
 parivaar kii suraksha ko dekhte hue inhen mumbai police ke marol training centre ke mekashift imaarat main bheja gaya he
 Commandos attached to the hub are stating that this condition is not just of the residential building but also some training buildings have also stopped counter terrorism training due to cracks
 enesji ke mumbai hub ke squad me 241 commando or adhikari hai
 anti-terror Operation Commandos have been deployed in Mumbai unit with special counter hijack
 aatanki oparation ke dauraan istemaal hone vaale snifer dog bhi rakhe gaye hai
 a helipad has also been built here for any special operation
 mumbai ke is hub me underground firing range banane kaa bhi prastaav rakhaa gaya tha
 Actually, the NSG base in Mumbai was needed during the 26 / 11 terror attacks
 tab enesji ke commando ko mansera ke base se mumbai aane main kaaphi vakt laga tha
 In the coming years, the Mumbai hub was built only to thwart any terrorist attack in Western India and to reach the commandos in minimum time
 enesji kaa mumbai hub 56 karod rupee kii laagat neshnal building construction corporation ne banwaaya tha lekin yah hub apni upyogita ke liye kam or vivaad ke liye zyada surkhiyon me bana rahaa
 During the construction of the Mumbai Hub, the NSG had demanded about 80 acres of land which included a proposal to build a training and residential building, but the Maharashtra government built only 23 acres of land, NSG Hub, bypassing the NSG demand
 vahiin duusari ore andhra pradesh sarkaar ne enesji ke liye 600 acre jameen di
 NSG officials were objecting to the pillars of the power grid passing over the ground provided for the Mumbai hub
 adhikariyon ke mutabik in khambo kii vajah se hub kii suraksha se samjhauta kiya ja rahaa he
 Due to the pillars of this power grid, the chopper's night landing cannot be done
 itnaa hi nahin, enesji ko apni fire practice ke liye mumbai police par hi nirbhar rahanaa pad rahaa he
 The comments enesji ke jawan esarpief ke goregaanv firing range par jate hai
 During the deployment in Marol in 2010, many commandos were also ill due to the supply of dirty water
 philhal, enesji ne iaiti rudki ke jaankaron se imaarat main hone vaali daraar kaa pataa laga lagaakar bhavishya me uski rokthaam kaa pataa lagane ko kaha he jisamen ek saal tak kaa vakt lag saktaa he

 At present, the NSG has asked the IIT Roorkee experts to find out the crack in the building and find out its prevention in the future which may take up to a year
 hub se jude commando bataa rahe hai ki yah haalat sirf rihaayshi imaarat kii nahin he balki kuch training imaaraton main bhi daraar kii vajah se unpar hone vaali counter terrerism training roak di gai he
 The nsg's Mumbai Hub squad has 241 commandos and officers
 mumbai unit me vishesh counter hijac ke saath anti−teror oparation commando kii tainaati kii gai he
 Sniffer dogs used during terrorist operations are also kept

 It was also proposed to build an underground firing range in this hub of Mumbai
 darasal, mumbai main enesji ke base kii jarurat 26 / 11 aantki hamalon ke dauraan hui thi
 It was then that the NSG commandos took a long time to come to Mumbai from the base of Mansera
 aane vaale vakt main pashchimi bharat main kisi bhi aatanki hamale ko naakaam karne or commando ko kam se kam vakt me pahunchane ke liye hi mumbai hub banwaaya gaya tha
 nsg's Mumbai hub was built by the National Building Construction Corporation at a cost of Rs 56 crore, but the hub remained less for its utility and more for controversy
 mumbai hub banavaane ke dauraan enesji ne lagbhag 80 acre jameen kii maang kii thi jisamen training or rihaayshi imaarat banavaane kaa prastaav shaamil tha lekin enesji kii maang ko darkinar kar maharashtra sarkaar ne sirf 23 eq kii jameen enesji hub banwaaya
 On the other hand, Andhra Pradesh government gave 600 acres of land for NSG
 enesji se jude adhikari mumbai ke hub ke liye di gai jameen ke upar se guzarane vaale power grid ke khambhon par aitraaj jataa rahe the
 According to officials, the safety of the hub is being compromised because of these poles 
 is power grid ke khambhon kii vajah se choper kii nite landing bhi nahi karwaai ja sakati
 Not only this, the NSG has to depend on the Mumbai Police for its fire practice

 Any fall in the rupee not only affects the economy but also creates sensation in political circles
 lihaaja 14 agast ko rupaya jab ek dollar ke mukaable 70 ke manovaigyanik str se bhi neeche gir gaya to congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne twit kiya, 'rupe ne abhi-abhi desh ke sarvocch netaa ko avishvaas kaa mat de diya he or vah aitihaasik nimna str tak gir gaya he
 This indirect comment was made against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who in his campaigning for the 2014 general election, had launched a strong attack on the then UPA government when the value of the rupee fell
 rupye main kisi ek din main ai sabase badi giravat 148 paise kii thi jo agast, 2013 main darj kii gai thi
 This latest decline is due to all the world factors
 phir 16 agast ko rupaya 70

 care retings ke mukhya arthshaastri madan sabanvis kaa kahana he, ''rupe main giravat ek asthaayee prakriya he
 "they believe that this decline is the result of Turkey's crisis and the us-china trade war and its impact on all currencies is being seen
" turki ke khilaaf america paabandiyon ke kaaran turki kii mudra lira main giravat ai or natijatan duniyabar ke share or mudra bazaaron main afra-tafari much gai

 The fall in the rupee against the dollar has been seen for some time
 bhartiya rigerv bank ne is giravat ko rokane ke liye bazaar main dakhal diya or kuch dollar bechney shuru kiye
 However, sustained uncertainty in the global markets, high oil prices and excessive output of capital from currency markets are bound to remain under constant pressure of the rupee
 echesbisi global asset management, india ke mukhya nivesh adhikari tushaar pradhan ke anusaar, ''is saal (asian) kshetra main bhartiya rupye kaa pradarshan sabase kharaab rahaa he (vah takreeban 8
 Has fallen by 5 per cent), but is in a better position than the rest of the emerging markets
 '' ve kehete hai ki yah giravat darasal rupye main kisi kamajori kii bajaae dollar ke majboot hone kii vajah se he
 Experts believe that the rupee will strengthen in the future
 care retings kii ek report main kaha gaya he ki ''rajnatik halake main chal rahi maujuuda uthal-puthal se thodi asthirataa to rahegi or yah is par nirbhar karegaa ki dollar or lira kaa aapasi rishta kya rahata he, phir bhi yah anumaan lagaaya ja saktaa he ki dollar ke mukaable 69 rupye kaa str santulankaaree ho saktaa he
 The devaluation of the rupee greatly benefits exporters
 bharat kaa vyapaar ghaataa paanch saal main sabase zyada badha
 India's trade deficit widened to $ 18 billion in July, largely from 16 in June, largely due to the high oil import bill

 This book is based on Daman's conversation with his parents and the time spent in libraries and archives

 is raste se amarnath dham kii yatra 5 din main puri hoti he
 The Amarkatha of Lord Shiva is associated with every stop from Pahalgam to the sacred cave
 pahalgam main shiv ne choda tha apana vaahan nandiamarnath yatra jis pahalgam se shuru hoti he, uske bare main puranic manyata he ki devi parvati ko amarkatha sunaate vakt bhagwaan shiv ne apane vaahan nandi ko is sthaan par choda tha
 Chandanwadi is 16 km from Pahalgam
 kehete hai ki isi jagah bhagwaan shiv ne apni jataa se chandramaa ko alag kiya tha, jisase is jagah kaa naam padaa chandanwari

 The comments shuruyaat main 519 parivaar the jinako muaavja diya gaya lekin ab badhkar 3500 parivaar ho gaye hai
 In such a situation, it will not be possible to give equal compensation to all
 2013 kii nai policy ke mutabik jin logon ko muaavja nahin mil paaya unako dene kii yojana chal rahi he
 Actually, the land of tribals was acquired for the power plant from 1978, but the petition said that despite the court's order , the government has not taken steps to rehabilitate all 3500 families
 court ne kaha jo bhi prabhavit paksh he agar wo chaahe to hai court ja sakate hai
 The Uttar Pradesh government said that under the policy, 35 crore rupees have been distributed among those whose land was taken for the project
 tippaniyan Initially there were 519 families who were compensated but now it has increased to 3500 families
 aise main sambhav nahin ho paaegaa ki sabhi ko samaan muaavja diya jaae
 According to the new policy of 2013, there are plans to give compensation to those who could not get compensation
 darasal 1978 se power plant ke liye adivaasiyon kii jameen kaa adhigrahan kiya gaya tha, lekin yachika main kaha gaya ki court ke aadesh ke baavjood sarkaar ne sabhi 3500 pariwaron ke punarvaas ke liye kadam nahin uthaae gaye hai

 jab bhi sarkari karmchaariyon kaa vetan badhane kii baat hoti he, unhen hikaarat kii nigaah se dekha jane lagata he
 Like if there is a group of non-government employees
 suzav diya jane lagata he ki inaki sankhya simit ho or vetan kam bade
 From lazy, goth to mccar, the image is created and amidst all this, the announcement of increase in salary also comes as the arrival of an economy
 karmchaaree tamaam vishleshanon ke agle pare main sust padati bharat kii mahaan arthvyavastha main jaan lene vaale agent ban jate hai
 The same is happening today, the same was happening earlier
 ek taraf sarkari naukari ke liye sara desh mara ja rahaa he
 On the other hand, the country is being asked to die even after the salaries of the same government servants
 kya sarkari naukaron ko bottle main band kar diya jaae or kah diya jaae ki tum bina hawa ke ji sakate ho, kyonki tum janata ke die tex par boj ho
 It is like that in a government job, only the workers flourish, but the brothers 'tell me, almost', do not hide behind the doodles in the corporate courtyard
 
 
 ? If the bureaucracy is a group of thieves, looters, then all the Chief Ministers and Prime Ministers of this country should be asked that dear, how are you saying that your government works
 is baat ko kehane ke liye hi aap karodon rupee vigyapanbaazi main kyon phoonk rahe hai
 Someone must be working with you, only then results come
 agar koi kaam nahin kar rahaa, to yah aap dekhie ki kyon aisa he
 Come out and tell that from peons to officers of all ministries, they come and work on time
 iskaa daawa to aap log hi karte hai na
 So why not hornily tell that a large part of the bureaucracy works for more than eight hours
 police se lekar kai mahakme ke log 14-15 ghante kaam karte hai
 People outside the government are very concerned about the size of the government
 ve itnaa hi baari boj hai to dear sabko hataa do
 Just put PM in PMO and CM in CMO, everyone will be done
 janata kaa diya sara tex batch jayega

 People are being hired in all government departments

 Well educated analyst, find out what are the conditions of job of nurses in private hospitals
 unhen kyon kam vetan diya ja rahaa he
 How bad is his condition
 agar aap kam vetan ke samarthak hai to apni selary bhi chauthai kar dijie or baaki ko kahie ki rashtrawaad se pet bhar jaataa he, selary kii kya zarurat he
 It is true in the corporate that the salary is more, but whether everyone is getting lakhs of rupees

 There is a leader sitting on top of it, who asks the DM to recover the money
 jo lut ke har tantra main shaamil he or aaj bhi har rajya main shaamil he
 Otherwise, you can estimate the expenses incurred in the last four elections
 inke paas kahaan se itnaa paisa aa rahaa he, vah bhi sirf foonkane ke liye
 Of course, one part makes the system doodle, so that it can plunder into politics
 magar ek hissaa kaam bhi to karata he
 Our thief politics keeps this system rotten, instigating and provoking corrupt people
 iskaa sambandh uske vetan se nahin he
 The comments rahaa sawaal ki arthvyavastha main jaan foonkane ke liye vetan badhaane kii baat he to sarkari karmchaariyon kaa vetan hi kyon badhaayaa ja rahaa he
 More than one lakh crore farmers' debts could be forgiven
 unke anaajon ke daam badaye ja sakate the
 If the money comes in the hands of the farmer, will the great economy of India refuse to take part

 The Government should not increase the salary of government employee, do not forgive the loans of farmers and students, do not increase the purchase price, then what should the government do with that money

 There is no benefit from the vicious cycle of assumptions
 privet ho yaa sarkari, har tarah kii naukariyon main kaam karne kii ausat umr kam ho rahi he, suraksha ghat rahi he
 It has a bad effect on the social life of citizens

 maamla isliye gambhir he kyonki jo ladkiyaan mokama balika grih se bhaagi thim wo saadhaaran nahin balki mujffarpur balika grih maamle kii gavaah hai
 The question arises as to who is going to drive away the witnesses of the high profile case which is being investigated by the Supreme Court under the supervision of the Supreme Court
 in gavaahon ko bhaagane se kisko phayda hone vaala tha
 Although the police have recovered 6 of the 7 girls from Darbhanga, but one girl has still not been found
 mokama ke shelter home se ek saath faraar hui 7 ladakiyon main se ek kaa abhi pataa nahin chal sakaa he
 Several police teams are trying to trace the absconding girl and are continuously raiding in Bihar, Bengal
 gauratlab he ki 3 din pehle mokama ke balika sudhaar grih se ek saath 7 ladakiyon ke bhaagane ke baad prashasnic mahakme main hadakamp much gaya tha
 However, by raiding the same night till late night, the police had recovered 6 girls from Darbhanga in Bihar
 jabaki police abhi 7veen ladki kii talash main juty he
 The police investigation has revealed that the grill, which was being cut by the institution by cutting the girls, had no power but the girls ran through the main door
 ladakiyon ko bhagane ke peeche kii manshaa kya mujffarpur balika grih cese prabhavit karnaa tha
 The police is investigating the matter, but during the investigation it was revealed that the girls did not want to stay here
 isko lekar lagaataar unka virodh sanstha ke andar chal rahaa tha
 The biggest thing is that the social welfare department of the Bihar government is facing negligence in the girl child case
 ye rishta kya kehalaata he main in dinon hivoltage drama dekhne ko mil rahaa he
 In the coming days, there will be an uproar in the show over the custody of Kairava
 vahiin vedika bhi karthik ko chhodane kaa man banaaegi
 According to Bollywood Life reports, Karthik Kairav's custody will be found in the show
 karthik kaayrav ko lekar ghar aa jayega
 Karthik will also get divorced from Naira
 lekin is sab ke baad bhi vedika karthik kii atension paane main fail rahegi
 When Kairava comes home, Karthik will be busy with Kairava
 wo vedika ko time nahin degaa
 Kairava would remind Karthik again and again of Naira, which would make Vedika depressed
 is sab se pareshaan hokar vedika karthik se alag hone kaa faisla legi
 Talking about the plot going on these days, tell us that Naira sends divorce papers to Karthik and plans to go to Goa with Kairav
 iske baad karthik behad gusse main aa jayega
 Karthik will send Naira the papers of Kairava's custody and the two will fight for Kairava's custody
 sho main ek twist or dekhne ko milegaa
 When Naira will not find a good lawyer, she will fight the case of custody of her child by becoming a lawyer herself
 lekin cese jeet nahin paaegi
 karthik-naira to get remarried? According to reports, Karthik and Naira are going to be remarried in the show
 rajasthan main ek baar phir se donon kii shaadi hogi
 It was here that Karthik and Naira were also married earlier
 haalanki isaki pushti abhi tak mekars ne nahin kii he
 It will be interesting to see what other turns the show will bring in the coming days
 desh main bekaar pade 1,000 arab dollars mulya ke sone ko bazaar main laagne kii sarkaar kii koshishon ke bich sabhi kii nazren aise sone ke bade-bade bhandar rakhane vaale mandiron par he
 However, the operators of many of these temples fear that the melting of gold jewelery and items received from the devotees for the government scheme may hurt religious sentiments
 deshbhar main vibhinn sthanon par samrudh or prasiddh mandiron ke adhikariyon ne is vishay par baatcheet main kaha ki sarkaar kiswarna maudrikarnyojna main tatkaal bhagidaari karnaa unke liye shaayad hi sambhav ho, lekin kuch mandiron ke adhikariyon ne kaha ki yah skim gaur karne laayak he
 However, they too have not taken any firm decision on this
 adalati maamle ban rahe rodadusri ore, kerala main shri padmanabhaswami or maharashtra main shiridy sai baba jaise kuch mandiron ke liye adaalat main chal rahe maamle raste main roda ban rahe hai
 Major temples in Kerala, Karnataka, Telangana and Rajasthan have received a cool response to the scheme, while some temples in Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal and Gujarat have shown interest
 haalanki, inamen se zyaadaatar mandir, aabhushan ko galane kii prakriya main mulya ksharan or mandir ke devi-devataaon ke naam par swarna aabhushan daan karne vaale shraddhaluon kii dharmik bhaavana aahat hone jaise muddon ko lekar chintit hai
 What is Planning and Procedure The ambitious gold monetization scheme launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi last month aims to bring an estimated 22,000 tonnes of gold lying in houses, religious institutions and elsewhere into the financial system
 sone ko aabhushan ke rup main bhi jamaa kiya ja saktaa he, lekin bank use pighla kar uski shuddhta kii jaanch ke baad jamaa aabhushanon kaa mulya tay karte hai
 Somnath Temple Prepares Proposal The famous Ambaji temple among various temples in Gujarat has currently refused to deposit gold for this scheme, while Somnath Temple has prepared a proposal in this regard and the final decision will be taken by the trustees of the temple
 devbhumi dwarka main dwarkadhish mandir ko is par nirnay karnaa he, lekin mandir nyaas samiti ke chairman echke patel ne kaha ki skim vichaar karne yogya he
 Siddhivinayak Temple shows interest The famous Siddhivinayak Temple in Mumbai has shown interest in the scheme and is considering various options to use its 160 kg gold reserves
 isamen se kareeb 10 kilo sona pehle hi ek bank ke paas jamaa kiya ja chukaa he
 The High Level Investment Committee of Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam will meet soon to discuss the issue of gold deposits under the scheme, while there is no plan to participate in this scheme of Kanakadurgamma temple in Vijayawada, Andhra Pradesh
 pokharan kii seat par congress-bijepi kii takkar kitni kaante kii he iskaa andaja is baat se bhi lag saktaa he ki rahul gandhi or yogi adityanath dono hi yahaan aakar vot maang chuke hai
 Now-a-days it is being discussed in BJP and the media covering it that whatever is anonymous in BJP, the same thing happens
 jo zyada charchaa main nahin hota usee kii lottery khulti he or vahi kuch banataa he
 Therefore, now the media should focus on those people who are not strong in the party, not known
 jiske bare main koi soch nahin saktaa ki yah vyakti falana pad par pahunch jayega, vahi kuch naa kuch ban jaataa he
 The modi-amit Shah pair bets on those people whom the media cannot think of or who are out of the public eye
 yah bhi kaha ja rahaa he ki modi media ko galat sabit karte hai
 Therefore, it is in the media that one should think about big people, about low profile faces, instead of thinking about famous names
 vahi ek din nami chahare honge
 The most recent example is NDA presidential candidate Ramnath Kovindka
 dur-dur tak kisi ke jahan main naam nahin aayaa tha ki ye bhi raashtrapati pad ke ummidavaar ho sakate hai
 Whether it was the media or the party leader, no one could reach them, could not think
 media main murali manohar joshi, sushamaa swaraj, sumitra mahajan in sab ke naamon kii charchaa ho rahi thi, lekin naam aayaa bihar ke governor ramnath kovind kaa
 Even before this, even if Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar was there, all sorts of names were playing before he was made Chief Minister
 khatter pehali baar vidhayak bane, phir mukhyamantri bane
 He was known as a low profile leader in the organization
 udhar uttarakhand mentrivendra rawatalo profile netaa the
 Big leaders were being discussed, but eventually Trivendra Rawat became
 jharkhand main bhi raghuvar das lo profile netaa zyada charchit nahin the
 There was also discussion of big leaders about the Chief Minister, but Raghuvar Das won
 bade-bade naamon ke upar ek ke baad ek lo profile or gumnaam chehron ko bade-bade padon tak yaa yun kahen ki front main laakar modi ne nami or bade-bade netaaon ko gumnaam kar diya
 Now the discussion is about whether future governors, ministers in the cabinet reshuffle should not have names which are low profile and which are not discussed
 modi ko jaanane vaale or raajnneetik vishleshak yah maanate hai ki modi jo bhi charchit naam hote hai, uske ulat sochate hai
 This is the reason why Modi always falsifies the discussions happening in media and political circles
 ye baat ab chuphi hui nahin he ki anmol kii maut main drugs kaa ek ahm role he or isi vaardaat ke baad ek baar phir ye baat puure shahar main bahes kaa mudda bani hui he ki aakhir dilli or uske aasapaas ke wo koun se ilaake hai jahaan nashe kii wo khep milti he, jise dhadlle se raat kii partiyon main istemaal kiya jaataa he
 As such, there is no shortage of police in Delhi, the capital of the country, you will easily see a gypsy stationed by the policemen at every intersection and every road
 metro stesan hon yaa dilli kii khaas market yaa phir koi posh ilaaka pisiar gaadiyaan yaa police kii pickets aasaani se dikh jaaegi
 But this presence of the police is just to show like ivory
 sach to ye he ki police ke ird gird hi har dhandha ho rahaa he
 Whether it is drunken settlements or lost discotheques or pubs in the darkness of trance
 ye dilli kaa wo sach he, jisase yahaan kaa baccha-baccha acchhee tarah waakif he
 People who are wandering around the dose of intoxicants know very well which places of Delhi are there, where their search can be ended
 lekin agar koi nahin jaanata to wo shaayad police hi he
 How did Anmol die? Suspense remains on this
 lekin is baat ko to koi nahin jhuthla saktaa ki jis party ke baad anmol kii maut hui, vahaan drugs kaa istemaal hua tha or isi ghatana ne ek baar phir dilli ke us tabake ko jhakzora he, jisaki taraf jurm ke silsile main koi aankh uthaakar bhi nahin dekhtaa
 It is a group of educated and money-rich people
 ye baat beshak chuphi hui nahin he ki rajdhani main kai raisjadon ke sahabjade mahange nashe kii talash main aksar noida se lekar gudgaanv tak bhatakate hue dekhe jate hai
 Many times it has been seen that such wandering people get to know the drug dealers who are well aware of the drugs being sold in the street of Delhi
 conot placepahaad ganjadifence colony marketlajpat nagar marketkhan marketspiviar saketgudaganwanoida sector 18 kii marketye kuch aise thikaane hai
 Where it is often seen the gathering of the needy people who need to get drunk to get drunk
 or inhen thikaanon par pahunchakar unki jarurat puri ho jaati he
 The Directorate of Revenue Intelligence has exposed several high-profile international drug rackets in Delhi several times and seized drugs worth over Rs 2500 crore
 jisamen cocaine, hashish, heroin, charas, smack or ganja shaamil he
 Along with the drugs caught, the police have also obtained party drugs, which are often used in rave party in and around Delhi
 lekin diarectrate of revenue intelegence or narkotics beauron ke sutron kii maane to beete chaar saalon main ek baar bhi alesady kii koi khep nahin pakadi gai
 The big smugglers are doing all this game of drugs for indiscriminate profit
 jaahir taur par drugs kaa cartil dilli main nasha karne waalon kii taadaat badhaata chalaa ja rahaa he
 The condition of drug addiction is that from women to children of settlements, they are intoxicated and there is no one to stop them
 roosi videsh mantralay ne ek bayaan main kaha he ki libya main videshi sainya hastkshep kisi bhi rup main sweekaarya nahin he
 According to the news agency RIA Novosti, French President Nicolas Sarkozy has said that France and Britain are ready for an airstrike on the Libyan army if Libyan ruler Muammar Gaddafi's army used chemical weapons or war planes against civilians
 roosi videsh mantralay ne kaha he, "videshi sainya hastkshep ko khaarij kiya janaa chahie
 "the recent African Union proposal has been welcomed in the statement of the Russian Foreign Ministry
 is prastaav main libya kii samprabhutaa or kshetreey akhandta kaa samarthan kiya gaya he tathaa kisi bhi videshi sainya hastkshep kii ninda kii gai he
 The Russian Foreign Ministry's statement comes at a time when the Foreign Ministers of the Arab League member countries are scheduled to meet in Cairo to discuss whether to declare flying prohibited territory over Libya

 Thousands of people have been killed in the protests against Gaddafi that began on 14 February
 meghalaya main nai sarkaar kaa gathan aaj hone ja rahaa he
 Everything will change in the previous and new government, but one thing will not change and that is the surname (surname) of the Chief Minister
 neshnal pipuls party(enpipi) ke netaconrad sangamarajya ke nae mukhyamantri banane ja rahe hai
 He is the son of former Lok Sabha speaker PA Sangma

 conrad sangamaase pehle rajya ke mukhyamantri kaa naam tha mukul sangama
 There was a Congress government in the state under Mukul Sangma
 ab congress satta se dur ho gai he or bijepi samet 6 anya partiyon ke saath gathbandhan main ek nae sangama kaa netritvrajyako milane ja rahaa he
 The first CM too has been the Sangma surname in the state of Sangma since the beginning
 46 saal ke vidhansabha itihaas main conrad rajya ke 12wein mukhyamantri honge jisamen sangama upnaam vaale vah chauthe siem hai
 Sangma's rule in the state has been around 20 years since 1972
 rajya main pehali vidhansabha march 1972 main chuni gai or ol party hills leaders conference (APHLC) kii sarkaar bani, jiskaa netritv kiya wiliam e sangama ne
 Sangma remained in power with this party from 18 March 1972 to 21 November 1976
 baad main vah congress main shaamil hue or agali sarkaar banaai
 He has been Chief Minister for a total of 3 times
 pita ke baad ab betiske baad pie sangama ke rup main rajya ko bataur mukhyamantri duusare sangama mili
 He became the Chief Minister in February 1988 during the Fourth Assembly
 vah 25 march, 1990 tak rajya ke mukhyamantri rahe
 But after his departure, it took 20 years for the state to get the next Sangma chief minister
 aathven vidhansabha ke dauraan 20 april, 2010 ko mukul sangama ne mukhyamantri pad kii shapath lee or is vidhansabha main siem pad kii shapath lene vaale vah chauthe netaa rahe
 Mukul, who became the CM from the Congress, remained in this position till 2013
 iske baad 2013 main rajya main vidhansabha chunaav hue jisamen unki aguwai main party ne baaji maar lee
 And he remained the Chief Minister for the next 5 years
 mukul sangama rajya main 2 baar siem rahe lekin 8 saalon tak lagaataar satta main bane rahe
 This time too his party performed well and became the largest party in the state by securing 21 seats
 lekin bijepi ke ranneetikaron ne ek ke baad ek aisi yojana banaai jisase vah sarkaar banane ke maamle main pichad gai or congress ko satta se dur hona padaa
 Another Sangma is going to come to power with the new alliance, it has to be seen how long Konrad Sangma stays in this post
 unke pita kareeb 25 maheene rajya ke mukhyamantri rahe the

 The trailer of the film Chhichhore, directed by Nitesh Tiwari, has been released
 film 30 agast ko relies hogi or isamen sushant singh rajput lead role play kar rahe hai
 Apart from Sushant, Varun Sharma, Tusshar Pandey, Prateek Babbar and Shraddha Kapoor are playing important characters
 trailor fox star hindi ke vairiphoid utyub channel par relies kiya gaya he or bahut teji se viral ho rahaa he
 However, there is also a negative point that by looking at the trailer, you miss Aamir Khan's 3 Idiots
 kya he film kii kahanefilm aapako college ke us daur main lekar jaati he jise adhiktar log apni jindagi kaa sabase khubasurat vakt maanate hai
 The story is about some friends who are solid friends in college
 film ko college life kii utaar chadhaav bhari ek roller coster jarney kaha ja saktaa he jo kabhi aapako gudgudati he to kabhi aapako imotional kar jaati he
 There are not many superhit films made in Bollywood on college life
 aisi gini chuni filmon main 3 idiyats or student of da year kaa naam aata he
 Watching the trailer of the film reminds you of Rajkumar's 3 Idiots on a few moments
 inamen ek dost kaa accident hona or baakiyon kaa uski kheriyat lene pahunchnaa jaise seen shaamil hai
 How is the trailer: Looking at the trailer, it seems that Nitesh Tiwari is going to break Rajkumar Hirani's record
 trailor kii shuruyaat hoti he sushant singh rajput dwaara baandhi ja rahi bhoomika ke saath jisamen vah college life kii khubsuurati ke bare main bataa rahe hai
 After this, the trailer takes you to the journey where unknown boys from some different places in college become good friends for life
 sabhi kalakaaron ke acting kaabil-e-tarif he or dialogs bhi achche lag rahe hai
 The trailer may not make you laugh openly, but the dialogues and situations are enough to bring a smile to your face
 jab aap 3 idiyats se nitesh kii chhichhore ko compair karte hai to ek bada fark ye najar aata ki kahani kisi ek singular trek ko follow nahin karti he
 Things are just happening during college life
 film kii jaisi storiline trailor main najar aa rahi he use lekar soshal media par log iskaa majaak uda rahe hai or ise garibon kii student of da year bataa rahe hai
 Nitesh has previously made films like Dangal, Bareilly's Barfi and Bhootnath Returns
 dekhnaa hoga ki film box offis par kya kamaal kar paati he

 During the discussion on the SPG Amendment Bill in the Lok Sabha, political mercury has increased due to BJP MP from Bhopal Pragya Singh Thakur calling Nathuram Godse, the assassin of Mahatma Gandhi, a patriot
 vipakshi dal to unka virodh kar rahi rahe hai lekin ab ve apni hi party ke netaaon ke nishane par aa gai hai
 In the Lok Sabha on Thursday, Rajnath Singh said that if anyone calls Nathuram Godse a patriot, our party strongly condemns it
 mahatma gandhi hamaare liye adarsh hai, vah hamaare path pradarshak hai or hameshaa rahenge
 He said that the thinking that Nathuram Godse was called a patriot should be finished
 rakshaamantri rajnath singh ne kaha, ''nathu ram godse ko deshbhakt kahana to dur, unhen deshbhakt maanane kii soch kaa bhi hamaari party ninda karti he
 The ideology of Mahatma Gandhi was, is and always will be relevant
 ''nathuram godse ko deshbhakt kahe jane kii baat to dur ham unhen deshbhakt maanane kii soch ko hi condemn karte hai
 Mahatma Gandhi is the ideal of us
 ve pehle bhi hamaare maardarshak the or bhavishya main bhi maardarshak rahenge
 His ideology was relevant even at that time, it is today and will continue to be

 The Buddhist religious Dalai Lama visited Arunachal Pradesh on Tuesday amidst Chinese opposition
 west tawang se unke daure kii shuruyaat ho rahi he
 On the visit of the Dalai Lama, Minister of State for Home Kiran Rijiju advised China
 rigiju ne china ko do took andaaj main kaha ki wo bharat ke aantarik maamalon main dakhal na de
 Kiran Rijiju termed the Dalai Lama's visit to Arunachal as religious in its entirety
 unhone kaha ki is yatra kaa koi raajnneetik uddeshy nahin he
 Thousands of people aspired to be religious teachers
 logon kii bhaawanaaon ko dekhte hue dalai lamas yahaan pahunche hai
 Rijiju said - India is an independent country and there is no restriction on the movement of any religious teacher
 'china ko pareshaan kar rahaa bharat'vahiin china ke sarkari media ne kaha ki bharat beijing ko pareshaan karne ke liye dalai lamas ke tawang daure kaa istemaal kar rahaa he
 New Delhi should follow its political commitments related to Tibet
 sarkari akhbaar global times ke anusaar 14wein dalai lamas kii tawang yatra se china-bhartiya sambandhon ko nuksaan pahonchega kyonki china ne dalai lamas ko arunachal pradesh kii yatra ke liye aamantrit kiye jane kaa virodh kiya tha
 "india is using the visit of the Dalai Lama to harass China," the newspaper quoted an expert as saying
 visheshgy ne kaha, bharat ko tibet se sambandhit muddon ko lekar china se kii gai apni patibaddhtaon par khara utarana chahie
 Not disputed Arunachal Arunachal Pradesh dispute also Kiran Rijiju replied
 unhone kaha ki ye rajya vivaadit nahin he
 Rijiju said that India does not interfere in China's internal affairs
 aise main china ko chahie ki wo bharat ke maamle main koi dakhal na de
 The internal matter of calling the Dalai Lama in Arunachal and China avoided interfering in it
 rigiju ne kaha ki dalai lamas arunachal ke dil main basate hai
 He first came to Arunachal
 1959 se ke baad se ab tak log unki raah dekh rahe hai
 The sixth Lama was born in Tawang, so the people here like the Dalai Lama very much
 pehle bhi bhadak chukaa he chinaisse pehle chini videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa geng shuang ne kaha tha ki china dalai lamas ke arunachal pradesh daure ko lekar behad chaukanna he
 Bilateral relations are expected to deteriorate with India's decision to allow the Dalai Lama to Arunachal Pradesh
 iske alaava china-bharat ke simavarti ilaakon main shanti vyavastha bhi gadabada sakati he
 However, India has not paid any special attention to this interference of the dragon
 china dalai lamas ko algaavvaadi netaa maanata habharat ke saath puri duniya bhale hi dalai lamas ko aadhyatmik netaa maanati ho lekin china unhen ek algaavvaadi netaa ke taur par dekhtaa he
 There have been earlier reports in newspapers that allowing the Lai Lama to travel to the disputed region would inevitably create a confrontation, weaken the stability of the region, and create a rift in india-china relations
 unka maananaa he ki bharat dalai mudde kaa istemaal kar kai tarah ke phaayde hasil kar saktaa he

 Explain that on 10 August 2018, it was clarified by the government that there is no proposal to withdraw the 2000 rupee note
 loksabhaa main poocha gaya tha ki kya sarkaar jaldi hi 2000 ke note ko waapas lene par vichaar kar rahi he
 In response to this question, Minister of State for Finance p Radhakrishnan said, 'there is no such proposal
 ’2000 rupee ke note ko waapas lene kii khuspusaahat ko bhartiya rigerv bank kii ore se 28 november 2018 ko jari kiye aankadon se hawa mili
 According to these figures, the currency in circulation decreased by Rs 11,600 crore between 9 November and 23 November
 visheshgyon ke mutabik karency me kami kaa ye trend 2000 rupee ke noton ko waapas lene kii vajah se aayaa he
 India Today filed a petition with the Reserve Bank of India under the Right to Information (RTI) to know the real picture
 is yachika main print kiye ja rahe 2000 ke nae noton ke aankade kii jaankaree maangi gai
 The RBI sent the currency note to the press
 press se jo jawaab mila wo is prakaar he- “uplabdh records ke mutabik, RBI ne karency note press, nasik ko 2000 rupye mulya ke nae noton ko chhapane kaa koi order nahin diya, isliye ve print nahin kiye gaye
 On the information sought on the 500 rupee notes, the currency note press replied - '3565 worth 500 rupees
 500 million nae note bhartiya rigerv bank ko 14 sitambar 2018 tak dispech kiye gaye
 It also said that the printing cost of a new 500 rupee note is 2 rupees 81 paise per note
 care retings ke chif iconomist madan sabanavis ne new indian express ko bataaya, sirf yahi kaaran samajha ja saktaa he ki 2,000 ke noton ko dhire dhire waapas liya ja rahaa he or chote mulya ke karency noton ko print kiya ja rahaa he
 Otherwise, the currency that is in circulation does not fall like this
 ’hamaari artiai yachika kaa jo jawaab karency note press se mila, aisa lagata he ki wo jawaab RBI ke taaja aankadon se mail khaataa he
 This means that the government can gradually withdraw the 2000 notes in complete circulation in a phased manner

 Indian captain Virat Kohli was competing with only two foreign batsmen till sometime back
 ek hashim amala (hashim Amla 27th Century) hai
 And one AB de Villiers has said goodbye to cricket
 abi ne to saarvajanik rup se viraat ko khud se behatar ballebaaj qaraar diya tha
 Hashim Amla does not speak
 chupchaap ran banane main jute rahete hai
 Now he broke a record of Breaks Virat Kohli Record
 or vah bhi bahut hi baarik antar se
 Hashim Amla broke this record in the first ODI against Pakistan (RSA vs PAK, 1st ODI)
 Fifty for Hashim Amla! He has helped lay a strong platform for South Africa, but Pakistan has kept the run rate in check
 At the halfway stage of their innings, the hosts are 118 / 1

 com / 2ze6mgktd8pakistan ne pehle vanade main mejabaan dakshin africa ko chah wicket se haraa diya, lekin isse pehle hashim hi chhaae hue the
 The reason was that he broke Virat Kohli's record
 hashim ne 120 gendon par 7 chaukon or 1 chakke se bina out hue 108 ran kii pari kheli
 With this, South Africa managed to score 266 runs
 lekin viraat kohli ke sabase tej 27 shatak banane ke record ko ab hashim amala ne tod diya he
 Where Virat Kohli scored his 27th century in 169th innings, Hashim Amla did the feat in 167 innings in the first two innings
 kohli ne yah record saal 2017 main pune main banaaya tha
 Certainly this is a big record, but the fans of Kohli are saying that it does not matter to them because Kohli has gone far ahead as a record and batsman
 kohli ke samarthakon kaa kahana he ki hashim ne bhale hi 27waan shatak kohli se pehle bana diya ho, lekin vah viraat ke 39 shatakon ke record ko kabhi nahin tod paaenge
 And this claim also has merit
 amala kii umr 35 saal se zyada ho chuki he
 It is true that Amla has missed the mile behind Kohli in the race

 pesh he is baatcheet ke pramukh ansh:shriman videsh mantri ji, pakistan ko alag-thalag karne ke liye aapane dabaav kii kootneeti apanaai lekin usase phayda nahin ho rahaa
 You seem to have lost the diplomatic battle against Pakistan
 dabaav jaise shabdon ke prayog main main yakeen nahin karata
 This is not a diplomatic battle, but diplomacy
 yahaan par mudda he-bhavishya main hamale rokane ke liye aatankwaad ke khilaaf prabhavi karrwai or aatankwaad ke buniyadi dhaanche ko khatm karnaa
 The perpetrators of terror and its victims definitely need to be looked at from a different perspective
 ham vahi sab kar rahe hai jo aise halaat ke baad koi bhi jimmedaar desh karata
 But what is your limit? Will you wait for the next attack to take action? No, it will not
 aapako samajhnaa chahie ki kootneeti main samay lagata he
 It is not a quick way that anyone has ever burnt or extinguished the switch
 kabhi-kabhi is prakriya main deree ho sakati he lekin ise aajmaana jaruri hota he
 Sometimes you seem to have outsourced your diplomacy to America and the West
 yah sahi nahin he
 We are telling everyone that you should put pressure on Pakistan because it is not just a matter of india-pakistan relations
 aise muddon ko is rishte ke nazariye se dekhne kii jarurat nahin he
 Actually, they are part of global terrorism and should be combated together
 aapane unako 40-50 pannon ke saboot saunpe hai or iske baavjood unke raashtrapati kehete hai ki yah mahaj soochna he
 i must tell you clearly that Pakistan is still doing nothing
 soochna saboot ke aadhaar par hi ikattha kii gai
 When a crime occurs, the first thing that is done is that the police register an FIR
 iske baad hi jaanch-padtaal kii jaati he
 We have not only given them information but have also provided material on the basis of which they can investigate further

 Although the NCP had announced unconditional support to the minority BJP government in the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly, on Tuesday, party chief Sharad Pawar said that the stability of the state government was not the responsibility of the NCP
 unhone party kaaryakartaaon se madhyavadhi chunaav ke liye taiyaar rahane ko bhi kaha tha
 In an editorial published in the Sena mouthpiece 'saamana', Sharad Pawar is taking advantage of this unstable government, but the Shiv Sena will stand firmly here
 pavaar jo chahen, karne do
 The Shiv Sena is playing its role as an opposition party with honesty and integrity
 shivasena ne aarope lagaaya ki pavaar avishvaas kii raajnneeti karne ke liye jane jate hai, isiilie pehle unhone bijepi ko samarthan diya or ab ise waapas lene kii dhamkee de rahe hai
 The Shiv Sena said, Pawar thinks that he can do politics as per his wish and reverse the political situation
 vah apane 41 vidhayakon ke saath nai sarkaar ke bhavishya ko apane haathon main rakhana chaahate hai
 His politics rests on an unstable government, but the picture he presents of the current political situation is ridiculous
 isane kaha ki pavaar ke shabdon ko gambhirtha se nahin liya janaa chahie, kyonki vah kehete kuch hai, karte kuch or hai, yah unki aadat he
 Angered by Narendra Modi's accusation of not visiting the border during the conflict with Pakistan and China, NCP chief Sharad Pawar on Friday retaliated by saying that he visited the world's highest battlefield Siachen to boost the morale of the troops
 He was the first defense minister to do so
 pavaar ne pradhanmantri ke aarope kaa khandan karte hue kaha, 'modi ne sawaal kiya tha ki kya main rakshaamantri rahete seemaa par gaya tha
 i humbly request him to ask for information about my visits from the Ministry of Defense
 ' unhone kaha, 'siachin sabase mushkil kshetra he jahaan oxigen kii kami he
 i was the first Defense Minister to visit Siachen to boost the morale of the soldiers there
 ' Addressing an election rally in Nashik district, he said, 'have you been to Siachen? Do at least one easy job, give the country a full-time defense minister
 ek purnakalik rakshaamantri hona kya rashtriyahit main nahin he?' Pawar has earlier criticized Modi for holding a series of election rallies in Maharashtra despite repeated violations of the ceasefire and killing of civilians in Pakistan
 modi ne kal rakanpa netaa ko rakshaamantri ke taur par unke kaarykaal ko lekar nishane par liya tha
 Modi had said at an election rally held in Baramati, "when you (pawar) were the defense minister there was a problem on the border with Pakistan and China
" kya aapane tab seemaa par jane kaa ksht uthaaya tha?' Pawar said, 'the leadership of the country does not consider it important to protect people's lives
 unke liye ek vidhayak adhik mahatvapurn he
 He said, "pakistan is attacking us every day and killing five to 10 people every day
" ' The country's stock markets saw a spurt in initial trading on Tuesday

 pan se aadhaar link karne main kuch hi ghante bache hai
 But since Friday morning, the income tax website is down, from where it has to be linked
 logon ko pareshaani ho rahi he
 Many people have complained when they are going to the website to link, then there is a problem like technical error, time out

 In such a situation, consumers are worried even on the last date of linking Aadhaar and PAN
 ek or tarika bhi hepan ko aadhaar se link karne kaa ek or tarika bhi he
 You can link your Aadhaar and PAN through SMS
 SMS karen: tip UIDPAN spes (12 ankon kaa aadhaar number) spes (10 ankon kaa pan) or bhej den 567678 or 56161 par
 Why linking Aadhaar PAN is necessary? From July 1, it will be mandatory to give a 12-digit Aadhaar number to file income tax returns and obtain a new PAN number
 aadhaar ke jariye milane vaali biometric suvidha se tex vibhaag ko tex farjivada pakadaney main aasaani hogi
 At the same time, the problem of tax evasion and more than one PAN number can also be curbed
 gauratlab he ki aadhaar kisi kii pahchaan sthapit karne ke liye pan se adhik vyapak he
 Therefore, after combining these two, there will be an increase in the ability of the tax department to collect data and understand it
 is linking ke baad desh main aam aadmi dwaara kharch kiye ja rahe paise kaa puraa aankada tex vibhaag ke paas pahonchega jisase vah tex sambandhi nae niyam kanoon bana sakegaa
 Its big advantage will be in increasing the tax base in the country

 On the 73rd day in the house of 'bigg Boss', Swami Om tried to do his own arbitrariness, though he did not succeed and due to this the family members were also angry
 din kii shuruyaat 'mast bahaaron kaa main aashiq' gane se hui
 The storm task continued for the second day, with the first storm of the day being disqualified from the Bani j task
 iske thik baad swami om ek baar phir iglu ke baahar stool lagaakar baith gaye
 During this time, he has also been talking to the camera that if he is old and will stay away, he will not be able to enter Igloo
 swami om kii harkaton se naaraaz rohan mehara ne tay kiya ki vah unhen task main aage nahin jane denge
 For this, he sat a stool in front of Swami Om in such a way that Swami Om could not enter into Igloo
 iske baad garmi lagane kii baat kehete hue unhone apane kashmiri kapade kaa loar utaar diya or aise hi baith gaye
 This act of Swami Om surprised all the family members
 baad main manavir ke kehane par unhone kapade waapas pahane
 Meanwhile, Bani j started fighting with her friend Gaurav Chopra over the fact that he did not wait for her to eat
 is par gaurav ne bani se kaha ki unhen itani choti si baat kaa mudda nahin bananaa chahie
 At the end of the show, the two once again had a debate
 tippaniyan When Rohan and Swami did not get up in front of Om Igloo for a long time, 'bigg Boss' sent a letter and instructed Lopa to make a big 'D' with the help of the spray sent with the letter and instructed that the storm No member will enter inside that 'D' before arriving
 is dauraan jab lopa ne swami om se kaha ki vah apane pair nishaan se baahar rakhen to vah unase bhi ladane lage
 After this, when the storm came, all the members entered inside Igloo but the family members were not able to decide whether Lopa entered Igloo or Swami Om
 gharavaalon kii samasya kaa samaadhaan karte hue 'big bos' ne kaha ki iglu main swami om sabase baad main ghuse the isliye vah task se disqalifai kiye jate hai
 Om Swamy was angered by this decision and started accusing 'bigg Boss' of being discriminated against, he even started saying that he would talk to Salman Khan about this on Weekend Ka Vaar
 din main jab teesri baar tufaan aayaa tab manu, manavir or rohan iglu main ghus gaye jabaki lopamudra baahar hi rah gayi
 After this Manveer told Manu that he wanted to give him a birthday gift and so he would let him and Rohan in and go on their own later
 is par manu ne unhen samajhaayaa ki game ko game kii tarah hi khelen or donon saath andar jaaenge
 Even after being out of the task, Swami Om did not desist from playing his dirty game, he stood near Igloo's entrance
 jab tufaan aayaa to unhone iglu ke andar jate rohan kaa collar pakadakar unhen baahar khinchne kii koshish kii
 However, Manu Punjabi could not enter Igloo in time and got out of the task
 iske baad swami kii is harakat ke liye gharavaalon ne unhen jamkar fatkaar lagaai or kaha ki isse rohan ko chot lag sakati thi
 The day ended with Manu Punjabi's birthday celebration
 unke liye unki garlfriend piku ne kek bheja tha jise unhone sabake saath milakar kaata
 In tomorrow's episode, we will see that the final match of captaincy will be between Rohan and Manveer and in this match also Swami will be seen doing actions against Om Rohan
 ab yah dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki ghar kii captaini rohan ko milti he yaa manavir ko
 Angered by Swami Om's antics, Rohan Mehra decided that he would not let him go ahead in the task
 iske liye vah swami om ke thik saamne stool lagaakar is tarah baith gaye ki swami om iglu main na ghus saken
 After this, while speaking of heat, he removed his Kashmiri cloth and sat down like that
 swami om kii is harakat ne sabhi gharavaalon ko chaunkaa diya
 Later, on Manveer's request, he put his clothes back on
 is bich bani je apane dost gaurav chopra se is baat par ladane lageen ki unhone khaane ke liye unka intjaar nahin kiya
 At this, Gaurav told Bani that he should not make the point of such a small thing
 sho ke ant main donon ke bich ek baar phir bahes ho gai
 The comments jab kaaphi der tak rohan or swami om iglu ke saamne se nahin uthe tab 'big bos' ne ek chitthee bheji or lopa ko nirdesh diya ki chitthee ke saath bheje gaye spray kii madad se vah ek bada 'D' banaaen or nirdesh die ki tufaan aane se pehle koi bhi sadsy us 'D' ke andar nahin jayega
 During this time when Lopa asked Swami Om to keep his feet out of the mark, he started fighting with them too
 iske baad jab tufaan aayaa to sabhi sadsy iglu ke andar ghuse lekin gharavaale yah tay nahin kar paa rahe the ki iglu main lopa aakhri main ghusin yaa swami om
 Solving the problems of the family, 'bigg Boss' said that Swami Om had entered the latter at Igloo, so he is disqualified from the task
 is faisle se om swami naaraaz ho gaye or 'big bos' par bhedbhaav karne kaa aarope lagane lage, vah yah bhi kehane lage ki weekend kaa waar main vah salmaan khan se is bare main baat bhi karenge
 When the storm came for the third time in the day, Manu, Manveer and Rohan entered into Igloo while Lopamudra remained outside
 iske baad manavir ne manu se kaha ki vah unhen janmdin kaa gift dena chaahate hai or isliye vah unhen or rohan ko andar jane denge or khud baad main jaaenge
 At this, Manu explained to them that play the game like a game and both would go in together
 task se baahar hone ke baad bhi swami om apana ganda khel khilne se baj nahin aae, vah iglu ke entress ke paas khadey ho gaye
 When the storm came, he grabbed the collar of Rohan going inside Igloo and tried to pull him out
 haalanki manu punjabi samay rahete iglu main nahin ghus paae or task se baahar ho gaye
 After this, the family members reprimanded him for Swami's actions and said that this could have hurt Rohan
 din kaa ant manu punjabi ke berthde celibrasion ke saath hua
 His girlfriend Piku sent him a cake which he cut together with everyone
 kal ke episod main ham dekhenge ki captaini kaa final muqabla rohan or manavir ke bich hoga or is mukaable main bhi swami om rohan ke khilaaf harakatein karte dikhenge
 Now it will be interesting to see whether Rohan gets the captaincy of the house or Manveer

 beete hafte weekend kaa waar par 'big bos 13' kaa pehla alimination hua, jisamen contestant dalajit cor or actress koena mitra (koena Mitra) ko ghar chhodkar janaa padaa
 Actress Koena Mitra gave the first interview to the Times of India after exiting 'bigg Boss 13'
 is intervyuu main unhone 'big bos 13' ke safar se judi kai khasabaaten bataayin
 But the surprising thing is that during the interview, Koena Mitra also accused the show's host Salman Khan
 unhone kaha ki salmaan khan ne unki baat na to suni or na hi unhen apni baat rakhane kaa mauka diya
 Talking about 'bigg Boss 13', Koena Mitra said at the time of the interview, "I am very disappointed with the show, i feel that my story was not presented properly in the weekend episode 
 meri kahani nahin suni gai
 Host Salman Khan was taking and defending the contestant Shahnaz Gill's side
 jab wo host hai to unka kaam he ki vah hamen prastut karen or donon taraf kii baton ko sunen
 When i came out, i felt that the audience is also noticing the same thing that i was doing in 'bigg Boss'
 do din ho gaye hai, lekin log ab bhi yahi baaten kar rahe hai ki meri baat nahin suni gai
 As Shahnaz criticized me, made fun of my face and acting skills
 iske baavjud salmaan khan ne kaha ki log ise pasand kar rahe hai, lekin mujhe bataao ki kitne padhe-likhe log ise pasand kar rahe hai
 "koena Mitra) continued," As soon as i left the show, i realized that nobody liked it
 log isaki aalochana kar rahe hai
 So how could Salman Khan not find out the right thing
 vah aisa kaise kah sakate hai ki yah sab ek sahi tareeke main hua
 Why one person makes fun of another person behind his back
 sabhi maamalon main main uski senior hum or usase zyada kaam kiya he
 So far there is no credibility associated with Shehnaaz, even people have seen her on screen for the first time through 'bigg Boss 13'
 vah uske bare main jaanate tak nahin the
 i don't think anyone other than Salman Khan would have liked Shahnaz's acting and would have liked it

 CRPC kii dhara 432 main die gaye centre sarkaar kii salaah ke kya myne hai?kya iskaa matlab centre sarkaar kii manjuuri he
 Does life imply full life and the prisoner cannot be released by pardon
 kya supreme court aise kaidiyon ke liye nai shrenee bana saktaa he jinaki sajaa faansee se ghataakar umrakaid kar di gai ho
 Will he have to spend his entire life in jail without apology? agar maafee ke aadhaar par rihaai kerani ho to ye adhikaar centre sarkaar ko hona chahie yaa rajya sarkaar ko
 In fact, the constitutional bench of the Supreme Court is hearing the petitions filed against the decision of the Tamil Nadu government to release all the convicts who are relieved of death sentence in the Rajiv Gandhi murder case
 rajya sarkaar ne rajeev gandhi hatyakand main maut kii sajaa se raahat paane vaale sabhi doshiyon santhan, murugan, perarivalan or umrakaid kii sajaa kaat rahe nalini shriharan, robert paayas, ravichandran or jayakumar ko reeha karne kaa aadesh diya tha
 The comments lekin iske khilaaf centre sarkaar ne supreme court main yachika daakhil kar kaha tha ki maamle kii jaanch sibiai ne kii thi or is cese main kendriya kanoon ke tahat sajaa sunai gai
 In such a situation, the center has the right to release
 supreme court ne jayalalita sarkaar ke faisle par roak lagaakar maamle ko 5 jajon kii samvidhan peeth ko bhej diya tha
 The court had issued notices to all the states and sought answers and ordered not to release the prisoners of life imprisonment till the verdict comes

 But the Central Government had filed a petition in the Supreme Court against this, saying that the case was investigated by the CBI and in this case sentenced under the central law
 aise main reeha karne kaa adhikaar centre kaa he
 The Supreme Court stayed the decision of the Jayalalithaa government and sent the case to the constitution bench of 5 judges
 court ne saare rajyon ko notice jari kar jawaab maanga tha or faisla aane tak umrakaid ke kaidiyon ko reeha naa karne ke aadesh die the
 a Constitution Bench headed by Chief Justice will decide
 
 
 kya raashtrapati yaa rajyapal yaa supreme court dwaara faansee kii sajaa ko umrakaid main badalane par rajya sarkaar kisi kii sajaa ko maaf kar reeha kar sakati he
 What is the meaning of Central Government's advice given in Section 432 of CRPC? Does it mean Central Government approval
 kya umrakaid kaa matlab puri umr he or kaidi ko maafee dekar reeha nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Can the Supreme Court create a new category for such prisoners whose punishment has been reduced from execution to life imprisonment
 kya unhen bina maafee puri umr jail main kaatani hogi
 If released on the basis of amnesty, then the central government or the state government should have these rights

 "he added," This is not from our personal acquisition but because of my passion and enthusiasm for the film
 "ye deepika padukon or ranvir singh kii shaadi ke baad saath main pehali film hogi
 Deepika said about this, "when you are in the business of films, then you are playing a character

 england ke purv ampire diki bird kii sarvakalik test ekadash main don breadman aurasachin tendulkarjaise mahaan ballebaajon ko shaamil nahin kiye jane se bhartiya cricket jagat hairaan he
 Some former cricketers have even described Bird's combination as 'discriminatory' and 'unbalanced'
 is vivaadaaspad team main purv captain sunil gavaskar ke rup main ekmaatr bhartiya ko jagah mili he jabaki pakistan ke olerounder imran khan ko iskaa captain banaaya gaya he
 Apart from Tendulkar and Bradman, great batsmen such as Brian Lara and Ricky Ponting and West Indies giants Malcolm Marshall, Andy Roberts, Joel Garner and Michael Holding have also not found a place in Bird's team
 apane 80wein janmdin se purv die ek intervyuu main bird ne jis team ko chunaa uske anya sadsy bairi richards, vivian richards, greg chapel, greem pola, gairi sobers, ellen naat, shenworn, denis lily or lans gibs shaamil hai
 Former India captain Ajit Wadekar believes that Gavaskar is the right choice for the opener but he is surprised by the lack of space for Tendulkar, Bradman and West Indies fast bowlers
 wadekar ne kaha ki isamen thodaa bhedbhav he
 They have chosen only those players whom they have observed closely but the combination is not balanced
 gavaskar ko vahaan hona hi chahie tha lekin sachin tendulkar, don breadman or westeindies ke tej gendbaajon kaa nahin hona hairaani bharaa he
 Wadekar said who would share the new ball with Lily
 yah bhi hairaani bharaa he ki bharat kii bishan bedi, irapalli prasanna, bies chandrashekhar or aar venkatraghavan kii bharat kii star spin chaukadi main se bhi kisi ko nahin chunaa gaya he
 The selection of Adam Gilchrist over Ellen Nate would have been ideal
 bharat ke purv ballebaaj chandu borde ne kaha ki tendulkar or breadman ko shaamil nahin karnaa darshata he ki bird ki cricket kii jaankaree kisi thi
 Borde said that this is his own perspective
 nishchit taur par usne breadman ko khelte hue nahin dekha hoga
 From this team you can see how his cricket information was
 aankade aapako breadman or tendulkar ke bare main baatenge
 One does not need to pay attention to his playing eleven
 mere najariye se england kii media ne bird ko mahaan ampire banaaya
 He always discriminated
 purv bhartiya captain nari kontractor hairaan hai ki bird ne kisi aadhaar par team chuni ki isamen tendulkar or breadman jaise khilaadiyon ko jagah nahin mili
 The contractor said that this is a personal point of view but i do not know on what basis he chose the team
 ham sabhi ko breadman or tendulkar ke bare main pataa he
 Apart from these, the West Indies fast bowling quartet (michael Holding, Colin Kraft, Joel Garner and Andy Roberts) are also not included
 purv bhartiya captainon dilip vengsarakar or krishnamachari shrikant ne is par pratikriya karne se inkaar kar diya

 Hmm


 a lot of people
 in sabko main jaanata hoon
 Just had not seen here for many years
 yahan aana bhi kyon chahie tha inhen
 This is not a complaint
 sabaki apni duniya he
 One big and one small
 badi sabake saath sabake saamne
 One with his own little one in front of him
 unki duniya kaa canvas bada he
 i too am living in my small world
 badi duniya main bahut lambaa jiya
 Today, in the small world, i just rewind every moment spent in the big world
 aap khush nahin hai kya, sab aapako itnaa bada sammaan dene aaye hai
 Happy? What does happiness or sorrow mean at this stage of age today? sab vaisaa hi ghat rahaa he jaise hameshaa ghatata aayaa he
 Only the faces are different
 mujhe pataa nahin ki maine kya alag kiya
 What did i get if i separated ant hi to he jo antim satya he
 Is permanent
 atal he
 Everyone gets the same
 meri baaten sun kar tum niraash naa hona
 i do not speak now
 ye umr mujhe shant kar gayi he
 i have screamed a lot, i am very excited in people
 tab meraa role vahi tha
 i played my role
 ab ye zabaan kii shaanti nahin he, ye man kii shaanti he
 What have i got by speaking? kiski zindagi badal paaya
 Probably just yours
 kai baar sochataa hoon ki agar zindagi main ye naa karata to kya karata
 When i think that i would do something else, my mind gets upset
 kaash kuch or bhi kar ke dekh saktaa
 But in a short time, Virathi runs like blood in a numb body
 sab parivaar vaale khush hai dekhiye
 
 
 
 haan, ab yahi meri viraasat he inke liye
 a few days later i would not know what i found, what was lost, what was left
 main jaanata hoon ki in dinon main apane aas-paas ke logon ko pahchaan nahin paata
 But this condition has not happened yet
 zindagi bhar in logon ko dekh kar yahi sochataa rahaa ki kya inhen pahchaan paaya hoon
 How false i found them, how much i found them hiding
 aaj ye sochna mushkil sa ho rahaa he ki ye mere liye aaye hai
 Is this even part of any politics? shaayad zyaada soch rahaa hoon
 i have come for some purpose, what difference does it make to me
 meraa naam amar bhi ho gaya to mujhe kya pataa chalegaa marane ke baad
 i have seen that when someone in the family becomes very old, the family members celebrate his life
 logon ko bulaate hai, khaanaa khilaate hai taaki boodha insaan marane se pehle dekh le apane marane kaa samaaroh
 Today something like that is being felt
 samaj nahin aa rahaa ki kya chubh rahaa he aapako? This is all right in its place
 ye sammaan vagairah
 But how do i tell them to remove some of my regrets
 main inase kaise kahoon ki ant main choti duniya main aana he, apane saath pachhataavon kaa pulinda naa lekar aana
 The weather in this room does not change
 is kamare main koi saathi nahin aata
 Eventually you will be the one who is sitting inside
 usee se ghanton baaten hongi
 Neither of them will sleep
 us charam seemaa par pahunch jaaoge jahaan se phir sab bhuulane lagoge
 As the heat reaches its peak and it rains
 main phir shunya ho jaataa hoon
 i know, I'm going to be zero again

 Never consider your enemy weak or small, as in the case of Hanuman, you have forgotten
 5

 The ministry said in a statement that it will request the finance ministry to allow the company to borrow from external commercial borrowings for working capital under special arrangements
 mantralay kaa maananaa he ki company ke band hone se vimaanan kshetra ko gaharaa jhatka lagegaa

 haalanki company ko yah raahat is shart par milegi vah yathashighra isamen puunji lagaaegi

 mantralay ke anusaar, ‘bhartiya bainkon se pravartakon ke aashwaasan par rin aadhaarit kaaryshil puunji diye jane kaa anurodh kiya ja saktaa he
 Banks and financial institutions will provide loans up to Rs 600 crore on the personal guarantee of the chairman of spicejet

 It will take eight weeks to get the investment

 - input bhashaa se In the scorching sun, outside Uttar Pradesh Public Service Commission's gate located in Allahabad, there was a line of candidates coming for interviews for different examinations
 andar kadi suraksha ke bich baithe ayog ke sachiv anil kumaar yadav ne pichley ek saal se ayog kii gatividhiyon par uth rahe sawaalon ke bare main pehali baar india today ke pramukh samvaadadaata piyush babele se baatcheet main ayog kaa paksh rakhaa
 Excerpts from the conversation are: Is there any bias behind the success of the Yadav students in the OBC category of Uttar Pradesh PCS Exam 2011? The matter is under court consideration, so the comment will not be appropriate
 zyaadaatar yadav chaatro ko 140 yaa iske kareeb number mili hai, yah kaisaa sanyog hai?ayog kii karypranali puri tarah paardarshee he, ummidavaaron ko yogyata ke hisaab se ank mili hai
 It is wrong to see it through the prism of caste or religion
 vaise bhi chayan prakriya main ayog ke adhyaksh yaa sachiv kaa koi dakhal nahin hota
 The interview board does not even know the roll number of the student
 lekin pichley ek saal main ayog ke zyaadaatar pariksha parinaamon kaa virodh hua or pichley saal to chaatr andolan par utar aae
 Students are not agitating
 yah to koching sansthaanon ke ishaare par hangaamaa kiya gaya
 The coaching nexus seeks to discredit the commission
 aap bataaie andolankariyon main se kitne chaatro ne pisies kaa prilims bhi paas kiya he
 It should also be noted that now even indirect interference of the coaching runners is not being done in the selection of the candidates, whereas earlier these coaching institutes have been accused of influencing the exam results
 aise main yahi log chaatro kii aad main ashaanti failaa rahe hai
 The question is not only of giving more numbers in the interview, but there are allegations of giving preference to students of caste in scaling too
 scalling kaa formula to supreme court ke nirdesh par bana he
 In this, the data gets automatically on the data feed
 is tarah ke aaropon kaa to koi aadhaar hi nahin he
 Why are the results coming so late? The Commission is short of staff
 2003 main prashasnic sudhaar ayog ne ayog main 9 nae section banane or 100 bhartiyon karne kii sifarish kii thi, is par amal hona baaki he
 No new posts have been created here since 1987
 hamaare maujuuda staff main se 60 se adhik karmchaaree khud bhi compititive parikshaayen de rahe hai, aise main inhen ayog ke kaamkaaj se baahar rakhana pad rahaa he
 Despite all this, in the last one year, the Commission has collected more than 72 exam results, many of which were delayed since 2004
 kya behatar na hoga ki aap pisies jaisi rajya kii sarvocch pariksha ke antim parinaam kii marksheet saarvajanik kar den taaki kisi tarah ke duraav-chhipav ke kayaas khatm ho jaaen?ham apane niyamon se bandhe hai
 The marksheet of any student is his personal information
 agar ise saarvajanik kiya jaataa he to ise niztaa kaa ulanghan samajha jayega
 The list of successful candidates is made public
 lekin yahi antim suchi to saare vivaad ko hawa de rahi he
 You can also see that in which class most of the students are appearing in the examination and succeed in prelims or mains
 jis varg ke zyada chaatr bhagidaari karenge agar ve zyada safal hote hai to isamen aashcharya nahin hona chahie
 The commission's upcoming exam results will not be mired in controversy
 
 
 ayog pehle bhi paardarshee kaam karata rahaa he
 Despite this, if there is any doubt, who can stop him from going to court
 saarvajanik kshetra kii tel evam prakritik gas nigam (oengisi) kaa shuddh laabh 30 june ko samaapt hui timahi main kareeb 12 pratishat badhkar 4,095 karod rupee pahunch gaya
 Responsibility for subsidy payments on the company increased more than double in the quarter under review
 oengisi ke chairman evam prabandh nideshak eke hajarika ne bataaya ki april-june timahi main company kaa laabh 11
 9 percent to Rs 4,095 crore
 unhone kaha ki pehali timahi main kachche tel kii bikri par sakal prapti 121
 29 dollars per barrel, but after subsidizing it came down to just 48
 76 dollar prati bairal rah gai, jo beete vittvarsh kii isi avadhi kii shuddh prapti ke lagbhag samaan he
 It is noteworthy that ONGC and other oil and gas mining companies provide at least one-third of their income as subsidy to public sector refining companies
 jehar khaane vaale prakaash pandey kii maut ne jahaan ek taraf pradesh kii donon hi rajnatik partiyon ko apni siyasat chamakaane kaa mauka de diya he, vahiin duusari ore prakaash pandey kii maut kaa bahaanaa lekar ab pradesh ke khanan mafiyaan bhi trivendra sarkaar ko dhamkaane ke liye prakaash pandey kii raah chal aatmahatya karne koshish karne main lage hai
 Prakash Pandey was forced to eat poison and ended his life, but the excuse of his death is now becoming a weapon to threaten Trivendra Singh Rawat
 khanan vyapaaree ne kii aatmahatya karne kii koshish, 7 or logon ne di dhamkiuttarakhand kii rajdhani dehradun main guuruuvaar ko ek aisa maamla saamne aayaa jahaan ek or khanan vyapaaree ne aatmahatya karne koshish kii, halanki sahi samay par police ke dwaara uski is koshish ko vifal kar use hiraasat main le liya or sambandhit dhaaraon main us par mukadmaa darj karne kii taiyaari chal rahi he
 This resident of Ramnagar reached the official residence of the Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat directly on Thursday afternoon
 yahaan wo khud ko jalaane kii taiyaari ke saath panhucha tha, magar samay rahete police dwaara uski pahchaan kar use aisa karne se roak diya gaya
 This person had reached Dehradun because he wanted to smuggle it into the Kosi river in Nainital district, which was not allowed by the government
 sanjay bisht naamak ye vyakti is kadam ko uthaane se pehle hi apane dwaara record kiye gaye ek video ko viral kar chukaa tha, jisaki vajah se police tantra ke saath hi pradesh kaa khufia tantra bhi lagaataar najare banaaye hue tha, shaayad yahi kaaran rahaa ki ek or jaan jane se batch saki
 Currently, Sanjay Bisht is being interrogated by the city police captain Pradeep Rai
 aisa hi silsilaa ab lagaataar jari he
 The Chief Minister's media advisor informed about this by issuing official mail in which it is clearly written that 7 more people have threatened the Chief Minister to commit suicide, if this continues then these are not good signs for the state
 farji tareeke se madad karnaa thik he: harish ravatarajya ke purv mukhyamantri harish ravat ne bhi raajnneeti kar is mudde ko bhunaane main koi chook nahin kii, magar paksh or vipaksh donon kaa hi samarthan kar unhone ye baat saaf kar di ki unke liye prakaash pandey kii maut sirf ek mudda bhar he
 Prakash Pandey's video in which he told before dying how the Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat's OSD Urba Dutt Bhatt promised to help him up to 30 thousand by presenting fake papers, which was a crime
 lekin harish ravat ne ajtak se baat karte hue sarkaar ke OSD ko clinit dete hue kaha kii kam se kam farji tareeke se hi sahi usne mritak kii madad karne kii koshish to kii
 Along with this, he also gave a clean chit to Indira Hridayesh, playing the role of senior leader of his own party and Leader of Opposition in the House, but Harish Rawat, who is doing politics on Prakash Pandey, probably forgot that the deceased cleaned it before dying
 His message was to reach even Indira Hridayesh
 to kya wo aane se pehle indira hridayesh se milakar aayaa tha? kya indira hridayesh ke dwaara usko aatmahatya ke liye uksaaya gaya tha? kya uske is kadam kii pehle se hi jaankaree indira hridayesh ko thi? agar ye sahi he to paksh or vipaksh donon hi katghare main khadey hai
 The challenge for the Trivandra government is now the question for Uttarakhand Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat, because in the Janata Durbar organized by him, a person gave his life and the politicians instigating him are doing politics to increase this step
 jiske liye trivendra singh ravat ko sabhi aparaadhiyon ko unke anjaam tak pahunchane kii jarurat he, nahin to sarkaar ke liye abhi ye keval shuruyaat bhar he
 May it not be so difficult for Trivendra Singh Rawat

 ''bin laden prakaran pakistan ke liye pareshaani kaa sabab he

 pregnancy ke dauraan eksrasij bachche ke liye surakshit he or isse sijerian section kii ashanka kam ho jaati he
 a study done on 12,500 women from 16 countries has revealed that women who exercise during pregnancy and take healthy diets have a normal delivery
 bacchon ko paidaa hone se pehle hi 'sanskari' banane main juty RSS kii wingbata den ki britain main har chauthaa baccha si section se hota he
 Whereas in some states of India, 50 percent of women deliver through c section
 haalanki doctor sijerian delivery ko bhi surakshit bataate hai, lekin iske jokhimon se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa
 There is always a fear of infection in it
 kyonki delivery ke dauraan sharir se atyadhik khun nikal jaataa he or angon ko hui kshati ke kaaran bhi infections kaa dar rahata he
 Due to this, the child may also have problems in breathing

 Book: Mohini Mantri of Hindutva Writer: Badri Narayan Prakashan: Rajkamal Publication Price: 400 Rupeescover: Hardbound Badri Narayan's book 'mohini Mantri of Hindutva' has been written in an attempt to reveal the conspiracy that the cultural allies of BJP have been very subtle in the last ten years
 Has drawn a strategy to draw towards
 apni is kitaab main unhone tarkon saakshyon, vyaktigat taur par jutai gai jaankariyon or itihaaskaar-samajashastriyon ke hawaale se yah pramanit karnaa chaha he ki vishwa hindu parishad or sangh jaisi sansthaaon kaa ekmaatr uddeshy daliton ko hindutv ke vrihattar agenda se jodna he
 So that they can be united against Muslims and in the event of communal polarization, Dalits can be introduced to protect the upper caste Hindus
 unhone khaas kar uttar pradesh or bihar main hinduvadi shaktiyon ko is dhruvikaran or golbandi ke liye jimmedaar tehraaya he 
 In the first chapter, Bhoomika: Past and Politics, he says- 'in the eighties, the marginalized Dalit castes started emerging on the democratic platform and disintegrating the balance of power, then political parties were also renewed on their strategy
 Had to consider from '
 unhone sangh or vishwa hindu parishad ke alaava mukhyat: do raajnneetik partiyon kii dalit vichaardhaara kaa zikr kiya he, basapa or bijepi
 The Bahujan Samaj Party, which was formed for the empowerment of the oppressed, exploited Dalits for centuries, chose historical heroes as a symbol to instill confidence in the people, while the BJP selected characters from texts like the Ramayana and the Mahabharata
 masalan ramayana se shabari, nishadaraaj, mahabharat se eklavya or dhire-dhire unke jaateey nayakon ko ram or lakshmana ke avatar bataa kar yah jataane kaa prayaas kiya ki unhen savarna hinduon ne nahin, turk or mughal aakrantaon ne sadiyon pratadit kiya he
 Badri Narayan writes- 'BJP has tried to use the term deprived for Dalits, deprived is a safe word but has not avoided the use of the word dalit under the pressure of democratic politics
 vanchit isliye ki wo log kabhi hindu dharm or samskruti ke gauravshaalee rakshak or sangrakshak hua karte the, lekin samaaj main muslimon kii ghuspaith ke baad vanchit ho gaye
 The BJP also says that most of the people who fought and died for Hindus in the last forty five years of riots belonged to today's Dalit and backward castes
 iskaa arth yah hua ki hinduon kii raksha ke liye musalamaanon se ladane vaale vahi log the, jo ki tathyaatmak rup se galat nahin he
 It is well known to which class of people enjoy more in the riots, and medieval barbarism was definitely more suffered by this class
 yah to aitihaasik taur ek sthapit satya he
 He says that the strategies that the BJP adopted to make cultural nationalism a success proved to be effective and the party suddenly became a national rival of the Congress
 lekin dhire-dhire jab ram kaa myth vot dilaane main asafal hone laga to viechpi or sangh is vot bank kii jaateey smritiyon kii ore mude
 They testify that two popular heroes, dina-bhadari, are being presented as avatars of Rama and Lakshmana to capitalize on the considerable population of the Musahar caste in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar
 isi tarah dushaadh jati ke nayak salhes ko bhi bhagwaan ram kaa avatar bataaya ja rahaa he
 Nishadraj Guhy and Shabari are being made great Dalit icons
 shabari or nishadaraaj donon hi ram se jude hai
 Shabri's devotion to Rama is well known and Rama's compassion for Shabri is also unique
 ve maanate hai ki daliton main unke nayakon or jaateey smritiyon ko lekar abhimaan paidaa karne kaa ekmaatr uddeshy unhen musalamaanon ke khilaaf golband karnaa he
 While they themselves accept this truth, the desire of Dalits themselves to feel pride for their ethnic memories is strengthened
 uttar pradesh ke baharichamein suheldev ke myth kaa istemaal kiya gaya he
 The book mentions some historians who have written the genealogy or history of Dalits
 is kadi main ve kuch aryasamajiyon kii charchaa bhi karte hai
 The book has been written diligently, in which he has quoted all the big sociologists, historians, thinkers
 khud lekhak ne kai kshetron kaa daura kiya he or logon se baatcheet ke aadhaar par saboot jutaaye hai
 But in most places the vision is one-sided
 unhone sangh parivaar ko khatarnaak saanskrithik rashtrawaad kii ore badhate hue prastut kiya he, lekin vaishvik str par islam ke prachand rup ke barakes ek sangrakshnatmak or pratikriyaatmak shakti ke rup main inke udai ko dekhne se chook gaye hai
 They say that in Bahraich, the emblem of Pasi Nayak Suheldev has been given a completely communal color
 badrinarayan ke mutabik sangh parivaar ne suheldev ko ek vir paasi raja ke rup main chitrit karne main bahut had tak kamyaabi pai he, jisane muslim saiyad salaar gaji miyaan kaa vadh kiya tha or logon ko uske aatank se mukti dilaai thi
 There is also a Ghazi Mian Dargah in Bahraich, where millions of Hindus have faith
 lekin suheldev kaa mandir banavaakar or nautanki khelkar lagaataar vahaan kaa maahaul bigaada ja rahaa he
 However, he has written here that Hindus have been shocked by the flood of madrasas in Bahraich district
 lekhak ke mutabik, sangh daawa karata he ki gaji miyaan kii dargah pracheen kaal main balark rishi kaa ashram hua karti thi
 The Surajkund within it was tamed
 unhone suheldev ke mandir kii tasviir to kitaab main di he lekin dargah kii koi tasviir nahin di he
 According to history, Salar Ghazi was the nephew of Mahmud Ghazni
 kitaab main ilaake kaa sauhardra bigaade jane kaa to khub zikr he lekin mahmud gaznavi kaa bhaanja hone ke baavjood salaar masood ko sawaalon ke ghere se baahar rakhaa gaya he
 He has also taken up the glut of madrasas in Bahraich in a very simple manner and has consistently tried to establish that Suheldev's character is being painted in saffron
 kai jagahon par unke tark main dam he lekin kai jagahon par ajeebogareeb baaten bhi he
 They say that the Sangh has introduced the word nation instead of country to advance cultural nationalism
 ab unase poocha ja saktaa he ki angreji shabdon ke aatank se sahami hui hindi bhashaa main bhala raashtra shabd kaa istemaal kitne log karte he
 Even if we do, what is the difference between the word nation and country
 donon hi sanskrit shabd hai
 According to him, to get the votes of the Nishad, the Sangh and BJP have glorified Nishad Raj Guhy
 pehle mallahon ko ram or nishadaraaj ke sambandh kaa hawala dekar car seva ke liye uksaaya gaya tha ab unhen lagaataar hindu samskruti kii raksha ke liye aage aane ko nakaaratmak arth main prerit kiya ja rahaa he
 Their ethnic memories are being brought alive in the conflict of the two civilizations
 bihar se lekar uttar pradeshke alag-alag hisson kaa hawala dete hue unhone yah bhi mana he ki in tamaam jatiyon ke log jo hameshaa se savarnon ke saath khud ko dekhnaa chaahate the, atmabhimaan se vanchit the, ab upar uth rahe hai lekin sampradayikta ke vishay par aate hi ve sirf sangh parivaar ko dosha dete hai
 They do not even experience the tolerance and grandeur of Hinduism in the sense that it is only possible to call Dalit heroes like dina-bhadari and Salheus as the incarnation of Rama
 kyonki avatar kii puri avadharana hi is siddhant par aadhaarit he
 In Hinduism, humans are considered incarnations of God in their lives and God incarnates on earth as a human being
 yaheen se manushya or ishwar ke bich ek kadi jud jaati he, jo manushya se manushya ko bhi zyada aasaani se jodatii he
 To make his point weightier, the author has quoted the proverbs, poems popular for Muslims in Hindu society
 jaise 'dalit sena kii khoj' adhyay ke shuru main ek kahawat ko uddhrit karte hai- 'suar ke baar or turuk ke dadhi ek jaisaa hola'
 But these proverbs and all the poems have been written just to prove that the Sangh and the VHP are continuously extending their meaning to these proverbs
 lekhak ne bijepi netaonke bhaashan pesh kiye hai, ki kaise jati vishesh ko bhunaane ke liye unke saamne nayakon kaa gungan kiya ja rahaa he
 In the Politics of Cultural Sources chapter, he initially presents a statement of VHP leader and saint Swami Prapanacharya - 'ram is born in Dalits in some other form'
 kya vanchiton or sadiyon se shoshit jati ko aatma kaa gaurav pradaan karne ke liye unke lok se kisi nayak ko khojkar usamen ram ko pratishthit karnaa sirf sampradayik soch he? kya hindu samaaj ko jati-bhed or varna se mukt karne kii ye koshish sirf shadyantra he?lekhak ko is baat se bhi aapatti he ki shabari ko itnaa mahatv kyon diya ja rahaa he
 They say that the story of Shabri is not there in the Ramayana of Nesfield
 pehali baat to yah ki nesafield kii ramayana ko bharat main padhata koun he, duusari baat ye ki shabari kii katha is baat kaa akatya pramaan bhi he ki hindu dharm kii mul aatma main jati vyavastha jaisi koi cheez thi nahin
 Through all these characters dina-bhadari, Shabari, Suheldev, Eklavya, Salhees, Phoolan Devi, they have underlined the saffronisation of Dalits
 kitaab ke aakhri hissemen unhone likhaa he- 'gramin str par saamaajik yatharth kaa adhyayan karne vaale samajashastri ke rup main is tathy ko udghaatit karnaa meraa kartavya he ki uttarapradesh or bihar ke kai anchalon main lok-samskruti na keval maanviya bhaawanaaon se otprot he balki usamen sampradayikta kaa bhi kuch rang he'
 He further states that this does not mean that the people of the village are communal, but that all live with community harmony
 is sadbhaav ke neeche kaa sach ye bhi he ki bharat main hindu-musalmaan ek saath rahete hue bhi do bhinn samskritiyon ke vaahak ke rup main kabhi bhi aamane-saamne aa jate hai
 The frustration of centuries of slavery is deep in the Indian psyche
 or use pichley bees varshon main vaishvik aatankwaad, desh par hue tamaam aatanki hamalon, pakistan ke ghor islamickaran or kashmir samasya ne nirantar bal pradaan kiya he
 The points raised in this book are considerable but are one-sided, which does not resolve the question of communalism in a fair manner
 un baton main eemaandaar itihaas-bodh kaa bhi abhaav he
 In the backdrop of the detention of singer Rahatfateh Ali Khan in Delhi on charges of illegally holding foreign currency, the Pakistan government announced that Pakistani actors and artists must obtain a no-objection certificate before going on a trip to India
 ek aadhikarik bayaan ke anusaar paak abhinaytaon or kalakaaron ko grih mantralay kii ore anaapatti pramaan patr jari kiye jane se pehle samskruti mantralay unka satyaapan karegaa
