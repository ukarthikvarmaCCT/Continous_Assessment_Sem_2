mittal india today se kehete hai, ''court ne koi nayaa aadesh nahin diya he or puraane aadesh kaa anupaalan hoga
 But we are motivating people to build a base
 ''kya he centre kii ranneetikendre sarkaar aadhaar pariyojna ko lekar tab tak sansad main bill laakar praadhikaran ko kanoonee jama pehanaane ke mood main nahin he, jab tak ki supreme court use aisa karne ke liye majaboor na kare
 But she wants to restore the current situation
 petroleum mantri supreme court ke taaja aadesh par tippanee karne se bachate dikhe
 But he told India Today some time ago, "first we will do a digital mapping of the entire population of the country and then we will see it if we need to give constitutional recognition
" '' sarkaar kaa yahi beparwaah ravaiya aadhaar ko lekar bhram paidaa karata he
 Ministry officials contend that just as a ration card is necessary to get a ration, a passport is necessary to go abroad, similarly, whoever needs benefits under LPG or other schemes will have to make Aadhaar
 mantralay ke sutron ke mutabik, aadhaar kii anivaaryta ke liye nahin, balki yuidi ko swaittata dene or anya suvidhaon ke lihaaj se kanoon banane kii jarurat he
 Therefore, when the government gets a chance to present its case before the Supreme Court in July, it will plead with the facts and the success in preventing leakages as a plea to the facts
 isamen akele petroleum mantralay kaa aankada he ki 10 se 12 lakh log aise the jo gas sabsidi kaa doharaa laabh lete the, lekin aadhaar ke unic number or bank khaataa se jodgaye ke baad unhen iefessi code ke jariye pakadaa gaya
 D
 ke
 Mittal then advocates Aadhaar clearly saying, "aadhaar is a beneficial scheme
 har sarkaar ko adhikaar he ki yojana ke laabh ke liye apane nagarikon kii pahchaan kare
 This work should have been done in 1947 itself
 lekin ham ab kar rahe hai
 "it is clear from his plea that the government will not back down on grounds
" lekin uski mushkil rajnatik he kyonki modi sarkaar yah nahin dikhaanaa chaahati ki vipaksh main rahete hue bijepi ne jis aadhaar pariyojna par sawaal uthaae the, sankhya main aane ke baad vah usee par aage bad rahi he
 The Samajwadi Party also has an MLA who considers himself above the High Court and High Court orders
 maamla he lakhanu kaa, jahaan hoicourt ke aadesh ke baad avaidh patari dukaanon ko hataane gaye nagar nigam ke daste ko mananeey vidhayak ji ne rukvaa diya
 The MLA said that the track shoppers should be shifted to some other place before being removed
 lekin shanivaar ko jab nagar nigam kaa dasta dobaaraa court ke aadesh ke mutabik avaidh nirmaan todane gaya, to logon ke maseehaa bane vidhayak ji maukey par pahunche hi nahin
 Ravidas Mehrotra is the current MLA of Lucknow Central Region of Samajwadi Party
 vidhayak ji ke rasookh ke aage na chalati he nagar nigam kii, na chalati he police kii
 They even uphold the order of the court
 maamla he lakhanu kii mashhoor market aminabad kaa
 a petition was filed in the Lucknow bench of Allahabad regarding the problem of traffic jam in Aminabad and shops illegally planted on the roads
 yachika par sunwaayee karte hue nyaayalay ne jila prashasan ko patari dukandaaron or avaidh nirmaan ko 27 oktober tak hataakar 28 taarikh ko court main report pesh karne kaa aadesh diya tha
 When the Lucknow Municipal Corporation squad reached the market of Aminabad on the 22nd in the presence of the police to comply with the order of the High Court, the squad faced resistance from the track shopkeepers there first
 police ne sthiti ko sambhala or atikaraman hataane kaa kaam shuru hua
 But in the meantime, Ravidas Mehrotra, the MLA of the ruling party, reached there and announced to suspend the campaign
 chunki vidhayak sattapaksh ke the, lihaaja maukey par pahunche nagar nigam ke daste ko ulte paanv lautnaa padaa
 The MLA was adamant that arrangements should be made elsewhere before removing the track shopkeepers from here
 ravidaas mehrotra ne kaha ki lakhanu shahar main dedh lakh footpath dukandaar hai
 If there will be an action to destroy them without any system, then how will their problem be solved? He argued that the problem faced by such shopkeepers is livelihood
 jo footpath ke dukandaar hai, ve majaburi main apana pet paalane ke liye yah kaam karte hai
 They are poor, weak and helpless people
 unhone kaha ki hamaari ye maang he ki janata ko dikkat na ho, isliye inako ujaadne se pehle inaki vaikalpik vyavastha ho
 In this case, if someone's neck was stuck, it was the municipal corporation and the district administration
 ek taraf nagar nigam ko hoicourt ke aadesh kaa paalan karnaa tha, duusari taraf wo vidhayak ji ko naaraaz nahin kar sakate the
 Therefore, the Municipal Corporation found a middle way, under which a yellow strip was pulled along the roadside in the market of Aminabad
 us pili pattee ke andar hi patari dukandaaron ko dukaan lagane kaa aadesh diya gaya
 The date for breaking the illegal construction was fixed on 26 October
 jab is date par nagar nigam kii team avaidh nirmaan todane aminabad ke bazaar pahunchi, to logon ko ummid thi ki unke hamdard vidhayak ravidaas maharothra dukaanon ko bachaane phir pahunchenge, lekin aisa hua nahin
 The MLA could not be seen anywhere and the squad broke the illegal construction despite opposition from the people
 darasal vidhayak ji kii hekdi kaa maamla uchhalane laga, tab unhen mahasoos hua ki unka daanv un par baari bhi pad saktaa he
 So MLA came on the backfoot
 vitt mantri arun jetali ne sansad main vitt varsh 2018-19 ke liye aam bajet pesh kar diya he

 swatantraaa andolan main sardaar patel ke yogadan ko yaad karte hue modi ne kaha ki mahatma gandhi ne unhen aitihaasik dandi yatra kii yojana banane kaa daayitv saunpa tha, jise unhone safaltaapurvak puraa kiya
 The Prime Minister said, when we see Ramakrishna Paramahamsa it seems that he is not complete without Swami Vivekananda
 isi tarah se jab ham mahatma gandhi ko dekhte hai tab bhi vah sardaar patel ke bina adhure prathit hote hai
 Earlier welcoming the Prime Minister, Urban Development Minister m Venkaiah Naidu said, if Sardar Patel was the first Prime Minister of the country, then history would have been different
 aisa kai log mahasoos karte hai
 He also said that the purpose of the ceremony is not to undermine the contribution of any other political leader
 sangh kaa hameshaa se yah maananaa rahaa he ki uttarottar sarkaron ne jawahar laal nehru or nehru gandhi parivaar ke yogadan ko dusron se adhik tavajjo di
 Comparing Sardar Patel to Chanakya, Modi said, the country can never forget Sardar Patel
 shatabdiyon pehle, chanakya ne choti riyasaton ko ekajute karke ek majboot dhaancha sthapit karne kaa safal prayog kiya tha
 He said, after independence, the same person was done by Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, whose today we are celebrating his birth anniversary
 pradhanmantri ne kaha, yah durbhagyapurna he ki ek aisa vyakti jisane apana puraa jivan bharat kii ekta ke liye samarpit kar diya use apane raajnneetik jivan main virodh or aalochanaon kaa saamana karnaa padaa, lekin vah desh ko ekajute rakhane ke apane lakshya se kabhi vichlit nahin hua
 Addressing the people participating in 'run for Unity', Modi said, our culture and heritage is unity in diversity
 hamen jati, samudaay, bhashaa ke vibhedon se upar uthanaa chahie
 The Prime Minister said that Sardar Patel, through his skill, vision and patriotism, united the country in one thread
 vibhaajan ke baad desh ko ekajute rakhane main patel ke yogadan ko yaad karte hue modi ne kaha, sardaar patel ne bharat ko kai chote kshetron main vibhajit karne kii angrejon kii yojana dhwast kar di
 He alone merged all 550 territories into the country
 modi ne british shashan ke khilaaf swatantraaa sangharsh main kisaanon ko ekajute karne kii sardaar patel kii duuradrushti or kootnithik kshamta kii bhi prashansa kii
 He said, his act of uniting the peasants as a force in the freedom movement, destroyed the British dream of dividing India into smaller parts
 logon se jatvaad, sampradayikta or bhashaayi baadhaon se upar uthne kaa aahvaan karte hue pradhanmantri ne kaha, sardaar patel ne hamen ek bharat diya, hamen ise mahaan bharat bananaa he
 After flagging off 'run for Unity', Modi also led the race by walking a little faster
 is daud main susheel kumaar, vijender singh, virendra sahvaag or gautam gambhir jaise khilaadiyon ne bhi hissaa liya
 Along with Union Ministers Sushma Swaraj, Venkaiah Naidu, Arun Jaitley and others, the Prime Minister administered the oath of unity to the participants in the race
 isse pehle modi ne patel chowk par sardaar patel kii pratimaa par pushpanjali arpit kii, jise is avasar par sajaayaa gaya tha
 The security forces have once again achieved great success in the campaign against terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir
 pulavama main suraksha balon ne khoonkhaar aatanki sanghathan lashkar-e-taiyaba ke commander wasim ahamed shah or aatanki nisaar ahamed mir ko maar giraaya
 Local people started protesting after the terrorists were killed
 is dauraan suraksha balon ke saath jhadap main ek vyakti kii maut ho gai or teen log ghayal ho gaye
 After this incident, internet and mobile services have been stopped in the area
 ek police adhikari ne bataaya ki suraksha balon ne pulavama ke littar ilaake me aatankwaadiyon kii maujuudagi kii soochna milane ke baad subah oparation chalaaya
 He said that the militants opened fire on the security forces, after which the security forces retaliated
 adhikari ke anusaar, maare gaye duusare aatankwaadi kii pahchaan nisaar ahamed mir ke taur par hui he
 After this encounter, the state's DGP SP Vaidya said, "wasim Shah used to recruit terrorists, it is a big success
 ' wasim shah ko A++ shrenee kaa aatanki bataaya jaataa he
 An AK-47 rifle, an AK-56 and 6 magazines have been recovered from the terrorists
 is encounter ke baad sthaneey logon kii surakshabalon ke saath jhadap ho gai, jisamen goli lagane se chaar log ghayal ho gaye
 The injured have been rushed to a local hospital where one of the injured succumbed
 mritak kii pahchaan gulzaar ahamed ke rup main hui he
 He was a resident of Lassipura in Pulwama
 vahiin, is ghatana ke baad adhikariyon ne ilaake main internet or mobile seva band karne kaa faisla liya he
 Earlier on Wednesday, security forces killed two militants of terrorist organization lashkar-e-taiba in an encounter in Bandipora district of Jammu and Kashmir
 is muthbhed menvayusena ke do garud commandobhi shahid ho gaye the
 This was the first time that two Garun commandos of the Air Force were martyred in a campaign against terrorists in the valley
 sena ke ek adhikari ke mutabik aatankiyon kii maujuudagi kii soochna milane ke baad surakshabalon ne bandipura jile ke hajin ilaake main gheraabandi or talaashi abhiyaan chalaaya tha
 Apart from this, on October 2, the BSF camp in Gogo Humhama area near the airport in Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir, was attacked by terrorists
 BSF kii 182veen batalian par hue is hamale main sena ne teen aatankiyon ko maar giraaya tha
 One ASI was killed in this attack, while three jawans were injured
 maaloom ho ki sena kashmir se aatankiyon kaa safaya karne ke liye 'oparation olout' chalaa rahi he
 Under this, a list of terrorists has been prepared, on the basis of which search operations are being conducted and action is taken against terrorists in different areas
 ab tak is oparation ke tahat kai aatankiyon ko ghati main dher kiya ja chukaa he
 Narendra Modi will take oath as Prime Minister on 26 May, but he has already started work
 aisa shaayad pehali baar hua he, jab kisi netaa ne pradhanmantri pad kii shapath lene or raashtrapati se sarkaar banane ke liye nimantran milane se pehle hi kaam shuru kar diya ho
 Modi has met the Cabinet Secretary and the Home Secretary
 khabaron ke mutabik unhone in donon hi aalaa afasaron ko kai mahatvapurn kaam karne ke liye kah diya tha
 Similarly, he has also met several senior leaders of the party regarding the formation of the government
 mana ja rahaa he ki modi sarkaar desh ke itihaas kii sabase kasi hui sarkaar hogi
 a government that is neither forced to succumb to the pressure of allies to take up the ministry in the name of coalition compulsions nor to adjust the pressure of elderly leaders to balance the party's internal equations
 75 basant paar kar chuke netaaon ke liye rajbhawanon ke daravaaje kholane kii taiyaari he
 Modi himself is 63 years old and with the exception of one or two exceptions in his government, no leader older than him can be made a minister
 sarkari kharchon main katautee karne or kaam main dakshata or kushalta badhaane ke liye mantralayon main kaant-chhaant or unhen aapas main milaane kii sabase badi kavayad kii ja rahi he
 According to sources, preparations have been going on for several months about the possible form of Modi government
 kai viksit deshon kii sarkaron ke model kaa adhyayan kiya gaya or ek moti report taiyaar kii gai he
 Discussion is going on on the basis of this report that many unnecessary ministries will be abolished
 kai mantralayon ko aapas main mila diya jayega or kai mantralayon ko nigamon main tabdeel kar diya jayega
 For example, it is proposed to separate internal security from the Ministry of Home Affairs
 is prastaav ke tahat ek rajyamantri ko aantarik suraksha kaa prabhaar dekar use sidhe pradhanmantri karyaalay ke adheen kar diya jayega
 Modi will be able to directly monitor the day-to-day functioning of agencies like IB and NIA
 isi tarah ek nayaa infrastracchar mantralay banane kaa prastaav he, jisamen bhootal parivahan or jahajrani jaise kai anya mantralay milaae ja sakate hai
 It was also proposed to form the Ministry of Transport including the Railway Ministry, but considering the huge size of the Ministry of Railways, there is an idea to keep it separate at the moment
 petroleum or prakritik gas, urja, koyala or gaiyr-paaramparik urja strot jaise alag-alag mantralayon ko milakar urja mantralay banaaya ja saktaa he, jabaki gramin vikaas or panchayat raaj mantralayon ko bhi ek kiya ja saktaa he
 Similarly, it is proposed to form a heavy ministry by merging the Ministries of Industry, Commerce, Textiles and Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises
 krishi, khaadya, khaadya prasanskaran, naagarik upabhokta or aapurti mantralayon ko bhi aapas main milaane kii yojana he
 There is also a proposal that a new Ministry be formed by merging the Ministries of Telecommunications, Information Technology and Information and Broadcasting
 iske peeche soch yah he ki jab kshetra ek hi he, to use alag-alag vibhaagon main kyon baanta jaae
 Several non-core ministries are also proposed to be abolished
 overseas indian jaise mantralayon kii zarurat mahasoos nahin kii ja rahi he
 There is also a proposal that many ministries be converted into corporations and given their responsibility to a technocrat
 is tarah chah maheene ke bheetar rajyasabha yaa loksabhaa se chunakar laane ke jhanjhat se bachaa ja sakegaa
 The Ministry of Minority Affairs can also be further converted into a corporation, while it is also proposed to create a separate ministry or corporation to connect or clean rivers
 darasal, mantralayon ko baantkar alag-alag portpholio banane kii kavayad gathbandhan kii raajnneeti or varisht netaaon ko khush karne kii ranneeti ke tahat '90 ke dashak main bani asthir sarkaron ke daur se shuru hui thi
 No one would have guessed that after the year 84, a stable government is going to be formed which not only belongs to one party but also has to bow to the blackmail of allies
 modi ke saamne koi majaburi nahin he ki rail yaa raksha jaise mahatvapurn mantralay kisi sahyogi dal ko khush rakhane ke liye de die jaaen, jaisaa vaajapeyi sarkaar ke vakt hua tha
 It is said that if any ministry has been the biggest victim of coalition politics, then it is the Ministry of Railways
 kul milakar isi puri kavayad ko 'bhuto na bhavishyati' ke andaaz main anjaam diya ja rahaa he
 The work plan is being prepared in the coming five years with the mantra of 'modi Means Business'
 ek aisi sarkaar kii neenv rakhi ja rahi he, jo 21veen sadi main bharat ko ek aarthik mahashakti banane ke raste par majbootee or teevr gati se lekar jaae
 That is why it is said that if the faces of many leaders of BJP and allies are seen hanging due to lack of a place in the cabinet on 26th, it will not be surprising
 sarkaar ne guuruuvaar ko kaha ki dilli main har din vaayu pradooshan ke kaaran lagbhag 80 logon kii maut hoti he
 This information has been given in a recently released international study
 rajyasabha main ek prashn ke likhit uttar main paryaavaran mantri prakaash jaavdekar ne kaha ki pradooshit vaayu ragnata or samaypurv maut ke liye jimmedaar tatwon main se ek he
 The minister said that an international study released claimed that about 80 people die daily in Delhi due to polluted air
 adhyayan main die gaye samaypurv marane waalon kii sankhya tarksaadhay anumaan or sambandhit aankadon par aadhaarit he
 He said that the government had sponsored two studies in this regard in Delhi, which were done during the year 2003-2005
 adhyayan se sanket miltaa he ki chromosome or diene ke kshatigrast hone kaa sambandhpradooshanse he jo vibhinn rogon ke jokhim ko badhaata he
 -input language dilli sarkaar shahar main ek baar phir se od-ivan yojana lagu karne ja rahi he
 This time, from April 15 to 30, aud-even will be in force
 dilli main aisa duusari baar hone ja rahaa he lekin is baar garmiyon ko dekhte hue chunauti zyada he
 However, the government seems more cautious this time keeping in mind the shortcomings of the previous time
 is baar nayaa kya?od taarikh vaale din sirf wo gaadiyaan chalengi jinka aakhri number od hoga or ivan vaale din sirf wo gaadiyaan hi chalengi jiskaa aakhri number ivan hoga
 Apart from this, a category has also been created in the odd-even scheme
 is baar do darjan se zyada catagories ke drivers or vaahanon ko chhot di gai he jisaki vajah se trephic police ko niyam kaa ulanghan karne waalon kii pahchaan karne main khaasi mashkkat kerani hogi
 However, the Delhi Traffic Police has completed preparations to implement the scheme
 dilli main od-ivan ke dauraan start ap ne kii muft yatra, bonus kii peshkashpulice hogi sakht, niyam todaa to legi jurmaanadilli trephic police kaa kahana he ki pehali baar police ne chaalaan kam kaate or logon ko jaagruk bhi kiya tha lekin is baar police kaa kaam sirf chaalaan kaatna hoga
 That is, if you are not going to obey the rule of odd-even, then carry 2 thousand cash in your pocket separately
 police ne kar lee he planningamtaur par dilli main har roj lagbhag 25,000 vaahanon kaa chaalaan kiya jaataa he
 This number will increase further after audi-even is implemented
 police ke saamne samasya ye he ki peak aavars main agar vyast road par kaaron ko roak diya gaya to lanbaa trephic jam lag saktaa he
 Special planning has been done to deal with this
 civil dephence ke walantirs niyam todane waalon ko samajhaayenge, lekin unhen road par car rokane yaa phir chaalaan karne kaa adhikaar nahin hoga
 Challenge due to heat? Like last time, this time the plan is being implemented for 15 days till April 15-30
 puure uttar bharat ke saath-saath dilli bhi badhati garmi kii chapet main he or aise main od-ivan lagu karnaa logon ke liye kitna suvidhajanak yaa kitna tang karne vaala hoga, ye to vakt hi batayega
 aud-even was last implemented between January 1-15 and people did not face much trouble due to winter
 lekin jhulasane vaali garmi main logon kii chintaa is baat ko lekar bad gai he ki vosaarvajanik parivahanonse safar kaise karenge
 The last time was a school holiday during odd-even
 lekin is baar skool bhi chaalu hai or mausam bhi garmi kaa he
 In such a situation, the challenge before the government is that people should not face any kind of trouble in the second phase of aud-even
 mahilaon ko is baar bhi chhot lekin
 
 
 Women are also being given exemption in the second phase of the scheme, but the condition is that there should be no men in the car with them
 parents ke saamne bada sankatdilli sarkaar od-ivan ke duusare charan ke liye puri tarah taiyaar he lekin schuli bacchon ke mata-pita garmi ke mausam main is yojana kii vajah se mushkilon main ghire najar aa rahe hai
 Parents are concerned about how to bring the children back home during school leave
 haalanki dilli sarkaar aise abhibhavakon ko car-pool karne kii salaah de rahi he
 School associations are also expecting some solution from the Delhi government regarding this dilemma of parents
 ditisi ne bhi khinch liye haath, privet skulon ko basen dene se inkarditisi ne privet skulon se kaha he ki wo od-ivan skim ke dauraan basen muhaiyaa nahin kara paaegi
 Many private schools have issued circulars for parents to make arrangements for themselves to leave the school and take them home from April 15-30
 iske chalate abhibhavak bhi mushkil main pad gaye hai
 Appeal for cooperation from the public, R
 of Delhi State Public School Management
 si
 Jain says, "we had a meeting in which the principal was also mentioning that the parents were approaching him
 sarkaar ko iskaa bhi samaadhaan nikaalnaa chahie
 Delhi Transport Minister Gopal Rai said, "85 percent of women go to take children and this scheme is designed for the convenience of 90 percent of the public
" agar 10 fisadi log pareshaan ho rahe hai to unase hamaari apil he ki wo bhi sahyog karen
 Car can pull
 padosi kii madad le sakate hai
 Also applicable in these cities of the world, this formulaoud-even was first started in 2008 before the Summer Olympics in Beijing
 shuruyaat main ise asthaayee taur par lagu kiya gaya tha lekin iskaa itnaa asar hua ki sarkaar ne ise sthai taur par lagu karne kaa faisla kar liya
 In fact, during the temporary implementation of odd-even, there was a 40 percent reduction in the environment
 isi tarah ke niyam paris, landan, mexico city, saao poulo or bogota jaise shaharon main jam or pradooshan se nipatane ke liye lagu kiye gaye

 Sources in the Central Information Commission say that perhaps due to the information coming in the notification, the CBI officials were requesting adjournment of the cases before the Commission for hearing
 artiai ke kaaryakartaaon ko dar he ki sibiai shaayad un vibhaagon kii suchi main pehla vibhaag ho saktaa he, jinhen sarkaar aage chalakar artiai se mukt kar sakati he
 There is already a request from the Central Public Service Commission to keep it out of the purview of RTI, the Supreme Court is also among those making such requests

 The election of Karnataka has become a question of life and death for the three parties - Congress, BJP and JDS
 karnataka main vidhansabha chunaav ke liye 12 may ko voting hogi or 15 may ko parinaam aaenge
 For which the three major parties have given their full strength
 lekin chunaav prachaar kii teji ke saath-saath karnataka main farji khabaron kii bharmaar bhi ho gai he jinka makasad he logon kii najar main virodhiyon kii image ko dharashayi karnaa
 These news are being spread on social media in such a way that people get confused and accept them as true
 kuch khabaren to sidhe-sidhe nakli or kai baar haasyaaspad dikhti hai
 But there are also reports that such a tremendous effort has been made to show that as real that anyone can be deceived
 soshal media par ek video viral hua jisamen kannada gane par ek shaks jamkar naach rahaa he jisamen yah dikhaane kii koshish kii gai ki video main naachne vaala shaks khud karnataka kemukhyamantri siddharmaiyaahain
 But actually the man who is seen dancing in this video is a lookalike of Siddaramaiah
 karnataka chunaav ko ek chunavi survey bhi soshal media par chalaaya gaya jiske mutabik congress ko 76, bijepi ko 75 or jedies ko 70 siten milane kii bhavishyavaanee kii gai
 That is, no one will get a majority in the assembly with 224 seats
 ye khabar bhi soshal media par khub viral hui jisamen kaha gaya tha ki ye opinian pole todes chanakya ne karaayaa he
 But the news of the news was exposed when Today Chanakya made it clear by tweeting that he had not conducted any such opinion poll
 had to tab ho jabasoshal mediamein kathith rup se rajya sarkaar ke intelligence branch kii ek chitthee viral ho gai jisamen mukhyamantri ko chamundeshwari seat se chunaav nahin ladane kii salaah di gai thi kyonki ye seat jeetna mushkil hoga
 In this letter written in English, four other seats were also suggested for contesting elections
 is seat par ediji intelligence kaa dastakht kiya gaya he or muhar bhi lagi he
 But after looking very carefully, it is found that Fire and Emergency Services is written in the seal, it is absurd to have the Intelligence report written in Fire and Emergency Services
 maamle kii tah main jane ke liye 'ajtak' ne karnataka police kii oficial website par jaakar pataa lagaaya ki ediji intelligence he koun jinka dastakht is letters par kiya gaya he
 According to the website, Ashit m Prasad is posted on this post
 lekin jab 'ajtak' ne unase baat kii to ashit em prasad ne bataaya ki unka pramotion to pichley saal hi ho chukaa he or wo diji ban chuke hai
 There is no one on the post of ADG Intelligence while this letter is being reported as of April 5
 prasad ne bataaya ki unke naam se jari ye letters puri tarah se nakli he or ye dastakht bhi unka nahin he
 He said that he is also registering an FIR in this regard
 karnataka ke chunaav main arun jetali chunaav prachaar nahin kar rahe hai
 Despite this, opponents also dragged him to the Karnataka elections
 soshal media par kuch logon ne kahana shuru kar diya ki jetali ne kathua main balaatkaar ke maamle ko maamuli ghatana qaraar diya he
 The truth is that Jaitley has not given any statement about Kathua
 jis video ko kathua kaa bataaya ja rahaa he wo video darasal 21 agast 2014 kaa he jisamen unhone kaha tha ki kaise ek ghatana se bhi desh kii badanaami hoti he
 You are not the only one because of debt
 bhartiya corporate jagat ke sir par karj kaa bhaar do guna ho gaya he
 In 4 years, the Indian industry has taken more debt than the country's foreign currency reserves
 dilachasp baat ye he ki karj main 107 pratishat kaa ijapha hua he
 Dumka's riot is going to be interesting once again
 jharkhand ke do kaddavar adivasee netaa shibu sorain or babulal marandi 15 saalon baad ek baar phir aamane-saamne honge
 Significantly, after the formation of the state of Jharkhand in 2000, Babulal Marandi became the Chief Minister of the state and then he said goodbye to the land of Dumka
 jharkhand main yun to loksabhaa kii har seat par kaante kii takkar kii ummid jataai ja rahi he, lekin jharkhand kii up-rajdhani dumka se babulal marandi ke chunaav maidan main utarane se chunavi paridrishy kaaphi badal gaya he
 Here two arch rivals are once again face to face after 15 years
 dumka ST surakshit seat he
 In this seat dominated by Santhal tribals, Shibu Soren and Babulal Marandi are both out-of-place Santhal tribals, but both have strong ground hold
 in donon diggajon ke bich hue pichley muqablon main marandi ko do baar shikast mili he, vahiin shibu sorain ko ek baar munh kii khaani padi he
 By the way, Babulal Marandi has beaten Rupi Soren, wife of Shibu Soren, and has done the same
 babulal ke chunaav maidan main utarane se shibu sorain bhi kaaphi utsahit hai
 He says that the leader's fight is ultimately with the leader
 dumka seat is baar donon kshatrapo ke liye naak kii ladaai ban gaya he
 However, on March 24, bjp's Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi is going to try his best to add saffron here by organizing a rally in Dumka
 vaise modi lahar is adivasee belt main bhi asardaar hogi, isaki sambhaavna kam he
 Chief Minister Sheila Dixit may also fail to save her seat in the upcoming Delhi Assembly elections
 nai dilli vidhansabha seat par aam aadmi party ke sanyojak arvind kejariwal unhen baari antar se haraa sakate hai
 The English newspaper 'economic Times' quoted an opinion poll as saying that this time the biggest upset could happen on the New Delhi assembly seat
 akhbaar ne vidhansabha kshetra ke 2101 registerd votaron par yah survey kiya
 According to this, 40 percent of the people are going to vote for Kejriwal in the voting going on the 4th
 kejariwal purushon or mahilaon donon kii pasand banakar ubhar sakate hai
 According to the survey, they may get 41 per cent of the votes for men and 42 per cent for women
 survey ke mutabik, teen baar kii mukhyamantri shila dikshit ko sabase kam vot milane vaale hai
 They have to be satisfied with only 20 percent of the votes
 duusare number par rahenge bijepi ke ummidavaar vijendra gupta
 They can get 21 percent of the vote
 22 se 24 november ke bich karaae gaye is survey main bahut kam logon ne hissaa liya he
 But still it has raised serious questions on Sheila Dixit's long political career
 agar vah kejariwal jaise nae navele netaa se chunaav haar gayi to yah na sirf dilli balki rashtriya str par congress party ke liye bada jhatka hoga
 It will also be an occasion of great disappointment for Congress workers in terms of next year's Lok Sabha elections
 akhbaar ne yah survey 'phase tu phase' intervyuu ke jariye karavaaya
 That too at a time when the Aam Aadmi Party is grappling with the specter of a controversial sting operation
 survey kii maane to 45 saal ke kejariwal ko samaaj ke sabhi virgon kaa samarthan mil rahaa he
 He is very popular especially among the youth
 survey ke mutabik, 18 se 25 kii umr ke 49 fisadi log kejariwal ko vot dene vaale hai
 At the same age, 19 percent will vote for Congress and 20 percent for BJP
 is survey main hissaa lene waalon main 21 fisadi log 18 se 25 saal ke the
 The Aam Aadmi Party seems to be in a better position than the bjp-congress in all sections of the age
 akhbaar ke mutabik, unke is survey main sirf 2
 There is a 'margin of error' of 12 per cent
 akhbaar ne survey par 95 fisadi confidence level jataayaa he
 This assembly constituency 1
 23 lakh votaron kaa ghar he
 Prior to the delimitation in 2008, the area was called the Round Market
 shila ke chunavi safar ke lihaaj se yah unka 'home ground' he
 She has won the election thrice from here
 haalanki unki jeet kaa antar pichley do chunaavon main kam hua he
 The song 'kala Chashma' from the film 'baar Baar Dekho' is very much liked by the audience
 darshak us gane main katrina kaa luk or dance donon ko khub pasand karte dikh rahe hai
 Many parody versions of this song have been made
 ab jise aapane sirf 'yaara o yaara' gane par dance step karte dekha he, wo is gane par dance karte najar aa rahe hai
 Actually, a different video of this song is going viral on youtube
 ismensoni deol dancekarte najar aa rahe hai
 Tell who did not shoot for this, rather those who run a youtube channel called Pay Attention have edited the new song Kala Chashma on Sunny's old song 'chammak Challo'
 is gane parasanika dance dekh aap lot pot ho jaaenge
 This video is becoming very viral on the Internet
 film 'baar-baar dekho' 9 sitambar ko relies ho rahi he
 It stars Siddharth Malhotra, Katrina Kaif, Ram Kapoor in the lead roles
 nitya mehara dwaara nirdeshit is film ke nirmaataa karan johar, farhaan akhtar or ritesh sidhvani hai

 ' The Congress today made it clear that it will not back down from the decision to support the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) for government formation and said that it has supported the new party's manifesto

 i am very clear that the role of the opposition is to protest and to see what the government is doing and what promises it has made
 or ham apni puri kshamta ke saath yah bhoomika nibhaayenge
 When asked about the lack of trust between the Congress and the AAP, Dixit said that we oppose each other
 'aap' congress ke khilaaf har kism ke aarope laga rahi hai
 You cannot expect a sense of trust in such a situation
 or isliye hamaare pradesh congress adhyaksh ne sapasht kar diya ki ham aap ko samarthan nahin kar rahe hai, balki uske ghoshnaa patr ko or unhone jo kuch bhi vaade kiye hai, use samarthan kar rahe hai
 Sandeep Dixit said, let's give them time and give them an opportunity
 unhone un sab kaamon, jisaki unhone baat kii he, ko karne ke liye do se teen maheene kaa samay maanga he

 This is the first time Kalki has acted in a period film
 unke liye bhi is kirdaar ko nibhaana aasaan nahin tha
 Kalki said, 'it was a big challenge to do my look in the film
 iske liye mere bahut saare luk test hue
 The way people used to talk in the 70's, they used to like listening to rock and roll music at that time, we all researched it a lot and did a lot of workshops

 Once again the pair is ready to entice the audience in a slightly different style
 aam aadmi party ne pradhanmantri narendra modi or uparajyapal anil baijal ke khilaaf andolan tej karne kaa elaan kiya he

 ' saath hi unhone alji baijal or piem narendra modi par nishaanaa sadhate hue aarope lagaaya ki muddon kaa samaadhaan karne ke liye ve 'chintit nahin' hai
 In a symbolic demonstration, the AAP leaders of all 70 seats in Delhi sent ration packets to the Prime Minister's residence and registered their protest
 unka ishaara alji baijal dwaara mahatvakankshi pariyojna ko manjuuri dilaane kii taraf tha taaki logon ke daravaaje tak rashan bheja ja sake
 At the residence of Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, AAP leaders made a strategy to agitate on the PMO
 is baithak main aap ke vidhayak, parshad or anya padaadhikari maujuud rahe
 Explain that Kejriwal is sitting on a dharna at Baijal's residence along with Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia and ministers Satyendra Jain and Gopal Rai
 aap pravaktaa saurabh bharadwaj ne kaha ki kejariwal or mantri centre sarkaar or uparajyapal se aagrah kar rahe hai ki iees adhikariyon ko nirdesh den ki ve apni 'avaidh hadtaal' khatm karen
 Why are you making agitation? The Aam Aadmi Party alleges that Lt
 Governor Anil Baijal has sent it for the prior approval of the Central Government for pending the ration scheme
 is yojana ko manjuuri dene, dilli ko purna rajya kaa darja dene or dilli sarkaar ke adhikariyon kii hadtaal khatm karaane kii maang ko lekar aap sanyojak or dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal tathaa mantri rajanivas main chah din se anshan kar rahe hai
 Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Singh from AAP, describing it as a way of protest, said that the Prime Minister is a resident of Delhi, there should be no shortage of ration in his house
 isaliye aaj ham unke ghar chaaval pahunchaa rahe hai, aage bhi jarurat kaa rashan unke ghar pahunchaa denge
 He told that you are also requesting Prime Minister Modi by writing the MLA and activist that the ration of the people of Delhi should not be stopped
 vipakshi dalon kaa bhi kejarwal ko samarthanaap ke andolan ko tedepa pramukh chandrababu naidu evam jharkhand mukti morcha (jhamumo) ke kaaryakari adhyaksh hemanth sorain ne bhi samarthan diya he
 Naidu said that the practice of using the office of the Governor for the benefit of the ruling party at the Center is contrary to the spirit of the Constitution
 ham dilli kii nirvaachit sarkaar ke prati apana samarthan vyakt karte hai
 At the same time, Leader of Opposition in the Jharkhand Assembly Hemant Soren tweeted that my salute to the fight being fought by the people of Delhi for their rights
 janata dwaara chuni aap sarkaar ko is dhang se baar-baar apane adhikaron ke liye sadak par aane ko majaboor karnaa kahaan kaa loktantr he? kejariwal samet janata ke is sangharsh main jharkhand unke saath khadaa he
 aap's charge: In response to Kamkejriwal's hunger strike at the behest of the PMO, Leader of Opposition Vijender Gupta and other BJP mlas also fasted at the Chief Minister's Office
 bijepi ke anshan ko aap ne adhikariyon kii hadtaal ke sach ko chupaane kii sajeesh qaraar diya
 AAP leader Saurabh Bhardwaj said that we have been saying from day one that this strike is a political conspiracy
 iees adhikariyon kii hadtaal kaa bachaav bhaajapa ke vidhayak or netaa kar rahe hai
 It is clear that all this is happening at the behest of the PMO and under the protection of the Lieutenant Governor

 Prior to this Ajatashatru was a member of the National Conference
 a post shared by Priyanka Chopra (@priyankachopra) on Aug 18, 2018 at 5:38am PDT The committee constituted by the government is in talks with employees' representatives after the controversy over allowances following the recommendation of the 7th Pay Commission report
 pichley ek maheene main kai baar yah khabar ai kii is samiti ne baatcheet puri kar lee he or apni report sarkaar ko saunp di he
 But later it became clear that the committee is still talking to the staff representatives
 sutron kaa kahana he ki aaj bhi samiti kii ek baithak karmchaariyon ke pratinidhiyon se hone ja rahi he
 What will be decided in this meeting will be known after the meeting
 shaam chaar baje baithak kaa samay nirdhaarit he
 For information, please tell that the employees have objected to the recommendations of the Seventh Pay Commission on the issue of HRA, TA-DA as well as many more allowances
 ullekhneey he ki angrejon ke shashan kaal se chale aa rahe kai bhatton ko saatven vetan ayog ne samaapt kar diya he
 The Seventh Pay Commission has either abolished most of the 196 allowances present or has kept only 55 allowances
 saatven vetan ayog (seventh Pay Commission) kii siforeeshon par kendriya karmchaariyon kii aapattiyon ke niraakaran ke liye sarkaar ne sabhi muddon par baatcheet ke liye teen samitiyon ko gathan kiya tha jinako karmchaariyon ke pratinidhiyon se baatcheet ke liye adhikrut kiya gaya tha
 a committee was formed under the leadership of Finance Secretary Ashok Lavasa
 isi samiti ke paas alouns kaa mudda bhi tha
 It was earlier being said that the last meeting of this committee was held on 22nd of February in which the issue of allowance was last discussed with the employees
 alouns samiti se baatcheet karne ke liye karmchaariyon ke sanyukt sanghathan enzesie ke pratinidhi shaamil hue the
 (seventh Pay Commission: Union Minister in Parliament said important reason for delay in committee report) mana ja rahaa he ki sarkaar ne transport alouns (yatra bhatta) ko do bhaagon main baanta he
 One is the CCA and the other is the TA given as undone
 yah paanchaven vetan ayog kii bhaanti dey hoga, aisa mana ja rahaa he
 It is also being said that they will be separated from DA and this fix will be fixed at slab rate
 yah bhi kaha ja rahaa he ki samiti ne karmchaariyon kii maang ko maanate hue echaare kii dar ko chathe vetan ayog kii report ke hisaab se dene kii baat ko sweekaar kar liya he
 The second most important question still remains as to how long the government has agreed to give the HRA
 yah prashn abhi bhi karmchaariyon ko sata rahaa he
 Does this rate 1
 1
 16 or 1 is applied
 4
 With effect from 17, it will be applicable
 jahaan tak karmchaariyon kaa sawaal he vah ise pichley saal janvari se lagu karwaane kii maang karte rahe hai or sarkaar kii ore se kuch samay pehle aisa ishaara mila tha ki sabhi vivaadit alouns ko 1 april 2017 se lagu kiya jayega
 For information, let us tell that the demand of employees is that HRA should be decided on the basis of the old formula or its rate should be increased
 kendriya karmchaariyon kaa kahana he ki vartmaan main tay formula ke hisaab se echaare karmchaariyon ko pehle kii tulana main kam milane laga he
 Let me tell you that there is confusion about many allowances given to the Central Employees by the Seventh Pay Commission
 narendra modi sarkaar ne 2016 main saatven vetan ayog (7th Pay Commission) kii siforeeshon ko manjuuri di thi or 1 janvari 2016 se 7wein vetan ayog kii report ko lagu kiya tha
 However, due to disagreement on several issues with allowances, these recommendations were not fully implemented
 kaha ja rahaa he ki sarkaar kii ore se baatcheet ke liye adhikrut adhikari echaare ko 1 str upar karne ko taiyaar hue hai ab echaare 30%, 20% or 10% tak ho saktaa he
 At the same time, reports are being received from reliable sources that 30 percent can be done in big cities, but it is not decided yet
 karmchaaree sanghathan kaa kahana rahaa he ki agar sarkaar ne echaare badhaayaa nahin he to gata kaise sakati hai
 In support of their argument, the workers argue that the rent of the house has come down in the cities
 kya makaan saste ho gaye hai
 When this has not happened how can the government do injustice to its employees
 bataa den ki vetan ayog (pe kamishan) ne apni report main echaare ko aarambh main 24%, 16% or 8% tay kiya tha or kaha gaya tha ki jab die 50 pratishat tak pahunch jayega to yah 27%, 18% or 9% kramash: ho jayega
 Not only this, the Pay Commission had also said that when DA becomes 100%, then the rate will be 30%, 20% and 10% for X, y and z cities respectively
 ullekhneey he ki karmchaariyon ke sanyukt sanghathan enzesie ne gathit vetan ayog ke samaksh apni maang se sambandhit gyaapan main is dar ko kramash: 60%, 40% or 20% karne ke liye kaha tha
 The organization alleges that the commission completely rejected the employees' demand
 unka kahana he ki vetan ayog ne is rate ko chathe vetan ayog se bhi kam kar diya he
 They say that because it is combined with DA, it will increase only when the DA rate increases by a fixed percentage
 tippaniyan For information, let us know that before the Seventh Pay Commission, central employees were entitled to 196 types of allowances
 lekin saatven vetan ayog ne kai alounces ko samaapt kar diya yaa phir unhen mila diya jiske baad keval 55 alouns baaki rah gaye
 Many employees are sorry for ending many allowances
 kyonki kai alouns abhi tak lagu nahin hue or karmchaariyon ko uskaa sidhaa laabh nahin mila he to karmchaariyon ko lag rahaa he ki vetan ayog kii report abhi lagu nahin hui
 Explain that there have been many complaints of employees from the report of the Seventh Pay Commission and in such a situation the Narendra Modi government of the Center has set up committees under the concerned Ministry and Ministry of Finance to address the grievances of its employees
 ye samitiyaan karmchaaree netaaon se baat kar rahi hai or is samitiyon ko apana faisla chaar maheene main sarkaar ko dena tha lekin abhi tak saat maheene se zyada samay biit chukaa he or abhi tak kisi bhi samiti ne apni report nahin saunpi he
 Sources say that even today a meeting of the committee is going to be held with the representatives of the employees
 is baithak main kya nirnay hoga, is bare main baithak ke baad pataa chalegaa
 The meeting time is scheduled for four o'clock in the evening
 jaankaree ke liye bataa den ki karmchaariyon ko echaare, tie-die ke saath-saath kai or alouns ke mudde par saatven vetan ayog kii siforeeshon par aapatti he
 It is noteworthy that the seventh pay commission has abolished many allowances that have been going on since the British rule
 saatven vetan ayog ne maujuud 196 alouns main adhiktar ko yaa to samaapt kar diya yaa phir use milakar keval 55 alouns rakhe hai
 To resolve the objections of the central employees on the recommendations of the Seventh Pay Commission, the government had constituted three committees which were authorized to interact with the employees' representatives on all issues
 in samitiyon main ek samiti vitt sachiv ashok lavasa ke netritv main banaai gai thi
 The same committee also had the issue of allowance
 pehle kaha ja rahaa tha ki farvari kii 22 taarikh ko is samiti kii antim baithak hui jisamen karmchaariyon se antim baar alouns ke mudde par charchaa kii gai thi
 Representatives of the NJCA, a joint organization of employees, joined to negotiate with the Allowance Committee
 (saatvaan vetan ayog : sansad main kendriya mantri ne bataaya samiti kii report main deree kaa ahm kaaran) It is believed that the government has divided the Transport Allowance (traveling Allowance) into two parts
 ek sisie or doosraa purvavat kii tarah diya jane vaala tie he
 It is believed that this will be payable like the Fifth Pay Commission
 yah bhi kaha ja rahaa he ki inako die se alag kar diya jayega or yah fiks slab rate par tay hoga
 It is also being said that the committee has accepted the demand of the employees to give the rate of HRA as per the report of the Sixth Pay Commission
 doosraa sabase ahm sawaal ab bhi bana hua he ki sarkaar ne echaare ko kab se dene kii baat ko sweekaar kiya he
 This question is still haunting the employees
 kya yah dar 1
 1
 16 se lagu kii gai he yaa phir 1
 4
 17 se yah lagu hogi
 As far as the employees are concerned, they have been demanding to implement it since January last year and some time ago there was a hint from the government that all the disputed allowances will be implemented from 1 April 2017
 jaankaree ke liye bataa den ki karmchaariyon kii maang he ki echaare ko puraane formule ke aadhaar par tay kiya jaae yaa phir isaki dar badhaai jaae
 Central employees say that currently HRA employees are getting less than earlier as per the fixed formula
 bataa den ki saatven vetan ayog (seventh Pay Commission) dwaara kendriya karmchaariyon ko die jane vaale kai bhatton ko lekar asamanjas kii sthiti he
 The Narendra Modi government had approved the recommendations of the 7th Pay Commission in 2016 and implemented the 7th Pay Commission report from 1 January 2016
 lekin, bhatton ke saath kai muddon par asahmati hone kii vajah se in siforishein puri tarah se lagu nahin ho pain
 It is being said that the officials authorized to negotiate on behalf of the government have agreed to raise the HRA to 1 level, now the HRA can be up to 30%, 20% and 10%
 vahiin, vishwasaneey sutron ke hawaale se khabar mil rahi he ki bade shaharon main ise 30 pratishat kiya ja saktaa he, lekin yah abhi tay nahin he
 The employees' organization has said that if the government has not increased the HRA, how can it be reduced
 apane tark ke samarthan main karmchaariyan kii daleel he ki kya shaharon main makaan kaa kiraaya kam hua he
 Have houses become cheap? jab yah nahin hua he to sarkaar apane karmchaariyon ke saath anyaay kaise kar sakati he
 Explain that the Pay Commission in its report had initially fixed the HRA as 24%, 16% and 8% and stated that when the DA reaches 50 percent it will be 27%, 18% and 9%
 Will be respectively
 itnaa hi nahin vetan ayog (pe kamishan) ne yah bhi kaha tha ki jab die 100% ho jayega tab yah dar 30%, 20% or 10% kramash : eks, vaai or jed shaharon ke liye ho jaaegi
 It is noteworthy that in the memorandum related to their demand before the pay commission constituted by the joint organization of employees, NJCA asked for this rate to be 60%, 40% and 20% respectively
 sanghathan kaa aarope he ki ayog ne karmchaariyon kii maang ko puri tarah se thukraa diya tha
 He says that the Pay Commission has reduced this rate from the Sixth Pay Commission
 inkaa kahana he ki kyonki ise die ke saath joda gaya he to yah tabhi badhegaa jab die kii dar tay pratishat tak bad jaaegi
 The comments jaankaree ke liye bataa den ki saatvaan vetan ayog se pehle kendriya karmchaaree 196 kism ke alounces ke hakdaar the
 But the Seventh Pay Commission abolished or merged many allowances, leaving only 55 allowances left
 tamaam karmchaariyon ko kai alouns samaapt hone kaa malaal he
 Because many allowances have not been implemented yet and the employees have not received their direct benefits, the employees feel that the Pay Commission report is not yet implemented
 bataa den ki saatven vetan ayog kii report se karmchaariyon kii kai shikaayatein rahi hai or aise main centre kii narendra modi sarkaar ne apane karmchaariyon kii shikayaton ko dur karne ke liye sambandhit mantralay or vittamantralay ke adheen samitiyon kaa gathan kiya he
 These committees are talking to the staff leaders and these committees had to give their decision to the government in four months but till now more than seven months have passed and so far no committee has submitted its report
 saatven vetan ayog (seventh Pay Commission) kii siforeeshon par kendriya karmchaariyon kii aapattiyon ke niraakaran ke liye sarkaar ne sabhi muddon par baatcheet ke liye teen samitiyon ko gathan kiya tha jinako karmchaariyon ke pratinidhiyon se baatcheet ke liye adhikrut kiya gaya tha
 a committee was formed under the leadership of Finance Secretary Ashok Lavasa

 It is also being said that they will be separated from DA and this fix will be fixed at slab rate
 yah bhi kaha ja rahaa he ki samiti ne karmchaariyon kii maang ko maanate hue echaare kii dar ko chathe vetan ayog kii report ke hisaab se dene kii baat ko sweekaar kar liya he

 kyonki kai alouns abhi tak lagu nahin hue or karmchaariyon ko uskaa sidhaa laabh nahin mila he to karmchaariyon ko lag rahaa he ki vetan ayog kii report abhi lagu nahin hui
 Explain that there have been many complaints of employees from the report of the Seventh Pay Commission and in such a situation the Narendra Modi government of the Center has set up committees under the concerned Ministry and Ministry of Finance to address the grievances of its employees
 ye samitiyaan karmchaaree netaaon se baat kar rahi hai or is samitiyon ko apana faisla chaar maheene main sarkaar ko dena tha lekin abhi tak saat maheene se zyada samay biit chukaa he or abhi tak kisi bhi samiti ne apni report nahin saunpi he
 It is believed that the government has divided the Transport Allowance (traveling Allowance) into two parts
 ek sisie or doosraa purvavat kii tarah diya jane vaala tie he
 It is believed that this will be payable like the Fifth Pay Commission
 yah bhi kaha ja rahaa he ki inako die se alag kar diya jayega or yah fiks slab rate par tay hoga
 It is also being said that the committee has accepted the demand of the employees to give the rate of HRA as per the report of the Sixth Pay Commission
 doosraa sabase ahm sawaal ab bhi bana hua he ki sarkaar ne echaare ko kab se dene kii baat ko sweekaar kiya he
 This question is still haunting the employees
 kya yah dar 1
 1
 16 se lagu kii gai he yaa phir 1
 4
 17 se yah lagu hogi
 As far as the employees are concerned, they have been demanding to implement it since January last year and some time ago there was a hint from the government that all the disputed allowances will be implemented from 1 April 2017
 jaankaree ke liye bataa den ki karmchaariyon kii maang he ki echaare ko puraane formule ke aadhaar par tay kiya jaae yaa phir isaki dar badhaai jaae
 Central employees say that currently HRA employees are getting less than earlier as per the fixed formula
 bataa den ki saatven vetan ayog (seventh Pay Commission) dwaara kendriya karmchaariyon ko die jane vaale kai bhatton ko lekar asamanjas kii sthiti he
 The Narendra Modi government had approved the recommendations of the 7th Pay Commission in 2016 and implemented the 7th Pay Commission report from 1 January 2016
 lekin, bhatton ke saath kai muddon par asahmati hone kii vajah se in siforishein puri tarah se lagu nahin ho pain
 It is being said that the officials authorized to negotiate on behalf of the government have agreed to raise the HRA to 1 level, now the HRA can be up to 30%, 20% and 10%
 vahiin, vishwasaneey sutron ke hawaale se khabar mil rahi he ki bade shaharon main ise 30 pratishat kiya ja saktaa he, lekin yah abhi tay nahin he
 The employees' organization has said that if the government has not increased the HRA, how can it be reduced
 apane tark ke samarthan main karmchaariyan kii daleel he ki kya shaharon main makaan kaa kiraaya kam hua he
 Have houses become cheap? jab yah nahin hua he to sarkaar apane karmchaariyon ke saath anyaay kaise kar sakati he
 Explain that the Pay Commission in its report had initially fixed the HRA as 24%, 16% and 8% and stated that when the DA reaches 50 percent it will be 27%, 18% and 9%
 Will be respectively
 itnaa hi nahin vetan ayog (pe kamishan) ne yah bhi kaha tha ki jab die 100% ho jayega tab yah dar 30%, 20% or 10% kramash : eks, vaai or jed shaharon ke liye ho jaaegi
 It is noteworthy that in the memorandum related to their demand before the pay commission constituted by the joint organization of employees, NJCA asked for this rate to be 60%, 40% and 20% respectively
 sanghathan kaa aarope he ki ayog ne karmchaariyon kii maang ko puri tarah se thukraa diya tha
 He says that the Pay Commission has reduced this rate from the Sixth Pay Commission
 inkaa kahana he ki kyonki ise die ke saath joda gaya he to yah tabhi badhegaa jab die kii dar tay pratishat tak bad jaaegi
 The comments jaankaree ke liye bataa den ki saatvaan vetan ayog se pehle kendriya karmchaaree 196 kism ke alounces ke hakdaar the
 But the Seventh Pay Commission abolished or merged many allowances, leaving only 55 allowances left
 tamaam karmchaariyon ko kai alouns samaapt hone kaa malaal he
 Because many allowances have not been implemented yet and the employees have not received their direct benefits, the employees feel that the Pay Commission report is not yet implemented
 bataa den ki saatven vetan ayog kii report se karmchaariyon kii kai shikaayatein rahi hai or aise main centre kii narendra modi sarkaar ne apane karmchaariyon kii shikayaton ko dur karne ke liye sambandhit mantralay or vittamantralay ke adheen samitiyon kaa gathan kiya he
 These committees are talking to the staff leaders and these committees had to give their decision to the government in four months but till now more than seven months have passed and so far no committee has submitted its report
 yah bhi kaha ja rahaa he ki samiti ne karmchaariyon kii maang ko maanate hue echaare kii dar ko chathe vetan ayog kii report ke hisaab se dene kii baat ko sweekaar kar liya he
 The second most important question still remains as to how long the government has agreed to give the HRA
 yah prashn abhi bhi karmchaariyon ko sata rahaa he
 Does this rate 1
 1
 16 or 1 is applied
 4
 With effect from 17, it will be applicable
 jahaan tak karmchaariyon kaa sawaal he vah ise pichley saal janvari se lagu karwaane kii maang karte rahe hai or sarkaar kii ore se kuch samay pehle aisa ishaara mila tha ki sabhi vivaadit alouns ko 1 april 2017 se lagu kiya jayega
 For information, let us tell that the demand of employees is that HRA should be decided on the basis of the old formula or its rate should be increased
 kendriya karmchaariyon kaa kahana he ki vartmaan main tay formula ke hisaab se echaare karmchaariyon ko pehle kii tulana main kam milane laga he
 Let me tell you that there is confusion about many allowances given to the Central Employees by the Seventh Pay Commission
 narendra modi sarkaar ne 2016 main saatven vetan ayog (7th Pay Commission) kii siforeeshon ko manjuuri di thi or 1 janvari 2016 se 7wein vetan ayog kii report ko lagu kiya tha
 However, due to disagreement on several issues with allowances, these recommendations were not fully implemented
 kaha ja rahaa he ki sarkaar kii ore se baatcheet ke liye adhikrut adhikari echaare ko 1 str upar karne ko taiyaar hue hai ab echaare 30%, 20% or 10% tak ho saktaa he
 At the same time, reports are being received from reliable sources that 30 percent can be done in big cities, but it is not decided yet
 karmchaaree sanghathan kaa kahana rahaa he ki agar sarkaar ne echaare badhaayaa nahin he to gata kaise sakati hai
 In support of their argument, the workers argue that the rent of the house has come down in the cities
 kya makaan saste ho gaye hai
 When this has not happened how can the government do injustice to its employees
 bataa den ki vetan ayog (pe kamishan) ne apni report main echaare ko aarambh main 24%, 16% or 8% tay kiya tha or kaha gaya tha ki jab die 50 pratishat tak pahunch jayega to yah 27%, 18% or 9% kramash: ho jayega
 Not only this, the Pay Commission had also said that when DA becomes 100%, then the rate will be 30%, 20% and 10% for X, y and z cities respectively
 ullekhneey he ki karmchaariyon ke sanyukt sanghathan enzesie ne gathit vetan ayog ke samaksh apni maang se sambandhit gyaapan main is dar ko kramash: 60%, 40% or 20% karne ke liye kaha tha
 The organization alleges that the commission completely rejected the employees' demand
 unka kahana he ki vetan ayog ne is rate ko chathe vetan ayog se bhi kam kar diya he
 They say that because it is combined with DA, it will increase only when the DA rate increases by a fixed percentage
 tippaniyan For information, let us know that before the Seventh Pay Commission, central employees were entitled to 196 types of allowances

 Stress is caused by incorrect posture

 On Friday evening, 30-year-old research analyst Ankit came to my clinic working in a Mumbai-based finance company
 usne gardan main tej dard kii baat kahi
 His muscles were so stiff that he could not even lift the head directly
 poochne par usne bataaya ki use dinabhar kursi par baithe rahakar kai monitoron ko ek saath dekhnaa hota he
 He has to take data from those monitors placed at different heights and insert it into his computer
 chunki lagaataar upar dekhte rahanaa hota he, isliye gardan or peeth main dard rahata he
 He would have taken a painkiller for immediate relief, but what happened that day suddenly caused a sudden neck stroke due to continuous work throughout the week
 ankit kii tarah aise kai log hai jo apane desktop, laptop, smartphone or teb se chipke rahete hai jiskaa asar unki deh par padataa he
 The muscles swell, the back hurts and the neck swells, the wrists ache
 yah sab lambey samay tak kursi par baithkar kaam karne waalon ke saath aisa saamaanya rup se hota he
 Such people do a lot of exercise at the end of the week to give some relief to their lifestyle
 isse unke kandhon or ghutanon kii mansapeshiyon main chot aa jaati he
 After looking at Ankit i found that her neck muscles had become compressed causing her to stiffen
 ganimat he ki iske baavjood use spondilitis yaa discs kii shikaayat nahin hui
 What really happens to people like Ankit is that during work, the smooth movement of his body is affected
 shuruyaat main ve sahi tareeke se kursi par baithte hai lekin jaise-jaise mansapeshiyaan thakti jaati hai ve kursi par letne kii mudra main aa jate hai
 Due to the hip being bent, the bend of the spine near the waist is pulled
 is sthiti main koi yadi apni gardan ko tivi yaa computer ke hisaab se ek kone par modta he to ridh ajibo garib sthiti main aa jaati he
 If this posture lasts for a long time, the muscles become imbalanced
 ridh kii haddi main discs khatre main pad jaati he or spondilitis kaa jokhim bad jaataa he
 People flirt with pain because they have forgotten to use their body
 sahi mudra main baithne ke prashikshan ke liye jaagrukta kii jarurat hoti he
 If you are conscious about your health then you can solve such problem immediately

 When the SP government of Uttar Pradesh banned the resolution day of Vishwa Hindu Parishad, BJP Siddharth Nath Singh got so angry that he made objectionable statements
 unhone kaha ki uttar pradesh ko pakistan na banaaen akhilesh yadav
 In fact, when asked about the ban imposed on Sankalp Nath Singh, Siddharth Nath Singh said, 'there has always been a communal policy and intention of the Samajwadi Party
 jo vot bank ke liye mujffarnagar main dange karvaa den
 Suspend an IAS officer in the guise of communalism
 wo sadhu-santon ke upar paband lagaaye isamen aashcharya kii baat nahin
 Because they see a vote bank
 'unhone aage kaha, 'ham akhilesh yadav ko itnaa bataanaa chaahate hai ki wo uttar pradesh ko pakistan banane kaa prayaas karenge to upi kii janata use kabuulegi nahin or na hi aisa hone degi
 Congress leader Harish Rawat condemned this objectionable statement of Siddharth Nath Singh
 unhone kaha ki is tarah bayaan dena sahi nahin he
 Accusing the BJP of spoiling up's atmosphere, he said, 'uttar Pradesh has created a deliberately tense atmosphere

 a post shared by KK (@therealkarismakapoor) on Dec 20, 2017 at 2:58 am PSTA little forest for Taimur a little boy can never have enough of birds, bees and butterflies and so we have put together a small forest as a birthday gift for the little big boy, Taimur, in Sonave
 It’s a special forest, one that thrives on intercropping and i hope that as he grows he too will thrive in and celebrate a diverse society
 a society where people live together and due to their distinctions
 The forest has about 100 trees on a 1000 sq ft plot
 The trees are as young as Taimur, even younger actually, and each one of them is a local, native, climate resilient specie
 It will be a forest of the super foods of the future
 There are 3 jamuns, 1 jackfruit, 1 amla, 40 Bananas, 14 Moringas, 1 Kokum, 1 Papaya, 5 Seetaphal, 2 Ramphals, 2 Nimbu trees
 Besides these it grows 3 different types of native pulses and many Mirchi, Ginger, Turmeric and kari patta plants
 Not to mention the green leafy veggies and the genda phools that grow in between
 The forest is inspired by Padma Shri Subhash Palekar’s zero budget natural farming where one tree grows symbiotically off another and thus is thrifty on one’s pocket
 The forest will become a home for pollinating agents like the butterflies, bees, birds and earthworms
 It will help nurture the soil, fix back the nitrogen and minerals in the soil that it grows on, preserve the water table and look elegant and beautiful while doing it all
 Here's to living sustainably! Happy Birthday

 But in the last three years, the study of all the 24 accidents that this water power has faced, says that the roots of the problem are far deeper
 netritv ke sankat se lekar lagaataar badhati nigaraanee kii bhoomika tak, nausena is samay apane sabase bade shaantikalin sankat se guzar rahi he
 This may sound strange, but the Indian Navy in fact has the distinction of having the ability to maintain, operate and exploit boats and warships for much longer than their fixed lives
 vishaal nausena bhawan ke gailaree room main baithe hue, jahaan anjali ila menon ke pandrah saal puraane ek mural ko haal hi main phir se durust kiya gaya he, robin ke naam se lokapriy admiral aar
 K
 dhovan ienes viraat kaa udhaaharan dete hai
 For a long time it was India's only warship
 sainya seva main pehali baar shaamil kiye jane ke 55 saal baad bhi yah jahaaj aaj tak pani par tair rahaa he
 "like any big navy, we have a consignment of old warships but we have been running them for many years and have been running from the point of view," Dhowan told India Today
 ’’yakeenan, teenon sainya balon main se sabase choti-nausena puraane plateformon se ghiri hui he
 From submarines to warships and frequently ignored auxiliary boats, the navy itself calculates that at any time about half of its fleet is more than 20 years old
 lekin haal ke varshon main pani kii is fouj ko pareshaan karne vaale kai haadason kii vajah kya sirf yah he? nahin, or is nahin par nausena ke bheetar or baahar ke hitdharakon main lagbhag aam raay he
 Let's look at some facts
 pichley teen saal main nausena ko 24 badi durghatnaon kaa shikaar hona padaa
 a record 14 incidents of these, Admiral D
 as Chief of the Navy
 ke
 Joshi's 18-month tenure
 lekin in ghatnaon kii prakruti kaa vishleshan kiya jaae (dekhen graphic) to yah hakeekat saamne aati he ki inamen se zyaadaatar main kisi saamaanya masini yaa material kii kharabi kii bajaae kahin choti to kahin badi beparwahee yaa maanviya bhul kaa haath tha
 Although the investigation into eight accidents is yet to be completed, the Navy has initiated disciplinary action against 67 employees, including 49 officers, for the negligence responsible for these accidents
 in haadason main ek jahaaj ke duubakar samudr kii talahati main samaa jane se lekar pandubbi ke aag se swaha ho jane tak sab shaamil hai
 The Chief of the Navy has also given a firm indication that this is the Navy's biggest casualty
 18 logon kii jaan lene vaala ienes sindhurakshak pandubbi main hua visphot kai ghatnaon kaa nateeja tha jinamein parichaalan prakriya kii kotahi ke saath-saath pandubbi main maujuud visphotakon kii dekh-rekh ke suraksha upayon main chook bhi shaamil thi
 Although the people sitting in the system are hesitant to label it as such, but the reality is that the Navy is struggling with leadership crisis
 nigahabaani yaa kaman main chook ke kai udhaaharan hai
 From the advance-class amphibious warship INS Airavat, which damaged its propeller when it entered Visakhapatnam port in January, to the sword and quiver that struck two separate accidents in the same week in December last year, the Navy concluded But it is reached that most of the incidents involve some serious human flaw
 kai main nausanchaalan sambandhi buniyadi kaushal yaa ilaake ko lekar jaagrukta kaa abhaav dikhaa
 So either half-incomplete training is visible in them or career growth which is not given proper direction
 jaankaar log bataate hai ki khamiyaan kisi jahaaj ke pani main utarane se pehle hi shuru ho jaati hai
 An officer of Majhle rank admitted, "dockyard officials tell a ship to be able to land knowing that there are many problems in it
" kai shuruaati jaruri jaanch to sirf kaagajon par hoti hai
 Forget the standards of walking and fighting on water, many ships do not meet the standards of swimming
 ’’ ve aage kehete hai ki suraksha prakriyaaon kii aksar andekhi kar di jaati he kyonki agar sari jaanch pakke taur par kii jaaen to ‘‘kai jahaajon ke liye pani par utarana hi mushkil ho jayega
 "the old ship is not necessarily worthless, but a poorly maintained ship can be risky
" ek anya sevarat nausena adhikari ne kaha, ‘‘commander-in-chif apane adhiktar jahaajon ko samudr main dekhnaa chahta he
 The captain knows that his career depends on whether his ship floats
 ise hasil karne ke liye kai shortkat istemaal kar liye jate hai jinke ghaatak nattejey hote hai
 The Navy is also acutely aware of this problem
 darasal, kai sari badi durghatnaon ke baad usne ‘‘sudhaaron’’ kii jo fehrist taiyaar kii he, usamen suraksha jaanch or prakriyaaon par ‘‘buniyadi ahmiyat’’ ko variyata par rakhaa gaya he
 Admiral Dhowan says, "we have set procedures and standards for all tasks
 hamen samiksha kerani hogi or is baat ko pukhta taur par saamne rakhana hoga ki in suraksha pahaluon kaa ulanghan nahin kiya jaae, suraksha audit samay par kiye jaaen or tamaam prakriyaaon kaa sakhti se paalan kiya jaae
 "while these issues have been accumulating layer by layer over the years, they have resulted in accidents and accidents in recent years when the workload on the Navy suddenly increased
" mumbai par 2008 ke aatankwaadi hamalon ke baad, nausena kii bhoomika samudr main pehle kii tulana main kaaphi bad gai
 The naval coastal responsibilities have increased manifold, ranging from blind races to active action on more robust intelligence, based on repeated messages received from fishermen's boats
 purv nausena pramukh admiral arun prakaash kehete hai, ‘‘nausena kii parichaalan sakriyata 2008 ke baad se lagaataar bad rahi he, jisase jangi jahaajon or nausena karmiyon par atirikt dabaav bad gaya he
 The Navy says that in terms of percentage, the burden of patrolling and missions on its warships and aircraft has increased by at least 75 percent in the last few years
 yah parichaalanaatmak boj lagaataar badhata hi jayega
 There are many challenges on the personnel front too
 udhaaharan ke taur par us mudde par antarnihit asantosh ko len jise ‘‘sona (esoene) prakriya’’ kaha jaataa he
 Informally addressed, Sona includes junior and mid-level officers who are directly associated with commanders and senior leaders, who are believed to have priority in posting and promotion
 tantra ke bheetar maujuud kai adhikari is baat kii shikaayat karte hai ki ab nausena main kariyar main aage baduya in rishton par zyada nirbhar rahata he or khalis profeshnal aadhaar par kam
 The ray of light in these problems is that the Navy is now showing an open attitude towards accepting these issues and working towards resolving them
 haal hi main ukt 24 ghatnaon kii vrihad suchi ko saarvajanik karnaa pehle kii use nazarandaaj karne vaali paripati se alag he jisamen nausena kisi dikkat ke hone kii baat ko maanane se hi inkaar kar detii thi
 Director of the Society for Policy Studies c
 udai bhaskar kehete hai, ‘‘nausena ko flag officers ke str par milakar baithna hoga
 Many navies of the world have faced similar crises and an objective review can take everyone forward
 ’’yakeenan nausena badlaav ke muhane par he or aane vaale varshon main, jabaki vyapaar or arthvyavastha nirnaayak honge, vah bharat ke vaishvik prabhutv kaa ahm aujaar banegi
 In this case, the faster she will fix herself, the sooner she will be able to assume this role

 1988 ke gaiyr iradatan hatya maamle main purv cricketer or congress netaa navjot singh siddhu kii museebataan kam hone kaa naam nahin le rahi hai
 In a hearing on the road rage case in the Supreme Court on Thursday, the counsel for the Punjab government said that Sidhu was involved in the case, he should be punished
 saath hi yachikakarta ne supreme court main kaha ki punjab or haryana hoicourt dwaara di gai teen saal kii sajaa bhi barkaraar rahane dena chahie
 The Punjab government lawyer defended the conviction of the two accused, saying that the Punjab and Haryana High Court had convicted Sidhu and should be punished
 unhone kaha ki siddhu dwaara court main diya gaya bayaan galat he jisamen unhone khud kaa bachaav kiya tha
 During the hearing, the Supreme Court questioned how accused number two Rupinder Sandhu was charged, even though his name was not included in the FIR
 saath hi court ne poocha ki siarpisi es 313 ke tahat siddhu ke bayaan par vishwaas kyon nahin kiya ja saktaa
 During the hearing, the counsel for the Punjab government said that Navjot Singh Sidhu was convicted by the High Court in this 1988 road rage case, so he should be punished
 haalanki, court ne kaha ki is maamle kii agali sunwaayee mangalvaar ko hogi
 During the hearing in the Supreme Court on Wednesday on the petition of former cricketer and MP Navjot Singh Sidhu, the complainant said that a case of murder was made against Sidhu not of negligent death
 kyonki siddhu ko ye pataa tha ki wo kya kar rahe hai
 They did what they thought they did, so they should be tried for murder
 shikayatakarta ne kaha ki kaha ki agar ye road rej kaa maamla hota to hit karte or maukey se bhaag jate
 But here, Sidhu first pulled them out of the car and punched them loudly
 wo thappad maar sakate the yaa phir pairon par maar sakate the
 But here, he deliberately punched the head and also took out the key of the car
 shikayatakarta ne ye bhi kaha ki court ne apane ek faisle main 35 saal baad saamne aae saboot ko record par lene kaa aadesh diya tha
 The same can be done in this case as the complainant has just received a CD of Sidhu's interview on a private channel
 haalanki, mangalvaar ko siddhu kii taraf se shikayatakarta kii us yachika kaa virodh kiya gaya jisamen shikayatakarta ne 1988 road rej maamle main ek nai yachika daakhil kar aarope lagaaya he ki saal 2010 main ek nijee channel par die apane intervyuu main siddhu ne ye mana tha ki wo is aparaadh ke liye doshi hai
 It was said on behalf of Sidhu that the Supreme Court is currently hearing the appeal
 lihaaja ise record par nahin rakhaa ja saktaa he, aise main agar ye yachika daakhil hi karnaa chaahate hai to nichali adaalat yaa hoicourt main daakhil karen
 Former cricketer Navjot Singh Sidhu was sentenced to three years in the punjab-haryana High Court by convicting Sidhu in the case of culpable homicide
 jiske khilaaf unhone supreme court main yachika daakhil kiya tha or court ne unke doshi tehraae jane par bhi roak laga di thi
 Sidhu may have to resign
 The Akali Dal has directly demanded his resignation after the Punjab government's counsel sought to uphold the High Court verdict on Sidhu
 akali dal ne kaha ki supreme court ke faisle ke baad bhi navjot singh siddhu ko istipha dena hi padegaa
 In the next hearing, if the Supreme Court upholds the decision of the Punjab and Haryana High Court and the sentence continues for 3 years, then in such a case Sidhu may have to lose his ministerial position
 duusari ore, akali dal ne sidhe taur par siddhu se turant prabhaav se model ground par istipha dene kii maang kii he, vahiin bhaajapa ne bhi siddhu ke khilaaf bayaan dene shuru kar die hai, haalanki agali taarikh par abhi supreme court main sunwaayee baaki he, lekin unke raajnneetik virodhiyon ne morchabandi shuru kar di he
 What is the matter? Actually, Haryana and Punjab High Court sentenced him in 2006 for a 1988 murder case
 1988 main unka gurunam singh naam ke ek shaks se jhagada hua tha
 The man was killed after the assault
 hoicourt ne unhen teen saal jail kii sajaa sunai thi
 He had been in jail for several days
 2007 main supreme court ne siddhu ko raahat dete hue hai court ke faisle par roak laga di thi

 That is, a clap that has never been recognized in society
 jinaki duaen paane ke liye logon main ichha jarur he, lekin unhen dekhakar dur hat jane vaale logon kii lambii jamaat bhi hamaare samaaj main maujuud he
 Pradeep Saurabh's pen has exposed this truth in his second book 'teertha Tali' after 'munni Mobile'
 yah kitaab ubhayalingi, hijadon or lesbian kii haashiye par basar ho rahi jindagi kii kahani bayaan karti he
 What comes out after reading the book is that such people have a bigger crisis in the society than their own identity
 kinnaron kaa jivan kya he or kaise guzar-basar hota he, isi par aadhaarit he teesri tali
 The third clap has loneliness, which can be seen in the lives of all the characters
 yah hindi kaa ek saahsee upanyaas he, jo gender ko lekar samaaj main maujuud algaav ko darshata he
 The commentary of Pakanj Pachauri written on the book's flap is very accurate
 vah kehete hai, 'yah ubhayalingi saamaajik duniya ke bich or barakes hinjadon, laundon, laundebaajon, lesbianon or vikrut-prakruti kii aisi duniya he jo har shahar main maujuud he or samaaj ke haashiye par jindagi jiti rahi he
 'the story begins with the character of Gautam Saheb, who had a son, but he does not open the door even after playing a third clap of eunuchs
 kyonki gautam sahab, anandi antee ke kirdaaron ne un maa-baap kaa dard bhi bayaan kiya he, jinhen baccha hone par khushi manaane kaa haq bachche ke ling par nirbhar karata he
 If the child is bisexual then it is a great sin
 jise duniya se bachaate-chhipate gautam sahab, anandi antee apni jindagi ke kai saal to katate hai
 But society makes their pain ulcer over time, ending in acts like suicide
 yun to har kirdaar bahut hi bakhubi se ek nae sach or dard ko bayaan karata he, lekin sabase ant tak ek kirdaar jeevant hokar bhi mrit hone kii kahani bayaan karata he wo he vineet, nahin vineeta
 Yes, this is the unfinished truth of his life which also makes him successful
 lekin use de jaataa he jivan kaa khalipan
 The last page of the book ends on the story of Vijay, a journalist
 sari duniya ke saamne anyaay kii ladaai ladane or har jokhim uthaane kaa usamen jajba he
 But there is a truth which he keeps hidden from the world and this is the reason why he is counted among the respected people in the society
 lekin ant main vah sach kahata he ki vah ek mukammal purush nahin balki hijdaa he
 The story ends with the book's last page, but raises many such questions on society
 jiske chalate ek tabake kii jindagi nark ban chuki he
 Many interesting things also come out in this novel, the general class is completely oblivious
 jaise ki hijde jinase shaadi karte hai yaa kahen jinhen apana pati maanate hai unhen giria kehete hai
 They also name Karvachauth
 kai baar hijde shaadi nahin karte lekin ek din kii suhagan banakar duusare din vidhwaa jarur ban jate hai
 This is the practice about which the Kuvagam fair begins
 yah mela tamilnadu ke villoopuram main yojit hota he
 Thousands of eunuchs come from all over the country in this fair
 rishte-naate se dur rahane vaale teesri yoni ke ye logon ko yahaan ek din ke liye suhagan banane kaa mauka miltaa he
 In this way the wish of their marriage is fulfilled
 yah rasm yahaan khatm nahin hoti kyonki iske baad mangalsutra todane kii rasm hoti he or saare hijde vidhwaa hone ke vilaap main lag jate hai
 Everybody participates in this ritual
 agar kisi ne is parampara ko todane kii jurrat bhi kii to parinaam behad gambhir hote hai
 The writer has touched the lives of those who identify as the third gender in society so closely that there is hardly any fiber that does not touch hands
 sabase khaas baat yah he ki is samaaj main jise ham samaaj kaa hissaa nahin maanate unki apni samasyaayein hai
 Such as the problem of the succession of the throne when the eunuch becomes old, due to the customs of modern society the eunuchs join the sex racket
 yah hindi kaa ek saahsee upanyaas he, jo gender ke akelepan or gender ke algaav ke baavjood samaaj se jeene kii lalak se bharpoor duniya kaa parichay karaata he
 There are many such truths in life, which we believe or not, but they have their own existence, because they have not even got the seal of the society, but time has definitely imposed a timeless seal

 Yechury said, 'the way Arun Jaitley has described the entire movement as bjp's victory is sad
 jail jane se pehle chaatro ne tirangaa laharaate hue jai hind kaa naaraa lagaaya tha or waapas aane ke baad bhi vahiin kiya
 The question here is not of victory, but of a battle of ideas
 kya ham ek secular ganatantr hai yaa phir ise hindu raashtra banane ja rahe hai?'yechuri ne yah bhi kaha ki communist loktantr ke khilaaf nahin he
 Those who think so are wrong
 unhone kaha, 'sarkaar kii policy hi nahin he ki pakistan se sambandh sudharen
 If that were the case, raising slogans of Pakistan Zindabad would not be considered anti-national
 agar koi bharat-murdaabaad ke naare lagaataa he to vah desh virdohi hoga
 Questioning Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Yechury said that the kind of attitude the government had in the JNU case, Kanhaiya was a result of that

 ' ek samachar portal ne ek sting oparation main daawa kiya ki sarkaar 1984 ke sikh viradhi dangon ko rokane ke liye kadam uthaane main naakaam rahi or varisht police adhikariyon ne sikhon ko sabak sikhaane ke liye tatkaaleen sarkaar ke saath sathganth kii
 The sting claims the confession of Delhi Police officials, most of whom have admitted their failure as a force to take action against the culprits in the sting
 sting main kalyanpuri ke tatkaaleen thana prabharee (esechao) shoorveer singh tyaagi, dilli chhavnee ke esechao rohtas singh, krishna nagar ke esechao esen bhaskar, shrinivasapuri ke esechao opi yadav or mahrauli ke echechao jaipal singh kii baatcheet record he
 The news portal claimed that the then police chief SC Tandon easily deferred all questions while the then Additional Commissioner of Police Gautam Kaul denied that he had any direct knowledge of the riots
 daawa kiya gaya he ki in adhikariyon kii sweekaarokti khulaasa karti he ki varisht adhikariyon ne sikhon ke khilaaf sampradayik bhavanaaen dhire-dhire bhadakne kii chetavaniyon ko ansuna kiya or police niyantran kaksh ko milane vaale aagjanee evam dangon ke samaacharon ke keval do pratishat sandeshon ko hi darj kiya gaya
 The policemen were afraid of the transfer, as well as the claim that the logbook was conveniently changed to erase the evidence of senior officials not taking action, while some other officers did not take action for fear of being sentenced for transfer
 sarkaar ne police ko karrwai karne kii ijaajat nahin di or yah dharna banaai ki police apana kaam nahin kar rahi thi
 Indira's cheers were not acted upon, the portals claimed that according to the confessions of these officers, some police officers threw the bodies of the victims elsewhere to reduce the crimes related to the riots and messages were circulated instructing the police that they Do not take action against the rioters who were raising slogans of Indira Gandhi Zindabad
 aam aadmi party ke netaa sanjay singh ne dilli se vidhayak naresh yadav ko saazish kaa shikaar bataate hue galat aaropon ke liye bijepi or akali dal se maafi maangane ko kaha
 Sanjay Singh said that the leaders of Akali Dal and Bharatiya Janata Party in Punjab are misusing the police for their personal politics
 tazaa maamle main saamne aae sach se yah sabit bhi ho jaataa he jisamen aap vidhayak naresh yadav ko jhuthe bayaan ke aadhaar par fansaane kii koshish kii gai thi
 In Malerkotla, an RSS pracharak who disrespected the Quran, confessed that the police had pressurized him to falsely accuse the Aam Aadmi Party MLA Naresh Yadav of the Aam Aadmi Party for making a false allegation against the AAP MLA
 They could register a case and arrest him
 sangh prachaarak ko aisa naa karne par uske kilaaf dhara 302 or 307 kaa mukadmaa darj karne kii dhamkee di gai or aap vidhayak ke khilaaf jabaran usase bayaan dilvaaya gaya
 This proves that the AAP leaders and workers are being falsely prosecuted by the Badal family and the Bharatiya Janata Party police using their inappropriate means
 shuukravaar ko dilli sthit aam aadmi party ke rashtriya karyaalay main yojit press conference main bolte hue party ke rashtriya pravaktaa or punjab prabharee sanjay singh ne kaha ki 'jab bhartiya janata party dilli main aam aadmi party vidhayakon ke kilaaf jhuthe mukademe darj karavaate-karavaate thak gai to bhartiya janata party or akali dal ne punjab police kaa sahaara lekar dilli ke vidhayakon ke kilaaf mukademe lagavaana shuru kar diya
 Naresh Yadav, MLA from Mehrauli, Delhi of the Aam Aadmi Party, was wrongly dragged in the case of the Koran's absurdity, the lie of which has now been veiled
 punjab prabharee sanjay singh ne saath hi kaha ki 'ab jab yah saafe ho chukaa he ki quran kii brudabi ke maamle main aap vidhayak naresh yadav par farzi or jhootha mukadmaa darj kiya gaya tha to kya ab bhartiya janata party or congress ke ve netaa or kaaryakarta jinhone us vakt dilli ke mukhyamantri awaas par or aam aadmi party ke karyaalay ke saamne pradarshan kiya tha, ab wo janata ke bich jaakar vidhayak naresh yadav or aadmi party se maafi maangenge?'unhone kaha ki ham desh kii janata ko yah bataanaa chaahate hai ki ham is desh main bhaichaare kii raajnneeti karte hai lekin bhartiya janata party is desh main nafrat kii raajnneeti karti he
 BJP works to fight people on the basis of religion and castes, but the Aam Aadmi Party works with everyone by establishing brotherhood among all the religions and castes of the society
 punjab main bhi bhartiya janata party or badal parivaar apane isi nafrat failaane vaale agenda ke tahat hi kaam kar rahe hai or aam aadmi party punjab kii behatari ke liye prayasarat he
 'it may be noted that the main accused Vijay Kumar, who came out on bail in the case of the absurdity of a religious book in Malerkotla, Punjab, made a big disclosure giving a clean chit to AAP MLA Naresh Yadav from Delhi
 vijay ne bataaya ki usne apana pehla bayaan police ke dabaav kii vajah se diya tha or police ne jabardastee use aam aadmi party vidhayak naresh yadav ko is cese main fansaane ke liye kaha tha
 Senior leaders of the Aam Aadmi Party have strongly objected to this
 shuukravaar ko chandigarh main press conference karke aam aadmi party ke punjab kanvinar gurprit ghuggi or khud mahrauli se vidhayak naresh yadav ne punjab kii badal sarkaar par aam aadmi party ko punjab chunaav se pehle badnaam karne kii sajeesh rachane kaa aarope lagaaya
 The Indian Institute of Mass Communication (IIMC) has ordered the expulsion of a student from the hostel for three weeks for making 'objectionable and derogatory' remarks on social media against students belonging to scheduled castes and scheduled tribes
 iske saath hi angreji paathyakram ke ek dalit chaatr ko bhi whatsapp ke ek group par santhaan kii ek shikshika ke khilaaf ‘abhadra evam ashleel bhashaa’ ke istemaal ke liye santhaan ke hostel se ek hafte ke liye nishkasit kiya gaya he

 congress netaaon ne bhi sapa main mache ghamaasan ke dauraan kai baar ishaaron-ishaaron main akhilesh ke samarthan kaa elaan kiya
 Only Kapil Sibal, a well-known lawyer and senior Congress leader came to the Election Commission to defend Akhilesh
 akhilesh ne kiya tha 143 siton kaa vaadzkhilesh ke saath congress kii hamadardi puri tarah se siyaasi phaayde se judi hui thim
 According to Congress sources, Akhilesh had given written consent to form an alliance with the Congress and leave 143 seats for it
 duusari ore mulaayam singh yadav congress ke saath kisi bhi tarah ke gathbandhan ke khilaaf the
 This is the reason that Congress supported Akhilesh in this father-son fight
 cycle kabjate hi badal gaye akhileshchunaav ayog ne jaise hi cycle or sapa par akhilesh ke kabje ko jaij tehraaya upi ke mukhyamantri kaa rukh badal gaya
 He got involved in bargaining for seats with the Congress and it was here that Rahul Gandhi defeated himself in the politics from novice Akhilesh
 akhilesh baar-baar siton kii sankhya ghataate rahe or congress usapar apni rajamandi kii muhar lagaati rahi
 Akhilesh's strongest bet was when he released a list of his candidates while the Congress was in talks
 akhilesh kii ore se congress ko antim ofer 100 siton kaa mila
 Rahularrahul, who was worried about Akhilesh's washerman, now had no choice but to obey Akhilesh
 aisa isliye bhi kyonki congress sapa se gathbandhan ko lekar nishcint baithi thi or jis samay basapa or bijepi ke sambhavit pratyaashee apane-apane chunaav kshetron main party kii hawa banane main jute the us samay congress ke ummidavaar gharon main baithkar sapa kii ladaai thamane or siton ke bantwaare par muhar lagane ke intjaar main baithe the
 That is, even if the Congress tried to contest elections on its own, it would be like fighting a losing battle for it
 priyanka or sonia kii entry se sanbhalee batise samay main jabaki lag rahaa tha kicongress or sapa kaa gathbandhaub nahin hoga party adhyaksh sonia gandhi or priyanka ne aage badhkar morcha sambhala
 Sources reveal that while Priyanka spoke directly to Akhilesh, Sonia also tried to get the veteran leaders of other parties close to mulayam-akhilesh to intervene in the matter and bring the alliance to its end
 ye sonia-priyanka kii sakriyata kaa hi asar tha ki kuch ghanton baad hi donon partiyon ke bich gathbandhan par muhar lagi or 105 siten paakar congress apni naak bachaane main kisi tarah safal ho pai
 In the past, the entire alliance of rahul-sp-congress alliance has already been tried in the case of alliance, but the message has been conveyed, but this has sent the message that even a small decision of Rahul Gandhi's politics has reached its own end He could not reach even when his relationship with Akhilesh Yadav is not the same as it was with RJD President Lalu Prasad Yadav
 2010 ke bihar vidhansabha chunaav main nitish kumaar or bijepi ke majboot gathbandhan se muqabla karne ke liye rahul gandhi ke paas argedy adhyaksh lalu prasad yadav or algepi ke ramvilas paswan se gathbandhan kaa vikalp tha lekin rahul chunaav main congress ko akele le gaye
 As a result, the Congress was reduced to 6 seats in Bihar
 loksabhaa chunaav main argedy se rahul ne gathbandhan to kiya lekin lalu prasad yadav ke saath manch par nahin chadhe, haalanki bihar ke pichley vidhansabha chunaav main congress ne galati sudhari or nateeja ye hua ki wo sattarudh gathbandhan kaa hissaa he

 Tuesday means the day of worship of Hanuman and to offer his beloved things to him to please him
 aksar hi dekha jaataa he ki hanuman ji ko sindur chadhaaya jaataa he or kai log mannath puri hone ke baad bhi hanumanji par sindur chadhaate hai
 Do you know why this is done? What is the reason or legend behind the sindoor offering? If not, know what the scriptures say and why Hanuman ji is vermillion
 
 
 ramayana main prasiddh he ek kathashri hanuman ji ne jagajanani shri sita ji ke maang main sindur laga dekhakar aashcharyapurvak poocha- mata! aapane yah laal dravya mastak par kyon lagaaya he? sita ji ne brahmacharihanuman kii is sidhi-saadi batpar prasann hokar kaha, putr! iske lagane se mere swami kii dderghaayu hoti he or vah mujh par prasann rahete hai
 Shree Hanuman heard this and was very happy and thought that when applying finger to vermilion increases Ayushya, then why not ship it on the whole body and make my master immortal
 hanuman ji ne vaisaa hi kiya
 When the vermilion of all the bodies reached the Potkar Sabha, the Lord laughed and was very happy to see them
 hanuman ji ko mata janaki ke vachanon main or adhik drudh vishwaas ho gaya
 It is said that from that day Hanuman ji started to be sindoor on his body in remembrance of this sublime swami-devotion
 hanuman chalisa main bhi varnit he- ram rasayan tumhare pasa, sadaa raho raghupati ke dasa 
 
 is baat se siddh hota he ki hanuman ji jeevandaayini booti ke samaan hai, jinaki upasna se shaareerik rup se nirbal bhakt main bhi urja kaa sanchaar hota he or vah swasth rahata he
 While offering vermilion, chanting this mantra is going to offer vermilion to Hanuman's idol, then first bathe his idol with water
 iske baad sabhi puja saamagree arpan karen
 After this, while chanting the mantra, add vermilion in jasmine oil or apply a small amount of desi ghee directly on the idol and put vermilion on it

 However, the complainant Rahul Sharma, convenor of NGO Road anti-corruption Organization, has accused Chief Minister Kejriwal of cooperating in sanctioning Bansal's alleged fake bills of Rs 10 crore
 (is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he

 Three reports were filed against Bansal and PWD officials after it was found that several bills for different purposes were approved by different companies

 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne 2 aktubar ko mahatma gandhi ko unki jayanti par yaad kiya or ek rashtravyapee safai abhiyaan kaa shubharambh kiya
 Five days later, addressing a rally in Hisar before the assembly elections in Haryana, he recalled Jawaharlal Nehru and asked the schools to organize a special campaign for children between November 14 and 19
 14 november nehru kii jayanti hoti he to 19 november indira gandhi kii
 But after that instead of celebrating Indira Gandhi's death anniversary on 31 October, she decided to celebrate the 139th birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel
 congress ke netaaon ne har maukey par isaki kadi aalochana karte hue aarope lagaaya ki modi or bijepi unke pratik purushon ko hathiyaa rahe hai

 These three icons, such as Gandhi, Nehru and Patel, are not the only big icons that the BJP has kept an eye on

 He has a long list of such personalities

 iske ulat apane kheme main mahatvavapurn netaaon kii kami vaale bhagava kheme ne un netaaon main se kuch par apana daawa jataane kii koshish kii he
 In fact, even before the Modi government had made a saffron claim on the legacy of Sardar Patel and Madanmohan Malaviya in recent months, the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government had rebuked the Congress for reestablishing the symbols of its choice

 After being appointed the head of bjp's election campaign committee for the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Modi launched a nationwide campaign to collect iron pieces to establish a "statue of Unity" for Sardar Patel in Gujarat
 pradhanmantri ke rup main unhone madanamohan malviya ko bharat ratna diya, jo hindu hiton kii baat karte the or kai baar congress adhyaksh rah chuke the
 In fact, the Congress's preference for the nehru-gandhi family over that of all the freedom fighters and prominent Indians in other walks of life has given the BJP an opportunity to build its own class of Indian Shalakapurushas
 or chunki nehru-gandhi parivaar kii viraasat ko mitaayaa nahin ja saktaa tha, lihaaja unke rajnatik mahimamandan ko kamjor karne kaa sabase acha tarika nae sire se anya logon kii chhavi ko pesh karne kaa tha
 In fact, Modi gave broad indications to this effect the day after he took over as Prime Minister, when he did not go to Nehru's tomb on his death anniversary on 27 May
 pratham pradhanmantri ko yaad karne ke liye unhone sirf ek twitor sandesh de diya tha
 Although those were the initial days of the government, the government, which has now made a comprehensive list, has prepared a detailed plan to present these "national emblem men" in public memory, which will be unlike the Congress emblem men
 is vistrut yojana main maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantralay kaa yah faisla shaamil he ki vishvavidhyalayon ko unke naam par peeth sthapit karne ko kaha jaae, unki smriti main buniyadi dhaanche kaa nirmaan kiya jaae, or in hastiyon kii yaad main kaaryakramon kaa aayojan kiya jaae
 The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) conducted a series of essays on freedom fighter and tricolor designer Pingali Venkaiah in August 2014
 usee tarah se shikshan satr ke sardiyon ke vyast maheenon ko dekhte hue, yah samaran utsav july or sitambar ke bich bade paimaane par manaaya jayega
 The meeting on 22 October was chaired by the Secretary of Higher Education and was attended by the top officials of UGC and Vice Chancellors of Delhi University and Jawaharlal Nehru University among others

 The institutions in which these emblematic men worked or studied would also be asked to celebrate their famous alumnus
 isaki pehali jhalak 25 disambar ko dekhi gai
 In the Kashi Hindu University, which was founded by Malviya, it was announced that an UGC inter-university Center would be built in the name of Malviya

 Although benches are also expected to be set up in the name of Nehru and Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan, more information is being gathered on personalities such as Lala Hardayal and freedom fighters of the Northeast before the plans are finalized
 vastav main purvottar vah kshetra he, jahaan bhagava khemaa bade paimaane par prasar kii koshish kar rahaa he, or suchi is disha main ek spasht sanket detii he

 If a Statue of Unity will be created to honor Patel as part of the bjp's ambition to cut off his identity as a Congress leader, the government will have another on Mahatma Gandhi on Gandhi's death anniversary on 30 January Will issue postage stamps which will focus on Modi's Swachh Bharat Abhiyan

 Along with full-time terrorism, Hafiz Saeed, who turned out to be a part-time leader, has exactly the same fate
 265 dehshatgardon ko usne pakistan ke chunavi maidan main utaara tha
 Son, son-in-law were all contesting elections
 magar hafiz said kii puri team khaataa tak nahin khol pai
 The entire team was out on zero
 yani kul mila kar aatanki hafiz said apane ghar main hi buree tarah pit gaya
 The Pakistani people do not want Hafiz Saeed to even deny Hafiz
 pakistan ko hafiz kaa betaa bhi nahin chahie
 Pakistan does not even want Hafiz's son-in-law
 pakistan ko hafiz ke gurgey bhi nahin chahie
 Terrorists like Hafiz Saeed may try to poison the Pakistanis
 lekin us mulk kii awam ne jo nateeja diya he usase saafe zaahir he ki puure desh kii rahabari kaa daawa karne vaale is aatanki kaa vahaan kii avam ne dabba gol kar diya he
 Hafiz Saeed was dreaming of becoming the Prime Minister of Pakistan by taking out more than 250 terrorists in the election field
 lekin mulk ne moulana ko saaf kah diya ki pakistani politics main hafiz said jaison ke liye koi jagah nahin he
 Terrorist Hafiz Saeed's mission became a political conspiracy for Felhafiz
 pakistan ke chunaavon main hafiz kii zamaanat zabt ho gai
 On the very first ball, the captain bowled Hafiz cleanly
 pakistan kii awam ne aatanki jamaat ko 'khuda hafiz' kah diya
 And in this way Hafiz Saeed's flop show! Hari Hafeez's party in Pakistan's Pakistan gave Imran a chance to form government
 vahiin nawaz or benazir kii party ko sammanjanak siten
 Even small parties won seats
 kaaphi taadaad main nirdalai ummidavaar bhi jite
 But if he did not win, only Hafiz Saeed, his family and his terrorists
 250 se zyaada siton se uske aatanki chunaav lard rahe the
 But winning the seat is a distant thing zyaadaatar jagahon par uske aatanki ummidavaaron kii zamaanat hi zabt ho gai he
 Hafiz Saeed got beaten up at home by Pakistani people
 haafiz said kaa flop sho!sargoda se hafiz said kaa betaa hafiz talha said haar gaya to lahore se uske damaad hafiz kalid valid ko bhi buree tarah se haar kaa munh dekhnaa padaa
 Similarly, Qari Mohammad Sheikh Yakub, a disciple of Hafiz, also lost badly from the second seat of Lahore
 cricket kii zabaan main kahen to imran khan or puure pakistan ne hafiz said ko itnaa dhoyaa kii bakhiya udhed di
 The situation was such that none of the candidates of Hafiz Saeed, the mastermind of Mumbai attack, could be seen in the election battle
 265 siton par utaare the ummidavaarapako bataa den ki india ke most wonted aatanki hafiz said ne pakistan kii 265 siton par ummidavaar utaare the
 Her Allahu Akbar Party did not lose so badly even when she used to fight alone
 magar hafiz or uske karindon ne to is party kii bhi lutiyaa dubo di
 It is clear from the results that the people of Pakistan should no longer panic in the name of Kashmir
 tut gaya aatanki kaa sapnaamatdaan se pehle hi ye tay ho gaya tha ki janata apane haq ke sawaal kar rahi he
 He needs basic things like jobs, law and order and education
 haalanki pakistan kii sabhi siyaasi partiyon ke bich aapasi rassakashi ko dekhte hue hafiz said ko laga ki is baar pakistani avam sidhe nahin to pichley daravaaje se hi use pradhanmantri ke daftar or phir kursi tak jarur le jaaegi
 But the boss of terror broke his dream
 hafiz said ke chehre par haar ke nishanjo hafiz said kal tak dahade maar-markar chunavi reliyon kar rahaa tha
 Today that Hafiz Saeed's tongue has dried up
 chehre par murdaani chai he
 The throat is sore and Jouban is faltering
 or ho bhi kyon naa
 The entire team of Hafiz Saeed, who went on to become the leader, has been out of politics in his first election innings, getting out on zero
 pakistan kii janata ne aatanki ko nakaar diya he

 Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia has written a letter to CAG Shashikant Sharma
 usamen sidhe-sidhe sieji ke audit ko lekar sawaal khadey kiye gaye hai
 It is accused of discriminating against the Delhi government
 ye bhi kaha gaya he ki audit,siyaasi agenda se prabhavit he
 The audit of the CAG termed the interference in the functioning of the government and even said that interfering with one constitutional body in the functioning of another constitutional body will not give good results
 1
 Letter 2 of 8 pages
 9 binduon kii chitthee main sarkaar ke vigyaapan par sieji kii audit par sawaal uthaae gaye hai
 3
 sawaal main ek ye bhi poocha he ki sirf dilli sarkaar ke vigyaapan kharch kaa byora maangane kaa kya aadhaar he, kyon duusare rajyon or centre sarkaar ko aise audit se alag rakhaa gaya he
 4
 audit kaa ye niyam hota he ki jo sawaal puche jate hai unhen subjective nahin hona chahie, lekin jo sawaal puche gaye unamem subjekitivity dikhti he isliye ye avivevakapurna or gaiyr tark sangat dikhataa he
 5
 sieji jaisi sanvaidhanik sansthaaon ko khud ko siyaasi agendon se prabhavit nahin hona chahie or saath hi siyaasi shorgul par dhyaan nahin dena chahie
 6
 audit vittiya gadabadiyon or policy sambandhit ulalanghanon kii jaanch ke liye hota he, lekin sieji ne is maamle main kathith gadabadiyon par aapatti darj karaayaa he
 7
 jin gadabadiyon kaa zikr sieji ne guideline ulanghan ke maamalon main kiya he, wo sieji ke daayre main aati hi nahin hai
 8
 apni chitthee main sisodiya ne centre sarkaar ke un vigyapanon kaa bhi zikr kiya he jisamen pradhanmantri kii tasviir or naam kaa zikr hota he, saath hi telugana sarkaar ke vigyapanon kaa bhi zikr he jo baaki rajyon main bhi chape hai
 9
 iske alaava sieji audit main uthaae gaye kai or bindu bhi sawaalon ke ghere main hai or ek adhikrut sarkaar ke kaamkaaj main dakhsandaji he
 The cag's job is only to conduct an audit, commenting on one's work does not come under its jurisdiction
 10
 Both the elected government and the CAG are constitutional bodies, so if the institutions work within the scope of each other, then the results will not be good

 He said that either due to the negligence of the Center, the onion stock has deteriorated, the prices have increased drastically or there is a bad intention to benefit the hoarders
 sisodiya ne kaha ki pyaaj kii badhati keemton se log pareshaan hai
 He said, "this is the case of the whole country, but the central government in Delhi is deliberately producing shortages (of onions)
" dilli sarkaar kii ore se baar-baar maang kiye jane ke baavjood pyaaj centre ne pyaaj dena roak diya he
 "the central government had written a letter to the Delhi government on September 5 that it had 56,000 tonnes of onions and could take onions as per its requirement
 sisodiya ne kaha, "sheeghra hi dilli sarkaar ne suchit kiya ki vah 10 trek pyaaj (2
 5 lakh kg) will be sold daily at a cheaper price so that hoarding will be curbed

 unhone kaha, "hamane team banaai he or prayek vidhansabha seat par sasti dar par pyaaj kaa bikri centre kholaa he
 Where is the stock of onion claimed by the Central Government in the letter? Why did he let a large stock of onions rot? "he said that after November 24, not even a truck was provided with onions
 aap netaa ne kaha, "jaisaa daawa kiya ki pyaaj kaa baari stock he uske baavjood pyaaj nahin dena is baat kaa sanket detaa he ki centre sarkaar shaayad jamaakhoron ko laabh pahunchane ke liye abhaav paidaa kar rahi he
 "hussain said that the Delhi government has prepared basic facilities by installing mobile vans, fair price shops and people as needed
 unhone kaha, "main kendriya mantri ram vilaas paswan se aagrah karata hum ki vah pyaaj muhaiyaa karavaaen taaki rashtriya rajdhani main saste daam par ise bechaa ja sake

 netaa ne 'periods' ke dauraan kaamkaaji mahilaon ko 2 din kii chuttee vetan ke saath dilaae jane kii maang parliament se kii he

 She said that periods significantly increase the fatigue of women
 saath hi isse mahilaon kii kaam karne kii kshamta or yaaddasht main giravat aati he
 On the other hand, human rights activists have rejected the fact that such special facilities are being given to women
 rus main lambey samay se maanavadhikaar ke liye kaam rahe group se jude anna sobako ne kaha ki mahilaon ke liye is tarah kii maang aspasht or puri tarah se tarkahin he
 However, how much special facilities Dagataryov can get women, it will tell only in the coming time

 Ravi Shastri expressed his outrage at Sourav Ganguly, saying that Ganguly disrespected his position as a member of the advisory committee and the candidates he was interviewing
 team india ke purv captain ganguli par nishaanaa sadhate hue shastri ne kaha unhen (ganguli ko) kisi chiz kii parvaah nahin
 While advising Sourav Ganguly, he said that he should not do so further
 kam se kam unhen jis kaam kii zimmedaari di gai he, use puraa karen
 
 team india ke coach pad ke liye intervyuu dene ke baavjood nahin chune gaye shastri ne kaha, 'main khafaa nahin hum, naaraaz nahin hum
 Just disappointed and that is because they (ganguly) have disrespected the person they were interviewing or should have taken
 unhone apni zimmedaari ke prati apane pad ke prati anadar dikhaaya jo unhen saunpi gai thi
 When Shastri was asked about Ganguly, he said, "all i will say is that next time he should be present in such interviews
" khaskar jab jimmedaari itani badi he
 Despite all this, Shastri praised Anil Kumble and said that he is a very good cricketer and he has a ready team that he can take to new heights
 vahiin saurav ganguli ne ravi shastri dwaara uthaae ja rahe kisi bhi sawaal par jawaab dene se pehle hi manaa kar diya he
 Ganguly, the former captain of Team India and a member of the advisory committee, had a clear answer to this, 'let Ravi Shastri have to say
 mujhe us par kuch nahin kahana he
 Ganguly said that the coach selection process is confidential and i would not like to say anything on this! khabaren ain ki saurav ganguli ko us din anya kaaryakramon kaa hissaa hona tha, jisaki jaankaree pehle se hi salaahkaar samiti ko de di gai thi
 Interviews for the coach position began on 21 June at 1
30 pm and Ganguly was not present twice a day from 1 to 2 pm and again from 5 to 6:30 pm
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki ganguli ko shaam ko bengal kaaryakari samiti kii baithak main hissaa lenaa tha or ravi shastri kaa intervyuu shaam main hi kareeb 5 baje shuru hua tha
 The comments donon ke bich aakhir kyon takaraav he, is par alag-alag tarah kii baaten saamne ai hai
 Some consider this to be the reason for the confrontation between the two coaches
 shastri or ganguli ke bich isse pehle coach banane kii res main jang hui thi, jisamen shastri ne baaji maar lee thi
 Some sources also say that Ganguly believes that Shastri does not fully respect his contribution to Indian cricket
 unhone (ganguli ne) jo team khadi kii or bharat ko top tak lekar gaye, shastri ne kabhi uskaa sammaan nahin kiya
 It is said that Ganguly is also angry with this
 vahiin kuch pakshon kaa maananaa he ki ye bas ravi shastri ke bisisiai ke purv adhyaksh en
 Srinivasan is close to being close, but all these things are speculation
 
 What is true, only these two players know, or the truth is limited to what is visible
