 congress2014 ke chunavi mishan memrahul gandhike hi netritv main utregi
 It has been revealed from the secret election draft of Congress
 congress ne agenda 2014 ke naam chunavi masauda taiyaar kar liya he or iske 30 pannon main se 3 panne main sirf rahul gandhi ke hi netritv kaa zikr he
 The draft states - In 2014, the party will get Rahul's leadership, although it has not been clarified that Rahul will be the prime ministerial candidate
 yani rahul kii piem ummidavaari par congress kaa chunavi masauda puri tarah khamosh he
 It is hoped in the draft that Rahul's leadership will go a long way in connecting the youth, the party will field with full force
 congress ke angeda 2014 main ek baat or khaas he ki is par obama ke chunaav prachaar kaa kaaphi asar dikh rahaa he
 It emphasizes the use of social media like Obama's election campaign
 congress ko rahul se hi he ummidarahul gandhi bhale hi pradhanmantri pad ko lekar sawaal ko gairajaruri bataate hon, lekin congress main is baat ko lekar ab do raay nahin ki 2014 kaa loksabhaa chunaav rahul gandhi kii hi aguwai main ladaa jayega
 Rahul may be put to the forefront of questions about the skill of handling inherited politics, but the Congress has hope from Rahul's charisma for votes
 sanghathan main bhale hi unki haisiyat sonia gandhi ke baad duusare number ke netaa kii ho, lekin congress kii chunavi ladaai sirf or sirf rahul ke ird gird ladi jaaegi
 The Strategy Committee of the Congress has prepared its 30-page draft for Mission 2014, which details the role of Rahul from his election strategy
 rahul ke liye hogi imtihaan kii ghadinau saal se rahul gandhi siyasat main hai
 On the head is the legacy of the Gandhi Nehru dynasty, despite which his charismatic image continues to be questioned
 jis uttarapradesh ko rahul ne apni raajnneetik prayogshaala banaai, usee uttar pradesh ne vidhansabha chunaav main congress ko aisa jhatka diya ki party ke liye khud ke dam par sarkaar banane kaa sapana chakanachur ho gaya
 After the shock of Uttar Pradesh, Rahul began to strengthen the party's organization across the country, whose time of the biggest test now came closer
 diarect cash sabsidi banegi chunavi muddahal main rahul gandhi ne vikaas kaa nayaa khaakaa desh ke saamne rakhaa
 Talked about strengthening the common man instead of the government for the development of the country
 nau saalon se sarkaar chalaane vaali party ke aalaa netaaon main se ek hone ke baavjood system kii kamiyon kii khul kar aalochana kii
 Emphasized the change in political culture but the culture of wooing the voters did not change
 stritji cameti ke draft main ye saaf kar diya gaya ki congress chunaav main diarect cash sabsidi ko hi apana chunavi mudda banaaegi
 The Congress has devised its election strategy, the most important is not to plan Rahul Gandhi as a candidate for the post of PM, the plan to project the party leader, the goal of becoming the largest party and to form a strategy for alliances with regional parties
 haalanki madhyavadhi chunaav kaa raag alaap rahi bijepi ne congress kii chunavi taiyaariyon ko siyaasi stant qaraar diya
 The Congress started the exercise to increase the clan of the UPA

 mamata banerjee ko phir se apane paale main laane ke liye sarkaar ne pashchim bengal ke liye is saal fund 22 hajaar karod se 30 hajaar karod rupye karne kaa faisla kiya
 The biggest problem of Congress is in Uttar Pradesh
 sutron kii maane to congress upi main samaajawaadee party or bispi ko chhod kar zyaadaatar chote dalon ko apane jhande tale laane kii koshish main he, to bihar main ek baar phir lalu-paswan ke saath chunavi samjhauta ho saktaa he
 Apart from this, in Tamil Nadu, the Congress is trying to clear the misunderstandings and contest again with DMK
 kya 2013 main hi loksabhaa chunaav ho jaaenge?ab sawaal ye he ki aakhir chaudaa maheene pehle hi congress chunavi taiyaariyon main kyon jute gai? kya in taiyaariyon main jald chunaav kii aahat he? kya 2013 main hi loksabhaa chunaav ho jaaenge? jis tarah se 2014 main congress kii jeet kaa trump card kahi jane vaali teen yojanaon diarect cash sabsidi, garibon ko roti kii guarantee dene vaale khaadya suraksha or kisaanon ko phayda pahunchane vaale bhoomi sudhaar kanoon ko lagu karaane kii hadabadi he, usase saaf he ki chunaavon kii tarikho ko lekar sarkaar koi jokhim nahin lenaa chaahati
 Will the charisma show Rahul's leadership? Has Rahul Gandhi become a firm player of politics, with the help of which the Congress-led UPA will be able to score a hat-trick of victory? The easier the question, the more complex the answer
 rahul gandhi nehru khandaan ke aise vaaris hai, jinhen gathbandhan ke daur main sabase mushkil chunavi imtihaan se guzarana hoga
 a strategy has to be devised to reduce voters' displeasure over the Congress which has been in power for ten years
 jis mahangaai ne aam logon kaa niwala chin liya, unheen votaron ke sahare chunavi baitarani paar kerani hogi
 To hold power, one has to undergo a litmus test before and after elections for parliamentary arithmetic
 puraane sahyogiyon ko saath lekar chalane kii jimmedaari hogi, to nae saathiyon kii talash main haath badhanaa hoga

 Manish Hindavi, Associate Professor in the Department of Political Science, Lucknow University, says, "mulayam Singh Yadav did not directly support Shivpal, due to which Shivpal Yadav had reached the family in oblivion
 siyaasi astitv bachaae rakhane kii majaburi ne unhen alag raah pakadaaey ko majaboor kiya
 Mulayam Singh has once again become active in persuading Shivpal
 unhone 4 sitambar ko shivpal ko lakhanu main apane awaas par bulaakar baithak kii par shivpal ne samjhaute ke liye apane bade bhai kaa har prastaav thukraa diya
 SP MLA from Jaswantnagar Shivpal Yadav is also worried about his assembly membership, hence he has formed a Morcha by not forming a party other than SP
 gathbandhan main bikharadgale loksabhaa chunaav main sapa or bahujan samaaj party (basapa) ke bich sambhavit gathbandhan ke bich secular morcha ke gathan kii ghoshnaa ne pradesh kaa siyaasi taapmaana badha diya he
 Even if the youth are connected with the Akhilesh-led SP, Shivpal has a good hold on many senior leaders with the support base
 siyaasi vishleshak anumaan laga rahe hai ki loksabhaa chunaav se shivpal kaa alag morcha bananaa bhaajapa-virdohi vipakshi ekta ko kamjor karegaa
 Govind Vallabh Pant Director of Institute of Social Sciences, Dr
 badri narayan bataate hai, ''upi ke har jile main shivpal yadav ke samarthak hai
 Holding the separate path of Shivpal may lead to confusion in the sp's original vote bank which is not conducive to the possible alliance of the SP-BSP
 bhaajapa bhi yahi chaahati he
 Although there is no sympathy in favor of Akhilesh Yadav, for this Shivpal has also cleverly said to join the SP-BSP alliance (see conversation)
 secular morcha ke gathan se agar bhaajapa kii baanche khiliin hai to akhilesh yadav ke kareebi sapa netaa bhi raahat mahasoos kar rahe hai
 "the former BSP President Mayawati had made a very indecisive statement about BSP President Mayawati," says an SP state secretary
 shivpal ko lekar basapa netaaon main hichak he
 If they find a way out of their SP, it will be easy to negotiate a possible alliance between the SP-BSP
 '' shivpal ke liye chote dalon ko secular morcha se jodpha aasaan nahin hoga
 Just a day before the formation of Secular Front, Shivpal met Om Prakash Rajbhar, a BJP alliance partner and cabinet minister in the Yogi government
 secular morcha ke gathan ke baad rajbhar ne isse duuri bana rakhi he
 Rajbhar says, "I have had many meetings with Shivpal in the last months but he has nothing to do with politics
 ''yuvaaon ne sanbhali kamanmorcha ke paksh main maahaul banane ke liye shivpal yadav ne yuvaaon ko aage kar diya he
 His son Aditya Yadav is busy in getting young leaders included in the Morcha under the banner of "shivpal Yadav Fans Association"
 shivpal yadav phens association ke pradesh adhyaksh ashish choube bataate hai, ''upi ke 60 jilo main association kii 51 sadasyeey kaaryakarini kaa gathan ho chukaa he
 Our organization will work to connect neglected leaders to the secular front
 iske liye sanghathan ko purvi, madhya or pashchimi jone main baanta gaya he
 Former district president Sunil Yadav is working to bring neglected SP leaders on one platform by forming an organization called 'mulayam's people' in Etawah
 'international socialist council' ke nirvaachit sachiv or africa kaa pratishthit 'mandela sammaan' paane vaale samaajawaadee netaa deepak mishra purv main sapa prabudgh prakoshth ke adhyaksh rah chuke hai
 Mishra, close to Shivpal, has the responsibility of connecting the leaders of socialist ideology across the country with the secular front
 sabase zyada siyaasi halchal yadav belt kahe jane vaale mainpuri, itawa, firozabad, sanbhal jaise jilon main he
 For example, former MLA Raghuraj Singh Shakya, who was a Member of Parliament from Sadar Assembly in Mulayam Singh's home district Etawah, former MLA Sukhdevi Verma, former District President Sunil Yadav, Jaswantnagar Municipality Chairman Sunil Kumar Jolly, along with many popular leaders are considered to be staunch supporters of Shivpal
 Huh
 in netaaon ne bhale hi sapa na chodi ho par shivpal ke morche ke samarthan main aakar ye party ko kamjor karne kaa aparoksh prayaas jarur karenge
 But the biggest challenge before Shivpal is to create his own political status
 secular morcha ke gathan se agar bhaajapa kii baanchhein khili hai to akhilesh yadav ke kareebi sapa netaa bhi raahat mahasoos kar rahe hai
 Talk to Shivpal Singh Yadav: 'the secular front is not avoided by the alliance of the SP-BSP' Shivpal Yadav, who arrived in Lucknow for the first time after the formation of the Samajwadi Secular Front, spoke to Ashish Mishra at his residence on Vikramaditya Marg, Lucknow on 4 September
 mukhya anshasecular morcha banane kii jarurat kyon padi?sabhi partiyon main aise netaa hai jo upekshit hai
 Gandhians, Lohiaites, like-minded people like Chaudhary Charan Singh Wadi

 With this decision your quarrel will increase in the Yadav family? There is no quarrel in the family
 main vidhayak hum hi, mujhe to mukhyamantri bananaa nahin he
 i have held almost all positions in SP
 mujhe to sirf kaam chahie
 Is there any scope of reconciliation with Akhilesh Yadav? When talking about reconciliation, so much time has passed
 akhilesh to apane pita kii baat nahin maanate hai
 No party can run alone
 par mulaayam singh yadav to bete akhilesh yadav ke saath hai?maine secular morche kaa gathan netaji (mulaayam singh yadav) se puch kar hi kiya he
 They have their consent and they will also stay with me
 secular morcha loksabhaa chunaav main sapa-basapa ke sambhavit gathbandhan ke liye 'vot katwa' banegaa?isse saaf he ki hamaari bhi koi haisiyat he
 We have mass base
 agar morcha kii haisiyat he to hamen bhi gathbandhan main shaamil karo
 That is, you are not avoiding the alliance of opposition parties formed with the SP-BSP? We are not avoiding the alliance
 morcha bhi isiilie banaaya gaya he
 According to our status, seats will have to be given in Lok Sabha elections
 main gathbandhan kaa hissaa banane ke liye taiyaar hum
 If this does not happen, the Morcha will contest all 80 seats

 maine jis sangharsh kaa elaan kiya he use bhatakaane ke liye aisi baaten kii ja rahi hai
 Who is your struggle against? No one is asking those who have the support base
 chapalusee or chugalkhori karne waalon ko tavajjo di ja rahi he
 i am opposing this new practice in politics
 raashtrapati chunaav main to aapane bhaajapa ko samarthan diya tha?maine danke kii chot par bhaajapa ummidavaar ko vot diya tha
 You will not ask for votes from me, you will not call me in any meeting, if you ignore me then how will i support you

 Are you feeling isolated in new political and family situations? i have a mass base

 There are lakhs of supporters in every district who want to join our front

 com / pds8zjxvlg — Amarjeet Singh (@amarjeetukpcc) January 18, 2017 Congress leaders are fiercely targeting Yashpal, calling him unfaithful because of Yashpal's sudden reversal
 congress pravaktaa mathura dutt joshi kaa kahana he ki ye puraa rajya jaanata he ki yashpal arya ne bevafaayee kii he, aise main unki bevafaayee ke charche hona vaazib he
 Yashpalaya Shapal Arya had joined BJP and recently joined Congress and joined BJP
 wo ek hafte pehle tak rajya kii congress sarkaar main cabinet mantri the
 Yashpal Arya has also been sitting on the post of state president of the Congress at one time
 bijepi ne yashpal arya ko bajpur or unke bete sanjeev arya ko nainital seat se tikat diya he
 Yashpal Arya was seeking the responsibility of distributing tickets to all 9 seats in Udham Singh Nagar along with seeking tickets for his son while in Congress, which the Congress did not approve
 iske baad yashpal arya paala badal kar bijepi ke kheme main chale gaye
 There are more 'bewafas'
 
 
 yashpal arya pehle netaa nahin hai jinhone congress se kinaaraa kar bijepi kaa daaman thama he
 During the rebellion in the Congress on March 18 last year, 10 rebel mlas were asked to leave the party about 10 hours ago
 lekin yashpal ne achaanak faisla lekar party ko sanbhalane kaa mauka tak nahin diya
 The process of leaving one party in Devbhoomi to another party is still going on
 ab dekhnaa hoga ki congress jab apni list jari karegi to usamen duusari partiyon se aae kin baagiyon ko tikat detii he
 If this happens, then 'bewafa' is sure to be associated with the names of those rebels

 The management of a degree college in Aligarh took such a step, in which the students are very angry, in the extreme enthusiasm to stop cheating
 purush toilet main sisitivi camere lagaae jane par principal kaa kahana he ki agar koi toilet main kapadon main chhupaakar laai gai chit se nakal karne kii koshish karegaa to pakadaa jayega
 This incident is of Dharma Samaj Degree College, Aligarh

 The principal then issued orders to install CCTV cameras in the men's three toilets
 principal dow hem prakaash se jab is bare main baat kii gai to unhone kaha, ‘nakal rokane ke uddeshy se ye camere lagaae gaye hai
 As soon as the student gets out the slip in the toilet, our team will catch it
 isamen virodh kii to koi baat hi nahin he
 'this decision of the college administration has strongly objected to Saurabh Chaudhary, student leader and coordinator of Dharm Jagran Coordination
 choudhary ne ye bhi kaha ki agar college ne toilet se camere nahin hataae to kanoonee karrwai kaa sahaara liya jayega
 Manvendra Pratap Singh, member of the National Minority Education Monitoring Committee, has also described this as a step taken in the principal's zeal

 There has been a ruckus in the 1984 anti-sikh riot case after the acquittal of Congress leader Sajjan Kumar
 court ke faisle ke khilaaf sikh puri dilli main virodh-pradarshan kar rahe hai
 The Sikhs protested vigorously, stopping the metro in Subhash Nagar area of the capital Delhi

 At the moment, service has been restored, but Subhash Nagar and Tilak Nagar stations are closed

 Tilak Nagar has been jammed and Sikhs are shouting slogans
 sikhon kaa kahana he ki sajjan kumaar ke khilaaf saboot hone par bhi unako bari kiya gaya
 The Sikhs got angry as soon as Sajjan Kumar was acquitted on Tuesday
 court parisar main hi danga peediton ne jamkar virodh-pradarshan kiya tha
 At the same time, the Congress-backed Sarna faction is also on the defensive after the acquittal of Congress leader Sajjan Kumar in the '84 riots

 He says that this will be able to know where there was a shortage in this matter
 Was the case not fought properly or was there any deficiency in the judicial process? The former head of Delhi Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee says that the court has left Sajjan Kumar in the absence of evidence
 unke mutabik yah jaanch kaa vishay he ki kin kaarnon se sajjan ko sajaa nahin hui
 Sarna said that he will take the matter to the High Court because the sentiments of the Sikhs have been affected by this decision

 The BJP government is going to be formed once again in Gujarat
 rahul gandhi ke saath hardik patel, jignesh mewaani or alpesh thakur kii tikdi kii athak mehnat ke baad bhi bijepi rajya main lagaataar chhathi baar satta main aa rahi he
 The question arises that after 22 years of anti-incumbency and gst-demonetization, why did the Congress not win the trust of Gujarat even after the alleged displeasure of the traders? Why did he get defeated in the state? In response to these questions, 10 reasons emerge
 1
 Gujarati asmitapm Modi has become a symbol of Gujarati identity
 rajya ke log is baat par garv karte rahe hai ki unke bich kaa ek gujarati desh kaa pradhanmantri he
 So when PM Modi made a passionate appeal to the Gujaratis to win his son, the people of the state were bound to be affected by it
 chunaav prachaar ke antim daur main kii gai modi kii apil se gujarati asmita ko lekar sanvadensheel gujaratiyon ne bijepi kaa saath dena uchit samajha
 2
 hindi banaam gujaratirahul gandhi ne mehnat to bahut kii, lekin ve bahari hone or hindi bhashi hone kii vajah se gujaratiyon se us tarah se conect nahin ho paae, jaise ki piem modi
 Modi gave all his speeches in Gujarati so that naturally he could reach more and more Gujaratis
 duusari taraf, rahul gandhi hindi main bhaashan de rahe the, jisaki vajah se unke bhaashanon kaa modi ke tulana main zyada asar nahin rahaa
 3
 congress kaa jati card failrajya main congress ne patidaar andolan kaa samarthan kar jati card khilne kii puri koshish kii
 It seemed that till now Gujarat which was known for development and religious division, now there will be politics of ethnic polarization
 lekin nateezon se aisa lagata he ki congress kii yah ranneeti kargar nahin ho pai
 Especially Alpesh Thakur and Jignesh Mevani somehow managed to win their seats but they failed to do any major caste polarization in support of Congress
 4
 During the election campaign by Mani Shankar Iyer and Kapil Sibal Mani Shankar Aiyar, calling PM Modi 'low' and Kapil Sibal's plea to defer the case further in defense of the Ram temple case also came to the fore
 piem modi ne ayyar ke is bayaan ko lapak liya or gujarat ke chunaav abhiyaan main is masale ko jamkar uthaaya or ise apnigaribi or jati sejod diya
 The people of the state do not tolerate the insult of Modi, it was clear only in 2007 with the statement of Sonia Gandhi's death merchant
 10 saal baad phir vahi kahani doharaai gai
 5
 siem netaa kaa abhaavcongress koi damdaar siem cheharaa nahin pesh kar pai
 State veteran Shankar Singh Vaghela is out of the party
 congress main shakti singh gohil, arjan modhwadiya jaise netaa the, lekin wo khud hi chunaav nahin jeet paa rahe
 Bharat Singh Solanki did not even contest the election
 jaahir he vijay roopaani ke saamne congress kii ore se koi nahin tha
 In such a situation, it was directly Modi vs Rahul in which Rahul could not stand anywhere
 6
 Trust in Rahul Gandhi Even though there was some resentment among the people of the lower state, he was less able to trust Rahul Gandhi than PM Modi
 rahul gandhi ko ab tak anicchhuk raajnneetijna mana jaataa rahaa he or unke netritv main congress party ko kai rajyon main haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa he
 In these elections Rahul improved his image but he could not become more reliable than Modi, so people chose BJP instead of Congress
 7
 In comparison to the religious polarization and ethnic polarization of the nationalism Congress, the BJP tried its old pattern of religious polarization this time too
 gujarat main koi bhi chunaav ho yahaan masalaa hindu-musalmaan kaa ho jaataa he
 While Kapil Sibal's attempt to postpone the Ram temple lawsuit encouraged Hindu solidarity, Narendra Modi started cunningly propagating that Pakistan too wants to defeat the BJP in Gujarat after the revelations of a meeting at Mani Shankar Aiyar's house
 yahi nahin, jammu-kashmir ke netaa salmaan nijaami ke tamaam puraane twit ko prachaarit kar bijepi ne yah sabit karne kii koshish kii ki congress ke netaa desh virdohi tatwon kaa samarthan karte hai
 This led to a feeling of patriotism and nationalism and the voters could not join the Congress
 8
 After the initial campaign, the campaign of the backward Congress Congress was initially very strong, but later when PM Modi intensified his campaign, Rahul Gandhi fell behind in this race
 loksabhaa chunaav ke baad pehali baar hua he ki bijepi ne kisi rajya ke liye itani mehnat kii he
 Modi tried to touch all 182 seats in Gujarat and held 34 rallies
 congress ke 'vikaas pagal he' abhiyaan ko bhi shaayad isliye zyada sweekaaryata nahin mil pai, kyonki gujaratiyon kaa to vikaas par bharosa he hi
 9
 jiesti-notebandi kaa asar nahinaisa lagata he ki gujarat kaa vyapaaree jiesti evam notebandi se pareshaan or naaraaz jarur tha, lekin jab vot dene kii baat ai to vah bijepi ko chhod nahin paaya
 The merchant community has traditionally been a BJP voter
 surat main tamaam vyapaaree media se baatcheet main aise sanket bhi de rahe the ki ve jiesti or notebandi par bhale modi sarkaar se naaraaz hon, lekin vot ke din unka man badal saktaa he or shaayad hi ve congress ko vot de paaen
 10
 congress kaa soft hindutvachunaav ke maukey par rahul gandhi kaa mandir-mandir ghoomana or party dwaara unhen 'janeudhari brahman' bataanaa janata ko raas nahin aayaa
 It is believed that this time the Congress tried to play soft Hindutva card and that is why it did not even discuss its core voter Muslims
 lekin in sabko congress kii chalbaaji hi samajha gaya or janata isko man se sweekaar nahin kar pai

 tippaniyan Meanwhile, there is also a discussion in the political corridor of Bihar that JDU and CM Nitish Kumar are constantly pressurizing Tejashwi Yadav to get out of the cabinet
 haalanki argedy pramukh lalu yadav ne tejasvi ke istife se saaf manaa kar diya he
 Amid this political outcry, Bihar BJP President Nityanand Rai had said that if RJD leaves Nitish Kumar, the BJP will not allow the government to fall from outside
 ab bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne nitish kumaar kii tarif kii he
 While efforts are on to save the JDU-RJD and Congress's grand alliance undergoing a delicate turn, Amit Shah's latest statement may raise concerns about Lalu Prasad Yadav
 amit shah dilli main jansangh ke sansthaapak dow
 Shyama Prasad came to inaugurate the book (shyama Prasad Mukherjee - His Vision of Education) written on Mukherjee, where he praised the tenure of Nitish Kumar and the BJP-JDU government
 kaarykram main unhone congress par aarope lagaaya ki isane desh bhar main parivaarwaad, jatvaad or tushtikaran kii raajnneeti kii, jiskaa khamiyaja desh ke logon ko bhugatna padaa
 The states that formed the BJP government ended with familism, casteism and appeasement
 isi bich bihar ke raajnneeti galiyare main ye bhi charchaa he ki jadyu or siem nitish kumaar lagaataar tejasvi yadav par mantrimandal se baahar hone kaa dabaav bana rahe hai
 However, RJD chief Lalu Yadav has flatly refused Tejashwi's resignation
 isi raajnneetik gahamagahami ke bich bihar bijepi ke adhyaksh nityanand raay ne kaha tha ki agar argedy nitish kumaar kaa saath chhodti he to bijepi baahar se samarthan kar sarkaar girane nahin degi
 Now BJP President Amit Shah has praised Nitish Kumar

 Dressed in a safari suit on a winter morning in Beijing in 2011, Narendra Modi (who was then the Chief Minister of Gujarat) drove through the wooden banquet hall of the luxurious luxury hotel Raffles to another hall in the Chinese capital, where about 200 of the Chinese majors Officers were present
 2011 kii us subah jaise hi modi raddles ke bollroom main aae, unki team ke sadasyon ne maderin chini lipi main chape card vahaan maujuud logon main baante
 Narendra was now Nalan — now call it a coincidence or a deliberate attempt — Nalan was a popular poet of the Qing dynasty in the 17th century
 us sammelan main vyavsaayik bhaashan ke liye narendra modi ne kisi naukarshah nahin balki china kii sabase badi urja company tibiie ke upaadhyaksh leng yon ko manch par aamantrit kiya
 Modi kept listening and Leng opened up a unique box of his own business experience in Gujarat
 leng ne chini companiyon ke saamne bharat main aa rahi kathinaaiyon ko bataaya
 He said, “it can be difficult to understand the culture of India, but the Modi government has helped us in tackling every problem
 ” unhone gujarat kii acchhee sadakon or nirbaadh bijli aapurti kii prashansa ke pul baandh die
 He said that potholes and power cuts are the biggest concerns of Chinese companies wanting to work in India
 leng ne apane bhaashan ke ant main bataaya ki unki company kaa iraadaa gujarat main 2,500 karod ru
 ($ 400 million) to invest
 badale main modi ne chini companiyon ko “sushasan, paardarshita or javabdehi” kaa vaada kiya
 He said, "we two countries will make Asia the central platform of the world economy
 ” unka yah bhi kahana tha ki unhone china ko ubharate hue dekha he, vishwa main asia kii vyapak bhoomika ko “arthshaastriyon, vishleshkon or vitt visheshgyon se bahut pehle hi” samaj liya tha
 Business contacts with heads of state, governors and leaders around the world are common for the actors of the world's second largest economy
 2020 tak china kaa bahari nivesh 10-20 kharab dollar tak pahunchane kaa anumaan he, jo kisi bhi duusare desh se zyada hoga
 This has increased the desire for investment from Beijing
 lekin china ke is vikaas ke prati bharat kii pratikriya kuch dhimi he
 There is a general perception among many Chinese companies that in the last decade, India has been skeptical about China's involvement in many sectors of the economy
 centre sarkaar ke aankadon ke hisaab se hi bharat main kul pratyaksh chini nivesh 50 karod dollar ke aasapaas he jabaki china myanmar jaise desh main isaki chaar guna rakam nivesh kar chukaa he, haalanki bharat ko videshi nivesh kii behad jarurat he
 In the last years of the 2000s, the sleepiness of the Indian government was broken and it asked the states to turn to China
 lekin pratinidhimandal ke dauron se kuch hasil nahin hua, zyada-se-zyada bas paryaton sthalon ke daure ke rup main unhen janaa gaya
 In such a situation, the 2011 visit of Narendra Modi became not only memorable but also memorable
 swadesh vaapasi se pehle modi ne mana ki chini mejabaanon se mili pratikriya se ve hatprabh the
 In 2011, Narendra Modi was not seen as an honorable guest in Western countries
 lekin china main great haul of pipal main ve sattarudh communist party of china (sipisi) ke paulitabeuro ke ek sadsy ke saath baithe
 Not every provincial leader who visits there gets this honor
 is samvaadadaata ko modi ne bataaya ki unke liye sabase hairaani kii baat yah thi ki unka swaagat behad garmjoshi se kiya gaya, har baithak tay avadhi se adhik samay tak chali
 The special thing is that Modi was not even from the ruling party at the center then
 ab jab modi desh ke sarvocch pad par asin hai to china kii ummid he ki pradhanmantri narendra modi 2011 ke mukhyamantri modi se bhinn nahin honge
 Modi, who traveled around the country during his visit to China, visited the Special Economic Zone (SEZ) of Guangdong — where China's economic reforms had begun — and also reviewed other big projects in other places
 Was
 pradhanmantri ke kareebi salaahkaaron kaa kahana he ki un dauron ne modi par gaharaa asar choda tha
 National Security Advisor Ajit Doval says, "modi described China's achievements in three words — speed, scale, and skill
 ab modi kaa maananaa he ki bharat ko bhi nishchit rup se isse bharpoor laabh uthaanaa chahie
 "modi Asrato, what does this mean for India's relationship with China?" Or what effect will it have on bilateral relations, which are burdened with strategic concerns — such as border disputes — rather than economic matters? India's trade relations with China have only started in the last decade
 1962 ke baad na to logon kaa, na saamaan kaa avaagaman tha
 Things became normal after the 1988 visit of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi to China
 lekin 2003 main ek anya pradhanmantri, atal bihari vaajapeyi ke china daure ke baad vyapaar sambandh sarapat gati se daude
 When Vajpayee visited China, trade between the two countries was around $ 2-3 billion but in 2011 it reached $ 73 billion, and China was India's largest trade partner
 so, bijepi se modi ke sambandh kii vajah se beijing main yah dharna pusht ho gai he ki rashtravaadi party hone ke baavjood bijepi china se vyapaar sambandh rakhane ke khilaaf nahin he
 As a former Chinese ambassador says, "there is a perception in China that BJP governments are strong, so it is easy to do business with them
" ”china kaa maal, bharat main bikedonon deshon ke bich vyapaar sambandh phalne-phoolne ke do kaarak the—china main kachche maal kii baari maang, kyonki tab vah 2008 ke olympic khelon kii taiyaari main juta tha or buniyadi sanrachana ke liye kachche maal kii use sakht jarurat thi
 Second, India's urgent need for machinery and power equipment
 aaj bharat ke har chaar bijli sanyantron main se ek kisi-na-kisi chini company kaa hota he, to china kii huavi or jedtii jaisi badi telecom companiyon ne bharat kii sanchaar kranti main sahyogi upkaran uplabdh karaae hai
 But there has been very little mutual investment between the two countries which can take economic relations beyond transaction
 adhiktar vyapaar guangdong ke jariye hi hua he, vahi dakshini samrudh praant, jisane 2011 ke daure ke dauraan modi ke dilo-dimag par amit chhap chodi thi
 When India's iron ore trade with China was at the top, about 10 million tons of ash was sent every month via the South China Sea
 vahaan se ise guangjheu ke vishaal bandargah main bheja jaataa, phir ceilink korporation jaisi badi companiyon main bhej diya jaataa
 Sealink's assembly lines outside Guangzhou convey the story of india-china trade relations
 bharat se aae ayask ko yahaan escalators, daravaajon ke handle, cabinet, staircs, railing or duusare saamaan kaa aakaar diya jaataa he
 Sealink's products are sold under the Godrej label across India
 aaj bangaloru, hyderabad or chennai ke nae hawaii addon ke liye adhiktar saamaan kii aapurti ceilink ke jariye hi hoti he
 Each of Guangdong's factories that receive resources from India exports finished goods — from transformers to telecom equipment and cellphones to plastic buckets and furniture — to India
 asantulit samikarnayadi guangdong china kii rashtriya factory he to pados kaa jhesiyang praant china kaa bazaar he
 3 here every year
 6 lakh se adhik bhartiya vyavsaayee yivu aate hai or baari sankhya main saamaan—bijli upkaran se lekar devi-devataaon ke chitra tak-kharidte hai
 One in every four foreign merchants coming to Yiwu is an Indian
 pichley saal, yivu se takreeban 80 karod dollar kaa saamaan bharat bheja gaya
 India's hunger for cheap goods has created a small economy in China, which caters to India's needs
 bhartiya bazaar kii badaulat hi china main jhaao kwingpheng jaise udhyamiyon kaa udai hua he jinhone apni factriyon main bhartiya devi-devataaon ke chitra taiyaar kar unke niryaat se hi tagada vyavsaay khadaa kar liya he
 Yiwu's own entrepreneurs believe that about three dozen companies produce portraits of Indian deities, half of them listed on China's e-bay, Taobao, which send paintings or sculptures directly to Indian businessmen
 jhaao kehete hai, “hamaara vyavsaay bharat ke bazaar par hi tikaa he
 "but this flourishing and symbolic business relationship is now beginning to decline
 varsh 2011 se hi jab pehali baar vyapaar 70 arab dollar ke paar pahunch gaya tha, lagaataar do saal se giravat hi aati rahi
 It dropped to $ 65 billion last year
 chintaa kii baat yah ki vyapaar asantulan badhata hi gaya
 India's exports to China also started falling
 varsh 2013-14 main hone vaale 65
 India's exports were less than $ 15 billion in bilateral trade of $ 8 billion
 is mandi kii vajah he, bharat se louh ayask niryaat main giravat, jo 2009 main 11 karod ton se ghatakar 2013 main sirf 1
 20 million tons
 isaki fori vajah thi, goa or karnataka main khanan par pratibandh
 But this decline is also structural; After spending a decade heavily on infrastructure, China's steel industry is now on the decline due to over-production
 jaisaa yivu ke vyavsaayee shikaayat karte hai ki factory model bhi teji se khatm ho rahaa he
 Gujratmodi's advisers from Guangdong point out that they plan to reform and overhaul the imbalanced and faltering business model between the two countries
 ve china se maal kharidne kii bharat kii nirbharta ko khatm karnaa chaahate hai or chaahate hai ki china kii companiyaan bharat main nivesh kar yaheen utpaadan karen
 In this way the basic nature of india-china relations will change
 yah sambandh sirf len-dein kaa hi nahin rahegaa balki china kii companiyaan bharat ke dedicated industrial parkon main utpaadan karengi
 The first such park can be revealed during President Xi Jinping's visit to New Delhi and Gujarat on 16-17 September
 sankshep main, modi china ke guangdong model ko gujarat or desh main duusari jagahon par aajmaana chaahate hai
 Beijing is of the view that the relationship between the two countries may soon reach a point where economic relations will be overshadowed by strategic differences and India's western border dispute may not be resolved but relations will not remain tense
 chini adhikariyon or udyog jagat ke kartadhartaaon kaa maananaa he ki pehle ranneetik sarokaaron ne aarthik sambandhon kii sambhaavna ko simit kiya hua tha
 If India cannot allow China to enter certain areas — such as telecom for strategic reasons, then there are obstacles facing China — Chinese businessmen are always complaining of difficulties in getting visas
 bhartiya ity companiyon ko china ke sarkari udhyam vaale upakramon se theka lene ke liye hameshaa sangharsh karnaa padaa he
 a Chinese official, who attended a meeting with Modi in 2011, says, "we hope that the rest of India, like Modi's Gujarat, will prove favorable for investors
" aam dharna yah he ki pichley ek dashak main bharat nivesh ke icchhuk deshon ke liye ‘dikkaton se bharaa desh’ rahaa he
 This is confirmed by an example
 china ke arbapati construction vyavsaayee liyang vengen ne ek baar bhartiya adhikariyon se shikaayat kii thi ki unki nirmaan company, sani ne pune main ek nirmaan kaary main karodon dollar nivesh kiya he lekin unhen suraksha kaarnon se apane nijee jet se pune aane kii ijaajat nahin di gai
 Beijing resident Tang Lu is the editor of China's news agency, Xinhua
 ve kahati hai ki china main modi ko ‘nivesh samarthak’ or ‘aarthik sudhaar laane vaala’ netaa samaj jaataa he
 Not only this, Modi is also considered a powerful leader who can take stronger steps than the UPA government on issues like border dispute and Tibet
 “lekin aarthik masalon par unhen adhik vyaavhaarik netaa samaj jaataa he
 "but the biggest, possibly most complex factor that can determine the success of Modi's China projects is the unexpected and parallel rise of strong leaders alike in both countries
" modi kii tarah hi shi jinping ko bhi china main taqatvar netaa ke rup main dekha jaataa he, jo aarthik maamalon main yathartwaadee drushtikon rakhte hai or rashtriya suraksha ke maamle main kisi tarah kaa samjhauta nahin karnaa chaahate
 Xi Jinping is the son of reformist leader Xi Zhengzhun, who was instrumental in the establishment of Guangdong and SEZ

 Gone are the days when the consensus of the nine-member Politburo Standing Committee was required to make a major diplomatic decision, besides the approval of the People's Liberation Army
 jhang kehete hai, “purv netaa hu jintao ke vipareet shi ke paas sena samet adhik satta he
 "he is also the chairman of the National Security Commission and has full authority to take decisions, which had to be shared with other top leaders in the earlier situation
 ye do taqatvar netaa ek-duusare se kaise judenge yah anishchit he
 Doval says the two leaders were 'intimate' when they met in Brazil in July
 shi ne to kaha tha ki donon kii rajnatik yatra main ek samanta dikhti he
 Doval says, "I think the two feel they can work together

 It is believed that Britain feared that if India secured two-thirds of the votes, it would be very difficult for the Security Council to prevent India's candidate from being elected to the ICJ

 gujarat ke surat se ek aisi ajeebogareeb prem kahani saamne ai he ki sunne waalon ke rongte khadey ho jaaen or prem se unka bharosa uth jaae
 This story of deception and crime in love is such that it will be difficult to believe
 ek aisi lav story, jisamen ek ashiq ne hi apni mashooq kaa sir kalam kar diya
 It is not that he was an ordinary lover or that he was full of his girlfriend
 surat ke timba gaanv kaa rahane vaala pritesh patel shaadishuda tha, lekin uski nazren mumbai kii ek baar bala se aisi takaraayi ki vah sabakuch bhul gaya or use apana dil de baitha
 Pritesh looted crores of rupees on his girlfriend Jyoti Surjit Singh
 vah jald hi apni patni ko talaak dekar usase shaadi karne vaala tha, lekin tabhi aisa kuch hua ki uskaa sara prem nafrat main badal gaya or usne aisa kiya jo shaayad hi koi premi apni premika ke saath karnaa chaahe
 The story begins two years ago, when Pritesh went to Mumbai from Surat, Gujarat
 mumbai ghoomte hue pritesh ekadin ek baar main pahunchaa
 Bala was dancing several times in the bar
 tamaam logon kii nazaren danceron ke thumake or unke matakte jismon ko ghur rahi thim
 Then he was looking for love for himself in the eyes of one of the children
 tabhi achaanak uski nazaren in nazaron se takaraai
 At the first glance, those eyes landed in the depths of the heart
 phir to jaise un kaatil nigahon kii lat lag gai use
 Just the same day, he decided that if someone's right is entitled to these eyes, then only and only he will have it
 pritesh jyoti se milane kaa bahaanaa dhundne ke liye us baar main baar-baar jane laga or dhire-dhire vah jyoti ke dil main jagah banane main safal rahaa
 The love of both grew
 ab donon kii mulaakaaten badhane lageen
 Jyoti Surjit Singh, a resident of Bathinda, Punjab, was once a dancer and came to Mumbai only to overcome her family's woes
 yahaan wo kamaati thi or vahaan bhatinda main uski choti bahan ke saath saath uskaa parivaar palata tha
 Bala's beautiful Jyoti did not even know that her poverty was going to go away
 vah bhi aise ki usne kabhi sochaa bhi na hoga
 Jyoti was going to play in crores
 isi bich baar main hi jyoti kii mulaakaat pritesh patel se hui
 Jyoti is so dear to Pritesh Patel, a resident of Kamrej, Surat, that he changed his life in one stroke
 jyoti par pritesh paisa lutaata rahaa, wo khilakhilaati rahi
 Pritesh got Jyoti a car, got a bungalow, got clothes, decorated expensive jewelery on her neck
 donon vivaah kii yojana banane lage
 Pritesh did not like Jyoti dancing in the bar like this
 pritesh ne jyoti kii baar main dance karne kii naukari chhudvaa di
 Even Jyoti gave up living in Mumbai
 hameshaa saath rahane kaa bharosa dilaakar pritesh ne jyoti se uskaa kaam chhudvaa diya or bhatinda main 1
 Purchased a luxurious bungalow for 5 crores
 ab jyoti kii jindagi aisho-aaraam se katane lagi thi
 He had every valuables, expensive car and driver for the car
 pritesh jab jyoti se miltaa to lakhon rupee to sirf uske liye shoping main uda detaa
 But then he cut his throat from the hood and separated
 kyon kiya pritesh ne aisa jabaki jyoti to uski salgirah kaa jashn manaane hazaron kimi dur se ai thi
 On December 27, Jyoti reached Timba to celebrate Pritesh's birthday with his driver and his wife, where the two celebrated the anniversary together
 jiske baad chaaron log 4 din tak mumbai waapas laute or ek hotel main tehre, jahaan pritesh ne jyoti ko lakhon rupayon kii shopping bhi karai
 But after this Pritesh took Jyoti back to his village Timba on the pretext of showing a banana field in his village
 kamrej ke timba gaanv ke in kheton main pahunchate hi na jane pritesh par koun sa bhoot savaar hua or vah aashiq se kaatil ban baitha
 In front of Jyoti's driver Sandeep Singh and his wife Nikita, he cut Jyoti's throat from the carcass and separated her from the torso
 samajhnaa mushkil tha ki jyoti se bepanaah mohabbat karne vaale pritesh ne aakhir use itani beraham maut kyon di, jabaki tamaam daulat lutaaney ke baavjood vah jyoti se sirf or sirf sachhee mohabbat kii ummid kar rahaa tha
 The question was that why Pritesh loved the Nazis, raised every tantrum of it, fulfilled every wish, why did he die so mercilessly? Why did not his heart tremble with the blood seeping from his throat, why his heart did not melt with his scream, why he did not feel sorry for his helpless eyes
 kahin aisa to nahin tha ki jyoti se pritesh kaa dil bhar gaya tha or vah use raste se hataanaa chahta tha
 Probably not because for your information, let me tell you that Pritesh, who loved Jyoti, was not only married, but because of his love for Jyoti, he lived separately from his wife
 vah apnibivi ko talaak dene vaala thataaki jyoti ke saath ghar basaa sake
 Then he hit him with this ruthlessness, why this question had just arisen
 pritesh kii is khooni kahani main itane utaar-chadhaav the ki is kahani kaa anjaam to khooni hona hi tha
 Jyoti came as Pritesh and his wife's life
 jiske pyaar main pritesh is kadar divaana tha ki wo apana sabakuch usapar nyochaavar karne ko bekaraar rahata tha
 But the real story starts after this
 duusari taraf kahani zaraa ulti thi
 Jyoti was pretending to love Pritesh but secretly loved someone else
 jis jyoti ke liye pritesh apana sab kuch lutaa rahaa tha, vah ayyashi to pritesh ke paison par kar rahi thi magar pyaar kii pingen kisi or se badha rahi thi
 That is, he was also one in the story of Pritesh and Jyoti and he was a boy from Bathinda
 lekin kehete hai na, ishk or musk chhipaae nahin chhupate
 So one day this secret also opened
 27 disambar ko pritesh kaa berth de manaakar pritesh or jyoti apane driver ke saath mumbai main nae saal kaa jashn manaane nikle
 In Mumbai, he stayed in a hotel for about four days
 mumbai main rahane ke dauraan pritesh ko shaq hua ki jyoti chori chhipe kisi or se baat karti he
 When he tried to find out, it came to know that Jyoti is having an affair with another boy
 pritesh khud kothga hua mahasoos kar rahaa tha
 There was a lot of confusion in both
 magar pritesh kaa gussa thanda nahin padaa lihaaza usne banaaya jyoti kaa katl karne kaa plan
 According to the plan, Pritesh called Jyoti to show him a banana field at Kamrej in Surat and about 1 pm on Tuesday
 0 baje apane driver or uski bivi ke saath jyoti timba pahunchi
 When they reached the fields, Pritesh unloaded the driver and his wife from the car and took Jyoti alone to the banana farm and brought her to the banana field and killed her with her head
 jis vaqt police ne aaropee pritesh ko giraftaar kiya us vakt uski tishart khun se sani hui thi
 However, it is not yet clear whether the accused Pritesh has confessed his crime or not
 kehete hai kiye kii sazaa isi janm me mil jaati he
 Pritesh betrayed his wife for Jyoti and Jyoti committed infidelity to Pritesh for someone else
 magar pyaar ishk or mohabbat kaa yah khel jyoti ko bahut mahangaa padaa

 Prime Minister narendramodine while addressing the activist Mahakumbh held in Bhopal on Tuesday once again highlighted the failures of the UPA government
 centre kii upie sarkaar par bhartiya janata party shasit rajyon ke saath andekhi kaa aarope lagaate hue unhone kaha ki bijepi aglaa chunaav vikaas ke mudde par ladegi, jabakicongresssamaj ko todakar satta hathiyanna chaahati he
 However, PM Modi in his nearly 40-minute speech neither mentioned the world's biggest scheme like Ayushman Bharat Bharat Yojana nor did he give any reply to the Congress allegations of scam in Raffeldil
 itnaa hi nahin, chunaav kaa saamana karne ja rahaa madhya pradesh bhi unke bhaashanon se dur rahaa or unhone rajya kii teen baar kii bijepi sarkaar kii uplabdhiyaan bhi nahin ginaayin
 Highlights of PM Modi's speech: - Prime Minister Modi mocked the Congress and said that the 125-year-old party has reached such a position that it has to 'beg' small parties for alliance
 unhone kaha ki yadi congress ko gathjod ke liye sahyogi mil bhi jaaen to bhi yah gathbandhan safal nahin hoga
 -modi said that his government believes in social justice for all and his 'sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas' campaign is not a mere slogan
 -main 2001 se raajnneeti main aayaa hum, usase pehle main sanghathan main kaam kar rahaa tha
 But you have fiercely spewed venom against me
 piem modi ne aage kaha ki jitna keechad uchhaala he, camel utana hi khilaa he
 -10 years of sitting in Delhi, the UPA government behaved double, so now in Madhya Pradesh, they have to be brought to the earth
 madhya pradesh ko aage laane main bahut sangharsh karnaa padaa he
 Shivraj ji has given impetus to development and we have given full support in it
 lekin ab sab kuch taiyaar he or ab chalaang lagane kaa mauka he
 - Our strength workers
 hamen chunaav dhanabal, baahubal se nahin, balki janabal se ladanaa he
 Vote bank politics will have to stop the poison being spread in the society
 yahi kaaran he ki teen talaak jaise muddon par us dal kaa najariya alag he, jisaki mukhiya mahila he
 -modi attacked the Congress without mentioning the Rafale deal and said, the oldest party in the country not able to form coalitions in the country is making alliances with the countries of the world
 congress ke is ravaiye ko desh ke jaagruk nagarikon ko samajhnaa hoga
 Referring to the birth anniversary of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay, Modi said, BJP is such a party which runs on Integral Humanism
 aisa dal duniya main nahin he, jo maanavtaa kii baat karata he
 Apart from this, PM Modi referred to the familyism of the Congress
 saath hi muslim mahilaon ke haq kii baat karte hue teen talaak kaa bhi mudda uthaaya
 However, he later claimed that the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh Shivraj Singh Chauhan would be the BJP government again in the state, describing him as a public servant and his friend
 yani madhya pradesh kii dharti se piem modi kaa puraa bhaashan centre sarkaar or congress va upie sarkaar kii aalochana tak simit rahaa or usamen puri tarah 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav kii taiyaari najar ai
 Indian women may wear jeans and kurta-leggings but their attachment to saree does not diminish
 khaas maukon par yaa yun hi kabhi khaas dikhne ke liye sari se behatar koi vikalp he bhi nahin
 By the way, you must have noticed one thing that many ladies look very good in saris and while looking at some, it seems that nothing is made
 yah antar isliye he ki unmahilaon ko yah sikret pataa heki sari ko achche tareeke se kairi kis tarah karnaa he
 For example, how to wear jewelery, what the blouse should be, whether the saree is according to the occasion or not
 
 
 
 If you too give a special place to your wardrobe and want to leave a different impression every time you wear it, then follow these tips suggested by experts
 yakeen maniye iske baad aapako sabhi sari star kahenge!sahi persesadi ke saath klach yaa chota potli purse haath main rakhen
 Never carry a big bag with a sari
 sari apneaap main hi itnaa khubasurat or najaakat bharaa paridhaan he ki iske saath bade yaa haivi luk vaala purse fabtaa nahin he
 If your sari is heavy, do not take the clutch with too much work
 halki sari ke saath luk ko haivi dikhaane ke liye brit or work vaala klach haath main rakh sakati hai
 What to wear on feet It is true that footwear does not look much after wearing a sari
 lekiniskaa matlab yah bhi nahin he ki aapako jo chaahe vah pahanane kii chhot mil gaihai
 Sports shoes
 
 
 to katai nahin or na hi belij, kolhapuri chappal ko sari ke saath pahanen
 Don't wear wedges and low-heeled footwear (also called kitten heels) with a sari
 sade or achche luk main hill vaale footvier sari ke saath khub fabenge
 
 peticot kaisaa hokai mahilaayein flair vaale (jo neeche se qamar ke mukaable zyada chaude hote hai) peticot pahenti hai
 If you do not have much practice of walking in a saree, then avoid wearing it
 isaki bajaay aap street feet vaale peticot pahanen
 
 blouse ho figure ke mutabidgar aap sari main vaaki khubasurat laganaa chaahati hai to blouse ko apane figure ke hisaab se taiyaar karavaaen
 For example, if your arms are thick, do not wear cut sleeves blouses
 qamar par charbi ho to blouse ko thodaa lanbaa silavaayen
 Don't make others look styled, but see what suits you
 
 Do not become a jewelery shop
 It feels like a lot to decorate with traditional dress like saree
 lekin iskaa matlab yah nahin ki sari ke saath aap khud ko gahanon se lad len
 Wear beautiful big earrings with a light-looking sari
 yaa baaki gahanon ko nazarandaaj karte hue bas ek acha maang tikaa lagaaein
 If the sari is heavy, wear a nice bracelet instead of thin chains, short tops in ears and lots of bangles

 indvseng mumbai test : bhubaneshwar kaa thro ampire ke sir main laga, maidan par gire, sab ho gaye chintit Worshiping God brings peace to the mind and satisfaction to the soul
 puja-paath or sadhana main itani shakti hoti he ki ye sabhi manokamana purna kar sakati he
 The worship of God with a sincere mind removes the worries and makes one feel infinite peace
 lekin puja ke dauraan ishwar kii aradhana tab tak puri nahin hoti, jab tak bhagwaan kii aarti naa kii jaae
 In scriptures, the special importance of Aarti in worship has been mentioned
 mana jaataa he ki sachche man or shrriddha se kii gai aarti behad kalyankari hoti he
 The praise offered during Aarti purifies and purifies the mind and atmosphere
 aarti kii mahima-agar koi vyakti mantra nahin jaanata, puja kii vidhi nahin jaanata lekin aarti kar letaa he, to bhagwaan uski puja ko purna rup se sweekaar kar lete hai
 Aarti has religious significance as well as scientific significance

 isse aas-paas ke vaataavaran main maujuud nakaartmak urja bhaag jaati he or vaataavaran main sakaaratmak urja kaa sanchaar hone lagata he
 Importance of Aarti - The importance of Aarti is first discussed in the "skanda Purana"
 - aarti hindu dharm kii puja parampara kaa ek atyant mahatvapurn kaary he
 - Aarti of Gods and Goddesses is performed at the end of any Puja text, Yajna, ritual
 - aarti kii prakriya main ek thaal main jyoti or kuch vishesh vasteen rakhkar bhagwaan ke saamne ghumaate hai
 - Placing different items in the plate has different importance
 - lekin sabase zyada mahatv hota he aarti ke saath gaai jane vaali stuti kaa
 It is believed that the more aarti is sung, the more effective the puja is
 aarti karne ke niyam-- bina puja upasna, mantra jaap, prarthana yaa bhajan ke sirf aarti nahin kii ja sakati he
 - It is always best to perform aarti only at the end of any worship or prayer
 - aarti kii thaal main kapur yaa ghi ke deepak donon se hi jyoti prajjwalit kii ja sakati he
 - If you perform Aarti with a lamp, then it should be Panchmukhi
 - iske saath puja ke phool or kumkum bhi jarur rakhen
 - Turn the aarti plate in such a way that the shape of ॐ can be formed
 - aarti ko bhagwaan ke charnon main chaar baar, naabhi main do baar, mukh par ek baar or sampoorn sharir par saat baar ghumana chahie
 Aarti for wishing fulfillment- Put yellow flowers in Vishnu's Aarti
 - devi or hanuman ji kii aarti main laal phool rakhen
 Keep a bell leaf with flowers in the aarti of Shiva
 - ganesh ji kii aarti main durva jarur rakhen
 - It is best to keep yellow flowers in the regular Aarti done at home

 dilli gangrape ke mukhya aaropee ram singh ke sharir par chot ke nishaan mili hai
 Ram Singh's post-mortem in AIIMS has been completed
 puri postmortem report abhi saamne nahin ai he
 According to the initial report, Ram Singh died due to hanging
 lekin ram singh ke sharir par chot ke nishaan milane se uski khudakushi par shaq or gaharaa ho gaya he
 Ram Singh's family members are already alleging that his son has been murdered in Tihar Jail
 tihaad jail prashasan yahi daawa kar rahaa he ki dilli gangrape ke ahm aaropee ram singh ne jail ke apane kamare main khudakushi karke jaan de di lekin uskaa parivaar apane bete kii maute kii is vajah ko sire se khaarij kar rahaa he
 The family and the lawyers who fought Ram Singh's case in the court argued that Ram Singh was murdered and not killed

 One hand of Ram Singh was useless
 wo sirf ek haath se wo khudakushi kaise saktaa he
 3 more people were present in Ram Singh's room
 uname se kisi kii bhi najar ramsingh par kyon nahin padi
 Ram Singh was about 5 and a half feet in length, so how did he reach the noose from the grill 8 feet high from the ground
 kamare ke aasapaas sisitivi camera kyon nahin lagaaya gaya
 Outside the room, no guard saw Ram Singh hanging himself
 inhen saare sawaalon ke chalate shaayad baba ramdev bhi sibiai jaanch kii maang kar rahe hai
 Whatever be the truth behind the death of Ram Singh, but this incident has proved that there is no guarantee for the safety of life of the prisoners inside the country's largest and safest Tihar Jail

 According to Jitendra Mohan Sharma, Senior Advocate of the Islamic Court of Supreme Court, the Sunni Central Waqf Board, in its plea, said that the Babri Masjid was not demolished during the reign of Babar, but instead of Idgah, according to Jitendra Mohan Sharma, Senior Advocate of the Supreme Court
 Was made on haalanki bhartiya puraatatv surveykshan (ASI) kii 2003 kii report main saaf kiya gaya ki masjid ke neeche se koi islamic dhaancha nahin mila, jisase sabit hota he ki masjid idgah par nahin banaai gai
 According to Sharma, the ASI also said that the excavation found evidence of Hinduism from beneath the mosque
 supreme court ke senior edwocket vinay kumaar garg kaa bhi yahi kahana he ki supreme court ne bhartiya sakshya adhinium ke tahat eesai kii report ko saboot ke rup main sweekaar kiya or muslim paksh kaa daawa khaarij ho gaya

 vivaadit jameen par pratikul kabje kaa daawa khaarijasupreme court ke senior edwocket jitendra mohan sharma ke mutabik supreme court main muslim paksh ne edwars pajeshan kaa daawa kiya
 This means that the Muslim side did not have the actual ownership of the disputed land, but claimed the title on the basis of possession
 muslim paksh kii daleel thi ki agar hindu paksh kii baat maan bhi lee jaae ki mandir ko dhahaakar masjid banaai gai, to us par edwars pajeshan kaa adhikaar banataa he
 The Babri Masjid was built there during the reign of Babur in 1528 and was occupied by Muslims
 haalanki supreme court ne muslim paksh ke daawey ko sire se khaarij kar diya
 Earlier, the Allahabad High Court had also rejected the argument of the adversary possession of the Muslim side

 Muslims did not use the entire disputed land, Senior Advocate Jitendra Mohan Sharma said that the entire disputed land in Ayodhya was not used by Muslims
 mandir ke bhitari ahaate main masjid thi, jabaki bahari ahaate main hindu lagaataar puja karte rahe
 The Supreme Court held that 2 of the Muslims
 77 acre vivaadit jameen ke puure hisse main kabja nahin tha
 Muslims did not offer Namaz on the entire disputed ground
 iske alaava kai baar namaaj padhanaa bhi band rakhaa gaya
 At the same time, Hindu parties used to worship the land continuously in one part
 court ne mana ki mandir ke bahari ahaate main bhagwaan ram kii puja hoti rahi
 Therefore, the entire disputed land is not claimed by the Muslim side
 court ne kaha ki hindu paksh kii tarah muslim paksh kaa bhi daawa he
 Hence this land is given to Ramlala Virajaman
 senior edwocket vinay kumaar garg kaa kahana he ki agar koi kisi jameen par apane kabje kaa daawa karata he or uske ek hisse ko istemaal karnaa chhod detaa he, to uskaa adhikaar khatm mana jaataa he

 However, from the date of the construction of the mosque, 1856-57 i
e
 more than 325 years, there was no proof of offering Namaz on the disputed land
 is darmyaan vivaadit jameen par kabje ko lekar muslim pakshakaar koi thos saboot bhi nahin pesh kar paae
 The Supreme Court said that as far as the outer courtyard of the temple is concerned, it is not possible to accept the possession of Muslims there
 mandir ke bahari ahaate par hindu puja karte the or unka kabja tha, yah baat saaf ho rahi he

 After this, Hindus were allowed to worship in the outer courtyard of the temple
 chabutara par bhagwaan ram kii puja karnaa is baat kaa saaf sanket he ki vahaan par hindu lagaataar puja karte rahe hai
 When a brick wall was built on the disputed land in Ayodhya, there was no mention of the ownership of any Hindu or Muslim
 is diwaar ko sirf hindu or muslimon ke bich shanti bahaali ke liye banaaya gaya tha

 Are the days of cheap samosas in Pakistan gone? Ending the legal battle over the price of samosa, the Supreme Court has rejected a notification of the Punjab government where the price of one 'samosa' was fixed at six rupees
 is hafte kii shuruyaat tak samose kii keemat par prantiy sarkaar or punjab bekars and sweets federation ke bich kanoonee sangharsh chhidaa hua tha
 In 2009, the City District Government Lahore fixed the price of a samosa at six rupees and the magistrates were fining the shopkeepers selling the samosa at a higher price
 punjab bekars and sweets federation ne apane adhyaksh choudhary mohammad afjal ke madhyam se is faisle ko chunauti di lekin lahore ucch nyaayalay ne yachika khaarij kar di
 The petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court Lahore Registry and contended that the samosa has not been notified under the Punjab Food (control) Act 1958 and hence the provincial government cannot fix its price
 tippaniyan The counsel for the Punjab government said that the government has the right to fix the price of the goods which are being sold to the people
 baharhaal, supreme court ne punjab bekars and sweets kii yachika ko sweekaar karte hue mangalvaar ko jari adhisuchana khaarij kar di
 By the beginning of this week, there was a legal conflict between the provincial government and the Punjab Bakers and Sweets Federation over the cost of samosas
 varsh 2009 main city district government lahore ne ek samosa kii keemat chah rupee tay kii thi or isse adhik keemat par samosa bechney vaale dukandaaron par magistrate jurmaana kar rahe the
 The Punjab Bakers and Sweets Federation, through its chairman Chaudhary Muhammad Afzal, challenged the decision but the Lahore High Court dismissed the petition
 yachikakarta ne supreme court lahore registry main apil kii or tark diya ki samosa ko punjab khaadya padaarth (niyantran) adhinium 1958 ke tahat adhishuchet nahin kiya gaya he isliye isaki keemat ko prantiy sarkaar tay nahin kar sakati
 The comments punjab sarkaar ke vakil ne kaha ki sarkaar ke paas adhikaar he ki vah un padaarthon kii keemat tay kare jise logon ko bechaa ja rahaa he
 However, the Supreme Court rejected the notification issued on Tuesday, accepting the petition of Punjab Bakers and Sweets

 vimaanamen kru ke saath budtamiji karnaa yaa ashobhaneey vyavhaar karnaa mahangaa pad saktaa he
 So expensive that you may have to return by bus instead of Airbus
 dilli ke ek parivaar ne yah sabak sikh liya
 According to a report published in an English newspaper, a family of Delhi was returning from Spice Jet's flight to Kathmandu that something happened to him
 ek 62 varshiya sajjan vimaan main bich vaali seat (oil) par baithe hue the or unhen neend aa gai
 In his sleep, one of his legs came on the way
 vahaan se guzarati hui air hostess ne use jabardasti hataa diya
 At this, the gentleman not only got up from sleep but started to turn red-yellow on the airhostess
 unke parivaar or vimaan ke kru main garmagarmee hone lagi
 The airline company says that the gentleman slapped the airhostess in anger
 vimaan udne hi vaala tha lekin captain ne unhen plane se utarane kaa aadesh de diya
 He had to get off the plane unwillingly
 lekin parivaar ko uske baad bahut pareshaaniyon se guzarana padaa
 Apart from the wife of the gentleman, a nine-year-old child of his family was also on the plane
 un sabhi ko neeche utarana padaa
 After that he did not get any flight tickets and came to Delhi after taking a bus and traveling for 30 hours
 udhar, un sajjan kaa kahana he ki vimaan paanch ghante let tha
 He was tired and fell asleep as soon as he went to the seat
 neend main unki ek taang thodi baahar ho gai hogi jise airhostess bahut nirmam tareeke se hataa diya
 Then he got hot again
 unka kahana tha ki unki patni ne garmigarmi ke liye maafee bhi maangi lekin vimaan ke payalat ne unhen utar jane kaa aadesh diya
 Now he is asking Sajjan Airlines not only to apologize but also to seek compensation
 unka kahana he ki vah 36 saal se vimaan main safar kar rahe hai or unka saath aisa kabhi nahin hua
 Let me tell you that these days the airlines have zero tolerance policy
 iske tahat jaraa bhi shorsharaba yaa ladaai-jhagada bardaasht nahin kiya jaataa he
 The passengers doing this are either unloaded or handed over to the police
 spice jet kaa kahana he ki chunki yatri ne thappad maaraa he or aisa karte hue kai sahyatriyon ne dekha he, uskaa faisla sahi he

 The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has filed an affidavit in the Supreme Court against Chidambaram saying that Chidambaram along with his close confidants and co-conspirators created a network of shell companies in India and abroad and there is enough evidence
 halafname main kaha gaya he ki shell companiyon kaa sanchaalan karne vaale log chidambaram ke sampark main hai or agency ke paas iske saboot hai
 Only interrogation in custody will reveal the truth
 yah na keval idi kaa desh ke prati kartavya he, balki kaale dhan ko ujagar kare or benami companiyon main jamaa dhanrashi ko bhi jabt kare
 ED has alleged that 17 anonymous foreign bank accounts and 10 expensive assets were bought in India and abroad
 ED questioned Chidambaram in December 2018 and January 1 and January 21, 2019 but did not cooperate
 idi ne halafname main kaha ki chidambaram ek prabhaavshaalee vyakti hai or unhone khud or apane parivaar se duuri banane ke liye shell companiyon ke share holding pattern main badlaav kiye hai
 The international community believes that money laundering is a serious crime as India is a member of the International Forum - Financial Action Task Force

 25 din or 5 katl
 We are not talking about a serial serial killer who is killing someone every fifth day, but we are talking about those elders of Delhi NCR who are becoming easy victims of slayer just because they are elderly
 abhi is maheene ke 25 din hi gujarey hai ki dilli ensiaar main 5 se zyada bujurg apni jaan ganvaa chuke hai
 Even more disturbing is that most of them have become victims of robbers while being alone in their home
 dilli ke posh lajpat nagar ilaake ke is makaan main rahane vaale ajay ahuja jab ravivaar shaam ko apane ghar laute, to makaan ke andar kaa manjar dekh kar unke pair kaanp uthe
 The house was locked and the corpse of an elderly 86-year-old mother lay inside
 unka katl ho chukaa tha, lekin ye haal ke dinon main dilli kii koi pehali or iklauti aisi vaardaat nahin thi jab ghar main akeli rah rahi kisi bujurg mahila kakatlahua tha, balki 5 bujurgon ko isi tarah ghar main ghus kar maut ke ghat utaara ja chukaa he
 In Lajpatnagar Vimala Ahuja was hit with a sharp weapon on his head
 ghar kii haalat dekh kar saaf tha ki katl ke peeche kaa makasad lutpaat hi rahaa hoga
 Because Rs 10 lakh was also missing from the house after the incident, but when the police started investigating the case, it got clues that the murderer had made a friendly entry into the house
 yani andar aane ke liye use vimala mehara ke saath koi jor jabardastee nahin kerani padi
 In such a situation, the police suspect that the murderer may be knowledgeable
 ghar ke first floor par vimala apane pati ke saath rahati thim, jabaki bete bahu top floor par
 When the incident happened to him, there was no one in the house
 ab police ne kai timen bana kar is maamle kii jaanch shuru kii he, lekin is vaardaat ke saath hi ye baat phir ek baar saaf ho gai he ki dilli ensiaar main bujurg bilkul bhi surakshit nahin hai
 The recent murder of a 70-year-old veteran Vijay Kumar in Mayur Vihar's news apartment also testifies to this fact
 6 julyindirapuram, gajiabadshriram residency apartment main mahaj 5 hazaar rupye ke liye 58 saal kii bujurg mahila kaa katl kiya gaya
 7 July West Vihar, Delhi 80-year-old elderly woman Krishna Devi was strangled to death for looting
 ghar se 12 lakh luute gaye
 11 July Kalkaji, Delhi 70-year-old Harmeet Kaur entered and killed her house

 is baar bhi shaq lutpaat ke liye katl kaa he
 PM Modi said, 'he who did not get the benefit also used to say that the person has got the benefit, now i too will get it
 is vishwaas kii ek ahm visheshta he
 Some people should say such a big mandate that you won the election but the country lost the election
 main samajhataa hum ki isse bada bharat ke loktantr or janata janardan kaa koi apmaan nahin ho saktaa
 i would like to ask if India lost in Wayanad? Did India lose in Rae Bareli? ' The PM said, "when there is no confidence in yourself, lack of power, then excuses are found
 aatmachintan karne or apni galatiyon ko swikaarne kii jinaki taiyaari nahin hoti wo phir EVM par thikra phodte hai
 So tell your colleagues that, look, we lost because of EVM
 is chunaav kii ek visheshta he ki east, west, north, south sabhi kone se bahumat ke saath bijepi or endie jitkar aayaa hai
 Those who have lost, whose dreams have been shattered, cannot greet the voters
 main matadaataaon kaa sir jhukaakar koti-koti abhinandan karata hum
 The PM said, 'sometimes we were left 2 in the House
 hamako 2 yaa 3 bas, kahkar baar-baar hamaara majaak udaaya jaataa tha
 But we had faith in the workers, trust of the people of the country
 hamamen parishram karne kii paraakaashtha thi or isse hamane phir se party ko khadaa kiya
 We did not blame evms
 congress kii kuch na kuch aisi samasya he ki ye vijay ko bhi nahin pachaa pate or 2014 ke baad se main dekh rahaa hum ki ye paraajay ko bhi sweekaar nahin kar pate
 The electoral process has been and should continue to improve
 khule man se is par charchaa honi chahie
 But to say without discussion that we are not in favor of one country or one election, at least we should discuss it
 ye samay kii maang he ki desh main kam se kam matadaata suchi to ek ho
 The PM said, "you need Old India, where the decision of the cabinet is torn in the press conference, where the entire Navy is used for the outing
" jahaan jal thal or nabh har jagah ghotaale hi ghotaale hon
 But the people of the country are not ready to take India to the old times
 desh kii janata apane sapanom ke anuroop nae bharat kii pratiksha kar rahi he or ham sabhi ko samuhik prayaason se saamaanya maanvi ke sapanom ko puraa karne kaa prayaas karnaa chahie
 He said, "I am surprised that the negativity and contradiction went to such an extent that toilets, sanitation, Jan Dhan, yoga programs and even Make in India were mocked
" har cheez main desh ne nakaaratmakataa ko bhalee-bhaanti dekha gaya he
 Do we want the old India that reaches out to support the piecemeal gang? jahaan inspector raaj ho, jahaan intervyuu ke naam par bhrashtachar ho
 The people of the country are not ready to take India to the old times
 'piem ne kaha, 'sabakaa saath sabakaa vikaas kaa mantra lekar ham chale the lekin 5 saal ke hamaare kaarykaal ko dekhakar desh kii janata ne usamen sabakaa vishwaas rupi amrit joda he
 But Azad saheb is seeing something blurred, as long as everything is seen through political spectacles, it will be seen blurred and hence if we remove political spectacles, we will see the future of the country
 shaayad isiilie gaalib ne kaha tha ki taumr gaalib ye bhul karata rahaa, taumr gaalib ye bhul karata rahaa, dhul chehre par thi or main aaina saafe karata rahaa'piem ne kaha, 'hamaara maananaa he ki sardaar sahab agar desh ke pehle pradhanmantri hote to shaayad aaj desh main jammu-kashmir kii samasya nahin hoti, hindustan ke gaanvon kii aaj jo jaddojahad he wo bhi na hoti
 Sardar Saheb was made the first Home Minister of the country by the Congress, he was a firm Congressman
 lekin main hairaan hum ki jab gujarat main chunaav hote hai to wo congress ke poster main najar aate hai, lekin desh bhar main kahin najar nahin aate
 Congress should also take NRC credit

 ---input bhashaa se The easier it is to love someone, the harder it is to keep it
 ek rishta tabhi chalata he jab donon taraf se hi ek duusare ke prati baraabar ke prayaas kiye jate hai
 There are also situations in many people's lives when they have to break their relationship despite being in love with each other
 ye hai brallep karne kii vajahen
 
 
 1
 aksar dekha jaataa he jab ham kisi se pyaar karte hai to us vyakti ko for granted le lete hai
 Which is why the partner feels that there is no need for them in your life
 apni jarurat mahasoos naa hone ke kaaran vyakti ko insikyor mahasoos hone lagata he or dhire-dhire rishte main kadavaahat aane lagati he
 Because of which people breakup even after loving their partner
 2
 This is the biggest reason for the breakdown of the relationship that nowadays people have become so busy in their lives that they are unable to give time to their partner
 jis vajah se unke bich thik se baat hi nahin paati or dhire-dhirecomunication gapaitna bad jaataa he ki pyaar hone ke baavjood log brallep kar lete hai
 3
 kisi bhi rishte kii buniyaad pyaar or vishwaas par tiki hoti he
 But when two people in a love relationship start hiding things from each other, this trust starts to break
 chhupaai gai baat chahen choti ho yaa badi, lekin ye rishte main daraar daal detii he
 Due to which your partner keeps distance from you even if you do not want to
 4
 Comparing your partner with any other girl or boy is enough to break the curry
 duusare vyakti ke saath tulana karne sa partner kaa dil to dukhata hi he saath hi unhen beijjati kaa ehsaas bhi hota he
 Due to which the relationship of love breaks
 5
 Periodically praising your partner brings sweetness to the relationship
 lekin kuch log kabhi bhi apane partner kii tarif hi nahin karte, balki choti-choti baton par unki galatiyon kaa ehsaas karaate hai
 Due to which, after a time people start getting irritable and even after loving their partner, they break up

 The Namvars were Namvars hindi aalochana ke kshetra main un sa na duja koy
 The strength of his dominance was that about whom, about writing, he filled a few sentences, he became a writer
 banaras chute arsa biit gaya, par aakhri saans tak vah vahiin ke the
 
 
 Banarasipan, typical Banarasi snub
 kheti ke na sahi shabdon ke jameendaar jo tehre
 
 
 The question may arise that what was there in Delhi then? Namvar was the head of the literary monks who had a hand in making the center of power the center of literature
 sahityakaron ke jamghat ke raja ke rup main namvar singh ne bahut pehle hi apane ko is kadar sthapit kar liya tha ki jis kisi ne bhi likhnaa-padhanaa janaa, siikhaa, chapa, chaahe dilli kaa ho, yaa dilli ke baahar kaa
 
 
 When he came to Delhi, it was probably the most necessary imperative to stick to literature in the name of Namvar
 haalanki yah kab or kaise hua iskaa bhaan nahin
 But this practice continued till recently
 
 
 jis kisi ne likhaa sabase pehle namvar ko dikhaane gaya
 He praised, then established otherwise
 
 
 
 But the Namvars were the same till the last breath, the rustic, the Banarsi, the stem with the weight of gravity, wrapped in a dhoti-kurta
 bina jhuke, belos khadey
 Namvar, the epitome of the typical village, farm, barn, and soil in this metropolis
 ham sabake, aap sab ke namvar
 Words used to flutter when he spoke
 kisi ko chubte to kisi ko lubhaate
 When he got news of his illness, there was a panic in the literary world, there was a panic
 log prarthana karne lage, shubhakamanaayen jaahir karne lage
 Started worrying soshal media par tasviren ghoomane lageen
 The news came that Namvar was recovering
 
 
 acha laga, namvar umr ko, beemaari ko, brain hamerej ko, maut ko pachhaadne main jute the
 But i wish it was permanent
 
 
 unke naam se meri vakphiyat bachapan main hi ho gai thi
 Chandauli district was not formed then, but he and his brother Dr
 Kashinath Singh were among the most educated people in the area

 But the first meeting was on the death of Kashi's legendary cinematographer, journalist S
 Atibal

 How i reached Varanasi with Dr
 Kashinath Singh before the preparations for Atibal ji's last visit in the twilight of dawn is still a mystery to me
 aaj ke daur main to log sthaneey str par antim vidaai ke vakt bhi upasthiti nahin darj kara pate
 Anyway 
 
 namvar hindi ke sarvottam aalochak the
 But he also tried his hand at poetry
 ek tarah se shuruyaat isi se kii
 Although poems did not get better
 par koi ise kah saktaa tha kya? unka kad itnaa bada tha ki log shraddha ke bahaane natmastak ho sach kehane kaa saahas bhi na juta pate
 But the truth is that the Namvars were not meant for poetry
 ve ek behad achche vaktaa the or baari padhaaku
 He was a thinker
 unke vyaakhyaan main bhashaa ke pravaah ke saath vichaaron kii lay hoti
 Namwar Singh, No Dr
 namvar singh hindi aalochana ke shikhar purush the
 He was called the Acharya of the oral tradition of criticism
 jaise baba nagarjun
 To some extent Trilochan, or for folk collections Devendra Satyarthi, village-village, city-town, roaming around, gatherings of farmers, laborers, students, young people, intellectuals and scholars, in seminars to arouse democratic sympathy by reciting his poems, stories, stories While working, Namvar Singh would roam around and fight ideological battles
 haalanki namvar singh ke jeevankaal main kuch log vyangyatmak lahaze main yah baat kehete ki namvar singh likhte nahin, bolte bhar hai
 But anyone who has heard Namvar's lectures knows how much he enriched Hindi literature and criticism with his ideas even without writing for years
 phir namvar ne jitna bhi likhaa, vah bhi hindi sahitya ke itihaas or aalochana ke kshetra manr nayaa maandand prastut karne ke sadrush tha
 Baba Nagarjuna had said the presence of Trilochan Shastri in Varanasi on May 28, 1988, in the procession organized by Progressive Writers Association on the sixty years of Namvar Singh, "with a view to carry things to the general public in our country, books Speaking is more important than writing to reach ideas to those who have been taken away from
 sthapit (or sthavar bhi) vishvavidhyalayon kii tulana main yah jangam viapeeth zyada jaruri he
 Namvar is the Chancellor of this Jangam Vidyapeeth
 is viapeeth kaa koi mukhyalay nahin hota
 It organizes knowledge delivery sessions
 yah he surasati ke bhandar kii apurab baat
 It should not be seen by anyone
 ”dow
 Namvar Singh's audience included not only writers, critics, literature lovers, Hindi people, literature teachers and students but also curious and thought-lovers of other languages

 In this sense, Dr
 namvar singh hindi aalochana kii vaachik parampara ke keval acharya bhar na the, balki samooche santhaan the
 Namwar Singh was a strong, possibly the most powerful voice in Hindi today against fundamentalism, conservatism, superstition, artism, individualism, etc
 antarrashtriya str par aaj kaa samrajyavad rashtron ke khilaaf, saanskrithik swaittata ke khilaaf, janata or janatantr kii chetana ke khilaaf jo kuch bhi kar rahaa he, hindi main uskaa adhyatan gyaan namvar singh se adhik bahut kam logon ko hoga
 Namwar Singh was a Marxist by thoughts
 unhone marxvad ko adhyayan kii praddati ke rup main, chintan paddati ke rup main, samaaj main krantikari parivartan laanevaale maardarshak siddhant ke rup main, jivan or samaaj ko maanviya banaanevaale saundarya-siddhant ke rup main sweekaara tha
 He formed a large team and promoted the tradition of contemplation
 is vaicharik, academik, saahitiyik, saanskrithik abhiyaan main namvar singh ek ore to vichaarheenta kii vyaavhaarik kaat karte rahe, duusari taraf vaikalpik vichaardhaara kii ore se lokshikshan bhi karte rahe
 Atmaalochana is an essential part of the Marxist study method and its creativity
 ek marxvaadi hone ke naate unhone jeevanabhar atmalochan ko bhi sweekaara
 Many examples of this are found in his lectures and writings
 baharhaal, yah unki ahmiyat hi thi ki vah patna main bolen yaa bhopal main, banaras main bolen yaa dilli main, ghar main bolen yaa kaaryakramon main, unki aawaaj puri hindi pattee main sanchaar madhyamon ke jariye goonjati thi
 Perhaps this is why power was shaken by his thoughts
 namvar singh ke vyaktitv ke anek pahalu hai, jinamein unki pahchaan alag-alag jhalkati he
 His mentor, teacher, professor, speaker, spokesperson, leader, administrator, husband, father, friend, brother, comrade, reviewer, etc
 should be critically considered and looked at as a person who is Namvar Singh Carried out social, family, community and ideological role and behavior
 unke virdohi unpar jatvaad kaa aarope bhi lagaate rahe or yah bhi kehete rahe ki namvar singh kii aalochana style kaa sabase khatarnaak pahalu yah he ki vah kisi bhi lekhak yaa vyakti kaa bhavishya kharaab kar sakate the, vah bhi bina kisi saarvajanik vaktavy ke
 That is, through his personal conversations, he was able to take many capable talents of Hindi into the caves of oblivion
 par yah unka ekatarfa parichay he
 From what he gave to Hindi, what he got is enough to tell what he was
 namvar singh sahi myne main hindi sahitya, aalochana va janata kii janchetana ke pratinidhi or pravaktaa the
 Born on 28 July 1926 in Jeyanpur village of Chandauli, when was a boy Bharatendu Harishchandra, Acharya Mahavirprasad Dwivedi, Jaishankar Prasad, Suryakant Tripathi Nirala, Sumitra Nandan Pant, Acharya Ramchandra Shukla, Premchand, Acharya Hazariprasad Dwivedi, Dr

 Anyway, bye Namvar! Tribute to literature Aaj Tak! mashhoor vakil or aam aadmi party ke netaa prashanth bhushan ne party se istifa dene kaa ishaara kiya he
 Prashanth ndtv
 com par kejariwal ke naam likhe khule khat main kejariwal par aarope lagaaya he ki pichley saal vah rahul gandhi se baat karne ko bekaraar the, taaki dilli main dobaaraa se congress ke samarthan se AAP kii sarkaar banaai ja sake
 Prashant has accused Kejriwal in his letter that last year he wanted to talk to Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi
 taaki unhen dilli main dobaaraa aam aadmi party sarkaar ko samarthan dene ke liye manaaya ja sake
 For this you also spoke to Nikhil Dey, but Nikhil refused to do so
 aapako ye samajhnaa hoga ki haa main haa milaane vaale logon ke saath aap bahut dur nahin ja paaenge
 Our party was formed with many ideals, you and your circle betrayed those ideals
 aam aadmi party main bhi ab supremeo or hai kaman kii samskruti aa chuki he
 After winning in Delhi, you should have shown your best qualities, but it is a pity that after the victory you presented the worst image
 aap par sawaal uthaane waalon ko party se nikaal dena stallin kii yaad dilaataa he
 God and history will not forget you for what you have done with the party
 prashanth bhushan ne apni chitthee kaa ant 'good bai and good lack' likhakar kiya he
 Prashant while addressing Kejriwal in the letter said that the dream he had dreamed of together would not be fulfilled by running a 5-year government in Delhi
 unhone aisi ashanka jataai he ki agar arvind kaa bartaav or ravaiya aisa hi rahaa, to is sapane ko ek du:swapn main badalane main der nahin lagegi
 Though Prashant Bhushan has not formally said anything about leaving the party, this open letter and especially the line 'good bye and Good Luck' written at the end of it as a sign of his resignation from the party being seen
 ndtv
 In this open letter written like an article on com, Prashant has told how Arvind gave a provocative speech in the National Council meeting, due to which many mlas were agitated and he made noise of expelling us as traitors
 
 prashanth ne likhaa ve log mere pita kii taraf aise daude jaise unhen jaan se maar denge
 Prashant wrote that you did not even give us a chance to reply and voting was done without any discussion
 unhone aarope lagaaya he ki rashtriya parishad main zyaadaatar aise log maujuud the, jo parishad ke sadsy hi nahin the
 He also expressed grief over the decision not to conduct independent videography, not to allow the Lokpal to attend the meeting and to expose him and other colleagues from the national executive in an undemocratic manner
 baad main party dwaara jari kiye gaye arvind ke bhaashan ke video ko bhi unhone edited qaraar diya
 Prashant told how after the Lok Sabha elections, once again the efforts to form a government with the support of the Congress started in Delhi, he started having differences with Arvind and despite saying many times, Arvind did not listen to him
 yahaan tak ki piesi or enai kii meeting main liye gaye faislon ko bhi kejariwal ne palat diya gaya or apni manmarjee chalaai

 On the one hand, while the BJP won an overwhelming majority in the Lok Sabha Election, the party has been in a tizzy after the badly defeated Congress
 rahul gandhi congress pad se istipha dene ke liye taiyaar hai, jabaki party ke baaki netaa unhen aisa na karne ke liye aagrah kar rahe hai
 At the same time, Punjab minister and former cricketer Navjot Singh Sidhu has to stand in the dock of his own party
 philhal loksabhaa chunaav main congress ko mili haar ke baad siddhu kisi bhi tareeke kaa rajnatik bayaan nahin de rahe
 He is away from the media and is tweeting on social media
 navjot singh siddhu ne buudhvaar ko ek or twit kiya he
 In this tweet too, Sidhu wrote, "we feel sorry for being guilty, i am sorry, due to the greatness, we have brought Tashrif here, turn the mosque storm from our jurit, we have lit the lamp often even in the storms"
 
 bataa den, soshal media par log siddhu ke is twit ko apane-apane tareeke se kayaas laga rahe hai
 Sidhu was in the BJP in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections and replaced him with Amritsar by BJP, the current Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, although he was defeated by Captain Amarinder Singh in the election from here
 hamen mujrim naa yun samajhnaa, bada afsos hota he, With the help of Mahabdaulat, we have brought Tashreef here, palat dete hai mauje toofaan apni jurrat se, We have also often lit lamps in storms
 baad main, navjot singh siddhu kii naaraazgi ko dekhte hue bijepi ne unhen rajyasabha saansad banaaya
 However, he could not stay in the BJP for long and resigned and joined the Congress Party
 vidhansabha chunaav hue or punjab main congress kii sarkaar aane ke baad siddhu ko mantri banaaya gaya
 Since then, there have been some statements between the two Congress leaders for each other
 loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan navjot singh siddhu ke saath machi khinchataan ke bich punjab ke siem captain amarinder singh ne kaha tha ki agar rajya main congress chunaav haar jaati he to vah mukhyamantri ke pad se istipha de denge

" ham vartmaan mudde ke samaadhaan ke liye kaam kar rahe hai or ham yahaan pichley mudde ko lekar baithne ke liye nahin aae hai
 It is noteworthy that US Secretary of State John Carrie arrived in Delhi on Wednesday evening
 modi sarkaar ke satta main aane ke baad se yah pehla mauka he jab america videsh mantri bharat daure par hai
 Explain that after the new government came to power in India, there was a news in America that the US National Security Agency had spied the ruling party Bharatiya Janata Party and this agency was allowed by the US court
 is khabar ke saarvajanik hone ke baad bharat ne america rajdoot ko bulaakar is tarah kii ghatana kii punrariti na hone dene kii taakid kii thi
 Speaking on the issue, Carrie said he does not discuss intelligence agency talks in a public forum, as it does in other countries
 unhone kaha ki ham vah sab karenge jisase donon deshon ke bich behatar guptchar soochna kaa aadan-pradaan sambhav ho
 The US Secretary of State said that he is very excited about what attitude PM Modi takes

 We are seeing improvement in the relationship in a positive way

 But Sen disagrees with these ideas
 ''vigyaan kii khubsuurati, ham jo siddh kar sakate hai usase kahin zyada kalpana karne main he or string siddhant aapako brahmad kii bilkul alag vyakhya detaa he
 What is string theory? "one of the many questions that has always troubled human history is what are we and what is made of everything around us?" Modern science has described matter as one of its smallest pieces: molecules, atoms, electrons , By dividing it into protons, neutrons, quarks, etc
 string siddhant ke anusaar agar ham or bhi baariki main jaakar in kanon kaa pareekshan karen (jo ki philhal hamaari takneekee kshamta ke pare he) to ham paaenge ki antat ye padaarth ek chote, kampan karte loop se bane hai jo ki bahut zyada patale rabar band jaisaa hota he
 String theorists, based on mathematics, believe that the universe is made up of 10 dimensions, not three dimensions, as seen in everyday life

 In his words, "I used to think that our understanding of the world would not be complete until we have a theory that also applies to gravity
" '' unhen yah string siddhant main mil gaya
 "this gave rise to a new hope that this could be a theory which could be integrated with every fundamental force and which could be a decisive principle for nature

 madurai se saansad e venkatesh ne is silsile main maanav sansaadhan mantri ramesh pokharial nishank ko patr likhaa he
 Venkatesh, president of the Tamil Nadu Progressive Writers and Artists Association, wrote that the National Policy on Education (NEP) 2019 has been released
 nai shiksha niti hindi or angreji main 1 june se saarvajanik taur par uplabdh he or logon ko 30 june tak apni raay likhakar bhejne ko kaha gaya he
 a Venkatesh, seeking an extension of the response period, said that the National Education Policy of about 484 pages is not available in the languages of states including Tamil
 unhone kaha ki isse galat sandesh ja rahaa he ki keval hindi or angreji jaanane waalon se hi isko lekar pratikriya maangi ja rahi he jabaki jo hindi-angreji nahin jaanate hai unki andekhi kii ja rahi he
 Venkatesh said that the question was also why there was a delay in the submission of the report even though the committee had completed its work in December itself
 saansad ne kaha ki samiti ne 15 disambar 2018 ko report par hastakshkar kar die the jabaki maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantralay main ise jamaa karne ke liye use 31 may 2019 tak intjaar karnaa padaa

 You must have heard the story of Dasharatha Manjhi of Bihar, who built a road by breaking a mountain on her own
 kuch aisa hi udhaaharan ab chhattisgarh se dekhne ko mila he
 Shyam Lal single-handedly built a pond in Chirmari area of chori, Koriya district of Chhattisgarh
 unhone iske liye apane jivan ke 27 saal de die
 Actually, there was a shortage of water in the village of Shyam Lal
 lekin sarkaar ne is jarurat ko puraa nahin kiya
 There was no electricity nor water in this village
 tab 15 saal kii umr menshyam laal ne pani kii samasyako dur karne kii thaanee
 And now after 27 years of hard work, he also completed it
 talab banane ke baad ab yah naa sirf gaanv kii pani kii samasya ko dur kar rahaa he, balki machhlee pakadakar apni roji-roti kamaane vaale logon ke liye bhi madadgaar sabit ho rahaa he
 The one who blocked the way, he cut it: Dasaratha Manjhi's journey to become mountaineer in Gehlaur village near Gaya in Bihar is incomplete without mentioning his wife
 gahalor or aspataal ke bich khadey ziddee pahaad kii vajah se saal 1959 main unki bivi phalguni devi ko vakt par ilaaj nahin mil sakaa or wo chal bases
 Dasharatha Manjhi's journey started from here only
 22 saal kii mehnat:patni ke chale jane ke gam se toote dasharath maanjhi ne apni sari takat batori or pahaad ke seene par waar karne kaa faisla kiya
 But it was not easy
 shuruyaat main unhen pagal tak kaha gaya
 Dasharatha Manjhi had told, 'the villagers initially said that i have gone mad, but their taunts encouraged me further' amarnath yatra par neshnal green tribunel (engiti) ne spashtikaran jari kiya he
 The NGT has said that the order regarding Amarnath has been misreported
 tribunel ne apane spashtikaran main kaha he ki mantroccharan or aarti par kisi tarah kii roak nahin lagaai gai he
 Peace should be maintained only in front of Shivling
 iske saath hi gupha kii sidhiyon se pehle logon ko apana saamaan jamaa karnaa hoga
 And one has to walk in a line to enter the cave
 engiti ne saaf kiya he ki unhone amarnath gupha ko silent jone ghoshit nahin kiya he
 Some instructions have been given for the safety and comfort of bus pilgrims
 VHP ne bataaya hinduon kaa apmaanabta den ki buudhvaar ko engiti kii ore se nirdesh jari kiye jane ke baad vishwa hindu parishad ne ise hinduon kaa apmaan bataaya tha
 It also demanded the withdrawal of its order from the NGT
 bataa den ki amarnath yatra ke dauraan bhakt bhagwaan shiv ke jayakaare lagaate hue jate hai
 They also play bells in many places
 land slide (pathar girane) kii ghatnaon par roak lagane ke liye engiti ne yah kadam uthaaya gaya he
 Not only this, it has also been said to ban passengers' mobile phones
 vahiin engiti ne yah faisla sunaate hue kaha ki kuch mandiron main baat karne kii manaahi he or vahaan par silence jone he, jaise bahaai mandir, tirupati or akshardham main
 Land slide error due to sound in Amarnath whereas in Amarnath the risk of landslide increases due to sound
 aise main engiti ke anusaar paryaavaran kii drushti se behad samvedansheel hone or ilaake main glaciaron kii samvedansheeltaa ko dhyaan main rakhte hue yahaan shor-sharaaba nahin hona chahie or yatriyon kii sankhya bhi simit honi chahie
 Advocate Aditya Singhala, who petitioned the NGT, told Aaj Tak that the NGT has given this order in view of its ecological structure, so that the incidence of land sliding does not increase
 jab ek saath sainkadon log ghantia bajaate he yaa phir jayakaare lagaate he to vahaan ke paryaavaran ko nuksaan hota he
 NGT reprimands the Amarnath Board
 Let me tell you that last month the NGT reprimanded the Amarnath Shrine Board for not providing adequate infrastructure to the devotees and not submitting a status report in the matter in the first week of December
 amarnath shrin board ko fatkaar lagane ke baad hi engiti kii ore se ye aadesh jari kiya gaya he 
 The NGT said in the order that the Shrine Board should decide that people should go in the same line from the last check post to the Amarnath cave
 engiti ne kaha ki shrin board is baat kii vyavastha kare ki yatri apana saamaan surakshit rup se rakh sakebijapi netaa bagga ne di NGT ko chunautihalanki is faisle par vivaad bhi ho gaya he
 The BJP government termed this decision against the Hindus
 bijepi ke dilli pradesh ke pravaktaa tejinder paal bagga ne kaha ki vah amarnath yatra par jaaenge or bam bam bhole or har har mahadev kaa jayakaara lagaayenge
 If there is courage in NGT, stop them
 aapako bataa den ki isse pehle engiti ne aadesh jari karte hue mata vaishno devi main ek din main sirf 50 hajaar yatri hi darshan karne ke nirdesh die the
 Vaishno Devi Shrine Board had approached the Supreme Court against the order of the NGT
 jiske baad supreme court ne engiti ke aadesh par roak laga di thi

 Premium charges apply!! The BCCI has reacted strongly to the attitude of the Committee of Administrators (COA) on the issue, despite receiving positive signals from Head Coach Ravi Shastri over the proposed Day Night Test match against West Indies in October
 sioe pramukh vinod raay ke is maamle main unhen andhere main rakhane ke kaaran yah prastaavit match vivaad kaa vishay ban gaya he
 BCCI Acting Secretary Amitabh Chaudhary, CEO Rahul Johri and General Manager (cricket) Saba Karim were in touch with Shastri regarding the match
 shastri ne board se kaha ki kisi duusari shrenee kii team (westeindies) ke khilaaf is match kii mejabani kisi chote shahar main karnaa acha hoga, jisamen ek seshan dudhia roshni main khelaa jaae
 The game of cricket cannot go on without the T20: Gangulyrai expressed displeasure over the COA being ignored on the matter, when asked by a senior BCCI official about this

 club) on May 21, 2018 at 6:07 am PDT har kaam ke puraa hone ke baad praapt parinaam hamen us kaary ke bare main tarkpurna dhang se vichaar karke bhavishya ke liye vyaavhaarik kadam uthaane kaa ek anokhaa avasar uplabdh karaate hai
 The results of the last four years of the Civil Services Examination should be seen as an important factual opportunity
 civil seva ke abhi-abhi ghoshit parinaamon ke anusaar desh kii is sabase kathin evam sarvaadhik pratishthit akhil bhartiya pariksha main top karne vaale kanishka kataaria anusuchit jati se hai
 In the same exam of the year 2015, the twenty-two and a half year old Tina Dobby, who was topped, was also from this group of reservation
 nishchit rup se bharat in donon parinaamon ko aadhaar banaakar is baat par garv kar saktaa he ki usne saamaajik, saanskrithik or aarthik rup se pichde varg ko aarakshan dekar ab itnaa adhik shashakt bana diya he ki ve swatantra rup se kisi se bhi pratiyogita karke apni shreshthata siddh kar sakate hai
 Also, this has happened not only with men, but also with women
 meraa yah blog inhen parinaamon par vichaar karke bhavishya ke liye kuch nai nitiyon evam nai pahal karne par he
 Policies are in the hands of the government
 lekin pahal to vyaktigat str par bhi kii ja sakati he
 Apart from being a reservation class and topper, there are many other similarities between Tina and Kanishka that both of their fathers are in high government positions
 tina kii to maan bhi apane pati ke samakaksh hi thim
 That is, even though they were in reserved category on caste basis, both had gone far beyond the basis of that caste base
 tina kii padhai-likhaai jahaan dilli ke ek bahut shreshth college main hui, vahi kanishka iaiti mumbai ke student rahe
 Both were raised in good and well-equipped cities like Delhi and Jaipur
 in sabane unhen swaabhaavik rup se apane varg se upar uthaakar desh ke ek vishisht varg kaa sadsy bana diya
 Therefore, the use of the word 'reservation' for both of them is not only polluting the spirit of the word, but also insulting those who truly deserve it
 kyonki ve to aise nahin he
 i am saying this notwithstanding that i am legally wrong
 yah ek acha thos avasar he, jab desh kii sabhi pramukh raajnneetik partiyon ko ek saath baithkar is varg ke aarakshan ke prashn par baatcheet kerani chahie
 This conversation will not be on maintaining reservation or abolishing it, but on how to broaden its base and be practical
 iske liye unke paas anya pichhadaa varg krimilayer kaa udhaaharan pehle se maujuud hi he
 Otherwise, in the last 70 years, many such islands have also been built in these sections, whose fish will always have fish in their plates and that too, change the plates of people of their own class
 duusari baat he- vyaktigat str kii he
 Being the son of an officer, Kanishka would know very well the fact that the system cannot be changed by being part of the system
 yadi unhen vishwaas na ho, to ve apane hi shahar ke saal 2013 ke topper gaurav agarwal se puch sakate hai
 Gaurav Aggarwal expressed his disinterestedness in an article on his website after only three years of job
 yaa phir ve saal 2005 batch ke chhattisgarh coder ke iees o
 P
 choudhary se puch len, jinhen badlaav ke liye raajnneeti main janaa sahi laga
 Well, i have an appeal from Kanishka
 rajaneta jab karenge tab karenge
 You can do one thing for change, and that too immediately
 vah yah ki aap saarvajanik rup se kahen ki “main apane varg ke logon ke vyapak hit main yah ghoshnaa karata hoon ki meri aane vaali peedi aarakshan kaa laabh nahin legi
 "if your father had announced this, your career would not have made much difference
 vishwaas kijiye ki ab yadi aap aisa karenge, to aapke bacchon ke karier par bhi koi vipareet prabhaav nahin padegaa
 And with this, a new revolution can be started in the matter of reservation
 aap iske agua ban jaayenge
 This step of yours will be very beneficial for the society

 According to Skanda Purana, the evening time of the two sides of the month of each month is called 'pradosh' and Pradosh Vrat is kept on this day to please Shiva
 pradosh vrath kii puranic kathaskanda puraana main varnit ek katha ke anusaar pracheen kaal main ek vidhwaa brahmani apane putr ko lekar bhiksha lene jaati thi or sandhya ko lautati thi
 One day when she was returning with alms, she saw a beautiful boy on the banks of the river, who was the prince of Vidarbha Dharmagupta
 shatruon ne uske pita ko markar uskaa rajya hadap liya tha
 His mother's death was also famine
 brahmani ne us balak ko apana liya or uskaa paalan-poshan kiya
 After some time, Brahmin along with both the children went to Dev temple from Devyoga
 vahaan unki bhent rishi shandilya se hui
 Rishi Shandilya told Brahmani that the child they have got is the son of the king of Vidarbhashya who was killed in the war and his mother had cooked his food
 rishi shandilya ne brahmani ko pradosh vrath karne kii salaah di
 With the sage's orders, both the boys also started Pradosh fast
 ek din donon balak van main gum rahe the tabhi unhen kuch gandharva kanyaayein najar ai
 The Brahmin boy returned home but Prince Dharmagupta started talking to a Gandharva girl named 'anshumati'
 gandharva kanya or rajkumaar ek duusare par mohit ho gaye
 Kanya calls Rajkumar to introduce her father to the marriage
 duusare din jab vah pun: gandharva kanya se milane aayaa to gandharva kanya ke pita ne bataaya ki vah vidarbha desh kaa rajkumaar he
 On the orders of Lord Shiva, Gandharvaraja got his daughter married to Prince Dharmagupta
 iske baad rajkumaar dharmagupta ne gandharva sena kii sahaayta se vidarbha desh par punah aadhipaty praapt kiya
 All this was the result of fasting of Brahmin and Prince Dharmagupta
 skandapurana ke anusaar jo bhakt pradoshvrat ke din shivpuja ke baad ekagra hokar pradosh vrath katha sunata yaa padhata he use sau janmon tak kabhi daridrata nahin hoti
