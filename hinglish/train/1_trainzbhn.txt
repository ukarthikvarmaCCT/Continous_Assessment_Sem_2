 congress samet lagbhag sabhi rajnatik partiyaan in apradhi netaaon ko apane paale main laane ke prayaason main apane dhang se juty hui hai
 Two strong contenders for power - Lalu Prasad Yadav's Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and Chief Minister Nitish Kumar's Janata Dal (U) - seem to be at the forefront of the game
 agar nitish hatya ke doshi or purv saansad anand mohan ke paitruk awaas par 'saamaajik mulaakaat' ke liye gaye, jahaan anand mohan kii mata ne unhen aashirwad diya; to lalu prasad mohammad shahabuddin se milane ke liye siwan kii jail main hi pahunch gaye
 Both Lalu and Nitish are trying to fix the last minute equation to deal with organizational flaws and the decline in traditional support base
 unhone shatru kheme se daagi bahubali netaaon-prabhunath singh or purv kendriya mantri taslimuddin-ko apane kheme main laane main paryaapt lacheelepan kaa parichay diya he
 Although Lalu Prasad never took a stand against criminalization of politics, this change in the behavior of Nitish is truly shocking as he has always been a victim of clean politics
 aisa lagata he ki unhone is baat kii ore se apni ankhen pher lee hai ki rajnatik rup se uchit-anuchit kya he
 For example, the police have left independent MLA Pradeep Mahato of Warsaliganj open, while a warrant against him has been issued for several charges (including murder)
 warrant ke baavjood mahato ko nitish ke saath manch saajha karte dekha gaya he
 It is no wonder that Lalu Prasad is also in a hurry because lest Nitish clean his hands on any Bahubali before him
 anand mohan ke ghar tak nitish ke daure ke turant baad rajd ke pradhan mahasachiv or rajyasabha saansad ram kripal yadav jail main band purv saansad se 'raajnneeti par charchaa' karne ke liye do baar saharsa jail gaye
 Anand Mohan in 1994, Gopalganj District Magistrate
 krishnaiya kii sadak par kii gai hatya ke maamle main umrakaid kii sajaa kaat rahe hai
 With the implementation of this new brand of inclusive politics by the top players of politics in Bihar, it has surprised the good-ones
 aagaamee chunaav main lalu or nitish kaa bhagya kaaphi had tak daanv par laga hone ke kaaran donon hi ne apni ghabrahat jaahir kar di he
 While Lalu is trying his best to avoid drowning in this electoral disaster, Nitish tries to somehow drown him in it
 sambhawatah isiilie ye donon netaa bahubaliyon ko santusht karne kaa koi mauka chhodane ke mood main najar nahin aa rahe hai
 This clearly explains why Lalu and Nitish are trying to entertain Anand Mohan, while forgetting the fact that his wife Lovely Anand got only 81,479 votes in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections and was fourth on the Congress ticket from Shivhar
 She was agar is baar bhi aisa hi kuch hota he to yah vidhansabha chunaav ke liye kaaphi kargar rahegaa
 Unlike the Lok Sabha elections, the margin of victory in the assembly elections is quite small in proportionate ways
 1998 ke loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan bihar main 64
 The turnout was 6 percent
 ek saal baad matdaan kaa aankada 61
 Peaked at 48 percent
 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav main rajya ke 5
 Only 44 percent of the 44 crore voters exercised their franchise
 matdaan ke ghatate rujhaan ke kaaran bhi shaayad bahubaliyon kii puch ho gai he kyonki unase ummid kii jaati he ki ve kuch vot to dilava hi denge
 However, this argument may reveal the inclination of the leaders towards Bahubali towards Bihar, but their Bahubali cannot justify
 vastav main, shahabuddin, anand mohan, pappu yadav, surajbhaan or munna shukla bihar main bahubaliyon kii raajnneeti ke anya bahubaliyon se thodaa alag hai, vah isliye kyonki ve chunaav lard sakate hai lekin ye log nahin kyonki inke maamle main doshasiddhi ho chuki he
 He was also a gangster, being a leader of his caste as well as a contractor and public representative
 ve ek aise landscape main apni har bhoomika adaa karte the jahaan netaaon or aparaadhiyon ko vibhajit karne vaali rekha kaaphi pehle hi mit chuki thi
 It is no surprise that this Bahubali was a symbol of the ease through which they easily established their dominance in the politics of Bihar
 ye apane vibhinn mukhute pahane rakhane ke saath hi aparaadh or raajnneeti kaa bhi bakhubi mishran kar lete the
 Criminals like Anand Mohan and Shahabuddin are revered in the diverse and diverse groups of Bihar as heroes of caste or community
 samajashastri hetukar jha kehete hai, ''bihar main satta saz karne kii pramukh aharta hone ke alaava samarthan or aashray dene ke liye jati hameshaa se nirnaayak bhoomika adaa karti ai he
 Here, caste plays an important role in shaping political and ideological commitments
 '' chijen jitani badalati hai, utani hi ve yathaavat bhi rahati hai
 In Bihar, this is becoming more true than before
 kattarpathiyon ke aage jhuke imran Amitabh Bachchan aka Big B, who has earned fame in the world with his acting ability, believes that staying connected with his roots always proves helpful

 They believe that lessons learned from bad experiences always work in life
 unhone aage likhaa he, 'beete hue sunahare din, kathin samay or usase kis tarah paar paaya, asafalataaon kii niraashaa sabhi kuch vartmaan or aane vaale samay ke liye mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaate hai
 It is better to remember the experience so far and start anew

 com / mqmsiyl4jm — BCCI (@BCCI) October 29, 2017 putr kaa kartavya tabhi sarthak mana jaataa he, jab vah apane jeevankaal main mata-pita kii seva kare or unke maranoparant unki mrityutithi (barsi) tathaa mahalaya (pitrupaksh) main vidhivat shraadh kare
 This year, the fortnight of Shraddh (pitrupaksha) starts from September 9
 shraadh kii mul kalpana vaidic darshan ke karmwaad or punarjanmavaad par aadhaarit he
 It has been said that the soul is immortal, which is not destroyed
 shraadh kaa arth apane devataaon, pitaron or vansh ke prati shraddha prakat karnaa hota he
 It is believed that those who leave their bodies, be it in any world or in any form, come to earth in the Shraddha fortnight and are satisfied with Shraddha and Tarnad
 hindu manyataon ke anusaar, pindadaan moksh prapti kaa ek sahaj or saral maarg he
 In this way Pinddaan is done in many places of the country, but Pinddaan is very important in Gaya, situated on the Falgu coast of Bihar
 kaha jaataa he ki bhagwaan ram or devi sita ne bhi raja dasharath kii aatma kii shanti ke liye gaya main hi pindadaan kiya tha
 It is written in the Mahabharata that by taking a bath in the Phalgu Tirtha, a person who sees Lord Gadadhar (lord Vishnu) in Shraddhapaksha is freed from the debt of the ancestors
 kaha gaya he ki phalgu shraadh main pindadaan, tarpan or brahman bhojan-ye teen mukhya kaary hote hai
 The rituals and laws of ritual are different in Pitrupaksha
 shraddhalu ek din, teen din, saat din, pandrah din or 17 din kaa karmkand karte hai
 Gaya is considered the city of Vishnu
 yah moksh kii bhoomi kehalaati he
 It is also discussed in Vishnu Purana and Vayu Purana
 vishnu puraana ke mutabik, gaya main pindadaan karne se purvajon ko moksh mil jaataa he or ve swarg main vaas karte hai
 Vishnu himself is believed to be present as the ancestral deity here, hence it is also known as the 'pitru Tirtha'
 gaya ke panda devvrat ne bataaya ki phalgu nadi ke tat par pindadaan kiye bina pindadaan ho hi nahin saktaa
 The process of pindadan starts from the banks of the Punpun River
 kinvadantiyon ke anusaar, bhasmasur ke vanshaj main gayasur naamak rakshas ne kathin tapasya kar brahma se vardaan maanga tha ki uskaa sharir devataaon kii tarah pavitra ho jaae or log uske darshan maatr se paap mukt ho jaaen
 He got this boon, but the bad effect was that the population of heaven started increasing and everything started to be contrary to the natural law, because people started sinning without fear and sin was freed from the philosophy of Gayaasur
 isse bachane ke liye devataaon ne yajna ke liye pavitra sthal kii maang gayasur se kii
 Gaiasur gave his body to the gods for the yajna
 daitya gayasur jab leta to uskaa sharir paanch kos main fail gaya
 This is what was said in place of five Kos
 gayasur ke man se magar logon ko paap mukt karne kii ichha nahin gai or usne devataaon se phir vardaan maanga ki yah sthaan logon ko taarane vaala bana rahe
 Whatever fathers offer here, their fathers should be liberated
 yahi kaaran he ki aaj bhi log apane pitaron ko taarane yani pindadaan ke liye gaya aate hai
 According to scholars, the circular form of an object is called a body
 pratikatmak rup main sharir ko bhi pind kaha jaataa he
 The material to be offered to the deceased at the time of the pindadan, in which the spherulis made by kneading barley or rice flour is called pind dakshinabhimukh hokar, aachman kar apane janeu ko daaen kandhe par rakhkar chaaval, gaay ke doodh, ghi, shakkar evam shahad ko milakar bane pindon ko shraddha bhav ke saath apane pitaron ko arpit karnaa pindadaan kehalaata he
 Black sesame, barley, kusha and white flowers were mixed together in the water and they were offered in a ceremonial manner
 manyata he ki isse pitar trupt hote hai
 After this, the Brahmin is served food after the Shraddha
 pandon ke mutabik, shastron main pitaron kaa sthaan bahut ooncha bataaya gaya he
 The ancestral category includes all the ancestors including deceased mother, father, grandfather, grandmother, maternal grandfather, grandmother
 vyapak drushti se mrit guru or acharya bhi pitaron kii shrenee main aate hai
 Gaya is said to have previously had 360 altars of various names where Pindadan was performed
 inamen se ab 48 hi bachi hai
 However many religious institutions are demanding the discovery of those old altars
 is samay inhen 48 vediyon par log pitaron kaa tarpan or pindadaan karte hai
 It is considered important to offer Vishnupad temple in the altars here, on the banks of river Phalgu and under the syllabus
 ullekhneey he ki desh main shraadh ke liye haridwar, gangasagar, jagannathpuri, kurukshetra, chitrakoot, pushkar, badrinaath sahit 55 sthanon ko mahatvapurn mana gaya he
 The place of Gaya has been said to be paramount
 garud puraana main kaha gaya he ki gaya jane ke liye ghar se nikalne par chalane vaale ek-ek kadam pitaron ke swargarohan ke liye ek-ek seedhi banaate hai
 The ascetics perform their Shraddha in their lifetime
 garud puraana or matsay puraana main varnit he ki shraddha se arpit vasteen pitaron ko us lok main praapt hoti hai, jisamen ve rahete hai
 People also take out portions for crows, dogs and cows during the Shraddh
 manyata he ki kutta or kauwa yama ke kareebi hai or gaay baitarani paar karaati he

 On 7 June 2002, two films based on the life of freedom fighter Bhagat Singh hit the box office
 ek to ajay devgan starer or rajkumaar santoshi dwaara nirdeshit ek da lijend of bhagat singh thi

 ab 7 november ko neshnal aword vinar ayushmaan khurana kii film bala or 8 november ko sani singh kii ujadaa chaman screen par hit hone vaali hai
 Trailers and posters of both films have been revealed
 film kaa subject ek jaisaa he
 Both the stars are bald in the film
 aise main donon filmon main tulana hona laazmi he
 Both the films are being compared a lot on social media
 aaie jaanate hai donon filmon ke trailor main koun kis par padaa baari
 Storyline is the same subject of both films, but there is a slight difference in the storyline
 bala main ek taraf jahaan ayushmaan khurana apni pareshaani ke saath-saath ye bhi dikhaate hai ki isse unase jude baaki logon par bhi kya fark padataa he
 At the same time, Sunny Singh remained confined to himself
 bala main ayushmaan kii pareshaani ke saath or bhi muddon ko uthaaya gaya he
 Like only Gauri girls are needed
 jo gaura he vahiin sundar he
 The color of the film actress Bhumi Pednekar has also been shown as dark
 vahiin ujadaa chaman main sani kii pareshaaniyon par focus kiya gaya he
 Talking about lookalikes, the looks of both the stars are almost the same
 donon hi film main ganje bane hai
 Sunny Singh's look is very spectacular in the film
 unka luk ekadam real sa lagata he
 At the same time, Ayushmann also appeared quite invasive in his character
 starpavarstarapavar kii baat karen to jaahir si baat he ayushmaan khurana sani singh se kahi zyada aage hai
 Ayushman Khurana has also won the National Award
 iske alaava wo andhaadhun, dream girl or badhai ho jaisi kai hit filmein de chuke hai
 At the same time, this is Sunny Singh's first film in which he is going to be seen in the lead role
 isse pehle wo sonu ke titu kii sweety, pyaar kaa panchnaama jaisi filmein kar chuke hai
 The films were also a hit but he was not in the lead role in the film
 is maamle main ayushmaan khurana sani singh par baari hai
 Castbala's Starcast is much stronger than Ujra Chaman
 film main ayushmaan ke alaava bhoomi pednekar, yami gautam, javed jaafaree seemaa paahwa mukhya bhoomika main hai
 Apart from Sunny Singh, Manvi Gagaru, Karisma Sharma are there in Ujra Chaman

 may 2016 main bharat, iran va afghanistan ke bich hue ''parivahan va pargaman" samjhaute ke puraa hone ke baad chabahaar bandargah ke jariye afghanistan ko bheje jane vaale bhartiya gehun kii pehali khep ko ravaanaa kiye jane ke maukey par haal hi main hua samaaroh khaasaa mahatvapurn tha or sambhaavnaaon se bharaa bhi
 The indo-afghanistan Air Freight Corridor was also started shortly in June this year
 1947 main bharat ke vibhaajan ke kaaran pashchim kii taraf ke deshon ke saath hamaare kai ve vyapaar va pargaman raste band ho gaye jinka istemaal sadiyon se ho rahaa tha
 This loss was not felt immediately because our foreign trade was very small in volume and the national borders were very restrictive all over the world
 sheet yuddh ke baad ke daur main is sthiti main badlaav aayaa
 In a constantly globalizing world, the imperative of better connectivity between an area and between regions began to be felt
 hamaari niryaat kshamtaayen badhin, madhya asia ke taaja-taaja aaazaad hue deshon se sampark badhaane kii jarurat bani or talibani shashan ke khatm ho jane ke baad afghanistan main hamaari vaapasi ek mahatvapurn vyapaarik va aarthik sahyogi ke bataur hui
 All this also seemed that our transit routes towards the west should be restored
 lekin apana cheharaa bachaane ke liye apni naak kataane ke ek adarsh udhaaharan ke taur par pakistan ne bharat ke saath khaase lubhaavne vyapaar va pargaman samparkon ke liye manaa karnaa or yahaan tak ki unamem adangha lagaana jari rakhaa—dwipaksheeya str par or saarc ke dhaanche tale bhi
 This attitude is also in line with his policy in which he does not see any role in Afghanistan for India so that he can dominate the country
 madhya asia main hamaari pahunch banane ke sandarbh main iran ko pargaman raste ke taur par istemaal karne kaa khyaal sabase pehle 1990 ke dashak main paidaa hua tha
 The case of using the Chabahar port to reach Afghanistan and beyond has been involved in stalled negotiations since 2003 but could not make much progress because the US had imposed sanctions against Iran
 phir iran parmaanu samjhaute ne sthiti main badlaav kiya or uske parinamswaroop 2016 main tripaksheeya samjhaute par dastakhat kiye gaye
 This included permission to use the Chabahar port as well as a commitment by India to invest $ 500 million to develop the port and associated infrastructure facilities
 yah bandargah irani sadak network ke jariye nimrooj praant main simavarti afgaan shahar jaranj se judaa he

 ke kharch or talibani hamalon main bhartiya va afgaan suraksha balon kii jaan ke rup main hamane badi keemat adaa kii thi
 The road was handed over to Afghanistan in 2009 and connects via the Garland (mala) highway connecting major Afghan cities
 is prishthbhumi main pakistan or afghanistan, madhya asia va usase aage (rus va europe tak ko jodgaye vaale) pargaman raste ko viksit na karne dene kii uski adoordarshee hathdharmita ko darkinar karne kii hamaari koshish main gehun kii khep ek mahatvapurn uplabdhi he
 However, there may be some uncertainties in this path
 pehali baat, yah jaruri hoga ki bandargah ke vikaas kii pariyojna ko samay se puraa kar liya jaae or nirbaadh pargaman prakriya khadi kar lee jaae
 Any process laden with administrative bottlenecks will take away the advantages of shorter transit routes than the rest of the long but efficient transit routes
 duusari baat, is raste kaa istemaal iran va afghanistan par nirbhar karegaa
 As our dependence increases, Iran will want to use its geographical advantage in the context of overall relations with us
 haalanki ek sakriy bandargah ke aakarshan or hamaari kaabil kootneeti ke chalate is pahalu ko nibata liya janaa chahie
 Then, due to the fragile situation in Afghanistan, the proposed transit route may face similar threats as the china-pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) of China is facing in Pakistan
 chintaa kii ek or baat america raashtrapati donald trump kaa is baat ko pramanit na karne kaa faisla he ki iran parmaanu samjhaute kii sabhi sharton kaa paalan kar rahaa he

 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne gat 8 november ko 500 or ek hajaar rupee ke noton ko band kar diya or kaha ki yah bhrashtachar, kalaadhan or aatankwaad ke vitt poshan ke khilaaf ek abhiyaan he
 Despite Modi and Shah's constant pleas to go to the public and publicize this good decision by the government, mps and local leaders are not willing to face public outrage over the endless cash shortage
 party ke ek saansad ne khulkar sweekaar kiya, "main maar khaanaa nahin chahta hum

 ) alag-alag partiyon kii ore se mahilaon ko raajnneeti main zyada se zyada laane kii baat, unhen aage badhaane ke daawey aaj ke nahin saalon se kiye ja rahe hai
 But are women getting the place in politics, the respect, the responsibility that they are entitled to and for which they are fully capable? There are hollow claims to bring women forward in politics
 The claims are hollow
 agar kaha jaae dilli kii raajnneeti kaaphi had tak desh kii raajnneeti kaa aaina he to galat nahin hoga
 Looking at this mirror, it is known that women are constantly being ignored in Delhi's politics
 aankde bataate hai ki dilli kii vidhansabha main is samay mahilaon kii bhagidaari keval 4
 28 percent and more embarrassing is that even 20 years ago, their percentage in the assembly was the same
 mahilaayein har chunauti ko maat detii aage bad raheen hai, lekin maat kha rahi hai raajnneeti kii bisaat par
 This is the bitter truth of Delhi politics
 70 sadasyon kii dilli vidhansabha main is samay mahilaon kii sankhya keval 3 he
 Every time there are strong claims of giving tickets to women in politics, but if you look at the figures of women in the last 4 assemblies, the reality will automatically be understood
 aankade bataate hai ki
 
 
 - The 1993 Delhi Legislative Assembly had 3 women elected
 varsh 1998 main sabase jchada 9 mahilaayein vidhansabha pahunchi or 70 sadasyon kii team main inkaa pratishat lagbhag 13 tha, lekin varsh 2003 main jahaan 7 mahilaon ko vidhansabha main aane kaa mauka mila, vahiin varsh 2008 kii essembly yani abhi kii essembly main mahilaon kii sankhya maatr 3 rah gai he
 That is, where women stood in politics in the last 20 years, they still stand there
 dilli vidhansabha ke purv sachiv es ke sharma ke anusaar ye baat to bilkul sach he ki koi bhi party mahilaon ko aage aane kaa mauka hi nahin de rahi he
 Former Duta member Neetu Verma also says that even today politics is male dominated and women are given less opportunities to come forward
 ajeeb vidambnaa he ye
 
 
 By the way, it is a strange irony that despite the Delhi state command which has been in the hands of a woman ie Sheela Dixit for the last 15 years, women are not getting a chance to enter politics
 purv duuta adhyaksh alka lamba kahati hai ki unhen raajnneeti main aae 18 saal kaa lanbaa samay ho gaya he aage badhane kaa mauka hi nahin mil rahaa
 Today neither there is a place for me in politics nor in any other profession, i am able to fit myself
 jahaan tak 1993 se lekar 2008 se shuru hui chauthi vidhansabha kii baat karen to congress ke mukaable bijepi kii halaat zyada kharaab lagate hai
 In 1993, BJP came to power and one of its leaders Purnima Sethi reached the assembly, after that since 1998 till now, in 15 years, in three assemblies, BJP sat in opposition and none of their women leaders were in opposition
 matlab unki koi bhi mahila vidhansabha nahin pahunchi
 BJP leader Dr
 harshavardhan is baat ko maanate hai or is par safai bhi dete hai ki kai kaarnon se aisa ho jaataa he, vaise party to mahilaon ko har str par badhaava de rahi he
 Only a few women in politics 'dhamak' In the politics of the country, few women leaders like Sonia Gandhi, Mamta Banerjee, Sheela Dixit, Jayalalithaa are glowing, but they are not the real picture of politics, every party still gives more women Talks about giving more tickets than lekin jab chunaav saamne hote hai to unki kathani or kerani main fark saaf pataa chalata he
 Congress leader Digvijay Singh has said that the time has come when Rahul Gandhi should take charge of the Congress
 angreji akhbaar economic times ko die intervyuu main digvijay singh ne kaha he ki sonia gandhi ko ab maardarshak kii bhoomika main aa janaa chahie or rahul gandhi ko congress adhyaksh ban janaa chahie
 Digvijay said, Congress party has always given opportunity to young people, so i am saying that Rahul Gandhi should take full charge of Congress now and Sonia ji's leadership will remain
 
 
 digvijay ke mutabik rahul gandhi ko zyada se zyada logon tak apni pahunch banani hogi or iske liye vah bharat yatra par nikalen
 At the same time, Congress leader Makhan Lal Fotedar has retaliated on this statement of Digvijay Singh
 photedaar ne kaha he ki digvijay khud bada netaa bananaa chaahate hai, isliye aise bayaan de rahe hai
 In this case, BJP leader Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi has also taken a dig at Digvijay Singh
 pai, adhela or duanni, ek paisa, do paise, paanch paise, das paise or 20 paise ke baad ab chavanni bhi aaj se itihaas main samaa gayi
 Chavanni was not only a coin of metal, but was also a witness in our history who saw many ups and downs in time
 san 1919, 1920 or 1921 main george pancham ke samay khaas chavanni banaayi gayi thi
 Its form was kept octagonal, not keeping the traditional round shape
 yah chavanni nikal dhaatu se taiyaar hui thi lekin yah khaas aakaar logon ko lubhaa nahin paaya
 According to the historians, this was the first such quarter that was not round in shape
 itihaaskaar bataate hai ki mashin se bani chavanni pehali baar 1835 main chalan main aayi
 It was issued in the name of William IV of the East India Company
 tab yah chaandi kii hua karti thi
 Sreebhagwan, a 67-year-old elder who is fond of collecting old coins, said that the chawnis which came up to 1940 remained completely silver but after that the period of adulteration started and between 1942 and 1945 half silver chawni was introduced in the market
 lekin uske baad 1946 se nikal kii chavanni chalan main aayi
 On one side of Nickel's Chavanni was a portrait of George VI and the Indian Tiger on the other side

 It was also called barter system
 lekin vastu vinimay main aane vaali dikkaton ko dekhte hue mudra kii jarurat mahasoos hui jiske nirdhaarit mulya par koi bhi cheez kharidi yaa bechi ja sake
 In this way coinage in the form of currency came into existence

 Sher Shah 11
 4 gram ke chaandi ke sikke kii shuruuaat kii thi jise chaandi kaa rupi bhi kaha gaya
 Actually the word rupee came out in the Sanskrit meaning of silver
 mughal samrajya ne bhi shershah dwaara shuru tantra ko hi aage badhaayaa
 Jahangir was particularly fond of coins among the Mughal emperors
 badshaah jahangir ne kuch samay ke liye raashi chakree sone or chaandi ke sikke chalaae
 Not only this, the world's largest 12 kg gold coin was also made during this period
 rigerv bank sutron ne bataaya ki 31 march 2010 tak bazaar main pachaas paise se kam mulya vaale kul 54 arab 73 karod 80 lakh sikke prachlan main the, jinaki kul keemat 1,455 karod rupee mulya ke baraabar hai
 This amounts to 54 percent of the total coins prevalent in the market
 haalanki, mudrasphiti kii badhati dar ke kaaran bazaar main 25 paise kaa sikaa prachlan main kaaphi samay pehle se hi band he or aamtaur par dukandaar athwa graahak len-dein main iskaa prayog nahin karte hai
 According to informed sources, the metal value of the 25 paise coin costs more
 arthshaastra kii bhashaa main ise sikke kii dhalaai kaa nakaaratmak hona kaha jaataa he
 Initially it was worth more than its cost
 dhaatu or ankit mulya ke bich kaa yah antar hi sarkaar kaa phayda hota he, lekin ankit mulya kam or dhaatu mulya adhik hone se yah nuksaandaayak ho jaataa he
 It is noteworthy that copper, nickel, zinc and stainless steel are mainly used in coin making
 vaishvik bazaar main in pramukh dhaatuon kii keemton main badhotaree ke kaaran adhiktar desh kam mulya vaale sikke banane se kataraane lage hai
 Amid the allegations of a series of scams ahead of the Commonwealth Games, former India hockey captain Ashok Kumar today said that the country is not ready to host such a big event

 bharat sarkaar ke khanan mantralay ke sachiv kaa tabadalaa in dinon charchaa main he
 The reason for this is the Justice MB Shah Commission report on the illegal iron mining scam in Goa
 khanan rajya mantri ne is report ko tay samay seemaa ke andar sansad main pesh kar diya or iskaa khamiyaaza bhugatna padaa khanan sachiv ko
 Questions are arising as to why the mining secretary was punished
 kya isliye, kyonki ye report congress shashan ke dauraan hue 35 hazaar karod rupee ke ghotaale kaa pardaafash karti he?sarkaar ke gusse kaa shikaar hue trivedi1977 batch ke iees adhikari or khanan sachiv rahe vishwapati trivedi sarkaar ke gusse kaa shikaar ho gaye
 Angry that the Minister of State for Mining presented the Justice MB Shah Commission report on the mining scam in Goa directly in Parliament on 7 September
 report pesh hote hi cabinet sachivalay main sanyukt sachiv alok chaturvedi ne 14 sitambar ko vishwapati trivedi ko ek kaaran bataao notice bheja
 In the notice, Vishwapati Trivedi was asked how the report reached the Parliament directly
 notice ke mutabik report cabinet ke zarie sansad main pesh honi chahie
 Why was it not done? He was shown the way out before the mining secretary responded to this notice
 darasal niyamon ke mutabik kisi bhi jaanch kamishan kii report 6 maheene ke bheetar cabinet ke zarie sansad main pesh honi chahie
 After all, what is the reason that this report did not go to the government and reached the Parliament directly
 35000 karod ke gaban kaa hua khulasagauratlab he ki justise shah kamishan report main congress shashan ke dauraan goa main avaidh khanan ke 35000 karod ke gaban kaa khulaasa hua he
 The report directly questions former Congress chief minister Digambar Kamat
 jis dauraan ye ghotaalaa hua, us vakt digambar kaamat hi goa ke mukhyamantri the or 12 saal tak khanan mantralay bhi unheen ke paas rahaa
 Is this not the reason that this report kept licking dust in the Ministry of Mining for 6 months
 or niyamon ke tahat jab khanan rajya mantri ne is report ko sidhe sansad main pesh kar diya to khanan sachiv se sawaal jawaab kyon
 On the other hand, the opposition also targeted the matter
 paryaavaran mantralay bhi sawaalon ke ghere menkolgate kaa aarope jhel rahi upie sarkaar is jaal se nikal paati isse pehle hi khanan sachiv ke tabadale ne sarkaar kii manshaa par phir sawaal khadey kar die hai
 The Shah Commission report also questioned the environment ministry
 report main saaf taur par kaha gaya he ki paryaavaran mantralay ne goa main khanan kii anumati kanoon ko pare rakh kar di he
 It has also been said in the report that whether it is a minister or an officer, whoever has done illegal work, action should be taken according to the law
 gaur karne vaali baat ye he ki us dauraan paryaavaran mantralay kaa kaarybhaar pradhanmantri khud dekh rahe the
 It is obvious that the government will now have to present its own cleanliness to the opposition on another front
 sieji kii report ho yaa phir kamishan kii jaanch report ek ke baad ek pichley dinon main saamne ai in reporton ne sarkaar ke kaam karne ke tareeke or inke mantriyon kii manshaa par gambhir sawaal khadey kiye hai
 The government may argue that it is not obliged to accept the commission's report, but the government will have to answer the questions raised in this report

 yah baat salmaan ko kaaphi buree lagi thi
 Salman has also mentioned in many of his interviews that he has ignited a person who does not respect him and his family at Sonam Kapoor's reception party
 haalanki salmaan ne kabhi sidhe taur par rishi kapur kaa naam nahin liya
 However, how much the new reports claim is correct, it will be known only after Rishi Kapoor returned from New York
 jharkhand ke ek or jawan ne desh ke liye apane praanon kii aahuti de di
 The sergeant in the army, Francis Horo, died during the patrolling in Jammu
 shanivaar raat unka parthiv sharir ranchi laayaa gaya
 On Sunday, his last rites were performed with full state honors at Lali village in Sidraul area of ranchi

 The martyred Horo leaves behind him two daughters, besides an old mother and wife
 ek beti 13 saal kii he or ek 8 saal kii
 Martyred Francis Horow joined the Army in 1995
 bihar regiment main hawaldaar ke pad par karyrat horo us samay cross firing kaa shikaar ho gaye
 While they were patrolling the border
 bataa den, seemaa par chal rahe maujuuda tanaav or golibari main ab tak jharkhand ke teen sapooton ne shahadat di he
 Apart from Francis Horok, the suicide attack in Uri has killed Nayman Kujur of Gumla and Javra Munda of Khunti
 ab koi unki tulana australian khabbu wicket-keeper adam gilcrist se karne laga he to koi unhen bhavishya kaa mahendra singh dhoni bataa rahaa he
 Now in front of the glare of Pant's batting, the matter of relatively loose wicket keeping has been suppressed
 unki tulana adam gilcrist se isliye bhi kii ja rahi he kyonki donon ke ballebaaji kaa mizaaj bhi takreeban ek jaisaa he, donon aakraamak or joardaar shot khelte hai or donon hi khabbu bhi hai
 At the moment, Pant has scored 673 points in the ICC Test ranking, the highest ranking among Indian wicketkeeper batsmen
 unase pehle khud dhoni hi is kursii par kabiz the jinhen 662 ank mili the
 The players of the Indian team, who created a history of defeating Australia by sneaking into their home, have also benefited from their performance in the ICC Test rankings
 or pant isisi test ranking main ab 17wein paaydaan par pahunch chuke hai
 Pant was ranked 59th in the Test rankings before the start of the tour
 match dar match unki ranking main phayda hua or unhone 17wein paaydaan par pahunchakar farrukh ejeeniyar kii barabari kar lee
 Prior to Pant, the engineer achieved the 17th ranking in January 1973
 haalanki dhoni shandaar finishar the par unka asli jalawaa ekadivasiy maichon main dikhataa tha
 Dhoni had never reached the 17th position in Test ranking
 kariyar ke shikhar dinon main dhoni ko sarvocch 19veen rekking hi hasil ho pai thi
 Before the tour of Australia, Pant had played only 5 Test matches
 lekin pataal lok main 4 match khilne ke baad aisa lagata he pant lambey samay tak jalawaafarosh rahenge
 Pant made a total of 350 runs in Australia tour, remained unbeaten in 159 innings in an innings and also took 20 catches
 australia main test shatak jadne vaale pant pehle bhartiya wicket-keeper hai
 Prior to this, Farooq Engineer had scored his highest 89 runs in Adilate in 1967
 isse pehle 2018 main pant ne ek or aisa hi karnama kiya tha
 He also became the first Indian wicket-keeper to score a century on England soil last year
 vaise kisi bhartiya wicket-keeper se sarvocch score se pant abhi bhi thode peeche hai or is kursii par abhi bhi dhoni kabiz hai
 Dhoni has the longest innings as a wicket-keeper
 unka sarvocch score 224 tha jabaki duusare paaydaan par buddhi kundaran hai jinhone 192 kaa score khadaa kiya tha
 The highest score of any guest wicket-keeper on Australian soil is AB de Villiers, who scored 169 runs in Waka in 2012-13
 jaahir he, pant ab duusare number par hai
 By the way, in batting at number seven in Australia, Pant has also come second
 isse pehle ke
 s
 ranjitsinghji ne esasiji ke maidan par 1897 main 175 ran bana daale the
 Pant and Ravindra Jadeja shared a 204-run partnership for the seventh wicket, the longest of any wicket partnership in Australia
 isse pehle 1983-84 main emsiji main greg mathew or graham yalop ne pakistan ke khilaaf 185 ran kaa saajhedaari kii thi
 In terms of India, this is the second largest partnership for the seventh wicket on foreign soil
 vaise pant 21 saal kii umr main do test centuri banane vaale, wo bhi donon ke donon asia se baahar, pehle wicketiper he
 In spite of these achievements, there is still some haste in Pant's shot selection
 test match main, haalanki score board ab unhen zyada sthir bataa rahaa he, lekin ab bhi uttardaayitv se bhari paariyaan unka intjaar kar rahi hai
 Aggression is his batting mood
 par har wicket par yah kaamyaab hi hoga, aisa kahana thik nahin hoga
 In any case, there is a difference between haste and aggression, exactly what happens in irresponsibility and determination to set floors

 assam main skool course main shamilkitabamengujratdangon ko lekar pradhanmantri narendramodiko lekar likhi gai tippanee ke maamle main police ne cese darj kar liya he
 An FIR has been registered against the three authors of the book in this case
 raajnneeti vigyaan kii yah kitaab 12veen class ke chaatro ko padhai jaati he, jo asamiya bhashaa main likhi gai he
 The book has been running since 2011, whose page number 376 states that in 2002 when riots were taking place in Gujarat, the bogie of the Sabarmati Express was set on fire at the Godhra station which killed 57 people when the then CM Narendra Modi was silent
 yah kitaab teen logon ne likhi he, jisamen durga kanta sharma, rafique jamaan or maanas protim barua shaamil hai
 However, Durga Kanta Sharma died a few years ago
 is kitaab main siem modi kii bhoomika par likhe gaye chapter ke khilaaf saumitra goswami or maanav jyoti bora ne exiaar darj karai he
 People who have lodged the FIR have alleged that the author and publisher's Assumption Depot acted to mislead students by giving false information on the Godhra riots

 CPM leader Sitaram Yechury claimed that there were positive indications on Jayalalithaa and Naveen Patnaik's participation in the conference
 kyunki ye sammelan teesraa morcha banane ke liye nahin balki desh kii ekta banaaye rakhane ke liye bulaayaa gaya he
 Although the Left parties and the Samajwadi Party are refusing to name it as the Third Front, but before the elections these exercises appear to be a growing step in the same direction

 Now Akhilesh Yadav's uncle Shivpal Yadav has announced to form a new party on 11 March
 itawa main unhone mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ko sarkaar banaakar dikhaane kii chunauti di
 'seats higher than Congress status' Shivpal Yadav also questioned the party's alliance with the Congress
 unka kahana tha ki rajya main congress kii 4 siten jeetne kii haisiyat bhi nahin he
 In such a situation, giving 105 to the party will frustrate the party workers
 unhone bataaya ki wo 19 farvari ke baad aisi siton par prachaar karenge jahaan se mulaayam singh yadav ke samarthak chunaav lard rahe hai
 Shivpal Yadav reiterated that he cannot tolerate Netaji's insult at any cost and will support him till his death
 akhilesh yadav par nishananamakan bharne ke baad samarthakon ko sambodhit karte hue shivpal yadav bhavuk ho gaye
 Yadav alleged that his stature was being deliberately reduced within the party
 mukhyamantri ko ishaaron hi ishaaron main nishane par lete hue shivpal yadav ne kaha ki netaji kii vajah se apana vajood bataane vaale hi aaj unhen apamaanit kar rahe hai
 Shivpal Yadav said that he had told Akhilesh Yadav that even if he is not contested, Mulayam Singh Yadav should be allowed to be the national president of the party
 lekin akhilesh yadav ko ye manjuur nahin tha
 On this occasion, Shivpal Yadav also counted his achievements as a minister
 unhone yaad dilaayaa ki kai ahm mahakme sanbhaalane ke baavjood unpar koi aarope nahin laga
 Taking credit for road construction during his tenure, Shivpal Yadav claimed that many people tried to put pressure on him and in many cases his files were held for 2 years
 shivpal ke mutabik unhone sarkaar main galat kaamon ke khilaaf aawaaj uthaai or nakli sharaab ko banane se roka
 This was the reason that he was dismissed by the CM
 unki maane to siem ne acha kaam kar rahe ambika choudhary or naarad raay jaise mantriyon ko bhi hataane se gurej nahin kiya
 In Delhi, a young man was stabbed to death when he came to a warehouse to fill water
 katl karne ke liye hamalwaar ne us kai baar chaaku se waar kiye
 Police have taken the body and sent it for postmortem
 police ab maamle kii chaanbin kar rahi he
 This sensational murder is from the area of ghazipur

 He lived in Ghazipur with his family

 But Manoj did not return home after almost two hours
 jab bahut der ho gai to uski patni maukey par gai, jahaan manoj lahooluhaan haalat main jameen padaa tha
 Seeing this, his wife shouted and called people from outside and took them to the warehouse
 manoj ko is haalat main dekh kar log ghabara gaye
 Before they could understand anything, someone informed the police
 police ne maukey par pahunch kar shav ko kabje main le liya
 Police found that Manoj was murdered with a knife
 us par kai baar chaaku se waar kiye gaye the
 According to the police, the brutality with which Manoj has been killed

 On the other hand, the family members of the deceased say that Manoj worked there for many years
 roj vahaan pani bharne ke liye jaataa tha
 But why and who murdered him is not even understood by him
 police ne panchnaame kii karrwai ke baad shav ko postmortem ke liye bhej diya he

 Veteran Left leader Somnath Chatterjee has claimed that CPI (M) General Secretary Prakash Karat wanted to teach Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and UPA Chairperson Sonia Gandhi a lesson in 2008 by withdrawing support from the government after feeling humiliated over the nuclear deal issue
 loksabhaa ke purv adhyaksh somnath chatarji ne kaha he ki apni ‘prabhavi’ chhavi ke kaaran or 62 saansadon ke saath sarkaar par asar ke chalate karaat, bhakpa ke abi bardhan or anya vampanthi netaaon ko lagata tha ki sarkaar ke liye unka faisla antim shabdon kii tarah hoga
 Somnath recalled his last days as Speaker of the Lok Sabha in his autobiography 'keeping the Faith: Memories of a Parliament', which was released by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Saturday
 somnath ne likhaa he, ‘‘pradhanmantri ke rup main manmohan singh or adhyaksh ke rup main sonia gandhi ke saath samprag kii sarkaar banane ke baad sabhi ke liye, khaastaur par sarkaar ke logon ke liye dhire
 Gradually it became clear that the Left parties wanted to play the role of 'the real power behind the throne'
 vam dalon ke loksabhaa main 62 saansad the or baahar se unke samarthan par sarkaar kaa astitv tikaa tha
 He wrote that the party had maintained such a belief that the UPA government could only survive with the blessings of the party leaders, primarily its general secretary Prakash Karat
 81 varshiya somnath ke anusaar parmaanu qaraar karne kii congress kii dridhtaa ne karaat ko naaraaz kiya
 He wrote a chapter in the book 'the Exploration
 e great shock’ main likhaa he, ‘‘aisa lagata tha ki karaat ne faisla kar liya tha ki pradhanmantri or samprag adhyaksh ko unke hue apmaan ke liye sabak sikhaanaa he
 The former Lok Sabha speaker was expelled from the CPI-M in 2008, who has been a member of the Lok Sabha ten times
 unhone likhaa he ki sarkaar se samarthan vaapasi ke vam dalon ke faisle main unki koi bhoomika nahin thi
 According to the book published by harpercalins, "I think that he was so upset by what the Prime Minister and the UPA Chairperson considered an insult to Karat, that he did not know about the consequences of the decision to withdraw support from the government
" Could not think or think
 ’’ somnath ne kaha ki unka prastaav tha ki makapa ko parmaanu qaraar ke khilaaf saarvajanik vichaar jaanane ke liye kadam uthaane chahie haalanki unka vichaar party dwaara qaraar kaa virodh karte rahane kaa bhi tha
 Describing one of the most shocking incidents in the history of Lok Sabha (2004-09), Somnath has explained why he did not resign from the post of Lok Sabha Speaker even after the withdrawal of CPI (M) support from the Center
 unhone iske baad hue vishwaas mat kaa bhi zikr kiya he jisamen unhone sadan kii adhyakshata kii thi or party ne unke saath kya ravaiya apanaaya
 According to Somnath, Marxist veteran leader Jyoti Basu advised him to preside over the House in a vote of confidence as a speaker
 unhone likhaa he, ‘‘maine apane raajnneetik kariyar main jyoti basu se kaaphi kuch siikhaa he jo apane aakhri dinon tak mere nirvivaad netaa rahe
 i met him in Kolkata on 12 July 2008 and showed him the message from the party
 ’somnath ke mutabik, ‘‘jaahir he ki unhen qaraar par party kii sthiti bhaleebhanti pataa thi or maine unase is mudde par koi charchaa nahin kii
 But he advised me that i should preside over the proceedings of the House on a vote of confidence
 ’unhone likhaa he, ‘‘unhen lagata tha or main bhi yahi sochataa tha ki mere istife se aisa lagegaa ki main spikar ke taur par apane pad se samjhauta kar rahaa hum or meri party ko apni kaaryastylee par haaavee hone de rahaa hum jo puri tarah aniatik tha
 Somnath has also said that he had a premonition of disciplinary action by the party against him but never thought that all this would be done in such a hurry
