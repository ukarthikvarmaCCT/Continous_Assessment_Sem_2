 It is being told that under the bcci's rotation policy, the selectors have given rest to ashwin-jedja
 lekin in donon kaa baahar rahanaa phens ke bich surkhiyon main he
 Let's look at the facts that did not make much of a reshuffle in Team India

 bijepi ko punjab ke gurudaspur loksabhaa seat ke upachunaav main karaari haar mili he
 The defeat of Gurudaspur has given sleep to those who dream of victory in the name of Modi Magic
 bijepi ke durg kahe jane vaale gorakhpur or dipti CM keshav maury ke kshetra phulpur loksabhaa seat par upachunaav hone he
 Yogi's first agniksha is a challenge to retain both these seats
 jabaki vipaksh unhen gheraabandi karne kii puri taiyaari kar rakhi he
 In such a situation, it has to be seen that how Yogi and Keshav keep their strongholds by breaking the opposition's strategy? Actually, if the mathematics of Gorakhpur and Phulpur are seen, there has been a very interesting battle in both the parliamentary constituencies
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main jahaan bijepi ko in siton par sabhi vipakshi dalon ko mili kul voton se bhi zyada vot mili the
 But now that color has started to fade
 yahi vajah he ki bijepi ko donon siton par apana varchasv kaayam rakhana ek badi chunauti he
 Keshav has become conscious of the defeat of Gurudaspur in his attempt to save his stronghold
 yahi vajah he chunaav ayog ke elaan se pehle keshav maury apane garh ko majboot karne main lage hai, taaki phulpur seat kii jeet ko barkaraar rakh sake
 In this episode, he has given a strong blow to BSP
 ravivaar ko bispi ke teen purv vidhayakon ne bijepi kaa daaman tham liya
 These include the names of Neeraj Maurya, Guru Prasad Maurya and Deepak Patel
 deepak patel elahabaad kii karchana seat se vidhayak rahe to vahiin guru prasad maury fafamau se vidhayak rahe hai
 Kesari Devi, a four-time District Panchayat President from Allahabad, has also joined BJP
 iske alaava basapa se do baar shahjahanpur kii jalalabad vidhansabha seat se vidhayak rahe niraj maury ne bhi bijepi kii sadsyta grahan kii he
 If we talk about the Phulpur Phulpur Lok Sabha seat which was the seat of Nehru, then it has been the traditional seat of Congress
 desh ke pehle pradhanmantri jawaharlal nehru phulpur loksabhaa seat se chunaav ladate rahe hai or teen baar isi seat se chunakar loksabhaa pahunche
 bjp's first open accountbjp managed to win Phulpur Lok Sabha seat in Modi wave in 2014 for the first time
 keshav maury isi seat 2014 main loksabhaa chunaav jitkar saansad bane the, lekin upi ke dipti CM ban jane ke baad unhen istipha dena padaa
 Four times, SP won, SP also has strong support base in Phulpur seat
 yahi vajah he ki 1996 se lekar 2004 tak samaajawaadee party kaa ummidavaar lagaataar jeetta rahaa he
 Before that, the Janata Dal had won this seat twice, while the BSP had won in 2009
 aise main bijepi ke liye phulpur seat ko barkaraar rakhana sabase badi chunauti he
 The caste equation of Phulpur The caste equation in Phulpur is quite interesting
 is sansadeey kshetra main sabase zyada patel matadaata hai, jinaki sankhya kareeb sava do lakh he
 The number of Muslim, Yadav and Kayastha voters is also around this
 lagbhag dedh lakh brahman or ek lakh se adhik anusuchit jati ke matadaata hai
 SP is planning to field Patel candidate from here
 iske alaava pichley dinon is kshetra main kaddavar netaa indrajit saroj ne sapa kaa daaman thama he
 Gorakhpur, Gorakhpur is considered the traditional seat of BJP, hence Gorakhpur is called the fort of BJP
 mahant avaidhyanath ne 1989 main hindu mahasabha ke tikat par chunaav ke jeet kaa jo silsla shuru kiya, vah aaj bhi jari he
 Mahant Avaidyanath was a four-time MP from Gorakhpur, independent in 1970, Hindu Mahasabha in 1989, and again in 1991 and 1996 from BJP
 yogi paanch baar saansad banegorkhupar main mahant avaidhyanath kii raajnneetik viraasat ko yogi adityanath ne 1998 main sambhala to phir palatakar nahin dekha
 For the last five times, Yogi continued to reach Parliament on BJP ticket
 chaahe bispi kii soshal ejineering rahi ho yaa phir akhilesh kaa samaajwaad, kabhi unke saamne chunauti nahin ban sakaa or unke jeet kaa silsilaa lagaataar jari rahaa
 It is not easy for the opposition to win in Gorakhpur, Gorakhpur Lok Sabha seat has become vacant after Yogi became UP CM in March 2017
 aise main yogi ke saamne bijepi ke durg ko bachaane ke liye agniparikshaw se guzarana hoga
 According to the Gorakhpur Lok Sabha seat 2014, there were a total of 10,40,199 votes out of which Yogi got 5,39,127 votes, on the other hand SP got 2,26,344 votes, BSP got 1,76, 412 and Congress 45,719 votes
 aise main yogi ko akele hi in teenon party se zyada vot mila tha
 In this way, it will not be easy for the opposition to break into the fort of Yogi

 shampoo karne ke baad phir se saaf pani se bal dhoen
 Do not rub the shampoo on your hair repeatedly if you want to remove the frozen colors on the hair quickly, as it may take some time to clear the color accumulated on the hair
 holi ke rangon ko baalo se hataane ke liye baby shampoo yaa natural shampoo kaa istemaal kar sakate hai
 People are irritated by these habits of couples! Many times we use hot water to get rid of hair color
 agar aap bhi aisa karne kii soch rahe hai to saavdhaan ho jaaie
 Hair soaked with holi colors should not be washed with hot water, this can spoil your hair
 garm pani baalo ko ruukhaa bana detaa he
 Also, after washing the hair in Holi, do not dry it like a blower, but let it dry in a simple way
 holi ke do saptaah baad tak baalo ko color na karen

 tab vipaksh ne hangaamaa kiya tha ki tri kanoon ke mutabik iskaa adhyaksh ritair hone ke baad centre yaa rajya sarkaron se jude kisi pad par nahin baith saktaa he
 However, in its first term, the Modi government amended this law through an ordinance and appointed Mishra
 bharat ne kaha ki nai dilli main aagaamee 26-27 july ko hone vaali videsh mantri str kii vaarta main aatankwaad kaa mudda bhi shaamil hoga
 While returning from Dhaka after completing his three-day official visit to Bangladesh, External Affairs Minister SM Krishna told reporters that the issue of terrorism will also be included in the agenda for the forthcoming talks with the Pakistan Foreign Minister
 krishna ne in khabaron ko khaarij kar diya ki pichley maheene islamabad main donon deshon ke bich hui ‘videsh sachiv str kii vaarta’ main aatankwaad kaa mudda shaamil nahin tha
 He said that i refute the reports that the issue of terrorism was not included in the talks between the Foreign Secretaries of the two countries in Islamabad
 saath hi, yah kahana chahta hum ki vaarta main pakistan ke videsh mantri ke samaksh aatankwaad kaa mudda uthaaya jayega
 The Delhi government will have no idea that the thousands of guest teachers who have been called to count the achievements on Wednesday afternoon at the Chhatrasal Stadium will start raising slogans against CM Arvind Kejriwal
 darasal pichley kai saalon se sthaayee naukari, samaan vetan kii maang kar rahe guest teachers kaa gussa us vaqt foot padaa, jab mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal kii taraf in vaadon ko puraa karne ko lekar koi nayaa elaan nahin kiya gaya
 As soon as Kejriwal mentioned sending files to LG in his speech, guest teachers started getting up from their seats
 teachers ko jaataa hua dekh, siem kejariwal aanan fanan main apane bhaashan ko khatm kar stadium se ravaanaa ho gaye
 Teachers called Kejriwal's promises lollipop, even after this, the matter did not calm down
 ek shikshak ne aarope lagaaya ki jab vahakejarivalke bhaashan ko vaadon kaa lollypop bataa rahe the, tabhi dipti siem manish sisodiya ke daphtar main kaam karne vaale mahesh naam ke shaks ne unhen dekh lene kii dhamkee di or video bhi record kiya
 The protesting teachers allege that the Chief Minister is repeatedly lying to them
 guest teachers kii selary badhaane or unki naukari pakki karne kii ghoshnaa kaaphi pehle se kii ja rahi he, lekin ab tak kuch thos faisla nahin liya gaya
 Shortly after cm's departure from the stadium, the greatest teachers started shouting slogans against the Delhi government and Arvind Kejriwal
 sirf yahi nahin stadium ke baahar nikalate hi tamaam guest teachers ne ring road par kabza kar liya or kareeb 1 ghante tak rasta jam rakhaa
 a heavy police force was deployed to control the uproar of the teachers and use water canons to divert the crowd from the road
 haalanki police ko ring road se guest teachers ko hataane main badi jaddojahad kerani padi
 There are about 17 thousand guest teachers in Delhi
 Let us tell you that there are about 17 thousand guest teachers in Delhi
 49 dinon me rahi sarkaar kii banane ke baad se hi guest teachers aam aadmi party sarkaar par raajnneeti karne kaa aarope lagaate rahe hai
 The Kejriwal government tried to pacify the guest teachers, but the government's stance backfired
 haalanki arvind kejariwal ne chhatrasaal stadium main hue hangaame ko bijepi or congress kii saazish bataaya he
 During the speech, CM Arvind Kejriwal counted the salary received by the guest teachers in other states, saying that in Odisha, the guest teachers used to get Rs 5000 in the first month, the teachers went on fast for a month and the state government increased the salary to Rs 7500
 upi main 8 hajaar rupee maheenaa, rajasthan main 9 hajaar rupee, madhya pradesh main 10 hajaar 200 rupee, to bihar main 18 hajaar rupee or haryana main 21 hajaar rupee prati maah vetan miltaa he, lekin dilli main ab guest teachers kii har maheene kii selary ko 34 hajaar rupee tak badha diya he
 Kejriwal further said that 'now guest teachers will not be given salary according to every month or hour, but they will get holidays like regular teachers
 aaj yah sab elaan kar paane ke liye hamen vyavastha se bahut ladanaa padaa he
 The proposal has been passed by the Cabinet and sent to LG Sahab
 mujhe ummid he ki alji sahab shikshakon ke bhavishya se jude faisle par hami bharenge
 In the end, Kejriwal said that the Delhi government will complete the work of ensuring guest teachers as soon as possible
 '
 
 
 And at the end of the speech, Kejriwal said this thing became a big reason for the whole uproar
 pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa kahana he ki afasaron ko tanaav nahin lenaa chahie, kyonki wo tanaav lenge to phir dhang se kaam nahin kar paaenge
 PM Modi was giving a speech on the occasion of 'civil Service Day'
 piem ne kaha aap log bahut padhate honge, aap time management bhi acha kar lete hai, lekin kya aap parivaar ke saath quality samay bitaate hai? unhone kaha, tanavagrast vyakti kuch hasil nahin kar saktaa, visheshkar jab aapako desh chalaanaa ho to aapako tanaav main bilkul nahin hona chahie
 The comments pradhanmantri ne halke-pulke andaaj main kaha ki kya jahaan rahete hai vahaan aapako hameshaa syrius rahane ko kaha jaataa he
 Is there a restriction on being happy there? On this, the officers gathered there laughed fiercely
 yahi nahin unhone adhikariyon kaa mood halkaa karne ke liye kaha ki pareshaan naa hon main aapako koi nayaa kaam nahin bataaungaa
 Modi said, if the officials remain tense, then there will be no work and if there is no work then everyone will be upset
 piem ne kaha, aapkaa jivan filon ke ird-gird hi nahin guzarana chahie
 It is also necessary to spend quality time with the family
 zindagi robot jaisi nahin ho sakati
 The Prime Minister said in a light manner that if you live there, you are always told to be serious
 kya vahaan khush rahane par pabandi he? is par vahaan jamaa adhikariyon ne jamkar thahaake lagaae
 Not only this, he said to lighten the mood of the officials, "don't bother, i will not tell you any new work
" modi ne kaha, agar adhikari tanaav main rahenge to kaam nahin hoga or agar kaam nahin hoga to sabhi pareshaan honge
 PM said, your life should not pass around files
 parivaar ke saath quality samay bitaana bhi zaruri he
 Life cannot be like a robot
 modi ne kaha, agar adhikari tanaav main rahenge to kaam nahin hoga or agar kaam nahin hoga to sabhi pareshaan honge

 srinagar kii sadaken tuuti hui thim
 Abid said that roads were broken in the last flood
 tab se marammat nahin hui he
 At the end of the first day's journey we reached Hazratbal Dargah
 ye dal lake ke pashchim main he
 Its reflection in Dal Lake looks very beautiful
 yahaan paigambar mohammad sahab kaa bal rakhaa gaya he
 On special occasions it is brought out to see the devotees
 "kya ham andar ja sakate hai?" maine aabid se poocha
 "why not" said Abid
 car se utarate hi bhikhaariyon ne hamen gher liya
 We went inside with great difficulty
 get par bataaya gaya ki yahaan koi tikat nahin lagata
 When we started covering the head with a handkerchief, people there told that caps would be found inside
 mahilaon ko saamne se jane kii manaahi thi
 We took our shoes off and went inside
 vahaan kuch der ankhen moond kar baithe
 There was a strange fear in my heart, but it was comforting to sit there
 "acha nahin laga?" har jagah kii tarah aabid ne baahar nikalate hi poocha
 "why not
 acha tha
 There was peace
 " i started telling the children that terrorists had once entered here
 oktober 1993 main bhartiya sena ne hazaratbal ko gher liya tha
 There were 65 terrorists hiding here
 32 dinon tak hazaratbal sankat bana rahaa
 Later PV Narasimha Rao's government gave "safe passage" to the terrorists despite opposition from the army
 mujhe laga ki "aatankwaadi" shabd sunakar aabid ke jehan main kuch chalane laga tha
 Perhaps he did not like it, but he remained silent
 bilkul khamosh
 His silence was saying something
 shaam ho chuki thi
 We were all exhausted
 bhukh bhi jabardast lagi hui tha
 Abid dropped us to a pakodara who was near Dal
 usne bataa diya tha ki hamaara house boat ghat number 5 ke saamne he
 We arrived at gate number 5 after having tea and packing pakoras
 apane house boat vaale maqbool ko phone karte uske pehle ek shikare vaala aa gaya
 He knew which houseboat we stayed in
 pehle laga ki wo paise maangega, lekin usne paise nahin liye
 When the TV was not playing in our room, the children started making noise
 maqbool ne hamen bagal vaala room de diya
 After working there, he turned on a shabby TV, but there was another problem
 soni sicks par ipel kaa match aa to rahaa tha lekin awaz kisi duusare channel kii
 Maqbool could not fix it
 aaj kal ke bachche ghoomane se zyaada tivi dekhnaa pasand karte hai
 Well the fun of tea and dumplings on the houseboat itself was different
 house boat kii raat kii roshni main dal kii jagamagaahat behad dilkash hoti he
 i wanted to sit in the balcony of the houseboat, staring at the beauty of the Dal, but you cannot sit here peacefully
 achaanak ek pheriwala balakani main daakhil hota he or apane chijen faila kar hamen bechney kii koshish karata he
 But Abid had already told us that they are the only ones who know the boat
 kuch khareednaa nahin
 After he leaves, a non-veg seller arrives on a boat
 houseboat vaale ke parivaar ke log usase kuch kharid rahe the
 The staff of the house boat stay there
 hamaara bhi man ban rahaa tha ki usase kuch khariden
 Then he quickly washed the bowl in water
 aabid ne hamen bataaya tha ki boat kaa drenez dal main hi jaataa he
 Seeing a fly in tea was something to swallow
 kisi tarah non wez ko taala
 However the good thing was that there was no foul smell from the lake and we could not see a single mosquito
 tippaniyan a boat continued towards our balcony
 is baar photographer the, jo hamen vahaan kii paramparaagat poshaak main photo khinchvaane ke liye dabaav bana rahe the
 Hardly missed them too
 hamane apane house boat kii kichan kaa nirikshan kiya to laga nahin ki khaanaa banane ke liye kuch khaas saamaan padaa he
 Maqbal said that food can be made or it will bring it
 lekin mausam itnaa khushgavaar tha ki hamaari thakaavat ab tak dur ho chuki thi
 Maqbool drove us across the boat
 usne hamen shamyana restaurant main jane ke salaah di
 He said that big ministers also come there
 aabid ne hamen kahin or khaane ko bataaya tha
 Shamiana restaurant was near Dal
 hamen shamyana hi pasand aayaa
 Ambience was good
 saath vaale teble par ek yuva joda tha
 The boy appeared to be European and the girl Asian
 donon thode pareshaan lag rahe the
 The girl was talking to someone from the land line after going to the response
 tab tak vahaan khadaa waiter ne tang kapadon main pareshaan ladki ko upar se neeche tak ankhon se eksre karne main mashgool tha
 That is why someone has said that the country should be disguised as it is
 phone par baat karne ke baad ladki saamaanya hui
 Before ordering, both of them were trying to know the difference between Tandoori Chicken and Afghani Chicken
 jira rice ke bare main poocha
 The waiter was engaged in explaining them in fluent English
 donon ne dher sara khaanaa order kar diya
 Now i did not know by mistake or had the ability to eat so much because our food was finished before them
 khaanaa behad lajij tha or dilli ke muqaabale kaafii kam bill aayaa
 "can we go in?" i asked Abid
 "kyon nahin" aabid ne kaha
 As we got off the car, beggars surrounded us
 badi mushkil se peechha chhudaa ham andar gaye
 It was told at the gate that there is no ticket here
 ham roomaal se sir dhakne lage to vahaan logon ne bataaya ki tapiyaan andar mil jaaengi
 Women were prohibited from leaving
 juute utaar kar ham andar gaye
 Sitting there with some closed eyes
 dil main ajeeb-sa dar tha, lekin vahaan baithne se sukun mila
 "did not like?" Like everywhere Abid asked as soon as he left
 "kyon nahin
 it was good
 shanti thi
 " main bacchon ko bataane laga ki yahaan kabhi aatankwaadi ghus aae the
 In October 1993, the Indian Army surrounded Hazratbal
 yahaan 65 aatankwaadi chhipe hue the
 Hazratbal remained in crisis for 32 days
 baad main pivi narsingh raav kii sarkaar ne sena ke virodh ke baavjood aatankwaadiyon ko "sef paisej" de diya
 i felt that something was going on Abid's mind after hearing the word "terrorist"
 shaayad use acha nahin laga, lekin vah khamosh rahaa
 Absolutely silent
 uski khamoshi kuch kah rahi thi
 Evening had come
 ham sab thak kar chur ho chuke the
 Hunger was also very strong
 aabid ne hamen ek pakora vaale ke paas drop kiya jo dal ke paas hi tha
 He had told that our house boat is in front of Ghat No
 5
 chaay pi or pakora pack karake ham get number 5 pahunche
 a shikar arrived before calling Maqbool with his houseboat
 use maaloom tha ki ham kis house boat main tehre hai
 At first he thought that he would ask for money, but he did not take money
 hamaare room main tivi nahin chal rahaa tha to bacchon ne shor machaana shuru kar diya
 Maqbool gave us a room next door
 vahaan jatan kar usne jarjar tivi chalaa diya, lekin ek musiibat or thi
 The IPL match was coming on Sony Six but the voice of another channel
 maqbool ise thik nahin kar paaya
 Nowadays children like to watch TV more than walking
 khayr houseboat par chaay or pakora kaa mazaa hi alag tha
 In the night light of the houseboat, the sparkling of Dal is very attractive
 ji chahta tha ki houseboat kii balakani main baithe dal kii khubsuurati ke nihaarte rahen, lekin aap yahaan bhi shanti se nahin baith sakate
 Suddenly a hawker enters the balcony and spreads his things and tries to sell us
 lekin aabid ne hamen pehle hi taakid kar di thi ki ye naav waalon ke jaanane vaale hi hote hai
 Do not buy anything
 uske jane ke baad ek naav par non wez bechney vaala aa jaataa he
 The family members of the houseboat were buying something from him
 house boat ke karmchaaree vahiin peeche rahete hai
 We were also thinking that we should buy something from him
 tabhi usne jhat se katori dal ke pani main hi dho lee
 Abid told us that the drainage of the boat goes to Dal
 chaay main makkhi dekhakar nigalane vaali baat thi
 Somehow avoided non veg
 haalanki acchhee baat ye thi ki jhil se koi durgandh nahin aa rahi thi or ek bhi machhar hamen nazar nahin aayaa
 The comments ek naav hamaari balakani kii taraf badhati ai
 This time there were photographers who were pressurizing us to be photographed in their traditional attire
 kaafii mushkil se inase bhi peechha chuta
 When we inspected the kitchen of our house boat, it was not felt that there was anything special to cook
 maqubal ne kaha ki khaanaa ban bhi saktaa he yaa phir wo laa degaa
 But the weather was so delightful that our weariness was far from over
 maqbool ne hamen naav se us paar pahunchaa diya
 He advised us to go to Shamiana restaurant
 usne kaha ki vahaan bade-bade ministar bhi aate hai
 Abid told us to eat elsewhere
 shamyana restaurant dal ke paas hi tha
 We liked the evening only
 ambiens acha tha
 There was a young couple on the side table
 ladkaa european or ladki asian jaan padati thi
 Both looked a bit upset
 ladki rispecian par jaakar land line se kisi se baat kar rahi thi
 By then, the waiter standing there was busy eyeing a troubled girl in tight clothes from top to bottom
 isiilie kisi ne kah rakhaa he ki jaisaa desh vaisaa bhesh hona chahie
 The girl returned to normal after talking on the phone
 order dene ke pehle donon waiter se tandoori chikan or afgani chikan main antar jaananaa chaah rahe the
 Asked about Cumin Rice
 waiter dharapravaah english main unhen samajhane main laga hua tha
 Both of them ordered a lot of food
 ab galati se kiya yaa itnaa sab kuch khaanaa kii kshamta thi ye nahin jaan paaya kyonki unke pehle hamaara khaanaa khatm ho chukaa tha
 The food was very tasty and there was very little bill in comparison to Delhi

 By then, the waiter standing there was busy eyeing a troubled girl in tight clothes from top to bottom
 isiilie kisi ne kah rakhaa he ki jaisaa desh vaisaa bhesh hona chahie
 The girl returned to normal after talking on the phone
 order dene ke pehle donon waiter se tandoori chikan or afgani chikan main antar jaananaa chaah rahe the
 Asked about Cumin Rice
 waiter dharapravaah english main unhen samajhane main laga hua tha
 Both of them ordered a lot of food
 ab galati se kiya yaa itnaa sab kuch khaanaa kii kshamta thi ye nahin jaan paaya kyonki unke pehle hamaara khaanaa khatm ho chukaa tha
 The food was very tasty and there was very little bill in comparison to Delhi
 shaam ho chuki thi
 We were all exhausted
 bhukh bhi jabardast lagi hui tha
 Abid dropped us to a pakodara who was near Dal
 usne bataa diya tha ki hamaara house boat ghat number 5 ke saamne he
 We arrived at gate number 5 after having tea and packing pakoras
 apane house boat vaale maqbool ko phone karte uske pehle ek shikare vaala aa gaya
 He knew which houseboat we stayed in
 pehle laga ki wo paise maangega, lekin usne paise nahin liye
 When the TV was not playing in our room, the children started making noise
 maqbool ne hamen bagal vaala room de diya
 After working there, he turned on a shabby TV, but there was another problem
 soni sicks par ipel kaa match aa to rahaa tha lekin awaz kisi duusare channel kii
 Maqbool could not fix it
 aaj kal ke bachche ghoomane se zyaada tivi dekhnaa pasand karte hai
 Well the fun of tea and dumplings on the houseboat itself was different
 house boat kii raat kii roshni main dal kii jagamagaahat behad dilkash hoti he
 i wanted to sit in the balcony of the houseboat, staring at the beauty of the Dal, but you cannot sit here peacefully
 achaanak ek pheriwala balakani main daakhil hota he or apane chijen faila kar hamen bechney kii koshish karata he
 But Abid had already told us that they are the only ones who know the boat
 kuch khareednaa nahin
 After he leaves, a non-veg seller arrives on a boat
 houseboat vaale ke parivaar ke log usase kuch kharid rahe the
 The staff of the house boat stay there
 hamaara bhi man ban rahaa tha ki usase kuch khariden
 Then he quickly washed the bowl in water
 aabid ne hamen bataaya tha ki boat kaa drenez dal main hi jaataa he
 Seeing a fly in tea was something to swallow
 kisi tarah non wez ko taala
 However the good thing was that there was no foul smell from the lake and we could not see a single mosquito
 tippaniyan a boat continued towards our balcony
 is baar photographer the, jo hamen vahaan kii paramparaagat poshaak main photo khinchvaane ke liye dabaav bana rahe the
 Hardly missed them too
 hamane apane house boat kii kichan kaa nirikshan kiya to laga nahin ki khaanaa banane ke liye kuch khaas saamaan padaa he
 Maqbal said that food can be made or it will bring it
 lekin mausam itnaa khushgavaar tha ki hamaari thakaavat ab tak dur ho chuki thi
 Maqbool drove us across the boat
 usne hamen shamyana restaurant main jane ke salaah di
 He said that big ministers also come there
 aabid ne hamen kahin or khaane ko bataaya tha
 Shamiana restaurant was near Dal
 hamen shamyana hi pasand aayaa
 Ambience was good
 saath vaale teble par ek yuva joda tha
 The boy appeared to be European and the girl Asian
 donon thode pareshaan lag rahe the
 The girl was talking to someone from the land line after going to the response
 tab tak vahaan khadaa waiter ne tang kapadon main pareshaan ladki ko upar se neeche tak ankhon se eksre karne main mashgool tha
 That is why someone has said that the country should be disguised as it is
 phone par baat karne ke baad ladki saamaanya hui
 Before ordering, both of them were trying to know the difference between Tandoori Chicken and Afghani Chicken
 jira rice ke bare main poocha
 The waiter was engaged in explaining them in fluent English
 donon ne dher sara khaanaa order kar diya
 Now i did not know by mistake or had the ability to eat so much because our food was finished before them
 khaanaa behad lajij tha or dilli ke muqaabale kaafii kam bill aayaa

 In the night light of the houseboat, the sparkling of Dal is very attractive
 ji chahta tha ki houseboat kii balakani main baithe dal kii khubsuurati ke nihaarte rahen, lekin aap yahaan bhi shanti se nahin baith sakate
 Suddenly a hawker enters the balcony and spreads his things and tries to sell us
 lekin aabid ne hamen pehle hi taakid kar di thi ki ye naav waalon ke jaanane vaale hi hote hai
 Do not buy anything
 uske jane ke baad ek naav par non wez bechney vaala aa jaataa he
 The family members of the houseboat were buying something from him
 house boat ke karmchaaree vahiin peeche rahete hai
 We were also thinking that we should buy something from him
 tabhi usne jhat se katori dal ke pani main hi dho lee
 Abid told us that the drainage of the boat goes to Dal
 chaay main makkhi dekhakar nigalane vaali baat thi
 Somehow avoided non veg
 haalanki acchhee baat ye thi ki jhil se koi durgandh nahin aa rahi thi or ek bhi machhar hamen nazar nahin aayaa
 The comments ek naav hamaari balakani kii taraf badhati ai
 This time there were photographers who were pressurizing us to be photographed in their traditional attire
 kaafii mushkil se inase bhi peechha chuta
 When we inspected the kitchen of our house boat, it was not felt that there was anything special to cook
 maqubal ne kaha ki khaanaa ban bhi saktaa he yaa phir wo laa degaa
 But the weather was so delightful that our weariness was far from over
 maqbool ne hamen naav se us paar pahunchaa diya
 He advised us to go to Shamiana restaurant
 usne kaha ki vahaan bade-bade ministar bhi aate hai
 Abid told us to eat elsewhere
 shamyana restaurant dal ke paas hi tha
 We liked the evening only
 ambiens acha tha
 There was a young couple on the side table
 ladkaa european or ladki asian jaan padati thi
 Both looked a bit upset
 ladki rispecian par jaakar land line se kisi se baat kar rahi thi
 By then, the waiter standing there was busy eyeing a troubled girl in tight clothes from top to bottom
 isiilie kisi ne kah rakhaa he ki jaisaa desh vaisaa bhesh hona chahie
 The girl returned to normal after talking on the phone
 order dene ke pehle donon waiter se tandoori chikan or afgani chikan main antar jaananaa chaah rahe the

 The outcome of the win between Team India and the United Arab Emirates was already known
 kuch or hota to bahut bada ulatpher hota

 The team has scored a hat-trick of victories and the captain believes that the team will have to maintain a good performance
 dhoni ne kaha ki team india ke gendbaaz middle overon main wicket nikaal rahe hai
 Hence, bowlers are now able to put pressure on the opposition batsmen
 dhoni ne chot se vaapasi kar rahe bhubaneshwar kumaar kii gendbaazi kii bhi taareef kii
 Bhuvneshwar Kumar took one wicket in his name after spending 19 runs in 5 overs
 zaahir he team india ke fans captain dhoni kii har jeet ke baad unki taareef kar rahe hai
 Former Indian football captain Baichung Bhutia's name has also been added to this list, who believes that MS Dhoni is the best captain of Team India so far
 unhen lagata he ki dhoni is baar bhi world cap zarur jeetenge

 The Supreme Court refused to accept Azam Khan's affidavit
 court ne ajam khan ko dobaaraa bina shart maafeename kaa halafanama daakhil karne ko kaha he
 The court questioned one paragraph in the affidavit and said that if my statement hurt

 supreme court ne kendra sarkaar ko peedita ko kendriya vidhyalay main ek maheene ke andar bhartee karaane or sara kharchaa upi sarkaar dwaara dene ke aadesh sunaaya tha

 The US entered Afghanistan in 2001 after the 9 / 11 incident, when it also had the support of 40 countries, including Britain and Canada

 PAK ko nahin bakhshega america, ab aatanki funding kii ridh par najalmerica aatank ke garh afghanistan main pakistan kii madad se apane karrwai ko anjaam diya karata tha
 It is a different matter that Pakistan has also given shelter to many of the dreaded terrorists
 may, 2011 main america ne pakistan ke abtabad main chhipe aatanki osama bin laden ko ghuskar maar giraaya
 He did not even share Pakistan for this campaign
 america isi aarthik sainya madad ke naam par pakistan se apane kaam karwaata tha
 America is still engaged in efforts to eradicate terror and restore peace in Afghanistan
 is abhiyaan main use afghanistan ke padosi desh pakistan se madad leni hi padegi
 Even if complete help is not right, he will have to take a firm assurance that he will not give shelter to Afghan terrorists
 china banegaa madadgamb jab america ne sakht tevar dikhaate hue pakistan par sainya madad roak di he or vah bhavishya main sabhi tarah kii madad par roak lagane kii soch rahaa he
 So he will have to see how he will now carry out his mission in this country far from America
 duusari ore, america pakistan or afghanistan ko madad die jane ke naam par dakshin asia main apni pahunch banaae rakhata tha, ab vah pakistan se madad ke naam par usase kuch bhi karana sambhav nahin ho sakegaa
 The way Pakistan is showing its attitude, it seems that it should not help America
 afghanistan main america kii sthiti bahut acchhee he bhi nahin
 At the same time, Pakistan will turn to China after not getting help from America
 china ne hameshaa se paak kaa saath diyaahai or is morche par bhi uskaa puraa saath detaa dikh rahaa he
 At present, China is the only country in the international fraternity that is giving a tough challenge to America
 to isse saaf andaja lagaaya ja saktaa he ki is pratibandh se pakistan ko koi nuksaan nahin hoga balki wo do myanon main phaayde main hi dikh rahaa he
 The first will be free from American pressure
 doosraa apane yahaan aatankiyon ko panaah dene se rokane vaala koi nahin hoga
 China will not stop him from doing so because he knows that these terrorists can be used against India through Pakistan

 vahiin gujarat kii teen nami vishvavidhyalayon main ek survey kiya gaya jiskaa makasad tha matadhikaar ke prati yuvaaon ko jaagruk karnaa
 But the questions given in the query form were related to the post of Prime Minister of Narendra Modi
 is survey ko jahaan bijepi yuvaaon ke faisle ke taur par dekh rahi he, vahiin in sawaalon ko congress modi kii nai chaal bataa rahi he
 In fact, the survey was conducted under the chairmanship of Dr
 Suresh Patani, Senior Professor of MS University, Vadodara, among more than three thousand students of Gujarat's Sardar Patel University, Gujarat University and Maharaja Sayajirao University of Vadodara
 survey main chaatro se naam, pataa, sampark, voting ke bare main jaankaree to lee hi gayi, saath-hi-saath yah bhi sawaal poocha gaya ki desh ke vikaas purush ke taur par narendra modi or rahul gandhi main unki kya pasand he or isaki kya vajah he
 The survey included 92 percent Hindu students, 3 percent Muslim and 5 percent Christian students
 survey kaa jo nateeja aayaa wo behad chaukaaney vaala rahaa
 70 percent of young students voted in favor of Narendra Modi
 magar sirf 17 fisadi chaatr rahul gandhi ko yuva pradhanmantri ke taur par dekhnaa chaahate hai
 According to those who have done this survey, if the Bharatiya Janata Party has lost the Lok Sabha seat by a margin of 5 thousand to 50 thousand, if this youth comes in the voting list, then Narendra Modi can become a game changer
 is survey ke bare main dow suresh ptaani bataate hai ki 'hamen yuvaaon ke vot kii ahmiyat samajni hogi
 It is clear from the survey that the choice of youth is Narendra Modi
 meraa maananaa he ki isamen koi raajnneeti nahin honi chahie
 If the youth of the country sang out of voting, then it will not be good for the country
 'puure desh main pehali baar aisa semple survey hua jiske sankalan main kai college ke professor bhi khud jute
 But students take a different view about such political survey in education
 chaatr ye saaf maanate hai ki yah survey raajnneetik phaayde ke liye kiya gaya he
 According to some students of the university, if the purpose of the survey was true, then samples would be taken from all the 35 thousand students of the university
 udhar congress puure survey ko narendra modi kaa hiden agenda bataa rahi he, or unki maane to narendra modi jo khud vadodara shahar main emes uniwarsity ke chaatr sangh ke chunaavon main apni party ko jeet nahin dilaa paae to ve puure desh ke yuvaaon ko kya samajhenge
 The Congress termed the entire survey illegal and said that the Congress would strongly oppose it
 vadodara main congress netaa narendra ravat ne bataaya, ' bijepi ne vishvavidhyalayon ko raajnneeti kaa akhaada bana diya he, jisaki ham ghor ninda karte hai' 
 BJP is giving it the name of change, then the Congress is giving it the name of BJP politics, but it is clear from this survey that it is clear that BJP, or Congress both use this politics in education for their own benefit

 shah ne naagarikta sanshodhan kanoon ke khilaaf virodh par uthaae sawaal370, CAA, NRC sab congress ne paidaa kiye, aaj vahi virodh kar rahi haikendriya grahamantri amit shah ne deshbhar main naagarikta sanshodhan kanoon ke khilaaf ho rahe virodh pradarshnon ko lekar congress par sawaal uthaae hai
 He said on Tuesday that the issues on which the Congress is protesting today are all its issues
 370, CAA, NRC sab congress ne paidaa kiye, aaj vahi virodh karen to kya unase sawaal na karen
 Giving the example of the Ayodhya Act of 1994, Amit Shah said that even after following the Congress Act, i became communal
 
 So brother, why did you make such an act? i state on the Citizenship Amendment Act
 nehru ji ne samjhauta karke kaha tha ki hamaara vachan he ki ham apane alpsankhyakon kii suraksha karenge
 Congress also said this to many people
 unhone (congress) ye baat kahi to wo sampradayik nahin hue lekin ham kah rahe hai to communal ho gaye
 Then talk of NRC
 enarasi kaa concept rajeev gandhi lekar aae or shrimati sonia gandhi virodh kar rahi hai
 When Rajiv Gandhi brought him, he was secular and i am implementing his system and i am communal
 meri to samaj main nahin aa rahaa ki ham karen to karen kya? amit shah ne kaha ye sabhi aapke (congress) ke act the, kanoon the
 You made everything ab aap virodh kyon kar rahe hai
 They should ask questions
 ajtak ke 'agenda ajtak 2019' ke kaarykram main atithi ke taur par grih mantri amit shah ne kaha ki anuchhed 370 ko jab banaaya gaya tha, us samay samvidhan sabha main jyadatar netaa congress ke the
 Nehru ji has said in Parliament that if we wear 370 wears, we wear it
 isamen hamane nayaa kya kiya
 
 
 Brother you said that this is temporary
 amit shah ne kaha ki anuchhed 370 ko jab banaaya gaya tha us samay samvidhan sabha main jyadatar netaa congress ke the, isamen koi vivaad khadaa nahin kar saktaa he
 He (article 370) was written as provisional
 kyon asthaayee likhaa
 
 
 The If it is made permanent, there is no question of removing it
 use hataane kaa rasta 370 main daalaa gaya, kyon daalaa gaya? aapane (congress) hi daalaa he
 Nehru ji has said in Parliament that if we wear 370 wears, we wear it
 isamen hamane nayaa kya kiya
 
 
 Brother you said that this is temporary
 deshbhar main nae naagarikta kanoon or rashtriya naagarikta register (enarasi) ke mudde par amit shah ne kaha ki enarasi rajeev gandhi lekar aae tab wo secular tha, ab sonia gandhi virodh kar rahi hai
 Amit Shah said, 'let me make it clear that there will be no action on the basis of religion in NRC
 jo koi bhi enarasi ke tahat is desh kaa naagarik nahin paaya jayega un sabko nikaala jayega
 Therefore, it is a wrong thing to say that NRC is only for Muslims
 unhone kaha, 'duusari baat enarasi ko lekar koun aayaa? jo log virodh kar rahe hai unase poochna chahta hum ki ise koun lekar aayaa
 i want to ask Congress President and Ghulam Nabi Azad that when the Assam Accord was reached in 1985, the NRC was accepted for the first time
 uske baad 1955 ke naagarikta act main 3 disambar 2004 ko cloj 14 (e) joda gaya
 It is clear from this that UPA was in government on 3 December 2004
 hamaari sarkaar nahin thi
 Later, Rule 4 was added, which gives the power to create NRC across the country, that too was added on 9 November 2009
 us samay bhi congress kii sarkaar thi
 They are questioning us on their (congress) made law
 to kya aapane kanoon sho cese main rakhane ke liye banaaya tha? jaruri nahin lagata tha to kanoon kyon banaaya?'caa or NRC ko milakar dekhne par sawaal par uthta he ki sarkaar kii manshaa kya he? is sawaal par amit shah ne kaha ki is masale ko nirvachan kshetra ke saath jodakar mat dekhie
 It has to be looked back a little
 sabase pehali baat he ki desh kaa vibhaajan dharm ke aadhaar par nahin hona chahie tha
 But it is a bitter fact that this country was divided on the basis of religion
 bantwaaraa kabhi dharm ke aadhaar par nahin hona chahie, lekin congress ne bantwaaraa dharm ke naam par sarender kiya
 This country was divided on the basis of religion
 amit shah ne kaha ki congress ne desh kaa vibhaajan dharm ke aadhaar par kiya
 It should not have happened
