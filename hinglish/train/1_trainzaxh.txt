 Till January 10 last month, it was believed that the BJP may soon announce seat sharing in Uttar Pradesh with Apna Dal (S)
 iske tahat apana dal (es) ko mirzapur samet kul chaar siten kaa milanaa tay tha
 But sometimes the rounds of politics are also different

 The chief guest at the event was Patel, who is an MP from Mirzapur Lok Sabha constituency and also the Union Minister of State for Health
 lekin hairaani kii baat rahi ki kaarykram main bhaajapa kaa koi bhi vidhayak shaamil nahin hua jabaki mirzapur main bhaajapa ke 4 vidhayak hai
 Patel called the BJP bitter with the mass wedding program
 patel ne bhaajapa vidhayakon kii ninda kii kyonki unhone sarkaar ki nitiyon kii janata se duuri banaae rakhi
 Regarding the bjp's opposition, he said, "I have given the ultimatum to the BJP till 20 February
 If we do not listen or agree then it will be difficult to stay together
" 'anupriya kahati hai, party ne uchit forum par apni baat rakhi he ab bhaajapa ko tay karnaa he ki bhaajapa kya chaahati he
 Patel has demanded that the Apna Dal (S) party should get a seat in the Uttar Pradesh state cabinet
 unka tark tha ki jab suhel bhartiya samaaj party (esbspi) ke chaar vidhayak hone ke baavjood, unhen cabinet seat di ja sakati he to apana dal (es) ke paas 9 vidhayak hai to use cabinet kii kursi kyon nahin?jaahir he, patel aise bayanon ke jariye bhaajapa par dabaav badhanaa chaahati hai
 With which the cabinet can get more seats for the Lok Sabha elections in the state

 He asked why Sonia had sought support from Syed Ahmed Bukhari, the Shahi Imam of Jama Masjid during the Lok Sabha elections
 'iconomic times' main chhapi khabar ke mutabik do baar lok sabha ke saansad rahe moulana asaraarul haq ne kaha ki sonia ko bukhari se nahin milanaa chahie tha
 Maulana said that during the election campaign everyone should have appealed but it was not appropriate to appeal to a particular community
 jisane bhi aisa kiya, galat kiya
 Maulana is also a member of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board
 akhbaar ne moulana se sonia or bukhari kii baithak ke bare main sawaal poocha tha
 It should be noted that Sonia Gandhi met Ahmed Bukhari in April last and appealed to Muslim leaders to see that seculars do not get votes
 unki is baat se kaaphi ho-hallaa machaa tha or kaaphi aalochana bhi hui thi
 Maulana said that circumstances have changed now
 agar modi kaam karenge to jeetenge or agar kaam nahin karenge to haar jaaenge
 The youth voted in large numbers to Narendra Modi as he promised development
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki unki party modi ke saath sahyog karne ko taiyaar he basharte vah vikaas ko tej karen lekin ve kisi bhi haalat main jammu-kashmir se anuchhed 370 hatane nahin denge

 isliye is masale par daakhil kii gai janhit yachika ko radd kar dena chahie
 The government has also argued that pending pending DC bills do not fall into the category of irregularities as settlement of AC bills is a continuous process
 in tarkon se pare dekha jaae to maujuuda maamla naitikta kaa raag alaapne vaali nitish sarkaar ko anya purvavarti sarkaron kii shrenee main khadaa kar detaa he
 The government, which is always engrossed in self-pity, cannot easily overcome its poor financial management
 sieji ke tathyon par aadhaarit yah vivaad nitish sarkaar ke liye ek bada jhtka he
 The state government has also argued that DC bills have been found pending in various state governments and some branches of the central government as well
 udhaaharan ke liye, kendriya swasthya vibhaag ke 9,789
 14 crores Rs
 ke disi bill bhi lambit pade hai
 But here it is special that the government officials of Bihar have largely ignored the established procedures of Bihar Treasury Code
 is prakriya se judaa niyam bahut sidhaa haih asi bill ke baad disi bill diya janaa chahie jisamen us kharch se judaa vauchar hona chahie or us par varisht adhikari ke hastakshar hona bhi jaruri he
 But is this a simple case of accounting negligence? Or is there any other reality of this mess? At the moment, even experts are unable to come to any conclusion, but there are certain indicators that give some impression
 haalanki sieji report se nitish kumaar ke purvavartiyon par bhi aarope lage hai lekin unki sarkaar isliye zyada surkhiyon main he kyonki unke kaarykaal main nikaale gaye paise or uske evaj main jamaa na karaae gaye disi bilon kii sankhya bahut zyada he
 Since 2002-03, there has been a sharp jump in the amount withdrawn in lieu of AC bills, which can be understood to an extent
 lekin is tark ko kaatane vaala tathy bhi maujuud he, vah yah ki is avadhi ke dauraan asmyojit raashi main bhi ijapha hua he
 It is easy to find here that the larger the amount withdrawn, the less the deposits were deposited
 asmyojit raashi main nirantar vruddhi dekhi gai he
 The unadjusted amount 324 in 2002-03
 20 karod ru
 It was up 12 times to 3,810 in 2007-08
 84 karod ru
 Arrived at
 2007-08 main sarkaar ke vibhinn vibhaagon ne 7,081 asi bilon ke evaj main 3,860
 47 crores Rs
 ke kharch kaa daawa kiya tha
 But when it came to justifying this expenditure, the government only 49
 63 karod ru
 Submitted only 228 detailed contingency bills
 agar ise kisi bhi paimaane se aanka jaae to yah badi raashi he or isaki andekhi nahin kii ja sakati
 The ruling NDA coalition termed it simply a case of adjustment of bills and failure to account for expenditure
 duusari ore vipaksh is mudde ke jariye rajg ko chaaron khaane chit karne ke liye atyadhik vyagrata dikhaa rahaa he
 Though it has not been named a scam right now, the CAG has claimed in its report that the DC bill related to Vishal Lok Nidhi is too big to keep it hanging for a long time without any "serious financial indiscipline / irregularity"
 Can give rise to
 sieji ne ek kadam aage badhate hue bihar ko andhra pradesh sarkaar ke formule ko amal main laane ke liye kaha he, jahaan agar pehle asi bill kaa nibataan nahin kiya gaya he to vahaan lok nidhi se tisare asi bill ke jariye raashi nahin nikaali ja sakati
 The CAG report has clearly opened the box of controversies
 haalanki aniyamitataayen didio tak simit rahane vaali nahin
 Not only this, the officials of the treasury may also be pulled how they made other prepaid payments without taking utilization certificate for the payment made earlier
 isse bhi mahatvapurn yah ki kya ham afasarshahon ko audit sambandhi niyamon kii dhadgijayaan udaane kii chhot dene ke liye nitish sarkaar ko maaf kar sakate hai? kya yah sambhav he ki sarkaar puri tarah se bekhbar rahe? yaa, kya yah sarkaar dwaara bharose main dhokhaa khaane kaa maamla he? ab aise tathyon kii bharmaar he jo rajg ke jununee samarthakon ke liye bhi sarkaar kaa bachaav karnaa mushkil banaakar rakh denge
 Clearly, the government would not have been completely oblivious to the irregularities that were carried out on such a large scale
 yahi nahin, rajya sarkaar kaa aantarik audit wing bhi pehle drawing or disbarsing adhikariyon dwaara is tarah kii gadabadiyon kii baat kah chukaa he
 The period for which the state government auditors had put the question mark was the period from 1989-90 to 2004-05
 is baar chaunkaane vaala tathy yah saamne aayaa he ki bihar sarkaar ne in aniyamittaaon ko paanv pasaarne kaa mauka diya
 Shouldn't a government claiming good governance in Bihar have been extra cautious as the state has already been infamous for scams? For example, a flood scam in which funds released for flood relief work were disturbed
 iskaa khulaasa us samay ho sakaa jab asi bilon ke evaj main jari kiye gaye vaucharon kii jaanch hui
 The common argument given about this may be that many audit objections can be quite complex to investigate
 2006 main, hycourt ke ek anya adhivaktaa mahendra prasad gupta ne gaban kii gai raashi ke bare main jaankaree dene ke liye janhit yachika daayar karke nyaayik hastkshep kii maang kii thi-rajya sarkaar ke auditoron ke mutabik yah raashi lagbhag 1,700 karod ru
 Had
 baad main 2008 main hycourt ne rajya sarkaar dwaara karrwai report jamaa karaane or gadabadi kii gai raashi ke bare main uchit kaarywahi karne ke sarkaar ke vaade ke baad yachika kaa nibatara kar diya tha
 The question here arises as to how the state government can ignore the objections of the CAG, even though in the past it has promised to address the irregularities introduced by the state auditors
 baharhaal, ateet main bhi bihar kii rajg sarkaar alag-alag maamalon main sarkari paise hadapney ke aarope main didio ke khilaaf praathmikiyaan darj kara chuki he
 In this perspective, one is forced to think that how can the facts presented by the CAG be ignored in the present when an FIR has been filed in such cases in the past? The Bihar government has refused to learn the lesson
 sieji report kahati he ki usne akele march 2007 main 3,849
 30 crores Rs
 ke kul kharch main se 2,375
 04 crores Rs
 sankshipt aakasmik bill par nikaale the
 Apparently this was done at the end of the financial year to not allow the fund to go waste
 lekin, isane audit or account ke niyamon ke makasad ko hi bemaani kar diya
 So what are the state agencies doing? Ram Vilas Paswan, head of the Lok Janshakti Party, says, "this is an upper assessment because state agencies cannot get to the bottom of the case
" iske liye kendriya jaanch kii jarurat he
 "it is clear that the Assembly elections are on the head, due to which the political enthusiasts in the state are intensifying, but the recent sight in the Bihar Assembly was the result of the controversy over the CAG report
 bihar ke vipahni dalon ne, jo abhi tak nitish kii chaalon kaa jawaab dene main sakasham nahin the, is mudde ko hathohath lapak liya
 An example of this was the view presented in the state assembly on Tuesday and Wednesday
 ye do din bihar vidhansabha ke itihaas main kaale aksharon main darj honge
 After a lot of uproar and other controversial situations, 67 opposition mlas were suspended and removed from the assembly
 is vivaad se raajnneetik hit saadhane ke liye sabase aage najar aa rahe rajd pramukh lalu prasad yadav ne kaha, 'jab 2006 kii sieji report main aniyamitataayen dikhaai gayi thi to bihar sarkaar ne khud se karrwai kyon nahin kii? nitish kumaar ko sibiai jaanch puri hone tak pad se istipha de dena chahie
 In the meantime, Nitish Kumar, while talking to reporters, refused to talk about this matter and said that it would not be right to talk on this issue out of court
 unhone istife kii vipakshi maang par chutki lete hue kaha, ''unki khushrahmi kshanik sabit hogi
 "of course Nitish uttered brave words
 lekin jis uthkanthaa ke saath unki sarkaar ne sibiai jaanch kaa virodh kiya usase ye sanket milte hai ki ve jaanate hai ki sieji vivaad unhen aagaamee chunaav main kis tarah kaa nuksaan pahunchaa saktaa he

 But it seems that this new controversy that arose in the election year has created another front for him, which needs attention
 yadav ne kaha ki rashtriya str par samaan vichaardhaara vaale sabhi vipakshi dalon kii ekajutata, gambhir chunauti jarur he lekin yah chunauti naammumkin nahin he
 On the question of the BJP being strengthened by the mistakes of the young leadership, which is commanding other opposition parties including the Congress, SP, RJD and RLD, Yadav said that the mistake of denying the experience has to bear the brunt and the correction of this mistake also results immediately

 Rajasthan Police Recruitment Notice: Read order here vittiya len dein ke madhyam ke rup main check kii vishwasaneeyata badhaane or check-bouns maamalon se prabhavit choti or majholi ikaayiyon kii madad ke liye sarkaar ne maujuuda negoshiable instruments act -1881 main sanshodhan ko aaj manjuuri de di
 Now the courts will provide interim compensation to the aggrieved party
 sutron ne kaha, sarkaar is kanoon main sanshodhan ke jariye aisa praavdhaan karegi ki aise maamalon main sunwaayee ke dauraan adaalatein chahen to check likhane waalon ke khilaaf peedit paksh ko antarim muaavje kaa bhugtan karne ke aadesh jari kar saken
 According to sources, the government has also proposed such a provision at the appellate level that the appellate court can order the appellant writing the check to deposit a part of the compensation decided by the trial court at the time of filing the appeal
 sanshodhan ko sansad ke maujuuda sheetakaaleen satr main hi pesh kiya ja saktaa he
 Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, while giving details of the decisions taken in the cabinet meeting, said that the amendment in the Negotiable Instruments Act-1881 has been approved
 haalanki unhone byora nahin diya
 The comments sutron ke anusaar sarkaar maanati he ki check likhane vaale ke khate main paryaapt paisa na hone yaa anya kaarnon se check bina bhugtan ke laut jane se choti or majholi ikaayiyon ko lambit avadhi main bahut pareshaani or kaarobaar kaa bada nuksaan hota he
 The government is understood to have made amendments to the 'negotiable Instruments Act 1881' on the basis of suggestions received from the general and business community in this regard and to provide for interim compensation at both the trial and appeal stage for the aggrieved party
 sarkaar ke samaksh ek saamaanya shikaayat yah bhi he ki beimaan kism ke log bhugtan main vilamb karne ke liye check bouns ke hatkande apanaate hai
 When the check bounces, the aggrieved party has to spend a lot of money and time in courts to get their money
 sutron ke anusaar sarkaar sambandhit kanoon main aisa sanshodhan kar rahi he ki adaalatein chahen to sunwaayee ke dauraan peedit paksh ko antarim bhugtan kaa aadesh kar saken
 If the person writing the check is acquitted of the case, the other party will have to return the amount of the interim compensation
 isi tarah apiliy adaalat bhi maamle ko daakhila lete samay nichali adaalat dwaara tay muaavje kaa ek hissaa jamaa karaane kaa aadesh kar sakegi
 Sources said that this will increase the credibility of the check as a medium of payment and this step will also give a boost to the government's plans to reduce the circulation of cash for payment
 sutron ke anusaar sarkaar ne apiliy str par bhi aisa praavdhaan kaa prastaav kiya he ki apiliy adaalat check likhane vaale apilkarta ko sunwaayee adaalat dwaara tay muaavje kaa ek hissaa apil daakhil karne ke samay hi jamaa karne kaa aadesh kar sake

 punjab kemogaamen 26 sitambar ko fateparcel bamka sach saamne aa gaya he
 On Wednesday, Panjabpulis arrested 42-year-old Raja Rizwan, who sent parcel bombs, from Rourkela in Odisha
 aaropee rigwan ne police poochtacha main kabool kiya ki uskachachere bhaike saath sampatti ko lekar vivaad tha, jiske chalate usne apane chachere bhai ko jaan se maarane ke liye parcel main bam bheja tha
 According to the police, the idea of sending a parcel bomb to the accused Raja Rizwan came from a parcel bomb blast in Patna, Odisha in February this year, in which a man and his mother-in-law were killed, while his wife was seriously injured
 It was done
 bataa den ki 26 sitambar ko ek anjaan vyakti moga main korier kii dukaan parparcebhejne aayaa tha, jisamen bhejne vaale ne apana pataa nahin likhaa tha
 The man had given the parcel to the courier's franchise running back Amit Sood, saying it had T-shirts

 dhoni ab bhi sabase feet khilaadiyon main se ek hai, krij par dhoni kii furti dekhte hi banati he

 Major companies of the world like Google and Facebook build their data centers in Dhanda countries so that the servers are stacked
 duniya kii sabase badi software company microsoft ne sarvars ko dhanda rakhane ke liye data centre ko samudr ke andar rakhane kii taiyaari main he
 The company has also developed a prototype for this and tested it
 microsoft neproject naticke tahat data centres ko samudra ke andar rakhaa jayega
 This will save the company money as well as it will not harm the environment too much
 gauratlab he ki data centres main rakhe lakhon sarvars ko dhanda rakhane ke liye air condishning par kaaphi kharch karne hote hai
 Apart from this, data centers have to be made at a place where the temperature is less than zero degrees
 time or paise kii bachat hogipani ke andar data centres rakhane kaa matlab sarvars ko thanda rakhane ke liye zyada kharch karne kii zarurat nahin hogi
 Microsoft also believes that capsules for data centers will be ready in just 90 days whereas it takes 2 years to build a data center on the ground
 is project main shaamil ejiniers kaa yahaan tak maananaa he ki ek din samudra ke andar rakhe data centres underwater terbine yaa tider power kii madad se khud bijli bana sakate hai
 The prototype data center, a 105-day underwater company, started working on the idea from 2013
 2014 main iskaa physical prototip banaaya gaya or pichley saal agast main company ne pehla sabamarine sarwar taiyaar kiya
 The server was placed in an 8-foot diameter steel capsule and placed on the California coast

 Bollywood superstar Salman Khan's 'da-bang Tour to Nepal' has been canceled
 10 march ko salmaan nepal daure main live prastuti ke liye jane vaale the
 It is now being said that Salman's show had to be canceled in view of the threat of Maoist organization led by Bikram Chand Biplav
 news agency ienes ke mutabik kathmandu ke tundikhel main hone vaale is sho main salmaan ke saath sonakshi sinha, kriti sinan, prabhudeva, daiji shah, meet bros or manish paal bhi shaamil hone vaale the
 The show was aimed at promoting tourism in Nepal affected by the 2015 earthquake
 inhone banaaya salmaan khan ko superstar, de chuke hai kai blockbsteryojakon ne kathmandu main 19 farvari ko ek press conference main salmaan ke aayojan main hissaa lene kii pushti bhi kii thi
 This led the cpn-maoist, a faction led by Bikram Chand Biplav, who had split from the ruling cpn-maoist Center in Nepal, to seek cancellation last week
 unhone sabhi rashtravaadi takaton se ek hokar aise aayojan kaa virodh karne kii apil bhi kii thi
 Film wrap: Papon, Salman had 110 Nepali singers and dancers to participate in the event, if not reports on the date for this man
 aayojan main 30 hajaar darshakon ke bhaag lene kii ummid thi
 The price of the ticket was kept from three thousand rupees to 30 thousand rupees
 aayojan par kul paanch karod rupee kharch hone kaa anumaan tha
 Let me tell you that it has been heard from the organizers in Kathmandu that given the current situation, the show has been postponed for some time
 jald hi is bhavy kaarykram kii nai taarikh kaa elaan kiya jayega
 However, it is not clear whether Salman will participate in the event on the new date
 atthavan saal ke jagat prakaash nadda bhartiya janata party ke pehle kaaryakari adhyaksh honge
 His predecessor, the new home minister Amit Shah, will continue as chairman until his term ends in December
 uske baad party ke 'ek vyakti-ek pad' siddhant ke anuroop nadda ke party adhyaksh banane kii sambhaavna he
 a BJP functionary who closely watched Nadda's functioning in 2014 as party general secretary and in-charge of Chhattisgarh says, "he is a good manager working under a good chairman and certainly some kind of damaging nature
" Are not ''yah tippanee waisi hi he jaisi nadda ke bare main party ke duusare logon kii dharna he ki ve bharosemand vyakti hai
 What is hidden with this assumption is that Shah and Prime Minister Narendra Modi have confidence in Nadda that they do what they are told and their own political aspirations are limited
 shah ke grahamantri banane ke baad se bhaajapa sadasyon or rajnatik vishleshkon kaa anumaan tha ki party main satta ke liye aantarik khinchataan hogi
 Pulling for power would have been unavoidable in the absence of the right man at the top
 lekin kam se kam apane kaarykaal kii samaapti tak shah party kii gatividhiyon par niyantran banaae rakhenge
 After the party board meeting on Nadda's appointment, Modi said that the new executive chairman is "ascendant and hard-working"
 unhone yah bhi joda ki ''ve (nadda) party ke nichle str se upar aae hai or bhaajapa parivaar main unki izzat he
 "it is worth noting that Nadda is also popular and respected in the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh
 un par modi kii nigaah us vakt padi thi jab 1990 ke dashak ke madhya main modi bhaajapa sachiv ke rup main himachal pradesh ke prabharee the or nadda rajya sarkaar main mantri the
 Nadda was in his fourth decade of life at the time and Modi liked his disciplined work style and obedience to the party
 nadda puraani style ke rajnatik hai, jo bina tamzam ke apane kshetra ke logon se samvaad banaae rakhte hai
 As the Health Minister in the previous Modi government, Nadda's office was often crowded with well-wishers from Himachal Pradesh
 bhaajapa netaa or kaaryakarta unhen garmjosh or milansaar maanate hai
 Analysts say that Nadda's art of keeping people happy will be helpful on difficult occasions of dissatisfaction or power politics
 party ke sanghathanaatmak chunaavon or atyant mahatvapurn maharashtra, haryana or jharkhand ke vidhansabha chunaavon ke maddenjar agar ve koi kathor nirnay lene ko baadhya honge (yaa aisa karte dikhenge) to unki nijee lokapriyata unke liye madadgaar hogi
 Yet the question that remains is whether he will be able to show Shah-like activism and continue the same laborious program of yatras? In his 1,700-day tenure as BJP president, Shah has been on a 1,000-day yatra
 nadda ko kabhi itani yatraaen nahin kerani padi hai, na hi unhen itani nirantarata se kaam karnaa padaa he
 Of course, while in government, he got a close look at the working style of Modi and Shah and is aware of the level that they expect from colleagues
 swasthya mantri ke rup main nadda par baari-bharkam or jatil ayushmaan bharat yojana ke karyanvayan kii jimmedaari rahi he
 After his appointment as acting president, Nadda thanked Shah for "reposing confidence in me" and added that "my job will be, i can be in tune with his and the party's expectations"
 ''sanghathan chunaavon se itar shah, modi or aresas ke saath nadda ke sambandhon ko dekhte hue unka bhaajapa adhyaksh bananaa aupchaarikta bhar hoga
 Had the RSS gone, Nadda would have been the BJP President after Rajnath Singh in 2014, but Modi chose Shah under whom the bjp's membership claims to have increased from two crore to 11 crore and after success in many state elections, the party was in the Lok Sabha

 In fact, the Ministry of Railways in Jharkhand closed the 34-km-long dhanbad-chandrapur railway line on 15 June 2017
 ye rail line 1894 se chal rahi thi
 The Ministry of Railways claims that, in this route a fire is burning in the coal mine under the rail track and there is a danger of fire even further
 lekin ilaake main kaam thapp hone or jivan yaapan par maar padane ke chalate 230 logon aisa khat likhane ko majaboor ho gaye hai

 The year 2017, Karimati village in Simdega district of Jharkhand suddenly came into the limelight
 vaise to is gaanv kii har jhopadi garibi kii ek alag hi daastaan kahati he lekin us din to had ho gai jab yahaan kii ek jhopadi main ek 11 saal kii adivasee bacchee ne bhaat-bhaat kehete hue dam tod diya
 There was a lot of uproar from Jharkhand to Delhi
 prashasan harakat main aayaa or bhukh se hui is maut ko beemaari se hui maut main tabdeel kar diya
 It was written in the medical report that grains of grain were found in Santoshi's intestines
 maukey par pahunche sthaneey log or kuch saamaajik kaaryakarta chillachillaakar kehete rahe us jhopadi ke bartan or dibbon main ann kaa ek dana tak nahin tha
 Saryu Rai, who was a minister of food and consumer affairs in the government at the time, took a rebellion after dissolving with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)
 unhone us samay bhaajapa kii raghuvar sarkaar kaa bachaav karte hue kaha tha, ‘‘ hamane har aarope kii jaanch karai lekin hamen bhukh se hui maut kaa koi udhaaharan nahin mila
 Jharkhand Pahala is a state that has formed a committee to define the definition of death due to hunger
 ’’ yah fark baat he ki aaj sarayu raay raghuvar sarkaar main do darjan se zyada ghotaale hone kaa daawa kar rahe hai
 Not only this, he is saying, "it seems like my destiny is to send Raghuvar Das to jail like former Chief Ministers Lalu Prasad Yadav, Jagannath Mishra and Madhukoda
 ’’ bhale hi sarkaar bhukh se hui mauton ko maanane se inkaar kare lekin mashhoor saamaajik kaaryakarta ritika kheda ke netritv main bani ek fact finding team ne daawa kiya ki pichley paanch saal ke dauraan jharkhand main kam se kam 22 logon kii maut bhukh se hui he
 Kheda also released a list of deaths due to hunger
 report ke mutabik 28 sitambar 2017 ko simdega jile ke karimati gaanv main 11 saal kii santoshi kii maut se pehle hazaribagh jile ke indradev mahali kii maut bhi bhukh se hui thi
 It was the first death due to hunger during the tenure of Raghuvar Das's government
 iske alaava bhi 18 logon kii maute huin
 Sadly, all the people who died are from tribal communities
 san 2000 main bihar se katkar ek rajya kaa darja paane vaale jharkhand ke liye yah baat tab or badi ho jaati he jabaki yahaan par raghuvar das se pehle nau baar mukhyamantri bane saare netaa adivasee samudaay ke the
 Raghuvar Das became the first leader who belonged to a non-tribal community
 raghuvar hi pehle aise mukhyamantri bhi hai jinhone 19 saal pehle bane is rajya main apana kaarykaal puraa kiya
 BJP rebel veteran Saryu Rai said in a conversation with India Today during the 2014 assembly elections, "jharkhand has about 28 per cent tribal population
 adivasee andolanon ke bal par hi ise rajya kaa darja bhi mila he
 But no major state level leader developed here
 jila str ke netaaon ne rajya or uske khajaanon kii kaman sanbhali or thekedaar, khanan mafia or maovadiyon ke gathjod ne unhen aasaani se barbaad kar diya
 This fact is also true because if you take the history of any tribal chief minister, you will find that his influence has never been statewide
 jharkhand mukti morcha ke pravaktaa supriyo bhattacharya se yah poochne par ki kya bhukh se mauton kaa mudda unke ghoshnaa patr main pramukhataa se shaamil hoga? ve kehete hai, bilkul is mudde ko sabase zyada hamaari party ne hi uthaaya
 This is our 'issue'
 yah baat sach bhi he ki jeemem ne is mudde par bhaajapa ko khub gherne kii koshish kii
 But the danger is also that by joining the manifesto, this issue may not remain as a weapon to win the election
 khayr, philhal to satta us party ke haath main he jiske liye ‘‘rajya main bhukh se mautein hui hi nahin
 "it is also to be seen whether Saryu Rai, the rebel leader of his own party who called the Raghuvar government from head to nail in corruption, raises this issue or not?" It is also to see whether about 28 percent of the tribal population are united on this issue or not? The biggest news among the local journalists today is that a local reporter of the national channel faced heavy rebuke because he had questioned a BJP leader on hunger deaths due to the instigation of the opposition leader

 naidu ne pehle ghoshnaa kii thi ki 22 november ko sabhi dalon kii baithak hogi
 There were speculations that there might be a big announcement in this
 lekin 19 november ko pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee se milane ke baad ab meeting kii taarikh taal di gai he, ab yah 19 janvari ko hogi
 Mamta Banerjee says that on January 19, she wants to hold a big rally at the Brigade Parade Ground in Kolkata, in which all parties are expected to attend
 basapa supremeo mayawati isamen shaamil hongi yaa nahin is sawaal par chandrababu naidu kaa kahana he ki wo lagaataar mayawati ke sampark main hai
 Efforts will be made to join this rally
 chehre ke bina mukaam milanaa mushkildusri ore, is mahagathbandhan se ittefaq nahin rakhane waalon kaa kahana he ki jab tak netritv par faisla nahin ho jaataa in koshishon ko mukaam milanaa mushkil he
 On Monday, when Naidu was asked who would be the face of the Grand Alliance
 to mamata banerjee bich main bol padin ki mahagathbandhan kaa har netaa iskaa cheharaa hoga
 Chandrababu Naidu said that he is senior to Modi and has also done a great job with him
 aise bayanon se yah sandesh janaa swaabhaavik he ki sabko ek manch par laana itnaa aasaan nahin he
 There has been talk about sp-bsp's own story, BSP and SP will fight elections together, but doubts have also been raised about this till the elections
 aisa kaha jaataa he ki mayawati jo bhi faisle lengi vah uttar pradesh ko dekhte hue lengi
 If the alliance of the two is not able to climb in UP, then it is difficult to climb the grand alliance
 mayawati kahin se bhi aisa nahin chahengi kii unke saamne akhilesh majboot hon
 Similarly, Akhilesh may have said that he is ready to give more seats to BSP to defeat BJP but he will never want to suffer any loss in UP
 mamata ko manaanaa kahin mushkil to nahinsipiem mahasachiv seetaram yechuri ne pehle hi kah diya tha ki bhaajapa ko haraane ke liye vah gathbandhan main shaamil hone ke liye taiyaar hai
 He also met DMK chief Stalin
 unhone kaha tha ki aise gathbandhan pehle rajya str par hote hai
 Then it gets shaped at the country level, but there is a doubt that Mamata will be willing to share the platform with CPM
 mamata kii puri raajnneeti pashchim bengal ko lekar rahati he
 It is believed that if they enter into any agreement with the CPM and the Congress, the BJP will get a sitting issue and will help it to gain a foothold in West Bengal
 kitne saath honge kejarivalchandrababu naidu ne dilli ke siem arvind kejariwal se bhi mulaakaat kar unase bhaajapa virdohi morche main shaamil hone kii apil kii thi
 But political critics say that Kejriwal, who is desperate to spread his footing outside Delhi, will be able to accept someone's leadership
 unke paas kehane ke liye bhi bahut kuch he
 He stopped the bjp's chariot in the Delhi Assembly elections at a time when the wind of the BJP was blowing all over the country
 sharad pavaar pehle hi andeh jataa chuke hanchandrababu naidu jab sharad pavaar se mili the to unhone bhaajapa virdohi morcha banane kii vakaalat kii thi
 But in Aaj Tak's program itself, Sharad Pawar has expressed doubts over the formation of a grand alliance
 ek duuri baat yah bhi he ki agar chandrababu naidu kah sakate hai ki wo modi se senior hai to sharad pavaar to in donon se senior hai
 Why can't they be that face again? rahul kyon nahin ?congress bhaajapa ke baad sabase badi party he
 Rahul Gandhi has publicly expressed his wish that he is a prime ministerial candidate
 agar mahagathbandhan ban rahaa he or sabhi milakar bhaajapa ke khilaaf chunaav lard rahe hai to rahul gathbandhan kaa cheharaa kyon nahin ho sakate
 They come together but do not get the attention Chandrababu Naidu said in Kolkata on Monday that the institutions are in danger, what is happening from RBI to CBI is in front of everyone
 agar desh ko bachaana he to gaiyr bhaajapa dalon ko ek hona hi hoga
 All the parties are keeping coincidence with this thing, but the matter is probably stuck on who will be the face

 According to the top legal officials, the message is part of regular conversations to help the accused in many cases, which are in code language
 2013 main ek duusare bibiem sandesh main kuraishi ne singh se poocha, 'jo file aap mere paas chhod gaye he kya unamem se kuch kagajaat aapako chahie
 'singh's answer was,' Some very modest papers
 'haalanki kuraishi ne tabhi se sandesh main zikr kii gai kisi bhi tarah kii file se inkaar kiya he
 While this message was found by the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team in his laptop during the raid at Qureshi on 15 February
 is bare main singh ne bhi inkaar kar diya ki bibies sandesh kisi bhi coded baatcheet kaa hissaa tha
 He said, 'qureshi was on a tour of London, so i asked him to get some shirts from Paris shops
 ' iske alaava jis niabandh kaa zikr kiya ja rahaa he vah meri beti ke liye antarrashtriya ghooseghori par aadhaarit tha, jise maine kuraishi ko formating ke liye diya tha

 In this episode of BBM messages, Qureshi earlier asked Singh, "do you want anything from here?"
 ' singh kaa jawaab tha, 'us dukaan se kuch shart le aana, lekin slim feet nahin
 'it is worth mentioning that during May itself, there were reports that Income Tax officials are investigating the BBM messaging between Qureshi and Singh
 in sandeshon se saaf tha ki donon ek duusare ko acchhee tarah jaanate hai, isliye kaarobaari kuraishi ne api singh se 'help' maangi thi
 In the review report submitted by the Income Tax authorities to the Supreme Court, Qureshi has been put in the dock of 'unclear income'

 is form ne public sector ke bainkon (jisamen bank of india bhi shaamil he) ke saath 800 karod kaa frod kar daalaa
 In this case, the Supreme Court, while hearing a PIL by senior advocate Prashant Bhushan, sought a review report from the Income Tax authorities

 Let us tell you that the government has fixed the minimum support price i
e
 MSP on soybean ₹
 3399 rupye prati quintal lekin jab hamane poocha ki uski soyabean kya bhav biki to akhilesh ne bataaya use soyabean kaa bhav ₹
 3240 per quintal
 yani emspi se puure 1060 rupee kam
 Not only Akhilesh, but the soybean of farmer Parvat Singh, who came from Shahjahanpur in Sehore district, also sold less than MSP
 parvat singh ne bataaya ki uski soyabean ₹
 Sold at the rate of 3252 per quintal which is ₹ from MSP
 1050 kam tha
 Describing his misery, Parvat Singh said that the cost of bringing diesel, pesticides, fertilizers, wages and crop from tractor trolley to mandi is added, then the cost per quintal is about ₹
 3500 se ₹
 By 4000, in such a situation, only death of the farmer is being done
 kisaanon kii maang he ki soyabean kii emspi ko badhaakar kam se kam ₹
 5000 per quintal, so that the cost incurred on the crop is recovered and at the same time there is little benefit
 haalanki, is bare main mandi ke munim kaa kahana he jab market main demand hi kam he to emspi kaise mili?hamane munim baadaam singh se baat kii to usne bataaya ki kisaan nuksaan main nahi he kyonki ₹
 At an MSP of 3399, he has ₹
 3200 rupee mil hi rahe hai or ₹
 500 from Bhavantar on behalf of the government but when we asked that the amount of Bhavantar will be received this time, then Munim Badam Singh himself said that this time the farmer will hardly get the amount of Bhavantar
 baadaam singh ne bhav kam milane kii ek or vajah bataai
 He told that the soil is very much in the soybean crop, so many times the prices on the quality of soybean are also decided through auction
 makka par bhi emspi ko namandi main soyabean ke alaava in dinon makka bhi acchhee taadaad main aa rahaa he
 Let us tell you that the MSP on maize is ₹
 1700 he lekin makka bhi emspi se kaaphi kam bhav par bik rahaa he
 Aamir Ali, a farmer who came to sell maize from Ratibar village, also had to sell his produce at a lower price than MSP
 aamir ko makka ₹
 1421 per quintal had to be sold ie MSP to ₹
 279 kaa ghaataa
 Aamir Ali told how day to day farming is becoming difficult for the farmers because the prices of all other things are increasing, but the amount received on the crops has remained low
 aamir kii hi tarah kodiya gaanv ke kisaan mahendra gaur bhi ek trollies bhar ke makka bechney aae lekin unhen bhi emspi se neeche ₹
 Around 1400 had to sell maize
 inaki upaj kharidne vaale vyapaaree se jab hamane poocha ki kyon emspi se kam bhav mil rahe hai to usne kaha ki jo bhav nilaamee main tay hue uske hisaab se hi makka kharida gaya he
 Here too, the farmers claimed to have reduced the loss from the amount of the conveyance, but when asked if their amount would come, the merchant did not have the answer
 saaf he beete saal ke mukaable emspi badhaakar sarkaar ne vaahvahee to lut lee lekin kisaanon ko bhul gai kyonki kisaan aaj bhi vahiin khadaa he or laagat se behad kam keemat parfasalabechney ko majaboor he

 a radio station in the East Midlands is surrounded by controversies by broadcasting a unique advice to its listeners
 is radio stesan par ek islamic vidwaan ne shrotaaon ko un doctoron kii salaah ko nazarandaaj karne ke liye kaha tha jo muslim nahin hai

 Regulatory body Ofcom received a complaint regarding the show asking listeners to seek advice on issues related to Islam

 lekin ravat par baagiyon ko hawa dene or bhaajapa ke asantusht netaa ramesh pokharial 'nishank' se kathith santhganth kar chunaav main kuch bade netaaon ke khilaaf kaam karne ke aarope lag rahe hai
 Sonia Gandhi's political advisor Ahmed Patel and Congress general secretary Digvijay Singh are reportedly mobilizing Rawat
 mukhyamantri ke chayan main nirnaayak suzav dene waalon main shaamil ek varisht netaa ravat ke liye kehete hai, 'aakhir kab tak kisi vyakti ke saath anyaay hoga
 'by the way, the Rahul Gandhi camp against Rawat may be stuck because Rahul supporters were given ticket where rebel candidates are likely to win
 rajya ikai main ravat ke samarthak se zyada virdohi hai, jo lagaataar daawa kar rahe hai ki haridwar seat se loksabhaa upachunaav jeetna aasaan nahin hoga
 The same situation is with the claim of Vijay Bahuguna, MP from Tehri
 uttar pradesh congress adhyaksh reeta bahuguna joshi unki bahan hai, aise main uttarakhand main bhi brahman netritv ko badhaava dena congress ke liye sahaj nahin hoga
 But if the situation in Uttar Pradesh is not favorable, then the Congress can play the Brahmin card to cut Bhuvan Chandra Khanduri of BJP
 mukhyamantri pad ko lekar machi khinchataan main pradesh adhyaksh yashpal arya kaa daawa dalit or jeet kaa record acha hone kii vajah se behad majboot he
 As a Dalit, betting on Arya can be favorable for the Congress and Rahul Gandhi's National Mission-2014 in terms of strategic and social equations
 sutron ke mutabik, is pad ke liye zyada vivaad kii sthiti main tiwari or bahuguna bhi arya ko samarthan de sakate hai
 Leader of the Opposition Harak Singh Rawat has also mobilized for himself by camping in Delhi for a week
 ek anya daavedaar satpal maharaj ko rahul gandhi kaa najdiki mana jaataa he
 Apart from this, other contenders include former minister Indira Hridayesh, Amrita Rawat, wife of Satpal Maharaj, and Tiwari's special new morning

 In such a situation, if the Congress bets on a woman, then Amrita's name may come up
 ab yah dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki congress ke in daavedaaron main se kis kii lottery khulti he yaa koi or gumnaam cheharaa baaji maar letaa he
 But if the Congress does not form a government, Khanduri will return and the horse racing Congress will be forced to sleep long
 aaj kii taarikh main bhaajapa main mukhyamantri pad ke liye koi vivaad nahin he

 The park is decorated with pink stones from all sides

 But the question is that instead of putting 700 crore rupees in a park, hundreds of families could have got livelihood if they had been invested in the development of the public
 700 karod kaa park sunne main jitna acha lagata he dikhne main jitani shaano-shaukat he
 The equally big question is whether spending 700 crore rupees on a park is justified

 agar china ne bharat se yuddh ladane kii himakat kii, to usko buree tarah munh kii khaani padegi
 Well-known generals commanding the country's military security have calculated the entire strength of China and came to the conclusion that if China waged war, it would have to be defeated badly
 beshak yuddh ko hameshaa taala janaa chahie
 If someone considers war to be a joke, then his ego one day turns him into a joke
 bhartiya seemaa or sena par najar rakhane vaali mashhoor patrika indian military rivyuu ne likhaa ki 1962 kii jis jeet ko china seene se lagaakar bharat kii sahansheeltaa kii pariksha le rahaa he, uskaa silebus kabaka badal chukaa he or china apni sanak main na to ise samaj paa rahaa he or na hi is par soch paa rahaa he
 The Indian Military Review wrote that not only is China's preparedness weak, but it does not even have an expert general of war
 china ne bharat ke khilaaf saal 2016 se hi taiyaari shuru kar di thi
 By adding seven military zones, it had converted into five areas and made its commander, General Zhu Zhangqi
 janki kii tainaati 20 saal tak tibet main commander ke taur par rahi he
 Zangki alone knows how difficult it is to fight a war in areas adjacent to Bhutan, Sikkim and Arunachal? The rest of the Chinese army is badly confused
 indian military rivyuu ke mutabikchin or bharatki ladaai saal 2018 main hokar rahegi
 Both the countries have agreed to this and now only its announcement is left, but the big question is that if war happens, what will be the situation of India? How will we compete with China? Where will our own strength stand in front of its lethal war planes, missiles and fleets? As the Indian Military Review says, China is moving one step ahead on Doklamapar, but within it it is retreating two steps
 kyonki ek baar yuddh kaa elaan hone ke baad bharat kitne morche khol degaa, iskaa thik-thik andaja use bhi nahin he
 The Indian Military Review conceived that if 2018 was a war in India, what would it be? Where will our forces collide and what will be our strategy? According to General GD Bakshi, China will make its first foray into India from the Ladakh side
 ise cover dene ke liye pakistan kashmir main bade paimaane par yuddh viraam kaa ulanghan karegaa, jisase bharat kaa dhyaan bante
 For this, a large number of ammunition has already started collecting in China and border areas
 china doosraa morcha chumbi ghati main kholegaa
 In this area he will proceed using his heavy machine guns
 iske baad chini sena kii ek vishaal tukdi brahmaputra nadi paar karne kii koshish karegi or tabhi bhartiya vaayu sena apana oparation shuru kar degi
 India will strongly attack the troop passing through the Brahmaputra River
 china iskaa muqabla nahin kar paaegaa or phir yuddh kaa rukh badal jayega
 From where China will have no hope of resistance, it will have to face a tough struggle
 nateeja ye hoga ki tibet kii ore se kooch karne vaali tukdi ko lhasa main munh chhipaana padegaa

 rajdhani dilli main badhati bheedbhad or vaahanon kii badi taadaad ke chalate sadakon par jam laganaa aam baat he
 But now due to the jam on the roads, there is heavy traffic in the capital even on weekends as compared to the weekdays and the speed of the trains is very slow
 itnaa hi trephic jam kii vajah se dilli kii aabo-hawa bhi kaaphi khatarnaak ho gai
 The jam on the streets of the capital is increasing by 7 percent annually
 yah chaunkaane vaale aankade centre for science and enwyrement ne haal hi main google map ke jariye liye gaye data ke aadhaar par nikaalen hai
 The shocking things have come out in the study
 1
 The 13 roads of the Rajdhani that connect the areas with the main roads have reduced their average traffic speed by 50-60 percent from the scheduled speed
 2
 There is no peak hour on major roads now, as no difference in time taken for travel between peak and non peak hours was observed
 3
 Traffic speed and jam conditions in the weekend are worse than weekdays
 4
 Air pollution has increased due to traffic jams, nitrogen dioxide levels have risen by 38 percent
 5
 In contrast, the roads in Lutyens Delhi are time-saving and have better traffic speeds despite the lack of roads connecting the main roads in the peak and non-peak hours
 ab aapako bataate hai ki wo koun si sadaken hai jahaan logon ko rojaanaa trephic jam se jujhna padataa he

 Referring to another study done last year by CSE, it also said that the number of cars coming from NCR in the capital was more than the number of registered cars in Delhi in the year 2014-15
 study main jin 13 sadakon kaa zikr kiya gaya he unhen uniphid trephic and transportesan infrastracchar street dizin guidelins ke tahat urban rods ke anrtgat isliye banaaya gaya tha taaki inke jariye sadak par 50 se 70 kimi prati ghante kii driving speed hasil kii ja sake
 While the fixed speed was set at 40 to 55 km per hour
 lekin google map ke jariye kareeb ek maheene tak dilli kii in 13 sadakon ke speed ko objrv karne par maaloom padaa ki in sadakon par peak aavars par speed 26 kimi / ghanta or non peak owers par 27 kimi / ghanta he jo ki nirdhaarit speed se kareeb 50 se 60 fisad kam he
 In Delhi between 8 am and 8 pm, the speed of traffic is 25 to 30 km / h in about 12% of the time in 12 hours
 jabaki 17 fisadi samay ausatan speed 20 se 25 kimi / ghanta ke bich rahati he
 Only 8 percent of the occasions in the whole day come when the speed of traffic is 30 km / h or more
 kul milakar dekhen to peak owers main dilli kii ausatan raftaar kareeb 27
 7 km / h, then 30 in non-peak hours
 8 kimi / ghanta he
 IIT Madras has also done a study on the cost of jam on Delhi
 study ke mutabik saal 2013 main trephic jam se nipatane ke liye dilli kii laagat kareeb 54,000 karod rupee thi, jo ki saal 2030 tak kareeb 90,000 karod ho jaaegi
 Let us tell you that the number of vehicle registrations in Delhi has crossed one crore, in such a situation the situation is expected to get worse in the coming days

 aisi sambhaavna he ki sarkaar is baat ko dhyaan main rakhte hue bhaajapa ke samaksh niyam 193 ke tahat sansad main epadiai mudde par charchaa karaane kii peshkash karegi jisamen matdaan nahin hota he
 Lok Sabha Speaker Meira Kumar has called an all-party meeting on 21 November, a day before the winter session begins, wherein the issues to be discussed will be discussed
 sutron ne bataaya ki 18 saansadon ke saath samprag ke duusare sabase bade ghatak dal dramuk ne sarkaar se kaha he ki vah epadiai ke mahatvapurn mudde par sansad main matdaan se parhez kare
 The Prime Minister gave a dinner to the leaders of the UPA today ahead of the crucial winter session starting next week of Parliament, which is seen as an attempt to form a common strategy on various issues including FDI in retail
 vipaksh sansad main in muddon ko jorshor se uthaa saktaa he
 Leader of the House in Lok Sabha and Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde informed the leaders of constituent parties about the notices given by various parties under various rules
 pradhanmantri dwaara diye gayi is ratribhoj se pehle unhone sarkaar ko baahar se samarthan de rahe samaajawaadee party or basapa ke saath bhi baatcheet kii thi
 He hosted a dinner for SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav and his son Akhilesh last week and then invited BSP chief Mayawati for lunch on Sunday
 sarkaar ke bheetar ek mat yah bhi he ki 22 november se shuru ho rahe sheetakaaleen satr ke pehle do din koi kaarobaar nahin hogi
 But it is expected that a solution will be found and in the weeks that follow, the business will function normally
 samajha jaataa he ki aaj raatri bhoj main sansadeey kaary rajya mantri camel nath ne sahyogiyon ko bataaya ki is baat par gaur kiya ja rahaa he ki sarkaar ke karypalika aadesh ke paksh yaa virodh main laaye gayi kisi prastaav par sansad main matdaan ho saktaa he yaa nahin
 However, no constituent party specifically raised the issue of FDI
 shuukravaar ko ratribhoj main samprag adhyaksh sonia gandhi, raksha mantri e ke antni, vitt mantri pi chidambaram, grih mantri susheel kumaar scindia, dramuk ke tii aar baaluu, neshnal conferes ke faruk abdulla, rakanpa ke prafull patel, ralod ke ajit singh, indishan neshnal muslim lig ke i ahamed maujuud the
 The Prime Minister has been in touch with his constituents and allies because it may be possible that the government should vote on the proposal to be brought on the FDI issue
 avishvaas prastaav laaye jane kii bhi sambhaavna he
 The Left parties have put forward a proposal on which voting can be conducted on the issue of FDI
 mukhya vipakshi dal bhaajapa, uski sahyogi jadyu tathaa samprag se apana rasta alag karne vaali trinmul congress ne bhi notice diye hai
 Among those who have been given notices in the opposition are Shatabdi Rai of Trinamool, Ramesh Bains of BJP, AT Nana Patil, Hansraj Ahir and Rajiv Ranjan Singh of JDU
 sarkaar ke liye pareshaani kaa ek kaaran yah bhi he ki uske ek anya ghatak dal ne is mudde par apane pattey abhi tak nahin khole hai
 It is feared that the Trinamool Congress may bring a no-confidence motion
 dramuk pramukh em karunanidhi ne buudhvaar ko chennai main kaha tha ki epadiai mudde par unki party kaa ruukh ek ‘‘rahasy’’ bana hua he
 Asked whether the DMK would support a proposal by the Left and some other parties to vote in Parliament on the FDI issue, Karunanidhi said the party would decide its stand in consultation with members of its parliamentary party
 prastaav par matdaan kii sthiti main dramuk kaa sahyog samprag sarkaar ke liye behad mahatvapurn kyonki loksabhaa main 18 sadasyon ke saath vah samprag kaa doosraa sabase bada ghatak dal he
 The government currently has the support of 265 members including the DMK in the 545-member Lok Sabha
 samaajawaadee party ke 22 or basapa ke 21 sadasyon ke sahyog se uskaa sankhyabal 300 se thodaa upar chalaa jaataa he
 a lot of 273 votes are required in the Lok Sabha
 basapa or sapa ne abhi tak milakar yaa akele main aisa koi sanket nahin diya he ki ve sarkaar se samarthan waapas lene ja rahe hai
 Mayawati, who had indicated early elections, had not clearly stated her party's stand on the FDI issue after lunch with the Prime Minister
