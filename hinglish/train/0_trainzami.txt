'the data team of India Today, responsible for the intermediaries with the weather, studied data related to onion supply in two markets - lasalgaon and Pimpalgaon - considered to be the country's largest onion supply centers in Nashik
 2019 or 2018 ke disambar ke pehle hafte ke aankade bataate hai ki pyaaj kii aapurti 80 fisadi kam hi he
 Traders say that there is rain behind the supply of onions and that too, especially in November, the rain is more responsible for this
 data team ne maharashtra ke nasik jile ke 11 saal ke barsaat kaa aankada liya or yah dekhne kii koshish kii kya isse pehle bhi november main bemausam barsaat hui he
 If this has happened, has the supply of onions declined at that time
 mausam vibhaag ke aankade bataate hai ki november 2014 main 76 militre barish hui thi or isse zyada barish hui thi lekin pyaaj kii ausat aapurti 70 hajaar quintal se zyada thi
 Whereas in the month of November 2019, only 20 mm of rain fell and the supply of interest was reduced to 51 thousand quintals
 alvar se dilli main aane vaali pyaaj main kyon he tejimausam kii maar kii vajah bataakar satorie puure desh main baari munafa bator rahe hai
 This is not untouchable in the capital Delhi
 dilli main is samay sabase zyada aavak alvar ke pyaaj kii he
 Where onion is currently in stock
 lekin nasik kaa bahaanaa lekar alvar kii pyaaj bhi graahakon ko 120 rupye kilo bechi ja rahi he
 When interest from Alwar is coming to Delhi in the same amount, there can be no other reason for hoarding except selling onion at a higher price by linking it with the supply crisis of Nashik
 ajadpur mandi ke kaarobaari rajendra sharma jamkhori ko sire nakaar dete hai
 They say that this is only a rumor and the price has gone up due to unseasonal rains
 india today se baatcheet main sharma ne kaha ki 'baaris der se hui he or pyaaj kii aapurti par uskaa asar padaa he
 On the other hand, v Upadhyay, Professor of Economics at IIT Delhi, says that the current onion crisis is a handiwork especially for traders who are trying to earn profit by hoarding onions
 'dilli main jo pyaaj janvari main 656 rupye prati quintal par bechi ja rahi thi wo 5 disambar ko 5750 rupye prati quintal par pahunch gai
 India is the second largest onion producing country in the world after China
 desh main ausatan har saal kareeb 160 se 170 lakh ton (1451-1541 lakh quintal ) pyaaj yani duniya ke kul utpaadan kaa 20 fisadi utpaadan bharat main hota he
 The crop is grown exclusively in three cycles
 15 se 20 fisadi pyaaj kharif sijan main oktober se disambar ke dauraan aati he
 But 20-25 per cent, which is called Late Kharif season, comes in the market from January to March
 teesri khep rabi sijan main aati he jo takreeban kul salanaa utpaadan 50-60 fisadi hota he or march se may ke bich bazaar main aata he
 After the price skyrocketed, now the government exporting country is going to import onion
 sarkaar ne iran, turki or mishra se pyaaj aayaat karne kaa faisla kiya he
 The government's Food Minister Ram Vilas Paswan was asked a few days ago when the prices would be curbed, he replied that he is not an astrologer but that he would definitely say that onion prices started to decline till the end of November or the first week of December
 It will be done

 In the sixth phase, on May 12, all seven seats of the capital Delhi will be voted, due to which the veterans have given their full strength in the electoral riot of Delhi
 buudhvaar ko priyanka gandhi ne uttar purvi dilli se chunaav lard rahi shila dikshit ke saath road sho kiya vahiin piem modi ne dilli ke ramlila maidan main raily kii
 a few days ago, PM Modi had challenged that if the Congress has power, then it should be shown by contesting in the name of Rajiv Gandhi
 iskaa jawaab priyanka gandhi ne yah kahkar diya ki agar modi main dam he to vah aakhri 2 charnon kaa chunaav notebandi or jiesti ke naam par ladakar dikhaaen
 During the 5 year show of Modi vs 47 years of Delhi girl, Priyanka described herself as Delhi's daughter and asked Modi what do you know about Delhi
 modi ji dilli 5 saal pehle aae hai or maine 47 saal se dilli kii galiyaan dekhi hai
 Priyanka said that from Mehrauli to Majnu's mound, i know all of Delhi
 main dilli waalon ke dil kii baat bataati hum
 Priyanka's challenge on Modi's challenge, while promoting Shila Dixit, Priyanka Gandhi once again lashed out at PM Modi
 unhone piem modi kii us baat kaa bhi jawaab diya he ki jisamen modi ne congress ko rajeev gandhi naam par chunaav ladane kaa chalange diya tha
 Priyanka said that the last two phases of the election fight on demonetisation, fight on GST, fight on the safety of women and fight on the promises you made to the youth of the country and cheat on them
 118 siton par modi ko gherne kii kavayadapanch charnon ke chunaav ho gaye
 There are two elections left in which the fate of the candidates is to be decided in 118 seats
 pichley chunaav main bijepi ne in 118 siton me 77 siten jiti thim
 Now the challenge is to save them, then the opposition to break into it
 vipaksh tabhi sendhamari main kaamyaab ho saktaa he, jab bijepi ke star prachaarak yani piem narendra modi ko gherne main vah kaamyaab ho paaegaa
 Rahul and Priyanka have taken up this responsibility on behalf of the Congress
 pehle rahul sidhe piem modi par hamalaa bolte the
 Now Priyanka is also challenging PM Modi in her rallies, following the path of her brother
 dilli kii saat siton par sabase zyada focus12 may ko jin 59 siton par chunaav hone vaale hai, unpe pichhali baar bijepi ne 44, congress ne 2, tiemasi ne 8 or anya ne paanch siten jiti thi
 Of the 59 seats to be contested on May 19, BJP won 33 seats, Congress 3, TMC 9 and others 14 last time
 chhathwein charan main hi dilli kii sabhi saaton siton par chunaav hone hai
 Striving to make the fight BJP vs Congress, Priyanka tried her best to corner Modi in her roadshow
 unhone yah jataane kaa prayaas bhi kiya ki dilli main bijepi kii ladaai congress se he na ki aap se
 But Modi raised other questions in the rally after Priyanka's roadshow
 modi ne kaha ki un par aarope lagaaya jaataa he ki sena ko vah apni jaagir maanane lage hai, lekin modi ne sawaal kiya ki namdaar ke parivaar ne picnic manaane ke liye ienes viraat kaa taxi kii tarah istemaal kiya

 You call this course the abbreviation of FYUP
 takniki rup se yah nirdesh ujisi ne jari kiya he
 But politically it is also a part of bjp's Delhi manifesto that FYUP will be abolished as soon as it comes to power
 to ujisi ne ravivaar ke din bhi kaam karte hue diu ke principalon ko chitthee bheji ki is course ko samaapt kiijie or chaar saal kii jagah teen saal ke pathakram main admician lijie
 The UGC also printed a notice in the newspapers of Delhi, so that the general public can also become aware
 ujisi ko ab jaakar pataa chalaa he ki epaviupi naamak course rashtriya shiksha niti ke anukool nahin he
 To implement it in the year 2013, Delhi University Act 1922 was not followed
 jiske tahat course ke adhyadesh ko visitor yani raashtrapati kii anumati anivaary he
 At the same time, DU argues that the file for the President's permission was sent to the Ministry of Human Resources and as per the rule, if the President does not get a reply for a month, it is considered as permission
 ujisi ne apane aadesh main kaha he ki jo college iskaa paalan nahin karegaa, use ujisi act 1956 ke khilaaf mana jayega
 The UGC has formed a standing committee for what will be the way to go from four years to three years
 faisla yahi he ki mangalvaar ko cat of list nahin aegi
 On Monday, the principals of 66 colleges of Delhi University met in Khalsa College in which the decision was taken
 principal birdari kaa kahana he ki unke saamne diu or ujisi ke alag-alag aadesh hai
 Today there was a meeting with the UGC officials in the Ministry of Human Resources

 google ke gart main ek puraani khabar padi mili he, jisase saaf hota he ki ujisi pichley saal tak is course ko lagu karne main diu kii madad kar rahi thi
 Aarti Dhar, correspondent in The Hindu newspaper, dated June 5 and 2013, wrote that the UGC has constituted an advisory committee of five members to monitor and advise on the progress of the FYUP course being implemented in DU, SK Joshi, former Director General of Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) has been made
 samiti main tata institute of soshal science ke nideshak mrinal miri, indian istitut of advance studies ke purv nideshak es parasuraman jaise log hai
 The notification was then issued by UGC President Professor Ved Prakash that this committee of UGC would help and advise in implementing this move of DU
 isi 16 june ko diu ko likhe khat main ujisi ke nideshak kehete hai ki 25 farvari 2014 ko is salaahkaar samiti ne report di thi
 Accordingly, DU has not complied with the National Education Policy
 25 farvari ko report aati he or ujisi naam kii swytt sanstha maanav sansaadhan mantralay ke kisi bhi hastkshep se swatantra faisla leti he 20 june ko
 Why did UGC not take prompt action on this report for three and a half months? But this committee was also formed to help in the implementation of the course
 to kya janata ko yah bhi pataa chalegaa ki epaviupi ko lagu karaane main esake joshi cameti ne kya kya madad kii
 There has been controversy over the implementation process of FYUP, but what is the norm for removing it
 kathith rup se ek galat ko hataane ke liye kya ghoshit rup se ek or galat kaa sahaara liya ja saktaa he
 Is du's autonomy argument really strong? kya ujisi ke paas aisa karne kaa adhikaar he? 21veen sadi ke soshal media vaale paardarshee bharat main kaayade se in sansthaaon ke pramukhon ko press ke saamne aakar apana paksh rakhana chahie
 The UGC or SK Joshi committee should make it clear that FYUP was against 10 plus two plus three, so why did it take so long from June 2013 to 25 February to find out? Was the UGC under pressure from the government then or is it now

 The party's Rajya Sabha MP Naresh Aggarwal said the government should not withdraw the ordinance

 'if someone else in Rahul's place does not forgive him: NCPNCP leader Tariq Anwar said that if there was any other Congress leader other than Rahul Gandhi, the party would not have forgiven him, perhaps because of Rahul's opposition, the special cabinet a meeting has been called in which all the issues will be discussed
 ensipi ke hi ek or netaa deepi treepathi ne to congress ko gathbandhan dharm nibhaane kii salaah di

 'angry Hanuman' can be seen everywhere in the country on the bumper and wind shield of the vehicles
 iske rachanaakaar digital artist karan acharya ko pradhanmantri narendra modi mangalore main ek raily main desh kaa gaurav bataa chuke hai
 Acharya, a resident of Kasargod, a small town in Kerala, was known by far less people
 acharya ne ab ‘bhagwaan ram’kii ek tasviir banaai he
 In this picture, Lord Ram does not have a beard on his face but a beard
 soshal media par yah tasviir failane ke saath hi is par charchaa shuru ho gai he
 Acharya made this portrait of Lord Rama last month
 acharya ‘vector painting’yaa ‘digital painting’ kii vidha se potrate banaate hai
 According to Acharya, he was in two opinions about the emotion shown on the face of Lord Rama in the portrait
 pehle acharya ne bhagwaan ram ke chehre par dadhi dikhaai, kyonki ye unke mutabik swaabhaavik tha kyonki nirvaasan ke baad bhagwaan ram kai saal tak jangal main rahe
 Then Acharya felt that till now people have seen Lord Rama in the pictures without a beard and the same form has been created in his mind
 ye sochakar acharya ne potrate kaa ek or set banaaya
 According to Acharya, this time he did not show angry expressions like Hanuman's portrait on Lord Rama's face
 acharya ne kaha, ‘bhagwaan ram kaa cheharaa jab bhi koi dekhtaa he, uske man main shanti kaa bhav aata he
 According to Acharya, this time, the face he put in the portrait of Lord Rama, there is neither anger nor peace
 ye bhav in donon ke bich ke maane ja sakate hai
 Acharya's portrait on Hanuman can be seen on vehicles not only in India but also abroad
 acharya ke mutabik germany se unke ek parichit ne vaahan par potrate ko dekhne ke baad uski photo lekar unhen twit kiya
 Acharya's portrait poster made on Hanuman, sticker and various types of merchandise are overshadowed
 acharya kehete hai ki unhone sapane main bhi nahin sochaa tha ki unke banaae potrate ko har jagah aise haathon haath liya jayega
 Also, Acharya says that he did not get any special financial benefit from his creation
 acharya ke mutabik pehle wo copirite jaise daavon se anjaan the, isliye aisa koi aavedan bhi nahin kiya tha
 This is the reason why the portrait was used everywhere
 acharya ke anusaar unhen prasiddhi to mili lekin paisa nahin
 Acharya says that he has now applied the copyright for the portrait of Hanuman and hopes to get it soon
 acharya ne apane parijanon ke saath milakar ‘paridhi media works’ naam se company banaai he
 Acharya plans to use his art works in various merchandised such as T-shirts, posters

 Tiger Woods, which has been golf's biggest identity for at least the last decade and a half, now has a new relationship with India, and will remain as a brand ambassador for four years with the Indian motorcycle company Hero motocorp
 khelon kii duniya ke lihaaz se behad bade is qaraar ko karne vaale tiger woods ne isi saal bharat kaa daura kiya tha or uski yaaden unke man main ab bhi tazaa hai
 Interestingly, the announcement of the legendary American golfer to be the brand ambassador of Hero motocorp has been announced two days before the start of the prestigious PGA World Challenge, and it is notable that the tournament is hosted by the Tiger Woods Foundation and Hero motocorp Ltd
 Huh
 hero motocorp india ke chairman or prabandh nideshak pawan munjaal ne patrakaron se kaha, "ham hero world chalange se aage bad gaye hai or hamaare paas ab 1 disambar se agle chaar saal ke liye corporate saajheedaar ke rup main tiger woods honge

 He was also impressed by the popularity of his teammate Pawan Munjal, chairman and managing director of Hero motocorp Group, but Pawan Munjal says that everybody wanted to come to the other side of the rope to see Woods, so he gained more recognition
 Were living
 is tarah tiger woods paanchavin baar kambek kar rahe hai or vah bhi bade style se
 He is not fully game fit for the Hero World Challenge golf tournament, but is full of expectations as usual
 woods kehete hai ki vah kaaphi gend hit kar rahe hai or jamkar abhyaas kar rahe hai
 He admits that he is not as fit a game as he should be
 shaayad isliye bhi ki agast se lekar ab tak unhone koi toornament nahin khelaa he
 He says that this time of four months is a long time

 He says that Indian golf players have good talent
 unka maananaa he ki agar base bada hoga to kai achche khilaadi saamne aaenge

 is saal lagaataar chhathi baar repo rate main katautee hone kii ummid6 saal main repo rate main 2
 The cut of 85% has been done
 The results of the monetary policy review meeting chaired by RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das are going to come on Thursday
 aisi sambhaavna he ki kendriya bank dhimi padati arthvyavastha ko gati dene ke liye repo rate main ek baar or katautee kar saktaa he
 If the Reserve Bank does so, the repo rate will be cut for the sixth consecutive time this year
 haalanki arabiai kii ore se lagaataar katautee ke baad bhi bainkon kii ore se graahakon ko ummid ke mutabik phayda nahin pahunchaaya ja rahaa he
 If the banks implement this correctly then other types of loans, including home and auto loans, will become much cheaper
 aise main sawaal he ki aakhir kyon bank graahakon ko repo rate katautee kaa phayda nahin de rahe hai
 Let's understand the whole matter
 
 
 sabase pehle jaaniye kya he repo rate?repo rate vah dar hoti he, jis par bainkon ko arabiai karj detaa he
 Banks provide loans to customers on this basis
 repo rate kam hone se bainkon ko raahat milti he
 After the repo rate cut, banks are forced to reduce the interest rate
 arabiai har do maheene par hone vaali maudrik niti kii baithak main repo rate kii samiksha karata he
 The basis of the RBI review is mainly the inflation data and the condition of the economy
 agar arthvyavastha kii haalat thik nahin hoti he to repo rate main katautee kii sambhaavna bad jaati he
 2 in Modiraj
 85% gata repo retbite 6 saalon main repo rate kii baat karen to arabiai ne 2
 Has cut up to 85 percent
 janvari 2014 main repo rate 8 fisadi par tha
 Since then, the process of reduction in the repo rate has continued from time to time and this 5 in October 2019
 15 fisadi par pahunch gaya
 On the other hand, the Reserve Bank has only won five times this year
 35 kii katautee kar chukaa he
 While the country's largest public sector bank SBI has cut interest rate by 2 percent
 janvari 2014 main esbiai kii byaaj dar jahaan 10
 15 per cent, which has now come down to 8
 15 fisadi par aa gai he
 The appeal of the government and the RBI is also ineffective! The important thing is that despite repeated calls by the RBI and the government, banks have not benefited the customers according to the expectation
 beete 1 oktober se arabiai ne to bainkon ke liye sabhi nai floating daron ko repo rate se jodna anivaary kar diya tha
 Through this, customers were expected to get the direct benefit of the repo rate reduction
 lekin bainkon ne apane margin (munafa) main badhotaree kar di
 What is the mathematics of mortgage? For example, SBI has now increased its margin on new home loan, which is directly impacting your loan and you will have to pay more interest
 SBI ne apane margin ko pehle lagu 2
 Increased from 25 per cent to 2
 65 fisadi kar diya he
 Here, tell us that the interest rate levied on the loan by any bank includes the margin
 har bank apane hisaab se ise gata yaa badha sakate hai
 This is why repo rate 5
 15 fisadi hone ke baavjood byaaj kii dar 8 fisadi se adhik par hoti he or graahakon ko ummid ke mutabik phayda nahin mil paata he

 court ko lekar hindi filmon main dialog aksar sunai detaa he "taarikh par taarikh"
 But now surat-e-hall seems to be changing
 khaastaur se un court main jo supreme court ke aadesh par saansad or vidhayakon ke maamle sunne ke liye gathit kii gai hai
 There are 2 such special courts in Patiala House Court in Delhi
 yahaan zyaadaatar maamle aam aadmi party ke vidhayakon se jude hue hai or 22 main se 19 maamalon main court ne apana faisla 6 maheene se bhi kam samay main suna diya he
 The special court of Patiala House Court specially constituted in the cases against Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal to Congress President Rahul Gandhi is hearing the cases from March 1
 manahani ke kuch maamalon main to mukhyamantri kejariwal ne court ke baahar jaakar samjhauta kar cese khatm kar liye hai, vahiin kuch maamalon main unke vidhayakon ko court ne bari kar diya he or kuch main vidhayakon ko doshi bhi tehraaya gaya he
 Out of 22 cases going on against Aam Aadmi Party mlas, the court has pronounced its judgment in 19 cases
 isamen se kuch maamle chunaavon ke dauraan aachaar samhita kaa ulanghan karne, kuch marpet se jude hue or kuch bhrashtachar se jude hue hai
 Legal experts believe that if the court's decision comes early, then the public also gets to know whether the allegations against their leaders are true or false
 1 march se 31 july ke bich main special court ne netaaon se jude hue takreeban 144 maamle main sunwaayee kii
 In some cases, the case was terminated due to late filing of police charge sheet
 kuch main police saboot hi nahin juta pai
 And in some cases, the witnesses did not appear in the court
 aam aadmi party ke netaaon meservind kejarivalse lekar manish sisodiya, kailash gahalot or aasim ahamed khan jaise mantri bhi shaamil he jinako court ne bari karke raahat di he
 However, AAP mlas like Devendra Sehrawat and Sahiram Pahlavan have also been convicted by the court
 nae kanoon ke mutabik in logon ko agar 2 saal se upar kii sajaa hoti he to phir yah aage chunaav nahin lard sakate or saath hi inke vidhayaki bhi jaaegi
 Legal experts agree that there are many hurdles to finish the case within the time limit of 1 year
 kanoon visheshgy anil soni kehete he ki ab supreme court ne jo ki 1 saal ke bheetar hi sunwaayee puri karke apana faisla sunaane kaa aadesh diya he
 So the leaders' panic has increased and he is going out of the court and settling with witnesses to get acquitted somehow
 kyonki court main agar unhen doshi tehra diya to vah aage chunaav bhi nahin lard paaenge
 Investigation agencies like ED and CBI in corruption related cases take a long time to prove the money trail
 lekin agency se jude vakil kehete he ki ab 1 saal kii samay seemaa kii vajah se jaanch hadabadi main puri hogi, jisase cese kii jaanch or ahm pahalu court main sabit karne ke dauraan cese kamjor bhi ho saktaa he
 The accused can take advantage of it
 lekin itnaa tay he ki special court ke gathan ke baad netaaon se jude maamalon kii sunwaayee main teji ai he
 And now in such cases one does not have to wait six months for the next date

 Anyway, the image of the foreign minister, famous for helping every one seeking help, has always been a clean and hardworking politician, so this time he again reinforced his image not only by giving a brilliant answer, but also by all the politicians of the country from the general public Also urged to change the image
 
 
 tippaniyan This time a gentleman not only asked Sushma Swaraj to question whether you are real or not, but also tried to mock all politicians in the country by writing sarcasm in covert words
 
 
 @sushmaswaraj are you real? Just checking
 You don't meet the requirement of being Indian politician
 You are concerned about us(indians)

 And as usual, after the 'accurate' reply of the Foreign Minister, this time this gentleman too was forced to remain silent

 Due to Sushma Swaraj's image, there is no shortage of those who like her on Twitter, so many people praised her for this 'great' answer, but there were some people who disagreed with Sushma Swaraj this time
 It seemed important, because they believe that not all politicians can be sympathetic to the Indian foreign minister such as hardworking, noble and public

 3 janvari ko bachche kii maut ho gai thi
 He was buried in the cemetery around three o'clock that same evening

 Just before the upcoming Lok Sabha elections, a statement by Rashtrikakar and Janata Dal United national vice-president Prashant Kishor (prashant Kishor) can bring political shock
 jadyu ke rashtriya upaadhyaksh prashanth kishor ne kaha he ki vah bhaajapa ke saath dobaaraa gathjod karne ke apni party ke adhyaksh nitish kumaar ke tareeke se sahamat nahin hai or mahagathbandhan se nikalne ke baad bhagava party nit rajg main shaamil hone ke liye bihar ke mukhyamantri ko adarsh rup se nae sire se janadesh hasil karnaa chaiye tha
 Election strategist-turned-politician Kishore said this in an interview
 is bayaan se saaf he ki mahagathbandhan se naata todakar bijepi ke saath aane ke nitish kumaar ke faisle se prashanth kishor khush nahin hai
 Prashant Kishore's statement has angered his own party as the interview went viral on social media on Friday
 baharhaal, saakshaatkaar main kishor ne is baat ko rekhaankit kiya ki netaaon kaa paala badalanaa koi nayi baat nahin he
 He said, 'you look at parties like Chandrababu Naidu, Naveen Patnaik and DMK
 peeche kii ore dekhen to hamaare paas ve pi singh sarkaar kaa bhi udhaaharan he
 This was supported by both BJP and Left parties
 ''prashanth kishor ne kaha ki mahagathbandhan se july 2017 main alag hone kaa nitish kaa faisla sahi tha yaa nahin ise maapne kaa koi paimaana nahin he
 The Grand Alliance also included the RJD and the Congress
 unhone kaha, ‘jo log unamem (nitish) pradhanmantri narendra modi ko chunauti dene kii sambhaavna dekhte the, ve is kadam se niraash hue
 But those who were of the opinion that they started compromising with the regime in the enthusiasm to confront Modi, would feel right
 'us prakaran par tippanee karne ko kahe jane par prashanth kishor ne kaha, ‘bihar ke hiton ko dhyaan main rakhte hue meraa maananaa he ki yah sahi tha
 But i do not agree with the method adopted
 maine aisa pehle bhi kaha he or meri ab bhi yah raay he ki bhaajapa nit gathbandhan main lautne kaa faisla karne par unhen adarsh rup main nayaa janadesh hasil karnaa chaiye tha
 Prashant Kishore worked as an electoral strategist during the 2015 assembly elections
 us chunaav main nitish mahagathbandhan kii ore se mukhyamantri pad ke ummidavaar the
 The corruption charges against the younger son of RJD chief Lalu Prasad and the then Deputy Chief Minister of the state Tejashwi Yadav made Nitish uneasy and he finally resigned as Chief Minister
 lekip naatakeey ghatnakram main bhaajapa ke samarthan kar dene se unhone 24 ghante ke bheetar phir se mukhyamantri pad kii shapath le lee
 Reacting to Prashant Kishore's statement, RJD MLA and Bhai Virendra, the chief spokesperson of the party's Bihar unit, said, "the statement of the JD (U) national vice president is akin to accepting our allegations
" nitish ko mahagathbandhan ke ummidavaar ke taur par janadesh mila tha, jisamen rajd or congress bhi shaamil thi
 His move to enter the NDA without seeking a fresh mandate is like stabbing the back of the Grand Alliance
 'jad (you) parshad or party pravaktaa niraj kumaar ne kishor ko yah yaad dilaane kii koshish kii ki vah raajnneeti main abhi naye-naye aae hai
 Kishore was inducted into the party in September last year and was made the party's national vice-president a few weeks later
 niraj kumaar ne kaha, ‘unhone (kishor ne) jo kuch bhi bolaa usapar main kuch bhi tippanee nahin karnaa chahta hum, lekin main unhen aainaa dikhaanaa chaahunga
 ' aam aadmi party (aap) ke netaa manish sisodiya par aachaar samhita todane kaa aarope laga he

 Manish Sisodia was also found here along with many external workers of AAP during a search operation in a building in Lanka
 'aap' kaaryakarta to thane pahunche lekin manish bike par savaar hokar kisi or thikaane kii taraf chalate bane
 When the reporters wanted to talk to Manish, he did not talk
 'aap' ke ek kaaryakarta ne bataaya ki varanasi main kisi najdiki kii tabiyat kharaab hone se party kaaryakarta yahaan ruke hai
 In response to a question asked on the issue of Sisodia, Kejriwal said, 'sisodia was not doing any kind of election campaign
 party kaa netaa kisi ke ghar main ruk saktaa he
 'it is worth mentioning that under the ninth and last phase of the Lok Sabha elections, voting is being done in Varanasi today

 Congress has got bat in the assembly elections
 tino rajyon main party ke paas yaa to spasht bahumat he yaa party bahumat ke kaaphi kareeb he
 Congress NCP coalition has got mandate in Maharashtra
 arunachal main congress ne cliswip kiya he
 But in Haryana, the matter got a bit complicated
 yahaan 6 siton se congress bahumat se peeche rah gai
 However, within a few hours of the results, Chief Minister Hooda gathered the independents in his house and claimed that the key to power is in his hands
 hooda ne jutaya 6 nirdaleeyon kaa samarthanaharyana main satta kii siyasat garmaai hui he
 Independent MLA from Sirsa Gopal Kanda appeared with the police late Thursday evening
 khabaren ain unki giriftaar kii
 The Hooda government has started pressuring independents to support the noise in political corridors
 par kuch hi der baad nirdaleey vidhayak gopal kanda anya nirdaleey vidhayakon ke saath dilli main mukhyamantri bhupendra singh hooda ke ghar par dikhe
 Denied the news of the arrest and claimed to be with the Congress
 6 nirdaleeyon ko hooda ne apane ghar bula kar daawa kar diya ki ab satta kii chaabi unheen ke haath main he
 The results of Haryana which were confusing were the same as the results of Haryana
 kul 90 siton main congress ke hisse ai hai 40 siten
 INLD 31, Bhajanlal's son Kuldeep Vishnoi's party Haryana Janhit Congress won 6, BJP 4, BSP 1, other 1 and independents seven seats
 ieneldi ne kii vaapasineldi bhi congress se zyada peeche nahin thi
 Chautala contested for power with old colleagues, some independents and Kuldeep Bishnoi looking forward to him
 udhar, kuldeep vishnoi bhi khud ko kingmekar samajhane lage the
 The dream of becoming Deputy Chief Minister was also cherished
 congress ke saamne samarthan ke liye hooda ko hataane kii shart tak rakh di thi
 But within a few hours, by including independents in his field, Hooda did all the math in his favor
 madhya pradesh kii dimani vidhansabha seat ko paane ke liye is baar bijepi, basapa or congress ke bich kadi takkar he
 The seat is currently occupied by the BSP and the legislator is Balveer Singh Dandotia
 vaise to yah bijepi kii paramparaagat seat maani jaati he
 But the last time voters left the BJP
 1998 se lagaataar yahaan bijepi jeet rahi thi, lekin 2013 ke chunaav main basapa ne bada ulat pher kar diya
 This time the contest is considered to be between the BJP and Congress candidates
 donon hi dal takreeban baraabar sthiti main hai
 Due to lack of development work, people are angry with BSP
 pichley chunaav kii baat kii jaae to basapa ke baad congress duusare number par rahi thi or bijepi tisare number par thi
 Although the BJP is preparing from the booth level, it is difficult in front of the candidate
 kyonki party main tikat ke daavedaar adhik hai
 Secondly, Union Minister Narendra Singh Tomaraka also has good influence on this seat
 yadi ve iske liye thik se sakriy hue to bhaajapa ko laabh mil saktaa he
 The people of Tomar community are the most here, who play a decisive role in the elections
 iske alaava anusuchit jati va brahman matadaata ke vot bhi bada pherbadal kar sakate hai
 Akbaruddin Owaisi, the AIMIM leader who once called Prime Minister Narendra Modi the devil and the bloodthirsty, has now expressed his desire to support the Congress to wipe out the country

 vahiin, akbaruddin ke bayaan par palatwaar karte hue congress netaa hanumant raav ne kaha kibijapi or ovaisi bandhuon ke bichsanthganth chal rahi he
 Objectionable words were said during the Bihar elections that Akbaruddin Owaisi, brother of MIM Chief and Lok Sabha MP Asaduddin Owaisi, also used many offensive words against PM Modi during an election rally in Kishanganj, Bihar
 unhone gujarat main 2002 main hue dange ko lekar piem modi ko ‘shaitan’ or ‘jaalim’ tak kaha tha

 lekin jo log rojaanaa thodi-thodi sharaab pite hai, unamem iskaa khatra apekshaakrit kam hota he
 This has been claimed in a new study

 To reach this conclusion, the researchers compared 873 arthritis patients in a local hospital to 1004 people who did not have the disease
 shodhakartaaon ne in logon se poocha ki ve ek maheene main aamtaur par kitni baar sharaab pite hai
 Doctor James Maxwell states that arthritis symptoms were less severe in patients who regularly drank alcohol, but severe symptoms were found in patients who drank regularly or who had never tasted alcohol
 film kaa naam:ghayal vans agendiarector:sani deolster cast:sani deol ,soha ali khan, om puri, murali sharma,tiska chopra, narendra jha, sivam patil, dyna khan,anchal munjaivadhi:2 ghanta 08 minutesrtificate:u / aretimga:2 starsaal 1990 main ek blockbster film 'ghayal' relies hui or ab lagbhag 25 saal baad uski agali kisht banaai gai he, jise kabhi 'ghayal part 2', to kabhi 'ghayal riterns' kaha gaya or aakhirkaar mekars ne ise'ghayal vans agen'kaha
 Sunny Deol himself wrote, acted and also directed the film
 ab kya is film ko darshak usee jazbe ke saath dekhnaa pasand karenge jitna craij pehle relies hui film 'ghayal' ko lekar tha ? aaie jaanate hai aakhir kisi he sani deol kii film'ghayal vans agen
 Kahaaniyah is a story of a big controversy between a strong businessman Raj Bansal (narendra Jha) and Ajay Mehra (sunny Deol), the director of 'satyakam' media
 raaj bansal yuvaaon kii aawaaj ko dabaanaa chahta he or ajay mehara in yuva bacchon kii sachai ko har keemat par saamne laane kii koshish karata he
 The film also features ACP Joe d Souza (om Puri) and Riha (soha Ali Khan) who play key roles in the story as well as young children like Rishabh Arora (varun), Shivam Patil (rohan), Anushka ( Aanchal Munjal) and Zoya (diana Khan)
 ab kya ajay mehara sachai kii takat se buraaiyon kaa ant kar paaegaa? ise jaanane ke liye aapako film dekhni hogi
 The scriptfilm story is very simple
 yah ek achchhai or buraai ke bich kii jang he jo filmi parde par pichley lagbhag 6 dashakon se dikhaai ja rahi he
 The story is set in this century, in which flashbacks also feature moments from the film 'ghayal'
 ection or samvaad to hai lekin aisa koi dialog nahin he jo aapako bahut zyada prabhavit kare
 Efforts have been made to impart knowledge to the youth and there is an overdose of action, from train, car, bike to airplane, there is a lot of action, the script is also pulled
 yah film vaastaviktaa se kaaphi pare lagati he
 The four young actors, including Om Puri, Soha Ali Khan, Tisca Chopra, have played their roles well in the acting film
 sani deol bhi apane kirdaar main sahi najar aa rahe hai lekin zyada is role main zyada conect karte najar nahin aa rahe
 In the film, Narendra Jha has done a good job in the negative role, Narendra had earlier appeared in the film 'haider'
 film main damdaar ection ke liye diarectors ne bhi bakhubi kaam kiya he
 The music of the music film is fine and goes with the story
 khaas taur se becoground mujeec acha he
 Weak Link The weakest link is the script of the film which looks enlightening in the 21st century
 ise yuvaaon ke hisaab se or bhi jabardast likhaa ja saktaa tha
 The story faded amid so much good action
 haalanki single theatre ke darshakon ko film ke ection factor ko dekhne main jarur majaa aayega
 Why see Sunny Deol's fans, then definitely watch this film, otherwise save money

 Datta said, 'our experimental tests were successful
 ab ham apni praudyogiki kaa patent karaane ke liye aavedan dene par vichaar kar rahe hai
 'in the colors being sold in the market, heavy metals like zinc and mercury are added which can irritate the skin and cause blisters
 saans ke saath andar jane par in rangon se gurda, fefdon or yakrut main bhi samasya ho sakati he
 White gulal is also suitable for parents who do not allow their children to play Holi with water and dry colors for fear of health problems
 anusandhan kaa netritv karne vaale pro datta ne kaha, ‘bacchon kii twachaa bahut komal or samvedansheel hoti he isliye rangon main maujuud khatarnaak tatwon se unhen samasya hone kii ashanka hoti he

 It is also interesting to note that local residents and students have been playing this gulaal since long before Holi, because of its medicinal properties, university officials suggested so

 Although the rhythm of Team India's victory in Bengaluru may have been broken, but captain Virat Kohli feels that if the Indian team can replicate the domestic success even on the overseas grounds, then this current team will become one of the best ODI team

 Certainly one (gavaskar) feels good about getting this comment because he has seen many Indian teams in the last few years
 unhone kaha, ‘‘lekin yah yatra kaaphi lambii he kyonki yah team kaaphi yuva he

 xxrep 4 * kahaneh kabron kaa vilaap- khalil jibramir insaaf kii gaddi par baitha
 Scholars from his right-left country were seated
 unke chadhe hue chehron par kitabon kii chaaya khel rahi thi
 Soldiers held swords and neje stood nearby
 saamne log yah dekhne ke liye khadey the ki kis apradhi ko kya dand miltaa he
 Everybody's neck was bent
 aankhon main bebasii jhalak rahi thi
 And the breath stopped, as if Amir had such a force in his eyes, which was causing fear and grief on their hearts
 amir ne haath uthaaya or chillaakar kaha, ‘‘mulajimon ko ek-ek karke mere saamne hajir karo or bataao ki unamem se kisne kya kasoor kiya he ?’’kaidakhane kaa darwaja khol diya gaya or kaali deevaaren najar aane lageen
 Jangiro's clang started to be heard
 uske saath kaidiyon kii aah or ronaa-peetna bhi mila hua tha
 People started looking at them with their necks raised, as if they wanted to move ahead of each other in looking first at the victims of that death, taken out from the depths of that tomb
 thodi der baad kaidakhane se do sipaahi nikle, jinke kabje main ek noujvaan tha
 The young man had handcuffs in his hands, and his flared face and fearless face showed his self-respect and spiritual strength
 use sipaahiyon ne adaalat ke bich main khadaa kar diya or khud thodaa-sa peeche hokar khadey ho gayi
 Amir stared at them for a moment, then questioned, "this man, who stands before us in such a way as if not in the grip of the court, but standing on a high place, what crime has he committed?" "one of Amir's wizards replied," Yesterday a military officer and a few soldiers went to work in the countryside
 is aadmi ne afasar ko katl kar diya
 The soldiers arrested it and captured a blood stained sword
 ’’amir gusse se kaanpane laga
 The sparks of fire started pouring from his eyes
 usne garajati hui aawaaj main kaha, ‘‘ise zanjeeron main jakad do or phir usee andheri kothri main band kar do
 Yesterday morning, with its sword, blow its neck and throw its corpse out of the city, so that the vultures and eagles will take its meat and the wind can bring its smell to its family and its friends
 ’’noujvaan ko waapas kaidakhane ko le jaaya gaya
 The sad eyes of the people followed him, as he was still young and beautiful
 iske baad sipaahi ek aurat ko liye kaidakhane se nikle
 The woman was very beautiful and tender
 uski ankhon main dukh or niraashaa kaa peelaapan jhalak rahaa tha
 His eyes were getting low and his neck was bowed with shame
 amir ne us par nigaah daali or kaha, ‘‘is aurat ne jo hamaare saamne aise khadi he, jaise sach ke saamne chaaya, kya kasoor kiya he ?’’ek vajeer ne uttar diya, ‘‘yah aurat kulata he
 When Khavind came home at night, he saw that she was sleeping with her friend
 iskaa dost dar kar bhaag gaya or khavind ne ise police ke hawaale kar diya
 Amir was very upset to hear this
 stri shame ke maare pani-pani ho gai
 The rich said in a loud voice, "take it back to the prison and put it to sleep on a bed of thorns, so that it remembers the bed, which it made polluted by its sin, and drink it with the vinegar mixed with it, so that it will be in its home
" Remember to eat subah hone par ise nanga karke khinchate or ghasitate hue shahar ke baahar le jaao or sangsar kar do
 Let its corpse lie there, so that the wolf can eat its meat and lick its bones with insects
 ’’us aurat ko phir kaidakhane kii andheri kothri main le jaaya gaya
 People were looking at him with regret
 vah amir ke insaaf par khush the, lekin unhen us stri ke saundarya, komalta or uski duhkhi ankhon par bhi raham aa rahaa tha
 After this, two soldiers came with a weak middle-aged man, who used to walk on his knees shaking
 usne bheed kii taraf vyakul ankhon se dekha
 Innocence, waste and poverty were visible in his eyes
 amir ne us par nigaah daali or josh main aakar poocha, ‘‘is gande aadmi ne, jo is tarah khadaa he, jaise jindon main murda, kya kasoor kiya he ?’’vajeer ne jawaab diya, ‘‘yah chor he
 During the night it entered the Kalisa and the Jogis caught it

 a crowd of people dispersed and the place was empty, however the prisoners sigh and deep sighs were heard
 main vahaan khadaa is kanoon par hairaan ho rahaa tha, jo insaan ne insaan ke liye banaaya he
 i was looking at what people call justice
 sochate-sochate mere vichaar is tarah gaayab ho gayi, jis tarah shaam kii laali dhundhalake main chhip jaati he
 i left that house
 apane dil main kahata tha ki ghaas mitti se badhati he, bakrii ghaas ko kha leti he, bhediya bakrii ko apni khuraaq banaata he, ganda bhediya ko kha jaataa he or sher gande ko maut ke ghat utaarata he
 Does such a force exist, turn all these disgusting things into good results? Is there any force that takes all the forces of life into its hand and is soaking in itself - the way the sea covers all the rivers in its depth? Is there any force that can put the murderer and Maktool, the evil-doers and the evil-doers of the thief, and the one who was stolen here and in front of the posture of justice higher than the seat of the rich? i left the city and went to the fields, so that the mind would get some rest and the beautiful atmosphere of the forest would kill those creatures of sorrow and desperation, who bore me in the narrow streets and dark houses of the city
 Were new jis vakt ghati main pahunchaa to dekha ki gidhon, chilon or kauwon ke jhund ke jhund ud rahe hai jameen par utar rahe hai
 The sound of his voice and feet is trembling
 main jaraa aage badha to dekha ki mere saamne ek laash ped par latak rahi he or ek nangi aurat kii bejaan deh un pattharon ke dher main padi he, jinase use sangsar kiya gaya tha
 On the other hand, the body of a young man is covered with dust and blood, and his head is attached to the torso
 main vahiin thahar gaya
 a thick and dark curtain fell on my eyes, and i see nothing but imagination and death, which were covered in corpses laced with blood
 barbaadi kii pukaar ke alaava mere kaan kuch bhi nahin sunate the
 In this call, the voice of crows was also found, which were hovering around the victims of human law
 teen insaan kal tak jinda the, aaj subah maut ke munh main chale gayi
 The three men lost their allegiance to human existence, and the blind law stretched out their hands with impunity
 teen aadamiyon ko jail ne kasuurvaar tehraaya, kyonki ve kamjor the or kanoon ne unhen maut ke ghat utaar diya, kyonki vah taqatvar tha
 If one man killed the other, then he was a murderer; But when Amir murdered him, Amir was deemed to be a justice
 ek shaks ne puja kaa saamaan le liya to logon ne use chor kaha, lekin jab amir ne uski jindagi chin lee to vah amir vidwaan tehra
 When a woman was dishonest with her husband, people called her a kilt, but when Amir naked and got her to join her, she was called Amir Sharif

 We recompense Fussad with the worst Fuss and say that it is modesty

 What is the law? Who has seen him descending from the heights of the sky with the rays of the sun? And which man has found the digging desire mixed with the heart of man? And in which family the angels have come and told the people to bereft the weak with the light of life, blow the fallen with the sword and trample the man under the stubby feet? These thoughts were circulating in my mind And were bothering me so much that i heard the sound of someone's feet
 aankh uthaai to dekha ki ek aurat pedo main se nikalakar laashon ke kareeb aa rahi he
 Danger marks were visible on her face, as if she was scared to see that frightful sight
 vah us laash kii taraf badi, jiskaa sir qata hua tha or cheekh-chikhakar rone lagi
 With his trembling arms he hugged the corpse
 uski ankhon se aansuon kii jhadi lagi thi
 She was turning her fingers into the corpse's hair
 jab vah thak gai to usne apane haathon se jameen khodna shuru kiya, yahaan tak kii ek lambii chaudee kabr khod lee
 Then he took the young man's body and placed it in the tomb
 uskaa kataa hua or khun se lathpath sir uske kandhon par rakh diya or kabr ko mitti se dhankkar uske upar us talwaar ke fal ko gaad diya, jisase uskaa sir kaata gaya tha
 After this he said to me with tears, "tell Amir, instead of leaving the corpse of the man who freed me from the occupation of dishonor, it is better for me to eat the wild animals and birds
" That i die and meet the man
 ’’maine usase kaha, ‘‘o dukhi aurat, mujhase daro mat, kyonki main tumse pehle in maiyaton par vilaap kar chukaa hoon, lekin mujhe yah to bataao is aadmi ne tumhen beijjati ke kabje se kis tarah bachaaya tha ?’’usne tuutati hui aawaaj main jawaab diya, ‘‘amir kaa ek afasar hamaare kheton main lagaan or jajia vasuul karne aayaa tha; lekin jab usne mujhe dekha to uski niyat main badi aa gai
 After that he took out a huge amount of money towards my father and since my poor father could not pay this amount, that officer got angry and captured me in exchange for money, thinking that i reached the Amir's palace
 Give
 maine ro-rokar usase dayaa kii bheekh maangi, lekin use raham nahin aayaa
 i pleaded with him to pay attention to the father's old age, but he did not sweat
 tab maine chilla-chillaakar gaanvvaalon ko ikattha kiya or uske saamne fariyaad kii
 At that, the young man with whom i was engaged, came and he rescued me from the hands of the officer
 afasar ne gusse main aakar use katl kar dena chaha, lekin noujvaan furti ke saath apane ko bachaaya or diwaar se latakati hui puraani talwaar khinchakar usne apane upar ke hamale ke jawaab main or mere sharir ke bachaav ke liye afasar ko katl kar diya
 After this, he stood near Maktool's corpse for his honor
 aakhirkaar sipaahiyon ne use giraftaar karke kaidakhane main daal diya
 While saying this, he looked at me with a melting heart, then quickly turned back and walked away
 uski dardanaak aawaaj hawa main goonjati rahi
 After a while i saw a young man coming, who covered his face with a cloth
 vah vyabhichaarini kii laash ke paas pahunchakar ruk gaya
 He took off his shirt and covered the naked woman and started digging the ground with his dagger
 kabr taiyaar ho gai to usne us aurat ko usamen dafna diya
 When this work was completed, he plucked some flowers from here and there and made a bouquet of them and placed them on that grave
 jab vah jane laga to maine use roak liya or kaha, ‘‘is aurat ke saath tumhaara kya taalluk tha ki tumne amir kii ichha ke khilaaf or apni jindagi khatre main daalkar iske liye itani mehnat kii or isaki deh ko kauon or chilon kii khuraaq banane se bachaaya ?’’noujvaan ne meri taraf dekha uski ankhon se maaloom ho rahaa tha ki vah bahut royaa-dhoyaa he or usne sari raat jaagate hue bitaai he
 He said in a very sad and dispirited voice, "I am the unlucky man, because of which this poor thing was collected
" ham ek duusare ko tabhi se chaahate the, jabaki ham bachapan ke dinon main ikatthe khelaa karte the
 When we became young, our love also emerged completely
 ek baar jab main shahar chalaa gaya tha, ladki ke baap ne uski shaadi jabardastee kisi duusare aadmi ke saath kar di
 When i came back and heard this news, my life was covered in darkness and it became difficult for me to live
 main apni bhitari ichha ke saath bahut jhagadata rahaa, lekin parrast ho gaya
 My love took me in such a way that the one with eyes shows the path to the blind
 main chhipakar uske ghar pahunchaa, taaki uski ankhon kaa nur dekhuun or uski aawaaj kaa geet sunuun
 i found him alone
 vah apni kismat ko ro rahi thi or apni jindagi par afsos kar rahi thi
 i sat near her
 ham chaiyn se bate karne main magn ho gayi or khuda jaanata he ki hamaare dil paak the
 But when an hour passed, suddenly his khivind arrived
 usne jab mujhe dekha to vah gusse se pagal ho gaya
 He started making noise by putting a cloth around his woman's neck, people! come ! And look at this woman and her friend! Neighbors gathered and in a short time the policemen also came to get the news
 us aadmi ne apni aurat ko police ke sakht haathon main de diya, jo use ghasitate hue thane kii taraf le gayi
 But nobody even raised a hand on me, because blind law and dirty stereotypes follow the woman, every man is considered sorry
 ’’yah kahani sunaane ke baad noujvaan apana munh chipaaye shahar kii taraf chal diya or mujhe laash kii taraf dekhte hue chhod gaya, jo ped se latak rahi thi or hawa ke jhonkon se ped kii shakhaon ke saath hill rahi thi, maano vah ruhon se dayaa maang rahi ho, or chaahati ho ki use neeche utarkar jameen par insaaniyat ke premiyon or muhabbat ke shaheedon ke pahalu main daal diya jaay
 An hour later, a slim woman arrived, whose clothes were getting ragged
 vah ped se latakati hui laash ke kareeb aakar thahar gai or usne ro-petakar dil ko halkaa kiya
 She then climbed the tree and opened the silk rope with her teeth
 laash geele kapade kii tarah jameen par aa gai

 Internet users usually save passwords in web browsers so that it is easy to log in
 yujaranem, password, adress or duusari jaankariyaan jinaki jarurat kisi website ko log in karne main hota he ise broujar main seve kar dete hai
 But it can prove dangerous
 security researchrs ne browgers ke in bilt password manager main ek bag yani khami dhundhi he jo 11 saal puraani he
 Only through this, one can steal passwords and other information saved from your browser
 is maamle kii gambhirtha ye he ki havers kisi khatarnaak iraade ko anjaam dene ke liye bina aapke interaction ke passwords chura sakate hai
 Passwords can be stolen from which web browser: Google Chrome is the most popular web browser used on the desktop and saved passwords can also be stolen from it
 krom ke alaava mojila firefox or opera broujar bhi is khami kii vajah se prabhavit kiye ja sakate hai
 Reports have claimed that Microsoft's Edge browser is also not protected from this bug found in the password manager
 gauratlab he ki in sabhi web browgers main ek inbilt password manager hota he jahaan website kaa yuarel, yujaranem or password seve hote hai
 However, for this your browser asks for permission
 baad main ise acces karne ke liye aapako jimail kaa password yaa us broujar main kiye gaye log in kaa password dena hota he
 Who steals passwords saved in the browser? Some researchers at the Princeton Center for Information Technology Policy have found that two marketing companies named adthink and onaudiance interferes with inbuilt passwords given in the browser
 researchrs ne yah paaya he ki third party trekking script ke jariye ye websites webpej ke becoground main na dikhne vaala log in form inject karte hai
 This allows the browser based inbuilt password manager to steal the user's saved information like username and password
 kaise karen bachaav ?saadhaaran si baat he, agar aap kisi web broujar main password apanaayujaranem seve hi nahin karenge to kisibhi vigyaapan companiyon ke liye ise churaana mushkil hoga
 Not only this, there is another disadvantage of password saved in the browser, if you have left the browser open somewhere, then someone can take advantage of it wrongly
 isliye satark rahen or jahaan tak ho sake kisi bhi web broujar main password seve karne se bachein

 baad main jomato kii taraf se is vyakti ko karaara jawaab diya gaya
 First Jomato gave this reply from his Twitter account and later Jomato founder Dipendra Goyal also gave it
 jomato ne likhaa ki khaane kaa koi dharm nahin hota, khaanaa khud ek dharm he

 If there is any kind of loss to our business due to these values, we will not feel sad for it

 When the law is not obliged to sing the national anthem, not to hoist the tricolor, then how can it be in the tiffin
 rameshwar sharma ne kaha, hindustan kii media se prarthana he ki aap agar logon kaa mat le rahe hai to is batpar len ki kashmir main dhara 370 hate yaa naa hate? kashmir kii dharti par hindustan ke sainikon ke saath pathar phenkakar jo abhadrata kii ja rahi he us par raay lo
 Which tiffin will be eaten is not debatable
 yah to apni-apni ichha he ki koun kiske yahaan or kya khaataa he
 The BJP MLA said that if all this is to be done then uniform civil law should be brought so that everyone should follow each other's rules and religion
 unhone kaha ki kanoon kii baadhyataa jab raashtragan gane main lagu nahin hui, kanoon kii baadhyataa desh kaa tirangaa fahraane main lagu nahin hui, kanoon kii baadhyataa vande maataram gane main lagu nahin hui to kanoon kii baadhyataa tiffin khaane main kaise lagu ho sakati he
 Let me tell you that this incident is on Tuesday night, a customer named Amit Shukla ordered to eat Jomato in Jabalpur 
 jab shukla ne dekha ki khaanaa pahunchane aayaa vyakti gaiyr hindu he, to usne jomato se doosraa delivery boy bhejne ko kaha
 He told non-hindus not to take food due to the month of Shravan
 amit kaa chat soshal media khub viral ho rahaa he
 Shukla tweeted on Tuesday night, "I just canceled an order from Jomato
 unhone meraa khaanaa gaiyr-hindu vyakti ke haath bheja or kaha ki ve ise na to badal sakate hai or na hi order radd karne par paisa waapas kar sakate hai
 i said that you can't force me to take food
 mujhe paisa waapas nahin chahie, bas order radd karo
 "amit also shared a screenshot of Jomato's conversation with Customer Care and said he would consult his lawyer
 jomato ne is twit ke jawaab main likhaa, "khaane kaa koi dharm nahin hota he

 " India vs New Zealand: New Zealand defeated India by 4 runs in the decisive T20 match at Hamilton and won the series 2-1
 isi ke saath hi bharat kaa pehali baar is desh main dwipaksheeya tii-20 international siries jeetne kaa sapana bhi tut gaya
 Indian captain Rohit Sharma won the toss and called the Kiwi team to bat first, which proved to be a wrong decision
 newjiland ke ballebaajon ne tabadatod batting kar score 212 ran tak pahunchaa diya or match ko bharat se dur le gaye
 New Zealand bowlers then restricted India to 208 runs in 20 overs
 iske saath hi bharat kaa lagaataar 10 tii-20 siries se jari ajey abhiyaan bhi tham gaya
 India lost the last T20 series against the West Indies in 2017
 is haar ke baad soshal media par phens ne jamkar team india ke khilaadiyon kaa majaak banaaya he or unki aalochana kii he
 Due to these 5 reasons, India lost the hand, missed the opportunity to create history in T-20
 One thing has become clear today
 Dinesh Karthik is the match winner player

 BJP leaders Sudhanshu Trivedi and RP Singh said on Friday that Rahul Gandhi should not take the name of Guru Nanak Dev from his mouth
 kis munh se vah guru nanak dev kii soch ko apni soch bataa rahe hai
 He said that the Congress has a vision of its own who carried out the slaughter on the streets of Delhi in 1984
 arapy singh ne kaha, rahul gandhi ke is bayaan se sikh samudaay stabdh he ki kaise unki soch guru nanak dev kii soch se milti he
 Because the Congress has always been thinking of dividing the country
 congress kaa cheharaa dekhte hi 1984 ke narsanhaar kii yaad aati he
 i miss the politics of distribution in Punjab
 vah bayaan yaad aata he jisamen divangat rajeev gandhi ne indira gandhi kii hatya or sinkhon ke khilaaf hinsa par kaha tha ki agar bada ped girtaa he to dharti hilti he
 BJP spokesperson RP Singh said that from 1947 to 2018, the Congress worked to divide the country, whether it was in the name of religion, in the name of caste
 inaki raajnneeti sirf vot bantorne kii rahi he
 Earlier, Union Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqveen targeted the Congress
 rahul par palatwaar karte hue nakvi ne kaha, 'nadaan dost se aklmand dushman zyada acha hota he, lekin yah kahawat ulat gai he
 Now if fools are enemies, there can be no cure for them

 On comparing the Indian economy to China, the BJP leader said that Rahul should read the accounts of his party and his feudal family for 50 years
 jis parivaar kaa itihaas daagi ho, bhugol baagi ho, uske munh se isi tarah kii bhashaa or baaten niklengi
 The country has progressed under the leadership of Narendra Modi in 50 months
 desh kii arthvyavastha majboot hui he
 The person standing on the last rung has reached the light of promotion without discrimination
 yah baat kuch logon ko hajam nahin ho rahi he

 He said that BJP and Sangh are trying to divide the country, they are spreading hatred
 congress adhyaksh ne kaha, 'aaj desh main naukari kii nahin he, kisaan aatmahatya kar rahe hai
 We want everyone to develop
 unhone kaha ki aapane kabhi nahin suna hoga ki bhartiya hinsa kii baat karte hai
 Today there is a Congress government in Punjab, this government is yours
 ' The government and agencies have failed to check the pollution caused by vehicular pollution in the country's capital
 od ivan radd karne ke baad dilli sarkaar ke saamne kamjor public transport ko majboot karnaa ek sabase badi chunauti he
 Surprising figures show that in the last few years, concrete steps have not been taken to reduce the number of two-wheeler and 4-wheelers despite the ever increasing pollution inside the city

 dilli main cluster or ditisi bason kii sankhya lagbhag 5500 he
 Here the Aam Aadmi Party government has been able to increase 700 buses during its rule
 2
 Around 33 lakh passengers travel daily in these buses

 The problem of technical fault has become very common in the metro
 7
 The number of taxis in Delhi is more than 1 lakh, while the number of cng-run auto rickshaws is 85 thousand
 court aksar auto rickshaw kii sankhya ko 1 lakh tak badhaane kii baat bhi kah chukaa he
 8
 sirf ditisi bason kii baat karen to saal 2012-13 main har roj 46 lakh 77 hajaar log safar karte the
 In the year 2016, the number of people traveling by DTC buses everyday was 43 lakhs, but in 2017 this year the figure has been reduced to just 25 lakhs
 9
 At the same time, till the year 2015, about 28 lakh people used to travel in Delhi Metro

 10
 aankadon ke mutabik dilli main saal 2016 tak register hue tamaam vaahanon kii sankhya 1 karod se zyada he
 About 20 lakh people in Delhi use private vehicles except public transport, which is the biggest reason for the increase in pollution
 11 november ko engiti court main dipisisi ke adhikariyon ne court ko bataaya ki do pahiyaa or deazal gaadiyaan petrol kii gadiyon se zyada pradooshan karti hai
 Two-wheelers contribute about 30% of the total air pollution, which causes the most harmful gases
 aankadon ke mutabik dilli main 2 pahiyaa vaahanon kii sankhya 66 lakh or 4 pahiyaa vaahanon aankada 30 lakh ko paar kar chukaa he
 The condition of public transport is not only peaking at the level of DTC buses, but also no concrete steps have been taken regarding the metro
 iske liye centre or dilli donon sarkarein jimmedaar najar aati hai
