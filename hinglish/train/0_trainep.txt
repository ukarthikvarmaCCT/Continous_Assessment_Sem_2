 There is a ruckus in Parliament over the release of Masrat Alam
 sarkaar ke saath-saath pradhanmantri bhi baikfoot par hai
 The Prime Minister had to explain
 grahamantri kaa kahana he ki unki jammu kashmir ke mukhyamantri se koi baat bhi nahin hui
 The government is not able to give cleanliness in both houses
 congress netaa safuddin soz ne kaha ki masarrat alam ko saadhe chaar saal jail main rakhaa gaya, lekin uske kilaaf koi chargeshit daayar nahin hui
 No legal order was taken to keep him in jail
 aise kisi ko nahin rakh sakate
 The Home Minister should investigate the entire situation and come up with the facts, but the Congress has played the role of national opposition by opposing the release of Masrat Alam in Parliament
 iskaa matlab he ki kashmir kuch or sochataa he or baaki desh kuch or
 Those who know Kashmir believe that the rest of the country thinks less of the mind and more of the heart in the matter of Kashmir
 to kya ham kashmir ko lekar adhik bhaavnaatmak ho jate hai
 The release of Masrat Alam is not a case in point
 aise dheron maamle hai jo ab saamne aaengen
 It is now learned that the decision to leave Masrat Alam was taken during President Sasan, that is, the Union Home Ministry should be aware of it, especially the Kashmir cell
 pidipi kaa bayaan aayaa he ki raajnneetik kaidiyon kii rihaai ke maamle jammu-kashmir sarkaar adaalat ke faisle kaa paalan karegi
 That is, the Mufti government has put the ball in the court court
 adaalat ne bhi kaha hua he ki agar kaidi apni sajaa kaat chuke hai, to use reeha kiya ja saktaa he
 In such a situation, the next prisoner who is mentioned for release, his name is Faktu, who has been in jail for 22 years, that is, he has served his sentence
 ab sawaal yah uthta he ki mufti sarkaar yah sab kyon kar rahi he
 Why is he putting his one month old government in danger so soon
 kya vah bijepi ko chidhaa rahe hai
 The Mufti is an expert player in politics, the BJP will have to learn a lot from him
 mufti ne pehali baar congress ke saath mil kar sarkaar banaai thi or teen-teen saal sarkaar chalaane kaa vaayada kiya gaya tha, magar mufti ne gulam nabi aaazaad sarkaar se sarmathan vaapis le liya tha
 The Mufti released the Hurriyat leaders as soon as he became Chief Minister for the first time
 is baar bhi mukhyamantri banate hi mufti ne algaavvaadiyon ke saath-saath pakistan ko bhi safal chunaav ke liye dhanyavad diya
 It is also true that this time the separatists did not give any slogan of boycotting the election
 yahaan par mufti kaa shaatir dimag samaj main aata he
 The strategy of the Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir is that if the BJP withdraws support from the government on this issue, then the Mufti will want immediate elections
 mufti kii najar kashmir ghati ke 46 siton ke saath-saath jammu ke un 6 siton par he, jo muslim bahul hai
 Jammu Kashmir has a total of 87 seats
 mufti kaa algaavvadiyon or pakistan ko dhanyavad karne ke peeche bhi yahi ranneeti he ki vah un voton ko bhi apni ore karnaa chaahate hai jo in donon ke samarthak maane jate he
 This is a fact that we cannot deny
 vahiin bijepi kii najar jammu ke 37 siton par hai, yani raajnneeti donon ore se ho rahi he or faisla bijepi ko karnaa he ki vah baaki desh kii tarah sochna chaahati he yaa kashmir ke tarah
 Anyway, this is a mismatched marriage, it does not last for long
 bijepi jitna jaldi samarthan vaapis leti, utana unke liye acha hoga varanaa mufti sahab kii balle balle
 There has been such an incident of murder in Delhi that people will lose faith in friendship
 purvi dilli ke anand vihaar bas adde par ek vyakti ne apane dost kii mahaj is baat ke liye danda se peet-peet kar hatya kar di, kyonki usne apni jacket dene se inkaar kar diya tha

 balbir ne shakanr se apana jacket dene ko kaha
 But Shankar refused to give the jacket
 is par dono main jhagada shuru ho gaya
 Balbir Nejbaran tried to take off Shankar's jacket
 is par donon ke bich kaa jhagada hathapayee main badal gai
 All this was happening among hundreds of people
 is bich balbir ko paas main padaa hua ek danda dikhaa
 He picked up the stick and started beating his friend Shankar
 balbir danda se shankar ko tab tak peethta rahaa jab tak kii uski maut nahin ho gai
 On seeing Shankar dead, Balbir fled from the spot
 saream katlki baat sunakar police sakate main aa gai
 The police formed several teams to nab the killers
 thodi der baad hi aaropee balbir ko giraftaar kar liya gaya
 But the police were shocked when he was told by Balbir that he had killed his friend for the jacket
 gyaat ho ki dilli main adarsh nagar ilaake main do din pehle hi isi tarah kaa haroonges hatya kaa maamla saamne aayaa tha, jab andey ke paise maangane par ek shaks kii hatya kar di gai thi

 immunity ko majboot rakhane ke liye vitamin si bahut zyada jaruri he
 For which you must consume at least 60 to 90 grams of vitamin c a day
 5
 To stay healthy it is important that you sleep well in plenty
 isse aapaki immunity power to strang banati hi he saath hi tanaav bhi kam hota he
 Not only this, due to poor sleep, problems like flu and colds occur very quickly
 6
 Laughter is a very easy and necessary remedy for good health
 yun to hansane ke kai laabh hote hai
 Also, it has been revealed in many studies that people who watch comedy videos have more ability to fight against diseases caused by infection
 7
 Drinking hot water has many benefits for health
 subah khaali pet garm pani pine se vajan to kam hota hi he saath hi isse kai tarah ke flu se bhi bachaa ja saktaa he
 8
 rojaanaa workout karne kii aadat daal len
 Exercising regularly is very important for good health

 More than 150 hours of the Gaya Roadrage case have passed, but JDU MLA Manorama Devi is still far from the grip of Bihar Police
 gaya police kii esaiti beete 5 dinon se lagaataar chhapemari kar rahi he, lekin manorama ko pakadana to dur unka suraag tak nahin mil paa rahaa
 Police has raided till Jharkhand in search of Manorama
 sabake baavjood nateeja sifer rahaa he
 The police is being accused of wavering attitude In this case, from the very first day, the police have been accused of being wavering
 esaiti banane ke baavjood is hatyakand main ek bhi aaropee ko police khud nahin daboch pai
 Rocky Yadav, son of JDU MLA Manorama Devi and local Dabang Bindi Yadav associated with RJD, was handed over to police by Manorama himself under a deal
 iske baad doosraa aaropee tenni yadav bhi police suraksha ko dhata bataakar aasaani se gaya court main sarender kar gaya
 Son on the father's footsteps
 
 
 jaaniye, bindi yadav kaa kaala itihaas!police or esaiti ko is cese main aropiyon kii koi bhanak tak nahin lag rahi
 During this time, the biggest question remains that where is Manorama Devi? Many theories are being discussed at the moment regarding their concealment
 theory 1- naksaliyon kii suraksha main he manorama devipulice sutron kii maane to manorama devi gaya shahar ke aasapaas naksaliyon ke surakshit ilaake main he
 It is almost impossible for the police to enter those areas
 imamganj, mohanpur or barachatti ke jangalon ke kai gaanv naksaliyon ke maand kahe jate hai
 The police do not dare to go there even during the day
 gaya shahar se mahaj 45-60 kimi kii duuri par sthit in ilaakon main manorama chuphi ho sakati he
 Although the police has raided many places, but he has not been caught
 sabase zyada sambhaavna isi theory ke sach hone kii he
 Theory 2- The old place of Bindi Yadav in Jharkhand may be in the border area of jharkhand adjacent to Devi Gaya
 jharkhand ke hunterganj main bindi yadav kaa purana thikaana tha jahaan vah kai baar police se bachane ke liye chhip chukaa he
 In such a situation, the police is suspected to be hiding there too, but Manorama Devi did not enter the raid there on Saturday night
 police ko andeshaa he ki manorama usee ilaake main ab bhi ho sakati he
 Because that area belongs to Kallu Singh, Guru of Bindi Yadav
 uske saath milakar bindi ne itnaa bada samrajya khadaa kiya he
 Maybe Manorama has taken refuge there
 theory 3- sarender ke liye gaya shahar main hi thikanaek theory ke mutabikmanorma devigaya shahar ke bheetar hi kisi surakshit thikaane par ho dubkee ho sakati he, taaki jarurat padane par giraftaar ke bajaae wo turant sarender kar saken
 The police were informed of several such targets
 iske aadhaar par police ne bindi yadav ke bhai sheethal yadav ke ghar kii talaashi lee
 Manorama was not found there either
 aise kai ghar hai jahaan manorama aasaani se panaah le sakati hai
 Theory 4- Making pressure instead of arrest Police According to the Chauthi theory, the police is working on the principle of pressure on Manorama Devi instead of capturing her
 police ko maaloom he ki uske pati or bete jail ja chuke hai
 The government is in the process of acquiring their assets
 aise main manorama zyada dabaav nahin bardaasht nahin kar paaengi or jald hi police ke shikanje main hongi
 From Gaya to Patna, the police have kept silence in the Manorama Devi case, but now the police are not ready to even open their mouth on this matter
 gaya esaspi ne chuppi saadh lee he
 At the same time, top officials sitting in Patna are not thinking of any reply at the moment

" teen match se koi khilaadi kharaab nahin ho jaataa
 It is not that even after losing 5–0 to Australia, no good day will come in your career

 The Srikrishna Committee, formed for a detailed study on the issue of the formation of a separate Telangana state, outlined the six options Andhra Pradesh has maintained in its report as the best option
 samiti ke mutabik telugana rajya kaa gathan doosraa sabase acha vikalp he
 Political parties have clearly stated that they accept nothing less than a separate Telangana state
 kendriya grih mantri pi

 kya he report main, or kya he samiti kii raay:- kendriya grih mantralay kii website par guuruuvaar ko jari kii gai is report main jo chah vikalp sujhaaye gaye hai unamem pehla he vartmaan sthiti ko banaae rakhana
 The committee has stated in its unanimous view that it will not be practical to leave it as it is
 kuch hastkshep jaruri he
 According to the committee, this option was preferred by the least people
 samiti ne jo doosraa vikalp prastut kiya he usamen rajya ko simandhra or telugana main baantne kii baat he
 It talks about giving Union Territory status to Hyderabad and developing their own capitals in the times to come by both the regions
 samiti ne apni pratikriya main is vikalp ko avyaavhaarik bataaya he
 In the third option, the committee called for the division of the state into royal-telangana and Coastal Andhra, with Hyderabad being an integral part of royal-telangana
 samiti ne kaha he ki ise na to telugana samarthak or na hi sanyukt andhra samarthak sweekaar karenge
 According to the committee, this option will not be acceptable to the people of the three regions
 samiti ne apane chauthe vikalp main andhra pradesh ko simandhra or telugana main baantne ke saath hi vrihad hyderabad mahanagar ko pruthak centre shasit pradesh banaae jane kii baat kahi he

 The committee has said in its fifth option that the state be divided into Telangana and Seemandhra in view of the present border area
 hyderabad ko telugana kii rajdhani banaai jaae or simandhra kshetra apni nai rajdhani chune
 The committee said that this option could be considered
 uske mutabik telugana rajya kii maang main kuch dam he or yah puri tarah gairavaazib bhi nahin he
 After considering all aspects of this option, the committee has stated in its opinion that the formation of a separate Telangana state will make most of the people of the region feel satisfied but with it many problems will also arise
 samiti ne kaha he ki is vikalp ke nafe va nuksaan ko dekhte hue vah ise doosraa sarvshereshth vikalp samajhati he
 It is only when it becomes impossible to stop it and a peaceful consensus is reached between the people of the three regions
 samiti ne chathe or apane antim vikalp main rajya ko ekikrut banaae rakhane or telugana kshetra ke saamaajik or aarthik vikaas tathaa uske raajnneetik shashaktikaran ke liye use sanvaidhanik shaktiyaan muhaiyaa karaane tathaa sanvaidhanik shakti sampann telugana kshetreey parishad ke gathan kii baat kahi he

 In January 2018, Bhima Koregaon in Maharashtra was engulfed by the first government order to withdraw the case: Uddhavnist Congress Party (NCP) leader Dhananjay Munde has demanded the withdrawal of all the cases registered in the Bhima Koregaon violence case
 isko lekar unhone maharashtra ke mukhyamantri uddhav thakare ko khat likhaa he, jisamen kaha gaya ki bhima koregaanv main hui hinsa maamle main darj sabhi cese waapas liye jaaen
 Earlier, the Uddhav Thackeray government had withdrawn the cases filed in the Nanar refinery and Aarey case
 ensipi netaa dhananjay munde ne siem uddhav thakare se kaha ki bhima koregaanv maamle main urban naksal bataakar logon ke khilaaf jhootha cese darj kiya gaya tha
 So all the cases should be withdrawn
 haalanki is maamle main chargeshit pehle hi daakhil ho chuki he
 Munde said that fake cases were filed against him in the Bhima Koregaon violence case by calling intellectuals, social workers and citizens as Naxalites
 dhananjay munde ke alaava ensipi netaa prakaash gajabhiye ne bhi mukhyamantri uddhav thakare ko khat likhakar bhima koregaanv maamle main darj cese waapas lene kii maang kii he
 Uddhav said - Fadnavis government had ordered the withdrawal of the case
 Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray said that the Fadnavis government had ordered the withdrawal of the case registered in the Bhima Koregaon violence case
 ab ham is par pehle vichaar karenge
 What was the whole matter? Let me tell you that on January 1, 2018, caste violence broke out in Bhima Koregaon, Maharashtra
 iske maamle main police ne kai logon ko giraftaar kiya tha
 In this case, the police also accused Surendra, Gadling, Sudhir Dhawale, Mahesh Raut, Roma Wilson and Soma Sen
 jab bhima koregaanv main hinsa hui thi, us samaymaharashtramen bhartiya janata party (bijepi) or shivasena ke gathbandhan vaali sarkaar thi
 After the Maharashtra assembly elections, there was a rift between the BJP and Shiv Sena for the post of Chief Minister, after which the two parties split up
 bijepi se alag hone ke baad shivasena ne ensipi or congress ke saath milakar maharashtra main sarkaar bana lee he
 The NCP did not have a stake in the state government at the time of the Bhima Koregaon violence, but now the NCP is in power along with the Shiv Sena and the Congress

 The opposition has become an aggressor against the government after the release of RBI data on old notes returned to the banking system after demonetisation
 vipaksh shuru se hi sarkaar ke notebandi ke kadam kii aalochana karata rahaa he or ab aankade jari hone ke baad use sarkaar par hamale kaa phir se mauka mil gaya he
 The opposition is calling demonetisation a completely flop show
 india today ke kansalting editor rajdeep saradesise khaas baatcheet main purv kendriya mantripi chidambaramane centre sarkaar ke is daawey ko puri tarah khaarij kiya ki notebandi safal rahi he
 He also tried to air the government's claim that the original purpose of demonetisation was to promote cashless economy in the country
 pesh hai is intervyuu ke khaas ansh
 
 
 Question: The Reserve Bank's report and data on demonetisation have created a political ruckus according to estimates
 vipaksh ise is baat kaa saboot bataa rahaa he ki notebandi asafal rahi he
 You were the one who spoke most harshly and unhesitatingly about this
 aapane kai twit kar yah kaha tha ki notebandi lagaataar jari rahane vaali aapadaa he
 Did your reaction become a bit redundant because of the fact that you are in opposition? Answer: First thing i would say that you should not call it harshness
 maine tathyon ke aadhaar par baat kahi thi or tathyon se mili nishkarsh sarkaar dwaara or pradhanmantri dwaara bataae gaye teen uddeshyon ke bilkul vipareet jate hai
 Question: But what is the meaning of the words you have used in your tweet? Answer: They are statements based on facts
 unka har shabd sahi he
 99% notes legally exchanged! Was demonetisation a scheme designed to convert black money into white? - p
 Chidambaram (@pchidambaram_in)august 30, 2017sawaal: lekin aapaki pratikriya kuch atirek nahin he? jab sarkaar yah daawa kar rahi he ki gilaas aadha bharaa hua he
 Arun Jaitley says that this is a big step towards formalization of the economy and it should not be weighed down only by the return of notes
 jawaab: lekin yah uddeshy to unhone khud tay kiya tha
 This was one of three objectives
 tab atorni general ne supreme court ko bataaya tha ki sarkaar ko aisa lagata he ki 4-5 lakh karod rigerv bank main waapas nahin aaenge or isse sarkaar ko phayda hoga
 Black money increased due to demonetisation! Question: The newly appointed Deputy Chairman of NITI Aayog, Rajiv Kumar has said that no matter whether black money flowed or not, look at its reserves
 sarkaar ne system main maujuud kaale dhan ke daldal par prahaar kiya he
 Kumar said that contrary to Chidambaram's thinking that black money has become white, the truth is that black money is now gray and the Income Tax Department and ED can easily target it
 jawaab: main aise vyakti par tippanee nahin karnaa chahta jo abhi haal main niyukt hua he
 Three days after he took office, the government rejected the NITI Aayog report
 sarkaar kaa uddeshy kaale dhan ke bhandar par chot karne kaa tha
 But the fact is that we have always been saying that demonetisation will not hurt this store, but will create more black money
 isse sirf us 3-4 lakh karod ke bhandar par chot hogi, jo ki system main na aayaa ho
 But this means that whoever has the black money will find a way to convert it into white money
 isiilie main is par sawaal uthaata rahaa
 It seems that it was brought to help those who converted black money into white money
 sawaal: sarkaar kaa to yah kahana he ki ab unhen vastav main yah pataa chal gaya he ki system main kin khaaton menkla dhanjama hua he or is tarah ab vah aise logon ko dandit kar sakati he or unke naam kaa khulaasa kar sakati he
 Answer: Let's ask the government a question and take an answer
 sarkaar kaa yah daawa he ki kareeb 16,000 karod rupee ke kaale dhan kii pahchaan hui he or kareeb 1,000 karod rupee kii nakadi jabt kii gai he
 Now look at the records of the Income Tax Department of previous years
 har saal iskar vibhaag yah bataata he ki usne itane hajaar karod aghoshit aay kaa pataa lagaaya he or 500-1000 karod jabt kiye hai
 The figure is almost the same
 isamen kuch bhi nayaa nahin he
 Not only this, these figures are not even final
 iske baad bhi logon ko apil karne kaa mauka miltaa he
 Only after the final decision is made in these appeals, it is known how much tax and how much black money is in the cash seized by the Income Tax Department
 iskar vibhaag kii jabti ke aadhaar par kisi nishkarsh par nahin pahunchaa ja saktaa
 i have seen for 10 years that the Income Tax Department makes such claims every year
 lenden par najar rakhane ke or bhi tareeke hanswaal: to aap sarkaar ke is tark ko sweekaar karne ke liye taiyaar nahin hai ki ab khaataa dharakon kii pahchaan kii ja sakati he
 Account holders of about Rs 3 lakh crore are under investigation? Answer: Such account holders have always been under scrutiny
 udhaaharan ke liye jab maine cash tranjaction tex kii shuruyaat kii thi, to iske peeche bhi iraadaa yah tha ki nakadi jamaa karne yaa nikaalane vaale logon par najar rakhi ja sake
 We found many people against whom action was taken
 jab hamane suspected tranjaction reporting kii shuruyaat kii, tab bhi hamen bahut se logon ke bare main pataa chalaa
 There are many ways to monitor people
 yah daawa nahin kiya ja saktaa ki notebandi logon par najar rakhane kaa tarika he
 No way of demonetisation for fake notes
 Question: The government will also boast about one of its objectives to curb fake notes, even if it has happened very little (
 xxrep 4 0 8 fisadi)
 At least some effort was made in this direction
 jawaab: enie ne kolkata kii ek sanstha ke saath milakar pataa lagaaya he ki kul nakli note 400 karod rupee ke hai
 Most countries change the design of their notes every two or three years and try to deal with fake notes
 iske liye noton main nae feechar shaamil kiye jate hai or ek nirdhaarit tithi se pehle ke noton ko amaanya ghoshit kar diya jaataa he
 This has been done before also and this path should be adopted further
 nakli noton se nipatane ke liye notebandi nahin kii jaati
 Apart from this, see also that 2000 fake notes have also arrived
 is par sarkaar kya jawaab degi?teror funding par ankush nahinswaal: aap purv grih mantri bhi rahe hai or maujuuda sarkaar kaa yah daawa bhi he ki notebandi seatankiyon kifending par ankush laga he
 The government claims that demonetisation has reduced Naxalite incidents and has strangled the terror funding to some extent
 jawaab: chaliye aatanki ghatnaon kaa udhaaharan lete hai
 i have some figures
 kashmir kii baat karte hai jahaan aatankwaad or teror funding charam par rahaa he
 Terrorism deaths in 2007 are higher than in 2016
 ghatnaon kii sankhya, nagarikon or sainikon ke maare jane, sabhi lihaaj se yah zyada hua he
 Therefore, if we assume that terrorism in Kashmir is being nurtured by black money or fake currency, then there is no success in this objective of demonetisation
 sawaal: naksali ghatnaon par kya kahenge?jawaab: saal 2009 se hi naksali ghatnaon main kami aa rahi he
 i had success in it
 yah giravat jari he kyonki yah sarkaar pichhali sarkaar kii hi nitiyon par chal rahi he
 For this i do not get irritated by them, rather i appreciate them
 lekin kripaya ise notebandi se na joden
 Question: The government also claims that demonetisation has led to cashless economy, digitization of the economy, digital transactions have increased by 20%? Answer: This was not the price objective of demonetisation
 electronic bhugtan main khaas badhat nahinswaal: to kya aap sarkaar par yah aarope laga rahe hai ki sarkaar ne apana lakshya badal liya he?jawaab: tathyon par gaur karen
 Non-cash or electronic payments amounted to Rs 94 lakh crore in November 2016
 notebandi ke chah maheene baad may 2017 main yah 94
 21 lakh crores
 isliye is baat kaa koi pramaan nahin he ki gaiyr nakadi lenden main koi bahut tej oochaal aayaa ho
 Even now, cash is the main method of transaction in this country
 digital tranjaction kaa badhanaa acchhee baat he
 The truth is that i also support the digitization of transactions
 lekin yah kehane se pehle ki notebandi se tranjaction main digitigeshan ko badhaava miltaa he, is par bhi gaur kariye ki lakhon log dhoop or barish main line main khadey rahe, 104 logon kii maut ho gai
 Many small and medium enterprises were ruined
 15 lakh naukariyaan khatm ho gayi
 The economy ranged from 7-8 percent to 6-7 percent
 kya sarkaar yah kah sakati he ki in sabhi sankaton kaa jawaab digitigeshan he?rajyon ke chunaav main notebandi nahin tha masalasawaal: november 2016 ke baad se lagbhag har chunaav main bijepi ko jeet mili he
 So, from the political point of view, even after paying the social, economic and human cost, people are recognizing the ban on demonetisation
 Answer: How easily does the media also get deceived
 paanch rajyon ke chunaav ek hi samay (march main) hue
 BJP got a landslide victory in UP
 isliye aap is nishkarsh par pahunch gaye ki logon ne notebandi ke samarthan main vot kiya he
 But at the same time, the people of Punjab rejected the BJP badly
 to aap punjab ke bare main kya nishkarsh nikaalenge? goa or manipur main logon ne bijepi ko duusare sthaan par dhakel diya
 So would you say that half the people have supported the demonetisation
 main samajhataa hum ki ye sab saral tareeke ke nishkarsh hai
 No state election is contested on these issues
 notebandi ke sahi yaa galat hone kaa aadhaar arthvyavastha ke alaava kisi or cheez ko nahin banaaya ja saktaa
 Question: But one thinking is that UPA or Congress party made very little effort to deal with black money
 ab kaale dhan par chot karne kaa vaada karke ai endie sarkaar kuch to kar rahi he
 Now, instead of praising the government for this courage, the opposition is supporting maintaining the status quo and wants to keep black money in the economy
 jawaab: yah phir ek galat baat he
 It is still the income tax department
 jo pehle diarector the ab chif visilence kamishnar hai
 You should ask the government to publish the figures for every year since 1999 (even during the tenures of Vajpayee and Manmohan Singh)
 isamen sarkaar iskar vibhaag ke chhaapon, jabti, bina hisaab-kitaab vaale aamadani, kitne maamalon main abhiyog chalaae gaye, kitna tex lagaaya gaya, in sabaki puri jaankaree de
 So you will see that the figures are almost the same from year to year
 notebandi samasyaon kaa samaadhaan nahin haisawaal: aapke hisaab se aakhir rasta kya he?jawaab: is baat ko kripaya samaj len, ki bharat kaa aarthik or kar dhaancha bahut bahut hi vilakshan he
 Nearly half of the population here has legitimately tax-free income - such as farmers, religious institutions, religious trusts, charities, people living in the Northeast, tribals etc
 iske saath hi ek badi jansankhya vaid rup se tex dene vaali bhi he
 As long as it is a dual-structure economy, the flow of money from one structure to another will continue continuously
 udhaaharan ke liye 2000 kaa ek note din bhar main 20 baar ek haath se duusare haath tak jaataa he, yah safed yaa kaala dhan ho saktaa he
 Therefore, the solution is to encourage more people to pay tax by keeping lower rates of tax
 yah main 1997 main kar chukaa he
 This test should be done for 20 years
 tex kii daren kam ho, kar prashasan zyada maitreepurn ho to log tex dene or ritern file karne ke liye protsaahit hote hai
 Apart from this, cash transaction tax, reporting suspicious transactions, third party reporting etc
 are means to monitor the transactions
 isliye sarkaar ko duusare sadhano par vichaar karnaa chahie
 Demonetization is not a solution
 maamuli tex dene waalon kaa hi base badha haisawaal: sarkaar kaa to yah bhi kahana he ki ab kar dene waalon dayera badha he or yah bhi notebandi kaa nateeja he?jawaab: aap media ke log sarkaar se sawaal nahin karte
 You are afraid to question the government
 aap unase sawaal puuchhen
 The tax base has increased every year in the last 15 years
 haa, is saal tex base main thodi acchhee badhat hui he, lekin jo ritern daakhil hue hai unamem ausat texable inakam 2
 7 lakh rupees only, which is only slightly more than the tax exemption limit
 isliye unase vasula jane vaala iskar bhi bahut thodaa hi hoga
 You ask the government to disclose that how many people who file returns are not taxed
 political funding par prahaar kaa swagatsawaal: sarkaar to yah bhi daawa kar rahi he ki notebandi se real estate jaise mahatvapurn kshetron main kaale dhan par ankush laga he or vitt mantri ne kaha he ki sarkaar kaa aglaa nishaanaa raajnneetik funding he
 Answer: Hey let them do it
 hamen koi dikkat nahin
 BJP has received the highest donation of Rs 707 crore in the last three years
 ve political funding ko nishaanaa banaaen, isamen kuch bhi galat nahin he
 There are many other sectors of the economy in which black money thrives
 jaise nirmaan kshetra, film industry, shikshan sansthaaon main capitesan fees ke rup main, prashasan main bhrashtachar, raajnneetik funding aadi
 There are so many political rallies, they can claim that all the money spent in the rally has been paid by check
 chunaav main itnaa kaala dhan kharch hota he
 How will we stop black money from flourishing in all these sectors? The Governor of the Reserve Bank is responsible! Question: In view of this sharp criticism of you, let us say who can be responsible for whatever is going wrong in your account - Reserve Bank Governor or Chief Economic Advisor to the government
 jawaab: main nahin samajhataa ki notebandi ke liye mukhya aarthik salaahkaar ne salaah di thi yaa uskaa samarthan kiya tha
 After receiving a letter on 7 November, the Governor of the Reserve Bank of India was in a hurry and suggested it on 8 November
 mere hisaab se unhen aisa nahin karnaa chahie tha
 i think they must have got a lesson
 sawaal: manmohan singh ne ise sangathit lut or chori bataaya tha
 Answer: They called it unprecedented mismanagement
 jo ki bilkul sahi baat he
 This thing has been proved
 jab aisa lagata he ki kaale dhan kaa bhandar rakhane vaale har vyakti ne use safed kara liya he to ise arthvyavastha main lut hi kahenge

 Alberta was considered a stronghold of Prime Minister Stephen Harper and his Conservative Party, but these election results have provided a different picture
 fedral conservative ke ek netaa deepak obray kaa kahana he ki koi bhi surakshit seat ab surakshit nahin bachi he
 The Conservative Party holds 26 of Alberta's 28 federal seats
 kanoon mantri peter maikey ne buudhvaar ko hui conservative party kii meeting ko 'murdaghar' jaisaa qaraar diya

 iske baad jab piem modi gujarat gaye to unhone apane bhaashanon main'main gujarat hum, main vikaas hum'naare kaa istemaal kiya
 Rahul Gandhi said that when PM Modi described himself as development, he wrote this connection to Gujarat Congress in-charge Ashok Gehlot and asked him to maintain the dignity of the Prime Minister's post
 rahul ne kaha, 'maine pradhanmantri pad kaa apmaan na karne ke nirdesh die

 kabhi usne kaha ki kisi ne uski patni ko maar daalaa
 So sometimes he said that his death was natural

 isi dauraan mritka kaa pati aspataal se achaanak gaayab ho gaya
 The police kept searching for him

 The police searched him not only in Gujarat but also in the surrounding states

 The police stopped searching for Nemritka's husband
 lekin cese band nahin kiya
 Meanwhile, after 15 years, suddenly the Gujarat Police got information that Tarun, husband of deceased Sajni: Police searched for him in many states to arrest Tarun, but could not find any whereabouts
 haal main police ko jaankaree mili ki tarun apana naam badalakar bengalooru main rah rahaa he
 The crime branch came to know that Tarun has also remarried

 These panels are producing clean energy

 Among the electrification of villages, this is one of the biggest projects of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's electrification of rural areas
 lekin urja kii baari laagat is disha main munh baae khadi sabase badi baadha he
 India is still dependent on traditional energy sources such as coal, oil and gas (since that energy is not clean either)
 is desh ke 30 karod se zyada logon kii abhi bhi bijli tak pahunch nahin he
 In this context, solar energy is considered as a long-term and sustainable measure of clean electricity
 disambar, 2015 main yojit paris jalwaayu sammelan main pradhanmantri ke 'surya namaskara' kaa puraa duniya ne swaagat kiya tha, jahaan unhone 120 deshon ko milakar international solar alliance (iesa) banane kaa elaan kiya tha
 In Paris, he said, "solar (energy) is the sunrise of new hope

 India announced the target of generating 100 GW of electricity from various sources of renewable energy by 2022
 (30 april, 2016 tak bharat kii kul kshamta 42
 8 GW)
 paris sammelan ke baad desh main saura urja kii pariyojnaon ko zyada protsaahan mila he kyonki badi sankhya main nai companiyon ne is kshetra main pravesh kiya he
 Tarun Kapoor, joint secretary in the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, says, "the significant incentive for solar energy has come through the amendment in the tariff policy as it will convince distribution companies to buy electricity

 Per unit, which is equal to coal produced power and its biggest advantage is that this charge is not dependent on market fluctuations
 agle 25 saal tak bhi yah shulk itnaa hi rahegaa, jisase niveshkon ke aatmavishvaas main ijapha hoga
 But Ashish Khanna, executive director and CEO of Tata Power Solar, seems a bit skeptical in this matter
 ve kehete hai, ''kuch zyada hi aakraamak boli or pravesh ke deele-dhaale niyamon ke chalate kam tajurbe vaali companiyaan bhi saura urja ke kshetra main pravesh kar rahi hai
 Because of this, they are not only suffering losses in projects and investments, but the environment among the investing people is also getting worse
 iskaa asar samooche saura urja udyog par pad rahaa he
 Competition is important in its place, but new companies' track record and ability to work must be tested first
 ''niveshkon main solar kii takat ke prati bharosa paidaa karnaa bhi apane aap main ek badi chunauti kaa kaam rahaa he kyonki ghatate shulk ke chalate pehle to saura urja kaa kaarobaar kamjor dikhaai detaa tha

 bharat main solar industry shuruaati daur membharat main saura udyog ab bhi apni shuruaati avasthaa main he or puri tarah ubharkar saamne nahin aa paaya he
 So there are many challenges in the direction of making it a viable alternative to energy and profitable business
 centre for envyranment, energy and water ke nideshak arunabh ghosh kehete hai, ''hamen is kshetra main nijee equity bazaar kii or zyada sahabhaagita kii aavashyaktaa he, jo sansthagat niveshkon ke liye rasta taiyaar karegaa ki ve in pariyojnaon main apana paisa lagaaein
 The government will also have to expand the scope of solar and focus on roof top solar and residential projects so that it can be successful on a large scale
 ''nivesh kii samasyaon ke alaava grid se kharaab judaav, bijli kaa mahangaa bhandaaran or in pariyojnaon main kaam karne ke liye kushal logon kii kami bhi ek badi samasya he

 kai rajya solar project ke prachaar-prasar ke liye apane yahaan vibhinn nitiyaan or niyam to bana chuke hai, lekin aisa koi tarika to he nahin jisase solar panel lagane kaa kharch kam ho jaae
 The cost of installing solar panels on roofs, especially in residential homes, is quite high and that is the major obstacle in the way of solar power projects
 ''jahaan tak bijli ke bhandaaran kaa sawaal he, to usase judi chunautiyaan bhi kuch kam nahin hai
 On the question of storage of electricity, experts like Arunabh Ghosh say that India is still two to three years away from technological development
 lekin is samasya ko bhi hal kar liya jayega
 Currently, solar energy storage is quite expensive and grid connectivity is also scattered, due to which solar energy has proved to be effective as an option in some parts of the country
 vikram solar ke emdi gyanesh choudhary ke shabdon main, ''adhyayan bataate hai ki bharat ke bane solar cell aaayaatit solar cell ke mukaable kam sakasham hai
 We need to avoid any situation that affects our domestic modules or has any impact on its sustainability as 60 percent of the total cost of the project goes into the module itself
 ''solar sanyantron main istemaal kiye jane vaale pivi (photovolteik cell, jo sidhe bijli paidaa karte hai) modul kii gunvattta hi lambii daud main bharat kii saura mahatvakankshaon kaa rasta tay karegaa
 Investors, financiers and lenders benefit the most from PV systems, but if these modules fail, then they also have to bear the most risk
 isliye yah kehane kii jarurat nahin ki in modul ko antarrashtriya str kaa or shreshth hona chahie

 agar aisa karne vaala koi bahut hi sadha hua diarector ho or vah bhi gauri scindia jaisaa jisane 'english winglish' jaisi film banaai ho to usase ummiden doguni ho jaati hai
 But coming to 'dear Zindagi', Gauri disappoints very badly

 aaie jaanate hai isfilmaki is silver jubilee par film se judi kuch khaas baaten:1

 2
 Impressed by the audience's appreciation of Royraul Royke, Mahesh Bhatt signed him for the next two films 'junoon' and 'janam'
 3
 According to Mahesh Bhatt, the film 'aashiqui' was influenced by Kiran Bhatt, her first wife in real life and her own story when Mahesh Bhatt taught Kiran to be a typist
 4
 The song 'mera Dil Tere Liye' from the film was inspired by John Farnham's song 'you're the Voice' in those days
 5
 Rahul Roy's voice in the film was dubbed by 'aditya Pancholi'
 6
 Mahesh Bhatt had gone to congratulate Rahul Roy's mother in 'savvy Magazine' at that time when he got his eye on Rahul and Mahesh Bhatt had made up his mind to take Rahul in his film
 7
 All the songs of the film were recorded for an album but after listening to them Mahesh Bhattane urged Gulshan Kumar that he wanted to take these songs in the film and eventually called it a musical hit
 8
 Pooja Bhatt was to appear in the lead role in the film but Anu Aggarwal's entry in the film was due to some reasons

 Input: imdb, Wikipedia, Gomolo chaar rajyon main badi chunavi haar ke baad jahaan atakalein lagaai ja rahi thim ki, isse congress ke bheetar team rahul kamjor hoga, vahiin iske ulat congress ke ucch padast sutron kaa daawa he ki, ab isse bura kuch ho nahin saktaa, aise main yahi vakt he ki, congress main bade pherbadal kaa or rahul kii tajposhi kaa
 a senior leader close to the Gandhi family, who did not wish to be named, said that the electoral defeat of the four states had nothing to do with the change in the Congress organization or with Rahul's coronation
 balki, ye utani jaldi hoga, jitna aap soch bhi nahin sakate
 After some time, the official statement of Congress also came on the same lines
 party ke media prabharee randeep surajevaala ne kaha ki,haar ko sanghathan main badlaav se nahin joda jaae, samay aane par akalan karke party faisla karegi
 Preparation for major changes in june-july
 
 
 june ke aakhir tak yaa july kii shuruyaat main party main badlaav ke sanket mil rahe hai
 Many general secretaries will be on leave and many new faces will be in place
 sutron ke mutabik, nai team main yuvaaon ko jagah jarur milegi, lekin team sangyojan main nae or puraane donon chehre honge
 Whose leaves can be cut
 
 
 sutron kaa daawa he ki, takreeban 8 rashtriya mahasachiv str ke netaaon kii pad se chuttee ho sakati he, jinamein ambika soni, mohan prakaash, madhusudan mistre, seepi joshi, bike hariprasad, mukul vaasanic or gurudas kaamat shaamil hai
 Also, the final decision is yet to be decided on the organization general secretary Janardan Dwivedi and Punjab in-charge Shakeel Ahmed
 vahiin digvijay singh ko mahasachiv pad par banaae rakhane ke asaar hai
 Talking about the post of treasurer, the old leader Motilal Vora is also being considered for rest
 unki jagah rajasthan ke purv siem ashok gahalot yaa phir susheel kumaar scindia ko laane par vichaar chal rahaa he
 The exchange of lists between Sonia and Rahul has also started
 jinako mil sakati he sanghathan main jagah
 
 
 The combination of new and old faces in the new team is being taken special care of
 team rahul ke kai netaaon ko sachiv pad die jaaenge
 At the same time, old leaders like Kamal Nath, Bhupinder Singh Hooda, Anand Sharma can find place at the General Secretary level
 saath hi agar shila dikshit ko upi nahin bheja jaataa he to wo bhi party mahasachiv pad kii prabal daavedaar hongi
 If we talk about new faces for the post of General Secretary, then the Dalit leader closest to Rahul
 raju ke saath hi bhavar jitendra singh, arpyen singh, suraj hegade, minakshi natarajan or milind devda sareekhe netaa res main hai
 Two options for Rahul's coronation
 
 It is certain that this year Rahul Gandhi will become the President of the Congress, but when the coronation takes place, the Gandhi family is considering two options
 pehla vikalp ye ki june main party main badlaav ke saath hi maheene ke aakhir main yaa july kii shuruyaat main rahul ko adhyaksh manonith kar diya jaae or phir baad main oktober main sanghathan ke sambhavit chunaav main wo adhyaksh chun liye jaaen
 The other option is to make changes in the party right now, watch Rahul work informally, and sit with the new team in a few months, after which Sonia Gandhi resigns from the post of president in October and then Rahul president in the organization elections
 Take the chair by contesting kul milakar lagaataar haar ke baad ab jald congress apane sanghathan main badlaav karne ko taiyaar dikh rahi he lekin is lakeer ke saath ki haar ho yaa jeet unke agle adhyaksh rahul gandhi hi honge or isi saal honge
 After all, what the Gandhi family has already decided that Rahul is the future of the Congress and if Priyanka will come into active politics in future, then in the role of Rahul's ally
 agar aap bhartiya sena main job karnaa chaahate he to aapke liye ek acha mauka he

 lekin kya aap jaanate hai jin viraat kohli kii vajah se anil kumble ko istipha dena padaa do saal pehle kumble ne unke hi bare main kya kaha tha
 Let us tell you what Kumble said about Virat

 Both Dhoni and Kohli are the best captains of Team India
 On asking a question that the current Indian team has two captains, Virat Kohli (test captain) and MS Dhoni (ODI captain) are both successful captains
 iskaa jawaab dete hue kumble ne kaha ki bhartiya team ke paas do achche captain hai
 Dhoni is a good captain in the current team
 unhone do world cap jite hai, champions trophy jiti he or team india ko test main nabanr van bhi banaaya he
 After Dhoni, Virat Kohli took over the command of Team India
 viraat kohli ne srilanka daure par test siries jiti he or srilanka main acha pradarshan bhi kiya he
 We already have two successful captains, so there is no need for a third captain
 abhi maujuuda samay main dhoni or kohli kaaphi acchhee captaini kar rahe hai
 Lucky was the captain who was a player like Sehwag in my team, when Kumble was told that Virender Sehwag has said that you were the best captain when he played under your captaincy
 is par kumble ne kaha ki main kaaphi bhaagyashaalee captain tha jo sahvaag jaisaa khilaadi meri team main tha
 When we selected the team for the Australian tour in 2008
 us samay sehvaag form main nahin the or bhartiya team kaa hissaa bhi nahin the
 But when he was selected in the team, after that Sehwag did not look back and started scoring centuries, double centuries and even third centuries

 E-governance is not new in India
 yaa yon kahen ki pichley do dashak se is shabd kaa zikr itani zyada baar hua ki logon ko yah basi lagane laga
 One reason for this sadness was that people used to hear the word, but its real effect did not reach them
 shaayad isiilie pichhali manmohan singh sarkaar ne railway, passport, aadhaar card or inakam tex jaisi sevaaon main jabardast i-gavarnence uplabdh karaane ke baavjood is sangya ko naaraa banane kii himmat nahin dikhaai
 E-governance became a government slogan as soon as the Narendra Modi government came to the center, although this time it was called "digital India" instead of e-governance
 is saal may main pradhanmantri ne digital india saptaah kaa shubharambh kar apane digital iraadon ko jaahir kiya
 Websites like mygov, PMO India and Digital India became the most prominent websites of the government's e-governance project
 baaki mantralayon kii websites ko bhi jarurat ke hisaab se badla gaya taaki ve zyada se zyada jaankariyaan saralata se logon tak pahunchaa saken
 All departments of the government used e-book for the first time to make their achievements public
 lekin 2015 main i-gavarnence kaa asli badlaav aayaa nae ap dizin hone se
 It has been a year when apps like taxi, ticket booking, food ordering, bank transactions, news, weather and almost everything else, along with websites have come on the market
 ap aane kaa matlab tha ki ab in saare kaamon ko karne ke liye laptop yaa computer screen kii jagah mobile phone kii screen kaa istemaal hoga
 In order to reach the hands of 70 crore mobile holders of the country, the government also chose the way of the app
 aaj sthiti yah he ki sarkari kshetra ke takreeban sabhi bainkon ke tranjaction mobile yaa internet ke jariye kiya ja sakate hai
 Railway tickets can be booked from mobile
 pehle se chali aa rahi in suvidhaon ke saath hi jivan pramaan or digital loker jaise darjanon ap sarkaar ne jari kiye hai
 Jeevan Pramaan App is designed for people getting pension
 darasal ab tak yahi chalan tha ki pension paane vaale vyakti ko ek nishchit samyavadhi main bank jaakar yah bataanaa hota tha ki vah jivit he or koi doosraa vyakti uski pension nahin hadap rahaa he
 The person getting pension through the new app can do the same work online
 ab tak 11
 39 lakh people have availed this scheme
 isi tarah digital loker main log apane mahatvapurn dastavej scan kar rakh sakate hai or sarkari khato-kitabat main unke liye dastavejon kii photo copy le janaa ab anivaary nahin rah gaya he
 In hospitals like AIIMS, pre-appointment for OPD can be taken through the e-hospital app
 jo log ekwas main opidi kaa parchaa banavaane ke liye kabhi qatari main lag chuke hon, ve is ksht ko zyada acchhee tarah samaj sakate hai
 Yes, it is true that the line of formulation at AIIMS is not over yet and not all the major hospitals of the country have come under this ambit, but for 2015 it was a happy start
 rashtriya i-gavarnence yojana ke aankadon ke mutabik is samay sarkaar ke 31 mishan mod project main sidhe janata ko phayda pahunchane vaale i gavarnence sevaayen chaalu hai
 The sharp rise in e-transactions in the banking system in the country can be understood
 2013 main desh main jahaan 84 karod i tranjection hue, vahiin 2015 main yah sankhya 258 karod tak pahunch gai
 Apart from these direct government measures, the presence of government and ministers on social media brought a new kind of pleasant feeling
 masalan ab kisi netaa ke sandesh ko jaanane ke liye uski press conference yaa vijyapti kaa intjaar nahin karnaa padataa, vah ek twit ke jariye apni baat rakh detaa he
 On the other hand, the common man is also able to reach the government through a tweet
 uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ne to is saal twit kaa aisa istemaal kiya ki kaala dhan pakadvane se viklang kisaan ko muaavja dene tak unhone twitor or fasebuk kaa istemaal kiya
 Railway Minister Suresh Prabhakar Prabhu has even sent milk for the troubled child in the train
 haalanki yah baat bhi sahi he ki har maamle main soshal media se madad nahin mil paati, lekin aisa maahaul to banataa hi he, jahaan logon kaa bharosa jamata he or sarkaar ko zyada paardarshee hona padataa he
