 Pakistan's troubled government today sought the military's help to end the political crisis created by ongoing protests led by opposition leader Imran Khan and influential Maulana Tahiral Qadri
 pradhanmantri navaj sharif ke kursi chhodane kii maang se kadri or khan ne hatane se inkaar kar diya he, jiske baad sena pramukh general raahil sharif kii madad maangane kaa faisla kiya gaya
 Earlier in the day, Rahil Sharif met the Prime Minister today to discuss the ongoing political crisis for two weeks
 teen din main yah unki duusari mulaakaat thi
 Both protesting leaders announced that Prime Minister Sharif has asked General Sharif to mediate
 imran khan ne apane samarthakon ko sambodhit karte hue kaha, general raahil sharif ne hamase baatcheet ke liye kuch or samay dene ko kaha he, kadri ne bhi apane bhaashan main is baat kii pushti kii ki sena pramukh ne sankat ko samaapt karne ke liye 24 ghante dene ko kaha he
 In an effort to end Pakistan's political crisis, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif today agreed to face charges of murdering 14 supporters of religious leader Qadri, but Qadri rejected it, saying the prime minister should also be charged with terror charges
 lahore main police ne model toun kshetra main kadri ke samarthakon kii hatya main kathith bhoomika ko lekar aakhirkaar pradhanmantri sharif, unke bhai or punjab praant ke mukhyamantri shahbaaj, pramukh cabinet sadasyon or varisht adhikariyon ke khilaaf hatya kaa maamla darj kiya jo dharmaguru kii pramukh maang thi
 Police in Lahore finally registered a murder case against Prime Minister Sharif, his brother and Chief Minister of Punjab province, Shahbaz, key cabinet members and senior officials for their alleged role in killing Qadri's supporters in the Model Town area, which was the prime minister's main demand
 
 punjab police pravaktaa nabila gajanfar ne kaha, lahore hoicourt ke aadesh par praathmiki darj kii gai
 He said that an FIR was lodged on the complaint of Qadri's organization Pakistan Awami Tehreek
 haalanki kadri isse santusht nahin hai or unhone kaha, jab tak aatankwaad kanoon nahin lagaaya jaataa, main is praathmiki ko sweekaar nahin karata
 Pakistan tehreek-e-insaf president Khan and Pakistan Awami Tehreek (PAT) chief Qadri closed the dialogue with official interlocutors after the fifth round of talks remained inconclusive
 kadri ne imran khan ko apana bhai bataaya
 Qadri said, today is the day of freedom from economic and social exploitation
 is desh ke 10 karod garib is bhrasht evam anuchit vyavastha ke gulam hai
 Continuing the demand for Sharif's resignation, Khan said, "I will not leave here
" main is rajshahi ko sweekaar nahin karuunga
 i want real democracy
 khan ne kaha, yah faisla kiya gaya he ki shahbaaj sharif ke khilaaf praathmiki darj hogi, lekin unhone faisla kiya ki vah istipha nahin denge
 Media reports said that amid mounting pressure from demonstrations, Sharif chaired a high-level meeting in the capital to discuss the current political crisis
 ‘don news’ ne khabar di ki baithak main faisla kiya gaya ki na to pradhanmantri or na hi punjab praant ke mukhyamantri shahbaaj istipha denge or sangheey tathaa prantiy vidhansabhaayen bhi bhang nahin hongi
 During the chairmanship of the meeting today, Sharif also said that he would cooperate fully in the investigation in the Model Town area case
 media report main kaha gaya he ki lahore ke model toun ilaake main 17 june kii jhadpon se prabhavit parijanon kii maang ke anuroop praathmiki darj kii gai
 The Lahore sessions court this month ordered the police to register a case of murder against 21 people named in the Qadri-led PAT complaint
 pakistan police ne haalanki sharif or unke bhai evam punjab ke mukhyamantri shahbaaj sharif or kuch sheersh cabinet mantriyon ke khilaaf hatya kaa maamla darj karne se inkaar kar diya tha
 The Sessions court also referred to Sharif, his brother Shahbaz, his nephew Hamza Shahbaz, Home Minister Chaudhary Nisar, Defense Minister Khwaja Asif, Railway Minister Rafiq, Information Minister Parvez Rashid, Minister of State Abid Sher Ali (also a relative of Sharif), former Punjab Law Minister Rana Sanaullah
 And ordered a case of murder against top police officers who took part in the 'barricade removal campaign'
 kadri ne yah bhi maang kii thi ki maamla darj hone ke baad donon sharif bhai- navaj or shahbaaj istipha den
 The political deadlock has been going on for the past two weeks and the Khan-led PTI and the Qadri-led PAT have not agreed to back down from demanding the Prime Minister's resignation over the alleged rigging of the general elections last year and the murder of 14 PAT supporters in Lahore
 rashtriya rajdhani main pradarshnkaree sharif ke istife kii maang ko lekar 19 agast se sansad bhawan or ucchtam nyaayalay bhawan ke samaksh dharne par baithe hai

 It is not that the medical administration is not informed about the presence of quacks in medical wards
 lekin bataaya jaataa he ki doctoron or neem hakimon ke bich aankh-michauli kaa rishta he
 When doctors come to checkup the patients, neem hakims make distances from the hospital
 or jab neem hakim apane tareeke se marijon kaa ilaaj karte hai, tab para medical staff to kya doctor bhi aspataal se apana naata tod lete hai

 The demand for action by the Government of Pakistan against jaish-e-mohammed chief Maulana Masood Azhar seems to have had an impact
 sutron se mili jaankaree ke anusaar pakistan sarkaar masood ajahar ke khilaaf karrwai karne kaa man bana rahi he
 Sources say that although the Pakistan government does not want to appear under pressure from India while doing so
 yahi vajah he ki pakistan abhi masood ajahar ko jail main daalane jaisi karrwai ke paksh main nahin dikh rahaa he
 It is reported that the Government of Pakistan is also considering that it should not oppose the unsc's inclusion of Masood Azhar in the list of global terrorists
 agar pakistan sarkaar aisa karti he to phir china kii taraf se bhi masood ke virodh main vito power ke istemaal karne kaa aadhaar khatm ho jayega
 Explain that the US, UK and France have proposed a new proposal regarding Masood Azhar
 is prastaav ko lekar china ke paas 13 march tak vito kaa istemaal karne kaa mauka he
 According to sources, the Imran Khan government has been engaged in the brainstorm over the past few days about what Pakistan is getting by supporting such 'personalities'
 imran khan ke is soch ke peeche vahaan kii army bhi khadi dikhti he yaa kuch yun kahen ki imran khan ko vahaan kii army kaa puraa saath mil rahaa he ki to isamen koi atishyokti nahin hogi
 Imran Khan did not face any protest in Pakistan after the release of Abhinandan, the wing commander of India due to the support of the army
 aisa mana ja rahaa he ki agar yahi faisla navaj sharif sarkaar leti to pakistan main 'modi kaa yaar pakistan kaa gaddaar jaise naare lagaae jate
 The decision of the Imran Khan government to release the Wing Commander was not opposed by any political party in Pakistan, even there was no major protest
 sarkaar se jude sutron ke anusaar pakistan kii sarkaar rashtriya hit main kuch kade faisle lene kii taiyaari main he
 One reason for this is that Pakistan is facing tough challenges on the economic front these days
 aatankwaad ko lekar kadaa rukh dikhaae or isapar kaabo paae bina wo financiel ection task force ke grey list se nahin nikal saktaa he
 The danger of having a black list is different, which will present a more economic challenge
 isliye imran sarkaar jaison ke khilaaf dhire-dhire kadam uthaane kii taiyaari main hai

 During President's rule, Harish Rawat was successful in conveying the message that wrong has happened to him and the public had also misconceived about us, but now the situation is changing

 The same maneuver to change the image, JP has put a lot of effort in improving the image

 This strategy was adopted by the BJP even before the President's rule, but then the BJP fell back and the party leaders started saying that now it will be difficult to remove Rawat even in the elections

" Were found ''khayr, bijepi ne khaas taur se un 44 vidhansabha kshetron main pardaafash yatra nikaali jahaan uske vidhayak nahin hai

 Union Home Minister p Chidambaram today said that there has been no reduction in the threat from Pakistan and there has been an increase in infiltration cases along the border since May this year

 This is our opinion

 In response to a question about 50 to 60 infiltration cases in a month, Chidambaram said that infiltration cases from Pakistan have increased
 unhone kaha ki hamane maanviya khufia soochnaaon or takneekee soochnaaon ke aadhaar par yah akalan kiya he
 About 50 to 60 cases of infiltration are taking place in a month

 However, there is no clarification from UIDAI in this regard at present

 iske lis oparator ko apni website or ap par iske liye jaruri intjaam karne honge

 Agents of companies will come home: The third way is that your telecom operator can send agents to your house

 lebanon prashasan syria ke sharnaarthiyon ko apane desh main permanent jagah dene ke khilaaf hai
 This is the reason why there are no official refugee camps and the Syrian people can work only in sectors like farming, cleaning and construction
 jain ke pita ne bataaya 'hamaare aarthik halaat behad kharaab the
 i was working hard day and night
 iske baavjood badi mushkil se mere parivaar kaa guzar-basar ho paa rahaa tha

 The film was released and received a tremendous response from the audience
 jain bhi is film ke relies hone ke saath behad charchaa main aa gaya

 lekin ab main ummid kar saktaa hum ki mere bachche bhi padhalikh kar ejeeniyar doctor ban sakate hai
 But at first i could not even think of such dreams

 Failing to stop crime, Indore police-administration has blamed its failures on medicines
 police ne anokhaa aadesh jari kar shahar kii dawa kii dukaanon par anidra or avsaad se judi paanch tarah kii dawaaon ko khule taur par bechney par na sirf pratibandh lagaaya, balki chikitsak kii mul parchi jamaa karne or bill record rakhane ke aadesh bhi dawa vikritaon ko die hai
 Rasuka will take action against the seller who disobeys the order
 1 agast se lagu kar die gaye is avyaavhaarik aadesh se dawa vikritaon or chikitsakon main jahaan hairaani he vahiin marijon kii mushkilen bad gai hai
 The question is also whether the ban is imposed only to the urban limits, while these drugs are readily available in the surrounding area
 ye ve dawaaen hai jinka istemaal madhumeh, hridayrog, manorog or dard nivarak ke rup main hota he
 But the police claim that the drug named Nitravet is increasing the trend of crime among the youth of the city
 isi dawa kii uttejnaa main aise yuvaaon ne hatyaein tak kar daaleen, jinka kabhi koi aapraadhik record nahin rahaa
 Endocrinologist Drs

 "these medicines are given to patients in limited quantities," says Jain
 atyadhik maatra main inke seven se aakraamakata bad sakati he
 "due to fear of Rasuka, many drug dealers have stopped keeping these medicines
" aadesh ke mutabik dawa vikreta chikitsak kii mul parchi jamaa karne lage hai jo marijon ke liye paravshani kaa sabab he kyonki mul parchi vikreta jamaa kar legaa to har baar dawa kharidne ke liye parchi likhavani hogi or har baar chikitsak ko paraamarsh shulk dena padegaa
 After scrutinizing the records of crimes in the city in the last five years and psychoanalyzing the accused, the police proposed a ban on the sale of 12 types of drugs openly
 lekin shahar ke janpratinidhiyon, dawa vikritaon or chikitsakon ke saath charchaa ke baad sirf paanch dawaaon-alprajolam, chlonzipam, dygipam, nitrajipam or lorajipam-kii khule taur par bikri par pratibandh lagaaya gaya
 Top police officials believe that this will help in controlling crimes to an extent, while around 1,500 retail drug dealers and doctors in the city say that the police are not able to get anything due to their failure in finding the drug prescription 
 indore dawa vikreta sangh ke adhyaksh vinay bakaliwaal kehete hai ki ye dawaaen oparation ke dauraan or baad main di jaati hai
 In such times, sometimes the nurse makes a medicine slip, but the seller is no longer accepting this prescription
 aise main marij dawa ke liye paravshan ho rahe hai
 Nursing Home Association chairperson Dr
 sunanda jain bataati hai ki ye dawaaen rajonivritti ke daur se guzar rahi mahilaon ko bhi di jaati hai lekin parchi par ek saath do-teen maah kii dawa nahin likhi jaati
 Now the patient will have to come every time to take a prescription
 haalanki indore chikitsa sangh ke adhyaksh dow
 Anil Bundy says that if it helps in stopping crime, then his full support is with the police-administration
 is muhim kii aguai kar rahe iji sanjay rana kehete hai ki aushadhi evam prashaadhan saamagree adhinium ke tahat praavdhaan he ki chikitsak kii parchi ke bagaiyr kuch khaas kism kii dawaaen nahin kharidi ja sakati hai, ve usee niyam ko sakhti se lagu kar rahe hai
 This ban is imposed with the consent of the drug dealers and doctors
 haalanki nigaraanee se dikkat na ho isliye unheen ke saath milakar ek jaanch dal bhi banaaya ja rahaa he
 Surprised by the unique order of the police-administration, the medical system "law" Certain types of medicines cannot be purchased without a doctor's prescription

 The JMM is generally happy to agree on the deal, as it believes it wanted half the rights in the state government, which has been met

 What is the level of 'IQ' of Father of the Nation Mahatma Gandhi? We are not asking this question, but under the 'right to Information' Act, a curious question has been asked as to what is the 'IQ' level of Mahatma Gandhi
 soochna paane ke apane adhikaar kaa istemaal karte hue ahmedabad main rahane vaale ek shaks ne apni yachika main kendriya soochna ayog se yah ajeebogareeb sawaal poocha lekin ayog ne uski yachika ko khaarij kar diya
 Dismissing the petition, the Commission said that seeking such information is certainly a long stretch of the Right to Information Act
 yachikakarta ne mahatma gandhi, kuch purv raashtrapatiyon or anya mantriyon ke bare main soochna maangi thi
 Apart from the exact date of birth, time, his 'blood group' was also asked
 lekin, yachika main sabase pehla sawaal ‘aikyuu’ ke str se judaa tha
 However, the Central Public Information Officer had informed the petitioner that the information sought was not available with the President's Secretariat
 yah jawaab aane ke baad yachikakarta ne kendriya soochna ayog main apil kii
 The Central Information Commissioner Satyanand Mishra rejected the plea, saying that seeking information related to the 'IQ' level of ministers or former presidents is certainly expanding the scope of the Right to Information Act
 samaajawaadee party shanivaar ko tut ke ek kadam or kareeb pahunch gai
 Seeing the rebellion of Akhilesh Yadav, Mulayam Singh Yadav sent five senior party leaders Revathiraman Singh, Beni Prasad Verma, Mata Prasad Pandey, Naresh Agarwal and Kiranmay Nanda to persuade Akhilesh Yadav, but the meeting remained inconclusive
 dedh ghante chali is baithak ke baad akhilesh yadav ne in netaaon se kaha ki unke pita mulaayam singh yadav aaj kal bete se zyada amar singh par bharosa kar rahe hai
 Akhilesh Yadav said that he is not ready to bow down until the issues raised by him are resolved
 akhilesh yadav ne yah bharosa bhi nahin diya ki party or pita kii izzat bachaane ke liye 5 taarikh ko ho rahe samaajawaadee party ke rajat jayanti samaaroh main wo hissaa lenge
 There are also reports that Ram Gopal Yadav will also not be present at Samajwadi Party's 25th anniversary celebrations at Janeshwar Mishra Park in Lucknow on 5 November
 akhilesh yadav yah bilkul nahin chaahate ki vah party ke lakhon kaaryakartaaon or netaaon ke saamne amar singh ke saath manch saajha karen
 Earlier, these senior leaders had met Mulayam Singh Yadav for 2 hours and offered him that he would meet Akhilesh and try to convince him
 sulah kii rahi-sahi ummid bhi us samay jaati rahi, jab party ke pradesh adhyaksh shivpal yadav ne shanivaar kii shaam ko party ke youth wing main nae netaaon ke naamon kii ghoshnaa kar di
 The president of these youth wing organizations was earlier a leader close to Akhilesh Yadav, who was removed by Shivpal Yadav on charges of anti-party activities
 nae naamon kii ghoshnaa kaa saaf matlab he ki akhilesh yadav ke chaheton ke liye shivpal yadav ne darwaja band kar diya he
 The discord of Samajwadi Party became clear when Mulayam Singh Yadav, Shivpal Yadav and Akhilesh Yadav were forced to hold their separate meetings at the same time on Saturday
 mulaayam singh yadav apane ghar par varisht netaaon ke saath baithkar maathapai kar rahe the ki akhilesh yadav ko kaise manaaya jaae
 Mulayam Singh is worried that if Akhilesh leaves his chariot on the 3rd and does not stay in Lucknow on the party's 5th, then he and the party will suffer a lot
 shivpal yadav pradesh adhyaksh kii haisiyat se usee vakt samaajawaadee party ke daftar main baith kar apane nae kaaryakaarani kii baithak le rahe the
 The meeting warned that those who are whispering here and there will be identified and action will be taken against them
 baithak khatm hote hi faisla aa gaya ki mulaayam singh yadav ko chitthee likhane vaaleoncchh udaiveer singh ko 6 saal ke lieparty se nikaal diya gaya he
 Meanwhile, Akhilesh Yadav was holding a meeting with his supporters and leaders expelled from the party, who have stopped going to the Samajwadi Party office
 akhilesh kii baithak kaa ek hi agenda tha, 3 taarikh ko unke chunaav prachaar kaa rath, jab nikle tab sab ko yah ehsaas ho jaae kii party ke log or janata kiske saath he
 On Sunday, Akhilesh Yadav has invited party mlas to his house and all eyes are on this meeting whether Akhilesh Yadav will make any big announcement on Sunday itself
 samaajawaadee party ke jo netaa shanivaar kii shaam ko akhilesh se khaali haath milakar laute, vah ek baar ravivaar ko phir koshish karenge or mulaayam singh ko jaakar bataaenge kii akhilesh ko manaane ke liye kya-kya karnaa hoga
 But at the moment it seems that things are slipping from Mulayam Singh Yadav's hand

 a campaign was launched on a war footing to rescue children trapped in a flood-ravaged cave in northern Thailand

 According to the operation local time, 10 in the morning

 The identity of the rescued children has not been revealed

 According to a BBC report, the Thai Navy SEAL has confirmed to save the children

 Children rescued via helicopters were brought to the hospital
 jin gotakhoron ne bacchon ke pehle samooh ko bachaane kaa kaam kiya tha, vahi duusare abhiyaan main bhi shaamil the
 Officials said that the situation has been better as of Sunday and the rain has not affected the water level of the cave

 pehle bachche ko gupha se ravivaar shaam 5
 40 was evacuated and another 10 minutes later, while two others were evacuated after more than two hours

 If you look at the political life of three decades of Sushil Modi, then this property does not look special
 21 disambar 2011: tasveeron main dekhen india todayah baat bhi he ki ve mukhyamantri nitish kumaar se to behatar hi hai
 From the perspective of personal property, if Nitish is also called the poorest Chief Minister of India, then there will be no wrong

 gramin kaary mantri bhim singh bhi makaanon ke malikana haq ke maamle main apni patni se pichhadate najar aate hai
 Seeing all these figures, it becomes inevitable to get into this thinking
 raajnneeti ke diggaj apane ashriton se garib kaise?jab nitish ne november, 2010 main satta main dobaaraa vaapasi kii thi to mantriyon kii parisampattiyon kii ghoshnaa karnaa unka sabase pehla faisla tha
 Taking a similar decision, NDA-2 also asked the employees and officials to declare the property
 ab vidhayak bhi is baat par raji ho gaye hai ki ve har saal apni parisampattiyon kii ghoshnaa karenge
 Four and a half crores Rs
 kii sampatti ke saath shiksha mantri pi
 K
 shahi nitish kumaar cabinet ke sabase dhani sadsy hai
 However, despite the announcement made keeping in mind the high principles of transparency, many questions still arise
 udhaaharan ke liye, public health ejineering vibhaag (piechaidi) ke mantri chandra mohan raay ne sampatti kii ghoshnaa karte hue saavdhaanee nahin barti he
 Announcing his movable assets, Rai states that he has 30 grams of gold jewelery worth Rs 90,000
 he jabaki unki patni ke paas 800 gram sone or heere ke gahane hai
 The cost of which is around Rs
 3,00,000
 he
 While Rai has priced his jewelery at the current market price, his own wife's jewelery — which is 26 times more than the minister's jewelery — is the same as previously announced
 kuch anya ghoshnaaen or bhi hai, jinhen dekhakar man main sawaal paidaa hote hai
 Just look at these, the 1,600 square feet house located on Kavi Raman Path of Patna Nageshwar Colony near Malti Singh (wife of Rural Affairs Minister Bhim Singh) is priced at Rs 11,10,864
 aanki gai he
 It seems that this price is very low
 yah patna kii vah colony he jahaan makaan kii anumaanit keemat 4,000 ru
 Should not be less than per square foot
 sambhawatah mantri ne maujuuda bazaar keemat ko dhyaan main nahin rakhaa he
 Due to which the purpose of declaration of property has become useless
 iske alaava in ghoshnaaon main ek anya badi kami ghoshnaa karne kii style main ekarupata kaa abhaav he
 Ministers have chosen their own format to declare assets
 mantri bhavishya main apni parisampattiyon kii ghoshnaa main koi sudhaar karte hai, isse hi pataa chal sakegaa ki vaaki yah kavayad kuch rang laa rahi he
 Or is it just a way of presenting things according to our own

 PHED Minister Chandra Mohan Roy has given the price of his and wife's jewelery based on different market prices
 unke 30 gram ke aabhushan 90,000 ru
 K, which is market value in a way
 lekin unki patni ke 800 gram ke sone or heere ke gahanon kii keemat 3,00,000 ru

 There is no information about the price of the property and how the rest of the money will be given by EMI or other means

 Ajay Bharti was trying to fraudulently grab an amount of fifteen lakh rupees
 is par usne aitraaj jataayaa to vidhayak ne bandhak banaakar usase badasluki kii or dhamkee dekar kaaphi beizzat bhi kii
 On the other hand, the accused SP MLA has accused the officer of hanging up the work for several months in his cleaning, while the reality is that it has not been fifteen days since the victim officer was appointed to this post
 elahabaad kii baaraa vidhansabha seat se samaajawaadee party ke tikat par vidhayak chune gaye da
 Vijay Kumar Srivastava, ADM project of Allahabad kept pleading and pleading with folded hands in front of Ajay Kumar Bharti

 According to Vijay Srivastava, the amount of five lakh rupees in these, teacher MLA Suresh Tripathi, MLA Dr
 ajay bharti ke degree college ko di thi jabaki das lakh rupee jonpur ke purv saansad dhananjay singh ne vidhayak ke behad kareebi sapa netaa or block pramukh mohammad mushtak ke college ko die the
 According to project director Vijay Srivastava, since both of these colleges are on lease or government leased land, that's why they objected and kept the file with them
 ediem ke mutabik unhone yah rakam isliye manjuur nahin kii kyonki saansad va vidhayak nidhi kii rakam unhi college ko di ja sakati he, jinke paas khud apni jameen ho
 The ADM claims that both the MLA and his associates have colleges on government lease
 ediem vijay shrivastav ke mutabik sapa vidhayak da
 Ajay Kumar Bharti came to his office on Thursday along with SP MLA Ansar Ahmed and all others from Phaphamau seat and called him ill
 aarope he ki vidhayak bharti ne pandrah lakh rupayon vaali file mangakar ediem se us par dastakhat karne ko kaha
 When he cited the rules, the MLA was furious and announced that he would not allow the officer to move from his chair until the file was signed
 aarope he ki vidhayak ne kai ghanton tak afasar ko bandhak banaakar rakhaa or unke saath badasluki kii
 The ADM was intimidated and forcibly signed several files and took the MLA with them
 afasar ne dabaav main filon par dastakhat to kar die lekin saath hi yah note bhi laga diya ki vah ye aadesh vidhayak ke dabaav main kar rahaa he
 According to the officer, during these three hours, the MLA treated him very badly

 However, the MLA started walking as soon as the media arrived
 is maamle main aaropee vidhayak pehle to media se baat karne ko hi nahin taiyaar hue
 Late in the night, he said in his clarification that the officer had not been doing his work for the past several months and that his files were intentionally hung

 agar aap rashtriya dhvaj tirange se poshaak yani kapadaa silakar pahante hai, to aapako jail kii hawa khaani pad sakati he
 May also have to pay a fine
 teen rangon se bana bharat kaa rashtriya dhvaj aazaadee kaa pratik bhi he
 It is the duty of every Indian to respect it
 agar koi iskaa apmaan karata he, to usko sajaa dene kaa praavdhaan kiya gaya he
 In this regard, the Indian Parliament has enacted a law, in which it is mentioned that when the tricolor is insulted and what is the punishment for it? Under the National Gaurav Insult Prevention Act, wearing of tricolor is made a crime
 iskaa matlab yah hua ki agar koi tirange se kapade silakar pahentaa he, to isko rashtriya dhvaj kaa apmaan mana jaataa he
 a provision of three years in jail and fine has been made for this
 rashtriya gaurav apmaan nivaaran adhinium kii dhara 2 ke mutabik tirange kaa istemaal kisi prakaar kii poshaak yaa vardi ke liye nahin kiya jayega
 In addition, the tricolor will not be brewed or printed on cushions, handkerchiefs, boxes or napkins
 tirange ke saath ek hi pole yaa danda par kisi duusare jhande ko katai nahin lagaaya jayega
 This is also an insult to the national flag
 iske alaava agar nimna main se koi bhi kaary kiya jaataa he, to wo bhi rashtriya dhvaj kaa apmaan mana jayega
 1
 kisi vyakti yaa vastu ko salaami dene ke liye rashtriya dhvaj ko jhukaana
 2
 tirange ko aadha jhukaakar fahraana
 3
 rajkeey yaa sashastr sainya yaa ardhsainik balon ke antim sanskaar ko chhodkar tirange kaa kisi anya rup main lapetna
 4
 kisi pratimaa, smarak, vaktaa kii mej yaa manch dhakne ke liye tirange kaa istemaal karnaa
 5
 jaanboojhkar tirange ko jameen yaa farsh se chuaana yaa pani par ghistane dena
 6
 kisi vaahan, railgadee, naav yaa kisi vayuyan ke top, bagal yaa peeche ke hisse main tirange ko lapetna
 7
 kisi bhawan main pardaa lagane ke liye jhande kaa istemaal karnaa
 8
 jaanboojhkar kesari pattee ko neeche rakhkar bhartiya rashtriya tirange ko fahraana
 9

 Hoisting of the tricolor is a fundamental right of the citizens
 The Indian has the right to fly the tricolor
 saal 2004 main bharat sarkaar banaam naveen jindal maamle main supreme court kaha tha ki har hindustani ko tirangaa fahraane kaa moulik adhikaar he
 It comes under the fundamental right to freedom granted under Article 19 of the Constitution
 supreme court ke is aadesh ke baad se tirange ko fahraane kaa sabhi naagarik ko adhikaar mil gaya he
 Earlier the tricolor was hoisted only in government institutions or educational institutions
 aapako bataa den ki jhande ko sammanpurn or vishisht sthiti main hi fahraaya janaa chahie
 Also, the ratio of the size of the tricolor should always be 3: 2

 kabhi-kabhi to desh drohi kaa thappa bhi laga detaa he
 This message of the film touches the heart, so my rating for 'force-2' is 3 stars

 Bhagwat was asked the question how do you see words like cremation, burial ground, saffron terrorism in politics? In response to this question, Bhagwat said that politics should be for the welfare of the people
 unhone kaha ki lokkalyaan kaa madhyam satta hota he
 If people of the political class start walking like this then there will be no such thing as cremation, graveyard, saffron terrorism
 unhone kaha ki ye sari baaten tab hoti hai, jab raajnneeti keval satta ke liye chalati he
 Those who are in politics need to have that kind of training

 At the same time, the Sangh chief also answered the question of not joining politics and giving only the minister of organization to the BJP and supporting parties other than BJP
 is sawaal parmohan bhagwat ne kaha, 'hamase jo sanghathan mantri maangata he, usee ko diya jaataa he
 So far no other party has asked for the organization minister
 agar hamase maange jaaenge to ham is par bhi vichaar karenge, agar ve dal acha kaam kar rahe honge to jarur denge
 Along with this, the Sangh chief said that in 93 years the Sangh has not supported any party, the Sangh supports only policies
 sangh kii niti kaa samarthan karne vaale sangh kii shakti kaa phayda uthaa jate hai
 He said that when Sangh volunteers fought against the Emergency, they also supported people like Babu Jagjivan Ram and Marxist Gopalan

 pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne varsh 1991 ke bhugtan sankat ke dohraye jane or bhartiya arthvyavastha ke vaishvikaran ke raste se hatane kii ashankaon ko khaarij kiya he
 The Prime Minister told PTI, there is no question of repeating the 1991 (balance of Payments Crisis) crisis
 us samay bharat main videshi mudra vinimay nirdhaarit dar par tha
 Now it is handed over to the market
 ham keval rupee main baari utaar-chadhaav ko hi thik kar sakate hai
 Manmohan Singh said that in 1991, only 15 days of foreign exchange was needed in the country
 ab hamaare paas chah se saat maheene ke liye videshi mudra bhandar he
 Therefore no comparison can be made between the two conditions
 aise main 1991 ke sankat ke dohraye jane kaa sawaal hi paidaa nahin hota
 The comments desh ke chaalu khate ke oonche ghate kii prishtabhumi main pradhanmantri se poocha gaya tha ki kuch virgon ke bich aisi ashanka bad rahi he ki desh 1991 ke sankat kii taraf laut rahaa he
 To get foreign exchange, the country had to mortgage gold and start an economic reform program
 iske baad se desh vishwa arthvyavastha se judane kii raah par aa gaya tha
 The Prime Minister was speaking on the occasion of releasing the fourth part of the history of the Reserve Bank, "reserve Bank History: Looking back and looking forward"

 The Prime Minister then turned to a senior economic journalist and said, ask him, he is the master of these matters
 pradhanmantri ne pitiai se kaha, varsh 1991 ke (bhugtan santulan sankat) sankat ko doharaaye jane kaa sawaal hi paidaa nahin hota he
 At that time the foreign currency exchange in India was at a fixed rate
 ab yah bazaar ke hawaale he
 We can only correct huge fluctuations in the rupee
 manmohan singh ne kaha ki varsh 1991 main desh main keval 15 din kii jarurat kii videshi mudra bachi thi
 Now we have foreign exchange reserves for six to seven months
 isliye donon sthitiyon ke bich koi tulana nahin kii ja sakati
 In such a situation, there is no question of repeat of 1991 crisis
 tippaniyan Against the backdrop of the high current account deficit of the country, the Prime Minister was asked that there is growing apprehension among some sections that the country is returning to the crisis of 1991
 videshi mudra paane ke liye desh ko sona girvee rakhana padaa tha or aarthik sudhaar kaarykram kii shuruyaat kerani padi thi

 Without all these things you cannot spend quality time with your partner, no matter how much you try to get lost in moments of love

 On the other hand, if you meet your partner constantly, sometimes the relationship starts to become a bit cumbersome
 zyada milane ek or nukasaan ye bhi hota he ki aapkaa partner aapako granted lene lage or sex main unki ruchi bhi kam ho jaae
 It also does not mean that you start ignoring your partner
 lekin romance kaa majaa lene ke liye aapako khud ko or apanepartner ko ekadam free rakhanapadegaa
 With this, according to this study, if you spend quality time and meet each day in balance, then the relationship becomes stronger

 The death of Gaurav Tiwari of the Toindian Paranormal Society of Delhi Police is not paranormal but Gaurav committed suicide

 The housemates told the police that at around 11 am on July 7, there was a sudden sound of something falling from the bathroom
 is par gaurav ke pita or patni jab bathroom kii taraf bhaage, to paaya ki bathroom kaa darwaja andar se band he

 gaurav ke gale main chunni kaa fanda ksaa tha or uskaa doosraa sira bathroom kii chat par kundi se bandhaa tha
 There are many reasons to consider suicide, instead of considering the death of Gaurav as paranormal, the police has many reasons to consider suicide
 jaise-1
 The bathroom door was locked from inside, which meant that Gaurav had closed the door himself
 2
 Gaurav's body was hanging from the noose
 3
 There was no one else in the house other than Gaurav's parents and wife
 4
 Apart from Gaurav's throat, no other marks of injury were found and the mark on the throat is due to the noose

 postmortem report gaurav kii maut kii vajah to bataa degi, par sawaal ye he ki gaurav ne khudakushi aakhir kyon kii
 Gaurav said that Gaurav lost his life by getting stuck in the relationship, although the girl with whom Gaurav's relationship is coming out before marriage has described his relationship with Gaurav as a rumor in the conversation till date
 maut ke ek din pehle doston se mila tha gauravadilli police ko chaanbin ke dauraan pataa chalaa ki gaurav kaa shaadi se pehle usee kii indian paranormal sosayadi se judi ek ladki ke saath rishta tha
 But then for some reason their relationship broke up, after which Gaurav got married in February this year
 chah july kii raat ko yani maut se ek din pehle gaurav apane kai doston se mila tha, jinamein se ek wo ladki bhi thi
 On the evening of July 6, Gaurav went from the house to check out a haunted place in Delhi and returned home at half past one in the evening

 Police say that it was through the media that they got information about Gaurav's relationships
 ghar waalon ne kabhi aisa kuch nahin kaha
 According to Delhi Police sources, it is quite possible that Gaurav was upset due to the relationship and that is why he committed suicide because till now no other reason has been revealed in the investigation, due to which Gaurav would have died

 Jyoti Basu, who had the record of being the longest Chief Minister in the country, came very close to becoming the Prime Minister in 1996, but then his party CPI (M) decided against doing what this senior leader said while saying "historical omission"
 That history does not repeat such occasions and their point proved to be true
 desh main1996main hue loksabhaa chunaav ke khandit janadesh main congress satta main nahin laut saki ourbhajapa sarkaar banane kii sthiti main nahin thi
 In those circumstances, it was important for non-congress senior leaders to choose the Prime Ministerial candidate in Tamil Nadu House here
 vishwanath pratap singh kaa naam saamne aayaa lekin unhone use thukrakar sanyukt morcha sarkaar ke pradhanmantri ke rup main jyoti basu kaa naam sujhaayaa
 Taking this proposal seriously, the then CPI (M) General Secretary Harkishan Singh went to Surjitparty
 makapa paulitte beuro main is par charchaa hui or gahare matbhed ubharne parmamala kendriya samiti ke supurd kar diya gaya
 The Central Committee, led by radical left leaders, rejected the offer to make Jyoti Basu the Prime Minister, saying that the party was not yet in a position to be able to implement its policies in the United Front government
 kamred surajeet ne jab sanyukt morcha kennetaon ko party ke is faisle se avgat karaayaa to veepi singh ne ek baar phir makapa ouruski kendriya samiti se uske us‘durbhagyapun’nirnay par punarvichaar karne kaaagrah kiya
 On the request of VP Singh, Surjit from Tamil Nadu House called Prakashkarat and asked him to remain in Kodilli, the leaders of the Central Committee, for an emergency meeting
 lekin kendriya samiti ne peshkash ko thukraa diya
 Basu had called it a "historic blunder" after prolonged silence over the party's decision to step out of the fold to allow the first communist leader in the country to become the country's prime minister
 kuch samay baad basu kii is tippanee ke bare mempuche jane par unhone phir doharaaya, ‘‘haa,main abhi bhi maanata hum ki vah aitihaasikmaha-bhul thi,kyonki aise avasar dobaaraa nahin aate
 History does not repeat such occasions
 ’’unhone kaha tha ki sanyukt morcha ne yah jaanate hue bhi ki vah marxvaadi auracommunist hai,unhan pradhanmantri banane kii peshkash isliye kii thi ki pradhanmantri padke liye unhen us samay koi anya vyakti najar nahin aa rahaa tha
 Basu's death The memorial meeting of the Permacampolit Polit Bureau held here today also recalled the "maha-bhoola" of 1996
 baithak ke baad party ke varisht netaa seetaram yechuri nesamvaadadaataaon se kaha, ‘‘ek samay jab pradhanmantri pad ke liye unka naam chalaa to unki raithi ki pradhanmantri pad sweekaar kiya jaae,lekin party kii raay alag thi
 Jyoti Basune set the example of left and party discipline by following the party's opinion
 ’’makapa dwaara basu ko pradhanmantri banane kii peshkash thukraa die jane par ji kemupanaar or janata dal netaa tathaa karnataka ke tatkaaleen mukhyamantri ech di devegoda kanaam aayaa
 In this race, Deve Gowda won
 us samay janata dal ke hi ramakrishnahegade kaa naam bhi sambhavit pradhanmantri ke naamon main chalaa lekin vah gati nahin bonapaaya

 In this episode, the new name has come from Andhra Pradesh CM Chandrababu Naidu
 naidu kaa kahana he ki unhen is baat ko lekar chintaa ho rahi he ki notebandi ke baad ho rahi dikkaton kaa philhal ant hota nahin dikh rahaa he
 The bjp's ally Telugu Desam Party (TDP) leader was the first non-bjp leader to support the Modi government's decision on demonetisation
 lekin ab unka sabar bhi tuutata dikh rahaa he
 Naidu has said that even after 40 days of demonetisation, despite many efforts of the central government, many problems are still being faced and solutions are not visible
 naidu nearabiai ko salaahdi he ki wo har din 4000 karod rupee chhap saktaa he
 He also said that all kinds of problems are coming up on digital payments and the country does not have the necessary infrastructure to be completely cashless
 yahaan gaur karne vaali baat yah bhi he ki notembdi ke elaan ke agle din hi yani 9 november ko tidipi ne daawa kiya ki bhrashtachar ke khilaaf jang main naidu kii yah jeet he

 But such signals from the allies are not good
 akali dal ko lagata he ki isse punjab mengthbandhan kii satta main vapasiki ummiido par vipareet asar padegaa
 These fears of the Akali Dal will affect the ruling BJP at the center
 kyonki haal main notebandi ke elaan ke baad maharashtra main hue nikaay chunaavon main sattarudh party ko phayda ho rahaa he
 In Maharashtra, BJP has emerged as the winner in both the phases
 notebandi se jude nae-nae farmaanon or isse ho rahi dikkaton se na sirf logon ke bich sarkaar ko lekar naaraazgi he, balki centre main sahyogi kuch anya partiyaan bhi isse khush najar nahin aa rahi hai
 In Maharashtra itself, bjp's ally Shiv Sena has expressed its displeasure many times on the issue of demonetisation
 notebandi ke elaan ke baad hi shivasena ne piem modi par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki pradhanmantri ne un logon ko dhokhaa diya he jinhone unhen satta tak pahunchaaya
 President Pranab Mukherjee said on Saturday that awareness should be raised about adopting arbitration as an alternative way to resolve disputes
 unhone chetaya ki log kanoon kii jatilta or maamalon ke sulajhane main ho rahi deree se niraash ho rahe hai
 Pranab said, 'there is a growing number of people who are frustrated by the complexity of the law, considerable delays and unproductive use of their resources in litigation
 kai saamaajik sangharsh kanoonee vivaad main badal jate hai
 These situations exacerbate the problem rather than solve it
 'raashtrapati ne kaha ki yah samajhnaa mahatvapurn he ki hamaare desh main sudrudh, swatantra or paardarshee nyaay pranali he, iske baavjood durbhagyapurna sachai yah he ki kanoonee vivaad sulajhane main kaaphi samay or kharch donon lagate hai
 In a one-day national seminar on mediation organized by the Supreme Court's Arbitration and Conciliation Project Committee, he said that such efforts should be made that alternative methods of resolving disputes become an integral part of the statutory system
 unhone kaha ki vivaad ko sulajhane main kargar vaikalpik tareeke ko protsaahit karnaa or lokapriy bananaa vakt kii jarurat he
 An alternative mechanism for resolving disputes not only provides quick justice, but is also a process in which the end result remains under the control of the plaintiff and the complainant

 Earlier RSVP used to be in economics
 ab RSVP kaa model aayaa he

 Then Priyanka said that sometimes ABCD, sometimes RSVP

 Until the afternoon of 14 February, the video of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) taking credit for killing 40 jawans went viral on social media, Adil Ahmad Dar's family considered him a C-category militant
 
 ve yahi ummid lagaae baithe the ki unka ladkaa samarpan kar degaa or apane chachere bhai tawsiff ahamed kii tarah jail kaatega
 But, when this news came, the people of Gandhibagh village in South Pulwama district of this family were shocked and shocked
 19 varsh ke us ladke ko jaanane vaala har koi use ''sharmila or shant" swabhaav kaa bataa rahaa tha
 a year earlier, he left the 12th standard and joined the Afzal Guru Squad of jaish-e-mohammed (the squad of local Kashmiris)
 uske dost kehete hai ki vah kabhi-kabhaar hi khulata tha or zyaadaatar cricket kii baaten hi karata tha
 In such a turbulent environment in the valley, it is surprising to hear that Adil was a fan of the Indian cricket team and Mahendra Singh Dhoni was his hero
 lekin 2016 kii garmiyon main hijbul mujahidin ke 'karishmai' commander burhan vaani ke maare jane ke baad adil kuch badal-sa gaya tha (jaisaa ki puri ghati main hua)
 Some of this may be due to the fact that during the nearly month-long demonstrations after Wani's death, he was shot in the leg and was severely insulted by the SOG (special Operations Squad) security forces
 uske chachaa abdul raashid daar kehete hai, ''2016 main adil skool main hi padhata tha tabhi esaoji ne usase naak ragadvaya tha, jiskaa khauf uske dimag main hameshaa bana rahaa
 "abdul Rashid's two sons also became militants
 ek to maaraa gaya or duusare ne hathiyaar se tauba kar lee he
 Whatever be the reality, Adil turned into a radical extremist 11 months after joining Jaish
 jo ladkaa parivaar kii aamadani badhaane main harsambhav madad kar rahaa tha, vah aisa khoonkhaar fidaayin ban gaya, jaisaa desh ne pehle kabhi nahin dekha tha
 That day Adil ('waqas Commando' among his Jaish comrades) clashed with a bus carrying CRPF personnel at Lethpora on jammu-srinagar highway carrying a Maruti Echo van loaded with explosives
 uskaa nishaanaa kuch zyada hi bada tha
 The CRPF had 2,547 personnel in a convoy of 78 vehicles
 unamem kai chhuttiyon se laute the
 Adil must have learned every detail of this particular part of NH-44 and may have practiced many times
 yah jagah kuch sunsaan he or sadak aisa tikhaa mode leti he ki badi gadipoon ko raftaar dhimi kerani padati he
 Such a place was chosen only to carry out major incidents
 anjaam hua bhi bheeshan
 The 45-seater CRPF bus turned into a small wreck
 usamen baithe javaanon ke avshesh kareeb 200 meter main bikhare pade the
 Five soldiers sitting in the front and back of the bus are battling to death in the army hospital in Srinagar
 janvari kii shuruyaat se hi aatanki guton ne srinagar or dakshin kashmir ke suraksha balon ke thikaanon or check pointon par grenade se kai hamale kiye
 Therefore, the vigil was increased in the Jawahar tunnel-srinagar portion of the highway
 lekin varisht adhikari kabool karte hai ki vaani kii maut ke baad 2017 kii shuruyaat main hi shuru kiye gaye 'oparation ol outy main kuch ''kamyaabiyon" ke baad susti aa gai thi
 They say that more than 600 militants were wiped out in this operation
 adil ne 10 minute ke video main yah baat kabuuli bhi, jise jaish-e-mohammad ne vaardaat ke kuch minuton baad hi viral kar diya
 In it, Adil, standing with the M4 carbine in front of the flag of jaish-e-mohammed, says, 'don't be deceived to kill some of our commanders and kill us
 ham tumhaara chaiyn uda denge
 "adil's involvement in the fidayeen squad indicates a very serious situation
 haalanki jaish-e-mohammad visphotak bhare vaahanon (vibiiidi) se ghati main kareeb saat hamale kar chukaa he, lekin yah duusari baar hi he ki koi sthaneey noujvaan fidaayin bana he
 Earlier, in April 2000, a 17-year-old student of Srinagar, Ashfaq Shah, was made fidayeen in an attack by a Maruti car loaded with explosives at the gates of the Army's 15 Corps headquarters at Badamibagh in Srinagar
 apane 'fidaayin' video main adil ne shah kii saraahna kii he
 The same year Masood Azhar created jaish-e-mohammed
 usne phir 25 disambar, 2000 ko duusari baar srinagar ke cantonment par hamalaa kiya
 In that attack, 24-year-old Mohammad Bilal, a resident of Birmingham, UK, blew himself up in a Maruti car loaded with explosives
 us visphot main sena ke paanch javaanon sahit 11 log maare gaye the
 But the example of Azhar's growing audacity was a car bomb attack on October 1, 2001, in the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly, in which 38 people were killed
 phir usee saal 13 disambar ko dilli main sansad bhawan par hamalaa hua
 Due to this, the Pakistani power system under the leadership of Pervez Musharraf at that time had distanced him
 darasal vidhansabha hamale par ghati main naaraazgi se pakistani videsh vibhaag bhi use 'dehshatgard vaardaat' bataane ko majaboor hua tha
 Things began to improve from 2003 onwards
 us samay jaish-e-mohammad ko pakistani suraksha pratishthan ne dur kar diya tha
 Jaish carried out two murderous attacks on Musharraf
 pakistan main lagaam lagane ke baad usee saal is gut ko doosraa jhatka ghati main laga jab biguef ne ghati main iske mukhiya shahbaaj khan urf gaji baba ko srinagar ke vaniyar ilaake main maar giraaya
 Then, Jaish was wiped out of the valley without the help of ISI
 khufia soochnaaon ke jariye suraksha balon ne gaji ke maare jane ke do saal ke bheetar uske puure caderon kaa safaya kar diya
 Intelligence officials regard the consignment of the intruders, who came twice a month after Wani was killed in August 2016, as the reason for Jaish's re-spread in Kashmir
 uske baad usne patankot hawaii thikaane or uri main sena ke brigade mukhyalay par dussahasik hamalaa kiya
 Intelligence officials see Jaish's escalating attacks as an attempt to give the isi's Hizbul Mujahideen and Lashkar a break
 oparation ol out main in donon guton ko kaaphi nuksaan jhelana padaa he
 In 2017, jaish-e-mohammed became active in the lead role of terrorist attacks in the valley
 nayaa sthaneey commander nur mohammad tantre urf nur traali kai sthaneey rangaruton kii bhartee karne main kaamyaab ho gaya
 Among these recruits were 16-year-old Fardeen Mohiuddin and 21-year-old Manzoor Baba, who attacked the CRPF camp on December 31, 2017, in a fidayeen
 yah shivi 14 farvari ke ghatnasthal ke kareeb hi he
 But despite spreading his foot in the valley, Jaish lost his hands to many big terrorists
 tantre disambar 2017 main maaraa gaya, uski jagah aayaa mufti vakaas bhi maaraa gaya
 Waqas was a Pakistani terrorist and attacked a military camp in Sunjwan in February 2018
 vakaas march 2018 main maaraa gaya
 Among the other terrorists killed in the encounter with the Special Security Force were Azhar's nephews Talha Rashid and Usman Ibrahim
 suraksha visheshgyon kaa kahana he ki ajahar ne apane bhatijon ko 'qurbaan' hone ke liye bhejkar sanket diya ki vah peeche hatane vaala nahin he
 Officials believe that such a precedent may also serve to create emotional boil among Kashmiri youth like Adil Dar
 darasal, jaish-e-mohammad kaa online saptahik alaklam lagaataar ghati ke naujavaanon ko afjal guru ke 'mishan' kii yaad dilaataa rahata he
 The current activism of Jaish came from the arrival of Ghazi Abdul Rashid Afghani in the valley at the end of last year
 ajahar kaa khasmkhas gaji afghanistan main taliban yuddh kaa ladaaka he
 According to intelligence reports, the twenty-three-year-old Ghazi entered Jammu along the other two fighters through the Pir Panjal hills
 police ke mutabik, baad main usase nau or bhi behad prashikshit or kattar ladaake aa jude
 The same group had an encounter three days after the Pulwama attack at Pingalina, 12 km from the site
 is golibari main ek major sahit chaar sainikon or jammu-kashmir police ke ek sipaahi kii maut ho gai thi
 Nine people were injured, including Brig Harveer Singh and South Kashmir Police DIG Amit Kumar
 sena ke sutara ise 2017 main shuru kiye gaye oparation ol out ke baad yah sabase 'mushkil muthbhed' thi
 Three terrorists were killed in this, in which Jaish commander Rashid and Ubaid were killed besides a local terrorist Hilal Ahmed Naik
 shuru main media reporton main kaha gaya ki gaji maaraa gaya lekin sutron ne bataaya ki yah khabar sahi nahin thi
 The problem is that there is little information about Ghazi and there are signs of a change in Jaish's strategy as well
 kathith taur par bam banane main maahir gaji ekadam jaruri na hone par vishesh police bal se takaraana nahin chahta
 He has also stopped the way of posting new recruits on social media after reaching here
 phir bhi, apana 'dussahas' dikhaane ke liye jaish ne gaji kii tasviren daaleen
 With this, the caption warns that 2019 is going to be the 'deadliest' year for India
 fidaayin hamalon kii shuruyaat 1980 ke dashak main lebanon main hijbullah ne kii thi

 haalanki 1980 ke dashak ke aakhir main yah mudda al kaayda main vivaad kaa vishay bhi bana
 Abdullah, the founding member of Al Qaeda, disagreed with Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-zawahiri in the case of adopting the fidayeen bomb blast as a way of Azzam jihad
 ain isi vajah se 1987 main afghanistan main ajjam, hafiz said or jafar ikbaal dwaara banaaya gaya lashkar fidaayin hamale ko khaarij karata rahaa he
 Despite this, Lashkar keeps sending the fidayeen fighters
