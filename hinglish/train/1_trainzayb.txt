 The Congress was going to directly accuse Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan and his family through a no-confidence motion in the state assembly
 is sthiti ko taalane ke liye bijepi ne ranneeti banaai or congress ko hi musiibat main daalkar unke upanetaa choudhary rakesh singh chaturvedi ko baghawat ke liye khadaa kar diya

 After adjourning the session without discussing the no-confidence motion, the politics of the state got heated and the opposition complained to the government to the Governor
 rajyapal ne mukhyamantri se lekar vidhansabhadhyaksh tak ko talab kar daalaa
 Everyone kept their eyes on the Raj Bhavan for a fortnight

 aisa isliye kyonki satr bulaane va na bulaane par sarkaar ko hi katghare main khadaa hona he
 The Governor's initiative is seen as a major failure of the government's strategists

 a history-chart prepared by DIU of India Today shows that if the Barkhal dried up completely in 1990, it was restored for a few years with seasonal rainwater
 lekin 2006 ke baad se iskaa pani gaayab hota chalaa gaya
 This destruction was not due to nature but due to human activities

 Significantly, on Monday, on the occasion of his 50th birthday, Shah Rukh Khan talked to Barkha Dutt on NDTV and said that intolerance in the country had increased

 Shahrukh Khan said that your opinion is respected in western countries
 lekin hamaare desh main, mujhe lagata he ki agar meri raay aapke saath nahin milti he to yah vivaad ko janm de detii he

 Our best wishes are with you Realme apane nae flagship smartphone Realme 3 Pro ko launch karne kii taiyaari main he
 This smartphone will be launched on 22 April during an event in New Delhi
 ab ek report se jaankaree mili he ki Realme 3 Pro ke saath ek entry level smartphone Realme C2 ko bhi launch karne vaali he
 This is the upgraded version of Realme C1, which was launched with Realme 2 Pro last year
 haalanki dhyaan rakhane vaali baat ye he ki company kii ore se is bare main koi jaankaree nahin di gai he
 Hopefully, the company will give some information about Realme C2 soon
 baharhaal launch se pehle 91mobiles ne apni report main kathith C2 ke kuch spacifications kii bhi jaankaree di he
 Sources have informed the publication that in the balance of Realme C1, more upgrades will be given in C2
 saath hi aapako bataa den Realme C1 (2019) ko bhi is saal janvari ke maheene main launch kiya gaya tha
 According to the report, the upcoming Realme C2 will get the Helio P22 processor
 jabaki C1 main snapadragon 450 procesar diya gaya tha
 Also, the report also states that an 8-megapixel camera will be given for a selfie in the upcoming smartphone
 jabaki si1 main 5 megapixl kaa camera selfi ke liye maujuud tha
 Talking about the battery, a 4,230amah battery can be given in this smartphone
 saath hi is smartphone ke android 9 pai besd coloros 6
 Expected to run at 0
 mili jaankaree ke mutabik Realme C2 kaa selfi camera waterdrop style noch main diya jayega
 That is, there will be much less bezels in it compared to the previous smartphone
 Realme C1 main iphone x jaisaa noch diya gaya tha
 Apart from this, it has been reported in the C2 that there will be 13 megapixels in the back panel and two cameras of 2 megapixels
 report main bataaya gaya he ki is smartphone kii keemat 8,000 rupee se shuru ho sakati he
 As far as launching is concerned, it is quite possible that the company will launch Realme C2 on this day because C1 was also launched as a surprise with Realme 2 Pro
 bhopal main aaj vishwa hindi sammelan kaa pradhanmantri narend modi ne udghaatan kiya
 After 32 years, the World Hindi Conference has been organized in India
 jisamen 39 deshon ke pratinidhi hissaa le rahe hai
 It was first organized in Nagpur in 1975, then again in 1983 in Delhi and then held abroad
 pradhanmantri ne kaha ki bhashaa main bhi chetana hoti he or hindi nahin aati to unka kya hota pataa nahin
 He emphasized the importance of Hindi
 2001 ke censos ke anusaar desh main sirf 41 pratishat logon kii matra bhashaa hindi he
 Our country has 122 languages, 1599 dialects, our country is called Youth Country
 66 pratishat log 35 saal se kam umr ke hai, 80 pratishat ke paas mobile phone he, 35 karod janata yani 28 pratishat internet kaa prayog karti he
 The larger section is active on social networking sites which use English more than Hindi

 He later said that this statement was taken without understanding the context

 The Giant Organizing Committee has 129 members but only 21 have a status in the international arena in literature, journalism or fine arts
 baaki 95 rajaneta yaa prashasnic afasar hai
 The chief is Sushma Swaraj, 8 teachers or vice-chancellors and 5 others who are not described
 sawaal uth rahe hai ki janemaane sahityakaron ko nimantran nahin diya gaya, unki andekhi ho rahi he
 According to one organizer, this event is not to discuss the achievements of poets but to brainstorm on how to bring Hindi into the national mainstream
 sansad ke is satr main yaad hoga, congress ke upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi kaa wo parchaa jisamen unhone hindi main apane bhaashan ke mahatvapurn bindu likhe the, lekin roman main
 Our youth uses Roman mostly in all social networking sites
 yaha bataa den ki roman main likhane kaa istemaal angreji hi nahin balkee german, french, mijo script main bhi hota he
 So is the government just insisting on speaking Hindi or on writing it too

 And if he also wants the status of the official language of India, then the question of language equality also arises

 It was said that some people save their benefit from such conferences, language does not benefit
 pradhanmantri ne apane mantriyon or afasaron ko kah diya he ki hindi main twit karen, lekin sarkaar ke khud ke kaaryakramon main angreji kaa prayog dikhataa he

 The Prime Minister said that there is also consciousness in the language and if Hindi does not come, then what happens to them does not know
 unhone hindi ke mahatv par jor diya
 According to the 2001 census, only 41 percent of the country's mother tongue is Hindi
 hamaare desh main 122 bhashaaen he, 1599 boliyaan hai, hamaara desh yuva desh kaha jaataa he

 So many questions are arising regarding this event

 The remaining 95 are politicians or administrative officers

 Questions are arising that eminent writers are not invited, they are being ignored

 On this occasion, he presented the RSS as an example to the activists
 pavaar ne kaha, 'aresas swayamsevak tab tak kisi kaa peechha nahin chodta, jab tak wo us aadmi yaa parivaar se khud baat na kar le
 In contrast, the NCP worker knocks the door of a family only once
 agar ghar par koi nahin he to duusari baar vahaan jane kaa ksht nahin uthta
 At the same time, Sharad Pawar also asked the workers to gear up for the upcoming assembly elections in Maharashtra
 vahiin loksabhaa chunaav 2019 me haar ke baad congress or ensipi ke vilay kii charchaaen kaaphi hui thi
 But these discussions came to an end when Sharad Pawar himself dismissed these speculations
 isko lekar sharad pavaar kaa kahana he ki ensipi kii apni ek pahchaan he or vah ise barkaraar rakhegi
 He says that the merger of the party with the Congress has been talked about by some journalists who do not want us to be with the allies
 darasal, loksabhaa chunaav parinaam ke baad congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi se pavaar kii mulaakaat ke baad ensipi ke congress main vilay kii atakalein shuru hui thim
 As the BJP grew in Maharashtra, the Shiv Sena was declining, the BJP was contesting 164 seats and the Shiv Sena contesting 124 seats
 In the politics of Maharashtra, the bjp-shiv Sena has been trying the electoral fortunes for the last three decades
 pichley teen dashak ke safar main bijepi gathbandhan main badhati rahi or shivasena pichhadati gai
 As a result of this, the Shiv Sena has entered the electoral fray as a junior partner in the alliance with BJP in the Maharashtra elections this time
 pradesh kii kul 288 vidhansabha siton main se bijepi 164 siton par chunaav lard rahi he to shivasena 124 siton par kismat aajamaa rahi he
 While the foundation of the alliance between the two was laid 29 years ago, Shiv Sena contested 183 seats and BJP 104 seats
 bataa den ki maharashtra kii raajnneetik main maratha asmita or ugr hindutv ko lekar bala sahab thakare ne shivasena kaa gathan 1966 main kiya or bijepi 1980 main bani thi
 In this way, if we look at the history of the alliance of BJP and Shiv Sena in Maharashtra, we started fighting together with the 1984 Lok Sabha elections
 haalanki shivasena ne yah chunaav bijepi ke chunaav chinh par ladaa tha, kyonki us samay uske paas apana nishaan nahin tha
 The role of Shiv Sena's elder brother bjp-shiv Sena tried his luck in the 1990 assembly elections for the first time
 us samay shivasena ne 183 siton or bijepi ne 104 siton par chunaav ladaa tha
 In this, BJP got 42 seats and Shiv Sena got 52 seats
 is tarah se shivasenamaharashtra main bijepi ke bade bhaiki bhoomika main rahi
 After this, in the 1995 assembly elections, the two parties again joined the electoral fray
 is baar shivasena ne bijepi ko ek seat zyada di, jisamen bijepi 105 or shivasena khud 183 seat par chunaav ladi
 In this, Shiv Sena got 73 seats and BJP 65 seats
 is tarah se donon ne milakar pehali baar maharashtra main sarkaar banaai or mukhyamantri kii kursi par shivasena virajman hui thi
 In the 1999 assembly election, BJP shared 117 seats and Shiv Sena 161 seats in the seat sharing formula in NDA
 is baar bijepi ne 56 aurashivesna ne 69 siton par jeet darjki thi
 This time the bjp-shiv Sena alliance lost power, but one thing became clear that the BJP was growing and the Shiv Sena was decreasing
 iske baad 2004 ke vidhansabha chunaav main shivasena 163 or bijepi 111 siton par chunaav ladi
 Shiv Sena got 62 seats and BJP 54 seats
 is baar ke chunaav main bijepi ne shivasena ko saadhe rakhane ke liye pichhali baar ke mukabre 6 kam siton par ladi thi
 The BJP changed its strategy, while, in the 2009 assembly elections, the Shiv Sena contested 169 and BJP 119 seats under the seat sharing formula
 bijepi 46 siten or shivasena 44 siten jeetne main kaamyaab rahi thi
 bjp's confidence was boosted by fighting more seats and winning more seats
 isi kaa nateeja tha ki 2014 ke vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi ne shivasena kii sharton par samjhauta nahin kiya donon partiyon ne alag-alag chunaav ladaa
 BJP won 122 seats fighting 260 seats and Shiv Sena could win only 63 seats by fighting 282 seats
 bijepi apane dam par sarkaar nahin bana pai
 After this, the Shiv Sena joined him and then the two formed the government together and the BJP took over the post of Chief Minister
 ab ek baar phir donon milakar chunavi ran main utre hai, lekin bijepi ab bade bhai kii bhoomika main he or shivasena junior partner ke taur par kismat aajamaa rahi he
 It remains to be seen who wins the contest in this year's election battlefield
 'mastijade' kii shooting shuru hone vaali thi or sani leyoni ne apane kairactor ke liye taiyaariyaan shuru kar di thim
 In which special care was taken on fitness
 sani ko apane kairactor ke liye bhi jamakarmehanat kerani padi or feet dikhne ke liye kuch zyada hi kasarat kerani thi
 But the shock came when she reached the set when her stylist told that she would have to take her fitness to a new level as her wardrobe of the film would have only 2 dresses, a pair of shorts and crop tops and 27 bikinis
 sani kii haalat lagbhag rone vaali ho gai kyonki unhen iske liye apane pasandida pizza ko tyaagna padataa
 Not only this, Saniyah was also wondering, what kind of a film is this wardrobe like? Sunny did not shoot a single scene that day

 It was decided that everyone on the set would take a similar diet
 yahi nahin sani ke is iraade ko parakhane kii bhi koshish kii gai or kai baar unke hotel ke kamare ke daravaaje par pizza ke slis bhi rakh die gaye

 ye jagajaahir he ki goa pradhanmantri narendra modi ke liye behad saubhagyashaalee rahaa he
 When there was talk of removing him from the Chief Minister of Gujarat after the Gujarat riots, it was only at the 2002 BJP National Executive meeting in Goa that the entire party stood behind him
 pichley saal goa main hui bijepi kaaryakarini kii baithak main unhen chunaav samiti kii kaman saunp kar pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar ke rup main aage badhaayaa gaya tha
 After becoming Prime Minister, Modi's first visit outside Delhi was also in Goa
 parrikar is puri tasviir main modi ke saath kuch baad main najar aae
 In 2009, there was complete preparation to make him the President of BJP
 magar tab laal krishna adwani ko ‘purana achaar’ bataane vaale unke vivaadaaspad bayaan se maamla latak gaya
 Later he became the Chief Minister of Goa and kept making headlines regarding his statements
 saaf-suthri, eemaandaar magar aakraamak chhavi ke liye parrikar mashhoor rahe hai
 He has been praised for his work and simplicity
 rajya main wo aam logon ke hi bich rahete hai
 He can be seen walking with the rest of the people on the road
 iaiti se nikal kar mukhyamantri kii kursi sanbhaalane vaale ve desh ke pehle netaa hai
 Parrikar has done strong politics in Goa
 acchhee khaasi sankhya ke isai vot vaale is rajya main parrikar ne party ko takat dilaa kar rashtriya swayamsevak sangh kaa dil jeeta
 Gaur Saraswat Brahmin Parrikar has become the Chief Minister of this state twice
 raajnneetik asthirataa, jod-tod or dhan bal ke liye kukhyat goa kii raajnneeti main apni ek alag pahchaan banaai he
 As a skilled administrator, he has also made a mark in the state
 rajya main piesi ke adhyaksh ke taur par avaidh khanan ghotaalon ke kai pahaluon ko janata ke saamne laakar unhone apni chhavi banaai
 Initially, Parrikar was not ready to come to Delhi
 haalanki unhen kaaphi din pehle pradhanmantri modi ne kaha tha ki wo dilli aa kar raksha mantralay sanbhaalein
 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley was in poor health and could not come to office for about a month
 ye shuru se hi tay tha ki jetali ko raksha mantralay kaa prabhaar asthai taur par diya ja rahaa he
 Modi again told him at the oath taking ceremony of Devendra Fadnavis in Mumbai
 or buudhvaar ko saare kaam chhod kar wo pradesh adhyaksh or sanghathan sachiv ke saath dilli aae jahaan unhen saaf kar diya gaya ki unhen ab raksha mantri kii zimmedaari sanbhaalani hogi
 Modi has chosen Parrikar very thoughtfully
 sarkaar main wo mantriyon kaa chunaav kota system nahin balki yogyata ke aadhaar par karnaa chaahate hai
 He realizes that he may have been in a hurry to select his ministers in May and that is why there is talk of some ministers being cut down
 lekin raksha mantri ke rup main parrikar ko dilli aana unamem modi ke bharose ko bhi dikhaata he
 Parrikar openly supported him in the journey of making Modi the Prime Minister
 adwani kii naaraazgi ko darkinar karte hue parrikar lagaataar modi ko pradhanmantri ko ummidavaar ghoshit karne kii maang karte rahe
 At the Goa National Executive meeting last year, he had also demanded that Modi be declared the Prime Ministerial candidate instead of making him head of the campaign committee
 nai zimmedaari ke saath parrikar kaa kad bahut ooncha ho gaya he
 As defense minister, he will become one of the top five leaders of the government
 wo cabinet kii raksha maamalon kii samiti yani sisie ke sadsy rahenge
 Two other former BJP presidents, Nitin Gadkari and m Venkaiah Naidu, who were in the government, could not get this honor
 china or pakistan ke saath seemaa par tanaav unki badi chunauti hogi
 Implementing the decisions that Jaitley has taken for the modernization of the army as well as the task of purchasing new weapons will also be handed over to him

 Congress headquarters, which came after handing over the memorandum to the PM
 Actually, it is an all party guard party from Hyderabad, which sat on a dharna at jantar-mantar with its demands for cow protection, then came directly to the Congress headquarters giving a memorandum to PM Modi
 is dal ke sansthaapak rajarshi dharmaveer jaipal kehete hai ki, modi sarkaar kaa aadha kaarykaal biit gaya, par ham gaurakshak jo badi ummid lagaae the wo puri nahin hui
 So now we have come to the Congress headquarters that the Congress sitting in the opposition should at least raise their demands in Parliament, so that the Modi government is forced to take action
 govadh par puri tarah roak kii maasapane gyaapan main is gaurakshak dal kii maang he ki, jaise maansaahaari jaanavar baagh ko rashtriya pashu ghoshit kiya gaya he
 In the same way, the vegetarian animal cow should also be declared a national animal
 saath hi govadh par puri tarah desh bhar main bain laga diya jaye
 This party says that, for the first time, the state governments of the Congress had banned cow slaughter for the first time, Indira Gandhi herself also supported it
 isliye aaj ke daur main congress ko unki is maang par saath dena chahie
 According to the General Guards Team, the time to meet Karna Singh and Digvijay Singh was taken for special reason, in the olden times, all the Muslim rulers had imposed a ban on cowherds, Hindu kings were considered cow devotees and their priests
 aise main rajgaraane se taalluk rakhane vaale karn singh or digvijay singh se is dal ko khaas ummid he ki, wo rahul gandhi se baat kar maamle ko sansad main uthaaenge
 By the way, this team wants to meet Digvijay and remind him of his statement which he gave to Aaj Tak
 digvijay ne kaha tha ki, wo chaahate hai ki, gohatya par sampoorn bain lagaaya jaae
 Digvijay will meet on Wednesday, in the office of Dalfilal Karan Singh and Digvijay Singh, this guard team has asked for time by submitting a memorandum
 donon netaa dilli se baahar hai
 But immediately from the office of Digvijay Singh, he has been asked to come to meet Digvijay on Wednesday
 ab ye buudhvaar ko aakar digvijay se milakar apana gyaapan denge
 Digvijay told 'aaj Tak' on this matter that, he is firm on his statement on cow slaughter, but only after meeting this guard team and seeing his memorandum, he will be able to give his response

 'if Muslims are only used for politics, then their development will never happen
 jab tak unka vot bank raajnneeti ke liye istamaal hota rahegaa musalamaanon kaa koi bhavishya nahin he
 Balasaheb Thackeray once said that Muslims should take away voting rights
 unhone jo kaha vah sahi tha
 'shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut has argued this in an article published in the party's mouthpiece Saamana
 matdaan kaa adhikaar vyaktigat hota he, saamudayik yaa dharmik aadhaar par nahin diya gaya he
 If a person is found to be involved in a criminal case, punished then the right to vote can be withdrawn, as in 1999, the Election Commission allowed Shiv Sena founder Bal Thackeray to contest elections and Was denied the right to vote
 agar sanjay raut kii daleel maane to kya bal thakare ke saath-saath us puure samudaay ko matdaan ke adhikaar se vanchit kar diya janaa chahie tha, jisaki kshetreey pahchaan kii raajnneeti kar rahe the
 Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Raut, while writing about Sena's newspaper Saamna taking away voting rights from Muslims, did not get the idea that he too is accused of politics of religion
 kya vah muslim vot bank kaa myth banaakar ek hindu votbank nahin banaate hai? jabaki raajnneetik sach yahi he ki hindu or musalmaan donon apane apane hisaab se alag-alag dalon ko vot karte hai
 If not, then in India there would be only four parties on the basis of Hindu, Muslim, Sikh and Christian
 vaise shivasena kaa ek bihari sau beemaari kaa naaraa to log bhul hi gaye honge
 Now, who should ask Sanjay Raut ji if you talk about Marathi manush, does not his party make a separate vote bank
 kya isi vajah se marathi maanush kaa puraa vikaas nahin hua he, jo vidarbha main rose aatmahatyaayein kar rahaa he
 By the way, Sanjay Raut has objected to the politics of vote bank, then he should have written in this article against the Dalit vote bank, backward vote bank, very backward vote bank, and tell all these communities to be denied the right to vote
 was supposed
 main tab bhi matdaan ke adhikaar le liye jane kii baat kii aalochana karata, lekin ek baar ke liye sochataa ki votbank bahut ho chukaa
 Can Sanjay Raut dare to say so? har jati kii koi na koi party he or netaa he, jo uske naam par endie sarkaar main sahyogi bhi he or mantri bhi
 You cannot choose vote bank politics on the basis of religion only at your convenience and that too on a day when voting is going on in a by-election in Mumbai, you do not write such an article
 is lekh kaa makasad jitna muslim vot bank par hamalaa karnaa nahin he usase kahin zyada iske bahaane hindu vot back ko sangathit karnaa he
 By the way, many non-muslims will also not vote for the Shiv Sena, so did they all fall under Owaisi's deception
 har baat isliye sahi nahin ho jaati he wo duusare kii pratikriya main kahi ja rahi he
 Sanjay Raut has written an article with reference to the statements of the Owaisi brothers of All India Majlis Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM)
 agar ovaisi unhen hyderabad aane kii chunauti de rahe hai to bilkul chale janaa chahie
 Who are the Owaisis who are challenging anyone to come to their city
 sanjay raut kehete hai ki kya hyderabad bharat kaa hissaa nahin he
 If i were, i would say that Uddhav Thackeray, you go to Hyderabad
 dekhte hai koun roktaa he
 It also asks if Owaisi has said that he will not allow you to enter Hyderabad or has given a political challenge
 nitish kumaar bhi narendra modi ko chunauti diya karte the ki bihar aakar dekh lijie
 This is Bihar, your politics will not work here
 lekin chal gai narendra modi kii
 Yet no one associated this challenge of Nitish with religion
 ovaisi kii chunauti ko dharm se joda ja rahaa he
 Owaisi's politics also has the same problem as your politics
 donon se ek duusare ko phayda pahunch rahaa he
 The point of Muslims being backward is not because of any vote bank politics
 yah sarkaron kii naakaami ke kaaran he
 This does not mean that other communities have grown too much and they do not have many symptoms of poverty and disease
 agar aisa hota to assi fisadi gaiyr muslim aabaadi ko viksit ghoshit kar diya jaataa
 India would have become the only country in the world where only fifteen percent of the population has not developed
 itnaa viksit to america yaa landan bhi nahin hoga
 Discrimination in government schemes is also a special kind of votebank politics
 sanjay raut saansad hai or centre or maharashtra main bijepi sarkaar ke sahyogi hai
 BJP has criticized this statement of Sanjay Raut
 lekin yahi ekmaatr bayaan nahin he
 Swami-sannyasis of Vishwa Hindu Parishad are making anti-muslim statements
 jabaki pradhanmantri ne lalakila se das saal ke liye aise bayanon or raajnneeti ko multavee karne kii apil kii thi
 Their appeal has failed in their own organizations
 dilli ke vigyaan bhawan main unhone kaha tha ki har kisi ko apni marji or bina kisi bhay se apane apane dharmon ke paalan kaa adhikaar he
 Even in Paris, he said that our government will not discriminate
 vakt aa gaya he ki ve bhi in bayaan dene vaale netaaon yaa inke sanghathanon ke pramukhon se sidhe baat karen
 This is what i have to say to the Naxalites of hate
 
 
 
 "make the trees that are drying up fruitful, end hatred, love love make love" --- My Hindustan is not a jungle of Taliban thinking, it is a chaman of human values, constitutional values, no hate polluted air can affect it
 aaj ke hi indian express main khabar he ki kendriya mantri mukhtaar abbaas nakvi janvari se 9 rajyon ke alpsankhyakon ke saath baithken kar chuke hai
 Many have gone twice to states so that mistrust is not spread
 yah ek bahut hi acha prayaas he
 But if these statements are not stopped by doing so, then Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi should stop traveling to the states and meet mps of Vishwa Hindu Parishad and Shiv Sena
 samay or kharchaa donon batch jayega
 If someone is making a statement about the sterilization of Muslims, then to take away the voting rights
 aise bayaan dene waalon se nakvi sahab ko milanaa chahie
 During the Lok Sabha elections, there were many attacks on political agreements in the name of secularism
 unamem ek kism kaa atvaad to tha magar yah sachai bhi thi dharmanirpekshata ke naam par khokhli raajnneeti hoti rahi he or har kism kii naakaami par pardaa daalane kaa yah zariyaa ban gaya he
 For this, social media coined the word 'secular' which gradually became a weapon to attack secular thinking while attacking secular politics
 secularism ke naam par raajnneeti kii aalochana ek baat he magar koi raajnneeti se secularism ko hi mitaa dene kii vakaalat kar rahaa he to yah behad khatarnaak he
 If secularism was so useless, then BJP would not use positive secularism in the posters of its membership campaign
 iskaa ek matlab to yahi hoga ki ham sabakaa vikaas karenge, lekin yah jo bayaan he kya vah bhi sabakaa vikaas ke frem main aata he
 The time has come to create another word like Secular so that it can be attacked against the thinking which is against being secular
 jo ek samudaay ko vot bank kii tarah peshkar apana ek alag or usase bada votbank bananaa chahta he
 In the coming days, statements are being made about forging religious identity
 mujhe kai baar lagata tha ki sicular raajnneeti par hamalaa karne vaale ve log hai jo sabko barabari se dekhnaa chaahate hai
 We want to move away from the compromise politics of the past and look at it from a new perspective
 inhen sicular virodhiyon se poocha janaa chahie ki ve is tarah ke bayanon ko kaise dekhte hai
 Secular has the English sik which means sick
 kya ab jo bayaan die ja rahe hai vah biimaar soch nahin hai
 Do they have any word for all these things or till then they would like to work only from communal
 tab tak kyon na sanjay raut se hi matdaan kaa adhikaar waapas le liya jaae? The Defense Research and Development Organization (DRDO) successfully test-fired the indigenously designed air-to-air All Weather 'astra Missile'

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP President Amit Shah are getting credit for the overwhelming majority that the Bharatiya Janata Party got in Uttar Pradesh
 lekin parde ke peeche se bijepi ke liye 'chanakya' ke taur par kaam karne vaale sunil bansal ko bhi is jeet kaa utana hi shrey jaataa he
 When Prime Minister Narendra Modi was stepping out of Gujarat into Delhi politics, he entrusted the responsibility to Amit Shah for Uttar Pradesh
 usee samay amit shah ne rajasthan main abivipi ke sadsy sunil bansal ko amit shah kendriya raajnneeti main laaye or ahm jimmedaari di

 Tejashwi Yadav, former Deputy Chief Minister of Bihar, attacked Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, saying that under the leadership of Nitish ji, the dreaded Ganges of corruption is flowing in Bihar
 is bhrashtachari rupi ganga kaa pravaah itnaa tej he ki bade-bade ghotaale baandh tod rahe hai
 Tejashwi Yadav said that the Banbandh and the canal broke down in Kahalgaon, Bhagalpur at a cost of 828 crores two days ago

 Tejashwi said that Nitish ji, who talks big about morality, does not take any cognizance of the scams in the Water Resources Department? What are their compulsions, which turn a blind eye to the corruption of this department
 ek mukhyamantri ke liye isse badi prashasnic vifaltaa kya hogi? jo unkeudghaatan karne semhaz kuch ghanten pehle hi janata kaa 828 karod rupee bhrashtachar kii ganga main bah jaataa he
 Thousands of crores of scams are being exposed daily to the Chief Minister who talks about zero tolerance
 phir bhi pataa nahin kis naitikta ke aadhaar par eemaandaaree kaa dhol peetate rahete hai
 Tejashwi said that now even the fair people of Bihar have started saying that as long as there was no scam in the RJD government
 rajd badi party thi or usamen nitish ji ke bhrasht sipahsalaaron ko ghotaale karne kii chhot nahin thi, shaayad isliye unka dam ghut rahaa tha

 The BCCI called an executive meeting on Sunday and simply showed its helplessness in the press conference after the meeting
 rajasthan royles spot phixing maamle main giraftaar apane teen cricketron ke khilaaf criminal cese darj karegaa, lekin bisisiai ne kaha ki vah daagi tikdi ko sajaa dene ke liye niyamon kaa anupaalan karegi
 However, Srinivasan made a promise that if the players were found guilty, strict action would be taken against them
 bisisiai ne apni bhrashtachar nirodhak ikai (anti karpshan unit) ke pramukh ravi saavnee ko jaanch ayukta niyukt kiya
 They have been asked to submit their report at the earliest
 shrinivasana ne kaha, ‘hamane rajasthan royles ke maalikon ko bhi aamantrit kiya tha
 His management attended the meeting and informed the executive about the incident
 hamen bataaya gaya ki ve teenon khilaadiyon ke khilaaf police main shikaayat darj karwaanaa chaahate hai
 He said, 'he is innocent until someone is convicted
 bisisiai kisi ko nahin bachaa rahaa he lekin hamaari karrwai saaf suthri honi chahie
 We will follow the rules
 yadi kisi ko doshi paaya jaataa he to ham kadi karrwai karenge
 'srinivasan said,' This (investigation) will be completed as soon as possible
 yah aantarik jaanch hogi
 We may need some information from the police
 baaki saavnee par nirbhar he lekin jaanch jald se jald puri kii jaaegi
 We will look at all aspects of natural justice
 hamaari apni niyamavali he or bisisiai kii apni pranali he
 Regarding curbing corruption, the BCCI chief said that the board will appoint each IPL franchise along with the security officer and the anti-corruption officer to monitor the activities of the players
 unhone iske saath hi kaha ki board ab khilaadiyon ke agent ko manyata pradaan karegaa
 Srinivasan said, 'the executive has decided that all the agents of the players will be recognized by the BCCI
 prayek team ke saath suraksha adhikari ke alaava asiesu (bhrashtachar nirodhak evam suraksha ikai) adhikari hoga
 He said, "the activities of the players will be monitored
 isisi asiesu ke pramukh isse nibatane ke liye bisisiai ko aavashyak kadam uthaane ke liye upaay bataaenge
 Srinivasan said that the board does not have the resources to curb bookies and can only monitor the activities of the players
 unhone kaha, ‘ham khilaadiyon ko kisi had tak niyantrit kar sakate hai lekin kanoon lagu karne vaali agency kaa kaam nahin kar sakate
 There is nothing we can do when it comes to controlling the bookies
 is tarah ke toornamenton main khilaadiyon par nigaraanee rakhane or satarkta ko majboot karne ke liye vistrut gyaapan bhi mujhe saunpa gaya he
 'srinivasan said,' The Executive was informed about the steps taken by ACSU to educate the players of all the teams before the tournament
 ’ bisisiai ne in khilaadiyon ko nilambit kar diya he
 They have been charged under sections 420 (cheating) and 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC
 board ne pratham shrenee cricketer amit singh ko bhi nilambit kar diya he jo ab kathith rup se satoria he
 He was arrested on May 16 along with 10 other bookies
 shrinivasana ne in baton ko bhi nakaar diya ki isisi se chetavanee milane ke baavjood board ne bhrashtachar ke khilaaf kadam nahin uthaaye
 He said, 'ICC ACSU confirmed today that they had not told me anything
 yah soochna sahi nahin he
 He claimed that the board had not received any information in this matter from the Delhi Police
 shrinivasana ne kaha, ‘ham khilaadiyon par lagu hone vaale niyamon ke hisaab se chalenge
 We have also requested the police to provide information to complete our investigation
 hamane is sambandh main dilli police ko bhi madad kii peshkash kii he
 If the players are found guilty, we will not hesitate to take ruthless action
 ’shrinivasana ne kaha ki board khilaadiyon ke khilaaf shikaayat darj karne kaa adhikari nahin he kyonki ve rajasthan rails se anubandhit hai
 He said, 'we were advised that the BCCI cannot lodge an FIR
 frenchiji aisa karegi
 We will follow the report of the Disciplinary Committee
 ’board pramukh ne iske saath hi kaha ki dilli police ne unhen giraftaar kiye gayi khilaadiyon se itar anya khilaadiyon kii bhagidaari ke bare main jaankaree nahin di he
 He said, "this is a question related to three players who allegedly did the wrong thing in the form of spot fixing
" jahaan tak bisisiai kaa sawaal he to ham jaanch ayog kii report ke anusaar chalenge
 We will not hesitate to take action but we will only take action against the guilty persons
 ’unhone kaha, ‘ham isisi asiesu kii sevaayen le rahe hai
 They are monitoring the tournament
 hamaare paas peshewar log nahin hai
 Srinivasan said that the system of educating the players will be strengthened to prevent corruption
 unhone kaha, ‘hamaari pehle hi niyamavali he
 The ICC is monitoring ACSU
 satr shuru hone se pehle unhone sabhi khilaadiyon ko kya karnaa he or kya nahin he, ke bare main bataaya tha
 It is not that nothing has been done
 ’shrinivasana ne kaha, ‘khilaadiyon ne un farm par hastakshar kiye hai jinamein kaha gaya he ki ve sab kuch samajhate hai
 After this there was nothing left to do
 main pehle se anumaan nahin laga saktaa
 We can take action only after getting the report
 ham saaf kar dena chaahate hai ki ham kadi se kadi karrwai karne main nahin hichkichaayenge
 We will also strengthen our education program
 ’shrinivasana ne is sankat ke liye khilaadiyon par nijee taur par doshi tehraana jari rakhaa
 He said, 'the mistake was due to the greediness of the players
 ham sattebaaji ko prashray nahin dete
 We do not promote anything
 bharat main sattebaaji vaid nahin he, police karrwai karegi
 The board chief also defended the IPL
 unhone kaha ki prashansakon kii baari upasthiti se sabit ho gaya he ki toornament is sankat se ubar jayega
 He said, 'BCCI and IPL are being whipped fiercely for the last three to four days as if the whole world is over
 sachai yah he ki keval teen khilaadiyon par galat karne ke aarope lage hai
 ipl's brand equity will not be affected
 ham darshakon ke abhaari hai ki ve ab bhi match dekhne ke liye aa rahe hai
 "srinivasan was asked whether corruption can be curbed by legalizing betting," he said, "legalizing betting is a different matter
" duusare deshon main yah vaid he isse madad milti he lekin bharat ke bare main main nahin jaanata
 The board chief was again asked about the allegations of the IPL sacked commissioner Lalit Modi that he had warned about fixing in the IPL
 shrinivasana ne kaha, ‘durbhaagya se main modi par tippanee karne kii sthiti main nahin hum
 Investigation is going on against Modi and it would not be right for me to say anything
 niti ke anusaar main modi ko koi jawaab nahin detaa
