 maharashtra kii raajnneeti main pichley 40 saal se bada kad rakhane vaale ensipi adhyakshasharad pavaarane kaha he ki alge saal hone vaale aam chunaav mensatta parivartanhoga
 From the stage of Aaj Tak's special program 'mumbai Manthan', Sharad Pawar said that Narendra Modi will not be the Prime Minister after the elections in 2019
 2019 main centre or maharashtra main hone vaale chunaav main koun chunaav jitegaa? is sawaal par pavaar ne kaha ki aaj jinke haath main hukumat he, agle saal ve satta main nahin rahenge
 The government will change both at the center and the state
 pavaar ne 2004 main hue aam chunaav kaa zikr karte hue kaha ki agle saal bhi aisi hi sthiti hogi
 He indicated that a coalition government would be formed again
 pradhanmantri banane ke sawaal par pavaar ne kaha ki 2004 main manmohan singh pradhanmantri banenge, ye koun soch saktaa tha
 In the same way anyone can be created again
 kisi ek kaa naam nahin liya ja saktaa
 On the question of Chidambaram not projecting Rahul Gandhi as PM, he said that this is the fact

 Congress just wants change

 apane pehle hi match main varun ne khaas chhap chodi or 6
 Won three wickets for 24 runs in 1 over spell
 ye teenon hi wicket bold ke rup main the
 After these great ODI debut, it did not take much time for Varun to make a place in the Test team
 november 2011 main westeindies ke khilaaf unhone test kariyar shuru kiya, isamen ve pehali pari main 106 ran dekar teen wicket lene main safal rahe
 Despite this effective debut in international cricket, Varun has been in and out of the Indian team
 iskaa kaaran chotil hone ke alaava unke pradarshan main sthirataa kaa abhaav rahaa
 You can consider Varun to be a bowler who has great speed, but sometimes he is very expensive due to not being accurate
 yadi unki gati main sateekta rupi 'asr' (del sten kii hi tarah) bhi shaamil ho jaae to varun aise gendbaaj ban sakate hai jinhen har captain apni team main rakhana chahega
 Varun Aaron, a right-arm fast bowler, has played 9 Tests and as many odis in a nearly five-year Test and ODI career
 test main 52
 18 at an average of 61 and 38 in odis
 09 ke ausat se 11 wicket unke naam par hai
 Naturally, to ensure a place in Team India, Varun needs to perform even better
 
 
 international cricket main is prabhavi aagaaj ke baavjood varun bhartiya team se andar-baahar hote rahe hai
 The reason for this was the lack of consistency in his performance apart from injury
 varun ko aap aisa gendbaaj maan sakate hai jiske paas jabardast gati to he, lekin kai baar sateek nahin hone ke kaaran ve behad mahange sabit hote hai
 If his pace also includes 'asra' (like Dale Steyn) of accuracy, Varun can become a bowler whom every captain would like to have in his team
 kareeb paanch saal ke test or vanade kariyar main daaen haath ke tej gendbaaj varun eron ne 9 test or itane hi vanade khele hai

 He has 11 wickets at an average of 09

 This feeling of self-realization and contemplation was seen throughout the day
 satr ke agle hisse main jab bollywood ke bade sitare sanjay dutt manch par aae to unhen bhi isi tarah ke kathin sawaal kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 But instead of avoiding the question, he courageously accepted his responsibility
 unhone kaha, ''college main mujhe drug lene kii aadat pad gai thi
 i was used to it
 mujhe isse ubarne main das saal kaa vakt laga
 i am lucky that i had the means available to overcome it

 But then you get addicted to it
 
 
 (yah itnaa bura ho jaataa he ki) koi gadhaa mar jaae to bhi aap pite hai, koi kutta mar jaae to bhi aap pite hai
 After this, when young star Varun Dhawan came on stage, he too could not avoid such sharp questions
 unase unke sicks pack ke bare main poochhate hue kaha gaya ki kya ve bheed ke saamne apni shart utarkar apana sicks pack dikhaaenge? maano bhoomikaayen ulat gai hon, kyonki ang-pradarshan karnaa aam taur par mahilaon kaa kshetra hota he
 However, the craze of the crowd had reached its peak

 Many had hand-written signboards and they were being waved to Varun
 sabhi sinboard par ghuma-firaakar yahi darshaya ja rahaa tha ki ''main varun dhawan se pyaar karti hum
 Comedian Kunal Kamra described the animal-like lust that has brought down the so-called 'babas' spread in our country
 (is vishay par unki choti-si salaah thi 'downlod tinder')
 He explained an interesting reason why comedians like him have to face so much hateful resentment
 unhone kaha, ''stand-ap kamedi ke saath samasya yah he ki jab aap mike main bolte hai to dekhne waalon ko lagata he ki jaise unase sidhi baat kii ja rahi he or khud unka majaak udaaya ja rahaa he—phir ve mujhe gaaliyaan dene lagate hai
 In a later session Vivek Oberoi spoke on a disputed topic and that was censorship
 ek websiries main abhinay karne ke apane faisle ke bare main baat karte hue unhone kaha, ''isamen sabase santoshjanak baat yah he ki aapako pehlaaj nihlani kaa saamana nahin karnaa padataa
 a theme repeatedly emerged in the program: nepotism
 yah saamaajik samasya hamaare desh main sabhi kshetron main dekhi jaati he—bollywood se lekar sansad tak
 Smriti Irani raised it ("this is also the problem with people from working families"

 '' or sansthagat sahyog ke bare main sawaal kaa jawaab dete hue goswami ne kaha, ''bisisiai kaa sahyog pichley kuch varshon se badha he or agar aap pichley chaar-paanch varshon main mahila cricket ko dekhen to yah sahi disha main aage bad rahaa he

 Very interesting thing

 Mutuvel Karunanidhi called Rahul Gandhi's father and Sonia Gandhi's husband, former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi a "respectable person"
 to kya isiilie karunanidhi ke doston ne do dashak pehle rajeev kii hatya kar di thi? karunanidhi kii naitik aacharan samhita main sammanjanak vyakti kya isi gati ko praapt hota he
 Tiru Karunanidhi may even object to being called a friend of Perarivalan, Santan and Murugan
 in teenon hatyaron ko rajeev gandhi kii jaan lene ke aarope main maut kii sajaa ho chuki he
 Would they like that the status of a friend be reduced to "hamdard / Kharekhwah"? If Karunanidhi could just shake the earth and sky in an effort to save his sympathetic killers, imagine that a murderous friend They will shake the universe while trying to save it
 yahaan agar main thodaa bhramit lag rahaa houn to mujhe maaf kijiegah ab to main un sidhe-saral shabdon ke bhi arth nahin samaj paa rahaa hum, jo maut kii sajaa par chal rahi saarvajanik bahason main uchhaale ja rahe hai
 The debate is whether the killers of Rajiv Gandhi should be hanged or punished by the coalition of leaders, lawyers, and yes, sympathizers, to defer the punishment that has been meted out overwhelmingly by the nexus of the leaders
 kanoon ke nirdhaarit praavdhaanon ke tahat kaaphi soch-vichaar ke baad di gai maut kii sajaa un logon ke liye bhala galat kaise he, jinhone hindustan ke ek purv pradhanmantri kii hatya kii yojana banaai or use karyanvit kiya, mahaj isliye ki ve uske ek siyaasi faisle se sahamat nahin the?karunanidhi saidhantik taur par mrityudand kii sajaa khatm karne ke hami hon, aisa nahin he varanaa is maamle ke alaava bhi aisi sajaa ke khilaaf unhone baqayada abhiyaan chalaaya hota
 He is only interested in seeing Rajiv Gandhi's killers alive
 yah koi bhi nahin kah rahaa ki lambii adalati prakriya main kahin koi khami rah gai
 No one says that sentencing judges have violated the limits of the law
 raham baratane kaa karunanidhi kaa aagrah is ek dhundhale tark par tikaa he ki ''unhone 20 saal kii sajaa pehle hi kaat lee he
 "this can be very good news for any murderer
" 20 kii vay main agar vah kisi kaa katl karata he to sajaa kaatane tak vah 40 kaa hoga, maujuuda siyaasi paimaane par yah to yuvavastha kii umr he or uske baad vah sukun kii bhari-puri jindagi jeene ke liye taiyaar hoga, jab tak ki uuparavaala hi uskaa farmaan na jari kar de
 If the leaders find the death penalty to be so inhumane, then they should have the ability to change the law
 jab tak kanoon he, vah apana kaam karegaa hi
 If his path leads to the planks of death then take it
 dilli main chaatro ke ek virdohi dal ne is faisle ko nyaayik katl kehete hue uskaa virodh kiya
 An imaginary poster said, "justice, end political vendetta
" '' nyaay kii choukhat se nikal bhaagna kab se nyaay ho gaya bhala?siyaasi pratishodh? yah muhaavara haalanki ek pahalu ko saaf karata he
 Indirectly there is a confession that the murder was not a sentimental emotional crime but a well-planned political decision
 bhartiya rajya kii pratikriya waisi nahin thi, jaisi ki julius si
 On the murder of Zar, Mark Antony had expressed: 'no good for anyone who commits a brutal act
 '' bharat kii pratikriya lambii, paardarshee, kachua chaal vaali thi
 a lot of delays were made, which is now being adopted to save the culprits
 bees saal kii jail ko paryaapt sajaa maanane vaale shaayad un dashakon ke bare main bhi vichaar karen, jo rajeev gandhi ne apni jindagi se kho die
 My failure to filter out the pseudos present in this debate stems from my experiment
 hatyaron ko kisi bhi tarah kii raahat ko chennai kaa kanoonee or siyaasi prabhuvarg apni jeet bataata he
 On 30 August, when the death sentence was adjourned, slogans were raised in front of the same court and firecrackers were fired
 mukhyamantri jayalalita kii aguai main tamilnadu vidhansabha ne bhi ek prastaav paarit karke kaha ki mrityudand ko umr kaid main badal diya jaae
 This politics is absolutely transparent
 tamil kshetreey partiyon kii har saarvajanik bhangima rajeev gandhi kii hatya ko tarksangat tehraati he
 He is now being portrayed as a villain who did not allow the establishment of a Tamil state in Sri Lanka
 tamil chiton ke safaaye ne is gadhe hue bahaane kii jarurat or badha di he
 Why was Karunanidhi not so lenient towards these three murderers in 2000 when he refused to recommend amnesty to those when he was the chief minister? a decade later there is a big difference: politics
 karunanidhi ko lagata he ki ilam ke baad ke daur main tamil aakrosh ke aadhaar par vot bhunaane kii khaasi sambhaavna he
 The defeated leader lives in Firaq, looking for other pastures
 is maidan main jehar kii lapten hai, jo rashtriya hit ko chat kar jaatin or rajya kii ahm sansthaaon ko sankramit kar detii hai
 Is there anyone in the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly who is already Af
 jal guru ko kshamaa dilaane ke prastaav par kaam kar rahaa he?raajnneeti to loktantr kii jaan he
 It should not be allowed to become the death of national interest
 uttar pradesh kii rajdhani lakhanu main ek dilachasp vakya saamne aayaa he
 In a housing society here, the name of 'anarkali' handpump is on the tongue of everyone nowadays
 darasal ek handpump ko yahaan diwaar main chun diya gaya he, isiilie iskaa naam anaarakali handpump rakhaa gaya he
 The scene of the film mughal-e-azam is very famous in which the actress was chosen in the wall on the decree of Mughal emperor Akbar
 handpump kaa maamla isi se miltaa julata he
 a wall near the polytechnic intersection of Lucknow is attracting attention of the people in which this hand pump is selected
 yah diwaar awaas-vikaas board ke complex kii he
 Regarding the incident, a resident of here said to news agency ANI, 'this land is for housing development
 diwaar banaate vakt isamen handpump kii chunaai kar di gai
 Half of the hand pump is inside the wall while half is outside
 ise banaate vakt raaj mistriyon ne bhi gaur nahin kiya
 With the hand pump being selected, it is no longer useful
 log isse pani bhi nahin bhar sakate, isliye iskaa naam anaarakali handpump rakh diya
 This incident is similar to the film mughal-e-azam in which the heroine of the film was chosen in the wall on the orders of Mughal emperor Akbar
 handpump ke bare main kaha ja rahaa he ki yah diwaar ke raste main aa rahaa tha isliye chunaai karne vaale mazdooron ne ise hataane se acha banaae rakhane kaa faisla kiya or usee par diwaar khadi kar di

 31 (source: Indian Oil Corporation) haal hi main congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne bhaajapa main laalkrishna adwani ke kathith taur par apmaan ko mudda banaaya tha
 He had said in one of his speeches that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had kicked Advani off the stage with a shoe, which was discussed a lot
 is bich soshal media par viral ek video ke jariye yah dikhaane kii koshish ho rahi he ki bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne bhi laalkrishna adwani kii beijjati kii
 The caption of the video reads - "openly disrespectful! The ego's zenith is sending back its elderly leader who raised the party
" "video main do hisse hai, pehle hisse main ek photo main bhaajapa ke ek manch par modi, shah or adwani dikhaai de rahe hai
 In the photo, Amit Shah is seen pointing Advani backwards with a finger
 video ke duusare hisse main dikhaai de rahaa he ki pehle shah or adwani kuch baat karte hai phir shah adwani ko peeche jane kaa ishaara karte hai or adwani chale jate hai

 This video has been mischievously cut in the viral video, which can be deceiving seeing that Amit Shah is asking Advani to go back, but the story is different
 asli video main dekha ja saktaa he ki amit shah darasal adwani ko peeche bane manch kii taraf jane kaa ishaara kar rahe hai jahaan se unhen bhaashan dena tha
 It can be seen that Advani also goes on stage
 asli video main bhi netaaon kii aawaaj sunai nahin de rahi he, lekin dekhne se yah bhi lagata he ki pehle shah adwani se poochhate hai ki ve baith kar bolenge yaa manch par, jis par adwani bolte hai ki ve manch par jaakar bhaashan denge
 The video is of the bjp's national session held at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in Delhi in August 2014
 is kaarykram main bijepi ke kai diggaj netaa maujuud the
 In the video, Amit Shah is also seen touching the feet of Advani at one place
 bijepi main laalkrishna adwani kaa apmaan hone laga he yaa nahin ye bahes kaa vishay he, lekin kam-se-kam is video main adwani kii beijjati kaa daawa galat he

 Amit Shah, a senior Bharatiya Janata Party leader and a close aide of the party's prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi, has described Azamgarh as a hideout of terrorists
 unke is bayaan par uttar pradesh main sattarudh samaajawaadee party ne chunaav ayog se unke khilaaf karrwai kii maang kii he
 Addressing an election rally organized in support of party candidate Ramakant Yadav from Azamgarh Lok Sabha seat, Shah said, Azamgarh is the hideout of terrorists, because the SP government is lobbying to release them (arrested in terrorist cases)
 unhone kaha, upi main sarkaar kaa koi dar nahin he or gujarat bam visphot ke aaropee bhi azamgarh ke the, jinhen grahamantri rahete hue hamane giraftaar karavaaya or tab se aaj tak gujarat main koi aatanki ghatana nahin hui
 Reacting sharply to Shah's remarks, SP leader CP Rai said that the Election Commission should take appropriate action after taking cognizance of his remarks
 kashmir ke pulavama main 14 farvari ko siarpief ke kafile par hamale ke baad sarkaar yah dharna banane main kaamyaab rahi ki modi hi pakistan ko sabak sikhaa sakate hai
 After the airstrikes in Balakot, Pakistan, the party's research and public opinion polls found this belief strong
 surveykshan se yah bhi pataa chalaa ki pulavama main suraksha chook or balakot hamale ko lekar sawaal logon main zyada paith nahin bana paa rahe hai
 This belief changed the bjp's 2019 election theme
 party main sheersh str par research, surveykshanon or feedback ke aadhaar par kai daur ke prajentation hue, jiske baad tay kar liya gaya ki chunaav sirf modi brands par hi ladaa jayega
 Even BJP President Amit Shah issued instructions not to place his photo anywhere in the campaign material and campaign
 bhaajapa ne chunaav abhiyaan ranneeti ke teen sutara banaae
 One, weaken the anti-incumbency at the local level by eliminating the relevance of candidates
 duusare, prachaar kii 'timming' ekadam sateek ho, taaki votaron ko zyada sochane kaa samay na mili or abhiyaan main taazgi bani rahe
 Third, and most important, the electoral issue should be made only to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and nationalism so that no other face is seen
 isi ranneeti ke tahat pradhanmantri modi har chunavi sabha main kisi ummidavaar kaa naam lene kii bajaae camel kaa batan dabaane kii apil kar rahe hai or logon se kah rahe hai ki unka vot sidhe modi ko jayega
 The subparty taken from 2004, taking lessons from the 2004 feel good slogan, decided that nationalism and Modi's impeccable and honest image, apart from the working government, should be preferred in the campaign
 isi aadhaar par naare bhi gadhe gaye ki 'naammumkin ab mumkin he' or 'modi he to mumkin he
 'apart from this, the emphasis is on the working government
 puure prachaar kaa sandesh yahi he ki modi ne 5 saal main kachi neenv ko pakkaa kiya he or ab us par vikaas kii gaadi raftaar bharegi
 The BJP believes that if the party had only counted the works of development and claimed to have changed everything, the message of 'india Shining' would have been damaged as it was in 2004
 isliye party kaa naaraa he, kaam kiya he or kaam karenge
 Now 'justice' vs 'work stop, no country bowed', the BJP has made this change in response to Congress 'ab Hoga Nyaya' campaign
 bhaajapa ne apane chunavi agenda main nayaa naaraa taiyaar kiya he—kaam ruke naa, desh jhuke naa
 The BJP has cleverly linked nationalism with development
 iske liye party ne chunaav ghoshnaa-patr se 36 bindu chhante hai, jisamen bich kii raah apanaai gai he
 The party has prepared a new campaign by mentioning the schemes to be completed on time, in which the BJP will tell how Modi, who had not been for the poor for 70 years, has given momentum by coming to power
 masalan, 2022 tak sabko pakkaa makaan, 60,000 kimi nae rajmarg, aazaadee kii 75veen varshganth tak 75 nae medical college, 50 karod logon ko muft ilaaj, kisaanon ko 1 lakh ru
 Interest free loan etc
 main bhi chaukeedaar31 march ko piem ne talkatoraa stadium se deshbhar ke 'main bhi chaukeedaar' se jude walantirs ko sambodhit bhi kiya tha
 It is also important to know the story of the slogan 'main Bhi Chowkidar'
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi kii ore se 'chaukeedaar chor he' kenare par bhaajapa palatwaar nahin kar paa rahi thi
 Modi was hurt by this
 rahul ke aaropon par piem kii profeshnal team ne survey kiya or pataa lagaaya ki iskaa kya asar he
 It got feedback that there is resentment among the watchman and people are irritating with it
 is feedback ke baad piem modi ke oesady dow
 Hiren Joshi took command
 do din tak raat bhar piemo main kaam chalaa or 16 march ko 'main bhi chaukeedaar' campan launch hone tak kisi ko bhanak nahin lagi
 This campaign of Modi trended on the first position worldwide on the first day on social media and remained at number one in India for two consecutive days
 is tagaline ko 20 lakh logon ne hashtag se twit kiya
 1,680 crore Twitter impressions, more than 1 crore people watched videos and 1 crore people took the oath of 'main Bhi Chowkidar'
 sabhi bade party netaaon ne twitor handle par naam se pehle chaukeedaar shabd jod liya
 BJP is trying to make this election only Modi vote
 isliye prachaar ke har madhyam main sirf modi kii hi tasviir rakhi gai he
 Some of the publicity materials contained Shah's photo, but were later removed
 iske jariye bhaajapa kii koshish nirnaayak netritv ko or majboot dikhaane kii he
 Rajiv Chandrasekhar, member and MP of the campaign committee, says, "this is a pro-incumbency election for Modi and his government
" paanch saal main jo kaam hua he, us par pradhanmantri hi vot maang rahe hai
 Look at their intention, credibility and decide
 ek hi ranneeti he ki pradhanmantri sidhe hajaaron logon ke saath khud deal kar rahe hai
 Three levels of campaigning: The BJP has already made a change in the 2019 campaign by campaigning in 2014 before the election notification
 votaron ke dimag par chaa jane kii ranneeti ke tahat bhaajapa prachaar abhiyaan main 'timming' par khaasaa dhyaan de rahi he
 In this, the party has taken into consideration the 'theory of Dementia', so that the voter does not get enough time to forget
 prachaar main taazgi or sahi samay par votaron ke dimag main baat chadh jaae, iske liye party ne matdaan ke charnon ke hisaab se prachaar saamagree taiyaar kii he
 This time, bjp's campaign is being directly handled by national president Amit Shah and campaign committee chief Arun Jaitley
 timming kii theory shah ne hi di
 According to this, the BJP is putting digital, radio, television and outdoor hoardings-banners-posters in a jolt just 3-4 days before every phase of polling, so that Modi's mind is covered in the voters' minds
 isliye party ab 'modi he to mumkin he' jaise naare ko peeche kar 'phir ek baar modi sarkaar' par focus kar rahi he
 The Prime Minister himself sets the agenda through electoral rallies
 dilli ke ramlila maidan main 12 janvari ko diya unka sambodhan prachaar samiti ke liye blue print jaisaa tha
 The committee further worked on it
 iske alaava prachaar samiti ke pramukh arun jetali dilli main baithkar rojaanaa blog or press conference ke jariye agenda ko nai bahes main badalane kii koshish karte hai
 Apart from them, Rituraj Sinha, a professional youth member of the publicity committee, is working to spread the agenda through various means of campaigning across the country
 party ranneeti ke tahat congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ko lagaataar gher rahi he or iskaa jimmaa khud jetali sambhaal rahe hai
 This time the BJP has relied on its team instead of Prashant Kishore or any other professional agency
 shah or jetali ne hi mukhya naare ko antim rup diya
 Among the 8 members of the campaign committee, Union Minister Piyush Goyal, National General Secretary Anil Jain and Rituraj Sinha are leading the campaign in a professional manner
 sinha ko party ne mukhyalay main duusari manzil par bada-sa daftar diya he, jisamen unki apni 50 se adhik logon kii profeshnal team 24 ghante kaam kar rahi he
 The role of state minister Sinha in Bihar BJP is similar to Ajay Singh (now owner of spicejet), who was an associate of Pramod Mahajan during the 2004 campaign
 monitering bhi chaukasaparty mukhyalay main ruturaj sinha ke saath digital team kaam kar rahi he, jo desh bhar main chal rahe 400 se zyada rathon par dikhaai ja rahi 18-19 minute kii film, lokation samet har pal kii report le rahi he
 Apart from this, the team is also directly monitoring the location and number of outdoor hoardings-banners
 rojaanaa rathon or nukkad naatakon ke madhyam se 5,000 se zyada sabhaayen ho rahi hai
 The BJP has focused the campaign on 10 years of UPA versus 5 years of Modi
 ranneeti ke mutabik, rahul gandhi ko har mudde par expoj karne or unhen jhootha sabit karne ke liye jetali sareekhe netaaon ke sidhe saamne aane kii ranneeti banaai gai he
 According to Chandrasekhar, 'this time the election campaign has been done not for the party but for the general public
 main bhi chaukeedaar andolan usee kaa hissaa he
 Compared to 2014, it has become a campaign of civic campaigning 'the party believes that in 65 years, the notion that the poor will always be poor and will become richer and richer, Modi has changed that thinking
 ramlila maidan main janvari main hue adhiveshan main bhaajapa ne 'abaki baar phir modi sarkaar' ko mukhya theme banaaya tha, lekin party ke kai ranneetikaron ko isamen 2014 ke 'achche din aane vaale hai' jaisi apil nahin dikh rahi thi
 Therefore, in the publicity committee meetings, slogans like 'once again Modi government' and 'once again Modi government' and 'this time Modi government' were suggested, but finally when Shah and Jaitley sat down to decide on it, it was decided That once again Modi government should be made the main slogan
 pulavama se pehle tak bhaajapa puri tarah se vikaas ke agenda par 22 karod labhaarthi or apane 9 karod veryphid praathmik sadasyon par aadhaarit ranneeti bana rahi thi
 In 2014, BJP received 17 crore votes
 aise main bhaajapa ko ummid thi ki vikaas ke agenda par bhi agar sabhi labhaarthi party ko vot nahin karte hai to bhi bhaajapa kaa pradarshan 2014 ke mukaable behatar ho saktaa he
 The BJP was promoting nationalism in the name of Modi, which started during the JNU scandal
 jeenyu cond ne bhaajapa ko mauka diya or usne badi chaturaai se rashtrawaad ko payalat project ke taur par aage badhaayaa
 Modi has said in election meetings that this election is between nationalism and familism
 kendriya mantri ravishankar prasad kehete hai, ''hamen garv he ki rashtrawaad, rashtriya suraksha or rashtriya swabhimaan is chunaav ke bade mudde bane hai
 "it will be interesting to see whether the 2019 election increases or rejects the acceptance of the brand Modi

 swati ne kaha, 'maine film chhod di he
 At first i was not sure, i had two things on my mind but a few days ago i had a meeting with my team and i decided to leave the film because i feel that it will not be right to play this role at this point in my career
 'bataa den pichley maheene hi swati ne is bare main bataaya tha ki film main un par filmaae gaye seens ko rishut karne kii baat kahi gai thi

 in / khandaani shafakhana main kaam karne se pehle aapako apane kariyar ko lekar dar nahin laga?jab mujhe film kii van line story sunai gai thi to meri pehali pratikriya yahi thi ki mere paas yah film lekar kyon aae hai
 But when i read the script, i decided to do this film
 kyonki iskaa vishay bahut hi dilachasp or bold he
 The interesting thing is that even today, people hesitate to talk on such a topic
 gharavaalon ne aisi film karne se roka nahin?meri mom ne bhi kaha tha ki tum kaise yah film kar sakati ho? magar jab unhone puri script padhi to mujhe yah film karne kii ijaajat de di
 If they were not allowed, i might not have done this film
 mom se ijaajat lene kaa matlab?main bhi aam bhartiya ladakiyon main se ek hum
 Even today i do not talk to my parents on sex
 bachapan se hamaari parvarish hi aisi hui he
 People believe that sex means dirty talk
 aap bhi maanati hai ki sex gandi baat he?nahin
 i am in this world today because of whom
 usee topic kii vajah se
 Then how did this topic become dirty
 film yah bataati he ki sex ganda nahin he
 How helpful will this film be in changing the mindset of people about sex? Before this film, films like 'vicky Donor', 'shubh Mangal Savdhan' and 'badhaai Ho' have appeared and have been accepted by the audience
 mujhe lagata he ki khandaani shafakhana ko dekhakar log thode jaagruk honge
 Because it is shown in the film that the doctor who cures the secret diseases can not only be a male but also a girl can run a sex clinic ie a girl can also become a sex guru
 film kii mahila nirdeshak hone se acting main aap zyada sahaj thim?bilkul
 During the shooting of the film, Shilpi Dasgupta was my elder sister more and director was less
 agar koi purush nirdeshak hota to shaayad main asahaj ho jaati
 Is it easier to talk about sex with comedy? Comedy truth is an easy way to share secret knowledge
 yah film bacchon or parivaar ke saath dekhne vaali he
 Seeing this, there will be no shame
 sex shiksha to kai rajyon main bain he
 What would you say? This is wrong
 meraa maananaa he ki bachapan se hi sex shiksha diya janaa chahie
 This will prevent children from going on the wrong path
 kalank kii asafalataa ko aap apane kariyar main kis tarah se dekhati hai?kalank main maine apane kirdaar ke saath nyaay kiya or darshakon ne mere kaam kii vaahvahee kii
 i consider it good for my career
 jahaan tak kalank kii asafalataa kii baat he to darshakon ko pasand nahin ai to nahin ai
 Success and failure will remain in the careers of films and actors
 lekin actor ke taur ham sakaaratmak rup se aage dekhte hai
 Due to the recent films with some controversy, it is believed that our cinema is not responsible for society? i do not agree with this
 cinema samaaj kaa aainaa he
 Everything that happens in society is seen in cinema
 cinema manoranjan karne vaala madhyam he or har tarah kii filmon se darshakon ko manoranjan ho rahaa he

 vaise to yahaan lok sabha kii sirf saat siten hai
 But the results of the assembly elections here in December last year caught the attention of the whole country
 pandrah saal se satta main kabiz congress kaa puri tarah se safaya ho gaya
 BJP emerged as the largest party but could not form the government
 bhrashtachar virdohi andolan kii kokh se janmi aam aadmi party ne shandaar pradarshan kiya
 Won 28 seats and ran the government for 49 days with the support of Congress
 khub surkhiyaan batorin
 The way the government came from
 ab puure desh main apane ummidavaar khadey kar aam aadmi party congress or bijepi donon ko chunauti dene kii koshish kar rahi he
 But the biggest question is that why did the new-fledged Aam Aadmi Party get the benefit of anti-congress wave in a city like Delhi instead of BJP? And will this trend continue in the Lok Sabha elections also? BJP leaders themselves, despite claiming a wave of Modi, are not expecting to win all the seven seats
 party ke andruni survey main bhi sirf chaar siton par hi bijepi kii jeet kii sambhaavna jataai ja rahi he
 At the same time, the bjp's anti-bjp parties consider it a contest on only two seats
 ye tab he jab dilli ke akhbaar, tivi channel, radio or sadaken narendra modi ke vigyapanon se pate pade hai
 In contrast, in the 2009 elections, the Congress captured all the seven seats in Delhi
 ise aarthik sankat se ubaarane ke liye pradhanmantri manmohan singh ke prati madhya varg ke samarthan ke rup main dekha gaya tha
 The trio of Madan Lal Khurana, Vijay Kumar Malhotra and Kedarnath Sahni in Delhi was the backbone of the Jana Sangh and later the BJP
 inkaa yug samaapt hone ke baad party ne dilli main vaikalpik netritv taiyaar karne main bahut deree kii
 The ongoing tussle in the party at the central level reached the maximum at the state level in Delhi
 or yahaan bhi party usee beemaari kaa shikaar ho gai
 Despite the favorable atmosphere in the Delhi Assembly elections, the BJP was reduced from forming the government with only four seats
 iske peeche ek badi vajah harshavardhan or vijay goyal ke bich chalaa takaraav mana gaya
 Now Vijay Goyal has been removed from the politics of Delhi by making him an MP of Rajya Sabha from Rajasthan
 harshavardhan dilli main bijepi ke sarvesarva bana die gaye hai
 The party has given this message that the command of the party will remain with them in the state for the next ten years
 phir bhi bijepi dilli main saaton siten jeet paane kaa daawa kyon nahin kar paa rahi he? sabase badi vajah he ummidavaaron kaa chunaav
 Barring Harshvardhan, no major BJP leader bothered to contest from Delhi
 harshavardhan, ramesh vidhudi, parvesh verma or minakshi lekhi ko chhod baaki teen ummidavaar baahar se laae gaye hai
 Bhojpuri films actor Manoj Tiwari, who was once a candidate of the Samajwadi Party, has been roped in to woo the votes of Purvanchalis
 vahiin shri shri ravishankar ke cote se mahesh giri ko tikat diya gaya he
 Dalit leader and recently joined BJP, Uditraj is also BJP candidate
 bijepi ke ranneetikaar daawa karte hai ki dilli ke log sidhe modi ke naam par vot denge, unke liye ummidavaar mahatv nahin rakhata
 But the interesting thing is that this claim was also made in the Delhi Assembly elections
 jiskaa nateeja sabake saamne he
 At that time the Congress was on the slope, but now the way the crowd gathered in a meeting of Rahul Gandhi, it seems that the angry voters from the Congress have left the Aam Aadmi Party and started coming with the Congress
 jin modi ke naam par bijepi dilli main chunaav lard rahi he unki sirf ek hi sabha karvaa saki
 Subsequent election meetings were canceled because Modi had planned to hold 3D meetings in Delhi
 lekin aakhri vakt par satellite main ai dikkat kii vajah se ye 3di sabhaayen bhi nahin ho sakin
 Punjab Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Badal had to have meetings to woo Sikh voters, that could not happen
 in sab dikkaton ke baavjood bijepi kii ummiden abhi khatm nahin hui hai
 Some BJP leaders say they have faith in the public that wants to see Narendra Modi as Prime Minister
 ye kehete hai ki vidhansabha chunaav main aise kai log the jinhone mukhyamantri ke liye chaahe arvind kejariwal ko vot diya ho, lekin lok sabha main wo modi ke liye vot karnaa chaahate the
 Whether it really happens or not, it will be known only on 16 May
 chhattisgarh ke rajim main pakhwaade bhar chalane vaala kumbh shuru ho gaya he
 Devotees and tourists from the country and abroad are reaching Rajim city to join this Kumbh
 peri, sondhur or mahanadi ke sangam par sthit rajim ko madhya-bharat kaa prayag bhi kaha jaataa he
 Rajim Kumbh, popularly known as the fifth Kumbh of the country, has given special recognition to Chhattisgarh in the country and abroad
 rajim kumbh main desh bhar se aae akhaadon ke mahant or saadhuon ke darshan or punya snaan ke liye har saal badi sankhya main shraddhalu pahunchate hai
 The discourse Pandit Ajay Sharma says that just as Banaras rests on the tip of the trident located inside the sea, like the city of Dwarka on the conch, the Rajim city is located on the lotus in the middle of the five Kosi lake
 prayag kii tarah teen nadiyon ke sangam par sthit hone ke kaaran rajim ko snaan, daan or shraadh ke liye banaras ke saamaan pavitra mana jaataa he
 Rajim has a temple of Kuleshwar Mahadev in the middle of the river, which is the center of faith of Shiva devotees across the country
 kshetra ke prakandi bramhan dhusu dewan bataate hai ki puranic manyata ke anusaar dharti ko mrityulok main sthapit karne ke baad brahma ji behad chintit the ki dharti or isamen rahane vaale logon kii asuron se raksha kaise kii jaae
 All the gods reached Brahma to solve this problem
 par kisi ko kuch samaj main nahin aa rahaa tha
 After this, everyone remembered God and a five-cursed, fragrant, dripping lotus flower appeared in front of him
 uske chaaron taraf saikadon bhanvare jhume rahe the
 Brahma was very happy to see Kamal
 unhone camel ko kaha ki 'he padam, tum dharti par jahaan giroge vahiin ishwar kaa vaas hoga or us sthaan par manushyon ke sabhi kashton kaa ant hoga
 After this, the lotus moved towards the earth and from where it fell, it spread over an area of five Kos
 us paanch kos bhukhand ke swami rajeev lochan hai
 On the five petals of the lotus, there are five ground-backs which are called Panch Koshi Dham
 isiilie kaha jaataa he ki yah nagari padam yani camel ke phool par sthapit he or bhagwaan rajeevalochan par camel chadhaane kaa rivaaj he, jiske chalate rajim ko padmavati puri bhi kaha jaataa he
 Salvation is attained in Rajim, just like Gaya, Prayag and Banaras
 shrimad rajeevalochan mahatmaya ke anusaar rajim baikunth ke saamaan pavitra he or kaashi main nivas karne vaale sabhi devataaon kaa yahaan bhi nivas he
 Villagers nearby believe that bathing in the Padma Sarovar in Rajim removes all the sufferings of life and if there is any disease in the body, it also goes away
 kaha jaataa he ki varshon pehle samant viraval jaipal yahaan ke raja the, unhen bhagwaan vishnu ne sapane main darshan dekar kaha ki vah chaahate hai ki mahanadi ke kinare unka ek mandir banwaaya jaae
 The king got the temple built, but he had a problem where to bring the statue of God
 is bich kshetra main rahane vaali rajim naam kii ek taili mahila ko bhagwaan vishnu kii aadhi murti mili
 The king went to him and said that he wanted to install the statue he found in the temple
 is par mahila ne shart rakhi ki vah murti tabhi degi jab uskaa naam bhagwaan ke naam ke saath joda jayega
 The eyes of the idol (lochan) were very beautiful due to which the name of the temple was 'rajimalochan' and the name of the area was Rajim
 rajimalochan ko ab rajeevalochan kaha jaataa he par gramin abhi bhi ise iske puraane naam se hi jaanate hai

 The Delhi government has given a big cheat to people living in unauthorized colonies
 jin 895 coloniyon ko pichley saal sitambar main niyamit karne kaa elaan kiya gaya wo vaaki niyamit hue hi nahin hai
 That is because the rules that have to be fulfilled to regularize these colonies are not yet fulfilled
 ye sansanikhez khulaasa dilli sarkaar ke sachiv kii ek chitti se hua he jo unhone centre sarkaar ko likhi he
 Those who rule the capital of the country have again brought the people living in these colonies into the limelight
 kareeb aath maheene pehle yani pichley saal 4 sitambar ko inamen se 895 coloniyon ko niyamit karne kaa aadesh dilli sarkaar ke shahari vikaas vibhaag ne nikaala
 But the biggest officer of the same department has written a letter to the central government on April 30, saying that there has been a glitch in at least 5 rules in regularizing these colonies, in which the central government should now give relief
 sarkaar bhi maanati he ki kamiyaan rah gayi hai
 The surprising thing is that the letter sent by the Delhi government to the Center has sought exemption to the conditions of seeking any documents other than the maps of the colony, certificates of merit, from the 895 colonies which have been regularized
 Give the authority of the Center to the Delhi government
 iske alaava niyamitikaran kii us ahm shart main bhi chhot maangi gai he jiske mutabik colony ke kam se kam 10 fisadi hisse par 31 march 2002 ke nakshe ke hisaab se nirmaan hona chahie
 In many of the regularized colonies, the same land is considered part of two different colonies, now the Delhi government is going to talk about changing their rules
 yani dilli sarkaar ne aankh moond kar coloniyon ko niyamit karne kaa faisla liya, jo ki ab bhi niyam banane waalon ko bhi dhokhaa lag rahaa he
 The extent is that it has come eight months after the government issued an order to regularize the recall of these mistakes
 yani shaq kii sooyee is par bhi jaati he ki ye sab mahaj ek galati he yaa phir khalis dhokhaa, kyonki ab tak sitambar main niyamit hone vaali coloniyon kii list kaa gajet notification bhi nahin hua he

 angreji main apni bilkul nai or aashcharyachakit karne vaali style main ram katha likhane vaale amish treepathi ne ravan kii kahani ko jis tarah se likhaa he, vah ek nai vyakhya pesh karata he
 Rather it should be said that in his new novel Ravan: Enemy of Aryavarta, the story of Ravana is presented in such a way that you will be shocked
 kya aap soch sakate hai ki vibhishana or shurpanakha ravan ke sage nahin balki sautele bhai-bahan the? kya aapaki kalpana kii udaan bumadhyasaagar tak pahunch sakati he kyonki amish ne vibhishana or shurpanakha ko greek rajkumaari ke betaa-beti ke rup main darshaya he? kya ravan kaa sagaa bhai sirf or sirf kumbhakarna hi tha? kya ravan kaa bhai kumbhakarna behad tejatarraar, chatur or vyavasik buddhi kaa tha? or kya usne ravan ke kaarobaari samrajya ko africa deshon tak pahunchaaya tha? agar aap in sawaalon par chaunk rahe hon to chaunkiye nahin balki inkaa uttar haa main sunne ke liye amish ke is nae upanyaas Ravan: Enemy of Aryavarta ko padhiye
 Generally, the whole story of Ravana begins and ends in his gold Lanka
 zyada se zyada mithila main sita ke swayamvar main janaa or pashchimi uttar pradesh ke paas kahin uski janmabhumi hona usko bhugolic vistaar detaa he
 His struggle of his empire in South India also looks bleak
 lekin amish ne dashanan ravan ko das siron vaale khalanaayak kii jagah ek aise shaks ke rup main dikhaaya he, jisamen jitani bauddhik or yauddhik kshamta he, usase kahin zyada kutilata, ghrinaa or nimna str par utraa hua ghinauna pratikriyavaad bhi, ravan ko khalanaayak dikhaate hue bhi upanyaaskaar ne usko paristhitiyon kaa maaraa hua ek aisa kirdaar dikhaaya he jo bachapan main apane saath hui jyadatiyon ko bade hone par duusare par utaarata he,ravan kii aam taur par chhavi ek bade yoddha or shaasha kii banati he lekin amish ne uski ek chhavi ek shaatir or dhoort vyapaaree ke rup main bhi pesh kii he, ravan kii kahani ko unhone ek anaath bachche kii adamya ichha shakti ke rup main dikhaaya he, jisamen vah apane bal par apane pita ke ashram se nikalataa he or vaidyanath dham se hote hue odisha pahunchataa he or vahaan se samudr ke raste lanka tak pahunchataa he
 Her villainy is challenged by her mother, but how Ravana's dominance makes her undisciplined and unsympathetic is shown in the novel very closely
 or haa, ravan kaa ek or swaroop bhi khulkar aata he ki kya vah sangeet kaa behad marmajna tha?ram chandra siries main amish kaa yah teesraa upanyaas he
 He has previously written novels such as Ram: Scion of Ikshvaku and Sita: Warrior of Mithila
 agar aapane pehle ke donon upanyaas padhe honge to aap dekhenge ki kaise teenon upanyaason kaa taana-bana ek duusare se buna hua he
 But if you want to read this novel under the shadow of religious sentimentality and rationality about religion, then you have to be disappointed
 aap isko ek aise upanyaas ke rup main padhie jo ravan ke vyaktitv ko nae daur se jodakar pesh karata he
 The special thing is that this novel is now available in English as well as Hindi

 gat dinon corbett park ke platinum jubilee samaaroh main shaamil hue uttarakhand ke mukhyamantri bhuwan chandra khanduri baaghon kii suraksha par chaahe jitani chintaa vyakt karen yaa unki suraksha ke liye gambhir kadam uthaane kaa daawa karen, lekin sach yah he ki baaghon par sankat badhata hi ja rahaa he
 Project Tiger was started in Corbett Park after the Wildlife Protection Act was enacted in 1972
 yojana is kadar saf l rahi ki vartmaan main corbett park main baaghon kii sankhya 150 se adhik ho gai he, jabaki park kebaahari van kshetron ko mila diya jaae to baaghon kii sankhya 260 ke lagbhag bataai jaati he
 While the density of tigers in the country is 12-13 tigers per 100 km, in Uttarakhand, this number is 20 tigers per 100 km
 lekin baaghon kii sankhya badhane ke saath ab sangrakshan se judi pareshaaniyaan bhi badhane lagi hai
 The ongoing Tiger Project for the conservation of tigers in Rajaji National Park is not beneficial for all tigers in the region due to its limitations
 neshnal park main rahane vaale baagh shikariyon se bhi surakshit batch sakate hai or yahaan maanav-vanyajeev sangharsh kii sambhaavna bhi kam he, lekin jo 100 se adhik baagh corbett kii seemaa ke baahar kevan kshetra main rahete hai
 From their safety to the environment, there is a serious threat
 is kshetra main vanyajeev taskaron kaa aantak bhi bad gaya he
 Due to the deployment of security personnel in the inner area of the park, wildlife smugglers are not able to easily target tigers, but there are no security personnel in the outer areas
 isiilie ab rajya ke vanyajeev premi project tiger ke vistaar kii maang kar rahe hai, lekin shart yah he ki yah vistaar vyaavhaarik or janapaksheeya ho
 Anil Baluni, vice-chairman of the Uttarakhand Forest and Environment Advisory Council, says the central government should decide whether to save the tiger or run Project Tiger
 uttarakhand main lagbhag 260 baaghon ke paae jane kii pushti hui he, jisamen se aadhe hi is project ke tahat cover ho paa rahe hai
 Besides Corbett, there are tigers in Terai Central and Terai Eastern Forest Division, Haldwani Forest Division, Western Ramnagar Forest Division as well as Kotdwar and Lansdowne Forest Division and their numbers are increasing there
 paryaavaran salaahkaar parishad ne is project ko adhik vyaavhaarik banane ke liye sarkaar ke saath hi rashtriya baagh praadhikaran ke sadsy sachiv dow
 Has also written a letter to Rajesh Gopal
 16 aktubar ko police ne tanakpur kenikat ek baghin ke shikaar ke maamle main panipat ketotaraam baavariyaa giroh ke chah sadasyon ko giraftaar kiya tha
 Uttarakhand head of the Wildlife Protection Society, Rajendra Aggarwal, says that when the project cost Rs 2,000 crore
 centre sarkaar kharch kar hi rahi he, tab ise thodaa or vyaavhaarik banane main kya dikkat he
 The tigers are neither to the border of Corbett Park nor to Project Tiger
 ve to vahaan jaaenge, jahaan unhen bhojan milegaa
 That is why the tiger has to be saved where it is
 pichley 40 varshon se corbett park ke maanad vanyajeev pratipaalak kunwar vijendra singh kehete hai ki project tiger ke tahat lansdowne van prabhag or rajaji neshnal park kaa kuch kshetra milakar ek baagh coridor banaaya janaa chahie
 Due to the rapid increase in the number of tigers in the state, tiger and human collision is expected to intensify in the coming times
 unka kahana he ki lagaataar badhati sankhya ke kaaran ve park kebaahari kshetron kii ore nikal rahe hai, lekin sarkaar kaa is ore koi dhyaan nahin he
 The seriousness of the Uttarakhand government regarding the protection of wildlife and tigers is evident from the fact that under Operation Lord, 700 daily wage employees engaged in protection of wildlife were not paid for eight months
 yah vetan unhen mukhyamantri ke ramnagar daure se do din pehle hangaame kii ashanka se bachane ke liye diya gaya, jabaki centre sarkaar vetan agast maah main hi jari kar chuki thi
 Corbett Tiger Reserve Deputy Director c
 ke
 Dayal says that a big problem lies with more than 400 families within the park
 unkedvara kiye ja rahe nirmaan vanyajiwan keliye pareshaani paidaa kar rahe hai
 Most of the incidents of tiger and human conflict have also taken place in the Sunderkhal area within the park last year
 sarkaar in pariwaron ke visthaapan kii baat to kar rahi he, lekin abhi tak yah sambhav nahin ho paaya he
 After the launch of Project Tiger, the whole world has been attracted to Kesailani Corbett, which has benefited the hotel owners here, but the local community has become troublesome
 yahaan log or maveshi donon baaghon kaa niwala ban rahe hai
 The situation is that from April 2009 to April 2011 the tiger carried out more than 25 attacks on humans and 11 tigers were killed during this period
 corbett kii platinum jubilee ke bahaane duniya bhar ke baagh visheshgy yahaan manthan kar ja chuke hai, lekin baaghon ke sawaal par koi sakaaratmak pahal ab tak saamne nahin ai he

 lekin chunaav ayog ne raajnneetik partiyon ko milane vaale benami nakad chande par nakel kasne ke liye siforishein kya kin, maano sabhi partiyon ko jaise saanp soongh gaya
 Most parties considered it good to refrain from commenting on the recommendations of the Election Commission
 unka kahana he ki sarkaar kii jimmedaari he ki tamaam partiyon ko vishwaas main lekar is mudde par sansad main charchaa karaae, uske baad samvidhan main sanshodhan kaa faisla ho
 The Election Commission has recommended allowing political parties to donate less than Rs 2000
 chunaav ayog ne chunaav main kaale dhan ke istemaal par roak lagane kii koshish ke tahat sarkaar se kanoonon main sanshodhan kii jarurat jataai he
 The Election Commission is trying to ban secret funds given to political parties at the cost of Rs 2,000 or above
 abhi tak raajnneetik dalon ke gupt chanda lene par koi sanvaidhanik yaa vaidhanik pratibandh nahin he
 But under Section 29C of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, there is an 'indirect partial ban' on the Gupta Chandas, necessitating the declaration of the donations
 lekin ye baat sirf 20,000 rupye se upar ke gupt chandon par hi lagu hoti he
 That is, till now, political parties were exempted from taking the name, address and other information of the secret donors below 20 thousand rupees
 lekin ab ayog kii sifarish he ki sarkaar ko is maamle main or zyada paardarshita laane ke liye seemaa ko 20 hajaar se ghataakar do hajaar kar dena chahie
 The Commission also says that the right to cancel registration of parties not contesting elections should also be given to the Commission
 philhal, is bady sifarish par khaskar vipakshi dal kuch bhi sidhi pratikriya dene se batch rahe hai
 The matter has been recommended by the Commission, so instead of saying anything on this, they considered it better to advise the government
 congress ke varisht netaa or koshadhyaksh motilal vora ne ise sarkaar kaa visheshadhikaar bataate hue kaha ki chunaav ayog kii siforeeshon par kaise amal karnaa he, ye sarkaar tay kare
 Vora also said that it is necessary to consult all parties in Parliament in this whole process
 vora ne mana ki kuch raajnneetik dal chande ke hisaab main gadabad karte hai
 According to Vora, the Congress always gives details of its income and expenditure to the Income Tax Department
 duusari ore, jediu ke netaa pawan verma ne bhi chunaav ayog kii siforeeshon kaa swaagat kiya he
 Verma has also told the government to take steps to implement these recommendations
 haalanki ab tak bahut kam avasar aise aae hai jab chunaav ayog or phir us par vidhi ayog kii siforeeshon par sansad main gambhirtha se charchaa hokar un siforeeshon ko lagu karne ke liye kanoonee praavdhaanon main sanshodhan kiya gaya ho
 Most of the recommendations do not come out of the huge files of reports
 congress koshadhyaksh vora ke mutabik chunaav ayog kii siforeeshon ko centre kii ore se amuman gambhirtha se hi liya jaataa he
 Regarding the procedure in this case, Vora said that the recommendations are laid on the floor of the Parliament
 chunaav ayog kii siforishein kanoon mantralay ko jaati hai
 The Law Ministry sends it to the Law Commission, then the Law Commission examines its legal viability and sends it to the government with its comments
 ye to hui prakriya lekin sachai ye he ki ikkaa dukka maukey hi aaye hai jab raajnneetik partiyon ne apni suvidha ke mutabik janpratinidhitiv kanoon main sanshodhan kiye hai wo bhi apane raajnneetik napha nuksaan dekhte hue
 However, the Commission has made several recommendations in the past to prevent the use of black money in elections, ban muscle power, disqualify candidates with criminal records from contesting elections and make strict provisions on violating the code of conduct
 ye alag baat he ki adhiktar siforishein sirf report kaa hissaa ban kar padi hai, yani amal nahin hua
 Former Chief Election Commissioner SY Qureshi says that this campaign started only when he was appointed Election Commissioner
 kuraishi ke mutabik apane kaarykaal main unhone na keval ise aage badhaayaa balki majboot bhi kiya

 The government on Saturday dismissed BJP leader Yashwant Sinha's allegations that his and his family's phones were being tapped and said their allegation was 'completely false'
 kendriya grih sachiv aar
 K
 singh ne kaha, ‘hamane sinha or unke parivaar ke sadasyon ke phone ko kabhi tap nahin kiya
 This is completely wrong
 ’unhone kaha, ‘sinha or unke parivaar ke sadasyon ke telephonon ko tap karne kaa sawaal hi paidaa nahin hota
 No such proposal came to me
 ’ kisi bhi vyakti ke phone tap karne ke liye kendriya grih sachiv kii anumati kii jarurat hoti he
 He issues an order to tap the telephone at the request of security agencies
 sinha ne shuukravaar ko ranchi main aarope lagaaya tha ki tatkaaleen grih mantri pi chidambaram ke khilaaf airsel mexis kaa mudda uthaane ke baad unke or unke parivaar waalon ke phone ko tap kiya gaya
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has already prepared for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 piem modi 20 disambar se lekar 3 janvari tak bijepi ke sabhi saansadon se alag-alag group main mulaakaat karenge
 It is believed that apart from the current issues, this meeting is also an attempt to find the pulse of the public through ground report
 mana ja rahaa ki teen rajyon main satta jane ke baad piem modi ne ground report ke saath saansadon ko bulaayaa he
 Meeting of mps from Haryana, Himachal and JK on 20 December The Prime Minister will first meet mps from Delhi, Chandigarh, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab and Uttarakhand from 8 pm to 10 pm on 20 December
 iske baad 26 disambar ko shaam 6 se 8 baje tak pashchimi uttar pradesh, 8 se 10 baje tak madhya uttar pradesh ke saansadon se mulaakaat karenge
 On December 27, PM Modi will meet mps of UP Bihar separately from 6 to 8 PM in eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar
 28 disambar ko shaam 6 se 8 tak madhya pradesh or chhattisgarh, raat 8 se 10 baje tak andhra pradesh, telugana, karnataka, tamilnadu, kerala, puducheri or lakshadweep ke saansadon se piem modi milenge

 On the same day, PM Modi will meet mps from Andaman and Nicobar, Jharkhand, Odisha, North East and West Bengal from 8 to 10 pm
 alag-alag group main saansadon se milengepm modi ne pehali baar is tarah se alag-alag group main bijepi ke saansadon se mulaakaat karenge
 It is believed that during this meeting, PM Modi mps will not only take details of their works, but will also collect information about where the party stands in the ground report
 teen rajyon main satta jane se bijepi gahan chintan-manthan ke daur se guzar rahi he
 Preparation for 2019: The way PM Modi has selected the group to meet the mps, it is clear that his exercise is in view of the elections in 2019
 piem modi ne jahaan pashchimi or madhya uttar pradesh ko ek din to duusare din purvi uttar pradesh or bihar ke saansadon ko mulaakaat ke liye bulaayaa he
 In such a situation, it is clear that this meeting is very important for mps
 upachunaav ke nateezon main itani utsukata shaayad hi pehle kabhi rahi ho, lekin is baar baat hi kuch or he
 It has been less than 100 days to the Modi government, and 10 days have elapsed since the Red Fort gave a speech, so everyone's eyes were on this by-election
 ab jaraa silsilewar dhang se dekhte hai
 Elections were held on 10 seats in Bihar
 isi saal may main hue loksabhaa chunaav ke aankadon ko dekhen to isamen se aath siton par bijepi-algepi gathbandhan aage tha, jabaki do siton par congress
 After the results, or within 100 days of the Lok Sabha elections, the BJP alliance has only four seats and lalu-nitish and Congress have six seats
 bijepi ne do siten congress se chhini hai
 The Congress was ahead in the Lok Sabha elections on the seats of Narkatiaganj and Mohania, but both lost this time
 yani, congress ko itaraane kii jarurat nahin he
 Poor candidate selection and falling credibility are still the problems of the Congress
 bhale hi congress ne bijepi se bhagalpur kii seat jiti he, kyonki bijepi bhagalpur kii loksabhaa seat bhi haar chuki he
 In Chhapra, bjp's candidate is third, and there is an independent candidate in second place, while in Hajipur, an independent Dev Kumar Chaurasia made bjp's victory easy by bringing 15,000 votes
 yahaan bijepi kii jeet kaa antar 10,000 voton kaa he
 But JDU, the seat of Parbatta, surprised everyone by winning by a margin of 40,000 votes
 vahiin, baankaa kii seat bijepi ne hajaar voton ke antar se jiti
 What does it mean politically? Whether to pass lalu-nitish or not
 fori taur par is nattejey main lalu-nitish ke saath-saath narendra modi kii bhi jeet he
 Where Modi's face was not in front of the public, the BJP was seen gasping
 or to or, karnataka main bijepi bellari kaa garh haar gai or yediurppa kii seat par unke bete kii jeet kaa antar bhi kam ho gaya
 That is, in the political situation that has now become the BJP, Modi is the medicine for every merge
 or ab desh kii raajnneeti main bhi ek dhruvikaran dekhne ko mil saktaa he
 If Lalu and Nitish can unite to save their existence, many forces will now look after Mulayam and Mayawati to gather them
 abhi uttar pradesh main chunaav hone main vakt he, or tab tak raajnneeti main kuch bhi ho saktaa he
 Everything will depend on whether Sonia Gandhi wants to play the role of some sort of narrator in Uttar Pradesh or not
 is upachunaav kii ek sikh punjab se bhi he
 Here the Congress has won the seat of Patiala and the seat of Talwandi Sabo is for the Akalis, but the lesson is for Arvind Kejriwal, because Aam Aadmi Party's Dharamvir Gandhi is an MP from Patiala and his party's Assembly candidate has not even saved his bail
 
 loksabhaa chunaav 2014 main punjab se aam aadmi party ke chaar saansad jite the, or ab 100 din ke bheetar vidhansabha upachunaav main jamaanat bachaani bhi mushkil ho gai
 These are the results of the by-election, but do not ignore its meaning
 raajnneeti main, har chunaav main janata kuch sandesh detii he, or zarurat he use samajhane kii
 Like, it would be wrong to say that the upper castes of Bihar are with the BJP, because if it were true, Ramanand Prasad Singh of JDU, Rishi Mishra from Jale, Randhir Kumar Singh from Chapra and Ajit Sharma from Congress would not have won
 bharat chodo andolan kii 77veen varshganth par uttar pradesh ke prayagraj ke parade maidan main paudharopan kaa mahakumbh kaa aayojan kiya gaya
 More than 66 thousand plants were distributed to the people in this event

 He said, 'counting trees hundred years old or older in the state should be preserved as heritage
 iske liye van vibhaag ek smarika prakashit karen
 Such trees will be declared as heritage trees
 'yogi ne kaha, 'deshi aam ke ped ab nahin kaate jaaenge
 If there is a forest, there is water
 prayagraj ke mahatv ko banaae rakhane ke liye bhi van taiyaar hon
 He also said, "prayagraj has proved how the world's big events can happen
 isiilie vriksh kumbh ke liye prayagraj ko chunaa gaya

 'on Friday, more than 66 thousand saplings were distributed among the people at the parade ground of Prayagraj
 yah ab tak sarvaadhik paudhe baantne kaa vishwa ricard he

 iske liye kaarykram sthal par maujuud ginis book of world ricard ke pratinidhi swapnil dangrekar ne ise darj kar liya he
 On this occasion, he gave a certificate to Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath
 hajaaron kii bheed ke saath hi upmukhya mantri keshav prasad maury, phulpur kii saansad keshari devi patel, elahabaad sansadeey seat kii saansad doctor reeta bahuguna joshi, kaushambi saansad vinod sonkar, meyar abhilaashaa gupta nandi ne iskaa swaagat kiya
 Feel terrible for all students who have to re-sit their exams for no fault of their own
 So unfair and unfortunate
 Wish them strength to get through this time
 # CBSE # sscso disappointing to hear about the # CBSE leak
 This is completely unacceptable & unfair to the students who have put in so much hard work & dedication
 i appeal to all the students to not let this affect their preparation & to think of it as a 2nd chance to do even better! ATB!I always hated Exams, so it angers me that students have to re write their exams
 the people who leaked it should be severely punished
 # CBSE # SSC On the second day of the Bharat Bandh on the call of the Communist Party of India (maoist), the Naxalites created a fierce situation in Bihar
 unhone do mobile toweron or teen vaahanon ko aag ke hawaale kar diya tathaa ek mukhiya ke pati kii hatya kar di
 According to police, between Dhibari and Love village of Konch police station area of gaya district, Naxalites unloaded passengers from an autorickshaw and set it on fire

 iske alaava aurangabad jile ke mali thana ke bauria gaanv main 10 se 15 sashastr naksaliyon ne ek mobile tower ko kshatigrast kar usamen aag laga di
 Mali police station in-charge Madan Mohan Singh said on Monday that the Naxalites have set fire to the system room located there
 vahiin, mujffarpur jile ke devaria thana ke dharfari gaanv main mukhiya ke pati evam praathmik krishi saakh sahyog samiti (packs) adhyaksh kii goli markar hatya kar di
 PAX President Vinay Kumar Singh alias Manan Singh, 25 to 30 uniformed Naxalites reached his house and took him into his possession and took him out and shot him dead
 apane pita ko bachaane gaye putr praveen urf chotu ko naksaliyon ne ghayal kar diya
 Manan Singh was the husband of Kamini Devi, the head of the panchayat
 police ke ek adhikari ne somvaar ko bataaya ki naksaliyon ne vahaan ek parchaa bhi choda he, jisamen 'kishanji kii maut kaa badla lekar chodenge' samet kai baaten likhi hui hai
 It is to be known that the Naxals attacked the camp of the Cobra Battalion near Dumariya Hospital in Gaya on Sunday night
 is dauraan police or naksaliyon ke bich teen ghante tak muthbhed chali, lekin koi hataahat nahin hua
 It is noteworthy that the banned CPI (maoist) has announced a Bharat Bandh from Saturday night to 12 noon Monday to protest against the death of Naxalite leader Kishenji in an encounter in West Bengal
 bhaajapa ko is baat kaa phayda mila ki uske loksabhaa chunaavon ke intjaam kii kaman mukhyamantri raghubar das ke haathon main thi, jinhen rajnatik jodtod kaa ustad mana jaataa he
 Das in 2015 won the party's simple majority by breaking up six mlas of the Jharkhand Vikas Morcha (JVM) and bringing it to the bjp's fold
 loksabhaa chunaav kaa abhiyaan bhi unhone aisi hi tarkeeb se shuru kii or march main rashtriya janata dal kii rajya adhyaksh annapurna devi ko bhaajapa main le aae or unhen koderma se party kaa ummidavaar bana diya, jahaan unhone jhavimo ke adhyaksh, purv mukhyamantri babulal marandi ko haraaya

 ajasu ke liye giridih seat khaali kar di gai thi
 50 in bjp's bag
 6 fisadi vot aae
 This is no small success, especially for a Chief Minister who is struggling with anti-incumbency and has lost six out of seven assembly by-elections held between December 2015 and December 2018
 is baar congress or jharkhand mukti morcha ne ek-ek seat jiti, jabaki jhavimo or rajd apana khaataa tak nahin khol paae

 The Congress-led opposition added a coalition, in which the country's oldest party fielded candidates for seven seats, JMM of Shibu Soren four, Jhavimo of Babulal Marandi two and RJD one

 pradhanmantri modi ne duniya ke sabase pracheenatam shahar maane jane vaale banaras ko aadhunik or viksit banane kaa vaada kiya he
 Before the election results, it seems that everything is not right in the Aam Aadmi Party
 party ke firebrands netaa or amethi se ummidavaar kumaar vishwaas ne ishaaron main naaraazgi jaahir kii he
 He claims that he continued to campaign alone in Amethi for the first three months
 unhen zyada madad nahin mili
 The workers also did not arrive
 darasal, jab aaj tak ne kumaar vishwaas se amethi main prachaar ke liye kejariwal ke der se aane ke bare main poocha gaya to unhone kaha, 'yah tay he ki log amethi nahin pahunche
 Maybe the structure is such that it is far away
 vahaan suvidhaayen nahin thim
 There were no roaming ghats and hotels like punjab-banaras
 kaaryakartaaon main kya hua pataa nahin, lekin log pahunche nahin
 Fought alone for three months
 phir banaras kaa chunaav aa gaya jo swaabhaavik he ki arvind ke liye behad jaruri tha
 The party reached there in the last stage
 arvind ke paas puure desh kii jimmedaari thi
 Kumar Vishwas has admitted that it was his party's fault to leave Delhi's government without taking public opinion
 agsit pole par pratikriya dete hue kumaar vishwaas ne mangalvaar ko kaha, 'hamase kuch galtiyaan hui hai
 Just like we had taken the opinion while forming the government, similarly we should have done it while leaving the government
 is par bahes or charchaa hoti
 Claiming that the AAP vote percentage in Delhi has increased, Kumar Vishwas claimed that the party's government had fulfilled its promise
 unhone kaha ki hamen 27 fisadi vot vidhansabha chunaavon main mila tha
 Now some exit polls suggest that our vote share has increased
 kumaar ne kaha ki ab party ko dilli vidhansabha chunaav kii taiyaari kerani he
 Kumar wished BJP well before the election results
 unhone kaha, 'bijepi ko shubhakamanaayen
 Now just ask them that now you will see our opposition, even if a man comes after winning
 'kumaar amethi se congress pratyaashee rahul gandhi par fikarey kasne se bhi nahin chuke
 He said, 'the country lived in Penn and he lived in Spain
 to main unase to behatar hum
 Kumar, who is contesting against Rahul, said, "rahul was in Amethi at 6 am on election day
 yani 4 baje hawaii jahaaj main rahe honge
 That is, he must have left home at 3 o'clock, that is, he must have woken up at 2 o'clock
 kul milakar hamane unki neend to kharaab kar hi di
 Reiterating the allegation of collusion between BJP and Congress, he said, 'narendra Modi hates Gandhi family, so why not go to Rae Bareli
 unhen laga ki rahul ko jitao, ye sansad main rahen to unke liye acha he
 ' patna main bijepi kii hunkaar raily main narendra modi to hameshaa kii tarah chhaae hi, saath-saath arun jetali ne bhi khub taaliyaan batorin
 He appealed to a large number of people at the rally to bring change and bring Narendra Modi to power at the Center
 padhie arun jetali kaa puraa bhaashan
 
 
 i have also seen the election of 1977 in lakhs of sisters and brothers from every corner of Bihar
 lekin ye utsaah jo main apane saamne dekh rahaa hum
 These are the waves of change that i see before me
 jinhen ye lehren samaj nahin aaengi
 They will flow in front of them
 aaj 44 din hue, 13 sitambar ko bhartiya janata party ne shri narendra modi ko piem pad kaa apana ummidavaar ghoshit kiya tha
 The reality of the land seems changed in 44 days
 44 din main desh kaa raajnneetik najaara badla hua najar aata he
 And today you have come in millions
 mujhe yaad he, jab chaar dashak pehle, isi aitihaasik maidan main jepi ke netritv main ek bahut bada andolan khadaa hua tha
 That movement was to remove a corrupt government
 isi maidan main jepi ke saath aakar prasiddh kavi dinakar ji ne jo panktiyaan likhi thim, manch par likhi hui thim
 Empty the throne that the public knows
 aaj jo utsaah main apane saamne dekh rahaa hum
 BJP workers have stood up to vacate not one or two throne
 ek singhasal badalegaa dilli kaa or ek patna kaa
 Those who have challenged the leadership of BJP
 bijepi kii vichaardhaara ko jinane chunauti di he
 Those who have challenged the self-respect of BJP workers
 aaj us parivartan ke liye bijepi kaaryakarta khadey ho gaye hai
 This was the movement, which was conceived by Deendayal Upadhyay and Ram Manohan Lohia 40 years ago
 upaadhyaay ji ne naaraa diya tha ki congress hataao or is desh ko bachaao
 Whenever the non-congress government came to this country, the same slogan was carried forward
 or aaj 2014 ke chunaav ke liye dilli main narendra modi ke netritv main gaiyrcongressi sarkaar sthapit karne ke liye khud ko vachanabaddh kiya he
 Friends, that is the government at the center, which has ruined the governance of the country
 itihaas kii sabase bhrasht sarkaar ye rahi he
 Has crushed the country's economy
 netritv nirashapurna he
 That is why wherever our people are going, a group of millions has stood up to welcome them
 parivartan kii lahar hameshaa bihar se uthi he
 You will again lead him by bringing 40 seats of 40

 There has been such a break on the speed of the airport express that now the date of its running again is not being decided
 airport line kii tamaam jaanch padtaal ke baad isaki 90 fisadi se zyada bearing main kharabi paayi gai he or inako abhi tak repere nahin kiya ja sakaa he
 It is clear that there is no possibility of the airport metro to resume operations
 airport metro kaa aaparishan phir se shuru karne kaa daawa yun to do maheene ke bheetar kaa hi tha, lekin abhi tak halaat aise hai ki metro ke daudane kaa kahin ata pataa tak nahin he, kyonki abhi tak to kharaab bearing hi repere nahin kii ja saki hai
 Also, many controversies have been added to these projects
 shahari vikaas mantralay ne rajyasabha main bhale hi airport metro ko jald shuru karne kaa daawa kiya he, lekin ise amalijama pehanaanaa itnaa aasaan nahin he, kyonki airport metro kaa aaparishan reliance inphra ke haath main he auradmarsi ke saath uske rishte patari se utar gaye hai
 The two are holding each other responsible for the airport metro closure
 reliance bearing repere kaa kharch dmarsi ke khate main daalane ke mood main he or salanaa fees bhi maaf karne kii maang kar rahaa he
 On the other hand, according to sources, DMRC is preparing to impose penalty on Reliance as per the terms of the agreement
 aise main agar repere jaldi ho bhi jaae tab bhi orport metro shuru hone kii raah main kai or adchane hai
 The resumption of the airport metro is no less a challenge for the government, as the issue here is not only correcting the fault of civil structure, but also the deterioration in the relationship between DMRC and Reliance, as long as these two The relationship between will not improve, the entire project will remain in balance

 Accusing the Mayawati government of adopting double standards on the issue of foreign direct investment (FDI) in the retail business, the Samajwadi Party (SP) said that with the approval of the BSP government, many Walmart stores are open in the state

 karnataka main congress-jedies gathbandhan kii sarkaar ke girane ke baad madhya pradesh main bhi aisi atakalein shuru ho gai hai
 There is a strong buzz in the political corridor that the Bharatiya Janata Party can spoil the game in Madhya Pradesh after getting power in Karnataka
 is bich madhya pradesh kii kamalnath sarkaar ko unki sahyogi party bahujan samaaj party (BSP) ke vidhayak ne sarkaar bachaane kii hidaayat de daali he
 After the Kumaraswamy government fell in Karnataka, BSP MLA Sanjeev Singh suggested to the Kamal Nath government that the Congress should handle its mlas
 unhone kaha, 'karnataka main jo sthiti bani wo congressiyon ke jane ke baad bani
 Congress should handle its legislators
 ham logon par shankaa karne kii koi vajah nahin

 However, after his treatment, party chief Mayawati suspended him
 haalanki, madhya pradesh main bhi bispi congress sarkaar main sahyogi he
 But from time to time, there has been a lack of coordination between the BSP MLA and the Kamal Nath government
 sanjeev singh bhi pehle jataa chuke hai naarazgibeete hafte hi bispi vidhayak sanjeev singh ne kamalnath sarkaar ko salaah di thi ki sarkaar ke mantri, nirdaleey or samarthan dene vaale vidhayakon kaa bhi dhyaan rakhen
 Sanjeev Singh alleged that the ministers of the Kamal Nath government neither pick up the phone nor give time to meet properly
 gauratlab he ki bispi ke sanjeev singh bhind se vidhayak hai
 BSP MLA Sanjeev Singh had said, 'there is no displeasure with CM Kamal Nath
 lekin ek baat jarur kahana chaahunga ki jo vidhayak sarkaar ko samarthan de rahe hai un vidhayakon ke prati samvedansheel hona chahie
 The attitude of some ministers is not good
 unki karypranali bhi thik nahin he
 The public has sent us here with great expectation and hope and if we do not live up to their expectations then there is no point in staying our MLA
 ham apane or janata ke saath nyaay nahin kar paaenge
 'he had said,' It is the prerogative of the Chief Minister to take or not to take someone in the cabinet
 loksabhaa chunaavon main jo parinaam aae hai unki samiksha karke mukhyamantri ko koi nirnay lenaa chahie
 Those who are independent mlas, belong to Samajwadi Party or belong to BSP should also take a decision
 'shivaraj ne kaha tha- kabhi bhi gir sakati he kamalnath sarkaarhal hi main bijepi ke varisht netaa or purv mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ne kai congress vidhayakon ke sampark main hone kaa daawa karte hue kaha ki sarkaar zyada samay tak nahin chal sakati

 assam ke mukhyamantri tarun gogoi kaa hi udhaaharan len
 At the beginning of his 14-year tenure, when he was close to 65 years old, he even danced with some World Bank officials, for which he had to bear the displeasure of his wife
 unhone un adhikariyon ko kajiranga rashtriya udyaan kii saiyr karaane kaa bhi aadesh diya taaki karj paane ke liye unhen khush kiya ja sake
 The people who like purity may object to these methods of Gogoi, but the Chief Minister was successful in his cause
 bahurashtriya agenciyon se milane vaali aarthik madad kii vajah se assam ne buniyadi dhaanche ke vikaas main lagaataar jabardast pradarshan kiya
 Gogoi's example shows an important fact in India Today's Best State Study this year — leadership and the ability to put in some extra effort play a key role in a state's performance
 do purvi rajyon assam or orissa—jahaan naveen patnayak pichley 15 saal se mukhyamantri hai—ne pichley saal se ranking main sabase badi chalaang lagaai he
 Assam, which stood at 19th position last year, has moved up to seventh place, while Odisha has climbed up from 16th position to fifth position
 in donon hi rajyon ke utthan kaa shrey vahaan ke buniyadi dhaanche main sudhaar or sookshm arthvyavastha ko jaataa he
 Among the ten smaller states, Sikkim, whose Chief Minister Pawan Kumar Chamling has been ruling for the last two decades, topped the list from the ninth position last year
 yah rajya 10 shreniyon main se chaar main chotii par rahaa he
 The success stories of India's three longest-serving Chief Ministers also show that the most tested way to win an election is to act
 yah desh bhar main chunavi ranneetikaron ko shaayad yah bhi yaad dilaataa he ki acha kaamkaaj hi vah ekmaatr rajnatik daanv he jo matadaataaon ko baar-baar aakarshith karata he

 nirantarata bhale hi vruddhi ke path ko sunishchit karti ho, lekin netritv main badlaav rajya ko aage bhi le ja saktaa he or peeche bhi
 The performance of the four states — Gujarat, Haryana, Tamil Nadu and Goa, where leadership changes occurred in 2014 and 2015 — has seen dramatic changes
 narendra modi ke baad gujarat kaa jimmaa sanbhaalanaa anandiben patel ke liye aasaan nahin tha, lekin rajyon kaa adhyayan dikhaata he ki unhone vikaas ke 'gujarat model' ko nai oonchaaiyon tak pahunchaa diya he
 Gujarat has won the Best State Award for the first time since 2012
 haryana kii arthvyavastha or paryaavaran main sudhaar dikhaai detaa he, haalanki musalamaanon or gaayon par mukhyamantri manohar laal khatter ke vichaar kattarpanthi rahe hai
 But Tamil Nadu and Goa's leadership change shows the opposite result
 sitambar 2014 or may 2015 ke bich mukhyamantri je
 Jayalalithaa remained in jail and Tamil Nadu slipped from first place last year to 20th position this year
 2003 main jab se rajyon kaa adhyayan shuru kiya gaya he tab se aaj tak yah kisi bhi rajya kaa sabase teji se hone vaala patan he
 The reason for this collapse is his worst performance in three categories
 yah krishi kii shrenee main sabase upree paaydaan se girakar 21wein sthaan par aa gaya, shiksha main tisare sthaan se girakar 13wein or buniyadi dhaanche ke vikaas main 11wein sthaan se ludhakkar 17wein paaydaan par pahunch gaya
 Similarly, the performance of Goa was also very disappointing
 goa 2013 or 2014 main lagaataar do saal chote rajyon main awwal rahaa tha
 Earlier, Manohar Parrikar, who was the Chief Minister, who won awards in all categories, was made the defense minister at the center
 unke hatane ke baad yah rajya chotii ke sthaan se girakar nauven sthaan par pahunch gaya
 He has finished first in only one category
 do anya rajya jinhone ranking main badi giravat dikhaai he ve hai punjab or uttarakhand
 Punjab, where elections are due to be held within less than two years, has fallen from second place to 11th position and Uttarakhand has slipped from the fourth position to the lowest
 in donon rajyon kii giravat kii vajah buniyadi dhaanche ke vikaas main inkaa kharaab pradarshan rahaa he
 The opposite directions of Assam, Odisha, Punjab and Uttarakhand are a sufficient indication that the growth story needs to start with infrastructure
 hamane rajyon ke akalan ke liye teen nai shreniyan bhi shuru kii hai—samaveshi vikaas, paryaavaran or swatchta—or duusari shreniyon ke kuch maapdandon main bhi herpher kiya he
 For example, in the category of governance, we are not only keeping the police-public ratio in view, but also the transfer of local self-governance has been considered

 Kim Jong Un is visiting China again after his visit to South Korea
 badi khabar ye he ki march ke maheene main china kii yatra kar chuke kim jong un america raashtrapati se milane se pehle ek baar phir china kii yatra par chale gaye hai or sabase hairaan karne vaali baat ye he ki hameshaa plane ke safar karne se parhez karne vaale kim ne uttar korea se china ke daalion shahar tak kaa safar plane se tay kiya he
 Kim is scheduled to meet with the US President on a second visit to China this month or early next month
 magar usase pehle uttar korea ke marshall kim jong un apana home work puraa kar lenaa chaahate hai
 That's why he first went to China on 27th March
 phir april kii 27 taarikh ko unhone dakshin korea kii aitihaasik yatra kii or ab ek baar phirachin pahunch karkim jong un ne puri duniya ko chaunkaa diya he
 Kim is shocked because he has visited China for the second time within a month and a half
 itnaa hi nahin vimaan se yatra karne se kataraane vaale kim jong un 07 may ko airkoria ke apane personal vimaan se china pahunche
 Before Trump, Jinping met with President Xi Jinping and North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un in a famous Dalian city on China's coast
 is mulaakaat se pehle china ke is shahar main ek uttar korian vimaan ko land karte dekha gaya
 Since then, the media of Japan and South Korea began to speculate that the aircraft may have been a high-level North Korean official or Kim Jong himself visiting China
 haalanki iske kuch der baad hi media main donon kii mulaakaat kii tasviren bhi aa gai
 In which both the leaders were seen strolling along the sea and then discussing
 pehali baar vimaan se kii videsh yatradakshin korian news agency ke mutabik kim kaa vimaan kal puri suraksha ke bich daalion airport par utraa gaya
 These photos are of Kim landing in China and then welcoming her
 kim ke china yatra par hone kaa ye shaq isliye paidaa hua kyonki daliyaan or uttar korea ke bich yatri vimaan sevaayen nahin hai
 Korean aircraft are usually not seen at this airport
 kyonki china kaa ye airport vyapaar ke liye zyada istemaal kiya jaataa he
 Earlier in the month of March, North Korean leader Kim Jong visited China and that was the first time in six years that he had gone on a foreign tour after coming to power
 is daure kii pushti tab kii gai jab wo china ke daure se waapas uttar korea laut gaye the
 Trump congratulated him for his visit to China
 On the other hand, as soon as the news of this meeting came to US President Donald Trump, he tweeted and gave his response
 trump ne chini raashtrapati ko kim se milane ke liye badhai dete hue kaha he ki isse uttar korea ke liye duniya kaa vishwaas badhegaa
 US President Donald Trump tweeted that i will talk with my friend Chinese President Xi today
 mukhya mudda vyapaar he, jahaan acchhee chijen hongi, or doosraa mudda uttar korea he, jahaan rishta or vishwaas ban rahaa he
 China will keep an eye on the talks, let us tell you that the meeting of US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un will be held in the month of June
 trump or kim ke bich ye pehali baithak hogi
 But before this meeting, Kim has given this message by visiting China two or two times that this conversation will be looked at by the Chinese
 jald tay hogi mulaakaat kii jagahjald hi ye tay ho jayega ki donon netaaon kii mulaakaat kahaan hogi
 Now the news is coming that Singapore is being considered to decide for this meeting
 sutara ne trump or unke rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar jon bolton ke bich hui baatcheet ke aadhaar par ye jaankaree di gai he
 This possibility has also increased because Trump and South Korean President Moon Jae-in have been scheduled to meet at the White House on the 25th of May
 mana ja rahaa he ki iske baad kim or trump kii mulaakaat kii jagah final ho jaaegi
 BCCI President n Srinivasan has once again rejected the resignation demands
 board ke upaadhyaksh or ipel kamishnar rajeev shukla ke aaj ke bayaan par shrinivasana ne kaha ki shukla ne vahi doharaaya he, jo maine ravivaar ko kaha tha ki main jaanch prakriya se dur rahoonga
 Srinivasan also said that the bcci's Commission of Inquiry has the right of restriction and punishment
 shrinivasana ne kaha, maine rajeev shukla kaa intervyuu dekha
 He has said that the Commission has been appointed and i should distance myself from this process, as i said in the press conference in Kolkata
 unhone kaha, maine kolkata main kaha tha ki meraa ayog se kuch lenaa-dena nahin he, jisamen niyuktiyaan, iske sandarbh main sharten or iskaa faisla shaamil he
 Shukla has only repeated this, so there is nothing new in this
 isse pehle, ipel spot phixing prakaran ko lekar rajeev shukla ne board ke sadsy arun jetali se mulaakaat ke baad kaha tha ki shrinivasana ko maamle kii jaanch puri hone tak us prakriya se bilkul dur rahanaa chahie
 Shukla said, we are worried about the image of the board
 shukla ne kaha ki jetali ke saath saare muddon par baat kii gai he or maamle kii jaanch ke liye gathit ayog main bisisiai kaa sirf ek sadsy he
 He also said that Srinivasan should keep himself away from the entire process of investigation
 shukla ke mutabik, hamane unhen suzav diya he, lekin ise maananaa yaa na maananaa shrinivasana par nirbhar karata he
 He also said that there is no need to send the recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry to the BCCI and they should be implemented directly
 board ke varisht adhikari jyotiraditya sindhiya ke virodh kii aawaaj uthaane ke baad shukla or jetali ne bhi unke sur main sur milaate hue bhartiya cricket kii chhavi kii khatir shrinivasana par board se dur rahane ke liye dabaav badha diya he
 This indicates that important board members have tightened their stance, including many active politicians and they can persuade others to make such demands
 tippaniyan Shukla told reporters after the meeting with Jaitley, he is the elected president
 hamaara yah najariya he ki yah acha hoga ki vah prakriya se dur rahen
 Jaitley also believes the same
 hamane yah suzav diya he or is mudde par faisla unhen karnaa he
 Shukla said, he (srinivasan) has told us that he is not at fault and why he is being punished
 is prakaran kaa khulaasa hone ke baad se hi shrinivasana ne adiyal rukh apanaate hue pad chhodane se inkaar kar diya he or saath hi jor dekar kaha he ki unka istipha sirf unke peeche padi media maang rahi he
 Srinivasan said, i saw the interview of Rajiv Shukla
 unhone kaha he ki ayog niyukt kar diya he or mujhe khud ko is prakriya se dur rakhana chahie, jaisaa ki maine kolkata main press conference main kaha tha
 He said, i had said in Kolkata that i have nothing to do with the commission, which includes the appointments, the conditions in relation to it and its decision
 shukla ne sirf isi kaa doharaav kiya he, isliye isamen kuch bhi nayaa nahin he
 Earlier, Rajiv Shukla had said after meeting board member Arun Jaitley about the IPL spot-fixing case that Srinivasan should abstain from that process until the investigation into the case was completed
 shukla ne kaha, hamen board kii chhavi kii chintaa he
 Shukla said that all issues have been discussed with Jaitley and the BCCI has only one member in the commission set up to investigate the matter
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki jaanch kii puri prakriya se shrinivasana ko khud ko alag rakhana chahie
 According to Shukla, we have suggested him, but believe it or not, it depends on Srinivasan
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki jaanch ayog kii siforishein bisisiai ko bheje jane kii koi jarurat nahin he or unhen sidhe lagu kiya janaa chahie
 Shukla and Jaitley have also stepped up pressure on Srinivasan to stay away from the board for the sake of the image of Indian cricket, after voicing opposition from senior board official Jyotiraditya Scindia
 isse sanket ja rahe hai ki board ke ahm sadasyon ne apana rukh kadaa kar diya he, jisamen kai sakriy rajaneta bhi shaamil hai or ve anya logon ko bhi is tarah kii maang ke liye raji kar sakate hai
 The comments shukla ne jetali ke saath baithak ke baad samvaadadaataaon se kaha, vah nirvaachit adhyaksh hai
 Our view is that it would be good to stay away from the process
 jetali kaa bhi yahi maananaa he
 We have suggested this and they have to decide on this issue
 shukla ne kaha, unhone (shrinivasana ne) hamen kaha he ki unki koi galati nahin he or unhen sajaa kyon di ja rahi he
 Ever since the episode was revealed, Srinivasan has refused to step down, taking a stubborn stance and insisting that his resignation is only seeking media after him
 unhone kaha, maine kolkata main kaha tha ki meraa ayog se kuch lenaa-dena nahin he, jisamen niyuktiyaan, iske sandarbh main sharten or iskaa faisla shaamil he
 Shukla has only repeated this, so there is nothing new in this

 In the Lok Sabha elections 2019, the BJP, riding on the wave of Narendra Modi, has returned to power with a strong mandate
 bijepi ne apane siyaasi itihaas main sabase zyada siten jeetne kaa record banaaya he
 The Congress Party, which came under the leadership of Rahul Gandhi, was completely demolished
 'hathi' ke sahare desh ke sabase bade soobe uttar pradesh main narendra modi ke vijay rath ko rokane ke mansoobey se utre sapa adhyaksh akhilesh yadav ke armaanon par bijepi ne pani pher diya he
 In such a situation, the question is that whether Akhilesh Yadav has stood on the threshold of political crisis like Chaudhary Ajit Singh? In Uttar Pradesh, SP returned to power with a landslide victory in 2012, then Mulayam Singh Yadav gave his legacy Crowned his son Akhilesh Yadav
 lekin akhilesh is raajnneetik viraasat ko barkaraar rakhane main lagaataar fail ho rahe hai
 Akhilesh has not found an effective way against modi-shah's strategy
 isi kaa nateeja he ki ek ke baad ek lagaataar 3 chunaav main sapa ko karaari haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 The SP, led by Akhilesh Yadav, had entered the 2014 Lok Sabha election battle for the first time, despite being in power in the state, he could win only 5 seats
 ye sabhi siten mulaayam kunbe kii raheen
 After this there was discord in the family and Akhilesh Yadav raised the flag of revolt against his father and uncle and took the reins of the party in his hands
 soobe kii satta main vaapasi ke liye akhilesh yadav congress ke saath gathbandhan kar chunavi maidan main utre
 The Akhilesh yadav-rahul Gandhi duo was given the slogan of the boy from UP
 soobe main donon netaaon ne jamkar prachaar kiya, lekin nateeja yah rahaa ki akhilesh yadav ko satta ganvaani padi
 Not only this, in the sp's political career so far, it got the lowest 47 assembly seats
 iske baad akhilesh yadav upi kii gorakhpur or phulpur seat par basapa ke samarthan se jeetne main kaamyaab rahe
 Under the formula of victory in the by-election, Akhilesh Yadav entered the Lok Sabha elections in alliance with Mayawati
 gathbandhan ke tahat basapa se kam siten lekar sapa chunavi ran main utari or mahaj 5 siten hi jeet saki
 sp's vote was reduced by 4% since 2014
 iske alaava mulaayam kunbe ke 3 sadsy chunaav haar gaye
 Interestingly, in the elections of 2014, 2017 and 2019, BJP in the province kept winning the election battle over a formula, but Akhilesh could not find a cut
 iske alaava unhone jitne bhi raajnneetik prayog kiye vah bhi fail rahaa, chaahe rahul gandhi ke saath gathbandhan ho yaa phir mayawati ke saath milakar chunavi maidan main utarane kaa faisla
 After the results of the Lok Sabha elections, after looking at the political career of Akhilesh and Rahul Gandhi from a political perspective, Akhilesh Yadav is much more in trouble than Rahul Gandhi
 congress party kii 5 rajyon main sarkaar he or party ke puure desh main kaaryakarta or janaadhar he
 Akhilesh's party is only in UP and the crisis is big
 akhilesh yadav ke pita or samaajawaadee party ke sangrakshak mulaayam singh yadav ne pehle hi kaha tha ki basapa se gathbandhan sapa ke hit main nahin he
 If you look at the seats, then this fact proved to be true because the SP could win only 5 seats as it had won in 2014
 lekin dimple samet unke kunbe ke kai log haar gaye
 At the same time, Mayawati got the most benefit because her party BSP reached 10 from zero in UP
 vahiin rahul gandhi bhale hi amethi se chunaav haar gaye hon lekin kerala ke vynad se bade antar se jeetne main safal rahe
 This has also increased their acceptability
 rahul gandhi kii ek safalataa yah bhi maani ja rahi he ki vah is chunaav ko modi VS rahul banane main safal rahe
 Rahul also took care of decorum in the entire election and the Congress leaders also asked him to apologize for the misrepresentation
 rahul ne puure chunaav main modi se zyada reliyaan or road sho kiye
 Rahul gave the slogan of justice, talked about employment and kept on critically questioning the central government
 vahiin mayawati se gathbandhan karne ke baad akhilesh haath par haath rakhkar baith gaye
 When Modi had held several rallies in western Uttar Pradesh, then a joint rally of SP-BSP was held in Deoband
 rahul ne akele jahaan upi main kai reliyaan or road sho kiye vahiin akhilesh-maaya keval ek darjan sanyukt reliyaan hi kar paae
 Rahul kept on attacking Akhilesh and Maya, while Akhilesh kept targeting Congress in every rally
 congress ne yahaan tak kah diya ki unke ummidavaar jeetenge yaa bijepi kaa vot katkar gathbandhan ko jitaayenge
 But he did not get any special relief from the coalition
 kul milakar 2019 ke chunaav main akhilesh or samaajawaadee party kii sthiti zyada kharaab hui he
 Rahul has taken moral responsibility of defeat by offering resignation from the post of Congress President
 At the same time, Akhilesh has tried to show that by removing all the spokespersons of the Samajwadi Party, the party's words were not kept properly in public forums, hence such a defeat has taken place
 indore se 8 baar saansad raheen sumitra mahajan ne chunaav ladane se manaa kar diya he
 She is the only woman MP in the current Lok Sabha who has been elected 8 times
 1989 se sumitra mahajan loksabhaa pahunch rahi hai
 Became Speaker of 16th Lok Sabha
 aaj unhone ek patr jari kiya jo na to pradhanmantri ko sambodhit tha or na hi party adhyaksh amit shah ko
 This letter has been issued directly to the press, in which the letter is written for publication in place of the party president
 yani chhapane ke liye
 After all, why did Sumitra Mahajan, an 8-time MP, have to issue a letter to the press
 'bhartiya janata paati ne aaj dinaank 4 april tak indore main apana ummidavaar ghoshit nahin kiya he
 Why this is a situation of indecision, it is possible that the party is hesitant to take a decision
 haalanki maine party main varishton se is sandarbh main bahut pehle hi charchaa kii thi or nirnay unheen par choda tha
 He seems to still have some confusion in his mind
 isliye main yah ghoshnaa karti hum ki mujhe ab loksabhaa kaa chunaav nahin ladanaa he
 Therefore, the party should make its decision with a free mind and make a decision without any hindrance
 'iske alaava sumitra mahajan ne kuch kaha nahin to kya matlab nikaala jaae
 There is dissatisfaction at the time of election
 log dal badalte hai
 But why did the senior leader like Sumitra Mahajan write an open letter declaring not to contest
 ummid he sab thik hoga
 If there is a rebel, no one should rebel on his behalf
 baagi hi tay karen varanaa pataa chalaa ki baagi ne khud ko sipaahi ghoshit kar diya
 The formality of dissatisfaction in the era of Prime Minister Modi and Amit Shah in the BJP has reduced considerably
 bahuton ke tikat kate hai magar koi badi baghawat nahin hui
 It becomes little thick anywhere
 hamaare sahyogi anuraag dwari ne bataaya he ki sumitra mahajan ke chunaav na ladane kaa faisla saarvajanik hote hi unke ghar bijepi ke netaaon kaa aana shuru ho gaya
 BJP has been winning there for 30 years
 aresas kaa purana garh rahaa he
 BJP has so far announced 18 out of 29 candidates from Madhya Pradesh
 kya vaaki party asamanjas main thi sumitra mahajan ko lekar
 Sumitra Mahajan is going to turn 76 next week
 party ne tikaton ke bantwaare ke liye ek maandand banaaya he ki 75 saal se upar waalon ko koi pad nahin milegaa
 When 85-year-old Murali Manohar Joshi was denied the ticket, he also issued a small statement addressing the people of Kanpur, saying that bjp's General Secretary, Mr
 Ram Lal has told me that i should not contest from Kanpur or any other seat
 Fight yah patr bhi kanpur kii janata ko likhaa tha
 No more said by these leaders, which seemed to have insulted the party
 magar gatchiroli main bhaashan dete hue rahul gandhi ko bijepi ko hindu dharm kaa paath padhaane kaa mauka mil gaya
 The bus school of Hinduism will now open
 chunaav bina muddon ke hi ho jayega
 By the way, the matter of killing with shoes was a bit more because when Advani wrote the blog after 1806 days, he did not write anything like this
 bas itnaa likhaa ki bhartiya rashtrawaad kii hamaari jo samaj he usamen ham raajnneetik asahmati rakhane waalon ko anti neshnal nahin maanate hai
 The beauty of Indian democracy is to respect freedom of thought and diversity
 iske baad adwani ne bijepi ko media se lekar sansthaaon ke sammaan or nishpakshta kaa sammaan karne vaali party bhi bataaya
 BJP grabbed this end of his article and left the first point that we do not consider any political opponent as anti national
 pradhanmantri modi ne turant hi blog ke samarthan main twit kar diya
 Presented as if Advani has stamped today's politics
 ab aap hi yaad karen, kya aapane bilkul hi kabhi nahin suna ki bijepi ke netaa asahmati rakhane waalon yaa virodhiyon ko anti neshnal, pakistan kaa samarthak kabhi kaha hi nahin
 You have not heard the talk of celebrating Diwali in Pakistan after the opponent's victory
 adwani ji ne itane dinon baad blog likhaa to kam se kam saaf-saaf likhnaa tha
 Had to say who said it and why they objected
 magar adwani adwani hai
 We remind
 congress ke menifesto ko antinational bolnaa kya he
 BJP may disagree with Manifisto, but to make it antinational, plotting plans in Pakistan, Advani may not have done a Google search while writing the blog
 aise anek bayaan mil jaaenge jahaan baat baat main asahmati rakhane waalon or aalochakon ko deshadrohi kaha gaya
 Said to be a supporter of Pakistan
 adwani ke blog kaa istamaal bijepi ke netaa certificate ke rup main kar rahe hai to congress kaa kahana he ki adwani ne bijepi ko aainaa dikhaaya he
 Did India kill Pakistan's fighter ship F-16 in Operation Balakot
 oparation balakot ke samay sarkaar ne daawa kiya tha ki bhartiya vayusena ne pakistan ke ek ladaaku vimaan F-16 maar giraaya gaya he
 He was shot down by Wing Commander Abhinandan Vardhaman and while chasing another plane, his ship crashed into the Pakistan border
 Foreign Policy naam kii amareeki patrika ne chapa he ki america ne pakistan main apane F-16 vimaanon ke bede kii ginati he or paaya ki sabhi ke sabhi vimaan maujuud hai
 Not a single plane is missing
 to phir bharat ne jis vimaan ke maar giraane kaa daawa kiya he wo kahaan he or wo kitna sahi he
 You will note that on 28 February Indian Air Force officials showed pieces of Imran missile which can be dropped from the F-16 aircraft itself
 vayusena se lekar sarkaar ne sabane pakistan ke ladaaku vimaan F-16 ko maar giraane kii baat kahi thi
 The same day Wing Commander Abhinandan was returned
 foron polisy patrika ke anusaar pakistan ne america ko bulaayaa tha ki wo aakar F-16 vimaanon kii ginati kar le
 US officials have found that it is important to note that the magazine has published this news by quoting sources
 ab bharat ko jawaab dena yaa america ko aadhikarik channel se bataanaa he ki in daavon main kitni sachai he
 The Indian Air Force has issued a statement saying that after the attack on terrorist camps in Balakot on 26 February, when Pakistan tried to respond on 27 February, India's mig-21 Bison launched Pakistan's F-16 aircraft in Nowshera sector
 Was shot in raksha se hi sambandhit ek or bayaan aaj dilli kii raajnneeti main garmi paidaa karata rahaa
 The opposition has not said anything on this
 pratyrpan nideshaalay ne agusta westland VVIP helicopter maamle main patiala court main ek anupoorak aaropapatr daayar kiya
 But it was leaked in the media a day earlier
 dilli ke patiala court ne pratyrpan nideshaalay se poocha he ki aaropapatr kaise li ho gaya
 Have to reply on 6 April
 mishael ne vikal ke zarie adaalat se kaha he ki aaropapatr adaalat main daayar hone se pehle media ko kaise li ho gaya
 Lawyer Algee's Joseph claims Mitchell has not named Kisa
 anupoorak chargeshit main congress netaa ahamed patel or misses gandhi kaa zikr he
 Christian Michel, an accused arrested in the case, has alleged that the charge sheet was leaked to the media before being presented in court
 dilli ke patiala court ne bhi pratyrpan nideshaalay ko notice jari kiya he ki chargeshit kaise media main li ho gaya
 This charge sheet mentions Congress leader Ahmed Patel and Mrs
 Gandhi
 pravartan nideshaalay ne daawa kiya he ki mishael ne poochtacha ke dauraan api or fam kaa zikr kiya he matlab ahamed patel or family
 In the diary that ED has received, AP and Fame are written like a chord
 aisa daawa kiya gaya he
 In 2012, the matter first came to light in the Italian press that a deal of 360 to 450 crores has been given in this deal of 3600 crores
 uske baad italy ke atarni general ne isaki jaanch kii
 Many people were arrested
 italy kii nichali adaalat ne sazaa bhi hui magar disbanr 2016 main italy ke supreme court ne is par apil sweekaar liya
 On 8 January 2019, the court of appeals acquitted both the accused
 sabit hua ki finamekanika ke purv president ji oresi or agusta westland ke purv siio bruno spganolini ne kisi ko rishwat nahin di
 In the court there, it cannot be proved that the company has bribed anyone in India
 italy kii adaalat main sunwaayee hui to sibiai or raksha mantralay ke adhikari bhi maujuud the
 He was later told that he did not understand anything because the hearing was being held in Italian
 bharat main bhi sibiai ne isaki jaanch shuru kii thi
 Then former Air Force chief SP Tyagi was also arrested on charges of taking bribe
 magar 12 sitambar 2018 ko es pi tyaagi ko zamaanat mil gai
 On 24 July Special Judge Arvind Kumar summoned agustawestland CEO and Finmeccanica Director G
 Orsi, including Tyagi
 tyaagi haazir hue or zamaanat mil gai magar agusta westland or finamekanika ke purv siio or president nahin aae
 Not a single foreign citizen appeared before the court
 jabaki adaalat ne chargeshit kaa sangyaan lete hue mana tha ki rishwat khaane ke paryaapt saboot hai
 Politics is taking place in this matter
 7 saal ho chuke hai lekin jaanch ke naam par media ko saamagree di ja rahi he
 Hopefully there will be a decision now
 jab italy kii adaalat ne rishwat ke aaropon ko khaarij kiya tha tab media ne ise notice bhi nahin liya tha jabaki us sunwaayee ke vakt bhartiya paksh bhi vahaan maujuud tha
 How many allegations were there regarding the Rafale case
 kitne khulaase hue magar jaanch nahin hui
 Just denied
 chunaav samay he
 Is the Income Tax Department targeting the opposition at the time of elections
 vijaywada main dow
 He sat on a dharna in front of Ambedkar's statue, gave his memorandum to the statue itself and left black balloons on which the picture of Prime Minister Modi was made
 naidu ne kaha ki iskar vibhaag ke adhikari tidipi, diemke or samaajawaadee parti, bisapi or janata dal secular
 Aam Aadmi is targeting the leaders of the party
 sirf vipaksh ke netaaon ke yahaan chaape maare ja rahe hai
 Naidu warned the Income Tax authorities not to act at the behest of Delhi's ruling party
 agar aisa karenge to badi keemat chukaani padegi
 If it is according to law then all the leaders will cooperate
 tidipi netaaon ke khilaaf is tarah ke chaape bijepi viares or tii aar es kii saazish he
 Naidu said that everything should be under the Election Commission once the elections are announced
 sabhi dal baraabar hai
 What is happening right now is against the election
 congress ke baad samaajawaadee party ke ghoshnaa patr main bhi sarkaar kii javabdehi par lautne kii baat he
 Concern about this question is that the resources of the public with the government are not being distributed equally among the people
 ghoshnaa patr ko padhate hue lag rahaa he ki bharat kii raajnneeti ab is sawaal ke saath karavat le sakati he
 It is repeatedly mentioned that the rich are getting richer and the poor are becoming poorer
 yah sawaal jaise jaise mukhar hoga bharat kii raajnneeti main amiron kaa akelaapan badhata jayega vaise abhi unheen kaa upree varchasv bana hua he
 The SP has written in its manifesto that it is getting richer and richer
 10 fisadi ucch jati ke log 60 fisadi rashtriya sampatti par kaabiz hai
 The level of income growth of the poorer section is lower than inflation
 samaajawaadee party ne apana slogan diya he ki ham log mahaparivartan ke liye sankalpit hai
 2
 5 karod se adhik kii sampatti rakhane waalon par 2 percent atirikt tex lagegaa
 Emphasis has been laid on creating a bracket to collect more taxes than the rich
 har saal 1 lakh sarkari naukariyaan dene kaa vaada kiya gaya he
 100 percent debt will be waived
 zaruuratmand mahilaon ko 3000 masik pension di jaaegi
 Three times more houses will be given under Lohia Awas Yojana than Ked's scheme
 in gharon main do kamare honge, ek shauchalay, solar panel, pankhaa, lite, pani kii suvidha hogi
 On one hand, Jaitley is saying that he will increase the tax base and reduce corporate tax
 do baar ke bajet main alag alag catagori main korporate tex kam bhi kiya gaya
 On the other hand, Akhilesh is saying that the property of more than 2
5 crores will be charged an additional tax of 2%
 amiron se zyada tex liya jayega
 If all these are debated in elections, then enjoy it but elections are not held on them
 sapa ne apane ghoshnaptr main likhaa he ki rashtriya suraksha chahie, tathakthith rashtrawaad nahin
 It is written that pseudo nationalism of BJP is more dangerous for our national security than any external force
 ham raajnneetik phaayde ke liye sena or sainikon ke istamaal ko purna rup se pratibandhit karenge
 Will establish regiments in all states
 ahir bakhtarband regiment or gujarat infentry regiment kii sthapana karenge
 Akhilesh often raises the point that martyrs are always more than UP
 gujarat se koi shahid nahin hota he
 So is there a comment on that Gujarat Infantry Regiment will be established
 kya yah dilachasp nahin he ki gujarat infrentry banane kii baat upi se uth rahi he
 Akhilesh has also said that Congress and BJP are equal and said that there will be no difference between the two
 emtianal or beasenel ke sankat kii khabaren to aa hi rahi thim abhi shaam ko madar deyari ke sankat main bhi hone kii khabar aa gai he
 According to the news of Sandip Singh of Indian Express, Mother Dairy sought help from the Prime Minister
 IL&FS (infrastructure Leasing & Finance Services) main 190 karod kaa uskaa nivesh dub gaya he
 You know that IL&FS is going through a crisis
 isamen jin companiyon ne nivesh kiye the, ise jinhone lone diya tha, vah lautaa nahin paaya
 Mother Dairy Fruit and Vegetable Private Ltd (MDFVL) invested last year
 thik usee samay yah company diphalt karne lagi thi
 The letter to the Prime Minister states that farmers depend on Mother Dairy Fruit and Vegetable Private Limited for their livelihood, having invested their money in IL&FS
 IL&FS ke paisa nahin chukaa paane ke kaaran madar dairy fruit and vegetable privet limited ke paas nagdi kaa sankat ho gaya he
 He is not able to pay his farmers money

 Investigation is going on in the case of IL&FS '
 is par 91000 karod kii dendaree ho gai he
 BSNL employees take out march in Delhi
 karmchaariyon ne sarkaar se 4ji spectrum kii maang kii he
 He says that due to not giving 4G to BSNL, he was lagging behind in the competition and is going through an economic crisis
 desh bhar se aae hazaron karmchaariyon ne western court se jantar mantar tak march nikaala
 The concern of these employees is that the government is not deliberately giving 4G spectrum so that private companies benefit
 beasenlael ke lagaataar ghate main hone se selary par bhi sankat aa gaya he
 Recently there was news that the company is considering retiring more than 50,000 people
 beasenel par chantni kii talwaar latak gai he
 The election may be postponed, but what will happen after that, these employees do not know
 haalanki beasenal ke siio kaa media main bayaan aayaa tha ki viares ke liye achche package par vichaar kiya ja rahaa he jo sabake hit main hoga
 The CEO tweeted that the Ministry of Communications is alloting 4G spectrum to bring BSNL back on track
 to kya yah mana jaae ki karmchaaree sahi kah rahe the ki 4ji na dene ke kaaran hi beasenel kii seva bekaar ho gai or graahakon ne nakaarna shuru kar diya
 Even after this, the employees are not sure

 bhaajapa ne rashtriya salaahkaar parishad dwaara taiyaar sampradayik hinsa rokthaam masauda vidheyak kii kadi aalochana karte hue brihaspativaar ko kaha ki yah is anumaan par aadhaarit he ki sampradayik hinsa ke liye hameshaa bahusankhyak samudaay hi jimmedaar hoga
 BJP said that if this draft law is made then it will spoil the mutual relations between the communities in the country rather than maintaining communal harmony
 samprag adhyaksh sonia gandhi kii adhyakshata vaali rashtriya salaahkaar parishad dwaara taiyaar kiye gaye sampradayik tathaa lakshith hinsa (insaaf tathaa kshatipurti tak pahunch) vidheyak ke masaude kaa rajyasabha main vipaksh ke netaa arun jetali ne vishleshan karte hue yah baat kahi he
 Jaitley said that in this draft, more black law than anti-terrorist TADA is now proposed by this government
 jetali ne kaha ki yah masauda vidheyak un saamaajik udhyamiyon kaa kaam prathit hota he, jinhone gujarat ke tajurbe se yah sikh liya ki kis tarah varisht netaaon ko us aparaadh ke liye jimmedaar tehraaya jaae, jiske ve asal main doshi nahin hote
 "this draft bill is built on the assumption that only members of the majority community will spread communal unrest, members of the minority community will never do so and similar acts against the majority by minority communities will not be considered a crime," he said
 jetali ne kaha ki masaude se aisa prathit hota he ki yon durvyavhaar tabhi dandaneey hoga jab vah alpsankhyak samudaay ke kisi sadsy ke khilaaf ho
 Jaitley said in his analysis that the draft also shows that hate propaganda will be considered a crime only if it is against a minority group
 bhaajapa ke varisht netaa ne kaha ki is masauda vidheyak main aparaadh ko atyadhik bhedbhaav ke saath pun:paribhaashit kiya gaya he
 From this it seems that if a member of a minority community commits a crime against the majority community, it will not be considered punishable
 unhone masauda vidheyak main raashtra ke dharmanirpeksh taane-bane ke zikr par bhi sawaal uthaae
 Jaitley said that the draft states that communal and targeted violence refers to violence that harms the secular fabric of the nation
 lekin dharmanirpekshata kya he, ise lekar bhi tarksangat raajnneetik matbhed ho sakate hai
 Jaitley said that the social entrepreneurs of the National Advisory Council have shaped the draft of such a dangerous and discriminatory bill
 lekin yah bhi ascharyajanak he ki kis tarah is parishad kii raajnneetik pramukh (sonia gandhi) ne masaude ko manjuuri de di
 Significantly, after the 2002 riots in Gujarat, various sections of the society demanded a law to prevent communal violence
 enesi ne is masaude ko 28 april ko antim rup diya tha

 to is par digvijay singh ne ek jimmedaar jan netaa hone ke kaaran us baat ko mana he

 ) Union Transport Minister and senior BJP leader Nitin Gadkari, while shrugging off the party's 'good Day' slogan used during the Lok Sabha elections, said that it is a bone stuck in our neck
 mumbai main udyog jagat ke ek kaarykram ke dauraan jab gadakari se desh ke halaat ke bare main poocha gaya ki achche din kab aaenge, to gadakari ne kaha ki achche din kabhi nahin aate
 He said that this thing was actually teased by Manmohan Singh
 pravasi bharatiyon ke kaarykram main tatkaaleen pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne kaha tha ki achche din aane ke liye intjaar karnaa hoga
 In response to that Modi said that if our government comes, good days will come
 gadakari ne kaha ki yah baat unhen piem modi ne hi bataai
 Gadkari said, we only used the words 'good days' and should not be taken in a literal sense
 iskaa matlab yah samajha janaa chahie ki pragati ho rahi he
 Instructing the media not to misrepresent his statement to the media, he also said that our country is an ocean of unquenchable souls, whoever has something here needs more
 vahi poochta he ki achche din kab aaenge? tippaniyan Gadkari said, 'if a person has a bicycle, he would like a motorcycle, then when he buys a motorcycle, the next target is a car, so no one ever feels that the good days have come
 ' It is worth mentioning that in the last Lok Sabha elections, the BJP had focused its election campaign on the catchline that 'good days' will come
 centre main narendra modi ke netritv main sarkaar banane ke baad ye sawaal bijepi ke netaaon se lagaataar puche jane lage ki achche din kab aaenge? During an industry event in Mumbai, when Gadkari was asked about the state of the country when the good days would come, Gadkari said that the good days never come
 unhone kaha ki yah baat asal main manmohan singh kii chhedi hui thi
 In the program of the diaspora, the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said that good days will have to wait
 usee ke jawaab main modi ji ne kaha ki hamaari sarkaar aegi, to achche din aaenge
 Gadkari said that this was told by PM Modi to him
 gadakari ne kaha, hamane keval 'achche din' shabdon kaa prayog kiya or ise shabdic arth main nahin liya janaa chahie
 It should be understood that progress is being made
 gadakari ne media ko unke bayaan ko galat andaaj main pesh na karne kii hidaayat dete hue yah bhi kaha ki hamaara desh atrupt atmaaon kaa mahaasaagar he, yahaan jiske paas kuch he, use or chahie
 He asks when will the good days come? The comments gadakari ne kaha, 'agar kisi vyakti ke paas cycle he to vah motorcycle chahega, phir jab vah motorcycle kharid letaa he to aglaa lakshya car hoti he, isliye kisi ko kabhi yah mahasoos nahin hota ki achche din aa gaye
 ' ullekhneey he ki gat loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ne apane chunavi campan kaa puraa jor is kaichaline par hi tikaa diya tha ki 'achche din' aaenge

 Priyanka Gandhi played a big role in the alliance between Congress and SP during the UP election
 khulkar unhone gathbandhan karaane kii kaman thami thi or safal bhi rahi thim
 But his success was not reflected in the election results
 sapa ke saath congress bhi dub gai
 Why in the politics of Priyanka in difficulty, many Congress leaders have been talking about giving entry of Congress to Rahul Gandhi more than many times
 haalanki, priyanka ne khud ko raibareli tak simit rakhaa
 She kept avoiding questions of coming into politics
 pehali baar unhone khulkar raajnneeti karne ke liye upi kaa vidhansabha chunaav chunaa
 Even if not in the campaign, but at least at the strategic level, tried to prepare the ground for the Congress
 unhone aage aakar akhilesh or unki patni dimple yadav se baat kii
 He played an important role in the alliance between the two parties
 congress kii ore se pehali baar kisi bade netaa (ahamed patel) ne twit kar kaha tha- congress-sapa gathbandhan main hai kaman level or PG (priyanka gandhi) ne ahm bhoomika nibhaai
 Congress will never want Priyanka Gandhi to take command with failure
 fail hui priyanka-dimple kii jodikaha jaataa tha ki sapa se gathbandhan ke liye pehle prashanth kishor congress kii ore se baat kar rahe the
 But Priyanka Gandhi himself took command in the last days of December and January
 rahul gandhi aage nahin aae the
 Priyanka Gandhi talked to Dimple Yadav more than Akhilesh and there was an alliance between the two parties
 kaha jaataa he ki of da beet priyanka or dimple kii jodi acchhee thi, par ve chunaav main kamaal nahin kar saki

 Police has registered a case against 3 people including the victim's friend
 maamla jabalpur ke ranjhi thane kaa he
 According to the police, Nandani, an 18-year-old friend of Sarita (name changed), had Kalalchadia to get her a mobile
 jiske baad nandani ne sarita ko dhokhe se apane dost ankush ke ghar ranjhi bulaayaa
 The accused named Monu Pandit and Ankush, who were present there, gang-raped the victim, threatening to form MMS
 peedita kisi tarah unke changul se chhootakar police thane pahunchi
 The victim told the police that she was an aggressor
 jiske baad peedita kii taharir par police ne aaropee monu pandit, ankush or nandani ke khilaafgangarepaka maamla darj kar jaanch shuru kar di
 Police is currently on the lookout for the accused
 china kaa sauvaan bhrashtachari ''tiger" mongolia kii seemaa par sthit chipheng city se march 2015 main pakadaa gaya tha
 The Communist Party newspaper also announced this
 china main, raashtrapati shi jinping kii durdaant anti karpshan agency sisidii (central kamishan for dispilin acshan) kaa nishaanaa ban rahe viypi logon ko tiger and kralij (sher or makkhi) virgon main baanta jaataa he
 Tiger means communist party's big politicians and senior government officials (chief Ministers, ministers, state presidents of political parties in India, government secretaries equivalent) and flies are small political activists or officers
 sisidii pichley kareeb chah saal main 1,800 bade nishane laga chukaa he jinamein 180 rajnatik or 139 prashasnic ''tiger" pakade gaye hai
 We should also have expected results like demonetisation
 jaahir he ki kaale dhan ke khilaaf abhiyaanon kii safalataa is baat se tay hoti he ki kitni badi machhliyaan sajaa ke jaal main fansaai gayi
 Soot cleaning campaigns are not meant to increase revenue as the government has no shortage of options for earning
 notebandi ke jaal kaa makasad sarkaar ke liye rajasav laana nahin balki un badi rajnatik, prashasnic va kaarobaari machhliyon ko pakadana tha jinke saamne kanoonee jaal chote pad jate hai
 And in this case, great expectations are justified from demonetisation because: For the first time a big and organized campaign on black money was conducted in India
 kaale dhan or bhrashtachar ke bade maamalon main hasan ali se lekar ramling raju tak jaanch agenciyon ke paas naakaamiyon kaa dher laga he
 However, the result of the ban on demonetisation in high-profile cases is as follows: Contrary to the claims of the big corrupt people, there is neither large scale action nor big hold-up under demonetisation
 china main ''sher va makkhi" milakar teen lakh se zyada logon ke khilaaf karrwai ho chuki he
 Even in Malaysia, last year, large scams of government officials were found and huge cash was recovered
 notebandi ke baad bainkon main jamaa ke jariye iskar vibhaag ko jaankariyaan jarur mili hai lekin kaale dhan ko lekar is tarah ke sutara jaanch agenciyon ko pehle bhi milte rahe hai, mushkil unhen adaalat main sabit karne kii he
 In this case, the record of the Modi government is the same as any other government in the past
 sabhi bade ghotaalon main aaropee jamaanat par reeha ho chuke hai
 It is worth considering the fact that why she could not create fear of China or Malaysia among demonetisation, corrupt people and black money? Why are big fish still out of the net? Seeing demonetisation in light of similar campaigns of other countries This confusion may sound: anti-corruption campaigns were not seasonal in other countries equivalent to India
 ve sadhe, nape-tule or lakshith the jo lagaataar chal rahe hai or nattejey de rahe hai
 No country in the world started off by giving amnesty to the corrupt before they were caught
 bharat notebandi se pehle iske dauraan kaale dhan rakhane waalon ko do maukey die gaye
 The anti-corruption agencies of China, Malaysia and South Africa lashed out directly at the big corrupt
 aam logon ko qatari main nahin laga diya gaya
 These campaigns were led by a very powerful agency in countries successful in tackling corruption, with clear legal powers such as the Anti Corruption Agency of South Africa and President Jacob Zuma
 bharat main lokapal kahaan baithta he, kabhi pataa chale to bataaiega?bhrashtachar nirodhak abhiyaanon ke saath jaruri kanoonon or jaanch agenciyon main paardarshita kaa puraa dhaancha taiyaar kiya gaya
 For example, China's CCDI is also catching its officials involved in corruption
 malaysia kii anti karpshan agency afasaron kii aay ghoshnaaon ko khangaal kar yah jaanane kii koshish kar rahi he ki inaki shaano-shaukat bhari jindagi kaa raaj kya he
 i do not know when big fish will get caught in the net in India? India's biggest campaign against black money, sacrificed by the people, will not be lost in history like this? Will the country remember that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has banned the ban On February 8, 2017, the Rajya Sabha had said, "stern action against the dishonest will give strength to the believers"? bambe stock exange (bisai) ke 30 sheyaron vaale sensex main somvaar ko baari giravat dekhi ja rahi he

 banking or power sector ke sheyaron main aaj sabase zyada giravat dekhne ko mili he
