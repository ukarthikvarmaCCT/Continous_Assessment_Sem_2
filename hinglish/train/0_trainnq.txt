 Your personality consists of many things
 or is sabamein ahm kirdaar nibhaati he aawaaj
 The sweet voice automatically pulls itself towards you
 aap chaahakar bhi usase apana dhyaan nahin hataa pate
 Your eyes start looking for the owner of that voice
 chaah hoti he, to bas uske didaar kii, jisane aapke kadamon ko baandh liya he kisi mithi zanjeer kii tarah
 Many times we find people whose speech captures us like a charm
 or shaayad yahi vajah he ki ham unki baton zyada tavajjo dete hai
 This is not the magic of his voice, then what else is there
 kudarat kii is nayab niamat ko banaaye rakhana aapaki jimmejadaari he
 If you are thinking of making a career with the help of voice, then it becomes more important for you to take care of it and if you do not want to do so, then it is your duty to take good care of your voice
 kaise banaae rakhen aawaaj kaa nashamdhur aawaaj kaa surur chadhataa rahata he
 But, in order to maintain this intoxication in your voice, it is important to protect it from problems
 shwaas se judi samasyaon se bachein:sabase pehle saans kii koi bhi takalif yaa sinus hone par doctor ko jarur dikhaaen
 a good voice only sounds on the rhythm of the breath
 agar aapaki chahat he ki aapaki aawaaj kaa andaaj sahi rahe, to apni saanson kii awajahi ko bhi saamaanya rakhie
 Try to live in an air conditioned environment
 ye acchhee awaz ke liye phydemand hota he
 Stay for some time in a warm environment from a cold environment
 aawaaj ko sahi rakhane ke liye munh se shwaas naa len, tej pankhe ke sidhe neeche yaa saamne kabhi naa soen
 Avoid cold and hot air
 donon hi naak or gale ko prabhavit karti hai or aawaaj sahi tarah se nahin nikalati
 It can also cause cough complaints
 khanpan kaa rakhen dhyanapaki aawaaj sahi rahe, iske liye jaruri he ki aapkaa khanpan sahi ho
 Irregular routines and wrong eating habits can lead to replicas or acid problems
 isse gale main kuch atakana, khaansee, baar-baar galaa saaf karnaa, jeebh par jamaav, bronchitis jaisi shikaayatein ho sakati hai
 If you are connected to the world of voice then try to have a simple meal
 adhik mirch-masaale, telyukt khaanaa, adhik chaay, coffee, sheethal peya yaa sharaab naa pien
 Also, do not take chocolate, dry fruits etc
 before meals
 iske alaava paan, paan masala, gutkha, tambaakoo jaisi chizon se dur rahen
 Keep these things in mind: Do not do any voice related exercises during severe cold, acute allergies, nose-throat infection
 koshish karen ki lagaataar 45 minute se zyada naa bolen
 Avoid loud speaking, shouting and loud voice
 dhul, mitti se bachein
 Especially, people with nose allergies should try to avoid dust, smoke, mites, fungus etc
 baar-baar galaa saaf karne kii aadat naa daalen
 Get appropriate treatment in case of problem
 adhik mechap, baalo ke yaa kisi bhi prakaar ke spray kaa bahut sadhvani se or kam upyog karen
 Do not let the throat dry during singing, bhajan, speech or conversation
 bich-bich main pani ke ghunt pien
 Drink light, lukewarm, honeyed water continuously during the program
 tanaav se bachein kyonki shaareerik or maansik donon hi tanaav aawaaj par dushprabhav daalate hai
 So get full sleep and take rest
 agar aap aawaaj kii duniya se jude hue hai, to bheed bhari, shorgul vaali partiyon se bachein, kyonki aisi jagahon par jor-jor se baat kerani padati he, jisase swar yantra par tanaav aa saktaa he
 You can keep your voice correct by trying all these methods
 yaad rakhie ishwar ne jo aapako aawaaj kaa uphaar diya he uski kadra karnaa or use bachaae rakhana naa sirf aapke liye phydemand he, balki aisa karnaa aapaki jimmedaari bhi he

 Holding the finger of sorrow, anger and tears, this country first came out on December 16 last year to compete with wolves among humans, but what happened? What happened to the anger that seemed to lose its temper? What happened to the flame of those candles raised in the hands of stones? What happened to the sorrow that had moistened the eyes of the country beyond? Did everything change after December 16? Or are the dates only changed? After 16 December 2012, newspaper headlines are witness to the fact that that environment did not affect the wolves

 In a five-star hotel, an elderly man called an elderly man was thinking of ways to make his granddaughter-aged girl drink wine and darken her mouth

 Emotion once again arose on this anniversary of that shameful, dreadful night

 Every daughter crosses the threshold of the house in the morning and goes into the world, every heartbeat reminds of Nirbhaya, and there is no rest till she comes back

 It is said that he always applies his ointment to every sorrow of the world
 is gam ko bhi ek saal ho gaya, par pataa nahin kyon is gam par vakt bhi apana maraham nahin laga paaya
 It seems that this sorrow of December 16 will never go away
 12 din wo aspataal main apni saanson se ladati rahi or sab log apane andar ladate rahe
 His spirit left the body that was his greatest enemy

 If she loses, do we win ??? After that, will there no longer be a victim of impunity? Will those 12 days remain just a memory for us? Or will we force ourselves to think that why does it happen that a girl cannot live with all her freedom in this society with respect? The rapes that are not exposed, the curtains are exposed, the rapists who make the house walls Is sitting inside, how to avoid it? Punishing rapists in a society in which women are deemed to be of use, can there be any answer? And the biggest question is whether the responsibility of this crime is only on the men who do not know what they are Or are there also those women who have been covering their antics for their sons, their fathers, their brothers and their husbands for centuries? puuran ab windies kii ore se 4 tii-20 maichon main nahin khel paaengevanade match ke dauraan gend se chhedchhad kii baat sweekaar kiwesteindies ke wicketiper ballebaaj nicholas puuran ko afghanistan ke khilaaf tisare vanade international match ke dauraan gend se chhedchhad kii baat sweekaar karne ke liye buudhvaar ko chaar maichon ke liye nilambit kar diya gaya

 The third ODI was played on Monday in Lucknow
 antarrashtriya cricket parishad (ICC) ne bayaan main kaha, ‘khilaadiyon or khilaadiyon ke sahyogi staff se judi isisi aachaar samhita ke level teen ke ulanghan kii baat sweekaar karne ke liye nicholas puuran ko chaar nilamban ank die gaye hai
 The ICC said, "the video footage showed that the cricketer was scratching the surface of the ball with a thumb nail, followed by Rule 2 of the Code on Puran

 lakhanu metro rail kaa udghaatan 5 sitambar ko grahamantri rajnath singh or yogi adityanath karenge, lekin usase thik pehle siyasat garm ho gai he
 On Sunday, two pictures were released by Akhilesh Yadav, in which Akhilesh is seen inaugurating it
 isi tasviir ke jariye akhilesh ne nae udghaatan kii hawa nikaalane koshish kii he
 However, Akhilesh Yadav did a symbolic inauguration as CM
 akhilesh yadav ke pravaktaa rajendra choudhary ne photo post karne ke saath hi likhaa he ki taiyaar metro rail ko enosi dene main jaanboojhkar deree kii gai taaki metro kaa shrey liya ja sake
 In a photo, Akhilesh is giving the keys of Metro Rail to women Metro Drivers
 samaajawaadee party ke mukhya pravaktaa rajendra choudhary ne kaha he ki bina kisi kaam ke naam kamaane kii kala main bhaajapa ne maharath hasil kar lee he
 In the last five months, the BJP government did not even introduce any of its plans, but the schemes implemented by the Samajwadi Government are telling them its achievement
 is sambandh me taaja udhaaharan yah he ki metro rail kaa dobaaraa udghaatan kar janata kii aankh main dhul jhonkne kaa ek or kartab karne kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 The truth is that the BJP government at the Center had been consistently putting obstacles in the metro project
 enosi dene main bhi khub deree kii gai kyonki upi main samaajawaadee sarkaar thi
 The people of Lucknow have not forgotten that on December 1, 2016, the then Chief Minister of the Samajwadi Government, Akhilesh Yadav, had himself conducted a trial run of the metro rail
 unhone do driver ladakiyon ko laal rang kii metro rail kii chaabi dekar is trial ko hari jhandi bhi dikhaai thi
 Rajendra Chaudhary said, 'akhilesh Yadav has provided a great convenience to the citizens by giving a gift of Metro Rail in the capital
 unhone hi smart card or wifai suvidha kii vyavastha kii he
 Arrangements have been made to write the names of its stations in Hindi, English, Urdu
 akhilesh yadav ne lakhanu ke atirikt agra, kanpur, meerut, noida tathaa varanasi main metro rail pariyojna kii report taiyaar karaane kaa kaam bhi shuru kar diya tha, jise bhaajapa sarkaar ne thande baste main daal diya
 The convenience given by Akhilesh Yadav to Lucknow, other districts in the ABBJP Raja will remain deprived of it, because the BJP neither has the ability to take bold decisions in public interest nor has the foresight that knows how to make the impossible possible
 yah akhilesh ji kaa hi vijan he jo unhone metro jaisi badi yojana lagu kii thi

 ' The camscanner app is quite popular and is currently removed from the Play Store
 security company Kaspersky ne kaha he ki is ap ke nae apadet kii vajah se phone mailaware se prabhavit ho saktaa he
 The camscanner app is quite popular
 agar aapke smartphone main bhi ye ap he to khabar aapke liye jaruri he
 There is a big problem and this problem is once again for Android users
 kuch samay se lagaataar google play store main mailaware vaale eps mil rahe hai
 Kaspersky Lab has said that some dangerous modules have been found in the popular document scanning app Camscanner on the Google Play Store, which are either pushing ads or downloading apps without consent in the user's smartphone
 is ap main ek tarah kaa Trojan Dropper paaya gaya he jisaki madad se havers aapke smartphone ko torget kar sakate hai or kisi bhi tarah ke mailaware se aapke smartphone ko nuksaan pahunchaa sakate hai
 Malware has been found in camscanner and may have affected many users and stolen login details as well
 google play store se kuch samay ke liye is ap ko hataaya bhi gaya
 The reason for its removal from the play store was the dangerous module found in it
 iskaa ped varjan ab bhi google play store par he
 This app named camscanner has been downloaded more than 100 million times from Google Play Store and its rating is 4
 6 he
 Generally people use it to scan any document
 Kaspersky ne kaha he, ‘camscanner asal main ek sahi ap tha or iske koi galat iraade bhi nahin the
 This app earns money through in-app purchases and advertising
 lekin ye ab badal gaya he or haal ke varjan main Malicious Module vaali edwartiging kii librari he’is modul ko Trojan Dropper Android OS Necroin bataaya ja rahaa he
 Overall, it is understandable that it can run another component inside the app itself and its Trojan downloader can affect the device with malware
 aapako kya karnaa chahie?agar aapke smartphone main bhi camscanner he to mumkin he aapkaa divaais isse prabhavit ho
 If you want, you can also remove it for some time
 chunki is ap main dikkat nahin he iske ek varjan main samasya he
 Therefore, soon the company will issue a statement and tell about the new update
 iske alaava agar mobile main anti virus he to phone ko isse scan kar len
 There has been continuous news of malware apps on the Google Play Store for some time
 sawaal ye he ki google ke un bade daavon kaa kya jo wo google play store ko lekar karti he
 The company claims that millions of crores of apps are scanned with Google Play Protect, so that no wrong app comes on Google Play Store
 lekin isse ulat aap hameshaa khabar padhate honge ki google play store par mailaware vaale eps mili hai
 What is the result? Actually the result of such a malware attack is not found immediately
 havers kaaphi smart hote hai wo jaankaree ikaithi karke dhire dhire istemaal karte hai
 For example, your smartphone was affected by a Trojan app and all your information was stolen
 ab ye jaankariyaan havers kaaphi samay baad ek ek karke yuj karte hai taaki kisi ko ye andaja na ho ki iske liye koun sa ap jimmedaar he
 This is the reason that after getting affected by any malware app you do not get its results immediately

 The Supreme Court has termed the debate as misleading that the new provision made in the Income Tax Act to make Aadhaar mandatory for filing income tax returns is biased and divides taxpayers into two categories

 rigerv bank of india kii ek haalia report main anumaan lagaaya gaya he ki 2024 tak lagbhag 4,00,000 bhartiya chaatr videshi uniwarsities main daakhila lenge
 These figures clearly show that India is the second most important country after China in sending its students abroad for higher education
 philhal duniya bhar main 50 lakh se adhik chaatr apane desh se baahar shiksha praapt kar rahe hai or inamen bhartiya chaatro kii kaaphi badi sankhya he
 Countries like America, Canada and UK are the first choice of Indians in getting foreign education
 iske baad singapore, china, australia or germany va france jaise anya europea deshon kaa number aata he
 According to the RBI report, 85% of the total Indian students going abroad for higher education go to these countries
 haalanki, kai anya deshon kii uniwarsities main bhi daakhila lene vaale bhartiya chaatro kii sankhya badi he
 Tarun Mathur, Chief Business Officer, Policy Bazaar, says that covering medical expenses while going abroad for higher education is one of the most important reasons to buy travel insurance
 yah kehane kii jarurat nahin he ki videshon main medical kharche bharat kii tulana main kaaphi mahange ho sakate hai
 For example, a doctor's consulting fee in the US is between 300 and 400 dollars, which is around 20,500 to 27,000 rupees for India
 unhone kaha ki travel insurance na hone par agar ek chaatr videsh main biimaar padataa he, to use apane ek saptaah kaa bajet sirf doctor se paraamarsh / immergency room visit chargeej main hi kharch karnaa padegaa, jisamen dawaaon kii keemat shaamil nahin hoti
 In such a situation it is very important to get insurance cover so that the expenses incurred on falling ill can be avoided
 maathur ne kaha ki student travel insurance aapako medical immergency ke liye vyapak kawarej dene ke saath hi anya sambhavit mushkilon ke liye bhi suraksha detaa he, jaise ki padhai main rukaawat, sponcer protection, uniwarsity kii manyata radd hona, laptop / teble ko nuksaan, safar ke dauraan bagez, passport yaa anya jaruri dastavej kho janaa
 In such a situation, it is very important to ensure that some very serious aspects are kept in mind while purchasing a student travel insurance
 sabase mahatvapurn pahaluon main se ek yah dekhnaa hoga ki aapkaa student travel insurance aapaki uniwarsity dwaara jari dishanirdeshon kaa paalan karata ho
 If the coverage of the Student Travel Insurance Plan is not in conformity with the guidelines of the University, the concerned University will have the full right to reject the insurance waver benefit of the student or to cancel the admission
 america or canada kii adhiktar uniwarsities kii yah maang hoti he ki antarrashtriya chaatr apane liye ek aisa insurance plan rakhen jo pehle se maujuud bimariyon, drugs kii aadat, pregnancy or maansik bimariyon ke sabhi kharcho ko kisi bhi sab-limit ke bina cover karata ho
 Apart from this, some universities also insist that international students buy travel insurance from the insurance companies of their home countries
 videsh jane vaale bhartiya chaatro ke liye bhi yah behatar hoga ki bharat kii insurance companiyon se hi travel policy khariden kyonki yahaan keemten behad kam hoti hai or chaatro ko adhik phaayde bhi milte hai

" pakistan ke pradhanmantri imran khan (imran khan)ne america main jin kapadon ko pahana, unhen lekar vivaad khadaa ho gaya he
 Reports published in the Pakistani media said that on one hand it has been claimed that Imran's wife Bushra Bibi sewed the clothes from a common tailor
 lekin ek mahange diziner store ke kuch or daawey ne maamle ko pechida bana diya he
 Imran Khan wore the traditional Pakistani salwar kameez and his favorite Peshawar sandal while meeting US President Donald Trump and other US officials
 imran ke nazdikiyon kaa kahana he ki imran ne saadhaaran kapade pahane or ise kam silaai lene vaale darji se silvaya gaya tha
 But, the luxury clothing store 'mohatram' in Islamabad patted his back, stating that he had sewed seven salwar kameezes for the Prime Minister

 agar upar se jacket pahananaa ho to, uskaa charge alag hota he or vah bhi kuch kam nahin hota
 The US has given approval for the sale of technical support to Pakistan's F-16 fighter jets
 It is not clear whether Imran wore the same clothes in the US as claimed by 'mohatram'
 jab diziner store ke siio fahd saf se is bare main poocha gaya to unhone kuch bhi kehane se manaa kar diya
 Another expensive store 'la Faberica' has also claimed that it had created a Westcoat for the Prime Minister
 lekin, usne bhi yah saaf nahin kaha he ki uski taiyaar westcot hi imran ne america main pahani thi
 Zulfi Bukhari, the Prime Minister's special assistant in the affairs of expatriate Pakistanis and in human resource matters, dismissed designer clothes saying that Imran's wife Bushra Bibi had bought these clothes herself and sewed them from a local tailor who does not take much stitching

 In Badaun, BJP MP Maneka Gandhi told former SP leader Amar Singh, who was arrested in a note scandal in exchange for votes, that Singh should open his mouth now, because he is now in jail and he should not be afraid of anyone
 uttarapradesh ke bareli jile ke aanwala kshetra se bhaajapa saansad menka ne kshetra ke badhgrast ilaakon kaa daura karne ke baad kaha ki vot-note cond main jise phayda hua, use koi chhu bhi nahin rahaa he
 Along with Singh, innocent BJP leaders have also been jailed
 singh ko ab to apana munh kholana chaiye, kyonki ab wo jail main hai or unhen kisi kaa dar nahin hona chaiye
 He said that Amar Singh was flattering the Congress
 unhen ummid thi ki unke do-teen kareebi log kendra main mantri ban jaaenge, lekin aisa nahin hua
 The ruling BJP at the Center has become an attacker on the Congress after the Supreme Court rejected the SIT investigation plea for Justice Loya's death
 bijepi kii ore se ek ke baad ek sheersh netaaon ke bayaan aa rahe hai
 After the court's decision, the country's law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad also targeted the Congress, saying that the case was not of the public interest but of the Congress
 kanoonmantri ne kaha ki bijepi or bijepi ke adhyaksh ke khilaaf isko lekar raajnneetik ladaai banane kii koshish kii gai
 BJP has become very aggressive on Congress and Rahul Gandhi after the Supreme Court's decision in the Justices Loya case
 pehle bijepi pravaktaa sambit paatra ne press conference karcongressor rahul gandhi par nishaanaa saadhaa, phir kendriya mantri mukhtaar abbaas nakvi ne rahul gandhi par hamalaa karte hue kaha, 'congress party ko desh se maafee maangani chahie
 Pappu should focus on his sin
 ' iske baad kanoon mantri ravishankar prasad ne bhi bijepi mukhyalay main press conference kar supreme court ke nirnay ke baad rahul gandhi or congress ko nishane par liya
 He said, 'this case was of Congress interest and not of public interest
 bijepi or bijepi ke adhyaksh amit shah ke ahit ke liye cese file kii gai thi
 The national president of the party was stigmatized, so it was filed
 bijepi isaki kadi ninda karti he
 Charges were made by our party president on behalf of Rahul Gandhi, it was a politically motivated matter
 janhit prerit nahin tha
 'what will Rahul Gandhi, when asked by Rahul Shankar Prasad asking questions to Rahul Gandhi, said that Rahul Gandhi was moving forward in this matter
 raashtrapati ke paas pratinidhimandal lekar gaye or hamaare adhyaksh ke khilaaf bhi aarope lagaae
 Accused against BJP, but now the Supreme Court's decision has come
 us par rahul gandhi ko kya kahana he
 Speaking in an aggressive tone after the verdict, Ravi Shankar Prasad said that despite repeated defeats in the people's court, the Congress is now trying to advance politics through the court corridor
 kendriya mantri ravishankar prasad kaa kahana he ki har kisi ko court main jane kaa adhikaar he
 The country is free
 supreme court kaa faisla aane se pehle hamane, hamaari party, mantriyon, or amit shah ne is maamle par kuch nahin bolaa, kyonki maamla court main tha
 But after the decision of the Supreme Court, Congress should respond
 jajon ke maamle main tippanee nahinunhone kaha ki janata kii ladaai janata ke bich ladi jaani chahie na ki court ke madhyam se, court kii garima gira kar
 Rahul Gandhi apologizes on this issue
 desh ke saamne congress party benakaab ho gai he
 The Law Minister said, 'the decision of the Supreme Court is final and i do not want to comment on the case of the four judges
 'supreme court ke faisle par congress party ne sawaal khadey kiye
 After the decision, the Congress said that many questions in this case are still unresolved
 randeep surajevaala ne kaha ki jaj loya kii maut ke baad do or saathiyon kii bhi maut hui thi
 There were several allegations in this case
 maamle kii nishpaksh jaanch honi chahie
 He raised many questions in the case
 surajevaala ne kaha ki aaj kaa din kaaphi dukhad he, jaj loya kii maut kaa jaanch maamla kaaphi gambhir tha
 He said that he was hearing the Sohrabuddin case in which Amit Shah's name came up
 supreme court ke is faisle ke baad bhi kai tarah ke sawaal baaki hai
 There was a lot of uproar in the government and opposition on the triple talaq bill in Rajya Sabha, the upper house of parliament
 rajyasabha kii aaj kii kaarywahi kaaphi hangaamedaar rahi
 On the one hand, the Congress is adamant on sending this bill to the parliamentary committee, while the government is refusing to send the bill to the parliamentary committee
 rajyasabha main isi baat par sarkaar or vipaksh ke bich khub hangaamaa hua or isi ke maddenjar sabhapati ne aaj kii kaarywahi ko kal tak ke liye sthagit kar diya he
 In the Rajya Sabha on Wednesday, the entire opposition united and clashed with the government, disrupting the debate and insisting on a demand that the bill be sent to the Select Committee for voting
 instent tripal talaak ko gaiyrkanoonee ghoshit kar uske liye teen saal tak kii kaid kii sazaa kaa praavdhaan karne vaale bill ko loksabhaa main pichley saptaah hi paarit kar diya gaya tha,jahaan centre sarkaar khaase bahumat main he
 Sources said that this bill will now be passed only in the next session of Parliament, because now the committee will have to be constituted and then the committee will review the bill and suggest changes in the bill
 sarkaar is bill ko rajyasabha main bhi isi satr main paarit karwaane kii koshish kar rahi thi,jo shuukravaar ko samaapt ho rahaa he
 But since the government does not even have a majority in the upper house, and two allies - the Shiv Sena and the Telugu Desam Party - are not supporting them as well
 inke alaava ediemke tathaa biju janata dal jaise mitra dal bhi is mudde par sarkaar ko samarthan nahin de rahe hai,or chaahate hai ki vidheyak ko select cameti ke paas bhej diya jaae
 Rishi said in a statement, 'I remember that i had a fight with my girlfriend and i was sad

 ' Kangana Ranaut and Rajkummar Rao's film 'judicial Hai Kya' has been released this Friday
 kai vivaadon ke baad relies hui is film ko bollywood ek celebs se hi nahin balki critics or darshakon se bhi achche rivyuu mil rahe hai
 Everyone likes Kangana and Rajkumar's work
 aise main ummid lagaai ja rahi he ki ye film apane pehle din 4 karod rupee kaa collection kar sakati he
 However, judging by the way the film is being liked, it would not be wrong to say that Kangana's judgmental is there, it can go ahead by demolishing the box office estimates
 agar aapako yaad ho to shahid kapur kii film kabir singh se bhi thikthak opening kii ummid kii gai thi jabaki is film ne apane pehle din to badi kamai kii hi thi, saath hi apane pehle weekend par bhi baari keemat batori thi

 jajmental he kya sirf apane opening de par hi nahin balki opening weekend par bhi badi kamai kar sakati he
 Viewers are liking this film, due to which there are chances of getting the benefit of Word of Mouth
 iske alaava iske rivyuu bhi positive hai, jiskaa phayda ise hona pakkaa he
 Let me tell you that the story of Kangana Ranaut and Rajkumar Rao's Judgment is whether the story of two brain patients Bobby and Keshav is complicated
 is film main kangana or rajkumaar ne jabardast kaam kiya he
 The film is being praised for its story, actors' performance and twist and turns
 neend kise pyaari nahin hoti, neend ke bagaiyr aap agle din apana kaary thik dhang se nahin kar pate
 But a research has also shown that sleeping too much puts your eyesight at risk
 jin logon ko zyada sone kii aadat he vah yah jaan len ki yah ek prakaar kii beemaari he
 Excess sleep is a disease
 a research conducted by doctors has found that sleeping too much is dangerous
 isse ankhon par bura asar padataa he or vyakti hameshaa ke liye andhaa bhi ho saktaa he
 British researchers say that people sleeping more than eight hours may have problems with eyes, which can also make them blind forever
 marijon se baatcheet ke baad niklaa nishkarshyahi nahin, vyakti ke sapane dekhne main bhi badhotaree ho jaati he
 By the way, the part of the pupil of the eyes helps you in making the last decision

 But it makes a difference because of sleeping more
 ye shodh california ke ek santhaan main kiya gaya, jisaki aguwai kar rahe doctor ne kul 1003 marijon ke saath baatcheet ke baad ye nishkarsh nikaala he
 This research has been published in 'retina Journal'

 chhattisgarh kaa anti karpshan beuro do iees adhikariyon ke itane dabaav main aayaa ki usne centre sarkaar se abhiyojan kii anumati milane ke baad bhi donon kii giraftaar nahin kii
 Neither showed interest in gathering evidence against him
 naagarik aapurti niyam ghotaale main fanse rajya ke purv khaadya sachiv alok shukla or managing diarector anil tuteja kii bhoomika kii jaanch aarthik aparaadh shakha (EOW) ne band kar di he, jabaki baabuon or ekanutent samet 14 afasaron ke khilaaf EOW ne adaalat main chaalaan pesh kiya he
 The EOW seized Rs 90 lakh of commission from the Chamber of Civil Supplies Rules MD Anil Tuteja in this scam
 ab iees lobby ke dabaav EOW ghutane tech rahaa he
 Usually, the corrupt officer against whom the EOW takes action is arrested soon
 chaalaan bhi tay samay seemaa ke bheetar prastut ho jaataa he
 But in this case, excessive laxity is being done
 jabaki EOW donon hi afasaron ke khilaaf pukhta saboot kaaphi pehle hasil kar chukaa he
 Due to this, the process of arrest was started against both the IAS officers
 sabooton ke aadhaar par hi centre sarkaar se abhiyojan kii sweekruti maangi gai thi
 The Center gave the sanction of prosecution for a long time
 iske baavjood EOW ne maamle ko thande baste main daal diya
 The officers have threatened to threaten that both the officers have threatened the government that if they are arrested, they will open the black letter of this massive corruption
 ve is baat kaa bhi khulaasa karenge ki kamishan kii rakam or kin afasaron or rajanetaaon ko pahunchaai jaati thi
 Significantly, during its raid, EOW had made some pages of a diary public
 in pannon main un rasukhadaaron ke naam darj the, jinhen kamishan kii moti rakam milti thi
 This diary has become a hug for EOW
 bataaya jaataa he ki is diary ke khulaase se mache bavaal ke baad EOW khud maamle kii lipapoti main jute gaya he
 However, according to eow's ADG Mukesh Gupta, after getting the prosecution sanction, the case of IAS Tuteja and Shukla has been kept in pending
 unhone kaha ki maamla ucchstareey he, isliye dastavej or sakshya jutaya ja rahaa he
 Despite the approval of the prosecution, the file closure Corruption Bureau has almost closed the file for investigation of the role of IAS Alok Shukla and Anil Tuteja involved in the Civil Supplies Corporation scam
 is maamle main EOW kii bhoomika bhi sandigdh ho gai he
 Because even after the approval of the prosecution from the Central Government in 2016, till date, the arrest of both IAS officers has not been issued even notice to ask for their remission
 is maamle main 18 logon ko aaropee banaaya gaya tha
 Most of the accused were arrested
 EOW ke chaalaan pesh karne ke baad se hi 4 aaropee faraar he
 Currently only 2 accused are in jail and 12 accused are out on bail
 bataa den ki kheti kisaani ke sarkari kaarobaar main naagarik aapurti nigam kii badi bhoomika he
 This corporation annually procures thousands of crores of paddy, rice and other food items
 iske jariye hi peedies system main khaadya padaartho kii aapurti hoti he
 In the purchase and sale of food items, the officers put a commission of crores in their pockets every month
 isi silsile main EOW ne chhapamar karbade paimaane par chalarahi kamishankhori ke gorakhdhandhe kaa khulaasa kiya tha
 But now the EOW has itself become a victim of bureaucracy

 Goods and Services Tax (GST) came into effect on Monday, two years are completed
 1 july, 2017 ko desh main aitihaasik tex sudhaar kii yah vyavastha lagu hui thi
 There has been a long debate in the country about GST
 aaj bhi isaki safalataa or asafalataa ko lekar charchaa hoti he
 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, who played a key role in implementing GST in the last Modi government, has highlighted its importance by writing a blog on the completion of two years of GST
 kya kaha jetali nepurv vitt mantri arun jetali ne blog main likhaa he ki jiesti ko lagu karnaa aasaan nahin tha
 GST can be analyzed appropriately after looking at its implementation in the last two years
 unhone kaha he ki sangheey sanrachana main centre or rajya donon sarkarein vastuon par apratyaksh kar lagaatin thim
 States had many laws which gave them the right to tax at different points
 aise main jiesti lagu karne kii raah main badi chunautiyaan thim
 The first challenge was to get the states to agree
 kyonki unhen lagata tha ki jiesti lagu hone ke baad ve kar lagane kii apni swaittata kho denge
 The second biggest challenge was to reach an agreement in Parliament
 rajyon kii chintaaen dur kar unhen sahamat kar liya gaya
 When GST came into force, all the 17 tax-related laws were merged into one
 is prakaar desh main single taxesan kii vyavastha lagu ho saki
 VAT charges first 14
 5 pratishat, utpaada shukla12
 Had to pay 5 percent
 sabhi karo ko milakar upabhoktaaon ko 31 pratishat tex adaa karnaa padataa tha
 Many returns had to be filed
 kai inspectors kii bhi jaanch hoti he
 But GST changed this whole scenario
 aaj keval ek kar he, online ritern kii suvidha he
 After two years, it can be said without any contradiction that GST is consumer friendly
 jiesti ke pehle upabhoktaaon kii jeb par kaaphi asar padataa tha
 The last two years have seen the GST Council reducing tax burden on consumers in every meeting
 ek kushal kar pranali nishchit taur par behatar vyavastha kii ore le jaati he
 Consumer goods have been brought under the category of 18 percent, 12 percent and five percent tax

 karnataka main chunaav prachaar kaa aagaaj karne aaj congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi bellari pahunche
 Here, Rahul Gandhi started the 'jan Ashirwad Yatra'
 is dauraan unke saath loksabhaa main vipaksh ke netaa mallikarjun khadge or mukhyamantri ke
 Siddaramaiah was also present
 apni chaar din kii karnataka yatra main sabase pehle rahul bellari pahunche
 During this time he also met the party workers present here
 jiske baad lakhon kii sankhya main pahunche party kaaryakartaaon kii maujuudagi main rahul ne diya jalaakar chunaav prachaar yatra kaa shubharambh kiya
 The public should decide - who is truthful, who is false, while addressing the public meeting during this time, he said that the people of Karnataka have to decide what they believe
 rahul ne is dauraan unke saamne do vikalp bhi die
 He said that on one side there is Congress, Siddaramaiah ji and I, while on the other side there is BJP and Narendra Modi
 'rahul ne janata se aahvaan kiya ki jo sach bolta he aap us par yakeen karen, kyonki jhooth bolne waalon se karnataka kii janata ko koi phayda nahin pahonchega
 Rahul claimed that Modi ji does not fulfill the promise he made
 unhone bataaya ki modi ji ne 15 lakh rupaye khate main bhijwane kaa vaada kiya tha, lekin ek rupaya bhi nahin aayaa
 -PM Modi promised 2 crore jobs every year, when we questioned in Parliament how many jobs the central government gave, he gave a figure of 450 in 24 hours
 -sansad main modi ji ne bhavishya kii baat nahin kii, sirf congress or itihaas kii baat karte rahe
 At the same time, earlier Mallikarjun Kharge said that when Sonia Gandhi won the Lok Sabha elections from Bellary seat, the fortunes of the Congress changed
 thik vaise hi bellari se shuru ho rahi jan aashirwad yatra se na sirf karnataka chunaav main jeet sunishchit hogi, balki 2019 ke aam chunaav main bhi congress kii fatah hogi
 Rahul will also visit temples here after Sandhodhan
 mana ja rahaa he ki rahul apni soft hindu kii chhavi ko barkaraar rakhana chaahate hai
 Therefore, they will also visit religious places
 lingayat samudaay ko saadhane main jute rahulrahul gandhi apni 4 din kii yatra main 10 se 13 farvari tak hyderabad-karnataka ilaake kaa daura karenge
 During this time he will go to Bellary, Koppal, Gulbarga and Raichur
 iske baad rahul huligamma mandir darshan karne jaaenge or vahaan se gavi siddheshwar math bhi jane kaa kaarykram he
 Gavi Siddheshwar Math is also known as Lingayat Math
 darasal, jis kshetra main rahul yatra kar rahe hai vahaan lingayat samudaay kii aabaadi sabase zyada he
 In such a situation, Rahul's visit to Gavi Siddheshwar Math is trying to bring this community to the court of Congress
 lingayat samudaay ko bijepi ke kor vot ke taur par bhi dekha jaataa he
 With all this, Rahul Gandhi can also visit religious places of minority community
 jaankaree ke mutabik rahul mandir-math ke saath dargah bhi jaaenge
 Why start with Bellary? Actually, in 1999, Sonia Gandhi contested her first election from Bellary Lok Sabha seat
 unhone is seat se bijepi kii sushamaa swaraj ko haraaya tha
 During that election, Rahul Gandhi had also been on a campaign for several days
 iske baad 2013 ke vidhansabha chunaav main saat saal baad congress ko satta main waapas laane main isi bellari kaa bada yogadan tha
 Because Siddaramaiah, who was the leader of the opposition in 2010, took a march from Bengaluru to Bellary in protest against the mining mafia Reddy brothers
 mana jaataa he ki is padayatra ke baad hi logon ke bich congress ne apni jad majboot kii thi
