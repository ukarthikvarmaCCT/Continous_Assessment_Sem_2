 # SOTY2 — taran adarsh (@taran_adarsh) May 17, 2019 It is believed that the collection of this film of Tiger Shroff, Tara Sutaria and Ananya Pandey is going to be difficult
 is film kaa muqabla shuukravaar ko release hui ajay devgan kii 'de de pyaar de' or hollywood film 'jon vik' se he
 Ajay Devgn and Tabu's film is getting excellent response
 iske alaava hollywood film jon vik kii frenchizi ko bhi darshakon ne apana pyaar dikhaaya he
 In such a situation, it seems a little difficult for Tiger's film to join the 100 crore club

 prabhas kii madhvated film saaho kharaab verde of mouth ke baavjood recordtod kamai kar rahi he
 After Saho's weak story, what is being criticized the most is the Hindi dubbing of Prabhas
 saaho actor kii pehali bollywood film he
 In this sense, the actor thought it better to speak his dialogues in Hindi
 film kii relies se pehle marketing stretiji main prabhas kii hindi dabing ko kaaphi tarjeeh di gai
 But this strategy seems to be the biggest mistake of the makers
 mekars ne sochaa hoga ki prabhas ko hindi bolte hue dekhnaa phens kii excitement ko or badhayega
 Hence, there was a lot of discussion in Prabhas's Hindi dubbing promotional event
 magar film relies hone ke baad maaloom padaa ki prabhas ko hindi par kaaphi kaam karnaa hoga
 While speaking Hindi several times in Saaho, South Indian touch comes in Prabhas's accent
 isse pehle bahubali frenchiji main tivi actor sharad kelkar prabhas kii aawaaj bane the
 His voice was well-suited to Prabhas' personality
 sharad kii aawaaj main bahubali jaisaa dam kham tha
 Sharad's dubbing and acting of Prabhas had such a great synergy that people didn't even know that it was not Prabhas' real voice
 View this post on instagramdarlings! It’s # Saaho time and the trailer is here for you all to see! # saahoonaugust30 # Saaho @shraddhakapoor @sujeethsign @neilnitinmukesh @apnabhidu @chunkypanday @arunvijayno1 @mandirabedi @maheshmanjrekar @sharma_murli @vennelakish @uvcreationsofficial # bhushankumar @tseries
 official @officialsaahomoviea post shared byprabhas (@actorprabhas) onaug 10, 2019 at 6:59 am PDT If the makers did not cash in on Prabhas's Hindi dubbing before the release of Saaho, the actor might not have been criticized so heavily today
 ye bhi mana ja rahaa he ki darshako cinemahol main bahubali kii aawaaj ko man main lekar gaye, aise main jab unhen prabhas kii tuuti phooti hindi ko sunanaa padaa to ve niraash ho gaye
 There is no doubt that weak dialogue delivery has also affected Prabhas' acting in Saaho
 vaise prabhas mehnatee actor hai
 Hopefully, they will overcome the shortcomings in speaking Hindi soon
 khayr, log chaahe saaho kii jitani bhi aalochana karen lekin movie ke safal box offis aankadon ko nazarandaaj nahin kiya ja saktaa

 But this same disciple Babu Deva was also the reason for Guru Ji's death

 Just before the crucial meeting of the National Council, the dialogue between the two opposing factions within the AAP is on the verge of breaking down, as neither side is willing to bow down to important issues

 With the goal of bridging the lack of trust between the two factions, it was common practice in the talks that started last week that both camps would focus on resolving the issue
 yadav or bhushan ko aap kii raajnneetik maamalon kii samiti se nikaale jane ke baad vishwaas main kami ai thi
 However, the root cause of the dispute is the implementation of some important topics such as the involvement of volunteers in the decision-making unit of AAP, autonomy of its state units, bringing the party under the purview of RTI and appointment of Lokayukta at the state level
 donon paksh vivaadaaspad muddon ke sambhavit hamalon ke siddhant or vyavhaaryata par atake hue hai
 However, sources also indicated that the two camps are making a last-ditch effort to save the talks

 K
 gupta ne bataaya ‘haalanki varden ke aarope sandigdh lagate hai lekin hamane is maamle kii jaanch ke aadesh diye hai
 Doubts on the warden's complaint also arise because she did not reveal anything to her members during the National Women's Commission delegation's visit to Banda Jail
 ’ unhone bataaya ki karagaar mahanireekshak yogesh shukla ko karagaar varden shahanaz begum ke aaropon kii jaanch kar aaj shaam tak report saunpane ko kaha gaya he
 a minor girl belonging to a backward caste, a victim of the alleged rape of BSP suspended MLA Purushottam Naresh Dwivedi, was lodged in Banda jail on charges of theft

 ' ravivaar kaa din he
 It's ten o'clock in the night tivi par kamedi sho chal rahaa he
 Azhar film team members Emraan Hashmi and Nargis Fakhri have arrived there for the promotion
 tabhi aurat bane kamedian kii entry hoti he, or vah naragis ke naam kaa uccharan is dhang se karata he ki donon hi celebrity asahaj ho jate hai
 Kapil Sharmathoda, who is unable to show the same lightness as before
 kapil sharmaapane da kapil sharma sho ke saath dobaaraa tivi par laute hai or toilet jokes crack kar rahe hai lekin har chand koshish ke baavjood ve pehle jaisaa jalawaa kaayam nahin kar paa rahe
 While a few days ago there were reports from Comedy Nights Bachao sets that Akshay Kumar lost his temper because of crossing the jokes with Lisa Hayden
 udhar, kharaab reating kii vajah se life oke par aane vaala sho kamedi classes bhi of air ho chukaa he
 Levels of Comedy Falling in Reality Shows Actually, this comedy is the result of falling levels of comedy in reality shows and repeating the same things that the audience has stopped putting in these serials
 pichley aath saal se sab tivi par kamedi serialtarak mehta kaa ulataa chashmaake saath date produsar asit kumaar modi kehete hai, ''dusron ko hansaana behad mushkil hota he or dusron kaa majaak bananaa behad aasaan
 Charlie Chaplin used to make fun of himself and laugh, so he is immortal
 dwiarthi samvaad or dusron kaa majaak banaakar hansaane kii kala zyada der tak kisi ko baandhe nahin rakh sakati
 "something similar happened with the comedy shows coming on TV
 pichley saal bhar se inaki reating dhalaan par he, or kai sho to channel waalon ko hataane pade hai jabaki kai sirf isliye chalaane pad rahe hai kyonki pratidwandvi channel unhen chalaa rahaa he
 Because of which the level of comedy has declined
 doharaav dekhne ko mil rahaa he, or majaak ke naam par foohadataa kaa chalan badha he
 The world of comedy reality shows debuted on television on June 22, 2013 with Comedy Nights with Kapil Sharma
 shuruyaat main 26 episods ke liye bana yah sho 24 janvari, 2016 tak jari rahaa
 Kapil became a Bollywood star, making his debut as a stand-up comedian in 2005, and his show became one day a week
 is vajah se channel ne 5 sitambar, 2015 ko kamedi nits bachaao launch kar diya
 Krishna Abhishek and Bharti commanded it
 sho lokapriyata ke paaydaan par teji se bhaagane laga
 On the other hand, due to a rift with Colors, Kapil launched his show The Kapil Sharma Show on Sony TV in April 2016
 is bich colors ne krishna-bharti ko kamedi nits live de diya
 However, it was only in 2015 that the falling level of comedy was hinted at when Comedy Nights with Kapil Sharma reached out to promote his film, Sonam Kapoor said on a double-whammy, "you call it a family show?" Was losing its edge
 darshakon ko nahin mil rahaa nayapanis tarah ke sho main nayaapan na hone or foohadataa badaae kii vajah se darshakon kii dilchaspee bhi ghatane lagi he
 Rajat Tyagi of Delhi says, "these people are getting physical for laughs
" aadmi aurat ban jaataa he, or ab to bharti bhi ladkaa banakar aa rahi hai
 Many times they come down on the melee
 kya hansaane kaa yahi tarika he?" rajat kaa sawaal ekadam sahi he
 There was a time when directors like Hrishikesh Mukherjee and Basu Chatterjee used to make the audience laugh out of their dialogues and simplicity
 lekin sho ke dauraan ek actor kaa duusare par haath chalaanaa yaa auraten banakar guttham-guttha ho janaa ab aam ho gaya he
 Like Gaurav Dubey used to come as a foreign character in Comedy Nights Live and he was dragged out of the house every time
 haal hi main kamedi nits bachaao par housephul-3 kii team pahunchi to vahaan team ke saath cards kaa game khelaa gaya, jisamen haarane vaale ke sir par pani daalaa gaya
 Now it is a matter of thinking what kind of laughter it is which can only come by pouring water on one's head
 udhar, sambandhit channelon kii piaar team ne is babat kisi tarah kii tippanee karne se inkaar kar diya
 But Asit admits, "A joke we make among friends, we cannot do it among family
" isi tarah tivi par hone vaale majaak ko bhi rachanaatmak or family ko dhyaan main rakhkar hi bananaa hoga
 "perhaps these TV shows have forgotten situational comedy and natural jokes
 in sho ko dekhakar lagata he ki tiarapy kii reating ke liye yah sirf ek-duusare se zyada shorgul machaana chaahate hai
 As a result, these shows have become a headache
 lohani madhyapradesh paryaton ke ayukta or emdi bhi rah chuke hai
 Apart from this, he was also the CMD of ITDC and during that time he had also billed the then Minister of State for Tourism Vinod Khanna for the food which was worth millions
 bataaya jaataa he ki yah dilli ke janpath hotel kaa bill tha jahaan se rajyamantri apana khaanaa mangavaya karte the
 After sending Lohani's bill, the Minister of State paid it without any objection
 jahaan tak gaekwad maamle kaa sawaal he to raajnneetik hastkshep kii vajah se pratibandh to hataa diya gaya lekin lohani or unki team jis tarah netaaon kii 'dadagiri' ke khilaaf aakhir tak ladati rahi, uski prashansa vaaki main kii jaani chahie
 As far as the Gaekwad case is concerned, the ban was lifted due to political interference, but the way Lohani and his team continued to fight against the 'dadagiri' of the leaders till the end, it must be truly appreciated
 uttar korea ke videsh mantri ri yong ho ne apane desh ke parmaanu hathiyaaron ko ‘nyaay kii talwaar’ qaraar diya he
 Russia's state-run news agency 'taas' has quoted North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho as saying that US President Donald Trump's statement to the United Nations in September was "provoking war"
 bataa den ki kuch din pehle trump ne sanyukt raashtra main apane bayaan main aagaah kiya tha ki agar unke desh or uske sahyogiyon kii raksha karne kii aavashyaktaa padi to america uttar korea ko ‘puri tarah tabah’ kar degaa
 He will not leave without punishing America, he said that North Korea's nuclear weapons are deterrent, so that it can be protected from America
 saath hi unhone kaha ki uttar korea ke samrik balon ke paas atoot shakti he, jo aakraamak america ko dandit kiye bina nahin chodenge
 Lessons to be taught to Americans
 He said that North Korea's military and its people are constantly demanding Americans to be taught a lesson

 The aviation company suspended the abused employee when the case was exposed

 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has repeated the sentence of tightening the rules once again on the PNB scam case
 vittamantri arun jetali ne saat saal se ho rahe 11,400 karod rupee ke punjab neshnal bank (pienbi) ghotaale ko nahin pakad paane ko lekar niamakon kii aaj aalochana kii
 
 unhone kaha ki desh ke niamak netaaon kii tarah javabdeh nahin hai
 Speaking for the second time this week on the scam, Jaitley said that the association of employees with the scamsters is disturbing
 kisi ne isapar aapatti nahin kii, yah bhi pareshaan karne vaali baat he
 He said that regulators should keep a third eye open to detect and prevent fraud
 iti global bijness summit main unhone kaha ki udhyamiyon ko naitik kaarobaar kii aadat daalane kii jarurat he kyonki is tarah ke ghotaale arthvyavastha par dhabba hai or ye sudhaaron evam kaarobaar sugamawa ko peeche dhakel dete hai
 The comments unhone kaha ki karjadaata-karjadaar ke sambandhon main aniatik vyavhaar kaa khatm hona jaruri he
 He said, "if the need arises, the rules will be toughened to punish the persons involved
 ’ The finance minister also criticized the bank management for not performing its duties
 unhone kaha ki bank main kya chal rahaa he isse sheersh prabandhan kii anbhigyata or aparyaapt nigaraanee chintajanak he
 (from input language) unhone kaha ki niamakon ko dhokhadhadi kii pahchaan evam inhen rokane ke liye teesri aankh khuli rakhni chahie
 At the ET Global Business Summit, he said that entrepreneurs need to get into the habit of ethical business as such scams are a blot on the economy and they push back reforms and ease of doing business
 tippaniyan He said that it is necessary to end immoral behavior in the relationship of lender-lender
 unhone kaha, ‘yadi jarurat padi to sanlipt vyaktiyon ko sajaa dene ke liye niyamon ko sakht kiya jayega

 Republic 2
 0 namoodaar ho rahaa he
 Whatever the speed, there is a serious effort to bring it
 21veen sadi kaa doosraa dashak itihaas main isi baat ke liye janaa jayega ki isamen narendra modi sarkaar ne bharat ko ek hindu ganatantr banane kii sachetan, iradatan or patibaddh koshish kii shuruyaat kii
 Their reasoning behind this is - if Pakistan and Afghanistan can call themselves Islamic Republics, and our another Muslim-majority neighbor Bangladesh can declare Islam as their state religion, then why can't Hindu-majority India become a Hindu Republic? is? The passage of the Citizenship Amendment Bill is a prelude to this change in the coming years and decades
 bharat ne 1952 ke baad se 17 sansadeey chunaav dekhe hai
 Political parties have won and lost elections
 sarkarein or pradhanmantri aae-gaye hai
 Barring an unsuccessful attempt to impose a dictatorial regime during the Emergency (1975–77), the Indian state and its democratic institutions, including the media, have been largely unaware of the change of political power
 samaaj bhi siyaasi dalon kii badalati niyati ke niyantran se takreeban baahar rahaa he
 But what has begun to happen after two major elections in this decade, which ends in a few days, is something different - quite different and malicious
 modi kaa 2014 main satta main aana or phir 2019 main use or bhi tagade bahumat ke saath majboot karnaa, ye bhartiya rajya or samaaj ke vikascram main koi saamaanya uplabdhi nahin hai
 They bring forth the role of this plan of the Sangh Parivar — an ideological family, part of which is our ruling party — in which the state of India is transformed into a Hindu state, Indian society from a Hindu-majority society to a Hindu majoritarian society, and finally India
 It involves the conversion of the nation into a Hindu nation
 modi ne jis 'nae bharat' kii rachana kaa vaada kiya tha, yah vahi he?angrejon ke shashan se hasil kii gai aazaadee vastav main us sangharsh kii parinti thi jisamen hinduon, musalamaanon, sikhon or anya samudaayon ne rashtriya ekta kii ek prerak misaal pesh karte hue hissaa liya tha
 Even the tragic partition of India cannot deny this reality
 par vah aazaadee hasil karne ke baad ke saat dashakon main pehle kabhi musalamaanon ko apni hi jameen par itnaa paraayaa nahin mahasoos karaayaa gaya jitna ab karaayaa ja rahaa he
 India has never seen such an aggressive Hindu conquests before
 dharmanirpekshata bhartiya samvidhan, rajya or samaaj kii aadharshila rahi he
 He was attacked like never before
 bhartiya janata party ke shashan kaa sabase bada makasad ab yahi he ki is aadharshila ko prabhavi or kanoonee taur par bhi hataakar use rajya or samaaj donon ke str par 'sabase pehle hindu' ke siddhant se badal diya jaae
 Ask yourself — has Narendra Modi confirmed his commitment to secularism even once after becoming Prime Minister in May 2014? The Prime Minister himself is not making any attempt to hide his abstinence from secularism, so the large section of his supporters are dismissing it as an excuse for 'secularism' or appeasement of Muslims
 ek samudaay ko rashtriyatavihin kar dena yaa or nahin to desh main uski jagah ko kamatar kar dena—yahi naagarikta sanshodhan vidheyak or neshnal register of citigens (enarasi) kaa chipa makasad he
 This law essentially discriminates against citizens on the basis of religion, thus violating Articles 14 and 15 of the Secular Constitution of India
 yah kanoon banaakar modi sarkaar kah rahi he ki bharat musalamaanon ke bajaae hinduon kaa zyada he
 Should anyone ever prove that the current leadership of the BJP believes in the same 'two-nation theory' that the Muslim League had proclaimed before the partition to demand a separate 'muslim nation', then it now exists in front of them is
 yah to mahaj isi tarah ke kai or bhedbhaavpurn kanoonon / nitiyon kii shuruyaat bhar hogi
 It is clear that when the Supreme Court gives its verdict on the constitutional validity of the Citizenship Amendment Bill, it will undergo a rigorous examination of its independence and loyalty to the Constitution
 par ham ise lekar bhi zyada ashaavadi nahin ho sakate
 Without declaring a state of emergency and making a large section of the media its footsteps, the government has already manipulated the traditional fabric of the Indian state to a great extent, maintaining a balance of control and balance between its various pillars
 misaal dekhen: 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaavon ke liye prachaar ke dauraan apane bhaashanon main pradhanmantri ne bahusankhyak-alpsankhyak dhruvikaran sthapit karne kii koshish kii or chunaav ayog aankh-kaan band kiye rahaa
 Then when a courageous member of the Commission expressed his intention to allow this constitutional body to function in an independent and impartial manner, he was immediately targeted
 so, naukarshahi or yahaan tak ki nyaaypalika ko bhi ishaara saaf he—hamaare ishaaron par chalem varanaa keemat bhugatne ko taiyaar rahen
 Not surprisingly, the Supreme Court has not shown readiness to raise the issue of long-standing violation of democratic rights of common people and their political representatives in Kashmir, following the political motives of the government
 aakhir sangh parivaar ganatantr 2
 Why does 0 want? Because he republic 1
 0 kii rachana main koi ahm bhoomika nahin nibhaai thi
 He has very few heroes in that era
 yahi vajah he ki vah sardaar patel or mahatma gandhi tak ko apni dhara main samahit kar lenaa chahta he (haalanki gandhi ke saath aisa kar paanaa uske liye bahut mushkil prathit ho rahaa he)
 That's why that republic 1
 0 ke itihaas ko jhuthalane kii besharm koshishen kar rahaa he or congress ko uske nayak kii jagah khalanaayak ke taur par pesh kar rahaa he
 Home Minister Amit Shah's misconception in the Lok Sabha that the Congress is responsible for the partition of the country on the basis of religion - is not just a statement given
 uskaa makasad yah he ki bhaajapa ke bharat ke apane dharm aadhaarit dhruvikaran ko vaidhaniktaa pradaan kar di jaae
 Its sly appeal to the Hindu community is clear — India's struggle against English rule is now history, but the struggle against the real 'other' people — that is, Muslims who accepted Islam during the much longer Muslim rule — until then Must continue until Hindu sovereignty is fully established
 yahi he jise sangh parivaar 1947 se pehle bhi hasil karnaa chahta tha—samoochaa 'akhand bharat' ek 'hindu raashtra' main tabdeel ho jaae—lekin vah ho na sakaa
 Even after seven decades, this ambition has not changed
 hindu dharm kaa raajnneetikaran or hindutv kii buniyaad par ek nae ganatantr kii imaarat kii rachana bahudharmee bharat ko khaasi chot pahunchaayegi
 Recently, in Lahore, i met the famous Pakistani academician F
 es
 Was from Ejazuddin
 unke chetavanee bhare alfaaz ab bhi kaanon main gunj rahe hai, ''ham pakistaniyon ne badi keemat chukaai he—hinsak sangharsh, sampradayawad, ugravad, ashishnutaa or adhikaron va aazaadee ke hanan ke rup main—kyonki hamane apane rajya or samaaj kaa islamickaran ho jane diya
 Now if India wants to repeat the same mistake by giving Hinduization a waiver, it is her wish
 lekin yaad rakhiegaa ki bharat ko isaki hamase bhi kahin zyada keemat chukaani padegi

 raghav ji kii kathith sex sidi aane ke baad hi logon kii jubaan par un tamaam netaaon ke naam aane lage hai, jinaki kathith sex sidi saamne ai or phir unka rajnatik kariyar tabah ho gaya
 In this list, there is also a Khanty politician like ND Tiwari, then a leader like Mahipal Maderna, who became as famous as himself, his CD partner Bhanwari Devi
 ye bhi digar he ki isi sidi ke pher main bhavari kii hatya bhi ho gai
 Abhishek Manu Singhvi's career in Congress ended by a CD
 sangh ke jariye bijepi ke sheersh tak pahunche sanjay joshi ko bhi ek sidi ke chalate hi thaharnaa padaa
 Let's have a look at some popular political sex CD scandal: April 2012: Singh was promising a judge, the career of Congress spokesperson and MP Abhishek Manu Singhvi, son of Lakshmimal Singhvi, one of the senior most lawyers in the sex country, was ruined by a CD
 
 ye kathith sex sidi unke hi ek karmchaaree ne khunnas main aakar cabin main record kii thi
 This alleged CD shows Singhvi having sex with a female lawyer
 sidi kaa shuruaati dialog he ki jab kab bana rahe ho
 As soon as the CD came to notice, a debate started in the country about what kind of favors are given for making judges
 singhvi ko pravaktaa samet sabhi sansadeey samitiyon se istipha dena padaa or lambey vakt tak vah party main kinare rahe
 At the moment, he is back as the spokesperson
 may 2012: mahipal maderna-bhavari devi kii sex sidibhanwari devi rajasthan main mid wif yani nurse thi
 Then she came in contact with MLA Malkhan Singh Bishnoi and Minister Mahipal Maderna
 antarangta panpi
 Meanwhile, Bhanwari is believed to have prepared a sex CD with Maderna
 kaha jaataa he ki apane kaam karwaane ke liye bhavari maderna ko isi kathith sidi ke dam par dhamkaaya karti thi
 According to the CBI, MLA Malkhan's sister Indira murdered her due to this
 maamle kii sibiai jaanch chal rahi he
 Maderna was an emerging Jat leader of the Gehlot government, who had a strong father's legacy
 magar is prakaran ke baad unhen istipha dena padaa or philhal unka kariyar thama hua he
 December 2009: ND Tiwari ND Tiwari doing colors at Raj Bhavan
 congress ke kaddavar netaa
 After Rajiv, he was a contender for the post of PM
 magar chunaav nahin jeet paae, to daavedaari kya khaak karte
 Was the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh
 phir uttarakhand bana to uske bhi siem rahe
 But people remember ND for flattering Sanjay Gandhi or for his colorful mood
 tiwari andhra pradesh ke governor the, jab ek kathith sex sidi relies hui, jisamen vah do mahilaon ke saath najar aae
 a ruckus arose, even after Nanukur, the Congress high command drove him
 iske baad tiwari ne phir surkhiyaan banaain, jab purv kendriya mantri sher singh kii beti ujjwala ne clem kiya ki unke bete rohit shekhar ke pita endi hai
 This matter was decided after reaching the court
 endi kii chuppi kaam nahin ai or medical report se sabit hua ki vahi rohit ke pita hai
 Talking about political career, after the colors of Raj Bhavan, he stopped getting expressions
 uttarakhand chunaavon ke dauraan kuch puchakaara gaya, magar phir kinare kar die gaye
 May 2005: CD Sanjay Joshi of Sanjay Joshi who came before the party session was once the face of the Sangh in BJP
 unke paas pad tha sanghathan mahasachiv kaa
 Joshi was rapidly climbing the stairs of the power order and this was knocking his opponents
 inamen narendra modi kaa naam sabase upar liya jaataa he
 However, after the party lost power, a session was to be held in Mumbai, before which an alleged sex CD was revealed
 isamen sanjay joshi sa dikhne vaala aadmi kisi mahila ke saath sambhogarat tha
 a ruckus ensued as soon as the CD arrived and Joshi had to resign
 kahaan gaya ki raajnneeti ne unhen thikaane laga diya
 Joshi then returned to the organization under Gadkari Raj
 uttar pradesh chunaavon se pehle unhen vahaan party kaa prabharee mahasachiv bhi banaaya gaya
 But last year, before the Mumbai session, Narendra Modi was adamant
 unhone kaha ki joshi ko hataao tabhi shaamil hounga
 Due to this Sangh's favorite Sanjay Joshi has again gone on political exile
 saal 2012 main ritesh batra ne film lanchbox ke jariye chitthiyon se panpi do ajanabiyon kii prem kahani ko bayaan kiya tha
 The era was when the aged middle class people of the country were not very comfortable with facilities like email and SMS
 rahul bose kii kamaal kii film "da japanese wif" main bhi kuch aisa hi concept tha
 After 7 years, when things like social media are becoming common for a section of India, when every other person wants to be a star by opening their channel on youtube and putting in the pictures of Instagram by capturing the dream of becoming a mini celebrity, such In an emergency phase, Ritesh once again takes the audience back a few years
 unke nirdesan main bani photograph aapako thodaa thaharne or zindagi kii choti chizon main khushiyaan dhundne ke liye prerit karti he
 Rafi (nawazuddin Siddiqui) from Uttar Pradesh is in debt
 apni sthiti ko behatar banane ke liye getwe of india par logon kii tasviren khinchataa he
 Like a salesman, he does a breathtaking marketing of words to capture people, and one day he runs into Mimony (sanya Malhotra)
 vah kahata he -"aap saalon baad jab ye photo dekhengi, tab aapako aapke chehre par yahi dhoop dikhaai degi
 This air in your hair and the voices of thousands of people in your ears will be gone forever
 "mimony, mumbai main middle class gujarati ladki he
 Absolutely straightforward, a girl who pays attention to studies and stays away from love
 lekin rafee kaa ye dialog sunakar vah thithak jaati he
 She gets the photo taken, but is unable to pay it
 vahiin rafee kii daadi apane pote ko ghar basaate hue dekhnaa chaahati he
 She is so behind Rafi that she does not take medicines and even blackmails her
 apni daadi ko tarakaane ke liye rafee kahata he ki use mumbai main ek ladki mil chuki he
 Encouraged by this, Grandma reaches Mumbai
 ab ladki kii talash main rafee ek baar phir mimony ko khojataa he
 How Mimoni Rafi meets and what happens in the story, will have to go to see the film
 ritesh batra ko vaastavik or relateble kirdaaron ko likhane main maharath hasil he
 They present the meeting of two mismatches in a beautiful style in their familiar style
 film kii raftaar kuch logon ko kaaphi besabr kar sakati he
 Because both the main characters of the film do not appear in any dramatic way even in scenes filled with emotional upheaval
 in kirdaaron ko kahin bahut jaldi jane, pahunchane, apane man kaa gubaar nikaalane kii tadap yaa astitvvaadi sawaalon kii jhunjhalaahat jaisi samasya nahin he
 These characters behave only by staying within their class and scope
 aise main bollywood kii menstream filmon ke aadi ho chuke kuch logon ko film behad dhimi lag sakati he
 Some elements of the film are reminiscent of Sophia Coppola's film "lost in Translation", which featured the journey of a mismatched duo without a cloak and drama 
 film main yun to gane nahin hai, lekin 60-70 ke dashak ke retro sadabahaar gane film main ek kirdaar kii tarah prabhavi nazar aate hai
 The scenes in which the song "you Saw Me" and "noori" are used reveal Ritesh's ability to direct
 christopher nolan kii filmon kaa climex pechida or aspasht hota he, lekin ritesh behad saadhaaran subject or kam jatil kirdaaron ke saath bhi film ke climex main aisi sanshayatmak sthiti creat kar jate hai ki darshakon ko nirdeshak kii riting kii jagah apane paracepshan par nirbhar hona padataa he
 Although the writing of the film could have been a bit better
 ye film lanchbox kii tivrata or uske str se thodaa peeche rah jaati he
 It is nice to see Nawaz in this role just after Balasaheb Thackeray's role
 navazuddin ritesh kii film lanchbox main bhi ek saadhaaran middleclass insaan ke rup main nazar aae the
 That role is considered one of the best roles of his filmography
 haalanki is kirdaar main unki pichhali kai menstream rolls jaisaa chatakilaapan nahin he
 But in debt and with all manner of problems in his heart, Rafi speaks his words with a little dialogue and nonchalant style
 sanya shuruyaat main navaj ke saamne anderple karti huin lagati he
 But as the film progresses, they become comfortable
 agar unke role ko thodaa or behatar likhaa jaataa to ye sanya kaa sabase yaadgaar kairactor ho saktaa tha
 Vijay Raj is covered in his small cameo
 vahiin navaj kii daadi (farrukh jafar) jab-jab screen par aati hai, apane dialogs se maahaul bana detii hai
 Nawaz's dialogues with his grandmother are excellent
 film main gym sarab kaa chemiyo bhi acha he
 This is an important film to watch Nawazuddin Siddiqui's acting and Ritesh Batra's detailing about Mumbai
 realistak middle class kirdaaron kii ek anuthi prem kahani dekhnaa chaahate hai to ye film aapke liye he
 But if you like masala movies, you can still go to see this movie

 jiesti council kii baithak ke baad vittamantri arun jetali ne saaf taur par kaha ki jiesti ke tahat sarkaar ke rajasav main jo kami ai he, usase ek baat to saaf he ki bahut se log jiesti kaa nazaij phayda uthaa rahe hai
 Now people who steal tax will be banned
 guuruuvaar ko jiesti council kii 25veen baithak main jin chizon par tex kam karne kaa faisla kiya gaya, unamem puraani car, 20 litre kii pani kii bottle, baio dijal se chalane vaali bas, sinchai main kaam aane vaali mashine, kai tarah kii scientific mashine, tamaam tarah ke kitnashak, mehandi powder, hathkargha kii bani tamaam chijen, velvet kaa kapadaa, hira or keemtee pathar shaamil he
 In the GST Council meeting held just before the budget, GST on 29 items and 53 services was reduced to zero percent
 rice bran aayal ekmaatr aisi cheez he, jiske upar jiesti jiro se badhaakar paanch fisadi kiya gaya he yani yah tel ab mahangaa ho jayega
 At the same time, the old car buyers will now get a big relief, because GST has been reduced from 28 percent to 12 percent
 badi car or esayuvi bhi agar aap puraani kharidte hai, to ab 28 pratishat kii bajaay aapako sirf 18 pratishat tex dena hoga
 Apart from this, the Modi government has also given the gift of winning in Gujarat elections to the diamond traders of Gujarat
 hira or keemtee pattharon par jiesti ab teen pratishat se ghataakar sirf 0
 Has been reduced to 25 percent
 iske saath hijistiform bharne main vyapaariyon kii dikkaton ko aasaan karne ke liye sarkaar thos kadam uthaane ja rahi he
 Soon the government will make such a system that traders have to fill only one form instead of three GST forms, but it will take some time for this decision to be implemented
 sarkaar ne upabhoktaaon or vyapaariyon ko raahat dene ke saath hi yah bhi sanket die hai ki ab jiesti kii aad main tex chori karne waalon par sakhti kii jaaegi
 After the GST Council meeting, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley clearly said that one thing is clear from the decrease in the revenue of the government under GST, that many people are taking advantage of GST illegally
 unhone kaha ki khaas taur par chote vyapaariyon ke liye laai gai compojishan skim kaa khub durupyog ho rahaa he
 It is clear from this that 17 lakh traders who have registered under the composition scheme have paid only 307 crores tax
 compojishan skim un vyapaariyon ke liye he, jinka salanaa kaarobaar dedh karod rupee se kam he
 Those who register under this scheme have to pay only one percent tax
 jetali ne saaf kiya ki aisa lagata he ki bahut se bade vyapaaree bhi compojishan skim main galat tareeke se aakar kam tex de rahe hai
 Jaitley said that now people who steal tax will be banned

 ) Crude oil prices have been steadily decreasing in the international market and now 78
 92 america dollar prati bairal (153 litre) par aa gai he
 According to the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, the international price of crude oil was 78 on November 12
 92 dollar prati bairal ho gai jabaki ek din pehle yani 11 november ko isaki keemten 79
 Was 11 dollars
 rupee ke sandarbh main 12 november ko yah 4852
 00 per barrel, while on November 11 it was 4869
 22 rupee prati bairal thi
 On the other hand, the rupee strengthened to 61 on Wednesday
 48 rupee prati america dollar par band hua
 In the month of June this year, the price of Brent crude oil was raised to $ 115 per barrel and experts were anticipating prices to rise further
 haalanki kuch visheshgy yah bhi kah rahe the ki kachche tel kii keemten apane ucchtam str par aa chuki hai or yahaan se keemten kam hona shuru hongi, or ye bhavishyavaanee sach sabit hoti dikh rahi he
 Its prices rose to $ 95 per barrel in early October and now these prices have come down after breaking the $ 80 barrier
 kyon gire kachche tel ke daam2013 ke madhya se hi tel kii keemton ke girane kaa anumaan lagaaya ja rahaa tha
 The reasoning behind this was working that the market had more supply than demand
 iske peeche teen vajahen thim
 The first reason is the lifting of economic sanctions from Iran
 america pratibandh se iran kii aarthik sthiti danvadol ho gai or pratibandh hatane ke baad uski sabase badi jarurat nakadi ko badhaane kii thi
 Here Iran opened up its oil reserve as much as possible
 nateeja, antarrashtriya bazaar main kachche tel kii bahulata or isaki keemton main anumaan se zyada kami kaa hona
 On the other hand, three years ago during the fall of Gaddafi, Libya suffered a great loss of its oil resources which has now improved and its exports have returned
 iran kii hi tarah libya ko bhi nakadi kii aavashyaktaa he or iske liye wo keemton kii parvaah kiye bagaiyr adhik se adhik kachche tel ke niryaat par dhyaan de rahaa he
 The third biggest reason is the US, which is now importing less crude oil
 2005 tak america ko apni khapat kaa 60 fisadi kaccha tel antarrashtriya bazaar se khareednaa padataa tho jo ab ghatakar 30 fisadi par aa gaya he
 This means more oil is already available in the market
 haalanki america main kachche tel ke khanan main badhotaree kii to sambhaavna jataai gai thi lekin is saal antarrashtriya str par kachche tel kii keemton main ai itani kami kii kisi visheshgy ne sambhaavna nahin jataai thi
 Overall, these are the three major factors that have led to a steady decline in crude oil prices
 petrol, dijal kii keemton main or hongi katauteeisase pehle bhi petrol-dijal kii keemton main lagaataar giravat hoti rahi he or ab tak inamen 10 se 13 fisadi tak kii kami aa chuki he
 9 so far in petrol prices due to continuously decreasing crude oil prices in the international market
 36 rupee kii kami aa chuki he, yahi haal dijal kaa bhi he
 Since deregulation on October 21 this year, its prices have also steadily decreased
 antarrashtriya bazaar main kachche tel kii keemton main lagaataar giravat kaa sidhaa asar bhartiya bazaaron par padaa or isaki vajah se bhartiya tel companiyon par dabaav kam hua or ve daam ghataane kii taiyaari main hai
 This means that the prices of petrol and diesel are again likely to decrease

 This audio is being told about a conversation between policemen

 gauratlab he ki bhopal central jail se bhaage simi ke aath vichaaradhin aatankwaadiyon ne jail todane ke baad kul aath ghante main sirf das kilometre kii duuri tay kii thi
 That is, he was in no hurry to escape after leaving prison
 sabase ahm baat ye ki ye das kilometre kii duuri bhi unhone paidal chalate hue do se teen ghante main hi puri kar lee thi
 This was the statement of the police on the encounter
 At three o'clock in the morning, inside the jail, the jail administration received news that eight terrorists belonging to SIMI had escaped from the jail
 bhaagane se pehle ek head consteble kaa galaa bhi kaat daalaa
 The teams of Bhopal Local Police, CTG and STF stack up eight terrorists who had escaped from jail just eight hours earlier
 is encounter ke baad bhopal police ek chaunkaane vaala bayaan diya
 According to police, all eight terrorists were killed during self-defense
 kyonki police team ko dekhte hi unhone police par goliyaan chalaani shuru kar di thim
 The matter of arms is serious
 Now the question is that eight terrorists who escaped from the prison were killed in the encounter
 phir jail se baahar nikalate hi agle aath ghante ke dauraan unke paas hathiyaar kahaan se aa gaye? kya hathiyaaron kaa intjaam unhone pehle se kar rakhaa tha? hathiyaar wo jail se hi lekar aae the? kyonki agar jail main hi unke paas hathiyaar hote to wo head consteble kaa galaa kaatane ke liye steel kii plate yaa gilaas katkar dhardhar hathiyaar nahin banaate
 That is, if he had a weapon, he got it outside the jail
 lekin hathiyaar unhen jail se baahar aate hi kisne diya?pahari se aage koi rasta nahin thaintakhedi main jis pahari ke kareeb ye encounter hua vahaan se aage koi rasta hi nahin jaataa
 From here you can only jump and go down and jumping from the hill means death directly
 ab sawaal ye he ki jail se bhagane ke baad shahar chhodane kii bajaae aathon aatankwaadi ek ded and jagah par rukkar police kaa intjaar kyon kar rahe the?alag-alag baiyrakon main band the aatankibain sanghathan simi yani student islamic movement of india kii chaatr ikai se jude yahi wo aathon aatankwaadi hai jo police encounter main maare gaye
 These eight were bomb blasts in many cities of the country and other serious charges
 maamla abhi adaalat main chal rahaa he
 Thus, all eight were held in high security Bhopal Central Jail as undertrials
 jail ke andar aathon ek saath nahin the
 Rather they were kept in separate barracks
 jail prashasan ke mutabik ye aathon diwaali vaali raat kareeb 12 baje se do baje ke darmyaan jail se bhaage the
 Terrorists escaped from such jails, the administration says that the eight crossed the twenty feet high wall of the jail by making blankets and sheets of rope to escape from the jail
 bhaagane ke dauraan unhone ek head consteble kii galaa ret k hatya kar di
 The question is how to make a wall twenty feet high by making a blanket and a rope of rope at the other end
 bhopal central jail se jo aath aatankwaadi bhaage or phir encounter main mare gaye unamem se teen 2013 main madhya pradesh ke hi khandwa jail se bhi faraar ho chuke the
 However, he was caught again within 12 hours
 usee haadase ke baad se simi se jude zyaadaatar aatankwaadiyon ko bhopal central jail shift kar diya gaya tha

 priyanka gandhi purvi uttar pradesh kii jikvamedaari sanbhaalengi
 With this, the State Congress office at Mall Avenue in Lucknow was decorated for Priyanka's reception
 pradesh adhyaksh ke nae karyaalay se sate ek band pade bade kamare ko taiyaar karne main sabase zyada dhyaan lagaaya ja rahaa he
 In the same room, before the 2017 assembly elections, the team of election strategist and now Janata Dal United leader Prashant Kishore used to sit
 isi sabase bade kamare ko priyanka ke sachivalay ke rup main dhaala ja rahaa he
 Priyanka Gandhi's entry into politics is part of Rahul Gandhi's plan to revive the Congress
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main party kii haar ke baad se hi rahul gandhi sanket de rahe the ki party ke dobaaraa khadey hone kii raah un rajyon se hokar guzarati he jahaan loksabhaa kii adhik siten hai
 For example, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra
 iske liye sabase pehali jarurat he sanghathan ko majboot karne kii, jo ki lambey vakt kaa kaam he
 Rahul Gandhi was waiting for victory, working on a slow but solid strategy for change in the organization
 bagaiyr kamyaabi hasil kiye priyanka kii entry ko rahul ke netritv kii vifaltaa or party kii ore se isaki sweekaarokti ke rup main dekha jaataa
 So, after the recent Congress victory in three Hindi speaking states, Priyanka's entry into the organization got a suitable chance
 unki niyukti ke baad rahul ne patrakaron se baatcheet main kaha ki unka kaam lambey samay ke liye he na ki sirf 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main party ke liye siten jeetna
 a Congress Rajya Sabha MP says, "without a strong 80-seat Uttar Pradesh, no party can think of ruling in India
" priyanka yuva, aakarshak vyaktitv kii dhani or tarotaaja cheharaa hai
 He is expected to win in UP in the long run
 ve congress ko phir majboot karne kii yojana kaa hissaa hai
 "rahul insists on strengthening the party in the states and believes that the same strategy is not effective for every state
" yahi vajah he ki party uttar pradesh main samaajawaadee party (sapa) or bahujan samaaj party (basapa) ke gathbandhan main shaamil nahin hui
 However, Rahul Gandhi is a strong advocate of united opposition against Modi and BJP in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections at the national level
 congress ke bahut saare jamini kaaryakarta pehle hi rahul se kah chuke the ki sapa-basapa gathbandhan main 10 siton ke saath junior partner banane se party ko baari nuksaan hoga
 By the way, Rahul did not want to hurt the alliance that had the power to harm the BJP
 aise main congress ko aise netaa kii talash thi jo na keval kaaryakartaaon main urja bhar de balki bhagava party se naaraaz or sapa-basapa ko vot dene ke anicchhuk logon ko ekajute kar sake
 There is no one better than Priyanka for this job
 rahul kaa kahana he, ''ham yathasambhav akhilesh yadav or mayawati ke saath milakar kaam karenge
 At the same time, we will establish the ideology of Congress and this step is very important in this direction
 ''shaayad isi raajnneetik sameekaran ke hisaab se jyotiraditya sindhiya ko pashchimi uttar pradesh kaa mahasachiv tainaat kiya gaya he
 Scindia is sent to attract the Thakur votes of the state while Priyanka is pushed forward to draw Brahmin voters to her side
 haalanki sindhiya nijee baatcheet main daawa karte hai ki ve pichde varg se aate hai
 However, the dilemma still remains before the party whether to remain aggressive or soft against the SP-BSP alliance, keeping in mind the equation that is formed after the Lok Sabha elections
 congress ke rashtriya mahasachiv gulam nabi aajad kehete hai, ''upi main congress puri takat ke saath sabhi loksabhaa siton par chunaav ladegi
 There is no question of being soft on opponents

 Shivpal says, "congress is a secular party
 bhaajapa ko haraane ke liye ham congress kaa samarthan kar sakate hai
 "the biggest challenge before the Congress, which has garnered huge support from farmers in the assembly elections of Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan, is also to address the farmers of Uttar Pradesh
" party kii sanghathanaatmak udaseenta kaa alam yah he ki pradesh main pichley saat varshon se bhang kisaan vibhaag kaa gathan ab tak nahin ho paaya he

 iske baad nirmal khatri pradesh congress adhyaksh bane or ab raaj babbar ke haathon upi main party kii kaman he, lekin kisaan vibhaag ko behaal karne kii sud kisi ne nahin lee
 Congress's national media panelist Surendra Rajput says, "there is no farmer-friendly leader in the entire country than Congress national president Rahul Gandhi
" priyanka ji rahul gandhi or kisaanon ke bich bakhubi link kaa kaam karengi
 "the Congress is once again planning Rahul Gandhi's farmer rallies in Uttar Pradesh before the Lok Sabha elections

 He will be cremated in the capital Raipur on Wednesday afternoon

 Shukla's body has reached Raipur by special plane
 buudhvaar subah unka parthiv sharir congress bhawan main antim darshan ke liye rakhaa gaya
 After this, his last visit and at four o'clock in the evening will be done in his farm house as per his wish only on the platform made by him

 Vidyacharan Shukla, by whose name Chhattisgarh came to be known

 The 86-year-old political youth had so much power that he had also embarked on the party's Parivartan Yatra that day, knowing that there could be threats to him in an area like Sukma

 jab unke nidhan kii khabar mili to chhattisgarh kaa jarra-jarra ro padaa
 Read the story of Sanjay Gandhi's 'censor' Vidyacharan Shukla, living in the climate of Chhattisgarh, he did many things for the development of Chhattisgarh
 vidya bhaiyya ne sabase pehle raipur main tivi laayaa tha
 How can anyone forget them? unke nidhan se congress or aamajan, sab asahaay
 There was a time when Vidya Bhaiya was upset with the policies of the Congress and moved to the Nationalist Congress Party, then to the BJP
 magar unka dil to jaise congress main hi basaa hua tha
 The leader who followed the footsteps of his father and elder brother, how would it have been that he would have stayed away from the Congress
 isliye vidya bhaiya waapas congress main aa gaye
 He had differences with many opposition leaders, but there was no discrimination
 yahi vajah he ki raajnneetik dooriyaan bani raheen, magar vyaktigat lagaav bana hi rahaa
 Vidya Bhaiya was the pillar of strength of Congress in Chhattisgarh
 unki vajah se desh main chhattisgarh kii pahchaan he
 When talking about Chhattisgarh, outsiders used to say that the same Chhattisgarh is from VC Shukla

 This will greatly increase their cost to produce per liter of petrol
 isse desh main ekbar phir petrol or dijal kii keemten badhanaa shuru ho sakati hai

 upi sarkaar bhale hi shikshak paatrata pariksha (TET) paas bied waalon ko prashikshu sahaayak adhyaaapak banane kii prakriya shuru kar chuki ho, lekin inke prashikshan par hi sankat kii naubat aa gai he
 The situation is that there is a huge shortage in the District Education and Training Institute (DIET), which trains teachers, from principal to spokesperson
 uttar pradesh lok seva ayog ko khaali padon kaa byora dene ke baad bhi abhi tak bhartee prakriya puri nahin ho saki he
 In such a situation, lack of spokespersons in DIET may cause crisis in the training of newly recruited 1
25 lakh assistant teachers
 dit kaa mukhya kaam beatisi prashikshan dene ke saath basic shiksha parishad ke skulon main bhartee hone vaale prashikshu shikshakon ko prashikshan dena he
 It is headed by the principal
 praachaarya kaa pad up shiksha nideshak, up praachaarya kaa diioes or varisht pravaktaa kaa pad biese str ke adhikari ke baraabar hota he
 Apart from this, the post of work experience teacher, technical teacher and statistician is similar to LT grade teacher
 pradesh main maujuuda samay 70 jilon main dit hai
 Of these, 1960 posts are approved, out of which 915 posts are vacant
 sabase kharaab sthiti varisht pravaktaa or pravaktaa padon kii he
 Presently, the process of recruitment of 72,825 trainees in primary schools and 29,334 teachers of mathematics and science in higher primary is going on
 basic shiksha vibhaag in prashikshu shikshakon ko prashikshan ke baad hi purnakalik shikshak kaa darja degaa isliye inhen chah maah ke prashikshan ke liye dit main bheja jayega, jahaan teen maah kaa kriyaatmak or teen maah kaa prayogtmak prashikshan hoga
 Experimental training will be in schools, so there will not be any problem, but functional training is to be done in DIET so shortage of teachers can cause problems there

 Former Finance Minister P
K
 chidambaram ne bhi notebandi ke faisle par gambhir sawaal khadey kiye
 He claimed that a cabinet meeting was not called to seal the ban on demonetisation
 chidambaram ke mutabik sarkaar ke mantriyon ko tab tak kaidiyon kii tarah band rakhaa gaya jab tak piem ne is faisle kaa elaan nahin kiya
 Chidambaram's allegations: The Modi government has converted the RBI into a 'small department'
 -rigerv bank par notebandi kaa faisla thopa gaya
 - In the meeting where the RBI approved the decision, only two of the three directors of the bank were present
 -notebandi se jidipi dar 2 fisadi tak gir sakati he
 a 1 per cent fall in this rate means 1
 5 lakh karod kaa nuksaan-notebandi se rojgaar or vetan kam honge-is faisle se automobile or textyle sector par vipareet asar-80 fisadi chote or madhyam darje ke udyog band hone kaa khatra How long has it been when your friend promised that he will give you a collection of your favorite songs by bringing you to the pen drive? Something similar happened for those photos which were captured in your friend's camera
 na pen-drive aayaa, na gane mili, na photo! email par ikkaa-dukka photo to usne bheji bhi thim shaayad, par jane wo kahaan gayin
 After all, who can handle the attachments of emails
 pen drive he jhanjhat kaa namis kamabakht 'pen drive' ke saath yahi musiibat he
 People often forget to promise
 yaa phir, bhul jane kaa bahaanaa kar dete hai
 Because what the pen drive takes, it forgets to return
 jis pen drive ko aap bahut sambhaal kar rakhte hai, wo jane kaise gum ho jaataa he
 What is not lost, does not know where it is hidden that does not get on the spot! But the most anger comes when you see that the important file saved inside the pen drive refuses to open at the last moment
 jab aap koshish kar ke haar jate hai tab pataa chalata he ki file 'karpt' ho chuki he - yani file is tarah kharaab hui he ki ab hameshaa ke liye gayi
 Virus free with songs, you know that pen drive is the biggest way to spread virus in computer
 dost kaa pen drive aapane laptop main lagaaya nahin ki gaanon or photo ke saath virus muft main mil gaye
 Now do the investigation with anti-voice
 agar aap kisi baari suraksha vaali sarkari building main gaye honge to aapako pataa hi hoga ki get par suraksha jaanch ke samay bag main padaa pen drive kitni badi musiibat ban jaataa he
 How many times you must have felt that there was a way that even big files would be able to send someone at once, in the same way as sending emails
 koi aisa tarika, jisase pen drive, memory card, lene-dene kaa chakkar hi khatm ho jaae
 There is no risk of virus, fear of missing nor tension of file corruption
 jaruri filon kaa byaap, data kii securiticchhloud storage (cloud storage) kaa istemaal karke aap badi se badi file, bina atachament vaali email kii tarah kisi ko aasaani se bhej sakate hai
 Not only this, your file is also protected forever - a very reliable back-up copy of it is generated
 iske baad aapkaa pen drive, memory card to kya, puraa phone, computer bhi gum ho jaae, kharaab ho jaae, achaanak formet-riset karnaa pade, tab bhi aapkaa data (data) kahin nahin jayega
 Photos, songs, documents, video clips - all of them, will be in front of you again in a few minutes
 aapkaa data 'cloud' main hone kaa ye bhi matlab he ki aap internet se conected kisi bhi compauter yaa mobile par log in karke apni file paa sakate hai
 There is no need to carry your laptop everywhere
 email se bhi asancloud storaj kaa naam to zyaadaatar logon ne suna he, par jane kyon, raat din email par jeene vaale bhi bahut se log iskaa istemaal nahin karte
 Cloud storage means that your data, other than your phone, your phone and computer, is present somewhere else on a company's computer, along with your user name and password
 ise remote sarwar bhi kehete hai
 Whenever you want, you can access your data on the remote server with the help of internet, make any changes, share it with someone or delete it forever
 thik usee tarah jaise aap kisi bhi computer par log in karke apana mail check karte hai
 It is free, just like service email, all companies offer cloud storage to some extent for free
 agar aapako zyada data rakhana he to salaana kuch fees dekar aap jitani chaahe spes kharid sakate hai
 But even for free, you can gain so much space on cloud storage that you can keep your important documents, music collections, many photos
 cloud storage par rakhi hui kisi bhi file ko share karne ke liye na to pen drive kii jarurat he, na hi memory card kii
 The hassle of taking a pen drive is over and a backup of your data is ready with you all the time
 kisi bhi computer par apni tamaam photo, jab chaahe dekho
 Anytime, enjoy your selection of selected songs
 bas itnaa dhyaan rahelekin cloud storaj kaa or gungan karne se pehle ham aapako isaki kuch kamiyon ke bare main bhi bataa den
 You can understand that it is necessary to have an internet connection to get something placed on cloud storage on another computer or mobile
 iske bagaiyr aap apane phone yaa compauter par to use dekh sakate hai lekin kisi ko bhej nahin sakate
 If the Internet is slow, uploading and downloading large files (especially videos) becomes extremely boring
 or ye baat bhi aapako yaad rakhni hogi ki badi files ko cloud par aplod karnaa or downlod karnaa internet kaa bill badhaata he
 But if you have a fast speed internet connection (like wi-fi or 3G), and you are using an unlimited data plan, then you can enjoy the cloud service openly
 duusari ganth baandh lene kii baat ye hi ki koi bhi company, kuch bhi daawa kare - sachai ye he ki jo kuch bhi internet par daalaa gaya he wo sabakuch hack ho saktaa he - yani galat logon ke haath main pahunch saktaa he
 So, never put very confidential things - such as bank details, credit cards, passwords and very personal photos, videos - on the Internet
 agar koi cheez behad jaruri he, to uskaa ek or byaap kisi or jagah jarur rakhen
 Whatever you want, Chunokloud storage is very easy to use
 Dropbox (drapsbox), Google Drive (google drive), Sky Drive (ski drive), Sugar Sync (sugarasinc), Box (box) jaisi tamaam sarvice main se apni pasand kii koi bhi cloud sarvice chune
 Only once, download the small software of whatever cloud storage service you want to use in your computer or phone
 koun si cloud sarvice sabase acchhee he is bahes main zyada padane kii jarurat nahin he
 Everyone has their strengths and drawbacks
 or kisi ne aap par ye pabandi to lagaai nahin ki aap sirf ek hi cloud sarvice istemaal kar sakate hai
 If you want, you can use multiple cloud services simultaneously for different things
 jaise main drapsbox main apana mujeec kaa collection rakhata hum, google drive main photo kaa byaap rakhata hum or ski drive main apane video clips
 But you can start with Dropbox (dropbox) or Google Drive (google Drive) which are very popular and reliable
 Dropbox (dropbox) paane ke liye neeche die link par clic karen
 https: / / www
 dropbox
 com / downloading? src = click on the link below to get indexgoogle Drive (google Drive)
 https: / / tools
 google
 com / dlpage / drivebasa do minute chahipub apana ek yuzar nem or password bana len
 That's it, you're done
 aapke compauter par ab dropbox yaa google drive kaa ek iken ban gaya hoga
 For convenience, place this icon on the desktop, ie in front of the eye
 jis bhi file ko aap share karnaa chaahate hai usko bas uthaa kar iske bheetar daal den - copy karke yaa cat - paste karke
 According to the size of your file and the speed of your internet, this file will be synced in a few minutes - that is, this file has now gone to the cloud
 kehane kaa matlab ye kii ab aapke is file kii ek copy dropbox ke sarwar par bhi ban gayi he
 Once your file is uploaded to a remote server, ie Dropbox, sharing it is a left-handed game
 ab aap use puri file nahin, sirf ek link bhejenge
 And anyone who has this link will download it directly from Dropbox's computer
 he na aasaan tarika ? agar aap chahen to kisi duusare aadmi ko ye adhikaar bhi de sakate hai ki aapaki file main koi badlaav kar sake, usamen kuch jod sake, yaa hataa sake
 Like you are building a project and want to show your friend or teacher to get advice on it
 ab chutki main karo kuch bhi shairaisi tarah, agar aap, doston ke saath milakar gaanon kaa ek collection bananaa chaahate hai to apane mujeec foulder ko dropbox main daal den 
 Then dropbox
 com par jaaen jo aapako dropbox ke foulder ke bheetar hi dikh jayega
 dropbox
 com par jate hi aapako apane sabhi foulder dikhengen 
 Right click on the folder you want to share
 aapako tamaam opshans dikhengen
 If you choose the option of Invite to folder and share it with friends, then they can also change it
 agar aap sirf share link karengen to aapke dost us file ko downlod to kar sakate hai, lekin usamen kuch badlaav nahin kar sakate
 You can use the other options you see by right clicking on the folder, according to your need
 jahaan chaaho vahaan paao apana dataklauda sarvice ko istemaal karne kaa majaa tab or batch jaataa he jab aapaki har file, har photo, mujeec - un tamaam compauter, phone, tablet par par maujuud rahe jo aap roj istemaal karte hai 
 For this, download Dropbox (or Google Drive, or whatever cloud service you are using) on every device
 lekin log in karne ke liye apana vahi yujaranem or password istemaal karen jo aapane pehali baar banaaya tha
 Now every file of your work is present everywhere
 aap agar kisi file main kuch badlaav karte hai - to wo duusari jagah khud ba khud badla hua dikhegaa
 Is it not a pen drive holiday? Use a pen drive now only if the file you want to send is too big - like a whole movie
 kyonki bahut badi file ko cloud par daalane main samay zyada lagegaa or internet muft yaa analimited plan nahin he to aapkaa bill zyada bad saktaa he
 But with whom to share the file, what would he do if he lives in another city? The choice is yours, if you want to put the file in a pen drive, send it to courier or come to the cloud service

 kya congress lalu kii argedy se gathbandhan todna chaahati he? kya congress bihar main nayaa saathi talash rahi he? kya lalu se gathbandhan fail hone ke baad ab congress jediu par daanv lagaana chaahati he? raajnneetik halkon main ye charchaa tej ho chuki he ki bihar main congress ab lalu se chhutkaaraa chaahati he
 Recently, this issue was overshadowed in a meeting called to review the defeat at Sadaqat Ashram, Bihar Congress headquarters
 4 june ko patna ke sadakat ashram main sanghathan ke 20 mahatvapurn logon ko bulaayaa gaya tha
 Among those who attended this meeting were AICC secretaries Kishori Lal Sharma and Paresh Dhanani, especially on behalf of the high command, in front of them all the leaders of Bihar advocated a split from Lalu Yadav at the earliest
 darasal, loksabhaa chunaav main gathbandhan main to argedy or congress ke bich acha talmail hua lekin isi dauraan vidhansabha ke 5 sthanon par hue upachunaav main lalu ne congress se koi samjhauta nahin kiya or sabhi 5 siton par apane ummidavaar utaar die
 Due to this attitude of Lalu, Tilamilai Congress also fielded candidates for 3 seats
 loksabhaa chunaav ke nateezon main bhi lalu haashie par jate dikhe
 Now Congress has started a new melody
 congress ko lagata he lalu yadav ke saath jaakar congress kabhi apane pairon par khadi nahin ho sakati or uskaa votbank lalu ke saath rahete, kabhi unke paas nahin laut saktaa
 Congress spokesperson and Congress candidate in Maharajganj assembly by-election Kuntal Kumar says, 'lalu Yadav has become a political burden for the Congress and the sooner this burden is discharged, the better it will be for the party
 'naa sirf loksabhaa chunaav main haare ummidavaar or yuva netaaon ne jald se jald lalu se gathbandhan todane kii vakaalat kii he balki dilli main lalu-sonia kii mulaakaat main bhi iske sanket lalu yadav ko de die gaye
 The larger section of the Congress is not ready to go with Lalu Yadav anymore
 pradesh congress adhyaksh ashok choudhary ne ajtak se kaha ki party main is vakt teen raay saamne he
 One section is in favor of the alliance with Lalu while the larger section is against it
