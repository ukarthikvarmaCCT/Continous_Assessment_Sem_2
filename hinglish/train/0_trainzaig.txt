 The strict Ministry of Home Affairs, which met the Italian intervention in the case of murder accused Navasik, has also said that it would not be a violation of the Vienna Agreement as it is not a step taken against any diplomat but a case of misleading the court
 grih mantralay kii is salaah or pradhanmantri ke kade rukh ke baad is baat kii ashanka bad gai he ki supreme court kii avmaananaa ke maamle main italy ke rajdoot ko giraftaar kiya ja saktaa he
 In this case, Harish Salve, who is fighting as a lawyer on behalf of Italy, has disassociated himself from the whole case, calling the Italian government's move unfortunate
 salve kaa kahana he ki chunki italy ke rajdoot ne khud bhartiya kanoon vyavastha kii prakriya main hissaa liya tha, isliye unhen is maamle main kanoonee karrwai se bachane ke liye rajanyik chhot nahin mil sakati he

 Paswan targeted BSP president Mayawati and said that if she is in power, she talks a few things and while in opposition, some
 do tarah kii baaten nahin kerani chahie
 While in power in 2007, Mayawati herself said that the SC / ST Act was misused
 esaspi ke jaanch baad hi SC / ST act lagaaya janaa chahie
 Now when the Supreme Court said the same thing, they are standing with opposing boys
 paswan ne kaha kimayawati 2007 main purna bahumatake saath satta main ain to unhone kaha ki dalit act ke kriyanvayan main saavdhaanee barti jaae
 Sometimes this act is misused at the behest of a domineering person
 aise main esaspi ke jaanch ke baad hi SC / ST act lagaaya janaa chahie
 Not only this, he had said on the rape case of a Dalit woman that the Act should be imposed after the medical report of the doctor
 supreme court ne jab yahi baat kahi to ve virodh main khadi hai
 Paswan said that Mayawati always talks like that
 andar kuch baahar kuch or satta main rahete hue kuch or vipaksh main kuch
 Paswan reminded Mayawati's old slogans of how her political slogans used to be different before coming to power and how her slogans changed after coming to power
 rafel vimaan saude main ghotaale kii gunj ke bich ab nayaa khulaasa hua he
 Aaj Tak has come to know that the Rafale deal during the Modi government is cheaper by Rs 59 crore per aircraft than the UPA government
 yani har rafel vimaan par modi sarkaar ne manmohan sarkaar kii tulana main 59 karod rupee bachaae
 According to the exclusive information received by Aaj Tak, the Modi government has saved the country's money in this special fighter aircraft deal and every aircraft deal has been made Rs 59 crore cheaper than the Congress government
 in dastavejon ke mutabik, modi sarkaar ne 36 vimaanon kaa jo sauda 59000 hajaar karod rupee main kiya he, usee tarah kii deal agar upie ke dauraan hui hoti to uski keemat 1
 69 lakh crores
 is hisaab se modi sarkaar ne ek vimaan kaa sauda 1646 karod rupee main kiya, jabaki upie main yah keemat 1705 karod rupee thi
 According to the airline, the aircraft that the Modi government has signed is said to be much more effective and technically more efficient than the aircraft being taken by the UPA government
 is vimaan ke andar METEOR or SCALP jaisi misile bhi hai, jo upie kii deal ke tahat liye ja rahe fiter vimaan main nahin thim
 It has also been revealed from the documents that in the aircraft that the Modi government has signed, 13 things have been increased specifically for India, which are not given to other countries
 haalanki, congress kaa aarope he ki is nai deal main kisi bhi tarah kii technology ke transfar kii baat nahin hui he
 Therefore, there is no understanding of sudden price rise
 congress kaa ghotaale kaa aropcongress rafel deal ko lekar lambey samay se modi sarkaar ke khilaaf aawaaj uthaa rahi he
 From road to Parliament and from press conferences to social media, Congress President Rahul Gandhi and his leaders have been accusing the Modi government of scam in the Rafael Deal
 congress kaa daawa he ki upie sarkaar ne jis vimaan kii deal kii thi, usee vimaan ko modi sarkaar teen guna keemat main kharid rahi he
 What is the claim of the Congress? Former Defense Minister AK Antony said that in December 2012, after talking to several companies, Rafael was selected and asked to take 126 aircraft
 modi sarkaar ne jis company ko ye deal di he uske paas naa hi aircraft banane kaa anubhav he or naa hi ladaaku aircraft kaa
 Due to this, many engineers of HAL also lost their jobs
 congress ne aarope lagaaya ki is nai deal main kisi bhi tarah kii technology ke transfar kii baat nahin hui he
 Former Defense Minister AK Antony said that as per the UPA government's deal, 18 out of 126 aircraft were to be built in France and the rest were to be built in India by HAL
 unhone kaha ki jab kisi tarah kii sikret deal hui hi nahin to phir sarkaar daam kyon nahin bataa rahi he?congress kaa ye bhi daawa he ki france ne bilkul aise hi aircraft misr or katar ko kam daam main beche hai, to phir bharat ke samay par daam adhik kaise ho gaye
 He said that in November 2016, the Defense Minister had told the prices of the aircraft, so why not now it is being told about it
 congress ke varisht netaa kishor chandra dev ne apni party kii maujuuda haalat ke sandarbh main kaha he ki agar rahul gandhi ne upaadhyaksh banane ke baad kiye gaye aadhe vaayadon ko bhi puraa karaayaa hota to congress kii yah durdasha nahin hoti
 Defeated in the Lok Sabha elections this time after being a five-time MP, outgoing Union Minister Dev asked party president Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi to introspect on this matter
 unhone kaha, sabase badi puraani party ko jadon se kate or dusron ke sahare badhane vaale netaaon ke changul se bachaane kii jarurat he, jinhone do dashak se adhik samay se party par adhikaar jamaa rakhaa he or party ko is sthiti main pahunchaa diya he
 Dev said in an interview to PTI that Rahul Gandhi had said a lot about the change in the organization after becoming vice president in Jaipur
 agar party usamen se 50 pratishat par nirnay le leti, to yah halaat nahin banate
 He alleged that the party and its leadership were under the control of one or two dozen people
 unhone kaha ki rahul ke saath priyanka gandhi ko bhi congress ko in bandhanon se mukti dilaane ke liye kaam karnaa chahie
 The tribal affairs minister said that due to inflation and scams, a credit crisis had arisen on the Congress-led alliance
 party or sarkaar apni kathani or kerani se in muddon par ho rahe dushprachaar kaa prabhavi tareeke se jawaab nahin de sake
 Making serious allegations on the party's position in Seemandhra, Dev said, Congress was politically mortgaged to Jagan, YSR Congress and one of their factions and almost sold
 party main puri tarah kuprabandhan kaa aarope lagaate hue dev ne kaha ki jahaan raajnneetik sthiti kii samaj kharaab rahi, vahiin rajya ke ek congress prabharee ne congress adhyaksh ko galat jaankaree bhi di
 He said that the notes sent by the in-charge to the party president on many issues were also not affected
 dev ke mutabik aam dharna bahut nakaaratmak thi
 The general belief was that the Congress withdrew from the YSR Congress in the belief that later Jaganmohan would convince Reddy, but these things did not help
 unhone kaha ki simandhra main congress ne chunaav ladane se pehle hi haar sweekaar kar lee thi
 He said that because of this, weak candidates were fielded in many assembly constituencies and the financial support from AICC was also very less
 congress ko loksabhaa chunaav main simandhra kshetra main 25 main se ek bhi seat par jeet nahin mili or vidhansabha chunaavon main bhi uskaa pradarshan kharaab rahaa
 The Congress leader said that the party has good Chief Ministers in Kerala and Karnataka and has given better results
 loksabhaa main congress kii kul 44 siton main se karnataka main nau or kerala main aath hai

 bisisiai ke anbhavi prashaasak kii jagah lene ke liye isaki purv kshetra kii ikaayiyon ne apana ummidavaar khadaa karne kaa faisla kiya he
 This has brought a new twist in the battle of succession
 puri sambhaavna he ki purv kshetra kii ikaiyaan bisisiai adhyaksh pad ke liye jharkhand ke sanyukt sachiv amitabh choudhary ko apane ummidavaar ke rup main pesh karen
 The former has six votes
 There is also speculation about the names of Sharad Pawar and Rajeev Shukla for the post of president, but it will not be easy to get the proposals and approvals from these two experienced politicians from the former region
 purv kshetra main chah vot hai jisamen bengal, assam, jharkhand, odisha, tripura or rashtriya cricket club (ensisi) shaamil hai
 At the moment there is a possibility that if Shukla or Pawar present their candidature, then elections will have to be held and the selection will not be unanimous
 isisi or bisisiai ke purv adhyaksh pavaar tabhi apni ummidavaari pesh karenge jab unhone kam se kam 16 vot milanaa tay ho or iske liye unhen sarkaar ke samarthan kii jarurat padegi
 Anyway, veteran politician Pawar is known to decide after a long and detailed discussion
 IPS officer hai amitabh choudharypurv kshetra ke adhikariyon ne pichley do dinon main ek duusare ke saath anaupchaarik charchaa kii he or is nattejey par pahunche hai ki 2017 tak adhyaksh unke kshetra se hona chahie
 a top BCCI official from East Zone said on condition of anonymity, 'states of the East Zone want someone to become the President from their region
 is samay amitabh choudhary isamen feet baithte hai
 "he is an IPS officer, running the Jharkhand State Cricket Association (JSCA), he has participated in the AGM and is an officer
" purv kshetra kii kam se kam chaar ikaiyaan unki ummidavaari kaa samarthan karengi
 We say that from 2017, there should be someone from the East Zone for this post
 agar aisa nahin hua to chunaav kii sambhaavna se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa
 You can be assured that if Pawar contests, the cab and NCC (like Dalmia's family club) will not vote in his favor

 Like treasurer Anirudh Chaudhary of Haryana, Amitabh Chaudhary is also considered as a confidant of Srinivasan
 purv kshetra main ab bhi shrinivasana ko assam, bengal, odisha or jharkhand ke rup main kaaphi samarthan hasil he
 Not easy for Shukla, Shukla also has friends in various political parties, but it will not be easy for her to get a proposer from the former region
 vah haalanki apana ummidavaar nahin utaarne or sarvasammat pasand ke rup main unka samarthan karne ke liye purv kshetra kii ikaayiyon ko manaane kii koshish kar sakate hai
 Meanwhile, a special meeting of the BCCI General Assembly may be moved beyond the proposed 15 days unless the situation is clear for the BCCI on the representation of n Srinivasan

 Shakuntala Gamlin's letter to the Principal Secretary in the Government of Delhi has become a problem for Delhi's Industry Minister Satyendar Jain
 gamelin kaa sidhaa aarope he ki mantri satyendra jain audyogic plot ko lij se free-hold karaane kaa lagaataar dabaav daal rahe hai
 While this work is outside the purview of Delhi government, but the minister does not think that he has done anything wrong
 darasal leez hold kaa matlab he ki kisi zamin ko niyat sharton par istemaal ke liye dena
 While free-hold gives the ownership of the land, which does not include any condition
 dilli main 32 audyogic ilaake hai, jinamein kareeb 60 hazaar plot hai
 Out of these, about 20 thousand plots have already been free-held
 ab qareeb 40,000 plot bache hai jo audyogic leez ke tahat hai
 Industries argue that if they are free-held, business will become easier
 kaarobaar se jude logon kaa kahana he kii lij hold main jis kaarobaar ke liye license mila hota he uske liye lone bhi nahin miltaa he
 Apart from that, no other goods can be made
 saath hi license sirf usee ke naam miltaa he jise plot aavantit hua hota he

 jabaki free-hold zamin kii milkiyat detii he, jisamen koi shart shaamil nahin hoti
 Delhi has 32 industrial areas with around 60 thousand plots
 inamen se kareeb 20 hazaar plot pehle hi free-hold ho chuke hai
 There are now about 40,000 plots left which are under industrial lease
 udyogon kii daleel he ki agar inhen free-hold kar diya gaya to kaarobaar aasaan ho jayega
 People associated with the business say that loans are not available for the business for which the license is obtained in the lease hold
 uske alaava koi doosraa saamaan bana nahin sakate
 Also, the license is available only to the person to whom the plot is allotted

 Regarding the proposal given last week by Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi about the renovation of Kedarnath temple, Togadia said that the world famous Hindu pilgrimage center Kedarnath temple is completely safe and Bhagwat idols of the temple complex are also safe
 unhone kaha ki kedarnath mandir parisar ke aasapaas kii dharmashalaayein, anya dharmik sthal evam bhawan badal fatne se aayi pralayankari baadh main bah gayi hai
 For their construction, work should be done on war footing with the cooperation of all interested people and institutions
 togadiya ne aapadaa ke is kaal main uttarakhand sarkaar ke raahat evam bachaav kaary ke liye kiye ja rahe prayaason par santosh vyakt kiya
 Taking a dig at the BJP, Togadia said, "when a large number of Congress leaders and security personnel were killed in the Naxalite attack in Chhattisgarh, the BJP leaders were saying that this is a national calamity and there should be no politics to deal with it but now when a more dire situation has come in Uttarakhand, so why is she doing politics about it
 ’togadiya ne haal hi main jediu ke endie se alag hone kaa swaagat kiya or kaha, ‘main is tut se sarvaadhik prasann hum

 China Wall- The construction of the China Wall was completed at the last turn of Franz Kafkautar
 dakshin-purv or dakshin-pashchim kii deevaaron ke donon bhaag yaheen aakar mil gaye the
 This piecemeal theory was adopted at small levels by both the eastern and western labor forces
 yah is prakaar kiya gaya thah kareeb bees mazdooron kaa ek samooh banaakar ek nishchit lambaai kii diwaar banane kaa kaam de diya jaataa he, jaise paanch sau gaj lambi diwaar
 Similarly, another group would be employed on similar lengths, whose work was finished at the end of the work done by the first group
 lekin donon deevaaron ke milane ke baad unase us sthaan se aage kaam nahin karaayaa jaataa tha, jaise maan lo hajaar gaj diwaar jahaan puri hui, vahaan se nahin varan mazdooron ke in donon samoohon ko paas ke kisi duusare ilaake main diwaar banane laga diya jaataa tha
 Naturally, large sections were left in the middle of the wall, which were later made into small pieces, even after the official announcement of the construction of the wall, the walls were still built at these empty places
 sach to yah he ki kuch logon kii raay main to bahut se aise bhaagon ko kabhi puraa hi nahin kiya gaya
 This was a fact that became popular as legend with the construction of the wall and was never tested
 kam se kam kisi ek vyakti ke dwaara jisane apni aankhon se puri diwaar ko dekha ho, diwaar itani lambi jo thi
 According to the general thinking, no one would have said that it would have been better to have a wall built from one end or to make it continuous by dividing it into two parts
 antat sach to yahi tha or yahi uddeshy puri duniya ko batalaaya gaya tha ki iske nirmaan kaa uddeshy uttar ke nivaasiyon se raksha karnaa he
 But how could such a wall be protected if its construction is not completed
 aisi diwaar na keval raksha karne main asamarth hogi varan yah to lagaataar khatare kaa kaaran bhi bani rahegi
 These large sections of the wall, which were left in the desert, were repeatedly dropped by nomads
 visheshkar isliye kyonki ye adivasee jatiyaan in deevaaron ko lekar sashankit thim
 And they kept changing their camps fast, like locusts, that's why they knew more about the construction of the wall, at least we were more likely than the wall makers, however, and in some way the construction of the wall was not possible, To understand this decision, first look at a few things - the wall had to be protected for centuries to come, so complete caution was unavoidable in the construction, so the previous The primary need was a sense of responsibility among the manufacturers with the use of centuries of manufacturing experience
 yah sach tha ki diwaar banane ke liye anpadh-naasamajh mazdooron ke rup main aadamiyon, auraton or bacchon ko rosendaaree par rakh liya gaya tha
 But the laborers who came for four days needed a knowledgeable person who is proficient in construction work, a person who is perfect in working and conducting wholeheartedly
 or jitna bada kaary utani badi jimmedaari
 Also, there was a need for such people who could work whole day and whole heartedly in the construction work, not only this, there was a large number of such people
 lekin diwaar nirmaan kaa yah kaary bina soch-vichaar ke armbh nahin kiya gaya tha
 Long before the first stone was laid, the art of architecture, especially building art, was proclaimed around as a branch of the best of knowledge in the vast landmass of China, as the country needed to be surrounded by walls
 It was, in addition, the inquiry into the same part or branch of other arts, in which references related to the same subject were given
 mujhe acchhee tarah yaad he ki ham bachche jo thik se abhi sadhe panjon par khadaa hona bhi nahin jaanate the, ham apane shikshak ke bageeche main khadey the- jahaan hamen gol pattharon se diwaar jaisaa kuch banane kaa aadesh diya gaya tha or tabhi shikshak apane choge ko kasakar band puri takat se diwaar se takaraayaa tha
 Naturally the wall had collapsed and he had scolded us so hard for our inferior work that we all ran loudly crying to our parents in all four directions
 ek behad saamaanya ghatana kintu mahatvapurn kyonki yah apane samay kii aatma kii parichaayak thi
 i was fortunate at the time when the construction of the wall started
 us samay main bees varshon kaa tha or maine nimnastareey skool kii antim pariksha uteern kar lee thi
 i have deliberately said to be fortunate, because before me the majority of the people had passed the highest degrees of culture which they had attained, but from year to year they did not get any work in exchange for their knowledge
 parinamswaroop ve kisi tarah apni zindagi kaat rahe the, jabaki unke siron ke andar mahatvapurn or sundar sthapaty sambandhi yojanaayen thim or iske baavjood ve niraashaa kii gartt main dub gaye the
 But some of those who got work as supervisors, even though it was of lower standard than their knowledge, were still fully dedicated to their work
 vahaan aise rajgir bhi the jinhone bahut sochaa-vichaara tha or jinhone vichaar-manthan karnaa abhi bhi band nahin kiya tha, kam se kam diwaar ke nirmaan ko lekar
 People who moved themselves to the foundations of the first stone and accepted the integral part of the wall
 rajgiron kaa yah varg swaabhaavik he teevr ichha rakhata tha ki vah apana kaary puri nishtha or eemaandaaree ke saath puri shiddat ke saath kare
 Not only this, they were desperate and desperate to get the whole wall suitable
 dainik mazdooron main dhairya kaa abhaav tha, kyonki ve maatr apane dainik vetan par hi dhyaan rakhte the
 The middle supervisors along with the high ranking supervisors also kept their faith firm and high, keeping the polymorphic development at the center
 kintu apane sahaayak suparvijaron ko protsaahit karne ke liye jo unke bauddhik str se paryaapt neeche the, or jo ise behad saadhaaran kaam maanate the, unke liye duusare raste nikaalnaa aavashyak tha
 Like, for example, one did not expect that they would be able to keep one stone for another month or year after year - in a mountainous state full of mountains, living thousands of miles away from their homes, plus this disappointment
 With that this hard work is not going to be completed even in their long life
 yah soch unhen niraashaa kii khai main patake detii- falswaroop swaabhaavik he ve apana kaam lagan se karnaa band kar dete
 This reality was planned to be constructed in pieces only after the manthan
 paanch sau gaj lambi diwaar kariban paanch varshon main puri hone kaa anumaan tha or in varshon main suparvijaron kii puri tarah shakti or urja samaapt ho chuki hogi, yahan tak ki ve swayan par vishwaas karnaa bhi bhul chuke honge, yahi kyon, unka to diwaar or duniya par se hi vishwaas khandit ho chukaa hoga
 That is why they were sent far, far away when they were proud of their construction, full of enthusiasm for the completion of the construction of the thousand yards wall
 raste main unhen yahan-vahaan banati diwaar, puri ho chuki diwaar dikhti, ve ucchadhikariyon ke makaanon ke paas se nikalate the jahaan unhen sammanpurvak padak bhent kiye jate the
 New army of laborers were seen cheering enthusiastically from the vast land area of the country, watching the trees cut down the forests and erecting trees for the support of the walls, breaking the rocks of the mountains, watching the stones coming out for the walls, the walls in the holy places
 He listened to prayers done for perfection, and kept on moving with enthusiasm
 ye sabhi drishy milakar unki adheeratha ko shant karne main sahyog dete the
 a few days' rest in their homes, where they stayed for a few days, filled them with new energy
 jis vishwaas ke saath unki kaary reporton ko suna jaataa tha, jis bharose ke saath sidhe-sade shantipriy kisaan unase diwaar purna hone kii soochna se aashwasti vyakt karte the, isse unki aatmavishvaas kii gaanth sakht ho jaati thi
 Like eternal hopeful children, they would say goodbye to their homes, and once again they had a keen desire to get involved in building the country wall
 chhuttiyaan samaapt hone ke pehle hi ve nikal padane ko aatur ho uthte the or unhen vidaa karne aadha gaanv unke saath bahut dur tak keval unke utsaah ko dekh chalata jaataa tha
 Banners and groups of people shaking scarves met them on all roads
 yah sab dekh unhen yah ahsaas pahili baar hota tha ki unka desh kitna mahaan, sampann or sundar tha
 Every countryman was his brother, for whom he was building a wall, a wall of protection and a lifetime of gratitude for his gift, for everything he had
 ekta! ekta! kandhe se sata kandha, bhaaiyon kaa gheraa, rakt sanchaar, jo maatr ek deh main simit nahin he, varan prem se bahata or lautataa hua aseem china kii simaaon se
 In this way, this arrangement of blocks was made possible, but there were other reasons besides this
 itani der tak isi prashn par ruke rahanaa vyarth bhi nahin he, yah vastav main is diwaar ke nirmaan main ek mahatvapurn prashn he
 Even though cursoryly it does not look so important
 yadi mujhe yah baat batalaani he or us kaal kii soch or bhaawanaaon ko samajhane yogya banani he, to is prashn par bina gambheertha se charchaa kiye yah sambhav hi nahin hoga, haalanki adhik gaharaai tak janaa mere vash main he nahin
 First of all, in those days, the construction of weak towers was not thought of in comparison to the construction of the tower of Babel
 haalaanki jahaan tak daivik sahmati yaa anumati kaa prashn he or jahaan tak manushyon kii soch kaa prashn he, vah kaary se adhik asangat nahin ho saktaa, yah main isliye kah rahaa hoon kyonki nirmaan ke shuruaati daur main ek scollar ne ek pustak likhi thi, jisamen usne vistaar se donon nirmaan kii tulana kii thi
 In the book, he tried to prove that the Babel Tower did not fail in its purpose, for reasons that were being spoken around the world or that the most important of the accepted arguments had never been revealed
 uske tark or saboot na keval likhit paripatron yaa reporton par hi aadhaarit the
 According to him, he had himself inspected the place itself and after that concluded that the tower failed in its purpose and had to fail - the reason was its foundation
 is pariprekshya main hamaara samay us pracheen kaal se paryaapt shreshth he
 Almost every educated person in us is professionally Rajgir in our time and is proficient in laying the foundation
 haalaanki vah scoler maatr yahi siddh nahin karnaa chahta tha, kyonki uski raay main mahaan diwaar maanav itihaas main ekmaatr gavaah hogi, saath hi nai bebal kii minar kii surakshit neenv bhi rakhegi
 Hence first the wall and then the tower
 us jamaane main yah pustak prayek haath main hua karti thi, lekin main sweekaar karata hoon ki main aaj bhi yah samaj nahin paaya hoon ki aakhir usne minar ke bare main sochaa kyon tha
 Well a wall that does not make half a sphere, hardly a quarter or half a sphere, how will it form the foundation of a tower
 iskaa taatpary yah he ki ise aadhyatmik arth main hi sweekaara gaya hoga
 But if this was true, then what was the need to build a wall, which was fully realized, the wages of thousands of millions of lives, the culmination of the realization of blood and sweat? At the same time, the plans described in the book, the blurry blurb-like tower plans were elaborated on how the power and energy of the people would be used in this great work? In that era people had one to one bizarre relationship
 The idea was - Schalar's book is just an example - perhaps because the majority of people together can reach this goal with the full power as far as possible
 Go ahead not
 maanviya swabhaav anivarytah parivartansheel he
 Unstable like dust that does not resist
 yadi vah apane ko band bhi letaa he to turant hi paaglon kii tarah use kholane main jute jaataa he
 Until he rips everything off
 chaahe vah diwaar ho yaa koi bandhan, yahan tak ki swayan ko bhi
 It is possible that all these opposing views which stood in opposition to the construction of the wall must have been in the mind of the High Command, when they decided to build the block
 main yahan paryaapt badi sankhya kii ore se bol rahaa hoon, ve vastav main unhen jaanate hi nahi hai
 When we looked at the orders passed by the High Command, we found that without the High Command, neither our books nor our human intelligence would have been sufficient, which we have been doing for the whole work through our small efforts
 command aphis main- vah kahan tha or vahaan koun baithta tha, jisase bhi maine prashn kiya ve is sambandh main kuch bhi nahin jaanate the or na hi ab jaanate hai- us aphis main yah nishchit taur par kaha ja saktaa he ki manushyon kaa prayek vichaar or icchaayen vahaan chakkar lagaati rahati thim or unke sabhi maanviya uddeshy or purnataayen pratyuttar main vahaan upasthit thim
 At the same time, the shadow of the glory of the divine world was placed in the hands of the leaders from the windows there when they discussed their plans
 or isiilie bhrashtachar se pare rahane waalon ko yah jaananaa chahie ki netritv yadi gambheertha se kaamana karata to vah in baadhaon ke paar bhi ja saktaa tha, jo lagaataar nirmaan ke virodh main tha, atah shesh bachataa he maatr yah nishkarsh ki netritv ne jaanboojhkar khand-nirmaan kaa chunaav kiya tha
 But block construction was inappropriate in mere shifts
 atah nishkarsh yah nikalataa he ki netritv kuch anupyukt kii hi ichha karata tha- ascharyajanak nishkarsh he na! yah sach he or ek drushtikon se is par bahut kuch kaha ja saktaa he
 Today, anyone can discuss this subject comfortably without any concern
 un dinon adhikansh log or unamem se bhi shreshth mastishkon ke swaamiyon ke paas bhi ek gupt rahasyamay kathan tha, jiske anusaar hai command ke aadesh ko apni puri kshamta se purna karne kii koshish karo
 But just to a certain point - after that stop thinking about it completely
 ek sookhti va samajhadaari bhari sookhti, jiske vishay main vistaar se ek nitiktha main darshaya gaya he, jise log praayah uddhrut kar diya karte the, aage dhyaan dene se bacho, lekin isliye nahin ki vah haniprad ho saktaa he, kyonki yah bhi antatah nishchit nahin he ki vah haniprad vastav main he hi
 There is no relation to the question of what is harmful and what is not, so it is better to think about the river in the spring
 vah failati-badhati jaati he, jab tak vah shaktishaalee nahin ho jaati or dharti kaa paalan-poshan karti he apane taton kaa dur-dur tak, lekin apni disha ko kabhi nahin bhuulati or usee par chalati rahati he, jab tak vah samudr se mil nahin jaati, jahaan uskaa khule hriday se swaagat kiya jaataa he
 Because he is a suitable ally - so it is necessary to follow and follow the instructions of the High Command for some distance, but after that the river breaks its banks, its shape disappears, slowing its stream speed 
 apni niyati kii chintaa na kar dharti ke upar hi apane swayan ke chote-chote samudron kaa nirmaan kar leti he, kheton ko nuksaan pahunchaati he or itnaa sab karne ke baavjood apane nae roopakar ko adhik samay tak banaae nahin rakh paati or apane puraane taton ke bich bahane ko use taiyaar hona padataa he
 It also has to dry in many places during the summer
 swaabhaavik he vah mausam bhi aata hi he- isiilie adhik duuri tak hai command ke nirdeshon or niyamon par tumhen chintan-manan karne kii aavashyaktaa hi nahin he
 Now this folklore may have had a greater impact on wall construction, but for my present article it has only limited reference
 meri jaanch-padtaal or khoj to vishuddh rup se aitihaasik he, bahut dinon se koi bijli na to laplapaati he, na hi kaundhti hi he, kyonki garajane vaale badal kahin nahin hai, or isliye main is prakhand nirmaan kii vyavastha kii vyakhya karnaa chahta hoon, jo vahaan se bahut aage jaati he
 To which the people of that time used to get satisfied
 meri vaicharik kshamta paryaapt simit he, kintu jis lambe-chaude vishaal bhu-bhaag par mujhe chalanaa he vah aseem he
 What was this great wall built to protect? Against the inhabitants of the north! Now i am from southeast of China
 uttar kaa koi bhi vyakti hamaare liye khataranaak nahin ban saktaa
 We read in old books, about the cruelties which they committed due to their nature, which we take long breaths while reading under the peaceful trees
 kalakaaron dwaara kiye gaye unke yatharth chithran hamen batalaate hai in shaitan chehron ke khule munh se jhaankate bade-bade nukile daant, unki adhkhuli ankhen jo pahile se hi shikaar ko apane jabadon main fasaa nigalane ko taiyaar hai
 Whenever our children are devilish, we show them these pictures and at a glance they weep in our arms crying
 bas, iske atirikt ham uttaravasiyon ke vishay main kuch bhi nahin jaanate
 We have not seen them and if we come to the villages, we will never see them, even if they run fast to their wild horses directly towards us
 tab bhi nahin, hamaara desh bahut vishaal he or unhen hamaare paas tak pahunchne nahin degaa, unki manzil khaali hawa main hi gaayab ho jaaegi
 If this is true then why did we leave our house, the springs with their bridges, our mothers and fathers, our wives, our children who need us
 ham dur based shaharon main training ke liye kyon jate hai, jabaki hamaari kalpana hamen vahaan se bhi bahut dur vahaan le jaati he jahaan diwaar he
 Why? Question for High Command
 hamaare netaa hamaare swabhaav se acchhee tarah parichit hai
 Even though they are worried about huge problems, they know about us, our small aspirations
 ve hamen apni choti-choti jhonpadiyon main baitha dekhte hai, hamaari sandhyaa prarthanaaon se sahamat-asahmat hote dekhte rahete hai, jise ghar kaa burjug parivaar ke bich doharaata baitha rahata he
 If i am allowed to express my views of this kind, i would say that in my opinion the High Command has existed since ancient times, it has not been summoned, the Mendereen gathered quickly; There is a Chinese language that is called to discuss someone's dream, and he is dismissed as soon as possible, so that the same evening, people are beaten up by drums
 nirnay ke anusaar nirdhaarit kaam karne ke liye, bhale hi vah kuch bhi kyon na ho, vah ek puchchal tara hi ho, jo ishwar ke sammaan main niklaa ho
 The one who had done the important work of the owners one day before and the other day was pushed into a dark corner by hitting and hitting the sticks
 vah bhi puchchal taare ke antim bhaag ke lupt hone ke pehle bhale hi bahut dur kyon na ho
 i believe that the High Command has existed since time immemorial and in the same way the decision to build their walls
 ab yah to unka agyaan hi he ki uttaravasi samajhate hai unke kaaran diwaar banaai ja rahi he
 Unknown honest emperor who imagined that he had ordered construction
 ham diwaar nirmaan main vyast rajgir acchhee tarah jaanate hai ki aisa kuch he nahin, iske saath hi ham apni jubaan bhi hameshaa band rakhte hai
 From the time the wall was built, to this day i have engaged myself in the only work of comparative history of castes - there are some questions which one may wish to reach the bone of his bones, as they are, in exactly the same way and i discovered It is taken that we Chinese have some folk and some political institutions, which are clear in their specifics, and some are specialized in rigor
 in vichitrataaon ke kaarnon ko jaanane kii teevr ichha, visheshkar baad main hui
 Events have always teased me and still tease me and wall building is also a part of this problem
 hamaare yahan sarvaadhik duruh sanstha aap jaanate hai samrajya hi he
 It is natural in Peking's state court that there is enough clarity in this subject, although that too is more misleading than reality
 saath hi hiskool ke rajnatik-vidhi evam vidhi ke shikshak yah maanate hai ki ve is vishay ke gyaata hai or unamem itani samarthy he ki ve us gyaan ko apane chaatro ko dene main bhi samarth hai
 The more a society goes to the lower level schools, naturally there are teachers and students who are not at all aware of their knowledge and a superficial showy culture is seen progressively rising to the height of the sky
 jo kuch niyamon ke chaaron ore gumti he, jinhen logon ke mastishkon main sadiyon se dhunda jaataa rahaa he
 The rule or order, its azar-immortal truth, from which nothing has diminished, but they have always been invisible in the fog of the perpetrators
 kintu yah samrajya kaa prashn hi to he jo meri raay main saamaanya janata se jiskaa uttar poocha janaa chahie, kyonki ve hi to hai jo samrajya ke antim aasraa hai
 Here, i accept that i can only say honestly about my place of birth
 prakritik devtaa or unke karmkand jo puure varsh ko sundarata or pyaare parivartanon se bhare rakhte hai, iske atirikt yadi hamaare chintan kaa koi vishay hota he to ve samraat hi hai
 But not to the present emperor, or if we would have thought about the present if we had known who he was, or had known some facts about him, the truth is that the eagerness in which we are always busy - We make every effort
 is vishay main jaankariyon or suchnaayen praapt karne kii, chaahe ve tirthayatriyon se hi kyon na milen, kyonki unhone lambe-chaude ilaake kii yatra kii hoti he, yaa phir paas yaa dur ke gaanvon se, yaa navikon se, kyonki unhone na keval hamaare jharanon ko paar kiya hota he varan pavitra nadiyon ko bhi
 a lot of information and news is available to a person, it is true, but nothing can gather certain facts
 hamaara desh itnaa vishaal he ki koi bhi puranic katha uski vishalata ke saath nyaay nahin kar sakati
 Heaven (sky) cannot measure it, and peaking is only one point in it, and the Emperor's palace is smaller than the point
 duusari ore jahaan tak samraat kaa prashn he vah duniya ke sabhi dharmik rajnatik virgon main sarvaadhik shaktishaalee hai, yah main sweekaarta hoon
 But the current emperor is a person like you, who lies on the bed just like us, who may be huge or even likely to be small and narrow
 hamaari hi tarah vah kabhi-kabhaar swayan ko khinchataa he or jab vah thak jaataa he to sundar taraashe munh se jamhai bhi letaa he
 But how do we know all this - thousands of miles away from the borders of Tibet's mountain ranges in the south? And with this, all the feverish people who get up there, even if they reach us, arrive very late and are already lost before we reach them
 samraat sadaiv budhimaan kintu phir bhi aspasht se darbariyon or kulinon se ghire rahete hai- naukaron va mitron ke vesh main vidwesh or shatruta-jo samrajya kii shakti par virdohi dabaav banaate hai or lagaataar samraat ko padchyut karne ke liye vishakt baan chalaate rahete hai
 The empire is immortal, but the emperor himself stumbles and is removed from the throne
 haan, sach yahi he ki samrajya antatah dub jate hai or apni maut kii badbadaahat main antim saansen lete hai
 The public is never familiar with these struggles and sufferings
 haare-thake aaagantukon kii tarah, shahar main aane vaale ajanabiyon kii tarah, kisi bheed bhari sadak ke kinare khadey ho, saath laae khaane ko chabate khadey rahete hai, jabaki usee ilaake ke saamne bahut-bahut dur shahar ke bich ke chauraahey par unke shaasha ko phaansi di ja rahi hoti he
 There is a policy narrative that explains this whole situation very well: The emperor, according to this legend, sent a message to you, near a simple citizen, the sun of the kingdom, far away, far away from his vast country
 Near the insignificant shadow, the emperor sent a message only to you from his deathbed
 usne sandesavahak ko aadesh diya ki vah uske palang ke paas ghutanon ke bal baith jaae, or tab usne fusfusaakar sandesh batalaaya
 Then he emphatically told the messenger that whatever message he had just told, he should repeat it in his ears
 sunne ke baad usne sir hilaakar yah nishchit kiya ki sandesh sahi he
 You did not see that among the countless spectators of his death — where all the obstructing walls and blockers were toppled and all the princes of the empire stood on high staircases — he recited his message in front of them
 sandesavahak turant apni yatra par nikal padaa, ek tandurust, na thakne vaala aadmi- ab apane daahine haath ko aage badhaata, phir baayein ko, is prakaar bheed kii cheerata vah apni raah par chalata gaya
 Wherever he faced opposition, he immediately pointed to his chest, where the sun sign was shining
 turant hi uske liye rasta aasaan kar diya jaataa tha, jo anya kisi ke liye nahin hota
 But the population is so large that there is no end to their number
 yadi vah khule kheton-maidaanon main pahunch jaataa to vah kitni teji se udata hua-sa chalata or nissandeh bahut jaldi aap apane daravaajon par uski mutthiyon kii awaz sunate
 But this does not happen - his power begins to wane very soon, but he continues to make some way in the corridors of the inner part of the palace, at which end he will never reach and if he succeeds
 But even then nothing is going to happen
 use sidhiyon ke bich main lard-jhagadkar rasta bananaa hoga or yadi vah safal ho bhi jaataa he, to bhi kuch phayda hone vaala nahin he
 Now he has to cross the courts, second external palace after the courts and then once stairs and court and then another palace and so on for thousands of years this same sequence and if finally he is able to break through the outer doors
 - But no, it will never happen - The capital of the empire will be in front of it, the center of the world, filled to the brim with its garbage
 yahan se lard-jhagadkar koi bhi rasta banaakar ja hi nahin saktaa, yahan tak ki mritak kaa shok sandesh lekar bhi
 Therefore, it is better that you sit near the window while the sun sets and in the evening descending and dream it yourself
 to in paristhitiyon main, itani niraashaaon ke bich aashaa ko jivit rakh hamaari janata samraat kaa sammaan karti he
 They do not even know who is ruling the emperor, not only that, they also have doubts about the dynasty
 skulon main paryaapt vistaar se rajwanshon or unke ucchadhikariyon ke bare main vistaar se tarikhon sahit padhaayaa jaataa he, lekin is sambandh main sarvakalik anischitata chali aa rahi he ki shreshthatam vidvatjan bhi iske bhramjaal main fas jate hai
 i do not know when the emperors who were killed are seated on the throne in our village and the one who is alive only in songs, just a few days ago his proclamations have been read at the place of worship
 yuddh jo pracheen itihaas main dafan hai, hamaare liye haal-philhal hi hue hai or kisi kaa bhi padosi chamakate-damakate chehre ke saath uske samachar ko aae-din sunaate dekha ja saktaa he
 The queens of the emperors, often patrolled by shrewd courtesans, royal customs, often rejoice in their disgusting habits, with unrestrained and fiercely greedy in ambivalent aspirations from ambitions
 ve apane samay main jitani gaharaai main dafan hai, unke kaaryon ko utane hi gahare rangon se ranga jaataa he or dard bhari lambi-si aah ke saath hamaare gaanv vaale antatah sunate hai ki kaise hajaaron varshon pahile ek samraji ne akaal ke dinon main apane hi pati kaa raktpan kiya tha
 You do not understand how our people treat their past emperors, but the irony is that they even consider the living rulers dead
 yadi ek baar, bas aadmi kii zindagi main ek baar koi rajkeey adhikari apane prantiya daure par maan lo dhokhe se hamaare gaanv main aa jaave na, or shashan kii ore se kuch ghoshnaayen kar de yaa phir kar-suchi kii jaanch kar le, yaa skool ke bacchon kii pariksha le le yaa pujari se hamaare kriya-kalapon ke vishay main prashn kar le or phir iske pahile ki vah apni palki main baithe or ekatrit samuhik gramvaasiyon ke saamne apane nishkarshon kii chetavaniyon ko shabdon kaa rup de-prayek ke chehre par muskaraahat tairne lagegi, har koi apane padosi kii ore chor-nigaah se dekhegaa or apane bacchon ke saath qamar tak jhuk jaavega taaki adhikari kisi mritak ke vishay main aise batala rahe hai, jaise vah jivit na ho, jabaki unka yah samraat to bahut pahile hi mar chukaa he, uskaa vansh hi samaapt ho chukaa he
 Well the officer is really joking with us about it, but we will behave as if we have not paid attention to it so that it is not insulted
 kintu ham puri nishtha or eemaandaaree se apane vartmaan shaasha ke alaava or kisi kii bhi ajna nahin maanate, kyonki aisa karnaa to ghor dandaneey aparaadh hoga na
 -and as soon as the officer's palanquin departs, she stands up like a ruler of the village, like an urn filled with joy, which has already been found in the dust
 is prakaar hamaari janata par na to rajya main hoti kisi kranti yaa vidroh kaa koi prabhaav padataa he, na hi kisi samakaleen yuddh kaa
 i remember an incident from my youth
 hamaare pados main vidroh ho gaya tha, haalaanki khaase dur ke praant main
 What was the reason, i do not remember it now and then it has no significance today
 vidroh ke kaaran to yahan kisi bhi din paae ja sakate hai, aap to jaanate hi hai janata kitni jaldi uttejit ho jaati he
 Yes, then one day a paper distributed by the rebels brought a beggar to my father's house, who had come through that province
 vah bhoj kaa din tha, hamaare kamare mehmaanon se bhare the, pujari ne pramukh aasandi par baithkar use padhaa
 Suddenly everyone started laughing, that piece of paper burst, the beggar who had received more than the begging needed, was kicked out of the room with fists and thumping, and the guests dispersed to enjoy the happy day
 bhala aisa kyon hua? us pados ke praant kii sthaneey bhashaa hamaari apni bhashaa se paryaapt bhinn he or yah bhinnata likhane kii bhashaa main bhi aa jaati he, jo hamaare puraatan bhav ko samahit kiye hue he
 Right now, the priest had read only two lines that we had concluded our conclusions
 pracheenatam itihaas jo hamen bahut pehle hi batala diya gaya tha, puraane ghaav jo bahut pehle hi suukh chuke hai
 However, it seems to be remembered today - the awesomeness of the present life was described in a beggar's pamphlet of words, which we all laughed and shook our heads and were not ready to hear
 itane besabr hai ham log apane vartmaan ko bhuulane ke liye
 Seeing all this, if someone comes to the conclusion that we do not really have an emperor, he is not far from the truth
 baar-baar ise doharaate rahanaa hoga
 Probably no more than our people will own the emperor's own public, especially in the south, but the emperor does not benefit from our credibility
 sach he ki pavitra dregon; ajgar- hamaare gaanv ke ant main lage ek khambhe par khadaa he or maanviya smriti ke praarambhik kaal se hi vah apni agni kii lapaton se bhari shwasein peking kii ore sammaan main phenkata chalaa aa rahaa he, lekin peking hamaare gaanvvaasiyon ke prati duusari duniya kii tulana main kuch zyada hi anudaar he
 Will there be a village anywhere, where the houses are built adjacent to each other and all the fields are filled with houses - standing on our hill and turning our eyes around a long distance, anyone can testify this
 or kya in gharon main itane adhik logon kii bheed din-raat bhari rah sakati he? aise shahar ke chitra ko bananaa hamaare liye adhik kathin he, bajaay is baat par vishwaas karne ke, ki peking or samraat ek hi hai, ek badal kahana chahie jo aaraam se surya ke neeche yugon se yatra kar rahaa he
 Now after the conclusions drawn after such opinion, life will be completely free and indefinite
 haalaanki aniatik kisi bhi rup main nahin
 i have not found such pure moral values in my travels as many in our own villages
 kintu iske baavjood ek aisi jindagi jo samakaleen niyam-kaayadon se katai prabhavit nahin hoti ho or jo maatr pracheen niyamon or khataron ko hi sweekaarte hon
 i would not like to elaborately generalize, nor say emphatically: that the behavior of the countless villages in my province is similar, less than that of the five hundred provinces of China
 kintu sambhavtah is vishay main padhe bahut se lekhon or apane vyaktigat anubhavon ke baad main jor dekar kah saktaa hoon - diwaar ke nirmaan main vishesh taur par jisamen maanviya shakti or urja lagaai gai ho, ek avasar mila jisase sabhi praanton kii atmaaon ko samajhane kaa avasar praapt hua, isi ke aadhaar par sambhavtah main jor dekar kah saktaa hoon ki samraat ke prati vartmaan drushtikon saamanytah saarvkalik rup main vahi he, jo hamaare apane gaanv kaa he
 Now i have no desire to make any change in the truth contained in this idea, but the opposite is true that its primary responsibility is that of the government, which is one of the oldest empires in the world, and in its development No success has been achieved and the development is denied, in which the empire is developed as an institution that its functioning is directly Security barriers to reach the most distant villages of the country
 duusari ore yah bhi sach he ki janata kii kalpana kshamta or vishwaas main kami he, jo use peking samrajya kii gatiheenata ko jaagrath karne main samarth hoti or uski vartmaan sachchaaiyon ko apane seene se lagane ke liye prerit karti
 The public who does not wish for more than that at least touched it and then left to die
 yah dharna koi nishchit gun nahin he
 Yet it is important that this weakness affects the unity of our people the most
 yadi koi aisa kehane kaa saahas kare ki us zamin main jisamen ham rahete hai to, yahan kisi dosha ko sthapit karne kaa arth hamaare vivek ko aswikaarna maatr hi nahin hoga varan usase bura hoga hamaare pairon ke tale kii zamin ko nakaarna
 And that's why i will not pursue these questions of inquiry beyond this level

 In Maharashtra, the 25-year-old bjp-shiv Sena and the second 15-year-old congress-ncp alliance are lagging behind
 rajya main 15 oktober ko vot padane he, lekin ab tak gathbandhan sahyogiyon main siton kaa batwaaraa nahin hua he
 This time the BJP is seeking 135 seats out of 288 assembly seats
 vahiin shivasena pehle kii tarah sirf 119 dene ko taiyaar he
 Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray has said clearly and clearly for the first time that he cannot give so many seats
 donon gathbandhano main siton ko lekar matbhed to he hi, mukhyamantri pad ko lekar bhi kaduvaahat he
 Today there was a meeting of bjp's Maharashtra in-charge Rajiv Pratap Rudy and Uddhav Thackeray, which did not happen
 is baar shivasena mukhyamantri pad chaahati he
 Uddhav Thakare wants this post for himself
 maharashtra main shivasena ko bijepi kaa bada bhai mana gaya, lekin ab halaat badal chuke hai
 In the 2009 elections, BJP won more seats than Shiv Sena
 bijepi ne 119 main se 46 siten jeetin, to vahiin 160 siton par ladi shivasena ne 44 par jeet darj kiya
 Because of this, the post of Leader of Opposition also went to BJP
 ab centre main bijepi kii sarkaar he
 There is a wave of Narendra Modi
 aise main bijepi maharashtra main apni bhoomika badalanaa chaahati he
 a few days ago, on the call of Uddhav Thackeray, Amit Shah had come to meet him, did not go by himself
 ye saaf he ki bijepi ko gopinath munde ke guzarane kaa bada jhatka laga tha
 BJP was trying to project him like CM Candidate
 unke jane se ab bijepi main mukhyamantri pad ke liye kai daavedaar khadey ho gaye hai
 The problem is more for the BJP
 nitin gadakari ne ek baar uddhav kii jagah raaj thakare ko tawvajo de di thi
 Then there was so much uproar about it that he had to pull back his steps
 ek samay narendra modi or raaj thakare kii karibiyon kii charchaa bhi thi
 Now on September 17, BJP President Amit Shah is reaching Mumbai for a concrete conversation
 yahaan vah uddhav se bhi mil sakate hai
 On 18 and 19, they have separate meetings in Maharashtra
 udhar congress ensipi main bhi tanaav he
 Sometime ago, Ajit Pawar has advocated to split the seats in half
 saal 2009 main congress 170 par ladi thi or 82 jiti thi
 NCP fought at 113 and won 62
 haal hi main sharad pavaar ne pradhanmantri narendra modi kii tarif bhi kii thi
 The news of their secret meeting was also discussed
 unke paala badalane kii khabar chali thi
 Now even though the congress-ncp body language is being speculated to be defeated, Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan's clean image gives some relief
 bhale hi congress ko isse zyada phayda na ho, lekin shivasena ke uddhav thakare ne aaj saamana main siem par waar kar kaha ki vah isiu main ek marij kii tarah hai
 Work in half sleep
 unako koi anubhav nahin tha, sirf sonia gandhi kii krupa se siem pad mila
 Now the coming days will tell which parties involved in these alliances will be able to share their seats

 Chhattisgarh Pradesh Congress President Bhupesh Baghel is engaged in digging the root of the BJP in the state, as fast as the CBI is busy trapping his arrest
 sibiai kii taiyaariyon ko lekar andaja lagaaya ja saktaa he ki bhupesh baghel ke liye nayaa saal pareshaaniyaan lekar aayega
 The CBI has also prepared a questionnaire to question him
 isamen shaamil lagbhag pandrah sawaal aise hai jo kathith darty sidi kii bhoomika se lekar uske jari hone tak se jude hai
 CBI is trying to find out whether Bhupesh Baghel has any role in the making of this CD
 haalanki, bhupesh baghel pehle din se saaf kar chuke hai ki janpratinidhi or mukhya vipakshi dal ke netaa hone ke chalate kai log unhen bhrashtachar or satta paksh ke netaaon ke kaale karnaamon ke saboot saunpte hai
 So that strict action can be taken against them
 baghel yah bhi kah chuke hai ki is darty sidi ko aise hi kisi shaks ne unke alaava kai or mahatvapurn vyaktiyon ko saunpa tha
 It also includes journalists
 haalanki baghel ke in tathyon par sibiai kitna bharosa karegi yah to baghel ke adhikrut javaabon se pataa chalegaa
 On October 27, at the Civil Line Police Station in Raipur, the state PWD Minister Rajesh Munat filed a case under section 67A of the IT Act against Bhupesh Baghel and journalist Vinod Verma
 yah dhara electronic madhyam se ashleel saamagree rakhane or vitarit karne se judy he
 He had accused Baghel of calling the press conference and distributing the alleged sex CD
 iske alawa ek anya maamla PWD mantri rajesh munat ke kareebi prakaash bajaj kii shikaayat par raipur ke pandari thane main darj kiya gaya tha
 The case registered on October 26 is related to blackmailing and threatening, in which journalist Vinod Verma was arrested
 haalanki donon hi maamalon ko lekar chhattisgarh police or uski esaiti sawaalon ke ghere main he
 On the other hand, Chhattisgarh Pradesh Congress President Bhupesh Baghel seems mentally prepared for his arrest
 unhone kaha ki wo jaanch main purna sahyog karenge
 During the conversation, he alleged that the Chhattisgarh government wanted to implicate him under a conspiracy to weaken the Congress
 unhone kaha ki is maamle main sibiai ko un tathyon par bhi gaur karnaa chahie jis makasad se mantri kii kathith sex sidi kisi shaks ne banaai
 According to him, Minister Rajesh Moonat has made a large amount of wealth by staying in power
 unhen is baat kaa andeshaa he ki bijepi ke kai bade netaaon kii aapasi dushmani or pratispardhaa ke chalate sex sidi saamne aayi he
 According to him, the CBI would have to expand the scope of its investigation
 tabhi is maamle kii hakeekat saamne aegi
 Half a dozen officers of the CBI are busy in carrying out the dirtycd scandal
 unhone chhattisgarh police se cese diary or ab tak hui donon hi maamalon kii puri vivechna apane haathon main le lee he
 It is being studied deeply
 jeudicial remand main raipur central jail main band patrkaar vinod verma se poochtacha ke liye do darjan se zyada prashnon kii soochi bhi taiyaar kar lee gai he
 The CBI will also interrogate those who have recorded their statements to the SIT as witnesses regarding the Dirty CD scandal
 nae sire se in gavaahon se poochtacha karne kaa faisla bhi liya gaya he
 It is being told that CBI can make Delhi resident and CD shop operator Ishu Narang and Bhilai resident Vijay Bhatia a public witness in this entire case
 iske peeche tathy diya ja rahaa he ki unki gavaahi se maamla adaalat main pukhta taur par sabit ho jayega
 On the other hand, it has been 50 days since the arrest of journalist Vinod Verma, so the CBI has only ten days left to present the challan in this case
 jis teji se sibiai is puure maamle ko lekar apana jaal bun rahi he, or yadi paristhitiya anukool rahi to andaja lagaaya ja saktaa he ki 22 se 24 taarikh ke bich wo adaalat main chaalaan pesh kar degi
 At present, the eyes of the people are on the steps of the CBI
 sibiai chhattisgarh police or uski esaiti kii puri vivechna par hi apni muhar lagaaegi yaa phir nae sire se jaanch kar hakeekat tak pahonchegi
 It has to be seen

 Officials said no one was injured in the blasts

 pradhanmantri modi ke vaade ke mutabik agle kuch din main notebandi ke 50 din puure hone ko hai
 With the start of the new year, the old notes of 500 and 1000 will be mere pieces of paper
 lekin sawaal ye uthta he ki kya ek aam insaan ke liye 2 hajaar kaa note kharch karnaa itnaa aasaan hoga?aaj tak kii team ne dilli ke alag-alag ilaakon main jaakar 2 hajaar ke note ko kharch karne kii koshish karke reality check kiya
 First went to an ITO ATM
 jahaan 2 hajaar kaa nayaa note mila or yahi note lekar chhole kulche ke thele par pahunche
 Vishnu, who has been selling Chole Kulche for the last 30 years, refused to give Chole Kulche when he gave a 2000 note
 vishnu ne bataaya ki dinabhar main kai log dukaan main aise aate hai jo 2000 kaa note dete hai lekin chuttay na hone kii vajah se khaanaa nahin khilaa pate
 After this, he traveled in an auto from Jhandewalan to Connaught Place
 apane paas2 hajaar kaa notahone kii isaki auto chaalak ko nahin di, taaki auto vaala hamen le jane se manaa na kar de
 When Connaught Place arrived, a bill of about 50 rupees was made
 lekin jaise hi auto driver ko 2000 kaa note diya usne khule dene se saafe inkaar kar diya
 The auto driver told that many people bring 2000 notes during the day, due to which the subscription is ending
 dilli ke dil conot place main sukhbir singh kaa parivaar2000 ke notese pakora kharid rahaa tha
 Sukhbir said that he has to buy 4 plates for his family, but the shopkeeper does not have open money
 sukhbir singh kaa kahana he ki sarkaar ko pehle 500 kaa note zyada se zyada market main laana chahie tha taaki bade note ko aasaani se kharch kiya ja sake
 It is not that it is difficult to get 2000 rupees open but still small traders have suffered big loss from this big note
 2000 kaa note ek badalte desh kii tasviir ho saktaa he lekin sarkaar ke liye ye zaruri he ki chote note kii taadaat ko badhaayaa jaae taaki bada note logon ke liye musiibat na bane

 The ATM she is going to has to return empty handed
 kai ilaakon se padtaal ke baad ye saafe he ki atm main cash na hona logon ke liye ek badi mushkil ban rahaa he
 Contrary to the government's claim, atms have failed to meet the cash crunch despite 46 days of demonetisation

 peeth ke paanch jajon main chif justise deepak mishra ke alaava chaar or jaj hai, jinamein aaref nariman, eem khanvilakar, divai chandrachud or indu malhotra shaamil hai

 haalanki, centre ne is sunwaayee ke dauraan samalangik vivaahon, algebiticu samudaay ke dattak grahan or anya naagarik adhikaar jaise muddon par gaur nahin karne kaa anurodh kiya he
 Update of Thursday's hearing- Chief Justice Deepak Mishra said that even though the Center left the issue to us, we will do a detailed analysis of the constitutionality of 377
 centre ke kisi mudde ko khulaa chhod dene kaa matlab ye nahin he ki use nyaayik paimaane par dekha nahin jayega
 - Justice Chandrachud said that how can you call it u turn
 centre ne 2013 ke faisle ke khilaaf apil nahin kii thi
 - Justice AM Khanwilkar said - This is not a U-turn
 niztaa ke adhikaar ke baad ab is maamle ko bhi court ke vivek par choda gaya he
 On behalf of the petitioners, Shyam Dewan said that LGBT is seen as criminals
 - yachikakartaon ke vakil ashok desai ne supreme court kii bench se kaha ki samalangikta bhartiya samskruti ke liye nai nahin he
 Many countries have accepted homosexuality

 - Indus Malhotra, a woman judge on the bench of five judges, said that due to family and social pressure, the LGBT community is forced to dispute a person of the opposite sex

 Additional Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Central Government, presented the affidavit in this hearing on Wednesday
 centre sarkaar ne kaha ki dhara 377 par supreme court apane vivek se faisla le
 The Center said that the Supreme Court should ensure the prevention of violence and exploitation against children and do not give any decision on marriage or live-in among homosexuals
 iske alaava kaha gaya ki pashuon ke saath yaa sage sambandhiyon ke saath yon sambandh banane kii ijaajat nahin honi chahie
 To this, Chief Justice of India Deepak Mishra said that the matter could not be confined to homosexuality and lead to a debate like consenting work done among adults
 justise chandrachud ne kaha ki ham yon vyavhaaron ke bare main nahin kah rahe
 We want that if two gay marines are walking on the drive with each other, they should not be arrested
 yachikakartaon kii ore se aidwocket meneka gurusvaami ne kaha ki lesbian, ge, bikeexual or transgender desh ke samvidhan or supreme court se suraksha paane ke adhikari hai
 Section 377 prohibits the LGBT community from equal opportunity and participation
 dhara 377 se langik alpsankhyakon ke raajnneetik or saamaajik adhikaron kaa hanan ho rahaa he
 He said that homosexuality does not affect one's career or progress
 samalangikon ne civil sarvice kamishan, iaiti or duusari sheersh pratiyogi parikshaayen paas kii hai
 On this, Deepak Mishra asked whether there is any rule that prevents homosexuals from giving jobs? Maneka gave the example that discrimination against LGBT is such that the notary refused to sign the petitioner's affidavit
 iske baad vishakhapattanam se sin karaae gaye
 On this, Deepak Mishra said that if this had been told to us, we would have been signed from here
 supreme court ne tippanee main kaha ki samalangikta ko aparaadh kii shrenee se baahar kar dene ke baad algebiti samudaay ke log bina kisi pareshaani or sankoch ke chunaavon main hissaa le sakenge
 With this, the society of the country will be inspired to help the people of LGBT community and these people will also be able to live their lives with gaiety
 (photo- mohsin)mangalvaar ko kya hua sunwaayee menyachikakartaon kii ore se pesh hue arvind daataar ne kaha ki 1860 kaa samalangikta kaa code bharat par thopa gaya tha

 This cannot be called against nature
 yon rujhaan or langik pahchaan donon samaan rup se kisi kii prakritik pravriti ke tathy hai
 The only judge in the bench Indu Malhotra said that homosexuality is seen not only in men but also in animals
 vah daataar ke samalangita ko saamaanya or ahimsak bataane or maanviya youniktaa kaa ek rup bataane par tippanee kar rahi thim
 Additional Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Central Government, said that this case should be limited to Section 377
 iskaa uttaradhikaar, shaadi or sambhog ke maamalon par koi asar nahin padana chahie
 To this, Chief Justice Deepak Mishra remarked that this case is only connected with the validity of Section 377
 iskaa shaadi yaa duusare naagarik adhikaron se lenaa-dena nahin he
 That debate is the second
 purv atorni general mukul rohtagi yachikakartaon kii ore se pesh hue
 He said, 'with the introduction of Section 377, the LGBT community feels itself an undeclared criminal
 samaaj bhi inhen alag najar se dekhtaa he
 The case of sexual instinct is also different from choice
 yah prakritik hoti he
 It comes into being as a human being
 pashchimi duniya main is vishay par shodh hue hai
 The reasons for such sexual instincts are hereditary
 dhara 377 'prakritik' yon sambandh ke bare main baat karti he
 Homosexuality is also natural, it is not unnatural
 'rohtagi ne kaha, 'samaaj ke badalane ke saath hi naitiktaayen badal jaati hai
 We can say that 160 years old moral values will not be today's moral values
 british upniveshvaadiyon ke 1860 ke naitik mulyon se prakritik sex ko paribhaashit nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 The morality of ancient India was different from that of Victorian morality
 'atorni general or jetali kii raay sarkaar se alagais maamle main kendriya mantri arun jetali or atorni general keke venugopal ne sarkaar se alag raay jaahir kii he
 Therefore, Venugopal will not favor the Center during the hearing in the Supreme Court
 unhonesunwaayeese khud ko alag kar liya he
 Venugopalan said, 'now the opinion of the government is different from what the government had said
 isliye main is maamle main supreme court kii samvidhan peeth ke saamne pesh nahin ho rahaa hum
 By the way, my Additional Solicitor General Tushar Mehta has had a very serious discussion on arguments and arguments along with technical and legal aspects of the issue
 'kendriya mantri arun jetali pehle hi dhara 377 ko hataane kii vakaalat kar chuke hai
 Jaitley had said in 2015 that the Supreme Court should reconsider Section 377 of the IPC
 unhone kaha ki supreme court ko samalangikta ke maamle main dilli hoicourt kaa faisla nahin badalanaa chahie tha
 He said that people around the world are adopting different sexual orientations
 aise main kisi ko sexual relations ke aadhaar par jail bhejnaa bahut purana khyaal lagata he

 co / ynjjkrhwwn— ANI (@ani)may 24, 2019 The Delhi government suffered a setback from the High Court in the fight for rights with the Center and now the opposition is trying to surround the government with allegations
 dilli vidhansabha main vipaksh ke netaa vijendra gupta ne kaha ki sarkaar hai court main haari hui ladaai lard rahi thi or is ladaai par vakeelon kii fouj khadi karne main kegerival sarkaar ne karodon rupee kharch kar die
 Sarkar Gupta is blowing money on the fees of lawyers, the Delhi government alleged that in the case filed by the Central Government to cancel the notification of the Central Government, in addition to the government lawyers, well-known private lawyers were also appointed to be the side of the government
 The fees used to be lakhs of rupees for each hearing
 gupta ne kaha ki sarkaar ko in paison kaa hisaab dena hoga, lekin kejariwal sarkaar janata ke paison kii barbaadi ke is khel ko chupaane main juty he
 Vijender Gupta had asked for the details of expenditure
 Vijender Gupta has also issued three letters in support of his allegations
 ye wo patr hai, jinamein vipaksh ke netaa ke taur par unhone dilli ke mukhya sachiv se jaankaree maangi thi ki dilli sarkaar ke mukademon main kitne privet vakeelon kii sevaayen lee gayi hai or unhen kitna bhugtan kiya gaya he
 According to Vijendra Gupta, he wrote the first letter on 3 May 2016, in response to which the chief secretary told him that his letter had been sent to the concerned department, but then no response came to him
 kaam karne kii nahin he sarkaar kii manshagupta ne iske baad june or agast main do din pehle phir mukhya sachiv ko chitthee likhi he, jisamen unhone ye bhi likhaa he ki sarkaar jaanboojhkar vakeelon ko kiye gaye bhugtan kii jaankaree chupa rahi he
 According to Gupta, the intention of the Delhi government is not to do development work, but it is spoiling the time in confrontation with the center and in the court cases
 isiilie vakeelon par khub kharchaa kiya ja rahaa he
 He said that the remuneration of the Delhi Government Standing Council and panel lawyers has been increased by about 600 per cent
 bhram failaane kaa lagaaya aaropagupta ne yah bhi aarope lagaaya he ki dilli sarkaar or aam aadmi party ab hoicourt ke faisle ko lekar logon ke bich bhram failaa rahi he ki bijli-pani kii samasya ke liye bhi logon ko ab alji ke paas janaa hoga
 The people of Delhi have chosen these people to serve Delhi, for development works, but instead of working for the betterment of Delhi, they are running away from their responsibility by creating confusion among the people

" ' unhone kaha, 'yah dhamkiyaan pakistan ko aatmaraksha ke adhikaar ke prayog kaa paryaapt aadhaar muhaiyaa karaati hai
 Lodhi's statement is believed to be a response to Indian Army Chief Bipin Rawat's remarks in which he warned Pakistan last month on the occasion of the anniversary of the 2016 surgical strike against militants on the Pakistani soil
 ravat ne kaha tha, 'strike sandesh se badhkar thi jo ham dena chaahate the or jarurat padane par ise phir se anjaam diya ja saktaa he

 is maamle main tejasvi yadav ne twit karke siem nitish kumaar or dipti siem susheel modi par hamalaa kiya tha
 Tejaswi had said that Honorable Chief Minister, what is happening in my Bihar? film kaa naam : pettakalakaar : rajnikant, navazuddin siddikinirdeshak : karthik subbarajrating: 3
 Karthik Subbaraj, director of 5 Petta film, once told that when Rajinikanth heard the script of the film, he said that somewhere i am the appropriate character for this film
 ' petta ko dekhne ke baad yahi lagata he ki ye puri tarah se rajnikant kii trademark antertaning film he
 The film's director Karthik Subbaraj has left no stone unturned to make it a commercial entertainer
 rajnikant par bharosa jataate hue karthik ek diarector ke taur par bacseet par dikhaai dete hai or 'thaliva' bhi apane phens or apane nirdeshak ko bilkul niraash nahin karte hai
 What is the story of the film? The story of the film begins when Rajinikanth's character Kali joins the college as a hostel ward
 par kaali koi aam insaan nahin balki ek sikret mishan par he
 The twist in the story comes when Kali encounters a UP leader
 netaa kaa kirdaar navazuddin siddiki nibhaa rahe hai
 Vijay Sethupathi plays his son
 hostel wardan 'kaali' ke taur par rajnikant ne behtareen parformens di he
 How is the acting? The film can be seen in Rajinikanth's trademark style and his entertaining style for which the actor is famous all over the country
 hostel ke mess manager ke saath rajnikant ke samvaad behad phani hai
 Apart from this, the chemistry of Rajni and Simran has become fantastic
 navazuddin or vijay setupati ke saath bhi rajnikant ke seens dekhne laayak hai
 'petta' is completely dominated by Thalaivaa and this is reflected in the performance of the rest of the cast
 rajnikant ke saamne navaj kii chamak feeki najar aati he
 The same situation is with Vijay Sethupathi
 ise film kaa ek kamazor paksh bhi kaha ja saktaa he ki nawaz ke kirdaar main gaharaai kii kami he
 Although Rajinikanth handles the film alone
 umdaa cinemetographynational aword se sammanit cinematographer tiru kii cinematography is film main dekhne laayak he
 Apart from this, the level of camera work and production design in the film is also excellent
 film main gane or becoground music bhi kahani ke flo ko barkaraar rakhte hai haalanki ek do jagahon par gane, kahani ko thodaa slo karte hai jo akharata he
 Pongal 2019 is going to be very auspicious and happy for Rajinikanth's fans
 petta rajnikant kii do maheene ke andar duusari film he
 Earlier, he appeared in a political and serious film like Kala
 magar karthik subbaraaj ne rajnikant ke saath ek behad antertaning film kaa nirmaan kiya he jisamen ection, romance, drama, kamedi or imotions kaa dose he or rajnikant ke phens ko is film ko bilkul miss nahin karnaa chahie
 There is good news for users who want to make their smartphone a typewriter
 yuva peedi ke bacchon kii badaulat mobile handsets par typing speed ab physical keybords ke baraabar hoti ja rahi he
 According to a study conducted on 37 thousand users, the difference in typing speed between mobile devices and physical keyboards is decreasing and children aged 10 to 19 are about 10 words-per-minute faster than their parents' generation Can type olto uniwarsity (finland), cambridge uniwarsity or itie jurikh ke shodhakartaaon ne phone or computer donon par hi hajaaron yugers kii typing gati kaa vishleshan kiya
 If you want to type faster on mobile, then researchers recommend using two thumbs for this and enable auto-correction of words
 itie jurikh ke shodhakarta or sah-lekhakon main se ek anna feet ne kaha, "ham yah dekhakar chakit hue ki do anguuthon kii madad se yugers ek minute main ausatan 38 shabd likh lete hai
 This is only 25 percent slower than the typing speed we saw in a large-scale study of physical keyboards
 "jabaki physical keyboard par kuch log 100 shabd prati minute tak likh lete hai
 But few people are able to do this by comparison
 adhiktar log 35 se 65 shabd prati minute tak likh pate hai
 The authors of the research predict that as people become less efficient with physical keyboards and that smart methods for keyboards will improve further (such as auto-correction and touch models), the gap will soon be over

 He was called there by Dawood Mohammad, a thriving Gujarati Muslim businessman
 unhone apane ek saathi muslim vyavsaayee ke khilaaf mukadmaa kar rakhaa tha jise ek angrej vakil lard rahaa tha
 Mohammed wanted Gandhi to do a minor work of translation between this chief counsel and him

 He refused to take off his turban and when the magistrate asked him to step out, he got angry and left
 hamen yah to maaloom nahin ki is par mohammad kii kya pratikriya thi, lekin sthaneey akhbaar da nataal edwartizer ne afat aane kii khabar di thi
 Four days later he published a letter from Gandhi in which he had told the newspaper and the white community that wearing a turban in the eyes of an Indian was not an insult but a sign of respect

 He emerged as the self-styled leader of the moral renaissance movement that wanted to reconcile between different religions, in such a way that one would not have to renounce one's faith
 gandhi isai dharm prachaarkon ke prati aakarshith hue, jinhone unki spasht gambhirtha se mugdh hokar unhen isai banane kii koshish kii
 Gandhi responded cleverly - Since all the principles of Christianity are already present in Hinduism, he sees no reason to leave his religion

 Gandhi also made his followers among the traditionally divided people, especially Hindus and Muslims, on the basis of divisive lines of religion
 islam ke khalipha osmania sultan ke liye musalamaanon ke man main kitni izzat he, iskaa pataa unhen tab chalaa jab unhone istambul main satta parivartan ke maukey par musalamaanon kii ore se unhen badhai patr likhaa
 And he remembered this even when he included Muslims in the national movement during the non-cooperation movement
 jaisaa ki unhone baad main kaha, ''dakshin africa main hindu musalmaan samasya sulajh gai he
 We realized that without each other their work could not work
 ''unhone apane moulik vichaaron ko prachaarit karne ke liye 1903 main indian opinian shuru kiya
 There was no original idea more than satyagraha
 yah ek bilkul moulik rajnatik vichaar tha,jise unhone ''satya kaa aagrah'' bataaya or ''shantipurna pratirodh'' ko ati shantipurna bataate hue khaarij kar diya
 Satyagraha was first used in 1908 against the immigration law, which he condemned as the "black law"
 jaahir he, unhen apane chaaron ore faile shwet naslwad ke bainks vidambnaa kaa abhas nahin tha
 His slogan was dramatic - do or die! When he started Satyagraha in 1919, it had a direct resonance in it
 is andolan se itihaas ke sabase shaktishaalee samrajya ke patan kii ulti ginati shuru hone vaali thi
 He opposed the Rowlatt Law, which insulted Indians, although he fought for the British Empire during the First World War in the battlefields of Europe and Africa (in which Gandhi himself was actually a recruiting sergeant)
 gandhi ne use ''kaala kanoon'' kaha
 He made the Khilafat movement against Indian Muslims a part of the national movement for independence
 bharatiyon ko unka sandesh janapahachaanaa thah karo yaa maro! unka hathiyaar'satyagrah' tha, ek ahimsak shastr, jo dakshin africa main apni dhundhlisi shuruyaat ke baad dhiredhire, adrishy kadamon ke saath ajey hota chalaa gaya
 When he said goodbye to South Africa for the last time in 1914, his opponent Jan Christian Smuts, who was the government's chief guide and later became a friend of British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, said, "that saint has departed from our beach, i believe he is gone forever

 To those who had come to see him off, Gandhi placed his hand on Kallenbach's shoulder and said, "I am not taking my European brother with me, but my European brother
" '' donon bhai bharat main thik usee tarah bas janaa chaahate the,jis tarah ve 1908 se dakshin africa main saath rah rahe the
 If luck had not turned it, they would have succeeded in their intention
 pratham vishwayuddh shuru hone ke agle hi din ve landan pahunche, or gandhi kii apilon ke baavjood ek german ko koi bhi passport nahin jari kar sakaa
 Kallenbach was placed in the Isle of Man (the island between Britain and Ireland), and sent to Germany at the time of exchange of prisoners after the war
 phir 1937 tak unki mulaakaat nahin hui
 Gandhi was reminded of his brother, and once during the Khilafat Movement he said, "I have no Callenbach!" Joseph Lelyveld in his new book Great Soul described this relationship with some detail
 It is that he has made his journey in the world familiar to Gandhi pass through a trot in a street
 yah bataanaa jaruri he ki purv patrkaar leliveld ne, jo saath ke dashak main dakshin africa or bharat main samvaadadaata the or neuyork times ke managing editor ke pad se sevanivrutt hue,koi nai baat ujagar nahin kii he
 Kallenbach's documents lie in the National Archives of Delhi or Sabarmati Ashram in Gujarat
 usamen kuch bhi gopneey nahin he, or aisa kuch nahin he jise unke samakaleen jeevanikaron ne nahin dekha he
 But others have avoided putting vulgar words, or double words in the saga
 chaar dashakon se yah kitaab leliveld ke 'garbh' main thi
 It is sad that he resorted to gestures or secret motives in a work that could have earned a respectable place in books written on Gandhi
 gandhi main apni kaamuktha ke maamle main gopneeyata se upar uthne kaa adwitiya saahas tha
 He did not need a biography to tell this fact; He has told this through an autobiography, which was published at such an important moment in his life when he was absolutely candid about "experiments with truth"
 vyapak dharna yah he ki angrej hukumat ne, jo gandhi se behad nafrat karti thi, nobel shanti puraskaar se unhen vanchit kara diya; shaayad unhen samajhatakarke gandhi ko 1930 ke dashak main sahitya kaa nobel puraskaar dilaa dena chahie tha, kyonki shaayad hi kisi aatmakatha main itani eemaandaaree ke saath baaten bataai gai hon
 Psychologist and biographer of Gandhi, Eric Erickson, was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 1958 for his indispensable consideration; And other Freudists have praised Gandhi's apparent confession that he was feminine (in his opinion every man has a feminine quality)
 lekin iskaa matlab yah nahin ki gandhi ko samalingi kaha gaya
 Lelyveld has smartly named his chapter on Kallenbach the 'upper House'
 gandhi majaak main apane liye ''apper house'' jumale kaa istemaal karte the or calenbakh ke liye ''loar house'' jumale kaa
 But it is not necessary that everyone interpret 'upper' and 'lower' in the same way that the ruling class of Britain used to do at the Aten playground
 jab gandhi ne 1908 main yon durvyavhaar ke khatre se tharraate hue vah raat guzari thi tab ve calenbakh ke saath rah rahe the
 His personal life had already moved towards impermanence
 agast 1906 main unhone brahmacharya ke paalan kaa pran kiya tha; brahmacharya kaa matlab kamechha se mukti, taaki ve apane logon kii behatar dhang se seva kar saken
 He believed that the loss of semen weakened the man, and that sex caused criminal waste of "vital fluid"
 '' ve shaakaahaari se falahari ban gaye, kyonki unka maananaa tha ki doodh, doodh se bani chizon or masaalon (jo unhen pasand the) main kamoddeepak visheshtaayen hoti hai
 He said that Geeta prevented him from eating for pleasure
 brahmacharya ke baad gandhi kaa koi raaj, raaj nahin rah gaya
 For this reason, they gave up privacy or privacy
 ve daravaaje band karke nahin sote the
 Some of his hobbies for body massage can easily be linked to libido, and there is doubt that Kallenbach has massaged him
 lekin agar har maalish kaamuktha ke liye ho, to aaj kisi bhi spa ko vaid nahin mana jayega
 Gandhi's desire to get massages or his craze for taking enemas continued even after the era of Kallenbach
 unka ek paksh yah tha ki ve manshaa kii ashuddhta samet aantarik ashuddhta ke liye khud ko dandit karte the
 For this reason, he also conducted gold experiments with young women under his experiment with truth
 yah us mahatma kaa aatmanushasan tha, jisane apane antarman ko ubaau aadambar ke parade se dhakne se inkaar kar diya
 Kallenbach was not the first European to live in Gandhi's house
 1904 main gandhi kii mulaakaat ek 24 varshiya patrkaar henry polak se hui, jo unheen kii tarah shaakaahaari the or tolastoy ke prashansak the
 In 1905, Polak lived in Gandhi's large bungalow in Troyville, an expensive area
 polak ne shaadi kar lee, shaayad isliye un par us tarah dhyaan nahin diya gaya
 But it should be noted that after the marriage of Polak couple, Gandhi joined them and separated from Polak only after having a child
 uske baad hi ve calenbakh ke saath rahane lage
 Kallenbach wrote a letter to his brother Simon, who was living in Germany at the time, about Gandhi's influence
 unhone likhaa ki ve do saal pehle hi shaakaahaari ban gaye the, or 18 maheene pehle sex chhod diya
 He emphasized Gandhi's restrained diet: chocolate means death
 yah daleel di ja sakati he ki sex ke lop ke chalate donon ko apane bhaichaare, yaa shaayad samalingi prem main dwiarthi shabdon se nijaat mil gai
 Kallenbach's body texture promotes this gossip
 ve jimnast the, or gandhi ne ek baar kaha tha ki unhen antarrashtriya superstar bodyilder ujin sando ne prashikshit kiya he
 Gandhi was around 110 pounds and five feet seven inches, which is not at all like Hercules
 unhone pyaar kii bhashaa kaa istemaal kiya, ve itane kareeb the ki ek din main ek saath 21 mile paidal chalate the, or calenbakh gandhi kii shuruaati kitaab hind swaraj kii pandulipi padhane vaale pehle vyakti the
 But Gandhi continued to spend more time on persuading her that she lived in poverty rather than living in Bhogavilas
 meri apni raay he ki gandhi, jo is aparadhbodh se kabhi nahin ubar paae kibgal ke kamare main jab pita maut se jujh rahe the tab ve apni patni kasturba ke saath pyaar main duube the, kisi premi kii jagah kisi ishdoot main zyada dilchaspee lete the
 He was an apostle in the sense that the word Dharmadoot can have the best meaning

 This time there are some indications of whether Ravi Kishan is feeling any kind of cognizant differences when he contested from BJP and entered the election field as a Congress last time

 The victory enthused both former Chief Ministers Mayawati and Akhilesh Yadav, who have come together to stop the bjp's rout in the state, forgetting their permanent enmity
 tark diya gaya ki agar gorakhpur jeeta ja saktaa he to bijepi ke adhikaar vaali duusari jagahon ko bhi hasil kiya ja saktaa he
 Yogi Adityanath, who termed the mayawati-akhilesh alliance as a disastrous alliance like snake and mongoose during the floods, had to accept that he underestimated the combined strength and public mood of his enemies
 janata ke haathon mili is sajaa ke baad vah gorakhpur kii dasha sudhaarney ke liye nikal pade, jisamen sadakon kaa chaudeekaran, nae khaad plant or chini mil kii sthapana shaamil he
 The Prime Minister chose Gorakhpur instead of his parliamentary constituency Varanasi to initiate basic schemes worth Rs 10 thousand crore for Purvanchal and announced the Prime Minister Kisan Samman Nidhi (pm-kisan) of Rs 75 thousand crore, under which the accounts of small farmers 6 thousand rupees will be directly transferred every year
 raajnneetik vishleshak manoj singh vikaas kii is bayaar se kaaphi khush hai
 According to him, "development has never played a major issue in Gorakhpur elections
 agar aisa hota to sarkari aspataalon kii durdasha yaa kamjor pulon or yatayaat ke sadhano ke abhaav kii gunj yahaan ke logon main sunai detii
 In the last elections, the public has either voted Gorakhnath temple or given a mandate based on casteist equations
 "behad jatil jativaadee sanrachana vaale gorakhpur main 20 lakh voter hai, jisamen nishad jati ke sabase zyada (2
 63 lakh voters)
 iske baad duusare number par dalit (2
 6 lakh voters) and then Yadav (2
 40 lakh voter) hai
 a large number of people of these castes and Muslim voters supported Akhilesh Yadav candidate Pravin Nishad in the 2018 by-election
 praveen nishad sthaneey sanghathan 'nishad' ke netaa bhi hai
 a local leader of Akhilesh Yadav's party reportedly says, "after Pravin Nishad's victory, the Nishad Party became ambitious and demanded two Lok Sabha tickets, which Akhilesh Yadav rejected
 " april kii shuruyaat main nishad party ne kaha tha ki wo bijepi ke saath gathbandhan kar legi
 This so-called plan to join the BJP was created by Shivpal Yadav, a rebel uncle of Akhilesh Yadav
 lekin bijepi jaanati thi ki agar usne kisi nishad ko apana ummidavaar banaaya to vah gorakhpur ke kareeb 7
 Will lose 5 lakh upper caste voters, most of whom are Brahmins
 isliye usne ravi kishan shukla ko apana ummidavaar banaaya
 (praveen Nishad is contesting from the neighboring parliamentary seat
 )yogi adityanath kii hindu yuva vahini ke purv varisht netaa sunil singh kehete hai, "ravi kishan ko sarvasammati se chunaa gaya hoga
 The BJP leadership may have thought that the Brahmin community would be satisfied if it nominated a Brahmin candidate after not giving tickets to its two strong leaders Murali Manohar Joshi and Kalraj Mishra
 ek abhinayta, ek kamjor rajaneta or ek bahari gorakhpur main mukhyamantri ke liye kisi bhi tarah kaa khatra nahin he
 "sunil Singh was separated from his mentor Adityanath after 15 years and now he is campaigning against him
 haalanki 49 saal ke ravi kishan kehete hai ki vah yahaan lambey samay tak tikne ke liye aae hai, "main bina thake logon ke liye kaam karne vaale anti rama raav or vinod khanna jaise gambhir netaaon kii tarah paripakv hona chahta hum
 "reiterating PM Modi's promise in the year 2014, he says that he plans to make a Bhojpuri film studio which will create 1 lakh jobs
 gathbandhan ummidavaar rambhual nishad ne enditivi se kaha ki unhen is baat kii koi chintaa nahin he ki ek star pratidwandi ke saamne unki chamak feeki pad jaaegi
 He said, "I have the support of the deprived sections of society belonging to all castes and religions
 " kuch nishad party ke samarthak kehete hai ki vah rambhual ko vot denge kyonki praveen nishad ko party main shaamil karne ke baad bhi bijepi ne unhen unki pasand kii seat gorakhpur se chunaav nahin ladane diya
 Sunil Oja, who is handling the 2019 elections in Varanasi and Gorakhpur, the prime minister's parliamentary constituency, claims that non-bjp parties are giving the highest importance to caste and religion
 unke mutabik, "ve in sabhi jatiyon ke logon ko nazarandaaj kar rahi hai jo vikaas ke liye vot dengi
 Dalits and Muslims have benefited the most from welfare schemes
 "yogi adityanath kaa ghar gorakhpur hameshaa se viipi ilaaka rahaa he
 This time it has become more important than before because it is here that the most unimaginable political nexus of mayawati-akhilesh Yadav was born

 There is news of relief for railway passengers
 ab unhen apane safar ke liye kam paise kharch karne honge
 This is because the tax rate has been reduced on the food received from the railways
 haalanki, is suvidha kaa zyada laabh un train yatriyon ko hi mil paaegaa, jinamein tikat ke saath hi khaane ke paise bhi dene hote hai
 In fact, recently the Finance Ministry had issued an order that the same rate of GST be applied to food and beverages found on trains and platforms
 jiske baad sabhi mail or express trainon main khaane-pine kii chizon par 5 fisadi jiesti lagu kar diya gaya tha
 Whereas in Rajdhani, Shatabdi and Duronto this system has come into force from 16 April
 jabaki ab tak yahaan khaane-pine ke saamaan par 18 fisadi jiesti vasula ja rahaa tha
 More benefit to the passengers of Rajdhani, Shatabdi and Duronto, in fact, the most benefit of this new system will be available only to travelers traveling in Rajdhani, Shatabdi and Duronto
 kyonki in trainon main safar karne vaale yatriyon ko tikat booking ke vakt khaane kaa paisa bhi dena hota he
 Till now, 18 percent GST was being levied on the food items available in these trains, which has now come down to five percent
 yani ab yatriyon ko tikat ke saath food items par lagane vaale tex main sidhe taur par 13 fisadi tex kii bachat hogi
 Which will make them lower ticket price than before
 ye he nai rate listis raahat ke baad rajdhani, shatabdi or duranto main first asi or agxcutive chair car main naashtaa 90 rupee main mil jayega
 While it will be available for Rs 70 in a chair car including second class AC and third class AC
 jabaki duranto ke sleeper main 40 rupee main naashtaa mil jayega

 6 june, 2014 kii garm dopaher main meri car muradabad se kareeb 30 kilometre dur kanth kasbe kii taraf bad rahi thi
 There was a beautiful view of greenery on both sides of the road
 kai kisaan bagichon se aam tod rahe the
 a large town appeared in front of it, when approaching, the police were seen on the road and the police were patrolling
 kai pulisavaale gamchaa lapete gapshap kar rahe the
 His lips were ruddy red from the pan
 sannaate se bhare bazaar main aage badhata ja rahaa tha
 Big locks were hanging on the shutters of the shops
 aise laga, jaise puraa kasbaa khamosh he
 Standing the car and talked to many people
 ek adhivaktaa jo court se lautaa tha, mere camere or mike kii jad main aa gaya, bolaa, "9 din se yah bazaar band he
 
 
 Badrange's business has stalled here
 
 
 puure shahar main kahin bhi aapako doodh yaa sabji nahin milegi, ab yaa to laudspikar mili, nahin to ye shahar aise hi band rahegaa"
 It was learned that information is causing a loss of about 50 lakh rupees every day due to the closure of hundreds of shops in the town
 ek din pehle hi yahaan bijepi kaaryakartaaon or police main jabardast bhidnt hui thi, jisamen ilaake ke dm chandrakant samet 20 log ghayal ho gaye the
 Many BJP mps and mlas were arrested even before coming to Kantha
 giraftaar honen waalon main mujfnagar dangon ke aaropee sangeet som bhi the
 At the same time, police arrested 63 people on charges of spreading nuisance
 giraftaar logon kaa aarope tha ki un par thane main raat bhar danda chale
 All this was a side effect of the same silent loudspeaker
 kanth se ek kilometre dur akbarpur chendri gaanv main 'laudspikar mahoday' se milane main bhi gaya
 There was silence in the streets of the village
 gaadi kii aawaaj sunakar kuch log daravaaje se jhanke or phir daravaaje band ho gaye
 Mahant Hoshiranath was sleeping on his bed in a small Shiva temple
 mandir ke saamne police hi police thi
 i shook the Mahant, with alasai eyes he sat on the bed
 mike lagaaya, to bole, "pulisavaale aae or jabaran mandir ke upar laga lidespikar nikaal diya, jabaki ye laudspikar 14 saal se laga hua tha"
 This village is 80 percent Muslim, while 20 percent is Hindu
 police ke mutabik gaanv ke logon main samjhauta hua tha ki mandir main janmashtami or mahashivaratri par hi laudspikar bajegaa
 This was going on for many years, but this time Mahant took off the loudspeaker, but on 16 June, BJP MP from Moradabad, Sarvesh Singh again got a new loudspeaker installed
 isaki shikaayat gaanv ke duusare samudaay ne jab police se kii, to police ection main aa gai or laudspikar hataa diya gaya
 Talking like a Samajwadi Party spokesperson, Moradabad SSP Dharmendra Yadav claims, “BJP is trying to spoil the atmosphere here
 
 
 ye sab sarvesh singh ke ishaare par ho rahaa he or ye isliye ho rahaa he kyonki thakurdwara vidhansabha kshetra main upachunaav hone hai"
 The question is that when the police knew the story of the entire conspiracy, then why was action not taken against these leaders
 esaspi ko itnaa pataa he, lekin ye pataa nahin ki unke ilaake main esadm koun he
 During the uproar, the SSP lashed out at the SDM of the area present in the crowd and then continued to speak 'sorry-sorry', saying no identification later
 khayr, ilaake ke saansad sarvesh singh se mila
 The MP said, "I have nothing to do with this matter
 
 
 main to akbarpur chendri gaanv 30 saal se gaya hi nahin"
 Amazing, Sarvesh ji has been an MLA many times, became an MP and has not been to the village for 30 years! Must have gone to ask for votes saaf dikh rahaa tha ki ye puraa maamla har kisi ke liye ek raajnneetik agenda he
 'samajwadi' for police and administration as well as for BJP
 prashasan chahta, to baatcheet ke jariye gaanvvaalon ko samajha-bujhaakar maamle ko vahiin khatm kar saktaa tha
 However, the police claim that no person from the village was involved in the uproar, those arrested were also people from outside the town
 meraa maananaa he ki kai maamle kanoon se upar hote hai, khaastaur se aasthaa or dharm se jude maamle or aise maamalon main sanyam or baatcheet se hi aage badha ja saktaa he
 Gradually, the situation has become normal here, but for some people the issue is still alive, in such a silent loudspeaker can speak anytime

 Former Governor of Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Raghuram Rajan believes that demonetisation in November 2016 was the main reason for the decline in growth rate in India
 rajan ne kaha, "main samajhataa hum ki abhi kisi nishkarsh par nahin pahunchaa ja saktaa
 We will continue to argue that this has increased tax compliance until the previous tax collection figures are reached
 isliye is bare main abhi kisi nishkarsh par nahin pahunchaa ja saktaa
 i suspect that the reason for the decline in growth rate is its (demonetisation) effect
 
 It also had an impact on the informal economy, which could not be immediately caught, as we are seeing
 vyapaar band ho rahe hai, kyonki ve isse ubar nahin sake
 "wait to understand the benefits of demonetisation," said Raghuram Rajan, "to understand the positive impact of demonetisation, we have to wait and see again

 hamane unhen jabaav de diya tha
 But we considered this decision very difficult
 main nahin samajhataa tha ki isse vaanchit laabh hoga or isaki laagat bhi kaaphi adhik hone vaali thi
 "read this: PM Modi said from Davos forum, the fifth pillar of globalization is shrinking? Rajan said," Yes, any monetary value ?? The woman will have to say that before the currency is out of circulation Get enough printing done

 kya aapane secha he ki aapke partner ko us samay kaisaa mahasoos hua hoga jab aapane pehali baar unke saamne kapade utaare honge
 Both women and men have many fantasies about their partners
 jab aap apane partner ke saamne pehali baar kapade utaarte hai to unke dimag main kya chalata he isi vishay par sex export terresi cox ne 5-5 poinnt bataae hai
 They say that all of these things can come to your partner's mind and at least one will definitely come
 mahilaayein kya sochati hai:aam taur par wo aapke sharir ko check karti he:mahilaayein bhi purushon kii hi tarah apane partner ke sharir ko ghurti hai
 She can read her partner completely in the eyes
 iskaa yah matlab bilkul nahin he ki agar aapke 6 pack nahin hai to wo aapako bhav nahin dengi
 She starts comparing who will win the Body Beautiful Competition: Women see if their body shape is better than me
 agar aisa he to ye unhen bada chalange lagata he
 Then they feel that i wish i had not eaten all that
 unke pair to mere pairon se bhi zyada shape main hai
 She even starts wondering why men do not hang their bums like women
 wo aapke pennish ke sies ko bhi dekhati hai:iske baad mahilaon kaa dhyaan aapke pennish ke sies kii taraf jaataa he
 But here the matter is a bit opposite, where men tend to take the frustration of being small, while women do not like big size
 is baat main bilkul bhi sachai nahin he ki mahilaayein un purushon ko pasand karti hai, jinka pennish sies bada hota he
 This can sometimes make sex painful and painful
 isliye agar aapkaa pennish everej sies kaa he to aap nishcint rahen
 Even if you feel that your size is small, do not worry
 bas aapaki jubaan acchhee honi chahie
 She sees whether you are excited or not: If you are not getting excited by seeing a nude woman in front of you, then the woman feels that it is her fault
 agar aisa he to aap turant apni mahila partner ko bataaen ki aisa bilkul nahin he ki aap ke man main unke liye bhavanaaen nahin hai
 She sees what is your reaction by seeing them naked? Actually, this is what worries women the most
 sabase acchhee pratikriya mahilaon ko lagati he ki unka partner kaamuktha se unke puure sharir ko dekhe or uske chehre par aise bhav hon ki ab bas
 
 
 What women don't see? There are very few things that women don't notice
 lekin unhen is baat se koi lenaa dena nahin hota ki aapaki peeth main til he yaa nahin
 Which brand of underwear did you wear, which you just removed? aapke sharir par kitne bal hai aadi
 What Men Think: Yahoo
 
 
 ab main sex karuunga!agar aapke saamne ek mahila neude khadi ho to iskaa matlab he aap jald hi uske saath sex karne vaale hai
 Your partner gets elated just thinking about it
 lekin jald hi yah ek alag vichaar main badal jaataa he, jo utana zyada bhi khushnuma nahin hota
 Is my penis size right? Unlike women, the private part of a man soon gets aroused
 isliye liye vah paagalpan main teji se aapke chehre par bhavanaaen dhundne lagata he, jisase use apni is bhranti kaa hal mil sake
 If he feels that he is fine in this matter, then immediately he is surrounded by another doubt
 kya main parform kar paaungaa?mahilaayein dikhaawati kaam vaasana kaa bhi pradarshan kar sakati hai, lekin purush nahin
 If you have sex for the first time, it is very stimulating, but all the pressure is on the man
 wo aapaki breast kii taraf dekhtaa he:in sari baton se paar paane ke baad aakhirkaar uskaa dhyaan us ore jaataa he, jo uske saamne he
 Now comes the time for bra on and bra off tests
 haalanki bra main aapke clivij acchhee or uttejk lagati hai, lekin kya ye sab unamem uttejnaa bharne ke liye kaaphi hai
 Then their attention goes downwards: this is a very special time
 kyonki bhale hi aapane vaix kiya ho, trim kiya, thode-bahut bal rakhe hon yaa puri tarah se saaf kiye hue hon
 You may not already know their choice
 kuch purush chaahate hai ki unke partner kaa privet part bilkul saaf ho, jabaki kuch ko trim pasand hoga
 Then he takes a test of your body confidence: if one of your hands immediately goes up and covers the private part by moving the breast downwards, then it is understood that he is going to get normal sex
 jabaki agar aap aatmavishvaas ke saath bilkul sidhi unke saamne khadi rahati hai to wo aapke bare main sochane lagata he or use lagane lagata he ki usko shandaar anubhav hone vaala he
 Which does not get the attention of the man: During this time the attention of the man does not go on your weight at all
 yahi nahin breast sies ke alaava bhi uskaa dhyaan aapke body sies par nahin jaataa
 As long as you keep Nude standing in front of each other, he starts thinking about what he is going to see
 haa agar uske andar sharaarat he to wo ye jarur dekhnaa chahega ki jab aap walk karti hai to aapke breast or bams uchhalte hai yaa nahin
 Fire Temple Trust Delhi Parsi Anjuman has denied the allegation of discriminating against people of other religions in the Parsi fire temple near Delhi Gate and not allowing them inside the temple

 The court has postponed the hearing for August 26
 parsi agni mandir ne apane jawaab main yah bhi kaha he ki use mandir kii dekhbhaal ke liye kisi se anudaan nahin miltaa he
 They themselves take care of the temple
 aise main koi gaiyr parsi mandir main nahin jane dene kii baat kare to yah galat he
 The court sought a response from the Center and the Delhi government in addition to the Delhi Police and the temple trust in the case on December 21 last year
 yachika lagane vaale vakil sanjeev kumaar ne yachika daakhil kar aarope lagaaya he ki dilli get metro stesan ke paas sthit agni mandir main hinduon, muslimon, sikhon aadi ko mandir ke garbhagrih main pravesh kii anumati nahin he
 It is like spreading racism, untouchability and communalism
 unhone kaha ki ve khud mandir gayi the, lekin unhen garbh grih main nahin jane diya gaya
 Then he came to know about all this
 yachikakarta kaa yah bhi daawa he ki ki mandir ke baahar hi notice laga he jisamen kaha gaya he ki anya dharm ke logon ke agni mandir main pravesh kii ijaajat nahin he
 Only Zoroastrians are allowed in it

 Among them, Dwayne Leverock of Bermuda is not an unknown name for India
 2007 world cap ke dauraan isi vajandaar leverock ne robin uthppa kaa ek yaadgaar kaich pakadaa tha
 After the 127 kg Leverock, now another weighty cricketer is in the headlines on social media these days
 usne haalanki ab tak koi international cricket nahin khelaa he, lekin ummid he jald hi use westeindies team main shaamil kar liya jayega

 loksabhaa chunaav ke paanchaven charan kii voting ke baad uttar pradesh main ab siyaasi ranbhumi kaa maidan purvanchal ban gaya he
 The next two phases will determine the future of power at the center
 aise main bijepi, congress or sapa-basapa gathbandhan ne puri takat lagaae hue hai
 If the ruling BJP is trying to save its fort, then the Congress is trying to make a strong comeback in Purvanchal through a new political equation
 jabaki sapa-basapa gathbandhan ke saamne apane voton ke transfar kii badi chunauti he, jiske chalate akhilesh yadav or mayawati ne donon netaaon ne nai ranneeti banaai he
 Voting is to be held in 27 seats of Uttar Pradesh in the sixth and seventh phase of Lok Sabha elections, out of which BJP got 26 seats and SP got one seat in 2014
 is baar ke loksabhaa chunaav main in siton ke liye sapa pramukh akhilesh yadav or basapa adhyaksh mayawati ne apane-apane votbank ko ek duusare ko transfar karaane ke liye khaas plan banaaya he
 Under this, Akhilesh Yadav has pledged to win the BSP candidate and Mayawati SP candidate
 akhilesh yadav ne badali hui nai ranneeti ke tahat ab un siton par khaas focus kar rahe hai, jahaan basapa ummidavaar chunavi maidan main he
 The SP president has campaigned in favor of the BSP by going alone to seats like Sultanpur, Pratapgarh and Shravasti in the sixth phase
 vahiin, basapa supremon mayawati ne faijabad, barabanki, gonda or baharich jaisi tamaam siton par sapa ummidavaar ke paksh main jaakar prachaar kiya he
 Actually, since the time of formation of SP-BSP alliance in Lok Sabha elections, political pundits were apprehensive about the transfer of votes
 shuruaati daur kii voting trend ko dekhen to sapa-basapa kaa vot ek duusare ko aasaani se transfar hota dikhaa
 But there are many such Lok Sabha seats in the fourth and fifth phase of voting, where both parties have seen a lot of problems in the transfer of votes of SP and BSP
 bundelkhand kii banda loksabhaa seat gathbandhan ke tahat sapa ke khate main gai he, jahaan se shyama charan gupta chunaav maidan main the
 At the same time, RK Patel, who was the BSP candidate in 2014, was beating this time as a BJP candidate
 isi tarah se 2014 main sapa ke ummidavaar rahe bal kumaar patel congress se maidan main the
 In this way, RK Patel worked to get the bsp's voters in his court, then Bal Kumar Patel has tried to connect the sp's vote bank with him
 banda sansadeey seat kii tarah akbarpur loksabhaa seat gathbandhan ke tahat basapa ke khate main gai he
 From here, there are Nisha Sachan election grounds from BSP
 vahiin, aakhri vakt main sapa kaa saath chhodkar mahendra singh yadav pragatisheel samaajawaadee party se utar kar sapa ke votbank ko apane paale main kar liya tha
 Similarly, the SP vote bank of the Fatehpur Lok Sabha seat has not been seen to be transferred, because SP MP Rakesh Sachan was in the electoral fray from the Congress this time
 akhilesh yadav or mayawati ne is baat ko samajhate hi apni ranneeti main badlaav kiya or donon netaa ek saath reliyaan karne ke saath-saath alag-alag siton par vyaktigat taur par jansabhaayen karke apane-apane vot ko transfar karne kii ranneeti banaai he
 In such a situation, it has to be seen how successful this strategy of SP-BSP is

 comjarakamda sangharsh kii tapobhumi he, jiskaa itihaas germany ke us damankaal se thodaa-sa bhi kam nahin he, jisamen taanashaah hitler ne 60 lakh yahudiyon ko maravaaya tha
 Historians have called it a sad chapter of human civilization
 lekin jharkhand main mul bashindon kaa daman thamane kaa naam nahin le rahaa, balki unke shoshan kaa koi namelewa bhi nahin he
 The book by senior journalist Anuj Kumar Sinha documents the same history of exploitation
 europea yatnaa kii yah kahani chah saalon (1933-1939) ke bich kii he, jabaki jharkhand main mul bashindon kii samuhik hatya, daman or shoshan kaa silsilaa 1834 se hi chal rahaa he, jab raniganj main koyale kaa khanan shuru hua
 Before this, whenever the Adivasis erupted, they were pressed
 tab adivasee mahajanee pratha or angrejon ke atikaraman ke khilaaf lamaband hote the
 But the new model of development that emerged from the middle of the 19th century was anti-tribal
 jharkhand main atmabhimaan kii raksha ke liye jab aawaaj uthi use nrushansata ke saath kuchlaa gaya
 Europe has some names like hitler-napoleon, while there are several generations of dictators who colonized Jharkhand internally

 This book is an incomparable saga of the helplessness and bravery of the same original residents
 kitaab kaa har panna hamen baichaiyn karata he
 Anuj not only searches old government documents and books, but also visits related areas
 sheershak se hi spasht he ki shoshan ke liye kiye ja rahe sangharsh kaa nateeja he shahadat, jo thamane kaa naam nahin le rahi
 Thousands of martyrdom writers explore all reality, not in the sky of imagination, but on the rough ground of reality

 Not only the facts, the related photos also confirm those facts
 udhaaharan ke liye 1948 ke kharasavaan golicond main sarkaar ne 35 logon ke marane kii pushti kii thi
 But Anuj collects the documents and p
 ke dev kii pustak ke ek ansh se yah bataate hai ki is golicond main 2,000 log maare gaye the
 On this basis, Anuj calls it another Jallianwala Bagh massacre
 kitaab padhakar aisa lagata he ki desh main nasli safai kaa daur chal rahaa he
 This book is an indication that there is no cost to the martyrdom of the struggling tribals for their resources
 rajya banane ke baad achaanak jo chehre dikhne lage, ve baichaiyn karne vaale the
 The agitating tribals, who raised the voice of 'jaan denge land nahi', are mercilessly killed
 yah kitaab apane aap main ek aisa dastavej he, jo adivasee bharat ke itihaas ko nai disha or aayam detii he
 Along with this, Anuj has been able to prove his commitment to the basic principles of journalism in this book

 Click to watch Aaj Tak LIVE TV Gagan has property worth crores but he does not file income tax returns
 jab gagan se unki sampatti ko lekar baat karne kii koshish kii gai to unhone kuch bhi kehane se manaa kar diya
 But Swami Ramdev has defended Gagan saying that all this is a conspiracy to defame him
 ab baalkrishna ke janmdin ko lekar uthaa vivadaramdev ke sahyogi baalkrishna abhi aaropon ke bhoot se peechha chhudaa hi rahe hai ki unke pie par bhi ungali uth gai
 Balakrishna's PA earns a salary of 10 thousand but his status is that of a millionaire

 What is the reality of 'balakrishna fake degree scandal'? In the last two years, property worth crores was bought in several areas including Kalanjari and Shantarshah in the name of PA Gagan of Balakrishna
 14 may 2010 ko kaalanjri main 7,525 vargametre kaa plot gagan ke naam par 1 karod 37 lakh,35 hajaar rupee main kharida gaya

 Apart from this, it is also important that the stamp duty paid on the purchased plot is according to the circle rate of that place
 jabaki us kshetra kaa bazaar bhav isse kahin adhik he
 Gagan may have bought crores of property in his name, but he does not file income tax returns
 haalanki iskar vibhaag ke sutara bataate hai, gagan ne pan card liya he
 When he tried to talk to Gagan about this, he refused to say anything
 tab morcha baba ramdev ne sambhala
 The sheer wealth associated with the Babas who arouse against corruption is awe-inspiring
 gagan kumaar usee baalkrishna ke pie hai, jo farji certificate kaa aarope jhel rahe hai

 wikileaks wrote on Twitter that an American diplomat in his cables never called Modi a 'non-corrupt' and 'the only honest Indian politician'

 Read on the wikileaks website, what was written in that cable jadeja-anderson vivaad main england ke tej gendbaaj james anderson ko isliye doshi nahin samajha gaya kyonki un par bain lagane ke liye paryaapt saboot nahin the
 Judicial Commissioner Gordon Lewis, appointed by the ICC, has claimed this
 gordan ne anderson ke khilaaf aaropon kii sunwaayee kii thi
 He said that the witnesses themselves were very biased in favor of their team and the only neutral witness (trent Bridge overseer) said that he had not seen much
 iske alaava apmanjanak chhintakashi sabit karne ke liye koi audio saboot bhi nahin tha or na hi maidan or dressing room ke bich galiyare main dhakka dene kii ghatana kaa video footage maujuud tha
 Gordon said that his lack of evidence led him to rely on his own understanding to arrive at the verdict
 unhone ‘iespien crickinfo’ se kaha, ‘jaise maine saboot dekhe or sambandhit pakshon ke pratinidhiyon ke antim bayaan dekhe, phir maine apni samaj se kaam kiya
 i could not be easily satisfied with any argument of the witness
 ’bharat kaa tark tha ki anderson ne bina uksaae hi jadeja ko dhakka diya
 Jadeja allegedly alleged that Anderson continued to abuse her in the corridor, which also pushed her
 jadeja ne aakraamakata kii baat se inkaar kiya
 According to Anderson, Jadeja was aggressive and came in front of him aggressively without any provocation
 anderson ne kaha ki vah jadeja ke is bartaav se hairaan rah gaye the
 Former Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit, who has held the throne of Delhi for fifteen years, has said that if the BJP has reached the position of forming a government, it should form the government
 unhone yah bhi kaha he ki kisi bhi dal kaa koi vidhayak chunaav nahin chahta he
 The Congress spokesperson was shocked by this statement and the Aam Aadmi Party alleged that BJP and Sheela were merged
 sawaal yah he ki is par hangaamaa kyon? kam se kam congress or aam aadmi party to is bayaan par sawaal na hi uthaae, to behatar he
 After the results came out in December last year, when it was clear that no party would get majority, the BJP decided not to form the government despite emerging as the single largest party
 iske baad aam aadmi party ne congress ke samarthan se sarkaar banaai, yah kehete hue ki dilli kii janata se poochkar hi usne yah faisla kiya he
 This alleged public opinion poll led the Aam Aadmi Party to join hands with the Congress, about which AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal vowed to his children before the election that he would never go with the Congress
 sirf 49 dinon main unhone sarkaar se istipha de diya, kyonki unhen yah galatfahami ho gai thi ki puraa desh dilli kii tarah hi he or dilli kii hi tarah desh kii janata bhi loksabhaa chunaav main unhen haathon-haath le legi
 In the Lok Sabha elections, BJP won all the seven seats of Delhi by a large margin
 agar inhen vidhansabha siton main dekha jaae, to bijepi ne dilli kii 70 main se 60 vidhansabha siton par jeet hasil kii he
 Certainly, this mandate is more authentic than the alleged poll of the Aam Aadmi Party, on the basis of which it joined hands with the Congress to form the government in Delhi
 agar bijepi ise dilli kii janata kii ichha ke rup main pesh kare, to is par aapatti nahin honi chahie
 It is true that BJP may have emerged as the largest party, but it is far from majority
 vidhansabha main vah bahumat tabhi sabit kar paaegi, jab congress yaa aam aadmi party ke kuch vidhayak use samarthan de yaa phir gaiyr-hajir rahakar bijepi ko alpamat kii sarkaar chalaane ke liye mauka de
 There are also allegations of manipulation or horse trading, which cannot be called baseless
 sawaal yah he ki agar dilli main vidhansabha chunaav kara liye jaaen, to kya guarantee he ki kisi ek dal ko bahumat mil hi jayega or jo nattejey disambar main aae, vaise hi dobaaraa nahin aaenge
 Suppose, if a hung assembly is formed again, will there not be a Presidential rule once again
 doosraa paksh vidhayakon kaa he
 Sheila Dixit is right that no MLA from any party wants elections
 aam aadmi party ko bhi apane vidhayakon se eemaandaaree se poochna chahie ki ve kya chaahate hai
 a legislator has no moral basis to go to public and seek votes again, as he has no work to show
 congress main bhi chunaav kii maang vahi log kar rahe hai, jo vidhansabha kaa chunaav haar gaye or jinhen lagata he ki dobaaraa chunaav se shaayad ve vidhansabha main pahunch jaaen
 If the largest party forms the government, it will not be the first time
 1991 main congress ne loksabhaa main sabase badi party ke rup main ubharne ke baad alpamat kii sarkaar chalaai or baad main bahumat kaa jugad kiya
 Being emerging as the largest party, in 1996, Shankar Dayal Sharma gave Atal Bihari Vajpayee the opportunity to form the government
 agar up rajyapal sabase bade dal ke naate bijepi ko sarkaar banane ke liye mauka dena chaahate hai, to isamen kuch bhi asanvaidhanik nahin he
 Sheila Dixit is also saying this
 vahi shila dikshit, jinke bare main kaha jane laga he ki dilli ke log unhen miss karne lage hai

 The trailer of Salman Khan's film Bharat has been released
 res 3 ko critics se behad kharaab retings mili or box offis par bhi film ne ausat safalataa hi hasil kii
 Last year it was such that all three superstars Khan could not show their fire at the box office
 haalanki, res 3 ke jatke ke baad salmaan ek baar phir blockbster film kii talash main hai or 'bharat' salmaan kii wo film sabit ho sakati he jo unhen ek baar phir bollywood ke sabase bade star kaa tamgaa dilaa sakati he
 In addition to Salman in this multistarrer film, there are stars like Disha Patni, Jackie Shroff, Katrina Kaif and Sunil Grover who have a tremendous fan base of their own
 diarector ali abbaas jafar he, jinke saath salmaan 'sultan' or 'tiger jinda he' jaisi superhit film de chuke hai lekin iske baavjood ek factor aisa he, jiske chalate bharat kii kamai par fark pad saktaa he
 The 3 minute 11 second India trailer was released recently and as is often the case, this trailer of Salman's film started trending at number one as soon as it was released
 salmaan kii filmon kii khaas baat ye he ki unki filmon ke trailor ko aksar phens se jabardast pyaar miltaa he or kai baar to trailor dekhakar andaaza laga liya jaataa he ki unki film kitna bijness karne ja rahi he
 However, this time there is a section of Salman fans who have not liked this trailer
 in phens kii shikaayat he ki trailor dekhne ke baad film kii kahani kaa pataa nahin chal paa rahaa he or unki pichhali filmon ke mukaable bharat kaa trailor kam manoranjak he
 There was a time when Salman Khan used to appear on screen and there was a wave of happiness in the audience
 ready, bodyguard, kik, dabang jaisi kai filmein hai jisamen salmaan ne keval apni screen pregence se hi kamjor se kamjor film ko ubaara
 However, in the last few years, due to social media such as powerful media, people have been wary of the test of masala films and the days of movies are being played only by the star factor
 bharat main ek bada varg ab sirf achche content kii parvaah karata he jiske chalate kai sitaron ko bhi apane confort jone se baahar nikal kar acchhee storiline par focus karnaa pad rahaa he
 Salman's Bharat can also be called a similar film
 ye film korean film od tu maai fadar kaa rimek he
 The film depicts the journey of a man whose backdrop is also divided by indo-pak
 od tu maai fadar ko south korea kii behtareen film main shumaar kiya jaataa he or mana ja rahaa he ki salmaan kii is film main bhi plot unki pichhali filmon kii tulana main jatil ho saktaa he
 In such a situation, the audience of Salman who only comes to see them on screen and who do not have much meaning from the script, some such fans can be a bit spoiled by this film which will be nothing short of an irony for Salman
 lekin agar bharat apane screenple or apni script ke chalate behtareen pradarshan karti he to aise main ye bollywood ke liye ek sunaharaa samay sabit ho saktaa he kyonki agar ek star agar apni star power se itar film kii script par mehnat karnaa zyada jaruri samajhataa he to desh ke cinemapremiyon ke liye ye kisi saugat se kam nahin hoga
 The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has introduced the new Grade a + category, which accommodates 5 players including captain Virat Kohli
 grad e+ main shaamil cricketron ko board salanaa 7 karod rupee kaa bhugtan karegaa
 Former captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni and current captain Virat Kohli had themselves suggested to reward players who have consistently performed well in grade a + category
 2017 main 33 match, 1637 ran or 1300% bad gai shikhar dhawan kii sailareedrasal, team india ke pichley mukhya coach anil kumble ne pe strecchar (bhugtan sanrachana) par pahal kii thi
 He first spoke to senior players and then placed it before the Cricket Administrative Committee (COA) set up by the Supreme Court
 kumble ne pichley saal may main coach pad chhodane se ek maheenaa pehle sioe or bisisiai ke sheersh padaadhikariyon ke saamne nae selary strecchar par pregentation bhi di thi
 In that Kumble model, the top contract of 5 crores was kept
 iske baad sieo kaa khilaadiyon ke vetan vruddhi masale par kohli, dhoni, rohit sharma or team india ke mukhya coach ravi shastri ke saath baithkon kaa daur chalaa
 Eventually in December the players recommended an a + category contract
 dhoni se zyada hui rohit-kohli kii selary, shami BCCI ke central contract se bahrasioe adhyaksh vinod raay ek intervyuu main kah chuke hai ki yah suzav dhoni or viraat kii taraf se aayaa tha
 Both of them wanted to keep the a + category for the best performers
 unka tark tha ki is shrenee main keval unhi khilaadiyon ko rakhaa jaae, jo teenon formet main khel rahe hon or top-10 ranking main hon
 That is, the 5 who are in the top category are currently playing in all three formats
 ve zyada vetan paane ke hakdaar hai
 And Dhoni dropped out of the a + category on this basis
 unhen duusari duusari shrenee- grad e mili
 This category includes players who are scheduled to play in one format
 dhoni test se sanyas le chuke hai
 Ashwin and Jadeja are no longer in the limited-overs selection contenders
 saaha or pujaara keval test match main khel rahe hai
 So all these are placed in the second category
 jaahir he 'adhik match khelo or adhik vetan paao' kii tarj par grad kaa nirdhaaran kiya gaya he

 One week to complete the historic victory in Uttar Pradesh elections, but the Bharatiya Janata Party is yet to declare its CM
 party ke pradeshdhyaksh keshav prasad maury daawa kar rahe hai ki shanivaar yani 18 march kii shaam tak siem kaa naam final kar liya jayega lekin maury ke bayaan se ye bhi sanket mili hai ki khud unki daavedaari is pad par kamjor pad gai he
 Maurya said that in the case of the new CM of UP, the party high command had sought a report from him and he has submitted this report
 buudhvaar ko bhi maury ne bayaan diya tha ki unase siem pad par unki pasand poochi gai he or ve apni ore se naam partydhyaksh amit shaahako denge
 This statement by Maurya indicates that he has been left out of the list of possible chief ministers of UP
 kyonki maury se unke pasandida naam maangane kaa matlab hi ek tarah se khud unki daavedaari khatm kar dena hota he
 Significantly, after the results of the UP elections are declared, Maurya is said to be a big contender for the post of CM
 unke netritv main party ko upi main aitihaasik jeet mili
 He is a prominent leader of Amit Shah and Narendra Modi and his non-yadav OBC sections are considered to be instrumental in diverting the votes to BJP
 haalanki ve pehali baar saansad bane hai or prashasnic anubhav kii unamem kami he
 Apart from this, his image is also not that of a leader with mass support
