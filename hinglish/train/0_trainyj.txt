 Settling for citizens of another country in Britain will no longer be easy
 britain kii sarkaar pravaasiyon ko die gaye 'rhite tu settle' ke adhikaar par bandishen lagane ja rahi hai
 If this happens, then it will also affect thousands of Indians who are looking to settle in Britain

 The Sunday Times quoted sources as saying that Home Minister and Immigration Minister Damian Green's team is considering ways to end the 'right to Settle', but big industrialists and investors may be kept out of the purview

 kendriya mantri general wike singh ne rajyasabha main unke bayaan par shor machaane waalon ke liye apane fasebuk pej par lanbaa jawaab diya he
 He has said that even his younger children would have easily understood what he said about the tragic murder of Dalit children, but his statement suddenly awakened "worshipers of divisive politics and betel journalists"
 general singh ne likhaa ki meraa hameshaa se vishwaas tha ki hamaare desh kii upree pratinidhi sabha main gyaan, anubhav, vivek kaa mahasamagam hota hoga or desh ke pratinidhi bharat ke jatil muddon par tark vitark kar ke samaadhaan dhundhate honge
 i expected the national interest to be paramount in the Rajya Sabha, beyond politics corrupted by inferiority
 parantu meraa yah vishwaas bheeshan rup se tab aahat hua jab maine rajya sabha ke sadasyon ko raajnneeti ke chuuhe billi vaale tuchh khel main lipt paaya jiskaa varnan karnaa bhi mere liye peedaadaayi he
 It was beyond my belief that some members of the Rajya Sabha there seemed to be the same type of elements from which we are taught to be careful from childhood
 tippaniyan i said in a comment a few days ago that law and order is the responsibility of the state government, and by giving a simile, i tried to explain that it is unfair to blame every accident on the central government
 skool jane vaale chote bachche is upama ko sahi samaj jate, parantu jinhone apane jivan kaa uddeshy is sarkaar ko asli muddon se vimukh kar ke kaalpanik muddon se jujhana bana liya he, unke liye yah ek sunaharaa avasar tha
 Worshipers of betel journalism and divisive politics suddenly woke up
 vaise yah bhi prathit ho rahaa tha ki shahzaade vaastaviktaa se cat chuke hai
 The government has done all that is unprecedented in India history in less time than hard work

 !!! General Singh wrote that i always believed that there would be a great gathering of knowledge, experience, wisdom in the upper house of our representatives and the representatives of the country would be looking for solutions by arguing on the complex issues of India
 alpamaanasikta se dooshit raajnneeti se pare, rajya sabha main rashtrahit ke sarvopari hone kii apeksha kii thi maine
 But this belief of mine was horribly hurt when i found the members of the Rajya Sabha indulging in the frivolous game of politics, which is also painful for me to describe
 yah mere vishwaas ke pare tha ki vahaan rajya sabha main kuch sadsy unheen tatwon ke prakaar prathit ho rahe the, jinase hamen bachapan se saavdhaan rahanaa sikhaaya jaataa he
 The comments maine kuch din pehle ek tippanee main kaha tha ki kanoon vyavastha rajya sarkaar kaa jimmaa hoti he, or ek upama de kar yah samajhane kaa prayaas kiya tha ki har durghatana kaa doshaaropan centre sarkaar par karnaa anuchit he
 Young school going children would have understood this simile, but it was a golden opportunity for those who have made the aim of their lives to overcome this government by imaginary issues
 supaari patrakarita or vibhaajak raajnneeti ke upaask yakaayak jaagrit ho uthe
 By the way, it also seemed that the princess was cut off from reality
 sarkaar ne mehnat se kam samay main vah sab sambhav kar dikhaaya jo bharat itihaas main abhootpurv he
 a popular government had become more popular in public with its performance
 agar aise hi chalata rahaa to inkaa nambar nahin aane vaala
 The common man of our country certainly does not make "noise as those goose goats", even if he is tolerant of this drama of yours, but do not forget to consider him a fool
 vah sab jaanata, or sab samajhataa he
 And you target me and say that i am dividing the country in the name of religion and caste? "my principles have been carved out where life is sacrificed for the country
 bhagwaan kaa shukr manaaiye ki bhartiya sena in ghatiya baton main na kabhi padi he, or na kabhi padegi
 “we are just patriots, and want to be just that
 baaki or kuch hamaare jazbe kaa apmaan he
 i am not someone who has inherited a political position, nor someone who has any political ambitions
 main abhi bhi bas ek sainik hum jo desh kii seva main sab kuch arpan karne kaa dam rakhata he
 i just have a hope that my countrymen know me this way, and also your political drama

 Many documents of the office were also seized by the CBI

 - Delhi High Court said that the investigation officer has the right to decide the investigation of the document for investigation, in such a case it is not right to issue an order to interfere in the investigation
 - jaanch ke liye jabt kiye gaye kaagazat or jaanch abhi shuruaati daur main he
 In such a case, the lower court ordered out of its jurisdiction
 - nichali adaalat kii tippanee mukhya maamle par asar daal sakati he lihaaja uski koi jarurat nahin
 - During the initial investigation of Delhi Government, the application to return the documents was neither justified nor desirable
 kyonki isse jaanch prabhavit ho sakati he
 - The rules under which the Delhi government had asked for documents are for furthering the investigation and not for shadowing it

 It is written in Bajwa's letter, 'after visiting his mother in 1861, Dilip Singh came to know about the rich heritage of the Sikh Empire
 apni maa kii maut ke baad unhone bharat aane kii ijaajat maangi
 The British considered their efforts to revive Sikhism a rebellion
 '22 oktober 1983 ko 55 saal kii umr main unka paris main nidhan ho gaya tha
 He was buried in Britain according to Christian customs

 Keep in mind that the Reserve Bank has stopped printing two rupee and five rupee notes
 unki chapai phir shuru hogi yaa nahin, yah kahana mushkil he lekin itnaa tay he ki ek rupye kaa note jald hi prasar main aa jayega
 Actually low-value notes were also discontinued because their printing costs a lot more than the price

 communist party of china (sipisi) ke 35 saal kii umr ke ek adhikari or china ke dakshini shahar nanjing main academik shu chuan sipisi ke un chuninda 2,200 sadasyon main shaamil the jo 18 aktubar kii subah barsaat ke bich beijing ke great haul of pipul main jamaa hue the
 For nearly three-and-a-half hours, Shoe remained seated upright and alert in that cave-like hall and barely clapped any muscle in his body except for loud clapping on all the right occasions
 sipisi ke mahasachiv shi jinping ne paanch saal main ek baar hone vaali party kii ahm rashtriya congress kii shuruyaat kii
 In the marathon speech that lasted three and a half hours, Shu heard his leader "calling for the beginning of a new era"
 china main uske netaaon dwaara ''dor" kii shuruyaat kaa elaan karnaa koi asaamaanya baat nahin he
 The previous four generations of CPC leaders did the same, in line with the communist tradition of recording their figures reflecting the physical progress made in making the move to an ideal state
 lekin party ke is shadjaal ko darkinar bhi kar diya jaae to bhi yah baat to saaf taur par mahasoos kii hi ja sakati thi ki beijing congress main yakeenan china kii raajnneeti main ek bade badlaav ko dekha ja rahaa tha
 The Congress has implemented what was becoming increasingly evident in the last five years of Xi's first term
 china kii sattarudh party ne apane nae karnadhaar ke udai ke liye aadhaar taiyaar kar diya tha or is prakriya main usne samuhik netritv ke us model ko darkinar kar diya jisane china ko pichley do dashak main aarthik tarakkee ke liye vaanchit raajnneetik sthirataa pradaan kar di thi
 Consequently, the Congress, which concluded on October 24, completed half of its expected ten-year term, awarding Xi to a higher position than his two predecessors, Jiang Zhenmin and Hu Jintao
 shi ke ''vichaardhaaratmak yogadan" ko party samvidhan main jagah de di gai jise ''chini vishistataaon ke saath nae daur ke liye samaajwaad ke bare main shi jinping dharnay kii sangya de di gai
 This is actually an extension of Deng Xiaoping's formula of state-controlled capitalism
 maotse tung or deng ke baad shi china ke tisare netaa hai jinka naam samvidhan main shaamil kiya gaya he
 Some people may find this thing minor but it has special importance in Chinese politics
 maao va deng ke maamle main iskaa taatpary yah tha ki ve prabhavi rup se jeevanaparyant party ke chairman ho gaye the
 In the context of Xi, this means that the question now becomes who is his successor
 euke main skool of oriel and african studies (esoees) ke steve sang kaa kahana he ki ab lagbhag spasht he ki agar koi apratyaashit ghatana nahin hoti he to shi 2022 main agali congress ke baad bhi party par niyantran banaae rakhenge—yaa to party mahasachiv ke rup main yaa phir deng kii hi tarah ''sarvocch netaa" ke rup main jab ve parade ke peeche se apni takat dikhaate rahete the
 Party officials and government media in Beijing are already calling it the beginning of the "third round" for China
 sang kehete hai, ''maao kaa daur janavaadee ganatantr kii shuruyaat karne or china ko ek party-desh ke rup main tabdeel karne ke bare main tha
 Deng's era was about reforms and opening the country to the outside world
 shi kaa daur yani ki nayaa daur vikaas ke chune gaye raste ko lekar party or china ke vishwaas ko saamne rakhane kaa he
 "trey mcarver, a political analyst and co-founder of Beijing's research firm Trivium China, said that Xi in Congress truly signaled the end of Deng's phase and the beginning of Xi's
 ''iskaa matlab yah nahin he ki shi 2022 ke baad bhi aupchaarik rup se bane rahenge par yah jarur he ki agar ve hat jate hai to bhi unka prabhaav bana rahegaa or shaayad nirnayaatmak bhi, thik usee tarah se jaise ki saare aupchaarik padon ko chhod dene ke baad bhi deng kaa prabhaav bana rahaa tha
 "what will the Xi era mean for China and the rest of the world? It is clear that all the power has come down in Xi's hands, but it is not clear how they will use that power
" is sandarbh main javaabon se kahin zyada sawaal saamne khadey hai
 Xi is facing a long list of domestic and foreign fronts by what Chinese Communists address as "major contradictions"
 congress ke dauraan shi ne zyada vishwaas se bhare china ke udai kii saraahna kii or kaha ki ''is daur main china kendriya bhoomika ke najadik pahunchaa he or maanavjaati ke liye zyada ahm yogadan kar rahaa he
 "however, along with this confidence at the global level, there is also a decreasing tolerance for discontent and criticism at the domestic level
 kuch logon kaa kahana he ki yah ashishnutaa paagalpan ke str tak pahunch gai he
 Dozens of workers were forcibly sent out of Beijing before the Congress so that no disruption to the Congress took place
 video strimming yuvaaon main lokapriy he lekin congress ke dauraan isaki hajaaron aplications ne achaanak prasaaran roak diya
 Many popular TV hosts, some of whom sell only cosmetics and handbags, were instructed not to share any opinion
 yah tab he jab khud shi ne sweekaar kiya he ki ''bhautik va saanskrithik jaruratein" bad rahi hai or usee ke saath ''loktantr, kanoon ke shashan, eemaandaaree va nyaay kii maangy bhi china ke logon main bad rahi he
 It is necessary to keep in mind here that "democracy" for Xi and CPC is meant only within the party i
e
 within the strict scope of single party rule
 yahaan tak ki china ke vikaas kaa model bhi visangatiyon bharaa he
 The air of export-based, infrastructure-guided models is slowly coming out
 isse badi pariyojnaon se karj badha or pradooshan kii sthiti bhayaavah hoti ja rahi he
 a bright side in this is the emerging innovative economy, led by private sector companies such as Alibaba and Baidu, which have benefited from the state's withdrawal from certain sectors of the economy
 shi ke netritv vaala desh navonmesh ke liye arabon dollar dene ko to tatpar he lekin vah china kii navonmeshi gaiyr-sarkari arthvyavastha ko khuli chhot dene ko katai raji nahin he
 Insiders in Xi's ideology of Beijing say that Xi is fully aware of these contradictions and has grounded his moves to gain strength quickly
 ab is baat ko aksar kam hi log samaj pate hai ki sipisi main kai logon ne shi ke ubhaar main or parinamswaroop samuhik netritv ko darkinar karne main yogadan diya he to iske peeche kaaran yah he ki ve in samasyaon se paar paane ke liye krantikari najariye kii jarurat ko mahasoos karte hai
 When Xi assumed power in 2012, the biggest challenge before the CPC was that he perceived his own diminishing legalism in the eyes of the Chinese people
 chini madhya varg ke liye mahaj oonchi aarthik vikaas dar hi banaae rakhana paryaapt nahin tha
 Both awareness and discontent were increasing on issues like corruption and pollution
 jawaab main shi ne bhrashtachar ke khilaaf muhim ched di
 Many of his rivals were also dealt with in this, on the other hand, at least at the central level, there was a renewed confidence in the people about leadership
 18 aktubar ko shi ne jo paanch saal kaa blueprint pesh kiya, vah is baat kaa sabase bade sanketak he ki ve in muddon se kaise nibatna chaahate hai
 The party has adopted the "xi Jinping idea" as its latest guiding ideology, a sequel to Deng's reforms and state-directed reforms that accelerated China's development
 shi ne ab ucch ke bajaay tikaoo vikaas par dhyaan kendrit kiya he
 But it is easy to say, difficult to do
 shi ne congress main mana ki ''asantulit or aparyaapt vikaas se paidaa hui gambhir samasyaon ke samaadhaan kii jarurat he" or kaha ki ''vikaas kii gunvattta va prabhaav vah nahin rahe hai jo hone chahie the
 "mcarver makes it clear that," domestically, this means that China's focus is no longer only on economic development
 vah vikaas ke vrihad lakshyon ko hasil karne kii disha main soch rahaa he, jaise ki svachh paryaavaran, majboot saamaajik suraksha network or behatar swasthya suvidhaayen
 "xi has also placed two targets in front of him on the domestic front, indicating that he can continue to lead the party even after 2022
 pehla yah he ki ve 2035 tak ''ek sampann samaaj" khadaa karke china ko ''navonmesh main vaishvik netaa" ke taur par sthapit karnaa chaahate hai
 The second is that by 2050 China will complete its modernization and they will become world leaders in terms of national strength and global influence
 party ke logdusri or sambhavatya zyada badi chunauti us party kii chhavi ko sudhaarna he jo ab bhi yphone haath main liye ghoomane vaali yuva peedi ke saath marxvad-leninavaad kii jubaan main baat karti he
 Shu Chuan, a Suva representative from Nanjing in Congress, expresses this contradiction
 ve nanjing aironautics uniwarsity main padhaate hai jo china ke antariksh kaarykram ke liye kaam karti he lekin vahaan ve marxvaadi adhyayan ke vibhaag kaa netritv karte hai
 Shu uses wechat with great devotion — a social media app that is a mix of Facebook and whatsapp
 yah chini poonjeevaad kaa charam pratik he, jo istemaal karne waalon ko apane daravaaje par mcdonalds se khaadya padaarth mangane or apane shi tsu kutton ke liye dog spa book karne tak kii suvidha detaa he
 On wechat, Shu puts dozens of messages praising the goodness of the party that considers Marx and Mao as God
 sipisi apane makasad ko badhaane or chhavi ko aakarshak banane ke liye shu jaise logon kii taraf dekh rahi he
 He is aware that 8 of the party
 9 karod sabase naveenatam sadsy kisi mishan ke liye party main shaamil nahin hue hai balki isliye hue hai, kyonki unhen pataa he ki party ke network kaa istemaal ve acchhee naukari yaa jald tarakkee hasil karne main kar sakate hai
 Shoe, who has become an online celebrity due to her wechat activism, says, "I try to make the youth feel that their anxieties will be removed
" "shu ke paas roj saikadon sawaal aate hai or ve 48 ghante ke bheetar unamem se harek kaa jawaab dene kii patibaddhta dikhaate hai
 Shu is aware of the current CPC challenges
 ve kehete hai, ''kisi vichaardhaara ko yuva tabhi sweekaar karenge agar uskaa istemaal unki samasyaon ke samaadhaan main kiya jaae
 i try to explain the essence of socialism to students in a more attractive and acceptable way
 " 1989 main thiyenananaman chack par virodh kii ghatana ke baad chini yuva raajnneeti se dur ho gaye hai
 On the contrary, they have jumped into a fierce competition for prosperity in post-reform China
 shu kehete hai ki chaatro se unhen sabase badi chintaa naukariyon ko lekar jhelni padati he, raajnneeti ko lekar nahin
 Shu feels that these people should participate more in politics
 unka sanket is baat ko lekar tha ki 1989 ke baad se party kai myanon main ghumkar usee bindu par pahunch gai he
 Another aspect of Xi's ideology is nationalism
 ve ise party kii vaidhaniktaa ke nae mahatvapurn strot ke rup main dekhte hai
 During his tenure, he has repeatedly emphasized his focus on the "chinese dream" of national revival
 saath hi unhone majboot sena banane or vaishvik str par zyada vishwast china khadaa karne kii himaayat kii he
 Shu says that this message is more appealing to the youth
 ''deshprem peedi ke saath badal jaataa he
 The new generation is in the age of the Internet and is more aware of how difficult it is for a country like China to achieve such achievements and emerge globally
 jitna zyada ve is baat se waakif honge, utana hi prem ve apane desh se karenge
 "global aspirants have understood these sentiments more than their predecessors and therefore put" revival "as the central emotion of their message
 china kaa padosiyon or baaki duniya ke liye iskaa matlab yah ho saktaa he ki unhen ek zyada aatmavishvasi china kaa abhyast ho janaa chahie
 This has been seen in Xi's first term
 khaas taur par unki ahm videsh niti pahal ke rup main
 In the initiative of the ambitious One Belt, One Road (OBOR) scheme, China probably used the terminology of global leadership for the first time
 misacusets institute of technology (emity) main chini raajnneeti or sena ke pramukh visheshgy tailor frevel kaa kahana he ki vaishvik manch par china kii mukhya adaakaari ke bare main ek anuttarit sawaal yah he ki kab china ek netaa kii bhoomika adaa karnaa chahega or mahaj ek aise desh kii nahin, jo sansthaanon ko apane haq main dhaal letaa he
 Only then can he solve global problems or contribute to their solution
 ve kehete hai, ''iskaa matlab hoga vah jokhim uthaanaa jo baaki desh nahin uthaa sakate hai yaa vah keemat adaa karnaa jo baaki desh adaa nahin karte hai
 China still avoids leadership on any front where there is a risk of failure
 "metterwar kaa kahana he ki duniya ko china se itani apeksha to rakhni chahie ki vah ''ab vishwa str par apane visheshadhikaron ko aage badhaane kii disha main zyada mukhar hoga
 "under Xi's leadership, China has established its first foreign military base in Djibouti and has placed greater emphasis on the Chinese Navy to expand its reach into the far-flung seas
" obioar ne bhi china ko apana model aage badhaane ke liye ek saadhan uplabdh kara diya he
 The difference in Xi's rule is that China has gained new confidence in its model, so much so that it has started presenting it as an option to developing countries
 iske liye vah trump va bregsit ke sandarbh main pashchimi loktantron ke saamne pesh aa rahi asthirataaon kii ore bhi ishaara karata he
 (china's official media in its neighborhood continues to highlight India's imperfections to advance its arguments
) As Xi says, China "presents a new option to other developing countries to achieve modernization
" Who want to speed up development while maintaining their independence
 "pramukh chini samrik visheshgy hu sheesheng kehete hai ki china kii videsh niti kaa atimahatvapurn makasad us sthirataa ko sunishvith karnaa hoga jo china ke gharelu uddeshyon kii purti ke liye jaruri he
 Hu says, "as Xi said, China has a thousand reasons to improve relations with America, but there is not a single reason to spoil relations with it
" " yahi baat bharat se rishton par bhi lagu hoti he
 "if the Chinese government wants to make every effort to have a good relationship with America, which is causing the most problems in the world, then it surely wants a good and stable relationship with India which is its huge neighbor and with which domestic development , There are many common grounds in terms of regional integration and global governance
 "saath hi ek hakeekat yah bhi he ki china ne apane padosiyon ke saath vivaadon ko nibatane main kaaphi kam ichhashakti dikhaai he
 Xi has personally shown interest in showing strength in the South China Sea
 unhone china ke ek vivaadaaspad dweep banane ko apane paanch saal ke kaarykaal kii uplabdhiyon main shumaar kiya he, jisase china ko vahaan niyantran majboot karne main madad milti he
 China, with its youngest neighbors Bhutan and India, has also tried to create a structure in an area about which all parties believe that the dispute is yet to be settled
 yah dabangai lagata he ki kaayam rahane vaali he
 Xi Jinping also said in Congress that "no one should understand that China will also digress that harms its interests
" hamaari party, desh, log, senaayen va raashtra apurv tareeke se badal chukaa he
 The Chinese nation stands tall and strong in the east with a new sense
 " yaheen se shi ke yug kii shuruyaat hoti he
 Five people, including three women, committed suicide in the last 24 hours in Lucknow, the capital of Uttar Pradesh

 But it is also necessary to follow the rule of placing idols, the idol of God wrongly planted can also cause trouble in life

 shivaji kii aisi murti yaa tasviir lagaani chahie, jisamen ve khush dikh rahe hon
 Applying images of Virajit or meditation posture on Nandi in the house keeps the atmosphere calm and the sense of concentration increases in children too
 5
 Where the photo of Shiva is located, the place should be very clean
 shivaji ke aasapaas gandagi na rakhen, anyaatha ghar ke dosha bad sakate hai or dhan haani ho sakati he
 6

 Recently her devotees started calling her 'iron Lady'
 khabaron ke anusaar, dilli ke party mukhyalay main unki tasviir ke neeche likhaa he da aayran ladi mayawati
 In fact, a journalist influenced by Margaret Thatcher had given the title of Mayawati's autobiography
 magar aaj uttar pradesh ke bahut saare bacchon ko to mayawati kaa puraa naam bhi likhnaa nahin aata
 This not only highlights the successes of his government but also brings out the real face of the state's primary education system

 bachche bhi unka naam sunate, jaanate or chehre ko pahachaanate hai
 But no one should teach reading and writing in school

 According to ASER, the situation is pathetic

 In Bihar and Rajasthan this figure is 43 respectively

 Was 4 percent
 surveykshan ke anusaar, uttar pradesh main kaksha 5 ke keval 14 pratishat chaatr angreji main puraa vaakya pard sakate the (iske mukaable bihar main yah pratishat 31

 isliye mukhyamantri ko aayran ladi banaakar unki kamyaabi kii charchaa karne se pehle bacchon ko unka sahi or puraa naam likhnaa hi sikhaa den taaki ve aayran ladi kah saken, samaj saken or likh bhi saken

 party ko ekajute karne ke liye rajnath-modi dinar kootneeti apane makasad main naakaam rahi
 On Thursday, when voting was going on on the land acquisition bill in the presence of BJP President Rajnath Singh and Leader of Opposition in the House Sushma Swaraj, Narendra Modi was waiting for them at a dinner party held at the party president's house
 yah modi ke chunaav prachaar samiti ke adhyaksh banane ke baad pehali baar party ke saansadon se mulaakaat kaa kaarykram tha
 The party was to be held at Rajnath Singh's house at 7:30
 gujarat ke mukhyamantri or arun jetali va ravishankar prasad samet rajyasabha ke tamaam bijepi saansad kareeb saadhe 9 baje tak party sthal par pahunch gaye
 But many senior leaders of the party, including Rajnath Singh, Advani and Sushma, remained stuck in voting on the land acquisition bill in the Lok Sabha
 party main mishan 272 plus par pregentation hona tha
 Although the BJP president also requested for the voting to be held on Friday in the Lok Sabha, the government refused
 voting raat kareeb 10:20 tak chali
 On the other hand, Modi was looking forward and Sushma was here to praise Jairam Ramesh for the bill
 rajnath, adwani or sushamaa kareeb saadhe 10 baje party main pahunch paae
 By then most of the mps including Arun Jaitley and Navjot Singh Sidhu had left
 ab sawaal yah he ki kya is sambandh main sushamaa, adwani or rajnath main baat ho chuki thi? In Uttar Pradesh, complaints of primary teachers not going to school have increased so much that now a "selfie attendance" has been made necessary for them
 yani har subah teacher skool pahunchakar skool ke becoground main selfi lekar afasar ko post karnaa hoti he
 If you do not get selfie till 8 am, then his salary will be deducted
 sirf barabanki zile main ab tak 700 shikshakon kii tankhwaah cat chuki he
 All teachers are accused of not going to school or sending someone else to teach in their place
 subah-subah upi ke tamaam primary skulon main ab ek nayaa najaara dekhne ko miltaa he
 Taking a selfie stick in his hands, the teacher takes a selfie by making a 'teacher' serious pose
 kai baar ve akele-akele selfi lete hai, to kabhi apane saathi teacheron ke saath
 Then post it on the BSA web page
 jinaki nazar har selfi par hoti he
 Barabanki's CDO says that at first only half the teachers used to come to school
 barabanki kii sidio medha rupam kahati hai ki kaafii shikaayatein aa rahi thim ki teacher lakhanu main rahete hai or barabanki padhaane ke liye nahin aate
 When i got posted here, i also did some inspections
 maine jab bhi inspection kiye 50 pratishat teacher nahin aa rahe the
 Teacher says that selfie also has some principles
 muskuraate hue selfi nahin lee jaati
 The photo should have a serious face like a teacher
 lekin rose skool aane vaale teacher khush hai
 They say that those who do not come get the same salary as those who come
 ab yah bhedbhaav band hoga
 Assistant Teacher Deepika Singh said that teachers do not come anywhere, and those who come have to bear the brunt of it
 to mere khyaal se yah bahut acha he
 'take special importance of time in life 


 Wake from time 


 Study from time 


 Come to school from time 


 One day passed, then one day of life fell short
 ' barabanki ke badel primary skool ke headmaster ab bacchon ko bhi vakt se aane kaa paath padhaa rahe hai
 They are happy that this has made the job of Headmaster easy
 badel ke praathmik vidhyalay ke headmaster veda prakaash shrivastav ne kaha ki kuch aise praadhyaapak hai jo kehete hai ki hamaara staff samay se nahin aata he to unke liye to bahut badi raahat kii chiz he ki samay se unke shikshak aate hai
 If they do not come, then those teachers themselves are responsible
 doordaraj ke ilaakon main rahane kii suvidhaayen na hone kii vajah se tamaam teacher shaharon main rahete hai
 Schools are late from there
 kai teacher skool nahin jate or apni jagah kam paise main gaanv ke kisi ladke ko padhaane kaa kaam de dete hai
 Many female teachers do not arrive on time
 shikshak subhash chandra shrivastav ne bataaya ki janapad barabanki main banki, dev, neembura ye aise block hai jahaan 80 se 85 fisadi mahilaayein karyrat hai
 So they have the same problem that they also have to discharge the responsibilities of the household

 karnataka main ek teesraa kone bhi he or wo he jedies, yani devgauda kii party yah party dikhaanaa to yah chaahati he ki wo bijepi ke khilaaf he magar bijepi ke liye daravaaje khule bhi rakhana chaahati he
 While Dev Gowda shows that he is against the BJP, Kumaraswamy has no faith
 wo pehle bhi bijepi ke saath ja chuke hai
 If there was a hung assembly, the JDS would play the role of King Maker
 karnataka ke liye bijepi ne sam, daam, dand, bhed kii ranneeti apana rakhi he or koi bhi kasar nahin chod rakhi he
 Especially considering the importance of Lingayat votes, Yeddyurappa is trying to become the chief minister
 karnataka main lingayat kii aabaadi 17 fisadi he, jo kaaphi mahatvapurn he kisi bhi party ke liye
 The comments yahi vajah he ki amit shah or rahul gandhi donon lingayat mathon kaa chakkar laga chuke hai or to or siddharmaiya to ek kadam jate hue lingayat ko ek alag dharm or alpsankhyak kaa darja de daalaa
 The BJP has laid another siege in view of this, so the Reddy brothers have sat on the bjp's lap with immense wealth
 sudhakar reddy ko to tikat nahin diya gaya magar unke bhai karunakar reddy or shomshekhar reddy sahit parivaar ke 6 sadasyon ko tikat die gaye hai
 That is, the BJP wants Karnataka in every hurry, but the biggest question is, but why? The reason is to set foot in the south as well as this small state of Kerala where till now has been ruled by the Left or the Congress
 haal ke dinon main bijepi or vam dalon ke kaaryaktaaon ke khooni sanrghash se kerala kii dharti lahuluhaan hi hui he
 
 ek anumaan ke anusaar kerala main bijepi ke 44 or vamadalon ke 45 or congress ke 17 kaaryakattaaon ne apni jaan gavai he
 This is the reason that after winning Karnataka, it is necessary for Mission Kerala to win Karnataka
 bijepi ko vamadalon ke haath se kerala jeetne kii khushi tripura jeetne se zyada aatm santosh degi or ek baar karnataka or kerala amit shah or pradhanmantri kii jholii main aa jaataa he to donon kah sakate hai ki bharat ko congress mukt karne kaa unka sapana lagbhag puraa ho gaya he

 This is the reason why both Amit Shah and Rahul Gandhi have visited the Lingayat monasteries, and Siddaramaiah went one step and gave Lingayat a separate religion and minority status
 bijepi ne isko dekhte hue ek or gheraabandi kar rakhi he to apaar dhan bal ke saath reddy bandhu bijepi kii god main baithe chuke hai
 Sudhakar Reddy was not given a ticket, but his family members, including his brother Karunakara Reddy and Shomshekhar Reddy, have been given tickets
 yani karnataka to harhaal main bijepi ko chahie magar sabase bada sawaal he magar aakhir kyon? vajah dakshin main pair jamaana to he hi saath main yah chota sa rajya kerala jahaan abhi tak vampanth yaa congress kaa hi shashan rahaa he
 In recent times, the land of Kerala has been bled by the bloody struggle of the workers of BJP and Left parties
 
 According to one estimate, 44 BJP and 45 Left party and 17 Congress workers have lost their lives in Kerala
 yahi vajah he ki karnataka jeetne ke baad mishan kerala ke liye karnataka ko jeetna jaruri he
 The BJP will be happy to win Kerala from the hands of the Left and will give more self-satisfaction than winning Tripura and once Karnataka and Kerala fall in the hands of Amit Shah and the Prime Minister, both can say that their dream of making India Congress-free is almost fulfilled
 has gone

 Indian officials told the Press Trust here that the common feeling in both the countries is that any country has suffered due to tensions arising out of unfavorable reports in the media of both countries regarding the visit of Arunachal Pradesh and the Dalai Lama
 The benefits have not been received

 The President was overwhelmed by the reception made by the students at the University
 swaagat main badi taadaad main chatraayen bhi shaamil thim, jinhone apane buddhible se aadhe se zyada tamge apni jholii main daale the
 The President recalled the names of several distinguished alumni of the university, embodying the role of AMU
 unhen puraa yakeen tha ki yahaan padhai kar rahe chaatr 'bharat bhagya vidhaataa' hai jo bhavishya main hindustan kii seva karenge
 Former President Pranab Mukherjee praised AMU as the chief guest on the 200th anniversary of Sir Syed Ahmed Khan and described it as a perfect example of Indian nationalism, where students from different religious, ethnic, regional and linguistic backgrounds live the concept of nationalism
 
 is baar bhi yah eemyu or rashtrawaad hi he, par swar or mudraaen alahada hai
 More than a week later, AMU has been facing media trials everywhere, with BJP spokespersons, right-wing debaters and some over-enthusiastic anchors using rhetorically traitorous and traitorous legends for every person standing in favor of the university
 Huh
 media main karnabhedi awaajen or zyada tikhi ho gai hai
 Some headlines on prime time television were screaming - 'jinnah ka jinn', 'AMU will be free from jinnah', 'AMU will celebrate the founders or jinnah'
 uniwarsity ke students union haul main mohammad ali jinna kii tasviir ke mudde ne desh kii duusari buree yaa acchhee khabaron ko apni chaaya se dhak liya he
 It all started with a letter dated April 30, written by Aligarh MP Satish Gautam to AMU Vice Chancellor (VC) Professor Tariq Mansoor
 isamen unhone visi se uniwarsity ke students union haul kii diwaar par tangi mohammad ali jinna kii tasviir ko hataane ke liye kaha tha
 Before this letter was received by the VC office, it was discussed in the media
 chitthee ke jawaab kaa intjaar kiye bagaiyr or uniwarsity ko faisla lene kaa jaraa bhi vakt die bagaiyr hindu jaagran manch, hindu yuva vahini or abivipi ke sahyogi sanghathanon ke log 2 may ko campus main dhaddhadaate hue ghus aae
 He threatened and shouted offensive slogans along with the security staff of the university
 chitthee likhane kaa yah vakt, hinsa or electronic media main is par yojanabaddh bahason ne ek aisa mudda khadaa kar diya jisamen voton kaa dhruvikaran karne kii takat or sambhaavna he, khaskar tab jab karnataka ke chunaav itane najadik the or 2019 kaa mishan bhi saamne dikhaai de rahaa tha
 Muslims, AMU, Jinnah and the so-called 'army of traitors' were the heads of cocktail-speaking cocktails
 gautam ne eemyu ke nirnay lene vaale sabase oonche nikaay aligarh muslim uniwarsity court ke sadsy ke taur par apane kaarykaal ke dauraan yah mudda kabhi nahin uthaaya
 Being a lawmaker, he could have raised this issue in Parliament as well and insisted on all the photographs of Jinnah in the country to enact a ban
 tasviir lagane ko lekar chal rahi bahes main eemyu ke chaatro ke khilaaf barbar police karrwai ke mudde ko bhi mila diya gaya
 This action was taken against him when he went to register an FIR against the forcible entry of right-wing pranks on campus
 eemyu ke chaatro par is police karrwai se takreeban puraa campus uniwarsity kii sadak par aa gaya or doshiyon kii giraftaar ke saath ghatana kii nyaayik jaanch kii maang karne laga
 The AMU Teachers Association also wholeheartedly supported the students at its General Assembly meeting held on 3 May
 police karrwai ke khilaaf pradarshan karte eemyu chaatro kii tasviren chaitarafa failaai gai hai
 However, these are the same pictures of AMU students protesting, which have been used by electronic media and social networking sites to portray him as a supporter and sympathizer of Jinnah
 chaatro kii vishaal bheed ko dikhaati in tasveeron ke saath gumraah karne vaale capshan lagaakar unhen bahut shararti dhang se jinna ke prati unke samarthan ke saboot ke taur par pesh kiya gaya
 The fact is that no student or teacher of AMU is neither a supporter nor sympathizer of Jinnah
 jinna eemyu ke har shaks ke liye itihaas hai—ek takalifdeh itihaas
 a slogan of the AMU students describes their stand, "jinnah is history, not faith
" ''union haul main jinna kii tasviir 1938 se hi lagi he, jab unhen eemyu student union kii aaajeevan sadsyta se nawaja gaya tha
 It is studded with photographs of many others there, including Gandhiji, Jawaharlal Nehru, b
 aar
 Ambedkar and Jinnah's staunch critic Abul Kalam Azad are also included
 yah tasviir vahaan aitihaasik abhilekh ke taur par he
 It has archaeological significance
 yah avibhajit hindustan ke itihaas kaa abhilekh he
 There is an opinion in the university that things are possible on Jinnah's picture not to stop
 agar jinna kii tasviir hataa bhi lee jaati he, to is baat kii koi guarantee nahin he ki duusari aitihaasik shakhsiyaton kii tasviren hataane or unke naam par kaayam kuch imaaraton ke naam badalane kii maangen nahin uthengi
 There may also be a demand that photographs of Muhammad Iqbal be removed and removed from the course altogether

 Advertising spending in digital media has increased rapidly in the last few years and this trend can only continue as the number of people using the internet is growing rapidly

 This softness is more in the case of English magazine magazines than in Indian languages

 After the general election, the government's expenditure on advertising will gradually decrease, in such a way that if the economic growth does not accelerate, then the expenditure on pintra media in 2014-15 can be mild

 Australian fast bowler Glenn mcgrath believes that fast bowlers around the world are at a disadvantage due to getting more money in less time than the popular T20 league, as they are not working hard after their initial success
 mcgra ne pisie stadium main under-23 koching clinics ke baad kaha, 'mujhe bharat hi nahin, balki puri duniya main jo sabase bada masalaa lagata he, vah yah he ki ve kitni kadi mehnat karte hai
 If they achieve some success by playing Big Bash in IPL or Australia, they feel that they have achieved a high level and they stop working hard and do not practice too much
 ' The former Australian bowler said, 'young bowlers have to be ready to work hard and then they will have to work harder to retain their place
 iske liye koi aasaan vikalp yaa short cat nahin he
 Many times i see that young cricketers reach a certain level, then suddenly they get good money and they stop working
 ' tippaniyan mcgraw said, 'I believe that money should not always be a top priority
 yah acha he ki cricketer acchhee kamai kar rahe he, lekin agar aapane paise ko duusari shrenee main rakhaa or hameshaa acha pradarshan karne, uske liye ji-tod mehnat karne or khud ko sarvshereshth paristhiti main rakhane par dhyaan diya to paisa hameshaa aata rahegaa
 i believe that a cricketer should have such an attitude

 a post shared by Bollywood songs (@bollywood_tellywoodfanatic) on Dec 8, 2018 at 9:29am PST Ever since the banning of cow slaughter in Maharashtra has come into force, there has been an uproar on social media
 kuch bhayaavah taur par ise apni azaadi se jod rahe hai to kuch ise apni bhaawanaaon se tol rahe hai
 But the reality remains somewhere between these two
 pehali galatfahami to maharashtra sarkaar ke kanoon ke naam ko lekar hi hui he
 It has been named the banning cow-dynasty killing law, which makes it feel that the government has brought restrictions on cow slaughter
 sachai kuch or he
 Cow meat has not been sold in Maharashtra since 1976
 yahaan pehle se hi aisa kanoon he jiske mutabik aisa karnaa aparaadh he
 Cow meat in Mumbai, Maharashtra was closed since 1956
 tab acharya vinoba bhaave kii guzarish par shahar ke kuraishi or hindu samaaj ne gau maance ko lekar pabandi shuru kar di thi
 This was also the period when riots often took place over cows
 tab donon dharmon ke maansaahaar seven karne waalon ne bhaawanaaon ko samajhane kii koshish kii thi
 So what does the government want to do now? Why was the cow-dynasty added to this name? The government argues that its objective is now to bring a ban on the meat of bulls and calves, so that there will be plenty of bulls in the agricultural villages
 ye donon maansaahaar 'bif' kii shrenee main aate hai
 Meat of buffalo is also considered under Beef
 lekin aankade bataate hai ki rajya main khapat hone vaale bif main 80 fisadi bail or bachade kaa maance he
 Only 20 percent are other products
 bada sawaal he ki kya ye bif kii khapat sirf ek samudaay karata he? is pabandi ke paksh main jo log khadey hai unki daleelon ko sunenge to shaayad aapako yahi ahsaas hoga
 But the reality is that everyone is the one who consumes it, religion does not come in anywhere
 hindu-muslmaan garib ke bhojan kaa hissaa ye maance pehle se rahaa he
 Evidence of this remains in abundance
 kai baar to samaaj main chuaachhut bhi is baat par nirbhar hui he ki aap kis kism kaa maance khate hai
 But the big question is whether the poor people of the state have options for cheap meat
 zaraa aap maance kii keemton ke fark ko dekhie
 The price of mutton is 450 rupees kg while the beef is running about 150 rupees kg
 sasta protein garib ke liye jaruri he lekin tark dene vaale kah rahe hai ki garib-amir doosraa maance kyon nahin kha sakate? doosraa paksh kah rahaa he ki ham kya khaaenge ye koun tay karegaa? kyon bhojan paramparaon kaa dhyaan nahin rakhaa jayega? Beyond all these arguments, there are people who are saying why should any kind of meat be eaten? When i have them, i have everything

 Most of us will be the ones who spend most of their time wearing jeans
 genes kii lokapriyata kaa andaja aap is baat se bhi laga sakate hai ki aaj ke samay main ye har kisi kii aalmaari kaa hissaa ban chuki he
 It is very comfortable to wear
 ek baat or zyaadaatar log genes isliye bhi kharidte hai kyonki genes bahut jaldi gandi nahin hoti he or ise kai baar bina dhule bhi pahana ja saktaa he
 But there is a need to pay attention while washing the jeans because almost all jeans are made of cotton
 aise main sawaal ye uthta he ki genes dhoen to dhoen kaise?aaie ham aapako wo tareeke bataate hai jisase aapakigines kaa rang jaldi feekaa nahin padegaa or wo lambey samay takapaka saath nibhaayegi:washing mashin main dhone ke daurangar aapgines ko washing mashin main dho rahe hanto aapaki mashin jental mod par honi chahie
 This does not fade the color of your jeans
 disergent ke chayan main bhi barte saavdhaneeditorgent se genes kaise dhoen? hameshaa hi mild disergent kaa istemaal karnaa chahie
 Avoid using bleach or detergents that contain a large amount of castic soda
 thanda panikya genes dhote vakt aapako hameshaa ye dar bana rahata he ki kahin aapaki genes rang na chhod de? genes ko hameshaa thande pani se dhonaa chahie yaa phir gunagune pani se
 Jeans should never be washed with hot water
 garm pani kii vajah se genes rang chhod sakati he, khaastaur par gadhe rang kii genes
 There is also the risk of shrinking the jeans after washing with hot water
 genes ko hameshaa ulta karke dhoengenes dhote vakt is baat kaa vishesh khyaal rakhana chahie ki dhone se pehle hi aap use palat len
 The upper part comes in and the inside is up
 isse genes ke damege hone kaa khatra kam ho jaataa he
 The instruction written on jeans is clearly written on the jeans, how to wash it and how to keep it
 amuman log in instrection ko padhakar bhi najar andaaj kar dete hai
 Try to follow all these instructions
 genes ko baaki kapadon se alag dhonagines ko baaki kapadon se alag dhonaa chahie
 It should not happen that the cloth with which you are washing the jeans leaves a color
 varanaa aapaki genes kharaab ho sakati he
 It is best to wash jeans by hand
 iske saath hi genes ko bahut adhik nahin dhonaa chahie varanaa iskaa rang bahut jaldi feekaa pad jayega

 In such a situation, i have to find other things that look like the same

 "another artistic challenge was to create something that could take you back in time
