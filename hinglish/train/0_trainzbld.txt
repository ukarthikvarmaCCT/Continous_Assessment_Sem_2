 It is feared that assembly elections will be held in West Bengal at the time of the T20 World Cup in 2016 and in view of this, the Bengal Cricket Association (CAB) is willing to urge the Election Commission through the West Bengal government that its The event should be designed keeping in mind the final match to be held at the Eden Gardens
 bisisiine jo kaarykram jari kiya he, uske anusaar eden gardens 11 march se teen april ke bich hone vaale world tii20 ke finalmaichaki mejabani karegaa
 Trinamool Congress MP Sultan Ahmed, however, expressed apprehension at the 84th AGM of the CAB that assembly elections may take place during this period
 mohammaden sporting ke adhyaksh ne cab adhyaksh jagmohan daalamia se aagrah kiya ki mukhyamantri mamata banerjee ke jariye yah masalaa chunaav ayog ke samaksh rakhana chahie

 unhone kaha, ‘us dauraan chunaav hone hai
 It is the job of the cab to look into it
 hamaare paas board main kuch anbhavi log he or mujhe puraa vishwaas he ki sab kuch aasaani se sulajhaa liya jayega
 The state assembly elections are generally held in five stages

 ye 23 may kii us pikchar kaa trailor he, jisamen narendra modi phir se bhartiya raajnneeti ke superhiro banane ja rahe hai
 According to exit poll of Aaj Tak- Axis My India, this time Narendra Modi's wave is not a tsunami
 iske saamne naa koi gathbandhan tikega or naa vipaksh kaa koi ganit
 It seems that for the second time in a row, Narendra Modi is going to completely destroy the opposition
 agar ye anumaan 23 may ko nateezon main badal jaataa he to desh kii siyasat main kai ahm badlaav sambhav hai
 
 
 
 or majboot hogi piem modi kii chhaviis chunaav main jis tarah se vipaksh ne ekajute hokar narendra modi ko takkar dene main jor lagaaya tha
 It seemed to him that this time the BJP might stay away from the majority figure, but exit poll estimates are proving that anything is possible if it is Modi
 anumaan agar sahi sabit hote hai to aane vaale paanch saalon main piem modi kii chhavi or majboot ho jaaegi
 Like demonetisation, GST, Modi can take even bigger decisions in the coming five years
 modi sarkaar part-2 main amit shah kaa badhegaa kachnumaanon se saaf he ki desh main modi tsunami he
 The superhero of this tsunami is PM Narendra Modi and the hero is BJP President Amit Shah
 apane booth management ko lekar hameshaa charchaa main rahane vaale amit shah par madhyapradesh, rajasthan or chhattisgarh kii haar par jo sawaal uth rahe the, vah khamosh ho jaaenge or ek baar phir unke chanakya niti kii har jagah tarif hogi
 In the coming five years, Amit Shah's stature may be much bigger in Modi Sarkar Part-2
 adhar main vipaksh ke gathbandhanon kaa bhavishyahaalanki, agsit pole ke baad bhale hi vipaksh 23 may tak intazaar karne ko kah rahaa he or apni ummiden 23 may ke din par lagaae he, lekin ek trend to agsit pols se dikh hi gaya he ki narendra modi ke naam ko takkar dene vaala is vakt bhartiya raajnneeti main koi nahin he
 In a state like UP where Mayawati and Akhilesh had given a big challenge, Narendra Modi is seen to be badly demolishing this electoral duo
 anumaanon se saaf he ki vipaksh ke liye modi tsunami ek chintaa kii baat ban gai he
 It is also a matter of concern for alliances that were built to stop Modi's victory chariot
 inkaa bhavishya khatre main he
 The questions will again arise on Rahul in the Congress, the Congress may be most uneasy with the expectations
 congress ne yah chunaav kaaphi aakraamak tareeke se ladaa tha
 Priyanka Gandhi, along with Rahul Gandhi, surrounded the Modi government everywhere after taking an official entry into politics, but exit poll estimates suggest that the brother-sister duo could not succeed in stopping Modi's victory chariot
 2014 kii tarah 2019 main congress kaa pradarshan ausat rahane kii ummid he
 In such a situation there can be a great upheaval within the Congress
 rahul gandhi kii netritv kshamta par sawaal uth sakate hai
 The threat to the government of Bengal, Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh, if proven to be true, may ring another big danger for the Congress
 modi tsunami ke baad bijepi kaa puraa focus pashchim bengal, karnataka or madhyapradesh kii rajya sarkaron ke khilaaf oparation lotus chalaane par ho saktaa he
 In Bengal, PM Modi has said that he has 40 TMC mlas in contact
 jabaki karnataka main bijepi do baar oparation lotus chalaa chuki he
 Now, by running Operation Lotus for the third time, the BJP can try to coup there
 iske alaava madhyapradesh kii kamalnath sarkaar par bhi khatre ke badal mandara sakate hai
 BJP can also try to form government there
 aane vaale chunaavon main milegaa phaaydaegsit pole ke anumaan yahi he ki narendra modi naa sirf 2014 vaale apane garh bachaae hai, balki dusron ke garh main jaakar chunavi strike kar di he
 Now bjp's preparation will be for the upcoming assembly elections
 centre kii satta main prachand bahumat ke saath dobaaraa aane ke baad bijepi ke hausale buland honge or puure damakham ke saath vah in vidhansabha chunaavon main apana puraa jor lagaaegi
 Assembly elections may be held this year only in big states like Delhi, Haryana, Jammu and Kashmir, Maharashtra, Jharkhand
 in rajyon main bijepi ko modi tsunami kaa phayda milegaa
 According to the exit poll, the NDA may get 339 to 365, UPA 77 to 108 and other parties 69 to 95 seats
 agar 23 may ko kamobesh yahi aankade rahete hai to phir ye 1971 ke baad pehali baar aisa hoga ki koi netaa lagaataar duusari baar purna bahumat ke saath sarkaar main aayega
 This charisma was done by Indira Gandhi in 1971 and now Narendra Modi is going to do such a charisma, because the inference is that Modi is a tsunami in the whole country

 Let us know that HS Phoolka became the Leader of Opposition in Punjab in March 2017, but shortly after he resigned from the post of Leader of Opposition saying that he wants to focus on the 1984 case
 saal 2015 main guru granth sahib se hui brudabi ke maamle main punjab sarkaar ke deele ravaiyye ke virodh main unhone vidhayaki se bhi istipha de diya tha
 Phoolka was not seen in Aam Aadmi Party meetings for a long time
 phulka ne saarvajanik taur par kaha tha ki agar aam aadmi party kaa congress se gathbandhan hua to main istipha de duungaa
 However, now the Aam Aadmi Party is not going to have an alliance with the Congress

 In September, former Prime Minister Dr
 Manmohan Singh targeted the Modi government over the economy
 unhone kaha tha ki arthvyavastha kharaab se behad kharaab hoti ja rahi he or khatarnaak baat ye he ki sarkaar ko is baat kaa ehsaas nahin he
 We are in an economic downturn
 vikaas dar ghatakar 5 fisadi rah gai he
 Why the Nobel winner did not like Government policies Abhijit Banerjee, an Indian American citizen of India, has been awarded the 2019 Nobel Prize for Economics
 aword jeetne ke baad unhone kaha tha ki bharat kii arthvyavastha kii sthiti danvadol he
 The current data does not give any assurance that the health of the economy will improve soon
 haalanki ab bharat sarkaar ko bhi lagane laga he ki sachmuch arthvyavastha kii haalat kharaab he
 Finance Minister's husband had also commented on the government, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman's husband and former Andhra Pradesh Communications Advisor Parakala Prabhakar wrote an article in an English newspaper saying that the condition of Indian economy is bad and the government should take necessary steps to improve it
 needed
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar is sankat se nipatane ke liye koi rodmap nahin pesh kar pai he
 Over five crore rupees have been spent
 kai saal laga die gaye, lekin use bachche nahin hue
 It is being talked about that mountain myna, which is being endangered in Chhattisgarh, which has been declared as the state bird by the Chhattisgarh government
 kuch samay pehle tak ye maina chhattisgarh main bastar, andhrapradesh or odisha ke sarhadiya ilaakon main aasaani se dekhne ko mil jaati thim, lekin ab aisa nahin he
 Concerned by this, the government rectified this and decided to save Maina
 bastar ke van vidhyalay main ek kaaphi lambe-chaude pinjre main ek pahari maina kaa joda rakhaa gaya, taaki bachche paidaa hon or maina kii sankhya badhaai ja sake, lekin das saalon tak kii gayi prajnan kii kai koshishen naakaam sabit huin or yah joda do se teen nahin ho paaya
 Expert doctors from Forest Zoological Institute Dehradun and Kolkata also tried many prescriptions for breeding this myna, but the result was cipher
 van vibhaag ko is disha abhi tak koi kamyaabi nahin mil pai he
 At the same time, to save and increase the number of this myna, the forest department is now insisting on planting trees of the same species in the forests, which like this hill myna
 sarkaar ko lagata he ki pahari maina kaa parivaar prakruti kii god main hi fal-phool saktaa he
 Apart from this, the state government has banned hunting of this myna under the Forest Animals Act
 iske shikaar ke doshi paae gaye vyakti ko das saal tak kii sajaa or jurmaane kaa praavdhaan kiya gaya he
 Natural environment not found: Ram Prakash, Chief Wildlife Warden of Chhattisgarh, says that a tree was surrounded and kept in a myna for captive breeding
 lekin uskaa prajnan nahin ho paaya
 Even if there was an egg, it did not survive
 unka maananaa he ki maina ko prakritik rup se jo vaataavaran chahie hota he vah nahin mila
 Although Maina is given many types of greens from fresh fruits in the cage
 uski sehat kaa bharpoor dhyaan rakhaa jaataa he
 a team of forest department is posted round the clock to guard it
 maina ko bachche paidaa na hone ko lekar van vibhaag kii daleel yah bhi he ki is pinjre ke peeche railway trek or saamne sadakon par hone-vaale shorgul ke chalate is maina kii god ab tak suuni he
 Now the DNA test department of this Maina says that it is very difficult for Mena to identify who is male and who is female
 prajnan kii prakriya ko nae sire se shuru karne ke liye vibhaag maina ke DNA test kii taiyaari kar rahaa he
 a Chief Wildlife Warden of the state also says that much work has not been done on the breeding of birds in India
 prayaas kai kiye gaye hai, lekin safalataa nahin mili
 Manna imitates humans accurately, the main feature of this manis is that it mimics the voice of human beings very accurately
 aapane aamtaur par tote ko hi bolte dekha or sunaao hoga, lekin yah maina insaanon kii boli bol sakati he or tote se kahin zyada saaf aawaaj main
 Why did this beautiful myna disappear? People fond of hunting made this myna their target, then it was killed for carnivores
 natijatan yah pahari maina gaayab hoti chali gai
 There are only a few hill mynas left in the Bastar litigants
 kya chahie is maina ko?pahari maina ko jhil jharne or udaan bharne ke liye khule maidan behad pasand hai
 Usually they nest on banyan, peepal, tejam and semal trees

 Zero is a love story in the trailer
 lekin ye lav story isliye khaas he, kyonki isamen 38 saal ke ek boune ko ek wheel chair par chalane vaali ek ladki se pyaar ho jaataa he
 Zero Trailer: These 8 dialogues make Shah Rukh's film, especially the story of Baua Singh Thakur, resident of Meerut, who has turned 38, but has not been married yet due to dwarfism
 ek roj unke haath anoushka sharma kii photo lag jaati he or ve unhen apana dil de baithte hai
 The metromonials tell Baua that the girl is very moving, but Baua does not understand what this means, when in reality Anushka is seen sitting in a wheelchair, her pigeons fly away
 darasal, baua kabutar haath main lekar pahunchate hai
 Zero Trailer: Shah Rukh's connection to Yeh Hai Meerut begins the love story of the two
 dhire-dhire anoushka bhi baua ko pasand karne lagati hai
 Meanwhile, Katrina Kaif's entry takes place
 darasal, katrina baua kaa bachapan kaa prem hai, lekin baua ke boune rah jane ke kaaran katrina kaa rasta alag ho jaataa he or ve ek badi star ban jaati hai
 Baua also does not forget Katrina
 waapas se donon dost ban jate hai
 Meanwhile, this story takes the form of a love triangle
 saath hi prem main baua kuch bhi karne vaale aashiq ban jate hai
 Shahrukh and Anushka's acting seems to be one sided
 ve bahut had tak barfi kii priyanka chopra jaisi lagi hai
 The film's dialogues are also laughable
 salmaan ne bunon ko bulaakar shahrukh kii jiro ke bare main kahi ye batshaadi na hone se pareshaan ek boune insaan kii kahani abhi tak kisi hindi film main nahin dikhaai gai
 The story is extraordinary, so viewers may like it

 The SC / ST Act Amendment Bill was introduced in the Lok Sabha after approval from the Cabinet, which is to be discussed in the House today
 iske jariye ye saaf ho jayega ki sattadhari dal se lekar vipaksh tak is mudde par kya najaaria rakhte hai
 Explain that on 21 March this year, the Supreme Court had stopped the immediate arrest in cases registered under the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Prevention of Atrocities Act (SC / ST Act 1989)
 court ne faisla dete hue kaha tha ki sarkari karmchaariyon kii giraftaar sirf sakasham athurity kii ijaajat ke baad hi ho sakati he
 Dalit organizations took to the streets on April 2 against the Supreme Court's decision
 dalit samudaay ne do april ko 'bharat band' kiya tha
 The central government was scorched in the heat of protest
 deshbhar main hue dalit andolan main kai ilaakon main hinsa hui thi, jisamen ek darjan logon kii maut ho gai thi
 The Dalit society was expressing its displeasure with the central government, taking the Modi government responsible for the Supreme Court's decision
 centre sarkaar or bijepi ko dalit virdohi bataaya ja rahaa tha
 Dalit organizations have once again given an ultimatum to the government that if by August 9, the law making the SC-ST Act in its old form is not enacted, then they will protest in a big way
 modi sarkaar ne daliton kii naaraazgi ko dekhte hue SC / ST act ko uske mul swaroop main laane kaa faisla kiya
 The government introduced this amendment legislator on Friday in the Lok Sabha after approval from the cabinet
 is sandhoshan vidhyak par aaj sadan main vistrut charchaa honi he
 Given the political power of Dalit votes, it is unlikely that anyone in the House will oppose it today
 is tarah se phir ye apane mulswarup main aa jayega or supreme court ke pherbadal kaa koi matlab nahin rah jayega
 This will be added to the Amendment Bill, Section 18A will be added to the Basic Law through the SC \ ST Amendment Bill 2018
 iske jariye puraane kanoon ko behaal kar diya jayega
 In this way, the provisions of the Supreme Court will be canceled and now this provision will be there - There is a provision for arrest as soon as the case is registered in the SC / ST Act
 -aaropee ko agrim jamaanat nahin mil sakegi, hoicourt se hi niyamit jamaanat mil sakegi
 - Investigation in the case of SC / ST will be done by the police officer of the rank of Inspector
 -jatisuchak shabdon ke istemaal sambandhi shikaayat par turant maamla darj hoga
 SC / ST cases will be heard only in special courts
 -sarkari karmchaaree ke khilaaf adaalat main chargeshit daayar karne se pehle jaanch agency ko athurity se ijaajat nahin leni hogi
 The Supreme Court had made these changes - in cases of SC / ST Act, immediate arrest will not be made
 -shikaayat milane par turant mukadmaa darj nahin kiya jayega
 Initial investigation will be done by DSP level police officer after first getting the complaint
 -jaanch kisi bhi surat main 7 din se zyada samay tak na ho
 The DSP will conduct preliminary investigation and conclude that according to the complaint, whether a case is made or is being falsely implicated in some way? Government servants can apply for anticipatory bail
 -essi / asti act ke tahat jatisuchak shabd istemaal karne ke aaropee ko jab magistrate ke saamne pesh kiya jaae, to us vakt unhen aaropee kii hiraasat badhaane kaa faisla lene se pehle giraftaar kii vajahon kii samiksha kerani thi
 - The arrest of government employees can be done only after the permission of the competent authority
 -disha-nirdeshon kaa ulanghan karne vaale afasaron ko vibhageeya karrwai ke saath adaalat kii avmaananaa kii kaarywahi kaa bhi saamana karnaa padegaa
 But now Modi government is going to reverse this decision through the bill and this will bring SC / ST in its original form

 Also, by submitting a report every month, you will also have to tell how many cases came for forensic investigation and what has been their situation

 The order said, 'accordingly, please ensure that such cases are given top priority and the forensic investigation is completed within a month

 saal 2017 main raajnneeti ke manch se kai hastiyon kaa avsaan ho gaya, to kai sari hastiyon ne daihik sharir tyaag sansaarik duniya se vidaa lee
 Although no one has control over the time cycle, the year 2017 was interesting in terms of political upheaval
 siyaasi bisaat par nae chehron ne jagah lee, to jane-pahachaane dhurandharon ko nepathy main janaa padaa
 If someone's role shrunk in his own team, then the future started to look full of struggles for someone
 aaie ek najar daalate hai inhen raajnneetik hastiyon par
 
 
 Who completed another cycle on their political periphery
 sonia gandhi19 saalon takcongress adhyakshaka pad sanbhaalane ke baad sonia gandhi ne disbanr 2017 main party kii kaman rahul gandhi ko saunp di
 While being the president of Sonia, the Congress achieved many successes and also saw failures
 sonia ne congress ko maranasann haalat se ubaar kar satta main bithaaya, to ye unke siyaasi sooyeeboojh or saahas kaa hi kamaal tha
 In 2004, Sonia returned the Congress to power by defeating the Vajpayee government in the elections, the Congress reiterated its success in 2009 as its President
 rhite tu information or rhite tu food jaisi janonmukhi yojanaon ko shuru karaane kaa shrey bhi unhen hi jaataa he, to manaregaa jaisi yojana se gramin str par bade paimaane par rojgaar srijan karne kaa shrey unase koi chin nahin saktaa
 Sonia may have relinquished the post of Congress president, but she has not left politics
 ve raibareli se party kii saansad he or congress varking kamity kaa hissaa hai
 As he leaves the post of president, his role has been reduced, his health is a matter of concern for the Congress party
 lekin dekhnaa ye hoga ki aazaadee ke baad congress kii purv adhyaksh bhavishya main apane liye koun si bhoomika sweekaar karti hai
 Mayawati's UP assembly elections of 2017 have created a crisis to save existence in front of Bahujan Samaj Party supremo Mayawati
 party kii haalat bahut acchhee nahin he
 The big pillars of the party are leaving him one by one
 loksabhaa chunaav ke baad rajya vidhansabha chunaav main bhi basapa kaa pradarshan chintajanak rahaa he
 In such a situation, the role of Mayavati has been reduced to national and state politics
 mayawati ke saamne party ko ek tareeke se dobaaraa khadaa karne kii chunauti he
 Mayawati herself has been saying that the BSP is not just a party but a movement, then they have to take the party out of their family circle and make it stand again in the face of the movement
 disambar maheene main sampann hue nikaay chunaavon ke nateezon main basapa kaa pradarshan upar chadha he
 
 
 But to stand in the first line of national politics, Mayawati still has to walk for miles

 There was a lot of discord in the Mulayam family before the UP Assembly elections
 akhilesh or unke chaachaaon ke bich sir phutowwal kii naubat aa gai
 When Ram Gopal kept fighting on behalf of Akhilesh, Shivpal supported Mulayam
 
 
 nateeja ye hua ki party main do faad ho gai or akhilesh ne samaajawaadee party par sikaa jamaa liya
 Shivpal and Ramgopalparty kept going in and out and Mulayam continued to celebrate them
 lekin vidhansabha chunaavon main party kii karaari haar ne sapa ko satta se baahar kar diya
 Akhilesh had to face a severe defeat
 lekin akhilesh ne apane pita ko party adhyaksh kaa pad nahin lautaaya
 The party has not had much success in the recently concluded civic elections in the cities
 azamgarh se saansad mulaayam ab party sangrakshak kam pita kii bhoomika main zyada hai
 On November 21, Akhilesh celebrated his father's birthday, neither Shivpal nor Ramgopal appeared in the program
 kabhi mulaayam ke daayan or baayan haath rahe donon bhai ab party kii kendriya bhoomikaaon se pruthak najar aa rahe hai
 Although Ram Gopal is a Rajya Sabha MP of the party, now Akhilesh decides the policies instead of Mulayam

 LK Advani Before the 2014 general election, when the BJP made Narendra Modi the Prime Ministerial candidate, it was understood that in future the party should put its iron man LK Advani on a constitutional post
 
 
 lekin ye sab kayaas hi rahe
 In 2014, the BJP won a major victory in the general elections led by Narendra Modi and did not look back
 modi ke bharosemand amit shah ne party ko upi main loksabhaa kii 70 se zyada siton par jeet dilaai
 From here Narendra Modi and Amit Shah came to the center of the BJP
 party kii nitiyaan or nirnay kaa adhikaar ab unke haath tha
 Narendra Modi made Amit Shah the BJP President and put senior leaders including Advani in the guiding board
 gujarat ke gandhinagar se saansad adwani ne dhire-dhire chuppi odh lee
 When the Presidential election came in 2017, a lot of people hoped that the party could advance Advani
 lekin modi ne bihar ke rajyapal ramnath kovind ko chunaa
 Once named PM in waiting, Advani became one of the proponents of Ramnath Kovind
 modi sarkaar ke teen saalon main se ek 2017 main yah zyada spasht hota gaya ki party main adwani kii bhoomika ab sirf aashirwad dene vaale bujurg kii hi bachi he
 He can be seen in party events and in the corridors of Parliament, but he has remained silent on political issues
 sharad yadavalambe samay tak bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ke sahyogi rahe sharad yadav ke liye 2017 kaa saal utaar chadhaav se bharaa rahaa
 The BJD against which Sharad Yadav played an important role in forming a grand alliance with Lalu Yadav for Nitish Kumar
 unheen sharad yadav ko nitish kumaar ne party main pehle haashiye par dhakela or phir unki rajyasabha sadsyta bhi chin lee
 Sharad Yadav did a lot of work for the grand alliance in Bihar and was also successful in stopping bjp's Ashwamedha horse in Bihar
 lekin nitish kumaar ne 2017 main mahagathbandhan todakar bijepi se haath mila liya
 It was difficult for Sharad Yadav to tolerate this
 unhone iskaa virodh kiya or rashtriya str par is faisle ke khilaaf campan shuru kiya
 But after some time his campaign weakened
 sharad yadav or unke saathiyon ne gujarat vidhansabha chunaav main congress kaa samarthan kiya, lekin khud sharad yadav ke saamne apana raajnneetik astitv bachaane kii chunauti he
 He was neither an MP nor a party
 
 
 unke peeche bahut bada janaadhar bhi nahin he
 It remains to be seen what turn Sharad Yadav's politics takes in 2018

 Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Modi has said that former President Pranab Mukherjee has given a message to end political untouchability in multi-party democracy by deciding to join the RSS program
 susheel modi ne congress par hamalaa bolte hue kaha ki iskaa swaagat karne ke bajaay dushprachaar kii raajnneeti karne waalon kii chaati fat rahi he
 He tweeted, 'dr
 Sarsanghchalak, founder of RSS
 headgavar ke aagrah par 1934 main mahatma gandhi ne wardha main yojit sangh ke prashikshan shivi main bhaag liya tha
 Gandhiji addressed the RSS swayamsevaks in Delhi on 16 September 1947
 'upmukhyamantri ne kaha, 'varsh 1963 main pradhanmantri jawahar laal nehru ke aamantran par sangh ke swayamsevak ganatantr diwas kii parade main sammilit hue
 Accepting the invitation of senior union leader Eknath Ranade, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi inaugurated the Vivekananda Shilam Memorial
 gandhi-nehru ke bare main bhi na jaanane vaale congressi pranab mukherjee par sawaal uthaa rahe hai
 Modi also said that the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh played an important role during the Bihar movement and Loknayak JP joined the Sangh program in 1977 and gave a message to increase ideological dialogue between political parties
 rashtriya sankat, apatkaal or prakritik aapadaa ke samay desh ke saath khadey rahane vaale sangh ko badnaam karne kii sajeesh kabhi kaamyaab nahin hogi
 In fact, many Congress leaders believe that Pranab Mukherjee going to the RSS program is harmful for the party and the 'secular' camp
 in netaaon kaa kahana he ki 'secular' party ke netaa kaa aresas ke mukhyalay jane kaa matlab use ek tarah se manyata pradaan karnaa he, jo ki abhi tak congress ke liye 'asprishy' rahi he or rahul gandhi har bhaashan main jis par hamalaa karte rahe hai
 The discussion of the first 100 days of the Narendra Modi government is also discussed on social media
 twitor par bijepi samarthak or virdohi donon ke bich waar or palatwaar kaa silsilaa chal rahaa he
 BJP supporters are celebrating '100 good days', but opponents are asking for the address of black money
 twitor top trade main subah se # 100acchedin top par he, jabaki virodhiyon kaa # whereisblackmoney tisare number par he
 It is worth mentioning that before the elections, the then BJP President and current Home Minister Rajnath Singh promised to bring back the black money in Thane in 100 days
 vahiin modi ke prachaar par nikle baba ramdev ne bhi april main bhubaneshwar main kaha tha ki sarkaar banane par 100 din ke andar kaala dhan waapas laayaa jayega
 Opponents are now accusing the Modi government of vandalism on the basis of these statements

 # 100acchedin— Narendra Modi Army (@tigernamo)september 2, 2014 In Korba, Chhattisgarh, a women's defense team has been formed to provide protection to girls and women
 is raksha team main mahila police karmiyon or police kii sahayata karne vaale saamaajik sanghathanon ko joda gaya he
 This women's defense team was formed ten days ago
 itane dinon main pehla kol musiibat se ghiri ek ladki kaa aayaa
 The victim girl called and said directly that put my father in jail
 wo mujhe behad pareshaan karte hai
 The victim also told her whereabouts and the defense team requested Sejald to come home
 ladki ne jis andaaj main baatcheet kii thi usase andeshaa ho rahaa tha ki uske saath kuch galat ho rahaa he
 So the women's defense team left for that location without delay
 ghar main dastak dete hi us ladki ne darwaja kholaa or mahila raksha team ke sadasyon ko drawing room main baitha diya
 The suspicion of the women's defense team deepened
 udhar ladki ne aawaaj dekar pehle apni mummy ko bulaayaa or phir papa ko bhi bulaayaa
 After this, complaining in a very innocent way, that his father does not let him talk on mobile and also lets see whatsapp
 kai baar ise lekarpapa use peet bhi chukehain
 He has also scolded her a while ago
 isliye unhen jail main daal dijie
 Inspector Deepa Kewat, who is in charge of the women's defense team, was shocked to see all this
 haalanki unhone pita-putree ko samajhaayaa or team waapas laut gai
 Something similar happened in Etawah, also in Etawah, Uttar Pradesh, in the past, an innocent child had reached the police station to complain to the police about not running their father's fair

 desh ke mukhya nyaayadhish deepak mishra ke khilaaf mahabhiyog khaarij hone ke baad congress ke rukh ne ab kai pechida sawaal khadey kar die hai
 For example, if the Congress files a petition in the Supreme Court, which bench will hear it? CJI is the Master of Roster
 ab unki bhoomika kya hogi? mahabhiyog kaa bhavishya ab kya hoga, ye bada mushkil sawaal ho gaya he
 The matter has become so complicated that the need for a new interpretation of the constitution is now being felt on it
 mahabhiyog par yachika kis anjaam tak pahonchegi, ise in 10 sawaalon ke jariye samajha ja saktaa he
 First question: is the process of impeachment administrative or legislative? First of all it is difficult to decide whether the process of impeachment is administrative or legislative
 jahaan tak iske prashasnic hone par sawaal he, vahaan samvidhan maun he
 If this matter is legislative, then no opportunity to use it has come yet
 yani koi nazeer hi nahin milti
 If the matter is legislative, the judiciary will not interfere in it and if it is administrative, then who will do the judicial review? Second question: Which bench will hear the petition of Congress? If there is a judicial review on impeachment then the big issue is that this petition in the Supreme Court Which bench will hear? If the matter goes to the Supreme Court, then who will decide which bench will hear the petition of the Opposition in which the step of the Chairman of Rajya Sabha is challenged
 teesraa sawaal: sijeai deepak mishra khud par lage aarope kii karenge sunwaayee?chunki mahabhiyog master of roster sijeai deepak mishra par hi he
 In such a situation, the question is, will they themselves hear the petition filed against their impeachment? Doing so does not seem logical
 aise main phir vahi mushkil sawaal kii sijeai nahin to koun karegaa sunwaayee?chauthaa sawaal: sijeai par aarope lagane vaale sheersh chaar jaj kii bhoomika?varishthata kram main sijeai ke baad ke chaar jajon ne isi saal 12 janvari ko deepak mishra par aarope lagaae the
 Number two Justice Chelameswar along with Number Three Justice Tarun Gogoi, Number Four Madan b Lokur and Number Five Kurian Joseph had openly appeared before the media and openly bombarded the CJI
 desh ke itihaas main ye pehla mauka tha
 It was termed as the dark day of the judiciary
 aise main congress kii yachika par in chaar jajon kii bench sunwaayee karengi, ye bhi tark sangat nahin he
 Fifth question: Who will hear if not the top five judges of the Supreme Court? Those who are accused, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court and the senior four judges just after the accused
 yani varishthata kram main sheersh paanch jajon kii bench yachika kii sunwaayee kare, is par sanshay
 In such a situation, justices from number six to number ten are left in the seniority order
 yani varishthata kram se justise e ke sikri, justise sharad bobade, justise aar ke agarwal, justise em ve ramana or justise arun mishra hi bachate hai
 So will these judges bear the responsibility of hearing the petition? Sixth question: CJI will decide who will hear? Since the Master of Roster is CJI Deepak Mishra
 unke paas ye adhikaar he ki ve is maamle ko kisi bhi bench ko saunp sakate hai
 The top five judges are unlikely to hear the petition
 aise main sambhaavna is baat kii zyada he ki yaa to sijeai duusari badi bench banaaenge yaa phir chathe se dasven number ke justise is yachika par sunwaayee karenge
 Former Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi also believes that it would be good if the petition is heard by the number six judge
 saatvaan sawaal: kya mahabhiyog kaa prastaav khaarij karne ke up raashtrapati ke faisle ke baad raashtrapati ke paas ja sakate hai?mahabhiyog kaa faisla manjuur karnaa yaa na karnaa uparashtrapati ke vivek par nirbhar karata he
 They have given their verdict
 aise main raashtrapati ke paas jane kaa rasta bhi band he
 The only way is the Supreme Court
 vahaan bhi sunwaayee kaa sankat he ki koun si bench ise dekhegi
 Eighth question: How strong is the Congress petition on the legal ground? The Vice President has rejected the impeachment motion for lack of concrete evidence
 sijeai ke khilaaf lagaae gaye aaropon ko venkaiya naidu ne kori kalpana qaraar diya he
 Now Congress has to prove that its allegations are strong even on the legal ground before filing its petition
 nauvaan sawaal: agar congress kii yachika par sunavai hui to sijeai chodenge pad?congress maang kar rahi he ki aarope lagane ke baad ab sijeai pad chhod den
 Congress leader Kapil Sibal even announced that he would not go to his court till CJI Deepak Mishra continued in office
 aise main ye bhi sawaal uth rahe hai ki kya deepak mishra sunwaayee puri hone tak pad chhod denge? dilli hoicourt se ritred jaj esen dhingra kaa kahana he ki ye jaruri nahin he
 If the CJI wishes, they can ask the Registrar General of the Supreme Court to refer the matter to another bench
 dasvaan sawaal: kya uparashtrapati ne jaldbaaji main liya faisla?uparashtrapati ke faisle par bhi bahes ho rahi he
 The Congress says the Vice President should have formed a committee that would investigate the allegations
 congress kaa kahana he ki mahabhiyog ke prastaav kii shuruaati prakriya main sabhapati kii bhoomika simit hoti he
 His proposal was rejected without investigation
 congress kaa daawa he ki aaropon ke saboot sibiai or anya agenciyon ke paas he
 Therefore, the investigation should have been done first
 japan or america kii nausaina ne purvi china sagar main sanyukt sainya abhyaas kiya

 According to the newspaper, the purpose of this exercise was to give a stern warning to North Korea

 In this area, there has been a dispute between China and Japan over uninhabited islands for a long time
 japan main ye dweep samooh senkaku or china main diyaou ke naam se jane jate hai
 The US assured the security of the Japanese islands
 The American administration has assured Japan that the Senkaku Islands are covered under a security treaty and if any attack is made, the US will protect them
 vahiin, maamle main japan raksha mantralay ne kuch bhi kehane se inkaar kiya he
 However, the US Navy in Japan said that they are keeping an eye on them
 somvaar ko uttar korea kii ore se chaar belistic missile ke prakshepan ke baad yah sainya abhyaas saamne aayaa he
 Three missiles fired from North Korea fell near the Japan border, which the US is bound to protect under a security treaty

 (input bhashaa se) In the INX Media case, former finance minister p Chidambaram has filed a bail application in the Supreme Court
 chidambaram ne apni yachika par supreme court se jald sunwaayee kii maang kii
 Kapil Sibal, on behalf of Chidambaram, demanded a hearing on Friday
 justise envi ramana ne kaha ki CJI tay karenge ki shuukravaar ko maamle kii sunwaayee hogi yaa nahin
 Justice Ramana referred the case to the CJI
 bataa den, dilli hai court ne chidambaram ko jamaanat dene se inkaar kar diya tha
 Chidambaram has challenged this decision in the Supreme Court
 bataa den, dilli ucch nyaayalay ne somvaar ko ienex media bhrashtachar maamle main unki jamaanat yachika khaarij karte hue kaha ki jaanch agrim charan main he or is baat se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa he ki vah gavaahon ko prabhavit kar sakate hai
 The High Court, while dismissing Chidambaram's plea, made stern remarks that there is no doubt that if the case against Chidambaram is proved it is a crime committed with society, economy, financial stability and integrity of the country
 adaalat ne kaha ki chidambaram ke videsh bhaagane kaa khatra nahin he or is baat kaa bhi andeshaa nahin he ki vah sabooton se chhedchhad kar sakate hai lekin agar unhen jamaanat di gai to vah gavaahon ko prabhavit kar sakate hai
 Justice Suresh Kait dismissed the bail plea, saying that economic offenses are a separate class and constitute a class itself, as it cuts off the root of honesty and purity in public administration
 yah chuni hui sarkaar main janata ke vishwaas kaa khatm karata he
 Chidambaram was arrested on 21 August
 tab se vah hiraasat main hai
 The court said that there is no doubt that Chidambaram has been a strong finance and home minister and is currently a member of the Rajya Sabha
 adaalat ne kaha, ‘‘ vah ucchtam nyaayalay kii baar association ke sammanjanak sadsy hai
 He has been in the bar for a long time as a senior advocate
 unki bhartiya samaaj main gahari jade hai or shaayad videsh main bhi kuch sampark hai
 The judge said, "but he will not directly or indirectly influence the witnesses, but this fact cannot be ruled out given the above facts
" iske alaava, jaanch agrim charan main he
 Therefore, this court is not ready to grant them bail
 ' unke videsh bhaagane ke sambandh main nyaayadhish ne kaha ki aisa passport ko jamaa karaane, luk out notice jari karne or aaropee ke bina adaalat kii ijaajat ke desh se baahar nahin jane (yahaan tak ke nepal or bhutan ke jariye bhi) jaisi sharten lagaakar roka ja saktaa he
 He said, 'no such evidence has been brought on record that Chidambaram has tried to escape from India
 'nyaayadhish ne videsh bhaagane ke mudde par chidambaram kii pairvi kar rahe varisht vakil abhishek manu singhvi kii daleelon se sahmati jataai jabaki solicytor general tushaar mehta kii daleelon ko khaarij kar diya
 On the tampering of evidence, the court said that documents related to the case are with the CBI, the government and the court
 nyaayadhish ne kaha, ‘yachikakarta sansad kaa sadsy hone ke alaava satta main nahin he
 So i do not think there is any possibility of Chidambaram tampering with the evidence
 ' The story of the film 'badlapur Boys' is from Badlapur, a small village in Uttar Pradesh, where the condition of the farmers is suffering due to drought
 aise main ek kisaan vahaan nahar banavaane ke vaaste apni aawaaj mukhyamantri tak pahunchane ke liye aatmadah kar letaa he
 In return he is called a lunatic
 lekin uskaa betaa haar nahin maanata or kabddi ke madhyam se apni aawaaj mukhyamantri tak pahunchaata he
 The theme of the film 'badlapur Boys' is heart touching
 isamen darshaya gaya he ki kis tarah desh kaa garib kisaan apni aawaaj bhi apni sarkaar or netaaon tak nahin pahunchaa paata
 For this reason, they persecute themselves and move towards suicide
 is film ke poster yaa promo ko dekhakar ehsaas hota he ki yah kabddi par aadhaarit film he, magar aisa nahin he
 The film shows not just Kabaddi, but the fabric of the struggle and efforts of the son of a poor farmer has been woven into the environment of Kabaddi
 film main zyaadaatar chehre nae hai, magar unka abhinay apane-apane kirdaar main suut karata he
 Annu Kapoor is cast in the kabaddi coach's role
 film main kuch kamiyaan bhi hai
 There is drama, and also meaningless songs, which seem to mislead its subject somewhere
 'badlapur boij' main vishay eemaandaar he, magar film utani majboot nahin ban pai
 Still it touches the heart, because it shows the love of the village, the fairs in the village, the battle of kabaddi, the burning and most importantly the passion to touch your destination
 film kii patakatha bhale hi kamjor ho, magar film main ek dialog he, "kiya gaya prayaas bada he yaa chota
 
 
 Succeed or fail
 
 
 yah liye gaye sankalp or drudh nishchay se hi tay hota he
 i can also say that director Shailesh Verma's resolve to make a film on this subject is huge
 isliye meri taraf se is film ko 2
 5 stars

 Today, Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi held a rally in Raigad, Maharashtra and attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi fiercely
 rahul ne kaha ki pradhanmantri chunaav se pehle kehete the ki vah satta main aaenge to pakistan kuch nahin kar paaegaa, lekin vahi pakistan lagaataar sijafire kaa ulanghan kar rahaa he
 Rahul said that the Prime Minister kept swinging with the Chinese President and Chinese soldiers infiltrated the Indian border
 aakhir pradhanmantri is maamle par chuppi kyon saadhe hue hai
 At the same time, Rahul also said that the new government is ending all the laws made in the interest of the poor behind closed doors
 rahul ne piem par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki badi baaten karnaa aasaan hota he, lekin karnaa mushkil
 The Congress has helped the farmers and has always fought for the poor
 rahul ne yah bhi kaha ki bijepi kii marketing acchhee he
 When the PM sweeps in a program, it is visible everywhere, but when Chinese soldiers come to the border, there is silence everywhere

 In the case of the suicide of film actress Jia Khan, can her partner Suraj Pancholi be charged with feticide? Although the charge sheet does not mention such sections, the special public prosecutor says that section 315 can be added to the case
 sibiai kii chargeshit ke mutabik jiya ke khat kii forensik report suraj ko kasuurvaar tehraati he
 Jia wrote in it, "you have ruined my life, i have been hurt so much by abortion
 " suraj ne doctor ko bataaya tha ki bachaa hua bhrun baahar nikaalane main usne madad kii
 All these things are mentioned in the CBI charge sheet in the Jia Khan suicide case, but Suraj has a more serious charge of feticide
 tippaniyan In the Jia Khan suicide case, her partner Suraj Pancholi has been accused of abetting suicide so far, but the charge sheet shows how Suraj took the four-week-old fetus out without medical help himself and later flushed it through the toilet

 Suraj's father Aditya Pancholi says that the media is showing a very scary picture

 According to the CBI charge sheet, forensic report of Jia's letter justifies Suraj
 jiya ne usamen likhaa tha, "tumne meri zindagi tabah kar di, garbhpaat se mujhe bahut chot pahunchi he
 "suraj had told the doctor that he helped in taking out the remaining fetus

 The comments jiya khan suicide cese main uske saathi suraj pancholi par abtak aatmahatya ke liye uksaane kaa aarope he, lekin chargeshit bataati he ki kaise suraj ne chaar hafte ke bhrun ko bina doctorl madad ke khud baahar nikaala or baad main toilet ke jariye use flush kar diya
 The charge sheet has not currently imposed Section 315 of IPC on Suraj, which is related to feticide, but the government lawyer says it can be added on the basis of Jia's suicide note
 vishesh sarkari vakil dinesh tiwari ne kaha maamle main or jo bhi tathy aaenge uske aadhaar dhara jodi ja sakati he
 In this case, Suraj's family is planning to challenge the charges in the court

 south ke mashhoor diarectorumar lulu (omar Lulu) apni apakaming film 'dhamaakaa (dhamaka)' se ek baar phir dhamaakaa karne vaale hai
 This entertaining film by Omar Lulu is based on a message related to marriage
 lekin haal hi main umr lulu (omar Lulu) kii 'dhamaakaa' unke liye ek pareshaani kaa kaaran ban gai he
 Actually, 'dhamaka' was to be played for a few seconds in the character of TV superhero 'shaktimaan', in which the film's actor Mukesh was to be seen in the role
 isaki ek jhalak umr lulu ne soshal media par bhi share kii thi
 But this role became a problem for his upmaking film, as 'shaktimaan' producer and actor Mukesh Khanna himself sent notice to Umar Lulu for this
 Dear @iammukeshkhanna Sir, i was informed by FEFKA of your complaint about depicting Shaktimaan as one of the characters in my upcoming movie _dhamaka_ 
 i understand that you are the copyright holder of the character 'shaktimaan', his costume, theme music etc and i should not have tried to use it in my film without your permission
 i sincerely apologize for the oversight and any inconvenience this might have caused you
 Superhero references are popularly used in South Indian movies and so we inadvertently overlooked the copyright concerns
 We intend to give due credit to you in the title credits of the movie
 i would also like to clarify a small misunderstanding in your complaint about the film
 In my film _dhamaka_ , the actor Mukesh does not actually play the character of Shaktimaan
 It is just a 10 second sequence in which a character visualizes Mukesh Sir (actor of DHAMAKA) as Shaktimaan for posing extraordinary health and stamina for his elder age and that is the only part in the movie where the superhero appears
 My writers had originally thought of Superman and i could not help changing it to Shaktimaan because generations of Indians were inspired by Shakthimaan since its inception in DD1 and i am a proud member of that fandom
 Shakthimaan was one of my favorite superheros that made my childhood so exciting and i still cherish great love and adoration for your character
 Malayali's nostalgia is incomplete without the memories of Shaktimaan, the first Indian superhero of Television
 You motivated young minds to harness superpowers from their own selves and fight against injustice in society and we are immensely grateful to you
 i hope you would accept this humble apology
 i also hope this would bring to a close all the controversies in media surrounding this issue
 Sorry Shakthimaan
 Your faithful fan Omar lulua post shared by OMAR LULU (@omar_lulu_) on Sep 15, 2019 at 7:05 am PDT Omar Lulu (omar Lulu) allowed 'shaktimaan' character Mukesh Khanna (mukesh Khanna) for the blast Was used without it
 haalanki, notice milane ke baad umr lulu ne is baat ke liye soshal media par maafee bhi maangi he

 June salary of 76 lakh employees may be delayed
 agar aisa hota he to kareeb 6 maheene ke bheetar duusari baar hoga jab beasenel ke karmchaaree samay par selary paane se vanchit rahenge
 Earlier, employees received their salary for the month of February in the third week of March
 bataa den ki beasenal ke karmchaariyon ko har maheene ke aakhri yaa agle maheene ke pehle varking de tak selary mil jaati he
 Why do you think? According to the Times of India report, BSNL has told the government that the company does not have the money to continue its operations
 company ke mutabik cash kii kami kii vajah se june ke liye lagbhag 850 karod rupee kii selary de paanaa mushkil he
 Pooran Chandra, Senior General Manager, bsnl's Corporate Budget and Banking Division, said in a letter to the Joint Secretary in the Ministry of Telecom, "continuing operations of the company has become a matter of concern due to the difference in revenue and expenses every month
" 
 ' unhone aage kaha ki ab yah ek aise level par pahunch chukaa he jahaan bina kisi paryaapt equity ko shaamil kiye beasenel ke oparations jari rakhana lagbhag naammumkin hoga
 'why BSNL in this situation? If BSNL is in these conditions today, then there are many reasons behind it
 sabase badi vajah company kaa karmchaariyon par kharch he
 In fact, about 55% of the total revenue of BSNL is spent on the salary of the employees

 darasal, beasenel bainkon se lone lenaa chaahati he lekin sarkaar kaa tark he ki company apane sroton se paise ikattha kar apane kharch kaa vahan kare
 However, there are reports in some media reports that the government is considering a new proposal to get BSNL out of the crisis

 BSNL figures came out only after the minister answered questions in Parliament

 Earlier, the company had a loss of Rs 4,786 crore in 2016-17
 is hisaab se sirf 1 saal main 3,206 karod rupee kaa ghaataa hua he
 According to the Kotak Institutional Equities report, bsnl's operational losses in December 2018 have crossed the Rs 90,000 crore level

 kolkata niterides ke match ke dauraan shahrukh khan kii maujuudagi team ke liye bahut ahm hoti he
 Kolkata Knight Riders CEO Venky Mysore said on Monday that the Bollywood star may not be physically in the stadium but his prayers will always be with him
 mumbai cricket sangh (emsie) ne saaf kiya he ki shahrukh khan ko vankhede stadium main unki team ke ipel match ke liye pravesh karne kii anumati nahin di jaayegi
 Asked to ask Venky how Shahrukh's absence would affect the morale of the team, Venky's reply was, 'he will be in the stadium, not physically but emotionally
 ' venki ne kaha, 'isaliye vah bhale hi hamaare saath nahin honge lekin unki duaayen hamaare saath hongi
 It is always good to encourage them with us, but there are other commitments
 'shahrukh par pichley saal 18 may ko vankhede stadium samet emsie parisar main pravesh karne ke liye paanch saal kaa pratibandh laga diya tha
 After kkr's win over Mumbai Indians, they clashed with the security staff and officials of MCA
 haalanki shahrukh ne is baat se inkaar kiya tha ki unhone galat vyavhaar kiya tha or kaha tha ki suraksha staff ne unke bacchon ke saath hathapaayi ke baad hi unhone aisi pratikriya di thi
 In today's Hindu, two more pages have come out from the file of Rafal Deal
 is baar puraa panna chapa he or jo baaten hai wo kaaphi bhayankar hai
 The Hindu report can also be understood in Hindi
 sarkaar baar-baar kahati he ki rafaal deal main koi bhrashtachar nahin hua he
 The same government should also tell us once again why the provision of action was removed if there was corruption in the terms of the Rafale Deal? That too was removed in the meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Defense, headed by the Prime Minister
 kya aapane raksha kareed kii aisi koi deal suni he jisaki sharton main se kisi agency yaa agent se kamishan lene yaa anavashwayak prabhaav daalane par sazaa ke praavdhaan ko hataa diya jaae?modi sarkaar kii kathith rup se sabase paardarshee deal main aisa hi kiya gaya he
 Modi ji can tell which dealer has been removed this condition to save? The Hindu newspaper has printed it in full on the cover of its front page
 agar sab kuch ek hi din chhapata to sarkaar ek baar main pratikriya dekar nikal jaati
 Now he will have to react to this as well
 kya pataa phir koi nayaa note jari kar diya jaae
 When n Ram printed half a page of the note on 8 February, the government issued the entire page
 usase to aadhe panne kii baat kii hi pushti hui
 But the note that has been issued now is even more terrible than that and after reading it it is understandable why the officials were worried about interfering in parallel to the Prime Minister's Office
 en ram ne raksha kareed prakriya kii sharton kaa hawala dete hue likhaa he ki2013main banaae gaye is niyam ko har raksha kareed par lagu kiya janaa tha
 a standard procedure was adopted that no deal can be relaxed
 magar bharat sarkaar ne france kii do companiyon dasson or embidie france ko abhootpurv riyaayat di
 Financial officials of the Ministry of Defense kept stressing that the money should not go directly to the companies
 yah suzav diya gaya ki sidhe companiyon ko paise dene kii bajaae escro acount banaaya jaae
 Put money in it
 yah khaataa france kii sarkaar kaa ho or vah tabhi bhugtan kare jab dasso or embidie france sari sharton ko puraa karte hue aapurti kare
 This provision was also removed
 aisa kyon kiya gaya
 Is this the transparent way? Where is the transparency of giving money directly to French companies and freeing them from the supervision of their government? en ram ne likhaa he ki aisa lagata he ki sarkaar ne supreme court se ye baaten chhipaai hai
 Has the government told the Supreme Court that the National Security Advisor and the Prime Minister's Office have also played a role in this deal? The answer to this question may come from the government or the Supreme Court
 en ram kaa kahana he ki bagair upar se aae dabaav ke in sharton ko hataanaa aasaan nahin he
 In case of unnecessary influence, the provision of punishment must be kept so that one does not join another channel in the purchase process and does not take the contract
 agent or agency kaa pataa chalane par sazaa kaa praavdhaan isiilie rakhaa gaya hoga taaki kamishan kii gunzaaish na rahe
 Now think in Hindi, is it really so difficult to understand what the intention behind removing these conditions would have been? The agreement was signed between India and France on 23 September 2016 in Delhi
 iske anusaar daftaar rafaal aircraft kii supplai karegaa aurambhdhafrance bhartiya vayusena ko hathiyaaron kaa package degi
 In the same month, there was a meeting of Defense Purchase Council headed by Parrikar
 is baithak main kareed se sambandhit aath sharton ko badal diya gaya
 They also include offset contracts and supply protocols
 afaset kantrect ko lekar hi vivaad hua tha kyonki anil ambani kii company ko raksha upkaran banane kaa theka milane par sawaal uthe the
 On 24 August 2016, the Cabinet Committee on Defense chaired by the first Prime Minister approved
 deal se agent,agency,kamishan or anaavashyak prabhaav daalane par sazaa ke praavdhaan ko hataane se jo commercial saplir the unase sidhe bijness karne kaa rasta khul gaya
 MP Singh, AR Sule and Rajiv Verma of the Indian negotiating team had filed a disagreement on this matter
 di hindu ke paas jo dastauez hai usase yahi lagata he ki in teenon ne kaaphi kadi aapatti darj karai he
 On the matter that deals directly with two companies, it is written in the note that the purchase is being done at the level of two governments
 phir kaise france sarkaar upkarnon kii aapurti,industrial sevaaon kii zimmedaari france ke industrial sapliron ko saunp sakati hai
 That is, what is the point of the deal at the level of governments when there is no responsibility of the government
 teenon adhikari is baat ko lekar bhi aapatti karte hai ki kareed ke liye paisa france sarkaar ko diya janaa tha
 Now French companies will be given directly
 vittiya eemaandaaree kii buniyadi sharton se samjhauta karnaa uchit nahin hoga
 Now you think in Hindi
 raksha mantralay ke teen bade adhikari likh rahe hai ki vittiya eemaandaaree kii buniyadi sharton se samjhauta karnaa uchit nahin hoga
 Why were they writing this? After all, why was the government protecting the two French companies from action in the event of corruption? Now only Modi ji can tell why he was kind to not punish for corruption
 kiske liye kii
 Why this favor for two defense suppliers
 en ram ab is baat par aate hai ki is meharbaani ko is baat se jod kar dekha jaae ki kyon bharat sarkaar ne sattar assi hazaar karod kii is deal ke liye france sarkaar se koi guarantee nahin maangi
 If you also make a deal, you will not want to lose money
 bich main koi guaranter rahe
 You do the same when buying a house
 yahaan to raksha mantralay ke adhikari kah rahe hai ki bank guarantee le lijie,sarkaar se samprabhu ganrti le lijie magar bharat sarkaar kahati he ki nahin ham koi guarantee nahin lenge
 For whom was this favor being given? n Ram has written that instead the government agrees to the Letter of Confirmation which has no law status
 usamen yahi likhaa he ki agar supplai main dikkatein ain to france kii sarkaar uchit kadam uthaaegi
 This letter of comfort also came late
 24 agast2016kii mantrimandaleey samiti kii baithak se pehle tak guarantee lene kaa prastaav tha
 That the French government has an account called an escrow account
 usee ke zarie jab jab jaisaa kaam hoga,jitani supplai hogi,un do companiyon ko paisa diya jaataa rahegaa
 Companies will also work on the belief that they will get money after the supply of goods, because it is in their government's account
 lekin raksha mantralay ke nideshak kareed smita nagaraj ise hataa dene kaa prastaav bhejti hai or manzuri mil jaati he
 Why did the Prime Minister approve it? Now remember the report of n Ram, which was published here on 8 February
 us report main yahi tha ki24november2015ko raksha mantralay ke teen sheersh adhikari aapatti darj karte hai ki pradhanmantri karyaalay hamaari jaankaree ke bagair swatantra rup se is deal main ghus gaya he
 This undermines our team's bargaining power
 raksha sachiv ji mohan kumaar bhi isse sahamat hote hue raksha mantri ko file bhejte hai
 And says that it would be appropriate that the Prime Minister's Office stay away from it
 is note par raksha mantri kareeb dedh maheene baad sin karte hai
 On 11 January 2016
 khud raksha mantri file par sin karne main dedh maheenaa lagaate hai
 But financial adviser in the Ministry of Defense, Sudhanshu Mohanty, is not given enough time to look at the file
 14janvari2016ko sudhanshi mohanti note-263main likhte hai ki kaash mere paas puri file dekhne or anek muddon par vichaar karne kaa paryaapt samay hota
 Nevertheless, since the file has to be submitted to the Defense Minister immediately, i would like to make some quick comments from a financial point of view
 mohanti likhte hai ki agar bank guarantee yaa samprabhu guarantee kii vyavastha nahin ho paa rahi he to kam se ek escro acount khul jaae jiske zarie companiyon ko paisa diya jaae
 With this, the French government will have the moral responsibility to complete the supply
 chunki france kii sarkaar bhi is deal main ek party he or supplai ke liye sanyukt rup se jimmedaar he to use is tarah ke khate se aapatti nahin honi chahie
 Mohanty in his note has also objected to the removal of the consensus that had been reached on how the dispute would be settled between the government and the company
 kanoon mantralay ne bhi bank guarantee or samprabhu guarantee kii zarurat par jor diya tha
 In his note sent to the Ministry of Defense
 ab aap khud sochen or hindi main sochen
 Why would any allegedly honest government remove the provision to act on the possibility of corruption in a deal? Why would you deal with 708,000 crore without guarantee? Is it transparency to remove the provisions of punishment in case of corruption? When you think about these questions, you will get the answer
 marxvaadi communist party (makapa) ke mahasachiv seetaram yechuri ne shuukravaar ko kaha ki pakistan chahta he ki narendra modi kii pradhanmantri bane rahe taaki bharat main hindu sampradayikta bade or isse uske yahaan muslim roodhiwaad majboot ho

 However, the girl's family living in Nankana Sahib, Punjab, Pakistan, is still waiting for Jagjit Kaur to return

 isi bich soshal media par isse judi ek blike and white tasviir viral ho rahi he
 It is being claimed that Bigg Boss TV show is promoting 'love Jihad' here
 tasviir main dekha ja saktaa he ki bistar par ek ladkaa or ladki lete hai
 His mood seems to be that this is a picture of his personal moments
 tasviir ke saath daawa kiya ja rahaa he ki isbaar bigboss ne sari hadein laangh di, kashmir se muslim ladke ko bulaayaa or use jaanboojhkar brahman ladki partner di
 (love Jihad) This time in Big Boss, Indian culture and rituals are being blown openly, young boys, girls will share bad together, such culture has never been in Indian culture
 atul kushvaha kaa twitis post kaa archivd varjan yahaan dekha ja saktaa he
 India Today's anti-fake News War Room (AFWA) found the post to be misleading
 jis photo ko abhi lav jihad ko badhaava dene ke aarope ke saath share kiya ja rahaa he, vah big bos ke sijan 9 kii he jo ki 2015 main prasaarit hua tha
 The boy and girl seen in the picture are TV actors Suyyash Rai and Kishwar Merchant
 ye donon hi big bos sijan 9 main pratiyogi the
 Atul Kushwaha, a verified Twitter handle, shared this confusing post on Friday
 unka yah twit 1500 se zyada baar ritvit kiya ja chukaa he or 2500 se zyada logon ne ise like kiya he
 People are also sharing this post on facebook
 reverse search kii madad se hamane paaya ki viral ho rahi tasviir utyub par maujuud video se lee gai he, jo ki oktober, 2015 main aplod kiya gaya tha
 a youtube channel called tellymasala uploaded the video and wrote the caption, "bigg Boss 9: Suyash & Kishwar intimate in front of the camera"
 video ke mutabik, suyash raay or kishwar marchent ne big bos 9 ke dauraan aadhi raat ko ek duusare ko Kiss kiya tha
 On further search, we also got some news, according to which Suyesh and Kishwar got married on December 16, 2016 after being in a relationship for a long time
 haalanki, yah sahi he ki big bos ke maujuuda sijan main ek kashmiri muslim yuvak aseem riyaj pratiyogi hai
 Pinkvilla
 comki khabar ke mutabik, mahiraa sharma naam kii ek mahila pratiyogi se kaha gaya ki ve bathroom kii safai karne ke liye ek partner chun len to unhone aseem riyaj ko chunaa kyonki aseem riyaj bhi mahiraa kii tarah kashmiri hai
 In this way, it is true that a Kashmiri Muslim boy is also a contestant in season 13 of Bigg Boss and he is also a cleaning partner of a Hindu girl but the photo being used on social media is misleading
 pichley dinon khabar thi ki varun dhawan or katrina caff ek film main saath najar aaenge
 But there is a big difference in the fees of both

 Katrina's photoshoot copied? Pictures of Sonakshi discuss Varunun said, "moving forward, you can't do a lot of films, but you keep doing the things you do
 kyonki darshakon ko aakarshith karne main sakasham hai
 "he said," i think i should have reached a certain level in Bollywood in the last 6 years
 lekin mujhe kamyaabi nahin mili
 'there has been a long debate in Bollywood between male and female actors regarding fees
 kai badi actress priyanka chopra, vidya baalan fees ke bade antar ko khatm karne ke liye aawaaj uthaa chuke hai
 There is such a difference in the fees of mail-female, Varun will be directed by 32 and Katrina will be directed by only 7 Cr, Remo d'souza for Varun's upcoming film
 apakaming film ko mana ja rahaa he ki yah film 'abisidi' kaa sikval he
 For the first time varun-katrina will collaborate with Kaif in the film
 ab tak is film kaa naam tay nahin hua he lekin film ko sabase badi dance film bataaya ja rahaa he

 As of 2016, both these players were brand ambassadors of the Amrapali Group and thousands of people had bought flats of this group
 lekin amrapali group ne logon se paise lene ke baavjood ab tak kisi ko ghar nahin diya, jiske baad log harbhajan or dhoni ko soshal media ke jariye lagaataar nishaanaa bana rahe hai

 Hearing is going on in the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court on Section-497 relating to extramarital relations between men and women
 is maamle main centre sarkaar apana halafanama daayar kar chuki he
 Under the adultery law, this section has always been in dispute and it is said to be against the spirit of gender equality

 WHAT SAYS SECTION-497 Under section 497 of the IPC, if a married man has a mutual consent with another married woman, the husband of the said woman can file a case against that man in the name of adultry
 lekin apni patni ke khilaaf karrwai nahin kar saktaa
 Nor can the wife of a man engaged in an extramarital affair take any action against this other woman
 is dhara ke tahat ye bhi praavdhaan he ki vivahetar sambandh main lipt purush ke khilaaf keval uski saathi mahila kaa pati hi shikaayat darj kar karrwai kara saktaa he
 No complaint against such a person will be accepted on the complaint of any other relative or close friend
 kaise chalata he cese, kitni he sajaavaidh sambandh ke aarope yadi kisi purush par sabit hote hai to use adhiktam paanch saal kii sajaa di ja sakati he
 This offense is bailable
 isaki shikaayat kisi police stesan main nahin hoti balki magistrate ke saamne kii jaati he or saare saboot pesh karne hote hai
 When the evidence is sufficient, summons is sent to the person concerned and the case is tried
 kya hai aapattiyanis kanoon ke khilaaf tark diya jaataa he ki ek aisa aparaadh jisamen mahila or purush do log lipt hon, usamen keval purush ko doshi tehraakar sajaa dena langik bhedbhaav he
 Apart from this, the right of the woman to complain to the husband shows the woman's property as husband, because no other relative of the woman can be the complainant in this case

 With the opening of AIIMS in Raipur, the people of the state were hopeful that now they would not only get good treatment but would also be saved from the open robbery of private hospitals in the name of treatment
 lekin aisa sambhav nahin ho paa rahaa he
 Despite the recruitment of doctors in AIIMS, neither the patients are being treated properly nor the doctors are able to survive there
 jwoin karne ke chand dinon main hi yahaan uplabdh doctor istipha dekar raipur ke hi nijee aspataalon main naukari karne lage hai
 The management of AIIMS is being blamed for this
 ames raipur main neurologist, pediatrician, orthoppendic sarjan, sitivies sarjan, anesthologist ne jwoin kiya tha
 But most of the doctors left AIIMS a few days later and went to other private hospitals
 yahi haal plastic surgery or bern unit main tainaat doctoron kaa he
 Doctors joined both the units and went on seeing the ambience of the hospital
 unhone bhi apana istipha ames ko saunp diya
 It is said that surgeons posted in the burn unit were angry that patients were being referred to private hospitals on the management's instructions
 ab haal yah ho gaya he ki plastic surgery or bern unit main doctoron kaa tota ho gaya he
 All cases of burn unit are being referred directly to private hospitals
 jo marij yahaan bhartee ho rahe hai unhen ames prabandhan apane haal par chhod rahaa he
 According to AIIMS Raipur Superintendent Doctor Ajay Dani, doctors were admitted in the burn and plastic unit
 ve seoup ke anusaar kaam bhi kar rahe the, lekin achaanak unhone naukari chhod di
 According to him, a fresh advertisement has been issued for the recruitment of doctors
 haalanki, doctor ajay dani ne yah nahin bataaya ki aakhir kyon doctor jwoining ke baad naukari chhod rahe hai
 After the opening of AIIMS in Raipur, not only Chhattisgarh but also the border states of Jharkhand, Odisha, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra also come here for treatment
 aise main is santhaan main doctoron kii maujuudagi or yahaan kaa maahaul behad myne rakhata he
 AIIMS management will have to consider this
 bataaya to yah bhi ja rahaa he ki ames main marijon kaa acha ilaaj hone se privet aspataalon kaa bhavishya khatre main pad gaya tha
 Therefore, a gang of doctors is trying to weaken this institute under a thoughtful strategy

Will this herald a much needed revolution in India's ways of seeing gay citizens in sexuality? Will it lead to gay marriages as a constitutional right? The Supreme Court may have to give such guidelines that people with alternative sexuality can get support from institutions and law in education, business, medicine and other civil facilities

 In Delhi, no party is close to forming a government and to do so, mlas of opposition parties would be broken or bought and sold

 Now it is also to see how powerful his claim is that his party will get a majority in the elections

 The truth is that at most the Congress can expect some increase in its seats
 padosi rajya haryana main party kaa jaisaa supada saaf hua use dekhte hue kisi tarah kii ummid nahin kii ja sakati
 However, the issue is that the BJP has decided not to form a government by manipulating which is beneficial for it
 piem narendra modi ne apane shashan kaal main aisa koi kaam na to kiya he or na karne diya he jisase unki or party kii vishwasaneeyata par batta lage
 If the government was formed in Delhi through manipulation or purchase and sale, then their credibility would have been smeared
 unka or party kaa vishwaas saatven aasmaan par he
 In such a situation, this decision is not surprising
 isse party ko apni chhavi banaae rakhane main aasaani hogi or ek gandi raajnneeti se mukti mili jisaki vah shikaar hoti
 This is the time for Narendra Modi to build his own and the party's image and he will not want to lose it by forming a government in a small state like Delhi by manipulation
 yah loktantr ke liye bhi ek sahi faisla he kyonki yah ek swasth paripati kii suchak he

 chhattisgarh main fasal beemaa karne vaali companiyon ne kai ilaakon main aisa pintara khelaa he ki kisaan chaaron khaane chit ho gaye hai
 The insurance companies recovered the premium amount due to crop insurance, but when the turn came to compensate for the loss, the insurance companies overcame
 kahin sookhe kii vajah se to kahin jarurat se zyada pani gir jane se or to or aandhi-tufaan sekisaanon keefasalein barbaad hui thim
 When the farmers approached the Agricultural Society to pay the crop insurance amount, it was found that instead of making up for the loss, the insurance companies returned the premium amount
 fasal beemaa ko lekar chhale gaye kisaan insaaf kii guhaar laga rahe hai
 In many districts of the state, insurance companies have given a blow to the farmers

 These farmers have been pushing for a peak of two years to get the amount of crop insurance
 lekin inaki guhaar sunne vaala koi nahin he
 These farmers planted rice and pulses in their fields
 uskaa beemaa bhi karavaaya tha, lekin chakravaati tufaan se ek hi din main khadi fasal chaupat ho gai
 The condition of about four hundred farmers of this village became slim when they reached the society to demand crop insurance money
 sosayadi ke afasaron ne unhen yah kahkar lautaa diya ki beemaa karne vaali companiyon ne unki premium kii rakam hi lautaa di he
 In such a situation, who should give them compensation

 Now these farmers are making rounds of government offices to make up for the loss, but there was no impact on the health of crop insurance companies
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki nuksaan kii bharpai ke paimaane par zyaadaatar beemaa companiyaan phiseddi sabit ho rahi hai
 If they pay cent percent compensation of crop insurance, then they are in danger of drowning themselves
 lihaaja ve nuksaan kii bharpai ke maamle main anakani kar rahi hai
 There are many well-known companies in the list of crop insurance companies, who are increasing their business daily by claiming the help of people in trouble

 The case has been caught in a legal trap due to the return of the premium amount

 So that some action can be taken against such companies, but nothing came out of their hands

 He says that when the complaints of all the cases come before him, he will definitely pay attention

 Apart from the District Collector and Sub Divisional Magistrate, there are about one lakh four lakh complaints from various insurance companies in the Revenue Court

 After surveying the farm barns of the farmers, most insurance companies pulled back in case of compensation to them

 In most of the cases through their lawyers, the insurance companies have played legal stakes and handed over the premium amount of the farmers to the cooperatives through the back door, so that there is no loss of compensation
 unka ye pintara sarkari disha-nirdeshon ko munh chidhaa rahaa he
 The question of the agreement between the insurance companies and the government leaves no stone unturned in praising the crop insurance scheme from the center to the state government, but when such situations arise, then they do not have time to approach the farmers

 The film has not even been released yet that the girls of Delhi became concerned about their image
 haal hi main isaki jhalak dekhne ko mili dilli airport par
 If sources are to be believed, the entire cast who arrived in Delhi for the promotion of the film was walking out of the airport that a girl came running to the film's lead Divyendu Sharma and started expressing displeasure that he was spoiling her image with this film
 
 shikayati lahaze main us ladki ne yah bhi kaha ki kya unhen is baat kaa ilm he ki issedilliki anya ladakiyon kii kitni badanaami hogi ? log unke yahaan rishta jodne se kataraaenge
 It is reported that Divyendu not only listened to the entire talk of the girl, who is constantly speaking in anger, but also explained to him that through this film, instead of girls of Delhi, boys have been targeted who consider girls as easy targets
 
 jab is silsile main divyendu se baat kii gai to unhone kaha, 'yakeen kiijie film ‘dilliwaali jaalim garlfriend’ ke jariye hamane dilli kii ladakiyon ko kahin bhi bura sabit karne kii koshish nahin kii he balki main to hameshaa se yah kahata aayaa hum ki aajkal ke ladke hi aise hai jinke liye ladakiyon ko yah ravaiya apnaanaa hi padataa he
 i explained the same thing to that girl too
 'gauratlab he ki divyendu ke alaava nirdeshak japinder or film main ‘jalim garlfriend’ kaa kirdaar nibhaa rahinprachi mishraka bhi yahi maananaa he ki har practical ladki jaalim he or aisi jaalim garlfrends sirf dilli main hi nahin har jagah hoti hai

 'match fiksar' ke rup main pesh kiye jane se khinn newjiland ke purv harfanmaulaa khilaadi kris kerns ne kaha he ki vah 'ajeeb or bhayaavah' sthiti main hai or unhone brandan mackulam or lu vincent dwaara antarrashtriya cricket parishad (isisi) ke samaksh di gai gavaahi main unka naam lene ke liye unhen latada
 Chris Cairns, who returned to the country after being questioned by the London Metropolitan Police, reiterated that the charge that he was offered to Brandon mccullum to be part of the fixing ring is not true
 43-varshiya kris kerns ne khulaasa kiya ki newjiland ke teen purv khilaadi - purv captain stephen fleming, danniel vittori or kaayle mills - ne bhi is maamle main isisi ko bayaan die hai, lekin in sabhi ne unka naam nahin liya he
 Chris Cairns has not been charged in London for any of the punishable offenses, but has been told that Brandon mccullum has testified against him, and it is claimed that the all-rounder made it to the Indian Premier League (IPL) in March 2008
 Was offered to him during the edition
 kris kerns ne yahaan pahanchane ke baad apane bayaan ko padhate hue kaha, ''kuch logon ne bhale hi media main kuch bhi daawa kiya ho, brandan mackulam ne isisi ke ek bhrashtachar rodhi adhikari ko is kathith peshkash kii report karne se pehle teen saal kaa intjaar kiya
 
 
 '' kris kerns ne ipel ke purv ayukta ke khilaaf manahani maamla daayar karne kaa zikr karte hue kaha, ''yah bhatakaane vaala bayaan he
 
 
 mccullum first reported his allegations to the ACSU unit of the ICC on February 17, 2011
 
 
 yah sirf kathith peshkash ke kareeb teen saal baad to tha hi, balki yah march, 2012 main meri lalit modi ke khilaaf match phixing ke bare main landan hoicourt ke maamle kii sunwaayee se 13 maheene pehle tha
 
 
 Cairns claimed that the charges against him had already been proved before the court
 unhone kaha, ''sunwaayee main, prayek aarope, ki main match phixing kar rahaa tha, jhootha dikhaai diya
 
 
 It is strange that mccullum told the ICC ASCU in February 2011 that three years ago i offered him to fix the match, but still neither he nor the ASCU corruption officer, who recorded his statement, This information was given to the ICC and made known to Modi or anyone else about this disclosure
 
 
 '' Chris Cairns said that Fleming, Vettori and Mills did not name him in any of the statements
 unhone kaha, ''in teen khilaadiyon ne mere khilaaf koi paroksh aarope nahin lagaae hai
 
 
 Cairns also criticized Vincent, with whom he played in the rebel league ICL
 kerns ne is baat par jor diya ki unhone apane kariyar main ek bhi match fiks nahin kiya
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi built the world's highest Statue of Unity in the tribal area of central Gujarat and proved that he definitely fulfills the work he laid the foundation of
 haalanki stachu of unity banane ke samay gujarat kii bijepi sarkaar ne yahaan ke adivasee samudaay ke logon ke saath kai vaade kiye the, jinhen puraa nahin kiya gaya
 For this reason, when the Statue of Unity was dedicated in the name of the nation through the people of the tribal community, it was also opposed by the local people
 vahi virodh aaj adivaasiyon ke man main bijepi ke khilaaf he
 Actually around 100 tribals were tried at that time and the movement was suppressed
 iskaa sidhaa asar adivaasiyon kaa prabhutv rakhane vaali is chota udaipur loksabhaa seat par dekhne ko mil saktaa he
 At the same time, the Statue of Unity is reminding these tribal farmers of the unfulfilled promises of the BJP
 sarkaar kii ore se kisaanon ko unki lee gai jameen ke saamne hi duusari jameen dene kii ghoshnaa kii gai thi, lekin wo jameen ab tak kisaanon ko nahin mil pai he
 Many tribal farmers were displaced from here due to the Sardar Sarovar Dam
 wo bhi ab bhi apni maang ko lekar sarkaar ke saamne ade hue hai
 The farmers repeatedly came to the collector to get their land back with their demands, but the tribals are angry with the government as well as the local leaders for not getting any help from the local leaders
 iske saath hi stachu of unity jab ban rahaa tha, us vakt adivaasiyon se vaada kiya gaya tha ki iske banane ke baad jo rojgaar khadaa hoga un jagahon par bhi adivasee yuvaaon ko rojgaar diya jayega
 This promise was also not fulfilled later and all the work was given to the agency and the agency gave work to outsiders but not to the tribals
 is vajah se bhi adivasee sarkaar se kaaphi khafa hai
 The Government of Gujarat did not strictly follow the law of The Provisions of the Panchayats ACT 1996
 iske tahat gram sabha par sakhti nahin kii ja sakati he
 Under the Gram Sabha, the local administration has to accept the decision taken under the culture, community, tribal customs
 is niyam kaa paalan bhi sthaneey prashasan ke jariye nahin kiya ja rahaa he
 Also, a decision was made to give 25 percent of the income of the Statue of Unity to the Gram Sabha
 jiskaa bhi prashasan paalan nahin kar rahaa he
 Chopper service was also started here to develop this entire place as a tourism project
 lagaataar helicopter kii aawaaj aasapaas ke 7 gaanv ke skulon main aati rahati he
 Because of this, school children are unable to study
 yahi nahin, is puri jagah ko develop karne or yahaan tourism ko viksit karne ke uddesh se sarkaar ne yahaan alag-alag project yahaan par rakhe the
 In this, land of about 72 villages is to be acquired
 isse ab bhi adivasee logon main baari gussa he
 At the same time, the Tadvi society of tribals is very angry with BJP this time, Tadvi society has been with BJP since the beginning
 lekin jab adivasee andolan kiya gaya to tadvi samaaj ke kareeb 100 logon par cese darj kiye gaye
 The area around Chhota Udaipur is largely populated by Tadvi society
 tadvi ke alaava rathva samaaj bhi yahaan bade paimaane par basataa he
 Whereas this time, both BJP and Congress parties have given ticket to the leader of Rathwa Samaj
 is vajah se donon ke bich voton kaa bantwaaraa ho saktaa he
 The Congress had given Ranjit Rathwa of Chhota Udaipur in its first list
 is vajah se unhen prachaar main kaaphi vakt mil gaya he
 Whereas bjp's current MP Ramsingh Rathwa had a lot of opposition
 jis vajah se bijepi namakan daakhil karne ke aakhri din gitaben rathva kaa naam ghoshit kiya he
 Ghataben Rathwa may also have to pay the price of opposition to Ramsingh Rathwa
 gitaben rathva ne ab tak sirf jila panchayat kaa chunaav ladaa he
 In such a situation, Lok Sabha elections are also a new ground for them
 is vajah se unka zyaadaatar daaromadar yahaan ke bhaajapa ke sthaneey sanghathan par he
 For the fans of Bollywood's most famous couples Abhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, this news is very happy
 khabaren hai ki yah real life jodi jald hi onscreen par ek baar phir saath najar aa sakati he
 Director and filmmaker Anurag Kashyap has approached Abhishek and Aishwarya for their next film, India Today reported

 The Supreme Court has rejected the apology of Anurag Thakur, former Chairman of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI)
 haalanki sheersh adaalat thakur ke khilaaf adaalat kii avmaananaa or parajri ke maamle ko band karne ko taiyaar he, lekin court ne unhen bina shart maafinama daakhil karne ko kaha he
 The Supreme Court has ordered him to appear on 14 July
 saath hi sakht taakid kii he ki maafeename kii bhashaa ekadam spasht hona chahie or isamen kisi tarah kaa golmol nahin hona chahie
 The comments adaalat kii avmaananaa or parajri ke maamle main thakur ke maafeename par supreme court ne aadesh sunaaya he
 Anurag Thakur apologized to the court in this case
 darasal sheersh adaalat ne anuraag se kaha tha ki agar unke khilaaf yah sabit ho jaataa he ki unhone bisisiai main sudhaar par adnga nahin lagane kii juthi shapath lee he to unhen jail bheja ja saktaa he
 After this, in an affidavit filed in the Supreme Court, Anurag Thakur had said, 'he had no such intention at all
 agar is tarah kaa najariya ban rahaa he to vah iske liye bina shart maafee maangate hai
 In an affidavit filed by Anurag after issuing notice in the Parjari (misrepresentation before the court) case, he was said to have been a three-time Lok Sabha MP and was living a public life from a very young age
 vah adaalat kaa bahut sammaan karte hai
 He also said that he has not done any such work in which the court has been ignored

 Anurag denied that he had written such a letter to the ICC chairman
 haalanki shashaank manohar ne kaha tha ki anuraag ne unase is tarah kaa patr likhane ke liye kaha tha lekin maine inkaar kar diya tha

 He respects the court very much
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki unhen ab tak aisa koi kaam nahin kiya jisamen adaalat kii andekhi kii gai ho
 On December 15 last year, the court said that prima facie case of contempt and parajari was made on Anurag Thakur as he wrote a letter to the ICC to say that the recommendation of the Lodha Committee to include the CAG representative in the BCCI In fact there is government interference in the board
 anuraag ne is baat se inkaar kiya tha ki unhone isisi chairman ko aisa koi patr likhaa tha
 Though Shashank Manohar had said that Anurag had asked him to write a letter like this but i refused
 pichley saal 15 disambar ko adaalat ne kaha tha ki pratham drushtya anuraag thakur par nyaayalay kii avmaananaa or parajri kaa maamla banataa he kyonki unhone isisi ko patr likhakar yah kehane ke liye kaha tha ki bisisiai main sieji ke pratinidhi ko shaamil karne kii lodha cameti kii sifarish vastav main board main sarkari dakhsandaji he
 Anurag denied that he had written such a letter to the ICC chairman
 haalanki shashaank manohar ne kaha tha ki anuraag ne unase is tarah kaa patr likhane ke liye kaha tha lekin maine inkaar kar diya tha

 com / qit1upbbnk Mumbai Police has issued a notice to Raj Thackeray, who is surrounded by controversies about his statements, saying that he should put his tongue on the head
 If the violence erupts this time, then any action will be taken against him
 vahiin, marathi cinema ke naam par raaj thakare or uddhav thakare ke bich jang chhid gai he
 On this pretext, the two leaders are attacking each other with statements
 uddhav ne kaha ki marathi cinema ke tikat saste hone chahie to raaj ne is par palatwaar karte hue kah diya ki marathi garib nahin hai film par bhi paisa kharch kar sakate hai
 In fact, Uddhav had said that the Marathi man has not had any flow of money which shook and the money fell, so the ticket price should be reduced
 haalanki raaj thakare ko uddhav kaa yah bayaan pasand nahin aayaa
 Raj has retorted that the Marathi man is not poor, if he can spend money on Hindi films, then why not on Marathi films
 bas film acchhee banani chahie
 Bollywood star Shah Rukh Khan appeared in a double role on 'aaj Tak' for the first time in the history of the news channel
 darshakon ke liye ye ek adbhut najaara tha ki sawaal karne vaala bhi shahrukh khan or jawaab dene vaala bhi shahrukh khan
 Two-two Shahrukh did not appear on TV simultaneously
 balki ek-duusare kaa intervyuu karte naje aae
 That is, Shah Rukh also sat on the chair of Star and Shah Rukh and the chair of fans
 amitabh-shridevi kii filmein pasandshahrukh ne is special intervyuu mempani jindagi ke tamaam rajkhole
 He said that he is a fan of all the actors in Bollywood who do a good job
 shahrukh kii maane to wo filmi duniya main kadam rakhane se pehle amitabh, rishi kapur or shridevi kii filmein dekha karte the
 Even today, he is convinced of the acting of these artists
 bachapan main mimicri karte the shahrukhshahrukh ne bataaya ki jab ve chote the to ramlila main vanar kaa role kiya karte the
 He loved to mimicry
 ek shahrukh ke sawaal kaa jabaav dete hue duusare shahrukh ne kaha ki wo bachapan main prithviraj kapur, devanand, or amitabh bachchan ke mimicri kiya karte the
 However, he said that he had difficulty in mixing Dilip Kumar
 5 minute kaa raaj nahin khole shahrushapani aane vaali film 'fain' ke bare main shahrukh ne bataaya ki film main unase kaha jaataa he ki 'aapkaa 5 minute mil saktaa he', unhone kaha ki ye paanch minute kaa raaj jaanane ke liye film ko dekhnaa jaruri he
 Because this is the story of the film around it
 phens se milanaa shahrukh ko pasandshahrukh ne kaha ki nijee jindagi main logon se milane main vishwaas rakhata hum
 If i go for a shooting somewhere, take some time and meet people
 phans ke bahut khat hai jise kabhi padhuunga
 If Shahrukh believes, he does not let the influence of social media negative talk on him
 ladkiyaan meri zyada fain hai: shahrukhshahrukh ne kaha ki phens se milanaa unhen acha lagata he
 Many fans constantly write letters to him
 10-20 phens aise hai jinase main saalon se miltaa aa rahaa hum bhale hi unka naam yaad nahin he
 But i recognize it on seeing the face
 shahrukh ne kaha kildkiyaan meri zyada fainhai
 Also, Shah Rukh said that some people are fans in which he named Sachin during the interview
 rahul gandhi kii do dinon kii jharkhand yatrake behatar prabandhan ke liye rajya congress ke netaa kaaphi chaukas the
 He wanted to show the Congress General Secretary everything good, perhaps because when his ceremony was being arranged in Mecon's Community Auditorium in Ranchi, some senior party leaders instructed that there should be no shortage
 udhar, rahul shaayad kendriya mantri jairam ramesh se rajya congress ke bare main jaruri feedback le chuke the jo har maheene jharkhand aate rahete hai
 Before addressing the party workers, Rahul must have read the account of the achievements of the state Congress printed on bright paper which he did not include in his speech
 unhone apane iraade saaf kar die, ''jo netaa teen baar chunaav haar chuke hon unhen chunavi raajnneeti se sanyas le lenaa chahie
 He was seen rolling up his sleeves several times during the speech
 ve behatar kaam ke liye protsaahit kar rahe the or apni naaraazgi bhi jataa rahe the
 He was angry that factionalism was at its peak in Jharkhand and party leaders had cut off from the public
 pichley kuch saal main jharkhand congress aadhikarik rup se do faad ho chuki he
 One camp is headed by State Congress President Pradeep Kumar Balmuchu while the other is headed by Union Tourism Minister Subodh Kant Sahay
 rahul ne spasht sanket die ki ve 2014 ke chunavi mishan ke lihaaj se rajya congress ko durust karnaa chaahate hai
 In the last Lok Sabha election, his party could win only one seat while in the last assembly election, the Congress was able to win 14 seats on the basis of electoral coordination with Jharkhand Vikas Morcha (JVM)
 rahul gandhi kahaniyon ke madhyam se sanket dete rahe ki ve jameen se kate hawaii netaaon ko tikat dena pasand nahin karenge so unhone bataaya ki gym jane ke dauraan akasar unki mulaakaat haryana ke ek yuvak se hoti thi jisane chunaav ladgaye kii ichha jaahir kii, ''maine usase kaha ki apana biodata bhejo
 When the state leadership sent me the list of candidates, its name was above all in it
 maine uskaa naam katwa diya, kyonki vah jameen se judaa nahin tha
 "but this story is not a cure for misdeeds and certainly not in Jharkhand
 bilkul sust or lachar pad chuki rajya congress pramukh vipakshi dal kii bhoomika main ekadam nahin dikh rahi he
 From the assembly to the agitation, Babulal Marandi, the head of the JVM has taken up this role
 vakt-bevakt congress ko chunauti dene vaale marandi ne spasht sanket de diya he ki ve congress se aage koi talmail nahin karenge
 In such a situation, Rahul Gandhi will either have to find new allies for 2014 or he will have to burn his life to walk alone in the party
 hindipattee ke rajyon main rahul beshak taaliyaan bator lete hon lekin ye taaliyaan vot main tabdeel nahin ho paa raheen
 One election defeat after another in Jharkhand has put the party in a strange state of chaos
 party ke aantarik matbhed hinsak jhdapon or saream tokataki main badal chuke hai
 Sahai's younger brother Sunil Sahai, who was contesting on a Congress ticket in the recently concluded Hatia Assembly by-election, not only lost the traditional seat of the party but also could not save his bail
