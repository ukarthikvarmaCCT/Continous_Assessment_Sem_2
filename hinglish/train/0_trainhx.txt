 Everyone wants to know the secret of a cup of tea in Bihar

 In fact, on Sunday, while visiting the flood relief camps, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar reached the village of senior RJD leader Abdul Bari Siddiqui, where he was welcomed with a cup of tea

 ant main khulaasa hua ki bachche ke hansane kii aawaaj asal main seenaa pujari ke mobile kii ringtone thi
 So every evening whenever he would call on his phone, the 'ghostly' voice used to come from the tree

The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) has unannounced in the preparations for the Mission 2019
 pehle banaras, phir agra or iske agle din meerut main 'rashtrodayah swayamsevak samagam' ke jariye aresas pramukh mohan bhagwat ne bhale hi koi siyaasi baat nahin kii, lekin jo bhi kaha, us par bagaiyr raajnneeti ke amal sambhav nahin he
 That is why the Sangh has come up with a new definition of 'hindutva and bigotry' by giving a message of equality from non-political platform in ethnic and ideological differences, in which Hindutva means whole country and fundamentalism means liberality
 lekin siyaasi nihitarth vaala sangh kaa yah agenda kya vastav main un jatiyon or vichaardhaaraon ko aakarshith kar paa rahaa he jo raajnneeti ke maidan main bhaajapa ko virdohi yaa khud ko 'bhagava peedit' maanati hai?yah jaan lenaa jaruri he ki yah sawaal kyon uthaa or aresas ko soshal ejineering kii jarurat kyon padi? darasal, 2014 ke aam chunaav main jin hindu maton kaa dhruvikaran bhaajapa kii taraf tha, unamem anya pichhadaa varg or daliton kii nirnaayak taadaad shaamil thi
 This equation remained intact in the 2017 Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections but decreased in the proportion of 2014
 iske peeche bhaajapa shasit rajyon kii ghatnaon ke alaava bihar chunaav se pehle sangh pramukh mohan bhagwat ke aarakshan khatm karne vaale bayaan ko bhi dekha jaataa he
 The social engineering of the Sangh has increased after the incidents of ethnic violence between Dalits and Rajputs in Shabbirpur village of Saharanpur district after the formation of BJP government in Uttar Pradesh
 pradesh main is par sakriyata or satarkta saaf dikhaai detii he, kyonki kendriya satta tak pahunchane kaa rasta uttar pradesh ke bina sambhav nahin he
 In 2014, the BJP and allies got 73 Lok Sabha seats from UP itself and western Uttar Pradesh had a significant contribution in this
 tab mujffarnagar dangon ne bhi bhaajapa ke paksh main ekatarfa dhruvikaran kiya tha or aaj ve halaat bhi badal chuke hai
 Apparently, the Sangh has had to change its social engineering formula a bit
 pehle isamen vishuddh hindutv tha, lekin ab hindutv main jatiyaan bhi hai
 On the second day of Meerut's 'rashtrodaya: Swayamsevak Samagam', on February 25, Sangh chief Bhagwat gave a message in his address to over two lakh volunteers, "one should have bigotry for generosity and non-violence
" tyaag or sanyam jaise mulya kisi ek puja yaa sampradaay ke nahin hote
 Radical Hindutva refers to staunch non-violence and staunch liberalism
 ham khud ko bhul gaye hai or jatiyon main bantakar ladaai karte hai
 The whole world bakes bread on the fire of our quarrels
 ''bhagwat pehle bhi kah chuke hai, ''bharat main rahane vaala har vyakti hindu he
 "this time he has disputed this controversial comment," he said, "the person who is a descendant of Indian ancestors is a Hindu
 isliye hamen samaaj ke har vyakti ko gale lagaana chahie
 "indeed, a large hoarding was clarifying the message of Bhagwat's Meerut address on February 23 at Agra's 'samrasata Sangam' stage
" hording ke thik bich main shabari ke haathon se ber khate bhagwaan ram or iske irdagird sant ravidaas, sant kabirdaas, maharishi valmiki or gautam buddha ke chitra or thodi duuri par duusare manch par virajman sabhi samaaj ke sant or mahatma
 That is, from Varanasi to Tajnagri Agra and Meerut the message is clear that the Sangh has started connecting the castes before 2019
 sangh ke aise samagam pehle bhi hue hai par pehle bhagava ke saath nila rang kabhi najar nahin aayaa
 In Agra, on the blue banner below the platform of saintly mahatmas, "the stream of discrimination will break with the harmonious life, only this whole nation has become ours
" '' meerut main samagam sthal ko raat main neeli lite se roshan kiya gaya tha
 Apparently, the Sangh's stay here was important for the BJP, which had lost Meerut in the recently concluded municipal corporation elections, but the blue light did not prove to be enough to attract Dalits and no big face of Dalits could be seen
 haalanki har roj daawey kiye gaye ki samagam main shabbirpur ke hinsa peedit dalit or thakur ekta kaa sandesh denge
 But the distance between Shabbirpur and Meerut remained the same
 iske peeche kii ek badi vajah bataate hue piples union for civil liberties, uttar pradesh ke sachiv ramkumar kehete hai, ''har baar sangh aage aata he, gale lagane, jati jodne kii baat karata he lekin jati todane kii pahal nahin hoti
 In the ten months of BJP rule in UP, the incidence of Dalit oppression has increased by almost 20%
 sangh in par kabhi bhaajapa se pratyaksh javabdehi nahin karata
 However, there is a big reason for opposition of the Dalits in the Meerut conference
 samagam se pehle lagaae gaye hording ko daliton ne meerut bhar main yah kehete hue ukhaad phenkaa tha ki in par dalit mahapurushon ko 'achhut' bataaya gaya he
 Perhaps this is the reason why the Sangh's congregation did not attract Dalits as expected and the Sangh had to give the message of social engineering from another way
 yah rasta tha swayamsevakon ke liye bhojan kii vyavastha kaa jo daliton ke prabhaav vaale gaanvon se mangavaya gaya tha
 The second way was for maximum participation of the village, women and youth and the Sangh seems to be successful to some extent especially in western UP
 sangh ke praant prachaar pramukh ajay mittal bataate hai, ''2014 main jab bhaajapa centre kii satta main ai to sangh kii kareeb 2,400 shakhaaen akele meerut main hoti thim
 Now this number has increased to 4,500
 pashchimi upi se do lakh se adhik nae sadsy jude hai
 "how many Dalits were there?" There is no verified formula to count it, but it is definitely that Dalits are among the priority of the Sangh
 par basapa ke sansthaapak sadsy or ab buddha mahasabha se jude raghubir singh buddha isse sahamat nahin
 He says, "we are made to feel brotherhood only for political need
" ''lekin aisa nahin ki sangh ke prati daliton main keval virodh hi ho or isiilie sangh apane lakshya se vichlit dikhaai nahin detaa he
 Siddharth Biltoria, who came to the congregation from Hastinapur, a Dalit-dominated historical region, says, "we should not ignore the occasions where we realize the right to equality
" saamaajik or rajnatik avasaron par ye alag bhale hi hon
 “it is clear that Dalits are not only an opportunity for the Sangh or politics, but for them also such organizing opportunities
 ab sangh jin jatiyon ko saadhane kii jugat main laga he, ve hi kahin na kahin kattarta se upji nakaaratmakataa or prabhaav se peedit bhi hai
 In such a situation, the separation of Sangh and BJP cannot be seen on this social engineering, because the strength of the entire Hindutva that the Sangh is talking about is for the BJP to be the biggest beneficiary, and all its dependents depend on that the caste affiliation till 2019 How much will it be possible? *** Mehbooba Mufti will take oath as the first woman Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir on Monday

 maujuuda bajet main kii gai fasal ke nunatam samarthan mulya sambandhi ghoshnaa kisaan sanghathanon ke gale nahin utar rahi he
 Farmers' organizations, angered by the msp's miscalculation, have now announced a nationwide protest from February 7 to warn the government, which will continue for a week
 kisaan sanghathanon kaa aarope he kii centre sarkaar ne 2019 main hone vaale loksabhaa chunaavon ko saamne rakh kar kisaanon ko lubhaane ke liye unki aamadani badhaane or nunatam samarthan mulya ko laagat se dedh guna karne kii baat to kii he, lekin ye sab kagaji he
 This is the argument of farmer organizations 1
 sarkaar kaa kheti kii laagat tay karne kaa tarika galat he kyonki vah kisaan yani parivaar ke mukhiya ko chhod kar uske parivaar ko akushal majdoor maanati he, jabaki kisaan kaa puraa parivaar kheti karata he
 Therefore, the whole family should be considered a skilled worker
 2
 While fixing the cost of cultivation, the rent of the land should also be added because a large section of the farmers do farming by renting the field
 3
 The government gives some concessions in the name of subsidy to the farmers but reduces the subsidy while fixing the cost of farming
 kisaan sanghathan chaahate hai kii sarkaar emspi tay karte samay sabsidi ko laagat se naa ghataae
 According to the Secretary of the Indian Kisan Union, Dr
 Sudarshan Pal, the MSP fixed by the government will not be able to get even one-and-a-half times the cost of cultivation of the farmer
 isliye emspi kaa nirdhaaran sahi ho or uske liye alag se koi fund kaa praavdhaan ho
 According to Dr
 Sunilam, president of Rashtriya Khet Mazdoor Sangathan, the BJP government has definitely talked about the market support price, or MSP, in the budget, but has not made any budget provision for it
 unka maananaa he ki sarkaar emspi kii baat to karti he lekin is baat kii guarantee nahin detii ki har haal main kisaan kii upaj kharidi jaaegi
 Trade unions are demanding that the government tighten and punish agents who do not buy produce

 Announcements made for farmers in the budget are not practical
 Farmers' organizations have described the budget as round
 kisaan mukti sanghathan ke adhyaksh ve em singh ke mutabik vitt mantri arun jetali ne emspi ko kuchalane kaa kaam kiya he, jo kisaanon ke saath ek khilwaad he
 Actually the central government is stuck by mentioning MSP in the budget
 kisaan sanghathan aarope laga rahe hai kii pichley chaar varshon main desh main 16 hajaar se adhik kisaan aatmahatya kar chuke hai or kisaanon kii aamadani badhane kii bajaae kam hui he

 ’’ When Gurugram happened in Gurgaon, no one had said that there would be no traffic jam
 ab jab log paanch se chah ghante jam main fanse hai tab jaakar logon ko naam badalane kii vyarthta samaj ai he
 This awareness, which comes in annoyance and annoyance, also has some basic problems
 jam kaa sambandh na to puraane naam se he na nae naam se
 On Thursday night, when people got stuck in a twelve-hour jam, their endurance was answered
 vaise ab ham rose dedh se do ghante jam main bitaane ko lekar sahaj ho chuke hai
 Anger came as to why it took four hours, why it took five hours
 tasviren vaaki daraane vaali hai
 Being stuck in a jam for four to eight hours, the body bladder and the radiator of the vehicle would have started to respond
 wo din dur nahin jab kaaron main apatkaali baio toilet banane lagenge
 This jam in Gurgaon has made people cry
 madhyamvargeey jivan ke do pramukh sapanom main se ek car ko log raste par hi chhod paidal apane duusare sapane kii taraf chal diye jise ham flats kehete hai
 Many cars died prematurely i
e
 the engine ceased
 inaki marammat par kitna kharch aayega, daftaron se iske liye chuttee milegi ki nahin, ram jane
 The ambulance was also trapped, but a group of conscious citizens left their worries and somehow pulled out the ambulance
 pichley bees saal main hamen do hi to sapane beche gaye hai
 Dream of a car and a house

 In a city where there are hundreds of IT companies and in the coming days these companies are selling apps to solve some problem of India, not one of them has been able to make such an app which can liberate us from such a jam
 balki ulta log gurugram ke iti city kahe jane ko hi gariyaane lage
 His patience began to break
 ve milinium city kahe jane ko gariyaane lage
 Then, after taking away the moral burden of Indian culture, they started calling themselves Gurugram
 logon ko yah bhi khyaal nahin rahaa ki gurugram kaa mazaaq udaane par guru dron kaa mazaaq ud rahaa he
 News channels were not free from fake nationalism or else they used to call the people trapped in the jam from traitor to criminal
 batch gaye gurugram vaale
 When the pictures of the jam started going viral on Twitter, the light of the cars actually started looking like that darkness, which no one was thinking of the way to overcome
 logon ko laga ki twit kar dene se shahari vyavastha main sudhaar aa jayega
 Government will do something to save the image
 jaisaa logon kaa satahi gussa vaisaa hi sarkaar kaa satahi upaay or aashwaasan
 Information came that two officers were being sent

 Now we talk about the reactions of the Twitter world, which has not been claimed till 5000 years ago
 gurugram main twitor kaa naam abhi tak twitor hi he
 It is very difficult to understand the mental tortures of those trapped in a sixteen hour jam

 Welcome to Millennium City Gurgaon haryana kii kareeb 35% aay gudgaanv se aati he
 Gurgaon has many names
 gurugram naam kii ghoshnaa hui he magar notification jari nahin hua he
 The government did not release the notifications but the media started writing Gurugram
 hindustan times ne 21 may 2016 ko ziladhikari tii el satyaprakash kaa bayaan chapa he ki gudgaanv ko gurugram karne kaa koi notification jari nahin hua he
 In the order issued by the District Magistrate on Friday, Gurugram is also not written, but Gurgaon is written
 jabaki gurugram karne kii ghoshnaa 12 april ko hui thi
 When it takes so much time to change the name, understand that it will take two years to build a drain and install a traffic light
 gurugram se pehle logon ne gudgaanv ko pyaar dulaar se bharat kaa singapore kaha, iti city kaha, milinium city kaha
 Now the residents of this place are also mocking these names
 yahaan tak guru dron ke naam par rakhe gaye gurugram ko lekar mazaaq udaaya gaya, maukey kii nazaakat ko dekhte hue aisi baton par aahat hone waalon kii toli bhi ignor karne lagi
 just as well
 vaise bhi log aadhunik shahar kii haalat se naaraaz he
 Traffic jams would not happen in the mythological period
 baharhaal jam se itnaa khuf fail gaya ki prashasan ne skulon ko band kar diya
 And that section 144 was imposed which is imposed at the time of every stream
 chaahe aap dhara ke saath bahen yaa dhara ke kilaaf bahen, dhara 144 ke bina aap kahin nahin bah sakate hai
 Flood, drought, storm, dharna demonstrations are all Section 144
 prashasan kii nigaah main prakritik or janatantric donon hi aapadaa hai
 That is why Section 144 is used to stop the democratic upsurge, the same happens during natural storms

 Gurgaon district magistrate TL Satyaprakash has said that there has been unprecedented rainfall in Gurgaon

 Huda is here to build the infrastructure
 haryana deveopment athurity ko huda kehete hai
 Master Road, Master Sewage, Master Drain, Water Supply is made by HUDA
 houseing sosayadi ke bheetar kaa dhaancha, sadak se lekar sivej tak builder ke jimme aayaa
 In a way, the responsibility of the government was to build an external road or drain
 rathi sahab ne bataaya ki yahaan ke resident welfare association kii taraf se bahari vikaas ke naam par 17,000 karod rupee huda ko diye gaye hai
 The Gurgaon Citizen Council has also filed a case in the Supreme Court regarding the tax being levied on us and where it is being spent
 2013 main huda ne supreme court main likhit halafanama diya tha ki huda ne metro ko milakar 17000 karod main sirf 5500 karod hi kharch kiye hai
 HUDA has no budget
 jahaan vibhaag ko uchit lagata he vibhaag kharch karata he
 Rathi ji said that the Municipal Corporation was established in Gurgaon in 2008 but the Municipal Corporation was not given any rights till 2013
 house tex se jo paise aate hai wo nagar nigam ke paas rahete hai or stamp duty se jo paise aate hai wo rajya sarkaar nigam ko nahin detii he
 i wish we had the government as well, but according to Rathi ji, the result is that the Municipal Corporation does not have money for development
 regular staff nahin he
 Gurugram has 35 wards
 prati ward kareeb 25-30 safai karmchaaree yaa nigam karmchaaree hai
 This number is not sufficient according to the need of the city
 nigam kaa prastaavik bajet 1600 karod kaa he lekin unhen miltaa 400 karod he
 Unless we are not interested in these questions, Gurugram will not benefit from Section 144
 rathi ji ne kaha ki sohana road ke saath-saath badshaah poor naala guzarataa he
 Through this drain, the water of Gurugram used to pass through Hero Honda Chowk to the Nazafgarh drain
 is dren ke upar haive bana diya gaya or iske swaabhaavik pravaah ko band kar diya gaya
 As a result, the water of Badshah Pur Nala started coming up and filled the same city back
 iskaa nateeja yah hua ki pehle jaipur haive block ho gaya
 Six six feet of water was filled
 kai gaadiyaan dub gayi
 After that Mehrauli Road was blocked
 jitne bhi sector road hai gurugram ke wo saare black hote chale gaye
 Vehicles started getting stuck
 haalat yah ho gai ki raat ko border security force ko bulaayaa gaya, phir bhi sadak khul nahin pai
 Rathi Sahab said that the anger of the people is powerful
 sadak khulte hi bhul jaaenge
 They said that they have been fighting over these issues for fifteen years, but people do not come
 naam ko lekar tukbandi ke zariye logon kaa yah gussa bataata he ki ham buniyadi sawaalon se kitne dur ho gaye hai
 We have been suffering from traffic jams for many years
 dilli mumbai, bangaloru ke log
 The people of Bangalore have now started catching fish in the rainy waters
 saanp bhi nikal aayaa
 If we continue to occupy the land of animals and settle in a smart city, then one day they will come out and come to wrap in our feet
 tivi kaa media kisi farzi rashtrawaad kaa kissa roj sunaakar aapako bhadakaata rahata he lekin aise sawaalon par tabhi lautataa he jab aap kisi jam main funs kar baukhala jate hai
 Such accidents are happening continuously in our cities
 ham lagaataar bhoolatey ja rahe hai
 On July 26, 2005, that is, 11 years ago, Mumbai received about 1000 mm of rain, in which hundreds of people drowned and died
 kai logon kii maut usee car main ho gai thi jisamen baithe baithe ghar ja rahe the
 The Maharashtra government had told the High Court that 1498 people died due to rain and subsequent illness
 pichley saal chennai main bhi ham sabane bhayankar tabaahi dekhi thi
 In Chennai alone, 269 people died
 kai kaarnon main kuch kaaran yah bhi the ki nadi kii zamin par kabja ho gaya
 Houses were built
 ham aksar samajhate hai ki nadi suukh gai he magar yah nahin dekhte ki pani upar se bhi aa saktaa he
 At such a time, flooding is not fatal due to the spread of water on the river's expanding land
 mitti ke upar cement kii paraten bichaai ja rahi hai or talab yaa pani ke vistaar kii zamin ko kabje main lekar sapanom kii sosayadi ban rahi he
 We have a strange media problem
 shaharon main baadh jam ko lekar kitne uttejit ho jate hai kyonki ab ke media par shahari logon kaa hi kabza he
 The same urban people who have occupied the land of the river drains of the city
 varna baadh to hindustan ke ek bade ilaake main bhi ai he
 The media is also showing those news but not in response to the anger and excitement which caused everyone to become restless about Gurgaon
 tippaniyan Our colleague Alok Pandey is continuously filing reports on this
 unki report ke anusaar assam main 17 lakh log baadh se visthapit hue hai
 Hundreds of villages in Upper Assam are submerged
 2000 raahat shiviron main log rah rahe hai
 Surely, relief work is going on fifty times more than the scale of Gurgaon
 is bhayankar baadh main marane waalon kii sankhya 21 bataai gai he
 Now you understand this difference
 jahaan jahaan nadi ke pani ko failane kii jagah he vahaan vahaan bhayankar baadh ke baad bhi marane waalon kii sankhya kam he
 Hundreds of people died in Mumbai, Chennai by drowning on the city road which we think is better and safer than the village
 ab agar ham in sawaalon ko nahin samajhenge to twitor par jitna marzi likh len, hona janaa kuch nahin he
 Just find out the natural areas of your city where the rainy water will sometimes spread
 kya hua un prakritik ilaakon kaa
 The secret of the Gurgaon tragedy lies not in the traffic jams or overflows of the drain or the reduction in the number of employees of the corporations
 in tasveeron main bhi he jo aap dekh rahe hai
 You will have to face such a situation when you will only make a way for cars to leave the city, and do not make a way for water to leave
 aane vaale dinon main isse bhi buree sthiti hone vaali he
 The jam of Gurgaon is being called Gurujam
 guru shabd kii aisi fajihat hamane kabhi nahin suni
 i had not read the prophecy in any scripture about how good it was to be a guru in ancient times, in modern times, Guru would mean Gurujam
 gudgaanv main 40 se 50 mimi ke bich barish hui he
 These rains are not very severe during the monsoon days
 aam hi maani jaati he, phir bhi aisi haalat kyon hui
 The photos are really intimidating
 chaar se aath ghante tak jam main fanse rahane se sharir kaa blader or gaadi kaa radiator jawaab dene laga hoga
 The days are not far when emergency bio toilets will start being built in cars
 gudgaanv ke is jam ne logon ko rulaa diya he
 One of the two major dreams of middle-class life, people left the car on the road and walked towards their second dream, which we call a flat
 kai kaaron ne samay se pehle praan tyaag diye yani ingine seez ho gaya
 How much will be spent on repairing them, offices will be discharged for this or not, Ram knows
 ambulance bhi funs gaya lekin jaagruk nagarikon kii toli ne apni chintaa chhod kisi tarah ambulance ko bhi nikaala
 In the last twenty years, only two dreams have been sold to us

 Even the Gurugram named after Guru Drona was made fun of, in view of the chance of opportunity, the group of those who were hurt on such things started to ignore

 We have taken some information from its chairman RS Rathi
 yahaan par buniyadi dhaancha banane kaa kaam huda kaa he
 The Haryana Development Authority is called HUDA
 master road, master civej, master drenaj, water supplai banane kaa kaam huda kaa he
 The structure within the housing society, from road to sewage, came to the builder
 ek tarah se sarkaar ke jimme bahari sadak yaa naale vagraih banane ke hi kaam aae
 Rathi Saheb said that Rs 17,000 crore has been given to HUDA in the name of external development by the Resident Welfare Association
 gudgaanv citigen council ne supreme court main ise lekar cese bhi kiya he ki hamaare upar jo tex lage hai wo kahaan kahaan kharch ho rahe hai ye bataaiye
 In 2013, HUDA gave a written affidavit in the Supreme Court that HUDA spent only 5500 crores out of 17000 crores including metro
 huda kaa koi bajet nahin hota he
 The department spends where it deems appropriate
 rathi ji ne bataaya ki gudgaanv main 2008 main nagar nigam kii sthapana hui lekin nagar nigam ko 2013 tak koi adhikaar nahin diya gaya
 The money that comes from house tax stays with the Municipal Corporation and the state government does not give the money that comes from stamp duty to the corporation

 The proposed budget of the corporation is 1600 crores but they get 400 crores
 jab tak ham in sawaalon main dilchaspee nahin lenge gurugram kaa bhala dhara 144 se nahin hoga
 Rathi Ji said that Badshah Pur Nala passes along Sohna Road
 is naale ke zariye hi gurugram kaa pani hero honda chowk se hote hue nazangarh dren main jaataa tha
 a highway was built over this drain and its natural flow was stopped
 nateeja yah hua ki badshaah poor naale kaa pani upar aane laga or waapas usee shahar ko bhar diya
 As a result, Jaipur Highway was blocked first
 chah chah foot pani bhar gaya
 Many vehicles were drowned
 uske baad mahrauli road block ho gaya
 As many sector roads are there, all those blocks of Gurugram went away
 gaadiyaan funsane lageen
 The condition was that the Border Security Force was called at night, yet the road could not open
 rathi sahab ne kaha ki logon kaa gussa vakti he
 You will forget as soon as the road opens
 unhone kaha ki ve pandrah saal se in muddon ko lekar lard rahe hai magar log nahin aate hai
 This anger of the people through rhyme regarding the name tells us how far we have become from the basic questions

 rathi ji ne bataaya ki gudgaanv main 2008 main nagar nigam kii sthapana hui lekin nagar nigam ko 2013 tak koi adhikaar nahin diya gaya
 The money that comes from house tax stays with the Municipal Corporation and the state government does not give the money that comes from stamp duty to the corporation
 kaash ki hamaare paas sarkaar kaa bhi paksh hota lekin rathi ji ke anusaar iskaa nateeja yah hota he ki nagar nigam ke paas vikaas ke liye paise nahin hote hai
 There is no regular staff
 gurugram main 35 ward hai
 There are about 25–30 cleaning workers or corporation employees per ward
 shahar kii zarurat ke hisaab se yah sankhya paryaapt nahin he
 The proposed budget of the corporation is 1600 crores but they get 400 crores
 jab tak ham in sawaalon main dilchaspee nahin lenge gurugram kaa bhala dhara 144 se nahin hoga
 Rathi Ji said that Badshah Pur Nala passes along Sohna Road
 is naale ke zariye hi gurugram kaa pani hero honda chowk se hote hue nazangarh dren main jaataa tha
 a highway was built over this drain and its natural flow was stopped
 nateeja yah hua ki badshaah poor naale kaa pani upar aane laga or waapas usee shahar ko bhar diya
 As a result, Jaipur Highway was blocked first
 chah chah foot pani bhar gaya
 Many vehicles were drowned
 uske baad mahrauli road block ho gaya
 As many sector roads are there, all those blocks of Gurugram went away
 gaadiyaan funsane lageen
 The condition was that the Border Security Force was called at night, yet the road could not open
 rathi sahab ne kaha ki logon kaa gussa vakti he
 You will forget as soon as the road opens
 unhone kaha ki ve pandrah saal se in muddon ko lekar lard rahe hai magar log nahin aate hai
 This anger of the people through rhyme regarding the name tells us how far we have become from the basic questions
 trephic jam ko ham na jane kitne saal se bhugat rahe hai
 People from Delhi Mumbai, Bangalore
 bangaleru vaale to ab barsaat ke pani main machhlee bhi pakadaney lage hai
 The snake also came out
 agar ham jeev jantuon kii zamin ko isi tarah kabja kar smart city basaate rahe to wo ek din nikal kar hamaare paanvon main lipatane aaenge
 The media of TV keeps on telling you stories of fake nationalism every day, but returns to such questions only when you get stuck in a jam
 hamaare shaharon main aise haadase lagaataar hote ja rahe hai
 We are constantly forgetting
 26 july 2005 yani aaj se 11 saal pehle mumbai main kareeb 1000 mimi kii barish hui thi jisamen dub kar sainkadon log mar gaye the
 Many people died in the same car in which they were sitting and going home
 maharashtra sarkaar ne hoicourt main bataaya tha ki barish or uske baad kii beemaari se 1498 logon kii maut ho gai thi
 Last year in Chennai, we all saw terrible devastation
 akele chennai main 269 log mare the
 Among many reasons, some reasons were that the river's land was occupied
 makaan ban gaye
 We often think that the river has dried up but do not see that water can also come from above
 aise vakt main nadi ke vistaar kii zamin par pani failane se baadh jaanaleva nahin ho paati he
 Layers of cement are being laid on the soil and a land of dreams is being formed by taking possession of the pond or the land for expansion of water
 ham media kii ek ajeeb samasya he
 How excited are the floods in the cities because the urban media is now occupied by the people
 unheen shahari logon kaa jinka shahar ke nadi naalon kii zamin par kabja ho gaya he
 Otherwise, a flood has also occurred in a large area of india
 media un khabaron ko bhi dikhaa rahaa he lekin us gusse or uttejnaa kii pratikriya main nahin jiske kaaran gudgaanv ko lekar sab baichaiyn ho gaye
 The comments hamaare sahyogi alok pandey lagaataar is par report file kar rahe hai
 According to their report, 17 lakh people have been displaced by the floods in Assam
 apper assam ke sainkadon gaanv pani main duube hue hai
 People are living in 2000 relief camps
 zarur gudgaanv ke scale se pachaas guna zyada raahat kaary chal rahaa hoga
 The death toll in this severe flood is stated to be 21
 ab aap isi antar ko samajhiye
 Where there is a place to spread the water of the river, the death toll is low even after the severe flood
 mumbai, chennai main saikadon log shahar kii sadak par dub kar mar gaye jise ham gaanv se behatar or surakshit samajhate hai
 Now if we do not understand these questions, then write as much as you wish on Twitter, nothing is to happen
 zaraa apane shahar ke un prakritik ilaakon kaa bhi pataa kiijie jahaan kabhi barsaat kaa pani failata hoga
 What happened to those natural areas? gudgaanv kii traasadee kii kahani kaa raaj trephic jam yaa naale ke over flo hone yaa nigamon ke karmchaariyon kii sankhya kam hone main hi nahin he
 These pictures are also what you are seeing
 jab aap shahar main sirf kaaron ke nikalne kaa rasta banaayenge, pani ke nikalne kaa rasta nahin banaayenge to aisi sthiti kaa saamana karnaa hi padegaa
 a worse situation is going to happen in the coming days
 gudgaanv ke jam ko gurujam kaha ja rahaa he
 We never heard such a disturbance of the word Guru
 pracheen kaal main guru hona kitna acha hota tha, aadhunik kaal main guru kaa matlab ab gurujam ho jayega isaki bhavishyavaanee maine kisi granth main nahin padhi thi
 Gurgaon has received between 40 and 50 mm of rain
 monsoon ke dinon main ye barish bahut bhayankar nahin he
 It is considered common, yet why such a situation happened
 @gauravpandhi Tweet1 Gurgaon to Gurugram! Not just a name, the government wants to take us back to the era of Guru Dronacharya, 5000 years ago

 Gurgaon has many names
 gurugram naam kii ghoshnaa hui he magar notification jari nahin hua he
 The government did not release the notifications but the media started writing Gurugram
 hindustan times ne 21 may 2016 ko ziladhikari tii el satyaprakash kaa bayaan chapa he ki gudgaanv ko gurugram karne kaa koi notification jari nahin hua he
 In the order issued by the District Magistrate on Friday, Gurugram is also not written, but Gurgaon is written
 jabaki gurugram karne kii ghoshnaa 12 april ko hui thi
 When it takes so much time to change the name, understand that it will take two years to build a drain and install a traffic light
 gurugram se pehle logon ne gudgaanv ko pyaar dulaar se bharat kaa singapore kaha, iti city kaha, milinium city kaha
 Now the residents of this place are also mocking these names
 yahaan tak guru dron ke naam par rakhe gaye gurugram ko lekar mazaaq udaaya gaya, maukey kii nazaakat ko dekhte hue aisi baton par aahat hone waalon kii toli bhi ignor karne lagi

 chaahe aap dhara ke saath bahen yaa dhara ke kilaaf bahen, dhara 144 ke bina aap kahin nahin bah sakate hai
 Flood, drought, storm, dharna demonstrations are all Section 144

 That is why Section 144 is used to stop the democratic upsurge, the same happens during natural storms
 dhara brands ke sarso tel kii baat nahin kar rahaa hum
 Gurgaon district magistrate TL Satyaprakash has said that there has been unprecedented rainfall in Gurgaon
 bahut sara pani dilli se gudgaanv main aa rahaa he

 houseing sosayadi ke bheetar kaa dhaancha, sadak se lekar sivej tak builder ke jimme aayaa
 In a way, the responsibility of the government was to build an external road or drain
 rathi sahab ne bataaya ki yahaan ke resident welfare association kii taraf se bahari vikaas ke naam par 17,000 karod rupee huda ko diye gaye hai
 The Gurgaon Citizen Council has also filed a case in the Supreme Court regarding the tax being levied on us and where it is being spent
 2013 main huda ne supreme court main likhit halafanama diya tha ki huda ne metro ko milakar 17000 karod main sirf 5500 karod hi kharch kiye hai
 HUDA has no budget
 jahaan vibhaag ko uchit lagata he vibhaag kharch karata he
 Rathi ji said that the Municipal Corporation was established in Gurgaon in 2008 but the Municipal Corporation was not given any rights till 2013
 house tex se jo paise aate hai wo nagar nigam ke paas rahete hai or stamp duty se jo paise aate hai wo rajya sarkaar nigam ko nahin detii he
 i wish we had the government as well, but according to Rathi ji, the result is that the Municipal Corporation does not have money for development
 regular staff nahin he
 Gurugram has 35 wards
 prati ward kareeb 25-30 safai karmchaaree yaa nigam karmchaaree hai
 This number is not sufficient according to the need of the city
 nigam kaa prastaavik bajet 1600 karod kaa he lekin unhen miltaa 400 karod he
 Unless we are not interested in these questions, Gurugram will not benefit from Section 144
 rathi ji ne kaha ki sohana road ke saath-saath badshaah poor naala guzarataa he
 Through this drain, the water of Gurugram used to pass through Hero Honda Chowk to the Nazafgarh drain
 is dren ke upar haive bana diya gaya or iske swaabhaavik pravaah ko band kar diya gaya
 As a result, the water of Badshah Pur Nala started coming up and filled the same city back
 iskaa nateeja yah hua ki pehle jaipur haive block ho gaya
 Six six feet of water was filled
 kai gaadiyaan dub gayi
 After that Mehrauli Road was blocked
 jitne bhi sector road hai gurugram ke wo saare black hote chale gaye
 Vehicles started getting stuck
 haalat yah ho gai ki raat ko border security force ko bulaayaa gaya, phir bhi sadak khul nahin pai
 Rathi Sahab said that the anger of the people is powerful
 sadak khulte hi bhul jaaenge
 They said that they have been fighting over these issues for fifteen years, but people do not come
 naam ko lekar tukbandi ke zariye logon kaa yah gussa bataata he ki ham buniyadi sawaalon se kitne dur ho gaye hai
 We have been suffering from traffic jams for many years
 dilli mumbai, bangaloru ke log
 The people of Bangalore have now started catching fish in the rainy waters
 saanp bhi nikal aayaa
 If we continue to occupy the land of animals and settle in a smart city, then one day they will come out and come to wrap in our feet
 tivi kaa media kisi farzi rashtrawaad kaa kissa roj sunaakar aapako bhadakaata rahata he lekin aise sawaalon par tabhi lautataa he jab aap kisi jam main funs kar baukhala jate hai
 Such accidents are happening continuously in our cities
 ham lagaataar bhoolatey ja rahe hai
 On July 26, 2005, that is, 11 years ago, Mumbai received about 1000 mm of rain, in which hundreds of people drowned and died
 kai logon kii maut usee car main ho gai thi jisamen baithe baithe ghar ja rahe the
 The Maharashtra government had told the High Court that 1498 people died due to rain and subsequent illness
 pichley saal chennai main bhi ham sabane bhayankar tabaahi dekhi thi
 In Chennai alone, 269 people died
 kai kaarnon main kuch kaaran yah bhi the ki nadi kii zamin par kabja ho gaya
 Houses were built
 ham aksar samajhate hai ki nadi suukh gai he magar yah nahin dekhte ki pani upar se bhi aa saktaa he
 At such a time, flooding is not fatal due to the spread of water on the river's expanding land
 mitti ke upar cement kii paraten bichaai ja rahi hai or talab yaa pani ke vistaar kii zamin ko kabje main lekar sapanom kii sosayadi ban rahi he
 We have a strange media problem
 shaharon main baadh jam ko lekar kitne uttejit ho jate hai kyonki ab ke media par shahari logon kaa hi kabza he
 The same urban people who have occupied the land of the river drains of the city
 varna baadh to hindustan ke ek bade ilaake main bhi ai he
 The media is also showing those news but not in response to the anger and excitement which caused everyone to become restless about Gurgaon
 tippaniyan Our colleague Alok Pandey is continuously filing reports on this
 unki report ke anusaar assam main 17 lakh log baadh se visthapit hue hai
 Hundreds of villages in Upper Assam are submerged
 2000 raahat shiviron main log rah rahe hai
 Surely, relief work is going on fifty times more than the scale of Gurgaon
 is bhayankar baadh main marane waalon kii sankhya 21 bataai gai he
 Now you understand this difference
 jahaan jahaan nadi ke pani ko failane kii jagah he vahaan vahaan bhayankar baadh ke baad bhi marane waalon kii sankhya kam he
 Hundreds of people died in Mumbai, Chennai by drowning on the city road which we think is better and safer than the village
 ab agar ham in sawaalon ko nahin samajhenge to twitor par jitna marzi likh len, hona janaa kuch nahin he
 Just find out the natural areas of your city where the rainy water will sometimes spread
 kya hua un prakritik ilaakon kaa
 The secret of the Gurgaon tragedy lies not in the traffic jams or overflows of the drain or the reduction in the number of employees of the corporations
 in tasveeron main bhi he jo aap dekh rahe hai
 You will have to face such a situation when you will only make a way for cars to leave the city, and do not make a way for water to leave
 aane vaale dinon main isse bhi buree sthiti hone vaali he
 The jam of Gurgaon is being called Gurujam
 guru shabd kii aisi fajihat hamane kabhi nahin suni
 i had not read the prophecy in any scripture about how good it was to be a guru in ancient times, in modern times, Guru would mean Gurujam

 Rathi ji said that the Municipal Corporation was established in Gurgaon in 2008 but the Municipal Corporation was not given any rights till 2013
 house tex se jo paise aate hai wo nagar nigam ke paas rahete hai or stamp duty se jo paise aate hai wo rajya sarkaar nigam ko nahin detii he
 i wish we had the government as well, but according to Rathi ji, the result is that the Municipal Corporation does not have money for development
 regular staff nahin he
 Gurugram has 35 wards
 prati ward kareeb 25-30 safai karmchaaree yaa nigam karmchaaree hai
 This number is not sufficient according to the need of the city
 nigam kaa prastaavik bajet 1600 karod kaa he lekin unhen miltaa 400 karod he
 Unless we are not interested in these questions, Gurugram will not benefit from Section 144
 rathi ji ne kaha ki sohana road ke saath-saath badshaah poor naala guzarataa he
 Through this drain, the water of Gurugram used to pass through Hero Honda Chowk to the Nazafgarh drain
 is dren ke upar haive bana diya gaya or iske swaabhaavik pravaah ko band kar diya gaya
 As a result, the water of Badshah Pur Nala started coming up and filled the same city back

 Six six feet of water was filled

 Such accidents are happening continuously in our cities
 ham lagaataar bhoolatey ja rahe hai
 On July 26, 2005, that is, 11 years ago, Mumbai received about 1000 mm of rain, in which hundreds of people drowned and died
 kai logon kii maut usee car main ho gai thi jisamen baithe baithe ghar ja rahe the
 The Maharashtra government had told the High Court that 1498 people died due to rain and subsequent illness
 pichley saal chennai main bhi ham sabane bhayankar tabaahi dekhi thi
 In Chennai alone, 269 people died
 kai kaarnon main kuch kaaran yah bhi the ki nadi kii zamin par kabja ho gaya
 Houses were built
 ham aksar samajhate hai ki nadi suukh gai he magar yah nahin dekhte ki pani upar se bhi aa saktaa he
 At such a time, flooding is not fatal due to the spread of water on the river's expanding land

 The media is also showing those news but not in response to the anger and excitement which caused everyone to become restless about Gurgaon
 tippaniyan Our colleague Alok Pandey is continuously filing reports on this
 unki report ke anusaar assam main 17 lakh log baadh se visthapit hue hai
 Hundreds of villages in Upper Assam are submerged
 2000 raahat shiviron main log rah rahe hai
 Surely, relief work is going on fifty times more than the scale of Gurgaon

 Now you understand this difference
 jahaan jahaan nadi ke pani ko failane kii jagah he vahaan vahaan bhayankar baadh ke baad bhi marane waalon kii sankhya kam he
 Hundreds of people died in Mumbai, Chennai by drowning on the city road which we think is better and safer than the village
 ab agar ham in sawaalon ko nahin samajhenge to twitor par jitna marzi likh len, hona janaa kuch nahin he
 Just find out the natural areas of your city where the rainy water will sometimes spread
 kya hua un prakritik ilaakon kaa
 The secret of the Gurgaon tragedy lies not in the traffic jams or overflows of the drain or the reduction in the number of employees of the corporations
 in tasveeron main bhi he jo aap dekh rahe hai
 You will have to face such a situation when you will only make a way for cars to leave the city, and do not make a way for water to leave

 @raydeep Tweet6 gurugram ko milinium city kaha jaataa he, lekin aisa lagata he ki ye agali sadi main city ban paaegaa
 Gurugram or Gudgobar
 @mpalso Tweet7 Schools have declared a holiday because of traffic problems
 milinium city gudgaanv main aapkaa swaagat he
 About 35% of Haryana's income comes from Gurgaon
 gudgaanv ke kai naam hai
 The name Gurugram has been announced but the notification has not been issued
 sarkaar ne notification tak jari nahin kiya magar media ne gurugram likhnaa shuru kar diya
 On 21 May 2016, Hindustan Times published a statement by District Magistrate TL Satyaprakash that no notification has been issued to Gurgaon to Gurugram
 shuukravaar ko ziladhikari ne jo aadesh jari kiye hai usamen bhi gurugram nahin likhaa he, balki gudgaanv likhaa he
 Whereas Gurugram was announced on 12 April
 jab naam badalane main itnaa time lag jaataa he to samajhiye naala banane or trephic lite lagane main saal do saal to lagegaa na
 Before Gurugram, people called Gurgaon as the Singapore of India with love, called IT City, called Millennium City
 ab vahaan ke nivasee inhen naamon kaa makhul bhi uda rahe hai
 Even the Gurugram named after Guru Drona was made fun of, in view of the chance of opportunity, the group of those who were hurt on such things started to ignore
 acha hi he
 Anyway people are angry with the condition of the modern city
 puranic kaal main trephic jam thode na hota hoga
 However, there was so much fear from the jam that the administration closed the schools
 or wo dhara 144 laga di jo har dhara ke vakt laga di jaati he
 Whether you flow with the stream or against the stream, without section 144 you cannot flow anywhere
 baadh, sukhadh, tufaan, dharna pradarshan sabamein dhara 144 hi kaam aati he
 The administration has both natural and democratic disasters
 isiilie dhara 144 janatantric ubhaar ko rokane main lagati he vahi prakritik tufaan ke vakt bhi lagati he
 i am not talking about Dhara brand mustard oil
 gudgaanv ke ziladhikari tii el satyaprakash ne kaha he ki gudgaanv main apratyaashit barish hui he
 a lot of water is coming from Delhi to Gurgaon

 The department spends where it deems appropriate
 rathi ji ne bataaya ki gudgaanv main 2008 main nagar nigam kii sthapana hui lekin nagar nigam ko 2013 tak koi adhikaar nahin diya gaya

 baharhaal jam se itnaa khuf fail gaya ki prashasan ne skulon ko band kar diya
 And that section 144 was imposed which is imposed at the time of every stream
 chaahe aap dhara ke saath bahen yaa dhara ke kilaaf bahen, dhara 144 ke bina aap kahin nahin bah sakate hai
 Flood, drought, storm, dharna demonstrations are all Section 144
 prashasan kii nigaah main prakritik or janatantric donon hi aapadaa hai
 That is why Section 144 is used to stop the democratic upsurge, the same happens during natural storms
 dhara brands ke sarso tel kii baat nahin kar rahaa hum
 Gurgaon district magistrate TL Satyaprakash has said that there has been unprecedented rainfall in Gurgaon
 bahut sara pani dilli se gudgaanv main aa rahaa he
 Car engines have failed, jammed in many places for more than 12 hours, in view of the possibility of heavy rains in the next 15 days, i am ordering Section 144
 saare agenciyon ko aadesh diya jaataa he ki ve sahi daron par upkarnon ko kiraaye par lekar shahar main lage jam se mukti ke kaam main jute jaaen
 All contractors must cooperate with the Civic Agency

 The District Magistrate has ordered that the Corporation Commissioner deploy a sufficient number of home guards for the end of September
 inase trephic prabandhan kaa kaam karavaaya jaae
 The expenses incurred on these will be paid by the CEO of Sheetla Mata Temple Board
 gudgaanv kii samasya ko lekar kya ham sahi tareeke se pratikriya vyakt kar rahe hai
 If there are crores of flats there, then the corporation of Gurgaon will also get tax
 new gurugram kii 100 ke kareeb resident welfare association kii ek sheersh sanstha he gudgaanv citigen council
 is
 inke adhyaksh aar es rathi se hamane kuch jaankaree lee he
 Huda is here to build the infrastructure
 haryana deveopment athurity ko huda kehete hai
 Master Road, Master Sewage, Master Drain, Water Supply is made by HUDA
 houseing sosayadi ke bheetar kaa dhaancha, sadak se lekar sivej tak builder ke jimme aayaa
 In a way, the responsibility of the government was to build an external road or drain
 rathi sahab ne bataaya ki yahaan ke resident welfare association kii taraf se bahari vikaas ke naam par 17,000 karod rupee huda ko diye gaye hai
 The Gurgaon Citizen Council has also filed a case in the Supreme Court regarding the tax being levied on us and where it is being spent
 2013 main huda ne supreme court main likhit halafanama diya tha ki huda ne metro ko milakar 17000 karod main sirf 5500 karod hi kharch kiye hai
 HUDA has no budget
 jahaan vibhaag ko uchit lagata he vibhaag kharch karata he
 Rathi ji said that the Municipal Corporation was established in Gurgaon in 2008 but the Municipal Corporation was not given any rights till 2013
 house tex se jo paise aate hai wo nagar nigam ke paas rahete hai or stamp duty se jo paise aate hai wo rajya sarkaar nigam ko nahin detii he
 i wish we had the government as well, but according to Rathi ji, the result is that the Municipal Corporation does not have money for development
 regular staff nahin he
 Gurugram has 35 wards

 This number is not sufficient according to the need of the city
 nigam kaa prastaavik bajet 1600 karod kaa he lekin unhen miltaa 400 karod he
 Unless we are not interested in these questions, Gurugram will not benefit from Section 144
 rathi ji ne kaha ki sohana road ke saath-saath badshaah poor naala guzarataa he
 Through this drain, the water of Gurugram used to pass through Hero Honda Chowk to the Nazafgarh drain
 is dren ke upar haive bana diya gaya or iske swaabhaavik pravaah ko band kar diya gaya
 As a result, the water of Badshah Pur Nala started coming up and filled the same city back
 iskaa nateeja yah hua ki pehle jaipur haive block ho gaya
 Six six feet of water was filled
 kai gaadiyaan dub gayi
 After that Mehrauli Road was blocked
 jitne bhi sector road hai gurugram ke wo saare black hote chale gaye
 Vehicles started getting stuck
 haalat yah ho gai ki raat ko border security force ko bulaayaa gaya, phir bhi sadak khul nahin pai
 Rathi Sahab said that the anger of the people is powerful
 sadak khulte hi bhul jaaenge
 They said that they have been fighting over these issues for fifteen years, but people do not come
 naam ko lekar tukbandi ke zariye logon kaa yah gussa bataata he ki ham buniyadi sawaalon se kitne dur ho gaye hai
 We have been suffering from traffic jams for many years
 dilli mumbai, bangaloru ke log
 The people of Bangalore have now started catching fish in the rainy waters
 saanp bhi nikal aayaa
 If we continue to occupy the land of animals and settle in a smart city, then one day they will come out and come to wrap in our feet
 tivi kaa media kisi farzi rashtrawaad kaa kissa roj sunaakar aapako bhadakaata rahata he lekin aise sawaalon par tabhi lautataa he jab aap kisi jam main funs kar baukhala jate hai
 Such accidents are happening continuously in our cities
 ham lagaataar bhoolatey ja rahe hai
 On July 26, 2005, that is, 11 years ago, Mumbai received about 1000 mm of rain, in which hundreds of people drowned and died
 kai logon kii maut usee car main ho gai thi jisamen baithe baithe ghar ja rahe the
 The Maharashtra government had told the High Court that 1498 people died due to rain and subsequent illness
 pichley saal chennai main bhi ham sabane bhayankar tabaahi dekhi thi
 In Chennai alone, 269 people died
 kai kaarnon main kuch kaaran yah bhi the ki nadi kii zamin par kabja ho gaya
 Houses were built
 ham aksar samajhate hai ki nadi suukh gai he magar yah nahin dekhte ki pani upar se bhi aa saktaa he
 At such a time, flooding is not fatal due to the spread of water on the river's expanding land
 mitti ke upar cement kii paraten bichaai ja rahi hai or talab yaa pani ke vistaar kii zamin ko kabje main lekar sapanom kii sosayadi ban rahi he
 We have a strange media problem
 shaharon main baadh jam ko lekar kitne uttejit ho jate hai kyonki ab ke media par shahari logon kaa hi kabza he
 The same urban people who have occupied the land of the river drains of the city
 varna baadh to hindustan ke ek bade ilaake main bhi ai he
 The media is also showing those news but not in response to the anger and excitement which caused everyone to become restless about Gurgaon
 tippaniyan Our colleague Alok Pandey is continuously filing reports on this
 unki report ke anusaar assam main 17 lakh log baadh se visthapit hue hai
 Hundreds of villages in Upper Assam are submerged
 2000 raahat shiviron main log rah rahe hai
 Surely, relief work is going on fifty times more than the scale of Gurgaon
 is bhayankar baadh main marane waalon kii sankhya 21 bataai gai he
 Now you understand this difference
 jahaan jahaan nadi ke pani ko failane kii jagah he vahaan vahaan bhayankar baadh ke baad bhi marane waalon kii sankhya kam he
 Hundreds of people died in Mumbai, Chennai by drowning on the city road which we think is better and safer than the village
 ab agar ham in sawaalon ko nahin samajhenge to twitor par jitna marzi likh len, hona janaa kuch nahin he
 Just find out the natural areas of your city where the rainy water will sometimes spread
 kya hua un prakritik ilaakon kaa
 The secret of the Gurgaon tragedy lies not in the traffic jams or overflows of the drain or the reduction in the number of employees of the corporations
 in tasveeron main bhi he jo aap dekh rahe hai
 You will have to face such a situation when you will only make a way for cars to leave the city, and do not make a way for water to leave
 aane vaale dinon main isse bhi buree sthiti hone vaali he
 The jam of Gurgaon is being called Gurujam
 guru shabd kii aisi fajihat hamane kabhi nahin suni
 i had not read the prophecy in any scripture about how good it was to be a guru in ancient times, in modern times, Guru would mean Gurujam
 gudgaanv main 40 se 50 mimi ke bich barish hui he
 These rains are not very severe during the monsoon days
 aam hi maani jaati he, phir bhi aisi haalat kyon hui
 The administration has become cautious
 ziladhikari ne aadesh diya he ki sitambar ke ant ke liye nigam ayukta wo paryaapt sankhya main homeguard kii tainaati karen
 They should be made traffic management
 in par jo kharchaa aayega use sheetala mata mandir board ke siio bhugtan karenge
 Are we reacting correctly to the problem of Gurgaon
 agar vahaan karodon ke flats hai to gudgaanv ke nigam ko tex bhi milte honge
 Gurgaon Citizen Council is an apex body of around 100 Resident Welfare Association of New Gurugram
 he
 We have taken some information from its chairman RS Rathi
 yahaan par buniyadi dhaancha banane kaa kaam huda kaa he
 The Haryana Development Authority is called HUDA
 master road, master civej, master drenaj, water supplai banane kaa kaam huda kaa he
 The structure within the housing society, from road to sewage, came to the builder
 ek tarah se sarkaar ke jimme bahari sadak yaa naale vagraih banane ke hi kaam aae
 Rathi Saheb said that Rs 17,000 crore has been given to HUDA in the name of external development by the Resident Welfare Association
 gudgaanv citigen council ne supreme court main ise lekar cese bhi kiya he ki hamaare upar jo tex lage hai wo kahaan kahaan kharch ho rahe hai ye bataaiye
 In 2013, HUDA gave a written affidavit in the Supreme Court that HUDA spent only 5500 crores out of 17000 crores including metro
 huda kaa koi bajet nahin hota he
 The department spends where it deems appropriate
 rathi ji ne bataaya ki gudgaanv main 2008 main nagar nigam kii sthapana hui lekin nagar nigam ko 2013 tak koi adhikaar nahin diya gaya
 The money that comes from house tax stays with the Municipal Corporation and the state government does not give the money that comes from stamp duty to the corporation
 kaash ki hamaare paas sarkaar kaa bhi paksh hota lekin rathi ji ke anusaar iskaa nateeja yah hota he ki nagar nigam ke paas vikaas ke liye paise nahin hote hai
 There is no regular staff
 gurugram main 35 ward hai
 There are about 25–30 cleaning workers or corporation employees per ward
 shahar kii zarurat ke hisaab se yah sankhya paryaapt nahin he
 The proposed budget of the corporation is 1600 crores but they get 400 crores
 jab tak ham in sawaalon main dilchaspee nahin lenge gurugram kaa bhala dhara 144 se nahin hoga
 Rathi Ji said that Badshah Pur Nala passes along Sohna Road
 is naale ke zariye hi gurugram kaa pani hero honda chowk se hote hue nazangarh dren main jaataa tha
 a highway was built over this drain and its natural flow was stopped
 nateeja yah hua ki badshaah poor naale kaa pani upar aane laga or waapas usee shahar ko bhar diya
 As a result, Jaipur Highway was blocked first
 chah chah foot pani bhar gaya
 Many vehicles were drowned
 uske baad mahrauli road block ho gaya
 As many sector roads are there, all those blocks of Gurugram went away
 gaadiyaan funsane lageen
 The condition was that the Border Security Force was called at night, yet the road could not open
 rathi sahab ne kaha ki logon kaa gussa vakti he
 You will forget as soon as the road opens
 unhone kaha ki ve pandrah saal se in muddon ko lekar lard rahe hai magar log nahin aate hai
 This anger of the people through rhyme regarding the name tells us how far we have become from the basic questions
 trephic jam ko ham na jane kitne saal se bhugat rahe hai
 People from Delhi Mumbai, Bangalore
 bangaleru vaale to ab barsaat ke pani main machhlee bhi pakadaney lage hai
 The snake also came out
 agar ham jeev jantuon kii zamin ko isi tarah kabja kar smart city basaate rahe to wo ek din nikal kar hamaare paanvon main lipatane aaenge
 The media of TV keeps on telling you stories of fake nationalism every day, but returns to such questions only when you get stuck in a jam
 hamaare shaharon main aise haadase lagaataar hote ja rahe hai
 We are constantly forgetting
 26 july 2005 yani aaj se 11 saal pehle mumbai main kareeb 1000 mimi kii barish hui thi jisamen dub kar sainkadon log mar gaye the
 Many people died in the same car in which they were sitting and going home
 maharashtra sarkaar ne hoicourt main bataaya tha ki barish or uske baad kii beemaari se 1498 logon kii maut ho gai thi
 Last year in Chennai, we all saw terrible devastation
 akele chennai main 269 log mare the
 Among many reasons, some reasons were that the river's land was occupied
 makaan ban gaye
 We often think that the river has dried up but do not see that water can also come from above
 aise vakt main nadi ke vistaar kii zamin par pani failane se baadh jaanaleva nahin ho paati he
 Layers of cement are being laid on the soil and a land of dreams is being formed by taking possession of the pond or the land for expansion of water
 ham media kii ek ajeeb samasya he
 How excited are the floods in the cities because the urban media is now occupied by the people
 unheen shahari logon kaa jinka shahar ke nadi naalon kii zamin par kabja ho gaya he
 Otherwise, a flood has also occurred in a large area of india
 media un khabaron ko bhi dikhaa rahaa he lekin us gusse or uttejnaa kii pratikriya main nahin jiske kaaran gudgaanv ko lekar sab baichaiyn ho gaye
 The comments hamaare sahyogi alok pandey lagaataar is par report file kar rahe hai
 According to their report, 17 lakh people have been displaced by the floods in Assam
 apper assam ke sainkadon gaanv pani main duube hue hai
 People are living in 2000 relief camps
 zarur gudgaanv ke scale se pachaas guna zyada raahat kaary chal rahaa hoga
 The death toll in this severe flood is stated to be 21
 ab aap isi antar ko samajhiye
 Where there is a place to spread the water of the river, the death toll is low even after the severe flood
 mumbai, chennai main saikadon log shahar kii sadak par dub kar mar gaye jise ham gaanv se behatar or surakshit samajhate hai
 Now if we do not understand these questions, then write as much as you wish on Twitter, nothing is to happen
 zaraa apane shahar ke un prakritik ilaakon kaa bhi pataa kiijie jahaan kabhi barsaat kaa pani failata hoga
 What happened to those natural areas? gudgaanv kii traasadee kii kahani kaa raaj trephic jam yaa naale ke over flo hone yaa nigamon ke karmchaariyon kii sankhya kam hone main hi nahin he
 These pictures are also what you are seeing
 jab aap shahar main sirf kaaron ke nikalne kaa rasta banaayenge, pani ke nikalne kaa rasta nahin banaayenge to aisi sthiti kaa saamana karnaa hi padegaa
 a worse situation is going to happen in the coming days
 gudgaanv ke jam ko gurujam kaha ja rahaa he
 We never heard such a disturbance of the word Guru
 pracheen kaal main guru hona kitna acha hota tha, aadhunik kaal main guru kaa matlab ab gurujam ho jayega isaki bhavishyavaanee maine kisi granth main nahin padhi thi
 Gurgaon has received between 40 and 50 mm of rain
 monsoon ke dinon main ye barish bahut bhayankar nahin he
 It is considered common, yet why such a situation happened
 new gurugram kii 100 ke kareeb resident welfare association kii ek sheersh sanstha he gudgaanv citigen council
 is
 inke adhyaksh aar es rathi se hamane kuch jaankaree lee he
 Huda is here to build the infrastructure
 haryana deveopment athurity ko huda kehete hai
 Master Road, Master Sewage, Master Drain, Water Supply is made by HUDA
 houseing sosayadi ke bheetar kaa dhaancha, sadak se lekar sivej tak builder ke jimme aayaa
 In a way, the responsibility of the government was to build an external road or drain
 rathi sahab ne bataaya ki yahaan ke resident welfare association kii taraf se bahari vikaas ke naam par 17,000 karod rupee huda ko diye gaye hai
 The Gurgaon Citizen Council has also filed a case in the Supreme Court regarding the tax being levied on us and where it is being spent
 2013 main huda ne supreme court main likhit halafanama diya tha ki huda ne metro ko milakar 17000 karod main sirf 5500 karod hi kharch kiye hai
 HUDA has no budget
 jahaan vibhaag ko uchit lagata he vibhaag kharch karata he
 Rathi ji said that the Municipal Corporation was established in Gurgaon in 2008 but the Municipal Corporation was not given any rights till 2013
 house tex se jo paise aate hai wo nagar nigam ke paas rahete hai or stamp duty se jo paise aate hai wo rajya sarkaar nigam ko nahin detii he
 i wish we had the government as well, but according to Rathi ji, the result is that the Municipal Corporation does not have money for development
 regular staff nahin he
 Gurugram has 35 wards
 prati ward kareeb 25-30 safai karmchaaree yaa nigam karmchaaree hai
 This number is not sufficient according to the need of the city
 nigam kaa prastaavik bajet 1600 karod kaa he lekin unhen miltaa 400 karod he
 Unless we are not interested in these questions, Gurugram will not benefit from Section 144
 rathi ji ne kaha ki sohana road ke saath-saath badshaah poor naala guzarataa he
 Through this drain, the water of Gurugram used to pass through Hero Honda Chowk to the Nazafgarh drain
 is dren ke upar haive bana diya gaya or iske swaabhaavik pravaah ko band kar diya gaya

 The dug-up of the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections in 2002 was over
 gorakhpur kii vidhansabha seat se yuva saansad yogi adityanath apane kareebi dow
 Radha Mohan Das Aggarwal had to fight
 yogi kaa maananaa tha ki gorakhpur seat ke siyaasi sameekaran agarwal ke paksh main hai, lihaaja duusare ko tikat milane par jeet mushkil hogi
 However, the BJP gave tickets to Shiv Pratap Shukla, a minister in the BJP government of Kalyan Singh and Rajnath Singh
 shukla chaar baar ke vidhayak to the hi, teen baar cabinet mantri bhi rah chuke the
 Yogi Adityanath was upset with the party for not getting the ticket even after a strong recommendation for his close
 phir unhone daanv chal diya
 The bet was to field Radha Mohan Das Aggarwal against the BJP candidate Shiv Pratap Shukla under the banner of the All India Hindu Mahasabha
 yogi ke janaadhar kaa asar rahaa ki rajya sarkaar main cabinet mantri rahe shiv pratap shukla tisare number par khisak gaye
 While Agrawal won 38830 votes in that election, Shukla finished third with only 14509 votes
 yah ek aisa mauka tha, jab apni maang puri na hone se khafa hokar ek 31 saal ke saansad ne party ko apni takat dikhaa di thi
 He also fought and pitted his candidate against the party's official candidate
 us vakt haare shiv pratap shukla ko baad main 2016 main piem modi ne na keval rajyasabha bheja, balki baad main vitt rajyamantri bhi banaakar siyaasi vanvaas khatm kiya
 Actually, Shiva Pratap Shukla had gone into the background since 2002 defeat
 us haar ne ne unhen upi ke raajnneetik kshitij par is kadar haashiye par daalaa ki unka raajnneeti kariyar hi khatm maan liya gaya tha
 It is said that Yogi's relationship with Shiv Pratap Shukla improved later, he was also in favor of making him a minister in the Modi government

 iske baad se sanyas dhaaran karne ke baad ajay singh bisht yogi adityanath ho gaye
 Since Gorakhnath Math was closely associated with parliamentary politics
 lihaaja math ke mahant ke saath yogi rajaneta bhi ban gaye
 Talking about the history of Gorakhnath Math's involvement in parliamentary politics, in 1967, Mahant Digvijaynath of the Math became a Member of Parliament of Gorakhpur on the ticket of Hindu Mahasabha
 vahiin unke uttaradhikari mahant avaidhyanath 1962, 1967, 1974 va 1977 se maniram vidhansabha seat se lagaataar vidhayak chune gaye
 Avaidyanath became MP for the first time in 1970, then he also won in 1989, 1991 and 1996
 iske baad avaidhyanath ne yogi adityanath ko apana raajnneetik uttaradhikari ghoshit karte hue maatr 26 saal kii umr main bijepi se tikat dilaakar chunaav maidan main utaar diya
 He became the youngest MP of 12th Lok Sabha by winning Lok Sabha elections from Gorakhpur in 1998

 After this, the BJP got a bumper success in the 2017 UP Assembly elections, then in March 2017, the party made the Chief Minister
