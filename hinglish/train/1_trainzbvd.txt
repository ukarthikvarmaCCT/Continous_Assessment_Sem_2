 In such a situation, the question arises that despite the recommendations of the Samvat Commission formed during the time of the Congress Government, the Congress did not take any action on Anna then
 or agar anna kaa aacharan saamvat cameti kii siforeeshon ke baavjood tab sarkaar ke liye galat nahin tha to ab wo itnaa galat kyon ho gaya he
 On the beach of Rameswaram, little Kalam was told by his teacher about the manner of flight of birds and aircraft, which not only made his life a goal but also made it easier for him to understand the mysteries of physics

 APJ is known as Abdul Kalam, who is no longer among us
 dow
 APJ Abdul Kalam passed away on Monday evening after falling while delivering a lecture at IIM
 kalam ke jivan se judi aisi hi kai baaten ek nai kitaab 'ri-ignited : scientific pathauez tu e brieter future' main hai
 The book, written by Kalam and his former scientific advisor, Sreejan Pal Singh, also advises young people to pursue careers in fields such as robotics, aeronautics, neurosciences, pathology, palaeontology and material sciences
 kalam kaa kahana tha ki jab vah yuva the, tab unhen payalat, unke vimaanon kii kahaniyaan acchhee lagati thim
 He was always keen to learn about planes and wanted to become a pilot himself
 unhone likhaa 'mere gaanv main to ginechune log hi vimaanon par charchaa kar sakate the
 My family members were not educated, but i benefited greatly from my teachers
 meri jigyaasa ek shikshak ne shant kii
 Then i was 10 years old and in fifth grade
 isse mere jivan kii disha hi badal gai
 Kalam wrote in this book, 'my teacher's name was Shivasubramanian Iyer
 ek din 65 chaatro kii kaksha main unhone blikeboard par chitra bana kar bataaya ki pakshi kaise udate hai
 The same day he took us to the beach of Rameswaram where seabirds were flying
 ' In this book published by Penguin Books, former President Kalam wrote, 'our teacher explained how birds spread their wings, change direction using their wings and tail and what is the force behind the flight
 
 
 yah pakshi ke jivan kii urja
 ' unke anusaar, shikshak ne bataaya ki vimaan isi siddhant ke aadhaar par udata he
 After an hour of this lesson, Kalam understood the secret of the bird's flight
 kalam ne kaha ki ek lacture ne unki jindagi kii disha badal di
 He said 'my teacher gave me the purpose of life
 mujhe bhautik vigyaan ke adhyayan kaa mahatv samaj main aa gaya
 i chose physics
 maine aronatical ejineering ko praathamikta di or phir rocket ejeeniyar bana
 After that the space scientist
 ' In the book, he also told how much he liked to read newspapers filled with pictures of fighter planes and stories of World War II in his childhood
 paanchavi kaksha main padhate samay kalam ne akhbaar baantne ke taur par pehla rojgaar shuru kiya tha
 The comments unke bade bhai unhen apni cycle dete the
 From five o'clock in the morning, Kalam used to take bundles of Tamil newspapers and distribute them to local offices, some tea stalls and sometimes houses
 unhone likhaa ki lekin stesan se ravaanaa hone se pehle main vahaan bench par baith kar dainik 'dinamani' kii ek prati kholta tha
 The first page was always good, with pictures of fighter jets and World War II stories

 apije abdul kalam kaa nidhan kaa somvaar shaam im main ek vyaakhyaan dene ke dauraan girane ke baad nidhan ho gaya
 Many such things related to Kalam's life are in a new book 're-ignited: Scientific Pathways to a Brighter Future'

 Kalam said that when he was young, he liked the stories of the pilot, his planes
 vimaanon ke bare main jaanane ke liye vah hameshaa utsuk rahete the or vah khud payalat bananaa chaahate the
 He wrote, 'in my village, only a few people could discuss planes

 america chatramishol crosska ek post internet par khub viral hua tha, jisamen unhone aapbeetee likhi thi
 He wrote about how people used to stare at him during a study in India, chased him and even tried to rape him
 or in sab kii vajah se vah persenality dysorder kaa shikaar ho gayi
 Read Michelle Cross's blog Now another foreign girl Jane has written about her experience in India
 neeli ankhon vaali is german ladki kaa kahana he ki bharat main uskaa anubhav mishael cross se bilkul alag rahaa
 Jane's experience is her own: i have read many times about Michelle Cross's Indian experience
 jin lakhon logon ne yah blog padaa he, main unase alag nahin hum
 But the difference is that i too have gone through that dreadful experience like a cross because i keep going to India alone
 or haa, main bhi white hum, main apane 20wein baras main hum or ek videshi mahila hum
 i have traveled to many areas of India alone and have been living in Delhi for the last two months
 meraa anubhav kaaphi sakaaratmak or romaanchak he or main mere prati bharatiyon ke aatithy se kaaphi abhibhoot hum
 Why is India different for me? Am i really just lucky Or do i look at India from a different perspective in my desire to behave differently for myself? i am here comparing my experience with Michelle's experience so that i can explain what i want to say
 kya bhartiya purush mujhe ghoorte hai? haa, ve aisa karte hai
 
 
 And so do Indian women and children and European travelers
 ve mujhe usee kautuhal se dekhte hai jaise africa, dakshin america, purvi or dakshini europe or duusare asian deshon kii yatraaon ke dauraan vahaan ke log mujhe dekhte the
 i think it is only natural to see someone from abroad
 main apni eritrean (africa mahadweep kaa sudur purv desh eritrea) dost ko uttari germany sthit apni daadi ke gaanv le gai thi
 Foreigners come to the area with little to no
 vahaan har koi use ghur-ghurkar dekhtaa tha
 "ciao Bella" when the Italian men stare at me! Used to say italy ke maacho culture main flert ke is tareeke kaa swaagat kiya jaataa he
 In India, it is seen as sexual abuse
 italy ke purush agar ghuren to vah tarif or bhartiya purush ghuren to vah paap
 Why so? (let me tell you that when you meet someone for the first time in Italy and they say hi or bye in a friendly way, it is called Ciao
 vahiin, kisi mahila ko dekhakar Bella kehane kaa matlab he khubasurat
 ) Do people take my pictures? Yes, they do
 
 
 lekin main unki or bhi zyada tasviren khinchati hum! ham pashchimi log zyaadaatar bina ijaajat liye bharat ke har smarak, jagah or logon kii tasviren lete hai
 We also post these pictures on our Facebook page and travel blog
 lekin agar koi bhartiya kisi europea kii photo letaa he to ham chidh jate hai or hamen lagata he ki hamaari niztaa main dakhal diya ja rahaa he
 Are double standards not being adopted here again? White skin privilege is a punishment for brown skinned people? Am i a center of attraction in social events? Yes, i am
 yah bharatiyon ke aatithy kaa hi nateeja he ki mujhe paanch shaadiyon or kai tyoharon main shaamil hone kaa mauka mila
 When i used to dance, a lot of people wanted to dance with me and many people took photos and videos of me
 main un samarohon main akeli white mahila thi or bahut saare logon ne kabhi kisi white mahila ko bollywood gaanon main thirakate hue nahin dekha tha
 In my case, the attention i received in Indian celebrations was no different from the reception and curiosity i received during a wedding reception in Kosovo
 kya bhartiya purushon ke saath meraa koi nakaaratmak anubhav he? haa, sabase kharaab anubhav tab hua jab landan se aate vakt air india kii ek flite main ek bijnesaman ne meri jaangh ko chuaa
 But my positive experiences are more than negative
 mujhe sirf saamaan bechney vaale logon se nipatna padataa tha jo mujhe chhodte nahin the
 Many Indians invited me to their homes and poorest families fed me
 mujhe hotalon main bahut kam hi rahanaa padaa kyonki bhartiya mujhe unke ghar main rahane ko kehete the or ve mere liye apni patni ke kagin yaa dost ke ghar main rahane kaa intjaam bhi karte the
 On many occasions, the owners of the dhabas and the sellers of fruits did not take money from me saying that i am a guest of India
 kya koi mere bhartiya anubhav kaa andaja laga saktaa he? nahin, koi nahin

 There are many Indians in India
 sabhi musafir bahut kam bharatiyon se baatcheet karte hai or isliye ve bhartiya anubhav ke bare main bahut kam hi bataa sakate hai

 i usually adapt myself according to the situation, i have less doubt and i trust more
 jaise abhi haal hi main main apni ek angrej dost ke saath kasauli gai thi
 We wore kurtis and bangles and during this time we chatted and joked with many people including chaiwala, pandit and other Indian tourists
 mere dost ke dost ne hamase kasauli dekhne kaa aagrah kiya or hamen gaanv main aamantrit kiya
 We ate delicious dal, vegetables and rice at dinner with his family
 hamane unke parivaar kii photo elbum bhi dekhi
 i think that every traveler's experience would be exciting and 'real' if he adopted a friendly attitude towards Indians
 main yah suzav nahin de rahi hum ki bharat mahilaon ke liye swarg he
 You do not need to listen to disappointing incidents like molestation, sexual exploitation and female feticide every day
 haalanki bharat main meraa anubhav or mere prati bharatiyon kaa ravaiya bahut hi sakaaratmak rahaa he
 Many of my friends have had a similar experience
 main ummid karti hum ki mishael ke saath hue bartaav ke bajaae bharat duusare videshi musafiron ke saath bhi vaisaa hi bartaav karegaa jaisaa meraa saath kiya gaya
 Soon i will go to London for my studies
 mujhe apni jindagi bina khaas dekh-rekh ke bitaani hogi, jahaan chaiwaalon ke ghar kaa khaanaa nahin hoga, chaat paapadi nahin hogi, bollywood ke gaanon par dance nahin hoga or naa puja hi hogi
 i refuse to adjust there in Shayal and come back to India next year

 iske liye vah ek kadam aage janaa chaahati he

 In this novel by senior narrator Shubha Verma, the internal movements of a voluntary organization like Kritika, the mutual pull of the members associated with the organization and the rage-hatred arising out of personal jealousy and the disguised creative campaign of a few writers, versus personal ambitions

 The crackdown on Team Anna, which has launched a campaign against corruption, has once again started appearing
 team ke ek mahatvapurn sadsy ne arvind kejariwal ko patr likhakar unase andolan kii aguai ke tareeke par tikhe sawaal kiye hai
 Team Anna member Shivendra Singh Chauhan has written this letter
 pichley hafte hi unhone team ke pramukh sadsy prashanth bhushan ke awaas par unase mulaakaat ke dauraan fasebuk par maujuud ‘india against karpshan’ ke prishth ke prabandhan par charchaa kii thi
 Significantly, Arvind Kejriwal has alleged that Chauhan does not believe in democracy and has taken unilateral decisions in the context of social media campaign
 kejariwal ne yah chetavanee bhi di ki agar chouhaan kor samiti ke faislon ko nahin maanate, to unhen andolan se ‘hataaya’ bhi ja saktaa he
 In his letter, Chauhan wrote, 'unless you prove that you are the leader of this movement and i have ever acted against the interests of the movement, by what authority will you separate me or accuse me The i am sure that keeping disagreements and working independently for the interests of the movement also cannot be harmful to the movement
 ’is sandarbh main kejariwal kii pratikriya jaanane ke liye unhen bheje gaye sandesh kaa koi jawaab nahin mila he
 Chauhan wrote in his letter, 'this is a people's movement against corruption and most of us joined it on our own free will and not through any formal process
 isliye kisi samooh kii ore se nikaale jane kaa sawaal hi paidaa nahin hota
 This is the movement of all of us and no one can have a monopoly in the fight against corruption
 ’unhone yah bhi likhaa ki kor samiti ke sadsy loktantric tareeke se nahin chune gaye
 He also said that in January this year, Kejriwale had offered to include him in the committee, but he said that he did not need it
 chouhaan ne sawaal uthaaya ‘meraa sawaal yah he ki kis loktantric prakriya ke tahat mujhe kor samiti main shaamil karne kii peshkash kii gai thi
 He said that the democratic method would have been one in which a method like electing members of the Jan Lokpal would have been adopted to elect the core committee members
 prashanth bhushan ke awaas par hui baithak main chouhaan ne un aaropon kaa bhi khandan kiya ki anna hajaare se sambandhit jaankaree fasebuk ke panne par nahin daali gai

 There have been allegations of EVM disturbances once again in UP body elections
 saharanpur main nirdaleey mahila pratyaashee ko ek bhi vot nahin mila
 On the result, the candidate questioned the EVM and said that how is it possible that i did not even get my vote
 kam se kam mere or mere parivaar ko vot to milanaa tha
 evms have been questioned many times before
 saharanpur ke ward number 54 se parshad pratyaashee shabana ko counting main pataa chalaa ki unhen booth number 387 or 388 par ek bhi vot nahin mila he
 Shabana questioned the credibility of evms
 unhone kaha ki kam se kam meraa or mere parivaar kaa to vot mujhe mila hi he
 How can it be possible that i did not even get my vote
 unhone kaha ki hamen ummid thi ki kam se kam 900 vot hamen milegaa, lekin aisa nahin hua
 He alleged that there was a disturbance in the EVM when i did not get a single vote at the booth
 isse pehlevoatingke dauraan bhi iviem main gadabadi kii shikaayatein ai thim
 In Kanpur, people created a ruckus over the voting machine disturbances
 ward number 66 par iviem main kharabi kii shikaayat ke baad votaron ne jamkar bavaal kiya tha
 Police had to resort to lathi-charge to overcome the angry mob in Pashupatinagar area of naubasta
 media reports ke mutabik, kanpur ke chakeri kshetra ke ward sankhya 58 main voting karne pahunche matadaataaon ne jamkar hangaamaa kaata tha
 Votron's allegation was that the vote is going to BJP by pressing the button of any party in EVM
 meerut main bhi hangaamakanpur kii tarah hi meerut main bhi iviem main gadabadi kii shikaayat kii gai thi
 In Ward 85 of Zakir Colony here, the EVM of booth number 243 went bad, following which the gathering of people created tension in the atmosphere
 yahaan bhi logon ne kisi bhi batan dabaane par ek hi party ko vot jane kaa daawa kiya tha
 The real question has been lost in the uproar in Parliament after the CAG report on coal allocation
 ve koun-si companiyaan hai, kinaki companiyaan hai or kin−kin netaaon ke hit unase jude hai, jinhen koyale ke ye block mili
 The NDTV team thoroughly investigated this and found that all political parties had black hands in the coal deal
 dilli ke ajmeri get ke paas banaai gai pushp steel and mining naam kii is company ne kaaphi kam samay main bada safar tay kiya
 The company was registered in 2004, with a capital of just one lakh rupees
 usee din isane chhattisgarh main louh ayask kii khan ke liye arji di
 The state government leased him
 aktubar 2006 main chhattisgarh hoicourt main iske kilaaf ek cese bhi hua, lekin 2007 main ise madhya pradesh main 55 million ton koyale ke block aavantit kar die gaye
 The Congress alleges that Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Raman Singh is behind this company
 yah baat chhattisgarh congress ke pravaktaa shailesh nath trivedi ne kahi
 Raman Singh denies this allegation
 ulte is company ke paksh main motilal vora kii ek chitthee milti he
 This letter of July 2007 states, 'if this lease is granted, it will create employment opportunities and industrial development in the fort of Chhattisgarh, the backward areas of Kanker will also progress
 isse sarkari khazaane ko bhi faaydaa hoga
 Therefore, i request that priority should be given to finalizing this lease, on which the state government has given its recommendation long back
 ' The matter reached the Delhi High Court, which expressed surprise over the lease of Pushp Steel
 hycourt ne kaha, ' ye acolpaneey he ki kaise aisi company ko piel (leez) dene ke bare main sochaa ja saktaa he, jab tay paimaane bataate hai ki aavedak ko pehle se kuch anubhav hona chahie
 How a company can apply like this in Chhattisgarh within a few hours of its formation in Delhi
 ' Now the question is, who was the power behind this company, the Chhattisgarh government or the Congress leaders
 company is maamle main sirf ye bataa rahi he ki chhattisgarh main wo plant shuru karne vaali he
 There are other companies that can be questioned on getting coal blocks
 in companiyon main prakaash industries bhi ek he
 Prakash Industries was allotted a 34 million tonne coal block in 2003 in Chhattisgarh
 ye koyala khule bazaar main nikaalane ke aarope ke baad sibiai ne yahaan chaape maare
 The owner of this company is Ved Prakash Aggarwal who is the brother of Jai Prakash Aggarwal
 jaiprakash agarwal ke bijepi or aresas se link hai
 Jayaprakash Aggarwal heads the Naturopathy Wing of BJP
 haalanki is maamle main prakaash industries ne kaha he, 'surya liting ke jaiprakash agarwal or bijepi kii nachuropathy cell kaa prakaash industries se koi lenaa-dena nahin he or unke bhai se koi kaarobaari sambandh nahin hai
 There is no question that the company extracted additional coal to sell in the market
 company sibiai ke saath puraa sahyog kar rahi he
 ' sawaal uthta he kya prakaash industries ko phayda pahunchaaya gaya
 The company received a large allocation of coal, claiming capacity expansion, but no expansion of the company was shown
 2006−08 main atirikt koyala utpaadan shuru kiya gaya or 2006−08 main teen atirikt koyala block die gaye
 Did Prakash Ind extract additional coal? According to the complaint, 'prakash extracted nine lakh tonnes of coal in the first nine months
 agle saal 10 lakh ton koyala nikaala
 Of these, only four to five lakh tons were used
 phir baaki koyala kahaan gaya? Now talk of SKS Ispat and Power Limited
 is company ke liye sidhe kendriya mantri subodhakant sahay ne pradhanmantri ko chitthee likhi
 On 5 February 2008, Union Minister Subodh Kant Sahai wrote a letter to the Prime Minister
 unhone kaha ki pradhanmantri escees ko do block dilaane ke liye sidhe dakhal den
 The Prime Minister's Office sent the letter to the Ministry of Coal

 Now the third company is mentioned
 ye green inphra naam kii company he jo chayan ke paimaanon par khari nahin utari phir bhi ise koyala diya gaya
 Here also it is clear that the leaders have the strength behind it
 is baar congress−bijepi se baahar telugu desham ke taar dikh rahe hai
 In 2008, a company named Green Infra was allocated 990 million tonnes of coal in the Fatehpur East coal block to set up a power plant in Chhattisgarh
 jabaki 2008 main yah un nau companiyon se ek thi jise is bina par kaarij kar diya gaya tha ki yah chayan ke paimaanon par puure nahin utari
 In his petition, Green's office has been given 201 golf apartments in Delhi's Sujan Singh Park, but the house is in the name of former Telugu Desam MP and businessman MVVS Murthy
 ab murti green inphra ke saath kisi bhi sambandh se inkaar karte hai
 It is learned that the name of this company has been changed to Athena Infra Projects
 ab iskaa daftar bhikaaji kama place main he
 Now Alok, the head of this company, is not ready to speak anything on this issue

 The government is surrounded by coal allocation and the BJP is attacking the attack
 mangalvaar raat sushamaa swaraj ne kaha ki is daur main koyala khadaanon ke hue aavanton radd hon
 The coal minister, speaking to NDTV India, directly rejected the demand
 sarkaar kii jaani−pahachaani safai rahi he ki saare aavanton kaa faisla screening cametiyon ke jariye hua he jisamen rajya sarkaron ke bhi numaayinde rahe hai

 ye company 2004 main register hui, sirf ek lakh rupee kii puunji ke saath
 The same day it applied for an iron ore mine in Chhattisgarh

 Was not competitive bidding for coal due to former Minister of State for Coal Dasari Narayan Rao? Dasari served as the Minister of State for Coal from 2004 to 2008 and handled the work of allocation
 sibiai us daur ke dastavezon kii jaanch kar rahi he
 Because the CAG report states that on 16 July 2004, Coal Secretary PC Parekh wrote to Dasari Narayan Rao that private companies are benefiting from this allocation
 nilaamee se iskaa kuch hissaa sarkaar ke paas aa saktaa he
 In another note sent on 30 July, the coal secretary said that the current method of allocation cannot be transparent
 20 agast ko koyala mantralay ne kaha ki cabinet main bhejne ke liye ek draft note taiyaar kiya jaae
 On September 11, a note came out from the Prime Minister's Office, stating some deficiencies in the allocation through auction
 25 sitambar ko koyala sachiv ne jawaab diya ki in etraazon main koi dam nahin he
 Finally, on October 4, the Minister of State wrote that the auction path could not be considered any more because it would delay it further
 tippaniyan The CBI is also looking at how the companies which got coal blocks sold it further? Whereas in the market, the mines which were priced at Rs
 2000 were received by these companies at Rs
 100 per tonne
 sibiai ke mutabik sabase zyada gadabadi purvi pattee main hui− khaaskar jharkhand or chhattisgarh ke ilaakon main
 The CBI investigation begins where the CAG report ends
 sieji kah rahi he kol block dene kii niti se nuksaan hua jabaki sibiai yah dekh rahi he ki is niti ke tahat bhi jo license die gaye unamem gadabadi hui he
 Apparently, ministers and officials of state governments may also be implicated in this
 ab sawaal he ki is company ke peeche kiski takat thi chhattisgarh sarkaar kii yaa congress netaaon kii
 In this case, the company is only stating that it is going to start a plant in Chhattisgarh
 aisi companiyaan or bhi hai jinhen koyala block milane par sawaal uthaae ja sakate hai
 Prakash Industries is also one of these companies
 prakaash industries ko 2003 main chhattisgarh main 34 million ton kaa kol block aavantit kiya gaya
 The CBI raided here after allegations of extracting these coal in the open market
 is company ke maalik veda prakaash agarwal hai jo jai prakaash agarwal ke bhai hai
 Jayaprakash Agarwal has links with BJP and RSS
 jaiprakash agarwal bijepi kii nachuropathy wing ke pramukh hai
 However, in this case, Prakash Industries has said, "jayaprakash Aggarwal of Surya Lighting and Naturopathy Cell of BJP has nothing to do with Prakash Industries and has no business relationship with his brother
 is baat kaa sawaal hi nahin uthta ki company ne bazaar main bechney ke liye atirikt koyala nikaala
 The company is fully cooperating with CBI
 ' The question arises whether Prakash Industries was benefited
 company ne kshamta vistaar kaa daawa karte hue baari maatra main koyala aavanton hasil kiya, lekin company kaa koi vistaar dikhaaya nahin gaya
 Additional coal production was started in 2006–08 and three additional coal blocks were awarded in 2006–08
 kya prakaash industries ne atirikt koyala nikaala? shikaayat ke mutabik, 'pehle nau maheenon main prakaash ne nau lakh ton koyala nikaala
 The next year extracted 1 million tons of coal
 inamen se sirf chaar se paanch lakh ton kaa istemaal hua
 Then where did the rest of the coal go? ab baat escees ispaat or power limited kii
 For this company, Union Minister Subodh Kant Sahai wrote a letter to the Prime Minister
 5 farvari 2008 ko kendriya mantri subodhakant sahay ne pradhanmantri ko chitthee likhi
 He said that the Prime Minister should directly intervene to get SKS two blocks
 pradhanmantri karyaalay ne chitthee koyala mantralay ko bhej di
 a day later, the Ministry of Coal allocated 73 million tonnes of coal block in Chhattisgarh Fatehpur block
 prakaash industries iske khilaaf adaalat chali gai
 It claimed that Subodh Kant Sahai's brother Sudhirkant Sahai represented the company in the screening committee
 ab teesri company kaa zikr
 It is a company called Green Infra, which did not meet the criteria of selection, yet it was given coal
 yahaan bhi saaf dikhaai padataa he ki iske peeche netaaon kii takat he
 This time the Telugu Desam stars are seen outside the congress-bjp
 2008 main green inphra naam kii company ko chhattisgarh main power plant lagane ke liye fatehpur east kol block main nau karod 90 lakh ton koyale kaa aavanton kiya gaya
 Whereas in 2008, it was one of the nine companies that were rejected without knowing that it did not meet the selection criteria
 apni arzi main green ke daftar kaa pataa dilli ke sujan singh park main 201 golf apartment diya hua he, lekin ye makaan telugu desham ke purv saansad or kaarobaari emvivies murti ke naam he
 Now Murthy denies any association with Green Infra
 pataa yah chalaa he ki is company kaa naam badalakar athena inphra projects rakh diya gaya he
 Now its office is in Bhikaji Cama Place
 ab is company ke pramukh alok is mudde par kuch bhi bolne ko taiyaar nahin hai
 He says that he does not know how this company is registered at the home address of the TDP MP
 jab enditivi ne company kii website se jaankaree dhundhani chaahi tab pataa chalaa ki ye company 2003 main bani or iske promotor the karvi financiel services ke sansthaapak−nideshak emes ramakrishna
 His website mentions dozens of projects from Andhra to Arunachal Pradesh and Chhattisgarh
 kya athena ke taar jaganmohan reddy se bhi jude hai? athena ke ek bade afasar ne tasdiq kii he ki 2006 se lekar 2009 tak company ke nideshkon main ek matrix laboratories ke nimmagarhda prasad the jo jaganmohan reddy ke kareebi bataae ja rahe hai
 Whether it is the registered office at the TDP leader's house or the Jaganmohan Reddy corruption case, it is surprising how coal was allocated despite this
 bataa den ki bijepi ne mangalvaar ko maang kii thi ki vivaad main pade koyala aavanton radd kiye jaaen
 On Tuesday, Coal Minister Sriprakash Jaiswal rejected it directly
 koyala aavanton ko lekar sarkaar ghiri he or bijepi hamale par hamale kar rahi he
 Sushma Swaraj said on Tuesday night that the allocation of coal mines should be canceled during this period
 koyala mantri ne enditivi india se baat karte hue ye maang sidhe khaarij kar di
 It has been a well-known explanation of the government that all the allocation has been decided through screening committees in which state governments have also been represented
 bijepi ab ise bhi dikhaava bataa rahi he
 BJP spokesman Prakash Javedkar said that the screening committee was misused
 ye ek mukhauta tha, kol block aavanton ke liye
 
 
 All eyes are now on the companies that have got these licenses
 aglaa sawaal yahi he kya license baantne ke maamle main alag−alag netaaon or dalon ke khilaaf saboot mil rahe hai
 Coal officials are coming to investigate and dispute from officer to minister

 Apparently, ministers and officials of state governments may also be implicated in this
 in companiyon main prakaash industries bhi ek he
 Prakash Industries was allotted a 34 million tonne coal block in 2003 in Chhattisgarh
 ye koyala khule bazaar main nikaalane ke aarope ke baad sibiai ne yahaan chaape maare
 The owner of this company is Ved Prakash Aggarwal who is the brother of Jai Prakash Aggarwal
 jaiprakash agarwal ke bijepi or aresas se link hai
 Jayaprakash Aggarwal heads the Naturopathy Wing of BJP
 haalanki is maamle main prakaash industries ne kaha he, 'surya liting ke jaiprakash agarwal or bijepi kii nachuropathy cell kaa prakaash industries se koi lenaa-dena nahin he or unke bhai se koi kaarobaari sambandh nahin hai
 There is no question that the company extracted additional coal to sell in the market
 company sibiai ke saath puraa sahyog kar rahi he
 ' sawaal uthta he kya prakaash industries ko phayda pahunchaaya gaya
 The company received a large allocation of coal, claiming capacity expansion, but no expansion of the company was shown
 2006−08 main atirikt koyala utpaadan shuru kiya gaya or 2006−08 main teen atirikt koyala block die gaye
 Did Prakash Ind extract additional coal? According to the complaint, 'prakash extracted nine lakh tonnes of coal in the first nine months
 agle saal 10 lakh ton koyala nikaala
 Of these, only four to five lakh tons were used
 phir baaki koyala kahaan gaya? Now talk of SKS Ispat and Power Limited
 is company ke liye sidhe kendriya mantri subodhakant sahay ne pradhanmantri ko chitthee likhi
 On 5 February 2008, Union Minister Subodh Kant Sahai wrote a letter to the Prime Minister
 unhone kaha ki pradhanmantri escees ko do block dilaane ke liye sidhe dakhal den
 The Prime Minister's Office sent the letter to the Ministry of Coal
 ek din baad koyala mantralay ne chhattisgarh fatehpur block main 73 million ton kol block use aavantit kar diya
 Prakash Industries went to court against this
 isamen daawa kiya ki subodhakant sahay ke bhai sudhirkant sahay ne screening kamity main company kii numaaindgi kii
 Now the third company is mentioned
 ye green inphra naam kii company he jo chayan ke paimaanon par khari nahin utari phir bhi ise koyala diya gaya
 Here also it is clear that the leaders have the strength behind it
 is baar congress−bijepi se baahar telugu desham ke taar dikh rahe hai
 In 2008, a company named Green Infra was allocated 990 million tonnes of coal in the Fatehpur East coal block to set up a power plant in Chhattisgarh
 jabaki 2008 main yah un nau companiyon se ek thi jise is bina par kaarij kar diya gaya tha ki yah chayan ke paimaanon par puure nahin utari
 In his petition, Green's office has been given 201 golf apartments in Delhi's Sujan Singh Park, but the house is in the name of former Telugu Desam MP and businessman MVVS Murthy
 ab murti green inphra ke saath kisi bhi sambandh se inkaar karte hai
 It is learned that the name of this company has been changed to Athena Infra Projects
 ab iskaa daftar bhikaaji kama place main he
 Now Alok, the head of this company, is not ready to speak anything on this issue
 unka yah kahana he ki unhen nahin maaloom ki aakhir yah company tidipi ke saansad ke ghar ke pate par kaise panjikrut he
 When NDTV sought to find information from the company's website, it was revealed that the company was formed in 2003 and its promoter was MS Ramakrishna, founder-director of Karvy Financial Services
 uski website par andhra se lekar arunachal pradesh or chhattisgarh tak darjanon pariyojnaon kaa zikr he
 Are Athena's wires also linked to Jaganmohan Reddy? a senior Athena official confirmed that Nimmagadda Prasad of Matrix Laboratories was one of the directors of the company from 2006 to 2009, who is said to be close to Jaganmohan Reddy
 tidipi ke netaa ke ghar par registerd daftar ho yaa jaganmohan reddy bhrashtachar maamle se sambandh, tajjub he ki iske baavjood ise koyale kaa aavanton kaise kar diya gaya
 Explain that the BJP had demanded on Tuesday that the coal allocation in the dispute be canceled
 mangalvaar ko koyala mantri shriprakash jaiswal ne ise sidhe kaarij kar diya
 The government is surrounded by coal allocation and the BJP is attacking the attack
 mangalvaar raat sushamaa swaraj ne kaha ki is daur main koyala khadaanon ke hue aavanton radd hon
 The coal minister, speaking to NDTV India, directly rejected the demand
 sarkaar kii jaani−pahachaani safai rahi he ki saare aavanton kaa faisla screening cametiyon ke jariye hua he jisamen rajya sarkaron ke bhi numaayinde rahe hai
 The BJP is now showing it as a show
 bijepi pravaktaa prakaash javedkar ne kaha ki screening cameti kaa durupyog kiya gaya
 It was a mask for allocation of coal blocks
 
 
 ab sabaki nazar un companiyon par he jinhen ye license mili hai
 The next question is whether evidence is being found against different leaders and parties in the matter of distribution of licenses
 koyala aavanton vivaad kii jaanch or aanch main afasar se lekar mantri tak aa rahe hai
 The CBI says that although no names were mentioned in the initial FIR, some officers and ministers are also under the scanner
 kya purv koyala rajya mantri dasari narayan raav kii vajah se koyale kii compititive biding nahin ho pai? dasari 2004 se 2008 tak koyala rajyamantri rahe or aavanton kaa kaam dekhte rahe
 The CBI is investigating the documents of that period
 kyonki sieji report bataati he ki 16 july 2004 ko koyala sachiv pisi paarekh ne dasari narayan raav ko likhaa ki is aavanton se nijee companiyon ko bahut faaydaa ho rahaa he
 Some part of it can come to the government through auction
 30 july ko bheje ek or note main koyala sachiv ne kaha ki aavanton kaa maujuuda tareeqa paardarshee nahin ho saktaa
 On 20 August, the Coal Ministry asked that a draft note be prepared for sending to the cabinet
 11 sitambar ko pradhanmantri karyaalay se ek note chalaa jisamen nilaamee ke jariye aavanton kii kuch kamiyaan bataai gayi
 On 25 September, the coal secretary replied that there would be no merit in these objections
 akhirkaar 4 aktubar ko rajyamantri ne likhaa ki nilaamee ke raste par ab or vichaar nahin ho saktaa kyonki isse or deree hogi
 The comments sibiai ye bhi dekh rahi he ki jin companiyon ko koyale ke block mili unhone ise aage kaise bech diya? jabaki bazaar main jin khadaanon kii qeemat 2000 rupee thi ve in companiyon ko 100 rupee ton ke hisaab se milin
 According to the CBI, the most disturbance occurred in the eastern belt - especially in the areas of Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh
 sieji report jahaan khatm hoti he sibiai kii jaanch vahaan shuru hoti he
 The CAG is saying that the policy of giving coal blocks has caused a loss, while the CBI is seeing that the licenses given under this policy have also gone wrong
 jaahir he isamen rajya sarkaron ke mantri−afasar bhi funs sakate hai
 However, in this case, Prakash Industries has said, "jayaprakash Aggarwal of Surya Lighting and Naturopathy Cell of BJP has nothing to do with Prakash Industries and has no business relationship with his brother

 On Tuesday, Coal Minister Sriprakash Jaiswal rejected it directly
 koyala aavanton ko lekar sarkaar ghiri he or bijepi hamale par hamale kar rahi he
 Sushma Swaraj said on Tuesday night that the allocation of coal mines should be canceled during this period

 In place of Janardan Dwivedi, he was given the important responsibility of organization general secretary, but Gehlot's supporters were disappointed that Gehlot got a place in the central organization in Delhi in 2019, but now he is away from the chair of Rajasthan CM went
 is mudde par congress mukhyalay memshok gahalotane do took kaha ki media main kuch bhramit karne vaali khabaren ain hai

 i have been overwhelmed by the love of the people of Rajasthan for 40 years
 vaise bhi dilli rajasthan se dur nahin hum, isliye rajasthan ko lekar bhram nahin failaayaa jaae
 In Rajasthan, even though Rahul Gandhi has not announced to declare anyone as the CM candidate, but after getting the responsibility of Gujarat in-charge, then General Secretary of the organization, speculations were made that this cleared the way for Sachin Pilotka
 in sab khabaron ko bhraamak bataate hue khud ashok gahalot ne bataaya ki rahul gandhi ne kaha he ki har rajya main netaa ekajute hokar kaam karen
 Without naming Sachin Pilot, Gehlot said that the line of seniors and juniors has been drawn
 unhone kaha ki juniurs ko chahie ki wo seniors dwaara pehle se khinchi lambii lakeer se badi lakeer khinchen
 This will benefit the party as well as them
 lekin pehle se khinchi line kaatane kii koshish hogi to party ko bhi nuksaan hoga or khud unka bhi
 Overall, Ashok Gehlot has given a direct message to his supporters as well as the political corridors that he wants to remain in the race for the seat of CM and will not back down at any cost

 eent, kancreet or sariyon ke saikadon ton malbe ke neeche se aisi kisi awaz kaa sunai dena bhi apane-aap main kisi karishme se kam nahin
 So, people start chasing that innocent voice without delay
 ye awaz kabhi tej hoti he or kabhi bilkul band ho jaati he
 But the question here is of a life, so people do not delay and dig
 sachai to ye he ki upar se dekh kar sahi-sahi andaaza lagaana bhi behad mushkil he ki wo bacchee malbe ke dher main thik kis jagah par ho sakati he
 But then the effort continues
 ek saath kai jode haath ret or mitti ke saath-saath kancreet ke baari-bharkam tukdon ko hataane lagate hai
 Then there is another charisma after exactly one minute and forty seconds
 pehali baar malbe ke neeche ek bacchee ke nanhen-nanhen haath-paanv nazar aate hai
 The child is on the left side and is so caught up in the dust and mud that it is difficult for her to breathe even if she is moving
 lekin ye shaayad uuparavaale kii hi marzi he ki itane mushkil halaat main fansi hone ke baavjood uske rone kii awaz malbe se baahar logon ko sunai de rahi thi
 Now the digging becomes more rapid and then upon seeing it, the whole body of the child starts appearing
 lekin is haal main use tezi se baahar khinchnaa bhi use or zakhmi kar saktaa he
 So, first a rescue worker puts a hand in his mouth and takes out the mud, so that he can breathe freely
 phir pehle dhire se uske paanv azaad kiye jate hai
 Then the entire baby girl is taken absolutely safe
 haalankimalabemein fansi bacchee ke aankh, naak, munh, kaan har jagah dhul hi dhul bhar chukaa he
 Relief workers lift him out of the rubble
 isi ke saath bacchee kii jaan bachaane kii khushi main log uuparavaale kaa shukriya adaa karne lagate hai
 This operation is completed in a few minutes

 Indian cricket team captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni has admitted that his team's morale has dropped after five consecutive defeats on foreign soil but his teammates will be able to make a comeback in this four-match series through the Sydney Test
 dhoni mahasoos karte hai ki melbern test match main mili 122 ranon kii haar ke baad bhartiya team ko nakaarna samay se pehle liya gaya faisla sabit ho saktaa he
 Speaking to reporters at the Sydney Cricket Ground, Dhoni said that you are thinking of saying India has been paid in this series but it can be wrong to say that given the stature of our players
 hamane hameshaa vaapasi kii he or austrailian team ko is shrinkhalaa main hamaare gendbaajon or ballebaajon se nipatane ke liye acchhee-khaasi mehnat kerani hogi
 It is a different matter that we did not play well in the first Test match but it does not mean that we cannot play well in Australia
 dhoni ne kaha ki videshi dharti par lagaataar paanch haar ne unke saathiyon ke aatmavishvaas ko hilaayaa he lekin yah bhi sach he ki unke saathiyon ne har haar se sabak lee he
 Dhoni said that constant defeat affects thinking but it does not affect our level because we know why all this is happening eventually
 ham galatiyon se sikhte hai or hameshaa sakaaratmak sochate hai
 We have learned a lot of positives from the past defeats
 supreme court uphaar cinema agnikand maamle main purv ipies adhikari amod kanth kii yachika par sunwaayee karegaa
 In 2013, the Supreme Court stayed the proceedings against Kanth in the lower court
 kanth kii yachika par sibiai se bhi jawaab talab kiya gaya tha
 Amod Kanth has challenged the order of the Patiala House court to summon him in 2010 in the matter of allowing additional seats in the gift cinema
 1997 main hue is agnikand main 59 darshakon kii mrityu ho gai thi
 The comments isse pehle, aamod kanth ne dilli hai court kaa darwaja khatkhataya tha
 On not getting relief, he filed a petition in the apex court
 kanth kii ore se nyaayalay main kaha gaya tha ki hai court ne is tathy par gaur nahin kiya ki sibiai unke khilaaf kaarywahi ke liye sweekruti lene main vifal rahi he
 On 12 August 2010, Amod Kanth was summoned by the trial court on the request of the victims of the fire
 hai court ne purv ipies adhikari ke is tark ko asweekaar kar diya tha ki uphaar cinema main atirikt siten lagane kii anumati dene ke maamle main unke khilaaf mukadmaa nahin chalaaya ja saktaa kyonki jaanch agency ne iske liye manjuuri hasil nahin lee he
 The High Court said that if they raise this question in the lower court, then this issue can be considered there
 hai court ne kanth kii is daleel ko bhi thukraa diya tha ki unhen clin chit dene vaali sibiai kii maamla band karne kii report asweekaar karke nichali adaalat ne galati kii he

 Earlier, Amod Kanth had approached the Delhi High Court
 raahat nahin milane par unhone sheersh adaalat main yachika daayar kii
 On behalf of Kanth, it was stated in the court that the High Court did not take into account the fact that the CBI had failed to get approval for proceedings against him
 agnikand ke peediton ke anurodh par hi nichali adaalat ne 12 agast 2010 ko amod kanth ko samman jari kiya tha

 kejariwal se milane ke baad dilli congress ke kaaryakari adhyaksh haaron yusuf ne kaha, 'hamane mukhyamantri ko kaha he ki jis tarah se fiks charge badaye gaye or unke mantri kehete hai ki yah fiks charge ham log waapas isliye nahin le paa rahe the kyonki chunaav aachaar samhita lagi hui thi
 My question to the Aam Aadmi Party government is that if the code of conduct was in place then it was only for some time while the fix charge is being charged for the last 1 year
 ' haaron yusuf ke mutabik agar sarkaar unki baat nahin maanegi to congress sadakon par utarkar pradarshan karegi
 While the Aam Aadmi Party's Delhi government claims that cheaper power is already being given in Delhi than the Congress government
 dilli kii urja mantri satyendra jain ne daawa kiya ki aaj agar congress ke shasankaal main jis tarah se bijli ke daam bad rahe the vaise hi badhate rahete to bijli 5 guna tak mahangi hoti
 According to Satyendar Jain 'let's understand as an example that when the Sheila Dixit was in government in 2010, the 50 unit bill with 1 KW load was Rs 153, which increased to Rs 264 in 2013 whereas today it is reduced to Rs 128 in 2019
 done
 isi tarah se 2010 main 2 KW lod ke saath 400 unit bijli kaa bill 1368 rupye tha, 2013 main yah badhkar 2243 hua or aaj 2019 main ye 1320 rupee par aa gaya he
 According to Satyendar Jain, 91% of consumers in Delhi at this time are those whose bills are less than 400 units every month
 bijli bill wo mudda he jisapar arvind kejariwal ne 2012 main apni raajnneeti kii shuruyaat kii thi
 It is worth noting that in 2013, when Arvind Kejriwal went on a hunger strike on the issue of electricity bill, the Aam Aadmi Party leaders and workers filled a form from the people of Delhi stating that the increased electricity bill is wrong or either the Delhi government electricity Make it cheaper otherwise they will not pay electricity bills
 aam aadmi party ke varisht netaa manish sisodiya jab aise lakhon form bharva kar tatkaaleen mukhyamantri shila dikshit ke ghar pahunche the to shila dikshit unase nahin mili thim
 According to Manish Sisodia, he was told that Chief Minister Sheila Dixit was sleeping
 jabaki aaj dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal hai or purv mukhyamantri shila dikshit unase bijli bill ghataane kii maang kar rahi hai

 In the Aarushi murder case, the Supreme Court has shocked the Talwar couple and the Uttar Pradesh government

 In fact, the Supreme Court has approved the cbi's petition for hearing and tagged it with the petition of Hemraj's wife

 The Allahabad High Court gave the verdict after the CBI did not present any strong evidence to prove that the Talwars were killed in the killings of Aarushi and Hemraj
 hoicourt ne saath hi sibiai jaanch kii khaamiyon kii ore bhi ingit kiya tha
 Under the Standard Operational Procedure, the agency has to file an appeal in the upper court within 90 days after receiving a copy of the lower court's order
 sibiai se jude sutron ke mutabik sibiai ke sheersh adhikariyon ko abhi ye tay karnaa baaki he ki hoicourt ke aadesh ke khilaaf apil daakhil kii jaae yaa nahin
 Sources said that legal experts are of the opinion that the CBI should file an appeal in the Supreme Court

 But one day later the police also found Hemraj's body from the roof of the house
 noida police ne vaardaat ke baad die bayaan main talwaar dampati par shaq jataate hue kaha tha ki aarushi or hemraj ko ‘aapattijanak avasthaa’ main dekhne ke baad rajesh ne donon kii hatya kar di
 Later this case was transferred from Noida Police to CBI
 noida police kii is baat ke liye bhi aalochana hui thi ki usne jaanch ko sahi dhang se anjaam nahin diya tha jisaki vajah se ahm forensik sabooton ko nahin jutaya ja sakaa tha
 The CBI after its investigation had filed a closure report in the case
 sibiai kaa kahana tha ki talwaar dampati ko hatyaon ke liye doshi sabit karne laayak sabooton kaa abhaav he
 However, the CBI special court in Ghaziabad rejected the agency's argument
 is adaalat ne talwaar dampati ko aarushi or hemraj kii hatya kaa doshi maanate hue donon ko umr kaid sunai thi

 Rajasthan 
 tamaam raajnneetik dal chunaav se pehle prachaar-prasar main jor-shor se jute gaye hai
 The ruling BJP is leaving no stone unturned to woo voters
 isi kadi main aaj pradhanmantri narendra modi rajasthan pahunche hai
 He addressed the Vijay Sankalp Sabha at Kaymer in Ajmer
 - piem ne kaha ki rajasthan main is baar parampara badalegi
 The storm of victory has come
 vijay nishchit he
 - People living on the confidence of the suppressed also give the budget to such people who do the work of development or not
 The report is made on paper, the money is stolen, the country is ruined because of it
 - piem modi ne kaha,congressi to bajet aavanton main bhi isi prakaar kaa khel karte hai or baad main jahaan unka vot bank sulabh ho unako bajet dete to hai lekin baad main apni raajnneeti ko bachaae rakhane ke liye dabang logon ke bete or bhattije ko theka dete hai
 - PM said- Do Rajasthan have any expectation from the Congress or is there any expectation from the family worshipers, or will the family revolts do you good, will they take time out to do good for the family? -hamaara haikaman rajasthan kii saade saat karod kii janata he
 His high command is a family, now would you say that he should work for seven and a half crores or for the family? - piem ne kaha ki kuch logon ko desh kii pragati main vishwaas nahin he
 There is a worry about keeping our politics going
 hamaari disha sahi he, niti spasht he or niyat par koi shaq nahin kar saktaa he
 There is no shortage of hard work because the countrymen are our family
 - hamane kisaanon ke liye jo vaada kiya tha, wo puraa kiya
 Congress is worried about this
 unhen to jhooth jeene kii takat detaa he
 - PM said- Our soldiers have the ability to sour the enemy's teeth
 congress is par bhi raajnneeti karne lagi
 Shame on such politics and thinking
 - piem ne kaha-koi bahut aage nikal jaae, koi bhubhag bahut peeche rah jaae yah bhi hamen manjuur nahin he
 The mentality of the people who do vote bank politics is this, where there is a chance, make pieces, where there is a chance, create a rift, where you get an opportunity, put each other in front and they will keep fighting and hug one and straighten their owl
 -jo vot bank kii raajnneeti karte hai unako kabhi hindu-muslim kaa khel karne main majaa aata he
 Sometimes it is fun to play next-previous games
 kabhi jati-birdari kii raajnneeti karne main majaa aata he
 - The PM said, the game of vote bank politics on the one hand is the development of all
 is nai raajnneeti kaa daayitv donon main jameen aasmaan kaa antar hota he
 - PM said that the Congress performs the aarti of a family, does a parikrama
 yahi unki raajnneeti he
 What will the family worshipers do for the public? badi mushkil se desh ne disha pakadi he
 Now they do not have to give a chance under any circumstances
 - piem ne kaha ki vot bank kii raajnneeti karne waalon ko desh ke kisi kone main mat ghusane dijiye
 We earnestly strive to uphold the principles of governance
 - vot bank kii raajnneeti puri vyavastha ko tabah kar detii he
 If such people sit in the government, they divide everyone in the vote bank
 unhen hi pad dete hai
 In this case, half the bureaucracy gets away from government work
 - piem ne kahadesh or duniya ke liye main bhale hi pradhanmantri hum lekin bhaajapa ke liye main kaaryakarta hum
 As an activist, whenever the party, whoever gives me the responsibility, i try to fulfill it wholeheartedly
 - janata ke bich apane kaary kaa hisaab dene se bhaajapa kabhi munh nahin chhipaati he

 com / vngw7fy9rf — SRIDEVI BONEY KAPOOR (@sridevibkapoor) February 28, 2018 Two days after Sridevi's final ceremony she wrote an emotional letter about her mother
 jahnavi ne is letters main kaha- 'maine or khushi ne apni maa khoi he or papa ne apni jaan
 'on my birthday, the only thing i ask of all of you is that you love your parents
 Cherish them and devote yourself to making them feel that love
 They have made you
 And i ask that you remember my mother fondly, pray for her soul to rest in peace
 Let the love and adulation you'll showered on her continue and please know that the biggest part of my mother was the love she shared with papa
 And their love is immortal because there was nothing like it in the whole world
 Nothing as joyful and pure and no two people as devoted to one another as they were
 Please respect that because it hurts to think anyone would ever try to tarnish it
 Preserving the sanctity of what they had would mean the world not only to my mother but also to a man who's entire being revolved around her, and her two children who are all that remains of their love
 Me and Khushi have lost our mother but papa has lost his “jaan”
 She was so much more than just an actor or a mother or a wife
 She was the ultimate and the best in all these roles
 It mattered a great deal to her to give love and to get love
 For people to be good and gracious and kind
 She didn't understand frustration or malice or jealousy
 So let’s be that
 Let's be full of only good and give only love
 That would make her happy, to know that even in death, she gave you all something
 The courage and inspiration to fill yourselves with nothing but love and rid yourselves of bitterness in any way and form
 That’s what she stood for
 Dignity, strength and innocence
 Thank you for the love and support everyone has shown us in the past couple of days
 It's given us hope and strength and we can't thank you all enough

 com / us4nv3blm1 Delhi Police has busted gangs by cloning atms and cheating people
 ye wo gang he jo logon kii mehnat kii kamai ko palak jhapakate hi gaayab kar detaa tha or logon ko jab tak bhanak lagati unka bank account khaali ho chukaa ho jaataa he
 Within the last one month, the police registered a complaint of about 88 people having their accounts empty
 iske baad police ne maamle kii jaanch shuru kii
 During investigation, the police found out that all those people who complained had withdrawn money from 2 atms in Tilak Nagar area
 iske baad police ne donon atm ke sisitivi nikaale, is jaanch main ek sandigdh kii pahchaan hui or police ne ise turant giraftaar kar liya he
 Its name is Dharmendra Saini and he hails from Najafgarh, Delhi
 police ke mutabik, dharmendra saini hi gang kaa mastermind he
 After interrogation, his three partners Siddharth, Sunil Kumar and Mayank Saxena have also been arrested
 in par aarope he ki in logon ne 2 atm se ek hafte ke andar 88 logon ke atm ke card copy kar unase paise nikaal liye
 These people used to select such atms where guards are not deployed to cheat, then the accused Mayank Shukla first reached and sprayed the CCTV cameras installed in the ATM
 phir ye log atm card lagane vaali jagah par skimming mashin laga dete the
 After this, as soon as someone installed his ATM card, his entire data was copied
 iske baad ye log laptop ke jariye plane card ko chloning ke jariye nayaa atm card taiyaar kar lete the
 The police have seized 300 plane ATM cards, cloning machines and all these items of cheating from them
 inke paas se 16 lakh cash bhi mili
 Surprisingly, these people had purchased a skimming machine and plane card from a large online shopping website
 pashchimi dilli kii disipi monica bharadwaj ne bataaya ki jab public atm se paise nikaalane ke liye jaati he to jahaan card lagaate hai, vahaan agar jarurat se zyada kuch baahar niklaa hua he to us par ghayan den or police ko jaanakri den
 He told that now the police is also going to write that online shopping website not to sell similar items
 VIDEO : ayog ke gathan par raajnneeti The country's cities have been hit by air pollution since Diwali
 is gambhir samasya se nipatane ke liye punjabi singer jasbir jassi ne logon ko sandesh diya
 Jasbir said that Diwali is a festival full of love and harmony
 ise saaf, sundar or svachh banaae rakhane ke liye hamen aage aana padegaa
 Jassi believes that the environmental level is continuously increasing due to the fireworks on the occasion of Diwali
 is samasya se bachane ke liye hamen aage aakar apana yogadan dena chahie
 On Diwali, we should illuminate this festival with lamps instead of firecrackers so that this festival of light will be saved from getting mixed with the poison of air pollution
 jassi ne aage kaha ki dharm guruon ko chahie ki vah apane shishyon ko vaayu pradooshan ke bare main jaagruk karen
 At the same time, people should also change their ways of celebrating their festivals because if there are leftovers, then religion will remain
 upi ke unnav jile ke dondia kheda riyasat ke jis kile main bhartiya puraatatv surveykshan vibhaag khajaane kii khoj ke liye khudaai kar rahaa he wo khajaana raja raav rambakhsh singh kaa nahin balki unke purvaj maharaj trilok chand kaa he
 The reason for this is that Raja Rao Rambakhsh ruled here for only eight years
 darasal yah khajaana solahavin shatabdi main yahaan raaj karne vaale maharaj trilok chand ne jutaya tha
 It may be in the mound located behind the treasury temple, where once Rambakhsh's father Babu Bansat Singh used to sit
 saath hi ye khajaana kile kii diwaron main bhi ho saktaa hai
 There is also a map of this treasure, which was left by King Rambaksh to his mother
 rambaksh kii maa fatehpur riyasat kii thim
 All these claims belong to Professor Lal Amarendra Singh, son of Zamindar Visheshwar Singh of Dondikheda State, who now lives in Lucknow
 amarendra singh ke pita visheshwar singh ne 1924 main lakhanu ke king george medical kalege se embibies kii degree lee thi or vahiin dondiakheda main doctori kii practice karte the
 He was made a zamindar by Rambaksh
 dondia kheda riyasat or yahaan ke aakhri raja ravarambaksh singh kaa itihaasis riyasat kaa itihaas shuru hota hai saal 1194 main, jab qutubuddhin aibak ne kannauj ke raja jayachand singh par hamalaa kiya tha
 Jaichand's commander Keshav Rai was killed in that attack
 keshav raay ke do bete the, abhaya chand or nirbhay chand
 After the Kannauj war, these two brothers went to their maternal grandfather Punjab
 1215 main ye donon bhai waapas unnav aae
 Then there was the kingdom of Argal
 us dauraan pathaanon ne argal par hamalaa kiya
 Both brothers saved the queen of Argal kingdom and her daughter from this attack
 lekin is ladaai main nirbhay chand maare gayi
 Soon after this, in 1215, Argal Maharaj married his daughter to Abhay Chand and gave Abhay Chand the area of the Ganges
 isse pehle dondia kheda main jise sangrampur ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa hai, yahaan par bhar jati ke log rajya karte the
 Sethu Rai, grandson of Abhay Chand, won the fort of Bharon and established his kingdom here
 ise baisavaara rajya ke naam se bhi jaanate hai
 It is mentioned in the book 'chronicles of Unnao' by the English collector Elliot, who used to be the collector of Kanpur in 1881
 baad main abhaya chand ke vanshaj maharaja trilok chand yahaan ke pratapi raja hue, jinhen is ilaake main vaishyon kaa sabase pratapi raja kaha jaataa tha
 Trilok Chand was associated with Bahlol Lodi, the emperor of the Delhi Sultanate
 inke alaava mainpuri ke raja sumer shah chouhan bhi behalol lodi se jude huye the
 Apart from Unnao, Trilok Chand's kingdom extended to Bahraich, Barabanki, Lakhimpur Kheri and Kannauj
 aisa mana jaataa he ki yah bada khajaana trilok chand kaa hi he
 King Ravrambaksh was the last king of this princely state, who ruled only eight years
 1857 kii gadar ke baad raja ramrao baksh banaras bhaag gayi
 During this time the British attacked Daundia Kheda Fort twice
 ek baar june 1857 main or duusari baar nanvabar 1858 main
 In this attack, the fort was destroyed by cannons
 haalanki angrej khajaane ko nahin paa sake
 Rambaksh had two queens and had no children from both of them
 badi rani kalakankar thi or choti rani nikin
 After the mutiny, both of them went there and both died there
 raja rambaksh banaras bhaag gayi or sanyasi kaa rup dhaaran kar liya
 The British made two parts of this princely state
 pehla hissaa mararmau ke raja digvijay singh ko diya or doosraa hissaa moraavaan ko, joki dondia kheda ke khajaanji hua karte the
 Then Kanpur Cantt used to be a cantonment of the British and it is believed that the Khatris supplied logistic supplies to the British
 inhone bhi baad main raja ravraam baksh ke bare main angrejon ko soochna di thi
 In October 1859, Raja Rao Rambaksh was captured and on 28 December 1859, the British hanged him near Buxar, where the government later built a park
 kile ke paas jo mandir he use raja rambaksh ne hi banwaaya tha
 But the establishment of the shikhara of the temple and the idol installation was done in 1932 by the zamindar Visheshwar Singh
 ram baksh kii maa fatehpur jile ke ajampur kii thim
 Even here, Baba Sobhan Sarkar has claimed that a part of the treasure is buried there too
 mana jaataa he ki rambaksh ne khajaane kaa vivaran apni maa ko bataaya tha
 According to Professor Lal Amarendra Singh, excavation has already been done to find the treasure, which was done by King Shivprasad Singh of Muraramau
 professor amarendra singh kaa kahana he ki khajaane kaa ek bada hissaa mandir ke peeche maujuud tile main ho saktaa he
 Because there used to be a meeting of Basant Singh, the father of Raja Rambaksh
 unhone kaha ki bhartiya puraatatv surveykshan ke log khudaai ke liye aadhunik takanic kaa istemaal nahin kar rahe hai, jisamen ek satellite ke ddhara jameen ke andar chupe metal kaa pataa lagaaya jaataa he
 The second technique is the jigger counter, through which hidden metal is detected inside the ground

 Delhi's politics has created a ruckus following the assault on Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's residence with Chief Secretary Anshu Prakash
 aap ke vidhayak giraftaar kiye ja rahe hai to sattarudh party kii ore se centre par lagaataar hamalaa kiya ja rahaa he ki dilli sarkaar ko giraane kii sajeesh rachi ja rahi he
 During the uproar at Kejriwal's house on Monday night, former MLA Sanjeev Jha, who was present there, gave information about the entire incident from his eyes
 unhone kaha, 'rashan ke masale par charchaa shuru hui thi, lekin baatcheet sunne kii bajaae chif secretary ne kaha ki vah aapke liye jimmedaar nahi hai
 After this a heated debate ensued and he left citing LG
 ' unke aane se pehle sabhividhayakaram se baithkar baat kar rahe the
 All the mlas were already in the room
 sanjeev jha ne bataaya ki yah baithak drawing room main hui thi, or vahaan shaayad sisitivi camera bhi nahin laga hua he
 He claims that legislators also folded their hands in front of the Chief Secretary in view of the growing dispute from both sides
 aap party ke purv vidhayakaza ne bataaya ki mukhya sachiv ke get se andar aane or baahar jane main mahaj 5 minute kaa antar he
 He says that there was a debate on the issue of advertising and then how can all this happen in just 3 minutes
 unhone bataaya ki party ke purv vidhayak nitin tyaagi get tak unase maafee maangane bhi aae lekin marpet jaisaa kuch bhi nahin tha
 He said that if the chief secretary was assaulted, he should have undergone medical examination on the same night
 unhone kaha, 'mukhya sachiv usee raat medical kar sakate the
 i do not know how his medical treatment was done
 'purv vidhayak ne kaha ki dilli ke mukhya sachiv mem kutti ke rahete samay aisi sthiti nahin ai thi
 We also used to talk to Kutti Saheb
 agar wo kaam karte to ladaai kyon hoti
 We do not do settings with them
 mukhya sachiv kaam nahi kar rahe hai, aise main agar vidhayak shikaayat karte hai to unhen sunanaa chahie
 After the fight with the Chief Secretary, the IAS Association protested fiercely and demanded an apology from the government
 unhone is par kaha ki iees association ek raajnneetik manch he
 BJP has a conspiracy behind this and is trying to stop the government

 He claimed that the AIADMK would strongly assert its rights in Delhi by winning 40 seats in the Lok Sabha elections
 tippaniyan Addressing the party meeting, Jayalalithaa said that both the BJP and the Congress were 'united' and 'committed' to not give its share of water to Tamilanadu from the river Kaveri
 unhone kaha, ‘‘kaveri ko lekar tamilnadu ke adhikaar ko sunishchit karne ke liye hamen loksabhaa chunaan main akele ladanaa hoga or ham tamilnadu kii sabhi 39 evam pudducheri kii ekmaatr seat ko hasil karenge
 '' unhone daawa kiya ki annadramuk loksabhaa chunaav main 40 siton par jeet hasil karke dilli main apane adhikaron ko lekar majbootee se jor degi
 The comments jayalalita ne party kii baithak ko sambodhit karte hue kaha ki bhaajapa or congress donon isko lekar ‘ekajute’ or ‘patibaddh’ he ki kaveri nadi se tamilanadu ko uske hisse kaa pani nahin diya jaae
 He said, "to ensure Tamil Nadu's authority over Kaveri, we have to fight alone in Lok Sabha Chunan and we will win all 39 seats in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry's only seat
 ’’ Addressing the party meeting, Jayalalithaa said that both the BJP and the Congress were 'united' and 'committed' to not give its share of water to Tamilanadu from the river Kaveri

 com / rfoi8cvfi4— ANI (@ani)june 29, 2019haal hi main bharat kii ore se ye bayaan aayaa tha ki pakistan ne kartarpur coridor ko lekar bharat ke prastaavon ko maanane se manaa kar diya he, saath hi is par pakistan ne kuch niyam or sharten bhi lagaai thi
 Pakistan refused to accept almost all of India's proposals regarding this
 in maangon ko pakistan ne maanane se kiya tha inkaar1
 India had said that 5000 pilgrims should visit Kartarpur Sahib every day and on a particular day like Baisakhi, Gurupurnima, 15,000 pilgrims should visit every day, but Pakistan denied it in the meeting
 usne kaha he ki rojaanaa sirf 500 shraddhalu darshan karenge, jo sankhya bharat ke hisaab se bahut kam he
 2
 bharat ne maang kii tha ki sabhi bhartiya naagarik or OCI card dharak kartarpur sahib ke darshan karne jaaen par pakistan ne kaha ki keval sikh hi vahaan par darshan karne jaaenge
 3
 bharat ne pakistan se kaha ki ek parivaar yaa phir ek group chaahe jitani sankhya kaa ho usko kartarpur ke darshan karne ke liye pakistan ijaajat de, lekin pakistan ne yahaan bhi bharat kii baat nahin maani or usne kaha ki keval or keval 15 shraddhaluon kaa group hi ek baar me bharat se darshan karne ja saktaa he
 India had objected to this
 4
 India said that whether a person goes by car or he wants to go on foot to visit, he can go, it should be according to his wish, but Pakistan, while running its own arbitrary here, said that someone walking across the border to see Can not go darshan karne vaala shraddhalu sirf or sirf gaadi se hi ja saktaa he
 5
 kartarpur sahib ko maharaja ranjit singh ne or kuch shraddhaluon ne milakar 100 acre jameen daan main di thi
 Pakistan is using this land for itself
 bharat ne kaha kii 100 acre jameen kartarpur sahib trust main rakhaa jaae
 Pakistan also denied this during its meeting

 But following the recommendations of the Lodha Committee, the scene is about to change
 northeast banegaa gemchengerub tak northeast kaa bhartiya cricket main bahut hi halkaa role rahaa he lekin ab uske paas paanch nae sadsy ho jaaenge- nagaland, mizoram, manipur, meghalaya or arunachal pradesh
 These states will play an important role in bcci's power sharing, but very little cricket is played in these areas
 yani ab prashasnic gatividhiyon ke liye alag alag dhade inhen apane paksh main karne ke liye lubhaane kii koshishen karenge
 Also, the governments of these states can also play an important role in this
 70 se adhik umr waalon par roklodha samiti ke siforeeshon ke tahat umr kii seemaa or pad par bane rahane kii samyavadhi ke lagu hone ke saath hi desh ke 30 cricket associationon main bade padon par asin logon ko hatana padaa
 Since the Supreme Court's decision to implement the recommendations of the Lodha Committee, structural changes have started to take place on a large scale in the functioning of the board
 pehle kisi bhi adhikari kii umr or shashan kii avadhi nirdhaarit nahin hoti thi lekin ab yah tay kar di gai he
 BCCI has banned the age of over 70 years
 isi kaaran sharad pavaar, niranjan shah, en shrinivasana, aies bindra, empi pandov, karnataka cricket pramukh ashok anand or assam cricket ke sachiv arshivaad behaara ke liye aage kaa rasta band ho gaya
 The biggest name of these is Sharad Pawar, who was the President of BCCI while holding the post of Union Minister of Agriculture and for a long time his politics continued to have an impact on cricket
 anuraag thakur kaa kaarykaal 22 may 2016 se 2 janvari 2017 tak mahaj 225 dinon kaa rahaa
 There will be a three-year term, people involved in politics have not been banned but there is no place for ministers and government officials
 ab keval teen saal kaa kaarykaal hoga jabaki agle teen saal niskriy avadhi ke rup main bitaane padenge
 No officer will remain attached to the bcci's power for more than 9 years
 teen saal ke kaarykaal ke baad jo agali teen saal kii avadhi hogi use nae adhikariyon ko taiyaar karne main bada role adaa karegi
 How will the selection committee be? It will also have an impact on the selection of the team
 ab tak prayek jone se ek or kul paanch selectors hote rahe hai
 But it is not possible for these five people to monitor the cricket of the whole country
 agar chayan samiti main paanch se adhik log honge to gharelu cricket kii gatividhiyon par inaki paini najar bani rahegi
 As a result, we will get more and more talent to come forward
 jone kaa pratinidhitiv kar rahe selectors apane kshetra kii cricket ko acchhee tarah samajhate or chayan ke dauraan swayan nahin to vahaan kii satta main baithe logon dwaara kuch purvagrahon se grasit jarur honge
 Whose influence has also been rarely seen during selection
 karnataka, mumbai kaa hoga ekadhikaar?ab keval purv test cricketer hi iske liye yogya honge or wo bhi ritairement ke paanch varsh baad
 The most senior cricketer will be the chairman of the panel of selectors
 test maichon kaa anubhav bhi apni role adaa karegaa
 Eligible candidates who have represented the country in odis and T20s are unlikely to be selected in the selection committee
 is desh ne 1932 ke baad se ab tak kul 286 test cricketer die hai
 Of these, the cricketers who have passed away in the last five years, along with the aged and the unwell, are left with no option
 isse bhi mahatvapurn sawaal yah he ki kya test cricket main majboot rahe mumbai or karnataka kaa ab chayan samiti par ekadhikaar to nahin ho jayega
 Overall, the question arises that after this change, what will be the nature of BCCI, the world's richest institution
 players association kaa hoga gathrub kaig se namankit vyakti isaki sarvocch nikaay main shaamil hoga jo board ke acount kii monitering bhi karegaa
 This is seen as an intervention by the government but the Supreme Court has assured that only the person nominated by the CAG will monitor the flow of money
 isse state board ko mil rahe manamaane fund par bhi niyantran bana rahegaa
 Till a few years ago, cricketers were not heard in the cricket operations of the country
 yah bada hi ajeeb sunne main lagata he ki cricket kaa sabase dhani raashtra bharat test cricket khilne vaale mulkon main aisa ekmaatr desh he jisamen koi players union nahin he
 In the operation of cricket without any players association, the cricketers could not raise their voice till now with the test calendar and busy schedule
 haa, yahaan yah bataanaa jaruri he ki pichley kuch saalon main isamen jarur badlaav aayaa he
 For a long time there was no player contract system in Indian cricket which was introduced in 2003
 bhrashtachar mukt hogi bisisiai?ab ek players association gathit hoga jisamen do cricketer, ek mahila or ek purush, board kii is sarvocch parishad ke sadsy honge
 That is, in the coming time, the voice of a cricketer will be heard as a player
 haalanki fifa jaise bade footbal sanghathan ko dekhte hue yah kahana mumkin nahin he ki players ke cricket sanchaalan se judane ke baad yah khel bhrashtachar se puri tarah mukt ho jayega
 Yes, this is definitely the beginning of an attempt to reform
 congress or rakanpa (congress-ncp) philhal shivasena ke saath gathbandhan karne par vichaar kar rahi he
 Presidential rule was imposed in the state on 12 November
 ek bayaan main athavle ke hawaale se kaha gaya he ki congress ke samarthan main banane vaali sarkaar main sirf shivasena or NCP ko baari-baari se mukhyamantri kaa pad milegaa
 BJP ally Athawale said that Congress should not support the new alliance if it does not get the post of Chief Minister
 congress ek rashtriya party he
 Explain that earlier Ramdas Athawale had suggested a new formula between BJP and Shiv Sena for formation of government in Maharashtra
 jiske tahat 3 saal mukhyamantri pad bijepi (BJP) ke liye or 2 saal shivasena ke liye ho saktaa he
 It is known that in the 288-member Maharashtra Assembly, BJP has 105 seats, Shiv Sena has 56 seats, while NCP and Congress have 54 and 44 seats respectively

 The Central Government justified not dissolving the Assembly after Arvind Kejriwal's resignation from the Chief Minister of Delhi, saying that it was done in 'public interest' and the possibility of BJP claiming to form the government cannot be ruled out
 
 sheersh adaalat main daakhil halafname main sarkaar ne daleel di he ki itani kam avadhi main chunaav karana janhit main nahin tha jaisi ki uparajyapal ne sifarish kii thi
 The Center has filed this affidavit in response to the notice of the court on the petition filed for not dissolving the Vidhan Sabha 
 halafname main kaha gaya he, 'uparajyapal ne do kaaran die the ki disambar ke pehle saptaah main sampann chunaav ke baad 28 disambar, 2013 ko hi sarkaar kaa gathan hua tha or isliye in paristhitiyon main itani kam avadhi main aglaa chunaav karana na to uchit tha or na hi janhit main tha
