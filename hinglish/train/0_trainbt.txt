 ' Ajit Jogi, the chief of the Janata Congress Chhattisgarh, who is contesting elections in Chhattisgarh in alliance with the BSP, said earlier that he can also join the BJP in the event of not getting majority
 kyonki raajnneeti main kisi sambhaavna se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa
 On this statement, political agitation in Chhattisgarh increased, Ajit Jogi was seen turning away from his statement on Friday
 unhone basapa mukhiya mayawati kii maujuudagi main safai di ki bahut na milane par bijepi ke saath jane kii baat kabhi nahin kii
 BSP chief Mayawati has made it clear that in the event of not getting a majority in the Chhattisgarh assembly elections, she will neither form an alliance with the BJP nor with the Congress
 unhone NDTV se baat karte hue kaha ki vah na BJP ke saath jaaengi, na congress ke saath, ek 'saanpnath he to ek nagnath
 ' mayawati ne kaha ki hamen puraa yakeen he ki hamen puraa bahumat milegaa
 i am completely convinced of this
 unhone kaha ki agar hamen janadesh nahin mila to ham vipaksh main baithna pasand karenge
 We will neither go with BJP nor with Congress
 ye donon party garib logon or dabe kuchle logon kii hitaishi party nahin he
 He said that we would like to sit in the opposition, but i am confident that the way our coalition parties are working, we will get a full majority
 tippaniyan Earlier, when Ajit Jogi was asked that suppose you come as the largest party, but you need the support of any party for majority, which party will you go to first, Congress or BJP? In response, Ajit Jogi said that when we reach that position, we will cross the border
 is samay hamen apane dam par sarkaar banane kaa puraa bharosa he
 After this, when he was asked that if you have to break the boundaries, then you are not ruling out the possibility of forming a government with the BJP? is par ajit jogi ne kaha ki raajnneeti main aap kisi bhi sambhaavna se inkaar nahin kar sakate
 So anything can happen
 lekin mujhe puraa bharosa he ki aisi sthiti nahin aegi
 Earlier, Congress leader PL Punia has said that Jogi has opened his cards by making a statement to go with BJP
 unhone NDTV se kaha ki hamen naa bispi kii zarurat he naa kisi or kii
 Mayawati said that we are very sure that we will get full majority
 main iske liye puri tarah se aashwast hum
 He said that if we do not get the mandate then we would like to sit in the opposition
 ham na bijepi ke saath jaaenge or na hi congress ke saath
 These two parties are not the friendly party of the poor and the downtrodden
 unhone kaha ki ham vipaksh main baithna pasand karenge, lekin mujhe puraa bharosa he ki jis tarah se hamaari gathbandhan partiyaan kaam kar rahi hai, hamen puraa bahumat milegaa
 The comments isse pehle ajit jogi se jab yah poocha gaya tha ki maan lijie ki aap sabase badi party banakar aae, lekin aapako bahumat ke liye kisi dal kaa samarthan chahie, sabase pehle aap kis party ke paas jaaenge, congress yaa bijepi? iske jawaab main ajit jogi ne kaha tha ki ham jab us sthiti main pahunchenge to seemaa paar karenge
 At this time we are confident of forming the government on our own
 iske baad jab unase poocha gaya tha ki agar aapako simaaen todani pade to bijepi ke saath milakar sarkaar banane kii sambhaavna se inkaar nahin kar rahe hai? On this Ajit Jogi said that in politics you cannot rule out any possibility
 isliye kuch bhi ho saktaa he
 But i am confident that such a situation will not come
 isse pehle congress netaa piel puniya ne kaha he jogi ne bijepi ke saath jane kaa bayaan dekar apane pattey khol die hai

 input :IANS Former Indian Navy Kulbhushan Jadhav was sentenced to sudden death in Pakistan
 aise saaf sanket hai ki bharat-nepal seemaa par pakade gaye pakistani sena ke ek afasar par hindustani karrwai ke dar se paak sena ne jaldibaji main ye kadam uthaaya he
 Various speculations are being made by journalists of both countries on social media alleging conspiracy
 lekin ek baat to kaaman he ki leftinent karnal mo
 Habib is missing in Nepal
 to kya pakistani karrwai pakistan sena ke adhikari ke nepal main apharan se sambandhit he? yadi haa, to yah koi aam prachlan kii baat nahin he
 The Indian side believes that Pakistan's motive behind punishing Kulbhushan Jadhav is that India should also be forced to declare action against Lieutenant Colonel Habib
 vahiin, pakistani paksh kaa maananaa he ki jadhav par paak karrwai se pehle bharat ne habib ko giraftaar kar liya, taaki baatcheet ke liye majaboor kiya ja sake
 India has rejected charge of espionage against Jadhav, a former Indian Navy personnel

 All indications so far are from media reports
 soshal media par kuch pakistani aarope laga rahe hai ki bharat ne habib ko isliye giraftaar kiya he, taaki jadhav ko chhudaane ke liye pakistan par dabaav banaaya ja sake
 The news of the kidnapping of the Pakistani officer from Nepal has not even been fully clear that Pakistan has sentenced the Indian officer to death
 somvaar ko pakistani sena kii court ne jadhav ko maut kii sajaa sunai he
 India has strongly opposed the Pakistani action

 Jadhav was accused of working for Raw in Pakistan
 unako 3 march, 2016 ko baluchistan se giraftaar kiya gaya tha
 For example, some Pakistanis allege that Pakistani Army officer Lt Col Mohammad Habib, who went missing from Lumbani, Nepal on 6 April, is in the custody of Indian investigative agencies

 bataaya ja rahaa he ki 2014 main ritred hone ke baad habib ek privet form ke liye kaam karte the
 He came to Nepal in connection with the job
 unke parijanon kii maane to nepal aane ke baad habib ne ek selfi bheji thi
 He had said that he had reached Nepal safely
 habib ne pakistan ke lahore se nepal ke kathmandu ke liye udaan bhari thi
 After this, he went to Lundni, a Buddhist site located on the Indian border
 iske baad se unka koi pataa nahin he

 In this way, he has reached the record for the best bowling performance in a match in this shortest format of cricket
 antarrashtriya cricket main yah aisi uplabdhi he jise isse pehle koi bhi bhartiya hasil nahin kar paaya tha
 In Test cricket, Anil Kumble managed to take all ten wickets in an innings but still he could not reach the number one position in the list of best bowling performance in an innings
 kumble ne 1999 main nayi dilli main pakistan ke khilaaf duusari pari main 74 ran dekar sabhi das wicket liye the lekin tab bhi vah gym lekar ke 1956 main banaaye gayi 53 ran dekar chah wicket ke ricard ko nahin tod paye the

 aise vishyon par jinase samaaj zyada prabhavit hota he, santon kaa maargdarshan mahatvapurn hota he
 "not only during Peshwai, but also from the many pandals and hoardings in the huge fair area in Ujjain, it seems that the saints and ascetics who left the society in search of God are still aware of their responsibilities towards the society
 
 isi kaa parinaam he ki prakhar maharaj ne mela kshetra main 50 bistaron kaa aspataal sthapit kiya he jisamen rogiyon kaa ni:shulk ilaaj hoga
 It also has a fully air-conditioned operation theater which will provide all types of treatment facilities except for complicated operations like brain and heart
 prakhar paroapkaar mishan kaa aisa hi aspataal 2013 main elahabaad kumbh main bhi sthapit kiya gaya tha or 2010 main haridwar kumbh ke dauraan mishan ne 100 bistaron vaala aspataal banaaya tha
 By the way, Prabhar Philanthropy Mission has a permanent eye hospital at Nabha in Patiala district
 rajasthan ke hanumangarh jile ke sangariyaa main bhi mishan kaa saamaanya aspataal he
 Apart from this, the mission is also working for the promotion of education
 prabhu premi sangh ke madhyam se anek seva prakalp chalaane vaale june akhaade ke acharya mahamandaleshwar avadheshanand giri kehete hai, ''sirf sant samaaj hi aisa he jo praapt daan kaa 99 fisadi se bhi adhik samaaj kaaryon main lagaataa he
 Today, besides saints, who is worrying about the environment, who is speaking against pollution of rivers? With the efforts of Swami Awadheshanand, hundreds of millions of saplings were planted in the Himalayan region to protect the environment which has become trees today
 ujjain main unke shivi main bhi 10 bistaron kaa ek aspataal banaaya gaya he
 They raise the question, "there are 40 lakh ngos operating in the country which receive huge amount of money from the government as well as from abroad
 is rakam kaa or in enjio ke kaaryon kaa akalan kiya jaae to sari sthiti spasht ho jaaegi ki kya ho rahaa he
 On the other hand there are Sadhu Samaj and Akhara who are engaged in their work without any publicity
 ''niranjani akhaade se jude mahamandaleshwar swami satyamitranand giri ne bhi apane saamaajik kaaryon ke jariye misaal kaayam kii he
 He campaigned fiercely against the stereotypes while holding the post of Shankaracharya of Bhanpura Peeth
 unhone adivaasiyon kii seva ke liye apana pad tak chhod diya tha
 One such saint is Swami Chidananda Saraswati who is known as 'muniji'
 unhone havan-pravachan ko hi paryaavaran seva kaa madhyam bana liya he
 They have been trying for years to purify the Ganges through the Ganga Action Plan
 rishikesh main nity ganga aarti ke madhyam se puraa desh unhen pahachaanata he
 Now through Ujjain Kumbh they want to spread awareness to keep the river sacred and Sadaniira
 unhone yahaan kshipraa aarti kaa silsilaa bhi shuru karavaaya he
 Swami Chidananda says, "during the Simhastha Mahakumbh of 2004, water from the Gambhir river was transported to Kshipra
 2016 main narmada kaa jal kshipraa nadi main laayaa gaya he
 But our effort is that the royal baths in Simhastha Mahakumbh of 2028 should be performed in their waters of Kshipra
 lekin iske liye abhi se prayaas shuru karnaa jaruri he
 Swami emphasizes the need to plant trees along the river for the sake of preserving the Chidananda River
 ve kshipraa ko pravaahman banaae jane kii jarurat bataate hai or ganga acshan plan kii tarj par kshipraa acshan plan taiyaar kar rahe hai
 He has also discussed this issue with Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan and after getting positive answers from them, he is planning ahead
 iske liye ve ujjainvaasiyon ko bhi jaagruk kar rahe hai
 They are trying to have the message of protecting the environment in the hands of every monk and saint during the royal bath on 9 May
 swami chidanand kehete hai, ''kshipraa main barish kaa pani hona chahie or barish ko aakarshith karne ke liye uske kinaaron par vrikshon kii shrunkhlaa honi chahie
 "another saint who has contributed towards social service is Brahmalin Karpatri Maharaj called Dharmasamrat who founded the All India Religion
" unke isi dharmasangh ke madhyam se varanasi main garib bacchon ke liye ni:shulk awasaiya shiksha prakalp chalaane vaale swami shankardev chaitanya brahmacharee kehete hai, ''sadhu-sant apane ghar or parivaar tyaagate jarur hai lekin is kram main puraa vishwa hi unka parivaar ho jaataa he
 His work is done with the spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam and the intention of survey Bhavantu Sukhin
 ''isi bhaavana ke saath niranjani akhaade se jude mahamandaleshwar swami paramanand giri kii shishyaa sadhvi rutambhraa ne uttar pradesh ke vrundavan main vatsalya gram kii sthapana kar kanyaon, peedit or beghar mahilaon ko sammaan or surakshit awaas uplabdh karavaaya he
 In this way, Didi, who was called the firebrand Sadhvi, started to be called 'mother'
 ab madhya pradesh ke omkareshwar or himachal pradesh ke solan ke saath-saath gujarat main bhi mahilaon or ladakiyon ke liye vatsalya gram sthapit kiye ja rahe hai jahaan ve ek parivaar kii tarah rahengi jabaki chhatarpur main mahilaon ke liye vyavsaayik prashikshan santhaan banane kii yojana bhi he
 Sadhvi Satyapriya, who is looking after the arrangement of Sadhvi Ritambhara's camp in Ujjain Mahakumbh, says, "in Vatsalya village, not only girls get shelter but their education is also properly managed
 ''isi tarah yuva sant shri balak yogeshwar das samaaj ke ek varg ke liye bade bhai kii bhoomika nibhaa rahe hai
 They are performing a yajna to pay tribute to the martyred soldiers and to offer their condolences to the bereaved family
 ujjain main bhukhi mata mandir ke saamne bani unki vishaal yajyashala ke shikhar par bharat mata kii tasviir lagi he or yajyashala tirange main rangi dikhaai detii he
 While living in Jammu and Kashmir, the children, who had been watching the military father and military brother as well as other soldiers since childhood, became sadhus at the age of 10 years, but they had special place for the soldiers
 yahi vajah rahi ki unhone 2006 main major ajay jasrotiya kii smriti main yajna kaa aayojan kiya
 He was also emotionally attached to Major
 uske baad to unhone shahid pariwaron ko ekatra kar sirf shaheedon ke kalyaan ke liye hi yajna kaa kram shuru kar diya
 He performed a similar yajna in the Dras sector of Kargil in which more than 500 relatives of the martyrs reached
 ujjain main yah is tarah kaa 25waan yajna hoga
 The child Yogeshwar Das says, "A monk is also a human, not a stone
" use bhi dukh hota he lekin apane gyaan ke madhyam se vah is dukh se baahar nikal aata he
 Yajna is a symbol of this in memory of the martyrs
 '' yajna ke madhyam se hi paryaavaran shuddh karne kaa sankalp karne vaale mahamandaleshwar avadhoot arun giri maharaj june akhaade se jude mahayogi payalat baba ke shishy hai or envyranment baba kehalaate hai
 It was with this spirit of service that Swami Pranavanand Maharaj founded the Bharat Sevashram Sangha in 1917 which is now entering its 100th year
 vigat 99 saal se lagaataar seva kaary karne vaala sanyasiyon kaa yah sanghathan vartmaan sanchaalak swami madhavanand kii aguai main 200 tairaakon ke saath kshipraa nadi par seva karegaa
 Medical facilities will also be available in their camp and there will also be an ambulance facility along with blood pressure and bone density test, blood sugar test for diabetic patients and ECG test for heart patients
 yahaan par 10 bed kaa aspataal bhi banaaya gaya he
 By the way, the Sangh has a 500-bed permanent hospital in Kolkata
 gaanvon main chal chikitsaalay ke madhyam se seva kaary karata he or iske saath hi shiksha ke liye skool-college kaa sanchaalan bhi sangh karata he
 For the past several years, volunteers from Bharat Sevashram Sangh have been arriving immediately in various parts of the country due to flood or drought or any other natural disaster
 yun to lagbhag sabhi sadhu-sant apane pravachanon ke madhyam se samaaj ko sahi disha dikhaane kaa kaam to karte hi hai lekin khud aage badhkar, apane vyavhaar main aisa udhaaharan pesh karnaa or badlaav kaa bidaa uthaanaa sahi myne main parivartankaree he

 There is no doubt that Narendra Modi is the most popular leader of the country and also very popular among the youth
 rudhivaadee sanghathan aresas se judaav ke baavjood unhone kabhi aisi koi baat nahin kii ki unhen bhi usee varg kaa samajha jaae
 On the contrary, he is always considered the leader of modern thinking
 jab unhone uttar pradesh ke dondia kheda main sone ke khajaane kii khoj kaa majaak udaaya to sabhi ne unke aadhunik khyaalon kii tarif kii
 His saying that the government has replaced the country by digging there was logical
 unke bayaan se aisa prathit hua ki ve rudhiwaad or saadhuon-panditon kii baatcheet par yakeen nahin karte, lekin ab achaanak hi unhone sur badal diya
 Now Modi said, 'shobhan Sarkar is such a saint to whom millions of people have faith and i salute his penance and sacrifice
 'unke bayanon main yah badlaav ascharyajanak he or aisa lagata he ki vah rudhivaadee tatwon ke dabaav main aa gaye hai
 Or it may be that his earlier statement was given for some other reason
 baharhaal jo bhi ho, pradhan mantri pad kii daavedaari karne vaale shaks kaa is tarah se apana stand badalanaa behad atapata he
 It does not match his personality
 agar vah desh ke yuvaaon ke netaa bananaa chaahate hai or unke adarsh ke rup main apane ko sthapit karnaa chaahate hai to unhen dakiyanoosee vichaaron se dur rahanaa hoga jo unhone pehle kiya tha
 Instant change of views can happen due to political reasons but it gives wrong signals and it also creates misconceptions about his strong personality
 sant shobhan sarkaar, ho saktaa he ek tyaagi purush hon jo apane liye kuch nahin karte lekin modi kaa ek din unke kaaran sarkaar kii aalochana karnaa or duusare din phir palat janaa, modi ke vaicharik drushtikon ke bare main sawaal khadey kar saktaa he

 There will also be a barn to keep track of how many trumps lie
 washington post ke daftar main stool par bitha diya hoga ki lo gino ki raashtrapati kitna jhooth bolte hai
 Now he has counted that till now, during his tenure, 8,158 have given false and misleading statements
 yah khabar duniya bhar main chap gai he
 Nobody thought how much this would affect the lie
 bharat ko lekar main bilkul chintit nahin hum
 i am sure that there will be competition for lying here and there will be someone who will be determined to defeat Trump
 aisa kaise ho saktaa he ki ham log trump se zyaada jhooth nahin bol sakate
 Have to show it by speaking one day
 tabhi hamaara duniya main ofishili naam hoga
 Such names are there
 washington post kii khabar ne mujhe niraash kiya he
 The fun of telling lies is not to keep an account
 na hi sunne vaale ko hisaab rakhana chahie
 If someone starts counting now, it becomes difficult for a man to speak
 netaa to janata ke bich kuch bol hi nahin paaegaa
 Instead of clapping, public 1001, 1002,1003 will shout
 netaa bina bole hi janata ke bich aayega or haath hilaakar chalaa jayega
 Even before Trump, the leaders have been lying
 magar unki ginati nahin hui he
 i think the purpose of counting lies is to silence the leaders
 satya kii hameshaa se kami rahi he
 There is also a lot of trouble in speaking the truth
 ek to satya kya he ise hi lekar bade bade log pareshaan hai
 Some were so upset that they left their families and went to the forest
 kuch ne yuddh main apane mitra se puch kar kaam chalaaya
 Always have to ask another wise person
 satya sabake bas kii baat nahin he
 One should practice for truth
 sadhana ke liye time
 Time is disturbed by traffic jams
 isliye aaj ke jivan ke anukool jhooth hi thik he
 What are those powers that want Trump to fall into the mess of truth, then waste his time in search of it
 mujhe trump kii yah baat pasand he ki ve aam nagarikon kii tarah raashtrapati banane ke baad bhi jhooth bol rahe hai
 President people do not need lies but they are speaking
 mujhe yakeen he ki trump jhooth bolne kii kala ke kaaran skool jivan main bhi behtareen dost yaar rahe honge
 There will always be new excuses for vacation
 doston kii madad karte honge
 From bad stomach to grandma to sick, he would have made more excuses than boring excuses
 aaj unki vajah se jhooth kii vailu bad gai he varna log yaad bhi nahin rakhte the
 i am proud that Trump has been improving his ability to lie
 desh ke liye agar kuch karnaa he to pehle jhooth ke liye bhi kuch na kuch karnaa hoga
 5 every day in the first year of his term
 6 jhooth bolte the
 They 16 in the second year
 5 jhooth har rose bol rahe hai
 Think how creative their mind will be
 ek jhooth bolnaa mushkil pad jaataa he
 They 16 every day
 5 jhooth bolte hai
 Vav! Trump has turned the White House into a white lie
 yah badi baat he
 i do not want anyone to match the trump
 balki dua karuunga ki trump har din 20 jhooth tak bolen
 Rather, if you have 24 hours in a day, then at least tell 24 lies
 bharat main thik he ki koi jhooth nahin gin rahaa he
 If India has to match America, it has to free the lie
 usamen riform 2
 Must bring 0
 taaki jhooth bolne ke liye tathyon kii jaanch se guzaranaa nahin pade
 Best wishes to all those who are making efforts in India
 maine kisi kaa naam nahin liya he
 So, do not let the world know that you have been pointed out by lying in the comment box
 trump ne apane kaarykaal ke pehle 100 din main hi bataa diya tha ki ve jhooth ko lekar udaar hai
 Will do something different
 trump ko pataa tha ki unka jhooth gina ja rahaa he
 Even after this, he did not stop the lie
 bharat main bhi log trump kii barabari kii koshish kar rahe hai
 Since there is no file in India, it disappears, so there is no correct data
 jab naukari ke aankade nahin hai to jhooth ke aankade kahaan se mil jaaenge
 Wish it was counted even in India, today our leaders are being discussed in front of the world instead of Trump
 8,158 jhooth bhi koi bataane kii chiz he
 If we count the lies of our leaders, Trump will start speaking the truth
 unhen pataa he ki bharat ke netaa kuch bhi kar len, satya nahin bol sakate hai
 Our leaders do not come to the city to speak the truth, they go to the forest
 vahiin jaakar ekant main satya khojate hai
 Happily, even today, the leaders go to the forest

 On Saturday itself, BJP had asked Shatrughan Sinha to praise Nitish Kumar, saying that such statements are damaging the party's image
 jediu ke pravaktaa sanjay singh ne kaha ki unki party ke daravaaje sinha ke liye hameshaa khule hue hai

 '' is saal june main devendra fadanvis, mukhyamantri se adhik ek termineter prathit ho rahe the
 He was responding to allegations of opposition that he had failed on all fronts
 vah june main vidhansabha satr kaa antim din tha or fadanvis aatmavishvaas se bhare the
 He was confident that he would be the first Chief Minister of the state to complete his tenure after the late Vasantrao Naik in 1972
 24 aktubar ko fadanvis ne duusari baar itihaas rachaa
 He is now the first non-congress chief minister in the state's 59-year history to return to power
 aktubar 2014 main, nitin gadakari or ekanath khadse jaise party diggajon kii jagah unhen rajya ke netritv ke liye chunaa gaya tha
 The results on October 24 show that the party may have won 17 seats less than in 2014 but remained the undisputed leader
 fadanvis ne vaapasi to kii he, lekin badale hue rajnatik paridrishy main
 The bjp's victory suggests that voters are ready to give him one more chance, but with one condition
 fadanvis ko ek aise sahyogi shivasena se nipatna hoga, jisane 56 siton par kabja karke apana chauthaa sarvshereshth pradarshan kiya
 Already, Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray has expressed his ambitions
 guuruuvaar ko jab nattejey aa hi rahe the, us dauraan ek press conference main unhone kaha ki gathbandhan sarkaar banane kaa daawa tab tak nahin karegaa, jab tak ki satta main hissedari kaa formula tay nahin ho jaataa
 "we want a 50-50 partnership in power," he told reporters
 '' is bich, fadanvis ne thakare kaa saamana karne se parhez kiya
 He claimed that the formula for power sharing has already been decided
 unhone kaha, ''ham sahi samay par iskaa khulaasa karenge
 The opposition's performance was also not very bad
 kaha ja rahaa tha ki sharad pavaar kii rashtravaadi congress party (rakanpa) ab khatm ho rahi he lekin usne 2014 ke mukaable 13 adhik siten jeetin
 The Congress also won 44 seats, two more than the previous election
 ek maayoos or netavihin party ke liye yah pradarshan asaadhaaran mana jayega
 Let us remind you that there is a lot of arrogance in the party's Mumbai unit
 party tuutane ke kagaar par khadi najar aati thi, kai netaa paala badalane ko taiyaar the
 Among the former presidents of the Mumbai Congress, Kripa Shankar Singh has left the party while Sanjay Nirupam openly criticized the ticket distribution
 siton kii sankhya ghatane ke baavjood fadanvis kii jeet isliye prabhaavshaalee he kyonki ve ek aisi savarna jati se taalluk rakhte hai jisaki sankhya bahut kam he
 The powerful Marathas were against him and most of the senior BJP leaders in the state were unhappy with his style of functioning
 bhaajapa or shivasena ne may 2019 main rajya kii 48 loksabhaa siton main se 41 siten jeet lee thim
 The bjp-shiv Sena alliance led in 227 assembly seats in the state
 to, chah maheene main aisa kya ho gaya? fadanvis party ke 2014 ke pradarshan ko kyon nahin doharaa sake? ek pramukh kaaran is varsh july-agast main pune, kolhapur, sangli or satara sahit pashchimi maharashtra main baadh se nipatane main sarkaar kii naakaami thi
 This is the region where NCP has won the most seats (28)
 baadh main kam se kam 50 logon kii maut ho gai, lekin sarkari tantra ne sthiti se nipatane main dhilaai barti
 In the first two days of this crisis, the government was nowhere to be seen
 vastav main, us samay fadanvis rajyavyapee maha janadesh yatra par the
 The bjp's move to tighten the ed's grip on Sharad Pawar backfired only on a personal complaint
 isse jivan ke sattar ke dashak main pahunche pavaar ke liye ek sahanubhuti lahar paidaa hui
 He cleverly strengthened his base among the Marathas through this and the NCP won 54 seats
 bhaajapa ne congress or rakanpa ke 35 netaaon ko apane paale main kiya tha lekin isse party ke pradarshan main koi sudhaar na hua; unamem keval 16 hi jite
 The ncp's performance has put a halt to the speculation of its merger with the Congress, at least for now
 nateezon ke din pavaar ne shivasena ke saath kisi bhi tarah ke gathjod se inkaar kar diya or rakanpa ab rajya main sabase badi vipakshi party he
 The issue of Pawar's political successor has also been resolved with the victory of his grandson Rohit from karjat-jamkhed
 haalanki, yah dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki kya pavaar bhattije ajit yaa phir obisi netaa dhananjay munde ko vipaksh ke netaa ke rup main chunate hai, jinhone parali main apni chacheri bahan or mahila tathaa bal kalyaan mantri pankaja munde ko haraakar badi kamyaabi hasil kii he
 Fadnavis was the only leader in the BJP who wanted to take Shiv Sena along in the elections
 unki ichha ab puri ho gai he, unhen apratyaashit rup se haaavee rahane vaale sahyogi kaa prabandhan karnaa hoga
 Shiv Sena with 56 seats is close to its 2014 figure of 64 seats while BJP has lost 17 seats
 uddhav thakare haaavee hone main koi kasar nahin chodenge
 Shiv Sena leader Anil Desai says that the party expects Fadnavis to fulfill his promise of giving 50 percent stake in power
 puri sambhaavna he ki thakare apane logon ke liye mahatvapurn mantralay hasil karne ke liye kadi saudebaaji karenge
 They will insist on fulfilling promises such as lunch for 10 rupees, annual allowances of 10,000 rupees to the farmers, closure of the chemical refinery in Konkan and the coastal road project in Mumbai, which was banned by the High Court this year
 fadanvis kii najar do sahyogiyon ke saath bhaajapa-shivasena ke 13 baagiyon par he jo nirdaleey chunaav jitkar vidhayak bane hai
 He says, "I have contacted them all
" ''haalanki shivasena ke apane garh mumbai main haarane par thakare ko chintaa kerani hogi
 In Bandra (east), where Thackeray resides, Mumbai Mayor Vishwanath Mahadeshwar lost to Zeeshan Siddiqui of Congress
 yah dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki kya thakare bete aditya ko mantrimandal main shaamil karne kaa faisla karte hai yaa unhen kisi bhi jimmedaari ko sweekaar karne se pehle 'vidhayika ke maamalon ko jaanane' kaa samay dete hai
 One thing is clear - Aditya will not become the Deputy Chief Minister, which was expected by some Shiv Sena leaders
 agle paanch varshon main focus fadanvis par rahegaa
 The thin margin of his victory may actually work in his favor
 chunaav se pehle, party ke netaaon ne dabi jubaan se yah kahana shuru kiya tha ki bhaajapa rajya main shandaar jeet darj karti he to fadanvis ko dilli bhej diya jayega
 The logic was that anyone can run the state
 lekin gathbandhan kii jeet kaa antar ghat jane ke kaaran fadanvis ko maharashtra main hi rahanaa hoga
 The return of the Congress is also no less a matter of concern for him
 ek ke baad kai haar ke baavjood party ne rajya main apni sthiti majboot kii to uske peeche vijay, jinhen balasaheb thoraat ke naam se janaa jaataa he, or ashok chavaan jaise sthaneey kshatrapon kii badi bhoomika he
 Maharashtra Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant admitted that he needed to introspect as to why he could not win the hearts of the people
 haalanki, unka kahana he ki chunaav parinaamon ne party main ''nai urja'' bhar di he
 If the party has improved its performance in the state, it is also expected that leaders like Milind Deora and Sanjay Nirupam will be barred from changing their ranks
 rajya congress main yuvaaon ko tarjeeh dene ke liye pherbadal bhi sambhav he
 The last few weeks have been very encouraging for Fadnavis as the media had been making predictions of his fierce victory in the state
 lekin aane vaale kuch hakrate unke liye chunauteepurn honge kyonki is dauraan unki kshamta kii parakh hogi
 By the way, for this young chief minister, problems are not new
 jab party ne 2014 kaa chunaav bina mukhyamantri ke chehre ke ladgaye kaa faisla kiya, tab fadanvis is pad kii res main aage bhi nahin the
 The party's original organization, RSS, was also raising doubts about their acceptance in the Maratha-dominated state
 us samay tak rajya ke 17 mukhyamantriyon main se das maratha samudaay se hi rahe the
 Fadnavis is a Brahmin and belongs to the backward Vidarbha region of the state
 is pad ke liye unhen kaise chunaa gaya, iske peeche ek kahani he
 He was the president of the state BJP in 2014
 loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan modi unki prachaar style se prabhavit hue
 All senior BJP leaders, including the late Gopinath Munde, were predicting 35 Lok Sabha seats for the bjp-shiv Sena alliance in Maharashtra, when Fadnavis said with great confidence that the alliance would win 41 seats
 unka akalan sahi sabit hua tha
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi said at a rally in the Chief Minister's hometown during the 2014 assembly elections, "nagpur has the most precious gift to the country in the form of Devendra Fadnavis
" '' tab fadanvis ko ehsaas hua ki ve agle mukhyamantri ho sakate hai
 It has never been easier to rule Maharashtra
 48 loksabhaa siton vaala rajya, 80 siton vaale uttar pradesh ke baad duusare sthaan par aata he
 It is the most industrialized state in the country with 13 percent of the country's production sector and 17 percent of the service sector
 vasantrao nik ke baad se rajya ke har mukhyamantri, is rajya ko chalaane main sangharsh karte hi najar aae hai
 Barring Shankarrao Chavan, Vasantdada Patil, Sharad Pawar and Sudhakarrao Naik, everyone sitting on the Chief Minister's chair had to step down due to allegations of corruption or incapacity (chavan and Pawar stepped down as Chief Ministers at the Center)
 fadanvis ke liye bhi paanch saal aasaan nahin rahe
 Attack on farmers, Marathas and Dalits in koregaon-bhima, their political skills were tested in three major movements
 fadanvis kehete hai ki in muddon se nipatane ke kram main ve dhairyavan shrota ban gaye hai
 The turning point of his government was the reservation movement of the Maratha community in the state in the last months of 2016
 maratha samudaay ne rajya main 57 bade march kaa aayojan kiya, jisamen hajaaron kii taadaad main logon ne shirkat kii
 He said that the only way to restore the deteriorating credibility of the community is reservation in government jobs and education
 party main bhi fadanvis ke virdohi aawaaj buland karne lage
 Several leaders, including party president Amit Shah, started considering him
 pareshaan fadanvis ne apana aapa nahin khoyaa
 He started backdoor conversations with Maratha community leaders and intensified the formalities of bringing the community under the purview of reservation
 ve kehete hai, ''maine siikhaa ki dhiraj kaa fal meetha hota he
 "fadnavis restructured the sluggish Maharashtra Backward Classes Commission, so that any legal initiative is legitimate
" ayog ne maratha samudaay ko nae sire se saamaajik or aarthik rup se pichhadaa ghoshit kiya to mukhyamantri ne use 16 fisad aarakshan dene kaa vidheyak 27 june, 2019 ko vidhansabha main paas karvaa liya
 The High Court reduced this to 13 percent in government jobs and 12 percent in educational institutions
 phir bhi yah fadanvis ke liye badi jeet thi
 It was also in his favor that he could retain the 23 percent reservation for obcs
 doosraa bada jhatka kisaanon kaa andelan tha
 In March 2018, farmers took to the road demanding better prices for the produce
 rajya lagaataar tisare saal sookhe kii chapet main tha
 Fadnavis called the left-leaning peasant leader Ajit Navale for talks and persuaded him to postpone the agitation
 unke is kadam se sabhi hairaan rah gaye
 Later in October 2018, Fadnavis under the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Shetkari Samman Yojana 1
 5 lakh ru
 Even announced a debt waiver
 karjamaafee ko aadhaar se jodgaye kii unki pahal se isamen paardarshita ai or farji tathaa 'jaali' khaaton kii pahchaan main madad mili
 Therefore, the number of actual beneficiaries has come down from 89 lakh to 52 lakh
 kisaan karjamaafee kii kul rakam bhi 32,000 karod ru
 22,000 crore from Rs
 par aa gai
 However, NCP chief Pawar is not convinced by this and the results of the election proved it
 vidhansabha chunaavon ke pehle india today se ek baatcheet main pavaar ne kaha tha, ''pichley paanch saal main fadanvis kii sabase badi uplabdhi kisaan sankat or audyogic mandi he
 In the Vidarbha region with the highest number of farmer suicides, the BJP lost 17 seats, which it won in 2014
 1 janvari, 2018 ko hui koregaanv-bhima hinsa ne bhi shaayad nateezon ko prabhavit kiya he
 Due to that violence, the social fabric of Maharashtra was threatening itself
 haalanki police ne shuruyaat main hindutvvaadi netaa, shiv pratishthan hindustan ke adhyaksh sambhaji bhide ko mukhya sandigdh bataaya tha lekin baad main ise maovadi sajeesh bataa diya gaya
 Fadnavis' position in the party will remain strong despite a relatively narrow margin of victory in the assembly elections
 ek vajah to yahi ki rajya main ab unke thode pratidwandvi hi batch gaye hai
 All his opponents were refused tickets
 behad mukhar rajasav mantri ekanath khadse se lekar ucch shiksha mantri vinod taavade or varisht party netaa prakaash mehta, raaj purohit sabhi baahar ho gaye hai
 Another opponent Pankaja Munde has also lost out to Parli
 team fadanvis main ab jal sansaadhan mantri girish mahajan, khaadya or aushadhi prashasan mantri jayakumar rawal, shram mantri sambhaji patil-nilangekar or obisi kaary mantri sanjay kute jaise vafaadaar hai (dekhen team fadanvis)
 It remains to be seen how Fadnavis pursues the Shiv Sena as the relationship between the two has been stormy for most of his first term
 fadavis ke liye badi chunautiyon badhati berogari, saamaajik suraksha or jal sankat se nijaat pani hogi
 In September this year, the unemployment rate in Maharashtra was 5, according to the Center for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) report
 7 fisad aanki gai he
 After three years of continuous drought, the average rainfall in the state this year is pegged at 99 percent
 rajya abhi bhi audyogic powerhouse bana hua he
 Fadnavis claims that Maharashtra has received 35 per cent of foreign direct investment (FDI) in the country in the last two years
 rajya main nivesh ke liye emoyu ko vaastavik pariyojnaon main badalane kii dar 40 fisad he
 Fadnavis will have to prove that he is serious about functioning
 ek lanbaa saaya naakaam foxcon saude kaa bhi he
 The Taiwanese phone maker announced an investment of $ 5 billion in 2015, but the condition was that it would have to give land near Mumbai and a 30 percent tax concession
 fadanvis shart puri nahin kar paae or company yah pariyojna rajya ke baahar lekar chali gai
 Fadnavis has taken up large infrastructure projects like Mumbai Metro, nagpur-mumbai Super Communication Highway, Navi Mumbai Airport, Trans Harbor Link
 trans harbar link mumbai ko nabha-sheva se jodega
 These projects are worth around Rs 3 lakh crore
 kii hai or inhen 2024 ke pehle puraa hona he
 The Trans Harbor link is still on paper
 abhi iskaa tender bhi jari nahin hua he
 He also has other big promises

 *** rail karmchaariyon ko 2013-14 ke liye diwaali bonus ke rup main 78 din kaa vetan milegaa
 This is equal to the bonus given for the last two years
 railway kii kharaab vittiya sthiti ke baavjood yah nirnay kiya gaya he
 Giving this information, a senior Railway Ministry official said that it has been decided to give 78 days salary as productivity-linked bonus (PLB) to the railway employees for 2013-14
 varsh 2011-12 tathaa 2012-13 main bhi rail karmchaariyon ko pielbi ke rup main 78 din kaa vetan diya gaya tha
 Railway employees are given productivity based bonus every year and more than 11 lakh non-gazetted railway employees will be benefited from this
 bonus bhugtan se railway par 800 karod rupee kii laagat aegi
 Although the Railway has issued an order for the bonus, it is yet to be approved by the Cabinet
 adhikariyon ke anusaar pradhanmantri narendra modi ke america yatra par tathaa vitt mantri arun jetali ke aspataal main hone ke kaaran rail mantri sadanand gauda pielbi prastaav par mantrimandal kii manjuuri nahin le paae
 The official said, the Cabinet approval on the decision will be taken later
 samay kii kami ke kaaran aadesh pehle jari kar diya gaya
 However, General Secretary of the All India Railwaymen's Federation, Shiv Gopal Mishra said, the railwaymen should have received more bonus, as production has increased this year since last year
 unhone kaha ki prayek paatr karmchaaree ko 8,975 rupee bonus milegaa or is saal kareeb 11
 5 lakh employees will get this
 gujarat main bhartiya janata party (bijepi) kii satta vaapasi kii dhamak bihar kii raajnneeti main bhi sunai de rahi he
 Political parties are refraining from speaking openly on this, but Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, who usually congratulated anyone on his victory, has not yet congratulated Chief Minister Narendra Modi
 bihar main sattarudh gathbandhan main ek ghatak, bijepi jahaan modi kii jeet par khushiyaan manaa rahi he, vahiin sarkaar ke duusare ghatak, janata dal (united) ke netaa is par khulkar koi pratikriya dene se parhez kar rahe hai
 It is not that BJP and JD (U) are seen face to face for the first time regarding Modi
 kai maamalon main modi ko lekar jad (yu) ke netaa asahaj dikhe
 Giriraj Singh, a senior minister and BJP leader from Bihar celebrating the victory, says that Modi has emerged as a leader after former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee
 agaami loksabhaa chunaav main koun pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar hoga yah party ko tay karnaa he
 But he believes that Modi should be projected as the future Prime Minister
 unhone kaha ki ab tak desh main vanshavaad, kshetravaad or sampradayikta kii raajnneeti hoti rahi he or modi ne is bich nai raajnneeti kaa itihaas rachaa he
 However, JD (U) leaders are not saying much about the Gujarat election results
 lekin unhone itnaa jarur kaha he ki gujarat ke parinaam kaa bihar kii raajnneeti main koi asar nahin padegaa
 Vashistha Narayan Singh, president of the JD (U) Bihar unit, says the Gujarat result will not have any impact on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA)
 unhone kaha ki desh ke kisi rajya main chunaav hone se uskaa asar kisi anya rajya par nahin hota he
 Here, JD (U) spokesperson Neeraj Kumar, when asked about Modi being made the Prime Ministerial candidate, said that the party has already clarified its position on the matter
 unhone kaha ki party pehle hi kah chuki he ki rajg aise vyakti ko apana ummidavaar ghoshit kare jo dharmanirpeksh ho or is par vah ab bhi kaayam he
 Although political analysts believe that the impact of the Gujarat result will not be seen in Bihar immediately, but it will definitely be seen in the future
 raajnneeti ke jaankaar surendra kishor ne kaha ki vartmaan samay main gujarat ke parinaam kaa bihar par koi asar nahin padegaa, lekin agar bijepi modi ko pradhanmantri ke rup main pesh karti he to bihar main gathbandhan tuutane kaa khatra paidaa ho jayega
 Which will affect future elections
 unhone kaha ki jad (yu) kaa maananaa he ki musalamaanon kaa vot uske saath he, or keval modi ko lekar vah muslim matadaataaon ko naaraaz nahin karnaa chahega
 In such a situation, the alliance will be affected
 vaise kishor kehete hai ki loksabhaa chunaav ke purv iskaa prabhaav ubhar kar saamne aayega
 It is noteworthy that BJP and JD (U) have come face to face several times in the name of Modi
 pichley vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne modi ke bihar aakar chunaav prachaar karne kaa khule taur par virodh kiya tha
 Earlier in 2010, Nitish also objected to the publication of his picture with Modi in an advertisement published in newspapers during the BJP national executive meeting

 The decisive mandate Chidambaram, not hung, wrote at the beginning of the article that Prime Minister Modi said in his interview that 'people in Telangana and Mizoram did not give a chance to BJP, while Chhattisgarh got a clear mandate against BJP
 rajasthan or madhya pradesh main trishanku vidhansabha kii haalat rahi
 In response to this, Chidambaram has written that Congress got a decisive mandate in three states except Mizoram and Telangana and there was nothing hung
 chhattisgarh main bijepi 34 seat haar gai (49 se 15), madhya pradesh main 56 (165 se 109) or rajasthan main 90 (163 se 73) siton kaa jhatka laga

 Is biased, Rafaelsoude did not listen to Air Force and Hindustan Aeronautical Limited and due to wrong policies, loan waiver of farmers has become mandatory
 chidambaram ne aage kaha, 'kuch aise mudde hai jin par pradhanmantri nahin bol rahe hai
 Such as unemployment, farmers' frustration and suicide, women safety, monitoring teams, discontent among people, Jammu and Kashmir, economy, cottage industries on the verge of closure, stalled projects, bankrupt companies, backward target of financial losses and eminent economists fleeing the government 
 ' chidambaram ne aage kaha, 'pradhanmantri aage ke bare main kuch nahin bataate, bas beeti baaten uthaate hai
 They do not say anything about how the condition of the people improved, how they returned to the economy
 unke report card ke har pej par fail likhaa he

 lekin andhrapradesh main modi lahar ke baad bhi vidhansabha chunaav main bhartiya janata party(bijepi) apana khaataa bhi nahin khol saki
 In many parts of the country, BJP is moving towards a historic victory, but there are two states where the Modi wave has not been affected
 odisha or andhra pradesh
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has congratulated Jagan Mohan Reddy, Naveen Patnaik, who have won the victory in both these states
 andhra pradesh kii 175 siton vaali vidhansabha main akele wiesar congress party ke paas 146 siton, telugu desham party ke paas 28 siten or jansena party ke paas 1 seat ai

 jab do the tab bhi niraash nahin hue or dobaaraa aae to bhi na sanskaar chodenge, na ardash chodenge or na hi namrata chodenge
 At the same time, BJP President Amit Shah has described this victory as historic
 unhone kaha ki yah aitihaasik jeet he
 After 50 years, a party has a chance to run the government with an absolute majority
 hamane 50 fisadi kii ladaai ladi or hamen 17 rajyon main 50 fisadi se zyada vot mili hai
 On the one hand, the people have given us a great majority and on the other the Congress has got a crushing defeat
 unhone rajyon ke naam ginate hue kaha ki congress 17 rajyon main apana khaataa nahin khol pai he
 This victory has made one more thing clear that for 50 years, Congress has done politics on the basis of familism

 How many opportunities will be given to the people to verify their claims and complaints
 jab ham sun rahe hai to jaahir he ki ham hi tay karenge

 Finally, the court also said that this is the last warning
 ainda aisa nahin hona chahie
 Now the court will next hear the matter on August 16
 tab rashtriya janaganana vibhaag ke secretary general sari detail bataaenge ki kis tarah se enarasi kaa kaam aage badhegaa

 If he gives a fresh document, his name will appear in the list

 a large herd of Babbar lion arrived on the state highway of Pipavav Port in Amreli district of Gujarat on Friday evening
 aap shaayad hi yakeen karen, lekin ham aapako ek kuch aisi tasviren or video dikhaane ja rahe hai, jise dekh kar aap bhi sihar jaaenge
 On Friday evening, a large herd of Babbar lion came on the road of Pipavav Port, in which a bike rider and a car driver were going with their family to Pipavav port and then not one or two but the whole 12 lions stopped the whole way
 Have taken is najaare ko dekhakar car chaalak ne is puri ghatana kaa video bana liya
 This large herd of Babbar lions walked on the road for about 15 minutes and then all the lions crossed the road and went towards the forest
 tab tak hive par trephic jam laga rahaa
 Significantly, the Asiatic babbar lions found in Gujarat are found only in the forests of Gir in the world
 ye sirf junagarh, amarelli or gir somnath jile main hi dekhne ko milte hai
 As of last count in May 2015, the number of lions is only 523
 gir kaa jangal 1413 varg kilometre main failaa hua he or sher kareeb 22000 varg kilometre aria main gum rahe hai
 So sometimes lion herds also come on the way
 magar is tarah se sheron kaa raaston par ghoomana unke ke liye bahut bada jokhim ho saktaa he
 Let me tell you that before this, many lions have been killed in road and train accidents
 may 2015 main hui aakhri ginati ke anusaar sheron kii shankhya sirf 523 he
 The Gir forest is spread over 1413 square kilometers and the lions roam in an area of about 22000 square kilometers
 isliye kabhi-kabhi sher ke jhund raste par bhi aa jate hai
 But this way lions can be a big risk for them to walk on the paths
 bataa den, isse pehle bhi sadak or train durghatnaon main kai sher maare ja chuke hai
 Foreign Minister Qureshi offered Pakistan talks after nuclear war threat has come
 kashmir mudde par duniya bhar main apana propaganda bechney main naakaam rahane ke baad videsh mantri shah maumood kuraishi ne kaha ki pakistan ko bharat se dwipaksheeya baatcheet main koi aitraaj nahin he
 Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi has said that Pakistan has never denied talks
 bataa den ki pakistan kaa ye bayaan tab aayaa he jab kuch hi din pehle pakistan ke pradhanmantri imran khan ne kaha tha ki jammu-kashmir se anuchhed-370 khatm kiye jane ke baad ab bharat se koi baatcheet nahin ho sakati he
 Shah Mahmood Qureshi while offering the talks said that Pakistan would be happy if a third party intervenes in it, although he said he did not see any atmosphere of dialogue from India
 kuraishi ne kaha, "philhal bharat dwaara baatcheet kaa koi maahaul nahin dikhataa he
 "shah Mahmood Qureshi said that there are three sides to the Kashmir case
 bharat-pakistan or kashmir
 Qureshi said that to start the dialogue it is necessary that the detained Kashmiri leaders be released
 kuraishi ne baatcheet ke liye ekapaksheeya shart rakhte hue kaha ki unhen kashmiri netritv se milane kii ijaajat di jaae, taaki ve unase baat kar saken or phir kashmiri netritv par baatcheet ke liye dabaav daal saken
 This statement of Shah Mehmood Qureshi is a major change in the foreign policy of Pakistan in recent times
 is bayaan se pehle tak pakistan ke hukmran bharat ke saath saamaanya rishte kii sari sambhaavna khaarij kar chuke the or pratyaksh-apratyaksh rup se parmaanu hamale kii dhamkee de rahe the
 Actually, on the Kashmir issue, Pakistan tried to mislead the world as much as possible
 pakistan duniya ke taqatvar mulkon ke paas gaya, islamic deshon ke sanghathan oisi se guhaar lagaai
 Human rights organizations have told the false story of Jammu and Kashmir, but the world aware of Pakistan's stance and old record not only refused to accept our neighbor's argument, but countries like Russia, France, America and UAE bluntly That the Kashmir issue is bilateral, and there is no need for it to interfere
 iske alaava in deshon ne yah bhi kaha ki anuchhed 370 par liya gaya faisla bharat kaa aantarik maamla he
 After disappointment from many countries and not getting any diplomatic success, Pakistan has offered talks to India
 shuukravaar ko neuyork times main likhe ek lekh main pakistan ke pradhanmantri imran khan ne bhi baatcheet kii ore sanket diya tha
 However, Imran Khan had put conditions for this which would hardly have been accepted by India
 imran ne likhaa tha ki baatcheet ke liye jaruri he ki bharat jammu-kashmir se anuchhed-370 hataane ke faisle par vichaar kare

 desh main raging rokane ke liye jitne bhi prayaas kiye ja rahe hon lekin jamini hakeekat yah he ki abhi bhi raging par puri tarah se lagaam nahin lag pai he
 The comments elahabaad uniwarsity ke ek hostel main chaatro se raging kaa video saamne aayaa he
 Ragging is common with students who live here
 peedit chaatro kaa aarope he ki unke senior unke saath jaanwaron kii tarah bartaav karte hai or unhen gaaliyaan bhi di jaati hai
 In the name of ragging, they are raised overnight and cocked and hung from the ceiling
 is maamle ko lekar chaatro ne police main bhi shikaayat kii lekin police ne abhi tak maamla darj nahin kiya he
 Video of ragging has come out from students in a hostel of Allahabad University
 yahaan rahane gaye chaatro ke saath raging hona aam baat he
 The aggrieved students allege that their seniors treat them like animals and they are also abused
 raging ke naam par unhen raat raatbhar uthaakar murga banaaya jaataa he or chat se latakaaya jaataa he
 The students also complained to the police about the matter but the police have not registered a case yet
 peedit chaatro kaa aarope he ki unke senior unke saath jaanwaron kii tarah bartaav karte hai or unhen gaaliyaan bhi di jaati hai
 In the name of ragging, they are raised overnight and cocked and hung from the ceiling
 is maamle ko lekar chaatro ne police main bhi shikaayat kii lekin police ne abhi tak maamla darj nahin kiya he
 Recession is always bad, long recession is worse
 2018 main saat varsh puure kar rahi mandi ne bharat kii sabase badi aarthik daraar khol di he
 For the first time since 1991, farmers and consumers have stood face to face
 pichley 25 varshon main aisa kabhi nahin hua jab gaanv or shahar is tarah aamane-saamne aae hon
 The biggest success of the economic reforms was that it shrunk the political divide between the village and the city
 sudhaaron ke pehle paanch saal main hi gaanv or shaharon ke bich kii duuri ghatane lagi thi
 The two economies had something to offer each other
 shaharon ke paas badhati aabaadi thi or gaanvon ke paas upaj
 Cities had opportunities, villages had labor
 shaharon ke paas suvidhaayen, sevaayen, takanic thim, gaanvon ke paas unki maang
 Nearly two and a half decades after the reforms, it can be understood today that this change forced governments and politics, to connect villages and cities (road, mobile, electricity) and not to divide
 2006-07 main tej aarthik vikaas ke bich congress ne manaregaa ke jariye gaanvon ko raajnneeti ke centre main laane kii aanshik koshish kii
 MNREGA came in the midst of rapid economic development, so on one hand it increased income in villages and on the other hand industries got new demand
 yahi vah samay tha jab gaanvon main ek nayaa madhya varg taiyaar hua
 Most of the new demand for education, medicine, communication in the last decade has come from this rural and semi-urban middle class
 2007 ke baad gramin or kasbaai bazaar ke liye ranneetiyaan har company kii variyata par thim
 The recent recession distorted this balance
 mandi ne hamen 2011-12 main pakadaa
 In 2014, while changing the government, only a few sectors like e-commerce, stock market, hotels and travel were showing double digit growth
 audyogic utpaadan or bhawan nirmaan thap tha, sevaayen bhi sust pad gai thim
 Nevertheless, between 2008 and 2014, favorable weather, increase in support prices, increasing demand for urban population, better price of land in villages and the rise of agricultural commodities in the international market had kept farming running
 2014 ke sookhe ke baad chaar saal main upaj bigadi or keemten giriin
 There have been small periods of economic slowdown in the last 25 years but this is the first longest period when all the engines of the economy are sluggish or shut down
 sabase badi duvidha2014 main sarkaar ne is sankalp ke saath shuruyaat kii thi ki ab samarthan mulya nahin badhenge kyonki inase mahangaai badhati he
 Political injury and drought on the Land Acquisition Act led to an increase in support prices
 mahangaai ai to daalon ke aayaat se bazaar main keemten tut gayi
 As a result, farmers in Mandsaur received police bullets demanding the price of pulses
 gaanv or shahar ab do dhruvon par khadey hai:kisaan ko apni upaj kaa mulya chahie
 The electoral promise (which was not rational) of 50 per cent profit on yield is a political crisis
 kahaan 2014 main sarkaar samarthan mulyon ko simit kar rahi thi lekin ab haryana main sabji par bhi sarkari keemat dene kii koshish ho rahi he, haalanki vah behad kam he
 Budgets of governments do not allow more than this
 duusari taraf samarthan mulya main koi bhi badhat mahangaai ko daavat he
 The year started with inflation
 tel keemten, bajet ghaataa sab milakar mahangaai ke liye eendhan juta rahe hai
 The risk of inflation will become a political problem in election year amid unemployment in cities and reduction in income
 kisaan or upabhokta ke bich santulan kaa ilaaj khudara bazaar main videshi nivesh or mandi kanoon kii samaapti ho sakati thi lekin vahaan bhaajapa kaa paaramparik vot bank he, jisane donon behad samvedansheel sudhaar paravaan nahin chadhgaye die
 In one of these rebuffs, the GST became head
 pichley do dashak main yah pehla mauka he jab kisaan or upabhokta, donon ek saath pareshaan hai
 Income has decreased in both places and opportunities have decreased
 protsaahan kii choukhat par ab kisaan or upabhokta, donon ko ek saath bithaana asambhav ho chalaa he
 This year's budget will tell whether Prime Minister Narendra Modi will get hold of the tail of the village, electoral stagnation or call politics by consumers
 mandi na chaahate hue bhi gaanv banaam shahar kii vibhaajak siyasat ko chunaav ke centre main le ai he
 There was a lot of uproar last night on the birthday of AAP MLA Rakhi Bidlan from Mangolpuri, Delhi
 beeti raat raakhi bidlaan kaa janmdin tha
 On this occasion, he also got a Scorpio car gift and a party was held in the grand pandal
 is party main raakhi bidlaan or kiraadi ke vidhayak ruturaj ne jamkar dance bhi kiya
 But there was trouble in the battle when behind Rituraj, people of his Legislative Assembly also reached there who had been sitting on a dharna for a few days with a murder
 bataaya jaataa he ki unhen vahaan dekhakar raakhi ke bhai or ruturaj naaraaz ho gaye
 This was followed by a scuffle and rage on both sides
 congress netaa anand sharma ne mangalvaar ko kaha ki beemaa vidheyak kii raah main congress roda nahin paidaa kar rahi he
 The Bill should first be discussed in a Select Committee of Parliament
 purv kendriya vaanijya mantri anand sharma ne sansad se baahar ek samachar channel se kaha, "jab sarkaar ne kal (somavar) ek anaupchaarik baithak bulaai, to us samay sabhi vipakshi partiyaan ekajute thim
 We (congress) are not obstructing it
 " He said, "in a democracy, the government must pay attention to the opposition
 lagbhag sabhi vipakshi partiyon ne is vidheyak se sambandhit kuch na kuch mudde uthaae hai
 It is in the interest of the government to discuss it
 iske liye sabase behatar manch sansad kii pravar samiti he
 " sharma ne bataaya ki is vidheyak ko 2008 main congress ne pesh kiya tha
 He alleged that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had been opposing it for six years
 unhone kaha, "chah saalon tak bhaajapa janata ke hiton ke liye kaam kar rahi thi or ab jab ham unase vidheyak ke kuch mahatvapurn muddon ko spasht karne kii maang kar rahe hai, to hampar janata ke apkaar kaa aarope lagaaya ja rahaa he
 " ullekhneey he ki beemaa kanoon (sanshodhan) vidheyak kaa uddeshy beemaa kshetra main pratyaksh videshi nivesh kii seemaa ko 26 fisadi se badhaakar 49 fisadi karnaa he
 The first budget session of the sixteenth Lok Sabha was concluded on Thursday in which Parliament set a new record of proceedings in the last nearly four years with less disruption and more functioning
 is satr main narendra modi sarkaar kaa pehla aam bajet or rail bajet rakhe jane ke saath mahatvapurn vidheyak paarit kiye gaye or kai jwalanth muddon par charchaa kii gai
 In contrast to the entire winter session of uproar in Parliament in 2010 and only 19 hours and 36 minutes of work during the 2013 budget session, 167 hours were spent in the lower house in this session of the 16th Lok Sabha
 7 july ko shuru hue is satr ke kaamkaaj ke puraa hone par aaj loksabhaa or rajyasabha donon sadanon kii baithken raashtragit vande maataram kii dhun ke saath anischitkaal ke liye sthagit kar di gayi
 Apart from passing the first general budget and railway budget of the bjp-led NDA government, the historic Judicial Appointments Commission Bill and SEBI Bill were passed in this month-long session
 doorsanchaar niamak tri ke purv adhyaksh nripendra mishra ko pradhanmantri kaa pradhan sachiv niyukt kiye jane ke raste main aa rahi kanoonee aadchan ko dur karne ke liye bhi ek mahatvapurn vidheyak ko sansad ne apni manjuuri di
 The Parliament also passed the budget of Delhi where President's rule is presently in force
