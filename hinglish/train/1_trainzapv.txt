 mere khyaal cesiddharthashukla ne jis tarah se aseem ko push kiya he jo laazmi he

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that the Congress President has no moral right to teach the NDA on intolerance and the party should 'bow its head in shame' for the 1984 anti-sikh riots in which thousands of people were slaughtered

 The Congress retaliated by saying that, like the violence after the Godhra incident in 2002, Modi has 'forgotten Rajdharma' in 2015 as he is an advocate of intolerance due to his 'silence' over acts of hate and violence

 The Amarnath Yatra is starting from June 29 this year
 darshan karne waalon kii taadaad badhati ja rahi he or yatra par khatra bhi
 According to the assessment of the Union Home Ministry, violence may increase in the valley after Eid
 yahi kaaran he ki mantralay ne is saal yatra ke liye suraksha balon kii doguni companiyaan tainaat kii hai
 115 companies were deployed last year whereas 210 companies have been deployed this year
 pradhanmantri karyaalay ke rajyamantri jitendra singh ne enditivi india se kaha "amarnath yatra sahi tareeke se nikle yah jimmedaari sarkaar kii to he saath hi samaaj kii bhi he
 This yatra is a symbol of the mixed tradition of the whole of India
 yatra hindu karte hai to unki dekhbhaal duusare dharm ke log
 As far as security is concerned, the Home Minister has taken several meetings and has given additional thrust to the state government
 " tippaniyan The biggest concern is the route of the journey
 yah andeshaa bhi he ki kahin patharbaj hangaamaa na karen
 So far, more than two lakh passengers have been registered for the journey
 mushkil un logon ko lekar he jo achaanak bina registration ke ghati pahunch jate hai
 Meanwhile, Governor NN Vohra, Chairman of the Amarnath Shrine Board, reviewed the security arrangements for the yatra on Friday

 In view of the danger, the ministry has also sent a delegation to Srinagar
 kendriya grih mantralay ke akalan ke mutabik id ke baad ghati main hinsa bad sakati he
 This is the reason why the Ministry has deployed double companies of security forces for the yatra this year
 pichley saal 115 companiyaan tainaat kii gai thim jabaki is saal 210 companiyaan tainaat kii gai hai
 Jitendra Singh, Minister of State for the Prime Minister's Office, told NDTV India, "the responsibility of getting the Amarnath Yatra right is the responsibility of the government as well as the society

 The mlas get a salary of 54000
 bijli pani ke liye maheene kaa chaar hazaar miltaa he
 No government car and house are available
 upi ke ek vidhayak ne bataaya ki unhen 1 lakh rupee se zyada milte hai
 But Congress and BJP have criticized the proposal to increase the salary of mlas
 congress netaa ajay maakan ne kaha he ki ye party ab aam aadmi kii nahin rahi, paanch maheene main inke vidhayak selary badhaane kii baat karne lage hai
 Leader of Opposition in Delhi Legislative Assembly Vijendra Gupta has said that his MLA party will support three mlas if the government brings a proposal for one rupee per month salary
 vijendra gupta ji kii bhaavana kaa sammaan karte hue yah poocha janaa chahie ki ve is mahangaai main ek rupee maheene par kaise ji sakate hai
 What is their source of income
 kya unke paas itnaa paisa he ki bina kamaaye ji sakate hai
 If they tell me this method too, then know for sure that this will be my last prime time
 main somvaar se kaam par nahin aauungaa
 Rather, Vijendra Gupta should be made Finance Minister at the Center with immediate effect
 sirf inhen van rank van pension ke liye bhukh hadtaal par baithe purv sainikon ke maamle kaa prabharee na banaaya jaae varna gupta ji or gadabad kar denge
 Hopefully, Gupta will not mind my words, but if you get this way of living in one rupee, then you audience will also be very good
 agar bijepi ne unki baat maan kar sabhi rajyon main apane vidhayakon kii selary ek rupee kar di to ek mini kranti to ho hi gai samajhiye
 The comments yahi nahin dilli bijepi vidhayak dal ko apana prastaav centre sarkaar ko bhi bhejnaa chahie ki saansadon kaa vetan bhi ek rupaya kar diya jaae
 According to reports, the committee of his party MP Yogi Adityanath has suggested to increase the salary of mps because the work of mps is not going on in three and a half lakh rupees a month
 100 pratishat badhaane kaa prastaav hota he
 Tell me that the MLA in Delhi earns one rupee and MP one lakh, i will not be seen
 meraa kalejaa fata ja rahaa he
 You hold this anchor of your own
 chhodiye aam aadmi party ko, ek rupee ke vetan ke is formule par nobel puraskaar dilavaaiye
 You viewers should also adopt the Vijendra formula of one rupee salary, believe that yoga will not be needed
 van rank van pension kii maang par baithe purv sainikon ko yaad karte hue, unase kshamaa maangate hue ab aapse sawaal karata hum ki kya aap bhi maanate hai ki dilli ke vidhayakon kii selary bahut zyaada he
 No need to increase
 dilli vidhaan sabha main netaa vipaksh vijendra gupta ne kaha he ki agar sarkaar ek rupee maheenaa vetan kaa prastaav laae to teen vidhayakon kaa unka vidhayak dal samarthan karegaa
 While respecting the spirit of Vijendra Gupta, it should be asked how he can live in this inflation for one rupee a month
 unki aay kaa zariyaa kya he
 Do they have enough money to live without earning? agar he to ve yah tarika mujhe bhi bataa den to yakeen jaaniye ye meraa aakhri prime time hoga
 i will not come to work from Monday
 balki vijendra gupta ji ko tatkaal prabhaav se centre main vitt mantri banaaya jaae
 Don't just make them in charge of the ex-servicemen sitting on hunger strike for one rank one pension, else Gupta will mess up
 ummid he gupta ji meri baat kaa bura nahin maanenge lekin ek rupee main jeene kaa yah tarika mil jaae to aap darshakon kaa bhi bahut bhala hoga
 If the BJP obeyed them and paid the salary of their mlas in all the states for one rupee, then a mini revolution has happened
 tippaniyan Not only this, the Delhi BJP Legislature Party should also send its proposal to the Central Government that the salary of mps should also be raised to one rupee
 khabaron ke mutabik unheen ke party ke saansad yogi adityanath kii cameti ne saansadon kii selary badhaane kaa suzav diya he kyonki saansadon kaa kaam saadhe teen lakh rupee maheene main nahin chal rahaa he
 There is a proposal to increase 100 percent
 bataaiye dilli main vidhayak ek rupaya or saansad ek lakh kamaaye mujhase to nahin dekha jayega
 My heart is being torn
 aap apane is ankar ko sambhaaliye
 Leave the Aam Aadmi Party, get a Nobel Prize on this formula of one rupee salary
 aap darshakon ko bhi ek rupee vetan ke vijendra formula ko apana lenaa chahie, yakeen kiijie yoga kii bhi zarurat nahin padegi
 Recalling the ex-servicemen sitting on the demand for One Rank One Pension, apologizing to them, i now ask you whether you also believe that the salary of Delhi mlas is very high
 badhaane kii zarurat nahin he
 Rather, Vijendra Gupta should be made Finance Minister at the Center with immediate effect
 sirf inhen van rank van pension ke liye bhukh hadtaal par baithe purv sainikon ke maamle kaa prabharee na banaaya jaae varna gupta ji or gadabad kar denge

 mukhyamantri ne kaha tha ki punjab ke shahari ilaakon main congress kaa pradarshan acha nahin rahaa or siddhu shahari vikaas mantri hai
 He said that Sidhu made a mistake by making controversial statements
 mantri is baat ko nahin samaj paae ki dharmik granthon kii brudabi ke mudde kii jaanch ke liye vishesh jaanch dal (esaiti) kaa gathan kiya gaya tha
 The Captain has also said that Sidhu's 'yari and Jhappi' from Pakistan's army chief will not be tolerated and especially the army will not tolerate what ISI pro-terrorist targets target
 mukhyamantri ne kaha ki loksabhaa chunaav parinaamon ke pariprekshya main rajya ke mantriyon ke pradarshan kii samiksha kii jaaegi

 But both reel life and real life are completely different from each other
 parde par jo kuch aasaani se ho jaataa he, use asaliyat main karne main kaaphi mashkkat kerani padati he
 Especially if you are trying to impress an Indian girl, then make it a fact that this is a very difficult task
 bhartiya ladakiyonko impress karnaa sabase mushkil hota he lekin in upayon se aap bhartiya ladki ko aasaani se impress kar sakate hai:1
 Indian girls are very impressed by boys who are techno-friendly
 ladkiyaan isse unke smart hone kaa andaja lagaati hai
 They feel that if the frontman is connected with technology then he is one of those who run with time
 wo pichhadaa hua nahin he
 In short, Indian girls love the 'geek' type of boys
 khaastaur par ve jo unki dheron farmaaishon ko bina kahin gaye online hi puraa kar den
 2
 aapako shaayad yakeen na ho lekin bhartiya ladkiyaan ladke main har ek cheez notice karti hai
 She also judges him with the dressing sense of the boy
 aapke kapade kaise hai, aapane juute kis tarah ke pahan rakhe hai or aapane accessories kis tarah kii pahan rakhi he wo sabakuch notice karti hai
 She also pays full attention to shoes
 agar aapane formal ke saath sports shoej pahane hue hai to aapkaa impressant kharaab ho saktaa he or agar aap cajual flip-flop pahanakar gaye hai to apane nakhun saaf karnaa na bhoolen
 3
 agar aap shabdon ke jaadugar hai to ye aapke liye phaayde kii baat ho sakati he
 But it is not like that as soon as you meet the girl, you start giving her a dose of heavy words, but if you can say your words in simple words, then it can be a plus point for you
 4
 If you are physically fit and your personality is attractive then girls get affected quickly
 ladakiyon ko subah ke vakt daud lagane vaale ladke khaas taur par bhaate hai
 But this does not mean that your body should be like a bodybuilder, girls are more fit than a bodybuilder
 5
 It is very important to make the girl realize that you like her very much
 iske liye aap uskaa haath thamkar bhi ye bharosa dilaa sakate hai
 Love can also be expressed by kissing on the hand
 ladkiyaan apane liye shaareerik rup se feet, dimag se smart or pyaar karne vaala ladkaa chaahati hai
 If you have all these qualities, then by presenting them properly you can impress the girl

 Chhath of vows has come
 is din ko maa shashthee or surya kii aradhana ke din ke rup main bhi manaate hai
 This festival is worshiped by the rising sun as well as to receive boons from them
 is din suraj kii kirnon se ghat-ghat par amrit bikhar jayega
 With every arghya, sorrow will go on and all your wishes will be fulfilled
 chhath yani aradhana kaa, mannaten maangane kaa or bhagwaan kii di nematon kaa shukriya adaa karne kaa din hota he
 This is the only festival of worshiping the sun and devotion to Mother Shashthi in which not only the rising sun but also the setting sun is worshiped
 bihar or purvi uttar pradesh ke is sabase bade parv kii taiyaari bhakt diwali ke baad se hi karnaa shuru kar dete hai
 This is also important, it is said that a small mistake made in this puja turns their entire hard work into water
 aise main bhakt apni taraf se devi ko khush karne main koi kasar nahin chhodte
 This festival, which comes on the sixth day of Kartik Shukla, is of four days
 pehle din yani chaturthi ko aatm shuddhi ke liye bhakt keval arava khate hai yani shuddh aahaar lete hai
 After this, devotees recite pooja after bathing on Panchami
 uske baad shaam ko gud or nae chaaval kii khil banaakar fal or mithaiyon se chhathi mata kii puja karte hai
 After this, the devotees accept this Kheel as a Prasad by feeding food to virgin girls and Brahmins
 iske baad aata he sabase ahm din yani shashti, jis din surya kii aradhana hoti he
 On this day, devotees keep fast for the whole day
 maa kii puja ke liye har tarah ke pakwaan banaakar or saat tarah ke fal bans ke daalon main bharkar nadi yaa talab ke kinare jate hai
 Here they burn cane by making sugarcane house and offer it to the setting sun
 ye arghya qamar tak pani main khadey hokar diya jaataa he
 Devotees come home after the sun sets and then awakening occurs
 saptami ke din brahm moohoort main log phir se nadi yaa talab ke tat par ikatthe hote hai or phir ugte hue suraj ko arghya diya jaataa he
 Devotees take the sprouted gram in their hands and listen to the story of Shashthi fast
 katha ke baad prasad vitaran kiya jaataa he or phir sabhi apane-apane ghar laut aate hai
 The fasting people perform this day
 chhath ko mannaton kaa parv bhi kaha jaataa he
 Its importance can be gauged from the fact that there is no room for any mistake in it
 isliye shuddhta or safai ke saath tan or man se bhi is parv main jabardast shuddhta kaa khyaal rakhaa jaataa he
 As much as women keep this festival, men also celebrate this festival with full fervor and enthusiasm
 surya upasna or chhathi maiyaa kii puja ke liye chaar dinon tak chalane vaale is mahaparv kaa itihaas bhi bahut purana he
 There are many stories in the Puranas in which there has been talk of worshiping Suryadev with mother Shashthi, whether it is Lord Rama in Tretayuga or Kunti, the mother of the son Karna like Surya
 chhath puja ko lekar parampara main kai kahaniyaan prachlit hai
 Surya worshiped by Rama, this festival of worship of Surya and Shashti Maa started in Treta Yuga
 bhagwaan ram jab lanka par vijay praapt kar ravan kaa vadh karke ayodhya laute to unhone karthik shukla kii shashthi ko suryadev kii upasna kii or unase aashirwad maanga
 When worshiping Lord Suryadev himself, how could his subjects stay behind
 ram ko dekhakar sabane shashthee kaa vrath rakhana or puja karnaa shuru kar diya
 It is said that from the same day, the devotees celebrate the festival of Shashti i
e
 Chhath
 raja priyavrat kii katharuth puja se judi ek or manyata he, wo ye ki ek baar ek raja priyavrat or unki patni ne santan prapti ke liye putrayeshti yajna karaayaa
 But as soon as their children were born, they left this world and left
 santan kii maut se dukhi priyavrat aatmahatya karne chale gaye to shashti devi ne prakat hokar unhen kaha ki agar tum meri puja karo to tumhen santan kii prapti hogi
 The king worshiped Sasthi Devi, who gave him a son
 kehete hai iske baad se hi chhath puja kii jaati he
 Kunti Karna narrates that when Kunti was a virgin, she invoked Surya to know the truth of sage Durvasa's boon and expressed his son's wish
 kunvaari kunti ko surya ne karn jaisaa parakramee or daanveer putr diya
 There is also a belief that Chhath festival is the name of worship of the sun for the mighty son, just like Karna
 vrath kii shuruyaat nahaay-khaay se hoti he
 Due to some reason the worship material is not tied, therefore houses are cleaned to keep the worship material
 agar pujan saamagree juthi yaa apavitra ho jaae to parv khandit ho jaataa he or ise ashubh mana jaataa he
 From the day of nahay-khay, fasting people sleep on the ground
 ghar main sabhi ke liye satvik bhojan banataa he
 On the second day, after fasting for the whole day, after the moon comes out, the fasting people eat prasad of jaggery kheer
 isi din kaddu kii sabji visheshtaur par khaayi jaati he
 In local parlance it is called pumpkin-bhat
 kaddu-bhaat ke saath hi vratadhariyon kaa 36 ghante kaa akhand vrath shuru ho jaataa he
 During this time, fasters do not take food and water
 tisare din vratadhari ast hote hue surya ko nadi va talab main khadey hokar ardhya dete hai
 On the fourth day, this fast is observed with the sun rising to the sun with tuber-origin and cow's milk
 vratadhari vrath samaapt hone ke baad sabase pehle prasad ke rup thekua khate hai or uske baad ann grahan karte hai
 Mahaparva Chhath of Sun worship is mainly done for the long life of husband and son as well as happiness and prosperity
 is parv main surya kii aradhana kii jaati he
 The rules of Chhath Puja are so strict that before doing this fast, women have to be purified with body and mind and all the things in the house are cleaned
 jo log chhath puja kii saamagree kharidne main asamarth hote hai ve dusron se daan lekar pujan saamagree kharidte hai
 People living in different states and even other countries celebrate this festival with great enthusiasm
 ab yah parv dhire-dhire duusare rajyon main bhi lokapriy ho rahaa he, lekin chaahe koi bhi jagah ho bhakt chhath puja ke niyamon kaa paalan karnaa nahin bhoolatey

 Prabhas's film Saaho from the Baahubali franchise, has been making a tremendous amount at the box office
 opening weekend main saaho ne hindi varjan main 79
 08 crores earned
 haalanki prabhas apni hi film bahubali 2 kaa box offis record nahin tod paae magar saaho kaa ab tak kaa collection shandaar he
 The success of Saaho at the box office so far is also important because the critics have criticized the movie as useless
 zyaadaatar critics ne saaho kii bahut reating kii
 But Prabhas's Jabra fans have no meaning with these reviews
 box offis kamai se itar hokar dekhen to saaho ko soshal media par critics hi nahin kuch aam logon kii bhi aalochana kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 They are asking Prabhas what did he do? Many said that Prabhas's Saho would prove to be the second Race 3 (salman Khan starrer) and Thugs of Hindostan (aamir Khan, Amitabh Bachchan starrer)
 soshal media par daawa kar diya gaya ki ection antertainer saaho kaa hashr bhi salmaan khan kii res-3 or aamir khan kii thags of hindustaan jaisaa hoga
 # Saahosets the BO on 🔥🔥🔥

 - taran adarsh (@taran_adarsh) September 2, 2019 When it comes to the lazy story and screenplay, Saaho is compared to Race 3 and Thugs to a large extent
 
 
 se sambhav he
 But if we look at the box office figures, Saaho's condition does not look like these two films far and wide
 350 karod ke bajet main bani saaho ke mukaable res 3 or thags ko itane bure rivyuu nahin mili the
 But due to Prabhas's fandom and stardom, Saaho is earning remarkably despite the glut of negative reviews
 bhartiya bazaar main res 3 kaa lifetime collection 166
 40 crores and 151 of Thugs of Hindostan
 19 karod tha
 Thugs earned 123 crores in the opening weekend, while Race 3 did a business of 103 crores
 saaho ne sirf hindi varjan main teen dinon main 79
 Has earned 08
 worldwide saaho 2 din main 200 karod kaa aankada paar kar chuki he
 The first week after the opening weekend saw a drop in the earnings of Race-3 and Thugs
 ummid he ki pehle hafte main saaho kii recordtod kamai dekhne ko milegi
 Saaho is released in four languages
 bahubali frenchiji kii vajah se taiyaar hue phens base ne prabhas ko is baar kaaphi had tak ek kamjor film hone ke baavjood bachaa to liya, lekin agali baar shaayad ye phanbes actor ke kaam naa aae
 By the way, it will be interesting to see Saho's box office collection after the weekend

 Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut on Sunday praised the country's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and the Congress Party for honoring parliamentary democracy
 unhone maujuuda paridrishy main 'vipakshi party' ke astitv ko lekar sawaal bhi khadeykie
 He said that the absence of opposition makes the politics of a country arbitrary and unilateral
 shivasena ke mukhpatr 'saamana' main saptahik stambh lekhan main party saansad ne agle maheene prastaavit maharashtra vidhansabha chunaav se pehle sattarudh bhaajapa or shivasena main shaamil hone ke liye qatari main khadey avasarwaadiyon par kataaksh kiya

 unhone kaha, 'marathavada main pani kii kami anuchhed 370 ko hataae jane ke samaan hi mahatvapurn he, lekin koi bhi is vishesh mudde kaa hawala dete hue party nahin chhod rahaa he
 Raut wrote, "even though there is drought everywhere, the leaders of other parties in the BJP and Shiv Sena are in a tizzy
 raajnneeti ek kathin kala he, lekin ab kuch logon ne ise saral bana diya he
 He was apparently referring to the general rant of dal-badlu leaders that they are leaving their original party for the sake of voters and for the development of their constituencies

 It was the Congress that brought some rules related to etiquette and traditions to Parliament after independence

 jab shuru main vipakshi dal kamjor tha, to vah kehete the ki unhen pradhanmantri kii bhoomika nibhaane ke saath-saath vipaksh ke netaa kii bhoomika bhi nibhaani hogi

 Why did the trust between parents and children become weak? That wonder, that sense, that fear, and why that love has become so out of touch? If you really want answers to all these questions, then the parents have to go back a little and find the 'door of trust', which will gradually become weak

 So why is this encroachment allowed? ye vaicharik atikaraman he
 Jaswant Singh made this statement in Jaipur

 On August 19, 2009, Jaswant Singh's eyes were filled with similar in a five-star hotel in Shimla
 us din bhi unhone bijepi ke bare main kuch isi tarah kii baaten kii thim
 He was expelled from the BJP that day
 vajah yah thi ki unhone pakistan ke sansthaapak mohammad ali jinna par likhi kitaab main desh ke vibhaajan ke liye jawahar laal nehru or sardaar vallabh bhai patel par anguli uthaai thi
 In the meeting held at the house of LK Advani after the 2009 defeat, Jaswant Singh demanded action on those responsible for the defeat
 unhone parinaam or puraskaar ke bich sambandh rakhane kaa suzav diya tha
 He was believed to be referring to Arun Jaitley, who was in charge of campaigning in 2009, but after the defeat he was made the Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha

 Party leaders are also reminding Jaswant Singh of his colleague Yashwant Sinha, who this time away from electoral politics by getting his son a ticket from Hazaribagh seat in Jharkhand

 Ideological encroachments have started appearing on the party
 unke samarthak atal bihari vaajapeyi or laalkrishna adwani ke photo ke bich chape narendra modi ke photo ko mitaane lage hai
 There is also an expectation behind the rebellious attitude during the elections, that the internal atmosphere in favor of the party deteriorated due to the internal conflicts within the BJP
 bijepi main kuch log sawaal puch rahe hai ki agar jaswant singh ko barmer se tikat mil jaataa, to bhi vah asli-nakli bijepi kii baat karte
 At the time of the Shimla Chintan meeting, when she was expelled from the BJP and when she returned at the behest of Advani, was she the real BJP or fake? And why did he open his mind about the ideological encroachment on the party only when his ticket was cut?

 There are many changes in human nature after marriage
 uskaa haav-bhav or rahan-sahan achaanak hi badalane lagata he
 We are telling you those 8 changes that are seen in a man after marriage
 hota he jimmedaari kaa ehsaas- rishte nibhaana ek jimmedaari bharaa ehsaas he
 Boys become more responsible after marriage
 unka bachapanaa kam ho jaataa he or ve behad paripakv najar aane lagate hai
 They become aware of their responsibilities and are more concerned with the relationship than before
 motaape kaa ilaaj he alovera, aise karen istemalsikh jaataa he baantnaa-akelaa hona kabhi-kabhi ek sukhad ehsaas detaa he
 During this time, you are the sole owner of the happy moments of life and there is no possibility of any interference in it
 shaadi ke baad aapkaa personal spes pehle kii tarah nahin rah jaataa
 Now you have to share every small and big thing with your wife and family
 yahaan tak ki aapako bathroom bhi share karnaa padataa he
 After marriage, you have to share your time with your wife and then with the children
 soshali hona padataa he active-shaadi keval do logon kaa milan hi nahin balki do pariwaron kaa milan hota he
 After marriage, many relationships - we get connected to which we have to be accountable
 rishte kaaphi najuk hote hai isliye shaadi ke baad inkaa khaas khyaal rakhana padataa he
 However, some people like solitude and are not very socially active
 aise logon ke liye shaadi ke baad yah badi chunauti hoti he
 Learns to care - a man does not care about himself before marriage
 vah apni chizon kaa bhi thik se dhyaan nahin rakhata he
 After marriage, this negligence and carelessness takes the place of responsibility and he also takes care of his spouse
 bananaa padataa he talmail-shaadi ke baad use har rishte ko baraabar samay dena padataa he
 After the arrival of the wife, she has to find time for her parents, siblings as well as other relatives
 isse wo rishton ke bich talmail bananaa sikh jaataa he
 Missed masti-bachelors often like to go to nightout
 wo puri aazaadee se ghoomte-phirte hai or apane doston ke saath masti karte hai
 After marriage, they have to sacrifice their happiness
 unke liye apane life partner ko samay dena unki praathamiktaaon main jud jaataa he
 You have to do with your hobby - Due to increasing responsibilities after marriage, a person has to leave his hobby behind
 job ke saath use apane parivaar ko bhi vakt dena padataa he jiske baad apane shauk-e-sukun ko puraa karne ke liye uske paas vakt nahin rah jaataa
 As soon as the arrival of new Humsafar in the alert-life of the future, a person starts worrying about keeping him satisfied
 uske swasth, uski icchhaaen, uski suraksha ko lekar wo satark ho jaataa he

 When Lord Vishnu wakes up after sleeping for four months on Devauthani Ekadashi of Kartik month, he first marries Tulsi
 bhagwaan vishnu ko tulsi bahut priy hai or keval tulsi dal arpit karke srihari ko prasann kiya ja saktaa he
 Those who conduct Tulsi marriages get marital happiness
 rakshas kanya vrinda ko die ek aashirwad ke anusaar, bhagwaan vishnu ne vrinda se vivaah karne ke liye shaligram ke avatar main janm liya

 isiilie har saal prabodhini ekadshi ko tulsi puja kii jaati he
 Know further, how Tulsi became a demon girl named Vrinda and how Tulsi married Vishnu

 Vrinda was married to a demon named Jalandhar, born of Samudra Manthan
 vrinda bhagwaan vishnu kii bhakt ke saath ek pativrata stri thi jiske kaaran uskaa pati jalandhar or bhi shaktishaalee ho gaya
 Even Mahadev, the god of the gods, could not defeat Jalandhar
 bhagwaan shiv samet devataaon ne jalandhar kaa naash karne ke liye bhagwaan vishnu se prarthani kii
 Lord Vishnu disguised as Jalandhar and destroyed the sanctity of the bride Vrinda
 jab vrinda kii pavitrataa khatm ho gai to jalandhar kii takat khatm ho gai or bhagwaan shiv ne jalandhar ko maar diya
 When Vrinda came to know about the Maya of Lord Vishnu, she became enraged and cursed Lord Vishnu to become a black stone (shaligram stone)
 vrinda ne bhagwaan vishnu ko shraap diya ki vah apni patni se alag ho jaaenge
 Lord Sita is separated from Mother in the incarnation of Rama
 bhagwaan ko pathar kaa hote dekh sabhi devi-devtaa main hakaakar much gaya, phir mata lakshmi ne vrinda se prarthana kii tab vrinda ne jagat kalyaan ke liye apana shraap waapas le liya or khud jalandhar ke saath sati ho gai
 Then a plant came out of their ashes which Lord Vishnu named Tulsi and encapsulated a form of himself, saying that from today i will not accept Prasad without Tulsi
 is pathar ko shaligram ke naam se tulsi ji ke saath hi puja jaayegaa
 Tulsi ji is also married to Shaligram in Kartik month
 jo log tulsi vivaah sampann karaate hai, unako vaivaahik sukh miltaa he
 Tulsi marriage does not happen only on Devotthan Ekadashi

 The anti-incumbency wave has been seen in most of the states where assembly elections have been held after the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 karnataka vidhansabha chunaav main siddharmaiya kii haar bhi isi trend kaa nateeja he
 Such anti-incumbency can also be seen in the states where assembly elections are to be held before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 bataa den ki pichley loksabhaa chunaav main manmohan singh ke netritv vaali upie sarkaar ke khilaaf jabardast satta virdohi lahar dekhne ko mili thi
 Due to various scams including 2G spectrum, coal block allocation and Commonwealth Games, people voted against Manmohan Singh and under the leadership of Narendra Modi, BJP was handed over the power of the country
 loksabhaa chunaav ke baad pehla vidhansabha chunaav dilli main hua
 Out of 70 assembly seats in the state, the Aam Aadmi Party got 67 seats
 dilli kaa janadesh bijepi or congress donon ke khilaaf chalaa gaya
 The Congress could not even open an account in Delhi elections
 desh ke jin rajyon main sattarudh dal ke khilaaf janadesh gaya, unamem aadhikansh rajyon main congress satta par kabiz thi
 In such a situation, the Grand Old Party has to face the anti-incumbency
 isi ke chalate congress ko kai rajyon main apni satta ganvaani padi he
 At the same time, BJP has also faced such apprehension
 maharashtra, haryana, assam,andhra pradesh, uttarakhand or himachal pradesh main vidhansabha chunaav hue hai
 All these states had Congress governments and had to face anti-incumbency
 karnataka chunaav main bhi yahi hua
 One by one the power of the state was slipped from the hands of the Congress
 andhra pradesh main tidipi ne congress or wiesar congress ko haraakar satta hasil kii
 In all other states, BJP came as the winner
 andhra pradesh main bijepi kaa koi vaastavik aadhaar nahin he, do maheene pehle tak wo tidipi ke saath thi, lekin ab donon kii raah alag-alag he
 Naveen Patnaik-led BJD in Odisha and Mamta Banerjee Trinamool in West Bengal buoyed the trend
 haalanki ye apwaad he
 In the 2015 assembly elections, Nitish Kumar managed to preserve his power in Bihar by tying up with Lalu's party RJD
 aisa hi trend rahaa to phir rajasthan main bijepi ko satta virdohi lahar kaa saamana karnaa padega
 The BJP has faced dissatisfaction in Gujarat for 22 years
 haalanki, bijepi apni satta ko bachaane main safal rahi, lekin pehali baar bijepi 100 ke aankade neeche aa gai or bahumat se mahaj saat siten zyada mili
 BJP is also facing a tough challenge in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, Congress will be in front in both the states
 rajasthan, madhya pradesh or chhattisgarh main donon partiyon ke bich sidhaa muqabla hoga
 Similarly, the congress-jmm alliance in Jharkhand can create problems for the BJP in the next assembly elections
 haalanki bijepi rashtriya str par sabase majboot party he or narendra modi sabase lokapriy netaa maane ja rahe hai
 If the trend of anti-incumbency continues, then it will not be easy for the ruling party to win in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 basharte vipaksh sanyukt hokar maidan main utre
 Not only this, if the opposition parties adopt a pragmatic attitude by removing mutual differences, then it can be difficult for the ruling BJP
 vipaksh ko ummid he ki bijepi 20 rajyon kii satta main kabiz he or 2019 main kai rajyon main satta virdohi lahar hogi, jisase loksabhaa chunaavon main vipaksh ko madad mil sakati he

 ) The Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) on the 2-G scam is set to give a clean chit to PM Manmohan Singh and p Chidambaram
 isamen sabhi gadabadiyon ke liye tab ke telecom mantri e raja ko doshi tehraae jane kii baat saamne ai he
 These information came out of the draft report, which has been distributed to its members by the JPC headed by Congress leader PC Chacko
 is par raajnneeti garma gai he
 The BJP and the Left have decided to bring a dissent motion against it
 darasal, bijepi pradhanmantri ko clin chit die jane se naaraaz he
 BJP leader and committee member Yashwant Sinha accused committee chairman PC Chacko that Chacko put morality on hold to save PM and Chidambaram
 duusari taraf left ne sawaal uthaaya he ki piem or raja ko jepisi main kyon nahin bulaayaa gaya
 CPI leader Gurudas Das Gupta said that the report was a surprise and now the committee chairman PC Chacko will have to answer many questions on it
 bijepi or left donon is mudde ko sansad main jorshor se uthaane kii taiyaari main hai
 Dasgupta said, we will dismiss it
 ham apane vichaar denge
 This is an attempt to cover the matter
 yah congress party ke ishaare par gadhi gai kahani he
 JPC member Dasgupta said that this is contradictory to the facts revealed
 bhaajapa pravaktaa minakshi lekhi ne kaha, chunki ham jepisi kaa hissaa the, ham apane vichaar rakhenge taaki yah bhavishya ke liye on record aa jaae
 This will preserve history, as the report is for future generations
 lekhi ne jepisi kii maang karte samay party ke rukh ko yah kehete hue sahi tehraaya, prashasan kii vyavastha main yakeen rakhane vaali ek party ke taur par ham un pranaaliyon kii andekhi nahin kar sakate jinhen sthapit kiya gaya he
 The BJP spokesperson said, "we thought that they would be people working for the country, not looking like a member of a political party and keeping a vision like a politician
" lekin aisa nahin hua he
 CPI leader d Raja said, it has remained as a Congress report
 meri party ek asantosh patr degi, kyonki ham isse sahamat nahin hai
 Raja also criticized the leaking of the report, saying it is not acceptable to us at all
 yah ab bhi ek masauda report he
 jpc's formal meeting is still to be held
 report ko aupchaarik taur par sweekaar kiya janaa baaki he
 The CPI leader also said that this was a clear attempt to "save the Prime Minister and the then Finance Minister"
 vahiin dramuk ne e raja ko 2ji maamle main sanyukt sansadeey samiti (jepisi) ke samaksh apana paksh rakhane kii ijaajat dene kii apni maang phir uthaate hue kaha ki in aaropon par raja ko spashtikaran dene kii ijaajat nahin milane kii surat main samiti kii report ‘‘bekaar’’ rah jaaegi
 The DMK said that "wrong allegations" have been leveled against their leader
 party ke saansad tii ke es ellengoan ne kaha ki raja ko bulaaye bina yah galat aarope hai, jinka koi matlab nahin he
 The comments vaise, is report ko sadan main paas karwaane ke liye bhi sarkaar ko bahut mashkkat kerani hogi
 The JPC consists of 30 members including the Speaker, of which 20 are members of the Lok Sabha and 10 of the Rajya Sabha
 agar sarkaar ko report par samaajawaadee party or bahujan samaaj party kaa samarthan miltaa he to sarkaar ke saath cameti ke 14 sadsy honge jabaki sarkaar ke khilaaf 16 sadsy honge
 The government will need some more members to get the report approved in the House, for which the central government will have to convince parties like Trinamool Congress or Janata Dal United
 agar inamen se kisi party ke sadsy gaiyr-maujuud rahe to sarkaar kaa kaam ho jayega yani sarkaar ke managers ko is number game main apane aankadon ko chaturaai se manage karnaa hoga
 Experts believe that the JPC report will have the same condition as the PAC report
 bijepi or left ne iske khilaaf asahmati prastaav laane kaa faisla kiya he
 Actually, the BJP is angry at the Prime Minister being given a clean chit
 bijepi netaa or samiti ke sadsy yashavanth sinha ne cameti ke adhyaksh pisi chaako par aarope lagaate hue kaha ki piem or chidambaram ko bachaane ke liye chaako ne naitikta taak par rakh di
 On the other hand, the Left has questioned why PM and Raja were not invited to JPC
 sipiai netaa gurudas das gupta ne kaha ki yah report lipapoti he or ab is par cameti ke adhyaksh pisi chaako ko kai sawaalon kaa jawaab dena hoga
 Both the BJP and the Left are preparing to raise the issue vigorously in Parliament
 dasgupta ne kaha, ham ise khaarij karenge
 We will give our views
 yah maamle par pardaa daalane kii koshish he
 This is a story made at the behest of the Congress party
 jepisi ke sadsy dasgupta ne kaha ki yah saamne aae tathyon ke virodhabhasi he 
 BJP spokesperson Meenakshi Lekhi said, since we were part of the JPC, we will keep our views so that it comes on record for the future
 isse itihaas kaayam hoga, kyonki report bhavi peedi ke liye hoti he
 Lekhi, while demanding the JPC, justified the party's stance by saying, as a party that believes in the system of administration, we cannot ignore the systems that have been established
 bhaajapa pravaktaa ne kaha, hamane sochaa tha ki ve desh ke liye kaam karne vaale log honge, ek raajnneetik dal ke sadsy kii tarah na dekhakar ek rajaneta kii tarah kii drushti rakhenge
 But this has not happened
 bhakpa netaa di raja ne kaha, yah ek congress report banakar rah gai he
 My party will give a dissent letter because we do not agree with it
 raja ne report ke li hone kii bhi yah kehete hue aalochana kii, yah hamen bilkul sweekaarya nahin he
 It is still a draft report

 BJP sources are quoted as saying that Ramkripal will join the party on Tuesday
 in sabake bich, argedy supremeo lalu prasad yadav ne saaf kiya he ki unhone ramkripal ko party chhodkar jane ko nahin kaha he
 But if they want to go, they will not be stopped
 lalu yadav ne kaha, 'maine kabhi bhi ramkripal ko party chhodane ko nahin kaha
 But if a party chooses to leave, it cannot be stopped
 jin ummidavaaron ke naam kaa elaan ho gaya unhen nahin badla jayega
 'it is noteworthy that Ramkripal Yadav resigned from all the posts of RJD on 8 March
 haalanki unhone party nahin chodi thi
 After which the RJD spoke of not recommending the cancellation of his Rajya Sabha membership
 kya he puri kahaneelalu yadav ne 6 march ko party ke loksabhaa ummidavaaron kii ghoshnaa kii
 The list included his wife Rabri Devi and daughter Misa Bharti, but Ramkripal Yadav was absent
 misa ko patliputra seat se tikat diya gaya tha, jahaan ramkripal khud chunaav ladanaa chaahate the
 He got angry and took a rebellious attitude
 agle din, 'chachaa' ramkripal ko manaane misa bharti khud pahunchin
 He said that he is ready to give up Pataliputra seat for senior party leader
 phir shaam tak khabar ai ki ramkripal yadav maan gaye hai
 It seemed that the matter was resolved, but the twist came when Lalu Yadav gave the statement that horses are not changed in the middle race
 iske baad 8 march ko ramkripal yadav ne party ke sabhi padon se istipha kaa elaan kar diya
 He alleged that RJD and Misa Bharti committed emotional torture with him
 unke ghar par misa kaa aana mahaj raajnneetik nautanki thi
 To which Misa Bharti retorted that if a niece goes to convince her uncle, that too is emotional atrocity, what should i say? salmaan khan kii film 'bajrangi bhaijan' ek ke baad ek record todatii hui ab bollywood kii ab tak kii sabase zyada kamai karne vaali filmon main duusare number par pahunch gai he

 unhone indore main 43 gend main shatak banaaya or apane gharelu maidan par vah is form ko barkaraar rakhana chahenge
 The batting of the Indian team has been excellent in both the matches
 lokesh rahul ne donon maichon main ardhashatak jade hai, jabaki rohit ne pichley match main tufaani shatkeey pari kheli thi
 The weight of the batting will be on the shoulders of both of them
 in donon ko team ke purv captain mahendra singh dhoni, hardik pandya, manish pandey, dinesh karthik or shreyas ayyar se acha samarthan milegaa
 Dhoni has also made significant contributions with the bat in both the matches
 vahiin gendbaaji main bharat kii takat kuldeep yadav or yujavendra chahal he
 Both of them have not let the Sri Lankan batsmen stick to the wickets in odis and T20 series
 duusare match main bhi jab srilankai ballebaaj ranon kii barsaat kar rahe the, tabhi in donon ne srilankai team ke lagaataar wicket lekar use roak diya tha
 Jasprit Bumrah will have a load in fast bowling

 He did not come out to bat in the second match

 Islamic extremists from Nigeria's terrorist organization Boko Haram have found a new leader of their own, who are threatening to stop attacks on mosques and markets of common Muslims and to carry out bomb attacks on churches and kill Christians

 ) Comedy King Kapil Sharma has created a ruckus in the political world by accusing the Bombay Municipality of demanding a bribe of Rs 5 lakh
 bayaan par bijepi or shivasena jahaan jang ke mood main he, vahiin shaam dhalate-dhalate hi sharma ne is ore safai di he
 Kapil Sharma has tweeted that he is only talking about corruption and his statement is not against any political party
 kapil sharma ne apane taaja twit main kaha he, 'maine sirf us bhrashtachar ke khilaaf aawaaj uthaai he, jiskaa maine saamana kiya he
 i am not blaming BJP, MNS, Shiv Sena or any political party for this
 'bataa den ki netaaon ke alaava biemasi ne bhikapil par avaidh nirmanka aarope lagaakar palatwaar kiya he
 Earlier, standup comedian Kapil Sharma, who brought pain to the audience with his cool comedy on the small screen, made such a big blast on Twitter in the morning, which has been increasing with the passage of time
 emenes ne kapil ko maafee maangane ko kaha or dhamkee di he ki vah unke sho kii shooting nahin hone denge, vahiin shivasena ne kaha ki sharma par gunda act ke tahat karrwai honi chahie
 i just voiced my concern on the corruption i faced with certain individuals
 
 Its no blame on any political party be it BJP, MNS or shivsena — KAPIL (@ kapilsharmak9) September 9, 2016in a series of tweets, Kapil tweeted, 'I have been paying Rs 15 crore tax for the last five years
 i am iske baavjood apana offis banane ke liye mujhe biemasi ko 5 lakh kii ghoose deni hogi
 Later, he tweeted another tweet to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, 'are these good days?' BMC immediately swung into action after Kapil Sharma's tweet to PM
 adhikariyon ne kapil se poocha ki vah 5 lakh rishwat maangane vaale kaa naam bataaen
 However, the twist in the case came when Kapil himself was seen surrounded by BMC allegations

 The Greater Mumbai Municipal Corporation, taking cognizance of Kapil's complaint, has sent a notice to him and assured that the matter will be investigated and action taken

 Now look at something like this, one of the 32 people accused in the June violence and arson case in Mandsaur, who is handicapped and cannot get up from bed for the last six years
 vidhansabha main shuukravaar ko charchaa ke dauraan congress vidhayak ramanivas ravat ne apahiz ko aaropee banaakar paanch hajaar rupee kaa inaam ghoshit kiye jane kaa masalaa uthaaya
 He said that in the case of firing on the farmers in Mandsaur on June 6, the police has issued a list of 32 people for finding the accused and has announced a reward of five thousand rupees
 ravat ne is suchi main ek apahiz kaa bhi naam hone kaa aarope lagaaya
 He said, "nanuram's son Badrilal is handicapped and has been bedridden since 2011 and cannot even walk
 use bhi police ne aaropee bana diya he
 "during the peasants' agitation in the state from June 2 to June 10, 6 farmers were killed by police bullets and sticks in Komandsaur on June 6
 is dauraan aagjanee bhi hui thi
 There are 32 names in the list of people involved in police and other incidents of violence

 But Mulayam is not satisfied, the leaders seated on the other side of the room are prompted, one by one, all give feedback of the riots to Mulayam
 adhikariyon ke ravaiye se zyaadaatar netaa naaraazgi jaahir karte hai
 Mulayam Singh also agrees on the opinion of the leaders
 ve mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ko doshi adhikariyon ko chinhit kar un par sakhya karrwai karne kaa aadesh dete hai
 The meeting ended two hours later
 agle din subah 10 baje phir mulaayam, akhilesh or adhikariyon ke saath meeting karte hai
 The Chief Minister gives information about the officers who failed to stop the riot and at the end of the meeting, orders to remove the DIG, Commissioner of Saharanpur, SSP of Muzaffarnagar and SSP of Shamli are issued
 teen maheene pehle 4 june ko vikramaditya maarg par sapa ke pradesh mukhyalay main yojit ek kaarykram ke dauraan mukhyamantri kii maujuudagi main mulaayam singh yadav ne soobe kii bigadi kanoon vyavastha ke bare main kaha tha, ''yadi main mukhyamantri hota to 15 din ke bheetar soobe kii kanoon vyavastha thik kar detaa
 Finally, Mulayam had to play the role of Chief Minister to deal with the communal riots in Muzaffarnagar
 pichley varsh sapa kii sarkaar banane ke baad yah pehla mauka tha jab netaji ne is tarah apane awaas par mukhyamantri or sheersh prashasnic adhikariyon ke saath meeting kii
 Mulayam's interference in administrative work made it clear that the hopes with which he had placed his son Akhilesh on the throne of the country's largest state have faded
 shuru main yah kaha ja rahaa tha ki akhilesh abhi nae hai or unhen mauka diya janaa chahie lekin lagaataar bigadati kanoon-vyavastha or ek ke baad ek dangon ne mukhyamantri ke rup main akhilesh yadav kii prashasnic kshamta par sawaal khadey kar die hai
 The National Highway 58 in the northeast direction from the anti-akhilesh swaradilli within the SP divides Muzaffarnagar in Uttar Pradesh into two geographical and ironic halves — Muslim on the left and Hindu settlements on the right
 shahar kii jin sadakon par hardam chahal-pahal rahati thi, or tractor par aate-jate gud kii khushboo mahakaa karti thi vahaan 10 sitambar ko maut kaa sannata pasra tha

 Within a year and a half, Akhilesh Yadav has not been able to show the change in UP in which people had installed his party with a huge majority
 meerut vishvavidhyalay ke arthshaastra vibhaag main reader dow
 Manoj Siwach explains that Akhilesh Yadav's inexperience is coming in the way of working as Chief Minister
 isi vajah se ve prashasnic mashinari par apni pakad nahin bana paae hai
 Sivach says, "at the top of the SP government are close administrative officers close to Mulayam Singh
 in adhikariyon kii jimmedaari to mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ke prati he lekin ye adhikari apni javabdehi ab bhi mulaayam singh ke prati maanate hai
 This is the reason that Akhilesh has not been able to establish his Iqbal among these officials
 ” isaki vajah se kisi bhi mudde par adhikari us tarah hi sakriyata nahin dikhaate jaisi ek mukhyamantri ke saamne unase apeksha kii jaati he
 One of the major reasons for not being able to control the riots in Muzaffarnagar is the sluggish and irresponsible attitude of the officials
 prashasan kaa adoordarshee kadammujaffarnagar main janasth ke kawal main 27 agast ko hui teen logon kii hatya ke baad shashan ne ek adoordarshee kadam uthaate hue turant dm surendra singh or esaspi manzil saini ko hataa diya lekin nae dm kaushalraj sharma or esaspi subhash chandra dube ekaek puure maamle ko sahi tarah se nahin samaj paae
 On September 7, Director General of Police (DGP) Devraj Nagar reached Muzaffarnagar a day before to control the situation created by the announcement of the panchayat in Nangla Mandore area
 isi din nagar ne adhikariyon or ilaake ke prabudgh logon ke saath baithak main yah mana ki sampradayik tanaav gaanvon main fail rahaa he
 The police exerted their full power in handling the panchayat of Nangla Mandore but the DGP, despite expressing apprehension, did not make any concrete arrangements to prevent the spark of communal tension in the countryside from becoming Shola
 yahi nahin, khufia vibhaag bhi panchayat ke baad hui hinsa kii thaah paane main puri tarah asafal rahaa
 Chandrabhan Singh, a lawyer in the Muzaffarnagar District Court, says that even after the DGP said, the local intelligence failed to detect the chinagari in the villages in protest against the panchayat
 singh bataate hai, ''police kaa sara dhyaan panchayat sthal par hi tha
 "when there were attacks on the people returning from the panchayat, there were no policemen in the villages
" asal main police mahakme ke saare aalaa adhikariyon kii maujuudagi ke baavjood gaanvon main danga failane se rokane kaa koi plan banaaya hi nahin gaya tha
 As violence spread in the villages, it spread like a forest fire and the police acted as mere spectacle
 apper police mahanideshak (kanoon evam vyavastha) arun kumaar sweekaar karte hai ki nae prashasnic adhikariyon se kuch chook hui thi jisase sthiti bighad gai
 The rumors turned communal tensions into violence, especially in villages
 police mukhyalay main iji str ke ek adhikari bataate hai ki intelligence or sthaneey prashasan kii naakaami ke chalate 7 sitambar kii panchayat ke baad achaanak danga bhadak uthaa
 When this spark reached Shamli, the government had no option but to call the army within 24 hours
 maaya ke afasaron par lagaaya daanvsena bulaane ke baad bhi jab mujffarnagar, shamali or badot main dangon kii chinagaari nahin buji to mukhyamantri akhilesh ne un afasaron par daanv lagaaya jinhone mayawati ke kaarykaal ke dauraan pradesh main kahin bhi danga nahin hone diya tha
 He decided to try his experience in the riot-stricken area in 2008 by sending Vijay Bhushan, a special IPS officer of the previous Mayawati government to control communal tension in Ghaziabad in time
 bispi sarkaar ke dauraan estf ke esaspi rahe amit pathak ko bhi dangagrast ilaake main bheja gaya
 Rajiv Sabharwal, who was the DIG of STF in the previous government, is considered an expert in using technology to deal with rioters

 There was not a single communal tension in Meerut during his tenure
 danga niyantran main chandraprakash ke anubhav kaa bhi laabh lene kaa nirnay liya gaya
 BSP state spokesperson and Leader of Opposition Swami Prasad Maurya says, "UP officials are in a dilemma whether to listen to Mulayam Singh or Akhilesh Yadav
 vaise bhi is sarkaar main saadhe paanch mukhyamantri hai
 "what is happening in Muzaffarnagar is actually the most barbaric form of the growing vicious cycle at the political level
" do dashak pehle sampradayik vibhaajan kii jo rekhaaen gaayab ho chuki thim unhen phir se khinchaa ja rahaa he or rajnatik dal behad sampradayik hokar agle aam chunaav se pehle apana-apana paksh majboot karne main jute hai
 Seeing the possibility of no one getting a clear victory in this election, the leaders are trying to cement their main vote bank by adopting the most perverse gimmick of Indian politics - the division of communities
 dobaaraa ho rahi is golbandi ke saboot chaaron taraf bikhare hai
 In 2013, there were clashes from Assam to Rajasthan and from Jammu and Kashmir to Tamil Nadu
 inamen se harek danga kisi-na-kisi maamuli baat se bhadkaa he
 This tragic event could have taken the form of a family war or a battle between neighborhoods
 lekin donon taraf ke netaaon ne nafrat kii raajnneeti ke jariye apana-apana aadhaar majboot karne kaa mauka tada or unke ishaare par is ghatana ne sampradayik dange kaa rup le liya
 The violence in Muzaffarnagar has completely shaken the jat-muslim alliance in the western districts
 khaas baat yah he ki in jilon ke gramin ilaakon main jat or muslim bastiyaan ek duusare se is kadar ghuli-mili hai ki donon ke bich vibhaajan kii rekha kheenchna kisi bhi rajnatik party ke liye sambhav nahin tha
 This created a jitu-muslim equation in the western districts of UP
 lokdal (areldi) ke sansthaapak or purv pradhanmantri choudhary charan singh ko isi gathjod ne rajnatik khadpaani muhaiyaa karya
 Later, even after increasing the influence of SP and BSP, the jat-muslim alliance did not stop and the leaders of all parties Hukum Singh, Harendra Malik, Amir Alam, Qadir Rana, Sanjay Chauhan, Dharamvir Ballian, Anuradha Chaudhary, Rajpal Baliyan formed this Jitau alliance
 Achieved success mujffarnagar ke dangon ke baad yah pehla mauka he ki jat or muslim aamane-saamne khadey hai
 The splitting between Jats and Muslims has created a crisis in front of the RLD, which holds the maximum in these areas
 is bantwaare ne jat or musalamaanon ke bich dhruvikaran kii rajnatik sambhaavna ke dwaar khol die hai jisamen sabase zyada phaayde main philhal bijepi dikhaai de rahi he

 However, BSP national president Mayawati points towards the collusion between SP and BJP behind these riots
 mayawati upi main raashtrapati shashan kii maang kar chuki hai
 Questions raised on Muslim appeasement, after the ban on governance, on September 7 in the grounds of Panchayat and violence in the grounds of Nangla Mandour Inter College, BJP MLA from Bijnor Bharatendra, MLA from Thanabhavan Suresh Rana, former MP Sohanbir Singh, former Congress MP Harendra Malik and Nominated reports were filed against 16 people, including senior BJP leader Yashpal Panwar

 The SP government's action to file cases against big opposition leaders in western districts has also given a chance to political parties
 bijepi, bispi or congress prashasan kii is karrwai ke virodh main andolan kii ruparekha tay kar rahi hai
 These parties complain that the administration has filed a case against their leaders as a mere pressure tactic
 bijepi ke pradesh adhyaksh lakshmikant bajpeyi ke netritv main ek pratinidhimandal ne 10 sitambar ko rajyapal se milakar sapa sarkaar par ek paksheeya karrwai karne kaa aarope lagaaya
 On September 9, when Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav reached the Haj Manzil in Lucknow to leave the first batch of Haj pilgrims along with Urban Development Minister Azam Khan, he put on a Muslim cap, which also went to Khan (see talk, "from the riots" Two days ago said curfew ”)
 lekin mujffarnagar main hinsa kii aag ke bich is dikhaave se yah sandesh gaya ki sapa muslim samarthakon ko nahin chhodeygi
 The Akhilesh government probably has the longest list of concessions for Muslims
 rajya sarkaar kii sabhi 85 kalyaan yojanaon main musalamaanon ke liye 20 pratishat aarakshan he
 On 28 July, the party also tried to describe the suspension of IAS officer Durga Shakti Nagpal as a Muslim beneficial decision
 usne aarope lagaaya ki nagpal ne greater noida main sarkari jameen par ban rahi masjid kii diwaar giraane kaa aadesh diya tha
 On the other hand, Muslim organizations believe that there is no welfare of Muslims under Akhilesh's rule
 pashchimi uttar pradesh main danga bhadakne se pehle hi kai sanghathanon ne ilaake main sampradayikta or tanaav badaae kaa andeshaa jataayaa tha
 Following the riots, Jamiat Ulema-e Hind, jamate-islami, All India Muslim Majlis Masewarat, Jamiat Ahlehadis and All India Muslim Personal Board demanded the Prime Minister to sack the Akhilesh government

 inamen aisi chijen maujuud hai jo aapke dil ko auraliverko biimaar kar sakati hai
 CSE i
e
 Center for Science and Environment has revealed this sensational
 siesai ke mutabis chips, burgers, aalu bhujiyaa or french frai jaise junk food ko lekar jo adhyayan kiye gaye, usamen behad chaunkaane vaale khulaase hue
 It was revealed that the amount of trans fat in the junk food of all the companies present in the market is more than necessary
 itnaa hi nahin trans fat ke alaava junk food main chini or namak kii maatra bhi zarurat se zyada he
 CSE claims that all companies are giving false information about junk food
 companikaan apane raper par jiro transfat likhti hai, jabaki trans fat maujuud hota he
 According to cse's claim, if the amount of trans fat present in junk food is more than necessary, then it is not good news for us and you because trans fat is very dangerous for our health
 siesai ke mutabik jankafood banane vaali takreeban sabhi khadyakampaniyon ke daawey jhuthe paae gaye
 Companies say there is something else and there is something else found in foods
 jiro transfat ke daawey to saraasar jhuthe hai
 On the other hand, the rules regarding junk food are very loose instead of strict
 siesai ke adhyan ke mutabik bazaar main maujuud sari nami companiyon ke junk food main trans fat or namak kii maatra zyada he
 So they are knocking many diseases
 junk food se saavdhaan rahanaa jaruri he, kyonki agar siesai ke daawey sahi hai to inamen aisi cheez maujuud he jo ham sabko dhire dhire biimaar kar rahi he or beemaari bhi aisi jo sidhe maut ke munh main dhakel sakati he
 According to the CSE claim, there is more trans fat than all the well-known companies present in the market
 ek khaas tarah kaa vasa he trans fat jo kudarti rup se nahin paaya jaataa, balki ise kritrim rup se banaaya jaataa he
 When mixed with hydrogen in vegetable oil, it becomes trans fat when solidified
 trans fat bananaa sasta hota lihaaja companiyaan iskaa istemaal dhadlle se karti hai
 Also, the product can be given special flavor by its use
 trans fat hamaare sharir main cholestaural badhaata he jisaki vajah se coronary heart digis yani dil kii beemaari kaa khatra bad jaataa he
 Not only this, excessive use of trans fat also causes diseases like hypertension
 trans fat hamaare liver par bhi asar daalata he or dhire dhire liver ko biimaar karata jaataa he
 It does not end here, trans fat can also make impotent
 agar siesai ke daavon main dam he or vaaki bazaar main beche ja rahe junk food main trans fat kii maatra zarurat se zyada he to ye hamaare or aapke liye to khatre kii ghanti he hi, hamaari nai peedi ke liye behad khatarnaak he
