 unke coment ke baad logon ne twitor par tarah-tarah ke riection die or sanjay raut ko trol karne kii koshish kii
 Why just chicken and eggs? Mutton and Beef should be added to the list too
 Vedic sacrifices and havans always had offerings of them
 Even horse meat was offered
 # ashwamedhyagya Besides they all eat plants and seeds, which are vegetarian without a doubt
 Yahi baaki reh gaya ta abbut here's the question: Can these newly vegetarain foods be cooked with # onion and # garlic? Or would that be a step too far
 Matlab ab veg biryani mein bhi leg piece mumkin hai
 Wow! Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut on Monday demanded in the House that chickens and eggs be kept in the category of vegetarian

 He said that it is an Ayurvedic chicken
 adivasee ne kaha ki yah ek aisi murgi he, jiskaa ham is tarah se paalan-poshan karte hai, ki aapke sharir ke sab rog baahar nikal jaaenge
 It is a subject of research for the Ministry of AYUSH
 'shivasena netaa ne kaha ki haryana kii choudhary charan singh agriculture uniwarsity se kuch din pehle unke paas kuch log aae

 The egg it produces is completely vegetarian

 Vegetarianism and non-vegetarianism are a big controversy in this country
 sanjay raut ne kaha ki vishwa main pradhanmantri modi ji hamaare ayurveda or yoga ke sabase bade ambesder ho gaye hai
 There is yoga all over the world, there is Ayurveda all over the world, so instead of 1500 crore rupees the Ministry of AYUSH should have a budget of at least 10 thousand crores
 ayurveda kii tarif karte hue raut ne kaha ki aapako maaloom he ki ham ayurveda kaa darwaja kab khatkhataate hai? jab sab darvaaze band ho jate hai

 supreme court ne companiyon ko fatkaar lagaai thi
 The Supreme Court said that you do not respect the law of the country
 aap ye nahin kah sakate ki is maamle main aap kuch nahin kar sakate
 The central government finds a way out on this issue

 The court also ordered the Center to set up a nodal agency to file complaints about such advertisements
 yah agency shikayaton ko search injanon ko degi or phir search ingine aisi soochnaaon or vigyapanon ko 36 ghante main hataayenge
 The final hearing on the case will be held on February 17, in which the Supreme Court will also decide whether this ban is a violation of the right to information

 Yogendra, in a Facebook post, narrating all the qualities of Shri Krishna, said that among the thirty three crore Gods and Goddesses, only Krishna has been called 'purnavatar'

 Yogendra Yadav probably had to come forward only because of this controversy and due to the bad image of Swaraj India
 unhone fasebuk par lambii tippanee main likhaa he- 'main paramparaagat arth mendharmikanhin hum
 That is, do not worship, avoid rituals, do not go to the temple-mosque by myself, but do not despise religion, do not deny its importance
 kisi kii aasthaa kaa anadar nahin karata, chaahe wo aasthaa bhagwaan ke kisi nirgun yaa sagun rup main ho, kisi mahapurush main ho yaa kisi granth main
 So when a fellow takes a temple, gurudwara, church or dargah, or asks to garland a statue, i do not, but have been fascinated with spirituality since childhood
 yah to saafe tha ki jivan kaa arth keval bhautik sukh-suvidha yaa uplabdhiyon main nahin he
 As the age is increasing, the importance of making a better relationship with your inner self is beginning to be understood

 i am also learning from Gandhiji and Vinoba's commentary on Gita
 'devtaa kisi jati kaa nahin hota
 
 
 While linking Krishna with Yogendra Yadav's caste, people were quite curious about what he thought of Yaduvanshi Krishna, commenting on this, Yogendra wrote- 'the reference to saying all this sparked controversy since yesterday morning is
 aaj din bhar kai saathiyon ne mujhase bhagwaan krishna or hindu dharm par mere vichaar puche
 Many people referred to my special relationship with Sri Krishna as Yaduvanshi
 yah baat mere gale nahin utarati, kyonki koi mahapurush yaa devtaa kisi jati vishesh kii sampatti nahin hota
 'he has written-' Many people abused me wholeheartedly, said anti-hindu, communist and what came in his mouth

 yogendra yadav ne aage likhaa he-' darasal is sawaal par sochane main mujhe raamamanohar lohia se bahut madad mili he
 He wrote in detail about the main symbols of our culture
 main sochataa tha ki hindu dharm ke taintis karod devi-devataaon main shrikrishna ko hi 'purnavatar' kyon kaha gaya? lohia main mujhe iskaa uttar miltaa he
 Some of his quotes are: 'krishna of Raas and Krishna of Gita are one
 ''krishna usee tatva or mahaan prem kaa naam he jo man ko pradutt simaaon se ulanghta-ulanghta sabamein mila detaa he, kisi se bhi alag nahin rakhata
 "ram of Treta is such a man who constantly kept trying to become a god

 Ram is inflexible, Krishna is impassable

 Upon opening it you are asked if this domain is yours? That is, there is no existence of this website
 agar maan len ki yah Wikipedia kii chook he, kyonki yahaan duusare log bhi edit kar sakate hai
 Well, Congress's wiki page is secure, which cannot be edited

 An important film
 uttar pradesh ke kanpur ke paas buudhvaar subah sialdah-ajmer express patari se utar gai
 It is being told that 15 coaches of this train derailed due to which the accident occurred
 pareshaan karne vaali baat yah he ki abhi gat 20 november ko hi kanpur ke paas hi pukhraayaan main hue ek bade rail haadase main kareeb 142 logon kii maut ho gai thi, jab indore-patna intercity train ke 14 dibbe patna se utar gaye the
 Some coaches were completely turned into rubble after the accident
 lekin tamaam haadason ke baad bhi bhartiya rail apane musafiron kii suraksha ko lekar kitni gambhir he, yah kanpur ke paas phir se rail haadase se saaf ho gaya he
 By the way, many small and big train accidents happen every year in our country and 86 percent of these accidents are due to human mistakes
 lekin is tathy se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa he ki america or china ke baad duniya main teesraa sabase bada rail system hone ke baavjood bhartiya rail ab bhi british kaal ke infrastakchar par chal rahi he
 According to which the railway traffic pressure is increasing on the tracks, the infrastructure is not being upgraded accordingly
 ek ore to sarkaar bullate train chalaane kii yojana bana rahi he, duusari ore moolbhoot dhaanche main badlaav nahin hone kii vajah se saamaanya trainon ko haadason se bachaane main sarkaar naakaam dikh rahi he
 Safety is a major issue in front of the railway
 signling system main chook or anti coligen divises kii kami se bhi aae din haadase hote rahete hai
 Recommendations remain on paper only: The Justice HR Khanna Committee, formed in the year 1998, made a number of recommendations regarding safety
 ye siforishein railway ne maan to lee hai lekin ye abhi kaagajon par hi dikhti hai, jamini taur par inhen lagu kiya janaa baaki he
 The committee had advised to coordinate with the agencies of the US and Europe to take necessary measures to improve the friction between railway coaches
 mobile train radio communication ko priarity par rakhane jane kii salaah di gai thi lekin ab bhi yah masalaa 'lo priarity' par he
 Signal arrangements at railway crossings need to be improved but no action has been taken especially at 23,000 unmanned railway crossings of the country
 digestor training cell banaae jane kii baat bhi khanna cameti ne kii thi, lekin aapadaa prabandhan kaa str ab bhi us str par nahin he
 The most important recommendation was that the report of the investigation after the railway accidents be made public so as to instill confidence within the passengers but this recommendation has not been accepted yet

 Armed with the order of the Supreme Court, when the reporters reached the court on February 17, this time the lawyers were more than ever excited
 is baar kanhaiya ke saath hathapayee hi nahin kii gai, balki patharav bhi kiya gaya
 The news of the dismantling of the order started echoing in the high dome of the Supreme Court in a blink of an eye

 While two days ago when Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi visited the JNU campus and announced his full support to the students, Shah had written a long blog on February 15 asking Rahul, "is this the new national devotion of Congress definition?" After writing the blog, he made his point known to the public through a press conference
 shah ne kaha, “jeenyu main jo kuch bhi hua he, use kahin se bhi deshhit ke daayre main nahin rakhaa ja saktaa he

 Describing the government probe in the Malegaon, Ajmer and Hyderabad blasts case as part of a conspiracy of propaganda, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) wrote a letter to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to set up an independent commission to investigate these cases in a fair and transparent manner

 Giving information about the letter, All India Publicity Chief Manmohan Vaidya said, "the Sangh clearly believes that Colonel Purohit's role was political and he was doing nothing on the basis of his discretion
" uski koshish sangh or sahyogi sanghathanon main daraar paidaa karne kii thi
 He conspired to kill Sarsanghchalak Bhagwat and Indresh Kumar, which is known from the chargesheet of Maharashtra ATS
 ’unhone kaha ki iske baavjood jaanch agenciyaan aise logon se sangh kaa rishta jod rahi hai or hatya kii sajeesh ke pahalu par jaanch kaary aage nahin badha rahi hai
 The letter said, 'the entire conspiracy is indeed a political gimmick, so nothing can be revealed by mere criminal investigation
 is baat kaa pataa lagaaye jane kii jarurat he ki iske peeche kis prakaar kaa raajnneetik agenda he or is sajeesh ke peeche koun log hai
 An independent independent commission needs to be set up to investigate this
 ’yah puche jane par ki jab sangh ko jaanch agenciyon ke ravaiye par andeh tha to is vishay ko pehle kyon nahin uthaaya gaya, vaidya ne kaha, ‘ham pehle hi spasht kar chuke the ki jaanch prakriya main agenciyon ko puraa sahyog denge or hamaari apeksha thi ki jaanch kaary paardarshitapurna dhang se hoga
 But during this time we realized that the investigating agencies are deliberately harassing the workers and indulging in indecent behavior and characterization
 ’ unhone kaha ki jaanch ab aapraadhik maamle kii jaanch nahin rah gai he balki sangh ke viruddh raajnneetik agenda or dushprachaar kaa hathiyaar ban gai he
 a General Secretary of the Congress is also carrying out a malicious campaign against the Union, which confirms the political agenda
 vaidya ne kaha ki maharashtra aties ne sangh ke netaaon ko jaan se maarane kii sajeesh par jaanchakaarya ko aage nahin badhaayaa balki jaanch prakriya ko jaanboojhkar vikrut karne kaa prayaas kiya ja rahaa he
 If an unbiased investigation of this aspect comes to light, then the campaign against the Sangh will air
 joshi ne apane patr main likhaa he ki sangh aamtaur par raajnneetik satta se koi samvaad nahin karata lekin maamla samvedansheel he, at: isaki gambhirtha ko dekhte hue pratyaksh milakar is vishay par samvaad karne kaa avasar pradaan karen

 The ongoing political deadlock in the country is expected to end with Iraq's Prime Minister Nouri al-maliki withdrawing from his claim for a third term
 iraq kii sansad ke adhyaksh osama al-nujaiphi ne bhi agle kaarykaal kii daur se peeche hatane kaa sanket diya he
 Meanwhile, the United States has opposed a referendum on independence in Iraq's autonomous Kurdistan, saying it believes in staying strong in a united Iraq

 According to the news agency Xinhua, Nuzafi said, "under the new conditions, i announce the withdrawal of the name of the President of the Council of Representatives (iraqi Parliament) and whoever will be in this position to serve the public

 "according to the statement, Nuzaffee's withdrawal from Maliki's third term was linked to Nuzaffee's withdrawal from his name as" surprising and beyond logic "

 On the other hand, the United States has opposed a referendum on Iraq's autonomous Kurdish region to secede from the country

 He called this after Sunni militants of the Islamic State of Iraq and Greater Syria (ISIS) captured a large part of northern and western Iraq and remained aggressive

 Yes, it has become so easy to get a credit card loan
 credit card lone lenaa bhale hi aasaan he lekin iskaa intrest rate zyada hone ke chalate yah mahangaa he
 It is costlier than taking loans directly from banks
 lekin phir bhi kai baar logon ko credit card lone lenaa padataa he
 In such a situation, you should know when to take a credit card loan and when to give priority to the personal loan from the bank
 bhale hi credit card ke lone bhi personal lone ke intrest par hi diya ja rahaa ho lekin iske servicing ke chargees mahange hote hai
 Processing fees and pre-closure charges, credit card companies also levy service tax on the amount you pay as interest
 
 In such a situation, it is expensive
 sarvice tex vartmaan main 15 fisadi he (sarvice tex@14%+ svachh bharat tex@ 0
 5% + Agricultural Welfare Cess @ 0
 5%) Even if the interest rate, pre-closure charges and loan processing fees remain the same, the interest cost of credit card loans will be 15% higher due to service tax
 udhaaharan ke liye yadi aap bank se 1 lakh rupee kaa lone lete hai or is par vah 14 fisadi kaa byaaj 24 maheene kii miyaad par lagaataa he tab aapaki pehle maheene kii kist baithegi 4,802 rupee
 The interest share will be 1,166

 Yet on some occasions credit card loans are said to be better than taking a personal loan from a bank
 yadi aap 1 saal se kam samay ke liye 50 hajaar rupee se kam rakam lone par lenaa chaahate hon to credit card lone behatar he kyonki bank aamtaur par 1 saal se kam ke liye or 50 hajaar rupee se kam kaa lone nahin dete
 Whereas, credit card loans are also given for six months and for a minimum amount like 10 thousand
 aisi jaruraton par aap ise variyata de sakate hai

 For information, let us know that even if you convert a purchase made by credit card payment into an EMI (equated monthly instalment-emi), you pay interest only after applying service tax
 phir bhi kuch maukon par credit card lone ko bank se personal lone lene se behatar bataaya jaataa he
 If you want to take a loan less than Rs 50 thousand for less than 1 year, then credit card loan is better because banks usually do not give loans for less than 1 year and less than Rs 50 thousand
 jabaki, credit card lone chah maheene ke liye bhi dete hai or kam se kam rakam ke liye jaise ki 10 hajaar ke liye bhi dete hai
 You can give preference to such needs

 Delhi Police spokesman Rajan Bhagat said that we regret this unfortunate incident and BS Ahlawat, who is seen on camera doing this behavior, has been suspended and a departmental inquiry has been ordered
 is tarah kaa kadam bardaasht nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Actually, a 5-year-old innocent child was held hostage and raped in Gandhinagar for 2 days
 jab logon ko khabar lagi to ve aspataal ke baahar virodh-pradarshan karne pahunch gaye
 Khajuri Khas ACP Beni Singh Ahlawat was so enraged by the mob's anger that he slapped a girl seeking justice for the victim victim
 dhikkaar he is samaaj par, dhikkaar he samaaj ke haivaanon par or dhikkaar he dilli police par bhi jiskaa ek bada adhikari is ghatana kaa virodh kar rahi ladki ko saream thappad martha he
 The 5-year-old daughter went missing from home for about 48 hours
 na jane ek darinde ne yaa dheron darindon ne bacchee ko noncha khasota
 Everything could have been stopped if the smartest Delhi Police in the country had shown even the slightest speed and seriousness
 bacchee ke maa-baap apni ladli ke gaayab hone ke baad ilaake ke thane main police kii madad ke liye guhaar lagane pahunche lekin vahaan mila ko sirf ghanton kii maayusi or police kii badasluki
 There has been a ruckus after the girl met and revealed the matter
 aam aadmi parchi ke kaaryakartaaon ne police hai-hai ke naare lagaana shuru kar die
 But one aspect of the merciless face of the police was yet to be revealed
 jab hangaamaa zyada barpane laga to dilli police ne bacchee ke maa-baap ko chand rupayon kaa laalach dekar apana munh band rakhane kaa dabaav bananaa shuru kar diya
 The condition of innocent 5-year-old flower is still critical
 bacchee kii umr kam he or uske parivaar ko bhi apni ladli ke bachane kii ummid kam hi lag rahi he
 Always with you, for you
 dilli police kaa yahi naaraa he
 But if the Delhi Police had shown seriousness in the matter, today perhaps it would not have stood at the mouth of death as a victim of innocent flowers

 The condition of the innocent admitted in the ICU of a hospital in East Delhi is very critical
 haivaan ne bacchee ko do dinon tak kamare main baandhakar rakhaa
 The girl was raped and then tried to kill her with a blade

 According to the relative of the rape victim, the police instructed the media not to give information about the girl's generosity
 police par iljaam he ki munh band rakhane ke liye peedit ke pita ko 2000 rupee dene kii peshkash kii
 The anger at the leaders first fueled the anger and the way the Delhi Police injured the people

 It is being told that the candidates of Uttar Pradesh for the Lok Sabha elections will be selected by the end of February
 priyanka ko rahul gandhi se alag baithaae jane ke peeche kaa makasad saaf he ki congress kisi bhi surat main yah sandesh nahin dena chaahegi ki priyanka gandhi (priyanka Gandhi Vadra) ko rahul gandhi kii bahan or gandhi parivaar se aane kii vajah se koi adwantage mil rahaa he

 Incident: 1 The farmers of Garotha tehsil Kesimaria village of Jhansi district were disturbed for a long time by stray cows entering the fields

 Before the herd of cows entered the field, the villagers started chasing them

 The cows were now about to enter the village of Shajapur and the people there were equally stricken with cows

 When questioned, it was found that the people of the Rajput community of the nearby village of Nayapura were so upset with the loss of their crops to these animals that they were doing cruel work like throwing nails in the hooves of Gomata

 These two incidents of the same district of Bundelkhand, are happening in the same country, which has been witnessing the terror of cow protection for the last one or two years

 or halaat yahaan tak bigade ki khud pradhanmantri ko dakhal dekar kahana padaa ki goraksha ke naam par kuch asaamaajik tatv apni dukaan chalaa rahe hai
 In such an aggressive phase of cow protection, why were the villagers forced to go on Gopratada instead of cow protection? These incidents have not happened only in these villages
 bundelkhand ke kisi bhi jile kii police se puch lijie, vah aapako bataaegi ki khet main gaay haankane ko lekar gaanv waalon ke bich jhadap ke maamle unke paas aae din aa rahe hai
 In these cases the police are unable to convince the villagers and there is no question of explaining the cow

 At the same time, in Udaipura and Khilwani villages of Raisen district of Madhya Pradesh, farmers came face to face when farmers of one village filled the cows in tractors and left them in the other village

 Such incidents also came to the notice when the villagers in the areas of Uttar Pradesh kept the first condition to get rid of the stray cows in front of the potential assembly candidates

 Homeless and infertile cows, India is the world's largest milk producing country
 14
 Buffalo and cow play the main role in the production of 63 million tonnes of milk annually
 2012 kii pashuganana uthaakar dekhen to pataa chalegaa ki desh ke 51 karod maweshiyon main se govansh kii sankhya 19 karod ke kareeb he
 If we remove the bulls and calves from it, the cow's population is more than 12 crores
 sankhya ke lihaaj se gaay bhainson se doguni he
 And speaking of villages only, on an average 306 cows sit in each village
 lekin asal dikkat jammu-kashmir ke animal breeding visheshgy farhat umr kuch is tarah bataate hai, ''israel main ek gaay jahaan salanaa 10,000 litre se adhik doodh detii he, vahiin hamaare yahaan gaay ausatan 2,000 se 2,500 litre salanaa doodh detii he
 "cows of Indian breeds like Sahiwal, Tharparkar and Gir certainly give very good quantity of milk, but the number of cows of such pure breed is very limited
 gaanv main aawaara chhod di gai gaayen, isi bigadi nasl kii hai jo kam doodh de rahi hai
 It is not that only the breed of these cows has been spoiled, one of the reasons for giving less milk is the diseases that are growing in them
 gaay badi sankhya main aant kii tibi (johnij tibi) kii shikaar hai
 Due to this disease, the cow's body does not start eating
 yahi nahin jo desi gaay puure jivan main 10-12 saal tak doodh de sakati he, vah do se teen bacchon ke janm ke baad hi banjh ho jaati he
 Instead of raising such a cow, people are realizing their goodness in giving up stray

 The use of plow and bullock in farming is now negligible
 ve puri tarah anupayogi ho gaye hai
 Earlier, the common practice in North India was that people used to sell their calves to traders coming from other states
 ye vyapaaree gaanv-gaanv se bachade kharidte hue, bada jhund taiyaar karte the or phir jugat bhidaakar inhen kisi bujadkaane tak bhej dete the
 Since the calf did not bite in front of the eye or in the surrounding area, this did not put the burden of cow slaughter on the soul of the farmer and practically the village did not have to bear the burden of this unusable animal
 uttar pradesh yojana ayog ke sadsy sudhir panvar kehete hai, ''itnaa to kaha hi ja saktaa he ki ugr goraksha ke kaaran log bachhda bechney or kharidne se bachane lage hai

 "although there has been a slight decrease in the number of cattle in the 2012 cattle census compared to the 2007 cattle census, it does not mention whether the number of stray cattle or cattle has decreased or has already increased

 The land on which cattle used to graze grass is now being cultivated
 agar jhaansi kii hi misaal len to jile main 200 acre jameen gochar ke naam par darj he
 But the reality is that most of this land has been illegally occupied
 kisaan netaa shivnarayan singh parihaar bataate hai ki mayawati sarkaar ke samay gochar kii jameen main se hi logon ko patte bhi die gaye
 But in Revan village similar lease holders Kallu Ahirwar, Ghasita and Sarman turn back and ask, "the government has given us leases
" ve gram samaaj kii jameen par mili hai yaa gochar jameen par yah sarkaar jane
 Where is our fault in this? ”if you look at the broad aspect of the problem, you will find that 14 crore hectares of land is cultivated in the country
 pehle isamen se 10 fisadi jameen charaagaah ke liye uplabdh thi, is samay charaagaah ke liye uplabdh jameen ghatakar 4 se 5 fisadi hi bachi he
 In such a situation, cattle are forced to move to the fields to feed
 or yaheen se insaan or gaay ke bich tanaav shuru ho jaataa he
 Khemchandra Sharma, Union Minister of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, Gousseva, taking the side of the cow in this struggle, says, "the government should remove the occupation from the land of the land and create a sanctuary
 "vaise, is tanaav ko ghaatak hone se bachaane ke liye pehle jaanwaron kii jail yani kanji house kaa vikalp hua karata tha
 Under this, it was arranged that if an animal entered someone's farm, the owner of the farm could lock that animal in Kanji House
 maveshi ke maalik ko jab isaki jaankaree hoti thi to vah nirdhaarit jurmaana chukaakar maveshi ko chhudaa letaa tha
 The Kanji House was operated by the Gram Panchayats in the rural areas and the municipal bodies in the urban areas
 jhaansi jile main hi pehle aath gaanv par ek kanji house tha
 But as the number of stray animals increased and the number of cattle rescuers in Kanji House decreased, their operations became difficult
 is samay jile main ek bhi kanji house kaam nahin kar rahaa he
 The worst was in Kanji House in Jhansi city
 hua yah ki 1997-98 main bijepi ke dhannulaal gautam nagar palika ke chairman bane or jhaansi sadar se hi bijepi vidhayak ravindra shukla mantri bane
 With the efforts of both leaders, the proposal to give the land of Kanji House to the district office of BJP was passed by the municipality
 yahaan ab bijepi kaa jila karyaalay chalata he
 Shukla says, "kanji House was in ruins, we took the initiative to set up a BJP office there

 According to information received by RTI from environmental activist Ashish Sagar, nine goshalas are registered in the district
 in goshaalaon main kul milakar 295 gaay-bail or bachade-bachhiyaan hai
 May be these gaushalas serve them best, but so many stray animals will be found standing at the crossroads of four villages of Banda district

 "in Maharashtra too, strict measures were taken by the police for cow protection

 Financial scandals in the country went on in series and as a result, the biggest bank scam stands in front of the country in 2018
 pichley ghotaalon kii tarah yah ghotaalaa bhi adaalaton ke chakkar kaatane main dam tod saktaa he
 Compared to previous scams, this financial scam has been done more cleanly and recklessly and the scamsters have also challenged the government not to return the money and do what they were doing to the government
 lihaaja, is sabase bade ghotaale ke baad sawaal khadaa hota he ki kya aise ghotaalon ko rokna sarkaar ke liye sambhav he
 India Today editor Anshuman Tiwari said that it is possible to stop such scams forever provided the government is ready to take these 5 steps: 1
 roshni kii maangais ghotaale main exiaar ke 15 din baad koharaam kyon machaa
 Actually, when the PNB informed the matter to the stock exchange, it was found out what happened
 kaarobaariyon ko janata kii adaalat main laayaa janaa chahie
 50 crores Rs

 Ten thousand crores in India

 karj chahie to puunji dikhieyadi pravartak apni puunji par jokhim nahin letaa to phir dipositor kii bachat par jokhim kyon karj par kaarobaar ke (date finance) ke niyam badalanaa jaruri he
 Now there is a need for companies that do business with transparency by taking capital from the public or the promoters put their own capital
 3
 There are more potholes
 We were eroding the mountain of outstanding bank loans (npas) and nirav-mehul short-term buyers' credit (90-180-360 days) loaning Rs 11,000 crore
 (yaa 20,000 karod ru
 ) Le flees, which the importers use for working capital
 ise padhein: neerav modi ko kyon lagata he 2G-CWG jaisaa hoga PNB ghotaale kaa hashr?udhaar main kaarobaar, supplai chen kii kamajori or kharaab cash flo kii vajah se bhartiya companiyaan sakriy kaarobaari (varking) puunji ko lekar hameshaa dabaav main rahati hai
 When large companies of India to make their operations comfortable, the annual revenue of four trillion rupees
 (arnst and yang—2016) kii atirikt varking capital chahie to choti fermon kii kya haalat hogi
 There should be a change in the system of short-term loans from banks
 gaiyr jamaanti karj simit hone ke baad companiyaan apane sanchaalan ko chust karne par baadhya hongi
 The business of depositors has to be stopped

 Who is not aware of the political hank of the dirty businessmen of political donations? jo hukkaam ke saath dinar karte hai vahi chanda bhi dete hai, ve hi bainkon ke sabase bade karjadaar bhi hai
 If the country gets to know how much money is paid by which company to which party, then there will be a lot of transparency, including the robbery of banks through political influence
 dhyaan rahe ki mehul chokasee kaa kaarobaari ricard katai is laayak nahin tha ki unhen yaa unke bhaanje par punjab neshnal bank is kadar dulaar udelta, haa yah baat zarur he ki unka raajnneetik rasookh unhen har syah safed kii suvidha detaa tha

 The amount of this scam is ten times the profits of PNB
 bank ko haal main sarkaar se jitani puunji mili thi, uskaa doguna yah donon lut le gaye
 As the size of the economy increases, the country needs big banks to withstand such shocks
 ise padhein: ek saal baad mukhyamantri yogi ne upi ko diya vikaas kaa gujarat modelbhrashtachar cheharaa dekhakar yaa bhaashanon se nahin rukta
 Successes against institutional corruption have always come only with the help of institutions (law, courts, auditors)
 pichley chaar saal main na to sansthaaen majboot or viksit huin or na nae kanoon, niyam banaae yaa badale gaye
 As long as corruption was closed, there was bliss, now it is opening then it is blooming
 bank kisi bhi arthvyavastha main bharose kaa aakhri centre hai
 The money kept in it is of our savings, not of the government
 agar yah lut khatm kerani he, to paardarshita ke nae praavdhaan chahie
 Governments will not increase transparency until we deeply doubt their functioning

 supreme court ne centre sarkaar se poocha he ki raajnneeti kaa apradheekaran rokane ke liye kadaa kanoon banane ke uske aadesh par aaj tak amal kyon nahin kiya gaya
 In September last year, a 5-judge constitution bench had asked the central government to immediately enact laws to ban those involved in serious crimes from contesting elections and becoming party officials
 bijepi netaa or vakil ashvini upaadhyaay ne centre sarkaar or chunaav ayog ke khilaaf avmaananaa yachika daakhil kar aarope lagaaya he ki raajnneeti kaa apradheekaran rokane ke liye court ke aadesh ke baavjood pichley chah maheene main koi gambhir prayaas nahin kiya gaya
 After hearing Upadhyay's arguments, the court has sought answers from the Cabinet Secretary and Law Secretary, Government of India
 ummidavaaron ke aapraadhik record or sampatti aadi kaa byoraa media main prakashit prachaarit karne ke aadesh par amal na hone kaa mudda uthaane vaali duusari avmaananaa yachika par supreme court ne chunaav ayog se jawaab maanga he
 The court has issued notice to the three Deputy Commissioners seeking a reply in a week, terming the matter raised in Upadhyay's contempt petition as serious
 ye aadesh nyaayamurti aaref naariman or vineet sharan kii peeth ne shuukravaar ko yachika par sunwaayee ke baad diya
 In the contempt petition, Upadhyay has said that the government has not complied with the order of September 25 last year, in which the court said that people accused of serious and heinous crimes should be stopped from contesting elections and their membership in the court The government enacted strict laws to do this
 is yachika main upaadhyaay ne cabinet sachiv or vidhi maamalon ke sachiv ko pratipakshi banaaya he
 Both Upadhyay's contempt petitions are actually in the matter of non-implementation of the instructions of the five-judge constitution bench of the Supreme Court on September 25 last year
 25 sintabar ke faisle main supreme court ne aadesh diya tha ki prayek ummidavaar namakan bharne ke baad kam se kam 3 baar akhbaar main apane aapraadhik byore or anya jaankariyon vaale halafname kaa byoraa prakashit karaayenge or iske alaava samachar channel me bhi 3 baar ise prasaarit karaayenge taaki matadaataaon ko ummidavaaron ke bare main jaankaree ho sake
 The court also said that political parties will also upload the details of the candidate on their website
 akhbaar or samachar channelon main bhi prakashit karenge
 Upadhyay has alleged in the contempt petition that this order of the court has not been properly followed in the five assembly elections held recently
 unka kahana he ki chunaav ayog ne is bare main spasht disha nirdesh jari kar yah nahin bataaya he ki ummidavaar kin akhabaaron main byoraa prakashit karaayenge or kin samachar channelon main kis samay byoraa prasaarit kiya jayega

 Whether you play in India or abroad, if your bowlers cannot take 20 wickets, then you cannot win a Test match

 The second suspect is alleged to have committed the rape case in Koparkhairane and Turbhe
 tippaniyan These two suspects, aged about 20 to 25 years, have committed 7 incidents in Mumbai and Navi Mumbai from April to August
 vaardaat ko anjaam dene kaa donon tarika ek jaisaa he lekin kya donon aapas main mili hue hai, ye abhi saaf nahin ho paaya he
 According to the police, investigations have so far revealed that these lower middle-class minors first identify the girls, then ask them to accompany them, saying that their father has called them from work

 Searching is going on at all possible locations by building separate teams of crime branch and police but it is not possible to get them captured due to lack of any information about both of them apart from the photo

 Since 2 cases are also related to Kandivali and Dindoshi in Mumbai, Mumbai police is also looking for both the suspects
 takreeban 20 se 25 saal ke ye donon sandigdh april se agast tak mumbai or navi mumbai me 7 vaardaaton ko anjaam de chuke hai
 Both the ways of carrying out the crime are the same, but whether the two are together, it is not yet clear

 When the girl is ready to walk, she takes her away in seclusion and runs away after committing the crime
 sisitivi ke jariye police ko donon kii tasviren bhi mil chuki hai lekin abhi tak donon hi pakad se baahar hai
 According to the Navi Mumbai Police, every effort is being made to apprehend the two
 krime branch or police kii alag-alag timen banaakar sabhi sambhavit thikaanon par talaashi jari he lekin tasviir ke alaava donon ke bare main koi bhi jaankaree uplabdh nahin ho paane se inhen pakadaa paanaa sambhav nahin ho paa rahaa he
 Therefore, a reward of 10 thousand rupees has also been announced to those giving information about them
 chunki 2 maamle mumbai main kandiwali or dindoshi ke bhi hai isliye mumbai police bhi donon sandigdhon kii talash main juty he
 Police have also received photographs of both of them through CCTV but so far both are out of the hold

 BJP president Amit Shah claimed in Aajtak's program, straight talk, that in 2019, BJP will win 22 Lok Sabha seats out of total 42 seats in West Bengal
 bijepi ke bengal mishan main ye 5 factor kargar sabit ho sakate hai
 1
 dhruvikaran kii bisatbijepi assam or tripura kii tarj par pashchim bengal main bhi apni jaden jamaane main lagi he
 The Muslim population in the state is around 30 percent

 ' aam aadmi party par ab use mili chande main gadabadi karne kaa aarope laga he
 The accuser is none other than Aam Aadmi Party MLA Colonel Devendra Sehrawat, who was suspended by the party recently
 aaropon ke mutabik party ko mili chande kaa hisaab-kitaab gadabad he or jitna paisa chande main party ne logon se liya, use puraa kaa puraa chunaav ayog main di gai jaankaree main nahin dikhaaya gaya
 Speaking to reporters at the Press Club in Delhi, MLA Sehrawat alleged that 1600 entries worth Rs 16 crore, which were shown on the AAP website, were hidden from the Election Commission
 matlab ayog ko jo jaankaree party kii taraf se di gai usamen ye entries nahin he
 This means that the party took donations, but did not show it in its account, then where did the money go

 Colonel Sehrawat and his colleagues claimed that 26 such people were named on their website, who had given large sums of money to the party, but these names were missing from the party's account records
 hairaani to is baat kii he ki party ke sansthaapak sadsy rahe shanti bhushan ne do karod rupee kaa chanda diya tha, lekin chunaav ayog ke saath chande kii jo jaankaree saajha kii gai, usamen shanti bhushan ke naam par sirf 42 lakh rupye chanda diye jane kaa zikr he
 Similarly, there are many other people, the amount of their donation was also reduced or not shown at all
 is bare main jab varisht vakil shanti bhushan se baat kii gai, to unhone camere par bolne se inkaar kar diya, lekin is baat kii tasdik kii ki unhone do karod kaa chanda diya, jab party kaa gathan hi hua tha
 Not only this, at the time of the Lok Sabha elections, one crore rupees were given in donations

 The Aam Aadmi Party has at the moment refused to give any response on the matter, saying that at present there is no one available to talk on this issue
