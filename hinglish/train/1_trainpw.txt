 Priyanka Gandhi's magic is speaking to the heads of allies besides the Congress
 bihar main congress ke saath milakar bijepi ko dhul chataane vaali jediu kii nigahen ab uttar pradesh par hai, lekin rajya main apni party kii haisiyat se waakif jediu ab congress ke peeche khadi hone ko taiyaar he, jisase bijepi ko roka ja sake or iske liye usne bhi daanv lagaaya he priyanka gandhi par
 Now JDU is also following the path of Prashant Kishore advising Congress that UP needs a big face and Voprianka Gandhi can be
 jediu mahasachiv or pravaktaa kasee tyaagi ne aaj tak se baatcheet main kaha ki, priyanka siem ummidavaar bane to janata, congress or hamaare jaise unke sahyogiyon ko hi chunegi
 Tyagi also said that, if Priyanka does not want to become CM candidate, then at least not be limited to Amethi and Rae Bareli
 priyanka puure pradesh main prachaar karen
 Nitish and Priyanka's attraction will remain hitjdu believes that Nitish's clean image and Priyanka's attraction among the public will be a hit in the election, the joint rallies of the two will make our alliance in UP popular among the public, which will benefit the Congress
 Because, we realize our strength in UP and we want to remain in the role of younger brother
 haalanki abhi tak jediu kii taraf se aadhikarik taur par congress ko koi prastaav nahin diya gaya he
 But jduka says that Prashant Kishore has already given this proposal to the Congress and the final decision has to be taken by the Congress and the Gandhi family
 JDU kaa maananaa upi main bijepi ko rokna jaruridarasal, prashanth kishor kii tarj par jediu kaa bhi maananaa he kiyupi main bijepico congress ne nahin roka to 2019 kii raah mushkil ho jaayegi
 Therefore, Priyanka should be fielded as a star campaigner, not least the CM
 upi main nahin banegaa bijepi virdohi mahagathbandhanwaise abhi tak upi main jediu or congress kaa aupchaarik samjhauta nahin hua he
 Rashtriya Lok Dal chief Ajit Singh is sometimes talking to JDU or BJP
 sapa or bispi kisi se samjhauta kar nahin rahe, aise main bihar kii tarj par bijepi virodh kaa mahagathbandhan upi main hota na dekh ab jediu ko shaayad priyanka gandhi hi iklauta turup kaa ikkaa najar aa raheen hai
 After all, Nitish is also eyeing the pm's chair in 2019
 lekin priyanka par aakhri faisla to gandhi parivaar hi karegaa, jiske jawaab kaa intjaar prashanth kishor or congress kaaryakartaaon ke saath hi ab jediu ko bhi rahegaa

 shahrukh or gauri ek parfect kapal he or unke parfect kapal hone ke kaaran aap bhi jaan lijie
 Not only Anushka, Deepika, every girl can breakup because of this
 
 
 1
 Family Commitment: Despite being the most successful actor of Bollywood and the second richest actor in the world, Shah Rukh always takes time out for his family and is also very protective of his family
 gauri ko jab bhi unki jarurat hoti he wo hameshaa unke saath khadey rahete hai
 They always want to keep their children away from the media
 shahrukh ek parfect hasband hone ke saath-saath parfect pita bhi hai
 2
 pyaar:shahrukh orgauriki lav-story saadhaaran lekin bahut khubasurat he
 Shah Rukh was dead on Gauri's beauty, while Gauri liked Shahrukh's temperament, his self-confidence
 donon ke liye shaadi karnaa aasaan nahin tha
 Shahrukh had to work very hard to convince Gauri's family
 alag dharm kaa hona to kaaran tha hi saath hisamasyayah bhi thi ki shahrukh us samay saital nahin the
 But the two managed to convince the family and on 25 October 1991, the two got married
 ye donon kaa kamitment or pyaar hi tha ki donon apane sapane ko puraa kar paae

 Both have full faith in each other and this is the basis of their successful married life

 Despite all this, Gauri never considered career above her family

 Prime Ministerial candidate and Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi from BJP has welcomed the decision of 'right to Reject' during the Supreme Court voting
 narendra modi ne apane blog par likhaa, 'main tahe dil se is faisle kaa swaagat karata hum
 'modi wrote,' The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the morning directed the Election Commission that voters should also be given the right to reject the candidates during the voting
 'modi ne likhaa, 'main is faisle kaa tahe dil se swaagat karata hum
 i hope that this decision will have a big impact on our democracy
 is faisle se hamaara loktantr pehle se zyada sudrudh or aakarshak ho jayega
 Modi said that he had advocated for Right to Reject in elections for a long time, without which there was some deficiency in the system
 modi ke mutabik, 'abhi aisa he ki agar ek seat se 10 ummidavaar khadey hote hai, to voter ko unheen 10 main se ek ummidavaar chunane ke liye baadhya ho jate hai
 This decision will empower the voters and they will be able to express their anger and reject the candidate
 'modi ne likhaa, 'is adhikaar se voter ye sandesh de paaenge ki ham ummidavaar, ummidavaar kii party or party policy ko pasand nahin karte hai
 We had brought a bill to make voting compulsory, including the Right to Reject, but the Congress Party was vehemently opposed
 ye bill 2 baar 2008 or 2009 main paas kiya gaya tha, lekin mananeey governor ne is par roak laga di thi
 'modi also wrote,' But friends Right to reject and debate on compulsory voting has no meaning unless you are a registered voter
 maine suna he ki 18 se 24 saal ke kai yuva hai jinhone voter ke taur par abhi tak registration nahin karaayaa he
 Nothing could be more unfortunate than this
 'modi ne likhaa, 'loktantr ko sirf humlog majboot bana sakate hai
 As a voter, we are the 'fortune teller' of our country
 supreme court ne aaj jo kaha wo shandaar he lekin ab hamaari baari he ek saath khadey hone kii or apane loktantr ko or majboot banane kii
 So that our country will grow well in the coming times

 The Yogi government's initiative on the procession of Shias on Muharram has been successful
 jis juluus kii vajah se amuman muharram ke din lakhanu shahar main shiya or sunniyon kaa takaraav hota tha, is baar yogi sarkaar ne use sulajhaa diya he

 For the first time in Yogi government in Lucknow, the procession of Mohamoharram has been changed
 prashasan or muslim moulana ke aapasi sahmati se har varsh moharram ke juluus ko jis raste se le jaaya jaataa tha, usko badal diya gaya he
 However, the reason for this is believed to be an advisory of the court, in which it was asked to change the way voluntarily, because the path on which the procession used to go, had three hospitals on that route
 lihaaja juluus kii vajah se hospital main aane vaale marijo ko dikkaton kaa saamana karnaa padataa tha
 The officials and administration of the Yogi government have changed the way of meeting with the Muslim Maulana
 ajtak se baatcheet main shiya moulana ne nae raste ko lekar apni khushi jaahir kii he
 They say that they can take a procession of their weeds without any trouble on the new path they have found
 lakhanu ke esaspi deepak kumaar ne kaha ki yah aitihaasik badlaav he
 Never before has this route changed and today by mutual consent, this route has changed, which all Maulana agreed to
 maamle main shiya moulana ne kaha ki yah sarkaar kii acchhee shuruyaat he, jo usne hamaare bare main sochaa or hamen nayaa rasta uplabdh karaayaa
 Abbas of Lucknow Procession Working Committee said that this procession always used to go through the same route and would still go today, but we changed the way due to the efforts of the government and the hospital
 ab duusare raste se moharram nikaala jayega, jisko sarkaar ne durust bhi kar diya he

 He worked hard to add new allies to the Shiv sena-bjp alliance and made inroads into the congress-ncp stronghold in western Maharashtra in the recent Lok Sabha elections
 unhone kaha, lekin kismat ko kuch or bhi manjuur tha
 Mundeji's death is a loss not only to the Shiv sena-bjp but also to Maharashtra
 shivasena ke varisht netaa subhash desai ne kaha, maharashtra main apni netritv kshamta kaa parichay dene ke baad munde ko rashtriya str par apni pratibha dikhaane kaa avasar mila tha
 It is a matter of sorrow that his political tenure ended prematurely in such a sad way

 There is a tense atmosphere in Tamil Nadu over the Cauvery water dispute, due to which all the matches of IPL from Chennai have been shifted to another venue
 kaveri prabandhan board ke gathan ko lekar tamilnadu main raajnneetik dalon kaa virodh pradarshan jari he
 After which the Chennai Police has refused to provide security to the IPL
 bataa den ki mangalvaar ko chepock ke maidan par do saal baad ipel kaa match khelaa gaya tha, chennai super kings or kolkata nite rides ke bich mukaable ke dauraan bhi virodh pradarshan hua
 M
 this season
 e
 a total of seven matches were to be held at the Chidambaram Stadium, of which only one match was held
 IPL kamishnar rajeev shukla ne suraksha badhaane ko lekar kendriya grih sachiv se bhi baat kii or chennai main IPL maichon kii suraksha ke liye siarpief kii tukadiyaan bhejne kaa prastaav rakhaa
 But it did not work
 jiske baad BCCI ke saamne chennai ke maichon kaa venue badalane ke alaava or koi rasta nahin bachaa
 IPL matches scheduled to be held in Chennai, to be shifted to another venue: Sources # cauveryprotestspic

 com / rknbpxk6hn — ANI (@ANI) April 11, 2018 On Tuesday, protesters threw shoes on the ground during a match between Chennai Super Kings and Kolkata Knight Riders in IPL
 kuch yuva pradarshnkaree stadium ke andar ghus gaye or unhone maidan par ek jodi juute phenk die
 This case happened in the eighth over of Kolkata's innings
 crik info kii report ke mutabik yah juute simarekha ke paas tainaat chennai ke fielder rabindra jadeja ko nishaanaa banaakar phenke gaye
 These shoes were thrown from the Pattabhiraman Gate
 iske baad ek-do juute or phenke gaye jisamen se ek juuta south africa captain phalf du placi ko jaakar laga
 Due to which he also looked very angry
 iske baad du placi juuta uthaakar waapas phenk rahe the
 Please tell that du Plessi was not playing in this match
 iske baad police harakat main ai or darshakon main se 2 logon ko giraftaar kiya
 Policemen and officials of Chennai Superkings approached the stadium and removed people from near the border
 aapako bataa den ki match se pehle bhi vibhinn raajnneetik dalon ke pradarshnkaree sarvocch nyaayalay dwaara nirdeshit kaveri prabandhan board (siembi) or kaveri jal niamak samiti (seedbluarsi) kaa gathan nahin karne ke liye centre sarkaar ke khilaaf narebaaji kar rahe the
 Actor Rajinikanth has also expressed opposition
 Let me tell you that in the past, actor Rajinikanth has also said that it is shameful to play the match in Chennai, because the people of Tamil Nadu are burning with the Cauvery water dispute and the match is going to happen here
 vahiin abhinayta rajnikant ne yah bhi kaha tha, ki 'agar yahaan match hota bhi he, to chennai super kings ke khilaadiyon ko apane-apane haathon par kaale rang kii pattee baandhna hoga, jisase yah mudda or aage bade or kaveri jal vivaad khatm ho
 'what is the Kaveri water dispute, tell you that the river Kaveri, whose origin is in Kodagu district of Karnataka state, is about one and a half hundred kilometers long
 lekin abhi vivaad yah he ki kam barish ke kaaran yahaan is nadi main pani kii maatra kam he
 For this reason, Karnataka has refused to provide water to Tamil Nadu, due to which it has been in dispute for many years
 saath hi iske liye tamilnadu ne supreme court tak bhi gaye he
 Thus, the way the Cauvery dispute is going on in Tamil Nadu these days is very wrong for the people there
 reatin4 stardiarectarali abbaas jafarkalakaarasalamaan khan, anoushka sharma or randeep hoodasubah ke nau baje kaa sho, or haul main andhere ke bich ekadam se sitiyon kaa shor
 This noise was not for anyone else but Bollywood's Bhaijaan and Sultan Salman Khan
 akhaade main pahalawaanon ko chit karata sultan dekhakar darshakon kii sitiyaan bajane lagi thim, or jabardast shor bhi
 Then if there is a single screen cinema then this noise doubles
 yah cinemaghar lagbhag 70 fisadi phul tha
 After 'prem Ratan Dhan Payo', Salman Khan has knocked on Eid, and this time again he has brought a storm of tremendous action with the emotions as his fans had expected
 unhone is baar ek pahalwaan ke kirdaar ko parade par jiya he, or unhone apane phans ko sitiyaan bajaane or mast hone ke bharpoor lamhe bhi die hai
 The biggest feature of the film is that Salman Khan has introduced a larger than life hero through the simple man of the village
 kahani main kitna damafilm kii kahani rewadi kesalmaan khan kii he jo cabel tivi kaa dhandhakarata he or jisaki umr tees saal he
 He is busy with fun and his father is a bit upset about this
 lekin sultan ko anoushka se pyaar ho jaataa he or phir pyaar jo na karaae vah kam
 Anushka befriends but desi laundries often consider friendship to be love
 sultan bhi yahi bhul kar baithta he
 Then Anushka challenges her self-respect, then Sultan's life changes
 phir shuru hota he imoshans kaa tufaan
 Wrestling tricks and plenty of spice
 kahani aisi he, jisamen ishk, acshan or imoshans kaa bharpoor chhaunk he
 Then Salman is the only shadow in the whole story
 star apilasalmaan khan kaa jadoohai or samarpit phans hai jo unhen parade par kuch karte dekhte hue pasand karte hai
 Seeing Salman betting, it seems that he has worked hard for the film
 lekin mjedaar yah ki bhai ne kushti premiyon ke liye kushti seekhney kaa krash course bhi film main dikhaa diya he
 It has also been explained that age is just a number
 isse zyada kuch nahin kyonki bhai 30 kii umr main kushti shuru karte hai or ek maheene main state champion ban jate hai
 Only Salman can really do this
 anoushka kii acting bhi thik he
 Hariyani sounds fun to listen to
 ali abbaas jafar ne achche se dimag lagaate hue film main bhai ko apane haath dikhaane ke bharpoor maukey die hai or unke chaahane waalon ko sitiyaan bajaane ke
 The film has good music, and keeps the fans of Salman engrossed while watching the film
 film kaa bajet lagbhag 90 karod ru
 Is told
 sultan ko buudhvaar ko relies kiya gaya he, is tarah iske paanch din hai, jisamen yah moti kamai kar sakati he
 Anyway, Salman Khan is known for making records, it remains to be seen how far this time Salman Khan's fans take him
 unhone kaha ki isi hisaab se 2018-19 tak sakal fasalkrut kshetra (jisie) ke 50 pratishat kshetra tak beemaa suraksha badhaane ke liye lakshya nirdhaarit kiye gaye hai saath hi rajyon ko is yojana ke tahat adhik kshetron or fasalon ko shaamil karne kii salaah di gai he

 ) america actress demi moore kii beti scout wilis ne instagram kii sensorship policy ke khilaaf pichley mangalvaar ko toplace pradarshan kiya
 In order to express his anger, the scout went topless and went shopping
 yahi nahin iske baad unhone apni toplace tasviren twitor account par bhi aplod kar deen
 Website xojane
 com par ek lekh ke jariye safai dete hue scout ne likhaa he, 'main neuyork main toplace hokar ghoomane nikali or is bare main twitor par jaanakri bhi di
 i wanted to say that according to the law of the state of New York, what is right is illegal in Instagram '
 unhone apane is lekh kaa sheershak rakhaa he, 'ai em scout wilis and dis ij da only thing ai haev tu se about walking toplace down da streats of neuyork last wyk'
 In fact, 22-year-old Scout Willis uploaded a photo of a topless woman in her Instagram account, after which the social networking site closed her account
 isi ke virodh main wilis ne pichley hafte toplace hokar apane gusse kaa izhaar kiya
 During this time, she was wearing only skirts and sandals with floral prints
 abhinayta bruce wilis or demi moore kii beti ne apane lekh main likhaa he, 'mujhe pataa he ki log mujhe gambhirtha se nahin lenge or unhen lagegaa ki main sirf dhyaan khinchne ke liye aisa kar rahi hum
 i know that i was born in a high-profile and wealthy household, but by doing so i have given a historical example against lingering favoritism '
 unke mutabik, '1936 main hi purushon ko chaati kholkar ghoomane kii ijaajat de di gai thi
 But why can't women do it even after 80 years? Why a mother cannot feed her child in public? Why Facebook and Instagram have no objection to the topless photo of a woman who has breast-removed to defeat cancer, but the entire breast is particularly problematic with the breast surgery without surgery '
 apane baat ke samarthan main wilis ne kaha, 'main mahilaon ke us adhikaar kii baat kar rahi hum, jiske tahat wo jaise chahen vaise apane sharir ko pregent kar sakati hai
 Here i am debating to give women the freedom to choose according to their own will and not in a society where women always live under the fear of what people will think about them and how the society will react '

 Former Deputy Chief Minister of Maharashtra and NCP leader Ajit Pawar has been in a ruckus over the concession in the Anti Corruption Bureau investigation
 sinchai ghotaale kii jaanch main ACB ab pavaar se likhit jawaab legi lekin is raahat par kai ungliyaan uth rahi hai
 Ajit Pawar will not have to face the sharp questions of ACB like Chhagan Bhujbal
 karodon ke sinchai ghotaale kii jaanch main lage anti karpshan beuro ne pavaar ko ACB ke daftar raahat de di he
 Ajit Pawar can answer questions of investigation without going to ACB office, for which ACB will send a list of questions to former Deputy Chief Minister
 BJP ne banaai thi sitsawwa main aane ke baad bijepi ne sinchai ghotaale kii jaanch ke liye ekaspecial invastigeshan team(sit) kaa gathan kiya tha
 Ajit Pawar and then NCP state president Sunil Tatkare are also accused in the irrigation scam
 vahiin, ACB maharashtra sadan ghotaale kii jaanch bhi kar rahi he jisamen chagan bhujabal aaropon ke ghere main he
 The ACP has summoned the office and recorded the statement of Bhujal, including his son Pankaj and nephew Sameer, but Ajit Pawar is fortunate that he will not have to face the direct questions of the ACB
 chunaav ke baad badi nazdikiyanchunaav ke baad ensipi ne devendra fadanvis sarkaar ko khulkar samarthan kaa elaan kar diya tha
 From that time, the nexus of the NCP and BJP began to be heard in the political circles
 kaha to ye bhi ja rahaa he ki bijepi ne ajit pavaar ko sirf yahi phayda nahin pahunchaaya he
 Before the fight for supremacy within the party, the ACB had summoned Pawar for questioning last month
 pavaar ne uskaa bhi jawaab nahin diya or baad main apni safai main pavaar ne kah diya ki wo rajya main nahin the or isliye unke liye ACB ke daftar pahunchnaa mumkin nahin tha
 Please tell that in both the leaders of Ajit Pawar and Chhagan Bhujbal, there has always been a discussion of the battle of supremacy within the party

 But according to the school association, only 15 to 20 schools fall under the 62 criterias on which the Delhi government has taken such a strong stand against schools
 jabaki dilli main 1500 se zyada privet skool hai or ye puri tarah in niyamon kaa paalan kar rahe hai
 According to private schools, the Delhi government should not look at all schools with one eye

 But it is not appropriate to make such allegations on all schools

 The private school has refused to obey the order declaring the Delhi government's management quota as illegal and not only interfering in the work of private schools, but instead has advised to start nursery class by improving the level of government schools

 Even after the Congress gets a majority, they are ready to support the Dalit Chief Minister

 When the BJP and PDP governments were formed in the valley, the Kashmiri Pandits had a hope that now they would take serious steps to return home
 kendra sarkaar bhale hi sanjeeda ho, lekin rajya sarkaar kii ore se jo bayaan aa rahe hai, vah maamle ko pechida bana rahe hai
 Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed said, "I have told the Union Home Minister that if the Kashmiri Pandits want to come back, a separate colony will not be formed for them
 is par kendriya griharajya mantri kiran rigiju ne kaha ki raajnneetik partiyaan kuch bhi kahen, lekin ghati main sarkaar bijepi or pidipi kii he or ek ko duusare kii sunani padegi
 He was pointing towards Mufti Saheb
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki grih mantralay ne ek plan banaaya he ki kis tarah se kashmiri panditon ko waapas ghati main basaaya janaa he
 In fact, the Ministry of Home Affairs says that the government should get land for the special township of Pandits in the valley
 enbisisi is township kaa architekchar or dizine taiyaar kar chuki he
 Kashmiri Pandits will be given flats in 1000 apartments to be built in Srinagar, although local people will also be allowed to take flats in them
 udhar, ram madhav ne bhi twit kar kaha he ki kashmiri panditon ko basaane ke liye donon sarkarein vaada kar chuki hai
 This colony will be for Pandits only or for everyone, this is also an issue, but Kashmiri Pandits should also be consulted on this issue
 kashmir main dharmik ore saanskrithik vividhta ko banaae rakhana he to unhen izzat ke saath ghar waapas laana hoga
 In fact, the common minimum program of BJP and PDP in Jammu and Kashmir, there is also talk of resettling 62,000 Kashmiri Pandit families
 ye 62,000 kab tak lautenge, kahaan lautenge or kis tarah lautenge- ye ek bada sawaal he
 Omprakash Valmiki is a big name in Indian Dalit literature
 unke lekhan main sirf dalit vimarsh hi nahin, lekhan kii baarikiyaan or sahitya se sarokaar bhi maujuud he
 In his writings and literature, there is a useful compilation of his views on Dalit discourse and other issues, 'the Last Dialogue of Omprakash Valmiki
 ' yah pustak unase bhanvaralaal meena kii lambii baatcheet par aadhaarit he
 Meena works in the tribal region of Rajasthan
 kitaab main samaaj, jati or dharm se jude anek praasangik sawaal hai jinka valmiki ne taarkik evam bebaak jawaab diya he
 Actually, this book is not just a dialogue, but a transparent face of Dalit discourse in literature and the efforts of Dalit uplift in the society, in which their shortcomings and goodies are all clear
 khaas taur par dalit vimarsh kii baat kii jaae to valmiki ne puure itihaas ko hi khangalkar udhaaharan pesh kiye hai
 He has not only laid a firm finger on the omissions of big writers and readers, but has also suggested what should be right
 is lihaaj se kitaab or bhi vichaarneey ho jaati he
 Questions related to religion and caste have always been burning in our country
 shiksha ke itane vistaar ke baavjood gaanvon or shaharon main jatvaad kaayam he
 Elections are contested and won in the name of caste
 valmiki hamaare samaaj kii sanrachana evam soch se bhalee-bhaanti waakif the
 In this book, he has discussed different forms of casteism
 shaharon ke shikshit logon ke bich bhi jatvaad kii majboot jaden hai
 Even those who have lived abroad, they come to India and adopt the same attitude
 kis tarah sadiyon se chali aa rahi jativaadee vyavastha ab bhi logon ke man main kisi na kisi rup main jinda he- iske anek udhaaharan die hai
 Denying the class concept of Marxism, he says that caste is a social reality in India
 kai udhaaharan unhone ise sabit kiya he
 As an example, he says, 'jagjivan Ram had become the Deputy Prime Minister
 banaras uniwarsity main sampoornanand kii murti kaa udghaatan karne jate hai, jab udghaatan karke aa jate hai, tab us murti ko gangaajal se dhoyaa jaataa he
 
 
 Where is the class here and what is the basis of class? There are no classes in India, there is varna here
 jab tak varna nahin tuutegaa, varg nahin ban saktaa
 Indian Marxists are classist outside the home and pigeonhole inside the house
 'ye kuch itihaas se liye gaye udhaaharan hai lekin unhone bharat ke shaharon main vyaapt jati vyavastha ko darshaate hue kuch samakaleen udhaaharan bhi pesh kiye hai
 'what experience has he gained when he has come to a city like Delhi? When he goes to get a house for rent, he is asked for caste, when he calls himself a Dalit or ST, SC, he does not get a house
 ' jivan ke antim kshanon main baatcheet ke madhyam se samaaj kaa path pradarshan karne vaale vichaar dekar unhone apane pathakon or chintakon ko ek nayab tohfa diya he

 Delhi Police is running after buffaloes these days
 naa sirf bhaag rahi he balki dilli police ke 10 jawan 9 bhainson kii talash main din-raat tabele-tabele bhatak rahe hai
 It is reported that the commissioner has asked the policemen themselves to find 9 stolen buffaloes
 bhainson ko dhundne ke liye teen maheene se police ke jawan pareshaan hai
 Actually, the case is from Aman Vihar area of outer Delhi
 yahaan ek tabele se 9bhainson kii chorihui he
 Or rather, forcibly took the crooked buffalo from here
 maamla sirf bhainson kaa nahin balki pandrah lakh rupee kaa he
 How shocking this incident of buffalo theft of fifteen lakhs is in itself
 badmaashon ne bhainson ko diya nashe kaa injectiontabele ke maalik satish kumaar ke mutabik, 14-15 may kii raat kareeb dhai se teen baje ke bich uske tabele main 10-12 log danda lekar jabaran ghus aae
 They tied the servant's hands and feet and beat him badly and put him in a corner
 iske baad sabhi badmaashon ne bhainson ko injection lagaakar unhen nashe main kar diya taaki wo ghabaraakar idhar-udhar naa bhaagen
 The miscreants covered the buffaloes with cloth and ran them one by one into the truck and escaped
 satish ne bataaya ki badmaash uski 8 bhainsen or ek bhens kaa baccha le gaye
 Not only buffalo but assets of 15 lakhs have been recovered from Tabelle
 15 lakh kii bhainson kii chori kii ghatana police kamishnar bies bassi tak pahunchi
 After this, an order was issued from the headquarters of Delhi Police, after which the police started to sweat in search of 9 buffaloes
 100 bhainson kii tasviir whatrup parkareeb teen maheene ho chuke hai, lekin 9 main se ek bhi bhens kaa suraag tak nahin mil sakaa he
 Delhi Police has also taken whatsapp by taking pictures of 100 buffaloes
 lekin afsos inamen wo bhainsen nahin milin jo chori hui he
 Since the theft of buffaloes, Satish Kumar is financially in a bad shape
 jo kal tak deyari maalik tha, aaj wo majaburi main naukari kar rahaa he
 Satish says that the price of each buffalo stolen is 2
 50 lakh rupee he
 Two and a half lakh buffalo used to give 20 liters of milk
 deyari maalik ke mutabik, badmaash bhainson ko ek trek main le gaye
 The incident was reported to the police commissioner
 bassi ne nordarn range ke jwoint seepi sanjay singh ko maamla saunpa

 disipi ne bhainson kaa pataa lagane ke liye special team banaai
 10 fast-tracked jawans of Delhi Police were pressed into search for buffaloes
 2 inspector bhainson ko dhundne vaali team ko monitor kar rahe hai
 This case of buffalo theft is in the limelight in Delhi because for the first time this has happened, when the police of the country's capital have been troubled for three months in search of buffaloes and buffaloes do not know where they went missing

 Whereas in the last elections, the BJP won big in Haryana, Rajasthan, UP and Delhi
 dakshin ke rajyon main congress ko phaaydadakshin kshetra ke tahat andhra pradesh, karnataka, kerala, tamilnadu, telugana jaise rajya shaamil hai

 According to the Chinese police, the attacker's surname is Zhao and he is around 28 years old

 This horrific incident occurred when the children of Mizzi County No

 Among the children killed in the attack are 7 girls

 In March 2015, three persons were sentenced to death for killing 29 people and injuring more than 100 people, near Kunming station
 aisa lagata he ki bhagwaan hanuman sachche rashtriya devtaa hai
 Rather say that there are global gods
 jis tarah un par daawey thoke ja rahe hai, ab to sirf unka yahudee or isai bananaa shesh rah gaya he
 i do not know if any Maithil has claimed him, but according to the manner in which Sita considered him a son, he may have been born in a village in Mithila

 a brother from Ranchi said that Hanuman's mother lived on a hill nearby
 andhra pradesh ke ek telegu mitra kaa kahana he ki pracheen kiskindha nagari andhra pradesh main he to ve telegu hue
 On the other hand, according to the spiritual guru Jaggi Vasudev, Hanuman must have been Tamil because Rama conquered Lanka with the help of Tamils
 tabhi se ye lanka vaale tamilon ke virdohi ho gaye!saahitiyik patrika 'hans' ke sampadak or vidwaan divangat rajendra yadav ne shaayad kisi lekh main hanuman ko itihaas kaa pehla aatankwaadi kaha tha, kyonki hanuman ne lanka jaise ek samprabhu rajya main jaakar todphod kii thi, ‘sabotage’ kiya tha
 It seems that the LTTE had used courage like suicide bombing to take inspiration from Hanuman itself
 vasudev or yadav yahaan ek bindu par sahamat najar aate hai: ye littey vaale hanuman ke hi anuyaayi hai!purvottar se ek mitra ne daawa kiya he ki ve sambhavat: nagaland yaa mizoram ke the
 Why? Because the next one is Thailand, Indonesia
 pakkaa mizoram se gaye honge
 Hanumanji, however, proved to be better than the cow in political terms
 un par hue vivaad main abhi tak koi linching nahin hui
 The verbal game continued
 balki kahie ki ve sarvadharm-sadbhaav ke pratik banakar ubhare
 People of many religions rejected him
 haal main hanumanji kii lokapriyata ke maamle main shani dev se kadi takkar mili thi
 The idols of Shanidev were giving a tough competition to Hanuman
 darasal, shani ko hindu jyotish shaastra main nyaay kaa devtaa mana jaataa he yani nir-ksheer-vivek vaala
 God of the poor, the afflicted and the neglected
 aap chahen to devataaon main communist (asli vaale!) bhi kah sakate hai
 They are rebellious, perpetual 'rebels'
 unhone apni maa ke paksh main pita surya se jhagada kar liya
 Befriended rahu-ketu against the Sun and created an uproar in the Sun's empire
 kaale-bhujang hai hin (ise naslbhedi tippanee na mana jaae)
 Black color became a symbol of 'protest' anyway
 commeredon kaa kaala kapadaa pahanakar or kaale rang ke dwaara virodh-pradarshan yaad kiijie
 Our Saturn is right there
 duusari baat, shani ko udyog-dhandha, udhyam, shram, loha-lakkad ityadi kaa devtaa bhi mana jaataa he
 That is, wherever there are workers, machines, the importance of Saturn will increase
 bharat ke nakshe par audyogic ilaakon main shani kaa jalawaa kaaphi majboot hua he
 Hanumanji used to dominate earlier
 angreji raaj main jo girmitiyaa banakar bagan shramik yaa railway line bichaane morishas yaa dakshin africa gaye the, unke bich bajrangbali kaa jalawaa tha
 But here Saturn's respect has increased in factories and even in software parks in California
 isse ye bhi sabit hota he ki shani louh yug ke baad ke devtaa hai, jabaki hanuman pashaan yug ke
 From the colonial point of view and from the view of white-blacks, Saturn became deity to blacks, and since Hanuman is 'lal-deh-lali Lassai', then there were children of the house eating and drinking who have become communists
 yani aap chahen to ‘left-libral’ kah lijie
 The red langot and the vermilion grandson they seem full revolutionary
 deal mekar bhi hai
 The agreement between Sugriva and Ram was made by him - Goya Jyoti Basu and Rajiv Gandhi's agreement! Hanuman is a deal maker, is close to the ruling class, is intelligent (remember the supremacy of left-liberals on editorial pages) and is also a fighter
 kaandhe munj “janeu” saaje
 
 
 After reading, it seems like a Brahmin comrade deeply rooted in the CPI-M! Our left-brother-in-law was still far away from Hanuman
 pehle hi apana lenaa chahie tha
 What a wonderful match between Lal Salaam and lal-diapers
 lokapriyata or sweekaaryata bhi bad jaati jiske liye ve halkaan rahete hai
 In religious stories, Hanuman also once helped Shani immensely
 ravan ne jab shani ko baandh diya tha to lanka dahan ke vakt hanuman hi gadhe vakt par kaam aae the
 Before that they had swallowed the sun as a fruit
 surya kaa darp-daman kiya jaise krishna ne govardhan uthaakar devraj indra kaa kiya tha
 Every symbol of resistance is present in our religion
 isliye har shani mandir main saamne bajrangbali hai
 Shani gives heavy relief to Hanuman devotees
 kul milakar janata ke man main bhaavana he ki hanuman, shani par bees tehre
 It is said that Hanuman was an incarnation of Rudra (ie Mahadev!) And Mahadev is also popular in all India
 unhen bhi kisi ek jati-sampradaay main baandha nahin ja saktaa
 Is the south strong? Their TRP is tremendous everywhere
 shaayad hanuman par itane daawey hone kii ek vajah ye bhi ho
 Overall, Hanuman has emerged as a big source of unity in this divisive time
 hamen chahie ki ham ise celibratt karen or ho sake to murti nirmaan ke is saghan yug main sanyukt raashtra sangh ke mukhyalay main hanuman kii ek viraat murti sthapit karne kaa abhiyaan chalaaen jo karolbaag vaale hanuman ko takkar detii ho

 saatvaan vetan ayog (7TH Pay Commission) karmchaariyon ke jitani khushiyaan lekar aayaa utani hi duvidhaon ke saath bhi kendriya karmchaariyon ko gher diya
 Since its implementation, employees expressed their displeasure over many issues
 nunatam vetan maan se lekar kai alouns tak ke muddon par karmchaariyon kii naaraazgi ko dekhte hue sarkaar ne samiti banaakar uskaa hal nikaalane kii koshish kii
 In three committees, one committee was formed with regard to allowances
 vitt sachiv ashok lavasa kii adhyakshata main banaai gai is samiti kii ab tak kareeb 15 baithken hui or 6 taarikh ko is samiti main karmchaariyon kii ore se unke pratinidhi or sarkaar ke pratinidhiyon ke bich antim daur kii baatcheet bhi samaapt ho gai
 Convener of NCJCM, a union of employees' organizations, Shiv Gopal Mishra told NDTV that the final round meeting of the Allowance Committee was held on Thursday, after which no further discussion on the issue will take place
 mishra ne enditivi ko bataaya ki yah samiti ab do-chaar din main apni report cabinet ko saunp degi
 It is also believed that this report can be presented in the cabinet meeting to be held next week
 is baithak main nirnay hone ke baad kendriya karmchaariyon ke liye koi acchhee khabar aa sakati he
 It is noteworthy that the report of the committees should have come in four months but the central employees are angry due to the delay
 is sambandh main karmchaariyon ke netaa shiv gopal mishra ne cabinet sachiv se mulaakaat bhi kii thi or sarkaar ko karmchaariyon kii bhaawanaaon se avgat karaayaa tha
 Shiv Gopal Mishra had earlier told that the Railway Minister was also met on the 3rd
 is baithak main bhi railway karmchaariyon kii alouns, minimum veg or fitment formula, enpies or pension ko lekar baari rosh ke bare main railmantri sahit anya bade adhikariyon ko jaankaree di gai thi
 Let me tell you that there is confusion about many allowances given to the Central Employees by the 7th Pay Commission
 narendra modi sarkaar ne 2016 main saatven vetan ayog (seventh Pay Commission) kii siforeeshon ko manjuuri di thi or 1 janvari 2016 se 7wein vetan ayog kii report ko lagu kiya tha
 However, due to disagreement on several issues with allowances, these recommendations were not fully implemented
 jaankaree ke liye bataa den ki saatvaan vetan ayog se pehle kendriya karmchaaree 196 kism ke alounces ke hakdaar the
 But the Seventh Pay Commission abolished or merged many allowances, leaving only 55 allowances left
 tamaam karmchaariyon ko kai alouns samaapt hone kaa malaal he
 Because many allowances have not been implemented yet and the employees have not received their direct benefits, the employees feel that the Pay Commission report is not yet implemented
 ab tak 7wein vetan ayog kii siforeeshon ko lekar karmchaariyon kii naaraazgi ke baad uthe sawaalon ke samaadhaan ke liye sarkaar kii ore se teen samitiyon ke gathan kaa elaan kiya gaya tha
 In the report of the Seventh Pay Commission, a committee was formed on the dispute regarding allowance, the second committee was on the issue of pension and the third committee was made about the alleged discrepancies in the pay scale
 sabase ahm samiti visangatiyon ko lekar banaai gai he
 This anomaly committee has been named
 isi samiti ke paas nunatam vetanman kaa mudda bhi he
 This third committee also has the issue of minimum pay scale of the fourth category employees
 yahi samiti nunatam vetanman ko badhaane kii maang karne vaale karmchaaree sanghathanon se baat kar rahi he
 This committee has been formed under the chairmanship of the Finance Secretary
 samiti main chah mantralayon ke sachiv shaamil hai
 It is noteworthy that the employees' organization has demanded that the HRA should be decided on the basis of the old formula
 sanghathan ne sachivon kii samiti se kaha he ki transport alouns ko mahangaai ke hisaab se reshnalise kiya jaye
 The organization has demanded from the government that the allowance given for the education of children should be kept at least Rs 3000
 sanghathan ne medical alouns kii rakam bhi 2000 rupee karne kii maang kii he
 The organization has also asked the government to revisit several allowances which the Seventh Pay Commission has abolished
 mana ja rahaa he ki sarkaar ne transport alouns (yatra bhatta) ko do bhaagon main baanta he
 One is the CCA and the other is the TA given as undone
 yah paanchaven vetan ayog kii bhaanti dey hoga, aisa mana ja rahaa he
 It is also being said that they will be separated from DA and this fix will be fixed at slab rate
 sabase ahm sawaal ab bhi bana hua he ki sarkaar ne echaare ko kab se dene kii baat ko sweekaar kiya he
 This question is still haunting the employees
 kya yah dar 1
 1
 16 se lagu kii gai he yaa phir 1
 4
 17 se yah lagu hogi
 As far as the employees are concerned, they have been demanding to implement it since January last year and some time ago there was a hint from the government that all the disputed allowances will be implemented from 1 April 2017
 jaankaree ke liye bataa den ki karmchaariyon kii maang he ki echaare ko puraane formule ke aadhaar par tay kiya jaae yaa phir isaki dar badhaai jaae
 Central employees say that currently HRA employees are getting less than earlier as per the fixed formula
 bataa den ki saatven vetan ayog (seventh Pay Commission) dwaara kendriya karmchaariyon ko die jane vaale kai bhatton ko lekar asamanjas kii sthiti he
 The Narendra Modi government had approved the recommendations of the 7th Pay Commission in 2016 and implemented the 7th Pay Commission report from 1 January 2016
 lekin, bhatton ke saath kai muddon par asahmati hone kii vajah se in siforishein puri tarah se lagu nahin ho pain
 It is being said that the officials authorized to negotiate on behalf of the government have agreed to raise the HRA to 1 level, now the HRA can be up to 30%, 20% and 10%
 vahiin, vishwasaneey sutron ke hawaale se khabar mil rahi he ki bade shaharon main ise 30 pratishat kiya ja saktaa he, lekin yah abhi tay nahin he
 The employees' organization has said that if the government has not increased the HRA, how can it be reduced
 apane tark ke samarthan main karmchaariyan kii daleel he ki kya shaharon main makaan kaa kiraaya kam hua he
 Have houses become cheap? jab yah nahin hua he to sarkaar apane karmchaariyon ke saath anyaay kaise kar sakati he
 Explain that in its report, the Pay Commission had initially fixed the HRA at 24%, 16% and 8% and stated that when the DA reaches 50 percent it will be 27%, 18% and 9%
 Will be respectively
 itnaa hi nahin vetan ayog (pe kamishan) ne yah bhi kaha tha ki jab die 100% ho jayega tab yah dar 30%, 20% or 10% kramash : eks, vaai or jed shaharon ke liye ho jaaegi
 It is noteworthy that in the memorandum related to their demand before the pay commission constituted by the joint organization of employees, NJCA asked for this rate to be 60%, 40% and 20% respectively
 sanghathan kaa aarope he ki ayog ne karmchaariyon kii maang ko puri tarah se thukraa diya tha
 He says that the Pay Commission has reduced this rate from the Sixth Pay Commission
 inkaa kahana he ki kyonki ise die ke saath joda gaya he to yah tabhi badhegaa jab die kii dar tay pratishat tak bad jaaegi
 The comments jaankaree ke liye bataa den ki saatvaan vetan ayog se pehle kendriya karmchaaree 196 kism ke alounces ke hakdaar the
 But the Seventh Pay Commission abolished or merged many allowances, leaving only 55 allowances left
 tamaam karmchaariyon ko kai alouns samaapt hone kaa malaal he
 Because many allowances have not been implemented yet and the employees have not received their direct benefits, the employees feel that the Pay Commission report is not yet implemented
 bataa den ki saatven vetan ayog kii report se karmchaariyon kii kai shikaayatein rahi hai or aise main centre kii narendra modi sarkaar ne apane karmchaariyon kii shikayaton ko dur karne ke liye sambandhit mantralay or vittamantralay ke adheen samitiyon kaa gathan kiya he
 These committees are talking to the staff leaders and these committees had to give their decision to the government in four months, but so far only the final committee meeting has been held
 karmchaaree sanghathanon ke sanyukt sangh ensigesiem ke sanyojak shiv gopal mishra ne enditivi ko bataaya ki guuruuvaar ko alouns samiti kii antim daur kii baithak hui jiske baad is mudde par ab aage or baatcheet nahin hogi
 Mishra told NDTV that this committee will now submit its report to the cabinet in two-four days
 mana yah bhi ja rahaa he ki agle saptaah hone vaali cabinet kii baithak main yah report prastut ho sakati he
 After the decision in this meeting can come any good news for the central employees
 ullekhanayi he ki samitiyon kii report chaar maheenon main aa jaani chahie thi lekin deree ke kaaran kendriya karmchaaree naaraaz hai
 Staff leader Shiv Gopal Mishra had also met the Cabinet Secretary in this regard and informed the government about the feelings of the employees
 shiv gopal mishra ne pehle bataaya tha ki teen taarikh ko bhi railmantri se mulaakaat kii gai thi
 In this meeting also, information was given to the Railway Minister and other top officials about the huge anger against the railway employees' allowance, minimum wage and fitment formula, NPS and pension
 bataa den ki saatven vetan ayog (7th Pay Commission) dwaara kendriya karmchaariyon ko die jane vaale kai bhatton ko lekar asamanjas kii sthiti he
 The Narendra Modi government had approved the recommendations of the Seventh Pay Commission in 2016 and implemented the 7th Pay Commission report from 1 January 2016
 lekin, bhatton ke saath kai muddon par asahmati hone kii vajah se in siforishein puri tarah se lagu nahin ho pain
 For information, let us know that before the Seventh Pay Commission, central employees were entitled to 196 types of allowances
 lekin saatven vetan ayog ne kai alounces ko samaapt kar diya yaa phir unhen mila diya jiske baad keval 55 alouns baaki rah gaye
 Many employees are sorry for ending many allowances
 kyonki kai alouns abhi tak lagu nahin hue or karmchaariyon ko uskaa sidhaa laabh nahin mila he to karmchaariyon ko lag rahaa he ki vetan ayog kii report abhi lagu nahin hui
 Till now, the government had announced the formation of three committees to resolve the questions raised after the employees' displeasure over the recommendations of the 7th Pay Commission
 saatven vetan ayog kii report main alouns ko lekar hue vivaad se judi ek samiti, duusari samiti pension ko lekar or teesri samiti vetanman main kathith visangatiyon ko lekar banaai gai thi
 The most important committee is formed with discrepancies
 is anomali samiti kaa naam diya gaya he
 The same committee also has the issue of minimum pay scale
 chaturth shreniyon ke karmchaariyon ke nunatam vetanman kaa mudda bhi is teesri samiti kaa paas he
 The same committee is talking to employee organizations seeking to raise the minimum pay scale
 vitt sachiv kii adhyakshata main is samiti kaa gathan kiya gaya he
 The committee consists of secretaries from six ministries
 ullekhneey he ki karmchaariyon kii ore karmchaaree sanghathan ne maang kii he ki echaare ko puraane formule ke aadhaar par tay kiya jaae
 The organization has asked the committee of secretaries that the transport allowance be revised according to inflation
 sanghathan ne sarkaar se yah maang kii he ki bacchon kii shiksha ke liye diya jane vaale alouns ko kam se kam 3000 rupee rakhaa jaae
 The organization has also demanded a medical allowance of Rs 2000
 sanghathan ne sarkaar se yah bhi kaha he ki kai alouns jo saatven vetan ayog ne samaapt kiye hai unpar punarvichaar kiya jaae
 It is believed that the government has divided the Transport Allowance (traveling Allowance) into two parts
 ek sisie or doosraa purvavat kii tarah diya jane vaala tie he
 It is believed that this will be payable like the Fifth Pay Commission
 yah bhi kaha ja rahaa he ki inako die se alag kar diya jayega or yah fiks slab rate par tay hoga
 The most important question still remains as to how long the government has agreed to give the HRA
 yah prashn abhi bhi karmchaariyon ko sata rahaa he
 Does this rate 1
 1
 16 or 1 is applied
 4
 With effect from 17, it will be applicable
 jahaan tak karmchaariyon kaa sawaal he vah ise pichley saal janvari se lagu karwaane kii maang karte rahe hai or sarkaar kii ore se kuch samay pehle aisa ishaara mila tha ki sabhi vivaadit alouns ko 1 april 2017 se lagu kiya jayega
 For information, let us tell that the demand of employees is that HRA should be decided on the basis of the old formula or its rate should be increased
 kendriya karmchaariyon kaa kahana he ki vartmaan main tay formula ke hisaab se echaare karmchaariyon ko pehle kii tulana main kam milane laga he
 Let me tell you that there is confusion about many allowances given to the Central Employees by the Seventh Pay Commission
 narendra modi sarkaar ne 2016 main saatven vetan ayog (7th Pay Commission) kii siforeeshon ko manjuuri di thi or 1 janvari 2016 se 7wein vetan ayog kii report ko lagu kiya tha
 However, due to disagreement on several issues with allowances, these recommendations were not fully implemented
 kaha ja rahaa he ki sarkaar kii ore se baatcheet ke liye adhikrut adhikari echaare ko 1 str upar karne ko taiyaar hue hai ab echaare 30%, 20% or 10% tak ho saktaa he
 At the same time, reports are being received from reliable sources that 30 percent can be done in big cities, but it is not decided yet
 karmchaaree sanghathan kaa kahana rahaa he ki agar sarkaar ne echaare badhaayaa nahin he to gata kaise sakati hai
 In support of their argument, the workers argue that the rent of the house has come down in the cities
 kya makaan saste ho gaye hai
 When this has not happened how can the government do injustice to its employees
 bataa den ki vetan ayog (pe kamishan) ne apni report main echaare ko aarambh main 24%, 16% or 8% tay kiya tha or kaha gaya tha ki jab die 50 pratishat tak pahunch jayega to yah 27%, 18% or 9% kramash: ho jayega
 Not only this, the Pay Commission had also said that when DA becomes 100%, then the rate will be 30%, 20% and 10% for X, y and z cities respectively
 ullekhneey he ki karmchaariyon ke sanyukt sanghathan enzesie ne gathit vetan ayog ke samaksh apni maang se sambandhit gyaapan main is dar ko kramash: 60%, 40% or 20% karne ke liye kaha tha
 The organization alleges that the commission completely rejected the employees' demand
 unka kahana he ki vetan ayog ne is rate ko chathe vetan ayog se bhi kam kar diya he
 They say that because it is combined with DA, it will increase only when the DA rate increases by a fixed percentage
 tippaniyan For information, let us know that before the Seventh Pay Commission, central employees were entitled to 196 types of allowances
 lekin saatven vetan ayog ne kai alounces ko samaapt kar diya yaa phir unhen mila diya jiske baad keval 55 alouns baaki rah gaye
 Many employees are sorry for ending many allowances
 kyonki kai alouns abhi tak lagu nahin hue or karmchaariyon ko uskaa sidhaa laabh nahin mila he to karmchaariyon ko lag rahaa he ki vetan ayog kii report abhi lagu nahin hui
 Explain that there have been many complaints of employees from the report of the Seventh Pay Commission and in such a situation the Narendra Modi government of the Center has set up committees under the concerned Ministry and Ministry of Finance to address the grievances of its employees
 ye samitiyaan karmchaaree netaaon se baat kar rahi hai or is samitiyon ko apana faisla chaar maheene main sarkaar ko dena tha lekin abhi tak keval alouns samiti kii hi antim baithak hui he
 It is noteworthy that the report of the committees should have come in four months but the central employees are angry due to the delay
 is sambandh main karmchaariyon ke netaa shiv gopal mishra ne cabinet sachiv se mulaakaat bhi kii thi or sarkaar ko karmchaariyon kii bhaawanaaon se avgat karaayaa tha

 It is noteworthy that the employees' organization has demanded that the HRA should be decided on the basis of the old formula
 sanghathan ne sachivon kii samiti se kaha he ki transport alouns ko mahangaai ke hisaab se reshnalise kiya jaye
 The organization has demanded from the government that the allowance given for the education of children should be kept at least Rs 3000
 sanghathan ne medical alouns kii rakam bhi 2000 rupee karne kii maang kii he
 The organization has also asked the government to revisit several allowances which the Seventh Pay Commission has abolished

 One is the CCA and the other is the TA given as undone
 yah paanchaven vetan ayog kii bhaanti dey hoga, aisa mana ja rahaa he
 It is also being said that they will be separated from DA and this fix will be fixed at slab rate
 sabase ahm sawaal ab bhi bana hua he ki sarkaar ne echaare ko kab se dene kii baat ko sweekaar kiya he
 This question is still haunting the employees

 As far as the employees are concerned, they have been demanding to implement it since January last year and some time ago there was a hint from the government that all the disputed allowances will be implemented from 1 April 2017
 jaankaree ke liye bataa den ki karmchaariyon kii maang he ki echaare ko puraane formule ke aadhaar par tay kiya jaae yaa phir isaki dar badhaai jaae
 Central employees say that currently HRA employees are getting less than earlier as per the fixed formula
 bataa den ki saatven vetan ayog (seventh Pay Commission) dwaara kendriya karmchaariyon ko die jane vaale kai bhatton ko lekar asamanjas kii sthiti he
 The Narendra Modi government had approved the recommendations of the 7th Pay Commission in 2016 and implemented the 7th Pay Commission report from 1 January 2016
 lekin, bhatton ke saath kai muddon par asahmati hone kii vajah se in siforishein puri tarah se lagu nahin ho pain
 It is being said that the officials authorized to negotiate on behalf of the government have agreed to raise the HRA to 1 level, now the HRA can be up to 30%, 20% and 10%
 vahiin, vishwasaneey sutron ke hawaale se khabar mil rahi he ki bade shaharon main ise 30 pratishat kiya ja saktaa he, lekin yah abhi tay nahin he
 The employees' organization has said that if the government has not increased the HRA, how can it be reduced
 apane tark ke samarthan main karmchaariyan kii daleel he ki kya shaharon main makaan kaa kiraaya kam hua he
 Have houses become cheap? jab yah nahin hua he to sarkaar apane karmchaariyon ke saath anyaay kaise kar sakati he
 Explain that in its report, the Pay Commission had initially fixed the HRA at 24%, 16% and 8% and stated that when the DA reaches 50 percent it will be 27%, 18% and 9%
 Will be respectively
 itnaa hi nahin vetan ayog (pe kamishan) ne yah bhi kaha tha ki jab die 100% ho jayega tab yah dar 30%, 20% or 10% kramash : eks, vaai or jed shaharon ke liye ho jaaegi
 It is noteworthy that in the memorandum related to their demand before the pay commission constituted by the joint organization of employees, NJCA asked for this rate to be 60%, 40% and 20% respectively
 sanghathan kaa aarope he ki ayog ne karmchaariyon kii maang ko puri tarah se thukraa diya tha
 He says that the Pay Commission has reduced this rate from the Sixth Pay Commission
 inkaa kahana he ki kyonki ise die ke saath joda gaya he to yah tabhi badhegaa jab die kii dar tay pratishat tak bad jaaegi
 The comments jaankaree ke liye bataa den ki saatvaan vetan ayog se pehle kendriya karmchaaree 196 kism ke alounces ke hakdaar the
 But the Seventh Pay Commission abolished or merged many allowances, leaving only 55 allowances left
 tamaam karmchaariyon ko kai alouns samaapt hone kaa malaal he
 Because many allowances have not been implemented yet and the employees have not received their direct benefits, the employees feel that the Pay Commission report is not yet implemented
 bataa den ki saatven vetan ayog kii report se karmchaariyon kii kai shikaayatein rahi hai or aise main centre kii narendra modi sarkaar ne apane karmchaariyon kii shikayaton ko dur karne ke liye sambandhit mantralay or vittamantralay ke adheen samitiyon kaa gathan kiya he
 These committees are talking to the staff leaders and these committees had to give their decision to the government in four months, but so far only the final committee meeting has been held
 shiv gopal mishra ne pehle bataaya tha ki teen taarikh ko bhi railmantri se mulaakaat kii gai thi
 In this meeting also, information was given to the Railway Minister and other top officials about the huge anger against the railway employees' allowance, minimum wage and fitment formula, NPS and pension
 bataa den ki saatven vetan ayog (7th Pay Commission) dwaara kendriya karmchaariyon ko die jane vaale kai bhatton ko lekar asamanjas kii sthiti he
 The Narendra Modi government had approved the recommendations of the Seventh Pay Commission in 2016 and implemented the 7th Pay Commission report from 1 January 2016
 lekin, bhatton ke saath kai muddon par asahmati hone kii vajah se in siforishein puri tarah se lagu nahin ho pain
 For information, let us know that before the Seventh Pay Commission, central employees were entitled to 196 types of allowances
 lekin saatven vetan ayog ne kai alounces ko samaapt kar diya yaa phir unhen mila diya jiske baad keval 55 alouns baaki rah gaye
 Many employees are sorry for ending many allowances
 kyonki kai alouns abhi tak lagu nahin hue or karmchaariyon ko uskaa sidhaa laabh nahin mila he to karmchaariyon ko lag rahaa he ki vetan ayog kii report abhi lagu nahin hui
 Till now, the government had announced the formation of three committees to resolve the questions raised after the employees' displeasure over the recommendations of the 7th Pay Commission
 saatven vetan ayog kii report main alouns ko lekar hue vivaad se judi ek samiti, duusari samiti pension ko lekar or teesri samiti vetanman main kathith visangatiyon ko lekar banaai gai thi
 The most important committee is formed with discrepancies
 is anomali samiti kaa naam diya gaya he
 The same committee also has the issue of minimum pay scale
 chaturth shreniyon ke karmchaariyon ke nunatam vetanman kaa mudda bhi is teesri samiti kaa paas he
 The same committee is talking to employee organizations seeking to raise the minimum pay scale
 vitt sachiv kii adhyakshata main is samiti kaa gathan kiya gaya he
 The committee consists of secretaries from six ministries
 ullekhneey he ki karmchaariyon kii ore karmchaaree sanghathan ne maang kii he ki echaare ko puraane formule ke aadhaar par tay kiya jaae
 The organization has asked the committee of secretaries that the transport allowance be revised according to inflation
 sanghathan ne sarkaar se yah maang kii he ki bacchon kii shiksha ke liye diya jane vaale alouns ko kam se kam 3000 rupee rakhaa jaae
 The organization has also demanded a medical allowance of Rs 2000
 sanghathan ne sarkaar se yah bhi kaha he ki kai alouns jo saatven vetan ayog ne samaapt kiye hai unpar punarvichaar kiya jaae
 It is believed that the government has divided the Transport Allowance (traveling Allowance) into two parts
 ek sisie or doosraa purvavat kii tarah diya jane vaala tie he
 It is believed that this will be payable like the Fifth Pay Commission
 yah bhi kaha ja rahaa he ki inako die se alag kar diya jayega or yah fiks slab rate par tay hoga
 The most important question still remains as to how long the government has agreed to give the HRA
 yah prashn abhi bhi karmchaariyon ko sata rahaa he
 Does this rate 1
 1
 16 or 1 is applied
 4
 With effect from 17, it will be applicable
 jahaan tak karmchaariyon kaa sawaal he vah ise pichley saal janvari se lagu karwaane kii maang karte rahe hai or sarkaar kii ore se kuch samay pehle aisa ishaara mila tha ki sabhi vivaadit alouns ko 1 april 2017 se lagu kiya jayega
 For information, let us tell that the demand of employees is that HRA should be decided on the basis of the old formula or its rate should be increased
 kendriya karmchaariyon kaa kahana he ki vartmaan main tay formula ke hisaab se echaare karmchaariyon ko pehle kii tulana main kam milane laga he
 Let me tell you that there is confusion about many allowances given to the Central Employees by the Seventh Pay Commission
 narendra modi sarkaar ne 2016 main saatven vetan ayog (7th Pay Commission) kii siforeeshon ko manjuuri di thi or 1 janvari 2016 se 7wein vetan ayog kii report ko lagu kiya tha
 However, due to disagreement on several issues with allowances, these recommendations were not fully implemented
 kaha ja rahaa he ki sarkaar kii ore se baatcheet ke liye adhikrut adhikari echaare ko 1 str upar karne ko taiyaar hue hai ab echaare 30%, 20% or 10% tak ho saktaa he
 At the same time, reports are being received from reliable sources that 30 percent can be done in big cities, but it is not decided yet
 karmchaaree sanghathan kaa kahana rahaa he ki agar sarkaar ne echaare badhaayaa nahin he to gata kaise sakati hai
 In support of their argument, the workers argue that the rent of the house has come down in the cities
 kya makaan saste ho gaye hai
 When this has not happened how can the government do injustice to its employees
 bataa den ki vetan ayog (pe kamishan) ne apni report main echaare ko aarambh main 24%, 16% or 8% tay kiya tha or kaha gaya tha ki jab die 50 pratishat tak pahunch jayega to yah 27%, 18% or 9% kramash: ho jayega
 Not only this, the Pay Commission had also said that when DA becomes 100%, then the rate will be 30%, 20% and 10% for X, y and z cities respectively
 ullekhneey he ki karmchaariyon ke sanyukt sanghathan enzesie ne gathit vetan ayog ke samaksh apni maang se sambandhit gyaapan main is dar ko kramash: 60%, 40% or 20% karne ke liye kaha tha
 The organization alleges that the commission completely rejected the employees' demand
 unka kahana he ki vetan ayog ne is rate ko chathe vetan ayog se bhi kam kar diya he
 They say that because it is combined with DA, it will increase only when the DA rate increases by a fixed percentage
 tippaniyan For information, let us know that before the Seventh Pay Commission, central employees were entitled to 196 types of allowances
 lekin saatven vetan ayog ne kai alounces ko samaapt kar diya yaa phir unhen mila diya jiske baad keval 55 alouns baaki rah gaye

 kyonki kai alouns abhi tak lagu nahin hue or karmchaariyon ko uskaa sidhaa laabh nahin mila he to karmchaariyon ko lag rahaa he ki vetan ayog kii report abhi lagu nahin hui
 Explain that there have been many complaints of employees from the report of the Seventh Pay Commission and in such a situation the Narendra Modi government of the Center has set up committees under the concerned Ministry and Ministry of Finance to address the grievances of its employees
 ye samitiyaan karmchaaree netaaon se baat kar rahi hai or is samitiyon ko apana faisla chaar maheene main sarkaar ko dena tha lekin abhi tak keval alouns samiti kii hi antim baithak hui he

 In the report of the Seventh Pay Commission, a committee was formed on the dispute regarding allowance, the second committee was on the issue of pension and the third committee was made about the alleged discrepancies in the pay scale
 sabase ahm samiti visangatiyon ko lekar banaai gai he
 This anomaly committee has been named

 sanghathan ne sachivon kii samiti se kaha he ki transport alouns ko mahangaai ke hisaab se reshnalise kiya jaye
 The organization has demanded from the government that the allowance given for the education of children should be kept at least Rs 3000
 sanghathan ne medical alouns kii rakam bhi 2000 rupee karne kii maang kii he
 The organization has also asked the government to revisit several allowances which the Seventh Pay Commission has abolished
 mana ja rahaa he ki sarkaar ne transport alouns (yatra bhatta) ko do bhaagon main baanta he
 One is the CCA and the other is the TA given as undone
 yah paanchaven vetan ayog kii bhaanti dey hoga, aisa mana ja rahaa he
 It is also being said that they will be separated from DA and this fix will be fixed at slab rate
 sabase ahm sawaal ab bhi bana hua he ki sarkaar ne echaare ko kab se dene kii baat ko sweekaar kiya he
 This question is still haunting the employees
 kya yah dar 1
 1
 16 se lagu kii gai he yaa phir 1
 4
 17 se yah lagu hogi
 As far as the employees are concerned, they have been demanding to implement it since January last year and some time ago there was a hint from the government that all the disputed allowances will be implemented from 1 April 2017
 jaankaree ke liye bataa den ki karmchaariyon kii maang he ki echaare ko puraane formule ke aadhaar par tay kiya jaae yaa phir isaki dar badhaai jaae
 Central employees say that currently HRA employees are getting less than earlier as per the fixed formula
 bataa den ki saatven vetan ayog (seventh Pay Commission) dwaara kendriya karmchaariyon ko die jane vaale kai bhatton ko lekar asamanjas kii sthiti he
 The Narendra Modi government had approved the recommendations of the 7th Pay Commission in 2016 and implemented the 7th Pay Commission report from 1 January 2016
 lekin, bhatton ke saath kai muddon par asahmati hone kii vajah se in siforishein puri tarah se lagu nahin ho pain
 It is being said that the officials authorized to negotiate on behalf of the government have agreed to raise the HRA to 1 level, now the HRA can be up to 30%, 20% and 10%
 vahiin, vishwasaneey sutron ke hawaale se khabar mil rahi he ki bade shaharon main ise 30 pratishat kiya ja saktaa he, lekin yah abhi tay nahin he
 The employees' organization has said that if the government has not increased the HRA, how can it be reduced
 apane tark ke samarthan main karmchaariyan kii daleel he ki kya shaharon main makaan kaa kiraaya kam hua he
 Have houses become cheap? jab yah nahin hua he to sarkaar apane karmchaariyon ke saath anyaay kaise kar sakati he
 Explain that in its report, the Pay Commission had initially fixed the HRA at 24%, 16% and 8% and stated that when the DA reaches 50 percent it will be 27%, 18% and 9%
 Will be respectively
 itnaa hi nahin vetan ayog (pe kamishan) ne yah bhi kaha tha ki jab die 100% ho jayega tab yah dar 30%, 20% or 10% kramash : eks, vaai or jed shaharon ke liye ho jaaegi
 It is noteworthy that in the memorandum related to their demand before the pay commission constituted by the joint organization of employees, NJCA asked for this rate to be 60%, 40% and 20% respectively
 sanghathan kaa aarope he ki ayog ne karmchaariyon kii maang ko puri tarah se thukraa diya tha
 He says that the Pay Commission has reduced this rate from the Sixth Pay Commission
 inkaa kahana he ki kyonki ise die ke saath joda gaya he to yah tabhi badhegaa jab die kii dar tay pratishat tak bad jaaegi
 The comments jaankaree ke liye bataa den ki saatvaan vetan ayog se pehle kendriya karmchaaree 196 kism ke alounces ke hakdaar the
 But the Seventh Pay Commission abolished or merged many allowances, leaving only 55 allowances left
 tamaam karmchaariyon ko kai alouns samaapt hone kaa malaal he
 Because many allowances have not been implemented yet and the employees have not received their direct benefits, the employees feel that the Pay Commission report is not yet implemented
 bataa den ki saatven vetan ayog kii report se karmchaariyon kii kai shikaayatein rahi hai or aise main centre kii narendra modi sarkaar ne apane karmchaariyon kii shikayaton ko dur karne ke liye sambandhit mantralay or vittamantralay ke adheen samitiyon kaa gathan kiya he
 These committees are talking to the staff leaders and these committees had to give their decision to the government in four months, but so far only the final committee meeting has been held
 ullekhneey he ki karmchaariyon kii ore karmchaaree sanghathan ne maang kii he ki echaare ko puraane formule ke aadhaar par tay kiya jaae
 The organization has asked the committee of secretaries that the transport allowance be revised according to inflation
 sanghathan ne sarkaar se yah maang kii he ki bacchon kii shiksha ke liye diya jane vaale alouns ko kam se kam 3000 rupee rakhaa jaae
 The organization has also demanded a medical allowance of Rs 2000
 sanghathan ne sarkaar se yah bhi kaha he ki kai alouns jo saatven vetan ayog ne samaapt kiye hai unpar punarvichaar kiya jaae
 It is believed that the government has divided the Transport Allowance (traveling Allowance) into two parts
 ek sisie or doosraa purvavat kii tarah diya jane vaala tie he
 It is believed that this will be payable like the Fifth Pay Commission
 yah bhi kaha ja rahaa he ki inako die se alag kar diya jayega or yah fiks slab rate par tay hoga
 The most important question still remains as to how long the government has agreed to give the HRA
 yah prashn abhi bhi karmchaariyon ko sata rahaa he
 Does this rate 1
 1
 16 or 1 is applied
 4
 With effect from 17, it will be applicable
 jahaan tak karmchaariyon kaa sawaal he vah ise pichley saal janvari se lagu karwaane kii maang karte rahe hai or sarkaar kii ore se kuch samay pehle aisa ishaara mila tha ki sabhi vivaadit alouns ko 1 april 2017 se lagu kiya jayega
 For information, let us tell that the demand of employees is that HRA should be decided on the basis of the old formula or its rate should be increased
 kendriya karmchaariyon kaa kahana he ki vartmaan main tay formula ke hisaab se echaare karmchaariyon ko pehle kii tulana main kam milane laga he
 Let me tell you that there is confusion about many allowances given to the Central Employees by the Seventh Pay Commission
 narendra modi sarkaar ne 2016 main saatven vetan ayog (7th Pay Commission) kii siforeeshon ko manjuuri di thi or 1 janvari 2016 se 7wein vetan ayog kii report ko lagu kiya tha
 However, due to disagreement on several issues with allowances, these recommendations were not fully implemented
 kaha ja rahaa he ki sarkaar kii ore se baatcheet ke liye adhikrut adhikari echaare ko 1 str upar karne ko taiyaar hue hai ab echaare 30%, 20% or 10% tak ho saktaa he
 At the same time, reports are being received from reliable sources that 30 percent can be done in big cities, but it is not decided yet
 karmchaaree sanghathan kaa kahana rahaa he ki agar sarkaar ne echaare badhaayaa nahin he to gata kaise sakati hai
 In support of their argument, the workers argue that the rent of the house has come down in the cities
 kya makaan saste ho gaye hai
 When this has not happened how can the government do injustice to its employees
 bataa den ki vetan ayog (pe kamishan) ne apni report main echaare ko aarambh main 24%, 16% or 8% tay kiya tha or kaha gaya tha ki jab die 50 pratishat tak pahunch jayega to yah 27%, 18% or 9% kramash: ho jayega
 Not only this, the Pay Commission had also said that when DA becomes 100%, then the rate will be 30%, 20% and 10% for X, y and z cities respectively

 The organization alleges that the commission completely rejected the employees' demand
 unka kahana he ki vetan ayog ne is rate ko chathe vetan ayog se bhi kam kar diya he
 They say that because it is combined with DA, it will increase only when the DA rate increases by a fixed percentage
 tippaniyan For information, let us know that before the Seventh Pay Commission, central employees were entitled to 196 types of allowances
 lekin saatven vetan ayog ne kai alounces ko samaapt kar diya yaa phir unhen mila diya jiske baad keval 55 alouns baaki rah gaye
 Many employees are sorry for ending many allowances
 kyonki kai alouns abhi tak lagu nahin hue or karmchaariyon ko uskaa sidhaa laabh nahin mila he to karmchaariyon ko lag rahaa he ki vetan ayog kii report abhi lagu nahin hui

 Because many allowances have not been implemented yet and the employees have not received their direct benefits, the employees feel that the Pay Commission report is not yet implemented
 bataa den ki saatven vetan ayog kii report se karmchaariyon kii kai shikaayatein rahi hai or aise main centre kii narendra modi sarkaar ne apane karmchaariyon kii shikayaton ko dur karne ke liye sambandhit mantralay or vittamantralay ke adheen samitiyon kaa gathan kiya he
 These committees are talking to the staff leaders and these committees had to give their decision to the government in four months, but so far only the final committee meeting has been held
 ullekhneey he ki karmchaariyon ke sanyukt sanghathan enzesie ne gathit vetan ayog ke samaksh apni maang se sambandhit gyaapan main is dar ko kramash: 60%, 40% or 20% karne ke liye kaha tha
 The organization alleges that the commission completely rejected the employees' demand
 unka kahana he ki vetan ayog ne is rate ko chathe vetan ayog se bhi kam kar diya he
 They say that because it is combined with DA, it will increase only when the DA rate increases by a fixed percentage
 tippaniyan For information, let us know that before the Seventh Pay Commission, central employees were entitled to 196 types of allowances
 lekin saatven vetan ayog ne kai alounces ko samaapt kar diya yaa phir unhen mila diya jiske baad keval 55 alouns baaki rah gaye
 Many employees are sorry for ending many allowances
 kyonki kai alouns abhi tak lagu nahin hue or karmchaariyon ko uskaa sidhaa laabh nahin mila he to karmchaariyon ko lag rahaa he ki vetan ayog kii report abhi lagu nahin hui
 Explain that there have been many complaints of employees from the report of the Seventh Pay Commission and in such a situation the Narendra Modi government of the Center has set up committees under the concerned Ministry and Ministry of Finance to address the grievances of its employees
 ye samitiyaan karmchaaree netaaon se baat kar rahi hai or is samitiyon ko apana faisla chaar maheene main sarkaar ko dena tha lekin abhi tak keval alouns samiti kii hi antim baithak hui he

 Today is the birth anniversary of Kunwar Narayan, one of the most talented poets of our time
 19 sitambar, 1927 ko kunwar narayan kaa janm hua
 He did his MA in English Literature from Lucknow University in 1951
 1973 se 1979 tak vah 'sangeet naatak academy' ke up-peethadhyaksh bhi rahe
 From 1975 to 1978 he was also a member of the editorial board of the monthly magazine edited by Sachchidananda Hiranand Vatsyayan Agyeya
 saal 2005 main kunwar narayan ko sahitya jagat ke sarvocch sammaan gyanpith puraskaar se sammanit kiya gaya
 Apart from this, he was also awarded the Sahitya Akademi Award in 1995 and 'padma Vibhushan', the country's second highest honor in 2009
 90 saal kii umr main jab kunwar narayan kaa 15 november, 2017 ko dehavsaan hua tha, tab tak hindi sahitya unki kavitaaon se kaaphi samrudh ho chukaa tha
 Kunwar Narayan honored Hindi literature with his varied works
 unke kavy-lakshya jitne ujle the, utani hi ujali manushya-maatr main unki aasthaa thi
 The poems of Kunwar Narayan are said to have been dialogues from his time
 unamem astitv kii anugunj he
 Poetry collection in his compositions: Chakravyuh, third octave, surroundings: Hum Tum, Atmajayi, in front of you, none other, these days, Vajashrava's pretext, witness to the margins are prominent, so Story Collection: Around Shapes and Review Book: Today And works like before were very much discussed
 'shabd or deshkal' naamak pustak un kii vichaar sampada kaa ek anoothaa udhaaharan he
 It also has articles with explanations given on various occasions
 bhashaa, sahitya, samaaj, media, anuwaad or anya prashnon par kendrit unke vichaar dhyanpurvak padhe jane kii maang karte hai
 These articles by Kunwar Narayan, who are concerned with the wisdom of the world, enrich the reader fundamentally
 kunwar ji sahitya ko keval sahitya kii drushti se nahin balki arthshaastra, vigyaan, raajnneetik, itihaas, shastron aadi kii drushti se bhi dekhte hai
 At its core, they have a unwavering faith in literature, to which they point out, "no matter how small the" place of literature "," time "is large
 " aaj kunwar narayan kii jayanti par unki pustak 'shabd or deshkal' kaa yah ansh sahitya ajtak par padhenhindi kaa bhavishya- bhavishya kii hindimain theth shastreey arthon main bhashavid nahin hoon, na hi sahitya kaa siddhantkaar, lekin ek kavi or lekhak kii haisiyat se hindi bhashaa ko rachanaatmak dhang se baratane ke apane anubhavon ke aadhaar par kuch baaten kahana chaahoonga
 Hindi is considered to be one of the major languages spoken in the world at this time
 anya bhashaaen angrezi, chini or spani-mul kii bhashaayen hai
 Linguistic data shows that more than 6000 languages are being spoken in the world at the moment, but with the rapid disappearance of the smaller languages, it seems to be confirmed that by the end of this millennium, not even 600 of these languages
 Will be saved! The linguistic future of Hindi is bright
 ek rachanaakaar kii drushti se- ‘parivartan’ or ‘vikaas’ ke bich ek baariq fark karte hue- tezi se badalati hui hindi bhashaa kii nabz ko padhane kii koshish karata hum
 What kind of qualitative impact is this 'change', and its 'quickness', on the nature of Hindi? This qualitative aspect holds special significance for literature which is basically the 'human' and 'intimate' side of life
 vah sahitya main kai-kai tarah pratibimbit or abhivyanjit hota he
 That language is first the language of a long culture of mutual harmony, sympathy, courtesy and tolerance, in which we recognize our most valuable image of being a decent human being
 sahaj hi dhyaan jaataa he ki hindi bhashaa ne meraa matlab yahaan hindi ke us vyapak pariprekshya se he jisamen urdu or sthaneey boliyon kaa sahitya shaamil he
 World-class and classic literature is given even when it was not a 'global language', only the language of small 'regions'
 vah samay bhi yaad aata he jab puure bharat ko ek bhaavnaatmak sutara main jode rakhane kaa kaam bhakthi-kaaleen kavy or kalaon dwaara sambhav hua- raajnneetik sparddhaon or maar-kaat ke baavjood
 Even today, all the small languages of the world are giving great world-class literature
 nobel-puraskaar vijetaon kii list par ek nazar daalana hi kaafii hoga is tathy ko pusht karne ke liye ki ‘bade’ sahitya kii rachana ke liye ‘badi’ bhashaa anivaary nahin he
 English was also a small language when Shakespeare's writings made it a very large language
 isi tarah avadhi or brij kii asaadhaaran bhashaai kshamta ko kabir, jaaysi, tulsi, sur aadi kii saahitiyik dein ke bina puri tarah nahin samajha ja saktaa
 An audacious way of thinking also comes to mind that perhaps big language is not a big boon for big literature
 ek bhashaa kaa vistaar kai kaarnon se hota he- pramukhtah tijaarti, audyogic, aarthik, raajnneetik aadi kaarnon se
 These reasons can also be clearly identified behind the expansion of Hindi language today
 raajnneetik, aarthik or audyogic drushti se bharat or china ab pichde hue desh nahin hai
 Along with this development, the importance of language has not only increased but their 'use' has also changed and is changing very rapidly - almost at a machine-age pace
 mote taur par kahen to bhashaa ‘maanviya’ se adhik ‘masini’ hoti ja rahi he!bhashaa ke maanviya gunon kii apeksha uske vyavsaayik or len-dein ke muhaavarey or shabdaawalee zyaada kaamkaaj ke lagate hai, atah zyaada praasangik
 The language of mutual relations, empathy and deep human concerns seems lifeless
 yah keval ek bhashaai sankat nahin he, bhashaa par padanevaale us sankat kii chaaya he jo aaj ke kramshah samvedanheen hote ja rahe jivan kii ore ishaara karata he
 Even today, when we listen to a folk song or read a regional poem or novel, we find in it a special kind of tenderness of language, emotional honesty and dignity of kindred brotherhood
 aaj ke audyogic, vyavsaayik or upabhokta samaaj main jo bilkul asthaayee or matlabi sambandh ban rahe hai
 How much space is left in their language for deep and sublime human relations and thinking, should be the concern of every man, not only of literature
 choti bhashaaon se aa rahe sahitya main agar aapasadaari he, ki ye bhashaayen aaj bhi apni ghanishthata or ooshmaa main bachi hui hai, to iskaa bahut bada kaaran vah jivan-style bhi he jo bade shaharon kii apeksha choti jagahon main kam badalati he
 Changes and development in language are closely associated with life, which, not grammatical rules, determines the pace of life, basically in a biological way
 sanskrit se aaj kii hindi tak kii vikaas-yatra ko bhi lagbhag usee tarah samajha ja saktaa he jaise ham aadmi kii lambi aitihaasik jivan-yatra ko samajhate hai
 Just as we cannot think of the motions of life and history by keeping them in a straight line, the speed of language is also very complex and zigzag
 ganga nadi apane udgam par jo hoti he, bengal kii khadi main giranevaali nadi vahi ganga nahin hoti
 It has included the water of all the small and big rivers flowing in the middle regions in such a way that they cannot be separated again
 ve sab ganga kii mukhyadhara ban jaati hai
 The development of Hindi language should also be understood in a similar way
 bhashaa ke vistaar ke saath ‘amanavikaran’ kii samasya ko uthaate samay kisi saral nattejey par pahunchane kii jaldbaazi nahin kerani chahie
 Language develops simultaneously on many levels, not just on one or two levels
 bhautik jivan main badlaav ke saath bhashaa kii upree sataha par badlaav- yani hamaari bolchaal, vyavhaar, len-dein, vaanijya, vyapaar aadi kii bhashaa main- sabase pehle or sabase spasht dikhaai detaa he lekin, aadmi ke swabhaav kii hi tarah, uski bhashaa kii bhi kai aantarik parat hoti hai
 They do not change easily because in them the memories of centuries of rites and contemplation remain inexplicably buried
 mote taur par ise bhashaa kaa ‘avchetan’ kah sakate hai, jo ‘nijee’ se ‘samuhik’ tak ek atoot maansik judaav rakhata he
 The key to this formulation lies somewhere in our genes, that is why the pace of development of life and language is considered twin
 ek bhashaa kaa bahustareey hona uski jaagrukta kii nishaani he
 If at one level it can be the practical language of speech, transaction, public life, then at another level it can also be the deep language of thinking, thinking, contemplation, study and knowledge
 donon par oonch-neech kaa tark lagu nahin hota
 These are two completely different uses of the language and show its strength
 bhashaa na keval apane ko dainik jivan ke str par rachati he balki vaicharik or aatm-chintan ke str par bhi, or bhashaa ke ye donon hi paksh jaays hai kyonki donon milakar hamen ek brihad jivan-drushti dete hai
 Similarly, languages of literature and arts are also distinct and valid languages in the belief that they make possible a different type of euphemism and expression of life
 jivan kii hi tarah bhashaa kii bhi is ‘bhinnata’ ko bina udaartaa se sweekaar kiye ham uski samgr jivan-shakti ko aatmsaat nahin kar paaenge
 Thinking about the future of Hindi language, some things especially arise in the mind
 hindi bhashaa kii ‘prakruti’ main hajaaron saal ke achche-bure aitihaasik anubhavon kii yaaden ghuli-mili hai
 It also has ground truth and experiences of many sublime ideas and arts
 saikadon varshon ke gahan vaidic, vedantik, sufi- chintan, kalaon or kavy ne bhashaa par apni amit chhap chodi he, jise aaj bhi hindi bhashaa ke swabhaav se alag kar paanaa mushkil ho jaataa he
 The pressure of ideas, literature and arts also creates and enables a language in its own way
 kabhi-kabhi yah prabhaav dainik yatharth ke dabaavon se kahin zyaada shaktishaalee hota he
 When Buddhist thought spread in Central Asia, there was hardly any language of Asia which was unaffected by it
 anek bhashaaon main buddha ke vichaaron ke liye ek bhinn str kii bhashaa nirmit hui
 Even in modern times, we see that with its big idea comes its own specific language, the language of discussion
 uskaa apana ek dabadabaa hota he or kabhi-kabhi vah der tak or dur tak saamaanya bhashaa par chaaya rahata he
 In modern times, the dominance of words like logic and analysis with science has dominated almost every type of language of thinking
 marks or frid kaa chintan iskaa pramukh udhaaharan he
 Who have far influenced the thinking of the entire twentieth century
 jo tarksangat he vahi sahi he
 This thing has been so ingrained in our minds or has been seated, that any truth can be beyond logic, we do not want to consider it to be considered
 tark achook nahin hota
 Vitarka and Kutarka are also associated with it
 kah sakna mushkil he ki bhavishya main hindi kaa kya rup viksit hoga, par man main kahin ek sapana zarur he ki hindi kaa arth keval chizon or unke upbhog tak simit hokar na rah jaae
 He can also become a capable voice of a self-culture and a life-conscience whose power has been known and proved in many ways by a country like India going through its long and odd historical experiences

 Amid the ban on beef and the growing controversy, Azam Khan, a minister in the Akhilesh government, has appealed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to overcome the situation
 ajam ne iske saath hi ek bayaan jari kar kaha ki desh main jin five star hotalon main bif parosa jaataa he, unki babari masjid kii tarah hi eent se eent baja deni chahie
 Azam Khana has told PM Modi in his statement, 'we are repeatedly appealing to the Prime Minister to keep control over those people who incite communalism and violence
 pradhanmantri antarrashtriya manchon par local mudde uthaate hai, isliye ham yuan main sampradayik hinsa ke maamle uthaaenge
 'azam Khan says we are planning to raise rising communal violence cases at unpic
 twitter
 com / slaqtgnnih — ANI (@ani_news) October 5, 2015 The Minister, angry with the case of the beating of a man named Ikhlaq on the rumor of having beef in Dadri, has issued a written statement to this effect
 haalanki naaraazgi jaahir karne ke liye likhe gaye is bayaan main unhone sanvadensheel tippanee kar di he
 The SP leader has challenged the 'gobhaktas', saying that every 'gobhaktas' should not let the price of beef be written in the menu of any hotel after today
 unhone bayaan main likhaa he, 'agar aisa ho to aise sabhi paanch sitara hotalon kii usee tarah eent se eent baja den, jis tarah babari masjid kii bajaai thi
 Katju's statement is supported by Aajam Khan's statement on the Supreme Court's retired Justice Markandey Katju Kegomance
 unhone iske bahaane bhi 'gobhakton' ko nishane par liya he
 The statement reads, 'only poor Muslims who claim to be cowards can attack
 justise katju ne jab biechayu main gomance khaane ko lekar bayaan diya tha to us vakt kai gobhakt or modi bhakt bhi vahaan maujuud the
 Despite this, no one dared to say anything
 aisa isliye hua kyonki gomance khaane or uskaa samarthan karne vaala koi garib musalmaan nahin tha

 Aamir, through the show which started on May 6, exposed many unintentional facts related to female feticide, child sexual abuse, medical irregularities, dowry and human scavenging
 aisa nahin tha ki aamir ne apni saamaajik jimmedaari keval screen par nibhaai

 If you like eating litchi, then be careful, because eating litchi can also kill you
 haalia adhyayan main lichi ko lekar kuch aise hi chaunkaane vaale khulaase kiye gaye hai
 In fact, it has been said in the study report that eating litchi on an empty stomach can prove to be fatal
 lichi main hypoglicin e or mithailincyclopropylagisin naam kaa jaharila tatv hota he, jo khaali pet main jate hi jehar kii tarah kaam shuru kar detaa he
 World Cancer Day: Tobacco is the main reason for cancer, when it was revealed when the death of children in suspected condition in Muzaffarpur, Bihar for the last two decades was studied
 maut kaa ye aankada may or june ke maheene main kaaphi bad jaataa tha
 According to media reports, in 2014, 390 children succumbed to the disease, who were later hospitalized, out of which 122 children died
 iske baad bharat or america ke vaigyanikon ne is par adhyayan kiya
 a 3-year study showed that eating litchi on an empty stomach was the cause of children's deaths
 is fal ko khaane se khatm ho jayega cancer
 
 
 Examination of blood and urine of hospitalized children revealed that hypoglycine a and methylencyclopropylglycine elements were present in their body
 biimaar bacchon main se zyaadaatar ne shaam yaa raat kaa khaanaa nahin khaaya tha or subah zyada maatra main lichi khai thi
 In this condition, the effect of these elements is more harmful
 is report ke saamne aane ke baad bharat sarkaar ne bhi nirdesh jari kiye hai
 At the same time, doctors are advising children to consume litchi in limited quantity after having a balanced meal in the morning
 desh main aaj uttarakhand ke jile paudi kaa danka baj rahaa he
 All the top officials in the top security posts of the entire country come from Pauri district
 yaheen nahin desh ke sabase bade rajya uttar pradesh ke mukhiya yogi adityanath bhi khud paudi ke panchur gaavan se hi hai
 The Chief Minister of Uttarakhand is also from Khairsand village in the same district
 uttarakhand ke saath-saath desh ke bade-bade netaa or adhikari dene main bhi paudi peeche nahin he
 From former Chief Minister Bhuvan Chand Khanduri to Vijay Bahuguna, Harak Singh Rawat, Satpal Maharaj, Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank, Army Chief Bipin Rawat, Security Advisor Ajit Doval, Anil Dhasmana are all associated with this soil
 baavjood iske paudi aaj bhi palaayan, pani or shiksha kii jabardast maar jhel rahaa he
 The state of Uttarakhand came into existence in the year 2000 after several movements, after which the people here hope that now the entire state will develop, people will have employment, good education and good health services
 in sabase se unka jivan behad achche tareeke se beetegaa
 But his hopes were shaken when unemployment, lack of education and poor health services started dominating the entire state and eventually people left their old village and started migrating
 paudi uttarakhand ko wo jila he jahaan sabase zyada palaayan hua
 Case Study-1 The team of 'ajatak' first reviewed the Banakh village of Pauri
 palaayan kii maar jhel rahe is gaanv main sabase zyada kami he to wo he pine ke pani kii
 People craving water drop by drop do not hesitate at all to say that the leaders whom we voted for and reached the peak of power have now forgotten us
 sthaneey logon ke mutabik na unke paas pine ko pani he or na hi bacchon ko shiksha dene ke liye achche skool hai
 It is meaningless to talk about health services and this is the reason that many people migrated from here to live elsewhere with the whole family
 sarkaar kii ore se yahaan pani kii tank to lagaai gaye lekin usamen saalon pani nahin he
 Due to which all the villagers fetch water from a distance of 10 km from the village through a rented car
 usee pani serosemara ke kaam kisi tarah se ho pate hai
 If the guests ever come to the house, then the shortage of water increases further
 yahaan ke halaat itane kharaab hai ki nahaane-dhone ke liye hi nahin balki pine ke liye bhi pani mayssar nahin he
 If local resident Rajendra Singh believes, now his trust from governments has been lost
 shiksha or swasthya sevaaon ke abhaav ke baad yahaan bane kaaphi makaan tak ab khandhar ho chale hai
 Those who are expected to be inhabited are no more, just as much as is left is enough
 jis tarah se gaanv ke gaanv logon se khaali ho gaye hai wo behad dukhad he, jahaan jivan hota tha ab vahaan sannata bikharaa padaa he
 Locks on houses look like there was never any life there
 cese study 2banekh kii samasya sunne or samajhane ke baad ham kharesend kii ore bade jo uttarakhand ke mukhyamantri trivendra singh ravat kaa gaanv he
 CM Rawat himself escaped and went to Dehradun with his family about 17 years ago
 gaanv main ghuste hi team ke mulaaqaat mukhyamantri ke bade bhai brijmohan or siem ko class 6 tak padhaa chuke unke teacher se ho gai
 His complaint was also like a common citizen
 unhone bataaya berogari, khastahal shiksha or karaab swasthya sevaaon kii vajah se 60 fisad se zyada log palaayan kar chuke hai
 Farming is on the verge of destruction and there is no one to listen
 gaanv main ekmaatr skool to he par uski haalat itani karaab hai kii vahaan ab keval 80 bachche hi padhai karne aate hai
 If the children fall, then due to lack of teachers, the standard of education is falling further
 mukhyamantri ravat ke skool teacher ne bataaya ki kuch saal pehle tak itnaa palaayan nahin tha log yahaan kheti karke gujara karte the
 Both the house and the farm were inhabited, but now where there was ever paddy, now there is only a tree
 gaanv main kheti karne ke liye log hi nahin bache hai
 But the villagers now have hope from Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat
 shaayad unke satta sanbhaalane se kharesend gaanv or paudi kii haalat pehle se sudhar jaae
 Case Study 3 From Khera village, our team reached the area of yogiadityanath
 yahaan bhi moolbhoot suvidhaon ke abhaav ko lekar jabardast tareeke se palaayan ho rahaa he
 What children, women, elderly people all have to walk far away for water
 panchur main jis tarah pani ko lekar lambi line lagi mili usko dekhakar ye andaaza lagaana kathin nahin he ki palaayan kii asal vajah kya he
 Anand Singh Bisht, the father of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, also says that to prevent migration, consolidation is needed first, when chakas are formed, there will be agriculture and plows on it, which will make the land fertile
 barsaat kaa jo pani bah jaaya karata he wo dharti ke andar tak jaayegaa or suukh chuke pani ke strot phis se chaalu ho jaayenge
 He said that the government makes a lot of schemes but those schemes do not appear to work on the ground
 desh kaa zyaadatak pahari ilaaka palaayan kaa sankat jhel rahaa he
 Yet no government has worked in concrete ways in this direction till date
 pahari ilaakon kaa dard bhi pahaad jitna hi bada he
 The movement of this state, which was formed 18 years ago, was fought on the basis that with the formation of a separate state, governments would restore the basic facilities like water, electricity, roads, education and health services, but this did not happen
 baharhaal rajya banane ke itane saal baad ab palaayan kii samasya ne vikaraal rup le liya he
 Today is the birthday of the God of cricket Sachin Tendulkar
 cricket main unako bhagwaan kii tarah puja jaataa hai
 Sachin Tendulkar is the only batsman to score 100 international centuries in world cricket
 jab sachin tendulkar khelaa karte the tab unki ballebaazi ko dekhne kaa ek alag hi majaa hota tha
 The whole world loved watching Sachin Tendulkar play and score a century

 The Delhi Police has sought some more details, including the estimated number of people visiting and the list of vips, before allowing Team Anna to agitate at Ramlila Maidan from 27 December

 Station in-charge Pramod Joshi wrote in his letter, 'you are informed that you have not given clarification on the following points'

 ujjain sinhasth kumbh bhi raashiyon or grahon ke vishesh yoga main padataa he
 The sacredness and glory of Kumbh is also mentioned in the Vedas and Puranas
 jaane aasthaa ke is mahaan centre kii visheshtaayen or mahaparv se judi puranic katha
 
 
 Yoga of Ujjain Simhastha and the importance of Kumbh: - Kumbh is held once in 12 years
 ujjain singhsthake liye singh raashi main brihaspati, mesh main surya or tula raashi main chandra ke grah-yoga maane jate hai
 On this special festival, by taking a dip in the Shipra River, a person gets a reward by getting rid of his sins
 - vishnu puraana main kumbh ke mahanata main likhaa gaya he ki karthik maas ke hajaaron snanon kaa, magh ke sau snanon kaa athwa baishakh maas main ek karod narmada snanon kaa jo fal praapt hota he, vahi fal kumbh parv ke ek snaan se miltaa he
 In the same way, the fruit of thousands of Ashwamedha Yagyas or the result of hundred Vajpayee Yajnas and the result of performing one lakh revolutions of the entire earth, the same fruit is the result of only one bath of Kumbh
 is tarah hamaare vedon, puraanon or shastron main kumbh kaa mahatv bataaya gaya he
 - According to Atharvaveda - Mahakumbh comes after twelve years, which we see many times in Prayagadi pilgrimages
 kumbh us samay ko kehete hai jab akaash main grah-raashiyon kaa adbhut yoga dekhne ko miltaa he
 - It is told in the Yajurveda that Kikumbhmanus is the person who gives physical pleasure in this world and the best happiness in every birth
 - atharvaveda main brahma ne kaha he ki he manushyon! main tumhen sansaarik sukhon ko dene vaale chaar kumbh parvon kaa nirmaan kar chaar sthanon haridwar, prayag, ujjain or nasik main pradaan karata hum
 According to the importance of Maha Kumbha mentioned in the Vedas and Puranas, Kumbh is the nectar of our culture which is celebrated on the banks of Shipra in Ujjain with the sum of planetary signs
 kumbh kii katha -kumbh ke aayojan ke sambandh main anek kathaayen prachlit hai
 The most common churning story is iske anusaar devataaon or daanvon ne milakar samudr manthan karne ke baad amrit kalash praapt kiya
 In order to save the nectar from the demons, the gods had entrusted the responsibility of protecting it to Jupiter, Moon, Sun and Saturn
 devataaon ke pramukh indra putr jayant jab amrit kalash lekar bhaage, tab daanav unke peeche daude
 There was a fierce struggle between the gods and the demons to get the nectar
 kaha jaataa he ki yah sangram 12 din tak chalaa
 Since one day of the gods is considered equal to one year of humans, this war lasted for twelve years
 amrit kalash paane ke liye is yuddh main amrit kii boonden dharti par chaar sthanon - haridwar, prayag,nasikor ujjain main chhalkin
 Legendary belief is that the rivers of these four places - Ganga, Yamuna, Godavari and Shipra - became amritamayi with drops of spill from Amrit Kalash
 amrit boonden chhalakane ke samay jin raashiyon main surya, chandra, guru kii sthiti ke vishisht yoga ke avasar rahete hai, unheen vishesh avasaro par kumbh parv yojit kiye jate hai
 In defense of this nectar urn, Surya, Guru and Moon made additional efforts
 isi vajah se in grahon kii vishesh sthitiyon main kumbh parv manaane kii parampara he

 This comment of Katrina Kaif was taken as a comment on Jahnavi Kapoor's clothes
 vivaad tab bad gaya jab sonam kapur (sonam Kaoor) ne apane instagram par jahnavi kapur kii dress ko lekar ek coment kar diya
 Sonam shared a picture and wrote that Jahnavi also wears regular clothes and she rocks

 The Supreme Court on Tuesday cut the statement of Union Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar on his remarks that instead of rotting the grain in the government godowns and distributing it free to the poor, he said that he had ordered it and not the suggestion as the Agriculture Minister wants to say
 duusari ore rajd adhyaksh or purv rail mantri lalu prasad yadav ne sharad pavaar ke maamle par kaha he ki yaa to wo anaaj muft main baante nahin to unhen istipha de dena chahie
 The bench, which is hearing the matter, told the government counsel on Tuesday that it was not a suggestion
 hamane yah aadesh kiya tha
 Tell this to the minister
 nyaayamurti dalvir bhandari or nyaayamuti deepak verma kii peeth ne taaja tippanee akhabaaron kii un reporton ke sandarbh main kii, jinamein pavaar ne kaha tha ki nyaayalay ne is maamle main koi aadesh nahin diya he
 The court clarified that it had given the order
 pavaar ne kaha tha ki supremecourt kaa (anaaj muft main baantne) kaa suzav lagu karnaa sambhav nahin he
 The court ordered that the government should conduct a survey of eligible families of BPL, APL and Antyodaya Anna Yojana based on 2010 data
 nyaayalay ne kaha ki sarkarein das saal puraane aankadon ke aadhaar par is tarah kii chhot nahin de sakati
 The court also said that the government must take steps to protect the grain so that it does not rot
 peeth ne yah bhi kaha ki sarkaar ko utane hi anaj kii kharid kerani chahie jitne kii vah hifaazat kar sake
 The Supreme Court reiterated its previous order stating that subsidized food grains cannot be provided to families above the poverty line
 par yadi sarkaar unhen yah laabh dene par tuli hi he to salanaa teen lakh rupee kii aay ke neeche ke pariwaron ko hi yah laabh diya ja saktaa he

 gujarat ke griharajya mantri pradeep singh jaadeja kaa kahana he ki is game ko lekar har jile ke esaspi, colector or police ko guideline jari kii gai he
 Apart from this, the name of the person who gives information on the blue whale game helpline number will also be kept confidential
 gujarat sarkaar blue whale game ko rokane kii puri koshish kar rahi he, taaki yuva ise na khelen or kisi bhi anhoni se batch sakate hai
 It is known that a person from Banaskantha, Gujarat, committed suicide by jumping into the water to complete the last task of the Blue Whale game
 pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne kaha he ki adhikariyon ko kade faisle lene se nahin hichakana chahie
 Has the government stopped? This question arose after the statement of the Chief Economic Advisor to the PM
 lekin pradhanmantri ne bhi mana ki desh kaa naukarshahi tantra faisle lene se ghabara rahaa he
 Speaking at a program organized on Civil Service Day at Vigyan Bhawan in Delhi, the PM exhorted the officials not to be afraid of taking decisions
 unhone kaha ki adhikariyon ko is baat kii chintaa nahin honi chahie ki unase galati hogi yaa unhen sajaa di jaaegi
 The officers should take decisions, but those decisions should be according to the law
 pradhanmantri ne mana ki naukarshahi main bhrashtachar he
 He said that people believe that a decade ago, the bureaucracy was strong in morality, but today morality has decreased
 sarkaar main nitigat pakshaaghaat hone ke aaropon kaa saamana kar rahe pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne naukarshahon se faisle lene main ‘dridhtaa’ dikhaane kaa aahvaan kiya or unhen aashwaasan diya ki bhrashtachar ke khilaaf sangharsh ke naam par kisi ko nishaanaa nahin banaaya jayega
 In an event on the occasion of Lok Sevak Day, Singh told the bureaucrats that if there is a fear in their mind that if things go wrong they may get punished for it and they are not taking any decision out of this fear, they have this tendency Need to fight
 pradhanmantri ne kaha, ‘yah hamaara prayaas ho ki bhrashtachar ke khilaaf sangharsh ke naam par kisi ko nishaanaa nahin banaaya janaa chahie
 It is our government's commitment to create a system and environment in which our bureaucrats are enthusiastic about being decisive and that no one gets harassed without making a mistake without taking decisions
 ’haalanki singh ne yah bhi kaha ki pataa nahin yah galat he yaa sahi, lekin yah avadharana badhati ja rahi he ki aam taur par naukarshahon or janasevakon kii naitik shakti ab utani majboot nahin he jitna kuch dashak pehle hoti thi or ab naukarshahon ke apane kaamkaaj ke dauraan bahari dabaav ke saamne jhukne kii adhik sambhaavna hoti he
 He said, 'this concept may have been introduced exaggeratedly, but i think there is some truth in it
 ’is baat par bal dete hue ki naukarshah jo faisle lete hai, ve nishpaksh or vastunishth hon, unhone spasht kiya ki sarkaar un eemaandaar or sarthak naukarshahon kii suraksha ke liye katibaddh he, jinase ho saktaa he ki apane kaamkaaj ke dauraan sahi myne main bhul ho gayi ho
 The Prime Minister said, 'we cannot have a bureaucracy that is 100 percent left in terms of risk
 vastav main, hamen faisle lene main dridhtaa ko badhaava dena chahie, basharte kii faisle suvichaarit hon or kanoon ke anuroop hon
 Singh said, "there may be a bureaucrat who does not take decisions, he will always be safe, but ultimately his contribution to society and country will be nothing

 - input IANS The Supreme Court dismissed the petition filed against BJP President Amit Shah for the discharge of charges in the Sohrabuddin Sheikh encounter case
 saamaajik kaaryakarta harsh mandar ne ye yachika daakhil kii thi
 Earlier, the Bombay High Court had also dismissed this petition
 supreme court ne kaha ki harsh mandar is maamle main pakshakaar nahin ban sakate hai
 They do not have any locus in this matter
 soharabuddin cese kii sunwyeemumbai main chal rahi he
 The CBI had also filed a charge sheet against Amit Shah along with the rest of the accused
 lekin nichali adaalat ne mana ki amit shah ke khilaaf aarope nahin ban rahe hai
 The reason given by the court for rejecting the petition was in the petition filed by social activist and former IAS officer Harsh Mander that he wants to file a petition to reconsider the Mumbai court's decision to discharge Amit Shah from the case
 
 mandar ke vakil kapil sibbal ne adaalat se kaha" ye maamla behad aham he, isaki samvedansheeltaa ko dekhte hue ise gujarat se maharashtra transafar kiya gaya
 The CBI filed a charge sheet in the case, according to which Amit Shah was accused number 16
 lekin unhen aropamukt kar diya gaya or sibiai ne is faisle ko chunauti tak nahin di
 According to the old judgments of the Supreme Court, a third person can also interfere in such a case
 amit shah ke vakil ne puraane cese kaa diya havaladusri taraf amit shah kii taraf se pairvi kar rahe varisht vakil harish salve ne sanvaidhanik peeth ke hi ek faisle kaa hawala dete hue kaha kii aapraadhik maamle main koi bhi teesraa vyakti pakshakaar nahin ho saktaa he
 The Supreme Court said that according to the old decisions of the constitution bench itself, only the parties concerned in the criminal case can be parties
 koi teesraa vyakti dakhal nahin de saktaa he isliye ye yachika khaarij kii jaati he
 Harsh Mander also said in the petition that the court should also investigate Sohrabuddin's brother Rabibuddin Sheikh with the CBI or any independent agency as to why he withdrew his application from the Bombay High Court? Whereas he has been fighting a court battle in this encounter case from the beginning
 soharabuddin ke bhai ne hai court main di thi yachikagoratlab he kii 30 disambar 2014 ko mumbai kisibiai adalatane amit shah ko is cese se aropamukt kar diya tha or kaha tha ki unhen raajnneetik vajahon se fansaaya gaya tha
 In November last year, the Bombay High Court accepted the application of Rabibuddin Sheikh in which he said that he could not contest the case further due to health reasons
 isi par harsh mandar ne maang kii thi ki iske peeche kii asli vajah kii jaanch honi chahie
 However, the Bombay High Court, in March this year, dismissed the petition, saying that it was not worth hearing and that the petitioner was not the aggrieved party

 meraa skool mere ghar ke paas tha, saare shikshak papa ke jaanane-pahchaanane vaale the, isliye meri har shikaayat yaa acchhee baaten papa tak bahut jaldi pahunch jaati thi
 i never liked this thing
 main hameshaa skool badalanaa chaahati thi lekin papa kii jid ke aage aisa kabhi nahin ho paaya
 There was a well in our school
 aise to us kuen ko majboot jaali se dhak diya gaya tha
 But all the children of our school were afraid of that well more than their teachers because during the prayer many questions were suddenly asked to a child, if someone fails to answer that question, then hold his foot in the well Threatened to drop
 bacchon ko kuen se daraane ke liye hamaare yahaan ek shikshak maujuud the, jo maar-peet ke liye puure skool main kukhyat the
 One day my turn came, i never felt as scared as i was that day
 main jor-jor se 'mummy-mummy' bolkar rone lagi
 But unfortunately my legs were also caught and taken to the well
 jaali hataai gai or kuen ke us andhere se daraya gaya
 After this, there were also threats that i would definitely drop next time
 main chupchaap dari sahami prarthana se waapas class ai
 Took the book and ran away from school but did not go home
 mausi ke ghar jaakar vahiin duusare bhai-bahanon ke saath khilne lagi
 i followed this method for two-three days
 roj skool ke liye nikalati thi lekin skool nahin jaati thi
 At that time, there was no time for the phone to call aunt to call either mother or father
 mausa gaanv main rahete nahin the, mausi ghar se nikalati nahin thi
 On the third or fourth day, my father was asked by my teacher 'neha's health is not bad, she is not coming to school'? Papa started searching for me after that i could not find them
 shaam ko apane tay skool samay ke mutabik main ghar waapas aa gai
 Papa asked what were the studies in school today, i started telling some rote things
 do-teen shabd bolne ke baad hi gaal par jor kaa thappad padaa
 She would have come to save her mother, otherwise she would have been beaten up more
 uske agle din papa khud mujhe skool chhodane gaye
 i was silent in class, which was against my nature
 padhai main bilkul bhi man nahin lag rahaa tha
 i wanted to tear everything away from copy-books
 isi samay hamaare skool main bacchon kaa khyaal rakhane vaale sipaahi ji (ek anya teacher, gaanv main vah isi naam se mashhoor the) meri sthiti samaj gaye the
 In the evening, after coming to school, he came to me and said, 'let me bring something with you'
 main achaanak bahut khush hui
 Went to see that he had brought a lot of things i liked
 un sari chizon ko lekar wo kuen ke paas gaye
 i started feeling scared again
 unhone mujhe kuen main jhaankne ke liye kaha or bole are daro mat yaad rakho 'shikshak kabhi bhi kuen main nahin dhakelta he, jo shikshak kuen main bacchon ko dhakelegaa, wo shikshak nahin hoga
 i have spoken to the school director, he has rebuked that teacher
 ab kisi bhi bachche ko kuen se nahin daraaya jayega
 'I was very happy again, my mind was beginning to study
 puure skool main wo ek aise vyakti the, jo sahi myne main shikshak the
 Even though he was able to teach only children up to 'second grade', he used to teach them that no one should ever forget his teaching
 isliye hamaare skool ke saare bacchon ke priy shikshak vahi the
 But in school, most of the teachers used to look at him as a peon, because he used to give children water
 mere saath padhane vaale bacchon ko aaj bhale hi apane shikshakon kaa naam yaad na ho lekin sipaahi ji jarur yaad honge
 His ideals are with me even today like my studies
 shikshak diwas par unako sadar naman

 The bjp's defeat has started attacking its allies
 shivasena ne bihar ke siem nitish kumaar ko badhai dete hue kaha ki is jeet ke saath vah ek raajnneetik hero ke rup main ubhare hai
 Shiv Sena spokesman Sanjay Raut blamed the loss on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, saying that just as Sonia Gandhi had the responsibility of defeating the Congress in the Lok Sabha elections, similarly the BJP should accept that Modi has the responsibility of losing in Bihar
 unhone kaha kibihar chunaavmodi ke naam par ladaa gaya, lekin sarvocch padon par baithe log bhashaa kaa khyaal nahin rakhte hai
