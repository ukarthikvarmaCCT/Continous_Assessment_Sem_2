 Bachha Rai, the main accused in the famous topper scandal of Bihar, was finally arrested by the police from Vaishali
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki vah khud hi aatmasarmapan karne aayaa tha
 The police was vigorously searching for Bachchan Rai
 baccha raay vishun raay college kaa principal he
 Arrested in Vaishali, the main accused of the topper scandal in Bihar, Bishna Rai, principal of Vishun Rai College, came to dodge the police and surrender but was arrested by the police
 police uski talash main lagaataar chhapemari kar rahi thi
 But he was not coming to the police
 uski talash main police ne kai logon se poochtacha kii
 And also raided all its possible targets
 baccha ne kaha 'nirdosh hum'giraftaar kiye jane ke baad topper cond ke mukhya aaropee amit urf baccha raay ne kaha ki wo bekasoor he
 He said that Larkeshwar had no connection with the case
 topper banane ke liye letaa tha 1 se 2 lakh rupabaccha raay ke karnaamon se vaishali ke log tang aa chuke the
 He says, 'bachcha Rai used to charge a lot of money to get the students topped
 vah iske liye 1 lakh se 2 lakh rupee tak letaa tha
 "also used to pay money for marksheets and certificates", RJD legislator said that "many times, Bachchan Rai did not give marksheets and certificates to children and used to charge huge amount in lieu of this
 agar koi chaatr kisi kii pairvi par aata to bhi baccha raay usase extra paise charge karata tha
 'we received complaints from many students and parents that Bachchan Rai is not giving their marksheets and certificates
 'baccha raay se argedy kaa koi rishta nahin'aregedy vidhayak subodh raay ne iske saath hi un daavon ko khaarij kiya, jisamen kaha gaya ki baccha raay purv main argedy kaa netaa rah chukaa he
 He said, 'he has no relation with RJD
 naa hi argedy pramukh lalu prasad yadav se hi koi link he
 ' dhan or sampatti kii adhishthatri devi hai - maan lakshmi
 He is believed to have been born from the sea, and was married to Shri Vishnu
 inaki puja se dhan kii prapti hoti he saath hi vaibhav bhi miltaa he
 If Lakshmi becomes angry then she has to face extreme poverty
 jyotish main shukr grah se inkaa sambandh joda jaataa he
 What are the fruits of his worship? - His worship not only gives wealth but also brings fame - his worship also makes married life better - no matter how much money is there, if Lakshmi ji is duly worshiped So what is the rule and precautions to worship Goddess Lakshmi? - Goddess Lakshmi should be worshiped in white or pink clothes - it is the best time to worship - Twilight Vela or Madha This night - worship the mother Lakshmi replica in which she is sitting on a pink lotus flower - with her hands showering money - it would be best to offer a pink flower especially a lotus to mother Lakshmi - chanting of the mantras of mother Lakshmi When done with the garland, it is immediately effective
 What should i do to get the blessings of Lord Lakshmi (to get money) in a special experiment business? - Business Laxmi in place, Establish Ganesh ji and Vishnu ji - Install Vishnu ji to the right of Lakshmi ji and Ganesh ji to the left - Offer him a rose flower before starting work in the morning - light a lamp of ghee and incense of rose fragrance
 What to do in order to get wealth? - In the place of worship, install a picture of Lakshmi ji sitting on a lotus flower - in this picture if the elephants from both the sides are filled with water, dropping water So it would be even better - light a lamp of ghee in the evening in front of this picture, and offer perfume to the mother - Surely blow a conch three times every evening after the end of worship
 afghanistan ke liye america ke vishesh pratinidhi jalme khalilzad ne kaha he ki afghanistan main shanti samjhaute kaa ek fremawork taiyaar ho gaya he
 He was in direct talks with the Taliban in Afghanistan for the past few weeks
 taliban ne hami bhari he ki alqaida or islamic state america ke khilaaf kii jane vaali gatividhiyon ke liye afgaan ilaake kaa istemaal nahin karenge or vah is baat ke bharosemand saboot degaa
 Instead, the US has agreed to call troops from Afghanistan in due time
 america kii yah bhi maang he ki taliban or afgaan suraksha balon ke bich sangharsh viraam or afgaan sarkaar ke saath ek rajnatik samjhauta vaarta ho
 The Taliban leadership's decision on these conditions is currently awaited
 taliban is atirikt samjhaute par do vajahon se raji ho saktaa he
 First, the proposed ceasefire would maintain its current domination in those Taliban-dominated districts
 afgaan sarkaar kaa niyantran mukhya shaharon or bade rajmargon par hi he, par vah bhi lagaataar khatre main he
 Second, the US has no insistence now that the Taliban, like other political parties, participate in elections and agree to share in governance under the Afghan Constitution
 khalilzad kaa kahana tha ki taliban kis rup main us satta tantra kaa hissaa banegaa, yah sarkaar or taliban ke bich kii baatcheet par nirbhar karegaa
 He is in control of a large part of Afghanistan and many districts and will demand authority over these areas, provinces and major ministries at the cost of this in the peace deal
 taliban kii apni sainya shakti he or pakistan kaa khulaa samarthan bhi
 Apparently, he will use the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan to America and other countries to further increase his strength and bypassing other political forces
 america shanti sainikon kii vaapasi ke baad taliban samjhaute kii sharton kaa ulanghan bhi kare to bhi america lautakar aayega, isaki sambhaavna bahut kam he
 For India, it will be like being caught in evil again
 phir hamaare pados kabul main ek pakistani asar vaali kattarpanthi sarkaar kaa andeshaa ban rahaa he jo bhartiya hiton ke liye khatra hogi
 All this is going to happen soon, so India will have to make a strategy soon
 ek tark yah bhi he ki bharat ko taliban ke saath samvaad kaa apana channel kholana chahie kyonki afgani rashtravaadi taliban bharat ko nuksaan pahunchane vaali pakistani cargujariyon main saath nahin denge
 This is unlikely because Pakistan is raising the Taliban in every situation due to India's 'threat'
 taliban ke afgani vyavastha main prabhavi bhoomika main aate hi pakistan apane usee puraani agenda ko lagu karegaa
 That is to reduce the Indian presence in Afghanistan and to use the Afghan land for terrorist operations against India
 or apni jameen surakshit rahane tak america ko khaas phikr nahin hone vaali
 The Chinese and Russians will rely on good relations with Pakistan to protect their interests
 iraniyon ko pados main ek kattarpanthi sunni shashan ke aa jane se thodi phikr sata sakati he
 Similarly, some other Central Asian countries like Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan may also have a slight headache
 kya aise main bharat ke paas yah gunjaaish he ki vah usee ke jaisi chintaa rakhane vaale aise deshon ke saath javaabi ranneeti par charchaa kar sake?pichley dedhek dashak main bharat afghanistan kaa na sirf ek pramukh aarthik saajheedaar bana he balki kai safal saamudayik or saamaajik kalyaan pariyojnaon ke chalate usne saamaajik sadbhaavna or lokapriyata arjeet kii he
 It has a political network with non-pashtun Northern Alliance partners and a better network in coordination with influential Pashtun political personalities
 afghanistan shashan main taliban kii vaapasi kaa andeshaa unako utsahit to nahin hi karegaa kyonki taliban kaa yun taqatvar hona unhen haashie par pahunchaa degaa
 Can India help them to become a united and weighty political force to stop this Taliban occupation? On this board in Afghanistan, the options for India's moves are difficult and the situation is largely inconvenient
 afghanistan ke sarkari balon kaa samarthan karne ke naam par sena bhejnaa budhimatta bharaa kadam nahin kaha ja saktaa lekin kisi str par sainya samarthan ko nishchit rup se badhaayaa janaa chahie
 Now the issue is that complete Taliban occupation of Afghanistan should be stopped, even if the government with Taliban presence has to bear it

 With so much emphasis from above, it is only natural that the states of India are fast growth driven by the growth of the state in the race to reach the top in terms of economic development and social welfare

 pehle kabhi jor bhrashtachar main mubtila hone kii suvidha par hua karata tha, iske bajaae aaj vah kaarobaari suvidha par aa gaya he
 According to the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), the performance of the states in the World Bank and the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP) Business Facilitation Index is a testimony to how well it has achieved in improving the investment climate in the last four years

 siiai ke president rakesh bharti mittal ne kaha, "desh main nivesh ko aasaan banane kii khatir centre or rajyon ke bich bhagidaari or sahakaari tathaa pratispardhi sanghavaad kii bhaavana behad shandaar nattejey de rahi he
 In this backdrop, India Today's state-direction study of states has become more relevant and present than before
 apane is 17wein saal main yah adhyayan hindustani rajyon ke kaamkaaj kaa samgr or majboot barometer banakar ubhara he
 This year, we increased the specialties of different categories (see the method of study) and after consulting with experts, we decided the importance and weightage of each category separately
 vibhinn shreniyon main kul 2,000 ankon par rajyon kaa moolyankan kiya gaya
 Even in the specialties, we set different importance and weight
 iske peeche daleel sidhi-saadi thi—agar vibhinn shreniyon ko samaan ahmiyat yaa bhaaransh diya jaataa he, to kuch nishchit rajyon ko aksar apane bhugolic or saamaajik karkon kaa anuchit phayda mil jaataa he
 For example, an industrial state like Maharashtra or Delhi may score less than Himachal Pradesh, Kerala or Assam in terms of environment
 lihaaja, is kism ke kisi bhi phaayde ko beasar karne ke liye un shreniyon ko zyada ahmiyat or bhaaransh diya gaya jinase rajya kii apni koshishon kii jhalak milti he
 This is not to say that the environment is even less important than other categories
 asal main paryaavaran ke maamle main rajyon kaa kaamkaaj hindustan main kahin zyada ahm ho gaya he, kyonki yel uniwarsity ke anvyranment parformens index 2018 main yah desh aaj vaishvik paryaavaran pradarshan suchakank (ipiai) ke behad nichle paaydaan par khadaa he

 2018 main yah phisalkar 177wein paaydaan par aa gaya
 When the national capital Delhi suffers due to lack of fresh air, Kolkata is emerging as one of the most polluted capitals and the second most polluted rivers of the country are flowing in Assam, then the environmental degradation is in certain cities, regions
 And it is not limited to the localities
 jab tak rajnatik netritv or saamaajik jaagrukta kandhe se kandhaa milakar kaam nahin karte, tab tak vikaas kaa koi matlab nahin hoga
 Sixteen years ago, when the India Today recognized the growing role of states in the radical transformation of India and started the ambitious task of measuring the growth rate of their growth, the Planning Commission set the roadmap for the country's growth
 rajya unheen yojanaon ke nakshekadam par chalate the jo centre banaata or tay karata tha
 Today, the states are the owners of their destiny, or at least they are moving in that direction
 centre or rajya kaa rishta ab daandaata or daan lene vaale kaa nahin rahaa balki usase alahada ho chukaa he
 Now it is a relationship of reward based on functioning
 asal main niti ayog ne centre sarkaar ke vaaste rajyon ke saath baante jane laayak karon ke bantwaare ke liye ek aise formule kii vakaalat kii he jo saamaajik vikaas ke paimaanon par acha pradarshan karne vaale rajyon ke hiton ke khilaaf na ho
 NITI Aayog Deputy Chairman Rajiv Kumar recently said, "I think it is clear that the formula (for sharing of taxes to the states) should be such that some of the work related criteria should be included so that those states are not punished
" Who have to work better on certain criteria
 '' haalanki ve aagaah karte hai ki yah raturaat nahin kiya ja saktaa or sangheey dhaanche main sansadhano ke bantwaare ko lekar siyaasi samvedansheeltaa ko dekhte hue ise aahista-aahista hi lagu karnaa hoga
 Non-equalization in the growth of states is one of the biggest challenges facing the country
 is gaiyr-baraabar vruddhi ne kai bahason or afasaanon ko janm diya he—uttar banaam dakshin, tateey banaam mukhya bhubhag, sthir sarkaar banaam baar-baar badalati hukuumaten
 However, development does not always follow the path of these two couples, as India Today's state-direction study has shown on several occasions
 masalan, tamaam shreniyon main sabase zyada baar sheersh 10 main aane vaale rajya—tamilnadu, karnataka, haryana, himachal pradesh, gujarat or maharashtra—tamaam ilaakon main takreeban ek samaan tarakkee darshaate hai
 Of course, there is a serious reason for concern: the two big states of the East - West Bengal and Odisha: have not been able to top any of the 12 categories
 haalanki josh badhaane vaali baat he sabase zyada sudhaar laane vaale rajyon kii ranking
 States that have traditionally been in the category of "best performing states" have shown the fastest growth in the last five years
 sabase zyada sudhaar laane vaale sheersh saat rajyah assam, jammu-kashmir, madhya pradesh, uttar pradesh, chhattisgarh, jharkhand or bihar—sabase acha pradarshan karne vaale rajyon main bilkul nichle paaydaan par hai
 Critics will undoubtedly say that their growth rate looks good because they started from a very low base
 magar isse is hakeekat se munh nahin modaa ja saktaa ki ye phiseddi rajya apni sthiti ko badalane ke liye joardaar or bahadurana koshish kar rahe hai
 This is the reason that sick states like Bihar and Madhya Pradesh are achieving a growth rate of around 10 per cent, which is often higher than economic giants like Maharashtra and Punjab
 puduccheri sareekha adana-sa rajya lagaataar 10 fisadi se zyada vruddhi dar se bad rahaa he
 It has been difficult for the states that have traditionally topped the list to be able to match the growth rate of the newly emerging states
 isiilie india today ke rajyon kii dasha-disha adhyayan ke liye jin 31 rajyon or centreshasit pradeshon kii padtaal kii gai, unamem se 27 bahut-si shreniyon main inaam hasil karte dekhakar utsaah badhata he
 Yet this is only the beginning
 ilaakai gaiyr-barabari ke alaawaaru jahaan dakshini or pashchimi bharat vruddhi ke mukhya ingine rahe hai, jabaki uttar raftaar pakad rahaa he, magar purab ab bhi niraashajanak pradarshan kar rahaa he—asli vishaal khai shahari or gramin bharat ke bich he
 Indian cities account for about 65 per cent of India's GDP
 behatar pradarshan karne vaale rajyon main bhi kuch hi shahar hai jo vruddhi ko aage le ja rahe hai
 The result of this lack of rural development is the crisis of migration or migration, the latest example of which is Gujarat
 desh ke bheetar is pravaas yaa palaayan ke pattern kaa adhyayan karne vaale 2016-17 ke aarthik surveykshan ke mutabik, kam daulatmand rajyon se bahari-palaayan'' kahin zyada hua he, jabaki in rajyon se sabase badi taadaad main log sabase zyada daulatmand rajyon main gaye hai
 Consequently, South Indian states like Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Kerala have attracted the largest number of migrants
 madhya pradesh, bihar or uttar pradesh se bahari palaayan kii dar badi he
 More than half the migrants are from these two states
 aarthik surveykshan 2016-17 ke mutabik, 2016 tak paanch saal main ausatan nabbe lakh log har saal talim yaa kaam ke vaaste ek se duusare rajya main gaye
 This is almost double the inter-state migration between 2001-2011 recorded in the 2011 census
 dilachasp yah he ki assam main bahari palaayan main kami ai he, jo shaayad rajya main badhate avasaron kaa parichaayak he
 It has become the most improved state in the last five years based on its performance in all 12 categories
 pichley hafte india today se assam ke mukhyamantri sarbanand sonoval ne daawa kiya ki nijee companiyon ne beete do saal main kareeb ek lakh naukariyaan di hai
 The government has hired 55,000 people
 badakismati se hindustan ke kai rajyon main pravaasiyon ke khilaaf aksar jhadpen hui hai
 But the reality is that due to migrants, the sources of socio-economic unity are also being tied
 masalan, surat main shahar kii kaamkaaji aabaadi main baahar se aae log 70 fisadi hai
 More than 120 special schools have opened for the migrants in Surat
 aisi hi kahaniyaan hindustan kii tarakkee main eendhan kaa kaam karti hai or india today kaa rajyon kii dasha-disha adhyayan aisi hi prerak baton kaa jashn manaata he

 Rangarasiya is going to release on this Diwali after six years, but it seems that Ketan Mehta's path to release this film is not so easy
 yah film mashhoor chitrakaar raja ravi verma ke jivan par aadhaarit he
 It is reported that Nandana Sen, the heroine of the New York-settled film, got married to Ketan Mehta and created a new difficulty in the film promotion
 is baat se sabhi waakif hai ki film main raja ravi verma bane randeep hooda or unki prerana sugandha bai baniin nandana sen ke bich kai antarang drishy hai, jo shooting ke dauraan hi charchaa kaa vishay bane the
 Sources from the film say that in view of those intimate scenes, there is no obstacle in their married happy life at the moment, for this, Nandana Sen has offered a No Objection Certificate from Ketan Mehta before the poster release
 saath hi unka yah bhi farmaan he ki unki anumati ke bina mekars poster par unki koi antarang tasviir nahin jari kar sakate
 There has been no conversation between Nandana and Ketan ever since Nandana Sen is settled in New York, marrying the famous New York publisher John mckinson
 ab jab rangarasia ke jariye kethan mehta ne unnisvin sadi ke mashhoor painter raja ravi verma or unki prerana sugandha bai kii prem kahani ko is diwaali darshakon ke saamne laane kaa faisla kiya he to film ke naye poster ko relies karne ke liye unke paas nandana ke mumbai lautne kaa intjaar karne ke alaava or koi chaara nahin rah gaya he
 However, it is also considered a sensible move for Nandana as she would think that Ketan could go to any lengths to promote his film which is going to be released after six years
 jab chah saal pehle kethan ne yah film banaai thi tab nandana is baat se itani pareshaan nahin thim
 He said at the time, "nudity can be shown in two forms
 agar aap nari ke sharir ko upbhog kii vastu ke rup main dikhaate hai to yah nari kaa apmaan he lekin rang rasiyaa main nari sharir ke jariye nari shakti ko dikhaaya gaya he

 Let us tell you that this statement of Donald Trump has come after meeting Modi two weeks ago

 US President Donald Trump said that everyone is aware that there is a dispute between India and Pakistan about Kashmir from the very beginning
 mujhe lagata he ki do saptaah pehle kii tulana main maahaul ab thik he
 He said that i have spoken to both the countries
 agar donon desh chahen to main unki madad kar saktaa hum
 Donald Trump said this to reporters at the Whitehouse
 gauratlab he ki kuch din pehle hi donald trump ne kashmir vivaad ke niptaare ke liye donon deshon ke bich madhyasth banane kii baat bhi kahi thi
 US President Donald Trump had offered 'mediation' between India and Pakistan on the Kashmir issue
 pakistani pradhanmantri imran khan ne white house main trump se pehali baar mulaakaat kii jahaan donon netaaon ne kai muddon par charchaa kii thi
 The Indian government denied the shocking claim of US President Trump that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had asked him to mediate on Kashmir

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has not made any such request to the US President
 'ab america ke videsh mantralay ne twit karte hue kaha thaki kashmir ek divpaksheeya mudda he or donon pakshon ko is par charchaa kerani chahie
 The tweet reads, 'kashmir is a bilateral issue, which both sides should discuss
 trump prashasan swaagat karata he bharat or pakistan kii vaarta kaa or america hameshaa madad karne ke liye taiyaar he

 pakistan ke saath kisi bhi baatcheet ke liye seemapar aatankwaad par roak jaruri hogi
 Compliance of the Simla Agreement and the Lahore Manifesto will be the basis for resolving all issues between India and Pakistan
 ' trump ne daawa kiya tha ki pradhanmantri modi ne unase kashmir mudde par madhyasthata karne ko kaha tha
 The US President claimed that Modi and he had discussed the Kashmir issue on the sidelines of the G-20 summit in Osaka, Japan last month where Indian Prime Minister Modi offered him third-party mediation on Kashmir
 trump ne kaha tha ki main do saptaah pehle pradhanmantri modi ke saath tha or hamane is vishay (kashmir) par baat kii thi
 And they actually said, 'would you like to be a mediator or arbitrator?' i said, 'where?' (modi said) 'kashmir

 Pyari Vyapam's Building, Comments tum to bahut hi ghunni nikaleen
 
 
 Ever since my childhood, i never know how many times i have passed in front of you, sitting back on my father's scooter and then driving my scooty
 lekin sach bataaun to maine kabhi bhi tumhen bhav nahin diya
 Today, i have become like a girl in the village, who never thought that the 'lallu' boy in her locality, whom she did not even think to look at, would one day become a star
 tum to mere or mere doston ke liye aksar landmark hi banakar raheen, lekin mujhe kya pataa tha ki tum to benchmark set kar dogi
 And yes, that Gupta aunt's girl, who used to come to work with you daily, also used to take her seriously
 
 
 ? vaise usne ek baar bataaya tha ki vah vyaapman main aane vaale pariksha formon kii scrutini karti he
 He had also told that boys and girls studying there are also doing the work of checking the form
 ab bechaare medical or ejineering kii pariksha dene vaale ko kahaan pataa hoga ki unka form kisi aathvin paas ne riject kar diya
 By the way, today my sister was also talking about you
 usne sirf ek baar piiti (pre-ejineering test) kii pariksha di thi, jisamen vah ek yaa do nahin, kai number se peeche rah gai thi
 After reading this news about you, she used to say "i-don't-say" in the first leisure
 
 
 ?" kii dhun main apane paas na hone kaa dosha is ghotaale par madh diya, lekin main achche-se jaanati hum ki meri didi ne padhai ke naam par sirf dhong kiya he, isliye chintaa mat karo, uske maamle main tum meri taraf se bari ho
 But yes, i also had another friend, who spent five-six years of her life just taking the medical examination
 itane saal tak college se drop lekar vah sirf doctor banane ke apane sapane ko puraa karne main juty rahi
 Despite doing one day and night, when he was not selected in the medical entrance examination, he deemed himself well
 aisa bilkul ho saktaa he ki uski mehnat main kuch kami rah gai ho, lekin soch rahi hum, tumhaari khabar sunakar uske jaise kai log ek baar ke liye hi sahi, flashbek main zarur gaye honge
 For a long time, i did not even try to know what the problem is
 
 
 ? yah bhi nahin pataa tha ki vyavsaayik pariksha mandal ke pyaar kaa naam hi vyaapman he
 Although i have never dealt with professional examinations, but i would often hear friends of Mathematics and Science say, "brother
 
 
 agar vyaapman main kuch 'jugad' he to kuch baat ban sakati he
 
 
 "never thought that you have so much buried under that jugaad
 baaki jagahon kii tarah bhopal main bhi jugad ke ye kaam hi chhutbhaiye netaaon ke liye training ground hote the
 Well, what to ask about the street which is not known, so i never kept the addresses of Vyapam, but i knew a lot about the Chinar Park in front of it
 jaise vahaan kooday-kachare kaa istemaal karke kuch kalakritiyaan banaai gai thim, jinaki aad main jode pyaar kaa kachra karne par tule rahete the
 But Vyapam, the real waste was happening within you
 un bacchon ke sapanom kaa kachra, jo bina kisi jugad yaa conection ke doctorl kii pariksha dene kii jurrat kar baithe the
 Come on, after such a big storm you too will change a lot
 pehali fursat main thodaa rang-rogan karvaa lenaa, kyonki ab tum sirf landmark nahin raheen
 Now Zarda will show his riders of the auto-station or airport in the mouth, "see, Madam, this was where the Vyapam scam happened
 
 
 " Happy Vyapam's Building
 
 
 tum to femes ho gayi
 
 
 You turned out to be very miserable
 
 
 bachapan se lekar aadhi javaani tak kabhi papa ke scooter par peeche baithkar or baad main apni skuti chalaate hue pataa nahin kitni baar main tumhaare saamne se guzari hum
 But to tell the truth, i have never given you a feeling
 aaj meri haalat gaanv kii us ladki jaisi ho gai he, jisane kabhi nahin sochaa tha ki uske mohalle kaa vah 'lallu' ladkaa, jisaki taraf vah dekhnaa bhi zaruri nahin samajhati thi, ek din star ban jayega
 You have often been a landmark for me and my friends, but what i knew was that you would set a benchmark
 or haa, vah gupta antee kii ladki, jo tumhaare yahaan rose kaam karne aati thi, usko bhi main kahaan syriasli leti thi
 
 
 The By the way, she once told that she scrutinizes the examination forms coming in Vyapam
 usne yah bhi bataaya tha ki vahaan na ke baraabar padhai kiye ladke-ladkiyaan bhi form check karne kaa kaam karte hai
 Now the poor medical and engineering examiner will know where his eighth pass has been rejected
 vaise, aaj tumhaare bare main meri didi se bhi baat ho rahi thi
 She had given the PET (pre-engineering test) test only once, in which she was lagged behind by several numbers, not one or two
 tumhaare bare main yah khabar padhakar usne pehali fursat main "main-na-kahati-thi
 
 
 ? "to the tune of not possessing the blame, i put the blame on this scam, but i know very well that my sister has only pretended in the name of studies, so don't worry, in her case you get acquitted on my behalf Ho
 lekin haa, meri ek or saheli bhi thi, jisane apni zindagi ke paanch-chah saal sirf medical kii pariksha dene main bitaa die
 For so many years, she was just fulfilling her dream of becoming a doctor by taking a drop from college
 din-raat ek karne ke baavjood jab uskaa medical kii pravesh pariksha main chayan nahin hua to usne khud ko jaise-taise samajha liya
 It may be that there is something missing in his hard work, but i am thinking, after listening to your news, many people like him must have gone in flashbacks, right for once
 bahut time tak to maine yah jaanane kii koshish hi nahin kii ki aakhir yah vyaapman he kya bhalaa
 
 
 The It was also not known that Vyapam is the name of the love of the professional examination board
 vaise vyavsaayik parikshaon se meraa vaasta kabhi nahin rahaa, lekin ganit or science ke doston ko aksar kehete sunati thi, "bhai
 
 
 If there is some 'jugaad' in Vyapam then some talk can be made
 
 
 " kabhi nahin sochaa tha ki us jugad ke neeche tumne itnaa kuch gaadkar rakhaa hua he
 Like other places, these jobs of jugaad in Bhopal used to be training grounds for the liberated leaders
 kair, jis gali janaa nahin, uskaa pataa kya poochna, isliye maine bhi vyaapman ke ate-pate kabhi nahin rakhe, lekin uske saamne jo chinar park tha, uske bare main kaaphi pataa rahata tha
 For example, some artworks were made by using garbage, under whose garb the couple were bent on trashing love
 lekin vyaapman, asal kachra to tumhaare bheetar hi ho rahaa tha
 The garbage of the dreams of those children, who were sitting at the juncture of giving medical examination without any jugaad or connection
 chalo, ab itane bade tufaan ke baad tum bhi kaaphi badal jaaogi
 Get a little color in the first time, because now you are not just a landmark

 bayaan main is baat par jor diya gaya ki suraksha parishad main sudhaar ke bare main sanyukt raashtra main chal rahi prakriya ko tay samay seemaa ke bheetar puraa kiya janaa chahie
 Needing double efforts for concrete results, the G-4 expressed concern that no concrete progress had been made since the 2005 global conference, wherein all heads of state and governments unanimously agreed on the essential element of reforming the United Nations
 As soon as the Security Council supported the reform
 11 varsh pehle bane is samooh ke netaaon ne apane deshon ko suraksha parishad kaa sthaayee sadsy banaae jane kii muhim ko milakar aage badhaate hue mahasabha ke 70wein adhiveshan main is bare main thos nateezon ko paane ke liye apane prayaason ko doguna karne kii patibaddhta vyakt kii

 The G-4 statement confirmed that these countries expressed their resolve to continue contributing towards fulfilling the objectives and principles of the United Nations Declaration
 videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa vikaas swaroop ne twit kiya ki G-4 ne gati pai he or japan, germany brazil or bharat ke netaa sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad main sudhaar kii jarurat par dhyaan kendrit kar paa rahe hai

 Due to huge loot of private sector in health sector and lack of health infrastructure in government sector, good quality treatment remains a dream for the poor
 haalanki piem modi dwaara pichley kaarykaal main hi dakhal kii vajah se is sthiti main kuch had tak badlaav aayaa he
 The Modi government has made several good efforts towards providing better health services to the poor
 inhen main se ek he, sasti dawaaon or upkarnon kii uplabdhta, lekin is sector main abhi kaaphi kaam karne kii jarurat he
 It remains to be seen what further steps Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman takes to bring high-level treatment to the pockets of the poor
 dawaaon kii keemton par niyantranmodi sarkaar ne jeevanarakshak dawaaon kii keemton par kaaphi had tak niyantran kaayam kiya he
 The National Pharmaceutical Price Authority (NPPA) currently fixes the prices of medicines placed in the National List of Essential Medicines under Schedule-1 of DPCO
 abhi tak kareeb 1000 dawaaon ko price control ke daayre main laayaa ja chukaa he
 Non-schedule drugs are allowed to increase the price by 10% every year
 in par bhi najar rakhi jaati he
 Apart from this, the government has given big relief to more than 22 lakh cancer patients of the country once again
 ab sarkaar ne 390 cancer dawaaon ko mulya niyantran main laakar sasta kar diya he
 With this decision, cancer drugs will be available at 87 percent lower prices
 'bajet 2019 kii vistrut kawarej ke liye yahaan clic karen'munafkhori par chotsarkaar kritrim ghutane or stant ke daamon ko bhi niyantrit kar chuki he or inke daam kaaphi neeche aa gaye hai
 PM Modi repeatedly talks about how the price of stents has come down drastically
 heart ko rakt kii aapurti durust karne vaale cardiek stant kii keemat tay karne vaale rashtriya aushadhi mulya praadhikaran (enpipie) ke farvari, 2017 ke aadesh se modi sarkaar kii lokapriyata kaaphi badi thi
 This led to a steep fall in the price of stents
 farvari, 2017 ko stant kii keemat ko bear metal stant (bmes) ke liye 7,260 or drug alutting stant (deies) ke liye 29,600 rupee tay kar die
 Prior to that, bare metal stents cost an average of Rs 45,000 and drug eluting stents averaged 1
 2 lakh rupee main mil rahaa tha
 In this way huge profits were being made from 270 percent to 1,000 percent on it
 iske alaava garibon ko sasti dawaaen muhaiyaa karne ke liye pradhanmantri jan aushadhi centre khole gaye hai
 Now what can happen next? Now, to give great relief to the patients across the country, the government has made preparations to bring all types of implants in the human body into the medicine category
 is faisle ke baad sarkaar ko pesamekar, heart volve, lens se lekar artificial hip sahit kareeb 400 se zyada tarah ke implants ko regulate karne kaa adhikaar mil jayega
 With this, the price of these devices can be reduced by around 50 percent
 jiesti se aise kai upkarnon ke daam pehle hi bad gaye hai
 In such a situation, it has become mandatory for the government to take relief measures
 yahi nahin, ab sarkaar ne medical divises (emarai, city scan, eks-re sahit anya chikitsiya upkaran) kii keemat ko bhi regulate karne kii taiyaari kar rahi he
 The NPPA, the price-setting body, determines only the price of life-saving drugs
 desh main dawaaon kaa gharelu udyog kareeb 1 lakh karod kaa he jiskaa sirf 17 fisadi hi keemat niyantran ke daayre main he
 Therefore, preparations are being made to rein in the prices of medicines sold over the counter without a prescription

 Underworld don Abu Salem, who is serving life imprisonment in the Mumbai serial force blast case, is now beating his hands to get out of India
 usne portugal kii ek adaalat main ek yachika daayar kii he or thode samay ke liye hi sahi portugal le jaae jane kii maang kii he
 Significantly, India has obtained extradition of Abu Salem from Portugal on the basis of a treaty
 abu salem ne apane vakil manuel louis farera ke jariye 31 may ko portugal kii adaalat main yah yachika lagaai he
 Abu Salem, convicted of plotting terrorist conspiracies in the 1993 Mumbai serial blasts, has also been convicted of seeking ransom from a Delhi-based businessman
 abu salem isse pehle bhi bharat se nikalne kii koshish kar chukaa he
 She also petitioned a Portugal court in December 2014, stating that the conditions for her extradition were being violated, so she should be sent back to Lisbon
 lekin is bich bharat sarkaar ne bhi karrwai tej kar di
 India said in the context of a previous petition by Abu Salem that since the Indian Ambassador in Portugal had diplomatic immunity, there was no need for him to testify in the case
 bataa den ki bharat main niyukt portugal ke rajdoot ne haal hi main taloja jail main abu salem ko ek patr bheja he, jisamen abu salem ko aashwast kiya gaya he ki uske pratyrpan kii sharton kaa ulanghan na ho, is disha sabhi kadam uthaae ja rahe hai

 pehali baar aisi sweekaaroktiyah pehali baar he jab pakistan ke kisi adhikari ne parmaanu hathiyaaron ko lekar is tarah kaa bayaan diya he
 It is also his bizarre confession about his decision that he is making nuclear weapons to counter India's possible attack
 isse pehle america think tanks ne kaha tha ki2020 tak pakistan ke paas 200 parmaanu hathiyaar honge
 Chaudhary said this before Pakistani PM Sharif's visit to America
 unhone kaha ki pakistan america ke saath kisi bhi tarah kaparmaanu qaraar nahinkaregaa
 Sharif is arriving in Washington on Wednesday

 What is the 'cold Start Principle' Actually, it is a military strategy
 pakistan se yuddh kii sthiti main turant javaabi karrwai kii ranneeti
 Its main objective is to give Pakistan a proper answer before the international community can mediate
 lekin pakistan ko parmaanu hamale ke liye uksaae bina

 This is the reason that year to year the number of tourists in Ayodhya is increasing by two to five percent
 yahi nahin desh ke alag-alag hisson se bhi kareeb sava karod log yahaan aate hai
 On the other hand, the website 'trip Advisor India' has left no stone unturned to create fear in the mind of the tourists visiting this place

 And this thing is being given to people all over the world
 19 farvari 2014 ko rivizd is website main bataaya he ki agar aap tourist hai or dharmik aasthaa vaale nahin hai, to kripaya ayodhya ko mat dekhen
 Since the disputed structure was demolished here in 1992, Ayodhya has been kept under full security

 Apart from Ramjanmabhoomi in Ayodhya, Maniramdas has a camp, Kanak Bhavan and Sita Kitchen as attractions

 In this regard, Regional Tourism Officer Brijraj Singh says that 'ayodhya is on the tourism map and authorized information is available on the Internet'
 unhone kaha ki 'website kii galat soochnaaon kaa paryatakon par koi asar nahin hota
 The correct information about Ayodhya can be obtained from the website of UP Tourism '

 This action was taken about a week ago

 According to the Chhattisgarh Commercial Tax Department official, this action has been taken against Pan Masala businessman of Uttar Pradesh
 is kaarobaari ne trek main paan masala bharva kar chhattisgarh ke ambikapur ke liye ravaanaa kiya tha
 But in the invoice found with the goods, the businessman had cut the goods bill from Gorakhpur in Uttar Pradesh to Odisha

 Hakim said that Amit Shah ji dreams every day
 apni party kaa utsaah bachaae rakhane ke liye vah yahaan jhuthe vaade karte hai
 They know that this is not possible because in 2019 the BJP will run out of the entire country
 tab pashchim bengal main yah kaise sambhav he
 On the organization of BJP rallies in West Bengal, Hakeem said that the organizers are not really telling the truth that the BJP has no meaning here
 sab bekaar he
 They do not work for people

 He said that since the cpi-m's vote in Bengal was transferred to the BJP, he got a few percent votes
 abhi tak yahaan jo bhi chunaav hue hai usamen bijepi ko trinmul congress (TMC) se kam hi vot mili hai
 This clearly means that those who are seeing their interest in BJP every day, are also doing their harm

 In its basic form, the law through Section 57 allows state and private entities to use the infrastructure to establish an individual's identity
 puttaswami main, supreme court ko is tarah ke upyog kii anumati dene ke khataron kaa abhas tha or aadhaar adhinium ke anya bhaagon ko barkaraar rakhte hue bhi usne sarvasammati se dhara 57 ko asanvaidhanik ghoshit kiya tha
 Justice A
 ke
 Sikri wrote, "even if we believe that the legislature does not intend to do so (section 57), the effect will be such that private institutions will get the opportunity to commercially use an individual's biometric and demographic information
 '' adaalat ne mahasoos kiya, is tarah ke upyog kii anumati dene main, yah kanoon sidhe in vyaktiyon kii gopneeyata kaa ulanghan karegaa
 The new proposed amendment denies the court's conclusion
 yah kahata bhale hi ise 'svaichhik' he lekin vyaavhaarik rup se naagarikta par aadhaar ko thopane kaa kaam karata he
 After analyzing it deeply, the truth of the government claim becomes clear
 nae vidheyak main, jo jald hi kanoon ban jayega, aadhaar dekhne main to 'svaichhik' lagata he kyonki isamen nijee companiyon ko pahchaan satyapit karne ke liye iske upyog se pehle upabhokta kii 'sahmati' lene kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 But with this, the Bill allows the use of Aadhaar as a 'KYC' document by amending both the Telegraph Act which applies to mobile phone operators and the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, which applies to banks
 passport hi keval ek anya dastavej he jiskaa upyog ab apni pahchaan sthapit karne ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 In this we are not counting the documents that the government can notify in future
 is prakaar aadhaar ko vyaavhaarik rup se anivaary banane se data kii gopneeyata ke ulanghan kaa jokhim badhata he, ek aisa jokhim jo keval swatantra niamak niyantran kii kami se badhegaa or yah sachaai he ki hamaare paas abhi bhi koi data suraksha kanoon nahin he
 In view of the Supreme Court's response to Section 57, it was pledged that this platform would not be allowed to open the way for commercial exploitation and the government also assured that the Aadhaar would not be mandated, the new amendment would call it Constitutionally opens the doors to be challenged
 supreme court ke faisle kii avhelnaa karne or dhara 57 ko vyavhaarik rup main nae tareeke se phir se lagu karne kii koshish, niztaa ke us adhikaar kii guarantee par prahaar he jise ab moulik adhikaar mana gaya he
 At the same time, the lack of practical provisions related to bringing even those who are outside the purview of government schemes due to lack of Aadhaar, gives sufficient grounds to challenge this future law again in the Supreme Court

 On this occasion, the heads of groups like Birla, Reliance and Adani, who reached the capital Lucknow, said in one clear word that they are announcing big investments for Uttar Pradesh because without putting Uttar Pradesh at the center of economic activities, India should be placed in the world
 At the level, economic power cannot be created
 china bhi apane bade rajyon ke sahare bana aarthik shaktiduniya kii sabase badi aarthik shakti china susti ke daur se guzar rahaa he
 Some of its provisions have played an important role in making China an economic powerhouse having recorded a growth rate of 10 per cent for 30 consecutive years
 desh kii jidipi main in rajyon kaa sarvaadhik yogadan bhi he
 The special thing is that by looking at the economic data, it is clear that these provinces are the most densely populated areas of China and with this dense population, China has succeeded in becoming the world's largest economy

 lihaaja isi tarj par chalate hue ab uttar pradesh ko desh kaa ahm vanijyik kshetra banaaya jayega
 Uttar Pradesh is the most populous state in India by population
 lihaaja bharat ke liye china jaisi arthvyavastha ko pakadaney or use pachhaadne ke liye jaruri he ki bharat main bhi aarthik vikaas ke kendra main uttar pradesh ko rakhaa jaae
 Read this: Will Yogi's branding shine like Modi's Gujarat? Know what are the plans These companies will make UP an industrial hub? Speaking from the platform of UP Investors Summit, the big industrialists of the country have claimed thousands of crores investment in next few years as well as creating millions of new jobs in the state

 Gautam Adani, the head of the Adani Group, who is attending the summit, has claimed a total investment of Rs 45,000 crore for the expansion of his companies in the state over the next few years
 inke alaava kai kshetron main videshi companiyon ne uttar pradesh ke evester summit ke dauraan rajya main bade nivesh kaa elaan kiya he
 Significantly, in the dairy sector, companies in Europe, including the Netherlands, have signed an agreement for investment of thousands of crores by making almost 500 agreements

 3
 Pakistan claims that 46-year-old Kulbhushan Jadhav is an agent of Indian intelligence agency RAW and used to spy in Pakistan
 sachai yah he ki jadhav iran main apana kaarobaar karte the
 He is neither an agent of Raw nor involved in any type of espionage
 4
 Pakistan alleges that Jadhav is still employed in the Indian Navy, while India says that Jadhav has retired from the Navy
 5

 bharat ne iske liye 16 baar pakistan se apil kii
 3
 pakistan main germany ke rajdoot rahe doctor mulack ne kaha ki pakistan jadhav ko faansee dekar aag main tel daalane kaa kaam na kare
 When Jadhav was arrested, Dr
 Mulac was stationed in Pakistan
 4
 It is being told that the Taliban kidnapped Jadhav and handed over to Pakistan's intelligence agency ISI
 5
 Pakistan heard the Jadhav case so fast that no one got any time, while the Mumbai attack hearing is constantly being deferred
 6
 Pakistan did not give visa to Jadhav's family
 7
 Jadhav was not provided with a lawyer to present his case
 8
 Chargesheet of Jadhav case was not submitted to India
 9
 No health information of the former Indian Navy officer was given
 10
 Jadhav was sentenced to death without trial
 11
 The Pakistani army's press release revealed the death penalty in the Jadhav case
 antarrashtriya nyaayalay main bharat kii apil1
 Pakistan should provide legal help to Jadhav and do not violate human rights
 saath hi faansee par roak lagaae
 2
 antarrashtriya nyaayalay ke daayre main rahakar pakistan jadhav masale par faisla le
 3
 pakistan aisa koi kadam na uthaae, jisase bharat kii samprabhutaa, jadhav kii garima or antarrashtriya adaalat ke sammaan ko chot pahunche
 4
 pakistan bhartiya rajanyik ko jadhav se milane kii ijaajat de or unako bharat ko saunpa jaae

 Due to the service department being made under the Deputy Governor, guest teachers could not be appointed and new teachers were appointed
 3
 Not being under the services department, the government could not appoint doctor paramedical and nursing staff to run many newly created Mohalla clinics
 4
 Since the anti-corruption Branch was brought under the Lieutenant Governor, the government has not been able to take any action against the corrupt employees and officials, leading to increased corruption in the government

 Why did he go to jail In the 1993 Mumbai blasts case, Sanjay Dutt was tried under the TADA and Arms Act
 tada ke aaropon se sanjay bari ho gaye the lekin arms ekt ke tahat unhen court ne 6 saal kii sajaa sunai thi
 The Supreme Court has handed over all the cases of the Vyapam scam to the CBI, and with this the burden of another file fell on the 'responsible' shoulders of the CBI
 lagbhag har bada maamla jab pechida ho jaataa he, to use sibiai kii taraf mode diya jaataa he, so, aakhir yah sibiai he kya
 
 
 The central beuro of investigeshan, yani sibiai bharat kii sabase ahm jaanch agency he, jo bharat sarkaar ke antargat kaam karti he
 The CBI was established in 1941 as a 'special Police Establishment' for the purpose of overseeing internal security, and in 1963 the name of the institution was changed to CBI
 gauratlab he ki sabase ahm jaanch agency hone ke baavjood sibiai kii raahen kabhi aasaan nahin raheen, or lagbhag har badi jaanch ke dauraan uski nishpakshta ko lekar sawaal khadey hue
 Only last year, the Supreme Court rebuked the CBI in the context of the coal scam investigation, calling it a 'cage parrot', which only speaks of its 'owner'
 court ke mutabik, sibiai aisa tota he, jiske kai maalik hai
 The interesting thing was that many people appeared to agree with this comment of the court
 yahi nahin, haal hi main supreme court ne yah bhi kaha ki sibiai ke purv nideshak ranjit sinha ke khilaaf pad ke durupyog ke maamle main jaanch honi hi chahie
 Sinha is accused of not only meeting the accused in the coal scam while in office, but also sharing information related to the investigation with him
 duusari ore, rajnatik hastkshep ke aarope or aalochanaon se ghiri sibiai ke hisse main kuch safaltaaen bhi hai, jinaki charchaa hoti rahi hai
 Uttar Pradesh's NHRM scam took place a few years ago, in which the CBI made some significant arrests

 tippaniyan Facing all kinds of political hurdles, it is not an easy task to carry out any investigation and perhaps this is why there has been a demand for the CBI to become an autonomous body
 2013 main supreme court kii kadi tippaniyon ke baad upie sarkaar ne sibiai kii swaittata ke liye shapathpatr bhi daakhil kiya tha, jisamen sanstha ko sarkari prabhaav se mukt rakhane ke upaay shaamil the
 Now the question arises whether the current government will take some more steps in this or whether this parrot will still continue to speak the owner's bid to straighten its political owl
 
 
 ? The Central Bureau of Investigation, or the CBI, is India's most important investigative agency, which functions under the Government of India
 sibiai kii sthapana 1941 main ‘special police ysteblishment’ ke taur par aantarik suraksha kii dekharekh ke uddeshy se kii gai thi, or 1963 main sanstha kaa naam badalakar sibiai rakh diya gaya
 Significantly, despite being the most important investigative agency, the cbi's road has never been easy, and questions were raised about its impartiality during almost every major investigation
 pichley saal hi supreme court ne koyala ghotaale kii jaanch ke sandarbh main sibiai ko fatkaarte hue use 'pinjre main band tote' kii sangya di thi, jo sirf apane 'maalik' kii boli bolta he
 According to the court, the CBI is a parrot that has many owners
 dilachasp baat yah thi ki court kii is tippanee se bahut-se log sahamat hote dikhaai die
 Not only this, recently the Supreme Court also said that there should be an inquiry against former CBI Director Ranjit Sinha in the case of misuse of office
 sinha par aarope he ki unhone pad par rahete hue na keval koyala ghotaale se jude aropiyon se mulaakaat kii, balki unke saath jaanch se judi jaankariyaan bhi saajha kin
 On the other hand, there are also some successes on the part of the CBI surrounded by allegations and criticisms of political interference, which have been discussed
 kuch saal pehle hua uttar pradesh kaa enecharem ghotaalaa, jisamen sibiai ne kuch ahm giraftaaryaan kii thim
 Many politicians and officials were caught in the scandal during Mayawati's chief ministership and had to go to jail
 uttar pradesh main yah pehla aisa ghotaalaa tha, jisane rasookh vaale kai logon ko salaakhon ke peeche pahunchaa diya tha
 Sukhram, who was the Telecom Minister in the cabinet of former Prime Minister PV Narasimha Rao, was also caught in the CBI circle
 varsh 1998 main sibiai kii taraf se daayar kii gai chargeshit main sukhram or unke ek sahyogi par teen lakh rupee kii rishwat lene or taar kharidne main dhaandhlee karne kaa aarope lagaaya gaya tha, jiske baad sukhram ko dilli kii ek adaalat ne paanch saal kii sazaa sunai thi
 Though 86-year-old Sukhram sought exemption in sentence citing age, the CBI had appealed for strict punishment, calling him a habitual offender
 isi saal sibiai kii ek vishesh adaalat ne purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh ko koyala khadaan ke aavanton main hue kathith ghotaale se jude ek maamle main talab kiya tha, haalanki manmohan singh ke pradhanmantritv kaal main sibiai aisa karne kii himmat nahin juta pai thi
 The comments tamaam tarah ke rajnatik rodon kaa saamana karte hue kisi bhi jaanch ko anjaam tak pahunchaana aasaan kaam nahin he or shaayad isiilie sibiai ko ek swytt sanstha (autonomous body) banane kii maang hoti rahi he
 In 2013, the UPA government had also filed an affidavit for autonomy of the CBI following stringent comments by the Supreme Court, which included measures to keep the institution free from government influence
 ab sawaal yah uthta he ki kya vartmaan sarkaar is bare main kuch or kadam uthaaegi yaa apana rajnatik ullu sidhaa karne ke liye yah tota ab bhi maalik kii boli bolta hi rah jayega

 " supreme court aaj dilli ko lekar aitihaasik faisla sunaane vaala he
 The fight for rights is going on between Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and Delhi Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal
 agar aaj supreme court kaa faisla arvind kejariwal ke paksh main aata he to kejariwal ko wo teen bade adhikaar mil jaaenge, jiske liye ve kaaphi samay se maang karte aa rahe hai
 First right- LG will be bound to follow the advice so far Arvind Kejriwal cannot take any decision himself
 unhen apane har faisle ke baad uske liye uparajyapal kii manjuuri leni hoti he
 If the Supreme Court today gave a verdict in his favor, Kejriwal himself would be able to take a decision
 up rajyapal ke paas unhen file bhejne kii jarurat nahin hogi
 Actually, Article 239A of the Constitution provides for the assembly, Chief Minister and Lieutenant Governor in Union Territory of Delhi
 isi artical main 239AA (4) ke tahat vyavastha di gai he ki uparajyapal mukhyamantri kii salaah par kaam karenge
 But nowhere in the Constitution is it explained whether the Lt
 Governor is bound to uphold the cm's decision
 puraa pench yaheen fansaa he
 In contrast, governors in other states are bound to follow the decisions of the CM
 doosraa adhikaar- transfar-posting kar sakenge kejarivalmaujuuda vakt main arvind kejariwal dilli main kisi bhi karmchaaree kii transfar-posting nahin kar sakate
 The central government asserts its decision to transfer employees to Delhi
 kejariwal iskaa shuru se virodh kar rahe hai
 Kejriwal has been saying that no one listens to the elected government in Delhi
 unka kahana he ki dilli ke adhikari se lekar karmchaaree tak unki baat nahin maanate
 Due to this, he also staged a 9-day sit-in at LG House
 agar aaj supreme court kaa faisla kejariwal ke haq main aata he to dilli ke adhikariyon-karmchaariyon kii transfar-posting kaa adhikaar bhi kejariwal ko mil jayega
 Third Right- The ACB will come under the Delhi government, the Aam Aadmi Party came into existence only because of the fight against corruption
 arvind kejariwal ne dilli main sarkaar banane ke baad sabase jor-shor se jo kaam kiya, usamen bhrashtachar ke khilaaf ladaai rahi he
 Kejriwal formed the Anti Corruption Branch immediately after forming the government
 branch ne tabadatod kai chaape bhi maare
 But here again the Lt
 Governor intervened
 tatkaaleen uparajyapal najeeb jang ne june 2015 main ACB main apni pasand kaa adhikari baitha diya, jiskaa kejariwal sarkaar ne jamkar virodh kiya
 It was from here that the 'lieutenant Governor' and the Chief Minister got 'cold'
 is ghatana ke baad se kejariwal uparajyapal ke virodh main or mukhar ho gaye
 If today the Supreme Court verdict comes in favor of Kejriwal, then in the ACB, Kejriwal will again be able to appoint the officer of his choice and the anti-corruption campaign will be intensified

 vitt varsh 2020 main mudies ko bharat kii aarthik vikaas dar 4
 It is estimated to be 9 percent, compared to the first 5

 The main reason for this decline has been attributed to falling consumption by Indians
 bharatiyon kii khapat, sakal gharelu utpaada yani jidipi main badi hissedari rakhti he
 Consumption accounted for 57% of GDP in FY 2018-19

 The government has taken several steps to support the economy
 yani maang bade iske liye kai prayaas pehle hi kiye ja chuke hai
 But why is it not taking the name of improving consumption even after this? For example, even cheaper loans could not fetch encouraging figures for the purchase of houses or cars during the festive season
 lone melon ke baad bhi bainkon kii credit growth nichle str par hi he
 Savings are constantly falling and there is no sign of increasing income from village to city
 rahi bachi kasar mandi ke is maahaul main badhati mahangaai ne puri kar di

 Read the news on MSME in detail in small industry big crisis

 The reason for the breakdown of consumption is probably hidden in this fear, which is forcing most people to refrain from any major purchase

 At this time the need is to create new jobs in the economy, to increase the income in the existing employment and to bring more money into the hands of the people in the village

 Amid political turmoil over Congress President Rahul Gandhi's gotra, the religious leaders of Kashmir Pandits and Pandit Omkar Nath Shastri, a scholar of Vedic scripture, say that what Rahul claimed about his gotra is correct
 ajtak se khaas baatcheet main pandit omkar nath shastri ne kaha ki aamtaur par vivaah ke baad ladki kaa gotra badal jaataa he
 Since former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi did not convert after marrying Feroze Gandhi, she remained a Kashmiri Brahmin
 unka dah sanskaar bhi vaidic reeti rivaaj se hua
 Therefore, the tribe of Indira's son Rajiv Gandhi and Sanjay Gandhi will remain the same as the mother's
 pandit omkar nath shastri ne kaha ki chunki firoz gandhi parsi the isliye unka koi apana gotra nahin tha, yadi indira apana dharm parivartan kar letin to unka gotra bhi samaapt ho jaataa, jaisaa nahin hua
 He said that former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi married Sonia Gandhi of Bhitli
 lekin rajeev ne bhi apana dharm parivartan nahin kiya
 So Rajiv got his mother's gotra, similarly Rajiv's got his son Rahul Gandhi
 isliye rahul gandhi kaa daawa sahi he ki ve kaul brahman hai or unka gotra dattatreya he
 Omkar Nath Shastri said that if the scriptures are studied properly, there are rules in which the gotra of the mother is given to the children
 aapako bataa den ki congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne chunaav prachaar ke dauraan pushkar ke brahma mandir main darshan ke dauraan apni jati kashmiri kaul brahman or dattatreya gotra bataaya tha
 In fact, during the election campaign, Rahul visited several temples
 isi dauraan bijepi ne sawaal uthaaya ki ve apana gotra bataaen
 Earlier, during the Somnath Darshan during the Gujarat elections, there was a controversy about Rahul Gandhi's religion
 jiske baad congress ne bakaayade press conference rahul gandhi ke janeu pahane photo jari kiye or unhen janeudhari brahman bataaya gaya
 Significantly, the first Prime Minister of the country, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru was a Kashmiri Brahmin, whose later lineage also mentions his daughter Indira Gandhi as a Kashmiri Pandit because she did not convert her religion after marrying a Parsi Feroze Gandhi

 barkhaa ne ajay maakan aurrahul gandhi par nishanasadhate hue kaha ki congress party mahila suraksha kaa mudda kaaphi joro shoron se uthaati he, lekin uski kathani or kerani main kaaphi antar he
 Barkha said that a year ago i had a bad name with me, which i had also complained to Sonia Gandhi
 lekin us par koi bhi karrwai nahin kii gai thi
 Barkha said - We had gone to meet and busy in the Rahul party, Thebarkha also talked about ticket distribution, he said that when it was the turn of giving tickets to women, they sidestepped the issue

 The dream sequence is filmed between Khilji and Rani Padmini

 True story! # padmavatia post shared by Ranveer Singh (@ranveersingh) on Sep 1, 2017 at 10:01 pm PDT apane namakan ke liye ghar se nikalne se pehle arvind kejariwal ke twit se hangaamaa ho gaya he
 The ruckus means that those who elect the electorate are starting to enjoy it
 kejariwal ne twit kar kiran bedi se kaha he ki main kiran bedi ko bahes ke liye chunauti detaa hum jise koi tatasth sanchalit kare or sabhi tivi channel dikhaayen
 If this happens, the wishes of those who dream of making India's election like America will be fulfilled
 har baar bahes kii baat hoti he or har baar baat hi rah jaati he
 Our parties mimicked the American election, just could not muster the courage to debate
 twitor par kiran bedi or kejariwal ke samarthakon ke bich bahes ke auchity ko lekar khub maar-kaat machi he
 People from both camps are daring each other
 koi kah rahaa he ki kiran bedi bahes ke liye taiyaar ho jaaengi to doosraa kah rahaa he ki maidan chhodkar bhaag jaaengi
 i also jumped into the debate that if both sides approve, i am ready to agree to it
 yah meri bhi tatasthta kaa imtihaan hoga ki main kitna barabari se donon pakshon ko baat kehane ke liye mauka detaa hum
 It will also be no less big risk
 jab donon ke samarthak ek ek baat ko taraazoo par taulate rahenge ki main uski taraf jhukaa yaa isaki taraf jhukaa
 Whatever it is, i was thrilled for a short time by putting myself at stake in this examination
 khayr, koun wo tatasth hoga iskaa faisla to arvind or kiran ko hi milakar karnaa chahie
 Should Arvind and Kiran be debated
 agar dilli jaise sakshar rajya main bahes nahin ho sakati to kahaan hogi
 When will it happen? donon ek alag gaiyr-raajnneetik prishthbhumi se aate hai
 Both have been critical of today's political system
 yah sahi he ki daanv arvind kaa he to kiran sweekaar karne main hichakengi, lekin raajnneeti main yah koi badi baat nahin he
 Kiran Bedi can also accept and beat Kejriwal
 agar bahes hogi to ham is raajnneeti ko nae sire se dekh sakenge
 Will be able to test the reasoning and intellectual capacity of the leadership
 yah loktantr ke liye ek romaanchak mauka hoga jise dilli waalon ko haath se nahin jane dena chahie
 When there can be a face-to-face in the assembly, why can't it happen first
 arvind kejariwal kaa yah purana nuskhaa he ki bahes ke liye aamane-saamne ho jaaiye
 He also challenged it in the last election
 loksabhaa main bhi narendra modi ko ek tarah se lalkaarte hi the magar bahes nahin hui
 Congress must have shuddered thinking only of Rahul and Narendra Modi
 lekin dilli main arvind or kiran is maamle main baraabar hai
 They have no need to fear each other
 mujhe lagata he ki kiran bedi ko maan janaa chahie
 He has told our correspondent Ketki Angre that i do not believe in debate, i keep showing it
 bahes vidhansabha ke bheetar hoti he
 He has also said that there are 500 channels on whom to debate and whom to choose
 lekin arvind ne to kah diya he ki koi tatasth kare or saare channel dikhaayen
 i do not think that channels should be empowered by this
 netaaon kii ek raily ko ek hi samay par channel dikhaate to hai hi
 Kumar Vishwas has also tweeted an old tweet from Kiran Bedi
 kiran bedi ne obama or ruumani kii bahes dekhte hue twit kiya tha or kaha tha ki bahes dekhne se mat chukiye
 Yet Kiran Bedi's assertion that the debate is only within the Vidhan Sabha is not correct
 loktantr main asli bahes janata ke bich hoti he
 People face to face, democracy does not become great only by backing each other
 aamane-saamne aakar uskaa or vistaar hota he
 Yet accepting the challenge of debate is also a major strategic decision
 kejariwal ne bhi kisi ranneeti ke tahat hi chunauti di hogi
 Today, the TV and social media space can be their name
 par yah sach he ki hamaare desh main chunaav tivi or twitor main dhalataa ja rahaa he
 Everything is happening for TV
 tivi ke liye hi dikhne vaala cheharaa laayaa jaataa he, nahin dikhne laayak cheharaa raajnneeti main pachaas saal lagaakar bhi raaton raat gaayab kar diya jaataa he
 In this sense, Kiran Bedi has no justification for refusing
 bahes kii chunauti sweekaar kar ve apane kaaryakartaaon main gahari paith bana sakengi
 This debate can reach them anywhere
 ho saktaa he ki kiran bedi sweekaar bhi kar len, lekin soshal media or logon main yah dilchaspee to bad hi gai he ki kya ve sweekaar karengi
 Will there be a debate between Arvind Kejriwal vs Kiran Bedi
 arvind kejarwal ne kiran bedi se twitor par block hataa lene kii guzarish kii he
 Kejriwal said that he was blocked by Kiran Bedi
 kiran bedi ne bhi hamaari samvaadatata aditi rajput se kaha he ki kejariwal ko unke arajak vyavhaar kii vajah se bahut pehle hi block kar diya tha
 All this will go on, but there is a thrill in seeking debate
 dekhte hai kya hota he
 what do you say? andhere main ek car khadi or uske shishe band hai
 The glass of the car is of black frame so nothing is visible inside, just the sound is heard
 aisi aawaaj jise sunakar saaf samaj aa rahaa he ki andar kisi kaa rape ho rahaa he
 You will be stunned to see the people passing by the car reacting as they hear this voice
 log car ke paas se ladki kii chikhen sunate hai or ise ansuna karte hue aage bad jate hai
 Many people do the same but there are some people who try to break the glass of the car to save the girl
 ladki ko bachaane kii koshish karne waalon main ek 78 saal kaa wochaman bhi shaamil hota he
 yesnomaybe has shown in a social experiment how people do not try to save a girl by raping her
 haalanki vahiin kuch aise bhi hero the jo ladki kii chikhen sunakar use bachaane kii thaan lete hai
 However there is no girl in the car but a pre-recorded audio tape
 chaunkaane vaali baat to ye he ki jo log ise ansuna karte hue aage badhate hai usamen 2 pulisavaale bhi shaamil hai
