 He was attacked late last night on the National Highway in Sibi area
 unhone bataaya ki hamale main 13 log maare gaye or kai anya ghayal hue
 Other police officials said that three of the dead belonged to the minority Hindu community, who have been identified as Kapil, Varshin and Poojamal
 bas ke chaalak ne sibi ke nikat sadak kinare sthit ek hotel ke baahar jaise hi bas ko khadaa kiya, motorcycle par savaar chaar hathiyaarband logon ne usapar hamalaa kar diya
 Officials of the Livis militia said the two attackers entered the bus and set the bus on fire after spraying petrol on the passengers
 mritkon or ghayalon ko sibi ke aspataal le jaaya gaya, jahaan adhikariyon ne kuch ghayalon kii haalat bahut najuk bataai he
 Sibi Police Commissioner Nasir Ahmed Nasir said, "the driver and assistant of the bus escaped from the spot, we are looking for them
" sena or police ke javaanon ne ilaake ko gher liya he or bas ko aag lagane vaale sandigdh aparaadhiyon kii khoj kii ja rahi he
 Police suspect that it may have been an ethnic attack as many non-local people were boarding the bus
 balooch pruthakatavaadi pichley kuch varsh se praant main sarkari or suraksha pratishthanon par hamale kar rahe hai or isse pehle bhi anya praanton se aakar baluchistan ke vibhinn bhaagon main based logon ko nishaanaa bana chuke hai

 Those who were left in the bus climbed the fire
 agar aap chhaton par chadhakar survey karnaa chaahate hai to aapako meerut ke gaanv kinanagar janaa chahie
 In this village, all castes hang flags of their respective parties on the roofs
 aap in jhandon ko ginakar bataa sakate hai ki bahujan samaaj party (basapa) ko kitne vot aaenge or bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) yaa samaajawaadee party (sapa) ko kitne
 The colorful flags waving on the roofs show that there is no wave in favor of any one party
 is gaanv main aabaadi ke hisaab se sabhi jatiyaan hai, magar bahulata ke hisaab se jatav samaaj pehle number par he
 The Jatavs here have six thousand votes
 jatav basapa ke samarthak maane jate hai or uttar pradesh main dalit birdari kaa 70 fisadi hissaa jatvon kaa hi he
 Jatavs have a locality as soon as they enter the village
 sabaki chhaton par basapa kaa nila jhanda laga hua he
 There is no flag of any other party in the neighborhood of Jatavs
 yaheen ke logon kaa kahana he ki ve sirf basapa ko vot karte hai, magar unhen is baat kaa dukh bhi he ki duusari party ke ummidavaar aupchaarikta nibhaane ke liye bhi vot maangane nahin aate
 i would have got a vote if i had come
 yah hamane bhi dekha
 There was a small gathering of SP candidates in that village, in Balmiki Basti
 ummidavaar kaa kafila chah hazaar ke vot vaale mohalle kii taraf rukaa bhi nahin
 He went straight to the Valmiki colony with only three and a half hundred votes
 jatav samaaj ke logon ne kaha ki bijepi ke ummidavaar bhi bina vot maange chale gaye
 Of course, the party has its own vote bank
 jisaki sankhya kam he or jisaki apni koi party nahin he, usee ko lekar sari partiyon main maaraa-maari he
 Well, when i left the Jatavs' locality and went towards the upper castes, only the BJP flags were waving on their roofs
 thakuron or brahmanon ke gharon par bijepi kaa jhanda
 It was clearly visible which caste is inclined towards BJP
 jaise hi ham vahaan se nikalakar musalamaanon ke mohalle main gaye, unki chhaton par sirf samaajawaadee party ke jhande laharaa rahe the
 That is, by counting these flags, you can tell which party belongs to which caste and how much vote in this village
 jati sambandh behatar to hue hai, magar raajnneetik sambandhon main abhi bhi badlaav nahin he
 The Thakurs, who have lost their lives on cricket, are not even proud that a Dalit in their village makes a cricket ball, and on the other hand the exploited Jatav society considers the Balmiki community to be less than themselves
 is chunaav main kisi dal ne jaat-paat ke khilaaf sangharsh nahin kiya
 The parties and leaders who talked also started to cast candidates according to caste and they compromised with the parties for caste votes

 Forty-two years ago, Padmanarayan Jha Viranchi, editor of the paper 'janata', and Aten Bihari Vajpayeeka, interviewed in Patna for the magazine 'mithila Mihir', a famous English newspaper Indian National Kedendra Pathakane (who later became the editor of the newspaper)
 wo saakshaatkaar un dinon bhi news agenciyon ke madhyam se kai jagah prakashit hua lekin maheene bhar ke bheetar hi desh main apatkaal kii ghoshnaa ho gai or uski vishesh charchaa nahin ho pai
 Whenever there was discussion later, no more than the support given by Vajpayee to the Maithili language in the VIII schedule
 vaajapeyi ke is saakshaatkaar main videshniti, kashmir samasya, nepal, desh kii andruni raajnneeti, bhartiya communiston kaa soviet conection, america, rus or china ityadi vishyon par unka spasht drushtikon saamne aata he
 The same policies are still being run by the Bharatiya Janata Party government at the Center and this consistency in policies is amazing! One thing that is important is that Vajpayee at the time of inauguration of Kosi Mahasetu included Maithili language in the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution Mahatili campaigners have not only contributed to it, but this interview also has a special contribution, on which Vajpayee made his intention in 1975 itself
 Particular had
 maithili ko samvidhan kii aathvin anusuchee main avilamb shaamil kiya janaa chahie: atal bihari vaajapeyi"maithili bhashaa ko samvidhan kii ashtum anusuchee main avilamb sthaan milanaa chahie," ye ukti he jansangh ke varchasvi netaa shri atal bihari vaajapeyi kii, jinhone mithila mihir ko die ek vishesh bhentvaarta main ye baat kahi
 The main purpose of our meeting with Vajpayeeji was to get acquainted with and inspired by him and his team's view of Maithili language
 maithili ke prasang main san 67 main samvid sarkaar ke samay jansangh dwaara urdu ke sthaan par maithili ko bihar kii dwitiya rajbhasha ke rup main samarthan dene kii baat uthte hi shri vaajapeyi hulus kar bol uthe- "to kya, hamaare dal ne urdu ko kaatane ke udyeshy se maithili kaa samarthan kiya tha?" kshan bhar ke viraam ke baad pun: ve bol uthe- "hamalogon ne maithili kaa samarthan uski kshamta, uski vishisht garima or mithilanchal kii pracheen samskruti ke aadhaar par kiya tha
 The support of Jana Sangh given to Maithili was not influenced by jealousy or indignation towards any other language
 "usee tarah sindhi bhashaa ko manyata ke prashn par unhone kaha- "nishchit rup se maithili, sindhi kii tulana main shreshth sahitya kii sangrakshika he or ye bhashaa ek vyapak kshetra main abhivyakti kaa madhyam he
 Whereas Sindhi has not been the authority of any particular region
 aap log is baat ko note kar lijie ki maithili ko avilamb samvidhan kii ashtham anusuchee main sthaan milanaa chahie
 This is our demand, this is the demand of our party
 "rashtriya netaa kaa sanidhntal bihari vaajapeyi sirf jansangh ke sarvocch netaa hi nahin balki jane-maane rashtriya netaa ke rup main khyaati arjeet kar chuke hai
 For this reason, his companionship has become unforgettable for us from 3:30 pm to 5pm on May 7
 sthaneey adhivaktaa vishnudev babu ke yahaan wo sirdard kii vajah se vishram kar rahe the or uske thik baad unako gandhi maidan main ek saarvajanik sabha main bhaashan dene bhi janaa tha
 But upon hearing Mithila Mihir's name, he immediately came out and welcomed us in a familiar style
 maithili ke prati unka prem kisi tarah se chipa hua nahin tha
 Taking the copy of Mithila Mihir in his hand, he immediately said- "wow! It is a wonderful magazine
 iske naam se to main pehle se parichit hum
 "then they began to reverse the inner page and try to read the title like - 'chief Minister Dr
 Mishra no special meeting-talk', 'sootal chi aa baiya hoit achi' and 'teen gota poetry' (mihir 27 April) 
 phir muskuraate hue bole-"mujhe maithili samajhane main dikkat ho rahi he vaise kuch-kuch samaj jaataa hum
 "on this when we said that Maithili is Maithili
 
 
 to ve tatkaal tahaakaa lagaakar bole- "main kahaan kah rahaa hum ki maithili, hindi he
 In fact, Maithili is Maithili
 "rashtriya prashn: asahmati ke svarajansangh ke sarvocch sutaradhar se jis athmiya vaataavaran main hamaari baatcheet ho rahi thi, wo rashtriya prashnon par unke drushtikon or vichaaron ko jaanane kaa ek vishisht avasar tha
 He answered all the questions, big and small, with a smooth smile and intimacy, and there were some questions in which he also raised questions
 ek prashn ke uttar main ki jansangh kaa ghoshit siddhant to prarambh se hi prayek tarah kii araajaktaa or rashtriya sampatti kii kshati ke virodh main khadaa hone kaa he, phir uskaa vartmaan aandolan ko samarthan dene kaa auchity kya he, shri vaajapeyi ne kaha-"aap thik kah rahe hai
 The Jana Sangh can never support any such movement which is prone to damage to national property or anarchy
 maine pichley saal aandolan ke prarambh main hi patna main isi tarah kii chetavanee di thi
 But on the justification of our party's support to this movement, you should consider whether the violence and chaos is leading to this movement or the government is promoting it to get the movement right? As far as the Bihar movement is concerned, the Jana Sangh is supporting it because of its peaceful character and national purpose
 "phir hamalogon ne jansangh ke netaa se desh kii aantarik samasyaon se sambandhit bhinn-bhinn tarah ke sawaal kiye
 Question: When there is no consensus on the question of contesting elections among the opposition parties, are you hoping that they will be able to unite on the question of running the government after the election? Answer: (laughter) How the government in the absence of unity! For the formation of the government, the ruling party must be defeated and for that first unity is needed
 siddhant rup se aapaki baat se main jaraa bhi asahmat nahin hum lekin jahaan tak congress kii paraajay or pratipakshi dalon kii ekta kaa prashn he, us sambandh main ye samaran rakhie ki raajnneetik dalon kii ekta or sangharsh kii utpatti, aitihaasik paristhitiyon ke kaaran hoti he
 Question: Can your party enter into an electoral agreement with the Communist Party of Marx in the upcoming election? Answer: There is no question of Jana Sangh election agreement with the Marxabadi Party
 prashn: agar socialist party or marxbaadi dal aadi kaa 'vampanthi janatantric morcha' phir se sakriy ho jaae to kya aisi sthiti main jansangh, socialist party se bhi samjhauta tod legaa?uttar:nahin
 Our electoral agreement with the Socialist Party can be in any situation
 vaise ham use suzav denge ki wo sipiem se dur hat jaae
 Q: What is your view on the huge increase in the number of political parties? Which parties can be justified in the present system? Answer: i will not say about the justification but it is so certain that the number of political parties should be reduced
 vartmaan aandolan kaa prabhaav raajnneetik dalon kii sankhya briddhi par nishchit rup se padegaa
 Question: Is there any similarity between the concept of independent democracy and the 'janata' candidate? Answer: The concept of 'janata' candidate actually shows an all-party consensus over the independent environment and the political greed of the political parties to the people's Ganges - Tries to immerse in Yamuna
 jabaki 'nirdaleey janatantr' kii avadharana ek raajnneetik darshan he jo samvidhan va loktantr ko hastkshep, dhamkee or dabaav se mukt rakhane ke liye shri jaiprakash narayan dwaara prastut kiya gaya he
 But to establish this independent democracy also requires a strong political party
 (ye kah vaajapeyi hans uthe, unka spasht taatpary tha ki is aandolan main jansangh hi ekmaatr wo raajnneetik dal he jo jaiprakashji ke nirdaleey janatantr kii sthapana kii kshamta rakhata he!)prashn: sattarudh dal par aaplogon kaa aarope he ki wo aloktantric aacharan kar rahaa he, jabaki pratipaksh ko apni baat kehane kii har tarah kii suvidha abhi bhi praapt he?uttar :loktantr main raajnneetik dalon ke sang jis tarah kaa sattarudh dal kaa aacharan hona chahie wo aaj kisi rup main nahin ho rahaa he
 Today there is a flood of political killings in the country, political prisoners are being shot in jail due to different pretexts
 pradarshan or juluus par ek sau chauwalis laga diya jaataa he
 Shri Jayaprakashji's speech on AIR is completely blacked out
 is tarah se sarkaar ke loktantr-virdohi aacharan kaa kitne pramaan ginaaun?prashn: congress ke vartmaan netritv ke prati aapkaa kya vishleshan he?uttar :congress kaa vartmaan netritv adhinayakawad ke raste par ja rahaa he
 Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru was most aware of Parliament, while Mrs Gandhi had a defiant attitude towards Parliament
 ve virdohi dalon ke prati atyadhik ashishnu hai
 At the same time, the present leadership is also in favor of the Communist Party and it tries to cover this fact with soviet-india friendship
 jabaki vastusthiti ye he ki soviet maitri or bhartiya communist party donon alag-alag bate hai
 The secret of his friendship with the communists was understandable at the time of the Partition of the Congress, but to this day the rationale of this alliance is not understood! Moreover, the present leadership is reflecting the activities of a political party which Number two is working on money and is facing internal and external character crisis
 dal ke bheetar sabake sab ek duusare ko chor kah rahe hai
 Question: Are you looking at the possibility of restructuring the Constituent Assembly after the victory of the 'janata candidates' in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections? Answer: The rationale behind any task has to be considered
 mere vichaar se gat chhbbees varshon main samvidhan ko lagu karne main kya-kya trutiyaa hui hai uski jaanch-padtaal honi chahie
 a commission on constitution must be formed keeping in mind the problems of decentralization of power, center-state relations, economic potential and source of the state, fundamental rights of citizens, etc
 us ayog kii anushansa ke baad hi samvidhan sabha ke punargathan kii maang uthaai ja sakati he
 Question: What is your opinion on the issue of recalling representatives from Lok Sabha and Legislative Assemblies? Answer: In principle i agree with this
 lekin is naagarik adhikaar kaa upyog kis sanstha ke madhyam se, kin paristhitiyon main or kin prakriyaaon ke antargat kiya jaae-ye gambhir vichaarneey vishay hai
 By the way, almost all the losers will start the signature campaign immediately after the voting and then it will be difficult for the winning person

 Is Mr
 Sheikh Abdullah again indicating a new role? Answer: Sheikh Abdullah has gained wide experience of life and the situation of struggle with power Switch to are
 aaj ve phir se mukhya rashtriya dhara ke saath hai jiskaa sattarudh dal or pratipaksh bhinn-bhinn do kinaaraa he
 They can stand on either side, depending on their view
 vaise unka haalia vaktavy unki nai bhoomika se zyada unke sudrudh charitra kaa parichay zyada detaa he
 Question: After the rise of Bangladesh, you had a secret meeting with Mr
 Sheikh Abdullah in Delhi
 uske baad se kya unke drushtikon main koi ullekhneey parivartan aayaa he?uttar :jis samay shaikh ke sang meri pehali vaarta hui thi us samay unka drushtikon pakistan ke saath shanti banaae rakhane or vivaad ke hal ke liye agar paak-adhikrut kashmir pakistan ko de bhi dena pade to is paksh main tha
 At the same time, he wanted that even though being an integral part of India, the door of Kashmir should be opened to Pakistani tourists
 shaikh kaa vichaar ye bhi tha ki srinagar-rawalpindi sadak maarg ko chaalu rakhaa janaa chahie kyonki barfbaari ke samay srinagar-jammu maarg avaruddh ho jaataa he or kashmir ko vyapaar main ghaataa uthaanaa padataa he
 Sometimes it becomes difficult to get salt even in Srinagar
 lekin jahaan tak abhi kaa prashn he, agar bharat sarkaar paak-adhikrut kashmir par kabja jamaane kii koshish kare to nishchay hi shaikh usamen madadgaar honge
 Along with the areas of consent, there are also some areas where Shri Vajpayee often looked like agreed from the present system and its perspective
 wo kshetra he bharat sarkaar kii videsh niti
 However, reacting sharply to the demonstration led by Congress MP Shasibhushan on the Chinese Embassy a few days ago, he said - "what does the leadership of the Congress MP Shasibhushan's protest at the Chinese Embassy mean? What could be the secret that so many After days, Congressmen have remembered the independence of Tibet? When I, Jayaprakashji, Dr
 Lohia and Kripalaniji have called Tibet If we raised the question, we were called reactionaries, then why today these "progressive" people have aroused sympathy for Tibet? Is the Indian government ready to join hands with China at the behest of Soviet Union? Is not doing? Question: Do you agree with the Nepal policy of the Government of India? Answer: There is nothing special about consent-disagreement
 mul baat ye he ki nepal ek bade desh kaa aisa padosi desh he jiske duusari taraf bhi ek vishaal raashtra maujuud he
 It is natural for Nepal to become suspicious and clever in such a situation
 lekin itnaa nishchit he ki nepal or bharat kii janata kisi bhi sthiti main in donon deshon ko ek duusare ke vipareet nahin jane degi
 Question: America still considers itself the defender of democracy in the world
 is sambandh main aapkaa kya vichaar he?uttar :america ke bheetar main loktantr avashya he lekin baahar main adhinayakawad he
 i am a strong opponent of US military base and colonial policy in the name of democracy
 prashn: soviet sangh kii videshniti ke prati aapkaa kya vishleshan he?uttar :main soviet sangh se mitrataa or sakriy sahyog kaa prashansak hum
 But now, with the rise of China and America into a global power, apart from the us-russia, there is a gradual change in the policy of the Soviet Union and they are making new preparations to divide the whole world under their influence with the US respectively
 madhya-purv asia or bharat ke sambandh main is tarah kii prachhann sahmati vaali niti kaa ek tarah se janm ho chukaa he
 The result will be that developing countries will also determine their new roles
 prashn: vietnam yuddh kii samaapti par aapaki kya pratikriya he? kya donon vietnam kaa ekikaran tatkaal sambhav he?uttar :vietnam yuddh main rashtravaadi tatwon kii vijay hui he
 However, it is certain that the communist element had an important contribution in this national struggle
 phir bhi vietnam ke logon ne kisi videshi sena ko apni dharti par sahaytarth utarane kaa aamantran nahin diya
 As far as integration is concerned, no predictions can be made in that regard
 vaise main chaahunga ki agar chunaav ke madhyam se sarkaar kaa gathan ho to vietnam kii adhikansh aantarik samasyaon ko sulajhane main madad milegi
 In motion it was natural to ask Kavashree Vajpayee, who had been a poet at the beginning of his life, why he has stopped writing poetry now
 is prashn ke uttar main vaajapeyiji ne kaha- "haa, pehle main kavita likhata tha, lekin ab maine chhod diya he
 Now i have poetry in my pace! "after a few moments of silence, he again said -" There is a big opposition in active politics and poetry
 kavita ke liye samay or ekaagratha chahie jo mujhe mil nahin paata he
 "to this, our friend and influential Maithili litterateur Mr
 Markandeya Pravasi immediately asked-" If the poet-gan surrounds you? " nai kavita ke sambandh main shri vaajapeyi kaa kahana tha- "nai kavita main padhata hum or wo mujhe pasand he
 The new poem gives a glimpse of the problem of the era and more than that its catastrophe
 "vaajapeyiji avivaahit hai, so is sambandh main kisi kii jigyaasa swabhaavik he
 When we asked him whether the situation of being free from family obligations for service to the country was more ideal, Vajpayee got a little serious and said - "being free from family obligations for country service can be a convenient situation, because it will work
 There is more time to do and one usually gets the opportunity to stay away from selfishness
 lekin hamase(arthath avivaahit netaaon se) shreshth ve log hai jo paariwarik daayitv kaa vahan karte hue bhi desh or dal kii seva karte hai
 "while walking towards the end, Mr
 Vajpayee could not live without saying this in his poise and humor - a mixed kindred voice" - See God! i will not put salt and pepper in my comments, i will give the impression as i have said
 " ye kah ve pun: mukt kanth hans pade

 The corruption of the bjp-led MCD has upset the people of Delhi the most
 koi kaam bina rishwat ke nahin puraa hota
 Apart from this, the party he joined, is also no Ganga of honesty

 Somewhere Bedi's condition should not be the same
 main ajay maakan ko vot duungaa, kyonki

 aisa hota dikhataa nahin he
 The way the BJP shed money like water in the Lok Sabha elections, will the same happen in these elections

 Why is Arvind Kejriwal challenging the debate and Ajay Maken of the Congress agrees, but Kiran Bedi has reservations

 ek mudde par unki party kahaan khadi he, yah to saarvajanik ho or aisa dibet ke jariye bhi sambhav he, par bedi ji ko isse parhez he
 The shocking thing is that Kiran Bedi repeatedly insists on dialogue

 How will Delhi earn money? i am most disappointed by the fact that till now all the leaders of Delhi have talked about sharing freebies, but how will Delhi earn? Nobody said anything on this

 Delhi's security accountability Who will be responsible for Delhi's security? After the December 16 accident, every Delhiite struggled with the same question as to who should be held accountable for this major lapse

 Why does your heart change again and again: First agitate against corruption, then avoid politics and then suddenly agree to enter politics

 Where is the Leader of Opposition in Bihar Legislative Assembly Tejashwi Yadav is becoming a mystery
 iske saath hi ek bada sawaal yah bhi khadaa ho rahaa he ki kya tejasvi patna main nahin rahanaa chaahate hai
 Senior Rashtriya Janata Dal leaders like Raghuvansh Prasad Singh and Shivanand Tiwari have expressed concern over Tejashwi staying outside Patna, let us tell you that Tejashwi has been out of Patna for almost a month
 vah is bich apane ghar par iftaar ho yaa mujaffarpur main bacchon kii maut sabase khud ko dur rakhaa he
 If RJD sources are to be believed, the party's national president Lalu Yadav has called and advised them to go back to Patna
 lekin abhi tak iskaa koi asar hota nahin dikhaai de rahaa he
 Party mlas are seen in the most tension
 unka kahana he ki loksabhaa chunaav ke parinaam ke aane ke baad tejasvi ke rukh kii vajah se party jitna hataash or niraash he utana to 2010 ke vidhansabha chunaav haarane ke baad bhi nahin hui thi
 Senior party leaders also believe that if the same situation prevails, in the coming time, mlas will start the process of joining Janata Dal United (JDU) or BJP according to the equation of their constituency, but before that Tejashwi Yadav's style of functioning i will not raise my finger vahiin party ke kuch lalu yadav ke vishwast karibiyon kaa kahana he ki tejasvi kaa jo abhi tak kaa vyavhaar rahaa he wo nishchit rup se samaj se pare he
 But perhaps after winning one Lok Sabha and two Vidhan Sabha by-elections, he may have misunderstood that he has enough votes that he does not need anyone to fulfill his dream of becoming Chief Minister
 lekin sachai yahi he ki adhikansh vidhayak maanate hai ki argedy ke tikat par or tejasvi yadav ke netritv main koi unhen chunaav nahin jita saktaa he
 But once again, if Nitish Kumar is with him, no one can beat him
 tejasvi yadav ke ravaie se sahyogi dal bhi kafa hai
 Like a Congress party leader or Jeetan Ram Manjhi or Mukesh Nishad
 sab saarvajanik or nijee baatcheet main ab unhen mukhyamantri pad kaa ummidavaar maananaa to dur unke saath bhavishya kii raajnneeti karne par punarvichaar kar rahe hai

 Delhi Police has started the investigation by capturing the body and the body has been sent for post-mortem at AIIMS
 shuruaati jaanch main police aatmahatya kii baat ko sweekaar nahin rahi he or yah bhi kah rahi he ki swaabhaavik maut bhi ho sakati he
 Significantly, yesterday, due to a dispute on Twitter, Shashi Tharoor and Sunanda Pushkar were named in the news
 shashi tharur ne fasebuk pej par dikhe saajha bayaan main kaha tha ki, ''hamaare twitor khaaton se kuch anadhikrut tawits ke kaaran upje ashobhaneey vivaad se ham vyathit hai
 
 
 The controversy began when intimate messages allegedly sent by a Pakistani woman journalist were posted on Tharoor's Twitter account
 ullekhneey he ki twitor par shashi tharur ke folbers badi sankhya main hai
 Shashi Tharoor's wife Sunanda then claimed on the microblogging site that she had allegedly posted intimate messages sent by Lahore journalist Meher Tarar to Tharoor to show the world how 'she Lies behind my husband
 
 
 ' Let me tell you that at around eight o'clock tonight Shashi Tharoor had tweeted that he will not go to Jaipur because his wife is ill and he will stay with his wife in such a situation

 Pakistani journalist Meher Tarar, after hearing the news, expressed grief in her reaction to this
 aam aadmi party ke mukhiya arvind kejariwal ko unki party main ek or bada jhatka laga he
 Party's senior leader Shanti Bhushan attacked Kejriwal and said till date that there is no internal democracy in the party
 shajia ilmi ke party chhodane ke baad aam aadmi party ke andar kii kalah kaa yah doosraa sabase bada maamla saamne aayaa he
 Shanti Bhushan said in an exclusive conversation till date, 'it was a childish decision by Kejriwal to resign from the Delhi government
 is faisle se aam aadmi party ko kaaphi nuksaan hua
 The party does not have internal democracy
 party ke kisi bhi netaa ke paas sanghathan ko aage le jane kii samaj nahin he jiskaa khamiyaja party ko bhugatna pad rahaa he
 Making serious allegations against Kejriwal, he said, 'kejriwal does not take suggestions from others
 unhen party kii jimmedaari kisi or ko saunp deni chahie
 'significantly, earlier Yogendra Yadav also questioned Kejriwal's leadership ability
 ab jab party ke sansthaapak sadsy shanti bhushan ne kejariwal par hamalaa bolaa to virdohi kaise peeche rahete

 Vinod Kumar Binny, MLA from Laxmi Nagar, an old ally of Kejriwal, said, "if experienced and senior like Shanti Bhushan are saying this, then the matter is serious
 'bijepi or vinod kumaar binni ke siyaasi waar ke baad congress ne bhi kejariwal par tikhe hamale kiye
 When party leader Mukesh Sharma called Kejriwal greedy, Delhi Congress state president Arvinder Singh Lovely called him a liar
 arvinder singh lavali ne kaha, 'kejariwal ek number ke jhuthe hai
 His name must be recorded in the Guinness Book for lying
 'dilli congress ke varisht netaa haaron yusuf ne kaha, 'kejariwal kii party jhuthe vaadon ke dam par satta main ai
 Now many people believe that he did not believe Kejriwal
 shanti bhushan ke bayaan se saaf ho gaya ki unki party kii sthiti kya he
 ' jab hamane esadm mehta se poocha ki sharaab koi zaruri saamagree nahin he or logon kaa virodh hone ke baad bhi use kyon kholaa ja rahaa he to esadm ne kaha, "ye logon kaa nahin balki kuch logon kaa hi virodh he
 The liquor shop was legally allotted and when there was a protest in one place, we marked it for another place
 lekin kuch log apane swaarth ke liye virodh kar rahe hai
 Everyone has the freedom of catering and liquor shops are opening under a government policy and if the shop is not open then people can drink poisonous liquor

 ' After breaking a 25-year-old alliance with the BJP, the Shiv Sena has now started targeting this party
 shivasena ne kaha ki uske netaa bal thakare the jo hindutv ke liye khadey hue jabaki dusron ne iskaa raajnneetik phaayde ke liye istemaal kiya
 The party has warned that those who came with a desire to win Maharashtra were buried in the state land
 party ne bijepi ko centre kii satta main laane kaa shrey divangat bal thakare ke prayaason ko diya
 The editorial of the Sena mouthpiece Saamana states, 'the fight (assembly election on October 15) is of self-respect
 ’ mukhpatr ne kaha he, ‘chaahe aurangzeb ho yaa afjal khan, jo bhi nihit swaarth ke saath aae yaa to dafan ho gaye yaa nasht ho gaye

 shivaji ne hindvi swarajya banaaya, lekin ye shivasena ke divangat pramukh the jinaki desh main hindutv pataakaa fahraane kii patibaddhta thi
 The party has expressed surprise at the leaders with the "knife next to Ram in the mouth" stance
 sampadakeey main kaha gaya he ki maharashtra or desh main hindutv kaa prachaar sunishchit karne ke liye divangat thakare ko kai hamalon kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 As happened in Aurangzeb's case, the new Aurangzeb will be defeated

 google kii suraksha ko thenga dikhaate hue whatsapp kaa farji ap play store par uplabdh rahaa or ise 10 lakh logon ne downlod bhi kiya he
 According to reports, an app named Update whatsapp on Google Play Store remained for a long time, which people continued to download
 sabase khatarnaak or gambhir ye he ki yah ap usee develpar naan se tha jisase asli whatsap ap google play store par he
 Therefore, the downloading users were also considering it as Assi
 ek redit yujar ne isse pehle dhundha uske mutabik whatsap ke is ap ne un logon kaa nuksaan kiya he jinhone ise apane mobile main install kiya he
 It is worth noting that whatsapp Inc is available from the developer name on the whatsapp App Play Store
 aam taur par farji ap kii pahchaan karne ke liye log develpar kaa naam padhate hai taaki yah pataa laga saken ki ap koun se publisher kaa he or jis develpar kaa he wo sahi he yaa nahin
 whatsapp's fake app was only available on the Google Play store with the whatsapp Inc developer name
 aise main logon ke liye ise sahiya galat samajhane kaa koi doosraa opshan nahin tha or shaayad isi vajah se ise 10 lakh logon ne downlod bhi kar liya

 com / dmvtksqpup— Nikolaos Chrysaidos (@virqdroid)november 3, 2017aapako bataa den ki yah pehla mauka nahin he jab android ko farji ap ke jariye torget kiya gaya he
 Even before this, many such dangerous and fake apps come on the Google Play Store, which also causes big loss to the user
 yah kaise sambhav he ki koi whatsapp Inc develpar nem se koi ap google play store par rakh saktaa he?yah sawaal aapke man main bhi hoga
 Looking at it, it seems as if hackers have used any matrix to display whatsapp Inc instead of the developer name
 ye tricks unicode ho saktaa he
 This has also been seen earlier when people were fooled by opening Apple's website through a Unicode
 kyonki aipal kaa domen apple
 com and Unicode tricks were done such that apple in the browser
 com hi dikhaa
 The Reddit user has also shared a screenshot of the details of this app, which reads whatsapp + Inc% C3% A0, but only whatsapp Inc is shown on the Play Store and the other codes are invisible
 chunki whatsap ko duniya bhar main ek arab log yuj karte hai aise main is naam kaa farji ap kaaphi gambhir he
 Therefore, it can be called Google's security lapse
 google ne haal hi main google play protect kii shuruyaat kii he jo google play store par vaise eps kii pahchaan karegaa jo farji hai
 Not only this, the company has been claiming that millions of apps are scanned continuously so that no dangerous apps can come in the Google Play Store
 lekin phir bhi koi ap bilkul whatsap jaise hi develpar nem se uplabdh rahaa or logon ne ise downlod kiya yah kaaphi gambhir maamla he or google ko is par dhyaan dena chahie
 Because by installing fake whatsapp, problems can arise from sensitive data theft from your smartphone to phone hacking

" ' Congress leader Manish Tiwari on Wednesday taunted the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) for putting forward the name of Vinayak Damodar Savarkar for Bharat Ratna in the BJP manifesto for the Maharashtra Assembly Election
 unhone kaha he ki party ko sidhe nathuram godse (nathuram Godse) ko bharat ratna se sammanit karnaa chahie
 Talking to the media in Nagpur, Tiwari said, 'savarkar was accused only of plotting to assassinate Mahatma Gandhi, while Nathuram Godse had carried out the murder
 is varsh ham mahatma gandhi kii 150 veen jayanti manaa rahe hai, is avasar par endie sarkaar ko saavarkar kii jagah sidhe godse ko bharat ratna se sammanit karnaa chahie'maharashtra main 21 oktober ko hone ja rahe vidhansabha chunaav ke liye mangalvaar ko apana ghoshnaptr jari karte hue maharashtra bhaajapa ne hindutv ke pairokaar saavarkar or 19veen sadi ke samaaj sudhaarak jyetiba phule tathaa unki patni savitribai phule ko bharat ratna die jane kii maang uthaai thi
 Why does NDA / BJP government want to confer Bharath Ratna on Savarkar why not Godse? Former was only chargesheeted & later acquitted for assassination of Gandhi while latter was convicted & hanged
 On his 150 th Anniv if you want to defile his memory then go the whole nine yards?isse pehle buudhvaar ko congress netaa raashid alvi ne bhi sawarkaar ko bharat ratna se sammanit karne kaa zikr karne par bhaajapa par nishaanaa saadhaa tha
 He had said that now the next name could be Nathuram Godse
 alvi ne kaha tha, 'saavarkar ke itihaas ko har koi jaanata he
 Savarkar was accused of killing Gandhi, he was released due to lack of evidence
 aaj, yah sarkaar kah rahi he ki ve saavarkar ko bharat ratna denge, mujhe dar he ki agali pankti main godse ho ho sakate hai
 Justifying the demand for the award of Bharat Ratna to Vinayak Damodar Savarkar in the election manifesto, Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Wednesday attacked the Congress and said that it was opposed to giving the highest civilian honor to such 'nationalists' Has been prasad ne ek samvaadadaata sammelan ko sambodhit karte hue yah bhi aarope lagaaya ki congress yah sunishchit kar rahi he ki keval ‘‘parivaar ke sadasyon'' ko hi sarvocch naagarik sammaan mili
 Prasad alleged that the Congress had not given Bharat Ratna to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the country's first Home Minister, and Dalit Adarsh babasaheb Ambedkar
 unhone kaha, ‘in donon netaaon ko (maranoparant) tab sarvocch naagarik sammaan diya gaya jab narsingh raav desh ke pradhanmantri the, jo parivaar se taalluk nahin rakhte the
 'prasad asked,' Why is the Congress upset because the BJP raised the demand for Bharat Ratna to Savarkar in its manifesto? The Congress always used to collect 'bharat Ratna' in the family

 praayogic rup se mumbai or guwahati rajdhani train main yah pranali lagaai jaaegi
 The integrated circuit (IC) chip developed at ISRO will be installed in the engines of railway trains

 The comments is pranali se musafiron or anya logon ko bahut madad milegi kyonki abhi train kii sthiti or awajahi kaa pataa lagane ke liye aisi vyavastha nahin he

 adaalat kii avmaananaa kar logon kii nigahon main aayaa sant rampal jab tak giraftaar nahin hua tha, tab tak logon ko ye gumaan bhi nahin tha ki is shaks ke peeche rahasyon or karatuuton kii fehrist itani lambii hogi
 But now as soon as Rampal comes under the clutches, his tilism is starting to happen again and again, one by one his secrets are also exposed
 raaj bhi aise ki jo bhi sune, bas sunata rah jaae
 The police have found many things from Rampal's ashram, about which people had little idea before
 police ne rampal ke kamare se pregnancy test kit bhi baraamad kii he
 The hypocrisy of religion is now melting behind bars
 kabirpanth ke is dhvajdhari ke liye swayambhu sant bananaa baari pad gaya
 Holding bars with hands, Baba is turning every page of his past
 gunahon ke dhan se daulat kaa ambara lagane vaale baba kaa ghamand jalte hue lohe kii tarah pighalane laga he
 Now such revelations are being made by Rampal that ears are being raised only after listening
 police ab rampal ko saath lekar, ashram ke kone koneki sachai baahar laana chaahati he
 And for this, six different police teams were formed
 aaj ham baba kaa wo khulaasa karne ja rahe hai jisamen baba ke 10 behad gahare raaj chupe hai
 1
 ladies bathroom par baba kii nazar!vaise to baba ke ashram main andar baahar, anginat sisitivi camere lage hai
 But Raj's point is that Baba had installed CTV cameras on the female toilets too
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki in sisitivi kii screen rampal ke behad khaas rest room se lekar unjagahon par lagi thim, jahaan baba ke sivaa kisi ko jane kii ijaajat nahin thi
 By the way, 854 bathrooms, 1254 toilets have been built in Baba's ashram
 lekin sutron ke mutabik baba ke camere mahila bathroom ko zyada ghoorte the
 The police are constantly investigating it and exposing Baba
 2
 The bath of milk and the offering of Kheer! The second secret that has come to light after the arrest of Baba Rampal is that Baba used to take bath with milk, and then used to distribute the same milk pudding to the devotees
 rampal oonche se asana par dhyaan kii mudra main baith jaataa tha, bhakt baba ko nahalaate or phir usee doodh ko bartan main ikattha kiya jaataa
 Firbaaba makes this milk pudding and distributes it among the devotees
 bataaya jaataa he ki kamare kii chat par lage pipe se rampal par doodh giraaya jaataa tha
 Then the same milk was collected in tub etc
 baba ke badan se utre doodh kii kheer banavaai jaati
 Baba used to say that whoever eats this kheer will have miracles
 baba rampal aisa satalok ashram main hi nahin karata tha, balki rohtak ke ashram main bhi wo doodh se hi nahaata tha
 In the old ashram built on 4 acres, Baba kept 20 cows and Baba used to bathe with the milk of those cows
 3
 Baba's bedroom of Ayyashi! Baba's secret folk built on 12 acres of land and Baba's 5 storey fort in that mystery
 is kile main baba kaa lagzri bedroom jisamen maujuud thim, five star hotel jaisi suvidhaayen
 But the pleasure of the bedroom mattress is gone
 baba ke bedroom main bana bathroom bhi ekadam videshi he
 Baba used to order his black commands from this bedroom, then the secret lift also opens in Baba's bedroom
 baba ke bedroom main ayyasha kaa puraa saamaan maujuud tha
 4
 baba kaa bulatopruf singhasanarampal 12 foot oonche bullate pruf singhaasana par baithta tha
 Rampal used to preach to the devotees by sitting on this throne-like chair
 baba ke is bulatopruf cabin kii ek or khaasiyat haivo ye ki isamen hydrolic lift lagi he jiske jariye baba diarect cabin main pahunchaa tha
 There are cameras all around
 yani baba pravachan ke saath saathsb par najar bhi rakhata tha
 5
 rampal ke tahkhaane kaa rajbat chaahe rampal ke karauntha ashram kii ho yaa phir barwaala ke satalok ashram kii police kii maane to uske ashramon main gupt tahkhaana jarur hota he
 Where Rampal hides from the eyes of the world, carrying out mysterious activities
 rampal ke tahkhaanon kaa raaj 2006 main tab pehali baar saamne aayaa, jab uske is ashram main uske bhakton ke saath aryasamaj ke anuyaayiyon kii jhadap hui
 When the police entered Rampal's ashram, his eyes got torn as he saw the basement hidden in the ashram along with all the comforts
 police kii maane to ashram main maujuud is tahkhaane ko kuch is tarah se banaaya gaya tha ki ye tamaam logon kii nigahon se hameshaa ojhal bana rahaa
 From this basement about 100 meters long, Rampal used to appear among the devotees many times that people considered him elusive
 lekin jab police ne ashram kaa chappa-chappa khangala to ye raaj saamne aa gaya
 Hisar Police has also received reports of Rampal's cellar at Barwala Ashram
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki in tamaam raaj se pardaa hataane ke liye soobe ke dijipi ashram ko khangaalane main kam se kam do dinon kaa vakt lagane kii baat kah rahe hai
 6
 nastredamas kaa 'avatar'rampal kii har shigufebaaji or har raaj chaunkaanewaala he
 Would you believe that Rampal declares himself to be a Hindu saint appearing after 445 years, mentioned in 1555 by the famous prophet Nostredamus
 darasal, nastredamas ne apni bhavishyavaanee ke dauraan ye kaha tha ki aaj se koi 445 saal baad ek aisa hindu sant prakat hoga, jo puri duniya main bharat ko vishwa guru ke taur par sthapit karegaa or saal 2006 se urj main aae rampal ne khud ko vahi sant bataa kar logon kii ankhon main dhul jhonknaa shuru kar diya
 These things were mentioned in many books of Rampal's ashrams
 in saahitiyon kii maane to nastredamas kii bhavishyavaanee ke mutabik paanchaven shatak ke ant tak yani saal 1999 main ek sant ghar sansar chhodkar sant banegaa or uski kranti 2006 tak chalegi
 After this, people will follow him and then the golden age will begin
 7
 Devotees, Baba and Maya, by spreading the net of marketing level marketing, you must have seen many companies completing the journey from floor to hail
 police kii maane to rampal ne apane aadambar kaa jaal batta failaane ke liye kuch aisa hi hatkandaa apana rakhaa tha
 He used to ask each of his devotees to join two devotees and brainwash them by stopping them in the ashram in the name of giving initiation
 rampal ke is emlm kaa jaal kitna kargar sabit hua iskaa andaja isi se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki khud ko parameshwar bataakar moksh kaa rasta dikhaane kaa daawa karanevaale rampal ke in baton par yakeen kar hajaaron log rampal par karodon rupye lutaa chuke the
 8 When Rampal's chest was pulled from Rajbarwala's bill, when the Haryana Police entered the Satlok Ashram, another secret of Rampal was waiting for him
 raaj rampal kii tijori kaa
 
 
 In fact, in this ashram, Rampal not only kept closed shelves and dryers in many locks, but also electronic safes were present at certain locations
 wo tijoriyaan jise aam taur par nakadi or jewelri jaisi beshkeemtee chijen rakhane ke liye istemaal kii jaati hai
 But on the go, Rampal and his supporters not only locked these chestnuts with secret code numbers, but also removed a few batteries to make the police work difficult
 sawaal ye uthta he ki khud ko fakiri ke sant kabir ke nakshe kadam par chalanevaala bataane vaale rampal ne aakhir itani daulat kahaan se or kaise jodi
 Which he had to keep in captivity in the vault
 aise main ab in tijoriyon ko khol kar iske andar chhipe asli raaj tak pahunchnaa police ke liye ek or chunauti he
 9 Every day, the police, who are tearing down the layers of hard diskrampal's handiwork of Baba's deeds, are getting new things
 police ne rampal ke kareebi balajit or uski beti babita ke kabze se jo kuch baraamad kiya he, unhen dekh kar uski nigahen tedi ho gai hai
 
 
 In fact, the police has found a laptop, 6 mobile phones, 10 hard disks, 17 cds, 3 telephone diaries and five files from Babita
 police ko shaq he ki in tamaam chizon main baba ke kai gupt raaj dafn ho sakate hai
 
 
 Then whether it is for the business of Raaz Aandbar or any other business, this is the reason that while the police are searching the corner of this ashram with a search warrant, on the one hand, they are also roaming around with a team of some cyber experts
 So that the secret hidden in these electronic devices can be extracted
 
 
 ashram ke aas-paas kheton main mili aapattijanak or ashleel saamagree kaa milanaa bhi philhal jaanch ke daayre se baahar nahin he
 10
 hawalat main rampal kii pehali ratkaidakhane kii zamin par baba kii qamar akad gai hogi
 Rampal did not sleep even a second on the first night in the lockup
 karvaton main raat guzar gai
 Baba did not even taste morsel in the cell
 bas ek bottle pani maanga
 Rampal, standing behind bars, must have thought his smile in these pictures
 paanch din kii police remand main hawalat kii hawa kha rahe baba ko court main pesh kiya gaya to 80 minute tak gardan nahin uthi

 supreme court dwaara adaalat kii avmaananaa kaa notice milane ke baad kolkata hoicourt ke justise sies karnan ne sarvocch nyaayalay ke kisi sitting jaj ko notice thamane ke adhikaar par hi sawaal khadaa kar diya he
 Also, he has once again alleged that upper caste judges are illegally using their rights to get rid of a Dalit judge
 aage badhane se pehle bataa den ki justise karnan vahi hai jo 2011 se purv or maujuuda jajon par aarope lagaate aa rahe hai ki unke (karnan ke) dalit hone kii vajah se unhen duusare jajon dwaara pratadit kiya jaataa rahaa he
 In 2016, Justice Karnan said on the Supreme Court Collegium's transfer to his Kolkata High Court that he was sad that he was born in India and wanted to go to a country where there is no casteism
 supreme court ke sabar kii seemaa tab paar ho gai jab isi saal janvari main karnan ne pradhanmantri ko chitthee likhakar supreme court or madras hycourt (jahaan vah pehle padasth the) ke jajon par bhrashtachar ke aarope lagaae
 Along with this, he also wrote the names of 20 judges present and retired in his letter
 iske baad supreme court ne 8 farvari ko justise karnan ko notice jari kiya or poocha ki kyon na ise court kii avmaananaa mana jaae
 Significantly, Karnan is the first sitting judge of the High Court to receive such notice
 tippaniyan Now Karnan has said in response to this notice that the Supreme Court has the right to send notice to the current judge of the High Court
 karnan ne kaha ki supreme court chaahe to unke khilaaf avmaananaa kaa maamla sansad main sarka saktaa he
 The English newspaper Hindustan Times has claimed that a copy of the letter written by Karnan in response to the Supreme Court notice is available with them
 akhbaar ke mutabik karnan ne likhaa he ki 'yah aadesh kisi tark kaa paalan nahin karata isliye iskaa kriyanvayan ke lihaaz se thik nahin he
 The characteristics of this order clearly show how the law is in the hands of the upper caste judges and they are using their judicial forces to get rid of the SC / ST judges

 sabase zyada charchaa main vah tab aae jab unhone 2011 main anusuchit jati rashtriya ayog ko chitthee likhi ki unke dalit hone kii vajah se vah anya jajon dwaara utpeedit kiye jate hai
 He also alleged that other judges are bent on proving him to be small
 udhaaharan dete hue unhone kaha tha ki kis tarah ek shaadi ke kaarykram main ek duusare jaj ne apane pairon ko yah sochakar thodaa dur kar liya ki kahin karnan kaa pair unase chhu na jaae
 One of the three judges of the High Court Collegium, who recommended Karnan's appointment as a judge, publicly apologized last year for appointing Karnan

 Karnan said that the Supreme Court can move a contempt case against him in Parliament if he wants
 angreji akhbaar hindustan times ne daawa kiya he ki supreme court ke notice ke jawaab main karnan dwaara likhi gai chitthee kii copy unke paas uplabdh he
 According to the newspaper, Karnan has written that 'this order does not follow any logic, so it is not good in terms of implementation
 is aadesh ke lakshan safataur par dikhaate hai ki kis tarah kanoon oonchi jati ke jajon ke haath main he or vah apni nyaayik takaton ko anusuchit jati / janajati ke jaj se chhutkaaraa paane ke liye iskaa beja istemaal kar rahe hai
 Hence the self-induced contempt order issued on 8 February 2017 cannot survive under the law

 The 76-meter-wide Kosi bridge has now connected the two halves of Greater Mithila
 inhen kosi nadi kii prabal dhara ne ek-duusare se juda kar rakhaa tha
 The British-era bridge over this river fell in the 1934 earthquake
 so donon padosi jilon (madhubani or supaul) ke logon ko ek-duusare ke jile main pahunchane ke liye nepal se hokar janaa padataa tha
 Due to this bridge, it will take less than two hours to reach Madhubani, whereas earlier it used to take 8-10 hours
 isse vakt hi nahin, paisa bhi bachegaa
 But that momentary rendezvous on the stage between Joshi and Nitish could not resolve the differences between Bihar and the Center over the state's national highways
 yah jaanate hue ki sadakon kii sudharti haalat ne bihar main rajg sarkaar ko kaaphi rajnatik phayda diya he, centre ne rashtriya rajmargon ko besahaara chhod diya he
 Bihar has the ninth longest national highways network in the country, and is completely decaying and full of pits
 bihar sarkaar chaahati he ki centre sarkaar ko rajya se guzarane vaale 'khastahal' rashtriya rajmargon kii sud leni chahie
 If she cannot do so, she wants to officially relinquish her responsibility and allow the state government to take care of them on her own
 bihar path nirmaan vibhaag ke sachiv pratyay amrit ne sadak parivahan or rajmarg mantralay ko haal main likhe apane patr main kaha he, ''rashtriya rajmargon ke adhiktar hisson kii haalat bahut kharaab he
 It is impossible to drive vehicles on them
 rashtriya rajmarg 101 or 103 kii durdasha ke kaaran to transportron or aam aadmi kaa jeena hi dubhar ho gaya he
 "the two national highways cited in Amrit's letter are very important in connecting important places in Bihar with each other
" rashtriya rajmarg 101 kii lambaai 60 kimi he jo chhapra ko gopalganj jile ke mohammadpur se jodta he jabaki 55 kimi lanbaa rashtriya rajmarg-103 samastipur main musharigharaadi ko hajipur se jodta he
 Incidentally, the improved condition of roads in Bihar has emerged as an important aspect of the story of change in the state
 isaki shuruyaat 2006-07 main hui
 State Road Construction Department 13,322
 80 kimi sadakon kaa nirmaan kar chukaa he
 When Nitish returned to power with an overwhelming majority in November 2010, a good reason for the confidence of the people in the NDA was considered to be the better road conditions
 lekin is sukhad kahani kaa ek dukhad pahalu bhi he
 And that is the national highways here, whose continuously deteriorating condition remains a matter of intense concern for the state government
 is durdasha ke maddenjar hi path nirmaan sachiv ne rajya sarkaar ke sansadhano ke jariye inamen sudhaar karne kii manshaa jataai he
 He has requested in his letter, "delegation of National Highways will enable the State Government to take appropriate steps to improve their condition
" ''rashtriya rajmargon kii jimmedaari lene kaa rajya sarkaar kaa suzav bemisaal lagata he
 But this also brings to light the state's frustration with the loss of care in national highways
 kul 70,394 kimi rashtriya rajmarg main se 3,642 kimi hi bihar main he
 That is why the state ranks ninth in terms of national highways in the country
 kuch hisson main rashtriya rajmargon kii kharaab haalat ne logon ke bihar ke kisi bhi hisse se chah ghante main patna pahunchane ke nitish ke khwab par kaali chaaya daali hui he
 Not only this, the plight of the national highways in the state is also a case study in how all the roads of Bihar looked at one time
 bihar se guzarane vaale rashtriya rajmargon main 1,000 kimi hissaa aisa he jis par vaahan daudane ke liye turant tavajjo die jane kii jarurat he
 The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) believes that national highways represent only 2 per cent of the road network, but they carry 40 per cent of the total road traffic
 rashtriya rajmargon ko bahut hi soch-samaj kar banaaya jaataa he, aise main in par yatayaat kaa boj din par din badhata hi ja rahaa he
 According to NHAI, 10 for the last five years
 6 fisadi kii salanaa ausat se vaahanon kii sankhya main ijapha hota ja rahaa he
 It can also be considered that the suggestion of the State Government to assume responsibility for the State Highways is a very thoughtful step
 centre ne pehle hi rajya sarkaar ko vah 1,000 karod ru
 Refuse to return what Bihar has spent over the last few years on national highways
 bihar ko yah paisa apane khajaane cell isliye kharch karnaa padaa kyonki sadakon kii haalat itani badtar ho chuki thi ki gadiyon ke aane jane main dikkat aane lagi thi
 While the central government was not paying any attention to this
 is raashi kaa upyog bihar se guzarane vaale 1951
 51 km was done to rebuild national highways
 lekin centre sarkaar kaa tark he ki sadak parivahan or rajmarg mantralay rajya ko us kaam ke liye paise kaa bhugtan nahin karegaa jise usne karwaane ke liye nahin kaha tha
 On the other hand, Bihar's Road Construction Minister Nand Kishore Yadav is also upset with this
 ve kehete hai, ''ham centre sarkaar se hamaare 1,000 karod ru
 Tired of saying to pay
 vah na to bihar kaa paisa lautaati he or na hi rashtriya rajmargon kii dekh-rekh karti he
 Therefore, we have asked them to take up the responsibility of national highways falling in the state themselves
 ''yahaan tak ki mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne pradhanmantri ko bhi isaki jaankaree di, lekin do sarkaron ke bich fanse is masale kaa koi samaadhaan nahin nikal sakaa
 It is said that not even a burnt buttermilk of milk is drunk
 aisa hi kuch bihar ke saath bhi he
 This time he is now seeking permission from the Center before spending the state money on national highways

 Tension has been seen between the US and Iran for a long time

 In response to this, US President Donald Trump has responded to Iran and tweeted that Iran has made a big mistake

 The US military did not react to the incident then
 lekin ab trump ke bayaan ke baad se saaf he ki donon deshon ke bich tanaav apane charam par he
 Earlier, the US military accused Iran of attacking two oil tankers on June 13 in the Gulf of Oman
 haalanki iran ne in aaropon ko khaarij kar diya tha
 Donald Trump separated the US from the nuclear deal in May last year and reimposed energy and economic sanctions on Iran
 iske baad donon deshon ke bich tanaav bad gaya
 In the last few weeks, the US has deployed a large amount of troops in the area under the pretext of Iran's threats
 pentagon ne somvaar ko madhya asia main 1,000 anya sainikon ko tainaat karne kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 Tensions between Washington and Tehran escalated last week after attacks on two oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman and Iran's 2015 nuclear deal were threatened
 vahiin, america ke saath badhate tanaav par iran ke raashtrapati hasan ruhani ne kaha tha ki unka desh kisi desh se yuddh nahin chahta
 However, he insisted that Iran would ultimately win any war against itself
 ruhani ne kaha, 'ham kisi desh ke saath yuddh nahin chhedenge, jo hamaare saamne hai ve kam anubhav vaale raajnneetigyon kaa ek samooh he
 As reported by Press TV, Rouhani's statement came the next day after US Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan announced the deployment of 1,000 more troops to the Middle East

 pakistan ke purv raashtrapati parvej musharraf ne kaha he ki raashtrapati bataur unke kaarykaal main donon desh kashmir or anya vivaadaaspad muddon par qaraar ke kareeb pahunch gayi the
 During a TV show when Musharraf was asked if the two countries were close to any agreement, he said, "yes of course
 kashmir, siachin or sar creek, in teenon muddon par kareeb the
 "musharraf said," i told Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and he was ready
 unke pakistan aane kii baari thi or hamane faisla kiya tha ki yadi vah aate hai or bhale hi teenon par nahin sahi lekin in teenon main se ek par bhi dastakhat nahin hote to yah puri tarah vifaltaa hogi, jo kabhi nahin hona chahie
 So we agreed that when he comes, there will be agreement on at least one of these three
 ’’jab musharraf se poocha gaya ki kya yah mudda sar creek tha to unhone kaha, ‘‘haa, sar creek kii sambhaavna adhik thi lekin anya donon par bhi acchhee pragati kii gayi thi
 "the former Pak President said," The decision on Siachen was very easy
 meraa maananaa he ki ham ek chote se mudde ko lekar bahut bhavuk ho rahe hai or un phaaydon ko nakaar rahe hai, jinhen ham hasil kar sakate hai
 According to the irrelevant Thamushraf, the Kashmir issue was based on three principles, demilitarization, self-government and joint system
 unhone kaha ki yah unka hi vichaar tha ki kashmir ke adanr or niyantran rekha par visanikaran jari rahanaa chahie
 He said, "and we should have similar action on our side
" meraa suzav tha ki bhartiya sena ko srinagar, baraamula jaise do yaa teen shaharon se hatana chahie
 "by self-government," Musharraf refers to giving maximum rule to the people of Kashmir, both on the Indian side and on the Pakistan side
 ’’ sanyukt pranali kaa makasad swashaasan par nigaraanee rakhana he
 Musharraf said that as far as Kashmir was concerned, the idea of creating a Line of Control in Pakistan was irrelevant
 unhone kaha, ‘‘samasya niyantran rekha thi kyonki is tarah kii dharna thi ki bhartiya paksh chahta he ki niyantran rekha ko sthaayee banaaya jaae
 From our side we thought that this is a dispute and therefore a dispute cannot be resolved
 isliye niyantran rekha banane kaa vichaar apraasangik tha
 "" Helping in the investigation of Mumbai terror attacks "musharraf said that if he were the President, he would have helped in the investigation of Mumbai terror attacks
 unhone kaha, ‘‘nishchit taur par ham jaanch main madad karte kyonki ham nahin chaahate ki pakistan kii sarkaar yaa sena yaa iesai ko sayipradhi yaa jimmedaar tehraaya jaae
 Because it is generally done that in whatever happened they were accomplices
 ham jaanch main shaamil hote or jisane bhi ise anjaam diya tha, use kathghare main laate
 Regarding Hafiz Mohammed Saeed, accused of the attacks, he said, "I have no concern with the courts, the petitions and whatever happened in their dismissal, but if there is evidence against them then proceedings should definitely go against those people
" 
 ’’ musharraf ne kaha, ‘‘puure kadam uthaaye jane chahie or mumbai main jis tarah kaa aparaadh hua, vah aatankwaadi hamalaa tha or isliye pakistan ko madad kerani chahie
 Another problem is sharing of intelligence so that the Pakistani side fully cooperates
 ’’ kya vah mumbai hamalon ke maamle main giraftaar logon se poochtacha karne ke liye epabiai ko manaa kar dete, is sawaal par musharraf ne kaha, ‘‘main is par tippanee nahin kar sakuunga
 Because i don't know if the case is that they detained some people and are denying contact with the FBI
 ’’ Former Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf has denied the claims of his own country on terrorist Masood Azhar
 musharraf ne kabool kiya he ki unke kaarykaal ke dauraan aatanki sanghathan jaish-e-mohammad ne khufia agenciyon ke ishaaron par bharat main hamale kiye the
 Explain that ISI is Pakistan's largest intelligence agency, which is notorious for conducting such attacks in India
 jaish par pehle hi kadam uthaaya janaa chahie thaphilhal dubai main rah rahe musharraf ne jaish-e-mohammad par pakistan sarkaar kii karrwai kaa swaagat kiya he
 He has said that this is a good move
 maine hameshaa se kaha he ki jaish-e-mohammad ek aatankwaadi sanghathan he or usne do baar meri bhi hatya kii sajeesh rachi
 Action should be taken against him
 saath hi purv raashtrapati ne kaha ki jaish ke khilaaf bahut pehle hi kadam uthaaya janaa chahie tha
 So could not take action on Jaish when he was asked why he did not take any action against Jaish while in power? So Musharraf said that the time was different
 hamaari khufia agency ke log bharat-pakistan ke bich jaise ko taisa vaali sthiti main lage hue the
 At the time all this was going on and no major action was taken against Jaish and i did not insist on it either
 paak main jaish ko lekar badalte bayandesh main jaish-e-mohammad kii maujuudagi ko lekar pakistan or uski sena kii ore se samay-samay par bayaan badalte rahe hai
 Last month, Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi said in an interview to CNN that Masood Azhar is present in Pakistan, but the government can take action against him only if India gives concrete and indelible evidence of his involvement in the Pulwama attack that ticks the court Can
 haalanki, pakistani sena ne desh main aatankwaadi samooh kii maujuudagi se inkaar kiya
 In the Pulwama attack, Jaish was informed that Jaish had claimed responsibility for the recent Pulwama attack on February 14, after which tensions in india-pakistan have increased
 is hamale main siarpief ke 40 jawan shahid ho gaye the
 In retaliation, the Indian Air Force conducted an airstrike at the terrorists' bases in the Pakistan border, in which Jaish is reported to have killed 200-300 terrorists
 iske baad antarrashtriya dabaav badhane ke bich pakistan ne ajahar ke bete or uske bhai samet 44 aatankwaadiyon ko hiraasat main le liya
 Maharashtra DGP Ajit Parasanis said investigators are on the verge of resolving the July 13 blasts in Mumbai and hoped that 'the matter will be revealed soon
 ’ ek din pehle hi unhone kaha tha ki visphot ke liye jimmedaar aatankwaadi sanghathan kii pahchaan kar lee gayi he
 The Prime Minister, who met the injured in the Mumbai blast, said about the investigation into the triple blast, "the matter will be revealed soon
" unke (aties or aparaadh shakha ke adhikari) paas kaaphi suchanaaen evam samagriyaan hai
 They have also come to know who is behind the blasts but it is not appropriate to reveal the group's name at the moment
 ’ yah poochne par ki kya maamle kii jaanch kar rahe aties or aparaadh shakha ke adhikari maamle ko ujagar karne ke kagaar par hai to unhone kaha, ‘is bare main jald ghoshnaa kii ja sakati he
 Tributes paid to those killed in the Mumbai blast DGP in Kolhapur, Maharashtra said that the group involved in the attack was traced
 mahanagar main 13 july kii shaam ko jhaveri bazaar, opera house or dadar main teen bam visphot hue the jisamen 27 logon kii maut ho gayi thi or 130 se zyada log ghayal ho gayi the
 Police sources said investigators suspect the role of the Indian Mujahideen terrorist organization and the case is being investigated accordingly
 mumbai blast: dilli police ne kol intercept kiyaunhone kaha ki aties ne haal main indian mujahiddeen ke do sadasyon mohammad haaron or asraar tailor ko jaali noton ke silsile main giraftaar kiya tha or visphot ke bare main unase vistrut poochtacha kii gayi
 Mumbai Blast: One person died during interrogation andhra pradesh ke mudde par loksabhaa main pichley saptaahabhar se jari hangaame or narebaaji ke bich samaajawaadee pramukh mulaayam singh somvaar ko asana se naaraaz ho gaye or kaha ki is prakaar hangaame ke bich kaise sadan chalaaya ja rahaa he
 Speaker Sumitra Mahajan, however, strongly opposed his charge, saying that if any thing happens, the leaders of all the parties are called and discussed
 shoonyakaal main wiesar congress ke sadasyon dwaara andhra pradesh ko vishesh rajya kaa darja die jane kii maang ko lekar jab asana ke samaksh narebaaji kii ja rahi thi to isi bich mulaayam singh khadey hue or asana se kaha ki kabhi ham logon ko bhi bolne kaa mauka den
 On this, Mulayam Singh got angry when the Speaker tried to make his point laugh
 unhone kaha, ‘‘aap hansi main hamaari baat ko taal rahi hai
 Democracy runs through dialogue
 bade-bade spikar dekhe hai hamane
 He questioned the ways of the Speaker as the Speaker of the House

 samajasevi anna hajaare ne pradhanmantri narendra modi ko letters likhakar bhrashtachar or kisaanon kii samasyaon par apni naaraazgi jaahir kii thi
 However, when the letter is not answered, now Anna has decided to agitate
 anna ne letters main likhaa tha ki chah saal baad bhi bhrashtachar ko rokane vaale ek bhi kanoon par amal nahin ho paaya
 The government is showing slackness on all strong bills to appoint Lokpal, Lokayukta and to prevent corruption
 kisaanon kii samasyaon ko lekar swaminathan ayog kii report par bhi amal nahin kiya ja rahaa he
 Annoyed by this attitude of the government, Anna Hazare wrote about all the issues in the letter and has now decided to agitate in Delhi, with no response
 6 saal ho gaye andolan keinna hajarene bhrashtachar mukt bharat ko banane ke liye 2011 main ramlila maidan main andolan kiya tha
 After this, on August 27, 2011, the resolution was passed in the Indian Parliament from 'sense of the House'
 isamen centre main lokapal, har rajyon main lokayukta or citijan charter aise mahatvapurn muddon par jald se jald kanoon banane kaa nirnay kiya gaya tha
 After this, Anna Hazare postponed his agitation
 ise lekar 6 saal guzar chuke hai
 'BJP did not fulfill its promise', Anna Hazare said in a letter written to Modi, that the BJP, which was playing the role of opposition in both houses of Parliament, also gave full support to this law when Kilokpal and Lokayuktakan were formed
 iske baad hue 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main aapaki party sarkaar bani
 After the Lokpal movement, the people of the country had chosen a new government under your leadership with great hope
 vahiin nai sarkaar ko muddon par amal karne ke liye paryaapt samay dena jaruri tha
 Anna Hazare also mentioned writing letters several times in the last three years, but received no reply from the PMO
 itnaa hi nahin naa kabhi man kii baat main lokapal or lokayukta kaa zikr kiya gaya
 He has written that before coming to power you had assured that we would create a corruption-free India
 haalanki aap 3 saal se lokapal or lokayukta kii niyukti nahin kar sake
 The Supreme Court has also reprimanded your government repeatedly
 modi ne kaha ki jin rajyon main bijepi kii sarkarein hai, vahaan bhi naye kanoon ke tahat lokayukta niyukt nahin kiye gayi hai
 It is clear from this that you are not showing the will to implement the Lokpal, Lokayukta law
 kisaanon kii samasya par bhi nahin diya javadhanna hajaare ne desh main lagaataar kisaanon kii aatmahatya kaa bhi zikr kiya he
 According to Anna, at the present time, farmers received a price-based price in the farming yields, so i wrote several times
 haalanki na aapaki taraf se koi jawaab aayaa or na hi swaminathan kamity kii report par karrwai hui
 For this reason, farmers have been agitating in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Haryana, Rajasthan for the last several days
 saath hi letters main anna ne rajnatik partiyon ko soochna ke adhikaar ke daayre main laane kii maang bhi kii
 Now Anna Hazare said through the letter that in the last 3 years your government has not responded to any letter
 iske liye ab maine dilli main andolan karne kaa nirnay liya he
 i will continue the agitation in Delhi till the right decision and implementation in public interest on the issues written in the letter
 anna hajaare ne agle patr main andolan kii taarikh kii ghoshnaa karne kii baat kahi he

 sarkari kaamkaaj or arthvyavastha ke taur-tareeke badalane ke apane iraadon ke liye charchit narendra modi kii najar main sarkaar kii adarsh bhoomika, bilashak, apane purvavartiyon se ekadam alag he
 He believes that the size and type of government is not as important
 ve kehete hai ki uskaa dayera, jitna sambhav ho, sankshipt hona chahie
 The Prime Minister has used the two jumals frequently since he began to rise from the post of Chief Minister of Gujarat to establish his strong presence on the national stage
 ye jumale hai ''nunatam sarkaar, adhiktam sushasan'' or ''kaarobaar karnaa sarkaar kaa kaam nahin he
 "his critics believe that these jumlas are largely reflections of his thinking in terms of economy and administration
 jis desh main ab tak kabhi bhi raajnneeti or rajnatik vyavastha main spasht rup se dakshinpanthi bazaar samarthak rujhaan nahin dikhaa he, vahaan ye do jumale spasht rup se modi yug ke aagaman ke pratik hai
 This era is the first time in independent India of any government leaning towards right wing
 kendriya mantrimandal main modi ke daaen haath kahalaane vaale vitt mantri arun jetali ne 28 farvari ko is modi aarthiki ke liye laal kaaleen bicha diya
 Although not fully laid out yet
 bajet main sarkaar kaa dayera nahin failaayaa lekin kuch maamalon main sarkari bhoomikaayen ghataane se bhi ruk gaye
 What he said in his more than 11,500-word budget speech can be called the Modi government's apt, budget-oriented budget towards the right-wing
 yah bajet puri tarah bazaar samarthak bhale na ho, phir bhi bade or chote, donon tarah ke kaarobaariyon or desi-videshi companiyon ko lalachaane ke liye kaaphi he, jo 'mek in india' main saajheedaar hone ko taiyaar hai
 Jaitley had tried to please everyone in his first interim budget last July, but in his first full budget he has tried to avoid the temptation to please people for a short time
 isamen na to saamaajik kshetra ke loklubhaavan upayon se aam janata ko or na hi bade-bade sudhaaron kii ghoshnaa se korporate jagat ko lubhaane kii koi koshish kii gai he
 Of course Jaitley has refused to enter the arena of popularity war with the previous UPA government under the leadership of the Congress
 upie ne jis tarah se 2006 ke bajet main rashtriya gramin rojgaar guarantee yojana ke tahat pehle 200 jilon ke liye 11,000 karod ru
 Had allocated Rs
 40,000 crore in 2009
 kar diya tha, us tarah ke baari-bharkam aavanton ke anupasthiti ne rajkoshiya niyantran ke samarthakon or niveshkon ko avashya raahat di hogi
 Nevertheless, Jaitley has spilled some water at the moment on the expectations of the business and industry's booming reform announcements
 unhone isaki bajaae kaarobaar ke liye sthir or niyam aadhaarit maahaul banane kii khatir adhik niamak or vidhaayi prastaav laane kaa vaada kiya he
 These promises include creating a comprehensive code for bankruptcy, drafting legislation that pre-empts regulatory mechanisms in place of many prior permissions, a Public Agreement (dispute Settlement) Bill for settlement of disputes in public agreements, Bringing another bill for early resolution of commercial disputes, merging the Forward Markets Commission with Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) And at least Rs 500 crore
 kii parisampatti vaali gaiyr-banking vittiya companiyon ko 'vittiya sansthaaon' kii shrenee main laana shaamil he
 This is undoubtedly an attempt to create an environment conducive to business, which has been torturing at the hands of arbitrary and discretionary system for years
 jetali ne kar prastaavon main thodaa pherbadal kar apni gambhirtha kaa sanket de diya he
 These include increasing service tax, moving towards Goods and Services Tax (GST) and non-tampering of Direct Taxes Code (DTC)
 centre ke rajasav main rajyon kii hissedari das pratishat badhaane ke chaudaaven vitt ayog ke faisle kaa sabhi partiyon ne swaagat kiya tha
 Jaitley showed no hesitation in this matter, even though his move seems to be in the interest of companies, but his aim is to compete with the South Asian economies, which have been able to take a large share of foreign investment on their own competence
 
 jetali ne is disha main dohari chaal chali he: ek to 2019 tak company kar ko maujuuda 30 pratishat se ghataakar dhire-dhire 25 pratishat karne kaa vaayada kar diya or puunji aakarshith karne ke liye kar dhaanche main bhi pherbadal kiya
 Jaitley declared, "the current tax structure encourages fund managers to operate from abroad
" videshi thikaanon se kaam karne vaale aise fund prabandhakon ko bharat aane ke liye protsaahit karne ke vaaste main sthaayee pratishthan (pii) niyamon main is aashay ke sanshodhan kaa prastaav karata hum kii fund prabandhak kii sirf bharat main upasthiti kaa arth videshi fundon kaa pii nahin mana jayega, jiske kaaran un par kar kaa boj padataa tha
 "this shows what their ultimate goal is - to encourage fund managers working from Singapore and Malaysia to establish a base in India
" iske alaava unhone shrenee-k or shrenee-kha, donon vaikalpik nivesh nidhiyon ko 'tex paas thru' kii anumati de di he taaki kar kii dendaree in nidhiyon main nivesh karne waalon par ho, pratinidhiyon par nahin
 The budget states that its objective is to increase the 'capacity of these funds to raise more resources' for investment in new ventures in the country
 pehle kii vampanth kii ore jhuki arthniti se ek kadam or dur hataate hue jetali ne bazaar sanchalit saamaajik suraksha vyavastha kii taraf bhi kuch chote-chote kadamon kaa sanket diya he, jisase khaadya guarantee yaa rojgaar guarantee yojana kii tarah sari jimmedaari sarkaar par na aae balki labhaarthi bhi uske kuch hisse kaa vahan karen
 Whether Rs
 12 vaarshik premium par 2 lakh ru
 Be an accident insurance plan of Rs
 330
 vaarshik bhugtan par 2 lakh ru
 Of natural death insurance scheme or fixed contribution pension scheme in which half the amount of premium per year, maximum one thousand rupees
 tak sarkaar degi
 Anyone can participate in these schemes, but mostly they will be adopted by those sitting at the lowest end of the society
 niyamit vetan paane vaale sangathit kshetra ke karmchaariyon ko bajet ne apane saamaajik suraksha saadhan or uske aakaar ko chunane kaa vikalp diya he
