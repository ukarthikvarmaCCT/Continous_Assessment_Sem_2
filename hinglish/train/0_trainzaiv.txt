 The parking dispute is at the core of a violent clash between lawyers and policemen that took place on November 2 in the Tis Hazari court of the capital Delhi
 is jhagade kaa nateeja chaahe jo kuch ho lekin vakeelon ke hadtaal par chale jane se desh ke kai hisson main adaalat aane vaale lakhon logon ko takalif kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 The video of a lawyer who slaps a bike-riding policeman on social media is of Delhi's Saket Court on Monday
 tees hajaari adaalat main hinsa kaa shanivaar ko hui or uskaa ghatnakram jaananaa isliye jaruri he ki ye bataata he ki kis tarah choti si ghatana itani badi ho jaati he
 Outside the lockup of the prisoners, the lawyers parked their car, at which the policemen stationed there stopped them
 iske baad jhagada badha or vakeelon kii fouj ikatthi ho gai
 Lawyers set fire to police vehicles
 ek police ne goli chalaai jisamen kuch vakil jakhmi hue
 Media reports state that the lawyer became more angry due to the rumor that the lawyer died from the police bullet
 vakil kehete hai ki pulisavaalon ne unke saathiyon ko lowep main band kar peetna shuru kar diya tha
 Policemen say the lawyers wanted to free the prisoners from the lockup
 donon pakshon ke bich hinsa kaa patakshep police ke lathicharge se hua
 The next day i
e
 on Sunday, the court of the Chief Justice of the Delhi High Court, taking automatic cognizance, ordered the incident to be conducted by a retired judge and action on the policeman who fired
 sibiai, ibi ke afasar jaanch main madad karenge
 Six firs have been registered in this violence from different sides
 somvaar ko dilli kii sabhi nichali adaalaton main vakil hadtaal par chale gaye
 Some IPS officers have also come on the field after the lawyer police clash
 vakeelon ke khilaaf pulisavaalon or unke pariwaron ne bhi dinabhar police mukhyalay par pradarshan kiya
 This is the first demonstration of the policemen of Delhi
 dilli police ke hajaaron andolankaaree karmchaariyon ko tamilnadu, haryana aadi ke pulicekarmiyon kaa samarthan bhi mil gaya he
 Lawyers in many high courts and lower courts of the country went on strike against the lawyers of Delhi
 is hadtaal se takalif un logon ko hui jo adaalat main apane mukademe ke silsile main aae the
 Lawyers strike has become very common in the country
 donon par hi lagaam lagane kii jarurat he
 Both need to be made responsible
 pulisavaalon or vakeelon kaa hadtaal par janaa behad gambhir masalaa he
 In 2017, the Law Commission recommended that there should be a complete ban on lawyers' strike or boycott of their work and a provision for punishment should also be made
 vidhi ayog ne hadataali vakeelon ke baar kaa chunaav ladane par pabandi lagane kaa suzav diya tha
 In addition, the Commission had suggested setting up of an Advocate Grevens Redressal Committee to deal with the problems of lawyers to curb the strike, which was recommended to be headed by a judicial officer
 iske tahat hoicourt samvidhan ke anuchhed 235 ke tahat mili apane adhikaron kaa prayog kar ek circular jari kar cameti kaa gathan kar sakate hai or vakeelon ke vivaad hal ho sakate hai
 Similarly, police reforms are constantly hanging to make the police responsible
 police ke belgaum hone ke vaakye aksar pesh aate rahete hai
 Police is uncontrollable due to the control being in the hands of power and the methods of acting selectively
 haalanki mote taur par is paimaane par dilli police ko nahin rakhaa ja saktaa
 Delhi Police can be said to be more professional than the police of other states, but all the restraints and rules are broken when they get in the trap
 police par kaam kaa dabaav betahasha rahata he
 According to the UN recommendations, there should be 222 policemen per one lakh population, but India effectively had 137 policemen in 2016
 aparaadh kii dar 2005 se 2015 ke bich prati lakh aabaadi par 28 fisad bad gai lekin rajyon kii police kii sankhya jo pehle se hi 24 fisad karmchaariyon kii kami se jujh rahi thi, ko badhaane kii koi charchaa tak nahin kii gai
 Things like modernization of police are not even discussed
 police waalon ko saptahik avkaash, duty ke ghante jaisi suvidhaon kii bhi baat nahin hoti
 The quarrel was over a small issue like parking, which the Bar Association of Tis Hazari and the police officers stationed there could resolve with discretion but it did not happen
 vidhi centre for legal policy ke 2019 ke survey ke mutabik, desh ke 80 fisad court parisaron main alag se parking kii vyavastha he
 But except in Saket, Rohini and Rouse Avenue courts in the Delhi case, the parking situation is quite poor in the Supreme Court and other lower courts, including the High Court
 in adaalaton ke raaston par parking kii badtar sthiti kii vajah se trephic jam hota he
 This clash between lawyers and police is like a road rage incident
 bas ye jhagada ab do taqatvar samoohon kaa ban gaya he
 Politics gains strength from both these groups
 is ghatana main donon taraf gussa he, aakrosh he
 Both organizations are bent on agitation, taking the form of pressure groups
 donon kaam nahin karenge to mushkil logon kii badhegi
 If the people coming into the profession directly related to the people like government work and advocacy will agitate, then the system will be broken
 police or vakil donon ke peshon main sudhaar kii jarurat he

 Unbeatable Durga: Devdatta Patnaik etc
 Durga, symbol of power-maya, is invincible
 vah ek hi samay main dulhan bhi hai or yoddha bhi
 She establishes a home in a form, gives happiness, produces children and provides food
 duusare rup main vah rankshetra main jaati hai or hatyaein karti hai
 The one who comes to their refuge protects them and destroys the one who challenges them
 vah sher ko bhi shant kar use sawari bana leti hai
 She never ties her hair
 mahisasur vatsuron ke raja mahisasur ne brahma se ek vardaan lene main kamyaabi hasil kii thi, jiske baad unhen ped paudhe, jaanavar, aadmi, asur yaa bhagwaan main se koi bhi maar nahin saktaa tha
 The mighty Mahishasura drove the Devas away from Nabha Mandal
 ve apane janak brahma ke paas gaye
 Brahma sent him to Vishnu and Vishnu to Shiva
 shiv ne nirdesh diya ki saare dev apni shaktiyaan baahar nikaalen or ekatrit karke shakti kaa nirmaan karen
 The devas exerted their powers in the form of flames, out of which the eight-handed warrior goddess Durga appeared, riding a lion
 mahish unke pyaar main funs gaye or unhen apni patni bananaa chaahate the
 Mahish sent his messengers to her with this message
 durga ne jawaab diya ki ladaai main agar vah unhen haraa de tabhi shaadi ho paaegi
 Mahish sent several fighters to bring them but they failed
 devi ne ek-ek kar sabko maar diya
 In the end, Mahish attacked him
 iske liye vah jaanwaron ke rup dhaaran kar rahaa tha
 He was attacking as a lion, an elephant, a buffalo
 nau raaton tak chali bheeshan ladaai ke baad durga ne trishul se maar kar uski igalila samaapt kar di
 She was successful because Mahish had not taken the gift of saving life from the woman
 (markandeya puraana)asur or devmahishasur kii maut ho yaa kisi or asur kii maut, iske baad kii shanti adhik arase tak nahin chalati thi
 Soon a new Asura was born and the cycle of victory and defeat continued
 aisa lagata he ladaai shanti kii pratikriya thi or isaki ulti prakriya bhi chalati thi
 There is a kind of rhythm in the changing fate of Devas and Asuras
 koi bhi hameshaa ke liye parajeet nahin he
 Both seem to be on par
 ye sanket detaa he ki sansar ke astitv ke liye asur bhi aavashyak hai
 There will be no balance without them
 ishwar kabhi asur ko nasht nahin karte hai
 Asura is shown only his place
 hindu jagat main asur dharti ke neeche pataal lok main bane shahar hiranyapur main rahete hai
 Dev resides in Amravati, a city built above the sky
 donon lokon ke bich kii jagah hi ladaai kaa maidan he
 Below is the story of Bali who was kind but his presence on the earth deteriorated the balance of the three worlds
 vyavastha tabhi behaal hui jab shiv ne use uski jagah dikhaa di yani dharti ke neeche bhej diya
 Vishnu, who took the form of the king of the Asuras as Balavishal and hoisted the victory over the three worlds, is called Vishnu Trivikram
 pataal lok main bhej die gaye asuron ke raja baali har saal ek baar fasal katane samay upar aate hai
 In Kerala, his arrival is celebrated as Onam festival
 vahiin uttar bharat main is avasar par diwali manaate hai
 Interestingly, every festival related to crops is related to the death of Asuras
 dashahra durga ke haathon mahisasur vadh kaa pratik he or diwali krishna ke haathon narak or trivikram ke haathon baali kii haar se sambandhit he
 The death of Asuras is not related to the festival of harvesting of crops
 sanjivani vidya ke paalak ke taur par asur dharti kii urvartaa behaal karte rahete hai
 And only after killing the asura and cutting the crop can the dhaana be given in its share
 pataal lok or fasalon kii kataai se asuron ke sambandh, baali kii dayalutaa or ye tathy ki uskaa shahar sone se bana hua he ye sanket detaa he ki asur dhan ke sangrakshak hai
 All wealth, be it plant or animal or mineral, all originate from under the earth
 yahaan tak ki lakshmi ke bare main bhi kaha jaataa he ki wo pataal main rahati hai
 Dev releases the money kept in the asuras
 surya bhagwaan apni garmi or prakaash ke sahare paudhon ko upar akaash kii ore badhane main madad karte hai
 The lunar god controls the ocean waves which helps in killing fish and extracting salt
 akaash ke devtaa indra monsoon ke badal bhejte hai jisase barish hoti he
 The gods of wind help to bring down the rivers from the air mountains
 aag ke devtaa agni pattharon ko pighalaate hai jisase dhaatu nikalataa he
 Asuras are considered more powerful in the situation when the Sun turns south from Dakshinayan and moves towards Cancer
 tab din chote or raaten sard ho jaati hai
 Even when the moon starts to shrink, the power of Asuras increases
 asur raat ko adhik shaktishaalee hote hai
 Asuras complete the cycle of days, months and years with the Devas
 shiv or shaktimausam aate hai, jate hai
 Culture rises and falls
 mulya badal jate hai
 Standards are variable
 sansaarik satya sharton se jude dikhte hai
 It is relative to the views of place, time and people
 shiv wo bhagwaan hai jo in sansaarik satyataon main yakeen nahin rakhte
 He discovers the truth that is permanent, complete and unconditional
 isliye vah duniya kii ore se apni ankhen band rakhte hai
 He refuses to place memories, desires, thoughts and ego into his mind
 chitt kii shuddhta hi gyanoday kii ore le jaati he
 Along with enlightenment comes bliss, a peaceful boon
 ye vardaan sabhi ichchhaaon ke upar he
 There is no urge to feel and react
 sharir yaa duniya kii bhi koi jarurat nahin he
 There is no action, reaction or accountability
 karm nahin he, isliye sansar nahin he
 The world does not exist
 jo bhi astitv main he wo he aatma jo khud ke liye srujit ekant main he
 Therefore Shiva is the destroyer god of the world
 ek, ek aisi sankhya he jo nishpraan he, oosar he
 When there is only one, then there is neither love nor desire nor confluence
 kisi bhi rishte ko banane ke liye kam se kam do kii jarurat hoti he
 There is no existence without the other
 sat yaa satya ko mahasoos karne ke liye maaya kii jarurat he; maaya kaa matlab sharton ke saath sansaarik sachchaaiyaan
 Energy restlessness is needed to understand the silence of the soul
 devi maaya hai jo sabhi bhramon ko aatmsaat karti hai
 They are power, the subjective form of energy
 vah aadi hai
 Means as ancient and borderless soul
 samay, sthaan or faislon ke aadhaar par vah utani hi junglee or daraavnee ho sakati hai jitani kaali
 But on the other hand she can be as kind and sweet as Gauri
 vah duniya hai jisase shiv ne apane ko dur rakhaa he
 She will try to bring love to his heart, force him to open his eyes and try to bring him to earthly life
 pyaar divine antartam kaa sampark divine bahari duniya se karaayega
 This ardor and confluence will give legitimacy to the existence of all things

 There is not even an open terrace, but now we want them to have all these facilities

 If this scheme works, shops in Connaught Place will be open till 11 pm and restaurants will be open till 1 pm
 abhi ye 11 baje raat tak khule rahenge
 But for this it is necessary that the restaurant owner, shopkeeper and police should be considered

 The era of 1990 and the style of Thackeray now let us take you back 29 years from the current politics
 wo daur 1990 kaa tha
 Bal Thackeray's star was elevated in Maharashtra politics
 1990 main jab maharashtra vidhansabha ke chunaavon kii ghoshnaa hui to bijepi or shivasena pehali baar saath aae or saath milakar congress ko takkar dene par sahmati bani
 When there was talk of seat-sharing, Bala Saheb Thackeray had called Prakash Javadekar and late Pramod Mahajan for talks
 baatcheet ke dauraan bala sahib ne bijepi netaaon ko do took kaha tha ki 288 main maatr 88 siten bijepi ko di jaaegi, isse zyada is maamle par koi charchaa nahin hogi
 According to a report published in the Indian Express, it has been revealed by Prakash Javadekar himself
 ise bhi padhein: 29 saal main kaise badal gaya bjp-shivasena kaa seat shering formulabijepi ko mili thi 104 sitembijapi is dauraan maharashtra kii raajnneeti kii nai khilaadi thi

 Shiv Sena contested 183 seats
 is chunaav main bijepi or shivesna sanyukt rup se 94 siten jeetin
 Out of 183 seats, Shiv Sena won 52 seats and BJP got 42 seats out of 104 seats
 2019 kaa formulapichley 29 saalon main maharashtra kii raajnneeti main amul-chul badlaav hue hai
 BJP, which once played the role of younger brother in Maharashtra, has now come in the role of Big Brother
 2014 loksabhaa or vidhansabha chunaav ke baad bijepi ne apni takat main or bhi ijapha kiya
 This time when the Shiv Sena got 124 seats, the reporters asked Uddhav Thackeray how the Shiv Sena reached a compromise
 to uddhav thakare ne kaha tha ki shivasena marathaon or chhatrapati maharaj ke alaava kisi ke saamne sir nahin nawati he
 He had said that we had made some compromises to form an alliance, but this agreement was in the interest of Maharashtra
 unhone kaha tha ki ve un shiv sainikon se maafee maangate hai jinaki siten sahyogi dalon ke paas chali gai he
 Rawat said that now we will be able to start afresh and this is necessary for the interest of the state
 unhone kaha ki hamane modi sarkaar kaa hameshaa saath diya he or aage bhi puraa sahyog karenge
 Please tell that for six months now, Harish Rawat ji's government will only run because for six months now he will not need to prove his majority

 The Gandhi family has been winning the Amethi Lok Sabha seat for so many years, but Rahul Gandhi never took care of Amethi

 He said, 'smriti Irani came to Amethi during the last Lok Sabha election
 wo us baar chunaav haar gai thim, lekin iske baavjood vahaan jis tareeke se logon ke sukh-dukh main khadi hai, isse main bahut prabhavit hua
 This also inspired me to leave the Congress and join the BJP

 People are very angry with him
 aise main rahul gandhi kaa chunaav haarana sambhav he
 Meanwhile, Bharatiya Janata Party leader Mohsin Raza said that doctors come from a reputed family of Muslim Amethi
 wo do baar vidhayak rahe hai
 Not only this, he has been very close to the Congress and especially the Gandhi family and has been a major contributor to the victory of the Congress from Amethi
 haalanki, ab inkaa bhi moh congress parivaar se bhang ho chukaa he
 Now the writing of Rahul Gandhi's defeat is being written here

 US President Donald Trump has linked his reputation to building a wall on the Mexican border
 donald trump ne kaha he ki avaidh pravaasiyon ko america seemaa main pravesh se rokane ke liye desh kii dakshini mexico seemaa par diwaar ke liye dhan jutaney ke liye vah neshnal immergency ghoshit karne ke kareeb pahunch rahe hai
 Let me tell you that if a national emergency is declared in the US, Donald Trump will take steps towards building a wall without the approval of Congress and he will get the executive power to spend the disaster relief fund in building the wall
 trump ne america news channel sibies news ke 'phase da nesan' kaarykram main kaha ki border sicurity par democrate seenetteron ke saath baatcheet sirf samay kii barbaadi he
 Trump also accused the Speaker of the US House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi of taking a stubborn stance and doing cheap politics
 trump ne kaha,‘‘main samajhataa hum ki vah bahut adiyal hai-jisaki mujhe aashaa bhi thi-main samajhataa hum ki vah desh ke liye kharaab hai
 They know you need a blocker, they know that we need border security
 phir bhi mul rup se vah khuli seemaa ke paksh main hai, unhen maanav taskari kii tanik bhi parvaah nahin he
 "the US President said that Pelosi is putting billions of dollars on the country with his obstinate attitude on this wall, and it is meaningless
" trump ne gusse main kaha, ‘vah hamaare desh ko bhayankar nuksaan pahunchaa rahi hai
 "the US President outlined his plans for the future and said," Our eyes are on the Emergency because i don't think anything is going to happen
 main samajhataa hum ki democrate seemaa suraksha nahin chaahate hai
 And when i hear them saying that the walls are against the law and the walls will not talk, i think they know that they are useful
 ’is bich pelocy karyaalay ne trump par laaparvaahee bhare bayaan dene kaa aarope lagaaya
 Nancy Pelosi spokeswoman Drew Hamill said, "president Trump's careless statement does not make us safe
 35 din ho gaye hamaare border petrol agent, drug enforcement administration agents, epabiai agents or homeland sicurity ke staff ko tankhwaah nahin mili hai
 "he further said that the Democrat Party had proposed strong effective and smart security measures at the bilateral conference committee meeting, but the president is still refusing to notice it, he is still adamant on the second shutdown

 The trailer video of Bollywood actor Siddharth Malhotra and Parineeti Chopra starrer film Jabariya Jodi has been released
 trailor kaaphi kaichi he or ise kuch hi ghante main utyub par 45 lakh se zyada baar dekha ja chukaa he
 The story of the film is about a boy getting married, who falls in love with a girl
 baad main jab ladkaa shaadi kii baat taalane lagata he to ladki uske saath pakadava vivaah karne kii baat kahati he
 What is the catch marriage? The story of the film may seem a little funny, but the reality is that it sheds light on a very serious problem in Bihar
 bihar main aisi ghatnaayen bahut aam hai
 When youngsters are kidnapped and forcibly married to a girl
 ye vivaah kai baar duulhe ko gan point par rakhkar bhi karwaae jate hai
 This is frightening because the girl and the boy are forced to marry and are beaten up too much for refusal
 kyon or kaise hota he pakadava vivaah?is kism kii shaadiyaan tab hoti hai jab ladke vaale log zyada dahej kii maang karne lagen yaa shaadi kii baat tay hone ke baad bachout kar jaaen
 In most cases, the reason is dowry
 aise main ladki kii taraf ke log un gangs se sampark karte hai, jo pakadava vivaah karaate hai
 These gangs kidnap the boy and forcefully marry him to the girl
 pakadava vivaah karaane waalon main ek dilachasp pahalu ye bhi he ki kai baar ye log profeshnal nahin hote, balki aise pariwaron ke log hote hai jinhone dahej se judi samasyaon ko jhela he, yaa jo iske khilaaf hai
 Many times even those who get hold of marriages cannot give dowry for their daughter
 aise main majabuuran unhen ye rasta chunanaa padataa he

 balki bahut acchhee baat he
 The value of the service must also be determined
 sawaal seva kaa he
 Nuts are easily associated with service
 seva kya he? seva karm he
 What is nuts Nuts are fruits
 karm karne se fal miltaa he, to seva karne se mewa bhi milegi
 What to do if you get nuts after serving? Service should be abandoned
 yaa hamen yun hi seva karte rahanaa chahie
 How long can such a service be done? Can Motivation continue in the service without nuts? This question is also valid
 sawaal madar terresa kii seva par uthaa he
 The motive behind his service has been questioned
 madar terresa ne khud likhaa he, 'vah 10 sitambar 1946 kaa din tha jab main apane vaarshik avkaash par darjeeling ja rahi thi
 At the same time, my conscience was raised that i should abandon everything and dedicate my life to the service of God and the poor Narayan

 main jisas kii seva main hum - or meraa kaam isiyat kaa vistaar karnaa or logon ko isse jodna he
 'lage Hath Lekhi also makes it clear that the author whose book she is talking about is not someone else but the same person who is considered loyal to the Congress
 seva kaa makasad kya hona chahie? seva kii manzil kya ho? jab ham kisi kii seva karte hai to use kya miltaa he? ham jisaki seva karte hai use khushi milti he
 Does his happiness make us happy too? When every action is reacted, why can't we get happiness from its happiness? So is the floor of service a joy? Can't we serve for happiness? What floor can be found without purpose? Does 'home-return' come under the purview of service? Is 'homecoming' a service without purpose? Does 'love-jihad' also come under the purview of service? If all this is service, is it not the purpose? Whatever it is, the question arises
 sawaal madar terresa kii maut ke saalon baad uthaa he
 In this country, everyone has the right to ask questions
 phir bhi ham thodaa sanyam baratate hai
 They ask questions but spare the past
 jahaan tak sawaalon kaa sawaal he, kejariwal kaa koi sani nahin
 But on this question he only says, 'mother Teresa was the Holy Spirit
 unhen to baksh do
 'questions can only be raised
 har sawaal par sawaal uthaae ja sakate hai
 i have nothing to say on Mother Teresa's service
 mohan bhagwat kii seva par mujhe kuch nahin kahana
 Nothing to say about the service of Mahatma Gandhi
 kisi tarah kii swayan-seva par bhi kuch nahin kahana

 The Delhi High Court has acquitted Madhya Pradesh BJP leader and minister Narottam Mishra in the matter of paid news
 dilli hai court ne chunaav ayog ke us aadesh ko radd kar diya jisamen mishra ko 2008 ke vidhansabha chunaav main ayogy ghoshit kiya gaya tha
 Apart from this, the court has also rejected the order dated 14 July 2017 of the Single Bench in which the Election Commission's decision was upheld
 court ne apane aadesh main kaha he ki unhen sunwaayee ke dauraan is bare memparyaapt saboot nahin mileki 2008 ke madhyapradesh vidhansabha chunaavon ke dauraan samachar patron main prakashit khabaren ped news thim
 On 10 October 2017, the court reserved its decision in the case
 court ne ab 7 maheene baad is maamle main faisla diya he
 Vivek Tankha, the complainant and lawyer who filed the petition, had said in his arguments that this is the largest paid news case in the country
 jaanch cameti ne mishra ke samarthan main prakashit 48 lekh main se 42 ped news paae the
 The lawyer said that the time the news was published, their language, date, headline all prove that the published news was paid news
 haalanki samachar patron ne khud yah maanate hue kaha ki unhone apni marji se yah khabaren prakashit kii thi, aise main mishra ke khilaaf ped news kaa maamla banataa hi nahin he
 Paid news is that which has been paid to publish
 paise koi bhi de saktaa he chaahe raajnneetik dal ho yaa phir ummidavaar kaa koi samarthak
 While hearing the petition of Narottam Mishra before the High Court, the Supreme Court stayed the decision of the Election Commission
 ayog ne narottam mishra ko 2008 ke vidhansabha chunaav main ped news ke maamle memmyogy ghoshit kiya tha
 Due to this, Narottam could not even cast a vote in the presidential election
 supreme court ne chunaav ayog ke faisle par roak lagane ke saath hi dilli hai court ko maamle kii jald sunwaayee ke nirdesh die the
 Subsequently, this directive was challenged in the double bench of the Delhi High Court
 dilli kii sard hawaaon or girti taapmaana ke bich vaayu pradooshan kaa str phir se bad rahaa he
 The accompanying smog has also made a comeback
 pashchimi vikshobh himalay or uttar pashchimi bharat kii ore bad rahaa he jisase un ilaakon main barfbaari bad sakati he
 Weak west disturbance will keep the weather clear in the plains but the wind speed may slow down and the haze is expected to subside
 pashchimi vikshon ke uttar bharat kii ore badhane ke saath-saath raat ke vakt taapmaana main giravat aa sakati he or maidani ilaake main phir se dhundh or nami bad sakati he
 With this result, pollution will again reach a dangerous level in Delhi
 dilli ke kuch ilaakon main pradooshan str 350 ke kareeb pahunch gaya, isamen PM 2
 The level of 5 reached 174 which is almost double the normal
 ab sthiti main kya dilli main od-evan formula khud-ba-khud lagu ho saktaa he
 Recently, the EPCA had said that this rule should be implemented automatically after the pollution level in Delhi increases
 visheshgyon kaa maananaa he ki dinsbar ke maah main majboot pashchimi vikshobh kaa asar rahegaa, jisase uttar bharat ke kuch ilaakon memberfabaari or barishabhi anumaan he
 Also, light fog has been forecast in Delhi on Wednesday and night temperatures may fall by up to 8 degrees
 mausam vibhaag ke ke mutabik aane vaale dinon main PM 2
 Level 5 may also increase
 dilli sarkaar kii isi ke maddemjar somvaar ko health adwijuri bhi jari kii thi
 It was stated that due to moisture, fog may increase in the capital and due to slow winds, dust may increase in particulate matter

 The case of police action, which took place on June 4 at Ramlila Maidan in Delhi, is scheduled to be heard in the Supreme Court today
 pichhali sunwaayee ke dauraan supreme court ne sakht rukh apanaate hue dilli police se kai sawaal kiye the
 The court asked why the FIA was not registered on the complaint of Baba Ramdev's supporters regarding excesses at Ramlila Maidan
 court ne is bare main dilli police se halafanama daayar kar safai dene ko kaha tha
 The Supreme Court said that it has not been clear from the previous affidavit what happened between June 1 and June 3
 court ke mutabik dividi photo or dastauez se safataur par pataa chalata he ki ramlila maidan main yogabhyas karavaaya ja rahaa tha
 Arvind Kejriwal, who joined the Anna Hazare side in the Lokpal draft joint committee, condemned the action taken against Baba Ramdev and his supporters at Ramlila Maidan, saying that lathi-charge on innocent people has proved that the government wants to indulge in corruption And whoever raises a voice against her, wants to crush it
 kejariwal ne maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantri kapil sibbal ko aade haath lete hue kaha ki agar hamane sarkaar ko dhokheybaaj, jhootha or sajishein rachane vaala kaha, to kya galat kaha
 Kejriwal said during Hazare's fast at Rajghat that the people of this country have been cheated in the form of corruption for so many years
 sarkaar pehle prastaavti lokapal ke daayre main pradhanmantri ko laane par sahmati jataa chuki thi, lekin baad main vah palat gai
 After this a CD regarding Shanti Bhushan was revealed, which was later found to be fake
 unhone sawaal kiya ki kya yah sab dhokhebaaji, jhooth or shadyantra nahin he
 In such a situation, when we told Baba Ramdev that the government can cheat, then what was wrong
 kejariwal ne kaha ki pichley dinon kendriya mantri kapil sibbal ne dhokhebaaji jaise shabdon par aapatti jataate hue kaha tha ki samaaj ke sadasyon ko is tarah kii bhashaa kaa prayog nahin karnaa chahie or yah bhi kaha tha ki samaaj ke sadsy saath den yaa na den ham 30 june tak lokapal vidheyak kaa masauda taiyaar kar lenge
 He said that the government will draft the Lokpal Bill without us, but it will not cover the conduct of the Prime Minister, the High Judiciary and mps under the purview of the proposed Lokpal
 naagarikta sanshodhan bill kaa shivasena rajyasabha main virodh karegi
 Sources are quoting that the Shiv Sena has told its mps in the Rajya Sabha to oppose the bill
 gaur karne vaali baat yah he ki loksabhaa main shivasena ne bill ke samarthan main voting kii thi
 After his support in the Lok Sabha, Shivsena MP Arvind Sawant said that he supported this bill for the national interest
 lekin iske baad shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare ne kaha ki unki kuch shankaaen hai, jab tak unki ye shankaaen dur nahin ho jaaengi, shivasena is bill ke saath nahin jaaegi
 Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut on Wednesday said, 'vote bank politics should not be done
 yah sahi nahin he
 Do not try to divide hindu-muslims again
 srilanka ke tamil hinduon ke bare main bhi is bill main kuch nahin he
 'at the same time he said,' Our doubts should be distance
 agar hamen santoshjanak jawaab nahin mila to loksabhaa main hamaara jo rukh tha, ab vah alag hoga
 'let me tell you, Shiv Sena MP Arvind Sawant said on Tuesday that the decision to vote in favor of the Citizenship Amendment Bill was taken in the national interest and the Common Minimum Program (CMP) made with the consent of his party, NCP and Congress is valid in Maharashtra
 
 saavant ne kaha, ‘yah (paksh main matdaan) raashtra ke hit main he
 "when he was asked about the CMP made with the consent of the three parties, he said," This is for Maharashtra
 'shivasena ne somvaar ko naagarikta sanshodhan vidheyak ke kuch pahaluon ko lekar chintaa prakat kii thi lekin usne use loksabhaa main paarit karaane main sarkaar kaa saath diya tha or vidheyak ke paksh main vot daalaa tha
 The Shiv Sena has an alliance with its ideological opponents Congress and NCP
 in donon dalon ne vidheyak ke viruddh vot daalaa tha
 Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray said on Tuesday that his party will not support the bill in the Rajya Sabha until there is clarity on the questions raised by his party Shiv Sena in the Lok Sabha

 Congress General Secretary Digvijay Singh says that for the post of Prime Minister, the party should now announce the name of Rahul Gandhi
 unhone kaha ki vidhansabha chunaavon main party kii haar kii samiksha hogi
 He spoke in detail to NDTV
 
 
 manoranjan bharti − vidhansabha chunaav main kya hua
 
 
 We have senior Congress leader Digvijay Singh to talk about this
 
 
 sar, main duvidha main hum, pehle main haar ke bare main puuchhuun yaa bete kii badi jeet ke bare main
 
 
 Digvijay - i said earlier that if there is a win, i will not come on TV and if there is a loss, i will come on TV and now when i have lost, i have come on TV in front of you
 jahaan tak party kaa sawaal he mujhe behad dukh he kyonki mujhe ummid nahin thi ki ye nattejey aaenge
 It seemed that the MLA of BJP is very angry with MP and its result will go in favor of us
 manoranjan bharti − 30 main se 10 mantri haare hai
 
 
 Digvijay - But it is the same person who has succeeded in taking the Congress towards resentment in the machine, and he has gone as far as you are talking about Jayawardhan and you have seen yourself for the last three months
 Was wandering from village to village
 to ye jeet bhi usee kii he
 i do not contribute to it
 maine to 1 din main 4-5 meeting hi vahaan kii thim
 i have not contributed to that
 to kehane kaa matlab meraa ye he ki jayavardhan ne puure 3 maheene main apni padhai puri karke 58 hazaar se jeet saktaa he to duusare ummidavaar kyon nahin jeet paae
 Manoranjan Bharti - Some people told me in Bhopal that the Congress leaders are migratory birds
 
 
 jo chunaav ke samay bhopal se jhil main aate hai or chunaav ke baad chale jate hai aap kya kahenge
 Digvijay - i would say that as far as Digvijay Singh is concerned, he does not have a ministerial post, neither is MP, nor is MLA, then he was given the responsibility of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Goa before UP
 vahiin main ghumta rahata hum or aap to jaanate hai manoranjan ji ki main dilli main rahanaa kabhi pasand nahin karata hum
 Manoranjan Bharti - Sir, do you think that your vote effect was overshadowed for Madhya Pradesh or for Madhya Pradesh Congress, when you said in a Thakur style that 10 years will not take any post, then Madhya Pradesh went out of hand
 digvijay − aisa nahin he us samay saare congress ke log yahi kah rahe thai ki maine hi haravaaya he maine hi durgati madhya pradesh kii kii he jo maine kaha ki 10 saal ham duusare jagah kaam kar ke dekhenge
 Manoranjan Bharti - After all, there was such an anti-incumbency, see the Guna Gwalior route, we also talked to people, could you not catch the mood of the people, whether you were the people or the Dividend House
 
 Digvijay Singh - i told you that the candidate who dropped the resentment against the BJP in the EVM won and the one who remained in the air remained in the air
 manoranjan bharti − ek taraf shivaraj singh chouhan ek taraf aap, jyotiraditya, kamalnath, bahuriyaan to kya bahut saare sir ho gaye the isliye log kanphyus ho gaye the? Digvijay Singh - It is being said that the Congress loses due to Modi
 manoranjan bharti − aapako haraane ke liye modi kii jarurat hi nahin he meraa ye maananaa he



 You have so much contraption in you, you see Jogi vs Charan Das in Chhattisgarh, you see Rajasthan Joshi vs Gehlot


 Despite Gehlot, Joshi is made chairman of the Chairmain committee, so what happened in Delhi, see Sheila Dixit says that the party is not with me Everyone knew where Modi's factor came from here, i believe the opposite
 
 
 digvijay singh − 
 
 
 That is why i am telling you that you have an assessment that the Congress has lost due to its own, Modi is not a factor
 
 
 manoranjan bharti − ji
 
 
 Yes
 
 
 yahi meraa kahana he
 
 
 Digvijay Singh- Okay manoranjan bharti − to isape aap tippanee nahin karenge kya
 
 digvijay singh − ab apana apana acesment he isamen main kya tippanee karun
 
 
 Manoranjan Bharati - Tell us what your assessment is
 
 Digvijay Singh - My assessment is that the candidate who has sent the bjp's resentment to the EVM machine, who has organized his election, won and the one who did not, he lost
 manoranjan bharti− to ab party main kuch thiking ho rahaa he madam ne aake bolaa kii pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar ye to doosraa baar ho rahaa he pichhali baar kaha tha is baar bhi kaha to kya karengi
 
 
 Is there any more option? 
 
 digvijay singh − ab is baat main to main itnaa hi kah saktaa hum ki jo aapane suna utana maine suna or sonia ji kya nirnay leti he unpar nirbhar karata he
 Manoranjan Bharti - Will Soniaji have to come forward herself? 
 
 digvijay singh − sonia aage to he hi
 
 
 He is next
 
 The Chairman is the same
 manoranjan bharti− to upaadhyaksh kab tak seekhenge meraa matlab
 
 
 Digvijay Singh - No, you don't have to learn that it is such that the general secretary has been in charge for the last four-five years
 pehle youth congress main ab vaais president hai party ke kaam kar hi rahe hai dekh hi rahe hai or logon se mil bhi rahe hai
 After going from place to place, they have second and third tier leadership


 They have made contact with all the leaders, where all the information is with them
 manoranjan bharti − kya koi tikat bantwaare main phalt he
 Digvijay Singh - The only fault is that the anti-committee report that came out of which tickets should be given at least 3 to 6 months in advance, if it is done then half the problem will be solved like this
 manoranjan bharti− log ab majaak karne lage he ki 2014 chhod dijie 2024 kii baat karte hai
 
 
 Digvijay Singh - You say that
 
 
 manoranjan bharti − nahin, log kehete he aapke elese bhi bolne lage hai umr ne twit kar diya kii rahul gandhi kii raily main kam bheed chintaa kaa vishay he sharad pavaar ne kah diya kii jhola chhap log party main haaavee ho chuke hai aap or ham jaanate he ki kidar ishaara he aapke kya lagata he colective major kya he kya sharad pavaar aapaki baat se sahamat hai
 
 
 
 digvijay singh − nahin, meri baat nahin ho pai sharad pavaar ji se


 sharad pavaar ji to sarkaar main he or agar sarkaar main rahete hue unhone kahin mahasoos kiya he ki kahin koi kami rahi ho unako apni baat kehani chahie cabinet main mananeey pradhanmantri ji se
 
 manoranjan bharti − dilli main aapako andaja tha kii shila dikshit itani buree tarah se haarengi
 
 
 Digvijay Singh - No, i had no idea
 
 
 manoranjan bharti − to aapako lagata he ki aam aadmi party ek phenomenon ban ke ubhari he
 
 
 Digvijay Singh - i consider this to be a good sign and when Arvind Kejriwal ji was doing the agitation, i had said in total that you should dare come to the political arena, i can come to electoral politics and they came to fruition
 i congratulate them manoranjan bharti − sar, pavaar ne kaha ki dilli bahut pemprd state he sab kuch dilli ko chahie ames bhi chahie koi games bhi ho wo bhi chahie
 
 stadium bhi chahie 


 sasta pani bhi chahie 
 
 sasta bijli bhi chahie to unka kahana he ki kejariwal jo bade vaade kar rahe he wo use puraa nahin kar paaenge Digvijay Singh - Now Kejriwal will be able to do it only after that
 
 
 manoranjan bharti − kya aapako lagata he ki dobaaraa chunaav hota he to shila dikshit ko dobaaraa khadaa hona chahie itani badi haar ke baad
 
 
 Digvijay Singh - This party will decide
 
 
 manoranjan bharti − chhattisgarh aapane kaha tha mujhe ek intervyuu main ki chhattisgarh aapke dil ke bahut kareeb he
 
 vahaan kya hua jitate jitate haar kaise gaye
 
 
 Digvijay Singh - If you look at voting percentage
 
 
 manoranjan bharti − to badi he
 
 
 Digvijay Singh - is equal
 
 
 manoranjan bharti − baraabar he thodaa sa antar he
 
 
 Digvijay Singh - The difference is not even 41–41, both have


 now there is a shortage on some seats
 manoranjan bharti − rajasthan to gaya
 
 
 Digvijay Singh - We have lost a lot in Rajasthan
 
 
 manoranjan bharti − to ab kya abhi vichaar ho rahaa he
 
 party main kuch chintaa he kuch ye he ki 2014 main kya hoga modi wave to log kehete hi hai
 
 
 Digvijay Singh - Now churning is happening, but you yourself are saying that there was no Modi wave
 
 
 manoranjan bharti − main to aapke andruni kalah ke vajah se kaha ki aapako haraane ke liye kisi modi kii jarurat nahin he lekin lok sabha chunaav main to modi wave hoga naa
 
 
 Digvijay Singh - There is no wave


 Modi is nobody but only a good publicity system is there with him who is doing the wind


 i do not think there is any effect
 
 
 manoranjan bharti − 127 saal puraani party ke paas nahin he kya
 
 
 Digvijay Singh - What
 
 
 manoranjan bharti − prachaar tantra
 
 
 Digvijay Singh - We are getting a little weak in the publicity system

 Digvijay Singh - i am who i am
 
 
 manoranjan bharti − acha ek andhra ke sansad ne no confidence moshan move kar diya he ab kya hoga loksabhaa main agar no confidence moshan aa gaya to
 
 
 Digvijay Singh - Negotiations are going on and it is being said that you should withdraw this quickly
 
 
 manoranjan bharti− ek antim sawaal madam ne kaha ki pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar ghoshit karenge


 kya rahul gandhi hi honge koi or to he nahin
 
 
 Digvijay Singh - Now it depends on the Madam


 Depends on the Congress President


 But the public sentiment of the general Congress is that Rahul Gandhi should come to the field
 manoranjan bharti − aapkaa bahut bahut dhanyavad

 lekin use kaabo main karte hi police waalon ne us par laat-ghunse-thappad barasaane shuru kar die, or phir use ghasitate hue aspataal se baahar laae, or ek gaadi main ladakar kotwali bhej diya
 On the other hand, according to the doctor RP Tripathi, who has been accused by Sugriva, no such incident has happened, and he claims that due to congestion in the OPD, he asked all the patients to stay in line and wait for their turn
 
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki vah dopaher 12 baje tak opidi main sabhi marijon ko dekhne ke baad hi aspataal se laute hai

 Pakistan is also a friend of China and Pakistan should also get an equal chance by not discriminating against it
 unhone kaha ki is mudde par china kii apni sthiti he or wo sabhi ke saamne spasht he
 Speaking on the border dispute between India and China, Jiangwu said that this is a complex issue and should be resolved by mutual coordination between the two countries
 unhone kaha ki agar bharat is disha main koi behatar pahal karata he to china bhi ise aage badhaane ke liye samahamat he

 So is it necessary to be a member of RSS to love the country? In the statement to the press, the two issues he has raised in his agenda as president, also hold a special place in the Hinduist ideology of Indian history
 inamen se ek he mahabharat or ramayana jaise granthon kii aitihaasikta ko sabit karnaa, or unase judi pramukh ghatnaon, tarikhon ko pramanit karnaa

 Many scholars have considered this argument of Sukhthankar
 mul granth kii rachana ke baad isamen or bhi kai anya jaankariyon or rachanaaon ko shaamil kiya gaya
 New texts added to the original text are not mentioned because it makes it more difficult to find the date of the creation of the original book

 Some people may be interested in knowing the dates of their creation, but it is certain that most historians will be more interested in seeing and understanding history in a more comprehensive perspective, which will include some such studies: different parts of the subcontinent

 This is because they have little knowledge of what is the Marxist view in history
 isliye ve iske mahatv ko bhi nahin samaj pate
 To him, Marxist means only those people who oppose the Hinduist ideology
 iske parinamswaroop adhiktar itihaaskaar ekaek khud par marxvaadi kaa thappa laga pate hai
 In the previous NDA government, then HRD minister Murali Manohar Joshi had attacked the historians directly
 yah hamalaa do tarah ke itihaas lekhan par kiya gaya tha
 The first attack was on the subject matter of NCERT school books before 1999 and the second was an attempt to stop the publication of some projects such as the "towards Freedom Project" of the ICHR
 vartmaan maanav sansaadhan mantri, durbhaagya se jinhen schuli str se aage ke shaikshanik or shodh kii jaankaree nahin he, kii ore se mil rahe sanketon se lagata he ki ve bhi vahi karne vaali hai jiske liye unhen niyukt kiya gaya he: bijepi kii vichaardhaara vaale itihaaskaaron ko phir se mauka dena, jo khud bhi iske liye qamar kas ke taiyaar ho chuke hai
 This pattern is clearly understood
 vyavsaayik sanghathanon kii siforeeshon ko darkinar karke peshewar vichaaron ko gupt sanketon main badla ja rahaa he
 This has also happened in an important area like the judiciary
 khabar to yah bhi he ki isiechaaar ne adhyaksh pad ke liye kuch naamon kii suchi maanav sansaadhan mantralay ko bheji thi
 The list also named those historians who helped make the ICHR a research institute
 lekin shaayad us suchi ko mantralay main soch-samajhakar thikaane laga diya gaya
 After this, an unknown name came out suddenly and that person also became the president of the institution
 agar aisa hi chalata rahaa to yah andhere dinon kaa sanket he
 (romila Thapar is an ancient Indian historian) rohit patel, 24 varsh, navonmeshi kisaan, dedla, dhar, madhya pradeshkisaanon ke parivaar main paidaa hone ke chalate rohit patel ko chaatr se kisaan banane main pareshaani nahin hui
 But this truth definitely bothered that there is not much money in the harvest
 unke 20 acre ke khet main pyaaj parivaar kii mukhya fasal hua karti thi
 Rohit felt that the middleman takes away all the profits
 kisaan keemat chadhgaye tak fasal rakh bhi nahin sakate
 Rohit understood that onion is sold at the time of harvest from Rs 1 kg to Rs 30-40 per kg immediately after monsoon
 iskaa phayda uthaane main sabase bada roda thah bhandaaran suvidha kaa abhaav
 He devised an idea and made a drum using wires to store onions in it
 ghaataa kam hua par 20 fisadi ab bhi tha
 Ultimately, the traditional wisdom worked
 ve bataate hai, "dada kaha karte the ki pyaaj ko hawa lagane kii jarurat he, or sadi pyaaj fouran dher se alag kar dena chahie, varna vah puure dher ko nuksaan pahunchaayegi
 "without this traditional wisdom, Rohit designed a low cost alternative technology
" unhone jameen se kareeb ek foot kii oonchai par lohe kii ek jaali laga di
 Believed to be useless, put the discarded drums or casks on it and put a powerful exhaust fan on them
 fain chalane par hawa pipon se guzarati or puure kamare main fail jaati
 In this process, the onion also got wind
 pankhe ko garmi kii raaton main 5-6 ghante or sardiyon main din main itane hi der chalaane kii jarurat padati he
 This technology helped Rohit reduce his losses by 5 per cent, which used to be 30 per cent earlier when he stored his onions directly on the floor
 10 -10 foot ke kamare main 6 ton tak pyaaj jamaa karke rakhi ja sakati he
 Look at the cost of this technology in it: Rs 5,000
 bijli kaa bilah 600-700 ru
 Month
 rohit ab indore kii choithram mandi main krishi upajon kaa vyapaar karte hai
 They say, "onion costs around Rs

 kilo padati he
 If you do not get a good price, it becomes a profession of losses
 trading behatar vikalp he
 "baat Address": Over 700 farmers have adopted Patel's introduced onion storage technology
 Rohit's first model for onion storage was adopted by all farmers in the area

 Bahujan Samaj Party President Mayawati tried the formula of alliance with different regional parties in different states of the country to win the political battle of Lok Sabha elections 2019, but this effort failed completely
 uttar pradesh se baahar kisi or rajya main basapa kuch khaas asar nahin dikhaa saki he
 As a result, the BSP has broken alliances one by one
 isaki shuruyaat upi main sapa ke saath hui or ab chhattisgarh main ajit jogi kii party se basapa ne gathbandhan khatm kar liya he
 Baspamayavati, who was separated from the SP in UP, allied with the SP, forgetting the 24-year-old rivalry to save his political existence in the country's largest state UP and to stop the victory chariot of Narendra Modi
 akhilesh-mayawati ne jamkar soobe main reliyaan kii, lekin nattejey aae to sapa-basapa ke saare sameekaran dhwast ho gaye
 In Modi's severe wave, the SP-BSP alliance could win only 15 seats, out of which BSP has got 10 and SP has got 5 seats
 jabaki 2014 main basapa ko ek bhi seat nahin mili thi
 Desperate by the defeat, Mayawati had blown all the tears on the SP and said that she could not get the results she expected after the alliance
 aise main soobe ke upachunaav main basapa akele chunaav ladegi
 Whereas earlier, Mayawati was describing this alliance as voter's alliance
 haryana main mayawati ne choda saini kaa sathupi ke baad basapa ne haryana main bhi apane gathbandhan saathi loktantr suraksha party (elespi) se naata tod liya he
 Mayawati had an electoral tie-up with LSP President Rajkumar Saini
 gathbandhan ke tahat haryana kii 10 siton main se 8 par basapa ne apane pratyaashee utaare the or elespi ne 2 siton par chunaav ladaa tha
 In the Modi wave, both the parties have suffered badly
 vidhansabha ke liye tay hua tha ye formulalokasabhaa chunaavon se pehle hue basapa-elespi gathbandhan main 55-35 kaa formula vidhansabha chunaavon ke liye tay kiya gaya tha
 The BSP was supposed to contest 55 and the LSP 35, but Mayawati has pulled back after the Lok Sabha election results
 haalanki, mayawati ne pehle haryana main indian neshnal lokdal ke saath gathbandhan kiya tha, lekin inelo kii paariwarik tut kaa hawala dekar basapa ne yah gathbandhan todaa or rajkumaar saini kii party elespi ke saath dosti kaa haath badhaayaa or ab use khatm kar diya
 In Chhattisgarh, the BSP broke the friendship with Jogi, the impact of the crushing defeat in the Lok Sabha elections is also seen in Chhattisgarh
 chhattisgarh main purv mukhyamantri ajit jogi kii party janata congress chhattisgarh ke saath basapa ne gathbandhan tod diya he
 Now both parties will contest separately in the upcoming body and panchayat elections
 aise main party supremeo mayawati ne basapa ke apane cader vot ko majboot karne ke nirdesh die hai
 Ajit Jogi's party formed an alliance with the BSP in September before the Chhattisgarh assembly elections 2018
 is chunaav main pradesh kii kul 90 main se 35 siton par basapa or 55 siton par gathbandhan main ajit jogi kii party ne chunaav ladaa tha
 The coalition of the two had got seven seats, two of which were BSP
 iske baad loksabhaa chunaav main sabhi 11 siton par basapa ne akele chunaav ladaa, lekin safalataa nahin mili
 After this, both have now parted ways

 iske kai kaaran hai jaise ki partner kii kami, vidhwaa ho janaa, rajonivritti se sambandhit lakshan, saathi kaa kharaab swasthya or rishte se sambandhit mudde
 According to a study published in 'menopause: The Journal of the North American Menopause Society', the interest of women who have regular physical relationships begins to decrease with age and that of women enjoying physical relationships after menopause The number is even less
 is adhyayan main rajonivritti ke baad mahilaon main is baat kaa nirikshan kiya gaya ki kis tarah se rishton main ghanishthata, swasthya or manovaigyanik kaarak in mahilaon main yon antarangta ko prabhavit karti he
 Stephanie Fubion, Medical Director of the North American Menopause Society, said, "sexual health challenges are common in women as they age, and partners also play a major factor in women's sexual activity and satisfaction
" "fubian ne aage kaha, "iske alaava rajonivritti sambandhi samasyaayein jaise ki sharir ke andruni hisse main suukhaapan or sambandh banane ke dauraan dard, inaki pahchaan bhi yon gatividhi ko prabhavit karne vaale karkon ke rup main kii gai he
 Despite the availability of effective medical facilities, few women provide treatment related to them
 "shodhakartaaon ne adhyayan kiya ki kaise or kyon rajonivritti ke dauraan or iske baad mahilaon main shaareerik sambandh main ruchi ghatane lagati he
 a number of biological factors were researched for the study such as sudden body temperature rise, sleep deprivation, dryness on the inside of the body and pain during sexual relationships

 At that time it was said by the government that a fund was being set up 'to increase the enthusiasm of the diaspora (nris) and citizens of Indian origin (pios) for contributing to the cleanliness and conservation of the holy Ganges'
 is nek makasad ke liye nijee taur par daankartaaon, privet sector or saarvajanik kshetra ke upakramon (psus) se bhi bad chadh kar yogadan dene ke liye apil kii gai
 The contribution of overseas Indians in 'clean Ganga Fund' is just 0

 According to the reply, the attitude of nris and pios remained cold in this direction
 teen saal main unhone sirf 25 lakh rupee kaa yogadan diya
 The total contribution to this fund is only 0
 10% hi baithta he
 If you look at the chart of contribution of nris in every month in 2018, then there was no pie from nris in any month except July

 Both of them want that they do not do anything that will make the front person feel bad because this is the time which is remembered throughout the life
 aise main koshish kerani chahie aap inamen se koi bhi galati na kar baithen:1
 Don't expect too much
 Everybody wants to make a honeymoon special, but don't expect too much from your partner
 ho saktaa he use kisi se ghulne-milane main vakt lagata ho
 So do not raise your expectations too much
 2
 Stay the same as you are, on the first night after marriage, a variety of books are available in the market
 unhen padhakar khud ko uske anusaar dhaalane kii jarurat nahin he
 Nor needs to do as your friends say
 aap jaise hai usee tarah rahiye
 This is the first time to lay the foundation for a lifetime and nothing should be artificial in this
 3
 No need to be rash
 Too much rash can spoil your impression
 dhiraj se kaam len or apane partner ko bhi puraa spes den
 Talk to each other as much as possible and try to make mutual understanding
 4
 Do not try to run your own, this moment belongs to both of you
 aise main ye dhyaan rakhen ki agar aap sirf apni hi chalaate rahengeto aapkaa partner asahaj mahasoos kar saktaa he
 Whatever is the matter, it is very important for both of you to have your consent
 5
 Avoid removing the deficiency, do not forget the work
 agar aasapane partner se santusht nahin haiyaa phir aapako koi duusari shikaayat he to use jaahir karne kaa ye sahi samay nahin he
 You can do these things even after some time
 tab tak ap done ke bich sambandh majboot bhi ho jaaenge or aap donon ek-duusare ko samajhane bhi lagenge

 President said - Rights and duties are two sides of the same coin, President Ramnath Kovind said that it is our supreme law which keeps guiding us
 hamane vishwa ke kai samvidhan main uplabdh uttam niyamon ko apanaaya he
 Our constitution is the constitution of the people of India for the people of India, created by the people of India
 yah ek rashtriya dastavej he
 The President further said that our Constitution beats the heart of Indian democracy
 is jeevantta ko banaae rakhane ke liye sanshodhano kaa bhi praavdhaan kiya gaya
 The election of 78 women mps in the 17th Lok Sabha is a proud achievement of our democracy
 yah ek mahatvapurn raajnneetik or saamaajik parivartan he
 President Kovind further spoke of fundamental duties, saying that rights and duties are two sides of the same coin
 jarurat is baat kii he ki ham sab apane kartavyon ko nibhaakar aisi sthit utpann karen jahaan adhikaron kaa prabhavi sangrakshan ho sake
 Developing the spirit of humanism is also a fundamental duty of the citizens
 vishwa kii bhishantam gas traasadee ke 26 varsh biit jane ke baavjood gas peediton kaa dard samaapt nahin hua he or aaj bhi gas ke prabhaav ke chalate saikadon bachche aise hai jo maansik rup se viklang hai or anya bimariyon se jujh rahe hai
 Khushi, who lives in a gas-affected colony, is among such girls whose name is Khushi, but she is still sad due to gas-borne diseases
 khushi ko janmajaat viklaangata ke chalate chalane main dikkat he or vah kisi sahare ke bina chal bhi nahin sakati he
 Khushi's mother Tulika Verma daily takes her to the Chingari Trust Rehabilitation Center, run by an NGO, located in Berasia Road, for treatment
 punarvaas kendra ke vishesh prashikshak tarik ahamed ne bhashaa ko bataaya ki khushi bhale hi shaareerik rup se viklang he lekin uski yaaddaasht gajab kii tej he or vah computer main bhi vishesh rup se nipun he
 Ahmed said that Khushi's father Sanjay Verma is affected by the gas and he has also received compensation for this
 khushi bade hokar vaigyanik bananaa chaahati he
 Similarly, Devesh Kumar, the ten-year-old son of Mathura Prasad Raikwar, who lives in Ramnagar, a gas-affected township, is also mentally challenged and is also brought to this center for treatment daily
 ahamed ne bataaya ki devesh ke pita bhi gas peedit hai
 He told that Devesh remembers poems but forgets shortly after
 unhone bataaya ki devesh bada hokar athlete bananaa chahta he, vah kai daud pratiyagitaaon main padak bhi jeet chukaa he
 Ayan Mohammad, six-year-old son of Anees Ahmed, who lives in Ward 11, is also mentally challenged

 Similarly, nine-year-old Armaan Mian is also mentally challenged and has a brain disease
 armaan ke pita jahangirabad main rahete hai or do
 On the night of December 3, 2004, he was also a victim of gas
 armaan sahit ukt sabhi bachche ilaaj ke liye roj chingaari punarvaas kendra pahunchate hai
 Rashida B, manager trustee of Chingari Trust, said that the percentage of mentally challenged and many other types of disabilities and diseases in the gas affected area is ten times more than normal
 rashida bi ne bataaya ki punarvaas kendra main sau se adhik vibhinn bimariyon kaa shikaar bachche roj aa rahe hai
 He informed that these children are being adequately treated at the center and efforts are being made to make them live a normal life
 rashida ne bataaya ki kisi bhi bachche ke ilaaj se pehle is baat kii puri jaankaree lee jaati he ki unke abhibhavak gas peedit hai yaa nahin kyonki aise bacchon se ilaaj ke liye kisi prakaar kaa shulk nahin liya jaataa he
 Rashida b told that after the start of this center in the year 2006, 24 children suffering from various diseases have been operated
 ek gaiyr sarkari swanyasevi sanghathan sambhaavna trust ke shishu rog visheshgy da
 Mohammad Wasim said that children born in gas-affected areas are experiencing mental disabilities and brain diseases

 a large number of school children are waiting for Sindhu

 Sindhu is the first Indian woman to win a silver medal in the Olympics
 rahul gandhi kii congress apane kiye ko nahin bhunaa paati or narendra modi ke kahe par voton kaa ambara lag jaataa he
 That is why in the Delhi where the Congress touched all aspects of development during its 15 consecutive years of tenure, sometimes Kejriwal's slogan of corruption or Modi's development slogan makes the Congress a silent spectator
 isi haal main loksabhaa chunaav kii karaari haar ke baad 13 janvari ko congress kaarysmiti kii duusari baithak chal rahi thi, tabhi party mukhyalay 24 akbar road ke saamne se ek skool bas gujri
 The students sitting in the bus, showing their fingers towards the Congress office, said: "no one will vote for you now
" ’’vidambnaa yah he ki thik usee vakt congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi kaarysmiti ke sadasyon se kah rahe the ki ve congress or uski vichaardhaara kii taraf votaron ko aakarshith karne ke tareeke khojein
 Those students of the school must have been on his mind, because he wanted the Congress to give due attention to the aspirations of the young, urban Indians
 lekin rahul ke liye aage kaa rasta katai aasaan nahin he, kyonki party main jaan foonkane kii unki yojana kii kamyaabi is baat par tiki he ki unamem party diggajon se apni yojana ko manavaa lene kaa kitna jajba or kaabiliyat he
 In an attempt to bring about the "unimaginable reforms" he promised after the 2013 Delhi Assembly elections, Rahul wants to make some amendments to the party constitution to make changes to the structure of the organization
 misaal ke liye, aantarik loktantr ko majboot banane ke liye ve theth block congress sadasyon ko lekar ek matadaata mandal bananaa chaahate hai
 They will also have the right to speak in the election of state presidents
 rajyon main nirnay prakriya philhal mukhyamantri or teen-chaar mantriyon ke haathon main kaid he
 Rahul wants the grassroots worker to be heard in the decisions by decentralizing it
 ek or prastaav yah he ki online sadsyta kii ijaajat den or sakriy sadsyta kii vyavastha dobaaraa lagu karen
 Also the membership fee will be reduced to the current Rs
 se badha diya jaae, taaki farji sadsy banane vaale netaa baj aaen or party kaa kuch bhala ho
 Nobody has reservations about these ideas in principle
 lekin party adhyaksh sonia gandhi sahit kai varisht netaa vikendrikaran kii prakriya ko sanvaidhanik manjuuri dene kii baat ko abhi tak gale nahin utaar paae hai
 According to him, the work of empowering the lower level workers should be at the level of thought and emotion, but the implementation of this in the structure of the institution can result in a split in the party
 party ke ek mahasachiv kehete hai, ‘‘in vichaaron main nayaa kya he? congress ko duusari partiyon ke nakshe-kadam par chalakar nahin, balki khud apane dam-kham ke boote par apana rasta bananaa hoga
 When Rahul Gandhi said that the Congress will take a lesson from the Aam Aadmi Party, it was his horrific mistake
 ’’ duusari ore congress mahasachiv digvijay singh kehete hai, ‘‘hamaare sanghathan ke chunaav niyamit rup se hote hai or congress adhyaksh tathaa upaadhyaksh koi bhi faisla lene se pehle hameshaa party ke varisht netaaon se charchaa karte hai
 But Rahul Gandhi wants more democracy and decentralization
 ’’ kai yuva netaaon kii raay main, rahul ko ashanka he ki jaise hi ve amulchul badlaavon ke saath aage badhenge, vaise hi unhen party ke diggajon kii jabardast pratikriya kaa saamana karnaa padegaa, isiilie ve raajnneeti se unke thakkar chur hone kaa intjaar kar rahe hai
 a close aide of the party vice-president says, "it is a long process and to be honest, we have only 50 per cent confidence in the success of this experiment
" kisi bhi str par agar koi gadabad hui to thikra rahul ke sir par hi phutegaa
 "however, the meeting of the Congress Working Committee lasted for about four and a half hours and the indication was that Rahul's sitting on the top post of the party is now just a formality
 kyonki baithak main jin baton kii charchaa hui, ve sabhi us becoground paper ke ird-gird gumti thim, jo congress kaaryakartaaon ke saath rahul ke vichaar-vimarshon par yaa bhoomi adhigrahan or kisaanon ke adhikaron sareekhe unke pasandida muddon par aadhaarit tha
 a young MP told India Today, "consider my point, Rahul Gandhi will become Congress President by July
 ’’ digvijay singh ke mutabik, rahul agar jaldi nahin to aktubar tak to adhyaksh ban hi jaaenge
 In the last six months, the Congress vice-president met more than 400 Congress workers at his bungalow and wanted to know from most what to do to revive the party
 ve unase saat-aath logon ke samoohon main mili
 One hour before the meeting, he was given a chance to scrutinize the suggestions received in the previous meetings and in addition to his own opinion, his views were also sought on them
 24 disambar ko unhone akhil bhartiya congress cameti (eisisi) ke mahasachivon ke saath ek marathon baithak kii or unhen nirdesh die ki ve party kaaryakartaaon ke saath unke vichaar-manthan ke baad taiyaar becoground paper par jila or block str par feedback hasil karen or do maheenon ke bheetar report pesh karen
 Four days later, on the basis of this paper, Sonia Gandhi sent a letter to the state presidents, saying that the state Congress Committee (PCC) would hold discussions in small groups at key state and district levels about ideology, organizational reforms and the way forward
 Gather ideas in pisisi pramukhon ko apni report 28 farvari tak bhejni he, taaki march main sambhavit ‘‘agle eisisi satr main charchaa or anumodanya’’ ke liye karrwai ke agenda ko antim rup diya ja sake
 Rahul Khema dismisses the suspicions of the seniors and says that the real details of his action plan should be seen
 rahul ke ek kareebi sahyogi kehete hai, ‘‘ham vikendrikaran kii baat kar rahe hai, iskaa matlab he ki satta mahasachivon, mukhyamantriyon yaa pisisi pramukhon ke haathon main kendrit nahin rahegi
 But to whom are we giving power? First, we have to build and educate party workers who exercise power responsibly
 yahi sabase badi chunauti he
 That is why we are focusing on the membership process and creating electorates
 ’’congress saansad jyotiraditya sindhiya yah kehete hue rahul ke bachaav main kud padate hai ki party ke punarnirmaan ko lekar rahul gandhi kii drushti bilkul saaf he
 He says, "they understand the problems very well, they also have a clear strategy, in the next few months you will see it unfold and execute
" ’’sanghathanaatmak sudhaaron ke alaava sarkaar ko gherne main apanaai gai ranneeti par bhi rahul kii chhap dikhaai di
 The Working Committee decided to bring an ordinance on land acquisition and coal mines to counter the Narendra Modi government, weaken the minimum support price for farmers and welfare schemes like MNREGA, Food Security Act, Forest Rights Act and self-help Group Institutions
 There will be nationwide protests against
 iske fouran baad party netaa jairam ramesh ne jameen adhigrahan adhyadesh ko lekar modi sarkaar ke upar tikhaa hamalaa bol diya
 The Congress says that the ordinance implemented by the Modi government has taken away from farmers the rights that the UPA 2 government gave them in 2013 by enacting land acquisition, restoration and rehabilitation laws
 sadakon par andolan or virodh pradarshan congress kii ranneeti kaa hissaa honge, yah yuva congress ke adhyaksh ke chayan se bhi jaahir he
 According to a close aide of Rahul, Punjab MLA Amarinder Singh Raja Brar has been made the head of the youth wing due to his ability to fight on the streets and speech-art
 lekin congress ke varisht netaa in virodh pradarshnon kii aalochana kar rahe hai
 He says that Rahul has tried all this before but nothing has been achieved
 congress kaarysmiti ke ek sadsy kehete hai, ‘‘aap shahari yuvaaon ko rijhaanaa chaahate hai or abhi bhi samaajwaad or kisaanon ke adhikaron kii rat main fanse hue hai
 There is also a criticism that Rahul's focus on issues dominated by ngos has led to an economic crisis for the party
 ek mahasachiv kehete hai, ‘‘rahul ke gaiyr-siyaasi salaahkaar, jo yaa to saamaajik sudhaaron ke mahaan vichaaron se ot-prot academik hai yaa saamaajik kaaryakarta, na keval vot jutaney main naakaam rahe balki unhone korporate jagat ko bhi party se dur dhakel diya he
 We are facing a grave crisis
 ’’ charchaa he ki party bainkon ke overdraft par baari-bharkam byaaj adaa kar rahi he
 However, Rahul's supporters say that he is not stubborn in his views and is ready to improve
 saboot ke taur par ve bataate hai ki unke dwaara shuru kii gai yuva congress kii chunaav prakriya kii naakaami ko unhone kabool kiya tha
 However, a big question mark still remains on Rahul's working style
 unke vichaar-vimarsh ke dauraan ek ahm baat yah ubharkar ai thi ki unhen party kaaryakartaaon or media se zyada milanaa-julna chahie or soshal media ke jariye apni baat sidhe panhuchani chahie
 Rahul may not be directly active but the party has become so active on social media for the first time in its history
 party saral bhashaa or tikhe tewaron ke saath modi sarkaar ke kisi bhi vivaadit faisle par tanj kasne se peeche nahin hat rahi he
 Not only this, Congress has hired professional people for beautiful and accurate use of cartoons and graphics
 yah badlaav rahul kii daliton ke ghar jane vaali puraani ranneeti kaa ek nayaa adhyay jaisaa lagata he
 But many problems still persist
 congress upaadhyaksh ke uplabdh hone ke mudde par party netaaon kii raay banty hui he
 Some leaders say that it has become very easy to take the time to meet them and now they are also more patient
 inamen aise netaa bhi shaamil hai jinke bare main unki raay acchhee nahin maani jaati
 But it is still very difficult for many other leaders to get hold of him
 asal main, 5 janvari ko jab nae chune gaye yuva congress adhyaksh apana padbhaar sambhaal rahe the, tab rahul yuva congress mukhyalay se nadaarad the
 Says a senior leader, "youth Congress workers gathered at the event
 unase judye kaa unke liye yahi mauka tha
 Even he was not present in the Congress's Foundation Day celebrations
 isse kaaryakartaaon main galat sanket jaataa he
 "both the anti-rahul and pro-rahul camps have the same opinion on one issue - where to start the turnaround of the party
 rahul dwaara taiyaar becoground paper saaf-saaf kahata he ki party main jaan foonkane kaa kaam rajyon se shuru hoga
 This is Rahul's biggest challenge
 may 2014 ke baad se congress chaar rajyon main satta ganvaa chuki he
 Elections are going to be held in two states - Delhi and Bihar - this year and both have very little chance of winning the party
 party ke bheetar loktantr ko majboot banane kii charchaaon ke bich sonia gandhi ne teen rajyon-assam, orissa or tripura-main nae adhyakshon kii niyukti kar di, baavjood iske ki kuch hi maheenon main sanghathan ke chunaav hone vaale hai
 All three appointments have been done by Rahul's choice
 ye niyuktiyaan haalanki kisi sanghathanaatmak punargathan ke iraade se nahin kii gai hai
 In Assam, Anjan Dutta has been made the chairman because he can be celebrated after being deprived of the minister's post for a long time and weakening the disgruntled activities of former Health and Education Minister Hemant Biswa Sarma
 orissa main prasad harichandan ko isliye kaman saunpi gai, kyonki unke purvavarti jayadev jena ke khilaaf asantosh kii aag sulag rahi thi

 padosi punjab main bhi party purv mukhyamantri amarinder singh or pisisi pramukh pratap singh bajva ke do khemon main banty hui he
 It is said that Amarinder himself is planning to launch his own party and has got the support of senior leader Manish Tiwari
 haalanki amarinder ne jis tarah dilli main sonia or rahul se milakar party ke prati apni patibaddhta jataai he, usase in atakalon par kuch had tak viraam jarur laga he
 One of the problems of the party is that it does not have organizational structure in many states

 Rahul's massive metamorphosis scheme aims to bring democracy within the party
 unhone khud mana he ki yuva congress ko loktantric banane kaa unka prayog naakaam ho chukaa he
 The question is, will they be able to succeed in the mission of democratizing the parent party? He should also delve into the history of the party where on the one hand the people went after the charisma of leaders like Gandhi and Nehru, on the other hand it was not too late to change Indira after the public outrage

 Nitish while addressing the benefits of alcohol ban, Nitish enumerated the benefits of change in the society after prohibition in Kumar Kumar Bihar
 unhone kaha ki bihar main sharabbandi kaa sidhaa asar aparaadh ke aankadon par padaa he
 Due to alcoholism, road accidents have fallen by about 30 percent
 nitish kumaar kii maane to bihar main sharabbandi ke baad se aparaadh kii ghatnaon main bhi kaaphi kami ai he
 Demand for ban on sale of liquor in UP
 Bihar Chief Minister said that in Uttar Pradesh also the first ban should be made
 unhone kaha ki upi desh main ek bada rajya he or yahaan sharaab kii khapat bhi zyada he, nitish ne kaha ki sharabbandi kaa faisla samaaj ke hit main he, isse garibon main bachat kii takat badhegi

 saath hi unhone kaha ki agar akhilesh sarkaar sharabbandi ke phaayde dekhnaa chaahate hai to ek team ko bihar daure par bhejein

 Chinese technology giant Xiaomi is preparing to launch its first dual camera smartphone in India
 company ke mutabik 5 sitambar ko dilli ke ek event main ise pesh kiya jayega
 In China, the company has also launched two-camera smartphones before, but this will be the first for India
 shaomi ke vaais president or india head manu kumaar jain ne twit ke jariye yejankaree di he
 However, he has not told which phone is being launched on this day
 aapako bataa den ki haal hi main china dual camera vaala bajet smartphone Mi 5X launch hua he or ummid he ki bharat main ise launch kiya ja saktaa he
 According to the tweet, it will be launched globally
 yani agar Mi 5X launch hota he to ise global launch nahin kaha ja saktaa, kyonki ise pehle hi china main launch kar diya gaya he
 Therefore, it is possible that the company is preparing to introduce a new smartphone which has not been launched in China at the moment
 haal hi main Mi Mix 2 ke kathith spacifications li hue hai, isliye kuch exparts kaa maananaa he ki shaomi Mi Mix 2 launch kar sakati he
 It is worth noting that Xiaomi's flagship smartphone ie Mi 6 also has a dual camera
 lekin ise bharat main nahin launch kiya jayega
 Xiaomi is working with Google on a particular stock Android
 aisa reports main bataaya ja rahaa he or philhal aadhikarik nahin he
 That is, the company can launch Mi 5X with Android One platform in India

 Movie Review Bioscopewala: Kahani Wahi, Packaging Nayi, Danny's tremendous style
 The weak plot: The plot of the film's story is good, but the way the story moves forward is disappointing
 film kaa screenple kaaphi hilaa dula he or bahut hi lambii kahani he, jise achche tareeke se edit kiya jaataa to film or bhi behatar ho sakati thi
 Attempts have been made to show the preparation of superheroes many times, due to which boredom also occurs
 gaanon ko bhi achche dhang se nahin piroyaa gaya he
 This is Harshvardhan Kapoor's second film, but he does not appear to be able to attract in any way
 haalanki unhone prayaas kaaphi acha kiya he jo kaabile tarif he
 Vikramaditya Motwani can also be called the weakest film ever made
 film kaa trailor kaaphi dilachasp tha or lag rahaa tha ki aam aadamiyon kii samasyaon par aadhaarit yah kaaphi majboot kahani he, lekin film dekhte vakt yahi sabit hota he ki khoda pahaad nikali chuhia
 It could have turned out to be a very good story but the makers failed to make it
 film ke samvaad bhi kuch khaas nahin he
 The film is a story of the common man, but is unable to connect with the common man
 film main villen ke rup main nishikant kaamat he, lekin unki bhi dabangiyat kaaphi kamjor dikhaai detii he
 Why watch the film: The background score of the film is good and both actors have done a great job as a friend of Harshvardhan Kapoor
