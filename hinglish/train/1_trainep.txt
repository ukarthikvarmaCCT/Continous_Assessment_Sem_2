 masarrat alam kii rihaai par sansad main vabal machaa hua he
 The Prime Minister is also on the backfoot along with the government
 pradhanmantri ko safai deni padi
 The Home Minister says that he did not even talk to the Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir
 sarkaar se donon sadanon main safai dete nahin ban paa rahaa he
 Congress leader Saifuddin Soz said that Masrat Alam was kept in jail for four and a half years, but no charge sheet was filed against him
 use jail main rakhane kaa koi kanoonee aadesh nahin liya gaya
 Can not hire anyone like this
 grih mantri ko puure halaat kii tafatish kerani chahie or tathyon ke saath saamne aana chahie, lekin congress ne sansad main masarrat alam kii rihaai kaa virodh kar rashtriya vipaksh kaa role nibhaayaa he
 This means that Kashmir thinks something else and the rest of the country something else
 jo log kashmir ko jaanate hai unka maananaa he ki baaki desh kashmir ke maamle main dimag se kam or dil se zyada sochataa he
 So do we get more emotional about Kashmir
 masarrat alam kii rihaai koi ek maamla nahin he
 There are many cases that will come up
 ab pataa chalaa he ki masarrat alam ko chhodane kaa faisla raashtrapati saasana ke dauraan liya gaya tha, yani isaki jaankaree kendriya grih mantralay ko honi chahie khaas kar kashmir cell ko
 The pdp's statement that the Jammu and Kashmir government will follow the court's decision on the release of political prisoners
 yani mufti sarkaar ne gend court ke paale main daal diya he
 The court also said that if the prisoner has served his sentence, he can be released
 aise main jis agle kaidi ke rihaai kii charchaa he, uskaa naam faktu he, jo 22 saal se jail main band he, yani vah apni sajaa kaat chukaa he
 Now the question arises why the Mufti government is doing all this
 apni ek maheene puraani sarkaar ko vah itani jaldi khatre main kyon daal rahe hai
 Is he teasing the BJP? mufti raajnneeti ke maahir khilaadi hai, bijepi ko unase bahut kuch siikhnaa hoga
 The mufti first formed a government with the Congress and was promised to run the government for three years, but the mufti withdrew support from the Ghulam Nabi Azad government
 pehali baar bhi mukhyamantri banate hi mufti ne hurriyat netaaon ko reeha kiya tha
 This time, soon after becoming the Chief Minister, Mufti thanked the separatists as well as Pakistan for the successful election
 yah baat bhi sach he ki is baar algaavvaadiyon ne chunaav bahishkaar kaa koi naaraa nahin diya tha
 The vicious mind of the Mufti is understandable here
 jammu kashmir ke mukhyamantri kii ranneeti he ki agar is mudde par bijepi sarkaar se sarmathan vaapis leti he to mufti turant chunaav chaahegein
 The Mufti is eyeing 46 seats in the Kashmir Valley as well as 6 seats in Jammu which are Muslim majority
 jammu kashmir main kul 87 siten hai
 The same strategy behind the Mufti thanks to the separatists and Pakistan is that they also want to vote for those who are considered supporters of these two
 yah ek aisi sachai he jisase ham inkaar nahin kar sakate
 At the same time, the BJP is eyeing 37 seats in Jammu, that is, politics is taking place from both sides and the BJP has to decide whether it wants to think like the rest of the country or like Kashmir
 vaise bhi yah bemail shaadi he, adhik dinon tak to chalani nahin
 The sooner BJP withdraws support, the better it will be for them or else Mufti Saheb's bat bat
 dilli main hatya kii ek aisi vaardaat hui he ki logon kaa dosti se bharosa uth jaae
 At the Anand Vihar bus station in East Delhi, a man killed his friend by beating him with a stick just because he refused to give his jacket
 ravivaar kii shaam hameshaa kii tarah anand vihaar bas adde par acchhee khaasi bheed thi
 a person named Balbir was supposed to catch a bus and go somewhere
 uskaa dost shankar use bas adde pahunchane ke liye saath main aayaa tha
 It was frost in the evening
 shankar ne jacket pahana tha, jabaki balbir ke paas koi bhi garm kapadaa nahin tha
 Balbir asks Shakkar to give him his jacket
 lekin shankar ne jacket dene se manaa kar diya
 a quarrel ensued over this
 balbir nejbaran shankar kii jacket utaarne kii koshishki
 The fight between the two turned into a scuffle
 yah sab kuch saikadon logon ke bich ghat rahaa tha
 Meanwhile, Balbir was shown a stick lying nearby
 usne danda uthaaya or apane dost shankar kii pitayee shuru kar di
 Balbir kept beating Pankar with a stick until he died
 shankar ko mrit dekh balbir maukey se bhaag gaya
 The police came in awe after listening to the public slaughter
 police ne hatyaropee ko pakadaney ke liye kai timen gathit kin
 The accused Balbir was arrested shortly afterwards
 lekin police us vakt chaunk gai jab use balbir ne bataaya ki usne jacket ke liye apane dost kaa katl kiya
 It may be noted that a similar murder case came to light two days ago in Adarsh nagar area in Delhi, when a man was murdered for demanding egg money

 kejariwal ne ek kaarykram main nitish kumaar ke saath shaamil hone ke liye aaj bihar kaa daura kiya
 The BJP referred to Nitish Kumar's alliance with the Lalu Prasad-led RJD and the Congress to attack Kejriwal, as the Delhi chief minister has been targeting both these parties in the past
 bijepi pravaktaa sambit paatra ne kejariwal ke aktubar 2013 ke twit kaa zikr kiya, jisamen unhone chaara ghotaalaa maamle main lalu prasad ko kuch varshon kii jail or 25 lakh rupee jurmaane ko ek 'acha sauda' qaraar diya tha
 Patra also referred to a tweet by Kejriwal's aide and Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia, in which he had spoken of listening to the 'goondagardi' story of Kumar and Prasad during their Bihar tour
 unhone kejariwal par nitish kaa samarthan karne or lalu se duuri banane kii koshishon ko lekar nishaanaa saadhaa or kaha ki unhen argedy netaa ke saath apana sambandh spasht karnaa chahie
 The comments vahiin patna main bijepi ke varisht netaa susheel kumaar modi ne press vijyapti jari kar kaha, 'kejariwal bataaen ki kya aaj bihar main nitish kumaar kii sarkaar usee lalu prasad or congress ke badaulat nahin tiki he jo bhrashtachar ke paryaay hai? kejariwal kya nitish kumaar kaa samarthan kar bhrashtachar ke pratik congress or ghotaale ke sajayaftaa lalu prasad kaa samarthan nahin kar rahe hai?'

 gaya roderej maamle ke 150 se adhik ghante guzar chuke hai, lekin jediu vidhayak manorama devi ab tak bihar police kii pakad se dur he
 The SIT of Gaya Police has been raiding continuously for the past 5 days, but they cannot even get a clue if Manorama is caught
 manorama kii khoj main police jharkhand tak main chhapemari kar chuki he
 Despite all, the result has been a cipher
 police par lag rahaa he dhulmul ravaie kaa aaropis maamle main pehle din se hi police par dhulmul ravaiya lagane kaa aarope lag rahaa he
 Despite making SIT, the police did not catch any of the accused in this murder case
 jediu vidhayak manorama devior argedy se jude sthaneey dabang bindi yadav kaa betaa rocky yadav ko ek deal ke tahat khud manorama ne police ke hawaale kiya
 After this, the second accused Teni Yadav also surrendered in Gaya court easily defying the police security
 baap ke nakshe kadam par betaa
 
 
 Know, black history of Bindi Yadav! Police and SIT are not even aware of the accused in this case
 is dauraan sabase bada sawaal yah bana hua he ki manorama devi aakhir hai kahaan? unke chupane ko masale main is vakt kai theory par charchaa kii ja rahi he
 Theory 1- Manorama is under the protection of Naxalites According to sources, Manorama Devi is in a safe area of naxalites around the city of Gaya
 un ilaakon main ghusna police ke liye lagbhag naammumkin he
 Many villages in Imamganj, Mohanpur and Barachatti forests are called den of Naxalites
 police vahaan din main bhi jane kii himmat nahin dikhaati
 Manorama can be hidden in these areas located just 45-60 km from the city of Gaya
 haalanki kai jagahon par police ne red kiya he lekin usemanorama haath nahin lagihai
 This theory is most likely to be true
 theory 2- jharkhand main bindi yadav kaa purana thikanamanorama devi gaya se sate jharkhand kii seemaayi ilaake main ho sakati he
 Bindi Yadav had an old hideout in Hunterganj, Jharkhand where he has hidden several times to escape from the police
 aise main police ko vahaan bhi chhipe hone kaa andeshaa he, lekin shanivaar raat ko vahaan chhapemari main bhi manorama devi haath nahin ai
 Police suspect that Manorama may still be held in the same area
 kyonki vah ilaaka bindi yadav ke guru kallu singh kaa he
 Together with her, Bindi has built such a huge empire
 ho saktaa he manorama ne vahiin panaah le rakhi ho
 Theory 3 - The location for surrender in the city itself According to a theory, Manorama Devigaya can be found at a safe place within the city, so that he can surrender immediately instead of arrest if needed
 police ko aise kai thikaanon kii soochna mili thi
 Based on this, police searched Bindi Yadav's brother Sheetal Yadav's house
 vahaan bhi manorama nahin milin
 There are many houses where Manorama can take shelter easily
 theory 4- giraftaar ke bajaay dabaav bana rahi he policechauthi theory ke mutabik police manorama devi ko pakadaney ke bajaay un par dabaav banane kii theory par kaam kar rahi he
 The police know that her husband and son have gone to jail
 sarkaarunaki sampatti ke adhigrahanaki taiyaari main he
 In such a situation, Manorama will not be able to bear much pressure and will soon be under the grip of the police

 England batsman Kevin Pietersen has dismissed speculation that he is going to say goodbye to cricket after spinner Graeme Swann

 He said, i am 33 years old and batting better than before
 main us din sanyas luungaa, jab england ke liye acha khel nahin sakuunga, philhal to main bahut acha khel rahaa hum
 He refused to get into rhetoric after Swann's retirement, saying, "I don't want to think about it
" philhal meraa dhyaan 26 disambar se shuru ho rahe melbern test par he
 i am practicing for the same
 yah poochne par ki australia se lagaataar teen test haarane ke baad kya england team main badlaav kii jarurat he, petersan ne kaha, mujhe lagata he ki ham sabit kar chuke hai ki ham vishwa stareey cricketer hai
 Three matches do not spoil a player
 aisa nahin he ki australia se 5-0 se haarane ke baad bhi aapke kariyar main koi acha din nahin aayega

 pruthak telugana rajya ke gathan ke mudde par vistrut adhyayan ke liye banaai gai shrikrishna samiti ne apni report main pesh kiye gaye chah vikalpon main andhra pradesh ko ekikrut rajya banaae rakhane ko sarvshereshth vikalp bataaya he
 According to the committee, formation of Telangana state is the second best option
 raajnneetik dalon ne saaf shabdon main kaha he ki unhen alag telugana rajya se kam kuch bhi manjuur nahin he
 Union Home Minister P
 chidambaram ne is report ke silsile main bulaai gai sarvadaleey baithak main shaamil hue raajnneetik dalon se charchaa ke baad guuruuvaar ko ise saarvajanik kiya
 What is in the report, and what is the opinion of the committee: - The first of the six options suggested in this report released on Thursday on the website of the Union Home Ministry is to maintain the current situation
 samiti ne apane sarvasammat vichaar main kaha he ki jaisi paristhiti he use usee tarah chhod dena vyavhaarik nahin hoga
 Some intervention is necessary
 samiti ke mutabik is vikalp ko sabase kam logon ne pasand kiya
 The second option presented by the committee is to divide the state into Seemandhra and Telangana
 isamen hyderabad ko centre shasit pradesh kaa darja die jane tathaa donon kshetron dwaara aane vaale samay main apni-apni rajdhaniyaan viksit karne kii baat kahi gai he
 The committee in its response has described this option as impractical
 samiti ne tisare vikalp main rajya ko royal-telugana or tateey andhra main bantwaare kii baat kahi he jisamen hyderabad ko royal-telugana kaa abhinn hissaa banaae jane kii baat he
 The committee has said that neither pro-telangana nor united Andhra supporters will accept it
 samiti ke mutabik yah vikalp teenon kshetron ke logon ko sweekaarya nahin hoga
 In its fourth option, the committee has divided Andhra Pradesh into Seemandhra and Telangana and said that the Greater Hyderabad metropolis should be made a separate union territory
 is centre shasit pradesh kii bhugolic sthiti rajya ke teenon hisson se sambandhit rahegi
 According to the committee, the supporters of Telangana will strongly oppose it and hence there will be no political consensus on this option
 samiti ne apane paanchave vikalp main kaha he ki rajya ko vartmaan seemaa kshetra ke maddenjar telugana or simandhra main baant diya jaae
 Hyderabad should be made the capital of Telangana and the Seemandhra region should be chosen as its new capital
 samiti ne kaha ki is vikalp par vichaar kiya ja saktaa he
 According to him, there is some merit in the demand of Telangana state and it is not completely unwarranted
 is vikalp ke sabhi pahaluon par vichaar karne ke baad samiti ne apni raay main kaha he ki alag telugana rajya ke gathan se kshetra kii adhikansh janata santusht mahasoos karegi lekin iske saath hi kai samasyaayein bhi khadi ho jaaengi
 The committee has said that considering the pros and cons of this option, it considers it the second best option
 yah tabhi ho jab ise rokna asambhav ho jaae or teenon kshetron ke logon ke bich shantipurna sahmati bane
 The committee, in its sixth and final choice, has said to keep the state unified and provide constitutional powers for the social and economic development of the Telangana region and its political empowerment and constitution of a Telangana Regional Council with constitutional power
 samiti ne kaha he ki rashtriya paridrishy ko dekhte hue yah vikalp sarvshereshth he or ise aage badhaayaa ja saktaa he
 According to the committee, this option will be in the interest of all three areas
 chidambaram ne kaha, khule dimag se iskaa adhyayan ho :- samiti kii report par kendriya grih mantri pi
 Chidambaram on Thursday urged all political parties and groups to draw any results on this report only after studying it with an open mind
 chidambaram ne report par charchaa ke liye bulaai gai sarvadaleey baithak ke baad samvaadadaataaon se kaha, "main sabhi raajnneetik dalon va maamle se jude sabhi pakshon se aagrah karata hum ki ve report ko puri tarah padhe bina koi taatkaalik parinaam na nikaalen
 Six options have been suggested in this and the committee has also presented its approach with information on the pros and cons of each option
 " unhone kaha ki samiti ne hi pehle teenon vikalpon ko avyavhaarik bataate hue khaarij kar diya he
 The remaining three options can be traced further
 report nahin he manjuur inhen :- telugana raashtra samiti (tiares) or telugu desham party (tedepa) ke telugana kshetra ke netaaon ne samiti kii report par niraashaa jaahir karte hue kaha ki unhen pruthak telugana rajya ke gathan ke alaava koi vikalp manjuur nahin
 TRS MLA
 tarkaramaa raav ne samvaadadaataaon ko bataaya ki is samasya kaa ekmaatr vyaavhaarik hal pruthak telugana rajya kaa gathan he jo 10 jilon ko milakar banaaya jaae or hyderabad ko uski rajdhani banaai jaae
 Rao said, "any other option suggested by the committee is not acceptable to the people of Telangana
 centre sarkaar ko logon kii bhaawanaaon kaa sammaan karte hue or apane vaayade ke anuroop pruthak telugana rajya ke gathan ke liye tatkaal kadam uthaanaa chahie
 "TDP leaders of Telangana region also rejected the Srikrishna Committee report
 unhone kaha ki kshetra ke logon ko pruthak telugana rajya se kam kuch bhi manjuur nahin he
 TDP Telangana Forum coordinator Nagam Janardhan Reddy said, "we were hoping that the committee would suggest a direct alternative to the formation of Telangana state but it has insulted the people of the region by making various suggestions
 " purv mantri ne kaha, "main congress ko chetavanee detaa hum ki vah logon kii bhaawanaaon ke saath na khele or sansad ke agle satr main vidheyak laakar telugana kaa gathan kare
 "the Communist Party of India (CPI) has said that the report of the committee has created confusion

 Narayan said that the central government should not delay the formation of Telangana
 bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) ne centre sarkaar par aarope lagaaya ki vah telugana ke mudde par bachakaana ravaiya apana rahi he or uske ravaiye se andhra pradesh kii janata ko nuksaan ho rahaa he

 However, a charge sheet has already been filed in this case
 munde ne kaha ki bhima koregaanv hinsa maamle main buddhijiviyon, saamaajik kaaryakartaaon or nagarikon ko naksali bataakar unke khilaaf farji cese darj kiye gaye the
 Apart from Dhananjay Munde, NCP leader Prakash Gajbhiye has also written a letter to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray demanding withdrawal of the case registered in Bhima Koregaon case
 uddhav bole- fadanvis sarkaar ne diya tha cese vaapasi kaa aadeshwahin, maharashtra ke mukhyamantri uddhav thakare ne kaha ki fadanvis sarkaar ne bhima koregaanv hinsa maamle main darj cese waapas lene kaa aadesh diya tha

 notebandi ke baad banking system main waapas laute puraane noton par rigerv bank ke aankade jari hone ke baad vipaksh sarkaar ke khilaaf hamalavar ho gaya he
 The opposition has been critical of the government's demonetization move since the beginning and now it has got a chance to attack the government once the figures are released
 vipaksh notebandi ko puri tarah se flop sho bataa rahaa he
 In a special conversation with India Today's consulting editor Rajdeep Sardesai, former Union Minister Chidambaram completely rejected the central government's claim that demonetisation was successful
 unhone sarkaar ke is daawey kii bhi hawa nikaalane kii koshish kii ki notebandi kaa mul uddeshy desh main cashles economi ko badhaava dena tha
 Here are special parts of this interview
 
 
 sawaal: notebandi par rigerv bank ke report or aankadon ne anumaan ke mutabik hi raajnneetik hangaamaa khadaa kar diya he
 The opposition is showing this as evidence that demonetisation has failed
 is bare main aapane hi sabase zyada kathorta or bebaaki se bolaa tha
 You said in many tweets that demonetisation is a continuous disaster
 kahin aapaki pratikriya is vajah se hi thodi atirek to nahin ho gai ki aap vipaksh main hai?jawaab: pehali baat to main yah kahuunga ki aap ise kathorta na kahen
 i spoke on the basis of facts and the conclusions drawn from the facts go exactly opposite to the three objectives stated by the government and by the Prime Minister
 sawaal: lekin aapane apane twit main jin shabdon kaa istemaal kiya he, unka kya matlab samajha jaae?jawaab: ve tathyon par aadhaarit bayaan hai
 Every word of his is correct
 99% notes legally exchanged! Was demonetisation a scheme designed to convert black money into white?— P
 Chidambaram (@pchidambaram_in) August 30, 2017 Question: But is your response not redundant? When the government is claiming that the glass is half full
 arun jetali kaa kahana he ki yah arthvyavastha ke aupchaarik rup lene kii disha main ek bada kadam he or ise sirf note waapas hone ke aankadon se nahin taula janaa chahie
 Answer: But they had set this objective themselves
 yah teen uddeshyon main se ek tha
 The Attorney General had then told the Supreme Court that the government felt that 4-5 lakh crores would not be returned to the Reserve Bank and would benefit the government
 notebandi se badha kaala dhan!sawaal: niti ayog ke navaniyukt upaadhyaksh rajeev kumaar ne kaha he ki is baat par dhyaan na den ki kaale dhan kaa pravaah hua yaa nahin balki iske bhandar par gaur karen
 The government has attacked the morass of black money present in the system
 kumaar ne kaha ki chidambaram kii is soch ke vipareet ki kaala dhan safed ho chukaa he, sach yah he ki kaala dhan ab grey ho chukaa he or iskar vibhaag tathaa idi is par aasaani se nishaanaa saadh sakate hai
 Answer: i do not want to comment on a person who has just been appointed
 unke kaarybhaar grahan karne ke teen din baad hi sarkaar ne niti ayog kii report ko khaarij kar diya
 The government's objective was to hit the black money reserves
 lekin tathy yah he ki ham hameshaa yah kehete rahe ki notebandi se is bhandar par koi chot nahin pahonchegi, balki or kaala dhan paidaa hoga
 This will only hurt that 3-4 lakh crore reserves, which have not come in the system
 lekin iskaa matlab yah he ki jiske paas bhi blike mani hogi, use is white mani main tabdeel karne kaa rasta mil jayega
 That is why i kept questioning it
 aisa lagata he ki ise kaale dhan ko safed dhan main badalane waalon kii madad ke liye laayaa gaya
 Question: The Government has to say that now they have actually come to know which accounts have been deposited in the system and thus they can now punish such people and disclose their name
 jawaab: chaliye sarkaar se ek sawaal poochhate hai or uskaa jawaab lete hai
 The government claims that about Rs 16,000 crore worth of black money has been identified and cash worth Rs 1,000 crore has been seized
 ab aap pichley saalon ke iskar vibhaag ke record ko dekhen
 Every year the Income Tax Department states that it has detected so many thousand crores of undisclosed income and seized 500-1000 crores
 aankada lagbhag itnaa hi hota he
 There is nothing new in this
 yahi nahin ye aankade antim bhi nahin hote
 Even after this, people get a chance to appeal
 in apil main antim nirnay aane ke baad hi pataa chalata he ki iskar vibhaag ne jo nakadi jabt kii he usamen kitna tex he or kitna kaala dhan
 No conclusion can be reached on the basis of seizure of Income Tax Department
 maine kareeb 10 saal tak aisa dekha he ki iskar vibhaag har saal aise daawa karata he
 There are other ways to monitor the transaction
 Question: So you are not ready to accept the government's argument that the account holders can now be identified
 kareeb 3 lakh karod rakam ke khaataa dharak jaanch ke daayre main hai?jawaab: aise khatadharak hameshaa hi jaanch ke daayre main rahe hai
 For example, when i introduced the Cash Transaction Tax, the intention behind this was to keep an eye on people who deposit or withdraw cash
 hamen aise bahut se log mili jinke khilaaf karrwai kii gai
 When we introduced Suspicious Transaction Reporting, we still came to know a lot of people
 logon par nigaraanee rakhane ke tamaam tareeke hai
 It cannot be claimed that demonetisation is a way of keeping an eye on people
 nakli noton ke liye notebandi koi rasta nahinswaal: sarkaar apane ek uddeshy nakli noton par ankush lagane ke bare main bhi daawa karegi, bhale yah bahut kam hua ho (
 xxrep 4 0 8 per cent)
 kam se kam is disha main kuch prayaas to kiya gaya
 Answer: NIA together with a Kolkata institution has found out that the total fake notes are worth 400 crores
 zyaadaatar desh har do yaa teen saal main apane noton ke dizin main badlaav kar nakli noton se nipatane kii koshish karte hai
 For this, new features are added to the notes and notes before a specified date are declared invalid
 pehle bhi aisa kiya jaataa rahaa he or is raste ko aage bhi apnaanaa chahie
 Demonetization is not done to deal with fake notes
 iske alaava yah bhi dekhie ki ab 2000 ke bhi nakli note aa gaye hai
 How will the government respond to this? Question not funding terrorism: You have also been the former Home Minister and the current government claims that demonetisation has curbed the funding of visitors
 sarkaar kaa daawa he ki notebandi se naksali ghatnaayen kam hui hai or kuch had tak teror funding kaa galaa ghonta ja sakaa he
 Answer: Let's take the example of terrorist incidents
 mere paas kuch aankade hai
 Talk of Kashmir where terrorism and terror funding has been at its peak
 saal 2007 main aatankwaad se hone vaali mautein 2016 ke mukaable zyada hui hai
 The number of incidents, civilians and soldiers killed, has been higher in all respects
 isliye agar yah maan len ki kashmir main aatankwaad kaala dhan yaa nakli noton se poshit ho rahaa he, to notebandi ke is uddeshy main to koi safalataa hasil nahin hui he
 Question: What will be said on Naxalite incidents? Answer: Naxalite incidents have been declining since 2009
 maine isamen kamyaabi pai thi
 This decline is continuing because this government is following the policies of the previous government
 iske liye mujhe unase koi chidh nahin hoti, balki main unki saraahna karata hum
 But please do not add it to demonetisation
 sawaal: sarkaar kaa yah bhi daawa he ki notebandi se cashles arthvyavastha, arthvyavastha ke digitigeshan ko badhaava mila he, digital tranjaction main 20 fisadi kii badhat hui he?jawaab: yah notebandi kaa mulya uddeshy nahin tha
 Question: So there is no significant increase in electronic payments
 Are you accusing the government that the government has changed its target? Answer: Look at the facts
 november 2016 main gaiyr nakadi yaa electronic bhugtan 94 lakh karod rupee kaa hua tha
 94 in May 2017, six months after demonetisation
 21 lakh karod rupee rahaa
 Therefore, there is no evidence that there has been a sharp jump in non-cash transactions
 ab bhi is desh main lenden kaa mukhya tarika nakadi hi he
 Increasing digital transactions is a good thing
 sach to yah he ki main bhi lenden ke digitigeshan kaa samarthan karata hum
 But before saying that demonetisation promotes digitization in transactions, also note that millions of people were standing in line in the sun and rain, 104 people died
 bahut se chote or majhole udhyam barbaad ho gaye
 1
5 million jobs lost
 arthvyavastha 7-8 fisadi se 6-7 fisadi ke daayre main aa gai
 Can the government say that digitization is the answer to all these crises? There was no demonetisation in the state elections
 Masalaswal: BJP has won almost every election since November 2016
 isliye raajnneetik lihaaj se dekhen to tamaam saamaajik, aarthik or maanviya keemat chukaane ke baad bhi log notebandi ko manyata de rahe hai?jawaab: media bhi kitni aasaani se dhokhe main aa jaati he
 Elections to five states took place at the same time (in March)
 upi main bijepi ko jabardast jeet mili
 So you came to the conclusion that people have voted in favor of demonetisation
 lekin usee samay punjab ke logon ne bijepi ko buree tarah thukraayaa
 So what would you conclude about Punjab? People in Goa and Manipur pushed the BJP to second place
 to kya aap yah kahenge ki notebandi kaa aadhe logon ne hi samarthan kiya he
 i think all these are simple conclusions
 kisi bhi rajya kaa chunaav in masalon par nahin ladaa jaataa
 Nothing other than economy can be made the basis of right or wrong of demonetisation
 sawaal: lekin ek soch yah he ki upie yaa congress party ne kaale dhan se nipatane ke liye bahut kam prayaas kiya
 Now the NDA government, promising to hurt black money, is doing something
 ab vipaksh is saahas ke liye sarkaar kii tarif karne kii bajaay yathasthiti banaae rakhane kaa samarthan kar rahaa he or kaale dhan ko arthvyavastha main banaae rakhana chahta he
 Answer: This is again a wrong thing
 ab bhi vahi iskar vibhaag he
 He was the first director and is now the Chief Vigilance Commissioner
 aap sarkaar se yah kahen ki vah saal 1999 se lekar ab tak ke (vaajepayi or manmohan singh ke kaarykaal ke bhi) har saal ke aankade prakashit kare
 In this, the government should give complete information about the income tax department's raids, seizure, unaccounted income, how many cases have been prosecuted, how much tax has been imposed
 to aap dekhenge ki saal-dar-saal aankade lagbhag ek hi hai
 Demonetisation is not the solution to the problem
 Question: What do you think is the way? Answer: Please understand that India's economic and tax structure is very unique
 hamaare yahaan kareeb aadhi jansankhya ke paas vaid rup se bina tex lage aamadani hoti he-jaise kisaan, dharmik sansthaaen, dharmik trust, charity, purvottar main rahane vaale log, adivasee aadi
 Along with this a large population is also legally tax-paying
 jab tak yah dohare sanrachana vaali arthvyavastha he, ek sanrachana se duusare sanrachana tak dhan kaa pravaah lagaataar hota rahegaa
 For example, a 2000 note goes from one hand to another 20 times a day, it can be white or black money
 isliye samaadhaan yah he ki tex kii kam daren rakhkar zyada se zyada logon ko tex dene ke liye protsaahit kiya jaae
 i did it in 1997
 20 saal tak aisa test karnaa chahie
 If tax rates are low, tax administration is more friendly, then people are encouraged to pay taxes and file returns
 iske alaava lenden par najar rakhane ke liye cash tranjaction tex, sandigdh lenden kii reporting, third party reporting aadi saadhan hai
 Therefore, the government should consider other means
 notebandi koi samaadhaan nahin he
 The base of the minor tax payers has increased
 Question: Does the government also say that now the tax payers have increased and this is also the result of demonetisation? Answer: You media people do not question the government
 aap sarkaar se sawaal karne se darate hai
 You ask them questions
 pichley 15 saal main har saal tex base badha he
 Yes, there has been a good growth in the tax base this year, but the average taxable income among the returns filed
 7 lakh rupee hi he, jo ki kar chhot vaale daayre se thodaa hi zyada he
 Therefore, the income tax charged from them will also be very small
 aap sarkaar se yah puuchhie ki vah is baat kaa khulaasa kare ki ritern bharne vaale kitne logon par kisi tarah kaa tex nahin banataa
 Welcome to the attack on political funding: The government is also claiming that demonetisation has curbed black money in important areas like real estate and the finance minister has said that the next target of the government is political funding
 jawaab: are unhen aisa karne dijie
 We have no problem
 pichley teen saal main sabase zyada 707 karod rupee kaa chanda bijepi ko hi mila he
 They target political funding, there is nothing wrong in that
 arthvyavastha ke kai duusare sector hai jinamein kaala dhan panapata he
 Such as production sector, film industry, capitation fees in educational institutions, corruption in administration, political funding etc
 itani raajnneetik reliyaan hoti hai, bataaie ve yah daawa kar sakate hai ki raily main kharch hue sabhi rakam kaa bhugtan check se hua he
 This election costs so much black money
 in sabhi sector main kaale dhan ko panpane se kaise rokenge?rigerv bank ke garvanar hai jimmedaar!sawaal: aapaki is tikhi aalochana ko dekhte hue ham kahen ki jo kuch bhi galat ho rahaa he uske liye aapke hisaab se koun jimmedaar ho saktaa he-rigerv bank ke governor yaa sarkaar ke mukhya aarthik salaahkaar
 Answer: i do not think that the Chief Economic Advisor had advised or supported the demonetisation
 7 november ko ek letters milane ke baad rigerv bank ke governor ne hadabadi dikhaai or unhone 8 november ko iskaa suzav de diya
 i think they should not have done this
 mujhe lagata he ki unhen sabak mil gaya hoga
 Question: Manmohan Singh called it organized robbery and theft
 jawaab: unhone ise abhootpurv kuprabandhan bataaya tha
 Which is absolutely right
 yah baat sabit ho chuki he
 When it seems that every person who has a stock of black money has made it white, then it will be called loot in the economy

 com / 3w4zzmqkwg Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi is once again visiting the state in the fourth and final phase of the Gujarat Navsarjan Yatra
 teen divasiy daure ke duusare din ravivaar ko rahul banaaskantha pahunche
 Here he met members of the Congress' social media team
 is dauraan rahul ne gujarat chunaav main istemaal kiye ja rahe congress ke naare ko chhodane ke bare main bhi bataaya
 The Congress Vice President said that when Prime Minister Narendra Modi gave a new slogan in response to the Congress slogan, 'I am Vikas', we stopped using Vikas Gaya Gaya
 darasal, gujarat main chunaav prachaar ke dauraan congress 'vikaas gando thayo che' yani vikaas pagal ho gaya he, naare se bijepi sarkaar ko gherne kaa kaam kar rahi thi
 After this, when PM Modi went to Gujarat, he used the slogan 'I am Gujarat, i am development'
 rahul gandhi ne bataaya ki piem modi ne jab khud ko vikaas bataaya to unhone gujarat ke congress prabharee ashok gahalot ko is sambandh likhaa or unase pradhanmantri pad kii garima banaae rakhane kii baat kahi
 Rahul said, 'I instructed not to insult the Prime Minister's post
 maine team ko kaha ki ham wo nahin karenge jo wo (modi ji) manmohan singh ke pradhanmantri pad par rahete hue unke liye karte the
 What Ashok Gehlot said: Gujarat in-charge and National General Secretary of Congress Ashok Gehlot said that when PM Modi gave a slogan to call himself development, Rahul Gandhi wrote to me in this regard
 gahalot ne bataaya, 'rahul gandhi ne mujhe likhakar nijee hamale nahin karne ke liye kaha
 After which we instructed our team not to use the slogan Vikas Gando Theo
 'haal hi main khabar ai thi ki rahul gandhi ne party kaaryakartaaon ko gujarat chunaav main pradhanmantri narendra modi par nijee hamalon se bachane ke liye kaha he
 After which, for the first time, the reason behind this has been given by Rahul and the Congress
 gujarat police ne 15 saal baad ahmedabad ke charchit sajani hatyakand kaa khulaasa kar diya he
 The accused in this case turned out to be none other than Sajni's husband
 jisane varsh 2003 main velentine de ke din apni patni sajani ko maut kii neend sula diya tha kyonki uski jindagi main ek duusari ladki aa gai thi
 When Gujarat crime branch unveiled the 15-year-old murder case, then the husband of killer Sajni turned out to be Tarun Dinnaraj
 police ne use bengalooru se giraftaar kiya he
 This was the whole matter date 14 February 2003
 puri duniya mohabbat kaa tyohaar yani velentine de manaa rahi thi
 On the same day, a blood Holi was played in a house in Bopal area of ahmedabad
 vahaan ek katl hua tha
 a woman's body was found lying on the third floor of the flat
 uske paas hi uskaa pati baitha ro rahaa tha
 Police reached the spot
 laash ko kabje main lekar postmortem ke liye bheja
 The husband was questioned by the police
 wo baar-baar bayaan badalata rahaa
 Sometimes he said that someone killed his wife
 to kabhi kaha ki uski maut kudarti thi
 The police kept questioning him but could not arrest him
 kyonki police ke paas uske khilaaf koi saboot nahin tha
 After the incident, the husband was hospitalized after interrogation and then the drama of the disease
 police ko kaatil kaa koi suraag nahin mila
 Meanwhile, the deceased's husband suddenly disappeared from the hospital
 police uski talash karti rahi
 His relatives and friends were interrogated but the man was not caught by the police
 police ne use gujarat hi nahin balki aas-paas ke rajyon main bhi talash kiya
 But he had no trace of it
 police nemritka ke patiki talash band kar di
 But the case did not close
 isi dauraan 15 saal baad achaanak gujarat police ko soochna mili ki mritka sajani kaa pati tarun: police ne tarun ko arest karne ke liye anek rajyon main uski talash kii, par uskaa koi ata-pataa nahin mil paaya
 Recently, the police came to know that Tarun was changing his name to live in Bengaluru
 krime branch ko pataa chalaa ki tarun ne duusari shaadi bhi kar lee he
 He also has two children
 team ne pehle tarun ke ek rishtedaar ko phone par tres kiya
 Then Tarun's number was obtained from his number
 us number ke jariye hi krime branch kii team bengalooru main uske thikaane tak ja pahunchi or tarun ko giraftaar kar liya
 The Gujarat police had also announced a reward of Rs one lakh on Tarun after he disappeared from the hospital

 ek taraf america kaa rajya nevada he to is ore punjab kaa deraa beas
 Both places are at two different ends of the world, but there is a great similarity between the two
 donon jagahon par ek jaise dikhne vaale vishaal bhukhand hai, jinka uddeshy samaan he
 India has made a huge leap in solar mission, has emerged as a major center of solar power generation in the US, while in May this year, Punjab installed the world's largest roof top solar panel at Dera Beas
 is kadam ke saath bharat ke solar mishan kii mahatvakanksha ne ek badi chalaang lagaai he
 Here, one sees a line of sun-glazing, dark and glowing solar panels
 in panelon se svachh urja kaa utpaadan ho rahaa he
 Many experts are also telling this to solve the energy problem of India
 gaanvon ke bijleekaran main ye he sabase badi badhapradhanmantri narendra modi kii sabase pasandida pariyojnaon main se ek gramin kshetron kaa vidyutikaran he
 But the huge cost of energy is the biggest obstacle in this direction
 bharat ab bhi paramparaagat urja sroton jaise koyala, tel or gas par hi nirbhar he (us par se yah urja svachh bhi nahin he)
 More than 30 crore people of this country still do not have access to electricity
 is sandarbh main saura urja ko svachh bijli kaa ek dirghakaalik or tikaoo upaay mana ja rahaa he
 The Prime Minister's 'surya Namaskar' was welcomed by the whole world at the Paris Climate Conference held in December 2015, where he announced the formation of the International Solar Alliance (ISA) by combining 120 countries
 paris main unhone kaha tha, ''solar (energy) nai ummid kaa suryoday he
 Not only for clean energy, but also for all the villages and homes, which are still in the darkness and where the sun will illuminate in the dark mornings and evenings
 '' bharat ne 2022 tak navikarniya urja ke vibhinn sroton se 100 gigawatt bijli paidaa karne ke lakshya kii ghoshnaa kii
 (india's total capacity 42 as on April 30, 2016
 8 gigawatt thi)
 Solar energy projects in the country have received greater impetus after the Paris conference as a large number of new companies have entered the sector
 naveen or navikarniya urja mantralay main sanyukt sachiv tarun kapur kehete hai, ''saura urja ke liye mahatvapurn protsaahan tarriff niti main sanshodhan ke jariye aayaa he kyonki isse vitaran companiyaan bijli kharidne ke liye raji ho jaaengi
 Its current fee 4
 50-4
 70 Rs
 prati unit ke bich he, jo koyala utpaadit bijli ke baraabar he or iskaa sabase bada laabh yah he ki yah shulk bazaar ke utaar-chadhaav par nirbhar nahin he
 For the next 25 years, this fee will remain the same, which will increase the confidence of investors
 '' lekin tata power solar ke kaaryakari nideshak or siio ashish khanna is maamle main thodaa sashankit dikhte hai
 He says, "due to too aggressive bids and loose entry rules, even low-profile companies are entering the solar energy sector
" isaki vajah se unhen na sirf pariyojnaon or nivesh main nuksaan uthaanaa pad rahaa he, balki nivesh karne vaale logon ke bich maahaul bhi kharaab ho rahaa he
 This is affecting the entire solar energy industry
 pratispardhaa apni jagah ahm he, lekin nai companiyon ke trek record or kaam karne kii kshamta kii pehle jaanch kar lee jaani chahie
 "building confidence among investors about the power of solar has also been a major challenge in itself as the solar energy business was seen to be weak at first due to decreasing fees
 ab dhire-dhire in pariyojnaon ke liye paisa aa rahaa he
 62 to install Roof Top Solar Power Panel in India by World Bank in early May
 5 lakh dollar ke anudaan ko manjuuri di he
 There is also talk of additional grant of 12 million dollars
 yah anudaan mukhyatah audyogic / vanijyik kshetra ke liye hoga, jise rajya puunjigat sabsidi nahin detaa he
 Solar Industry in India In the initial phase, the solar industry in India is still in its infancy and has not been able to emerge fully
 lihaaja ise urja kaa vyaavhaarik vikalp or laabhadaayak kaarobaar banane kii disha main abhi kaaphi chunautiyaan hai
 Arunabh Ghosh, director of the Center for Environment, Energy and Water, says, "we need more involvement of the private equity market in this sector, which will pave the way for institutional investors to invest their money in these projects
" sarkaar ko bhi solar kaa dayera or vistrut karnaa hoga or ruf top solar or awasaiya pariyojnaon par apana dhyaan kendrit karnaa hoga taaki bade str par yah kaamyaab ho sake
 "apart from the problems of investment, poor connectivity to the grid, expensive storage of electricity and lack of skilled people to work in these projects is also a major problem
 terry main energy envyranment tech deveopment ke nideshak shiris es
 "there are some obstacles in the path of solar energy," says Garun
 jaise ki ruf top solar pranali samet choti or madhyam str kii pariyojnaon ke liye paryaapt vittiya sansaadhan uplabdh karana or isse kahin zyada mahatvapurn kaam he kushal maanav sansaadhan jutanaa
 Many states have made various policies and regulations for the promotion of solar projects, but there is no way that the cost of installing solar panels will be reduced
 khaskar awasaiya gharon main chhaton par solar panel lagane kaa kharch acha-khaasaa he or yahi kaaran saura urja pariyojnaon kii raah main badi baadha he
 As far as storage of electricity is concerned, the challenges related to it are also not less
 bijli ke bhandaaran ke sawaal par arunabh ghosh jaise jaankaron kaa kahana he ki bharat ab bhi praudyogikeey vikaas se do-teen saal dur he
 But this problem will also be solved
 philhal saura urja kaa bhandaaran kaaphi mahangaa he or grid conequivity bhi kaaphi bikhri hui he, jiske chalate desh ke kuch hi hisson main saura urja vikalp ke taur par kargar sabit hui he
 In the words of Vikram Solar MD Gyanesh Choudhary, "studies show that solar cells made from India are less efficient than imported solar cells
" hamen aisi kisi bhi sthiti se bachane kii jarurat he, jo hamaare gharelu modul ko prabhavit kare yaa jisase uske tikaaupan par koi asar padataa ho kyonki pariyojna kii kul laagat kaa 60 fisadi to modul main hi chalaa jaataa he
 The quality of PV (photovoltaic cells, which directly generate power) modules used in solar plants will pave the way for India's solar ambitions in the long run
 niveshkon, vittposhkon or karjadaataaon ko pivi pranaaliyon se hi sabase zyada laabh hota he, lekin agar ye modul naakaam ho jaaen to iskaa sabase zyada jokhim bhi unhen hi uthaanaa hota he
 Therefore, it is needless to say that these modules should be of international standard and superior
 lekin philhal aisa nahin he
 Producers of solar equipment and components are also a little skeptical about this as the industry in India is still in its infancy
 welspan rinuables ke vaais chairman vineet mittal kehete hai, ''prastaavit jiesti navikarniya pariyojnaon par pratikul asar daal saktaa he
 The objective of GST is to bring equality in tax policies at the national and state level
 iske chalate ubharate hue navikarniya urja kshetra ko milane vaali koi bhi sabsidi samaapt ho jaaegi
 Experts estimate that the cost of new renewable projects will increase by 20 per cent with the implementation of GST
 ''ye hai rukaawateniske alaava bhi is raah main abhi kaaphi rukaawatein hai
 Non-cooperation from many states is also a major issue in giving land for projects
 jaankaron kaa kahana he ki aagaamee pariyojnaon ke liye centre ko rajyon ke saath milakar ek land bank nirmit karne kii disha main kaam karnaa chahie
 There are many challenges in this path
 lekin in sabake baavjood bharat saura kranti ke liye ek adarsh sthal he kyonki yahaan 29
 The area of 7 lakh square kilometers is tropical and subtropical and there is sufficient sunlight for 250 to 300 days in a year

 What were the previous results? In the last election, Shiv sena-bjp fought together
 shivasena ko 75 or bijepi ko 31 ward main jeet hasil hui thi

 ) bollywood kai baar samay ke saath kadamtal karne kii koshish karata najar aata he or vah acha vishay bhi uthaa letaa he
 But then at a time it seems that he is still the same and nothing has changed in him
 jab yah ehsaas hota he to bahut jhatka bhi pahunchataa he
 If someone who does this is a very well-behaved director and also one who has made a film like English Vinglish, like Gauri Shinde, then his expectations are doubled
 lekin'dear jindagi'par aakar gauri bahut buree tarah se niraash karti hai
 She is unable to give anything in the film that can be tied up and the film seems very slow and rotating in many angles from the beginning, and is unable to connect anywhere
 film main shahrukh khan achche lagate hai lekin vah sirf aalia bhatta ko sahaara dete najar aate hai
 The film is very weak in terms of script and speed is going to kill
 kahin-kahin aisi bhi lagata he ki jaise aadhunik yuvaaon ke jivan ko lekar vigyaapan dikhaaya ja rahaa ho, jisaki avadhi kuch zyada hi lambii khinch gai ho
 Alia Bhatt is such a modern-day girl in the story
 jise hangover kii tarah ishk hota he or jo ek jatke main utar bhi jaataa he
 She is modern in thoughts, and considers her friends only her world and life
 lekin ishk kaa shikaar hone ke baad jab vah tuutane lagati he to vah dimag ke doctor shahrukh khan ke paas pahunchati he or unki sharnaagat ban jaati he
 Then the game of doctor and patient starts
 shahrukh jab bhi aate hai to acha lagata he lekin unka role kuch aisa he jiskaa scope kuch zyada nahin he
 But Shahrukh manages to win hearts
 film main kasi hui script or kahani kaa abhaav he
 The same thing does not allow the film to get back on track, and the tone of the film is off all the time
 star apilalia bhatta acchhee adaakara he or unhen jis tarah kaa role diya gaya he, use behad khubasurat dhang se unhone nibhaayaa bhi he
 However, in between, she also seems to be the victim of over-acting, and it seems that the director does not understand what to do
 lekin kul milakar vah acchhee hai
 Shahrukh Khan is the plus point of the film but there is nothing in his hand to take the film to run
 ali jafar achche lagate hai, unki pregence bahut hi pyaari lagati he
 He played the character of the singer well
 baaki sabhi ausat hai
 The point of earning 'dear Zindagi' is a film made entirely in the focus of urban India, or a film of nature of multiplexes
 lekin in dinon notebandi ne tel nikaal rakhaa he, aise main yah dekhne vaali baat hogi ki thande tewaron vaali yah film darshakon ko kis had tak cinemagharon tak khinch paati he
 There is a lot of use of English till Shahrukh's arrival in the film, it is also realized that the director had already thought about not taking the film to the inner most parts of India
 aajkar jis tarah kii bollywood kii angrejidan filmein aa rahi hai, unase to aisa lagata he ki inhen dekhne ke liye bhi yogyata kahin bi

 'dear Zindagi' is a mediocre film, and the end compels me to sigh

 Desi liquor will also be ignored as IMFL (foreign liquor made in India)
 in sanshodhano se pehali baar jurm karne waalon ko police thane se hi jamaanat mil jaaegi
 Not only this, section 38 of the Bihar Prohibition and Excise Act 2016 is also expected to be withdrawn, which mandates 10 years in jail and a fine of Rs 10 lakh
 sanshodhano ke mutabik, aaropee shaks ke parivaar ke sadasyon ko bhi iske daayre se baahar kar diya jayega, jo maujuuda praavdhaanon ke tahat sajaaon ke paatr hai
 In the amended law, the provisions of confiscation of the property of the accused person will also be waived

 Due to Bihar's prohibition, 1,41,000 people have gone behind bars
 aamtaur par mana jaataa he ki jad (you) jahanabad or jokihat kii siten sharabbandi kanoon ke tahat daliton ke khilaaf kii gai police karrwai kii vajah se haara
 In fact, opposing leaders, especially former Chief Minister Jeetan Ram Manjhi, have been loudly saying how Dalits are facing the brunt of the state's prohibition law
 yah sach he ki sharabbandi kanoon ke tahat giraftaar kiye gaye logon main bahut badi taadaad anusuchit jatiyon or obisi ke logon kii he
 These sections are the support base of Janata Dal (U)
 haalanki yah baat bhi utani hi sach he ki sharabbandi ne tamaam jatiyon kii mahila votaron main nitish kii sthiti ko majboot kiya he
 Analysts say that women voters of Bihar have emerged as 'caste-neutral' supporters for the Chief Minister
 sharabbandi kii vajah se rajya main gharelu hinsa main kami ai he or pariwaron kii kharch karne laayak aamadani main ijapha hua he
 The state agencies have registered 1,17,000 cases under the prohibition law since April 5, 2016

 Actually, Aditi, who went to UK on a student visa, is about to expire after which she will not be able to live in the UK even if she plays for West Ham Ladies
 
 Team India goalkeeper Aditi, who came to read the UK, made a strong game, in August, on the basis of her ability, she won the contract to play for the Premier League team West Ham United Ladies

 aditi kaa club west ham naa to use vija de saktaa he or naa hi uske khel ke badale main use kisi tarah kaa koi bhugtan kar saktaa he
 In fact, according to the FA rules, the English Women's League club of third tier cannot pay their players in any way
 padhai tak to thik tha kyonki aditi uniwarsity ke hostel main rahati thi lekin landan main rent par rahanaa, khaanaa, travel karnaa kitna mahangaa he ye to kisi se chipa nahin he

 Hundreds of people have supported this campaign which started a few hours ago
 agar aap bhi aditi kii madad ke liye is pitishan par sin karnaa chaahate hai to islinkapar jaae

 input:iemdibi , vikipedia, gomolo After the big election defeat in four states, there was speculation that this would weaken the team Rahul within the Congress, on the contrary, the highly placed sources of the Congress claim that, nothing can be worse now, in such a time That is, a major reshuffle in the Congress and Rahul's coronation
 naam na chhapane kii shart par gandhi parivaar ke kareebi ek bade netaa ne kaha ki, chaar rajyon kii chunavi haar kaa congress sanghathan main hone vaale badlaav se yaa rahul kii tajposhi se koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 Rather, it will happen sooner than you might think
 kuch der baad hi isi tarj par congress kaa aadhikarik bayaan bhi aa gaya
 Party's media in-charge Randeep Surjewala said that the defeat should not be linked to the change in the organization, the party will decide by the time the time comes
 june-july main bade badlaav kii taiyaari
 
 
 By late June or early July, there are signs of a change in the party
 kai mahasachivon kii chuttee hogi or kai nae chehron ko jagah milegi
 According to sources, the young team will definitely get a place in the new team, but the team combination will have both new and old faces
 jinka cat saktaa he patta
 
 
 Sources claim that around 8 national general secretary level leaders may be discharged, including Ambika Soni, Mohan Prakash, Madhusudan Mistry, CP Joshi, BK Hariprasad, Mukul Wasnik and Gurudas Kamat
 saath hi sanghathan mahasachiv janardan dvivedi or punjab prabharee shakeel ahamed par aakhri faisla hona baaki he
 At the same time, Digvijay Singh is expected to retain the post of general secretary
 baat koshadhyaksh pad kii karen to umradraj netaa motilal vora ko bhi aaraam die jane par vichaar ho rahaa he
 The idea is to replace former Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot or Sushil Kumar Shinde
 is baavat sonia or rahul ke bich suchi kaa aadan-pradaan bhi shuru ho chukaa he
 Those who can get a place in the organization
 
 
 nai team main nae or puraane chehron ke sangyojan kaa khaas khyaal rakhaa ja rahaa he
 Many leaders of Team Rahul will be given secretary positions
 vahiin, mahasachiv str par kamalnath, bhupinder singh hooda, anand sharma jaise puraane netaaon ko jagah mil sakati he
 Also, if Sheila Dixit is not sent to UP, she will also be a strong contender for the post of party general secretary

 rahul kii tajposhi ke liye do vikalp
 
 ye to tay he ki, is saal rahul gandhi congress ke adhyaksh ban jaaenge lekin tajposhi kab ho, is par gandhi parivaar do vikalpon par vichaar kar rahaa he
 The first option is that Rahul be nominated as the president at the end of the month or early July, along with a change in the party in June, and then later in October he will be elected as the president in a possible election of the organization
 doosraa vikalp ye he ki abhi party main badlaav kar die jaaen, anaupchaarik taur kaam rahul dekhen or kuch maheenon main nai team ke saath wo talmail baitha len, jiske baad oktober main sonia gandhi adhyaksh pad se istipha de den or phir sanghathan chunaav me rahul adhyaksh kaa chunaav ladakar kursi sanbhaalein
 Overall, after consecutive defeats, now the Congress is ready to make changes in its organization soon, but with the streak that defeat or victory will be its next president Rahul Gandhi and this year

 (vishesh input bhashaa se) There has been a stir in the cricket world ever since Anil Kumble's sudden resignation as the head coach of Team India
 bhartiya captain viraat kohli se hue vivaad ke chalate kumble ko istipha dena padaa
 But do you know what Virat Kohli had to resign Anil Kumble because of what Kumble said about him two years ago
 ham aapako bataate hai ki kumble ne viraat ko lekar kya kaha tha
 Actually, during a conversation in India Today's program Mind Rocks, Kumble named Dhoni and Kohli as two of Team India's best captains
 dhoni or kohli donon hi team india ke best captainek sawaal poochne par ki maujuuda bhartiya team main do captain hai, viraat kohli (test captain) or emes dhoni (vanade captain), donon main koun safal captain hai
 Replying to this, Kumble said that the Indian team has two good captains
 dhoni maujuuda team main achche kaamyaab captain hai
 He has won two World Cups, won the Champions Trophy and also made Team India number one in Tests
 dhoni ke baad viraat kohli ne team india kii kaman sambhaal lee
 Virat Kohli has won the Test series on the Sri Lanka tour and also performed well in Sri Lanka
 hamaare paas pehle hi do safal captain he, to tisare captain kii koi zarurat nahin he
 Right now Dhoni and Kohli are captaining very well
 lucky captain tha jo sahvaag jaisaa khilaadi meri team main thajab kumble ko ye bataaya gaya ki virendra sahvaag ne kaha he aap sabase best captain the jab wo aapaki captaini main khelte the
 To this, Kumble said that i was a very lucky captain, a player like Sehwag was in my team
 jab hamane 2008 main australian daure ke liye team chuni thi
 At that time, Sehwag was not in form and was also not a part of the Indian team
 lekin jab unhen team main chunaa gaya to uske baad sahvaag ne peeche mud kar nahin dekha or wo shatak, dohare shatak yahaan tak ki tisare shatak bhi banane lage
 Virat Brigade's comeback after a one-day loss to South Africa was a spectacular 2015 when South Africa's team visited India when they defeated Team India in the ODI series
 jiske baad bhartiya team ne viraat kohli kii captaini main south africa ko 3-0 se shikast di thi
 On this, Kumble said that after losing in the ODI series, Team India performed brilliantly under the captaincy of Virat Kohli
 team india ne vanade siries main haar kii yaadon ko bhula kar dhamaakedaar vaapasi kii thi
 In his Dream XI, Kohli was replaced by Anil Kumble when a fan asked him to choose his all-time ODI XI, then Kumble replaced Virat Kohli in his All Time ODI team's Dream XI
 viraat kohli ke alaava kumble ne emes dhoni ko bhi apni team main chunaa
 Significantly, Anil Kumble was given the responsibility of the post of coach only in June 2016
 pichley din hi unka anubandh samaapt hua tha, lekin board ne unhen westeindies daure tak bane rahane ko kaha tha
 However, Kumble resigned from his post, deciding not to go to the Windies
 anil kumble ne twit karke iskaa kaaran bataaya he
 He has written that the BCCI told him that the captain of the team has problems with his style of work

 Or rather, for the last two decades, this word was mentioned so many times that people started feeling stale
 is udaasi kii ek vajah yah bhi thi ki log is shabd ko to sunate the, lekin iskaa asli asar un tak pahunchataa nahin tha

 Ramadan says, 'sanskrit is not a religious language

 i want to tell everyone this
 bharat ke logon ke saath-saath baahar ke logon ko bhi is vishay or is bhashaa ko siikhnaa chahie
 Ramadan says that his religion did not come in the way of teaching his Sanskrit even for once
 shuruuaat main unhen mantrocchar seekhney main pareshaani aati thi, lekin baad main unke liye yah aasaan ho gaya or ve ise anya kitabon kii tarah padhane lage
 Dealing with the BHU issue, however, they feel that the anger of students of Banaras Hindu University should be dealt with differently in protest against the appointment of a Sanskrit teacher

 i think it would be good if Feroze Khan compromises with the committee there
 'haal hi main banaras hindu uniwarsity (biechayu) ke sanskrit vibhaag main ek muslim firoz khan kii associat professor ke rup main niyukti hui to chaatro kaa ek group is niyukti ke virodh main dharne par baith gaya
 The students were protesting against reading the Muslim customs portion of the curriculum from a Muslim teacher

 up mukhyamantri tejasvi yadav ne modi ke bayaan kaa vistaar se jawaab diya he
 He has told Modi that he is misleading BJP workers by telling them to break the alliance so that they can keep going around them
 tejasvi yadav ne kaha he ki susheel modi ji ne kal kaha ki lalu prasad ji main himmat nahin he ki ve gathbandhan tod den
 Laugh at his words
 himmat kii baat bhi susheel modi us shaks se kar rahe hai jisane lagaataar teen dashak se bhaajapa kii nakaaratmak raajnneeti ke mansoobon ko ronda he
 The same Lalu Prasad, like Angad, has constantly saved Bihar from the Sanghi fire
 susheel modi jaraa us suurama kaa naam to bataaen jisane adwani ke sampradayik rath kaa chakkaa jam kar diya? desh main kiske paas thi itani himmat? usee rathyatra ke prabandhak narendra modi jab do dashak baad apni sari takat jhonkkar bihar jeetne aae to kisne apni himmat se unke saare sapanom ko masal diya? Tejashwi has told Sushil Modi that where does your courage get lost when Advani, despite being in the camp, is seen standing in the palace of flattering modi-shah today even after drinking a sip of blood to save his politics? Hey, Himmati is the one who ends up fighting the odds, for the principles, eats dry bread but doesn't play flattering bean
 himmat kya hoti he yah aap kya jaane? jab narendra modi ke sammaan main yojit bhoj ko radd kiya gaya to aapaki himmat kahaan vicharan kar rahi thi? agar himmat thi to, tod dete gathbandhan

 He has told Modi that the grand alliance is going on with fun, you mislead BJP leaders and activists by talking of breaking the alliance so that they keep hovering around you and your paper strength is not reduced

 Quit the cream of power! up mukhyamantri ne kaha he ki susheel modi ji, adwani kheme kaa hone kaa yah matlab to nahin ki party ke netaaon kaa paksh bhi na len?tippaniyan If you had the courage, then why did not you resign from the party on the charge of distributing tickets by taking money from your MP and other leaders? Why did you not respond to the genuine anger of Giriraj Singh and Ashwini Chaubey in the Lok Sabha elections? Why do facts and facts not answer the legitimate and logical allegations of Bhola Singh, Kirti Azad, Gopal Narayan Singh and Shatrughan Sinha? Positive people speak of courage, not negative

 It is alleged through the documents that came out that senior advocate Ram Jethmalani in the petition filed in the court on behalf of Arvind Kejriwal has described this defamation case as a private case

 At the same time, the Aam Aadmi Party is claiming with documents in this whole case that this entire case is private because Arun Jaitley has filed his personal defamation case as an ordinary citizen and not as the Finance Minister of the country

 Ashutosh, an accused and Aam Aadmi Party leader in Arun Jaitley's defamation case, said, "this case may be of personal instinct on behalf of Arun Jaitley as he has defamation case not as finance minister but as a common citizen but it He has made a case against the Chief Minister of Delhi

 Not only this, the Aam Aadmi Party is referring to the reply given by Arun Jaitley in Delhi High Court in which Jethmalani asked Arun Jaitley that when Madhu Kishwar made the same allegations, then why only sue Kejriwal and Madhu Kishwar? On the answer to this question, Arun Jaitley had said that Arvind Kejriwal is the Chief Minister of Delhi and is in constitutional post, in which case his allegations are more serious and more serious
 "is puure maamle main janata ke tex ke paison ke durupyog ke aarope ke baad aam aadmi party is mudde ko kathithiviem ghotalese dhyaan bhatakaane kii koshish kaa aarope laga rahi he
 Aam Aadmi Party leader Ashutosh alleged that the entire case was an attempt to divert attention from the EVM scam
