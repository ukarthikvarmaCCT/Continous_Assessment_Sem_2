 Like she was an old Kajali whom all of them went after getting entangled in thorns
 aman va shaanti kii khoj main, rupee ke chaar ser gehun ke peeche or vah nanheen-nanheen hastiyon kii pyaari-pyaari aa-gu-aa-gu se cameraa ab tak goonj rahaa tha
 She ran with a lap in the room, but her lap remained empty
 vah god jise suhaaginen pavitrataa se chhukar haath kokh ko lagaati thim aaj khaali thi
 The room was lying vacant vahshat se vah laut gayin
 But could not return the imagined steps
 vah duusare kamare main ladkadaa gayin
 It was here that the spouse turned his face after spending fifty years
 yaheen darwanje ke saamne kafan main lipati laash rakhi gayi thi, sara parivaar ghere khadaa tha
 Those with luck were those who left their spouse on the side in the lap of their love
 jo aaj bekafan kii laash kii tarah laavaaris pad gayi
 The feet answered and sat down where the trembling hands lit the lamp for several years at the head of Meet
 par aaj chiraag main tel na tha or batti bhi samaapt ho chuki thi
 Roopchand was walking fast in his verandah in front
 gaaliyaan de rahe the apane bivi-bacchon ko, naukaron ko, sarkaar ko or apane saamne faili viraan sadak ko, eent-pathar ko, chaaku-chhuri ko, yahan tak ki puraa vishwa inaki gaaliyon kii bambaari ke aage saham gaya tha
 And especially this empty house which was standing on the other side of the road was teasing them
 jaise swayan inhone apane haathon se isaki eent se eent baja di ho
 He wanted to knock something out of his brain
 puri shakti kii madad se nonchakar phenk dena chaahate the
 But sitting unsuccessfully, annoyed
 kapat kii jadon kii tarah jo cheez inke astitv main jam chuki thi vah use puri shakti se khinch rahe the magar saath-saath jaise inkaa maance khinchaa chalaa aata ho, vah karaah kar chhod dete the
 Then suddenly his abuses stopped
 tahal tham gayi or wo motor main baithkar chal diye
 night fell
 jab gali ke nukkad par sannata chaa gaya to pichley darwanje se rupachand ji kii patni do parosi hui thaliyaan upar neeche rakhe choron kii tarah andar aayin
 Both old women sat face to face in silence
 jubaanen band raheen par ankhen sab kuch kah rahi thim
 The food of both the plates was kept like a tree
 auraten jab kisi kii chugali karti hai to inaki jubaanen kainchiyon kii tarah nikal padati 
 But where the emotions attacked and locks in the mouth
 raat bhar na jane kitni der tak yaaden akelaa paakar achaanak hamalaa karti raheen
 Do not know that everything should be finished on the way
 aajkal to puri-puri railen cat rahi hai
 Fifty years of watering had prepared farming and today, they had gone out of their country in search of a new earth, who knows what new earth did not come to these plants, the wretches would not go to these poor plants
 choti bahu kaa to puraa maheenaa he na jane kis jangal main jaccha ghar bane
 Home, family, job, business left everything
 nae desh main
 The eagles must have left something
 yaa munh takate hi laut aayenge or jo lautakar aaen to phir se jaden pakadaney kaa mauka milegaa bhi yaa nahinkun jane yah budhiya unke laut aane tak jivit rahegi bhi ki nahin
 Amma became a stone idol
 neend kahan, sari raat boodha sharir betiyon kii kati-fatty laashen, noujvaan bahuon kaa nanga juluus or poton-navaason ke chithde udate dekh kar tharrata rahaa
 Do not know when the nap attacked
 aisa prathit hua darwanje par duniya bhar kaa hangaamaa ho rahaa he
 Lovely life is not right, but even without extinguishing the lamp of oil, a tremor arises, and what a simple death is less merciless, which comes from above as a ghost of human being
 suna he boodhiyon tak ko bal pakad kar sadakon par ghasitate hai
 Even the skin peeled is visible to the bones, and then the wonders of the world are revealed, which only make the angels of hell turn yellow
 dastak kii ghangaraj badhati ja rahi thi
 Yamraj was in a hurry and then all the chitkings started opening, the lights started burning like someone's voice came from the bottom of the well
 shaayad bada ladkaa pukaar rahaa tha, nahin ye to chote or manjhale kii aawaaj thi duusari duniya ke dhwast kone se
 So everyone got their own country? so early? Twilight, small, clean were standing behind him, daughters-in-law carrying children
 phir ekadam se sara ghar jivit ho uthaa, sari atmaaen jaag uthin or dukhiyaari maan ke aas-paas jamaa hone lageen
 Small and big hands started to touch with love
 sookhe honton main ekaek konpalein foot nikaleen
 Happily all the senses dispersed and drowned in the darkness
 jab aankh khuli to ragon par jaani-pahachaani ungliyaan reng rahi thim
 "oh sister-in-law call me that way, i will come
 ye dhong kaahe ko rachaati ho'', rupachand ji parde ke peeche se kah rahe the
 '' And get the fee today
 dekho tumhaare nalayak ladakon ko loni jankshan se pakad laayaa hum
 The crooks used to run away from somewhere
 police superritendent kaa bhi vishwaas nahin karte the
 Then the buds came out in the old lips
 vah uthakar baith gayin
 She kept quiet for a while
 phir do garm-garm moti ludhak kar rupachand ji ke jhurriyon bhare haath par gir pade

 ' CBI detailed project report of the proposed five-star hotel from Bhadbhada Road, headquarters of Madhya Pradesh Tourism Corporation, recently in connection with the murder of RTI activist Shehla Masood
 deepiar
 Has seized documents of beuro ke sutron ke anusaar ye dastavej jaanch ke liye jald hi dilli sthit sibiai kii aparaadh shakha ko bheje jaayenge
 It is noteworthy that Shehla had sought information under the RTI regarding this project and objections had been lodged in several departments regarding this project, due to which the project was in a ditch
 gyatavya he ki isi saal 16 agast ko shahala masood kii us samay agyaat vyakti dwaara goli markar hatya kar di gayi thi jab vah kohefija kshetra sthit awaas se nikalakar apni car main baith rahi thi
 CBI has been investigating this case for the last five months but it has not been able to find any important clues till date
 is maamle main abhi tak ek sau se adhik logon se poochtacha kii ja chuki he
 The craze of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi began with the capture of Iraq and some cities in Syria
 in do deshon ke kuch shaharon par kabja karne ke baad hi usne puri duniya par kabje karne kaa sapana dekha tha
 And then did bloodshed in many countries
 magar ab jis tarah se ek ke baad ek uske qile dhah rahe hai, wo is baat kaa ishaara he ki iesas kii kahani bahut jald khatm hone vaali he
 On the front of the war, ISIS is seeing one outback after another
 aankadon kii baat karen to aies kaa 2014 tak iraq or syria ke bade hisse par kabza tha
 But in the last 11 months, 50 per cent of the is-occupied has been taken out of its hands
 vahiin syria main bhi use 20 fisadi hissaa ganvaana padaa he
 After losing Iraq's big cities Ramadi, Tikrit, Sinjar and now Faluja, IS has broken its back
 america kii aguwai main nato fouj ke hawaii hamalon ne jahaan iraq main aies ke naak main dam kar rakhaa he vahiin rus hawaii hamalon ne syria main aies kaa jeena muhaal kar diya he
 This condition of the notorious terrorist organization ISIS happened because it is surrounded by all four sides
 jahaan iraq ke mosul main ek taraf kurdon se iesas kii jang chal rahi he
 At the same time, the Iraqi army and the US attacks are also facing them
 duusari taraf syria kii baat karen to raashtrapati asad kii fouj bhi iesas par joardaarahamalekar rahi he
 Even Russia, who calls Assad his friend, is not in a mood to spare the IS, only then the strong air strikes in Syria have diluted the condition of this terrorist organization
 aies ke kabze se faluja shahar bhi aaazaad ho chukaa he
 There is now some area of mosul in Iraq under the occupation of IS, while in Syria too, only the IS capital Raqqa and some surrounding areas are left in the possession of Baghdadi
 in sabhi halaaton ko dekhakar saaf ho gaya he ki bagdadi kii barbaadi ke din behad kareeb hai
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has bluntly told his ministers that they will not consent to appointments to important posts of recommended people
 unka kahana he ki pichhali upie sarkaar main kuch vibhaagon main jis tarah se niyuktiyon main dhaandhlee hui use ab khatm kar diya jayega
 An economic newspaper reported this
 patr ke mutabik yah niti isliye banaai ja rahi he ki sarkaar ke agle paanch saal ke kaaryakramon ko karyanvit karne ke liye sahi team taiyaar ho jaae
 The government is therefore placing more emphasis on merit
 5 sitambar ko sabhi vibhaagon ko ek patr bheja gaya tha jisamen merit par jor dene ko kaha gaya tha
 This was because the names of many people were recommended without merit
 us patr main kaha gaya he ki niyuktiyon ke liye vibhinn mantralayon se bheje gaye kai maamalon main dekha ja rahaa he ki sellection kamity ummidavaaron ke naam merit ke aadhaar par nahin bhej rahi he
 The new government is not believed in ad hoc appointments unlike the UPA government
 vah chaahati he ki mahatvapurn padon par merit vaale logon ko tarjeeh di jaae
 There was a lot of pull in appointments in the previous government and merit was sidelined

 ganguli ne turant hi viru se kaha ki dekh aath ran ban gaye hai ab sanbhal kar khel
 But Veeru again went for a sweep shot on the third ball but when the ball was off the stumps, he played in slip
 ek baar phir chaukaa
 Now Ganguly said to Veeru, 'you take the game straight
 ’iske baad agali hi gend jo middle stump par thi us par viru ne flik kiya or gend scawair leg ke upar se boundry ke liye chali gai
 Now Ganguly's patience broke
 unhone uske baad viru kii ore dekha hi nahin or usase gusse main kaha, ‘tuje jo karnaa he wo kar lekin agar out ho gaya to lords se sidhaa india bhej duungaa, tu hotel bhi nahin ja paaegaa

 - Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) February 12, 2015 team india ke nae head coach ravi shastri mangalvaar ko bisisiai kii cricket salaahkaar samiti (siesi) dwaara is hai profile pad par niyukt kiye jane ke baad bahut utsahit najar aa rahe hai
 Ravi Shastri will join the team from the tour of Sri Lanka and will be with the team till the World Cup 2019
 ravi shastri ne coach banate hi purv bhartiya captain em es dhoni or yuvaraj singh ke bhavishya par bada bayaan diya he
 Long time in the World Cup, when dhoni-yuvi Champion Ravi Shastri was asked about the playing of MS Dhoni and Yuvraj Singh in the 2019 World Cup, he said, 'there is still a long time left in the 2019 World Cup
 Huh
 maine pehle bhi kaha hai or ek baar phir se kahata hum ki is baat main koi shaq nahin he ki mahendra singh dhoni or yuvaraj singh champion khilaadi hai
 i am going to make a fresh start right now and for this i will have to spend a long time with the team players as well as the captain
 ’yen bhi padhein, nae coach shastri bole- sachin ke kehane par nahin kiya tha applishasthri ne aage kaha, main phir se dressing room kaa hissaa banane ja rahaa hum, isliye mujhe captain ke saath kuch samay bitaane or chizon ko aage badhaane ke liye kuch samay chahie
 We will deal with it when the time comes
 ’ aapako bataa den ki em es dhoni kaa pradarshan to thik hi rahaa he lekin yuvaraj singh khaasaa kharaab form main hai
 He did not bat in the West Indies after the Champions Trophy after which many veterans questioned his being in the team
 ab dekhnaa ye he ki ravi shastri ke coach banane ke baad wo yuvaraj singh or em es dhoni par kya faisla lete hai
 Also read, there is no place for yuvraj-dhoni in Shastri era? It may be difficult for Ashwin too, players will get freedom
 Apart from this, Ravi Shastri said that, he wants to start a new beginning
 iske liye wo team ke khilaadiyon ko or bhi aazaadee denge or unki maansik takat par kaam karne ke saath-saath unka aatmavishvaas bhi badhayenge
 Along with this, he said that i will not tamper with the style of the existing players
 kyonki bade str par aapako bahut koching kii aavashyaktaa hoti he or zyada badlaav kii bhi jarurat nahin hoti

 team anna kii kor cameti kii baithak main hangaame ke baad somvaar ko anna hajaare apane gaanv ralegan siddhi ke liye ravaanaa ho gaye
 Anna said that talk of the meeting was being leaked with the help of mobile, which is not correct
 ramdev ke saath saajha andolan karne par anna ne kaha ki ham saath nahin ghumenge, lekin alag−alag andolanon main ek jagah mulaakaat hoti he, to unhen ramdev ke saath manch saajha karne main koi aapatti nahin he
 Both the movements are against corruption and he supports Baba Ramdev's movement on the issue of black money
 tippaniyan It was only after the meeting of Team Anna's core committee that it was clear that Anna and Baba Ramdev would not run a joint campaign, but instead they would help each other when needed
 isse pehle shuukravaar ko anna or ramdev kii saajha press conference se laga tha ki anna or ramdev saath aa gaye hai or sarkaar ke khilaaf milakar andolan chalaayenge, lekin ravivaar ko sab kuch palat gaya
 Actually, after Anna Hazare and Baba Ramdev's shared press conference and the announcement of fighting together, differences had increased in Team Anna, after which this middle ground has been found
 ravivaar ko hui team anna kii kor cameti kii baithak kaaphi hangaamedaar rahi
 The uproar began when the committee member Mufti Shamim Kasami was asked to leave the meeting
 team anna ne mufti par aarope lagaaya ki vah meeting main chal rahi baton kii recording kar rahe the
 Mufti, who came out of the meeting very angry, said that he has been wrongly accused, so he is separated from Anna's movement, and also said that Team Anna has been hijacked by Arvind Kejriwal and Manish Sisodia and they Running Team Anna like a dictator
 team anna kii kor cameti kii baithak ke baad hi yah saaf ho gaya tha ki anna or baba ramdev saajha abhiyaan nahin chalaayenge, balki jarurat padane par donon ek-duusare kii madad karenge
 Earlier on Friday, Anna and Ramdev's shared press conference felt that Anna and Ramdev have come together and will organize a movement against the government, but on Sunday everything reversed
 darasal anna hajaare or baba ramdev kii saajha press conference or saath−saath ladane ke elaan ke baad team anna main matbhed bad gaye the, jiske baad hi yah bich kaa rasta nikaala gaya he
 Team Anna's core committee meeting on Sunday was very ruckus
 hangaamaa us vakt shuru hua, jab cameti ke sadsy mufti samim kaasmi ko baithak se baahar jane ke liye kaha gaya
 Team Anna accused the mufti that he was recording the things going on in the meeting
 meeting se behad gusse main baahar aae mufti ne kaha ki un par galat aarope lagaae gaye hai, isliye vah anna ke andolan se alag ho gaye hai, saath hi unhone kaha ki team anna ko arvind kejariwal or manish sitaudiya ne hijank kar liya he or ve kisi taanashaah kii tarah team anna ko chalaa rahe hai

 Exactly one hundred years ago, when India was struggling for its identity, Gandhi was explaining the Swadeshi not only to Indians but also to the British
 agast ke isi maheene main vah garvanar se milakar swadeshi par lambii baatcheet karne ke liye vakt maang rahe the
 When he did not get time, he took the assistant of Governor M

 In writing a long letter to Combi, he also presented his ideas about Swadeshi and the rationale behind those ideas
 sau saal ke vikaas ke baad aaj jab har din bazaar main mandi kii khabaren hamen daraati hai, har din naukari jane kii khabaren akhbaar ke pannon par andar dar-darkar, chipa-chhipaakar chhaapi jaati hon, share bazaar ke uthati-girti rekhaon se dhadakanen saamaanya gati se nahin chal rahi hon, un paristhitiyon main kya keval sarkaar ke raahat package bhar ko ek uchit ilaaj mana janaa chahie, jaisaa vittamantri nirmala sitaraman ne do din pehle prastut kiya or girte bazaar ko raahat dene kii koshish kii
 Certainly, in today's circumstances, Gandhi's talk of a hundred years ago may seem irrelevant to you, but even if you are not confident about strengthening your economy today, even after adopting capitalism, then you must also think that Gandhi hundred years ago What were you saying? 25 agast, 1919 ko angrej adhikari em

 combi ko likhe patr main gandhi kaa kahana tha ki swadeshi kaa matlab unke liye yah he ki bharat kii jarurat bhar kaa kapadaa taiyaar karnaa or uskaa samuchit vitaran karnaa
 This includes encouraging domestic production and persuading people to take an oath that they will wear indigenous, and continue to wear as many foreign clothes as they need, not dismiss them altogether
 iske aage unki soch thi ki swadeshi keval aarthik or dharmik pahaluon tak simit na rahe
 He was also looking at the possibilities of high moral level political consequences, which was the greatest need at that time
 is patr ke aasapaas ke vakt ko dekhen to in vichaaron ke aasapaas ke kaam aapako samaj main aaenge hi
 Here, a hundred years of development have told us that everything is not better
 aazaadee ke sattar saalon main bhi gandhi kii kalpana kaa bharat bahut peeche chhot gaya he, jo haashiye par he, vah haashiye par hi padaa he
 We are beaten in the Global Hunger Index and the total wealth of India is also in a few hands
 shiksha or swasthya nijee kshetra main lagbhag pahunch chuke hai, ab jiske paas paisa he, usee ko acchhee shiksha or acha ilaaj uplabdh he, varanaa nahin
 Inclusive growth, Antyodaya is only in speeches, India has not been able to do exactly as it should have been in the ground conditions
 yah keval kuch saalon kii yaa kisi ek rajnatik dal kii baat bhi nahin he
 If Gandhi was looking at an industry in Swadeshi, in Charkha, which complements agriculture and has sufficient capacity to generate employment, it also includes a solution to deal with situations like famine, we are seeing the condition of that industry Huh
 krishi kii haalat to vaise hi is mukaam tak aa gai he ki hindustan main kisaan hone kaa matlab ek laachaar vyakti hona he, jise satta kii takat har chunavi saal main karjamaafee kaa lolypaap khilaakar agle chaar saal bhul jaati he
 He is promised to double his income, but it is not told how he will be
 kisaan aatmahatyaayein chaalu rahati hai or krishi se bade paimaane par kisaan baahar hote rahete hai
 In such a situation, it does not become relevant to stop and think about Gandhi's Swadeshi
 aise samay main, jab america raashtrapati tak chini saamaan ko apane desh se baahar karne kaa elaan kar rahe hon, us vakt main kya ham bhi apane desh or samaaj ke prati package dene se alag kuch soch sakate hai, kar sakate hai
 This is even more possible in today's time because the country is paramount to the people, the spirit of nationalism is flowing around and Narendra Modi is representing it historically
 modi ji ne gandhi ke chashme se swatchta ko aitihaasik rup se ek mudda bana diya, gaanv-gaanv main shauchalay sthapit bhi ho gaye, kya swatchta se ek kadam aage badhaakar ab swadeshi ko nae sandabhon main nahin parkhaa janaa chahie
 What Gandhi was telling the solution to all the difficulties and which our seventy years of independence did not even consider properly, should we do it once
 nishchit taur par yah kaam chand gandhivadi sansthaaen yaa log nahin kar sakate, uske liye ek majboot rajnatik ichhashakti kii jarurat padegi, vah is vakt sambhav he

 The Indian side is making such claims to divert attention from its attack on the Pakistani post

 rajya main duusari samasyaayein bhi sir uthaae hue hai

 yahi baat ambani ne bhi kahi
 Mitra said that the state's gross domestic product (GDP) at the time of the Trinamool government came to power was Rs 500 billion in 2010-11

 The impact was so severe that some industry leaders were wondering in 2011 whether Bengal's connection with the world of business and business would be broken

 In 2008 Infosys started investing to develop a SEZ on 50 acres at Rajarhat

 The investment was informed but the project came to a standstill as the Mamta government refused to approve any SEZ
 chah saal guzar gaye
 Finally, in September last year, an agreement was reached between the company and the government that a large IT sector company would pursue the project without SEZ identification, but it could use it for some other purpose by freeholding 51% of the acquired land
 apane duusare kaarykaal main mamata udyog samarthak chhavi banane kii koshish main dikhti hai
 For example, one of the reasons for Mittal's arrival at the Bengal Summit of 2018 was that Mamta herself had taken the responsibility of inviting him during the London tour

 At the summit, Mamta left no stone unturned in convincing the industrialists that the doors of Bengal were open for business
 unhone kaha, ''hamaare sundar ghar bengal or hamen apana samajhen

 ''baaten badboli lag sakati hai lekin maahaul main garmjoshi thi, isamen koi do raay nahin
 By the way, industrialists have made huge investment proposals in Bengal Global Summit, these include important sectors like manufacturing and infrastructure, small and medium industries, textile sector, health, tourism, education, food processing and IT
 haalanki yah dekhnaa abhi baaki he ki mamata kii udyogikaran kii koshishen kitna rang laati hai
 From now until the end of his term, land will have to be acquired for large scale industries
 trinmul sarkaar kaa tarika yah he ki sarkari madad yaa nigahabaani main jameen khariden

 idhar syria ke aasmaan se rocket ne gas choda or udhar dekhte hi dekhatesaikadon log usee palmaut kii agosh main samaa gaye
 No one else, but the Syrian president himself, had ordered the rain from the sky to rain this most dreadful death
 insaanon kii banaai is duniya main insaanon ke hi haathon banaae gaye is khaufnak hathiyaar yani rasinic bam ko apane hi logon par giraane kaa hukum unka apana hi netaa de rahaa tha
 It is suspected that Syria is the largest chemical weapon in the world and the people of Syria are currently on the streets against their own leader and the leaders of the same people are poisoning them from the sky to crush the voice of the people on the same road
 21 agast 2013, subah ke kareeb 5 bajepichley do saalon se grihayuddh kii aag main jhulas rahe is mulk ne buudhvaar kii subah jab apni ankhen kholi, to hawa main ghulti maut unka intjaar kar rahi thi
 Here, one rocket after another led to several attacks on the towns, and there settlements began to be transformed into crematoriums
 begunaah or bekhbar log til-til kar maut ke munh main jane lage
 What children, old and young, this attack spared no one
 isse pehle ki log samaj pate ki ye maajaraa kya he, kisi kii saans ruk gai to kisi kii ankhon ke saamne andhera chaa gaya
 Because this attack is not a minor attack, but was the most dreaded chemical attack in the world after 1980
 wo hamalaa, jisane takreeban dedh hajaar se zyaada logon kii jaan le lee
 a large Syrian population has been on the streets for a long time against the then President Bashar al-assad, but he will have to pay such a price for the President's opposition, which was not even thought by anyone
 iljaam he ki sarkaar ke ishaare par sena ne bich shahar main jahrili gaison se las rocket daage or palak jhapakate puure damishq main koharaam much gaya
 Bullets and explosions are not new to the Syrian people, who have been involved in a war of right and wrong for years, but what happened on Wednesday morning has never happened before
 logon ne abhi apane bistar chode hi the ki tabhi rocket se nikali jahrili gas ne unka dam ghontna shuru kar diya
 The first effect of this attack was that people started having trouble breathing
 tej jalan ke maare ankhon ke saamne andhera chaane laga, putaliyaan choti hone lagi or zyaadaatar log das minute ke andar maut ke munh main samaa gaye
 The worst is the case of children, who before they understand something, have moved away from the world
 jin logon kii haalat thodi behatar thi, unhone biimaar logon ko aspataal pahanchana shuru kiya or dekhte hi dekhte shahar ke tamaam chode-bade aspataal rasinic hamale ke shikaar logon se pat gaye
 The doctors' hands and feet swelled up
 haalat ye ho gai ki ye samaj aana mushkil ho gaya ki wo kiskaa ilaaj karen or kise choden or isi aanan-faanan main kai or jindagiyaan khamosh ho gayi
 This reality of Syria probably would not have been revealed to the world so soon, if the people there had not uploaded the videos of this destruction on social networking sites
 haalanki aaj tak ke liye in video kii tasdik karnaa mumkin nahin he, lekin sachai yahi he ki inhen video ne duniya kaa dhyaan ek baar phir syria kii taraf khinchaa he
 Air raids and explosions have become a part of Syria's life, but this time the rulers of this country used the weapon against their own people, he piled such a corpse of corpses as never in recent times
 maut kaa manjar shaayad itnaa bhayanak nahin hota, agar rasinic hathiyaar ke taur par hamalaavaron ne duniya ke sabase khatarnaak gaison main se ek kaa istemaal naa kiya hota or ye gas thi cerin
 In just 30 to 10 minutes, this gas, which wastes the entire nervous system of humans, is known by another name of death in the world
 bina kisi rang or bu vaali is gas kii khaasiyat ye he ki hawa ke mukaable baari hoti he or isi vajah se ek baar phija main is gas ke ghul jane par insaan ke paas bachane kaa koi rasta hi nahin hota
 This time when the same serine gas was attacked by rockets in and around Damascus, innocent people chose the way they often chose to escape and that was the way to be underground
 yani jameen ke andar kisi basament main jaakar chhip janaa lekin logon kii yahi naadaani abaki unke liye maut kii vajah sabit hui
 Due to the weight, serine gas reached the people hidden in the basement very easily and their own whereabouts proved to be gas chambers for the people
 pehle to logon ko samaj main hi nahin aayaa ki akhir ye hua kya, lekin jab tak gas ne asar dikhaanaa shuru kiya, to logon ko sanbhalane kaa mauka hi nahin mila
 The situation became such that, like insects and insects, humans started facing death
 sabase buree haalat mahilaon or bacchon kii hui or is hamale main logon kaa ilaaj karanevaale kai doctor tak bemaut maare gaye
 The condition became so bad that many of the doctors who had the responsibility of giving life, started crying themselves after seeing the scene of death
 ek doctor ne bataaya ki unhone khud apane haathon se kareeb 50 bacchon kii laashen uthaain
 One special thing about this dreaded gas named Serine was that it did not show any trace in the body on the upper side, but this gas inside became the cause of death for hundreds of people
 damishq se shuru hue is koharaam ne ab puure syria ko apni jad main le liya tha
 Some had difficulty in breathing, some of the eyes of the effigy were getting smaller and some of the body was swollen
 ye haal ke saalon main syria main hue sabase khaufnak rasinic hamale kaa asar tha
 The attack that the government itself committed against its own people
 syria kii asad sarkaar ke khilaaf vipakshi partiyon ne jab rasinic hathiyaaron ke istemaal kaa ilzaam pehali baar lagaaya, to duniya ne is par aasaani se yakeen nahin kiya lekin jaise hi ye video soshal cites par aplod hue, puri duniya sakate main aa gai
 When Stephen Johnson, a visiting fellow at the Cranfield Forensic Institute in London, watched these videos of Damascus closely, he felt that such a human condition could only happen if the nervous system malfunctioned and was possible in the case of a chemical attack
 vaise exparts jis cerin gas kii baat kah rahe hai, wo kitna khatarnaak he, iskaa andaaza sirf isi baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki isaki ek ounce bhi jism main pad jane par insaan kii maut mumkin he
 If not treated, its victim can be killed in just 10 minutes
 dam ghut saktaa he or yahaan tak ki insaan ko lakva tak maar jaataa he
 Now obviously, when the attack is so dreadful, the world is bound to get restless about it and after this attack the United Nations itself has taken this matter very seriously and is now monitoring the whole matter
 shuukravaar ko abhinayta deepak tijori internet par trend karne lage
 There were reports that after 26 years of marriage he came to know that his wife Shivani Joshi and his marriage were not legally valid
 deepak se jude kareebi sutron ne spotboy ko bataaya ki vah goregaanv sthit apane ghar ke keval ek kamare kaa istemaal kar sakate hai or shivani ne naukaron ko unhen khaanaa na dene or unke kamare kii safai na karne kii sakht hidaayat di he

 He said, "obviously someone is giving such reports in the press so that the court can be influenced by it
" donon ke talaak kaa maamla court main he or guzaara bhatte ke liye setlement bhi hona he
 Is it possible that after 26 years of married life, a person realizes that his marriage has no meaning? We are not concerned with such reports, the court will take its decision based on the evidence that has been presented before them
 " Kanika further told Pinkvilla, "I don't know if my sister divorced Deepak Tijori before marriage
" us vyakti (shivani ke pehle pati) ne bhi shaadi kar lee he to kya uski shaadi kaa bhi koi matlab nahin he? yah sab bakawaas he

 He told Pinkvilla, "he lives there

 They come and go in the house
 vah unhen ghar se kaise nikaal sakati hai, vah unki beti ke pita hai? vahaan unka apana cameraa he or yadi unhen ghar se nikaala gaya to aapako kya lagata he ki unke paas chaabiyaan nahin hongi?"

 unhone kaha, "jaahir he ki koi press main aisi khabaren de rahaa he taaki court ko isse prabhavit kiya ja sake
 Both divorce cases are in the court and settlement has to be made for alimony
 kya yah sambhav he ki 26 saalon tak shaadishuda jindagi bitaane ke baad ek vyakti ko ahsaas ho ki uski shaadi kaa koi matlab nahin he? ham aisi khabaron se chintit nahin hai, court apana faisla un sabooton ke aadhaar par legi jo unke saamne prastut kiye gaye hai

 In another attack on the Narendra Modi government, on Saturday, Rahul Gandhi accused the provisions of the Real Estate Regulatory Authority Bill for sabotaging the interests of builders rather than buyers

 Assuring standing with the flat buyers, Rahul Gandhi said that due to lack of transparency, the buyers of the flat have been left in the balance
 rahul ke mutabik, unhen yah bataaya gaya tha ki unhen ek tay din ko flats mil jaaenge lekin saalon se unhen flats nahin mili
 They were told that the super duper area of the flat would be much higher but what has been given is somewhat different
 rahul gandhi ne kaha ki kisi ko vaada kiya gaya tha ki flats se acha najaara dikhegaa lekin flats milane ke kuch maheenon baad ek nai imaarat khadi ho gai or najaara najaron se ojhal ho gaya
 The Congress leader said that the government was trying to demolish the bill that the Congress-led UPA government had brought to regulate the real estate sector
 rahul gandhi ne kaha, mukhya kami jo kii gai he vah yah ki vahaan puri tarah paardarshita thi
 The carpet area you sign will be the one you get

 colling main 250 minutes kii seemaa paar karne ke baad yugers ko 1 paise prati second kii dar se charge kiya jayega
 It will be up to midnight
 uske baad nayaa din lagate hi phir se yugers 250 minutes colling kaa laabh le sakenge
 Keep in mind that if users are not able to use 250 calling minutes completely, then it will not be forward
 yaad ke taur par bataa den rialans jeeyo pehali company thi, jisane analimited colling kii shuruyaat apane plance main kii thi
 After Jio, the benefit of unlimited calling started being extended by other companies like BSNL, Airtel and Vodafone Idea

 Apart from this, let us tell you that BSNL recently changed its Abhinandan-151 prepaid plan

 That is, now customers get 1 daily in this plan
 5GB data diya ja rahaa he
 The company has not made any change in the validity of this plan
 graahakon ko yahaan pehle kii hi tarah 24 dinon kii validity milegi
 At the time of launch, the company was giving just 1GB of data daily in this plan

 a case of rape of a 14-month-old girl has been reported in Vidisha district of Madhya Pradesh

 The officer said that after this, the 13-year-old son of the accused came to the girl's house, saying that the girl had fallen on her barbed wire and got injuries
 bacchee ke nijee ang par jakhm dekhakar uski maa use aspataal le gai , jahaan doctoron ne bacchee ke saath yon utpeedan kii baat kahi
 He said that a case has been registered against the accused under various sections of Indian Penal Code and Poxo Act
 bataa den ki madhya pradesh main iske pehle mandsaur main ek naaballig bacchee se samuhik dushkarm kaa maamla saamne aayaa tha, jiske baad logon ne jamkar pradarshan kiya tha
 The girl is admitted to MY Hospital in Indore and her condition remains stable

 chhattisgarh main naksaliyon ke khilaaf ek baar phir joint oparation kii taiyaari jor shor se chal rahi he
 In fact, the police have taken direct advantage of the late monsoon
 aamtaur par barish ke mausam main jangalon kii hariyaali or bhitari raaston main nadi naalon ke ufaan main hone se jangal main daakhil hona mushkil hota he
 But this time the Naxalites have broken their back due to the delay in arrival of monsoon
 telugana rajya ke gathan ke baad chhattisgarh se satee andhra pradesh kii sarhad se naksaliyon kii awajahi lagbhag khatm hone ke baad kendriya suraksha balon ne chhattisgarh or maharashtra kii sarhad ko naksalwad se mukt karne ke liye apni puri takat jhonk di he
 After the surrender of several big Naxalite leaders, the police has launched a joint operation in the Naxalite affected areas
 chhattisgarh main barish ke mausam main police naksaliyon ke khilaaf kisi bhi tarah kaa oparation nahin chhedati
 The main reason for this is the difficulty in visibility to them from the greenery of the forests
 yahi nahin kai baar jangal ke bheetar ke khet khalihaanon main hariyaali or kam visibility ke chalate nirdosh gramin bhi maare jate hai
 But this time it is not so
 monsoon kii letlatifi kaa bharpoor phayda police uthaa rahi he
 The monsoon has not knocked over most parts of the state
 khaastaur par bastar main
 Therefore, this time in the rainy season, the police and central security forces are entering the forest and fighting the cross-border battle against the Naxalites
 barish nahin hone se jangalon ke bheetar paryaapt roshni mil rahi he
 Not only this, the river rivulets and water tanks within the forest are dry
 isse police or kendriya suraksha balon ke javaanon kii chautarafa awajahi ho rahi he
 In view of the opportunity, the police of Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh have launched a big campaign against the Naxalites
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki is oparation ke liye modi sarkaar ne khaastaur par manjuuri di he
 Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Raman Singh says this will go on
 iske liye hamen sooyeeboojh se kaam karnaa padegaa
 Therefore, from Mahasamund, Saraipali, we have demanded and are getting additional battalions in these areas
 hamen do atirikt batalian milenge
 We will deploy them in the area of dantewada, Bijapur
 barish main naksaliyon ke khilaaf oparation chhedane kaa ek mahatvapurn kaaran or bhi he
 In fact, after the formation of Telangana state, the movement of most Naxalite leaders in the state is over
 kai bade naksali cmanderon ne chhattisgarh or andhrapradesh main aatmasamarpan kiya he
 Their surrender has weakened the roots of Naxalism
 radha, ram lakshmana, shankar vaasa, sumaru, gopi, bula or budhram jaise kukhyat naksali sarender kar chuke hai
 The roots of Naxalism have been shaken by their surrender
 yahaan tak ki naksali dalam chalaane ke liye aavashyak rakam tak nahin juta paa rahe hai
 Dalam only has to take the weapons stolen from the police
 naksali ladaakon ko naa to tankhwaah mil paa rahi he or naa hi gaanv se pehle kii tarah samarthan hi hasil ho rahaa he
 So they are in the path of surrender
 naksali andolan pehle kabhi itnaa kamjor nahin hua he
 Keeping this in mind, the joint operation has been approved
 special investegative branch ke diaiji dipanshu kabra kaa kahana he ki naksaliyon kaa andolan ab samaapti kii ore he
 Police is addressing the common people in rural areas and solving their problems
 isse logon kaa police par bharosa badha he
 The villagers no longer help the Naxalites as before
 hamen bhi ab unki soochna milane lagi he
 We are hopeful that the Naxalites' grip will be further weakened by the rainy season
 kyonki jis tarah se kendriya suraksha balon ke saath talmail bithakar ham kaarywahi kar rahe hai, usase naksaliyon kaa dabadabaa kam hua he or wo apana ilaaka chhodkar bhaag rahe hai
 In hundreds of villages of Philahal Bastar, police and central security forces personnel are busy winning the hearts of the villagers on the one hand, and on the other hand they are busy fighting two or two hands with the Naxalites inside the forest

 Adorned with many star players, the Bangalore team made a grand start to their campaign by defeating Delhi by eight wickets in their first match of the T20 League
 uskaa muqabla ab us mumbai se he jise apane shuruaati match main kolkata se haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 Yuvraj Singh, who faced criticism for his poor performance in the ICC World T20 final, shut down his critics by scoring an unbeaten 52 not out
 captain viraat kohli ne bhi naabad 49 ran banaae
 Both of these forms are a cause of concern for the opposing teams
 bengalooru ne chotil hone ke kaaran visphotak kris gail kii sevaayen nahin lee lekin isse khaas fark nahin padaa
 Bengaluru's decision to buy Kohli, Gayle and AB de Villiers for Yuvraj for a hefty sum of 14 crores was proved correct yesterday
 yuvaraj pehle match main hi form main laut aae hai jisase bengalooru pehle lig khitaab kii ummid kar saktaa he
 Albie Morkel and Varun Aaron also played well
 aaron ne to teen over main keval nau ran die lekin bengal ke tej gendbaaj ashok dinda prabhavit nahin kar paae
 The star of the day was young leg-spinner Yajuvendra Chahal, who picked up a wicket for 18 runs in four overs and was adjudged man of the match
 bengalooru ko mumbai ke khilaaf bhi apane gendbaajon se isi tarah ke pradarshan kii ummid he
 The Mumbai team did not do well in the first match against KKR and every department of it looks in need of improvement
 jahir khan or lecith maalinga ko chhodkar uske baaki gendbaajon ne lachar pradarshan kiya
 The batsmen also did not show firepower and could not walk in front of Kolkata's target of 164 runs

 VIDEO: bjp's new charge on Kejriwal government VIDEO: kejariwal sarkaar par bijepi kaa nayaa aarope First 9 November in Himachal Pradesh and then 9 and 14 December in Gujarat
 
 
 in tarikhon par hone vaali ‘voton kii jang’ jeetne ke liye bijepi or congress kii ore se koi kasar nahin chodi ja rahi he
 There is a direct face-to-face battle between the two parties in both states, so every wager is being tried to woo voters
 maidan par jahaan congress or bijepi ke diggaj netaa prachaar main din-raat ek kiye hue hai vahiin soshal media par bhi ‘mindgem’ main baaji maarane ke liye donon partiyon ke ‘creative suurama’ apana sab kuch jhonk rahe hai
 Twitter remains an important platform on social media in the 'war war'
 ek duusare ke twitor handles par jamkar sidhe taur par bhi waar or palatwaar ho rahe hai
 At the same time, leaving no stone unturned to pull each other's legs from behind the curtain through proxy war
 soshal media par ‘an-ofishili’ bhi bahut kuch ho rahaa he
 For example, Rahul Gandhi is shown as 'bahubali' in a picture recently seen on social media
 tasviir main rahul ne kandhe par ek kaala koodaadaan uthaaya hua he
 Outside this dustbin, a 'lotus' remains, and inside it are 'shocked troubled' pictures of Narendra Modi, Amit Shah and Arun Jaitley
 ‘sach bharat abhiyaan’ ke saath tasviir main saath hi capshan diya gaya he- ‘ek kadam swatchta kii ore’
 Not only this, in the picture, Rahul is seen moving towards a big dustbin with the shoulder rubbish on which it is written, 'put garbage of 2014 here'
 dilachasp baat ye he ki congress ne apane twitor yaa fasebuk pej se is tasviir ko share nahin kiya he
 But indirectly, this picture is being shared indiscriminately on social media
 yahi nahin ek or video bhi viral ho rahaa he
 In this, a picture of Modi is being shown to the people, in which he is seen wearing black glasses
 videsh main shoot kiye gaye is video main logon se poocha ja rahaa he ki unako kya lagata he ki ye shaks koun hai? jinase poocha ja rahaa he wo log pradhanmantri modi se anjaan hai or anumaan laga rahe hai ki yah koun shaks ho saktaa he? proxi war ke jariye is video ko samarthakon ke jariye saajha kiya ja rahaa he
 Such attacks on social media are not just from one side
 congress party or iske upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ko nishaanaa banane waalon kii bhi soshal media par koi kami nahin he
 a similar video is being shared about the Gujarat elections under proxy war
 is video main rahul gandhi ko hi ‘gabbar singh’ ke taur par dikhaa diya gaya he
 This video came after Rahul Gandhi called GST as 'gabbar Singh Tax'
 is video main dikhaaya gaya he ki gabbar kii tarah rahul teen saathiyon (hardik patel, alpesh thakor or jignesh mewaani) ko hadakaa rahe hai
 Also saying that they were two (the video shows Vijay Rupani and Nitin Patel's photo) and you three, still back
 iske baad video main narendra modi ko jor kaa tahaakaa lagaate dekha ja saktaa he
 The second thing is that it is being cautious that the formal handles or pages of both parties or their leaders on social media are directly avoided in such tension
 aadhikarik taur par congress kaa kahana he ki soshal media par bijepi ke khilaaf ladaai janata lard rahi he
 According to Congress spokesperson Ajay Kumar, "social media is now a reality, the general public of the country is now Twitter or Facebook, now more active than before
" unka man bhar gaya he modi sarkaar or modi ji ke jhuthe aashwaasan sun sun kar
 It has been 3 years and the Prime Minister is still marking the Congress
 3 saal main khud kya kiya ye to bataaen
 This proxy war public is fighting
 ’ajay kumaar ye bhi kehete hai ki chunaav kii tarikhon ke elaan ke saath hi chunaav shuru ho jaataa he
 Ideas are shared through social media
 sandesh ko sahi tareeke se badhaane ke liye istemaal kiye jane vaala koi bhi madhyam ahm hota he
 Ajay Kumar also said that BJP should not spread lies or half-truths through social media, it does not give the right message about the image of a national party
 bijepi ke netaaon ne soshal media par an-ofishili jo ho rahaa he, us par to kuch nahin kaha
 But it should not be forgotten that the videos and clips that are being shown on social media on their official platforms are getting tremendous response from the people
 bijepi ke digital media head amit malviya kehete hai
 'you cannot guess what kind of response we are getting on social media
 ye isliye he kyonki gujarat main party varshon se seva karti aa rahi he
 We have made videos in both Gujarati and Hindi
 ham ekresata ko tod rahe hai or gaiyr paaramparik clips bana rahe hai
 BJP spokesperson GVL Narasimha said that over the years different media platforms or whatsapp have helped in spreading political messages
 aise main swaabhaavik he ki raajnneetik dal sabhi online media platforms kaa istemaal karen or soshal spes par nae prayog karen

 We are bound by the order of the Supreme Court

 Earlier on Wednesday, in a statement issued by the CPI (M) Politburo, "the Prime Minister allegedly said in a public meeting in Kollam in Kerala that the LDF government's stand on the Sabarimala case was" shameful "
 yah bayaan behad nindaneey he
 This is a shock to the government which is implementing the decision of the Supreme Court
 '' paulitte beuro ne modi par aresas prachaarak kii bhashaa bolne kaa aarope lagaate huye kaha, ‘‘pradhanmantri modi yah bhul gayi ki unhone bharat ke samvidhan kii shapath lee he
 His statement is a direct attack on the Constitution and the Supreme Court

 The government has banned the rest of GM crops except one species of GM cotton
 lekin 19 july ko sansad main ek sawaal kaa jawaab dete hue sarkaar ne kaha ki is baat kaa koi vaigyanik sakshya nahin he ki ye fasalein maanav upbhog ke liye thik nahin hai
 Although this does not fit the issue of complete ban on GM crops, people concerned about the environment and some farmers 'groups also say that the government is ignoring studies on the issue that harm GM crops' yield

 In contrast to this, a question arises that GM crops can prove to be favorable in the changing environment and climate change and it can also feed the growing population

 It is the only GM crop that has got legal approval to grow in India

 Singh, who came to campaign in favor of Bharatendu Yadav, a Congress candidate from Narpatganj assembly constituency in Araria district of the state, in view of the impending elections to Bihar Legislative Assembly, said that the Bihar government did not properly discharge its responsibility in implementing the central schemes
 singh ne kaha ki centre main samprag kii sarkaar banane par hamane lagaataar yah koshish he ki bihar main teji se pragati ho, bijli, sadak, sinchai jaise kshetron ke vikaas ke liye bihar ko ek vishesh package ke tahat varsh 2004 se lekar abtak kul 6 hajaar karod rupee die ja chuke hai

 Singh said that even where the funds given by the Center reached the public, the state government acted to mislead the public
 centre kii yojanaon ko istarah se pesh kiya jaise vah pradesh sarkaar kii banaayi gayi yojanaayen hai
 Singh said that in the last six years, the Congress UPA government under Soniaji has done a lot of work for the benefit of the poor and the weaker sections of the society

 Corruption needs to be eradicated and it should be done so

 singh ne kaha ki istarah kii kai anya yojanaon kii shuruuaat centre dwaara kii gayi hai or unhen pataa he ki in sabhi yojanaon kaa laabh logon tak nahin pahunch paa rahaa he kyonki inako lagu karne main rajya sarkarein khaas dilchaspee nahin dikhaa rahi hai
 Addressing the people of Narpatganj assembly constituency, he said that this is the reason why his area has not been developed
 unhone logon se in bigade hue halaat ko badalane ke liye congress ko vot dene or sonia gandhi ji ke haath majboot karne ke liye kaha

 is bich injamaam mere paas apane bete ke lekar aae

 a tribal girl was converted and her marriage to a Muslim youth
 dilachasp baat to yah he ki navadanpati ko badhai dene kshetreey saansad faggan singh kulaste sahit bijepi ke tamaam netaa pahunch gaye
 When this matter caught fire, then investigation is being done
 jaankaree ke mutabik, mandla ke ramnagar main 24 april ko panchayat raaj diwas sammelan kaa aayojan kiya gaya tha
 a three-day etc
 festival was also held on this occasion
 is samaaroh ke dauraan 26 april ko mukhyamantri kanyadan yojana ke tahat shivaram vanavaasi kii beti saraswati (22) kaa dharm parivartan karakar uskaa nikaah saddaam hossain se kara diya gaya
 The serious thing is that Saraswati's marriage has been done in the absence of her parents
 prashasnic amale ne kagaji khanaapurti kar adivasee yuvati kaa nikaah kara diya or mahatvapurn baat yah ki is navadanpati ko badhai or aashirwad dene waalon main purv kendriya mantri or bijepi saansad faggan singh kulaste bhi apane saikadon samarthakon ke saath maujuud the
 On this incident, the organization minister of Vishwa Hindu Parishad, Awadhesh Singh said that by plotting in tribal areas, non-tribals are married to tribal girls, so that they can buy land etc
 in the name of tribal and take advantage of government schemes
 iske baad un yuvatiyon kii haisiyat rakhel se zyada kuch nahin hoti he
 He further said that if Saraswati's parents had opposed the marriage to a Muslim, the administration rejected the marriage application
 saraswati kii maansik sthiti acchhee nahin hone kaa hawala diya tha, lekin baad main mukhyamantri kanyadan yojana ke tahat nikaah kaise ho gaya, yah sawaal he
 If the marriage was to happen then the marriage should have been in the plan
 itnaa hi nahin, adivasee yuvati ke nikaah se pehle dharm parivartan bhi karaayaa gaya hoga
 He has complained about the matter to District Magistrate of Mandla Sufia Farukhi
 unhone jaanch kaa bharosa dilaayaa he
 Attempted to contact the Collector several times, but he did not pick up the phone
 aisa lag rahaa he jila prashasan maamle ko thupaane kii koshish kar rahaa he
 The Hinduist organization is deeply displeased with the functioning of the district administration
 anusuchit janajati ayog kii adhyaksh anusuia uike ne kaha ki yah bada gambhir maamla he
 The Commission has sought all documents from the District Magistrate
 iske saath hi pataa lagaaya ja rahaa he ki ek baar jab yah vivaah nirast ho gaya tha, to mukhyamantri kanyadan yojana main nikaah kaise hua
 It is a matter of conversion
 sidhe taur par yah anusuchit janajati varg ke bhole-bhaale logon ke saath dhokhaa he
 He further said that apart from Mandla, people of tribal class have also got married in Dindori, Balaghat, all of them will be investigated
 ayog apni ore se saare dastavejon kii padtaal karegaa
 Action will be recommended against the culprits
 var-vadhoo ko aashirwad dene anusuia uike or saansad sampatiyaa uike bhi pahunchi thim, lekin unhen is baat kaa ahsaas hi nahin hua ki kya gadabadi hui he
 However, BJP and Hinduist organizations are opposing this incident, while the district administration is busy covering it
 is sambandh main sambandhit thane main abhi koishikayatbhi darj nahin karai gai he
 Three rounds of voting are yet to be held in the Lok Sabha elections
 maton kii ginati 16 may ko hogi
 Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh are claiming to be the UPA government again
 lekin congress ke bheetar se hi awaazen uthanaa shuru ho gai hai ki left front ko saath lekar sarkaar banaai jaani chahie
 With this, the fragrance of cooking khichdi to form the Third Front, Alternative Front or 'secular' Government has started
 aisi koi bhi sarkaar bina congress yaa bijepi ke samarthan ke nahin ban sakati
 As far as the BJP is concerned, its strategy is clear - if it wants to form a government, it has to be formed under the leadership of Narendra Modi, or else it should not be formed
 jabaki narendra modi ko rokane ke liye congress kisi bhi had tak jane ke liye taiyaar dikh rahi he
 Otherwise, there is no reason why in the middle of the elections, senior Congress leaders started singing songs of the Third Front or Secular Government
 pehla bayaan maharashtra ke mukhyamantri prithviraj chavaan kaa aayaa
 He said that the Congress will join hands with the Third Front to form the next government
 phir bayaan aayaa videsh mantri salmaan khurshid kaa
 He said that Congress can either take the support of the Third Front or support it to form the government
 shanivaar ko hi sipiem mahasachiv prakaash karaat ne milti-julati baat kahi
 He even gave the hint that his party could also join such a government
 jis tisare morche kii baat baar-baar kahi ja rahi he usamen mulaayam singh yadav, nitish kumaar, em karunanidhi, left front, jaganmohan reddy, kasee chandrashekhar raav, sharad pavaar jaison ke naam liye jate hai
 Jayalalithaa, Mamta Banerjee, Naveen Patnaik's regional front or alternative front also seems to be intermittent
 jabaki mayawati ke bare kuch bhi nishchit taur par nahin kaha ja saktaa
 Obviously, until the results of the Lok Sabha elections come, all these things are just hypothetical
 lekin abhi tak ke janamat surveykshan agar sach hote hai, to aise main tisare morche kii yaa tisare morche kii madad se congress kii sarkaar banane kii sambhaavna bahut kam dikhaai detii he
 The possibility of a difference of about a hundred seats in the seats of NDA and UPA is being expressed and NDA is shown to be approaching the magical figure of 272
 aise main upie ke liye tisare morche kii partiyon ko saath lekar bhi sarkaar banane kii baat dur kii kaudi lagati he
 The big reason for this is that there is little chance of forming a government in which Mamata Banerjee and Left Front or jayalalithaa-karunanidhi are together
 isi tarah lalu-nitish yaa mulaayam-mayawati kaa saath aana raajnneetik rup se asambhav hi lagata he
 It is of course that both Mulayam and Mayawati are supporting UPA-2 from outside
 lekin uski vajah yah he ki donon hi ek-duusare ko sarkaar se baahar rakhana chaahate hai
 The belief that a government that includes one of them will support the other is beyond reality
 mahatvapurn baat yah he ki tisare yaa vaikalpik morche kii sambhavit partiyon main sirf jayalalita, mamata banerjee or naveen patnayak ke hi achche pradarshan kii sambhaavna vyakt kii ja rahi he
