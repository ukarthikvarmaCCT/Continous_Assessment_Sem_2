 - Input IANS dilli main trephic jam kii samasya koi aaj kii dein nahin he balki dilli ke desh kii nai rajdhani banane ke turant baad hi yah samasya paidaa ho gayi thi
 The then Intelligence Bureau director d Petri was so annoyed that he wrote to the Chief Commissioner of Delhi even in an angry letter
 desh kii nai rajdhani main sadakon ko chaudaa or shandaar banaaya gaya tha or 1930 ke dashak ke dauraan sadakon par gini chuni kaaren, taange, baiylgaadiyaan, ghoda gaadiyaan, palki or footpath par chalane vaale hi najar aate the, lekin us jamaane main bhi dilli main yatayaat prabandhan ek badi samasya tha
 At that time, the Director of the Intelligence Bureau, or Intelligence Bureau, used to be D
 Petri
 yah 1925 kii baat he
 One day he got so badly stuck in the jam that in anger he even wrote an angry letter to Delhi Chief Commissioner ER Abbott
 petri ne patr main likhaa, ‘‘rajdhani main yatayaat prabandhan bahut kharaab haalat main he or ise sanbhaalane ke liye ek puure vibhaag kii jarurat he
 "petri had also mentioned that similar traffic remains in Bombay but the situation is better there
" rashtriya abhilekhaagaar main 1920 ke dashak se aise sainkadon dastavej dekhe ja sakate hai jinamein dilli main yatayaat kii samasya kaa vibhinn angrej adhikariyon ne zikr kiya he
 Like today, on the occasion of the annual meeting of the Chamber of Princes held in New Delhi, the traffic problem became more acute

 People have liked to say Akhilesh Yadav's political understanding or to keep his family with him easily at every opportunity
 logon main unke parivaar ko lekar kaaphi sammaan he
 This is the reason why Akhilesh Yadav's simplicity and attachment to family is overshadowed by the party's poor image
 log maanate hai ki jab-jab akhilesh yadav raajnneeti main akele pade unki patni dimple yadav unke peeche saahas banakar khadi raheen
 In the last one year, people liked seeing Dimple with Akhilesh Yadav on every difficult occasion
 party main hue haal ke itane bade ghatnakram ke dauraan dimple yadav har pal unke saath dikhaai deen
 When Akhilesh Yadav took out the Samajwadi Party Rath Yatra in preparation for the election, no elder leader of his family was seen in this chariot
 agar dekha gaya to dimple yadav ko
 Perhaps Akhilesh Yadav understood very well that half the population cannot be ignored in such a journey
 yahi vajah he ki rathyatra ke dauraan us bas main akhilesh yadav ne dimple ke liye jagah banaai thi
 In the video released for the party's promotion, Akhilesh Yadav shared a few moments with Dimple (picture above)
 soobe ke daure par akhilesh yadav apni patni dimple yadav ke saath nikle to puure soobe main yah sandesh gaya hi hoga ki party kaa yah netaa party kii chhavi badalane or sudhaarney ke liye ham kaam kar rahaa he
 Not only did this work, but also landed it on the ground
 party ke mahatvapurn kaaryakramon main akhilesh yadav ke saath dimple yadav kii maujuudagi ne samaajawaadee party ko kai logon ko gharon main or dilon main pahunchane ke kaam bhi kiya he
 Dimple Yadav's activism with Akhilesh Yadav in the party has strengthened Dimple's hold among party workers
 party kaaryakarta akhilesh 'bhaiya' or dimple 'bhabhi' ke naare lagaate ab sunai dete hai
 Before this, hardly any party has heard slogans according to Indian society
 dimple kii saadagi or saumyata ne bhi logon main unki sweekaaryata ko badhaane kaa kaam kiya he
 Recently, even though Mulayam Singh Yadav has not reached the program of the party's manifesto, but Dimple was seen standing with Akhilesh on the stage
 party main andruni ladaai jeetne ke baad akhilesh yadav ne parivaar ke kuch khaas logon ke tikat ko chhodkar baaki un logon ke tikaton ko kaat diya jinaki vajah se party par bahubaliyon ko sangrakshan dene ke aarope lagate rahe
 It is also a criticism and praise that the work done by Akhilesh Yadav government in the last six months to improve law and order was not done in the last four years
 rajya kii raajnneeti main yah itihaas sa hi he ki koi party satta main hone ke baad sattavirohi lahar ke hone kii baat ko kahin se bhi nahin sweekaarti or vipaksh bhi is baat ko bhunaane kii purajor koshish nahin kar rahaa he
 Reason, Akhilesh 'bhaiya' and Dimple 'bhabhi'
 tippaniyan This time the party is contesting on the agenda of development and this is what BJP has been doing for the last two decades
 kaha jaataa he ki apane pati kaa haath bataane ke liye ve mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav kaa twitor va fasebuk acount swayan dekhati hai
 Dimple Yadav is the wife of Samajwadi Party President, Leader of the Legislature Party and Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh Akhilesh Yadav, but he also has his own identity
 vah kannauj se nirvirodh saansad hai
 She lost the first election in the political arena but did not lose heart
 antat: unke pati akhilesh yadav ne apane dwaara jiti gai kannauj loksabhaa seat unke liye khaali kar di
 Dimple filed his nomination papers for this seat
 mukaable main congress, bhaajapa or bahujan samaaj party ne unke khilaaf apana pratyaashee hi nahin utaara jabaki do anya, dasharath singh shankwaar (sanyukt samaajawaadee dal) or sanju katiyaar (swatantra ummidavaar) ne apana namakan waapas le liya
 As a result, he won the 2012 Lok Sabha by-election unopposed and established a record in Uttar Pradesh
 dimple se purv purushottam das tandon ne uttar pradesh kii elahabaad pashchimi loksabhaa seat san 1952 main ek purush pratyaashee main rup main nirvirodh jiti thi
 The presence of Dimple Yadav along with Akhilesh Yadav in important party functions has also made the Samajwadi Party the task of taking many people to their homes and hearts
 party main akhilesh yadav ke saath dimple yadav kii sakriyata ne party kaaryakartaaon main dimple kii pakad ko majboot kiya he
 Party workers Akhilesh 'bhaiya' and Dimple 'bhabhi' slogans are now heard
 isse pehle shaayad hi kisi party main bhartiya samaaj ke hisaab se naare sunai die hon
 Dimple's simplicity and mildness have also increased her acceptance among the people
 haal hi main party kaa ghoshnaa-patr jari karne ke kaarykram main bhi bhale hi mulaayam singh yadav nahin pahunche hon, lekin manch par akhilesh ke saath dimple khadi dikhaai deen
 After winning the internal battle in the party, Akhilesh Yadav cut the tickets of those except the tickets of some special family members, due to which the party has been accused of patronizing the Bahubalis
 yah aalochana bhi he or tarif bhi ki kanoon vyavastha ko sudhaarney ke liye pichley chah maheene main jo kaam akhilesh yadav sarkaar ne kiya vah kaam vah pichley chaar saal main nahin kar pai thi
 It is the same history in state politics that no party accepts the anti-incumbency wave after being in power from anywhere and the opposition is also not trying to capitalize on this fact
 kaaran, akhilesh 'bhaiya' or dimple 'bhabhi'
 The comments is baar party vikaas ke agenda par chunaav lard rahi he or yahi kaam bijepi pichley do dashakon se kar rahi he
 It is said that she sees the Twitter and Facebook account of Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav on her own to get her husband's hand
 dimple yadav samaajawaadee party ke adhyaksh, vidhaan mandal dal ke netaa va uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav kii dharmapatni to hai hi, lekin unki apni alag pahchaan bhi he
 He is an unopposed MP from Kannauj
 raajnneetik kshetra main pehla chunaav ve haar gayi lekin unhone himmat nahin haari
 Finally, her husband Akhilesh Yadav vacated the Kannauj Lok Sabha seat she won
 dimple ne is seat ke liye apana namakan patr daakhil kar diya
 In the contest, Congress, BJP and Bahujan Samaj Party did not field their candidates against them while two others, Dashrath Singh Shankwar (united Samajwadi Party) and Sanju Katiyar (independent candidates), withdrew their nominations
 jiskaa parinaam yah hua ki 2012 kaa lok sabha up-chunaav unhone nirvirodh jitkar uttar pradesh main ek kirtiman sthpit kiya
 Before Dimple, Purushottam Das Tandon won the Allahabad Western Lok Sabha seat of Uttar Pradesh in 1952 as a male candidate unopposed
 party main andruni ladaai jeetne ke baad akhilesh yadav ne parivaar ke kuch khaas logon ke tikat ko chhodkar baaki un logon ke tikaton ko kaat diya jinaki vajah se party par bahubaliyon ko sangrakshan dene ke aarope lagate rahe

 hindu mahasabha kii ore se vakil harishankar jain ne madhyastha kaa virodh kiya he
 He said that if the parties agree in court, then the general public will not accept this agreement
 2
 On this, Justice SA Bobde has said that you are thinking that some kind of compromise has to be done, someone will lose, someone will win
 madhyasthata main har baar aisa nahin hota he
 He said that it is not just a matter of land but of emotions, that is why we want a solution out of the conversation
 koi us jagah bane yaa bigade nirmaan ko yaa itihaas ko pehle jaisaa nahin kar saktaa he
 Therefore, the situation can be improved only by dialogue
 3
 Justice Bobde said that we cannot fix what Babur did, we will only talk about the situation that exists now
 agar koi cese madhyasthata ko jaataa he, to uske faisle se court kaa koi lenaa dena nahin he
 It is not just a matter of land, but also of emotions

 That is why the court wants to resolve this through mutual negotiations
 4
 Justice Bobde said that no one can build that place and spoil the construction or temple, mosque and history of UNDO
 babar tha yaa nahin, vah raja tha tha yaa nahin ye sab itihaas kii baat he
 Only UNDO can result in a situation of mutual interaction
 5
 Justice Bobde said that we have no control over what happened before
 ham is vivaad main ab kya he us par baat kar rahe hai
 We know the impact of the country's body politics
 ye dil dimag or healing kaa masalaa he
 Justice Bobde told the Hindu Mahasabha- you are saying that the agreement will fail
 aap pre jaj kaise kar sakate hai?6
 The Hindu Mahasabha asked the court to send the case for arbitration
 isse pehle notice jaruri he
 This is why the Hindu Mahasabha is opposing it
 unhone kaha ki kyonki ye hamaari jameen he
 Therefore we are not ready for arbitration
 is par justise ashok bhushan ne kaha he ki is maamle main agar public notice diya gaya to maamla varshon tak chalegaa, ye madhyasthata court kii nigaraanee main hogi
 7
 justise bobade ne kaha ki pakshakaron dwaara gopneeyata kaa ulanghan nahin hona chahie
 The media should not have comments on it
 prakriya kii reporting naa ho
 If it is reported, it should be declared contempt
 8
 Justice DY Chandrachud Singh said that it is not only a dispute between the parties, but a dispute between the two communities
 ham madhyasthata ke madhyam se lakhon logon ko kaise baandhenge? yah itnaa aasaan nahin hoga
 We will treat the parties as representatives
 madhyasthata sahmati ke aadhaar par hogi
 9
 vahiin supreme court ke mukhya nyaayadhish ranjan gogoi ne kaha ki ham maamle main jald faisla sunaanaa chaahate hai
 He has asked the parties in the case to suggest names to the arbitrators

 10
 hindu paksh ne kaha ki maan lijie kii sabhi pakshon main samjhauta ho gaya to bhi samaaj ise kaise sweekaar karegaa? is par justise bobade ne kaha ki agar samjhauta court ko diya jaataa he or court us par sahmati detaa he or aadesh paarit karata he
 Then everyone will have to agree

 har din mere phone par aane vaale saikadon messej se ek public news room ban jaataa he
 i stand among you and you are claiming your news like qualified reporters
 mujhe aap par garv he
 Fell in love with you kal ek bujurg apni car se gaye or hamaare liye tasviir lekar aae
 We did not have a reporter to send him and ask for a picture
 jab media house khatm kar die jaaenge yaa jo paise se labalab hai apane bheetar khabaron ke sangrah kii vyavastha khatm kar denge tab kya hoga
 You viewers have answered this
 aapkaa darja mere fain se kahin zyaada ooncha he
 You are my editor kai baar main jhunjhala jaataa hum
 Many phone calls, sorry for that
 aage bhi jhunjhalaata rahoonga magar aap aage bhi maaf karte rahiega
 Earlier this arrangement was done in the news room of the media house
 logon ke sampark samvaadadaataaon se hote the
 But now the reporters have been removed
 stringer se bhi story nahin lee jaati he
 When all this happened, the news room was buzzing with news
 ab in sabko hataa kar star ankar laayaa gaya he
 i request you aap kisi ankar ko star hone kaa ahsaas na karaaen
 not me either
 ye ankar ab jan virdohi gunde hai
 One day when your inner political and religious frenzy will stop, then i will remember everything
 ye ankar ab har din satta ke ishaare par chalane vaale news room main haazir hote hai
 Punya Prasun Vajpayee recently said that calls are received from the PMO to run and drop the news
 cobra post ke sting main aapane dekha hi kaise paise lekar hindu muslim kiye jate hai
 Compared to this system, you viewers have inadvertently developed a news room which i call a public news room
 bas ise trol or trend kii maansikta se bachaae rakhiegaa taaki khabaron ko jagah mili na ki ek hi khabar bheed ban jaae
 i have thought that from now on i will make a list of your information and put it on Facebook so that the guilt of not being able to do the news can be reduced
 yahaan se bhi lakhon logon ke bich pahunchaa ja saktaa he
 Come and see my routine sometime
 ek newzaroom kii tarah akelaa din raat jagakar kaam karata rahata hum
 No person is powerful
 jo taqatvar ho jaataa he wo kisi kii parvaah nahin karata
 i am not, so small things affect
 aajkal is lokapriyata ko nochane ke liye ek nai jamaat paidaa ho gai he jo meraa kurta phaade rahati he
 Speech here ek din isse bhi mukti paa luungaa
 Saturday does not come Sunday, it is remembered that you have to go to give a speech
 uske liye alag se taiyaari karata hum jiske kaaran paariwarik jivan puraa samaapt ho chukaa he
 Soon you will not hear a final about such speeches
 agar aap mere mitra hai to pleez mujhe na bulaaen
 Do not call even if someone has done you a favor
 main ab apni awaz sunuunga saaf saaf manaa kar duungaa
 a man alone cannot bear such a burden
 gardan main dard he
 The condition of the waist is bad
 chaar ghante se zyada so nahin paata
 You all love me very much, please do a little less, do not get admitted in the hospital while deleting whatsapp messages
 isliye sirf zaruri khabaren bheja karen
 Send very thoughtfully mujhe jivan main bahut badhaaiyaan mili hai, ab rahane dijie
 The mind is full koi puraskaar miltaa he to praan suukh jaataa he ki ab hazaron badhaaiyon kaa jawaab koun degaa, dilit koun karegaa
 Leave me alone akelaa rahanaa acha lagata he
 It feels better to fight alone
 gurmarnig massej bhejne waalon ko shartiyon block karata hum
 Many have been blocked
 jab naukari nahin rahegi tab check bheja kijiega! to haazir he public news room main ai khabaron kii pehali suchi
 Basic Teacher Training Course is a course in Uttar Pradesh
 praathmik vidhyalay main shikshak kii naukari paane ke liye yah course karnaa hota he
 The fee for a semester in private college is Rs 39,000
 rajya sarkaar har semester main 42,000 rupee bhejti he
 But this time only 1800 rupees have come to the students' account
 chaatro kaa kahana he ki agle semester main admician ke liye unke paas paise nahin hai
 The MD college student of Agra has sent his troubles
 unka kahana he ki privet or sarkari college ke chaatro ke saath bhi yahi hua he
 The student said that the name of Basic Teacher Training has been changed to Diploma in Elementary Education from the session 2018
 isamen rajyabar main 2 lakh chaatr honge
 Now when 2 lakh students cannot fight the injustice done to them, then what can i do alone
 inhone kaha he ki main kuch karun to main likhane ke alaava kya kar saktaa hum
 So i am writing here bihar se 1832 computer shikshak chaahate hai ki main unki baat uthaaun
 Take it away ye sabhi paanch saal se outsorcing ke aadhaar par skulon main padhaa rahe the
 At just Rs 8000
 ab inhen hataa diya gaya he
 Have been sitting on a dharna for eight months but no one is listening
 inhen shikshak diwas ke din hi hataa diya gaya
 Many times people take an outsourcing job thinking that one day the government will be permanent
 unhen outsorcing or kantrect kii naukari ko lekar apni raajnneetik samaj behatar kerani hogi
 If not, then they should go in the procession of Ram Navami, which is more discussed today than the hunger of these 1832 computer teachers
 aisa kar ve kam se kam unmaad aadhaarit raajnneeti ke liye praasangik bhi bane rahenge
 The need for jobs and salary will not be felt because the politics of mania is now permanent
 usamen time cat jayega
 There will be no need for salary
 vaise in shikshakon ne ek twitor handle bhi banaaya he jahaan ve mukhyamantri ko tag karte rahete hai
 But no one listens
 pachaas vidhayakon ne inke liye likhaa he magar kuch nahin hua
 This MP MLA is also of no use
 patr likhakar apana boj taal dete hai
 Thousands of Grameen Bank officials and employees have been on strike for three days but have not been successful
 ritairement se pehle ek lakh rupee kii selary hoti he or ritair hone ke agle hi maheene inaki pension 2000 bhi nahin hoti he
 Many elderly bankers are in poor condition
 koi 2000 main kaise ji saktaa he
 Look at the leaders' car and clothes
 ayyashi chal rahi he bhai logon kii
 Look at the tongue, speaking like goons
 aapkaa saansad or vidhayak pension letaa he or aap se kahata he ki pension mat lo
 This miracle happens because you are not politically conscious
 aakhir aisa kyon he ki sarkarein kisi kii nahin sunati to phir kyon in do kaudi ke netaaon ke peeche aap apana jivan laga dete hai
 Students of Katihar Medical College are constantly messaging
 vahaan doctor faiyaaz kii hatya ho gai thi
 The college administration considers itself a suicide
 faiyaaz kii hatya ko lekar chaatr andolan kar rahe hai
 Candles are marching
 bahut dukhad prasang he
 Students have also performed in Gopalganj, Katihar
 doston apni ladaai main mere is lekh ko hi shaamil samajhnaa
 There is no need to meet or message again and again
 kaash sansadhano vaale channel ke log aapaki khabar kar dete tab tak aap apane gharon se har news channel kaa conection katwa den
 Do not spend on one rupee channels
 tippaniyan Anwar was dismissed, Anil survived
 haansi se kisi pathak ne dainik bhaskar kii cliping bheji he
 It has been written in the news that the Government PG College administration sacked Anwar, a member of the Progressive Student Union and warned another member Anil
 acchhee baat he ki sabhi chaatro ne iskaa virodh kiya he or principal savita maan se milakar andolan kii chetavanee di he
 Bhaskar has written that the history department of the college organized a speech competition on 22 March on the occasion of the martyrdom of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru
 kaarykram main progressive students front ke sadasyon ne pustak pradarshnee lagaai
 Jail diaries, documents and other progressive magazines of Bhagat Singh were kept
 chaatro ne kaha ki principal ne craryakram ke bich se hi sab hatwa diya
 Students' iphones were taken away
 iske baad notice lagaaya gaya jisamen anwar kaa naam kaatane or anil ko chetavanee dene kii baat likhi hui he
 Students have protested
 principal ne kaha ki anwar anushaasanheenata karata he
 Does not listen to the professors
 diwaar par poster chipka detaa he
 He was warned several times but did not listen
 hamane bhaskar kii khabar yahaan utaar di

 Your message has created a new model of journalism
 uske liye main aapke prati aabhaar vyakt karnaa chahta hum or pranaam karnaa chahta hum
 School series, bank series, job series, agitation series have all been possible due to you guys
 do teen jununee samvaadadaataaon kaa saath mila he magar iskaa sara shrey aap public ko jaataa he
 No news room in the world could collect so much information in a day or a week
 mahila bankeron ne apni sari vyathaa bataakar mujhe badal diya he
 They are all like my friends now
 aap sabhi kaa bahut shukriya
 Every day hundreds of messages on my phone become a public news room
 main aapke bich khadaa rahata hum or aap qaabil samvaadadaataaon kii tarah apni khabaron kii daavedaari kar rahe hote hai
 I'm proud of you aapse pyaar ho gaya he
 Yesterday an elder went by his car and brought a picture for us
 hamaare paas samvaadadaata nahin tha ki use bhejkar tasviir manga sakuun
 What will happen when media houses are dismantled or those who are full of money end the system of collection of news within themselves
 iskaa jawaab to aap darshakon ne diya he
 Your status is higher than my fan
 aap hi mere sampadak hai
 Sometimes i get annoyed
 bahut saare phone kol uthaate uthaate, uske liye maafee chahta hum
 i will continue to annoy you even further, but you will continue to forgive
 yahi vyavastha pehle media house ke news room main hoti thi
 People had contact with reporters
 magar ab samvaadadaata hataa die gaye hai
 Story is also not taken from stringer
 jab yah sab hota tha to news room khabaron se gulzaar hota tha
 Now all these have been removed and brought to Star Anchor
 aapse ek guzarish he
 Do not make any anchor feel like a star
 mujhe bhi nahin
 These anchors are now anti-people goons
 ek din jab aapke bheetar kaa siyaasi or dharmik unmaad thamega tab meri har baat yaad aegi
 These anchors now appear in the news room at the behest of power every day
 punya prasoon vaajapeyi ne haal hi main kaha he ki khabaron ko chalaane or giraane ke liye piemo se phone aate hai
 In the sting of Cobra Post, you saw how Hindu Muslims are made with money
 is system ke mukaable aap darshakon ne jane anjaane main hi ek news room viksit kar diya he jise main public news room kahata hum
 Just keep it from the mentality of trolls and trends so that the news gets a place and not a single news crowd
 maine sochaa he ki ab se aapaki soochnaaon kii suchi bana kar fasebuk par daal duungaa taaki khabaron ko na kar paane kaa aparadhbodh kuch kam ho sake
 It can also be reached from among millions of people
 kabhi aakar aap meri dincharya dekh len
 Like a newsroom, i work awake day and night alone
 koi banda taqatvar nahin hota he
 The one who becomes powerful does not care about anyone
 main nahin hum isliye choti choti baton kaa asar hota he
 Nowadays, to break this popularity a new group has been born, which keeps tearing my shirt
 yahaan bhaashan vahaan bhaashan karaane vaali jamaat
 i will get rid of it even one day
 shanivaar ravivaar aata nahin ki yaad aa jaataa he ki kahin bhaashan dene janaa he
 i prepare separately for him, due to which the family life is over
 jaldi hi aise bhaashanon ko lekar aap ek antim naa sunenge
 Please do not call me if you are my friend
 koi ahsaan kiya he tab bhi na bulaaen
 i will now hear your voice and will clearly refuse
 akelaa aadmi itnaa boj nahin uthaa saktaa he
 There is a pain in the neck
 qamar kii haalat kharaab he
 Can't sleep more than four hours
 aap sab mujhe bahut pyaar karte hai, thodaa kam kiya kiijie, whatsap ke messej dilit karte-karte kahin aspataal main bhartee na ho jaaun
 So just send the necessary news
 bahut soch samaj kar bhejie
 i have received many congratulations in life, now let it be
 man bhar gaya he
 If someone gets an award, then the soul dries up who will answer thousands of wishes, who will do the delet
 mujhe akelaa chhod dijie
 It feels good to be alone
 akelaa bhid janaa usase bhi acha lagata he
 i block the bets to send goodmarking messages
 bahuton ko block kiya he
 Send a check when the job is no more! So the spot is the first list of news in the public news room
 uttar pradesh main basic teacher training course ek paathyakram he
 To get a teacher's job in primary school, this course has to be done
 privet college main ek semester kii fees he 39,000 rupye
 The state government sends Rs 42,000 every semester
 magar is baar chaatro ke khate main 1800 rupee hi aae hai
 Students say that they have no money for admission in the next semester
 agra ke emdi college ke chaatr ne apni pareshaani bheji he
 He says the same has happened with private and government college students
 chaatr ne bataaya ki basic teacher training kaa naam satr 2018 se badalakar diploma in elimentry ajukeshan kar diya he
 It will have 2 lakh students across the state
 ab jab 2 lakh chaatr apane saath hone vaali ninsaphi se nahin lard sakate to main akelaa kya kar saktaa hum
 They have said that if i do something, what can i do other than writing
 so yahaan likh rahaa hum
 1832 computer teachers from Bihar want me to raise their point
 lijie uthaa detaa hum
 All these were teaching in schools on outsourcing basis for five years
 maatr 8000 rupee par
 Now these have been removed
 aath maheene se dharne par baithe hai magar koi sun nahin rahaa he
 They were removed on Teachers' Day itself
 kai baar log yah sochakar outsorcing vaali naukari tham lete hai ki sarkaar ke yahaan ek din permanent ho jayega
 They have to improve their political understanding of outsourcing and contract jobs
 nahin kar sakate to unhen ramanavami ke juluus main janaa chahie jisaki aajkal in 1832 computer shikshakon kii bhukhmaree se zyaada charchaa he
 By doing so, they will at least remain relevant to the politics of mania
 naukari or selary kii zarurat bhi mahasoos nahin hogi kyonki unmaad kii raajnneeti ab permanent he
 Time will be cut in that
 selary kii zarurat hi nahin padegi
 However, these teachers have also created a Twitter handle where they keep tagging the Chief Minister
 magar koi nahin sunata he
 Fifty mlas have written for them but nothing happened
 ye saansad vidhayak bhi kisi kaam ke nahin he
 They postpone their burden by writing a letter
 hazaron kii sankhya main gramin bank ke adhikari or karmchaaree teen dinon se hadtaal par hai magar inhen safalataa nahin mili he
 There is a salary of one lakh rupees before retirement and their pension is not even 2000 in the very next month after retirement
 bahut se buzurg bankeron kii haalat karaab he
 How can someone live in 2000? aap netaaon kii gaadi or kapade dekhie
 Ayyashi is going on, brother
 jubaan dekhie, gundon kii tarah bol rahe hai
 Your MP and MLA takes pension and asks you not to take pension
 yah chamatkaar isliye hota he kyonki aap raajnneetik rup se sajag nahin he
 After all, why is it that governments do not listen to anyone, then why do you put your life behind these two clams leaders
 katihaar medical kalege ke chaatr lagaataar massej kar rahe hai
 Doctor Fayaz was killed there
 college prashasan khudakushi maanata he
 Students are agitating over Fayaz's murder
 candal march kar rahe hai
 It is a very sad incident
 gopalganj, katihaar main bhi chaatro ne pradarshan kiya he
 Friends, consider this article to be included in my fight
 milane kii zarurat nahin he na baar-baar messej karne kii
 i wish the people of the channel with the resources to make your news till then, you should cut the connection of every news channel from your homes
 ek rupaya channelon par karch na karen
 The comments anwar barkhaast ho gaya, anil batch gaya
 a reader from Hansi has sent a clipping of Dainik Bhaskar
 khabar main likhaa gaya he ki government piji college prashasan ne progressive student union ke sadsy anwar ko barkhaast kar diya or ek anya sadsy anil ko chetavanee di he
 It is good that all the students have opposed this and together with Principal Savita Mann have warned of the movement
 bhaskar ne likhaa he ki college ke itihaas vibhaag ne 22 march ko bhagat singh, sukhdev or raajaguru kii shahadat ke maukey par bhaashan pratiyogita karai thi
 At the event, members of the Progressive Students' Front organized a book exhibition
 bhagat singh kii jail diary, dastauez va anya pragatisheel patrikaayen rakhi gayi
 Students said that the principal removed everything from the middle of the program
 chaatro ke ai card chin liye
 After this, notice was put in which it is written to cut Anwar's name and warn Anil
 chaatro ne virodh kiya he
 The principal said that Anwar is indiscipline
 praadhyaapakon kii baat nahin maanata he
 Stick the poster on the wall
 use kai baar chetavanee di gai magar nahin mana

 i have thought that from now on i will make a list of your information and put it on Facebook so that the guilt of not being able to do the news can be reduced
 yahaan se bhi lakhon logon ke bich pahunchaa ja saktaa he
 Come and see my routine sometime

 No person is powerful
 jo taqatvar ho jaataa he wo kisi kii parvaah nahin karata

 aajkal is lokapriyata ko nochane ke liye ek nai jamaat paidaa ho gai he jo meraa kurta phaade rahati he
 Speech here ek din isse bhi mukti paa luungaa
 Saturday does not come Sunday, it is remembered that you have to go to give a speech
 uske liye alag se taiyaari karata hum jiske kaaran paariwarik jivan puraa samaapt ho chukaa he
 Soon you will not hear a final about such speeches
 agar aap mere mitra hai to pleez mujhe na bulaaen
 Do not call even if someone has done you a favor
 main ab apni awaz sunuunga saaf saaf manaa kar duungaa
 a man alone cannot bear such a burden
 gardan main dard he
 The condition of the waist is bad
 chaar ghante se zyada so nahin paata
 You all love me very much, please do a little less, do not get admitted in the hospital while deleting whatsapp messages
 isliye sirf zaruri khabaren bheja karen
 Send very thoughtfully mujhe jivan main bahut badhaaiyaan mili hai, ab rahane dijie
 The mind is full koi puraskaar miltaa he to praan suukh jaataa he ki ab hazaron badhaaiyon kaa jawaab koun degaa, dilit koun karegaa
 Leave me alone akelaa rahanaa acha lagata he
 It feels better to fight alone

 1832 computer teachers from Bihar want me to raise their point
 lijie uthaa detaa hum
 All these were teaching in schools on outsourcing basis for five years
 maatr 8000 rupee par
 Now these have been removed
 aath maheene se dharne par baithe hai magar koi sun nahin rahaa he
 They were removed on Teachers' Day itself
 kai baar log yah sochakar outsorcing vaali naukari tham lete hai ki sarkaar ke yahaan ek din permanent ho jayega
 They have to improve their political understanding of outsourcing and contract jobs
 nahin kar sakate to unhen ramanavami ke juluus main janaa chahie jisaki aajkal in 1832 computer shikshakon kii bhukhmaree se zyaada charchaa he
 By doing so, they will at least remain relevant to the politics of mania
 naukari or selary kii zarurat bhi mahasoos nahin hogi kyonki unmaad kii raajnneeti ab permanent he
 Time will be cut in that
 selary kii zarurat hi nahin padegi
 However, these teachers have also created a Twitter handle where they keep tagging the Chief Minister
 magar koi nahin sunata he
 Fifty mlas have written for them but nothing happened
 ye saansad vidhayak bhi kisi kaam ke nahin he
 They postpone their burden by writing a letter
 hazaron kii sankhya main gramin bank ke adhikari or karmchaaree teen dinon se hadtaal par hai magar inhen safalataa nahin mili he
 There is a salary of one lakh rupees before retirement and their pension is not even 2000 in the very next month after retirement
 bahut se buzurg bankeron kii haalat karaab he
 How can someone live in 2000? aap netaaon kii gaadi or kapade dekhie

 On the last day of the Myanmar visit, Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrived at the tomb of Mughal Emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar in Rangoon and paid homage to him
 piem modi kaa ye kadam pehali najar main chaunkaane vaala najar aata he
 On the one hand, the BJP and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh openly show their hatred towards the Mughals, while also trying to erase from the history of India
 aise main pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa bahadur shah jafar kii majaar par janaa chaunkaata he
 Many questions arise by seeing the Prime Minister sprinkling perfume of reverence on the tomb of Bahadur Shah Zafar
 kya ye vahi modi he jinaki rajya sarkarein apni paathya pustakon se mughalon kaa gaayab kar detii hai, to sadakon kaa naam badal detii hai
 The Prime Minister will realize that Bahadur Shah Zafar was also a Mughal
 kya vaaki pradhanmantri 1857 ke swatantraaa sangram ke nayak ko shraddhali dene gaye the yaa unki manshaa kuch or sandesh dene kii thi
 However, the curtain will rise from this
 baharhaal sawaal ye he ki kya modi ke jafar kii majaar par jane se mughalon ke prati bijepi netaaon, sarkaron or unke sanghathanon kaa najariya badalegaa
 In the aspect of this new obsession born to the Mughal emperor, it is to be remembered that though Modi may have attended the court of Zafar, the prejudices of the BJP and the RSS have not yet disappeared
 rajasthan sarkaar ne badla haldighati kaa itihasamughalon ke prati bijepi ke purvagrahon kaa andaja is baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki rajasthan kii vasundhara sarkaar ne satta main aate hi sabase pehle 'akbar mahaan ' naam ke chapter ko hataaya diya
 The BJP government said that why Akbar is great? Why Maharana Pratap is not great? After this the government changed the history of Haldighati
 bijepi sarkaar ke nae itihaas ke mutabik haldighati yuddh main maharana pratap jite the or akbar kii sena haar kar bhaag gai thi
 Before changing history, it was taught that neither Maharana Pratap won the battle of Haldighati nor Akbar's army but according to what will be taught now, the battle of Haldighati was not inconclusive
 nae itihaas ke mutabik maharana pratap apni mathrubhumi mewar kii raksha ke liye bahaduree se lade the or unki sena ne akbar kii sena ko ladaai ke maidan se bhaga diya tha
 State School Education Minister Vasudev Devnani justified this and said that till now history was not being taught properly but now it has been corrected
 maharashtra main itihaas kii kitabon se 'mughal' gaayabamaharashtra rajya shiksha board ne itihaas kii kitabon se 'mughalon' ko gaayab kar diya he
 The state education department has removed the history of Muslim rulers from the entire syllabus
 nae itihaas main iskaa kahin par bhi zikr nahin he ki tajmahal, qutub minar or laal kila aakhir kisne banwaaya
 But this book mentions the Bofors scandal and the Emergency in 1975-77 and explains it in detail

 Rajendra Prasad

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Make in India soon took off from the plank because the investment is to be in the states and the single window clearance will come from governments in the states and not from the center
 udyogon kii sabase badi aas yani guds and services tex (jiesti) rajyon ke saath asahmati ke kaaran hi adhar main tanga he
 If the prices of potato and onion are not ready to come down, then the reason is that the states did not take interest in changing the mandi law
 swatchta mishan agar centre sarkaar ke vibhaagon kaa karmkand banakar rah gaya to isliye kyonki sthaneey nikaayon ko adhikaar dena rajyon kii jimmedaari he
 States are the most valuable link in Modi's reform agenda and so far this link is not strongly linked
 alabatta, maharashtra or haryana ke vidhansabha chunaavon ke baad ise jodgaye kaa mauka jarur aa gaya he
 If the assessment of these elections fits properly, then the BJP will be in power or close to the axis of power in the two major industrial states of the west and north
 lambey samay ke baad pehali baar centre main sattarudh party yaa uske sahyogi dal, uttar or pashchim or madhya bharat ke un sabhi pramukh rajyon kii satta sambhaal rahe honge, jo agle ek dashak main growth kaa ingine banane vaale hai
 After this, there is no reason left for Modi to postpone fast reforms
 centre main bijepi kii sarkaar aane ke baad centre-rajya rishton kaa badla hua paridrishy kathor aarthik sudhaaron ke liye sabase acha sanyog he
 The BJP or its allies hold power with the Center in Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Punjab and Seemandhra and the party's prospects in Maharashtra and Haryana are on the rise
 yah aisa avasar he, jiske liye upie sarkaar das saal ke kaarykaal main tarasati rahi
 Many important experiments of reforms did not come out of this because the political relations of the Center with large and resource-rich states were not warm
 maharashtra, uttar pradesh, tamilnadu or gujarat desh kii chaar sabase badi arthvyavastha kii suchi se hai
 Andhra Pradesh has grown out of the five largest economies after the reorganization
 pashchim bengal yaa karnataka sheersh paanch main jagah lene vaala he
 In this club five of Indian states, Gujarat is with BJP and Maharashtra is on target
 rajasthan, chhattisgarh or madhya pradesh ubharate hue rajya hai, jahaan nivesh or growth ke bade avasar ban rahe hai
 Dun & Bradstreet estimates that 11 states in India (maharashtra, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Rajasthan, Kerala, Bihar, Odisha and United Andhra) will account for 76% of the country's GDP by 2020
 philhal unka hissaa 68 fisadi he
 The dreams of employment, growth and Make in India are to be found in these 11 states, but during the last three months, Modi has not done any work on rejuvenating the relations with the states, so the promotion of his efforts is rooted in the ground of reality
 It does not seem to be catching up and the unsuspecting investors are unable to meet the promises of reforms
 modi ne jab yojana ayog kii vidaai kaa elaan kiya tha to rajya sahamat the kyonki yojana ayog kii samaapti ke saath us skim raaj kaa khaatmaa judaa tha jo vikaas ke nirnay lene main rajyon kii aazaadee kaa galaa ghontataa tha
 While Modi was the chief minister, he himself was a strong opponent of the Centre's bullying about the scheme, so the states hoped that after his arrival the financial relations with the Center would improve and the transfer of rights would increase
 lekin modi kii sarkaar to nae skim raaj kii shuruyaat karti dikh rahi he jo puraane or manamaane dhaanche kii peeth par ladaa ja rahaa he
 This arrangement is more opaque than before
 yojana ayog ke daur main rajyon ke liye ek formula to tha, endie sarkaar kii skiimon main to rajyon kii bhoomika hi tay nahin he
 Tax (GST), land (land acquisition) and electricity (coal mines and power purchase agreements) are the three most basic reforms for which all states have to agree but the Prime Minister has yet to communicate reforms to his party's state governments
 Have not been able to connect to
 yahi vajah he ki mek in india ke baavjood maahaul main koi bada badlaav nahin dikhataa
 Central and state governments are not restless with the closure of Nokia's mobile phone factory in Chennai
 pashchimi uttar pradesh kii chini milon kii vittiya ridh tuutane par dilli or lakhanu phikrmand najar nahin aae
 Investment in the states is stalled due to postponement of mines, the level of coal available with power stations is the lowest in 25 years, but the Center and the states do not seem to be trying together because Modi has no channel of partnership with states in economic decisions in the last three months
 Have not been able to make yahi sthiti pichhali sarkaar main thi isliye rajyon ne nivesh or branding ke alag model bana liye the, gujarat ke mukhyamantri ke taur par modi jiske sutaradhar the
 High growth states also have political compulsion and it has been tried in the last few years
 2012-13 ke dauraan 26 main 22 rajyon kii vikaas dar rashtriya jidipi kii gati se zyada tej thi
 The political map of the Center and the states is completely compatible with reforms, the new government has to make new chemistry of federalism
 pradhanmantri modi rajyon ke liye adhikaron kii maang karte hue dilli aae hai
 However, sitting in Delhi, they will have to decrease the rights of the Center and increase the influence of the states
 gathbandhan todakar siyasat ke shikhar ko chune vaale modi ko gavarnence or growth ke liye gathbandhan banane honge or satta ke vikendrikaran kaa nayaa dizin taiyaar karte hue yah yaad (andrew caranegi kii baat) rakhana hoga ki yadi koi sara kaam khud karnaa or uskaa shrey bhi lenaa chahta he to bade parivartan mushkil ho jate hai

 Fingers have been pointed at the ministers of the BJP government of Maharashtra
 unke sampatti ke khulaase na hone se yah poocha ja rahaa he kii aakhir mantriji jaankaree saarvajanik kyon nahin kar rahen? RTI kanoon ke tahat daayar arji se yah sawaal ubhara he
 RTI activist Anil Galgali had asked in his application whether the ministers of Maharashtra government have made their assets public? The reply received in response to this application states that no minister of the state has yet reported his assets
 is jawaab ke baad galgali ne mukhyamantri karyaalay ko ek khat likhakar guzarish kii he ki, mantri apni sampatti kii soochna ko jald saarvajanik karen
 Talking to NDTV India, Anil Galgali said that, it has been more than 100 days sent to his letter
 lekin, abhitak koi jawaab nahin mila he
 They want to remind that the current central government has written to all the states that the minister should make public the information related to his property
 maharashtra kii sarkaar main bijepi ke 20 or shivasena ke 10 mantri hai
 The government is saying that everyone has recently given details of their assets to the Election Commission as a candidate
 aise main mantri banane par is soochna ko saarvajanik karnaa anivaary nahin he
 State Chief Devendra Fadnavis while talking to NDTV India said that, in 2008, the Supreme Court has stated in an order that no minister can be forced to make his property information public
 yah soochna unhen rajya ke mukhya sachiv ne di he
 The Chief Minister further said that, till August 31, the time is to make the property public
 aise main ham jaanboojh kar soochna nahin de rahen, yah aarope lagaana uchit nahin
 And even though this information will not be mandatory
 tab bhi ham soochna jald saarvajanik karenge
 The matter of making the assets of ministers public has been going on since the time of the old government
 ahm baat he ye ki isse pehle kii congress-ensipi sarkaar ke mantriyon ne bhi apni sampatti online uplabdh nahin karaayi thi
 By the way, an opinion has not been formed in the council of ministers of many states of the country on making their property public

 pichley kuch maheenon main kam-se-kam teen hamalavar harakatein darj kii gai hai, jinamein pakistan ne bhartiya yuddh poton ko uksaane kaa kaam kiya
 a senior defense official admits, "we found that tensions in the sea have been steadily increasing
 '' adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki 16 june kii ghatana khabaron main sirf is vajah se ai kyonki yah donon deshon ke bich ek bade kootnithik tanaav kii vajah ban gai thi
 In fact, contact was also made in the warships of the two countries for the first time
 taaja ghatana main somalian luteron se chhudaae gaye mistra kii milkiyat vaale vyapaarik pot emvi suez ko pienes babar waapas pakistan le ja rahaa tha tabhi ienes godavari vahaan pahunch gaya
 The Pakistani warship moved backwards towards the Indian ship, causing minor damage to the net of the dispersed helicopter
 adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki ulate pakistan ne hi bharat par uske bachaav kaary main baadha daalane or uske yudhpot babar ko ragadkar aage badhane kaa aarope laga diya
 The charge was strongly opposed by both the Ministry of External Affairs and the Indian Navy
 bhartiya nausena ne to pakistan ke saath is vaardaat ke video or photograph bhi saboot ke taur pesh kar die
 It is almost an unwritten rule for both navies that they pursue each other's warships by keeping a fixed distance
 lekin pichley kuch maheenon main pakistani yudhpot kai baar bhartiya yupoton ke ''bahut najadik'' pahunchate rahe hai, baj dfa to ye itane paas se guzarate rahe hai ki donon ke bich kii duuri 80 foot tak rah jaati thi
 After this, the Pakistani crew members make obscene snatches and wave their arms towards the Indian Marines
 udaan kii duniya main jise ''bal-bal bachanaa'' kaha jaataa he, uskaa nausainik sanskaran vah hatkandaa he, jiskaa istemaal soviet sangh ne sheet yuddh ke dauraan nato ke yupoton ke khilaaf kiya tha
 Such manipulations grossly violate the Confidence Restoration Measures (CBM), which were signed and vetted by the governments of both countries in 1992
 ek bhartiya yudhpot ke captain dwaara ek pakistani nausainik tohi vimaan par golibari karne ke baad taiyaar kiye gaye bharosa bahaali ke in upayon main kaha gaya he ki donon deshon ke yudhpot ek duusare se kam-se-kam teen samudri mile dur rahaa karenge
 These measures prohibit "buzzing" or any aircraft from getting too close, and there is also a provision to inform each other of any naval exercise involving more than six warships
 lagata he ki bharosa bahaali ke ye upaay itihaas main dafan ho chuke hai
 In an incident a few years ago, a Pakistani warship's helicopter hovering on the helicopter deck of an Indian warship caused an Indian naval helicopter to land on the deck
 ek anya pakistani nausainik jahaaj vimaanvaahi pot bhadakaane vaale andaaj main ienes viraat ke bilkul paas aa gaya
 There have also been incidents in which the Pakistani crew went naked in front of the Indian crew or began to tighten the snaps

 "they say," No Navy committed to its duty can tolerate such antics
 '' nausainik adhikari kehete hai ki pakistani varisht adhikari aisi harkaton par nakeval ankhen munde rahete hai, balki inhen badhaava bhi dete hai
 Says a naval officer, "if the captain of INS Godavari had done what the Babur captain had done, he would have faced a court martial
 ''ek raksha adhikari kehete hai, ''hamaare saamne ulajhn kii sthiti he
 If we respond (to their antics), there is a danger of increasing tension
 or agar ham nahin dete, to hamaare saamne apane chaalak dal kaa hausala tuutane kaa sankat khadaa ho jaataa he
 "both the government and the Indian Navy have advised to be very cautious in such extremely stressful conditions, because warships operate far beyond their shores and on the other they are heavily armed with missiles and cannons
" raksha adhikari kehete hai ki pakistani budtamiji kii ek vajah he uski nausena kaa badhata aatmavishvaas
 Since 2001, it has had new ships
 china main bana yudhpot pienes julfikar pakistani nausena kaa hasil kiya pehla ''sachmuch nayaa'' yudhpot tha, jabaki pakistani nausena isse pehle america or britain kii nausenaon ke tyaage hue jahaajon se hi kaam chalaati thi
 It has also gained expertise and respect by working with other navies of the world
 2009 ke baad se pakistani nausena chaar baar bahurashtriya sanyukt kaarydal-151 (sitief-151) kii kaman sambhaal chuki he
 This task force of five navies was formed two years ago to take action against pirates in the Gulf of Aden and Somali Valley areas
 iskaa nateeja niklaa bhartiya nausena ke dabadabe ko chunauti dene kii pravriti main
 The Indian Navy is not included in the CTF-151
 donon nausenaon main bharosa bahaali kaa aisa koi upaay nahin he, jisamen ek duusare ke yudhpot saamaanya taur par bandargah par baat karte hon
 While the two armies hold flag meetings to ease tensions, there is no contact between the Indian and Pakistani Navy
 nausena ke purv upapramukh vaais admiral suresh bangad kehete hai, ''samudr main aisi ghatnaon se bachane ke liye hamen sirf bharosa bahaali ke upayon se zyada kuch karne kii jarurat he

 At the same time, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and Home Minister Rajnath Singh said that it was only the fear of Modi's popularity and the bjp's successes that brought together many different forces against the Prime Minister
 jetali ne kaha ki vipaksh kii kisi tarah kii golbandi avyavhaarik or kam samay tak chalane vaala gathjod hoga
 He also asked, "will it be Modi versus chaos? Jaitley said in a Facebook post that this is going to benefit the BJP in the general elections (due to the united opposition) because an aspirational society will not commit "mass suicide" by voting for a short-term political alliance
 vitt mantri ke vichaaron se sahmati jataate hue grih mantri rajnath singh ne kaha ki yah bhaajapa kii safaltaaon kaa dar he jisane vipakshi partiyon ko ek saath laa diya he
 Senior BJP leader Singh told reporters in Greater Noida, "they (the grand alliance) are afraid that the BJP will form the government again
" ''bhaajapa se naaraaz chal rahe uske sahyogi dal shivasena ne kaha ki haal hi main pradhanmantri narendra modi ne (gujarat main el and tii ke hathiyaar nirmaan centre ke muyne ke dauraan) ek tanks par chadhakar bhaashan diya tha
 Surprisingly, the party asked, "then why are they shivering as the 22 opposition parties are united
" '' pradhanmantri modi ne vipakshi dalon ke mahagathbandhan ko ravivaar ko khaarij karte hue aarope lagaaya tha ki yah ‘bhrashtachar, nakaaratmakataa or asthirataa kaa gathbandhan he tathaa ise un logon ne banaaya he jo bhrashtachar ke khilaaf ladaai se bhaybheet hai
 Reacting to Jaitley's remarks, the Trinamool Congress said that the Kolkata rally convened by Chief Minister (west Bengal) Mamata Banerjee last Saturday shook the foundation of the bjp-led government at the Center
 trinmul congress mahasachiv parth chatarji ne kolkata main kaha, ‘‘pichley do dinon (shanivaar) se chaahe vah pradhanmantri hon yaa anya kendriya mantri, har koi is raily ke bare main baaten kar rahaa he
 Although Mamata Banerjee is not in the central government, she still feels that she is in it
 yahi kaaran he ki biimaar rahane ke baavjood bhi jetali ji is tarah kii tippanee kar rahe hai
 "he said," BJP has realized that only its counting days are left
 
 
 aisa lagata he ki raily ne modi sarkaar kii buniyaad hilaa kar rakh di he
 In an editorial in his mouthpiece 'saamana', Shiv Sena, referring to the solidarity of the opposition at a rally in Kolkata organized by Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee on Saturday, said, "modi should not be under the illusion that his government is immortal"
 ' shivasena ne kaha he ki modi-shah kii jodi ko trinmul congress pramukh sidhi chunauti de rahi hai
 "most of the leaders who attended the rally, including Mamta, have at one time been bjp's allies in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led government and there is no need to make fun of them," the editorial said
 modi kii sarkaar desh kii dushman nahin he, lekin unhen is bhram main nahin rahanaa chahie ki unki sarkaar amar he
 However, the Shiv Sena, an ally of the BJP at the Center and in Maharashtra, defended its right to criticize the party in power (BJP)
 mamata ne shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare ko raily main aane kaa nyauta diya tha lekin party ne kaha ki hamaari ranbheri ham apane hi maidan se phunkate rahete hai or vah hamane sabase pehle foonki he
 The Shiv Sena said, "all the leaders present on Mamta Banerjee's platform were secularists
" shivasena chhadam dharmanirpeksh nahin he
 Our ideology is 'hindutva' and our stand on the issue of Ram Mandir and Uniform Civil Code is firm
 kolkata raily main shivasena kaa ruukh hajam nahin hota
 At the same time, senior Congress leader Ahmed Patel has said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's recent remarks about the grand alliance of the opposition and his gesture have proved that he is scared of his (opposition's) solidarity
 patel ne ahmedabad main samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ‘‘jaisaa ki aap logon ne gaur kiya he, pradhanmantri ab apane bhaashanon main mahagathbandhan ke bare main baaten kar rahe hai
 This shows that there is some kind of fear in his mind
 yahaan tak ki unke haav - bhav se sabit hota he ki vah ab vipakshi ekajutata se bhaybheet hai

 When Madani was asked in the 'aaj Tak' weekly program 'sidhi Baat' that there has been a change in the attitude of Muslims about Modi, he said, 'modi has got the votes of a section of Muslims in the Gujarat elections
 halaat badale hai, jamaana badla he, baharhaal kuch to he ki unhen vot mila he

 samast vishwa main vikhyath shrimadbhagavad gita hi aisa granth he jisaki jayanti manaai jaati he
 Lord Krishna gave the divine message of the sacred Gita to Arjuna in Kurukshetra
 kintu vastav main vah to madhyam maatr tha
 Shri Krishna wanted to warn the entire human race through him

 The Gita spells out the establishment of a fear-free society
 yahi mantra vishwa main shanti kaayam karne main sarvatha samarth he
 Jyotisar in Kurukshetra in Haryana is the land for which the words 'dharma Kshetra Kurukshetra' were used in the first verse of the Gita
 isse adhik mahatv or kya ho saktaa he
 It is true that Kurukshetra has been the name of the eighty Kos Vishal Maidan, where eighteen Akshohini army had landed for the Mahabharata war
 paanch hajaar varsh se bhi pehle mahabharat kaa yuddh hua tha, jo attharah din chalaa
 The war was later
 donon pakshon kii senaayen aamane-saamne thim
 Sri Krishna was the charioteer of Arjuna's chariot
 arjuna ne unhen apane rath ko donon senaaon ke madhya main khadaa karne ko kaha
 When Arjuna, sitting on the chariot, looked at the armed fighters in front, his life started drying up as soon as he saw his grandfather, guru and other relatives
 us samay shrikrishna se arjuna ne kaha ki use swajanon ko markar rajya kii ichha nahin he
 i do not want to go to war
 shrikrishna samaj gaye ki arjuna mohagrast ho rahaa he
 Arjuna posed many questions to Shri Krishna, after answering which Shri Krishna raised him from despair and he agreed to fight again
 niraashaa ko aashaa main badalane kaa naam hi to ‘gita’ he
 During a long period of thousands of years, Kurukshetra was periodically destroyed and corrupted by external invaders
 gita kaa sandesh kahaan par diya gaya tha, yah ullekh kahin par nahin miltaa, kintu yah to sthapit satya he ki kurukshetra main hi yah sandesh diya gaya
 Many of our pilgrimages are in symbolic condition
 gita-sthal bhi aisi hi koti main aata he
 But on the basis of ecological evidence Jyotisar is the preaching place of Gita
 jyotisar gita main gita mandir he
 He is Akshayavat, it is believed that below this, Krishna gave Arjuna the knowledge of the Gita
 gita kaa yah tirth ab acha aakarshak ban gaya he
 The lake is filled with clean water

 The entire Jyotisar is illuminated with electric light

 a national seminar is organized during this ceremony in which scholars from universities and colleges of the country and abroad give their views

 Groups of folk artists from all over the country create a pleasant atmosphere by playing traditional instruments
 is dauraan yahaan aakar vibhinn rajyon se aae kalakaaron ke kala or hunar ke behtareen namoonon ko bhi dekha ja saktaa he
 At the time of Gita Jayanti celebrations, a national festival, a lamp is offered in the holy waters of Brahmasarovar between Shlokocharna and Shakh Sound during the evening
 is dauraan sarovar deepon or unke pratibimb kii roshni main nahaaya hua sa prathit hota he

 viraat kohli kii captaini vaali team india aaj tiruvanantpuram ke green field international stadium main newjiland ke khilaaf tisare or nirnaayak tii-20 mukaable main jeet ke saath siries apane naam karne ke iraade se utregi
 Team India, led by Virat Kohli, is in very good form but New Zealand gave it a tough competition in the first ODI and then the T20 series
 siries 1-1 se baraabar chal rahi he or ashanka jataai ja rahi he ki isse pehle hui bharat-australia tii-20 siries kii tarah hi is siries kaa nirnaayak match bhi barish kii bhent chadh saktaa he kyonki mausam vibhaag ne barish kii bhavishyavaanee kii he
 After 29 years, the international match is being held in Mathew Thiruvananthapuram after almost 29 years
 isse pehle 1988 main vivian richards vaali westeindies ne yahaan 25 janvari ko uniwarsity stadium main bharat ke khilaaf match khelaa tha
 In such a situation, a large number of spectators can reach the stadium for this T20 match played on Tuesday
 kis number par khelenge dhoni ?tisare tii-20 match main mahendra singh dhoni ke ballebaaji kram par sabhi kii nazren tiki hongi
 The demand to convert Dhoni to the shortest format of cricket has once again intensified
 purv diggaj cricketer vivies lakshmana ne kaha he ki dhoni vanade team kaa hissaa ho sakate hai, lekin samay aa gaya he ki sabase chote praaroop main kisi or ko nikharaa jaae
 In the second T20 match, Dhoni had scored 49 runs in 37 balls at a strike rate of 132 which is not a bad performance but his failure to rotate his strike in the last one year is a matter of concern
 dhoni ne paanch gend main boundry se 26 ran jutaaye jisamen teen chakke or do chauke shaamil rahe lekin baaki 32 gend main vah 23 ran hi bana sake
 Now it will be interesting to see what order Captain Dhoni and head coach Ravi Shastri feed Dhoni in the next match
 kuch logon kaa suzav he ki bharat ke jald wicket ganvaane par dhoni chauthe number par behatar hai kyonki isse unhen jamane kaa samay miltaa he
 Team indiateam India had defeated New Zealand by 53 runs in the first T20 but the team suffered a 40-run defeat in the second match, where Colin Munro smashed a century while blasting the bowling attack of the hosts
 ballebaaji main kohli ne 42 gend main 65 ran banaae lekin baaki ballebaajon ne niraash kiya
 Fielders also failed to perform as expected
 siries par apana kabja jamaane ke liye bharat ko behatar ballebaaji or gendbaaji main acha pradarshan karnaa hoga
 India won in the first T20 match played at the Ferozeshah Kotla ground in Delhi, but New Zealand made a good comeback in the second match played at Rajkot to level the series 1-1
 middle order main shreyas ayyar, mahendra singh dhoni or hardik pandya ko acha pradarshan karnaa hoga
 New batsman Shreyas Iyer played some good shots during the innings of 23 runs but then returned to the pavilion after playing a bad shot
 hardik pandya pichley kuch maichon main naakaam rahe hai, lekin captain ne unka bachaav kiya he or vah kal ke match main acha pradarshan karnaa chahenge
 In the last match, the Indian team bowlers were also seen struggling on the pitch
 jasprit bumraah ke alaava, bhartiya team ke kisi bhi gendbaaj kii gendbaaji pich par kamaal nahin kar pai
 The spin bowlers of the Indian team also failed to win the team
 haalanki, is baar tiruvanantpuram stadium kii pich or paristhitiyaan bhartiya khilaadiyon ke liye sakaaratmak parinaam laa sakati hai
 During this match, if for some reason the duckworth-louis rule has to be used, then captain Virat Kohli will have to plan and prepare for it
 newjilandnujiland team kii baat kii jaae, to uskaa pradarshan behtareen rahaa he lekin niyamit nahin
 In the first match of the series, the guest team's performance was poor in every field, but in the second match, New Zealand made a great comeback and showed their ability
 newjiland ke ballebaajon ne bhartiya gendbaajon kaa achche se saamana kiya he jabaki unke spinners or tej gendbaaj trent bolt ne bhartiya ballebaajon ke khilaaf prabhavi pradarshan kiya he
 Bolt broke the back of the Indian top order by sending opening batsmen Shikhar Dhawan and Rohit Sharma in the same over in Rajkot
 aise main agar newjiland ko agar siries par kabja jamaana he, to use pichley match ke pradarshan ko is match main bhi barkaraar rakhana hoga
 Both teams: Team India: Virat Kohli (captain), Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma, Lokesh Rahul, Manish Pandey, Shreyas Iyer, Dinesh Karthik, Mahendra Singh Dhoni (wicketkeeper), Hardik Pandya, Akshar Patel, Yuzvendra Chahal, Kuldeep Yadav, Bhubaneswar Kumar, Jaspreet Bumrah and Mohammad Siraj

 a sensational video footage has surfaced in which the rebels are seen on camera slaughtering the soldiers of Syrian President Bashar al-assad
 video main dikhaaya gaya he ki vidrohi asad ke 7 sainikon ko nagn kar unhen dhakka dekar jameen par baitha rahe hai or phir unki ore bandook tanakar khadey ho jate hai
 Some soldiers also had severe injury marks on their back and shoulders
 sainikon kaa katl karne se thik pehle ring-leader abdul samad issa urf 'chachaa' ek kavita padhata he or phir un par pehali goli daagta he
 He says, 'he has been a partner of corruption for 40 years
 ham uuparavaale kii kasam khate hai, yah hamaari pratigya he ki ham badla lekar rahenge
 'in April 2012, a video of this horrific incident was made, which a few days ago a former rebel fled with him to Syria
 is vidrohi kaa kahana he ki vah apane saathiyon kii krur chaalon se dar gaya tha, isliye vahaan se bhaag gaya
 He has given this footage to the English newspaper New York Times
 issa ko 'chachaa' isliye kaha jaataa he kyonki uske do sahaayak uske bhattije hai
 He wanted a video of kattal-e-aam to be made so that he could collect more funds by showing it to the people giving donations
 footage ke aakhir main sainikon kii laashon ko ek kune main phenk diya jaataa he, jabaki ek bandookdhaari vidrohi camere kii ore dekhte hue muskuraataa he
 The footage may add to the woes of the United States, which is reportedly thinking of a war against the Syrian army using chemical weapons against civilians

 Kerry said, 'I can tell you with a claim that if we turn our face today, the pictures of the people we are seeing in the media will be seen even more, because the extremists will be attracted to it and from Assad They will also be funded, being the only option for combat
 'kerri ne kaha ki agar america aaj koi kadam nahin uthaata he, to america logon ko 'di neuyork times' main prasaarit video ke samaan kai or video bhi dekhne ko milenge
 Kerry also said, "in reality, i believe that American actions against the use of chemical weapons will harm those present in these videos, because in reality it will empower the liberal opposition
" ' videsh mantri ne kaha ki vahaan darjan bhar se adhik 'behad bure' jihadi: hai, jo syria main faili araajaktaa kii ore akshirt hue hai

 aam chunaav 2014 ke liye narendra modi ko bijepi kaa pradhanmantri ummidavaar ghoshit kiye jane se teen din pehle yani 10 sitambar ko party ke alpsankhyak prakoshth ke sadsy 14 naavon main savaar hokar ahmedabad se 60 kilometre dur khubasurat pakshi vihaar nal sarovar ke liye ravaanaa hue
 He chose this environment to formulate a strategy to defend Narendra Modi's biggest weakness in the way - Gujarat 2002
 unhen is baat kii katai chintaa nahin thi ki desh kaa yah sabase lokapriy netaa is kamajori ko kaise jitegaa
 His saga to rise from the ashes of one of the bloodiest communal riots in the country to reach the center of Indian politics is a thrilling story of getting the most out of the worst
 bhartiya raajnneeti ke vimarsh ko badalane vaale modi ab 'hindu’ yaa 'musalmaan’ shabd kaa prayog karne se bachate hai
 He talks about the whole of India
 ve ek dashak pehle apana abhiyaan shuru karne ke samay se hi aisa kar rahe hai
 Still, his well-wishers sitting on the banks of the lake were desperate to decide the arguments to support their warrior
 modi tayshuda manchon se lagaataar bharat kii baat kar rahe hai, lekin abhi tak ve badlaav kaa koi naaraa nahin garh paae hai
 They show the real face of the leaders and make promises
 ve ab bhi desh kii samasyaon ke liye maa-bete (sonia gandhi-rahul gandhi) or kathputli (pradhanmantri manmohan singh) kii trimurti ke sir sara thikra phodte hai
 They promise to adopt Congress-free Gujarat across India
 akele satta kaa lanbaa safar tay kar chuke is shaks kaa tod congress nahin dhund pai he
 However, the Congress is definitely preparing to respond to Modi's new slogans
 modi ke paas vakt he kyonki aam chunaav abhi saat maheene dur he
 But the assembly elections of five states to be held in November this year will give a glimpse of the mood of the country
 modi bhi ise bakhubi samajhate hai or ve nishcint hokar baithne kaa jokhim nahin uthaa sakate
 They need an electoral issue that can create a wave in the public
 unhone pehali jang usee din jeet lee, jab party unhen pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar ghoshit karne ko majaboor dikhi
 With the strength of his work, thinking and ambition, he made it inevitable for the party
 das saal se ve gandhinagar se akele jor laga rahe the
 Though his party has a whole pool of prime ministerial contenders, no leader in BJP received such tremendous support after LK Advani of the Ayodhya movement
 manmohan singh sarkaar kii naakaamiyon kii vajah se niraash logon kii jamaat khari-khari baat karne vaale modi ke saath judati dikh rahi he
 They include people from corporate boardrooms to middle-class homes
 lekin ab pradhanmantri pad ke pratyaashee modi ke liye chunauti 13 sitambar kii nijee jeet ko 2014 main ek aitihaasik kshan main badalane kii he
 This challenge is not only at the ground level, but also at the emotional level
 raajnneeti ke ubad-khabad raaston par chalate hue unhen atal bihari vaajapeyi kii tarah desh ke maansik dharaatal ko bhi jeetna hoga
 The first strategy for this is to vent the enthusiasm of the media and keep making sound bytes
 duusari ranneeti, khud ko nae rup main prastut karne kii he, jiske liye modi ji-tod koshish kar rahe hai
 This prime ministerial candidate has now started speaking in soft language
 modi kaa mishan india ek aisa rajnatik project he jisaki misaalen desh main kabhi-kabhaar hi dekhne ko milti hai
 India is a lawful constituency
 Today, any general rally of Modi is like a focus group, where the brand Modi stands the test
 ve pehali baar vot dene vaale vidhyaarthiyon or yuvaaon, mahilaon, ity visheshgyon, kaarobaariyon or musalamaanon ke chuninda samoohon ke saath choti-choti anaupchaarik mulaakaaten bhi karenge
 They are also going to Madrasas of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Andhra Pradesh to remove anti-muslim and anti-secular tags
 prachaar kii yojana se jude ek bijepi netaa bataate hai, ''modi ji kam-se-kam do-teen madrason main jaakar vahaan naujavaanon se baat karne ke behad icchhuk hai
 He is being propagated as a devil human being who gives vent to the fear of Muslims
 lekin ve musalamaanon ko tushtikaran ke bina vikaas kaa gujarat model bataanaa chaahate hai
 "the campaign slogans have not yet been decided, but the entire electorate will live on 'hope' and 'congress-free India'
" vaise, modi kii pehali praathamikta vidhansabha chunaav vaale paanch rajya—dilli, rajasthan, madhya pradesh, chhattisgarh or mizoram hai
 Voting is likely to be held in five phases, so the party's instruments will be fielded according to strategy

 a senior party leader closely associated with the campaign plan says, "modi has given a clear message that one has to fight hard to get a majority on his own
" 272 se adhik siton kaa sandesh upar se neeche tak har sadsy ke dimag main bharaa ja rahaa he

 Modi's team is preparing promotional material and vision documents to woo Muslims

 At the Jaipur rally on September 17, Muslims were asked to come in caps and burqas

 Therefore, there is a plan to present Modi as such a powerful and dreamy leader of the new scientific era, which will solve every issue
 is jang main soshal media ko mukhya hathiyaar banane ke liye team banaai ja rahi he
 Modi's speeches, his historical economic and development plans in all areas including rural development, his attachment to the family in this era of dynastic politics and other things are being shared on social media

 vah swaabhaavik rup se party main badi jimmedaari ke liye daavedaar banate hai, lekin ho kuch alag rahaa he
 The gun is being put on Chauhan's shoulder
 madhya pradesh ko modi virodh kaa garh banane kii koshish ho rahi he
 Such a message is being given that those who oppose Modi in BJP can find refuge only in Madhya Pradesh
 yani madhya pradesh ko bijepi ke samudr main modi virodh kaa tapu banane kii koshish ho rahi he
 Those who talk of Shivraj Singh Chauhan winning all 29 seats in the Lok Sabha elections are being publicized that the candidates were deliberately selected in such a way that the party cannot win more than 15-16 seats
 jaahir he isse nuksaan shivaraj singh chouhan kaa hi ho rahaa he
 Efforts to put him in front of Modi within the party may further harm him
 haalanki khud chouhan in baton ko samajhate hai
 During the assembly elections, he kept saying repeatedly that he was not in the race for the post of Prime Minister and would work to make Modi the Prime Minister
 in sawaalon se tang aakar unhone disambar ke baad se koi intervyuu hi nahin diya he
 His close friends say that when the message came from Advani that he wanted to fight Bhopal, how could he refuse in such a situation
 unke kareebi poochhate hai ki kya bijepi kaa koi aisa mukhyamantri he, jo adwani ke aagrah ko na maane? Despite this, the message is going on that Chauhan Modi is playing at the behest of his opponents
 vyaktigat taur par chouhan kii mahatvakankshaayen jor nahin maar rahi hai
 He knows that age is with him
 unke saamne chunauti madhya pradesh main agle paanch saal behatar kaam karke dikhaanaa he, taaki aane vaale vakt main vah modi ke baad party kii kaman sanbhaalane ke liye behatar dhang se daavedaari pesh kar saken
 At the Sangh level, it has been recognized that Shivraj has better leadership prospects
 sanghathan main vah swaabhaavik rup se modi ke baad number do ke rup main ubhar sakate hai
 Shivraj will also have to learn some lessons from Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar
 nitish kumaar bhi bijepi main modi kaa virodh karne vaale netaaon ke bahekaave main aa gaye
 He felt that he would be able to stop Modi by taking him along, but the opposite happened
 bijepi main modi virdohi to haashie par gaye hi, bihar main bijepi se alag hone ke baad nitish kumaar musiibat main funsate dikh rahe hai
 There is a possibility in all opinion polls that Nitish Kumar's party will be third in Bihar in Lok Sabha elections, while BJP is first
 agar aisa hota he to loksabhaa chunaav ke baad unki sarkaar par bhi sankat aa saktaa he
 In this era of emergence of regional satraps, these satraps should not bring their ambitions to the aspirations of the people of their states

 Lord Mountbatten had persuaded Nehru that the Queen and President Rajendra Prasad would jointly take the salute
 yah ashobhaneey prastaav tha
 i talked to my colleagues about this

 Radhakrishnan's son S
 gopal se bhi baat kii
 Sensing everyone's mood, Nehru abandoned the idea
 yah pandit nehru kii galati thi ki unhone bharat ke aakhri visarai mountbeton ko desh kaa pehla governor general banane ke liye aamantrit kiya tha
 Jinnah was relatively more realistic
 jab mountbeton ne suzav diya ki pakistan ke bhi governor general bane to jinna ne saaf-saaf manaa kar diya
 Mountbatten nominated a chairman of the Defense Committee, who played a key role in policy-making, a role he should not have been given
 pandit nehru ne vyaktigat taur par us par aapatti nahin uthaai or ye maamle, jin par bhartiya cabinet main charchaa honi chahie thi, nahin uthaae gaye
 In this way, the Defense Committee played the role of the Indian Cabinet in the full knowledge of the Prime Minister
 mountbeton nammaatr ke sanvaidhanik shasnadhyaksh the, iske baavjood unhone pandit nehru ko kashmir kaa mudda sanyukt raashtra sangh main uthaane kii salaah di
 They were also against sending an army to Srinagar before the Maharaja of Kashmir signed the merger letter
 pandit nehru or (sardaar vallabhbhai) patel ne unki salaah na maanate hue vimaan se bhartiya sena ko turant srinagar bhejne kaa faisla kiya
 The Indian Army reached there in time and Srinagar was saved from being taken into the hands of Pakistani attackers
 bharat kii ore se sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad ko bheje jane vaali arji kaa masauda jab taiyaar kar liya gaya to mountbeton ne salaah di ki us masaude ko pakistan ke pradhanmantri liyakat ali khan ko dikhaa diya jaae
 This was such a surprising proposal that even Pandit Nehru refused to obey him
 sardaar patel to is paksh main katai nahin the ki kashmir kaa zikr sanyukt raashtra main kiya jaae, jise ve ‘dis-united neshans’ kehete the
 Pandit Nehru wisely showed the draft to Gandhiji, who made important amendments by cutting 'independent status' and words with pencil

 Pandit Nehru really felt that it was a spontaneous and loving reception of the general public
 jabaki vaastaviktaa yah thi ki yah puri tarah yojit tha
 If the Chinese government does not want to, there is not a single man on the street
 baad ke varshon main jab maine baatcheet ke record ko dekha to yah saaf ho gaya ki vastav main donon ke bich koi vaicharik mail nahin tha or mahatvapurn baat yah thi ki seemaa kaa mudda bhi nahin uthaaya gaya tha

 Former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti has made a big statement while participating in 'agenda Aaj Tak', the grand stage of Hindi world
 unhone kaha ki purv pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi or maujuuda pradhanmantri narendra modi main aasmaan or jameen kaa fark he
 Former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti said that there is a difference of sky and land between Vajpayee and Narendra Modi
 vaajapeyi jab kuch karne kaa nirnay lete thea tab chunaav ke bare main nahin sochate the
 But Modi always thinks of winning the election
 itane bade janadesh ke saath janata ne pradhanmantri narendra modi ko satta saunpi aisa mauka dobaaraa nahin milegaa
 But despite being such a big mandate, he could not do anything
 mahabuuba ne kaha ki purv pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi ne kaha ki vokashmir kaa hal insaaniyatke aadhaar par karnaa chaahate hai
 It was the first time during the government of former Chief Minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed when the state government and the Vajpayee government in Delhi were thinking alike
 unhone kaha ki vaajapeyi ne pakistan ke saath baat kii mujaffarabad kaa rasta khulaa, unhone algaavvaadiyon ke saath baatcheet kii
 He said that after the departure of the Vajpayee government, the UPA government was at the center for ten years, but he could not carry forward Vajpayee's work
 unhone baatcheet ke liye interlocuter niyukt kiya lekin wo kuch nahin kar paae
 Unfortunately, no one thought of Kashmir except Vajpayee in the Congress and BJP governments
 yadi vaajapeyi dobaaraa chun liye jate to shaayad kashmir kii samasya kaa ant ho jaataa
 Mufti said that in Jammu and Kashmir we have to join three corners, the government, Pakistan and separatists
 kyonki kashmir main jo ho rahaa he chaahe jawan maare ja rahe hon yaa aatankwaadi wo hai to hamaare desh or kashmir ke hi bachche

 beete teen dashakon se china ke rahanumaon ne duniya ke saath apane rishton ke liye sthaayee siddhant ke taur par desh ke "shantipurna utthan'' par jor diya he
 For a long time, he had been following the dictates of his former leader Deng Xiaoping - "wait for the time, hide the shine"
 isi ke anuroop unhone china kii shirkat or bhoomika jaruri taur par ek satark desh or america kii aguai vaali vishwa vyavastha ko gande vaale desh ke bajaae anuyaayi ke taur par tay kii thi
 This is not the vision of Xi, however
 vah unke lokapriyatawadi gharelu agenda se kareeb se judaa hua he
 What is at the heart of Xi's intentions to strengthen the legitimacy of the Communist Party of China (CPC) in his country is China's growing stature and status on the international plane — what Xi calls the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation— And with that in the campaign for better life or Xi for the people in the country which is called "chinese dream"
 vishleshak shie kahati hai, "shi jo baat samajhate hai vah yah ki abhi tak party kii vaidhata lenden se judi rahi or anivaary taur par yah kaamkaaj kii vaidhata he'' or oonchi vruddhi dar dena bhi isi par nirbhar rahaa he
 Xi knows that good times cannot last forever
 isiilie, shie kahati hai, "ve khud main or party donon main bhaavnaatmak bharosa zyada chaahate hai
 And China's international reputation is part of his vision
 '' or shaayad khud shi kii pratishtha bhi
 What Beijing's bureaucrat calls Xi's new "proactive" approach is much more than personality and protocol — it has already begun to overthrow the long-established fundamentals of Chinese diplomacy
 inamen antarrashtriya vivaadon main "gaiyr-dakhlandaji'' se lekar videshi sainya addon kaa sanchaalan nahin karne tak ke siddhant shaamil hai
 China has opened its first military base in Djibouti in the Indian Ocean
 aise hi kuch or taiyaar ho rahe hai—pakistan main guadar, seychelles shaayad prashanth main bhi vanuatu
 Whatever the outcome of Wuhan, India is very cautious and careful about China's deepening regional influence
 yah kshetreey asar vah sabase zyada apni us belt or road pahal (biarai) ke jariye failaa rahaa he, jise shi na keval china kii takat or rob-daab ko badhaane kaa aujaar maanate hai, balki apane desh ke ubhaar ko pesh karne main uski gharelu ahmiyat bhi dekhte hai
 Kerry Brown, a former British diplomat and professor and director of the Lau China Institute at King's College, London, says, "the BRI is a celebration of legitimacy for China
 apane desh main vah jajbaati taur par nashila sandesh de rahaa he ki china apane dam par aadhuniktaa ko fatah kar rahaa he
 "it is also giving Xi a platform to compete with the United States — it is offering a different kind of superpower alternative, and pushing his vision of globalization contrary to the separatist idea of" America First "
 praathmik taur par biarai ke jariye shchin ke modely ko videshon main failaane ke liye or zyada sangathit abhiyaan ke liye shi ne hari jhandi de di he
 At the party congress in Beijing in October, Xi said that the Chinese model was "offering a new option" to other countries and nations seeking their development at a rapid pace, and that "the Chinese wisdom and solutions to solve the problems facing mankind Chinese view is showing
 brown kehete hai, "videsh main china america kii tarah mahashakti nahin hona chahta—vah iske jokhim jaanata he
 He wants the status of superpower and legitimacy, but he is focused on what he needs - that is, resources and markets
 ''alabatta badhata hua prabhaav apane saath badhate takaaje lekar bhi aata he
 The accepted Chinese diplomatic doctrine of "non-intrusiveness" is now in the air — it was one of the principles of "panchsheel" that India, China and Myanmar put forward to developing countries in the 1950s
 yah afghanistan se lakar dakshin sudan or myanmar tak pehle hi jaahir ho chukaa he, jahaan beijing siyaasi bichauliye kii bhoomika nibhaane ke liye aage aayaa he or teenon hi maamalon main iske peeche uske gahare aarthik hit jude hai
 Pakistan is emerging as a criterion for Xi where it will be known to what extent Beijing is ready to intervene when big interests are at stake
 yah to saaf he ki siyaasi taur par aisa karne kii or kisi ek kaa paksh lene kii kshamta or bhukh beijing ke paas he, bhale hi vah philhal isaki simaaon or jokhimon ko dhyaan main rakhkar kadam uthaa rahaa he
 China is planning $ 50 billion in projects through the china-pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC)
 sipiisi china or pakistan ke rishton main maatra or gunvattta donon ke lihaaj se baari badlaav he or isamen china ko pakistani arthvyavastha ke takreeban harek pahalu main khud ko shaamil karte hue dekha jayega—jise kuch aalochakon ne aarthik aupniveshikaran kaha he
 China's high stakes and risks mean that Beijing will now be an active player in domestic affairs and will probably go to this extent in its reconciliation with India
 "di china pakistan exis'' kitaab ke lekhak or german marshall fund ke andrew small kehete hai, "sipiisi puure pakistan main or bhi zyada kartadhartaaon ke saath or zyada saudebaaji kii jarurat paidaa kar rahaa he or ye saudebajiyaan zyada se zyada sthaneey hoti ja rahi hai
 "they also say," Beijing is aware that bargaining with the central government alone is insufficient
 '' afghanistan main bhi china kii bhoomika mahaj buniyadi dhaancha banaakar dene vaale se badalakar kahin zyada ahm siyaasi khilaadi kii ho gai he or yahaan tak ki vah china main taliban or afgaan sarkaar ke bich baatcheet kii mejabani kar rahaa he
 As far as India is concerned, it has emerged as the most vocal critic of the BRI
 magar hakeekat yah he ki khaskar buniyadi dhaanche kii pariyojnaon ke liye rakam jutaney kii vyapak jarurat or vikalp ke abhaav ko dekhte hue biarai kaa asia main mote taur swaagat hi kiya gaya he
 But Xi's project is also not safe from shocks and hiccups
 april main indonesia, srilanka, kazakhstan, bangladesh, poland, laos or pakistan main biarai pariyojnaon par kiye gaye japan ke nikkei ke adhyayan se in pariyojnaon main khaasi deree kaa pataa chalaa
 These include a $ 6 billion railway project in Indonesia and delays in projects in Kazakhstan and Bangladesh
 srilanka, maldive or laos ke badhate karj ne bhavishya kii pahalon ko adhar main chhod diya he or kuch had tak bharat ke rukh ko sahi sabit kiya he
 Rising funds, debt and lack of transparency have raised concerns in many host countries
 aakhirkaar parachhaaiyon se ghiri hukuumaton ke saath kaarobaar karnaa bhi "chini nazariye'' kaa hissaa he or isamen sthaneey samudaayon ko shaamil karne par bahut jor nahin diya jaataa
 This is the reason why local communities are protesting against Myitson Dam in Myanmar and Hambantota in Sri Lanka
 yah ab bhi aspasht he ki china kii kootneeti in jokhimon se nipatane ke liye paryaapt chatur-chaalaak he yaa nahin
 Xi is undoubtedly trying to do so, which is also evident from his complete reversal of China's diplomatic establishment
 march main neshnal piples congress main shi ne party-sarkaar ko nae sire se dhaalane ke liye puraa jor laga diya—isamen ab sipisi kii shakhaaen sakriy bhoomika nibhaaengi, jabaki pehle ve prishthbhumi main rahakar kaam karti thim
 The party, led by Xi, has set up a Central Foreign Affairs Commission, which will give the CPC a leading role in diplomacy against the Ministry of External Affairs — along with a new committee on national security, economic issues and reforms
 samudrapar pariyojnaon ko zyada ahmiyat or vajan dene ke liye unhone ek nai chini sahaayta agency kaa bhi elaan kiya
 Xi will be the chairman of this commission
 shie yanamei kahati hai, "kendriya satta ko zyada sakasham bananaa shi ke liye apane vijan ko saakaar karne kaa pramukh hathiyaar he
 All institutions are subordinate to the party and there will no longer be any competing centers which have their own power
 ''shi ke liye apane vijan ko aage badhaane main kamyaabi se desh ke bheetar party kii vaidhata main ijapha hoga or videshon main china kii haisiyat badhegi
 On the other hand, due to the convergence of power in them, the blame of failure will completely fall on them
 isse ooncha daanv or jokhim bhala or kya ho saktaa he

 ’ Anubhav Mittal, an accused in a 37 billion online fraud case in the name of social trading in Noida, is sending messages through social media to those who invest money in his company
 wo apane sadasyon ko bataa rahaa he ki usne sabhi ke paise release kiye hai, lekin ek raajnneetik dal or estf ne uski company ko band karaayaa he
 In the messages being sent to members by Anubhav Mittal, it is being told that everyone's payment has been released
 512karodarupee kii pament bank ko di gai he
 Everyone could get their payments on the due date, but due to pressure from the political party and STF, his company has been closed
 isi tarah ke kai sandesh anubhav kii company main paisa lagane waalon ko bheje ja rahe hai
 These are the messages - It is being said in the message that the political party wants experience to bribe those who do not want to give experience
 anubhav kaa kahana he ki vah ek number se paise kamaate hai to ghoose kyon denge?-raajnneetik party or virodhiyon ne media ko paisa dekar juthi news dikhaane ke liye kaha he
 They have plotted this huge plot
 jaaniye kaise
 Case filed on false complaint of a person named Dinesh
 jisaki vajah se anubhav sirf castady main hai
 He can miss the bell anytime, but he wants the truth to be revealed to everyone how social trade really works
 -yah mukadmaa STF ke ek karmchaaree dinesh, raajnneetik party, virodhiyon or media kii milijuli sajeesh he
 STF wants a lot of money to be made in this election environment
 -sandeshon main kaha ja rahaa he ki STF ko virodhiyon or raajnneetik party se pehle hi is kaam ke liye paisa mil chukaa he
 Now STF wants to make money from experience as well
 saath hi raajnneetik party bhi anubhav se paise einthna chaahati he
 - Experience in Custody has been heavily questioned
 is poochtacha main police ko pataa chalaa ki anubhav kaa vyavsaay ekadam clin he, or vah sarkaar ko baraabar tex pe kar rahe hai
 According to the messages, an STF man named Dinesh wants to withdraw the FIR, but now Anubhav will get the FIR back with the help of Supreme Court lawyers and restart the company
 is kaam main lagbhag ek hafte kaa vakt lagegaa
 Meanwhile, the political party, the STF and the opponents are stunned
 unki sajeesh or plan fail ho gaya
 He has called social trade a big scam, which is a big lie
 aap sab jaanate he ki company ne paisa NEFT se liya or NEFT se associats ko diya he
 And tax is also being paid equally
 -keval janvari maheene main site migration kii vajah se pament main thodi deree hui he
 Now STF, political party, opponents and media want associates and members to demand their money back from social trade, but it is seen that associates are demanding to start a company
 or ham saare member kah rahe kii media jhooth bol rahi he
 - Members are being appealed in the message that all members should be restrained in this watch and do not support false media, STF
 media or STF chaahati he ki ham anubhav mittal kii company kii shikaayat karen, taaki unako saboot mil jaae ki un par lagaae gaye aarope sahi hai
 -all members keep moderation and do not think negatively
 anubhav jald hi bahaar aa jaayenge or is sajeesh kaa bhandaphod karenge, or ham sabko paise regular milte rahenge

 33 seats had already been elected unopposed in 10 state seats
 shuukravaar ko hui 7 rajyon kii 26 siton par hue chunaav main bijepi ne 12 siton par jeet hasil kii he
 BJP was established in 1980
 sankhyabal ke lihaaj se rajyasabha main sabase badi party banane main use 38 saal lag gaye
 After the results of late Friday night, for the first time in history, BJP has crossed 73 seats
 bijepi dwaara jiti gai 12 siton main uttar pradesh main bijepi dwaara 9wein pratyaashee ke taur par utaare gaye anil agarwal bhi shaamil he
 The 9th seat was also an additional seat of the BJP, which saw high voltage drama throughout the day

 The BJP on Friday won 12 Rajya Sabha seats with one seat from Uttar Pradesh and one from Jharkhand, one from Chhattisgarh and one from Karnataka
 is tarah bijepi ne pehle is baar 10 siten adhik jiti he

 While there was a seat fixed on the number of SP mlas
 iske baad kisi bhi dal ke paas apane boote par rajyasabha kii ek seat jeetna kii sankhya nahin thi
 The BSP fielded its candidates with the support of SP and Congress
 lekin bijepi ke 9wein ummidavaar ke utarane se chunaav dilachasp ho gadha tha
 Every effort was made to win the tenth seat from both the ruling and the opposition
 cross voting kaa maamla saamne aayaa
 Apart from this, one BSP and one SP mlas were not allowed to cast their votes due to the jail term
 isi kaa nateeja tha ki dasvin seat par vipaksh ke saajhe ummidavaar bhimrao ambedkar ko haar kaa munh dekhnaa padaa
