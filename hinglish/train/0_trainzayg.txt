 But in Odisha, a mother forced to sell her newborn baby for 2000 rupees

 Geeta was passing through daily wages after her husband left
 ilaake ke duusare mazdooron kii tarah notebandi ke baad gita ko kaam milane main dikkat ho rahi thi, jabaki garbhavastha ke dauraan uskaa kharch bad gaya tha
 He had no other option to feed his 12-year-old daughter and 5-year-old son
 lihaaja gita ne padosi mamata sahu se apane bachche kaa sauda 2 hajaar rupee main kiya
 a forced mother! According to Geeta, due to poor financial condition, she could not raise this child and she was desperately in need of money for the education of other children apart from household expenses
 gita kaa kahana he ki maujuuda halaat main uske liye akele parivaar kaa jimmedaari uthaanaa mumkin nahin he
 Mamta Sahu's family, on the other hand, was looking for a boy to carry the name of his family
 mamata sahu ne bataaya, ‘meri sirf ek beti he
 So i had already assured from Geeta that if she gives birth to the boy then she will hand me over
 iske badale main maine use munhmaangi rakam deneka vaada kiya tha
 'after the news came into action, the district administration officials met Geeta and termed the deal as illegal
 jila kalyaan samiti ke chairman shishir routraay ne bataaya ki gita kaa parivaar behad garib he
 Due to shortage of money, Geeta could not give birth to the child in the hospital

 According to Rautray, medicines have been provided for his treatment
 prashasan ke dakhal ke baad mamata sahu ke parivaar ne bachche ko lautaa diya he
 Stinging question, however, the question still remains, how will Geeta find this child? Will it be sold again after the attention of the media and administration is removed from the case? Will the state government take action in this matter? When will poor families get basic health facilities in Odisha? The question is also how long will the poor families from Gita bear the brunt of demonetisation? In August last year, one such poor tribal had to shoulder his wife's body for about 10 km at Bhawanipatna in Kalahandi area

 police ko moti nagar ke rahane vaale ek shaks sahil ne shikaayat kii thi kii usne apni skuti online bechney ke liye ek website par uski photo post kii thi or saath main usne apana mobile nabanr bhi diya tha
 The complainant stated that two days after posting the photo, he received a call from the buyer who called his name Arjun
 kharidaar ne shikayatakarta ko skuti or uske kagajaat ke saath punjabi baag aane ko kaha
 Sahil reached Punjabi Bagh with the papers and scooty on time
 vahaan par thodi hi der main arjuna ek shaks ke saath pahunch gaya
 He first saw the papers, then started driving Scooty, asking to test drive the car
 sahil us vakt isliye nishcint tha kyunki use laga arjuna kaa saathi to uske saath hi he, lekin jab kaaphi der tak arjuna nahin lautaa to uske saath aayaa shaks vahaan se jane laga
 Upon which Sahil caught him and asked about Arjun, he told that he had met Arjun at a paan shop, and he said that let's go for a walk, i don't know much more

 The police then formed a team to capture Arjun
 police ko pataa laga ki aakhri baar uskaa number sangam vihaar main chalaa tha, jiske baad us team ne sangam vihaar main arjuna ke hulie or skuti ke bare main pataa karnaa shuru kiya to 18 dinon ke baad police aaropee tak pahunch saki

 Everyone was surprised, thinking and seeing if Robri could be in the train like this too? On the roof of the train's bogie, the robbers go inside the bogie, and from there fly about five crore rupees
 or ye sab kuch hota he chalati train main
 Not a single policeman in the looted bogie, the two bogies in the passenger train from Salem in Tamil Nadu, which had Rs 342 crore, had 18 policemen to protect the two bogies
 jinamein ek assistant kamishnar bhi tha
 Railway Police Force was responsible for security
 jiske 15 jawan train ke saath chal rahe the
 But there was no policeman inside the bogey in which the robbery took place
 bogi sil thi or suraksha jawan duusari bogi main baithe the, jinamein baaki ke rupee rakhe the
 As soon as this train arrives at Agnore railway station, then for the first time a railway employee's eye falls on the roof of this bogey
 chat main suraakh tha
 There was a robbery in the train, because it was one of the two bogies in which the Reserve Bank of India had kept 342 crores
 ab sawaal ye tha ki chalati train main aakhir daaka kaise padaa? kahaan par padaa? or is tarah daaka daalane vaale wo shaatir log koun hai? koun ho sakate hai?bogi kii chat par kiya surakhchennai pahunchane se pehle shaayad train main pad chuke is daaka kaa khulaasa bhi naa hota
 When the train reached Agnore railway station from Salem, the policemen opened the door of the bogie and started inspecting it inside
 or usee dauraan ek afasar ko tab bada ajeeb laga, jab usne dekha ki raat ke andhere main bhi bogi ke andar baahar se tej roshni aa rahi he
 After this, when a railway employee was sent to the roof of the bogie, it was found that the roof had been broken into
 darasal bogi kii lohe kii chat ko kisi welding yaa gas mashin se kaata gaya tha
 The width was so much that a man could get into the bogey from that hole with ease
 jaise hi is baat kaa ahsaas surakshabalon ko hua echanak hadakamp much gaya
 When a search of the box kept in the bogie was carried out after absconding with Rs 5 crore, it was found that there were a total of four boxes kept in the bogie which have been tampered with
 inamen se ek to puri tarah khaali tha
 While some notes were extracted from the rest of the box
 baad main saare box kii ginati kii gai to pataa chalaa ki kareeb paanch karod rupee gaayab hai
 That is, the robbers took five crore rupees with them
 bakse main rakhe zyaadaatar note hajaar, paanch sau or sau ke the
 There was a robbery in the train, now it was to find out how it happened? So after investigation, the investigation team has reached the same conclusion that the robbery in the train took place between Salem to Virdhachalam
 kyonki selem se viradhachalam ke bich 140 kilometre ke is trek par hi dijal ingine se train chalati he
 In such a situation, it was easy to cut the roof by climbing on the roof of the train
 jabaki elactryphoid root par hai tension taar ke neeche train kii chat par chadhana or chat main send lagaana mumkin hi nahin he
 There was a danger of electrocution
 haalanki ek duusari theory ye bhi aa rahi he ki train jab dijal ingine se elactic engine main tabdeel hone ke liye viradhachalam stesan par ek ghante rukii thi tab vahaan par bhi daaka pad saktaa he
 However, the police believe that this is unlikely, as it is extremely risky to climb the roof in the presence of the train standing at the station
 lut gaye sabhi note puranepulice kaa maananaa he ki is lut ke peeche kisi anduruni shaks kaa bhi haath ho saktaa he
 Who knew from which train, in which bogie, the money was going
 police is lut ke peeche uttar bharat ke kisi giroh kaa haath hone kii baat se bhi inkaar nahin kar rahi he
 However, the police also say that all the money that was robbed is before 2005 and the condition of many rupees is very bad
 kate fate note hai
 Therefore, even after the loot, it will not be so easy for the robbers to run that money in the market

 When her mother Indira Gandhi came to know about the love affair of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi with Sonia, she was also no less amazed and she informed a close relative about the affair of her son in a very interesting way

 On this, the Pandit said that certainly now all of us have become jerks

 According to Sathe, Rajiv Gandhi could not arrive on time due to the hectic schedule but Congress workers did not give up hope of his arrival

 Senior Congress leader said that after the public meeting, when his wife Jayashree Sathe asked Rajiv if you would like to eat food, he said that i will definitely eat because today i have not eaten food
 kisi ne mujhase khaane ke liye poocha hin nahin
 According to Sathe, after this Rajiv Gandhi went to the rest house in Wardha and ate there

 rajeev ne unase kaha tha ki saathe ji, in chunaavon main kai logon se kaaphi vicitra anubhav mili hai or chunaav ke baad aap mujhe ek badla hua vyakti paayenge
 He said that he could not understand what Rajiv meant, but sad news of his death was received only three days after the incident

 At Jawaharlal Nehru University, the bugle of the students' union election is over
 ek baar phir campus main vam sanghathan left unity panel se chunaav lard rahe hai
 For the past several years, Left organizations have been fighting elections together
 lekin pehali baar isa ne panel main apana adhyaksh pad pratyaashee nahin utaara
 This time the SFI (student Federation of India) is fielding its candidate for the post of president in the panel
 beete saal chaatrasangh president chune gaye isa ke n Sai Balaji ne ajtak se baatcheet main kaha ki AISA jeenyu kii samskruti ko bachaane ke liye har qurbaani dene ko taiyaar he
 IISA has been dominating the JNU campus for the past several years
 saal 2014 se pehle campus main sabhi vam sanghathan alag alag panel utarkar chunaav ladate the
 But, after the incident of 2016, Left student organizations used to come together and contest from a panel
 is panel main bhi isa hameshaa adhyaksh pad ke liye pratyaashee utaarata tha
 If sources are to be believed, the condition laid by CPIM to fight in the panel is being cited as the reason behind it
 bataa den ki 2016-17 chaatrasangh chunaav main left ne panel banaakar abivipi ko takkar di
 This was the period when Left organizations were accused of organizing programs on Afzal Guru and raising anti-national slogans on campus in February 2016
 tab us saal left ne pehali baad panel banaaya
 In this, AISA and SFI came together
 tab donon sanghathanon ne do-do siton par apane ummidavaar utaare
 In that panel, AISA was also fighting for the post of president
 daur aayaa 2017-18 kaa tab tak bhi modi sarkaar main jeenyu main left panel utana majbootee se khadaa nahin ho paaya tha
 Three organizations came together on the panel this year, with AISA, SFI and DSF
 tab isa ke naam do siten raheen
 Then in 2018-19, Left Unity fought with four organizations
 isamen isa, esefai, dsef ke saath esef bhi saath aa gaya tha
 In this election, AISA had contested only the post of president, but her candidate won by an overwhelming majority
 chaatrasangh nahin ho sakaa notifibeete saal jeenyu chaatrasangh chunaav bhale hi left panel ne jeet liya ho, lekin prashasan ne kabhi bhi unhen kisi mahatvapurn baithak main aamantrit nahin kiya
 Not only this, the administration did not even notify them by saying that they should not be given the right account
 chaatrasangh ke kai baar patr likhane ke baavjood unhen adhishuchet nahin kiya gaya
 Not only this, the day the results of the JNUSU election were announced, on the same day there was a lot of chaos between the left organization and ABVP on campus
 ab vajah kuch bhi ho lekin left wing main aapasi khinchataan ab saaf najar aa rahi he
 Now it remains to be seen who wins this election, what color the decision to field SFI candidates from Left Unity brings, however, both IISA and SFI organizations are saying that there is such a thing at the level of organization behind creating Left Unity Is not

 daawa- ayushmaan yojana ke baad kharaab hui aspataalon kii sthitivitt mantralay kii ore se unka 1600 karod kaa bhugtan bakidesh ke privet aspataalon ne central garvament health screem (CGHS) or eks sarviceman contributory health skim (ECHS) ke tahat 'cashles' sevaayen band karne kii chetavanee di he
 This warning has been given by the Association of Private Hospitals as their payment of 1600 crores is hanging by the Union Finance Ministry
 july main ek patr ke madhyam se vitt mantralay ko aspataalon kii bakaayaa raashi kaa byoraa bheja gaya tha, lekin koi nateeja nahin niklaa
 Now hospitals are thinking about taking tough action on this matter, due to which schemes like CGHS and ECHS can be affected
 association kaa daawa he ki modi sarkaar kii ayushmaan bharat universal healthcare skim lagu hone ke baad sthiti kharaab ho gai he
 In a recent meeting of the Association of Healthcare Providers of India (AHPI), it was decided that the 'cashless' service to CGHS and ECHS beneficiaries would be discontinued if the central government did not approve the payment of outstanding bills
 association ke diarector general giradhar gyani ne kaha, "pichley teen saalon se aspataalon kaa bhugtan lataka hua he kyonki in yojanaon ke tahat aspataalon kii sankhya bad gai he jabaki bilon ko manjuuri dene ke liye bajet pehle jitna hi he
 "he said," After the implementation of Ayushman Bharat Scheme, the situation worsened and the outstanding amount has reached 1600 crores
 " unhone kaha ki "ham jaldi hi mantralay or sambandhit adhikariyon ko patr likhane ja rahe hai ki agar hamaare nuksaan kii bharpai ke liye koi apaat kaarywahi nahin kii gai to ham in yojanaon ke tahat di ja rahi sevaaon ko band karne ke liye majaboor honge
 "in July, a memorandum was sent to the Ministry of Finance on behalf of private hospitals which yielded no results
 iske baad ab aspataalon ne yah faisla kiya he
 The association had told the ministry in its letter that these schemes are also losing their importance to beneficiaries and hospitals due to non-payment of dues for a long time
 aspataalon kaa bakaayaa bhugtan badi chintaa he
 The hospitals had signed the agreement based on the terms of the CGHS scheme, which came into effect from 1 October 2014
 yojana main praavdhaan he ki aspataal jo bill lagaayenge, uskaa 70 fisadi bhugtan paanch kaarydiwason ke andar kiya jayega
 In no case, payment was made within the stipulated time
 aspataalon ko bhugtan ke liye maheenon se lekar saalon tak intjaar karnaa pad rahaa he
 Because of this, there is a situation of instability in hospitals and hospitals are refusing to treat the La Bharishis
 association ne apane patr main chetaya he ki mantralay jab tak badi maatra main raashi jari nahin karata, tab tak bakaayaa usee bracket main bana rahegaa
 The association said, "if you pay attention to this long-pending payment, we would be grateful to you
" yah bakaayaa aspataalon main asthi rata kii sthiti paidaa kar rahaa he
 The government's flagship schemes like Ayushman Bharat are also having a bad effect as hospitals are not coming forward to work under those schemes due to fear that they will not be paid in time
 "agar privet aspataal apni is ghoshnaa par amal karte hai to central government ke 37 lakh labhaarthi CGHS ke tahat or 52 lakh eks sarviceman ECHS ke tahat prabhavit honge
 Presently these beneficiaries receive services under these schemes in 1000 hospitals and nursing homes
 jin aspataalon kaa sabase zyada bakaayaa he unamem maiks healthcare kaa 150 karod or fortis group kaa 58 karod bakaayaa he
 An association official said, "reacting to the problem of payment of dues, the Union Health Ministry has issued a memo seeking suggestions from all stakeholders to improve the CGHS scheme and revive it
 lekin hamaari chintaaon par swasthya mantralay ne ek bhi shabd main kuch nahin kaha

 khitaab ke prabal daavedaar bharat ne somvaar ko pool di ke apane antim match main dakshin africa ko 2-1 se haraakar apana vijay abhiyaan jari rakhaa or badi shaan ke saath purush junior hockey vishwa cap ke quarter final main kadam rakhaa
 Captain Harjeet Singh (11th minute) and Mandeep Singh (55th minute) scored for India, while the only goal for South Africa was scored by Kyle Lion Kachet (28th minute)
 bharat ne is tarah se pool main teen jeet se nau ank ke lekar quarter final main jagah banaai jahaan uskaa saamana guuruuvaar ko pool si se duusare sthaan par rahe spain se hoga
 Initially the match seemed one sided, as India took an aggressive approach which allowed South Africa to devote all its strength to saving the goal
 bharat ne lagaataar hamale kiye lekin pratidwandvi team ne bhi unke prayaason ko naakaam karne main kasar nahin chodi
 India were successful in the last minute in the 11th minute, while captain Harjeet scored a goal from Manpreet Jr's move from the left end
 bharat ne iske baad bhi dabaav banaae rakhaa or iske chah minute baad use apana pehla penlti corner mila lekin harmanpreet singh ke shaat ko dakshin africa golkeeper siyavuya nolushungu ne bachaa diya
 South Africa secured their first penalty corner in the 27th minute after being on the back foot for most of the first half
 kyle line kachet ne bhartiya golkeeper vikaas dahia ko chhakaakar is par gol karke score 1-1 se baraabar kar diya
 India maintained an aggressive attitude even after the intermission but missed a golden opportunity to score again in 45 minutes
 gurjant ne gend nikaant sharma ko saunpi jinka karaara shaat golkeeper ne khubasurat tareeke se bachaa diya
 The advantage of India's consistent attacks earned him a third penalty corner in the 49th minute which Nikanth could not properly stop but the reverse shot was blocked very well by the South African goalkeeper on the second occasion
 tippaniyan Desperate to win in front of the home audience, India took the lead in the 55th minute with a brilliant goal from Mandeep
 mandeep ne harjit ke karaara shaat jamaakar use jaali main uljhaayaa
 South Africa had a golden opportunity to equalize the score three minutes before Hooters sounded
 usne penlti carnor hasil kiya lekin vah ise gol main nahin badal paaya
 The defeat also ended South Africa's hopes of reaching the quarter-finals as it needed a win to keep its hopes alive

 ) shuru main match ekatarfa lag rahaa tha, kyonki bharat ne aakraamak ravaiya apanaaya jisase dakshin africa ne apni puri takat gol bachaane main laga di
 India attacked relentlessly but the rival team also spared no effort to thwart their efforts
 bharat ko aakhri main 11wein minute main safalataa mili jabaki captain harjit ne manpreet junior ke baayen chor se banaae gaye move par karaara shot lagaakar gol kiya
 India kept the pressure even after that and six minutes later, they got their first penalty corner, but Harmanpreet Singh's shot was saved by South African goalkeeper Siyavuya Nolushungu
 pehle hof main adhiktar samay baikfoot par rahane ke baad dakshin africa ne 27wein minute main apana pehla penlti corner hasil kiya
 Kyle Lyon Kacchet smacked Indian goalkeeper Vikas Dahiya and scored on it to equalize the score at 1-1
 madhyantar ke baad bhi bharat ne aakraamak ravaiya barkaraar rakhaa lekin 45 minute main usne phir se gol karne kaa sunaharaa avasar ganvaaya
 Gurjant handed the ball over to Nikant Sharma, whose beautiful shot was saved beautifully by the goalkeeper
 bharat ke lagaataar hamalon ke phaayde se use 49wein minute main teesraa penlti carnor mila jise nikaant sahi tarah se stop nahin kar paye lekin duusare maukey par reverse shaat ko dakshin africa golkeeper ne bahut acchhee tarah se use roak diya

 ) agar aap hero motocorp kii bike kharidne kii soch rahe hai to aapke liye ek buree khabar he
 In fact, the country's largest two-wheeler company Hero motocorp has increased the prices of its bikes and scooters by up to 1 percent
 hero motocorp kii ore se jari bayaan main kaha gaya, ''vibhinn dopahiyaa maadlon kii showrooms keemat par 1 fisadi kii vruddhi kii gai he
 There may be some differences depending on the model and market
 '' hero kii bike yaa scooter ke alag-alag modells par nai keemat lagu ho chuki he
 After this decision of the company, customers will now have to loose more pockets than before
 haalanki, hero kii ore se nai keemton main badhotaree kii vajah nahin bataai gai he
 For example, for example, the showroom price of Hero's Splendor Plus in Delhi was 50 thousand 210 rupees
 ab is keemat main 1 fisadi tak kaa ijapha ho gaya he
 After this, the new price of this model becomes 50 thousand 712 rupees
 kehane kaa matlab yah he ki Splendor Plus kharidne ke liye graahakon ko pehle ke mukaable atirikt 500 rupee tak dene pad sakate hai
 Similarly, the prices of different models of bikes or scooties have increased
 1 july se mahangi ho chuki hai karembta den ki 1 july se mahindra and mahindra (M&M) ne bhi apni paisanger kaaron kii keemten 1 july se badha di hai
 Similarly, Maruti Suzuki India's compact sedan car Dzire announced an increase of up to Rs 12,690
 iske alaava honda kii kaaren bhi 10,000 se 20,000 rupee tak mahangi ho gai thim
 Most car companies have increased prices citing safety

 However, the estimated figures of Monday's earnings are coming out
 haalanki isamen shuruyaat ke teen dinon vaala trend hi najar aa rahaa he
 Collections are estimated around 10 million on Monday
 jabaki trade exparts ne anumaan lagaaya tha ki film 20 karod kama legi
 The film, released on Friday, had a much worse debut in the Indian market than expected
 film ne pehle din 20
 14 crores, 18 on the second day
 22 karod, tisare din yani ravivaar ko mahaj 20
 71 crores
 agar somvaar ke anumaanit aankade jod die jaae to film bharat main ab tak mahaj 69 karod karod kamaane main kaamyaab hui he
 The film is moving very hard towards 100 crores in the first week
 kya christmas kaa milegaa phydab trade export kii nazren christmas ke collection par hongi
 According to estimates, the film can earn twenty five million or more on this day
 haalanki kamai kaa trend bahut kharaab rahaa he or use dekhte hue aisa sambhav nahin lagata
 Now it will be interesting to see if the tickets for Santa Shahrukh Khan will show happiness at the window

 com / nk7oxdpvds BJP-SS government re-formed in Maharashtra Shiv Sena again asked for the post of CM, NCP had last time supported the Bharatiya Janata Party and Shiv Sena duo in Maharashtra once again got majority
 paanch saal pehle donon partiyaan alag chunaav ladi thim, lekin is baar donon saath chunaav ladiin
 BJP emerged as the largest party, but miracle did not happen like last time
 bijepi kii takat kamjor hui to shivasena ne apni aawaaj main dam badhaayaa he or ankhen tarerana shuru kar diya he
 But whether the BJP will be ready to bow before the Shiv Sena, everyone's eye is on it
 yaa ek baar phir paanch saal pehle jaisaa nazaaraa milegaa, jahaan ensipi ne donon ke bich main entry maar di thi
 After the results, the Shiv Sena showed that after the results on Thursday, when the Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray came in front of the media, he repeated the same thing again and said that this time will be carried forward on the formula of 50-50 and in no way
 Will be bent
 vahiin devendra fadanvis ne bhi bayaan diya tha ki shivasena se jo tay hua he, vahi hoga abhi bhi pehle jaisi hi sthiti he
 What has weakened BJP in Maharashtra? After Shiv Sena results, adopting such aggressive attitude is also coming because bjp's seats have reduced this time
 2014 main akele dam par ladane vaali bijepi ne 122 siten hasil kii thim, lekin is baar bijepi 105 hi jeet pai
 However, Shiv Sena has also given its seats this time and has come down to 56 from the figure of 63
 mukhyamantri pad ke liye adegi shivasena yaa phir
 
 
 The Shiv Sena had demanded Aditya Thackeray to be the chief minister during the election campaign, but the number of seats he has won does not seem to be possible
 lekinshivsena ab bhi 50-50 ke formule par ad gai he
 In such a situation, what will she do for the post of CM will be worth seeing
 lekin shivasena ke liye ye itnaa aasaan bhi nahin hoga, kyonki 2014 main jab shivasena ne bijepi ke saath sarkaar banane se inkaar kiya tha tab ensipi ne ek kadam aage badhaate hue sthir sarkaar ke liye bijepi kaa saath dene kii baat kahi thi
 After which the Shiv Sena came under pressure and it joined the BJP
 ab ek baar phir waisi hi sthiti he, shivasena bijepi par dabaav bana rahi he
 But will the NCP once again run its five-year-old bet
 By not focusing the benefits of # unionbudget2016 on the # suitboot people @arunjaitley has cleverly made the opposition's job a bit tougher
 If the Union Budget were like annual exams for PM Shri @narendramodi then i must say he has passed the exams with flying colors
 isse pehle ravivaar ko modi ne radio par prasasit apane kaarykram 'man kii baat' main kaha tha ki 'main bhi kal ek pariksha duungaa
 One hundred and fifty million people of the country will take my exam
 ' The government, which is trying to form a general opinion on the Land Acquisition Bill, has indicated softening on an important provision of the bill
 sutron ke mutabik sarkaar ne sansad kii sanyukti samiti kii baithak main sadasyon ko bataaya he ki zamin adhigrahan kanoon main audyogic galiyare (industrial coridor) ke tahat zamin lene kii koi zarurat nahin he
 This thing is very important from the government, because the amendment that the government is bringing in the current bill, it is proposed to take one kilometer of land on both sides of the highway for the industrial corridor
 ab sawaal he ki kya is praavdhaan ko dhilaa karegi? lekin abhi ye saaf nahin he ki kya sarkaar 2013 main bane kanoon par laayaa gaya sanshodhan waapas legi?tippaniyan According to sources, the provision of taking land on both sides of the linear project such as highway and rail can be loosened or removed
 is bill main adhyadesh ke tahat kiye gayi sanshodhano ko lekar lagaataar vivaad ho rahaa he
 The government does not have a majority in the Rajya Sabha to get the bill passed
 isaliye is bill par sarkaar ko baar-baar adhyadesh laana pad rahaa he jisase uski kaaphi aalochana hui he
 The Committee of Parliament has to submit its report by 3 August
 isaliye sarkaar vivaadit muddon par sulah karne kii koshish main he
 It has asked the states to give complete relaxation in the rules for drafting the bill and fixing compensation
 sarkaar kii ore se kahi gai ye baat kaaphi mahatvapurn he kyonki maujuuda bill main sarkaar jo sanshodhan laa rahi he usamen industrial coridor ke liye hive ke donon ore ek kilometre zamin liye jane kaa prastaav he
 Now the question is whether this will loosen the provision? But it is not clear yet whether the government will withdraw the amendment brought on the law made in 2013? sutron ke mutabik hive auki rail jaise leniyar project ke donon ore zamin lene ke praavdhaan ko dhilaa kiya ja saktaa he yaa phir hataaya ja saktaa he
 In this bill, there has been continuous controversy over the amendments made under the ordinance
 sarkaar ke paas rajyasabha main bill ko paas karwaane ke liye bahumat nahin he
 Therefore, the government has to bring an ordinance on this bill again and again, due to which it has been criticized a lot
 sansad kii samiti ko 3 agast tak apni report deni he
 That is why the government is trying to settle the contentious issues
 usne rajyon ko bill ke praaroop ko banane auki muawza tay karne ke niyamon main puri chhot deni kii baat kahi he

 (input-bhashaa) Vinayak Damodar Savarkar's name is among the few people associated with the freedom struggle who have been created all kinds of myths and stories
 rashtriya swayamsevak sangh, jo aaj kii taarikh main khud ko saavarkar kii viraasat kaa pratinidhi bataata he, unke jiiteji saavarkar se uske rishte utane sahaj nahin the jitna daawa kiya jaataa he
 Today, on the death anniversary of Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, we try to know what were the issues on which the Sangh and Savarkar's stance was opposite to each other
 mahasabha kii yuva ikai banane se sangh kaa inkaaravinayak damodar saavarkar hindu mahasabha ke netaa the
 The Hindu Mahasabha was established in 1915 after the establishment of the Muslim League in 1906
 jiskaa lakshya british hukumat main hindu hiton kii raksha karnaa tha
 Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh was founded by some leaders of the Mahasabha 10 years after the Hindu Mahasabha was founded
 is lihaaj se hindu mahasabha ko sangh kaa matra sanghathan bhi kaha ja saktaa he
 The leaders of the General Assembly wanted the Sangh to function as their youth unit
 lekin mahasabha kaa yah plan puraa nahin ho paaya or saavarkar se netritv nen mahasabha kii yuva ikai ram sena kii sthapana kii gai
 Walter wanted to form a political party against Congress
 anderson or shridhar daamale dwaara likhi gai kitaab 'di brotherhud in safran, di aresas and di hindu rivivelism' main daawa kiya gaya he ki saavarkar hindu mahasabha ko congress ke khilaaf raajnneetik dal main badalanaa chaahate the
 While the founder of the RSS, Keshav Baliram Hedgewar had already decided that the RSS would work as a cultural organization rather than participate in active politics against the Congress
 saavarkar or sangh ke bich ek samay matbhed itane gahare ho gaye the ki saavarkar ne hindu mahasabha ke kaaryakartaaon ko sangh chhodane kii hidaayat de di thi
 The mention goes through a letter written by Savarkar on 3 March 1943
 bharat chodo andolanazaadee ke itihaas ke pannon main 1942 kaa bharat chodo andolan ek mahatvapurn padaav ke taur par darj he
 When Britain was joining World War II and Mahatma Gandhi led the Quit India Movement
 is dauraan puure desh ne is andolan main bad-chadh kar hissaa liya lekin aresas ne khud ko is andolan se dur rakhaa
 But Savarkar went a step further and visited other parts of the country during this period and called upon the Hindu youth to join the British army
 dwi raashtra siddhantadilli uniwarsity ke professor shamsul islam kii kitaab main ye zikr miltaa he ki saal 1937 main hindu mahasabha ke 19wein adhiveshan main saavarkar ne kaha tha ki aaj yah katai nahin mana ja saktaa ki hindustan ekta main piroyaa hua raashtra he, iske vipareet hindustan main mukhyatah do raashtra hai, hindu or musalmaan
 While the Muslim League under the leadership of Muhammad Ali Jinnah demanded a separate nation for Muslims in 1940 as Pakistan
 itihaas main ise dwi raashtra siddhant ke taur par janaa jaataa he
 Not only this, on August 15, 1943, Savarkar had said in Nagpur, 'I have no quarrel with Mr
 Jinnah's Two Nation Theory
 ham, hindu, swayan main ek raashtra hai or ye aitihaasik tathy he ki hindu or muslim do raashtra hai
 Controversy over 'hindutva' The term 'hindutva' claimed to be the leader in today's date originated from Savarkar's pen
 hindutv vichaardhaara ke janak saavarkar ne is siddhant kaa pratipaadan 'hindutv' naamak ke granth main kiya
 Initially, even though Savarkar and the RSS may have gone ahead with this concept of Hindutva, later the RSS changed its stance and now the Sangh believes that every person living in India is a Hindu
 jabaki saavarkar ke hindu raashtra kii paribhaasha ke mutabik isai or musalmaan zyaadaatar haal tak hindu the or ve apni pehali peedi main nae dharm ke anuyaayi bane hai
 Savarkar believes that even though these people claim shared fatherland, origin and culture from us, they cannot be recognized as Hindus
 gau-hatya or saavarkarbahut kam logon ko pataa hoga ki hindutv ko paribhaashit karne vaale saavarkar ek naastik the
 The RSS and BJP are at the forefront of the ongoing politics in the country regarding cow
 lekin gaay ko lekar savkar kii soch ekadam alag thi kyonki ve gaay ko ishvariya maanane ke bajaay sirf ek pashu maanate the
 Savarkar said that if you want to make maximum use of the cow, then you have to stop making it a god
 ishwar sabase upar he
 Then the human comes and the animal under it
 gaay bhi ek jaanavar he, jiske paas murkh manushya se bhi kam buddhi he
 If we consider cow as a god, then it would be an insult to humans
 gaay kii seva karo, kyonki ye upyogi he
 But when it becomes a burden in the days of war or when it becomes a burden, there is no reason not to kill it
 gandhi kii hatyaazaadee ke baad bhi saavarkar or sangh ke rishte kuch khaas achche nahin rahe
 The Hindutva organization RSS and the Hindu Mahasabha were banned after Mahatma Gandhi's assassination
 jiske baad court main is maamle kii sunwaayee ke dauraan donon sanghathanon main matbhed or ubhar kar saamne aae
 Not only did the RSS write letters to the then Home Minister Sardar Patel to lift the ban on himself, as well as advocate for Savarkar and his colleagues in the court case
 saavarkar kii moutaaj jis saavarkar kii viraasat par rashtriya swayamsevak sangh apana daawa karata he, kabhi unheen hindu raashtra ke purodha savkar ne jab aamaran anshan kiya to sangh ne unhen akelaa chhod diya tha
 Savarkar's nephew and Hindu Mahasabha leader Vikram Savarkar had said in one of his interviews that he was well aware that BJP and RSS do not appreciate Savarkar's philosophy
 bijepi or aresas kaa saavarkar ke prati achaanak ubhara prem dhokhaa he

 Riteish was supposed to perform the dance with full fervor on the occasion of Ganesh Chaturthi festival with Banjo's team, the makers of the film built a 40-foot-high drum and this 40, to make the song even more interesting
 Ritesh Deshmukh gave his performance by standing on the drum of feet

 ajay devgan (ajay Devgn) kii film 'de de pyaar de (de De Pyaar De)' kii kamai ko dekhakar lag rahaa he ki is weekend main film 80 karod kii kamai kaa aankada aasaani se paar kar legi
 The film is doing well in Delhi NCR and East Punjab
 'de de pyaar de (de De Pyaar De)' film se ajay devgan (ajay Devgn), tabboo (tabu) or rakul preet singh (rakul Preet Singh) ne dhamal machaa diya he
 Ajay Devgn (ajay Devgn) film 'de De Pyaar De' is the story of 50-year-old Ajay Devgan who is separated from his wife
 ajay devgan ko 26 saal kii rakul preet se ishk ho jaataa he
 This unique love story flows throughout the boom
 ajay devgan apni is yuva saathi ke saath apni purv patni or bacchon ke paas pahunchataa he
 a strange story begins after that
 pehla half kuch hansaata he lekin duusare half main aisa lagata he ki diarector ko samaj nahin aa rahaa he ki jo raita unhone failaayaa he, use kaise samete
 The pace of the film becomes very slow
 screenple bhi behad kharaab he
 If we look at the acting front, Rakul Preet Singh manages to win the heart
 film kii jaan rakul preet singh hai or jab bhi ve screen par aati hai, darshakon ke chehre par chamak daud jaati he
 Tabu has done a good acting, but Ajay Devgn is not very involved in this role, and in the case of acting, he seems to be out there
 kul milakar unki acting bahut hi everej rahi he
 It can also be said that they seem misfit somewhere in this role, the direction of 'de De Pyaar De' is very weak and the story is also derailed

 The formula for the procession of Dalit youth in Nizampur in Kasganj district of Uttar Pradesh has been decided
 dalit samudaay ke yuvak sanjay kumaar 20 april ko hone vaali apni shaadi ke dauraan ghodi se baraat nikaalnaa chaahate the
 The police was not allowing this due to the fear of the Savarna community, because not a single Dalit groom has come to this village on a mare in the procession
 savarna samudaay ke log dalit yuvak ke ghodi par baraat nikaalane ke khilaaf the
 But now due to the mediation of the district administration, the two sides have reached an agreement
 iske baad ab ghumaavdaar raste vaale root se hokar sanjay kii baraat gujaregi
 On April 20, Sanjay Kumar of Hathras district of Baratup is to be married to Sheetal on April 20 in Nizampur, Kasganj
 iske liye sanjay kumaar ne sthaneey police se sampark kar baraat nikaalane kii anumati maangi thi, lekin police ne anumati dene se manaa kar diya
 Police said that the area belongs to upper caste people, due to the procession of Dalits there, there may be violence
 samjhaute kaa modekeb jila prashasan kii madhyasthata ke chalate samjhauta ho gaya he, jiske baad dalit yuvak sanjay jatav baraat lekar 20 april ko nijaampur aayega
 Under the agreement, a map has been passed, through which the procession will pass
 is raste ko nakshe main pile rang se dikhaaya gaya he
 Apart from this, some terms and conditions have been fixed for the procession, which has been accepted by both the parties
 baraat kaa rodmapaprashasan ke samjhaute ke baad dalit yuvak kii baraat kaa janavasa gaanv ke baahar qutubpur jane vaale mukhyamarg par dharmaveer ke khet main rahegaa
 The procession will depart Janwasa from qutubpur-nizampur road through village Tirahe in front of the primary school, from Mahesh Chauhan's house in front, Sarendra Chauhan's house in the west direction to Satyapal's house
 gaanv main baraat jis gali se gujaregi, vah kaaphi sakari he
 Due to this, they will voluntarily use such vehicles and means, which can easily go out of the street
 baraat main koi netaa shaamil nahin hogasamjhaute main ye bhi tay hua he ki baraat main koi bhi raajnneetik \ araajnneetik sanghathan se sambandhit vyakti shaamil nahin hoga
 Apart from this, no person will also be involved with carrying weapons
 iske alaava koi maadak padaarth kaa seven nahin karegaa
 No person shall use the word offensive
 jile main dhara 144 lagu he
 Because of this, no person will use such language in the procession, which is likely to disturb the peace
 ajtak dalit ek bhi baraat nahin chadhigauratlab he ki kasganj ke nijaampur ilaake main vadhoo kaa ghar he, us ilaake main 40 daliton ke ghar hai jabaki 300 ucch jati ke log rahete hai
 Surprisingly, in the village where the procession is to be held, till date the bridegroom has not come on a horse in the procession of Dalits
 jila prashasan ne samjhaute ke tahat ek rodmap banaaya he, jiske tahat dulhan ke ghar tak baraat jaaegi

 ’ In 2004, the NDA government led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee lost the Lok Sabha elections
 unka “india shining” naaraa desh ke matadaataaon ke gale nahin utraa tha
 Sonia Gandhi and other non-nda parties formed the United Progressive Alliance (UPA)
 isaki adhyaksh khud sonia gandhi thim
 There was every possibility of Sonia becoming Prime Minister and holding 7 Race Course Road
 lekin sonia ke pradhanmantri banane ko lekar khud gandhi parivaar ekamat nahin tha
 This was strongly opposed by Rahul Gandhi
 rahul ko dar tha ki pradhanmantri banane par unki maa kii bhi unki daadi or pita kii tarah hatya kar di jaaegi
 Rahul was adamant to his point that he had clearly said that he would do anything to stop his mother from becoming Prime Minister
 rahul drudh ichhashakti ke vyakti hai or unki yah baat mahaj dhamkee nahin thi
 He gave Sonia 24 hours to take a decision in this regard
 us maukey par mere alaava manmohan singh, suman dube, priyanka bhi maujuud the
 Sonia was very worried and sad
 ek maa hone ke naate unke liye rahul kii baat kii andekhi karnaa asambhav tha
 And what happened was what Rahul wanted
 sonia gandhi ke pradhanmantri nahin ban paane kaa yahi ekmaatr kaaran tha
 Only me and Manmohan Singh knew about Sonia's decision
 baad main, sonia ne ek baithak bulaai
 In it she announced that she wanted Manmohan Singh to become Prime Minister
 ek baar maine is mudde par sonia ke saath thitholi bhi kii thi
 i told him that there are only two people in history who have rejected the Taj and both are Italian
 is par sonia ne poocha tha, ‘doosraa koun he?,” meraa jawaab tha, ‘julius sijar

 He later said "it was an important meeting", but insisted that he was not in the running for the next chief minister of the state
 or vah sahi the, kyonki jahaan ve khadey the, vahaan koi daud nahin thi
 After a few hours, he was declared the new Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh and the next day he took charge of the country's most populous state
 vah tab se kaam par hai
 Today, she is headed to her home in Gorakhpur
 or vah yogi adityanath nahin hai, jinhone pichley hafte purvi uttar pradesh ke 6 lakh logon kaa shahar chhod diya tha
 He is 'adityanath Yogi', as the name plate outside his bungalow in Lucknow and the government's website tells about him
 hajaaron log jo yogi ke swaagat ke liye gorakhpur kii sadakon par kataron main khadey hai yaa unke waapas aane par swaagat karte hording lagaae gaye hai, ko vastav main isse koi fark nahin padataa
 It is the city that has chosen the bjp's saffronier controversial Hindutva face for nearly two decades
 2014 loksabhaa chunaav main, purv kii tarah hi, adityanath ko apane sabhi pratidwandviyon se kahin zyada vot mili
 It is also the constituency that Adityanath introduced as a model for the rest of Uttar Pradesh in his farewell address to Parliament
 unhone kaha tha ki gorakhpur main vyapaariyon ko gunda tex nahin dena padataa
 Doctors are not kidnapped
 sthaneey log, netaa, vyapaaree koi bhi yah sunishchit karne kaa mauka nahin chhod rahe hai ki mukhyamantri ko bhavy swaagat mili
 There is a saffron wave in the city and every person has put up posters to welcome them
 ek kone main, kuch karmchaaree abhi bhi adhik hording kaa nirmaan kar rahe hai
 The traders' association and community leaders who want to present the bouquet to Yogi (first stop of Adityanath's convoy) on Maharana Pratap College were so long that the district administration had to decide the hierarchy by making a list
 tippaniyan After a meeting with his supporters, the first day of the Chief Minister's visit here will end with a program at Gorakhnath Math, where he is a Mahant, after meeting district officials about development in eastern Uttar Pradesh
 math ke prabandhak dwarka tiwari ne kaha ki padosi jilo se bhi log mukhyamantri ko dekhne aae hai
 District police officials said security has been beefed up, and police have taken all steps, including the deployment of drones to keep a close watch
 aaj, vah apane ghar gorakhpur kii ore agrasar hai
 And he is not Yogi Adityanath, who left the city of 6 lakh people in eastern Uttar Pradesh last week
 vah 'adityanath yogi' hai, jaisaa kii lakhanu main unke bangale ke baahar lagi nem plate or sarkaar kii website unke bare main bataa rahi he

 He said that in Gorakhpur, traders do not have to give goonda tax

 The local people, leaders, businessmen are leaving no chance to ensure that the Chief Minister gets a grand welcome
 shahar main bhagava lahar he or har ek vyakti ne unka swaagat karne ke liye poster lagaae hai

 According to mcd's Director of Information and Public Relations, Yogendra Singh Mann, the corporation is giving batches to the councilors for the first time so that their identity can be ensured
 aapako bataa den ki kai baar civik centre main parshadon ke saath unke samarthak orkaryakartabhi bedadak ghus jate hai

 Its light can also be lighted by remote during the night
 duusari taraf sabavufar kii baat karen to iskaa luk bhi kaaphi shandaar he
 It also complements the soundbar
 yahaan 6
 a 5-inch base driver is present which is down firing
 sabavufar or soundbar donon hi wireles tareeke hi seconds main hi conect ho jate hai
 That is, the account of plug and play will remain here
 haalanki donon ko alag-alag socket main plag karne kii jarurat rahegi
 The special thing is that they can be kept separately
 savabufar ko soundbar se conect karne ke liye keval sabavufar ke back main die gaye batan ko dabaanaa hoga
 After that they auto connect
 soundbar kii vajan thodaa zyada lag saktaa he, lekin isaki parformens bhi kamaal kii he
 Talking about the remote that comes with it, it is made of premium plastic
 isamen maujuud batan kaaphi kam or aasaani se dikhne vaale rakhe gaye hai
 They are very easy to operate
 yahaan aapako base kam zyada kaa opshan milegaa, saround on karne ke liye batan milegaa alag-alag sound mod main jane ke liye bhi batan milegaa
 The remaining buttons will be standard
 chuninda spacifications kii baat karen to isaki maximum power output 300W or frequency rispons 40hz tu 20khz he
 Bluetooth version 4 for wireless connectivity in it
 2 kaa saport diya gaya he
 That is, connect it only with Bluetooth and enjoy the audio and video content of your choice
 parformens:ab isaki parformens par baat karen to sabase pehle ise conect karnaa bahut hi aasaan he
 If you talk about Bluetooth connectivity, once connected to a device , it auto-connects within seconds 
 audio quality kii baat karen to ise mujeec, film or game ke liye alag-alag samajhnaa hoga
 Talking about music, here you get great sound quality through powerful subwoofers and tweeters present in the soundbar
 remote main maujuud sinc opshan, sound mod or base ko kam-zyada kar is effect ko or bhi badha sakate hai
 For good audio quality, you should be at some distance from the soundbar and subwoofer, otherwise the sound of the soundbar may be more loud
 ek taraf jahaan aapako sabavufar se behtareen base milegaa to duusari taraf soundbar se crispi hai nots milenge
 The finishing that you get from jbl's PA audio system is also found here in the soundbar
 haalanki isaki overol diteling ko kisi studio monitor se tulana nahin kar sakate, kyonki instruments kii waisi diteling aapako nahin milegi
 i think i can consider it better for the base
 sabavufar kaa dizin bhi aisa he ki isamen drivers neeche kii taraf die gaye hai jisase soft base miltaa he or wibrasion bhi miltaa he
 Talking about some shortcomings, you can feel the difficulty of channel separation while playing games and watching movies
 movie kii behtareen philing ke liye saround on karnaa sahi rahegaa
 Keep in mind that if the audio quality of the content is not better then it will also reflect in the speaker and you can also check the audio quality separately from Bluetooth, HDMI and audio jacks
 ek dikkat or ye ki yahaan 4K pasthru maujuud nahin he, joki is keemat ke soundbar main hona chahie tha
 Nowadays 4K TV models are coming in the budget anyway
 faisla:to ab sawaal ye he ki kya aapako is soundbar main paise lagane chahie? to jawaab ye he ki aap movie or mujeec jaisi jaruraton ke liye JBL is soundbar par bharosa kar paisa laga sakate hai
 Here you will find products with crisp audio quality as well as premium look and design
 channel sepperation jaisi kuch dikkatein bhi hai jo aapako kuch had tak niraash kar sakati hai
 But the biggest thing is that for this you will have to pay more money
 kyonki isse bhi kam keemat par samsung, soni or alji jaisi companiyon ke 5
 You get up to 1 home theater
 aise main ek baar aap kisi paas ke store main jaakar kharidne se pehle audio quality kii testing kar sakate hai

 The first phase of the investigation and trial of the aarushi-hemraj double murder case has been completed
 adaalat ne apana insaaf suna diya
 So is this case over now? Or is that the beginning of the finish case? Is it a strange story that for the last five and a half years, those hands were demanding justice, whose doubts were the biggest spots of doubt
 ye wo haath the, jinhone aarushi ko 14 saal tak paala-posa, bada kiya, uske naaz-nakhre uthaayee tamaam jiden puri kin, par aaj unheen haathon ko insaaf ne kaatil tehra diya
 The biggest question is on the Talwar couple themselves
 tamaam tarah kii chijen saharne ke baad bhi pichley saadhe paanch barason main donon kii koshish main jaraa-si bhi kanpakapaahat dikhaai nahin di
 There was an attempt to raise justice in the dock amidst the dark shadow of doubt
 yun lagata tha jaise donon ne thaan lee ho ki dekhen insaaf bada he yaa saazish?or in donon kii is koshish kaa saath kai shaq or sawaalon ne bhi diya
 The question was that no one was present on the occasion
 sirf is binah par ye kaise mana jaae ki jurm ke hakdaar aarushi ke maa-baap hi hai?faisla aa chukaa he
 But all these doubts and questions are still alive
 or tab tak rahenge, jab tak inke saare jawaab nahin mil jate
 Because it was the first house fight between justice and intrigue
 faansee yaa umr kaid? suspence bas yahi tha
 As expected, the CBI sought the court's execution for the Talwar couple
 daleel thi ki ye reerest of rer cese he par daleel kamazor thi
 Therefore, the court ignored this and sentenced him to life imprisonment
 talwaar dampatti kii sajaa main riyaayat ke liye vachaav paksh ke vakil ne ye bhi kaha ki talwaar dampatti ne apni beti khoi he, lekin adaalat ne zyada riyaayat nahin barti or apana faisla suna diya
 Both have been sentenced to life imprisonment under Section 302
 dhara 201 ke tahat rajesh or noopur talwaar donon ko 5 saal kaid kii sajaa hui he or dhara 203 ke tahat rajesh talwaar ko ek saal kii sajaa di gai he
 After the punishment was announced, both of them were taken to Dasna jail in Ghaziabad with despair and sadness in the face
 beti or naukar hemraj kii hatya main sajaa paane ke baad talwaar dampatti ab ucch adaalat main apil kar sakate hai
 Finish or Begin? Is this case really ended forever with this one decision or a new battle has started from here? The battle to prove his innocence in the upper courts for the accused parents of Aarushi's murderer or to give justice to her daughter? Because now the Talwar family is preparing to challenge this decision in the High Court
 chehre par maayusi or udaasi ke saath noopur or rajesh talwaar gajiabad main dasna jail pahunche
 The first night in jail, doctors Rajesh and Nupur Talwar did not sleep, the whole night spent both turning sides and moist eyes
 talwaar danpati ke rishtedaar kehete hai ki vishesh sibiai adaalat ke faisle ke khilaaf wo hoicourt jaaenge
 Rajesh and Nupur Talwar's relatives also claim that there are many flaws in the case and it is expected that they will get relief from the High Court
 kaise gujri pehali raat or pehla dingaziabad kii dasna jail main ab se aarushi ke pita dow
 Rajesh Talwar will be known as prisoner number 9342 and Aarushi's mother Nupur Talwar will be known as prisoner number 9343
 dow
 Rajesh Talwar will be in ward number 11 in jail and Nupur Talwar will be in ward number 13
 somvaar ko doshi qaraar die jane ke baad talwaar dampatti ko dasna jail bhej diya gaya tha
 Although both had spent many nights in Isu jail earlier also
 magar is baar jail main pehali raat is danpati ke liye behad mushkil bhari rahi
 Did not sleep overnight and Nupur Talwar's health deteriorated as soon as morning
 mangalvaar kii subah 9 bajkar 30 minute par nupur talwaar kii tabiyat bigadane lagi
 Nupur Talwar complained of nervousness
 unka bladpressure badhkar 160 / 106 ho gaya tha
 The prison doctor came and treated Nupur Talwar
 jail sutron ke mutabik raat bhar nahin sone or tension kii vajah se noopur kaa bladpressure bad gaya tha
 However after a few hours Nupur Talwar's health started improving
 sutron kii maane to isse pehle rajesh talwaar or noopur talwaar ko jail main alag-alag cell main rakhaa gaya
 At 7 pm on Monday, he was given bread, lentils and vegetables for dinner, but he did not eat well
 raatbhar wo 3 baar roe
 Even on Tuesday morning he did not have breakfast properly
 jail main ab rajesh talwaar or noopur talwaar ko abhi kai raaten kaatani hai, lekin talwaar danpati par adaalat kii sajaa se zyada dabaav us jurm kaa hoga, jiske liye unhen doshi qaraar diya gaya he

 Turns out the full context of this clip is as follows: The DG Rangers was visiting the protest site & was told that these are v poor activists who couldn't afford to return to their homes outside ISB - that's why at the start a man also says "let us help them" - money is for thatpic
