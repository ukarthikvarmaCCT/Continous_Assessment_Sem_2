 soshal media par 5 tarah kii alag-alag research study kii gai jisamen is baat kii pushti kii gai he ki soshal media par apni photo share karne vaale logon main hin bhaavana aa rahi he
 First, 227 girls from the university were included in this survey
 survey main pataa chalaa ki ladkiyaan sabase zyada apni tulana apane doston se hi karti hai
 Apart from this, she also gets upset seeing edited pictures of famous celebrities on Facebook
 is survey main is baat kaa bhi pataa chalaa ki ladkiyaan kabhi bhi apni tulana apane parivaar ke sadasyon se nahin karti hai
 In such a situation, it is important for these people to understand that the pictures that are seen on Facebook are half the truth
 soshal media par aplod hui tasveeron se hamen kabhi is baat kaa pataa nahin chalata he kii hakeekat main us vyakti kii jindagi main kya chal rahaa he
 Keeping this in mind, another study was done, in this study it has been said that our personality also becomes similar to the kind of pages we follow on Facebook and Instagram
 aimi stailer dwaara kii gai is study main 160 undergraduate ladakiyon ke instagram kaa adhyan kiya gaya
 The results of the study revealed that girls who follow only the # fitspo page saw low self-compression
 vahiin agar ladakiyon ne sakaaratmak chijen padhi, to unke andar hin bhaavana punap hi nahin pai or wo aatmavishvaas se bhari raheen
 After this, the study that was talked about was less of a study and more of a test
 is study ke andar ladakiyon ko kaha gaya ki wo apni sabase sudanr tasviren nikaalkar uske bare main 10 line likhen
 Through this test, it was found that girls give more importance to their physical beauty and not to their inner beauty
 unako is baat kii zyada phikr hoti he ki wo kisi dikh rahi hai naa kii is baat kii ki wo kisi insaan hai
 In another study, it was claimed that despite many selfies taken continuously, girls are not able to instill confidence in themselves
 in tasveeron main unhen kahin na kahin khamiyaan najar hi aati rahati hai
 Not only this, she also compares her picture with her friends
 is study main undergraduate ladakiyon ko apni- apni selfi lekar instagram yaa fasebuk par share karne ke liye kaha gaya
 While doing so a condition was also laid
 shart yah thi ki ek group ko apni selfi ko edit karne kaa mauka mila vahiin duusare group ko aisa kuch karne kii manaahi thi
 In this study, it was found that girls saw only flaws in their pictures
 unke paas us tasviir ko sudhaarney kaa mauka tha, baavjood iske unka dhyaan sirf nakaaratmak chizon par hi laga rahaa
 Let us know for information, this kind of habit is seen not only in girls but also in boys in this research
 wo khud se zyada feet logon ko dekhakar khud ko kamatar aankane lagate hai
 Well, after looking at these studies, it was concluded that one should not put his mind in those things where there is a possibility of inferiority complex
 isaki jagah vyakti ko soshal media par paryaton, prakruti se jude pejon ko follow karnaa chahie, aisa karne se man ko shanti milti he or ham apni tulana dusron se karnaa chhod dete hai
 Let me tell you, we are not asking you to leave social media, but yes, you can use it better
 iskaa prayog aatmavishvaas badhaane ke liye karen na ki ghataane ke liye

 priy gajendra ji, i have known you ever since you played Yudhishthira in the Mahabharata
 tab mahabharat dekhne ke liye besabri se intazaar karata tha
 Your character impressed me a lot
 dharm or satya par aadhaarit aapke is kirdaar se yuvaaon ko kaaphi kuch seekhney ko bhi mila
 But after the end of Mahabharata, you did not appear in any major role in any film or serial
 ho saktaa he film ke prati meri ruchi kam hone ke vajah se main aapkaa koi acha kirdaar dekh na paaya ho
 Nowadays you know why you are in the headlines? After you become the chairman of FTII, another 'mahabharata' has started
 aapaki sanstha ke chaatr nahin chaahate ki aap chairman bane rahen
 a few days ago, students of your institution arrived to perform at jantar-mantar
 aap khud samaj sakate hai ki baat kitni bad gai he
 Why not just the students, your fellow artists are also with you
 kai bade kalakaar bhi aapako is pad se hat jaanane ke liye kah chuke hai
 Many times you have said that this Protest is inspired by politics and some politicians are behind this Protest
 main bhi maanata hum ki kuch rajaneta is andolan ke jariye apni dukaan chalaane chaahate hai
 At Jantar Mantar, when i was talking to the students of your institution, they said that they are not doing the Protest because you are associated with the BJP, their question is about your caliber
 chaatro kaa yah bhi kahana tha ki bijepi se hi jude log jaise anupam kher yaa paresh rawal chairman bane to vah khush honge
 You also have to believe that the Protest was started by the students only
 jab iskaa koi phayda nahin hua tab rajaneta is andolan main kud pade
 If you had obeyed the students, today the politicians would not have taken advantage of it
 main aapako bataa duun ki yah pehali baar nahin he jab koi rajaneta apatiai kaa chairman ban rahaa he, haa yah jarur pehali baar he ki kisi netaa ke chairman banane par uske khilaaf itnaa joardaar andolan ho rahaa he
 When Vinod Khanna became the chairman of FTII in 2001, he was still a BJP MP and had a BJP government at the Center
 sirf vinod khanna kyon, you aar ananthamurti, jo 2005 main apatiai ke adhyaksh bane the, vah bhi kahin na kahin raajnneeti se jude the
 He contested as an independent candidate against BJP and was supported by Janata Dal Secular
 chaliye ham maan hi lete hai ki aap is pad ke liye sahi umidavaar hai, lekin sawaal yah uthta he ki agar aap itane din tak apane chaatro ko samajha nahin paae to phir aage kya karenge ? aapako lagata nahin yah aapaki vifaltaa he
 i do not say that you are not capable of becoming the chairman of FTII
 main bhi maanata hum ki aapako ek mauka milanaa chahie, lekin yah mauka agar chaatro ke man ko mugdh nahin kar paaya to aapako mahanata kaa parichay dete hue is maukey ko apane mutthi se mukt kar dena chahie
 Anyway, you have played the role of Yudhishthira in the Mahabharata
 vah yudhisthir jo dharm or nyaay kaa rasta apanaataa tha
 He had left Hastinapur for his Kaurava brothers, so can't you leave the post of chairman of FTII for these students
 aapke paas ek mauka he phir yudhisthir banakar chaatro kaa man jeetne kaa
 i am confident that you will do the same
 jate-jate mahabharat kii ek pankti he jo aapako yaad kara detaa hoon "samay ke bahaav ke raste main na kisi dukh kii rukaawat he, na kisi sukh kii, lekin bhagya kii rekhaaen samay ko bhi ulajhaa detii hai
 "how you look at this line depends on you
 tippaniyan your susheel kumaar mahapatra i have known you ever since you played Yudhishthira in the Mahabharata
 tab mahabharat dekhne ke liye besabri se intazaar karata tha
 Your character impressed me a lot
 dharm or satya par aadhaarit aapke is kirdaar se yuvaaon ko kaaphi kuch seekhney ko bhi mila
 But after the end of Mahabharata, you did not appear in any major role in any film or serial
 ho saktaa he film ke prati meri ruchi kam hone ke vajah se main aapkaa koi acha kirdaar dekh na paaya ho
 Nowadays you know why you are in the headlines? After you become the chairman of FTII, another 'mahabharata' has started
 aapaki sanstha ke chaatr nahin chaahate ki aap chairman bane rahen
 a few days ago, students of your institution arrived to perform at jantar-mantar
 aap khud samaj sakate hai ki baat kitni bad gai he
 Why not just the students, your fellow artists are also with you
 kai bade kalakaar bhi aapako is pad se hat jaanane ke liye kah chuke hai
 Many times you have said that this Protest is inspired by politics and some politicians are behind this Protest
 main bhi maanata hum ki kuch rajaneta is andolan ke jariye apni dukaan chalaane chaahate hai
 At Jantar Mantar, when i was talking to the students of your institution, they said that they are not doing the Protest because you are associated with the BJP, their question is about your caliber
 chaatro kaa yah bhi kahana tha ki bijepi se hi jude log jaise anupam kher yaa paresh rawal chairman bane to vah khush honge
 You also have to believe that the Protest was started by the students only
 jab iskaa koi phayda nahin hua tab rajaneta is andolan main kud pade
 If you had obeyed the students, today the politicians would not have taken advantage of it
 main aapako bataa duun ki yah pehali baar nahin he jab koi rajaneta apatiai kaa chairman ban rahaa he, haa yah jarur pehali baar he ki kisi netaa ke chairman banane par uske khilaaf itnaa joardaar andolan ho rahaa he
 When Vinod Khanna became the chairman of FTII in 2001, he was still a BJP MP and had a BJP government at the Center
 sirf vinod khanna kyon, you aar ananthamurti, jo 2005 main apatiai ke adhyaksh bane the, vah bhi kahin na kahin raajnneeti se jude the
 He contested as an independent candidate against BJP and was supported by Janata Dal Secular
 chaliye ham maan hi lete hai ki aap is pad ke liye sahi umidavaar hai, lekin sawaal yah uthta he ki agar aap itane din tak apane chaatro ko samajha nahin paae to phir aage kya karenge ? aapako lagata nahin yah aapaki vifaltaa he
 i do not say that you are not capable of becoming the chairman of FTII
 main bhi maanata hum ki aapako ek mauka milanaa chahie, lekin yah mauka agar chaatro ke man ko mugdh nahin kar paaya to aapako mahanata kaa parichay dete hue is maukey ko apane mutthi se mukt kar dena chahie
 Anyway, you have played the role of Yudhishthira in the Mahabharata
 vah yudhisthir jo dharm or nyaay kaa rasta apanaataa tha
 He had left Hastinapur for his Kaurava brothers, so can't you leave the post of chairman of FTII for these students
 aapke paas ek mauka he phir yudhisthir banakar chaatro kaa man jeetne kaa
 i am confident that you will do the same
 jate-jate mahabharat kii ek pankti he jo aapako yaad kara detaa hoon "samay ke bahaav ke raste main na kisi dukh kii rukaawat he, na kisi sukh kii, lekin bhagya kii rekhaaen samay ko bhi ulajhaa detii hai

 "how you look at this line depends on you
 tippaniyan your susheel kumaar mahapatra Let me tell you that this is not the first time that a politician is becoming the chairman of FTII, yes it is definitely the first time that there is such a strong movement against a leader becoming a chairman
 san 2001 main jab vinod khanna apatiai ke adhyaksh bane the tab bhi vah bijepi ke saansad the or centre main bijepi kii sarkaar thi
 Only Vinod Khanna, UR Ananthamurthy, who became the chairman of FTII in 2005, were also associated with politics somewhere
 ve bijepi ke khilaaf nirdaleey ummidavaar ke rup main chunaav lade the or janata dal secular ne unako samarthan diya tha
 Let us assume that you are the right candidate for this post, but the question arises that if you are not able to explain to your students for so many days then what will you do next? You don't think it's your failure
 main yah nahin kahata ki aap apatiai ke chairman banane ke kaabil nahin hai
 i also believe that you should get a chance, but if this opportunity does not enchant the students' mind, then you should free this opportunity from your fist by presenting greatness
 vaise bhi aap mahabharat main yudhisthir kaa kirdaar nibhaa chuke hai
 Yudhishthira who followed the path of religion and justice
 usne to apane kaurav bhaaiyon ke liye hastinapur chhod diya tha to kya in chaatro ke liye aap apatiai ke chairman kaa pad chhod nahin sakate
 You have a chance to win the students' mind by becoming Yudhishthira again
 mujhe puraa bharosa he ki aap aisa hi karenge
 There is a line in the Mahabharata that reminds you, "there is no interruption of sorrow, no happiness, but the lines of fate also complicate time
" " is pankti ko aap kaise dekhte hai, yah aap par hi nirbhar karata he
 The comments aapkaa Sushil Kumar Mohapatra chaliye ham maan hi lete hai ki aap is pad ke liye sahi umidavaar hai, lekin sawaal yah uthta he ki agar aap itane din tak apane chaatro ko samajha nahin paae to phir aage kya karenge ? aapako lagata nahin yah aapaki vifaltaa he

 a photo posted by Aayush Sharma (@aaysharma) on Mar 30, 2016 at 5:49am PDT On Monday, the BJP intensified the attack against Union Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde's remarks on 'hindu terrorism'
 party ne scindia ko barkhaast karne or congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi evam pradhanmantri manmohan singh se bina shart maafee maangane ke liye kaha, lekin congress ne bhaajapa kii maang maanane se inkaar kar diya
 Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad said that Shinde's remarks were irresponsible and condemnable and the Congress was doing vote bank politics
 unhone kaha, "main isaki ghor ninda karata hum
 This is a disgusting statement of a homeless minister who does not know what he is going to say
 " unhone kaha ki 24 janvari ko bhaajapa puure desh main scindia ke bayaan ke khilaaf pradarshan karegi or sanyukt pragatisheel gathbandhan (samprag) sarkaar kaa putala phunkegi
 Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, Arun Jaitley, said, "prove what Shinde has said or withdraw his statement or apologize
 " Congress spokesperson Rashid Alvi said that the question of removing Shinde or apologizing does not arise
 congress pravaktaa ne kaha, "scindia ne saaf kar diya he ki unka matlab makka masjid, samjhauta express or maalegaanv visphot se tha
 People involved in this are in jails and they said that this fact has come in the newspapers
 " It is to be known that at the Congress' Chetna camp, Shinde on Sunday raised a storm by commenting on Hindu terrorism and saffron terrorism
 baad main grih mantri ne saaf kiya tha ki ve sirf yah bataanaa chaah rahe the ki yah sab media main aayaa he or unka ishaara 'bhagava aatankwaad' kii ore tha
 Prasad said that the word saffron is considered 'sacred' in Indian tradition and is associated with the spiritual heritage of the country
 unhone kaha ki yah rashtriya dhvaj ke teen rangon main se ek he or hamaari aazaadee ke sangharsh se bhi judaa hua he
 The comments yah sawaal uthaate hue ki pavitra shabd ko aatankwaad se jodne kaa matlab kya he, unhone kaha ki bhaajapa or aresas ne kabhi nahin kaha ki aatankwaad ke doshiyon ko sajaa nahin do
 He said that BJP will never tolerate linking saffron to terrorism
 prasad ne kaha ki sonia or manmohan bina shart maafee maangen or scindia ko barkhaast kiya jaae
 He said that the handlers of terrorism in Pakistan would be very happy with Shinde's statement
 unhone kaa ki indian mujahidin ke kaaryakarta aatankwaadi karnaamon main sanliptata ke kaaran giraftaar hue hai, lekin bhaajapa ne kabhi ise dharm se nahin joda
 He questioned, "have we ever said Muslim terrorism? Terrorism has no religion
 " The party asked Shinde to sack and apologize unconditionally to Congress President Sonia Gandhi and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, but the Congress refused to accept the bjp's demand
 bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) ke pravaktaa ravishankar prasad ne kaha ki scindia kii tippanee gairajavabdeh or nindaneey he or congress vot bank kii raajnneeti kar rahi he
 He said, "I strongly condemn it
" yah bina damakham vaale us grih mantri kaa ghrunit bayaan he jise yahi nahin pataa ki vah kya kehane ja rahaa he
 "he said that on January 24, the BJP would protest against Shinde's statement throughout the country and burn the effigy of the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government
 rajyasabha main pratipaksh ke netaa arun jetali ne kaha, "scindia ne jo kaha he use sabit karen yaa phir ve apana bayaan waapas len yaa maafee maangen
 " congress pravaktaa raashid alvi ne kaha ki scindia ko hataane yaa maafee maangane kaa sawaal hi paidaa nahin hota
 The Congress spokesperson said, "shinde has made it clear that he meant Mecca Masjid, Samjhauta Express and Malegaon blast
 isamen sanlipt log jelon main band hai or unhone kaha tha ki yah tathy akhabaaron main aa chukaa he
 " gyaat ho ki congress ke chetana shivi main scindia ne ravivaar ko hindu aatankwaad or bhagava aatankwaad ke sambandh main tippanee kar tufaan khadaa kar diya
 Later, the Home Minister made it clear that he was just stating that all this has come in the media and he was referring to 'saffron terrorism'
 prasad ne kaha ki bhagava shabd bhartiya parampara main 'pavitra' mana jaataa he or yah desh kii aadhyatmik viraasat se sambhddha he
 He said that it is one of the three colors of the national flag and is also associated with our freedom struggle
 tippaniyan Asked what it means to link the holy word to terrorism, he said that the BJP and the RSS never said that punishment should not be given to the perpetrators of terrorism
 unhone kaha ki bhagava ko aatankwaad se jodne ko bhaajapa kabhi bardaasht nahin karegi
 Prasad said that Sonia and Manmohan apologize unconditionally and Shinde should be sacked
 unhone kaha ki pakistan main aatankwaad ke aakaa scindia ke bayaan se behad khush honge
 He said that the Indian Mujahideen activists were arrested for their involvement in terrorist acts, but the BJP never linked it to religion
 unhone sawaal uthaaya, "kya kabhi hamane kaha he muslim aatankwaad? aatankwaad kaa koi dharm nahin hota
 " bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) ke pravaktaa ravishankar prasad ne kaha ki scindia kii tippanee gairajavabdeh or nindaneey he or congress vot bank kii raajnneeti kar rahi he

 ’ By the way, parents never like to leave their children alone
 lekin kai baar paristhiyaan aisi ho jaati hai ki unhen bachche ko ghar par akele chhodkar janaa padataa he
 However, the parents leave their children alone when they themselves are convinced that their child has become sensible and can handle themselves for some time
 lekin bachche chahen kitne bhi samajhadaar kyon naa hon, lekimrin wo galtiyaan kar dete hai
 In such a situation, leaving them alone can prove to be dangerous
 lekin pareshaan hone kii jarurat nahin he
 You can reduce your anxiety to some extent just by taking care of some important things
 1
 Do leave the mobile near the child so that he keeps informing you from time to time and you also keep checking for him from time to time
 2
 Give the child some required emergency number so that he can call someone for help in case of any untoward incident
 3
 Do not lock the child in any corner or room of the house
 varanaa koi anhoni hone par wo baahar hi nahin nikal paaegaa
 4
 bachche ko apane saamne darwaja band karnaa or kholana sikhaaen
 Also tell him that instead of placing the top latch, he should put the bottom latch
 5
 Children should keep the food and drink on the dining table so that they do not go to the kitchen when they are hungry

 In the exit poll that came before the Lok Sabha election results, the Congress (congress) has been predicted not to get the seats as expected, although experts believe that if the party crosses the 100 mark then it will There may be a slightly comfortable situation for Speaker Rahul Gandhi
 vaise, pichley loksabhaa chunaav (lok Sabha Election 2019) main arsh se farsh par pahunchane ke baad is baar siton kaa shatak lagaana congress (congress) ke liye nishchit taur par chunauteepurn lakshya he
 On the other hand, the leadership of Rahul Gandhi, who took charge of the party one and a half years ago, is also tested
 haalanki party kaa maananaa he ki congress rahul gandhi (rahul Gandhi) ke netritv main kaaphi acha pradarshan karegi
 The Congress was reduced to 44 seats in the 2014 general election
 thimeh party kaa ab tak kaa sabase kharaab pradarshan tha
 The pre-election and post-poll surveys are talking about an increase in Congress seats, although there is no forecast of the party reaching power easily
 jaankaron kii maane to congress ke liye sahaj sthiti yah hogi ki vah 100 ke aankade tak pahunche, lekin agar aisa nahin hota he to phir rahul gandhi ke netritv par bhi kuch had tak sawaal khadey hone lagenge
 CSDS Director Sanjay Kumar says that this election is important for the future of both Congress and Rahul Gandhi
 meraa maananaa he ki agar congress 100 siton ke kareeb pahunchati he to uske liye santoshjanak sthiti hogi
 He said that this election is also important for the political future of Rahul Gandhi
 unke raajnneetik bhavishya ke maddenjar do baaten jaruri he ki vah amethi se khud jeeten or congress kareeb 100 siten jite
 The Congress has faced many defeats in the last five years, but its victory in the assembly elections of three states - Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan in november-december last year, served to strengthen the party's hopes for the Lok Sabha elections
 
 yah baat alag he ki party hawa ke us rukh ko barkaraar nahin pai or pulavama ke baad ke raajnneetik halaat ne uske liye mushkil chunautiyaan paidaa kar deen
 By the way, party leaders say that the Congress (congress) will do well in this election
 saalon tak congress ke kai utaar-chadhaav ke gavaah rahe party ke varisht netaa mohan prakaash ne kaha ki haar-jeet se itar congress ek vichaardhaara he jo is desh main kabhi khatm nahin ho sakati he
 Congress has always fought for the Idea of india and will continue to fight even further
 unhone kaha ki rahul gandhi ke netritv main kai rajyon main hamen jeet mili or is loksabhaa chunaav (lok Sabha Election 2019) main bhi ham bahut acha pradarshan karenge
 Congress leaders also say that there has been a lot of improvement in the last five years under the leadership of Rahul Gandhi
 party ke mukhya pravaktaa randeep surajevaala ne kaha ki rahul ji ne apane netritv ko jis prakaar se pichley paanch vashon main nikharaa he, jis prakaar se janata kii pidaa ko uthaaya he, jis prakaar se logon kii aawaaj buland kii he, wo apane aap main ek anuthi mehnat, lagan or prayaas kaa parinaam he
 Today his opponents also believe that he has the ability to work hard and diligently

 Addressing the program, Gadkari said, 'A saint said that you make your socio-economic life yourself
 tab se maine sarkaar par or bhagwaan par bharosa rakhana band kar diya
 Neither do i ask for help from the government, nor do i go

 samay-samay par ham sabko tanaav kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 The way to avoid stress is to release whatever you are doing and take a deep breath for a minute
 aap kandhe, haath or ungaliyon ko bhi dhilaa chhod sakate hai or phir kas sakate hai
 a little practice is necessary to maintain alertness
 jo bhi kar rahe hon achaanak ruk jaaen, qamar or haathon main aa rahe tanaav ko jhatak den or aasapaas ke maahaul ke prati sachet ho jaaen
 Then ask yourself how it looks
 kai baar aapane mahasoos kiya hoga ki bhukh-pyaas yaa thakaavat mahasoos karne par aapkaa sharir pratikriya darshata he
 My second daughter Gagandeep and i do not realize hunger and thirst
 in jaruraton ko puraa karne ke baad hi pataa chalata he ki yahi hamaare tanaav va gusse kii vajah thi
 As age increases, we are unable to pay attention to our needs
 iskaa hal yahi he ki vartmaan main jien, apane aap se puuchhen ki aapke saath aisa kyon hota rahaa he? puure din main kam se kam 30-40 minute kaa samay apane liye nikaalen
 At this time, read anything good, meditate or analyze
 mausam, badhati manhagaai, bos yaa netaa aadi par hamaara vash nahin chal saktaa he
 Yes, you can write these things in a diary or share them with a trusted friend
 main bhi har roj diary likhata hum, vah mere jivan kii tarah he jisamen maine har tarah ke mudde par khulkar likhaa tha
 When it appeared, its four versions went out of hand
 angreji main likhi pustak kaa anuwaad hindi va punjabi main bhi chapa
 My friend Mahesh was always surrounded by negative thoughts and blamed himself for the situation
 nakaaratmak logon kaa saath or nakaaratmak soch ne uske chaaro ore udaasi kaa aisa jaal bun diya tha ki use kahin bhi safalataa nahin milti thi
 He asked me why i am so happy? i told him that the more time he spends in negative thinking, the more time i spend in positive thinking
 maine use bataaya ki sakaaratmak soch ke kya-kya phaayde ho sakate hai
 Death, divorce and loss of job in the family are facts of life, which you cannot change, but you can find a way to get out of these situations
 kuch log gambhirtha kaa labaadaa odhakar apane jivan ko hi kshtmay bana lete hai
 Do not think about anything seriously and keep up your courage
 19 janvari, 1966 ko meri shaadi hui, baraat ke zyaadaatar log dehati ilaake se the
 They came with the greed to see Chandigarh that they would leave the groom and go to see Chandigarh
 kuch logon ko yah baat badi nagavar gujri, lekin maine ise gambhirtha se nahin liya or baat hansi main uda di
 On such bad and sad occasions your laughter comes in handy
 tanaav ke samay aisi mjedaar baton par dhyaan laga len jo aapke jivan kaa hissaa hon
 Our whole existence is so boring and full of workload that we only think what is going wrong with us? In such a situation, we forget to praise even the smallest things
 bure bos yaa sahakarmiyon ke bich hamaari sakaaraatmakataa kahin kho si jaati he
 In such a situation, first finish your work and then pay attention to the things that matter to you in life

 Nandan's editor Jayanti Ranganathan said that as an editor, she goes to schools and went there and found out that today's children prefer to read content related to horror
 pehle meri soch thi ki kya ham bacchon ko daraavnee samragi de sakate hai
 But children today do not want to read the story of the king-queen or the lion-goat
 lekhika ne kaha ki hamen bhi yah dhyaan rakhana hoga ki aaj ke daur ke bachche kya padhanaa chaahate hai
 Why the grandmother and grandmother do not tell the story today, the child litterateur told the children sitting in the audience that they want to read comics series like Superman, Ironman nowadays

 bhale hi usase bachche bigaden yaa kuch or galat dharanaen apane bheetar paalen, hua ye he ki pansad ke naam par bahut kuch thopa bhi ja rahaa he
 But literature says that whatever is not preferred but has better material, it should be introduced, with time it will also be liked

 He said that the child turns to the way the parents are interested in the children
 aap kitaab denge to wo padhenge, agar tablet yaa tivi ke saamne bitha denge to vah usee ko dekhenge
 Jayanti said that inculcating the habit of reading in children depends on their families

 com Municipal corporation elections are to be held in Delhi on 22 April
 aise main congress har vah hatkandaa apana rahi he jisase party kii saakh phir se kaayam ho sake
 The party has won the Punjab elections led by Captain Amarinder Singh
 punjab chunaav main shandaar pradarshan kaa phayda congress dilli nagar nigam chunaav main bhi uthaanaa chaahati he
 Therefore, the party is preparing to bring Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh, who was the hero of Punjab's victory, for campaigning in the Municipal Corporation of Delhi elections
 congress sutron ke mutabik captain amarinder april ke maheene main 6 road sho or jansabhaon ko sambodhit karenge or sikh tathaa punjabi samaaj ko party se jodne kaa kaam karenge
 The comments dilli congress pravaktaa ne bataaya ki dilli congress kii team punjab chunaav prachaar main kejariwal kii pole kholane ke liye gai thi, lihaaja punjab unit bhi dilli main prachaar karne ke liye aegi
 Captain Singh will come here to campaign in many seats
 aapako bataa den ki dilli main acchhee khaasi aabaadi punjabi or sikh samaaj ke logon kii he
 Sikh and Punjabi voters are in large numbers in about a dozen assembly seats, including Tilak Nagar, Hari Nagar, Rajouri Garden, Moti Nagar, New Delhi's Patel Nagar, Karol Bagh, Rajinder Nagar in West Delhi

 apane khilaadiyon se hameshaa safalataa kii maang karne vaale bhartiya darshakon ko khush rakhana aasaan nahin he
 The bets are hardly equal if the Indian team saves the World Cup title, but the Indian team's victory against Pakistan in their first match of the World Cup is almost all set
 bharat or pakistan ravivaar ko edilade ovel main ek-duusare ke khilaaf apane-apane vishwa cap abhiyaan kii shuruyaat karenge
 On the eve of his first match, Indian team captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni assured his fans that the players of his team have the ability to withstand the pressure of this match
 dhoni ne kaha ki is match ko lekar bhartiya team ke khilaadiyon main bechaini nahin he, balki ve kaaphi sanyat hai or unke paas bade maichon kaa dabaav jhelane kaa anubhav he
 Dhoni argues that playing in the highly pressurized and packed stadium of the Indian Premier League (IPL) has prepared his team well for the World Cup
 lekin dhoni shaayad yah bhul gaye ki vishwa cap jaise toornament main dabaav sahane kii kshamta nahin, balki vipakshi team par dabaav banane kii kshamta safalataa dilaati he
 Hosts New Zealand and Australia have shown how the opposition team is forced out of the match on the strength of batting
 ise sanyog hi kahenge ki donon hi mejabaanon newjiland or australia ko unki vipakshi tiimon ne toss jitkar pehle ballebaaji ke liye aamantrit kiya
 And both teams achieved the expected start by the end of the opening power play
 australian mahadweep main 23 varsh pehle hue vishwa cap ke dauraan bhartiya team pakistan ke khilaaf apane 216 ranon ke score kaa bachaav karne main safal rahi thi or pakistan ko 173 par samet diya tha
 But that period was when a score of over 220 was considered good
 dhoni pakistan ke khilaaf pehle gendbaaji chunanaa pasand kar sakate hai, taaki unki aprabhavi gendbaaji akraman taaji pich kaa laabh uthaa sake
 But in such a situation, the pitch of Adelaide Oval in the second innings can prove to be helpful for spin bowlers
 pichley saal november se australia main maujuud bhartiya team ke pradarshan ko vishwa cap kii taiyaari ke anukool nahin kaha ja saktaa, lekin vishwa cap main bharat ko shaayad isse acha kaarykram bhi nahin mil saktaa
 Some sports experts even say that the format of the World Cup has been kept so that India remains in the tournament for the maximum time
 or shaayad antarrashtriya cricket parishad (isisi) bhi nahin chahta ki bhartiya team nokout se pehle hi baahar ho
 For India, the first match against Pakistan is important in many ways, as India's entry into the knockout will be decided to a large extent on winning
 iske baad bharat ko khitaab bachaane ke liye maatr do match jeetne honge
 India's victory will depend to a large extent on these questions: - - test maichon main behad kharaab pradarshan karne ke baad kya bhartiya gendbaaji antarrashtriya ekadivasiy main khud ko patari par lautaa paaegi? - Will batting be able to make up for poor bowling in the absence of match-winning bowlers? - kya bhartiya kshetrarakshan apane puraane dinon kii chhavi se baahar nikal paaegaa? - Is the Indian team keen to step up Dhoni to the extent it was with Sachin Tendulkar last time? - or ant main yah ki kya captain dhoni pichhali baar kii hi tarah apni team ke liye usee tarah prerana strot ban paaenge? Amid heightened tensions with India, the Pakistani Air Force chief warned that his security forces would respond to any enemy attack in such a way that its future generations would remember it

 unhone kaha ki dushman ke kisi bhi akraman par hamaara jawaab is tarah kaa hoga ki unki aane vaali peediyaan ise yaad rakhengi
 After the Indian Army's crackdown on the Pakistan Army in Nowshera sector, Pakistan is in a panic
 buudhvaar subah siachin ke paas skardu main pakistani air force ke vimaan dikhaai diye hai
 Skardu is a border region of Pakistan
 pakistani vayusena adhyaksh sohail amen ne bhi buudhvaar ko skardu kaa daura kiya he
 According to Pakistani media, all the important airbases of Pakistan have been brought into operational mode
 skardu daure par aaye paak vaayu sena adhyaksh ko sabhi sabhi jaankariyaan muhaiyaa karai gai
 Amen has also spoken to several officers there
 sohail amen ne khud vahaan par miraj jet ko udaaya
 India rejected the claim, although the Indian Air Force denied the Pakistani media's claim
 pakistani airforce aise daawey sirf apane desh kii janata ko khush karne ke liye kah rahaa he
 Let me tell you that on Tuesday, Indian soldiers gave information that the army has demolished them while taking major action on Pakistani posts along the border in Nowshera sector
 sabase khaas baat ye he ki bhartiya sena ne baqayada karrwai kaa ek video jari kiya he
 That is, for the first time India has presented proof of its action against Pakistan
 sena kii is karrwai ko pakista ke khilaaf ek or sargical strike mana ja rahaa he
 While giving a befitting reply to the terrorist plans of Pakistan, the Indian Army destroyed 10 Pakistani posts in Nowshera on 9 May, while on 20-21 May carried out operations against Pakistan in the Naugam sector
 is dauraan naushera sector main pakistani banksron ko nasht kiya gaya he
 Pakistani bunkers are seen in the video being destroyed
 pahadiyon ke bich bane in banksron par gole daag kar nasht kiya gaya, jinase dhuna uthta hua najar aa rahaa he
 The Indian Army said that there was continuous infiltration from Pakistan's side
 saath hi seemaa paar se firing kii ja rahi thi
 The army said that these bunkers built across the border provided cover to the intruders
 aise main in banksron ko apni seemaa kii suraksha ke liye nasht karnaa jaruri tha
 Let us know that in 2016, India broke into Pakistan's border and gave it a befitting reply
 sargical strike ke jariye bharat ne pakistan ko karaara jawaab diya tha
 After the surgical strike, opposition parties in India demanded evidence from the Modi government and the army
 aise main is baar sena ne puri taiyaari ke saath pakistan ke khilaaf na sirf ection liya balki saboot ke taur par ek video bhi jari kiya

 But more surprising than this is that the Thakurs' colony, which is four counted houses, is located at a distance of eight to ten steps, cleanliness and concrete pits are seen
 jabaki musaharon kii basti main kareeb teen sau ghar hai
 On the other side is the Mian settlement
 vahaan bhi halaat thakuron kii basti jaise na sahi lekin itane kharaab bhi nahin hai
 leaves and plank leaves is also to work in brick kilns
 saal main kareeb chah se aath maheene yah log baahar hi rahete hai
 Right now we were talking to some women that Sohan, who is about sixty-sixty five years old, comes back
 madam kam se kam line kii sifarish laga dijie
 See, there are four houses of Thakurs beside the side, yet there is a line
 miyaanon kii basti main bhi line he
 Even in the Patel's colony
 bas hamaari hi basti main aaj tak line nahin pahunchi
 Looking around, there was really no wire
 kya yahaan kabhi line nahin rahi, poochne par pattal bana rahi chhinguria bolti he
 never
 pradhan se kaho to kehete hai kya karoge line kaa? agar kaho ki pradhan ji, bachche raat main hi padhane baithte hai, to kehete hai? padhakar kya colector banenge
 Interestingly, this village was also declared Ambedkar Village in 2002
 baavjood iske daliton ke ghar roshan nahin ho sake
 There are pillars all around Patel, Thakur, Mian, Shepherd's colony
 lekin yah basti chhuti he
 Asked again, why don't you go to the government office? The answer was expected
 sahab hamaare liye to pradhan hi sarkaar hai
 The difference between this settlement and the surrounding neighborhood can be easily seen without asking anyone anything
 is badahaali kii kahani ke bich hi achaanak poocha kise vot denge
 So the question was found instead of the answer
 aap bataaiye kise den? abhi camel kii gaadi ai thi
 To go in their procession
 ham ek-do log chale gaye the
 But what is the use, vote for anyone
 musaharon kii koun sunegaa? yah poochne par ki kya kabhi pradhan is basti main aate hai
 Got an answer, no! How will they come to our door? we go
 par kuch sunate hi nahin pradhan ji
 Now the question that he asked, perhaps he had asked only for his comfort, because by now his condition was known as to what would be the answer? You invite people around to marry
 haa, juthe pattal binane ke liye jate hai
 These people must have bought the plates from you
 jawaab mila haa
 So do you eat food in your touched plate? puraa gaanv hi nahin puraa banaras khaataa he
 Just don't touch us
 
 
 itnaa kehete-kehete ek 18-19 saal ke ladke ke munh se gaali foot padi
 Anger and anger were palpable in his voice
 paas baithi tetara devi ne or gusse main kaha hamaara chuaa chamaar bhi nahin khate
 Because we are not Dalits but Mahadalits
 haalanki skool se padhakar aate bacchon ko dekhakar thodi tasalli jarur hui
 The colony of Thakurs was close by
 ginati ke chaar ghar
 Neat township basti ke nami-giraami daroga singh se chunavi charchaa kii to tapaak se bole bas modi hi aaenge
 In many cases, i asked him why the settlement of Mushars is so dirty? Don't even have a line? Got an answer, tell me, Madam inhen to andhera hi pasand he
 Never try anything
 hamane to kabhi bhi is basti main line nahin dekhi
 His son Rahul Singh, standing together, shook his father's voice and said, "dirt and they have the support of the body
" pradhan ke ghar jaakar unase musaharon kii basti ke bare main poocha to yahaan bhi jawaab mila ki yah log andhera hi pasand karte hai
 When asked whether you have ever talked about the line in the department, the answer was not received, never
 kyon? madam aadhe saal to bhatthon main rahete hai, ya log
 After all what will the line do? The same situation is with all the Mushar settlements of Banaras
 yah to musahar hai jinhen mahadalit mana jaataa he
 But in most villages, the condition of Dalit settlements is almost similar
 agade or pichhadon kii bastiyon kaa yah antar gaanvon main saaf dikhaai detaa he
 This is the situation not only in Banaras but in different districts of Uttar Pradesh
 jaisaa ki lagaataar media main aa raheen khabaron se lag rahaa he ki narendra modi bharat ke agle pradhanmantri ban sakate hai, to aisi sthiti main vikaas bakhaan karne vaale modi ke liye in mahadaliton ko vikaas kii mukhyadhara se jodna ek chunauti hoga
 It has to be seen whether the flashlight of Modi's development falls on these Mahadalits or it will only illuminate the strong sections of society

 unhone kaha, 've pidipi kii raajnneeti ko lekar sahaj nahin the

 'gauratlab he ki is baithak ke duusare din yani 25 disambar ko ram madhav ne isse judi khabaron kaa khandan karne kii koshish kii

 jabaki bijepi sutron kaa kahana he, 'ensi kii shuruaati pratikriya kaaphi saakaratmak thi
 But after the conversation we felt that Omar lacked confidence
 unhone ek mauka ganvaa diya
 'it is worth noting that in the 87-seat Jammu and Kashmir assembly elections, BJP got 24 seats and the National Conference got 15 seats

 In the trailer, it does not mention Indira Gandhi or Sanjay Gandhi or anyone else

 According to Nihalani, 'I did not hear anyone's name in the trailer, if they mentioned in the film, then we will look into the matter
 philhal main is baat se khush hum ki kisi ne apatkaal par film banaai he
 This is a black spot in our political history

 But now another big chance is coming in his life
 moshe ab das saal kaa ho gaya he or bhartiya pradhanmantri narendra modi ne use milane ke liye bulaayaa he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi is visiting Israel from July 4, where Moshe will meet him in Jerusalem
 moshe ke parijanon ne kaha- hamaare dukh main saajheedaar hai bhartiyamoshe ke dada-daadi or uski dekhbhaal karne vaali bhartiya naini (aayaa) ke liye yah bhavuk kar dene vaala pal he
 Moshe's family said that it was felt by the invitation of the Indian Prime Minister that Indians are also partners in our misery and they have not forgotten us
 pradhanmantri narendra modi moshe kii bhartiya naini sandra sampuls se bhi milenge
 Sandra played a key role in saving Moshe during the terrorist attack at Nariman House
 moshe or unke dada-daadi shimon or yehudeet rocenberg ko lekar sandra nariman house se bhaag nikaleen
 Indian High Commissioner made the call
 Nayotashimon Rosberg told PTI that when we received a call from the Indian High Commissioner, i could not believe my ears that Prime Minister Narendra Modi wanted to meet us
 meri pehali pratikriya thi ki bhartiya hamen bhuule nahin hai or hamaare dukh main saajheedaar hai
 Rosenberg further said that it is not possible to tell the sensation received by the call of the Indian Prime Minister
 ham is maukey kii ore dekh rahe hai
 Moshe's bar to be held in Mumbai When asked by Mitzahmoshe's grandfather what he would say to him when he met the Indian Prime Minister, Rosenberg said that we want to host our grandson in Mumbai and call Prime Minister Narendra Modi for this

 Rosenberg said that we feel we have a home in Mumbai and there is a family there

 mumbai hamale ke dauraan nariman house main ghuse lashkar ke aatankiyon ne rivaka or gevrial sahit 6 logon ko maar diya tha
 In the 2008 Mumbai attack, 166 people were killed
 chabad house ke naam se mashhoor nariman house un paanch sthanon main se ek tha jahaan aatankiyon ne hamalaa kiya tha
 Moshe's special attachment to Indian Aya Sandra is now 10 years old and goes to Yeshiva, a religious school
 apni aayaa sandra ke saath moshe kaa bahut lagaav he, jo yerusalem main kaam karti hai or saptaah ke aakhir main moshe ke parivaar se milane jaati hai

 the best memories! purv 'tri' chairman pradeep baijal ne 2ji ghotaalaa maamle main us vakt ke pradhanmantri manmohan singh par aarope lagaaya he
 He said that the Prime Minister had spoken of taking 'losses' if he did not cooperate
 apni kitaab main baijal ne likhaa he ki upie-2 nekhud par lage aaroponko kisi or ke sir madhne ke liye unki chhavi kharaab kar di
 Significantly, the role of Baijal in this case was also investigated by the authorities for a long time
 angreji akhbaar 'times of india' ne yah khabar di he
 According to Baijal, 'the situation of bureaucrats like me was such that' do some trouble 'and' don't do trouble '
 maine upie-2 main shaami kai logon ko chetaya tha ki mere or duusare adhikariyon ke khilaaf baithai gai jaanch antat: pradhanmantri tak ja sakati he kyonki unhone hi saare mantriyon or mantralayon ke faislon ko manjuuri di thi
 He had given the green signal to the works of Dayanidhi Maran, a Raja and the Minister of Coal and he is equally guilty of the loss which the CAG has reported to the treasury
 'baijal ne ye daawey apni kitaab 'da complit story of indian riforms: 2ji, power and privet enterprise- a practicenurs diary' main kiye hai
 In a chapter titled 'how problems started', Baijal has claimed, 'I had expressed my apprehension to PM Manmohan Singh in 2004 when Dayanidhi Maran was appointed as Telecom Minister
 kyonki yah hiton ke takaraav kaa maamla tha
 Maran was a broadcaster and TRAI was formed in 2004 as a broadcast regular
 'lekin baijal ke mutabik manmohan singh ne yah kehete hue unki chintaaon kaa khaarij kar diya ki yahhiton ke takaraav kaa maamlanhin he kyonki tri ek swatantra regulator or soochna-prasaaran or telecom alag-alag mantralay hai
 Baijal has even called Manmohan Singh the 'prime Minister, Telecom' of that time
 unke mutabik, manmohan hi telecom se jude saare faisle lete the
 According to Baijal, 'he said that if i do not listen to his instructions, then i will have to suffer heavy losses
 unki yab baat sahi sabit hui kyonki tab se mujhe bahut kuch jhelana padaa he

 Even before Narendra Modi arrived in India on the lines of Kyoto with the promise of saving Japan and helping Japan in cleaning the Ganges, the Supreme Court brought to light the functioning of his government on Ganga cleaning
 adaalat ne yahaan tak kah daalaa ki ganga kii safai main 200 saal lag jaaenge, or kya aane vaali peediyaan ganga ko kabhi uski puraani garima ke saath dekh paaengi
 During the hearing of the Ganga cleaning in the Supreme Court, Justice TS Thakur said that we do not know if we will ever see Ganga in real terms, but the government should try to bring Ganga back to its glorious form, which is next Generations to see
 centre sarkaar ke halafname ko bilkul sarkari bataate hue supreme court ne kaha ki aapane daftari dhang se byore de daale hai, or hamen cametiyon ke byore se matlab nahin he, lekin ham jaananaa chaahate hai ki ganga safai kii jo prakriya banegi, use aam aadmi kaise samajhe
 It would be better for the government to put our phased plan in front of the court through powerpoint presentation, and also decide the scale from which the progress of cleanliness can be assessed
 supreme court ne kaha ki sarkaar ganga safai kii charanbaddh yojana kaa khaakaa taiyaar kare or teen hafton main adaalat ke saamne pesh kare
 Earlier, in the hearing, Solicitor General Ranjit Kumar, while referring to the government affidavit, had told the court that the government was committed to cleaning the Ganges and had also cited various schemes
 haalanki sarkaar ne yah bhi kaha ki iaiti kii report is saal disambar main aane kii ummid he or iske baad hi kaam shuru ho paaegaa
 The Ganga cleanup case, which is about 2,500 km long and passes through five states, is going on in the Supreme Court since 1985
 court ne sarkaar ko kaha he ki vah charanbaddh tareeke se safai kii yojana taiyaar kare or iske liye samaysima bhi tay kare
 Two weeks ago, the Supreme Court has reminded the government that it has given Ganga an important place in its election manifesto
