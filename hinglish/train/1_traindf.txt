 High tariffs on steel and aluminum have drawn strong condemnation from rivals such as the US ally, Canada, the European Union and Mexico, as well as rivals China

 The EU has already indicated that it is going to take such a step on US steel import tariffs

 On the other hand, the EU will also take tit-for-tat action under retaliation, which will reduce the flow of world trade overall

" '' haalanki yah koi pehla mauka nahin he jab haal-philhal america ne vyapaar ke mudde par bharat ko nishaanaa banane kii koshish kii he
 Urging India to raise the issue on international forums, Dhar says, "in 2014, the US International Trade Commission began an investigation into India's trade and investment policy to find out how it would hurt American interests
" Has been lekin bharat ko is tarah kii harkaton se dabana nahin chahie
 In future, the US may also raise some intellectual property rights issues
 bharat ko taaja kadam ke khilaaf turant dablutio janaa chahie kyonki isse vishwa vyapaar ko gambhir chot pahonchegi

 com / 1oqqglzw2f Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president Amit Shah rejected the claims of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) allies not being happy, saying all its constituents were united
 endie main kisi bhi tarah kaa koi matbhed yaa daraar nahin he
 He referred to the decision by the NDA to field JDU MP Harivansh Narayan Singh for the post of Deputy Chairman of Rajya Sabha in favor of his claim
 shah ne modi sarkaar ke khilaafvipakshi ekajutatapar chutki lee
 Emphasizing the solidarity of the bjp-led NDA, he said that opposition solidarity is being spoken against the Modi government, but no one has seen the motion of no confidence against the Modi government and what happened in the Rajya Sabha Deputy Speaker election
 shah ne kaha ki avishvaas prastaav laane kii koi thos vajah nahin thi
 On the question of bringing the mps of the opposition parties in his favor, he said that some people even rise above the party and vote
 nitish kumaar ke saath virodh or phir dosti karne ke sawaal par unhone kaha ki nitish ne tay kiya ki unako bhrashtachar ke saath nahin rahanaa he or wo hamaare saath aa gaye
 When told that the BJP is expanding rapidly in every state, the allies are apprehensive about its existence
 is par amit shah ne kaha, ham har booth par bhaajapa ko majboot karnaa chaahate hai, taaki ham apane sahyogiyon ko chunaav main jita saken
 If the BJP is strong, it will help the allied parties to win the election
 jab bhaajapa adhyaksh se poocha gaya ki agarendie main matbhedanheen hai, to naresh gujral or sanjay raut kyon kah rahe hai ki bhaajapa ko chunaav jeetne ke liye vaajapeyi jaise vyavhaar karne kii jarurat he? is par shah ne kaha, 'main vishwaas ke saath kahana chahta hum ki endie ke saare ghatak dal bhaajapa ke saath hai
 Those who spread rumors of differences in NDA are not going to get anything
 rajyasabha or loksabhaa main endie ke ghatak dalon ne jaakar bijepi ke paksh main vot dekar yah sabit bhi kiya he ki endie main koi matbhed nahin he
 We kept the allies together despite winning a majority
 'jab amit shah se poocha gaya ki piem modi ne vipaksh se 2024 main phir se avishvaas prastaav laane ko kaha he
 Does this mean that the Modi government will be formed again? On this, Amit Shah said that the people of the country will again give a majority to Modi in 2019
 ham janata ke paas pichley paanch saal ke kaamkaaj kaa hisaab or agle paanch saal kaa khaakaa lekar jaaenge
 The public's eyes and emotions all tell that she is going to win Modi again
 amit shah ne kaha ki bijepi 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main 2014 se bhi zyada bada bahumat hasil karegi
 The people of the country have made up their mind to make Modi the Prime Minister again
 hamen ise lekar koi andeh nahin he
 Shah, in response to a question asked by Mehul Choksi and Nirav Modi's escape from the country, accused of cheating banks, said that the Modi government's continued action against them will ensure that there will be fewer thieves in the country
 yashraj films kii aane vaali film 'detective byomakesh bakshi' kii heroin swastika mukherjee ne aatmahatya kii koshish kii he

 doctoron ko iske liye surgery tak kerani padi thi
 It is reported that Swastika was upset due to boyfriend's feud with the filmmaker
 haalanki parivaaravaalon ne in khabaron ko khaarij kiya he
 Swastika's sister Ajopa Mukherjee has said that Swastika suffered injuries during a party
 doctoron ke bayaan par police ne ise aatmahatya kaa cese maanane se inkaar kar diya he
 It is worth noting that this actress, who is often in controversy due to her statements and mms, can go to jail for a year if it was proved that she had attempted suicide

 bijepi ke navaniyukt adhyaksh ke taur par aapaki sabase badi chunauti kya he?main ise kaam ke taur par dekhtaa hum
 We have overcome the biggest challenge by winning a clear majority in the Lok Sabha elections
 ab hamaare saamne paanch kaam hai
 The main task is to establish BJP as a strong link between the government and the public
 iske baad hamen un rajyon main sanghathan ko majboot karte hue vot batorne vaale ek thos tantra ko viksit karnaa hoga jahaan hamaare vot to bade hai lekin inhen ham paryaapt siton main tabdeel nahin kar paae, yaa phir vahaan jahaan siten or badhaane kii gunjaaish ho, jaise pashchim bengal, assam, tamilnadu, orissa, telugana or andhra pradesh
 Then we have to register a spectacular victory like Lok Sabha in the upcoming elections of other states including Maharashtra
 hamen apni maujuuda lokapriyata kaa laabh uthaate hue party kii sadsyta ko badhanaa he
 And finally, we also have to start a training program for party workers to bring organizational strength
 jab narendrabhai gujarat ke mukhyamantri the, tab bhi ve is par bahut bal dete the kyonki ve hameshaa maanate the ki sarkaar ke kaaryakramon ko janata tak pahunchane main party sanghathan kii nirnaayak bhoomika hoti he
 Which proposed changes are in your mind for the party organization? We want to reach in areas where we do not have a presence and for this we will adopt methods like e-registration
 logon ko party ke kareeb laane main praudyogiki kaa zyada se zyada istemaal karne kii hamen jarurat he
 We are bringing a new software which will inform the party president and other office-bearers sitting in Delhi in advance about the smallest upcoming elections in the country
 hamen jamini str par vichaardhaaratmak prashikshan par bhi zyada bal dena hoga
 It also needs to be assured that our publications across the country remain consistent so that a strong and uniform message from the party can reach across the country
 maujuuda raajnneetik ghatnakram se jin yuvaaon kaa mohabhang ho chukaa he, ham unhen bhi apane saath laane ke liye nae tareeke khojane kii kaamana karte hai
 Now that the command of the Center is in the hands of the BJP, will power-grabbing not become an everyday thing? When a party comes to power, it is not an unusual thing, but there is a whole army of cadres in the BJP and the Sangh who are their own He remains unaffected by ideological nurturing
 aap narendra modi kaa daayan haath hai
 Now that AAP is in charge of the party, then there should not be a repeat of the problems of the Vajpayee government between the party and the government, what will be its scope? i am the right hand of Narendrabhai, this is the perception created by the media
 hamaare bich koi vishisht rishta nahin he
 They trust every worker who works hard and who has the talent and ability to produce results
 party kaa kaam sarkaar or janata ke bich pul kibhumika nibhaana he
 We did not have an absolute majority at the time of the Vajpayee government
 is baar aisa nahin he
 You are just 49 years old
 itani badi jimmedaari se kahin aap ghabaraate to nahin hai?meri jimmedaari bijepi ke vijay juluus ko aage le janaa he
 This work is not one man, it is teamwork
 yahaan tak ki uttar pradesh ke pradarshan kaa bhi jo shrey mujhe akelaa diya ja rahaa he, vah timwork tha
 The pressure of the Sangh on ideological issues was an important issue during Vajpayee's era
 aap usase kaise nibatenge?media kii yah dharna ki aresas rosemara ke kaam main dakhal detaa he, galat he
 But will Sangh leader Ram Madhav join the BJP and tighten the Sangh's hold on the party? It is an old tradition for a Sangh worker to join the BJP
 main bhi sangh kaa hi kaaryakarta hum
 What is your biggest earning for being associated with Modi for so long? Narendrabhai has taught me that if you keep trying in adverse conditions, you will definitely reach your destination
 unhone bahudaleey loktantric vyavastha main janata ke bharose ko behaal kiya he or gujarat main yah sabit kiya he ki isi maujuuda tantra ke bheetar sushasan sambhav he
 The principles of governance that they have devised, their spectacular results will now be seen at the national level also
 modi ke bagaiyr amit shah kya hai?ek amit shah se modi ko katai koi fark nahin padataa
 What is the power behind you? CBI sent you to jail in connection with Sohrabuddin Sheikh fake encounter
 aap ab bhi jamaanat par hai?main anaavashyak aalochanaon se niraash nahin hota hum
 The cases of fake encounters against me are part of political propaganda
 main apana kaam puure tan-man se karata hum or party main sabko saath lekar chalata hum
 You are seen as a staunch Hindutvaist
 aapaki niyukti ko musalmaan kaise dekhen?main apane pradhanmantri ke die naare “sabakaa saath, sabakaa vikaas” ke saath bandhaa hum
 My anti-muslim image has been created by the media
 main sirf kisi ek tabake ke tushtikaran ke virodh main hum
 This is the ideology of our party
 lekin aapane uttar pradesh main ek bhi musalmaan ko bijepi kii ore se loksabhaa chunaav main tikat nahin diya?yah party kaa faisla tha
 We do not see Hindus or Muslims in ticket distribution
 hamaari kasuti yah hoti he ki koun jeet saktaa he
 But during the party's election campaign did you make anti-muslim statements in Uttar Pradesh? This is wrong
 un bayanon ke madhyam se maine raajnneetik virodhiyon ke khilaaf uttar pradesh sarkaar kii sajishon or kushasan ko saamne laane kii koshish kii thi
 Not even once did i use the word 'muslim'
 modi sarkaar ne apane pehle bajet main madrason ke aadhunikeekaran ke liye 100 karod rupye kaa aavanton kiya he
 Isn't this appeasement? Modernization of madrasas is part of our manifesto
 yah hamaara uddeshy he ki dharmik shiksha ke alaava madrason main aadhunik shiksha bhi di ja sake
 It would be wrong to call it appeasement
 party ke varisht netaaon kaa bharosa aap kaise jeetenge?unka bharosa mujh par pehle se hi he
 i have become president only with his trust and support
 aapako is baat kaa shrey jaataa he ki aapane uttar pradesh main aresas-bijepi kii prishthbhumi vaale patibaddh obisi kaaryakartaaon ko tikat dekar obisi netritv kaa ek puraa pool hi nirmit kar diya he
 Are you going to do the same in other places? Our great leader Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya had envisaged Antyodaya - that is, it has been conceived to bring the fruits of development to the poor
 asal main ham to vahi kar rahe hai jo hamen apni vichaardhaara main sikhaaya gaya he

 At the same time, a river passes near the temple which has become dry but even in the scorching heat, water flows continuously from these hand pumps
 darshan ke liye badi sankhya main aate hai shraddhalulog dur-dur se yahaan puja karne aate hai or saal bhar mandir main shraddhaluon kaa tantaa laga rahata he
 Devotees believe that any devotee who sees this amazing form of God in the broken waterfall temple gets fulfilled
 bhakt shivlinga par girane valejal ko prasadke rup main grahan karte hai or ise apane ghar le jaakar rakh lete hai
 With the acceptance of this, the mind becomes calm and gets strength to fight the sufferings

 yatriyon ke pakistan main pravesh karne par sikh gurudwara prabandhak samiti or evecu trust praparty board ke adhikariyon ne tirthayatriyon kaa swaagat kiya
 This board is responsible for the maintenance of shrines of minority communities in the country

 In fact, according to the arrival of more passengers, arrangements were made but only 21 pilgrims arrived

 - input language bijepi ke bade bhai kii chhavi se baahar nahin aa paa rahi shivasenajab bijepi ke saath koi nahin tha, tab bhi saath the bala sahebmaharashtra main satta ke samanaantar chalata tha shivasena kaa shashan'main jo kahuunga kamalabai vahi karegi
 'bala Saheb Thackeray used to say this often in the eighties
 kamala bai se unka taatpary camel vaali party yani bhartiya janata party(bijepi) se thi
 Perhaps the same sentiment has become a permanent home for the BJP within the Shiv Sena
 isaki vajah bhi he
 When the new political unit of the Sangh became the BJP after the Jana Sangh, it had to fight a long battle for its existence in politics
 ek jamaane main bijepi siyaasi rup se achhut party maani jaati thi
 No party was willing to ally with BJP in central politics
 us daur main shivasena ne bijepi kaa saath diya
 This was the period when Bala Saheb used to speak in Mumbai
 unka aadesh kisi bhi prashasnic aadesh ke upar mana jaataa tha
 Shiv Sena's rule used to run like a parallel power
 vakt ke saath shivasena ke kandhe par savaar hokar maharashtra kii ranjiti main pravesh karne vaali bijepi ne apni takat badha lee
 His status changed from younger brother to elder brother
 loktantr main sankhyabal sabase bada sach he or us sachai main shivasena kahin naa kahin pichad gai
 Now the seat of Shiv Sena has reduced but its hank has not reduced
 jid shivasena kii pahachanahar haal main apni baat manwaane kii jid bala sahib ke jamaane se shivasena kii pahchaan he
 Actually, Shiv Sena has been synonymous with power in Mumbai for the last nearly five decades
 vidhansabha main agar kabhi gachha khaaya bhi to biemasi par ecchhatra shivasena kaa rajya kaayam rahaa
 The Shiv Sena and especially Balasaheb have settled in the veins of the Marathi people there on the pretext of Marathi identity
 pehali najar main bhale hi shivasena kaa ensipi or congress ke saath jane ko log uski mul bhaavana se alag maanate hai lekin siyasat main bahut si baaten kintu-parantu se pare hoti hai
 When the Shiv Sena was Vasant Sena, who understands the politics of Maharashtra, it is well known that the Congress has been behind the rise of Balasaheb and Shiv Sena in the beginning 
 us vakt kii sattadhari congress party ne kareeb do dashakon tak bal thakare kaa sahyog kiya
 During that time, the people with red flags had a big influence in Mumbai
 har baat par andolan se tang maharashtra kii tatkaaleen congress sarkaar ko usko jawaab dene vaala shaks chahie tha
 Congress saw that answer in Balasaheb
 congress ne communist andolan ko todane main thakare se madad lee
 In return, he assisted in raising the Shiv Sena
 un dinon maharashtra ke mukhyamantri the vasantrao nayak
 Because of his soft corner about Shiv Sena, people used to jokingly call Shiv Sena as 'vasant Sena'
 indira kaa samarthanvasantrao nayak ke baad bhi kai maukon par congress ke saath shivasena khadi najar ai thi
 The most important time in this was when Balasaheb supported the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi regarding the Emergency
 itnaa hi nahin jab indira gandhi ko 1978 main giraftaar kiya gaya to shivasena ne uske virodh main band kaa aahvaan bhi kiya tha
 Relationship with NCP Shiv Sena's relationship with Sharad Pawar, who sets the upcoming government in Puranam Maharashtra, is very old
 pavaar un logon main se the jinhen bala sahib apane yahaan sapariwaar ratribhoj par bulaayaa karte the
 In his autobiography 'on My Terms', Sharad Pawar has written - If Bala Saheb once told you his friend, then he spoke
 wo apni dosti hameshaa nibhaate the
 This incident is of September 2006 when my daughter Supriya was going to contest the Rajya Sabha elections
 bala sahib ne mujhe phone kiya
 He said, 'I am listening to Sharad Babu, our Supriya is going to contest elections and you never told me about it
 mujhe yah khabar dusron se kyon mil rahi he?'"maine kaha, 'shiv sena-bijepi gathbandhan ne pehle hi uske kilaaf ummidavaar utaar di he
 i thought why should i bother you
 'bal thakare bole- maine supriya ko tab se janata hum jab wo mere ghutanon ke baraabar hua karti thi
 None of my candidates will contest against Supriya
 tumhaari beti meri beti he
 i asked him- what will you do for the BJP? He replied- Don't worry about Kamalabai
 wo vahi karegi jo main kahuunga
 Why is Shiv Sena taking a big step to form a government with NCP and Congress on the strength of these strong ties that are coming together
 kehete hai ki siyasat main dushman ke saath-saath apane dost ko bhi takat dikhaani padati he
 This time the Shiv Sena is showing the same internal strength to the BJP
 vaise bijepi ke saath shivasena kii ye duuri koi pehali baar nahin hui he
 Especially after the arrival of the Modi government at the Center in 2014, the situation appeared tense several times
 aae din saamana main bijepi kii aalochana vaali hedline najar aati thi
 Shiv Sena's stance on domestic and international issues looked different even with the government
 tumhiin se mohabbat,tumhiin se ladaai kii tarj par shivasena-bijepi saath bani hui thi
 Everyone felt from the initial tussle that by bargaining with each other, they would form the government together again, but now the matter has moved forward
 shivasena iske liye sirf bijepi ko jimmedaar bataa rahi he
 Bala Saheb is being tasted with regard to the matter of 50-50 sharing of power
 apana mukhyamantri banane ke liye ensipi or congress kaa saath kabool kiya he
 Perhaps this is the beginning of political enmity between the two oldest NDA friends
 kya he siyasat kaa takaza?siyasat kaa ye takaza he
 Whenever the party is in a strong position, it imposes its condition on the other
 2019 chunaav se pehle jab desh main maahaul us tarah se pradhanmantri modi ke paksh main nahin dikh rahaa tha tab maharashtra main bijepi ne jhukkar shivasena se samjhauta kiya
 Compromised fewer seats than last time
 ye baat alag he ki jab parinaam unke paksh main aayaa
 Prime Minister Modi came back to power with more power than before
 iske baad pehali daraar shapathgrahan ke din hi dikhi jab shivasena ko cabinet main sirf ek hi jagah mili
 Eyeing Maharashtra Assembly elections at that time, Shiv Sena kept silence but opened its original card after the assembly elections
 satta kaa khel aisa he ki endie ko do sabase puraane dost aamane-saamne hai
 It is different that many people are questioning the new alliance standing in front of the throne of Maharashtra
 mahangaai kii aag se jali janata ke jakhmon par krishi mantri sharad pavaar kii party ne namak chhidakane kaa kaam kiya he
 The party's mouthpiece Nationalist advises people not to eat sugar
 jab chini kii chadhati keemat par krishi mantri sharad pavaar logon ke nishane par he, aise vakt main unki party ensipi ke mukhpatr rashtravaadi ne had hi kar di he
 The advice given by the mouthpiece in the defense of Sharad Pawar is also no less burning
 akhbaar ne likhaa he 'chini ko essencial camodity act ke tahat laane kii jarurat nahin, kyonki chini nahin khaane ko mili to koi marataa nahin
 Diabetes occurs by eating inverted sugar, and people give up sugar after diabetes
 isliye kisi ko chini khaane kii koi jarurat nahin'
 The politics is fine, so the party will defend Pawar, but he will start giving such advice to the people, these people are not digesting it
 udhar mahangaai ke mudde par satta paksh ko gherne main lagi bijepi ne ensipi kii is salaah par sawaal kiya he ki log kya kya khaanaa chhod den bijepi ne ensipi ke mukhpatr rashtravaadi main chhapi chini naa khaane kii baat ko bachakaani bataate hue is mudde par congress or ensipi donon se safai bhi maangi he
 So can whatsapp call be spied? The whatsapp call on which even the common man trusts that no one is listening, can also be hacked and heard with the help of some software
 yah bharosa tuutane par aapako kaisaa lagegaa, kya bhay hoga ki jis baatcheet ko aap gupt yaa nijee samaj kar kar rahe the, use koi sun rahaa tha
 Common people also use whatsapp calls
 wo apane saamaanya sim se baat nahin karte
 They know that if you want to talk privately then you have to make a whatsapp call, because this conversation cannot be recorded with the phone's software
 phone main baatcheet record kaa software hota he
 To avoid this, common people also make whatsapp calls
 whatsap yahi daawa karata he ki uski baatcheet surakshit he
 No one can listen
 thik he
 What would be the reaction if you knew that with the help of Israeli software, the conversation was being listened to comfortably, recorded
 yah kaam koun kar saktaa he yah ges karne ke liye aapako kitni baar dasvin main fail hona padegaa
 Not even once
 indian express kii seemaa chishti kii is report ne siharan paidaa kar di he
 We journalists already knew this, but why would anyone want to listen to a whatsapp call of a journalist, i will answer it further
 pehle aap indian express kii is khabar kii ek jhalak dekhie
 The first news of Seema Chishti is frightening
 yah report bataati he ki israel kii ek company ke software ke zarie 1400 logon ke phone kii jasusi kii gai he
 From the conversation on whatsapp, all the information contained within the phone can be handed over to the government agency
 in 1400 yuzar main se do darjan se adhik bhartiya hai
 Some of whom are lawyers, journalists, social workers working for Dalits and Adivasis and professors
 israel kii company enesao yah software banaati he jise 'pegssus' kehete hai
 In the name of combating terrorism, this software is being used to obtain information about the phone of common citizens
 jasusi karne ke liye kai tarah ke software hote hai jise spiware kaha jaataa he
 According to Seema Chishti, whatsapp had contacted more than two dozen journalists, lawyers and Dalit activists and told that the phone has been tracked for two weeks in May 2019
 whatsap ne yah sari jaankaree san francyssako kii adaalat main daayar apane halafname main di he
 whatsapp has refused to reveal the identity of any targeted consumer
 bharat ke bare main 2 darjan se adhik sankhya bataai ja rahi he magar sateek sankhya kii jaankaree nahin di ja rahi he
 whatsapp sued Israel's company in California court for violating US and California law
 whatsap kii seva sharton ko todaa he jo is tarah kii harkaton kii anumati nahin detaa he
 In this case, a company is accusing another private company of tampering its relationship with its user
 israel kii company enesao pegssus banaati he
 The company claims that it sells its software very thoughtfully and only to the government agency
 agar is software se kisi patrkaar ke phone kaa data liya gaya he, uske phone ke zarie uski har gatividhi ko record kiya gaya to yah chintaa kii baat he
 The Indian government has certainly asked for a response from whatsapp, but it should tell whether it has purchased the software of the NSO or not, and should give concrete answers that it is being used against journalists and lawyers
 kyonki whatsap kii taraf se jin logon ko phone gaya he usamen yahi bataaya gaya he ki aapaki sarkaar aapke phone par nazar rakh rahi he
 See the honesty and courage of this company
 bharat kii koi company hoti to sara data de aati or sarkaar kii tarif bhi kar aati
 Finally, when the Indian Express sought an email from the Home Secretary and the Telecom Secretary, no reply was given
 khabar ke saarvajanik hone par pratikriyaayein aa rahi hai
 The virus enters the smart phone through a missed call and starts collecting all the information
 phone kaa camera on ho jaataa he or pataa chalane lagata he ki aap kahaan ja rahe hai, kisase mil rahe hai or kya baat kar rahe hai
 Why this is a serious matter agar patrakaron ke phone ko is tarah tap kiya jane lage to bachi khuchi namak baraabar patrakarita he wo bhi samaapt ho jaaegi
 In our profession, it is important that we keep our source of conversation secret
 agar koi phone trek karegaa to sorce kii baat nahin karenge or is tarah aapke paas suchanaaen nahin pahonchegi
 Scared journalist will be scared
 aapako kahani bech di jaaegi aatank yaa deshadroh kii, lekin uske peeche kaa iraadaa kuch or hoga
 Therefore, taping the phone of a journalist is a very serious matter
 2 aktubar 2018 ko yani gandhi jayanti ke din istambul main saudi arab ke duutavas main washington post ke patrkaar jamaal khashogi kii hatya kar di gai thi
 His phone was being tracked with the help of the same software, which is being discussed after the report of Indian Express
 sab pataa chal rahaa tha ki khashogi kisase mil rahaa he, kiske paas ja rahe hai
 His friends have sued the company that makes the software
 enesao ne saudi sarkaar se apana qaraar khatm kar liya he
 All these things are upside-down
 bheetar-bheetar kya hota he, aap jaan hi nahin paaenge
 Therefore, this question is important and serious that the information of journalists whose information has been collected with the help of this software is not at risk
 unke ghar waalon kii jaan kaa khatra to nahin he
 In different media reports the names of ten people whose phones have been hacked through this software
 pro anand teltumbade, goa institute of management Ashish Gupta, People's Union for Democratic Rights saroj giri, dilli vishvavidhyalay ke sahaayak professor hai The Vienne channel principles are Sibal rajeev sharma swatantra patrkaar hai Shubhranshu Chaudhary, former journalist BBC bela bhaatia, saamaajik adhikaar kaaryakarta DP Chauhan social rights activist roopali jadhav, kabir kala manch Shalini Gera is associated with Jagdalpur Legal Aid Group in Chhattisgarh ajmal khan, tata institute of soshal science Seema Azad, People's Union for Civil Liberties vivek sundar, paryaavaran or saamaajik adhikaar kaaryakarta Nehal Singh Rathore is a lawyer from Nagpur, runs the Human Rights Law Network
 All the names are those who take the risk and fight the case for the common people
 jinhen jhuthe mukademon main fansaaya jaataa he
 What would have been the aim of targeting these people? enesao apni website par likhata he ki vah sakht prakriyaaon ke baad hi kisi ko apana software bechata he, lekin software kharidne ke baad koi kaise istemaal karegaa is par enesao kaa koi vash nahin hota he
 There are many such reports in the media, which shows that this software purchased in the name of security is used to monitor journalists and political opponents of different countries
 unpar hamalaa karne main kiya jaataa he
 According to Business Insider's report by Becky Peterson on 6 September 2019, the number of companies like NSO in Israel is more than two dozen
 enesao kii laagat ek billian amareki dollar tak aanki gai he
 According to Peterson, the NSO had a profit of $ 125 million last year
 hamane unalogon se baat kii he jinke paas whatsap se phone aayaa tha ki unka phone hack ho chukaa he
 All phones are coming from Citizen Lab
 yah canada ke uniwarsity of toronto kaa lab he jo whatsap ke saath kaam karata he
 In September 2018, Canada's cyber security group Citizen Lab said it had detected 33 Pegasus operators in 45 countries
 isaki report ke anusaar june 2017 se sitambar 2018 ke bich pegssus ke link aaparative the
 An operator is a ganja that uses the domain of political themes
 sarkarein aapke adhikaar kshetra main suraksha ke naam par pravesh kar jaati hai, lekin jab unka phone tap hota he to jaanch hone lagati he
 The government collapses
 abhi karnataka main jaanch ho rahi he ki kumaraswami sarkaar ne bijepi netaaon ke phone tap karaae
 When it is wrong for them, why is it not wrong for you? There is a spy in your pocket
 yah jasoos kiske ishaare par kaam kar rahaa he
 It is important to know
 ham brake ke baad technolji lair or privesi ke adhikaron ko lekar kaam karne vaali mishi choudhary se baat karenge
 Telecom Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad is participating in Ekta rally in Patna
 sardaar patel kii jayanti ke din yah khabar acchhee to nahin he ki desh main israeli technic se patrakaron or vakil ke phone kii jasusi ho rahi he
 Ravi Shankar Prasad has issued a statement that the government is worried
 bharat ke nagarikon kii niztaa ke ulanghan ko lekar
 We have asked whatsapp about this violation
 poocha he ki vah nagarikon kii niztaa ke liye kya kar rahi he
 The Government of India is committed to protecting the privacy of all citizens
 centre or rajya sarkaar main manzuri ke baad hi kisi kaa phone tap ho saktaa he, intercept ho saktaa he
 Those who want to take political advantage should remember that the bug was planted in Pranab Mukherjee's house during the UPA time, to record the conversation
 raksha mantri wike singh kii jasusi kii gai thi
 At the behest of any one family
 ravishankar prasad ko yah bhi bataanaa chahie ki supreme court main mukul rohtagi ne tab atarni general kii haisiyat se court main kaha tha ki logon kaa apane sharir par sampurna adhikaar nahin he

 On the spinners' good performance bowling later, he said that we wanted to pressure them to defend the target and it was very good

 The Samajwadi Party has suddenly changed its national executive meeting to be held on September 11-12

 For the last one month, party leaders in Haridwar were finalizing the preparations for the meeting but suddenly the meeting was changed
 is faisle ke peeche kai raajnneetik pahalu hai
 a SP state secretary says that in the past, the party's national general secretary Ram Gopal Yadav had come to Lucknow and met Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav and other big leaders of the party and decided that the Lok Sabha seats of western UP should be given more attention
 isaki sabase badi vajah yah he ki pashchimi upi kii kareeb 30 siton par muslim aabaadi kii acchhee khaasi sankhya he
 There are only five Lok Sabha seats in Uttarakhand and the SP does not even have an effective support base

 However, SP state spokesperson Rajendra Chaudhary says that Uttarakhand is facing a major natural disaster, so the meeting of the working committee was changed

this time before the Lok Sabha elections, senior party leaders in Agra will sit together and discuss their strengths and weaknesses
 party agle loksabhaa chunaav main 60 siten jeetne kaa lakshya lekar chal rahi he
 Party strategists believe that even if SP wins 45 to 50 seats, it will be the largest party in the Third Front and this will strengthen sp's national president Mulayam Singh Yadav's claim to the post of Prime Minister
 upi ke itar bhi hogi charchaagara kii baithak main upi ke sabhi 76 loksabhaa pratyaashiyon kii parfarmens report par charchaa to hogi hi, saath main duusare pradeshon kii un siton ko bhi chihnit kiya jayega jahaan sapa apana ummidavaar utaaregi

 Shahrukh is a very 'positive' friend
 mujhe lagata he ki jab main unke bina koi film banaata hum to main unhen takalif pahunchaata hum or mujhe lagata he ki jab main aisa karata hum to mujhe bhi bura lagata he kyonki us samay mujhe unase pitrutv yaa bhaichaare vaali feeling nahin aati jo pehle mujhe unase aati thi

 ramdev ne jis tarah se dalit yuvatiyon kaa apmaan kiya he, iske liye unhen tatkaal jail bheja janaa chahie
 Mayawati said that the Samajwadi Party (SP) government in Uttar Pradesh will not take action against Baba Ramdev, as he is associated with the Yadav community

 GST kii vajah se ganesh ji kii murtiyon dedh guni tak mahangi ho gai hai
 The cost of the idols has increased due to the GST being imposed on clothes by 5 percent, color by 18 and beauty by 28 percent
 isaki vajah se murtiyon kaa kaarobaar thanda pad gaya he
 After Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh is the state where house-to-house Ganesh idols are installed
 ganesh utsav aane vaala he, lekin karigar haath par haath dhare baithe hai kyonki graahakon kaa tota he
 According to the sculptors, despite providing Ganesh idols at No Profit No Loss, devotees are unable to muster the courage to buy it

 Customers are not known far and wide

 But GST has changed the way that business has come to a standstill
 gaahe bagaahe bhakt aate hai, lekin murtiyon kaa daam sun kar nau do gyaarah ho jate hai
 What should artisans do too
 isliye mahangi huin murtiyanmurtiyon banane ke upyog main istemaal hone vaale kachche maal se lekar saundarya samagriyon par GST lag gaya he
 Due to this, many things have become expensive
 isse murtiyon ke daam main bhi fark padaa he
 The idols which used to be Rs 21 hundred before the implementation of GST, they have now directly become Rs 36 hundred
 yahi nahin choti murtiyon ke daam main bhi 35 se 40 fisadi tak ijapha ho gaya he
 Sculptors say that they have not increased the price of the sculptures, but the price of the sculptures has increased due to the increase in the price of the materials that make it

 In such a situation, the price of idols is bound to increase

 According to him, the business of sculpture has come to a standstill due to the expensive use of common objects
 bhakt murti kaa vaastavik daam bhi dene ko taiyaar nahin hai
 In such a situation, they are having difficulty in extracting the cost price

 The family of more than 10 thousand artisans in the state depends only on idol art
 saal bhar raipur kii mana basti main murtiyon banaai jaati hai
 From here, idols of Ganesh ji, Durga ji and Kali ji are also sent to the neighboring states of the state, but this time there are no orders to sculptors from Maharashtra, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh and Jharkhand as before
 murtiyon ke kaarobaar main GST ke lagu hone ke pehle kabhi bhi mandi nahin ai
 All the idols are sold hands-on at the festival
 yahi nahin murtikaron ko itane adhik booking order milte hai ki wo badi kathinaayee se bhakton ko murtiyon muhaiyaa kara pate hai, lekin ye pehla mauka he jab murtikaron ko bhakton kii raah taakani pad rahi he

 Taking an aggressive stance on the killing of RSS workers in Kerala, the BJP went on a long march against the state's Left government
 padayatra main party adhyaksh amit shah sahit party ke tamaam varisht netaaon ko utaar diya gaya
 But when the opposition from the Left at the local level intensified, the BJP ended its program

 Prime Minister Modi and party president Amit Shah held public meetings here in bulk

 Seeing this aggressive attitude of the BJP, Mamata Banerjee too took her stand aggressive and started making sharp attacks on the Prime Minister

 The BJP protested against the Kolkata incident at Jantar Mantar in Delhi instead of Bengal

 The TMC in Kolkata succeeded in conveying the message that the BJP people broke the 200-year-old statue of Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar

 After getting caught in the political stakes, the BJP has decided to soften Bengal's aggressive election campaign before the last phase

 Preliminary investigation by Delhi Police has revealed that the young man is around 45 years of age, though he has not been identified yet
 saath hi yah bhi nahin pataa chalaa sakaa he ki aakhir yuvak ne metro (delhi Metro) ke aage chalaang kyon lagaai
 The police is currently investigating the entire case

 com / 4rsqt2xikpxilli metro ke anusaar is ghatana ke baad huda city centre kii taraf jane vaali metro kii seva baadhit hui he
 Because of this, ordinary travelers are facing a lot of trouble
 gauratlab he ki metro ke aage khudakushi karne kii koshish kaa yah koi pehali ghatana nahin he
 Earlier one such case came last year
 apni patni ke avaidh sambandhon se pareshaan or hataash ek varisht naagarik ne dilli metro train ke aage kudakar aatmahatya kar lee thi
 The incident was of GTB Nagar metro station
 us dauraan police ne bataaya tha ki shaam 3:20 baje ek varisht naagarik ne train ke plateform number ek par train ke aage chalaang laga di
 The deceased was identified as 60-year-old Banarsi Das
 ek varisht police adhikari ne bataaya tha ki adarsh nagar nivasee banarsi das ko babu jagjivan ram aspataal le jaaya gaya, jahaan uski maut ho gai thi
 Mohan Bhagwat said, "A year ago i myself said that be patient
 ab main hi kah rahaa hum ki dhairya se kaam nahin hoga
 Now we need to unite people
 ab hamen kanoon kii maang kerani chahie
 "whatever the reason," said Bhagwat, "whatever the reason is because the court does not have time or the Ram temple case is not in their priority or possibly they are not able to understand the sensitivity of the society
" aise main sarkaar ko chahie ki vah is bare main vichaare ki mandir nirmaan ke liye kaise ek kanoon laayaa jaye
 
 
 The law should be brought at the earliest
 ''unhone kaha, ‘‘ab yah andolan kaa nirnaayak charan he
 Earlier, Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray, who reached Ayodhya, had said that the central government had every right to construct the Ram temple this time
 agar vah aisa nahin karti he to main aapako daawey ke saath kah saktaa hum ki yah sarkaar dobaaraa nahin banegi
 VIDEO: Ayodhya turned into a fort with respect to the Parliament of Religion
 haryana ke deyari kisaan pahalu khan ko 2017 main peet-petakar maar dene ke aaropee chah log adaalat se bari ho gaye
 Alwar's Additional District and Sessions Judge Sarita Swamy, in her judgment on 14 August, countered the negligence of the police investigation and questioned her
 bachaav paksh ke vakil ne reportron se kaha ki police ne 'kai khamiyaan' chhod di thim, jinamein ek yah thi ki abhiyukton kii pahchaan karne vaale video ko forensik jaanch ke liye bheja hi nahin gaya
 In December 2018, Ashok Gehlot, the Chief Minister of the Congress government replacing the BJP, has set up a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to investigate and rectify the flaws
 khan ke bete irshaad ne kaha ki unke parivaar ko dhakka laga he par ve maamle ko upree adaalaton main jarur le jaaenge
 The Gehlot government has also indicated an appeal against the verdict
 haalanki, jaanch par najar rakhane vaale kisi bhi shaks ko police kii koshishon ko lekar adaalat kii tikhi aalochana se koi hairaani nahin hui
 Right from the beginning, political lobbies, pressure groups and activists were closely monitoring the investigation of the police
 khan kii peet-petakar hatya or unke haathon sambhavat: gaay kii taskari ke maamalon main ek saath jaanch shuru kar di gai thi
 As Khan had reported, he was stopped and beaten by a crowd of around 200 people on jaipur-delhi highway near Behror in Rajasthan on 1 April 2017
 khan ke mutabik, ek meley se vaid tareeke se kharide maweshiyon ko saath lekar ve apane grihnagar laut rahe the
 Those involved in his brutal beating were seen in the video, allegedly 19-year-old 'student leader' Vipin Yadav
 uskaa naam mul pratham soochna report (exiar) main nahin tha
 In the same FIR, Khan, who was hospitalized and bled, gave the names of the six people in the crowd
 cellphone ke data ke aadhaar par yah bataakar ki ye sabhi chah log ghatnasthaal par maujuud nahin the, police ne sitambar 2017 main unhen clinit de di thi
 Investigating policemen had surprised in front of the media that the area was not known to Khan, how did he name the six people
 vaise khan ne jin logon ke naam liye, unke khilaaf aaropapatr daakhil kar diya gaya
 The police also filed charges against Khan, as he found no evidence that he had purchased the cattle found in his truck
 khan ke bete daawa karte hai ki maweshiyon kii kharid ke kagajaat bhi kathith gorakshakon ne tahas-nahas kar die
 Two days after the assault, Khan, who was hospitalized, asked the doctors if he could go home
 doctoron ne manaa kar diya tha
 Khan died a few hours later
 doctoron kaa kahana tha ki unhen dil kaa daura padaa tha or 1 april, 2017 ko unhen dil ke visheshgy doctor ke paas le jaaya gaya tha
 But in the autopsy report, the cause of death was said to be internal bleeding from broken ribs; His lungs and chest muscles were also shattered
 khan kii maut ko lekar desh bhar main koharaam much gaya or police par doshiyon ko pakadaaey kaa dabaav ban gaya
 a police officer involved in the initial investigation even claimed that 'left-wing activists' would 'teach the strip' to nominate local guards who were considered close to the BJP and the RSS
 ye bhi kayaas lagaae gaye ki ek police afasar ne khan ke dastakhat vaale sade kaagaj par ye chah naam jod die
 The court said that the police did not appear to make any effort to find out how these six names came up in the FIR
 aktubar, 2017 main yadav or teen naaballigon sahit nau logon ke naam ek nai exiar main daal die gaye
 They were identified based on cellphone footage of the scene
 alvar kii adaalat kii jaj ne kaha ki is footage par itane daag-dhabbe the ki usase yah puri tarah sabit nahin hota ki aropit shaks vahi the jinhone khan ko peeta
 The judge also refused to accept as evidence the confidential video of a TV journalist, in which Yadav had allegedly boasted about his involvement in the incident
 vahiin jis mobile phone se ghatana kaa video banaaya gaya tha, uske maalik ko adaalat main pesh nahin kiya gaya
 It was also not clear before the court whether the footage of the mobile phone was sent to the forensic lab for verification
 adaalat ko police kii prakriya ko lekar bhi andeh tha, khaskar tab jab nae aropiyon kii pahchaan ke liye na to parade karwaai gai or na hi irshaad aropiyon ko adaalat main pahchaan sake
 Not only this, the police said that while coming to court last September, there was no evidence of firing on Ershad and his accomplices
 zyaadaatar dosha jaanch adhikariyon ke maththe madha ja rahaa he kyonki ve adaalat main pukhta maamla pesh nahin kar paae
 Apparently, the hope of justice for Khan's family is now dependent on the SIT
 modi sarkaar ne april 2015 main mudra yojana kii shuruyaat karte hue deshbhar main chote or madhyam kaarobaar shuru karne ke liye lakhon karod rupee ke aasaan karj baante
 The intention of the government behind the disbursement of this debt was to boost business as well as generate new employment resources in the country
 lekin teen saal se chal rahi is yojana ne ab sarkaar kii neend uda di he
 The central government fears that the npas of banks in the country may not increase even with the Mudra scheme and its efforts to revive the banks may be lost
 mudra yojana ke tahat kendra sarkaar ne teen saal ke dauraan lagbhag 5 lakh karod rupee kaa karj dene kaa kaam kiya he
 Some reports published in the media are claiming that the NPA has exceeded the figure of Rs 14 thousand crore in these loans given under the Mudra scheme
 haalanki ek hindi akhbaar dwaara enpie kii rakam ke is daawey kii pushti vitt mantralay athwa banking vyavastha se nahin ho saki he
 On the other hand, according to the government data, a total of 1 under the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana during the financial year 2017-18
 81 lakh karod rupee kaa karj sweekrut kiya gaya jisamen 1
 a loan of 75 lakh crore rupees was given
 haalanki is vitt varsh ke liye kendra sarkaar ne kul 2
 The target of loan allocation was Rs 44 lakh crore
 vahiin vitt varsh 2016-17 main yah laksh mahaj 1
 80 lakh crores
 ise padhein: ab pradhanmantri mudra yojana main bhi frod, phir PNB ko lagi chapatagauratlab he k pradhanmantri modi ne mudra yojana ko 8 april 2015 main shuru kiya tha or is yojana ke tahat teen shreneon main karj dene kaa praavdhaan he
 First, Shishu loan (up to Rs 50,000), Second, Kishore loan (rs 50,000 to Rs 5 lakh) and Third Tarun loan (rs 5 lakh to Rs 10 lakh)
 is yojana ke tahat sookshm, laghu or madhyam kaarobaar ke liye liye jane vaale karj ko bina kisi coletteral security ke tahat dene kaa praavdhaan he
 The central government's intention behind promoting such loans is to create new resources of maximum employment in the country
 kendra sarkaar kii is payalat yojana kaa karj desh main sarkari bank, gaiyr banking vittiya sanstha or micro finance sansthaaon ke jariye diya jaataa he
 In view of the Central Government's data, a total of 4,03,89,854 people were given Mudra loans during the financial year 2017-18
 vahiin yojana ke praavdhaan ke mutabik 75 fisadi tak yah karj mahilaon ko diya gaya he or 50 fisadi tak ke mudra karj anusuchit jati, anusuchit janajati or anya pichde virgon ko diya gaya he
 Experts claim that these provisions of the Mudra scheme increase the risk factor of debt
 vahiin banking se jude kuch exparts kaa daawa he ki mudra yojana ke tahat kisi vyakti ko ek baar karj dene ke baad uske upkram ke liye rifinensingh naganya ke baraabar he jiske chalate mudr karj lene waalon ke saamne shuruaati ghaataa khaane kii sthiti main dubaara khadey hone ke liye rifinancing kii samasya rahati he
 At the same time, under the Mudra scheme, all the lending work has to be done by public sector banks, which are already caught in the serious problem of NPA
 gauratlab he ki kendra sarkaar ne haal hi main sarkari bainkon ko enpie se ubaarane ke liye 2
 a recapitalization draft of Rs 11 lakh crore has been drafted so that banks can reduce the risk in their new loan allocation
 haalanki mudra yojana ke tahat kendra sarkaar ne lagaataar bainkon par dabaav bana rakhaa he ki vah kendra sarkaar ke mudra lone ke lakshya ko samay se puraa karen
 So, in these circumstances, the question arises whether the Mudra scheme has posed a double challenge to the banks
 ek taraf vah sarkaar se package lekar apane enpie ko sudhaarney kii kavayad kar rahe hai, vahiin duusari taraf sarkaar ke dabaav main mudra yojana kaa asurakshit karj dekar vah apane enpie ko badhaane kaa rasta saaf kar rahe hai?

 akhilesh ne bhavishya main kisi mahagathbandhan kii sambhaavna par kaha ki isapar abhi kuch nahin kah sakate, abhi hamaara congress se gathbandhan he
 Akhilesh said that i am now waiting for the day when you people will show the news on the murder-rape incidents in UP with the photo of Yogi in the same way as i used to show
