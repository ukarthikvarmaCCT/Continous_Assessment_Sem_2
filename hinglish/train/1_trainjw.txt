 " He said that a team of special crime branch including forensic experts will be headed by Deputy Inspector General of Police Madhukar Tiwari
 sibiai ke ek adhikari ne kaha, "shuukravaar ko dal uttar pradesh ke liye ravaanaa hoga
 The Uttar Pradesh government has been requested to provide logistical support to the investigation team
 " An officer said that the Special Crime Branch is a part of the CBI

 According to a CBI official, it is alleged that on the evening of May 27, when the two teenagers went to the Khots for defecation, they were abducted by the three accused brothers
 adhikari ne bataaya, "is apharan ke gavaah katra, sadatganj police chaowkee gaye or donon police constablon ko isaki jaankaree di, lekin sakriyata baratane kii jagah unhone ulte uski pitayee kii or gaaliyaan di

 uttar pradesh kii yogi sarkaar ab rajya ke madrason par puri nigaraanee kaa man bana rahi he, yahi vajah he ki sarkaar ke alpsankhyak vibhaag ne ek aadesh jari kar madrason ke liye bane portal par tamaam jaankariyon ko bhejnaa anivaary kar diya he

 vahaan farji shikshak, farji teaching staff or farji chaatravrutti par roak lagegi or sarkaar paardarshee tareeke se madrason ko chalaa sakegi

 The government ministers are not considering it as monitoring of madrasas, Minister Baldev Singh Aulakh says that it should not be seen in the wrong perspective but to make the madrasas more transparent, these steps have been taken and if necessary, more steps will be taken

 Today, profits on gold smuggling have increased compared to before because the import duty on gold before 2012 was two percent, which is currently at 10 percent
 isamen rajyon kii kar ugaahi ko joden to yah 12 fisadi par pahunch jaataa he
 There is one more important thing here

 09 per cent declined and the price of gold reached 10 months old (as of February 2016)
 sutron ke mutabik desh main har maheene kareeb 20 ton sona taskari ke jariye aata he
 While bringing gold through smuggling in India will have the advantage of avoiding import duty, the gold just brought will reduce the impact of demonetisation and once again fill the gold prices with huge profits
 yahi kaaran he ki 9 november ko vimudrikaran ke baad se akele indira gandhi antarrashtriya hawaii adde par hi 500 or 1000 ke puraane noton, america dollar, euro or afgani karency ke alaava 35 kilo sona kii taskari ko bhi naakaam kiya ja chukaa he jisaki keemat 9 karod rupee se bhi adhik aanki ja rahi he
 But this only signifies the cumin-like proverb in the camel's mouth because while some people fail to throw dust in the eyes of the customs officials, there is a huge amount of gold smuggling that continues unabated

 ‚Äô adaalat ne donon pakshon se ek aise vakil ko bhi khojane ke liye kaha, jo kankani bhashaa jaanata ho taaki vah furnandis ke bayaan ke anuwaad main madad kar sake
 The court was told that Fernandes speaks English and also speaks with his brothers in Konkani language
 iske baad adaalat ne is babat yah aadesh diya
 The leader's brothers also sought permission from the court to relocate him to his official residence at his wife's residence 3, Krishna Menon Marg in Panchsheel Park

 Fernandes' brothers on Thursday filed a new application seeking to set up a medical board to ascertain their condition
 unhone yah bhi chaha ki furnandis kii ichha kaa pataa lagane ke liye ek sthaneey ayukta kii niyukti kii jaae
 This was opposed by Laila Kabir's lawyer, who alleged that the brothers had not met him for a month
 furnandis ko apane saath rakhane ke liye unke bhaaiyon tathaa laila kabir main chal rahi ladaai main buudhvaar ko dilli sthit netaa ke aadhikarik awaas ke baahar hangaamaa khadaa ho gaya
 The two brothers of the leader along with his colleague Jaya Jaitley arrived at the 3 Krishna Menon Marg residence to collect books and furniture which they claim were his own but the police stopped him from entering as SD Singh, the caretaker of the house, objected to his entry

 vividhta main ekta dekhni ho, to bharat desh ek bejod namoona he
 The political parties of our country claim to carry every color and ideology
 ye spectrum bhagava se shuru hokar hare tak jaataa he or bich main safed rang to he hi
 But this thing is not limited to national parties only
 apane-apane ilaakon ke hiton kii raksha karne kaa daawa karti kshetreey partiyaan bhi isamen shaamil hai
 Whenever the eyes are on the Parliament or the Legislative Assemblies, we see elected representatives of political parties quarreling like dogs
 bhala aisa or kahaan dekhne ko milegaa ki ek jagah jo vaad vivaad or samvaad ke liye tay kii gai he, vahaan microphone or kursiyon kaa istemaal missile kii tarah virodhiyon par hamalaa karne ke liye ho
 Here shoes are left in their natural place and feet are seen in the hands and go on their unnatural journey by targeting the head of another
 magar ye sab sochakar agar ham ye khushrahmi paal len ki raajnneeti vibhaajankaree he, to yah galatfahami hi hogi
 Our political parties may have the ability to debate even on the issues of consent, but when it comes to the important decisions that determine the direction and condition of politics, they all look roundly under the same umbrella
 agar fori masale kii baat karen to ye sabhi rajnatik dal, chaahe ve kisi bhi rang or vichaar ke hon, yah nahin chaahate ki bharat kii janata jiske pratinidhi hone kaa vah swang karte hai, yah jane ki dal apane daldal main kaise duubate utaraate hai
 In a flat tone, what is the way of functioning of these parties
 raajnneetik dal chaahate hai ki paardarshee gilaas main bhare dhoosar dravya kii tarah vah dikhakar bhi dhundhale hi rahen
 These days the multi-colored coalition UPA ruling the country is headed by the Congress Party
 yah baar-baar apni raajnneetik uplabdhiyon main soochna kaa adhikaar act ko ginawati he
 This RTI Act gives a common man the right to get the right to information
 use bas kisi bhi sarkari daftar main ek arji daakhil kerani he or iske jariye vah kharch hone vaali ek ek pai kaa hisaab puch saktaa he
 In the original form of the Act, discussions that determine the manner of this expenditure were excluded from the public's jurisdiction to know
 lekin is par bhi lagaataar sawaal uthaae ja rahe hai
 Now the same rti's drum-footed Congress party is bringing a bill, so that it can be decided that the economic activities of political parties should not come to the knowledge of the public
 vipaksh kaa morcha sanbhale hai endie kii sirmaur bhartiya janata party
 Looking at the activities of the last few years, the BJP is determined to oppose every proposal that the ruling UPA presents
 yah vipaksh kaa pavitra kartavya bhi he or bijepi jab tak galaa faadti he, taaki logon ko shashan karne vaale gathbandhan ke kukarmon kaa pataa chal sake
 But as soon as the matter came about to wash the political parties of the Indian people, their tearing throat got teared
 ve nahin chaahate ki log jaane ki baari bharkam reliyon main kitna kharchaa or kahaan se aata he
 Communists who stand up to their poverty are also standing in this hammam
 vah bhi chaahate hai ki unka garib arth tantra artiai ke daayre se baahar rahe or janata kii us par najar na pade
 Regional parties are also vigorously guarding Hamam's door, so that no one peeps and their naked truth is revealed
 raajnneetik dalon ke aarthik kriyakalapon ko artiai ke daayre main laane kii pairvi karne waalon kaa tark he ki raajnneeti main bhrashtachar kii jad raajnneeti ko dhan muhaiyaa karaane ke maujuuda rang dhang hai
 Not even 24 hours have passed, senior BJP leaders accept Gopinath Munde to do whatever the Election Commission wants to do, but the truth is that elections cannot be contested within its limit of lakhs of rupees and Munde himself has defied the rules
 Has committed crores of elections in elections
 magar yah to sirf ek netaa yaa kahen ki pratyaashee kaa sach he
 The whole truth is that every political party needs billions of rupees to show its status and there is so much cash in its bag
 bas hamen ye pataa nahin chal paata ki ye paisa detaa koun he
 But it is clear that whoever gives money to these political parties, they will earn a big profit in return for their investment and the real thing will come back
 isiilie har chunaav ke pehle is corporate funding ke naam par khajaane khol die jate hai
 This is the information age
 bataaya jaataa he ki ham soochnaaon kii bharmaar vaale ek haive par safar kar rahe hai
 But when we knock on the doors of political parties through the road, these doors turn into a wall, a very strong, never stumbling wall
 sach yah he ki sarkaar hamase judi har soochna jaananaa chaahati he
 The public will bluff themselves and pour all their secrets in the form of information, for this, the strategy like Aadhar scheme is created
 usee janata ke liye raajnneetik dalon kii soochna jaanane kaa ek jariya artiai ho saktaa tha
 But no, all these political parties want is to ask for votes every five years without knocking in your unwanted homes
 inhen bas aapkaa vot chahie, aapaki wo takat chahie, jiske jariye inaki satta ko lagaataar khuraaq or vaidhata milti rahe
 You should not ask for the right to enter their house or to know the movements there
 aisi maang saamne aate hi ye baharupie khud ko ek nijee sanghathan bataane lagate hai, jo soochna ke adhikaar ke daayre se baahar kii cheez he
 But the truth is that the fate and future of India is not decided by the political parties that run it and compete for it
 or jab tak ye raajnneetik dal privet party kii tarah act karte rahenge, desh ko mutthi bhar log apane dhang se haankate rahenge
 It is a thing of the past when some kings, nobles and landlords were in our hands
 par kya vaaki wo jamaana guzar gaya? BJP has given Murder, Scam accused in Jharkhand Assembly, Ticketindia Today Conclave MP Nishikant Dubey defended Nishikant Dubey said that it is normal in politics to make such allegations Has given tickets bijepi alag tarah kii party hone kaa daawa karti rahi he, lekin kya hamaam main sabhi nange hai? jharkhand ke devgarh se bijepi saansad nishikant dube isse ittefaq nahin rakhte
 Addressing an important session at the India Today Conclave East, Dr

 Significantly, before the Jharkhand Legislative Assembly elections, many other leaders of other parties have joined BJP

 What message do you want to give by giving tickets to such people? You had talked about changing politics in the country, but what is the change? On this question, Dubey said, 'talking of dynasty, only one ticket was given to the family of Suryadev Singh ji in Jharkhand, we gave ticket to his wife
 shashibhushan mehta ko bhi loar court ne abhi aaropee nahin mana he
 There was no first charge against my family, but when i landed in the election, a case of attempt to murder 307 was filed against me and my wife
 jis din main sansad main bhaashan de rahaa tha, mere upar essi-asti act laga diya gaya
 Our political system is such that the way the police works, anyone is charged
 'unhone kaha ki jab court faisla karegaa, sajaa ho jaae to main yah maanoonga ki party ne galati kii he
 Shasibhushan Mehta, who was elected from Sejharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM), Panchi assembly constituency in Palamu district, was fiercely beaten in the party office in Ranchi during his induction into BJP

 pidipi, neshnal conference or congress ko aade haath lete hue unhone in partiyon par aarope lagaaya ki maharaja hari singh ko jammu kashmir ke itihaas main uchit sthaan nahin diya gaya
 Raina said, "maharaja Hari Singh was a great administrator who was turned villain by the National Conference and Congress
 samjhauta patr par hastakshar karne ke baad congress ne unke saath bura bartaav kiya
 He was expelled
 lekin ab ham yah sunishchit karenge ki unhen nyaay mili
 We want the highest civilian honor of the country for Maharaja Hari Singh

 "meanwhile, Congress has alleged that BJP is raising this demand for political reasons
 bhaajapa par hamalaa bolte hue jammu kashmir congress ke pravaktaa ravinder sharma ne kaha ki bhagava party logon kii bhaavana kaa sammaan nahin karti he kyonki vah maharaja hari singh ke janmdiwas par aadhikarik avkaash ghoshit karwaane main naakaam rahi he
 Ravinder Sharma told India Today, "the BJP had promised to declare the birthday of Maharaja Hari Singh an official holiday

 unhone aarope lagaaya ki jab sarkaar bill ke bare main notification par faisla lene main do din laga sakati he, to samajha ja saktaa he ki bill ke raste main abhi or kitni baadhaaen aaengi
 On the other hand, Kapil Sibal has changed the tone as the controversy escalates
 kapil ne safai di he ki unhone samiti ke khilaaf kabhi kuch nahin kaha or sirf yahi kaha ki keval lokapal bill se kaam nahin chalegaa, kyonki ye bill sirf ek samasya par kendrit he
 Sibal said that he, along with Anna Hazare, will give a good shape to the Jan Lokpal Bill
 unhone kaha ki bill kii prakriya or praavdhaanon par drafting samiti main vichaar hoga
 He refused to speak on the issue of seeking resignation

 According to information recorded in the Registrar of Companies, Deepak Kochhar, husband of ICICI Bank Chief Chanda Kochhar, together with Dhoot, formed a joint company in December 2008 in the name of Nupower Renewables Private Limited (NRPL)
 is company main share jis tarah ek duusare ko transfar kiye gaye, usko lekar dhoot or deepak kochar kii kaarobaari saajhedaari ko lekar ab gambhir sawaal ubhare hai
 The Dhoot family had a 50 per cent stake in NRPL, which baffled the transfer of shares and the remaining shares were held by Pacific Capital, owned by Deepak Kochhar and his family
 ek saal baad hi janvari 2009 main dhoot ne NRPL ke diarector pad se istipha de diya or apane kareeb 25,000 share deepak kochar ko hastantarit kar die
 In addition, in March 2010, Supreme Energy Private Limited, a company owned by Dhoot, gave a secured loan of Rs 64 crore to NRPL
 lekin phir march 2010 tak supreme energy ne NRPL kaa bahul swaamitv apane haath main le liya or deepak kochar ke paas sirf 5 fisadi swaamitv bachaa
 About eight months later, Dhoot transferred the entire stake of Supreme Energy to one of his associates, Mahesh Chandra Panglia
 phir iske kareeb do saal baad pangalia ne company kii apni puri hissedari sirf 9 lakh rupee main deepak kochar kii company pinakal energy ko transfar kar di
 Dhoot described the allegations as baseless? Dhoot has justified the sale of his shares
 unhone isamen kisi bhi tarah kii gadabadi se inkaar kiya he
 Dhoot has said that he had sold his participation because he got busy with his other work in the group
 ICICI bank ne kiya bachaavaisiaisiai bank ne apni siio kaa bachaav kiya he
 The bank has said that no person in the bank is capable enough to influence the credit decisions of the bank
 share bazaar ko bheji soochna main bank ne kaha ki board ne rin manjuuri kii bank kii aantarik prakriyaaon kii bhi samiksha kii he or unhen thos paaya he
 The bank said, "the board has come to the conclusion that the alleged rumors that there are allegations of lending for profit or conflict of interest do not arise
" ''karj dene main koi gadabadi nahin'videokon samooh ko karj ke bare main bank ne kaha he ki yah rin bainkon ke gathjod kii vyavastha ke tahat diya gaya tha
 The bank said that ICICI was not the dominant bank in the tie-up
 bank ne sirf apane hisse kii rin suvidha di jo kareeb 3,250 karod rupee baithti he
 This constitutes less than 10 percent of the total credit facility of the alliance in April 2012
 board ne bataaya ki chanda kochar us credit kamity kii sadsy thi, jisane vedeacon group ko lone diya
 He also stated that the consortium of banks had participated in the debt consolidation program of Rs
 40,000 crores of Videocon Group and its subsidiary companies
 isaki pramukhataa esbiai ne kii thi
 ICICI Bank's holding in it was just less than 10 per cent
 isliye uth rahaa sawaldhut or deepak kochar kii kaarobaari saajhedaari or ek duubati company ko ICICI dwaara die gaye karj ko lekar kai gambhir sawaal khadey hote hai
 Videocon investor Arvind Gupta, who has complained in the matter, told India Today, "we want to know why Deepak Kochhar and Dhoot formed a joint venture and why Dhoot got out of it
" gupta ke andeh kaa kaaran NRPL ko usee samay videshi fund kaa bahutayat main milanaa he, jab ICICI bank ne dhoot kii company ko lone die the
 The bank gave loans of around Rs 4000 crore to Videocon Group between 2010 and 2012 and DH Renewables added 325 crore and 66 crore rupees to NRPL in the same period
 jin sawaalon ke abhi nahin mili jawaab?- isiaisiai bank jab videokon samooh ko lone de rahaa tha, to usee samay deepak kochar kii company main baahar se itnaa paisa kyon aa rahaa tha?- videokon ne isiaisiai ko lone ke badale kya guarantee di?- bank ne jab lone manjuur kiya to company kaa credit score kya tha?- kya chanda kochar ne bank board ko apane pati ke saath dhoot ke kaarobaari rishton kii jaankaree di thi?

 Bread, cloth and house are the 3 first needs of human being
 roti ke kuch aise upaay hamen kitabon main milte hai jo aashcharya main daal dete hai
 Come, let's know some such pieces of bread, which can also change our destiny
 1
 After baking the first roti in the kitchen of the house, put pure ghee in it and cut it into four pieces and put kheer or sugar or jaggery on all the four pieces 
 isamen se ek ko gaay ko, duusare ko kute ko, tisare ko kauwe ko or chauthe ko kisi bhikhaari ko de den
 Under this measure, feeding bread to the cow will remove pity, feeding the dog with bread will remove hostility, feeding bread to the crows will remove pityred and kalsarp dosha and feeding the last piece of bread to a poor or hungry person with food is economical
 Troubles will go away and bad things will start to happen
 2
 If Saturn is suffering in your life or if there are obstacles of rahu-ketu, then this remedy of roti can prove to be a panacea for you
 in sabhi grahon kii ashubhta ko dur karne ke liye raat ke samay banaai jane vaali antim roti par sarson kaa tel lagaakar kaale kute ko khaane ke liye den
 If black dog is not available then you can do this remedy by feeding any dog's child
 3
 In our place, the guest is treated like a deity, then he is rich or a common man
 yadi koi nirdhan yaa bhikhaari aapke ghar ke daravaaje par aae to yathasambhav bhojan avashya karaaen
 Must also feed bread in food or serve it manually
 4
 If despite all efforts, success is not being received by you, then this remedy of bread can prove to be a boon for you
 roti or chini ko milakar chote-chote tukade chitiyon ke khaane ke liye unke bill ke aas-paas daalen
 With this remedy your obstacles will start to be overcome gradually
 5
 If the peace of your home has been noticed by someone and fighting is going on every day, then you must try the miraculous remedy related to bread
 dopaher ke samay jab aap apni rasoi main pehali roti senke to use gaay ke liye or antim roti kute ke liye jarur nikaal len
 And try feeding it to the cow and dog before feeding
 yadi yah na sambhav ho to baad main use khilaa den
 6
 agar kariyar main rukaawat he, naukari nahin mil rahi he to yah upaay aapke liye he
 Take the third number bread from the bottom of the bowl, dip your middle finger in the oil bowl and the big finger near the index finger together
 Now draw a line with both fingers on that bread
 ab is roti ko bina kuch bole do rang ke kute ko daal den
 If these measures are done on Thursday or Sunday, then every obstacle in career will be overcome

 par unka kya jinhone puure 59 ghante takapakistanki god main baith kar mumbai ke seene ko chalni kya
 Today, we will not celebrate the mourning of Mumbai on the completion of ten years of 26 / 11
 balki mumbai ke gunahagaaron ko unke taaja pataa-thikaane ke saath aapke saamne rakhenge
 The perpetrator number-1 is Hafiz Saeedwo 26 / 11, the mastermind
 wo pakistan main azaad gum rahaa he or vahaan kaa pradhanmantri banane kaa khwab dekh rahaa he
 There the government makes rhetoric about it, but does not take action against it
 gunahagaar number-2 zaki-ur-rahamaan lakhvi urf chachousane 26 / 11 ke dason aatankiyon ko training di thi
 He was made a terrorist
 2015 main wo pakistani jail se reeha hokar baahar aayaa or ab phir se aatankiyon kii nai khap taiyaar kar rahaa he
 The perpetrator number-3, Zarar Shah, was giving instructions to the terrorists sitting in Karachi on the phone on 26 / 11
 vartmaan main lashkar-e-taiyyaba or iesai ke bich kadi kaa kaam kar rahaa he
 The guilty number 4 David Coleman did Reiki in Mumbai before Headleyhamley and provided intelligence to the terrorists
 hamalon ke baad america court ne use 35 saal kii sazaa sunai or is vakt wo america jail main band he
 The criminal No
5 Zabi-ud-din Ansari alias Abu Hamzaouus gave intelligence information to the terrorists
 bharat main uske khilaaf mukadmaa chal rahaa he
 He has been sentenced to life imprisonment for his crimes
 or wo is vakt bhartiya jail main band he
 What happened ten years ago has passed
 lekin jis gam se mumbai guzari he wo ab bhi uski zindagi kaa hissaa he
 Thousands of eyes that saw Mumbai on 26-11 were constantly in front of you
 ye pehla mauqaa tha jab khule aam chalati gaadi se goliyon kii bauchhaarein huin
 Shells and bullets were fired at railway stations, hospitals and hotels
 lagaataar 59 ghante tak mumbai lahulhan rahi
 It is a pity that it was not a lie, nor is it a lie that even after ten years, the biggest culprits of this massacre are not only free, but even today their poisonous words about India have not diminished
 26 / 11 ke hamale kaa master mind das lakh milian dollar kaa inami aatankwaadi hafiz said he
 The biggest culprit of 26 / 11
 mumbai hamale kaa mastermind
 But absolutely free
 kya kijiega
 He lives in Pakistan
 isliye sab kuch mumkin he
 His freedom too
 baat pichley saal kii he
 The date was 23 November 2017
 puri besharmi ke saath pakistan ne tab hafiz said ko reeha kar diya tha
 After that release, terrorist Hafiz Saeed celebrated his release in Lahore
 darasal janvari 2017 main chautarafa dabaav ke baad pakistani hukumat nesaid ko usee ke ghar main nazarband kar diya tha
 But after 10 months of detention, Hafiz Saeed missed the midnight of 23 November 2017
 or phir subah hote hi wo apane aatanki sanghathan jamaat ud daawa ke headquarter pahunchaa
 Celebration was done by distributing sweets
 kek kaata gaya
 After this, this leader of lashkar-e-taiba started shouting slogans for the destruction of India, which continues unabated till date
 hindustan ke naa jane kitne hi shaharon ke saath shahar mumbai ke is sabase bade dushman ko yun reeha karne kii besharmi sirf pakistan hi kar saktaa tha
 It is the Pakistani government which is still suppressing all the evidence submitted by India against Hafiz Saeed, the biggest accused of 26 / 11
 uske khilaaf court main ek bhi saboot pesh nahin kiya
 However, to show the world that this fraud was required before the court that the release of Hafiz Saeed will increase the difficulties of Pakistan
 isliye use naa choda jaae
 But when the court turned around and asked for evidence against Saeed, the Pak government would have been silent
 janvari 2017 main rihaai ke saath hi pichley das saalon main ye teesraa mauka tha jab pakistan ne hafiz said ko reeha kiya
 He was arrested on two separate occasions due to pressure from India following the 26 / 11 Mumbai attack
 magar donon hi baar kuch dinon baad hi use reeha kar diya gaya
 However, the third and last time he was detained in January 2017 was under house arrest at his home in Johar Town, Lahore
 use jail nahin bheja gaya tha
 This is Uttar Pradesh
 yahaan kuch bhi sambhav he
 Yes, something similar happened with the Uttar Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation (UPSRTC) i
e
 the Chipping Staff of UP Roadways buses
 chanking staff ne ek bas kii checking kii to teen yatriyon ko bina tikat paaya
 In such a situation, action was to be taken against the conductor and driver of the bus
 lekin conductor or dryver ne kuch or hi thaan rakhi thi
 According to the checking stop charge, the conductor instigated the passengers that his job would be lost
 conductor ne karrwai se bachane ke liye pehle checking staff kii gaadi ke aage letne kaa naatak kiya
 If this did not happen, then together with the driver, he took the three members of the checking staff hostage and ran the bus
 phir kai kilometre bas chalane ke baad checking staff ko miti gaanv ke paas utaara
 This incident is from Thana Sadabad area of hathras district
 yahi rashtriya rajmarg-93 (NH-93) par bohare kaa basgaanv ke paas agra ke taj depo kii ek bas ko checking staff ne rukvaaya tha
 There were 70 passengers on the bus
 chacking karne par bas ke 3 yatri bina tikit mili
 Acting on this, the checking staff asked the contractor to sign the manual route after making the ticket without a ticket
 is par conductor ne pehle anakani kii or niyamon ke khilaaf harkaton par utar aayaa
 In this case, against the conductor-driver of the bus, the Road Area Agra Superintendent of Roadways Bhup Singh has filed a report for obstructing government work

 gaiyr-sarkari sanghathan aurat foundation kii ore se taiyaar mahilaon ke khilaaf hinsa kii vashirk report ke anusaar punjab praant main mahilaon ke khilaaf 5492, sindh main 1652, aatankwaad prabhavit khabar pakhtoonkhwaa main 650, baluchistan main 79 or rajdhani islamabad main 127 maamle prakaash main aaye
 The National Convenor of the Mahila Foundation, Rabia Hadi, said the report offers a frightening picture of cases of violence against women
 unhone kaha ki yah report puure desh main samachar patron main prakashit maamalon par aadhaarit he or inamen se adhiktar main praathmiki darj nahin kii gai
 These cases include 1436 murders, 928 murders, 633 suicides and 550 murders of women by members of their own family in the name of false pride
 aaropee deepak talwaar kii patiala house court ne 2 din kii castady badha di he
 For the next 2 days, ED will interrogate Deepak Talwar, but before giving custody, the court rebuked the ED and asked why you need more custody
 pichley 5 dinon main aapane kya kiya bataaen
 Deepak Talwar is in ED custody after his arrest since 31 January
 sunwaayee ke dauraan aaropee deepak talwaar ke vakil ne court se kaha ki sanjay mittal ko kabhi bhi saman nahin mila
 ED sought 2 days more custody of corporate lobbyist Deepak Talwar and said that ED wants to interrogate Sanjay Mittal face to face
 buudhvaar ko rahul khare ko bhi bulaayaa gaya he
 Confront (face-to-face inquiry) is also to be done with them
 60 karod rupye ke bare main or pataa chalaa he jisamen aditya talwaar benifaciari oner he
 Conferences have to be done with them also
 aditya talwaar deepak talwaar ke bete hai
 The ED told the court that along with Deepak Talwar, Aditya Talwar is also the co-owner of the company
 ye paise baahar se ho kar aate hai or jaanch kerani baaki he ki paisa kaise kahaan tak pahunchaa
 However Deepak Talwar's lawyer Tanveer Mir opposed the custody
 vakil kii daleel thi ki 2005-2006 main bharat sarkaar or yuai sarkaar ke bich samjhauta hua
 In 2013, the CBI filed an FIR
 is exiaar main aaropee deepak talwaar ko na aaropee banaaya gaya na chargeshit kiya gaya
 After this, the CBI registered another FIR and the ED started an investigation in the case
 aaropee deepak talwaar dubai main surgery karaane gaya tha
 No investigation has been conducted since 2017 yet
 12 din kii castady ye pehle hi le chuke hai
 Meanwhile, the ED has filed its reply on Deepak Talwar's Hebius Corpus in the Delhi High Court
 idi ne kaha ki court ke aadesh par hi deepak talwaar hamaari castady main he
 So there is no justification for applying Hebius corpus
 lihaaja ise khaarij kiya jaae
 The ED has said in its affidavit filed in the court that Deepak Talwar is doing all these works only to get bail
 idi ne apane halafname main yah bhi kaha he ki deepak talwaar par mani londring se jude behad sangeen aarope hai jisase bhartiya arthvyavastha ko nuksaan jhelana padaa
 The ED said that on January 31, Deepak Talwar was produced before the court within 24 hours of arrest, so no rules have been violated by the agency in his arrest
 pakistan cricket jagat ne bhartiya cricket control board (bisisiai) adhyaksh anuraag thakur ke bayaan ko bakawaas bataate hue kaha ki donon deshon ke bich jab sambandh behatar bhi the tab bhi bharat pakistan ke khilaaf dwipaksheeya siries khilne se batch rahaa tha
 Thakur, one of the top leaders of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in India, said that there was no question of playing cricket from Pakistan
 purv captain mohammad yusuf ne is par pratikriya dete hue kaha, ‚Äòmujhe samaj main nahin aata ki vah kya kahana chaahate hai
 India was avoiding playing bilateral series with us even when relations were better in the last eight years
 ‚Äô pakistan cricket board ne koi aadhikarik bayaan nahin diya he lekin ek sheersh adhikari ne sweekaar kiya ki thakur ke bayaan se ve hairaan hai
 This officer said, 'this is a completely political statement of the BCCI president
 ham niraash hai kyonki bharat ke saath cricket sambandh saamaanya karne ke liye ham lambey samay se kadaa prayaas kar rahe hai or ham hameshaa khel or raajnneeti ko alag rakhane main vishwaas rakhte hai
 Yusuf also said that the International Cricket Council (ICC) should take note of Thakur's statement
 yusuf ne kaha, ‚Äòisisi kahata rahata he ki vah sadsy bordon main raajnneeti yaa sarkari hastkshep ko bardaasht nahin karegaa or bisisiai adhyaksh raajnneetik bayaan de rahe hai ve yaa to bijepi netaa ke rup main bolen yaa phir bisisiai adhyaksh ke rup main
 Former captain Rashid Latif said Thakur's statement does not matter because India has already made it clear that it does not want to play against Pakistan
 latif ne kaha ki kam se kam ab pisibi ko pataa he ki bisisiai se rishton ko lekar vah kahaan khadaa he
 The comments purv test leg spinner abdul kaadir ne kaha ki pakistan ne hameshaa bharat ke saath cricket ko lekar raajnneeti ko dur rakhaa he lekin ab bisisiai aisi sanstha ban gaya he jisamen raajnneetigyon kaa dabadabaa he
 Qadir said, "they have not played with us for years, then what is the meaning of this statement

 Senior off-spinner Harbhajan Singh believes that the real fun is to bowl on a challenging wicket that is not completely spin friendly
 ravichandran aswin ne england ke khilaaf pehle test kii pehali pari main 46 over main 167 ran die or unhen sirf do wicket mili lekin harbhajan ne ise ‚Äòek kharaab din‚Äô qaraar diya

" aapako apni line or length main nirantarata rakhni hogi or vibhinn chijen karne kaa prayaas karnaa hoga
 You have to struggle to get wickets and this will enhance your skills as a bowler
 ‚Äô‚Äô Harbhajan also believes that the England batsmen should be given full credit

 Chinese doctors are using 3D printing for the first time to separate two twin sisters who are related to each other

 tab doctoron ne in bacchiyon ke oparation ke liye teen maheene intjaar karne kii salaah di thi
 BJP has formed a government
 narendra modi ko pradhanmantri bane chah maheene ho gaye hai
 There is no new news in these two facts, but a different thing which emerged during the election has now taken root
 lagata he bijepi ke paas jo he, modi kaa naam hi he
 Brand Modi is overshadowing the brand BJP
 chunaav ke pehle har ek chunavi bhaashan main modi kehete the ki unako vot diya jaae
 If you ask for a vote for another candidate, then in your own name
 unke pradhanmantri banane ke baad bhi yah badla nahin he
 Let's see how
 narendra modi ke pradhanmantri banane ke baad maharashtra, haryana main chunaav hue or philhal jammu-kashmir or jharkhand main chunaav chal rahe hai
 Everywhere, instead of the principles of a local BJP leader or BJP, only one person showed up and tried to assure that person's past governance record and what he can do next
 loksabhaa chunaavon kii hi tarah focus puri tarah se narendra modi par
 Experts also say that the kind of corruption cases that came up during the UPA-2 government created an atmosphere for BJP victory
 lekin agar ye jeet kaa maahaul tha, to bijepi ke baaki netaa iskaa phayda kyon nahin uthaa paae
 Sure he won elections, but could he create a larger than life image like Modi? shaayad isaki vajah modi kaa raajnneetik itihaas or bijepi ke andar kii sthiti bhi rahi
 Whether we believe it right or wrong, the questions raised on Modi after the 2002 Gujarat riots and how Modi's way of dealing with these questions gave him some mental strength
 isi vakt vah daur shuru hua, jisamen modi ne media se duuri banaakar kaam karnaa shuru kiya
 Perhaps this was the time when, without being close to the media, without knowing face to face, he learned how to use the media
 isamen soshal media kaa istemaal jaisaa unhone kiya, shaayad kisi or netaa ne nahin
 The BJP was far behind in the use of this brand building method and Modi was at the forefront
 na to party or na party kaa koi or netaa is tarah kii brand building kar sakaa or na hi logon se dur hote hue bhi logon se mukhaatib hone kaa impressant de paaya
 And in this way Brand Modi became stronger
 gujarat main modi kaa lagaataar jeet darj karnaa ek behad ahm factor rahaa, lekin phir shivaraj singh chouhan or raman singh bhi kya vaise hi daawa kar sakate the, jaise modi ne kiya? shaayad kar sakate the, agar modi jaisi ranneeti apanaate - branding kii or dilli ke halaat kaa phayda uthaane kii
 What was the situation in Delhi? The internal pull in the BJP, which was continuously out of power, had become a matter of fun, being called 'party with a difference', 'party with differences'
 or khinchataan bhi kinake bich thi - barason se rajdhani dilli main baithe ve chehre, jo dilli ke aage dekh to paa rahe the, par rajyon ke kshatrapon ko jagah dene ko taiyaar nahin the
 The days of LK Advani have passed, it was also clear
 
 
 chunaav kaise ladaa jayega, isaki ranneeti se pehle yah nirnay karne kii koshish ho rahi thi ki chunaav jite, to pradhanmantri koun banegaa
 Overall, the situation was such that the party had gone behind and Modi was ahead
 ab jab sarkaar ban chuki he, chah maheene biit chuke hai, sarkaar ke naam par bhi sirf narendra modi hi dikhte hai
 All the ministers are in the background
 khaskar agar videsh mantralay kii baat karen, to sirf pradhanmantri hi dikhte hai, videsh mantri bahut kam
 This is also because Modi makes the smallest thing a 'made for TV' event
 to congress to chhod dijie, abhi bijepi ko modi se kaaphi kuch siikhnaa baaki he
 At the moment, Brand Modi is far ahead of the brand BJP
 ames aspataal ke general ward main paanch saal kii ek anya bacchee kaa bhi ilaaj ho rahaa he

 On Monday, the girl is in such a condition that she can speak
 usne bataaya he ki uski maa use aspataal par chhod kar chali gai thi
 The comments police kaa kahana he ki is bacchee se judi jaankaree kii ek bhi shikaayat kisi bhi thane main darj nahin kii gai he
 Due to this, it is difficult to identify the family of the girl child

 Congress MP Shashi Tharoor, who came under target of some leaders of his own party for openly supporting Jairam Ramesh's statement that Prime Minister Narendra Modi was 'not always treated as a villain', said on Tuesday that he There has been constructive criticism of the government and Congressmen should respect their stand
 kerala congress kii ore se unase spashtikaran maange jane kii khabar saamne aane ke baad tharur ne kaha, ‚Äò‚Äòmain modi sarkaar kaa katu aalochak rahaa hum or main ummid karata hum ki yah rachanaatmak aalochana rahi he
 i have won three elections defending inclusive values and constitutional principles
 main congress ke saathiyon se aagrah karata hum ki mujhe asahmat hone ke baavjood ve mere rukh kaa sammaan karenge
 Earlier, the Kerala unit of the Congress decided to seek an explanation from Thasur (shashi Tharoor) for his remarks in which he said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi should be commended for doing the right things
 kerala pradesh congress cameti (kepisi) ke pramukh mullapalli ramachandran ne kannur main samvaadadaataaon se kaha ki vibhinn party netaaon evam kaaryakartaaon ne unase sampark kar tharur dwaara modi kii saraahna kiye jane kii shikaayat kii he
 He said that he is unaware of the situation in which Thasur (shashi Tharoor) made a comment in support of Modi
 purv mantri ko yah spashtikaran dena chahie ki kis baat ke chalate unhone pradhanmantri ke khilaaf apana purv rukh badal diya
 Actually, the whole matter started with a statement by Congress leader Jairam Ramesh
 ramesh ne gat buudhvaar ek pustak vimochan kaarykram main kaha tha ki pradhanmantri narendra modi ke shashan kaa model 'puri tarah nakaaratmak gaatha' nahin he or unke kaam ke mahatv ko sweekaar nahin karke or har samay unhen khalanaayak kii tarah pesh karke kuch hasil nahin hone vaala he
 Later, leaders like Tharoor and Abhishek Manu Singhvi came out in support of Ramesh's statement and said that the policies and mistakes of the government should be criticized, not the person

 Nair hoped that by March 2018, 100,000 customers of SBI cards would use Rentpay
 bataa den ki esbiai card ne do hajaar yaa usase kam kaa bhugtan check se karne waalon se 100 rupee kaa shulk vasuulana shuru kar diya he
 According to the news of April 19, SBI Card has more than four million customers

 jammu-kashmir main beete 50 saal main sabase zyada tabaahi machaane vaali baadh aane se thik do din pehle ghati main bahane vaali jhelum nadi par bane teen hydrological steshnon ko aane vaale gambhir khatre kaa andeshaa ho chukaa tha
 Less than 50 km from Srinagar is the upstream Sangam station, which is operated by the Central Water Commission (CWC)
 is stesan ne ishaare main bataa diya tha ki 3 sitambar ko yahaan jo jalastr 5
 It was 7 meters, it increased to 10 on 4 September
 13 meter par ja pahunchaa he
 At this stage the first floor of any normal house can be submerged
 khatra teji se bad rahaa tha
 The other two stations of the Commission were soon exposed to the alarmingly rising water level
 rajya kii rajdhani ke najadik sthit ram munshi baag hydrological stesan ne paaya ki 3 or 4 sitambar kii dopaher ke bich jalastr main 3 meter se bhi zyada kii vrudghi hui he
 The data recorded at Safapora station, located slightly downstream, also showed a similar increase in water level during this period (see chart)
 in teenon kendron se teji se badhate jalastr kii khabar milte hi rajya prashasan ko satark ho janaa chahie tha or aane vaali baadh ke gambhir khatre se nibatane ke liye taiyaar ho janaa chahie tha
 Had the state administration been active, it would have got 24 hours to secure the people living in the lower areas, deploy special support teams and supply ration
 lekin aisa kuch bhi nahin hua
 The arguments being made for this inaction are shocking
 kaha ja rahaa he ki ayog ke ye stesan baadh kaa purvanumaan bataane vaale centre thode hi hai
 His task is to monitor the flow of water from India to Pakistan under the Indus River Water Treaty of 1960
 in steshnon ko jab teji se badhate jalastr ke bare main pataa chalaa to unhone fouran sthaneey prashasan ko yah khabar kar di
 But the administration ignored this warning thinking that it had nothing to do with flood management
 ise aapadaa kii sthiti nahin mana gaya or kisi bhi sarkari agency ne is bare main ek-duusare se samparksaadhane kii jarurat hi nahin samajhi
 This development provides a true picture of India's troubled and crumbling disaster management system
 lagbhag 6,000 logon kaa jivan leel lene vaali uttarakhand main ai aakasmik baadh ko salbhar se zyada samay biit chukaa he lekin usase aaj tak sikh nahin lee gai
 The same story was repeated in Kashmir: agencies failed to communicate among themselves, planning arrangements and lacked awareness of the situation
 jidagiyaan bachaane ke ahm kaam ke liye bani yojanaayen lagu karne or unke liye jaruri paisa dene main hilaahvaali kii gai
 The first mistake this time was a severe lack of foresight, despite the fact that Jammu and Kashmir is an unstable and earthquake-prone region
 shaayad isliye kisi ne sochaa hi nahin ki yahaan baadh bhi aa sakati he
 Maps of the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) exclude Jammu and Kashmir in flood-prone areas
 isaki koi vajah bhi nahin bataai gai he, jabaki rashtriya aapadaa prabandhan santhaan ne rajya ko aakasmik baadh kii ashanka vaala kshetra mana he
 Floods have caused havoc in 1992, even bigger disaster came in 1959
 tab bhi rajya main baari tabaahi machi thi
 Confusion about the role of the Central Water Commission starts from here
 ayog ke chairman aswin bi
 According to Pandya, the commission sets up flood forecasting stations only on the request of the state government
 philhal desh main 873 hydrological steshnon main 175 jagahon se baadh kaa purvanumaan jari kiya jaataa he
 Pandya says, "we had not received any such application from Jammu and Kashmir, so our stations located there mainly work for gathering hydrological facts
 ‚Äùin chetavaniyon ke alaava ayog ke steshnon se or bhi mahatvapurn jaankariyaan jutai ja sakati thim
 According to the Meteorological Department, Jammu and Kashmir normally receives 100 mm of rain during the month of September
 lekin maheene ke pehle chaar dinon main hi yahaan 400 mimi barish ho chuki thi
 There was clearly evidence that the danger is knocking
 lekin is baar bhi yahaan aisa koi nahin tha jo in aankadon kaa arth nikaalata or chetavanee jari karata
 By the way, NDMA should have done this work in the grand building of Safdarjung Enclave in New Delhi
 is saal may main, jabase endie sarkaar satta main ai he, endieme ke vaais chairman sahit paanch sadasyon ne istipha de diya he
 At present, the post of the head of this institution is lying vacant
 haalanki sanstha ke saath bhi kai takneekee visheshgy jude hue hai lekin jaisaa ki endieme ke ek adhikari bataate hai, ''sanstha ke netritvviheen hone kaa matlab he ki yahaan maheenon se koi kaam nahin hua he
 "this official told India Today," In general, NDMA continues to receive forecasts from the Meteorological Department and the Central Water Commission
 phir ek team praapt aankadon kaa vishleshan karti he
 Although natural disasters cannot be predicted, it is possible to issue flood warnings in time
 ‚Äùlekin endieme sabhi rajyon ke aapadaa prabandhan main sidhe taur par shaamil nahin he
 Its job is to make policies and provide necessary resources for their implementation
 rajyon main aapadaa prabandhan kaa kaam rajya aapadaa prabandhan praadhikaran or jila aapadaa prabandhan prashasan kaa he, jinke yahaan aise maukon ke liye khaas timen honi chahie jo is tarah kii paristhitiyon se nibatane main sakasham hoti hai
 Here too, both NDMA and the state government failed
 farvari, 2012 main rajya sarkaar ne teen str vaali aapadaa prabandhan niti ko manjuuri di thi lekin aapadaa se nibatane ke liye ek alag vibhaag nahin banaaya gaya
 This work was entrusted to the divisional commissioner or deputy commissioner of the area, who also has many important responsibilities
 abhi pichley saal hi may main kashmir kii chenab ghati bukamp se tharra uthi thi
 However, no steps were taken to implement the disaster management plans
 ise dekhte hue endieme ke tatkaaleen upaadhyaksh shashidhar reddy ne kaha tha, ''kai rajyon ne aapadaa prabandhan kii yojanaayen taiyaar nahin kii hai or jammu-kashmir bhi unamem se ek he
 "subsequently, in the same month, the Chief Secretary of the state, Muhammad Iqbal Khande, said in response that the state has good preparedness and adequate resources to deal with any kind of disaster
 endieme ke adhikariyon kaa tark he ki yah rajyon kaa apana masalaa hota he or aapadaa prabandhan se prabhavi rup se nibatane ke liye zyada se zyada ve rajya par dabaav bhar bana sakate hai
 According to these officials, the state administration is repeatedly asked to follow the procedure
 ek adhikari kehete hai, ''nichle ilaakon ko khaali karana hoga or sari khaadya saamagree ko chhaton par ikattha kiya janaa hoga
 Ration should be provided to the people
 ‚Äùiske alaava kai dirghakaalik sujhav bhi die gaye hai jaise ki satellite phone kaa istemaal karte hue aapadaa sanchaar network sthapit karnaa
 Had this type of system been in place, it would have been very useful in the disaster in Kashmir, where all the normal communication systems had come to a standstill
 endieme ko neshnal dizaster rispance force or neshnal informatics centre kii sahaayta se is tarah kii pranali pichley saal hi taiyaar kar leni thi
 But due to disagreement on various issues of the three agencies, this project was repeatedly stalled
 centre sarkaar ne 2011 main ek prastaav rakhaa tha ki aapadaa kii sthiti se nibatane ke liye 250 karod ru
 Response reserves should be set aside which can be given to the state government in case of disaster
 lekin vitt mantralay ne aapadaa kosh aavantit karne ke prastaav ko har baar naamanzoor kar diya
 More important was the creation of an integrated command system capable of taking critical decisions during a disaster under NDMA
 krishi, raksha or grih mantralay ko is kaman kaa hissaa bananaa tha
 The officials of these ministries also visited Russia to understand the incident response system of Russia
