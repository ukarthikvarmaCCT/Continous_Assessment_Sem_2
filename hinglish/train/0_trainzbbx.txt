 India won the last Test on foreign soil in 2011 in the West Indies
 bharat ne vah shrunkhlaa 1-0 se jiti thi
 Although Dhoni does not believe in living in the past, lessons can be taken from history
 bharat ne is test shrunkhlaa se pehle yahi sochakar rahul dravid ko team kaa menter banaaya tha
 Dravid was part of the team that played a five-test series in 2002
 us samay saurav ganguli kii aguwai vaali bhartiya team ne pehla test jeeta, lekin tisare or paanchaven test ke saath shrunkhlaa haar gai thi
 Like that tour, there is no Test match between any Tests in this series
 40 din kaa yah daura lanbaa he, jisamen bharat ko atmamugdhata ke alaava gendbaajon ko adhik kaarybhaar dene se bhi bachanaa hoga
 On Friday, Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma batted hard
 dhawan or kohli abhi tak koi kamaal nahin kar sake hai, jabaki rohit ko antim ekadash main jagah nahin mili he
 He practiced a lot in the two days before the match, which meant that he could be fielded in this match
 paanchaven gendbaaj kaa chayan bhi pechida hoga
 In the first two Tests, Stuart Binny threw just 20 overs and put both spells in the first innings
 mejabaan ne trentbrij main sirf ek baar ballebaaji kii or lords par binni ne duusari pari main ek over bhi nahin phenkaa
 Dhawan and Murali Vijay were also bowled
 rohit aniyamit spin gendbaaji kar sakate hai or saat ballebaajon ke saath chaar gendbaajon ke formule ko apnaane par unhen utaara ja saktaa he
 The absence of the fifth bowler, however, may indicate that India is now on the defensive
 paanchaven gendbaaj ke rahane se pramukh gendbaajon par maansik dabaav kam hota he
 Jadeja and Binny need 20 overs to give them relief
 bharat ke anubhavheen gendbaajon ne abhi tak england ke adhik anbhavi gendbaajon se behatar pradarshan kiya he
 On the green pitch of Lord's, where James Anderson and Stuart Broad failed, the Indians took full advantage of it
 goa, gunaah or giraftaar
 
 
 Today, in the life of journalist Tarun Tejpal, who created a panic with his news, he created such a panic, which he had put all his strength to avoid
 yon shoshan ke iljaam se ghirne ke baad tejpal kii pehali koshish yahi thi ki wo kisi tarah apni giraftaar se batch jaaen, iske liye goa pahunchane ke saath hi unhone police ke saamne baar-baar pesh hokar apane iraade bhi jataae, lekin adaalat par unki koshishon kaa koi asar nahin hua
 Eventually Tejpal's advance bail application was dismissed and he was arrested
 lekin agrim zamaanat ke liye tarun tejpal kii ye sari sharafat dhari kii dhari rah gai
 After reaching Goa, all these attempts to show themselves to be good in the eyes of the court ultimately proved to be a failure
 or vahi ho gaya, jisase tejpal lagaataar bachane kii koshish kar rahe the
 Here, after a long trial, the court refused to grant advance bail to Tejpal, and the Tejpal was arrested by the Goa Police in the Crime Branch office
 adaalat jahaan ek taraf tarun tejpal par jaanch main sahyog naa karne ke police ke ilzaam se mutmain nazar ai, vahiin duusari taraf vaardaat ke dauraan hotel main kaid unke sisitivi footage or i-mail par tejpal kaa kubulanamaa bhi tejpal kii zamaanat arzi khaarij hone kii ahm vajahon main shaamil rahi
 By the way, the relationship between Tejpal and Goa police in Delhi, it was completely reversed as soon as Tejpal reached Goa
 dilli main goa police tejpal ke peeche bhaag rahi thi, unki talash main chhapemari kar rahi thi, or goa main tejpal police ke peeche bhaag rahe the
 What started the debate on Tejpal's anticipatory bail plea, Tejpal kept going to the police to show his decency and the police now kept a distance from him only to arrest him
 halaat kuch aise hue ki jab adaalat tejpal kii agrim zamaanat arzi par apana faisalaa sunaane vaali thi, tab bhi tejpal usee goa krime branch ke daftar main hi baithe the
 
 
 The Crime Branch wanted to arrest them
 ye tejpal ko apni giraft main lene kii goa police kii vyuh rachana hi thi, jisaki vajah se tejpal ke baar-baar khud chal kar krime branch ke daftar pahunchane ke baavjood goa police ne ek baar bhi unase cese ke mutallik sawaal jawaab nahin kiye
 Rather, for the first time on Friday evening, when Tejpal reached the Crime Branch office after the interim relief from the court, the police got him some legal documents and let him go
 adaalat main police pehle se hi tejpal kii in koshishon ko mukhauta qaraar de rahi thi or to or police ne yahaan tak kaha ki tejpal thik kisi girggit kii tarah apana rang badal rahe hai
 Till yesterday the success of Tejpal sitting on the peak of success and fame was broken by an accusation that even those who did not know Tejpal till now started to know
 balki naa sirf jaanane lag gaye, unki karatuut kii kahani sun kar un par laanat bhi barasaane lage
 It was a situation that a few days ago, the Tejpal who had stepped on the land of Goa like a celebrity, after being accused of the same, when the same Tejpal reached Goa, black flags and banners started doing him well
 
 
 
 or to or ye silsilaa duusare din bhi jari rahaa
 But after the court's decision on the episode of arrest of Tejpal, which has been going on for the last several days, finally got fullstop
 mehmaan kii tarah police ke paas pesh hote chale gaye tejpalatakareeban das dinon se jo tarun tejpal jamaane ko dhunde nahin mil rahe the
 The same Tarun Tejpal once appeared, then went on presenting himself to the police like an uninvited guest
 haalat ye ho gai ki goa pahunchane ke baad abhi police ne unhen ek baar bhi poochtacha ke liye nahin bulaayaa, lekin tejpal the ki mahaz chand ghanton ke dauraan do-do baar krime branch ke daftar main haazir ho liye
 Tejpal did not know how much respect was hidden for the law in this exercise, but if the experts of the law believed that his efforts were necessary to give the impression before the police and the court that he was very pro-active in cooperating in the investigation
 are doing
 police or bachaav paksh kii baheswaise din dhalate-dhalate unki is kavayad kaa nateeja bhi saamne aa gaya
 But before this, the debate between the police and the defense about Tejpal's advance bail was also worth hearing
 tejpal ke vakeelon ne apane muvakkil ke liye adaalat ke dil main raham paidaa karne kii har koshish kii
 While giving the assurance of cooperation in the investigation, it also said that Tejpal will not leave Goa unless the DIG wants him and he will do so until the police does not file a charge sheet against him or else a closure report is filed in this case
 court main arji manjuur karwaane kii har sambhav koshishasubah se kai kishton main hui bahes ke dauraan tejpal ke vakeelon ne unka passport yahaan tak kii epady samet rupye-paise se jude duusare dastauez hi adaalat ko saunpane kii peshkash kii or kaha ki jab tak unke muvakkil itnaa aage bad kar police ko jaanch main sahyog kar rahe hai, to phir unhen giraftaar karnaa zaruri nahin he
 The defense even said that being accused of rape does not mean being guilty
 lekin ye maahaul madhya yug kii yaad dilaataa he
 Tejpal himself is one of the Muslim people and has always stood for the rights of human rights, so it is necessary to arrest him for questioning
 lekin bich main in daleelon kaa asar bhi ulta padane laga
 In fact, Tejpal's lawyers also questioned the girl complaining against him, saying, why did she complain about the case after so many days? However, the police wind up all the defense arguments by seeking judicial custody of Tejpal for 14 days
 Blew in police ne kaha tha ki tejpal jaanch main sahyog nahin, balki dikhaava kar rahe hai
 If they had to cooperate, why did they not come before the police in Delhi? Tejpal appeared only when he got interim relief from the court
 police ne ye bhi yaad dilaayaa ki ye tejpal hi the, jinhone daftar main mail kar ladki se maafee maangi thi
 And now they are arguing for advance bail as if the trial of the case is going on
 zaahir he, jis maamle main mahaj agrim zamaanat ke liye itani jabardast kanoonee khinchataan chal rahi ho, vahaan mukademe main abhi or bhi pench-o-kham kaa aana tay he

 Fueled by this strong fall, the Chinese government hurriedly closed down the market, taking a number of drastic steps to stop the selling of shares and banned the sale of shares of many companies

 In such a situation, the training of 40,000 soldiers and the inspector as a jugaad was done in different stages in a hurry which was of no use
 '' shaayad yahi vajah he ki pichley ek-do varshon main police ke duvryavhaar kii zyaadaatar vaaradaaten 2015-16 batch ke pulicekarmiyon se judi hai

 "the experiments did not change the appearance of Surat
 After assuming power last year, Chief Minister Yogi claimed to change the appearance of the police department
" amuman sarkaar ke badalte hi purvavarti sarkaar main tainaat dijipi or pramukh sachiv grih ko fouran badal diya jaataa tha
 Yogi made the first experiment that Javid Ahmed, who was posted in the previous SP government, retained DGP for more than a month
 aisi hi dariyaadilii purv pramukh sachiv grih devashish pandas ke saath bhi dikhaai gai jo do maheene tak apane pad par kabiz rahe
 After this, in May last year, under a new arrangement, the deployment of officers of Additional Director General of Police (ADG) level and Inspector General of Police (IG) level in the range started
 par police kii karypranali badalane main yah vyavastha bhi kargar sabit nahin hui
 "ADG, law and order is an important post after DGP," says a police officer posted in the director general's office

 There was curiosity about whether Sidhu comes to the meeting or not
 lekin sthaneey nikaay mantri siddhu cabinet baithak main nahin pahunche hai
 Earlier, Sidhu did not even attend the meeting called by Chief Minister Captain Amarinder to review the election results and Navjot Sidhu did not attend the meeting this time too
 cabinet kii baithak main sthaneey nikaay vibhaag kaa koi agenda shaamil nahin tha
 So there was skepticism when Sidhu joined the meeting
 ashanka jataai ja rahi thi ki siddhu agar baithak main hissaa nahin lete hai to unki pareshaaniyaan or bad sakati he
 But Sidhu did not attend the meeting
 isse pehle bhi 30 may ko mukhyamantri ne baithak bulaai thi
 Sidhu did not attend this meeting of Congress mlas and mps
 jise mukhyamantri ne behad gambhirtha se liya tha
 Then Amarinder Singh had also ascertained whether a message was sent to Sidhu to attend the meeting
 siddhu mukhyamantri ke kareebi mantriyon ke nishane par hai
 The special thing is that Captain Amarinder has prepared to take the local body department from Sidhu

 itnaa hi nahin rajya ke kai mantriyon ne yahaan tak kah diya ki agar siddhu captain ke netritv main kaam nahin kar sakate to istipha de den
 According to sources, Amarinder Singh has made it clear to the party leadership that due to Navjot Singh Sidhu, the party has suffered a lot in Punjab as well as other states
 ab party ko siddhu ke bare main sochna hoga
 Significantly, before the elections, Sidhu's wife Navjot Kaur had said that if the Congress party does not win all the seats in Punjab, then Chief Minister Amarinder Singh should resign

 ''tanushri datta ne likhaa- ''hamen pataa chalaa he ki naanaa patekar kii piaar team ne is tarah kii juthi khabaren failaai hai

 america kii chetavanee ke baavjoodbharatane aakhirkaar rus sees-400vaayu raksha pranali kharidne ke liye paanch arab dollar ke samjhaute par shuukravaar ko hastakshar kiye
 There was talk between India and Russia about the deal of this missile system since 2015
 kai desh rus se yah system khareednaa chaahate hai kyonki ise america ke thad (terminal hai altitude aria dephence) system se behatar mana jaataa he
 The surprising thing is that this big agreement between the two countries was not even mentioned by the leaders of the two countries in their press talks
 es-400 banane vaali company ke saath reliance kii he dilsaal 2015 main pradhanmantri narendra modi kii masco yatra ke daurathonil ambaniki company reliance dephence ne rus ke almaj-anti ke saath 6 arab dollar ke sambhavit vinirmaan or rakh-rakhaav saude par hastakshar kiye the
 Explain that almaz-anti is a subsidiary of Rosoboronexport and a major manufacturer of S-400
 24 disambar 2015 koreliance infrastracchar limitedne apni ek press relies main iskaa zikr kiya tha
 It wrote that the DAC approved the acquisition of the S-400 air defense missile system with a $ 6 billion business opportunity
 bharat kii reliance dephence limited or rus kii vaayu raksha missile system kii pramukh nirmaataa company almaj-anti ne bharat ke saath sanyukt rup se kaam karne kaa faisla kiya he
 According to the information, Chairman of Reliance Group Anil said in the press release that our proposed partnership will prove to be a milestone for the strategic relationship between the two countries
 vahiin almaj-anti ke upaadhyaksh ne kaha tha ki reliance dephence ke saath kaam karne se bhavishya main bharat kii suraksha balon kii jaruraton ko puraa karne ke liye donon companiyon ko nai disha milegi
 Let us know that due to the name of Reliance Industries in this deal, the problems of Modi government can increase
 kyonki rafel mudde par rilanyas kaa naam aane ke baad se vipaksh lagaataar modi sarkaar ko gher rahaa he
 At the same time, if the name of Reliance in the indo-russian deal, the opposition can also make it an issue
 gauratlab he ki france ke purv raashtrapati francwa oland ne france kii ek magazine ko die intervyuu main oland ne ye khulaasa kiya tha ki rafel saude ke liye bharat sarkaar ne anil ambani kii reliance kaa naam prastaavit kiya tha or Dassault Aviation ke paas reliance ke saath qaraar karne ke alaava koi doosraa opshan nahin tha
 America can impose banamerica has been threatening to ban any kind of defense purchases from Russia
 america ne kaha he ki rus ke saath bharat kii yah deal unkeshchhathshasection 231 ke tahat aati he jiske chalate is deal par vah bain laga saktaa he
 In fact, the US has banned any kind of defense procurement from Russia through the Countering America's Advisory Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA)
 haalanki isse pehle america ne is deal par naram tevar dikhaate hue kaha tha ki rus par pratibandh ko lagu karne kaa makasad apane sahyogiyon or partneron kii sainya kshamtaaon ko damege karnaa nahin he
 We cannot prejudice any kind of restriction
 paison ke bhugtan ke tareeke par bhi ho rahi charchapaison ke bhugtan ke tareeke par ho rahaa vichaar he
 Both countries want the money to be paid on this deal in such a way that America cannot ban any kind of it
 bhugtan aisa hona chahie jisase arthvyavastha, vyapaar or suraksha bina kisi rukaawat or pareshaani ke chalata rahe
 Actually the manufacturer company almaz-anti is on the list of American sanctions, due to which it has been banned on banking transactions
 is deal ko lekar bharat ko bhale hi america kii taraf se riyaayat mil jaae lekin company par laga bain is deal ke aade aa saktaa he
 India, the third country to get the S-400 - India will be the third country in the world to have this missile system after the S-400 deal with Russia
 iske pehle china or turki ke saath rus yah deal kar chukaa he
 - The matter is also being discussed with Saudi Arabia for the purchase of this missile system
 -is deal ko lekar pakistan kaaphi chintit he
 Recently, the information minister Fawad Chaudhary described this deal with Russia as a big problem
 choudhary ne kaha, 'bharat apni shaktiyon kaa istemaal pakistan ke khilaaf kar rahaa he
 Russia has good relations with India but Pakistan is also getting closer to Russia
 isliye rus ko keval bharat ke saath hi yah deal daanv par nahin lagaani chahie

 In the first term of the Modi government, he was given the responsibility of the Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (independent Charge)
 calraj mishra uttar pradesh ke devaria loksabhaa seat se chunaav jite the
 However, Kalraj Mishra was later taken the ministerial position
 is baar kaa loksabhaa chunaav unhone nahin ladaa tha
 Kalraj Mishra has been the state president of BJP in the years 1991, 1993, 1995 and 2000

 (input bhashaa se) Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot last Tuesday created a dinosaur with a white elephant as part of his cabinet reshuffle
 guuruuvaar ko jab unhone mantriyon ko vibhaagon kaa bantwaaraa kiya to yah saaf ho gaya ki congress netaa maahir aaazaad ne sarkaar ke bare main jo taaja bayaan diya tha, usamen ratti bhar koi badlaav nahin hua he
 Azad had recently said in Jhalawar that "the government has been sleeping for the last three years
" ''gahalot ne pehle apane sabhi mantriyon or sansadeey sachivon se istipha likhvaya
 He did this trick in collusion with Minister Shanti Dhariwal
 pehle dhariwal ne hi istipha diya, jaise yah bataa rahe hon ki gahalot ke netritv main unhen kitna vishwaas he
 But in the true sense, this hawkish exercise of Gehlot became a good joke
 logon ne ise apni galtiyaan chhipaane kii gahalot kii ek or yukti bataaya
 After removing five ministers, he made another joke by making six new ministers and seven more parliamentary secretaries
 ab inaki sankhya 40 ho gai he yani 30 kii sanvaidhanik seemaa se 10 zyada
 During the last BJP government, when the six parliamentary secretaries were appointed, the same Congress told him to fly the flag of constitutional dignity
 kaha gaya ki sansadeey sachiv mantriyon ke baraabar pahunch gaye
 Now why did Gehlot start wasting public money on them? As far as major changes are concerned, Gehlot has blamed Dhariwal for indirectly firing at the dry fruits' A
 He has taken home department himself
 yani dhariwal vaali jimmedaari uthaa paane kii kuwwat or kisi mantri main nahin
 It can also be a trick to pacify Dhariwal
 ab dekhnaa he ki gahalot grih mahakama kab tak lekar chalate hai kyonki ve kisi bade vivaad main padana nahin chahenge
 Despite rotting garbage and pothole roads in cities, Dhariwal will continue to be the Minister for Urban Development and Housing

 Rural Development and Panchayat Minister Bharat Singh was doing a good job
 so unhen lok nirmaan vibhaag main bhej diya gaya, jo bhrashtachar ke liye kukhyat he
 Pramod Jain Bhaya was given the independent charge of this department for three years in exchange for a strong fight with opposition leader Vasundhara Raje and his son Dushyant in Jhalawar area
 un par bhrashtachar ke gambhir aarope lag hai
 He is no longer a minister
 bhrashtachar ke sabase zyada aaropon ke bich rahane vaale babulal nagar kaa bal bhi baankaa na hua kyonki gahalot unhen laad karte hai
 Bina Kak, Parasadilal Meena, Rajendra Pareek and Mahendrajeet Malviya have been given additional charges
 malviya ko gramin vikaas mila he
 They could not do anything in the tribal area, what will they do here? Gehlot has said that they will expand further
 ab jab media is par kayaas lagayegaa to ve us par asthirataa failaane kaa aarope madhenge
 And they are moving towards instability

 Raghu Sharma is pained that he was capable of becoming a minister rather than chief whip
 gahalot apane logon ko lakh nikammepan ke baavjood nahin hataate
 The party high command has given him freedom, knowing that after being the chief minister from 1998 to 2003, Gehlot had brought the party's MLA number to one-third

 iske alaava pichley match main mohammad shami kii jagah lene vaale mohit sharma ko utaara jaae yaa nahin
 Despite being an aggressive batsman, Dhawan could not do much in the tournament, replacing Rahane
 yuvaraj yadi puri tarah se feet nahin hote hai to rahane or dhawan donon ko antim ekadash main shaamil kiya ja saktaa he
 Captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni would be praying that Yuvraj should be fit in time as his spin bowling also proves to be very useful

 Dhawan scored 31 runs in three matches
 westeindies or bangladesh ke khilaaf vah bahut kharaab khele
 He first gets on the field in the practice session, but is unable to walk in the match
 ab dhoni ko tay karnaa hoga ki rohit sharma ke saath pari kii shuruyaat dhawan karenge yaa rahane
 The selection of Bhuvneshwar Kumar's partner in fast bowling is also a matter of concern
 bhubaneshwar ne 12 overon main 4

 6
 The Supreme Court said that if the DSP is confident that after convincing they will not agree, then inform the SDM, SP so that Section 144 can be imposed in time and arrest can be made under Section 151
 7

 com / pkyhetvcls bharat ne aaj dakshes shikhar vaarta se itar nepal main pradhanmantri narendra modi or unke pakistani samakaksh navaj sharif ke bich mulaakaat kii sambhaavna se inkaar nahin kiya
 In this regard, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj said, 'wait till tomorrow
 ' Sushma Swaraj, who arrived here today to attend the eighteenth SAARC summit, said that she is happy to come to Nepal only three and a half months after her first bilateral visit in July
 pradhanmantri modi or sharif ke bich mulaakaat kii sambhaavna ke bare main puche jane par sushamaa ne kaha, 'kal tak intjaar kiijie
 In response to the question of bilateral meeting outside SAARC, Sharif's Foreign and National Security Affairs Advisor Sartaj Aziz said, "look, i think one or two (meetings) are set
" anya abhi tay nahin hai
 ' modi-sharif mulaakaat kii sambhaavna par unhone kaha, 'ab tak koi yojana nahin he
 Asked more, Aziz said, 'if there is initiative from the other side (for the meeting)
 ' sushamaa se sambhavit mulaakaat par ajij ne kaha, 'dekhie, agar vah aagrah karti hai, to main (mulaakaat) karuunga
 ' yah puche jane par ki kya shikhar vaarta bharat-paak rishton ke saaye main hogi, ajij ne kaha, 'mujhe aashaa he ki nahin
 SAARC is more important
 
 ' sushamaa or ajij ke bayaan aise samay aae hai jab pakistani media ne khabar di thi ki donon deshon ke pradhanmantri buudhvaar ko dakshes shikhar vaarta ke itar mulaakaat kar sakate hai
 The Express Tribune, quoting an official, reported, "the two Prime Ministers will face each other during the 'retreat Ceremony' in Kathmandu
" ' parampara ke anusaar, dakshes shikhar vaarta main shaamil hone vaale rashtron or sarkaron ke pramukhon ko dwipaksheeya baithkon ke liye acha maahaul banane ke liye sammelan ke udghaatan ke baad 'retreat' (saiyr sapate) ke liye le jaaya jaataa he
 Significantly, India canceled the foreign secretary-level talks with the neighboring country after Pakistani High Commissioner Abdul Basit held talks with Kashmiri separatists in August
 south emsidi ke parshadon ko jald hi bade hue bhatton kaa tohfa milane vaala he
 a resolution in this regard was presented in the House meeting on Tuesday, which has also been passed in the House
 darasal bijepi parshad or sadan kii netaa ke liye namankit shikha raay ne prastaav rakhaa tha ki sadan kii baithkon main bhaag lene ke liye parshadon ko mahaz 300 rupye prati baithak bhatta miltaa he jo masik 3 hazaar rupye baithta he
 This allowance is inadequate at the present time, because more than this is spent in the movement of councilors and keeping this in mind, the councilors should get increased allowance
 isi ko dhyaan main rakhte hue ab parshadon ko prati baithak 1 hazaar rupye bhatta dene kaa prastaav sadan main pesh kiya gaya
 Apart from this, a proposal for other allowances was also introduced in the House today
 prastaav ke mutabik ab har parshad ko maheene ke 10 hazaar rupye bataur offis ke kharche ke taur par milenge to vahiin meyar, dipti meyar, netaa sadan, sthaayee samiti adhyaksh or netaa vipaksh ke liye ye rakam 15 hazaar rupee tay kii gai he
 Apart from this, an allowance of Rs
 1000 per meeting will also be given to all 104 councilors
 prastaav ke mutabik ab parshadon ko steshnari ke liye 6 hazaar rupee pratimah die jaaenge, to vahiin computer oparator or milane aane vaale logon ke jalpan ke liye 5-5 hazaar rupee die jaaenge
 Support of Aam Aadmi Party too! Jarnail Singh, MLA from Aam Aadmi Party was also present in the House on Tuesday
 unhone bhi prastaav kaa samarthan kiya or kaha ki parshadon ko bhi bhatta milanaa chahie
 However, he said that the Rs 5000 received by the computer operator was insufficient and said that it should be increased to Rs 14 thousand
 philhal prastaav ko manjuuri ke liye dilli sarkaar ke paas bheja jayega

 Obviously, if the shooting of the film is over
 to iske post production kaa kaam bhi shuru ho chukaa hoga
 Let me tell you, Salman Khan's 'bharat' is directed by Ali Abbas Zafar and he is also his favorite director, both have also been giving superhit films

 Please give a couple of tweets to the bjp-congress on Twitter that as the Karnataka elections are approaching, the attacks between BJP and Congress on Twitter are constantly increasing
 donon partiyaan ek duusare ke twit par jamkar palatwaar kar rahi hai
 Earlier, a tweet by BJP giving information about Prime Minister Modi's visit to Karnataka went viral, on which social media users also took a dig
 bijepi ne modi ke daure kii jaankaree game of throns ke kirdaar ned stork kii ek photo twit kar di thi, us par likhaa tha, 'apane aapako sanbhaalo congress, modi aa rahaa he

 jahaan ek ore sachin ke aakhri test match par desh videsh ke logon kii nigahen tiki hui hai, vahiin desi or videshi sattebaajon kii nigahen bhi sachin ke aakhri donon test maichon par tiki hui hai
 Actually the speculative market wants to capitalize on this opportunity
 sachin kii har harakat par satorion kii paini najar he
 This is the reason that the speculation of around 1600 crores is being imposed only on Sachin
 aisa satta bazaar ke itihaas main pehali baar ho rahaa he ki kisi ek khilaadi par itnaa paisa lag rahaa ho
 How many runs will Sachin Tendulkar score, how many balls will be played, how many wickets will be taken, stumped out, or clean bowled or caught out
 sachin kii har harakat par lagegaa satta
 According to the bookies, if Sachin scores 25, then there will be a price of 12 paise, Sachin will score 50, then there will be a price of 18 paise, on Sachin's century, there will be a rate of 1 rupee 40 paise, if Sachin crosses the 200 mark
 If there is a price of 4 rupees
 sachin kis tarah out honge usapar bhi jamkar satta lagane vaala he
 For example, if Sachin is caught out then there will be a price of 38 paise, if he is clean bold, then there will be a price of 16 paise, if LBW is out, it will cost 54 paise
 vahiin sachin in donon maicho main paanch wicket lene main kaamyaab honge to 1 rupee 10 paise kaa bhav hoga
 Significantly, the bookies are betting on how many runs, centuries or double centuries Sachin can make
 sattebaajon kii najar sachin kii antim chaar pariyon par tiki hui he
 Sachin is also playing in the Test match which started on 6 November at Eden Gardens
 yah sachin kaa 199waan test match he
 The final Test match will be played by Sachin from 14 November to 18 November at Wankhede, Mumbai
 muqabla westeindies kii team se he or sabhi maan rahe hai ki match india ke paksh main hoga
 Mumbai, Jaipur, Jodhpur, Bikaner, Nagpur, Indore, Delhi, Kanpur as well as abroad have been betting on Sachin's innings
 aisa maahaul tab he jab mumbai or dilli police satorion ke peeche haath dhokar padi hui he
 But if the bookies believe it did not have much effect and the bookies have become smarter than before
 police kii paini najar ke chalate satorion ne apane is dhandhe ko chalaane ke liye nayaa tarika apana liya he
 First deposit money and then you can get into this field, this is the new trick of the bookies to bluff the police
 agar aapako sachin par satta lagaana he to aapako ek acount number diya jayega, jisamen aap jitna paisa diposit karenge utane kaa hi aap khel paaenge
 As soon as your money will be deposited in the book of the bookmaker, the bookmaker will give you the number of his punter, only then you will join the game
 satorie jis number ko ek baar istemaal karte hai, use dobaaraa phir istemaal main nahin laate
 But the Mumbai Police claims that they have a sharp eye on the bookies and are doing their best to stop it
 mumbai krime branch ke joint police kamishnar ne bataaya, 'ipl ke dauraan hamane satorion par kadi nigaah rakhi thi or is baar bhi ham sajag hai
 Whatever be the condition of the betting market, but the whole country is eyeing them to bid farewell to 'god'
 sachin ke naam par vaise to kai record hai lekin is baar ek nayaa record intazaar kar rahaa he
 The highest betting record on any single player
 jaankaron kii maane to sachin ke upar ab tak ke itihaas main sabase bada satta lagegaa
 The world is eyeing Sachin and the bookies around the world are eyeing every action of Sachin

 is sambandh main umr abdulla banaam rahul gandhi jaisaa kuch bhi nahin he

 Significantly, the NTJ, whose name the police chief has taken on his alert, is a radical Muslim organization
 pichley saal bhi yah sanghathan surkhiyon main aayaa tha jab vahaan kuch buddha dharmasthalon par hamalaa kiya gaya tha
 If such an attack happened after the police chief's alert, then it is a matter of concern for the Sri Lankan administration
 agar samay rahete police pramukh ke alert par karrwai hoti to aaj sainkadon logon kii jaan nahin jaati or srilanka dhoomdhaam se easter manaa rahaa hota
 The attack on three churches and three hotels, according to the police, targeted St

 The Noida district administration has issued an odd-poor circular for schools
 is circular main kaha gaya he ki skool jila prashasan ko aapraadhik pravriti vaale chaatro kii gopneey suchi bhejein
 Both this school and parents of the district administration are shocked
 skulon ke mutabik aapraadhik pravriti ke chaatro ko pahchaanane kaa mechanism naa to skulon ke paas he or naa hi skool aisa koi mechanism viksit karnaa chaahate hai
 According to Dr
 Upma Arora, Principal of JBM Global School, the district administration should tell itself how to identify children of criminal tendency to school
 kyonki skulon kaa kaam bacchon ko riform karnaa he
 Even if children are going in the wrong direction, the school cannot spoil its future by giving its children the status of a student of criminal tendency
 dow upama ke mutabik hamaskulon main bacchonko couseling dene ke saath-saath vailu adishan seshan, spiritual seshan, anger management jaise seshan dete rahete hai
 So that if children are under any kind of stress or depression, they get help
 skulon kii koshish hoti he ki bacchon main aapraadhik pravriti paidaa hi naa ho
 In such a situation, it is not at all appropriate to call a child criminal through this circular
 ek nami skool ne naam na chhapane kii shart par ajtak se kaha ki unhen jila prashasan kaa circular mila he
 But they are confused about this circular
 skool ke mutabik ye samajhnaa mushkil he ki aapraadhik pravriti kii shrenee main kin bacchon ko rakhaa jaae
 Teachers usually keep an eye on the activities of each of their students in schools
 aise chaatr jinke bartaav dusron se alag hota he yaa kharaab hota he, unki jaankaree mata-pita ko di jaati he, taaki chaatr kii asal samasya tak pahunchaa ja sake
 Many times there are fights between the students, which the students resolve among themselves
 kuch chaatr adhik uttejit ho jate hai
 Such students are given better counseling within the confines of the school
 lekin kya aisi harakatein karne vaale chaatro ko aapraadhik pravriti ke chaatro kii shrenee main rakhaa janaa chahie? bilkul nahin
 The school's job is to develop the personality of the students while solving their problems
 naa ki unhen aapraadhik pravriti kaa chaatr qaraar dekar soochibaddh kar dena
 When Aaj Tak talked to the parent association about this circular, he was also seen in a hurry
 abhibhavakon ne aise circular ko gairajaruri bataate hue sidhaa jila prashasan se hi sawaal puch daalaa
 The parents asked that the district administration explain what the criminal propensity standard is? Is there any way of recognizing the increasing criminal tendency among school children and if a child has such tendency, would it be right to give him the status of a student of criminal tendency like the named criminal
 gopneey suchi ke baavjood kya bachche ke bhavishya par is suchi kaa asar nahin padegaa
 Listing some children from among thousands of children of the school as criminal students will not affect the mental condition of the students
 manovaigyanik dow puja sivam jetali kii maane to badalte samay ke saath bacchon ke andar aapraadhik pravriti bad rahi he, lekin iskaa ye matlab katai nahin he ki bacchon ko chinhit kiya jaae or unhen aapraadhik darja diya jaae
 Dr
 Jaitley said that this circular needs to be accurately interpreted
 mata-pita samet skulon ko chahie ki wo apane bacchon kii gatividhiyon par najar rakhen or agar baccha kaa bartaav nakaaratmak or aakraamak najar aae, to aise bacchon par khaas dhyaan diya jaae
 Such students are sensitive
 lihaaja inhen alag-thalag karne kii bajaay inhen saamaanya chaatr ke rup main hi sakaaratm disha dikhaane kii jarurat he
 In such a case, in addition to the counselor of the school, the help of a professional counselor can be taken
 bhartiya janata party kii varisht netaa nirmala sitaraman ne congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi par sanshodhit naagarikta kanoon ko lekar logon ko ''bhramit'' karne or NRC ke saath isaki ''galat tareeke se'' tulana karne kaa aarope lagaate hue unki aalochana kii
 In a statement issued by the Bharatiya Janata Party, Sitharaman asked the protesters to read this law and seek clarification on the need
 unhone pradarshnakariyon se yah bhi kaha ki vah aisi takaton se bachein jo unhen ''bhramit'' kar rahe hai or desh ke nagarikon ke bich ''hinsa or dar failaa rahe hai
 "sitharaman said," i appeal to all the citizens of India not to fall into this confusion and fear
 congress or trinmul or aap jaisi partiyaan or vam dal sanshodhit naagarikta kanoon evam NRC ko aapas main jod kar dar paidaa kar rahe hai, jabaki enarasi abtak taiyaar bhi nahin hua he
 "I appeal to every citizen of the country not to be influenced by what the frustrated Congress, TC, AAP and Left parties are doing," he said
 ''bhaajapa netaa ne kaha ki sanshodhit naagarikta kanoon kisi bhi bhartiya kii naagarikta chhinane ke liye nahin he
 He stressed that this law has nothing to do with any Indian citizen
 unhone kaha, ''yah durbhagyapurna he ki congress party kii antarim adhyaksh sonia gandhi sanshodhit naagarikta kanoon ko lekar desh ke logon ko bhramit kar rahi hai or galat tareeke se ise NRC se jod rahi hai jabaki enarasi abtak taiyaar bhi nahin kiya gaya he

 According to Chappell, in that era, when other batsmen rely on their technique, Sehwag follows the tried formula of 'look at the ball and hit'

 We should adopt new technology, but we also need to see if all the students are capable of adopting it or not

 In the Howdy Modi program, the leaders of modi-trump gave a one-hour speech after the speech
 After the speech, the round of the field has been in the foreign policy of Prime Minister Narendra Modi many times since 2014

 PM Modi emphasized personal touch with the heads of state in the opposition policy

 ab yun to donald trump ko puri duniya hi jaanati he lekin phir bhi modi ne apane andaaj main unka parichay karavaaya
 The Prime Minister would repeatedly make hand gestures, hand to Donald Trump and then look at the crowd
 janata ke saath samvaad ke maamle main har koi narendra modi kaa kaayal he, yahaan tak ki vipakshi netaa bhi isaki tarif karte hai ki narendra modi ek shandaar vaktaa hai
 This was seen in Houston when the PM directly interacted with more than 50,000 people sitting in the stadium

 Modi came down from the stage, reached directly to Donald Trump and met him and moved towards the audience
 piem modi ne donald trump kaa haath pakadaa or unase kaha ki chaliye, maidan kaa chakkar lagaate hai
 Perhaps even Donald Trump was not ready for this nor did the security personnel deployed under him
 lekin modi aage bade or donald trump ke saath maidan kaa chakkar kaatane lage, donon netaaon ne stadium main baithi janata kaa abhivadan sweekaar kiya

 Such an event that breaks like a holocaust causes lightning to run through the nerves of any reporter
 us samay bhale hi main dilli main da statsman kaa sampadak hua karata tha, lekin dil se to ek reporter hi tha
 Obviously, there was a lot to do that morning
 ek vishesh supplement nikaalane ke liye saare jaruri staff ke saath baithna tha
 Reporters were supposed to share their work
 iske alaava printing vibhaag or kolkata (tab kalakatta) main akhbaar ke sampadak en
 J
 nanpuria ke saath baat bhi kerani thi
 The staff was fully active and our supplement was ready
 lekin tab tak press par puri tarah bandish laga di gai
 We had to send to the newspaper censors
 lautakar aane par isamen dher saare shabd kaali syaahi se kaate hue the
 The word 'alleged' was removed from the title 'conspiracy to and Democracy Knowledge'
 iske alaava jaiprakash narayan ke bare main khabar 'jepi amang meni held under misa' or 'piples ritis wailated, sej raaj narayan' ko puri tarah hataa diya gaya

 The next morning, The Statesman announced on its very first page: 'this version of The Statesman is censored
 ' shukla ne is par nirdesh diya ki aisa karne kii ijaajat nahin he
 One day in January 1976, i was called to meet him
 unhone mulaakaat main pichley din ke akhbaar ke liye fatkaaraa, jisamen pehle panne par videsh kii khabaren thim jabaki rajyasabha main immergency vidheyak paarit hone par choti-si khabar thi
 Shukla did not like my answer
 maine unase bas itnaa hi kaha tha ki ve mujhe yah to bataa sakate hai ki kya nahin chhapana he, lekin yah nahin bataa sakate ki kya chhapana he or kaise chhapana he
 He said to me that he would not talk to me again on this issue
 aaj puraani baton ko yadakar aisa lag saktaa he ki indira gandhi sarkaar kii kuch harakatein haasyaaspad thim
 The Chief Press Officer of the government came to me to tell me that i should print the photographs of Prime Minister and Congress President Devakant Barua on the front page
 barua tab ek lahim-shaheem khushmijaaj-se shaks hua karte the, jinhen cuban cigar kaa shauk tha
 He himself coined this slogan in devotion to Indira Gandhi, "india is Indira, Indira is India
" '' immergency ke dauraan meri unase bas ek baar mulaakaat hui thi, jab unhone immergency se pehle un par likhe mere ek lekh ke liye meri khinchaai kii thi
 i used to wonder how people who do politics change with time
 yah baat sirf netaaon tak hi simit nahin thi
 Media is also an equal offender in this
 laalkrishna adwani kaa vah yaadgaar uddhran iskaa gavaah he, ''aapako (media ko) jhukne ke liye kaha gaya tha, lekin aap rengne lage
 "in The Statesman, we tried to dodge the censors intellectually
" sensor main baithe ek ausat shaks ke mukaable chunki hamaare staff kii angreji bahut acchhee thi, lihaaja ham apni asahmatiyon ko jaahir karne ke liye dwiarthi vaakyon kaa prayog karte the or apekshaakrit halke tisare sampadakeey ko sahaara banaate the

 Gradually, the barbarity of Emergency began to fall
 press note main ab kam badlaav kiye jane lage, parivaar niyojan yaa naagarik lakshyon ko puraa karne ke dabaav bhi kam hone lage
 The Indian psyche is not very exploratory in finding new ways of repression
 immergency ke 20 maheenon se hamane kya siikhaa? vidambnaa dekhie, aisa lagata he ki adwani kaa rajnatik kariyar immergency ke saath hi bandhaa hua he
 He became the Minister of Information in the first government after Emergency
 bhavishya main kisi immergency kii sambhaavna ke prati desh ko sachet karke unhone apane hi netaa pradhanmantri narendra modi kii taanaashaahee pravritiyon ko aade haathon liya he
 Even if in his later statements he is found to be correcting it and giving clarification
 adwani ke naatakeey bayanon ke peeche bhartiya raajnneeti kii vidambnaa bhi chuphi hui he
 On the one hand we like a strong leader
 bangladesh yuddh main jeet ke samay indira gandhi kii lokapriyata apane charam par thi, jab bijepi netaa atal bihari vaajapeyi ne unki tulana durga se kii thi
 On the other hand, when the same leader commits arbitrary acts, we become rebellious
 mana jaataa he ki indira gandhi ke baad modi desh ke pehle majboot pradhanmantri hai
 Advani has already indicated that he should keep an eye on his steps
 vastav main, immergency kii 40veen saalagirah ne ateet kii smritiyon ko kuch is tarah se hamaare saamne laa khadaa kiya he, jinamein ham bhavishya ke andeshon kaa aks dekh paa rahe hai

 Chetan Bhagat's new novel 'one Indian Girl' has arrived in the market
 is baar chetan ne mahilaon ke nazariye se duniya ko dekhne kii koshish kii he
 But he has not been able to feel the pain well
 ladakiyon ko vaix karaate hue jis dard kaa anubhav hota he wo to chetan ko samaj aa gaya
 But what India, in any country of the world, some very bitter truths related to woman's life are missing in it
 darasalchetan celibritilekhak ban gaye hai
 Films are made on what they write, stars come to launch books and even cry after reading books
 unki is kitaab launch par kangana kuch isi tarah royee thim
 Chetan also launched a video in which he told how much it hurts women to wax
 har maheene yah dard sahanaa kitni himmat kaa kaam he
 Also how much they respect women
 yah sab dekhakar lagata he chetan chakachaundh bhari apniduniya main mahilaonke dard ko sahi tareeke se shabdon main piro nahin paae hai
 They look far away from reality
 kaash chetan ne in par bhi gaur kiya hota to samajhate ki dard kya hota he-periodssochie aap 10-11 saal kii ladki hai jise periods shuru hue hai
 The world of sanitary napkins at that age, going to the bathroom after escaping the staring eyes, feeling isolated from the children in class and the pain arising in the trees
 maah dar maah is prakriya main hone vaala dard, khun kii kami, chakkar aana jo bacchee sahati he vah hota he asli dard
 He has to endure this pain every month for the next 40 years
 chetan bhagat ke jalwe kaa daurpregnancypregnancy kaa sabase bada phayda he periods se mukti
 But it has its own challenges
 aap jaraa khud ko us sthiti main rakhkar dekhie ki gas se aapkaa pet phool gaya ho
 How much restlessness is there, something that a woman endures the whole time
 saath main acidity, morning sickness, allergy or kai tarah kii chunatiyaan
 The birth of labor and child is the greatest pain in the world, which the woman suffers
 7 se 8 ghante kaa lebar pen
 The unbearable pain she suffers and then gives birth to the child
 anek baar itnaa dard sahakar bhi mahilaayein normal delivery nahin de paatin
 If you talk to a woman, she will be able to tell you how labor pain is a million times more than the pain of periods
 kaash ye sabachetan samaj pate
 Today it seems that if we want men to understand what we can do - maybe grow a beard, smoke cigarettes, chat with mail friends, become a part of their talk, but their challenges can tell the same 
 kuch isi tarah kii baat chetan par bhi lagu hoti dikhti he

 In this era of inflation, everyone wants to get rich
 lekin amir banane kaa koi shortkat tarika nahin he
 For this, investment is the only way on which the goal can be achieved
 lekin nivesh kahaan or kaise karen ye mahatvapurn hota he
 The goal can be reached only by investing at the right place
 darasal har kisi ke man main yah sawaal hota he ki mehnat kii kamai ko kahaan nivesh karen taaki vittiya lakshya tak pahunchaa jaae
 Right now mutual funds are a better option for investment
 pichley do dashak se mutual fund main log nivesh kar rahe hai or unhen behatar ritern bhi mili hai
 Great returns on SIP for a long time If someone wants to invest for a long time then this is a good time for them to start SIP
 un niveshkon ko is samay SIP shuru kerani chahie jo kam se kam 3 se 5 saal tak nivesh jari rakhen
 If someone does SIP for 10 consecutive years, then he will be able to raise large funds
 mutual fund main nivesh ke tarikamutual fund main SIP teen tareeke se shuru kiya ja saktaa he
 First - through a mutual fund agent
 doosraa- brokar se online trading acount kholkar SIP karen
 Apart from this, the third way is to invest in a direct plan of a mutual fund
 iske liye mutual fund kii companiyon kii website par jaakar nivesh karnaa padataa he
 What is SIPSIP is a way of investing in mutual funds
 iske jariye nivesh karne par acha ritern paanaa aasaan ho jaataa he
 The way to invest in mutual funds is very easy
 systmatic investment plan (SIP) ke jariye kisi bhi diaversyphoid mutual fund main nivesh kiya ja saktaa he
 In the last few years, many mutual funds have received returns of up to 20%
 agar koi 10 saal tak 2000 rupee maheene SIP karata he or usapar 12 fisadi kaa ritern mili to yah 4
 6 lakhs will be Rs
 mahaj 500 rupee se shuru karen sipmyucuala fund main 500 rupee maheene se nivesh kii shuruyaat kii ja sakati he
 That is, no large amount of investment is required in mutual funds
 haalanki nivesh ke har maheene jari rakhane kii jarurat hoti he
 There is no age for investing in mutual funds
 There is no age for investing in mutual funds
 vittiya jaankaar aaj ke daur main har kisi ko mutual fund main nivesh kii hi salaah dete hai
 People of any age can do SIP in mutual funds
 agar thodi risk ke saath lambey samay tak esaypi ke jariye nivesh kiya jaae to duusare nivesh ke tareekon se ye behatar opshan sabit hoga
 In the long run, only mutual fund returns can fight inflation
 haalanki kuch mutual fund ne ummid ke mutabik parinaam nahin die hai
 In such a situation, investors in this fund must have been disappointed
 iske alaava chote niveshkon ke liye fund kaa chunaav karnaa sabase mushkil kaam hota he, kyonki sahi fund kaa chayan karne ke liye kaaphi shodh kii zarurat hoti he
 Therefore, consider all the aspects before investing in a mutual fund, if possible, consult a financial expert

 agar mahilaon ko muft yatra di gai to samaaj ke duusare virgon kaa kya hoga jaise ki chaatr viklang or varisht naagarik
 Which deserves it more
 duniya main koi bhi metro mahilaon ko muft yatra nahin detii
 If the Delhi government is more concerned about women, then i suggest that you give the ticket to the women directly and reimburse them
 dhyaan rahe ki dilli sarkaar metro ko jo bhi muaavja de rahi he vah taxpere kaa paisa he or uskaa haq he ki sawaal kare ki keval mahilaayein hi kyon muft main yatra karen?shridharan ne kaha, harkoi jaanata he ki yah ek chunavi pintara he,mahilaon kaa vot lene ke liye
 If the Delhi government has got too much money, then why would it not help the Delhi Metro to buy more trains and build a new line so that the already filled Metro will get relief
 jabaki meri jaankaree ke mutabik dilli sarkaar ne metro ke chauthe phase ko manjuuri dene main 2 saal kii deree kii he
 And also did not bring bus service for last mile connectivity
 vaataavaran or sadakon par bheed kam karne ke liye sarkaar ko yah karnaa chahie tha naki mahilaon kii muft yatra
 Sreedharan has further said that the safety of women passengers will not be increased at all by giving free travel
 metro se nikalne ke baad agar sadak bas pakadaney se pehle par kuch hota he to uskaa kya?aap kii sarkaar ko is kshetra main kaam karnaa chahie naa ki muft yatra dene par
 i appeal to your government not to ruin an efficient and successful public transport system like Delhi Metro for electoral gains

 The youth working under the banner believe that there is a lot of scams especially in online exams

 *** After Kulbhushan Jadhav was sentenced to death by a Pakistan court, the family of Kuldeep Yadav, who lives in Ahmedabad, in Pakistan's jail, has become more worried
 darasal kuldeep yadav 1997 se pakistan kii lahore jail main band he
 Pakistan has also accused him of espionage
 aaj 20 saal baad bhi ahmedabad kii rahane vaali rekha yadav apni bhai kii tasviir dekhati hai to unki ankhon se aansu chhalak aate hai
 Actually, Rekha has been continuously trying to get her brother out of Pakistan for the last 20 years
 lekin, har jagah se maayusi ke alava kuch nahin miltaa
 Whether Congress's government or bjp's line has knocked the doors of the government every time, but they felt disappointed
 rekha yadav kaa kahana he ki, pakistan kii jail main band coolbhushan jadhav ke faansee kii khabar jab se ai he unka dil baith gaya he
 Somewhere they have started to fear that something like this should happen to their brother too
 mere bhai kaa kya hua hogyahmadabad main 'ajtak' se hui baatcheet main kuldeep yadav kii bahan rekha yadav ne kaha, "coolbhushan jadhav kii khabar jab se ai he, tab se ek dar sa baith gaya he ki mere bhai kaa kya hua hoga
 Whether it is Congress or BJP, we have made a request to everyone for our brother, but no one could rescue my brother
 "naukari ke liye niklaa tha kuldeep yadavakuladeep yadav 1994 main ahmedabad se naukari ke liye ja rahaa hu aisa kah kar nikle the
 However, after three years, there was no news of him and then suddenly in 1997, a fisherman left from Pakistan reached his house and gave the letter of Kuldeep to his mother, then the family came to know that Kuldeep is in Lahore jail in Pakistan
 iske baad lagaataar parivaar vaale sarkaar ke chakkar kaat rahe hai ki koi unki madad kare or unka bhai pakistan kii jail se reeha ho
 Pakistan has accused Kuldeep of espionage
 2021 main reeha hogakuladeep ke parivaar vaale to ye bhi nahin samaj paa rahe hai ki unka betaa bhartiya jasoos kaise ban gaya jabaki wo zyada padhaa-likhaa bhi nahin tha
 The last message that the family got from the government was that Kuldeep has been sentenced to 25 years in Pakistan and will be released in 2021
 desh main har 15 minute par ek mahila se chhedchhad hoti he, har 29 minute par ek mahila ke balaatkaar kaa maamla hota he or har 53 minute par ek mahila kaa yon utpeedan hota he
 a government official said that the Center for Social Research conducted a study to assess what the police training academies in the four states of the country included in their training program in terms of sensitivity to women
 unhone bataaya ki kendra ne kai mahatvapurn siforishein kin
 One of these is that every training should be taught the sensitivity of women and special training should be given according to the need of the states
 masalan andhra pradesh main mahilaon kii taskari hoti he to desh ke uttar or pashchimi bhaag main aam taur par kanya bhrun hatya or dahej hatya ke maamle hote hai
 In December 2012, the National Crime Records Bureau's crime statistics against women have been presented in a report by the Second Administrative Reforms Commission, amidst a spate of cases of gang rape of a young woman in a moving bus and subsequent rape of girls across the country
 
 inamen har 15 minute par kisi mahila se chhedchhad, har 29 minute par kisi mahila se balaatkaar, har 77 minute par kisi mahila kii dahej ke kaaran hatya, har 53 minute par kisi mahila kaa yon utpeedan or har nau minute par pati dwaara krurta barte jane ke maamle hote hai
 The Commission recommended that there is a need to increase the representation of women at all levels in the police
 yah kaam sakaaratmak rup se hona chahie, taaki police main kam se kam 33 pratishat mahilaon kii sankhya ho
 The official said that ngos are being encouraged to raise awareness in the society on issues related to women and bring to light the cases of violence against women
 saath hi ve mahilaon par hone vaale aparaadhon kii jaanch main police kii sahaayta bhi karen
 She said that various surveys and research suggest that women often do not like to go to the police in cases of violence or cruelty
 yadi maamla darj bhi ho jaataa he to dosha sabit hone kii dar kaaphi kam he
 In such a situation, the Commission believes that it is necessary to make the police sensitive to the issues related to women at all levels
 mujffarpur balika grih balaatkaar maamle main bihar sarkaar kii karrwai tej hoti ja rahi he
 Two days ago, the government suspended officers posted in 14 districts for the post of Assistant Director and Child Protection Officer working in the Social Welfare Department
 vahiin mangalvaar ko mujffarpur SSP harprit cor ne karrwai karte hue inspector vinod kumaar singh ko laaparvaahee baratane ke maamle main nilambit kar diya
 Suspended police officer Vinod Kumar Singh is alleged to have found 11 women and 4 children missing when the police and social welfare department investigated the Swadhar Greh of Brijesh Thakur, the director of the girl's home
 lekin unhone is baat kii soochna SSP ko nahin di jisaki vajah se is maamle main praathmiki darj karne main 2 maheene kii deree hui
 It is worth noting that before the audit report of the Mentata Institute of Social Sciences was examined in the Swadhar Greh in the Department of Social Welfare, 11 women and four children were found there, but after this audit report, when the Swadhar Greh returned again in June
 When examined, women and children were found missing
 pichley dinon police ne swadhar grih par chhapemari bhi kii or vahaan se sharaab kii bottlen or condom jaisi kai aapattijanak chijen baraamad kii
 On the other hand, the pressure of resigning on Kumari Manju Verma, Minister of Social Welfare Department in the case of rape in the girl child house is increasing
 haalanki, mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne manju verma kaa samarthan kiya he or kaha he ki jab tak inke khilaaf koi saboot saamne nahin aata he tab tak koi karrwai nahin hogi magar naitikta ke aadhaar par manju verma ke upar istipha dene kaa dabaav he

 The opening pair of Virender Sehwag (23) and Manan Vohra did well with a quick partnership of 67 runs, but after that the success of Kings XI slowed down the run rate due to several wickets falling

 Earlier Akhilesh and Rahul have done a shared road show in Lucknow
 akhilesh yadav 'aaj tak' ke varisht samvaadadaata rajdeep se khaas baatcheet main kaha ki pichley dinon unki party main jo anban kii khabaren thim wo ab khatm ho chuki he
 Akhilesh said, 'we fought a lot till now, it is no longer needed'
 saath hi unhone upi main congress ko lekar bada bayaan diya he, unhone kaha ki yahaan kii jameen par congress kamjor he
 Here is the road show route: This road show of akhilesh-rahul, via Agra North, Agra South, Dayalbagh Engineering College, Bhagwan Talkies, Deewani Square, Sur Sadan, St
 Peters College, Hariparwat Square, Agra College, Chupitola Road to Chhipitola Square reached up
 road sho ke dauraan rahul-akhilesh kii hunkaragara main road sho ke baad sabha ko sambodhit karte hue kaha rahul gandhi ne kaha ki centre sarkaar keval 50 logon ke liye kaam karti he
 The BJP wants to do politics by spreading hellfire everywhere
 rahul ne aarope lagaaya ki piem modi ne notebandi kaa faisla lagu kar desh kii janata ko pareshaan kar diya
 According to Rahul, the central government is not worried about the poor, due to which poverty and unemployment are increasing in the country today
 vahiin akhilesh ne kaha ki upi main phir gathbandhan kii sarkaar banane ja rahi he
 Regarding the route, the leaders of Agra were at loggerheads for the road show of Rahul and Akhilesh
 congress ke sthaneey netaaon kaa kahana tha ki road sho agra south se shuru hona chahie
 Because Congress candidate Nazir Ahmed is contesting from there
 lekin sapa kaa kahana tha ki road sho agra north se shuru ho or agra south main khatm ho
 SP is a candidate in Agra North
 isi matbhed ke chalate guuruuvaar der shaam hi root final ho sakaa
 Ultimately, the Samajwadi Party was accepted
 akhilesh-rahul kaa road sho ke dauraan usee gaadi main savaar hai jiske donon savaar hokar lakhanu kii galiyon main nikle the
 After this, both will do road shows simultaneously in PM Modi's parliamentary constituency Varanasi

 The enthusiasm of the workers was at its peak in this roadshow
 phool, pataakhe, dhol nagaadon or laal tapiyon swa agra kii galiyaan pati thi
 Alam yeh it took more than three hours to finish the roadshow in 12 kilometers
 akhilesh or rahul non stop haath hilaa rahe the phir kabhi ek dusre ko dekh kar muskaraate or kabhi camere ke liye pos karte
 The roadshow passed through two areas of the SP and one of the Congress candidates during which sp's songs kept on playing and Akhilesh's sloganeering continued
 haalanki akhilesh kaa jalawaa rahul ke kaaryakartaaon par haaavee tha
 Two things have been taken care of in the roadshow route, one is that there are no electricity wires on the way and secondly, they come out from the roads where there is a lot of crowd
 yahi nahin yah sho vazirpura , nalband or chipetolaa jaise un ilaakon se gujara jahaan acchhee muslim jansankhya he
 The pair of Akhilesh Rahul was warmly welcomed in these areas

 Let me tell you, Ravi yoga has great importance in Hinduism
 ye yoga anek prakaar ke ashubh yogon ko dur kar detaa he
 On the day of Ravi Yoga, Lord Sun God has special grace and in Chhath also he is worshiped by offering Arghya to Lord Surya

 Women observing fast take prasad after worshiping Lord Surya
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne apane pehle kaarykaal ke dauraan 13 janvari 2016 ko pradhanmantri fasal beemaa yojana kii shuruyaat kii thi
 The objective of this insurance scheme was to compensate the crop losses due to natural disasters, insect attacks or fire
 lekin kai rajyon main kisaan ab is yojana se duuri bana rahe hai
 Informed people have also been pointing out flaws in this scheme of Modi government
 kisaanon kii aapbeeteeindia today kii ek report ke mutabik madhya pradesh main pichley saal ek kisaan ko 20,000 rupee kaa nuksaan hone par fasal beemaa ke mahaj 951 rupee muaavje ke taur par mili
 The farmer said that more than this he paid a premium
 vahiin purv mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ke grih jile sihor main saal 2017 main kisaanon ko maatr 4 rupee or 17 rupee tak kaa muaavja diya gaya tha, jabaki kisaan ne premium 1,342 rupee bharaa tha
 Such examples will be found across the country
 natijatan, fasal beemaa yojana se kisaanon kaa mohabhang hone laga he
 The government's goal was to cover around 50 per cent of the total sowing area under insurance by March 2019
 vajah yah ki 2016-17 main buaai ke kul rakabe kii 30 fisadi fasal hi beemaa ke daayre main thi, lekin 2017-18 main isamen kareeb ek-chauthai kii kami darj kii gai
 Expect budget
 
 
 haalanki pradhanmantri fasal beemaa yojana ko lekar modi sarkaar sakriy dikh rahi he or ummid kii ja rahi he ki bajet main isse judi khamiyaan khatm ho sakati hai
 Also, its scope can also be expanded
 dobaaraa satta main aane ke baad modi sarkaar ne kai yojanaon par kaam karne ke liye 100 din kaa lakshya rakhaa he
 Under this, the government will soon introduce facilities in post offices to increase the coverage of crop insurance
 kendriya krishi evam kisaan kalyaan mantralay kaa kahana he ki dakgharon main yah suvidha uplabdh hone se laabh lene vaale kisaanon kii sankhya doguni ho jaaegi
 In the Prime Minister Crop Insurance Scheme, the farmer is only 1 to 1
 5 fisadi tak hi premium dene kaa praavdhaan he
 The rest is paid by the Central and State Governments
 lekin sarkaar fasal beemaa se sidhe nahin judi he
 She asks for a tender from insurance companies who calculate her estimate of future losses and collect her premium
 fasal beemaa yojana kii khamiyankisaan ko koi kagajaat nahin diya jaataa he, jisase vah sabit kar saken ki uskaa beemaa ho gaya he
 In case of loss, the farmer has to report himself within 48 hours
 clem ke liye beemaa companiyaan manamaani karti hai
 Experts believe that one of the reasons for the declining interest of farmers is that insurance companies do not deal with claims faster, because the insurance policy is tailored to the interests of banks and insurance companies
 saal 2017 main niyantrak evam mahalekha pareekshak (kaig) ne apni nai report main pradhanmantri narendra modi sarkaar kii mahatvakankshi yojana 'pradhanmantri fasal beemaa yojana' main kai khaamiyon ko ujagar kiya tha
 The report said that due to the delay in providing insurance money to the farmers, the goal of providing timely financial support to the farmers was hampered
 kaig ne apni report main kaha tha ki jitne kisaanon par surveykshan kiya gaya, unamem se do tihaai (66
 66 per cent) farmers were not aware of this scheme
 gauratlab he ki pichley kai saalon se avarshan, olavrishti or tufaan ke chalate fasalein nasht ho rahi hai
 Farmers who were taking loans and shedding blood and sweat were going to waste
 nuksaan se bachaane ke liye centre sarkaar dwaara pradhanmantri fasal beemaa yojana lagu kiya gaya he
 We cannot deny seeing someone batting on the net, he will have to give enough opportunities in the match
 darasal lambey samay se team india main koi aisa cheharaa nahin aayaa he, jisane khud ko sthapit kiya ho
 Ravindra Jadeja, Stuart Binny got opportunities, but they failed to meet
 jadeja ko to ummid se adhik maukey mili
 Perhaps even this, Dhoni's confidence in the new players has come down
 ab hamen number 5 or 7 ke liye ek batting olerounder jaldi se jaldi khojna hoga, jo yuvi kii tarah gend ko boundry kaa rasta dikhaa sake or jarurat padane par wicket bhi le sake
 Our strength is batting
 ise phir se pahchaanana hoga or uske anusaar kadam uthaane honge
 Otherwise the team will keep losing and the fans will be disappointed

 The panchayat elections in Bengal are embarrassing
 matdaan shuru nahin hua ki kai jagahon par subah ke vakt hi bam bandook goli chalane lagi
 Normally there was violence after noon but in the morning violence started
 thane ke paas, poling booth ke kareeb hinsa hui he
 Bombs have gone and bullets have fired
 marpet to jane kitni jagah hui
 BJP worker is shot and killed
 trinmul kaa kaaryakarta bhi maar diya gaya
 CPM worker house burnt
 uski patni bhi jal kar mar gai
 Violence started before the election
 uske baad bhi aisi kya taiyaari thi ki is tarah kii hinsa hui he
 According to media reports, seven to 13 people are reported to have died
 ghayalon kii sankhya sainkadon main bataai ja rahi he
 In TV footage someone is carrying a sword and some face is being hidden
 is shart par panchayat chunaav main haar or jeet kaa koi matlab nahin rah jaataa he
 The state election commission should cancel the election itself
 bharat main kai rajyon main chunaav hinsa mukt ho gaye hai
 There Ghanbal has replaced Bahubal
 magar bengal main raajnneeti kaa charitra hi hinsa ho gai he
 If someone wants to make a place, then in Ramnavami, the journey of swords takes place, creates tension, if someone wants to save their place, they also take out swords
 is hinsa main har dal ke kaaryakarta maare ja rahe hai
 If the villages of Bengal continue to accept violence in a similar manner and the city remains uninterested, then one day there will be no point in winning elections
 hinsa ke detail bataa rahe hai ki bengal abhi bhi 80 ke dashak ke raajnneetik yug main ji rahaa he
 The comments chunaav se pehle hi vipaksh ek tihaai siton par ummidavaar khadey nahin kar paaya
 While there are many parties in the opposition
 bijepi, congress, sipiem, left kii anya partiyaan
 If all these together could not field candidates in one-third seats due to fear and violence, then this election should not have been held
 yah kya sandesh de rahaa he? koi vamadalon ke samay hone vaali hinsa ke aankadon se tulana kar rahaa he ki is baar kam he
 This comparison itself is embarrassing
 sawaal he ki aaj bhi hinsa ko kyon jagah mil rahi he
 The responsibility belongs to the Trinamool
 javabdehi se bijepi or sipiem bhi nahin batch sakati he
 This is the truth of Bengal
 sabko hinsa chahie
 Violence is the only way to reach power
 is sthiti main ek hi vikalp hona chahie tha
 In Bengal, elections should have been violence free
 ek chunaav adhikari ko jaan bachaane ke liye agar police ke saamne gidgidaana pade to yah manzar bhayaavah he
 All those engaged in the election system should be punished for not conducting violence-free elections
 barkhaast kar dena chahie or chunaav ko nirast
 In any case, there is no compromise with violence
 varna loktantr sirf unke paas hoga jinke haath main yaa to talwaar hogi yaa jinke paas dharmandhta se las bheed
 Elections in many states in India have become violence-free
 vahaan baahubal kii jagah ghanabal ne le liya he
 But the character of politics has become violence in Bengal
 kisi ko jagah banani hoti he to ramanavami main talavaaron kii yatra nikaalata he, tanaav paidaa karata he, kisi ko apni jagah bachaani he to wo bhi talavaarein nikaalte hai
 Workers of every party are being killed in this violence
 bengal ke gaanv agar isi tarah hinsa ko sweekaar karte rahe or shahar beparwaah rahe to ek din vahaan chunaav or jeetne kaa koi matlab nahin rah jayega
 The details of the violence are telling that Bengal is still living in the political era of the 80s
 tippaniyan Even before the election, the opposition could not field candidates in a third of the seats
 jabaki vipaksh main kai partiyaan hai
 BJP, Congress, CPM, other parties of Left
 agar ye sab milakar ek tihaai siton par bhay or hinsa ke kaaran ummidavaar na utaar paaen to phir is chunaav ko karana hi nahin chahie tha
 What is this message conveying? Somebody is comparing the figures of violence during the Left with the low this time
 yah tulana hi sharmnaak he
 The question is why violence is still being given place today
 zimmedaari trinmul kii banati he
 Neither BJP nor CPM can escape accountability
 bengal kaa sach yahi he
 Everyone needs violence
 hinsa hi rasta he satta tak pahunchane kaa
