 The proceedings of the British Parliament were to begin on 3 September
 lekin vipakshi netaaon ko bill laane se rokane ke liye piem boris johnson ne sansad ko nilambit karne kaa daanv chalaa he
 Actually, if the Parliament does not run, then the opposition leaders will not be able to present any bill
 iske liye boris johnson ko britain kii maharani elizabeth dwitiya se anumati leni padi
 Queen Elizabeth has allowed Parliament to be suspended until 14 October
 haalanki is puri prakriya ko shaq kii nigahon se dekha ja rahaa he, or ise loktantric prakriya kaa khaatmaa kaha ja rahaa he
 According to the news agency Reuters, if the opposition mps succeed in passing the bill that furthers the Breguit deal, then British Prime Minister Boris Johnson can hold a general election ahead of time
 mana ja rahaa he ki agle do dinon main chunaav kii ghoshnaa ho sakati he
 It is also speculated that the UK general elections may be held before 31 October, so that Breguit may be executed before the 31 October deadline
 british kanoon ke mutabik samay se pehle chunaav karwaane ke liye piem johnson ko do tihaai saansadon kaa samarthan hasil karnaa padegaa
 It is now a challenge to get this support for PM Johnson
 boris johnson ne britain kii janata se vaada kiya he ki chaahe kuch bhi ho 31 oktober se pehle britain bregsit prakriya puri kar legaa
 Now they are ready to go to any extent to fulfill this promise

 vanade cricket main gend par puri tarah ke balle ke dabadabe ke bich bharat ke purv captain rahul dravid ne isisi se apil kii he ki vah world cap khatm hone ke baad 30 gaj ke daayre se baahar maximum chaar fielder ko khadaa karne ke niyam par punarvichaar kare
 Under this new rule, it is always necessary for at least five fielders to stand within the radius of 30 yards during the entire innings
 is niyam ke baad maujuuda world cap ke lig charan main 17 baar antim 10 over main 100 yaa isse adhik ran bane jabaki 2011 world cap main sirf chah baar aisa ho paaya tha
 There have been 388 sixes in the league stage of the current tournament, while the entire tournament of 2011 had only 258 sixes
 ‘iespien crickinfo’ ne dravid ke hawaale se kaha, '30 gaj ke andar paanch fielderon par gaur karne kii jarurat he
 i think this needs to be reconsidered
 ' is diggaj ballebaaj ne kaha, 'isamen koi shaq nahin ki isse kaaphi adhik dabaav pad rahaa he or gendbaaj isse nipat nahin paa rahe hai
 This creates very big scores and i don't think it is necessarily good for the game
 'pehle 10 over main sirf do fielderon ko 30 gaj ke daayre se baahar khadaa hone kii sweekruti hoti he jabaki paanch over ke ballebaaji power play ke dauraan teen khilaadiyon ko baahar khadaa kiya ja saktaa he
 In the remaining overs of the innings, a maximum of four players can stand outside the radius of 30 yards
 rahul ne bataaya, 'hamaare kaaphi kareebi match dekhne ko nahin mili jisase romaanch badhata he
 Always hitting sixes and fours does not increase the thrill
 aap gande or balle ke bich acha muqabla dekhnaa chaahate ho jisase kareebi match honge
 In my view, now the matches are one sided
 ' dravid ne saath hi world cap main associat tiimon kii maujuudagi kaa bhi samarthan kiya
 Rahul said, 'I will support the associate teams to play in this tournament and give them every chance
 ' dravid ne kaha, 'mujhe pataa he ki unke khel kii pragati ke liye yah kitna mahatvapurn he ki unke khel ko vishwa cap main dekha jaae

 - personal lau cultural mudda he or ise protection diya gaya he
 The court cannot interfere in personal law
 - jahaan bhi duniya main personal lau main badlaav hua he to vah bhartiya samaajik va saskruthik paristhitiyon se alag he
 It has to be seen in the Indian context

 The Sangh has given its full strength to make Modi's Mission 272 a success
 sangh ke kaaryakarta bhi apane target 'booth jito' ko puraa karne main lage hai lekin kaam yaheen nahin tham rahaa
 According to RSS sources, the Sangh has conducted its own exit poll for the three-phase elections held so far
 sangh ke sutara bataate hai ki ye eczit pole kaaphi profeshnal or vaigyanik tareeke se kiye ja rahe hai or isamen sangh ke apane samvaad kendron kii madad bhi lee ja rahi he
 The sources of the Sangh are not ready to tell how many seats have completed their surveys or what the results are showing, but a wave of happiness can be felt in the inner cell
 sangh ke sutara bataate hai ki pehla eczit pole sangh kii gatividhiyon ke kendra or mukhyalay nagpur main kiya gaya
 If the Sangh is to be believed, the victory for the BJP from Nagpur is going to be ringing
 sutara bataate hai ki bijepi ke purv adhyaksh nitin gadakari yahaan se achche antar se jeet hasil kar sakate hai
 It would be a matter of joy and relief for Gadkari as he had to relinquish the post of BJP president due to allegations of corruption and this victory could re-establish him in the politics of the Center

 Ask them where the 1
5 million who were going to come to your account are
 jin mahilaon kii suraksha kii baat wo karte the, un mahilaon ko kisne poocha in paanch saalon main
 In the next two months, all issues will be thrown up, Priyanka said that in this election, ask the right questions

 Your awareness will make this country

 Priyanka said that those who talk about their nature in front of you, tell them what is the nature of this country

 It is the nature of this country that the voice of hate will be transformed into love and compassion

 Everyone was shocked to see the flames that suddenly rose

 On the second day of India Today Conclave 2019, YSR Congress President Jaganmohan Reddy, who is steadily gaining ground in the politics of Andhra Pradesh, answered every question with impunity
 congress main vaapasi ke sawaal par jaganmohan reddy ne kaha ki andhra pradesh main congress khatm ho chuki he
 Congress needs us, we do not need them
 congress-bijepi main jo bhi andhra pradesh ko vishesh rajya kaa darja degaa, main uskaa saath duungaa
 Jaganmohan Reddy said that we are not against Rahul Gandhi
 ham kisi par vishwaas nahin karnaa chaahate, kyonki ham pehle hi paanch saal kho chuke hai
 The Congress is completely over in Andhra Pradesh
 aise main hamen congress kii koi jarurat nahin he balki unhen hamaari jarurat he
 Congress does not believe in itself, otherwise what was the rationale for alliance with that party which fought against TDP for 30 years
 jabaki chah maheene pehle congress ne andhra pradesh main ek bocolate jari kiya tha, jisamen unhone chandrababu naidu ke desh kaa sabase bada bhrashtachari siem bataaya tha
 Three months later, the Congress contested the elections with the same Chandrababu Naidu
 apane upar darj maamalon kaa zikr karte hue jaganmohan reddy ne kaha ki jab mere pita jivit the tab mere upar koi cese nahin tha
 But as soon as i left the Congress, cases were filed against me
 unhone kaha ki mere khilaaf congress or tidipi ke netaaon ne yachika lagaai
 Jaganmohan Reddy said that the UPA-2 government was formed because Andhra Pradesh had given 33 Lok Sabha mps to the Congress
 reddy ne kaha ki hamaare upar darj kiye sabhi maamle raajnneeti se prerit hai
 The people of Andhra Pradesh have seen many such cases
 centre main narendra modi or rahul gandhi main kiske saath jane ke sawaal par jaganmohan reddy ne kaha ki andhra pradesh ko congress-bijepi main jo bhi vishesh rajya kaa darja degaa uskaa saath duungaa
 The YSR Congress President said that what happened in the Parliament, what was promised was not kept
 andhra kaa vibhaajan is shart ke saath hua ki vishesh rajya kaa darja milegaa
 At that time the government and the opposition agreed on the condition
 lekin ab bahanebaaji ho rahi he
 Jaganmohan said that i am not with either of the two national parties
 hamaari ekmaatr maang he ki andhra pradesh ko vishesh rajya kaa darja milanaa chahie
 In such a situation, whoever asks for our condition from the congress-bjp, we will go with it

 pakistani cricketer shoeb malik apni hone vaali dulhan sania mirza ke ghar achaanak pahunch gaye jabaki sania ke parivaar ne sanket diya ki shaadi dubai main nahin balki hyderabad main hi hogi
 Sania's friend Anil Kumar Yadav told reporters outside her house that the wedding preparations were going on and there was no change in the venue
 sikanderabad se congress saansad anjan kumaar yadav ke bete anil ne kaha ,‘‘ shoeb kal raat hi yahaan pahunchaa he
 There is an atmosphere of happiness at Sania's house
 shaadi kii taiyaari chal rahi he or sthaan main koi badlaav nahin he
 This put a stop to the speculation by Pakistani TV channels that the marriage could take place in Dubai due to threats from Ayesha Siddiqui, who claimed to be Shoaib's wife
 shoeb kii pehali patni hone kaa daawa karne vaali aaysha ne aaj daawa kiya ki uske paas yah sabit karne ke liye do gavaah hai ki vah 2002 main kathith vivaah ke baad shoeb ke saath do baar hyderabad main ek hotel main ruki thi

 usne kaha ,‘‘ yadi aap mujhase puch rahe hai ki kya ham saath main rahe the to meraa jawaab haa he
 It is sad that this also has to be proved but i have two witnesses

 The reason for Shoaib's visit has not been ascertained but he has arrived here amid reports in Pakistan media that his marriage may be in Dubai to avoid trouble from the families of Ayesha
 channel ne kaha he ki shivasena pramukh bal thakare kii dhamkee se ve dare hue hai or ayesha maamla bhi ek mudda he

 unhone kaha ki yah kisi ek vyakti yaa ek party kaa mishan nahin hona chahie

 unhone modi par tanj kasate hue kaha ki iskaa arth ve yahi samajhate hai ki jameenon ko kisaanon se lenaa or bade udyogpatiyon ke hawaale kar dena
 Citing the allegations of achieving low growth rates during UPA-2, Sibal argued that India has grown at about 2 per cent more than countries like South Africa, Russia etc
 unhone kaha ki agar ek bade scale par dekha, jaae to bharat kaa vikaas dar kam nahin kaha ja saktaa he
 At the beginning of the session, Rahul Kanwal addressed Vasundhara Raje as 'aam Aadmi Maharani'

 In such a situation, the ups and downs in the stock markets have started
 shuukravaar se ab tak sensex main 6 fisadi se zyada kii giravat aa gai he
 Contrary to the perception of many people, the shocking fact has come out that during PM Modi's tenure, the benchmark Sensex of Bombay Stock Exchange has given only 51% returns

 The report said, "bjp's wave is clearly weakening and SP-BSP seems to be getting 40 to 50 percent vote share
 aisa lagata he ki bijepi ko upi main 30 se 35 siten hi mil paaengi
 In such a situation, it seems that the BJP will get only 190 to 210 seats and NDA 220 to 240 seats
 iskaa matlab yah he ki endie ko sarkaar banane ke liye kam se kam chaar anya kshetreey dalon kaa sahyog lenaa padegaa
 However, traders are confident that whichever government comes to the Center will continue the reform process and make the business environment investment-friendly

 This question has become a big issue

 Now how would you face rifles of suicide bombers on the basis of sticks
 to kya yahi vajah thi ki jab tak hamaare jawan hathiyaaron ke saath morcha sambhaal pate, tab tak 5 jawan aatankwaadiyon kii firing kaa shikaar ho gaye
 From Jammu Kashmir to Delhi, the issue of Srinagar attack came to light on Thursday

 naksal prabhavit chaar rajyon kii baithak ke baad kendra ne kaha ki vah maovadiyon ke saath vaarta ko taiyaar he, basharte ve hinsa ‘tyaagen
 "home Minister p Chidambaram said," On the basis of Naxal-affected states, i appeal to all the Naxalites from all the Chief Ministers who attended the conference two days ago that if you give up violence
 
 
 ham aapse adhik kuch karne ko nahin kah rahe hai, yadi aap hinsa chhod dete hai to ham kisi bhi mudde par aapse baat karne ko taiyaar hai
 He was speaking to reporters after a meeting of chief ministers of Naxalite affected states
 is baithak main bihar or jharkhand ke mukhyamantri kramash: nitish kumaar or shibu sorain ne bhaag nahin liya tha
 Nitish Kumar told reporters in Patna that he could not go out of Patna for long as there is a meeting of the state cabinet today
 sorain ne apni beemaari kaa hawala diya or baithak main shaamil hone main asamarthta jaahir kii tathaa apane do up mukhyamantriyon ko baithak main bheja tha
 Chidambaram tried to postpone his absence in the backdrop of reports of Nitish Kumar staying away from the meeting due to Railway Minister Mamata Banerjee
 chidambaram ne kaha ki nitish kumaar ne unhen ravivaar ko dilli main bataa diya tha ki unka purv nirdhaarit koi kaarykram he or sambhav he ki vah kolkata baithak main shaamil na ho paaen
 He said, 'his superiors are here
 maovadi mudde par vichaar vimarsh ke liye yaa to main patna ja saktaa hum yaa vah dilli aa sakate hai
 This is not an issue
 ’ naksali mudde par grih mantri ne kaha, ‘shart’ yahi he ki maovadiyon ko hinsa rokani hogi
 The Home Minister said, 'unfortunately the previous appeals were turned down
 isliye jab tak naksali hinsa main sanlipt rahete hai, ham aaparishan jari rakhane ko baadhya hai
 These campaigns will continue and i am sure that there will be progress in the next six months
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘ham ise spasht kar chuke hai ki in abhiyaanon kaa makasad kisi ko maarna nahin he
 They are our own people
 hamen unki chintaa he, unki jaan kii chintaa he
 In order to help the affected states coordinate with each other in the campaign against Naxalites, the meeting called by the Union Home Ministry was delayed by one hour from the scheduled time as Orissa Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik arrived late
 baithak main pashchim bengal ke mukhyamantri buddhadev bhattacharya ne bhi bhaag liya
 When asked about the statement of the Chief Minister of Bihar, Chidambaram said, 'use of force alone will not solve the problem
 ham sabhi is par sahamat hai
 But to overcome violence and to re-establish civil administration, the use of force is necessary
 ’ nitish kumaar ne kaha tha ki maovadi samasya ko bal prayog ke jariye nahin suljhaayaa ja saktaa
 He said, "if the Maoists do not stop the violence, the government should continue a careful, controlled manner and concrete campaign against them
 sorain ne baithak main bhaag lene ke liye apane do up mukhyamantriyon raghubar das or sudesh mahato ko bheja tha jabaki bihar sarkaar kaa pratinidhitiv uske grih sachiv amir subhaani or dijipi anand shankar ne kiya
 The meeting discussed extensively the policy being adopted to deal with the Maoists and the coordination between the neighboring states as the Naxalites often commit violence in one state and flee to another state
 chidambaram ne naksali hinsa prabhavit chaar rajyon se kaha, ‘jab tak hinsa jari he, abhiyaan bhi jari rahegaa
 i hope that in six months we will be in front of you with some positive feelings
 ’ haalanki unhone kaha, ‘abhiyaan kaa makasad kisi ko maarna nahin he balki iskaa lakshya naagarik prashasan ko pun: sthapit karnaa or maovadiyon ke prabhaav vaale ilaakon par niyantran hasil karnaa he
 The Home Minister said, "we are making progress which is slow but continuous and we will continue it
" yah koi cricket ke score board kii tarah nahin he jahaan aapako har over main parinaam milte hai
 Three important Naxalite leaders, including a politburo member and two zonal leaders, were arrested during anti-maoist operations in southern Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Orissa
 ’is baithak main siarpief pramukh vikram shrivastav, atirikt sachiv (grih) diares choudhary, atirikt nideshak (ai bi) pi mahendra, sanyukt sachiv (grih) kashmir singh tathaa suraksha salaahkaar brigadier di es dadwal ne bhi hissaa liya

 gunjan singh ke metric paas karne ke baad unke pita ne politechnic pariksha kii taiyaari ke liye patna bheja tha
 But Gunjan did not feel like studying
 padhai ke kharch se ve cinema dekhne chale jate
 Expire for 15 days in a month
 iske liye pita se aksar daant sunani padati thi
 Gunjan's maternal uncle Arun Kumar was an engineer in Patna
 ek din unhone apane mamaa ko gaanaa sunaaya
 Uncle happy
 badale main unhone mamaa se gane bajaane kaa saamaan le liya
 When Gunjan's father Gopal Singh came to know about this, he was very disappointed
 tab mamaa ne samajhaayaa ki gunjan ejeeniyar nahin, gayak bananaa chahta he
 Gopal Singh says that there was a lot of trouble in the beginning
 dusron ko jab isaki khabar lagi to sunne ko mila ki betaa nalayak nikal gaya
 However he continued to send money to Gunjan
 ab gunjan kii safalataa ne unki chintaa ko dur kar diya he
 The name of Gunjan, a resident of Bhawanpur in Govindpur block of Nawada district of Bihar, has joined the famous singers of Bhojpuri and Magahi

 Twenty-eight-year-old Gunjan's journey to fame in the field of singing has not been easy
 shuruyaat main ve gaanvon main sugam sangeet or magahi gane gaaya karte the
 But the people making the cds of Magahi songs did not show interest
 studio ke saathiyon ne bhojpuri gane kii salaah di
 Then, with the help of family members, he took out a cassette named Very Good Lag
 haalanki vah chalaa nahin
 During the days of Gunjan Kanwar, he used to go to Deoghar on foot to sing songs
 tabhi man main vichaar aayaa ki kanvad yatra kaa album nikaalen
 Seven years ago, he released an album called Bol Bomb Boli

 a controversial song that came two years later became the reason for Gunjan's popularity
 unke padhe naa jib padhib, koching class kareke, kaahe ge, chummaa maange mustarva metric paas kareke gane ne gaanv dehaat se lekar shahar tak main unke naam ko charchit kar diya
 It became a favorite song of weddings, orchestras, djs, party ceremonies

 album main acting ke dauraan aae aatmavishvaas kii vajah se abhinay kii duniya main bhi unki upasthiti bani
 Gunjan with typical Magahi surroundings also broke the concept that only Bhojpuri-speaking people can play the lead in Bhojpuri films
 donon bhashaaon par unki baraabar pakad he
 One is their home language and one is the language of work
 unke kuch prashansakon kaa maananaa or kahana he ki unke gane main koi bhashaai fark mahasoos nahin hota
 Actually, Gunjan had a passion for music since childhood
 ve gaanv ke bhajan-kirthan main bad-chadhakar gaaya karte the
 Once he went to Nanihal
 vahaan ek naatak khelaa ja rahaa tha
 After the curtain fell, another artist was waiting for his arrival
 isi bich gunjan ko mike par gane kaa mauka diya gaya
 Pleased with his song, the organizers gave him a reward of five rupees
 iske baad se vah har saal aayojakon ke liye ek tarah kii jarurat ban gaye
 If seen, Gunjan's family background is extremely simple
 pita gopal singh kisaan or maa veena devi gruhinee rahi hai
 They are two brothers
 ek bhai naveen singh ejeeniyar hai
 There are two elder sisters
 gunjan ne metric kii padhai navada se kii or iessi shekhpura se
 Although he topped both examinations, but later examinations turned him on
 yah parijanon ke liye chintaa kaa vishay tha
 But his success has now become a pride for the family

 During the tenure of Gill, former president of the Indian Hockey Association, hockey saw many ups and downs
 ek wo bhi daur rahaa jab hockey ko lekar gil kii pratikriya behad ahm maani jaati thi
 There was a ruckus about the selection of the 2004 Athens Olympics team (especially Dhanraj Pillai's selection up to 100 days before the Olympics)

 If you think that only Samsung's flagship smartphone Galaxy Note 7 is bursting, then you are wrong
 kyonki ab yah report aa rahi he ki appal kaa nayaa iphone 7 bhi fat gaya he
 a user of the social networking website Reddit has reportedly said that the iphone 7 Plus is going to burst
 yujar ke mutabik yah kharidne ke baad box main hi fat gaya
 The post reads, 'something has happened between factory and delivery'
 yani yuj karne se pehle hi yah fat gaya
 Although most of the Galaxy Note 7 bursts have come during charging, this is not the case with the iphone 7 at the moment
 na to yah charge main laga tha na hi yah on tha
 It is being told that its battery may have broken due to some problems in transportation
 yujar ke mutabik jaise hi unhone box kholaa unhen fata hua yphone mila
 That is, either its battery will be broken on the way or during shipment
 photo main jo divaais dikh rahi he wo iphone 7 Plus he or aap saaf dekh sakate hai ki puri tarah se jali hui he
 It is also clear that it burnt in this way due to the burst of the battery
 company abhi iske bare main kuch bhi kehane se parhez kar rahi he, lekin aane vaale dinon main company isaki jaanch jarur karegi
 Because Apple would not want its image to be as bad as the Galaxy Note 7

 sansadeeyankalan samitike adhyakshamurali manohar joshine purv kendriya rigerv bank governraraghuram rajanko samiti ke saamne pesh hone ke liye kaha he
 The parliamentary committee is investigating the deepening NPA (non-performing asset) crisis in the country
 sutron ne india today ko bataaya he ki samiti ke adhyaksh ne 7 agast ko rajan ko patr likhaa he or ummid jataayaa he ki rajan jald hi samiti ke saamne pesh honge or samiti ko enpie kii samasya or usase ladane kii koshishon kis disha main bad rahi he par apni raay saajha karenge
 Significantly, Raghuram Rajan's tenure of Reserve Bank was completed in September 2016 but the Central Government did not take the initiative to extend his tenure
 iske chalate raghuram rajan ne rigerv bank ke kaarykaal ko khatm karne ke baad america univarsity main research ko tarjeeh di or unke baad kendra sarkaar ne urjit patel ko nayaa governor niyukt kar diya
 Read this: When the whole world was against India, then, Vajpayee had handled such economic claims that the committee has faith in Raghuram Rajan's ability and that is why he wants to try to fight the NPA as soon as possible
 Go khasbaat he ki samiti ke adhyaksh ne rajan se yah bhi kaha he ki yadi vah vyastata ke chalate jald hi samiti ke saamne pesh nahin ho sakate to vah maamle main apana paksh likhit taur par bhi samiti ko bhej sakate hai
 Murali Manohar Joshi has written in his letter that Raghuram Rajan should give his written statement on the problem of NPA and also explain how the problem of NPA has become so serious and in which direction the central government should work to control it
 
 ise padhen: laal kile se pradhanmantri modi kaa bhaashan sabit hoga 2019 kaa chunavi bigul?khasbaat he ki sansadeey samiti ke adhyaksh dwaara rajan ko patr likhane kaa kadam tab uthaaya gaya jab haal hi main kendra sarkaar ke pramukh aarthik salaahkaar arvind subramanyam ne samiti ke saamne enpie par apana paksh rakhaa
 Sources claim that Subramaniam told the committee that the credit for correctly identifying the NPA problem goes to former RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan and no one knows better than him how the NPA problem in the country became so serious
 ise padhen: NPA bana boj, bainkon kii sehat sudhaarney main sarkaar ke chute paseeneiske alaava subramanyam ne daawa kiya ki apane kaarykaal ke dauraan rajan ne is samasya ko hal karne kii mahatvapurn pahal kii thi
 Significantly, former Governor Raghuram Rajan had said during his tenure that the issue of non-performing assets (npas) should be resolved before merging public sector banks
 unke bahikhaaton ko saaf-suthra banaaya janaa chahie, taaki unki sehat main sudhaar ho sake or unke paas paryaapt puunji ho
 According to Rajan, 'I believe that the board of directors of banks should be active and it should include professionals so that their health can be improved again
 unhen peshewar banane or unamem se raajnneetik hastkshep dur karne ke liye lagaataar prayaas kiye jane chahie
 Once we have done this, it would be an ideal situation for banks to merge
 ' sarkaar ke sarkari bainkon ke ekikaran ko badhaava dene kii koshishon ko lekar kiye gaye ek prashn ke uttar main rajan ne yah baat kahi thi
 Significantly, despite Rajan's suggestion, the process of consolidation of banks was carried out without considering this suggestion and today the situation of banks has already worsened

 'ishrat jahaan cese ko lekar guuruuvaar ko loksabhaa main baari hangaamaa dekhne ko mila
 On the one hand, where BJP and Congress raided each other with accusations, on the other hand, Home Minister Rajnath Singh said that the whole world is plagued by terror and there should be no politics on it
 haalanki unhone kaha ki pichhali sarkaar ne is maamle main gadabadi kii or halafanama badalawaaya
 He said that an attempt was made to implicate CM Modi (the then Chief Minister of Gujarat) in this case
 rajnath ne kaha ki hedli ne jo kaha, usase ishrat ke aatanki hone kaa spasht sanket he
 The Home Minister said that the Congress had spoken of saffron terrorism
 'ishrat kaa kaam karne main juty congress'ishrat jahaan cese ko lekar bijepi saansad anuraag thakur ne congress par hamalaa bolaa
 He said that the Congress is now busy in doing the work which Ishrat could not do
 unhone kaha ki 'purv centre sarkaar ko sabane bataaya, yahaan tak ki puri duniya ne bataaya ki ishrat aatanki he lekin unka cese ensipi ke netaaon ne ladaa
 Our IB and RAW have been eliminated by the former Congress government
 iske liye congress sarkaar ko desh kabhi maaf nahin karegaa
 The Congress leader had phoned Satyapal for a false report, the then IPS Satyapal Singh, who investigated the case, said in the Lok Sabha that a senior Congress leader called me and said that you somehow proved this case to be false
 You have to do it and you have to become the CM of Gujarat
 iske baand congress saansadon ne jamkar hangaamaa kiya or netaa kaa naam bataane ke liye kaha lekin satyapal ne naam nahin liya
 BJP MP in Lok Sabha Nishikant Dubey on the Ishrat Ishrat Jahan case, who had come to kill CM Modi, said what death deal was done by this Congress, which is called the merchant of death
 bijepi saansad ne kaha ki loksabhaa main kaha ki ishrat ek lashkar aatanki thi or wo tatkaaleen gujarat ke siem narendra modi ko maarane ke liye ai thi
 He said that while acting on the IB report received by the state government, we killed the terrorists
 ham or hamaari sarkaar aatankwaad ke khatme ke liye patibaddh he or iske liye hamen maranaa bhi pade to ham isse gurej nahin karenge
 After 2009, when the UPA government felt that Narendra Modi could become PM, he raised the Ishrat Jahan encounter issue to put him in jail
 unhone kaha ki ishrat cese ko sabhi vot bank kii tarah istemaal kar rahe hai
 Many people even told her to be the daughter of Bihar
 congress is sach ko bakhubi jaanati he ki 2014 ke mishan main rahul gandhi or narendra modi hi takaraayenge
 Modi's target would be the functioning of the Manmohan government to the Gandhi family
 lekin rahul gandhi ko usee manmohan sarkaar kaa gungan karnaa hoga jiske daur main bhrashtachar kii nadi bahi to manhagaai ne aam aadmi kaa dam nikaala
 In such a situation, Rahul Gandhi will also need Modi, through which spreading the fire of Gujarat in the country, tell him through Modi but hide the meaning of Modi's Gujarat victory
 asal main jairam ramesh ne modi kaa hauva jis tarah khadaakar congress ko daraaya usamen gujarat dange kaa khauf nahin he yaa sampradayik modi kaa put nahin he
 Rather, Modi's growing stature is such a challenge that the Congress is helpless
 jairam ne ginai modi kii khaasiyat--modi adbhut prachaarak hai
 -modi elections will prove to be a challenge for Congress at the level of management and ideology
 haalanki jairam ne is baat kaa bhi zikr kiya ki--modi bhasmasur hai
 - He is indeed the first Indian fascist
 -corporate ne hitler kaa bhi samarthan kiya tha
 That is, in the coming times, Jairam openly gave an indication of what Modi means in Indian politics
 lekin congress apane rajkumaar ko chunauti ke maidan main utaarne ke liye ranneeti ke taur par sahi nahin maanati he kyonki isse rahul gandhi yani rajkumaar kaa aura khatm hoga or congress kaa myth bhi tut jaayegaa
 But it is difficult for the Congress that there is no Congress outside the Gandhi family and for the first time in the new situation BJP is becoming shorter than Modi
 isaliye modi ko lekar corporate ke modi prem ko jo aakhri sach jairam bol gaye vah manmohan kii iconomics ke liye bhi khatra he or is sach se har congressi aankh munde huye he

 raksha mantralay oefbi main vyavsaayikta or utpaadan ko badhaane ke liye usamen sudhaar laane ke lihaaj se saidhantik taur par pehle hi nirnay kar chukaa he
 Angered by the government's move, about 43,000 employees of the OFB have been on a month-long strike since Tuesday
 unka kahana he ki raksha mantralay ne ‘manamaane' tareeke se aayudh nirmaaniyan ko sarkari vibhaag se nigam yaa saarvajanik kshetra ke upkram main badalane kaa faisla kiya he
 However, a source said, "A high level committee will be set up soon to recommend restructuring of OFB

 '' Kapil Mishra's allegations have also been rejected by Aam Aadmi Party's close aide with Arvind Kejriwal, who has been opposed, but it is clear from the allegations that the way Arvind Kejriwal has been accusing his opponents so far , His colleague has done the same to him
 kapil mishra ke kejariwal par aarope lagane se pehle hi kumaar vishwaas or manish sisodiya apni patni ke saath kejariwal ke ghar pahunch gaye
 The meeting lasted for hours
 kapil mishra ke siem arvind kejariwal par aarope ke baad dilli ke dipti siem baahar aae or saare aaropon ko sire ne nakaar diya
 It was believed that Kapil Mishra was close to Kumar Vishwas, so he was removed from the ministerial post but Kumar Vishwas showed confidence in his old close but not his new close
 yah pehali baar he jab kejariwal par kisi ne karpshan kaa sidhaa aarope lagaaya ho
 Till now, even the opponents could not directly accuse Kejriwal of corruption
 vaise kapil mishra ne kejariwal par lagaae aaropon kaa koi saboot pesh nahin kiya
 Earlier, Kejriwal himself has also accused PM Modi and other rival leaders without any proof
 2012 main jantar-mantar par piem manmohan singh or unki cabinet ke 14 mantriyon kaa bina saboot istifa maangate hue andolan kiyaahal main piem modi kii degree or EVM tempring ke aarope kaa bhi koi saboot nahin diya gayakendriya mantri nitin gadakari par aarope lagaaya, manahani ke muqadame main jail janaa padavittamantri arun jetali par didisie maamle main bhrashtachar kaa aarope lagaaya, manahani kaa mukadmaa chal rahaa he Significantly, after being expelled from the cabinet on Saturday, Kapil Mishra on Sunday made serious allegations against Arvind Kejriwal
 mishra ne kaha ki unhone apni ankhon ke saamne kejariwal ko satyendra jain se 2 karod rupee dete hue dekha he
 When he raised his voice against this, he was expelled from the cabinet although the rest of the Aam Aadmi Party leaders are calling these allegations baseless
 mana ja rahaa tha ki kapil mishra kumaar vishwaas ke kareebi hai isliye unako mantri pad se hataaya gaya lekin kumaar vishwaas ne apane nae kareebi nahi balki apane puraane kareebi main bharosa dikhaaya
 This is the first time someone has directly accused Kejriwal of corruption
 ab tak virdohi bhi sidhe kejariwal par bhrashtachar kaa aarope nahin laga paae
 However, Kapil Mishra did not present any evidence of the allegations leveled against Kejriwal
 isse pehle khud kejariwal ne bhi piem modi or duusare virdohi netaaon par bina saboot aarope lagaae hai
 In 2012, jantar-mantar agitated demanding the resignation of PM Manmohan Singh and 14 ministers of his cabinet without proof
 There was no evidence of PM Modi's degree and EVM tampering charges
 Arun Jaitley accused of corruption in DDCA case, going on jail, defamation case is going on gauratlab he ki shanivaar ko mantrimandal se nikaale jane ke baad kapil mishra ne ravivaar ko arvind kejariwal par gambhir aarope lagaae
 Mishra said that he saw Kejriwal in front of his eyes giving Rs 2 crore from Satyendra Jain
 unhone iske khilaaf awaz uthaai to unhen mantrimandal se nikaal diya gaya haalanki aam aadmi party ke baaki netaa in aaropon ko bebuniyaad bataa rahe hai

 The politics of heated politics over the marriage proposal is that a verbal war has erupted between RJD supremo Lalu Prasad's elder son Tej Pratap and BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi
 'apane parivaar kii chintaa karen susheel modi'biharke swasthya mantri tej pratap ne bijepi netaa susheel kumaar modi ke twit par bada hi vivaadita bayaan diya he
 Lalu Prasad's elder son Tej Pratap attacked Sushil Kumar Modi and said that Sushil Kumar Modi should leave the worry of another's marriage, worry for his family

 'kunvara will remain the elder son, the younger will be married' Actually, BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi wrote on the proposal of marriage to Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Yadav that Lalu Prasad should be sent to his elder daughter Misa Bharti or The eldest son Tej Pratap should have been made the Deputy Chief Minister, but Lalu, following the accepted tradition, made the younger son Tejashwi Yadav as the Deputy Chief Minister
 or
 susheel kumaar modi ne twit main ye bhi likhaa tha ki ab bada betaa kunvaara rahegaa or chote bete kii shaadi ho jaaegi
 'tej Pratap is using his father's language' On this same tweet by Sushil Kumar Modi, Bihar Health Minister Tej Pratap hit back at Sushil Kumar Modi and gave a controversial statement
 bijepi netaa susheel kumaar modi ne tej pratap ke vivaadit bol par kaha ki lalu prasad ke bete ko lalu prasad kaa hi sanskaar aayega, ham logon kaa sanskaar kahaan se mil jayega
 He said that the way Lalu Prasad was using the language of abusive language, his son is using the same language

 The country's major telecom service companies have agreed to allow instant messaging of blackberry smart phones
 yah suvidha pradaan karne ke liye sarkaar ne antim samaysima 31 disambar tay kii thi
 The blackberry-based Canadian-based company Research in Motion (RIM) provided a solution to this problem and now blackberry services will be legally intercepted on a real-time basis
 sutron ne ravivaar ko bataaya ki kendriya grahamantralay ne suraksha agenciyon ko blueberi kii sabhi sevaaon ko vaastavik aadhaar par intercept karne ke liye kaha tha
 All the major telecom service providers including Bharti Airtel and Tata were not ready for this initially but now everyone is ready and they will install software for this
 rim ke bharat main das lakh graahak hai
 Sources said that the ministry had asked RIM, a Canadian company offering blackberry services, to set up servers in India and agreed to set up servers in Mumbai
 vodaphone or tata is tarah kii suvidha dene vaali shuruaati companiyon main se thim
 After that Bharti Airtel also agreed
 usne doorsanchaar vibhaag se kaha ki vah upkaran kii jaanch ke liye taiyaar he
 The comments rim ne ek bayaan main kaha ki rim ne ab ek aisa samaadhaan diya he jo bhartiya wireles sevapradaata companiyon ke liye kanuunan tanping kii aavashyaktaaon ko puraa karne main sahaayak hoga
 Blackberry's Messenger and Internet services can now be intercepted

 aakhir main kapil mishra ne kejariwal sarkaar ko chunauti dete hue kaha ki mere khilaaf bhrashtachar kaa ek bhi maamla dikhaaen
 Kejriwal will gather information about the corruption of the government
 In the evening, the workers' conference, it was decided that a big organization will be formed from across the country under the banner of India Against Corruption
 is dauraan yah bhi tay hua ki kapil mishra july ke pehle hafte se kejariwal sarkaar ke khilaaf jan jaagran yatra shuru karenge
 a shocking incident has come to light near Ghatshila of East Singhbhum in Jharkhand
 is ghatana main behatar ilaaj ke liye medical centre le jane ke bajaae ek marij ko police ne naale main phenk diya
 The patient wrapped in polythene remained in the drain for about 20 hours
 is dauraan barish kaa pani uske sharir par girtaa rahaa
 Because of this, the patient not only became a victim of pneumonia, but also suffered deep wounds on his body
 is puure maamle par police ne chuppi saadh rakhi he
 According to the information, no one even knows the name of the person fighting the death at MGM Hospital in Jamshedpur
 yah vyakti police kii ammanushik vyavhaar kaa shikaar ban is halaat main pahunchaa he
 On September 4, a man in pain on the road was admitted to the PHC Hospital in Jharkhand for treatment
 vahaan se behatar ilaaj ke liye mgm medical college refer kar diya gaya
 But the policemen threw him instead of taking him to the hospital
 gaanvvaalon ne naale ke paas ek plastic ke andar harakat dekh kar use kholaa to kambal main lipte ek aadmi ko dekh hairaan rah gaye
 His body was moving
 use dard or bukhaar se tadapata dekh sthaneey police isaki jaankaree di gai
 After this, the police ordered an ambulance and rushed him to the hospital
 philhal marij kaa ilaaj mgm aspataal main kiya ja rahaa he, jahaan uskihaalat gambhirbani hui he
 All the silence on the role of the police in this whole matter is kept
 pakistan main ateet or vartmaan aksar takaraate rahe hai
 The 70th year of the founding of Pakistan marks the 40th anniversary of the coup at the hands of General Ziaul Haq and the 10th anniversary of the siege and attack on the Lal Masjid
 in prabhaavshaalee ghatnaon kaa saaya pakistan ko nayaa itihaas gande se roak rahaa he
 When the Supreme Court declared Nawaz Sharif as commissioner of wazir-e-azam on July 28, many people in Pakistan felt that to some extent they were not seeing an old picture
 adaalat ne mana ki wajire-ajam kaa samvidhan ke un anuchhedon se takaraav tha jo janpratinidhiyon se 'sadik' (sachcha) or 'amin' (sadaachari) hone kii apeksha karte hai
 These provisions were made by General Zia only because he wanted to make the constitution of Pakistan according to his Islamic religiosity
 khud ko hataane ke liye samarthan jutaney kii koshish main khud sharif ne 1955 ke maulavee tamizuddin cese jaisi samanta kaa hawala diya
 However, the Supreme Court later used the 'principle of state requirement' and rejected a petition to dissolve the Constituent Assembly
 is prakaar wajire-ajam ko pad se hataane vaale saal 2017 ke aadesh ko aprihaary rup se pakistan ke 1950, 1980, 1990 ke dashak ke itihaas ke vyapak pariprekshya main dekhnaa hoga, jab adalati hastkshep ne sansadeey adhikaar ko nilambit kar diya tha
 However, many argue to the contrary — corruption that is deeply rooted in Pakistan can be cleared only when a sweep is done at the very top level
 in pratispardhi afasaanon or naaron ke bich pakistan kii fouj kii bhoomika yakeenan kendriya haih sharif kii puri avadhi ko civil-military takaraav ke rup main hi dekha ja saktaa he
 If his withdrawal is reminiscent of Pakistan's complicated history with the army, the reality is that Pakistan has missed a big chance
 sharif ne agar apana kaarykaal puraa kiya hota to yah pakistan ke itihaas main pehali baar hota
 Terrorist attacks have been a hindrance to the political developments in Pakistan regularly throughout the year
 vaise to saal 2015 se ab tak kul milakar aatanki hamalon kii ghatnaon or tivrata main kami ai he, lekin unka jad jamaaye rahanaa yah bataata he ki pakistani fouj ke daawey ke ulat shiddtapasand jamaaton or unke aakaaon kaa nae sire se jamaavada ho rahaa he
 In most such attacks, the targets are also predictable: Shia, police and military and easy-going people
 haalanki, sunni musalmaan bhi isse batch nahin pateru sindh main laal shahabaaz kalandar kii sufi majaar par hamalaa us silsile kaa hi hissaa tha, jisamen 2005 main islamabad kii bari imam majaar or 2010 main lahore main daata darbar par hamalaa shaamil he
 It also shows the deep enmity of all the terrorist groups from popular Islamic centers to the pious Barelvi
 haalanki, barelvi sirf isliye khabar main nahin hai ki un par baar-baar aatanki hamale hote hai
 In November, a dharna in Islamabad demonstrated his strength on the road
 unhone rajdhani ke janajivan ko darahamabaraham kar diya or sarkaar ko baatcheet karne or ant main samarpan ke liye majaboor kar diya
 It was headed by 'tehreek-e-labbaq or Rasool Allah'
 yah sanghathan 2011 main punjab ke rajyapal salmaan taasir kii hatya karne vaale mumtaj kadri ke kattar anuyaayiyon se taiyaar hua he
 In terms of numbers, Barelvi are very strong in Pakistan, but they do not have as much political impact as the Wahabis, Deobandis and the ahl-e-hadith
 in sabhi jamaaton ko 1980 ke afgaan jehad ke jamaane se hi fouj kii saraparasti hasil rahi he or iske baad unhone jammu-kashmir main seemaa paar aatankwaad main bhagidaari kar apni sthiti or majboot kii he
 It may be that Barelvi is constantly marginalized and feeling depleted
 aise main, haal main sadak par apni takat dikhaakar unhone bade rajnatik paridrishy main apni dhamak kii ghoshnaa kar di he
 Barelvi will now challenge the monopoly of Islamic elements in mainstream politics — formerly held by the jamaat-e-islami and Jamiat ulema-e-pakistan
 aprihaary rup se is nai rajnatik takat ke ubhaar ne pakistani fouj kii bhoomika par sawaal khadey kiye hai
 It is possible that there should be a role of Chanakya whose goal is to weaken Sharif and his party more and more by the next election
 haalanki pakistan main jis tarah se wahabi yaa devbandi sanghathanon kii aatanki hinsa jari he, uski vajah se khud pakistan ke satta pratishthan ne inke vikalp par vichaar karnaa shuru kiya he or barelviyon ke ubhaar ko isi sandarbh main dekha ja saktaa he
 The emergence of Barelwi in any sunset may be the long-term will of Pakistan's history in 2017
 saal 2017 kii ek gaiyr rajnatik ghatana ko bhi yaad karnaa jaruri he, jiske vyapak nihitarth ho sakate hai
 Pakistan is again included in the history of the census this year, and after almost two decades, the nationwide census has taken place
 2007-2015 ke dauraan pakistan kii aantarik suraksha kii haalat main giravat ko dekhte hue yah ek mahatvapurn prashasnic or rajnatik uplabdhi he
 However the result of the census was surprising
 1998 or 2017 ke bich jansankhya main salanaa ausatan 2
 Rose 4 percent
 sankshep main kahen to jansankhya vruddhi par ankush ke upaay kaaphi kargar rahe hai
 However 20
 7 karod kii vishaal jansankhya ke is desh or puure kshetra ke liye majboot nihitarth hai
 Pakistan is now the fifth largest country in the world, but in terms of economy, it is the 40th largest country in the world
 aitihaasik rup se dekhen to yah tulana kaaphi dilachasp nattejey detii he
 In 1971, the population of erstwhile East Pakistan was more than that of West Pakistan
 aaj bangladesh kii jansankhya pakistan se 3 karod kam he
 Pakistan's external environment is unfavorable; its relations with India and Afghanistan are in turmoil
 saudi arab or iran ke bich or gulf kooparation council ke deshon ke bich khinchataan ek or anischitata kaa dhurav bana rahi he
 But the most dramatic change has come in Pakistan's relationship with America
 raashtrapati donald trump ke kaarykaal main pakistan kii afgaan or bharat nitiyon tathaa aatankwaadi sanghathanon ko uski ore se die jane vaale sangrakshan ko america ne sakhti se naamanzoor kar diya he or us par dabaav bhi badhaayaa he
 The President, from his first tweet of 2018, not only introduced the essence of 2017, but also laid out the blueprint of what is going to happen next
 2017 main pakistan kii pratikriya yah rahi ki saarvajanik taur par akkhadpan dikhaate hue khamosh rajanyik prayaason se afghanistan main america apeksha kam se kam aadhi hi puri ho jaae
 But with the latest attack by the US President, it seems that this attitude also did not work
 duusari taraf, america ke khilaaf avagya ke tevar apnaane ke liye gharelu str par ban rahe dabaav ko bhi nazarandaaj nahin kiya ja saktaa
 2017 was certainly the year when Pakistan felt the most pressure after nearly a decade and a half, but it is important to recall the events of 2011 — another dreadful year in Pakistan – US relations — when the Raymond Davis episode occurred, Osama Bin Laden was killed and 20 Pakistani soldiers were killed in a NATO attack
 isaki pratikriya main pakistan ne lambey samay tak afghanistan main nato ke supplai root ko band rakhaa
 This underscored how difficult it is to deal with a country that has a population of 20 crore, which is nuclear power and whose geographical location is such that it cannot be isolated
 america dabaav bad rahaa he or baari sabit ho rahaa he, jiske baad pakistan apane ko bachaae rakhane ke liye rus or china ke kheme main shaamil ho saktaa he or usee ke mutabik apana card khel saktaa he
 However, its domestic circumstances will also affect not only India and the US but also external relations with China
 yah maananaa munasib he ki 2018 china-pakistan aarthik coridor (sipiisi) ke liye pariksha kaa saal hoga
 It is a fact that despite the support that can be got from the Pakistani army, it needs a stable political environment to implement such a big project
 pakistan main sambhawatah zyaadaatar log yah maan rahe hai ki america or bharat ab milakar kaam kar rahe hai
 Such a perception has further strengthened after the declaration of Kashmir-based terrorist organization Hizbul Mujahideen as a global terrorist organization in August 2017
 bharat ke saath bhi pakistan ke rishte thande hai, niyantran rekha par niyamit takaraav, vija kii sankhya main katautee or jehar bhari bayaanbaji kii vajah se isamen or giravat hi ai he
 The release of jamaat-ud-dawa (JUD) chief Hafiz Saeed just days before the anniversary of the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks was a sign that the dilemma of his relationship with India had not been resolved
 yah sab baar-baar doharaaya jane vaala ek parichit pattern hi he, lekin jaisaa ki bharat or pakistan ke sambandhon main hota rahaa he, usamen hameshaa kuch nayaa hota he
 Kulbhushan Jadhav, who was jailed in Pakistan for terrorism, was sentenced to death by the military court
 uske baad bharat kaa antarrashtriya adaalat pahunchnaa isi tarah kaa ek nayaa ghatnakram he
 For most Pakistanis, the significance of the Jadhav case is that it has also accused Pakistan of perpetuating terrorism in the same way that India has been imposing on Pakistan so far
 is masale par bharat or pakistan, donon jagahon kii bahes is baat ke irdagird he ki dashakon se bharat jis dwipaksheeya rishte se bandhana pasand karata rahaa he, ab usase dur ja rahaa he
 What kind of confidence is India showing today in terms of contact with the world, while Pakistan's attitude suggests that it is a victim of doubt and closed mindset
 saal kaa aakhir chintagrast pakistan ke 70 saal puure karne ke saath hua
 The general election is close, but the trick of civil-military is complicated
 rajnatik markat ne mukhyadhara ke kisi bhi rajnatik dal yaa netaa ko nahin bakhsha he
 Their declining credibility has given more space to various Jamaat-based Islamic organizations — Deobandi, Barelvi and many other extremist organizations such as the JUD — to establish themselves in the mainstream
 chunaav aise maahaul main hoga jab pakistan kii fouj siyasat ke centre main laut rahi he
 On the domestic front, accountability versus civil supremacy will collide with each other, practiced by Imran Khan and the Sharif family respectively
 in sabake baavjood, 2018 ke madhya main hone vaale chunaav mahatvapurn hai kyonki isse jo dhaancha taiyaar hoga, usase khulaasa hoga ki aage bharat ke liye kya chijen aakaar le sakati hai
 2018 for India is the year between the 2017 elections in Nepal and its own general election in 2019
 is saal pakistan, bhutan or sambhawatah maldive main chunaav honge
 There will be parliamentary elections in Bangladesh in January 2019 and also in Afghanistan
 in sabhi deshon main apni tarah ke masale or chunautiyaan hai
 All these countries will keep an eye on us and try to read the text on which we are following
 bharat ke liye vikalp, khaskar pakistan ke saath, kathin hi bane rahenge or use kai kharaab vikalpon main se hi chunaav karnaa padegaa
 But it would be useful to recall May 2014, when a variety of electoral changes demonstrated the solidarity of South Asia during the swearing-in of the new government in the courtyard of Rashtrapati Bhavan
 itihaas main waapas lautnaa nishchit rup se koi vikalp nahin he
 But there is nothing wrong in looking back in an attempt to write a new text
 kuch bhi ho, saal 2017 ke ant main bangkok main donon deshon ke rashtriya suraksha salaahkaaron kii 'gopneey' mulaakaat is baat ko rekhaankit karti he ki dakshin asia kii puraani ibaaraton ko asthaayee rup se to aap ek kinare rakh sakate hai, lekin hameshaa ke liye dafan nahin kar sakate

 antarrashtriya cricket main shahid aafridi kii behad shandaar vaapasi kii badaulat pakistan ne pehle ek-divasiy antarrashtriya match main west indies ko 126 ran se karaari maat di, or shrunkhlaa main 1-0 kii badhat hasil kar lee
 Shahid Afridi, who was left out of the Pakistani team during the Champions Trophy, not only set the record for the best bowling in one-day cricket for Pakistan, and took seven wickets for just 12 runs, but also five five-ball sixes and six fours in just 55 balls
 The 76ers also chipped in with help
 tippaniyan Afridi's fiery batting, declared captain Manbah ul-haq's half-century, and a 120-run partnership for the sixth wicket between these two players, was declared 'man of the match', with Pakistan batting first on a nine-wicket loss
 In response to 224 runs scored, Afridi's entire West Indies team was reduced to a total of 98 runs in 41 overs
 shahid aafridi apni ballebaaji ke dauraan pari ke 39wein over main kiron pollard kii gend par deep midwicket main darren saimi ko kaich dekar pavilion laute che
 On the other hand, Pollard or Chris Gayle could not do any good in the innings of the West Indies
 shuru main hi mohammad irfan ne johnson charles or darren braavo ko saste main out kar diya, or kris gail durbhagyapurna dhang se ran out ho gaye
 Just then, Afridi scattered the Caribbean innings
 champions trophy ke dauraan pakistani team se baahar rakhe gaye shahid aafridi ne pakistan ke liye na sirf van-de cricket main sarvshereshth gendbaaji kaa record banaaya, or sirf 12 ran dekar saat wicket chatkaaye, balki sirf 55 gendon main paanch gaganabhedi chhakkon or chah chaukon kii madad se 76 ran bhi thoke
 The comments 'main of da match' ghoshit kiye gaye aafridi kii tejatarraar ballebaaji, captain misbah ul-haq ke ardhshtak, or in donon khilaadiyon ke bich chathe wicket ke liye hui 120 ranon kii saajhedaari kii badaulat pakistan ne pehle ballebaaji karte hue nau wicket ke nuksaan par 224 ran banaae the, jiske jawaab main aafridi ke kamaal ke chalate west indies kii puri team 41 overon main kul 98 ranon par simat gai
 Shahid Afridi returned to the pavilion during his batting in the 39th over of the innings, caught by Kieron Pollard for deep midwicket to Darren Sammy
 udhar, west indies kii pari main pollard yaa kris gail koi kamaal nahin dikhaa sake
 Mohammed Irfan initially dismissed Johnson Charles and Darren Bravo cheaply, and Chris Gayle was unfortunate run out

 From this it seems that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party want to use the dispute with Pakistan as one of their main electoral bets to increase Modi's popularity and woo voters
 'akhbaar ne kaha he ki iske pehle aamtaur par dwipaksheeya rishton ko bharat yaa kisi or desh main chunavi masalaa nahin banaaya jaataa, jab tak ki yuddh jaise halaat na ban gaye hon
 The article states, "there are certainly some problems in the relationship between China and India, but it is not like moving towards a crisis
" iske baavjood modi ne chunavi muddon se dhyaan bhatakaane ke liye 'china card' kaa istemaal karnaa shuru kar diya he
 The newspaper said that the BJP was confident of winning the election earlier, but it is facing criticism due to all the domestic problems such as low employment growth
 bijepi ke kai vaade puure nahin ho paae hai, jisaki vajah se logon main asantosh he
 In such a situation, experienced politicians like Modi certainly do not want to miss the use of all the cards like 'china Card'
 yah card khaskar uttari bharat main chal jaataa he, jo ki china ke saath tathakthith takaraavon kaa mukhya morcho he
 "modi's popularity is decreasing! The newspaper said that Modi's popularity is declining, so he does not want to leave any chance to get votes
" isliye china card ke istemaal ke saath hi modi pakistan ke saath takaraav ko bhi badha rahe hai
 The BJP is awakening nationalist sentiments with a set goal and strengthening its staunch image
 kai bharatiyon ko lagata he ki pakistan ke saath takaraav main china ne islamabad kaa paksh liya he, isliye modi ke liye 'china card' khilne kaa yah acha mauka he
 The newspaper said that India's general election this year is quite complex and it is difficult to say who will win
 akhbaar ne kaha ki is saal bharat kaa aam chunaav kaaphi jatil he or yah kahana mushkil he ki koun jitegaa
 Significantly, on February 14, 11 days after the terrorist attack on the CRPF camp in Pulwama, India has given a befitting reply to Pakistan

 Question No
 1- Write an essay on the nature of GST in Kautilya's Arthashastra
 sawaal number 2- manu globaligeshan ke pehle bhartiya vichaarak hai
 Discuss 15-15 number ke ye sawaal banaras hindu uniwarsity (biechayu) ke eme (master of orts) ke political science ke paper main puche gaye hai
 However, students say that these topics are not part of their course under 'social and Political Thought in Ancient and Medieval India'
 paper taiyaar karne vaale professor kaushal kishor mishra ne kaha, 'hamane is par vichaar kiya or paaya ki donon vichaarkon ke darshan ko nae udaahranon jaise jiesti or globaligeshan ke jariye chaatro ko padhaayaa jaae
 He said, 'it was my idea to introduce the students to these examples
 agar ye kitaab main nahin hai to kya hua? kya ye hamaara daayitv nahin he ki padhaane ke nae tareeke khoje jaaen
 While reacting to the matter, one student said, 'sir had given us the answer to the question and said that these questions will definitely come in the paper
 ye topics hamaare textbook kaa hissaa nahin he, lekin hamane nots liye the
 'but students of colleges affiliated to BHU say that they have not been taught the answers to these questions and it is not even a part of their course
 'kautitya ke arthshaastra main GST kaa sanket'professor mishra ke mutabik kautilya (chanakya) kaa arthshaastra pehali bhartiya kitaab he jo jiesti ke vartmaan swaroop kaa sanket detii he
 The primary concept of GST is that the consumer should get maximum benefits
 jiesti kaa matlab he ki desh kii iconomi or vittiya vyavastha ek samaan or ekikrut honi chahie
 Kautilya was the first thinker to give the idea of integrating the nation's economy
 maaloom ho ki kautilya ko hi chanakya ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 He said, 'actually Kautilya gave the idea in his time that the tax rate on building materials of houses was 20 percent, 20 percent on gold and other metals, 20 percent on customs, 5 percent on gardens, 50 on dance and artists
 There should be a percentage tax
 'mishra ne apane chaatro ko bataaya he ki manu hi pehle vichaarak the jinhone duniya ko globaligeshan kii parampara se rubaru karaayaa
 He said, 'nietzsche has written a lot about this and praised Manu's economic, political and religious principles
 manu ke vichaar duniya bhar main faile or kai deshon ne ise apanaaya
 Evidence of Manu's views on religion, language and politics has been found in China, Philippines, New Zealand
 ve kehete hai ki newjiland main 'maanav' shabd ko manu se liya gaya he
 Professor mishraprofessor Mishra, who is a member of RSS, teaches the Indian political system and Indian political thought under the faculty of Social Science at BHU
 mishra ne is baat ko sweekaar kiya ki ve rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ke sadsy hai, lekin unhone ye bhi kaha ki ye nijee mat he or chaatro ko ve jo kuch padhaate hai, usase koi lenaa dena nahin he
 The head of the department RP Singh rejected that the questions asked were from outside the syllabus
 unhone kaha ki koi bhi teacher apni visheshgyata vaale kshetra se jude sawaal hi paper main set karata he
 No teacher asks questions outside of his expertise and what he teaches
 sawaal yah nahin he koun sushamaa swaraj ke saath he or koun virodh main he
 This is also diverting from the original question that Sushma Swaraj, a minister in the Modi cabinet, is fixing
 jis ekajutata se aresas, bijepi or modi sarkaar ne sushamaa swaraj kaa bachaav kiya he, usase yah katai nahin lagata ki yah khabar isliye li kii gai ki inhen bahut dinon se sushamaa swaraj ke bachaav kaa mauka nahin mil rahaa tha
 This news was published in London newspapers since last week
 sushamaa swaraj ne times nau kii patrkaar navika kumaar par hi ek twit daag diya ki dekho shuchita yani proparity kii baat koun kar rahaa he
 Sushma Swaraj has not challenged the journalists of the London newspaper The Sunday Times and Daily Mail

 lalit modi kii sohabaton main koun-koun he ye baat bemaani he
 Lalit Modi is not like those fugitives who escaped from Jaunpur, hid in Jhansi and got an encounter behind the hill
 vaise unke vakil ke mutabik modi bhagoda nahin hai
 No court has declared a fugitive
 italy ke shahar venice se patrakaron ko bataaya ki ve khabar par nazar rakh rahe hai
 It is alleged that Lalit Modi had to go to Portugal for his wife's operation, so that he could sign the mou for the operation
 bharat main lalit modi kaa passport radd kar diya gaya tha, isliye ve sharnaarthi kii tarah rah rahe the
 The photographs suggest that they are the most glamorous refugees in the world
 dilli hoicourt ne 27 agast ko unke passport ko behaal kar diya tha
 Therefore, it is difficult to say that Lalit Modi traveled to cities like Thailand, Dubai, Havana, Spain, Venice and Ibiza with the help of documents from Sushma Swaraj
 chaar agast 2014 ko lalit ne portugal se twit bhi kiya tha ki just spend a day at champali maude centre for unknown
 It is the name of a hospital in Portugal
 landan ke akhbaaron main unke cancer kii khabaren chhapati rahi hai
 As commissioner of IPL cricket, there are allegations of embezzlement of about seven hundred crores rupees
 bharat ke pravartan nideshaalay ne blue carnor notice jari kiya he
 Blue Corner notice is issued through Interpol to know where such persons are
 modi ke vakil kaa kahana he blue carnor notice jari nahin hua he
 In 2013, as finance minister of UPA, p Chidambaram had asked the British government to take action against Lalit Modi and hand it over to India
 zaahir he upie ne lalit modi ke maamle main khanaapurti kii
 But the question is why Khanapuri is happening at the time of NDA
 ek saal main modi sarkaar lalit modi ko bharat kyon nahin laa saki? kya sushamaa swaraj bataaengi ki kya-kya prayaas hue
 On 27 August 2014, Delhi High Court restored the passport of Lalit Modi, then the Ministry of External Affairs did not challenge in the Supreme Court
 is maamle ko britain kii nazar se dekha janaa chahie jahaan conservative party ke saansad andrew brijan ne sansad ke standard kamishnar ko likhaa he ki vah jaanch kare ki lebar party ke saasand kith vaaz ne kisi kii madad karne ke liye saansadon kii aachaar samhita kaa ulanghan kiya he yaa nahin
 According to the Daily Mail, last June, Keith Vaz wrote to the Director General of Immigration on an official letter pad that Lalit Modi needed a travel document to attend a wedding and accompany his ailing wife
 bhartiya mul ke saansad kith vaaz kii is chitthee kii badaulat 24 ghante ke bheetar lalit modi ko british travel dastauez mil gaye
 An email is also mentioned in London newspapers that Swaraj Kaushal, husband of Sushma Swaraj, had sought help from Lalit Modi for the admission of his nephew
 lalit modi ne is babat kith vaaz ko bhi email kiya tha
 Admission has been done
 ab sawaal he ki admician bhi kya maanviya aadhaar par kiya gaya yaa kisi len dein kaa hissaa rahaa hoga
 Sushma Swaraj is not holding a press conference
 twit kar rahi hai
 There is no doubt that she also helps the common people by asking for help on Twitter, takes immediate action, but the charge of help here is of the help of a person who is not coming to India and helping the law
 sushamaa swaraj ne kaha ki lalit modi ko patni ke oparation ke liye sahmati patr par sin karnaa tha, isliye maanviya aadhaar par madad kii lekin europea sangh ke anusaar oparation ke samay mariz khud apane oparation ke liye likhit sahmati de saktaa he
 a witness is required when the patient is unable to speak or write
 portugal europea sangh kaa sadsy he
 According to Portugal's own law, patients can consent to their operation in any way
 to kya sahmati kaa bahaanaa banaaya gaya? kya ek vyakti jiske khilaaf blue corner notice ho vah itani aasaani se bharat ke videsh mantri se sampark kar saktaa he
 On Sunday, Sushma Swaraj tweeted and clarified in July 2014, Lalit Modi told me that his wife is to have a cancer operation in Portugal on August 4
 sahmati patr par dastakht karne ke liye unka vahaan rahanaa zaruri he
 He asked for help in issuing travel documents
 maine maanviya aadhaar par british ucchayukta se kaha ki is maamle main british sarkaar apane kanoon ke aadhaar par vichaar kare
 If Britain issues travel documents to them, it will not spoil the relationship between the two countries
 vaaj ne bhi mujhase baat kii
 i said the same thing to him, who had said to the British High Commissioner
 sahmati patr par dastakhat ke liye hona zaruri nahin he
 The question is also whether Sushma Swaraj informed the Indian Embassy while helping
 kya lalit modi se kaha ki badale main aapako samparn karnaa hoga? pravartan nideshaalay kii is vivaad ke saamne aane ke baad kya bhoomika he? kya sushamaa swaraj ne pravartan nideshaalay ko soochna di ki lalit modi kii maanviya aadhaar par madad kii gai he? On 7 May 2014, when the DNA newspaper asked Lalit Modi when he was going to return to India, he said that two weeks were left
 chunaav ke nattejey aane do tab ham baat karte hai
 This is called confidence
 tippaniyan Meanwhile, in the evening, there was a press conference of Prakash Javadekar
 unhone kaha ki congress lalit modi narendra modi or amit shah kii jo tasviren dikhaa rahi hai, wo 2010 kii hai
 What is the point of showing in 2015 rajeev shukla or jyotiraditya sindhiya kii sainkadon tasviren hai
 Why old photos are being shown
 sonia gandhi or rahul gandhi kii koyala or 2 ji ghotaale ke aropiyon ke saath tasviren hai
 Prakash Javadekar left with two questions, whose government allowed Lalit Modi to go to London
 congress ke netaa kahaan chuttee manaane gaye the
 a question is being raised in front of every question
 kya puraane maamalon ko nikaal kar bijepi or modi sarkaar in sawaalon se batch sakati he
 The prison inmate has a humanitarian base, he has been released on parole, the accused has gone abroad with the permission of the court
 prime time Sushma Swaraj also stole a tweet on Times Now journalist Navika Kumar to see who is talking about transparency
 sushamaa swaraj ne landan ke akhbaar da sande times or daily mail ke patrakaron ko chalange nahin kiya he
 There has been considerable political pressure on this issue, but due to which there is tension
 unhen aap dekhenge to lagegaa ki iees topper hon
 Who is who in Lalit Modi's feelings is meaningless
 lalit modi un bhagodon kii tarah nahin he, jo jonpur se bhagkar jhaansi main chhip gaye or pahari ke peeche encounter ho gaya
 According to his lawyer, Modi is not a fugitive
 kisi court ne bhagoda ghoshit nahin kiya he
 Journalists from the Italian city of Venice told that they are keeping an eye on the news
 aarope he ki lalit modi ko patni ke oparation ke liye portugal janaa tha, taaki ve oparation ke liye sahmati patr par dastakhat kar saken
 Lalit Modi's passport in India was canceled, so he was living as a refugee
 tasveeron se to lagata he ki ye duniya ke sabase glamras sharnaarthi hai
 His passport was reinstated by the Delhi High Court on 27 August
 isliye kahana mushkil he ki lalit modi ne sushamaa swaraj kii badaulat se mili dastavejon ke sahare thailand, dubai, hawana, spain, venice or ibiza jaise shaharon kii yatra kii
 On August 4, 2014, Lalit also tweeted from Portugal that just spend a day at champali maude center for unknown
 yah portugal ke aspataal kaa naam he
 News of his cancer has been published in London newspapers
 ipel cricket ke kamishnar ke taur par kareeb saat sau karod rupee ke gaban kaa aarope he
 The Enforcement Directorate of India has issued a blue corner notice
 interpol ke zarie blue carnor notice jari kiya jaataa he taaki pataa rahe ki amuk vyakti kahaan hai
 Modi's lawyer says the blue corner notice has not been issued
 saal 2013 main upie ke vitt mantri ke taur par pi chidambaram ne british sarkaar se kaha tha ki vah lalit modi ke kilaaf karrwai kare or bharat ko saunp de
 It is obvious that UPA made a report in the case of Lalit Modi
 lekin sawaal yah he ki endie ke samay khanaapurti kyon ho rahi he
 Why the Modi government could not bring Lalit Modi to India in a year? Will Sushma Swaraj tell what efforts were made
 27 agast 2014 main dilli hoicourt ne lalit modi kaa passport behaal kiya, tab videsh mantralay ne supreme court main chunauti bhi nahin di
 The case should be looked at in the UK where Conservative Party MP Andrew Bridgen has written to the Parliament's Standards Commissioner to investigate whether Labor party member Keith Vaz violated the mps' code of conduct to help someone Yes or No
 daily mail ke anusaar pichley june main kith vaaz ne imigration ke mahanideshak ko oficial letters pad par likhaa tha ki lalit modi ko ek shaadi main shariq hone ke liye or apni biimaar patni ke saath jane ke liye travel dacument chahie
 Lalit Modi got British travel documents within 24 hours thanks to this letter from Indian-origin MP Keith Vaz
 landan ke akhbaaron main ek email kaa bhi zikr ho rahaa he ki sushamaa swaraj ke pati swaraj kaushal ne lalit modi se apane bhattije ke admician ke liye madad maangi thi
 Lalit Modi had also emailed Keith Vaz regarding this
 admician ho chukaa he
 Now the question is whether the admission was done on humanitarian basis or was part of any transaction
 sushamaa swaraj press conference nahin kar rahi hai
 Is tweeting
 isamen koi shaq nahin ki twitor par madad maangane par ve aam logon kii bhi madad karti hai, turant ection leti hai, lekin yahaan madad kaa aarope ek aise vyakti kii madad kaa he jo bharat aakar kanoon kii madad nahin kar rahaa he
 Sushma Swaraj said that Lalit Modi had to sign a consent letter for his wife's operation, so helped on humanitarian grounds, but according to the European Union, at the time of the operation, the patients themselves can give written consent for their operation
 gavaah kii zarurat tab padati he, jab mariz bolne yaa likhane main asamarth ho
 Portugal is a member of the European Union
 portugal ke apane ke kanoon ke anusaar mariz kisi bhi tareeke se apane oparation kii sahmati de saktaa he
 So what was the excuse for consent? Can a person against whom a Blue Corner notice be so easily contacted by the Foreign Minister of India
 ravivaar ko sushamaa swaraj ne twit kar safai di july 2014 main lalit modi ne mujhe bataaya ki unki patni kaa chaar agast ko portugal main cancer kaa oparation hona he
 They have to be there to sign the consent form
 unhone yatra dastauez jari karaane main madad maangi
 i asked the British High Commissioner on humanitarian grounds to consider the British government on the basis of its law in this matter
 agar britain unhen yatra dastauez jari karata he to isse donon deshon ke rishte kharaab nahin honge
 Vaz also spoke to me
 maine unase bhi vahiin baat kahi, jo british ucchayukta se kahi thi
 The consent letter does not have to be signed
 sawaal yah bhi he ki madad karte vakt kya sushamaa swaraj ne bhartiya duutavas ko jaankaree di
 Did you say to Lalit Modi that you have to surrender in return? What is the role of the Enforcement Directorate after the controversy unfolds? Did Sushma Swaraj inform the Enforcement Directorate that Lalit Modi has been helped on humanitarian grounds? diene akhbaar ne 7 may 2014 ko jab lalit modi se poocha ki aap bharat kab waapas aane vaale hai, tab unhone kaha tha ki do hafte rah gaye hai
 Let us talk about the election results
 ise kehete hai confidence
 The comments is bich shaam hote-hote prakaash jaavdekar kii ek press conference hui
 He said that the pictures of Congress Lalit Modi, Narendra Modi and Amit Shah are showing in 2010

 There are pictures of Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi with coal and 2G scam accused
 prakaash jaavdekar do sawaal puch kar chale gaye ki lalit modi ko kiski sarkaar ne landan jane diya
 Where did the Congress leaders go on holiday? har sawaal ke saamne ek sawaal khadaa kiya ja rahaa he
 Can BJP and Modi government avoid these questions by removing old cases

 On August 4, 2014, Lalit also tweeted from Portugal that just spend a day at champali maude center for unknown

 It is obvious that UPA made a report in the case of Lalit Modi
 lekin sawaal yah he ki endie ke samay khanaapurti kyon ho rahi he
 Why the Modi government could not bring Lalit Modi to India in a year? Will Sushma Swaraj tell what efforts were made
 27 agast 2014 main dilli hoicourt ne lalit modi kaa passport behaal kiya, tab videsh mantralay ne supreme court main chunauti bhi nahin di
 The case should be looked at in the UK where Conservative Party MP Andrew Bridgen has written to the Parliament's Standards Commissioner to investigate whether Labor party member Keith Vaz violated the mps' code of conduct to help someone Yes or No
 daily mail ke anusaar pichley june main kith vaaz ne imigration ke mahanideshak ko oficial letters pad par likhaa tha ki lalit modi ko ek shaadi main shariq hone ke liye or apni biimaar patni ke saath jane ke liye travel dacument chahie
 Lalit Modi got British travel documents within 24 hours thanks to this letter from Indian-origin MP Keith Vaz
 landan ke akhbaaron main ek email kaa bhi zikr ho rahaa he ki sushamaa swaraj ke pati swaraj kaushal ne lalit modi se apane bhattije ke admician ke liye madad maangi thi
 Lalit Modi had also emailed Keith Vaz regarding this
 admician ho chukaa he
 Now the question is whether the admission was done on humanitarian basis or was part of any transaction
 sushamaa swaraj press conference nahin kar rahi hai
 Is tweeting
 isamen koi shaq nahin ki twitor par madad maangane par ve aam logon kii bhi madad karti hai, turant ection leti hai, lekin yahaan madad kaa aarope ek aise vyakti kii madad kaa he jo bharat aakar kanoon kii madad nahin kar rahaa he
 Sushma Swaraj said that Lalit Modi had to sign a consent letter for his wife's operation, so helped on humanitarian grounds, but according to the European Union, at the time of the operation, the patients themselves can give written consent for their operation
 gavaah kii zarurat tab padati he, jab mariz bolne yaa likhane main asamarth ho
 Portugal is a member of the European Union
 portugal ke apane ke kanoon ke anusaar mariz kisi bhi tareeke se apane oparation kii sahmati de saktaa he
 So what was the excuse for consent? Can a person against whom a Blue Corner notice be so easily contacted by the Foreign Minister of India
 ravivaar ko sushamaa swaraj ne twit kar safai di july 2014 main lalit modi ne mujhe bataaya ki unki patni kaa chaar agast ko portugal main cancer kaa oparation hona he
 They have to be there to sign the consent form
 unhone yatra dastauez jari karaane main madad maangi
 i asked the British High Commissioner on humanitarian grounds to consider the British government on the basis of its law in this matter
 agar britain unhen yatra dastauez jari karata he to isse donon deshon ke rishte kharaab nahin honge
 Vaz also spoke to me
 maine unase bhi vahiin baat kahi, jo british ucchayukta se kahi thi
 The consent letter does not have to be signed
 sawaal yah bhi he ki madad karte vakt kya sushamaa swaraj ne bhartiya duutavas ko jaankaree di
 Did you say to Lalit Modi that you have to surrender in return? What is the role of the Enforcement Directorate after the controversy unfolds? Did Sushma Swaraj inform the Enforcement Directorate that Lalit Modi has been helped on humanitarian grounds? diene akhbaar ne 7 may 2014 ko jab lalit modi se poocha ki aap bharat kab waapas aane vaale hai, tab unhone kaha tha ki do hafte rah gaye hai
 Let us talk about the election results

 Prime time aarope he ki lalit modi ko patni ke oparation ke liye portugal janaa tha, taaki ve oparation ke liye sahmati patr par dastakhat kar saken
 Lalit Modi's passport in India was canceled, so he was living as a refugee
 tasveeron se to lagata he ki ye duniya ke sabase glamras sharnaarthi hai
 His passport was reinstated by the Delhi High Court on 27 August
 isliye kahana mushkil he ki lalit modi ne sushamaa swaraj kii badaulat se mili dastavejon ke sahare thailand, dubai, hawana, spain, venice or ibiza jaise shaharon kii yatra kii
 On August 4, 2014, Lalit also tweeted from Portugal that just spend a day at champali maude center for unknown

 Prime time dilli hoicourt ne 27 agast ko unke passport ko behaal kar diya tha
 Therefore, it is difficult to say that Lalit Modi traveled to cities like Thailand, Dubai, Havana, Spain, Venice and Ibiza with the help of documents from Sushma Swaraj
 chaar agast 2014 ko lalit ne portugal se twit bhi kiya tha ki just spend a day at champali maude centre for unknown
 It is the name of a hospital in Portugal
 landan ke akhbaaron main unke cancer kii khabaren chhapati rahi hai
 As commissioner of IPL cricket, there are allegations of embezzlement of about seven hundred crores rupees
 bharat ke pravartan nideshaalay ne blue carnor notice jari kiya he
 Blue Corner notice is issued through Interpol to know where such persons are
 modi ke vakil kaa kahana he blue carnor notice jari nahin hua he
 In 2013, as finance minister of UPA, p Chidambaram had asked the British government to take action against Lalit Modi and hand it over to India
 zaahir he upie ne lalit modi ke maamle main khanaapurti kii
 But the question is why Khanapuri is happening at the time of NDA
 ek saal main modi sarkaar lalit modi ko bharat kyon nahin laa saki? kya sushamaa swaraj bataaengi ki kya-kya prayaas hue
 On 27 August 2014, Delhi High Court restored the passport of Lalit Modi, then the Ministry of External Affairs did not challenge in the Supreme Court
 is maamle ko britain kii nazar se dekha janaa chahie jahaan conservative party ke saansad andrew brijan ne sansad ke standard kamishnar ko likhaa he ki vah jaanch kare ki lebar party ke saasand kith vaaz ne kisi kii madad karne ke liye saansadon kii aachaar samhita kaa ulanghan kiya he yaa nahin
 According to the Daily Mail, last June, Keith Vaz wrote to the Director General of Immigration on an official letter pad that Lalit Modi needed a travel document to attend a wedding and accompany his ailing wife
 bhartiya mul ke saansad kith vaaz kii is chitthee kii badaulat 24 ghante ke bheetar lalit modi ko british travel dastauez mil gaye
 An email is also mentioned in London newspapers that Swaraj Kaushal, husband of Sushma Swaraj, had sought help from Lalit Modi for the admission of his nephew
 lalit modi ne is babat kith vaaz ko bhi email kiya tha
 Admission has been done
 ab sawaal he ki admician bhi kya maanviya aadhaar par kiya gaya yaa kisi len dein kaa hissaa rahaa hoga
 Sushma Swaraj is not holding a press conference
 twit kar rahi hai
 There is no doubt that she also helps the common people by asking for help on Twitter, takes immediate action, but the charge of help here is of the help of a person who is not coming to India and helping the law
 sushamaa swaraj ne kaha ki lalit modi ko patni ke oparation ke liye sahmati patr par sin karnaa tha, isliye maanviya aadhaar par madad kii lekin europea sangh ke anusaar oparation ke samay mariz khud apane oparation ke liye likhit sahmati de saktaa he
 a witness is required when the patient is unable to speak or write
 portugal europea sangh kaa sadsy he
 According to Portugal's own law, patients can consent to their operation in any way
 to kya sahmati kaa bahaanaa banaaya gaya? kya ek vyakti jiske khilaaf blue corner notice ho vah itani aasaani se bharat ke videsh mantri se sampark kar saktaa he
 On Sunday, Sushma Swaraj tweeted and clarified in July 2014, Lalit Modi told me that his wife is to have a cancer operation in Portugal on August 4
 sahmati patr par dastakht karne ke liye unka vahaan rahanaa zaruri he
 He asked for help in issuing travel documents
 maine maanviya aadhaar par british ucchayukta se kaha ki is maamle main british sarkaar apane kanoon ke aadhaar par vichaar kare
 If Britain issues travel documents to them, it will not spoil the relationship between the two countries
 vaaj ne bhi mujhase baat kii
 i said the same thing to him, who had said to the British High Commissioner
 sahmati patr par dastakhat ke liye hona zaruri nahin he
 The question is also whether Sushma Swaraj informed the Indian Embassy while helping
 kya lalit modi se kaha ki badale main aapako samparn karnaa hoga? pravartan nideshaalay kii is vivaad ke saamne aane ke baad kya bhoomika he? kya sushamaa swaraj ne pravartan nideshaalay ko soochna di ki lalit modi kii maanviya aadhaar par madad kii gai he? On 7 May 2014, when the DNA newspaper asked Lalit Modi when he was going to return to India, he said that two weeks were left

 haal hi main jo ye PAC kii baithak bulaai gai thi, usamen bhi unhen nahin bulaayaa gaya tha
 Kumar Vishwas also tweeted after this decision

 Kumar wrote that some successful "inanimate" in explaining this politics to you, what did you get by making these "self-styled dwarfs" a court? ""

 co / mbg1wvgkj0— Dr Kumar Vishvas (@drkumarvishwas) April 11, 2018 The Aam Aadmi Party said that the party had sent Deepak Vajpayee to visit Rajasthan in the past
 ab wo vahiin rahete hai or puure rajya kaa daura kar chuke hai
 The battle started from the Rajya Sabha elections is that since the Rajya Sabha elections in Delhi, Kumar Vishwas has been the top leadership of the party
 party ne kumaar vishwaas ko rajyasabha kaa tikat nahin diya tha
 Rather Sanjay Singh, Narayan Das Gupta and Sushil Gupta were sent to Rajya Sabha
 isamen endi gupta or susheel gupta ko lekar kaaphi vivaad hua tha
 Will kill but will not let martyrdom! Kumar Vishwas openly targeted the party chief and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal

 Without your (arvind Kejriwal) wish nothing happens there, it is quite difficult to survive in the party by disagreeing with you
 saath hi vishwaas bole ki arvind ne kaha tha maarenge par shahid nahin hone denge
 Argument Kejriwal and other party leaders apologized in defamation cases recently
 lekin kumaar vishwaas ne is baat kaa khule taur par virodh kiya tha
 After which Kumar Vishwas said that he will not apologize and will fight the case alone
 gauratlab he ki naa sirf rajyasabha chunaav balki kai anya maamalon main bhi kumaar vishwaas ko lekar party main virodhabhas kii sthiti bani thi
 There were different opinions between Vishwas and Kejriwal on many issues
