 england ke simit overon kii team ke captain eon morgan ko i-rickshaw ne khaasaa prabhavit kiya he
 Morgan, who arrived in Kanpur city of UP for the first T20 match against India, could not leave the temptation to roam in it
 yah baat alag he ki suraksha kaarnon ke chalate ve hotel parisar main hi yah kar paae
 The first match of the T20 series between India and England is to be held in Green Park on Thursday
 bharat or england kii timen jis hotel main thahari hai uske prabandh nideshak vikaas malhotra ne bataaya, ‘england ke captain morgan ne mangalvaar ko green park main abhyaas satr ke baad waapas hotel lautate samay sadak par i-rickshaw dekhe to unhone mobile se unki photo khinch lee
 After coming to the hotel, he asked the hotel management about it and expressed his desire to roam the market on an e-rickshaw
 malhotra ke anusaar, ‘hamane england ke captain kii is khwaahish ke bare main police prashasan ko bataaya, lekin suraksha kaarnon se morgan ko i-rickshaw main bazaar jane kii ijaajat nahin mili
 Later, with the consent of the police and hotel management, it was decided to turn Morgan into an e-rickshaw in the hotel premises itself
 ’ hotel prabandhan ne morgan ke liye ek i-rickshaw sadak kaa intjaam kiya
 He still wanted to sit in it and go to the market but he was not allowed by the police
 malhotra ne bataaya, ‘aakhir main hotel parisar puri tarah se khaali karaayaa gaya or police suraksha badhaai gai
 Morgan also appeared enthusiastic about riding in an e-rickshaw
 unhone i-rickshaw main baithkar hotel parisar ke do chakkar lagaae or baad main apane kamare main chale gaye
 He thanked the hotel management and police officers for arranging the arrangements
 ’ england ke anya khilaadiyon ko kanpur main chamade se bana saamaan kaaphi pasand aayaa or unhone police suraksha main bazaar jaakar kharidari kii
 On the other hand, the Indian team thought it appropriate to stay in the hotel and spent time in the gym and swimming pool

 argedy adhyaksh lalu prasad yadav ne pradhanmantri narendra modi ko ek baar phir khat likhaa he
 In the letter, he has tried to make the Modi government stand in the dock
 lalu ne khat main gujarat ke oona main dalit yuvakon ke saath marpet ke liye bijepi or aresas ko jimmedaar tehraaya he
 At the same time, he has questioned the silence of the PM on the crime happening in the country in the name of cow protection
 lalu kaa piem narendra modi ko likhaa khat:aadarneey modiji,main puri vinamrata se aapkaa dhyaan aapke grih rajya gujarat main ahmedabad se 360 kilometre dur una main ghatit hui us durbhagyapurna ghatana kii ore le janaa chaahunga, jiske bare main sansad main khadey hokar grahamantrirajnath singhji ne kaha ki aapako is ghatana se gaharaa dukh pahunchaa he
 Yes, i am referring to the same incident in which four Dalit youths belonging to the leather industry were brutally beaten brutally in public only because they had stripped the skin of dead cows for their livelihood
 yah jo gau-seva or gau raksha ke naam par kukuramutton kii tarah jagah-jagah hinsak tathakthith gau-rakshak dal ityadi punap rahe hai, is aag ke peeche sabase bada haath aresas or aapkaa hi he
 In the first Lok Sabha elections and in the recently held Bihar Assembly elections, the irresponsibility of which provocative speeches were made on the non-essential things like pink revolution, cow meat, cow rearers and cow eaters etc
 is the effect that Today, the farmer is also afraid of buying and carrying cows in the car
 jane raste main koun unhen gau raksha ke naam par gherkar peet de yaa jaan hi le le
 You divided the people, planted poison, cultivated a lot of votes and became what they wanted
 lekin aapkaa boyaa jehar rah-rah jativaadee or sampradayik saanp kaa rup dhar, samay-samay par unmaadi fan uthaata he or desh kii shanti or sauhaard ko das kar chalaa jaataa he, mujhe atyant dukh he ki mujhe apane desh kepradhanmantrico yah bataanaa pad rahaa he ki yah aag aapaki hi lagaai hui he
 The only cow, your party and the mother of your intolerant ideology, is guilty of the cowherds, peasant brothers, Dalits, Adivasis and minorities dying in this fire
 agar aaj main aapako kathghare main khadaa nahin karuunga to mere andar kaa gau-paalak mujhe kabhi maaf nahin karegaa
 The foreign media including the whole country also knew that Lalu Yadav is a public servant associated with land and poor in India, who keeps cow-mother in the bungalows of Lutyens Delhi and also in the Chief Minister's residence
 mere dwaara dilli ke bangale mengay rakhane par mujhe jativaadiyon dwaara gwalaor guar kaha gaya, main dikhaane ke liye gaay nahin rakhata, jab kuch nahin the tab bhi gaay rakhte the or aaj bhi rakhte hai
 Even today, perhaps not all BJP leaders will have as many cows as we have in our house and khatal (gaushala)
 gaay ke naam par logon ko baantne vaale netaaon kaa gau-seva se kya sarokaar? aapke jambo mantrimandal ke 78 mantri lutyens dilli ke bade-bade bangalon main rahete hai
 How many have cows reared in their bungalows? Dogs must be kept
 lekin gaayon ke naam par naak-bhun sikodenge kyonki unka tathakthith hai class stats unhen isaki anumati nahin degaa! bihar main aapane gau-prem par sabhaaon main bade-bade lacture or akhabaaron main karodon ke ishtehaar die the
 Modiji, if you really love cow, then you should make a rule for every minister that everyone will get cow in their bungalows
 khud apane haathon se unki dekhbhaal karegaa, unhen nahalaayegaa, khilaaegaa or mrityu hone par unka vidhivat antim sanskaar bhi karegaa, taaki mrit gaayon ko unke bangalon se le jate vakt aap hi ke kaaryakarta un daliton yaa pichhadon kii hatya naa kar de
 The incident of Una is not unique or the only incident in itself, this madness shows its orgy in some corner of the country and you face the other side
 aap log to vot kii raajnneeti karke chale jate hai par garib iskaa bhugtan apni aay, khushiyon, sambhaavnaaon or jivan se karte hai
 In the name of cow protection, the Manuvadis use it to recapture the autocracy slowly slipping from their hands, to show the Dalits backward their 'place'
 desh bhar main gaayen sadakon ke kinare kachra khaati hai, par koi gaay premi use do rotiyaan nahin khilaaegaa
 These cows succumb to hunger, thirst, heat, disease, but no cow guard will come to take care of it
 par gau maance par kisi akhlaaq kii hatya karne ko puraa gaanv hi nahin, aasapaas ke gaanv ke bhaajapa kaaryakarta bhi jute jate hai
 In the same way, you get involved in elections to do politics on the cow
 ab sangh or bhaajapa kaa yah swang band hona chahie
 Now the country does not tolerate that the Prime Minister's heart will awaken after a week on the institutionalized murder of Rohit Vemula, the 'child of Mother Bharti'
 desh ke dalit or pichde sangh kii thopi hui aachaar samhita ko maanane se inkaar karte hai
 Through their protests and demonstrations, Dalits have made the government of Gujarat realize their importance, show a mirror to the society and show only a glimpse of the bitterness within them
 pradhanmantri ji, brahmanvaadi or manuaadi maansikta ko pichley daravaaje se ham dalit, pichde or adivaasiyon par punah ladane kaa prayaas band kiijie, varanaa iskaa parinaam desh ke liye vidhvansak hoga
 The majority class of the country will not allow the repetition of a black social structure lasting thousands of years in the country at any cost

 upi main sarkari gaushalaon main band saikadongay-belon kii maut ne sabhi kaa dhyaan khinchaa he
 According to sources, the main reason for the death of cows is the maladjustment present in these gaushalas
 baharhaal, gaushalaon main gaayon kii maut kii soochna milane kaa baad upi ke siem yogi adityanath ne aath afasaron ko suspend kar diya he
 Also, orders have been given to improve the arrangements in these gaushalas
 afasaron par siem kii karrwai ke baad bhi gaayon ke marane kaa silsilaa jari he
 Some people are telling the number of cows dying in hundreds
 lekin sarkaar ne abhi to koi aankada pesh nahin kiya
 It is alleged that all these cows have died due to lack of fodder and dirt
 bataa den ki gaayon kii maut se itnaa hangaam isliye machaa he kyonki upi sarkaar ne apane bajet main gau seva ke liye kareeb 600 karod rupee kaa fund aavantit kiya tha
 Despite this, most of the cows are losing their lives due to bad faith
 NDTV ne upi ke ayodhya or mirzapur samet kai anyagaushalaon kaa daura kiya jahaan se gaayon kii maut kii khabar aa rahi thi
 Sibsagar Dubey, Tehsildar of Ballia, told NDTV that four calves have died in front of me
 or inaki maut kii vajah ko kai beemaari ho aisa nahin lag rahaa he
 Seeing them, it is clear that he died due to lack of fodder
 bataa den ki rajya sarkaar ne apane bajet main gaayon kii dekhbhaal or rakrakhaav ke liye baari bajet kaa elaan kiya tha
 a total of Rs 600 crore was allocated by the UP government for cow protection in the 2019-20 budget
 is rakam main se 250 karod rupee gaanvon main jabaki 200 karod rupee shaharon main bane gaushalaon par kharch hone kii baat kahi thi
 At the same time, an amount of Rs 165 crore was to be spent for the protection of the cows
 lekin in sab ke baavjood bhi gaayon kii mautein ho rahi hai
 And the arrangements at the ground level are inadequate
 lakhanu se lage barabanki sthit ek gaushala main pichley hafte hi aath gaymer gayi
 The administration is giving the reason for the death of these cows due to their old age, while the cows caretakers say that the death of the cows is due to poor fodder
 unka kahana he kiin gaayon ko bhuse ke alaava khaane main kuch bhi nahin miltaa he
 Due to which more cows living here are getting weaker and later they are dying
 gaayon kii dekhbhaal karne vaale yuvak ne NDTV ko bataaya ki yahaan rahane vaali ek gaay ko har din paanch kilo bhusa, ek kilo chokar, ek kilo sarson kii khali, aadha kilo binaul or paanch kilo haraa chaara milanaa chahie
 But they only get straw
 barabanki or sobhadra sthit gaushalaon ke care tekar dayaram se NDTV ne gaayon kii haalat ko lekar khaas baat kii
 
 
 At the same time, the condition of Sonbhadra's gaushalas is also similar
 yahaan beete paanch maheenon main kareeb 124 gaay-belon kii maut ho chuki he
 The hastily built gaushalas do not even have sheds at all
 jahaan hai wo kaaphi chote hai
 Yogesh Kushwaha, the caretaker of a gaushala in Sonbhadra, spoke to NDTV
 gaushalaon main gaayon kii maut ko lekar siem yogi adityanath ne aath logon ko suspend bhale kar diya ho lekin unki party ke ek vidhayak unase ittefaq nahin rakhte hai
 They say that all cows that have died are dead due to their age
 bijepi vidhayak ajay sih ke anusaar beete kuch dinon main jitani bhi gaayen mari hai unki maut kii mukhya vajah unki umr thi
 i think things are being misrepresented

 Amid criticism from various sections over the proposal related to EPF in the budget, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley today announced the withdrawal of the controversial proposal to tax the withdrawal of funds from the Employees Provident Fund
 jetali ne 2016-17 ke bajet prastaav main ek april 2016 ke baad karmchaaree bhavishya nidhi kii kul raashi ke60 pratishat nikaalane par kar lagane kii baat kahi thi
 The proposal was criticized by various employee organizations and political parties
 arun jetali ne swat: sangyaan liyavitt mantri arun jetali ne aaj loksabhaa main swat: sangyaan lete hue diye apane bayaan main kaha, ‘hamen mili kai gyapanon ke maddenjar sarkaar is prastaav kii samgr samiksha karnaa chaahati he or isliye isprastaav ko wapasleti he
 He, however, said that there will be a 40 per cent exemption at the time of withdrawal of funds to people associated with the National Pension Scheme
 apane bajet prastaav main jetali ne prastaav kiya tha ki ipief kii 40 pratishat raashi nikaalnaa kar mukt hoga or shesh 60 raashi bhi isi shrenee main aayegi agar use pension yojana main nivesh kiya jaataa he
 The proposal was criticized in the budget by various political parties and employees' unions and said that it was a matter forcing employees to invest in the pension scheme
 karadhaan prastaav kaa auchity bataate hue jetali ne kaha, ‘karmchaariyon ke paas yah vikalp hona chahie ki ve kahaan nivesh karen
 Theoretically such freedom is mandatory but it is also important for the government to achieve the objective related to taxation
 ’unhone kaha ki vartmaan swaroop main nitigat uddeshy adhik rajasav praapt karnaa nahin balki logon ko pension yojana main shaamil hone ke liye protsaahit karnaa he
 3 of the Employees Provident Fund Organization
 7 karod upabhokta hai

 26 karod ipiefo upabhoktaaon par prabhaav nahin padegaa
 Rahul said, 'my pressure came to work' After the government announced the withdrawal of the proposal to take interest on EPF, Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi said that the pressure he and his party put on the government came to fruition
 "my pressure did work," says Rahul Gandhi in Parliament on withdrawal of tax on EPF— ANI (@ani_news)march 8, 2016 Whatever results come on May 23, the status report of Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar is ready - his stature has been reduced
 68 varshiya nitish kumaar ko lagaataar saajheedaar badalte rahane kii vajah se bhartiya raajnneeti main behad kamatar mana jane laga he
 Even though he is still the Chief Minister of Bihar, but his extinguished face on the same stage with PM Modi at the end of last month showed his condition
 nitish ne 'bharat mata kii jai' ke naare nahin lagaae or manch par khamosh baithe rahe
 In PM Modi's Bihar rally, Nitish Kumar remained seated while the others kept shouting slogans of Vande Mataram
 nitish apane bhavashunya chehre par garv karte hai
 Once during a TV interview at the Chief Minister's residence in Patna, i had to stop him and say that there was a lack of punch in his responses
 nitish turant hi samaj gaye or bole 'dobaaraa shoot karte hai' lekin ye bhi kaha ki main duusare bihari rajanetaaon kii tarah nahin hum, jo hansi thitholi karte hai
 His reference was towards Lalu Yadav, who is known for his punchlines and who was his partner in politics and sometimes an enemy
 is tippanee se ye bhi pataa chalata he ki kaise nitish hameshaa khud ko apane pratidwandiyon se alag rakhte hai
 His biggest rival at that time was Narendra Modi as the Chief Minister of Gujarat
 2015 main kumaar ne lalu ke saath pratidwandita ko khatm karte hue unke or congress ke saath gathbandhan kar liya
 In 2017, he joined the bjp-led NDA
 bihar main antim charan ke matdaan se pehle somvaar ko jari ek khule khat main lalu ne unhen 'avasarwaadi' qaraar diya he
 This is an allegation on which many people will not disagree
 modi or shah ke saath samjhaute kii vajah se bhale hi nitish bhrashtachar ke aaropon se ghire yadav kunbe ko maat dene main kaamyaab hue hon, lekin iske saath hi unhone pradhanmantri banane kii apni mahatvakanksha jise wo dashakon tak paalate rahe, ko bhi tilanjali de di
 Till then Nitish Kumar was considered to be such a contender for the post of Prime Minister in the opposition which everyone would have agreed to
 lekin ab wo bijepi ke kai sahyogiyon main se ek hai
 Amit Shah, who is considered to be the toughest bargainer in Indian politics, may have left 17 seats as much as BJP for Nitish, but it is only for political gains and not a reflection of Nitish Kumar's enhanced status in the NDA 
 lalu kii party ke ek netaa kehete hai, ''nitish bihar main apana rutaba kho chuke hai
 Now he does not even have that domineering image, which is very important in the politics of Bihar
 '' unhone kaha, ''lalu ko sajishan jail main daalkar chunaav ladane se roka gaya he lekin aashcharya he ki vah ab bhi dabang hai
 People also know that Nitish has lost his battle with Modi
 or matadaata haare hue logon ko pasand nahin karata
 Nitish Kumar, who hails from the Kurmi caste, which has a 4 per cent share in Bihar's complex caste equation, has for years been the pivot of politicians like Yadav, who have a large ethnic base
 satta ke liye apni sari kalabaziyon main kumaar ko bhrashtachar ke viruddh eemaandaar raajnneetijna kii apni chhavi dhoomil hoti nahin dikhi
 His image of diligent good governance Babu, which ended Lalu Yadav's 'jungle Raj', made a place for him that his immoral actions for power also got a favorable interpretation
 haalanki is baar unki is saumy chhavi ko dhakka laga he
 Especially Lalu's son Tejashwi Yadav, with great agility in big rallies, targets him with laughter and calls him 'chacha'
 2016 main nitish kumaar ne rajya main sharaab par pratibandh laga diya jo shaayad gujarat se prerit tha or sambhavat: galat faisla rahaa
 Nitish's assessment was that this would enable women voters from across the state to join their Kurmi support base
 haalanki hakeekat kuch or he
 Due to prohibition, the black liquor business flourished and police stations became supply centers across the state
 nitish sharaab mafia par lagaam nahin laga sake
 The image of Nitish's good administrator got a big shock when many people of his own party were found to be indulging in black marketing of liquor
 bihar main nitish kii keemat par bijepi aage badi he
 Kumar felt that he was dealing with the BJP of LK Advani's time which he liked, but now he finds himself in front of Amit Shah who is a very skilled politician
 avishwasaneey rup se unhone ek baar phir paala badalane kii sochi or bijepi ke saath siton ke samjhaute se pehle vipaksh ko ek sandesh diya
 The Congress was somewhat sympathetic to him, but the Yadav family flatly refused to reconnect
 unke jaise vyakti ke liye jo apni chhavi ko lekar behad satark rahete hai, unke netritv kaa makhul udana nishchit rup se unke liye kshtdaayi he
 No wonder his face looks so extinguished

 But Pankaj Singh cannot be comforted by this realization
 darasal, england main southampton agiyas boul main england ke khilaaf bharat ke tisare test match main debyue karne se pehle unki raaton kii neend udi hui thi
 On the morning of the Test match, Sourav Ganguly tried to allay his nervousness when giving India's 6-foot-5-inch bowler India's cap, "don't take too much load, enjoy your first Test
" ”pankaj kii 13veen gend elestare cook kii takadir badalane vaali sabit hui, short of length gend cook ke balle ko chooti hui nikal gai
 The ball went to Ravindra Jadeja, playing with the left hand standing in the third slip, bounced to his knees and came in his hand
 lekin ye kya, gend haath se chhitak gai
 That is, the catch has leaked
 jadeja se kaich chhot jane kii ghatana ne 1990 main lodrs main kiran more se graham gooch kaa kaich chhot jane kaa kissa yaad dilaa diya
 Gooch was then playing at 36, but after missing the catch, he scored 333 runs in that innings
 cook itane ran to nahin bana paae lekin kaich chhootane par 15 par khel rahe cook ne jeevandaan ke baad 95 par hi jaakar dam liya
 At that time he was going through a bad career, but after scoring 95 runs, his place in the team definitely got stronger
 jahaan tak sawaal england kaa he to yah kaich chhootane ke baad england par bana vah dabaav kam ho gaya, jo match ke pehle ghante tak bhartiya team banaae hue thi
 India not only lost the match but also lost the important edge it was getting in the series
 or bharat ke 282wein test cap pankaj ek bada mauka kho baithe
 By the start of the fourth Test in this series, India had lost eight chances behind the wicket
 lodrs main duusare match ke dauraan gairi bailance 28 par batting kar rahe the jab na mahendra singh dhoni, na hi fasrt slip par khadey shekhar dhawan kaich le paae
 The result was that the balance scored a century
 bharat ne antat match to jeet hi liya lekin fielding kii khamiyaan jag jaahir ho gayi
 Regarding Jadeja in the slip, former all-rounder Kapil Dev says, "the wrong fielder in the wrong place
 aapane kabhi janti rods ko slips par dekha he? ve hamaari peedi ke sabase badhibia fielder ho sakate hai lekin yuvaraj singh, jadeja or yahaan tak ki kohli bhi kaaphi furtile hai
 Fielding in the circle or outfield, he intends to run away and grab the ball
 lekin slip main yah takanic kaamyaab nahin rahati kyonki aapako gend ko aaraam se apane haath main aane dena hota he
 i feel sorry for Pankaj
 vah kaich unhone le liya hota to ve or wicket le sakate the
 India's performance could have been better
 us ek kshan kii baari keemat hamen chukaani padi
 "there is also a truth that after fielding Rahul Dravid and VVS Laxman, India's fielding has not been able to recover
 in donon silp fielderon kaa kramshah 210 or 135 test kaich kaa record he
 The team has tried five players in the first slip - Dravid used to have a lot of fielding here
 takreeban 10 khiladinnon ko slip carden main aajamaaya ja chukaa he lekin khamiyaan hai ki khatm hone kaa naam nahin le rahi hai
 Recall the Auckland Test earlier this year when the New Zealand team had lost 3 wickets for 30 runs and Kane was dropped by Mohammed Shami off Murali Vijay's hand
 ken ne 113 ran banaae or chauthe wicket main brendan makkulam ke saath 221 ran jod die

 bharat ke kshetrarakshan main kai takneekee khamiyaan hai, jis vajah se pehle se kamjor gendbaaji par or bhaar pad jaataa he
 These are the drawbacks — not grooming specialists and trying out many fielders, unbalanced body positions, incorrect posture of hands, and in many cases a lack of slip temperament
 misaal ke taur par is siries main nae slip fielderon ko apane haathon ko ghutane par rakhe dekha gaya (is pojishan ko ian botham ne lokapriy banaaya lekin koi isaki nakal nahin kar sakaa)
 The most surprising thing is the distance between the slip - or say its lack

 Actually Dhawan was standing far behind and the ball fell a few inches before him

 Mohammad Azharuddin, who is famous for diving and catching such catches, says, "you have to guess and turn a catch in a blink of an eye
" is tarah ke kaich lapaknaa team kaa manobal badhaane kaa sabase acha tarika he
 "laxman's fielding mantra is," soft hands and cool mind
 ” ve kehete hai, “jab saurav captain or jon rhite coach the to unhone mujhase, dravid or sachin tendulkar se slips kii rakhwali ko kaha tha
 We practiced only at slip and understood our responsibilities well
 sachin pehle, main duusare or dravid tisare slip par hote the, lekin jab sachin kii ungali main chot lag gai to sachin slip se baahar ho gaye
 In such a situation, Rahul remained on first, i remained on second and Virender Sehwag came at third slip
 hamaara ek tarika tha, ham 3 se 4 second tak gend par najar rakhte or baaki vakt ek duusare se baaten karte the
 This would have helped us to maintain our concentration for a long time
 ”bharat ko videshon main mili kamyaabi ke peeche slip kii majboot gherebandi kaa bhi ahm yogadan rahaa he

 Singh, Munaf Patel, s
 srisanth kaa naam liya ja saktaa he) or spinner anil kumble ko vah sahyog mil jaataa tha, jisaki unhen jarurat thi

 Other than that and won many matches
 bharat ke sabase safal captain ganguli kehete hai, “slip main fielding majboot nahin hoti to ham yah jeet hasil nahin kar pate
 He made our fast bowling more effective
 ”yaaddasht ke saath anubhav bhi bahut jaruri hota he
 After being hit by the bat, the ball comes to slip at such a fast speed that the fielder needs to know all the nuances of the ball's direction in order for the ball to jump from the right side
 saath hi sooyeeboojh or turant faisla lene kii kshamta
 The secret to the success of great bowlers is that they got the right players at the first slip
 asal main test cricket main to gendbaaj or slip fielder kii jodi kii mahatvapurn bhoomika hoti he
 Think about the pairings of Anil kumble-dravid, Shane warne-mark Waugh, kapil-gavaskar, muralitharan-mahela Jayawardene
 yah bhi hairat kii baat he ki slip main bharat kii khamiyaan saaf najar aa rahi hai, khaskar tab jab aadhunik cricket kii maang kii vajah se behatar fielding standard ban gaye hai
 Says Kapil, “earlier Indian players were average fielders but took good catches, now the situation is the opposite
 kaaphi sankhya main ekadivasiy or tii-20 maichon se ve achche fielder to ban gaye hai lekin jahaan tak main samajhta hum ve slip kaiching kii practice nahin karte kyonki ekadivasiy or tii-20 maichon main slip kaa istemaal kabhi-kabhaar hi hota he
 As i and Azhar used to do in our time — today's slip fielders must take at least 100 catches during practice
 anyathaa aap ek test main 20 wicket kaise lenge?”ab tak unhone jo dekha he, uske aadhaar par ganguli kehete hai ki sudhaar kaa ekmaatr yahi tarika he ki teen-chaar slip fielderon kii pahchaan kii jaae or ek saal tak abhyaas karavaaya jaae
 They should understand that they have to stand in the slip
 unhen kai tarah se abhyaas karnaa he
 The ball has to be tested from every possible angle
 yadi bharat slip kaich chodta rahaa to gendbaaji ko or jhtka lagegaa
 "mahendra Singh Dhoni must think about this

 hamen chatur bananaa hoga or achche faisle karne honge
 It will be the responsibility of the player
 kisi ko bhi koi nirnay lene ke liye majaboor nahin kiya jayega
 However, Kohli also said that this season has been very busy for the Indian team but the team is full of confidence and the players are entitled to enjoy the IPL
 kohli bole- world cap ke antim-11 ke liye ab bhi ek jagah khaliunhone kaha, 'lambey samay tak khelte rahane kaa asar padataa he
 i am not using this as an excuse because in every match you play as a team you are expected to win
 jab lanbaa satr hota he to aap us par vichaar karte hai
 It has been a very busy session

 RIP
 - Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) July 20, 2016 Shahid died on Wednesday in a hospital in Gurgaon
 vah 56 saal ke the or kaaphi samay se kidney or liver kii pareshaani se jujh rahe the
 Hockey legend Shahid was part of the Indian team that won the gold medal at the Moscow Olympics in 1980
 pilia or dengue kii vajah se unki tabiyat or kharaab ho gai thi
 Earlier this month, he was admitted to a hospital in Gurgaon from Varanasi
 dur he manzil, raahen mushkil / alam he tanhai kounki shakhsiyat ko sabase zyada gande vaala pahalu begum akhtar kaa sangeet hi tha
 At the same time, his music was shaped by the journey of his life
 itnaa zyada ki unki jindagi or sangeet ko alag kar paanaa mumkin nahin he
 His journey started in Kishorevay from a colony in Lucknow, which was set up by his brother-in-law Mushtari Bai, who was himself a tawaif
 akhtari ne bahut kam vakt main apane dam par kalakaar kaa darja hasil kar liya
 Only very well known people were allowed to come to their courts
 megaphone ke binar tale unka 78 arempi recording kaa ek number aayaa or dekhte hi dekhte ve puure uttar bharat main lokapriy ho gayi
 She went through many creative periods of her career at a very young age
 isamen 1920 ke dashak main kalakatta main rangamanch par adaakaari bhi shaamil he
 He mostly played the character of 'vamp' ('in black velvet western attire and smoked cigarette with long black holder')
 unhone kuch vannt filmon main bhi adaakaari kii or gane gaae (sabase zyada unhen mahaj ek thumari ke liye yaad kiya jaataa he jo unhone satyajit raay kii jalsaghar main gaai thi)
 In search of social acceptance and longing for the married life of a 'mainstream housewife', she became a 'good mother' and then finally Begum who ruled the world of Ghazal singing for decades
 in saare badlaavon se guzarate hue takalif or udaasi unki jindagi ke saath lagaataar vabsta rahi
 The thing that started with his difficult childhood became a habit in later years
 is had tak ki unke mureedon kii jubaani agar gam or udaasi na ho to ve baichaiyn mahasoos karne lagati thim
 Perhaps this was the reason why the poetry he chose for his chosen fun of musical expression was Ghazal
 is fan ko unhone ek nai aawaaj di, ek aisi sangitatmakataa jo unki apni or anuthi thi, jise baad ke varshon main kai dusron ne apanaaya
 Famous Urdu poets of that time — Jigar Muradabadi, Kaifi Azmi and Shakeel Badauni — wrote for him and he had close friendships with many of them
 haalanki jane-maane barrister ishtiya ahamed abbasi ke saath unka nikaah unki saarvajanik gayaki par kai paabandiyaan lekar aayaa, magar duusari taraf isi kii vajah se ve urdu shaayari ke or kareeb aa gayi
 However, some of his reasons were also due to his scholarship
 (lekhika musician hai) On 16th of November, when the Ministry of Commerce presented the country's trade figures for October 2015, the exporters realized the real problems
 kuch-kuch 2008-09 kii tarah, jab vaishvik mandi kii vajah se desh ke niryaat main lagaataar nau maheenon tak giravat ai thi
 This time too, in October, exports have fallen 18 per cent compared to a year ago
 niryaat main giravat kaa yah lagaataar gyarahavaan maheenaa tha
 This time too, the slowing down of the global economy can be attributed to this, but there are many other aspects of concern for exporters
 inamen ek niryaat ke mulyon main giravat he jo kai maamalon main kaaphi zyada he
 There are basically three product groups for India — petrochemical products, diamonds and jewelry and agricultural products
 ye teenon hamaare kul niryaat kaa 45 fisadi hai
 Exports of petroleum products declined by 54 per cent in October to a mere Rs 16,000 crore
 mulya kaa rah gaya
 This reflects sluggish demand from commodity exporters due to the fall in the price of crude oil in the global market
 heere or jevaraat ke niryaat main saal dar saal 13 fisadi giravat hui kyonki europea upabhoktaaon kii maang main susti thi
 At the same time, rice exports fell by 37 per cent due to the decrease in price in the global market
 niti nirmaataaon ke liye raahat kii ekmaatr baat yah he ki aayaat main bhi kami ai he jisase aayaat or niryaat ke mulyon ke bich kaa antar yani vyapaar ghaataa chaalu vitt varsh main april se aktubar ke bich 77
 It is only 76 billion dollars
 yah pichley vittiya varsh kii isi avadhi main rahe 86
 Much less than $ 26 billion
 bharat se europe ko niryaat main 11 fisadi kii kami ai jabaki america ko hone vaale niryaat main 3
 There was a decrease of 8 percent
 isaki mukhya vajah tel utpaadon ke mulyon or kapadaa niryaat main ai giravat he
 As a result, India can not only fail to meet its export target for the year 2015-16 but also miss the target of growth rate of over 8 per cent
 isse menuphaccharing kshetra main jaan foonkane ke liye chede gaye 'mek in india' abhiyaan par bhi sawaal khadey hote hai or ek aise desh kii kamajoriyaan rekhaankit hoti hai jiske zyaadaatar udyog vaishvik pratispardhaa main kaaphi peeche hai
 Ajay Sahai, director general of the Federation of Indian Export Organizations, says, "the most worrying thing is that India's exports fell by more than 17 per cent for several consecutive months
 yah giravat china kii tulana main kahin zyada tikhi thi
 China held it at five per cent
 '' unka kahana he ki isaki vajah niryaat ke liye moolyavardhit vastuon par china kaa focus he
 Conversely, India's emphasis is on commodities in which uncertainty in the price of raw materials can adversely affect exports
 china ne apni niryaat pratispardhaa se vaishvik vyapaar main kis tarah jagah banaai he, iskaa sabase acha udhaaharan bharat ke saath uske vyapaar sameekaran main aayaa badlaav he
 Trade deficit between the two countries 1 in 2004-05

 indira gandhi institute of deveopment research main professor ashima goyal kahati hai, ''maujuuda susti ke liye vaishvik str par camodity keemton main lagane vaala jhatka jimmedaar he
 This led to a drop in demand
 par hakeekat yah he ki hamaare niryaat kii vruddhi dar main giravat ubharate bazaaron main sabase zyada he
 We are in the worst condition after Russia, Colombia and Peru
 ''ek anya ahm kaarak yah he ki haalia avadhi main yah teesraa jhatka he
 Goyal says, "exporters are getting jerks again and again
 '' vaishvik mandi ke baad teji se recovery ho gai thi par 2011 ke euro rin sankat ne bhi hamaare niryaat par asar daalaa
 Then there was recovery from diversity in export destinations
 ab yah maujuuda sankat hamaare saamne he
 Sahai says that at this rate, India will fall far behind its $ 325 billion export target for 2015-16, as only $ 155 billion has been earned in the last seven months
 gitanjali samooh ke prabandh nideshak mehul chekasi kehete hai ki maujuuda susti ek saal tak kaayam rah sakati he
 "for geopolitical reasons, the non-us market for diamonds and jewelry, which accounts for about 60 per cent of the region, has fallen by 25 per cent, while the US market growth has been just two to three per cent," he says
 '' sarkaar ko kachche maal kii aapurti main sudhaar karne ke liye sone ke aayaat se paabandiyon ko or kam karnaa chahie
 The current decline in exports is very sharp and may continue till the first quarter of the next financial year

 The prices of metals, commodities and agricultural products have reached record lows

 a recent pact between the US, Japan and 10 other countries of the Pacific - Trans Pacific Partnership could further hurt India's exports, particularly in textile and leather products

 In comparison, interest rates in Southeast Asia are only around 5 to 6 percent
 doosraa masalaa len-dein kii ucch laagat he
 This is the cost of dealing with government processes
 isamen companiyaan 15 se 25 arab dollar ke bich kharch kar detii hai, jabaki kul niryaat hi kareeb 300 arab dollar he
 Sahay says, "if the government simplifies the process with IT connectivity, it reduces the cost of transactions even by 50%
 There will be a lot of benefit" Some people say that to tackle this problem, nurturing entrepreneurs And competition will have to improve
 jawaharlal nehru vishvavidhyalay ke professor biswajit dhar kehete hai ki kapadaa or rasayan jaise kuch kshetron main sudhaar dekha gaya he or use aage badhaane kii jarurat he
 The machine tool and industrial machinery sectors have also protected themselves from sluggish exports
 ve kehete hai, ''sarkaar ko behatar pradarshan karne vaale kshetron ko madad kerani chahie
 The government says it is taking steps to increase exports
 kendriya vaanijya or udyog mantri nirmala sitaraman kaa kahana he, ''niryaat main mulya ke sandarbh main giravat ho rahi he
 We are trying to take steps that will make our exports competitive
 '' unka maananaa he ki niryaatkon ko 3 fisadi kii byaaj sabsidi dene kaa haalia kadam madadgaar sabit hoga
 Another thing being said is that the recent trade agreements that India has entered into with other countries, including the South Asia Free Trade Agreement, have not yielded the desired results
 goyal kahati hai, ''gharelu baadhaon ko dur kiye bina nae samjhauton kaa bhi koi laabh nahin milegaa
 For example, India's pre-container trade costs were more than double the average cost of East Asia in 2014
 alpavadhi main bharat ko america or europe par zyada dhyaan kendrit chahie jahaan thodaa sudhaar najar aa rahaa he or dirghakaal main apane vyapaar main vividhta laane, vyapaar laagat kam karne or niryaatkon ke liye suvidhaayen badhaane par jor dena chahie
 Although the rupee has depreciated, the currencies of other countries have depreciated more than that
 is saal april se sitambar ke bich rupaya kareeb 5 fisadi avamoolyit hokar dollar ke mukaable 65
 Reached 74
 agast main china ne apni mudra ke avamulyan ke liye kai kadam uthaae or niryaatkon kii madad ke liye dollar ke mukaable yuan ko girane diya
 This also showed signs of waging a monetary war in the world
 goyal kaa kahana he, ''rupee ko pratispardhi bane rahanaa chahie par zyada avamulyan se asthirataa paidaa ho sakati he or ayaatkon kii laagat bad sakati he
 Higher currency fluctuations only hurt exporters
 ''bharat ko agar niryaat ko lekar utsaahi deshon kii badi fehrist main shaamil hona he or 'mek in india' ke jariye dohare ankon kii vikaas dar ko phir se hasil karnaa he to vah niryaat main maujuuda giravat ko nazarandaaj karne kaa jokhim nahin uthaa saktaa

 Politics in India has intensified after China's imposition of jaish-e-mohammed leader Maulana Masood Azhar as a global terrorist
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne pradhanmantri narendra modi par sidhaa hamalaa bolaa he, jiskaa jawaab bhartiya janata party ne bhi tikhe tewaron main diya he
 BJP has tweeted that today China is not a part of UNSC if your Great Grandfather does not give this seat to China
 bijepi kii ore se twit kiya gaya he ki bharat abhi tak aapke parivaar ke dwaara kii gai galatiyon ko hi bhugat rahaa he
 You must understand that India will continue to win the war against terrorism
 ye sab aap pradhanmantri narendra modi par chhod dijie, jabatak aap chini samakakshon se chori-chupe milte rahiye
 China wouldn't be in UNSC had your great grandfather not 'gifted' it to them at India's cost
 India is undoing all mistakes of your family
 Be assured that India will win the fight against terror
 Leave it to PM Modi while you keep cosying up with the Chinese envoys secretly
 https: / / t
 co / layp12cxbd— BJP (@bjp4india)march 14, 2019aapako bataa den ki congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne guuruuvaar subah hi twit kar likhaa tha ki pradhanmantri narendra modi china ke raashtrapati shi jinping se dar gaye hai or china jab bhi bharat ke khilaaf kuch galat kadam uthaata he to pradhanmantri narendra modi chuppi saadh lete hai
 Rahul Gandhi wrote that Prime Minister Modi, along with Jinping, swinged a swing in Gujarat, hugged him in Delhi and bowed his head in front of him in China
 rahul gandhi se pehle congress ke anya pravaktaa bhi modi sarkaar par sidhaa hamalaa bol rahe hai
 Significantly, in the UN Security Council, China used its veto power to prevent Maulana Masood Azhar from being declared a global terrorist
 china ke dwaara lagaataar chauthi baar aisa kiya gaya he
 India has lodged strict objection to this move of China, while America along with India is also criticizing China

 Budget 2017 is seen as an initiative by the government to deal with the current situation in the country and meet the expectations of the people

 China is working on several plans simultaneously to surround India
 ek taraf ek baar phir china ke raashtrapati chune gaye shi jinping kehete hai ki unki army kaa focus jang jeetne par hona chahie
 At the same time, he told the Tibetan settlement living on the border of India, 'keep the roots to protect the Chinese territory'
 yani china na sirf badi chaalon se balki bharat ke khilaaf choti choti chaale chalakar use maat dene kii koshish kar rahaa he
 In such a situation, Xi Jinping can make China a big threat to India, constantly strengthening in Chinese politics
 vahiin china ne brahmaputra ko lekar nayaa plan taiyaar kiya he
 Chinese engineers have prepared a plan to build a 1000 km long tunnel to divert water of the Brahmaputra
 is tunnel ke jariebrahmaputraka pani tibet se jinjiyang kii taraf modane kii yojana he
 This will affect not only India but also Bangladesh
 honkong ke akhbaar 'south china morning post' ne khabar di he ki is kadam se 'shinjiyang ke california main tabdeel hone' kii ummid he
 The move has caused concern among environmentalists as it could have adverse effects on the Himalayan region
 jaankaree ke mutabik ejiniyaron ne apana plan isi saal march main chini sarkaar ko saunpa tha, lekin ab tak sarkaar kii taraf se ise manjuuri nahin mili he
 China's shepherd policy China has been using shepherds for many years to assert their rights over the Indian region
 arunachal pradesh main charavaahon ko bhej china use apana ilaaka bataata rahaa he
 At the same time, China has once again moved towards this plan
 china ke raashtrapati shi jinping ne tibet ke lunje county ke ek charvaaha parivaar ko likhaa he, ‘kshetra main shanti ke bina, lakhon pariwaron ke liye jivan shantipurna nahin hoga
 This means that China's plan is to claim the shepherd as a citizen by claiming human rights on that border
 is sandesh ke saath china ne charavaahon ke ek parivaar se simavarti kshetra main basti basaane, chini kshetra kii suraksha karne or vahaan par basti kaa vistaar karne ke liye protsaahit kiya he
 Lunje is near Arunachal Pradesh in India, which China claims and calls it Southern Tibet
 yahi nahin china bharat ko sena ke badhati takaton se bhi daraana chahta he
 This is the reason why Xi Jinping, once again the President of China, chose to emphasize the army in its first meeting
 is baithak ke jariye shi jinping ne apni sena ke saath duniyabar ko sandesh bheja ki vah kitni teji se world class sainya shakti banane kii ore agrasar he
 Xi Jinping said in that meeting that we should emphasize on how we can prepare a world class military by 2050
 dobaaraa raashtrapati banane ke baad shi kii ye pehali baithak thi
 Xi himself came to the meeting wearing a military dress
 baithak main unhone kaha tha ki hamen ek aisi sena banani chahie, jo ki CPC kii cmand sunen or yuddh jeetne main sakasham ho
 Let us tell you that Jinping was elected President at the recent conference in China
 unke saath hi 7 logon kii team taiyaar kii gai, jinke haath main mukhya taur par china kii satta kaa daaromadar rahegaa
 One thing is clear from the age of the members of the Politburo elected at the CPC conference that none of these leaders will succeed Xi Jinping

 congress ke liye yah munh maangi muraad se kam nahin he, kyonki modi ko gherne kaa unhen acha avasar mil gaya he
 Two news portals also questioned the role of suspended IAS officer Pradeep Sharma and his elder brother Kuldeep

 After retiring, IPS officer Kuldeep is currently working as a consultant in the Union Ministry of Home Affairs
 bijepi kaa aarope he ki congress ke netritv main upie sarkaar modi sarkaar ke khilaaf farji muthbhed ke jo maamle uthaa rahi thi, usamen kuldeep kaa haath tha
 His younger brother Pradeep Sharma says that he is being targeted because of Kuldeep
 kabhi modi ke kareebi rahe singhl par 2004 main ishrat jahaan maamle main farji muthbhed kaa aarope tha
 He was arrested in February 2013 but was granted bail in June

 They call themselves Lakshmana
 ve kehete hai, ‘‘hamane modi se takkar lene kaa saahas kiya he or ham jaanate hai ki bahut kathin or gaiyr-barabari kii ladaai he, lekin ab peeche hatane kaa sawaal hi nahin he
 If i had any connection with the Congress, i would not be suspended for four years

 "but what Pradeep calls the fight for truth is also political
 unke khilaaf bhrashtachar ke chah maamle darj hai, jinamein zyaadaatar 2005 se 2007 ke bich kuccha or bhavnagar main jameen kaa gaiyr-kanoonee aavanton or keemat kaa kam moolyankan ke maamle shaamil hai
 Two of these cases pertain to unlawful allocation of land to Welspun and Shaw Pipes
 unke khilaaf ye maamle 2009 se 2012 ke bich darj kiye gaye the
 He says, "these cases have been registered with deliberate purpose only to harass me
" ’’ unhone apane khilaaf lagaae gaye maamalon ko khaarij karne ke liye supreme court main apil kii he, jis par faisla aana baaki he
 Encouraged by the controversy over spying of the young woman, Pradeep Sharma has filed a petition in the court on November 23 demanding that the case be investigated by the CBI
 ve kehete hai ki unka makasad ‘‘duniya ko narendra modi kaa asli cheharaa’’ dikhaanaa he
 When Gulel and Cobrapost news portals disclosed the espionage case, they said the same thing
 pradeep kehete hai ki tepon ne unki baat ko sahi sabit kiya he
 He says, "I have always said that Modi was targeting me, because i knew about his relationship with women architects
 ve is maamle main hameshaa khud ko asurakshit mahasoos karte the
 The tapes have proved it
 mere khilaaf pehla maamla darj hone se chah maah pehle hi unhone mujhe jail main daalane kaa faisla kar liya tha, jaisaa ki singhl or amit shah ke bich hone vaali baatcheet se pataa chalata he
 He also says that he was also targeted because of his elder brother
 kuldeep ke khilaaf bhi maamla chal rahaa he, jo 1984 main kuccha main espi ke pad par unki niyukti se sambandhit he
 According to the FIR, some Muslims in the area had disappeared during his tenure
 gujarat hycourt ne is maamle ko khaarij kar diya tha, lekin ab vah maamla supreme court main chal rahaa he
 Five departmental charge sheets were filed against him
 pradeep sharma poochhate hai, ‘‘agar shikayaton main koi dam hota to kya grih mantralay main unhen salaahkaar kaa pad mil saktaa tha
 He says that his brother was targeted because he had taken action against some police officers who had committed fake encounters
 ek samay aisa tha jab sharma bandhuon ko modi or unke vishwaasapaatr amit shah kaa puraa bharosa hasil tha
 Amit Shah was the Home Minister of Gujarat at that time
 gujarat main police upaadheekshak rah chuke divangat en
 N
 sharma ke beton-kuldeep or pradeep ko satta se kareebi ke kaaran jabardast rutaba hasil tha
 Kuldeep came close to Shah in 2003 when he was the head of CID and crime department in the state as an IG
 shah ne disambar 2002 main grih mantralay kaa prabhaar grahan kiya tha
 This relationship was based on appreciation of each other
 tab kuldeep ne shah ke bare main saarvajanik taur par kaha tha, ‘‘maine abhi tak apane jivan main (shah se) zyada budhimaan netaa nahin dekha he
 "on the other hand, Shah was also influenced by Kuldeep's bungling and" eccentric ideas "
 shah ke tahat kuldeep ne jo sabase prashansaneey kaam kiya, vah tha aatanki sanghathanon ke bare main vistrut jaankaree ke saath ek minial taiyaar karnaa, saavdhaaniyaan baratna or sarkaar kii ore se karrwai karnaa
 Kuldeep Sharma's domineering style had troubled many people in the police department
 mana jaataa he ki shah ne modi kii salaah kii bhi andekhi kii
 Modi warned Shah about the "unexpected" attitude of this police officer
 kuldeep or shah ke bich tanaav baduya us vakt shuru hua jab ek maamle main shah ke kareebi bijepi ke ek chote kaaryakarta ke khilaaf kuldeep ne karrwai shuru kii
 The tension reached its peak when Kuldeep wrote to Modi in late 2005 accusing Shah of Rs 1,200 crore
 ke madhupura marcentile bank dhokhadhadi ke maamle main kuch aropiyon ko bachaa rahe hai
 After this, there was complete war between the two
 yah vah samay tha jab gujarat main blackmel karne or dushmani nibhaane ke liye phone tap karnaa, gaiyr-kanoonee tareeke se nigaraanee karnaa or farji sidi bananaa dhadlle se jari tha
 In 2007 IPS officer R
 ke
 Pandian had allegedly shared the phone conversation between Kuldeep and a smuggler who had fled the country
 pandian ab soharabuddin shaikh ke farji muthbhed ke maamle main aaropee hai or pichley dedh saal se jail main band hai
 It was later found that the CD was manipulated
 kuldeep kaa maananaa tha ki shah iske jariye unhen badnaam karnaa chaahate the
 Sources say that after this incident he joined those who destabilized Modi
 udhar, bade bhai or shah ke bich duuri paidaa ho jane ke baavjood pradeep ko modi kaa bharosa hasil tha
 The chief minister is believed to have ignored the advice that Pradeep is reunited with his elder brother
 modi unhen lagaataar acchhee posting dete rahe
 These days, IPS officer Singhal allegedly spied a female architect at the behest of Shah and Modi
 us samay bhavnagar ke nagarpalika ayukta pradeep sharma par najar rakhi jane lagi
 Pradeep says, "it is not hidden from anyone that tapping phones is common in Gujarat
" ’’ pradeep ko apane sutron se jab khabar mili ki unhen nishchit rup se giraftaar kar liya jayega to unhone bade bhai ko is baat ke liye raji kiya ki ve kuch varisht iees adhikariyon ke madhyam se modi or shah ke saamne samjhaute kaa prastaav rakhen, lekin unki koshish bekaar gai
 Pradeep Sharma was arrested from his house in Bhavnagar in January 2010
 is bich kuldeep ne apni pronnatti ke liye kanoon kaa rasta akhriyaar kiya, kyonki gujarat sarkaar ne unhen usase vanchit kar diya tha
 He also corrected his annual confidential report through the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) from "very good" to "brilliant" as it has been throughout his career
 centre main pratiniyukti par disambar 2012 main beuro of police research and deveopment ke mahanideshak ke pad se ritair hone ke baad unhen dilli main grih mantralay main salaahkaar kii maujuuda niyukti mil gai
 Now Singhal's audio tapes have come as a silver lining for Pradeep
 singhl ko june main jamaanat par reeha kar diya gaya, kyonki sibiai 90 din kii nirdhaarit avadhi ke bheetar unke khilaaf aarope patr daakhil nahin kar pai, jisase mana ja rahaa he ki upie sarkaar ke ishaare par unke or agency ke bich koi samjhauta ho gaya he
 In February in the Ishrat Jahan case, CBI arrested Singhal as the main accused
 ab modi ko nicha dikhaane ke liye upie sarkaar dwaara in naaraaz afasaron kaa istemaal karne kii sambhavit yojana ko lekar sawaal uthaae ja rahe hai
 Why was Singhal recording all his conversations with Shah? Shah reportedly asked her to spy on the female architect
 singhl ke kareebi sutron kaa kahana he ki rajya main avishvaas kaa gaharaa maahaul tha, isliye unhone apane phone main ek aisa software lagava rakhaa tha jo sari baatcheet ko swatah hi tepe kar letaa tha
 With this, his trust with the Gujarat government was then lost
 jab farji muthbhed ke maamalon main unhen or kuch duusare aaropee police adhikariyon ko rajya sarkaar kii ore se kisi tarah kii madad nahin mili
 Personally, his displeasure with the Modi government further increased when his 16-year-old son committed suicide in 2012 during an investigation into fake encounter cases
 singhl ne sibiai ko 4 april, 17 april or phir 9 june ko teen bayaan die
 In his last statement, he elaborated how Amit Shah asked him to spy on the woman
 unhone sibiai ko do main se ek pen drive bhi de diya jisamen 4 agast 2008 or 10 sitambar, 2009 ke bich amit shah samet vibhinn mahatvapurn logon ke saath baatcheet shaamil thi
 In the first two statements, Singhal revealed that he did a lot of things which were against the law at Shah's behest
 ve kehete hai ki soharabuddin maamle main ve do mahatvapurn gavaahon-dasharath patel or ramanbhai patel, donon builder-se mili, taaki unhen gavaahi se mukarne ke liye taiyaar kiya jaae
 Singhal was given a big temptation to persuade these two builders
 ve bataate hai ki bijepi netaa bhupendra singh chudasma ne modi kii ore se unase kaha ki agar ve donon bilderon ko manaa len to mukhyamantri unhen bachaa sakate hai
 Singhal, who stayed away from the discussion, in 2004 encounter specialist D
 ji
 Worked with Vanzara during his tenure at Ahmedabad Crime Branch
 ishrat jahaan maamle main unke khilaaf vahi aarope hai, jo vanjaaraa ke khilaaf lagaae gaye hai
 These charges include charges of murder and conspiracy to murder
 muthbhed maamle main unki pramukh bhoomika ke baad singhl ko 2007 main pramotion dekar ipies bana diya gaya tha
 Not only this, he continued to get good appointments in the state even after that
 singhl ne india today se baat karne se manaa kar diya
 Vanzara is still in jail, while Singhal has managed to secure bail for allegedly supporting the CBI
 vanjaaraa ne bhi vidrohi tevar akhriyaar kar liya tha, jab unhone is saal modi sarkaar par unka or duusare police adhikariyon kaa saath chhodie kaa aarope lagaate hue apana istipha bhej diya tha
 He also accused his "god" Modi that he had come under the influence of the "evil" Shah
 pradeep sharma is baat se inkaar karte hai ki ve modi ke khilaaf naaraaz adhikariyon ko sangathit karne kii koshish kar rahe hai
 He says, "modi has his own ways of preventing him from getting organized"
 pradeep sharma apni is ladaai ko bade asardaar andaaj main bayaan karte hai, ‘‘vanjaaraa ab shant hai
 i could apologize too
 lekin maine apane bade bhai kaa saath dene kaa faisla kiya
 Laxman could never join hands with Ravana, leaving his brother Rama
 yah ladaai aasaan nahin he, lekin yah jaruri nahin ki sabhi ladaaiyaan jiti hi jaaen
 i may lose, but i will lose by fighting
 ’’ itnaa kahkar ve tahalne ke liye chal padate hai

 pakistan se milane vaali haal kii report main niojit nivesh 60 arab dollar se zyada he
 The relationship between the two may be portrayed as very rhetorical, but the ground reality is different
 pakistan or china ke bich aarthik or vyapaarik sambandh utane achche nahin hai, jitna ki samajha jaataa he
 China is its largest trading partner, with Pakistan also having an annual trade of between $ 12 and $ 15 billion in recent years, which is also mainly leaning towards China
 2007 main hue china-pakistan mukt vyapaar samjhaute (pat) ko pakistan ke vyapaaree apane udyog ke liye vinaashkari maanate hai
 In 2013, a study conducted by Pakistan Business Council, Pakistan's largest trade organization, found that after FTA, China's share of total exports to Pakistan remained below 10 percent, while China was the second largest in terms of imports
 Source, a little over 25 percent
 isamen petroleum padaarthon kaa aayaat shaamil nahin

 andrew small ne apni kitaab da china pakistan axis main china ke nivesh par visheshgyata rakhane vaale pakistani jaankaron ke mutabik, 2013 main china ke nivesh ko 5-7 arab dollar bataaya he
 Only a small percentage of the money promised by China in the form of debt has come into the country
 kaaranh pakistan main us paise ke upyog kii kshamta bahut kam rahi he or suraksha kii sthiti bahut bhayaavah
 In an area where there is a dire need to make road connectivity, CPEC could have been a welcome move, but the corridor passes through Indian territory, which Pakistan has illegally occupied
 bharat ko saath lekar pakistan ek taraf madhya or pashchim asia to duusari taraf dakshinpurv asia or usase aage ke deshon ko jodgaye main ek pul kaa kaam kar saktaa he
 But Pakistan is so enthusiastic about CPEC that it is ignoring a possible route between East and West
 vah apane desh se hokar purv-pashchim ke ek phydemand pargaman maarg or uske saath hi saarc deshon ke bich ek sampark maarg banane kii bhi upeksha kar rahaa he
 CPEC had its seeds at the time of the Karakoram highway built in the 1960s and '70s
 guadar port ke pehle charan kaa nirmaan, jo china kii madad se 2006 main puraa ho gaya tha, ek ahm kadam tha
 But due to worsening security situation, China did not take it forward
 isaki jagah port of singapore athurity (piese) ko 40 saal kaa sanchaalan anubandh de diya gaya
 However, due to poor connectivity with the rest of the country, this port could not be started
 iskaa ek kaaran yah bhi tha ki pakistan kii nausena port se satee jameen piese ko nahin dena chahta thi
 In February 2013, the Government of Pakistan handed over the operation of the port to China Overseas Port Holding Company Limited
 to phir aisa kya hua ki china ne suraksha kii khatarnaak sthiti jari rahane ke baavjood apana man badal liya
 The economic benefits of the corridor are being exaggerated
 15,000 foot ke khunjaraab darre se guzarati, madhya asia se hokar china ko jane vaali tel or gas kii pipelinon kaa koi khaas phayda nahin he
 CPEC may have some economic meaning as this corridor may be strategically beneficial to it and may act as a bypass, originating from the Malacca Strait Central
 guadar bhi china kii nausena ke liye faras kii khadi ke muhane par phydemand sabit ho saktaa he
 At the same time, Pakistan can also benefit from it as a naval base, which will be more off the Indian coast than Karachi
 pakistan se hokar guzarane vaala sipiisi galiyara bahut nirbaadh bhi nahin hoga
 In addition to the security threats, there is a doubt in the small states that the eastern part of CPEC, which passes through Pakistan's Punjab, should be given more importance and the part passing through khyber-pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan less importance
 Used to be
 ek anya chintaa yah he ki is galiyare ke banane se madhyam or lambii avadhi main desh kii arthvyavastha par vipareet asar pad saktaa he
 Speaking on CPEC at the Pakistan Business and Economic Conference in Karachi in October 2016, Pakistan Business Council CEO Ehsan Ali Malik had said, "the gifted horse, which we are hesitant to peek into, is a cheating horse somewhere
" (trojan horse)
 " unhone galiyare ke kinare karachi main banaae jane vaale vyapaarik kshetra ko lekar chintaa jaahir kii or andeh jataayaa ki isse kya itani videshi mudra aegi, jisase ham sipiisi ke karj ko puraa kar sakenge? yojana or vikaas par seenet kii sthaayee samiti ke adhyaksh ne is galiyare ke banane se desh ke hiton kii suraksha ko lekar spashtataa kii maang kii
 He said, "china is our brother
 lekin vyapaar apni jagah he
 "china has made a huge contribution in building Pakistan's military industrial complex and has become the largest arms supplier to Pakistan
 1990 ke dashak main em-11 or em-9 mixilon kii aapurti or duusare delivery system ko viksit karne main china kii sahaayta milane se pakistan ke missile kaarykram ko bahut phayda hua he
 It is well known that Pakistan acquired the nuclear capability long before the Atom bomb was tested in 1998 due to technical support from China
 chashma 1 or chashma 2 riektaron (jo 2004 main newclear saplir group main china ke shaamil hote samay ''grandfadar cloj" se surakshit the) ke baad china ne chaar anya riektaron kaa nirmaan kiya he—do chashma main or do karachi ke paas
 The sino-pakistan friendship is thus far broader than our immediate concerns — China's opposition to India's attempt to join the NSG and Masood Azhar, the chief of jaish-e-mohammed, on the list of individuals banned under UNSC Proposition 1267

 pakistan main chini nagarikon par hamale bad gaye hai
 China has not shown any intention to be an alternative to the financial assistance Pakistan receives from America
 pakistan main china ke nivesh mukhya rup se lambii avadhi ke aasaan karj ke rup main hi rahe hai
 China is trying to move forward on two conflicting objectives: to use it as a strategic partner and transit route, and to keep India under control
 lekin china ko america ke anubhavon se sabak lenaa chahie
 Pakistan does not necessarily work on its patron's agenda after seeking military assistance
 apane sangrakshak se milane vaale samarthan ko vah bharat ke khilaaf dushmani nibhaane ke liye ek license ke taur par samajhataa he, jisamen vah sangrakshak kii ore se khinchi gai laal rekha yani sanyam baratane kii hidaayaton kaa bhi dhyaan nahin rakhata
 He does not even care about his economic abilities in playing hostility towards India
 apni sena par vah kshamta se zyada kharch kar rahaa he, afghanistan main ranneetik majbootee hasil karne main laga he or pakistan main dharmik ugravad failaane vaale lashkar-e-taiyaba jaise sanghathanon ko posane main laga rahata he
 His hostile attitude against India actually contained the seeds of his instability
 uskaa sangrakshak agar uske is ravaiye ko badhaava detaa he to antat use ek asthir sahyogi hi milegaa, jo na bharosemand ranneetik partner ban saktaa he, na surakshit pargaman root muhaiyaa kara saktaa he
 We cannot ignore the growing nexus between China and Pakistan

 If China continues to use Pakistan to curb India, then it can prove to be dangerous for itself

 The bjp's masterstroke before the Delhi Assembly elections approves the bill to regularize illegal colonies
 Illegal colonies have more than 40 lakh population
 The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has made a big political bet before the Delhi Assembly elections
 modi cabinet kii buudhvaar ko hui baithak methvaidh coloniyon ko regularise karne ke vidheyakako manjuuri de di gai
 Now this bill will go for approval in both houses of parliament
 avaidh coloniyon ko regularise karne kii maang kai saalon se uth rahi thi, jise puraa karke bijepi ne apni pehali siyaasi chaal chal di he, jiskaa asar vidhansabha chunaav par padegaa

 BJP or AAP main credit kii hodamodi sarkaar ne kuch maheene pehle hi 1797 avaidh coloniyon ko niyamit karne kaa elaan kiya tha
 During this, CM Arvind Kejriwal had said, 'we were fighting this battle for a long time
 is faisle ke liye centre sarkaar kaa shukriya adaa karte hai
 We sent this proposal in 2015 and since then the Delhi Government was in constant touch with the Central Government
 kejariwal kaa kahana he ki 24 july 2019 ko unhone iske masaude par apane suzav bhi die the
 aap's performance on the day, the cabinet's seal in the evening, AAP leader Sanjay Singh had said, 'the government had on 2 November 2015 sent the Cabinet's decision to regularize unauthorized colonies to the BJP government at the Center
 chaar saal tak bhaajapa khamosh rahi janata ko bharosa tabhi hoga jab unke haath main registry hogi
 BJP should pass an ordinance on this
 ' adhyadesh ke liye aam aadmi party ne buudhvaar ko sansad ke baahar pradarshan kiya or sarkaar se bill laane kii maang kii
 In the evening, the Modi cabinet approved the bill
 avaidh colony main rahane vaale logon ko milenge ye phydemodi cabinet ne avaidh coloniyon ko niyamit karne ke vidheyak par muhar laga di
 Now after the bill is passed in Parliament, people living in the colonies will get ownership of their land
 iske saath hi sarkaar ne dilli bhoomi sudhaar adhinium kii dhara 81 ke sabhi maamalon ko waapas lene ke prastaav ko manjuuri de di
 Also, urbanization of 79 villages was also given a green signal
 aap sabhi 18 april ke chunaav ayog kii press conference kaa video dekhie
 This video is a document of decline of the Commission
 jis vakt ayog kaa suraj duubataa nazar aa rahaa tha usee vakt ek ayukta ke haath kii ungaliyon main panna or maanik kii anguuthiyaan chamak rahi thim
 Sitting in the office, i suddenly started seeing the live feed coming through the news agency
 sirf do sawaalon ke jawaab main ayuktaon ke jawaab or unki nigahen dekh lijie
 Listen to the response to the action taken on the search of the Prime Minister's chopper and seeking votes in the name of Balakot, you will be clear that the sun of the Election Commission has become dim
 panna or maanik se las ek ayukta kii donon anguuthiyaan ankhon main khatakane lageen to kisi ko phone karne laga ki hare rang kaa panna or halke laal rang kaa maanik kab pahante hai
 The answer is that if the intellect and the sun are weak, then wear them to strengthen
 main soch main pad gaya ki yah vyakti samvidhan kii prakriyaaon se ayukta bana he yaa phir jyotish ke sanyog se
 If the mere coincidence of astrology contributes to its career, then why are we hoping that the commissioner wants to register his name in history for constitutional limitations
 9 april ko maharashtra ke latur kii chunavi raily main die gaye pradhanmantri modi ke bayaan par ayog abhi tak koi ection nahin le paaya he
 At that rally, the Prime Minister had said that voters who vote for the first time cannot dedicate their vote to the martyrs of Pulwama and the brave soldiers involved in Balakot Airstrike
 is bayaan par ayog abhi tak karrwai nahin kar sakaa
 Answer was sought from the Chief Electoral Officer of Maharashtra
 patrakaron ne poocha ki us par kya karrwai hui to jawaab mila ki pradhanmantri ke bhaashan kaa sirf ek paragraph aayaa tha
 An authentic copy of the entire speech was sought which has arrived
 uski jaanch kii ja rahi he
 School habits do not last a lifetime
 homework nahin karne par homework copy ghar chhot gai he kaa jawaab chunaav ayukta ke jawaab main jhalak rahaa tha
 At the time the commissioners were counting that so many complaints have been settled, at the same time were unable to answer why it took 9 days to take action on the Prime Minister's speech
 jabaki sena ke istamaal par mukhyamantri yogi adityanath or muqataar abbaas naqvi ko ayog ne chetavanee de di he
 Obviously, the use of the army is not legal, then in the case of the Prime Minister, are the Commissioners wearing the emerald topaz of the Commission afraid? If you are feeling so scared, then they should also wear coral and sapphire and resign from their post
 itnaa yaad rakhana chahie ki itihaas panne palatataa he
 They are not only history but also their present
 apane doston, pariwaron se mukhaatib hai
 The Election Commission suspended Observer Mohammad Mohsin of Odisha
 pradhanmantri modi ke helicopter kii talaashi ke kaaran ayog ne jin niyamon kaa hawala dete hue nilambit kiya unka kahin koi vajood nazar nahin aata he
 Pick up the guidelines that the Commission gives to the officers posted on election duty and read whether it is written in it that the SPG should not check the helicopter of the safe person
 kis panne par likhaa he bataa de
 Obviously not written
 jab sawaal uthaa to ayog ko sari baton ke saath press conference main aana chahie tha magar na to iskaa sidhaa jawaab de paae ki kiski shikaayat par karrwai kii or na hi iskaa ki kis niyam ke tahat mohammad mohsin ko suspend kiya
 Sometimes said field officer, never said DO, never said CEO, sometimes said magistrate
 aap khud bhi wo video dekhen jise maine prime time main dikhaaya he, aapako chunaav ayog ke patan kaa cheharaa dikh jayega
 The order dated 10 April 2014 is being cited
 is aadesh ko aap bhi padhein
 It is written in it that the SPG safe person cannot use government vehicles but the Prime Minister and other political figures are exempted that they can use government vehicles
 kyonki inhen aatanki or charampanthi gatividhiyon se khatara hota he or ucch stareey suraksha kii zarurat hoti he
 Whose protection is protected by constitutional provisions made by Parliament or Vidhan Sabha
 lekin is aadesh main yah kahin nahin likhaa he ki chunaav adhikari unke helicopter kii talaashi nahin le saktaa he
 It is written that "if at all there is any doubt that under the SPG Act or other special provisions, the authority has increased the security assessment in such a way that the election in favor of any party or candidate from those vehicles If interests are affected, the Commission will bring the matter to the notice of the Government concerned so that appropriate action can be taken
 ”yani helicopter kii talaashi lee ja sakati he tabhi to aap dekh paaenge ki helicopter kaa istamaal chunaav ko prabhavit karne ke liye ho rahaa he yaa nahin
 Obviously Mohammad Mohsin did the right thing
 pradhanmantri rahete hue manmohan singh ke vaahan kii bhi talaashi lee gai thi
 Not only this, when the reporters asked under which order they needed a copy of the suspension, the commissioner was responding that we will check
 ham pataa karenge
 He also said that if an officer is investigating, should Mohammad Mohsin be suspended before the investigation? There is another order dated 14 July 1999
 chunaav ayog ne isamen kahin nahin likhaa he ki talaashi se kisi sarkari vimaan yaa helicopter ko chhot di gai he
 The order dated 10 April 2014 also does not say that the Prime Minister's helicopter cannot be searched
 chunaav duty par tainaat afasaron ko jo kitaab di jaati he usamen bhi nahin likhaa he
 The Election Commission has cited in its defense the order dated 22 March 2019 which has been read by our colleague Arvind Gunasekhar and has also shown in his report
 yah aadesh commercial airport par un logon kii jaanch nahin hogi jinhen espiji suraksha ke kaaran chhot mili he
 But the Prime Minister's helicopter was searched in Sambalpur in Odisha where there is no airport
 pradhanmantri ke kaaran chunaav ayog har din apana bharosa kho rahaa he
 Sending the recommendation of action against Governor Kalyan Singh to the President has been relaxed
 raashtrapati ne bhi abhi tak koi ection nahin liya he
 Every floor of the institutions seems to be collapsing in the 2019 elections
 janata ko nahin dikhataa to kya jyotish logon se hi kaha jaae ki ve ayog ke adhikariyon ko har tarah ke ratna pahana den taaki ve apana sanvaidhanik kaam kar saken
 Is there any ring that the fingers of the Election Commissioner should also look beautiful by wearing and they can do constitutional work by being fearless and impartial
 agar yah nahin ho saktaa he to ek or kaam kiijie
 Open a separate Election Commission for Prime Minister Narendra Modi whose office is in his mobile phone

 Therefore, we are also urging the State Governments to educate the implementing agencies about the use of the provisions of the IT Act

 jab ve kehete hai ki hadiya 'stoffhome syndrome' (aisi manodasha jahaan bandhak apartaaon ko hi apana shubhachintak maanane lagata he) se peedit he yaa khap jaisi chizon ko kisi ke vivaah ko chunauti dene kaa adhikaar praapt he, to unki bhav-bhangima aisi thi maano ve apane huddang ko is nek prayaas main ek chota-sa yogadan maan rahe hon
 Such stories are an example of the deep connection between law politics and society that the scrimmage looks like today as never before as a bizarre change is now seen in the intellectual underpinnings of people who are politically active
 is rajnatik soch ko khaad-pani un swayambhu netaaon se milti he jo dhithaayee kii had tak kaayade-kanoon se dur hai
 In this way, our leaders add further impediments to the proceedings of our courts already burdened with work
 adaalaton ko sanvaidhanik aadarshon ko banaae rakhane ke liye atirikt mashkkat kerani padati he jabaki ek saamaajik vaastaviktaa ke aage vivash dikhataa rajnatik tabaka sudhaar ke liye koi prayaas nahin karata
 In the Hadiya case alone, the Supreme Court had nine dates (it is useless to speak of the bench of the Kerala High Court, which had annulled the marriage in its judgment) and why so, the national investigation of sensational 'love Jihad' in Kerala Tales of agency (NIA) investigation are also in place
 18veen sadi ke angrej chintak edmund bark ne bristol ke matadaataaon ko aagaah karte hue kaha tha, ''aapkaa janpratinidhi aapke prati dendar he, keval uske udhyam nahin, balki uske nirnay bhi
 If he leaves it to your thoughts then cheating on you
 ''viraasat main mili aisi soch hamaare rajnatik vaataavaran main kahin gum ho jaati he jahaan lokapriyata kii lahar par savaar netaa, apane rajnatik hit saadhane ke liye kisi bhi had tak girane ko aatur rahete hai
 It is a testimony to the failure of our elected public representatives to do their job well that the Supreme Court is forced to make such derogatory statements
 sarkaar kaa koi bhi sadsy hamen yah bataane ko raji nahin ki pahchaan kii raajnneeti kii aad main jo hinsa ho rahi he us par ve kya kar rahe hai
 No one is telling how the divisive politics for which there is no place in the Constitution will be compensated
 sab stock bazaar or aarthik shaktiyon jaise vishay par to khub baaten karte hai lekin samaaj ko apni chapet main lene ke liye teji se bad rahi ek khatarnaak beemaari ke spasht sanketon ko dekhne ke baad bhi log chuppi saadhe baithe hai
 Ordering rape of Khap Panchayats (as happened in Baghpat, Uttar Pradesh in 2015), molesting coworkers, murders motivated by political disagreements, killing professional people, actors and writers as well as young lovers Threat of this is becoming the new identity of our society today
 in vishyon ko uthaane vaale log paryaapt sankhya main nahin he taaki baat huddangiyon or unke netaaon tak joardaar aawaaj main pahunchaai ja sake
 This is a scenario when intellectuals also become part of the crowd

 At the same time, AIMIM President Asaduddin Owaisi opposed it
 ovaisi ne kaha ki hindu ho yaa musalmaan, bhejnaa ho to saare sharnaarthiyon ko waapas unke mulk bhejo
 Asaduddin Owaisi answered all questions of Rajdeep Sardesai in India Today Conclave
 is dauraan unhone ne kaha ki bharat ek loktantric or dharmanirpeksh desh he, jahaan sabhi ke liye ek kanoon he
 Owaisi asked Hemant Biswa Sharma whether he had taken the oath of constitution
 unke haa kehane par ovaisi ne kaha ki samvidhan ke anuchhed 14 ke anusaar kisi bhi dharm ke saath bhedbhaav nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Hindus, Christians, Buddhists, do not recite Sikhs but only talk of repatriating Muslim refugees
 bengali musalmaan or bengali hindu main kaise bhed kar sakate hai
 It is unconstitutional to do so
 ovaisi ne kaha, ' main maan nahin saktaa ki sabhi musalamaanon ko baahar bhej diya jaae' is par hemanth bishwa sharma ne kaha ki aisa ho hi nahin saktaa ki ham hinduon ko waapas pakistan bhej den narkiy jivan jeene ke liye
 Owaisi asked why then you told Sheikh Hasina that no one would be sent back
 ovaisi ne kaha ki yah hindu raashtra banane kii sajeesh he, jiske tahate musalamaanon ko baahar kiya ja rahaa he
 On the other hand, under the Citizenship Amendment Bill, efforts are being made to settle people of religion like Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain
 sarkaar agar sharnaarthiyon ko waapas bhejnaa chaahati he to vah hindu ho yaa musalmaan sabhi ko bheja jaae
 However, Hemant Biswa Sharma said on the Citizenship Amendment Bill that sometimes tough decisions have to be taken in politics
 hamane citigenship ke bare main faisla kiya
 Under this, Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs living in Jains, Pakistan or Bangladesh are to be given citizenship of India
 ham hinduon ko keval naagarikta dene kii baat kar rahe hai, is par bhi etraj ho rahaa he
 Biswa said that Bangladeshi Muslims who have settled here illegally have captured our politics

 It was considered that the servers of all social media giants are not in India, so it is difficult to regulate them

 12:00 AM PAK termed India's decision not to attend SAARC conference as 'unfortunate' bharat ke chotii ke of spinner ravichandran aswin ne kaha ki anukool paristhitiyon main mejabaan team ko vartmaan world tii20 championships main haraana behad mushkil hoga
 India lost to New Zealand on a pitch that took the first match but they made a great comeback by defeating Parapakistan on a similar pitch in the next match
 aswin ne pakistan par team kii chah wicket se jeet ke baad bcci
 He told TV, 'our team is very good
 jab hamaara din ho or paristhitiyaan hamaare anukool hon to phir hamaari team ko haraana behad mushkil hoga
 'but there are exceptions and this has happened on some occasions with the Indian team as well
 ‘do baar vipakshi team kaa akalan karne main hui galati’aswin ne kaha, ‘apwaad bhi honge
 We recently lost against Sri Lanka in Pune and then New Zealand in Nagpur
 donon avasaron par virdohi team ne hamaari tulana main match kaa sahi akalan kiya
 Ashwin, considered a thoughtful cricketer, said that even though Eden Gardens was getting a lot of turn, it was not as easy as it seemed
 unhone kaha, ‘ravindra jadeja or main ek nishchit length par gend kar rahe the
 This was important
 ’ aswin ne iske saath hi kaha ki pakistan ke khilaaf toss jeetna mahatvapurn tha
 He said, 'luckily we won the toss and the pitch was taking a little spin which made the work easy
 wicket main nami thi
 i was thinking that we should bowl first
 ’is of spinner ne kaha, ‘is tarah ke wicket par aap pakke taur par nahin kah sakate ki aapako kitna score bananaa chahie
 The important thing is that you bowl tightly and hold the opposing team to a certain score
 ek baar aap aisa kar dete ho to phir ballebaaji karnaa aasaan ho jaataa he
 You can improve the innings better by chasing the target on such a wicket
 ’‘kifayati gendbaaji karnaa meraa lakshya’aswin ne iske saath hi kaha ki vah hameshaa kshetrarakshan ke hisaab se gendbaaji karte hai
 He said, 'when we bowl first, i want to give at least runs
 meraa kaam apane kshetrarakshan ke anusaar gendbaaji karnaa hota he or yadi is prakriya main main kuch wicket hasil kar letaa hum to main puri tarah se bhinn gendbaaj ban jaataa hum
 He also said that while bowling, it was not in the minds of Indians how many goals they had to chase
 aswin ne kaha, ‘ham keval is baat ko lekar chintit the ki pehle paanch over kaise khele jaaen
 If they start well, then it is not easy to come back
 ’ aswin ne sweekaar kiya ki newjiland ke khilaaf pehle match main haar ke baad team dabaav main thi
 He said, 'it was important for us to forget him and play the match afresh
 hamane aisa hi kiya
 'ashwin has not been able to take wickets' It is worth mentioning that Ashwin has taken only one wicket in two matches of the World T20 played on India's turn taking pitches
 unke alaava team ke duusare spinner ravindra jadeja kii jholii main do wicket aae hai
 On the other hand, Kiwi spinner Mitchell Santner, the bowler who played a key role in defeating India, has taken six wickets in as many matches

 vah june, 2011 kii ek tapati dopahari thi, jab 18 saal kii lakshmi apane ghar ke angan main chulhaa jalaae rotiyaan senk rahi thi
 Then the sound of knocking the door was heard
 jaisi ki lakshmi kii hameshaa aadat thi, vah chulhaa jalataa chhod daravaaje kii ore lapki
 There were four stranger faces at the gate, whom she was seeing for the first time
 isse pehle ki vah puuchhati ki 'koun ho, kisase milanaa he'
 Lakshmi's mother noticed from behind and dragged her face down on her face with shock, 'go inside, your friends have come
 ' us din lakshmi ko pehali baar pataa chalaa ki vah shaadishuda he
 In childhood, when she passed away after her grandmother, her maternal uncle had got Lakshmi married for a year there
 godi main uthaakar phere lagavaaye or is tarah uski puri jindagi do saal ke rakesh naam ke ek ladke ke sang saat pheron main baandh di
 But Lakshmi refused to accept the life set by the society with her head bowed and approached the court against her family's decision
 ab vah hindustan kii pehali aisi ladki ban gai he, jiske bal-vivaah ko baqayada court ne bal vivaah nishedh adhinium, 1929 ke tahat radd qaraar diya he
 No one expected this Scheduled Tribe girl and daughter of a daily laborer living in village Loni, about 40 km from Jodhpur district headquarters in Rajasthan
 gharavaalon ne sochaa bhi nahin tha ki tikhi ankhon vaali saadhaaran-si dikhne vaali yah ladki saat pheron or maathe ke sindur ko chunauti bhi de sakati he
 Lakshmi's father, Tejaram, 50, remembers that day, saying, "the whole day turned into a mad man
" ro-rokar bura haal ho gaya
 'laxmi heard the decree,' i don't know my in-laws
 main nahin maanati is shaadi ko
 i do not know that boy
 'yah bahut bada faisla tha
 90 percent of the girls in the village were made to sit in the dock
 lakshmi kii maa 45 varshiya sukkhi devi apana hawala deteen, 'meraa byaah bhi aise hi hua tha
 Your sister also happened the same way
 sabakaa aise hota he
 Why won't the in-laws leave? ' lekin majaal ki lakshmi tus se mas ho
 45-year-old Tararam, Lakshmi's uncle, says, "lakshmi was very sharp from childhood
 koi cheez thaan le to thaan le
 Nobody can force
 'lakshmi ke jija 25 varshiya bhadaram aage kaa kissa sunaate hai, 'lakshmi ghar par ladati rahi, gusse main bhukhi soti rahi or sasuraal waalon ke chakkar par chakkar lagate rahe
 But then we came to know that Rakesh's behavior is also not good
 vah kuch kamata nahin, sharaab peetaa he or buree sangat main rahata he
 'before the housemates could understand anything else, the police reached their house
 tejaraam kehete hai, 'ham garib log hai
 Korat-kachari, Police-station What can we know
 'gharavaale lakshmi kaa saath dena chaahate the, lekin police or kachhari ke naam se ve bhi dar gaye
 Then she was produced in the police station
 police ne sulah karaane kii koshish kii
 Lakshmi was also intimidated, but her decision did not change
 rakesh kaa parivaar apekshaakrit dhani tha
 His father Tarachand used to be a contractor
 ek din ve bulero gaadi main do-chaar lathait lekar loni pahunch gaye
 On that day also, Lakshmi was baking the loaves in the same courtyard and she had also opened the door
 phir puure gaanv kii panchayat baithi
 What should be done now
 ladki mar jane ko taiyaar he, lekin sasuraal jane ko nahin
 But then a village newspaper wrote on a paper and gave an address to illiterate Lakshmi
 yah pataa tha jodhpur ke sarathi trust kaa, jisaki sanchaalak kriti bharti kii madad se aakhirkaar lakshmi nyaayalay tak pahunch pai or court ne apane faisle main uske bal vivaah ko radd qaraar diya
 Bharti says, 'lakshmi was very scared when she came to me
 use sasuraal le jane ke liye rakesh ke gharavaalon ne police se lekar gundon tak kaa sahaara liya
 But it was the courage of the girl that she did not bow down to him
 ' rakesh shuru main is faisle ko maanane ke liye taiyaar nahin tha, lekin trust dwaara counselling kiye jane ke baad aakhirkaar notary ke saamne vah us affidavit par sin karne ke liye raji ho gaya, jiske mutabik ek saal kii umr main hue bal vivaah ko radd qaraar diya gaya
 The incident is dated April 24, 2012
 court ke faisle ke takreeban ek saal baad ab lakshmi ne dobaaraa byaah kiya he apni pasand ke ladke se
 Lakshmi first met Mahendra Sargara, a resident of Roht village, 30 km from Jodhpur, in her neighbor's house
 donon ne ek-duusare ko dekha, prem main pad gaye or ab shaadi ke baad lakshmi apni nai sasuraal main bahut khush he
 Mahendra is a daily wage laborer, but does not want to get Lakshmi to work
 vah kahata he, 'main lakshmi se pyaar karata hum or apni mehnat se use har tarah khush rakhana chahta hum
 'lakshmi too is not only courageous, but a woman spilling with self-respect
 uskaa ghar tutaa jhonpada he to kya hua, uske pita or pati dihadi majdoor hai to kya hua, use bardaasht nahin ki koi use kamatar samajhe yaa dabaae
 If a journalist wants to take a picture of her while sweeping, then she is shocked
 'ham nahin lagaayenge jhaadoo, hamako nahin khinchvaani photo
 'child marriage is a serious problem in Rajasthan
 gaiyr-kanoonee hone or rajya sarkaar dwaara tamaam koshishon ke baavjood yah puri tarah khatm nahin ho pai he
 The famous Bhanwari Devi case of 1992 is in front of us, who had to suffer the gang rape of upper caste people in order to stop child marriages happening in their village
 lekin ummid kii jaani chahie ki ab shiksha se sthiti main thodaa sudhaar aayaa he
 That is why Laxmi has become an example for girls from Loni and Roht to the victim of child marriage in Rajasthan and then forced to live with an unwanted husband
 rohat kii sarpanch 25 varshiya vimala patel kahati hai, 'lakshmi hamaare gaanv kii ladakiyon ke liye preranarot he
 Seeing Lakshmi, many girls are refusing to go to her in-laws' house
 ' khud lakshmi ke parivaar ko bhi is ghatana se sabak mila he
 Tararam says, 'we have come to understand how wrong child marriage is
 ab ham apane kisi bachche kii bachapan main shaadi nahin karenge
 'women and Child Development Minister of Rajasthan Bina Kak is also overwhelmed
 ve kahati hai, 'lakshmi se rajasthan kii bahut sari ladakiyon ko prerana milegi
 He is an example of bravery
 'lakshmi se prerit hokar 23 farvari ko jodhpur kii do ladakiyon 18 varshiya taruna or 15 varshiya bharti ne bhi apana bal vivaah nirast karwaane ke liye yachika daayar kii he
 Bharti says, "the number of girls coming to us has increased, who want to cancel their child marriage
" ' mano-chikitsak sudhir kakkad hansate hue kehete hai, 'paramparawaadi log kahenge ki yah sab ladakiyon ko padhaane kaa nateeja he
 They have started challenging by reading four letters
 lekin yahi sach he
 Child marriage cannot be stopped by making laws, but it can be canceled by giving education to girls
 ' Was the black money in the country just a bogeyman? Was there any such thing as black money in the country? These surprising questions are arising after the much awaited demonetisation figures were released by the Reserve Bank of India
 wo aankade jinamein kaha gaya he ki notebandi ke baad kendriya bank main bain kiye gaye takreeban sabhi note waapas laut aae hai
 The government had thought, black money will end, that at 8 pm on November 8, 2016, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the closure of one thousand and five hundred notes, after that the government and the BJP consistently claimed it That will automatically end black money stashed in the country
 is daawey ke peeche tark ye tha ki logon ne ek hajaar or paanch sau ke noton ke rup main jo kaala paisa jamaa kiya hoga wo bainkon main nahin lautega
 The amount which will not be returned will be considered as canceled by the Reserve Bank, which will be considered as the income of the government
 lekin hua iskaa thik ulataa
 16 thousand crores was just black money? In the figures released by the RBI on Wednesday, it was clear that 98 out of one thousand notes were banned
 4 pratishat note waapas aa chuke hai
 There is a total currency of only 16 thousand crores which has not been returned
 iskaa arth ye hua ki desh main yaa to mahaj 16 hajaar karod rupee kii blike mani he
 Because it does not seem practically possible that people should have black money but they should not be in the shape of a thousand or 500 note, but in the shape of a 100 or 50 rupee note
 kya flop sabit hui notebandi? RBI ke aankadon ke baad vipaksh hamalavar, jetali ne di safikala dhan tha to lekin wo bainkon main aa gaya?arabiai ke aankadon kaa duusari taraf vishleshan karen to lagata he ki desh main kaala dhan tha to lekin notebandi ke baad jugad system ke jariye wo waapas bainkon main aa gaya
 That is, the government's bet was reversed and the black money mobs turned out to be smarter than that
 ab sarkaar ke paas waapas aae noton main se koun sa paisa kaala dhan he or koun sa safed ye pataa karnaa takreeban naammumkin hoga
 After demonetisation, it was revealed that people somehow made their black money white through banks, post offices, hospitals, petrol pumps etc
 jandhan khaaton kaa iske liye vyapak taur par istemaal hua
 This was the reason that the government had to change its decisions repeatedly after demonetisation
 notebandi ke aankadon par sarkaar vs vipaksh: samajhen koun paas or koun fail?kya cash kii bajaay property-sone ke rup main he kaala dhan?ab jabaki ye saaf ho gaya he ki notebandi blike mani ko khatm karne ke apane mul makasad main naakaam rahi he, sawaal uth rahe hai ki kya desh main maujuud kaala dhan cash kii bajaay property or sone main tabdeel ho chukaa he
 During the demonetisation, the consumption of gold in the country was seen to increase
 sarkaar ne kai kaarobaariyon par ise lekar chaabuk bhi chalaaya tha
 Apart from this, the property market of the country is already called a black money parking lot, where new projects are not only being launched despite the demand and flat prices are increasing

 In view of the forthcoming Lok Sabha elections in Uttar Pradesh, where all the major political parties are busy laying their own pieces, JDU is also preparing loudly in Uttar Pradesh after waving its glory in Bihar
 yahi kaaran he ki jediu ke sabhi maujuuda jila adhyaksh apane-apane jilon main party ke liye sambhaavnaaen talash rahe hai
 Following instructions from the national leadership of the party, JDU state president Suresh Niranjan Bhaiya is also directing the district presidents in full power to prepare for the election
 pradesh adhyaksh suresh niranjan ne bataaya, 'pradesh ke samast maujuuda jiladhyakshon ko chunaav kii taiyaariyon ke bare main disha-nirdesh de diya gaya he
 They have been asked to explore possibilities in their respective fields
 jiladhyakshon se kaha gaya he ki party ke liye ummidavaaron kii talash ke saath-saath pratyaashiyon ke chunaav main khadey hone kaa maahaul taiyaar karen
 He said that the district heads of the party have been instructed to decide candidates from their own constituencies
 unhone kaha, 'ummidavaar chayan ke baad hamaare prabharee us prastaavit naam kii jaanch padtaal or uske raajnneetik kariyar kii acchhee tarah jaankaree lenge uske baad hi naam par antim muhar lagaai jaaegi
 'however, JDU has district presidents in only 56 districts of the state
 adhyaksh ke mutabik, shesh jiladhyakshon kii jald hi ghoshnaa kar di jaaegi
 The state president blamed the BJP for its defeat in the last assembly election, saying, 'JDU could not succeed in up's Vidhan Sabha elections due to any reason, but this time we will leave no stone unturned

 This initiative to give constitutional status to the Lokpal has come in the wake of Congress General Secretary Rahul Gandhi's suggestion to this effect during the session of Parliament ended last month
 lokapal ke swaroop ke bare main puche jane par vidhi mantri ne kaha ki iske liye 11 sadasyeey nikaay banane kaa prastaav he jisamen se kam se kam 50 pratishat sadasyon ko kanoonee visheshgyata praapt hogi
 These would be members like the Supreme Court and former judges of the High Court

 The Lokpal Bill will come with a constitutional amendment
 
 
 is sanshodhan se lokapal kaa darja sanvaidhanik praadhikaar kaa ho jaayegaa

 unhone kaha, charchaa se judi sabhi samagriyon ko sthaayee samiti ke paas bhej diya gaya he
 On the suggestion of Rahul Gandhi, cognizance was taken and he has also been sent

 The real motive of the note captive is that the money of the poor is deposited in the bank and distributed among the few rich friends of Modi ji who roam in the airplane with him for the day

 They have to come forward and they will have to explain it

 Modi also had a rally on 11 December in Bahraich district of eastern Uttar Pradesh
 lekin kharaab mausam ke kaaran modi is raily main nahin pahunch paae the or unhone dilli se hi raily main aae logon ko phone se sambodhit kiya tha
 Referring to Modi's rally in Bahraich, Rahul Gandhi said that i heard that the voice was not coming properly when Modi ji was addressing people by phone
 lekin jis mobile phone se thik se baat bhi nahin ho paati, modi usee mobile phone se india ko cashles banane kii baat kar rahe hai
 Rahul said that there is also a conspiracy behind making cashless
 rahul ne kaha ki jitani baar aap mobile se tranjaction karenge utani baar 5 fisadi kamishan modi ke amir mitron ke khajaane main pahunch jayega
 In his Bahraich rally, Rahul Gandhi again repeated the same allegations about Modi which he had talked about in Gujarat
 rahul gandhi ke baharich kii raily se kuch hi der pehle narendra modi ne apane sansadeey kshetra banaras main bhi raily kii
 Modi had said in his speech while taking a sarcasm on Rahul Gandhi that it is good at least he is learning to give speech
 rahul ne kaha ki unka majaak udaane se kaam chalane vaala nahin he modi ko apane upar lag rahe aaropon kaa jawaab dena chahie
 Rahul Gandhi showed aggressive attitude about the problems related to the note ban and explained to the people that the note detainee has nothing to do with black money
 darasal iskaa makasad he chand amir logon kii madad karnaa jinka hajaaron karod kaa karj modi kii sarkaar maaf kar chuki he
 Rahul referred to the statement at the time of the Lok Sabha elections in which Modi had asked people to give Rs 15 lakh from black money from abroad
 rahul ne kaha ki sirf 6 fisadi kaala dhan cash main he jabaki modi paise nikaalane ke liye khadey line main har aadmi ko chor sabit karne par jute hai

 Screenplays have been made keeping the plot of the film the same
 film shuru hoti he 80 ke dashak ke sonakshi ke dance number se
 Then Ajay Devgan's entry into the fighting ring
 muqabla jeetne ke baad ajay pahunchate hai, ek gaanv main jahaan jaalim sarpanch kaa raaj he
 Ajay protects the village with his mother and sister and is in love with Sarpanch's daughter Tamanna
 kahani main or bhi mode hai, jo film main dekh sakate hai
 'himmatwala' is a remake so obviously, director Sajid Khan has added every spice of the 80s
 jahaan majaboor maa he, besahaara bahan he or sarpanch ke sataae hue gaanvvaale hai
 The film has the same dialogue, the same dramatic scene and the same situation
 'himmatwala' ke donon puraane gane is film main bhi achche lag rahe hai
 Ajay Devgan's acting is good
 tamanna bhi film main acchhee lagi hai
 The comments hit film 'he baby' or 'housephul' bana chuke diarector sajid khan ne ek formula pakadaa he, jisamen kabhi bandar to kabhi sher ko apni film main lete hai taaki bachche bhi maje le saken
 Sajid tries to make a masala film, which has all kinds of tempering
 haalanki film me kai seen kaaphi drametic hai, jo atapate lagate hai, magar chunki us daur main aisa cinema hit tha isliye unhen nazarandaaj karnaa padataa he
 Overall, one can say that this is the loud cinema of the 80s, which is introduced in today's era
 agar aapako us daur kaa cinema pasand he to 'himmatwala' aapako acchhee lagegi
 Rating of 'himmatwala', 3 stars to revive the 80s era
 'himmatwala' rimek he isliye jaahir he, diarector sajid khan ne 80 ke dashak ke har masaale ko daalaa he
 Where the forced mother is, the destitute is the sister and the sarpanch's persecuted villagers
 film main vaise hi dialog hai, vaise hi drametic seen or waisi hi sichuation
 Both the old songs of 'himmatwala' look good in this film too
 ajay devgan kaa abhinay acha he
 Tamannaah is also good in the film

 sajid kii koshish hoti he, masala film banane kii, jisamen har tarah kaa tadakaa maujuud ho
 Although many scenes in the film are quite dramatic, which seems strange, but since it was such a cinema hit in those times, they have to be ignored
 kul milakar kah sakate hai ki yah 80 ke dashak kaa laud cinema he, jise aaj ke daur main pesh kiya gaya he
 If you like cinema of that era, 'himmatwala' will suit you

 “I was surprised to find myself speaking like a Pakistani
 pakistaniyon ko jaraa-bhi andeshaa nahin hua ki ve kisi bhartiya se baat kar rahe hai
 The colonel posted in Pankaj Kanwar, Kanpur, till the start of Kargil war in 1999, India's intelligence agencies were completely unaware of the bases and activities of Pakistani military groups
 bhartiya sena ne jab yuddh shuru kiya tha to uske paas tha mahaj purana pad chukaa order of battle yaa orbet (sainya rachana or sainikon ke thikaane), jo use research and analysis wing (ro) or military intelligence (emi) ne muhaiyaa karavaaya tha
 Intelligence began to gather a little when an Indian military officer disguised a Pakistani officer and directly rang the phone at Pakistani bases and obtained intelligence about their activities
 karnal pankaj kanvar bataate hai ki may se july 1999 ke bich unhone pakistani paidal sena or bakhtarband ikaayiyon main lagbhag 6,000 phone kol kiye the
 Through brief talks, he found out about the activities of Pakistan Army, postings, casualties and its morale
 isi se bhartiya sena ko apane parmaanu shaktisampann dushman kii sainya gatividhiyon ke bare main pataa chal sakaa tha
 Based on some similar intelligence, the Indian Army had assessed that Pakistan was not willing to pursue the dispute beyond Kargil
 abhi kanpur main tainaat kanvar naaraaz hai ki oparation dial hard main unhen koi yathochit shrey nahin mila he
 On 12 June this year, he made military chief General V
V
 ke
 a detailed complaint letter has been sent to Singh in this regard, which is the latest in a series of letters sent in the last decade
 is patr main kanvar ne shikaayat kii he ki varisht adhikariyon ne unke yogadan ko nazarandaaj kar sara shrey khud le liya
 In May 1999, the head of MI25 at Military Intelligence (pakistan Desk), Brig Rakesh Goyal, asked Kanwar, who was then the Major, to call in Pakistani units to extract information
 kargil kii barf se ladi oonchi chotiyon ko pakistani hamalaavaron ke kabje se mukt karwaane or use phir se apane adhikaar main lene ke liye bhartiya sena oparation vijay pehle hi shuru kar chuki thi
 The mi's agents were unable to cross the border due to heavy deployment
 bhartiya sena yah jaananaa chaahati thi ki bhartiya hamale ke jawaab main pakistan ke orbet main kya badlaav kiye gaye hai
 Kanwar had placed the phones from an STD booth located within the Delhi cantonment at the telephone centers of the Pakistan Army
 pehali kamyaabi mili 4 june, 1999 ko peshawar sthit sainya unit ko lagaae gaye kol main
 Kanwar writes, "I never looked back after this
 '' kabhi 'major ikbaal' banakar to kabhi 'major hasan' banakar shuddh punjabi bolte hue ve kisi vishesh sainya thikaane main phone lagane ke liye kehete
 Once the operator had given a phone to that unit, they would have asked the name of an imaginary military officer to talk to him
 ve phone ke duusari ore baithe vyakti kii ore se di ja rahi harek choti-badi jaankaree ko bahut dhyaan se sunate or yah pataa laga lete ki vah koun-si unit he, uskaa thikaana kahaan he or kya vah apane thikaane se hati he yaa nahin
 Kanwar used the code given to talk to 'special' civilians in military establishments to talk in almost all bases and units of the Pakistani army, even at remote military bases like Bannu and Kohat
 kanvar yaa to daftar khulne se pehle alssubah phone karte yaa phir dopaher baad us vakt phone karte jab daftar main adhikari nahin hote
 To extract every information, small and big, he would tell himself of different ranks like non-commissioned officer, duty babu and junior officer
 unhen mili safaltaaon main se ek vah jaankaree thi jisase pataa chalaa ki peshawar sthit 11veen palaton or queta sthit 12veen palaton ko bharat ke saath lagi seemaa par tainaat kiya gaya he
 He also discovered that "about 50 per cent of the orbate we have relating to Pakistani bases was wrong
" ''kanvar ne nordan lite infentry adhikari captain majarullah khan ke lahore sthit ghar main bhi phone lagaaya
 His phone number was found by Indian soldiers from a bunker located on the hills of Kargil
 kargil se bachaae gaye ek ghayal yuva adhikari se baat karne par kanvar is nattejey par pahunche ki kargil kii chotii par kabja jamaane vaala koi or nahin balki pakistani sena hi he
 Kanwar did not record any of his conversations, but the complete details of every conversation were definitely recorded in one of his files
 yuddh ke baad kanvar ko bataaya gaya ki unke is kaam kaa ullekh nahin kiya ja saktaa kyonki isse emi25 or yuddh kshetra ke ird-gird tainaat khufia uniton kii taiyaariyon par galat prabhaav padegaa
 Senior officials of Kanwar did not inform the Director General of MI or the army chief about his contribution
 kanvar katutaa se isliye bhare hai kyonki unke seva record main kargil yuddh main unke yogadan kaa zikr tak nahin he
 In his letter to the army chief, Kanwar wrote, "it was described as Brigadier Goyal's plan and not only that it was said that the officers who approached the Pakistani Army during the war were someone else, my contribution was suppressed
 And its importance was reduced
 ''tatkaaleen sena pramukh general ve
 P
 malik kehete hai, ''is maamle ke bare main maine pehle kabhi nahin suna
 Why be rewarded for carrying out the responsibility given to an officer? Awards are given only for work done outside of responsibility
 ''kanvar ke vakil tii
 K
 joseph kehete hai, ''yuddh ke bich main kanvar ne jo kuch kiya vah asaadhaaran kaam tha
 Kanwar used his intelligence to find out the quick and real movements of the soldiers
 '' pichley saal armd forces tribunel ne kanvar kaa maamla dekhne se is aadhaar par inkaar kar diya tha ki uske paas ''maamle ke gun-dosha kaa moolyankan karne ke liye visheshgyon kii kami he

 Dhawan completed his 100 runs off 110 balls only
 srilanka ke khilaaf ye unki duusari senchuri rahi
 It is after coincidence that Shikhar Dhawan's last Test century came two years ago against Sri Lanka in Gaul
 is dauraan dhawan ke balle se koi shatak nahin niklaa tha
 Dhawan became even more aggressive after the century
 dhawan ne apane kariyar kaa sarvshereshth pradarshan karte hue 168 gendon main 190 ran kii tufaani pari kheli
 In which he hit 31 fours
 is match se pehle tak unka best score 187 ran tha
 Cheteshwar Pujara, while supporting Pujara, with the help of Sanchashikhar Dhawan, also made excellent batting in the match and made his 12th career
 vahiin srilanka ke khilaaf ye unka doosraa shatak he
 Pujara hit 8 fours in his innings
 pehla wicket gir jane ke baad tisare number par khilne aae pujaara ne shikhar dhawan ke saath milakar pari ko sambhala or soch-samajhakar ballebaaji kii
 Pujara scored all around the field
