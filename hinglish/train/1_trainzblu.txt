 Devbhoomi Uttarakhand is not far behind due to this curse of the government system that has been in place for years
 pichley saal disambar main saamne aae ek survey ke anusaar uttarakhand main berozegaron kii sankhya nau lakh tak pahunchane vaali he
 About 5 of them
 53 lakh purush to 3
 45 lakh women are unemployed
 hairaan karne vaali baat ye he ki sabase adhik berozegaar dehradun main register hai
 According to statistics, the number of registered women unemployed in Dehradun is more than male unemployed
 yahaan 94,582 mahila berozegaar or 88,364 purush berozegaar register hai
 Both the BJP and the Congress were responsible - this issue of unemployment was raised by the opposition in the first budget session held in Bharabhadisain (garsain)
 haalanki rajya main bade berogari ke aankade ke liye congress or bijepi donon hi jimmedaar he
 The result of this is that the youth here today have lost hope with the governments, and are fighting for their rights by displaying disappointment on the streets
 sachivalay par hallaa bol-natijatan asthai rajdhani dehradun main somvaar kouttarakhand berozegaar sanghake saikadon yuvaaon ne baari taadaat main rajya kii trivendra sarkaar ke khilaaf mahareli nikaali
 This Maharaeli of these youth, filled with despair and waiting, was about to leave the secretariat
 haalanki isse pehle hi baari police bal dwaara pradarshnakariyon ko bericating lagaakar roak diya gaya, is dauraan berozegaar sangh ne rajya sarkaar ke khilaaf jamkar narebaaji karte hue pradesh ke yuvaaon ke khilaaf andekhi kaa aarope lagaaya
 What is the charge - Uttarakhand Unemployed Association alleges that the government is not hearing any vacant posts in the departments, no examinations are being conducted on the release of the posts issued for months
 sarkaar rojgaar dene ke naam par pradesh ke shikshit yuvaaon ko gumraah kar rahi he
 Like the people of the state are being caught lollipops in the name of the capital
 aise main jis tarah seyuva sadakon par utar aae hanusako dekhakar ye andaja lagaana kaaphi he ki berozegaar yuva varg ab hallaa bol chukaa he
 This cannot be considered a good sign for the upcoming Lok Sabha elections in 2019, so now Trivendra Singh Rawat and his government need to think really seriously and also find some solution by adopting the right path, because the youth is there
 Which changes the fate of the country and the upcoming elections of Uttarakhand are also in the hands of the youth class to a large extent, which is constantly slipping

 The politics of Bihar seems to be taking a new turn
 bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ke netritv vaale endie main sabakuch thik nahin chal rahaa he
 While Bihar Chief Minister and Janata Dal United (JDU) president Nitishkumar succeeded in making the BJP work, now the RRSPK president Upendrakushwahane has given the formula to make 'political kheer'
 iske liye unhone yaduwanshiyon or kushavanshiyon ke gathjod ke sanket die hai
 But the question is whether the union of the two will dissolve the sweetness in Kheer? In Bihar politics, Nitish Kumar left Lalu Prasad Yadav and joined the NDA again in 2017
 rajya main bijepi nitish kumaar ko bada bhai bhi maanane ke liye raji najar aa rahi he
 In such a situation, the deepening friendship between Nitish and BJP is not appealing to Upendra Kushwaha, who became Modi's partner in 2014
 dushman kaa dushman dost hota he kii kahawat ko charitaarth karne kii kavayad bihar main ho rahi he
 Upendra Kushwaha, a minister in the Modi government, has hinted at an alliance with RJD in gestures at BP Mandal's centenary celebrations in Patna two days ago
 kushvaha ne kaha, 'yaduwanshi (yadav) kaa doodh or kushavanshi (koiri samaaj) kaa chaaval mil jaae to kheer badhiya hogi or us swaadisht vyanjan ke banane se koi roak nahin saktaa he
 However, he further clarified that this Kheer will not be tasty unless it will be a panchmeva of small castes and downtrodden society
 yahi saamaajik nyaay kii asli paribhaasha he
 RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav tweeted and supported Upendra Kushwaha's statement
 tejasvi ne kaha he ki nisandeh swaadisht or paushtik kheer shramshil logon kii jarurat he
 The healthy qualities of Panchameva give energy not only to the body but also to the creation of a healthy equitable society
 prem bhav se banaai gai kheer main paushtikta, swaad or urja kii bharpoor maatra hoti he or yah ek acha vyanjan he
 To defeat the BJP in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav is trying to bring OBC, Muslim and Dalit votes as well as OBC votes this time
 jabaki vahiin endie main nitish kii entry ke baad upendra kushvaha ke liye bahut zyada raajnneetik jagah bachi nahin he
 Kushawaha in Ace is also looking for a strong political partner
 upendra kushvaha or lalu prasad yadav ek duusare ke liye turup kaa patta sabit ho sakate hai
 Upendra comes from the Kushwaha Koiri society, with nearly 3 per cent of this community's vote in Bihar
 jabaki lalu prasad yadav kaa mul vot bank yadav or muslim hai
 Muslims and 14 percent of Bihar's total population
 4 fisadi yadav aabaadi he
 Apart from this, Lalu has a strong base among the Dalits and backward
 aise main kushvaha or laal yadav saath aate hai to rajya ke ek majboot siyaasi sameekaran ban saktaa he
 In view of this, Tejashwi Yadav has been constantly praising Upendra Kushwaha
 vahiin, kushvaha bhi lalu yadav se apane rishte majboot karne ke liye vakt-be-vakt milte rahe hai
 Let me tell you that when the BJP announced the name of Narendra Modi for 2014, Nitish Kumar broke away from the NDA and joined hands with Lalu Yadav
 aise main bijepi ne bihar ke chote chote dalon ko apane saath lekar 2014 ke ran ko fatah kiya tha
 These included Upendra Kushwaha's National Lok Samata Party (RLSP) and Ram Vilas Paswan's Lok Janshakti Party
 bijepi ke saath gathbandhan kaa nateeja ye rahaa ki RLSP ke teen loksabhaa sadsy jeetne main safal rahe or jab modi sarkaar bani to upendra kushvaha ko mantri pad se nawaja gaya
 Last year, PM Narendra Modi gave Nitish Kumar a big political defeat by separating him from the Grand Alliance and joining Lalu Yadav
 aise main argedy bhi modi se hisaab baraabar karnaa chaahati he
 RJD has given a jolt to BJP by joining former Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi from NDA
 maanjhi ke baad ab koiri samudaay se aane vaale upendra kushvaha ko milakar argedy bijepi se hisaab baraabar karnaa chaahati hai
 At the same time, Kushwaha also wants to calculate his political rivalry with Nitish Kumar
 lekin dekhnaa hoga ki yaduwanshiyon or kushavanshiyon ke gathjod se banane vaali siyaasi kheer kitni mithi hogi?

 Union Energy Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde was promoted and given a very important department like Home Ministry just hours after leading the biggest power blight in Indian history
 is gambhir bijli sankat se july ke antim do dinon main samooche uttar or purvi bharat main 16 ghante tak ghupp andhera chaaya rahaa or isse kareeb 67 karod log prabhavit hue
 Shinde's progress is a matter of grave concern for the country
 ek grih mantri ke rup main unhen aadhi-adhuri khufia soochnaaon ke aadhaar par hi bharat ke khilaaf rachi ja rahi jatil aatanki sajishon kaa purvanumaan kar unhen rokna hoga
 As Union Energy Minister, Shinde could not anticipate, or stop, the 3 out of 5 national power grids in the country completely, even though he was clear about such a crisis
 scindia ke saamne chetavanee kii lalabatti lagaataar jal rahi thi
 But either he was sleeping while in office or he took very wrong steps
 kareeb chah saal tak urja mantri rahe scindia jaanate the ki desh hameshaa se hi bijli sankat se jujhta rahaa he
 According to the government's own estimates in the Economic Survey presented in March 2012, there is a difference of about 8% in the demand and supply of electricity, which increases to 10% in peak time
 scindia yah bhi jaanate the ki monsoon kii barish kam hone par bijli kii maang teji se bad jaati he
 The monsoon rains have come down considerably in june-july, this information should be known to the minister
 unhen yah bhi pataa hoga ki aam taur par jab monsoon vifal rahata he to punjab, haryana or uttar pradesh kendriya pool se zyada bijli khinchate hai kyonki vahaan ke kisaanon ko sinchai ke liye pump set chalaane hote hai
 The central government is blaming the power crisis on these states
 kendriya vidyut niamak ayog (siiarasi) ke july ke aankadon se pataa chalata he ki rajasthan ke saath hi ye teenon rajya july madhya yani grid ke baith jane se kam-se-kam do hafte pehle se hi nirdhaarit cote se zyada bijli khinch rahe hai
 There was plenty of time to get the erring states on the way
 lekin scindia ke urja mantralay ne 12 july ko ek chetavanee-patr jari karne ke alaava kuch khaas nahin kiya
 After resigning from the ministry, when Shinde was asked for clarification, he was not interested in it
 ve bole, ''maine piemo ko jaankaree de di he
 In America, electricity was cut for four days, here we restored it within a few hours
 grid main jis tarah se kaam kiya gaya, logon ko uski tarif kerani chahie
 "shinde's engineers will probably be able to restore power supply, but it was Shinde who allowed such an incident to happen
" scindia kii banaai jaanch samiti sankat kii vajahon kaa pataa lagaaegi, jisaki vajah se 2001 ke baad pehali baar itnaa bada sankat aayaa
 Sources in the Ministry of Power say that there was overloading in the transmission line somewhere between Delhi to Agra and Agra to Gwalior
 isse shaq kii sui puri tarah se upi par jaati he, haalanki jab grid fail hua tab punjab, haryana or rajasthan bhi cote se zyada bijli le rahe the
 The officers of the power department of Uttar Pradesh knew that nothing would deteriorate them because Shinde's ministry had never strictly imposed any punishment for such indiscipline
 badakismati se vittiya dand lagaae jane par bhi koi rajya usase darane vaala nahin kyonki maujuuda niyamon ke mutabik rajyon ko cote se zyada bijli khinchne ke liye prati kilowat-ghanta 1
 65 Rs
 kaa jurmaana dena hoga
 While power on open exchanges is around Rs 9
 prati unit bikati he
 That is, there is no harm to states in breaking the discipline of the grid and also in paying the fine
 siiarasi ne march, 2012 main hi sujiya tha ki grid main anushaasanheenata ke liye vittiya dand ko badhaayaa janaa chahie, lekin urja mantralay abhi tak in sujhaavon par nirnay nahin le paaya he
 The sensible solution would be to increase the penalty and adopt a system in which money is to be taken in advance from the states purchasing electricity from the central pool
 ek or majboot samaadhaan he jise scindia lagu kar sakate the-ve yah aadesh de sakate the ki jin rajyon ne galati kii aadat bana lee he, unka patta kendriya grid se kaat diya jaae
 But political weakness will never allow this to happen
 urja mantralay ke ek adhikari ne kaha, ''kya aap sach main aisi kalpana kar sakate hai ki scindia mulaayam singh ke uttar pradesh kii bijli kaat den?'' congress apane sahyogi dalon ke saamne to akasar kaayar ban jaati he
 Especially at this time, when he relies on Mulayam Singh to save his power
 bijli kii maang or aapurti ke bich kii badhati khai ko paatane ke liye scindia ko 6 saal kaa kaarykaal mila, par is maamle main unki uplabdhi behad kharaab he
 During his tenure, power generation capacity grew by 50 per cent, but actual production grew by only 17 per cent
 sabase badi samasya desh ke thermal power steshnon ko koyale kii samuchit uplabdhta na ho paanaa he
 About 65 percent of the country's total electricity generation is dependent on coal
 jab monsoon kii barish kam hoti he to koyale par yah nirbharta or bad jaati he
 Take the example of Anpara Thermal Power Project located in Sonbhadra, Uttar Pradesh
 is project main sthit do sanyantron kii kul bijli utpaadan kshamta 1,630 megawatt he
 Anpara generated an average of 1,300 MW of electricity daily in June and July, which is about 20 per cent less than its total capacity
 is plant se jude uttar pradesh power korporation ke ek varisht adhikari ne bataaya ''anapara ko roj 25,000 ton koyale kii jarurat he par in garmiyon main use roj 20,000 se 21,000 ton koyala mila
 '8 in India at present
 5 karod ton koyale kii kami he
 Coal India Limited has consistently argued that the environment ministry's decision to set up no-go areas for coal mining of large areas of forests is failing to increase production
 paryaavaran mantri ke taur par jairam ramesh infrastracchar or udyogon ke hit main kisi tarah kii riyaayat dene se inkaar karte rahe
 But according to his style of UPA, the Prime Minister promoted him as Cabinet Minister for Rural Development in July 2011 so that he could be easily removed from the Ministry of Environment
 tab tak ramesh ne ek tarah se nai koyala khadaanon par taala hi lagava diya, jise unke baad paryaavaran mantri banane vaali jayanti natarajan bhi nahin palat pai hai
 Coal India and its boss Coal Minister Sriprakash Jaiswal are no less guilty
 kuch jaankaron kaa kahana he ki kol india un ilaakon main to khanan kar sakati he jo 'no-go' ke antargat nahin aate hai, lekin nakadi se labalab ekadhikaar vaali is company ko aisa karne kii jarurat bahut kam lagati he
 Jaiswal did little to quell the management of Coal India and did not take any action that would give it some competition
 aaayaatit koyala kaaphi mahangaa hota he
 As Energy Minister, Shinde failed to convince his colleagues that there was an urgent need to increase coal supply
 scindia, jaiswal or natarajan kii upasthiti vaali ek antar-mantralayan baithak main maujuud rahe ek varisht adhikari ke anusaar scindia kaa koi asar nahin tha
 "he remained completely silent while the other ministers were talking," said the official
 ''bijli sankat kii mukhya khalanaayak centre sarkaar hi he, lekin rajyon ne bhi isamen ahm bhoomika nibhaai
 The bankrupt State Electricity Board is at the center of the power crisis
 sabhi rajya bijli bordon kaa kul ghaataa kareeb ek lakh karod ru
 Which is equal to one percent of the country's GDP
 inke diwalia hone kii vajah sabko acchhee tarah maaloom he
 Firstly, on an average, 30 per cent of the supply from the State Electricity Boards is lost
 yah bijli yaa to chori ho jaati he yaa kharaab infrastrakhchar kii vajah se li hokar barbaad ho jaati he
 In the electricity boards that have been privatized, the losses in this way have been reduced
 masalan kolkata ke siiessi ne is tarah ke nuksaan ko ghataakar 10 fisadi ke neeche kar liya he
 The politics of giving free and subsidized electricity further increases the burden
 uttar pradesh main bijli aapurti kii laagat 6 ru
 Cost per unit, but 3 from consumers for this
 5 ru
 Only one unit is taken
 mayawati ke netritv vaali uttar pradesh sarkaar ne apane 5 saal ke kaarykaal main bijli kii daren do baar badhaai thim
 But Akhilesh, who is on a populist path, has now denied any hike in electricity prices
 hameshaa bijli sankat kaa saamana karne vaale ek or rajya tamilnadu main 2011 main jayalalita ke satta main aane se pehle nau saal tak bijli daron main koi badhat nahin kii gai thi
 The failure to revise electricity rates also shows the helplessness of independent power regulators
 ek varisht adhikari kehete hai, ''unase sarkaar se swatantra kaary karne kii ummid kii jaati he, lekin zyaadaatar maamalon main ve aisa nahin karte
 The State Electricity Board of Rajasthan alone received 46,000 crore rupees
 kaa ghaataa ho chukaa he
 The huge deficit means that the state no longer has any money to spend on power network expansion and is simply somehow able to sustain power generation
 bihar rajya bijli board ko 2011 main 1,600 karod ru
 Losses which is double of 2007 losses
 mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ke saat saal ke kaarykaal main bihar sarkaar ne bijli utpaadan ke kshetra main kuch nahin kiya he
 It has not been able to increase even one MW in electricity generation
 bijli bordon kii vittiya haalat aisi nahin he ki ve kisi nijee utpaadakon se bijli kharid saken
 State governments do not have the money to build new power generation units
 nijee bijli utpaadakon ko bhi in rajyon main bijli unit lagane ke liye koi protsaahan nahin mil rahaa
 Therefore, the power board of the states has only one way to draw more power from its central allocation
 yah ek aisa dushchakr he jise zyaadaatar rajya nahin tod paa rahe
 Shinde got 6 years to overcome all the problems in the power sector
 lekin ve pad chhodane par khud hi behtareen pradarshan ke liye peeth thapthapate dikhe, jabaki janata upie-1 or upie-2 main unke kaarykaal main unke netritv se tabah rahi he
 -with Amitabh Srivastava, Ashish Mishra, Rohit Parihar and Devesh Kumar saat mahilaon ne gang banaakar ravivaar kii raat uttar-purvi dilli main ek kapade kii dukaan kaa shater todakar 15 lakh rupee kii chori kar lee
 The CCTV camera, which has full recording of the theft, is a boon of this theft incident
 in saat mahilaon main se ek ke paas god main baccha bhi he
 This incident happened in Zafarabad at around 4 am on Sunday morning
 is ghatana ke baad vyapaariyon main rosh he
 The police have registered a case and started searching for this gang
 kapadaa vyapaaree amanullah khan ne bataaya ki uski dukaan se 15 lakh rupee kii keval nakadi churaai gai he
 While the shop also had a mobile phone and expensive cloth
 unhone bataaya ki sisitivi footage police ko de di gai he
 It is clearly seen in the footage that a woman broke into the shop and broke the shutter and the other women started guarding all around
 vaardaat ko anjaam diya or vahaan se chali gayi
 After this incident, traders have expressed their anger against the police
 unhone bataaya ki police ko kai baar gasht badhaane ke liye kaha gaya he, lekin police ne aaj tak unki koi baat nahin suni, jiskaa nateeja yah chori he
 All the houses have idols and pictures of God but very few people will know that not all idols are auspicious
 vaastu ke anusaar, kai murtiyon aisi bhi hoti hai, jinke darshan karnaa manushya ke liye ashubh ban saktaa he
 We are going to tell you about some such images and idols of God, which is not considered good to see
 
 
 - bhagwaan kii murti ghar main is tarah rakhni chahie ki inke peeche kaa bhaag yani peeth dikhaai nahin de
 Visiting the back of God is not considered auspicious
 - puja sthal main ek hi bhagwaan kii do murtiyon rakhana bhi acha nahin hota he
 Especially if both idols are nearby or face to face
 aisi murtiyon ke darshan karne se baar-baar ladaai hoti he
 - No matter how deep a faith is attached to an idol, but if the idol becomes fragmented then it is not good to see it
 aisi murti ke darshan yaa puja karnaa ashubh hota he
 - In the temple, such a statue of God should be kept, in which his mouth is gentle and hands in the posture of blessings
 raudra or udhaas murti ke darshan karne se nakaaratmak urja aati he
 - Do not have to see any such idol of God, in which they are seen fighting or destroying someone
 aisi murti ke darshan karnaa bhi dukhon kii vajah ban sakate hai

 Union Minister Smriti Irani has targeted Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi directly from his constituency Amethi
 smriti ne kaha ki sansad main rohit vemula maamle par bahes ke dauraan unhone (smriti ne) rahul gandhi ko muskuraate hue dekha tha
 Significantly, earlier this year, the suicide case of Hyderabad student Rohit Vemula caused a big political controversy
 smriti ne NDTV kii barkhaa dutt se baatcheet main kaha, 'maine rohit vemula maamle kii bahes ke dauraan rahul gandhi ko muskuraate hue dekha tha jabaki yah aarope mujh par lagaaya gaya tha
 Smriti said this in response to a question strongly contradicting the opposition's allegation of her role in motivating research scholar Rohit to commit suicide
 unhone kaha ki ham ek mrit bachche ke bare main baat kar rahe the or vah muskuraate hue baithe the
 There should be such a Lakshman Rekha that as a human being we should not jump
 smriti ke anusaar, yah muskuraahat darshaati he ki congress upaadhyaksh ke liye rohit vemula keval raajnneetik mohara tha
 The comments kendriya mantri ne kaha, 'aakhir ve ek bachche kii maut par raajnneeti kaise kar sakate hai
 Yes, i would still call him a child
 ' gauratlab he ki 26 varshiya rohit vemula kaa shav 17 janvari ko hyderabad central uniwarsity ke hostel ke kamare main lataka hua paaya gaya tha

 Smriti said that her speech in Parliament was based on evidence and documentary facts
 unhone kaha, 'vipaksh ne poocha ki jo ve (smriti) kah rahi hai kya iske samarthan main sansad ke donon sadanon main saboot pesh kar sakati he

 ' Smriti said in a conversation with Barkha Dutt of NDTV, 'I saw Rahul Gandhi smiling during the Rohit Vemula case debate when i was accused of this
 ' smriti ne research scollar rohit ko khudakushi ke liye prerit karne main unki bhoomika ke vipaksh ke aarope kaa purajor tareeke se khandan karne sambandhi prashn ke jawaab main yah baat kahi
 He said that we were talking about a dead child and he was sitting smiling
 ek aisi lakshmana rekha honi chahie jo ek insaan ke taur par hamen langhna nahin chahie
 According to Smriti, this smile indicates that Rohit Vemula was the only political pawn for the Congress vice-president
 tippaniyan The Union Minister said, 'how can they do politics on the death of a child
 haa, main abhi bhi use baccha hi kahuungi
 'it is noteworthy that the body of 26-year-old Rohit Vemula was found hanging in the hostel room of Hyderabad Central University on 17 January
 yah ghatana rohit ko is aarope ke kaaran campus main pratibandhit kiye jane ke baad saamne ai thi ki usne bijepi kii student wing abivipi ke kaaryakartaaon par hamalaa kiya tha

 It has been decided to remove CBI Director Alok Verma from the post within less than 48 hours
 77 dinon tak ve chuttee par rahete hai, supreme court main sunwaayee hoti he, supreme court faisla karata he ki verma pad par behaal kiye ja sakate hai magar routine nirnay hi le sakate hai
 The high power committee will consider the reasons for which he was relieved of the post
 is hai power cameti main pradhanmantri modi, supreme court ke justise e ke sikari or vipaksh ke netaa mallikarjun khadge shaamil hote hai
 There is a meeting for two days and it is decided that Alok Verma is removed from his post
 un par lagaae gaye aarope sahi paae jate hai
 Alok Verma had ordered an FIR against his Number Two Special Director Rakesh Asthana last year
 un par 3 karod kii rishwat lene kaa aarope tha
 Asthana has petitioned the Delhi High Court to quash the FIR
 is yachika par abhi nirnay nahin aayaa he
 Asthana also accused Alok Verma that he was not allowing the investigation in the Moin Qureshi case to proceed
 alok verma ne 9 janvari ko pad sambhalate hue un adhikariyon ko waapas bulaane kaa aadesh kar diya jinka kaaryvahak nideshak em nageshwar raav ne 24 aktubar 2018 ko tabadalaa kar diya tha
 Gujarat cadre IPS brings AK Sharma back to the position of Joint Director
 em nageshwar raav ne sharma ko multi Disciplinary Monitoring Agency (MDMA) main bhej diya tha
 DIG Anish Prasad, sent to the Personal Department, is again brought to the Surveillance Unit
 diaiji em ke sinha ko bhi waapas laane ke aadesh karte hai
 Sinha had alleged in the Supreme Court that National Security Adviser Adit Doval was interfering in Asthana's case
 andaman bhej die gaye dspi e ke bassi kii bhi dilli mukhyalay main vaapasi hoti he
 Now what will happen to these orders of Alok Verma
 do din main 18 tabadale kar die
 Many officers could not join even after transfer
 khaskar ajit dowaal par dakhal dene ke aarope lagane vaale em ke sinha ne bhi jwine karne se inkaar kar diya
 Then they are ordered to transfer to a new position
 teen maheene baad ye log phir se dilli mukhyalay bulaae gaye hai, kya ab ye phir se waapas kar die jaaenge
 Verma has made 18 transfers
 unke faisle ke khilaaf dspi devendra kumaar ne dilli hai court main yachika daali he ki in faislon par roak lagaai jaae
 a hearing on this is scheduled for Friday
 mana ja rahaa tha ki in faislon se verma sanket de rahe the ki ve sarkaar se takaraa rahe hai
 But were they not doing this, Verma was not implementing the spirit of the Supreme Court order in which the court has said that the head of the CBI, especially the director, should be a role model of honesty and freedom
 aisa vyakti hi sabhi prakaar ke bahari niyantranon or dakhlandaaziyon se sanstha kii swaittata sunishchit kar saktaa he
 For this it is necessary that all types of institutions should be prevented from interfering in the work of CBI Director
 jab kalpana yah he ki sibiai kaa nideshak eemaandaar hoga or sabhi prakaar ke bahari dabaavon se mukt hokar swatantra faisle legaa tab yah kaise kaha ja saktaa he ki alok verma sarkaar se takaraa rahe the
 However, the High Power Committee has transferred Alok Verma
 31 janvari ko verma ritair hone vaale hai
 Rakesh Asthana is currently on leave
 unka kya hoga, saaf nahin he
 Rahul Gandhi had tweeted that the government is in a hurry to remove Verma because there is a fear that Verma should not order an inquiry into the Rafale case
 apane hathaaye jane ke nirnay tak verma ne aisa kuch nahin kiya
 In May 2013, the Supreme Court itself called the CBI a parrot
 janvari 2019 main aap tay karenge ki is pinjre main kya ho rahaa he
 The Supreme Court had said that the CVC whose report was transferred on the basis of it was stopped but left the right to decide on the basis of the election committee
 usee report ke aadhaar par faisla hua hoga jisaki maang mallikarjun khadge ne kii thi
 Neeta Sharma said that the CBI director has never been removed in this way
 nita ne bataaya ki nae pramukh ke chunaav ke sarkaar ne 20 afasaron kaa panel bana liya he jinamein se kisi ek ko pramukh chunaa jayega
 The CVC also has a complaint about Asthana, which was made by Alok Verma
 us shikaayat kaa kya hoga
 Alok Verma has been removed within 36 hours
 aapako yaad hoga jab alok verma ne rakesh asthana ke khilaaf exiaar karne ke aadesh die the tab aadhi raat ke baad mukhyalay ko gherva kar nae kaaryvahak nideshak nageshwar raav ko charge lene ke liye bheja jaataa he
 Verma is sent on leave
 aaj phir se alok verma hataa die gaye
 The last ones were removed after midnight and this time before midnight
 ek nideshak ko hataane kii itani jaldi kya thi, aisa kya ho gaya ki jis alok verma ko salect cameti ne chif banaaya usee ne ritairement se 21 din pehle hataa diya
 What a director could do in this 21 days
 ye sab sawaal goonjte rahenge magar dilli raat ko jab faisle leti he to taron ko dekhakar roshni kaa andaaza nahin karnaa chahie
 Stories will become longer than night
 baaten gumti rahengi
 What will be the answer to the question about which the CBI itself has said in the court that it had become the base of recovery

 paanch maheene pehle jab supreme court ne mumbai main dance baar ko phir se chaalu karne kaa hukum diya, to laga ki jald hi mayanagari kii nite life phir se badal jaaegi
 The lock of legal intricacies on the closed dance bar has been such that even the Supreme Court was not opened
 lihaaja is baar supreme court ne maharashtra sarkaar ko fatkaar lagaate hue kaha he kibhikh maangane se acha heki mahilaayein dance baar main kaam karen
 With this, the Supreme Court ordered that out of 150 dance bars, at least 8 dance bars should be operational within the next one week

 But this year, the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly passed a law against dance bars, suddenly the shutters of all dance bars fell

 Five months have passed since the country's highest court, the Supreme Court, was ordered to reopen the dance bars in Mumbai
 maharashtra sarkaar ne rakhi thim shartedance baar maalikon kii ek fariyaad par sunwaayee karte hue 26 november 2015 ko hi supreme court ne maharashtra sarkaar se phir se dance baron ko kholane kii ijaajat dene kaa hukum diya tha

 dance baar ke liye nae sire se fire sefti or duusare linsense hasil karne ko bhi jaruri bataaya gaya
 Even at first the banning of alcohol in the dance bar was banned

 Working in the dance bar better than begging on the street, the court said, commenting on the government's attitude, "it is better to have a woman work in the dance bar than begging on the road and earn money through other wrong ways

 The deadlock between Shiv Sena and BJP in Maharashtra is finally resolved
 shivasena ab pradesh kibijepi sarkaar main shaamil hogi
 According to information from the sources, he can be given five cabinet minister posts and 7 ministers of state
 khabaron ke mutabik, upmukhyamantri kaa pad shivasena ko nahin diya jayega
 Shiv Sena mlas may take oath of office on Wednesday
 haalanki is par shivasena kii aakhri muhar lagani baaki he
 Remember that before the Maharashtra elections, the old alliance between BJP and Shiv Sena was broken
 chunaav prachaar ke dauraan shivasena ne bijepi ke liye 'shraadh ke kauwe' jaise talkh shabdon kaa istemaal kiya tha
 During the election campaign, Prime Minister Narendra Modi also called Shiv Sena as 'haftavasuli Party' and NCP as 'naturally Corrupt Party'
 lekin sadan main fadanvis sarkaar ne ensipi ke samarthan se 'vivaadit' vishwaas mat hasil kar liya
 The Shiv Sena termed this trust vote as 'fake' and there was a lot of uproar in front of the Governor's car
 lekin kuch ucchstareey baithkon ke baad bijepi or shivasena ke bich sab kuch thik bataaya ja rahaa he
 This is probably the first time that the major opposition party of a state is going to directly join the government
 shivasena ko grih, awaas, rajasav or urja jaise bade vibhaag nahin milenge
 They can be replaced by departments like water conservation, industry and PWD
 shivasena grih vibhaag chaahati thi, lekin use grih rajya mantri kaa pad mil saktaa he
 There is also news that Shiv Sena may also get an additional ministerial post at the center
 isse pehle donon partiyon ke bichgatirodh sulajhane kii pushtiusi vakt ho gai thi jab somvaar ko mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis ne kaha tha ki maamle par 80 fisadi baatcheet ho chuki he
 The CM had suggested that those who are not connected to the conversation should not speak anything in the matter
 somvaar ko donon partiyon ke bich hui baithak ke dauraan fadanvis sarkaar ke kuch cabinet mantri bhi maujuud the
 Senior BJP leader and Union Minister Dharmendra Pradhan, State Cooperative Minister Chandrakant Patil held talks with Uddhav Thackeray for about an hour and a half before the Shiv Sena leaders met with Fadnavis on Sunday night, but neither side officially said anything
 
 iske alaava bijepi ke varisht netaa subramanyam swami ne bhi uddhav thakare se mulaakaat kii thi
 Significantly, the government of Shiv Sena and BJP was first formed in Maharashtra in 1995 and at that time Shiv Sena made Manohar Joshi as Chief Minister, while the post of Deputy Chief Minister was given to bjp's Gopinath Munde

 lekin beetaa saal bharat kii is amuly dein ko vaishvik patal par waapas laane vaala rahaa, jab duniya ne yoga ko khule man se sweekaar kiya or 21 june antarrashtriya yoga diwas ghoshit hua

 Earlier, Yoga Day was celebrated on different dates according to the convenience on a small scale by some yoga gurus in their institutions
 haalanki is abhiyaan kii shuruyaat 27 sitambar 2014 ko hi hui thi jab pradhanmantri narendra modi ne sanyukt raashtra mahasabha ko sambodhit karte hue kaha tha, ‚Äúyoga bhartiya puraatan parampara kii amuly dein he

 lekin yoga ko vaishvik str par punarsthapit kar uske praneta bane bharat main vivaad bhi jamkar hua
 Initially, the controversy arose about Patanjali Yogpeeth founder Swami Ramdev being invited to the Rajpath program
 haalanki ramdev ne isamen shirkat kii or manch par bhi unhen jagah mili
 Modi government sent External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj and Art of Living founder Sri Sri Ravi Shankar to America to make it a success
 lekin bharat main yoga diwas kaa vivaad majahabi ho gaya
 The All India Muslim Personal Law Board opposed the Surya Namaskar posture of yoga and termed it as a Hindu agenda
 aarope yahaan tak laga ki modi sarkaar ne sangh ke agenda ko aage badhaane ke liye hi antarrashtriya yoga diwas kii pahal kii he
 But this posture was kept out of the ceremony due to controversies
 yoga diwas ke bhavy aayojan se thik pehle 21 june kii taarikh ke chayan par bhi sawaal uthe
 It has been alleged that the Modi government has chosen this date for the purpose of honoring the founder of the Sangh, Keshav Baliram Hedgewar, as Hedgewar's death anniversary is also celebrated on this day
 lekin baad main sapsht hua ki 21 june saal kaa sabase bada din hota he isliye antarrashtriya yoga diwas ke liye is taarikh kaa chunaav kiya gaya he
 It was ironic for India that the country of yoga was backward in this case, whereas yoga business in the US has been worth $ 27 billion
 ab bharat ise swasth bharat kii kalpana ko saakaar karne or industry kaa rup dene main aage bad rahi he
 The very next day after the successful organization of Yoga, Union Human Resource Development Minister Smriti Irani announced the inclusion of Yoga in the school curriculum from sixth grade

 If we can take yoga properly to the people, then our health budget will also be reduced
 ‚Äùyani 2016 main sarkaar ise or vyapak banane kii ore bad rahi he
 Six central institutions are also being set up in the country, which are undergoing initiative to link them with international institutions
 beetaa saal yoga ko mukhyadhara main laane vaala rahaa to aane vaale saal 2016 main bharat bhi ek yoga industry ke rup main viksit hoga jisase prashikshit or kushal main power badhegi or rojgaar ke nae avasar paidaa honge

 What were the statements of Azam khan-maneka Gandhi, senior leader of Samajwadi Party and SP candidate from Rampur Lok Sabha seat, Azam Khan had given objectionable statement without naming Jaya Prada
 unhone kaha ki jisko ham ungali pakadakar rampur laae, aapane 10 saal jinase pratinidhitiv karaayaa, uski asaliyat samajhane main aapako 17 saal lage, main 17 din main pahchaan gaya ki inkaa undervier khaaki rang kaa he

 The Supreme Court has rejected the bail application of Lalu Yadav
 lalu yadav ne swasthya ke aadhaar par bel kii maang kii thi
 The decision of the Supreme Court has made it clear that Lalu Yadav will have to remain in jail
 ab jail kii balakani se hi lalu chunavi tamaasha dekhenge
 This is the first election after the establishment of RJD, in which Lalu Prasad Yadav will not be able to attend
 philhal wo ranchi ke rems main ilaaj kara rahe hai
 On behalf of RJD supremo Lalu Prasad in the Supreme Court, Kapil Sibal argued that the punishment given to him is going on separately, while according to the court's decision, the crime is the same
 lihaaja sajaa bhi ek saath chalani chahie
 On this, the Supreme Court said that it would not hear the merit in this case
 ye sunwaayee hoicourt karegaa
 Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi said that Lalu Prasad Yadav is guilty in many cases
 sabhi keson main sajaa ek saath chale yaa alag-alag chale, is par hoicourt vichaar karegaa
 Kapil Sibal said that there is no danger of Lalu Prasad Yadav getting out of jail
 is par sheersh adaalat ne kaha ki beshak khatra nahin hai, lekin lalu prasad yadav sazaayaftaa hai
 At the same time, after Lalu Yadav's application was rejected, RJD MP Manoj Jha said that Lalu Prasad is not well, he needs better medical care
 manode jha ne kaha ki court ke faisla ham sammaan karte hai, lekin phir bhi main kahuunga ki unhen behatar ilaaj kii jarurat he
 This is the first election for the people of Bihar after the 1980s which is being fought without Lalu Prasad Yadav
 rashtriya janata dal kii kaman unke haath main he lekin donon beton main hi aapas main hi nahin ban rahi he
 His elder son Tej Pratap has opened a front against RJD and Lalu is talking of taking candidates from two places by forming Rabri Morcha
 bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ab endie main hai
 The RJD does not have such a leader to surround the BJP and JDU in the same way as Lalu
 unke bete tejasvi mehnat kar rahe hai lekin bihar kii janata lalu ke bhaashanon ko miss kar rahi he
 Lalu wants to come out on health grounds but the CBI says that he will come out and do politics
 supreme court main buudhvaar ko hui sunwaayee main yah tay ho gaya he ki lalu jail main hi rahenge
 a bench headed by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi heard his bail plea
 bataa den 2019 loksabhaa chunaav main lalu yadav kii bhoomika abhi tak saamne nahin ai he
 If he had got bail, there was a possibility of changing the electoral equation in Bihar
 sibiai ne kaha ki yah aisa maamla he, jisamen jamaanat dene se ucch padon par bhrashtachar main sanliptata ke maamalon main bahut hi galat parampara padegi
 The CBI said that anyway Lalu Prasad Yadav has been in the hospital for more than eight months and is indulging in political activities
 sibiai ne apane jawaab main kaha yachikakarta (lalu yadav) ko uske aspataal main rahane kii avadhi main na sirf sabhi suvidhaon vaala vishesh ward diya gaya he balki ek tarah se vah vahaan se raajnneetik gatividhiyaan chalaa rahe hai, jo unase mulaakaat karne waalon kii suchi se spasht he
 The CBI said that Lalu Yadav claims to be so ill that he cannot stay in jail and needs to be hospitalized
 phir achaanak hi vah shaareerik rup se puri tarah thik ho gaye or jamaanat chaahate hai
 The CBI further said that Lalu Prasad has been convicted in four cases and has been sentenced to 168 months
 isamen se unhone abhi sirf 20 maheene kii hi sajaa puri kii he jo unhen sunai gai sajaa kaa 15 fisadi se bhi kam he
 The CBI said that in this way, according to Lalu Yadav's own statement, he does not fulfill the 'principle of Completion of Half Penalty' for suspension of sentence and bail
 rajd pramukh ne apni jamaanat yachika khaarij karne ke jharkhand ucch nyaayalay ke 10 janvari ke aadesh ko sheersh adaalat main chunauti di thi
 Let us know that Lalu Prasad has been convicted in three cases related to the fodder scam worth over Rs 900 crore
 rajd supremeo ko jharkhand main sthit devgarh, dumka or chibasa ke do koshagaar se chal se dhan nikaalane ke aparaadh main doshi tehraaya gaya he

 This year, the festival of Shri Krishna Janmashtami is being celebrated on 23 and 24 August

 Kanha, who enchanted the world with his Bal Leela, is called by his devotees Murali Manohar, Kanha, Krishna Murari, Nand Gopal, Makhan Chor, Devaki Nandan among many names

 Yes and that name is Ranchod

 aaie jaanate hai aakhir kyon duniya ko gita kaa upadesh dene vaale shri krishna ko ranchhod naam se bhi bulaayaa jaataa he
 This incident happened when Mahabali Magadharaj Jarasandha challenged Krishna to battle
 jaraasandh ne krishna ke saath yuddh karne ke liye apane saath kaal yavan naam ke raja ko bhi manaa liya tha
 Actually, Lord Shankar had given a boon to Kaal Yavan that neither Chandravanshi nor Suryavanshi would ever spoil him
 use naa to koi hathiyaar kharoch saktaa he or naa hi koi use apane bal se haraa saktaa he
 Kalayavan considered himself invincible after the boon he received from Lord Shankar
 jaraasandh ke kehane par kaalyavan ne bina kisi shatruta ke mathura par akraman kar diya
 Lord Krishna knew that Kalayavan cannot be killed
 unka surdarshan kaalyavan kaa kuch nahin bigaad saktaa
 After which he escaped from the battlefield and reached a cave
 shrikrishna or balram to bhaagate dekh jaraasandh un par hansane laga
 He had no knowledge of the opulence, influence etc
 of Lord Shri Krishna and Balramji

 jiske badale indra ne unhen vishram kaa aagrah kar ek vardaan bhi diya
 Indra said that whichever person wakes you from sleep will be burnt to death

 Lord Krishna brought Kaal Yavan to that cave, chasing after him
 jahaan raja muchkund soe hue the
 In the cave, Lord Krishna placed his Pitambara over King Muchkund
 kaalyavan ko laga shri krishna usase darkar andheri gupha main so gaye hai
 As Kalayavan kicked and raised the sleeping king Muchkund from the Treta Yuga

 He is a successful brand and his removal will push the team
 unki captaini bhi shandaar he
 It is difficult to find the captain of their collision

 Under SC / ST law, a court of Barmer was sent to jail by a court of Patrakatakopatnaki
 is maamle main shikayakarta kaa kahana he ki usne koi cese darj nahin karavaaya he lekin patna kii adaalat giraftaar kaa warrant jari kiya or police ne patrkaar kogiraftarkar 4 dinon kii nyaayik hiraasat main bhej diya
 Journalist Durg Singh Rajpurohit of Barmer, Rajasthan has been in the field of journalism for the last 18 years
 unka kahana he ki wo kabhibiharanheen gaye to phir kaise unke khilaaf anasuchit jati janajati kanoon ke tahat cese darj kar unhen jail bhej diya gaya
 It is believed that in this case he has been made a victim under some political conspiracy, which is yet to be revealed
 durg singh ko rajasthan police ne giraftaar kar patna police ko saunp diya tha
 On Tuesday, he was produced in court where he was sent to jail
 durg singh ne kaha ki unhen is maamle ke bare main kuch nahin pataa, unhen jab rajasthan police patna lekar ai tab unhen pataa chalaa ki kisi shaks ne unke khilaaf essi / asti kaa cese karaayaa he
 In which it was said that 'I (durg Singh) work as ballast sand while i have been in journalism work for the last 18 years and apart from that i did nothing
 mujhe rajnatik sajeesh ke tahat fansaaya ja rahaa he
 a case was filed against Durg Singh on 31 May, which was registered by a person named Rakesh Paswan of Nalanda
 isamen durg singh par aarope lagaaya gaya he ki wo use (rakesh paswan ko 6 maheene pehle mazdooree ke liye barmer le gaya tha, vahaan usase pathar kaa khanan karavaaya lekin paise nahin die
 In the first week of April, when his father was ill, he returned home
 15 april ko durg singh patna aayaa or rakesh ko barmer chalane ke liye kaha lekin usne aisa karne se inkaar kar diya
 After this, the fort started threatening him and on May 7, along with four people reached Digha Patna, abused Rakesh on the road and beat him with shoes
 2 june ko rakesh kaa court main bayaan darj hua, jiske baad court ne 9 july ko durg singh kigiraftaarika warrant jari kar diya
 Explain that the complainant was not present during the court hearing
 rajasthan se apane bete ke saath aaye durg singh ke pita gumaan singh raajpurohit kaa kahana he ki durg kabhi bihar gaye hi nahin to phir wo patna aakar kisi ke saath marpet kaise kar sakate hai
 In this whole case, advocate of Durg Singh says that the KC / ST law is being misused
 is maamle kii agali sunwaayee 1 sitambar ko hogi
 Railway Minister Lalu Yadav has demanded immediate ban on Bajrang Dal in view of attacks on churches and Christians in different parts of the country
 unhone bhartiya janata party, vishwa hindu parishad or bajrang dal ko desh ko todane vaali takat qaraar diya
 Lalu said that in order to garner Hindu votes, people of Sangh Parivar and BJP want to organize riots across the country including Orissa, Karnataka and Chhattisgarh
 unhone kaha ki isaayiyon par lagaataar hamale kiye jane se puri duniya main bharat kii badanaami ho rahi he
 Speaking to reporters after visiting Vindhwasini Devi on Vindhachal mountain on Saturday, he said that whoever works to break the unity of the country will be given a befitting reply from his party and the government
 hamaare sarkari tantra kii puraani imaarat beshak dhah chuki he or uske malbe se baahar nikalne ke liye chatapataahat bhi sab ore dikh rahi he, lekin hamaare bich kuch ashaavadiyon ko kaamkaaj ke ek nae or taaja model ke ubharne kii ummid hai
 It is also expected that our bureaucrats will play an important role in this change, which are important parts of our administrative machinery
 lekin badlaav laane ke liye afasaron ko maujuuda samay ke anusaar apane ko dhaalnaa hoga or khud ko behatar sabit karnaa hoga
 Such a possibility also looks bleak and there are signs of seriousness in it, but it would not be irresponsible to compare the old bureaucrats (such as around 1990) with the new shining stars of the present day administration, but it will shed light on new facts
 
 yah daawa karnaa bhi gaiyr-munasib nahin hoga ki puraane afasarshahon ke liye yah kartavya jaisaa tha, sirf naukari nahin
 In a developing country like India, it becomes a social and moral obligation to take care of those sections of society who are in dire need of help and to intervene immediately where necessary ‚Äî and this work can only do what this profession Consider it your duty 1990 ke dashak ke varisht afasaron ko maano akl kii dadh kii tarah hi shuru main hi iskaa ilm ho jaataa tha kyonki tab prashasnic seva kaa moolmantra hi janhit ke prati patibaddhta hota tha
 Today, even if you mention it to a most committed and responsible looking young officer, he starts shrugging
 aisa katai nahin tha ki puraane afasar koi sant the or unamem swaarth kii bhaavana hi nahin thi
 The only difference was that they had imbibed the view that the core of administrative service is public interest
 isamen koi andeh nahin ki 2014 kaa rajnatik janadesh ek nav-udaaravaadi vikaas model ke liye he
 a number of options can also be tried under this principle
 lekin aise vikalpon ko yuva afasaron ko janhit kii kasuti par kasnaa hoga
 Nearly half a century has passed since i was separated from the National Administrative Academy, but i would urge the young probationers there to renew their faith in the fundamental interest of the administrative service - public interest
 aaj kii sarkaar ke vaishvik nazariye ke saath talmail banaate hue afasaron ko vibhinn masalon kaa vishleshan karnaa chahie or aise vikalpon kii hi peshkash kerani chahie jisamen adhiktam janhit kaa khyaal ho
 Public interest is broadly political, unless it is interpreted in a wrong way
 yuva probationurs ko is salaah kaa matlab yah nahin hai ki ve hathiyaar uthaakar koi kranti karne nikal paden
 The government has a political ideology and the electoral mandate gives it the right to execute it
 haalanki, prashasnic tantra kaa ek chota hissaa hi vichaardhaara se sanchalit hota he‚Äîiske alaava usamen kaaphi gunjaaish hoti he ki aisi nitiyaan, yojanaayen or kaarykram banaae jaaen jinamein janhit kaa zyada se zyada khyaal rakhaa ja sake
 Today's administrative service officers have better training than senior officers of the 1990s
 bahut se yuva adhikari khud ko saunpe gaye kaam main apane kaushal kaa kaaphi prabhavi tareeke se istemaal bhi karte hai
 However, for older people like us, the difference between these two generations of officials becomes clear when priorities are set and choices are exercised at the social level
 janhit ko pradhantaaj ke shashan kaa ek pahalu yah lagata he ki saamaajik kshetra (praathmik swasthya seva, praathmik shiksha, nunatam poshan, mahila evam bal vikaas, kamajar tabakon kaa saamaajik-aarthik utthan jaise masale) uske daayre se baahar ho gaya he
 The youth, at least those who have become IAS, must have suffered a huge deficiency in the early years of their career
 hamaare pratibhashali yuva probationurs ne yah baat jarur mahasoos kii hogi ki hamaari vikaas kii ranneeti or aabaadi ke bade tabake kii jaruraton ke bich baari khai he
 Today, the government is giving a lot of importance to the business and corporate world
 unki jaruraton or nazariye ko nitiyon ke nirmaan main kaaphi jagah di jaati he
 The underprivileged do not get any representation
 yadi koi prashasnic adhikari janhit ke apane dharm kaa paalan karata he, to use aise kadam bhi uthaane honge jinase aise logon ko nitiyon main jagah mili jinka pratinidhitiv hi nahin ho paata he
 We are hearing that young officers are dazzled by technology and modern businessmen because it has been accepted as the standard of progress
 ham yahi samajhate hai ki desh ko vaishvik mahashakti banane ke liye zyada-se-zyada aarthik tarakkee jaruri he
 But our young friends of the administrative service should also explore how they can incorporate public interest in it
 yah bhi gauratlab he ki jahaan ghotaalon kii bharmaar ho, prashasnic seva ke adhikariyon ke liye nishtha or eemaandaaree ahm gun ho jate hai
 The old administration was convinced of the clear price legislation of its era
 unke liye nishtha, khaskar vittiya eemaandaaree kaa mahatv sarvaadhik tha
 It is also worth noting that the chances of financial misconduct in the 1990s were negligible compared to today
 aaj badi sankhya main aise sarkari saude hote hai jo kaaphi sandigdh hote hai-kuch main to amoort sampatti shaamil hoti he jinamein keemton ke nirdhaaran ke liye bazaar main len-dein kii misaal nahin hoti or bikri ke kai saude aisi keemton par hote hai jinka nirdhaaran manamaane dhang se kiya jaataa he
 In such circumstances administrative tasks have become more complex
 haalanki, jo log iraadaa rakhte hai, unke liye atirikt kanoonee phaayde hasil karne ke avasar bhi hai
 It cannot be denied that examples of financial crime are now being found in Ifrat
 hamen is sachaai ko sweekaar karnaa chahie, haalanki hamamen se bahut log isse inkaar karte hai or ‚Äòeemaandaaree ke abhaav‚Äô ko ek asansadeey shabd jaisaa maanate hai jise kabhi jubaan par nahin laayaa janaa chahie
 Therefore, the current generation of administrative service officers must decide what methods and procedures are to be used to work in such a complex system of governance today, so as to what results without public disputes arising out of embarrassing irregularity
 Can be given in kind
 phir hasil karen saakhisase inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa ki prashasnic seva kii saakh gart main ja chuki he
 In addition to hard evidence, credibility can also be gained from assumptions or lost
 aaj naukarshahi par bharosa lagaataar ghatata dikh rahaa he
 About half a century ago, as a young officer, i was often speechless, seeing how much of my integrity was being trusted, while many of the absurd decisions i might have made in haste and overconfidence
 iske vipareet aaj sahi nirnay ko bhi, jo samaaj kii bhalaai ke liye liya gaya ho, kuch vyaktigat hiton yaa bhai-bhatijawad kii vajah se chunauti di ja sakati he
 Ordinary citizens are cutting their own waste by ruining the unconditional trust fund that was gifted to the officers
 logon kaa bharosa jeetne ke liye kisi bade prabandhan kaushal kii jarurat nahin padati
 With the common qualities like compassion, fairness and equal attitude for everyone, every person of the society starts feeling comfortable and pleasant
 kaarobaari model ko hi ekmaatr mantra maanane se aisa saamaanya ravaiya bhi ab apraasangik hota ja rahaa he
 Today, no one trusts in public transactions
 1990 ke dashak or uske pehle ke daur kii puraani peedi ke afasarshahon ko desh ke logon se saakh uphaar main mili thi or unhone iskaa istemaal bhalaai ke liye kiya
 Young officers will have to achieve it again, no matter how much time and effort is required
 main is baat kii guarantee de saktaa hum ki ve ise apane peshewar kareer ke shreshth nivesh ke rup main paaenge
 So, this sermon of an older generation officer in the name of young officers should now end here
 farmaan dene kaa meraa koi iraadaa nahin he
 Undoubtedly, each generation tailors its professional personality according to its circumstances
 lekin sabhi tarah kaa samay dekh chukaa yah bujurg suzav dene kaa jokhim uthaata he ki upar jin sthaayee buniyadi mulyon kaa ullekh kiya gaya he ve kisi bhi paristhiti main, kisi bhi umr main praasangik bane rahenge

 Three national highways pass through this city, connected to Delhi, Noida, Faridabad, Ghaziabad, Haridwar, with ease

 New Meerut is developing on Haridwar Road where big real estate companies like Supertech, Ansal have reached
 meerut main pravesh karte hi ek nayaa mal jo do maheene pehle hi shuru hua he, shahar kii shaan ko badha rahaa he
 Satyendra Kumar Singh, vice-chairman of Meerut Development Authority (now transferred to DM Banda) says, "our effort is to make Meerut a satellite city of Delhi by improving the communication and transport system
" ‚Äô‚Äôve bataate hai ki is shahar kii sabase badi khaasiyat jameen ke bheetar se milane vaala meetha pani he or bhoojal kaa str kaaphi upar he isliye yah shahar logon ko lubhaata he
 According to Satyendra Kumar Singh, the development of this metropolis is facing obstacles due to poor transport system
 lekin meerut-dilli ke bich rapid rail transit system (ararties) kii adhyayan report (deepiar) taiyaar ho chuki thi
 In which its alignment was made from the middle of the highway
 lekin rashtriya rajmarg praadhikaran ne isaki manjuuri nahin di, isliye ab nae sire se is yojana par kaam ho rahaa he
 Apart from this, a ring road is being built by acquiring 100 acres of land to ease the movement in the metropolis
 pratham charan ke liye emd kii ore se raashi jari kii ja chuki he
 Separate transport city is being set up in Panchali village on Baghpat road for about 15,000 heavy trains

 Most of the world's cricketers play with the bats made here, so no Olympics is complete without the sports equipment made here

 The traditional scissors here cross the seven seas even today

 The city is, apparently, the second largest metropolis of NCR, which is famous worldwide for the manufacture of sporting goods

 Weakness: This metropolis is always in the limelight due to poor law and order

 Possibilities: Connecting meerut-delhi by Rapid Rail, airport at Paratapur, conversion of NH-58 to eight lanes will speed up the pace of development of Meerut

 is saal jahaan 2017 kii tulana main zyada aatanki maare gaye hai, to vahiin duusari ore desh main koi bhi bada aatanki hamalaa nahin hua

 suraksha balon ne elosi or uske najadik hui muthbhedon ke alaava jammu-kashmir ke andruni ilaakon main in aatankwaadiyon ko maar giraaya
 This figure is higher than last year
 2017 main jammu-kashmir main 213 aatankwaadi maare gaye the
 More than 50 militants were arrested this year, while five also surrendered
 ab bhi 240 aatanki sakriyakhufia agenciyon ke mutabik jammu-kashmir main ab bhi kareeb 240 aatanki sakriy hai
 These include some foreigners as well
 koun se bade aatanki maare gaeis saal suraksha balon se jammu-kashmir main sakriy abu matin, abu hamaas, samir ahamed bhat urf samir tiger, saddaam paddar, abu kasim, abu maavia, mannaan vaani, mehrajuddin bangaru, sabjar ahamed sophy, javed nat or jahur ahamed thokaar jaise aatankwaadiyon ko maar giraaya
 However, the security force of a terrorist named Zakir Musa is desperately searching
 koi bada aatanki hamalaa nahinis saal desh main jammu-kashmir ke alaava kahin koi bada aatanki hamalaa nahin hua
 In this regard, the year 2018 was safe for the country

 Amarnath Yatra was a challenge
 This year, Security Forces made many new strategies to improve security arrangements
 isi ranneeti kaa nateeja tha ki amarnath yatra ke dauraan koi badi aatanki ghatana nahin hui
 The security forces appealed to the terrorists' families this year to work on a new strategy
 sena or police ne kashmir ghati main sakriy main aatankiyon or unke parivaaravaalon se hathiyaar chhodane kii apil kii
 His appeal also had some effect when five terrorists announced to leave arms and join the mainstream

 jawahar laal nehru vishvavidhyalay (JNU) main 28 june ko Academic Council (asi) kii 151veen baithak hone ja rahi he
 JNU Student Union says that there is going to be a decision on Hindi in the meeting, which is not in the interest of the student
 ab JNU main hindi bhashaa ko lekar kyon uthaa vivaad, ye he puraa maamlajeenyu chaatrasangh ke adhyaksh en sai balaji kaa kahana he ki jeenyu prashasan 28 june ko hone ja rahi acadmic council kii baithak main snaatak str ke program main hindi ko anivaary karne ja rahi he
 He alleged that behind this, the JNU administration wants to implement the hidden agenda of the government and national volunteers, Hindi, Hindu, Hindustan
 unhone maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantralay (emecharadi) dwaara 2018 main sabhi vishvavidhyalayon ko jari ek aadhikarik patr kaa hawala diya he, jisamen hindi ko rashtriya bhashaa ke rup main ullikhit kiya gaya he
 Apart from this, instructions have been given to implement Hindi as a compulsory course in all graduate level programs
 ye he wo patr jeenyu student ne diya jiskaa hawalaasi baithak kaa agenda 16 jisamen diya gaya pointbana vivaad kaa vishayounushu President ne kaha, desh kii koi ek rashtriya bhashaa nahinstudent union kaa kahana he ki bharat main koi ek rashtriya bhashaa nahin he
 The eighth schedule of the country's constitution lists 22 official languages according to the diverse and multidimensional nature of the country
 balaji ne jeenyu kulapati par jabaran hindi bhashaa ko thopane kii yojana banane kaa aarope lagaaya he
 Bala ji said that today when the government is forced to revise its draft education policy and 3 language formulas under the pressure of the general public, it is condemnable by the JNU Vice Chancellor to make Hindi mandatory
 unhone kaha ki har kisi ko apni pasand kii bhashaa seekhney kaa adhikaar he
 No language is above any other in this country
 chaatro ko seekhney ke liye vikalp diya janaa chahie
 He said that no pressure on the language of the students will be tolerated
 unhone kaha ki JNUSU jabaran hindi ko thopane kaa virodh karata he
 At the same time, we demand the Vice Chancellor to drop agenda 16 of the meeting which advocates making Hindi compulsory at the undergraduate level
 agar phir bhi jabaran ise thopa jaataa he to jeenues shantipurvak dhang se ise lekar virodh karegaa
 As of now, no side has been placed on this matter from the JNU administration
 fasebuk utyub banane kii taiyaari main he or jald hi google kii video website youtube se bhi aage nikal jaae to koi hairaan kii baat nahin hogi
 This is because Facebook has started making youtube's coffin for the last few years
 ham aapako ek ek karke kuch points bataate hai jisase aapako andaja ho jayega, ki kaise fasebuk utyub ko takkar dene kii taiyaari main he
 Note that the world's largest social networking website Facebook gives crores of rupees for video content to many celebrities
 wal street jarnal ke mutabik company live videos ke liye agle saal tak lagbhag 50 million dollar kharch kar degi
 Facebook is asking media houses and publications around the world to put more and more video content
 iske liye unhen paise bhi die ja rahe hai
 Not a youtube video, but a video upload to Direct Facebook
 video chaahe fasebuk live ke taur par ho yaa diarect aplod kiya gaya ho
 The company is continuously launching new features related to video
 abfesbuk par utyub jaise hi sabhi catagorike videos aapako mil jaaenge
 a better way category will appear on the verified pages, and it will look as if it is the video's website
 haal hi main fasebuk ne auto play video kaa feechar bhi shuru kiya he jo logon ke liye pareshaani kaa sabab he
 Videos start as soon as we scroll through the news feed
 isse company kaa sidhaa phayda hota he, kyonki jaahir he hits bhi milenge
 Although it can be turned off from the settings, but still auto play by default and many users do not understand it
 fasebuk ne virtual reality or 3D aadhaarit videos fitures pehle hi launch kar rakhaa jisase aage kaa rasta saaf he
 Now, if you pay attention to the data, you will see how video content is flourishing on Facebook
 america main fasebuk par 94 fisadi video darshak badhen he jabaki duniya bhar main 74 fisadi kii dar se bad rahe hai
 According to Facebook, people watch 1 billion videos a day here and 76 percent of Americans use Facebook to find videos
 ab jab log video dhundne ke liye fasebuk par aane lage to aap andaja laga sakate hai ki utyub kaa kya hoga
 The company's biggest motive behind doing this is obviously to earn money
 lekin iske saamne utyub he or fasebuk ko pataa he ki utyub ko achaanak kisi video feechar se maat nahin diya ja saktaa he
 So the company has been doing this work slowly for a long time, and now the effect is also visible

 So, i have decided that i will respect him and will not leave
 unhen samajhaoongaa ki kya galati hui or aage aisa na ho, iskaa prayaas karuunga
 On the question of ending Anna's agitation, he said that Anna had sent a four-page indent by hand, which was put in the trash basket by the government and made his new indent

 The question arose that the circumstances which the media showed to the people through live coverage, took advantage of the same by the bosses of terrorists sitting outside the border of the country

 During that time, avoid showing such things, which help the terrorist
 ujisi kii ore se is babat desh ke sabhi vishvavidhyalayon ko yah patr jari kiya he
 Be restrained in covering even the smallest threats, it has been emphasized so that the new generation takes these things seriously
 bharat sarkaar ke prashasnic sudhaar ayog ne apni aathvin report menmedia policyko shaamil karte hue kaha ki aatanki ghatnaon main media ko aatmasanyam ke saath reportig kerani chahie
 a statement said that in the universities or colleges affiliated to them, courses of journalism and mass communication are being conducted, the role of media in terrorist incidents must be told to the students
 lekin aisi chizon ko dikhaane se bachanaa chahie, jisase aatankwaadiyon ko sidhaa phayda pahunchataa ho
 This will help various bodies of the country to fight terrorism

 If you want to be healthy, then you must pay attention to your eating habits
 kis samay par kya khaaen or kya nahin, isse bhi bahut fark padataa he
 By eating the right thing at the right time, you will be able to stay healthy and fit
 koi bhi khaanaa timming par bahut nirbhar karata he or sharir kii physics tabhi saath detii he jab un chizon ko sahi time par liya jaae
 For example, such a thing can be healthy but it can have a negative effect on taking it at the wrong time
 jaise- kuch chijen kabhi bhi khaali pet nahin khaani chahie
 Let's know what are these things - Tomato - There is no doubt that tomato is full of vitamins and antioxidants, although when you eat it on an empty stomach, acidic nature damages the stomach
 ye pet par jarurat se zyada dawaab daalate hai or isse pet main dard ho saktaa he
 This can be a dangerous condition for people suffering from ulcers
 khattey fal-khattey fal jaise santara, angoor, neembu jaisi chijen vitamin si, fibre or antioxident se bharpoor hoti hai lekin agar aap subah khaali pet inkaa seven karte hai to aapke pet ko samasya ho sakati he
 Pastry can be a good option in puff, pastries-breakfast but not empty stomach
 inamen yeast hota he or khaali pet ko ye pareshaan karata he
 Carbonated drinks - Carbonated drinks are just as bad for health, now you think what the effect will show on an empty stomach
 subah uthte hi khaali pet carbonated drinks pine se zyada nuksaandaayak kuch auki nahin ho saktaa he
 This increases the risk of cancer and other heart diseases
 bhuulakar bhi khaali pet ise naa len
 Coffee or Tea - Are you also among those people who do not have any morning tea or coffee? aapako shaayad pataa naa chale lekin yah aadat aapke sharir ko bahut nuksaan pahunchaa rahi he
 Drinking coffee on an empty stomach increases the amount of hydrochloric acid and increases the problem of constipation and vomiting
 isse pachan kii prakriya bhi dhimi ho jaati he
 Get into the habit of drinking water on an empty stomach

 The comments ullekhneey he ki jain samudaay ke paryushan parv ko lekar meet par chaar din ke bain ke khilaaf matan kaarobaariyon ne bambe hoicourt kaa darwaja khatkhataya tha
 Last week, amid protests and outrage, the ban on meat was reduced from four days to just one day, 17 September
 hoicourt ne pichley hafte kaha tha ki mumbai ek metropolitan shahar he
 Formula cannot be such a direct restriction on the sale of meat
 packaged meet ke bare main kya he, jo pehle se hi bazaar main uplabdh he
 The ban was opposed not only by the opposition but also by the Shiv Sena, an ally of the ruling BJP
 vipakshi congress or ensipi ke alaava bijepi kii sahyogi shivasena ne aarope lagaaya ki 2017 ke sthaneey nikaay chunaavon ko dhyaan main rakhkar bijepi jain samudaay kii tushtikaran kii koshish kar rahi he
 The ban on meat began during 1994 and the Congress was in government at that time
 adhikariyon ne bataaya ki 10 saal baad do din ke bain ko badhaakar chaar din kar diya gaya tha, lekin asal main ise kabhi lagu nahin kiya gaya
 It is noteworthy that the mutton traders had approached the Bombay High Court against the Jain community's four-day ban on Paryushan festival
 pichley hafte virodh or naaraazgi ke bich meet par bain ko chaar din se ghataakar sirf ek din 17 sitambar ke liye kar diya gaya tha
 The High Court said last week that Mumbai is a metropolitan city
 maance kii bikri par is tarah kaa sidhaa pratibandh formula nahin ho saktaa
 What about packaged meat, which is already available in the market
 is bain kaa vipaksh hi nahin, sattadhari bijepi kii sahyogi shivasena ne bhi virodh kiya tha
 Apart from the opposition Congress and NCP, bjp's ally Shiv Sena alleged that the BJP is trying to appease the Jain community keeping in mind the 2017 local body elections
 paryushan ke dauraan meet par bain 1994 main shuru hua tha or us samay congress kii sarkaar thi
 Officials said that after 10 years, the two-day ban was increased to four days, but in reality it was never implemented

 uttar pradeshmen bhale hi nizaam badal gaya he, lekin auraiya janapad ke adhikariyon kii nigaah main abhi bhi sarkaar puraani hi he

 For this, China has built more than forty Buddhist monasteries and study centers near the borders of India to Satinepal and Bhutan
 or aise kendra or bhi banaae ja rahe hai
 He wants to use them to carry out anti-india propaganda campaigns
 ye khabarbhartiya khufia agenciyonne sarkaar ko di he
 The big question is whether India is ready for this attack? China has given the responsibility of protecting the study center and Buddhist monasteries to the People's Liberation Army to fulfill its objective
 jisane kai baar ladakh kii barfili seemaa main ghuspaith kii he
 The trouble of the Sashastra Seema Bal and government deployed on the Indian border has increased with this move of China
 darasal sena or biguef ghuspaith roak sakati he, goli kaa jawaab goli se de sakati he, lekin vaicharik taur par bharat ke khilaaf prachaar-prasar karne vaale in kendron or mathon se nipatna aasaan nahin lagata
 China's new strategy is considered very thoughtful
 antarrashtriya manch par bhi bharat in mathon or kendron kaa virodh nahin kar saktaa
 And if India opposes, it will also have to gather strong evidence against these centers and monasteries
 dharm ke naam par china kii ye chaal bharat ke liye nuksaandaayak sabit ho sakati he
 Two years ago, two Naxalites arrested in Delhi also revealed China's plan that China is looking for people who stay in India and adopt its ideology and use it against India
 saal 2011 main grih mantralay kii ek khufia report main bhi china kii aisi hi sajeesh kaa khulaasa hua tha
 According to the report, 7 Meitei rebel groups of Manipur formed an anti-india joint front with the Naga rebel group NSCN (K)
 jise china kaa samarthan hasil tha
 The report said that China has been in contact with anti-india groups operating in Bangladesh
 uski madad se ye gut bangladesh se myanmar chale gaye hai
 Recently, a faction of the National Democratic Front of Bodoland, which carried out slaughtering in Assam, is also running training centers in Myanmar with the help of Chinese agencies
 pratibandhit bhartiya communist party (maao) china kii madad se hi assam main apni jade majboot karne kii firaaq main he
 Naxalites, which affect about forty percent of India's population, are also getting help from China
 ab arunachal pradesh main do hazaar kilometre lambii sadak or 54 nai suraksha chaukiyon ke elaan se china pareshaan he
 He had also lodged an objection to this
 lekin bharat sarkaar ne saaf kar diya ki wo apana kaam puraa karegi
 Angry China also warned India
 or seemaa vivaad bad jane kii baat bhi kahi thi
 When his warning had no effect on India
 china ke bare ye taaja khulaasa uski 60 saal puraani bharat-virdohi dhoort ranneeti kaa hi hissaa he

 Kasab has already told the court twice that he can understand the proceedings of the court
 usne yah bhi kaha tha ki vah angreji samaj saktaa he
 But on Monday he took a different approach
 jab kasaab ko adaalat ke samaksh pesh kiya gaya to vah kaaphi sust dikhaai padaa
 He was sitting with both hands folded
 uske chehre par koi bhav nahin dikh rahaa tha
 This forced the judge to talk to him

 2ghz quadkor procesar ke saath 512MB ram diya gaya he
 Its screen 2

 Its battery is 1750mah and volte is also supported with 4G LTE
 is smartphone main fasebuk lite or kuch duusare ap bhi die gaye hai
 Its body is of polycarbonate and you can put only one SIM in it
 philhal yah saaf nahin he ki isamen whatsap chalegaa yaa nahin, kyonki puraane oparating system se dhire dhire whatsap kaa saport bhi khatm kiya ja rahaa he
 According to Lava, users will be able to easily access digital content and digital transactions through this smart feature phone
 company ne kaha he ki pehle log feechar phone ko sirf colling ke liye yuj karte the, lekin ab wo isamen internet bhi chalaa sakenge
 It is worth noting that 4G smartphones with less than this price are also present in the market
 reliance jeeyo kaa Lyf Flame 3 bhi 2,999 rupee kaa he
 In comparison with this lava phone, in many cases, Jio's phone beats it
 jaahir he log is keemat par smartphone hi khareednaa chahenge, aise main lava ke is phone ko kaisaa respons miltaa he ye to aane vaala vakt hi batayega

 The channel said in the report that the convict could file a mercy petition before the Pakistan Army Chief within 60 days of the judgment of the appellate court
 maut kii sajaa kaa saamana kar rahaa doshi senapramukh ke faisle ke 90 dinon ke bheetar raashtrapati ke samaksh dayaa kii apil kar saktaa he
 Indian Judge Justice Dalbir Bhandari, who was on the ICJ bench, said that Pakistan violated his basic human rights by not giving India the consulate access to Kulbhushan Jadhav
 ab tak jadhav ke bare main soochna naheembharat ko kulbhushan jadhav maamle main antarrashtriya nyaayalay se bhale hi raahat mil gai ho lekin unki sthiti ko lekar ashankaayen ab bhi bani hui he, kyonki pakistan ne unke swasthya yaa unke sthaan ke bare main koi soochna nahin di he
 According to government sources, the matter has reached the International Court, in such a situation, it is mandatory for Pakistan to present concrete evidence about Jadhav's whereabouts and his position
 unhone is baat par bhi jor diya ki pakistan is maamle main uchit sunwaayee kaa saboot pesh kare, jaisaa usne daawa kiya he
 Asked whether the government has any information about Jadhav's address in Pakistan, Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Gopal Bagle said that till date the Government of Pakistan has not given any information about Jadhav's condition nor has it Described where they are kept, they said that this is a matter of concern
 jadhav kii apil prakriya ke bare main puche jane par unhone kaha ki durbhaagya se bharat ko is vishay par koi soochna nahin he

 seemaa par badhaai gai chaukaseehar gaadi kii ho rahi checkingsarhad ke najdiki ilaakon main dehshatsarhad par badi sainya gatividhiyaanuchhed 370 par centre sarkaar ke faisle ke baad deshbhar main khushi kaa maahaul he, vahiin pakistan kii ore se seemaa par badhaai gai sainya gatividhiyaan, sthaneey logon ko liye dar paidaa kar rahi hai
 When the team reached till today in the village adjacent to the outskirts of RS Pura sector, there was a different view
 gramin vahaan khauf main ji rahe hai
 Cease fire is being frequently violated by Pakistan
 golibari ke bich sthaneey nivasee bahut pareshaan hai
 Some villagers said that there was firing from across the border
 jab bhi goliyaan girti hai, ham kaanpane lagate hai
 Pakistan has no faith
 poonch or rajouri sector main aksar pakistan golibari karata he
 Local citizens are facing difficulties due to continuous rain of bullets
 gaanv main aise kai ghar hai, jinke ghar kii diwaar goliyon se chalni ho gai he
 Whenever firing is done, children start screaming
 suchetagarh kii nivasee 65 saal kii sumitra golibari kaa aatank dekhakar sihar jaati hai
 Anita, a woman from the same village, said that after the removal of Article 370, the movement from Pakistan may stop
 vahiin unke ghar ke baaki sadasyon kaa kahana he ki pakistan anuchhed 370 main hue badlaav se pakistan baukhalaayaa he
 Now he can take out his anger by firing on the border
 pakistan ne ek baar phir sangharsh viraam todaa he, aise main pakistan khijhakar or bhi zyada golibari kar saktaa he
 Suchetgarh is the last village on the indo-pak border
 pakistan kii pili post gaanv se kuch hi meter kii duuri par he, jahaan se is gaanv ko aksar nishaanaa banaaya jaataa he
 The walls of the village riddled with bullets are a witness to the fact that Pakistan, submerged in the ocean of debt and terrorism, is not deterring its antics
