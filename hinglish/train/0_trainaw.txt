 suheldev bhartiya samaaj party ke ek vidhayak ne bhaajapa agent par vot faadane kaa lagaaya aarope
 The Election Commission asked the observer to test the case by watching CCTV
 yadi mat phaade gayi to faadane vaale par hogi FIR
 Let us tell you that sp's Shivpal Yadav cast the first vote for the Rajya Sabha elections in UP
 roki gai thi countincounting shuru hone dauraan UP rajyasabha chunaav main ballat paper par aapatti uthi 
 Because of this, the Election Commission gave a countering
 aarope tha ki nitin agarwal or anil singh ne apane vot othrise agent ko nahin dikhaae
 The BSP has complained to the Election Commission and that is why the counting has been stopped
 bispi or sapa ne donon vidhayakon ke vot ko radd karne kii maang kii thi
 Counting started only after the order of the Election Commission
 vahiin bataa den ki sutron ke anusaar bijepi kii sahyogi party suheldev bhartiya samaaj party ke vidhayak kailash nath sonkar ne bhi cross voting kii he
 Raja Bhaiyya's suspense was kept between Raja Bhaiya and said that i will go to vote
 haalanki vot daalane ke baad bhi unhone kisko vot diya is par kaaphi suspence rahaa
 Behind this was the conduct of Raja Bhaiya
 pehle raja bhaiya ne kaha ki main samaajawaadee party or jaya bachchan ko vot duungaa, na to bispi ko vot doongaa naa hi bijepi ko vot doongaa
 After this, Independent mlas Raja Bhaiya and Vinod Saroj cast their votes

 According to the statistics of the well-known figures, during the voting, a new strategy was made several times
 bich main baat chali ki raja bhaiya ab vot nahin daalenge
 Actually Raja Bhaiya has cast his vote for Samajwadi Party and is about to cast his vote as 37th voter
 lekin ab ek ummidavaar ko jeet ke liye 36 vot hi chahie
 In such a situation, some percentage of Raja Bhaiya's vote in 37 can go to BSP
 isiilie mana ja rahaa tha ki raja bhaiya vot nahin daalenge
 At the same time, according to sources, BJP had made a big strategy for Rajya Sabha
 voton ke ganit ke anusaar bijepi do vidhayakon kaa vot nahin dalavaaegi
 In such a situation, now 36 votes will be required for the selection of Rajya Sabha member
 matlab upi main kul 398 vot hi padenge
 Although 400 votes were cast
 do vidhayakon ke vot daalane par lagi thi rokchunaav shuru hone se pehle hi hoicourt ne duusare maamle main bhi mukhtaar ansaari ke vot daalane par roak laga di thi
 Earlier, he received permission from the lower court to cast his vote in the Rajya Sabha elections held on Friday
 saath hi mukhtaar ko kal shaam gajipur kii gangster court se bhi vot daalane kii anumati mil gai thi
 But the Allahabad High Court stayed the application of the UP government

 The biggest battle of these is about the 10th seat of UP

 The by-election for that seat will also be held simultaneously
 kaise hoti he rajyasabha chunaav main countingrajyasabha chunaav ke liye ek tay formula he, khaali siton main ek jod se vidhansabha kii kul sadsy sankhya se bhaag dena
 In conclusion also add a number that comes
 utane hi vot ek sadsy ko rajyasabha chunaav jeetne ke liye jaruri hota he
 If the example of UP is taken, then 1 in 10 seats is added, then the sum is 11
 ab 403 ko 11 se bhaag dete hai to aata he 36

 maharashtra vidhansabha chunaav ko lekar vipaksh ekajute hone kii kavayad main he, lekin sharad pavaar kii party ensipi ne maukey kii najaakat ko bhaanpate hue congress ke saamne fifty-fifty formula rakh diya he
 The NCP has made it clear that it needs seats at par with the Congress in a meeting held in Mumbai over seat sharing in the assembly elections
 aise main sawaal uthta he ki kya ensipi ke formule par congress sahamat hogi
 An NCP leader said on condition of anonymity that the situation has changed after the Lok Sabha elections
 pichley do loksabhaa chunaavon main ensipi ne congress se behatar pradarshan kiya he
 This time too, we have managed to win more seats than the Congress by fighting for fewer seats
 aise main hamen congress ke baraabar vidhansabha siten milani chahie
 Let me tell you that in the Lok Sabha elections, the Congress and NCP came together in the electoral arena
 maharashtra kii kul 42 sansadeey siton main se congress 25, ensipi 20 or anya sahyogi 3 siton par chunaav lade the
 The Congress contested 25 Lok Sabha seats, out of which only one seat was won
 jabaki ensipi ko 20 siton par ladakar 4 par jeet mili
 The two parties contested the 2014 Lok Sabha elections as well
 tab ensipi ko 4 or congress ko 2 siton par jeet mil saki thi
 Where the Congress is battered after the Lok Sabha elections, the NCP is upbeat
 aise main ensipi 2004 ke vidhansabha chunaav main seat shering kaa formula congress ko yaad dilaa rahi he
 In 2004 NCP got more seats than Congress
 haalanki congress-ensipi kaa gathbandhan 1999 main hua tha, lekin 2014 ke vidhansabha chunaav main donon ke bich seat kii sahmati nahin ban saki thi
 Due to this, both the parties contested separately and the BJP got a tremendous advantage
 bataa den ki maharashtra main isi saal ke ant main vidhansabha chunaav hone hai
 The congress-ncp, which fought jointly in the Lok Sabha elections, is once again in the process of trying its luck in the assembly elections
 maharashtra main kul 288 siten hai
 NCP also wants Raj Thackeray's party MNS to enter the coalition in Maharashtra
 iske alaava congress prakaash ambedkar kii party ko hissaa banane ke liye betaab he

 unhone kaha ki sarkaar ne 5 varshon main jiesti, aadhaar or ujjwala jaise kadam uthaae
 Earlier, Parakala Prabhakar said that the government has not been able to present any roadmap to tackle the problem

 In Chhattisgarh, preparations for the election in all the districts of Bastar are in full swing for the upcoming assembly elections, on the other hand, the workers of any political party are not going to campaign in the inner areas
 iskaa sabase bada karannaksaliyonki vah dhamkee he jisamen saaf taur par kaha gaya ki kaaryakarta agar andar aae to unhen jaan se maar diya jayega
 As a result of this, the propagation of political parties in the seven districts of the division including Bijapur Sukmadantewada and Narayanpur has been limited to the towns
 andruni ilaake main naa to kisi party ke jhande or naa hi pamplate baant rahe hai
 Although the villagers are saying that the fear of Naxalites is not in their village, yet they do not have the answer to why the members of the political party are not reaching them yet
 vahiin, duusari ore raajnneetik dalon ke kaaryakarta gramin ilaakon tak nahin pahunch paa rahe hai
 In such a situation, they also fear that they may be attacked by Naxalites
 bijapur ke andruni ilaakon main kaaryakarta jane se dar rahe hai
 The same is the situation in sensitive areas including Sukma and Dantewada
 pradesh ke van mantri or bijapur se bhaajapa ke pratyaashee mahesh gagadaa bhi sweekaarte hai ki andruni ilaakon main prachaar prasar karnaa jokhim bharaa he
 Therefore, the workers are reaching among the people at their level
 congress ke ummidavaar vikram mandavi kaa bhi maananaa he kii prachaar prasar karne main khatra to he magar janata ke bich pahunchane par hi unhen vot mil paaegaa
 So with the help of Paramilitary Forces, they are reaching those villages

 Naxalites carried out major attacks 2 times within three days
 pehle 27 oktober ko bijapur main hamalaa kiya gaya or phir dantewada main doordarshan kii team ko nishaanaa banaaya gaya
 Let us tell you that on November 12, there will be 18 seats in Chhattisgarh, these are the same seats where the influence of Naxalites
 yahi kaaran he ki in ilaakon main suraksha ko kaaphi pukhta kiya gaya he
 Despite this, the Naxalites are not getting out of their handiwork
 naksali hameshaa se hi loktantric chunaavon kaa virodh karte hai or ab yahi kaaran he ki vah logon ko vot daalane se rokane ke liye is prakaar kaa hatkandaa apana rahe hai
 Shreevats Neotiamark Zuckerberg became the 'person of the Year' in 2010, surpassing the likes of Julian Assange and Hamid Karzai in 2010
 us samay fasebuk chah saal kaa tha or jukerbarg 26 ke
 Both were small and looked good
 us vakt ham jukerbarg se saadhaaran-se sawaal poochhate the: kya soshal media vaastaviktaa ko prabhavit karata he yaa vah ise pratibimbit karata he? kya ham fasebuk ke 'aadi' ho sakate hai? kya soshal media hamen samaaj se vimukh bana degaa? aaj jukerbarg ko isse kam sahaj sawaalon kaa jawaab dene ke liye majaboor hona pad rahaa he
 Did Facebook help Donald Trump's game in the 2016 presidential election? Is our data safe with them? What measures have been taken to curb online hatred? Social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram were the precursors of a new kind of optimism in its early stages
 soch thi ki ham sabhi ek jaise smartphone par ek jaise hi aipon kaa istemaal kar rahe honge to duniya main nishchit rup se kaaphi barabari aegi
 The bonds of our religious, political and cultural differences will loosen and we will learn to live in a courageous new world where we like more things, share more things and hate less
 badakismati se ye sapane ab dhundhale pad gaye hai
 When Barack Obama accepted the Ice Bucket Challenge in 2014, we used to laugh at him, but within a few years of that, our worries have started deepening
 hamen soshal netwarking game blue hwel chalange kii phikr ho rahi he jisane bahut-se khilne waalon par aatmahatya karne tak kaa dabaav daalaa he
 In 2012, the Arab Spring convinced us that social media can be helpful in spreading democracy in the world, but by 2018 we had evidence that Facebook is sabotaging democracy
 yadi hamen kisi timeline par soshal media ke haalia itihaas kaa maanchitran karnaa ho to sabase mahatvapurn ghatana nihsandeh 2018 kaa cambridge analitica ghotaalaa hogi
 Facebook, already facing allegations of providing Russians with the ability to carry out a propaganda campaign during the 2016 presidential election, revealed it to a researcher at Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm involved in Trump's campaign
 7 karod fasebuk accountdhariyon ke vyaktigat aankade die the
 It is reported that Trump's team used Facebook data in advertisements designed to impress their key supporters, which were not investigated
 2018 main cambridge analitica ghotaale kii khabar aane ke baad fasebuk ke sheyaron kii keemat 24 fisadi se zyada gir gai or is prakriya manf company ke bazaar mulya main 134 arab dollar kii kami ai thi
 Zuckerberg had assured that Facebook's security protocol would be improved, but the actual damage had been done
 fasebuk kii bhoomika main koi badlaav nahin hua he
 We use it to get people's support and approval on our talk, to post our pictures and to stay in touch with people, but Facebook does an extraordinary job for businesses
 yah unhen hamaari praathamiktaaon or achaanak paidaa hui ichchhaaon tak pahunchane kaa rasta detaa he
 Companies can now bid to get information about our online activities
 beshak jukerbarg kaa 500 arab dollar kaa samrajya banane main vigyapandaataaon ne madad kii he, yah bhi samaj main aata he ki fasebuk kaa siio kyon apane sabase achche nawacharon ko unke liye arakshit karnaa chahega
 But for those of us apart from advertisers, it is one thing to influence the way we shop, and another to influence the way we vote
 twitor ne to ab rajnatik vigyapanon par pratibandh laga diya he, lekin jukerbarg ne jor dekar kaha he ki ''netaaon yaa samaacharon ko sensor karnaa nijee companiyon kaa kaam nahin he
 "zuckerberg, who refused to give clear information about the information broadcast from Facebook, wants him to be seen as a messenger only
" maano ve kahana chaahate hon ki ''sandeshvahak par nishaanaa saadho, mujh par nahin
 "his argument in his defense is also legitimized by the principle of free expression in democracy
" duniya jab ab jukerbarg se ek jimmedaar prakaashak kii tarah vyavhaar karne ke liye kah rahi he, to unka bachaav do tarkon par tikaa hota he
 One is that Facebook is not a publisher, it allows users to print content as they wish
 duusari or isse bhi ahm baat yah ki dosha fasebuk main nahin, ham main he
 Having given technology that enables communication and communication, we have used it to bully, cause anxiety and spread hatred
 pichley saal yah baat saamne ai ki bharat main whatsap par na keval gohatya, bal apharan or ang vyapaar kii afvaahen fail rahi thim, balki log in par pratikriyaayein karte hue sandigdh logon ko peet-peet kar maar bhi rahe the
 Ravi Shankar Prasad, while reprimanding Facebook on this, said that there is no rocket science to deal with fake news, but the operators of whatsapp had only visible solutions to this problem
 is saal aktubar main bharat sarkaar ne elaan kiya ki vah soshal media eps ke bare main niyamon ko sakht karegi kyonki unase desh ke ''loktantric rajnatik tantra ke liye'' apratyaashit adchane paidaa ho rahi hai
 The Center stated in the Supreme Court that platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, youtube, ticktalk and Instagram should be held accountable for the content shared by their users
 par yah tark phislan bhari jameen par khadaa he
 Had Facebook been forced to verify every user's post, the Meitu movement would never have spread like wildfire
 soshal media, vishesh rup se bharat main, sataae logon ke ek bade samudaay or unki sweekaaroktiyon ko vaidhata de sakaa
 The strange thing is that it also created such victims
 utpeedakon ko saamne laane kaa saahas paane ke saath hi tamaam peeditaaon ko aise tatwon se balaatkaar kii dhamkee kaa saamana karnaa padaa jinhen unhone kabhi dekha bhi na tha
 Some social media critics have blamed this situation on us users being too "addicted" to it, but these well-wishers worrying about mental health often forget that over time Twitter, Facebook and Instagram have created a different Has almost eliminated the possibility
 ab in aprihaary ho chuke plateformon ke andar se hi ghrinaa kaa pratikaar karne ke tareeke viksit hone chahie

 Last week she told on Instagram that someone upset by her reviews wrote to her, "I will pray to God that you too get gangraped like Priyanka Reddy and burnt alive
" '' ab ruudhivaadee use soshal media se hatane kii salaah de sakate hai
 But i am sure, she will tell you that this is not an option - her livelihood depends on it
 us jaisi drudh iraadon vaali kai mahilaon ko—har din twitor or fasebuk par isi tarah kii dhamkee di jaati he
 But yes, Facebook and Instagram have encouraged a new sense of entrepreneurship, and, Twitter has created a wide potential for public participation, but all three avoid accountability
 in companiyon ne nafrat or afvaah khatm karne kaa tarika na khoja to baahar rasta khojna hoga
 Zuckerberg should know that the doors of heaven and hell are side-by-side and one-to-one on social media
 yah pakkaa karnaa unka kaam he ki duusare par taala padaa rahe

 Actually, recently the social media sensation Ranu Mandal went shopping at the supermarket

 Ranu Mondal lashed on Fan to touch him
 viral video main saaf dekha ja saktaa he ki kis tarah ranu mandal fain par naaraaz ho rahi hai
 Ok, so she didn't like someone touching her
 And everyone's automatically assumed that her 'overnight' fame got to her head
 Ever stopped to reason otherwise? 1
 What is she's just having a bad day? How nice are any of us, on our bad days? 2
 So what if her fame was 'overnight'? Maybe that's what she was destined for! You clearly didn't pay a dime for it
 3
 Celebs throw tantrums all the time! Don't you still pay to go watch them play a role, for which they're paid 10 times your annual income? 4
 So what if she slept on footpaths? How does that make her any less of a human? To have bad days or just be plain moody? ▫️to the men insulting women because of your male ego
 ▫️to the women insulting other women, just because they make you feel insecure
 ▫️to those of you fighting the roadside vendors for a discount, but quietly paying twice the price at a store
 thoseto those of you who step out of religious places, only to gossip about someone who you saw there
 ▫️to those of you who'd rather feed a statue, than a hungry mouth
 thoseto those of you who cannot digest the fact that someone else is living a better life than you are
 Who gave you the right to judge her, without looking at yourselves first? 
 Media and words - when misused, can be more lethal than a weapon
 Stop assuming stuff about someone you don't even know on a personal level
 Everyone is dealing with their own shit
 Celeb or not

 Whereas, after the arrival of the Narendra Modi government at the Center, President's rule has been imposed seven times, which is in four states of the country
 haalanki aazaadee ke baad se abhi tak bharat ke alag-alag rajyon main kareeb 126 baar raashtrapati shashan lagaaya gaya he
 President's rule for the first time in Maharashtra was followed by President's rule for the first time in Maharashtra on 17 February 1980

 The Congress parted ways with other parties, including its ally NCP

 saal 2014 ke baad se desh ke chaar rajyon main raashtrapati shashan lagu kiya gaya

 The Congress reached the High Court on this matter, from where the then Harish Rawat government was relieved
 court ne raashtrapati shashan lagaae jane ke khilaaf apana nirnay diya tha
 Arunachal Pradesh was under 26 days of President's rule in 2016 only in the Arunachal Pradesh government
 congress ke 21 vidhayakon ne 11 bijepi or do nirdaleey vidhayakon ke saath haath mila liya tha
 Due to this, the state government was reduced to a minority, due to which President's rule was imposed
 haalanki, raashtrapati shashan lagaae jane ko congress ne supreme court main chunauti di gai thi or court ne apane faisle main congress sarkaar ko behaal kar diya tha
 The two-time President's rule in Jammu and Kashmir, in June 2018 in Jammu and Kashmir, the BJP withdrew support to the pdp-led government
 iske chalate mahabuuba mufti ne siem pad se istipha de diya tha, jiske baad rajya main raashtrapati shashan lagaaya gaya tha
 Article 370 was repealed in the state during President's rule and special state status has also been withdrawn from the state

 Coming off the backdrop of troubled liquor baron Vijay Mallya, the management of United Breweries (UBL) said on Wednesday that he would continue as the chairman of UBL
 haalanki is tarah kii khabaren hai ki pravartan nideshaalay ne company main maalya ke share kurk kar die hai
 Company director Chugh Yogendra Pal said after presiding over the annual general meeting here today that UBL has sought a legal opinion from the former Chief Justice of India in this regard
 paal ne kaha ki kanoon ke tahat maalya company ke chairman bane rahenge
 The comments unhone aage kaha ki abhi tak pravartan nideshaalay ne ubiel kii koi bhi sampatti or share kurk nahin kiye hai or maalya company kaa chairman bane rahane ke ayogy nahin hue hai
 The management has come forward in support of Mallya when there are reports that the ED has attached his shares in UBL
 (hedline ke alaava, is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he, yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he
 ) company ke nideshak chug yogendra paal ne aaj yahaan salanaa aamasabha kii adhyakshata karne ke baad kaha ki ubiel ne is bare main bharat ke purv mukhya nyaayadhish se kanoonee raay maangi he
 Pal said that under the law, Mallya would continue to be the chairman of the company
 tippaniyan He further stated that as of now the Enforcement Directorate has not attached any of the assets and shares of UBL and Mallya has not been disqualified to remain the Chairman of the company
 prabandhan maalya ke samarthan main tab aage aayaa he jabaki is tarah kii khabaren hai ki ubiel main unke share idi ne kurk kar die hai

 Ever since the making of 'sultan' and 'dangal' were reported, Aamir Khan and Salman Khan's films started to compare
 phir 'sultan' kii jabardast box offis safalataa ke baad se'dangal'kii safalataa ke aankadon par or bhi nazren lagi thim
 Now the 'dangal' of earnings, whether Aamir is able to throw our 'sultan' or not, it will be known soon
 lekin usase pehle jaanate hai ki film mekking main 'dangal' or 'sultan' kya alag he or ek jaisaa -kushti ke daanv-pechamir aurasalmaan khanki filmein kushti ke khel par aadhaarit hai or desh ke liye medal paane kaa jajba donon main he
 But treatment is completely different
 'sultan' jahaan ek pahalwaan ke khud ko paane kii kahani he
 At the same time, in 'dangal', a father hires daughters to fulfill their dreams
 ab jahaan tak baat pahalwani dikhaane kii he to is takanic menamir kii filmasalamaan par baari padati he
 Because of these 5 things, Aamir Khan's 'dangal', because of the fact that Aamir has wrestled only in a few scenes of the beginning of the film, but later in the way he wrestles and teaches his daughters, the technique has shown better
 yahi vajah he ki 'sultan' main anoushka sharma kii patakaniyon se zyada 'dangal' main fatima sanaa shaikh ke daanv real or romaanchak dikhte hai
 On 'dangal', Salman told Aamir - i Hate You Star Power 'sultan' had good packaging but it was dominated by Salman's star status somewhere
 ye cheez'dangal'main nahin he
 Aamir Khan is just Mahavir Singh Phogat in the film
 
 
 ek kirdaar
 This is the reason that while Salman's entry in 'sultan' and whistle is sounded on every patni, the eyes remain on the screen despite knowing the end of the film in 'dangal'
 jaane kisi he 'dangal'nirdeshak kii pakad'dangal'or 'sultan', donon hi filmon ke nirdeshkon ke khate main inase pehle koi badi hit nahin he
 In such a situation, both of them have acted confidently with Khan stars
 lekin 'sultan' ke diarector ali abbaas jafar ne film ko zyada romaanchak or ksaa hua banaaya he
 While 'dangal' director Nitesh Tiwari showed plenty of emotions and wrestling, but the thrill of making the film real reduced the thrill a bit
 kushti hi nahin dil bhi jeet gaya 'sultan'abhinay main koun aagaab ye sawaal uthanaa nahin chahie tha lekin filmon kii tulana hogi to ye point chhutegaa bhi nahin
 Salman is Salman and it was also said in the film reviews that this has been the best film of his career
 dekhen 'dangal' kii screening main koun-koun pahunchaa
 
 
 At the same time, in Aamir Khan 'dangal', Aamir Khan only appears when you see his ears
 varanaa puri film main unhone mahavir singh phogot ke kirdaar ko jaise jiya he, usase to yahi sabit hota he ki parde par bhaavon ke 'sultan' vahi hai!dangal dangal yaa sultan
 
 
 The music of 'sultan' was given by vishal-shekhar
 story ke hisaab se isamen romantic angel zyada tha

 jaise gane abhi bhi chal rahe hai
 Due to the scope of dance, these songs also played well in parties

 According to the news agency 'RIA Novosti', the ancient Olympic Games were held 1200 years ago among the warriors-players
 haalanki olympic kaa pehla aadhikarik aayojan 776 isa purv main hua tha, jabaki aakhri baar iskaa aayojan 394 isvi main hua
 It was then banned by the Emperor Theodosis of Rome, calling it a pagan festival
 iske baad lagbhag dedh sau saalon tak in khelon ko bhula diya gaya
 However, in the medieval period there were different types of competition among the elite
 lekin inhen khel aayojan kaa darja nahin mil sakaa
 Overall, in the absence of sovereign civilizations like Rome and Greece, people did not have time for sports during this period
 19veen shatabdi main europe main sarvamaanya sabhyataa ke vikaas ke saath puraatan kaal kii is parampara ko phir se jinda kiya gaya
 The credit for this goes to Pierre de Kuvertain, the nobleman of France
 kuvarten ne do lakshya rakhe, ek to khelon ko apane desh main lokapriy bananaa or doosraa, sabhi deshon ko ek shantipurna pratispardhaa ke liye ekatrit karnaa
 Kuvertain believed that sports could be the best means of avoiding wars
 kuvarten kii is pariklpana ke aadhaar par varsh 1896 main pehali baar aadhunik olympic khelon kaa aayojan greece kii rajdhani athens main hua
 In the early decade, the Olympic movement struggled to save its existence because Kuvarthen's hypothesis could not be supported by any major power
 varsh 1900 tathaa 1904 main paris tathaa saint lui main hue olympic ke do sanskaran lokapriy nahin ho sake kyonki is dauraan bhavy aayojanon kii kami rahi
 The Olympic movement came to power with its fourth edition in London
 isamen 2000 athleton ne shirkat kiya
 This number was more than the sum of the last three events
 varsh 1930 ke berlin sanskaran ke saath to maanon olympic andolan main nai jivan shakti aa gai
 The continued competition at the social and political level made the Nazis a means of proving their superiority

 After this, the game was never separated from politics

 They became an important part of politics
 chunki soviet sangh or america jaisi mahashaktiyaan kabhi nahin khule taur par ek duusare ke saath yuddh ke maidan main bhid nahin sakin

 On the 50th anniversary of the Soviet Union, the people did not want to lose to America at any cost
 isi kaa nateeja tha ki soviet athleton ne 50 swarna padakon ke saath kul 99 padak jite
 This number was one-third higher than the medals won by America
 saal 1980 main america or uske pashchim ke mitra rashtron ne 1980 ke moscow olympic main shirkat karne se inkaar kar diya

 This is the Yondr pouch that keeps the smartphone away from you
 lekin jaraa sonchie paauch aapke haath main hone ke baavjood bhi aap isse apana phone kyon baahar nahin nikaal sakate
 Actually, Yondr is a pouch made from neoprene that the company that makes the party rents to the party organizers and the rest of the event makers
 aap jaise hi kisi party main jate hai or security staff aapse aapkaa phone lekar isamen kaid kar detaa he, iske baad iske khaas tarah ke loking system kii vajah se iseap kanchi se bhi katkar kholanachahen tab bhi nahin khol sakate

 baahar jate hi is paauch ko aap aasaani se khol paaenge
 The government will launch an anti-trolling app 'you Had to Be There' for the protection of women
 Now the party is spreading this party rapidly in the surrounding cities
 or Yondr bhi insaanon ko smartphone se dur rakhane kii khaas takanic kii vajah se kaaphi popular ho rahaa he
 Even reports suggest that this pouch is being used daily in New York schools
 jisase bachche smartphone se dur rah saken
 This pouch is now going to be a part of the big party too

 He has come to India for the first time since becoming CEO

 Nadella said, "I like talking to Indian youth
 bhartiya yuva aashaa, aatmavishvaas or urja se bhare hote hai
 i get to meet many Indians abroad, who are full of confidence
 'hyderabad main janme nadela ne ejineering kii padhai manipal uniwarsity se kii thi, jiske baad vah yues chale gaye
 In the program, he also gave some tips to the youth
 unhone students se kaha, 'yadi ve jaananaa chaahate hai ki aaj bharat main kya he rahaa he, to unhen nae bijness model or aise diginon ko dekhnaa chahie, jo is desh ke liye banaae jate hai
 'nadella said,' Along with other schools, there should be engineering schools among the youth

 pakistan ke purv sainik pramukh or purv raashtrapati parvej musharraf ne bataaya ki varsh 2001 main bhartiya sansad par hue aatanki hamale ke baad paidaa hue tanaav ke vakt vah bharat ke khilaaf parmaanu hathiyaaron ke istemaal par vichaar kar rahe the, lekin javaabi karrwai ke bare main soch kar unhone apana vichaar tyaag diya
 According to media reports, 73-year-old Musharraf recalled that he also spent many nights awake during that time, during which he used to constantly think about whether nuclear weapons should be used against India
 japani dainik samachar patr 'menchi shimboone’se baat karte hue parvej musharraf ne in baton kaa khulaasa kiya he
 Musharraf said that when tensions between the two countries had escalated considerably in 2002, "there had come a time when lines made using nuclear weapons could be crossed
" ’ akhbaar ne musharraf ke hawaale se aisa kaha he
 Let us also tell you that in 2002, Pervez Musharraf publicly stated that he would not rule out the possibility of using nuclear weapons
 diu main 4 saal ke degree course ko lekar vivaad or gahraane laga he
 After du's social science, now the science department also approved the new syllabus, while students and teachers demonstrated in protest against it
 diu arts faikalti ke baahar ye log 4 saal ke degree course ke virodh main pradarshan kar rahe the to thodi hi duuri par science department main naye silebus par muhar lagaai ja rahi thi
 There is only 2 months left for admission in the new session and so far the syllabus has not been fully prepared
 iske baavjood bhi diu visi isi satr se 4 saal kaa degree program lagu karne par amada he
 This attitude of the DU administration is the main reason for the opposition of the teachers
 shanivaar ko soshal science department ne naye silebus kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 The rest of the departments can also finalize their syllabus for the new degree program this week
 nayaa course lagu hone ke baad tamaam vishyon ke silebus badal jaayenge, jiske mutabik tamaam chaatro ko 11 foundation course padhane zaruri hongen
 In 3 years, students will be able to get a pass course degree and in 4 years an honors course
 yani ab tak 3 saal main milane vaali onors course kii degree 4 saal main milegi
 The teachers allege that neither the teachers nor the students were discussed to implement the new course
 is course ko jaldbaazi main lagu kiya ja rahaa he
 From Tuesday, DU teachers have decided to oppose and intensify academic changes
 bharat kaa nayaa mantra prem or shanti nahin, balki ‘‘mek in india’’ he
 Anyway, that love is not love, in which the lover is Muslim and the lover is Hindu, then he starts to be called Jihad
 kai hindu bharat kii muslim viraasat ke prati nafrat paale rahete hai, lekin khulkar izhaar nahin kar pate, ve use pakistan kii taraf udel dete hai
 Pakistan becomes Neelkanth for poisoning this hatred
 isse lagata he, jab tak sachmuch shanti na ho, tab tak shanti kaayam nahin kii ja sakati
 If our national mission is to develop India first, then Pakistan does not matter
 vah na to bazaar he or na hi pratispardhi, na hi nivesh yaa technology kaa koi thikaana
 We are moving so fast that Pakistan is not in our eyes
 hamaare paas vishaal bhugolic ilaake kii vajah se aisi samrik takat he jise paane kaa khwab pakistani fouj dekhati rahati he
 Our population is six times more than that and our economy is eight times larger than that
 pakistan kii arthvyavastha main pichley lagbhag do dashak se mandi bani hui he, lekin paanch saal kii susti ke baad bharat kii arthvyavastha ne phir raftaar pakad lee he, isliye donon kaa antar bhi badhata ja rahaa he
 Those who tried to make Pakistan stand up against India during the Cold War era also realized that this was not possible
 aise main ham aksar poochhate hai ki yah pakistaniyon ko kyon nahin dikhataa, naak ragade jane par bhi unhen ehsaas kyon nahin hota?asaliyat to yah he ki unhen yah ehsaas he
 Our mistake is that we consider a country with a population of 200 million, while most of them are concerned about their lives
 unhen bharat se bhay ho saktaa he lekin zyaadaatar log jaanate hai ki pakistan kitna peeche he
 They are also aware of the fact that their problems are their own, not the result of any of our conspiracy
 is samay pakistan main bharat virodh ab utana vyapak nahin he jitna pakistan ke prati hamaare yahaan he
 The educated and professional sections there are keen on aligning with a strong India
 jo bhartiya is baat ko galat bataate hai, unhone vahaan ke pichley do chunaavon par gaur nahin kiya
 During that time there was neither a foreign hand nor a fan of staunch nationalism
 donon pramukh partiyon ne bharat kaa zikr keval is sandarbh main kiya ki ve uske saath shanti banaae rakhane kii disha main bharsak koshish karengi
 Political leaders of Pakistan have also obeyed his statement
 pradhanmantri navaj sharif fouj ke virodh ke baavjood bhartiya pradhanmantri kii shapath grahan main aae
 This is an example of how the difference between the military and political leaders has changed
 isse pehle 2008 main pakistani raashtrapati asif jaradaari ne bhartiya media main yah kahkar sansani failaa di thi ki ve ‘‘us din kaa khwab dekhte hai jab pakistan bharat kii takat main gunatmak vruddhi karne vaala desh ban jayega
 "no Indian leader would be able to muster the courage to say this about Pakistan or about any other country
" haalanki iske virodh main pakistan main aawaaj bhi uthi
 The Pakistani army was so enraged that it got its agents to attack our embassy in Kabul and then in Mumbai
 pakistani fouj or aam logon ke bich is antarvirodh par ham shaayad hi gaur karte hai
 We should make every effort to reject the Pakistani army's claim that India is a threat to their country
 niyantran rekha par ho rahi firing ke jawaab main hamaara apni mashinaganon va mortaron kaa munh khol dena or seemaa paar aam logon ko maut ke ghat utaar dena thik vahi he jo unki fouj hamase karana chaahati he
 This makes Pakistani generals neither stop nor weak, but on the contrary they get strength
 virodhabhasi alankaaron kii tarah ‘‘aakraamak suraksha’’ kii hamaari niti avivekpurna he
 So has our rulers of Delhi come to the understanding that terrorism emanating from Pakistan is the biggest threat to our security and there is no scope for a normal relationship with it till it stops
 afsos yah he ki pakistan ke maamle main dilli main chaahe sarkaar koi bhi ho, nasamajhi main unamem eka he
 We cannot keep ourselves isolated from Pakistan
 kushal khufia tantra se hi seemaa paar se ho rahe hamale rukenge, jaisaa ki mumbai hamale ke baad hua
 But as long as his army remains stubborn, the attack will not stop completely
 aise main, hamaare saamne vikalp kya hai?mumbai hamale ke baad fikki ne visheshgyon ke ek panel se bharat ke saamne aatankwaad se pesh hone vaale khataron kaa adhyayan karne ko kaha tha
 Some of those experts are also advisors to the current government
 unamem teen ritred police adhikari the, jinhen baari gyani-maani bataaya jaataa he
 His recommendations included all sorts of measures, from covert action to economic sanctions and targeted cross-border attacks
 aaj nai sarkaar main in sabhi upayon par phir se charchaa hone lagi he
 But there is no effective solution at all
 is gupt karrwai kaa matlab he pakistan ke saath vahi karnaa jo uske aatankwaadi hamaare saath karte hai
 This will be a big mistake
 is tarah ham pakistani fouj ke saath uski sharton par ladenge, begunaah pakistaniyon ko maarenge or loktantric sarkaar ko khastahal kar denge
 In this way we will isolate the peace seekers
 aarthik paabandiyon kaa koi matlab nahin he kyonki pakistan ke saath na to koi vyapaar he or na hi hamaara vahaan koi nivesh he
 Attacks penetrating the borders of a nuclear weapon-rich country are so risky that the US never tried to open a front in Pakistan despite attacks on its army in Afghanistan
 2002 main oparation parakram se yah sabit ho chukaa he ki koi bhi antarrashtriya sankat pakistan kii tulana main hamen kai guna zyada nuksaan pahunchaata he
 That is, these policies are not blank
 phir pakistan ke saath rishte ko sirf ek masale se jodakar dekhnaa bhi usee tarah aditol ravaiya he, jaisaa pakistan dashakon se kashmir masale ko apni tech banaae hue he
 Many people have been arguing that it is not right to stick to certain issues between two neighbors with common problems and interests
 zyaadaatar pakistani is daleel ko sweekaar kar chuke hai jabaki iske ulat hamane unki fouj kii daleel apana lee he
 Where does terrorism stand on the scale of the threats facing people in India? The data collected by the South Asia Terrorism Portal shows that in 2009 721 Indian terrorists were killed
 agle chaar saal main yah aankada 759, 429, 252 or 304 rahaa
 Pakistan can only be blamed for very few of these deaths
 2013 main 304 main se 159 log vampanthi ugravadiyon ke shikaar hue, 95 log assam, manipur, meghalaya va nagaland main maare gaye or 30 andhra pradesh, bihar or pashchim bengal main
 In Jammu and Kashmir, where Pakistani militants are mostly active, the number was only 20
 usee saal pakistani aatankwaadiyon ne 3,001 begunaah pakistaniyon kii hatya kii
 Of course Pakistan is the center of terrorism, but there is also a lot of destruction
 pakistan main lagbhag rosemara kii baat kii tarah ho rahi yah tabaahi bhartiya media main jagah nahin paati
 But the fidayeen attack across the Wagah border is probably making us realize what the common people and the government are doing there
 beshak, aatankwaad kaa rajnatik asar hota he jo saamaanya aparaadhon kaa nahin hota, lekin yah bhi sahi he ki keval shanti hi pakistan se aatankwaad ko puri tarah roak sakati he
 This will be possible only when the army is there
 fouj saath tabhi degi jab yaa to koi general satta main hoga yaa phir loktantric sarkaar itani majboot hogi ki fouj ko kaabo main rakh sake yaa fouj yah mahasoos kare ki shanti rahane se hi uske hit sadhenge
 Now that the possibility of military coup in Pakistan is less because the army does not want to bear the burden of governance of the country in this decaying state, it is in our interest that we do everything possible to strengthen the democratic leadership of the generals
 iske liye usase lagaataar samvaad banaae rakhane kii jarurat hogi
 Along with this, we can find ways to fill sweetness in Pakistani army as well
 jab general parvej musharraf ne fouj par yah dabaav daalaa ki shanti aprihaary he, to pakistaniyon ne kaha tha ki iske saboot is tathy main nihit hai ki uske afasaron ne wagha kii taraf jane vaali sadak ke donon ore khub jameen kharidi hai
 Pakistani military has large commercial and industrial interests
 jamkar anudaan paane vaale uske afasar munaafe kii kheti karte hai
 For example, we can buy cement from two of its commercial bases; You can buy wheat to fill your stock; Together with them, they can set up plants in Sindh to make electricity using Pakistan's huge lignite reserves and import electricity without increasing their carbon footprint
 kattar tatwon ko bhale na kharida ja sake lekin ham baaki pakistani phogiyon ko yakeen dilaa sakate hai ki bharat ke saath shanti unke liye phydemand he
 We also started it in the middle of the last decade
 lekin chuppi va hinsa kii hamaari maujuuda niti namasazeepurn mardaangi he jo mahaj seemaa paar shanti ke jhandabardaaron ko kam karti he or yudhonmadiyon ko khush karti he
 Of course, we cannot bypass the fanatics in the Pakistani army and have to communicate with the Parabakis
 yah mushkil hoga lekin phir kootneeti koi padhe-likhon ko paath padhaanaa to he nahin
 (satyabrata Pal was the High Commissioner of India to Pakistan from 2006 to 2009) congress ne buudhvaar ko sansad par hamale ke abhiyukt afjal guru kii sajaa kii maafee ke mudde par yah kehete hue apana pallaa jhaad liya ki is maamle par faisla raashtrapati, kendra sarkaar or dilli sarkaar ko karnaa he jiske paas saare tathy hai

 The odd-even formula is going to be implemented in Delhi from January 1, but before that it seems to be surrounded by difficulties
 dilli sarkaar ne 15 dinon ke liye shuru kiye is trial se mahilaon ko chhot di he or dopahiyaa vaahanon par ise lagu nahin kiya he
 The government has refused to keep lawyers out of this rule
 dilli hai court main ek yachika daayar karte hue sawaal uthaaya gaya he ki mahilaon or dopahiyaa vaahanon ko isse baahar kyon rakhaa gaya he?hai court ne sarkaar se maanga jawabais yachika par sunwaayee karte hue dilli hai court ne dilli sarkaar apana jawaab daakhil karne ko kaha he

 isliye 15 dinon ke trial ke dauraan ye gaadiyaan bhi sadakon par nahin utrengi
 This is in the context of a section of the media as well as the news on social media which states that the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (income Tax Appellate Tribunal) demanded tax of Rs 450 crore for the assessment year 2009-10
 The company's appeal against it is dismissed
 ITAT ne abhi tak koi faisla aplod nahin kiya he

 For this, extensive preparations have been made in the Parliament House
 inhen sabake bich congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ne kaha ki jiesti main bahut sambhaavnaaen hai lekin apana prachaar karne ke liye ise aadhe adhure swaroop main jaldbaaji main lagu kiya ja rahaa he

 bharat main aise jiesti ko laae jane kii jarurat he jo karodon nagarikon, chote vyavsaayiyon or kaarobaariyon ko itani chintaa main nahin daalen
 Earlier, Union Minister m Venkaiah Naidu appealed to the main opposition party Congress to join the historic Goods and Services Tax (GST) program
 unhone kaha ki is garimamay kaarykram kii abha ko 'aache kaarnon' se nahin bigaada janaa chahie
 Information broadcasting, Urban Development and Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation Minister Naidu claimed that the Congress was unable to accept that Narendra Modi had become the Prime Minister of the country and that is why she was opposing the program held in the Central Hall of Parliament is
 haalanki unhone congress se samaaroh ke samaaroh ke bahishkaar ke nirnay par punavarchir kaa anurodh kiya
 The comments ek channel se naidu ne kaha, congress iskaa virodh mahaj isliye kar rahi he, kyonki vah pradhanmantri narendra modi ke teen mantra riform, parform or transform ko safal hota nahin dekhnaa chaahate kyonki yah unki raajnneetik he
 According to Naidu, when all political parties in the country including the opposition are unanimous on the GST draft, their opposition only shows that he is hesitant to stand with the Prime Minister
 ullekhneey he ki desh kaa sabase bada kar sudhaar, guds and services tex, yani jiesti yaa vastu evam seva kar, shuukravaar kii madhyaraatri (yani shanivaar, 1 july, 2017) ko sansad ke aitihaasik central haul main raashtrapati dow pranab mukherjee kii upasthiti main pradhanmantri narendra modi dwaara launch kiya jayega
 This will be the fourth time since independence when a ceremony will be held in the Central Hall at midnight
 pichley teenon kaarykram desh kii azaadi se jude hai, or yah bhi ek kaaran he ki congress ne shuukravaar raat ke kaarykram ke bahishkaar kaa elaan kiya he
 Several other opposition parties are also staying away from the program
 mana ja rahaa he ki kai apratyaksh karon kaa sthaan lene ja rahe jiesti se 20 kharab america dollar kii hamaari arthvyavastha puri tarah badal jaaegi
 (also from the input language) isse purv kendriya mantri em venkaiya naidu ne mukhya vipakshi dal congress se aitihaasik maal evam seva kar (jiesti) se jude kaarykram main shaamil hone kii apil kii he
 He said that the aura of this dignified program should not be spoiled for 'good reasons'
 soochna prasaaran, shahari vikaas or awaas tathaa shahari garibi unmoolan mantri naidu ne daawa kiya ki congress is baat ko sweekaar nahin kar paa rahi he ki narendra modi desh ke pradhanmantri ban gaye hai or isiilie vah sansad ke kendriya kaksh main yojit kaarykram kaa virodh kar rahi he
 He however requested the Congress to reconsider the decision to boycott the ceremony
 tippaniyan Naidu told a channel, Congress is opposing it simply because it does not want to see Prime Minister Narendra Modi's three mantras Reform, Performance and Transform succeed because it is his political

 The people gave the responsibility of running the government by giving mandate to Mahayuti but Shiv Sena has disrespected the mandate
 lihaaja ham rajyapal ko jaankaree dene ke liye aae hai ki ham sarkaar nahin banaaenge
 He said that the governor had sent us an invitation to form the government but due to lack of majority, we will not form the government
 aapaki jaankaree ke liye bataa den ki maharashtra vidhansabha chunaavon main bijepi ko 105 siton par jeet mili thi vahiin shivasena 56 siten jitkar duusare number kii party bani thi
 In Maharashtra, the bjp-shiv Sena alliance had got a clear majority but due to some reasons the differences between the two parties came to light, due to which the matter of formation of the state government was stuck in the balance
 rajyapal kii taraf se sabase bade dal ko sarkaar banane kaa nyotaa diya gaya tha, jiske jawaab main bijepi ne sarkaar banane par apni asamarthta jataa di he
 Therefore, the Governor will invite the second largest party to form the government

 The way in which development has taken place inside India, it is necessary to remove article 370 for development in Kashmir: Amit Shah- i believe that terrorism cannot be eradicated from Kashmir as long as there are articles 370 and 35A
 
 kashmir ko aatankwaad se mukt karne ke liye artical 370 or 35A hataanaa nihaayat jaruri he : amit shah- jo log kashmir ke yuvaaon ko uksaate hai unke bete-betiyaan landan, america main padhai karte hai
 They are not worried because they have done everything well

 '- jammu or kashmir ke vikaas main baadhak bhi artical 370 he

 Has done a lot of damage to people
 sharnaarthiyon ko aaj tak naagarikta nahin mili
 '- Muslims, Hindus, Sikhs, Jains all live in the valley
 dhara 370 acchhee he to sabake liye acchhee he or buree he to sabake liye buree he

 jab gaurav se poocha gaya ki kya unhone isliye kuch nahin kaha kyonki bani priyanka ke saath khadi thim, kya vah vahi karenge jo bani karengi? iske jawaab main unhone kaha ki priyanka ne unke saamne apni baat rakhane kii koshish kii thi or vah kah rahi thim ki vah biimaar hai, isliye unhone kuch nahin kaha
 The comments iske baad ke sawaalon ke jawaab main bani ne kaha ki vah khud ko vinar maanati hai or unhen lagata he ki top 5 main unke or gaurav ke alaava rohan, manu-manavir yaa lopamudra ho sakate hai
 Bani also said that if her and Gaurav's nomination is canceled, she wants to nominate Manu and Manveer so that Manu, Manveer and Mona i
e
 M3 can be nominated together
 vahiin gaurav ne nitibha or manu ko nominete kiya
 After the task was completed, 'bigg Boss' told Bani and Gaurav that the members of the house were asking them questions
 ghar ke zyaadaatar sadsy gaurav or bani ke jawaab se santusht nahin hue is vajah se is task main gharavaale fail ho gaye or ve lagjri bajet se ek baar phir vanchit ho gaye
 At the same time, when Gaurav expressed his desire to nominate Nitibha, Nitibha showed him the shoe
 baad main manavir or nitibha ke bich is baat ko lekar bahes ho gai
 Manveer said that he should not have done this, to which Nitibha said that if this is the case then he should not abuse
 is par donon ke bich bahes ho gai
 Manveer later told Manu that he is playing in Nitibha's favorite but she is fighting him
 is par manu ne kaha ki vah game khel rahi he or jab task aayega to vah uske bare main nahin sochengi
 Late in the night, Manveer was seen cleaning the kitchen in anger and there was an argument between the two

 vahiin, jab gaurav ne nitibha ko nominete karne kii ichha bataai to nitibha ne unhen juuta dikhaaya
 Later, a debate took place between Manveer and Nitibha
 manavir ne kaha ki unhen aisa nahin karnaa chahie tha, is par nitibha ne kaha ki agar aisa he to unhen bhi gaali nahin deni chahie
 There was a debate between the two
 manavir ne baad main manu se kaha ki vah nitibha ke fevar main khel rahe hai lekin vah unase hi lard rahi hai
 To this, Manu said that she is playing the game and she will not think about it when the task comes
 der raat manavir gusse main kichan saaf karte dikhe or vahaan bhi donon ke bich bahes hui
 In Greater Noida in Uttar Pradesh's Gautam Buddha Nagar district, a family has fallen victim to some domineering hooliganism
 yahaan ke icotech-3 thana kshetra main rahane vaali ek mahila ko chhedhkhani kaa virodh karnaa mahangaa padaa
 The bullies barged into his own house and beat him mercilessly
 isi dauraan dabangon ne mahila ke parivaaravaalon ko bhi nahin choda
 He also scrambled with them

 vahiin peedit parivaar ne apane saath hui marpet kii shikaayat police se kar di
 The police have registered a case and started searching for the accused

 beijing olympic khelon main thode se antar se padak chukne kii tis ke kaaran pichley chaar saalon se baichaiyn rahe pahalwaan yogeshwar dutt kaa kahana he ki landan olympic main padak jeetne ke baad vah ab aaraam kii neend so sakate hai
 Yogeshwar, 29, a resident of village Bhainswal Kalan in Sonipat, Haryana, said that he missed the nights in four years after missing the medal in the Beijing Olympics, but now he will be able to sleep peacefully after winning the Olympic medal
 tippaniyan Yogeshwar said, "for the last four years, i used to dream of winning the Olympic medal every day and i thank God that this time he has justice with me and i can sleep comfortably now

 It was the year of 2003
 raipur main ek paan vaale se puch rahaa tha ki sarkaar kiski banegi
 He kept quiet
 jab log chale gaye to paan vaale ne kaha ki ham kuch nahin kahenge
 Don't know which government man is standing here and later i get in trouble
 usee dauraan ek varisht afasar mujhase milane aae
 On coming to the hotel room, he told that he did not come from the front but from the back of the hotel
 mujhe bahut hairaani hui
 Said that the government does not know when it is known
 aise kai kisse sunne ko mili the
 It is not necessary to be true, but it was seated among the people that the government is following them like a shadow
 pehali baar chunaav cover karne kaa mauka mila tha
 The passion to roam in Chhattisgarh was also ridden
 ajit jogi kii sarkaar kaa kaam uski banaai sadakon par dikhataa tha
 Then Chhattisgarh had many times better roads than our state Bihar
 un sadakon ko dekhakar lagata tha ki jogi nahin haarenge, lekin jab log baat karte-karte chup ho jate the to yakeen ho jaataa tha ki jogi haarenge
 Even in the common people, this image was created that nothing is printed against Jogi in the media of Chhattisgarh
 unhone ek tivi channel bhi khol liya tha, jo unke chunaav haarate hi gaayab ho gaya
 Often, many people take the name of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the matter of playing on the media and social media, but all this has been part of the Congress culture
 logon ko pataa tha ki akhbaar main sirf sarkaar kii tarif chhapati he
 Jogi had also closed some channels
 saare survey jogi sarkaar kii badhat dikhaa rahe the
 i was just saying that Jogi will lose
 mujhe yaad he tabake mere sampadak ne kaha tha ki kaise kehete ho haar jaaenge
 Jogi has been winning the survey
 main yahi kahata tha ki agar kisi sarkaar kii dharna yah ban jaae ki wo har baat sun rahi he, saaye kii tarah peechha kar rahi he or uski ninda koi khuleam nahin kar saktaa, use log haraa dete hai
 At that time, many big leaders of BJP also used to ask me that we are really winning
 thik aisa hi maine haryana main chautaala sarkaar ke samay hote dekha he
 The media there had become Chautala 
 logon ko khulkar bolne main bhay lagata tha ki chautaala ke log sun lenge
 Now whether there was a direct role of the government in creating fear or not, there can be a dispute, but many times in a section of society, there is a perception that the media is not free
 koi kuch bol nahin rahaa he
 Someone is following them
 koi phone sun rahaa he
 If someone is turning over tax files, then people start to fear that government
 jab aadmi sarkaar se darane lage to phir us sarkaar ke paas kuch bachaa nahin rah jaataa
 Leaders in power often enjoy the feeling that my power is intact
 tab haryana main chautaala sarkaar ke kisi kareebi samarthak ne poocha bhi tha ki kya lagata he
 i had said on this basis that Chautala would be defeated
 mazaaq main kah diya ki aapane galati kii
 They also used to publish news against their newspapers
 zaahir he der ho chuki thi
 i understand that there is no single reason for someone's defeat or victory
 kai kaaran hote hai or kai prakaar kii sthitiyaan banati hai
 But one of the reasons for all those reasons is how the perception about the government is
 is baar dilli main ek tabake main is bhay kaa zikr khub suna
 Especially after Kiran Bedi's interview
 kai log mujhe hi kai baar phone karne lage
 Some of these were also pro-government people
 sab salaah dene lage ki sanbhal kar chalanaa chahie
 a shopkeeper said that you are not afraid
 ye sarkaar kuch bhi kar sakati he
 i used to be very surprised
 main hi kahata rahata tha ki aisa kuch nahin he
 The government is always criticized
 media main bhi hoti he
 But people were not ready to accept
 unka kahana tha ki dekhiye media main sirf sarkaar kii tarif hi hoti rahati he
 There is no mention of other things in the newspapers
 ek saadhaaran mahila kii baat bhul nahin paa rahaa hum ki ham ek kii hi baat kyon sune
 How to know that he is fine duusare kii sunenge tabhi to milakar dekhenge ki koun thik he
 When i talk to many leaders, their tone suddenly changes
 jaise hi unhen dhyaan aata he ki koi sun legaa wo idhar-udhi dekhne lagate hai
 When talking to journalists, it is more heard that not on the phone
 milakar baat karenge
 a gentleman came to see me
 mujhe hairaani hui ki wo yah baat phone par nahin kah sakate the isliye milane aae
 All these are not good signs for any government
 dhire-dhire ye sari baaten alag-alag staron par public hone lagati hai
 The government should be in power
 sarkaar kaa dar kaayam nahin hona chahie
 i cannot tell the number but this number was so much that any government should worry
 aisi dharna ban gai thi
 The hourly coverage on TV had raised doubts in the minds of people that what is the matter that only praise is being received
 wo apane aas-paas ke halaat bhi dekh rahe the jinamein us str kaa badlaav to hua hi nahin tha jis str kii tarif ho rahi thi
 Delhi is a city equipped with TV and newspaper
 yahaan akhbaar dhyaan se padhe jate hai
 Many say the public became impatient
 aisa nahin he
 The ratio in which the media was praising the government did not seem to change
 hua yah ki apane aap bina kuch kiye ek kism kaa avishvaas ban gaya
 People want strong leadership so that they take tough decisions and take everyone along
 lekin kahin se yah sandesh gaya ki majboot netritv ke naam par logon ko bhi daraaya ja rahaa he
 This contributed to the aggression of those who had started threatening the anti-tone by taking the name of the Prime Minister throughout the day
 pradhanmantri to ek taraf samvaad bana rahe the magar duusari taraf unke naam par bolne vaale kuch or hi sandesh de rahe the
 At the same time, news related to manipulation also reinforced these fears that it is difficult to speak against the government
 loktantr main janata sarkaar ke kilaaf bolne ko hameshaa dushman kii tarah nahin leti he
 She feels relieved to say this
 use lagata he ki koi sarkaar ko sidhe raste par rakh rahaa he
 This is because she loves that government
 janata us sarkaar ko chunane vaali hoti he to chaahati he ki koi us par nigaah rakhe
 Someone should criticize him and the government should also come forward and answer
 jabatak yah dotarafa samvaad nahin hota he logon kaa sarkaar main bharosa kamazor hota chalaa jaataa he
 Nowadays, many governments have started adopting a one-sided mode of communication
 isse soochnaao ke avishwasaneey hone kaa khatra bana rahata he
 Social media has become a weapon to suppress the tone of criticism
 yahaan chup karaane ke kai tareeke garh liye gaye hai
 If you ask a question, then many people will ask that you asked a question about them
 yah santulan or tulana nahin he balki jawaab dene ke bajaae dhamkaana he ki sawaal poocha kaise
 Common people do not get confidence from this
 abhi bhi aam log aise hai jo vot sabhi ko dete hai magar unase duuri banaae rakhte hue nazar bhi rakhte hai
 There is no longer a single party included in this new political culture
 zyaadaatar partiyaan aisa karne lagi hai
 There is such an army of supporters that there is no question that the fumigation starts
 patrakaron yaa vaise logon ko gaaliyaan di jaati hai, jo sawaal karte hai
 Those who believe in democracy will have to think deeply about these things
 aalochana or yahaan tak ki ekatarfa aalochana kii jagah bhi uplabdh karaane kaa jimmaa sarkaar kaa he
 The more open an assessment is about a government, the better
 sarkaar ke paas samvaad or samaadhaan karne kaa mauka hota he
 Delhi's mandate will and should be read in a variety of ways
 abhi to narendra modi ke vijay kaa hi sahi tareeke se vishleshan hona baaki he, arvind kejariwal ke karishme kaa bhi chapter jud gaya he
 But whatever analysis is done, keep a chapter on what the public was thinking about the government while losing and winning
 aakhir kyon log kah rahe the ki koi awaz uthaane vaala hona chahie
 Did people get scared of the government? centre kii samprag sarkaar par dabaav badhaate hue tamilnadu vidhansabha ne maang kii he ki bharat pruthak tamil ilam ko lekar sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad main prastaav pesh kare or srilanka ko mitra raashtra bulaanaa band kare
 The Assembly on Wednesday unanimously passed a resolution in this regard
 isamen centre se aagrah kiya gaya he ki srilanka main tamilon kaa ‘daman’ rukne tathaa ‘narsanhaar or yuddh aparaadh’ ke liye jimmedaar logon ke antarrashtriya jaanch kaa saamana karne tak colombo par aarthik pratibandh lagaaya jaae

 The women's bag may or may not have a makeup kit, but a lipstick is definitely there
 ek lipstick mahilaon kii khubsuurati par chaar chand lagane kaa kaam karti he
 If it is not applied properly on the lips, it can also eclipse your beauty
 aaie jaanate hai ki lipstick lagane kaa sahi tarika kya he
 1
 lipstick lagane se pehle ye jaanch len ki aapke hont ruukhe yaa fate na hon varanaa daraaron ke bich skin color aapaki khubsuurati bigaad degaa
 In such a situation, apply lip balm or glycerin on dry lips first, only then use lipstick
 2
 Before applying lipstick, make a dark outline with lip pencil
 isse honton kaa aakaar ubharkar aayega or phir aapaki lipstick zyada aakarshak dikhegi3
 If you apply only one coat of lipstick, it will lighten quickly
 lipstick ke kam se kam do-teen kot to jarur lagaaein
 Secondly, it is also important to use lipstick after taking into consideration the color of your skill
 4
 After applying a coat of lipstick, apply a little powder on the lips with the fingers, doing this will set the lipstick completely
 iske baad agar aapako lag rahaa ho ki lipstick halki lag gai he, to ek kot or laga sakati hai
 The liquor businessman Vijay Mallya, who took a loan of thousands of crores of banks from the country, tried to surround PM Modi by making several tweets on Thursday
 piem modi buudhvaar ko 16veen loksabhaa ke apane antim bhaashan main bina maalya kaa naam liye bainkon kaa 9000 karod rupee lekar 'bhaag jane vaale' ek shaks kii charchaa kii thi
 In response, Mallya said that he is ready to return the money, but why did PM Modi not ask banks to take it
 apane ek twit main bhagode kaarobaari maalya ne kaha, 'main sammaan ke saath yah poochna chahta hum ki pradhanmantri apane bainkon ko yah nirdesh kyon nahin dete ki main kingfisher ko milane vaale public fund ko chukaane ke liye main jo paisa dene ko taiyaar hum, wo use len
 'following on from my earlier tweet, i respectfully ask why the Prime Minister is not instructing his banks to take the money i have put on the table so he can at least claim credit for full recovery of public funds lent to Kingfisher
 — Vijay Mallya (@thevijaymallya)february 14, 2019vijay maalya ne ek or twit main kaha ki piem modi achche vaktaa hai or media ne jis tarah kii kahaniyaan gadhi hai, usase main yah maan letaa hum ki vah mere bare main hi baat kar rahe the
 Mallya said, 'the Prime Minister's last speech in Parliament has got my attention
 vah nishchit rup se achche vaktaa hai
 i noticed that he was referring to a person without name, who has 'absconded' with Rs 9000 crore
 media kii kahaniyon ko dekhte hue main yah maan saktaa hum ki vah mere bare main hi baat kar rahe the
 'the Prime Ministers last speech in Parliament was brought to my attention
 He certainly is a very eloquent speaker
 i noticed that he referred to an unnamed person who ran away with 9000 crores
 Given the media narrative i can only infer that reference is to me
 - Vijay Mallya (@thevijaymallya) February 14, 2019 Mallya said that he had also offered to settle the issue in the Karnataka High Court
 maalya ne kaha, 'ise tuchh prastaav bataakar khaarij nahin kiya ja saktaa
 It is a completely genuine, serious, honest and fulfilling offering
 ab gend duusare paale main he
 Why don't banks take back the loan given to Kingfisher Airlines? 'I have made the offer to settle before the hon’ble High Court Court of Karnataka
 This cannot be dismissed as frivolous
 It is a perfectly tangible, sincere, honest and readily achievable offer
 The shoe is on the other foot now
 Why don’t the Banks take the money lent to KFA ?— Vijay Mallya (@thevijaymallya)february 14, 2019maalya ne ek baar phir apana bachaav karte hue kaha ki usne to court ke samaksh apni kareeb 14,000 karod rupee kii sampatti rakh di he
 In another tweet, Mallya said, "I am amazed at the media reports about the Enforcement Directorate's claims that i have hidden my property
" yah janata ko gumraah karne kaa sharmnaak vakya he, haalanki yah bahut achraj kii baat nahin he
 If there was a hidden asset, how could i openly present assets worth about Rs 14,000 crore before the court? Am appalled to say the least at the media reports on the Enforcement Directorate claims that i hid my wealth! If there was hidden wealth how could i put approximately 14,000 crores worth of assets openly in front of court? Shameful misleading of public opinion but unsurprising

 In his first interview after becoming the Chief Minister of Delhi, Kejriwal attacked Lt Governor Najeeb Jung and called him a 'polling agent' of the BJP and alleged that the Lt Governor had changed his government house to 'BJP headquarters' 
 tippaniyan Criticizing Najib Jung, Kejriwal said that he does not give an appointment or even pick up his phone to Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia or other ministers of Delhi

 BJP President Amit Shah, UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan properly outlined the Dalit background so that their being a Dalit is not left behind due to vast experience of Governor, Rajya Sabha and Advocacy
 somvaar ko bijepi sansadeey samiti kii baithak main faisla hua ki bihar ke rajyapal ramnath kovind raashtrapati pad ke liye endie ke ummidavaar honge
 Ramnath Kovind was born on 1 October 1945 in Paranok, a village in Kanpur
 unhone kanpur vishvavidhyalay se commers or elelbi kii padhai kii
 He has experience of practicing in Delhi High Court and Supreme Court for sixteen years
 teen baar upiessi kii koshish kii magar iees main nahin hua to aapane elaed services chhod vakaalat kaa rasta apana liya
 Became private secretary to the then Prime Minister Morarji Desai in 1977, during which he came in contact with the BJP leadership
 1990 main bijepi ke tikat par ghatmpur loksabhaa se chunaav bhi lade magar haar gaye
 Was elected to the Rajya Sabha from UP in 1994 and was a member of the House until 2006
 2007 main kanpur dehaat kii bhoginipuri vidhansabha se chunaav lade magar basapa ke ummidavaar se haar gaye
 Before being made the Governor of Bihar in August 2015, he was the General Secretary of the UP BJP
 akhil bhartiya coli samaaj ke adhyaksh rah chuke hai or bijepi dalit morcha ke bhi adhyaksh rahe hai
 There are only two big master strokes in India's politics
 mahila, muslim, dalit or pichhadaa
 Scheduled tribe cards rarely run
 ho saktaa he up raashtrapati pad ke liye bachaa kar rakhaa gaya ho
 Like 2017, a similar master stroke was carried out by the Congress in 1997 when KR Narayanan's name was announced as the presidential candidate
 bijepi se lekar sanyukt morcha tak ne unki ummidavaari kaa samarthan kiya tha
 Will the Congress now give a return gift to the BJP? wo ek aitihaasik ghadi thi, pehali baar koi dalit bharat ke ganatantr ke shikhar par baithne ja rahaa tha
 No major party campaigned against Narayanan, except the Shiv Sena which made TN Seshan its candidate
 us vakt ke aar narayanan ko raashtrapati ke liye padane vaale kul 11,04,546 voton main se 9,56,290 vot mili the
 This was a record
 ke aar narayanan ne nyaaypalika ke saamne aise sawaal uthaa diye jise lekar ab tak chuppi thi or raashtrapati shashan kii siforeeshon par tatkaaleen pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi se takaraa gaye
 You can read a report by Prabhu Chawla in India Today on 25 July 1999 on the Internet
 november 1998 main raashtrapati narayanan ne jajon kii niyukti kii file par on record tippanee kar di thi ki anusuchit jati or janajati ke yogya ummidavaar hote hue bhi nyaaypalika main unka pratinidhitiv kyon nahin he
 There was a lot of debate then
 aath saal baad yani 2006 main ke ji baalkrishnan bharat ke pehle dalit mukhya nyaayadhish banate hai
 Gopal Gandhi, whose candidature was short-lived this year, was Secretary to President KR Narayanan
 unhone raashtrapati kii taraf se colegium kii file par likhaa tha ki jaj tabadale se lekar apane tamaam nirnyon ke bare main aapatti yaa sahmati likhit rup main darj karen
 In October 1998, the Atal Bihari Vajpayee cabinet recommended imposition of President's rule in Bihar, Narayanan returned after 80 hours of consideration saying that the government should reconsider as he does not think there is a constitutional crisis in Bihar
 ab is kadam kii tulana aap uttarakhand or arunachal pradesh main raashtrapati shashan kii sifarish par maujuuda raashtrapati pranab mukherjee ke dastakhat se kar lijie
 Both decisions were rejected by the courts, but the High Court of Uttarakhand even remarked that the President is no king that his decision will not be reviewed
 pranab mukherjee ke naam kaa elaan hote vakt bhi kaha gaya tha ki ve raajnneetik or sanvaidhanik maamalon ke anbhavi hai
 Thankfully, Pratibha Patil is not remembered among them, she was also the master stroke as the first female President
 narayanan ko congress duusari baar bhi ummidavaar bananaa chaahati thi magar sarkaar bijepi kii thi or uske paas ab ek nayaa master stroke tha e pi je abdul kalam
 Dalit had a Muslim symbol in front of him
 kai log kehete hai ki gujarat dangon ke dauraan sena ke hastkshep kii pahal karne ke kaaran nayaa pratik laayaa gaya
 Riddif
com has published an interview of KR Narayanan on 8 March 2005 which he gave to the Malayalam monthly magazine Human Culture
 isamen unhone kaha he ki gujarat ke sampradayik dangon main sarkaar or prashasan kaa samarthan tha
 i wrote a lot of letters to Prime Minister Vajpayee in this matter but he did nothing
 ke aar narayanan dalit raashtrapati the magar ve pratik raashtrapati nahin the
 Would it be correct to restrict Ramnath Kovind to just symbols and master strokes
 jabaki bihar ke rajyapal ke rup main ve khud ko sabit kar chuke hai
 Chief Minister Nitish Kumar is applauding him
 unhone rajbhavan ko dilli kii tarah raajnneeti kaa adda nahin banane diya
 Ramnath Kovind was sworn in as Governor on 8 August 2015 before the Bihar elections and was present at the rally in Ara on 18 August where the Prime Minister had promised to give 1
25 lakh crore to Bihar
 yah kaarykram sarkari tha magar rajyapal kaa parichay thodaa chunavi ho gaya tha
 The BJP is again using these synonyms
 bihar main isse chunavi laabh to nahin hua magar is bahaane bihar ko ek acha rajyapal mila
 Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan has said that Kovind is a Dalit and anyone who opposes him will be anti-dalit
 is tark se to kisi ko paswan ji ke khilaaf chunaav hi nahin ladanaa chahie yaa bispi ke khilaaf kisi ko ummidavaar hi nahin utaarna chahie
 What is Ram Vilas Paswan doing in the camp where Shiv Sena is the one who opposed the candidature of India's first Dalit President and nominated TN Seshan
 tippaniyan It is true that there is a new kind of anxiety among the existing Dalits
 oona kii ghatana kaa virodh ho yaa rohit vemula kii khudakushi ke baad kaa raajnneetik hangaamaa
 After the incident in Saharanpur, Bhim Army came to Jantar Mantar twice
 kahin jignesh hai to kahin chandrashekhar hai, kahin ratan laal hai to kahin chandrabhan prasad hai
 Even after this, BJP did not reveal any Dalit face in UP elections, yet it won a historic victory
 ramnath kovind kii prishthbhumi se zyada pradhanmantri kii raajnneetik daanv kii charchaa honi chahie
 Whether he scattered the opposition with this name
 kai logon ko laalkrishna adwani ke liye sahanubhuti ho rahi he
 Now why should anyone speak for Advani ji, he can also speak himself
 har baar to nahin magar kai baar raajnneeti main sahanubhuti ke liye bolnaa padataa he or pad ke liye chup rahanaa padataa he
 For the time, welcome Kovind ji
 aapako solah saal tak dilli hoicourt or supreme court main practice karne kaa anubhav hasil he
 Tried UPSC thrice but not in IAS, you left Allied Services and took up the path of advocacy
 1977 main tatkaaleen pradhanmantri morarji desai ke privet secetry bane, usee dauraan bhaajapa netritv ke sampark main aae
 He also contested from Ghatampur Lok Sabha on a BJP ticket in 1990 but lost
 1994 main upi se rajyasabha ke liye chune gaye or 2006 tak sadan ke sadsy rahe
 In 2007, he contested from Bhoginipuri assembly in Kanpur countryside but lost to BSP candidate
 agast 2015 main bihar ke rajyapal banaae jane se pehle ve upi bijepi ke mahaamantri the
 He has been the President of All India Koli Samaj and also President of BJP Dalit Morcha
 bharat kii raajnneeti main do chaar hi bade master stroke hai
 Women, Muslims, Dalits and Backward
 anusuchit janajati kaa card kam hi chalata he
 May have been retained for the post of Vice President
 2017 kii tarah 1997 main ek aisa hi master stroke congress ne chalaa tha jab ke aar narayanan kaa naam raashtrapati pad ke ummidavaar ke taur par ghoshit hua tha
 His candidature was supported by the BJP to the United Front
 kya congress ab bijepi ko ritern gift degi
 It was a historic watch, for the first time a Dalit was going to sit on the peak of the Republic of India
 narayanan ke khilaaf kisi bhi bade dal ne campan nahin kiya, shivasena ko chhod kar jisane tii en sheshan ko apana ummidavaar banaaya tha
 r Narayanan of that time received 9,56,290 votes out of a total of 11,04,546 votes for the President
 ye tabaka record tha
 KR Narayanan raised such questions in front of the judiciary about which there was still silence and clashed with the then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee on the recommendations of President's rule
 25 july 1999 ke india today main prabhu chawla kii ek report aap internet par pard sakate hai
 In November 1998, President Narayanan commented on record on the file of the appointment of judges, why he is not represented in the judiciary despite being a qualified candidate of scheduled castes and tribes
 tab khub bahes hui thi
 Eight years later, in 2006, KG Balakrishnan became the first Dalit Chief Justice of India
 gopal gandhi jinaki ummidavaari kii baat thodi der ke liye is saal chali thi, ve raashtrapati ke aar narayanan ke sachiv the
 He wrote on behalf of the President on the collegium file that the judge should file an objection or consent in writing about all the decisions from the transfer
 oktober 1998 main atal bihari vaajapeyi cabinet ne bihar main raashtrapati shashan lagane kii sifarish kar di, narayanan ne 80 ghante tak vichaar karne ke baad yah kahkar lautaa diya ki sarkaar dobaaraa vichaar kare kyonki unhen nahin lagata ki bihar main koi sanvaidhanik sankat he
 Now compare this step with the signature of the current President Pranab Mukherjee on the recommendation of President's rule in Uttarakhand and Arunachal Pradesh
 donon hi faisle adaalaton se khaarij ho gayi balki uttarakhand kii hoicourt ne yahaan tak tippanee kar di ki raashtrapati koi raja nahin hota ki uske faisle kii samiksha nahin hogi
 While announcing Pranab Mukherjee's name, it was also said that he is experienced in political and constitutional matters
 shukr he in sabake bich pratibha patil yaad hi nahin aatin, wo bhi pehali mahila raashtrapati ke rup main master stroke thim
 The Congress wanted to make Narayanan a second time candidate, but the government was with the BJP and now had a new master stroke, APJ Abdul Kalam
 dalit ke saamne muslim pratik tha
 Many people say that the new symbol was brought in due to the initiative of the army to intervene during the Gujarat riots
 ridiff daat com ne 8 march 2005 kaa ke aar narayanan kaa ek intervyuu prakashit kiya he jo unhone malayalam kii masik patrika maanav samskruti ko diya tha
 In it, he said that the government and administration had support in the communal riots of Gujarat
 maine is maamle main pradhanmantri vaajapeyi ko bahut saare patr likhe magar unhone kuch nahin kiya
 KR Narayanan was a Dalit President but he was not a symbol President
 kya ramnath kovind ko sirf pratikon or master stroke tak simit karnaa sahi hoga
 Whereas he has proved himself as the Governor of Bihar
 mukhyamantri nitish kumaar unki saraahna kar rahe hai
 He did not allow Raj Bhavan to become the hub of politics like Delhi
 ramnath kovind ne bihar chunaav se pehle 8 agast 2015 ko rajyapal ke rup main shapath lee or 18 agast ko aara kii us raily main haazir the jahaan pradhanmantri ne bihar ko sava lakh karod dene kii baat kahi thi
 The event was official, but the introduction of the governor had become a bit electoral
 bijepi phir se inhen paryaayavachi visheshnon kaa istamaal kar rahi he
 It did not bring electoral gains in Bihar, but Bihar got a good governor on this excuse
 kendriya mantri ramvilas paswan ne kaha he ki kovind dalit hai or inkaa jo virodh karegaa wo dalit virdohi hoga
 With this logic, one should not contest elections against Paswan ji or one should field candidates against BSP
 ramvilas paswan us kheme main kya kar rahe hai jahaan shivasena he jisane bharat ke pehle dalit raashtrapati kii ummidavaari kaa virodh kiya tha or tii en sheshan ko ummidavaar banaaya tha
 The comments yah sahi he ki maujuuda daliton ke bich nai tarah kii bechaini dikh rahi he
 Oppose Una incident or the political uproar after Rohit Vemula's suicide
 saharanpur kii ghatana ke baad bhim army kaa jantar mantar par do-do baar chal kar aana
 Somewhere there is Jignesh, somewhere there is Chandrashekhar, somewhere is Ratan Lal and somewhere there is Chandrabhan Prasad

 There are only two big master strokes in India's politics
 mahila, muslim, dalit or pichhadaa
 Scheduled tribe cards rarely run
 ho saktaa he up raashtrapati pad ke liye bachaa kar rakhaa gaya ho
 Like 2017, a similar master stroke was carried out by the Congress in 1997 when KR Narayanan's name was announced as the presidential candidate
 bijepi se lekar sanyukt morcha tak ne unki ummidavaari kaa samarthan kiya tha
 Will the Congress now give a return gift to the BJP? wo ek aitihaasik ghadi thi, pehali baar koi dalit bharat ke ganatantr ke shikhar par baithne ja rahaa tha
 No major party campaigned against Narayanan, except the Shiv Sena which made TN Seshan its candidate
 us vakt ke aar narayanan ko raashtrapati ke liye padane vaale kul 11,04,546 voton main se 9,56,290 vot mili the
 This was a record
 ke aar narayanan ne nyaaypalika ke saamne aise sawaal uthaa diye jise lekar ab tak chuppi thi or raashtrapati shashan kii siforeeshon par tatkaaleen pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi se takaraa gaye
 You can read a report by Prabhu Chawla in India Today on 25 July 1999 on the Internet
 november 1998 main raashtrapati narayanan ne jajon kii niyukti kii file par on record tippanee kar di thi ki anusuchit jati or janajati ke yogya ummidavaar hote hue bhi nyaaypalika main unka pratinidhitiv kyon nahin he
 There was a lot of debate then
 aath saal baad yani 2006 main ke ji baalkrishnan bharat ke pehle dalit mukhya nyaayadhish banate hai
 Gopal Gandhi, whose candidature was short-lived this year, was Secretary to President KR Narayanan
 unhone raashtrapati kii taraf se colegium kii file par likhaa tha ki jaj tabadale se lekar apane tamaam nirnyon ke bare main aapatti yaa sahmati likhit rup main darj karen
 In October 1998, the Atal Bihari Vajpayee cabinet recommended imposition of President's rule in Bihar, Narayanan returned after 80 hours of consideration saying that the government should reconsider as he does not think there is a constitutional crisis in Bihar
 ab is kadam kii tulana aap uttarakhand or arunachal pradesh main raashtrapati shashan kii sifarish par maujuuda raashtrapati pranab mukherjee ke dastakhat se kar lijie
 Both decisions were rejected by the courts, but the High Court of Uttarakhand even remarked that the President is no king that his decision will not be reviewed
 pranab mukherjee ke naam kaa elaan hote vakt bhi kaha gaya tha ki ve raajnneetik or sanvaidhanik maamalon ke anbhavi hai
 Thankfully, Pratibha Patil is not remembered among them, she was also the master stroke as the first female President
 narayanan ko congress duusari baar bhi ummidavaar bananaa chaahati thi magar sarkaar bijepi kii thi or uske paas ab ek nayaa master stroke tha e pi je abdul kalam
 Dalit had a Muslim symbol in front of him
 kai log kehete hai ki gujarat dangon ke dauraan sena ke hastkshep kii pahal karne ke kaaran nayaa pratik laayaa gaya
 Riddif
com has published an interview of KR Narayanan on 8 March 2005 which he gave to the Malayalam monthly magazine Human Culture
 isamen unhone kaha he ki gujarat ke sampradayik dangon main sarkaar or prashasan kaa samarthan tha
 i wrote a lot of letters to Prime Minister Vajpayee in this matter but he did nothing
 ke aar narayanan dalit raashtrapati the magar ve pratik raashtrapati nahin the
 Would it be correct to restrict Ramnath Kovind to just symbols and master strokes
 jabaki bihar ke rajyapal ke rup main ve khud ko sabit kar chuke hai
 Chief Minister Nitish Kumar is applauding him
 unhone rajbhavan ko dilli kii tarah raajnneeti kaa adda nahin banane diya
 Ramnath Kovind was sworn in as Governor on 8 August 2015 before the Bihar elections and was present at the rally in Ara on 18 August where the Prime Minister had promised to give 1
25 lakh crore to Bihar
 yah kaarykram sarkari tha magar rajyapal kaa parichay thodaa chunavi ho gaya tha
 The BJP is again using these synonyms
 bihar main isse chunavi laabh to nahin hua magar is bahaane bihar ko ek acha rajyapal mila
 Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan has said that Kovind is a Dalit and anyone who opposes him will be anti-dalit
 is tark se to kisi ko paswan ji ke khilaaf chunaav hi nahin ladanaa chahie yaa bispi ke khilaaf kisi ko ummidavaar hi nahin utaarna chahie
 What is Ram Vilas Paswan doing in the camp where Shiv Sena is the one who opposed the candidature of India's first Dalit President and nominated TN Seshan
 tippaniyan It is true that there is a new kind of anxiety among the existing Dalits
 oona kii ghatana kaa virodh ho yaa rohit vemula kii khudakushi ke baad kaa raajnneetik hangaamaa
 After the incident in Saharanpur, Bhim Army came to Jantar Mantar twice
 kahin jignesh hai to kahin chandrashekhar hai, kahin ratan laal hai to kahin chandrabhan prasad hai
 Even after this, BJP did not reveal any Dalit face in UP elections, yet it won a historic victory
 ramnath kovind kii prishthbhumi se zyada pradhanmantri kii raajnneetik daanv kii charchaa honi chahie
 Whether he scattered the opposition with this name
 kai logon ko laalkrishna adwani ke liye sahanubhuti ho rahi he
 Now why should anyone speak for Advani ji, he can also speak himself
 har baar to nahin magar kai baar raajnneeti main sahanubhuti ke liye bolnaa padataa he or pad ke liye chup rahanaa padataa he
 For the time, welcome Kovind ji
 narayanan ke khilaaf kisi bhi bade dal ne campan nahin kiya, shivasena ko chhod kar jisane tii en sheshan ko apana ummidavaar banaaya tha
 r Narayanan of that time received 9,56,290 votes out of a total of 11,04,546 votes for the President
 ye tabaka record tha
 KR Narayanan raised such questions in front of the judiciary about which there was still silence and clashed with the then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee on the recommendations of President's rule
 25 july 1999 ke india today main prabhu chawla kii ek report aap internet par pard sakate hai
 In November 1998, President Narayanan commented on record on the file of the appointment of judges, why he is not represented in the judiciary despite being a qualified candidate of scheduled castes and tribes
 tab khub bahes hui thi
 Eight years later, in 2006, KG Balakrishnan became the first Dalit Chief Justice of India
 gopal gandhi jinaki ummidavaari kii baat thodi der ke liye is saal chali thi, ve raashtrapati ke aar narayanan ke sachiv the
 He wrote on behalf of the President on the collegium file that the judge should file an objection or consent in writing about all the decisions from the transfer
 oktober 1998 main atal bihari vaajapeyi cabinet ne bihar main raashtrapati shashan lagane kii sifarish kar di, narayanan ne 80 ghante tak vichaar karne ke baad yah kahkar lautaa diya ki sarkaar dobaaraa vichaar kare kyonki unhen nahin lagata ki bihar main koi sanvaidhanik sankat he
 Now compare this step with the signature of the current President Pranab Mukherjee on the recommendation of President's rule in Uttarakhand and Arunachal Pradesh
 donon hi faisle adaalaton se khaarij ho gayi balki uttarakhand kii hoicourt ne yahaan tak tippanee kar di ki raashtrapati koi raja nahin hota ki uske faisle kii samiksha nahin hogi
 While announcing Pranab Mukherjee's name, it was also said that he is experienced in political and constitutional matters
 shukr he in sabake bich pratibha patil yaad hi nahin aatin, wo bhi pehali mahila raashtrapati ke rup main master stroke thim
 The Congress wanted to make Narayanan a second time candidate, but the government was with the BJP and now had a new master stroke, APJ Abdul Kalam
 dalit ke saamne muslim pratik tha
 Many people say that the new symbol was brought in due to the initiative of the army to intervene during the Gujarat riots
 ridiff daat com ne 8 march 2005 kaa ke aar narayanan kaa ek intervyuu prakashit kiya he jo unhone malayalam kii masik patrika maanav samskruti ko diya tha
 In it, he said that the government and administration had support in the communal riots of Gujarat
 maine is maamle main pradhanmantri vaajapeyi ko bahut saare patr likhe magar unhone kuch nahin kiya
 KR Narayanan was a Dalit President but he was not a symbol President
 kya ramnath kovind ko sirf pratikon or master stroke tak simit karnaa sahi hoga
 Whereas he has proved himself as the Governor of Bihar
 mukhyamantri nitish kumaar unki saraahna kar rahe hai
 He did not allow Raj Bhavan to become the hub of politics like Delhi
 ramnath kovind ne bihar chunaav se pehle 8 agast 2015 ko rajyapal ke rup main shapath lee or 18 agast ko aara kii us raily main haazir the jahaan pradhanmantri ne bihar ko sava lakh karod dene kii baat kahi thi
 The event was official, but the introduction of the governor had become a bit electoral
 bijepi phir se inhen paryaayavachi visheshnon kaa istamaal kar rahi he
 It did not bring electoral gains in Bihar, but Bihar got a good governor on this excuse
 kendriya mantri ramvilas paswan ne kaha he ki kovind dalit hai or inkaa jo virodh karegaa wo dalit virdohi hoga
 With this logic, one should not contest elections against Paswan ji or one should field candidates against BSP
 ramvilas paswan us kheme main kya kar rahe hai jahaan shivasena he jisane bharat ke pehle dalit raashtrapati kii ummidavaari kaa virodh kiya tha or tii en sheshan ko ummidavaar banaaya tha
 The comments yah sahi he ki maujuuda daliton ke bich nai tarah kii bechaini dikh rahi he
 Oppose Una incident or the political uproar after Rohit Vemula's suicide
 saharanpur kii ghatana ke baad bhim army kaa jantar mantar par do-do baar chal kar aana
 Somewhere there is Jignesh, somewhere there is Chandrashekhar, somewhere is Ratan Lal and somewhere there is Chandrabhan Prasad
 iske baad bhi bijepi ne kisi dalit chehre ko upi chunaav main saamne nahin kiya phir bhi aitihaasik jeet mili
 The political stakes of the Prime Minister should be discussed more than the background of Ramnath Kovind

 maharashtra main siyaasi halchal tedhjit pavaar ko manaane main juty ncpsubaha se ajit ke saath hai kai netamaharashtra main siyaasi ghatnakram lagaataar badalata ja rahaa he
 Efforts are constantly being made to convince Ajit Pawar to leave the NCP and go with the Bharatiya Janata Party
 somvaar ko NCP netaa chagan bhujabal samet kai netaa ajit pavaar se mulaakaat karne pahunche or unhen manaane kii koshish kii
 But NCP leaders failed to convince Ajit Pawar
 ek lambii mulaakaat ke baad jab chagan bhujabal baahar nikle to ajit pavaar bhi vidhansabha se sidhe apane ghar ke liye ravaanaa hue
 When NCP leaders reached to convince Ajit Pawar on Monday morning, he was repeatedly asked to come back
 sutron kii maane, ensipi netaaon kii ore se ajit pavaar ko kaha gaya ki agar floor test hota he to unki haar hogi
 But NCP wants Ajit Pawar to come back so that there is no impact on the Pawar family
 bataa den ki ajit pavaar ko aaj hi upmukhyamantri pad kaa padbhaar sanbhaalane ke liye mantralay janaa tha, lekin vah nahin ja paae hai
 On the other hand, Devendra Fadnavis has taken over as Chief Minister
 ajit pavaar se milane ke baad kya bole bhujabal?ajit pavaar se milane ke baad chagan bhujabal ne kaha ki hamane vichaar vimarsh kiya he, kuch rasta nikle iske liye koshish jari he
 We are working to find some way out in a positive way
 jab chagan bhujabal se poocha gaya ki kya ajit pavaar ko party se baahar nikaala jayega to unhone kaha ki is baat ko vah sharad pavaar tak pahunchaayenge
 However, Jayant Patil said that he would meet Ajit Pawar once again
 Chief Minister's Office, Maharashtra: CM Devendra Fadnavis’ first signature of this tenure was done on a CM Relief Fund cheque, on reaching Mantralaya, which was handed over to Kusum Vengurlekar by the Chief Minister

 But from this launch event till now, the most talked about iphone x is happening worldwide
 ek report ke mutabik log event main iphone x kii tulana main duusare products ke launch ke dauraan log kam utsahit the
 There are many reasons for the iphone x to be in the news
 pehali to ye ki yah company kaa best smartphone he
 Second because it is the most expensive iphone
 teesraa isliye kyonki america sinetter ne isse jude privesi par sawaal uthaae hai
 But more than all of this, it is important for India that why the price of iphone x is so high
 bharat main iphone x ke 64GB vairient kii keemat89,000 rupee hogi, jabaki 256GB vairientyaha 1 lakh 2 hajaar rupee main milegaa
 Talking about America, the price of 64GB iphone x there is $ 999
 ab aap agar dollar ko bhartiya rupee main tabdeel karen to yah 64,145 rupee hote hai
 That is, its price in India is about 39 percent more than the US
 pichley saal jab iphone 7 Plus launch hua tha tab america main isaki shuruaati keemat 769 dollar thi
 If it is converted into rupees then it is 51,000 rupees
 yah jab bharat main launch hua tab isaki shuruaati keemat 72,000 rupee thi
 Then you had to pay 21,000 rupees more than in America
 is baar iphone x ke liye bhartiya yugers ko america ke mukaable 24,855 yani lagbhag 25 hajaar rupee zyada dene honge
 Although taxes are not linked to US prices, Indian prices are announced after adding taxes
 america chhodkar kuch duusare deshon main bhijifhone x kii keemat bharat kii tulana main kam hai
 For example, the 256GB variant of the iphone x in Hong Kong is priced at 9888 Hong Kong dollars
 yani ise rupee main tabdeel karen to yah lagbhag 81,000 rupee hota he
 In India, the price of this variant will be 1 lakh 2 thousand rupees, i
e
 more than 20 thousand from there
 yani aap itane paise main hong cong ja sakate hai or vahiin se iphonex kharid sakate hai

 Political infighting is growing over the Supreme Court's decision on the Rafale fighter jet deal with France
 congress ne sarkaar kii taraf se adaalat ke nirnay main tathyaatmak sudhaar karne vaali yachika kaa zikr karte hue kaha he ki sarvocch nyaayalay ko apana nirnay waapas lenaa chahie or jhuthe saboot rakhane ke liye sarkaar ko nyaayalay kii avmaananaa kaa notice jari karnaa chahie
 Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Anand Sharma said that the decision of the Supreme Court on Rafael is a matter of discussion
 hamane pehle bhi yah kaha tha ki is maamle main jaanch sirf sanyukt sansadeey samiti (jepisi) hi kar sakati he
 He said that the government misled the Supreme Court on the basis of which the decision came
 sarkaar ne pehle bataaya ki price kii detel kaig ko di ja chuki he or CAG ne uski jaanch kar use lok lekha samiti ko de diya
 The PAC has also submitted its edited report to Parliament
 na to PAC kii report ai, na hi wo PAC ke paas gai
 He said that the government has said its curative petition that Adalat did not understand the words in his Judgment and instead of 'is', 'has been'
 sharma ne kaha ki sarkaar ne supreme court se maafee maangane kii bajaay jajon kii angreji or vyakaran sambandhi jaankaree par sawaal uthaaya he
 Therefore, the Supreme Court should withdraw its order and the government should also give notice of contempt of court for having false facts
 anand sharma ne kaha ki samvidhan ke hisaab se desh kii sabase badi sanstha bharat kii sansad he
 The government has also defied Parliament by referring to CAG and PAC, whose action will be taken in Parliament
 yah bhi padhein: rafel: PAC ke pech main fansi modi sarkaar, supreme court se galati sudhaarney kii guhaarunhone kaha ki yadi pradhanmantri me galat nahin kiya to sanyukt sansadeey samiti (JPC) ke saamne kyon nahin aate? is maamle main dephence secretary, dephence ministar, vayusena pramukh samet sabhi pakshon ko bulaane kaa adhikaar sirf JPC ko he
 This is what has been happening for the last two days to run away from the investigation and mislead the court and take a wrong decision
 bijepi ne kaha he ki wo 70 press conference karenge
 He should go to Kumbh and apologize
 agar wo 700 press conference karen tab bhi jhooth par pardaa nahin daalaa ja saktaa
 Significantly, the Supreme Court, while giving great relief to the Modi government at the Center, had rejected all the public interest litigations related to the investigation under the court's supervision of the Rafale aircraft deal
 lekin court ke aadesh ke para number 25 ko lekar vivaad khadaa ho gaya jisamen kaha gaya tha ki rafel kii prising detail CAG ko di gai he, jisaki report CAG ne PAC ko di or uskaa ek sampadit hissaa sansad ke samaj or public domen main he

 - Input from IANS bollywood main ek badi safalataa kai naakaamiyon ko dho daalati he
 Kangana Ranaut gave dozens of weak and big flop films, but the success of 'queen' made her as if he was elevated
 aisa lagane laga or kaha jane laga ki kangana apane dam par film ko hit kara sakati hai
 There is no star bigger than Kangana, no better actress than Kangana
 tabhi main soch rahaa tha ki jis kahani or nirdeshak ko is safalataa kaa shrey milanaa chahie vah sara shrey kangana ko mil rahaa he or aakhirkaar vah pal aa hi gaya jab sari baaten or kangana kii tarifen dhari kii dhari rah gayi jab film relies hui 'revolver rani' or 'ungali'
 Both of these films had Kangana but the film did not ask for water at the box office
 yani revolver rani or ungali kaa ek bhi sho cinemagharon main thik se nahin chalaa or tabhi dekhne ko mila kangana kaa staradam
 She was followed by another film by Kangana, 'tanu Weds Manu Returns'
 yah hit film 'tanu vaids manu' kaa sikval thi
 The film was also a big hit and people started giving all the credit to Kangana again
 tab bhi mere man main khyaal aayaa kii tanu vaids manu ke nirdeshak anand el raay is credit ke asal hakdaar hai jo chote shaharon kii kahani ko is tarah halake phulke andaaz main pesh karte hai ki aam darshak usase judaa hua paata he
 The film is a hit
 anand el raay bina kangana ke sonam kapur ke saath bhi super hit film bana chuke hai jiskaa naam tha 'ranjhna'
 But all credit to Tanu Weds Manu Returns was given to Kangana
 tippaniyan Although i do not rule out Kangana's good or best acting, Queen Ho or Tanu Weds Manu Returns
 kangana ne in filmon main laajawab abhinay kiya he, magar in filmon kii safalataa kaa sara shrey kangana ko nahin de saktaa
 i remember when the first trailer of the film 'katti Batti' was released, Kangana was being asked questions like "you don't need a hero, you make the film a hit without a hero?" '
 
 Et cetera et cetera
 magar katti batti kii release ke baad kangana or media donon ko jawaab mil gaya ki kangana bheed nahin juta sakati, box offis par
 Kangana is successful only when the story is different and strong
 in donon filmon main kangana thim magar film ne box offis par pani nahin maanga
 That is, not a single show of Revolver Rani and Finger did not run properly in theaters and then Kangana's stardom was seen
 uske baad kangana kii ek or film ai 'tanu vaids manu riterns'
 It was a sequel to the hit film 'tanu Weds Manu'
 yah film bhi bahut badi hit hui or log phir sari credit kangana ko hi dene lage
 Even then, i thought that Anand l Rai, director of Tanu Weds Manu, deserves the credit for presenting the story of small towns in such a light way that the general audience gets connected to it
 film hit hoti he
 Anand l Rai has also made a super hit film with Sonam Kapoor without Bina Kangna, which was named 'ranjhana'
 magar tanu vaids manu riterns kii sari credit kangana ko de di gai
 The comments haalanki main queen ho yaa tanu vaids manu riterns, inase kangana ke achche yaa behtareen abhinay se inkaar nahin karata
 Kangna has acted brilliantly in these films, but cannot give all the credit for the success of these films to Kangana
 mujhe yaad he jab film 'katti batti' kaa pehla trailor jari kiya gaya tha tab kangana se sawaal puche ja rahe the kuch is tarah "aapako kisi hero kii jarurat hi nahin, aap to bina hero ke hi film ko hit kara detii hai?''
 
 vagairah vagairah
 But after the release of Katti Batti, both Kangana and the media got the answer that Kangana could not gather crowds at the box office
 kangana tabhi safal hai jab kahani kuch alag ho or damdaar ho
 She was followed by another film by Kangana, 'tanu Weds Manu Returns'
 yah hit film 'tanu vaids manu' kaa sikval thi
 The film was also a big hit and people started giving all the credit to Kangana again

 uttar pradesh kii encounter police ko kya tanaav hone laga he? is tanaav ko dur karne ke liye use dharmaguruon kaa sahaara lenaa pad rahaa he
 The entire police staff in Faizabad listened to the discourse of a religious teacher to relieve tension
 uttar pradesh ke faijabad main police adhikariyon or karmchaariyon kaa jamaavada laga tha
 There was a program of preaching by a religious teacher
 dharmaguru bhi ekadam modern
 The name is Swami Dharmabandhu who lives in Orissa
 lekin inaki karmbhumi he gujarat
 In Rajkot, Gujarat, he has established the Vedic Mission Trust, Swami Dharmabandhu, who came from there, was giving them knowledge of dealing with criminals, reducing mental stress and boosting morale
 swami dharmaguru ne apane pravachan main kaha ki jis kaam ko karne se agar khushi milegi to us vyakti ko kabhi stress nahin hoga
 But if you are unhappy with work and do it with unhappy mind, then there will be no treatment
 darasal kya sach main upi kii encounter police itane tanaav main he ki use dharmaguru ke upadesh die ja rahe hai? agar aisa he bhi to phir gujarat ke hi swami kyon? or phir itane bade kaarykram kii ijaajat kisne di? kahin yogi raaj main upi police kaa bhi bhagavakaran to nahin ho rahaa he?faijabad ke esaspi manoj kumaar khulkar nahin kah rahe ki aadesh kiski taraf se tha
 But it is not difficult to understand that such programs cannot be done without the above orders or information, where the police duty of the district leaves and sits to listen to the discourse
