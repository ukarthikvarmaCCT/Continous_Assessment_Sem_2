 How can India remain silent when there is turmoil in Pakistan? bharat kii is puure cese main dilchaspee ho sakati he kyonki navaj sharif or bharat ke bich rishte naram-garam rahe hai
 In fact, when Narendra Modi was swearing in as Prime Minister four years ago, Nawaz Sharif was among the special guests

 The sari-shawl diplomacy of PM Narendra Modi and Nawaz Sharif felt that the positive effect of mutual warmth would also be seen on the relations between India and Pakistan, but this warmth of regret remained here

 beshak, kargil yuddh ke vakt navaj sharif pakistan ke piem the, lekin mana jaataa he ki ye jang unke dimag kii upaj nahin thi
 Later, former President Pervez Musharraf said that Nawaz Sharif had ordered the Pakistan Army to retreat
 jaahir he jo kuch hua wo paak fouj ne karaayaa or pakistan kaa itihaas gavaah he ki vahaan fouj kii hi chalati he
 Sharif started politics in the eighties under the military ruler zia-ul-haq
 vakt ke saath unki siyaasi style main badlaav aata gaya
 He soon recognized the strength of the army, so whenever he got a chance, he made a move to improve relations with India but then withdrew under the pressure of the army

 First time from November 1990 to July 1993

 Ram Madhav then tweeted a 45-second video of Rahul's speech in which Rahul is referring to nri's contribution to India's development
 unhone likhaa ki ye buddhi kaa ek or namoona he ki gandhi-nehru enarai the or congress enarai kaa andolan tha

 isse pehle, pradhanmantri narendra modi ko ek khat main anna hajaare ne likhaa tha, "hamen apane sipaahiyon or kisaanon kaa dhyaan rakhana hoga

 Their demand is that the government should rejoin the farmers' consent clause at the time of land acquisition, because the danger to the farmers is very high due to its absence

 Apart from this issue, the government has also faced criticism from the opposition and activists for the changes in the Land Acquisition Bill, which are calling the government's changes as 'anti-farmer'

 During the election, Trump said he would make America great again
 ab kah rahe hai ki bhuto na bhavishyati tip mahaan bana denge
 Supporters shout slogans that will make America great, Trump says
 bana denge
 The history of the Great and Greater Country has been a history of war
 us takat ko hasil karne kaa itihaas rahaa he jise likhane ke liye dukaane hi nahin kholani hoti hai, topein bhi chalaani hoti hai
 At this time, leaders in many countries in the world are claiming to make their country great
 apni saansen tham lijie, aap mahanata ke nae daur main pravesh kar rahe hai
 Keep an eye on the white pages where new history is to be written
 basharte kuch nayaa itihaas ban paaya to
 If written trumpagaman ko lekar ek taraf samarthakon kii bheed utsahit he
 Reaching Washington
 trump us america ke nayak hai jo mahanagaron main nahin rahata he
 The trump is being called the descriptive candidate
 hamaare yahaan jame jamaaye khel ko bigaad dene vaala, bhandol kar dene vaala diserptive kehalaata he
 People try to understand but are unable to understand
 lekin trump ke matadaata josh se bhare hai
 Millions of people are gathering in the National Mall in front of the US Parliament
 trump samarthak mukhauta lagaakar aaye hai jis par likhaa he, america ko phir se mahaan bana do
 New dawn is about to start in America for them
 unke swaagat samaaroh kaa bahishkaar bhi ho rahaa he
 About 50 Congress members have announced not to attend the ceremony
 1973 main bhi richard nicksan ke shapath grahan samaaroh kaa 80 saansadon ne bahishkaar kiya tha
 Protests have taken place in front of the Trump International Hotel and Tower in New York
 robert di nero jaise bade kalakaaron ne hissaa liya he
 Robert De Niro said that whatever happens, we patriots, Americans, New Yorkers stand together for the citizens of our country
 nari virdohi bayaan ke khilaaf mahilaon ne bhi trump ke shapathgrahan samaaroh ke bahishkaar kaa elaan kiya he
 According to reports, close to 200,000 forty thousand people will march against Trumpman in Washington
 iske alaava duniya ke alag alag shaharon main 600 march nikaale jane kaa daawa kiya ja rahaa he
 In 2009, Obama's inauguration saw 1
8 million people
 dekhte hai ki trumpagaman ke liye kitne log aate hai
 Trump's supporters are saying that they chose because they are talking about making America great
 bibisi se baat karte hue ek trump samarthak ne kaha he ki use bhi bura laga tha jab 2009 main obama ne shapath lee thi isliye trump ko lekar dukhi logon kaa dard samaj saktaa hum
 The American public is divided into two parts

 Someone has quipped that Trump's supporters may not like Lincoln's legacy when he sees Trump in front of the statue of Abraham Lincoln, the sixteenth president of the United States, who abolished slavery
 kya trump unki viraasat ko aage badhaayenge
 Trump has mocked the black American African people
 ashanka zaahir kii ja rahi he ki trump ke kaal main unke adhikaron par hamale honge
 It is in this context that Trump's speech at the Lincoln Memorial is viewed
 lekin trump hote kahin or hai, bolte kuch or he
 So far, his style suggests that he will talk about keeping America united in his speech, but people will also hear that the same trump has said that the people of Mexico will not allow them to enter America
 america main musalamaanon ke aane par asthaayee rup se roak laga denge
 Will take out more than 10 million migrants
 phir bhi unke bhaashan par puri duniya kii nazar he
 In the first few hours after taking oath, they also look at what Obama's decisions are reversed
 trump tamaam aalochanaon se prabhavit nahin dikhte hai
 They are repeating in their words that this is a movement, such a movement would not have happened anywhere in the world
 aapmen se aadhe log hat pahane hue hai, america ko phir se mahaan banaayenge
 These things suggest that Trump will redefine America
 in baton kaa yahi matlab he ki duniya ke alag alag mulkon se aae logon se jo america basaa he, ab america unka he jo iske mul bascindia hai
 Those who wear hats
 samarthakon ko lagata he ki trump america main naukariyaan waapas laaenge
 The whole game is about jobs
 janata duniya bhar main apni sarkaron se naukariyon kii ummid lagaae baithi he
 One day, from her home to the neighborhood, she will also know the reality of the dreams shown by her about jobs
 tamaam aankade bataate hai ki aarthik asamanta bad rahi he
 Hundred and fifty rich people own half of the world's wealth
 zaahir he baaki ke paas kuch nahin he yaa bahut kam he
 So far, the health of these hundred and fifty people in the world has not been affected

 naukariyaan badhane ke tamaam daavon ko ginate rahiye
 Here also in America
 tippaniyan Trump is the first in 240 years of democratic history who has not served in any military service or held any public office
 70 saal kii umr main raashtrapati ban rahe hai
 Trump is the first to start his first term at this age
 trump kab kya bolenge or kya kar denge kisi ko andaaza nahin he
 Trump's statement is that as a country we should be unpredictable
 yani kab kya karenge kisi ko pataa na ho
 The whole world is watching them regarding foreign policy
 iraan ke saath america ne jo parmaanu samjhauta kiya tha kya use badal denge
 Trump says it would never have resulted in a bad deal
 kya unke bayanon kii tarah faisle bhi hone ja rahe hai
 What would happen if Trump started turning his statements into verdicts
 is tarah ke kayaas lag rahe hai
 Sometimes we say that we have to live with the deal with Iran
 climet change yani jalwaayu parivartan ko lekar unke bayanon ko lekar zyada chintaa zaahir kii ja rahi he
 Trump has said he will cancel the Paris Agreement
 ek taraf china apni nitiyon kii samiksha kar rahaa he
 Many coal-fired power houses are shutting down
 trump kehete hai ki jalwaayu parivartan kii baat bakawaas he
 But the same trump says that the stock of nuclear weapons should be reduced
 kya yah acchhee baat nahin he
 Talking about fighting ISIS, we say that we should waste oil itself
 nato ke bare main bhi unka bayaan badalata hi rahaa he
 The overall challenge is to see Trump in the context of his statements or wait for policies
 bayanon se ve kai baar palatate hai
 They are establishing their new courtesy
 kuch bhi bolo or jab man kare phir nayaa bol do
 The crowd of supporters is excited about Trumpgaman
 washington pahunch rahi he
 Trump is the American hero who does not live in metros
 trump ko diserptive candidet kaha ja rahaa he
 The game that is frozen in our place is called perishable, deceptive disorder
 log samajhane kaa prayaas karte hai magar samaj nahin paa rahe hai
 But Trump's voters are full of enthusiasm
 america sansad ke saamne ke neshnal mal main lakhon kii sankhya main jamaa ho rahe hai
 Trump supporters have come with a mask on which is written, Make America Great Again
 unke liye america main nai subah kaa aagaaz hone vaala he

 Let's see how many people come for Trumpgaman
 trump ke samarthak kah rahe hai ki unhone isliye chunaa kyonki ye america ko mahaan banane kii baat kar rahe hai
 Speaking to the BBC, a Trump supporter has said that he too felt bad when Obama was sworn in in 2009 so i can understand the pain of the unhappy people about Trump
 america janata do hisson main bant gai he
 28,000 security forces have been deployed for the ceremony
 khabaron ke mutabik is aayojan par 200 million dollars kaa kharchaa aayega
 About 1400 crores in Indian rupees
 hamaare hi netaa achche hai
 They do not spend so much on the oath taking ceremony
 america ke solahaven raashtrapati, das pratha ko khatm karne vaale abraham linkan kii pratimaa ke saamne trump ko dekhakar kisi ne chutki lee he ki ho saktaa he ki trump ke samarthak linkan kii viraasat ko pasand na karte hon
 Will Trump take his legacy forward? trump ne ashwet yani africa america logon kaa mazaaq udaaya he
 It is feared that their rights will be attacked during Trump's time
 isi sandarbh main linkan memorial par trump ke bhaashan ko dekha ja rahaa he
 But there are trumps elsewhere, speaking is something else
 ab tak unki style bataati he ki ve bhaashan main america ko ekajute rakhane kii baat to kar denge lekin logon ko yah bhi sunai degaa ki isi trump ne kaha he ki mexico ke logon ko america main ghusane nahin denge
 We will temporarily ban Muslims from entering America
 ek karod se adhik migrant ko baahar nikaal denge
 Nevertheless, his speech has an eye on the whole world
 shapath lene ke baad pehle chand ghanton main ve obama ke kin faislon ko palatate hai us par bhi nazar he
 Trump is not impressed with all the criticism
 apni baton main baar baar doharaa rahe hai ki yah ek andolan he, duniya main is tarah kaa andolan kahin nahin hua hoga
 Half of you wearing hats will make America great again
 in baton se lagata he ki trump america ko nae sire se paribhaashit karenge
 These things mean that America, which is settled by people from different countries of the world, now belongs to those who are its original residents
 jo hat pahante hai
 Proponents think Trump will bring jobs back to America
 sara khel naukariyon kaa he
 The public is expecting jobs from their governments around the world
 ek na ek din vah apane ghar se lekar pados tak main naukariyon ko lekar dikhaae gaye sapanom kii hakeekat bhi jaan legi
 Numerous statistics show that economic inequality is increasing
 sau pachaas amir logon ke paas duniya kii aadhi sampatti he
 Of course, the rest have nothing or little
 duniya main abhi tak in sau pachaas logon kii sehat par koi asar nahin padaa he
 Will not na bharat main na america main

 yahaan bhi america main bhi
 The comments 240 saal ke loktantric itihaas main trump pehle hai jo kisi sainya seva main nahin rahe hai na hi kisi saarvajanik pad par rahe hai
 Becoming President at the age of 70
 is umr main pehla kaarykaal shuru karne vaale trump pehle hai
 Nobody knows when Trump will say what he will do
 trump kaa hi bayaan he ki ek desh ke rup main hamen anpredictable hona chahie
 That is, no one knows when to do what
 videsh niti ko lekar puri duniya kii nigaah un par he
 Will the US change the nuclear deal that Iran signed with Iran? trump kehete hai ki isse buree deal kabhi nahin hui hogi
 Are there going to be decisions like their statements
 agar trump ne apane bayanon ko faisle main badalanaa shuru kiya to kya hoga
 Such speculations are taking place
 kabhi kehete hai ki hame iran ke saath deal ke saath jeena hi hoga
 More concern is being expressed about his statements about climate change

 (inputs IANS se bhi) The dearness allowance for 50 lakh central government employees and 59 lakh pensioners can be increased by 2-4 per cent
 karmchaariyon or pensionbhogiyon par badhati mahangaai ke boj ko kam karne ke liye sarkaar is bhatte main ijapha karti he
 However, according to the formula of the Central Government, even after this increase, the employees will not get relief from the real inflation
 haalanki is prastaavit vruddhi se karmchaaree sangh or lebar union khush nahin hai

 jaane mahangaai bhatte se sambandhit 10 khaas baaten1
 According to the central government formula, a 2% increase will be given on dearness allowance, which will be implemented from 1 January 20176

 kendra sarkaar oktober main manhagaai bhatte main 2 fisadi kaa ijapha kar chuki he or use july 2016 se lagu kiya tha jisase ab vah sirf 2 fisadi kaa ijapha or karne ja rahi he
 The central government determines the dearness allowance by taking the average retail inflation data for the last 12 months
 6
 After approving the recommendations of the Pay Commission, the Central Government had announced that all employees would get enhanced salary and allowances from January 1, 2016, but after the demonetisation came into force, the Central Government is reluctant to take a final decision on the issue
 7
 After the decision on demonetisation, the Modi government constituted a committee to look into the recommendations of the Pay Commission on the allowance of Central employees
 is cameti ko vetan ayog kii siforeeshon ko lagu karne kaa rasta tay karne ke liye bhi kaha gaya he
 8
 sutron ke mutabik ashok lavasa ke netritv main bani cameti apni report sarkaar ko saunp chuki he
 But the central government is not able to give allowance to the employees because the shortage of cash in the country due to demonetisation is also disturbing the central government

 The committee has got two weeks' extra time for its report but sources told NDTV India that many members want the interim report to be submitted at the earliest, instead of waiting for two weeks
 bhagwant maan ne apane bachaav main cameti ke saamne di gai daleel main suraksha main kotahi ke kuch maamalon kaa zikr kiya he
 In it, Mann also mentioned the security agreement of a BJP MP
 tippaniyan All members of the committee believe that the security of Parliament is paramount but Mann's case should not be dragged politically and can be dropped by warning
 trinmul congress ke derick o bryan (jo cameti sadsy nahin hai) ne media se kaha, 'hamane maan kaa video dekha he
 His actions may be childish and wrong but his intentions do not seem to be wrong
 bhagwant maan ko suspend karke pehle hi sajaa di ja chuki he
 Investigations are also being conducted against him
 ab agar is maamle ko or ghasita jaataa he to galat he
 In such a situation, we will assume that this is being done in view of the coming (punjab) elections which will be wrong
 ' On the other hand, the BJP members of the committee have a tough stand

 aisa aksar nahin hota jab prayek udaarikaran or videshi meljol par bidakane vaale swadeshi or arthvyavastha ko kholane ke param pairokaar udaaravaadi ek hi ghat par dubkee lagaate najar aaen
 The Modi government has decided that India will now take loans from foreign markets through bonds
 ye bond bharat kii samprabhu saakh (sowerin reating) par aadhaarit honge
 This had never happened before
 sarkaar ke vichaar parivaar vaale roodhiwaadee swadeshiyon ko lagata he ki isse aasmaan fat padegaa or udaarvaadiyon ko lagata he ki surkhiyaan batorne ke shauk main modi sarkaar ek gaiyr-jaruri koshish kar rahi he jo mushkil main daalegi
 Both are fearlessly intimidating
 jabaki is dar ke aage jeet he
 a major reform can start from here
 videshi karj bharat ke liye nayaa nahin he
 The government has been receiving loans from multilateral institutions (world Bank, ADB) and countries (eg Japan for bullet trains)
 yah karj deshon yaa sanstha or desh ke bich hota he
 The debt market has no effect on this
 bhartiya companiyaan apni saakh ke badale duniya bhar se karj leti hai, jo sarkaar ke khate main darj nahin hota
 Most of the government's debt comes from within the country and is in rupees
 yah karj dollar main hoga or dollar main hi chukaana hoga
 This debt will increase as the dollar becomes expensive
 duniya ke anya deshon kii tarah, jo vishwa ke bazaaron se karj lete hai, bharat kii saakh kii reating hogi
 India's bonds will be listed in world markets
 bharat shuruyaat main keval kul das arab dollar jutanaa chahta he
 The advantage is that this loan will be available at almost half the cost of the domestic market
 is bond ke baad deshi bazaar se sarkaar kuch kam karj legi
 There is no immediate threat to India from this initiative
 is tarah ke videshi karj, jokhim ke jin paimaanon par maape jate hai, unamem bharat kii sthiti behatar he
 India's total sovereign foreign debt to GDP ratio is only 3
 8 fisad he
 The foreign exchange ($ 428 billion) debt ratio is also at a better level of 75 percent
 is tarah ke bond ke maamle main bharat kii tulana brazil, china, indonesia, mexico, philippines or thailand se honi chahie
 Foreign debt in proportion to India's total income 19
 8 fisad (indonesia, mexico 35 fisad se zyada) he
 In this, the foreign debt taken on sovereign guarantee is much less than that of China and Thailand
 swadeshi or vampanthi to 1991 or 95 main bhi daraa rahe the lekin bharat agar udaarikaran na karata to zyada bada nuksaan hota
 There should be news to those who fear that India already has a lot of foreign capital
 share bazaaron main videshi nivesh (433 arab dollar) or pratyaksh videshi nivesh yani epadi (325 arab dollar), darasal sarkaar (309 arab dollar) or companiyon par kul videshi karj (104 arab dollar) se bhi zyada he
 Therefore, the ten billion dollar sovereign debt will not cause a catastrophe, but if Modi government goes ahead with this decision then a big economic transparency will emerge
 bharat ko pehali baar global dollar suchakank kaa hissaa bananaa hoga
 This grade has great value and risk
 bharat sarkaar ko apane sabhi vittiya aankade paardarshee karne honge or ghaataa yaa karj chhipaane kii aadat chhodani hogi
 The government shows us half the incomplete picture of the debt and deficit of the Center and the states
 bainkon ke enpie, enbiensi kaa karj, bajet se baahar rakhe jane vaale karj jaise choti bachat scimen yaa sarkari companiyon par ladaa karj, credit card aadi ke karj, sarkari companiyon kaa ghaataa
 
 
 Investors of the world will no longer have to hide any information about economic health
 is bond se milane vaali raashi nahin balki yah mahatvapurn hoga ki bharat apane jokhim kaa prabandhan kaise karata he ab puri duniya ko vittiya paardarshita kaa vishwaas dilaanaa hoga jiske aadhaar par bharat kii samprabhu saakh tay hogi jo bataaegi ki duniya ke bazaar main ham kahaan khadey hai
 The rating we get abroad, the country's market will also give loans accordingly
 greece, turki, argentina, thailand, brazil ke jaale niveshak ab kisi ko bakhshate nahin hai
 Due to poor economic management, these countries had to face great punishment in the bond market
 sanad rahe ki greece isliye duba kyonki usne apana ghaataa chipaaya tha
 The bond market lies most with lies
 america raashtrapati bill clinton ke salaahkaar james carvil kehete the ki agar mujhe dobaaraa avatar mili to main raashtrapati yaa pope nahin balki bond market banuunga, jo har kisi ko daraa saktaa he
 Let the bonds come, only the fear of the world will help the Indian government change its ways

 It is extremely important for MBPT officers to extinguish the fire as soon as possible, as Port 1
 79 lakh kilolitre oil rakhata he aise main ye haadasa or bhi bheeshan ho saktaa he
 According to Rahangadale, "there was good coordination between Mumbai firefighters and Mumbai Port Trust (MBPT) fire fighters
 agnishman karmi tanks ke 10 foot kii duuri tak pahunch gayi the, lekin tanks main aag ke phir se bhadakne ke kaaran subah hamaare saamne ek nayi chunauti aa gayi
 The fire has been controlled
 ’’unhone bataaya, ‘‘main is puure abhiyaan kii nigaraanee kar rahaa hum, kyonki garmi ke kaaran aag bujhane ke kaam main istemaal hone vaala fom thik se vyavasthit nahin ho rahaa he, isaki vajah se aag phir se bhadak ja rahi he
 But overall the situation is under control
 ’’ rahangdale ne yah spasht nahin kiya ki yah abhiyaan abhi or kitni der tak chalegaa
 "our main challenge is to keep the other tanks safe from fire," he said
 isliye ek ore hamaare agnishman karmi anya tinkon ko surakshit rakhane ke liye thanda karne ke kaam main jute hai, to duusari ore vah aag bujhane ke kaam main bhi lage hai

 The Samajwadi Party (SP) is also beginning to doubt Rahul's ability

 " Hong Kong-based tech company Sound One launched its neckband-style X60 wireless headphones in India in the month of February
 bluetooth connactivity vaale is headphone ko mujeec or kol donon ke liye hi dizin kiya gaya he
 The company has priced it at Rs 3,490, although Flipkart is currently available for Rs 1,890
 hamane is headphone ko kaaphi dinon tak yuj kiya he or ab ham iskaa rivyuu aap tak pahunchaa rahe hai
 Design and Build Quality: Talking about the design of this wireless headphone, it is quite light in weight
 neckband vaale kisi bhi headphone main divaais ke halke or patale hone kii kaaphi samasya hoti he
 In such a situation it is fine
 dikhne main ye zyada premium nahin he naa hi isaki packaging main koi aakarshan he
 The rubber has a soft rubber coating over the band
 die gaye batan kaa dizin bhi kuch zyada khaas nahin he
 Here, one touch button has been given to activate the virtual assistant in the left side
 vahiin ride said main multi function batan or wolum buttens die gaye hai
 There are functions like call cut-receive and redial, including turning on and off with multi function buttons, and pressing and holding the plus button in the volume buttons increases the volume and changes the track once pressed
 isi tarah wolum buttens main negative batan kaam karata he
 This reduces the volume
 iske alaava yearplugs kii baat karen to ye chote dizin vaale hai
 In this case, they fit easily in the ears and do not prick in the ears
 lekin ye yearplag jis vir se band se conect kiye gaye hai or wo bahut everej vir hai
 Touching their quality also gives a very average feel and according to the look it looks very low level
 mumkin ye bhi he ki jaraa sa khinch jane par ye vir tut kar alag ho jaae
 Here the earplugs have magnets in the rear of the drivers, which keeps them glued in case they are not used
 haalanki ye magnet baaki duusari companiyon ke yearplag magnet kii tarah koi or function nahin karata he
 Performance and Audio Quality: First of all talk about connectivity, Bluetooth 4 here
 2 kaa saport diya gaya he
 In such a situation, it is quite compatible for smartphones, computers and audio players
 saath hi connactivity main koi pareshaani bhi nahin aati
 Headphones are also easily connected to smartphones due to auto connectivity
 isaki connactivity range 10m tak he jo behatar he
 Now speaking of audio quality, the range of Sound One X60 is up to 20-20,000hz
 saath hi yahaan behatar quality ke liye kwalkom ke aptx codec technology kaa bhi istemaal kiya gaya he
 Talking about the audio quality, we heard a lot of music in this headphones like - classical, rock, jazz, reggaeton, deep house, acoustic, EDM, trance and dubstep from headphones and found that this Lows means better for the base is
 vahiin Mids or Highs main kaaphi kamjor he
 That is, you will be able to enjoy the average sound quality here
 yahaan base bhi aapako panchi nahin lagegi or baaki tarah ke mujeec main aapako saaf taur par crisp kii kami lagegi
 However, the good thing is that even after raising your voice completely, you will not have to face any bad voice
 iske baad wais batan kii baat karen to ye thik thaak hi kaam karata he
 After all, when talking about calling, this headphone is worth a compliment here
 kyonki colling main kaaphi clarity bhi aapako milegi, saath hi connactivity bhi behatar milegi or kisi tarah ke bahari nois se aap pareshaan nahin honge
 Battery: Finally, in terms of battery performance, according to the company's claim, it can be run for 8 to 10 hours on a single charge and here the company's claim is correct
 hamen bydaree ko lekar koi dikkat nahin ai
 Also, it takes 2 hours to charge
 ek kharaab baat ye he is headphone ki kii bydaree 20 pratishat hote hi ye aapako lagaataar ring alert detaa he, aise main kisi mujeec yaa video ko lo bydaree main dekhte vakt pareshaan ho sakate hai
 Verdict: It is an average wireless neckband headphone overall
 philhal ise 1,890 rupee main uplabdh karaayaa ja rahaa he
 At this price, money can be put on this lightweight headphone
 base ke liye ye headphone thik he lekin overol audio quality main crisp nahin milegaa
 The other drawback is in its look and wire
 saath hi magnet main kuch function jode ja sakate the
 However, if you want to invest a little more money, you can buy Samsung's Level u Bluetooth headset for Rs 2,499

 SC used the powers given in Article 142 of the Constitution, Sunni Central Waqf Board did not give land separately
 The Supreme Court of the country decided to hand over the disputed land of Ayodhya to Ramlala Virajman and to give 5 acres of land for mosque to Muslims
 Is narrated iske saath hi ayodhya kaa sadiyon purana vivaad lambii sunwaayee or kanoonee jirah ke baad shanivaar ko supreme court ke faisle se saath nipat gaya
 The Supreme Court's verdict on the Ayodhya dispute is clear that it did not want to leave any scope for any kind of proviso
 lihaaja desh kii sarvocch adaalat ne elahabaad hoicourt ke faisle ko darkinar karte hue aadesh diya ki ayodhya kii vivaadit jameen ramalala virajman ko di ja rahi he
 With this, the Supreme Court has decided the future of both the temple and the mosque
 supreme court ke is faisle ke baad muslim pakshakaar ikbaal ansarine khushi jataai or kaha ki wo iske khilaaf apil nahin karnaa chaahate hai
 Now the question is, under which law did the Supreme Court order the Central Government to form a trust and hand over 5 acres of land to the Sunni Waqf Board to hand over the disputed land of Ayodhya to Ram Lala Virajman? The Sunni Central Waqf Board also did not appeal to the Supreme Court to relocate the 5-acre land

 Till now, in the student union elections of the university, CYSS could not show anything special, due to which the Aam Aadmi Party was fiercely gritty

 lakshmi gaanv bhi gumsum he kyonki khamoshi kii ye kasak in bejubaanon ke zehan main ghar kar gayi he ki ab wo apane maalik ke ghar sehameshaa ke liye judahone ja rahi hai
 In fact, Kapil Mishra had two cows in his house, named Laxmi and Bholi, and two calves of these two cows also called Nandini and Shiva
 kapil ke parivaar ke ahm sadsy ban chuke ye chaaron ab mantri nivas khaali hone ke chalate saath nahin rah paaenge
 Actually, Kapil Mishra had vacated this house with his family 2 days before but he had to come here daily to take care of his four animals only
 isaki vajah yah thi ki desh main is samay kathith gorakshakon kaa jo dar bana hua he uske chalate unki gaayon ko tampu main le jane ke liye koi bhi raji nahin tha
 Therefore a letter of permission was taken from the police and these cows were taken from the house of Kapil Mishra under police protection
 kapil ke ghar main gaay kii dekhbhaal karne vaale ashok, ek gaay nandini ko apane ghar bulandashahar le janaa chaahate the lekingorakshakon kaa daraunke gaay prem par baari pad gaya or wo ye kadam nahin uthaa paye
 Apparently, Bholi, Lakshmi, Nandini, Shiva do not know what the minister's residence is and how many days they have to evacuate due to the notice
 jaanavar sirf prem kii bhashaa samajhataa he or isi prem ke chalate ye ghar chhod jane ke liye tampoo main chadhane ko taiyaar nahin dikhaa
 But if the former minister did not do so before the government's decree, then how did these unique animals go? lakshmi, nandini, bholi or shiva ko kapil mishra kaa sarkari ghar chhodkar janaa hi padaa

 The Shiv Sena has written in its mouthpiece Saamana that Indira Gandhi partitioned Pakistan and created Bangladesh but this nation too eventually went the path of Pakistan
 shivasena ne kaha ki bangladesh main hinduon ke mandir par hamalaa or ladakiyon kaa jabaran dharmantaran karne main bangladeshi sabase aage hai
 The Shiv Sena said that it is not appropriate to make a foreign person a part of the electoral process in the country and to campaign for a particular political party
 shivasena ne sawaal uthaate hue kaha ki bangladeshi abhinayta kaa bijness vija par aakar trinmul kii prachaar sabhaaon main shaamil hona kitna sahi he
 However, Shiv Sena has not said anything about the grant of visas by the Union Home Ministry
 shivasena ne apane mukhpatr saamana main kaha ki bangladeshi pradhanmantri shaikh hasina ne desh ke saath rishta banaakar rakhaa he, lekin baaki sabhi logon ne hamaare saath dwesh hi kiya he
 Shiv Sena said that infiltration of Bangladeshi Muslims is also a matter of concern for the security of the country, yet a party like Trinamool is looking towards these intruders as a vote bank
 vot bank ko khush karne ke liye hi yah sab kiya ja rahaa he
 The Shiv Sena said that Modi's opponents do not miss a single opportunity to make poisonous remarks
 vahiin trinmul congress kii is harakat par rahul gandhi or sharad pavaar chup hai
 It was said in the face that when Shiv Sena talks about evacuating Bangladeshi infiltrators from Mumbai, parties like Trinamool and Congress create confusion in the mind of Bengali people

 Today is Loknayak Jayaprakash Narayanaki's 116th birth anniversary
 unka janm 11 oktober 1902 main hua tha
 Jayaprakash Narayan, a fighter and politician of the Indian freedom struggle, was known for his opposition to former Prime Minister Jawahar Lalnehruki's daughter and former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and is said to have lost power from Indira Gandhi's hand because of her movement
 aise shuru hui indira gandhi ke khilaaf krantiindira gandhi ke shashan ke dauraan desh mahangaai samet muddon ko lekar jujh rahaa tha or logon ke man main indira kii aguwai vaali centre sarkaar ko lekar gussa tha
 At that time Jayaprakash Narayan decided to raise his voice against the power and wrote a letter to Indira Gandhi and told about the deteriorating situation in the country
 uske baad desh ke anya saansadon ko bhi patr likhaa or kai indira gandhi ke kai faislon ko loktantric khatra bataaya
 This letter from Lokpal was demanded by Jayaprakash Narayan, creating a ruckus in the political world, because for the first time someone raised a direct voice against Indira Gandhi
 saath hi unhone saansadon ko liye apane patr main lokapal banane or lokayukta ko niyukt karne kii maang kii thi
 At the same time, Narayan also accused Indira Gandhi of suppressing the voice of the committee formed against corruption
 gujarat se hui shuruyatvahin, indira gandhi ne rajyon kii congress sarkaron se chanda lene kii maang kii
 During this time, the then Chief Minister of Gujarat had also demanded 10 lakh rupees from Chiman Bhai and the prices of many things were increased to increase the fund
 jiske baad pradesh main andolan hue or police kii barbarta se kai andolankaaree maare gaye
 During this, the date of resignation of the Chief Minister was fixed on 24 January 1974
 lekin chiman bhai ke ravaiye se andolan or bhadak gaya
 Jayaprakash Narayan then supported the movement, after which he was called to Gujarat
 bataa den, 5 june 1974 ko jepi ne indira gandhi ke khilaaf sampurna kranti kaa naaraa diya tha
 Before Jayaprakash Narayan went to Gujarat, he tried to hold power in his hand through the governor and on 9 February 1974, two days before Jayaprakash Narayan came to Gujarat, he resigned Chimanbhai and imposed President's rule in the state
 uske baad morarji desai ne narayan ke saath dobaaraa chunaav karwaane kii maang kii
 At the same time, this movement also spread to other states like Bihar
 uske baad railway ke lakhon karmchaaree hadtaal par chale gaye, jisase indira gandhi ke saamne dikkat khadi hone lagi ki aakhir pehle kisase nipta jaae?bihar main andolan kaa prabhavabihar main bhi gujarat kii tarah chaatro ne andolan kiya or vidhansabha kii ore kooch kiya
 After that action was taken against the students, firing them, in which many students were killed and JP was demanded to command the movement
 haalanki jepi ne andolan kii kaman sanbhaalane se pehle kaha ki is andolan main koi bhi vyakti kisi bhi party se judaa hua nahin hona chahie
 After that people took all their demands and the students associated with political parties also decided to resign and go with JP
 isamen congress ke bhi kai chaatr shaamil the or sabhi chaatr bihar chaatr sangharsh samiti ke binar tale andolan main kud gaye
 After this, JP took command of the movement in his hand and demanded the resignation of Bihar Chief Minister Abdul Ghafoor
 jepi kii chetavaneeus dauraan jepi ne ki unki bhashtrachaar kalabazari aadi ke khilaaf ladaai jari he or unhone andolan ko jari rakhane kii baat kahi
 After that Indira Gandhi said on the basis of Jayaprakash Narayan that some people are trying to get into active politics by losing their interest in village development
 uske baad isse congressiyon samet kai log iskaa virodh karne lage
 After that, the movement grew with Indira's anti-jayaprakash statements and Jayaprakash Narayan made the movement sharper
 uske baad jaiprakash narayan ne sarkaar ko hataane ko lekar andolan tej kar diya
 This movement shook power
 On 8 April 1974, Jayaprakash Narayan took out a procession to protest, in which the angry public took part against the power
 isamen hajaaron hi nahin lakhon logon ne bhaag liya or khud jaiprakash narayan ne isaki aguwai kii thi
 This movement of Jayaprakash Narayan led to the slipping of power from under Indira Gandhi and later Indira Gandhi faced so much opposition that there was not much time left in her hands
 jaiprakash narayan ne aazaadee ke baad hi nahin, usase pehle bhi gandhi ke saath bharat chodo jaise andolanon ko safal banaaya tha
 The Supreme Court has asked the Delhi Development Authority on the sealing case that we will not remove the ban on the amendment of the master plan

 asia cap ke liye dhaka pahunchane ke baad viraat kohli or rohit sharma kai ghante tak pakistani phiraki gendbaaj said ajmal ke video dekhte rahe
 In this affair, he skipped the day's dinner and also a practice session
 jab 18 march ko pakistani cricketron ne dressing room main ikattha hokar apane purv coach bob woolmer ko yaad karte hue vishwa cap ke semifinal main bharat ke haathon hui haar kaa badla lene kii kasam khai, to kohli ne sharma ke kaan main chupake se kaha, ‘hamane to (is match ke liye) apana homework kar liya he
 'but when Pakistan made 329 runs, then other players including captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni also realized that the goal was not that easy
 upar se jab salaami ballebaaj gautam gambhir pari kii duusari hi gend par pagabaadha out hokar bina khaataa khole laut pade to us vakt stadium main pasra khaufnak sannata apane aap main bahut kuch bayaan kar rahaa tha
 But it was here that a historic moment of world cricket was taking shape
 duusare chor par khadey cricket ke 'bhagwaan' sachin tendulkar kaa saath dene utre, dilli ke 23 varshiya yuva cricketer kohli
 They were not at all affected by the conditions, despite India having lost one wicket without opening the account
 unke preranastrot or wicket par jodidar tendulkar pichley match main shatakon kaa shatak puraa kar chuke the, haalanki bharat vah match bangladesh se haar gaya tha
 But both did not look back in that match against Pakistan
 sher-e-bangla neshnal stadium par kohli ke dandanaate 183 ranon ne pakistan ke jabardast hamale ko taar-taar kar daalaa
 It was India's biggest win in one-day matches chasing goals
 kohli ne tendulkar se mili us khitaab ko sarthak kar diya, jisamen unhone unhen 'master of da chej' yani peechha karte hue lakshya hasil karne main ustad khilaadi kaha tha
 This was Kohli's fourth century in Bangladesh
 yah bhi jaananaa dilachasp hoga ki kohli kii puri pari ke dauraan master blaster team ke dressing room main ek hi jagah par jame baithe rahe
 His superstitions adopted during matches against Pakistan have become interesting legends of the history of cricket
 ek baar to ve match ke dauraan puure samay nahaate rahe or harbhajan singh se lagaataar camentry sunate rahe
 This is a matter of one day in Lahore, in which India won
 lekin is baar cricket ke nae poster bvoy main unki aasthaa ko bharat-pakistan mukaable ke sthal mirpur main sabane apni ankhon se dekha or saraahaa
 Despite this blast, the Indian team could not reach the final of the Asia Cup
 par yah toornament kohli ke ek paripakv or aadhunik cricketer main tabdeel hone kii kahani to likh hi gaya
 Statistics also tell the story of the success of the new vice-captain of India's ODI team
 lakshya kaa peechha karte hue kheli gai 48 pariyon main kohli ke ranon kaa ausat 58
 Has been 40
 isamen unhone saat shatak or 13 ardhshtak lagaae hai
 That is why he has also got the honor of the best ODI player in the world
 dilli kii ranjai team main kohli ke saath khel chuke mithun mimhas unke is fauladi jazbe se parichit hai
 He says, 'no one can question his determination
 ’disambar, 2006 main karnataka ke khilaaf dilli main ek ranjai match ke dauraan viraat ke vakil pita prem kohli kii tadake teen baje maut ho gai
 He had not been out the previous evening
 agali subah ballebaaji karke dilli ko haar se bachaane ke liye unhone pita kii antyeshti ko taal diya
 Mithun says, 'virat had scored 90 at that time
 ham sabane usase poocha ki kya vah match chhodkar antyeshti main janaa chahega? usne sidhe manaa kar diya or pad daal liye
 He was actually angry with the umpire's decision to give out and was in a mood to argue with him
 ’kaiyon kaa daawa he ki us ghatana ne kohli ko badal diya
 Two years later, Kohli led the Indian team to victory in the World Cup under 19 and was completely immersed in cricket
 purv bhartiya captain bishan singh bedi kehete hai, ‘usne khud ko khel main jhenk diya
 He only played cricket while away from glitter
 ’purv bhartiya chayankarta yashpal sharma ne coach rajkumaar sharma ke saath kohli ko kareeb se dekha he
 They believe that Kohli is the new Wonder Boy of Indian cricket: 'he is like a new Tendulkar
 use bina taraasha hua yuvi yaa sahvaag bhi kah sakate hai
 His batting strength is amazing
 ’ kohli apane khel main lagaataar paripakv ho rahe hai
 And, as former selector Dilip Vengsarkar says, there is tremendous talent in batting
 haalanki, pehle ve leg said par hi shots khelte the
 He has become the most trusted middle-order batsman in the Indian team by enabling himself to apply strokes around the field
 cricket ke jaankaron ne un par ekadivasiy cricket ke sarvshereshth ballebaaj kii muhar pehle hi laga di he
 In cricket-crazy country India, people like his aggressive attitude and young face
 iske jariye ve captaini kii kursi tak aasaani se pahunch sakate hai
 Royal Challengers Bangalore have made him the mascot of the IPL team
 kohli ne hi 2009 or 2010 main final main jagah dilaai
 And the 2011 Champions League Twenty20 showed the team the way to the finals
 pichley teen maheenon se jeet or ranon kii bhukhi bhartiya cricket team main unke power game ne nai jaan foonki he
 His magic has started to appear in the advertising world, where his value has crossed 3 crores after the latest game in Bangladesh
 hamalaa hi takattikkar aakraamak hona kohli kaa funda haiyah chote kad kaa viraat khilaadi cricket kii duniya main bulandiyon kii ore bad rahaa he
 Virat's runs have become a guarantee of victory
 halaat kitne hi mushkil kyon na hon, viraat agar krij par hai to no tension
 Virat has played three big innings in Hobort (australia), a storm of 136 off 86 balls, first Sri Lanka in Mirpur and then Pakistan's wash, not one or two in less than a month
 antarrashtriya cricket main vahi khilaadi kaamyaab he jo achche pradarshan kaa silsilaa banaae rakhe or team ko match jitaaye
 The 23-year-old Virat meets both the criteria
 dabaav main saadhaaran khilaadi bikhar jate hai lekin bade or bhi nikhar jate hai
 Virat falls into the second category, the more difficult the batting condition
 australia main sibi siries ke apane aakhri lig match main team india ko bonus point ke saath jeet kii darkaar thi, shuruaati jatke ke baad viraat aae or shuru kar di ranon kii barsaat, kisi ne bhi nahin sochaa tha ki viraat naam ke is tufaan ke aage srilankai gendbaaj is tarah bebas ho jaaenge
 Bowlers like Lasith Malinga of Sri Lanka, known for their yorker balls at the Death Overs, are still in shock after washing
 asia cap main usee tarah se pakistan kii pes bydaree unke hathe chadh gai
 But on both occasions, there was a tight chance of not reaching the finals
 pichley saal vishwacap jeetne ke baad se team india kaa graph neeche gir rahaa he lekin kohli kaa groph utaar-chadhaav dekhne ke baad ab upar kii ore bad rahaa he
 It was not so easy for them
 westeindies main mushkil test siries ke baad unke sambhavit 11 main hone par hi sawaal puche jane lage the
 The tour of England also did not show continuity
 haalanki centuri unhone jarur lagaai
 When the West Indies came to India, there was a new legend, a batsman who had learned from his mistakes and was determined not to repeat them
 australia daure par test siries main iklauti centuri viraat ne hi lagaai
 Virat deepened his relationship with Mirpur in the Asia Cup on the basis of his superb form
 mirpur main khele pichley 4 maichon main se ve 3 main shatak laga chuke hai
 That's why they call Mirpur their lucky ground, 'this ground is special for me
 mujhe bhi yahaan ballebaaji karnaa bahut acha lagata he
 'bat against Pakistan was often duped, but in the Asia Cup this complaint was also removed
 ve kehete hai, ‘pakistan ke khilaaf intjaar karnaa padaa
 Glad that this wait also ended with Century
 ’lekin team main gautam gambhir ke rahete viraat ko up-captaini? kya itani kam umr main unhen yah jimmedaari dena sahi faisla he? kya chayankarta unhen bhavi captain ke taur par taiyaar kar rahe hai? ye ve tamaam sawaal the, jinka jawaab viraat ne apane balle se diya
 Their performance in the Asia Cup is enough to tell that now they are preparing themselves for every responsibility
 pichley 4 saal main ballebaaj ke taur par ve khaase paripakv ho chuke hai
 They also have temperament and technology
 australia ho, england yaa phir asian up-mahadweep, viraat har condishan main ran banane main sakasham hai
 There is a 'male' for hitting fours and sixes, and the ability to decorate the innings
 yahi vajah he ki ve yang brigade kaa sabase kaamyaab cheharaa hai
 Team India have won 10 of the 11 centuries Virat scored in One Day
 hamalaa viraat kii takat he, to kabhi-kabhi kamajori bhi
 Whether to attack the opponents or their celebrations, they bring them to the headlines
 yahi vajah he ki jaankaar unhen apni aakraamakata ko kaabo main rakhane kii salaah dete hai
 Virat was so baffled by the taunting of some fans on the Australian tour that he also forgot the dignity
 aise halaat main kaise sanyam rakhana he, ab yahi viraat ko siikhnaa he
 They also appear to be trying
 asia cap main ve kaaphi relax dikhe, har vakt hansate, majaak karte hue
 He loves listening to music and reading books
 tennis ke sheersh khilaadi rahe andre agasi kii aatmakatha open viraat kii sabase pasandida kitaab he
 The batsman of Team India, who scored an innings of 183 runs, proved to be a successful captain
 pehle saurav ganguli or phir mahendra singh dhoni
 So are they also going to be included in the list of potential successful captains? His idol Tendulkar clarifies, 'he is a very good player but he should not be pressurized a lot from now
 ’ jaahir he, unhen abhi kai or imtahaan dene honge

 aksar dopaher kaa khaanaa khaane ke baad jyadatar logon ko neend aane lagati he
 But have you ever tried to know why this happens? Let's know the exact reason for this
 haal hi main hui ek study main bataaya gaya he ki dopaher kaa khaanaa khaane ke baad dimag ke kaam karne kii kshamta dhimi ho jaati he
 Those involved in the study have confirmed that their attention and response to a task decrease after the intake of glucose and sugar
 study main shaamil kuch logon ne jahaan glucose or sugar kaa seven kiya
 At the same time, some people consumed fructose and artificial sweet items
 jiske baad dekha gaya ki fructose kaa seven karne vaale logon ke mukaable glucose or sugar ke seven karne vaale logon kaa unke kaam main dhyaan nahin lag rahaa tha
 Also, their ability to respond to something was also seen to decrease
 munh se thookkar khaanaa banaati he yah mahila, video dekh aapako ulti aa sakati hayhaalanki, isse pehle ek study main yah kaha gaya tha ki glucose ke seven se chizon ko yaad rakhane kii kshamta main sudhaar aata he
 But the new study has proved this wrong
 'psychology and bihaviour' jarnal main prakashit is study main lagbhag 49 logon ko shaamil kiya gaya
 All these people consumed sweet drinks which included glucose, sucrose, fructose
 iske seven ke baad unhen gyaan-sambandhi pariksha hal karne ke liye di gai
 Do obese people feel less cold than thin people? The results showed that those who consumed glucose and sucrose performed worse on the test than those who consumed fructose

 asaram ke bete narayan sai se lekar, patni lakshmi or beti bharti par bhi aaropon ke kathghare main hai
 Look out notice has been issued by Surat Police
 baba jail main or bete kii karatuuton kaa pardaafash ho rahaa he
 The revelation is made on Narayan Sai
 vahi narayan sai, jinhen sweetheart bhagwaan kahlaana acha lagata he
 Narayan Sai has got so many love letters of girls, anyone will be stunned by listening and reading
 suna tha kahin ki mohabbat khuda he, padhaa tha ki bhagwaan or bhakt ke bich prem kaa ek atoot bandhan hota he
 The film was also made on Love Is God, such love of devotees for a god, such love letters, such love letters written in the name of God, immersed in the light of desire, neither ever passed through eyes nor before
 The words of such a letter written in the name of the boy hit the ears
 narayan sai ke naam dheron lav lettersrs aae hai or in lettersrs ko dekhakar aapako inaki ashikamizaaji kaa andaja ho jayega
 In these love letters, a girlfriend calls Narayan Sai, sweetheart, someone writes My Heart, some Shayari, some is writing song lyrics, and someone openly declares that you are mine-i am yours
 inaki kai mashooqaaon ne to likhaa he-ai nid you, ai waant you, ai lav you
 a girlfriend wants to talk to Bhagwana on the phone every day, that is, God has now entered the mobile from the heart
 narayan sai kii ek premika to aisi he, jiskaa lav letters pard kar yahi lagata he ki wo bhagwaan ke kaaphi kareeb rahi he
 She mentions a date in the letter and writes that it has been a month since they met and she is missing God, while in another love letter a girlfriend writes that please God - one more thing i want , do you know
 main uske liye intjaar karuungi
 The love letter mentions the beauty of God and his fragrance

 You swear to me, never parted or angry with me
 kasam todane main mar jaaoongi dhyaan rakhana
 Whomever you catch, he can never leave you
 plis or chizon main apni pakad bhale naa rakho, par mujhe pakadakar rakhe
 Please God, one more thing i want, i will wait for that

 dilli main kaamanwealth khelon kaa aayojan hue 7 saal guzar gaye hai, lekin isaki nishaniyaan abhi baaki hai
 It is a sign that reminds of the errands and scams of the then government, while some are also highlighting the negligence and failure of the present government
 ye baat hairaan kar sakati he ki kaamanwealth games kaa maujuuda sarkaar se kya rishta ho saktaa he, lekin yah sach he ki kaamanwealth khelon se judi kuch chizein aisi hai, jinhen dekhne ke baad yah aasaani se kaha or samajha ja saktaa he ki maujuuda sarkaar kahaan naakaam rahi he or kis tarah usase chook hui he
 Let us first tell you the story of Ring Road, called the lifeline of Delhi, which describes the failure of the present government
 isaki tasdik kaamanwealth khelon ke dauraan hue kaamon se hoti he
 If you look at the road from Lajpat Nagar near Ashram to Maharani Bagh, CWG 2010 is written in the right hand line, which was written to identify the reserve lane
 is len ko khilaadiyon ko laane le jane or immergency vaahanon kii awajahi ke liye reserve kiya gaya tha
 There was an invoice of Rs 2000 for driving in this lane on the ring road
 isaki jaankaree isliye kyonki is len ke niyam or jurmaana bhale hi ab khatm ho gaya ho, lekin is len par jagah-jagah ibaarat ke taur par likhaa seedbluji 2010 abhi bhi maujuud hai or yah is baat kii nishaani he ki ab tak sambandhitsadakon kii marammatya phir unhen kharaab hone par phir se nahin banaaya gaya he
 This issue is also relevant because the government claims to fill the pits of the roads, to build new roads and to recirculate the damaged roads
 lekin peedblyoody ke adhikaar main aane vaali sadakon par gadde hi gadde hai, aise main yah aasaani se samajha ja saktaa he ki pichley 7 saalon main ring road jaisisadakon kii sud nahili gai he
 Why Ring Road itself? Many of the major roads of Delhi which were built during the Commonwealth Games have not been taken care of and today in many places these roads are in bad condition
 dilli sarkaar kii taraf se koi is mudde par pratikriya dene ke liye uplabdh nahin ho sakaa, lekin bijepi ke media pramukh praveen shankar kapur ke mutabik yah maujuuda sarkaar kii naakaami he or saboot he ki dilli main saare kaam thap pade hai
 Even the work of repairing roads is not being done, in such a way, it is a distant thing to build new roads and flyovers

 2009 march main srilanka cricket team ke khilaadiyon ke bas par hamale ke baad se pakistan main koi bhi international match nahin hua he
 If the Indian cricket team goes there, it will be a big deal for Pakistan
 suraksha chintaaon ke kaaran vahaan koi desh khilne nahin janaa chahta he
 Pakistan played an entire series in India in 2007, before that in 2006, the Indian cricket team went there
 bharat-pakistan kaa cricket match ko duniya main sabase spardhaatmak khel mana jaataa he
 More than one billion people watch this match on TV
