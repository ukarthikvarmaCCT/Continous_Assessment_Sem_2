 narayanan samet desh kii suraksha or guptchar agenciyon ke pramukhon ke saath niyamit baithken karke tatkaal apana kaam shuru kar diya
 The attacks in Mumbai have shown how flawed the security system of the country is and how mite it is
 suraagon ke jariye tah tak pahunchane or hamalon ko roak paane main chaahe guptchar agenciyon kii naakaami ho, hamalaa shuru hone par hataahaton kii sankhya nunatam rahe is sambandh main tatkaal or kargar tareeke se datane main antakawaad virdohi daston kii aakshamata ho, laachaar hokar tamaasha dekhati rahi alp prashikshit or ghatiya hathiyaaron se las shahar kii police ho yaa vah gaiyr-asardaar kanoon hon jo aatankwaadiyon ko roak paane ke bajaae hakeekat main unamem saahas paidaa karte hai, itnaa spasht he ki suraksha vyavastha main puri tarah kayapalat kii jarurat he
 The Mumbai attack was unprecedented in reach and directly challenged the authority of the Indian state
 haal ke itihaas main is tarah kii manshaa vaale teen bade hamale hue hai
 The first was an attack on the Parliament of the country in 2001, the second one targeted the Akshardham temple in 2002 and the third was to attack the Ramlala statue in Ayodhya in July 2005
 sankhya or pahunch ke lihaaj se haalanki bheedbhad vaale ilaakon main kaayartapurna dhamaakon main vruddhi hui he, lekin uparokt chaar hamale aise the jinase desh ke bheetar maar-kaat bhadak uthne kii kshamta thi
 All of them were neatly planned and included highly motivated terrorists who were trained as commandos
 unhone shaayad kuch sthaneey samarthakon kii sahaayta se hamale kii kai baar reharsal bhi kii thi
 Despite this, the people responsible for the security system of the country, especially its many intelligence agencies, do not learn any lesson from the previous terrorist attacks
 isi vajah se mumbai kii traasadee paidaa hui
 Increase intelligence, though blaming each other continues, but the fact is that the attack took place and intelligence reports were not implemented
 guptchar vyavastha kii teen sarvocch ikaiyaan-aantarik khufiagiri kaa jimmedaar guptchar beuro (ibi), bahari khufiagiri kaa prabharee research and analysis wing (ro) or pratiraksha guptchar agency (diie)-zyaadaatar swatantra rahakar kaam karti hai or ek-duusare se sahyog nahin karti hai
 Despite the formation of a multi-agency coordination committee (MACC) two years ago to coordinate among them and share intelligence reports, officials acknowledge that the system is not effective

 malik kehete hai, ''yah baat stabdh karne vaali he ki mumbai main hamale kaa muqabla karne ke liye koi sanyukt niyantran kaman gathit nahin kii gai
 The wrought iron walls of the bureaucracy should be toppled
 iske bajaae nichle paimaane par guptchar reporton kaa teji se aadan-pradaan hona chahie, jisamen vibhinn staron par unka akalan kiya jaae
 Girishchandra Saxena, the former head of RAW and chairman of the committee that presented the report on reforms in intelligence in 2001, said that most of his recommendations remained 'under consideration'
 vibhinn baton ke alaava saxena kii report ne sifarish kii thi ki desh kii pramukh guptchar agency ibi main field duty main kam-se-kam 30,000 karmchaariyon ko tainaat kiya janaa chahie
 But the real facts are shocking
 ibi main karmchaariyon kii kul sankhya 25,000 he, jinamein se ek-tihaai driver, chaparasi or prashaskeey tathaa sachivalay str ke karmchaaree hai
 The field duty staff is just 3,500, most of whom are posted in political intelligence

 Apparently in a country with a population of 2 billion, this number is equal to salt in flour
 ibi ke ek varisht adhikari kaa kahana tha ki maanviya, takneekee or sanchaalan ke lihaaj se is vyavastha main sudhaar laana jaruri he
 To strengthen the intelligence gathering system, about Rs 1,000 crore
 kii rakam darkaar he
 While terrorists keep changing their working methods and the technology used, intelligence officers are clinging to their old ways of thinking
 desh bhar kii rajya guptchar shakhaaen, jinka upyog amuman sattarudh partiyon ke paksh main rajnatik khufia suchanaaen jutaney ke liye kiya jaataa he, puraane jamaane ke usee dharre par kaam karti raheen, jinase chirkaalin andhepan main hi ijapha hota rahaa
 The result is that he even stopped caring about warnings
 rajyon main guptchari ko majboot banane ke liye gathit samiti, jiske sadsy maharashtra, dilli, andhra pradesh, karnataka, assam or uttar pradesh ke police mahanideshak hai, kii baithak to pichley do saal main ek baar bhi nahin hui he
 Suresh Arora, the intelligence chief of the Punjab Police, says, "in the absence of any recognition or reward, there is no one to ask the detective in the police department at this time
 ''guptchar agenciyaan kargar tareeke se or mil-julkar kaam kar saken, iske liye krantikari samaadhaanon kii sakht jarurat he
 Some experts advocate reforms at the summit, especially from Narayanan's role
 un par abhi bahari or andruni khataron donon se hi nibatane kaa bhaar he or shaayad unke paas donon ke liye jaruri achook dhyaan dene kaa vakt nahin he
 Others point to the need for major structural changes, including the formation of a National Intelligence and Security Authority that not only has an advisory role but also executive powers to coordinate intelligence, counter-terrorism and investigative agencies
 
 isamen iees or ipies kii tarah desh ke paimaane par alag guptchar seva kaa hona bhi shaamil he
 Some more suggest that the Home Ministry be converted into a larger home security ministry, which has so many broad powers to bring all agencies including intelligence, immigration, customs and Coast Guard under it
 prayek vikalp ke apane nafe-nuksaan hai
 They should be implemented immediately by arguing
 kanoon ke kade hathamanmohan adhik maryaadit kendriya jaanch agency par jor de rahe hai, jo antarraji nihitarth vaale or aantarik suraksha ko prabhavit karne vaale maamalon ko dekhe
 The Ministry of Home Affairs is already working on such a format, which mainly aims to amend the National Security Act of 1980
 is praaroop main ek rashtriya suraksha praadhikaran kii kalpana kii gai he, jo desh bhar main aatankwaad se jude aparaadhon kii sabhi kism kii jaanch ko puraa karne or uski nigaraanee ke liye jimmedaar hoga
 This authority will have five members under one chairman and will also prosecute the accused
 prayek rajya main ek suraksha ayukta tainaat kiya jayega-jo behatar he, ucch pad par asin koi ipies adhikari ho-jisaki javabdehi sidhe praadhikaran ke prati hogi
 In addition to the stringent provisions regarding bail in the draft, provisions for speedy courts and capital punishment are also included and it involves the government jamming the bank accounts of a person accused of terrorism and its open and hidden supporters and sponsors as well as his bank accounts
 Arrangements have also been made to do this
 isamen aatankwaadi karravaayiyon ke liye paisa jamaa karne yaa unako pryojit karne, unke saath milakar sajeesh rachane, unhen panaah dene athwa gavaahon ko dhamkaane ke doshi paae gaye vyaktiyon ke liye sajaa kaa praavdhaan bhi kiya gaya he
 But states have strongly opposed this, which they say violates their rights (law and order is a state subject)
 mumbai ke hamalon ne is prakriya main tatparta kii bhaavana bhar di he
 Therefore, the said format will soon be placed before the cabinet for approval, after which the government will introduce a bill in the upcoming session of Parliament or it can also bring an ordinance related to it
 kuch duusare log chaahate hai ki maujuuda kanoonon ko hi zyada dhardaar banaaya jaae or upie sarkaar kii ore se nirast kiye ja chuke aatankwaad nirodhak kanoon (pota) ke kuch praavdhaanon ko waapas laayaa jaae
 It is true that POTA and its counterparts in Maharashtra can be grossly misused
 khaskar nishane par aae samudaay ke viruddh aisa kiya ja saktaa he
 The dispute is mainly about the provision of closing the suspects for some time - 24 hours under the existing law and several months under the proposed law - and also to confess confessions before the police in the courts
 or not
 kuch log aatankwaad se jude aparaadhon ko rajya kii suchi se hataakar sangheey yaa samavarti suchi main laane kii vakaalat karte hai
 Senior police officials argue that this change in the list of the constitution will bring a tougher law against terrorism, in which more stringent punishments can be given than today, and groups that are trying to violate civil rights violations should not come in the way
 will be given
 aisi sthitiyon se nibatane ke liye jahaan aatankwaadi aparaadhon ke liye maut kii sajaa paae afjal guru jaise vyakti apni sajaa main talavaa lete hai, visheshgy kanoon main sanshodhan kar raham ke praavdhaanon ko hataane kaa suzav dete hai
 The terrorist attacks in Mumbai have also exposed the lamentable condition of the state police units
 uskaa aatankwaad virdohi dasta (aties) jaanch shakha jaisaa hi kaam karata he or uske paas special vepans and tectics (swat) daste sareekhe hamalaa karne vaale daste nahin hai
 The police did not even have the capability to intercept the terrorists before the NSG commando troop arrived, and the panicked state government had to call naval marine commandos for this
 haryana main manesar sthit enesji kii commando tukdi mumbai main chah ghante se bhi adhik deree se pahunchi
 He first had to arrive in trains to reach Delhi airport, because his helicopters could not fly at night
 usne 24 ghante taiyaar khadey maane jate iel-76 vimaan kaa intjaar kiya, jo dur chandigarh main tha
 When the plane landed in Mumbai and the NSG commandos finally boarded the government buses to reach the fighting area, it took more than two days to wipe out the terrorists from the three targets
 uske kuch javaanon ke paas sajo-saamaan kaa bhi ghor abhaav tha
 Except for big things like unmanned military aircraft and moving command posts, its soldiers had to fight without the basic requirements like bulletproof jackets and ballistic helmets
 dilli main udaan bharne se kuch minute pehle blike cat commando phone par dhadadhad anurodh kar rahe the ki unhen hawaii adde par belastic helmet bhej die jaaen
 Jonathan Fighel, Colonel (retired) of the Israel-based International Policy Center for counter-terror, says, "the jawans who raided were not equipped with anti-terrorism specials — clothing, night vision, laser viewfinder, ballistic shield, communication helmets — 
 ''mahanagareey police vyavasthajaahir he, bhartiya mahanagaron ke liye jarurat he ki ve rajdhani ke nikat deraa daalane vaale enesji jaise grih mantralay ke baari-bharkam bal par nirbharta khatm kar den
 It is a system of revolts in Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir during the 1980s
 vishesh rup se prashikshit or vishesh hathiyaaron se las in javaanon kii sankhya 100 se adhik nahin he or aisa bal fire brigade kii tarah desh ke prayek mahanagar main gathit kiye jane kii jarurat he, jo commando karravaayiyon or bandhak bana liye jane kii sthitiyon main hameshaa taiyaar rahe
 It should be formed around the center of the soldiers, who have received special military training and remain vigilant 24 hours
 uske paas atyaadhunik hathiyaar or raat ko dekhne vaale aise upkaran hon jo gherebandi todane or bandhakon ko chhudaane kii sthiti main kargar ho saken
 The government has announced the formation of regional NSG contingents to arrange for emergencies in the short term
 or phir zyaadaatar shaharon ke police bal, aisi apaat sthitiyon kii to baat hi chhodie, saadhaaran aparaadhon se nibatane ke liye bhi aksham hai
 On an average there are 126 policemen per one lakh population
 viksit deshon main yah anupaat prati ek lakh aabaadi par 300 se lekar 500 pulicekarmiyon kaa he
 Ajay Sahni, a counter-terrorism expert and executive director of the Institute for Conflict Management, says, "if you look at the quality of education and training of policemen, the police are not equipped to prevent such terrorist attacks
" 21veen sadi main aapke paas lathi bhaanjane vaali police he
 You are trying to deal with the threat of the 21st century with the 19th century police force
 ''duusare bhi kshetra hai, jinamein tatkaal sudhaar kiye jane kii jarurat he
 Kanwarpal Singh Gill, former Punjab Director General of Police, says, "police stations in high-risk cities should be upgraded to anti-terrorism squads and in the event of a terrorist attack, they are the first ones to deal with them
" shahari aatankwaad se mukaable ke liye unki pratikriya ko is tarah tarateeb di jaae ki ve ek se teen minute ke bich taiyaar ho jaaen
 "and then, as former CBI director Joginder Singh says," The terrorism we face is so intense and equipped with modern weapons to dominate our security system devoid of human resources and technology
 Ability
 akele neuyork shahar main 50,000 close circuit tivi hai, yahaan tak ki ve masjidon main bhi lage hai
 We do not have such closed circuit TV cameras in public places even in the whole country
 ''visheshgyon kaa suzav he ki aatankwaadi hamale chunki desh ke bade mahanagaron main ho sakate hai, isliye bade shaharon kii police vyavastha kii dharna ko apnaane or us par amal karne kii jarurat he
 Such a system in which every city becomes a very safe fort for such policemen who have their own NSG unit, high-quality intelligence system and surveillance equipment
 yani, sankshep main, vah vishwa stareey bal ho
 Clearly, much more remains to be done if India is to deal effectively with the threat of terror
 aise samvedan-sheel rasayanon kii bikri par niyantran ke liye jinhen visphotak banane main istemaal kiya ja sake, kanoon or nigaraanee pranali gathit karne kii jarurat he
 Not only this, an effective agency is also needed to investigate and check illegal sources of money for terrorism
 or jarurat yah bhi he ki suraksha main badi chook hone par vyavastha main zyada javabdehi laai jaae
 Equally important is the development of a counter-terrorist philosophy
 isamen aatankwaadiyon ke khilaaf sainik abhiyaan chalaane ke saath prabhavit ilaakon ke logon ke dil jeetna bhi shaamil he
 To combat terrorism, three important elements must be adopted against it - management of results, counter-terrorism and intelligence
 desh ko tatkaal vyavastha main sudhaaron kii raah pakadani hogi
 Action plan - No mercy on terror; Amending the law to make sure that killers get no mercy
 swadesh kii surakshasmekit kism ke swadesh suraksha vibhaag kii sthapana karnaa
 Bringing stringent laws like the anti-terrorist Legislation, which has a provision to prevent its misuse
 bade shaharon kii police vyavasthapramukh mahanagaron main police kii swatantra kilabandi karnaa

 Another scam is coming to light in Bihar
 mukhyamantri nitish kumaar dwaara shuru kiye gaye mahadalit vikaas yojana main gadabadi kaa khulaasa hua he
 The surveillance department has registered an FIR against 10 people, including three IAS officers associated with the Mahadalit Development Mission

 The monitoring department received a complaint in 2016
 jaanch ke baad nigaraanee vibhaag ne exiaar darj kii he
 The electoral stunt was Nitish's Mahadalit Vikas Yojana: Under the Bihar State Mahadalit Development Mission, there was a plan to provide free training to the Dalit community students under skill development in 16 areas, in which the state government bears the entire cost of training
 training ke liye nijee companiyon kaa chayan kiya gaya tha
 But during the investigation, the monitoring department found disturbances
 ab tak4 karod 25 lakh rupee kii gadabadika maamla saamne aayaa he
 Three IAS officers - the then Principal Secretary of the SC / ST Welfare Department SM Raju, the then Secretary Ravi Manubhai Parmar and the then Chief Executive Director of the Mission KP Ramaiya - were found guilty after being found guilty in the investigation of the surveillance department

 ball tempring ke maamle main pichley saal pratibandh jhelane ke baad ashes siries se test team main vaapasi karne vaale australia ke purv captain steve smith ne aate hi karnama karnaa shuru kar diya
 Not everyone is tired of praising Smith's tremendous performance in the Ashes series
 isi pradarshan ke chalate isisi kii taaja ranking ke mutabik smith test main awwal paaydaan ke ballebaaj ban gaye hai
 Smith has so far 134 in the series
 20 kii ausat se kul 671 ran kuta die hai
 In the three matches played in the series, Smith has scored three centuries and two half-centuries
 chot ke chalate smith teesraa match nahin khel paae the
 This spectacular performance by Smith has put a lock on everyone's face, who questioned him after the ban
 smith ne is siries main kai record tod die hai
 In the Ashes series, Smith holds the record for scoring above 50 runs for the 9th consecutive time
 jiske baad vah aisa karne vaale pehle ballebaaj ban gaye hai
 Not only this, for the third time in a match in the Ashes series, the record of scoring above 250 runs for the third time, there is no player before Smith who has done such a feat in the series played in England
 bhale hi chauthe match main apane shatak se smith chook gaye ho, magar apni team ko siries jitaane main vah nahin chuke
 Smith scored 211 in the first innings and 82 runs in the second innings
 smith ek aise khilaadi hai jo apni team ko jarurat padane par har samay saath khadey rahete hai
 Smith has performed whenever the team needed
 isi ke saath hi smith ek ore record ke najadik aa gaye hai
 This is the third time Smith has touched 600 in the Test series
 isse pehle don breadman lagaataar 6 siries main 600 se zyada ran bana chuke hai
 Looking at Smith's current form, it looks like he will break Bradman's record
 agar wo aisa karte hai to smith kaa cricket ke itihaas main naam hameshaa ke liye darj ho jayega
 Ponting to break Ponting's record: Ricky Ponting, one of Australia's most successful captains, has several records
 shandaar pradarshan ke chalate smith ne ponting ke ek record kii barabari kar lee he
 Ponting had scored a century in the first innings of a Test match 10 times and a half-century in the second innings
 ashes siries ke chauthe test match main smith ne pehali pari main shatak or duusari pari main ardhashatak lagaakar ponting ke is record kii barabari hasil kar lee he
 Now if Smith hits a century in the first innings and a half-century in the second innings in the upcoming Test match, he will break this record of Ponting
 yah baat alag he ki dakshin africa ke purv olerounder jaik kalis ne lagaataar 11 test main pehali pari main shatak or duusari pari main ardhashatak banaaya tha
 Looking at all these records, Smith is seen to be surpassing Virat Kohli, who is considered to be the world's number one batsman to date
 ashes siries kaa ek match abhi baaki he, jo 12 sitambar se khelaa janaa he
 Obviously, people whose heart thwarts in the name of cricket will have their eyes on Smith's bat
 ummid kerani chahie ki smith kaa balla ek baar phir se bolegaa

 For whom would Gulzar write these lines? For his beloved Rakhi or for those lovers of his poetry who sprinkle heart upon him
 haath chhuten bhi to rishte nahin choda kartewaqt kii shaakh se lamhe nahin todaa kartebhala koun bhul saktaa he gulzaar ko, unki rachanaaon ko
 Omar Khayyam's rubies are his compositions
 hindi shaayari, ghazal or geeton ke is nayab heere kii aaj janmatithi he
 Gulzar saheb has used such wonderful sensations with words in his poetry and songs
 kitni lunai he, unamem
 More than one miss, more than one song, what a great ghazal, what a great shayari
 
 
 vaqt rahata nahin kahin tik karadat is kii bhi aadmi si he***tumhaari kushk si ankhen bhalee nahin lagatinvo sari chizein jo tum ko rulaayen, bheji hai***jis kii aankhon main kati thim sadiyanus ne sadiyon kii judaai di he***koi yon bhi, itnaa umdaa bhi kyon likhata he bhala? mechainic sampurna singh kalra se geetkaar bane gulzaar aaj kii taarikh main karodon dilon par raaj karte hai
 He was born on 18 August 1934 in the Sikh family of Dina, a small town in the Jhelum district of Punjab
 yah hissaa ab pakistan main he
 Gulzar saheb had a fondness for chero-poetry and music since his school days
 college ke dinon main unhone apane shauk ko hawa di
 When the partition took place, the family moved to Amritsar, and later Gulzar saheb took refuge in Mumbai
 gulzaar ne sine kariyar kii shuruyaat 1961 main vimal raay ke sahaayak ke rup main kii
 Later he also worked as an assistant to Hrishikesh Mukherjee and Hemant Kumar
 geetkaar ke rup main gulzaar ne pehla gaanaa 'mora gora ang lei le' saal 1963 main pradarshit vimal raay kii film 'bandini' ke liye likhaa
 What a hit that song was
 
 From that time till today
 unhone jo bhi kiya, itihaas bana diya
 In the year 1971, through the film 'mere Apne', he also ventured into the field of direction
 lekhak yatindra mishra ne gulzaar sahab ko badhai dete hue likhaa, "behtareen afasananigaar, sadabahaar geetkaar or samvedansheel filmkaar kaa umr ke 85wein vasant main pravesh ke vaqt, unke geeton kii samvednaa or ravaani ke saath kheramaqadam he
 For a hundred years, the world of such songs, music, poetry and nazams would remain inhabited
 "vaaki soshal media pej par aaj gulzaar sahab ko badhai dene waalon kaa tantaa laga he
 Prashant Dwivedi has expressed his feelings in a few words, "these are those who are ashaar with honey, their name is Gulzar
 
 
 gulzaar sahib kaa naam sunate hi hont jaise kisi chaashni main dub jate hai
 Their words and ash'ar also add honey to the sand particles
 wo us jamaat ke shaayar tehre jinke kudarti ishq ke lafzon ke zarie insaan kii har kaifiyat bayaan kii ja sakati he
 "he is excellent in both literature and cinema
 unke likhe kaa falak to dekhie- 'hamane dekhi he un ankhon kii mahakati khushboo, haath se chhukar ise rishton ke ilzaam na do' se lekar 'dil to baccha he ji' tak
 "his tone of writing every feeling is very soft and velvety, full of wonder and humor
 unke yome paidaaish par kuch rob gaalib karnaa to banataa hi he
 Such as, that by writing love, his pen gets the destination, and that ink becomes ink
 aaj bas itani si dua he ki hamaara or unka saath lanbaa rahe
 One more year
 saal-dar-saal tak aise hi
 
 
 
 or
 
 
 His Omar passed in writing, my Omar passed away in reading
 
 
 "vaaki gulzaar ne hindi ko, hindi cinema ko kitna kuch nawaja
 Not only did he write, but 'koshish', 'intro', 'mere Apne', 'sudden', 'khushbu', 'gale', 'mausam', 'kinara', 'mira', 'kitab', 'namkeen' He also thundered Hindi cinema by directing several films like ', Angoor', 'mujjat', 'veneer', 'but', 'maachis' and 'who Tu Tu'
 gulzaar sahab kii pramukh prakashit kritiyon main pukhraj, ek boond chaand, chauras raat, ravi paar, kuch or nazmen, yaar julahe, triveni , chainya-chainya, meraa kuch saamaan shaamil he
 Gulzar developed a new style of poetry, called 'triveni'
 'ham ko man kii shakti dena daata, man vijay karen' or 'jangal-jangal baat chali pataa chalaa he, chaddhi pahan ke phool khilaa he phool khilaa he' jaise geeton se unhone har jamaane ke bacchon ko prerana dene yaa phir thiraka dene kii jaise thaan si lee he
 Gulzar's presence in Bal Geet is enough to convey the versatility
 gulzaar kii kaabiliat yon kisi aword kii muhtaaj nahin, par unhone bees baar filmphere or paanch baar rashtriya puraskaar jeeta he
 In 2010, he was also awarded the Grammy Award for the song 'jai Ho' of 'slumdog Millionaire'
 bhartiya cinema main unke yogadan ko dekhte hue saal 2004 main unhen desh ke tisare bade naagarik sammaan padmabhushan se alankrita kiya gaya, to cinema jagat main ullekhneey yogadan ke liye gulzaar sahab ko film industry ke sarvocch sammaan dada sahab phalke se bhi sammanit kiya gaya he

 Love does not resonate on the sound of a body, there is no temple arti, nor worship is love, nor is greed, there is no gain, no loss, no love, no favor, no favor

 lekin vaastaviktaa unki apeksha ke anuroop krantikari nahin thi
 When Mahatma Gandhi was using nonviolence to see this struggle as a just struggle for the Ram Rajya, at the same time the message of nationalism was reaching among the people in different ways
 yah keval kiski swatantraaa kaa sawaal nahin tha, balki kisi swatantraaa kaa bhi sawaal tha
 In the public eye, Mahatma Gandhi was such a saint who was mixing political leadership with moral force

 At the same time, the real struggle for independence was being seen as a war of liberation from thousands of years of slavery to Bharat Mata
 rashtravaadi andolan kii kalpana—'vande maataram' se lekar bharat mata or go-mata ko aapas main jode jane tak—spasht rup se hindu tha
 This was from the beginning of the twentieth century when Aurobindo equated nationalism with Sanatana Dharma and Lokmanya Tilak joined Ganesha and Shivaji celebrations together and turned them into platforms of self-government
 itihaaskaar wiliam guld ne 1930 or 1940 ke dashak main rashtravaadi abhiyaanon ke adhyayan main likhaa he, ''dharm jaruri dhaanche, sthaan, anushaasan taiyaar karne tathaa lamaband karne main madad karata tha or isi prakriya main 'hindutv' kaa rajnatik arth parishkrut hota hua ek vichaar ke rup main viksit hua
 
 
 Hindu people were offered as a symbol of the Indian nation
 ''isse yah nahin ingit hota ki bharat ko hinduon kii bhoomi ke rup main—yaa jinaki aajkal bharatvanshi dharmon ke rup vyakhya kii jaati he—dekha jaataa tha
 This meant that at the national level, in general, Indian was essentially Hindu in a very loose sense and mainly in the cultural sense

 Contemporary 'secular' scholars have tried to show that the Ayodhya movement began with the Lok Sabha elections of 2014 and 2019, to some extent, the outspoken Hindu mobilization that shaped India's rise as an independent country ' Is completely different and unrelated to the idea of india

 The first of these misconceptions is that the conditions of India's post-independence discourse are as if it were a stone line that included both 'scientific thinking' and constitutional consensus

 vyavhaar main iskaa taatpary tha ki bhartiya sabhyataa kii viraasat dikhaawati baton ke liye bhale mahatvapurn ho, lekin aadhunik bharat ke nirmaan main vah dwitiyak thi
 Large dams and modern steel factories were the 'temples' of modern India for Nehru, while old temples of religious beliefs gave rise to irrationalism, superstition and regressive beliefs
 nehruwadiyon ke liye sweekaarya hindu dharm gudh aadhyatmavaad or ucch darshan tha; anushthanon or jati-nirdhaarit reeti-rivaajon par aadhaarit jeevant hindu aasthaa kaa aadhunik bharat ke saarvajanik jivan main koi sthaan nahin tha
 In fact, faith based on rituals and customs was considered to be a hindrance to progress
 isi ke saath judaa hua ek anya vishwaas tha jo baad main 'sanvaidhanik deshbhakti' ke rup main janaa gaya
 This concept, largely based on post-world War German thought, defines nationality in the context of the Constitution
 isamen, saarvajanik jivan kaa sanchaalan karne vaale niyamon ko paribhaashit karne ke bajaae samvidhan ko raashtra kaa darshan mana jaataa he
 In some strange way, the year 1950 became the 'zero Year' of India, from there, it was considered a new beginning of the Indian system
 samvidhan ke astitv main aane se pehle ke bhartiya raashtra ko abhilekhaagaar main daal dene kii apeksha karte hue or ateet ke saath keval maheen-si kadi jodate hue ek aadhunik bharat ke nirmaan kii kalpana kii gai
 The second belief is that there was a sense of hatred towards Hindu majoritarianism before Modi-era
 iskaa matlab tha ki vishesh rup se raajnneeti main hindu bhaawanaaon ko kadai se niyantran main rakhaa janaa he, alabatta jati, varg or kshetra jaisi vividh pahachaanon ke aadhaar par kiye jane vaale kaaryon tathaa dharmanirpekshata ke darshan kii raksha kerani he
 But the secularism that developed in India was very different
 dharmik alpsankhyakon ko di gai sanvaidhanik guarantee ke prati andhashraddha dikhaai gai
 Nehru's official biographer S
 gopal ke anusaar, ''nehru kii mulya pranali main alpsankhyakon kii samasyaon se nipatane kaa daayitv mul rup se bahusankhyak samudaay par tha
 Its success was not to be judged by what Hindus think, but rather by how Muslims and other communities feel
 
 
 '' pradhanmantri ke rup main manmohan singh ne isi siddhant ko or adhik parishkrut karte hue kaha tha ki rajya ke sansadhano par 'pehla haq' musalamaanon kaa he
 Since the mid-1980s, India has been witnessing the development of alternative nationalism based on a clear rejection of these two pillars of Congress consensus
 bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) kaa teji se vikaas 1989 main shuru hua, lekin yah narendra modi ke netritv main hi hua ki party 2014 or 2019 ke chunaavon main loksabhaa main apane dam par bahumat hasil karte hue aadhipaty kii sthiti main pahunch gai
 The nationalist challenge that Narendra Modi has presented against the principles of the Congress consensus of the past certainly has a relation with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak sangh-bjp's traditional Hindu nationalism
 isaki sthaayee prishthbhumi he—bharat kii pavitrataa ko nirupit karne vaala bharat mata kaa aahvaan or hindu aadhaaron vaale saanskrithik rashtrawaad ko rashtriya ekta kaa samanaarthi bananaa
 Equally important is the belief that a strong state should have strong patriotic communities that are bound by strong family values and values, and are proactive
 rashtriya swayamsevak sangh or bhaajapa ke liye rashtrawaad kaa arth he, vah baat mukhar hokar kehane kii kshamta jise dinadayal upaadhyaay ne 'bhartiya chiti' ke rup main bataaya he, or jise mote taur par bharat kii aatma kaha ja saktaa he
 Its Hindutva is cultural and different from that of codified political Hindutva, which was advocated by V

 Savarkar did it
 narendra modi apane paristhitik tantra ke utpaada the, lekin ve vahiin nahin ruke
 On the lines of the idea that Swami Vivekananda espoused at the end of the 19th century, Narendra Modi has advanced the appeal of nationalism
 sabase pehle to unhone rashtrawaad ko 'daridr narayan' ke saath aise kalyankari kaaryakramon ke madhyam se joda jinka makasad sabhi garibon ko kuch-na-kuch dena he—chaahe vah ghar banane ke liye nakad sahaayta ho, svachh rasoi gas ho, har ghar ke liye shauchalay ho, sabhi gaanvon main bijli kaa conection ho yaa abhi haal main ghoshit har ghar tak pine kaa pani pahunchane kii yojana ho
 More important, they have tried to implement this welfare mission with efficiency and financial integrity
 ve bhrashtachar ko raashtra ke viruddh aparaadh ke rup main sthapit karne main safal rahe hai
 With this attitude, Narendra Modi has undeniably adopted a modernist and technical approach
 nehru ke paas bhi aisa hi drushtipath tha, lekin narendra modi ise abhijaat varg se aage le jate hue lokapriy aakankshaon se jod sake hai
 At the same time, just as Vivekananda tried to increase Hindu pride by reaching the west, Narendra Modi has tried to present India as a proud but responsible global power
 isse bharat kii vaishvik chhavi jitani upar uthi he, utana hi gharelu morche par bharat ke aatm-samaan main badhotaree hui he
 Narendra Modi has brought Indian nationalism into the 21st century
 unhone swatantraaa sangram or samakaleen aakankshaon ke bich sethu kaa nirmaan kiya he
 The soul of India, which once took pride in 'charkha', is now proud in the lunar campaign

 Modi will take part in two public events here
 abu dhabi main vah bhartiya kamgaaron or dubai main bharatiyon ko sambodhit karenge

 With these things, Modi can also try to present a religiously liberal image of himself on this tour
 isamen sabase ahm abu dhabi kii mashhoorsheekh jaaed masjid main unka dauraarhegaa
 Modi has refused to wear the hat of Muslim religion on a public platform in India and has also received considerable criticism for it

 Music systems were installed
 baad main ye tarika kai khilaadiyon ne apana liya
 He came in and sat next to me and the conversation started
 phir to silsilaa shuru ho gaya
 How was your experience as an administrator with Sachin? He opens up with a lot of people
 kam ke saath dosti karte hai
 Maintain a very low profile
 chote khilaadiyon main shuruyaat main dar rahata he sachin ko lekar
 But Sachin mixes with simplicity
 sachin sabase pehle fahrren tour main junior ladakon ko dinar par le jate hai
 This opens the boys
 sachin khud apana aura todakar mixp hote hai
 Also i have not seen such a focused player till date
 match ke ek do din pehle vah logon se milanaa julna band kar dete hai
 Don't even stay on the phone
 match ke baad baat karo
 There are no distractions before the match
 vah kehete hai ki jisane game ke saath dhokhaa diya, vah kabhi nahin chale
 i am not personally speaking on behalf of the BCCI
 meri ichha thi ki vah 25 saal khelte
 We met in Jaipur
 hotel main baat hui
 So i said that you should play till the New Zealand tour
 main chahta tha ki vah itnaa to khele hai
 Sachin said that i have not decided anything yet
 lekin jab aayega, apane aap hi aayega
 i will feel seated sitting one evening that i should do it now
 maine kaha, are aise to nahin hota he, plan karnaa chahie
 He said that it does not happen to me

 He was playing in Dhaka
 maine sachin ko phone kiya
 Told
 vah bole ki main parivaar se baat karata hum
 i felt that 10 percent work was done

 Then the other day i got a call that my family is against this idea
 maine sonia ji ko bataaya
 Number them, then talk
 ye president kii taraf se hota he
 The government recalls
 sarkaar ne naam diya or phir vah sansad sadsy ban gaye
 What are Sachin doing on the demand of Bharat Ratna? It has been going on for two to three years

 Reached near target saurav ne kaha ki puri team tishart ko utaaregi, or phir jo hua aapane dekha, phir ek baar match ke baad pataa chalaa ki sehvaag ko jon rhite ne thappad maar diya
 Hearing this, the atmosphere of the entire team deteriorated
 saurav ne kaha ki jon ko aakar maafee maangani hogi
 i said let's talk
 jon baahar cigarette pi rahe the
 He told that i vented angrily on him like a guru
 thappad nahin maaraa
 Just pushed because he made the same mistake again
 har baar kii tarah out ho gaya tha
 i came and told that brother John is saying this, venting anger like a guru
 saurav ad gaye ki nahin nahin maafee to maangani hogi
 Sachin took me to the edge and said that whatever happens, Wright should not apologize
 main salaah samaj gaya
 If the coach apologizes then what will he do next? maine viru ko samajhaayaa
 He himself said, no, John will not apologize
 mudda khatam ho gaya
 i said, i will apologize after bringing it into the room
 dressing room main maafee kii baat khatm ho gai
 After arriving at the hotel, Veeru said that not even in the room, no apology, it would be an embarrassment
 phir phone par hi donon kii baat ho gai
 The special thing about this incident was that there was so much media, no one was exposed to it
 chaar saal baad rahul dravid ne kisi function main yah baat boli, tab baahar ai

 Sachin told me that you did it yourself, denied the news
 sachin ne bataaya ki maine apane pita ko teen vachan die the
 i will never drink alcohol kabhi cigarette nahin piunga or kabhi raajnneeti main nahin aauungaa
 So this is one for all
 mujhe nahin lagata ki ve kabhi political party jwine karenge
 Remember your biggest thing related to Sachin
 sachin sangharshon se upar uthe
 He did not forget his old days
 mujhe unhone bataaya
 Lived in Kala Nagar

 There was only one problem
 fielding ke vakt jab jeb main haath jaataa tha
 So the pockets were wet
 ve jaldi nahin suukh paati thim
 He remembers all this even today
 ye badi cheez he
 The other thing is not a lot of ambition

 There is no threat to their existence
 unhone congress netaa anand sharma par aarope lagaaya ki unhone is vidheyak ke virodh main kai aise tark die hai, jinka mul se sambandh nahin he
 The only basis of this bill is that those who have been tortured religiously in Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan, will be given citizenship on taking refuge in India

 He said that this bill is not affecting the right to equality under Article 14 of the Constitution in any way
 unhone kaha ki logon ko indore, kuccha yaa pashchim bengal main aise sharnaarthiyon ke halaat jaakar dekhnaa chahie
 If the circumstances of such people are seen, then the person will seal this bill immediately

 ''jaishankar ne kaha ki yah vaastivaktaa he

 Priyanka Sharma is the second wildcard entry

 Usually, where the commoners included in the members of the house are being given 25 thousand to 50 thousand rupees, as a commoner, the package of worship taking entry into the house is being told more than Hina

 In protest against the terrorist attack on the bus of Amarnath Yatris in Kashmir on Monday, Bajrang Dal activists on Wednesday slapped a mango trader for not saying 'bharat Mata ki Jai' in Haryana's Hisar
 is ghatana ke baad se hi ilaake main tanaav pasra hua he
 Love for our country is in everyone's mind: This whole matter, Minister of State for Home Affairs, Hansraj Ahir said that the Center is monitoring the matter
 hisar maamle par 'aaj tak' se baatcheet main hansraj ahir ne kaha, 'desh main jo janm lete hai, unamem bharat mata ke liye prem janm se hota he
 It may be said to someone forcibly that now say, now say Bharat Mata ki Jai, this is not right kanoon ko koi bhi haath main nahin le saktaa he
 'it is wrong to force someone to force slogans,' he said, it is not right for anyone to force slogans
 ham bhi desh bhakt hai par iskaa matlab ye nahin ki kisi se jabardastee 'bharat mata kii jai' kaa naaraa lagava lenge
 There is no need to ask for a report from the state government
 vahaan kii police kaam kar rahi he
 The law should do its work in this matter
 aatankwaad kaa putala foonkane nikle the kaaryakartaapako bataa den ki buudhvaar cobjrang daljila pramukh ke netritv main pradarshnkaree shahar ke lahoria chowk par aatankwaadi hamale ke khilaaf jamkar narebaaji karte hue putala jala rahe the
 It is being said that the Bajrang Dal activists had to first burn the effigy of Parijat Chowk, but suddenly reached the effigy outside the religious place near Lahoria Chowk
 vyapaaree ko jadaa thappadaisi dauraan sabji mandi main aam bechney ke baad saharanpur ke kuch vyapaaree vahaan pahunch gaye
 At that time Bajrang Dal activists were shouting 'bharat Mata Ki Jai'
 pradarshnakariyon main shaamil kuch logon ne un vyapaariyon se bharat mata kii jai bolne ko kaha
 Failing to do so, the protesters slapped the common trader
 iske baad donon pakshon main jamkar kahasuni bhi hui, jiske baad se hi ilaake main tanaav bana he

 kya aapse kabhi kisi ne ye kaha he ki pani pinaa nuksaandeh ho saktaa he? ji haa, shaayad aapako pataa na ho lekin bahut adhik pani pinaa bhi nuksaandeh ho saktaa he
 According to one study, there is no scientific basis for how many glasses of water a person should drink
 jo log aath yaa das gilaas pani pine kii baat kehete hai, wo mahaj andaaje par ye baat kehete hai
 The amount of water a person should drink depends entirely on the environment of the place, age of the person, sex and fitness
 pani kii kami or adhikta donon hi he khatarnakapani kii kami or adhikta donon hi sehat ke liye khatarnaak he
 Lack of water increases the risk of de-hydration, while the person drinking too much water complains of overhydration
 is samasya se sabase adhik athlete prabhavit hote hai
 On the one hand, due to lack of water, there is cramp in their muscles and on the other hand, drinking too much water reduces their blood viscosity
 visheshgyon kii maane pani utana hi pinaa chahie jitne se pyaas bujh jaae
 Do not force water if you are not thirsty
 bahut adhik pani pi lene se chakkar aane lagate hai or vyakti asahaj mahasoos karne lagata he
 Sometimes the heartbeat also becomes faster
 par iskaa matlab ye bilkul nahin he ki kam pani pinaa chahie
 Whatever liquid we take except alcohol, there is some amount of water in it
 pyaas lagane kaa matlab sharir main pani kii kami ho gai he
 Thirst is good for health
 pani tabhi pien jab aapako isaki jarurat mahasoos ho
 It is not right to forcefully drink water
 sharir main pani kii maatra bani rahani chahie lekin zyada nahin
 The lack of water in the body is also known by the color of urin
 agar aapke ureen kaa rang gaharaa he to iskaa sidhaa matlab he ki aapke sharir main pani kii kami he
 But to cure it, drinking a lot of water is not right
 ureen kaa halkaa pilaa hona saamaanya baat he

 Sushant and Kriti took a break from their relationship! This is the reason that Ranbir's name has been stamped in a way after the name of Sushant Singh Rajput was removed from this film
 kyonki akshay ko film se pehle hi hataaya ja chukaa he or ab sushant kaa naam bhi isse peeche le liya gaya he
 Apart from this, there is only one actor who was involved in this race, and that is actor Ranbir Kapoor
 to kya darshak ranbir ko duusari baar ek byopic film main dekhne ja rahe hai? iskaa khulaasa vakt ke saath ho jayega
 Sushant, who made a mistake in Dushyant's poem, has drawn the word that the shooting of the film will start next year and it can be released by Christmas 2019
 shuru main akshay ko is film ke liye ofer kiya gaya tha lekin baad main kuch chizon ke chalate vah isse alag ho gaye
 The film is a biopic of Gulshan Kumar and will feature all the ups and downs of his life
 aarope he ki di-company ke gurgon ne gulshan kumaar kii hatya kar di thi
 Do your hair also appear in the bird's nest a few hours after shampooing? It often happens that after shampooing for some time, the hair looks soft and unkempt, but as it dries, they start to look dry
 haalanki baalo kii is uljhan ke liye zyaadaatar hair exparts condishnar yuj karne kii salaah dete hai lekin lambey samay tak condishnar ke istemaal se bal kharaab hone kaa dar rahata he
 In such a situation, if you wish, you can get rid of this mess of hair by adopting these home remedies
 1
 After shampooing apple cider vinegar or onion juice, apply onion juice to your hair and leave it for a while
 iske baad baalo ko acchhee tarah dho len taaki pyaaj kii gandh dur ho jaae
 If you do not like the smell of onion, you can also use apple cider vinegar
 do chammach vinegar ko ek litre pani main mila len
 After shampoo, wash your hair with it
 in donon hi upayon se baalo main chamak to aegi hi saath hi baalo main ruukhaapanabhi nahin rah jayega
 2
 andey kaa istemaal bhi rahegaa phydemandjyaadaatar logon ko pataa hi nahin hota he ki anda ek behtareen condishnar he
 Separate the egg white and the yellow part
 safed bhaag main jaitoon kaa tel milakar lagane se baalo kii uljhan dur ho jaaegi or baalo kii chamak bhi bani rahegi
 3
 tauliye kaa sahi istemaal karenshampoo ke baad baalo ko tauliye se ragadkar sukhaane ke bajaay, halke haathon se dabaa-dabaakar sukhaaen
 Wet hair is very weak
 aise main unke tuutane kii ashanka bahut zyada hoti he
 Apart from this, whenever you come out in the sun, leave the hair covered so that the hair gets less tangled and the effect of dust and smoke is reduced on them
