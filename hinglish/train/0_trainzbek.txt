 Even in modern life many people feel that women are made only for household work
 aapke partner kii bhi agar aisi soch he to rishte ko aage badhaane se pehle apanepartnerase khulkar is mudde par baat karen

 england ke khilaaf southampton main khele gaye chauthe test match mentim indiyake ballebaajon kaa lachar pradarshan use le duba
 In Southampton, Team India sat out this match and series by 60 runs on the fourth day
 moin ali kii aguwai menenglandke gendbaajon ke shandaar pradarshan ke dam par mejabaan team ne viraat kohli or ajinkya rahane ke ardhashtakon ke baavjood bharat ko haraakar paanch maichon kii siries main 3-1 kii vijayi badhat bana lee
 India lost their last seven wickets by adding just 61 runs
 is match main ek vakt team india kaa palada baari tha, lekin 20 saal kesam kurenek baar phir team india kii jeet kii raah main diwaar banakar khadey rahe or ahm maukon par england ke liye upyogi sabit hue
 Sam Buren proved to be a major headache for Team India after Southampton's No
 1 Birmingham Test at Southampton also after Birmingham
 sam kuren ne is match main kul 124 ran banaae or 2 wicket bhi jatke, jisamen pehali pari main viraat kohli kaa ahm wicket bhi shaamil tha
 When England's score was 6 for 86 in the first innings, it was Curren who played a valuable innings of 78 runs to take England's score to 246
 iske baad kuren ne gend se bhi kamaal dikhaate hue pehali pari main captain viraat kohli kaa wicket liya jo team india ko majboot badhat kii ore le ja sakate the
 When Kohli was out, India's score was 2 wickets for 142 runs, India lost the opportunity to take a big lead in the first innings as soon as Kohli was out
 pehali pari main kohli ke out hone ke baad bharat sirf 131 ran hi jod paaya
 Which gave him a slight lead of 27 runs which proved insufficient
 vahiin agar pujaara ne 132 ran nahin banaae hote to bharat kii haalat or bhi kharaab ho sakati thi
 In the second innings, the wounds were given in the second innings as well, Sam Curren gave pain to Team India
 unhone 46 ranon kii upyogi pari khelkar england kii badhat ko 233 tak pahunchaaya jo shaayad 200 se kam ho sakati thi
 Curren shared a 55-run partnership with Jose Butler for the seventh wicket
 iske baad aathven wicket ke liye adil raashid ke saath apni team ke liye 27 ran jode
 In this way, he committed his life to get India out of the match
 kuren ran banaate rahe, lekin viraat brigade ke paas unka koi tod nahin tha
 If England have managed to win this series, then Sam Curren contributed a lot to it
 saath hi unhone 'main of da siries' ke liye apni daavedaari bhi pesh kii he

 After this, the team of 'aaj Tak' went to SP Shivraj Meena but they refused to arrest anyone and said that investigation is still on

 Responding to media queries, Captain Amarinder said "there should be some discipline"
 captain ne kaha ki unke mantrimandal main 17 log the jisamen unhone siddhu sahit 13 ke vibhaag badale the
 The CM of Punjab said that Sidhu's resignation has been received and when he goes to Punjab from Delhi, he will see Sidhu's resignation

 He further added, some discipline is also required

 But his resignation was sent to Rahul Gandhi, which was dated on 10 June
 iske baad unke istife par sawaal uthne lage
 At the same time, a statement was also issued by the Punjab Chief Minister's Office that Sidhu's resignation has not been received yet
 iske baad siddu kii ore se bhi bayaan jari kiya gaya ki vah punjab ke siem ko apana istipha bhej rahe hai or somvaar ko phir unhone twitor par jaankaree di ki unka istipha punjab mukhyamantri karyaalay ko mil gaya he
 With Navjot Singh Sidhu joining the Congress, he had reached 36 with Captain Amarinder
 captain unako punjab kii raajnneeti se dur rakhana chaahate the yahaan tak ki vah unako mantrimandal main bhi nahin rakhana chaahate the lekin siddhu ke upar us samay congress alaakaman meharbaan tha or unki har baat maani ja rahi thi
 Even Sidhu, unlike Captain Amarinder Singh, went to Pakistan to attend Imran's swearing-in ceremony
 lekin loksabhaa chunaav ke baad halaat badal gaye or captain amarinder singh ne mantrimandal main pherbadal kar siddhu se unka vibhaag chin liya
 Even an investigation has been started by Punjab ACB
 vibhaag chhinane se naaraaz siddhu ne mantralay main jaakar kaamkaaj bhi nahin sambhala
 On this, BJP leader Tarun Chugh wrote a letter to the governor complaining that he has taken the oath of ministerial position but has not yet taken charge, yet he is enjoying the salary and allowances as a minister

 Narendra Modi's cabinet consists of 2 former Indian Foreign Service (IFS) officers
 purv videsh sachiv es jaishankar or hardip singh puri ye do purv iesces afasar hai
 The special thing between the two officers is that Hardeep Singh Puri was a senior of s Jaishankar while in the Foreign Service
 haalanki ab es jaishankar modi mantrimandal main hardip singh puri ke 'senior' ho gaye hai
 Former foreign secretary s Jaishankar was the most shocking name in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's second term cabinet
 vah pehali baar mantri bane or vah bhi kendriya mantri
 He has been given the charge of the Ministry of External Affairs
 jaishankar bhartiya videsh seva ke adhikari rahe hai or unki ginati desh ke kaamyaab rajanyikon main hoti he
 Now he has replaced Sushma Swaraj as the new foreign minister of the country
 modi ke cabinet main bhartiya videsh seva iesces ke 2 afasar shaamil kiye gaye to bhartiya prashasnic seva se 2 afasaron aarake singh or som prakaash ko mantri banaaya gaya he
 RK Singh is a 1975 batch IAS officer
 vahiin purv iees som prakaash bhi mantri (rajya mantri) banaae gaye hai
 Apart from Jaishankar, there is another Indian Foreign Service officer who was inducted into the Modi cabinet and his name is Hardeep Puri
 haalanki hardip puri narendra modi ke pehle kaarykaal ke dauraan bhi mantrimandal kaa hissaa rahe the
 RK Singh is a 1975 batch IAS officer and has been made a minister for the second time
 puri ko shahari vikaas mantri (swatantra prabhaar) banaaya gaya he
 While RK Singh has been made the Minister of Power (independent Charge)
 pehle senior ab juniorhardip puri 1974 batch ke iesces afasar hai jabaki subramanyam jaishankar 3 saal baad iesces bane or vah 1977 batch ke hai
 Hardeep Puri is 3 years senior to Jaishankar, but now he is junior to Jaishankar in Modi cabinet
 janvari, 2014 main bhartiya janata party (bijepi) main shaamil hone vaale hardip singh puri ko 2 sitambar, 2017 ko modi mantrimandal main shaamil kiya gaya or unhen shahari vikaas rajya mantri (swatantra prabhaar) banaaya gaya
 This time he also tried his luck from the Amritsar parliamentary seat, but lost in the election
 haalanki haar ke baad bhi unhen mantri banaaya gaya he
 On the other hand, s Jaishankar, who won a place in the Union Cabinet without contesting elections, was a special part of Narendra Modi's team
 vah 2015 se 2018 tak videsh sachiv rahe
 His appointment was highly disputed
 tatkaaleen videsh sachiv sujatha singh ko ritairement se 9 maheene pehle hi hataakar jaishankar ko videsh sachiv bana diya gaya tha
 Jaishankar, a successful diplomat, is a representative of India in talks with China and the United States
 desh ke pramukh samrik vishleshkon main se ek divangat ke
 Subramanian's son Jaishankar was a key member of the Indian team negotiating for the historic indo-us nuclear deal
 jaishankar america or china jaise ahm deshon main bhartiya rajdoot ke pad par kaam kar chuke hai
 Jaishankar, a 1977 batch IFS, played a key role in resolving the crisis with China after the Depsang and Doklam disputes in Ladakh
 vah singapore main bharat ke ucchayukta or check ganraajya main rajdoot padon par bhi kaam kar chuke hai
 It remains to be seen how much Jaishankar can succeed as a foreign minister, while Hardeep Singh Puri has become a minister for the second time

 There have been many indications in Maharashtra politics with this election
 inamen ek behad mahatvapurn sanket yah he ki vahaan kii raajnneeti main manase ke pramukh raaj thakare kaa raajnneetik prabhaav kaaphi kam ho gaya he
 In the last assembly elections, he was very much discussed
 jaankaron kaa kahana he ki raaj thakare ne is baar loksabhaa chunaav ke thik pehle narendra modi ke samarthan main ek bhi seat par nahin khadey hone kaa jo faisla kiya, vah unhen mahangaa padaa
 This confused his party workers and he kept quiet
 isliye jab vah vidhansabha chunaav main khadey hue to unhen janata kaa koi khaas samarthan nahin mila
 He also did not have any major issues
 darasal pehle to vah marathi-gaiyr marathi ke jhagade ko bhunaakar raajnneeti karte the

 He did raise the issue of toll tax during this period, but that did not mean much to the people of the entire state
 jaankaron kaa kahana he ki raaj thakare kii jivan style bhi badal gai or ve aramtalab ho gaye the
 He did not give any new direction to his party from which he could move forward
 ab taaja sthiti yah he ki manase mahaj 4 siton par jeet paaegi
 This does not prove anything
 vah is sthiti main nahin hai ki moltol kar saken yaa kuch ofer kar saken

 In the worship of any deity, the resolution is first
 puja vidhi kaa ye bhi ek anivaary ang he
 According to astrologers, if worshiped with the right method, then its fruit is obtained very soon
 isiilie jab bhi vishesh pujan kiya jaataa he tab kisi brahman kii madad lee jaati he
 So that worship can be done by law
 puja main dhyaan rakhane yogya baaten-puja main deepak, shivlinga, shaligram jameen par naa rakhen-mani, devi-devataaon kii murtiyon, yagyopavit or shankh jameen par kabhi naa rakhen-in chizon ko kabhi bhi sidhe jameen par nahin rakhana chahie
 - It is best to place a cloth or keep these things in a high place
 subah uthte hi dhyaan rakhen ye baaten-subah uthte hi ishtdev kaa dhyaan karen-apni donon hatheliyon ko dekhnaa chahie
 After this, one should not remain bathed for long
 -raat main pahane hue kapadon ko sheeghra tyaag dena chahie
 Complete the resolution of donation on the due date, then the resolution should be fulfilled under any circumstances on the fixed date
 -daan dene main agar ek din kaa vilamb hota he to duguna daan dena chahie
 -if there is a delay of one month, the donation becomes fourfold
 -do maah bitne par daan kii raashi sahastraguni yani hajaar guna ho jaati he
 Whenever you resolve to donate, you should donate on the due date
 -akaaran daan dene main vilamb nahin karnaa chahie
 Importance of Parikrama - Always start the circumambulation of the idol of the Lord and the temple from the right hand side - the positive energy present in the idols flows from north to south
 -baayen haath kii ore se parikrama karne par sakaaratmak urja se sharir kaa takaraav hota he-is vajah se parikrama kaa laabh nahin mil paata he, daahine kaa arth dakshin bhi hota he-is kaaran se parikrama ko pradakshina bhi kaha jaataa hysury dev kii saat, shriganesh kii chaar parikrama karen-bhagwaan vishnu or unke sabhi avtaron kii chaar,parikrama karendevi durga kii ek, hanumanji kii teen,-shivaji kii aadhi pradakshina karne kaa niyam he
 The meaning of taking resolution is to preside over the presiding deity and self-witnessing - taking a pledge that the worship deeds are doing for the fulfillment of various desires - taking a pledge that they will complete this worship
 sankalp lete samay karen shri ganesh kaa dhyaan-sankalp lete samay haath main jal liya jaataa he-kyonki is puri sristi ke panchmahabhuton yani agri, prithvi, akaash, vaayu or jal main
 
 
 Lord Ganpati is the ruler of the water element
 -isiilie shriganesh ke sankalp liya jaataa he
 -for the grace of Shri Ganesh, the worship deeds are completed without any hindrance - Once the puja is resolved, it is necessary to complete that puja
 -is parampara se hamaari sankalp shakti majboot hoti he
 - Gets courage to face adverse situations
 upi main gyanpur (bhadohi) se samaajawaadee party ke bahubali vidhayak vijay mishra par kul 60 aapraadhik mukademe darj hai lekin upi sarkaar apane is vidhayak kii jaan ko khatra maanati he
 This is the reason that despite getting a gunner and shadow as an MLA, their security was increased to the y category
 kaaran bataaya ki vijay mishra kii beti bhadohi loksabhaa kshetra se sapa pratyaashee hai
 On the basis of these absurd arguments, the High Court has shown strict stance on the government security given to Vijay Mishra and his daughter Seema
 court ne rajya sarkaar se poocha he ki jis shaks par 60 aapraadhik mukademe darj hai use itani zyada aantarik suraksha kis prakaar di gai? kya sirf loksabhaa chunaav main pratyaashee hone se kisi ko itani suraksha di ja sakati he? court ne aadesh diya ki donon ko di gai suraksha tatkaal waapas le lee jaae
 Justice Sunil Ambwani and Justice Drs
 satish chandra ne yah aadesh diya
 Dr
 pankaj treepathi ne donon ko di gai suraksha ko court main chunauti di thi
 Pankaj Tripathi said that the trial of his father's murder has been going on for the last 34 years, in which the mlas are accused
 isi prakaar kul 60 aapraadhik mukademe unke khilaaf chal rahe hai
 On 30 October 2013, the government issued a mandate and provided heavy internal security to Vijay Mishra
 unako shastr license bhi diya gaya tathaa ganar or shadow uplabdh karaae gaye hai

 padhie, salmaan kii filmon kii panch line The controversy that started regarding immersion of idols in Kashi has now reached the High Court
 ganeshotsav ke dauraan varanasi prashasan ne murti visarjan rokane ke liye jis tarah kii sakhti dikhaai usase log naaraaz hai
 Now there is the festival of Durga Puja
 lihaaja visarjan ko lekar nayaa bavaal rokane ke liye puja samitiyaan court pahunch chuki hai
 a petition in the same case is to be heard in Allahabad High Court on Saturday
 jisamen puja samitiyaan adaalat ke saamne apana paksh rakhkar yah sabit karne kii koshish karengi kii parmparik tarah se banaai gaimurtiyonse ganga main pradooshan kaa khatra nahin hoga
 Permit those immersed in the Ganges to be immersed in natural things
 unke mutabik hoicourt main abhi tak ye baat rakhi hi nahin gai ki murti kii sthapana shastron ke hisaab se hi hoti he
 Immersion also occurs in the flowing water according to the scriptures
 jab dharm se jude maamalon main adaalatein dharm vishesh ke granthon, paramparaon or aasthaa ko dhyaan main rakhkar faisle detii ai hai to is maamle main kaashi ke logon kii maang kahaan galat he
 In fact, the administration of the High Court orders to stop the immersion of the idol will also have the responsibility to stop the immersion of the Durga idol during Durga Puja
 hoicourt ke aadesh menmurti visarjanrokane ke peeche sabase badi vajah murtiyon main istemaal hone vaale plaster of paris or chemical mili rangon kaa istemaal bataaya gaya he
 The Banaras sculptors argue that they traditionally make sculptures out of smooth clay, bamboo, jute, chaff and natural colors extracted from the Ganges
 iske alaawamurti visarjanke samay aisi vyavastha rahati he ki ganga main pravaahit kii gai murtiyon kii mitti pani main ghulne ke baad navik bans or rassi baahar nikaal lete hai
 In such a situation, they argue that the immersion of these idols cannot cause pollution in the Ganges

 Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has claimed that if India decides to boycott the World Cup match to be held on 16 June in Manchester in view of the death of 40 CRPF jawans in the Pulwama terror attack

 dubai main buudhvaar se shuru hone vaali isisi kii timahi baithak main is masale par charchaa ho sakati he
 PCB Chairman Ehsan Mani, General Manager Wasim Khan and COO Subhan Ahmed are currently in Dubai to attend various meetings and workshops
 pisibi adhikari ne kaha, ‘pakistan kaa maananaa he ki agar bharat walkover dena chahta he, to vah is par kuch nahin kar saktaa he
 But this will raise the question that what will happen if the two countries qualify and then meet in the knockout stage
 ’timahi baithak main bhavishya kii vaishvik pratiyogitaaon ke liye kar chhot, vishwa test championships ke prasaaran adhikaar or nijee tii-20 lig main pratinidhitiv simit karne jaise muddon par charchaa hone kii ummid he
 Many ICC meetings will begin with the ICC Chief Executive Committee (CEC) meeting where India will be represented by BCCI CEO Rahul Johri
 iskaa ant board baithak ke saath hoga, jisamen bharat kii ore se kaaryvahak sachiv amitabh choudhary hissaa lenge
 The main issues to be discussed include the tax exemption deadlock, broadcast issues related to the World Test Championship, limiting the number of players represented in private leagues, and the inclusion of cricket in the Los Angeles 2028 Olympics
 ek mukhya mudda isisi dwaara bharat main 2021 main tii-20 vishwa cap or 2023 vishwa cap jaisi bhavishya kii vaishvik pratiyogitaaon ke liye kar chhot kii maang he
 According to a BCCI official, however, given the current rules, it is highly unlikely that the ICC will get any exemption and the deadlock is likely to continue
 border security force kii ore se seemaa par kadi chaukasee baratane kii vajah se jameen ke raste bangladesh ko gaay-bail-bachhadon kii taskari hona lagbhag band ho gaya he
 Even though the animal smugglers are still not getting the hawk
 'tu daal-daal, main paat-paat' vaali kahawat par chalate hue ye taskar ab jameen ko chhod nadi ke raste pashuon kii taskari kar rahe hai
 But for this, seeing the barbarity that they are doing above the cow and bulls, anyone can feel angry
 pashu taskaron kii in amanviya harkaton ko parat dar parat benakaab karne vaala video aaj tak ke paas maujuud he
 In the video, it can be seen clearly how the cow, calves are tied first and they are completely helpless
 phir unhen nadi ke pani main dhakel kar kele ke do tanon main unka sir kas diya jaataa he
 This is done so that only the head remains out of the water and the cow does not die due to the oxygen being released
 phir uske upar kachra aadi bhi daal diya jaataa he
 This is done because when viewed from outside it feels like garbage is flowing in the river
 assam ke dhubri jile ke jhapasabari ilaake main gaayon kii bangladesh ko taskari ke liye ye tarika dhadlle se apanaaya ja rahaa he
 Special identities or codes are also printed on all animals including cows
 ye isliye kiya jaataa he ki sarhad paar pahunchane par pashu usee kaarobaari tak pahunche jiske liye uski taskari kii ja rahi he
 According to local citizens, BSF jawans are smuggled out of their eyes
 ek anumaan ke mutabik jhapasabari se hi har din 300-400 gaayon ko nadi ke raste bangladesh bheja jaataa he
 Smugglers buy these cows from animal traders from Assam and Bangladesh
 zyaadaatar gaay uttar pradesh, bihar or haryana se sadak ke raste laai jaati hai
 They are first unloaded on the West bengal-assam border
 phir taskar tay karte hai ki gaayon ko bangladesh kaise bheja jaae
 In addition to smuggling from the river, cows are also sent to Bangladesh by land route
 haalanki jamini seemaa par chaukasee adhik hone kii vajah se is raste taskari par kaaphi had tak roak lag gai he
 The local people these days have started coming forward to protest against the inhuman antics of cow smugglers
 sthaneey logon ke mutabik ye taskar itane bekhauf hai ki roke jane par kai baar biguef se bhi bhid jate hai
 People say that smuggling of cows to Bangladesh has increased in recent times
 bataa den ki aaj tak kii special invastigeshan team ne beete saal bhi khufia camaron ke saath assam kaa rukh kar gaay taskari kii kai paraton ko kholaa tha
 Then it was revealed that the price of Indian cows in Bangladesh is met
 ek anumaan ke mutabik bharat se har saal kareeb saadhe teen lakh gaayon ko chori chhipe bangladesh seemaa paar karwaakar bechaa jaataa he
 The annual turnover of smuggling is more than 15 thousand crores
 grahamantralay ke mutabik saal 2014 or 2015 ke dauraan biguef ne 34 gaay taskaron ko muthbhed main maar giraaya
 Assam is a hot spot for cow smuggling
 yahaan se bangladesh kii kareeb 263 kilometre lambii seemaa lagati he
 This border forms the route of transporting cows from Assam to Bangladesh
 yahaan gaay kii ausat keemat 55 hajaar rupee tak hoti he
 After crossing the Assam border, the price of cow in Bangladesh becomes up to 1 lakh rupees
 aisa isliye he kyonki bangladesh main bif kii kaaphi demand he
 Gotskar reaps the profits of the same thing

 bollywood actor salmaan khan kii family unhen har maamle main saport karti he phir chaahe wo unki personal life ho yaa profeshnal
 His father Salim Khan is often seen standing in Salman's favor, but this time Salman Khan has probably made a big mistake, only then Salim Khan has described Akshay Kumar as a better artist than him
 haal hi main ek intervyuu ke dauraan saleem khan ne kaha ki pichley kuch saalon main salmaan khan ne kaaphi impruvement dikhaai he
 At the same time, when he was asked about the success of Akshay Kumar, he said that Akshay is a very good actor
 unki haalia relies 'toilet: ek prem katha' bahut hi badhiyaan film hai
 Akshay is also an excellent actor from Aamir Khan, Ajay Devgan and Salman
 akshay kumaar kii 'toilet' kii kamai 129 karod, kya shahrukh kaa tuutegaa recordkshay aaj ek aise actor ban gaye hai jo kisi bhi vishay, kisi bhi role main ekadam feet baithte hai
 Salim Khan believes that Aamir, Ajay and Salman have not been able to grow that fast in front of Akshay who has grown and has a lot of trouble in the choice of films
 shoot ho rahaa he tiger jinda he kaa clymex, ection mod main salmaan-katrinasalman kii film 'tubalite' flop rahi or saleem khan kaa maananaa he ki 'tubalite' acchhee film thi, lekin ag salmaan kii jagah koi or actor hota to ye film chal jaati
 This is because people like to see Salman doing an action film
 'tubalite' main aisa kuch bhi masala darshakon ko dekhne ko nahin mila jo unhen pasand nahin aayaa or film flop ho gai
 Akshay Kumar's Toilet: Ek Prem Katha Happened After this interview of Tax freesalim Khan in UP, there is no statement of his son actor Salman Khan yet
 ab dekhnaa hoga ki papa kii baat par wo kitna amal karte hai or is kis taur par dekhte hai

 yah vahi muslim votbank he, jisaki vafadari ke boote party samarthak unke pradhanmantri banane kaa sapana dekh rahe hai
 Mulayam understands very well how far the Sunni Barelwis influence their voice
 ek vajah yah bhi he ki mujffarnagar dange ke baad devbandiyon kaa garh kahalaane vaale ilaake se sapa sarkaar ke liye achche swar nahin sune ja rahe
 In such a situation, if there is any loss, then it should be repaid from Rohelkhand
 vaise ruhelkhand kii baat karen to yadavon ke garh badaayun ko chhodir yah anchal kabhi bhi samaajawaadee party ke liye mufeed nahin rahaa
 Due to the presence of influential BJP leaders like Santosh Gangwar in Bareilly and leaders of national stature like Maneka gandhi-varun Gandhi in Amla and Pilibhit, SP could not find a place to set foot
 pichley chunaav main bareli seat bhaajapa ke haath se nikali to congress ne lapak lee

 It was then known that who was the biggest train of Hindustan till date? On August 8, 2016, Rs 342 crore were being carried in a passenger train from Salem to Chennai in Chennai
 paison kii hifaazat ke liye bogi main hathilaaron se las 18 police vaale bhi maujuud the
 But still the train got robbed
 ab do saal baad police ne daawa kiya he ki da greattrain roberike cese ko sulajhaa liya gaya he
 August 8, 2016, Salem Railway Station, Tamil Nadu Two years ago Salem Chennai Egmore Express train from Salem railway station in Tamil Nadu left for Chennai
 paisanger train kii do reserve bogiyon main rigerv bank of india yani arabiai ke 342 karod rupee rakhe the
 For which 18 policemen were deployed
 magar jab tak train selem se viradhachalam kaa 140 kimi
 By the time i completed the journey, there was a robbery in the train
 lutere bogi main kareeb do feet kaa chhed kar 5
 Took 78 crore rupees
 har koshish naakampahale railway police
 The local police then investigated the case
 magar chori is tarah filmi andaaz main kii gai thi ki police ko kuch samaj nahin aayaa
 Therefore, the matter was referred to the CB-CID Special Team
 team puure 2 saal tak chaanbin karti rahi
 Inquired about 2 thousand people
 tamaam pahaluon ko khangaal daalaa
 a raw sheet from railway personnel to parcel company employees was opened
 magar nateeja sifer rahaa
 With the help of IT experts, the first clue was defeated by every side, finally Spashan Cell ran Brahmastra and took the help of IT experts to solve the case
 tab team ke haath laga pehla suraag
 In fact, all the mobile numbers were active when the special cell ran the train between Salem to Chennai
 unako khangala to unamem se chaar-paanch mobile number sandigdh mili
 Some resemblance was found to those suspicious mobile numbers
 jab in numberon kii jaanch kii gai to pataa chalaa ki ye sabhi number madhya pradesh kii ek hi jagah ke hai
 a helpful question taken from the US space agency NASA was how it should be decided that these people have robbed the train
 lihaaza ab maamle ko sulajhane ke liye america antariksh agency nasa kii madad lee gai
 And through satellite photographs of the area, the search for the thieves was started
 tab pataa chalaa ki selem se viradhachalam ke bich kii is train robery ko 11 logon ne mil kar anjaam diya tha
 Both these leads for the police proved to be helpful in solving the case
 mobile numberon ke saath saath satellite tasveeron se ye saaf ho gaya ki train main dakaiti karne vaale dakait madhyapradesh or bihar ke rahane vaale thepakade gaye kuch aaropeehalanki police ke mutabik is dakaiti main railway yaa parcel company ke kisi shaks ke shaamil hone ke koi saboot nahin he
 After this, some of the accused have got their hands on the police
 kuch lagane baaki hai
 That is, the police is very close to solving the case
 bas intjaar he to sabhi aapraadhiyon ke pakade jane kaa
 Only after this, the complete story of this biggest train of recent times will be in front of us
 aise hui desh kii sabase badi tren roberyek paisanger train ke do dibbon main bhartiya rigerv bank ke 342 karod rupye 226 alag-alag box main rakhe the
 Both boxes were fully reserved and were accompanied by 18 policemen
 raat ke andhere main kareeb 70 kilometre kii speed se train chali ja rahi thi
 It reaches 140 km in two hours at the station
 ye stesan khaas he kyonki isi stesan par train se dijal ingine ko alag kar uski jagah elactric ingine lagaaya jaataa he
 The engine changes and the train then starts moving at its own pace
 magar paanch ghante baad jab agle stesan par train rukati he to pataa chalata he ki raste main kisi ne note se bhare chaar boxlutaliye hai
 You must have seen many such scenes in films on robbery in the train
 chalati train main dakaiti yaa lutpaat par desh-videsh main anginat filmein bani hai
 Seeing the scenes of those films made on The Great Train, many times your color will also have cropped up
 par aise filmi seen hakeekat main bhi badal sakate hai shaayad hi kisi ne sochaa ho
 In fact, before the installation of the electric engine, the roof of the bogie was broken and the roof of the bogie was rammed and robbers took an amount of five crores

 There was hole in the roof
 train main daaka pad chukaa tha
 Now the question was, how was the robbery in the moving train? Where was it? And who are those vicious people who rob? Who can be? Roshni was coming from the roof, before reaching Chennai, this robbery in the train may not have been revealed
 agar agnor railway stesan par pulisavaalon ne bogi kaa darwaja khol kar yunhi andar kaa muyna na kiya hota
 At the same time, an officer noticed that light was coming from outside inside the bogie even in the dark of night
 isi ke baad jab ek railway karmchaaree ko bogi kii chat par bheja gaya to pataa chalaa ki chat main send maari ja chuki he
 This is how the iron roof of the bogie was cut from any welding or gas machine
 chodai itani thi ki ek aadmi aasaana se us sooraakh se bogi ke andar aa-ja saktaa tha
 As soon as the security forces realized this, there was a stir
 isi ke baad jab bogi main rakhe oaks kii talaashi lee gai to pataa chalaa ki us bogi main rakhe kul chaar box aise the jinke saath chhedchhad kii gai he
 One of them was completely empty
 jabaki baaki box se kuch note nikaale gaye the
 Later, when all the boxes were counted, it was found that about five crore rupees were missing

 Listen to the full speech of Narendra Modi, Khurshid said, 'he (narendra Modi) is like a frog of a well

 'yatra Nairustu Pujyanti Tantra Ramanti Devta', but now it seems that this motto is adorning our sacred book because despite all the laws, violence against women in our society has not only continued but also increased
 ek aankade ke mutabik bharat main har teen minute par mahila ke khilaaf hinsa se sambandhit ek maamla darj hota he
 Every day 50 cases related to dowry are reported and every 29th minute a woman is raped
 vaishvik str par har 10 mahilaon main ek mahila apane jivan main kabhi na kabhi shaareerik yaa yon hinsa kaa shikaar hoti he
 Actually, with the birth of a woman, the cycle of violence against her starts
 mahila jahaan ghar main balika bhrun hatya se lekar honor kiling, dahej hinsa, pati or parivaar ke anya sadasyon ke bure bartaav tathaa anya gharelu hinsa kaa shikaar hoti he
 At the same time, even outside the threshold of the house, they have to face many kinds of violence like throwing acid on them, cyber crime, MMS, sneaking into the office
 madhyapradesh mahila ayog kii adhyaksh dow savita inaamdaar kahati hai ki mahilaon ke khilaaf hinsa ghar se shuru ho jaati he
 People discriminate between boys and girls in the family
 jahaan ladakon ko apane pairon par khadaa hone ke liye padhaayaa likhaaya jaataa he vahi ladakiyon kii keval shaadi ke liye parivarish kii jaati he
 Inamdar said that real girls are only considered as a medium of family growth
 is soch main badlaav laane kii jarurat he
 Girls should also have proper education and upbringing like boys and they should also be prepared to stand on their own feet
 unhone kaha ki ladakiyon ke liye shaadi jivan main mahatvapurn jarur he lekin anivaary nahin hona chahie
 According to a 1994 World Bank study, among the ten risk factors selected for girls and women, rape and domestic violence are considered more dangerous than cancer, road accident, war malaria
 jaani maani mahila kaaryakarta dow ranjana kumaar kahati hai ki police aankadon ke mutabik mahilaon ke khilaaf hinsa bad rahi he lekin khushi kii baat yah he ki ab bahut si mahilaon hinsa ke khilaaf report darj karaane pahunchati hai or kai maamalon main unhen parivaar ke sadsy bhi sahyog karte hai
 He said that the female to male ratio is continuously deteriorating due to female feticide, but not only our social mentality but also the government machinery is responsible for this
 log bete ke laalach main betiyon ko maar dete hai jabaki jin prashasnic adhikariyon or karmchaariyon par ise rokane kii jimmedaari he ve bhi isapar samuchit dhyaan nahin de rahe
 Kumari said that consumerist culture also increased violence especially in cities
 shaharon main madhyamvargeey parivaar ke log pehle to mahila ko naukari karne dena nahin chaahate lekin jab vah naukari karne lagati he tab aksar uski tankhwaah ke kharch ko lekar kahasuni or marpet tak kii naubat aa jaati he
 He said that as far as honor killing is concerned, it is reflective of our feudalistic thinking and khap panchayats are promoting it
 unhone kaha ki thik he ki kul main shaadi nahin ho, to iske liye samajhaayaa bujhaayaa ja saktaa he lekin jo shaadiyaan ho chuki hai unhen todna yaa ladki kii hatya karnaa bilkul jaij nahin he
 Kumari said that the most prominent aspect is that the people of Khap Panchayat are rich and domineering people of the village and this type of murder is done in the lower Dhyamvargiya families
 unhone kaha ki mahilaon ke khilaaf hinsa ke unmoolan ke prati samaaj main badlaav aa to rahaa he lekin vah bahut hi dhimaa he
 It is noteworthy that through a resolution in December 1999, the United Nations General Assembly declared 25 November as the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women

 ''did@mehboobamuftimake a historic blunder by not recommending the dissolution of the J&K Assembly to Gov Vohra? As per our constitution he would be bound by her advice & she would have saved her party from all the poaching that is going on at the moment
 - Omar Abdullah (@omarabdullah) July 3, 2018 New political developments in the valley have changed rapidly, these signs are being given about the meeting of J&K BJP in-charge Ram Madhav with Sajjad Lone, leader of People's Conference and Independent MLA Engineer Rashid

 lihaaja agar pidipi kaa ek dhada party se alag hokar bhaajapa ke saath sarkaar banaata he to drabu-lone-ansaari kii tikdi is khel kii ahm khilaadi sabit hogi
 Haseeb Drabu recently had to leave the post of Finance Minister due to a controversy over Kashmir being called a social problem

 In such a situation, if 15 PDP mlas are broken, the BJP can get a majority of 44 with two Peoples Congress mlas and some independents

 yah video kareeb chaar maheene purana he
 Whenever Roger Federer is playing in the final-semi-finals of a Grand Slam, everyone's eyes are glued to the TV set in our office
 yahi haal yues open final main tha
 Perhaps the same situation happens in other offices
 aakhir novak jokovich or federer ke bich muqabla saansen thama dene vaala to hota hi he
 Arthur Ash Tennis's match between the hardcourt and the two best players in the world looked really interesting
 haalanki donon khilaadi apane sarvshereshth khel ke aasapaas najar nahin aa rahe the
 Despite his rapid pace of backhand returns, Federer sometimes looked helpless in front of Djokovic's superb court coverage
 federer apni ore se aakraamak hone kii koshish kar rahe the or is koshish main unase anforced erar bhi khub ho rahe the
 On important occasions he continued to lose points and gradually Djokovic came close to winning the match set
 chauthe set main jab ve 5-2 se aage chal rahe the, tabhi federer ne chaunkaate hue do set jeet liye
 But Djokovic joined the 10 Grand Slam winning players
 federer kii haar par daftar main maujuud ek kam umr kii ladki ne lagbhag khijhate hue kaha ki federer ke saath har baar aisa kyon hota he
 a fellow said, "man, this time, Federer should win
" itnaa hi nahin hamaare senior ne daftar aate hi kaha ki federer ko ab sanyas le lenaa chahie, kyonki ve federer ko haarate hue nahin dekhnaa chaahate
 Perhaps many tennis fans think so
 aakhir beete teen saal, do maheene or paanch din ho gaye, tennis kii duniya main sabase zyada 17 grand slam khitaab jeet chuke federer ko aakhri grand slam jite hue
 Those who have seen him win 12 Grand Slam titles between 2004 and 2008 all feel that Federer should say goodbye now
 federer us mukaam par aakhir bahut pehle hi pahunch chuke hai, jahaan unhen tennis kii duniya main 'lijend', 'oltime greatest' kaha jaataa rahaa he
 So what is Federer doing now
 is sawaal par aap bhi sochiega
 But first listen to Federer's answer after the US Open loss
 federer ne kaha, 'main sahi disha main khel rahaa tha
 'pause for a minute and listen to the opinion of Djokovic
 unhone federer ke bare main kaha ki 17 grand slam khitaab jeetne ke baad bhi federer kaa khel sudhar rahaa he
 Before you talk about Federer's retirement, just think, at the age of 34, how much energy is needed to play at the top level in today's power tennis, how much power is required
 ye bhi sochiega ki us str par bane rahane ke liye federer abhyaas main kitne racket or tennis ball barbaad kar dete honge
 They have changed the racket to improve their game
 coach ko apane saath joda he
 Suddenly, they invent new shots
 yahi wo bhukh he, jo federer ko federer banaati he
 He is sure that he can still win the 18th Grand Slam title
 ve jitate hai yaa nahin, ye to samay batayega, lekin hakeekat yahi he ki federer abhi bhi duniya ke sarvshereshth tennis khilaadiyon main number do bane hue hai
 Our number one player has become number 2
 iskaa dard bhi kam nahin hota he
 He is not even expected to be number one, but he is enjoying it
 to use anjavaay karne dijie
 When he wants to retire, he will take it
 wo vakt bhi dur nahin he
 Till then keep watching this fun and quiet tennis fun
 shaayad kai tennis phens aisa sochate hon
 After all, it has been three years, two months and five days, winning the last Grand Slam in the tennis world, with Federer winning the most 17 Grand Slam titles
 jinhone 2004 se 2008 ke bich unhen 12 grand slam khitaab jitate hue dekha he, un sabko lagata he ki federer ko ab alavida kah dena chahie
 Federer has reached that point long ago, where he has been called 'legend', 'alltime Greatest' in the world of tennis
 to ab federer kya kar rahe hai
 You will also think about this question
 lekin pehle federer kaa yues open main haar ke baad kaa jawaab to sun lijie
 Federer said, 'I was playing in the right direction
 ' ek minute thaharkar jokovich kii raay bhi sun lijie
 He said of Federer that even after winning 17 Grand Slam titles, Federer's game is improving
 federer ke sanyas kii baat karne se pehle jaraa sochiega, 34 saal kii umr main aaj ke power tennis main top level par khilne ke liye kitni urja chahie, kitna damakham chahie
 Also think how many rackets and tennis balls would Federer waste in practice to stay at that level
 ve apane khel main sudhaar ke liye racket badal chuke hai
 Have added the coach with you
 achaanak nae-nae shots kii izaad kar lete hai
 It is this hunger that makes Federer Federer
 unhen yakeen he ki wo abhi bhi 18waan grand slam khitaab jeet sakate hai
 Whether they win or not, time will tell, but the fact is that Federer still remains number two among the world's best tennis players
 hamaara number van khilaadi number 2 ban gaya he
 Its pain also does not reduce
 uske number van hone kii ummid bhi nahin he, lekin wo ise anjavaay kar rahaa he
 So let her enjoy it
 jab wo sanyas lenaa chahega, le legaa
 That time is also not far away
 tab tak shant or saumy tennis ke is fankaar ko dekhte rahiye
 This campaign has been called the Public Collection Campaign
