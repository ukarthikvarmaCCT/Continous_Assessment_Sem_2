 Yash Johar used to call me the owner
 kuch din baad unka phone aayaa or ve bole, “maalik, tum ham sabaki jaan le logi

 shashi bahut bhala aadmi he
 "you might not know, but my relationship was settled a year ago
 bahanon ne mujh par shaadi ke liye dabaav daalaa or main bevakoof kii tarah maan bhi gai
 i had a relationship with someone in Najibabad, Uttar Pradesh
 main uskaa naam nahin lenaa chaahati kyonki yah thik nahin hoga
 But there was nothing going on and finally i decided not to get married there
 jab shashi ne shaadi kaa prastaav rakhaa to kuch doston ne salaah di ki jaldbaaji main haa mat karnaa
 But i have always taken risks in my life and i also knew that Shashi is a good man
 26 july, 1974 ko hamaare ghar sahil main muslim reeti-rivaaj se hamaari shaadi ho gai
 My son Sohail was born in 1975 and daughter Kashvi in 1976
 shashi ko bombai kaa mausam raas nahin aa rahaa tha
 They had discomfort due to moisture
 ek saal ham apni shaadi kii saalagirah manaane bangaloru gaye or shashi ko vahaan kaa mausam bahut acha laga
 Just, we have decided that we will settle with a form there
 hamane ek deyari kholi, subjiyan or surajamukhi ke phool ugaae or surajamukhi kaa tel banane lage
 The farmhouse was not fully built
 rahane ke liye bas do kamare the
 The kitchen was ready, but there was no electricity
 mujhe yaad he ki bachche tab gas lite main homework kiya karte the
 But i was determined to settle there and when i decide to do something, i do it
 main chaahati thi ki mere bachche kudarti maahaul main bade hon
 They learn to live with the beauty of flowers, fruits, trees and animals
 farm par jindagi badi khubsuurati or shanti se guzar rahi thi
 i learned how to make cheese at home, plucking vegetables from our land and how good it is to eat
 ham 16 saal tak us farm par rahe

 reports ke mutabik, ve is film ke liye jabardast transformansion main jute gaye he or haal hi main america main mashhoor fitness trainer ke paas eksrasise karne bhi pahunche the
 The special thing is that along with this film, the news of Aamir's son Junaid making his debut in films was also reported

 In fact, fresh flowers are invited daily for the offices of leaders and senior officers in MCD
 lekin, in par hone vaale kharch ne nayaa vivaad khadaa kar diya he
 According to the data received from the MCD, from April 2013 to December 2013 in the South and North MCD, flowers and bouquets have poured millions of rupees on the decoration, which the opposition has targeted
 north emsidi main vipaksh ke netaa mukesh goyal kaa aarope he ki jab emsidi ke paas khud kii nursery or mali hai to phir baahar se phool laakar phijulkharchi kyon kii ja rahi he
 According to the data received from the MCD, in the South MCD, more than Rs 30 lakhs were spent on decorating flowers on the tables of leaders and officers in the Municipal Corporation Dakshin
 isi tarah north emsidi main pichley nau maheenon main 5 lakh 60 hajaar rupye se zyada ke phool sajaavat ke liye kharide ja chuke hai
 'aaj Tak' also has a copy of that document, according to which in the North MCD, from 50 thousand rupees to 86 thousand rupees was burned on decorations with flowers
 duusari ore, nigam kii satta par kabiz bijepi ne ise mudda maanane se hi inkaar kar diya he
 According to Satish Upadhyay, Standing Committee Chairman of South MCD, where flowers are needed, flowers are planted only because many people reach to meet leaders and officials
 aise main offis kii sundarataa kaa bhi dhyaan rakhana jaruri he
 It is worth noting that the MCD has a large force of its own nurseries and staff, but the bouquets are bought from outside to decorate the tables of officers and senior leaders and due to this the corporation is facing millions of rupees every year

 Nothing is impossible with technology
 kyonki ab chor bhi chori(aadhaar card se ATM main chori) karne ke liye Google kaa istemaal karne lage hai
 The case is from Karnataka, where 5 thieves together robbed 9 temples
 Google Map kaa sahaara lekar inhone mandir ke andar ke har daravaaje or nakshe ko achche se scan kiya or phir ghatana ko intazaam kiya
 Yes, the way people find a way using the Google Map, the same way thieves committed the theft of millions
 ye 5 chor saal 2018 ke sitambar maheene main mili
 All together made a plan to loot temples built in far less crowded areas
 is plane ko anjaam dene ke liye inhonegoogle maps (google Maps) kaa istemaal kiya
 With this help, not just one or two but these thieves stole millions from 9 temples
 tioai ko ilaake ke supretendent dharmendra kumaar minaa ne bataaya ki in choron ne sirf mandiron ke hi nahi balki aas-paas rahane vaale logon ke bare main bhi jaankaree nikaal lee
 But not only these thieves but the police also turned out to be expert in technology
 mandiron ko lut rahe in logon ko pakadaney ke liye bhi police ne google map kii hi madad lee or inhen pakad daalaa
 According to the police, these thieves stole expensive items of worship as well as the sandalwood girls, which cost around 3 lakh
 vartmaan main centre sarkaar nai shaikshanik niti banane kii koshish kar rahi he
 This is good, education will go a step ahead
 lekin yah karte samay yah dhyaan main rakhana jaruri he ki isse pehle shiksha ko lekar jo kadam uthaae gaye the, unako bilssop karne kii jarurat he
 The reason for this is that the problem of higher education was studied in the 11th Five Year Plan from 2006 to 2011
 usase yah maaloom hua ki ucch shiksha main kya-kya samasyaayein hai
 His measures were also studied and based on that a policy of human plan was formulated
 isliye pehle jo niti taiyaar hui thi, unamem se kuch chizon ko aadhaar maanakar nai niti banaai jaani chahie
 i think the problems of higher education are of four types
 pehali samasya jo he vah he ucch shiksha kii dar yani ki enrolment number bahut kam he, jise badhaayaa janaa chahie
 The second problem is the quality of status, which should be increased
 teesri samasya shiksha sandhi kii he
 The fourth problem is useful education ie railvent education, so that students are oriented towards employment in today's era
 hamaari ucch shiksha kii dar abhi 25 tak he, jise 50-60 tak laayaa janaa behad jaruri he
 For this, existing universities will have to increase capacity and wherever necessary the number of universities and colleges should be increased
 yah mukhya taur par paise kaa masalaa he
 The government has to help the universities and increase the number of colleges
 jahaan tak quality kaa sawaal he, yah teen baton se tay hoti haih ek to shikshak, doosraa infrastracchar or teesraa paathyakram yani shiksha kram or padhaane kii paddati
 We have had problems with teachers here
 hamaare yahaan shikshakon kii kaaphi kami he or isko dur karne ke liye hamen badi sankhya main shikshakon kii niyukti kerani padegi
 The salary of teachers was increased in the last five-year plan
 isse achche logon kii is peshey main aane kii sambhaavna bani thi
 But for this more and more phd students are needed and we have to increase their number
 iske liye unki aarthik security badhaane kii jarurat he&sankhya or raashi donon maamle main
 This increases the supply of higher education
 infrastracchar kii baat to saamaanya-si baat he ki shaikshanik sansthaanon or anya shaikshanik maamalon main buniyadi chizon ko durust karne ke saath unhen or badhanaa hoga
 The educational reforms in the syllabus, credit and grading system, semester system etc
, all of them have already been introduced
 vartmaan sarkaar bhi is par jor de rahi he, to yah achche se hona chahie
 This will increase the quality of education
 teesraa masalaa he ki shiksha tak sabaki samaan pahunch honi chahie
 At present, the number of Muslim students is much less than women, Dalits, Adivasis, Hindus and Christians in higher education
 isi tarah shaharon kii tulana main gaanvon kaa pratinidhitiv kam he
 This inequality of admission to higher education, we have to overcome it
 iske liye ek niti banaai jaani chahie
 Everyone should get education, everyone has the right to increase their productivity
 so yah ek ahm masalaa he
 Similarly, skill education should be increased in case of useful education
 acchhee baat he ki maujuuda centre sarkaar ne skill deveopment ko lekar ek alag niti banaai he
 The second aspect of contextual education is that we need to provide such education so that the understanding of the rights conferred on the students is enhanced
 hyderabad vishvavidhyalay kaa maamla bhi isi se judaa lag rahaa he
 Children of various castes, communities, and religions study in universities
 ve apane puraane vichaaron ke saath aate hai or uski vajah se unke bich algaav paidaa hota he
 Because of this, there are disputes between them
 isamen samanta, bhedbhaav kii baat bhi aati he or aarakshan kii vajah se dalit-adivasee chaatr-chaatraon ke prati anya kii sahi bhaavana nahin hoti he
 So, we have to make them a course and teach them the basic feelings of equality and justice, respect for everyone's religion and culture
 hyderabad vishvavidhyalay main haalia vivaad kii ek vajah chaatr-chaatraon ke bich paidaa hua algaav he
 This separation took place on the basis of caste, ideas, etc
, because we are not able to give them the same education, so that the same sentiment should arise in them
 america main to baqayada course banaakar vishmata, garibi, jati, dharm or gender jaisi samasyaon par padhai hoti he
 In this way we can try to eliminate the distinction and walls in the campuses
 abhi hamaari ucch shiksha main aisa kuch nahin he
 Sometimes there is talk on human rights, but we are not able to give it in the right way
 ames main isi tarah ke jatigat bhedbhaav kii jaanch samiti kaa main adhyaksh tha to samiti ne bhi vahaan prashasnic bhedbhaav paaya or yah bhedbhaav adhiktar shaikshanik sansthaanon main hota he
 In this way, the need for education which removes the separation between students is further increased
 (lekhak ujisi ke purv chairman hai) Tension arose in a temple of Karhera village under the Bhopa police station area in Muzaffarnagar district in Uttar Pradesh, as a statue of a saint was desecrated

 BSP activists, including District President Ravinder Gautam, demanded strict action against the culprits in this regard

 sanshodhan main deshi sharaab kii dukaanon par bharat main bani angreji sharaab (iemfel) bhi bechi ja sakegi
 The BJP is accusing the Congress government of promoting the sale of liquor, while the Congress has accused the previous Shivraj Singh Chauhan government of advancing the interests of the country liquor lobby

 congress pravaktaa narendra saluja kehete hai, ''chouhan kii aapatti to sirf apane doston ke kaarobaar ko bachaane ke liye he
 They want the villagers to get only native liquor
 ''sharaab kaarobaar partiyon ko unke chunavi kharch ke liye kaaphi rakam muhaiyaa karaata he or isse chunaav ayog bhi waakif he

" ' Dietz said, "to change this history, prosecuting the perpetrators of such a crime is the only answer
" police ko is maamle main or aise sabhi maamalon main tatparta se kaam karnaa chahie
 The media of the country should use their capacity to carry forward their investigation and pressurize the government to take action
 ' For the last 4 years, veteran social worker Anna Hazare has been continuously writing letters to Narendra Modi, but the Prime Minister, who held power at the center in 2014, did not reply to any of his letters, but now Prime Minister Modi's message to Anna from the Prime Minister's Office has come

 haftebhar chale unke is andolan ko khatm karaane ke liye maharashtra ke mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis or krishi rajya mantri gajendra singh shekhavat ko aage aana padaa or phir anna ne apana anshan khatm kiya
 Again, the threat of agitation was threatened by Anna who ended his agitation on the condition that the central government would immediately take positive steps regarding his demands
 march 30 se ab tak yani june maheene ke pehle hafte tak centre sarkaar se koi bhi sakaaratmak baat nahin hone ke vajah se anna hajaare ne modi sarkaar ko phir se khat likh daalaa
 In his letter, he threatened the government that he was going to start a fast again from October
 shaayad unki yah dhamkee kaam kar gai or pradhanmantri offis se unke patr kaa jawaab aa gaya
 In recent days, Anna received a message from the Prime Minister's Office on Thursday after writing two letters to Prime Minister Modi
 piemo ne jawaab dete hue bataaya ki anna hajaare se milane piemo se sachiv str ke adhikari jald hi ralegan siddhi aaenge
 Anna Hazare himself revealed this during a speech at a youth youth guiding program in Parner tehsil on the occasion of his birthday
 anna ne kaha ki agar acha charitra to badi se badi takat bhi aapkaa aadar karti he

 Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) Chief Sharad Pawar gave a clarification in front of the media after his name in the bank scam
 sharad pavaar ne buudhvaar ko kaha ki emessi bank maamle main meraa naam isiaiaar main darj kiya gaya he
 i will cooperate in investigating the agencies
 shuukravaar ko main pravartan nideshaalay (idi) ke saamne pesh hounga
 This is the second time in my life
 isse pehle 1980 main mujhe ek andolan ke dauraan giraftaar kiya gaya tha
 At the same time, the ED has decided that it will not question NCP Chief Sharad Pawar in this scam
 idi keshirsh adhikariyon ne ajtak se baatcheet main kaha ki maamle main sharad pavaar ko poochtacha ke liye saman nahin bheja gaya he
 Therefore, they will not be asked at this time
 agar wo shuukravaar ko idi ke offis poochtacha ke liye aate hai, to unako waapas dajaana padegaa
 Sharad Pawar, who did not learn to bow to the power of Delhi, said that i have faith in the Constitution and justice
 maharashtra kaa itihaas ne hamen dilli kii satta ke aage jhukna nahin sikhaaya he
 He said that i follow the ideals of Shivaji that he has taught us since childhood that we should not bow down to the power of Delhi
 unhone kaha, 'main apane khilaaf karrwai ke vivaran main nahin janaa chahta hum
 Legislative assembly elections and i am visiting the entire state
 mujhe apane maharashtra daure se acchhee pratikriya mil rahi he
 Pawar said that no one should have any misunderstanding

 Also, ECIR has been registered in the State Cooperative Bank scam case against Ajit Pawar, Anand Rao, Jayant Patil

 Government sources said that the Prime Minister took stock of the price situation of essential commodities and asked Consumer Affairs Secretary Keshav Desiraju to write a letter to the Chief Secretaries of all states to take corrective steps
 iske turant baad desiraju ne rajyon ko patr likhakar unase sthiti se nipatane ke liye rajya str par tatkaal upaay kiye jane kii jarurat bataai
 He wrote, 'needless to say that the increase in onion prices is a matter of great concern for the government

 Therefore, immediate measures need to be taken at the state level to control the situation
 ' The Center has taken this step at a time when the prices of essential food items, especially onions, have gone up

 desiraju ne rajyon se aapurti shrankhla main aane vaali aadchan ko dur karne or pyaaj kii nirbaadh aapurti sunishchit karne ke liye kadam uthaane kii jarurat par jor diya he, taaki kisi bhi tarah kii sattebaaji kii sambhaavnaaon ko samaapt kiya ja sake or mulya vruddhi se aam janata ko koi pareshaani nahin ho
 Former Australia wicket-keeper Adam Grillcrest has praised Indian spinner Ravichandran Ashwin

 That ball is called the best ball of the last century
 aswin kii yah gend amala ke legstump ke baahar padi thi or girane ke baad teji se turn hui
 He hits the upper half of Amla's off stump
 ise dekhne ke baad gilcrist ne kaha ki aswin kii yah delivery T20 kii is sadi kii sarvshereshth gend he

 He has bowled best in this tournament so far
 bihar ke muzaffarpur zile main 109 bacchon kii maut ho chuki he
 This is the official figure
 media main aankada to 130 paar kar gaya he
 Till we do not understand the entire health system and budget of Bihar, we will not ask big questions
 shri krishna medical kalege aspataal ke kuch video lekar tadak bhadak karne se kuch nahin hoga
 You are still running away from real health issues
 yah ek din kaa maamla nahin he
 Today Chief Minister Nitish Kumar went to Sri Krishna Medical College for the first time
 itane dinon se is ghatana par reporting ho rahi he lekin kai dinon ke baad jab mukhyamantri aspataal jate hai to unhen pataa chalata he ki aspataal main doctor nahin hai or saaf safai thik nahin he
 This was revealed when the Bihar Health Minister had gone before the Chief Minister
 centre ke swasthya mantri vahaan ja chuke hai
 Even after this, if the cleanliness of the hospital is not good and there are not enough doctors, then the question is what will be gained from these visits
 nitish kumaar yahaan ke isiu ward main jate hue daure kii aupchaarikta puri kar rahe hai yaa bihar ke swasthya vyavastha kii apni banaai tasviir ko dekh rahe hai
 Sri Krishna Medical College is named after the first Chief Minister of Bihar
 iskaa udghaatan bhi bihar ke mukhyamantri daaroga prasad raay ne kiya tha
 Today only a chief minister was visiting here, but in the history of 59 years, this medical college does not have a post graduate seat to make a pediatrician
 yah medical kalege he, padhai bhi hoti he or yahaan aspataal bhi he
 If the condition of this hospital is that after such devastation, the Chief Minister saw less of a doctor, then what can be the rest of the situation, you can guess
 is aspataal main bal rog visheshgy banane ke liye piji kii padhai nahin hoti
 Now when questions have arisen, the interview of the principal has started coming in the media that the Health Secretary has sought a proposal for the PG seat
 har sawaal kaa jawaab ghoshnaa he, prastaav he
 The college is 49 years old, now it has been thought to call for proposals so that anger can be cleared quickly or dust can be thrown
 agar yahaan post graduate kii das siten hotin to apaat sthiti main sanbhaalane ke liye kuch doctor bhi hote
 In the same hospital, there was talk of giving ten-ten seats of post-graduate in the Department of Surgery and Gynee, but the PG of seats did not come here if the assistant professor could not be reinstated
 sochie yahaan surgery hoti he lekin surgery kii post graduate padhai nahin hoti he
 Three times more than 100 children have died here in the last seven years
 iske baad bhi yahaan acute enciflitis sindram ke liye alag ward nahin bana
 To tackle its challenges, students studying here do not have a post-graduate seat
 san 1970 main esake medical kalege kii sthapana hui thi
 There is such an old medical college and there is no post graduate seat in the Department of Surgery and Pediatrics
 lekin bihar ke privet medical kalejon main post graduate kii sabhi siten hai
 It is related to business, selling of seats
 samajhie is baat ko
 In private colleges, the fee for the post graduate seat is Rs crores
 chunki sarkaar ke aspataalon main garib bachche jate hai, mar jate hai yaa ilaaj ke naam par dilli yaa patna ke liye refer ho jate hai isliye kisi ko pataa nahin chalata he
 The Chief Minister visited but did not talk to the media
 press relij jari kar di gai or mukhya sachiv ne press ko sambodhit kiya
 There could not be a children's ward here, but there is talk of building a dharamshala to avoid the stigma of the death of 109 children
 to phir bihar ke saare aspataalon main marizon ke parijanon ko rukne ke liye dharmashala kyon nahin ban sakati he? kya sab kuch agle din ke akhbaar main moti hedline hasil karne ke liye kaha ja rahaa he taaki 109 bacchon kii maut kii khabar choti ho jaae
 i take you to the National Cancer Institute being built in Jhajjar, Haryana
 do-do pradhanmantri kaa haath laga he isamen
 In January 2014, Manmohan Singh lays the foundation stone
 farvari 2019 main pradhanmantri modi udghaatan karte hai
 In 2015, JP Nadda performs Bhoomi Pujan as Health Minister
 2018 tak 710 bistaron vaala cancer kaa yah aspataal banakar taiyaar ho janaa chahie tha kyonki isaki nigaraanee pradhanmantri karyaalay kar rahaa tha
 Even after this, when Prime Minister Modi inaugurated it three years later in 2019, only 20 beds were built
 jabaki jepi nadda 21 oktober 2016 ko twit karte hai or kehete hai ki april 2018 tak is aspataal ko aaparational kiya jaae
 JP Nadda tweeted as a minister
 lekin jab pradhanmantri udghaatan karte jate hai to do saal main maatr 20 bistar hi taiyaar tha
 When it took three years to get 20 beds equipped with other facilities, Nitish Kumar would add more than 900 beds in a year in Bihar
 49 saal ke itihaas main yahaan 610 bed hi jude hai
 Accordingly, every year only 10-15 beds will be increased
 1500 bed chalaane ke liye doctor kahaan se laaenge, iske bare main mukhyamantri kuch nahin bol kar gaye
 Everyone knows Wednesday's headline will be printed
 is hisaab se andaaza lagaaie ki kya bihar main ek saal ke bheetar 900 bed ban jayega
 So understand the headline robbery news properly
 raajnneetik bayaan or vaastaviktaa main antar hota he
 Gave the example of Jhajjar so that you will understand the announcements about Muzaffarpur
 yahaan pehle se ek 300 bistaron vaala super speshiality aspataal ban rahaa he jo jaldi hi taiyaar ho jayega
 The cost per bed in such a hospital is 80 lakh to one crore
 isamen building se lekar bistar, upkaran sabhi kharche shaamil hote hai
 So is Nitish Kumar going to pass a budget of 1500 crores for 1500 beds
 kab paas karenge? 2500 bed kaa super speshiality aspataal banane ke liye 2500 karod kab dene vaale hai? agar multi speshiality aspataal banane hai to aise aspataal main prati bed kaa kharchaa 40 se 45 lakh hota he
 Even then it will cost around 750 crores
 kya bihar sarkaar ne bajet manzur kiya he
 So beware of the headline
 yahi nahin ek hi jile main 2500 bed kii ghoshnaa kar gaye
 Three hospitals will be built in it
 kya ye aspataal aasapaas ke zile main banate to acha nahin rahata
 It is also made in Motihari and also in Begusarai
 jab tak aap aspataalon ke dhaanche ko nahin samajhenge 109 bacchon kii maut ke kaarnon ko nahin samajhenge or aane vaale samay main aise haadase ko nahin roak paaenge
 Nitish Kumar is the Chief Minister for 15 years
 haalat yah he ki unhen patna or darbhanga se doctor bulaane ke aadesh dene pade hai wo bhi tab jab 130 bachche mar gaye hai
 When Dr
 Harshvardhan came here in 2014, he said that Shri Krishna will increase the number of MBBS seats in medical college from 150 to 250
 2014 se 2019 aa gaya yahaan par 100 siten hi hai abhi tak
 Rather, in 2014, before the death of 139 children, the Medical Council of India had reduced the seats of this college from 100 to 50, which was reduced to 100 after the incident
 zaahir he is aspataal main doctoron kii kami he
 There is pressure on doctors
 system ne bhi doctoron ko is haalat main pahunchaa diya he
 Doctors have also kept themselves in this condition
 jiskaa nateeja 109 bacchon kii maut he
 Those who went to perform on Nitish Kumar's leave should continue to do this work even after the Chief Minister returns to Patna
 janata kaa dabaav banegaa, to aspataal bhi banegaa or doctor bhi hoga
 In 2012, Nitish Kumar was the Chief Minister when 178 children died, in 2014 Nitish Kumar was the Chief Minister when 139 children died, in 2019 Nitish Kumar is the Chief Minister when 130 children have died
 aspataal ko sari suvidhaon se las karne ke liye saat saal kaa vakt kaaphi tha
 There was some improvement but the name itself
 is samay is aspataal main jo isiu he uskaa haal bhi samajhnaa chahie
 In 17 days, 130 children died and the number of pediatric icus was reduced to four
 uske pehle is vakt is aspataal main ek hi piisiu tha jisamen 14 bed hai
 Later four more icus were built and then the number was 40 beds which is still not enough
 duusare vibhaagon ke ward ko hi isiu main badal diya gaya
 Where four children are placed on one bed
 ise isiu kii jagah airkandishan general ward kaha janaa chahie
 Have you seen an ICU where fifty people are running? mantri daura kar rahe hon
 The camera is recording from inside
 indian sosayadi of critical care medicine kii site par isiu ko lekar ek dishanirdesh he
 It states that a hospital should have one to four ICU beds per 100 beds
 inamen 8 se 12 bed kshamta ho sakati he
 There should be a bed in an area of 125-150 square feet, but here you can see how close each bed is to each other
 bistaron ke bich partishan bhi nahin he
 Not everyone can move in the ICU
 immergency ko chhod ek hi entry eggzet honi chahie
 But here you see what is the condition
 is aspataal main doctoron ke liye bhi khaas suvidha nahin he
 Doctors said that there is no water facility
 to marizon kii kya haalat hoti hogi
 Not only the ICU General Ward of this hospital has become a ground outside the hospital
 aap jaanate hai ki isiu main awaz kii seemaa bhi tay hoti he
 Slow voice is necessary but here everyone is talking out loud
 reporter bhi vahaan se apni report cheekhte hue file kar rahe hai
 The people of Bihar consider transporting the patient on ambulances from the village to Patna but do not care about the hospital in their city and town
 aapako pataa hona chahie ki mukhyamantri nitish kumaar apana salanaa chekup dilli aakar ames main karaate hai
 Thankfully, we do not go to America, but Patna also has AIIMS, then why does Nitish Kumar have to come to Delhi
 jab aap is sawaal kaa jawaab dhundhenge to pataa chalegaa
 Then Dr
 Harshvardhan also went out of annoyance because he knows that nothing can happen so soon
 jab aspataal behatar hota to zaahir he primary health centre bhi behatar hota
 At present, there is talk of building a two-bed ICU in the Primary Health Center, but you can understand what will happen when the ICU of the district hospital is in this state
 bistar ke bagal main oxygen silendar khadaa kar dene se isiu nahin ban jaataa he
 So why are you late in asking the question of why you are not a doctor? doctor patna or darbhanga se laae jaaenge lekin vahi kya paryaapt doctor hai
 Keep in mind that 100 people have died due to heat stroke in Bihar
 un aspataalon main apaat chikitsa par kya asar padegaa
 There is also a 40% shortage of doctors in Patna Medical College
 darbhanga medical kalege main bhi 50 fisadi doctoron kii kami he
 In Bihar, 11,734 posts of doctors are approved, and around 6000 doctors are there
 isamen se bhi kareeb 2000 doctor kantrect par hai
 Only 2300 are permanent
 bihar main 17,685 logon par ek doctor he
 It is a matter of fact that the media is currently active about the hospital in Muzaffarpur
 agar wo baaki aspataalon main ghoomane laga to aspataal kam dikhenge bihar kii garibi zyada dikhegi
 With this, if you look at the pictures of other wards of Sri Krishna Medical College Hospital, then you will realize that poverty is a boon
 yahaan ke galiyaaron main pasre hue log garib na hote to english main twitor par hesh tag kar rahe hote
 They are lying quietly
 yahaan ke gaini ward, matternity ward,pediatric ward or immergency ward ko thik se dekhen to pataa chalegaa ki is aspataal main marizon kii kya haalat he
 This is the condition of any government hospital
 garib log hai
 The women accept the doctor as God and give up their life with the help of God
 bich main system to he hi nahin
 The less the hospital, the more the platform of the railway is seen
 is aspataal main embibies kii padhai karne vaale chaatr bhi hai
 Those who have to do internship in the last year
 rajya sarkaar inhen 15000 rupee prati maah kaa bhatta jaisaa detii he
 The students here have not received work salary for two and a half months, yet they are still working
 kya pataa puure bihar ke medical kalejon main kaam kar rahe intern ko selary nahin mili he
 This is the condition
 kya ankaron ke chillane se thik ho jayega
 If it is, then what a good thing
 vaise aapako bataa den ki is kawarej se channelon ko reating mil jaaegi marizon or garibon ko health care nahin milegaa
 How to tell, an analysis of policy research studies PRS has been found
 bihar ke swasthya bajet kaa haal dekhie
 The budget expenditure for 2016-17 is 8,234 crores
 2017-18 kaa bajet kharch hota he 7,002 karod
 There is a shortfall of one thousand crores in the budget
 shahari swasthya par bajet main 18 fisadi kii kami aati he
 The budget on rural health decreases by 23 percent
 yah jaanane se aapako kya phayda? ek phayda he, fasebuk post likhane ke liye yah acha material he
 You write, when the health budget of Bihar is only 7000 crores, then 1500 crores to build a 1500 bedded super specialty hospital and 2500 crores to create a 2500 bedded super specialty hospital will come from which account
 koun itnaa paisa degaa
 In the budget of 2017-18, Bihar had kept a budget of 819 crores to build a hospital
 2018 main bihar cabinet ne ek faisla liya tha ki patna medical kalege ko duniya kaa sabase bada aspataal banaaenge
 There are 1700 beds which will be increased to 5462 beds
 ise puraa hone main saat saal lagenge or bajet hoga 5540 karod
 You will be happy to hear that
 lekin puuchhie ek sawaal, doctor kahaan se aaenge
 What is the preparation for this
 kya bihar ke medical kalejon main medical kii seat badhaai gai hai
 Salary in government hospital is low, pension is not there, so doctors are not coming
 wo karporate main jate hai zyada paisa kamaane ke liye
 Right now the media is doing that by showing a dry bottleneck of the tap, they are not raising big and tough questions about health services
 100 se adhik bacchon kii maut hui he
 We are still joking

 samay-samay par ek duusare ke saath aakar netaa isko galat sabit karne kii koshish karte najar bhi aate hai, lekin kai baar saarvajanik taur par bhi vichaaron kaa antar saaf najar aa jaataa he
 One such case has also come up through social media, where both CM Kamal Nath and Jyotiraditya Scindia have expressed different opinions about the heavy rains in Madhya Pradesh
 darasal, isaki shuruyaat somvaar ko hui jab kamalnath ne baari barish par bhartiya janata party ke puraane bayanon par tanj kasate hue twit kiya or likhaa ki vaise to barish se raajnneeti kaa koi lenaa- dena nahi hota he, lekin kuch logon ne ise raajnneeti va hamaari sarkaar se jod diya
 Since that day Indra Devta is so kind to the state that the rain is not stopping
 chaaron ore pani-pani, sara sookhaa khatm
 The message has come that all will be well in the state
 jaahir si baat he tanj kasate hue kamalnath ne pradesh main ho rahi baari barish ko acha bataaya
 However, former Union Minister and senior Congress leader Jyotiraditya Scindia did not agree with the views of CM Kamal Nath
 mangalvaar ko jyotiraditya sindhiya ne twit karte hue baari barish par chintaa jataate hue likhaa ki kai zilon main abhi bhi halaat gambhir bane hue hai or barish kii vajah se bahut nuksaan hua he
 My request to the government is that relief and rescue operations should be carried out in the affected areas with full speed so that the situation can be controlled in time and the affected people can get protection and support
 sindhiya ne kaha ki ye atyant chintajanak he ki madhya pradesh ke alag-alag hisson main baari barish kii vajah se kai jaane chali gayi
 Pray to God to comfort the departed souls and give the grieving family the power to bear this trauma
 sindhiya kaa twit mukhyamantri kamalnath ke twit se bilkul ulat tha
 It is believed that after reading the tweet of both, there is some truth in the news that the two leaders come out from time to time
 haalanki mangalvaar ko mukhyamantri kamalnath ne bhi baari barish par chintaa jataate hue twit kiya
 Expressing concern over the waterlogging and death of people after heavy rains in many parts of the state, Kamal Nath tweeted one after the other
 unhone likhaa ki baari barish se jo bhi janahani hui he, dukh kii is ghadi main sarkaar prabhavit pariwaron ke saath he
 Relief and rescue work is going on continuously
 pradesh main vibhinn hisson main baari barish anwarat jari he, agle kuch ghanton main bhi baari barish kii sambhaavna he, baari barish ke kaaran nadi-naale ufaan par he
 In view of the heavy rains, the administration has already been instructed in the entire state to take special care and caution in all the waterlogged areas under disaster management
 kisi bhi prakaar kii janahani ko rokane ke liye paryaapt intjaam kiye jaaen
 The government stands promptly with the affected families, they will be fully helped
 darasal, kamalnath ne somvaar ko purv siem shivaraj singh chouhan ke ek puraane bayaan par tanj kasate hue twit kiya tha
 When it was not raining in the state, Shivraj Singh Chauhan had stressed on the current Kamal Nath government and said that this government is dishonest, so it is not raining in the state
 isi kaa jawaab dete hue kamalnath main somvaar ko twit kar shivaraj par palatwaar kiya
 Anna Hazare vs Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawarladai has been going on since 1993
 hajaare kareeb do dashakon se pavaar or maharashtra main unke saathiyon par bhrashtachar ke aarope lagaate aa rahe hai
 And when Hazare reached Delhi and targeted Pawar as part of his campaign, Pawar resigned immediately from the Group of Ministers (gom) on corruption
 hajaare ne sawaal uthaaya tha, ''sharad pavaar jaise mantri jinke bare main sabhi jaanate hai ki unke paas maharashtra main kaaphi jameen he, us samiti kii aguai kaise kar rahe hai jo lokapal vidheyak kaa masauda taiyaar karegi?''pavaar ne 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav se pehle jo halafanama daayar kiya tha uske anusaar unke paas 8
 73 crores Rs
 kii chanchal sampatti thi
 a colleague of Hazare said, "we were alleging on the basis of speculation that they had a lot of land but Anonymous
" '' is sahyogi ne mana ki unke paas apane daawey ke pakshamen koi saboot nahin he
 But he added, "even Pawar may not know how much land he has
 '' pavaar ke tatkaal istife se atakalein lagaai jane lageen, chor kii dadhi main tinkaa he
 Apparently, the immediate reason for targeting Pawar is that Hazare had written a letter to this Maratha leader on March 30 asking him to join his opposition
 hajaare ke ek sahyogi ne kaha, ''pavaar ne yah kah kar manaa kar diya ki jis sarkaar main ve shaamil hai uskaa virodh kaise karenge
 "ally ahead," Pawar is not our target
 hamaara lakshya he lokapal vidheyak
 "the cabinet minister and NCP leader, Praful Patel has said," Where does the question of any type of crime arise? In a hot environment, he isolated himself to avoid any kind of unnecessary controversy
 '' maharashtra bhaajapa ke mahasachiv vinod tavad kehete hai, ''pavaar ne istipha dekar khud ko paksaaf bataane kii koshish kii lekin unhone mantri pad se istipha kyon nahin diya?''pavaar ko pataa he ki hajaare kitni chot pahunchaa sakate hai
 In 2003, Hazare forced the congress-ncp government in Maharashtra to order an inquiry against four NCP ministers
 hajaare ne jioem main kapil sibbal ke bhi hone par aashcharya vyakt karte hue kaha tha ki aisa vyakti jiskaa daawa ho, 2ji ghotaale main koi nuksaan nahin hua, mantri samooh kaa hissaa kaise ho saktaa he
 Sibal ignored Hazare's attack
 shahid balava (2ji ghotaale main jail main band) ke saath sambandh or ipiel vivaad main pavaar kii sandigdh bhoomika ko lekar uthe vivaad abhi thame nahin the, ki ek or vivaad saamne aa gaya
 Before the resignation, Pawar told the media, "I will be happy if you liberate me from the ministerial groups formed on all issues including corruption
" '' lokapal vidheyak taiyaar karne ke liye gathit sanyukt samiti maatr congresscivil socity panel banakar rah gai he
 This did not include the NCP (and other UPA allies)
 ensipi ke ek netaa ne kaha, ''sahib (pavaar) jaanate the ki is samiti main unhenshamil nahin kiya jayega
 By resigning, he saved himself from being sidelined
 ''upie ke sahyogiyon ko andar hi andar lagata he ki bhrashtachar ke mudde par congress apane sahyogiyon kii bali chadhaane par tuli he, taaki use clin chit mil jaae
 "after the DMK, the next target is the NCP," says an NCP leader
 '' nishchit taur par jab manhagaai par kaabo paane kii baat aati he to congress ke liye pavaar aasaan bali kaa bakra hai
 NCP Secretary Jitendra Awhad says, "it has become the easiest to target leaders these days
" or pavaar kuch kehete nahin isliye unhen nishaanaa bananaa sabase aasaan he
 "obviously, looking at Pawar's difficulties, it can be said that time is going bad for him

 Dadwal and Gupta, a 1975 batch IPS officer, were given farewell by 58-year-old Delhi Police and senior officers of Tihar Jail respectively
 dadwal ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ‘bataur ayukta mere kaarykaal ke dauraan suraksha ke paridrishy se nishchit taur par sabase yaadgaar mauka rashtramandal khelon ke safal aayojan kaa rahaa

 isi prakaar congress sarkaar ke vakt petrol par waite kii dar dilli main 20 pratishat thi or ab kejariwal sarkaar ne use 27 pratishat kar diya he
 Maken did not stop
 He further said that the excise duty on petrol was Rs 9 per liter in May 2014 at the time of the UPA government at the Center, while the Azamodi government increased it to around Rs 20 per liter, which means that the excise on petrol increased by more than 200%
 has gone
 vahiin, unhone ye bhi bataaya ki congress sarkaar ke vaqt deazal kii excise duty mahaz teen rupee thi jise ab modi sarkaar ne badhaakar 15 rupee prati litre se bhi zyaada kar diya he
 The rising oil price seems to be a big issue right now
 congress bhi ise chhodane ke mood main nahin he
 Ajay Maken has clearly stated that when the Modi government and the Kejriwal government do not provide relief to the Delhiites in oil prices, their protest will continue
 lekin modi sarkaar ke khilaaf saje rahul gandhi ke netritv vaale manch par virajman hone vaali aam aadmi party ko hi ab dilli congress tel kii maar kaa hissedaar bataa rahi he

 The question is how can citizenship qualification be a criterion in a secular country like India

 To promote organic farming in Chhattisgarh, the government advised farmers to produce organic rice and assured them that this would double their income, and now they are avoiding its purchase
 sarkaar ne unase yah bhi kaha ki unki fasal ko turant kharid liya jayega, lekin jab kisaan sarkaar kii manshaa par khare utre to sarkaar ne apana pallaa jhaad liya
 Organic rice is lying in the khet-barns of farmers, but buyers are not being found
 naa hi us chaaval kii bikri ke liye koi sarkari bandobast hi kiya gaya
 Farmers are upset due to the lack of rice
 sarkaar ne fasal chakra main badlaav kii di thi salaahchhattisgarhmen chaaval utpaadak kisaanon ko unki aamadani badhaane ke liye sarkaar ne unhen kai nuskhe die
 The government argued that if they want to double their income by 2022, then they should work on the principle of change in the waffle cycle
 sarkaar ne kisaanon ko yah bhi bharosa dilaayaa ki ve jaivik tareeke se chaaval kii paidaavaar karen
 This would give them a higher price for their yield, almost double
 sarkari fouj ne kisaanon ko jaivik kheti karne kaa nuskhaa diya or bade-bade sapane bhi dikhaae
 Farmers came under the siege of government officials
 unhone apane kheton main chaaval kii saamaanya fasal ke bajaae jaivik kheti kar chaaval kii gunvattta vaali fasal lagaayee
 Also took good care of the crops
 chemical, pasterysaide or duusare rasayanon se dooriyaan banaakar sirf gobar khaad kaa istemaal kiya
 The hard work of the farmers brought color and yield, but these farmers came at a time when no buyer of organic rice was found in the market
 organic kheti main kharchaa zyadakisaanon ke mutabik jaivik kheti main saamaanya kheti ke tulana main prati acre dedh gune se zyada kharch aata he
 They cost between 60 and 70 rupees per kg for different types of rice that are organic cultivated
 iske baad us chaaval ko bechney ke liye mandi tak pahunchane main alag kharch hota he, jabaki bazaar main is chaaval ko kharidaar adhiktam 40 se 50 rupye prati kii dar se maangate hai
 According to the farmers, huge amounts of organic rice have accumulated in them
 kisaanon kaa aarope he ki sarkaar ne is chaaval ko bechney kaa koi sarkari bandobast nahin kiya to phir upjaaya kyon?chhattisgarh ko dhan kaa katoraa kaha jaataa he
 More than a hundred varieties of rice are sown annually in different parts of the region
 rajya main kai kisaan saal main teen baar tak fasal upjate hai
 To increase the income of the farmers, the government emphasized on changing the crop cycle so that the yield is good and the crop gets a good price
 chaaval ko certyphoid karana hogaah sarkaarkisaanon ko sarkaar ne bharosa dilaayaa tha ki jaivik kheti unke liye phydemand sabit hogi
 These farmers trusted the government, but the government forgot that it was their responsibility to provide the market for the sale and purchase of this produce
 duusari ore, sarkaar kaa tark he ki ab kisaan ko apane is chaaval ko certyphoid karana hoga
 Thousands of fields have been dumped in organic rice in Mahasamund, Durg, Dhamtari, Balod, Bemetra, Mungeli, Kawardha, Raipur and Sarangarh
 kisaanon ko naa to isaki bikwaali ke liye acha bazaar mil rahaa he or naa hi kharidaar 
 The monsoon heads over Chhattisgarh
 kai kisaanon ke khet khalihaan jaivik chaaval se bhare pade hai
 The problem now faced by such farmers is that they should adopt organic farming again or produce normal rice by their traditional method
 navaklevar main aae lakhon shraddhaluon ne odisha ke puri sthit bhagwaan jagannatha ke mandir main daakhil hote hue shaayad hi kabhi sochaa ho ki mandir ke jis jagmohan se khadey hokar ve bhagwaan jagannatha ke darshan karte hai, vahaan kii chat kabhi bhi dhah sakati he
 The idols of Lord Jagannath, Balabhadra and Subhadra are replaced by new idols during the Navakalevar festival
 yah jagmohan mandir kaa vah sthaan he jahaan khadey hokar shraddhalu bhagwaan jagannatha, balbhadra or subhadra ke darshan karte hai
 He is carrying 14 thick iron pipes and four pipes at the top with all the clamps on the roof beams or else an accident can happen here at any time
 bhartiya puraatatv surveykshan kii maane to mandir kaa jirnoddhar behad jaruri he
 Hindus believe that Mahaprabhu is the Nath of the world
 lekin mandir kii sarkari-gaiyr sarkari sanchaalan samitiyon tathaa centre or rajya sarkaar ke bich rassakashi ke chalate moksh prapti kaa yah chauthaa dham jirnoddhar ke liye varshon se taras rahaa he
 The situation is that the plaster of the roof of the temple is uprooted and the stones are leaving their place
 aakhir 11veen shatabdi main hue jirnoddhar ke baad is mandir ke rakrakhaav kii ghor andekhi hui he
 In such a situation, attention is paid to the devotees who come in large numbers daily
 ve jagmohan kii chat kii beam sanbhale lohe ke mote pipe dekhte hai, jo garbh grih ke dwaar ko sankara kar detii hai, or saham jate hai
 People associated with the operation of the temple tell with a stubborn tongue that for the first time in 2004, it came to the notice that the roof plaster is eroding rapidly
 maukhik shikaayat par bhartiya puraatatv surveykshan (ees) ne nirikshan kiya or iske jirnoddhar kii yojana banaai
 But this was averted due to a lack of consensus between the local committee of the temple committees and the state government's committee on asi's decision to start renovation and minor repair work by establishing the Deities of Lord Jagannath, Balabhadra and Subhadra elsewhere
 Stayed
 mandir vyavastha main dakhal rakhane vaale sthaneey varisht patrkaar jagannatha bastiya kehete hai, “beete 11 varsh main 17 baithken kii ja chuki hai par sthiti banane kii bajaae bigadati hi ja rahi he
 "actually, an opinion could not be formed on the ASI report
 peedhishon se jagannatha mandir main puja se lekar sara kaam karne vaale sevayaton kaa kahana he ki vigrahon ko hataakar jagmohan kaa nirmaan karne se pracheen parampara khandit ho jaaegi
 All these services are divided into 36 categories due to the 36 types of service performed in the temple
 is tarah navaklevar biit gaya par shraddhaluon kii suraksha ke lihaaj se behad ahm jagmohan par kaam shuru nahin ho sakaa
 The seriousness of this is reflected in the letter dated 24 August 2015 by Suresh Mahapatra (IAS), the chief administrator of the temple, which he wrote to Rakesh Tiwari, director general of ASI
 mahapaatr ne 19 july ko bhi bhubaneshwar sarkal ke adheekshan puratatvavid or technical cameti ke chairman, anya sadasyon tathaa sevayaton ke saath nirikshan karke ees mahanideshak ko turant phone se hi mandir kii haalat kii gambhirtha se avgat kara diya tha
 He had clearly said that stones are being uprooted from place to place
 khambhon or chat aadi main daraaren pad chuki hai
 The beams have been strengthened a bit through improvisation
 par yah kab tak chal sakegaa? beam ko saport dene vaale 14 pipon ke chalate jagmohan or garbh grih ke bich ke dwaar kii chadai kam ho gai he or shraddhaluon ko baari dikkaton kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 As such, the crowd of devotees is being controlled
 chitthee main yah bhi kaha gaya ki mandir parisar ke kai sthaan jarjar hote ja rahe hai
 The pillars on the north-east side of the temple have also left stones

 kanoon mantri ke mutabik, baithak main tay hua ki ek ucch stareey team dilli main eesai ke mahanideshak se jirnoddhar kii project report par charchaa karke disha nirdesh legi
 According to him, the work was to be started from the first week of December
 bhagwaan ke vigrah ko kahin or sthapit kar kaam karaane ke sawaal par unka kahana he ki ees apane hisaab se behatar kaam karegaa
 The most contested issue of ASI is that during Jagmohan's restoration, the deities of Lord Jagannath, Balabhadra and Subhadra should be removed from their place or work without removing them? The decision is currently left to ASI Director General Rakesh Tiwari
 udhar mandir ke varisht daitapati (sevaayat) jagannatha savaimhapaatr kaa kahana he, “vigrah kahin or sthapit karke jagmohan kaa jirnoddhar karne par koi aapatti nahin honi chahie
 Yes, the centuries-old tradition of Mahaprabhu's daily schedule should not be fragmented
 ” puri ke logon ke mutabik, itihaas gavaah he ki ateet main ek raja ke akraman kii vajah se bhagwaan jagannatha, balbhadra or subhadra ke vigrah chupake se sonpur jile main le jaae gaye the
 There the three Deities were patali (immersion in the ground)
 baad main aadi shankaracharya ne puri aakar govardhan math kii sthapana ke saath vigrahon ko dobaaraa sthapit kiya
 Shankaracharya had also set the daily policy of Lord Jagannath which is being followed till today
 vidambnaa ki ab mandir ke kisi bhi kaamkaaj main puri peeth ke shankaracharya swami nishchalanand kii raay tak nahin lee jaati
 His neglect is a matter of discussion here
 navaklevar kii june 2014 kii rathyatra main unhen rath par chadhgaye nahin diya gaya tha or kaha gaya ki ve rath par sevak nahin le ja sakate
 Shankaracharya is currently in Mathura
 unke nijee sachiv manoj rath bataate hai, “jirnoddhar or ratnasinghaasana se lekar mahaprabhu jagannatha, balbhadra or subhadra ke vigrah shift karne ke maamle tak, na to mandir kii sanchaalan cameti or na hi ees adhikariyon ne shankaracharya se koi baatcheet kii he
 The tradition in Navakalavar too fragmented? This time Lord Jagannath's religious method of Brahma Parivartan of Navakalevar also broke for the first time
 is parampara main niyam he ki bhagwaan jagannatha, balbhadra or subhadra ke kashtha ke vigrah kii patali karne se thik pehle brahm parivartan kii mahavidhi puri kii jaati he
 There are only four Daitapati (sevayat) in this work
 lekin is baar brahmaparivartan ke dauraan ek-do nahin balki 65 sevaayat ghus gaye
 In these, someone took a photo from the mobile, while this method gives utmost privacy
 yahi nahin, brahm paritvartan bhi nirdhaarit samay se 14 ghante vilamb se hua
 Though the Chief Administrator calls it a rumor, the Crime Branch is investigating it on his recommendation
 brahmaparivartan kaa photo lene or vidhi main vilamb ke virodh main congress ne 26 june ko odisha band kaa aahvaan kiya tha, jo logon kii atoot aasthaa kii vajah se safal rahaa
 BJP also took out a protest yatra from Puri to protest against the breaking of tradition
 sevaayat kehete hai ki 1960 se mandir kaa mukhya prashaasak iees adhikari hi hota he par 19 saal baad aae navaklevar ko vidhi-vidhaan se sampadit nahin kiya ja sakaa
 Despite many questions arising, the government completed Navkalewar
 yah 29 march se shuru hua jab 150 chaynit daitapatiyon ne 70 kimi kii pad yatra puri karne ke liye maa mangala kii puja kii
 It is believed that Maa Mangala points to the neem tree from which dreams are made
 ise odisha main daaru kehete hai
 The tree has signs of conch, chakra, Vishnu's chakragada, Padma flower
 lekin mandir ke jirnoddhar kaa sawaal ab bhi munh baae khadaa he

 The questions raised by all about the health facility (UHC) were raised by Union Health Minister J
 pi
 Nadda is misleading
 unka kahana he ki public health care swasthya tantra kii ridh he
 He had a special chat with India Today's chief correspondent Santosh Kumar
 kuch anshavuniversal health care ko lekar sarkaar kitni gambhir he?uechasi kii drushti se hamaari koshish he ki nitiyon-kaaryakramon ko is tarah se lagu karen ki gunvatttapurna swasthya suvidha sulabh ho, ham logon ko acchhee seva dene ke liye ek sakasham vyavastha kaayam kar saken
 On the one hand there is talk of UHC, but on the other hand there has been a 20 per cent reduction in the health budget? The subject of the cut is misleading, beyond the facts
 maine kai baar kaha he ki kisi bhi maamle main koi katautee nahin he
 Whatever is necessary from the point of view of the Ministry, we are fulfilling it
 sari flagship yojanaon ko cover kar rahe hai
 UHC is currently in discussion stage
 kaaryakramon ko phir se focus kar ham uechasi ko aage badha sakate hai
 Will do it soon
 upie sarkaar kii skim ko kya aap aage badhayenge?saare flagship program ham aage badha rahe hai
 We believe that the government runs in continuity, if anything happens, it will increase
 bijepi ne ghoshnaptr main uechasi kaa vaada kiya he, ise kab tak puraa karenge?uechasi ke bahut saare bindu hai or un sabhi par gaur karte hue dobaaraa aage badhenge or sarthak banaaenge
 We will complete as soon as possible
 hamaari chintaa he ki logon ko swasthya par jo 58-60 fisadi jeb se kharch karnaa padataa he, use kam karen
 States are being talked about responsibility, but will the Center create a uniform framework or will states make their own model? We are considering what should be done
 vaise rajyon ko puri aazaadee he
 We are giving 42 per cent share in revenue to the states
 abhi nau rajyon main uechasi ko lekar hamaare payalat project chal rahe hai or sabko apane hisaab se behatar model par kaam karne ko kaha gaya he or phir ham laagat ke aadhaar par dekhenge ki koun-sa model behatar he
 It was decided in the 12th Plan that 2 of GDP
 5 fisadi swasthya par kharch hoga, lekin vah lakshya dur dikh rahaa he
 It has to be seen what is the situation of utilization
 kshamta bhi baxi chahie, sirf paisa den or baad main istemaal nahin ho to koi phayda nahin
 Money should be used optimally
 hamaari sarkaar swasthya sector ke liye kabhi fund kii kami nahin hone degi

 India has also expressed deep concern over the situation in Maldives and the Ministry of External Affairs has said that it is constantly monitoring the situation
 vahaan ke halaat dekhte hue hi pradhanmantri narendra modi kii hind mahaasaagar diplomasi yatra main maldive shaamil nahin kiya gaya
 But the question arises whether this is a situation where just talking about worrying, staying away or not interfering in the internal affairs of another country is a right step for India's own interest? iskaa jawaab maldive or bharat ke itihaas main bhi miltaa he or uske samrik mahatv main bhi
 In 1988, there was an attempt to overthrow the Maldives and then President Abdul Gayoom requested military help from many countries
 bharat ne turant faisla liya tha or oparation cactus ke tahat vahaan par shanti sthapit kii thi
 China's influence in Maldives is also increasing

 Despite all these facts, Nasheed came to power in 2012 and in 2013, when Nasheed took refuge in the Indian High Commission to avoid arrest, India thought it better to remain a silent spectator rather than favor the situation
