 ' China has asked the US not to interfere in its internal affairs on the pretext of human rights issues

 Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Li said on Saturday, "there are differences between China and the US on human rights issues on which we are willing to negotiate on the basis of equality and mutual respect
" " unhone kaha, "lekin ham maanavadhikaar masalon ke bahaane aantarik maamalon main dakhlandaji ke sakht khilaaf hai
 "li said that China highly respected freedom and rights
 gauratlab he ki duniyabar main maanavadhikaron kii sthit par america videsh vibhaag kii taraf se shuukravaar ko jari rapat ke baad china kii pratikriya yah ai he

 " rajasthan ke mukhyamantri ashok gahalot ne basapa ke sabhi chah vidhayakon ko apni party main shaamil kara liya he
 Till now, these mlas who have been supporting the Congress government from outside, c
 pi
 After getting Joshi's approval, on Monday night, he announced the merger of his Legislature Party with Congress
 rajasthan main mayawati ke khilaaf vidroh nai baat nahin he
 In 2009 too, under the leadership of Rajendra Gudda, the leader of the current BSP mlas, the BSP mlas held Gehlot's hand
 kuch hi din pehle gudda ne ek seminar main kaha tha ki unhen or unke saathiyon ko vidhansabha tikat kharidne pade the
 This merger of parties took place in Delhi soon after Gehlot and his Nayab and state Congress Committee President Sachin Pilot met Sonia Gandhi
 gahalot ne rajasthan main apni sarkaar ko aaraam se paanch saal chalaanaa sunishchit karne or madhya pradesh kii tarah bhaajapa ko sarkaar giraane kii koshish kaa koi mauka na dene ke bare main apni yojanaon se sonia gandhi ko avgat karaayaa tha
 After this merger, the strength of Congress members in the Rajasthan Legislative Assembly with 200 seats has increased from 100 to 106 while the government has the support of 120 members including independents and others
 yah bhaajapa ke liye niraashajanak he, jiske paas kul 73 vidhayak hai
 Its newly appointed state president Satish Poonia is a grassroots activist who has reached here through the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad and then the Yuva Morcha
 taqatvar jat samudaay kaa pratinidhitiv karne vaale punia kii izzat or samarthan party kaaryakartaaon ke bich zyada he, lekin isaki sambhaavna kam hi he ki ve mukhyamantri ke khilaaf morcha kholenge
 The major reason behind Gehlot's move to make the government more secure by merging the BSP mlas into his party is that the Center has recently sent senior BJP leader Kalraj Mishra as the Governor of Rajasthan
 is kadam se apni party kii aantarik raajnneeti main bhi payalat ke mukaable gahalot kii apni sthiti sudrudh hui he
 Pilot's opponents want him to leave one of the two posts before the by-elections in the local bodies, panchayati raj and two assembly constituencies to be held during the next one year
 isi bich payalat ne pehle beeti june main apane pita rajesh payalat kii punyatithi par, phir 7 sitambar ko unke janmdin par do bhavy aayojan karke apana prabhaav dikhaane kii koshish kii he
 If Pilot leaves the post of Pradesh Congress Committee President, he can bargain for important departments like Finance and Home in the government
 ye vibhaag abhi mukhyamantri gahalot ke paas hai jabaki payalat ke paas saarvajanik nirmaan vibhaag or panchayat raaj vibhaag hai
 During meetings with Sonia Gandhi, Pilot is understood to have complained of Gehlot's failure on the law and order front and non-confidence in matters such as bureaucratic overhaul and political appointments
 duusari ore, gahalot ne kathith taur par sonia ko suchit kiya he ki payalat party or apane vibhaagon ko paryaapt samay nahin dete or punjab ke navjot singh siddhu jaisaa vyavhaar kar rahe hai
 The Chief Minister is now eyeing the upcoming elections and he also wants to be seen as an administrator who takes strict measures against corrupt and incompetent people
 iske atirikt, saamaajik kaaryakartaaon aruna roy or nikhil de kii salaah par unhone ek saarvajanik soochna portal taiyaar karaayaa he jo artiai adhinium ke tahat maangi gai adhikansh jaankaree online uplabdh karaata he
 By next year, they are considering a new law on public accountability and the right to health
 isse andolankariyon se kiye vaade puure ho jaaenge
 They have already passed laws on honor killing and mob lynching, which are awaiting approval of the Center
 yah sab karte hue unhen payalat se khinchataan main hone vaale us nuksaan kaa dhyaan rakhana hoga jisaki chaaya sarkaar kii uplabdhiyon par padati he
 With the arrival of all BSP mlas in Congress, the party's strength in the House has increased to 106 - Rohit Parihar hoicourt ke dilli sarkaar ko east or north emsidi ko raashi jari karne ke die aadesh ke baad dilli vidhansabha main netaa pratipaksh vijender gupta ne dilli sarkaar se bina kisi deree ke emsidi ko raashi jari karne kii maang kii he
 Vijender Gupta on Monday demanded from Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal that he should release the amount payable to the MCD at the earliest as per the Fourth Delhi Financial Commission, following the orders of the Honorable High Court
 gupta ne kaha ki dilli hoicourt kaa aadeshemasidiki bahut badi jeet he
 These decisions will provide relief to more than 45,000 employees of North and East MCD as they will get their salaries within a month till March and with this the MCD, which is facing a shortage of funds, will get development work as per the court order
 Can also be completed
 gupta ne kaha ki dilli sarkaar ke liye yah shame kii baat he ki usne sadan main or sadan se baahar chauthe dilli vittiya ayog kii siforeeshon ko lagu karne main jaraa bhi dilchaspee nahin dikhaai
 Even the Kejriwal government of troubled MCD employees did not listen and finally got justice from the court
 unhone kaha ki vipaksh lambey samay se dilli sarkaar se maang karata aa rahaa tha ki chauthe vittiya ayog kii siforeeshon ke anuroop emsidi ko dey raashi jari kiye jaae, lekin dilli sarkaar raajnneeti or asamvedansheeltaa kaa parichay dete hue emsidi ko dey raashi nahin uplabdh karvaa rahi thi
 Vijender Gupta alleged that the Delhi government has also hanged the recommendations of the Fifth Delhi Financial Commission
 unhone chetavanee di ki yadi sarkaar ne paanchaven vittiya ayog ko sheeghra hi sadan ke patal par rakh anumodith nahin kiya to ve sheeghra hi paanchaven vittiya ayog kii siforeeshon ko lagu karwaane ke liye nyaayalay jaaenge kyonki emsidi main aarthik sankat itnaa bhayankar he ki disambar se apane karmchaariyon ko vetan nahin de pai he

 is tasviir main dekhen aakhir kis tarah chand ne kuch hi ghante main apana rang puraa tarah se badla
 Let us tell you that lunar eclipse started in India at around 11
45 pm on Friday
 shuruaati ek ghante main ye aanshik chandragrahan rahaa lekin baad main isane purna chandragrahan kaa rup le liya
 During this time, people in the country and the world stared at the sky to witness this amazing sight
 haalanki, dilli-ensiaar main kharaab mausam hone ke kaaran kai jagah chand saaf nahin dikh paa rahaa tha

 chandragrahan khatm hone ke baad jarur karen ye 10 kaamchandragrahan (chandra grahan) ko dekhne ke liye duniya bhar main log gharon se baahar nikle
 a lot of arrangements were made to see it in many countries
 duniya bhar ke liye bhale hi ye ghatana brahmad kii ek prakriya se judi ho lekin bharat main ise ek aasthaa ke vishay ke taur par hi dekha gaya
 This is how the sight of lunar eclipse was seen all over the world
 chandra grahan kyon hota he?iskaa sidhaa sa jawaab he ki chandramaa kaa prithvi kii oot main aa janaa
 In that case the Sun is on one side, the Moon on the other side and the Earth in the middle
 jab chandramaa dharti kii chaaya se nikalataa he to chandra grahan padataa he
 Read this 
 
 chandragrahan ke dauraan desh ke 10 shaharon main kaisaa dikhaa chand, dekhenchandragrahan poornima ke din hi padataa hechandragrahan poornima ke din padataa he lekin har poornima ko chandra grahan nahin padataa he
 The reason for this is that the Moon's orbit is bent on the Earth's orbit
 yah jhukaav takreeban 5 degree he isliye har baar chandramaa prithvi kii chaaya main pravesh nahin karata
 It escapes from the top or bottom
 yahi baat suryagrahan ke liye bhi sach he
 Solar eclipses are always on the new moon day because the size of the moon is about 4 times less than the size of the earth
 isaki chaaya prithvi par choti aakaar kii padati he isiilie purnataa kii sthiti main surya grahan prithvi ke ek chote se hisse se hi dekha ja saktaa he
 But in the event of a lunar eclipse, the Earth's shadow is much larger than that of the Moon
 lihaaja isse guzarane main chandramaa ko zyada vakt lagata he

 akhilesh chunaav kii taiyaariyon main jutevahin duusari ore dal kii is samasya se waakif akhilesh yadav congress ke saath gathbandhan kar chuke hai
 SP will contest 398 seats and Congress 105 seats in these elections
 ravivaar ko congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi or sapa ke rashtriya adhyaksh ne akhilesh yadav ne sanyukt press conferes or road sho kiya
 Seeing the huge crowd at the roadshow, the enthusiastic young couple talked about winning more than 300 seats
 ummid kii ja rahi he ki sapa-congress gathbandhan milakar chunaav prachaar bhi karegaa
 The defectors can weaken Akhilesh's strategy: Akhilesh is not giving ticket because the defectors are constantly weakening the SP
 kabhi mulaayam or shivpal ke saath sapa ke liye ladaai ladane vaale netaa ab virdohi dalon ke tikat par chunaav ladenge
 In such a situation, Akhilesh has to face two-four with great difficulty

 Mulayam believes that sp's alliance with Congress is wrong
 jiske chalate ve ab sapa ke liye chunaav prachaar nahin karenge
 What will happen if the results do not campaign for SP, then there will be confusion once again among SP voters and workers
 sapa ke adhiktar voter or kaaryakarta netaji se bhaavnaatmak rishta rakhte hai
 His distance from the campaign can be detrimental to both Akhilesh and SP

 emelsi aashu malik kii suraksha main lagi jed security hatwa lee
 Now there are reports of Shadab Fatima leaving the party
 aise main muslim vot roak kar rakh paanaa sapa ke liye badi musiibat he
 Perhaps this is the reason why SP had to take the path of alliance with Congress
 ye bhi he samasyasapa sabase zyada majboot upi ke madhya kshetra main hi he
 At the same time, the SP is divided into two camps
 isi kshetra main yadav parivaar kaa grihnagar itawa bhi aata he

 narendra modi 2
 0 Farmers have a big role in the overwhelming majority that the government has returned to power
 ek ummid ke saath desh ke anndaataaon ne chunaav main bijepi kaa saath diya
 The government also seems active about the problems of the farmers
 vaise pichley kaarykaal main hi modi sarkaar ne kisaanon ko lekar kai bade kadam uthaae, lekin kya 2014 main modi sarkaar ke satta main aane ke baad se kisaanon kii haalat sudhari he? ajtak-karvi incits dwaara kiye gaye desh kaa mizaaj survey se isaki jaankaree mili he
 Health of farmers: Aaj Tak did a survey with Karvy Insights to get the mood of the country
 agast maheene main hue is survey main 50 fisadi janata ne kaha ki modi sarkaar main kisaanon kii haalat sudhari he, jabaki isi saal chunaav se purv janvari maheene main hue survey main keval 20 fisadi log maanate the ki kisaanon kii sehat sudhari he
 That is, the effect of the steps taken by the government over the problems of farmers for the last 6 months is now visible in the survey
 6 maheene main teji se badla graphis survey main 17 fisadi logon ne kaha ki modi sarkaar main kisaanon kii haalat pehle jaisi hi he, yani koi sudhaar nahin hua he, jabaki janvari-2019 ke survey main naakhush logon kii taadaad 43 fisadi thi
 That is, for the last 6 months, the attitude of people has changed about the problem of farmers
 ab bhi 28 fisadi log naakhushsurve main 28 fisadi logon ne saaf kaha ki kisaanon kii sthiti or badtar hui he
 That is, these people are taking the steps taken by the Modi government as inadequate, whereas in January-2019, 34 percent of the people believed that the situation of the farmers had worsened
 iske alaava survey main 5 fisadi logon ne is mudde par koi pratikriya nahin di
 In fact, in the latest survey of Aaj Tak, the Modi government is getting relief on the farmers' front
 ek tarah se janvari-2019 ke mukaable agast-2019 main sarkaar ke prati kisaanon kii samasya ko lekar logon main vishwaas badha he
 Surveyers and Karvy Insights interviewed 12,126 people in 19 states for the survey on farmers' problems, with 67 percent interviewing rural and 33 percent urban
 is survey main desh ke 19 rajyon ke 97 sansadeey kshetron or 194 vidhansabha kshetron ko shaamil kiya gaya
 The survey was conducted in Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Kerala, Odisha, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Assam, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat, Maharashtra, the capital Delhi and West Bengal
 yah survey jammu-kashmir se anuchhed 370 ke tahat vishesh rajya kaa darja khatm karne se pehle hua tha

 *** The Aam Aadmi Party has written a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi against the free travel scheme of women in the Delhi Metro
 shridharan (E
 Sreedharan)
 aap pravaktaa saurabh bharadwaj ne kaha kiham i
 Welcome to Sreedharan's idea
 loktantr main aise vichaar aane chahie
 Sreedharan ji is concerned that the free travel of women will cause the metro to become inefficient and will suffer
 main i shridharan ji ko bataanaa chahta hum ki dilli metro ko ek rupee kaa bhi nuksaan nahin hoga
 The Delhi government will pay as much money to the Metro as the fare charged by the women
 unki duusari chintaa he ki metro ke andar jo mahilaayein free main safar karengi, unako sarkaar sidhaa paisa de de
 There are many practical problems inside it, such as how the government will find out which woman will travel to where
 kitne din safar karegi
 Will you travel by metro or travel by bus and how much money they will spend
 saurabh bharadwaj ne kaha ki yah sunishchit karnaa ki jin mahilaon ko ham yatra karne ke liye paise de rahe hai vah rashan ke liye yaa ghar ke kisi or kaam ke liye naa ho yah sunishchit karnaa bahut mushkil he
 Because the government is not running this scheme to help someone with money
 paise kii madad ke liye sarkaar ke paas or bahut sari yojanaayen hai
 Such as pension scheme, widow pension scheme scheme for women with diversion, pension scheme for senior citizens
 is yojana kaa makasad paisa dena nahin he iskaa makasad he public transport main public spes main mahilaon kii bhagidaari badhanaa
 Due to free travel, many women will travel in the metro and in buses
 aapako bataa den kidilli metro ke purv pramukh or metro main ke naam se mashhoor i

 jab metro shuru hui thi tab yah nirnay liya gaya tha ki kisi ko bhi yatra ke liemetro main riyaayatanhin di jaaegi
 This decision was welcomed by the then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee himself and he himself made his first journey from Shahdara to Kashmiri Gate in December 2002 by taking a ticket

 Former Union Minister and Rajya Sabha MP of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Subramanian Swamy started his birthday on Sunday with Ramlala's vision in Ayodhya
 
 darshan karne ke baad unhone kaha ki moolbhoot adhikaar property ke adhikaar se upar he, isi aadhaar par november main ramalala ke paksh main faisla aayega
 He said that the construction of the Ram temple will begin this year
 subramanyam swami ne doharaaya ki beete saal november main ram mandir nirmaan kaa kaam shuru ho jaataa kyonki vivaadit bhoomi ko chhodkar adhigrahit jameen par koi vivaad nahin tha
 He said, this land was with the government, on which work could be started from Diwali but everyone was of the opinion that the construction of the temple should be done completely together, so the decision was awaited from the Supreme Court
 ab november main faisla aane ke baad mandir nirmaan kaa kaary shuru hoga or isi ke saath khushiyaan manaane kaa daur bhi shuru ho jayega
 BJP leader Subramanian Swamy said, the fundamental right of Hindus is above the property rights of Muslims as it is a simple right
 supreme court ne kai baar kaha he ki moolbhoot adhikaar hi rahegaa baaki radd ho jayega, isliye mujhe puraa vishwaas he ki ham jeetenge or yahaan mandir banane ke liye november ke baad kaam shuru kar denge
 Swami said that no one can take away the fundamental right and if someone brings the right to property, then it will be turned down
 subramanyam swami ne kaha, ram mandir kii adhikansh jameen sarkaar ke paas he or usne iskaa rashtriyakaran kar rakhaa he
 The Supreme Court has also said that it can give the land to anyone and the government has also said that after the decision comes, they will do all the work together

 pashchim bengal aaj itihaas ke rochak daur se guzar rahaa he
 As i noted, West Bengal ranked lower in India Today's States of the States survey last month, due to poor performance over the past years, ranking 12th among the 20 best performing states in the country
 lekin usne 10 category main sabase zyada sudhaar kiya he-samgr vikaas, arthvyavastha, shashan, kanoon-vyavastha, udmamita, safai, swasthya, shiksha or krishi
 In this, Bengal has jumped from 13th place to 8th position in just one year, which shows that rapid change is not impossible

 Tripura in this case 9
 16 fisadi jiesdipi ke saath teesraa sabase teji se badhane vaala rajya he
 So the east is moving in many ways
 is kshetra main teen vyapak takaraav ubhar rahe hai
 The first is definitely a political battle
 is saal may main hone vaale loksabhaa chunaav main hamane pashchim bengal main bijepi kaa pehali baar ubhaar dekha
 The party has gone from 2 seats in 2014 to 18 seats in 2019 in this state and secured 40 per cent votes
 haalanki, pichley hafte hue up-chunaav main hamane yah dekha ki tiemasi ne teenon vidhansabha siten jeet lee hai
 Of these, he has wrested 2 seats from BJP
 iskaa shaayad matlab yah he ki pashchim bengal main bijepi kaa ubhaar itnaa aasaan nahin he
 The 2021 assembly elections are only after 18 months, and that is why everyone is eyeing it
 kya yah ‘ram banaam durga’ hoga? hamane sabhi raajnneetik dalon ke logon ke saath is bare main ek satr rakhaa he jo aapako zyada jaankaree denge
 We will also listen to West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar, who has been accused by the Chief Minister of running a parallel government today
 doosraa takaraav he, ekikaran banaam samavesh
 For a long time the Northeast has been on the margins of India in a way
 buniyadi dhaanche kaa vikaas bahut kam hua or yah ilaaka usee tarah se kaaphi upekshit rahaa jaisaa ki aupniveshik kaal main tha
 As expected, this is now changing
 hamane yah dekha he ki purvottar main buniyadi dhaancha vikaas par kharch badhkar 50,000 karod rupee tak pahunch gaya he- purvottar ke lagbhag sabhi railmargon ko broadgej main badal diya gaya he
 Work is being done on dozens of new railroads so that all the state capitals of the Northeast can be connected by rail connectivity
 ab se kuch dinon ke baad pradhanmantri narendra modi guwahati main yojit salanaa bharat-japan sammelan main japan ke pradhanmantri shinjo abe se milenge

 japan ne purvottar bharat main shahari dhaanche ke vikaas, van sangrakshan or tikaoo kheti kii nai pariyojnaon main kareeb 13,000 karod rupee kaa nivesh kiya he
 The third and most worrying conflict that i see emerging is again from the east, how the identity crisis is coming before us
 migration purvottar ke liye ek sanvadensheel vishay rahaa he or isane kareeb chaar dashak pehle se assam ko garma rakhaa he
 This year we saw that the National Register of Citizens was released in Assam
 yah shaayad duniya main apane tarah kaa sabase badi naagarikta pramann kavayad he
 This was to form the basis of the identification of illegal migrants
 ab tak kareeb 19 lakh kathith bahari log isaki antim suchi se baahar ho gaye hai
 There is still uncertainty about its destiny that the talk of implementing NRC across the country has started
 ek ajeeb samaadhaan jo sirf assam tak simit rah saktaa tha, ab puure desh main lagu hoga
 We can soon see that crores of Indians are being asked to prove their citizenship
 jinke paas yah nahin hoga unhen videshi maan liya jayega or jaisaa ki hamaare grih mantri amit shah ne kaha he, unhen 2024 se pehle baahar nikaal diya jayega
 We are witnessing the politicization of identity politics and it may become a major electoral issue for the ruling party
 kya 2024 main naagarikta usee tarah se masalaa hogi jaisaa ki 1990 ke dashak main ram mandir rahaa he? iske bare main jaldi hi pataa chal jayega
 There will be many sessions here in which there will be a brainstorm about the challenges of 'illegal existence' in the Northeast, politics of identity and measures to keep outsiders out of the Northeast
 lekin raajnneeti se zyada bhi kaaphi kuch he
 We will be dealing with some simple stories of struggle and victory over the next two days
 hamaare saamne bhartiya cricket ke dada saurav ganguli honge, jo yah bataaenge ki duniya kii sabase dhani cricket sanstha kaa adhyaksh bananaa kaisaa hota he

 Nowadays the railway is constantly changing its rules
 nayaa badlaav aadhaar card ko lekar ho saktaa he
 According to sources, the railway is working towards making Aadhaar card mandatory for booking tickets
 agar aisa hota he to tikat ke liye form bharte vakt ab aapako umr, ling jaisi jaankaree ke saath apana aadhaar number bhi dena hoga
 Railways are working on a plan to implement this rule in two phases
 pehle charan main vishesh chhot vaali tikaton ke liye aadhaar kaa hona anivaary hoga
 On tickets like senior seats, handicapped quota
 railway kii daleel he ki aisa karne se haadase kii sthiti main adress jaanane, beemaa kii rakam adaa karne jaise kaamon main aasaani hogi
 The amount of rebate available in the coming time can also be linked to the Aadhaar card
 jabaki duusare charan main aadhaar kii anivaaryta ko sabhi tikaton ke saath lagu karne kii yojana he
 The government believes that more than 90 percent people have an Aadhaar card and the government is trying to reach the remaining people soon
 tippaniyan Railways believe that linking with Aadhaar will bring many benefits to the railways, such as the sale of tickets will curb, ease of detection in the event of an accident, the amount of insurance will reach the right hands and time will be left in banking transactions
 railway aadhaar ko vaikalpik karne par vichaar kar rahi he
 The technical aspect irctc has completed, now the board has to decide
 kaha ja rahaa he ki senior sitijan ke liye bahut mumkin he ki anivaary kar diya jaay
 The biggest reason for considering this is the launch of the insurance scheme
 agar aadhaar se link hoga to koi hadasa hone kii sthiti main peedit kaa pataa milane main aasaani hogi
 The second regular trip is being considered to end the 6-month ticket restriction
 teesraa, aadhaar ko roope card jaisi vyavastha se jod diya jayega to banking tranjection main vakt bachegaa or conform tikat kii gunjaaish zyada hogi
 But no policy has been made yet
 is niyam ko railway do charnon main lagu karne kii yojana par kaam kar rahi he
 Aadhaar will be mandatory for special discounted tickets in the first phase
 jaise kii senior sitijan, viklang cote jaisi tikaton par
 Railway argues that by doing this, it will be easier to do things like knowing the address and paying the insurance amount in case of an accident
 aane vaale vaqt main milane vaali chhot kii rakam ko bhi aadhaar card se joda ja saktaa he
 Whereas in the second phase, there is a plan to implement Aadhaar mandatory with all tickets
 sarkaar kaa maananaa he ki abhi 90 fisidi se adhik logon ke paas aadhaar card he or baaki bache logon tak bhi jald pahunchane kii koshish sarkaar kii taraf se ho rahi he
 The comments railway kaa maananaa he ki aadhaar ke saath jodne se railway ko kai phaayde honge, masalan tikaton kii kalabazari par lagaam lagegi, haadase kii sthiti main pahchaan main aasaani hogi, beemaa kii raashi sahi haathon main pahonchegi or bankig len-dein main vaqt bachegaa
 Railway is considering to alternate the base
 takneekee pahalu irctc ne puraa kar liya he, ab board ko tay karnaa he
 It is being said that it is very possible for senior citizens to be made mandatory
 is par vichaar kii sabase badi vajah beemaa yojana kaa launch hona he
 If there is a link to Aadhaar, it will be easy to get the victim's address in case of any extent doosraa niyamit yatra karne waalon ke liye maheene main 6 baar tikat kii bandish khatm karne par bhi vichaar ho rahaa he
 Thirdly, if Aadhaar will be linked to a system like rupay Card, then there will be time left in banking transactions and there will be more scope for confirmed tickets
 lekin abhi koi policy nahin bani he
 The amount of rebate available in the coming time can also be linked to the Aadhaar card
 jabaki duusare charan main aadhaar kii anivaaryta ko sabhi tikaton ke saath lagu karne kii yojana he

 Knowing that he is not a Brahmin, it was a shock to Tiwari

" '' Most leaders, including BJP national president Rajnath Singh, are intent on declaring Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi as the prime ministerial candidate
 lekin ummidavaar ke liye faisla karne vaali party kii sarvocch niti nirdharak sanstha main narendra modi ko bahumat nahin he
 In June's Goa Executive, Narendra Modi was given the command of the Central Election Campaign Committee despite LK Advani's strong opposition
 lekin ab unhen rajasthan, madhya pradesh, chhattisgarh, dilli ke vidhansabha chunaav se pehle pradhanmantri ummidavaar projact kiye jane ko lekar party kaa antarvirodh sataha par dikh rahaa he
 However, all the leaders of the party are involved in trying to convince Advani
 aise main sawaal uthta he ki kya vaaki 13 sintabar ko sambhavit bijepi sansadeey board kii baithak main modi ko pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar banane kaa faisla ho paaegaa?modi ko aupchaarik rup se piem projact karne kii atakalein july maheene se hi lagaai ja rahi he, lekin sabakuch tay hone ke baavjood aakhir deree kii vajah kya he?sutron kii maane to jis tarah bijepi ke maamle main puri tarah se sangh kaa dakhal prachaarit kiya ja rahaa he, darasal vah party ke modi samarthak dhadon kii hi koshish he taaki virdohi kheme par dabaav banaaya ja sake
 But the Sangh Parivar, which has burnt hands on the issue of making Nitin Gadkari the president for the second time, does not want to do anything that finally shakes his head
 gadakari prakaran ko sangh kii haar or adwani kheme kii jeet ke taur par prachaarit kiya gaya tha
 In such a situation, there are now three options before the party to declare Modi as the Prime Ministerial candidate
 jabaki sangh ke saamne do hi vikalp he yaa to vah bijepi ko sidhaa modi ke naam kaa elaan karne kaa farmaan jari kar de yaa phir nirnay party ke sansadeey board par chhod de
 The pro-modi camp, and especially Rajnath Singh, is trying to get the Sangh to issue a direct decree in this matter, but even after expressing its preference, the Sangh is currently avoiding a veto
 aise paristhiti main bijepi kaa modi samarthak dhada unhen piem ummidavaar banane par adta he to jaahir he ki sansadeey board main aam sahmati bina sangh ke farmaan ke sambhav nahin he
 If the decision is left on the board, then the Advani camp does not seem to have agreed to a consensus as of now
 ab sawaal he ki agar modi kii ummidavaari par sansadeey board main voting kii naubat aati he to kya unhen bahumat mil saktaa he? sansadeey board main khud modi ko milakar kul 12 sadsy hai
 If voting is done in his name, he will not be able to vote, while former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee is not active and never attends the board meeting due to ill health
 aise main bachate hai kul 10 sadsy
 Of whom Advani, Sushma Swaraj, Murali Manohar Joshi, Nitin Gadkari and Ananth Kumar are believed to vote against Modi
 yani 10 main se 5 vot modi ke khilaaf ja sakate hai
 Now if you look at the list of Modi supporters, the president himself is Rajnath Singh, Venkaiah Naidu, Arun Jaitley and Thawarchand Gehlot
 yani kul chaar vot modi ke paksh main padenge
 Now one of the remaining vote organization ministers Ramlal, who has got a place in the Parliamentary Board, is the only full-time pracharak who sits on this post and he is considered to be the messenger of the Sangh in the BJP
 aise main unka vot sidhe sangh kaa vot mana jayega
 But under special circumstances Ramlal is also allowed to vote, even then the match is stuck on equal footing
 aise main yah dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki modi kii ummidavaari ke liye bijepi or sangh kis prakriya ko apanaataa he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke openly about Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh in the name of the nation after the abolition of special status status under Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir
 unhone kaha ki jo sapana sardaar patel kaa tha, baba sahib ambedkar kaa tha, doctor shyama prasad mukherjee kaa tha, atal ji or karodon deshbhakton kaa tha, wo ab puraa hua he
 During this, Prime Minister Narendra Modi also spoke about the resources found in Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh
 unhone kashmir ke yuvaaon kaa aahvaan kiya ki kashmir or desh ke vikaas main apana yogadan de
 Referring to a plant in Ladakh, PM Modi said that this plant is a kind of life
 raashtra ke naam sandesh main PM modi ne kiya nae kashmir or nae ladakh ke nirmaan kaa waadadarasal, us paudhe kaa naam rodiola he
 Locals in Ladakh know it as Solo
 yah paudha ek prakaar se aisi booti he jo thande or oonche vaataavaran main pai jaati he
 Scientists have claimed about this plant that it acts as a medicine that regulates disease resistant mechanisms and helps the body adapt to mountain conditions
 yah paudha radioactivity se bhi bachaata he
 Locals use the leaves of this plant as a vegetable
 itnaa hi nahin yah siachin jaisi kathin paristhitiyon main tainaat sainikon ke liye bahut upyogi hota he
 In the message to the nation, 10 promises of PM Modi that will make the future of Kashmir PM Modi said that i request that such things found in Ladakh and Jammu and Kashmir should be brought to other parts of the country so that everyone can benefit from them
 iske alaava piem modi ne jammu-kashmir main chunaav ke bhavishya ke bare main bolte hue kaha ki ham sabhi chaahate hai ki aane vaale samay main jammu-kashmir main vidhansabha chunaav hon
 Form a new government and become the Chief Minister

 usase pehle deraa sachcha sauda pramukh gurmeet ram rahim ko court main physicli pesh karne ko lekar haryana police kii saansen phuli hui thi
 The police feared that if Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim, who is serving sentence in Rohtak's Sunaria jail in the rape case, would be brought out to present physically in the special CBI court of Panchkula, then the law and order situation in the state May deteriorate and Dera Sacha Sauda supporters once again become uncontrollable

 In fact, after Ram Rahim was convicted in the Sadhvi sexual abuse case, there was widespread violence in Panchkula and other areas of Haryana
 isse haryana sarkaar kanoon vyavastha ko lekar chintit thi
 For this reason, an appeal was made by the Haryana government to allow Gurmeet Ram Rahim to appear before the special CBI court of Panchkula through video conferencing, which the court has accepted
 gurmeet ram rahim bhale hi rape ke maamalon main 20 saal kii sajaa is vakt rohtak kii sunaaria jail main kaat rahaa ho, lekin us par abhi bhi saadhuon ko napunsak banane or hatya ke kai maamle chal rahe hai
 Many of these cases are in their final stages
 lekin haryana police ke saamne chunauti ye he ki gurmeet ram rahim ke samarthak abhi bhi baari taadaad main maujuud hai
 In such a situation, if Gurmeet Ram Rahim is taken out of jail and presented before the court again and again, it will be a big challenge for the Haryana Police to handle the law and order situation in the state
 isi vajah se police kii koshish he ki in tamaam maamalon main video conferencing ke jariye hi gurmeet ram rahim ko pesh kiya jaae or faisla sunaane ke din bhi video conferencing ke jariye hi use sajaa kaa elaan kiya jaae yaa faisla sunaaya jaae

 The BJP has asked the Congress government of the state what was the treatment that could not be done in Indore
 abhi tak sarkari kharche ko kam kiye jane kaa dam bhar rahi madhya pradesh kii nai congress sarkaar par ab viipi hone ke aarope lag rahe hai
 In fact, recently, Vijay Laxmi Sadho, a minister in the Madhya Pradesh government, was injured after falling during a program in Indore
 saadho ko aanan fanan main ek privet aspataal le jaaya gaya jahaan unke haath me halkaa fracture paaya gaya
 Let us tell you here that the information about mild fracture was shared by Minister Vijayalakshmi Sadho himself by sharing his video on social media
 mantri saadho ne kaha ki 'main thik thaak hum bhaiya, mujhe kuch nahi hua he
 There is a slight fracture
 'indore main ho saktaa tha fracture kaa ilaaj'- bijepiyaha tak to sab thik tha lekin jab is maamuli fracture ke liye unhen indore se dilli airlift kiya gaya to vivaad khadaa ho gaya
 The BJP wished for the health benefits of the minister, but also questioned whether there was no hospital in Indore, known as Mahanagar and Mini Mumbai, for the treatment of minor fractures
 bijepi pravaktaa rajnish agarwal ne kaha, 'aadarneey mantri vijayalakshmi saadho ko swasthya laabh kii shubhakamanaayon ke saath jarur yah sawaal uthta he madhya pradesh main tamaam tarah kii swasthya suvidhaayen uplabdh hai, chaahe vah kasbaa ho yaa shahar, or indore to vah shahar he jahaan dadicated green coridor banaakar dehdaan karne waalon ke ang pratyaropan kaa bhi kaam hota he
 So at least do not work to discredit Madhya Pradesh
 madhya pradesh main swasthya kii suvidhaayen bharpoor hai or indore jaise mahanagar main to aasapaas ke praant ke log ilaaj karaane aate hai'
 Congress termed bjp's statement as condemnable
congress condemned bjp's statement and said that there should be no politics in the matter of health
 congress ne vitt mantri arun jetali kaa udhaaharan dete hue kaha ki virdohi dal ke hone ke baavjood congress ke sabhi netaa arun jetali ke uttam swasth kii kaamana kar rahe hai
 Madhya Pradesh Urban Administration and Development Minister Jayawardhan Singh said that when the subject comes to health, then there should never be any politics in it
 hamane dekha arun jetali america gaye ilaaj ke liye lekin congress ke kisi bhi netaa ne yah nahin kaha ki desh kaise chalegaa
 When it comes to health, then whatever should be acceptable to his family, everyone should accept that if Vijayalakshmi Sadho has gone anywhere, then the people of BJP should say that he should be healthy soon
 emsidi chunaav se pehle nigam ke aspataalon main kaam karne vaali nurson ko naukari se haath dhonaa padaa tha
 Their contract was over
 buudhvaar ko chaar maheene baad in nurson ke chehre par khushi ek baar phir laut aayi he
 All of these nurses have been reinstated on Wednesday after four months of struggle
 haalanki abhi bhi in nurson kii niyukti contract ke aadhaar par hi kii gai he, lekin nurse is baat se khush hai ki kam se kam unki naukari to waapas aa gai
 The BJP has issued a statement describing it as the result of the efforts of State President Manoj Tiwari and Mayor of North Delhi Municipal Corporation Preeti Agarwal
 party ke mutabik vigat dinon anubandh par rakhi gai 112 nurson ko unka sevakaal samaapt hone par naukari se nikaal diya gaya tha
 Since then, all the nurses met State President Manoj Tiwari and demanded his return
 tiwari ne unhen aashwast kiya tha ki unhen dobaaraa naukari par rakhane ke liye nagar nigam se baat kii jaaegi
 Manoj Tiwari wrote a letter to the Commissioner and Mayor of North Delhi Municipal Corporation and took the initiative to put him on the job again
 66 nurson ko naukari par rakh liya gaya tha jabaki 45 nurson ko punah avasar nahin diya gaya tha
 Now 43 of these nurses have also been put back on the job
 mahayor priti agarwal ke mutabik emsidi ko bhi nurson kii sevaaon kii zarurat thi or nurson ko bhi kaam chahie tha, aise main emsidi ne niyamon main badlaav kar in nurson ko naukari par behaal kiya he
 Now women will also be able to take command in the army, but this opportunity will be given to women who will be commissioned in the army from 2015
 vaise sena main mahilayen 1991 se hi shaamil hai, lekin mahilao ko lekar sena main hameshaa se hichak rahi he
 After the court's decision in 2008, women were first given permanent commission in the Navy and Air Force, but the Army with great difficulty gave permanent commission to women
 philhal, mahilaon ko sthai kamishan legal, intelligence, supplai main hi diya gaya he
 Now around 2031, women will be given permanent commission in branches like Aviation, Signal
 teenon sena main mahilaon kii haalat kisi he, iskaa andaja is baat se bhi laga sakate hai ki 12 lakh kii thal sena main mahaj 2250 mahilaayein hai, vah bhi afasar hai, 99 hajaar vaali nausena main 465 mahila afasar hai or ek lakh 40 hajaar vaali vayusena main mahaj 1100 mahila afasar he
 It is noteworthy that women soldiers are also recruited in the paramilitary forces of the country
 yahaan tak kii seemaa suraksha bal main mahilaon ko antarrashtriya seemaa par bhartiya post kii suraksha main tainaat kiya gaya he or seemaa par patroling bhi kar rahi hai
 Yes, now after 15 years, women officers in the Indian Army will be able to command their units
 vahiin, mahila adhikariyon kaa daawa he ki sena ke bheetar tamaam maukey par pratispardhaon main mahila adhikariyon ne behatar pradarshan kiya he
 Despite this, at the same time, they argue that the army never paid attention to the women officers bypassing the better performance
 or ab jab sena kaman dene ko taiyaar hui he tab vah bhi court ke dakhal ke baad sambhav ho paaya he
 At the same time, all these women officers in the Indian Army are in the sport role, but there is no question of combat role
 iskaa sidhaa matlab yah hi koi mahila adhikari ladaai ke maidan main nahin ja sakati he, vahiin, nausena main mahila yudhpot main nahin ja sakati he or na hi vayusena main mahila ladaaku vimaan uda sakati he
 On the other hand, in a hardcore country like Pakistan, women fighter aircraft are flying today and recently Pakistan Air Force Flight Lieutenant Ayesha Farooq achieved the distinction of being the first woman fighter pilot in the world who has dropped a bomb in an area
 sena ke ek bade adhikari ne bataaya ki dekhiye bharat main halaat alag hai, mahilaon ko achaanak sena main upar nahin le jaaya ja saktaa he
 For him, you will have to create an atmosphere with training, then it can become a matter
 vahiin, sena main paanch saal kaam kar chuki captain sumisha shankar kahati hai ki mahilaon ko mauka to dijie, aap mahilaon ke liye ek neshnal difens academy banavaaie, phir rigelt dekhie
 a concrete framework will have to be created before the announcement is not made
 desh kii aadhi aabaadi mahila he, lekin pataa nahin kyon mahilaon ko kuch bhi aasaani se nahin mila he
 a social activist fighting for women's rights said that wherever women work, there are many good changes in that organization
 kuch logon kaa tark he ki agar sena main mahilaayein zyada shaamil hoti hai tab sena kaa maanviya cheharaa sabake saamne aayega or maanavadhikaar hanan, aatmahatya or avsaad jaisi ghatnaon par lagaam lagegi

 Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar has written to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and appealed to him that he should be allowed to export more quantity of sugar from the country
 sutron ne mangalvaar ko bataaya ki krishi mantri kaa kahana he ki is samay antarrashtriya bazaar main chini tej he or iskaa phayda uthaane kaa yahi sahi vakt he
 He has also said that this situation of benefit for India will remain for one month
 april main sarkaar ne open general license (ojiel) ke tahat paanch lakh ton chini kaa niryaat karne ko anumati di thi
 The sugar industry wants to export 1
5 million tonnes of sugar
 sutron ke anusaar pavaar ne pradhanmantri ko likhe patr main kaha he ki gharelu china utpaadan jarurat se zyada he or vaishvik bazaar main keemten oonchi he
 In such a situation it would be better to increase exports
 bharat ke mukaable vishwa bazaar main keemten 500-600 rupee prati ton oonchi hai
 Has a higher premium
 niryaat kaa faisla sahi samay par karne kii baat par jor dete hue krishi mantri ne kaha he ki pehle paanch lakh ton chini kaa niryaat karne kii anumati diye jane main hone vaali deree ke kaaran desh pehle hi janvari-march 2011 ke dauraan chini niryaat se laabh kaatane kaa ek acha mauka gavaan chukaa he
 Pawar has told the Prime Minister, 'I clearly believe that we should take advantage of this opportunity and allow the surplus sugar available to be exported immediately
 nirnay lene main der pratikul kadam sabit hoga
 Last week, Food Minister KV Thomas said that no additional exports would be allowed until Diwali as the demand for sugar suddenly increases during the festive season
 pavaar ne apane patr main tark diya he ki atirikt chini niryaat un chini milon ke adhik stock hone ke boj ko kam karegaa tathaa unka nakadi pravaah badhegaa jisase ve vittiya sankat se nibat sakenge or ganna kisaanon ko bhugtan kar sakenge
 Sugar production in the 2010–11 season (october to September) in India, the second largest producer and second largest producer of sugar in the world
 42 karod ton hone kaa anumaan he jo utpaadan pichley satr main 1
 88 million tonnes
 chini kii vashirk gharelu maang 2
 2 to 2 25 karod ton kii he
 Pawar cautioned that the 2011-12 season was expected to be a surplus year
 iske kaaran gambhir samasyayen bhi ho sakati hai kyonki aane vaale vashare main niryaat ke laabhprad vikalp nahin honge
 At the end of the current sugar season, India will have a huge stock of 6
5 million tonnes, which will be much higher than the consumption norms of three months
