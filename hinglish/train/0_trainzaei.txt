 It is unusual that the top officer of an airline stands at the railway station or bus station to study how people behave during the journey
 july main air asia kii chif commercial officer banane ke baad se amisha sethi yahi kar rahi hai
 This exercise is actually part of attracting first time flighters as this cheap airline is set to start services in India by the end of this year
 air asia india ke siio mittu chandilya company kii ranneeti ke bare main bataate hai, “airlines jin yatriyon ko flite main le jaati hai, unke bare main ek chhavi banane kii koshish karti hai
 We want to break it
 ”haalanki, iske liye kadi mehnat kii jarurat hogi
 Especially in India, where existing airlines are struggling to make money
 kansaltency centre for asia pacific aviation (siepie) kii haal kii report ke anusaar sarkari vimaan seva air india ke alaava anya sabhi airlines ko july se sitambar timahi main kul milakar 40 se 45 karod dollar ke ghate kaa anumaan he
 According to the report, the recent fare discount of airlines has also hindered the increase in air traffic, while the cost remains high due to expensive fuel and weak rupee
 to air asia is rukh ko kaise palategi, kaise laagat ko niyantran main rakhegi or saste kiraye pesh karegi, jiske liye vah lokapriy he? kya 32 varshiya purv model or udhyami chandilya tathaa unki team yah kar paaegi? kuch aviation analist kaa maananaa he ki jatil gharelu bazaar ko dekhte hue air asia india—malaysia ke air asia group, bharat ke tata samooh or arun bhaatia ke netritv vaale telestra teleservices ke sanyukt upkram—ko or anbhavi management team rakhane kii jarurat he

 "preparing for new riders Air Asia plans to add a segment of air travelers who have not yet reached other careers
" iskaa lakshya un graahakon tak pahunchnaa he jo rail or sadak se yatra karte hai
 This is something that has been attempted by the leader of affordable aviation service in India
 aar
 Gopinath has already done his airline with Air Deccan seven years ago
 gopinath kaamyaab nahin ho paae or unhen apni company, pratidwandvi kingfisher airlines ko bechni padi, jo khud hi ab jameen par aa gai he
 Chandilya, who became Air Asia's India CEO in May, does not panic
 ve kehete hai, “main un logon ko flite main baithaana chahta hum jinhen yah nahin pataa hota ki plane par chadhate kaise hai
 This may be a risky strategy, but i am not worried about it, it is a huge market and we will take them along
 ”to kya airlines korporate yaa bijness class ke yatriyon ko nazarandaaj karegi? puri tarah se nahin
 Chandilya explains that Air Asia will keep 20 of the 185 seats on its aircraft for passengers in this category, who will get a car to carry more legroom and aircraft at extra charge
 ve kehete hai, “korporate jagat ke jo log air asia main yatra karnaa chahenge or khaas suvidhaayen chahenge, unhen yah milegaa, lekin hamaara puraa kaarobaari model unke mutabik nahin hoga
 "so will a fisherman cultivate his fishes and florists travel with his flower wares along with business travelers as well as Air Asia
 chandilya kehete hai, “main to kabhi hawaii yatra na karne vaale logon ko lakshya bana rahaa hum
 "if Chandilya's knee had not been hurt, he would have been a tennis player
 ab sawaal uthta he ki chandilya jis segment ko lakshya bana rahe hai uskaa aakaar kya he? ve bataate hai, “bharat main hawaii yatra karne waalon kii sankhya 5 se 6 karod hi he jabaki kul aabaadi 1
 2 billion
 hamaare paas dheron maukey hai or ham isi par focus kar rahe hai
 "to connect with Salikazis in an effort to make the new segment an Air Asia target, it will have to devise some unique plans for marketing and distribution
 airlines main cells kaa jimmaa sambhaal rahi sethi kahati hai ki air asia kii marketing “baari hangaamaa machayegi
 Airlines will also reach potential customers from social networks like Facebook and Twitter
 bhartiya bazaar kii jatilta ko dekhte hue air asia apni distribution ranneeti bhi badalegi
 The online travel portal Expedia will be allowed to sell the remaining seats in an exclusive manner
 vah kuch sthapit khiladinnon ko nazarandaaj kar sakati he or aise udhyamiyon ko talash sakati he jo air asia main bharosa karte hai
 Chandilya says that he has 'no illusion' that established travel portals will promote airlines that are already their top customers
 ve bataate hai, “main unke aage gidgidaaoongaa nahin
 i will go to someone who wants to invest with us
 hamaare saath aage baduya chahta he
 Willing to stand tough with us
 ”bharat ke sabase bade online portal main se ek makemytrip
 com does not agree with Chandilya to some extent
 iske chif commercial officer keyur joshi kehete hai ki unka portal air venchura jaisi kai kshetreey airlines ke sang kaam kar rahaa he
 However, he agrees that the Indian aviation market has reached far fewer people
 joshi kehete hai, “air asia chote shaharon or kasbon ko lakshya banaakar bhartiya bazaar main nayaa or romaanchak aayam lekar ai he
 India is full of opportunities for existing and new players
 ”dakshin he nishane parshuruyaat main air asia dakshin bharat par focus karegi
 An important part of Air Asia's strategy will be to start new routes in this area
 un thikaanon ko prachaarit karnaa jinamein sailaani dilchaspee rakhte hai
 Chandilya says, "the way we are going to focus on the south, so far no other airlines in India have insisted on that way
" ”air asia malaysia or thailand jaise dakshin-purv asian deshon se aane vaale hawaii yatayaat kaa bhi phayda uthaaegi, jahaan uski group companiyaan pehle hi sasti vimaan sevaayen de rahi hai
 Experts in this business say that about half of the people traveling by air from India to Southeast Asian countries are from South India
 air asia india kaa mukhyalay chennai main he
 Chandilya says, "4 from Air Asia
 3 karod yatri safar karte hai
 We have a huge database
 is vishaal samudaay ko ham bharat main vibhinn thikaanon tak laane kii sambhaavna dekh rahe hai
 “these airlines will try to provide connectivity between the metro and small cities to every point using the hub and spoke model
 isaki yojana 2014 tak bharat main chaar-paanch hub viksit karne kii he
 Apart from Chennai, two more hubs will be built in South India
 hyderabad, bangaloru or kochi jaise shaharon ko company hub banane par vichaar kar rahi he
 The company is yet to decide the names of the small cities and towns where it is to serve, but may consider any airport in South India where the A320 aircraft can land

 Airlines will standardize first class tickets of the railways to fix their initial fares in India
 uski yojana shuruaati kiraaya rail kiraye se 1,000 ru
 Have to keep more
 iske liye company ko kharchon par lagaam kasni hogi
 Experts say that Air Asia can lease the aircraft at a lower rate of interest from its Malaysian parent company, which has ordered 375 aircraft to European company Airbus
 airlines ko dekh-rekh or spanners contract main bhi sakht mol-bhav karnaa hoga
 Expenses have to be incurred Airlines have to keep the staff low to keep the operation cost down
 shuruyaat main isaki yojana prati vimaan 80 se 100 karmchaaree or baad main ise ghataakar 60 karmchaaree tak kar dene kii he
 In comparison, other airlines in India have a ratio of 102 to 185 employees per aircraft
 pehle ke mukaable kam vetan par airlines se judye vaale chandilya har contract ke liye jamkar mol-taul kar rahe hai
 Be it with employees, vendors, airports or marketing agencies, so as to keep costs down
 unhone bataaya, “cabin kru kii bhartee main ham bilkul buniyadi str tak har cheez ke liye mol-bhav kar rahe hai
 We are ensuring that the contract is performance based rather than heavy base
 ”airlines main philhal 200 karmchaaree hai or jab tak use sabhi regulatory manjuuri nahin milteen, tab tak bhartee kii raftaar dhimi rahegi
 Chandilya said, "having to spend so much every month (without operation) means maximum loss
 ” lekin aviation export laagat kam rakhane ke liye karmchaariyon kii sankhya main katautee kii ranneeti ko khaarij karte hai
 Mark Martin, founder and CEO of Dubai-based airline advisory firm Martin Consultancy, says, "the cost of human resources does not exceed 10 to 18 percent of the total cost of an airline
 isliye air asia kam karmchaariyon se bahut kuch hasil nahin kar sakati
 Martin, who has worked with India's low-cost airline spicejet, questioned the model of fixing Air Asia fares based on rail fares
 unhone kaha, “bhartiya graahakon ke liye rail or hawaii yatra alag-alag uddeshy ke liye bani hai
 Nowhere in the world do airlines try to compete with rail
 air asia ko sthaneey jaruraton ke mutabik model taiyaar karne kii jarurat he
 “air Asia will remain away from Delhi and Mumbai airports due to heavy expenditure in the form of aircraft parking, navigation and landing charges
 in donon airport par airport shulk main pichley saal chaar guna se zyada vruddhi hui he
 Chandilya says that there is also a problem of jam at these two busiest airports in the country, which increases fuel costs
 chandilya ko ummid he ki in sabhi prayaason kii vajah se airlines oparation ke tisare maheene se hi paisa bananaa shuru kar degi
 Experts consider it to be too optimistic
 aviation kansalting form siepie ke dakshin asia pramukh kapil kaul kehete hai, “air asia ke liye shuruaati 12 se 18 maheene kaaphi chunauteepurn honge
 Kaul said that the founders of Air Asia have committed to give an initial capital of $ 30 million, indicating that the airlines have little capital
 haalanki, chandilya drudh dikhte hai
 He dismisses that the airlines are finding it difficult to start operating from the scheduled time till November due to the delay in obtaining regulatory clearance
 ve kehete hai, “ye to bas dhyaan bhatakaane kii baaten hai
 i look forward to getting the approval
 yah jaldi hi hoga
 “for new airlines like Air Asia, it will be easier to keep costs and fares down
 nishchit rup se iske pratidwandvi bhi kiraaya kam karne kii koshish karenge
 But Chandilya has no fear of this
 ve kehete hai, “unhen aisa karne to den
 It will be better for us because then they will come and play games in our area, where we can beat them badly

 The Congress leader said that today there is also jumlascience in the country, education is also there, economy is also there and philosophy is also there
 kyonki kuch log iske peeche lage hai
 On the degree of PM Modi, Digvijay Singh said that in this country it is to remain secret how educated the Prime Minister is
 kisi ko pataa nahin lagata chahie, shaadishuda he ki nahin? digvijay kii maane to unhen samaj main nahin aayaa ki 'intair political science' kya subject kya he? ise kahaan padhaayaa jaataa he

 isamen keval vipakshi partiyaan hi nahin, bijepi ke bhi kuch netaa honge
 According to Digvijay, in the Lok Sabha elections 2014, BJP got only 31 percent of the vote
 jise modi or shah badi jeet maanate hai
 But he does not know that 69 percent of the people did not vote for him, then how can you consider him a big victory

 This festival celebrated in the autumn is also a symbol of the victory of good against evil

 During the 'dussehra Festival' in Mysore, the atmosphere is ecstatic

 The Navaratri festival was celebrated in this kingdom, established in the fourteenth century by two brothers named Harihara and Bukka
 lagbhag chah shatabdi puraane is parvo ko wadeyar rajvansh ke lokapriy shaasha krishnaraj wadeyar ne dashahara kaa naam diya
 Many medieval tourists and writers have mentioned the celebration of Dussehra in the capital city of Hampi in their travelogues
 in lekhakon ne hampi main manaae jane vaale dashahra utsav ke vistrut varnan kiye he
 The same tradition of the Vijayanagara rulers reached Mysore

 vijaynagar samrajya ke patan ke baad wadeyar rajgaraane ke aathven shaasha raja wadeyar ne yahaan kii paaramparik dashahra mahotsav kii parampara ko jivit rakhaa
 The face of today's festivities has changed considerably from the traditional Dussehra celebrations of the Wadeyar kings
 yah ab ek antarrashtriya utsav ban gaya he
 Tourists arriving in Mysore from different parts of the country and the world to participate in this festival are stunned by the variety of Dussehra activities
 tej roshni main nahaaya mysore mahal, phulon or pattiyon se saje chadhaave, saanskrithik kaarykram khel-kud, gombe hubba or videshi mehmaanon se lekar jambo sawari tak har baat unhen khaas taur par aakarshith karti he
 Over time the popularity of the festival grew so much that in 2008 the Government of Karnataka gave it a status of Rajyotsava which is called Nad Habba
 jammu kashmir ke kathua or uttar pradesh ke unnav main balaatkaar kii do ghatnaon ke baad faile janaakrosh ko dekhte hue centre sarkaar ne protection of children from sexual offences (poxo) act main sanshodhan kiye hai
 Under the new legal provisions, now those who rape children below 12 years of age can be sentenced to death
 in praavdhaanon ko kendriya cabinet se manjuuri milane ke choubees ghante ke bheetar raashtrapati ne bhi apni sahmati de di
 The central government showed readiness in this matter
 haalanki, sarkaar yaa nyaaypalika kii ore se aaj tak is sawaal kaa jawaab nahin diya gaya he ki kya maut kii sajaa kaa praavdhaan karne se aparaadhon main kami aati he?poxo main nae praavdhaanon se bacchon kii suraksha ko khatra?rape ke maamalon main faansee kaa praavdhaan 2012 main dilli ke nirbhaya gangrape ke baad se hi kar diya gaya tha
 Despite this, there was no decrease in cases of rape
 bacchon se rape ke maamle adhik samvedansheel hote hai
 According to a 2015 report by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), in 95% of cases of rape with children, the accused are acquainted
 aise main bacchon se rape ke maamle main maut kii sajaa kaa praavdhaan hone se bacchon kii suraksha ko khatra paidaa ho saktaa he
 There are fewer options than adults to register sexual offenses against children
 unhen isaki report se lekar jaanch tak ke liye apane parichiton yaa parijanon par hi nirbhar rahanaa padataa he
 Advocate Ravindra Gadhia in the Supreme Court believes that if new laws reduce the number of rape cases against children, it would be a welcome move, but international experience suggests that capital punishment has not reduced crime
 vah kehete hai ki poxo act main maut kii sajaa ke praavdhaan se peedit bacchon ke liye khatra bad saktaa he
 Accused can also harm children by knowing their life is in danger
 is maamle main bacchon kii suraksha ke liye vishesh nirdesh jari nahin kiye gaye hai, na hi anya jaruri kadam uthaae gaye hai
 Dr
 Prof
 was a professor of political science at Kumaon University
 prabhaat kumaar upreti kehete hai ki apradhi yah soch kar vyavhaar nahin karata ki use faansee lagegi yaa nahin
 He behaves like a frenzied and sick man
 nyaay vyavastha kaa makasad hota he aise apradhi main sudhaar laana, lekin mrityudand insaanon main sudhaar kii sambhaavna ko hi khatm maan letaa he
 How capable are we to give justice to children? The new provisions of the Poxo Act have also asked for early hearing of rape cases from children
 NCRB ke mutabik 2016 main adaalaton ke saamne poxo act ke tahat bacchon se rape ke 64 hajaar 138 maamle aae
 Of these, only 1869 was sentenced in Section 376 of IPC (section of Punishment in cases of rape)
 bacchon se rape ke kul darj maamalon ke 3 fisadi se bhi kam main faisla aa sakaa
 That is, the judicial structure in our country is not competent enough for early hearing
 lau kamishan kii 1987 main ai report kahati he ki desh main 10 lakh kii aabaadi par 50 jaj hone chahie, jabaki kanoon mantralay ke mutabik 2016 tak har 10 lakh kii aabaadi par keval 18 jaj hi uplabdh the
 Advocate Ravindra Gadhia says that the lack of court will be done by making someone from the present court a fast track court, but the appointment of judges is a big question
 iske bina cese pending hi rahenge
 With this, he says that for sensitive cases like rape of children, more important than the formation of a court is to improve the level of investigation
 mrityudand: sajaa dena yaa badla lenaa?bharat main mrityudand kii sajaa kaa strot 1860 kii ipisi he
 Dr
 prabhaat upreti bataate hai ki yah code likhte samay maikale ne kaha tha ki unhen nahin lagata ki mrityudand se koi phayda hoga, haalanki drafting cameti ne is praavdhaan ko jari rakhaa
 According to Upreti, capital punishment is the most common punishment in our society and the difference between punishment and revenge is not clear in the minds of those who demand such
 isliye aksar rape ke aaropee ko bheed ke hawaale karne, ling kaat dene yaa faansee dene kii maangen tak uthati rahati hai
 Let us tell you that the Justice Verma Committee, formed after the Nirbhaya gang rape, also said that the death penalty in rape cases will prove to be a backward step towards law reform
 cameti ne varking group on human rhite (WGHR) kii report kaa hawala dekar kaha tha ki 1980 ke baad se bharat main faansee kii sajaa kii dar main kami ai he
 Despite this, there has also been a decrease in serious crimes like murder
 yani gambhir aparaadhon or faansee kaa aapas main sambandh nahin he
 The committee wanted to keep the maximum sentence of life imprisonment in serious cases of rape
 cameti kii tippanee thi ki yah keval myth he ki gambhir aparaadh ke maamalon ko rokane ke liye maut kii sajaa kargar hoti he
 Death penalty given to children for stealing pen
 upreti kehete hai, 'itihaas main jhaankne par pataa chalata he ki maut kii sajaa us samay ke nayakon ko bhi di gai or inamen sucraat, isa messiah, robspeare se lekar bhagat singh tak shaamil hai or duusare sandarbhon main gandhi kaa naam bhi joda ja saktaa he
 In England, children were given the death penalty for stealing a pen at one time and even then there were people who justified it
 maut kii sajaa asal main kabeelai samaaj kii upaj thi
 Later, the political system was governed by religions and the judicial system with morality
 adhikansh dharmon kii sabase bady sajaa mrityudand hi dekhne ko milti he
 Therefore, those who spoke against the evils and superstitions were also sentenced to death on moral grounds
 dharm ke baad rajya sattaaon ne bhi ise jari rakhaa
 In the revolutions of France, Russia and America, this punishment became a means to eliminate their opponents
 'jab faansee dene ke baad hua galati kaa ahsasanyayik vyavastha main maut kii sajaa par sawaal keval hamaare desh main nahin duniya bhar main uthte rahe hai
 Dr
 upreti bataate hai ki italy ke kanoonvid sijer bakaaria ne 1764 main apane paper 'aise on krime and panishment' main likhaa ki sabhy samaaj banane ke liye maut kii sajaa ko khatm karnaa jaruri he
 He had questioned how foolish it is that only the laws made to save a human being are taking his life
 jabaki ek samprabhu rajya main naagarik kii jaan lene kaa adhikaar rajya ko nahin he
 Upreti says that if there is a mistake in giving the death penalty then it cannot be rectified as in the case of Santosh Kumar Bariar v
 State of Maharashtra in 2009
 justise sinha or firaaq joseph ne 13 mrityudand galatfahami main die the or unamem se do ko faansee bhi lag gai thi
 In such a situation, their life cannot be brought back
 bharat main kya kehete hai faansee ke aankade?neshnal lau uniwarsity dilli (NLUD) ne apni 'deth penlti india report 2016' main bataaya he ki america kaa supreme court bhi rape or bacchon se rape (gaiyr-hatya) ke maamalon main maut kii sajaa kaa virodh kar chukaa he
 In this report, NLUD spoke to 385 prisoners sentenced to death in India, of which 373 were from economically and socially backward backgrounds
 is adhyayan ke mutabik maut kii sajaa paae 23 fisadi logon ne kabhi skulon kaa munh nahin dekha, 9
 6 percent did not complete primary education and 61
 6 fisadi logon ne secondary skool kii shiksha hasil nahin kii thi
 In addition, 76 percent were from religious minorities and backward classes and 74 percent were in financially pathetic condition
 phir kaise rukenge bacchon se hone vaale rape?mrityudand bhi vibhats maane jane vaale aparaadhon ko rokane main vifal sabit hota he to bacchon se rape jaise maamalon ko rokane ke liye hamaare paas koun sa rasta bachataa he? iske jawaab main rabindra gadhiya kehete hai, 'sabase pehle to sarkaron ko janata kii bhaawanaaon se khilwaad band karnaa chahie
 If people feel that death penalty will reduce the number of rape cases, then the government immediately agrees to such demands to satisfy the public, while it should honestly give examples and figures from all over the world that hanging It does not reduce crime

 nyaayamurti librehan ne kaha, ‘‘main loktantric prakriya ko sanchalit karne ke liye aachaar samhita yaa niyam nahin bataa saktaa, lekin main yah sifarish jarur karuunga ki dharm ko raajnneeti se alag karne ke bare main adhyayan ho or jitani jaldi sambhav ho, ise lagu kiya jaae

 The BCCI and Bangladesh Cricket Board have agreed to play the Test match with a pink ball starting at 22 November at Eden Gardens
 is de-nite test match kii taiyaariyon main haalanki bahut kam samay bachaa he
 However, the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) has experience in organizing matches with the pink ball
 bhartiya cricket main 22 saal tak seva dene ke baad bisisiai ke mukhya curator pad se pichley maheene sevanivruth hone vaale dalajit ne pitiai se kaha, ‘os mukhya chintaa hogi
 There is no doubt about it
 unhen samajhnaa hoga ki aap isse batch nahin sakate ho
 He said, "to protect this, the grass in the outfield will have to be less and on the pitch more grass than the common grass
 outfield main jitani adhik ghaas hogi, os kii pareshaani utani zyada hogi
 'the match is expected to start at 1:30 pm after noon and the game can go on till 8

 You may remember when the first day-night Test match was played in Adelaide (in 2017), he laid 11 mm grass on the pitch
 aapako itani ghaas ko taiyaar karnaa hoga
 You cannot cut it the day before the match or the pitch will play slower
 ’dalajit ne kaha, ‘(dalip trophy maichon ke dauraan) os ek masalaa tha, gend vastav main gandi ho jaati thi
 There was seven mm grass on the pitch whereas grass 2 generally
 5 se chaar mimi lambii hoti he
 The grass being long means that the ball will seam too high
 ’ ek anya curator ne gopneeyata kii shart par match se do teen din pehle se outfield kii ghaas par pani na daalane kii salaah di
 He said, 'dew will be the issue but then there will not be too much cold
 supersopers ke alaava os se nibatane main upyogi rasayanon kaa upyog kiya ja saktaa he
 There will be considerable grass cutting in the outfield
 match se do din pehle pani daalana band karnaa hoga kyonki isse nami ban jaaegi
 "we usually keep seven to eight mm grass in the outfield, but it can be kept six mm for day-night test matches," he said
 isse aap os kaa prabhaav kam kar sakate hai, lekin aap prakritik paristhitiyon se puri tarah nahin nibat sakate ho

 aam aadmi party (AAP) ke saath gathbandhan karne ke mudde par do hisson main banty dilli congress ke saamne nai chintaa paidaa ho gai he
 Senior Muslim leaders of the Congress expressed displeasure and feared that no Muslim leader would get a ticket in the Lok Sabha elections
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ko shanivaar ko likhe patr main paanch purv vidhayakon ne chandani chowk yaa uttar purv dilli loksabhaa siton se kisi muslim netaa ko utaarne kii maang kii he
 Three of these leaders have been Delhi mlas five times

 Till date there is no such misfortune 62 rupee ke baraabar ho gaya ek dollar
 Sensex is broken and the common man is thinking what will happen to him
 desh kii arthvyavastha kaa jo haal hua he usase to yahi lagata he ki uskaa kuch nahin ho saktaa
 Because it will happen when someone wants to do it
 philhal sarkaar chunaav ke intazaar ke alaava kuch nahin kar rahi he
 Know the value of 1 dollar Manmohan Babu 1947 - 1 Rupee 1970 - 7
 5 rupaya1980 - 7
 9 rupee 1990 - 17
 9 rupaya1991 - 24
 5 rupees 1996 - 35
 5 rupaya1999 - 42 rupaya2004 - 44 rupaya16 agast 2013 - 62 rupayasawaal kai hai
 For example
 
 
 - kya manmohan-chidabanram kii jodi fail he?- kya desh kii iconomi kaa bantaadhaar isi jodi ne kiya?- kya share bazaar ko is jodi ne hi barbaad kiya?- kya dollars ke mukaable rupaya isi jodi ke vakt barbaad hua?yah aise sawaal hai jo do dashak baad ek baar phir usee khule bazaar ke khel main ubhare hai jise 1991 main shuru bhi manmohan-chidabanram jodi ne kiya or do dashak baad apni hi banaayi iconomi ko sambhaal paane main donon fail sabit ho rahe hai
 It is no coincidence that since independence, the rupee fell against the dollar only when Manmohan Singh was the country's Finance Minister or is the Prime Minister as of today
 1991 main jab manmohan singh vitt mantri bane to 24 rupee ke baraabar ek dollars tha or 1996 main jab manmohan singh ne kursi chodi tab rupaya dollars ke mukaable 35 rupee paar kar chukaa tha
 And when Manmohan Singh became Prime Minister in 2004, the rupee was Rs 44 against one dollar and in 2013 it has reached Rs 62
 share bazaar ke khel main fansaa aam admimanmohan singh ne isi daur main iconomi kaa aadhaar share bazaar ko banaaya or share bazaar ke khel main aam aadmi fansaa or sabakuch ganvaakar khaali haath hua
 It is worth noting that for the first time, Manmohan Singh was the finance minister, while the security scam (also known as the share scam) took place and the first chair was made by Chidambaram on which the Fairgrowth company stood behind the stock market
 Was accused of influencing
 lekin khaas baat yah bhi he ki us vakt manmohan singh ne bataur vitt mantri chidabaram kii vakaalat kii thi or saat maheene ke bheetar chidabanram kaa istipha waapas bhi ho gaya tha
 And today, when the stock market fell by more than 700 points, then Finance Minister Chidambaram cemented India's economy but the stock market experts are seeing scams once again
 agar dhyaan den to jis munaafe ke tantra ko viksit arthvyavastha kaa paimaana manmohan singh ne mana vahi pehali baar gart main ja rahaa he kyonki share bazaar se lekar rupee ko majboot karne ke liye videshi nivesh par hi bharosa kiya gaya
 And at present, foreign investment is not coming because there is neither a stock market nor a corporate or industry on the stock market in case of profit
 or videshi nivesh kaa pehla mantra hi turant munafa kamanaa hota he
 When the international media criticized Manmohan for the entire year, the same world media had declared Prime Minister Manmohan Singh unsuccessful in the world in which Manmohan was known as a well-known economist
 time ne underechiver kaha tha to da indipendent ne kamjor or washington post ne traasadee shabd ko manmohan singh ke saath joda tha
 Moreover, the international credit institution Fitch and Standard Poor's even cut the credit rating by terming Manmohan Singh's economic policy as negative, stable
 sawaal he ki arthshaastri manmohan singh chuke kahaan jo bharat ke anukool arthvyavastha ko raajnneetik vyavastha ke tahat dhaal nahin paye
 Getting discount rate to the corporate sector In fact, if the major basis of mismanagement is to consider foreign investment as the mantra of development, then the government has to bow down to corporate and multinational companies
 manmohan kii iconomi ne kaise desh ke bheetar aarthik khai badhaayi or kaise aam aadmi kii tulana main corporate sector ko chhot dar chhot di yah un aankadon se bhi samajha ja saktaa he jo upie-2 kaa sach he
 Between 2009 and 2012, the corporate sector was given a subsidy of Rs 6,21,890 crore in customs and a rebate of Rs 4,23,294 crore in excise
 or tex main 1,98,789 karod kii chhot de di
 That is, the economists who questioned the subsidy to the common people, never raised any question about the subsidy or rebate given to the corporate or industry
 yah chhot kis had tak di jaati rahi he iskaa andaja 2012-13 main industry se lee gai custom duty or exise main di gai chhot se bhi samajha ja saktaa he
 Alam is that last year the government earned 1,46,000 crore from the custom and gave a discount of 2,76,093 crore
 isi tarah exise main industry ko chhot di 2,12,177 karod kii or kamai kii sirf 1,53,000 karod kii
 That is, the economist Manmohan Singh rejected the infrastructure from which the government should earn and the infrastructure that the government should improve from that earnings
 yani bharat nirmaan kaa naaraa lagane vaale manmohan singh sarkaar kaa sach yah bhi he ki bharat nirmaan ke prachaar prasar par hi beete paanch baras main 35,123 crores kharch kar diye gayi
 At the same time, the government kept on crying about not having money to complete the infrastructures from education to health
 uttar pradesh kii rajdhani lakhanu main ek cancergrast naaballig ladki ke saath gangrape ke maamle main aaj tisare aaropee ko bhi giraftaar kar liya gaya he

 gauratlab he ki shanivaar ko lakhanu ke sarojninagar kii rahane vaali peedita ke saath uski jaan-pahchaan vaale shubham ne apane ek dost ke saath uskaa gangrape kiya
 Shubham had called the victims out of the house on the pretext of eating chowmin
 peedita ghar se choumin khaane kii baat kahkar nikali
 But with the victim who came to eat Choumin, Shubham gang-raped with his friend and escaped leaving him there in bad condition
 iske baad kaa vakya or bhi khaufnak tha
 The victim of the gang rape wandered away, escaping
 usne ek aparichit vyakti se rasta poocha or madad maangi tathaa apane ghar tak pahunchane kii guhaar lagaai
 But that unidentified person, far from talking about helping him, raped himself along with the victim
 peedita kisi tarah kaaphi der baad ghar pahunchi or parivaar waalon ko apni aapbeetee sunai
 The family members reached the Sarojninagar police station late Saturday night and lodged a rape complaint with their 15-year-old daughter
 police ne bataaya ki peedita lakhanu ke sarojninagar ke natkur gaanv kii rahane vaali he
 She is suffering from blood cancer and has been undergoing treatment for many years
 police ne shanivaar ko cese darj kar peedita kaa medical karavaaya, jisamen rape kii pushti hui
 The police started investigating the case and started searching for the accused
 police ne ravivaar ko mukhya aaropee shubham ke dost or raste main rape karne vaale madadgaar ko arest kar liya tha

 The megastar Amitabh Bachchan will appear in a TV program directed by Anurag Kashyap, less than 20 years of age
 amitabh ne apni umr ko kam dikhaane kii prakriya ko 'hasyaprad' or 'asuvidhajanak' bataaya
 Bachchan wrote in his blog that attempts to look 20 years younger than his age for shooting the program are laughable

 sahitya ajtak kaa aaj teesraa or antim din he'sahitya ajtak 2019' shuukravaar (1 november) ko shuru hua thise baar kai bhartiya bhashaaon ko kiya gaya he shamilsahitya kaa sabase bada mahakumbh 'sahitya ajtak 2019' shuukravaar (1 november) ko shuru hua tha
 Today is the third and final day of the program
 tisare din 'sahitya ajtak' ke 'sidhi baat' manch par 'premchand ke baad' seshan main sahitya academy puraskaar vijeta lekhika chitra mudgal or lekhak dow
 Sadanand Shahi expressed his opinion
 is seshan kaa sanchaalan ajtak ke agjicutive editor said ansaari ne kiya
 During this discussion, both the authors kept their words smoothly
 charchaa kii shuruyaat karne se pehle said ne donon atithiyon kaa parichay karaayaa
 After this, Saeed said, starting the discussion that after Premchand, how do you see the world of literature from then till today
 premchand nahin hai phir bhi premchand hainchitra mudgal ne kaha ki mujhe lagata he ki premchand ke baad 30-40 saalon tak unka prabhaav sahitya par rahaa
 i think the renaissance of Bengal did not affect Bharatendu alone
 premchand ne srujanaatmakataa ko ek activism main badalane kii koshish kii
 In his works, he chose all the topics like hypocrisy, hypocrisy in Indian society
 in sab vishyon ko unhone srujanaatmakataa ke madhyam se logon ke saamne rakhaa
 These things got off in the people and they felt that this is our point
 godaan ke baad unka jivan bahut kam bachaa
 But we find that Premchand kept giving direction to Hindi literature for 40 years
 isi ke saath unhone premchand kii teen kahaniyon kaa udhaaharan dekar yah bhi bataaya ki premchand kii kahaniyaan aaj bhi hamen sandesh dete hai
 In the end, he said that Premchand is not yet Premchand

 Prem Chand, author of Samagra India
 sadanand shahi ne apni raay rakhte hue kaha ki premchand ek samagrata ke lekhak hai
 Is the author of Holistic Indian life
 premchand ne hindi kii upanyaas kii paribhaasha ko badal dete hai, kahani kii paribhaasha ko badal dete hai
 We have always read that India is an agricultural country, but its unique information comes from the literature of Premchand that India is an agricultural country
 premchand ne upanyaas ko madhya varg ke mahakavy ke bajaay kisaanon ke mahakavy ke taur par pesh kiya
 The female problem has been talked about for the last three decades
 lekin premchand kaa jo pehla upanyaas aayaa seva sadan 1918 main, ittifaq se us upanyaas ke 100 saal bhi puure ho gaye hai, wo pehla upanyaas hi stri samasya se judaa hua he
 Premchand brilliantly showed what is the backwardness of our society and also showed the feeling towards the woman in the society
 premchand vahaan ungali rakhte hai jahaan sudhaar kii jarurat he
 So i think Premchand is the author of Samagra Bharat
 balak kahani kii badi sundar vyakhya chitra ji ne kii
 i am dissatisfied with the imperative of the new generation: Chitra Mudgalsaid further asked a question that in the view of the present day litterateur, the market is more, the urge to improve society is over or the tune of changing society is still there
 chitra mudgal ne jawaab dete hue kaha mujhe lagata he ki bazaar lekhak ke manas par dabaav banaae hue he, or agar dabaav bana hua he to acchhee baat he
 Today, in the changed circumstances, the new transitions that are flourishing, i see here that the transitions have changed in front of the new writer
 kal jo apwaad tha wo aaj ghar-ghar kii kahani he
 Our new writers are aware, i find girls ahead in this
 aaj lekhan sangharsh kar rahaa he
 i am very satisfied with the new generation
 ve apana rasta bana rahe hai
 But i am dissatisfied with his impatience
 sahitya ajtak 2019 main shaamil le rahe atithiyon kii list dekhne ke liye yahaan clic karen
 
 
 
 premchand aaj bhi hamen shikshit karte hai: dow
 Sadanand Shahi Daw
 sadanand shahi ne is bare main aage kaha bhashaa ke vishay par jarur vichaar karnaa chahie
 Looking at the context of the language, Hindi was still being formed at that time and an attempt was being made to convert it into Panditaun Hindi
 premchand aaj bhi bhashaa ke maamle main hamen shikshit karte rahete hai
 He further said that there is a lot of confusion about the language
 sanchaar madhyamon par jo hindi boli ja rahi he vah hamaare prakruti kii hindi nahin he
 Hindi is corrupted in syntax and Hindi is corrupt there
 jo hindi janapadiya bhashaa se judake samrudh ho rahi he vahaan use bhrasht kahana galat hoga
 Today, if language is to be corrected, then Premchand's language should be read once again

 According to the Chief Minister of Bihar, there is no option but to ban liquor
 supreme court ke aadesh ke anusaar haive ke paanch sau meter ke daayre main sharaab kii duukaan par pratibandh ke aadesh ke baavjood uskaa rasta nikaalane main rajya sarkarein hi madad kar rahi hai
 Nitish Kumar says that there is no way out other than prohibition
 jab tak rajyon main purna sharabbandi lagu nahin hoti tab tak koi na koi rasta nikalataa rahata he
 Nitish believes that liquor prohibition has affected many states in Bihar
 koi rajya dukaane kam kholane kii koshish kar rahi he to koi sarkari dukaan se sharaab bechney kii taiyaari kar rahi he
 The Supreme Court decided that the liquor should be stopped on the highway, but people are moving the shop inside
 ye koi rasta nahin he, puri tarah band karnaa hi sahi hoga
 Nitish Kumar said that liquor ban does not harm the state's revenue either
 bihar kaa rajasav jitna 15-16 main tha lagbhag utana hi 16-17 main bhi he
 During this time there was no ban on liquor ban in the state
 notebandi kaa sabase zyada asar registry offis par padaa
 Despite this, it is a big deal to get the same revenue

 Chief Minister Nitish Kumar said that we advise all Chief Ministers to implement complete prohibition in the state
 yah ek samaajik kranti he, bada kadam he, himmat kii baat he
 He said that he had advised the then Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav about prohibition of liquor in Uttar Pradesh and would now advise the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh to implement full prohibition in his state

 And then increased his awe several times from his coverage

 gandhi nishthavan, sanatani hindu the
 Every moment of Gandhi's life, religion, politics, contemplation, freedom struggle or anywhere, his religion was hidden from religion
 usee se prerit-nirdeshit tha
 They had no religion or nothing beyond religion
 gandhi kaa yah dharm, unke vyaktigat jivan main asandigdh rup se hindu tha or anya duusare dharmon ke prati puri tarah sahishnu or vineet tha
 The 'god' of this religion, its 'spirituality', 'soul' and 'morality' were determined by their own fabricated or chosen definitions
 unki vyaktigat jivan style or aacharan se paribhaashit hoti thi
 The early rites of Gandhi's life were made up of the five sources of Jainism, Ahimsa, Astaya, Satya, Aparigraha and Brahmacharya
 gandhi kamobesh inhen apane jivan main, apane karm or darshan main hameshaa utaarne kii koshish karte rahe
 Gandhi's form of religious Hindu was so clear that everyone in the country considered him 'hindu' without any doubt
 muslim lig or jinna unhen hameshaa sirf hindu maanate rahe
 The communists always considered him a communal Hindu
 ambedkar unhen bura savarna hindu maanate the
 By the time Gandhi started his first major political battle in 1920, he was also a part of the nation's traditional and staunch Hindus, aspiring for nationalism, freedom struggle and freedom from British rule, as well as the savior of his Hindu faith and Hindu They had also become a symbol of the revival of religion
 nirad si
 Chaudhary mentions an interesting episode in his autobiography
 1921 kii shuruyaat main ek din ve kishorganj (bengal) ke ek talab main nahaane gaye
 "there was also a Brahmin in the crowd of bathing men who had been mumbling / chanting folk, washing their janeu
 usee ke paas nahaate hue kuch log gandhi ke andolan kii baat kah rahe the
 i also joined them
 achaanak ek sookhe hue, buudhe praani ne apni chamakati ankhon se mujhe dekha or aisi aawaaj main, jo apni dharmandhta, karkashta or anand main dubi thi, kaha vah (gandhi) hinduvad ko punarsthapit karne aayaa he
 "gandhi himself, too, announced in Young India on October 12, 1921:" i call myself a Sanatani Hindu because 1
 main vedon, upanishdon, puraanon or samast hindu shastron main vishwaas karata hum or isiilie avtaron or punarjanmon main bhi meraa vishwaas he
 2
 main varnashram dharm main vishwaas karata hum
 i consider it in a sense that is completely agreeable to the Vedas but does not accept its present prevailing and vulgar form
 3
 i believe in protecting the cow in a much broader sense than prevailing
 4
 i do not believe in idolatry
 par baavjood is sabake, gandhi kaa yah hindu dharm yaa unka hindutv, desh ke tatkaaleen pramukh hindu sanghathanon, 'hindu mahasabha' or 'rashtriya swanyasevak sangh' ke hindutv se puri tarah alag tha
 The main or the ultimate goal of these Hindu organizations was the establishment of 'hindu India'
 gandhi ke vichaaron, karm or uddeshyon main 'hindu bharat' kabhi nahin rahaa
 The Quranic text was used in Gandhi's prayer meetings
 bible or gita unke liye baraabar kaa mahatv rakhti thim
 Gandhi's India, rather than Hindu India, was an India that encompassed all religions, systems of life, practices, customs and customs of the country with equality at all levels
 hindu sanghathan gandhi ke is bharat ko asweekaar karte the
 He had some of his own blurred, vague interpretations of 'hindu India'
 ye vyaavhaarikta kii jameen par kabhi parkhi hi nahin gayi thim
 His dream of 'hindu India', with inadequate or incomplete or apolitical history, always wandered in the realities
 kamobesh usee tarah, jis tarah pakistan ke samarthakon or jinna ke paas, vibhaajan tak bhi pakistan ke sampurna dhaanche, swaroop, bhavishya aadi par koi spashtataa nahin thi
 The Hinduism of these Hindu organizations was born out of the greatness and pride of Hinduism and Hindu culture, which inspired it, its last universal state had ended about one and a half thousand years ago
 baad ke samay main, duusari sahasrabdi ke aasapaas ek nayaa, videshi or apane aapmen behad majboot dharm 'islam', is desh main aayaa
 It spread very rapidly in a large part of the world
 yah dharm anek rajnatik vishmataaon se to bharaa hi tha, apane mul islamic chintan or dharmikata se bhi puri tarah bhatka hua tha
 But with political power in hand, he increased his control and influence here
 islam ke lagbhag paanch sau varshon ke shashan ke baad, phir ek or nae, bahari or utane hi behad majboot dharm, 'isai dharm' ne desh kii simaaon main pravesh kiya
 Unlike the anomalous and wandering form of Islam, it was the religion of a well-developed, developed and economically thriving civilization
 viksit isliye, ki isamen navajagaran lagbhag chaar sau saal pehle shuru ho gaya tha
 Social, industrial, political revolutions had taken place in this
 shiksha kaa aadharbhoot chintan viksit ho chukaa tha
 All the outer and inner structures of this religion were extremely strong
 england main is dharm kii aisi vishaal rajnatik satta thi, jo aadha vishwa niyantrit karti thi
 It had science, capital, modern weapons, knowledge, new consciousness and courage
 isane desh main 'hindu' or 'islam', donon dharmon ke samaajon, unke rajnatik or aarthik dhaanchon ko prabhavit yaa chhin-bhinn karnaa shuru kar diya
 1857 AD main bharat main east india company or mughal samrajya, donon samaapt ho gaye
 By that time, many new ideas, new beliefs, new movements had been born and were spreading in the world
 ye dharm kii jadta, rudhigat saamaajik dhaanche, varchasvvaadi raajnneeti se alag the
 They were inspired by the struggles for human equality, equal rights and new social consciousness and economic equality
 ye vichaar or andolan 'dharm kii satta' se alag 'manushya kii satta' par kendrit the
 By this time, the religious nation was considered an extremely backward, anti-human, exploitative concept
 bharat bhi inase achoota yaa alag nahin tha
 The labor movement, the struggle for the upliftment of Dalits and the oppressed, modern education, democracy, industrialization, scientific inventions, international contacts, etc
, made the concept or idea of any kind of religious nation completely irrelevant or futile even in India
 gandhi or unke saath ke netaa in tamaam sachchaaiyon ko samajhate the
 They knew and understood their country
 isaki bunaavat, itihaas, isaki shakti ke aadhaar ko samajhate the
 Gandhi knew that the diversity of the country is its life
 is vividhta main ekta kaa hona or use apane saath le chalanaa hi swatantraaa sangharsh kii buniyaad he
 There is no other way to fight this freedom and gain freedom from it, except to carry this diversity together and to build a future India in it
 isiilie gandhi ke sapanom ke bharat kaa swaroop kabhi hindu nahi rahaa
 He was never a supporter of Hindu Rashtra
 unka hindutv kabhi gaiyr hindu dharmon ke prati aakraamak yaa hinsak nahin hua
 At that time any slightly conscious, sensitive liberal person could clearly see the ideological boundaries, and inconsistencies of the spokesmen of the 'hindu Rashtra' or its warriors
 hindu bharat ke pairokaron ke saamne kuch spasht or vaastavik chunautiyaan thim jinase sidhe muthbhed karne se ve bachate the
 Probably because they could not conquer them
 unke saamne pehali or sabase badi chunauti, desh kii hajaaron saal puraani shoshak or amanviya jati vyavastha thi
 The emergence of thoughts and feelings of Hindu organizations was entirely concentrated among the upper castes
 is hindu ubhaar ke dwaara saikadon saalon baad ek baar phir bharat kaa ucch varna musalamaanon ke shashan main apni khoi yaa nishprabhavi ho chuki asmita, varchasv or apane ateet ke gaurav ko paane kii sambhaavnaaon ko talash rahaa tha
 It is interesting that in comparison to these, the struggle of the Dalits for their upliftment was also active
 unki asmita or saamaajik chetana or adhikaron kii ladaai shuru ho chuki thi
 They were awake and organized
 desh kii raajnneeti main ve ek badi shakti ke rup main jagah bana rahe the
 In the democratic process, they were slowly coming down
 unke matdaan kaa adhikaar, unhen desh kii rajnatik vyavastha main mahatvapurn paksh, balki ek had tak nirnaayak paksh ke rup main jagah de rahaa tha
 After Phule, Ambedkar was the most staunch and fierce opponent of this upper caste Hinduism
 unke vyaktigat or sampurna rajnatik jivan kaa ekmaatr lakshya, ucch varna ke hinduon dwaara nirmit is shoshak or damankaaree jati vyavastha ko khatm karnaa tha
 Apparently, the first biggest challenge before the spokesmen or upper castes of Hindu India was the Dalits being crushed in the caste system for hundreds of years
 ye unhen sweekaar nahin kar rahe the
 When Ambedkar announced his conversion in 1935, the entire upper-caste Hindu society became restless
 daliton ko hinduon ke saath gina jaataa tha
 Their number kept the Hindu majority
 unke alag hone par hindu apana bahusankhyak hone kaa daawa kho detaa tha
 At that time, Ambedkar also left open the possibility of accepting Christianity or Islam for himself
 jaahir tha, desh kii ek bahut badi sankhya kaa is tarah isai yaa islam dharm main dharmantarit ho janaa, bhavishya ke kisi 'hindu bharat' ke saamaajik or rajnatik swaroop ke liye bada aghat tha
 An attempt was made to persuade and convince Ambedkar
 saavarkar or munje se is sambandh main ambedkar kaa lanbaa patr vyavhaar bhi hua tha
 Gandhi was also restless
 puure ghatnakram ko satarkta se dekh rahe the
 The 'poona Pact' was the result of this uneasiness of Gandhi
 baad main harijan andolan ke rup main unhone daliton ko hinduon or congress se chhitak kar tut jane se roka tha
 The second major challenge before Hindu organizations was that they were not able to attract people of other classes, sects and religions, apart from middle or upper middle class Hindus, towards their style and objectives
 musalmaan, isai, dalit to hindu sanghathanon se alag the hi, par in hindu sanghathanon dwaara hindu dharm kii chhatari main jain, buddha or sikhon ko sthaan or manyata dene ke baad bhi, in dharmon ke logon par unka prabhaav naganya rahaa
 He was not interested in any such concept of 'hindu Rashtra' or 'hindu India' or in the struggle to realize it
 hindu sanghathanon ke saamne teesri badi chunauti hindu dharm ke anek, vividhtapurna or antarvirodhon se bhare up dharm, unki mul avadharanaen, vyakhyaayein, siddhant or karmkand the
 Like Christianity or Islam religion in its base, Hinduism was not a book and a religion of a god
 apane anek vikhandit swaroopon main, anek up dharmon or virgon ke kaaran, hinduon ke paas ek tarah kii jivan style jeene vaala ek samaan hindu samaaj bhi nahin tha
 Like oranges, there were many pieces inside it
 in sabake alaava hindu sanghathanon ko apane liye bahut nikat ke ek mahaan or bhavy ateet kii talash thi
 But as the Gupta Empire it was destroyed one and a half thousand years ago
 isliye baad main parajiton ko nayak bana kar ek nishprabhavi hindu rashtrawaad or hinduon kaa mahaan itihaas gande kii unki vyarth kii cheshtaaen thim
 They had no strong universal 'model' of the past as the Europeans had in Rome or Greece
 nikat kaa ek viksit or jeevant ateet na hone ke kaaran, hindu sanghathanon ke hindu raashtra kii pariklpana swayan main bahut pichhadi, simit or kisi bhi tarah kii aadhunik chetana se rahit ho jaati thi
 Even if we leave the past, this hypothesis was completely incapable of forging a universal, unified, modern, progressive India in future
 vaise bhi, bharat ke itihaas main koi bhi vrihad saarvbhaum hindu raja yaa rajya, sirf 'hindu bharat' kii baat kah kar viksit nahin hua tha
 He never kept his form of Hinduism alone
 isliye ki hinduon main 'dharm' or 'raashtra' sadaiv do alag, swatantra or samanaantar sattaaon ke rup main dekhe gaye the
 Their division of religion and nation was different from Christian or Islamic kingdoms
 vahaan dharm or rajya saikadon varshon tak ekarup rahe
 Apart from this, there has been a personal religion of Hindu kings in the history of India, but there is no declared state religion in general, where "national war" and "crusade" merge into each other
 ashok, pushyamitra, kanishka, gupt vansh, vijay nagar samrajya aadi milenge jinka vyaktigat dharm or rujhaan spasht tha, par vah raashtra kaa bhi dharm tha yaa vah koi dharmik bharat tha, aisa ghoshit rup se tab bhi nahin milegaa
 The splendor of Ajanta or Nalanda was when 'param Bhagwat' was the golden age of 'avatarism' in the temples of the Guptas
 hindu saamaajik sanrachana or samskruti main, raashtra kii avadharana kabhi dharm se jud kar ghoshit nahin hui, jaisi ki isai or islam, do bade dharmon ke bade samrajyon kii rahi thi
 This Hinduism had its own distinct or distinct type of greatness, greatness, generosity and tolerance, which was rare in other religions of the world
 samasya yahi thi ki desh ke hindu sanghathan bharat desh or hindu dharm, donon kii hi is sachai ko nakaar rahe the
 Their cultural nationalism was tying 'dharma' and 'rashtra' into a knot
 nattejey main jo 'hindu' nahin the, unako 'anya' kii tarah dekha ja rahaa tha
 Their separate 'piety' was being given hostility
 bharat kii vividhta main ekta ke praantatv ke liye yah ek ghaatak soch thi
 Gandhi understood all this, so he had completely differentiated his definition of Hindu from 'hindu organizations'
 gandhi kaa lakshya samaaj kaa sabase garib, kamjor dikhataa antim manushya tha, na ki kisi 'hindu raashtra' kii sthapana karnaa
 The happiness and sorrow of this weak man was his concern
 desh kii saajha samskruti thi
 There was a shared history
 isaki vividhta kaa sangrakshan or swatantraaa thi, isliye ve kabhi 'hindu bharat' kii baat nahin karte the
 On the contrary, by supporting and favoring the Muslims, they became the biggest enemies of these organizations and eventually the 'sanatani Hindu' Gandhi had to be killed by a staunch Hindu
 gandhi ne janvari 1948 main dilli kaa anshan todgaye kii jo sharten rakhi thim, ve sab musalamaanon ke liye or unke paksh main thim
 "" Before January 1948, Hindu organizations had little problem with Gandhi
 gandhi 16 sitambar, 1947 ko dilli main rashtriya swayamsevak sangh kii ek sabha main gaye the
 The descriptions of Pyarelal and Brajakrishna Chandiwala suggest that by that time Gandhi and the Sangh had a smooth and normal relationship, despite mutual doctrinal disagreements and conflicting forms of functioning
 sabha main jo hua or gandhi ne jo kaha, uske praasangik ansh dekhte haih''sabha shuru hone se pehle jhanda salaami hui
 After that Basantrao Oak, the head of 500 volunteers, said: 'the purpose of the Sangh is to protect it by following the principles of Hinduism that produces a great person like you
 desh, dharm or samskruti kii raksha hi hamaara ekmaatr dhyey he
 Regardless of any kind of vaccine, we are done
 "dhyaan den ki is samay tak sangh main gandhi kii hindu chhavi asandigdh thi
 He had no complaint with Gandhi
 gandhi ne kaha
 
 
 "hindus are more in the Indian Union
 isamen koi shame kii baat nahin
 But if we say that apart from Hindus, no one else can live here and no one can, then he has to remain a slave of Hindus, then it is wrong
 hindu dharm aisa nahin sikhaata
 All religions are included in my Hinduism
 sab dharmon kaa nichod hindu dharm main miltaa he
 If Hinduism did not work to digest everyone, it would not have risen that high
 sab dharmon main utaar-chadhaav to aata hi he
 Ever since untouchability got a place in Hinduism, we started falling
 isse hamen kitna nuksaan hua, use main yahaan nahin bataaungaa
 If we say that all of Hindus except Hindus have to remain slaves, or Pakistanis should say that except Muslims in Pakistan everyone should remain slaves, then this thing will not work
 aisa kahkar donon apana dharm chhodte hai or apane-apane dharm kaa naash karte hai
 ''
 
 
 mujhase kaha jaataa he ki aap musalmaan ke dost hai or hindu or sikhon ke dushman
 i have been a friend of Muslims since the age of 12 and i am still today
 lekin jo mujhe hinduon or sikhon kaa dushman kehete hai, ve mujhe pahachaanate nahin
 Hinduism is embedded in my mind
 main dharm ko jis tarah samajhataa hum, usee tarah uski or hindustan kii seva puri takat se kar rahaa hum
 i have told you about my heart
 hindustan kii raksha kaa, uski unnati kaa yah rasta nahin ki jo buraai pakistan main hui uskaa ham anukaran karen
 We only follow goodness
 "gandhi ne kaha
 
 
 "your number is large
 aapaki takat hindustan kii barabaadi main lage, to vah buree baat hogi
 i do not know if there is any truth in the charge that is levied on you
 maine to sirf bataa diya ki kisi cheez kaa nateeja kya ho saktaa he
 It is the work of the Sangh to prove this charge a lie by its right deeds
 "sambhawatah sangh ke logon se gandhi kaa yah sidhaa or antim samvaad he
 This in itself is very clear
 isamen headgavar or golwalkar ke prati gandhi ke vichaar milte hai
 In the speech Gandhi clearly condemns the anti-muslim activities of the Sangh but praises the Sangh's discipline etc
 gandhi uski bahut-si baton se asahmati jataate chalate hai
 Gandhi, on the basis of his interpretation of Hinduism, explains to him in a clear, polite and specific way, in very clear terms, that 'hinduism' does not allow that non-hindus in India have to remain slaves of Hindus
 yah dekhnaa rochak he ki apane jivan se to gandhi ne hindu sanghathanon kaa prabhaav badaae ko to roka hi, par usase adhik apni mrityu se roka
 The assassination of Godse by Gandhi immediately ended any possibility of India becoming a 'hindu India'
 yah teen tareekon se hua
 The first is that public opinion turned against Hindu organizations
 unka rashtrawaad, unka saanskrithik gaurav, unka hindu raashtra kaa lakshya jo unka aadhaar tha, ek hinsak sanghathan ke rup main centre main aa gaya
 About 80 per cent of the people of Hindu organizations themselves were against killing Gandhi in this way
 doosraa yah ki swayan sardaar patel ke andar is sanghathan ke anushaasan, rashtravaadi swar or nishtha ke liye jo thodi bahut sahanubhuti thi, or jiske sadasyon ko ve 'anushaasit, par 'bhatke hue deshbhakt' maanate the, vah bhaavana samaapt ho gai
 After Gandhi's assassination, he harshly repressed them
 sangh ko pratibandhit kar diya
 Golwalkar was jailed
 shyama prasad mukarji ko chhod kar hindu mahasabha kii puri kaaryakarini giraftaar kar lee gai
 After this, the Hindu Mahasabha was often dead
 sangh bhi nepathy main chalaa gaya
 He returned to the public stage
 pi
 Returned at the time of the movement when he supported the student movement
 baad main apatkaal kaa virodh kiya
 This protest once again reinforced his nationalist image
 is virodh ke baad hi, vah us nakaaratmak chhavi se mukt ho sakaa jo gandhi kii hatya ke baad ek aam naagarik ke man main uske liye ban gai thi
 Third, the right-wing faction within the Congress and which had sympathized and reconciled with Hindu organizations from the very beginning, had its tone completely weakened or weakened within the Congress
 kul milakar gandhi ne apni hatya se anayas hi desh ke kisi bhi tarah ke hinduvaadi swaroop kii taraf jhukne kii sambhaavnaaon ko bahut lambey samay ke liye yaa lagbhag puri tarah khatm kar diya
 Religious nation is an inevitable evil
 hamen bhoolanaa nahin chahie ki pakistan ek dharmik raashtra bana tha
 The basis of his creation was just 'religion'
 ek 'islamic desh' ke rup main janm lene ke baad aaj ham uskaa parinaam dekh rahe hai
 After independence, India did not choose the path of a religious nation
 vah loktantric, aadhunik, pragatisheel, dharmanirpeksh or vividhta main ekta par vishwaas karne vaale raashtra ke rup main aage badha
 Gandhi understood the importance of this, Nehru understood, Ambedkar understood, Patel understood, Maulana Azad, Left and Socialist
 udaaravaadi sahishnu hindu samajhate the
 That is why India continued to develop rapidly
 dharmik rashtron kaa rasta hameshaa ek andhi gupha main khatm hota he
 It is very easy to see and test this truth
 duniya ke kisi dharmik raashtra ne manushyata ke hit main, vikaas main, vigyaan main koi sahyog nahin diya
 It is a matter of sadness and worry that the main voice of our time is the same again
 phir 'hindu bharat' kii fusfusaahaten hai, 'anya' ko shatru banane kaa unmaad he
 There are thoughts and efforts to eliminate its diversity
 gandhi kii dedh sauveen jayanti hamen avasar detii he ki ham gandhi ke jivan, karm or dharm par vichaar karen or is paksh ko vishesh rup se dekhen ki unka 'sanatani hindu' kis tarah bharat ko uski samagrata main dekhtaa or sweekaar karata tha
 Gandhi's 'hindutva' did not intimidate other religions
 gandhi kaa 'raamarajy' ek utapia ke rup main abhivyakt hota tha, na ki hinsak, aakraamak tareeke se ayodhya main ram kii pratishtha karne ke liye
 Gandhi's 'hindutva' was not about ritualistic, preaching, frenzied devotion but spirituality
 maanviyata, udaartaa or naitikta kii sarhadon main pravesh karata hua tha
 Gandhi's 'hindutva' encompassed the other, not the secularism that surrounded it
 gandhi kaa 'hindutv' dharm kii usee praan vaayu se janma tha jo duniya ke samast dharmon ke janm or astitv kaa vaastavik mul he
 It had compassion, generosity, tolerance, love and respect for other religions, not to challenge and destroy them in violent and hysterical language
 gandhi kaa 'hindutv' swatantraaa kii ladaai main isiilie sabko apane saath jod sakaa tha
 Consistent with the diversity of the country, it was able to take forward the fight for independence
 gandhi ne dakshin africa main nasl bhed, rang bhed ke khilaaf ladaai ladi
 Farmers in Champaran in India, laborers in Ahmedabad and Muslims joined the fight in the non-cooperation Movement
 apane 'hindutv' ko in sabake bich adhik vyapak, sweekrut, maanviya or prabhavi banaaya
 If we understand and accept or accept Gandhi's' Hindu 'and' Hindutva 'in the true sense of today's Hinduist organizations' definitions of Hindutva and the possibilities or repercussions of the fatal consequences of its disruptive nature, then Gandhi's one and a half His remembrance on the hundredth birth anniversary will be truly meaningful, relevant and beneficial for both us and the country

 There is an uproar in Delhi over the Jan Lokpal bill
 pehle mudda tha ki dilli sarkaar jan lokapal bill kyon nahin laa rahi he or ab hangaamaa is baat par he ki sarkaar ne itani hai-tauba main cabinet bulaakar janalokapal bill ko manjuuri de di
 Allegations are being made that Kejriwal government's intention is not to bring Janlokpal, he just wants to show off the bill in the assembly
 kejariwal sarkarajnalokapal bill ko vidhansabha main pesh karne ke liye taiyaar he or aam aadmi party iske liye apane aap ko shaabaashi dete nahin thak rahi
 The party claims that this bill will be the same, which was approved by Anna, but the opposition has raised questions about the government's intention
 congress netaa ajay maakan ne kaha he ki agar sarkaar ke paas pehle se bill taiyaar tha, to use manjuuri dene ke liye aanan-fanan main cabinet bulaane kii zarurat kyon padi
 Congress President Mudan Niladhili Congress President Maken said, 'I have a copy of the bill of February 2014, if it is the same bill, then the government has not completed the process of introducing it for eight months
 agar is main badlaav kiya gaya he to sarkaar chup kyon he
 'are Kejriwal government really confused? Opposition is accusing the government of pretending to bring Janlokpal bill under pressure
 isaki vajah bhi he, kyonki buudhvaar ko jab dilli vidhansabha kaa satr shuru hua, to vidhansabha ke bheetar bijepi ne janalokapal nahin laane ko lekar sawaal khadaa kiya tha, to vidhansabha ke bheetar congress nejanalokapalpesh karne ke liye jabardast virodh pradarshan kiya tha
 That is why BJP is now alleging that the Kejriwal government is in a dilemma about the Jan Lokpal law
 netaa vipaksh ne kaha prakriya fansaana chaahati he sarkaradilli vidhansabha main vipaksh ke netaa vijendra gupta ne kaha, 'pehle aapane kaha ki dilli lokayukta bill main sanshodhan karenge, phir aapane do saal se khaali pade lokayukta ke pad ko puraane kanoon se hi bhar diya
 Now saying that Anna will bring the bill
 darasal sarkaar kii taiyaari hi nahin he or wo ise kanoonee prakriya main fansaana chaahati he
 The opposition raised this question, the opposition alleges that the government is withdrawing from its own promises regarding the Jan Lokpal law
 isiilie usne bill ko lekar sthiti pehle se spasht nahin kii he
 If the bill was ready, why not fulfill the constitutional formalities required for it beforehand
 agar yah vahi bill he jise 49 dinon ke kaarykaal ke dauraan pesh kiya gaya, to phir bill ke praavdhaanon ko lekar sarkaar spasht kyon nahin he
 If the intention of the government is really to get the bill passed, then why was it not sent to the Lieutenant Governor and Center for approval as per the rule
 kyonki janalokapal bill vittiya praavdhaanon se juda he
 If the changes were not made according to the Lokpal bill of the Center, then will this bill not become another excuse for confrontation with the Center
 ham majboot lokapal laa rahe hai: sarkaradilli sarkaar kii daleel he ki abhi bill kaa masauda hi vipaksh ko nahin pataa he, isiilie unka virodh mahaj ek shor hi he
 Satyendar Jain, a minister in the Delhi government, said, 'now what is in the bill, is anyone aware of it, who are talking different kinds of things
 ham ek majboot janalokapal laa rahe hai, or ise vidhansabha main pesh hone dijie

 bijepi netaa kaaphi koshishen karke bhi congressi vidhayakon ko saadhane main fail hote najar aa rahe hai
 Explain that out of 221 seats, BJP has 104 seats, Congress 78, JDS 36 and others have 3 seats
 jabaki bahumat ke liye 111 vidhayakon kii aavashyaktaa he
 The BJP has to merge Congress and JDS mlas with itself to garner the magic figure
 congress ne bijepi se apane vidhayakon ko bachaane ke liye shuru se hi taiyaari kar rakhi thi
 The Congress got its legislators signed within 24 hours after the results
 iske baad sabhi vidhayakon ko apane nigaraanee main rakhaa
 DK Shivakumar took the command of the mlas from the Congress to save the BJP from going to the court
 unhone pehle vidhayakon ko apane resort main rakhaa
 On the night of BS Yeddyurappa's swearing in as Chief Minister, the Congress took its mlas to Hyderabad by bus
 vahiin dilli main baithe congressi netaaon ne supreme court main dastak dekar maamle ko kanoonee ladaai main tabdeel kar diya
 Subsequently, the Supreme Court fixed 24 hours for Yeddyurappa to prove his majority
 congress ne apane vidhayakon ko hyderabad se duusare din hi bengalooru waapas lekar ai
 Congress leaders kept a close watch on their mlas
 dike sivakumar ne vidhayakon ko sadan main le jane se pehle class lee or kaha ki koi bhi vidhayak kisi bhi bijepi netaa koi baatcheet nahin karegaa
 Not only this, no one has to react to the provocation of the BJP leader nor fight them
 sadan kii kaarywahi shuru hone ke ain vakt par congressi vidhayakon ko vidhansabha pahunche
 Congress leaders were already ordered not to leave the assembly if the house is adjourned
 sadan main hi rahanaa he
 Due to this, when the legislators adjourned the house for two hours after the oath of legislators, the Congress mlas were not allowed to leave
 unki jagah par hi unhen khaane ke packet uplabdh karaae gaye
 Under this strategy of Congress, BJP could not even contact Congress mlas
 isi kaa nateeja tha ki congress kheme se gaayab vidhayak pratap gauda patil or anand singh vaapis sadan main aa gaye
 After this, the Congress leaders fed him food under his supervision and seated himself

 The victory in Australia, the success in the Asiad and Commonwealth Games seems to be going on, but there are some hockey fans who have not lost their cool
 bhubaneshwar ke kalinga stadium main chal rahi champions trophy ko dekhne ke liye ye sabhi phans duniya ke alag-alag kone se ikattha hue hai or behad khaas hai
 He has high expectations from the Indian team, despite India losing two consecutive matches in the tournament
 kareeb 60 saal ke baldev singh kalsi british airways main bataur ejeeniyar kaam karte hai, lekin apni pehali pahchaan vah hockey fain ke taur par hi karwaanaa chaahate hai
 Actually hockey flows in his blood
 varsh 1972 main hue munich olympics se lekar ab tak sabhi olympics khelon main stadium jaakar vah bhartiya team kaa hausala badhaate rahe hai
 For him, the memory of India's victory in the 1975 World Cup is still fresh
 vah bataate hai ki kaise unhone surajeet or ashok kumaar ke gol kaa jashn manaaya tha, or phir baar-baar us jeet kaa jashn manaate rahe hai
 Baldev recalls the memories of India's victory in the 2003 Champions Trophy against Pakistan in Amsterdam
 us toornament main jugraj singh, gaganajit singh, deepak thakur or prabhjot ke gol kii yaad bhi tazaa kar dete hai
 Baldev also has great expectations from the current team's captains, especially he does not get tired of praising players like Sardar Singh, Sreejesh and Dharamvir

 He explains that India won the bronze by defeating Holland 2–1

 He is particularly impressed by the fitness and talent of the current team

 This time, Hockey India has given them guest status during the Champions Trophy being held in Bhubaneswar

 The country's first 'white Tiger Safari' is going to be established in Madhya Pradesh where not only the white tigers will be the center of tourist attraction but they will also get complete information about the history of white tigers
 is safari main paryatakon or vanyajeev premiyon ko vishwa ke pehle safed baagh mohan ke vashanjon ko dekhne kaa mauka milegaa
 Madhya Pradesh Public Relations and Minerals Minister Rajendra Shukla claimed that it was the world's first 'white Tiger Safari' and said that its construction is now nearing completion
 satna jile ke mukundpur kaa yah jiyological park paryatakon ko safed baaghon kii duniya se parichit karavaayega
 Shukla informed that this safari will be named as 'mukundpur Zoo and Mohan Tiger Safari'
 yahaan sthit white tiger prajnan centre kaa naam maharaja martand singh ke naam par rakhaa jayega or safed baaghon ke liye ek upachaar centre bhi sthapit kiya jayega
 It is worth mentioning here that the world's first white tiger (white Tiger) was caught in the forests of Sidhi in 1951 by the then Maharaja Martand Singh and was brought to Govindgarh from where he fled to the forests of Mukundpur
 dhire dhire isi mohan naamak safed baagh ke vashanj duniyabar ke jangalon or chidyagharon tak pahunch gaye
 But they were endangered in Rewa and Vindhya region
 lekin ab jald hi safed baagh apane mul prajnan kshetra main lautega
 While visiting Mukandpur Tiger Safari, Shukla said that tourists will also get complete information about the history of white lion and once again the old tigers in Vindhya region will be brought back to their original habitat and establish an old global identity
 shukla ne bataaya ki lagbhag 40 varsh baad mukundpur vanya jeev paryaton kendra ke taur par viksit ho rahaa he jahaan jiyological park, rescue centre, white tiger safari or prajnan centre aadi hai
 Earlier this area has been known as a conservation and breeding center for white tigers
 unhone kaha ki yah kshetra phir se apane khoe gaurav ko praapt karegaa tathaa vishwa paryaton maanchitr par apni pahchaan banayega
 He hoped that this would not only bring a large number of tourists to the area to see the tiger safari, but the name of Rewa would also emerge on the world tourism map and the local people would also get employment opportunities

 The opposition also played a big role in getting the Triple Talaq Bill passed in the Rajya Sabha, if it is said then there will be nothing wrong in it
 sutron ke anusaar, vipaksh ke 20 saansad voting ke dauraan rajyasabha se anupasthit rahe
 Because of this the majority figure fell to less than 121
 aurayah bill paas ho gaya
 After the bill is passed, opposition parties are now asking their mps to give reasons
 congress ne apane rajyasabha sadasyon se poocha he ki aakhir party dwaara vip jari karne ke baad bhi sadsy sadan main upasthit kyon nahin rahe
 Explain that the Modi government passed the 'muslim Women (protection of Marriage Rights) Bill, 2019' by 99 votes against 84 in the Rajya Sabha
 sutron ne bataaya ki vipaksh ke sadsy agar sadan main maujuud hote to vah vidheyak ko pravar samiti ke paas bhijwa saktaa tha
 The five Congress members who were absent were Vivek Tankha, Pratap Singh Bajwa, Mukut Mithi and Ranjib Biswal, besides Sanjay Singh
 sanjay singh ne isse pehle aaj hi congress se istipha de diya
 Apart from Congress and SP members, senior NCP leaders Sharad Pawar and Praful Patel were also absent in the House
 iske alaava trinmul congress, dramuk, iuemail or kerala congress ke ek- ek sadsy bhi voting ke dauraan gaiyr hajir rahe
 KT Tulsi, who is a nominated member, was also absent during the voting but he continued to oppose the bill
 vipakshi dal ke sadasyon kii gaiyr hajiri ke alaava annadramuk, basapa or tiares ke sadsy bhi sadan main nahin the jisase sarkaar ne upree sadan main is vidheyak ko paarit kara liya
 Significantly, the ruling party does not have a majority in the upper house
 teen talaak bill par pidipi saansadon ne bhi voting main hissaa nahin liya
 In fact, two PDP mps did not participate in voting after the bill was introduced in the Upper House
 is vajah se bahumat kaa aankada or kam ho gaya
 And the Modi government was successful in passing this bill
 bataa den ki pidipi party kii adhyaksh mahabuuba mufti ne sadan main bill pesh hone se pehle kaha tha ki vah is bill ko lekar kisi bhi tarah se sarkaar kaa saath nahin dengi
 But the Modi government indirectly benefited from two party mps not participating in voting
 bataa den ki teen talaak bill ko lekar kuch din pehle hi mahabuuba mufti ne kaha tha ki modi sarkaar is bill ke sahare hamaare (muslim) ke gharon main ghusane kii koshish kar rahi he
 He also tweeted a tweet about the triple talaq bill
 unhone likhaa ki main yah nahin samaj paa rahi hum ki aakhir modi sarkaar is bill ko paas hi kyon karwaane par adi he, khaas kar tab jab supreme court ne ise gaiyr-kanoonee bataaya he
 This is being done only to punish the Muslims
 aisi sthiti main jab deshki arthvyavastha kii haalat inti kharaab chal rahi ho to kya sarkaar ke liye yah itnaa ahm mudda hona chahie?gauratlab he ki vipaksh ke kade aitraaj or bill ko select cameti main bhejne kii maang ke bich teen talaak bill (triple Talaq Bill) rajyasabha se paas ho gaya
 Earlier, the opposition's demand to send the bill to the Select Committee also fell in the House
 voting ke dauranbill ko select cameti main bhejne ke paksh main 84, jabaki virodh main 100 vot pade
 Now this bill will be sent to the President for approval
 rajyasabha se teen talaak bill paas hona modi sarkaar kii badi jeet maani ja rahi he
