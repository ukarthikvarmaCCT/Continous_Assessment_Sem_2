 Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday lashed out at the Central Government once again in the Lok Sabha
 unhone kaha, 'sabase bade chor khule main aate hai or suut pahanakar aate hai
 'significantly, Rahul has been using the word' boot-boot government 'for the central government

 The immediate or direct cause of our first freedom struggle in 1857 was the rebellion of Indian soldiers in the British Army, who were agitated upon discovering that the paper which was mounted on the cartridges of the new Enfield rifles would contain cow and pig fat
 Was so that the cartridge would not get wet
 sainikon ko in kaartuson kaa istemaal karne se pehle is kaagaj ko daant se kaatna padataa tha
 In this way, the British had hurt the religious sentiments of both Muslims and Hindus, due to which both of them organized and revolted
 bharat kaa pehla swatantraaa sangram may 1857 main shuru hua tha
 This struggle is considered to be the largest and most bloody anti-colonial uprising in any European empire in the 19th century
 hamaare 200 varshon ke swatantraaa andolan main hamaare netaaon ne bahut se saamaajik muddon ko bhi uthaaya
 One such issue was the inter-state banquet
 kya ucch jati ke logon ko nimna jati ke logon ke saath ek hi paant main baithkar bhojan karnaa chahie
 Those who wanted to challenge the customs of the upper caste Hindus felt that they should move forward in this direction
 yahaan tak ki gandhi ji ne yah "sweekaar karte hue shuruyaat kii thi ki chuaachhut galat he lekin saath hi unhone yah bhi kaha ki antarjaateey bhoj or antarjaateey vivaah bhi galat he
 After this he proceeded in this direction and accepted the inter-caste gathering and inter-caste feast
 unhone tark diya tha ki sabhi varna samaan hai
 The last and the biggest step was taken in 1946 in which the caste system was directly challenged by accepting inter-caste marriages
 ''bharat ke rashtravaadi netaaon main antarjaateey-bhoj ke mudde par jamkar bahes hui or unhone ek-duusare par khub hamale kiye

 Storm in the saucer Now, 70 years after independence, what does freedom mean for us Indians? During the freedom movement, poets used to imagine that independent India would be like a garden where flowers of different colors would bloom, birds would sing on trees, squatting streams would make uproads
 lekin aaazaad bharat main ek kavi ne likhaa he ki sari prakruti sampradayik aadhaar par baant di gai he
 Syed Ahmed Javed Jaffrey read a poem by someone in a ceremony held in Bangalore, some of whose lines have gone viral on social media, which are as follows: See the effect of hatreds, the division of animals has turned Hindu and the goat has become a Muslim
 Trees, these leaves, these branches will also be disturbed, if the birds too become Hindus and Muslims, the dry fruits too are disturbed seeing this, do not know when coconut Hindus and Khajur Muslims In the way religions are also being distributed to the colors, that green is the color of Muslim and red is the color of Hindus, so the day is not far when all the vegetables will become Muslims and only parts of Hindus will come only carrots and tomatoes
 It has been said to whom the watermelon will go, the poor will remain Muslim from above and Hindu from inside
 dukhad he ki keval sampradayik simaaen hi hamen ek-duusare ke saath mil-baithkar khaane-pine se nahin rokatii hai, balki hamen yah bhi bataaya ja rahaa he ki hamaari rashtriyata is baat se tay hogi ki ham kya khate hai
 Those who are vegetarian are more Indian and those who eat beef violate Indian ethos

 But is this the real reason behind the killing of Dalits or Muslims and progressive intellectuals at the hands of the cow vigilantes? If Hindutva contractors actually consider cow to be venerable, why did they starve 500 cows in a Rajasthan government gaushala in 2016? Diya, while this is the only state where for the first time a separate ministry has been created to protect the cows? Or why one emanated from the RSS Manohar Parrikar, the chief minister of a Hindu majority state, stands with beef traders? Or why Hindutva goons beat Swami Agnivesh in Jharkhand? The saffron-clad Hindus, strongly believing in the Rigveda, opposed to beef eating, is anusuchee main adivaasiyon kii jameen ko vishesh suraksha di gai he
 To understand the politics of growing intolerance and hate, we must read the British Famine Commissions' famine arguments
 120 varshon ke angreji shashan ke dauraan 120 bhayanak akaal pade the (jabaki is upmahadweep main angreji shashan se pehle 2000 varshon main keval 17 akaal pade the)
 The famine commissions attributed Indian customs and traditions to the reduction of famine relief work
 unhone aupniveshik nitiyon kii aalochana ko aparaadh tehraaya jisamen khulaasa kiya gaya tha ki in nitiyon ke kaaran abhaav paidaa hua
 As a nation, why don't we talk about the crisis in agriculture, which has led to 59,000 farmers committing suicide in independent India, 23,000 between 2009 and 2016! It is true that the national media occasionally argues for a particular death due to hunger but does not state that 7,000 people die of hunger every day in independent India
 lekin hamaara media or madhya varg shopping mal ke food court main khaane kaa majaa lene main hi vyast rahata he
 The noise of the food stalls is repressed by the shopkeepers on the street, who are trying to evict the multinational corporations like Walmart shops

 Amidst this dismal scenario, i still dream of living in a country where everyone dines together, enjoys variety of cuisines, jokes on each other's food habits, but also of equality and respect Sit with the spirit and no one is hungry

 Prior to the 2009 general election, Paswan made the mistake of aligning with Lalu and leaving the Congress as a coalition partner
 tab ve na keval loksabhaa chunaav haar gaye the balki naaraaz congress ne unhen rajyasabha main pravesh karne ke baad bhi mantri pad dene se inkaar kar diya tha
 But it was also a matter of benefit for them as it opened the way for the Modi-led BJP to be mistaken for a day before the 2014 Lok Sabha elections

 The young Paswan was elected to the post of Deputy Superintendent of Police, but did not do the job, which was considered very safe then

 He contested and won the Bihar assembly elections in 1969

 Since then he has shown flexibility in making friends

 Even his bitter critics have little to say against him

 In these years he went from Lok Dal to Janata Dal and then formed his own party

 The era of coalition politics flourished and Paswan took the most advantage of it

 He left the Vajpayee government after the 2002 Gujarat riots
 phir jis narendra modi kii khulkar aalochana kar chuke the, 2014 main unheen modi ke saath aa mili
 His assessment of leaving the Vajpayee government with the Congress also proved to be accurate
 sarkaar chhodie ke faisle ne unhen congress kaa ek swaabhaavik mitra bana diya jo 2004 main endie ko haraane ke baad satta main ai thi

 How many medals were held
 ham baat kar rahe hai bharat ke pehle profeshnal boxr dharmendra singh yadav kii
 The country's first professional boxer who struggles for livelihood, an Olympian in the country and a player who has won great moments of glory by winning many big competitions, yearning for a unique job, making big claims for the good of the game and the players in that country
 Questions both the intentions and destinies of governments
 khelon ke liye har saal arabon kaa bajet banataa he, lekin isse khel yaa khilaadi kaa kitna bhala hota he, ye agar jaananaa ho to bharat ke pehle profeshnal boxr dharmendra singh yadav se bada koi udhaaharan nahin ho saktaa
 Dharmendra, who reached the semi-finals of the 1990 World Championships, was obsessed with boxing and his tactical finesse against opponents, making Dharmendra India's greatest boxer of the round
 kadi mehnat or khel ko lekar samarpan ne jeevat bhare is mukkebaaz kii jaldi hi safalataa ke sheersh par bhi pahunchaa diya
 When Dharmendra's punch hit the opponents, he started looking for ways to escape
 unka damdaar panch kaa hi asar tha ki ve 1990 main vishwa yuva boxing championships main semifinal tak pahunchane vaale bharat ke pehle mukkebaaz bane
 Reaching fourth in the Brits rankings and number seven in the pan-asian ranking, once this process of success started, it continued to progress with each passing day
 unhone saf games, asian championships, kaamanwealth games jaise na jane kitne toornament main bharat ke liye padak jite or podium par desh ko gauravanvit hone kaa mauka diya
 Also represented India in Olympics
 vakt ke saath dharmendra singh yadav ne profeshnal boxing kii taraf kadam badhaayaa
 There was such a success here that he won six of his six matches
 tabhi to brits ranking main chauthe or pan asian rekking main saatven number tak pahunche
 Recognizing his great achievement in boxing, Dharmendra Singh Yadav was also honored with the Arjuna Award
 lekin kehete hai na puraskaron se shaan to badhata he, lekin pet nahin bharta
 The same happened with Dharmendra
 unhen tamaam puraskaar or sammaan to mili, lekin khud ke or parivaar ke bharan-poshan ke liye ek adad naukari ke liye sangharsh karte dikhaai de rahe hai
 Arjun Awardee Dharmendra, who is seeking for a job, faces the difficult challenge of running a family with a wife and two children
 berogari ke is daur main wo un tamaam khel sansthaanon or adhikariyon ke chakkar lagaakar thak chuke hai, jinhone kabhi unki padak jeetne kii kamyaabi ko shaan se apane saath joda tha
 But today when Dharmendra reaches his door with a request for a regular job, his reference is ignored by citing rules
 aisi berukhi dikhaai jaati he, jaise dharmendra singh yadav desh kii mukkebaaji kaa gaurav purush nahin koi sadak chhap insaan hoder lagata he kahin criminal na ban jaaunpariwaar chalaane kii majaburi or ek adad niyamit naukari kii jaddojahad ne dharmendra ko is kadar todakar rakh diya he ki wo kabhi-kabhi roti kii majaburi main aparaadh kii taraf kadam badhaane ke liye sochane ko bhi majaboor ho jate hai
 Dharmendra says that he often fears that his helplessness does not break him completely and turn him towards crime
 koun sunegaa dharmendra kii fariyadaswaal ye he ki aakhir koun sunegaa is bebas khilaadi kii fariyaad
 Will the eye of the present government, which claims development for all, will go towards such a player's helplessness? Will the Sports Ministry's eye go to Dharmendra and other helpless players like him? If a big boxer like Dharmendra Singh Yadav will not get a single job, then how can the future generations dare to step into the games
 phir bhala kaise puraa hoga bharat ko khelon kii mahashakti banane kaa sapana
 How will our bag be filled with Olympic medals
 khel or khilaadiyon ke vikaas ke liye jaruri he desh main aisa maahaul banane kii jab khiladi ritairement ke baad apni roti ke intjaam ke bare main na soche, balki sirf apane khel or padak jeetne par dhyaan lagaae
 He is confident that if today he is doing blood and sweat for the country to win a medal, then after retiring tomorrow, the country will think about him
 usko roti ke liye sangharsh nahin karnaa padegaa
 Only then the number of medals will not only increase, but the sports culture will also develop in the country
 vikaas krishna yadav ko di kochingdharmendra jaise khilaadi desh kii shaan hai
 They need to be saved and not left to struggle for bread
 ritairement ke baad bhi ve desh ke liye bade kaam ke sabit ho sakate hai
 If not sure, ask boxer Vikas Krishna, who had asked Dharmendra Singh Yadav for a few days coaching from the Sports Ministry before the Rio Olympics
 dharmendra ne vikaas ko us chote se hi daur main itnaa guru gyaan de diya ki vikaas rio olympic ke quarter final tak pahunche
 It is obvious that if the Sports Authority of India utilizes experienced players like Dharmendra Singh Yadav as a coach by giving him a permanent job, then the direction and condition of Indian boxing can change in the coming days
 to kya jaldi hi bhartiya khel praadhikaran or khel mantralay kaa dhyaan dharmendra kii taraf jayega or unhen ek sthai naukari dekar unke anubhav kaa istemaal bhartiya mukkebaaji kii bhalaai ke liye kiya jayega? The way Ranbir Kapoor played his character in Sanjay Dutt's biopic is getting much praise
 unka transformation bhi hoobahoo ranbir jaisaa hi he
 But the interesting thing is that for Sanju's role no other actor but Ranbir was the first choice
 is actor kaa naam he ranvir singh
 Producer Vidhu Vinod Chopra told the Telegraph, "when Rajkumar Hirani asked me about Sanjay Dutt's biopic, i asked him - what is it that Sanjay Dutt's life should make in a movie? It's better to make it on my life
 maine javaani main kashmir choda or mumbai aakar sangharsh kiya
 You and Abhijat Joshi have lost their minds "when Rishi Kapoor said to Sanjay Dutt- Stop spoiling my son, Chopra goes on to say," After this Hirani told me about everything that has happened in Sanju's life
 Stunned to hear that
 pehle maine sochaa ki ye betuka tha, sanju raju ko sach nahin bataa rahaa he
 But then we researched his 308 girlfriends and the streets of America begging to buy a bus ticket to know the truth
 iske baad hamen mahasoos hua ki jo kuch unhone bataaya vah sach he
 "sanju's 'madhuri' said- 'naughty child is Ranbir Kapoor' After this, Vidhu Vinod Chopra felt that Sanju's role could play Ranveer Singh better than Ranbir
 baad main hiraani ne unhen ranbir ke naam par sahamat kar liya
 He felt that Ranbir could put Sanjay's emotions on the screen
 bataa den
 'sanju' is directed by Rajkumar Hirani

 i am not his sister's daughter

 shaayad unhen hatya ke bare main bhi kuch pataa ho
 The evidence given by Mikhail to the police
 usamen bhi kahin na kahin peter kaa zikr he
 Surprised even working with Peter, it is astonishing that Peter Mukherjee could not know the reality of Indrani and Sheena in 13 years
 jabaki unke saath kaam karne waalon kaa kahana he ki peter bahut smart or budhimaan vyakti hai
 That's when he is a successful business man
 aise main tajjub hona laazmi he ki unhen is maamle main kuch pataa nahin chal paaya

 Due to this stay of the court, the status quo at the disputed site will remain nyaayamurti aftab alam or nyaayamurti aar em lodha kii peeth ne faisle ke liye aalochana-bhare shabdon main kaha, "yah bahut hairaan karne vaala or ajeeb faisla he
 No one had demanded the partition of the land
 elahabaad hoicourt ne vah raahat di, jisaki maang kisi ne bhi nahin kii thi
 We must correct this mistake now
 " supreme court ne yah bhi nirdesh diya he ki vivaadit bhoomi se sate sarkaar dwaara adhigrahit kiye gaye 67-acre ke zamin ke tukade par bhi koi dharmik gatividhi sanchalit nahin kii jaae
 The bench said that how can such a system be given when neither party had requested the partition of the land
 unhone hoicourt ke faisle par roak lagaate hue kaha, "adaalat ne jo kiya, vah apni ore se kiya
 This is strange
 is tarah ke aadesh par amal kii anumati nahin di ja sakati
 "it is noteworthy that the hearing started in the Supreme Court on Monday only on the appeal made against the judgment of Allahabad High Court in the Babri Masjid ownership case 
 elahabaad hoicourt kii lakhanu bench ne pichley saal 30 sitambar ko jo faisla sunaaya tha, uske khilaaf ol india muslim pasarnal lau board, sunni vakf board, nirmohi akhaada or hindu mahasabha ne apil daayar kii he
 The High Court, in a 2–1 majority decision, divided the disputed land into three parts, giving one part to the Sunni Waqf Board, one part to the Nirmohi Arena, and the third to ‘ramlala’

 uttar pradesh desh kii raajnneeti main bada mahatv rakhata he
 This is the reason that the entire country keeps an eye on every election held here
 shuukravaar ko uttar pradesh kii 10 rajyasabha siton ke liye chunaav hua
 During this period, the situation remained critical throughout the day and the BJP won after the late night drama
 10 siton main se 9 par bhaajapa ke pratyaashiyon ne jeet darj kii
 This Rajya Sabha election in UP caused upheaval in exactly the same way as in the Rajya Sabha elections of Gujarat
 tab bhi der raat tak hivoltage drama hua tha, bijepi ne congress ke ahamed patel ko haraane ke liye puraa jor lagaaya tha, lekin tab bijepi haari thi or shuukravaar ko usne jeet kaa swaad chakhaa he
 What happened in Uttar Pradesh 
 
 darasal, uttar pradesh kii 10 siton main se 8 siton par bijepi kii jeet pakki thi, jabaki ek seat samaajawaadee party ke khate main janaa bhi tay tha
 But the real fight was for the 10th seat, on which Anil Aggarwal from BJP and Bhimrao Ambedkar from BSP
 voting ke dauraan kai vidhayakon ke cross voting kii baat saamne ai to iskaa phayda bijepi ko mila
 bsp's Anil Singh, sp's Nitin Aggarwal openly supported the BJP
 roki gai thi countincounting shuru hone ke dauraan upi rajyasabha chunaav main ballat paper par aapatti uthi
 Because of this, the counting was stopped by the Election Commission
 aarope tha ki nitin agarwal or anil singh ne apane vot othrise agent ko nahin dikhaae the
 The BSP complained to the Election Commission and for this reason the counting has been stopped
 bispi or sapa ne donon vidhayakon ke vot ko radd karne kii maang kii thi
 Counting began only after the order of the Election Commission
 basapa-bijepi main aar-parantija saamne aane ke baad basapa ne bhartiya janata party par dhanabal ke istemaal kaa aarope lagaaya to vahiin bijepi kii ore se bhi karaara waar kiya gaya
 After the results, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said that due to bjp's spectacular victory in this election, the Samajwadi Party's opportunistic face once again saw the people of the state
 yah pehali baar nahin he, jab soobe kii janata ke saamne samaajawaadee party kaa avasarwaadi cheharaa saamne aayaa he
 He lashed out at the SP and said that the SP only knows to take, but does not know to give
 gujarat main aisi hi thi tasviir, lekin haari thi bijepipichley saal gujarat main rajyasabha chunaav main bhi kuch aisi hi tasviir bani thi
 There was a one-vote battle in that too
 us chunaav ko bhi bijepi ne pratishtha kaa prashn bana liya tha
 But at the time, Ahmed Patel proved to be a juggler
 gujarat ke rajyasabha chunaav main kul 176 vot kiye gaye the
 Of these, 2 votes were canceled, due to which 174 votes were counted
 ek samay haarate dikh rahe ahamed patel ain vakt par jeet darj karne main kaamyaab ho gaye
 He defeated BJP candidate Balwant Rajput
 us chunaav main puure din hivoltage drama chalaa tha
 Amit Shah himself was camping in Gujarat
 ladaai is kadar thi ki gujarat se lekar dilli main chunaav ayog tak sargarmi thi
 The Congress reached the Election Commission's door late in the night due to the cancellation of votes of two mlas
 congress ke is prayaas ko kamjor karne ke liye bijepi ne 6 kendriya mantriyon kaa dailygation chunaav ayog bheja tha
 Under the leadership of Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, Ravi Shankar Prasad, Piyush Goyal, Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, Nirmala Sitharaman and Dharmendra Pradhan reached the Election Commission office and sought to bypass the Congress appeal
 or aisa kareeb ek yaa do baar nahin balki puure teen baar hua tha
 Almost late 1 night after hard work
 30 baje chunaav ayog ne dobaaraa ginati shuru karne kaa aadesh diya tha
 - Chidambaram said that this is the biggest achievement of Manmohan Singh's government that he had taken 14 crore people out of the poverty line, but the BJP government has again pushed people into poverty
 garibi rekha se neeche rahane vaale logon kii sankhya badi he or yah bijepi sarkaar kii sabase badi naakamayaabi he jo unhone bharat ke logon ke naam kii he
 It's the biggest achievement of Dr Manmohan Singh that 14 Cr people were listed out of poverty

 They make mistakes
 lekin agar galati hi unka iklauta jurm hoti to koi story yaa kahani nahin banati
 The real crimes of yellow journalism are prejudice, gossip and bribery
 maalikon or sampadakon ke visheshadhikaar, purvaagrah or doum darje ke newsroom kii khuraaq, gap ke bich ek varg kaa antar he
 But there is no class of cash
 purvaagrah ke mukaable gap main zyada eemaandaaree hoti he; usamen zyada kutark ho saktaa he par chal-kapat yaa beyimaani kam hoti he; gap shaayad hi kabhi aisa banane kaa swang karti he jo vah nahin he; uski style bedam, kamjor hoti he, suzav or andeh par buree tarah nirbhar hoti he
 Low-level press owners serve bias under the guise of pseudo-ideology
 purvaagrah ek samskruti he, aisa anuvaanshik lakshan he jo kisi prakaashan ke diene main rachaa-basaa hota he
 Every level of factory knows its algebra: gossip leads to sensation, sensation leads to sales, sales increases advertising, advertising increases salaries
 yah sansani kaa pakkaa ganit he
 The most familiar element of sensation, sex, is a relatively pure luxury: mere vulgarity can never equate a popular subject like fear in terms of affecting and arousing the reader's feeling
 dar ke kaaran shatruta yaa nafrat paidaa hoti he
 The real predator of the media business, like Rupert Murdoch, Genius derives its power from three generators
 pehla he, ek nirmam vijeta kii ufanti mahatvakanksha
 It really needs to be genius or extremely skillful; You cannot be Genghis Khan or Timur without the will, the source of merit and the extraordinary resources of the imagination of a gambler whose zeal increases in proportion to his stakes
 aapke paas gulam banane ke liye samrajyon kii kami nahin ho sakati
 Success is the only law
 bazaar main iklauti niti haih jo bikta he vah acha hi hoga, kyonki uskaa kharidaar he
 Failure is evil
 pathakon ko vahi miltaa he jiske ve laayak hai or jiske laayak hai unhen miltaa he
 There is no sentimentalism about the material: Those who want a funeral or a prasad get a Wall Street Journal; Those who enjoy Darshan Rati get the News of the World
 darshan ratihdhemi spasht rup se kisi aapattijanak kaam yaa aparaadh kaa saajheedaar hota haih foohadataa main saajha anand hota he
 There is no Murdoch without a reader, and in fact there is no reader without a Murdoch
 ve aise saajheedaar hai jinhen ek-duusare kii jarurat he
 Journalists — whether it is an editor like Andy Colson having dinner with the prime ministers, or following celebrities — are the essential link, driven by a hefty cash reward for obscenity
 aajeevika ke liye toplace modelon kii tasviir khinchne vaale photographer darasal kaaphi murajhaae hote hai
 Readers look at those pictures with a skew
 kahaniyaan aise tede swabhaav vaale vyakti gadhate hai jinaki achche swaad kii shuruaati bhukh mar chuki hoti he
 The first page is driven by mania, which feeds on the hunger of competition
 chunki is duniya main keval paise kii hi ahmiyat hoti he, koi yah nahin sochataa ki kya kisi maari gai ladki, mili doular-2002 main hatya ke samay uski umr mahaj 13 saal thi-ke mobile phone ko hack karnaa galat harakat he
 The third aspect of the Murdoch power triangle is power
 murdoch ke tableydon ke pathakon kii sankhya kisi bhi rajnatik party ke sadasyon kii sankhya se kai guna zyada he
 Just think: Who sets the agenda for elections? Murdoch traded reader numbers for strength
 raajnneetikon ne maan liya, yaa phir
 The British political accountability pen understood the dangers of ghouls
 print media ke shuruaati dinon main britain kii sansad main hnnes ke pravesh par pratibandh laga diya gaya tha
 Printing a report of an argument was considered a "great insult" and a "gross violation of privilege"
 aadhunik raajnneetikon ko murdoch ke saath ghunt lagaana aasaan laga
 This relationship develops with great care, as does a ruling class with a good breed of generations to qualify
 britain ke pradhanmantri david camerun ke nijee doston ke halake, jise ab north oxford set qaraar diya gaya he, main shaamil thim ribeka brooks jo giraftaar kiye jane se pehle tak murdoch kii ek company kii chif akjicutive thi; ruport kii beti elizabeth murdoch or unke pati mathew frid jo chikani-chupadi baaten karne vaale piaar ke vyakti hai; or ruport ke bete james murdoch
 His closest mentor was Andy Colson, who led the team as editor when Millie Dowler's phone was called 'ping' (a technical term used by police to monitor a mobile phone)
 is set ne desh ke vibhinn ilaakon main cat glass main behtareen wine gatki, or shandaar baatcheet ne camerun ke lakhon pound kii rasoi main taiyaar raatri ke khaane kaa swaad nihsandeh badha diya
 How could we have ever guessed that there is a multifaceted financial-political profit in the center of this reconciliation? When someone's moral direction disappears, heaven disappears
 murdoch ko maaloom tha ki unhen pradhanmantriyon yaa unki police se kabhi koi khatra nahin he, jinhone kareeb ek dashak tak saboot se beja munh phere rakhaa
 But he made the dangerous mistake of believing that his readers are as immoral as they are
 pathakon ne surasurahat mahasoos kar lee; lekin unhone ek bacchee kii laash ko bhunaane ke maamle main bardaasht kii had tay kar di
 This algebra backfired: Murdoch without the reader is a useless Murdoch
 raajnneetikon ke paas bekaar kaa koi istemaal nahin hota
 There is no one more lonely than a weak deity who falls face down
 is puure virodh ke dauraan chaatro ke samarthan main kai hastiyaan aage ain jisamen nirdeshak dibaakar banerjee, anand patavardhan sahit aath kalakaaron ne andolankaaree chaatro ke saath ekajutata dikhaate hue or desh main badhati ashishnutaa ke virodh main apane rashtriya puraskaar lautaa die
 After the death of a Dalit man in a police custody in Amethi, Uttar Pradesh, the Congress delegation on Friday asked the Yogi Adityanath government to pay compensation to the victim's family and send the accused policemen to jail
 isse pehle mangalvaar raat congress mahasachiv priyanka gandhi ne mritak ram avatar ke parivarajanon se mulaakaat kii thi
 The delegation of Congress, who arrived in Bhikharipur village of Amethi on Friday, met the victim's family

 america tech diggaj aipal ne airpower ko khatm karne kaa elaan kiya he
 airpower was introduced by the company in 2017 with the iphone X
 haalanki tab sirf iskaa elaan kiya gaya or iske fitures ke bare main bataaya gaya
 Slowly, people kept waiting and different reports came
 aakhirkaar ab aipal ne yah saaf kar diya he kii wireles charging mat airpower project ko khatm kiya ja rahaa he
 The reason for this is stated by the company that it was having difficulty in giving high standard to Apple
 hairaani kii baat ye he ki haal hi main aipal ne wireles yearphones – airpod 2 launch kiya he
 The bottom of its box is made of airpower and it is shown that it can also be charged with airpower mats
 aise main achaanak ye faisla thodaa ajeeb jarur he
 When airpower was announced with the iphone X, the company said that it can be charged by keeping the iphone, Air Pods and Smart Watch with wireless charging support
 ye bhi kaha gaya ki ek saath teenon ko is charging mat par rakh kar charji kiya ja sakegaa
 After this, no information was received from the company about this charging mat
 aipal ne ek statemen main kaha he, ‘kaaphi efort lagane ke baad hamane ye paaya he ki airpower hamaare hai standard ko match nahin kar paaya or hamane is project ko cancil kar diya gaya he
 We apologize to the customers who were waiting for this launch
 ham is baat par yakeen jari rakhenge ki future wireles he or ham iske experience ko aage badhaate rahenge’aipal ne saaf taur par kuch bhi nahin kaha he ki project cancil kyon kiya gaya he
 But experts and engineers believe that the main reason for canceling airpower is that many 3D coils would have been the problem of overheating being in one place and without a power management system

 The Delhi High Court has sent notices to the three mcds and the Delhi government over the horrific fire that took place last Tuesday (february 12) at Hotel Arpit Palace in Karol Bagh, Delhi
 hai court ne is maamle kii sunwaayee ke dauraan kaha ki sarkaar or civik agenciyaan bataaen ki aakhir is tarah ke haadase hone kii kya vajah he or ab tak bina enosi ke dilli main aise kitne hotel chal rahe hai
 Apart from this, the court has also sought answers from the agency and the Delhi government regarding compensation
 hai court main mangalvaar ko arpit bhargav kii taraf se ek arji lagaai gai thi jisamen kaha gaya tha ki dilli main bina fire license ke is tarah ke hotel dhadlle se chal rahe hai or uske chalate yahaan thaharne vaale logon kii jindagi daanv par rahati he
 Apart from this, Bhargava also said that the Delhi government should set guidelines for such hotels, procession houses and community centers in a time frame and if those guidelines are not followed then not only against such hotels but those officials Strict action should be taken against those who are responsible for monitoring hotels
 pichley hafte arpit hotel main aag lagane ke chalate 17 logon ne apni jaan ganvaa di thi
 The hotel was running a restaurant without taking NOC and this hotel was being run without following many rules
 hotel arpit pales ke maalik or unke bhai rakesh goyal ko shanivaar ko dilli airport se us vakt giraftaar kiya gaya tha, jab vah katar se waapas lautaa tha
 Like the dedicated hotels, there are hundreds of hotels in Delhi, where the rules are being followed and in the same way, like the dedicated hotels, an accident can happen at any time and people can lose their lives
 , But sometimes due to the lax attitude of the government and agencies, such hotels are not closed unless there is a big accident
 dilli hai court dilli ke baraat ghar or community centres main niyamon ke ulanghan se judi ek janhit yachika par sunwaayee kar rahi thi, lekin mangalvaar ko court ne is yachika main privet hotalon ko bhi shaamil kar liya he
 On March 13, the Delhi High Court will hear again in this case
 lekin usase pehle dilli sarkaar or civik agenciyon ko halafanama dekar hai court ko yah bataanaa hoga ki durghatnaon ko rokane ke liye unki planning kis tarah kii he

 Now 6 months have passed since GST came into force
 paanchaven or chathe maheene main kendra sarkaar kii kamai ko tagada jhatka laga he
 According to the data, the main reason for this is the fall in tax collected under GST
 yani centre sarkaar ko jiesti lagu hone ke baad tex se aamadani kii jitani ummid thi vah usapar khari nahin utari he
 Has GST weakened the government's earnings? After the implementation of GST, there have been serious questions about the decrease in central government's earnings in October and November

 These are the major questions: 1
 kya jiesti kaa maujuuda swaroop kendra sarkaar kii aamadani main ijapha karne ke liye paryaapt nahin he?2
 Was the claim of increase in tax made on the basis of this pattern before the implementation of GST? 3
 yaa phir jiesti lagu hone ke baad iske swaroop main kiye gaye baari badlaavon ne hi kendra sarkaar kii us aas par pani pher diya jisase vah apni kamai main ijapha darj karne ja rahi thi?4

 The failure of the central government to collect tax and generate revenue during the current financial year is being considered to bridge its fiscal deficit through debt
 gauratlab he ki kendra sarkaar ne maujuuda vitt varsh main diarect tex main 20 hajaar karod or indiarect tex ke jariye kamai main 25-35 hajaar karod rupee kii kami kaa anumaan lagaaya he
 GST collection declined for the second consecutive month and in November it decreased to just Rs 80,808 crore

 According to the Finance Ministry statement, the total GST collection stood at Rs 80,808 crore as of December 25

 At the same time, the most important aspect in this reform was to increase the income from the central government's tax by making an important exercise to prevent tax evasion in business

 At the same time, due to the correct assessment of tax, the major increase in the central government's earnings was also expected that the biggest benefit of this tax reform would be directly and indirectly to the consumer

 supreme court ne ek ahm faisle main kaha he ki mrityudand paae aparaadhiyon kii dayaa yachika par anischitkaal kii deree nahin kii ja sakati or deree kiye jane kii sthiti main unki sajaa ko kam kiya ja saktaa he
 Simultaneously, the apex court ordered the death sentence of 15 convicts to be commuted to life imprisonment
 inamen se chaar doshi virappan ke sahyogi hai, jinhen 22 pulisavaalon kii land mine blast kar hatya karne ke aarope main faansee kii sajaa sunai gai thi
 Apart from these four, this decision can also have an impact on the mercy petitions of Murugan, Aruvi and Santhan, who were hanged on charges of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, which has been pending for a long time
 court ne yah bhi kaha ki mrityudand kaa saamana karne vaala kaidi yadi maansik rup se aswasth he, to use faansee nahin di ja sakati or uski sajaa kam karke aaajeevan karawas main badali jaani chahie
 According to the Supreme Court, it is unconstitutional to keep criminals and other prisoners facing death penalty in solitary confinement
 supreme court ne kaha ki aise maamlo main doshi ke maansik rog ke aadhaar par unki sajaa-e-maut umrakaid kii sajaa main badal di jaani chahie
 Today's verdict may have implications in many cases, including a mercy petition filed by three convicts awaiting the death sentence in the murder of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi
 unhone apni dayaa yachika radd karne ke raashtrapati ke kadam ko chunauti di thi
 While setting the guidelines regarding disposal of mercy petitions and execution of punishment-a-death, a bench headed by Chief Justice p Sathasivam arranged that the prisoners given sentence-to-death must notice their cancellation should be given
 unhen faansee dene se pehle apane parivaar ke sadasyon se mulaakaat kaa ek mauka avashya dena chahie
 The court termed it as unconstitutional to keep any detainees in captivity, including detainees awaiting death sentence, saying that it should not be allowed in prison
 khandpeeth ne yah bhi kaha ki dayaa yachika radd hone ke 14 dinon ke andar sajaa-e-maut par amal kar liya janaa chahie
 Kamada Ekadashi, also known as Falda Ekadashi, is said to be the best fast of Shri Vishnu

 This Ekadashi is said to be the one to relieve the sufferings and to give fruitful results due to the desired results
 is ekadshi kii katha shri krishna ne pandu putr dharmraj yudhisthir ko sunai thi
 Before this, King Dilip was narrated by Vashistha Muni
 caitra shukla ekadshi kii prachlit kathadharmraj yudhisthir kehane lage ki he bhagwan! main aapako koti-koti namaskara karata hum
 Now please kindly say the greatness of Chaitra Shukla Ekadashi
 shrikrishna kehane lage ki he dharmraj! yahi prashn ek samay raja dilip ne guru vashishthaji se kiya tha or jo samaadhaan unhone kiya wo sab main tumse kahata hum
 In ancient times there was a city called Bhogipur
 vahaan par anek aishwaryon se yukt pundaree naam kaa ek raja rajya karata tha
 Many nymphs, eunuchs and Gandharvas used to live in Bhogipur city
 unamem seek jagah lalita or lalit naamake do stri-purush atyant vaibhavshaalee ghar main nivas karte the
 Both of them had immense affection, even when separated they both got distraught
 ek samay pundaree kii sabha main anya gandharvon sahit lalit bhi gaan kar rahaa tha
 While singing, he got the attention of his beloved Lalitha and due to his dissonance, the nature of the song deteriorated
 lalit ke man ke bhav jaanakar carcot naamak naag ne pad bhang hone kaa kaaran raja se kah diya
 Then Pundarik said angrily that you are remembering your woman singing in front of me
 at: tu kaccha maance or manushyon ko khaane vaala rakshas banakar apane kiye karm kaa fal bhoga
 Lalit became a giant monster at the very moment Lalit was cursed by Pundarik
 uskaa mukh atyant bhayankar, netra surya-chandramaa kii tarah pradipt tathaa mukh se agni nikalne lagi
 His nose became as big as a mountain, and his neck began to resemble a mountain
 sir ke bal parvaton par khadey vrikshon ke samaan lagane lage tathaa bhujaaen atyant lambii ho gayi
 In total, his body expanded into eight plan
 is prakaar rakshas hokar vah anek prakaar ke dukh bhogane laga
 When her love, Lalita, came to know about this account, she felt very sorry and started thinking diligently for her husband's salvation
 vah rakshas anek prakaar ke ghor dukh sahataa hua ghaney wanon main rahane laga
 His woman followed him and kept mourning
 ek baar lalita apane pati ke peeche gumti-gumti vindhyaachal parvat par pahunch gai, jahaan par shringi rishi kaa ashram tha
 Lalita soon went to the ashram of Shringi Rishi and went there and started praying with graciousness
 use dekhakar shringi rishi bole ki he subhage! tum koun ho or yahaan kis liye ai ho? lalita boli ki he mune! meraa naam lalita he
 My husband has become a giant monster due to the curse of King Pundarik
 iskaa mujhako mahaan dukh he
 Provide some way for his salvation
 shringi rishi bole he gandharva kanya! ab caitra shukla ekadshi aane vaali he, jiskaa naam kaamada ekadshi he
 By observing this, all human actions are proved
 yadi tu kaamada ekadshi kaa vrath kar uske punya kaa fal apane pati ko de to vah sheeghra hi rakshas yoni se mukt ho jayega or raja kaa shraap bhi avashyamev shant ho jayega
 On hearing such word of Muni, Lalita fasted on coming to Chaitra Shukla Ekadashi and started praying to God in this way, giving her the fruits of her fast in front of the Brahmins to Dwadashi - o Lord! This fast that i have done, my husband will get the fruits of this, so that the demon is freed from the vagina
 ekadshi kaa fal dete hi uskaa pati rakshas yoni se mukt hokar apane puraane swaroop ko praapt hua
 Then, with many beautiful robes and jewelery, he started to Vihar with Lalita
 uske pashchaat ve donon vimaan main baithkar swarglok ko chale gaye
 Vashistha Muni started saying that, o Rajan! By observing this fast, all sins are destroyed and the vagina of demons etc
 is also left
 sansar main iske baraabar koi or doosraa vrath nahin he
 By reading or listening to its story, Vajpayee yajna results

 priyanka kaa sandesh- daadi kaa mood dow
 Sir, it was known that Priyanka Gandhi in his written message, stating the importance of the author, wrote that how is Indiraji's mood today? Those who lived and worked in the house were known through them in the morning
 aakhir subah jab wo indira ke kamare ke baahar pahunchate the, to indira ke kamare ke darban natthu se poochhate the ki bhai aaj mizaaj kaise hai to aksar natthu bolta tha ki sab thik he

 They do not know anything
 dekhie ye aapako loktantric kehete hai or mujhe dictator
 Hearing this story, Sonia turned to the media while clapping and laughing loudly
 unhone jab ye bataaya kiindiraji sonia ko bahooraani bulaati thim, to sonia ke chehre par muskuraahat or khushi saaf dekhi ja sakati thi
 Sonia was red with shame on the story of Karan Singh
 
 
 
 Karan Singh was narrating all his stories with Indira
 unhone kaha ki indiraji ko kashmir bahut pasand tha
 She often went there
 sonia unke kisson ko sunakar hami bhar raheen thim
 Suddenly, Karan Singh said that the story of Sonia's marriage is also remembered
 tab wo pehali baar kashmir ain thi or jo kapade pahane the, usase bilkul kashmiri pandit lag raheen thim
 She wanted to say that 68-year-old Sonia blushed and laughed in a ruddy red sari and said, "oh no, oh no, oh no
" 
 
 par karn singh nahin ruke or kaha ki nahin soniyaji main sahi kah rahaa hum, aap lag raheen thim

 Perhaps it is also a big reason that the Gandhi family showed great interest in its release and Sonia appeared there in a different way

 - international court ke 16 main se 15 jaj bharat ke paksh main rahe, kulbhushan jadhav kii faansee kii sajaa par roak laga di gai he
 - The International Court reminded Pakistan of the Vienna Convention, saying that the Vienna Agreement was violated by Pakistan, which is serious
 - courtne pakistan se poocha ki kyon nahinjadhav ko konsyular diya gaya, kyon nahin bhartiya naagarik ko giraftaar karne ke baad bharat ko isaki jaankaree di gai
 - India had demanded the release of Kulbhushan Jadhav from the court, the court has rejected this demand of India
 - isije ke sheersh nyaayadhish ne kaha ki jadhav ke bhartiya naagarik hone par andeh kii koi gunjaaish nahin
 - The top judge of ICJ dismissed Pakistan's objections to the admissibility of India's application in the Jadhav case, saying- India's application is admissible
 - purv videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj ne international court ke faisle par khushi jaahir kii, apane twitor acount par purv videsh mantri ne likhaa ki kulbhushan jadhav ke masale par international court ke faisle kaa tahe dil se swaagat he
 This is a big win for India
 i wholeheartedly welcome the verdict of International Court of Justice in the case of Kulbhushan Jadhav
 It is a great victory for India
 / 1- is faisle main mahatvapurn baat ye rahi ki jajon ke panel main maujuud, china kii jaj ne bhi bharat ke haq main apana faisla diya
 Let me tell that India challenged the ICJ in the case of Jadhav's death sentence by a military court of Pakistan
 pakistan kii sainya adaalat ne april 2017 main band kamare main sunwaayee ke baad jasusi or aatankwaad ke aaropon main bhartiya nausena ke sevanivrutt adhikari jadhav (49) ko maut kii sajaa sunai thi
 India reacted strongly to his sentence
 pakistan se jadhav ko reeha karne kii apilon ke baar-baar khaarij hone ke baad bharat ne is sambandh main vaanijya duutavas sambandhon par vienna samjhaute kaa khulaa ulanghan kaa aarope lagaate hue aath may 2017 ko hegg sthit antarrashtriya nyaayalay kaa darwaja khatkhataya tha
 Describing Pakistan's charge of calling Jadhav as a spy, India said in a global court that it was not reported until long after Jadhav's arrest and Pakistan did not even reveal his rights to the accused
 bharat ne isije ko baad main bataaya ki pakistan ne vienna samjhaute kaa ulanghan karte hue bharat ke baar-baar aagrah karne ke baavjood jadhav ko rajanyik sampark uplabdh karaane kii anumati nahin di
 The federal appeals court has also slammed the order of Donald Trump, who banned the arrival of citizens and refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries in the US
 isse bhadke trump ne jajon ko hi court main dekh lene kii baat kahi
 On behalf of the Trump administration, a petition was filed in the appeals court and demanded the removal of the ban imposed by the lower court on the travel ban decision
 unki yachika par teen jajon ke ek panel ne sunwaayee kii or teenon ne hi ekamat sadonald trampake aadesh ko asanvaidhanik qaraar diya
 'the Court of Appeals said in its judgment,' We believe that the government has not proved that it has power in its appeal nor has it proved that not removing the ban will result in huge loss
 'jajon ke is faisle se bhadke trump ne twit kar narazgi jataai or unhen court main dekh lene kii baat kahi
 "will see you in court," Trump tweeted
 hamaare desh kii suraksha daanv par he!'see YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE!— Donald J
 Trump (@realdonaldtrump) February 9, 2017 Trump's tweet shows that he is not ready to back down in the case and can now approach the Supreme Court for order restoration
 haalanki america raashtrapati ko supreme court se bhi khushkhabari milane kii ummid kam hi hai
 The reason for this is that in the bench of eight judges of the Supreme Court, four Republicans are of the trend, while four of the trends are towards the Democrats
 aise main agar chaar-chaar se faisla baraabar rahata he, to travel bain kaa aadesh khaarij hi rahegaa
 Amidst the disappointment from the courts, according to legal know-how, Trump should approach Parliament for this
 unhen america congress kii manjuuri se bill laana chahie, jiske baad sanvaidhanki taur par ise chunauti nahin di ja sakegi
 Let us tell you that Trump on January 27 imposed a temporary ban on the entry of citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen into the US
 is faisle kaa duniyabar main virodh ho rahaa he
 In many US cities and airports, people are protesting against Trump's decision
 shuukravaar ko siatal ke ek fedral jaj james robaat ne is bain par pratibandh laga diya tha
 The judge said that a detailed legal review of this decision will be done

 He said that when the construction of the Ram temple starts, the country will start developing rapidly
 unhone saaf taur par kaha ki ram mandir nirmaan ko lekar ab bhi bahut si chunautiyaan hai, jinase nipatane kii jarurat he
 RSS General Secretary Bhaiyyaji Joshi on Ram temple in Ayodhya: Mandir bane ye humari ichha hai
 2025 tak poora hona chahiye, ye humari ichha hai, sarkar ko tay karna hai
 25 ko shuru karne ki baat nahi ki hai, aaj shuru hoga to 5 varsho mein banega

 is twit main kathith rup se HAL kii ore se raksha mantri nirmala sitaraman ke ek bayaan par palatwaar kiya ja rahaa he
 Many users on Twitter are reacting very well considering this to be the real tweet of HAL
 bataa den ki 13 sitambar ko raksha mantrinirmala sitaramanne news agency PTI ko die intervyuu main rafel deal ko lekar bada khulaasa kiya tha
 The Defense Minister had said that the agreement for the purchase of 126 Rafale jets during the UPA government could not be reached due to the collapse of HAL
 Deal for procurement of 126 Rafale jets under UPA fell through as HAL did not have required capability to produce them: Nirmala sitharaman@defenceminindia— Press Trust of India (@pti_news)september 13, 2018raksha mantri ke isi bayaan par @hal_india naam ke twitor handle se ek twit main nishaanaa saadhaa gaya

 Bollywood singer Carolissa Montiero also retweeted this tweet and targeted the Defense Minister
 jane maane utubar dhruv rathi ne bhi is twit ko apane fasebuk time line par share kiya
 So did Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) really disagree with Nirmala Sitharaman's statement? India Today Fact Check team's investigation revealed that the Twitter handle from which this tweet was made is not the real Twitter handle of HAL
 log @hal_india ko HAL kaa asli twitor handle samajhakar is twit ko share karte rahe
 To know the truth of this fake Twitter handle, we first approached the public relations officer of HAL
 unhone hamen bataaya ki HAL kaa aadhikarik twitor handle @HALHQBLR he
 When we went to this Twitter handle, we came to know that @hal_india has also complained to Twitter from this account
 HAL ne twit main likhaa he ki ye hamaare notice main aayaa he @hal_india is aadhikarik handle @HALHQBLR kii nakal kar rahaa he
 By the way @hal_india account has been activated only in September
 is acount ne apane aap ko HAL kaa anofitial acount ghoshit kar rakhaa he
 Looking at the post of the Twitter account, it seems that this account was opened for laughter
 lekin shaayad is acount ke profile pikchar or naam kii vajah se hi log ise HAL kaa aadhikarik twitor acount samaj baithe
 Youtube Dhruv Rathi also shared this fake tweet, which he later deleted
 is bare main puche jane par dhruv ne farzi twit share karne par maafi bhi maang lee
 The investigation by the Fact Check team proved that the tweet handle denying Nirmala Sitharaman's claim had nothing to do with Hindustan Aeronautics Limited

 In terms of artificial intelligence, build quality, design, features, camera and software, these two smartphones are seen to be overshadowing the iphone 7 and iphone 7 Plus
 ham aapako in donon smartphone ke wo pahalu bataaenge jo iphone 7 main nahin hai
 If they are, then they will directly compete with Google's Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones, because this time Google has left no stone unturned to improve them
 camerapahele iphone kaa camera market kaa best camera mana jaataa tha lekin ab aisa nahin he
 First the camera of Galaxy S7 Edge and now Google Pixel has proved that apart from the iphone camera, the cameras are the best in the market

 iske jariye smartphone ke lagbhag sabhi chote bade kaam kar sakate hai
 It will tell you everything, whether to send a message to someone, to schedule a meeting, to order food or to know about traffic
 ye pehle smartfones hai jinamein inbilt google acystant diya gaya he
 day-dream Virtual Reality Both smartphones support Daydream, Google's virtual reality platform
 iske liye company ne khaas virtual reality hedset launch kiya he jisase ise lagaakar utyub, echbio or netflix ke virtual reality videos dekh sakate hai
 Pixel Launcher: This is not like Google's old Nexus smartphone
 ise analock karte hi aapako ek nai home screen dikhegi jise company ne piksl launture kaa naam diya he
 It does not have an app drawer like the Nexus or other Android smartphones
 iske liye upar swip karnaa hoga jahaan se ap dikhenge
 Date, time and weather will be visible by tapping the g logo on the top right of the screen
 google search box bhi nahin he iske liye g ko tap karnaa hoga
 Unlimited backup for HD videos and photos Like the iphone 7 or other smartphones, you will not lack storage

 Smart storagepixel smartphones will be available with two memory variants 32GB and 128GB
 lekin inamen micro esady saport nahin die gaye hai
 If the storage is less then in such a situation, these smartphones will clicker photos and videos by themselves so that the space increases
 ghabaraane kii baat nahin he kyonki jo videos or photose hataae jaaenge wo pehle hi google cloud par store kar liye gaye honge
 The special thing is that their quality will not matter
 google quick switch adeptoraisa lag rah he jaise google ne isaki puri taiyaari kar lee he ki yphone yugers ab Pixel kii taraf aaenge
 Hence the company has introduced the Quick Switch USB type-c adapter
 iske jariye yugers apane puraane smartphone se Pixel main contacts, massej, photose or duusare contents aasaani se transfar kar sakate hai
 Pixel Camera Finally, Google moved away from the traditional camera app and launched an app that can be used for great photography
 Pixel main 12 megapixl camera he jisamen white balance control or expoger kampaseshan jaise fitures hai
 Using Smart Burst mode, the camera makes the best shot using artificial intelligence

 It was a question of bringing the daughter-in-law's farewell to her son by helicopter
 iske liye suraj singh na chaahate hue bhi ghar main shauchalay banavaane kii shart maanane ke liye raji ho gaya
 The toilet, which was made a day before the wedding, was to be held on April 27, so just a day before that, a toilet was painted outside the house

 If you want permission, first build a toilet in the house

 ’ After Lashkar and Al Qaeda, ISS is the new and most dreaded face of terror
 pehle neuyark ke world trade centre phir mumbai par aatanki hamalaa or ab paris
 Whatever may be the name of terror, but every time humanity itself is bled
 aisa hi aatanki hamalaa shuukravaar kii raat paris main hua jisane puri duniya ko hilaakar rakh diya
 This attack became the third major terrorist attack in the world
 pehla bada aatanki hamalaaj se chaudaa saal pehle 11 sitambar 2001 ko puri duniya neaatank kaa wo karnama dekhajise dekhakar insaaniyat khaufjada ho gai
 America's famous city of New York was attacked by terrorists in such a way that everyone was shocked
 vimaan ke sahare duniya kii ek aaleeshaan imaarat yani world trade centre pal main jamidoj kar diya gaya
 Thousands died
 doosraa bada hamalabharat kii aarthik rajdhani mumbai us din ko yaad karke ab bhi sihar uthati he
 The day was 26 November 2008, when terrorists attacked many places
 kai begunaahon kii jaan le lee
 Many were also held hostage
 jisamen videshi paryatak bhi shaamil the
 The whole country was stunned
 24 ghante kii kadi mashkkat ke baad suraksha balon ne jaan par khel kar aatankiyon ko maar giraaya or ek aatanki kasaab ko jinda pakad liya tha
 Who was later hanged
 or ab paris par hamalaashuukravaar kii raat paris bephikr parisvaasi apni dhun main magn the
 Everyone was on the streets of the city enjoying the weekend
 shahar ke ek bade stadium main khud france ke raashtrapati oland footbal match kaa majaa le rahe the
 Then the terrorists attacked this beautiful city
 ek saath kai jagahon par dhamaake kiye gaye
 The bullet was fired and many people were put to death
 puri duniya par hukumat karnaa chahta he iesis hamale kii jimmedaari duniya ke sabase khoonkhaar aatanki sanghathan iesas ne lee he
 The aim of this ghastly terrorist organization is to wave the Islamic State flag around the world, including Iraq and Syria
 isi makasad ko lekar islamic state of iraq and syria kaa gathan hua he
 This organization has made terror its weapon to achieve its objective
 june 2014 main duniya ke saamne aayaa iesayahi wo vakt tha, jab iesas ne duniya ke nakshe par pehali baar apni maujuudagi darj karwaai thi
 Then Abu Bakr al-baghdadi, the self-styled commander of this organization, suddenly tried to draw attention to himself every day by declaring himself the leader of Islamic rule between the cities of Mosul and Tikrit
 lekin iske saath hi bagdadi ne apane jis plan kaa khulaasa kiya, usne puri duniya ko chaunkaa diya
 Slaughtered in the name of Islam, he said that he would soon establish his rule over the entire world along with all the Islamic countries of the world
 magar tab duniya ne iesas ko utani gambhirtha se nahin liya tha
 The reason for this was that even before Baghdadi, there were so many dictators born and ruined in the world
 lekin islamic hukumat ke naam par iesas ne jis tareeke se qatleam kii shuruyaat kii, use dekh kar sabakaa sir chakra gaya
 The group of Sunni militants was gradually spreading their wings in a large area of western Iraq and eastern Syria, separating from al-qaeda's al-qaeda
 lekin bagdadi ke kaman sambhalate hi aatankwaadiyon ke is gut ne apane raste main aane vaale tamaam logon ko gaajar-muuli kii tarah maarane-kaatane kii shuruyaat kar di
 Identified by new methods of murder, this terrorist organization adopted new methods of death
 jinhen dekhakar maut bhi sharma jaae

 And making and releasing their videos became a special hobby of IS

 It is said about Baghdadi that he has been badly injured in American air strikes twice
 lekin hakeekat yahi he ki ab tak uski maut kii khabar saamne nahin ai he
 The world's most wanted is Baghdadi ISIS leader Abu Bakr Al Baghdadi has become the world's most criminal
 iraq main katl-e-aam machaane vaale is aatanki ke sir par 60 karod kaa inaam ghoshit he
 He is called the world's most merciless terrorist

 The statement issued a threat: ISIS released a statement on Saturday

 The statement threatened that if France continued this policy for a long time, it would remain a target of ISIS

 mumbai par hamalaa karne vaale das ke das aatankwaadiyon ko khud unheen ke aakaaon ne dhokhaa diya tha
 Not only cheated but also lied to him
 darasal in dason aatankwaadiyon ko ye kah kar mujahidin banaaya gaya tha ki unka istemaal kashmir kii aazaadee ke liye kiya jayega
 But after a year and a half, when the training was completed, he was suddenly sent to Mumbai
 ye khulaasa kisi or ne nahin khud ajmal kasaab ne kiya he, jiskaa daawa he ki pakistan main har aatankwaadi kashmir ke naam par hi taiyaar kiya jaataa he
 a total of two terrorists entered Nariman House
 or ye donon mumbai ke saath-saath nariman house ke liye bhi bilkul anjaan the
 But his handlers in Pakistan were not unaware of Mumbai or Nariman House
 ajtak ke haath laga he aatankwaadiyon ke pakistani aakaaon se baatcheet kaa wo byora, jo aapke hosh uda degaa
 The terrorists sitting in Pakistan had full knowledge of Nariman House, the people living in it and the surrounding area
 unhen pataa tha ki andar ek israeli parivaar bhi rahata he or aatankwaadi sidhe usee parivaar ke ghar main ghuse the
 Nariman House a building standing in the middle of the residential area of south Mumbai in which most of the people live on rent and these tenants included the family of Moshe, a 5-member Israeli
 26 november kii raat kareeb paune das baje do aatankwaadi eke-47 se goliyaan dandanaate hue isi nariman house main sidhe moshe ke ghar main ghuste hai or bandook kii nok par paanchon ko bandhak bana lete hai
 One of the two terrorists who entered Nariman House had a mobile phone number -9819464530
 andar ghusane ke baad donon aatankwaadi puri raat or phir agle roj subah tak lagaataar ruk-ruk kar baahar kii taraf kabhi grenade phenkate rahe to kabhi goliyaan barasaate rahe
 The security agencies knew that there are terrorists in Nariman House
 magar wo unase aamane-saamne kii ladaai ladane se majaboor the
 Because inside the hostages life was threatened
 lihaaja taj or obaroy kii tarah hi nariman house ke baahar bhi mumbai police ne pojishan to le liya par karrwai ke liye commando kaa intjaar karne lage
 The night passed and it was morning
 paanchon bandhak abhi bhi aatankwaadiyon ke nishane par the
 The NSG commandos from Dalli had reached Nariman House and were preparing to take the front
 tabhi 27 november kii dopaher ko achaanak pehali baar aatankwaadiyon kaa mobile phone baj uthaa
 The call was from Pakistan
 hamale ke baad pakistan main baithe aatank ke aakaaon kaa ye pehla phone tha or phone usee number par kiya gaya tha jiskaa sim bharat se kharida gaya or phir pakistan le jane ke baad waapas bharat laayaa gaya
 In this first conversation, the bosses in Pakistan spoke directly to Moshe's mother
 darasal pakistan main baithe aatankwaadi moshe kii maa ke jariye samjhaute kii baat karnaa chaahate the
 They wanted to get some of their conditions in lieu of the hostages' lives
 isamen khaas baat ye he ki pakistan se aatankwaadiyon ke chaar aakaa baat kar rahe the
 Indian intelligence agencies believe that three of them will be Jarar Shah, Abu Hamza and Abu Kafa
 is baatcheet se itnaa saaf he ki moshe kii maa kam se kam 27 november kii dopaher tak jinda thiah itnaa hi nahin is baatcheet se ye bhi saaf ho jaataa he ki moshe ke parivaar ne apni rihaai ke liye apane logon se baat kii thi or unki baatcheet aatankwaadiyon se bhi karwaai thi
 After talking to Moshe's mother, once again the conversation started with the terrorist Babur on the phone and his bosses in Pakistan and this time the conversation was going on with Kasab
 phone par ye baatcheet 27 november kii dopaher ko ho rahi thi or ajmal kasaab ko 26 november kii raat ko hi kareeb baarah baje girgaanv choupati par giraftaar kar liya gaya tha
 The terrorists sitting in Pakistan knew that Kasab had been caught
 isiilie wo phone par uski rihaai kii baat kar rahe the
 They wanted Kasab to be brought to Nariman House with his companions in lieu of the hostages' lives
 baatcheet ab bhi jari thi
 The only difference was that the terrorist Babur was doing all the talk from Nariman House while his four figures were talking to him in turn one after another over the phone from Pakistan
 pakistan main baithe aatank ke aakaa sirf phone par baat nahin kar rahe the, balki wo lagaataar tivi par is hamale kii pal-pal kii live tasviren bhi dekh rahe the
 Actually some Pakistani news channels were showing live pictures from Indian news channels
 or inhen live tasveeron ko dekh kar pakistan se aatankwaadiyon ke aakaa lagaataar nariman house main apane saathiyon ko suraksha agenciyon kii pojishan bataa rahe the
 He was even telling what the police are doing and where the commandos are holding the front
 donon aatankwaadi nariman house ke andar the or is tarah chupe the ki baahar se unhen koi dekh naa sake
 So who was out there and from which side they were being surrounded, they had no information
 lihaaja ye jaankaree bhi wo pakistan main baithe apane aakaaon se le rahe the
 Actually, at the time when this operation was going on in Mumbai, many TV channels of Pakistan were cutting the Indian news channel live and watching it live on TV, were telling the terrorists sitting in Aqa Nariman House in Pakistan
 is baatcheet se saaf he ki nariman house ke ird-gird kii har choti se choti jaankaree pakistan main baithe aatank ke aakaaon ko thi or wo phone par lagaataar nariman house main baithe aatankwaadiyon kii aankh kaa kaam kar rahe the
 They were telling them what to do, where to fire, where to throw grenades and where to take position
 yani puri stritji mumbai se hajaaron mile dur baith kar live taiyaar kii ja rahi thi or us par amal phone kii madad se kiya ja rahaa tha
 The NSG commandos had reached the spot to rescue Nariman House from the occupation of the country's enemies, but at the same time there was a close watch on the militants of the terrorists sitting in Pakistan on each of their activities
 tabhi to phone par unhen commandos ke khilaaf kaise morcha lenaa he isaki hidaayat di ja rahi thi

 rajasthan main bijepi ne ek baar phir vasundhara raaje sindhiya ke naam par vidhansabha chunaav main utarane kaa faisla kiya he
 Although earlier it was believed that BJP could play the bet on another face in place of Vasundhara Raje, but Amit Shah put the brakes on all the speculations on Sunday
 bataa den ki 2013 se lekar ab tak rajasthan main kul 17 upachunaav hue hai jinamein vasundhara raaje ko ek baar bhi kamyaabi nahin mili
 This is the reason why many BJP leaders had revolted against Vasundhara Raje, which was ignored by Amit Shah and announced the name of Vasundhara
 vasundhara ko rajasthan main chauthi baar siem chehre ke rup main utaarna bijepi ke liye majaburi he yaa jaruri ise in paanch baton se aasaani se samajha ja saktaa he
 1
 vasundhara kii shakti ke aage jhuki bijepivasundhara raaje party alaakaman ko apni shakti pradarshan se waakif karaane main kaamyaab rahi hai
 In fact, there was an increased risk of the party breaking down when it replaced Vasundhara
 rajasthan main bijepi ke 80 fisadi vidhayak vasundhara ke kheme ke hai or unke andhbhakt hai
 All of them are ready to take any step at his behest
 aise main party alaakaman ko unke naam par muhar lagaani padi
 Earlier, PM Narendra Modi and party president Amit Shah wanted to make Union Minister of State for Agriculture Gajendra Singh Shekhawat as state president, but Vasundhara Raje was not ready to agree on this
 party ke kendriya netritv ne raaje ko raji karne ke liye sabhi jatan kiye, lekin ve tus se mas nahin huin
 This was perhaps the first time after Narendra Modi became Prime Minister and Amit Shah the BJP President that the two leaders were not only directly challenged by a regional satraps of the party, but had to kneel down
 gajendra singh kii jagah madan laal saini ko adhyaksh bananaa padaa tha
 2
 vasundhara ke kad kaa doosraa cheharaa nahinrajasthan main vasundhara raaje kaa matlab bijepi or bijepi kaa matlab vasundhara raaje he
 Currently, Vasundhara's stature in the state has no other face in BJP
 haalanki party main om maathur, bhupendra yadav jaise kai diggaj netaa hai, lekin inke paas janaadhar nahin he
 The advantage of this also goes in favor of Vasundhara
 is baat ko isse bhi bakhubi samajha ja saktaa he ki 2008 ke vidhansabha chunaav main sangh ke haath hataa lene ke baad bhi vasundhara raaje apane dam par 78 siten jeetne main kaamyaab rahi thim
 3
 kendriya netritv ko 2019 kii phikrabijepi kaa kendriya netritv ko rajasthan ke vidhansabha chunaav se zyada chintaa agle saal hone vaale 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav kii he
 In such a situation, before 2019, BJP does not want to take any risky steps by making Vasundhara Raje angry
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi rajasthan kii sabhi siten jeetne main kaamyaab rahi thi
 In such a situation, the BJP may be able to save more than half of its seats in a collapsed state, but does not want to lose all seats by making Vasundhara angry

 The BJP got more than two-thirds majority in the 2013 assembly elections
 163 seat vasundhara ke netritv main mili thim jabaki congress sirf 21 siton par simat gai thi
 In 2008, the BJP came under the leadership of Vasundhara
 2008 main congress ko 96 seat mili thim to bijepi ko sirf 78 seat mili thi
 But in 2003, under the leadership of Vasundhara, BJP got 120 seats while Congress got only 56 seats

 Former Sports Minister Sunil Dutt had said that the organizing committee should be headed by someone 'sports-nominated by the government' like Sports Minister, while Manishankar Iyer, who was the Sports Minister after him, criticized the committee for wastage of funds
