 Opener Gautam Gambhir, who was part of the 2011 World Cup winning team, says that victory in any match gives the team, not the captain
 maujuuda satr main shandaar form main chal rahe gambhir kii captaini main buudhvaar ko india blue ne dalip trophy khitaab apane naam kiya
 Indian Premier League (IPL) Kolkata Knight Riders captain Gautam Gambhir has been out of the national team for a long time
 rashtriya team ke saath gambhir kaa aakhri match 15 agast, 2014 ko da ovel main england ke khilaaf hua test match tha
 On not getting a place in the Indian team despite a good performance in the Duleep Trophy, Gambhir said, 'my job is to keep scoring runs
 aap jeet hasil karne ke liye khelte hai, na ki apane chayan ke liye
 'who is better in virat-kohli,' said Gambhir India has to play a three-test series against New Zealand from September 22, in which young Virat Kohli is being led by the Indian team
 ek samaaroh main gambhir se bhartiya captain viraat kohli or kiwi team ke captain ken vilayamsan main behatar captain ke bare main poocha gaya, to unka kahana tha ki match main captain nahin balki team jeet dilaati he
 Gambhir said, 'in any match, the captain does not win you, but the team gives you
 bharat or newjiland team ke captainon main se koun behatar he, iskaa pataa to siries ke baad hi chal paaegaa
 "what does Gambhir have to say about Pink Ball day-night Test Cricket? When asked about the attitude of the Indian team regarding the day-night Test match, Gambhir said," It all depends on the BCCI, but i think that That Test cricket should be played with a red ball
 ’gambhir ne kaha, ‘test cricket main pink ball kaa istemaal nahin kiya janaa chahie
 If you are doing this to increase viewership, this is not correct
 hamen kam se kam cricket ke ek formet ko vaisaa hi rakhana chahie, jaisaa uskaa vajood rahaa he
 On the question comparing India and New Zealand to Team India, the advantage of home ground and spin track, he said, 'I think India has the advantage of playing at home
 aapke paas do behtareen spin gendbaaj hai or agar vah acha khelenge, to kahin na kahin newjiland ko mushkil hogi
 However, Gambhir also said that it is also important to look into the circumstances, because if the spin bowlers are playing on helpful pitches, then New Zealand also has three spin bowlers
 newjiland ke bare main gambhir ne kaha, ‘nishchit taur par mehmaan timbharatiya timka saamana karne ke liye taiyaar hai
 They are a strong team and a special feature of New Zealand is that they have the ability to defeat any team in any circumstance

 loksabhaa chunaav jaise-jaise najadik aa rahe hai, bhartiya janata party or shivasena ke bich bayaanbaji bhi utani hi tikhi hoti ja rahi he
 Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray hit back sternly after the statement of BJP president Amit Shah, who defeated former allies in the event of no alliance, saying that the defeating Shiv Sena is not yet born
 thakare kaa yah bayaan amit shah kii us tippanee kaa jawaab mana ja rahaa he, jisamen unhone gathbandhan na hone kii sthiti main purv sahyogiyon ko patakane kii baat kahi thi
 Criticizing the statement, Thackeray said that i have heard words like 'patak Denge' from someone
 shivasena ko haraane vaala abhi paidaa nahin hua
 Explain that Shiv Sena is a BJP ally in the governments of the Center and Maharashtra
 janvari kii shuruyaat main hi maharashtra ke daure par gaye bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne latur main kaha tha ki agar gathbandhan hota he to bijepi apane sahyogiyon kii jeet sunishchit karegi, lekin agar aisa nahin hua to 2019 ke chunaav bijepi apane puraane sahyogiyon ko haraayegi
 Shah had also spoken of slapping such associates
 haalanki, unhone shivasena kaa naam nahin liya tha
 Uddhav Thackeray's statement is now being seen as a response to Shah's remarks
 modi lahar bhi tippaneeuddhav thakare ne varli ilaake main ek jansabha ko sambodhit karte hue ye baat kahi
 Targeting the Modi wave ahead of the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Thackeray said, 'shiv Sena has seen many waves in its journey
 ' unhone kaha ki bhaajapa se ulat, shivasena ne chunaavon ke pehle ram mandir kaa mudda uthaaya he taaki unka pardaafash kiya ja sake jo hameshaa iskaa upyog chunavi mudde ke liye karte hai
 Thackeray said, 'tell us how the Congress is obstructing the construction of the temple
 congress ko apni kerani kaa fal 2014 main mil gaya
 The party could not even get the post of Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha
 'unhone sawaal kiya ki jab nitish kumaar kii jadyu or ramvilas paswan kii lojpa jaisi bhaajapa kii sahyogi partiyaan virodh kar rahi hai to vah mandir kaa nirmaan kaise karegi
 He said that the BJP should clarify the situation on this

 After separating from the Congress, the Trinamool Congress is considering bringing an adjournment motion under Rule 184 in the Winter Session of Parliament against the policies of the UPA government which provides for voting
 loksabhaa main trinmul congress sansadeey dal ke netaa sudeep bandopadhyaay ne kaha, ‘ham sabhi vikalp khule rakh rahe hai

 ’bandopadhyaay ne kisi party kaa naam nahin liya or kaha, ‘philhal partiyon ke naamon kaa khulaasa karnaa raajnneetik taur par sahi nahin hoga
 He said that the Trinamool Congress, which has 19 members in the Lok Sabha and nine in the Rajya Sabha, will try to coordinate with the Janata Dal (U), Biju Janata Dal and Samajwadi Party in the House against the decisions of the Center
 bandopadhyaay ne kaha, ‘ham agle maheene ke tisare saptaah main sansad ke sheetakaaleen satr kii shuruyaat se pehle sadan main samanvay ke liye in dalon se baatcheet karenge
 He dismissed the possibility of talks with the CPI-M in this regard, saying, "CPI (M) opposition is not true
 iske vipareet vah trinmul congress ko raajnneetik taur par alag thalag karnaa chaahati he
 Trinamool Congress President Mamata Banerjee had earlier said that her party would think about bringing a no-confidence motion against the government
 is bare main puche jane par bandopadhyaay ne kaha, ‘uchit samay par uchit faisla kiya jayega
 He said that his party would also surround the government on the CAG report on coal block allocation
 sansad main kaamkaaj baadhit hone se ittefaq nahin jataate hue bandopadhyaay ne kaha, ‘gat monsoon satr main kareeb 80 pratishat samay sansad main kaamkaaj baadhit hone ke chalate bekaar chalaa gaya
 He said that issues affecting the common man should be actively discussed in Parliament
 jab trinmul saansad se poocha gaya ki kya vah sansad main avrodh ke liye bhaajapa ko jimmedaar tehraayenge to unhone kaha, ‘rajg sarkaar ke dauraan congress ne bhi kai baar is tarah kii niti apanaai
 Therefore both the big parties should be held responsible for this
 ’unhone daawa kiya ki trinmul congress ne sabit kar diya he ki jab centre kii nitiyon ke chalate aam aadmi ke hit prabhavit ho rahe hon to party ne mantri pad kii chintaa nahin kii
 Significantly, the Trinamool Congress withdrew support to the government against the UPA government's decision to bring foreign direct investment into the multi-brand retail sector, limit the number of subsidized domestic gas cylinders and increase diesel prices, and six party ministers including Bandopadhyay Resignation was handed over

 most effective swatchta ambesdervijeta: sachin tendulkarjit kii vajah: apni shoharat or lokapriyata kaa istemaal is baat ko sunishchit karne ke liye ki svachh bharat kaa lakshya hasil ho jaeuse khilne kii aazaadee ho, vah sapane dekh sake, vah swasth rahe, use pine ke liye saaf pani mili, vah skool ja sake or use rahane ke liye saaf-suthri jagah mili—ye sab sahooltein har bachche ko kismat se nahin balki uske haq se milani chahie
 By achieving the goal of Swachh Bharat Mission, we will be able to move closer to a world where the children who achieve all these things will not be called fortunate but will just consider it normal for children
 '' yah baat cricket diggaj sachin tendulkar ne april, 2018 main ek kollam main likhi thi
 The days when he was active in sports, we could hardly hear Master Blaster on any public stage
 ve sari baaten keval apane khel ko hi karne dete the
 Even after his retirement, Tendulkar's nature has not changed and he lets his work speak more than his words
 bas itnaa hua he ki bat kii jagah jhaadoo ne le lee he
 Although Prime Minister Narendra Modi nominated him one of India's 'cleanliness messengers' in 2014, Tendulkar has been promoting cleanliness campaigns in India for nearly ten years
 18 sitambar, 2011 ko ek 12 ghante lambii 'saport maai skool telethan' main unhone deshbhar main 140 sarkari skulon main buniyadi suvidhaayen, khaas taur par bacchiyon ke liye toilet taiyaar karne ke liye chede gaye abhiyaan main 7 karod rupye ekatra karne main madad di jo iske liye rakhe gaye lakshya se 2 karod rupye zyada the
 After becoming a sanitation envoy, Tendulkar launched his first campaign to clean up a locality near his house
 usee saal unhone saansad adarsh gram yojana ke tahat andhra pradesh main puttamaraju kandriga gaanv ko god liya taaki gaanv waalon ko safai va swasthya jaisi buniyadi suvidhaayen mil saken
 He was also a member of the Rajya Sabha from 2012 to 2018
 saal 2016 main is gaanv ko khule main shouch se mukt ghoshit kar diya gaya
 In the year 2017, he adopted another village named Donja in Osmanabad which had been experiencing continuous drought for the past several years
 vahaan unhone safai or pine ke pani kii uplabdhta ke liye dhaancha khadaa karwaane kaa kaam haath main liya
 In the same year, Tendulkar started 'mission-24', aimed at M
 from Mumbai
 east ward main jivan kii gunvattta ko sudhaarna tha
 This ward is considered to have the highest slum population in the city and in the Mumbai Human Development Report 2009, this ward was the lowest rung on the scale of human development among the total 24 wards in the city
 is pariyojna ko do gaiyrsarkari sansthaaon—apnaalay or mumbai fasrt ne brihattamumbai municipal korporation ke saath milakar haath main liya tha
 Its objective was to provide basic facilities like hospitals, schools, water and drainage there
 jo baat tendulkar ko anya duuton se alag karti he, vah he har umr, ling or varg ke logon ke bich unki samaan rup se vyaapt lokapriyata
 Bharat Ratna Tendulkar is active on social media

 report ko saarvajanik nahin karnaa chaahati sarkaarrajya kii manohar laal khatter sarkaarne bhi report aane ke pandraa din baad bhi is maamle par chuppi saadh rakhi he
 If sources are to be believed, there is a pressure on the government not to make this report public and not to give much attention to the matter
 centre sarkaar bif ke vivaad par zyaada ho-hallaa nahin chaahati
 If sources are to be believed, the government wants to avoid this dispute
 sarkaar kii chuppi kaa ek bada kaaran un vibhaagon or unke adhikariyon kii ayogyata bhi he jinako kanoonee taur par namoonay lene kaa adhikaar tha hi nahin
 The whole controversy has proved to be like a storm in a cup of tea after several questions asked on the government

 pakistan ke senadhyaksh rahil sharif 25 janvari ko apane chini samakaksh general kii jiyangju ke saath beijing main japan ke nausena pramukh ne pichley saal jab china kaa daura kiya tha to unhone asia-pacific samudri kshetra main koi spasht rukh lene ke maamle par bharat ke saavdhaanee purna ravaie par apni nakhushi saaf jaahir kii thi
 Admiral Katsutoshi Kawano said, "indian politics is very complex
 ’’ ve is baat kii vajah bataane kii koshish kar rahe the ki aakhir kyon bharat-america malabar samudri abhyaas main hissaa lene ke japan ke anurodh par nai dilli kii ore se gaur nahin kiya ja rahaa he
 But it can now be said with certainty that the Japanese admiral must have felt quite excited by the clear - and for the first time - active view of his role in the region during Barack Obama's visit
 yah bhi spasht rup se kaha ja saktaa he ki duusari ore modi or obama kii ore se prastaavit ‘‘sanyukt ranneetik drushti’’ se china ko takalif hui hogi
 However, the long joint statement of the two countries did not make much headway on this issue
 shaayad sabase zyada mahatvapurn baat yah he ki is kshetra main apni bhoomika ko lekar bharat kaa najariya ab america ke apane ‘‘punarsantulan’’ nazariye se kitna mail khaataa he
 Both countries firmly announced that they would emphasize the importance of "ensuring maritime security" and ensure "freedom of navigation and flights" throughout the region, particularly in the South China Sea
 adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki bharat haalanki pehle bhi ranneetik rup se mahatvapurn dakshini china sagar main nauparivahan kii aazaadee ke vishay par apni ruchi kii baat kah chukaa he, lekin is baar apane nazariye main jis joardaar or spasht dhang se apni sthiti kaa khulaasa kiya gaya he, vah pehle se kahin zyada saahasik he
 Beijing too clearly understood this, which is why he retaliated and responded without delay
 china ne kaha, dakshini china sagar vivaad kaa ‘‘hal un deshon ko milakar karnaa chahie, jo sidhe taur par isse jude hon
 "perhaps the biggest change in the new approach has been that the reluctance that India was showing earlier in getting involved in this matter has now gone away
" pehle vah phoonk-foonkkar kadam rakhte hue china ko naaraaz karne se bachataa tha or yahi baat japani admiral kii khinnata kii vajah thi
 These sensibilities have been sidelined in the joint approach
 isamen ghoshnaa kii gai he ki paanch saal main bharat or america sambhavtaru japan se shuruyaat karte hue ‘‘is kshetra main tisare deshon ko shaamil karke tripaksheeya vaarta pary jor dene kii koshish karenge
 If India is intent on increasing its presence in the South China Sea, then the Modi government also wants to ensure that China considers this effort clearly against itself
 31 janvari se china ke chaar divasiy daure par ja rahi videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj se kaha gaya he ki ve china ko yah vishwaas dilaaein ki modi sarkaar beijing ke saath majboot sambandh bananaa chaahati he, khaskar aarthik morche par
 During Xi Jinping's visit to Gujarat, Modi also tried to convey the same message
 haalanki yah dekhne kii baat hogi ki nae sire se bharat kii punarsantulan kii koshishon par china kis prakaar pratikriya detaa he, lekin bharat ko is baat ke liye taiyaar rahanaa chahie ki china hind mahaasaagar main nai takat se apni ‘‘sakriyata’’ badha saktaa he
 a Chinese Foreign Ministry official told India Today that there is no reason for China to be wary of Obama's visit
 unhone kaha, ‘‘main nahin samajhataa ki 21veen sadi ke vaishvikaran vaale yug main sheet yuddh ke daur vaali maansikta kii koi jagah ho sakati he
 "interestingly, China has also made the same argument on the matter of increasing its presence in Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Myanmar and Maldives in India's neighborhood
" apane nae drushtikon ke baad ab bharat ko bhi isi tarah kii gatividhi sunishchit karne kaa kathin kaam karnaa hoga

 ” dilachasp yah he ki unhone mohammad aarif or chandan pandeya jaise yuva pratinidhi kathakaron kii evaj main prasn tabassum nihaan or vivek mishra ko chunaa, bazaar kaa asal dabaav yahaan dikhaai detaa he
 Even when they "thank" the book's publisher repeatedly, beginning and ending the role
 agar yah sanchayan prakaashak kii hi pariklpana thi to sampadak kii jarurat hi kya thi? bhoomika main susheel siddharth ne paridrishy kaa gambhir or gaharaa vishleshan karne ke sthaan par jaise-taise panne bharne kaa kaam kiya he
 The caution is that they move silently on the communal rise of the ninth decade, calling it the "ayodhya scandal"
 aise hi ve kahanikaron (or kahaniyon) ke kram kaa bhi koi aadhaar nahin dete
 Look at the stories and storytellers they have chosen
 rangmahal main naachi radha (neelakshi singh), mukti prasang (alpana mishra), aaine, sapane or vasantsena (ravi bule), nadi jo ab bhi bahati he (kavita), bazaar main ramdhan (kailash banavaasi), uttar pradesh kii khidki (vimal chandra pandeya), utapia (vandana raag) or khunta (anuj) kaa chayan sachmuch badhibia he
 It would have been better to have selected the stories of Manisha Kulshreshtha, Pratyaksha, Prabhat Ranjan and Umashankar Chaudhary which the readers liked more
 bazaar main ramdhan vah kahani he jo yuva kahani ke aagaman se kaaphi pehle vasudha main prakashit hui thi or is kahani ne udaarikaran-bhumandalikaran kii parighatna ke ain aagaman ke saath bataaya tha ki yah nayaa daur kisaanon or shramjivi janata ke liye kitna mushkil hone vaala he
 Radha topped Nilakshi Singh's Rang Mahal among the stories that have made a big jump while fighting the charm and limitations of Asmitai writing
 adhedavastha chhu rahi gruhinee ke antarman kaa udghaatan neelakshi ne jin saamaajik-saanskrithik sachaaiyon se kiya he vah kahani ko badi kriti banaata he
 If utopia favors the youth story on a worrying issue like communalism, the liberation theme challenges the eternal vision of the male-female relationship
 acha he ki yahaan die gaye aatm-kathyon ke bahaane in lekhakon kii vaichariki or rachana prakriya kii bhi kuch baaten saamne ai hai
 The social, economic and political factors that have been the reason for the arrival of the youth story cannot be evaluated without analyzing it properly
 anyathaa koi to vajah he ki jis peedi ke lekhakon ko lekhan main vishwasaneeyata ke liye yatharth kaa aagrah aavashyak lagata tha, vahi peedi apni rajnatik patibaddhta main samjhaute kar lene main sankoch nahin karti
 Not only this, the uniqueness of the novelty of texture, which may become a hindrance in the communication of the narrative, can be seen in writers of this generation
 baavjood charchit varisht kathakaron ke yah isi peedi ke kathakaar kii vajah se sambhav hua ki alpsankhyak samudaay ke man kii baat ab jaakar aa pai
 Hopefully! a story of Mohammad Arif would have been in this compilation
 baat 30 saal pehle kii he, yani 24 june 1989 ko jab ek top ne loksabhaa main puure vipaksh ko ekajute kar diya tha
 That too when there was no Leader of the Opposition
 satta paksh kaa ek mantri aghoshit rup se vipaksh kaa netaa ban gaya tha
 At the same time 106 out of 110 mps of the opposition resigned
 yah din bhartiya raajnneeti or khaas taur par congress ke liye bhuuchaal laane vaala sabit hua
 The case was of the Bofors scam worth 1437 crores
 jisamen sweden kii company abi boforce or purv pradhanmantri rajeev gandhi kii sarkaar ke saath 155 mimi ke 400 hovitger topon kaa sauda hua tha
 The brokerage and corruption in the Bofors deal in 1986 exposed Swedish radio in 1987
 aarope tha ki company ne saude ke liye bharat ke netaaon or raksha vibhaag ke adhikari ko 60 karod rupye ghoose die hai
 After this, this news also spread rapidly in the country's media
 aarope lagane ke baad kaig ne isaki jaanch kii thi
 The CAG stated in its report that the weapons were purchased in violation of the standards
 iske saath kaig ne yah bhi bataaya ki hathiyaaron kii delivery main jaanboojhkar deree kii gai
 At that time, the Opposition had only 110 mps in the Lok Sabha with 514 seats, notably bjp's (only) 2, Janata Party's 10, Leftist 22, Telugu Desam 30, aiadmk's 12 heads
 106 vipakshi saansadon ne istipha diya tha
 Here, with the strength of the opposition, the weakness of power also came out
 kyonki vipaksh kii ekta ke hero veepi singh the, jo satta se nikal kar saamne aae the
 Then BJP leader and former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had said that we will strongly oppose the corruption related to cannon
 1989 main hi chunaav hone vaale the
 Rajiv Gandhi had full hope of winning the re-election of the Congress government, but suddenly the times changed, politics changed
 lekin vipaksh ke ekasaath aane se pasa palat gaya
 At that time, the opposition did not have a leader, but they all showed unity and plagued the ruling party
 mahatvapurn pad milane ke baavjood veepi singh ban gaye the rajeev gandhi ke kattar aalochaypani eemaandaar chhavi se rattibar bhi samjhauta na karne vaale tatkaaleen rakshaamantri vishwanath pratap singh ne is scandle ko saarvjaanik kar diya tha
 After the CAG report and VP Singh's revelations, the opposition demanded that Rajiv Gandhi resign
 baad main jab rajeev ne istipha nahin diya to vipakshi saansadon ne istipha de diya
 After this, the Congress with an absolute majority, winning 404 seats by solidarity of the opposition, was shaken to its roots
 boforce ghotaale se lekar altitii or srilanka sarkaar ke bich grih yuddh tak kai morch par rajeev sarkaar buree tarah se ghir chuki thi
 VP Singh, who took charge of the Ministry of Defense in the government, emerged as a staunch critic of Rajiv Gandhi
 kyonki rajeev gandhi ne 1987 main veepi singh ke mantrimandal se bhi nikaal diya tha
 After forming the Janata Dal Party and then later the government, angry with all these actions of Bhirajiv Gandhi, Vishwanath Pratap Singh not only resigned from the membership of Congress, but also left his Lok Sabha seat
 is ladaai main arun nehru or aarif mohammad khan jaise kaddavar congressi netaa vishwanath pratap singh ke saath aa khadey hue
 On 11 October 1988, a new political organization called Janata Dal was merged to merge Janmorcha, Janata Party, Lok Dal and Congress (S)
 jald hi, dravid munnetra kadgam (diemke), telegu desham party (tedepa) or assam gana parishad (agap) jaisi kai kshetreey partiyaan bhi janata dal ke saath aa khadi huin
 a coalition was formed by combining these parties together
 jise neshnal front kaa naam diya gaya
 In the 1989 Lok Sabha elections, the National Front won strongly against the Congress
 neshnal front ne is chunaav main kul 244 siton par apane pratyaashee khadey kiye, jisamen 143 ummidavaar chunaav jeetne main safal rahe
 It was not even during the time of Nehru and Indira that if the leader of the opposition left the incident of 24 June 1989, there could never be a strong opposition in the last 70 years
 hameshaa kamjor vipaksh hi dikhaai padaa
 Even today, there is no such thing as opposition in the country
 2014 ke chunaavon ke baad netaa vipaksh banane ke liye bhi kisi dal ke paas sankhya nahin thi
 It is important for the Leader of the Opposition to have at least 10% (55 mps) in a party
 lekin congress ke sirf 44 saansad hi the
 During the tenure of Jawaharlal Nehru, there was never any opposition leader
 kyonki koi dal 10% kii sankhya hasil nahin kar sakaa
 Even during Indira Gandhi, there was no opposition-leader in Parliament for a long time
 desh kii rajdhani dilli main mahila kii kshat-vikshat laash milane se sansani fail gai
 The accused of the murder called the police and informed them about it
 mritka aaropee ke chote bhai kii patni thi
 The accused suspected the character of his sister-in-law
 police ne aaropee ko giraftaar kar liya he
 The deceased's name was Kalavati
 vah ek nijeefactrimen kaam karti thi
 The accused Ramshankar is a merchant of Scrab
 police ke anusaar, rohinee sthit budh vihaar ilaake kii rahane vaali kalavati shuukravaar se laapata thi
 a report of his disappearance was lodged at Vijay Vihar police station
 shanivaar ko ramshankar ne khud police ko phone kiya or bataaya ki usne apane chote bhai kii patni kaa katl kar diya he
 After hearing the confession of the murder, the police also came for a time
 police maukey par pahunchi or ramshankar kii nishandehi par unhone kalavati kii kshat-vikshat laash baraamad kii
 The head and limbs of the corpse were missing
 ramshankar ne bataaya ki usne sir or haath-pair vahaan se guzar rahe ek tempo main daal die the
 He told the police that Kalawati's behavior was not good
 usne kai baar kalavati kosmajhayaalekin vah nahin maani
 Fearing slander in the society, she killed Kalavati
 vahiin police ko shaq he ki ek akelaa insaan katl kii is tarah kii vaardaat ko aakhir kaise anjaam de saktaa he
 At present, the police have arrested Ramshankar
 police aaropee se poochtacha kar rahi he
 The police is investigating the case from several angles
 jab bhi film jagat main bade film nirdeshkon kii baat hoti he usamen japan ke film nirdeshak or screenriter akira kurosava kaa naam bade sammaan ke saath liya jaataa he
 He made his debut in the year 1943 with a film called Sansiro Sugata
 apane kariyar ke dauraan unhone clasik hits die jis vajah se unhen vishvabhar main saraahaa gaya
 Akira Kurosawa was born on March 23, 1910 in Tokyo
 unke pita samurai family se the or ve military afasar the
 While his mother was from the Merchant family
 unke pita bahut sakht mizaaj ke the
 They considered Samurai ethics and values very much
 yahaan tak kii agar unki patni samurai vichaardhaaraon or siddhanton par chalane main chookti thim to ve unhen pratanit karte the
 It also had an impact on Kurosawa's life
 unhone ek dfa kaha tha ki main ek aisi line se aata hum jahaan bina kisi baat ke log kuch zyada imotional rahete hai
 During school days, Akira was called by her companions, Cry Baby
 magar vakt ke saath saath unamem sakaaratmak badlaav hue
 He had defeated his physical teacher in the year 1930
 van Gogh and Cézanne se prerit ho kar ve painter bananaa chaahate the
 But when he realized that he had no qualities to be a special painter, he gave up this dream
 iske baad unhone sahitya kii taraf apana rukh kiya
 But he also felt that he was not very good
 magar baad main jab ve film nirdeshak bane to in donon chizon kaa istamaal unhone apni filmon ke jariye bekhubi kiya

 don't give up midway # akirakurosawa @archanataidea post shared byashish sharma (@ ashish30sharma84) onmay 6, 2019 at 2:08 pm PDT When he was young he had dreams like he is on one side of the railway track and his family on the other side
 
 ek kutta tha jo unke or parivaar ke bich kaa sandesh ek-duusare tak pahunchaata tha
 But at some point a train arrives and bites the dog in half
 is sapane kaa asar un par is kadar padaa tha ki jab bhi ve toona (fish) khaane jate the to unhen ye sapana yaad aa jaataa tha
 Because of this, he did not eat tuna for 30 years
 profeshnal front kii baat karen to unki safal filmon main da seven samurai, rashomone, blad on da thron jaisi filmein shumaar kii jaati hai jise ol time clasik kii shrenee main gina jaataa he
 In 1990, he was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Academy Award
 unhen american diarector jorge lukas or steven spilberg ne ye aword diya tha
 Steven Spielberg said while talking about Akira, "he has been the visual Shakespeare of our times
" ve eklaute aise film nirdeshak rahe hai jinhone marate dam tak filmein bananaa or script likhnaa jari rakhaa
 Regardless of whether these films will fall into the category of classic or not
 ve ek celuloid painter bhi the
 He left a 100 percent impact in the film
 ''da most beautiphul, a vanderphul sande, stree dog, red beards, da bed sleep wel, rain or madadyo jaisi filmein banaain
 The 1993 film Madadayo proved to be his last film
 6 sitambar, 1998 ko japan main unka nidhan ho gaya
 Today, even though Akira Kurosawa may not be among us, the classic films made by him introduce us to different perspectives of life

 com / ct0ychcd1c Every political party in the country leaves no stone unturned to describe itself as farmer friendly
 kisaanon ke karj maafi jaise faislon ko chunaavon main bhunaane main koi kasar nahin chodi jaati
 But if anyone wants to know what is the condition of the farmers at the ground level, then come visit the 7 tehsils (talukas) of Pune district in the grip of drought in Maharashtra
 yahaan kareeb 100 gaanv ke logon ko pani kii boond boond ke liye mashkkat kerani pad rahi he
 The well is dry
 zamin kii 300 feet gaharaai tak par bhi pani nahin he
 The situation has been worse here for the last six months
 tankeron se pani yahaan pahunchaaya ja rahaa he
 The water crisis can be understood from the fact that farmers are forced to feed dirty water to the animals
 insaanon ke nahaane ke baad gande pani ko hi ikattha kar pashuon ko pilaayaa ja rahaa he
 In Vidarbha and Marathwada regions of Maharashtra, the news of drought continues every year
 lekin is baar sookhe ne rajya ke pashchimi hisse ko bhi chapet main le liya he
 As far as can be seen in the drought-hit 7 tehsils of Pune, there is a bad condition
 sukhi fasalen, sookhe kuen, bekaar handpump, zamin main daraaren
 The farmers were only waiting for when the tankers arrived and got some water
 beete 5 saal main ye pehali baar hua he ki pune ke in 100 gaavon ko akaal kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 This is the first time in the last five years that there are 100 such villages in seven taluks of Pune district
 pune ke district magistrate naval kishor ram ne bhi pani ke sankat ko gambhir mana he
 Aajtak / India Today reached the village of Madgurwadi, 80 km from Pune city and took stock of the ground situation
 yahaan prashasan kii ore se bheje pani ke tanker ke paas logon ke jamaavade ko dekhakar hi samajha ja saktaa he ki pani kii samasya kitni vikat he
 The woman first bathed the baby with water and then fed the animal the same water (this photo was clicked by our correspondent Pankaj Khel a month ago), according to village sarpanch Ganesh Midgule, this famine may be even greater than 1972
 midgule ne bataaya ki tab jameen main thodaa pani bachaa tha lekin is saal donon mausam main barish nahin hui
 The sarpanch told that tanker was required only in five months of the first year but this year 8 months of tanker is required
 barish kii ek boond pani nahin padane se logon ko kheti se hatana padaa he
 They have to work hard in the morning by going 30-40 kilometers away
 jisase kuch paisa kamaaya ja sake or gharavaalon kaa pet bharne ke liye anaaj laayaa ja sake
 a woman from the village said that they are using it sparingly to save water
 yahaan tak ki log pani bhi bahut kam pi rahe hai
 Due to this, diseases like urinary tract infection, stones and constipation are increasing
 gaanv ke ek bujurg ke mutabik har parivaar ko do din main ek bairal pani miltaa he
 Elder said that there are 40 animals in his farm and he has to call a water tanker for these unique animals after spending two and a half thousand rupees out of pocket
 ye silsilaa pichley kai maheenon se badastoor jari he
 According to a social worker from Madgurwadi, a canal comes out of the Dimbe dam
 pehle ye nadi madgudwari gaanv ke paas se guzarati thi
 But the canal was constructed away from the village
 ise paas kiya gaya hota to gaanv main bharpoor pani hota
 According to an administrative officer of the Shiur tehsil, the villagers are being provided regular water from the tanker on the demand
 adhikari ke mutabik agar nahar ko gaanv ke paas laane kaa prastaav aata he to use sarkaar ke paas bheja jayega
 The official admitted that if such a step is taken, it can solve the water problem of 15 villages in the area
 pune ke district magistrate naval kishor ram ne bataaya ki jile kii 14 main se 7 tahseelon ko akaal kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 Ram admitted that the crop wasted between 33% and 50% due to low rainfall
 kuen suukh gaye hai or pani 300 foot se zyada neeche chalaa gaya he
 The tanker is transporting water since July
 district magistrate ne bataaya, “pehali baar hua he ki pune jile ke kareeb 100 gaanvon ko pine ke pani kii killat kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 Adequate arrangements have been made by the administration to deliver water from the tanker
 april-june main sankat or gahrayega kyonki tab sookhe kaa prakope badhegaa
 "this time, with the start of the new year, the administration has made fodder for the animals till the end of January
" uttar pradesh ke varanasi main sthit kaashi vishwanath mandir main shraddhalu ab ek ghante sparsh darshan kar sakenge
 For this the temple administration has given permission
 vishwanath mandir ke mukhya karypalak adhikari vishaal singh ne bataaya ki shaam ko saptrushi aarti se pehle baba kaa sparsh darshan sambhav kiya jayega
 This system has been implemented since Friday
 sawan maah se pehle mandir prashasan ne sparsh darshan ko pratibandhit kar diya tha
 On this occasion, a brass vessel has been placed outside the sanctum sanctorum to perform Baba Vishwanath's Jalabhishek, to which the pipe has been connected
 unhone bataaya ki shraddhalu paatr main ganga jal daal dete hai, jahaan se pipe ke madhyam se baba kaa ganga jal se abhishek hota he
 This system was properly implemented throughout the month of Sawan
 is kaaran darshan karne vaale log zyada sankhya main andar nahin ja paae
 With this, the system of the temple was able to run smoothly
 vishaal ne bataaya ki mandir ke andar jagah kam hone se bhakton ko samay adhik lagata tha, is kaaran yah vyavastha sawan main lagu kii gai thi
 There were voices of protest inside inside regarding the new system
 samajha ja rahaa he ki ise dekhte hue mandir prashasan ne pratibandh main dheel dene kaa nirnay liya he
 Significantly, after the end of the month of Sawan, an order was issued at Kashi Vishwanath that Kashi Vishwanath Baba would be seen from outside on the lines of Baijnath Dham located in Deoghar, Jharkhand
 saath hi jalabhishek tathaa dugdhabhishek garbhagrih ke pravesh dwaar par lage paatr main hi kiya jayega, jahaan se pipe ke jariye vah baba ke upar apane aap chadh jayega

 Sanjay Leela Bhansali's film Padmavat was debated in the Supreme Court against the ban in four states
 supreme court ne chaar rajyon main bain ko asanvaidhanik qaraar de diya

 Article 21 of the Constitution violates the right of people to life and freedom
 bench ne rajyon ke notification ko galat bataaya
 The Supreme Court said, this notification violates the rights under Article 21

 madhya or pashchimi bharat main monsoon kii barish main dhimi pragati kii vajah se soyabean, dhan, kapaas, makka jaise kharif fasalon kii buaai main kam se kam do hafton kii deree ho sakati he
 This may eventually lead to a reduction in yields
 arthvyavastha se sidhaa judaavbharat main hone vaali kul barish kaa kareeb 70 fisadi hissaa monsoon sijan main hi hota he
 Hence the monsoon has become the basis of the Indian economy
 monsoon kii acchhee barish kii vajah se krishi paidaavaar acchhee hoti he or isse gramin arthvyavastha main teji aati he
 Due to this, there is a surge in the sale of consumer goods like gold, silver to tractors, cars, motorcycles, refrigerators
 soyabean ke utpaadan main kami kii vajah se bharat ko palm oil, soya oil jaise khaadya telon ke aayaat ko majaboor hona padegaa
 On the other hand, a decrease in cotton yields may reduce its exports
 isi tarah bharat chaaval ke maamle main duniya kaa sabase bada niryaatak he, lekin paidaavaar kam hone se iske niryaat par vipareet asar pad saktaa he
 According to the news agency Reuters, farmers have not been able to sow on time due to delayed monsoon rains
 krishi mantralay ke praarambhik aankadon ke mutabik abhi tak 2

 gauratlab he ki is maheene monsoon dakshin bharat ke rajya kerala main saamaanya samay se ek hafte kii deree se pahunchaa he
 The progress of the monsoon was further delayed due to cyclonic wind
 june main abhi tak monsoon kii barish main saamaanya se 43 fisadi kam rahi he
 In many states like Maharashtra, rainfall has come down by 68 percent

 VIDEO: Family met Kulbhushan Jadhav in Pakistan VIDEO: pakistan main kulbhushan jadhav se mila parivaar \ Most people living in cities have a picture of the village as uneducated people working in raw houses, rough roads and fields
 lekin sach to yah he ki ab gaanv sholay ke dinon vaale gaanv nahin rahe, unamem jabardast badlaav aa chukaa he
 For the last few years, rural India is growing faster than urban India and now studies of most organizations are just catching up on the information that our company Indicus partners have already gathered
 neshnal sample survey (eneses) ke anusaar, 2004-05 or 2009-10 ke bich gramin berogari main 39 lakh kii kami ai he
 Income of the people of the village is also increasing rapidly
 2011 kii credit suis report ke anusaar gramin bharat kaa prati vyakti sakal gharelu utpaada (jidipi) shahari bharat ke mukaable 1
 Has increased by 5 percent
 gramin bharat main jahaan yah badhat 6
 2 percent, while only 4 in urban India
 7 fisadi hui he
 According to the CRISIL report prepared by Dhamakriti Joshi based on NSS data, the expenditure of rural households between 2009-10 and 2011-12 is 3
 7 lakh karod (trillian) ru
 Has increased to Rs
 3 lakh crores while urban households spend Rs
 se kam rahaa he
 During this period, the growth rate of rural India has been 2%
 is bich, shiksha hasil karne main gramin bharat shaharon ke mukaable zyada teji se aage bad rahaa he
 Talking about the assets of families, people of rural India are using more two wheeler and TV (see graph)
 yah badlaav sirf krishi kii utpaadakta main sudhaar (maamuli), yaa naregaa (oont ke munh main jira se kuch zyada) yaa oonche nunatam samarthan mulya (kuch jins hi gramin arthvyavastha ke chote hisse ko cover karti hai) kii vajah se hi nahin hua he
 There has been a huge and obvious improvement in productivity in rural India (although there is no written evidence for this) including the improvement of manufacturing and service sectors
 aaj gramin arthvyavastha kaa kareeb teen-chathai (spasht rup se 73 fisadi) hissaa sarvice or menufairing kaa he or yah hissaa aage or bhi badaae kii sambhaavna he
 The productivity improvement of rural India came from three types of development or reforms that took place in the 2000s
 pehla, samooche bharat main telecom network kaa failaav
 Access to telecom service in rural India 0 in 2000
 7 fisadi pariwaron se badhkar 2011 main 33 fisadi se zyada ho gai he or ise abhi badhate hi janaa he
 During this period, the overall growth of telecom in rural India was 19 times, while it increased 6 times in urban India
 is network kii vajah se duusare deshon ke vipareet bharat main nichle tabake ke logon ko bhi kifayati sevaayen zyada maatra main unchai ja saki hai
 It is known to all that the daily wage laborers are getting better employment opportunities, farmers and fishermen are getting good prices for their products and the youth are getting more education options
 doosraa bada sudhaar tha, gramin kshetron main acchhee sadakon kaa jaal bichaana
 Because of this, all the villages could be connected to each other and big markets
 2004 or 2008 ke bich pradhanmantri gram sadak yojana ke tahat gramin sadakon kii lambaai teen guna badhkar 1,61,000 kimi ho gai
 Rural roads accounted for only 2 per cent of the total roads in 2004, but by 2008 it had increased to 5 per cent
 asal main yah or bhi badha he, lekin is bare main naveenatam jaankaree uplabdh nahin he
 Private transport services, motorcycles started appearing on these roads all the time and private transport, transportation of goods and services to the villages was started at cheap and regular rates throughout the year
 lekin aashcharya kii baat he ki bharat ke shahar kendrit acadmic varg ne is krantikari vikaas or utpaadakta par unke asar ko samajhane kii koshish nahin kii
 The third largest development is perhaps the most important and is the result of improvements in communication and transport
 gramin bharat main human capital (maanav sansaadhan) main kaaphi teji se sudhaar ho rahaa he
 It is known that many government schools do nothing, but there are few who praise the improvement that is coming in them
 aaj gramin bharat main mushkil se hi koi aisa baccha dikhegaa jo skool na jaataa ho
 Now teachers are also ready to teach in rural areas as it has become easier to travel from nearby towns or cities to villages
 gaanv ke yuva shiksha ke liye paas ke shaharon tak roj aate-jate hai
 As a result, according to NSS data, between 2004 and 2010, the number of secondary, higher secondary, graduate and post-graduate people in the working population of rural India increased by 45, 60, 39 and 28 percent respectively
 is
 jaise ki hamane is ank main kai udhaaharan shaamil kiye hai, behatar shiksha hasil karne vaale gramin logon main se kam-se-kam kuch to gaanvon main hi ruk jate hai
 This group of successful rural people is quite different from the people of the past
 ve na sirf gaanvon main badlaav ke junun yaa adarsh se prerit hai, balki unhen is baat kaa bhi puraa bharosa he ki ve or unka parivaar gaanv main hi khushhaal, santoshjanak jivan ji sakate hai
 They are taking advantage of the progress and contributing to it
 yah vah bhartiya he jo gramin bharat ko sabase zyada badal rahaa he-ek adarshavaadi ke rup main nahin balki ek yathartwaadee ke rup main jo avasar dekh rahaa he or gramin bharat main chal rahi nai tej lahar main sakriyata se bhagidaari kar rahaa he
 Therefore we will now begin to see the emergence of a prosperity cycle
 behatar shikshit log jab baari avasaron kaa upyog karenge to ve phir dusron ke liye bhi jagah banaaenge
 Instead they will ensure that at least some part of the better education and active entrepreneurs are ready to work in rural India
 inamen kuch log shaharon main rahete hue bhi aisa kar sakate hai kyonki behatar transport vyavastha se lambii duuri tak yatra karnaa ab aasaan ho gaya he
 However, Indian policy-makers are unable to understand two important features of this cycle
 ye aam taur par kuch samay hi rahane vaale hai or phir khatm ho jaaenge, jab tak ki aise ilaakon se bahari duniya ke logon ke liye vastuon or sevaaon kii mukt rup se awajahi nahin hoti
 The second thing is that rural India can progress only when urban India works in an efficient manner
 kai nithlle vichaarkon ne gramin bharat ke ubhaar ke peeche mukhya vajah naregaa or oonche krishi samarthan mulya ko bataaya he jabaki in daavon ko sabit karne ke liye aankade nadaarad hai
 If this big change in rural India has come due to welfare schemes, then it seems that India has discovered a completely new model of growth! Growth can only be sustainable when productivity is improved and this improvement is sustainable The economy should be opened up
 lekin gramin bharat ab bhi aanshik rup se khuli hui arthvyavastha hi he
 Law, infrastructure, procedures, behavior and corruption together make the countryside like islands surrounded by high walls
 technology kabhi-kabhi in deevaaron se riskar pahunchati he or ek sakaaratmak lahar paidaa kar detii he
 This is exactly what happened in the second half of the 2000s
 lekin chaahe sinchai vyavastha ho, mandi, hive, maal godaam, prashikshan sansthaaen yaa ajeeb se kanoon, gaanvon main ab bhi kaaphi kuch nahin badla he
 The more activity we are witnessing, the more we will see that rural India is coming under the grip of fatigue
 sudhaaron or nivesh kaa shahari bharat ko kuch laabh mila he or kuch riskar gramin ilaakon tak gaya he
 But as urban India continues to be troubled by expectations, the condition of rural India will soon be the same
 shahar or gaanv kuch nahin balki acchhee tarah se band makaan hai jinke bich-bich main kuch bazaar bikhare hue hai
 But the large group of people living in the cities will have to play an important role in making the small groups living in the villages sustainable and give it height
 shahar vastav main gaanvon ko is baat ke liye sakasham bana sakate hai ki ve aarthik tarakkee kaa phayda uthaa saken
 So if rural India is to move forward then Indian cities will have to do well
 aakhir kuch aisi hi to vajah thi ki krishi kendrit mahaan sindhu ghati sabhyataa main shaharon ke patan hone ke baad puri sabhyataa hi kumhala gai
 Very little can be expected or expected from the government of this time, but future policy-makers please keep this in mind
 gramin bharat teji se bad saktaa he or use baduya bhi chahie, lekin iske liye hamen un tamaam deevaaron ko hataanaa hoga jo hamaare bade-bujurgon ne raste main khadi kar rakhi hai

 One of the best finishers in the world, Dhoni's main reason for not reaching the half-century so far is his lower order
 vah apane kariyar main paanchaven or chathe number par 13-13 baar ballebaaji ke liye utre jabaki bahut kam over yaa phir lakshya hasil karne ke liye kam ran bache the
 This is the reason why he has been unbeaten 16 times so far in his career

 India were then 10 runs away from the target and Dhoni needed five runs for the half-century

 The record of scoring the most two centuries and the most 12 fifties in T20 international cricket is named after New Zealand's Brandon mccullum
 morkal or amala bhi hai is list mendhoni ke alaava kai anya nami ballebaaj hai jinhone ab tak tii20 main ardhashatak nahin lagaaya he

 An open view of how the police are harassing businessmen in Uttar Pradesh was seen in Kanpur on Thursday
 jahaan police ne apane gudwork ke chakkar main ek vyapaaree ke lakhon rupee ko hawala kaa paisa bataa kar jabt kar liya, jabaki inakam tex team ne jaanch ke baad is paise ko sahi batya tha or inakam tex pe bataaya tha
 The most embarrassing thing about this revelation of the police was that when the owner of the money reached the SSP along with hundreds of people of the business circles, to tell the SSP the reality, then the SSP heard the businessman and told his soldiers to get him out of his office
 tarif dijie ki inakam tex ne ek baje vyapaaree or police ko vyapaaree kaa paisa sahi he, yah letters de diya tha, lekin kanpur esaspi ne 5 baje yah press conference kar di ki yah paisa hawala kaa he
 And when during the press conference, businessman Radheshyam along with his business circle reached out to SSP Yashaswi Yadav for his complaint, he got him out saying how he came here without permission
 esaspi kanpur yashasvi yadav kaa kahana he, 'harbans mohaal police ko smagaling or hawala rokane main ek badi kamyaabi mili he
 Radhey Shyam, a businessman, has been arrested with Rs 7 lakh
 inke paas koi bhi kaagaj nahin the
 We have seized the money
 kehete hai kate-fate noton kaa dhandha karte hai
 On Wednesday, the police stopped the business of businessman Radheshyam during checking at Ghantaghar in Kanpur, in which he got Rs 6,91,000
 police is rupee or vyapaaree ko lekar harbans mohaal thane pahunch gai jahaan vyapaaree ne bataaya kii meraa paisa 1 number kaa he
 i am bringing it from Banaras
 police ne subah inakam tex ke assistant diarector tarun kushvaha se jab noton kii checking karai to unhone vyapaaree ke kaagaj dekhne ke baad 1 baje yah report di ki paisa inakam tex ped he
 Therefore, the money should be released to the businessman, but the police, under the greed of goodwork, arrested the businessman and his money, and made a press conference at 5 o'clock that it was hawala money
 jab vyapaar mandal ke saikadon log inakam tex kaa letters lekar esaspi ko hakeekat bataane gaye to unhone apane gudwork ke laalach main unhen baahar nikalava diya
 Kusal Bhatia, leader of the trade board, said, 'the vehicle of our acquaintance stopped the police on Wednesday
 unka paisa lekar thane gayi the
 The merchant had told that the money is right
 inakam tex adhikari tarun kushvaha ne bhi paisa sahi hone or relies karne kaa aadesh diya lekin police ne gudwork ke chakkar main abhiyukt bana diya
 'making the businessman accused for the good work of Kanpur Police is not a new case
 iske pehle bhi police ke kai aise kaale karname saamne aa chuke hai, lekin is baar afsos is baat kaa he ki jab inakam tex kii report vyapaaree ko sahi bataa rahi he to esaspi ne kiske dam par vyapaariyon kii fariyaad sune bagaiyr baahar nikalava diya
 Will the Akhilesh government attract businessmen in Uttar Pradesh with the help of such officers and good work
 kisi bhi kaam kaa safalataa or naakaami ahm hissaa he or kisi bhi kaam ko karne vaale shaks ko kai baar naakaami bhi haath lagati he

" ”is vichaar ke baad 30 varshiya nidhi yadav kii jindagi badal gai
 With the help of his father educationist Vasudev Yadav, he started bringing abandoned indigenous breed cows from different parts of the country to the village

 Where only Sahiwal and Gir are Indian cows of the breed
 aise main sawaal yah uthta he ki yahaan gomata kii seva hi ho rahi he yaa bijness kaa khwab bhi aage bad rahaa he

 a French company has given the Organic Certificate to the Godham crop
 baaki kisaanon kaa gehun jahaan 1,400 ru
 The quintal sells while the Godham wheat costs Rs 2,500
 quintal
 The cows here give 15 to 20 liters of milk daily, which is slightly less than cows of foreign breed, but the cost of maintenance of these cows is not even half of the expenditure on foreign cows
 nidhi ke software ejeeniyar pati prabhaat kumaar chutki lete hai, ''inhen itani phikr to adya (nidhi kii 4 maheene kii beti) kii bhi nahin he, jitani gaay ke bachhadon kii rahati he

 Godham's milk customers include Allahabad High Court judges, big government officials and the city's sweets shops
 lekin nidhi ko andaja he ki yah to bas shuruyaat bhar he
 They are engaged in how to convert Godham into a 'dairy plant'
 unki muhim kaa samarthan karte hue unke pita vasudev yadav kehete hai, ''agar ham samaaj ko yah dikhaa saken ki gaay paalna aaj bhi munaafe kaa sauda he, to shaayad hamen un manahuus manjaron se nijaat mil jaae, jisamen gaay sadakon par polithine or dar-dar kii thokaren khaati dikhti hai

 19 varsh ke rishabh pant ke liye yah ek tarah se ranjai trophy main shandaar pradarshan kaa 'inaam' mila he
 This pompous wicket-keeper batsman from Delhi has got a place in Virat Kohli-led T20 team
 rishabh, australia ke purv cricketer adam gilcrist kii wicketcaping or ballebaaji ke mureed rahe hai
 The special thing is that Rishabh, like Gilchrist, bat with the left hand
 maujuuda gharelu sijan main jharkhand ke khilaaf ranjai itihaas kaa sabase tej shatak jamaakar unhone iskaa parichay bhi diya
 Pant, who was a member of the Indian team in the Under-19 World Cup in Bangladesh, first came into the limelight when he scored 78 runs in just 24 balls against Nepal
 pant ne is pari ke dauraan mahaj 18 gendon par ardhashatak puraa kiya jo under -19 worldcup ke pichley record (19gend) se ek gend kam tha
 Rishabh consistently scored well in this prestigious competition
 toornament ke chah maichon main unhone 44
 267 runs at an average of 50 (strike rate 104
 29) banaae jisamen ek shatak or do ardhashatak shaamil rahe
 During this, he made 33 fours and 9 sixes while making stormy bats, i
e
 he scored 186 runs out of his 267 runs through fours and sixes
 tippaniyan In the Under-19 World Cup, Pant was the highest run-scorer in India after Sarfaraz Khan
 is shandaar pradarshan ke baavjood rishabh ko is baat kaa malaal rahaa ki ve team india ko champion nahin bana paae
 In the final, the Indian team lost to West Indies
 vaise rishabh ke lihaaj se yah worldcup behtareen anubhav rahaa or junior team kaa kaa sadsy rahete hue unhen coach rahul dravid se kaaphi kuch seekhney ko mila
 Apart from fast batting, Pant has also been vigilant behind the wicket
 aise main unhen senior level ke cricket (vanade or tii-20) main mahendra singh dhoni ke vikalp (sanyas lene kii sthiti main) ke rup main dekha jane laga he
 Born on 4 October 1997 in Uttarakhand, this journey of Rishabh's cricket has been a struggle
 cricket main behatar maukey kii talash ke liye ve dilli aae or apni pratibha kii dam par jald hi yahaan kii under-19 or phir dilli senior team main sthaan bana liya
 Playing for Delhi, Rishabh wanted to start the innings with Virender Sehwag in the Ranji Trophy, but this could not be possible because in the last season, Sehwag played Ranji matches for Haryana instead of Delhi
 bhartiya tii20 team main sthaan banane ke baad ab yah dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki rishabh ko plaing 11 main sthaan mil paata he yaa nahin
 By the way, by sharing the dressing room with the legendary players like Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Virat Kohli, they will also get a chance to learn a lot
 
 
 bangladesh main hue under-19 worldcup main bhartiya team ke sadsy rahe pant kaa naam sabase pehle tab surkhiyon main aayaa jab unhone nepal ke khilaaf maatr 24 gendon par hi 78 ran thoke
 Pant completed a half-century off just 18 balls during this innings, which was one ball short of the Under-19 World Cup previous record (19 balls)
 is pratishthit pratiyogita main rishabh ne lagaataar acha score kiya
 He scored 44 in six matches of the tournament
 50 ke ausat se 267 ran ( strike rate104
 29) Made with a century and two half-centuries
 is dauraan tufaani ballebazikarte hue unhone 33 chauke or 9 chakke jamaaye yani apane 267 ranon main se 186 ran unhone chaukon-chhakkon ke jariye hi bana daale
 The comments under-19 worldcup main pant, sarfaraj khan ke baad bharat ke sabase adhik ran banane vaale batsman rahe
 Despite this great performance, Rishabh felt that he could not make Team India the champion
 final main bhartiya team ko westeindies ke haathon haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 By the way, this World Cup was a great experience for Rishabh and as a member of the junior team, he got to learn a lot from coach Rahul Dravid
 teji se ballebaaji ke alaava pant wicket ke peeche bhi chaukas pradarshan karte rahe hai
 In such a situation, he is seen as an alternative to Mahendra Singh Dhoni in senior level cricket (ODI and T20) (in case of retirement)
 4 oktober 1997 ko uttarakhand main janme rishabh ke cricket kaa yah safar sangharsh bharaa rahaa he
 He came to Delhi in search of a better chance in cricket and quickly got a place in the U-19 and then Delhi senior team on the basis of his talent

 Born on 4 October 1997 in Uttarakhand, this journey of Rishabh's cricket has been a struggle
 cricket main behatar maukey kii talash ke liye ve dilli aae or apni pratibha kii dam par jald hi yahaan kii under-19 or phir dilli senior team main sthaan bana liya
 Playing for Delhi, Rishabh wanted to start the innings with Virender Sehwag in the Ranji Trophy, but this could not be possible because in the last season, Sehwag played Ranji matches for Haryana instead of Delhi
 bhartiya tii20 team main sthaan banane ke baad ab yah dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki rishabh ko plaing 11 main sthaan mil paata he yaa nahin
 By the way, by sharing the dressing room with the legendary players like Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Virat Kohli, they will also get a chance to learn a lot
 
 
 4 oktober 1997 ko uttarakhand main janme rishabh ke cricket kaa yah safar sangharsh bharaa rahaa he
 He came to Delhi in search of a better chance in cricket and quickly got a place in the U-19 and then Delhi senior team on the basis of his talent

 ) himant biswa sharma assam main congress ke bade netaaon main shaamil rahe hai lekin 2015 main vah congress kaa haath chhodkar bijepi main shaamil ho gaye
 The image of Himanta Bishwa Sharma has been that of a young leader and one who speaks without a trace
 aksar unke bayaan surkhiyaan ban jate hai
 At present, he is standing in favor of the Citizenship Amendment Bill
 unka yahaan tak kahana he ki agar naagarikta sanshodhan bill paas nahin kiya gaya to assam ke 19 jile pakistan ban jaaenge
 Hemant Biswa Sharma believes that if Bangladeshi refugees are not sent to their country, then one day it will come that the people of Assam will become a minority in Assam
 duusare desh se aane vaale hindu sharnaarthiyon ke bare main unki manyata he ki jahaan is community ke saath anyaay hota he or vah bharat kii naagarikta maangate hai to hamen deni chahie
 Muslim leader Asasuddin Owaisi has even said that Himanta Bishwa Sharma is trying to divide the country but Himanta is not deterred by his ideas
 himant bishwa sharma kaa janm jorhat main 1 farvari 1969 ko hua
 He married Rinke Bhuyan Sharma
 sukanya sarma or nandil biswa sharma unki santan hai
 His father's name is Kailash Nath Sharma and mother's name is Mrinalini Devi
 2001 se lekar 2015 tak vah jalukbaari vidhansabha se congress ke vidhayak chune jate rahe
 In 2015, he left the Congress and joined the BJP
 himant ne kaha tha ki vah bhaajapa kii vichaardhaara se prabhavit hokar congress chhod rahe hai
 He had said that all the people of the country except Sonia and Rahul should join BJP
 himant ne yah bhi aarope lagaaya tha ki congress main koi loktantr nahin he
 It is difficult for an MP and MLA to meet Rahul and Sonia
 kya aap soch sakate hai ki aap rahul or sonia ke saath ek dining teble par baithkar khaanaa kha sakate hai, nahin lekin bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah ke daravaaje har kaaryakarta ke liye khule rahete hai
 Himanta's opponents say that he is adept at anticipating situations
 isliye vah congress sarkaar main bhi mantri the or bijepi sarkaar main bhi mantri hai
 Some leaders who know him closely also say that he had recognized the pulse of the public and he came to know that in the election of 2016, the public is in a mood of change
 unka yah bhi maananaa tha ki agar vah vidhayak ban bhi gaye to bhi unke aage badhane ke raste main mushkilen khadi ho jaaengi or himant sharma jaise jujharu or gatisheel raajnneetijna ko yah manjuur nahin tha
 It is also said in the political circles that he wanted to become the CM but Tarun Gogoi was coming in the way
 duusari ore bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah aise netaaon kii talash main the jinaki assam main pahchaan ho or party un par bharosa kar sake
 Himant joined the BJP and helped to grow the BJP in the entire North East and remained alive for the party
 sarbanand sonoval se bhi unki tuning acchhee he or sarkaar banate hi unhen mahatvapurn mantralay saunpa gaya
 In Tripura too, Himanta helped to form a BJP government and succeeded in getting many and many Congress leaders into bjp's side
 himant vivaadit bayanon ke liye bhi jane jate hai
 Once he said that people get cancer due to sin and this is the justice of God
 isko lekar puure desh main babaal machaa
 Former Union Minister Chidambaram had taken a dig at him saying that the same happens with leaving the party
 sharma ne chidambaram par joardaar hamalaa bolaa tha or unhen congress chhodane kii yaad dilaai thi
 On the cancer statement, he said that his statement was twisted and presented
 vah hindu dharm ke karm siddant kii baat kar rahe the
 He apologizes if his statement hurts anyone's feelings

 Scientists have had a major breakthrough in the treatment of viral diseases and cancer as a protein
 chuhon va maanav koshikaon par kiye gaye test ke mutabik, yah protein cytotoxic (hanikaarak koshikaon ko maarane vaala) tii koshikaon kii sankhya badhaane main madad karata he, jo cancer koshikaon va vishaanuon dwaara sankramit koshikaon ko khatm karata he
 Professor Philip ashton-rickart, head researcher at Imperial College London, said, "cancer cells have the ability to limit the activity of t cells, due to which the immune system has no significant effect on them
 " Cytotoxic t cells are an important part of the immune system, but when they are confronted with cancer cells, they increase their numbers drastically to combat them
 shodhakartaaon ne chuhon kii ek aisi prajati khoji he, jo vishaanuon se saamana hone par saamaanya chuhon kii tulana main 10 guna adhik sankhya main cytotoxic tii koshikaon kaa nirmaan kar saktaa he
 These mice suppress infection more effectively and are more resistant to cancer
 tippaniyan In addition, they form another type of t cells (memory cells), which identify and combat previous infections more effectively
 darasal, atyadhik pratiraksha shakti vaale ye chuuhe baari str par ek agyaat protein kaa nirmaan karte hai, jise shodhakartaaon ne limphosite expension moulicul (eliem) kii sangya di he
 This finding is highly unpredictable, as there was no prior information about this protein and it is completely different from existing known proteins
 eshton-ricart ne kaha, "ek sakriy eliem jin ko cancer rogi kii tii koshikaon main pratyaropit kar rogi kii sthiti main sudhaar laayaa ja saktaa he
 "this study is published in the journal 'science'
 imperial college landan ke pramukh shodhakarta professor philip eshton-ricart ne kaha, "cancer koshikaon main tii koshikaon kii gatividhiyon ko simit karne kii kshamta hoti he, jiske kaaran pratiraksha pranali un par koi khaas prabhaav nahin daal paati
 " cytotoxic tii koshikaayen pratiraksha pranali kaa mahatvapurn hissaa hai, lekin jab unka saamana cancer koshikaon se hota he, to unase mukaable ke liye ve apni sankhya ko baari maatra main badha leti hai
 Researchers have discovered a species of mice that, when confronted with viruses, can produce 10 times more cytotoxic t cells than normal mice
 ye chuuhe sankraman ko zyada prabhavi dhang se dabaate hai or cancer ke prati adhik pratirodhi hote hai
 The comments iske alaava, ye ek anya prakaar kii tii koshikaon (memri koshika) kaa nirmaan karte hai, jo purv main hue sankraman kii pahchaan kar adhik prabhavi dhang se unka muqabla karte hai
 Indeed, these mice with extremely high immunity produce a largely unknown protein, which researchers have dubbed the lymphocyte expansion molecule (LEM)
 yah khoj behad apratyaashit he, kyonki is protein ke bare main pehle se koi jaankaree nahin thi or yah maujuuda gyaat protein se bilkul alag he
 ashton-rickart stated, "the patient's condition can be improved by transplanting an active LEM gene into cancer cells' t cells
 " yah adhyayan patrika 'science' main prakashit hua he

 On Monday, the staff of Wadia Hospital reached the Marine Drive police station and accused Preity Zinta that she was taking wrong advantage of the law made for women
 staff main mahilaayein bhi shaamil thim
 According to sources, 10-12 employees of Wadia Hospital reached the Marine Drive police station on Monday
 unhone police main di shikaayat main kaha ki itane saal saath rahane ke baad bhi priti jinta chhedchhad kaa aarope laga rahi hai
 He accused Preity Zinta of misusing the section of molestation
 vahiin mumbai police ness wadiya ke khilaaf lage aaropon kii jaanch main juty he
 Police have recorded the statements of two people while the statement of IPL CEO Sundar Raman is yet to be recorded
 iske alaava police ne priti jinta ko bhi i-mail likhakar bayaan darj karaane kii baat kahi he
 Preity is currently out of India
 police is maamle main ness wadiya or priti jinta ke i-mail acount bhi khangaalegi, priti jinta ne kaha tha ki unhone ness wadiya ko i-mail likhaa tha jiske jawaab main wadiya ne unhen chetavanee bharaa i-mail likhaa tha
 Apart from this, evidence is also being collected through CCTV
 gauratlab he ki priti jinta ne apane ness wadiya ke khilaaf marine drive thane main hi chhedchhad kaa cese darj karaayaa he
 Preity has alleged that Ness molested and misbehaved with her during the IPL match between Kings XI Punjab and Chennai Super Kings on May 30 at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai
 aaropon ke mutabik ness ne priti kaa haath pakadaa or sabake saamne badasluki kii
 The complaint states that Ness abused in front of everyone
 ness ne apni oonchi pahunch kaa hawala dete hue kaha ki wo chahen to priti ko gaayab kara denge
 Preity has also alleged in the complaint that even after the breakup of the two, Ness harassed them several times
 haalanki ness ne aaropon se inkaar kiya he
 He said that he is upset and shocked by these allegations
 duniya maan rahi he ki masood ajahar ek antarrashtriya aatankwaadi he or uskaa banaaya jaish-e-mohammad ek khatarnaak aatanki sanghathan
 Nevertheless, the government of Pakistan is engaged in the involvement of Masood Azhar and the army to wash the terrorist stains of jaish-e-mohammed
 isiilie wo kah rahi he ki jaish namka koi aatanki sanghathan to he hi nahin
 So we tell you five big lies of Pakistan
 1
 Who runs in Pakistan, who walks in Pakistan? Prime Minister Imran Khan or Army Chief Qamar Javed Bajwa or any Masood Azhar
 kisi hafiz said kii
 We are not asking these questions but are raising you to make you aware of the truth that how Pakistan, which hides terrorists in its sleeve, lays down as a secret for any terrorist Masood Azhar and his terrorist organization jaish-e-mohammed
 
 agar aisa nahin hota to pakistan sena kyon masood ajahar ko bachaane ke liye jaish ke vajood ko lekar hi jhooth bolti
 2
 jhooth ko benakaab kiya purv pakistani raashtrapati parvej musharraf neparvej musharraf pakistani army ke chif rahe hai or usase aage taanashaah hote hue raashtrapati
 That Musharraf confessed that he had also given Jaish open permission for terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir
 pakistani sena ko chahie ki pehle apane puraane bos musharraf ko to sun lete
 Now that Musharraf has confessed, then he shows you how Jaish spread terror under his rule
 3
 This terrorist attack by Jaish under Musharraf Raj, Masood Azhar made jaish-e-mohammed in the year 2000 under Musharraf
 usee saal april main badami baag kaint ilaake main car bam dhamaakaa kiya jisamen 30 logon kii jaan gai
 In June the same year, Jaish militants shot dead three soldiers from Jammu and Kashmir
 usee saal disambar main srinagar-baraamula hive par biguef kii gaadi par barudi hamalaa kiya
 In October 2001, a bomb blast in the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly killed 31 people
 janvari 2003 main batmalu bas stand par uske hamale main biguef kaa ek jawan shahid hua
 In November 2005, a car bomb exploded in Naugam killing 10 people
 march 2006 main pulavama main greened atake main 23 logon kii jaan gai jabaki siarpief ke 2 jawan shahid ho gaye
 In May 2006, a human rights commission vehicle was attacked in Srinagar
 or july 2008 main sopor-bandipura road par do police waalon kii hatya kar di
 Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi Nepakistani army is saying that there is no Jaish in Pakistan, then how is its leader Masood Azhar
 pakistan ke is jhooth kii pole to uske videsh mantri shah mahmud kuraishi hi khol chuke hai, jo masood ajahar hindustan kaa gunahagaar he, usko biimaar bataakar pakistan uske aatank ko sangrakshan de rahaa he
 Then why did 44 militant relatives of Masood Azhar have to be detained, India did an air strike in Pakistan after the Apulwama scandal
 iske baad buudhvaar ko masood ajahar ke bhai samet 44 aatanki rishtedaaron ko pakistan ne hiraasat main kyon liya
 Pakistan is lying and its lies have been razed and the Pakistani government and army are trying to cover their shame with those rags
 ganga ko durdasha se ek nayaa mantralay nahin ubaar saktaa or na hi uske liye ‘sabarmati model’ paryaapt hoga

 visheshgyon kaa kahana he ki nadi kaa gaurav behaal rakhane ke liye kanoonee praavdhaanon kii darkaar he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has placed special emphasis on cleaning this 2,525 km river, which is considered the most sacred for crores of Hindus who have settled in every part of India and has been a part of the Puranas and folklore for centuries
 ganga sirf bharat main aasthaa kaa hi ek naam nahin he, balki 11 rajyon kii 40 pratishat se zyada aabaadi ko pani muhaiyaa karaati hui jeevanarekha bhi he

 Environmental scientist and member of National Ganga River Valley Authority (NGRBA) b
 di
 Tripathi said, 'cleanliness is not the solution for Ganga
 teen mukhya dharaaen- bhagirathi, alaknanda or mandakini sabhi par kai baandh or bairaj ban chuke hai
 Due to these, river water is getting absorbed in the land on a large scale
 naharon ke jariye jo pani ganga main girtaa he uski maatra kaaphi kam he
 The National Ganga River Basin Authority (NGRBA) was formed in 2009 under the chairmanship of the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to clean the Ganges
 treepathi ke mutabik nadi prabandhan se jude kai mudde maujuuda vidhaayi dhaanche main nahin aate hai
 This includes environmental flow monitoring, conservation of river basin ecology and biodiversity, maintaining groundwater levels, strengthening plans to divert river water into various streams, debris disposal, river flow obstruction and connectivity erosion and flooding The use of plains and active flood zones etc
 do not fall within the existing legislative framework
 treepathi ne kaha, ‘ganga ek rashtriya nadi he or isiilie rashtriya niti kii jarurat he
 Now that there is a separate ministry, we need to realize the reality that the management of the Ganga should be done under a legal framework at the central level to ensure that the issue related to the river, its flow and its valley across the country The solution should be uniform
 ’ganga kii safai kaa vaada karte hue modi jahaan gujarat kii sabarmati nadi ko udhaaharan ke rup main pesh karte hai, vahiin kaaryakartaaon kaa kahana he ki yah ganga ke liye kahin se bhi upyogi nahin thahartaa
 Sabarmati is the largest river in Gujarat and it originates from Dhebar Lake in the Aravalli mountain range in Udaipur district of Rajasthan
 yah nadi vahaan se dakshin pashchim kii disha main bahati hui 371 kilometre kii yatra ke baad arab sagar ke khambhaat kii khadi main girti he
 It flows from the beginning in Gujarat to the sea and along this side is the state capital Gandhinagar and adjoining Ahmedabad
 yahaan paryatakon ko lubhaane ke liye nadi ke kinaaron ko viksit kiya gaya he
 Environmentalists noted that the Sabarmati has not been cleaned
 keval isamen narmada nadi kaa pani bahaya ja rahaa taaki yah saaf dikh sake
 Himanshu Thakkar, coordinator and environmentalist of the NGO South Asia Network on Dams, said, 'the water that flows into the Sabarmati in Ahmedabad is from the Narmada and is for the drought-hit areas of Gujarat
 ’isi se milti-julati baat toxic vaach alliance ke gopal krishna ne bhi kahi, ‘gujarat kaa jal prabandhan model ganga ke liye kaamyaab nahin ho saktaa, kyonki yah gujarat ke liye bhi upyogi sabit nahin hua he

 Dehradun Senior Superintendent of Police GN Goswami said that the shoe fell after coming 10 meters away from Rahul
 phenkane vaale yuvak kii pahchaan kuldeep ke rup main kii gayi he or use police ne tatkaal hiraasat main le liya
 See in the video how the shoe thrown at Rahul Gandhi was heard by the policemen and Congress workers who immediately caught the young man who threw the shoe at the Vikasnagar city, saying, 'don't kill him
 ’ rahul ne kaha ki yah sochna galat he ki rahul gandhi juuta yaa chappal phenkane par chale jaaenge
 He said, 'if someone wants to get angry, he can throw two or three shoes
 lekin isse mujhe koi fark nahin pad saktaa
 The Congress strongly condemned the bjp's hand behind the whole incident and demanded a thorough investigation to ascertain the truth
 party pravaktaa raashid alvi ne kaha, ‘main isaki ninda karata hum
 This is unfortunate
 kuch samay se bhaajapa kahati aa rahi he ki log sadakon par utrenge or asainya sangharsh ho saktaa he
 Such irresponsible statements encourage these misdeeds
 mujhe nahin pataa ki inke peeche vastav main koun he lekin raajnneetik dalon or netaaon ko is tarah ke bayaan dene se pehle puri saavdhaanee baratani chahie
 External Affairs Minister SM Krishna said, "it is condemnable and we should not promote such acts which are not dignified in our democratic traditions and democratic fabric

 sanjay raut ke is bayaan par kendriya mantri or bijepi netaa muqataar abbaas naqvi ne enditivi se kaha he ki is tarah kii baat karne waalon ko samaaj main alag-thalag karne kii zarurat he
 Such things spoil the atmosphere of peace
 hamaari koshish desh ko taraqqi or shanti ke raste par banaae rakhane kii honi chahie
 At the same time, he has also targeted those who spread hatred among different communities on Twitter
 haalanki apane twit main unhone kisi kaa naam nahin liya he, lekin unke in twits se saaf he unka ishaara sanjay raut keis vivaadaaspad bayaan kii taraf hi he
 This is what i have to say to the Naxalites of hate
 
 
 
 "make the trees that are drying up fruitful, end hatred, love love make love" --- My Hindustan is not a jungle of Taliban thinking, it is a chaman of human values, constitutional values, no hate polluted air can affect it
 darasal shivasena ke mukhpatr 'saamana' main likhe apane lekh main raut ne bal thakare ke bayaan kaa zikr karte hue kaha ki desh main musalamaanon ke matdaan kaa adhikaar chhinane se hi muslim vot bank ke naam par ho rahi siyasat khatm hogi
 In an article published in 'saamana', Sanjay Raut also targeted Owaisi brothers of Mulayam Singh, Lalu Yadav and majlis-e-ittehadul-muslimeen and said that they all used Muslims only for political gains
 haalanki baad main apane bayaan par safai dete hue sanjay raut ne kaha, 'jab tak vot bank kii thekedaari kuch logon ke paas rahegi tab tak musalamaanon kaa bhala nahin hoga, naa unka vikaas hoga
 Shiv Sena chief Bala Saheb Thackeray always said this
 
 
 bala sahib ne 15 saal pehle kaha tha ki ek din agar aap musalamaanon ke matdaan kaa adhikaar kuch dinon ke liye chin lenge to sabko pataa chalegaa
 Today, the way the Owaisi brothers are using the language spreading poison throughout the country, i remembered Balasaheb and i said this
 'raut ke is bayaan par hangaamaa shuru ho gaya
 Congress spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi said that it is also strange to hear, we live in a democracy, not under any Taliban regime
 bijepi ke rashtriya sachiv shrikant sharma ne sanjay raut ke is lekh par kaha, desh savindhan se chalata he, sampadakeey se nahin
 Every 18 year old has the right to vote
 ham unki baat se ittefaq nahin rakhte
 At the same time, MIM MLA Imtiaz Jalil said, why is he saying this, this is democracy
 
 
 ye dharm ke aadhaar par baantne vaali unki raajnneetik soch ko darshata he
 Sanjay Raut's article comes after the by-election in Bandra East, where the Owaisi brothers held strong rallies
 isi ilaake main thakare parivaar kaa ghar matoshri he
 The MIM candidate garnered over 23,000 votes in the last elections here

 The trouble is that both the Trinamool and the CPM are against the creation of separate Gorkhaland, but the attitude of the agitators is telling that this time the state government will have to face more intense agitations and questions
