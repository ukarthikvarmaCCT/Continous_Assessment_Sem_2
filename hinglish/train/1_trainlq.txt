 CM Yogi Adityanath said that the joint government of these two parties was in the state from 1993 to 1995, during this time what was the situation of law and order and anarchy, the people of the state know
 uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri ne kaha ki ye donon partiyaan rajya main purna bahumat se alag alag sarkarein bana chuki hai, is dauraan in sarkaron ne jaateey aadhaar par samaaj ko baanta, jaateey jehar ghola or pradesh ko dangon kii aag main jhonka

 unhone kaha ki basapa ke samay main do teen jile or sapa ke samay main paanch jilon ko hi bijli milti thi

 CM said that till the completion of two years of his government, he will become a state

 Holi has different traditions in different parts of the country
 braj ke ek ilaake main lathmaar holi to duusare ilaake main holi kii alag aakarshak parampara chali aa rahi he
 In such a situation, a trend of Holi in Bihar has taken its own color
 yah chalan he 'kurta faad holi' kaa
 The funny thing is that this tradition of Holi is not limited to men, nor is it a tradition of a particular class
 bihar main holi ke gayan kii apni parampara rahi he or yah varg or kshetra ke hisaab se bantati chali ja rahi he
 The singing of Holi songs gives information about the traditions among the people of the region
 subah ke samay keechad kii holisubah main kaado (keechad) kaa khel chalaa karata tha
 In this, a mixture of cow dung was made with mud, from which Holi was played
 subah 10 se 11 baje tak is holi kaa chalan tha
 In this sequence, the clothes were separated from the body, so that the whole body was painted with mud
 do samoohon main bante log ek-duusare par ise aajamaate the
 After this time, the color started
 isamen daanton ko rangana bahut mahatvapurn tha
 The one who painted was considered the winner and the one who was painted was defeated
 phir gaaliyon kaa daur shuru hota tha
 Singing was sung in chorus
 rangon kaa daur dopaher do baje ke baad khatm ho jaataa tha or tab gulaal or holi gayan kaa daur shuru hota tha
 The singing has ended in changing times but the kurta tearing Holi is alive, because in Lalu Prasad's time, this tradition got a lot of hype and publicity
 aaj yah apane shabaab par he or ise sabhi aajamaate hai
 65-year-old Vrjanandan Prasad of Patna said that if in simple words, Diwali is a cleanliness of our house then Holi is a festival of cleaning our mind
 unhone kaha ki holi kii vaastavik shuruuaat phalgun maheene ke prarambh main hi ho jaati he
 During Holika Dahan a day before Holi, the surrounding garbage ends, then the year begins with a blast of color and gulal

 Three of the four faces that rocked Paris with terror attacks are no longer in this world
 lekin is modul kii iklauti jinda bachi mahila aatanki ab bhi france kii elit police force ke liye ek chhalaava bani he
 The reason for Charlie Abdo's 'crime' is that if the French police are looking for a human at the moment, it is a 26-year-old girl named Hyatt Boumedini
 boumedini yani wo khubasurat bhalaa, jiske sir par super market ke chaar begunaahon ke katl ke saath-saath aatankwaadi harkaton main shaamil hone kaa sangeen iljaam he or jo, saalon se police kii radar par hone ke baavjood har baar police ko dhokhaa dene main kaamyaab ho jaati he
 Know about Hyatt Boumedini, another picture of Hyatt carrying arms in the name of Jehad has been revealed
 tu pis bikni main apane bwoyfrand or liv in partner amedi colibeli ke saath rahane vaali hayaat, jo paris main sabase taaja aatanki hamalon kii sabase badi or jinda gunahagaar he
 It can also be difficult for many people to believe that due to the radical fanaticism, this girl does not even escape from the innocents, while on the occasion, she also lives such a comfortable life
 lekin kehete hai tasviren kabhi jhooth nahin bolti
 According to the French police, Hyatt Boumedini was living with Amédée Coulibelli for many years now, and like Amédée, her history was tainted
 2010 main uski mulaakaat dakaiti ke iljaam main das saal ke liye jail gaye amedi colibeli ke saath ek jail ke baahar hui thi or iske baad se hi donon kii dosti kuch aisi hui ki donon saath rahane lage
 On the other hand, in the jail itself, Supermarket's criminal Amedi met Sharif Kauchi, one of the Kauchi brothers who were involved in terrorist acts
 yahaan amedi kouchi se prabhavit hua or uske baad usne apana dharm badal liya
 According to the French police, it was the Cauchy brothers who met Amédée and his girlfriend Hyatt with a radical religious leader, Jamel Beghal, in the town of Murat, France, and after that Beghal brainwashed the four at his house
 hakeekat yahi he ki is vakt france police ke liye most vanted bani hayaat boumedini kaa naam koi pehali baar police ke saamne nahin aayaa he, balki isse pehle saal 2010 main bhi ek baar france police ne aatankwaadi harkaton ke silsile main usase poochtacha kii thi
 But before any stern action was taken against her, she continued to engage in terrorist antics by dodging the police, and even with her boyfriend, she got her arms training at her high command Beghal's house in Murat
 udhar, hayaat ke bwoyfrand amedi kaa trek record bhi koi acha nahin rahaa
 He was the only brother of his nine sisters
 lekin gharavaalon kii madad karne kii bajaay wo shuru se hi jurm kii duniya main shaamil rahaa
 First he carried out many robbery and robbery incidents and then gradually started drug dealing
 in gunahon main use sajaa hui or wo lambey vakt tak jail main bhi rahaa
 But even the bars of the jail could not rectify him and after getting out he became involved in the so-called jihadi antics
 super market main kahar barapaane ke baad police ne amedi ko to uske gunahon kii sajaa de di
 But her girlfriend, and her journey from bikini to burqa, remains an enigma to the France police
 vaise pichley teen dinon main france ke saath-saath puri duniya ko dahalaanevaale in chaar chehron main se teen to ab dher ho chuke hai, lekin hayaat ab bhi police ke liye ek sirdard bani hui he
 When the police agreed, Hayat was also with Colibelli on Thursday when he targeted two policemen and on his second day in the supermarket, he killed innocent people
 lekin isse pehle ki police use pakadati, wo chakma dekar bhaagane main kaamyaab ho gai or aise main police ko shaq he ki wo ab apane saathiyon kaa badla lene ke liye ab kabhi bhi kisi bhi had tak ja sakati he
 Therefore, the French police have released fresh posters with the tag of Armed and Dangers, including his name Most Wanted

 Bedi said that players who have said goodbye to cricket recently will be well versed with the methods of modern cricket
 unhone kaha, ‘kuch khilaadiyon ne haal hi main sanyas liya he jo aadhunik cricket se acchhee tarah waakif hai

 Muslim Personal Law Board does nothing on triple talaq
 Union Minister for Minority Affairs and BJP leader Dr
 najma hepatulla ne kaha ki british rule ke time par anglo muslim lau tha jo azaadi ke baad muslim personal lau board ban gaya he
 The Muslim Personal Law Board is violating the triple talaq written in the Quran
 quran main likhaa he ki tripal talaaq teen maheene ke proces main hona chaiye
 Thirty years ago, at the time of the Shahbano case, it was said that steps were taken to reform the triple divorce, but after thirty years the situation has become worse than before
 unhone kaha ki muslim personal lau board ek enjio he
 Najma Heptulla said there should be no vote bank politics on triple talaq
 pakistan, bangladesh jaise lagbhag 12 deshon ne tripal talaaq khatm kar diya to yahaan par kya problem he
 Muslim Personal Law Board is lying that the government wants to implement the Uniform Civil Code through triple talaq
 pehle ye jhooth bolaa jaataa tha ki bijepi or aresas muslimon ke kilaaf he
 Najma Heptulla said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has taken a stand on triple talaq
 wo sabakaa saath, sabakaa vikaas ke naare ko dhyaan main rakhkar liya gaya he
 Voices have come from the women of Muslim society to end triple divorce
 unhone kaha ki tripal talaaq ke paksh main jo log hai, wo muslim mahilaon ke kilaaf hai or apane faayde ke liye sochate hai
 a film is coming out on the story of the Batla House encounter
 isliye ek baar phir se bottla house surkhiyon main aa gaya he
 The story of that encounter is also very important because there was a dispute about it
 sawaal sirf ek police or media ke bich kaa nahin tha
 Rather, at that time in political circles too many parties raised questions about this
 bade-bade politician ne bhi is ghatana par bayaan diya tha
 Promising Inspector Mohan Chandra Sharma of Delhi Police was martyred in the Batla House encounter
 13 sitambar, 2008ab bhi bahut se log jaananaa chaahate hai ki bottla house encounter ke baad kya hua tha
 The encounter took place on the morning of 19 September 2008 at Batla House

 Late on 19 September Mohan Chandra Sharma died in the Holi Family Hospital
 postmortem report ke mutabik mohan chandra sharma ko teen goli lagi thi, ek pet main ek jaangh main or ek daahine haath main
 The police blamed Shehzad Ahmed for the death of Mohan Chandra Sharma

 These included the caretaker of the L-18 house

 Meanwhile, human rights organizations filed a petition in the Delhi High Court stating the Batla House encounter as a fake and asking for a judicial inquiry
 is par dilli hai court ne rashtriya maanavadhikaar ayog ko jaanch kar do maheene main report dene ke liye kaha tha
 On 22 July 2009, after investigation, the NHRC submitted its report to the Batla House Encounter and gave a clean chit to the Delhi Police
 26 agast, 2009dilli hoicourt ne is bottla house encounter kii nyaayik jaanch se inkaar kar diya tha
 The court considered the commission's report to be correct
 30 oktober, 2009kuch logon ne hoicourt ke faisle ke khilaaf supreme court main apil daayar kii
 But the Supreme Court also refused judicial inquiry after knowing all the aspects
 19 sitambar, 2010is din bottla house encounter ke do saal puure hue the
 Then came the news that near Jama Masjid, motorcycle riders targeted foreign tourists and fired
 is golibari main do taiwani naagarik ghayal ho gaye the
 a few steps away from the place where the firing incident was carried out, the park suddenly saw smoke coming out of the car and caught fire
 police ne us ilaake ko khaali karaayaa
 a bomb was planted in the car, which for some reason was not blasted
 6 farvari, 2010bottla house encounter ke baad se hi police inspector mohan chandra sharma ke kaatil ko talash kar rahi thi
 Finally, on 6 February 2010, the Delhi Police of Long Bhagadur arrested Shehzad, the murder accused of Mohan Chandra Sharma
 20 july, 2013inspector mohan chandra sharma ke kaatil shahzad ahamed ke maamle main court ne 20 july 2013 ko sunwaayee puri kar lee

 angreji akhbaar, indian express kii khabar ke anusaar pradhanmantri kii ore se lokapal or lokayukta kii niyukti main koi dilchaspee nahin dikhaai gai he
 He said that now he has lost faith in the words of PM Modi

 James Gary, president of the Computer Science Program of Western Kentucky University, said that about 40 students failed to meet their admission standards, while the university also provided them with help
 akhbaar ke mutabik 60 main se 35 chaatro kaa admician main koi gadabadi he or wo uniwarsity se padhai se karenge jabaki 25 chaatr ko campus chhodana padegaa
 If the students failed to meet the admission standards, it would be a mistake to keep these 25 students in the program, because they cannot write even computer programs, which is a very important part of their curriculum, and taught the graduates in America

 in chaatro kaa daakhila bharat main ek pravesh abhiyaan chalaakar kiya gaya tha, jiske tahat recruitaron ne vigyapanon main 'spot admician' tathaa fees main chhot kii peshkash bhi di thi
 University said- this is a lesson for them, after this case, the University of Kentucky has changed the ongoing recruitment process in India
 ab admician ke dauraan uniwarsity ke computer science vibhaag ke sadsy bhi bharat jaaenge, takipravesh ko manzooridie jane se pehle ve chaatro se mil saken
 Meanwhile, Aditya Sharma, president of the Indian Student Association at the university, said that what happened to these 25 students who came to America from India is very shocking

 If the Ram temple is not constructed before the 2019 elections, it would be like cheating the people of the country, for which the BJP and RSS will have to apologize to them
 shivasena ne party ke mukhpatr saamana ke jariye kaha, ''vah (modi) ram ke naam par satta main aae the, haalanki unke mutabik bhagwaan ram kanoon se bade nahin hai
 Now the question is that if the temple will not be built in the majority government then when will it be built
 modi sarkaar ne gujarat main sardaar vallabhbhai patel kii bhavy pratimaa banaai he, lekin ram mandir par pradhanmantri narendra modi ne sardaar vaala saahas nahin dikhaaya
 Also said that it will be recorded in the pages of history
 ''bijepi kii sahyogi party shivasena ne kaha ki ram mandir ke liye andolan 1991-92 main shuru hua tha or saikadon karsevakon ne apni jaan ganvaai thi
 It asked, "who committed the massacre and why?" On the one hand hundreds of Hindu kar sevaks were killed as well as hundreds of people from both sides (hindu and Muslim communities) were killed in the Mumbai bomb blasts

 The Delhi Police was on alert in the first two weeks of January amid warnings of a terrorist attack
 aise ki parinda bhi par na maar sake
 But during this time, street criminals roamed freely
 yah baat dilli police ke aankade kah rahe hai
 Crime graph officials from January 1-15 said that most of the policemen Lutyens were stationed in Delhi
 1 se 15 janvari tak dilli main chori or chhina-jhapati ke 427 maamle darj kiye gaye
 Whereas between 1 to 15 December the number of such cases was 394
 yani ek maheene main hi aise aparaadh 92 fisadi bad gaye
 In 2015, 348 such cases were registered from January 1 to January 15
 gadiyon or gharon kii chori main bhi aisa hi antar he
 kamdcp, run by 40 per cent of the staff, said that after the attack on the Pathankot airbase, staff were taken from the districts for security on Republic Day
 isliye lutiuns dilli ko chhodkar baaki ilaakon main har thane ko 40 fisadi staff se hi kaam chalaanaa padaa
 a large number of police forces were deployed in malls and big markets, despite this, local criminals managed to commit their acts
 yah thi ranneetidilli police ke ek bade adhikari ne bataaya- ranneeti yah thi ki javaanon ko aise tainaat kiya jaae taaki rajdhani ke mal, sadakon or bazaaron main har jagah khaaki dikhe
 This strategy was adopted so that the terrorists and the criminals who supported them lived in awe
 jaanch adhikari kamek varisht police adhikari ne kaha ki cese to darj ho rahe hai, lekin unki jaanch mushkil hoti ja rahi he
 Because the investigating officers are very few
 jo hai bhi ve duusare kaam main vyast ho jate hai
 The investigation is having a bad effect due to less staff

 Aam Aadmi Party's Delhi state convenor and cabinet minister Gopal Rai said that for the last four years, the central government has been doing injustice to the people of Delhi
 dilli sarkaar ke sabhi kaamon main adchane daali ja rahi hai
 We tried everything possible to solve it, but there were no positive results
 hamaari sarkaar banane ke baad may 2015 main centre ke grih mantralay ne notification jari karke dilli sarkaar kii shaktiyon ko chhinane kaa prayaas kiya
 In this context, we also presented our stand before the Center and presented before the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi but no solution was found from anywhere

 Gopal Rai has said that the people of Delhi are facing many problems
 inamen pramukh samasyaayein hai-1
 Why are the votes of Delhiites half the cost of other parts of the country? 2
 dilli kii mehnatee janata sava lakh karod kaa tex centre ko detii he, dilli ko waapas kyon miltaa he keval 325 karod?3
 Why are the colleges of Delhi not admitted to students who have passed 12th from Delhi? Where to go Delhi students? 4
 dilli main noujvaan kyon bhatak rahe hai naukariyon ke liye? koun degaa jawaab lakhon rikt pade padon kaa?5
 Who is responsible for the security of Delhiites? Who is Delhi Police accountable to? 6
 dilli kii chuni hui sarkaar janata ke hiton main faisle kyon nahin le sakati? angrejon ke jamaane se thope hue vysarai-alji sahab afasaron-karmchaariyon kii transfar posting kaise karte hai?7
 Why do the people of Delhi have to beg the Central Government to build a school hospital for the people of Delhi
 8
 Why did the central government snatch the ACB, which stopped corruption in Delhi
 9
 Why the Jan Lokpal Bill is not passed even after three and a half years
 10
 To work for the people of Delhi, the Chief Minister along with his cabinet has to sit in the LG house for nine days
 gopal raay ne kaha dilli kii janata ne centre sarkaar kaa bhi samarthan kiya tha
 BJP candidates were sent to the Lok Sabha on the seven Lok Sabha seats of Delhi, but the BJP still treated the people of Delhi step-motherly
 hamen ummid thi ki shaayad nyaayalay se dilli kii janata ko kuch raahat milegi, parantu vahaan se bhi koi samaadhaan nahin mila

 aazaadee ke baad se ab tak maharashtra main kul 56 kaidiyon ko faansee di gai
 Some of them have been hanged to death in Yeravada jail in Konagpur jail
 nagpur jail main aakhri baar 17 april 1973 ko moriram shadyaji godan ko faansee di gai thi
 a total of 21 people have been hanged in Nagpur jail so far
 agar yaqub ko is jail main faansee hui to vah ye sajaa paane vaala 22waan kaidi hoga
 The first hanging took place 65 years ago, Pantheyadi Nandal was hanged on the gallows on August 25, 1950 for the first time 65 years ago in the Nagpur jail

 Mahendra Singh Dhoni, known by names like Mahi, Captain Cool and MSD, has decided to take rest from the test
 jahaan tamaam purv khilaadi or cricket jaankaar dhoni ke faisle ko sahi bataa rahe hai, vahiin purv cricketer atul vaasan jaise kuch log unke is tarah bich siries main sanyas ke kaaran unki taraf ungali bhi uthaa rahe hai
 Along with Dhoni's captaincy, many people are surprised at the fact that Test cricket is also called a bid
 jo log kal tak dhoni kii captaini or khilaadi ke taur par bhi unki test team main jagah par sawaal uthaate the, ve bhi ab unki tarifon ke pul baandh rahe hai
 There are many people who can be happy with Dhoni's retirement or will be very happy
 kaha ja saktaa he ki dhoni ke test cricket ko alavida kehane se aashcharya hua, dukh bhi hua or khushi bhi, yani total cocktail
 Surprised by sports experts and former players, his fans will now be sad to not see Dhoni in a white jersey
 lekin ek jamaat aisi bhi he, jo captain kool ke sanyas se khush ho sakati he
 This is the group that was marginalized from the beginning of Dhoni's international cricket career on December 2, 2005 or on December 23, 2004
 dhoni ke sanyas se khulkar khushi izhaar kar sakane vaali is jamaat main dinesh karthik, riddhimaan saaha, parthiv patel, ambati rayudu, siem gautam, udai kaul, punit bisht, naman ojha, aditya taare or robin uthppa jaise khilaadi agrani hai
 However, Ambati Rayudu and Robin Uthappa are part-time wicketkeepers and they continue to make a place in the team as a batsman
 lekin baaki wicketiper-ballebaaj ab team india main jagah banane ke bare main soch sakate hai
 In the absence of Dhoni in the last Test match of the current tour, Hriddhiman Saha will play the role of wicketkeeper
 kahana padegaa ki 2005 ke baad 9 saal guzar gaye, lekin in wicketiper ballebaajon ke liye isse behatar vakt pehle kabhi nahin aayaa hoga
 Many times people used to ask us about what players like Dinesh Karthik should do to join the team
 to jawaab miltaa tha ki ve kuch nahin kar sakate, kyonki unhen wicketiper dhoni ko nahin balki captain dhoni ko riples karnaa he or yah lagbhag naammumkin he
 But now the good days have come for all of them
 9 saal main pehali baar team india main wicketiper kii jagah khaali hui he
 Now the stage is open and these players also have a golden opportunity to make their place in Team India
 dhoni kii jagah lene ko taiyaar desh main maujuud kuch wicketiper-ballebaajon ke first class record par daalen ek najar

 Prof
 Gehlot faction in the party believes that due to these leaders, the party got strengthened and Congress's numbers in the state assembly have increased
 jisaki vajah se sarkaar main sthirataa ai or isiilie in vidhayakon ko mantri pad milanaa chahie
 In a special conversation with Aaj Tak, the mlas who joined the Congress from the BSP said that it is in the hands of the Chief Minister, the state in-charge not to give the post
 unka kahana he ki congress main kaam karne ke liye or apane kshetron ke vikaas ke liye party main shaamil hue hai
 But it is clear that factionalism in the Congress has again intensified with mlas from BSP
 basapa chhodkar congress main aae vidhayak vaazib ali ne kaha ki nikaay chunaav saamne hai
 In such a situation, we have to face these elections by strengthening the organization
 aane vaale vakt main jo kshetra ke vikaas ke kaary hai, vah aam janata tak kaise pahunche in sab baton par vichaar hua
 Just like we have joined the party together, in the coming times, all together will support the strong Congress

 The pilot faction believes that if the Gehlot government's cabinet expands, the leaders who have been working in the Congress should be given due consideration
 aisa nahin hona chahie ki inako nazarandaaj kar baahar se aae vidhayakon ko mantri pad yaa phir anya bodies main pad dekar party ke puraane kaaryakartaaon ko naaraaz karen
 Priority to old activists, Sachin Pilot, who is the Deputy Chief Minister of the state as well as the President of the state Congress Committee of the party, has already clearly stated that those who have joined the party, without any reward, the Congress party We have come, if there is any expansion, then old Congress workers and leaders should get priority in it
 yah vidhayak nikaay chunaavon se pehle congress ke sheersh netaaon dwaara kii ja rahi baithkon main bhi shaamil ho rahe hai
 At the same time, they are also talking about working for the organization
 kaha ja rahaa he ki party kii ore se in netaaon se kaha gaya he ki nikaay chunaavon ke liye jamkar kaam karen, uske baad unke bare main vichaar kiya ja saktaa he
 Jogendra Singh Awana, who joined the Congress unconditionally, said, as far as the post of minister is concerned, the decision is that of the Chief Minister, the state in-charge and the Congress president
 ham congress party ko majbootee ke saath jitaane ke liye kaam karenge
 He said that we have come to the Congress without any condition
 bataa den ki is maheene hone vaale nikaay chunaavon ko pichley maheene hue vidhansabha upachunaavon ke baad rajasthan kii raajnneeti ke hisaab se mahatvapurn mana ja rahaa he
 It is believed that after the results of last month's assembly by-elections, the Congress hopes have increased significantly about the body elections
 gauratlab he ki congress pratyaashee ne mandava vidhansabha upachunaav main 30,000 se zyada voton se jeet hasil karke bijepi pratyaashee ko haraaya tha
 Whereas the Congress candidate lost by about 4500 votes to the National Democratic Party candidate in Khivansar by-election
 pradesh main 16 november ko nikaay chunaav hone hai, jinka nateeja 19 november ko aayega

 Bijnore MP Bharatendu Singh took on Bhupendra Chaudhary, the election in-charge and panchayati raj minister
 bhaaratendu singh ne kaha, "chunaav main kuch log aise bhi lagaae jane chahie, jinhen jeetne kaa anubhav ho
 Bhupendra Singh lost elections thrice, making him Minister of Panchayati Raj in the state government

 He said, "one of the reasons for bjp's defeat in the Kairana Lok Sabha by-election is public displeasure with the local representatives
 ''hardoi ke gopamau se vidhayak shyamprakash haar ke baad pradesh sarkaar or sanghathan par baras pade
 Recently, Shyam Prakash, who termed Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath as innocent, wrote on Facebook, "raj got by Modi's name, could not do public mind, union organization hatchet, Chief Minister too helpless

 The BJP leadership has initiated an inquiry into the role of provincial leaders in conducting elections in the Kairana Lok Sabha by-election
 lambey samay se bhaajapa ke ek prantiy netaa ko lekar party ke bheetar asantosh he
 In the Nurpur assembly by-election, many BJP leaders have been accused of fratricide

 "the war of supremacy among the BJP leaders at the local level of domination has also damaged the internal discipline of the party

 Referring to the demonstration, Philip said- the Congress party gave the ticket to the women who supported from the backstage of this protest

 Controversy remains over the Moga rally to be held today by the Punjab government
 moga ke killi chahal jahaan par is raily kaa aayojan kiya ja rahaa he, vahaan kareeb 100 acre gehun kii taiyaar fasal ko kaat ko diya gaya he
 However the farmers have been compensated by the local administration
 prashasan ne ₹40,000 prati acre ke hisaab se muaavja kisaanon ko diya he jabaki kisaan ₹50,000 prati acre kaa muaavja maang rahe the
 However, a big question is arising about this rally, why the standing crop prepared for a government program that could be held elsewhere, was harvested
 prashasan kii ore se kareeb 100 acre jameen par khadi fasal hataane ke evaj main bataur muaavja 40 lakh rupee sarkari fund se diya ja rahaa he
 The Congress' agenda is to win the 'mission 13' i

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been targeted through these posters
 punjab sarkaar ke cabinet mantri sukhjinder singh randhaava kaa kahana he ki yah kaarykram sarkari he or punjab sarkaar ko bhi haq banataa he ki wo desh ke pradhanmantri se sawaal kare ki unke raksha mantralay se rafel deal se judi filein aakhirkaar kaise chori ho gayi
 He said that compensation for taking 100 acres of land taken from farmers for the Moga rally has been given to the farmers and there is no dispute on this
 sukhjinder randhaava ne kaha ki agar bijepi kaa rashtriya adhyaksh centre sarkaar ke kaaryakramon ke manch se raajnneetik bhaashan de saktaa he to hamaari party kaa adhyaksh kyon nahin?raily kaa naam badlamoga main congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi kii is raily kii taiyaariyaan yudhstar par kii ja rahi hai
 In the rally, it is being claimed that thousands of Congress workers will reach from all over Punjab
 pehle is raily kaa naam 'jai jawan
 
 
 Jai Hindustan 'was set to be held, but in view of the way the Congress has besieged the BJP and the central government to do politics in the name of martyrs, the name of this rally was later changed to' Kisan Karja Maafi Rally ' Was
 lekin baad main phir is raily kaa naam badal diya gaya or ise 'badhata punjab

 Captain Sandeep Sandhu, political advisor to Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh said that some Congress leaders had suggested to name this rally earlier after the soldiers of the country, but now this rally was only held for loan waiver of farmers

 gharelu vimaanan company spicejet ne apane bede main ek bowing737 vimaan shaamil karne kii ravivaar ko ghoshnaa kii
 With this announcement of spicejet, the company has now achieved a special achievement
 darasal, spicejet ke bede main vimaanon kii sankhya 100 par pahunch gai he
 spicejet is the fourth Indian company to have 100 aircraft in its fleet
 isse pehle airindia, band padi jet airways or indigo ke bede main 100 se adhik vimaan rahe
 "who would have thought that spicejet, which was on the verge of shutdown in December 2014, will have 100 aircraft in its fleet in 2019," said Ajay Singh, chairman and managing director of spicejet
 ’’ spicejet kii ore se jari bayaan ke mutabik company sirf pichley maheene main hi 23 vimaan bede main jode hai

 Let us know that currently eight domestic airlines Air India, Indigo, spicejet, goair, Air India Express, Vistaar, Air Asia and Alliance have a combined 595 aircraft
 vahiin jet airways karj main hone kii vajah se asthaayee taur par band ho chuki he
 Indigo and Spidget are expected to be the biggest beneficiaries of the closure of Jet Airways
 darasal, jet airways ke adhiktar slot ab in donon companiyon ko de di gai he
 At the same time, customers are also giving priority to these two companies
 iske alaava selary sankat se jujh rahe jet airways ke payalat samet kai karmchaariyon ne spicejet yaa indigo jwine kar liya he

 The wheel of capex (capital expenditure) is spinning and corporate earnings may be restored during the next two quarters or even earlier

 That is, there may be further cuts in rates during the coming months
 haal hi main dilli main “arthvyavastha kii sthiti” par bahes karne ke liye jab india today ke arthshaastriyon ke board (bite) kii baithak hui, to vishay yah nahin tha ki bhartiya arthvyavastha kaa kayakalp ho rahaa he yaa nahin, balki charchaa is baat par hui ki uski gati or bahaali kaa str kya he
 Three out of four economists rated the current state of the economy on a scale of ten, while seven gave nine points
 ho saktaa he ki nau ank dene vaala iklauta shaks kuch zyada ashaavadi rahaa ho lekin saamaanya dharna yah he ki pichley kuch varshon ke dauraan gart main rahane ke baad bhartiya arthvyavastha ab joardaar vaapasi karne kii sthiti main aa chuki he
 More important than this is the perception about the economy that it has been transformed
 chaaron arthshaastri ghatnakramon or bhavishya kii sambhaavnaaon ko lekar sakaaratmak dikhe
 The Narendra Modi government, which came to power by giving the slogan of economic growth, has made the environment positive for the Indian business but nothing has shown so far in its income and capital expenditure cycle
 pichley saal isamen susti dikhi he
 In fact, this has been a major concern and is the reason why the stock index has weakened as corporate earnings stagnate and even fall, despite continuously rising over a period
 bite kii maane to isamen badlaav ho rahaa he
 Surjit Bhalla, managing director of Auxus Research and Investments, says, "all the recent data including infrastructure has been strong during the last three months & not the entire year, just the last three months
 mujhe lagata he ki aay ke aankade jab aaenge to aapako isaki jhalak dikhaai degi, shaayad pichhali timahi ke ant kii aay main hi (june 2015)
 However, more than i think, it is likely that the glimpse of this will be visible at the end of the current quarter
 ”bahaali kii raftaar itani tej hogi, ise lekar har koi sahamat nahin he
 Sajid Chenoy, chief economist of India at JP Morgan, says, "look at the actual sales of capital goods companies included in the BSE 100 which are at 10 or 11 per cent

 Against the falling inflation, you can see the growth of debt given to the infrastructure sector on a real scale
 aap enechaeai or elandti kii order book par najar daaliye
 Something is going on
 dilachasp yah he ki log karj vruddhi ko dekhte hai, phir bhi kehete hai ki kuch nahin ho rahaa
 In this capital spending cycle, debt was not a forward-looking indicator for me, but a backward indicator because it has not moved

 indira gandhi institute of deveopment research (ijiidiaar) main professor ashima goyal kahati hai, “main apane hisaab se to agali do timahiyon tak intjaar karuungi, lekin acchhee khabar yah he ki pichhali timahi se credit reating agenciyaan korporate apgrade ko badha rahi hai
 Another good news is government spending, especially in railways, which is a major catalyst for growth
 ”aarthik vruddhi kii raah main ek bada roda mudrasphiti or kathor maudrik niti banaae rakhane tathaa byaaj daren kam na karne kii rigerv bank kii jid rahi he
 Indian industry has been critical of these policies of the Reserve Bank and the government has also requested further cuts in interest rates to boost growth
 bite kaa maananaa tha ki chunki madrasphiti ab niyantran main he, lihaaja rigerv bank ke liye daron main or katautee karne kii gunjaaish maujuud he
 Even according to the current figures, there was an opinion in the RBI on cutting at least 50 basis points (half per cent)
 centre for policy research main senior phelo rajeev kumaar ke mutabik, “march, 2016 main mere khyaal se mudrasphiti 4
 Will be around 5 percent which will be very comfortable for us
 yahi vajah he ki main aaj byaaj daron main or katautee kii vakaalat kar rahaa hum, kyonki mujhe lagata he ki philhal mote taur par aarthik sthiti aisi he ki rigerv bank vruddhi ko badhaava dene or puunjigat kharch ko sudhaarney main mahatvapurn yogadan de saktaa he
 Most members of BITE believe that as of March 2016, inflation 4
 5 se 5
 5 percent will remain between and because of this the Reserve Bank will have the facility to cut rates, which should be started soon
 ashima goyal kahati hai, “yah bhale hi aankadon par aadhaarit ho lekin philhal to aadha fisadi kii katautee kii gunjaaish he hi
 “the environment is looking positive for the economy but the Modi government will have to work harder for it now
 monsoon samet china or greece main ho rahe ghatnakram bhale hi sataha par mukhya kaarak ke bataur dikh rahe hon, lekin bade hue sarkari kharch ko lekar bhi kuch chintaaen kaayam hai, bhale hi vittiya ghate par iskaa maamuli prabhaav hi kyon na padataa ho
 Money needs to be spent right now, especially on sectors like infrastructure, which are engines of growth
 aise kadamon main ek nirnaayak kadam banking kshetra ke sudhaar ho sakate hai jinke tahat saarvajanik kshetra ke bainkon main paisa lagaaya janaa he or unke kaamkaaj ke maanakon main sudhaar laayaa janaa he
 Says Rajiv, "yes, the economy is on the mend but recently i met some big businessmen and others who say that things are very slow at the ground level
 niryaat main giravat aa rahi he or yah ek aisi ahm cheez he jisaki ore aapako dhyaan dena hoga&aap ise vaishvik maang kii daleel par nahin chhod sakate or maine yah sabit bhi kiya he ki ham niryaat kii vaishvik pratispardhaa main pichhadate ja rahe hai
 Why is this happening? i think this is happening because investors are confused about the rules and regulations
 ”videshi sansthagat niveshkon par lagaae jane vaale minimum alternetive tex ko lekar hue haalia vivaad ne bhi niveshkon kaa jaayaka kharaab kiya he
 The government is working very slowly on ease of doing business, although there has been an increase in investment in areas like highways, irrigation and railways
 krishi ke liye ek rashtriya online bazaar gathit karne ke haalia faisle ko bhi ek ahm sudhaar ke taur par dekha ja rahaa he
 These expectations will have to be further polished
 chenoy kehete hai, “bhartiya arthvyavastha duniya kii arthvyavastha se koi kati hui swatantra cheez nahin he
 During those six years when our growth rate was 9 percent, the world was growing at four percent
 aaj sabase acchhee sthiti main bhi duniya kii arthvyavastha 2
 2 or 2
 3 fisadi kii dar se badhegi
 So in a period of decreased global demand, we have to tighten our expectations again, so the potential growth cannot be 9%
 ” yah yathartwaadee soch he
 They say that at the moment we have to fix our foundation so that in the near future we will have at least 6

 unhone sawaal kiya, ''kya main garib ghar main janma hum, isliye neech hum? kya main lower cast se aata hum, isliye neech hum? congress ke netaa mujhase nafrat kyon karte hai?'' modi ne kaha ki yah saboot he ki gujarat main garib parivaar main janm lene vaale ko kitni mushkilen jhelni padati hai
 Addressing an election rally in Nicole, Ahmedabad, the PM said, "congress leaders have never called me chaiwala, neecha, mad dog, Bhasmasura, Ravana, drain worm, snake-scorpion and what not
 ''unhone kaha, ''congress netaaon ne mere khilaaf aisi abhadra bhashaa kaa istemaal saarvajanik rup se kiya he
 Targeting the Congress, he said, "during the Lok Sabha elections, Congress leader Imran Masood had said that i will tear Modi into pieces
" usko congress ne loksabhaa chunaav main tikat bhi diya tha
 Congress leader Renka Choudhary called me a virus
 choudhary ne kaha ki main namonitis laata hum
 "modi said," Congress leader Jairam Ramesh compared me to Bhasmasur
 congress netaa benny prasad verma ne mujhe pagal kutta kaha
 Verma also said that we will not let this mad dog win the election
 iske alaava congress netaa gulam nabi aaazaad ne mujhe gangu taili kaha
 "he said," Congress general secretary Digvijay Singh called my government even the demon king and me even to Ravana
 upi congress ke pramukh pramod tiwari ne mujhe hitler, musolini or gaddaphi tak kaha
 The Congress abused me day and night, but i remained at peace
 isaki vajah yah he ki meri praathamikta kaam karnaa he
 At the same time, the Congress has been on the backfoot since the attacks of BJP and PM Modi
 congress upaadhyaksh ne apane netaaon se modi ke bhaashan par pratikriya nahin dene ko kaha he
 However, now it will be known on December 18 that how much BJP and PM Modi can redeem the abuses of Congress leaders in Gujarat elections
 maaloom ho ki gujarat main 9 disambar or 14 disambar ko matdaan hone hai
 After this, the results will come on 18 December

 You'd be surprised to know that there is one in America from where anyone can bring a diamond
 isse bhi zyada dilachasp baat yah he ki yahaan jis shaks ko hira mil jaae vah uskaa maalik ho jaataa he
 For this, he does not have to pay any tax to the government or anyone else

 Until the results come out on May 23, i am not going to trust the figures that exit polls have given us
 aisa nahin he ki main shadyantr vaali theory main yakeen karata hum ki chunaav main dhaandhlee hui he, yaa EVM ke saath chhedchhad kii gai he
 i do not believe these, because the reality is different from what i see
 main galat ho saktaa hum, yaa main yah dekhne se chook gaya ho saktaa hum ki kab bharat itnaa badal gaya, lekin mujhe yakeen karne ke liye vaastavik aankade chahie
 i believe that there has been some change in the country in the last five years
 yah pehle ke kisi bhi vakt se kahin zyaada 'hindu' ho gaya he
 The Hindus of old used to avoid telling their Hindu identity, but now it is not so
 yah, mujhe lagata he, pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa asal 'yogadan' he
 If LK Advani is to be credited that he has instilled in a section of Hindus that he is discriminated against despite being a large majority, Modi has molded the same sentiment with such pervasiveness that he won To achieve
 ab sirf muslim hi vot bank nahin rah gaye hai
 a large Hindu vote bank has been created, which has made the Muslim vote bank almost irrelevant
 hinduon ke ek varg main muslimon ke prati purvaagrah - mahatma gandhi ne varsh 1909 main apni pustak hind swaraj main iskaa zikr kiya tha - ab nai pahchaan bana chukaa he
 That bias has taken a real form
 jis tarah rajnatik islam hua karata tha, ab rajnatik hindu bhi hote hai
 But the big question is - has being a political Hindu become so big that it has lost its economic identity
 
 
 ? kya ab yah myne nahin rakhata, ki aapke bete or betiyon ko naukariyaan nahin mil rahi hai, or pichley kuch saalon main aapaki krayshakti behad kam ho gai he, or ab aap baahar jaakar car jaisi vasteen jab chaahe nahin kharid sakate hai
 
 
 The It no longer matters that savings are decreasing, and trade is running in deficit
 
 
 ? aaj kii sachai yah he ki bharat, duniya kii sabase tezi se badhati arthvyavastha hone ke baavjood, acchhee haalat main nahin he
 Every economic indicator is telling a frightening tale and economists are warning that India is slowly moving towards recession, and the days ahead will be full of hardships for the entire country
 main yah maanane ke liye taiyaar nahin hum ki nayaa rajnatik hindu apni aarthik pahchaan ke prati itnaa nirlypt he ki rozmarra kii takaliphen uske liye koi myne nahin rakhti
 Statistics show that unemployment has broken all records, it is at the highest level in the last 45 years and there is no possibility of it coming down
 CMIE ke tazaatreen aankade bataate hai ki april ke tisare saptaah main berojgaare 8
 Was at an all-time high of 4 percent
 sarkaar lagaataar is aankade ko jhutlaati rahi he
 In fact, the government has stopped publishing employment figures and the agencies associated with it have started questioning the veracity of these figures
 NSSO or CMIE ke aankadon kaa mazaaq udaaya ja rahaa he
 Industrial production is falling, manufacturing and service sectors are no longer profitable
 upbhog, visheshkar gramin upbhog, ghat gaya he, auto bikri bhi haalia maheenon main behad buree tarah giri he
 i have argued in my book Hindu Rashtra that 'the promise of heaven' is a very effective weapon to hypnotize the whole people
 ise hamane notebandi or uske turant baad khud ghatate dekha he
 The whole world was shocked when BJP achieved a landslide victory in Uttar Pradesh in 2017 despite demonetisation
 lekin uske baad, jis tarah GST ko lagu kiya gaya, logon kii takaliphen kai guna bad gayi, or vah samay tha, jab mahasoos kiya gaya ki modi kii lokapriyata ghat rahi he
 The results of Gujarat, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan also proved this
 lekin is baat par yakeen karnaa mushkil ho rahaa he ki disambar, 2018 se halaat itane badal gaye hai, or log apane sari takaliphen is tarah bhul gaye hai, ki unhone modi ko 2014 se bhi behatar janadesh dene kaa faisla kar liya - jabaki us samay vah maseehaa samajhe ja rahe the, divyder-in-chif nahin
 Modi is not the same person in 2019
 2014 main unhone vivadaspad muddon par baat hi nahin kii thi
 He made development an issue
 unhone naukariyon kaa vaada kiya tha, desh kaa punaruddhar karne kaa vaada kiya tha, unhone chand laakar dene kaa vaada kiya tha
 He promised that he would make India a 'vishwaguru'
 unhone sampradayik muddon par baat nahin kii thi
 hindu-muslim issues were not on his agenda
 unhone 'sabakaa saath - sabakaa vikaas' kii baat kii thi
 He has changed in 2019
 vah zorshor se alpsankhyakon or bahusnkhyakon kaa mudda uthaate hai, jab rahul gandhi vynad se ladane kaa faisla karte hai
 He openly speaks of Hindus who are being harassed in West Bengal for chanting the slogan 'jai Shri Ram', and advocating for Muslims in the state
 unhone chunaav ayog ke aadesh ke baavjood sena kii bahaduree kaa sahaara liya
 He boasted, how under his leadership, the army in response to the Pulwama terror attack, killed and killed terrorists on their soil
 varsh 2014 main, vipaksh banta hua tha
 The Congress was not acceptable due to serious allegations of corruption
 aise main modi ne khud ko tazaa hawa ke jhonke ke rup main pesh kiya tha
 In the year 2019, the opposition unity graph is quite high, although it could have been better
 is baar congress ko nahin, modi ko jawaab dene the ki unhone paanch saal pehle kiye vaade puure kiye yaa nahin
 And his scorecard did not seem hopeless
 kuch sarkari kalyanakari yojanaon kii marketing acchhee rahi he, lekin kya vah doosraa kaarykaal dilaane main sakasham thim
 i doubt it iske baavjood, eggzet pole yah kehane kii koshish kar rahe hai ki log na sirf unke kaarykaal se khush hai, balki unhen pehle se behatar janadesh dene ke icchhuk hai
 It is said that Modi always walks with his ears attached to the ground
 agar unhen is tarah ke parinaamon kaa zaraa bhi anumaan hota, jaise eggzet pole bataa rahe hai, to vah utane murajhaae, thake hue or rakshaatmak nazar nahin aate
 Modi likes to show himself full of confidence
 lekin us press conference main, jise unhone kabhi sambodhit nahin kiya, vah apane vaastavik rup main haragiz nahin the
 He looked extremely worried
 kya vah abhinay kar rahe the
 
 
 The i do not think so
 shadyantr vaali theory main yakeen nahin karne ke baavjood mujhe is par yakeen karnaa mushkil ho rahaa he ki ye aankade sachche ho sakate hai
 i do not want to believe that these exit polls reflect the real thinking and desire of the people
 so, antim nateezon kaa intazaar karte hai, vaastavik nateezon kaa
 Only then will we be able to say whether India has truly become what it should not be

 VIDEO: Lifestyle disease is responsible for 61% deaths in India samaajawaadee party (sapa) dwaara apane rashtriya adhyaksh mulaayam singh yadav ke yashgan ke liye taiyaar kiya gaya geet 'man se hai mulaayam or iraade loha hai' party kaaryakramon main lokapriyata bator rahaa he
 But for the 81-year-old Uday Pratap Singh, the teacher of Mulayam Singh Yadav, who wrote the song, the job was one of the most difficult challenges in life
 mulaayam singh par ab tak do darjan se adhik geet likh ja chuke uttar pradesh hindi santhaan ke adhyaksh udai pratap singh ne lakhanu sthit apane daftar main 'india today' se khaas baatcheet main mulaayam par likhe geeton se jude pahaluon ko ujagar kiya
 "two months ago, Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav heard me the tune of American singer Billy Joel's very popular song 'we Didn't Start the Fire' in 1989 and asked him to write the song," says Singh
 yah mere liye jivan kii sabase kathin chunauti thi, kyonki maine kabhi bhi angreji geet kii dhun par hindi gaanaa nahin likhaa tha
 According to Singh, English songs only have rhythm and not poetry
 aise main angreji dhun par kavita pirona behad kathin kaam tha
 Uday Pratap Singh, keeping pace with the old leaders 'name, says,' i advised Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav to hand over the work to popular lyricist Gopal Das Neeraj
 ve is kaam ko khubsuurati ke saath anjaam de sakate hai, lekin akhilesh nahin maane
 After a month's hard work, Uday Pratap Singh wrote 'man Se Hain Mulayam Aur Aadhe Loha Hai' to the English tune which is becoming very popular these days in party programs
 singh bataate hai ki maine geet kii shuruyaat main mulaayam se pehle ke samaajawaadee andolan se jude netaaon ke naam shaamil kar dhun ke saath talmail bithaaya or uske baad sapa sarkaar kii janakalyankari yojanaon kaa zikr kiya
 Uday Pratap Singh was a teacher of English in 1958 at Jain Inter College Karhal, Mainpuri
 yahaan inhone mulaayam singh yadav ko 12veen kaksha main angreji padhai thi
 After completing his studies, Mulayam also became Uday Pratap Singh's fellow teacher at Jain Inter College

 chaahe maane yaa na maane, bhaajapa pashchim bengal ke musalamaanon ko lubhaana chaahati he, jinaki sankhya rajya ke matadaataaon main tees fisadi he
 Knowing that the party was not getting enough votes from Hindu voters despite Kimmata Banerjee attacking the "politics of Muslim appeasement", the Bharatiya Janata Party has now decided to reach out to 'liberal' Muslims
 aagaamee 19 farvari ko party kii rajya ikai muslim samudaay ke liye ek rajyastareey sammelan kii mejabani karegi jiskaa sheershak he-'narendra modi or alpsankhyakon kaa vikaas'
 Invitations have been sent to Muslim intellectuals, doctors, lawyers and technocrats such as professionals and religious leaders along with others to participate in it
 vaktaaon main purv patrkaar or rajyasabha sadsy swapn dasgupta, pradesh bhaajapa pramukh dilip ghosh or trinmul congress ke vidrohi netaa mukul roy shaamil honge
 BJP General Secretary Debashree Roy Chaudhary says it is to 'inform and educate' Muslims about all the work that the Prime Minister has done to 'empower' them
 udhaahranswaroop ve ''teen talaak se sambandhit aitihaasik faisle kaa hawala detii hai, jo lakhon garib muslim mahilaon ke liye vardaan ke rup main aayaa he
 Neither the Congress nor any other government dared to do so, even though he was seen as a friend of Muslims
 ''choudhary kahati hai ki samay aa gaya he, jab musalamaanon ko yah pataa chalegaa ki modi kii aguai main bhaajapa sarkaar ne kya hasil kiya he
 She cites the withdrawal of an annual Haj subsidy of Rs 700 crore, which will now be applied to the education of Muslim girls
 ve kahati hai ki yah asli vikaas he, congress or trinmul congress kii tushtikaran vaali niti nahinru ''ham yah bhi bataaenge ki kaise modi ji ne uttar pradesh main saiyad mohsin raja ko uttar pradesh kaa alpsankhyak maamalon kaa mantri banaaya, jabaki party ne ek bhi muslim ko chunaav kaa tikat nahin diya tha
 Chaudhary says that the saffron conference will also focus on how bjp-ruled states have served Muslims better
 jaise gujarat, jahaan das fisadi sarkari karmchaaree muslim hai, jabaki trinmul congress ke shashan main bengal main sarkari kaarybal main musalamaanon kii bhagidaari mushkil se teen fisadi he
 Ghosh says that Muslims want the right to equality, not bailout, charity or appeasement
 1 farvari ko hue uluberia loksabhaa upachunaav ke nattejey spasht karte hai ki muslim matadaataaon kii upeksha kar bhaajapa ko trinmul congress ko haraane kii baat sochni bhi nahin chahie
 The seat is 40 per cent Muslim and the Trinamool Congress candidate won by 4,74,000 votes while the BJP came second

 The BJP is also considering this event of February 19 as important for the Panchayat elections to be held in may-june this year

 Sanjay Leela Bhansali's film Padmavat is flagging success all over the world
 is bich film ke do mail kairactor kii zubaani jang bhi dekhne ko mil rahi he
 First Shahid commented on Ranveer Singh with the role of Alauddin Khilji, now Ranveer has responded to Shahid
 siddarth hossain se khaas baatcheet main actor ne kaha, 'mujhe dukh he
 i wouldn't call it (my role) best and worst
 'unhone kaha, mujhe nahin pataa ki shahid apane role ko behatar kar sakate the yaa nahin
 Got to learn a lot from Shahid
 vah kamaal ke actor hai
 We finished shooting the film and saw nothing
 actor ne yah bhi kaha ki deepika padukon ke saath unki jodi sabase acchhee he
 Let me tell you that Shahid, who played Maharawal Ratan Singh in Padmavat, said, 'if i had got the role of Delhi Sultan Khilji in the film, i would have done it better than Ranveer Singh
 ranvir ne ek baar kaha tha ki vah 'kamine' main meraa role behatar nibhaate
 i can play Khilji differently in Padmavat
 apane kamine vaale coment par ranvir ne kaha, wo unka industry main pehla tha
 He was more aggressive then
 shahid vivaad ke alaava bhi actor ne film se jude kai muddon par baat kii
 He said, a person like Khilji was very passionate, demonic
 main bahut pareshaan karne vaali chizon ke saath kaam kar rahaa tha
 i had to understand his reality to get into the role
 in 5 vajahon se 300 karod ke paar hui padmavat, ek vajah 'rajput' bhidipika ko dhamkiyaan:ranvir ne kaha, main bahut jaldi chizon par riect karata hum or bolta hum
 But i was given strict instructions
 produsar or mekars ne mujhe kuch nahin kehane ko bolaa tha kyonki isse film ko nuksaan pahunch saktaa tha
 Bus Attack in Haryana: That incident was very condemnable
 lekin ant main aise logon kii haar hui or film kii jeet
 Padmavat Worldwide is doing a good collection
 critics bhi film ko saraah rahe hai
 i am very happy for Bhansali
 karani sena kaa bhansaali par hamalaa:vah bahut hi dukhad or pareshaan karne vaali ghatana thi
 When i saw Mr
 Bhansali slapped
 main or deepika bhansaali ke hameshaa saath hai
 He never renounced things
 maine us gusse ko apni parformens main daalane kii koshish kii or vah faisla acha rahaa
 The film will be remembered for years
 deepika number-1 heroin:deepika aaj bollywood kii number van heroin hai
 i do not know about my stardom
 bas khud ko actor ke taur par dekhtaa hum
 Right now my best is left
 main paison ke liye kaam nahin karata, bas achche role chahta hum
 Deepika's performance: She was brilliant in the film
 maine deepika se kaaphi kuch siikhaa he
 She is very effective without doing much
 unki ankhen bahut kuch kahati hai
 She does not rate me much as an actor
 deepika kaa fevorett role piku or chennai express he
 My first meeting with Deepika and her journey so far was beautiful
 shaadi:in sabhi chizon ke bare main bahut kuch sochataa hum
 i think of balancing my life
 philhal meraa jhukaav kaam kii taraf he
 i am Gully Boy, Simba and busy in 1983
 pataa nahin meri shaadi or sagaai kii khabaren kahaan se aati hai

 lekin mujhe kadi hidaayaten di gai thim
 The producers and makers told me not to say anything as it could harm the film

 For the first time in the last five years, after two deaths due to malaria in the same season, the Municipal Corporation is engaged in a fever survey in Chandra Vihar, Delhi
 blad sample liye ja rahe hai, lekin shahdara main july ke maheene main malaria se hui pehali maut ke baad yah ection vahaan nahin dikhaa tha
 After Praveen Sharma died of malaria on 4 August in Delhi's Chandra Vihar, the corporation is now conducting a survey there
 jaise hi kisi ko bukhaar kii jaankaree milti he, uskaa blad sample liya ja rahaa he
 It is being confirmed whether the patient has malaria
 purvi dilli nagar nigam ke assistant malaria inspector prem singh ne bataaya ki jab bhi malaria se kisi kii maut hoti he, ham bukhaar peedit kaa sample lekar clinics bhejte hai ki kahin unhen malaria to nahin
 Not only this, after news of death, fogging has started in the area and spray has also started
 sab register main entry ke saath or doctoron kii maujuudagi main
 But people appeared angry with the attitude of the corporation
 chandra vihaar main sabji kii dukaan karne vaali minaa bataati hai, maut ke baad yah silsilaa shuru hua he
 Otherwise where do these people come? udhar, 55 saal ke surendar yah kehete hue hans padate hai ki kabhi-kabhaar nigam ke log is ilaake main kaam karte dikh jaaen, to ham khud ko khushnaseeb samajhate hai
 Today we are lucky
 tippaniyan But in the area of 62-year-old Charan Singh, who died of malaria on July 13 in Shahdara's West Jyotinagar Enclave, the corporation did not conduct any survey of fever victims
 bas khanapuri ke liye ilaake main foging hui or sirf inke ghar main dawa kaa chhidkaav
 Perhaps it is also because of his displeasure in the media
 charan singh kaa betaa narendar bataata he ki yahaan ilaake main foging hui
 Sprayed in my house
 aasapados main kahin bhi malaria fever kaa na survey hua, na blad sample liye gaye
 There were no more deaths reported in Delhi in the last five years before two deaths from malaria within two months of this season
 to sawaal uthanaa lajimi he ki kahin malaria phir se rajdhani main paanv to nahin pasaar rahaa
 
 
 The dilli ke chandra vihaar main 4 agast ko praveen sharma kii malaria se hui maut ke baad ab nigam vahaan survey kara rahaa he
 As soon as one gets information about fever, his blood sample is being taken
 tasadeeq kii ja rahi he ki kahin marij ko malaria to nahin
 East Delhi Municipal Corporation Assistant Malaria Inspector Prem Singh said that whenever someone dies due to malaria, we take a sample of the fever victim and send it to the clinic whether they have malaria or not
 itnaa hi nahin, maut kii khabar ke baad ilaake main foging bhi shuru ho gai he or spray bhi hone laga he
 With entry in sub register and in presence of doctors
 lekin nigam ke ravaiye se log naaraaz dikhe
 Meena, who owns a vegetable shop in Chandra Vihar, says the chain started after death
 nahin to kahaan aate hai ye log
 On the other hand, 55-year-old Surender laughs saying that sometimes when the corporation people are seen working in this area, then we consider ourselves lucky
 aaj ham khushnaseeb hai
 The comments lekin shahdara ke west jyotinagar anchlev main 13 july ko malaria se dam todane vaale 62 saal ke charan singh ke ilaake main nigam ne bukhaar peediton kaa koi survey nahin karavaaya
 The bus fogged in the area for Khanapuri and only sprayed medicine in their house
 shaayad yah berukhi isliye bhi ki media main inaki khabar ai hi nahin
 Charan Singh's son Narendra tells that there was fogging in the area
 mere ghar main spray kiya gaya
 There was no survey of malaria fever anywhere in the neighborhood, nor blood samples were taken
 is sijan main do maheene ke bheetar malaria se do mauton ke pehle beete paanch saal main dilli main or koi maut report nahin hui
 So the question arises whether malaria is spreading again in the capital

 Following this idea, the Jammu and Kashmir Police is running a homecoming program for Kashmiri youth who have left the path of terrorism
 iske tahat aatankwaad ke jabade se chhootakar aae kashmiri yuvaaon ko sunahare bhavishya ke sapane dikhaae jate hai or un sapanom ko puraa karne kii raah dikhaai jaati he
 This is a story of a Kashmiri youth who had been misguided by Pakistani terrorists and turned to the path of terrorism, but now he has become the poster boy of Kashmiri youth returning to the mainstream of terrorism
 aatankwaad kii raah par 'u-turn' lene vaala kashmir kaa betapako shaayad yaad hoga ki pichley saal hijbul commander sabajaar bhatta ke janaaje ke vakt bheed main najar aane vaale aatanki danish bhatta ne handwara police ke saamne sarender kar diya tha

 Later news of Danish being admitted to Hizbul Mujahideen broke his family

 He curses the day he decided to become a terrorist
 biessi kaa chaatr tha danishdanish ahamed jab hijbul mujahidin kaa aatanki bana tab wo dehradun ke doon piji kalege of agriculture science and technology main biessi kaa chaatr tha
 After this, in July 2017, Danish surrendered before the police and 21 Rashtriya Rifles in Handwara
 sarender ke baad danish ne mana tha ki use uttari kashmir main yuvaaon ko aatanki banane kii jimmedaari di gai thi
 Danish says that after spending some time with the militants in southern Kashmir, he realized the mistake of joining terrorism
 haal hi main anti teror oparations ke liye galentry aword se navaaje gaye sabir khan ko ye jimmedaari saunpi gai he ki wo aatankwaad kii raah chhodane vaale danish ko dobaaraa mukhyadhara kii jindagi jeene laayak bana saken

 danish akelaa kashmiri yuva nahin he jisane pehle aatankwaad se prabhavit hokar bandook uthaai phir bandook chhodkar dobaaraa apane kitabon ko thamkar misaal pesh kiya
 Danish is now also an inspiration for those Kashmiri youth who have become enemies of their own and others' lives trapped in the swamp of terrorism

 vahiin, saal 2017 main ye aankada doguna ho gaya
 According to security agencies, at least 130 local youth joined militant organizations in Kashmir last year

 The battle between bjp's Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore and Congress's Krishna Poonia on the Jaipur Rural Parliamentary seat has become interesting
 donon khilaadi rahe hai or krishna punia rathore par joardaar hamale kar rahi hai
 So even Rathore is not retreating
 lekin wo punia ko nahin congress ko nishaanaa bana rahe hai
 He is targeting the Congress manifesto
 jaipur gramin se bijepi ke ummidavaar rajyavardhan singh rathore ne kaha he ki congress rajya ko kamjor karne ke liye chunaav maidan main ai he
 People will not vote for that party, which talks of upholding Article 370
 kashmir main sena ko hataane kii baat karti he or rajyon main jari sena ke special protection force act ko khatm karne kii baat karti he
 Rathore says that we will go among the people and tell what kind of situation will arise in the country if the Congress comes
 rathore kaa aarope he ki yahaan tak usamen yah bhi kaha gaya he ki media ke upar bhi kanoon banaaya jayega
 If the Congress comes to power, then the media will not have the freedom to speak
 rajyavardhan rathore chunaav prachaar main lage hue hai
 While the Congress has fielded Krishna Poonia in front of them, instead of being in the election field in the name of Rathore Modi, caste is also engaged in caste equations
 jaipur gramin main rajput banaam jat kaa muqabla hota dekh rathore congress ke vot bank anusuchit jati, janajati or gurjaron ko alag se meeting kar samajhane main lage hai ki bijepi unki asli hitaishi party he
 Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore tried to convince the people of both castes to come to their temples and convince the BJP not to remain with the Congress
 haalanki congress ummidavaar krishna punia ke bare main baar-baar poochne par bhi rajyavardhan rathore kuch bolne ke liye taiyaar nahin hote hai
 Actually, Rathore's strategy is that he will not name Krishna Poonia in the entire election campaign
 yahi congress kii takat bhi he kyonki krishna punia ek antarrashtriya khilaadi hai, lihaaja rathore ke mukaable khadi ho sakati hai
 If he is new in politics, there is no charge against him

 The agenda of the meeting was very serious
 kamare main kareeb darjan bhar logon ne jo vikalp sujhaaye, unase bharat or pakistan ke bich paanchvaan yuddh chhid saktaa tha
 The meeting was going on just a week after the incident in which 10 Pakistani terrorists targeted Mumbai and killed 165 innocent people
 us hamale ke baad puraa desh gusse main tha or tatkaaleen pradhanmantri manmohan singh par badale kii karrwai karne ke liye janata kaa jabardast dabaav ban gaya tha
 In almost all the options put forward by the army and intelligence department chiefs, only one thing was being said — tasting of lashkar-e-taiba (let), the same organization that had planned the Mumbai attack
 sujhaaye gaye vikalpon main vishesh balon ke mishan, gupt hamale, vaayu sena kii ore se aatankwaadiyon ko training dene vaale campon par hamale ke alaava pakistan ke saath simit daayre main yuddh chhedia tak shaamil tha
 The US was also aware of the options for retaliation

 Cold Start Not Accepted Indian investigators have found Pakistan's involvement in the Mumbai serial bomb blasts in March 1993 and the local train blasts in July 2006
 in donon hamalon main kahin zyada kramash: 257 or 187 log maare gaye the
 But the 26 / 11 attack was of a different type
 pakistani aatankiyon kii ore se kiya gaya yah pehla hamalaa tha jisamen sochi-samajhi krurta ke saath aam nagarikon or videshiyon ko nishaanaa banaaya gaya tha
 The first meeting of India's security establishment was held at the PMO on November 28, just 48 hours after the attack began and by that time Indian commandos were close to wiping out the last four terrorists hiding in the heritage wing of the Taj Hotel

 Army Chief General Deepak Kapoor was out of the country as he was on a tour of South Africa at the time
 unki jagah sena ke upaadhyaksh leftinent general milan naidu baithak main shirkat kar rahe the
 The Prime Minister asked the heads of the Guptas Department for their opinion to deal with Pakistan
 us baithak main maujuud adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki us samay tak sena kaa vikalp ab bhi vichaarneey tha
 One option was cold start, in which the Indian Army planned to carry out a quick attack on the international border without waiting for full preparations
 disambar 2001 main jab sansad par hamalaa hua tha to pakistani seemaa par sena ko puri taiyaari karne main ek maheene se zyada kaa samay lag gaya tha
 By then, the opportunity to carry out punitive attacks had passed
 sena ne usase sabak sikh liya tha or cold start viksit kiya tha, jiske tahat kuch din nahin, balki kuch hi ghanton ke bheetar apatkaaleen sainik karrwai kii ja sakati he
 But Lieutenant General Naidu said he would like to wait for the Chief of Army Staff to return from a tour of South Africa on 28 November
 udhar nausena ke paas bhi teji se badale kii karrwai kaa koi vikalp nahin tha
 Navy Chief Admiral Surish Mehta said that his army was not yet ready to attack and had no strategy like 'cold start'
 guptchar agenciyaan is baat par nausena se khafa thim ki usne us chetavanee par koi dhyaan nahin diya, jisamen bharat main ghusane kaa intjaar kar rahi lashkar-e-taiyaba kii nauka ke lokation kii thik-thik jaankaree di gai thi
 In 2013, revelations by former intelligence contractor Edward Snowden revealed that the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) had caught hold of the Lashkar's ferry and the lashkar-e-taiba headquarters in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (pok), and on November 18, Raw Was informed about it
 yah mumbai par aatankwaadiyon ke hamale se aath din pehle kii baat he
 Air Chief Marshal Fali Homi Major was in favor of quick action
 unhone kaha ki vaayu sena 16 ghanton ke bheetar hawaii hamalaa karne ke liye taiyaar he
 But to make the attack a success and protect civilians from loss, they must have accurate knowledge of the locations of terrorist training camps
 lekin khufia agenciyon ke paas is tarah kii sateek jaankaree nahin thi
 Hence the military option was deferred
 hamale ke vikalpbharat ke suraksha pratishthan kii duusari baithak, jo 2 disambar ko hui thi, pakistan ke khilaaf sainik karrwai ke vikalp par zyada kendrit thi
 By that time, the Manmohan Singh government had clearly rejected the option of preparing for war or cold start like Operation Parakram
 ab sirf eliti ke khilaaf dandatmak hamale ke vikalpon par hi vichaar kiya janaa tha
 Exactly one week after the attack, Indian intelligence agencies had prepared a complete picture of the involvement of Lashkar in the Mumbai attack
 is pukchataa jaankaree ke peeche hamale main pakade gaye aatankwaadi ajmal kasaab kii ore se diya gaya ikbaalia bayaan, karachi ke control room main baithe eliti ke aadmi or mumbai hamalaavaron ke bich pakadi gai kai ghanton kii baatcheet thi
 The armed forces, especially the army and navy, were still not ready for options to attack let targets
 general kapur kaa kahana tha ki pakistan bhi hamale kaa jawaab de saktaa he, jiske baad bharat ko bhi jaise ko taisa vaala jawaab dena hoga
 Suggestions of army options came from an unexpected side — M
 ke
 Narayanan, who elaborated on five options
 haal ke dinon main shaayad yah pehali baar tha jab bharat sarkaar ke saamne kai tarah ke sainik vikalp rakhe gaye the or sabhi main puure paimaane par yuddh se bachane kii baat kahi gai ho
 These options ranged from surgical air strikes to covert operations and raids by security forces
 pehla vikalp pakistan main eliti netritv ke khilaaf gupt karrwai kaa tha
 Three other options suggested airstrikes on let's training camps and its headquarters in pok
 bhartiya vaayu sena ke ladaaku jet eliti ke thikaanon par sargical (sateek) hamale karte yaa helicopter se vishesh balon ke commando campon par hamalaa karte taaki aam nagarikon ko kisi tarah kaa nuksaan na hone paae
 The last option was to start a limited war, in which air strikes were limited to pok only so that the fighting would not spread across the Pakistani border
 yah spasht nahin he ki kya in vikalpon ko bhartiya sena se salaah-mashvire ke baad taiyaar kiya gaya tha, lekin teenon sena pramukh charchaa main shaamil the or unhone sabhi vikalpon par gahan vichaar kiya tha
 Every military option was closely introduced and the possible reaction from Pakistan to India's actions was also taken into consideration
 narayanan kii ore se rakhe gaye sabhi paanch vikalpon main karrwai ko pioke tak hi simit rakhaa gaya tha
 India has been claiming its claim on this part
 pehle vikalp, jisamen eliti netritv par badla lene vaala hamalaa karnaa tha, par gahan vichaar kiya gaya, lekin baad main use khaarij kar diya gaya
 It turned out that India did not have the capability of covert action
 uske paas pakistan main apane aadmi nahin the
 Former Prime Minister I
 ke
 Gujral ceased covert operations within Pakistan in 1997 and subsequent Prime Ministers rejected requests from their intelligence chiefs to resume RAW operations within Pakistan
 Went
 agar apane commando ko ghuspaith ke jariye bhejkar karrwai kii jaati to kasaab kii tarah unke pakade jane kaa khatra ho saktaa tha
 The officials involved in the meeting feared that doing so would put India in the category of Pakistan
 bhartiya khufia agenciyon ke adhikari sena ko eliti ke netaaon or training campon ke thikaanon kii sahi jaankaree dene main samarth nahin the
 They did not have men conducting secret operations in Pakistan that could destroy the bases
 or na hi ve kam samay main jaruri khufia jaankaree uplabdh kara sakate the
 Eventually the airstrike option was abandoned
 aakhri vikalp simit yuddh kaa tha, jise sirf pioke tak hi simit rakhana tha
 Under this, the army would gather with full preparations on the international border so that Pakistan could not take the war out of pok
 bhartiya sena kii karrwai ko jatil banane vaala ek kaaran yah bhi tha ki pakistan main teen hawaii addon or unke airspes main america sena maujuud thi
 The Indian Air Force would also have to rescue American fighter jets, bombers, drones and transport aircraft going into Pakistan and Afghanistan via the Arabian Sea in its attack
 sainya pramukhon ne vichaar kiya ki agar yuddh chhidata he to pakistan apni simit sainya kshamta or bharat kii jeet kii sambhaavna ko dekhte hue parmaanu kshamta kaa istemaal kar saktaa he
 If the war had started, it is not necessary that Pakistan would have kept itself under limited war
 vah parmaanu hathiyaaron ke istemaal kii dhamkee de saktaa tha jisase antarrashtriya birdari ko turant dakhal dena padataa
 According to one official, if India had to stop the war due to international pressure, it would not be good for India
 is tarah aakhri vikalp ko bhi khaarij kar diya gaya
 It was found that the Indian military machine, which had become hollow due to years of neglect, could not produce decisive results from the perspective of conventional warfare
 disambar 1986 main oparation brastax or disambar 2001 main oparation parakram ke vipareet disambar 2008 main pakistan kii seemaa par yuddh ke liye sashastr balon kii tainaati nahin hui thi
 But once again it became clear that terrorist organizations like lashkar-e-taiba have the ability to ply two neighbors with nuclear capability in a war against each other

 " Prime Minister Narendra Modi, while giving his views on the Father of the Nation Mahatma Gandhi here at the United Nations, said that Gandhi was an Indian, but he was not only from India and this platform is a living example of this
 pradhanmantri modi ne yahaan bharat dwaara yojit ek kaarykram main mahatma gandhi par apane vichaar saajha kiye
 World leaders, including Modi, also inaugurated the Gandhi Solar Park at the United Nations Headquarters here and on Gandhi's 150th birth anniversary, the United Nations also issued a stamp in his memory
 pradhanmantri karyaalay ne twit karke bataaya ki ‘samakaleen yug main mahatma gandhi kii praasangikta' vishay par bolte hue modi ne kaha, ‘‘ gandhi ji bhartiya the, lekin sirf bharat ke nahin the
 Today, this stage is a living example of this
 ''modi ne kaha, ‘‘ aap kalpana kar sakate hai ki jinase gandhi ji kabhi mili nahin, ve bhi unke jivan se kitna prabhavit rahe
 Be it Martin Luther King Jr or Nelson Mandela, the basis of his ideas was Mahatma Gandhi, Gandhiji's thinking
 ''pradhanmantri ne kaha, ‘‘aaj loktantr kii paribhaasha kaa ek simit arth rah gaya he ki janata apni pasand kii sarkaar chune or sarkaar janata kii apeksha ke anusaar kaam kare, lekin mahatma gandhi ne loktantr kii asli shakti par bal diya
 He showed the direction in which people should not depend on governance and become self-reliant
 ''unhone kaha, ‘‘mahatma gandhi ne ek aisi saamaajik vyavastha kaa bidaa uthaaya, jo sarkaar par nirbhar na ho
 It is well known that Mahatma Gandhi brought change, but it is also fair to say that he awakened the inner strength of the people and awakened them to bring about change
 ''unhone kaha, ‘‘agar aazaadee ke sangharsh kii jimmedaari gandhi ji par na hoti, to bhi vah swaraj or swaavlamban ke mul tatv ko lekar aage badhate
 This thinking of Gandhiji is becoming a great medium to solve big challenges facing India today
 '' Prime Minister Modi said, "in the last five years we have given priority to public participation
 chaahe svachh bharat abhiyaan ho yaa digital india ho, janata ab in abhiyaanon kaa netritv khud kar rahi he
 Modi said that Gandhi never tried to make an impact with his life but his life became the reason for inspiration
 unhone kaha, ‘‘aaj ham ‘kaise prabhavit kiya jaae' ke daur main ji rahe hai lekin gandhi ji kii soch thi- ‘kaise prerit kiya jaae'
 "modi said," Whether it is climate change, terrorism, corruption or selfish social life, these principles of Gandhi ji act as a guide to protect humanity
 mujhe vishwaas he ki gandhi ji kaa dikhaaya yah rasta behatar vishwa ke nirmaan main prerak siddh hoga
 "prime Minister Modi said," i understand that as long as this flow of ideas of Gandhiji with humanity continues, Gandhiji's inspiration and relevance will also remain among us

 puure desh main sawan ke maheene ko ek tyohaar kii tarah manaaya jaataa he or is parampara ko log sadiyon se nibhaate chale aa rahe hai
 Sawan is the best month to worship Lord Shiva, but do you know why the month of Sawan is so important and why Lord Shiva loves this month? Let's know about the beliefs behind this
 
 
 sawan maas kaa mahatv
 
 
 The Shravan month falls on the fifth place in the Hindi calendar and the rains begin in this season
 shiv jo ko shravan kaa devtaa kaha jaataa hai unhen is maah main bhinn-bhinn tareekon se puja jaataa hai
 Purnamah is a religious festival and is worshiped especially on Sawan Mondays
 bharat desh main puure utsaah ke saath sawan mahotsav manaaya jaataa hai
 Why does Lord Shiva love the month of Sawan? It is said that Sawan is the most beloved month of Lord Shiva
 iske peeche kii manyata yah hai ki daksh putree mata sati ne apane jivan ko tyaag kar kai varshon tak shraapit jivan jiyaa
 He was then born as Parvati, the home of the Himalayas
 parvati nebhagwan shiv ko patirup main paane ke liye puure sawan maheene main kathortap kiya jisase prasann hokar bhagwaan shiv ne unki manokamana puri kii
 Lord Shiva is very fond of this month of Shravan due to reconciliation with his India
 yahi kaaran he ki is maheene kumari kanya achche var ke liye shiv ji se prarthana karti hai
 It is believed that during the month of Sawan, Lord Shiva wandered in his in-laws shape on the earth where he was welcomed by consecration and hence the significance of Abhishek is told in this month
 puranic kathaon ke anusaardharmik manyatanusaar sawan maas main hi samudr manthan hua tha jisame nikle halaahal vish kobhagwan shiv ne grahankiya jis kaaran unhen nilkanth kaa naam mila or is prakaar unhone se sristi ko is vish se bachaaya
 After this, all the gods had poured water on them, that is why water has a special place in Shiva Abhishek
 varsha ritu ke choumasa main bhagwaan vishnu yoganidra main chale jate hai or is vakt puri sristi bhagwaan shiv ke adheen ho jaati hai
 Therefore, to appease Lord Shiva in Chaumasa, mankind undertakes many religious works, donations, fasting

 The Congress often alleges that the mainstream media does not listen to it
 sansad se lekar press conference tak congress har maukey par aarope lagaati he ki usko rashtriya channelon par paryaapt samay nahin miltaa
 Congress has now come up with a new strategy to overcome this difficulty
 congress ab soshal media ke madhyam se un jagahon tak pahonchegi jahaan mukhyadhara kii media congress kii awaz nahin pahunchaati

 sutron ke mutabik sangh ke sheersh netaaon ne yogi ko 2019 chunaav ke liye pradesh main free hand dene kaa faisla kiya he
 This means that Yogis will be able to take decisions of the government according to the needs of the elections
 yahi nahin sanghathan main bhi koi bhi bada faisla unki sahmati ke bina nahin liya jayega
 Who should be included in the government and who has to be shown the way out, these yogis will also be able to decide themselves according to the electoral needs
 ab tak aise faislon main pradesh sanghathan or kendriya netritv kii sahmati jaruri maani jaati thi
 In the last 24 hours, several rounds of talks took place between the BJP and the Sangh, as well as Yogi and the Sangh's big leaders
 iske baad rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ne yogi adityanath ko hi 2019 main uttar pradesh se bijepi kii jeet sunishchit karne kaa jimmaa saunp diya
 Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and his government will have the entire responsibility of working for the different castes including the Dalits and Backwards of the state
 sutron ke mutabik aresas ne yogi adityanath ko pichhadon or daliton ko puri tareeke se saath rakhane kaa hukum sunaaya he
 Along with this, it has been said to give an edge to Hindutva for which Kumbh will be used in full
 agar ye kaha jaae ki bijepi upi main 2019 kaa sangram jeetne ke liye kumbh ko sabase bada hathiyaar banaaegi to galat nahin hoga
 Let me tell you that till now there are reports of different poles of party organization and government in Uttar Pradesh
 isse yogi adityanath kii sthiti kamjor ho rahi he
 Indications are that Yogi Adityanath neither runs in the organization nor in the government as a whole
 rahi sahi kasar upachunaavon main bijepi kii durgati ne puri kar di he
 The Chief Minister has raised this issue several times in front of the top leaders of the BJP and the Sangh
 aise main sangh ne samanvay baithak main sabase bada faisla yogi ko free hand dene kaa kiya he
 There were several rounds of dialogue between the UP government and the Sangh on Tuesday
 mukhyamantri yogi adityanath subah dilli main sangh karyaalay jhandevalaan pahunche, jahaan par do ghante se zyada samay tak unki sangh ke sheersh padaadhikariyon ke saath baatcheet chali
 In Jhandewalan, Yogi first met Bhaiyaji Joshi
 iske baad unki mulaakaat mohan bhagwat se bhi karai gai
 According to sources, after returning from Delhi, Yogi Adityanath held a coordination meeting with the Sangh's Sah Sarkaryavah Dattatreya Hosabole at the Panchajanya office in Jiamau, Lucknow
 is baithak main dattatreya or siem yogi ke saath upmukhyamantri keshav prasad maury, dinesh sharma ke saath bijepi ke pradesh adhyaksh mahendra nath pandeya or upi ke sanghathan mahaamantri sunil bansal bhi maujuud the
 According to BJP sources, in this meeting, through the Kumbh, a plan was prepared to give an edge to the Hindutva agenda
 sangh ke sabhi anushangik sanghathan kumbh ke aayojan main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaayenge
 In the coordination meeting, the Sangh advised the Yogi government to emphasize the schemes of backward, Dalits and farmers
 sangh ne yogi adityanath se kaaryakartaaon kii naaraazgi khatm karne or kuch mantriyon kii aa rahi shikayaton par bhi gaur karne ko kaha
 Preparations have been made to trim some ministers
 khaskar un mantriyon ke jinke chalate sarkaar kii chhavi kharaab ho rahi he
 The Himachal Pradesh police team reached the monastery of Karamapa in Dharamshala to sort out the question of where the six and a half crore rupees came from in the monastery of Tibetan religious leader Karmapa
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki ravivaar dopaher ko poochtacha ke dauraan karmapa ke die jawaab se police santusht nahin he
 The police can question him once again
 police ke paas pachchis sawaalon kii fehrist he
 According to sources, this action is being taken on the guidelines of the Union Home Ministry
 sawaalon main paise kahaan se aae, kaise aae or karmapa kii sampattiyon kaa byoraa kya he, jaise masale shaamil hai
 On the other hand, the Dalai Lama has also said that the money recovered from the monastery of Karmapa is likely to have been donated from devotees from India and abroad
 buddha math main chini paiso kaa milanaa kya in mathon main chini paith sabit karti he? kya 17wein karmapa kaa bhi china se koi naata he? ye sawaal jaanch agenciyon ko pareshaan kar rahi hai
 Trying to find out what is the Chinese connection of Karmapa
 17wein karmapa ke dharmashala ke math main 24 deshon ke note mili hai
 Among them, only Chinese notes were the highest
 sawaal yah he ki kya ye note karmapa ke math ko china se jodate hai
 Questions have also arisen as to whether Karamapa himself was in contact with the Chinese authorities
 kya ye baramadagi karmapa kaa chini conection jaahir karte hai?is vakt jaanch agenciyaan inhen sawaalon ke jawaab dhund rahi he
 In the opinion of experts, China has been trying to set a spying trap in India
 sutron ke mutabik jaanchakartaaon ko shaq he ki karmapa ke math se mili note ladakh se tawang tak ke buddha mathon par beijing kaa varchasv kaayam karne kii chini sajeesh kaa hissaa ho sakate hai
 Sources associated with the investigation suggest that Karmapa was helping Chinese authorities establish Chinese domination over Buddhist monasteries in India
 ho saktaa he ki iske peeche tibeti dharmaguru dalai lamas ko kamjor karnaa bhi makasad ho
 Experts are of the opinion that China has been trying to spread its spying trap in India
 karmapa ke math se chini noton kaa milanaa is ore bhi ishaar kar rahi hai
 Intelligence agencies also suspected Karmapa Ugyen Thrinley Dorji's guru as an agent of China
 karmapa ke guru tai seetu rimpochhe ko buddha math banane main chini nivesh or china ke saath sambandhon ke chalate unhen bharat chhodie kaa aadesh bhi diya gaya tha
 If sources are to be believed, the intelligence agencies were aware of the money reaching the monastery, they were constantly monitoring the situation
 lekin ye paise kab or kaise pahunch rahe hai, isaki pukhta jaankaree nahin thi
 According to the evidence available so far, these money have been sent to the monastery only through hawala
 karmapa ke math se mili paison kaa chini conection agar jaanch agenciyon ne dhund liya, to jaahir he bhartiya seemaa main chini dakhal kii koshishon kaa ye bada saboot banengi
 Bihar Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi on Wednesday accused the Center of ignoring the interests of Bihar and warned that he would not allow seven ministers from this state, who are in the Narendra Modi government, to enter Bihar
 vishwa shauchalay diwas par aaj yojit ek kaarykram main maanjhi ne centre par bihar ke hiton kii andekhi karne kaa aarope lagaate hue narendra modi sarkaar main shaamil pradesh ke saat mantriyon ko chetavanee di he ki is rajya ke liye apeksha ke anusaar madad nahin mili to ve (maanjhi) unhen bihar main pravesh nahin karne denge
 In the Narendra Modi government, Radha Mohan Singh, Ravi Shankar Prasad and Ram Vilas Paswan are cabinet ministers from Bihar and Rajiv Pratap Rudy is Minister of State (independent Charge), Upendra Kushwaha, Ramkripal Yadav and Giriraj Singh
 maanjhi ne is avasar par apane bhaashan main in saaton mantriyon ko 'satbhaiya' (saat bhai) ke rup main ingit karte hue unase bihar ke hit kii raksha karne kii apil kii tathaa kaha ki agar ve isamen vifal rahe to unhen is pradesh main pravesh karne nahin diya jayega
 Manjhi, who comes from Mahadalit community, laughingly said, 'we have stumbled since childhood
 
 Stumbling becomes the Chief Minister, do not become Prime Minister in this offense
 ' Manjhi has accused the Center of ignoring Bihar on several occasions in the past over the reduction of about Rs 6000 crore in Indira Awas Yojana, MNREGA and other schemes
 ve pradhanmantri narendra modi par loksabhaa chunaav ke samay bihar ko vishesh rajya kaa darja or vishesh aarthik package dene ke apane vaade se mukar jane kaa aarope bhi laga chuke hai
 Another producer in Bollywood is going to knock the kid
 prabhudeva kii 'ramaiya vastavaiya' jald hi relies ho rahi he or is film ke saath produsar kumaar torani ke suputr girish kumaar bollywood main aagaaj kar rahe hai

 The film is releasing on 19 July

 The people of India made a daring leap of imagination with the midnight carrot ringing on August 15, 1947, seventy years ago
 unhone na keval apane aupniveshik aakaaon se aazaadee hasil kii balki us aazaadee ko sabase himmatvar mumkin tareeke se paravaan chadhaaya tha
 That flight of exultation and hope continues despite occasional visits to upheaval
 beete saat dashakon ke dauraan jab hamaare zyaadaatar padosi tamaam kism kii paradheenataon ke saath chhedchhad main mubtila the, hamaari swadhinata kii udaan bahaduree or pakke iraade kii chirsthayee gaatha main badal gai

 Defeated war is one such freedom which is already being tried in many countries
 yah he manabahlav ke liye padaarthon ke seven kii aazaadee
 In other words, "the right to drug"
 tamaam puraani sabhyataaon kii tarah andrik sukh ke prati hamaara doharaa ravaiya rahaa he
 The 20th century witnessed the intoxicating and intoxicating periods of both the decades of the 1960s and 1970s, when a global youth culture dominated by the power of mass education, travel and commerce became a force on its own
 unheen dinon tamaam kism ke manabahalaoo nashon ke istemaal main ijaphe se nipatane ke liye samaajon ne behat sakt kanoonee upaay kiye
 The 1980s was a period of implementation
 zyada saaf kahen to nashe ke durupyog ke khilaaf jang kaa jamaana
 America led the war against drugs and it invested the most money in it
 virodhabhasi baat yah ki aaazadkhyalon kii sarajameen ke taur par isaki jai-jayakaar kii jaati thi or teen dashak se pashchimi duniya ke gusse or aakrosh ke nishane par rahaa tha
 Elsewhere societies were bound by their responsibilities under the 1961 UN Convention on Narcotics and subsequent international treaties, and in the 1970s they began to prepare their legislative and enforcement machinery
 1980 ke dashak kaa madhya aate-aate manabahalaoo nashile padaarthon ke utpaadan, vitaran or seven ke khilaaf antarrashtriya vyavastha mote taur par kaayam ho chuki thi
 There was a complex mobilization against these laws and agencies in which there were millions of consumers who were ready to risk the lives of criminals by putting this law on hold, besides the cartel of producers and distributors
 keval isliye ki ve maanate the ki aisa karnaa aazaadee kii jindagi basar karnaa hoga
 You must be assuming that the outcome of this war was already decided
 har saal ham mahaan safalataa kii kahaniyaan sunate hai jinamein sarkari agenciyaan tanon marijuana yaa quintalon cocaine pakadati hai or jansankalp kaa shandaar pradarshan karte hue unhen aag ke hawaale kar detii hai
 However, this does not seem to make any difference to the street price of these substances, which varies from day to day and less than what is announced, nor the levels of consumption and consumption
 yah vaaki ajeeb jang he jisamen ham ladaaiyaan jitate jate hai to bhi jang ke nattejey par andeh bana rahata he
 Gradually, as in the case of the sexual revolution, public opinion is changing in the West about the freedom of drugs
 isaki kuch vajah to nashile padaarthon ke khilaaf jang se paidaa hui tabaahi he or kuch vajah khud aazaadee ke bare main badal rahi avadharana he
 In 2011, the wheel turned completely backwards when the Global Commission on Drug Policy, with its membership of two dozen prominent personalities like former UN secretary-general Kofi Annan, former US Secretary of State George Schulz and former US Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Walker, lent its long -the Chaudi report stated that "the global war against narcotics has failed and its people and societies around the world Disastrous consequences for the area are ''
 report ne is jang se paidaa tabaahi kaa vishleshan kiya or vikalp ke taur par is baat kii vakaalat kii ki nashile padaarthon ke istemaal ko un logon ke liye bade paimaane par gaiyr-aapraadhik bana diya jaae jo dusron ko koi shaareerik nuksaan nahin pahunchaate
 This stance was further elaborated in the Commission's 2017 report titled: "combating Prejudices Against People Who Use Drugs
" ''nashile padaarthon par niyantran ke kanoonon or un par amal kaa hindustani tajurba bhi duniya bhar ke tajurbe kii tarah kamyaabiyon or naakaamiyon kaa utana hi mila-jula tajurba rahaa he
 In 1985, we also enacted a very strong law, the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, which started from the first convention of 1961 in compliance with our obligations under various UN treaties
 andipies kanoon ke vajood ke teen se zyada dashakon ke dauraan kai halkon se isaki aalochana kii gai or ise police kii kathith badsuluki kaa udhaaharan bataaya gaya, jo isse kahin zyada kukhyat antkavaadi or vighatnkaaree gatividhiyaan (rokthaam) kanoon yaa tada se miltaa-julata tha
 As a police officer, i would say that the real problem is not in the implementation of this law by our enforcement agencies, but the problem lies in the basic philosophy which is at the root of this law
 aap jab ek sakht kanoon banaate hai, to uske durupyog kii ashanka to hoti hi he
 The battle against narcotics in India is even more disturbing given the rich and complex history of the use of narcotics in our traditional culture
 manoranjan ke duusare roopon masalan sangeet or kala kii tarah tamaam padaarthon kaa seven bhi dharmik prathaon main guntha hua he
 Just as South Americans consume hallucinatory ceremonies such as ayurveda and mescalin, hallucinations and charas are intimately associated with the Shaiva worship method of the Naga arena
 aap haridwar main lagane vaale kanvad meley main jaaen yaa chaar shaharon main lagane vaale kisi bhi ek kumbh meley main jaaen, to aap charas kaa jashn manata dekhenge
 It is not used here as a form of devotion to Shiva, but as an early drug leading to a more dangerous drug
 isi tarah opium kaa istemaal desh ke bade hisson main khaasaa aamayaham or samaaj main sweekrut he
 Criminalizing these practices and rituals has also not helped in curbing their consumption
 isane sirf itnaa kiya ki logon ko pareshaan karne kaa ek or aujaar police ke haathon thama diya
 Like sexual men, this is the area in which the government is losing this battle every day in the face of personal freedom and is paying a heavy price for the moral strength and personal freedom of the state
 yah vah jang he jo rajyasatta nahin jeet sakati
 The only solution is to retreat with discretion and dignity, to make it non-criminal and to implement rules based on medical research and evidence

 Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi has targeted the Chief Minister of the state, Vasundhara Raje, amidst allegations and counter-allegations running in the political corridors regarding the ordinance of Rajasthan Government
 rahul ne ravivaar ko twit kar likhaa ki 'madam chif ministar, ham 21veen sadi main rah rahe hai
 This is the year 2017, not 1817
 'darasal, vasundhara sarkaar ne aisa adhyadesh jari kiya he ki kisi bhi jaj, magistrate yaa locasevak ke khilaaf sarkaar se manjuuri liye bina kisi tarah kii jaanch nahin kii jaaegi
 Rahul Gandhi has targeted Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje with this ordinance
 is adhyadesh ke anusaar koi bhi locasevak apni duty ke dauraan liye gaye nirnay par jaanch ke daayre main nahin aa saktaa he, sivaay code of criminal prosijar 197 ke jisamen sarkaar ke str par sakasham adhikari ko 180 din andar prosicusan kii ijaajat deni hogi
 If the procedure is not allowed within 180 days, then the permission itself will be accepted
 rahul ke twit main 1817 hi kyon?rajasthan kii mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje kaa sindhiya gharaane se khun kaa rishta he
 Daulatrao Scindia ruled from 1794 to 1827 in Gwalior
 1816 main angrejon ne pindariyon ke daman ke liye sindhiya gharaane se sahyog karne ko maanga
 For some time, the Scindia Gharana remained in a state of turmoil at the invitation of the British, the following year in 1817, the Treaty of Gwalior was promised full cooperation
 media bhi nahin kar saktaa khulasasat sitambar 2017 ko jari adhyadesh main kaha gaya he ki kisi bhi jaj, magistrate yaa locasevak kaa naam or pahchaan bhi koi media tabatak jari nahin kar saktaa he, jab tak sarkaar ke sakasham adhikari isaki ijaajat nahin den
 This order, issued in the name of Criminal Law Rajasthan Amendment Ordinance 2017, has clearly placed a gag order on the media that it cannot disclose the identity of any officer until the competent authority at the government level allows it
 kise bachaane ke liye laayaa gaya adhyadesh?rajasthan main 23 oktober se vidhansabha satr shuru ho rahaa he
 In such a situation, many kinds of questions are being raised on the Vasundhara government for bringing such ordinances
 adhyadesh main likhaa gaya he ki chunki vidhansabha abhi astitv main nahin he
 Therefore, it is necessary to bring an ordinance
 itani jaldibaji main kise bachaane ke liye ye adhyadesh laayaa gaya he
 It is being discussed everywhere
 grahamantri gulabchand kataaria kaa kahana he ki eemaandaar adhikariyon ko bachaane ke liye ye adhyadesh laayaa gaya he
 Any honest officer is afraid to work that someone will intentionally falsely implicate him

 Corruption will be done under the guise of this and the media will not be able to do anything
 kya he vasundhara sarkaar ke adhyadesh main1
 The Rajasthan government has brought an ordinance to amend the Indian Penal Code, which will be passed as a bill in the assembly session starting on 23 October
 2
 According to this ordinance, no action against any public servant (government employee) judge or magistrate shall take place without the permission of the state government
 3

 kisi bhi locasevak ke khilaaf koi court nahi ja saktaa he or na hi jaj kisi locasevak ke khilaaf koi aadesh de saktaa he
 5
 koi bhi media kisi locasevak ke khilaaf bina sarkaar kii ijaajat ke aarope nahin laga saktaa he
 6
 kisi bhi locasevak kii shikaayat ke pehle sarkaar se ijaajat leni hogi
 Within 180 days, the competent officer at the government level will allow and if he is not allowed within 180 days, then his acceptance will be automatically accepted

 Violators of this law will also be entitled to punishment

 That is, half of the world will be closed due to the fix season of winter and summer
 aise main bahut mumkin he ki is jang ke baad aisi bhayanak sardi pade ki duniya se vegetesan yani ped-paudhon kaa naamo-nishaan hi mit jaae
 In such a situation, what will be the condition of humans can be realized
 maare jaaenge 2 karod se zyada logavaigyanikon kii maane to donon deshon ke bich atomi jang kii surat main 2 karod 10 lakh logon kii maut to pehle hi hafte main ho jaaegi
 This figure of deaths will be half of the number of people killed in the second world war
 itnaa hi nahin maut kaa ye aankada hindustan main pichley 9 saalon main aatankwaadi hamalon main maare gaye aam logon, police, jawan or suraksha balon kii kul taadaad se 2 hazaar 221 guna zyaada hogi
 It means to say that at the moment the terrorists are harming humans and humanity, nuclear war will kill 2 thousand times more humans than that
 haalat ye hogi ki duniya ke ek bade ilaake se ped-paudhon or vanaspatiyon kaa naamo-nishaan tak mit jayega
 Vegetation will also end
 or sirf isi vajah se lagbhag 2 arab log bhukh se maare jaaenge
 These figures were released in 2013 by the International Organization of Physical Scientists after a study to prevent nuclear war

 congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ko buudhvaar ko apane sansadeey kshetra amethi main us samay mushkilon kaa saamana karnaa padaa jab sthaneey logon ne unase poocha ki badhati mahangaai kab thamegi
 On a day-long visit to Amethi, Rahul landed at the Fursatganj airport in Rae Bareli on Wednesday afternoon and from there was going to Amethi's Jayas to join the self-help group women program by car when locals intercepted his convoy 
 logon kii bheed dekhakar rahul car se neeche utre
 During this time, people questioned him about the problems of school, electricity and roads, along with the rising inflation, on which he could not give any concrete assurance
 sthaneey nivasee bablu ne kaha ki hamane apane saansad se kaha ki kamartod mahangaai se jeena dubhar ho rahaa he
 Why is the Congress government unable to control the rising inflation
 hamane unase guhaar lagaai ki aap kuch kariye garib janata kaa jivan yaapan kar paanaa bahut mushkil ho rahaa he
 According to Bablu, on the plea of those people to control rising inflation, Rahul Gandhi assured that soon the Congress-led Central Government will take many important steps to control inflation

 har nai takanic aane par log use rojgaar ke liye khatra bataane lagate hai, lekin aisa hota nahin hai
 Every new technology is helpful in development and humans will always be needed to use the technology
 mumbai main yojit conklev main rishad ne kaha ki insaan takanic kaa istemaal karata aayaa he, takanic insaan kaa istemaal nahin kar sakati
 Rishad Premji said that technology has changed rapidly in the last 15 to 20 years
 bharat kii khaasiyat he ki log yahaan ke craft kii vajah se khinche chale aate hai
 Now every technology is changing
 har sector major profile changing ke daur se guzar rahaa he
 The trend of jobs is changing
 companiyaan apni kaaryastylee main badlaav kar rahi hai
 Companies are transforming themselves for customers
 yah digital transformation kaa yug he
 The society will always need teachers, the society will need, new opportunities of employment will be created in share marketing and other fields
 aise main naukariyaan ke maukey bhi hameshaa samay ke saath badhate rahenge, haalanki unamem badlaav ho saktaa he
 Nobody will go to job
 Premji said that technology is going to be phased over time
 isi tarah daawa kiya ja rahaa he ki jab swachaalit gadiyon kaa nirmaan kar liya jayega, lakhon kii sankhya main driveron kii naukariyaan chhin jaaengi
 This is very wrong
 kisi kii bhi naukari nahin jaaegi, ve log jo technology frandli honge, ve market main hameshaa praancegik bane rahenge
 People learning technology are always safe, India Today and Aaj Tak news director Rahul Kanwal questioned that the jobs of people are going on a large scale in the country
 nae aankadon ke mutabik agar jidipi main 10 fisadi growth ho tab jaakar 1 fisadi logon ko naukariyaan milengi, aise main naukariyon kaa sankat bana hua he
 How will it get over this? In response to this question, Rishad Premji said that always those who remain relevant in the market learn technology fast
 skill har industry kii maang he
 People should always be ready to learn new technology
 sarkaar alag-alag udyogon ke vikaas ke liye kaam kar rahi he
 Emphasis is being laid on people to take technical education
 sarkaar kii kai yojanaayen hai jinamein logon ko ek kshetra vishesh main trend kiya ja rahaa he
 The government should emphasize on technical education
 iske liye college or vishvavidhyalayon ko pahal kerani hogi
 Changes in the mode of employment, this claim was also rejected by Rishad Premji which said that in the coming days 5
 5 karod logon kii naukariyaan jaaengi, kyonki aise kai peshey maujuuda vakt ke hisaab se gaiyr jaruri ho jaaenge
 Premji said that people shift to new mediums
 chunautiyaan aati hai, log sikh lete hai
 Changes happening in India On the question of Startup India and Digital India, Rishad Premji said that there will be a good atmosphere of wealth creation in India
 ab kisi desh vishesh par hi nahin, vaishvik str par companiyaan focus kar rahi hai
 People's mindset is changing
 log asafalataaon ko sweekaar kar rahe hai
 People are not bothering when a startup fails, looking for new opportunities
 bharat ke iti sector kaa prodect devlepment kamjor he
 This is the reason that ticketlock is a hit, but India's own software has not become an internet sensation like this
 is sawaal ke jawaab main rishad premaji ne kaha ki bharat main doinmik change aa rahaa he
 People did not have the ability to take risks, people are still afraid
 log sikh rahe hai
 Changes are taking place at a rapid pace, so in the coming days we may see big changes in this sector too
 seemaa par lagaataar sijafire ke ulanghan ke bich pakistan ke pradhanmantri navaj sharif ne kaha he ki unka desh suraksha kaarnon se nunatam parmaanu santulan banaae rakhana chahta he, lekin uske hathiyaar kisi ke khilaaf nahin hai
 Radio Pakistan has reported that issues related to national security and defense were discussed in the meeting
 baithak kii adhyakshata navaj ne kii
 He said that Pakistan would continue to follow its policy of avoiding arms race in the region
 unhone kaha pakistan dakshin asia main shanti or samrik sthayitv chahta he or is lakshya ko hasil karne ke liye masalon ko baatcheet se hal karne kaa pakshdhar he
 -input IANS bhartiya janata party ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar narendra modi par virodhiyon ke hamale tej ho gaye hai
 While Congress leader Beni Prasad Verma called Modi an RSS goon, SP leader Azam Khan called him the elder brother of the dog's child
 uttar pradesh ke gonda main yojit ek jansabha main benny prasad verma ne bijepi ko jamkar aade haathon liya
 Beni said that the RSS and BJP are responsible for the death of Father of the Nation Mahatma Gandhi
 modi par waar karte hue benny ne kaha ki modi jahaan aresas kaa gunda hai vahiin bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh rajnath singh iske gulam hai
 Earlier Beni had said that RSS and BJP have been sold by Modi
 yaheen nahin benny ne yah bhi kaha tha ki bijepi main vahi ho rahaa he jo modi chaah rahe hai
 This party has begun to insult even its senior leaders
 udhar, rampur main samaajawaadee party ke senior netaa ajam khan ne bhi modi par hallaa bolaa
 In a public meeting held there, he said that Modi is the elder brother of the dog's child
 ajam khan ne modi ko gujarat dangon kaa doshi bataate hue kaha ki yadi yah aadmi satta main aa gaya to puure desh main gujarat jaisaa maahaul bana degaa
 Beni and Khan's attack on Modi has intensified ever since he was declared the candidate for the post of PM
 china ke mashhoor tite rope walker yani tani hui rassi par chalane vaale shaks aadilii vuksar ne sabase zyada vakt tak titarope walking karne kaa vishwa record kaayam kiya he
 Wuxer has registered his name in the Guinness Book of World Records by walking the Titrop for 198 consecutive hours at the Bird's Nest Stadium
 chini samachar agency ‘shinhua’ ne neshnal stadium ke pravaktaa shaay lee ke hawaale se kaha ki china main ‘titarope walking kaa yuvaraj’ kahe jane vaale vuksar ne kul 198 ghante or 23 minute tak tani hui rassi par chalane kaa karnama kar dikhaaya
 According to Lee, Wuxer started walking on a rope tightened from May 3 and continued doing so for 60 consecutive days
 pichley 60 dinon ke dauraan vuksar bards nest stadium kii chat par bane ek nau varg meter ke cabin main rahaa
 The rope hanging above the stadium was 60 meters in height and three centimeters in diameter

 Defense Minister Rajnath Singh did something that the opposition made fun of him in the chance to buy the RB001 Rafale aircraft from France
 lekin paksh ne vipaksh ke is majaak par tanj kar use taar-taar kar diya
 Muslim leader Asauddin Owaisi gave a precept to the Modi government in the Hadarbadi style, why not hang the lemon pepper on the border, all the slogans coming on the country will be averted
 darasal raksha mantri ne rafel ke pahiyon ke neeche do neembu rakhe, vimaan ke upar ek swaastik banaaya or uski puja kii
 Just as people of Hinduism do when they bring a car into the house
 alag-alag dhadon main bante log is par bhid gaye
 Right-wingers who cannot hear anything against Hinduism, leftists who see the defense minister's lemon-chilly faith as a scandal, see it as a policy of pressure on minorities by promoting religion
 rafel kharid ke bare main charchaa peeche ho gai log tut pade neembu mirchi ke paksh or vipaksh main tark dene ke liye
 Anyway, these days not only India but the big countries of the world have also divided into two people of polarization i
e
 ab dekhie log yah bhi kahenge ki aakhir log aisi moorkhtapurna charchaa main padate hi kyon hai? tool kyon di jaati he aise muddon ko ? aakhir isse fark hi kya padataa he? lekin sach baat to yah he ki is tarah kii ativaadee soch 'dhruvikaran' ke liye kargar shastr sabit hoti he
 It is important to understand how this polarization happens, so to understand this polarization process one has to understand the way of personal thinking, not the crowd
 manovaigyanikon ne bhi dhruvikaran ko samajhane ke liye kai adhyayan kiye
 Many theories were also prepared on this basis
 jaane siyaasi dhruvikaran kaa manovigya-1-vyaktigat approach thiriah is thiyari ke mutabik aise log jo apni parfarmens kaa aankalan nahin karte ve charampanthi soch vaale hote hai
 Not a liberal, but those who think on this side or the other side
 aise log apni galtiyon se bhi nahin sikhte
 Thinking in this way is called 'metacognitive skill'
 ab ye log yaa to dakshinpanth yaa phir vampanth vichaardhaara vaale honge
 Not a liberal at all
 aise log apni raay ke khilaaf bilkul bhi nahin sunate
 2-there is an approach, which is related to the surrounding environment
 jaise bharat main in dinon 'dakshinpanth' kaa ubhaar saaf dikh rahaa he
 So are all these new right wing people? It's not like this
 darasal desh kaa rajnatik vaataavaran pehle is soch ko saport nahin karata tha
 Even if i say secularism or secularism or pseudo secularism will not be wrong
 lekin jaise hi satta ne dakshinpanth ko hawa deni shuru kii, ve log saath ho liye jinke vichaar abhi tak hawa pani na milane se supt pade the
 The philosopher 'erik Hoffer' wrote an essay 'the True Believer'
 irik ne dekhnaa chaha ki aakhir communism yaa najivadi andolanon ke peeche kya prerana hoti he? kaise ek bada andolan khadaa ho jaataa he
 So they came to the conclusion that when people who are lying dormant get their thoughts, they join them
 or khadaa hota he ek andolan
 However, sometimes a leader is so influential that not only awakens the dormant but also changes your attitude
 3-iko chanmbar effectah sabase mahatvapurn iko chembar effect ko samajhnaa he
 In the era of social media (app, Facebook, Twitter and what not), every political party is able to spread its agenda
 baqayda aapaki soch se milte julate soshal media notification lagaataar aapke phone par aate rahete hai
 Actually, the kind of post that you have clicked in the past, such posts constantly fall in your social media
 aapaki soch kii baarik rekha in post ke jariye gahari khai main kab tabdeel ho jaati he, aapako bhi nahin pataa chalata
 This proves to be an amazing weapon during elections
 jaise agar e siyaasi party 55 pratishat vot paane main sakasham he to bi 45 pratishat
 Obviously the party with 55 percent of the vote will be the winner
 lekin 55 main saare e party ke kattar samarthak nahin honge
 If 10 percent of the people also came from this side, then the result would be reversed
 ab yah is baat par nirbhar karegaa kii kis party ne apane agenda ke prachaar ke liye kitne kaabil log rakhe hai
 That is why a political victory depends not on work but on the election strategy of its messengers

 It is understandable if the liquor mafia breaks the rules of the government rules
 lekin sarkaar hi apane banaaye niyamon ko taak main rakh de to peedit kaha fariyaad lagaae
 This is happening in Chhattisgarh
 yahaan ek april se rajya kii bijepi sarkaar khud sharaab bech rahi he
 But that too on the lines of the chaos of liquor contractors
 raipur main sharaab bechney ke liye jab sarkaar ko dukaan nahin mili to ek dawa duukaan ke ek hisse par hi sharaab kii dukaan khol di gayi
 People first saw the confluence of medicine and alcohol together
 lekin maamla yahi tak nahin he
 Right next to this liquor store is the primary school
 jabaki sarkaar ne hi niyam banaaya he ki dharmik sthalon or skulon se maykhaane kam se kam 100 meter dur honge
 This is the case of Shankar Nagar, a posh area of raipur, the capital of Chhattisgarh
 yahaan ke mukhya rod par kareeb 20 saal se chalaa aa rahaa yah skool he
 There used to be a drugstore right next to it
 lekin ab skool or dawa dukaan ke bich main yah sharaab kii dukaan khul gayi he
 The liquor shop is in full swing since April 1
 subah se lekar raat tak yahaan sharaab ke shaukeenon kaa jamaavada laga rahata he
 People have witnessed the unique confluence of medicine and liquor for the first time
 darasal is ilaake main logo ne sharaab kii dukaan kholane ke liye apane parisar or dukaan nahin diai to prashasan ne dawa dukaan ke hisse ko simata diya
 The ranks of medicines were split on one side and liquor shops were opened overnight
 yah sab kuch karte vakt prashasan ne is ore bilkul nahin dhyaan diya ki sharaab dukaan ke thik bagal main skool bhi he
 He is also about 20 years old
 sharaab dukaan ko lekar naa to dawa vikreta ko koi aapatti he or naa hi sharaab ke shaukeenon ko
 But the tragedy has broken over the students and teachers of this school
 unki aapatti ko darkinar kar diya gaya
 People of the area also opposed this liquor shop
 lekin unki aawaaj bhi nakkaar khaane main tuuti kii aawaaj kii tarah dab kar rah gayi
 For the time being, students leaving school and their parents are spending time in a hunger strike demanding the removal of liquor shop
 rajya ke aabkaari niyam ke mutabiq sharaab dukaan kholane ke liye kisi bhi surat main uske ird-gird dharmik sthal or skool nahin hone chahie
 The distance from these two places to the liquor shops and the precincts should be at least 100 meters apart
 lekin is niyam kii dhajjiyaan uda di gayi
 Officers from the administration and excise department and police inspected the site

 Rich businessman
 
 
 karodon kaa kaarobaar
 
 
 Kidnapping
 
 
 or 100 karod kii phiroti
 
 
 There is a kidnapping that happened on a small island in the western corner of the country
 
 
 lekin isaki sajeesh kaa taana-bana buna gaya desh ke 6 rajyon ko mila kar
 There was a happy atmosphere in a village in Chapra district, about 50 km from Patna
 log naach-ga rahe the, kyonki is ghar se baraat nikal rahi thi
 But behind this procession, there was a secret burial in a room of this house, which no one could think of
 kyonki ek taraf to is makaan main shaadi ho rahi thi, logon kii bheed ikatthi thi
 The feast was being flown
 vahiin duusari taraf isi makaan ke ek kamare main pichley bees dinon se qaid ek noujvaan apane rihaai kaa intazaar kar rahaa tha
 In other words, i was counting the clocks for our freedom
 lekin sawaal ye he ki ek bhare ghar main, jahaan shaadi kii vajah se jabardast chahal-pahal thi, saikadon logon kaa aana-janaa laga tha, vahaan bhala koi noujvaan kaise qaid ho saktaa tha? sawaal ye bhi he ki akhir is noujvaan kaa gunaah kya tha? or use yahaan is haal main kisne qaid kar rakhaa tha? in sawaalon ke jabaav main apharan kii wo ajeeb kahani chhipi he, jis par kisi ke liye bhi yakeen karnaa bhi mushkil ho saktaa he
 a kidnapping in which the son of a billionaire businessman was abducted by a few politicians and policemen
 25 dinon tak use qaid main rakhaa gaya or sau karod kii phiroti maangi gai
 Because it was the biggest kidnapping ever
 noujvaan bete ko kiya agavidhar daman kii ek factory par badmaashon ne dhaava bolaa or udhar surat ke ek parivaar main sannata pasar gaya
 Because the miscreants kidnapped the young son of this house
 lekin iske baad badmaashon ne is parivaar ke saamne jo maang rakhi, waisi maang ab tak naa to kisi ne rakhi thi or naa hi suni thi
 One could not think of what happened this day in Daman, one of the Union Territories of the country
 amir kaarobaari haneef hingora ke bete suhail hingora ko unheen kii factory se hathiyaarband gundon ke ek gang ne tab agava kar liya, jab wo rose kii tarah factory kaa kaam-kaaj sanbhaalane pahunchaa tha
 The incident left the Hingora family of Surat restless
 ye unke liye ek bada jhatka tha
 The younger Suhail was as quick-witted, as smart as he was
 wo karate kaa blike belt holder tha
 But he did not stand in front of the armed goons and in the next few minutes, the miscreants had taken him away from Daman by picking him up
 iske baad jab der tak suhail waapas nahin lautaa, to gharavaale police ke paas pahunche, lekin daman police bhi suhail ke bare main koi khaas suraag nahin laga saki
 In the meantime, two days passed and then what happened was the fear
 anjaan numberon se coffb kuch anjaan numberon se suhail ke pita haneef hingora ke mobile par phone aane laga
 The caller said, 'your son Suhail is in our possession
 agar, uski kairiyat chaahate ho, to sau karod rupye kaa intazaam kar lo
 Here, you gave money and your son will return there
 or haa, agar tumne koi chaalaaki karne kii koshish kii, to nateeja thik nahin hoga
 'as soon as i heard these things, there was silence in the Hingora family
 suhail ke pita haneef hingora ke pairon tale zamin khisak gai
 Now the families understood that their miscreants had been kidnapped by the miscreants
 or bete kii rihaai kaa bas ek hi rasta he, wo he aparankartaaon kii maang puri karnaa
 But thinking about the huge demand, the Hingora family was sweating
 har baar phiroti ke liye ek nae number se coffb hingora parivaar ko agle phone kaa intazaar tha
 On the other hand, the Daman Police was fully alert to find the address of the miscreants
 iske baad is parivaar ke paas ek-ek kar kai phone aae or har baar aparankartaaon ne suhail ke gharavaalon ko jald se jald rupye nahin dene par bete ko waapas nahin lautaane kii dhamkee di
 However, despite this conversation and all efforts, the police could not locate the kidnappers
 vajah ye ki jab-jab police ne hingora parivaar ko kol karanevaale numberon ko tres karne kii koshish kii, tab-tab wo number swissd of mili
 It was also surprising that a new number was being called for ransom every time
 daman se lekar odisha or uttar pradesh tak failaa hua tha gangazahir he, badmaashon ne suhail ko agava karne se pehle puri taiyaari kii thi
 On the other hand, the police had started surveillance of every number coming to Suhail's house
 
 
 lekin is baar bhi police ulajh kar rah gai
 During the investigation, he came to know that the numbers with which Suhail's family members are being telephoned are from Odisha and Uttar Pradesh
 
 
 yani un numberon ke sim card odisha or uttar pradesh se khride gaye the
 
 zaahir he apharan karanevaale badmaashon kaa gang koi maamuli nahin, balki ek aisa gang tha, jo daman se lekar odisha or uttar pradesh tak failaa hua tha
 And despite all efforts, the police were not getting any information about Suhail's real whereabouts
 isi bich ek lanbaa vaqt guzar gaya or tabhi ek aisi baat hui, jisane hingora parivaar ko chaunkaa diya
 
 
 Now his son's hopes of returning home were visible
 ab suhail ko agava hue takreeban ek maheene puure ho chuke the or is bich gharavaale lagaataar aparankartaaon se phiroti ko lekar baat kar rahe the
 Because the Hingora family was rich, but not so rich that they would have paid the ransom of 100 crores rupees so easily
 udhar, itane dinon se hingora parivaar se baatcheet karte-karte badmaashon ko bhi ahsaas ho chukaa tha ki unka shikaar unhen sau karod rupye nahin dilaa saktaa
 However, in the meantime, the family agreed to give the kidnappers a sum of between Rs 9 crore and Rs 25 crore, and the miscreants decided to release Suhail in exchange for this amount
 ab maheene bhar baad hingora parivaar kii khushi ab waapas laut rahi thi
 And the miscreants told the place for Suhail's release, he once again drove the Hingora family
 badmaashon ne kaha ki phiroti chukaane par suhail kii rihaai patna ke gandhi sethu ke paas hogi
 So was Suhail hidden somewhere in Bihar for so many days? The wishes of the family came very well, the time also came when the wishes of the family were fulfilled
 or 28 november ko suhail ko patna ke gandhi sethu ke paas uske gharavaalon ke hawaale kar diya gaya
 That is, in this game of ransom of crores, Suhail's life was saved
 ab bhi kai sawaal the, jinka jawaab kisi ke paas nahin tha
 For example, who had kidnapped Suhail after all? Where was it hidden in Bihar? Where did the people of this gang hide from Daman to Bihar? The questions were many, but all were unresolved
 dish conection ke idi number se fanse aparnakartrub suhail badmaashon ke changul se chhot kar apane ghar surat pahunch chukaa tha or police bhi usase aparankartaaon kaa pataa poochne uske ghar aa chuki thi
 However, at the time of the kidnapping, the miscreants had injected him with drugs and knocked him unconscious and were kept locked in a room for a month, even before his release was blindfolded
 lekin itnaa hone ke baavjood suhail ne akhirkaar pulisavaalon ko us ghar kaa pataa bataa hi diya, jahaan wo itane dinon tak qaid padaa rahaa
 In fact, Suhail had memorized the ID number of the dish connection of the television set in the incarcerated room and the ID number of the ten digit proved to be the biggest clue for the police
 bas, isi ek link ke sahare police chhapra chaturpur gaanv ke is makaan tak aa pahunchi
 And according to Suhail, the police also recovered his handkerchief and ID card hidden in this room as evidence from here
 police ne yahaan se ranjit naam ke ek noujvaan ko dhar dabocha, usee ranjit ko, jisaki suhail ke yahaan qaid rahane ke dauraan shaadi hui thi
 While a few days later Ranjith's father Nagmani Singh also got caught in the police trap, who was himself a Sub Inspector of Jharkhand Police
 lekin ab bhi is maamle main police ko ranjit ke do bhaaiyon deepak singh or sonu singh samet kai badmaashon kii talash he
 Who had spread this kidnapping of kidnapping of hundred crores in six states of the country

 The Bhupesh Baghel government has decided that till the full verification of the beneficiaries of MISA detainees, the amount of Samman Nidhi they receive will continue to be withheld
 farvari se yah roak lagu kii ja rahi he
 This system was started by the Raman Singh government of the Bharatiya Janata Party
 ab is par bain lagaate hue mukhyamantri bhupesh baghel ne kaha he ki misa bandi swatantra senaanee nahin hai, aise main unhen pension kyon di jaae
 Why the decision was taken The government says that this decision has been taken under Lok Nayak Jayaprakash Narayan Samman Nidhi, 2008, to make the process of funding for democracy fighters more transparent
 iske tahat sammaan nidhi kaa laabh paane waalon kaa baqayada bhautik satyaapan bhi karaayaa jayega
 It is being said that only after this process of verification, the amount of Samman Nidhi will be given to democracy fighters
 haalanki, sarkaar ke is faisle par loktantr senaanee sangh ne sawaal uthaae hai
 The national vice president of the union, Sachchidananda Upas, has said that the government's intention is not right
 unka kahana he ki satyaapan ke liye ise band karnaa jaruri nahin he kyonki band kiye bina bhi satyaapan shaskeey str par kiya ja saktaa he
 He said that there is no explanation as to when this pension will not be received

 Those who have been in jail for three months get 10 thousand, those who have been in jail for 3-6 months get 15 thousand and those who are in jail for more than 6 months get the Samman Nidhi amount of 25 thousand rupees

 vah sanvaidhanik padadhari kam or congress kaaryakarta kii tarah zyada pesh aa rahe hai
 Criticizing Bhardwaj due to the action taken on corruption charges leveled against Yeddyurappa, the BJP said that the Governor could not hold grudges due to political reasons and cannot consider himself in place of the Commission of Inquiry or Lokayukta
 gyaapan main bhaajapa ne mukhyamantri ke khilaaf diye gayi karnataka ke rajyapal ke kai saarvajanik bayanon kaa zikr kiya or kaha ki ‘saarvajanik rup se aise bayaan aamtaur par vipakshi netaaon dwaara diye jate hai

 Putting the blame of the current situation on the Congress, MP from Karnataka and senior BJP leader Venkaiah Naidu said that in the entire episode, the 'high commander' is the Congress high command and the Governor of Karnataka is seen as 'patradhar'
 nirdesh alaakaman se mil rahe hai or kadam uthaane kii bhoomika rajyapal adaa kar rahe hai
 Asked if meeting the President was the last option available to the party, he said it was necessary to outline the issue before Pratibha Patil

 He warned that if the Congress and the Center continue to support the Governor 'without exercising discretion', a chaotic situation may arise across the country
 naidu ne kaha, ‘agar rajyapal is tarah se shashan karnaa chahenge, janadesh ke khilaaf jaayenge or apana sanvaidhanik kartavya adaa nahin karenge to desh bhar main arajak sthiti utpann ho jaayegi

 In the wake of the upcoming Lok Sabha elections, the ruling Samajwadi Party (SP) in Uttar Pradesh has made up its mind to give Sukanya, the wife of Babu Singh Kushwaha, a former minister in the Mayawati government in Dasna Jail, the status of Minister of State in Bundelkhand
 
 babu singh kushvaha is samay rashtriya gramin swasthya mishan (enarechaem) main hue ghotaale ke aarope main gajiabad kii dasna jail main band hai
 Kushwaha, who specializes in playing the game of politics from 'jugaad', is being duly run from jail also
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki khud jail main rah kar apni patni sukanya or bhai shivasharan kushvaha ko pichley dinon sapa main shaamil kara diya or ab sukanya ko sapa sarkaar main rajya mantri kaa darja milane kii sambhaavna balavati ho chuki he
 Kushwaha Kunba has become active for the creation of 'lalbatti' by calling for the Lok Sabha elections
 sukanya ko lalabatti dekar sapa ek tir se do nishane saadh sakati he
 While the 'stigma' of not having a single minister from Bundelkhand will be washed away in the Akhilesh cabinet, this step can also be effective in mobilizing voters from the backward castes like Kachi, Kushwaha, Maurya and Murai communities
