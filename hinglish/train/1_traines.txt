lihaaza donon ne mil kar ek aisi sajeesh rachi jise puraa surat shahar kabhi nahin bhul paaegaa
 Read here: The desire to become rich created an air hostess in the gangster bedroom
 Dishit's corpse was such that people were expressing their sympathy with the murderer
 par sirf tab tak jab tak ki is sajeesh or planning kaa puraa sach saamne nahin aa gaya
 And this truth came out of six lies
 isse pehle ham aapako bataate he ki aakhir hua kya tha
 28 June 2016, Day Tuesday
 surat shahar kaa posh ilaaka parley point
 There was an atmosphere of mourning since morning in a stately home here
 vajah thi jane-maane kapadaa kaarobaari dishit zarivaala kaa qatl
 Dishit was killed in his house late at night
 us vakt ghar main sirf teen log maujuud the
 Dishit his wife Welsey and one and a half year old daughter
 ghar ke andar jis bedroom main katl hua vahaan sara saamaan bikharaa padaa tha
 At first glance, it seemed that the house was looted
 ye he velsi kii juthi kahaneus raat kii kahani bataane ke liye iklauti chashmadid velsi hi bachi thi
 He was in a bad state
 magar police ko to apni tafteesh kerani hi thi
 So the police interrogated Welsey in some way
 poochtacha main velsi ne bataaya ki 27 june kii raat wo teenon kisi rishtedaar ke ghar dinar par gaye the
 Returning home from there at around half past nine
 phir upree manzil par apane bedroom main aa gaye
 But forgot to turn off the light of the parking area below that guided daily
 lihaaja dishit parking aria kii lite of karne ke liye phir se neeche gaya
 But when, after a long time, Directed did not return to the bedroom, he made a sound
 dishit ne tab jawaab diya ki wo upar aa rahaa he
 But what he saw a short time later was very scary
 velsi ne bataaya ki teen nakaabposh lutere dishit ke gale par chaaku rakh kar use upar lekar aae or aate hi pehle unhone use or uski beti ko bathroom main band kar diya
 But before locking him in the bathroom, he also robbed his worn jewelry
 jab kaaphi der baad use laga ki lutere ghar se chale gaye hai, tab usne bathroom kaa sheesha todaa or phir shor machaaya
 Neighbors came to hear the noise
 jiske baad hi use pataa chalaa ki dishit kaa qatl ho chukaa he
 The police had no reason to suspect Welsey after the Wellesys statement that came under suspicion during the investigation
 magar jab police ne tafteesh aage badhaai to ek ajeeb baat pataa chali
 It was learned that Welsey's father-in-law had already gone abroad
 magar katl vaali raat velsi yaa dishit ke baaki saare rishtedaar bhi surat se baahar the
 Now the question was how did the robbers get this information? To find the answer to this question, the police again came to search the house of Dishit
 talaashi ke dauraan achaanak ek saath kai aisi chijen saamne ain jinhone velsi ko shaq ke katghare main laakar khadaa kar diya
 Must Read: The story of a murderer who throws a headless corpse out of prison
 Welsey's lie When the police investigate each of Welsey's statements, it is understood that there are six things that Welsey lies
 velsi ne kaha tha ki vaardaat ke vakt dishit neeche parking aria kii lite band karne gaya tha
 While searching the house, it was found that a switch on the parking area light is also in the bedroom on the upper floor
 velsi ne kaha tha ki lutere dishit ke gale par chaaku rakh kar jabardastee ghar main ghuse the
 And brought Dishit up at the tip of the knife
 jab unhe katl hi karnaa tha to dishit ko neeche bhi maar sakate the
 Welsey had said that the robbers looted valuables and even his jewelry from the house
 hatyaron kaa makasad agar lutpaat hi tha to jis dishit ko unhone maaraa uske haath kaa sone kaa kadaa anguthi, purse kyon chhod dipha? velsi ne kaha tha ki luteron ne dishit se hathapayee bhi kii
 Used to wear guided glasses
 magar uskaa chashma kahin gira nahin
 Welsey reported three robbers
 jabaki ghar ke sisitivi camere main sirf do hi log nazar aae
 Even the timing of the incident in CCTV camera and that of Welsey's time did not match
 karodon kii daulat ke liye kiya katlbas in chah jhooth baton ne police kii sari tafteesh palat di
 After this, it was decided to strictly interrogate Welsey
 or faisla rang laayaa
 If Welsey wanted to marry her lover, she could do so without killing Direct
 magar aisa karne main velsi kaa nuksaan tha
 Because then she had to wash her hands with crores of wealth from husband Dishit
 or use aashiq ke saath daulat bhi chahie thi
 iqbal-e-jurmwelsi of Welsey confessed to his crime and told the police that she was in love with a man named Suketu
 magar donon kii shaadi alag-alag jagah ho gai thi
 Despite this Suketu and Welsey continue to meet and decide to marry
 dishit se alag hone kii bajaae velsi ne use raste se hi hataane kaa plan banaaya kyonki isse velsi dishit ke karodon kii jaaydaad kii hakdaar ho jaati
 She chose to be murdered on the night of 27 June because all the close relatives, apart from her in-laws, were out of the city that day
 plan ke tahat suketu or uske driver kii entry ke liye velsi ne jaanboojh kar ghar kaa daravaaza khulaa chhod diya tha
 The two entered the house with a mask, raincoat, knife, chilli powder and other things and killed Daishit sleeping on the bed as soon as they entered
 jab donon dishit kaa qatl kar rahe the, velsi vahiin bedroom main khadi ho kar apane pati kaa qatl hote dekh rahi thi
 After this, in order to show the whole case of looting, it is Welsey who gave Suketu his jewels and scattered the whole house
 magar wo dishit kaa sone kaa kadaa, anguthi or purse nikaalnaa bhul gai
 Welsey and her boyfriend Suketu arrested
 Currently Welsey and her lover Suketu are in police custody
 vaise is vaardaat se sabase zyada agar kisi ko nuksaan hua he to wo velsi kii apni dedh saal kii bacchee he
 Whose father was killed by the mother and the mother will now be in jail
 yani is bacchee ke sir se ek saath maa or baap donon kaa saaya uth gaya he

 Pakistan, badly besieged after the Pulwama terror attack, has indicated to take decisive action against jaish-e-mohammad kingpin Masood Azhar
 ek senior suraksha adhikari ne iskaa khulaasa kiya he
 He said that Pakistan has created a mood to take action against all terrorist organizations
 isse pehle pakistan ke videsh mantri shah mahmud kuraishi ne daawa kiya tha ki bharat dwaara pulavama hamale kaa dogier saunpe jane ke baad aatanki sanghathan jaish-e-mohammad ke mukhya thikaanon ko pakistan sarkaar ne apane kabje main le liya he
 The Tribune newspaper quoted Pakistan's security officer as claiming that Pakistan had made up its mind to act against terror before the Pulwama terror attack
 haalanki abhi tak yah spasht nahin ho paaya he ki aakhir pakistan masood ajahar or anya aatankiyon ke khilaaf kis tarah kii karrwai karegaa
 It is being told that Pakistan may give up its insistence to save Masood Azhar as part of its action against terror
 vah sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad kii vaishvik aatanki kii suchi main masood ajahar ke shaamil kiye jane ke apane virodh ko waapas le saktaa he
 On the question of Pakistan saving Masood Azhar in the UN Security Council, the official said that the government of Pakistan had to decide whether a terrorist was more important or national interest for him
 pakistani adhikari ne yah bhi saaf kiya ki aatankwaadiyon ke khilaaf nirnaayak karrwai kaa faisla bharat ko phase seaving dene ke liye nahin liya gaya he
 He said that we need to improve ourselves for the benefit of our nation, due to which these actions are going to be taken against terrorism
 pakistani adhikari ne yah bhi daawa kiya ki pakistan ne pulavama aatanki hamale kii jaanch bhi kii he, lekin usamen pakistani aatankiyon ke haath hone kaa koi saboot nahin paaya he
 He claimed that the Pakistani leadership had decided that action would be taken against anyone involved in the Pulwama terror attack
 pakistan ke adhikari ne yah bhi kaha ki pulavama aatanki hamale kaa jo dogier bharat ne pakistan ko diya he, usamen kisi pakistani aatanki sanghathan ke sanlipt hone ke koi saboot nahin hai
 If seen, Pakistan has been lying on every issue
 antarrashtriya manch par alag-thalag padaa pakistan ab apni aatank kii chhavi ko badalane kii koshish kar rahaa he
 Let us tell you that on February 14, there was a suicide attack on a CRPF convoy in Pulwama, Jammu and Kashmir, in which 40 soldiers were killed
 iske baad bharat ne pakistan ke balakot main ghuskar karrwai kii thi or jaish-e-mohammad ke aatanki thikaanon ko tabah kar diya tha
 Masood Azhar's brother-in-law Yusuf Azhar was also killed
 bhartiya vayusena kii is karrwai se baukhalaaye pakistan ne bharat ke sainya thikaanon par hawaii hamalaa karne kii koshish kii thi, jisko vifal kar diya gaya tha
 The Pakistani Air Force F-16 was shot down by the Indian Air Force
 is hawaii bhidnt main bhartiya vayusena kaa ladaaku vimaan mig-21 bhi haadase kaa shikaar ho gaya tha or iske payalat wing commander abhinandan vardhman pakistan ke kabje vaale ilaake main chale gaye the
 However, after pressure from India, Pakistan left Abhinandan
 is dauraan pakistan ne bharat se saudebaaji karne kii bhi koshish kii thi, lekin bharat raji nahin hua tha
 India says that Pakistan should take action against the terrorists first, only after which any kind of talks will be held

 use nahin maaloom he ki uske shaheer par ye bam kisne lagaae hai

 While this may benefit the film, the Hollywood film Avengers Endgame may also have the disadvantage of being on screen beforehand

 If his film proves to be a box office hit, it will not only be a good start to his political career but will also be a comeback at the box office

 com / 8rug0wbhee punjab police ke teen dijipi rank ke afasaron ke bich chal rahe vivaad ko shant karne ke liye mukhyamantri captain amarinder singh ko bichbachaav ke liye utarana padaa
 He has instructed many top officials of the state police to remain under discipline
 buudhvaar kopunjabake mukhyamantri or grih mantralay ke incharge hone ke naate captain amarinder singh ne punjabpulisake tamaam aalaa adhikariyon jisamen dijipi or edijipi rank ke adhikari shaamil the, ko talab kiya or kade shabdon main sandesh main bataaya ki anushaasanheenata bardaasht nahin kii jaaegi
 The government will have no hesitation in removing officers who violate discipline
 meeting se thik pehle punjab ke siem kii taraf se puure vivaad kii jaanch karne ke liye banaai gai 3 sadsy cameti jisamen grih sachiv enes kalsi, mukhya pramukh sachiv suresh kumaar or dijipi suresh aroda shaamil hai
 Out of this committee, Punjab DGP Suresh Arora disassociated himself saying that the DGP rank officer who made the allegations has also accused him and as such, it is not right for him to remain in this inquiry committee
 sutron ke mutabik beete kuch dinon se police vibhaag main ucch adhikariyon ke bich chal rahi khinchataan se mukhyamantri behad khafa hai
 He warned all senior police officers in Wednesday's meeting that strict action will be taken against those who violate discipline
 maamla dabaane kaa aaropapunjab police ke dijipi (human risource deveopment) siddharth chattopadhyaay ne pichley shuukravaar ko punjab and haryana hoicourt main vishesh arji dekar aarope lagaaya ki jagadish bholaa drugs maamle kii jaanch ko dabaane ke liye punjab police ke dijipi suresh aroda or dijipi intelligence dinakar gupta, iji el ke yadav ke jariye unhen inderpreet chaddha aatmahatya maamle main fansaane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 Chattopadhyay has described himself as innocent in the suicide case of Inderpreet Chadha, son of Charanjit Singh Chaddha, former chairman of Chief Khalsa Dewan, and demanded a CBI probe into the case
 inderpreet chaddha ne pita charanjit singh chaddha kaa ashleel video saarvajanik hone ke baad aatmahatya kar lee thi
 DGP Chattopadhyay had also alleged that Punjab Police DGP Suresh Arora and DGP Intelligence Dinkar Gupta are trying to implicate them to save the officers involved in the drugs report they are preparing for their investigation
 punjab-haryana hoicourt main chattopadhyaay kii taraf se yachika lagane ke baad hoicourt ne is puure maamle kii report talab kii
 After this, the allegation of the Opposition created a ruckus in the Punjab Police and the politics of Punjab
 punjab aam aadmi party ke senior leader or vidhansabha main netaa vipaksh sukhpal khehara ne aarope lagaaya ki chattopadhyaay drugs maamalon main visal blor hai or punjab police ke bhrasht adhikariyon ke drugs sindicket se gathjod ko ujagar karne kii koshish kar rahe hai
 For this reason, they are being implicated in false cases
 sukhpal khehara ne aarope lagaaya ki punjab ke mukhyamantri captain amarinder singh ko bhi is puure maamle kii jaankaree he, lekin apane bhrasht afasaron ko bachaane ke liye wo bhi chattopadhyaay ko anushaasan main bane rahane kaa hawala dete hue fansaane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 On this whole matter, the Punjab government says that Captain Amarinder Singh's effort is that if there is a mutual tussle between the officers, then such cases should be reported to the Chief Minister through Proper Channel and Protocol and not directly to the High Court
 
 isi vajah se captain amarinder singh ne buudhvaar ko meeting bulaakar afasaron ko do took kaha he ki anushaasanheenata kisi bhi haal main bardaasht nahin kii jaaegi
 No one came in front
 All the DGP and ADGP rank officers of Punjab attended the meeting called by the Chief Minister on Wednesday, but no police officer was ready to speak or tell anything on this whole controversy
 tamaam senior adhikariyon ne gend grih mantralay ke mukhiya mukhyamantri captain amarinder singh ke paale main daal di or kaha ki meeting siem kii ore se bulaai gai he to mukhyamantri hi kisi bhi sawaal kaa jawaab denge
 DGP Siddharth Chattopadhyay said that the matter is in court and he does not want to comment on it
 duusari ore, punjab main drugs maamalon kii jaanch karne ke liye banaai gai estf ke chif harprit siddhu ne bhi is puure vivaad par kuch bhi bolne se inkaar kar diya
 After this, a ruckus arose in the politics of Heppanjab Police and Punjab
 lassi vaaki laajawab thi
 With a layer of thick cream
 'aah vaah' kar hi rahaa tha ki nazar us tasviir par pad gai, jis par likhaa tha - commered surajpal verma ji
 You will find such a good lassi at Etawah Chowk and that too at a comrade's shop, was not thought
 bharat ek kissa-pradhan desh he
 No one knows when i get an anecdote
 surajpal verma itawa ke puraane communist netaa rahe hai
 As soon as his son Hiralal Patel left, he said that Prakash Karat comes to our house, Brinda Karat comes
 sipiem ke kai saansadon kaa bhi naam lene lage
 Hiralal ji started making lassi for us and started explaining the condition of Marxist Communist Party in Etawah
 kaha ki abhi bhi party kaa hi kaam karte hai
 Whom do you vote for? Now they do the work of the communist, but vote for the SP
 kya karen, hamaari party kaa vajood kamazor he
 So never felt like leaving the party? No, we cannot leave ideology
 subah kii shuruyaat ek behtareen lassi se ho jaae to kya baat
 After that he went to Yasinagar village in Etawah itself
 yah gaanv shakya samaaj kaa mana jaataa he
 Meaning, a large number of people of Shakya community live here, considering Buddha, Chandragupta and Ashoka as the heroes of their glorious history
 shakya, kushvaha, maury or saini obisi main yadavon ke baad duusare number kii prabhaavshaalee jatiyaan hai
 Some communist activists also met in this village
 ek noujvaan ne kaha ki vah apni jati kii pahchaan ko ubhaarna chahta he, magar uski jati main jaagrukta aane main vakt lagegaa
 When the matter progressed, the young man said that he goes to the sit-in protest of the Communists, but will vote for BJP, because the CPI-M cannot win here
 ham apana vot kyon barbaad karen
 Vote and wave cannot be understood so easily
 vot dene kii praathamiktaayen har matadaata kii alag hoti hai
 At the moment, we are giddy by drinking comrade's lassi

 After Baba's claim, people started asking questions as to why Kohli had not accepted this in an interview so far

 i have always seen Sachin Tendulkar and i was aware of the partnership between him and Sourav Ganguly around 250 runs
 main or dipti jab pehle wicket kii saajhedaari ke liye 300 ran puure karne ke paas pahunche the, to mujhe itnaa pataa tha ki hamane england kii sara tailor or carolin atkins ke 268 ranon kii saajhedaari kaa record tod diya he

 a new trend has started in elections
 nota kaa
 That is, of the nuns of the abav (none of the above)
 electranink voting mashin yani iviem main sabase neeche nota kaa ek alag batan lagaaya gaya he
 Voters who do not want to vote for any candidate, can press these buttons
 is vot kaa chunaav parinaamon par koi asar nahin hota
 That is, even if NOTA gets the most votes in an election, not the NOTA, but the second-ranked candidate will be declared victorious
 ummidavaaron kii jamaanat jabt hone ke formule main bhi inaki ginati nahin hoti he
 So the question is, why would a voter come out of his house in scorching sun after voting in an hour-long line at the polling station and vote for NOTA? But many people are doing so
 haal ke vidhansabha chunaav main pehali baar nota batan kaa istemaal kiya gaya
 Of the eleven and a half crore voters in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Delhi, 15 lakh pressed the NOTA button
 yani sirf sava fisadi votaron ne
 This is not a very large number
 lekin mana ja rahaa he ki dilli main congress se naaraaz kai votaron ne nota kaa batan dabaa kar use nuksaan pahunchaaya
 Similarly, a large number of people in Maoist affected areas of Chhattisgarh expressed their distrust towards political parties by pressing the NOTA button
 nota kaa batan dabaane vaale zyaadaatar log wo hai jinka maujuuda raajnneetik vyavastha se vishwaas uth chukaa he
 Be it Congress or BJP or any other major regional political party, these people do not want to support them
 chhattisgarh main maovadiyon ke asar vaale ilaakon main badi sankhya main nota ko dale vot ye dikhaate hai
 If the Aam Aadmi Party had not been in the fray in Delhi, then probably NOTA would have got more votes
 yani congress or bijepi se naaraaz aise log jo nota kaa batan dabaanaa chaahate the, unhone iske bajaae jhaadu ko vot dena behatar samajha
 So, is the Aam Aadmi Party emerging as a medium through which people can vent their anger? There are many people in the society who say 'all are thieves'
 vyavastha ke prati gussa rakhane vaale log is baat se nahin hichkichaate ki unhen ghar se chalakar matdaan kendron main ja kar bhi ek aise batan ko dabaanaa he jisase kuch nahin hone vaala
 Negative voting cannot give the right direction to the country or society
 nota isi kaa sanket he
 For many, voting for NOTA has been the same as voting for the Aam Aadmi Party
 jisase kuch badalane vaala nahin, magar vyavastha ke prati apane gusse kaa zarur izhaar kiya ja saktaa he

 'arunabh ke ghar par teen mahilaon ke saath meri ek meeting thi
 Meeting was going on in the hall of the apartment
 tabhi arunabh meeting bich main chhodkar uth gaya or andar kii taraf chalaa gaya
 After some time, when he did not come, i went inside giving voice
 achaanak, maine mahasoos kiya ki kisi ne peeche aakar mere donon vakshasthal dabaa die
 When i looked back, it was Arunabha
 main hairaan thi
 He was looking into my eyes with his eyes
 main kamare se bhaagi
 The meeting ended immediately and returned
 iske baad TVF kabhi waapas nahin lauti
 Yes, this is the sensational story of a woman who accused the CEO and founder of youtube channel 'the Viral Fever' (TVF) Arunabh Kumar for molesting her
 peedita ne aarope lagaaya ki dhai saal ke kaarykaal ke dauraan uske saath kai baar chhedchhad kii gai
 However, TVF denied the allegations, alleging that the allegations leveled against him were false in all respects
 ye TVF or uski team ko badnaam karne ke liye likhaa gaya he
 At the same time, many more women in this case have shared their views accusing Arunabh of molestation
 peedita ne apane blog main likhaa he
 
 
 About 6 in the evening that day
 45 baje arunabh ne achaanak mujhe kol karke offis bulaayaa
 He said that some part of my work has not been completed
 main turant offis pahunchi
 Three people were present there
 unamem se do paanch minute ke andar chale gaye
 Arunabh was sitting comfortably in his chair
 usne meri taraf dekha or poocha- chatrbhuj sthaan kaa naam suni ho? main chakit thi
 Chaturbhuj is the red light area of muzaffarpur in Bihar
 maine is sawaal par koi respance nahin diya
 He further asked - i like Chaturbhuj place
 udhar commercial deal hoti hai
 You too have come on a commercial deal
 is baat ko taalte hue maine kaha- arunabh aap bade bhai hai
 i am not feeling well kya karnaa he bataaie
 We will go home
 tabhi usne achaanak meraa haath pakadaa or kaha madam thodaa role play karen
 i was surprised tab se yah rojaanaa hone laga
 i was repeatedly molested
 ek din ola kii team se hamaari meeting ho rahi thi
 Suddenly Arunabh got up from the meeting and went inside
 usne mujhe aawaaj di
 When i went inside, she said- there is less time, do it in a little hurry main awak use dekhati rahi
 After this i told him that i will go to the police
 is par usne kaha- police to meri jeb main he
 i also spoke to several senior officers on this, but no one helped me
 peedita ne apane blog main likhaa he ki uski or arunabh kumaar kii mulaakaat mumbai ke ek cafe main saal 2014 main hui thi
 Arunabh gave him a job in his company
 peedita or arunabh bihar ke ek hi shahar se hai
 He felt that he would get help from Arunabh, but all this happened to him within 21 days of the job
 iaiti classmet ko bhi nahin bakshkarunabh kumaar par keval uske saath kaam karne vaali mahilaon ne hi chhedchhad kaa aarope nahin lagayaa he, balki iaiti khadgpur main uske saath padhane vaali ek ladki ne bhi us par sansanikhej aarope lagaae hai
 He told the Hindi website The Quint - This incident happened to me in 2012 in Mumbai
 ham donon coffee pine ke liye ek saath gaye the
 At that time, Arunabh said to me - 'will you come to my house and dance with me
 ' main hairaan thi
 He asked me to dance naked in front of him
 padosi ne bhi lagaaya chhedchhad kaa aropaklasamet ke alaava arunabh kumaar kii ek padosi ne bhi likhaa he- ek din main uske studio ke baahar phone par baat kar rahi thi
 He gave me a voice and called inside
 main smil diya or tahalne lagi
 After this he told me that i had gone to Ratnagiri
 vahaan se aam lekar aayaa he
 He asked me if i would eat this? During this time he was trying to caress my whole body
 main dar gai
 Say no to him and give a punch and escaped from there
 vah uskaa iraadaa bhaap chuki thi ki vah mujhase kya chahta tha
 TVF member said that in the face of the allegations against Arunabh Kumar, Nidhi Bisht, tvf's core team member wrote on Facebook - 'TVF is one of the best places for women to work
 mere saath team TVF or khaskar arunabh behad sammaan ke saath pesh aate hai
 Of course this does not mean that everyone's experience is like that
 24 ghante pehle jab pehla blog aayaa, to maine ise puri tarah se khaarij kar diya
 i checked, but no record of the victim's office was found
 uske aarope puri tarah niraadhaar or bebuniyaad hai

 In such a situation, it is generally thought that both China and India will garner a lot of applause from their people
 lekin aisa nahin he
 In the headlines of the government circles and the press of India, the only ruse is that there is something wrong in this relationship
 bharat china ko jitna niryaat karata he, china uskaa do se teen guna zyada niryaat bharat ko karata he
 It is a common concept that China is using India's rapidly growing market to consume its ready-made items on a large scale, which is causing damage to India
 yahi khyaal maano mukhar hokar bharat kii ore se china ke khilaaf 1995 main daayar 154 anti damping maamalon ke rup main saamne aayaa jo world trade orgenigeshan main ek sadsy ke duusare ke khilaaf uthaae gaye ab tak ke maamalon kii sabase badi sankhya he

 If India is getting higher prices in the US and Europe for its goods and services, it should export to the markets there
 or agar use apni jarurat kii chijen or sevaayen china main sabase sasti mil rahi hai to unhen vahiin se khareednaa chahie
 Actually, limiting imports from China will not help much in solving the total current account deficit
 isse yahi hoga ki ve zyada manhage saplir kii ore rukh kar lenge jisase hamaari kharid-kshamta or vaastavik aay par asar padegaa
 As long as large amounts of net capital are coming in the form of foreign investment and external commercial borrowings in the country, current account losses of the same size cannot be avoided
 ek aam shikaayat rahi he ki bharat ke china ke saath kaarobaari rishte main ek aupniveshik pattern jhalkata he: yah china main bane maal kaa aayaat karata he, lekin uske liye kaccha maal khud hi use niryaat karata he
 This is certainly a matter of concern as India could not use this position of comparative advantage, but it is in a way a problem that is created within the country
 china mazdooron kii bhayankar kami or badhati mazdooree ke dabaav kaa saamana kar rahaa he jabaki bharat main anaupchaarik kshetra main shramikon kii ek vishaal aabaadi maujuud he, jise bina khaas mazdooree badaye sangathit kshetra main ikattha kar unki mehnat se gunvatttapurna utpaada taiyaar kiye ja sakate hai jo chini saamaanon ko angootha dikhaa saken
 But our rigid labor laws have tied our hands and we have no choice but to buy finished products in the organized sector of China which it is exporting wildly

 Today, China exports 10 times more clothes than India's exports
 afsos he ki bharat ke kapadon kaa kul niryaat 1993-94 ke 12 fisadi se teji se phisalata hua 2011-12 main 5 fisadi tak ludhak chukaa he
 India's biggest complaint to China is that it created bottlenecks in the export of Indian medicines and software products

 narendra modi ne apana ek chunavi vaayada aaj hi nibhaa diya
 At every rally in Uttar Pradesh, Modi said, 'clean everyone'
 sa se sapa, ba se basapa or k se congress
 The wave of Modi and the havoc of his commander Amit Shah
 upi se basapa, congress or sapa teenon saaf ho gaye
 Only the Gandhi family of Congress and the Yadav family of SP survived
 inke alaava sab haare or buree tarah haare
 Two important parties of the state, Bahujan Samaj Party of Mayawati and National Lok Dal of Chaudhary Ajit Singh could not even open the account
 basapa ke itihaas main ye pehla mauka he, jab vah chunaav main utre or jiro par atake
 And what Mulayam, Ajit Singh, who claims to handle the legacy of Chaudhary Charan Singh, his son's party also disappeared from the Lok Sabha
 jaahir he ki is record tod jeet ke baad bijepi kii nigaah vidhansabha chunaav par hogi, jisaki satta se vah 12 saal se dur he
 Rae Bareli retained Bahu's election for 80 Lok Sabha seats in Uttar Pradesh, BJP and its ally Apna Dal won 73 seats
 congress ke hisse ain do siten- sonia gandhi raibareli se or unke bete rahul gandhi amethi se
 Sonia's victory was still simple
 unhone bijepi ke ajay agarwal ko 3 lakh 53 hajaar voton se haraaya
 The BJP was not even doing much papad for the election here
 aakhri vakt main vakil sahab ko tikat dekar bhej diya
 Modi did not even rally here
 rahul gandhi ke chute pasinthmethi seat kii baat karen, to congress ke yuvaraj rahul gandhi ke paseene chhot gaye
 This time, Amethi, which the Gandhi family considered as his father, Rahul's sister Priyanka had to camp there
 aalochak to yahaan tak kehete hai ki amethi se rahul nahin, priyanka gandhi jiti hai
 Talking about statistics, Rahul Gandhi won the election with 79 thousand votes
 magar hakeekat ye he ki bijepi ne chunaav ke elaan ke kaaphi vakt baad yahaan se modi army kii ahm sipaahi smriti irani ko utaara
 In a short time, Smriti campaigned vigorously
 aakhri vakt main modi kii raily ne unhen mukaable main laa khadaa kiya
 For the first time, BJP got tremendous support from here

 The entire SP government camped to save Mulayam in this election held in the last phase

 The leader lived up to the last with the help of temptation and promises and then won elections with 66 thousand

 The two more seats that the SP got, also went to two family members

 Lalu Prasad Yadav and Nitish Kumar are completely different from each other — both superficially superficial, and fundamentally think very differently about their method and style of thinking
 ab inke raajnneetik shabdkosh main nai abhivyakti jud gai haih agar shatru ko nahin haraa sakate to uske hathiyaaron ko hi chura daalo
 In an interesting case of change of role, two fierce opponents have opted to wear each other
 nitish ko hazirajvaabi yaa shaayari se prem ke liye nahin janaa jaataa, lekin pichley hafte unhone jai ho kii tarj par parady banaakar logon ko hairat main daal diya
 When the next day Lalu too responded in a poignant manner, Nitish struck another verse
 is par lalu ne kuch hat kar kiyah ve gambhir ho gaye
 Bypassing the provocation, he responded with a cold, "we are doing serious politics
" ham ochhepan main samay jaaya nahin hone denge
 Now is the time to work towards the development of Bihar
 ''bihar kii raajnneeti ke apratyaashit sansar main, kai myth toote hai or kai nae saanche gadhe gaye hai
 This is not an old thing, when Lalu used to be the king of slogans and targeted with the arrows of his words and Nitish was an idol of patience and honesty
 aaj, lalu jahaan gambhir ho gaye hai, beshak yah gambhirtha banaavati hi he, vahiin nitish fabtiyaan kasne sareekhe vyangy kaa sahaara le rahe hai
 These two giants turned from friends to enemies have changed their faces
 chunaavon ke maukey par shaayad koi dabaa hua dar ubhar aayaa he jisane in donon ko ek-duusare kii bhoomika apnaane ko majaboor kiya he
 Lalu seems to have imbibed Nitish's cold-blooded character, while the Chief Minister of Bihar resorted to trivialities and mockery to appear confident
 is chunaav main daanv par bahut kuch laga hone ke chalate, donon hi netaa ek-duusare kii safalataa kii daastaan main agaadh aasthaa dikhaate najar aa rahe hai
 Assembly elections in the state are to be held in six phases from October 21
 inhen pichley do dashakon main sabase ahm chunaav mana ja rahaa he
 While Nitish and Lalu are dominant in these elections, on the other hand, the credibility of Congress General Secretary Rahul Gandhi is also at stake
 unhen yah siddh karnaa he ki uttar pradesh main unki safalataa kii gaatha koi alpakaalik yaa tukka bhar nahin he
 It is indeed astonishing to see Lalu, who has been hurting all his political rivals in the past, with intense mockery
 beshak unke tikhe vyangy unhen bahes kaa vishay banaate the lekin ve jaanate hai ki isaki keemat unki chhavi ko chukaani padi he
 Today, Lalu's political grammar has completely changed: it is very restrained in behavior and content
 haas-parihaas se dur, aisa lagata he ki in dinon, jinhen unke sabase kharaab dinon main se bataaya ja rahaa he, ve apane sarvshereshth or vaastaviktaa ke kareeb vaale bhaashan de rahe hai
 Unusually quiet, they are talking about everyone, including the Savarnas, who had achieved nothing but neglect in the rjd's 15-year rule
 lagata he, unke vichaaron ne bhi gambhirtha hasil kar lee he, kyonki unki pahchaan hameshaa se halkepan or vachaalata se hi judi rahi he
 There was a time when he did not care, but today when he has to climb a straight peak, he was in dire need to change his face so that his thoughts would not be understood as a joke
 or iske liye shaayad nitish kii vyavhaar style hi unke liye sabase badhiya vikalp thi
 On the other hand, critics are accusing Nitish of bringing lightness to the campaign and giving personal color to the attacks, while Nitish seems to be the most inattentive and is facing them whole heartedly
 yahi nahin, ateet main ek samay tha jab chutili tippaniyon par lalu kaa copirite mana jaataa tha, lekin is baar ''log apni umr chhipaane ke liye apane bal rang rahe hai'' jaise jumale nitish kii ore se aane lage hai
 Lalu initially reacted but now he is not doing so
 beshak nitish isse sahamat nahin honge lekin aisa lagata he ki lalu ko itane saalon tak asahaay banakar dekhne se rajd pramukh kaa rang ab un par haaavee ho gaya he
 It is no wonder that Nitish has given more than one setback to Lalu politically, but today as he prepares to face the biggest election of his career, it may be that the Chief Minister is desperate to be like his arch rival Feel the need is bich, lalu kisi bhi tikhe prahaar kaa jawaab nahin de rahe or bahut hi dhairya ke saath unka saamana kar rahe hai, or yah sari kavayad november 2005, jab rajd ko satta se baahar hona padaa tha, ke baad se saal rahi pidaa ko dur karne ke liye he
 After all, in this election hour, the leaders want to cover the faces they want to bury politically? Here they do not matter to dislike each other
 har koi us cheez ko apnaane main laga he jo uske paas na hokar duusare ke paas hua karti thi
 Lalu seemed to have everything that Nitish did not have - like the satire, the spotlight, the conscious mind and the color of localism when the opportunity arose
 duusari ore nitish ke paas har vah cheez thi jo duusare ko unke bare main yah sochane ke liye majaboor kare ki ve bahut soch-samajhakar chalane vaale sayaane netaa hai
 His image is that of a serious leader with the skills of tact and manipulation, humility and eloquence, and above all, analysis skills
 kya upar di gai do alag-alag visheshtaayen kisi ek shaks main ho sakati hai, agar aisa hota he to yah jaanaleva package siddh hoga
 Today, Lalu desperately needs to identify Nitish, because today when he is going to once again stake his claim on Bihar, he is well aware that the main point of his strategy to re-establish his roots is borrowed from Nitish's image
 It is necessary to take
 vahiin lalu ke josh-kharosh kaa nitish ke paas koi tod nahin he
 Today, he is well aware of the fact that the "nitish Factor", which won 32 out of 40 seats in Bihar in the Lok Sabha elections, has faded
 sambhawatah ve lalu jaise prachand saahas ke saath chunaav par apni nijee chhap chhodana chaahate hai
 His strategy seems to have traced back to the time of 2005 when his attack was on Lalu's "jungle Raj"
 or ve soch-samajhakar apni uplabdhiyon kaa bakhaan nahin kar rahe hai jo mutthi bhar hi hai
 Elections have always been fought on issues, but for the last two decades, elections in Bihar have remained man-centered
 pehle kabhi dost rah chuke do logon main ab kadavaahat puri tarah ghul chuki he or sandhi kii koi raah najar nahin aa rahi he
 The possibility is that in view of the coming battle, one person may paint himself in the color of the other so that he can remove the flaws within him to some extent

 "the Sikhs have paid the price for this precious piece of earth by paying their blood," says Tarlochan Singh, the 27-year-old son of Amrik Singh, the head of All India Sikh Students' Federation, killed along with Bhindranwale in Operation Bluestar

 Jathedar conferred on Babbar Khalsa International militant Balwant Rajoana with the title of 'living martyr' who is awaiting execution in 1995 for the murder of Punjab Chief Minister Beant Singh and 17 others
 1982 se 1994 ke bich algaavvaadi or aatanki sanghathan rahe dal khalsa ne ek din pehle hi 5 june ko bhindranvaale smarak ke nirmaan kaa jashn manaaya tha

 There is a tide of heavy emotions behind
 bhaawanaaon kaa jowar ab bhi apane ufaan par he
 45-year-old general secretary of Dal Khalsa, Kanwarpal Singh, says, "the construction of the memorial is a major achievement in achieving the ideals of Sant Bhindranwale
 '' kanvarpal singh pehle aatanki hua karte the
 He spent 14 years of his life in making the Khalistani hero as a political and religious figure in the mind of the Sikhs
 dal khalsa par se 6 agast, 1998 ko pratibandh hataa liya gaya tha or yah khalistaan kii sthapana ke uddeshy se ek khule sanghathan ke taur par kaam karne laga
 It gets a lot of money from Khalistan supporters sitting in Britain, America, Canada etc

 dilli ke preet vihaar police stesan main teble par rakhe is kaale rang ke helmet ne kai maheenon se police kii naak main dam kar rakhaa tha
 In search of this black helmet, several teams of Delhi Police had been scouring the streets for months
 is helmet ke chakkar main pichley ek maheene se dilli ke chappe-chappe par nakaabandi kar bikers kii checking bhi kii ja rahi thi
 After all, after hard work, this black helmet is now in the hands of the police
 aisa kya khaas he is helmet menjahir he ki is helmet ko lekar ab aapke man main kai sawaal bhi uth rahe honge
 You must be wondering what is there in this helmet that the entire Delhi Police was looking for it
 darasal aam-sa dikhne vaala kaale rang kaa ye helmet ek khaas gang ke liye ekstorshan matlab jabaran ugaahi kaa bada hathiyaar ban chukaa tha
 The target of which was traffic police personnel deployed on Delhi's roads and red lights
 gang ke kaam karne kaa tarika uda degaa hoshpulice ke mutabik, kaale rang ke is helmet main ek spai camera feet kiya gaya he
 These gangs forcibly offered bribes to traffic policemen deployed on the streets and as soon as someone got caught in their trap, they would be caught in the helmet's intelligence camera
 iske baad pulisavaalon se jabaran ugaahi kaa khel shuru ho jaataa tha
 According to the police, many times these gang traffic used to capture policemen on camera by taking challan money and then editing it in their own way and threatening the policemen for extortion
 police ne kaise pakadaa nakli patrakaron ke gang ko
 
 
 For the past several months, complaints of this gang were coming from Delhi Traffic Police, after which this gang started to be monitored
 is gang kaa dilli trephic police ko apane jaal main fansaane kaa tarika bhi ek dam nayab tha
 At first this gang bike used to have this helmet with spy camera and then broke the signal of a red light, as soon as the police personnel there caught them, they started their game

 But the policemen suspected them
 jaise hi inase hiraasat main lekar poochtacha hui, to jabaran ugaahi ke is khel kaa pardaafash ho gaya
 The Delhi Police has recovered 1 helmet, 2 spy cameras, a large number of button cameras and some visiting cards from this gang of fake journalists

 Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa has expelled her close aide Sasikala Natarajan from her party AIADMK

 The hanging sentence has been restored in the Nirbhaya case
 trial court, hai court or supreme court ne shuru se lekar ant tak faansee kii sazaa behaal rakhi he
 This case changed the legal processes and attitudes towards rape in India forever
 abhiyukton ke vakeelon ko aapatti thi ki saare abhiyukton ko samuhik sazaa sunai gai he
 Punishment was not decided according to the different role of everyone in crime and their social, economic, psychological background
 ise angrezi main mitegating factor kehete hai
 That means everyone was sentenced to death, while someone could be imprisoned for ten years
 supreme court ne in aapattiyon ko khaarij karte hue kaha ki jab ham puri satarkta or saavdhaanee ke saath uttejit karne vaali paristhiti or abhiyukti kii bhoomika or unki saamaajik aarthik paristhit ke bich tulana karte hai to ham is ekmaatr nishkarsh par pahunchane ke liye majaboor ho jate hai ki record par uplabdh anya paristhitiyon par uttejit karne vaali paristhitiyaan baari pad jaati hai
 Therefore, we come to this conclusion and get the verdict of the High Court to be hanged
 is faisle se alag raay rakhane kaa koi kaaran nazar nahin aata he
 Verbatim is not translation, it is emotion
 teen jajon kii bench ne ek saal kii sunwaayee ke baad faisla diya he
 The three judges gave the verdict with consent and clapped in court when the verdict was delivered
 court cover karne vaale samvaadadaataaon ko thodi hairaani hui
 We will focus on the decision in prime time today, those who participate in the debate also need time to read the 429 page decision, so we will not debate with them today
 ham bhi puraa faisla nahin pard sake hai lekin maanate hai ki iske kuch hisson ko aapke saamne rakhana chahie
 Nirbhaya's parents have said that they have got justice
 wo shuru se faansee kii maang kar rahe the, or faansee kii sazaa ant ant tak behaal rahi he
 We all know only one word that justice was received, maybe this parent also has the same word for us that justice has been received, but imagine how many times a day they will be going through that incident from 16th December onwards
 unki pratikriya main ek zimmedaar naagarik kaa samvidhan or kanoonee prakriya main vishwaas hi to he jo har haal main unhen zindaa rakhe hue he
 He kept giving them courage to fight
 nirbhaya kii maa kaa naam aashaa he
 Saleha's mother's name is not Asha, Bilkis, if Bilkis did not have the same hope, she would not have seen the courtroom for 17 years
 bombai hai court ne is maa ko bhi niraash nahin kiya he
 We will also cover the part of Bilkis but first read the part of the judgment of Justice Deepak Mishra and Justice Ashok Bhushan which has brought about the subject of collective consciousness
 jaj sahiban likhte hai ki sex kii chaah, hinsa kii bhukh, taaqatvar hone kii sthiti or vikrut vruti, ne samuhik chetana ko hilaa diya jo nahin jaanata ki kya karnaa he
 It is evident that the lustful desire, the slavery of free work desires and the slavery of animal-like abusive desire led the appellants to crime which brought a tsunami of shock to the collective consciousness and completely destroyed the civilized fabric of the surroundings
 ye shabdash: anuwaad nahin he
 Justice Mishra's English is also good and Nafees
 isliye kuch galati ho sakati he
 But only this part of the Judgment can spark a long debate on the frustrations of Indian society
 ham sirf samuhik chetana tak hi khud ko simit rakhte hue kuch kahana chaahate hai
 Keep in mind one thing, the decision has not been taken on the basis of or for collective consciousness
 aisa samajhnaa faisle ke mahatv ko kam karnaa hoga magar zikr he or kai log ise galat samaj sakate hai isliye yahaan bilkis baanon kaa prasang laana chahta hum
 On May 4, the Bombay High Court delivered a verdict in the Bilkis Ban case related to the Gujarat riots
 is maamle main 12 logon ko umr kaid kii sazaa sunai gai, iske alaava paanch police afasar or do doctor bhi sabooton ko mitaane ke maamle main doshi paae gaye
 That is, the general public as well as members of the state were also involved in the violence against the Bilkis Ban
 bombai hai court ne is maamle main sibiai kii daleel ko sahi mana
 For 19 years, Bilkis Ban has been fighting for his justice, but is there any collective consciousness with Bilkis
 isiilie samuhik chetana jaise shabd kii samiksha zaruri he
 Did the collective consciousness distract that 19-year-old Bilkis was raped when she was pregnant
 kya samuhik chetana vichlit hui jab uski bacchee ko usase chhina gaya or ek pathar par sir patakar kar maar diya gaya
 Did collective consciousness awaken when Bilkis was raped along with his mother and sister
 kya samuhik chetana us vakt sadakon par utari thi jab bilkis kii beti or uske parivaar ke 14 log maar diye gaye the
 Bilkis did not say that he would agree on being hanged, yet the reactions of Saleha's mother Bilkis and Nirbhaya's mother Asha ji are quite significant
 bilkis ne saavdhaan kiya he ki ham dharmon ke naam par is tarah apane hosh na ganvaa baithen
 He bharatvasiyon gujaratvaasiyon ko shukriya kaha he
 Many people may be thinking that what happened to Bilkis was the collective consciousness after Godhra
 aap sikh bhaaiyon se puuchhiye 84 kii dilli main sadakon par koun si samuhik chetana thi
 Therefore, one should be alert from collective consciousness
 har samuhik chetana acchhee nahin hoti he
 After hearing for a year, a three-judge bench headed by Justice Deepak Mishra has given the verdict
 abhiyukton ko puraa mauka diya gaya apana paksh rakhane kaa
 a cursory reading showed that Justice Mishra had written the verdict very carefully and cautiously
 kai rajyon main is tarah ke maamalon main jo faisle hue hai, unka udhaaharan diya he
 The cases of Rajasthan, Bihar, Maharashtra, UP, Jammu Kashmir, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh were mentioned in the judgment as a reference
 yah baat thik he ki raisina hills par pahunchi ladkiyaan sirf bheed nahin thim
 They cannot be dismissed as a crowd
 is bheed main bahut si ladkiyaan apane jivan main pehali baar kisi mudde ke liye ghar se nikali thim
 She did not come as a mob to kill anyone but was awakening the Constitution and the law
 samuhik chetana ke naam par raisina par ain ladakiyon kii bheed ko riject karnaa galati hogi
 You cannot compare this mob to the mob that kills Ghulam Mohammad in Bulandshahr on the charge of loving a Hindu girl, who kills Kishor Khan in the name of cow protection in Alwar
 raisina par jamaa hui ladakiyon ke haath main jo binar the, wo behatar or sanvaidhanik samaaj ke sapane dekh rahe the
 This decision is historic
 yah ghatana vaaki bhayanak thi
 So terrible that even today, while referring to his episodes, shuddering arises
 justise mishra ne apane faisle kii shuruuaat is tarah se karte hai
 
 
 
 16 disambar 2012 kii dilli kii sard bhari shaam ne apane saathi ke saath piviar salect city main film dekhne gai 23 saal kii ladki ko zaraa bhi bhanak nahin di hogi ki agle kuch ghanton main, tej hoti kanpakapaahat bhari raat uski zindagi main ek bhayanak andhera laane vaali he
 When she will board the bus with her friend from Munirka bus stand
 usne sochaa bhi nahin hoga ki wo chah logon ke gang kii havas kaa shikaar hone ja rahi he, usapar jaanaleva hamalaa hoga, wo unke liye mouj masti kaa zariyaa ban jaaegi or nijee angon ko chhin bhinn kar diya jayega, ek aisi bhukh ke liye jiske bare main kisi ne sochaa nahin hoga
 Literally not a translation, but the way Judge Sahiban started writing, the first two to three paragraphs of the verdict get heavy
 padhaa nahin jaataa he
 The accused wanted that if the execution of the sentence is being done, then every aspect should be properly heard
 supreme court ne unhen puraa mauka diya
 The counsel for the accused was concerned that the FIR was delayed
 matlab saboot ke saath chhedchhad hui he lekin hameshaa yah baat sahi nahin hoti he
 There has been a long debate on the question of delay in the FIR
 faisle kaa padhenge to kam se kam sattar pannon tak yahi bahes chal rahi he
 The court has written in its judgment that doubting the delay depends on several reasons
 haalanki lambii deree bhi maaf kii ja sakati he agar peedit ke paas motive nahin he abhiyukt ko fansaane kaa
 In this case, the victims were admitted to the hospital at 11:05 pm
 3:45 par peedit ladke kaa bayaan record kiya gaya
 Initially, primary care is to provide medical assistance to the victims
 agar maan bhi liya jaae ki deree hui to ye bilkul maanviya he
 Another question was that the names of the accused in the FIR and Medico legal case were not registered, then the court said that the FIR is not an encyclopedia
 peedit se ummid nahin kii jaati ki wo ghatana kii puri jaankaree exiaar main hi de
 In this way, one question has been heard
 epa ai aar main deree kii tarah daaing diclaration ko lekar bhi sawaal uthaa, is par bhi lambii bahes chali he magar court ne apane faisle main kaha ki hamen yah maanane main koi dikkt nahin he ki haav-bhav, ishaare se koi daaing dicleration darj hota he, use sakshya ke taur par manyata di ja sakati he
 Provided that due care has been taken while recording the statement
 hamaare record par jo sakshya uplabdh hai uske aadhaar par sabhi teenon daaing dicleration main ek tarah kii nirantarata dikhti he yani teenon main kaaphi mail he, or anya saakshyon ke saath unka milan bhi hota he
 Therefore, the trial court, the High Court has considered the basis of Dyeing Declaration in sentencing
 faisle kaa anuwaad ek mushkil kaam he
 Nevertheless, this decision will make us more literate than all the debate because the judges have written deeply on all aspects
 bahuton ko lag saktaa he ki yah faisla faansee ke faislon ko badhaava dene vaala he to aisa sochna jaldbaazi hogi
 Rather, on the 402 number page, Justice Mishra and Justice Bhushan write that whether the case is the rarest of rare or not, the process of execution in India has developed a lot due to many policy reforms and judicial decisions, it shows that hanging What has been our view at different times about the punishment, of course, the possibilities of improvement in punishment are ahead and India's international responsibility is also reflected Persons sentenced to death has changed the attitude of the courts
 bharat main faansee kii sazaa kaa shater band hone kii taraf bad rahaa he lekin reerest of rer maamle main ek choti si khidki khuli hui he
 If the correct translation is done, this part shows that the court is not blind to the execution of the sentence
 wo is disha main tamaam sabooton or tarkon ke aadhaar par bad rahi he
 Used a small window that is open
 isliye ek insaaf yah bhi he ki faisle ko padhaa jaae
 Justice r Bhanumathi's comment is also important in this judgment
 wo likhti hai, mahaan vidwaan vivekanand ke shabdon main kisi bhi raashtra kii pragati kaa sabase acha tharmametre yah he ki vah auraton ke saath kya saluk karata he
 Crime against women not only hurts their self-esteem but also stops the development of society
 main ummid karti hum ki rajdhani main hui is jaghanya ghatana or ek noujvaan ladki kii maut se ek janandolan ubharegaa jo ek mahilaon ke khilaaf hinsa ko khatm karegaa
 Comments aamtaur par jajon ke faisle main shakespeare, vardsaworth, yeats ko hi kot kiya jaataa he, bahut dinon baad dekha ki vivekanand ko kot kiya gaya he
 this is fine
 balaatkaar ke khilaaf yah ladaai lambii he
 The collective consciousness of the Nirbhaya case is often silenced in those cases which have been victimizing the weaker sections of society away from Delhi
 bilkis baanon jaisi auraton or saikadon anaam dalit ladakiyon ke saath hone vaale balaatkaar ke maamle main jis din bharat kii mahilayen raisina pahunch jaaengi us din auraton kii ladaai auraton kii ban jaaegi
 Strict laws and strict punishment affect the crime
 padataa to dilli main har din balaatkaar ke chah maamle darj nahin hote
 According to the National Crime Records Bureau, 33,707 rape cases were registered in 2013
 2014 main balaatkaar ke 36,735 maamle darj hue
 In 2015, 34,651 cases of rape were reported
 is puure maamle ko hamaare sahyogi ashish bhargav ne kaaphi zimmedaari ke saath cover kiya he
 Ashish is not as fortunate as the reporters or anchors whose photo appears on the hoarding, but every report of this reporter teaches us something in the news
 ashish ne bataaya ki teen jajon kii bench special bench thi
 There is also a law to sit on this bench
 bench ke pramukh justise deepak mishra bich main baithte hai
 On his right was Junior Justice r Bhanumati seated with him
 justise mishra ke baayin or justise ashok bhushan baithe the jo in teenon main sabase junior hai
 The bench has held hearings on Monday, Friday and Saturday for one year
 44 se zyaada hearing hui hai
 Rather, in the case of mitigating factor, there was a second hearing from March 6, that is, the question on which the matter reached the Supreme Court was heard twice in a year
 jajon ne koi jaldbaazi nahin dikhaai
 The Supreme Court also provided two big lawyers to help the accused lawyers of justice
 raju ramchandran or sanjay hegade
 Both of them questioned a lot about the investigation of Delhi Police and the decision of Delhi High Court
 yani har sawaal ko mauka mila
 The Delhi Police's investigation into the final verdict has been praised
 shabdash: anuwaad nahin he, bhav he
 The three-judge bench has given the verdict after a year's hearing
 teenon jajon ne sahmati se faisla diya or jab faisla sunaaya to court main tali baji
 The reporters covering the court were surprised
 ham aaj prime time main faisle par hi focus karenge, bahes main hissaa lene waalon ko bhi 429 pej ke faisle ko padhane kaa vakt chahie isliye ham aaj unke saath bahes nahin karenge
 We also have not been able to read the entire decision but believe that some parts of it should be put before you
 nirbhaya ke mata pita ne kaha he ki unhen insaaf mila he
 They were demanding execution from the beginning, and the execution of the sentence has been restored till the end
 ham sab to ek hi shabd jaanate hai ki insaaf mila, ho saktaa he is maa baap ke paas bhi hamaare liye yahi shabd ho ki insaaf mil gaya, lekin sochiye ki 16 disambar ke baad se wo din main kitni baar us haadase se guzarate honge
 In their response, a responsible citizen has faith in the constitution and legal process which is keeping them alive
 unhen ladane kii himmat detaa rahaa
 Nirbhaya's mother's name is Asha
 saaleha kii maa kaa naam aashaa nahin he, bilkis he, agar bilkis ke paas bhi yahi aashaa nahin hoti to 17 saal tak adaalat kaa aasraa nahin dekhati
 The Bombay High Court has not disappointed this mother either
 ham bilkis ke hisse ko bhi isamen shaamil karenge lekin pehle justise deepak mishra or justise ashok bhushan ke faisle ke us hisse ko padhate hai jisamen samuhik chetana kaa prasang aayaa he
 Judge Sahiban writes that the desire for sex, a hunger for violence, a state of vigor and a distorted nature have shaken the collective consciousness which does not know what to do
 yah zaahir he ki lanpat ichha, mukt kaam ichchhaaon kii gulaami or jaanwaron jaisi ghinauni chaah kii daastaa apilkartaaon ko gunaah kii taraf le gai jisane samuhik chetana main sadame kii tsunami laa di or parivesh ke sabhy taane bane ko puri tarah dhwast kar diya
 It is not a literal translation
 justise mishra kii angrezi he bhi acchhee or nafis
 Therefore, there may be some mistake
 magar jajment ke sirf is hisse par bhartiya samaaj kii kunthaon par lambii bahes chhid sakati he
 We want to say something while keeping ourselves limited to the collective consciousness
 ek baat dhyaan rakhiyegaa, faisla samuhik chetana ke aadhaar yaa uske liye nahin liya gaya he
 Understanding this will have to reduce the importance of the decision but there is a mention and many people may misunderstand it, so i want to bring the context of Bilkis Ban
 4 may ko bombai hai court ne gujarat dangon se jude bilkis baanon cese main ek faisla sunaaya
 In this case, 12 people were sentenced to life imprisonment, besides five police officers and two doctors were also found guilty of erasing evidence
 yani aam janata ke saath-saath state yani rajya ke sadsy bhi bilkis baanon ke khilaaf hui hinsa main shaamil the
 The Bombay High Court upheld the cbi's plea in the case
 19 saal se bilkis baanon apane insaaf kii ladaai lard rahi he lekin kya bilkis ke saath koi samuhik chetana he
 That is why it is important to review a word like collective consciousness
 kya samuhik chetana is baat se vichlit hui ki 19 saal kii bilkis ke saath balaatkaar tab hua jab vah garbhvatee thi
 Was the collective consciousness disturbed when her child was snatched from her and beheaded on a stone
 kya samuhik chetana us samay jaagi jab bilkis kii maa or bahan ke saath rape kiya gaya
 Did collective consciousness hit the streets when Bilkis' daughter and 14 of her family were killed
 bilkis ne yah nahin kaha ki faansee se kam par maanenge phir bhi saaleha kii maa bilkis or nirbhaya kii maa aashaa ji kii pratikriyaayein kaaphi mahatvapurn hai
 Bilkis has cautioned that we should not lose our senses in the name of religions
 usne The people of India have thanked the people of Gujarat
 bahut se log soch rahe honge ki bilkis ke saath jo hua wo godhra ke baad kii samuhik chetana thi
 Ask the Sikh brothers what was the collective consciousness of 84 in the streets of Delhi
 isliye samuhik chetana se satark rahanaa chahie
 Not every collective consciousness is good
 ek saal tak sunne ke baad justise deepak mishra kii adhyakshata main teen jajon kii bench ne faisla diya he
 The accused were given full opportunity to present their case
 sarsari taur par padhate hue laga ki justise mishra ne kaaphi saavdhaanee or satarkta se faisla likhaa he
 Many states have given examples of decisions taken in such cases
 rajasthan, bihar, maharashtra, upi, jammu kashmir, andhra pradesh, madhyapradesh ke maamalon kaa zikr faisle main sandarbh ke taur par dikhaa
 It is true that the girls who reached Raisina Hills were not just crowded
 inhen bheed kahkar khaarij nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Many of the girls in this crowd had left home for the first time in their lives for an issue
 wo bheed banakar kisi ko maarane nahin ai thim balki samvidhan or kanoon ko jagaa rahi thim
 It would be a mistake to reject the crowd of girls who came to Raisina in the name of collective consciousness
 is bheed kii tulana aap us bheed se nahin kar sakate jo bulandshahr main gulam mohammad ko hindu ladki se prem karne ke aarope main maar detii he, jo alvar main gau raksha ke naam par pahalu khan ko maar detii he
 The banners held in the hands of the girls gathered on Raisina, they were dreaming of a better and constitutional society
 yah faisla aitihaasik he
 This incident was really terrible
 itani bhayanak ki aaj bhi uske prasangon kaa zikr karte hue siharan paidaa ho jaati he
 Justice Mishra begins his decision in this way
 
 
 
 The chilly evening of 16 December 2012 in Delhi, along with her partner in the PVR Select City, would not have given the 23-year-old girl any inkling that in the next few hours, a booming night would bring a terrible darkness to her life
 Is supposed to jab wo muniraka bas stand se apane dost ke saath bas main savaar hogi
 She would not have imagined that she was going to fall prey to the lust of a gang of six people, she would be subjected to a murderous attack, it would become a source of fun for them and her personal organs would be severed, for a hunger Nobody would have thought about that
 shabdash: anuwaad nahin he, magar jaj sahiban ne jis tarah se likhnaa shuru kiya he, faisle ke pehle do teen paragraph se hi man baari ho jaataa he
 Is not read
 aaropee chaahate the ki faansee kii sazaa ho rahi he to har pahalu par thik se sunwaayee ho jaae
 The Supreme Court gave him full opportunity
 aropiyon ke vakil kaa sawaal tha ki exiaar main deree hui
 Meaning the evidence has been tampered with but this is not always true
 exiaar main deree ke sawaal par hi lambii bahes chali he
 If you read the verdict, this debate is going on for at least seventy pages
 court ne apane faisle main likhaa he ki deree par shaq karnaa kai vajahon par nirbhar karata he
 However long delays can also be forgiven if the victim does not have motive to implicate the accused
 is cese main peediton ko 11:05 par aspataal main bharti karaayaa gaya
 The statement of the victim boy was recorded at 3:45
 shuruyaat main praathamikta peediton ko medical sahaayta dene kii hoti he
 Even if it is to be delayed, it is absolutely human
 ek doosraa sawaal tha ki exiaar or medico legal cese main aropiyon ke naam darj nahin the to court ne kaha ki exiaar koi encychlopedia nahin hoti he
 The victim is not expected to give complete information about the incident in the FIR itself
 is tarah se ek ek sawaal par sunwaayee hui he
 Like the delay in the FIR, there was a long debate on dyeing declaration as well, but the court said in its judgment that we have no right to believe that any gesture would have been recorded by gesture, gesture Yes, it can be recognized as evidence
 basharte bayaan darj karte vakt puri saavdhaanee barti gai ho
 On the basis of the evidence available on our records, there is a kind of consistency in all the three dyeing declarations i
e
 all three are quite similar, and they are also matched with other evidence
 isliye trial court, hoicourt ne sazaa dene main daaing dicleration ko jo aadhaar mana he, wo sahi he
 Translation of judgment is a difficult task
 phir bhi tamaam bahes se zyada yah faisla hamen sakshar karegaa kyonki jajon ne tamaam pahaluon par gaharaai se likhaa he
 Many may feel that this decision is going to promote the decisions of hanging, so it is too early to think
 balki 402 number pej par justise mishra or justise bhushan likhte hai ki yah cese reerest of rer he yaa nahin, bharat main faansee kii sazaa kii prakriya kai nitigat sudhaaron or nyaayik faislon ke kaaran ab kaaphi viksit ho chuki he, isse pataa chalata he ki faansee kii sazaa ko lekar alag-alag samay main hamaara kya nazariyaa rahaa he, beshak sazaa dene main sudhaar kii sambhaavnaaon kaa paksh aage rahata he or bharat kaa antarrashtriya daayitv bhi jhalkata he ki faansee kii sazaa ko lekar adaalaton kaa nazariyaa badla he
 In India, the death penalty shutter is moving towards closure, but in the case of rarest of rare, a small window is open
 agar sahi anuwaad hua he to yah hissaa bataata he ki adaalat faansee kii sazaa kii andh samarthak nahin he
 She is growing in this direction based on all the evidence and arguments
 choti si jo khidki khuli hui he uskaa istemaal kiya he
 Therefore, it is also a judgment that the verdict be read
 is faisle main justise aar bhaanumati kii tippanee bhi mahatvapurn he
 She writes, in the words of the great scholar Vivekananda, the best thermometer of the progress of any nation is what it treats women
 auraton ke kilaaf aparaadh se na sirf unka swabhimaan aahat hota he balki samaaj ke vikaas kii gati bhi ruk jaati he
 i hope that this heinous incident in the capital and the death of a young girl will lead to a mass movement that will end violence against women
 'tippaniyan Shakespeare, Wordsworth, Yeats are usually quoted in the judgment of the judges, seen long after that Vivekananda has been quoted
 ye thik he
 This fight against rape is long
 nirbhaya maamle kaa samuhik chetana aksar un maamalon main khamosh rah jaataa he jo dilli se dur samaaj ke kamazor tabake ko apana shikaar bana rahaa hota he
 In the case of rape of women such as Bilkis Ban and hundreds of unnamed Dalit girls, the day when the women of India reach Raisina, the fight for women will become women
 kade kanoon or sakht sazaa se aparaadh par kya asar padataa he
 If not, six cases of rape would not have been filed in Delhi every day
 rashtriya aparaadh ricard beuro ke anusaar 2013 main balaatkaar ke 33,707 maamle darj hue
 In 2014, there were 36,735 rape cases reported
 2015 main balaatkaar ke 34,651 maamle darj hue
 This entire matter has been covered with great responsibility by our colleague Ashish Bhargava
 ashish un samvaadadaataaon yaa ankaron jitne kismatwale nahin hai jinka photo hording par lagata he magar is samvaadadaata kii har report news main hamen kuch na kuch sikhaa jaati he
 Ashish said that the bench of three judges was a special bench
 is bench ke baithne kaa bhi ek kaayda hota he
 The head of the bench, Justice Deepak Mishra, sits in the middle
 unki daayin ore unase junior justise aar bhaanumati baithi thim
 To the left of Justice Mishra and Justice Ashok Bhushan was seated, who is the most junior of these three
 is bench ne ek saal tak somvaar, shuukravaar or shanivaar ko sunwaayee kii he
 There are more than 44 hearings
 balki mitegating factor vaale maamle main to 6 march se dobaaraa hearing hui yani jis sawaal ko lekar yah maamla supreme court pahunchaa tha us sawaal par ek saal main do baar sunwaayee hui
 The judges showed no haste
 insaaf kaa palada baari lage isliye aropiyon ke vakeelon kii madad ke liye supreme court ne do bade vakil bhi upabaldh karaaye
 Raju Ramachandran and Sanjay Hegde
 in donon ne dilli police kii jaanch or dilli hoicourt ke faisle par khub sawaal kiye
 That means every question got a chance
 final faisle main dilli police kii jaanch kii saraahna kii gai he
 Nirbhaya's parents have said that they have got justice
 wo shuru se faansee kii maang kar rahe the, or faansee kii sazaa ant ant tak behaal rahi he
 We all know only one word that justice was received, maybe this parent also has the same word for us that justice has been received, but imagine how many times a day they will be going through that incident from 16th December onwards
 unki pratikriya main ek zimmedaar naagarik kaa samvidhan or kanoonee prakriya main vishwaas hi to he jo har haal main unhen zindaa rakhe hue he
 He kept giving them courage to fight
 nirbhaya kii maa kaa naam aashaa he
 Saleha's mother's name is not Asha, Bilkis, if Bilkis did not have the same hope, she would not have seen the courtroom for 17 years
 bombai hai court ne is maa ko bhi niraash nahin kiya he
 We will also cover the part of Bilkis but first read the part of the judgment of Justice Deepak Mishra and Justice Ashok Bhushan which has brought about the subject of collective consciousness
 jaj sahiban likhte hai ki sex kii chaah, hinsa kii bhukh, taaqatvar hone kii sthiti or vikrut vruti, ne samuhik chetana ko hilaa diya jo nahin jaanata ki kya karnaa he
 It is evident that the lustful desire, the slavery of free work desires and the slavery of animal-like abusive desire led the appellants to crime which brought a tsunami of shock to the collective consciousness and completely destroyed the civilized fabric of the surroundings
 ye shabdash: anuwaad nahin he
 Justice Mishra's English is also good and Nafees
 isliye kuch galati ho sakati he
 But only this part of the Judgment can spark a long debate on the frustrations of Indian society
 ham sirf samuhik chetana tak hi khud ko simit rakhte hue kuch kahana chaahate hai
 Keep in mind one thing, the decision has not been taken on the basis of or for collective consciousness
 aisa samajhnaa faisle ke mahatv ko kam karnaa hoga magar zikr he or kai log ise galat samaj sakate hai isliye yahaan bilkis baanon kaa prasang laana chahta hum
 On May 4, the Bombay High Court delivered a verdict in the Bilkis Ban case related to the Gujarat riots
 is maamle main 12 logon ko umr kaid kii sazaa sunai gai, iske alaava paanch police afasar or do doctor bhi sabooton ko mitaane ke maamle main doshi paae gaye
 That is, the general public as well as members of the state were also involved in the violence against the Bilkis Ban
 bombai hai court ne is maamle main sibiai kii daleel ko sahi mana
 For 19 years, Bilkis Ban has been fighting for his justice, but is there any collective consciousness with Bilkis
 isiilie samuhik chetana jaise shabd kii samiksha zaruri he
 Did the collective consciousness distract that 19-year-old Bilkis was raped when she was pregnant
 kya samuhik chetana vichlit hui jab uski bacchee ko usase chhina gaya or ek pathar par sir patakar kar maar diya gaya
 Did collective consciousness awaken when Bilkis was raped along with his mother and sister
 kya samuhik chetana us vakt sadakon par utari thi jab bilkis kii beti or uske parivaar ke 14 log maar diye gaye the
 Bilkis did not say that he would agree on being hanged, yet the reactions of Saleha's mother Bilkis and Nirbhaya's mother Asha ji are quite significant
 bilkis ne saavdhaan kiya he ki ham dharmon ke naam par is tarah apane hosh na ganvaa baithen
 He bharatvasiyon gujaratvaasiyon ko shukriya kaha he
 Many people may be thinking that what happened to Bilkis was the collective consciousness after Godhra
 aap sikh bhaaiyon se puuchhiye 84 kii dilli main sadakon par koun si samuhik chetana thi
 Therefore, one should be alert from collective consciousness
 har samuhik chetana acchhee nahin hoti he
 After hearing for a year, a three-judge bench headed by Justice Deepak Mishra has given the verdict
 abhiyukton ko puraa mauka diya gaya apana paksh rakhane kaa
 a cursory reading showed that Justice Mishra had written the verdict very carefully and cautiously
 kai rajyon main is tarah ke maamalon main jo faisle hue hai, unka udhaaharan diya he
 The cases of Rajasthan, Bihar, Maharashtra, UP, Jammu Kashmir, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh were mentioned in the judgment as a reference
 yah baat thik he ki raisina hills par pahunchi ladkiyaan sirf bheed nahin thim
 They cannot be dismissed as a crowd
 is bheed main bahut si ladkiyaan apane jivan main pehali baar kisi mudde ke liye ghar se nikali thim
 She did not come as a mob to kill anyone but was awakening the Constitution and the law
 samuhik chetana ke naam par raisina par ain ladakiyon kii bheed ko riject karnaa galati hogi
 You cannot compare this mob to the mob that kills Ghulam Mohammad in Bulandshahr on the charge of loving a Hindu girl, who kills Kishor Khan in the name of cow protection in Alwar
 raisina par jamaa hui ladakiyon ke haath main jo binar the, wo behatar or sanvaidhanik samaaj ke sapane dekh rahe the
 This decision is historic
 yah ghatana vaaki bhayanak thi
 So terrible that even today, while referring to his episodes, shuddering arises
 justise mishra ne apane faisle kii shuruuaat is tarah se karte hai
 
 
 
 16 disambar 2012 kii dilli kii sard bhari shaam ne apane saathi ke saath piviar salect city main film dekhne gai 23 saal kii ladki ko zaraa bhi bhanak nahin di hogi ki agle kuch ghanton main, tej hoti kanpakapaahat bhari raat uski zindagi main ek bhayanak andhera laane vaali he
 When she will board the bus with her friend from Munirka bus stand
 usne sochaa bhi nahin hoga ki wo chah logon ke gang kii havas kaa shikaar hone ja rahi he, usapar jaanaleva hamalaa hoga, wo unke liye mouj masti kaa zariyaa ban jaaegi or nijee angon ko chhin bhinn kar diya jayega, ek aisi bhukh ke liye jiske bare main kisi ne sochaa nahin hoga
 Literally not a translation, but the way Judge Sahiban started writing, the first two to three paragraphs of the verdict get heavy
 padhaa nahin jaataa he
 The accused wanted that if the execution of the sentence is being done, then every aspect should be properly heard
 supreme court ne unhen puraa mauka diya
 The counsel for the accused was concerned that the FIR was delayed
 matlab saboot ke saath chhedchhad hui he lekin hameshaa yah baat sahi nahin hoti he
 There has been a long debate on the question of delay in the FIR
 faisle kaa padhenge to kam se kam sattar pannon tak yahi bahes chal rahi he
 The court has written in its judgment that doubting the delay depends on several reasons
 haalanki lambii deree bhi maaf kii ja sakati he agar peedit ke paas motive nahin he abhiyukt ko fansaane kaa
 In this case, the victims were admitted to the hospital at 11:05 pm
 3:45 par peedit ladke kaa bayaan record kiya gaya
 Initially the priority is to provide medical assistance to the victims
 agar maan bhi liya jaae ki deree hui to ye bilkul maanviya he
 Another question was that the names of the accused in the FIR and Medico legal case were not registered, then the court said that the FIR is not an encyclopedia
 peedit se ummid nahin kii jaati ki wo ghatana kii puri jaankaree exiaar main hi de
 In this way, one question has been heard
 epa ai aar main deree kii tarah daaing diclaration ko lekar bhi sawaal uthaa, is par bhi lambii bahes chali he magar court ne apane faisle main kaha ki hamen yah maanane main koi dikkt nahin he ki haav-bhav, ishaare se koi daaing dicleration darj hota he, use sakshya ke taur par manyata di ja sakati he
 Provided that due care has been taken while recording the statement
 hamaare record par jo sakshya uplabdh hai uske aadhaar par sabhi teenon daaing dicleration main ek tarah kii nirantarata dikhti he yani teenon main kaaphi mail he, or anya saakshyon ke saath unka milan bhi hota he
 Therefore, the trial court, the High Court has considered the basis of Dyeing Declaration in sentencing
 faisle kaa anuwaad ek mushkil kaam he
 Nevertheless, this decision will make us more literate than all the debate because the judges have written deeply on all aspects
 bahuton ko lag saktaa he ki yah faisla faansee ke faislon ko badhaava dene vaala he to aisa sochna jaldbaazi hogi
 Rather, on the 402 number page, Justice Mishra and Justice Bhushan write that whether the case is the rarest of rare or not, the process of execution in India has developed a lot due to many policy reforms and judicial decisions, it shows that hanging What has been our view at different times about the punishment, of course, the possibilities of improvement in punishment are ahead and India's international responsibility is also reflected Persons sentenced to death has changed the attitude of the courts
 bharat main faansee kii sazaa kaa shater band hone kii taraf bad rahaa he lekin reerest of rer maamle main ek choti si khidki khuli hui he
 If the correct translation is done, this part shows that the court is not blind to the execution of the sentence
 wo is disha main tamaam sabooton or tarkon ke aadhaar par bad rahi he
 Used a small window that is open
 isliye ek insaaf yah bhi he ki faisle ko padhaa jaae
 Justice r Bhanumathi's comment is also important in this judgment
 wo likhti hai, mahaan vidwaan vivekanand ke shabdon main kisi bhi raashtra kii pragati kaa sabase acha tharmametre yah he ki vah auraton ke saath kya saluk karata he
 Crime against women not only hurts their self-esteem but also stops the development of society
 main ummid karti hum ki rajdhani main hui is jaghanya ghatana or ek noujvaan ladki kii maut se ek janandolan ubharegaa jo ek mahilaon ke khilaaf hinsa ko khatm karegaa
 Comments aamtaur par jajon ke faisle main shakespeare, vardsaworth, yeats ko hi kot kiya jaataa he, bahut dinon baad dekha ki vivekanand ko kot kiya gaya he
 this is fine
 balaatkaar ke khilaaf yah ladaai lambii he
 The collective consciousness of the Nirbhaya case is often silenced in those cases which have been victimizing the weaker sections of society away from Delhi
 bilkis baanon jaisi auraton or saikadon anaam dalit ladakiyon ke saath hone vaale balaatkaar ke maamle main jis din bharat kii mahilayen raisina pahunch jaaengi us din auraton kii ladaai auraton kii ban jaaegi
 Strict laws and strict punishment affect the crime
 padataa to dilli main har din balaatkaar ke chah maamle darj nahin hote
 According to the National Crime Records Bureau, 33,707 rape cases were registered in 2013
 2014 main balaatkaar ke 36,735 maamle darj hue
 In 2015, 34,651 cases of rape were reported
 is puure maamle ko hamaare sahyogi ashish bhargav ne kaaphi zimmedaari ke saath cover kiya he
 Ashish is not as fortunate as the reporters or anchors whose photo appears on the hoarding, but every report of this reporter teaches us something in the news
 ashish ne bataaya ki teen jajon kii bench special bench thi
 There is also a law to sit on this bench
 bench ke pramukh justise deepak mishra bich main baithte hai
 On his right was Junior Justice r Bhanumati seated with him
 justise mishra ke baayin or justise ashok bhushan baithe the jo in teenon main sabase junior hai
 The bench has held hearings on Monday, Friday and Saturday for one year
 44 se zyaada hearing hui hai
 Rather, in the case of mitigating factor, there was a second hearing from March 6, that is, the question on which the matter reached the Supreme Court was heard twice in a year
 jajon ne koi jaldbaazi nahin dikhaai
 The Supreme Court also provided two big lawyers to help the accused lawyers of justice
 raju ramchandran or sanjay hegade
 Both of them questioned a lot about the investigation of Delhi Police and the decision of Delhi High Court
 yani har sawaal ko mauka mila
 The Delhi Police's investigation into the final verdict has been praised
 nirbhaya kii maa kaa naam aashaa he

 bilkis baanon jaisi auraton or saikadon anaam dalit ladakiyon ke saath hone vaale balaatkaar ke maamle main jis din bharat kii mahilayen raisina pahunch jaaengi us din auraton kii ladaai auraton kii ban jaaegi
 Strict laws and strict punishment affect the crime
 padataa to dilli main har din balaatkaar ke chah maamle darj nahin hote
 According to the National Crime Records Bureau, 33,707 rape cases were registered in 2013
 2014 main balaatkaar ke 36,735 maamle darj hue
 In 2015, 34,651 cases of rape were reported
 is puure maamle ko hamaare sahyogi ashish bhargav ne kaaphi zimmedaari ke saath cover kiya he
 Ashish is not as fortunate as the reporters or anchors whose photo appears on the hoarding, but every report of this reporter teaches us something in the news
 ashish ne bataaya ki teen jajon kii bench special bench thi
 There is also a law to sit on this bench
 bench ke pramukh justise deepak mishra bich main baithte hai
 On his right was Junior Justice r Bhanumati seated with him
 justise mishra ke baayin or justise ashok bhushan baithe the jo in teenon main sabase junior hai
 The bench has held hearings on Monday, Friday and Saturday for one year
 44 se zyaada hearing hui hai
 Rather, in the case of mitigating factor, there was a second hearing from March 6, that is, the question on which the matter reached the Supreme Court was heard twice in a year
 jajon ne koi jaldbaazi nahin dikhaai
 The Supreme Court also provided two big lawyers to help the accused lawyers of justice
 raju ramchandran or sanjay hegade
 Both of them questioned a lot about the investigation of Delhi Police and the decision of Delhi High Court
 yani har sawaal ko mauka mila
 The Delhi Police's investigation into the final verdict has been praised
 ye shabdash: anuwaad nahin he
 Justice Mishra's English is also good and Nafees
 isliye kuch galati ho sakati he
 But only this part of the Judgment can spark a long debate on the frustrations of Indian society
 ham sirf samuhik chetana tak hi khud ko simit rakhte hue kuch kahana chaahate hai
 Keep in mind one thing, the decision has not been taken on the basis of or for collective consciousness
 aisa samajhnaa faisle ke mahatv ko kam karnaa hoga magar zikr he or kai log ise galat samaj sakate hai isliye yahaan bilkis baanon kaa prasang laana chahta hum
 On May 4, the Bombay High Court delivered a verdict in the Bilkis Ban case related to the Gujarat riots
 is maamle main 12 logon ko umr kaid kii sazaa sunai gai, iske alaava paanch police afasar or do doctor bhi sabooton ko mitaane ke maamle main doshi paae gaye
 That is, the general public as well as members of the state were also involved in the violence against the Bilkis Ban
 bombai hai court ne is maamle main sibiai kii daleel ko sahi mana
 For 19 years, Bilkis Ban has been fighting for his justice, but is there any collective consciousness with Bilkis
 isiilie samuhik chetana jaise shabd kii samiksha zaruri he
 Did the collective consciousness distract that 19-year-old Bilkis was raped when she was pregnant
 kya samuhik chetana vichlit hui jab uski bacchee ko usase chhina gaya or ek pathar par sir patakar kar maar diya gaya
 Did collective consciousness awaken when Bilkis was raped along with his mother and sister
 kya samuhik chetana us vakt sadakon par utari thi jab bilkis kii beti or uske parivaar ke 14 log maar diye gaye the
 Bilkis did not say that he would agree on being hanged, yet the reactions of Saleha's mother Bilkis and Nirbhaya's mother Asha ji are quite significant
 bilkis ne saavdhaan kiya he ki ham dharmon ke naam par is tarah apane hosh na ganvaa baithen
 He bharatvasiyon gujaratvaasiyon ko shukriya kaha he
 Many people may be thinking that what happened to Bilkis was the collective consciousness after Godhra
 aap sikh bhaaiyon se puuchhiye 84 kii dilli main sadakon par koun si samuhik chetana thi
 Therefore, one should be alert from collective consciousness
 har samuhik chetana acchhee nahin hoti he
 After hearing for a year, a three-judge bench headed by Justice Deepak Mishra has given the verdict
 abhiyukton ko puraa mauka diya gaya apana paksh rakhane kaa
 a cursory reading showed that Justice Mishra had written the verdict very carefully and cautiously
 kai rajyon main is tarah ke maamalon main jo faisle hue hai, unka udhaaharan diya he
 The cases of Rajasthan, Bihar, Maharashtra, UP, Jammu Kashmir, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh were mentioned in the judgment as a reference
 yah baat thik he ki raisina hills par pahunchi ladkiyaan sirf bheed nahin thim
 They cannot be dismissed as a crowd
 is bheed main bahut si ladkiyaan apane jivan main pehali baar kisi mudde ke liye ghar se nikali thim
 She did not come as a mob to kill anyone but was awakening the Constitution and the law
 samuhik chetana ke naam par raisina par ain ladakiyon kii bheed ko riject karnaa galati hogi
 You cannot compare this mob to the mob that kills Ghulam Mohammad in Bulandshahr on the charge of loving a Hindu girl, who kills Kishor Khan in the name of cow protection in Alwar
 raisina par jamaa hui ladakiyon ke haath main jo binar the, wo behatar or sanvaidhanik samaaj ke sapane dekh rahe the
 This decision is historic
 yah ghatana vaaki bhayanak thi
 So terrible that even today, while referring to his episodes, shuddering arises
 justise mishra ne apane faisle kii shuruuaat is tarah se karte hai
 
 
 
 16 disambar 2012 kii dilli kii sard bhari shaam ne apane saathi ke saath piviar salect city main film dekhne gai 23 saal kii ladki ko zaraa bhi bhanak nahin di hogi ki agle kuch ghanton main, tej hoti kanpakapaahat bhari raat uski zindagi main ek bhayanak andhera laane vaali he
 When she will board the bus with her friend from Munirka bus stand
 usne sochaa bhi nahin hoga ki wo chah logon ke gang kii havas kaa shikaar hone ja rahi he, usapar jaanaleva hamalaa hoga, wo unke liye mouj masti kaa zariyaa ban jaaegi or nijee angon ko chhin bhinn kar diya jayega, ek aisi bhukh ke liye jiske bare main kisi ne sochaa nahin hoga
 Literally not a translation, but the way Judge Sahiban started writing, the first two to three paragraphs of the verdict get heavy
 padhaa nahin jaataa he
 The accused wanted that if the execution of the sentence is being done, then every aspect should be properly heard
 supreme court ne unhen puraa mauka diya
 The counsel for the accused was concerned that the FIR was delayed
 matlab saboot ke saath chhedchhad hui he lekin hameshaa yah baat sahi nahin hoti he
 There has been a long debate on the question of delay in the FIR
 faisle kaa padhenge to kam se kam sattar pannon tak yahi bahes chal rahi he
 The court has written in its judgment that doubting the delay depends on several reasons
 haalanki lambii deree bhi maaf kii ja sakati he agar peedit ke paas motive nahin he abhiyukt ko fansaane kaa
 In this case, the victims were admitted to the hospital at 11:05 pm
 3:45 par peedit ladke kaa bayaan record kiya gaya
 Initially the priority is to provide medical assistance to the victims
 agar maan bhi liya jaae ki deree hui to ye bilkul maanviya he
 Another question was that the names of the accused in the FIR and Medico legal case were not registered, then the court said that the FIR is not an encyclopedia
 peedit se ummid nahin kii jaati ki wo ghatana kii puri jaankaree exiaar main hi de
 In this way, one question has been heard
 epa ai aar main deree kii tarah daaing diclaration ko lekar bhi sawaal uthaa, is par bhi lambii bahes chali he magar court ne apane faisle main kaha ki hamen yah maanane main koi dikkt nahin he ki haav-bhav, ishaare se koi daaing dicleration darj hota he, use sakshya ke taur par manyata di ja sakati he
 Provided that due care has been taken while recording the statement
 hamaare record par jo sakshya uplabdh hai uske aadhaar par sabhi teenon daaing dicleration main ek tarah kii nirantarata dikhti he yani teenon main kaaphi mail he, or anya saakshyon ke saath unka milan bhi hota he
 Therefore, the trial court, the High Court has considered the basis of Dyeing Declaration in sentencing
 faisle kaa anuwaad ek mushkil kaam he
 Nevertheless, this decision will make us more literate than all the debate because the judges have written deeply on all aspects
 bahuton ko lag saktaa he ki yah faisla faansee ke faislon ko badhaava dene vaala he to aisa sochna jaldbaazi hogi
 Rather, on the 402 number page, Justice Mishra and Justice Bhushan write that whether the case is the rarest of rare or not, the process of execution in India has developed a lot due to many policy reforms and judicial decisions, it shows that hanging What has been our view at different times about the punishment, of course, the possibilities of improvement in punishment are ahead and India's international responsibility is also reflected Persons sentenced to death has changed the attitude of the courts
 bharat main faansee kii sazaa kaa shater band hone kii taraf bad rahaa he lekin reerest of rer maamle main ek choti si khidki khuli hui he
 If the correct translation is done, this part shows that the court is not blind to the execution of the sentence
 wo is disha main tamaam sabooton or tarkon ke aadhaar par bad rahi he
 Used a small window that is open
 isliye ek insaaf yah bhi he ki faisle ko padhaa jaae
 Justice r Bhanumathi's comment is also important in this judgment
 wo likhti hai, mahaan vidwaan vivekanand ke shabdon main kisi bhi raashtra kii pragati kaa sabase acha tharmametre yah he ki vah auraton ke saath kya saluk karata he
 Crime against women not only hurts their self-esteem but also stops the development of society
 main ummid karti hum ki rajdhani main hui is jaghanya ghatana or ek noujvaan ladki kii maut se ek janandolan ubharegaa jo ek mahilaon ke khilaaf hinsa ko khatm karegaa
 Comments aamtaur par jajon ke faisle main shakespeare, vardsaworth, yeats ko hi kot kiya jaataa he, bahut dinon baad dekha ki vivekanand ko kot kiya gaya he
 this is fine
 balaatkaar ke khilaaf yah ladaai lambii he
 The collective consciousness of the Nirbhaya case is often silenced in those cases which have been victimizing the weaker sections of society away from Delhi
 bilkis baanon jaisi auraton or saikadon anaam dalit ladakiyon ke saath hone vaale balaatkaar ke maamle main jis din bharat kii mahilayen raisina pahunch jaaengi us din auraton kii ladaai auraton kii ban jaaegi
 Strict laws and strict punishment affect the crime
 padataa to dilli main har din balaatkaar ke chah maamle darj nahin hote
 According to the National Crime Records Bureau, 33,707 rape cases were registered in 2013
 2014 main balaatkaar ke 36,735 maamle darj hue
 In 2015, 34,651 cases of rape were reported
 is puure maamle ko hamaare sahyogi ashish bhargav ne kaaphi zimmedaari ke saath cover kiya he
 Ashish is not as fortunate as the reporters or anchors whose photo appears on the hoarding, but every report of this reporter teaches us something in the news
 ashish ne bataaya ki teen jajon kii bench special bench thi
 There is also a law to sit on this bench
 bench ke pramukh justise deepak mishra bich main baithte hai
 On his right was Junior Justice r Bhanumati seated with him
 justise mishra ke baayin or justise ashok bhushan baithe the jo in teenon main sabase junior hai
 The bench has held hearings on Monday, Friday and Saturday for one year
 44 se zyaada hearing hui hai
 Rather, in the case of mitigating factor, there was a second hearing from March 6, that is, the question on which the matter reached the Supreme Court was heard twice in a year
 jajon ne koi jaldbaazi nahin dikhaai
 The Supreme Court also provided two big lawyers to help the accused lawyers of justice
 raju ramchandran or sanjay hegade
 Both of them questioned a lot about the investigation of Delhi Police and the decision of Delhi High Court
 yani har sawaal ko mauka mila
 The Delhi Police's investigation into the final verdict has been praised
 yani aam janata ke saath-saath state yani rajya ke sadsy bhi bilkis baanon ke khilaaf hui hinsa main shaamil the
 The Bombay High Court upheld the cbi's plea in the case
 19 saal se bilkis baanon apane insaaf kii ladaai lard rahi he lekin kya bilkis ke saath koi samuhik chetana he
 That is why it is important to review a word like collective consciousness
 kya samuhik chetana is baat se vichlit hui ki 19 saal kii bilkis ke saath balaatkaar tab hua jab vah garbhvatee thi
 Was the collective consciousness disturbed when her child was snatched from her and beheaded on a stone
 kya samuhik chetana us samay jaagi jab bilkis kii maa or bahan ke saath rape kiya gaya
 Did collective consciousness hit the streets when Bilkis' daughter and 14 of her family were killed
 bilkis ne yah nahin kaha ki faansee se kam par maanenge phir bhi saaleha kii maa bilkis or nirbhaya kii maa aashaa ji kii pratikriyaayein kaaphi mahatvapurn hai
 Bilkis has cautioned that we should not lose our senses in the name of religions
 usne The people of India have thanked the people of Gujarat
 bahut se log soch rahe honge ki bilkis ke saath jo hua wo godhra ke baad kii samuhik chetana thi
 Ask the Sikh brothers what was the collective consciousness of 84 in the streets of Delhi
 isliye samuhik chetana se satark rahanaa chahie
 Not every collective consciousness is good
 ek saal tak sunne ke baad justise deepak mishra kii adhyakshata main teen jajon kii bench ne faisla diya he
 The accused were given full opportunity to present their case
 sarsari taur par padhate hue laga ki justise mishra ne kaaphi saavdhaanee or satarkta se faisla likhaa he
 Many states have given examples of decisions taken in such cases
 rajasthan, bihar, maharashtra, upi, jammu kashmir, andhra pradesh, madhyapradesh ke maamalon kaa zikr faisle main sandarbh ke taur par dikhaa
 It is true that the girls who reached Raisina Hills were not just crowded
 inhen bheed kahkar khaarij nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Many of the girls in this crowd had left home for the first time in their lives for an issue
 wo bheed banakar kisi ko maarane nahin ai thim balki samvidhan or kanoon ko jagaa rahi thim
 It would be a mistake to reject the crowd of girls who came to Raisina in the name of collective consciousness
 is bheed kii tulana aap us bheed se nahin kar sakate jo bulandshahr main gulam mohammad ko hindu ladki se prem karne ke aarope main maar detii he, jo alvar main gau raksha ke naam par pahalu khan ko maar detii he
 The banners held in the hands of the girls gathered on Raisina, they were dreaming of a better and constitutional society
 yah faisla aitihaasik he
 This incident was really terrible
 itani bhayanak ki aaj bhi uske prasangon kaa zikr karte hue siharan paidaa ho jaati he
 Justice Mishra begins his decision in this way
 
 
 
 The chilly evening of 16 December 2012 in Delhi, along with her partner in the PVR Select City, would not have given the 23-year-old girl any inkling that in the next few hours, a booming night would bring a terrible darkness to her life
 Is supposed to jab wo muniraka bas stand se apane dost ke saath bas main savaar hogi
 She would not have imagined that she was going to fall prey to the lust of a gang of six people, she would be subjected to a murderous attack, it would become a source of fun for them and her personal organs would be severed, for a hunger Nobody would have thought about that
 shabdash: anuwaad nahin he, magar jaj sahiban ne jis tarah se likhnaa shuru kiya he, faisle ke pehle do teen paragraph se hi man baari ho jaataa he
 Is not read
 aaropee chaahate the ki faansee kii sazaa ho rahi he to har pahalu par thik se sunwaayee ho jaae
 The Supreme Court gave him full opportunity
 aropiyon ke vakil kaa sawaal tha ki exiaar main deree hui
 Meaning the evidence has been tampered with but this is not always true
 exiaar main deree ke sawaal par hi lambii bahes chali he
 If you read the verdict, this debate is going on for at least seventy pages
 court ne apane faisle main likhaa he ki deree par shaq karnaa kai vajahon par nirbhar karata he
 However long delays can also be forgiven if the victim does not have motive to implicate the accused
 is cese main peediton ko 11:05 par aspataal main bharti karaayaa gaya
 The statement of the victim boy was recorded at 3:45
 shuruyaat main praathamikta peediton ko medical sahaayta dene kii hoti he
 Even if it is to be delayed, it is absolutely human
 ek doosraa sawaal tha ki exiaar or medico legal cese main aropiyon ke naam darj nahin the to court ne kaha ki exiaar koi encychlopedia nahin hoti he
 The victim is not expected to give complete information about the incident in the FIR itself
 is tarah se ek ek sawaal par sunwaayee hui he
 Like the delay in the FIR, there was a long debate on dyeing declaration as well, but the court said in its judgment that we have no right to believe that any gesture would have been recorded by gesture, gesture Yes, it can be recognized as evidence
 basharte bayaan darj karte vakt puri saavdhaanee barti gai ho
 On the basis of the evidence available on our records, there is a kind of consistency in all the three dyeing declarations i
e
 all three are quite similar, and they are also matched with other evidence
 isliye trial court, hoicourt ne sazaa dene main daaing dicleration ko jo aadhaar mana he, wo sahi he
 Translation of judgment is a difficult task
 phir bhi tamaam bahes se zyada yah faisla hamen sakshar karegaa kyonki jajon ne tamaam pahaluon par gaharaai se likhaa he
 Many may feel that this decision is going to promote the decisions of hanging, so it is too early to think
 balki 402 number pej par justise mishra or justise bhushan likhte hai ki yah cese reerest of rer he yaa nahin, bharat main faansee kii sazaa kii prakriya kai nitigat sudhaaron or nyaayik faislon ke kaaran ab kaaphi viksit ho chuki he, isse pataa chalata he ki faansee kii sazaa ko lekar alag-alag samay main hamaara kya nazariyaa rahaa he, beshak sazaa dene main sudhaar kii sambhaavnaaon kaa paksh aage rahata he or bharat kaa antarrashtriya daayitv bhi jhalkata he ki faansee kii sazaa ko lekar adaalaton kaa nazariyaa badla he
 In India, the death penalty shutter is moving towards closure, but in the case of rarest of rare, a small window is open
 agar sahi anuwaad hua he to yah hissaa bataata he ki adaalat faansee kii sazaa kii andh samarthak nahin he
 She is growing in this direction based on all the evidence and arguments
 choti si jo khidki khuli hui he uskaa istemaal kiya he
 Therefore, it is also a judgment that the verdict be read
 is faisle main justise aar bhaanumati kii tippanee bhi mahatvapurn he
 She writes, in the words of the great scholar Vivekananda, the best thermometer of the progress of any nation is what it treats women
 auraton ke kilaaf aparaadh se na sirf unka swabhimaan aahat hota he balki samaaj ke vikaas kii gati bhi ruk jaati he
 i hope that this heinous incident in the capital and the death of a young girl will lead to a mass movement that will end violence against women
 'tippaniyan Shakespeare, Wordsworth, Yeats are usually quoted in the judgment of the judges, seen long after that Vivekananda has been quoted
 ye thik he
 This fight against rape is long
 nirbhaya maamle kaa samuhik chetana aksar un maamalon main khamosh rah jaataa he jo dilli se dur samaaj ke kamazor tabake ko apana shikaar bana rahaa hota he
 In the case of rape of women such as Bilkis Ban and hundreds of unnamed Dalit girls, the day when the women of India reach Raisina, the fight for women will become women
 kade kanoon or sakht sazaa se aparaadh par kya asar padataa he
 If not, six cases of rape would not have been filed in Delhi every day
 rashtriya aparaadh ricard beuro ke anusaar 2013 main balaatkaar ke 33,707 maamle darj hue
 In 2014, there were 36,735 rape cases reported
 2015 main balaatkaar ke 34,651 maamle darj hue
 This entire matter has been covered with great responsibility by our colleague Ashish Bhargava
 ashish un samvaadadaataaon yaa ankaron jitne kismatwale nahin hai jinka photo hording par lagata he magar is samvaadadaata kii har report news main hamen kuch na kuch sikhaa jaati he
 Ashish said that the bench of three judges was a special bench
 is bench ke baithne kaa bhi ek kaayda hota he
 The head of the bench, Justice Deepak Mishra, sits in the middle
 unki daayin ore unase junior justise aar bhaanumati baithi thim
 To the left of Justice Mishra and Justice Ashok Bhushan was seated, who is the most junior of these three
 is bench ne ek saal tak somvaar, shuukravaar or shanivaar ko sunwaayee kii he
 There are more than 44 hearings
 balki mitegating factor vaale maamle main to 6 march se dobaaraa hearing hui yani jis sawaal ko lekar yah maamla supreme court pahunchaa tha us sawaal par ek saal main do baar sunwaayee hui
 The judges showed no haste
 insaaf kaa palada baari lage isliye aropiyon ke vakeelon kii madad ke liye supreme court ne do bade vakil bhi upabaldh karaaye
 Raju Ramachandran and Sanjay Hegde
 in donon ne dilli police kii jaanch or dilli hoicourt ke faisle par khub sawaal kiye
 That means every question got a chance
 final faisle main dilli police kii jaanch kii saraahna kii gai he
 Many people may be thinking that what happened to Bilkis was the collective consciousness after Godhra
 aap sikh bhaaiyon se puuchhiye 84 kii dilli main sadakon par koun si samuhik chetana thi
 Therefore, one should be alert from collective consciousness
 har samuhik chetana acchhee nahin hoti he
 After hearing for a year, a three-judge bench headed by Justice Deepak Mishra has given the verdict
 abhiyukton ko puraa mauka diya gaya apana paksh rakhane kaa
 a cursory reading showed that Justice Mishra had written the verdict very carefully and cautiously
 kai rajyon main is tarah ke maamalon main jo faisle hue hai, unka udhaaharan diya he
 The cases of Rajasthan, Bihar, Maharashtra, UP, Jammu Kashmir, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh were mentioned in the judgment as a reference
 yah baat thik he ki raisina hills par pahunchi ladkiyaan sirf bheed nahin thim
 They cannot be dismissed as a crowd
 is bheed main bahut si ladkiyaan apane jivan main pehali baar kisi mudde ke liye ghar se nikali thim

 When she will board the bus with her friend from Munirka bus stand

 this is fine
 balaatkaar ke khilaaf yah ladaai lambii he
 The collective consciousness of the Nirbhaya case is often silenced in those cases which have been victimizing the weaker sections of society away from Delhi
 bilkis baanon jaisi auraton or saikadon anaam dalit ladakiyon ke saath hone vaale balaatkaar ke maamle main jis din bharat kii mahilayen raisina pahunch jaaengi us din auraton kii ladaai auraton kii ban jaaegi
 Strict laws and strict punishment affect the crime
 padataa to dilli main har din balaatkaar ke chah maamle darj nahin hote
 According to the National Crime Records Bureau, 33,707 rape cases were registered in 2013
 2014 main balaatkaar ke 36,735 maamle darj hue
 In 2015, 34,651 cases of rape were reported

 Ashish is not as fortunate as the reporters or anchors whose photo appears on the hoarding, but every report of this reporter teaches us something in the news
 ashish ne bataaya ki teen jajon kii bench special bench thi
 There is also a law to sit on this bench

 On his right was Junior Justice r Bhanumati seated with him

 44 se zyaada hearing hui hai
 Rather, in the case of mitigating factor, there was a second hearing from March 6, that is, the question on which the matter reached the Supreme Court was heard twice in a year
 jajon ne koi jaldbaazi nahin dikhaai
 The Supreme Court also provided two big lawyers to help the accused lawyers of justice
 raju ramchandran or sanjay hegade
 Both of them questioned a lot about the investigation of Delhi Police and the decision of Delhi High Court
 yani har sawaal ko mauka mila
 The Delhi Police's investigation into the final verdict has been praised
 samuhik chetana ke naam par raisina par ain ladakiyon kii bheed ko riject karnaa galati hogi
 You cannot compare this mob to the mob that kills Ghulam Mohammad in Bulandshahr on the charge of loving a Hindu girl, who kills Kishor Khan in the name of cow protection in Alwar
 raisina par jamaa hui ladakiyon ke haath main jo binar the, wo behatar or sanvaidhanik samaaj ke sapane dekh rahe the
 This decision is historic
 yah ghatana vaaki bhayanak thi
 So terrible that even today, while referring to his episodes, shuddering arises
 justise mishra ne apane faisle kii shuruuaat is tarah se karte hai
 
 
 
 16 disambar 2012 kii dilli kii sard bhari shaam ne apane saathi ke saath piviar salect city main film dekhne gai 23 saal kii ladki ko zaraa bhi bhanak nahin di hogi ki agle kuch ghanton main, tej hoti kanpakapaahat bhari raat uski zindagi main ek bhayanak andhera laane vaali he
 When she will board the bus with her friend from Munirka bus stand
 usne sochaa bhi nahin hoga ki wo chah logon ke gang kii havas kaa shikaar hone ja rahi he, usapar jaanaleva hamalaa hoga, wo unke liye mouj masti kaa zariyaa ban jaaegi or nijee angon ko chhin bhinn kar diya jayega, ek aisi bhukh ke liye jiske bare main kisi ne sochaa nahin hoga
 Literally not a translation, but the way Judge Sahiban started writing, the first two to three paragraphs of the verdict get heavy
 padhaa nahin jaataa he
 The accused wanted that if the execution of the sentence is being done, then every aspect should be properly heard
 supreme court ne unhen puraa mauka diya
 The counsel for the accused was concerned that the FIR was delayed
 matlab saboot ke saath chhedchhad hui he lekin hameshaa yah baat sahi nahin hoti he
 There has been a long debate on the question of delay in the FIR
 faisle kaa padhenge to kam se kam sattar pannon tak yahi bahes chal rahi he
 The court has written in its judgment that doubting the delay depends on several reasons
 haalanki lambii deree bhi maaf kii ja sakati he agar peedit ke paas motive nahin he abhiyukt ko fansaane kaa
 In this case, the victims were admitted to the hospital at 11:05 pm
 3:45 par peedit ladke kaa bayaan record kiya gaya
 Initially the priority is to provide medical assistance to the victims
 agar maan bhi liya jaae ki deree hui to ye bilkul maanviya he
 Another question was that the names of the accused in the FIR and Medico legal case were not registered, then the court said that the FIR is not an encyclopedia
 peedit se ummid nahin kii jaati ki wo ghatana kii puri jaankaree exiaar main hi de
 In this way, one question has been heard
 epa ai aar main deree kii tarah daaing diclaration ko lekar bhi sawaal uthaa, is par bhi lambii bahes chali he magar court ne apane faisle main kaha ki hamen yah maanane main koi dikkt nahin he ki haav-bhav, ishaare se koi daaing dicleration darj hota he, use sakshya ke taur par manyata di ja sakati he
 Provided that due care has been taken while recording the statement
 hamaare record par jo sakshya uplabdh hai uske aadhaar par sabhi teenon daaing dicleration main ek tarah kii nirantarata dikhti he yani teenon main kaaphi mail he, or anya saakshyon ke saath unka milan bhi hota he
 Therefore, the trial court, the High Court has considered the basis of Dyeing Declaration in sentencing
 faisle kaa anuwaad ek mushkil kaam he
 Nevertheless, this decision will make us more literate than all the debate because the judges have written deeply on all aspects
 bahuton ko lag saktaa he ki yah faisla faansee ke faislon ko badhaava dene vaala he to aisa sochna jaldbaazi hogi
 Rather, on the 402 number page, Justice Mishra and Justice Bhushan write that whether the case is the rarest of rare or not, the process of execution in India has developed a lot due to many policy reforms and judicial decisions, it shows that hanging What has been our view at different times about the punishment, of course, the possibilities of improvement in punishment are ahead and India's international responsibility is also reflected Persons sentenced to death has changed the attitude of the courts
 bharat main faansee kii sazaa kaa shater band hone kii taraf bad rahaa he lekin reerest of rer maamle main ek choti si khidki khuli hui he
 If the correct translation is done, this part shows that the court is not blind to the execution of the sentence
 wo is disha main tamaam sabooton or tarkon ke aadhaar par bad rahi he
 Used a small window that is open
 isliye ek insaaf yah bhi he ki faisle ko padhaa jaae
 Justice r Bhanumathi's comment is also important in this judgment
 wo likhti hai, mahaan vidwaan vivekanand ke shabdon main kisi bhi raashtra kii pragati kaa sabase acha tharmametre yah he ki vah auraton ke saath kya saluk karata he
 Crime against women not only hurts their self-esteem but also stops the development of society
 main ummid karti hum ki rajdhani main hui is jaghanya ghatana or ek noujvaan ladki kii maut se ek janandolan ubharegaa jo ek mahilaon ke khilaaf hinsa ko khatm karegaa
 Comments aamtaur par jajon ke faisle main shakespeare, vardsaworth, yeats ko hi kot kiya jaataa he, bahut dinon baad dekha ki vivekanand ko kot kiya gaya he
 this is fine
 balaatkaar ke khilaaf yah ladaai lambii he
 The collective consciousness of the Nirbhaya case is often silenced in those cases which have been victimizing the weaker sections of society away from Delhi
 bilkis baanon jaisi auraton or saikadon anaam dalit ladakiyon ke saath hone vaale balaatkaar ke maamle main jis din bharat kii mahilayen raisina pahunch jaaengi us din auraton kii ladaai auraton kii ban jaaegi
 Strict laws and strict punishment affect the crime
 padataa to dilli main har din balaatkaar ke chah maamle darj nahin hote
 According to the National Crime Records Bureau, 33,707 rape cases were registered in 2013
 2014 main balaatkaar ke 36,735 maamle darj hue
 In 2015, 34,651 cases of rape were reported
 is puure maamle ko hamaare sahyogi ashish bhargav ne kaaphi zimmedaari ke saath cover kiya he
 Ashish is not as fortunate as the reporters or anchors whose photo appears on the hoarding, but every report of this reporter teaches us something in the news
 ashish ne bataaya ki teen jajon kii bench special bench thi
 There is also a law to sit on this bench
 bench ke pramukh justise deepak mishra bich main baithte hai
 On his right was Junior Justice r Bhanumati seated with him
 justise mishra ke baayin or justise ashok bhushan baithe the jo in teenon main sabase junior hai
 The bench has held hearings on Monday, Friday and Saturday for one year
 44 se zyaada hearing hui hai
 Rather, in the case of mitigating factor, there was a second hearing from March 6, that is, the question on which the matter reached the Supreme Court was heard twice in a year
 jajon ne koi jaldbaazi nahin dikhaai
 The Supreme Court also provided two big lawyers to help the accused lawyers of justice
 raju ramchandran or sanjay hegade
 Both of them questioned a lot about the investigation of Delhi Police and the decision of Delhi High Court
 yani har sawaal ko mauka mila
 The Delhi Police's investigation into the final verdict has been praised
 yah faisla aitihaasik he
 This incident was really terrible
 itani bhayanak ki aaj bhi uske prasangon kaa zikr karte hue siharan paidaa ho jaati he
 Justice Mishra begins his decision in this way
 
 
 
 The chilly evening of 16 December 2012 in Delhi, along with her partner in the PVR Select City, would not have given the 23-year-old girl any inkling that in the next few hours, a booming night would bring a terrible darkness to her life
 Is supposed to jab wo muniraka bas stand se apane dost ke saath bas main savaar hogi
 She would not have imagined that she was going to fall prey to the lust of a gang of six people, she would be subjected to a murderous attack, it would become a source of fun for them and her personal organs would be severed, for a hunger Nobody would have thought about that
 shabdash: anuwaad nahin he, magar jaj sahiban ne jis tarah se likhnaa shuru kiya he, faisle ke pehle do teen paragraph se hi man baari ho jaataa he
 Is not read
 aaropee chaahate the ki faansee kii sazaa ho rahi he to har pahalu par thik se sunwaayee ho jaae
 The Supreme Court gave him full opportunity
 aropiyon ke vakil kaa sawaal tha ki exiaar main deree hui
 Meaning the evidence has been tampered with but this is not always true
 exiaar main deree ke sawaal par hi lambii bahes chali he
 If you read the verdict, this debate is going on for at least seventy pages
 court ne apane faisle main likhaa he ki deree par shaq karnaa kai vajahon par nirbhar karata he
 However long delays can also be forgiven if the victim does not have motive to implicate the accused
 is cese main peediton ko 11:05 par aspataal main bharti karaayaa gaya
 The statement of the victim boy was recorded at 3:45
 shuruyaat main praathamikta peediton ko medical sahaayta dene kii hoti he
 Even if it is to be delayed, it is absolutely human
 ek doosraa sawaal tha ki exiaar or medico legal cese main aropiyon ke naam darj nahin the to court ne kaha ki exiaar koi encychlopedia nahin hoti he
 The victim is not expected to give complete information about the incident in the FIR itself
 is tarah se ek ek sawaal par sunwaayee hui he
 Like the delay in the FIR, there was a long debate on dyeing declaration as well, but the court said in its judgment that we have no right to believe that any gesture would have been recorded by gesture, gesture Yes, it can be recognized as evidence
 basharte bayaan darj karte vakt puri saavdhaanee barti gai ho
 On the basis of the evidence available on our records, there is a kind of consistency in all the three dyeing declarations i
e
 all three are quite similar, and they are also matched with other evidence
 isliye trial court, hoicourt ne sazaa dene main daaing dicleration ko jo aadhaar mana he, wo sahi he
 Translation of judgment is a difficult task
 phir bhi tamaam bahes se zyada yah faisla hamen sakshar karegaa kyonki jajon ne tamaam pahaluon par gaharaai se likhaa he
 Many may feel that this decision is going to promote the decisions of hanging, so it is too early to think
 balki 402 number pej par justise mishra or justise bhushan likhte hai ki yah cese reerest of rer he yaa nahin, bharat main faansee kii sazaa kii prakriya kai nitigat sudhaaron or nyaayik faislon ke kaaran ab kaaphi viksit ho chuki he, isse pataa chalata he ki faansee kii sazaa ko lekar alag-alag samay main hamaara kya nazariyaa rahaa he, beshak sazaa dene main sudhaar kii sambhaavnaaon kaa paksh aage rahata he or bharat kaa antarrashtriya daayitv bhi jhalkata he ki faansee kii sazaa ko lekar adaalaton kaa nazariyaa badla he
 In India, the death penalty shutter is moving towards closure, but in the case of rarest of rare, a small window is open
 agar sahi anuwaad hua he to yah hissaa bataata he ki adaalat faansee kii sazaa kii andh samarthak nahin he
 She is growing in this direction based on all the evidence and arguments
 choti si jo khidki khuli hui he uskaa istemaal kiya he
 Therefore, it is also a judgment that the verdict be read
 is faisle main justise aar bhaanumati kii tippanee bhi mahatvapurn he
 She writes, in the words of the great scholar Vivekananda, the best thermometer of the progress of any nation is what it treats women
 auraton ke kilaaf aparaadh se na sirf unka swabhimaan aahat hota he balki samaaj ke vikaas kii gati bhi ruk jaati he
 i hope that this heinous incident in the capital and the death of a young girl will lead to a mass movement that will end violence against women
 'tippaniyan Shakespeare, Wordsworth, Yeats are usually quoted in the judgment of the judges, seen long after that Vivekananda has been quoted
 ye thik he
 This fight against rape is long
 nirbhaya maamle kaa samuhik chetana aksar un maamalon main khamosh rah jaataa he jo dilli se dur samaaj ke kamazor tabake ko apana shikaar bana rahaa hota he
 In the case of rape of women such as Bilkis Ban and hundreds of unnamed Dalit girls, the day when the women of India reach Raisina, the fight for women will become women
 kade kanoon or sakht sazaa se aparaadh par kya asar padataa he
 If not, six cases of rape would not have been filed in Delhi every day
 rashtriya aparaadh ricard beuro ke anusaar 2013 main balaatkaar ke 33,707 maamle darj hue
 In 2014, there were 36,735 rape cases reported
 2015 main balaatkaar ke 34,651 maamle darj hue
 This entire matter has been covered with great responsibility by our colleague Ashish Bhargava
 ashish un samvaadadaataaon yaa ankaron jitne kismatwale nahin hai jinka photo hording par lagata he magar is samvaadadaata kii har report news main hamen kuch na kuch sikhaa jaati he
 Ashish said that the bench of three judges was a special bench
 is bench ke baithne kaa bhi ek kaayda hota he
 The head of the bench, Justice Deepak Mishra, sits in the middle
 unki daayin ore unase junior justise aar bhaanumati baithi thim
 To the left of Justice Mishra and Justice Ashok Bhushan was seated, who is the most junior of these three
 is bench ne ek saal tak somvaar, shuukravaar or shanivaar ko sunwaayee kii he
 There are more than 44 hearings
 balki mitegating factor vaale maamle main to 6 march se dobaaraa hearing hui yani jis sawaal ko lekar yah maamla supreme court pahunchaa tha us sawaal par ek saal main do baar sunwaayee hui
 The judges showed no haste
 insaaf kaa palada baari lage isliye aropiyon ke vakeelon kii madad ke liye supreme court ne do bade vakil bhi upabaldh karaaye
 Raju Ramachandran and Sanjay Hegde
 in donon ne dilli police kii jaanch or dilli hoicourt ke faisle par khub sawaal kiye
 That means every question got a chance
 final faisle main dilli police kii jaanch kii saraahna kii gai he

 congress ke rashtriya mahasachiv rahul gandhi ne uttarakhand main bhartiya janata party par apane hamale ko or adhik tej karte huye kaha ki bhaajapa aaj apane vigyapanon main kah rahi he ‘khanduri hai jaruri’, vah poochna chaahate hai ki aaj se teen maheene pehle tak kya khanduri jaruri nahin the
 Was corruption necessary before that? Rahul was addressing election meetings in Pithoragarh and Kaladhungi in Uttarakhand
 unhone kaha ki khanduri isaliye ab jaruri ho gayi hai, kyonki bhaajapa ke kiye gayi bhrashtachar par pardaa daalana he
 He said, 'why did the BJP not remember corruption when it was in power at the Center and corruption was taking place on corruption
 us samay unke netaa laalkrishna adwani ne bhrashtachar ke khilaaf kyon nahin rathyatra nikaali
 At that time, he used to sit in his room and watch TV
 ’congress mahasachiv ne apane joshilay andaaj main poocha ki bhaajapa ko uttarakhand, karnataka, chhattisgarh, madhyapradesh, gujarat rajyon main bhrashtachar kyon nahin dikhaai detaa he
 Advani should be asked what he had told people about corruption in Karnataka during his rath yatra
 yadi nahin kiya to kyon nahin kiya tha?unhone kaha ki bhrashtachar kisi jaadu kii chadi se khatm nahin hoga balki ise aahiste aahiste khatm karnaa hoga
 Rahul Gandhi said that when the Congress government at the Center starts schemes for the welfare of the poor, farmers and laborers, the BJP leaders start saying that the money is being wasted
 unhone kaha, ‘main poochna chahta hum ki kya is desh kii aam janata ke liye vikaas yojanayen shuru kar paise ko barabaad kiya jaataa he
 We waived 60 thousand crore rupees loans of farmers, made the administration transparent under Right to Information, guaranteed employment to the unemployed under Mahatmagandhi Rural Employment Guarantee Act, was this money wasted? ’unhone kaha, ‘ham puure hindustan ko bhojan kaa adhikaar dene vaale hai
 An Act will be made soon for this
 ham janata kaa paisa janata se poochkar kharch karte hai
 Money belongs to the general public in this country
 congress yaa bhaajapa kaa paisa nahin he
 Your future money is spent on you
 paisa aasmaan se nahin tapakataa he
 This is the money to sweat the blood of the general public
 ’rahul gandhi ne kaha ki uttarakhand main bhaajapa ko khanduri ke pehle bhrashtachar kyon nahin dikhaai diya tha, jo aaj khanduri itane jaruri ho gayi hai
 Khanduri is not necessary in Uttarakhand but development and progress are necessary
 congress mahasachiv ne bhrashtachar ke mudde par bhaajapa kii kadi aalochana karte huye kaha ki puure desh kaa sapana tha ki chunaav ayog kii tarj par ek swatantra lokapal kaa gathan kiya jaye taaki uske kaamkaaj main kisi prakaar kaa dakhal nahin ho
 Rahul Gandhi said that the way the Election Commission conducts elections in a fair and free manner and no one can interfere in its work
 isi tarah se lokapal bhi swatantra or nishpaksh tareeke se kaam kare, aisi soch na keval unke party kii thi balki puure desh kii thi
 He alleged, 'the Bharatiya Janata Party, due to its dogma, pressed the red button against him in Parliament
 ek sanvaidhanik lokapal ko maar diya
 It was not just our dream but the dream of the whole country
 ’unhone kaha, ‘is desh se bhrashtachar us samay samaapt hoga jab aam aadmi raajnneeti main sakriy rup se aayegaa
 We are trying to change the political system
 iske liye hamen lambii ladaai ladani hogi
 We are dreaming when every citizen is happy with the political system of the country
 ’ rahul gandhi ne logon se apil kii ki jo log teen maheene pehle tak uttarakhand main bhrashtachar kii baat nahin kar rahe the unase kahiye ki ve vikaas kii baat karen
 He said that the Congress has made the youth a candidate in this election and has specifically instructed the youth that under no circumstances corruption will be tolerated at any level
 yadi koi bhi bhrashtachar main lipt paaya gaya to vah uskaa karier hi samaapt kar denge

 pehle usne bharat main sabase zyada kamai karne vaali film da jangal book di jo 3di main thi ab vah superhiro kii film 'captain americah civil war' lekar aayaa he, or yah bhi 3di main he
 There is a new trend going on in Hollywood anyway, and that is a lot of superheroes
 pehle 'avengers' or ab 'captain america
 'batman vs Superman: Dawn of Justice', released a few days ago, featured two superheroes, and now in 'captain America: Civil War', our superheroes have split into two factions, but their aim of saving the world remains intact
 is
 'captain america'kii kahani kaa ek base he or maarval kii pichhali film 'avengersah aij of ultron' se kahani kaa conection bhi he
 It is said that one mistake is enough to wash hundred good works
 aisa hi kuch superhiroj ke saath bhi hota he
 The superheroes suffer damage and all the fingers start moving towards them
 superhiroj ko lekar javabdehi tay karne kaa rajnatik pressure badhane lagata he

 phir ek faisla liya jaataa he, jis parcaptain americaraji nahin hota he jabaki ultrons kii vajah se pachhataave kii aag main jal rahaa irman tony stark ko is par koi aapatti nahin hoti he

 The script is very tight and the story runs fast, exactly like superheroes that quickly move from place to place
 film ke ection seen hairat main daalane vaale hai, or viefex or technology ke kamaal se daanton tale ungali dabaane ko majaboor kar dete hai
