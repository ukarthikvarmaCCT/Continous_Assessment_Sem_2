 Premium charges apply !! team india ke captain mahendra singh dhoni ne zimbabwe ke khilaaf pehle tii20 mukaable main haar ke baad kaha ki unhen ummid he yuva cricketer is haar ke baad apni galatiyon se sikh lenge
 The young Indian team, who had lost their wickets on the crucial occasion, had to face defeat in this match by two runs
 dhoni ne kaha, ‘antarrashtriya cricket ipel se alag he
 There is not a lot of pressure in the IPL, there you can play big shots
 agar aap 14 main paanch yaa chah match khelte hai to bhi aap apni team ko aage le ja sakate hai
 But a little different here
 yahaan unhen vyaktigat rup se bataanaa hota he ki kis maukey par kya karnaa he
 And yes, that's how you learn
 yah jaruri nahin he ki seekhney ke liye galati kii jaae
 At the same time, Dhoni also said that the result of the match proves that all international teams should be respected
 ‘seekhney kaa mauka he, basharte sikh len’mahendra singh dhoni ko ummid he ki yuva khilaadi is maidan main hone vaale duusare match main ye galtiyaan nahin doharaaenge
 He said, 'I think we may have lost the match, which is disappointing, but it is an opportunity for the youth to learn it, provided they learn from it
 ’ dhoni ne kaha, ‘aapako ise gambhirtha se lenaa hoga kyonki jab bhi aap desh kaa pratinidhitiv karte ho, jab bhi aapako lagaataar kuch samay bhartiya team kaa hissaa hone kaa mauka miltaa he to kuch dabaav mahasoos hota he
 And at such times such visits would really help them to reduce the pressure
 ’antim gend par chaukaa maarane main naakaam rahe dhonicaptain khud apni team ko jeet nahin dilaa sake jisase bhartiya team antim over main aath ran nahin bana saki jisamen tej gendbaaj neville madjiva ne kasi gendbaaji kii
 He said that he should have finished the task of winning this match but he expected more sense from his batsmen
 dhoni ne kaha, ‘mujhe lagata he ki ballebaajon ko jimmedaari leni chahie
 The reason is that some batsmen were batting well at the crease and were frozen
 jab aap lakshya kaa peechha kar rahe hote ho to aapako ise ant tak le janaa chahie or phir shot khilne kii koshish kerani chahie
 This match was lacking in this match
 ’‘dhoni ne kaha, yah tour mere liye nahin’daure ke liye duusare darje kii team chuni gai thi jisamen kai senior khilaadi anupasthit hai or dhoni ne kaha ki ubharate hue khilaadiyon ko is maukey kaa puraa phayda uthaanaa chahie
 The captain said that he played at number six so that other players would get a chance to spend time at the crease
 unhone kaha, ‘yah mere liye nahin he
 If i had to bat in the above order, i could easily bat at number four for this team
 lekin in yuvaaon ke liye yah mahatvapurn he ki ve is number par ballebaaji karen kyonki yah unke liye badhiya mauka he
 i am here only to understand them as well as to tell them what should be done

 Significantly, the selection of Yogi, who was the chief priest of the Gorakhdham temple, was surprising to many
 haalanki yogi kii chhavi rajya main hindutv ke poster bvaay ke rup main ban chuki thi
 At the same time, the announcement of his name for the post of CM was also surprising because he had no experience of administration
 lekin unke naam kii ghoshnaa is pad par kiye jane kii vajah kaa khulaasa karte hue amit shah ne kaha, 'kisi ne sochaa bhi nahin tha ki yogi mukhyamantri banenge
 Many people told me that Yogi does not even have the experience of running a municipal corporation, why are you making him CM
 haa yah sahi he ki unako nagar nigam chalaane kaa bhi anubhav nahin tha
 He was the head of a temple
 'lakhanu main ek kaarykram ke dauraan siem yogi adityanath kii maujuudagi main amit shah ne aage kaha, ' logon ne mujhase kaha aap unako itane bade rajya kii kaman kyon saunp rahe hai
 But PM Modi and i decided to make him CM
 kyonki vah karmath hai or unhone apane kam anubhav ko kathor parishram se kabhi baadha nahin banane diya
 Let us tell you that in the year 2017, BJP got a strong majority in Uttar Pradesh

 Elections are going to be held in Uttar Pradesh in a few months, and at the top level in the ruling Samajwadi Party (between party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav and his chief minister son Akhilesh Yadav), there has been a long infighting
 bollywood abhinayta se netaa bane raaj babbar is samay congress kii rajya ikai ke pramukh hai, lekin maamle ko jatil banaata he unka rajnatik itihaas, kyonki vah varsh 2008 main congress main shaamil hone se pehle tak samaajawaadee party kaa hi hissaa rahe hai

 Congress sources told NDTV that until the discord between the Yadavas is over and they do not forget their mutual differences, they cannot lure anyone as a 'linker'

 narayan murtine jindagi main vah sab kuch dekha he: mutthibhar rakam se kaarobaar kaa ek bada samrajya khadaa karnaa, wespa scooter kii pichhali seat par baithkar saamaan bechney ke liye nikalnaa, munafa na hone kii vajah se jeei (general electric) kii deal se inkaar karnaa, hindustan ke pehle vishaal software parisar kii sthapana, apni company ko america stock exange nasdac main listing karaane vaali hindustan kii pehali company bananaa, desh main sarvshereshth kaamkaaj ke maanakon kii sthapana or 6 arab dollar kii salanaa aay vaale upkram se sevanivritti lenaa
 In view of the current challenges facing Infosys, Chaitanya Kalabagh, Editor of Business Today, had a special conversation with Murthy, whose edited excerpts are given here
 66 varshiya murti ne infosis ke beete saalon or bhavishya par vistaar se baat kii or jataa diya ki ve sabhi pahaluon se ab bhi utane hi waakif hai
 Explain what you are doing after taking a leave of two years before an important executive role in Infosys? And how do you think Infosys is doing overall? See, i am just an investor in it now
 main iskaa sabase bada share holderan
 Infosys a new business model Infosys 3
 0 ke saath aayaa, jiskaa makasad tha oonche darje ke kaarobaar par dhyaan kendrit karnaa
 When it was introduced, the economy of Western countries was going through a recession and in such difficult times the company was trying to implement new ideas, new ideas
 mujhe lagata he, is vajah se us vakt iske logon ke bich kaaphi khinchataan rahi hogi
 In addition, Capita revenue productivity at Infosys has been 20-25% higher than other companies
 isliye, kisi chunauteepurn bazaar main aisi oonchi kism kii revenue productivity sevaaon kii bikri aasaan nahin, aise bazaar main jo laagat ko lekar behad chaukanna ho
 i think Infosys faced challenges last year for these two reasons
 lekin pichhali timahi main unhone kuch had tak badhat hasil kar lee thi
 Such a perception is increasingly deepened that less attention is being paid to consumers
 vishleshkon se yahi sunne ko miltaa he ki infosis ke saath len-dein karnaa behad mushkil ho gaya he
 See, Infosys Kore does not believe in signing paper
 ham har niyam-kanoon samajhate hai
 Most Indian companies say, "hey! What's in it, let's sign it now
 '' ve shaayad samajhati nahin ki isse kitni badi jimmedaari aa jaati he
 Secondly, we have been of the opinion that the conditions on which we are ready should be fully respected when the time comes
 hindustani companiyon kii sabase badi khami rahi he ki ham saudon ke byoron ko thik se dekhte bhi nahin
 The post of COO in Infosys has been lying vacant for a long time
 aise main koi spasht uttaradhikari nahin dikh rahaa
 The company is somewhat rearranged in such a way that Bala (v
 baalkrishnan), bi
 Yes
 shrinivas or ashok wemuri ke bich puri company cover ho gai he
 Each of them takes it as an independent company
 aise main management ko sioo kii jarurat mahasoos nahin hui
 a situation of struggle for succession can be created
 
 
 in teenon main koun kis tarah kaa or kaisaa kaam karte hai, ise jaanane ke paimaane spasht hai
 Whichever will do better, the team people will choose him
 sambhavit ummidavaar to teenon hai
 The Infosys brand's image as an employer among the youth is getting a bit bleak
 pichley do saalon main company main is mudde par khaasi bahes hui ki kya jwine karne ja rahe naujavaanon kii niyukti philhal taal di jaae? hamane kaha ki un yuvaaon ne chaar saal college main bitaye, maa-baap ne un par khaase paise kharch kiye or hamane jaakar unhen naukari kaa ofer diya, ab agar ham unhen naukari nahin denge to bacchon ko ghar par bekaar baithna hoga
 However, we have the right to postpone the appointment for some time
 kai companiyon ne aisa kiya bhi he
 But we decided that we would welcome those young men
 par sach he ki jab kaarobaar manda chal rahaa ho or aapane 25,000 or bhi logon kii bhartee kar lee to unamem aise log bhi honge jinke paas karne ke liye kuch khaas nahin hoga
 As an honorary chairman, are you still ready to meet and talk to people? par ve mere paas aaen or baat karen
 i do not go and talk
 kal hi maine ek stritji conference main jaakar lacture diya kyonki unhone mujhe bulaayaa tha
 There is a saying in all of our homes that grandparents should speak only when asked
 nahin to unki izzat nahin rahegi
 So that's why i would behave that way
 phir bhi dekha jaae to infosis aapke bachche ke bhi bachche jaisaa he or aap sabase bade share holder hai
 But such a situation is not going to happen if they say, 'mr
 murti, waapas aa jaaie
 ''no
 
 
 nahin, ve sab bahut achche or smart log hai
 So according to you, there will never be such a situation that you feel the need officially? i don't think, but who knows the future
 ahm logon ke saath kuch ho jaae, unka swasthya kharaab ho jaae, koun jaanata he? 'katai nahin' main nahin kahana chahta
 But look at the figures; Look at what is happening in front of me; Those who are there, see them; Looking at his talent, energy and commitment, you can say that i or anyone will not need to come back to Infosys
 aapane stritji conference main bhaashan diya
 What would be your suggestion to the Infosys leadership as of today? In fact, i talked about that the gap with competitors would have to be sustained
 maine kaha ki khel ke siddhantkaron ke mutabik to ranneeti yah honi chahie ki jo pratispardhi tumhen pachhadgaye kii koshish kar rahaa ho, use pachaado
 But i believe that a concrete kind of distance should be created, so that customers can be given better work for better profits
 mere hisaab se yah faasla bahut ahmiyat rakhata he, graahakon ko behatar mulya or behatar munafa dena bhi behad ahm he
 i think that when you analyze, it is very important to look at our depreciation policy and what we are providing, besides what we are spending on training of every employee
 uske baad aap munaafe kii gananaa karen
 So you say that your rules of depreciation are very different? We deprecate most of the technology in two years
 software ko ham usee saal batte khate main daal dete hai
 5,000
 se neeche kii kisi bhi cheez ko ham batte khate main daal dete hai
 We reduce the price of buildings in 15 years instead of a fixed period of 28 years
 graahakon se agar hamen 180 dinon ke andar paise nahin mili tab ham or praavdhaan karte hai
 Somebody in the company will have to do this analysis and tell us about our true profits
 or yah baat gaur karne kii he ki un praavdhaanon ke baad company kaa munafa acha rahaa
 
 
 At once
 yah hamaare khun kaa aisa hissaa ban gaya he ki cells ke hamaare log ab keemton ko kam nahin karnaa chaahate, kyonki agar aap keemat kam karenge to munafa kam ho jayega
 So selling in a difficult market will become more difficult
 meraa hameshaa se najariya rahaa he, main top line (kul bikri or rajasav) kii nahin balki bottm line (shuddh munaafe) kii parvaah karata hum
 In 2000 / 2001, we had a 100 per cent growth
 10 yaa 11 april, 2001 ko maine ek vishleshan taiyaar kiya or main 30 fisadi se hi santusht tha
 Everyone said what will happen now? The stock price will fall
 maine kaha ki main is company ko share kii keemton par nahin chalaata
 i run this company on the basis of how we can keep our customers satisfied and how happy our employees are
 yahi salaah maine (siio es

 pichley maheene asthai seat ke liye bharat kaa rasta us samay saaf ho gaya tha, jab asia se iskaa ekmaatr pratidwandvi kazakhstan daud se peeche hat gaya tha

 The BJP strongly criticized Rahul Gandhi's statement of comparing the Sangh to the banned terrorist organization SIMI, saying, 'where would the eater with a golden spoon know the difference between national antics and national love
 ’bhaajapa ke pravaktaa sanjay seth ne patrakaron se kaha, ‘rahul gandhi ko kya pataa hoga ki raashtra prem kya hota he
 Eating with a spoon of gold has little to do with ground reality
 ’rahul gandhi ke buudhvaar ko bhopal main diye gayi us bayaan kii unhone kadi bhartsana kii jisamen unhone rashtriya swayan sevak sangh kii simi se tulana karte hue kaha tha ki donon kii vichaardhaara main koi fark nahin he
 Seth said that the state BJP had met Rahul Gandhi's statement irresponsible and childish at the meeting and also said that the learner of politics from Italy will know the difference between nationalism and terrorism
 bhaajapa ne aarope lagaaya ki drawing rum raajnneeti karne vaale netaaon ko 120 karod logon ke bharat desh main sirf ek kalavati milti he or vah uskaa bhi dard dur nahin kar pate or sirf uskaa dukhada rote hai
 The party was quoting Rahul Gandhi's statement of pain of a woman named Kalavati
 seth ne kaha ki rahul gandhi ko abhi bahut kuch siikhnaa he or yah bhi samajhnaa he ki unhen shiksha dene vaale log unhen bhramit kar rahe he
 He said, 'they feel that till now there is no difference between good and bad
 unhen jo likh kar de diya jaataa he athwa jo samajha diya jaataa he vah bolne lagate he
 'not only India, but the whole world is familiar with the Sangh's devotion to the Sangh and the services of Sandha in the nation at all times and especially in the time of objection
 aaj sangh se bada vishwa main koi bhi saamaajik sanghathan nahin he
 He said that it takes decades even for those born and raised in the soil of this place to know and understand the ground reality, but here, Rahul, who suddenly arrived in India from the culture of Italy, started talking without any hesitation and in defense of him It is clear from the statements made by the top Congress leadership that the top leadership of the Congress is trying to take them on the wrong path

 Visambhar Prasad's candidature was announced by the party's national general secretary and spokesperson Prof

 By making Nishad a candidate, the party has tried to convince the running class due to lack of proper representation during the Lok Sabha elections

 The SP candidate's victory was being decided in terms of arithmetic of votes, but in the same way the SP had sent support to Congress leader Pramod Tiwari to Rajya Sabha when Rashid Masood's seat was vacant, when the party called it political etiquette
 isliye is baar bhi sapa pratyaashee ko lekar tarah-tarah kii atakalein lagaai ja rahi thim
 However, the manner in which the party was reduced to just five seats in the Lok Sabha elections, it was believed that SP will send its own leader to Rajya Sabha this time

 According to the report of pucl

 This time the BJP is asking the Congress who was saving Ishrat
 kiske ishaare par bachaaya ja rahaa tha
 Even then Mani could have told about the cigarette stain because he was not silent like Pillai
 cigarette se daagne kii jaanch to honi hi chahie
 Two affidavits were discussed in the year 2009 also
 agast ke halafname main ishrat ko lashkar kaa aatanki bataaya gaya tha jise sitambar 2009 ke halafname se hataa diya gaya

 mani ne poochtacha karne vaale ipies afasar satish verma par gambhir aarope lagaae the
 Although Verma did not consider them to be worth answering, but according to Mani, Satish Verma had told him that the 26 / 11 attacks in Parliament and Mumbai were carried out by the Indian government itself to strengthen anti-terrorism laws
 mani ne satish verma ko sahi kot kiya yaa ye bayaan vibhaagon kii aatanrik jhagade kii raajnneeti se prerit tha
 The Congress has asked whether the statement of such an officer should be taken seriously
 isliye kendriya mantri ravishankar prasad kii baat sahi he ki is maamle main nyaayik jaanch honi chahie taaki pataa lage ki grih mantralay ke bheetar afasar kya khel khel rahe the or yah khel kis mantri ke ishaare par khelaa ja rahaa tha
 The case is old and the Gujarat High Court constituted an SIT to investigate it
 sibiai ne bhi jaanch kii lekin abhi tak trial shuru nahin ho sakaa he
 There is a side that Ishrat Jahan and three others killed along with him were let terrorists and they wanted to kill the then Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi
 in chaaron ko police ne encounter main maar diya
 There is a side that the encounter was fake
 javed shaikh naam kaa shaks jo ibi afasar rajendra kumaar ke liye kaam karata tha, uskaa istemaal kar in chaaron ko ahmedabad bulaayaa gaya
 Ishrat knew Javed beforehand
 phir pillai ne kaise kah diya ki ek akeli muslim ladki paraaye mardon ke saath kaise ja sakati he
 Does Javed have the same opinion about how he knew, knew or did not know Rajendra Kumar
 2011 main enie ne is maamle kii jaanch kar rahe esaiti ke chayaraman ko likhaa tha ki david colman ne ishrat jahaan kaa naam liya he lekin koi saboot nahin he isliye ise mukademe kaa hissaa nahin banaaya ja saktaa he
 Chidambaram says that he takes responsibility and Pillai is equally responsible for this
 congress kaa kahana he ki wo chidambaram ke saath he
 She was targeted since she was in government
 bijepi bhi yahi kahati he ki use is maamle ko lekar target kiya jaataa rahaa he
 The Congress has clarified in favor of the second affidavit that the first affidavit was filed on August 6, 2009, when there was a perception that Ishrat was associated with Lashkar
 encounter main maari gai he
 On 7 September 2009, Metropolitan Magistrate SP Tamang found that the encounter was fake and there is no evidence that Ishrat had links with the let
 adaalat ke is aadesh ke alok main grih mantralay ne apane halafname main sanshodhan kiya tha

 This time the BJP is asking the Congress who was saving Ishrat

 Mani rightly quoted Satish Verma or this statement was inspired by the politics of internal quarrels of the departments
 congress ne poocha he ki kya aise afasar ke bayaan ko gambhirtha se liya janaa chahie
 Therefore, Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad is right that there should be a judicial inquiry into the matter to find out what officials were playing within the Ministry of Home Affairs and at the behest of which Minister
 purana maamla he or isaki jaanch ke liye gujarat hai court ne esaiti banaai
 The CBI also investigated but the trial has not started yet

 kunal ne kaha- maine uskaa naam rakhaa he
 Both i and Soha had made a list of children's names
 phir hamane inaaya naam rakhane kaa sochaa, nomi naam hamane isliye rakhaa kyonki wo navami ke din paidaa hui thi
 It looks like soha-kunal's daughter, the first photo that came out was like Alien
 Inaaya said that when i saw Inaaya for the first time, she looked like an alien, but most of the children look like this
 wo sirf 11 din kii he or zyaadaatar soti rahati he
 She is a nice and quiet baby girl
 wo bilkul nahin roti
 His eyes are always closed
 jab wo apni ankhen kholti he to bahut pyaari lagati he
 Soha Ali Khan became Mummy, gave Daima daughter to birth, Taimur did so Reactkunal told that Taimur had also come to meet Inaaya, but he did not react anything special
 wo khud ek baccha he to usase ham zyada ummid kar bhi nahin sakate
 When he meets someone he either laughs or cries, but whenever i feed him with a lap, he is very happy

 It is believed that Najeeb Jung resigned because of these controversies and differences

 The Congress accused the BJP of spreading lies on social media in panic
 vipakshi dal ne kaha ki is mudde kii shikaayat vah chunaav ayog se karegaa
 The letter reportedly carries the signature of Solanki, addressed to Congress President Sonia Gandhi

 ek samay tha, jab aap donon ek-duusare ke behad kareeb the or yah tay kar liya tha ki jindagi saath hi bithaayenge
 Both of you started feeling that life would never be complete without each other
 par achaanak kuch aisa ho jaataa he ki aap donon alag ho jate hai or yah tay kar lete hai ki ab aap kabhi ek-duusare kaa cheharaa tak nahin dekhenge
 But the medicine of the time reduces the bitterness of your mind and you feel that you have also missed some way in handling the relationship
 aise main agar aapke man main ye khyaal aa rahaa he ki kyon na us rishte ko ek or mauka diya jaae to eks ke paas lautne se pehle ye sawaal khud se jarur karen:1
 Do you really want to give that relationship another chance after so much struggle and quarrel? Answer this question from both heart and mind
 2
 After so long, how did you suddenly realize that your former partner is capable of becoming your life partner
 3
 Are you being very emotional and are not taking this decision? Or is it that your loneliness is making you think? 4
 aapse behatar yah koi nahin bataa saktaa he ki us rishte main dobaaraa padane par aapako kya keemat chukaani hogi
 In such a situation, stop lying to yourself and decide based on logic
 5
 Will your ex boyfriend still be ready to adopt you? Are you sure about this? Would no one have come in his life while away from you? 6
 aapako kyon lagata he ki ab aap us rishte ko behatar tareeke se sambhaal lenge jabaki kuch vakt pehle aap hi uske saath banaae gaye rishte ko apni jindagi kii sabase badi bhul maan rahe the? There is good news for Madhya Pradesh, which is chilling due to severe cold

 Amidst the discussions on the grand alliance in Jammu and Kashmir, state BJP president Jugal Kishore Sharma said that the pdp's grand alliance formula would betray the people of the state
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki agar aisa hua to, yah bijepi ko mili janaadhar kaa apmaan hoga
 Jugal Kishore told NDTV that BJP has got the mandate to form the government and the party will fulfill this responsibility
 bijepi mahasachiv ram madhav ke saath rajyapal se mulaakaat karne vaale jugal kishor sharma ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha, party netaa 1 janvari ko rajyapal se mulaakaat karke apana prastaav saunpenge
 Today's meeting with the Governor can be seen as part of the ongoing process of government formation in the state
 unhone kaha, sarkaar gathan kii prakriya jari he or is prakriya ke dauraan log milte rahete hai, lekin rajyapal ke saath hamaari aupchaarik mulaakaat 1 janvari ko hogi, jab bijepi unhen apana prastaav saunpegi
 Significantly, the PDP introduced the idea of forming a government in Jammu and Kashmir by forming a 'grand alliance' with its anti-national National Conference and Congress, after which a new twist in the claim of power was made
 pidipi ke mukhya pravaktaa naeem akhtar ke pidipi, neshnal conference or congress ke bich mahagathbandhan ko bhi ek 'vikalp' bataane sambandhi bayaan ke baad aisi atakalein lagaai ja rahi hai ki kya yah bijepi par dabaav banane kii ranneeti to nahin hai, jiske liye pidipi ne kadi sharten laga di hai

 ' bhagwaan krishna kaa janm jis prakaar pracheen mathura kii andheri kaal kothri main hua tha, usee prakaar moscow kaa ekmaatr krishna mandir kiraye kii ek imaarat ke tahkhaane main maujuud he
 The Hindu temple operated by iskcon's Moscow unit had to be relocated to a temporary underground
 ise prashasan or rudhiwaadi dharmik samoohon dwaara asahyog mana ja rahaa he
 ISKCON had earlier made efforts to build the temple on the officially allotted land, which had failed
 moscow main isckon ke liye is mudde ko dekh rahe sadhu priya das ke liye pradhanmantri ke taur par narendra modi ke aagaman ne masco main ek krishna mandir ke nirmaan kii ummiden jagaa di hai
 Das told an IANS correspondent, "we sincerely hope that our temple will be built in the present term of Modi ji
 " The history of Hare Krishna movement's efforts to build temples is as bizarre as it sounds
 america vanshavali ke saath hi puja ke anokhe tareekon ke kaaran sarkari tantra main shuruaati andeh ke baad 1988 main hare krishna andolan ko pehali baar vaidhata de di gai thi
 Its real difficulties, however, began in 2004 when the only temple at Begovaya Avenue was demolished by the civil administration due to an urban development project
 uske baad isckon ko 'leningradeski prospect' main jagah de di gai thi
 But this step was strongly opposed by the orthodox 'russian Orthodox Church', which ultimately led to its stoppage
 masco ke upnagar main jameen ke ek anya tukade par jab mandir nirmaan shuru hone hi vaala tha, tab sarkaar ne use bhi waapas le liya
 Das said, "we faced a long process for the construction of the temple, but in the end the government took back the land
 lagbhag paanch saal purv hamen mandir nirmaan ke liye ek or jameen dene kaa vaada kiya gaya tha, lekin ab tak kuch nahin hua he
 The temple is currently in a basement in a rented building
 " According to ISKCON, the Krishna temple will not only serve the religious needs of the Indian population of 15,000 people and 25,000 ISKCON followers living in the Russian capital, but will also serve as a social and cultural center for South Asians
 bharat main modi ke netritv vaali rashtriya janatantric gathbandhan (rajg) sarkaar hone ke saath hi masco ke isckon anuyaayiyon kii ummiden is baat se or bad gai hai ki roosi duutavas ke aagrah ke baad bhartiya prashasan ne pichley saal nai dilli main desh ke pehle 'roosi orthodox carch' ke nirmaan kii ijaajat de di thi
 Das said, "the Indian government has allowed the construction of a (russian) Orthodox Church in India which is a good sign of friendship
 mujhe puri ummid he ki jald hi rus main ek hindu mandir bhi ban jayega

 50 Rajasthan vs Chennai uttar pradesh ke mujffarnagar pahunche bhartiya janata party yani bijepi ke uttar pradesh prabharee amit shah ne kaha he ki hamen vot dene ke do phaayde honge
 One will form the Narendra Modi government in Delhi and the other will be sacked by Mulayam from Uttar Pradesh
 saath hi unhone kaha ki maaya or mulaayam ko upi se baahar koi nahin jaanata he
 BJP UP President Amit Shah arrived in Muzaffarnagar today, where he said while speaking at a meeting of a Sarva Samaj that when we were small, we used to hear that a government can be formed in India only if Uttar Pradesh wants to
 aaj aisa kya ho gaya he, jo upi kii ichha ke bina patta bhi nahin hilta tha or ab upi ke bina sarkaar banane lagi
 He said that no one knows your leader outside UP
 maharashtra main janata he koi aapke netaa ko
 You chose Bahn ji as the leader, who limited Uttar Pradesh to Uttar Pradesh
 jis pradesh se puure desh kii siyasat chalati thi use sapa or basapa ne chota kar diya
 This time the lotus will be stamped, then Modi's government will be formed at the center and the Mulayam government will be removed from UP

 Opportunity to get a vacancy in the Ministry of Defense for the 12th pass in the Ministry of Defense
 Vacancy for bharat or china ke bich seemaa ko lekar tanaav jari he
 Even before this, Chinese soldiers have shown their courage on the Indian border many times, but they also had to return backfoot when the Indian troops immediately opposed
 bhartiya seemaa par suraksha ko lekar uttarakhand border ko bhi behad samvedansheel mana jaataa he
 Despite this, the concern of tourism, not the border, is more visible by the state government
 shaayad yahi vajah he kii suraksha se samjhauta karte hue sarkaar ne 1962 se yatriyon ke liye pratibandhit uttarkashi jile kii harshil or gangotri neshnal park ko sabhi deshi or videshi paryatakon ke liye khol diya he
 This permission has also been given by the Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India
 is behad tanaavpurn maahaul main ye chintan karne kaa vishay he kyonki jis tarah ke halaat is samay bane hue hai, use dekhakar paryaton nahin balki seemaa suraksha kii taraf dhyaan dene kii jarurat he
 Ministry of Home Affairs got permission to visit Nelang Valley on June 19, has issued orders to this effect
 isi ke saath ab videshi sailaani bhi prashasan kii anumati se bharat-china seemaa par sthit nelang ghati kii saiyr kar sakenge
 In view of the situation created after the india-china war in 1962, the Government of India had banned the movement of tourists in the Inner Line area of uttarkashi and since then the Nelang Valley and Jadung villages were evacuated and paramilitary forces were stationed there
 yahaan ke gaanvon main rahane vaale logon ko ek nishchit prakriya puri karne ke baad saal main ek hi baar apane devi-devataaon ko poojane kii ijaajat di jaati rahi he
 After this, the Home Ministry of India gave permission to the common people of India to reach Nelang Valley in 2015, although the ban on foreigners remained intact
 raat bitaane kii anumati nahiprail maah main jila prashasan ne inner line ke sambandh main shashan ko vistrut report bheji
 The orders were issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs after sending the administration documents
 aadesh ke mutabik inner line ab harshil kasbe se 50 meter dur hogi
 However, it will be marked by the local administration
 aadesh ke anusaar deshi-videshi sailaani nelang ghati ja to sakenge, lekin inner line kshetra main unhen raat bitaane kii anumati nahin hogi
 Tourists will be able to stay here due to Harshil being out of the inner line, 75 kilometers from Uttarkashi
 kya ye sahi nirnay he?kuch samay pehle tak uttarkashi main tainaat ITBP ke ek bade adhikari kaa kahana he ki kisi bhi haal main paryatak sthal bananaa is ghati kii suraksha se samjhaute ke baraabar hoga
 If it is indeed opened to ordinary tourists and foreign tourists then these will not be good signs
 abhi ham sirf border kii suraksha main hi din raat lage hai, par is anumati ke baad to phir hamaara dhyaan un paryatakon par bhi hoga jo yahaan ghoomane aaenge
 Now in such a situation, security will be more important or the permission given for tourists to have fun

 He said that the Speaker cannot lose sight of the fact that the intention of these mlas is to destabilize the coalition government
 unka kahana tha ki yah adhyaksh banaam nyaayalay kaa maamla nahin he

 an unknown person who wants to become the Chief Minister and topple this government
 unhone nyaayalay se un antarim aadesh ko waapas lene kaa anurodh kiya tha jiname adhyaksh ko istifon par nirnay lene or yathasthiti banaaye rakhane kaa nirdesh diya tha

 On behalf of the Speaker, senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi said that a petition was filed by the rebel mlas to disqualify him before resigning on 11 July, when he appeared before the Speaker personally
 singhvi ne kaha tha ki yah sarvavidit he ki 15 vidhayakon main se 11 ne vyaktigat rup se apane istife 11 july ko aghyaksh ko saunpe or in tyagpatron ko ayogyata kii kaarywahi ko nirarthak banane kaa aadhaar nahin banaaya ja saktaa

 Today's verdict by the Jharkhand High Court has deepened the eclipse on the political life of 66-year-old Lalu Prasad Yadav and has now become a matter of intense concern for his party, the Rashtriya Janata Dal, about his party's 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 What will happen to the preparations
 nichali adaalat ke faisle ke baad do saptaah purv hi lalu prasad yadav or jediu saansad jagadish sharma kii sansad sadsyta bhi supreme court ke july ke us faisle ke tahat chin lee gai he, jisamen usne do varsh se adhik kii sajaa paane vaale saansadon or vidhayakon kii sansad yaa vidhansabha kii sadsyta tatkaal khatm kar die jane ke aadesh die the
 Lalu Prasad Yadav and his party have been shocked by this decision today and now if they do not get bail in this case even from Supreme Court, then RJD will be devoid of leadership in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, which is not only the politics of Bihar , But is also expected to have far-reaching effects on the country's politics

 1
 While working as an Air Force soldier, Rakesh Sharma did not think that his journey would reach from here to space
 apane safar ko yaad karte hue sharma ne ek baar kaha tha ki maine bachapan se payalat banane kaa sapana dekha tha, jab main payalat ban gaya to sochaa sapana puraa ho gaya
 After the death of the child, medical studies became an example for the country
 2 april 1984 ko do anya soviet antarikshayatriyon ke saath soyuj tii-11 main rakesh sharma ko launch kiya gaya
 In this flight, he photographed northern India at the Salyut 7 Space Center and practiced gravity-less yoga

 When Rakesh Sharma arrived in space, it was a 'no' for the people of India to accept
 logon ko yakeen nahin ho rahaa tha ki koi maanav jeev antariksh main ja rahaa he
 4
 rakesh sharma ne1966 main ndapasa kar indian air force cadet bane
 Then joined the Indian Air Force in 1970

 vajah thi shuukravaar raat kii dilli kii wo dinar party jisame amar singh kii mulaaqaat gulam nabi azaad or ajit singh se hui

 It was clear that mulayam-shivpal and Amar Singh were upset with Akhilesh Yadav's growing stature within the Congress and he wanted the alliance on his own terms and not on Akhilesh Yadav's terms
 akhilesh ne maaraa maukey par chaukaa !akhilesh yadav ne bhi maukey ko bhampa or jaise hi gathbandhan par palitha lagata dikhaa akhilesh ne bhi apni sabhi 403 siton kii list mulaayam singh yadav ke saamne rakh di

 mulaayam singh ne gayatri ko rashtriya sachiv banaakar apni ore se congress ko sanket de diya he
 On the one hand, Mulayam Singh Yadav is denying the alliance, on the other hand, he is also trying to remove the bottlenecks of the alliance, it is believed that Amar Singh is doing everything behind the scenes so that Mulayam Singh's formula for alliance with Congress is agreed
 Can be made

 a Delhi court has sentenced two youths to 10 years in prison for gang rape in a moving car after they kidnapped their younger sister in order to avenge her
 atirikt satr nyaayadhish kamini lau ne apharan or balaatkaar ke jurm main 24 varshiya manoj ko umr kaid or uske saathi amit ko das saal kii kaid kii sajaa sunai he
 The court has also fined them sixty thousand and twenty thousand rupees respectively
 in donon ne ek ladki ko sabak sikhaane ke iraade se uski 12 saal kii bahan kaa apharan kar usase samuhik balaatkaar kiya tha
 The court said that when the accused could not find the victim's sister, Manoj targeted his 12-year-old minor sister
 adaalat ne kaha ki is tathy ko nazarandaaj nahin kiya ja saktaa he ki do anya mahilaon ko sabak sikhaane ke liye hi is naaballig ladki se balaatkaar kiya gaya or isliye manoj ke saath kisi prakaar kii narmi nahin barti ja sakati
 The court also took cognizance of the fact that Manoj was living the life of symbiosis with a woman, who was a sister of a minor girl's sister, but due to some disputes, the couple often started approaching the police
 adaalat ne kaha ki police ke saamne bhi peedit ladki kii bahan apni saheli kaa hi paksh leti thi or shaayad isi vajah se manoj ne use sabak sikhaane kaa nishchay kiya
 The record also shows that when the minor girl was going to the market on February 6 last year, she found Manoj on the way
 manoj ne pehle uski bahan ke bare main poocha, lekin kuch samay baad vah use hi lekar chalaa gaya
 According to the prosecution, the girl said that her sister is at home and he can meet her there
 lekin isi bich doosraa aaropee amit car se vahaan pahunchaa or manoj ne is ladki ko jabaran car main daal liya
 According to the police, both the accused threatened the minor girl and after that Manoj raped her in a car at a deserted place
 iske baad, amit ne bhi usase balaatkaar kiya or kai jagah ghumaane ke baad mongolpuri ilaake main use chhod gaya
 When the girl did not return home, family members started searching for her
 chunki manoj police kaa mubir tha, isliye unhone police adhikariyon se bhi sampark kiya jinhone aaropee se ladki ko khojane main madad karne ke liye kaha
 According to the police, when the elder sister contacted on the mobile phone, this girl was found in the middle of the night and she informed about her whereabouts
 ladki ne is ghatana ke bare main parivaar ko jaankaree di or donon ke naam bataaye
 Only then the police arrested both
 adaalat ne donon abhiyukton kii is daleel ko asweekaar kar diya ki unhen jhuthe maamle main fansaaya gaya he
 The court said medical and forensic evidence make it clear that he raped the girl
 adaalat ne kaha ki chunki manoj police kaa mubir tha, isliye police ne behad halke tareeke se is maamle kii jaanch kii thi
 The court said that Manoj, being an informer of the police, took undue advantage of his position and thought that he was above the law

 viraat kohli, shikhar dhawan, akaash chopra or pradeep sangwan kii baat bhi chal rahi he
 Is quite talented
 ye irani trophy main acha parfarm karte hai to inhen mauka mil saktaa he
 Simon Katich just said that india-australia series is bigger than Ashes? Well, india-australia series is bigger than Ashes
 austrailia or england kii aabaadi ko mila di jaae to bharat usase kahin bada desh he
 More viewers watch the series than in India
 iske saath josh bahut he, darshak zyada he, kawarej zyada he to khud ba khud yah badi siries ho jaati he
 Hype is also very high
 vaise bhi vishwa champion austrailia ke saath khelte hue majaa aata he
 Australia is a very strong team
 haa, ek baat or bharat austrailia ke bich ekatarfa match nahin hota
 India also gives a tough fight
 ji, pichley kuch samay se aisa ho rahaa he ki donon team ek ek match jitati he or antim main jo match jeetta he vah vijeta ho jaataa he
 Looking at the Australian team this time, can it be assumed that India will be a favorite? idhar bharat ne acha khel dikhaaya he
 India's pan is really heavy
 austrailia kii gendbaaji main is baar kami dikhegi
 Bowlers like Shane Warne and mcgrath are no longer part of the Australian team
 spin gendbaaj kii kami khalegi kyonki bharat main pich spin gendbaaji ko madad detii hai
 Okay, so is it a batsman speaking or
 
 
 ji bilkul, kisi bhi team ko dekhie to pataa chalegaa ki jo tej gendbaaji ko khel letaa he, use phir badhia spin gendbaaji out kar sakati he, jo philhal austrailia ke paas nahin he
 What do you mean to this series or this season for yourself? It means a lot, i would like to score runs against Australia, make big scores which i have been doing because when you score against a good team it will be praised And every player wants his game to be praised

 It has been difficult for James Bond
 bharat ke parde par vah saare kaam kar saktaa he magar ek kaam karne kii use puri ijazat nahin he
 i felt Bond was unhappy so i wrote Bond a letter
 darasal, ek film aa rahi he, 'spector'
 Bond does something in each of his films, which he imitates becomes a don in Indian films
 ek taraf bond he, duusari taraf don he
 Now i do not know whether the work which cannot be bonded, can be donned or not
 he james bond 
 
 
 
 tum kisi kanya ke saath vicharan to kar sakate ho
 
 
 You can also have a conversation
 
 
 
 
 lekin ruko
 
 
 
 
 u dont
 
 
 kyonki tum bharat main ho james bond
 
 hamen sanskari james bond acha lagata he
 
 
 Sanskari Bond like Alok Nath
 
 
 kuch tasveeron main tumhaara yauvan bina baniyaan vaali tasviir se zyada nikharata he

 The larceny theft has not come from the West in India
 vaise persenalee mujhe tumhaara ye suut bahut acha lagata he
 
 
 googletag
 cmd
 push (function () {googletag
 display('adslotnativevideo'); }); From Wasim Taylor to Rahman Taylor, he kept measuring everyone
 
 
 lekin koi aisa laajawab suut nahin sil sakaa
 
 
 
 or ye tumhaari car
 
 
 
 sab kuch kaatilaanaa he
 
 
 
 
 Everything
 
 
 
 
 tum un jagahon par kitne smartli chale lete ho
 
 
 Where we have just seen monkeys moving
 
 
 
 Oh wow
 
 
 
 What do you aim 
 
 james
 
 
 You are amazing 
 
 magar tum sanskari nahin ho
 
 
 
 
 James
 
 
 
 
 tum yahaan akele khadey-khadey kya soch rahe ho
 
 
 
 kya hinsa par praayshchit karnaa chaahate ho
 
 
 But you will not kiss 
 
 shoot nahin karoge
 
 
 So what will you do? 
 
 
 Kissing has been a part of Indian culture
 
 
 
 But Pahlaj Nihalani's part is something else
 
 
 suna he
 
 
 The censor board has summarized two shots of the kiss embrace, cut in English
 pehlaaj yug se pehle bhartiya cinema main ek nayak ne to apni film main chumme kaa aahvaan kiya tha
 For Chumme, the hero cut the heroine and reminded Jumme's promise
 magar ab vakt badal gaya he
 
 
 
 suraj nikal gaya he
 
 
 
 
 Everything that goes wrong with Indian culture is being sent to London in the morning
 pehlaaj se pehle tumhaari jitani bhi filmein ai hai unamem tumne (bond) nayika kaa chumban kiya he, darasal, pehle ke pehlaaj pramukh bhartiya samskruti se vimukh ho gaye the
 
 
 
 chumban jaise ashleel drishyon se rasranjan kar rahe the
 
 
 
 chumban par roak nahin he
 
 
 But if the kissing time gets longer then there is problem
 
 
 sutron ke hawaale se akhabaaron ne likhaa he ki bhartiya filmon main bhi chumban ke kaal ko kam kiya ja rahaa he
 Do not understand that Pahlaj saheb hates the West
 
 
 aisa bilkul nahin he
 
 
 
 tippaniyan Recently he made a video, in the pride of the Prime Minister
 
 
 
 In this video, his qualities of the West were sung
 pashchim ke hathiyaaron rocketon ko istemaal kiya gaya tha
 
 
 
 hangaamaa hua ki ye to pashchim kaa he
 
 
 Is foreign
 
 
 
 Bond removed from video
 
 
 ye mat samajhnaa ki pehlaaj sirf tumhaara hi seen katate hai
 
 
 
 ve itane achche hai ki apana banaaya video bhi hataa lete hai
 So hey bond
 
 
 is film main jo tumne suut pahani he wo mujhe de janaa
 
 
 Appearing in Tum dhoti-kurta in the next film
 
 
 
 
 bond apni har film main kuch na kuch aisa karata he, jisaki nakal se bharat kii filmon main don ban jaataa he
 On one side is Bond, on the other side is Don
 ab mujhe yah nahin maaloom ki jo kaam bond nahin kar saktaa, wo kaam don kar saktaa he yaa nahin
 Hey James Bond
 
 
 
 You can move around with a girl
 
 
 vaartalap bhi kar sakate ho
 
 
 
 
 But hold on
 
 
 
 
 tum ye nahin kar sakate
 
 
 Because you are in India James Bond
 
 We like the cult James Bond
 
 
 alok nath kii tarah sanskari bond
 
 
 In some pictures, your youth glows more than a photo of a vest

 Bond
 
 
 lakili chori bharat main pashchim se nahin ai he
 By the way, i like this suit of yours very much
 
 
 wasim tailor se lekar rahamaan tailor tak sabko naap detaa rah gaya
 
 
 But no such excellent suit could be stitched
 
 
 
 And this is your car
 
 
 
 Everything is murderous
 
 
 
 
 sab kuch
 
 
 
 
 How smartly do you go to those places
 
 
 jahaan hamane sirf bandaron ko chalate dekha he
 
 
 
 are vaah
 
 
 
 kya nishaanaa lagaate ho
 
 
 James
 
 
 tum kamaal ke ho
 
 
 But you are not cultured
 
 
 
 
 james
 
 
 
 
 What are you thinking standing here alone? 
 
 
 Do you want to atone for violence? 
 
 par tum kis nahin karoge
 
 
 Won't shoot 
 
 to karoge kya bond
 
 
 
 chumban bhartiya samskruti kaa part rahaa he
 
 
 
 lekin pehlaaj nihlani kaa part kuch or he
 
 
 Have heard
 
 
 sensor board ne chumban aalingan ke do shot sankshipt kar die hai, english main cat kar die hai Before the Pahlaj era, a hero in Indian cinema had given a kiss in his film
 chumme ke liye us nayak ne nayika katkar ko jumme kaa vaada yaad dilaayaa tha
 But now the time has changed
 
 
 
 The sun has gone out 
 
 
 
 bhartiya samskruti jin-jin chizon se gadabada jaati he, un sabhi chizon ko savere vaali gaadi se landan ravaanaa kiya ja rahaa he
 You have kissed the (bond) heroine in all the films that have come before Pahlaj, in fact, the earlier Pahlajas were alienated from the dominant Indian culture
 
 
 
 Rasranjan was doing porn scenes like kissing
 
 
 
 No stopping the kiss
 
 
 magar chumban kaa kaal agar lanbaa ho jaae to dikkat he
 
 
 Quoting sources, the newspapers have written that in Indian films too, the kissing period is being reduced
 ye mat samajhnaa ki pehlaaj sahab ko pashchim se nafrat he
 
 
 it's not like that at all
 
 
 
 The comments haal hi unhone ek video banaaya tha, pradhanmantri kii shaan main
 
 
 
 is video main pashchim main unki dhak ke gun gaae gaye the
 The weapons of the west were used rockets
 
 
 
 There was uproar that this is from the west
 
 
 videshi he
 
 
 
 video ko hataa liya gaya bond
 
 
 Do not understand that Pahlaj only cuts your scene
 
 
 
 They are so good that they also delete their own made videos
 at: he bond
 
 
 Give me the suit you are wearing in this film
 
 
 agali film main tum dhoti-kurte main aana
 
 
 
 
 Hey James Bond
 
 
 
 You can move around with a girl
 
 
 vaartalap bhi kar sakate ho
 
 
 
 
 But hold on
