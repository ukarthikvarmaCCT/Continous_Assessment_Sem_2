 Both seem to have been forced to join hands once again
 chaar baar loksabhaa saansad rahe pappu yadav ne 10 aktubar ko lalu ke saath ranchi jail main 45 minute tak baatcheet kii
 There seems to be an agreement between the two

 The percentage of Yadav voters in Bihar is said to be 15 percent
 haalanki koi nahin jaanata ki donon ke bich kya baatcheet hui he, lekin sutron ke mutabik lalu ne pappu se bihar main congress kii ranneeti ke bare main jaankaree maangi thi
 Both of them had a bad loss after getting away from each other just before the 2009 Lok Sabha elections
 lalu ne madhepura ke vivaadaaspad saansad pappu yadav or do anya vidhayakon ko argedy se nikaal diya tha
 The two then suffered heavy losses in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections in northern and north-eastern Bihar as they pitted candidates against each other

 Now he came out of jail in May after being acquitted in the murder case of Ajit Sarkar
 duusari ore, chaara ghotaale main doshi qaraar die jane ke baad ab lalu prasad jail main hai
 It is believed that Lalu is worried about the Congress, because the Congress seems to be extending its hand to Nitish Kumar
 pappu yadav kii patni ranjita ranjan, jo pehle loksabhaa saansad rah chuki hai or 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav se pehle congress main shaamil ho gai thim
 He is still in Congress
 aise sanket hai ki pappu yadav yaa unki patni jedy (you) adhyaksh sharad yadav ke khilaaf chunaav main utar sakati hai

 a new trend is developing among young engineers in the country, which is certainly considered to be worrisome
 ye nae ejeeniyar behatar future ke liye apane study aria main amulchul badlaav karke management institutions kii seedhiyaan chadhane main ab jaraa bhi nahin hichak rahe hai
 The natural reason for engineers to move away from the professional path of the young community towards management in this way is considered to be the growing attraction of thick salary and 'white collar' jobs
 lekin yah rujhaan desh ke academik or kaamkaaji halkon main chintajanak asantulan or asantosh paidaa kar rahaa he
 The latest IIM figures of Indore testify that the country's top B
 skulon main ejineering vaale students kaa dabadabaa kis kadar badhata ja rahaa he
 Of the 457 students who have been admitted to the new batch of iim-i's Post Graduate Program (PGP) for 2013-15, 409 have academic profile engineering, while the remaining 48 students are of 'non-engineer' status
 yani is batch ke takreeban 90 percent students aise hai, jinhone ejineering ke apane mul study aria main aage badhane ke bajaay im se management kii degree hasil karne kaa faisla kiya
 Highlighting this trend, renowned career consultant Dr
 jayantilal bhandari ne bataaya, ‘meraa anumaan he ki desh bhar ke im ke chaatro main se kareeb 75 percent students ejineering kii prishthbhumi ke hai
 After getting an engineering degree, the natural reason for increasing trend of management studies is the desire for a great salary package
 ’bhandari ne kaha ki mote taur par dekha ja rahaa he ki zyaadaatar ejeeniyar vishuddh nirmaan upakramon main naukari ke mukaable management ke niti nirdharak or nirnaayak padon par asin hona chaahate hai
 So they are giving preference to the 'white collar job' of the manager
 unhone kaha ki im or anya pratishthit bi-skulon main pravesh ke liye hone vaale kaaman admician test (cat) main ejiniyaron kii safalataa kii dar duusare vishyon kii prishthbhumi vaale pratibhaagiyon ke mukaable behad zyada he
 This is also a major factor in the increasing dominance of students with engineering backgrounds in the top B-schools in the country
 bhandari haalanki maanate hai ki yah chalan desh ke academik or kaamkaaji jagat ke liye thik nahin he
 This should be seriously considered
 unhone kaha, ‘is chalan se un gaiyr ejeeniyar ummidavaaron main asantosh or kuntha bad rahi he, jo im main daakhile ke liye taiyaari kar rahe hai
 Students holding degrees in non-engineering disciplines feel that their chances of admission in top management institutes like iims are constantly getting reduced

 congress mahasachiv digvijay singh dwaara puche gaye prashnon ko darkinar karte hue india against karpshan (iasi) ke kaaryakarta arvind kejariwal ne ravivaar ko congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi, pradhanmantri manmohan singh or congress mahasachiv rahul gandhi ko bhrashtachar par saarvajanik bahes kii chunauti de di
 However, Congress rejected the challenge
 duusari taraf ieesi ke kaaryakartaaon ne robert wadra evam dlef saude ko manjuuri dene kaa aarope lagaate hue ravivaar ko haryana ke mukhyamantri bhupinder singh hooda ke dilli sthit sarkari awaas par dharna diya
 Kejriwal claimed that several protesters were injured in police lathicharge
 is bich kejariwal ko us vakt samvaadadaata sammelan chhodana padaa jab ieesi kii purv sadsy ne unki hi kaaryastylee par sawaal khadaa kar diya
 Kejriwal told the press conference, "the police lathi-charged the workers while they were peacefully protesting outside the home of Haryana Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda
 kai logon ko chotein ai hai
 Police atrocities on people performing peacefully are scandalous
 " a dramatic situation arose during Kejriwal's press conference when former IAAC member Annie Kohli questioned his functioning
 kohli ne kejariwal se poocha, "jab aap dusron se prashn poochhate hai to ve aap se prashn kyon nahin puch sakate?" Accusing Kejriwal of deviating from Jan Lokpal, he said, "kejriwal should clarify his stand whether he is a politician or a revolutionary
 " Shocked by this sudden change, Kejriwal left the press conference without hearing anything from Kohli
 kejariwal ne kaha, "main pehle kabhi bhi kohli se nahin mila hum
 i think someone sent him
 " Kejriwal also asked Congress general secretary Digvijay Singh, who asked 27 questions, to first get his party chief Sonia Gandhi and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to get answers to corruption charges against the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government
 gyaat ho ki ek din pehle digvijay singh ne kejariwal kii sanstha ko mili aarthik sahaayta or unki sarkari seva ke bare main 27 sawaal puche the
 On the other hand, the Congress has rejected this challenge of Kejriwal
 kendriya sansadeey rajya mantri harish ravat ne kaha ki pradhanmantri har mudde or har vyakti ko jawaab nahin de sakate
 Union Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde termed the method of IAC and Kejriwal as promoting indiscipline in society
 digvijay singh dwaara puche gaye 27 sawaalon par pratikriya vyakt karte hue kejariwal ne ek tivi channel ke saath baatcheet main kaha ki vah in sawaalon ke jawaab tabhi denge, jab digvijay singh congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi or pradhanmantri manmohan singh se bhrashtachar virdohi kaaryakartaaon dwaara puche gaye prashnon ke uttar dilaa denge
 Kejriwal said, "first he should persuade Manmohan Singh, Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi to answer our allegations
 uske baad main unke har prashn kaa jawaab de duungaa
 " isi dauraan, arvind kejariwal ke sahyogi kumaar vishwaas ne congress mahasachiv digvijay singh ko aamane-saamne aakar bahes karne kii chunauti di he
 Vishwas said that Digvijay is a lost leader and he knows nothing except to talk nonsense
 sawaal par bolte hue kumaar vishwaas ne kaha ki digvijay pradhanmantri karyaalay se sawaal kyon nahin poochhate
 
 
 
 digvijay singh ne shanivaar ko kejariwal se sambandhit ek gaiyr sarkari sanghathan ko mili videshi aarthik sahaayta ke bare main sawaal poocha tha
 Kejriwal said, "whatever questions they can ask us about our personal lives, we will answer them
 uske baad ham unase puuchhenge
 
 unhen bhi saarvajanik taur par jawaab dena hoga
 "comments kejariwal ne kaha ki unke sanghathan ne satta paksh va vipakshi dalon ke bich isi gathjod par to sawaal uthaae
 Kejriwal said, "they are not hiding these issues on moral grounds, but on corrupt grounds
 main ise sweekaar karne ke liye digvijay singh ko badhai detaa hum

 karnataka main yediurppa sarkaar ke istife ke baad bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne aaj press conference kar congress-jedies gathbandhan par jamkar nishaanaa saadhaa
 Shah said that the people of Karnataka have voted against the Congress and the BJP had the right to form the government as the largest party, that is why we submitted a claim
 amit shah ne kaha ki hamane koi jod-tod nahin kii he
 If the Congress had left its legislators out of the hotel and swimming pool before the majority test, then the public would have told them where to vote
 unhone kaha ki congress ne apane vidhayakon ko vijayi juluus or jashn manaane kaa mauka tak nahin diya
 If that were the case, the BJP would have won its trust vote
 congress kii ore se lagaae gaye vidhayakon kii kharid-farokht ke aaropon par amit shah ne kaha ki ham par to horse trading kaa galat aarope laga he lekin inhone to puraa astabal bech khaaya he
 He said that the Congress had closed all its mlas in the hotel room in a non-democratic manner, if they had gone among the people, they would have known the public mood
 aaj bhi jab congress apane vidhayakon ko baahar chhodeygi to janata unase jawaab maangegi
 On the claim of forming the government even if there is no claimable majority on being the largest party, Amit Shah said that being the largest party in such a situation, BJP has the right to form the government first
 isi vajah se hamane rajyapal ke saamne sarkaar banane kaa daawa pesh kiya tha or isamen kuch bhi galat nahin he, kyonki agar aisa na karte to dobaaraa chunaav karaane kii naubat aati
 Attacking the jds-congress alliance, Amit Shah said that it is clear from the result that the people of the state have rejected the Congress and made the party which defeated the Congress the largest party
 bijepi kai siton par to nota se bhi kam antar se haari he or janata ne hamen bahumat dene kii puri koshish kii
 On the opposition's celebration, Amit Shah said that the people of Karnataka are not celebrating but congress-jds are celebrating
 unhone kaha ki congress ko chunaav se pehle hi andeshaa tha ki wo chunaav haarane ja rahe hai
 Shah said that the Congress has done the work of breaking all the limits in the election campaign
 saath hi congress adhyaksh ne khud jhootha prachaar kiya he
 Amit Shah said that it is an unholy alliance
 janadesh ke khilaaf jakarcongress ne jedies ko samarthan diya he or janadesh ke khilaaf jaakar hi jedies ne samarthan liya he
 He said that the leaders of both the parties used to know what each other did before the elections
 sansthaaon ke liye jagaa congress kaa bharosacongress par hamalaa karte hue amit shah ne kaha ki is chunaav ke baad sabase acchhee baat yah rahi he ki ab congress ke man main loktantric sansthaaon ke prati aasthaa bad gai he
 Now Congress has started talking about the honor of the Supreme Court to the Election Commission
 ham chaahate hai ki haarane par bhi congress apana yahi ravaiya barkaraar rakhegi, aisi ummid he
 the Court has shown strictness towards the kalyan-dombivili Municipal Corporation due to its failure in disposal of garbage and waste
 saal 2009 main kaustubh gokhale naam ke ek shaks ne kalyaan-dombivili main kooday-kachare ke niptaare main prashaskeey asafalataa ko lekar ek janhit yachika daayar kii thi
 It was also claimed in the petition that the Aadharwadi dumping ground in Kalyan is illegal, due to which the Ulhas river is getting polluted, affecting the health of nearly one lakh people
 faisle se gokhale kaaphi kush hai, enditivi se baatcheet main unhone kaha, 'court ne aadesh main rihaishi sahit saare nirmaan ko philhal band karne kaa aadesh diya he, saath hi rajya sarkaar se kaha he ki wo kaam ke liye nirdesh de
 The next hearing in the case is on May 5, let's see what happens
 'kediemasi kamishnar madhukar andhad, ne faisle ke baad kaha ki hamane fouran karrwai shuru kii he, cameti banaai he kachra vyavasthaapan ke liye
 Action will also be taken against those who have been negligent in their work

 His way of 'send off' to Aamir Sohail in the match against Pakistan is still fresh in the minds of the fans

 uttarapradesh me duusare charan ke ain pehle party ke pradesh adhyaksh suresh niranjan ne samaajawaadee party ko samarthan dene kaa ekatarfa elaan kar diya tha
 JCU national general secretary KC Tyagi had earlier denied any such support but the party had stayed the action

 Suresh Niranjan, who is adamant about this, may have taken action but Suresh Niranjan is adamant on supporting SP with his supporters and is telling his state working committee with his decision
 nitish kumarasapa or congress se khaase naaraaz bataae ja rahe hai
 It is believed that the SP Congress had hijacked the alliance that Nitish had tried to lay the foundation of before and the JDU was not given any place in that alliance, even in that Samajwadi Party without taking Nitish Kumar into confidence His state unit had also supported this alliance

 Viewers arrived at the Eden Gardens with the hopes of Sachin Tendulkar's great century and saw a more composed innings with Rahul Dravid's bat here, which helped India move towards a strong score in the first innings of the second Test cricket match against the West Indies
 tendulkar to mahaj 38 ran banaakar pavilion laut gayi lekin dravid ne ek chor sanbhale rakhaa or 119 ran banaaye
 In the last eight matches of Mr
 Bhavishy, with the help of fifth century and half-centuries from VVS Laxman (73 not out) and Gautam Gambhir (65), India scored 346 for five by the end of the first day's play
 dilli main pehla test match jitkar teen match kii series main 1-0 se aage chal rahe bharat ne din ke antim kshanon main chaar gend ke andar do wicket ganvaaye
 These include the wicket of Dravid who also became the first victim of Craig Braithwaite's career
 isse vaapasi kii ummid karne vaale westeindies ke liye iske alaava tendulkar kaa wicket bhi sakaaratmak pahalu rahaa jinka shatakon kaa shatak puraa karne kaa intjaar bad gaya
 Tendulkar, who came to the crease after Gambhir's dismissal, flowed from the start but when he was batting in full rhythm, West Indies leg-spinner Devendra Bishoo delivered the ball which left the entire stadium silent
 bishu kii vah short pich gend thi jise tendulkar ne pul karke midwicket par khadey malaren sampuls ko aasaan kaich thamaya
 He played 71 balls in his innings and hit five fours
 westeindies kaa anubhavheen akraman dravid par prabhaav nahin chhod paaya
 He completed the 36th of his career, the fifth of this year and the fourth century at the Eden Gardens, sending Kemar Roach's Noble for four runs at square leg
 unki is pari kii khaasiyat yah rahi ki unhone is bich bishu or sampuls kii gendon par chakke bhi jade
 The Caribbean team got the invaluable wicket of Dravid when it seemed that Dravid and Laxman would be able to prolong their partnership
 derren saimi ne nayi gend nahin lee or apane kaamchalau gendbaaj brathwet ko gend saunp di
 Laxman welcomed him with a four, but his last ball of the next over was taken with a good turn and Dravid's off stump was blown
 bharat ne iske baad ishanth sharma ko nitwachaman ke rup main bheja lekin westeindies ne turant hi nayi gend le lee
 The third ball of Roach's over was the bouncer, on which Ishant caught the back of the wicket
 iske baad din kaa khel samaapt kar diya gaya
 Dhoni, who often lost the toss in Test matches, was lucky in the coin bounce in the morning and also decided to bat first
 gambhir or virendra sahvaag ne subah pehle wicket ke liye 66 ran kii saajhedaari kii
 At the beginning of the innings, Sehwag's helmet hit the ball but it did not affect him and he played a stormy knock of 38 runs with the help of eight fours in 33 balls
 eden ke 67000 kshamta vaale stadium main subah lagbhag 1000 darshakon ke saamne sahvaag ne apana naiysargik khel dikhaaya
 Sammy bowled a new ball due to Ravi Rampal being unwell but Sehwag kept him specially targeted but in the end he got his wicket off the same bowler's normal ball
 gambhir ne pravaahamay ballebaaji karke test cricket main 17waan ardhashatak puraa kiya lekin unhone fidel edwards kii gend par dhilaa shaat khelkar short cover par khadey adrian barath ko aasaan kaich thamaya

 dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ke khilaaf daakhil aapraadhik manahani cese main rouj avenue court ne apana faisla surakshit rakh liya he
 The court will now decide on July 10 whether to issue summons to Kejriwal as an accused in the case
 arvind kejariwal ne sitambar 2018 main bijepi ke netaaon ke khilaaf aapattijanak twit kiya tha
 Against which a complaint of criminal defamation was filed in the court by lawyer Rajesh Kumar
 shikayatakarta rajesh kumaar ne aaj (shanivaar) adaalat main apana bayaan darj kara diya he
 Rajesh Kumar, convenor of bjp's Purvanchal Morcha's legal cell, accused Kejriwal of tweeting 'objectionable / defamatory' posts against BJP leaders
 yah shikaayat adishnal chif metropolitan magistrate samar vishaal ke saamne kii gai he
 Rajesh Kumar told the court that he was surprised to see a tweet by Kejriwal, which wrote that BJP leaders continue to rape Hindu girls around the country
 rajesh kumaar ne court main kaha he ki kejariwal ne 30 sitambar 2018 ko jo twit kiya tha usase unhen bahut dukh pahunchaa he
 Kejriwal wrote, "BJP leaders roam Hindu girls all over the country
 
 He said that he wanted to file a complaint at the same time but thought that nobody would take his tweet seriously
 shikayatakarta ne kaha ki twit ke aadhaar par kai maukon par logon ne mulaakaat ke vakt unhen sharminda kiya he
 Rajesh Kumar even said in his petition in the court that after this tweet, the woman of the society also taunted him
 shikayatakarta ne kaha he ki hanuman jayanti ke din, unki socity main ek mahila ne yah jaanakar ki vah bijepi netaa hai, kejariwal ke twit kaa hawala dete hue unpar taana maaraa
 Rajesh Kumar said, Kajriwal, who occupies such a high position in the system, has made many such irresponsible and defamatory tweets which have repeatedly embarrassed the complainant
 is maamle main kejariwal par manahani kaa maamla banataa he isliye court main unhone kejariwal par manahani kaa cese kiya he
 Now the confrontation has come to the fore
 pichley 30 saal main sabase bade bahumat ke saath sarkaar banane vaali bhartiya janata party (bijepi) or bamushkil chaar saal puraani tathaa loksabhaa main mahaj chaar siton ke baavjood dilli main apratyaashit janadesh hasil kar chuki aam aadmi party (aap) ke bich lagaataar chal rahe bhadde or apmanjanak takaraav ko ab kuch hafte hone ko aa rahe hai
 This relationship has not always been very special and anyway Arvind Kejriwal has never missed the first target on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, no matter what the chance
 modi bhi in sabase kabhi upar nahin rahe
 Two years ago he called Arvind Kejriwal a Pakistani agent, AK-49
 pichley saal kejariwal ne modi ko manorogi or kaayar kah diya tha
 Since then till date this raga has spread like this without any reform, where even the slightest spark on Twitter keeps the fire of debate
 june main dilli ke bhrashtachar nirodhak beuro ne jab kejariwal ke khilaaf 400 karod ru
 Kejriwal filed an unconfirmed FIR in the water tanker scam, while Kejriwal tweeted expressing happiness that Modi has now accepted that there is a direct war between the two
 
 '' jaahir he, yah jang bemail hi hogi kyonki ek kii chaati kathith taur par 56 inch kii he
 It is a different matter that in the matter of which Kejriwal eats, he compensates for his quarrelsome mood
 agle saal kii shuruyaat main aap punjab or goa main chunaav ladegi
 Both states have NDA governments
 punjab main kiye gaye shuruaati surveykshan bataate hai ki aap jeet kii raah par he or vah 17 maah pehle dilli vaala nateeja vahaan doharaa sakati he
 For example, in a survey by huffpost-sevoter, AAP has shown between 94 and 100 seats in the 117-seat assembly
 baaki duusare surveykshanon main bhi aap ko 85 se 100 ke bich siten milti dikhaai ja rahi hai
 Kejriwal has already claimed that AAP will win 35 out of the 40 seats in Goa
 party ko ummid he ki punjab or goa se endie ke patan kii shuruyaat hogi, jo aage chalakar gujarat, himachal pradesh, madhya pradesh or karnataka main chunaav kii jameen taiyaar karegaa
 The party feels that in the next two years, with the hope of these elections, it will be transformed from a small Delhi-centric party to a large national party and will gain the appropriate strength for the Lok Sabha elections in 2019
 congress ke nirantar patan ke saath aap ab bijepi ke mukhya vipakshi dal ke taur par ubhar rahi he
 Kejriwal is already assuming this
 kejariwal ke bhaashanon main ek baat baar-baar aati he ki modi jab videsh daure par nahin hote hai to raat bhar jagakar aap ke patan ke liye sajeesh rachate rahete hai
 The basis of his argument is that it is not so, then why is the Modi government behind the AAP government of Delhi, which already has to share its power with the civic bodies, the Lt
 Governor and the Center? According to AAP, there are all-round conspiracies against him
 patrkaar se aap ke rashtriya pravaktaa bane ashutosh ne india today ko bataaya, ''pichley ekaadh hafte main hamaare khilaaf hue tamaam hamale siyaasi ranjish kaa nateeja hai
 BJP and Modi are scared of aap's lead
 desh main aakhir koun-sa vipaksh bachaa he? ham iklauta dal hai jo modi se lard rahe hai
 "joseph Heller's point is right here that you are in a fad, so he will not leave you
" satta se takaraavhaal kaa record dekhen
 The bjp-led central government returned all 14 bills passed by the Delhi government, including an AAP ambitious Jan Lokpal anti-corruption bill, as the "process was not followed

 What else is this double standard? When Kejriwal was on a three-day tour of Punjab last week, the CBI paid his principal secretary Rajendra Kumar Rs 50 crore
 ke bhrasht len-dein ke maamle main giraftaar kar liya
 Rajendra Kumar is an IAS and is accused of having done deals in favor of a private company from 2007, in which he also owns a partial stake
 ek press conference main up-mukhyamantri manish sisodiya or ashutosh ne is giraftaar ko siyaasi ranjish bataaya
 a few days ago, Sisodia and 51 AAP mlas were taken into custody on their way to the Prime Minister's residence
 aisa sisodiya ke khilaaf hui ek shikaayat ke baad kiya gaya jisamen unke upar ''kaarobaariyon ko dhamkaane'' kaa aarope lagaaya gaya tha
 a day earlier, an MLA named Dinesh Mohaniya was arrested from a press conference on charges of assault and assault

 Vijay Kumar Garg, the man arrested on charges of tearing the Quran, gave a statement that he had received instructions from Yadav to do so
 pichley loksabhaa chunaav main aap ke saansad pratyaashee or vakil himmat shergill kaa kahana he ki ''in farji aaropon ko sabit karne ke liye koi video yaa recording maujuud nahin he
 He admitted that the two are familiar with each other but said that nothing proves this
 punjab ke daure par ek raily main kejariwal ne kaha ki pichley ek dashak se satta par kabiz akali-bijepi ke gathjod ne unke daure main baadha daalane ke liye or 'ghinauni sajishein' rachi hai
 Kejriwal said that Garg was described as a Vishwa Hindu Parishad man at the time of his arrest

 "next stop" After landing from the Punjabi ship, Kejriwal, like any other aspiring leader, first went to the Golden Temple

 These workers were people with good vision, who were probably kept so that they could save Kejriwal from the eyes of the common man and the media

 They were taken inside the temple and people gathered around them like bees

 This place was interesting for any leader of the common man
 kuch dinon pehle kejariwal goa main the jahaan se bal main phulon kaa haar lagaae unki ajeebogareeb tasviir viral hui thi
 This was his second visit to the state
 pehali yatra main unhone ek raily kii thi, jiskaa uddeshy goa ko kejariwal se or unhen goa se parichit karwaanaa tha
 Joe Gomes, a member of the AAP campaign committee, said, "goa will survive
" goa kii viraasat, goa kii samskruti, goa kii asmita, sab kuch aam aadmi ke sahare batch jaaegi

 You still managed to awaken this sentiment

 a rally was to be held that evening in which a manifesto of AAP was to be issued for the stray youth of the state

 The attitude of the crowd gathered there was absolutely rebellious

 '' punjab main agar haar hui, to vah na sirf bada jhatka sabit hogi balki 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main uski ummiido par pani pher degi
 Apparently, the Lok Sabha elections are still three years later and as former British Prime Minister Harald Wilson said, one week is a long time in politics
 yah baat alag he ki bhrashtachar or satta virdohi maahaul kaa saamana kar rahe punjab or goa aap ke liye philhal anukool hai
 If you could not win in at least one of the two, especially in Punjab, then it would mean that people still did not have confidence in the party's concept of swaraj and participatory direct democracy at the national level
 jahaan tak party kaa sawaal he, desh bhar main chunaav laduya hameshaa se uske agenda main rahaa he
 Resignation after ruling in Delhi for seven agonizing weeks, and the ambition in 2014 to contest more than 400 Lok Sabha seats unfairly, created a public perception about AAP

 Kejriwal's defeat was better than other AAP candidates in the sense that his bail was not forfeited
 loksabhaa chunaav se sabak lete hue kejariwal ne pichley saal apane shapath grahan samaaroh main ''ahankaar'' se chetaya tha
 a month after this speech, Kejriwal reiterated that AAP will not be stuck in the elections of other states
 ve bole, ''main koi nepolian nahin hum
 "there were many people within his party who felt that the energy gained from the victory in Delhi should be used elsewhere
" kejariwal ne unhen niraash kiya
 This thing has been spent barely a year and AAP has thrown itself into the electoral arena of two states
 aap kii rashtriya yojanaon par india today dwaara bheje sawaalon kaa kejariwal ne koi jawaab nahin diya
 Various party sources tried to reach him in Punjab as well but he made no comment
 punjab main unhone media kii ore se koi sawaal nahin liya
 Ashutosh said on the phone from the small party, big strategy Goa, that "the party is not fighting elections only to contest elections

 "talwar calls himself a" student of the electoral equation "
 unka kahana tha ki punjab or goa ke paar dekhnaa sirf ''atakalbaaji'' he kyonki party ko ''booth str par chunaavon kii taiyaari karne main'' aath maheene se ek saal tak kaa samay lag jayega or uske paas paryaapt kaaryakarta bhi nahin hai jo daravaaje-daravaaje jaakar jamini str par prachaar kar saken
 Durgesh Pathak, aap's grassroots troublemaker, highlighted the statistics related to the promotion of Punjab, "even though we had won four seats in Punjab alone, but at the organizational level, our position there is extremely Was bad '' unhen ''rajya bhar main ghumkar 9,000 kaaryakartaaon ke saath baithak karke party kaa dhaancha khadaa karne main'' 50 din lag gaye

 People see Kejriwal as the driver of positive change
 talwaar ke mutabik punjab main chunaav ladgaye kaa faisla lenaa ''kaaphi aasaan rahaa
 According to Pathak, even though there were factions and conflicts within the AAP organization in Punjab, it did not make any difference to the party's appeal
 ashutosh, pankaj gupta or dialog and deveopment kamishan ke upaadhyaksh ashish khetaan sabhi ne apane-apane tareeke se samajhaayaa ki party ko yahaan chunaav ladgaye main apane liye anukool kya dikh rahaa he
 You consider yourself in an ideal position in states where it is the third option
 khetaan kehete hai, ''haal ke chunaavon main matadaataaon ke paas jahaan teesraa vikalp rahaa he, unhone bijepi or congress ke badale use tarjeeh di he
 "this does not apply in states where local parties are strong, such as West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh
" punjab main adhiktar congress or akali-bijepi kaa raaj rahaa he
 Both have come to power alternately

 The Congress is a tired option despite the popularity of its state president, Captain Amarinder Singh

 "besides, the population situation there, the largest number of Dalit voters in any state and the huge population of rural youth living in lack of work is in favor of AAP

 Despite the anger against the akali-bjp and apathy towards the Congress, traditional parties still have ample time to contest the elections

" amarinder singh ke vishwaas kii jad main logon ke saath unka kareebi rishta he
 In the initial surveys, despite the positive atmosphere of AAP, a warning may be there for him, that is that aap's image is dependent on Kejriwal's appeal
 amarinder chaahe kitne bhi lokapriy hon, lekin mukhyamantri kii baat aate hi logon ne kejariwal ko surveykshanon main pehle sthaan par rakhaa he or amarinder ko duusare par bhej diya
 In third place is Sukhbir Singh Badal who has got only seven percent votes
 media main ek ajeebogareeb afvaah yah ud rahi he ki chunaav ke kareeb aate hi kejariwal ko punjab ke mukhyamantri pad kaa pratyaashee ghoshit kar diya jayega
 All the leaders of AAP spoke to this rumor, India Today
 kejariwal ko ab bhi 'bhagoda shabd yaad hoga or ve apni vishwasaneeyata ko nahin khona chahenge
 Here, there is also a leadership crisis in AAP for Punjab because no one other than Kejriwal is visible

 False morning? Yogendra Yadav, who created the Swaraj Abhiyan, a political movement for most of your rebels, is stunned as soon as you are mentioned as "substitute"
 ek aalekh main unhone likhaa tha ki ''aap kii chunavi kamyaabi se aisa abhas hua ki vikalp vyaavhaarik ho saktaa he or acchhee cheez bhi prabhaav main aa sakati he
 For this reason, an unusual kind of craze is being seen all over the country regarding this new party, which has actually been successful in one city only
 ''haalanki shiv vishvanathan kaa maananaa he ki aap ke bare main sabase dilachasp cheez uskaa behad saamaanya hona he

 John Stratton Hawley comes up with a similar setting in his book 'bhakti ke three tones: Meera, Sur, Kabir'
 is pustak ke aarambh main hi jon striton hauli ne ise ‘aitihaasik tark or vivek ke prati apil’ kaha he
 He emphasizes the creativity of these three greatest poets included in his book and the importance of imaginative, critical dialogue over their time
 aise samvaad, jin ke bina bhakthi-samvednaa kaa samvedansheel adhyayan asambhav he
 Hawali in his book considers specific questions related to Meera, Sur and Kabir - time, authenticity of the compositions, nature of sensation, their place in public memory, etc
, in the pretext of broad questions related to devotion and sensation
 Let's review

 John Stratton Hawley once said about his book that i first wanted to work on Surdas but when i came in contact with Purushottam Agarwal, i grew curious about Meera and Kabir and i Started working for aaj iskaa parinaam aapke saamne he

 Read the literature on Kabir Jayanti on Aaj Tak, written by John Stratton Houli, edited by Purshottam Agarwal and written by Ashok Kumar on the book 'bhakti ke Teen Swar: Meera, Sur, Kabir' written on Sant Kabir
 Excerpts: Three notes of devotion: Meera, Sur Kabir was Kabir? There is no way of knowing who Kabir was other than the history of accepting Kabir
 ham dekh chuke hai ki yah itihaas sanyog se, dhundhala nahin he lekin yah ek moolbhoot samasya liye hue he
 Even if we assume that the original sources of the invoice are in the oral tradition that is older than its manuscripts, what will we do to the fact that the western and eastern traditions do not match the poems of a group whose dictionary we ' Real 'kabir's representative
 yah hameshaa uljhan main daalega, or jab ham kabir ke jivan se judi kinvadantiyon par najar daalate hai to or bhi ulajhanein paidaa hoti hai
 These legends emerged in the last years of the 16th century
 beshak aise log bhi hai jo kehete hai ki ve unki aawaaj kii dhwani pahachaanate hai
 The great scholar Hazariprasad Dwivedi of the mid-20th century is a good example of this
 unhone kabir kaa bhaktivaala rup prastut kiya jise kai logon ne sweekaar kiya
 Dwivedi said that his personality was shaped by the education of Swami Ramanand, a Brahmin social reformer
 duusare log bhi guru kii aawaaj kii dhwani ko pahachaanate hai
 Famous singer of Kabir's songs, the blind Rajasthani artist Birjapuri Maharaj says, "if a speech has a deeper meaning then it would be Kabir; If it is not, then it is just duplication
 ' durbhaagya se, in geeton ke gayan se jo kabir ubharate hai, ve dvivedi ji ke kabir se kaaphi alag hai
 Therefore, as a scholar has said, it would not be enough to say that we should take 'kabir' in his words and references only
 ' kaune-se bol? koun-se sandarbh?ham swami ramanand se hi shuru karen, kyonki kabir ko unhen paribhaashit karanevaali vansh-parampara se jodne ke liye ve bahut mahatvapurn hai
 The comical story of Ramanand initiating Kabir is a central element of his culture
 kahani yah he ki ramanand gangasnan karne ja rahe the tabhi kabir ne aisa kuch kiya ki ve kabir se takaraa gaye
 Ramanand's mouth burst: 'ram! - Kabir accepted it as the mantra of initiation
 thakur ne kshitimohan sen dwaara uplabdh karai gai kavitaaon kaa anuwaad karte hue ek kavita main ramanand ko paaya or isane unhen aashwast kar diya ki guru-shishy kaa sambandh ek aitihaasik tathy he
 But it is a pity that the study of the old manuscripts does not reveal this poem, nor does Ramanand find its name in any other old poem, while it is to be expected that if he were so important to Kabir, So they would have been mentioned in some poem
 kabir ke gahan jaankaar purushottam agarwal tathaa david lorengen yadhyapi isse asahmat hai, mujhe is judaav ko santcharit se punerjeevit karne kaa koi rasta nahin sujhata
 Ramanand solves many problems with very little evidence
 ve us tuuti kadi ko thama dete hai, jo kabir ke banarsi 'purvi- naastik paksh ko us aastik bhaktivaadee vyaktitv se jodatii he jo sudur pashchim main ubhari pandulipiyon main vyapak rup se upasthit he
 He establishes Kabir in a specific monastic tradition — the Ramanandi tradition — as well as the formula for his background of the Muslim family, as is evident from his name
 or phir baad main unhen us tarah kii bhakthi ke saath dharmantaran se bhi jodate hai, jise kuch brahman to apana kehete hi hai
 All of this is quite neat, and there is very little echo in the poems
 mujhe to nichali jati ke un aalochakon kaa saath dena padegaa, jo yah maanate hai ki ramanand tathaa kabir ke bich sampark mahaj ek pavitrataavaadi hastkshep tha- kabir ko apni jadon se kaatane kaa tarika
 The portrait of Kabir in his work 'bhaktamala' by Nabhadas in about 1600 is far more reliable
 vaise, ve bhi vaishnavvaad ke prati patibaddh hai or khaas kar ramandi bhi hai
 It is true that in the general list that Nabdas presents, he records Kabir among Ramanand's disciples, but is free from all sectarian leanings when he talks about them directly
 ve kehete hai ki kabir ne jatigat bhedbhaavon ko paribhaashit karanevaale brahmanvaadi sutron ke saath hi 'yuktisangat darshan kii chah dhaaraon tathaa is vichaar ko bhi khaarij kar diya tha ki manushya ke jivan ko ek nishchit kram kaa paalan karnaa hi chahie
 These were the foundations of the Varnashram religion, which became the central elements of classical Brahminical thought
 nabhadas ke anusaar, kabir asahmati ke swar the
 If there is no devotion, it is completely opposite to true religion
 ve jis manyata ke liye pahachaane jate hai, vah yah he ki sangathit dharm nirarthak he
 According to Blai, the most important thing is 'bhakti' 'intensity'
 samaaj main unki jo sthiti thi, uske kaaran yah koi aashcharya kii baat nahin he ki kabir yahi rukh apanaate, or nabhadas ke mutabik gaur karanevaali baat yah he ki unke liye jati kaa koi mahatva nahin tha
 As we do not know from just a few poems, they were Muslim weavers, which is very low in terms of status
 isliye, achraj nahin ki unki jaisi sthiti main pade samudaay unhen prabhaavshaalee maane
 Among his admirers are Jats, Punjabi farmers who are the vertebrates of the Sikh community and who claim themselves to be outside the purview of Varnashram religion
 lekin ham yah na bhoolen ki kai duusare logon- beshak vaishnavon tathaa brahmanon tak- ne is aahvaan ko suna
 An important formula that emerges from the early compilations of Kabir's poems fades because of the contexts in which they are presented, and he needs to be credited before leaving the 'history' Kabir
 naathon ke naam se khyath yogiyon ke samudaay ke prati kabir kaa yah buniyadi rin he
 The learning of this community takes an approach to the technique of physical transformation, which is often present in the poems of Kabir
 yah hathyog he- sakht shaareerik anushaasan ke liye kadaa yoga
 Blai clearly admits that he has not touched this dimension
 ise ve 'shakti urja kaa sampoorn vishay' ('da hole matter of shakti inerjee) bataate hai
 Nevertheless, as a system of thought and behavior (which Kabir never associated with power), it serves as a key element in making sense of religious and figurative security (which we have always associated with his name)
 iskaa ahsaas karne ke liye ham phir se pracheenatam dinaankit pandulipi ko dekhen
 In it, we read about a well which is inverted: Do not take my life for a long time
 P
 Kabir 'dubhar pania bharni na jaai' pankti se shuru honevaali kavita nishchit hi ant:kshepit veery ke bare main sanket kar rahi he, jise yogakriya, sambhavat: tantric kriya ke dwaara mastishk kii ore kshepit kiya gaya he
 Since the force of gravity is not affected by this fluid, it cannot be pulled by the gyanendris (five panihari), and this is why 'panihari' gets frustrated
 yah drav rahasyamay dhang se baari he, yah sharir ko kabje main kar letaa he
 It seems that Kabir knows the entire routine of Nath yogis - controlling Kundalini energies and feeling happiness in this state - at least orally - everything is known
 iske baad aashcharya prakat hota he
 In the end they say that they will not drink this water
 kya ve charam anand or veery skhalan se inkaar kar rahe hai, jaisaaki tantric log karte hai? nahin, shabd to aisa nahin kah rahe hai; balki ve yah kah rahe hai ki ve gur upades ko maanane se inkaar kar rahe hai
 They, as Nath Yogi is saying, are refusing to believe that: Kumbha is burnt in Gagan Mandal where there is a place for Amrit
 sagura hoi su bhari bhari pivai nigura jaai piyasa
 
 
 Kabir will either follow Ram or Gobind
 praarambhik pandulipiyon se praapt kavitaaon main ham kai baar is kabir se rou-ba-rou hote hai- ek diggaj se, jo shaareerik rup se sakriy hai, ek hathyogi hai, phir bhi jo apni pahchaan apane antar main based sookshm guru se jodate hai, sachche guru ram / gobind se
 It is the devotional text of the Nath Yogi base — a form of spontaneity, spontaneity, and honesty, which is much simpler than the product of physical fluid engineering that serves its primary metaphor
 anushaasan kaa yah rup- kam-se-kam apane aap main ek lakshya- unke liye nahin he
 Not surprisingly, they can speak about the yogis who live in the streets of Banaras: Ka nangain ka cham jau nahin chinasahi atamramanange re jog jau hoi bana ki mirga mukuti gaya koi mundo bent bari siddhi hoi sargahin bhirand koi kabindu rahi bari jaari tari bhai Why is Khusrai the ultimate speed pie, Kabir Sunoun rai bhai Ram nam bin kin siddhi pai

 In fact, all the existing parties of the alliance are singing their own voice
 haal ye he ki sarkaar gathan ke saath hi dalon ke bich aapasi talmail ke liye ek kaaman minimum program banaaya gaya tha, lekin aisa kuch dikhaa nahin
 At the time of forming the government, Hemant Soren had ordered all the departments of the state to work by preparing a 100-day action plan, but after 100 days, the government department could not make any plan even after implementation
 aise main pehle se hi ghotaalon or bhrashtachar se trast rajya janata behaal he

 In response to a question asked on the Food Security Bill of the Central Government, he said that this bill is very good for a backward state like Jharkhand
 is bill ke babat vibhaagon se rivyuu bhi liye gaye he, jo kaaphi utsahvardhak he or ise jald hi amal main laayaa jaayegaa
 On the question of difficulties in running a coalition government, Hemant Soren said, "there is nothing like this but people have made it difficult to run because of their selfishness
" ham kaaman minimum program ke tahat hi kaam kar rahe he
 The government talks at the government level, while the political talk is resolved through mutual interaction between the parties

 Cinema owners in Pakistan may remove the ban on the screening of Indian films on Monday, which was imposed amidst growing tension between the two countries after the Uri terror attack

 According to lashari, cinema owners and exhibitors had avoided screening of Indian films at their level and this was not a ban
 film udyog ke sutron ne kaha ki jab puraani or naeepakistani filmon or nai hollywood filmembhi haul bharne main naakaam raheen to cinema maalik or bhartiya filmon ke ayatak pareshaan ho gaye the
 "A private media group is currently trying to bring a riot to Pakistan and release it," a source said

 The Indian team finished 12th and final in this way, which is the eight-time champion's most useless performance in the Olympics
 bhartiya team ne landan main apana prayek match ganvaaya
 This was the first time in the Olympics that India could not win any matches
 isse pehle olympic main team kaa sabase bekaar pradarshan 1996 atlanta olympic main tha
 She was then ranked eighth
 iske alaava bharat beijing olympic 2008 ke liye kwalifai nahin kar paaya tha
 Andrew Cronje scored a goal in the eighth minute for South Africa to give his team an edge
 sandip singh ne 14wein minute penlti carnor par gol karke bharat ko barabari dilaayi
 Timothy Drummond scored a field goal in the 34th minute to put South Africa ahead 2–1 at halftime
 lid noris jones ne antim hooter bajane se paanch minute pehle yah 3-1 kar diya

 At that time too, India finished last in the 12-team tournament
 tab plyaaf main use pakistan ne haraaya tha
 It was expected that the Indian team, which is considered the weakest of the tournament, will try to avoid coming in last place by performing well against South Africa but again the defense and weaknesses of the front line came out
 yah pehla avasar he jabaki bharat olympic jaise kisi bade toornament main dakshin africa ke haathon parajeet hua
 India got four penalty corners in the match, scoring only one
 usne iske alaava das shaat gol par jamaaye lekin inamen se keval ek par hi gol ho paaya
 On the other hand, South Africa attacked the Indian goal 11 times and was successful in scoring three times
 bharat landan olympic main ek bhi match nahin jeet paaya
 He was defeated in Group b by Holland 3–2, New Zealand 3–1, Germany 5–2, South Korea 4–1 and Belgium 3–0

 iske baad sarkaar ne nirnay liya he ki puraane niyam ke anusaar hi baaluu kaa khanan hoga
 The Chief Secretary said that illegal mining and illegal storage of sand will be banned and no more than 100 hectares of mining lease will be granted
 saath hi jise pehle se hi 100 hectare se zyada kaa tender mila he un par koi roak nahin hogi
 The RJD had announced a Bihar bandh on Thursday against the same mining policy
 lekin sarkaar ke is niti ke waapas lene kii vajah se band kaa shaayad hi asar ho
 Former Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Yadav also said that if the government withdraws the new policy, then they will withdraw the decision of Bihar bandh
 gauratlab he ki patna hoicourt ne bihar sarkaar ke baaluu, gitti or mitti ke khanan, bikri or parivahan ke liye banaae gaye nai niyamon par philhal roak laga di thi
 The court was ordered to work under the old rules

 Amit Shah said that whenever there was any interference about citizenship, it was done to solve some specific problem
 uganda se jab log aae the to keval vahaan se aae logon ko hi naagarikta di gai, kisi desh se aenagarikon ko naagarikta nahin di gai
 Amit Shah said that the interpretation of our minorities is not wrong
 yah puraa vidheyak un teen deshon ke alpsankhyakon ke liye he

 The victim is a refugee, not an intruder

 Amit Shah said that those who want to give shelter to intruders for vote bank, we will not let them succeed

 The Rohingya will never be accepted
 rohingya bangladesh ke jariye bharat aate hai
 Amit Shah said that in 1947, 23 percent of Hindus were in Pakistan, but in the year 2011, this figure 3
 4 fisadi rah gaya

 vahiin bharat main alpsankhyakon kii aabaadi badi he
 India will not remain silent on the minorities of neighboring countries
 jo bharat ke mul naagarik hai unhen koi khatra nahin
 At the same time, no Muslim in this country has anything to do with the bill
 modi ke piem rahete hue desh kaa samvidhan hi hamaara dharm he
 The needy has been getting citizenship Amit Shah, referring to the Parsi community, said that Parsis also came to India after being tortured

 congress par shah kaa tangamit shah ne kaha ki main janata ko kahana chahta hum ki congress aisi bin sampradayik party he, jisaki kerala main muslim lig sahyogi he or maharashtra main shivasena sahyogi he
 i want to assure this House again that when we bring NRC, not a single intruder will be able to escape inside this country
 amit shah ne kaha ki log bill ke khilaaf maahaul bana rahe hai lekin kisi ko bhi darane kii jarurat nahin he
 Whether the refugees have ration cards or not, this bill will give citizenship to everyone
 aapako kisi ke bahekaave main aane kii jarurat nahin he

 Mahinda Rajapaksa's decade in Sri Lanka ended on Friday
 ve adhikarik ghar 'temple treez' se baahar aa gaye
 He lost the presidential election by four lakh votes
 yah paraajay mili do maheene pehle tak sahyogi rahe maitreepala sirisena se
 Let us know why the people rejected Rajapaksa who liberated this island nation from the terror of LTTE: 1
 tamil or muslimon kaa ekatarfa virodh
 During the LTTE annihilation in 2008, Rajapaksa was accused of killing the Tamils in his knowledge
 iske baad desh main kai bahusankhyak singhli or musalamaanon ke bich dange hue
 Many Muslims were killed, but the Singhalese rioters did not take action
 en chunaav se pehle sarkaar kaa hissaa rahe muslim or tamil netaaon ne rajpakshe se kinaaraa kar liya
 In such a situation, the minorities took fierce revenge from Rajapaksa
 unke khilaaf vot dekar
 2
 rajpakshe kii sarkaar main sabase zyada taqatvar unka parivaar tha
 One brother was handling the defense and the other was the economic ministry, while the third brother was the Speaker of the Parliament
 rajpakshe ke putr namal saansad rahe, lekin unhen rajpakshe ke uttaradhikari hone kaa hi sammaan praapt tha
 This brother-nepotism was a novelty to other colleagues of the government, the glimpse of it was also visible in the people
 3
 Anger over Rajapaksa's dictatorial attitude

 bihar kii rajdhani patna main jalajmav ke bahaane mukhyamantri nitish kumaar (nitish Kumar)ko jitna vipakshi rashtriya janata dal (rajd) kii aalochana kaa saamana nahin karnaa pad rahaa he usase kahin adhik aalochana unako apane sahyogi bhaajapa ke netaaon kii jhelni pad rahi he jiskaa netritv kendriya mantri giriraaj singh (giriraj Singh) kar rahe hai
 So far, Union Minister Giriraj Singh, on the pretext of water logging, has been putting jijan on social media every day from his voice in criticism of Nitish Kumar
 singh ke samarthak unhen mukhyamantri ke rup main dekhnaa chaahate hai
 So Giriraj Singh feels that he can fulfill his dream of life by targeting Nitish Kumar and Sushil Modi
 isliye unhone vidrohi tevar akhtiyaar kiya hua he
 On the other hand, now the city development minister Suresh Sharma has also dismissed his responsibilities by saying that even the city commissioner does not listen to him
 lekin isse purv jab patna kii meyar sita sahu ne ek sanvadata sammelan kar apni zimmevary se bhaagane kii koshish kii to wo chaal ulti pad gai kyonki unka betaa har jawaab peeche se de rahaa tha or jab media waalon ne poocha ki akhir kitne pump karaab hai or kitna paisa karch hua to wo baglein jhaank rahi thim
 Most of the BJP mlas are also avoiding the media
 haalanki janata dal united ne nitish kumaar ke bachaav main saafe kar diya he ki jab nagar vikaas vibhaag aapke paas he, vidhayak va meyar sab aapke tab mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ko zimmevaar kaise tehraaya ja saktaa he
 Experts believe that every leader and activist of BJP knows that after water logging there is a lot of anger among the government and its public representatives
 aise main nitish ko nishane par rakhkar logon kaa dhyaan bhatakaane kii koshish ho rahi he ki adhikari to hamaari sunate hi nahin the
 But even the BJP leaders themselves believe that if there were meetings in the name of city development and in which there were only BJP people and ministers, then there was Haribhajan
 doosraa bhaajapa kaa ek tabaqa maanata he ki nitish ke bahaane giriraaj, sanjay jaiswal, sanjay paswan jaise netaa ye sandesh dene kii koshish kar rahe hai ki ab wo susheel modi kii nahin sunate
 There is an age-old tradition in the Bihar BJP to challenge its top leader
 jaise kailashpati mishra ko inder singh namdhari yaa tarakant jha chunauti dete the
 Govindacharya then extended Sushil Modi, Nand Kishore Yadav and Saryu Rai
 lekin bhaajapa ke netaa maanate hai ki giriraaj jaise nitish or susheel modi ko ek saath nishane par rakh rahe hai to bihar ke pichde voter kaa centement nitish ke saath utani hi majbooti ke saath jutegaa
 At the same time, the leaders of Janata Dal United say that the government has definitely suffered the biggest setback due to water logging, but due to this extreme confidence and not monitoring properly every day in the city development department, such a bad situation has happened
 in netaaon kaa maananaa he ki har kaami or har chiz kaa shrey lene ke chakkar main bhaajapa ke netaa nishchit rup se jaldbaazi dikhaa rahe hai
 As far as criticism by Giriraj and other leaders is concerned, he says that Nitish Kumar has faced abuses and opposition from the caste he comes from in 2010 and 2015 and the election results show that the result for Nitish Kumar is favorable

 sarkaar kaa tark he ki bakreed ke tyohaar ke din modi ko raily karne kii ijaajat nahin di ja sakati
 After this, BJP leaders are fixing the day of October 19 or 20 for Modi's rally and now the Railways have put a 'break'
 asal main kanpur main baari bheed vaali raily ke liye koi bada maidan na hone ke kaaran govind nagar main paraag deyari ke paas maujuud railway ground ke liye aavedan kiya gaya tha
 Kanpur BJP President Surendra Maithani has received a letter from the Ministry of Railways on September 26, asking that the Railway Ground not be given political support
 maithani aarope lagaate hai, railway ground lene ke liye jab maine rail mantralay ke afasaron se baat kii thi to unhone kaha tha ki nirdhaarit fees jamaa karne ke baad ground de diya jayega
 Now there is a conspiracy of the central government to not give permission suddenly
 pradesh bijepi pravaktaa vijay bahadur pathak sawaal uthaate hai ki congressi netaa railway ground main raily or sabha kar sakate hai to bijepi netaa kyon nahin? 2009 ke loksabhaa or 2012 ke vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan kai jagahon par congressi netaaon ne railway ke maidaanon par sabhaayen kii thim
 Pathak alleged, 'the SP and the SP governments of the Center and the state are looking for ways to stop Narendra Modi's rally in UP under a conspiracy
 isse yah saaf jaahir hota he ki ye sarkarein modi se kitna bhaybheet hai
 On the other hand, state spokesperson of Samajwadi Party Rajendra Chaudhary says that the state government will not take any such step which will create a situation of tension due to the rally in any area
 uttar pradesh main haal hi main sampann hue rajyasabha chunaav main ek atirikt seat par mili jeet se bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) kaa khemaa utsahit he

 Former captain Sunil Gavaskar reprimanded the Indian cricketers for the embarrassing defeat of the innings in the fourth Test at Old Trafford, saying that he did not show the courage to compete with the England team
 gavaskar ne bibisi radio ke test match special main kaha, 'bharat ne koi jajba nahin dikhaaya, khilaadiyon ne koi patibaddhta nahin dikhi
 He got out easily and did not get out on very good balls
 england ne sirf lagaataar lay main gendbaaji kii
 Gavaskar, one of the greatest openers in the history of cricket, said, "you can see that once frustrated, there is no sense of struggle in them
" ' purv bhartiya wicketiper farukh ejeeniyar ne bhi bhartiya cricketron kii aalochana karte hue kaha, 've bina kisi ‘junun’ ke khel rahe the or unhone sangharsh karne ke liye koi jajba nahin dikhaaya
 He also criticized coach Duncan Fletcher, who received 'huge salaries'
 ejeeniyar ne kaha, 'flechar ne captain mahendra singh dhoni ko tas jitkar pehle kshetrarakshan karne kii salaah nahin di
 'india are trailing 1-2 in the five-match series after losing the fourth Test innings and 54 runs
 bharat ke liye 46 test khilne vaale ejeeniyar ne bibisi radio five se kaha, 'yah sharmnaak he
 India had an ax on their foot only when they decided to bat first on the green pitch
 ' unhone kaha ki england ke purv coach flechar ko dhoni ko ballebaaji kii jagah pehle kshetrarakshan karne kii salaah deni chahie thi
 The engineer said, 'fletcher is being paid a lot of money
 beshak vah pich ko pard saktaa he or use dhoni ko usee ke mutabik salaah deni chahie thi
 ' maharashtra police ne madhya pradesh ke police ke saath milakar bid shahar me ek aise kaarkaane kaa bhandaphod kiya he jahaan 100 or 50 rupee ke note chhapane kaa avaidh dhandha chal rahaa tha
 According to the information received, the work of printing the exact notes of 100 and 50 rupees was going on in Beed city for several months
 jaali note chhapane ke liye paper aurangabad se laayaa ja rahaa tha
 The accused named Syed Shukur Shabbir has been detained
 police ke mutabik bid shahar ke peth bid thana kshetra ke gandhi nagar main ek vyakti 50 va 100 rupee mulya kii nakli note avaidh rup se chapa rahaa he, aisi jaankaree madhya pradesh police mili
 He immediately contacted the Beed Police and informed them
 is maamle ko gambhirtha se lete huepulice adheekshakaji
 On the instructions of Sridhar, police inspector Anil Jadhav of Peth Beed police station raided the house of Shaikh Shakur and seized books of printing fake currency and 50 and 100 notes worth Rs 1
5 lakh
 police ne shaikh shakur ko giraftaar kar liya he
 Are fake note gangs working? The police are involved in the investigation of who is related to Sheikh Shakur
 shaikh shakur bid tehsil ke nalvandi gaanv kaa rahenevaala he
 Two years ago, he was arrested in a case of forcibly raping a girl of his relative
 vah aurangabad ke harsul jail main sajaa kaat rahaa tha
 At the same time, Shakur met a prisoner who was serving a sentence for printing fake currency
 shakur jab jail se reeha hua to vah bhi nakli note banane kakaarobaar karnelaga
 Only the eighth pass has left the police of both states stunned by the act of Shakur
 bid main kaaphi dinon se nakli note kaa kaarkaana chal rahaa tha, par police ko isaki bhanak tak nahin lagi
 You may remember that in December last year, 14 people were killed in a fire at the One 'abab' restaurant at Kamla Mills Complex in Lower Parel area of mumbai, as there were no adequate measures to prevent the fire
 niyamon ko taak par rakhkar vah restaraan sanchalit kiya ja rahaa tha, jahaan aag kii chapet main aane se ek darjan se zyada logon ko jaan gavaani padi thi
 Similarly, many private hospitals are running in West Delhi defying the rules and regulations, where it will be difficult for people to save their lives if there is an incident like fire
 soochna ke adhikaar kanoon (artiai) sekhulasahua he ki pashchimi dilli main nijee aspataal puri tarah se surakshit nahin hai
 These hospitals are being operated bypassing the rules
 artiai se mili soochna ke mutabik pashchimi dilli ke zyaadaatar privet aspataalon ke paas dilli fire vibhaag kaa anaapatti pramaan patr (enosi) nahin he
 With most of the private hospitals in West Delhi not having the NOC of the Fire Department, the biggest question is how are they running? Except only Kalra Hospital, all the other private hospitals are unsafe
 soochna ke adhikaar kanoonke jariye mili jaankaree ke mutabik kareeb 19 privet aspataalon ke paas fire vibhaag kii enosi nahin he
 The Fire Department does not have NOC in 16 schools
 sirf aspataal hi nahin balki kai banquet haul or skool hai jinhone fire vibhaag kii enosi nahin lee he
 RTI activist Parminder Singh said, "of all the banquet halls on Rama Road, Main Road Najafgarh in West Delhi, about 30 have no NOC of the Fire Department"
 unhone bataaya ki mumbai haadase ke baad west dilli ke ilaake main sthit skool, aspataal, banquet haul ko lekar jab artiai kaa jawaab aayaa to ankhen khuli rah gayi
 The question is, if there is an accident unfortunately, how will people save their lives, who will be held accountable? What does the rule say - the reason behind the unsafe functioning of most hospitals in West Delhi is that most of the buildings are not built according to the bylots 
 masalan fire vibhaag kii enosi yani manjuuri lene ke liye aspataal kii seedhi 4 foot chaudee honi chahie
 The steps of the stairs should be 6 inches
 sabase zaruri unke paas 10,000 litre pani kaa pressure hona chahie
 Water tank, proper ventilation is most important in any hospital
 tabhi fire vibhaag enosi detaa he
 Also, the hospital must be on a 100-fit road and not in a street
 magar hakeekat yah he ki aspataal zyaadaatar puraani imaaraton main hi bane hai
 According to the rule, there may be a store in the basement of the hospital, but no activity is allowed, whereas, most of the hospitals have reception in the basement
 engiti kii pabandi kii andekhiavaidh borwell dilli ke dil se pani sokh rahe hai
 It would be surprising to know that the AGT in Delhi has completely banned the excavation of borewells
 lekin artiai se khulaasa hua he ki akele pashchimi dilli main kareeb 74 avaidh borwell paae gaye hai
 This is not only causing a loss of revenue to the Delhi government, but the ground water level of Delhi is continuously going down
 pashchimi dilli main bina parmishan kareeb 74 borwell chal rahe hai
 Illegal borewells have been found in 30 banquet halls
 zaraa sochie ek banquet haul kii saaf-safai main, samaaroh main kareeb 20 gharon kaa pani istemaal hota he
 Had these commercial borewells been valid, the government would have gained a lot of revenue
 parminder singh kehete he ki arvind kejariwal jab satta main aae to bhrastachar mukt sarkaar kii baat kahi thi, lekin aaj dilli jal board vaale paise lekar avaidh borwell chalaa rahe hai
 Pakistan Army Chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa visited the Line of Control on Sunday and said that his country would continue to support the political struggle for the right of Kashmiris to 'self-decide'

 Along with this, he was also introduced to the situation of Pakistan's preparedness to deal with any aggression
 sena pramukh ne kaha ki pakistan kashmiriyon ke sangharsh ko apana samarthan detaa rahegaa
 In a conversation with the jawans, Bajwa said, "we will always support them for their right to self-determination and the right to support basic human rights for their (kashmiris) political struggle"
 unhone bharat par kashmir main rajya pryojit aatankwaad kaa aarope lagaaya
 Bajwa alleged that India is involved in aggression not only against the people of Kashmir but also those living on the Pakistan side of the Line of Control
 bharat ne kashmir ke adhikaron ke ulanghan ke pakistan ke aaropon ko baar-baar khaarij kiya he
 Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan on Monday made a splash of announcements during the Kisan Sammelan at Jamburi Maidan in Bhopal

 Saxena said, 'my most taxing prayer is, as scientists have said that there will be a natural outbreak for the next 4-5 days, hail will also fall and rain will also occur
