 Iraq has been bled for the last two months
 in do maheenon main achaanak iesas naam kaa ek nayaa antkavaadi sanghatham naa sirf uth khadaa hua he balki puri danigha ke liye khatra ban gaya he
 But now it is not just about Iraq
 iraq kii tapish hindustan tak mahasoos kii jane lagi he
 Yes, many Indians have also reached Iraq to fight on behalf of ISIS and many are looking forward to going there
 mazahab ke naam par iraq kii hukumat par kaabiz hone kii is andhi daud ne ab tak jahaan 5 hazaar se zyaada laashen gir chuki hai vahiin usase bhi zyaada afsosna ye he ki marane waalon main begunaahon, auraton or bacchon kii ek badi taadaad shaamil he
 But now let us show you a picture of our India away from Iraq, which has a very close relationship with the current war in Iraq
 10 july ko faraashkhana ilaake main hue lo intecity blast main kisi kii jaan to nahin gai, lekin jab police or khufia agenciyon ne isaki tafteesh shuru kii to iske taar sidhe iraq or vahaan or chal rahi ladaai se jud gaye
 At first glance, it seems difficult to believe this, but what the intelligence agencies are investigating during this investigation is shocking
 sutron kii maane to hindustan ke kai noujvaan aise hai, jo iraq main maut kaa tandav machaa rahe aatankwaadi sanghathan islamic state of iraq and syria yani iesas kii madad karne iraq ja pahanche hai
 The army of the murderers led by Baghdadi continues to wreak havoc in Iraq, their Indian boys have also been involved and according to the information so far, their number is around 20
 pune blast kii tafteesh ke silsile main jo baat saamne ai, lagbhag vahi baat mumbai ke nazadik thane ke rahane vaale chaar pariwaron ne bhi der-saver saafe kar di
 In fact, every single boy of all these families mysteriously disappeared not only from their home but also from India during the battle of Iraq
 pehle to inke gharavaalon ko bhi is baat kaa ahsaas nahin tha, lekin jab unhone apane bacchon ke gaayab hone kii jagah or vaqt par gaur kiya to unka shaq pukhta ho gaya
 Then during this time one of these boys telephoned himself from Iraq and informed them about joining ISIS
 lekin sawaal ye he ki aakhir ghar valon ko bina bataae ye saare ladke iraq kaise pahunch gaye? iraq main iesas tak izhen kisne pahanchaya? or aakhir iraq se hajaaron mile dur hindustan ke in naujavaanon ko iesas se hamadardi kyon he?hindustan ke kuch naujavaanon par akhir iraq main jaakar marane-maarane kaa junun kaise savaar hua? akhir kaise kuch log iraq kii jang main shaamil hone ko jananath jane kaa rasta samaj baithe? iraq pahunche ek noujvaan ne khat ke zarie beshak apana haal e dil bayaan kar diya ho, lekin ye khat asal main uske jaise baaki naujavaanon kii jehani haalat bayaan karti he
 Letter of my family name Arif 'I am leaving home now
 mujhe allaah ke liye maidan-e-jang main shariq hona he isliye aap logon se rukhsat hone kaa yahi sabase sahi vaqt he
 My dear Validan, because if i still did not go to participate in this ongoing war in Iraq, then at the time of death the angels would ask me why i did not reach the land of Allah? Now i am not sorry for anything, inshaallah, i will meet you all in heaven

 digo maradona kii team ke sabase anbhavi khilaadi gabriyal evan hinj ke chathe minute main kiye gayi gol se argentina ne aaj yahaan nyeegeria ko 1-0 se haraakar vishwa cap footbal main apane abhiyaan kii shandaar shuruyaat kii
 In the two-time champions Argentina's team, all eyes were on star striker Lionel Messi but he failed to open his account despite many good efforts
 maradona kii team haalanki hinj ke header se nikle gol se group bi ke match main puure teen ank hasil karne main safal rahi
 Argentina adopted the attacking attitude from the beginning and adopted a strategy to pressure Nigeria, in which it was also successful
 hinj ne chathe minute main juaan sebastian verron kii carnor kik par 12 gaj kii duuri se header se gol karke apni team ko 1-0 se aage kiya
 There was no Nigerian player in front of Heinz and he took full advantage of it
 maradona to balliyon uchhalane lage or team ke prashansakon ne elice park stadium ko sir par uthaa diya
 Two minutes before this, the Argentine team had a chance to score a goal
 messi tab kai rakshakon ko chhakaate hue aage bade the
 He handed the ball to Gonzalez Hinguain but missed an easy chance to score
 higuan ko 21wein minute main bhi ek or mauka mila lekin tab unhone kalres thavej ke paas par sidhe golkeeper ke haath main shaat jamaa diya
 He who is a terrorist's terror, who is another name for terror, he who is an enemy of humanity, his flag is also black in color
 uske karname bhi kaale hai
 His mind is also black and now he has adopted black as a way to save the life of his operatives
 auraton ke kaale burkon main cheharaa chhipaakar uske aatanki iraq ke mosul main apni jaan bachaa rahe hai
 Show you the full story of Kale Burke
 usase pehle dekhie wo oparation blike kro, jo bagdadi kii kaali karatuuton par pade parde ko beparda kar degaa
 The reality Baghdadi hid from the world
 jo camere kii pakad main bhi na ai
 He who is the real face of terror
 wo kaale syah parde ke peeche chipa he
 Look at it with your eyes today
 dekhie aatank kii sultanate main kaise kahar barpata he bagdadi
 How good terrorists and their terrorists fry the entire humanity of the whole person in a moment
 uski is dehshat ke peeche koun he
 What is the reason for the cruelty
 aatank ke peeche kiskaa he shaitani dimag
 This video is the answer to all the questions
 jisamen dehshat bhi he, laachaargi bhi, bebasii he, jindagi se jang bhi he or maut bhi
 Watch this video of about two and a half minutes
 ise dekhenge to hi janenge ki jitna ham iesas ko jaanate hai, wo usase kahin zyaada khatarnaak or khoonkhaar he
 Guns in the hands of innocent children In this video, their children are separated from mothers who have guns in their hands instead of toys
 gaddhon main laashon kaa dher he or un gaddhon ko bharta bulldozer he
 Death Death is worse than animals and the whole city is like a destiny
 bagdadi kii sultanate kii ye wo hakeekat he jise darasal ek tivi siries kii shakl di gai he
 The story of this show called Black Crow, the black crow, revolves around a Yazidi woman who is forced to live in the Sultanate of Terror
 darasal ye puri kii puri kahani ek yajidi mahila kii aapbeetee ke jariye iesas kii sachai ko bayaan karti he
 But now the Kuwaiti artist playing the role of a Yazidi woman in the same film has lost her life behind the life of Mona Shaddad, a terrorist from Baghdadi
 kuwaiti artist ko mil rahi hai dhamkisubah-shaam mona shaddad ko maarane or use dhamkaane kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 Before playing the character and now while playing the character, Shaddad is receiving threatening calls daily
 kyonki jis tarah blike kro naam ke is sho ke jariebagdadi ke chehre se nakaabutarataa ja rahaa he, usase use apni pole khulne kaa dar sata rahaa he
 Not only this, this whole show shows how Baghdadi is maintaining its sultanate by deceiving Muslims in the name of Islam
 jabaki hakeekat to ye he ki wo khud islam ke naam par ek badnuma daag he, jo yuvaaon ko barglaakar apana ullu sidhaa kar rahaa he
 By releasing one-sided propaganda videos, Baghdadi has so far misled thousands of millions of young people in the world
 sho ke jariye yuvaaon ko sahi raah dikhaane kaa kammgar ab baari he unke jaise logon ko gumraahi se nikaalkar sidhi raah dikhaane kii
 The work that is being done through this show
 isliye bagdadi kii puri koshish ab is baat par he ki is sho ko jaldi se jaldi band karavaaya jaae
 And if this cannot be done then only the actors working on the show should be killed
 jin videos ko banaakar bagdadi ne apni takat badhaai, apni sultanate badhaai, apni dehshat kaayam kii, duniya bhar main naujavaanon ko gumraah kiya or senaaon ko maat di
 
 ab usee video se haar gaya he bagdadi
 He is so nervous with this TV series named Black Crow that now he wants to kill the actors working in it
 jaanate hai kyon, kyonki wo nahin chahta ki majahab ke naam par logon ko jis tarah wo bargala rahaa he, wo kaali sachai duniya ke saamne aae
 This TV series is going to open the Baghdadi poll; This TV series, which is opening the poll of Baghdadi, is being shown in all the countries of Arabia and North African countries through Black Crow Middle East Broadcasting Center (MBC)
 jiskaa makasad he majahab ke naam bagdadi ke chalaave se logon ko bachaana
 According to Ali Jaber, the director of this TV series, it is not so easy to remove ISIS from people's minds
 kyonki ab sirf ek sanghathan nahin he balki ab ye ek vichaardhaara he
 And now we cannot kill anyone's thoughts with a bomb
 aapako aatanki vichaaron se ladane ke liye usase bhi damdaar vichaaron kii jarurat padati he
 
 iesas hamaare samaaj main bahut lambey samay se chal rahi vichaar shoonyata or galat dharmik shikshaaon kii vajah se baahar aayaa he
 These series became a headache for the director, these thoughts of director Ali Jaber and his TV series are a headache for him and his unit
 khaskar iesas ke changul main fansi mahila kaa kirdaar nibhaane vaali kuwaiti artist mona shaddad ke liye, jinhen is kirdaar ko nibhaane ke liye subah-shaam dhamkee bhare phone aa rahe hai
 Mona says, 'yes it is true that i am getting threats but i am not scared at all
 agar aap ye sawaal kuch saal pehle poochhate to main kahati ki haa main dari hui hai
 But now i am not afraid of anyone
 kyonki meraa khuda meri hifaazat kar rahaa he
 The role that i am playing is very important
 kyonki is kirdaar se main duniya ko ye bataa sakuungin ki kitni aasaani se aatanki logon kaa brinwash kar dete hai
 And how they feel that they are joining the terrorists for a good cause, which is just a sham
 'har ore is tivi siries kii charchaais par bani is tivi siries kii charchaa aaj puri duniya main he
 But during the shoot of this TV series, the entire crew members were in awe due to the possibility of constant attack
 haalanki 10 million dollar kii laagat se bani is film ko lebanon main shoot karne dauraan baari suraksha mili hui thi
 Seeing their defeat close, IS terrorists are now not only saving their lives by wearing burqas, but also making the common people their shield
 iraqi sena ke mukaable wo in aam logon ko aage karke unke peeche se bhaagane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 But few terrorists have succeeded in this
 zyaadaatar ko yaa to sena ne maar giraaya yaa giraftaar kar liya gaya
 His defeat in Mosul is crucial to the end of ISIS
 june 2014 main mosul par kiya tha kabjaaies ke khatme ke liye mosul shahar kii aazaadee behad jaruri he
 In fact, after occupying Mosul in June 2014, Baghdadi not only made it the capital of his kingdom of terror, but it also proclaimed his own caliphate from here
 isliye agar mosul main bagdadi kii shikast hoti he to jaahir taur par iskaa matlab he iraq se islamic state kaa khaatmaa
 Not only this, Mosul has a huge stock of oil
 agar ye shahar haath se jaataa he to aies kii kamai kaa ek bada jariya band ho jayega
 After this, only 10 percent of Iraq will be affected by IS
 pentagon ke mutabik, iraqi sena apane tay lakshya se aage chal rahi he
 However, it is also being feared that this war to evacuate Mosul from terrorists can be prolonged
 kisi bhi had tak ja sakate hai aatankiiske sanket bhi mil rahe hai
 The militants are going to any extent in retaliation to prevent the Iraqi army from entering Mosul
 sena ke tinkon ko nishaanaa banane ke alaava aatanki shahar ke andar tel failaakar usamen aag laga rahe hai, jisase puure shahar main dhuen kaa jabardast gubaar uth rahaa he or isi gubaar kii aad main wo khud ke liye bhaagane kaa rasta taiyaar kar rahe hai
 On the one hand, while this great war of Mosul has become a question of prestige, on the other hand, the security of 1
5 million people living in the city has also started growing concerned
 andeshaa he ki aatanki apni jaan bachaane ke liye aam logon kaa dhaal kii tarah istemaal kar sakate hai
 Therefore, to deal with such a situation, the Iraqi army has dropped a large number of leaflets on the city of Mosul
 jisamen aam logon ko naseehat di ja rahi he ki ladaai ke dauraan apni suraksha ke liye unhen kya karnaa he
 Three lakh people have left home
 The UN suspects that due to the fighting in Mosul, about one lakh Iraqis may have to flee Syria or Turkey to save their lives
 iraq main aatankiyon ke khauf se kareeb teen lakh se zyaada log pehle se hi apane-apane gharon ko chhodkar ja chuke hai
 Therefore, arrangements have already been started to help the refugees in the event of such a situation again
 mosul ko aatankiyon ke changul se reeha karaane ke liye shuru hue is oparation kii taiyaari kareeb ek maheene se chal rahi thi
 The Iraqi army has not even reached Mosul, but the terrorists are already seen to be furious
 jaankaar maan rahe hai ki iraq main islamic state ke puri tarah khatme kii ulti ginati shuru ho chuki he
 Because this city of Iraq is still a stronghold of IS
 baaki ilaakon se to uske pair kab ke ukhd chuke hai
 Even in Syria, only the city of Raqqa remains in possession of the Islamic State
 aise main mosul kii haar bagdadi kii ab tak kii sabase bady shikast hogi

 Former Haryana Chief Minister Bhupendra Singh Hooda has been given relief by the Punjab and Haryana High Court
 guuruuvaar ko die apane faisle main hooda ke kaarykaal main bhoomi upyog license pradaan karne main kathith avaidhta kii jaanch ke liye gathit dhingra ayog kii report khaarij kar di
 The alleged beneficiaries of grant of license in Gurugram during Hooda's tenure included Robert Vadra, the brother-in-law of Congress President Rahul Gandhi
 dhingra ayog ke gathan ke khilaaf hooda kii yachika par guuruuvaar ko do sadasyeey bench ne faisla diya ki 2015 main ayog ke gathan main koi durbhaavnapurna iraadaa nahin tha, lekin hooda ko notice jari karne main prakriyaatmak aniyamitata thi
 a judge dismissed the report and ordered that no action could be taken against Hooda
 vahiin, anya jajon ne kaha ki in khaamiyon ke chalate iskaa shuruuaat se hi astitv nahin he
 Also, the court said that the report cannot be published
 haalanki, justise (sevanivrutt) esen dhingra kii aguwai vaali ek sadasyeey ayog dwaara jaanch ayog adhinium kii dhara-8 bi ke tahat hooda ko notice jari karne main prakriyaatmak aniyamitata paane ke baad aage ke kadam par jaj kii raay alag-alag thi
 According to Haryana High Court Advocate General Baldev Raj Mahajan, one judge wanted Hooda to be issued a notice only with a new head, while another judge was of the opinion that a new commission be set up
 iske baad faisle ko hai court ke mukhya nyaayadhish ko bhej diya gaya taaki matbhed dur karne ke liye teen sadasyeey bench gathit kii ja sake
 The bench found in its judgment that the commission constituted by the Haryana government is correct, but the notice issued by the commission to summon Hooda is not in accordance with the rules

 The second motive was that he would be evacuated whenever he wanted

 rajdhani ke agrasen college main padhgaye vaali anubhuti ko uttamnagar se laksminagar tak koching ke liye aana padataa he or ve bas se safar karti hai
 More than 60 rupees are spent daily
 agar metro muft ho jaaegi to paise bachenge
 More importantly: Metro is more secure
 anubhuti hi isamen jodatii hai ki unke college kii ladi guard ko isse zyada phayda hoga kyonki kiraaya zyada hone ke karaan vah metro se safar nahin karti
 He said these things to Delhi's Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia, who was traveling with the team of India Today TV in the bus to get public opinion after the announcement of freeing of metro and bus journey for women in the first week of June
 jaahir he, metro or bason main mahilaon ke liye safar agar mukrat ho jaataa he to 8 lakh se zyada mahilaon kii jeb, unki awajahi or sabase badhkar unki rosemara kii jindagi, unki jeevanstyli par sidhaa asar padegaa
 It is feared that congestion in the metro will increase due to the smooth journey
 is bare main dilli sarkaar kii raay saaf he
 It believes that the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC), while planning the Phase III of the metro, had estimated 40 lakh people to ride the metro daily, but so far the figure has reached around 25 lakh
 so apeksha se zyada bheed badaae kii philhal sambhaavna nahin he
 Now comes the safety
 dmarsi kaa survey kahata he ki metro ke musafiron main ek tihaai yatri mahilaayein hai
 Workers in a large number of women were forced to use relatively cheap but unsafe means of traffic such as speed service, tempo, sharing autos, due to the increase in Metro fares last time
 dilli kii aam aadmi party sarkaar ke think tanks dialog and deveopment kamishan (didisi) ke upaadhyaksh jasmin shah kehete hai, ''march 2017 main centre sarkaar ke kiraaya badhaane ke baad metro ke musafiron kii taadaad 28 lakh rojaanaa se ghatakar 25 lakh rah gai
 This had the most impact on women
 hamen ummid he ki is tarah kii sabsidi ke baad mahilaayein dilli ke sabase surakshit parivahan ke saadhan metro or ditisi bason kaa istemaal kar sakengi jinamein marshall bhi tainaat hai
 "the real question is when and how will it be implemented?" The government and the Aam Aadmi Party say that discussions are on with DMRC to prepare a proposal for ways to implement it
 jald hi mudda cabinet ke samaksh laayaa jayega or ummid he ki agast se ise lagu kar diya jayega
 DMRC paid Rs 1,506 crore as compensation for free travel from Delhi government
 maange hai
 According to Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, DMRC has asked for eight months' time to update the software and implement the scheme so that women can travel for free even through the card
 saath hi ek fori rasta bhi he ki 170 metro steshnon kii band ho chuki token windo ko phir shuru kar free vaale token jari kiye jaaen
 According to dmrc's proposal, the free travel scheme will have to take the approval of the fare fixation committee
 dilli ke parivahan mantri kailash gahalot india today se kehete hai, ''public transport muft karne ke faisle par vibhinn parivahan agenciyon ke saath vichaar chal rahaa he
 For this, the Aam Aadmi Party government is providing the budget
 cabinet se prastaav paarit hone kaa hamen intjaar he
 "for free travel, women will have to take pink colored tokens
 yatra puri hone ke baad ye token waapas aa jaaen or inkaa durupyog na ho, mahilaon ke token purush na istemaal karne lagen, is sabaki pukhta vyavastha ke liye dilli sarkaar metro ke kareeb ek hajaar daravaajon par civil dephence walantier metro steshnon par tainaat karne kaa vikalp bhi aajamaa sakati he
 The metro has spread all over NCR i
e
 Noida, Ghaziabad, Gurgaon, Faridabad, so the women of these cities are yet to be considered out of the scheme and the government believes that this work is difficult
 rahi baat purushon ko yojana se baahar rakhane kii to sarkaar ke bheetar yah dharna he ki aadamiyon ke paas parivahan ke duusare vikalp hai, masalan bike vagairah
 Security is not an issue for them
 rajdhani main ditisi or cluster kii 5,500 se zyada basen daudti hai
 They go in a non-metro route and reach villages
 dilli sarkaar ke liye bason ko mahilaon ke liye muft karne main koi dikkat nahin hogi
 In Delhi, the tickets of buses are cut by machine
 uske software main mahilaon kaa vikalp daalkar vyavastha kii jaaegi
 The conductor will ask the women whether to take advantage of the exemption
 lekin itnaa to tay he ki jo mahilaayein abhi zyada kharch kii vajah se metro main nahin jaati thim ve jarur iskaa rukh karengi
 Politics has also started on this plan
 bhaajapa kah rahi he ki yah jumala he
 The burden will be passed on to the taxpayers
 bhaajapa ke mutabik, log aisi muft kii yatra nahin chaahate
 On the other hand, apart from Sisodia who came to know the public opinion, Chief Minister Kejriwal is saying that he has not found any woman who has not cheered on the plan of free travel
 lekin bhaajapa ke pradesh adhyaksh manoj tiwari ne ise shigupha bataaya he, jabaki kendriya shahari vikaas mantri hardip puri ne pichley hafte press conference main dilli sarkaar ke elaan ko token windo frod qaraar dete hue kaha ki dmarsi yaa unke mantralay ko aisa koi prastaav nahin mila he
 Sisodia said in the reply press conference, "puri ji, you just bless me
" hamaare paas plan bhi he or paisa bhi
 "the Delhi government says that it does not need permission from the central government as it is not a matter of law and order or land
" thik bijli bill main raahat kii tarah, yah kaam dilli sarkaar kar sakati he
 Regarding passing the proposal from the Fair Fixation Committee, the Delhi government believes that it will be done
 iske liye kend ko sirf adhisuchana jari kerani hogi
 The experience so far says that the Central Government does not easily give any approval to the Delhi Government
 yojana ko 2020 main hone vaale vidhansabha chunaav se jodakar dekha ja rahaa he
 This announcement has become so much discussed that political parties will have to bear the loss of implementing it or putting obstacles in it
 iskaa asar vyapaar par bhi padegaa
 Rakesh Yadav, president of the Federation of Sadar Bazar Traders Association, says, "if the metro is free, the ladies will move to the wholesale market
" duusare, mahilaon ko purushon ke mukaable zyada rojgaar milegaa kyonki duuri or kharch kii vajah se ab tak ve naukari ke liye zyada lanbaa safar nahin karti thim
 For such tasks which require short travel, businessmen will also like to hire women because their travel will be free
 iske alaava mahilaon ke paas paisa bhi badhegaa
 Employment of women will increase by 30 percent
 bas sarkaar metro kii vyavasthaaon ko thik se mentin karne kaa plan kar le
 "traders predict that things will get cheaper in the wholesale market and sales will increase if women tell these things to each other
" baharhaal, duniya ke duusare deshon ke shaharon main jam or pradooshan se nibatane ke liye muft public transport kii vyavastha he
 This is the first announcement of such a large level of free transport in India, and after its implementation, the pressure on the governments of neighboring states is certain
 muft metro or bas8 lakh se zyada un mahilaon ko phayda hoga jo abhi metro se aati-jaati hai1,506 karod ru
 DMRC has asked for this year, such a scheme will be implemented, the scheme will get a colored token, women will enter the conductor in the machine in Metro Mendtc buses themselves
 Attendance will be deployed at 1,000 metro gates to keep the system in order
 Traffic will increase by double, women will get better jobs and jobs

 - input bhashaa Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has demanded the execution of the culprits of the Muzaffarpur scandal within three months and punishing the big leaders who saved them
 argedy netaa or bihar ke purv up mukhyamantri tejasvi yadav shanivaar ko mujffarpur ke balika grih yon shoshan cond ke khilaaf pradarshan karne or candal march nikaalane jantar-mantar par pahunche the
 Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal also reached out to support Tejashwi's protest
 is dauraan tejasvi ke manch se kejariwal ne jahaan ek ore nitish sarkaar or bijepi par jamkar hamalaa bolaa, to duusari ore congress ko bhi lapeta
 He said that this is jantar-mantar
 ek nirbhaya ke saath galat kaam hua tha to yahaan par pradarshan hua tha or upie kaa singhaasana hill gaya tha
 But in Muzaffarpur, 40 Nirbhayas have been raped
 bijepi or jediu ko chetate hue kejariwal ne kaha ki agar satta main baithe log hosh main nahin aae, to janata unhen 40 baar satta se ukhaad phenkegi
 However, when Kejriwal was speaking from the stage of Tejashwi Yadav at Jantar Mantar, Congress President Rahul Gandhi was not present there
 kejariwal bhaashan dene ke baad vahaan se fouran chale gaye or candal march main shaamil nahin hue
 Recently, Rahul Gandhi and Arvind Kejriwal were on the same stage at the swearing-in ceremony of JD (S) CM HD Kumaraswamy in Karnataka

 However, on Saturday he also referred to the upa's reign and its loss of power on the pretext of attacking the BJP over the Muzaffarpur scandal

 Rahul Gandhi said that if CM Nitish Kumar is ashamed of the Muzaffarpur scandal, then he should take action against the culprits of the case as soon as possible

 He said that on one side there is the thinking of the RSS and the BJP and on the other the whole of India

 On the direction of the court, a new guideline has been prepared by the Delhi Police, according to which a maximum of 2000 people can be performed on Parliament Street and 1000 people at Jantar Mantar
 saath hi, dilli ke boat club par pradarshan na karne dene kii sifarish bhi police ne kii he
 Significantly, in the month of July, the Supreme Court in one of its important decisions removed the ban on dharna at Jantar Mantar
 court ke aadesh ke baad jantar-mantar or boat club par bhi log pradarshan kar sakate hai
 The court also directed the Delhi Police Commissioner to make guidelines in this regard
 dilli ke boat club par saal 1993 main kisaanon kii ek raily ke dauraan ek durghatana ho gai thi jiske baad se vahaan pradarshan karne par roak thi
 According to the Indian Express, these things have been included in the draft guidelines prepared by the Delhi Police

 People's opposition to the dumping ground being constructed in Sector 123 by the Noida Authority has been steadily increasing
 isi kadi main ravivaar ko noida main rahane vaale 1000 se zyada logon ne sadakon par utarkar noida athurity ke khilaaf virodh pradarshan kiya
 The anger of the people was that the Noida Authority was misleading the NGT to build a dumping ground near their homes, while these people wanted the dumping ground not to be built here
 darasal logon kaa kahana he ki agar damping ground yahaan bana to noida or noida ekstansion ke saath- saath greater noida kii socity main rahane vaale lakhon logon kaa jeena dubhar ho jayega
 Also, the climate of this entire area will also become poisonous which will have a bad effect on the health of the people
 logon kaa kahana he kidamping groundbanane se naa keval yahaan rahane vaale socity ke log hi prabhavit honge balki yahaan based kai gaanv bhi isse prabhavit honge jo ki yahaan ke log nahin chaahate
 a woman living in a society in Noida Sector 123 said that if the dumping ground is built here, the air will be bad as well as the ground water will be poisonous, which will affect the health of the people living in the area
 vahiin is puure maamle ko lekar gaanvvaalon kaa maananaa he ki damping ground banane se unki fasalon par bhi asar padegaa
 If the RWA, working in these societies of Noida, has been working for years, he asked the Noida Authority through RTI recently that if there is a proposal to build a dumping ground at this place, then the authority denied this and now She is retracting from her statement
 virodh karne vaale logon kaa kahana tha ki is maamle ko lekar unhone kai baar ilaake ke saansad or mukhyamantri tak apni aawaaj pahunchaai lekin koi unki baat nahin sun rahaa
 The protesting people made it clear that their protest will continue till this decision is returned
 samay ke saath jaise-jaise technology ne kadam badhaayaa, hamaretelephone kii na sirf surat badalibalki uskaa istemaal bhi badal gaya
 There was a time when the phone bill was focused on call minutes and SMS, but now it is not so
 smartphone ne internet kii duniya ko hamaari hatheli par laakar rakh diya he, to phone ke bill kaa ek bada hissaa data chargeej par nirbhar karne laga he
 Apps like video calling and whatup to viber have increased spending on data charging more than bill calling and SMS
 yah sach he ki hamamen se bahut se log iske liye analimited data plan kaa istemaal karte hai, lekin ek sach yah bhi he ki kuch GB ke baad hamaara 3ji data plan dial-ap speed main canwart ho jaataa he
 That is, if you want to maintain speed, then saving data is also necessary here
 haalanki kharch main katautee ke liye ek or tareekanthi-fi network milte hi usase conect karnabhi he, lekin dinabhar yahaan se vahaan aane-jane ke kram main yah thodaa asambhav or asurakshit bhi ho jaataa he
 While there are some measures you can cut your data expenses by adopting
 jaahir taur aisa hote hi aapkemobilebil par iskaa sakaaratmak asar bhi dikhne lagegaa
 1) First of all uninstall all the apps in your smartphone that you do not use
 kyonki aksar App apadet hote rahete hai or yah bevajaah data kharch karte hai
 2) If you do not want to uninstall App then go to Settings and disable or disable its auto update
 iske liye aap App Manager jaise program kaa bhi istemaal kar sakate hai
 3) Learn to Ignore unnecessary update notifications
 jaruri nahin ki har apadet ko install kiya hi jaae
 Yes, you must install OS related updates
 isse phone ke parformens main ijapha hota he
 4) If you upload videos to youtube then upload from PC instead of phone
 in dinon amuman har achche smartphone main HD camera hota he
 In such a situation, a small HD video is also equal to 200MB in size
 jabaki ise turant phone se hi aplod karne kii bajaay taala bhi ja saktaa he
 5) Use apps like whatsapp and Viber, so avoid downloading every video sent by friends
 is babat thodi sartakta baraten or yah bhi jaanch len ki kahin sambandhit video kisi dost ne pehle bhi to nahin bheja he
 6) If you want to save data costs then avoid video chat
 mana ki yah nayaa shagal he or 3ji network ke saath smartphone liya he to states par banataa he, lekin aisa bhi kya ki har kisi ko video kol hi kiya jaae
 7) Test two-three App used for video calling based on data expenditure
 kai App kam data kharch karte hai
 While many provide such facility by spending data at the rate of 3MB per minute
 8)in dinon online game khilne kaa bhi trend badha he
 Avoid this game khelnaa hi he to use ofline install kar len
 Data is typically spent at the rate of 1MB per minute while playing online games
 9)in dinon tivi par aid dekhakar online mujeec strimming App ke prati bhi rujhaan badha he
 People indiscriminately Saavn, Hungama, Gaana
 com jaise App downlod kar manachaaha mujeec sunate hai
 But it would be better if you download your favorite songs into the phone
 10)ise is tarah samajhie ki agar koi gaanaa 320kbps bit rate se stream ho rahaa he to yah har minute aapkaa 2
 4MB is spending data
 yani agar aap ek ghanta online gaanaa sunate hai to yah 115MB data kharch kar daalata he
 11) Just like music streaming, avoid streaming live video on youtube etc
 website
 aam taur par ek acchhee quality kaa video strimming ke dauraan 50MB prati minute kii dar se data kharch karata he
 While one hour HD video streaming costs up to 3GB of internet data

 Knowing that Mukul Rai was to be expelled from the ruling Trinamool Congress on 26 September, his close backward class welfare minister Chudamani Mahato embroiled in support of Mukul
 is par mukhyamantri mamata banerjee ne bhi unki saarvajanik taur par jamkar khinchaai kar di
 At the party meeting held in Jhargram last October 10, Mamata silenced Chudamani by saying, "aren't you a farmer? Looks like you have stopped going to the fields
" bagaiyr kheton main gaye logon se aapkaa sampark kaise ho paaegaa?'' chudamani par barasane ke baad mamata ne unki safai ko bilkul nazarandaaj kar diya
 And on the same day he was removed from the post of District President of the party
 sandesh kathor or spasht tha—raay samarthakon par sakhti se karrwai hogi
 Aware of her penetration among the grassroots workers of the party, Mamata does not really want to give any opportunity to create any kind of rebellion in the party after the expulsion of Rai
 chudamani par karrwai ko sambhavit kadam kaa ek chota udhaaharan bataaya ja rahaa he
 a party leader from West Midnapore says, "we have been told not to have any relationship with Mukul Da, we have also been warned against talking to him over phone
" ''raay samarthak netaaon or kaaryakartaaon kii ore se vibhaajan kii ashanka ne hi mamata ko 25 aktubar ko party ke nirvaachit pratinidhiyon kii apaat baithak bulaane ke liye vivash kar diya
 According to reports with the state government, there are signs of a split in the party in North and South Dinajpur, North 24 Parganas, West Midnapore and Bankura districts
 raay ne jab se tiemasi ko chhodie kaa elaan saarvajanik kiya he, tab se hi kolkata or kancharapada sthit unke awaason or karyaalayon par unke samarthak netaaon or kaaryakartaaon kii bheed rahati he
 But tmc's prominent faces are keeping a distance from Rai
 jaisaa ki rajnatik vishleshak bishwanath chakravarti kehete hai, ''yah swabhaavik hi he ki sattarudh party dari hui he
 "rai has deep penetration in areas like West Midnapore
 unhone pashchim midanapur, bankuda or purulia daure kaa kaarykram banaaya he taaki tiemasi samarthakon se apane rishte ko taaja kar saken
 Mamta was also not losing time in visiting these districts
 kuch maamalon main mamata sambhavit vidrohi netaaon ko party main badi bhoomika dene se nahin hichkichain
 Mukul Rai is going to BJP bhaajapa main raay ko panchayat chunaav se judi mahatvapurn jimmedaari di jaaegi
 February 28, ie Wednesday, was a day of great turmoil in the politics of Bihar

 In the midst of this political upheaval in Bihar, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar turned 67 years old on March 1, because today is his birthday
 vaise to nitish kumaar har saal yah din kaaphi saadagi ke saath manaate hai jab unke party ke netaa or kaaryakarta unhen gulab kaa phool dekar unhen shubhakamanaayen dete hai
 But this year, due to the death of 9 innocent children in Muzaffarpur, the Chief Minister has decided to celebrate this day in a more ordinary way
 holi bhi nahin manaayenge nitishanithish kumaar kaa janmdin holi se thik 1 din pehle pad rahaa he or unhone pehle hi elaan kar diya he ki mujffarpur kii ghatana ke shok main vah is saal holi kaa tyohaar bhi nahin manaayenge
 However, it is believed that despite Nitish Kumar's decision to celebrate his birthday in a simple manner, his fans, party leaders and activists will arrive at his government house from Thursday morning to wish him
 gauratlab he ki pichley saalanithish kumaarake janmdin par pradhanmantri narendra modi ne phone par unase baatcheet karke unhen janmdin kii shubhakamanaayen di thi
 Nitish Kumar was in government with RJD at that time
 magar ab halaat badal chuke hai or vah bhaajapa ke saath hai
 In such a situation, it is believed that once again Prime Minister Modi will wish Nitish Kumar a happy birthday today

 He said, 'and enjoyment! It is also an attraction of our festival

 It is a big responsibility on our shoulders and we ensure that everything is done properly during the puja
 'is puja se judaa ek itihaas he
 Due to the efforts of an unknown railway employee, the first puja was held in 1909 at Roshanpura Kali temple near New Road
 uske baad 1913 se 1946 tak, fatehpuri masjid ke nikat ek dharmashala (saamudayik haul) main puja kaa aayojan kiya jaataa rahaa
 It was later transferred to the Bengali Senior Secondary School on Alipore Road near Civil Lines, but was never renamed
 bose ne kaha ki shuruaati saalon main, murti banaras se laai jaati thi, lekin 1926 se shahar main hi murti banane kii shuruyaat hui or ab yah skool ke parisar main hi banaai jaati he
 There is a small Bengal-like atmosphere inside the pandal for five days of worship
 paaramparik paridhaanon main saje logon se lekar saanskrithik kaaryakramon or bengal kaa pasandida vyanjan - biryani tak, yah sab ek khaas aakarshan kaa centre hota he
 Bose said that we organize cultural events in which only local residents participate
 ham kalakaaron ko aamantrit nahin karte (jaisaa adhikansh pandal main hota he)
 In addition, we ensure that all ceremonies are held in Bengali at least during these five days
 is durga puja ke aakarshan se us samay kii tatkaaleen pradhan mantri indira gandhi bhi achhuti nahin rah pai thim, jinhone 1969 main pandal kaa daura kiya tha
 It is believed that Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose also attended this festival in 1935
 bose ne kaha ki pujaariyon or dholakiyon ko kolkata se bulaayaa jaataa he
 With this, we ensure that there is no shortage of enjoyment

 ) notebandika asar dekhnaa he, to 6 maheene or intjaar kar len
 This is to say of Surjit Bhalla, member of the Committee on Economic Affairs
 unhone kaha ki notebandi kii vajah se kaala dhan waapas system main aayaa he
 Simultaneously, cashless transactions have increased
 unhone kaha ki notebandi se desh ko phayda hua he
 He was speaking at a special program organized by Aaj Tak about a year of demonetisation
 data ho jayega taiyarbhalla ne kaha ki agar hamanotbandi kaa asardekhnaa chaahate hai, to hamen 6 maheene or intjaar karnaa hoga
 During this time the complete data of demonetisation will be ready
 isse yah tasviir saaf ho jaaegi ki notebandi safal hui yaa nahin
 Assess on the basis of data Surjit Bhallane said that the success of demonetisation should be assessed on the basis of real data
 unhone kaha, '' data bataata he ki 16
 6 trillion are back in the closed note system
 isamen aghoshit aay bhi shaamil he
 This money has got legal status by coming into the system and demonetization has become a means of taking action against those possessing illegal money
 bharat main jaisi notebandi kahin naheembharat main jis tarah kii notebandi hui he, us tarah kii kahin nahin hui
 Demonetisation was done in other countries because there they had to control hyper-inflation
 bhalla ne kaha ki kitna paisa waapas aayaa, lambii avadhi main yah sawaal kuch myne nahin rakhega
 i think all the money including fake money has come back because of demonetisation
 jo bhi paisa system main aayaa he, uskaa record taiyaar kiya gaya he
 Black money has also come into the system
 ab iskaa data taiyaar he
 Government should tell how much black money came, economist Arun Kumar, who participated in the program, said that it is true that 99 percent of the closed notes are back in the system, but now the government should tell how much black money is in it
 unhone kaha ki cash main lenden phir badha he
 How can demonetisation be successful in such a situation? notebandi har cheez kaa samaadhaan nahinis par surajeet bhalla ne kaha ki ye kahin nahin kaha gaya tha ki notebandi blike velth (avaidh sampatti ) khatm karegaa
 He said that we cannot expect that demonetisation will solve everything
 notebandi kii safalataa dekhne ke liye hamen data dekhnaa hoga
 Cashless transactions have increased
 Between January and August last year, cash in atms was 16 percent
 is saal isi dauraan vah 8 fisadi ho gaya he
 Credit and debit card usage increased by 50 percent last year
 is saal yah 126 fisadi badha he
 He said that demonetisation was not done just to increase cashless transactions
 yah to sirf uskaa ek hissaa tha
 People were forced into cashless transactions Arun Kumar said that this year digital transactions are increasing, but this is happening because people were forced to do so
 unhone kaha ki cashles tranjaction pehle bhi bad rahaa tha, lekin notebandi kii vajah se logon ko na chaahate hue bhi yah karnaa padaa
 He said that demonetisation was not needed for increasing the number of POS machines and other activities including financial awareness
 rojgaar bhi bade hambhalla ne kaha ki rojgaar ko lekar jo data taiyaar kiya gaya he, vah sirf ek survey ke aadhaar par taiyaar kiya gaya he
 In such a situation, it cannot be said that due to demonetization, jobs are reduced
 unhone kaha ki rojgaar kii baat karte vakt hamen age group ke hisaab se data dekhnaa hoga
 Between January and August this year, job opportunities have increased

 uttar pradesh ke devaria jile main agyaat badmaashon ne ek eent-bhattha maalik kii dindahaade goli markar hatya kar di
 The cause of the murder is said to be the old rivalry
 devaria ke ek varisht police adhikari ne bataaya ki bhaluani thana kshetra ketekua gaanv ke paas jitendra yadavaka eent bhattha he
 On Tuesday, Jeetendra was at his kiln
 tabhi bike savaar do agyaat log vahaan inten kharidne ke bahaane vahaan pahunche
 The two unknown people reached there and talked about buying five trolley bricks
 jitendra ne unhen graahak samajhakar chaukeedaar ko chaay lene baahar bhej diya
 As soon as the janitor left, both the miscreants took out a pistol and shot Yadav
 goli lagane se jitendra kii maukey par hi maut ho gai
 After the incident, the crooks escaped from the scene
 soochna milte hi police maukey par pahunch gai

 input- bhashaa Nepotism has been discussed a lot in Bollywood this year
 kai cilabrities ne is par apana bayaan diya he
 Although Sonam Kapoor believes that people do not know what this means
 online chat sho main baat karte hue sonam ne kaha- puri industry is charchaa main shaamil ho gai, lekin puri charchaa ke dauraan main hans rahi thi
 It is said that less knowledge is dangerous
 is dauraan main soch rahi thi ki kya mujhe iskaa matlab twitor par samajhaana chahie
 My mother used to say stay away from all this
 meraa maananaa tha ki mummy log kaise iskaa matlab nahin samaj sakate?nepotism par boleen karina- ranbir kapur he to ranvir singh bhi haiunhone kaha ki bahut kam logon ko nepotism kaa matlab pataa hota he
 i would be happy to explain what this means
 kisi bhi rishte ke kaaran jab aapako koi kaam miltaa he to use nepotism kehete hai
 If you are sleeping with someone, or you have someone's girlfriend, or you are someone's friend, or someone's family and because of this you are getting a job, then it is nepotism
 agar aapke paas dictionari padhane kaa samay he yaa online jaakar iskaa matlab samajhane kaa samay he to aapako nepotism kaa matlab samaj aa jayega
 This applies to the film industry and all people of all industries
 kangana par laga nepotism kaa aarope, twitor par bhadakin bahan rangolisonam ne kaha ki is dibet ko bin baat kaa badhaava diya gaya he
 He said- My sister (producer-designer Riya Kapoor) has some interns in the company, who have come from France on recommendation
 sifarish se mili naukari bhi nepotism ke andar hi aati he
 i do not understand how and why this issue became so big? indian premier lig (ipel) kii team dilli dairedevills ne champiens lig twanti-20 cricket toornament ke tahat ravivaar ko new lands maidan par khele gaye group-e ke ek mukaable main australia kii perth scorchars ko teen wicket se haraa diya
 After this win, the Daredevils have gained 10 points from three matches and topped their group
 scorchars kii ore se rakhe gaye 122 ranon ke lakshya kaa peechha karte hue dairedevills ne teen gend shesh rahete saat wicket par 123 ran banaae jisamen virendra sahvaag ke sabase adhik 52 ran shaamil hai
 For the Daredevils, captain Mahela Jayawardene and Sehwag opened the innings

 But they are still talking about the cast
 bhujabal:dekhie, ye modi ji ke log hai
 Right now they will come to the elections and say that in our Gujarat cow and buffalo also give milk
 bijepi josh main he or use lagata he ki narendra modi kii lahar use dilli ke takht tak pahunchaa degi
 There are Navratnas in Modi's army, who are trying to win them from both the front and the back of the screen
 inamen se sabase ahm hai amit shah
 It is said that Amit Shah was the first person whom Modi talked about joining politics
 aaj usee amit shah ke jariye wo desh ke sabase bade soobe ko jeetna chaahate hai
 First Ratna: Amit Shahnarendra Modi is the biggest face of BJP, is the prime ministerial candidate and also the biggest hope and encouragement in this election
 lekin modi ke chehre ke peeche ek dimag kaam karata he, jiskaa naam he amit shah
 In 2001, when Narendra Modi took charge of Gujarat, Amit Shah joined his closest
 kaaphi amir or rais bijness parivaar se taalluk rakhane vaale amit shah ne modi kii raajnneeti ko bulandiyon par pahunchaaya
 When it became clear that Modi would be the new BJP warrior, then Modi gave the task of winning the biggest stronghold to Amit Shah
 kabhi apane grih mantralay main junior mantri rahe amit shah ko modi ne naa sirf bijepi kaa rashtriya mahasachiv banwaaya, balki uttar pradesh kaa prabharee bhi banavaa diya
 When Shah got the charge of UP, Amit Shah again raised the issue of Ram temple in Ayodhya
 mandir kaa masalaa uchhaala to jarur, lekin jab naa to janamanas ke bich se or naa hi sanghathan ke andar se koi josh dikhaa to amit shah ne dhire se ram ke naam ko peeche chhod diya or apane netaa modi kii line par aa gaye
 On the claim of development in Gujarat, on the promise of development in the country
 modi aakraamak hai, sidhaa waar karte hai lekin amit shah modi ke har andaaj se waakif hone ke baavjood mridubhashi hai
 His tongue does not reveal the scale of his political path
 amit ke dimag main modi kii raajnneeti he lekin dil main maa hoti he, jise wo sabase zyada pyaar karte hai
 Second Ratna: Rajnath Singh: Nath of the BJP, Rajnath Singh
 modi ke ek navratna ye bhi hai
 Despite strong opposition from one faction of the party, Rajnath not only made Modi the head of the first campaign but also later the prime ministerial candidate
 rajnath kii ahmiyat kaa andaja is baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki modi jinke saath sidhe hot line par hote hai, wo rajnath hai
 atal-advani's phase went into the background and Narendra Modi and Rajnath Singh appeared on stage
 badalte vakt ke saath bijepi kii ye nai jodi he
 The RSS wanted Nitin Gadkari to become BJP President again
 lekin ain maukey par rajtilak kii jagah vanvaas ho gaya
 Incidentally, after 2009, in 2014, the BJP also contested the Lok Sabha elections under his chairmanship
 is baar pradhanmantri pad kii ummidavaari kii daavedaari narendra modi kar rahe the
 Rajnath saw the opportunity and hit Modi's name
 modi ke naam par jahaan bhi aadchan paidaa hui, raste ke us pathar ko hataane sabase aage rajnath hi aae
 It is said that Rajnath Singh's strategy to fight Modi from Varanasi was to bring both Uttar Pradesh and Bihar together
 yahi nahin, modi ne varanasi sambhala or rajnath ne lakhanu
 In the electoral fray from Vajpayee's seat, Rajnath was indicating that he is the closest to Vajpayee's politics in today's BJP
 rajnath singh ne apni raajnneeti kii shuruyaat 1977 main vidhayak banakar kii
 He later became a minister in the Uttar Pradesh government, then chief minister and also a minister at the center
 do do baar party ke rashtriya adhyaksh bane or ab modi ke navratnon main shaamil hokar ek nai bhoomika kii aahat suna rahe hai
 Third Ratna: Arun Jaitleyarun Jaitley has been the Law Minister in the Vajpayee government
 wo kanoon acchhee tarah jaanate hai or modi ko kai pechida masalon par kanoonee salaah bhi dete rahete hai
 But the relationship between these two is very old
 jab hawa chali to bijepi ke kone-kone se aawaaj ai ki modi modi
 But those who realized Modi's strength long ago, his name is Arun Jaitley
 ye bahut kam logon ko pataa he ki keshubhai patel ko hataakar gujarat main nae mukhyamantri kii talash ho rahi thi, tab narendra modi kaa naam aage badhaane main jetali kii ahm bhoomika thi
 Not only this, even after the Gujarat riots, with Advani who put his strength in saving Modi, Jaitley was among them
 viraasat main vakaalat kaa pesha paane vaale jetali pehali baar chunaav lard rahe hai- amritsar se loksabhaa kaa chunaav
 After joining ABVP, he also became the President of Students' Union politics in Delhi University
 1991 main bijepi main shaamil hue
 Jaitley, who advocates for Modi on every front, is a very old friend of his
 vahi dosti ab kohinur kii tarah chamak rahi he
 Fourth Ratna: Ram Madhav Now a face from inside the Sangh, the name is Ram Madhav
 ram madhav ne ejineering kii lekin sangh parivaar ke andar narendra modi ke liye wo hameshaa se raajnneetik ejineering karte rahe hai
 You have rarely seen the bjp's PM Condidate and the national spokesperson of the RSS on a public platform
 lekin 49 saal ke ram madhav 64 saal ke narendra modi ke navratnon main gine jate hai
 Modi has been an old philanthropist from Ram Madhav
 sangh ke liye modi kaa samarpan bhi jagajaahir he
 The story of Modi and Madhav's ideological union begins in 2003 when Ram Madhav, an electrical engineering student, was appointed the national spokesperson of the association
 tab modi gujarat ke mukhyamantri bane the
 After the riots, there were many controversies with Modi, but Ram Madhav's faith in Modi remained unbroken
 vishwaas sirf hidutv kii kasuti par nahin, balki vivaad kii tamaam aandhiyon ke saamne adig khadaa rahane kii kshamta par bhi
 Today the Sangh is with Modi, so Ram Madhav is believed to have a big role behind it
 ram madhav 20 saal se bataur patrkaar sangh se jude hai
 Has written 10 books, been the editor of many magazine magazines of the Sangh
 aise main modi ke paksh main madhav kii baaten to jamani hi thi
 Fifth Ratna: Nitin Gadkari, who is at risk, is an example of how he can be even closer
 aisa mana jaataa he ki maharashtra main mantri rahete gadakari kaa shandaar kaam or modi ke paksh main banaaya gaya unka maahaul unhen badi bhoomika de saktaa he
 When Nagpur got a hint in 2009, Nitin Gadkari made an entry into Delhi politics directly from Maharashtra, erasing the hopes of all the elders in the dust
 dusron ke ulat nitin gadakari ke liye modi ke navratnon main shaamil hona bahut aasaan nahin tha
 There were many cases of his confrontation with Modi as Gadkari's party president
 kaha to yahaan tak jaataa he ki gadakari ko dobaaraa adhyaksh banavaane ke paksh main modi nahin the kyonki unhen lagata tha ki gadakari unki pradhanmantri pad kii ummidavaari ke raste main pathar ban sakate hai
 When Modi was made the Prime Ministerial candidate by BJP, the news spread very fast that Gadkari had gifted Modi a necklace
 ab ye mana jaataa he ki agar kahin modi ke gale main jeet kaa maala padaa to gadakari ek badi bhoomika main dikhaai denge
 Sixth Ratna: Modi's court is decorated with Sushil Kumar Modijin Navratnas, one of the jewels is also former Deputy Chief Minister of Bihar Sushil Kumar Modi
 ve pehle nitish kumaar ke kareebi maane jate the
 But when the alliance was broken, Sushil Kumar Modi became the best in favor of Narendra Modi
 ek kushal prashaasak kii chhavi he or narendra modi aise logon ko bahut pasand karte hai
 Wherever Modi goes, Sushil Modi is seen on his platform in every rally in Bihar
 bihar kii raajnneeti main susheel kaa jabardast dabadabaa rahaa he
 When the JP movement brought him into politics, he became a social worker in association with the Sangh
 bihar main bijepi ke liye maahaul banaaya or jediu se gathbandhan main bhi inaki badi bhoomika rahi
 Finance and Deputy Chief Minister of Bihar for 8 years
 july 2011 main susheel modi rajya vitt mantri cameti ke adhyaksh bane, jiskaa kaam guds and cells tex par kaam karnaa he
 Seventh Ratna: For the bjp's victory led by Smriti Iranirendra Modi, all the big leaders of the party are engaged with life
 lekin chote parade kii chamak damak se nikalakar raajnneeti ke khurdure maidan main utrin smriti irani hi wo netaa hai, jinhone 'namo tii' kaa idia diya
 She is very busy in making Modi's image shine
 chote parade kii bahu smriti irani raajnneeti main bada kirdaar nibhaane ke liye ain
 Ten years later, that opportunity has come, when he got a chance to contest against Rahul Gandhi, the second largest leader of Congress
 lekin is maukey se bhi badi baat ye he ki smriti aaj ke din bijepi ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar narendra modi ke sabase kareeb logon main se ek hai
 Indiy Iranian memory with feel good to visit Shining came ten years ago politics
 tab bijepi ne inhen chandani chowk main congress ke kapil sibbal ke khilaaf chunaav ladaaya tha lekin camere kii chamak-damak votaron kaa dil nahin jeet pai
 Even bigger than that defeat was that Smriti had opposed Modi
 gujarat ke dangon ko lekar irani ne modi kaa istipha tak maanga tha
 Now seeking votes in his name
 khaane pine kii ek company main kaam kar chuki smriti irani ne miss india pratiyogita main bhi hissaa liya tha
 Luck struck the small screen and political acumen made it to Parliament
 jis modi se istipha tak maanga tha, usee modi ne gujarat se rajyasabha main pahunchaa diya
 Eighth Ratna: Piyush Goyal is a Navratna of Piyush Goyal
 bijepi ke khajaanji hai
 His father was also a treasurer of the BJP
 smriti irani ne idia diya to goyal ne namo tii kaa aayojan safaltaapurvak anjaam tak pahunchaaya
 Goyal also sees the work of social media
 desh main modi kii hawa chali, chunavi kad badha, modi naam party kaa polytical brands bana
 Money management is clearly visible behind this
 hawaii yatra se lekar bhavy reliyon or puure prachaar abhiyaan tak modi ke peeche is mani game main mind he piyush goyal kaa
 Piyush Goyal, 49, is a Rajya Sabha MP
 lekin bijepi main sakriy bhoomika tragerar yani khajanchi kii he
 Piyush Goyal has also been a well-known and rank holder chartered accountant of the country
 bijepi main khajanchi kii bhoomika unhen siyaasi viraasat ke rup main mili he
 Ninth Ratna: If Saurav Patel wins BJP and Narendra Modi comes to Delhi then who can become the Chief Minister of Gujarat
 ek naam saurav patel kaa bhi ho saktaa he, jo modi ke navratnon main se ek hai
 Saurav Patel, who is a very well-educated and doing politics of development, also knows the nuances of business very well and that is why he is a favorite of Modi
 ye vahi saurav patel hai, jinhen modi mantrimandal ke sabase taqatvar mantriyon main gina jaataa he or haa, ye vahi saurav patel hai, jinka naam lekar arvind kejariwal ne baar-baar modi par nishaanaa saadhaa
 Patel, who reached the assembly for the fourth consecutive time, is the most educated minister in the Modi government
 america se emb karne vaale patel ke paas urja, petrochemical, khanan, kutir udyog, namak udyog, yojana, paryaton, naagarik uddyan, shram or rojgaar jaise ahm mantralay hai
 Patel also has the credit for building Asia's largest solar energy power plant on Narmada Canal
 patel surkhiyon main nahin rahete
 He works behind the scenes in his limited world of Gujarat
 lekin unki vikasshil niti ke kaaran ye mana jaataa he ki agar modi ko dilli kaa taj mila to wo gandhinagar patel ke hawaale kar sakate hai
 Bihar State Building Construction Corporation Limited (BSBCCL) has 40 vacancies
 icchhuk ummidavaar 5 november tak aavedan kar sakate hai

 In the third session of the GST Conclave, India Trist with Tax, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said that GST is a huge improvement in the nation's interest, so those who are not joining it are left behind because this caravan will only move forward
 is satr kaa sanchaalan india today tivi ke managing editor rahul kanwal ne kiya
 Arun Jaitley said that everything has not been decided by the Center, it has been decided by the 31 state governments and the central government together
 sabhi council baithkon kii recording hamaare paas he
 We decided unanimously on every subject
 isliye maine sabhi vipakshi partiyon se kaha he ki aapane har jagah par isapar saath diya he, jashn main shaamil hona chahie tha
 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has appealed to the Congress and the Left parties to reconsider the decision to boycott the inaugural program of the Goods and Services Tax GST system
 jetali ne kaha he kijiasti vyavasthasbhi ke sanyukt prayaas kaa parinaam he or vah ab isse alag nahin ho sakate hai
 However, if any party is against it, they should understand that this caravan will not stop now and the central government will successfully implement the new structure of the country
 rahul kanwal ne vitt mantri se jiesti kii taiyaari par sawaal karte hue poocha ki aakhir kyon yah baat uth rahi he ki kendra sarkaar aadhi-adhuri taiyaari ke saath jiesti lagu karne ja rahi he
 The Finance Minister said that the general perception is that the private sector is always ahead in economic changes or reforms in a country
 lekin aisa pehali baar ho rahaa he ki nijee kshetra kii taiyaari se kahin zyada kendra sarkaar or rajya sarkarein taiyaari kar chuki he
 Therefore, Jaitley asked the opposition parties to come forward adopting a responsible attitude in this matter
 vah aise faisle se apane ko alag nahin kar sakate hai jisamen vah bhagidaar rahe hai
 Jaitley said that GST is the biggest tax reform after the independence of the country
 GST taiyaari main sarkaar awwalrahul kanwal ne jetali se poocha ki kya sarkaar duniya ke un deshon se sabak lene kii taiyaari kar chuki he jisane bharat se pehle jiesti lagu kiya
 Answering the question, Jaitley said that there is a big fundamental difference between the introduction of GST in the rest of the world and India
 jin deshon ne bharat se pehle jiesti lagu kiya un sabhi deshon main aam naagarik or kaarobaari apana tex adaa karte hai
 In India, the attitude towards tax is poor and tax evasion is a big issue
 tex adaa karne kii aadat jarurijetali ne kaha ki jiesti main ek darjan se adhik kendriya or rajya stareey kar samahit honge
 With its implementation, the entire country will become a common market
 jetali ne bataaya ki desh main mahaj 80 lakh log indiarect tex adaa karte hai
 At the same time, the number of tax payers in Canada and Australia is very good
 lihaaja,jiesti kaa sabase bada phaaydayah hoga ki information technology ke sahare desh main tex chori par puri tarah se lagaam lagane main madad milegi or tex base main acha ijapha dekhne ko milegaa
 The consumer will be the biggest loser in Kashmir, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said that Jammu and Kashmir is the only state which has not yet formulated its law
 haalanki vah kanoon paarit karne kii disha main aage bad rahe hai
 According to Jaitley, the government as well as the opposition and the common man in Kashmir should understand that leaving behind GST will pose a serious challenge for them
 kashmir main kisi product ko le jane main do baar tex adaa karnaa hoga
 First, there will be GST and second will be the state's own tax
 iske chalate upabhokta ke liye keemat kaa andaja aap laga sakate hai
 At the same time, to make products made in Jammu and Kashmir to the rest of the country, tax will also have to be paid twice
 lihaaja, jammu-kashmir ko bhi chahie ki vah jald se jald jiesti ko lagu karne kii taiyaari puri kar len
 During this session, Aaj Tak reporter Ashok Singhal sought to know from the Finance Minister, who is going to be the biggest beneficiary of this tax reform and whether the Central Government has failed to take the opposition along at the launch? In response to the question, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley believes that GST will benefit everyone, be it businessman, common man
 isliye isko lekar logon ke man main jo bhrantiyaan he vah dur honi chahie
 According to Jaitley, the government is trying its best to remove all the apprehensions of the businessman
 jetali ne daleel di ki kendra sarkaar ke saath desh main sabhi rajya sarkarein kai dinon se jiesti ko lagu karne kii taiyaari main juty hai
 On the issue of opposition by the opposition, the Finance Minister once again appealed that all political parties should be present in a special session on this occasion

 Let me tell you that on Tuesday, Rahul Gandhi alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has violated the 'sedition' and government secrecy law by becoming Anil Ambani's 'middleman' in the Rafale deal
