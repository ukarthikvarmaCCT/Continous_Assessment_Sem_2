 The health facility in Bihar itself is 'sick'
 das karod kii aabaadi vaale bade rajya bihar main mahaj 6,830 doctor hai
 According to this ratio, a doctor comes to every 17,685 people in Bihar
 agar raashtra ke str par dekha jaae to ye anupaat 11,097 logon par ek doctor kaa he
 In such a situation, in 2015, when the Narendra Modi government announced the establishment of the second All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in Bihar, the health services sector in Bihar was expected to improve
 lekin teen saal biit jane ke baad bihar main duusare AIIMS kaa project adhar main lataka hua he
 India Today collected information about the correspondence between the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India and the Government of Bihar, regarding the establishment of another AIIMS in Bihar under the Right to Information (RTI)

 Nadda also indicated in the letter that the land concerned should be close to 200 acres
 saath hi vahaan sadak se sampark kii suvidha or pani kii uplabdhta honi chahie
 The letter was accompanied by an attachment that clarified what standards needed to be met while choosing the land

 The first on 10 December 2015 and the second on 6 May 2016
 bihar sarkaar kii ore se aakhirkaar 3 agast 2016 ko jawaab bheja gaya
 Instead of identifying the appropriate place in it, the Bihar government asked the Union Health Ministry to decide on AIIMS instead
 bihar sarkaar kii ore se jawaab main kaha gaya ki wo centre kii ore se upyukt jagah chun liye jane ke baad hi apni ore se is disha main kadam badhayegi
 The Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare again sent a letter on 8 December 2016, responding to the Bihar government's reply
 is chitthee main saaf taur par likhaa gaya ki 'nae AIIMS kii sthapana ke liye jameen kii pahchaan karnaa rajya sarkaar kii praathmik jimmedaari he
 It is also necessary to suggest 3-4 options for suitable land from the state government
 '29 march 2017 ko bihar sarkaar ne phir chitthee bhej kar apane rukh ko doharaaya or centre se hi jagah kii pahchaan karne ke liye kaha
 On 12 April 2017 and 2 February 2018, the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare reiterated the need to identify the place on behalf of the state government by sending a letter to the Government of Bihar
 abhi haal main hi 1 july 2018 ko bhi kendriya swasthya mantri je pi nadda ne bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ko ek or chitthee likhakar kaha ki mul chitthee ke follow-ap main unka mantralay paanch reminder bhej chukaa he
 Interestingly, only after a week of this latest letter, on 9 July 2018, Nadda praised the Bihar government for its achievements in the health sector in the last decade in Bihar
 nadda ne kaha, 'bihar ne beete 10 saal main swasthya ke morche par prashansaneey pragati kii he
 Secondly, Nadda forgot to mention that the Bihar government failed to make possible the establishment of another AIIMS in the state
 dabl ingine sarkaar yani agar rajya or centre main sahyogi dalon kii hi sarkaar ho to tej gati se vikaas ke liye wo adarsh sthiti hoti he
 This idea was given before the 2015 Bihar assembly elections

 'lekin bihar main swasthya suvidhaon kii jahaan tak baat he to ye dabl ingine vipareet dishaao main jor laga rahe prathit hote hai
 With the derailment of health facilities, the dream of other AIIMS in Bihar is also not going ahead of the paper

 Sri Lanka declared their first innings ended by scoring 520 runs for eight wickets and still need 63 runs to avoid an innings defeat to India
 maalinga ne 33 ran dekar teen wicket liye hai jisamen tendulkar or dravid kaa wicket bhi shaamil hai jabaki muralidharan ne din kaa khel samaapt hone se thik pehle yuvaraj singh ko out kiya jisase vah 800 wicket kii jaadui sankhya ke kareeb pahunch gayi hai

 He could not take advantage of this and in the second consecutive innings, Chanaka Welegedara returned to the pavilion in the greed to send the ball out of the boundary

 sabase mahatvapurn baat, niveshkon tak yah baat saaf taur par pahunchni chahie ki yahaan kaam teji se sampann hota he
 The Prime Minister markets India all over the world, but do you think that investment has reached more in some areas? i do not know whether the Prime Minister does marketing himself or the country

 chini sainik bhutan ke doklam par jabaran kabja karne utre, to unke saamne hamaare jawan chattan kii tarah dat gaye, bas tabhi se china baukhalaayaa hua he
 Aaj Tak's team has reached the most fragile border of india-china amid his anger
 chini sena kii chalbaaji se 1959 main tibet par jabaran kabja kar liya tha
 So, what is the purpose of China to make Bhutan a new Tibet? In Sikkim, on the indo-china-bhutan border, what is happening today is also the Tibetans living on the border who are victims of Chinese oppression and Hindustan
 Had come seemaa par based tibetiyon kaa kahana he, 'ham logon ne kabhi tibet nahin dekha, ham india main paidaa hua, lekin desh to apana apana he, 4-5 hajaar ke kareeb tibeti hai
 There will never be familiarity with China
 hamen vishwaas he ki bharat hamaare saath he or iske baad ki china badal jayega, ham bharat ko apana guruji maanate hai jo apni jagah main hamako rahane ke liye diya
 'in the conversation with Aaj Tak, Tibetans said that if China took over, we had to come here and wander here, do jobs here
 1959 main china ne tibet ke saath jo kuch kiya, aaj vaisaa hi bartaav wo bhutan ke saath karnaa chahta he
 Bhutan is a witness to what China does in the midst of peace, China is telling inversely the grandeur of India, we take you to 1959 when Tibetans came here in large numbers
 31 march 1959 ko tibet ke sabase bade dharmaguru dalai lamas bhagkar hindustan pahunche
 Actually, Tibet was forcibly annexed by China
 bharat ne china kii is kyrana or dhokheybaaj harakat kii kadi aalochana kii thi
 But the imperialism of China was so much increased that it attacked India itself, which India had given the slogan of Hindi Bhai Bhai as the brother of China, but today India is cautious
 lekin bharat ke is safagoi bhare jawaab se china tilamila uthaa, wo bharat ko khuli dhamkee dene laga ki doklam main bharat khud peeche hat jaae yaa doklam par kabja kar le, varanaa china ne hamalaa kiya to bharat maaraa jayega
 a lot has changed in the last 55 years
 nahin badla to sirf china kii niti or niyat, isliye doklam main vah bharat se bhid gaya
 But the people of Tibet living in Sikkim believe that India is doing a great job by protecting Bhutan
 sikkim ke paas doklam main china ne chori chupe sadaken banaakar naa sirf seemaa kii maryaada todi he balki apni chalbaaji bhi saamne laa di
 China's move is clearly stating that in 1962 it had betrayed India for Tibet, now it wants to target Bhutan
 jis doklam kshetra par sara vivaad khadha he, wo bhutan kaa ilaaka he lekin china ne us par hamalaa bol diya to bharat bhutan se apni dosti kaa nirvaah karte hue uske saath khadaa he
 China wants to develop this Doklam region as its military cantonment, as well as China wants to separate Sikkim and North East India from India on the pretext of Doklam
 lekin bhartiya jawan doklam main bhi or doklam se neeche sikkim main bhi sarhad par ji jaan se date hai
 The Chinese government claims that Doklam is its territory under an agreement reached with the British in 1890
 isi bahaane uski najar sikkim par bhi he
 According to the Chinese claim, India's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru also recognized this agreement
 lekin nehru ke ek khat se khulaasa hua he ki china kaa daawa puri tarah jhootha he
 While objecting to the large part of Bhutan being shown as part of China in the Chinese map, he wrote in a letter to Chinese Prime Minister Chou En Lai that in the 1890 agreement between China and the British, clearly the sovereignty of India over Sikkim
 Was recognized
 nehru ne saaf likhaa tha ki sikkim kii seemaa ko lekar koi vivaad nahin he
 This had to be said to the Nehru who trusted China completely, but today the truth of China is clear like a mirror

 ’ The Haryana government is trying to release water into the Saraswati river and revive the form of the Saraswati river
 sarkaar apane is prayaas ko final daur main hone kii baat kah rahi he to vahiin haryana sarkaar ke in daavon par sawaal bhi uth rahe hai
 The government is also facing political attacks on this issue
 in sab baton kaa jawaab dene ke liye khud mukhyamantri manohar laal khatter maidan main utren
 Manmohan Lal Khattar said that Saraswati river project is connected with the faith of the people of Haryana and the country
 hamanen kabhi ye daawa nahin kiya ki ham saraswati nadi ko phir se vahi rup de sakate hai
 As stated in mythological beliefs, no one can give it
 saraswati nadi to pahaado se nikalati thi or hamanen nasa ke jariye mili tasveeron or haryana sarkaar ke puranic mughal kaal ke revenue record ke aadhaar par is manyata ko ek rup dene kii koshish kii he
 Water has to be released from some feeder canals and drains in Saraswati
 chaahe hamen yamuna nadi se pani lekar chhodana pade
 a budget of 5 crores for this project, CM Khattar said- Our effort is to reopen the route on which the river Saraswati used to flow in the mythological times
 is pani kaa phayda vahaan aas-paas rah rahe logon ko mili
 We cannot revive Saraswati at all
 kyonki haryana ke aage saraswati kaa root rajasthan kii or jaataa he
 It is not possible to excavate in the sandy area there
 is project ke bajet ko lekar jo sawaal uth rahe hai wo bhi gaiyr-vaazib hai
 There is a budget of only 5 crore or so
 usamen kya koi bhrashtachar karegaa or kya hamaari sarkaar ne paisa vyarth kar diya
 The job of the opposition is to keep raising questions
 lekin hamen aasthaa kaa bhi dhyaan rakhana chahie
 Legendary beliefs are associated with Saraswati river: Fire brand cabinet ministers of Haryana government also come to the ground to defend the government on Saraswati river
 cabinet mantri anil vij ne kaha ki ye saraswati nadi hamaari aasthaa kii pratik he
 Scientific things are not done where there is talk of faith
 saraswati nadi hamaari puranic manyataon se judi he
 We are trying to revive his form
 ab hamen chahen usamen kisi or nadi, dren se pani lekar chhodana pade yaa phir pump lagane pade
 We will resume this form of Saraswati river and our faith
 haryana ke paryaton mantri ne bhi in baton ko darkinar kar diya kisaraswati nadike project ko shuru karne se pehle sarkaar ne kisi tarah kii research nahin kii thi yaa phir scientific fact ko samajha nahin tha
 He said that the route has been excavated
 ab pani chhodane kii taiyaari kii ja rahi he vahaan par nasa ne bhi saraswati nadi hone kii pushti kii thi
 In such a situation, it is not right to question the nature of the river Saraswati
 khudaai kiye gaye root par jo rigervyr banaae ja rahe hai wo saraswati nadi puure saal isi rup main rahe uske liye banaae ja rahe hai
 The Opposition also clearly said that the former Haryana Chief Minister Bhupendra Singh Hooda also pumped water on the Saraswati river and said that no river can be started by installing tubewells in this way
 haryana vidhansabha main vipaksh ke netaa or indian neshnal lokdal ke varisht netaa abhaya chautaala ne bhi saraswati nadi ke project par sawaal khadey karte hue kaha ki sarkaar jabardastee us root par khudaai karke nadi banane par tuli he
 When even a square of water came out in a little digging, the minister and the Chief Minister of the government reached there to worship themselves and send water to Saraswati, whereas the level of ground water was very high there, due to the high water level in the excavation anyway Comes out boring ab jab puure root par khudaai ho gai or vahaan se pani nahin niklaa to apni naakani chhipaane ke liye vahaan sarkaar pump lagavakar or pani chhodkar apni vifaltaa par pardaa daalane kii koshish kar rahi he
 The Saraswati river will develop at the international level, while the Haryana Saraswati Heritage Development Board also defended the existence of the Saraswati river by keeping many facts to defend the questions arising on its project and government
 board ke upaadhyaksh prashanth bharadwaj ne saraswati nadi kii khudaai ke dauraan mili kai puranic avshesh bhi dikhaae
 He said that in the first phase we are working on the aspects of interlinking and intra-linking of rivers
 isamen ham nadiyon ko jodne kii koshish kar rahe hai
 Because any river is formed, it is formed by connecting many streams
 usee ke tahat ham jo saraswati nadi kaa rivival kar rahe hai
 In the second phase, we are constructing a huge dam on Adibadri
 iske alaava webacos ko bhi hamane kaam diya he
 webcos is exploring more possibilities there
 vahaan kii study or adhyan kaa kaary bhi jari he
 Prashant Bhardwaj said that right now we cannot say what we have reached
 lekin agle teen-chaar maheenon main hamaari sthiti spasht ho jaaegi
 Apart from this, we are also constructing large reservoirs in three places
 saraswati sarovar naam se, yamunanagar, pehwa or uske aage shivasar kaa jangle he 11 hajaar acre kaa, vahaan ham ye teen jalashay ham bana rahe hai
 There we are trying to promote dimensions like eco-terrorism, Divine Tourism and Orchological Tourism
 vahaan herbal park or museum banane kii bhi taiyaari he
 The central government has also hired an international level tourism consultancy company to link this entire project to 7 states which will develop this Saraswati project at international level
 saraswati nadi ke rivival par haryana main pichley 30 saalon se adhyan chal rahaa he
 Based on these studies, we are digging there
 haryana sarkaar kii manshaa har haal main apane is project ko puraa karne or kritrim tareekon se hi sahi, saraswati nadi ko bahaane kii he

 unhone ravivaar ko rahul par kataaksh karte hue kaha, 'haare or thake hue log pradhanmantri narendra modi ke kaaravaan (2019 ke aam chunaavon main modi kii jeet) ko nahin roak sakate
 Ravi Shankar Prasad said this while addressing an event organized to mark the completion of four years of NDA

 He said, 'the Congress president discusses the judges of the Supreme Court in his public meetings and the matter which has been decided by the court
 ' kendriya kanoon mantri ne kaha, haare hue log court main pryojit yachika daayar karke desh nahin chalaayenge
 Ravi Shankar said that Kapil Sibal and Congress are also doing politics on Ramjanmabhoomi
 unhone kaha ki vipaksh din main sapane dekh rahaa he or ham jameen par kaam kar rahe hai
 Now the entry of brokers in the court of Delhi is closed
 kanoon mantri ne kaha ki teen talaak ke mudde par sarkaar bilkul spasht he
 The minority society should understand that the provision of immediate triple talaq has been abolished in 22 Islamic countries of the world

 Why should such a law remain here? yahaan bhi mahilaon ko aazaadee milani chahie

 pakistan kii inter services intelligence (iesai) duniya kii sabase taqatvar khufia agency he
 The website named 'best Top 10' has presented this assessment quoting American Crime News
 website par di gai jaankaree ke mutabik america khufia agency siie jahaan duusare number par he, vahiin tisare number par euke kii emai-6 he, or bhartiya khufia agency research and enelysis wing (ro) aathven paaydaan par he
 No information has been given on the website as to what is the basis of this assessment regarding intelligence agencies
 agenciyon ke aakaar, prakaar, pahunch or asar yaa nattejey kisi bhi baat kaa byoraa nahin diya gaya he, lekin, is list par bharosa karen to bharat ko apni khufia agency ko or majboot karne kii disha main kaam karnaa hoga
 Especially as the country is constantly trying to overcome terrorist threats and challenges, the role of the intelligence agency becomes very large
 har desh apni suraksha sambandhi zaruuraton ko puraa karne ke liye khufia agenciyon par nirbhar karata he
 It is the intelligence that can prevent any incident before it reaches its end
 khufia agenciyaan duusare deshon se judi khufia jaankaree main send lagane ke liye bhi jaani jaati hai, or duusare deshon kii khufia agenciyon ke asar ko kaatane ke liye apni khufia agency ko zyaada kargar bananaa zaruri hota he
 a Pakistani intelligence agency like ISI is also infamous for promoting terrorism and violence on Indian soil
 so, aise main agar iesai ko sabase taqatvar agency ke taur par shumaar kiya gaya he, to yah bharat ke liye or chintaa kii baat he
 Although a matter of relief, it is one number below Chinese intelligence agency MSS, RAW, at number nine
 hairaani kii baat he ki israel kii agency mosaad, jiske charche chaaron taraf hote hai, 10wein number par he
 RAW was founded in the year 1968, and in this regard, it is necessary to trace the conspiracy or schemes against India on foreign soil, collect information about criminals and terrorists and accordingly It is the responsibility of providing information, so that the policies related to the security of the country and its people can be effectively created and implemented
 is list main shaamil 10 sabase taqatvar khufia agenciyaan is prakaar hai

 ) In Raipur, the capital of Chhattisgarh, the police have caught a gang who used to collect millions of rupees from blackmailing minor girls
 hairaani kii baat he ki is gang ke adhiktar sadsy khud bhi chaatr hai
 When this gang laid hands on the daughter of a big businessman, then the matter reached the police
 police ne is maamle main gang ke sargana samet 4 logon ko giraftaar kar liya he
 Police arrested the gang following a complaint
 is gang ke sargana kii pahchaan adarsh agarwal ke rup main hui he
 According to police, the 15-year-old daughter of a big businessman living in Anand Nagar, Raipur is a 10th-grade student
 kareeb salbhar pehle fasebuk par uski dosti ek 17 varshiya kishor se ho gai thi
 The boy is a student of 11th grade
 pehle donon fasebuk par baaten karte rahe lekin jald hi donon ke bich mulakaaton kaa daur shuru ho gaya
 One day the student introduced the girl to her friends Adarsh agarwal and Sohrab
 is dauraan adarsh ne us ladki se dosti kar lee
 a few days later, Adarsh told the girl that his friend, who had been friends with both of them, is battling cancer
 uske ilaaj ke liye kareeb 5 lakh rupaye kii zarurat he
 But he has no money
 adarsh ne ye baat is tarah se bataai ki ladki ko uski baat par bharosa ho gaya
 She became emotional and started talking about paying for the boy's treatment
 adarsh ne fouran hami bhar di
 After this, unaware of Adarsh's conspiracy, the student took out about 4 lakh rupees from her mother's account and gave it to Adarsh and asked her friend to get treatment
 kuch maah tak to sab thik rahaa lekin achaanak ek din chaatra ke saamne sachai ujagar ho gai
 After this there was an argument between the girl and those two boys
 phir ladki ne un donon se milanaa julna band kar diya
 She did not even talk to him
 beete disambar maah ke dauraan donon ladakon ne phir se chaatra ko jhaanse main le liya
 Both of them apologized according to the plan
 ek din adarsh chaatra ko apane dost ke ghar le gaya or vahaan uski ashleel video bana lee

 RJD President Lalu Prasad Yadav has demanded the CBI to investigate the government money scam case in Bhagalpur
 unki kaha he ki bihar ke upmukhyamantri susheel kumaar modi ko barkhaast kar unhen jail bheja jaae
 He has given Nitish Kumar till Sunday for this action
 halaki unka yah bhi kahana he ki ek karod ke is ghotaale main nitish kumaar or susheel kumaar modi kii samaan sahabhaagita he kyonki isaki shuruuaat 2005 main hui thi jab inaki jodi ne bihar kii kaman sambhaal rakhi thi
 Lalu Yadav's target is currently Sushil Kumar Modi because he was the one who worked to break the alliance of JDU and RJD by disclosing benami property on Lalu family
 apane maamle main sibiai ko tota kehane vaale lalu prasad yadav ko is maamle main sibiai kii jaanch par hi bharosa he
 Lalu Prasad Yadav said that Prime Minister Modi had given the slogan of Quit India in corruption on 9 August in Parliament, in such a situation, now he should decide that Sushil Modi used to be the Finance Minister of Bhagalpur in Bihar, which is such a big scam, after that he should remain in the post What right lalu yadav ne aarope lagaaya ki check bouns hone ke baad nitish kumaar ne aanan-fanan main bhed khulne ke dar se jaanch apane chehate afasaron se karakar praarambhik report de di

 Lalu Prasad also said that according to the information received, in 2013 the Reserve Bank wrote to the government for its investigation, then why no action was taken at that time
 lalu ne uthaae yah sawaal1
 Those who are the creators of the creation scam should be investigated at which officer's level and on what conditions they are allowed to work as a bank

 According to the source, there was pressure on the district collectors to deposit the amount in the bank accounts of the creation

 Why did the investigation not take place even after the RBI order, if it is there, where are its reports

 BJP leaders have adopted a unique way of protesting against the Kejriwal government
 dilli ke conot place ke central park main photo pradarshnee lagi he
 Its name is Kejriwal's exhibition of false promises
 isamen 22 katout lagaae gaye hai
 In these, the false promises of the Kejriwal government in Delhi are shown sarcastically by comparing them with the promises made in Punjab
 nae punjab menkejariwal kaa vaadanshamukt punjab jabaki dilli main 400 se zyada sharaab ke license die gaye
 At the same time, CCTV cameras will be installed, whereas in Delhi, 150 CCTV cameras will not be installed in one and a half years

 pradhanmantri modi or america raashtrapati donald trump ke bich pehali mulaakaat is saal may tak ho sakati he
 According to some media reports, diplomats from both the countries are exploring the possibility of Modi's visit to America for this
 haalanki modi or trump july main germany ke shahar hamberg main hone vaale ji-20 deshon ke sammelan main bhi ek duusare se mukhaatib honge
 But according to the news, governments on both sides want an early bilateral dialogue between these leaders
 mulaakaat kyon jaruri?pichley kuch arase main america siyaasi partiyon main takreeban har masale par matbhedon kii khai chaudee hui he
 But the relationship with India is one of the few issues on which the Republican and Democratic parties hold an opinion
 lihaaja donon desh chahenge ki rishton ko majboot banane kii kavayad ko aage badhaayaa jaae
 The issue of H-1B visas will be of paramount importance for discussion in the meeting with Trump in front of Modi as Trump's stricter policy against expatriates could hurt India's software sector
 modi bharat jaise bazaaron main utpaadan kii khwaahish rakhane vaali america companiyon par bhi trump se safai chahenge
 Recently Lockheed Martin, a manufacturer of fighter aircraft and Apple cellphone company, has offered to build a factory in India
 lekin trump kah chuke hai ki videshon main naukariyaan le jane vaali america companiyon par tex badhaayaa jayega
 Apart from economic issues, issues of terrorism and China will be the most important in the meeting between the two leaders
 ummid kii ja rahi he ki in donon masalon par donald trump bharat kii puri himaayat karenge
 The strengthening relationship was among the leaders of the world who first congratulated Trump on the victory
 badale main trump ne bhi raashtrapati banane ke baad britain jaise kareebi doston ke pradhanmantri se pehle modi ko phone ghumaya
 It is being told that talks between the two countries have started silently on issues like visas
 trump prashasan main raksha mantri james mattis bhi apane bhartiya sahyogi manohar parrikar ke saath baatcheet kar chuke hai
 Similarly, talks have also been held between US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Indian Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj

 ek naam bharat ke sarvaadhik pratishthit bharataratna ke liye nanaaji deshmukh kaa, doosraa naam padmashri ke liye ek theth ganwai kisaan babulal dahia kaa
 i had the opportunity to see the works of both of them before, but these awards made the journey more important
 nanaaji deshmukh ne sakriy raajnneeti se avkaash lekar jo kshetra chunaa, usamen satna kaa majhagavaan ilaaka bhi he
 Here his institution established the Center for Agricultural Sciences
 yah ilaaka chitrakoot se 30 kilometre dur he
 Gramodaya University was established in Chitrakoot
 us vakt is ilaake main daakuon kaa khaasaa aatank tha
 In this area, he started the ground work of rural development
 majhagavaan se koi saat kilometre kii duuri par basii devlha panchayat or isse thik do kilometre dur patni panchayat aise do gaanv the, jin gaanvon ko nanaaji deshmukh ne god liya tha
 Their village couple lived here permanently and contributed to the development of the village
 yahaan bada kaam sookhe se nipatane ke liye pani kii sanrachanaayen viksit karnaa tha
 Hundreds of water infrastructure were constructed in these two villages to stop the water
 desh ke saikadon gaanvon main aise kaam hue hai, yah koi bahut nai baat nahin thi, lekin yah gaanv tab mahatvapurn ho gaye, jab 27 march, 2003 ko tatkaaleen pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi khud pahunche
 Vajpayee inaugurated the catchment area management project, the Prime Minister made many promises and announcements for the development and people of the area
 iske do saal baad tatkaaleen rashtrrpati dow apije abdul kalam gram patni dadin main talab kaa locarpan karne aae the
 90 percent of the population of this panchayat is tribals
 unhone protocol todakar yahaan graminon ke saath jameen par baithkar bhojan kiya
 The villagers became confused
 pehle pradhanmantri or phir swayan rashtrrpati
 It will probably be the only remote village in the country that has got the chance of hospitality of a Prime Minister and a President
 aisa hone se to in gaanvon kii surat hi badal jaani thi, surat badali bhi, lekin us vakt jab in hastiyon kaa aagaman hona tha
 Roads were built overnight in these villages
 lekin ab takreeban 14 saal guzar jane ke baad ab gaanv ko dekhakar aap kah nahin sakate ki desh ke nakshe par yah itnaa mahatvapurn hoga
 You will be able to know by looking at the inscriptions that the first people of the country had ever visited this village
 uske alaava in gaanvon kaa cheharaa ab bhi ek badahaal hindustan jaisaa hi he
 Even now local organizations are fighting on issues like malnutrition, education, health, water, employment
 patni panchayat ke dadin tole main to mini anganwari tak nahin khul pai
 The appearance of this area is still sad
 nanaaji deshmukh kii god lee panchayat devlha main us din soshal audit chal rahaa tha
 This is the provision of the National Food Security Act 2013, in which people of the village can audit schemes related to food security, such as public distribution system, mid-day meal, anganwadi etc
 is gaanv ke soshal audit se pataa chalaa ki unki rashan dukaan par teen maheene main jitna anaaj sarkaar se aayaa or jitna banta, usamen 40 quintal kaa antar he
 Four such people were found in the village, who are getting ration even after their death, and there are also people, whose names are not in the eligibility list even though they are eligible
 masalan, is panchayat ke ahiraan tolaa ke rajaraam yadav or ramadhani, godantola ke sanpat gond or umariha ke baade kol kaa nidhan ho chukaa he
 The people of the panchayat sitting on the stage were surprised how this all came to be known
 soshal audit karne waalon ne bataaya ki aajkal internet par sab aa jaataa he, vah puri taiyaari se aae hai, soshal audit ke liye kaagajon kii puri file teble par saamne rakh di gai
 Having seen this, it is also learned that the beloved Mavasi of Devalha village, Kishori Mavasi and grandfather of Rohania village Gond Bhai and Bullare Gond have gone away from the village, but their names have also been distributed ration, while he There is no village in the period
 is gaanv main 18 mahilaayein us pradhanmantri maatrutiv vandana yojana kii paatr maani gayi, jisaki ghoshnaa swayan pradhanmantri narendra modi ne 31 disambar, 2016 ko kii thi
 Only one woman has got the benefit of this scheme, she has been paid only three thousand rupees
 madhya pradesh main bacchon kaa kuposhan sabase badi chunauti he
 It was found out that only nine percent of the children have got morning breakfast and hot cooked food in Anganwadi, 91 percent of the children are deprived of this service of Anganwadi in these three months, and the third meal is not available to any child
 kamaal kii baat yah he ki anganwari main pakaa hua bhojan mil nahin rahaa, lekin jab tech home rashan, yani ghar le jane vaale packet kii baat aati he, to chah maah se teen saal tak ke bacchon ko 453 packet, garbhvatee maataaon ko 67 packet zyada baant die gaye
 Voluntary organizations have been demanding to feed eggs in Anganwadi to remove malnutrition
 is maang ko sarkaar ne kabhi nahin mana, yah alag baat he ki sarkaar apni paryaton hotalon main khuleam maansaahaar parosati he
 Shivraj Singh Chauhan made a provision of distributing milk to children here as an alternative to eggs
 pichley teen maheenon se is gaanv ke ek bhi bachche ko mid de mile or anganwari main doodh naseeb nahin hua he
 The sarpanch of the village, Inderkumar Yadav was surprised to see all this, he said that this is his meeting and he will resolve the issues arising out of it
 sachiv mahoday ne sabhi binduon ko note bhi kiya
 When we asked the villager Manik Vishwakarma who conducted this meeting on behalf of the village, what changed in the village in the last 20-30 years
 vah kehete hai, 'thodi-bahut kheti-kisaani thik hui, lekin swasthya or shiksha kaa to vahi haal he
 The children of the village are unable to go out to study further and the alcohol itself comes to the village
 
 
 'yah us adarsh gaanv kii sthiti he, jahaan ek raashtra sant apane jivan kaa ek bada hissaa lagaate hai, unako bharataratna bhi diya jaataa he, lekin us gaanv main bhrashtachar kaa daitya to ab bhi attahas karata najar aata he, sawaal yah he ki aakhir in samasyaon se ladane ke liye or kitna or kis str kaa kaam karnaa hoga, jab hindustan apane in kalankon se mukt ho paaegaa

 On a question from DMK MP Kanimozhi, 'e-currency is Ponzi scheme', Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said in Parliament that a committee has been formed to look into the matter
 unhone kaha tha ki kryptokarency se sambandhit sabhi maamalon par uchit kadam uthaane ke liye sabhi upaay apanaae ja rahe hai
 It is not clear what steps the government will take in this direction

 bharat main kai log bitaqoin main trading kar rahe hai
 The picture is not clear on what will happen to the cryptocurrency purchased by these people
 sarkaar ko kryptokarency main hone vaali trading par lagaam lagaani he to is disha main spasht kadam uthaane honge
 Other countries have also imposed it: In January this year, China also announced changes in its rules to ban trading in cryptocurrencies
 dakshin korea bhi i-karency main vyapaar par roak laga chukaa he
 Many countries and banks around the world are upset with the trade in e-currency, because this gives the banks or the government nothing on the transaction
 blikemani par ection to nahin?kai vishleshkon kaa maananaa he ki anderworld yaa blike mani holder kryptokarency kaa istemaal karke apane paise ko nivesh karne kii koshish main hai
 Therefore, a guess is also being made that the action taken by the government against it is an action taken against bringing black money into the mainstream
 iske alaava agar is tarah kii karency ko havers chura lete hai to maujuuda vyavastha main use waapas laane kaa koi praavdhaan nahin he

 jabaki kai kshetreey dal hai, jo kingmekar kii bhoomika main aa sakate hai
 In such a situation, both the BJP and Congress parties will need the support of satraps to sit on the throne of power
 bataa den ki yahsurvey97 sansadeey kshetron or 197 vidhansabha kshetron ke 12,100 logon ke bich karaayaa gaya
 The survey was conducted between 18 July 2018 and 29 July 2018
 india today-karvi ke mood of da nesanasrve ke mutabik 543loksabhasiton main se bijepi ko 245 siten milti dikh rahi hai
 Whereas in the 2014 elections, it got 282 seats

 In this way, BJP is getting 27 seats less than the majority figure of 272 seats on its own

 Whereas in the last Lok Sabha election, 44 seats were won
 is tarah se congress ko 39 siton kaa ijapha hota dikh rahaa he
 Although far from the magical figure of the majority
 haalanki, 281 siten endie gathbandhan ko mil rahi hai
 At the same time, 122 seats can go to the UPA account, while the remaining 140 seats are expected to be in the account of other allies
 lekin sapa, basapa, tiemasi, tidipi or pidipi jaise dal agar upie ke saath milakar chunaav ladate hai to aise main nattejey chaunkaane vaale ho sakate hai
 In this case, NDA can get 255 seats and UPA can get 242 seats
 jabaki anya ko 46 siten mil sakati he
 From the perspective of the survey, in such a situation, the role of regional parties, which are not part of any alliance, becomes very important
 inamen bijedy, tiares, ediemke or wiesar congress aisi partiyaan hai jinke ruukh abhi saaf nahin hai
 According to the survey, there are about 46 seats in their account
 yahi partiyaan kingmekar kii bhoomika main hongi
 These four parties will have an important role to sit on the throne of power

 He will be able to hold power
 haalanki, in kshatrapon ke pichley record ko dekhen to kai maukon paramodisarkaar ke saath khadey najar aae the
 In such a situation, when the NDA will get away from the majority figure, will these regional parties help in forming the Modi government

" jaidi ke mutabik, eiaare ke chairman yashavanth es
 Bhave clarified several points where he felt that the audit's understanding of the subject was not correct
 jaidi ne kaha ki draft report main pesh kiye gaye kuch muddon kaa hal nikaal liya gaya he, jisamen ''riyaayat kii avadhi, pehle inkaar kaa adhikaar, agrim shulk, airport athurity of india ko 190 acre atirikt jameen aavantit kiye jane ke liye 6
 19 crores Rs

 Zaidi alleges that the points discussed in this meeting were not part of the minutes
 ve kehete hai ki kai aise binduon ne minutes main apni jagah bana lee jin par na to charchaa hui he or na hi use draft report main shaamil kiya gaya he

 The CAG has also stated in its report that the government has given DIAL the benefit of levy tax exemption in development charges after the contract, with the burden of the project costing 3,415 on passengers

 6-year-old Talia Rehman of Rawalpindi, Pakistan, is enjoying her extended vacation in Poonch, Jammu and Kashmir these days
 taalia ke sabhi dost uske apane desh main skulon main laut chuke hai, lekin taalia chhuttiyaan manaa rahi hai
 However, this little girl does not even realize that her family is forced to stay in India due to the enmity between India and Pakistan
 shuukravaar ko kareeb ek dashak baad poonch main barfbaari hui he or barfbaari kaa lutf le rahi taalia ke anusaar use kitaaben padhanaa to acha lagata he lekin skool janaa boring
 Talia had come to visit her relatives along with her parents and siblings in Poonch district of Jammu and Kashmir along the Pakistan border about a month ago
 unhen 14 janvari ko chakkan da baag-rawalkot bas root se waapas pakistan janaa tha lekin border par hinsa ke baad elosi ke paas sadak ko band kar die jane ke kaaran ve yaheen funs gaye
 The recent ceasefire violations and the beheading of two Indian soldiers have increased the tension between India and Pakistan on the loc, affecting travel and trade across the Line of Control
 taalia ke pita abdul rahamaan sabar kehete hai, ‘hamaara aadha parivaar pakistan main he or ham jald se jald vahaan pahunchnaa chaahate hai, kyon ki vahaan hamaare bachein pareshaan hai
 'abdul Rahman has a travel agency in Islamabad, the capital of Pakistan
 sabar parivaar ke ek sadsy 1947 main vibhaajan ke samay pakistann chale gaye the
 Abdul has had to cancel many of his business meetings during this period
 unka kahana he ki sadak band hone ke kaaran unhen 50 lakh kaa nuksaan ho chukaa he
 Abdul himself is also interested in politics and he feels that mutual negotiation is the only way to deal with every kind of dispute
 2006 main rawalkot se poonch ke bich chali ‘shanti bas’ main safar karne vaale group main abdul apane parivaar ke 17 logon ke saath maujuud the
 Many people had come to Poonch from Pakistan before the recent dispute and they are stranded at different places after the road was closed due to the dispute
 abdul kii patni naseeb akhtar kahati hai, ‘mujhe ummeep he or main dua karti hum ki is somvaar ko sadak khul jaae
 'it is worth noting that the passenger bus runs between Chakkan da Bagh to Rawalakot every Monday
 haalanki is parivaar ke paas kashmir main uri yaa wagha border ke jariye bhi pakistan waapas jane kaa vikalp he
 But it will take them three more days to reach home
 somvaar 21 janvari ko unhen pataa chalegaa ki ve chakkan da baag-rawalkot road se ghar ja paaenge yaa nahin
 Till then Talia is enjoying holidays with her siblings
 or wo nahin rahi
 
 
 When everyone was busy in saving themselves, she could not save her remaining breath in her country
 17 disambar kii subah kii shuruyaat ek phone se hui thi
 Gang rape in a moving bus
 
 
 ladki kii haalat najuk, bachanaa mushkil he
 
 
 Keeping the phone, immediately informed the office, but in this quick moment one thing got stuck in the mind
 ladki kaa bachanaa naammumkin? kaise?mujhe bataaya gaya ki ladki ko buree tarah maaraa-peeta gaya he
 Day climbed when it was discovered that his bowels had to be removed
 main samaj hi nahin paa rahi thi ki ye sab kya ho rahaa he
 The narrator told what he was able to tell, being a woman, having the dignity of words
 lekin vaaki koi ye samaj bhi kaise saktaa he? kyonki jo hua, wo pashutaa kalpana, samaj, sabase pare hai
 a 23-year-old girl went into coma several times, undergoing 4 to 5 operations
 aant nikaal lee gai, dil kaa daura padaa use, brain injuri, uske angon ne kaam karnaa band kar diya
 Why? how? It was felt many times that the crowd standing at Jantar Mantar should also know all of them
 
 
 wo jo ham kah nahin paa rahe
 The one, who is unable to tell, the one who we got up to discuss after discussing among ourselves, the one who was told that there is cruelty
 maaloom to chale ki unke bich kii ek ladki achaanak se kaise unke bich nahin raheen
 Just because she was a girl
 lekin phir 17 se 29 disambar tak ke ghatnakram ko bhi dekha
 What happened to her was wrong, or what happened after that was more wrong? When she was admitted to the hospital, i called the head of an organization dealing with women and asked for time to meet her
 boli, "haa haa suna he maine, aap ghar aa jaao" mujhe apane ghar bulaakar mudde par sanjeeda madam kisi duusari jagah hi chali gayi
 That night i again saw the security system of this city sleeping soundly
 agle din jab kuch bachche apni mahila mukhiya se apana dar saajha karne gaye, to gadiyon ke kafile ke bich chalane vaali us mukhiya ke dar par un yuva chaatro par pani phenk diya gaya
 Those people who arrived with the pain of a girl without clothes for one hour in the cold night were also attacked with water in this cold, but those students still went soaked in water and water to the administration, despite their fears
 
 
 har haadase ke baad javabdehi se bachakar nikal jane vaali dilli police ko 35 saal ke itihaas main pehali baar apni hifaazat ke liye khud ko band daravaaje main samet lenaa padaa
 By dusk, everyone reached the door, which we call India Gate
 haath me mashaal jal rahi thi or sharir ke andar dil
 There were tears in the eye, but the questions raised on the lips
 in logon kaa koi netaa nahin tha
 Can say courage, but in reality it was the fear that brought them all here
 jaise shahar main koi bhediya ghus aayaa ho or sab ek jagah ikatthe hokar usase ladane, use maar bhagane kii tarkeeb talash rahe hon
 Some were also interested in it
 havan karaate photo khinchaate yaa phir aspataal jaakar photo khinchvaa aate
 Some of the pawns would call and tell that the so-called leader also got hurt in the lathicharge
 phir wo din bhi aayaa, jab yangistan chadh gaya rajpath ke seene par or ja panhucha raisina ke daravaaje
 Ask your President with great authority that you are watching, what is happening in this country? Now look, comfort us, tell us how safe we are here
 
 
 lekin ye kya aansu ponchney ke liye jahaan pahuche the, vahaan se hi aansu milane lage
 The children panicked, shocked that this is happening
 kuch to aise the, jinaki ankhon me sawaal tair rahaa tha ki mummy ne to kabhi thappad bhi nahin maaraa, ye kya he, ye kyon ho rahaa he? hamane aisa kya kiya
 
 
 But you can say anything can be only one percent mischievous element, but the courage of the youth present at that time is a true salute to their spirit, who despite being wet in water, drinking tear gas intermittently, crying even, Stayed there, for the girl whom he never saw nor could see
 shaam hote-hote pataa nahin kiskaa dhairya jabaab diya ki pathar barasane lage
 But after that one hour of chaos, the police were again there and the agitators too
 or phir wo kaala ravivaar bhi aayaa
 Sachin Tendulkar also could not divert the attention of the people
 
 
 bhaagate logon kii bheed, unke peeche danda lekar bhaagate pulicekarmi
 
 
 Sometimes surrounded, sometimes surrounded, dragging women, dragging men, policemen, the history of India Gate changed by evening
 
 
 wo kaali raat 16 disambar kii us kaali raat ko ek duusari tarah doharaa rahi thi
 The next morning India's picture did not change, the appearance of India Gate definitely changed
 india get us roj se kai din tak logon ko dekhne ko bhi naseeb naa hua
 Every path leading to it was closed to the general public
 kyon? ye sawaal bhi kaanoon-vyavastha ko chunauti mana jane laga
 The metro also ran at the behest of rulers
 aap hairat kariye, afsos jataaie, lekin aaazaad hindustan me ye jo ho rahaa tha, isse pehle kabhi nahin hua
 Yesterday's generation was sweating the government's forehead
 dilli sarkaar dilli police khulkar aamane saamne aa gai, taaki is javaabi karrwai me aap mudde ko peeche chhod den
 Then the soldier who was on duty was forced to perform the duty of saving the nose of his department even after being martyred
 or yahaan achaanak sarkaar or police-prashasan ek ho gaye
 He was given a final farewell with full state honors
 8 log daboch liye gaye, jo uski maut ke jimmedaar bataae gaye, lekin yahaan bhi kal kii ai peedhee seenaa thokkar saamne aa khadi hui, jo us sipaahi kii tabiyat bigadate vakt bhi uske saath thi
 The bets were played, and failed
 kuch ne aakar apni soch kaa parichay bhi diya or munh kii bhi khai
 And in the midst of all this, she was lying in a room in Safdarjung Hospital
 25 taarikh kii raat use dil kaa daura padaa, wo lagbhag khatm ho chuki thi
 It took many hours of effort
 gazab ichhashakti thi usamen, jeene kii raat main, jo phir saans chal padi
 The next day was again full of accusations on the police
 kai baaten saamne aa rahi thim, lekin jo intjaar ke baavjood pataa nahin chal paa rahaa tha, wo tha us ladki kaa haal
 Heart was sitting why medical bulletins were not being given despite the time
 lekin din dhalate hi us aspataal main halchal tej ho gai
 Something was going to happen, but what? People were only able to anticipate it

 If there is any problem related to planets in your horoscope, then let us know which deity will be best for which planet

 The Indian captain is the first batsman to score a century at the new Perth Stadium
 kohli ek calendar varsh main videshi sarajameen par 1000 ran puure karne vaale duniya ke 11wein or bharat ke tisare ballebaaj hai
 Kohli's feat, the fastest 25 centuries since Bradman in Tests, has been achieved by Rahul Dravid (1137 runs in 18 innings in 2002) and Mohinder Amarnath (1065 runs in 16 innings in 1983)

 After boycotting Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi for ten years, the US has said that it will act on Modi's visa application in line with the country's immigration laws, amid Britain's decision to change its policy

 ROCK-STEADY! - taran adarsh (@taran_adarsh) November 2, 2016 Karan Johar's film 'ae Dil Hai Mushkil' features Fawad as well as Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, Ranbir Kapoor and Anushka Sharma in the lead roles, which is Friday just before Diwali
 Was released on
 yah film bharat ke lagbhag 3000 cinemagharon main relies hui
 It is noteworthy that before the release of the film, Ajay Devgan had alleged that Kamal Rashid Khan (KRK) had taken Rs 25 lakh from Karan for tweeting in favor of Karan Johar's film 'ae Dil Hai Mushkil'
 vahiin, kamaal kaa kahana he ki devgan ne unhen karan johar kii film kii aalochana karne ke liye paison kii peshkash kii thi
 After suffering a humiliating defeat in two consecutive matches, the Indian team, which is on the verge of facing a clean sweep, on Sunday to save reputation in the third and last ODI international cricket match and to defeat Pakistan's hopes of winning the series 3–0
 Will land on chennai main aath wicket or kolkata main 85 ran se haar jhelane vaale bharat ko yadi apni sarazmi par kisi dwipaksheeya shrinkhalaa ke sabhi match ganvaane kii lajja se bachanaa he to uske ballebaajon ko acha pradarshan karnaa hoga
 India's well-known batsmen have shown disappointment in the last two matches, including captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who also disappointed the crores of cricket lovers of the country
 bharat ko isse pehle 1983 main apni dharti par westeindies se 0-5 se shikast jhelni padi thi
 Some batsmen from Pakistan, especially Nasir Jamshed, have been able to perform consistently but their pace bowling trio Junaid Khan, Mohammad Irfan and Umar Gul have made a difference
 in teenon ne ab tak bhartiya sheersh kram ko jhakzorne main ahm bhoomika nibhaai he
 No Indian batsman, except Captain Dhoni, stood at the crease for a long time in front of the Pakistani attack
 dilli ke chotii ke teen ballebaajon virendra sahvaag, gautam gambhir or viraat kohli ne ab tak do maichon main kramash: 35, 19 or chah ran banaaye hai
 With these three, not only the team but also Indian cricket lovers will be expected to perform well on their home ground
 dhoni ne bhi mana he ki sheersh kram ke in teenon ballebaajon main kam se kam kisi ek ko madhyakram ke ballebaajon kaa saath dena hoga
 What is worrying for India is that after the failure of Sehwag, Gambhir and Kohli in the top order, none of Yuvraj Singh, Rohit Sharma and Suresh Raina have been able to play an anchor in the middle order
 isliye is match main na sirf bhartiya team balki bhartiya ballebaajon kii pratishtha bhi daanv par lagi he
 Dhoni's form is definitely good news for India
 bhartiya captain ne pehle match main naabad 113 or duusare match main naabad 54 ran banaaye lekin unhen duusare chor se sahyog nahin mil paaya he
 Pakistan is eyeing a clean sweep for the 14th time in a series of three or more matches
 pakistan apane desh se baahar ab tak keval zimbabwe, bangladesh or westeindies main hi shrinkhalaa ke sabhi match jeetne main kaamyaab rahaa he
 Its captain misbah-ul-haq also said that the team will leave no stone unturned to win the match at Kotla
 misabah ne kaha ki bharat ke khilaaf koi bhi jeet khaas hoti he
 If we managed to win 3–0, it would be a big achievement
 pakistan kii taraf se yadi gendbaajon ne mukhya antar paidaa kiya he to uske salaami ballebaaj jamshed ne donon match main ballebaaji vibhaag kii jimmedaari sanbhale rakhi
 Jamshed, who scored 101 in Chennai and 106 in Kolkata, is looking to match Zaheer Abbas and Saeed Anwar's record for centuries in three consecutive matches
 jahir ne yah karnama 1982-83 main bharat ke khilaaf hi kiya tha
 The Indian bowlers will also try to draw inspiration from the last 25 overs in Kolkata in which they had bundled the entire Pakistan team
 bhuvenshwar kumaar, ashok dinda or ishanth sharma kii bhartiya tej gendbaaji kii tikdi ko pakistani gendbaajon se bhi sabak lene kii jarurat he
 Kotla's pitch is not likely to get much quickness and bounce like Chepak or Eden Gardens and hence here India may insist on strengthening the spin department
 pakistan gendbaaji akraman main haalanki kisi tarah kii badlaav kii sambhaavna nahin he kyonki uske paas said ajmal or hafeez ke rup main do upyogi spinner hai
 There is a winter in North India and the pitch will remain damp even though the match starts at 12 noon
 aise main toss phir se ahm bhoomika nibhaayega
 In such a situation, the fast bowlers can get help initially and here too the team winning the toss is likely to field first
 jahaan tak ricard kii baat he to kotla main ab tak bharat or pakistan ke bich ekmaatr vanade match 2005 main khelaa gaya tha jisamen pakistan ne jeet darj kii thi
 Both possible teams are as follows
 bharat-mahendra singh dhoni, virendra sahvaag, gautam gambhir, viraat kohli, yuvaraj singh, suresh raina, ravinder jadeja, ravichandran aswin, bhubaneshwar kumaar, ishanth sharma, ashok dinda, anjiky rahane, rohit sharma, amit mishra or shami ahamed
 pakistan-misbah-ul-haq, Nasir Jamshed, Mohammad Hafeez, Azhar Ali, Younis Khan, Shoaib Malik, Kamran Akmal, Saeed Ajmal, Umar Gul, Junaid Khan, Mohammad Irfan, Sohail Tanvir, Omar Akmal, Anwar Ali, Harish Sohail, Imran Farhat And Zulfikar Babar

 The incident is from Bakhtiyarpur in Patna district, where the NDRF team came to know that Neetu Devi, a woman in Roopas Manjhi village, is groaning with pain
 lekin use aspataal pahunchaana mushkil ho rahaa he
 Nobody could understand what to do if they did
 kaise mahila ko aspataal pahunchaaya jaae
 There was no way to get out of the village because of the flood
 isi bich usee gaanv kesanjit paswannam ke yuvak ne isaki soochna andiaref team ko di
 As soon as the information was received, the NDRF team reached Roopas Manjhi village
 nitu devi ko andiaref ke javaanon ne ghar se nikaal kar naav par bithaaya or gaanv se baahar laayaa
 When the ambulance did not arrive on time after being brought out of the village, the NDRF personnel took Neetu Devi to Bakhtiyarpur Sadar Hospital in the official vehicle of the officer Bakhtiyarpur
 aspataal pahunchane ke baad doctoron kii team ne nitu devi kaa ilaaj shuru kiya or nitu ne ek bachche ko janm diya jo bilkul swasth he
 For the last five days, Patna and adjoining areas have been facing the devastation of floods
 baadh peedit apni jaan bachaane main lage hai or un sabon kii madad main laga he andiaref kii team
 In all these, the story of Bhubaneswar Paswan of the flood is different, even here, if the team of NDRF was not there, it would not be known if Bhubaneshwar had to spend many days hungry on the tree
 bhubaneshwar pichley 72 ghante se nagn avasthaa main apni jaan bachaane bhukhe-pyaase ped par baitha he
 NDRF teams were taking their boat from that side and Bhubaneswar made a noise to plead for his life
 bhubaneshwar kii aawaaj sun naav lekar andiaref ke jawan ped ke paas pahunche
 First clothes were given to Bhubaneshwar for wearing, then the NDRF soldiers lowered him from the tree, then the NDRF team took Bhubaneswar to the nearby relief camp
 ab bhubaneshwar apane parivaar waalon kii khoj main laga he
 In fact, the flood waters entered Bhubaneswar's house on Saturday night causing panic and everyone started running away
 bhubaneshwar bhi bhaaga
 But due to not getting fast, water started taking Bhubaneswar in his arms, which caused him to get washed away
 pani kii dhar itani tej thi ki use samaj nahin aa rahaa tha ki wo kare to kya kare
 In the midst of all this, he saw a tree on which he climbed to save his life and for the last 72 hours he was struggling with life and death by drinking flood water on the same tree

 com / gqjglgag0f ol india majalise ittehadul muslimin (AIMIM) ke adhyaksh or saansad asaduddin ovaisi ne kaha he ki jammu-kashmir main dhara 370 par bijepi isliye chup he, kyonki maujuuda vidhansabha chunaav main muslimon kaa bhi vot hasil karnaa chaahati he
 Owaisi said this during the program 'sidhi Baat' till date
 asaduddin ovaisi ne kaha ki pradhanmantri narendra modi ke bare main unki raay jo pehle thi, vahi aaj bhi he or vah kabhi nahin badalegi
 Owaisi also said during the general election that if Modi becomes Prime Minister, it will not be good for the country
 ovaisi ne kaha, 'apane us bayaan par main aaj bhi kaayam hum
 They are listening to the statements of their ministers, in which language and style they are talking
 sakshi maharaj ne bayaan diya ki saare madrase aatankwaad kii factory hai
 Then an attempt was made to provoke people by spreading the word of love-jihad
 duusari taraf aresas kaa yah bayaan ki ham hindu raashtra banaaenge
 Before 2019 we will build Ram temple
 phir modi ji kaa lalakile se 15 agast par yah kahana ki mujhe 10 saal kaa mortorium dijie
 Now the country has to decide
 avam ne unako vot diya he
 Happy them! But our opinion today is the same tomorrow
 'jab poocha gaya ki bijepi to sashastr bal vishesh shaktiyaan adhinium (AFSPA) va anuchhed 370 hataane or ram mandir jaise muddon par chup he, lihaaja uskaa focus sirf sushasan or vikaas par lagata he or lagata hi nahin ki hindutv uske agenda main he
 What will you say on this? Owaisi said, 'BJP has not removed the talk of repealing Article 370 from its core agenda
 vah kashmir main chunaav jeetne ke liye abhi is mudde par khamosh he
 The BJP does not clearly say that it has forgotten Article 370 or the Ram temple
 aisa vah kah bhi nahin sakati, kyonki usne dotarafa phayda uthaane kii soch rakhi he
 He said, "if AFSPA is to be removed, then they should bring the bill in Parliament
" kam se kam kashmir ke shahari ilaakon se hi AFSPA hataaen
 The Parliament session is still in progress
 magar ye log aisa kuch nahin karenge
 i think the BJP will show its true face once the last phase of voting is held in Jammu
 'ovaisi se sawaal poocha gaya ki vivaadaaspad muddon par pradhanmantri khud kuch nahin bol rahe hai? is par aapaki kya pratikriya he? jawaab main ovaisi ne kaha, 'bijepi main sabakaa kaam banta hua he
 There is RSS, VHP, Bajrang Dal and BJP is a political wing of all this
 siyaasi phaayde ke liye, logon ko bahakaane ke liye aspasht bayaan dena inaki fitrat rahi he
 The Prime Minister can never go against rss's statement of Hindu Rashtra
 pradhanmantri khud kehete hai ki vah aresas se aae hai
 Modi says in New York that 1200 years of slavery have gained independence
 mulk to 1947 main aaazaad hua tha
 But they talk about 650 years of Mughal rule and before that, was it slavery? See what kind of statements are coming
 ''congress or NCP kaa aarope he ki aapaki party ke chunaav main utarane se bijepi ko phayda hota he
 They even say that you came to the polls on the instigation of the RSS? On this question, Owaisi said, 'maharashtra has a total of one crore Muslim voters
 matdaan 60 fisadi hua
 That means 60 lakh Muslims voted
 maine 24 ummidavaar utaare the
 There were also five non-muslims
 mujhe kul paanch lakh 24 hajaar muslim vot mili
 The remaining 55 lakh Muslim votes were called
 saare vot congress, NCP ko hi to mili
 Despite this, why did Baba Siddiqui and Nawab Malik lose? How did Abdul Sattar win? The truth is that he ruled for 15 years, but 30% of the undertrials in Maharashtra jails are Muslims
 ek fisadi muslim ladkiyaan bhi graduate nahin hai
 Where did the situation change? And take down the candidates, then they say they have gone to the RSS
 badakismati ye he ki bijepi kahe to main rashtravaadi hum or duusari partiyaan certificate den, to main dharmanirpeksh hum
 "do you think the Muslim vote will be gathered around you in the coming four-five years?" On this question, Owaisi said, 'I am not a leader of Muslims
 musalamaanon ke netaa pandit nehru, bahadur shastri, manmohan singh, lalu prasad yadav, mulaayam singh yadav or sharad pavaar hai
 'owaisi was questioned,' About eight-ten percent of Muslim youth are in favor of BJP, because Modi is talking about development today
 kahin aapako apni siyaasi dukaan band hone kaa dar to nahin he?' is par ovaisi ne kaha, 'vot dene se koi kisi ko roak nahin saktaa
 But this charge is baseless
 bijepi ke 440 ummidavaaron main sirf aath musalmaan the, or sabhi haare
 Answer why the BJP could not win Shahnawaz Hussain
 baaki saat kii jamaanat hi jabt ho gai
 That is because people know the ideology of BJP and RSS
 sabhi log jhaanse main nahin aa sakate
 On the Prime Minister's attitude towards Pakistan, Owaisi said, "there is instability everywhere in our neighborhood
" sarhad par golibari hui
 The soldiers were martyred
 dekhnaa he ki yah tanaav kaise kam hota he
 On the last day of SAARC, the Prime Minister shook hands with Nawaz Sharif
 ab dekhte hai ki baatcheet ke raste bhi khulte hai yaa nahin
 'questioned,' Do you think ISIS will be able to distract the youth through internet? ' In response to this, Owaisi said, 'I have not only criticized ISIS, but also by big Muslim scholars
 ye islam ke naam par dhabba he
 Murder the innocent ham kisi bhi aisi takat ko panpate hue dekhnaa nahin chaahate jo mulk kii akhandta ke liye khatra ho
 Four boys were lost

 Who is the second one in this era, who will say so truthfully about himself

 However 24 greetings of Sawan, Alia, the highway of life and cuteness acting is very long, keep going on it

 Salman and Aamir, two of Bollywood's most popular Khans, maintain a lot of brotherhood, but the two do not miss any opportunity to drag each other on the issue of marriage
 ab tak kunare salmaan khan ke liye acchhee ladki khojane ke bare main haal hi main aamir se poocha gaya, to unka jawaab tha, ‘‘main salmaan ke liye ladki khojoongaa, lekin pehle vah mujhe vishwaas dilaae ki vah usase vivaah karegaa or is bare main aage koi charchaa nahin hogi
 He was asked if he would choose a girl for Salman from the Hindi film industry
 is par mistar parafectionist ne kaha, ‘‘pehle vah mujhe aashwaasan to de ki vah us ladki ko ‘naa’ nahin kahegaa
 When Salman agrees, i will tell him about the girl
 ’’purv main aamir ne kaha tha ki salmaan kii shaadi karaane kaa ek hi tarika he or vah yah he ki salmaan ke haath baandhakar use sidhe ‘mandap’ main pahunchaa diya jaae
 How can Sallu Mian stay behind Aamir's sarcasm
 unhone fouran jawaab diya, ‘‘main to unke haath baandhakar yah sunishchit karne ja rahaa hum ki vah ab dobaaraa vivaah na karen
 '' Aamir has married twice
 march main aamir ne salmaan ke janmdin par kaha ki vah apane 45 saal ke mitra or sahyogi superstar ke vivaah kaa intjaar kar rahe hai
 Aamir had said, "I am waiting for Salman's wedding
" meraa maananaa he ki har koi besabri se uske vivaah kaa intjaar kar rahaa he
 The day he gets married will be a 'special day' for all of us
 uske aasapaas kai hasinaayen hai isliye uske paas chayan kaa vikalp bhi he

 Earlier this year, Facebook launched a special photo sharing and sync app 'moments' which was not given due consideration by the users
 isse pehle fasebuk ne massenger ap launch kii thi, par yugers tab fasebuk ap se hi ek-duusare ko massej karte the
 Because of this, people were not interested in the Messenger app

 The Supreme Court, taking cognizance of the letter petition filed on behalf of the group of 46 lawyers, said that the law stipulated that no lawyer, their group or association could stop any lawyer from appearing for the accused in the case
 chif justise kii bench ne kaha ki agar vakil apane client kakesasvikaar karata he to uski jimmedaari he ki wo uske liye pesh ho
 If it is stopped then it is a hindrance in the legal process and it will be considered as a hindrance in getting justice

 ghar kii safai karte samay sabase pareshaani hoti he diwaar ke konon yaa istemaal na hone vaali chizon par lage makadi ke jaale
 They also spoil the elegance of a very well decorated house
 kai logon ko to makadi ke jaale hataane main bahut dar lagata he
 But with the help of some methods they can be easily removed
 jaane jaale hataane ke aise hi kuch asantips:sabase pehle hataaen makadimakadi ke jaale hataane se pehle dekh len ki kahin us jaale main koi makadi na ho
 Because as soon as you clean the webs, the spider will run away and hide and will increase your work
 isliye sabase pehle keede maarane vaali dawa kaa istemaal karke makadi yaa anya keedon ko hataa den
 Cover the stuff placed near the wall and the spider webs become very large if not removed
 agar aisa he to jaale hataane se pehle paas rakhi chizon ko dhak dentaki ye gandi hone se bachi rahen
 Removal of the Kindle should be prepared in advance for all the items for removal, such as chairs, gloves, brooms and dusting pans
 west paper kaa karen istemaadgar jaal ke andar makadi he or aap use hataa nahin paa rahe hai to ise jaldi se paper main lapet kar phenk den
 One can wear gloves while doing so
 lakdi yaa kantedaar tahani he bade kaam kijale agar pahunch se dur hai to ek lambii lakdi main toilet paper lapetakar aap aaraam se makadi ke jaalon ko saaf kar sakate hai
 If the wood is thorny, it is even better
 jaale hataane ke tul bhi laa sakate habgar aapkaa bajet acha he or aapgharelu upayon se bachanaa chaahate hanto bazaar main milane vaali home dusting kit aapako madad kar sakate hai

 udhar, everest base camp par duniyabar ke parvatarohiyon kaa jamaavada
 All were set to conquer the highest peak of the world
 major ares jamwaal ke netritv main bhartiya sena ke abhiyaan dal ke saath enditivi kii team abhyaas ke liye khumbhu glacier kii ore nikali, tabhi achaanak kalejaa chirati awaz ke saath dharti jaise kaanp uthi
 There was chaos all around
 ek bhayanak jaljla puure nepal ko hilaa gaya
 The Himalayan peaks also trembled
 everest par maujuud enditivi ke aamir rafik ne bataaya, pehle arthquek hua
 All the mountains around the base camp are glaciers
 
 
 ve glacier tut kar ek saath base camp ke upar baras pade to jitne bhi tents the, sab dhwast ho gaye
 Corpses and blood everywhere
 
 
 
 Only the clothes we wore were left
 hamaare paas kuch nahin bachaa
 Jeevan se jung: Watch the full video here everest base camp ke aasapaas shikharon se barf kaa toofaan neeche utarane laga
 The iceberg broke from Pumori Peak and started sliding downwards
 enditivi ke aamir rafique ne bataaya ki abhi ham everest base camp par bhartiya sena ke 30 logon ke saath the
 We went to Base Camp-1 only
 jab ham waapas aa rahe the, itane main khumbhu glacier, jo sabase dangeras world main maane jate hai, ve hilne lage
 There was an avalanche from both our left and right sides and the entire army team which was under the leadership of Major Jamwal said that you hold the rope and stay down
 ham do minute tak rahe or kuch der intjaar karte rahe
 
 
 
 abhi ham marane vaale hai
 
 
 Then someone said, run away
 
 
 
 On seeing the white sheet of ice on the slope of Khumbu Glacier, it started bursting from many places
 pairon ke neeche thos barf dhansane lagi
 Any snow crack could swallow the climbers
 raste main bichhi is safed maut ke bich se nikalne ke liye tezi or sabar donon kii zarurat thi
 That's when the snowstorm passed from above
 
 
 
 Aamir told, when we were running down, a snow storm came with the run down, due to which we had to sit down and we covered our mouths
 jab hamane paanch minute ke baad apni ankhen kholin to hamaare upar paanch se das inch tak barf jamaa thi
 Now we came downstairs, when we reached the base camp, there was our Rakesh Solanki sir, who covered the base camp
 base camp main jo upar se himaskhalan hua tha, vah utarkar base camp par aa gaya
 
 
 Aamir said, for two minutes we felt like we were waiting for death with our eyes closed
 khumbhu glacier par jab aap khadey hon or aapke chaaron ore se barf kii chattaane gir rahi hon or aap jis glacier par khadey hon, vah bhi hill rahaa he to aap soch sakate hai hamane maut ko kitne qareeb se dekha he
 Major Jamwal in the Indian Army said, when we reached the bottom, we saw everything was safe
 kuch nahin bachaa he
 We had nothing left of ourselves
 hamaari bagal main echaare he, vahaan par cazmultiz lagaataar aani shuru ho gai thim
 There was a scream around Everest Base Camp
 rakesh solanki ne bataaya, ham saat se aath log neeche the
 Then at around 12:40 Earthquake arrived
 jaise ham log baahar tent se nikle or dekh hi rahe the, maine camera nikaal kar shooting karnaa shuru hi kiya tha ki utane main hamaare saamne bahut nazadik puraa barf kaa ek pahaad tut chukaa tha or vah hamaari taraf aane laga
 We left the camera right then and ran to save our lives
 mujhe ek choti-si chattan mil gai
 i sat behind him
 vahaan par main or ek sherpa bache
 The whole tent came and fell on us, that is why our shelter was done and we were saved
 vah sab jaise hi khatm hua to turant hamane camera nikaala
 When i started shooting, i saw everything was destroyed and the base camp was in very bad condition
 bahut zyada log ghayal hue the, sir kii choton se qareeb 22 log maare ja chuke the
 Major Jamwal said that no one had expected that inside the base camp, that too would be an avalanche from Pumori that would blow up the base camp
 iske baad mount everest base camp bikharaa padaa tha
 The climbers' tents were devastated by the snowstorm
 khaane-pine se lekar parvatarohan tak kaa saamaan saikadon meter dur kahin barf main dab chukaa tha
 Then the process of the arrival of the injured started
 bhartiya sena kaa abhiyaan dal turant raahat or bachaav main jute gaya
 Major Jamwal told that, we divided ourselves into two teams
 maine ek doctor kii team banaai
 He shared eight men with him
 
 
 or baaki team ko maine apana saamaan dhundne ke liye lagaaya, jo ki bahut jaruri tha, kyonki hamaara sab kuch ud chukaa tha
 Actually, it was necessary to collect scattered things in the storm
 ye saamaan vahaan maujuud jidangiyon ko bachaae rakhane kii door tha
 Only the injured could be treated
 sena kii team ne ek-ek kar sab jutaya
 Tents were renovated
 kuch hi der main bhartiya sena kaa field hospital shuru ho gaya tha
 According to Major Jamwal, we had a lot of medicines
 echaare se bhi zyaada davaaiyaan hamaare paas thi
 We had very capable doctors and they helped a lot
 puri raat hamaara doctor ghayalon saath rahaa
 He was handling the head injuries department, which was a main department, as most of the climbers suffered head injuries
 barf kaa toofaan apane saath chattaane or pathar todakar jo laayaa tha
 After this, the work of sending climbers who received serious injuries through helicopters immediately sent them to the capital Kathmandu or the nearest hospital in Lukla
 himaskhalan ke baad base camp par maujuud kai sherpa apni tiimon ko chhodkar waapas nikal gaye
 There were two reasons for this
 ek to ye ki himaskhalan main maare gaye 22 parvatarohiyon main se 16 sherpa the or doosraa nepal main ai tabaahi main kaiyon ke ghar afat tut padi thi
 Aamir told that after that when we came down, all the Sherpas were leaving the base camp as soon as we came down, because last year there were 16 Sherpa deaths in the avalanche
 is saal bhi vahi hua
 16 out of 19 were Sherpas
 saare ke saare sherpa jab bhaagane lage to saare parvatarohi hi bache rah gaye
 Climbers don't know that much
 is bich kai videshi parvatarohiyon kii timen ab bhi base camp par nahin lauti thim, jo parvatarohi ek do din pehle hi everest kii ore chadhaai kar chuke the, sabko unka intazaar tha
 Everest's base camp was cut from Camp One Camp Two
 sabko waapas lautne kii jaldi thi, nahin thi to sirf bhartiya sena ke abhiyaan dal ko
 Aamir told that the Indian Army played a great role here
 ve bhi nikal sakate the, lekin nahin nikle, kyonki vahaan par jo log fanse hue the, pehle unhen dhundhakar kar raahat pahunchnaa jaruri tha, kyonki kisi ke paas koi khaanaa-pinaa nahin bachaa tha
 Only the food that was left with the Indian Army was distributed
 base camp par kuch videshi parvatarohiyon ke saath bhartiya sena morcha sanbhale rahi
 The war of life continued at Everest Base Camp
 everest base camp par utre barf ke toofaan main jo batch gaye wo bhagwaan kaa shukriya adaa kar rahe the
 Meanwhile, small earthquakes coming one after the other were frightening everyone
 bukamp ke saath hi sabaki nigaah oonchi chotiyon par chali jaati ye dekhne ke liye ki kahin phir maut barf ke toofaan kii shakl main neeche to nahin utar rahi
 Major Jamwal told, we are on sentry duty
 agar koi aisi awaz aati he, teenon taraf, aap pomori kii baat kar sakate hai, lola kii baat kar sakate hai yaa nubse kii, jis taraf se bhi avalanche aayega, ye ladke hamen saavdhaan karenge
 The first day passed as usual
 agali subah bache hue logon ko nikaalane kaa kaam phir shuru hua
 Meanwhile, in the afternoon another big earthquake shook everyone
 dharti ke baad ab aasmaan kii baari thi
 The base camp was surrounded by clouds and snowfall started
 aamir ne bataaya ki lagaataar barfbaari ho rahi tha
 Tremors were coming in every day and night
 bhartiya sena teen santariyon ko lagaakar rakhti thi, jo raat bhar camp ke aasapaas rahete the
 As soon as the voice of Evlansh was coming, they used to shout at us, get out
 
 
 to ham shelter dhundte the
 Used to bow in front of the stone
 tippaniyan Gradually, the remaining teams at the base camp began to consolidate their operations, but the Indian Army expedition was still engaged in relief and rescue work at the base camp
 is bich base camp se hamaare lautne kaa vaqt bhi aa gaya
 With good heart, we bid farewell to the colleagues present there
 25 april, 2015 ko everest base camp kii wo syah yaad hameshaa dimaag main tazaa rahegi, lekin ham lautenge ek nae haunsale ke saath, ek nayaa mukaam, ek nai oonchai hasil karne ke liye
 
 
 Aamir Rafiq of NDTV present on Everest said, Earthquake happened first
 base camp ke around jitne bhi mountains hai, glacier hai
 
 
 When they broke the glacier and rained together on the base camp, all the tents were destroyed
 chaaron taraf laashen or khun
 
 
 
 sirf vahi kapade bache, jo hamane pahane the
 We have nothing left
 jindagi se jang : yahaan dekhie puraa video Snow storms descended from the peaks around Everest Base Camp
 pumori peak se himkhand tuutakar neeche kii ore phisalane lage
 Aamir Rafiq of NDTV said that right now we were with 30 people of Indian Army at Everest Base Camp
 ham base camp-1 tak hi gaye the
 While we were returning, the Khumbhu Glacier, which is considered the most dangerous world, started moving
 hamaare left-rhite donon sids se himaskhalan hone laga or puri army kii team jo major jamwaal kii leadership main thi, kaha ki aap rope pakadakar rakho or neeche raho
 We stayed for two minutes and waited for some time
 
 
 
 We are about to die now
 
 
 tabhi kisi ne kaha, bhaago-bhaago
 
 
 
 khumbhu glacier kii dhalaan par barf kii safed chadar dekhte hi dekhte kai jagah se fatne lagi
 Solid snow began to sink under the feet
 koi bhi him daraar parvatarohiyon ko nigal sakati thi
 It took both speed and patience to get out of the midst of this white death on the way
 tabhi upar se barf kaa toofaan guzara
 
 
 
 aamir ne bataaya, jab ham neeche bhaag rahe the to neeche bhaagane ke saath barf kaa tufaan aayaa, jisaki vajah se hamen neeche baithna padaa or hamane apana munh dhakaa
 When we opened our eyes after five minutes, we had five to ten inches of snow
 ab ham neeche bhaag-bhaag ke aae, jab ham base camp par pahunche, vahaan par hamaare rakesh solanki sar the, jinhone base camp ko cover kiya
 The avalanche that took place at the base camp landed and landed at the base camp
 
 
 aamir ne kaha, hamen do minute ke liye laga jaise ham aankh band karke maut kaa intazaar kar rahe the
 When you are standing on the Khumbu Glacier and there are rocks of snow falling around you and the glacier you are standing on is also shaking, then you can imagine how close we have seen to death
 bhartiya sena main major jamwaal ne bataaya, jab ham neeche pahunche to hamane dekha sab safaa he
 there's nothing left
 hamaara khud kaa kuch nahin bachaa tha
 We have HRA on our side, Casualties started frequenting there
 everest base camp par chaaron ore cheekh pukaar machi thi
 Rakesh Solanki told, We were seven to eight people down

 hamaare left-rhite donon sids se himaskhalan hone laga or puri army kii team jo major jamwaal kii leadership main thi, kaha ki aap rope pakadakar rakho or neeche raho

 It took both speed and patience to get out of the midst of this white death on the way

 When you are standing on the Khumbu Glacier and there are rocks of snow falling around you and the glacier you are standing on is also shaking, then you can imagine how close we have seen to death
