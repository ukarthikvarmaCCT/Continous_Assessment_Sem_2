 The sun has gone out 
 
 
 
 bhartiya samskruti jin-jin chizon se gadabada jaati he, un sabhi chizon ko savere vaali gaadi se landan ravaanaa kiya ja rahaa he
 You have kissed the (bond) heroine in all the films that have come before Pahlaj, in fact, the earlier Pahlajas were alienated from the dominant Indian culture
 
 
 
 Rasranjan was doing porn scenes like kissing
 
 
 
 No stopping the kiss
 
 
 magar chumban kaa kaal agar lanbaa ho jaae to dikkat he
 
 
 Quoting sources, the newspapers have written that in Indian films too, the kissing period is being reduced
 ye mat samajhnaa ki pehlaaj sahab ko pashchim se nafrat he

 The comments haal hi unhone ek video banaaya tha, pradhanmantri kii shaan main

 maaloom ho ki gujarat vidhansabha chunaav main gramin ilaakon se vot bank kam hone ke baad sarkaar yah bilkul bhi nahin chaahegi ki aane vaale chunaavon main use nuksaan ho
 Therefore, before the elections, the government can play the trump card in areas like agriculture, loans and jobs

 This region is also the most important in the development of the country

 Asaram is now a rapist
 shahjahanpur ke parivaar kaa sangharsh anjaam tak pahunch chukaa he
 But years before this battle, the face of Asaram's stigma had begun to appear
 uski ayyashi ke tamaam kisse ashram se baahar nikalne lage the
 To understand this, eight years ago, Asaram had revealed his truth on the intelligence camera
 asaram ko uske kukarmon kii sajaa tak pahunchane main jodhpur kii adaalat ne jin tathyon ko saboot ke taur par sweekaar kiya usamen 'ajtak' kaa ye sting oparation bhi tha
 In this sting, Asaram Khud is opening the world of his sins, he is openly demonstrating his clout and his power and telling on the intelligence camera what he can do
 'ajtak' kanoon ke madadgaar ke is aitihaasik is sting oparation ko dobaaraa isliye lekar aayaa he ki aap asaram ke kalank kii kaali chhaayaon se khud rubaru ho saken, or ab yah sab bolne ke liye asaram ab kabhi saamne nahin aayega
 In September 2010, an undercover woman reporter pleaded with Asaram to take her asylum to understand Asaram's illnesses
 is prastaav par asaram kii ankhon main laal dore tairne lage the, wo turant mahila ke saath gopneey yojana banane lagata he
 We were surprised to learn that Asaram, such a great Baba who dances in Ramabhakti, is actually a heartfelt type of adventure
 bhakton ke saamne naachne vaale asaram ne andercover reporter ke saamne shaleenta ke saare kapade utaarata ja rahaa tha

 'ajtak' ke khufia camere par darj ho rahaa asaram darasal ek aisakambhakt asaramtha jiske liye rambhakt hona uske paap kaa pardaa tha
 The stories of Asaram's sage are not just this
 aarope he ki auraten uski kamajori hai
 But what he himself said on Aaj Tak's camera was astonishing
 ab asaram ko uske kiye kii sajaa mil chuki he, asaram ke kukarmon kii pole kholane main 'ajtak' kii bhoomika ko adaalat ne bhi tavajjo di he

 Union Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar continues to make strange statements
 mahangaai par unhone ek baar phir janata ko hairaan kar dene vaala bayaan de daalaa he
 This time, Sharad Pawar has said that the minister has nothing to do with inflation
 unka kahana he ki subjiyon ke daam to kisaan tay karte hai
 However, even though the economy of the country and the world is busy in the forehead of why inflation is rising rapidly, Sharad Pawar has once again tried to make his own statement
 bachapan hameshaa or harek kaa sunaharaa hota he, phir chaahe wo koi bhi ho
 Some people keep beautiful memories of their childhood in the box of words, and some keep them in the colloquial loafing
 bachapan main koi mahaan nahin hota magar bachapan main mili sikh or sanskaar ke saath umr ke har daur main kiye gaye faisle kisi bhi vyakti ko mahanata ke raste par agrasar jarur kar detaa he
 One such memoir is of the autobiography of RK Narayan
 
 
 meri jivan gaatha
 My life story, published by Rajpal and Sankha, is a book in which the entire story of the storyteller, who became a great writer of RK Narayan or, by saying the feelings of ordinary people with very soft hands, traces them, reflects his whole life Stayed with jise unhone kabhi khud se dur nahin kiya or shaayad yahi vajah he ki aarake narayan ke tamaam lekhan main koi bhi pathak badi aasaani se unka bachapan, unki nani kaa ghar, ghar main paley jaanwaron se mulaakaat yaa phir unke baalpan ke kisi mitra yaa rishtedaar ko dekh saktaa he
 
 
 And can feel
 ye aarake narayan ke lekhan kii khubi he ki wo apni har ek baat ko behad gudgudane vaale andaaj main kuch yun bayaan kar dete hai ki padhane vaala yaa sunne vaala muskuraae bagaiyr nahin rah saktaa
 It is the skill of the writing of RK Narayan that despite writing in English language, the smell of soil of India and its native style is not reduced at all
 unki is aatmakatha ko padhane ke baad is baat kaa bhi khulaasa ho jaataa he ki wo kis maahaul or kis tarah ke parivesh main paley bade
 This book also shows that picture of his childhood, how the insistence on breaking the mischief of children and the restrictions of discipline gives rise to a new story
 jivan ke sangharsh ko chitrit karne vaala unka ye sansmaran behad anokhaa prathit hota he, jab usamen bachapan kii avishkaarak fitrat nazar aati he
 How the character of Malgudi Days' lord became a part of his writing and how the character changed into the entire novel by doing mole, it is depicted in such a beautiful and simple accent that it inspires further reading without being cumbersome
 jo is baat kaa bhi saboot he ki ek kirdaar ko taiyaar karne ke peeche lekhak kii bhoomika kya ho sakati he, use kis kis tarah se daur se guzaranaa padataa he
 RK Narayan did not take any moment to revive that moment of his life with words, the part of which people often hide away in shame and haya
 javaani ke us daur kaa zikr unhone bakhubi or khubasurat andaaj main kiya jab sangharsh ke daur main jawan ladke ko prem rog kii asambhav sambhaavnaaen gher leti he
 His story, written in his 80 thousand words story, became a film of The Guide and associated with its promotion and dissemination seems very interesting and like a film screenplay
 meri jivan gaatha main aarake narayan ne us kisse se bhi munh nahin modaa jab unhen neuyork se kisi apradhi kii tarah nikalne ko vivash hona padaa
 But this was the most beautiful aspect of this saga, which gave different proofs of her being a native
 duniya bhar ke mahaan lekhakon kii jamaat kaa hissaa banane ke baavjood jab lekhak is baat main sukun talaashe ki use nadi kaa kinaaraa, kheton main hal ko chalata hua dekhne, fawda chalaanaa or mitti godne main zyada sukh miltaa he to mahasoos hota he ki lekhak kii urvartaa aseem he or shaayad yahi uske mahaan hone kaa beej bhi he

 There is always a ruckus between Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and the police of the state, but Kejriwal has ignored the demands of his own party mlas for the Delhi Police
 aam aadmi party ke 30 vidhayakon ne maang kii thi ki dilli police ke shahid javaanon ko ek karod kaa muaavja dene vaali niti se baahar kiya janaa chahie
 This demand was made by AAP mlas accusing Delhi Police of negligence in the attack on Arvind Kejriwal at Delhi Secretariat
 vidhayakon ne yah bhi aarope lagaaya tha ki dilli police bijepi ke ishaare par kaam kar rahi he
 Thirty mlas had demanded from Arvind Kejriwal that the Delhi Police be excluded from the compensation policy of one crore rupees, but Arvind Kejriwal rejected the demand of his own mlas
 shahid ke parivaar ko diya chekashanivaar ko dilli ke palam ilaake main mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal or parivahan mantri kailash gahalot ne dilli police ke shahid jawan virendra singh or deepak kumaar ke parivaar ko ek karod rupee kii sahaayta raashi kaa check diya
 At the same event, Kejriwal said from the forum that he does not agree with this demand of the mlas
 kejariwal sarkaar ne dilli main rahane vaale bhartiya sena, airforce, navy, andiaref, dilli fire vibhaag, dilli police or para military ke javaanon ko duty par shahid hone kii sthiti main parivaar ko ek karod rupee kaa muaavja dene kii yojana shuru kii thi
 'delhi Police Like My Family' When Kejriwal was attacked and thrown chilly by an unknown young man in Delhi Secretariat, the Aam Aadmi Party mlas demanded that the Delhi Police be dropped from the scheme
 kejariwal ne shanivaar ko party vidhayakon kii is maang ko khaarij karte hue kaha, 'haal hi main mujh par do baar hamalaa hua

 He said that the purpose of imposing import duties is mainly to prevent the transfer of US technology and intellectual property to China, which will save American jobs
 trump ne kaha, "america galat tareeke se apni praudyogiki or bauddhik sampada ko khona ab bardaasht nahin kar saktaa he
 "the US president announced in March that Washington would impose a fine of 50 billion on imports of Chinese goods
 trump ne us samay kaha, "hamaare saath bauddhik sampada kii chori kii badi samasya he

 In Uttar Pradesh, the new friendship of 'aunt-nephew' seems to be deepening
 ye dosti philhal itani 'pakki' he ki rajyasabha chunaav main mili haar bhi koi asar nahin daal rahi
 Despite the defeat of her candidate Bhimrao Ambedkar in the Rajya Sabha elections, the way Mayawati has expressed her full confidence in Akhilesh, it is clear that this alliance will last long
 or agar ye dosti lambii chali to aam chunaav main bijepi ke liye upi main badi aadchan aa sakati he
 Mayawati said on Saturday that the bjp's problems have increased due to the coming together of the BSP-SP
 basapa-sapa gathjod todane ke liye bijepi tamaam tarah kii koshish kar rahi he
 The BSP supremo said on the guest house scandal that SP president Akhilesh Yadav cannot be said to be responsible for the incident, as he was not in politics at that time
 shuukravaar raat chunaav jeetne ke fouran baad yogi adityanath ne jis tarah se sapa par tanj ksaa tha ki sapa sirf lenaa jaanati he dena nahin
 It is believed that he made this statement only for the BSP
 lekin iske baad bhi jis andaaj main mayawati ne akhilesh kaa samarthan kiya he, usase saaf pataa chal rahaa ki 'buaa-bhattije' kii dosti gahari he
 This friendship can also be gauged from the fact that when Maiyavatiraja looked at Bhaiya, Akhilesh immediately deleted the tweet thanking Raja Bhaiya on Twitter
 iske baad unhone mayawati ko dhanyavad kehete hue doosraa twit kiya
 That means Akhilesh is also clear that for him, Mayawati has become more important in the changed equations than Raja Bhaiya
 darasal, rajyasabha chunaav se pehle akhilesh kii dinar party main raja bhaiya bhi pahunche the
 Raja Bhaiya had also spoken of supporting SP, after which Akhilesh Yadav tweeted that thank you for supporting Samajwadi Party
 magar ab anumaan lagaaya ja rahaa he ki rajyasabha chunaav ko lekar shuukravaar dinabhar kii raajnneetik ghatnakramon ke chalate akhilesh yadav ko twit hataane par vichaar karnaa padaa hoga, kyonki matdaan ke baad raja bhaiya ne kaha tha, na main badla hum, na meri rajnatik vichaardhaara badali he
 'I am with Akhilesh ji' does not mean that i am with BSP
 basapa pramukh mayawati se raja bhaiya kii duuri jagajaahir he
 The character of the BJP has been exposed in the UP Rajya Sabha elections, which always misuses power-institutions and money against the poor
 ek dalit ke chune jane ke viruddh bhaajapa ke saazish rachane se agle chunaavon ke liye bhi sapa-basapa kii ekta or bhi majboot hui he, iske liye sushri mayawati ji ko dhanyavad!pic

 purv pradhanmantrirajiv gandhihatyakand maamle main doshi tehraae gaye e ji perarivalan kii dayaa yachika parasupreme courtne guruuvar kotamilnaduke rajyapal se vichaar karne ko kaha he
 a bench of Justices Ranjan Gogoi, Justice Naveen Sinha and Justice m Joseph disposed of the Center's plea seeking a resolution regarding the release of the accused
 yah yachika tamilnadu sarkaar dwaara daayar kii gai thi
 The Center had told the Supreme Court on August 10 that it did not agree to the proposal to acquit seven convicts in the Rajiv Gandhi murder case
 centre ne kaha tha ki unki sajaa main katautee se khatarnaak nazeer pesh hogi or iskaa antarrashtriya asar hoga
 On the other hand, on 20 August, on behalf of Perarivalan alias Arivu, it was told that no decision has been taken even after more than two years on the mercy petition filed by the Governor of Tamil Nadu
 bataa den ki perarivalan par nau volt kii bydaree kii aapurti kaa aarope tha jiskaa istemaal kathith taur par us belt bam ko banane ke liye kiya gaya tha jisase purv pradhanmantri rajeev gandhi or 14 anya kii hatya hui

 pehle savarna aarakshan or ab essi / asti / obisi ke liye 200 point kaa roster system
 It is clear that the present government does not want to keep any section of society separate from its exercises before the future general elections
 vipaksh kaa shuru se aarope rahaa he ki centre kii modi sarkaar dalit, adivasee, vanchit, shoshit or kamjor tabake kaa dhyaan kam rakhti he or agadi jati par uskaa pyaar zyada paravaan chadhataa he
 However, the government has been troubled by this and has taken some steps to show that it is as much concerned about the weaker sections as the forward castes
 isi kram main sanshodhit dalit kanoon or savarnon ke liye 10 pratishat cote kaa praavdhaan kiya gaya
 Know what is the roster system
 The 13 point roster system is directly related to the restoration and reservation of faculty members in the college and university
 yah aisa roster system he jisamen college yaa uniwarsity kaa harek chauthaa teacher obisi, saatvaan teacher essi or har chaudaavaan teacher asti category main niyukt hota he
 Under this, each department of a college or university is considered a unit
 department ko ek unit maanate hue teacher kii bhartee main aarakshan dene kii suvidha he
 Until now, it used to be that reservation was given considering the entire university as a single unit
 2017 main elahabaad hoicourt ne ek faisle main aadesh diya ki essi / asti yaa obisi ke faikalti members kii naukari main aarakshan ke liye uniwarsity yaa college ko akeli unit nahin maanakar prayek vibhaag ko unit mana jayega
 The case further went to the Supreme Court where the apex court upheld the Allahabad High Court verdict
 is faisle ke khilaaf chaatr or teacher sadakon par utar gaye or kaha ki isse essi / asti or obisi varg ko kaaphi ghaataa hoga or unke cote main kami aegi
 Considering the roster system and opposition from politicians and criticism of the decision, the opposition parties also got new weapons and put the government in the dock
 in partiyon kaa aarope rahaa ki sarkaar ko aise varg kii koi chintaa nahin tabhi supreme court main rivyuu pitishan nahin daali gai
 India closed on Tuesday on the same issue
 sarkaar ne is virodh ko avasar mana or supreme court ke faisle ko kinare karte hue puraane roster system ke liye aadesh jari kar diya
 According to experts, this step of the government was exactly the same as was taken in relation to the amendment of the Dalit law
 supreme court ne apane aadesh main kaha tha ki bina jaanch ke fori taur par giraftaar nahin hogi or iske liye esadm rank ke adhikari se ijaajat leni hogi
 The government also bypassed this order of the court and passed the amended law making the Dalit law more stringent
 thik vaise hi roster main aarakshan ke liye sarkaar ne guuruuvaar ko adhyadesh paarit kar die
 The government took this decision in the cabinet meeting
 mana ja rahaa he ki guuruuvaar ko hui cabinet baithak sarkaar ke is kaarykaal kii aakhri baithak thi
 In which such a big decision related to SC / ST and OBC was taken
 lambey dinon se thi mangessi / asti or obisi virgon kii sarkaar se maang rahi thi ki 13 point roster system ke kaaran college or uniwarsity main arakshit siten khaali rah jaati hai
 The government took note of this and implemented a 200 point roster system so that the backward castes get more jobs and vacant seats can be filled easily
 haalanki kuch jaankaar supreme court ke faisle se ittefaq rakhte hai or kehete hai ki court ne agar puri uniwarsity ko single unit maanakar aarakshan kaa praavdhaan rakhaa to isaki vajah yah thi ki kisi department main sirf arakshit candidet hi na bhar jaaen yaa kuch department anarakshit yaa general category se hi nahin bhare jaaen
 The court believed that all the recruitments should be balanced, not too much or less
 magar isse riktiyaan badhati gayi jiskaa virodh vyapak ho gaya
 The government's balancing act, when the government gave 10% reservation to the upper castes, only then did the demand that there should be something for the Dalits too which should have a historical effect because if the government can spend thousands of crores of rupees on the upper caste reservation then balance it For SC / ST OBC also makes sense to do something big
 iskaa nateeja he 200 point roster system
 While implementing the upper caste reservation, the government had clearly stated that this quota will be applicable from the academic session of 2019
 arthath sarkaar chaahati thi ki iskaa koi asar essi / asti yaa obisi ke admician yaa naukari par na dikhe
 The government has tried its best to balance upper caste reservation by implementing a roster system

 (is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he
 This is published directly from Syndicate Feed) (NDTV team has not edited this news
 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he) The large population of the country still lives in villages and 'mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Scheme' (MNREGA) is an important scheme to provide employment to the youth in rural areas
 pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa manaregaa ko lekar shuruaati bayaan kaaphi surkhiyon main rahaa tha
 In February 2015, PM Modi took the Congress on the MGNREGA in Parliament
 unhone kaha tha, 'meri raajnneetik sooyeeboojh kahati he ki manaregaa band mat karo
 i cannot make such a mistake, because MNREGA is a living memorial of your (congress's) failures
 main gaaje-baaje ke saath is smarak kaa dhol peethta rahoonga
 However, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said in March 2015 immediately after presenting the General Budget, "the government is committed to providing employment through MNREGA
 ' aise main modi sarkaar ke manaregaa ke saath dulaar-duraav kaa milajula rishta rahaa
 Let us know how committed the Modi government was to the scheme launched during the UPA-1 regime
 kya he manaregaa?manaregaa gramin ilaakon main saal main kam se kam 100 dinon kii rojgaar guarantee dene kaa kaarykram he
 It came into force in 200 districts of the country in 2006, while from 2008 it was implemented nationwide
 2014 main vishwa bank ne apni report main ise gramin vikaas kaa anupam udhaaharan qaraar diya tha
 This year the biggest budget was allocated Rs 55 thousand crore for MNREGA in the financial year 2018-19
 yah is yojana kaa ab tak kaa sabase zyada bajet he
 However, technically it is not so, as last year i
e
 in 2017-18, 48 thousand crores was allocated for this scheme and in January 2018 released additional 7 thousand crores
 is tarah is saal bhi manaregaa ko pichhali baar ke bajet ke baraabar hi anudaan mila he
 The MNREGA budget was the highest in both these years
 kya rahi pichley 3 saalon kii sthiti?2016-17 main do supplementary alokation ke baad manaregaa kaa fund badhkar 47,500 karod ho gaya tha
 34,699 crore budget was received for MNREGA in 2015-16 and promised additional 5 thousand
 haalanki, naregaa sangharsh morcha ke nikhil de or saamaajik kaaryakarta aruna roy ke mutabik baad main keval 2,000 karod hi relies kiye gaye
 Talking about the financial year 2014-15, 34,000 crores was kept for MNREGA, but later it was revised to 31,000 crores
 upie ke shasankaal main kitna bajet?isse thik pehle upie-2 ke samay main 2013-14 or 2012-13 main manaregaa ke liye 33-33 hajaar karod rupee aavantit kiye gaye
 40,100-40,100 crores allocated in 2011-12 and 2010-11
 2009-10 main 39,100 karod, 2008-09 main 30,000 karod rupee kaa bajet rakhaa gaya tha
 Earlier, in 2007-08 there was a provision of Rs 12,000 crore for 330 districts of the country and Rs 11,300 crore for 200 districts in 2006-07
 kya asal main badha he bajet?gramin vikaas mantralay ke aankadon ke aadhaar par taiyaar naregaa sangharsh morcha or swaraj abhiyaan kii sanyukt report kuch or tasviir pesh karti he
 Till the beginning of the financial year 2017-18, the workers had pending liability of Rs 11,646 crore
 isliye is saal 55,000 karod rupee aavanton ke baavjood shuruyaat hi ghate se hui he
 Similarly, in 2016-17, against the budget of Rs 47,500 crore, there was an outstanding liability of Rs 13,220 crore
 2015-16 main 34,699 karod rupee ke bajet ke saamne 12,218 karod rupee kii dendaree thi
 6,102 crore was outstanding as against Rs 31,000 crore in 2014-15
 is tarah manaregaa ke bajet main se hajaaron karod rupee pichley saal backlog khatm karne main hi kharch ho rahaa he
 How was MNREGA affected in this government? Modi government has been accused of MNREGA limiting the rights of gram sabhas in MNREGA to the Center
 anumaanit kaarydiwas par sweekrut kaarydiwas kaa paharaa baitha diya he
 This has affected the budget
 swaraj abhiyaan kii report ke mutabik, 2017-18 main 288 karod anumaanit kaarydiwas the, jabaki inamen se keval 215 karod hi sweekrut kaarydiwas hue
 That is, there was a decrease in 25 percent workdays
 2016-17 main bhi 315 anumaanit kaarydiwas the, lekin sweekrut kaarydiwas 220 hi hue
 Workdays were reduced by 30 percent
 samay se bhugtan nahin hona badi samasyiske alaava samay par bhugtan na hona bhi badi samasya he
 The government report claimed that 85% of MNREGA payments were made on time in the two initial quarters of the financial year 2017-18
 haalanki, sarkaar ke aankadon se hi bani do report main saamne aayaa ki is saal keval 32 fisadi bhugtan samay se hua
 Talking about 2016-17, the government figures talk about 42 percent payment on time, while the report made with these figures showed only 21 percent payment on time
 kya he sarkaar ke saamne chunauti?disambar 2017 main azim premaji uniwarsity ke rajendra narayanan or do swatantra shodhakartaaon ke shodh main saamne aayaa tha ki manaregaa kaa 80 fisadi bajet chaar maheenon main khap jaataa he or baaki maheenon ke liye 20 fisadi bajet hi bachataa he
 The condition of the drought-hit state is even more serious
 may 2016 main ek janhit yachika par sunwaayee ke dauraan supreme court ne centre sarkaar ko 12 sookhaa prabhavit rajyon ko turant manaregaa kaa fund dene kaa nirdesh diya tha
 In 2015 and 2016, many people migrated from the rural areas to the cities due to drought
 sarkaar ke saamne manaregaa se inhen rojgaar dene kii chunauti thi, jo kaarydiwason main kami aane se puri nahin ho saki
 Many reports have revealed that unemployment has increased from unscheduled labor from demonetisation to villages to cities
 idhar, 2017 main bhi aath rajyon ne khud ko suukhaagrast ghoshit kiya
 Demonetisation and drought have put pressure on the rural economy, which has not subsided yet

 vipaksh ke netaa kaa aarope he ki ek ke baad ek aad aadmi party ke 11 vidhayak jail ja chuke hai
 And this has not happened unnecessarily
 kejariwal apane vidhayakon ko bachaane main lagedilli police ne vidhayakon par maamle kii acchhee tarah se jaanch padtaal ke baad hi vidhayakon par maamla darj kiya he
 And his arrest when needed
 iske alaava vijendra gupta ne kaha ki apane vidhayakon kii cargujariyon par lagaam lagane ke bajaae, aam aadmi party or mukhyamantricagerivalaparaadhik maamalon main aaropee apane vidhayakon ko bachaane main jute hai
 Now the party leaders are threatening to go to the High Court to pressurize the police, whose moral right they do not have
 AAP kaa eemaandaaree kaa nakaab hataayegivijendra guptane kaha ki unki party ab aam aadmi party kaa eemaandaaree kaa nakaab hataane ke liye sadakon par aam logon ke bich to ja hi rahi he
 This is why Kejriwal and his team are nervous
 gauratlab he ki arvind kejariwal ne unke vidhayakon kii giraftaar ke liye piem narendra modi ko jimmedaari bataaya tha or twit kiya tha ki modi ji ke ishaare par dilli police unke vidhayakon ko jhuthe maamalon main fansaa rahi he
 Kejriwal drags pm's name in everything: Leader of Opposition has said that public has come to know that by dragging pm's name in everything, Kejriwal makes a false attempt to call himself a victim and this time his effort will not succeed
 saath hi vijendra gupta ne ek bayaan jari kar aam aadmi party ke dilli sanyojak dilip pandey par bhi mukadmaa darj karne kii maang kii he
 Who forced his own party worker to commit suicide

 @incinkrecordsa post shared byranveer Singh (@ranveersingh) onmar 29, 2019 at 6:41 am PDT bharat ke kaaryvahak captain rohit sharma ne kaha he ki australia daure se pehle shikhar dhawan kaa form main lautnaa kaaphi mahatvapurn tha
 Dhawan, who struggled during the entire ODI series against the West Indies, scored a 62-ball 92 in the third and final T20 match on Sunday, as India beat the visiting team by six wickets to take a 3–0 clean sweep
 dhawan or yuva rishabh pant (25 gend main 53 ran) ne tisare wicket ke liye 80 gend main 130 ran jode, jisase bharat 182 ran ke lakshya ko hasil karne main safal rahaa
 Rohit said after the match, 'it was important for the team's attitude and the players to score before the tour of Australia
 shikhar visheshkar vanade siries main acchhee ballebaaji kar rahaa tha, lekin vah bade score nahin bana paa rahaa tha
 i am happy that he was able to play match-winning innings and get form before the crucial tour
 ’unhone kaha, ‘rishabh bhi krij par utarkar ran banane kaa bhookha he
 This was a great opportunity for him
 hamane pehle chah over ke bheetar do wicket ganvaa die the
 There was also some pressure
 ve isse acchhee tarah nipate or yah match jitaane vaali saajhedaari thi
 From the team's perspective, it is important that these two players scored
 ’siddhu bole- sadiyon main ek baar paidaa hota he kohli jaisaa khiladibharat ke australia daure kii shuruyaat bristben main 21 november ko teen maichon kii tii-20 siries ke saath hogi
 Rohit said the upcoming tour of Australia would be completely different and India should take confidence from a 3–0 win
 unhone kaha, ‘vahaan jaakar pradarshan karnaa hameshaa se chunauteepurn hota he
 Whenever you go there that is your test as a player, person and team
 australia main khel alag tarah kaa hoga
 Rohit said that in the current series, India did a lot of good things from the perspective of preparation, including fielding
 australia daure ke liye bharat kii test team main rohit ko bhi jagah mili he, lekin simit overon ke is salaami ballebaaj ne kaha ki vah itnaa aage ke bare main nahin soch rahe
 Rohit said, 'I think there is a long time before this
 pehle test match se purv hamen tii-20 international or abhyaas match khilne hai
 i am not thinking about Test matches
 main aisa vyakti hum jo kaaphi aage ke bare main nahin sochataa
 i am just thinking about going back a few days break and then going to Australia and preparing for the T20 series
 ’rohit ne team ke nae khilaadi krunal pandya kii tareef kii or kaha ki uski tarah ke nidar cricketer se bharat ko phayda hoga
 On the absence of legendary wicketkeeper Mahendra Singh Dhoni during the T20 series, Rohit said, "dhoni did not even play in the Nidahas Trophy in Sri Lanka
 ’unhone kaha, ‘dhoni kaa team main nahin hona khalataa he
 His presence only increases the confidence of not only me but a lot of players, especially young players
 ’ Among the major milestones after the establishment of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, Guru Golwalkar is the second important name after the founder of the Sangh, Keshavrao Baliram Hedgewar
 headgavar ke sangh ko aakraamak or tezi se prasaarit karne kaa kaam golvarkar ne kiya
 After this, the second major expansion during the Ram Mandir movement was Madhukar Dattatreya i
e
 Social Engineering of Balasaheb Deoras
 is dauraan sangh agadi jatiyon se nikalakar pichhadon or daliton, adivaasiyon ko ek abhiyaan ke tahat khud se jodne kii ranneeti ke saath aage badha
 The union also benefited from this
 soshal ejineering ke isi mantra se aaj kii bhartiya janata party kii raajnneeti chalati nazar aati he
 The BJP is booming on the interest of Dalits and backward castes
 aise kai saamaajik-saanskrithik kaarykram deshbhar main chalaae ja rahe hai jinase daliton or adivaasiyon ko yah bataaya ja sake ki wo hindu hai or is tarah wehindutvake vishad vistaar kaa hissaa ban saken
 In the 21st century, the biggest challenge facing the Sangh now is to make itself accessible in the increasing spread of modernity and technology
 sangh apni sthapana kii shatabdi ke antim dashak main chal rahaa he
 The BJP has a majority government at the Center for the first time
 rajyon kaa rang bhi kesaria he
 This is one of the most suitable conditions for the Union moving towards its century
 lekin is upyuktata ke liye nirantarata nitant aavashyak he
 Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat's three days of address in Delhi are behind this effort of continuity, expansion of the Sangh, protection of the Sangh and communication
 ise dilli kii bhashaa main RSS 2
 The beginning of 0 can be called
 sangh pramukh ke bhaashan ke teen nihitharthsangh pramukh ne apane udbodhan main bandhutav kii baat kahi
 What is Hindutva without Muslims, who is Hindu with all, development without morality is meaningless, do not blind the West, keep your values in front, we respect the constitutional system of reservation, consider homosexuals as part of society, The constitution is made by everyone, not the protector of the cow with lynchings, and we all believe and believe it
 
 
 jaisi baaten unke sambodhan kaa kendriya tatv raheen
 It is surprising to most people that these things have become the language of the head of the organization whose affiliates are asked to send someone to Pakistan and sometimes in the name of religious symbols and beliefs of other castes and communities
 People are even killed
 mohan bhagwat khud bhi jis tarah kii baaten pehle kehete rahe hai, unka tazaa bhaashan kram usase itar dikhaai detaa he
 There are basically three reasons behind this
 soshal ejineering ke agepahala to yah kimohan bhagwatke ye teen bhaashan unke liye nahin hai jo pehle se sangh ko jaanate yaa samajhate hai yaa uskaa anusaran karte hai
 One part of the society thinks of Congress as a party with Muslim appeasement
 aise logon ko waapas rijhaane ke liecongress soft hindutvaka sahaara le rahi he
 Similarly, a population believes that the BJP and the Sangh are communal
 bhagwat kaa bhaashan unheen logon ke hriday parivartan kii ore sangh kaa prayaas he
 The Sangh is now going beyond the mathematics of castes and trying to create a modern, comfortable and free from fundamentalism image in all classes
 yah 21veen sadi ke bharat main, or tezi se shahari hote bharat main sangh ke prasar ke liye ahm kadam he
 Those who do not know the Sangh closely, the Sangh is now standing with a picture in front of them
 is tasviir main vividh rang dikhaae ja rahe hai, ugta hua suraj or hariyaali dikhaae ja rahe hai
 People from all classes are being shown
 samvidhan or tirangaa dikhaaya ja rahaa he
 However, this does not mean that those who already know and speak or understand the language of the Sangh will change their perception about the Sangh, society and country after this address
 desh main sangh se jude logon kii raajnneeti usee puraani dhara par chalati rahegi
 This new look, new attraction is for a new Indian who does not know the Sangh
 jaise khel ke sahare bachche shakha tak pahunchate hai, bhagwat ke bhaashan ke sahare log sangh tak pahunchenge
 Another implication of coming into the mainstream is the pursuit of scope in the mainstream for ourselves
 apane kathanak ko badalakar sangh aisi bhashaa bolta dikhnaa chaah rahaa he jo ek varg, jati yaa sampradaay kii bhashaa na lagakar desh kii bhashaa lage
 The Sangh and the BJP now feel that they have been well established in Indian politics
 abtak ek party ke varchasv or uske saamne ugte aae gathbandhanon kii satta vaali paristhiti khatm ho gai he or ab satta ke liye sangharsh do dhruviya ho gaya he
 The BJP has become the political superpower of India
 aane vaale dashakon main congress yaa baaki dalon kaa muqabla bhaajapa se rahegaa hi
 But during all this, the Sangh also has to adopt a national character
 aisa isliye zaruri he taaki wo keval hinduon kaa sanghathan bana na rah jaae
 Or at least not so much about it
 sangh sahitya, kala, itihaas, arthniti jaise kshetron main khud ko sthapit karne kii vyakulata liye hue he
 In the efforts of the last four years, it has not yet achieved the success in intellectual and arts field as it was expected
 sangh ke is nae parichay ke baad ab wo gunjaaish banane ke daravaaje sangh ne khol liye hai
 This will increase the ease of joining the Sangh or sharing the platform with people from other communities and sections
 isi sahajata se sangh kaa dakhal or vistaar tay hoga
 This is very important for the Sangh
 kyonki sangh kaa lakshya bhaajapa ke sattashin hone ke lakshya se bhi bada he
 With this liberal face, the Sangh will also be successful in meeting the lack of numbers in power and in finding new friends
 sangh ke kai mahatvapurn binduon par udaar dikhte vichaar uski raajnneetik sugrahyata ke liye bhi sakaaratmak sabit honge
 The sage of immunity is an interest and inherent and is the defense of the Sangh in the event of change of power
 agar 2019 main aam chunaav kaa parinaam bhaajapa or sangh kii apeksha ke anuroop nahin aata he to jaahir he ki sangh ke liye yah chintaa kaa vishay hoga
 The biggest concern is that the way the Sangh has established itself in institutions across the country since 2014, it can be reversed
 or doosraa yah ki rahul gandhi or vipaksh sangh ko lekar jis tarah kii bhashaa bolte rahe hai, uski tulana kattarpanthi or ativaadee sanghathan ke rup main karte rahe hai, usase sangh ke sidhe nishane par aane kii bhi gunjaaish he
 In such a situation, a liberal perception towards the Sangh among the common people will also make the Sangh immune
 bhagwat ke ye teen dinon ke sambodhan sangh ke bachaav ke shabd banenge
 The policies of the Union will be seen as the policies of a defeated political party rather than the policies of a radical organization
 sangh ke prati kathorta hone par log sangh kii udaartaa ke tark de sakane kii sthiti main honge
 In this way, while the Sangh is seeing new boundaries of its political and social spread with its new avatar, it is also seen in the acceptance of the mainstream, the face of a liberal organization and an option to save its political ground
 
 satta main abtak sabase zyaada labhanvit hota sangh khud ko raajnneeti kii ladaai se alag khadaa kar paa rahaa he or aage bhi ja paa rahaa he
 It is an image created under a huge political vision
 sangh ko ummid he ki yah chitra pehle se adhik mohak sabit hoga

 After all these events, the political picture of Maharashtra had changed completely on the morning of 23 November
 logon kaa jo shaq tha wo yakeen jaisaa hone laga tha

 He said that Ajit would be accompanied by 10 or 11 mlas who would return

 It was also emphasized that all the NCP mlas are with us

 Shiv Sena has linked Shirakat in the RSS program of former President Pranab Mukherjee with the 2019 elections
 shivasena kii maane to RSS ne apane kaarykram main pranab mukherjee ko bulaakar 2019 kaa ground taiyaar kar rahaa he
 Shiv Sena's reasoning behind this is that if the BJP does not get an absolute majority in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, then Pranab Mukherjee's name will be put forward for the PM candidate
 iske alaava shivasena se apane mukhpatr saamana ke jariye rashtriya swayamsevak sangh par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha he ki RSS ne kabhi bhi shivasena ke purv pramukh bal thakare ko apane manch par aamantrit nahin kiya
 While trying to appease Muslims by organizing iftar party
 shivasena ke mukhpatr saamana ke sampadakeey main likhaa gaya he ki congress netaa pranab mukherjee ko sangh ke kaarykram main bulaane ke peeche dilli main ranneeti taiyaar ho rahi he
 The BJP is setting the agenda keeping the 2019 elections in mind
 shivasena kii maane to 2019 chunaav ke baad agar bijepi ko purna bahumat nahin mila to phir ye daanv kaam aa jayega
 Because if the allies are not ready in the name of Modi in the event of a hung Lok Sabha, then the name of Pranab Mukherjee will be carried forward, and it can be acceptable to all
 gauratlab he ki naaraaz shivasena ko manaane ke prayaas ke tahat bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne pichley hafte uddhav thakare se mulaakaat kii thi

 Australian cricket team captain Michael Clarke, who won the World Cup title for the fifth time on Sunday, said that during ODI powerplay, five fielders should be allowed outside the 30 yards range instead of four
 maujuuda niyamon ke mutabik powerple ke dauraan sirf chaar khilaadiyon ko 30 gaj ke daayre ke baahar khadaa karne kii anumati he, jisase ballebaajon ko bada shot khilne main aasaani hoti he
 Indian team captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni had also said on Thursday that the current ODI rules are leaning more in favor of batsmen
 ab clark ke dhoni ke samarthan main aane se cricket vishleshkon kii us maang ko bal mil gaya he, jo lambey samay se ekadivasiy cricket ke niyamon main badlaav kii maang kar rahe hai
 Clarke said after winning the fifth World Cup title by defeating New Zealand by seven wickets in the final of the ICC World Cup 2015 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) on Sunday
 Would like to have five fielders
 mere khyal se isse gendbaajon ko adhik avasar milegaa
 And this will also allow spin bowlers to contribute more in the match
 'clark ne kaha, 'baat sirf itani he ki is world cap main jitne adhik ran bane utane adhik nahin banenge
 But i would like to keep more fielders out of the limited range, especially at a time when wickets are more favorable for batsmen
 '- input IANS Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath's 'mega Ayodhya Show' on Wednesday has proved that the city of Lord Ram is the first on the BJP government's agenda
 ‘mega ayodhya sho’ main sarayu pujan, mahaarati, 1
 Will create a world record of 71 lakh diyas
 lekin is sabake bich ayodhya main ram mandir nirmaan kii baat dab naa jaae, party ke bheetar se hi ye koshishen bhi shuru ho chuki hai
 Rajya Sabha MP Vinay Katiyar and Uttar Pradesh Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya have strongly advocated the construction of Ram temple
 sawaal bada yahi he ki thik ‘mega ayodhya sho’ vaale din ko hi ram mandir nirmaan kaa mudda kyon chhedaa gaya? ram mandir ko aasthaa kaa sawaal bataane kii dhun kyon jor se bajane lagi?kabhi ram mandirandolan main bad chadhakaraage rah chuke vinay katiyaar beete kai dinon se ayodhya main hi deraa daale hue hai
 According to Katiyar, the Ram temple is the first and living issue for him
 katiyaar kaa ye bhi kahana he ki jahaan tak court ke faisle kaa sawaal he to wo dodhari talwaar he lekin ram kii janmabhumi to yaheen he
 Nothing is more important to us than Ram Janmabhoomi
 ayodhya menvinay katiyaar ram mandir parbole to lakhanu main ye morcha dipti siem keshav prasad maury ne sambhala
 He said that now even Muslims want to see a solution to this issue, they also want Ram temple to be built there
 adaalat kaa faisla jab aayega tab aayega
 It is clear that on the pretext of Diwali in Ayodhya, there is a strong effort to bring the Ram temple back to the center of politics
 2019 main loksabhaa chunaav hone hai
 Till this general election, either the initiative to build the temple will have to be taken or the temple will have to be tried
 ‘mega sho’ ke jariye bijepi ye jataane main koi kasar nahin chhod rahi ki ayodhya uske agenda main kitna upar he
 However, the Ayodhya parties do not consider Wednesday's festival to be correct
 unke mutabik is tarah kii diwali yogi adityanath ko mandir nirmanka rasta saaf hone ke baad hi manaani chahie thi
 On the other hand, the people of Ayodhya seem happy with the mega show
 unhen lagata he ki ayodhya kii pahchaan faijabad jile se nahin balki khud ayodhya se hone ja rahi he
 Ayodhya Municipal Corporation is formed for the first time and the first mayor is to be elected here
 haalanki ayodhya main ek varg aisa bhi he jo maanata he kyodhyaamein bhavy diwali manaane kaa kaarykram kahin na kahin ram mandir se focus hataane kii koshish he
 Purohit of Dingbar Akhara and Ramlala told 'aaj Tak' that the Yogi government wants to make this celebration of Diwali so grand that the issue of Ayodhya, i
e
 the Ram janmabhoomi-babri Masjid dispute, becomes smaller
 kyonki sarkaar par 2019 ke pehle ram mandir banane kaa dabaav he
 Therefore, it is an attempt to suppress the core issue
 udhar, yogi sarkaar kaa daawa he ki ayodhya main buudhvaar ko hone vaale aayojanon par sarkaar bahut zyada kharch nahin kar rahi
 The total expenditure of these events will not go above three crore
 haalanki sarkaar ye jataana bhi nahin bhul rahi ki 133 karod kii vikaas pariyojnaon se ayodhya paryaton ke maanchitr par aa jayega
 Congress President Sonia Gandhi termed Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi as 'power hungry' and said that due to this hunger, Modi is assuming himself as Prime Minister even before the election results are out
 congress adhyaksh ne ye baat balrampur or faijabad main chunavi raily ke dauraan kahi
 Sonia attacked Modi fiercely in an election rally organized in support of Congress candidate Vinay Kumar Pandey
 unhone kaha ki modi ‘satta ke bhukhe’ hai
 He understands that the election results have come in his favor
 congress adhyaksh ne kaha ki modi par satta kii laalasaa kaa khumaar aisa chadha he or vah satta ke itane bhukhe hai ki chunaav parinaam aane se pehle hi khud ko pradhanmantri maan baithe hai
 Describing the slogans against Modi's corruption as hollow, he said that there are many corrupt ministers in the Gujarat cabinet under Modi's rule
 sonia ne kaha ki puure desh main gum-ghumkar gujarat model ko bechaa ja rahaa he
 But in Gujarat, children up to 10 years of age are malnourished and farmers' land is being sold at a very low price
 unhone kendra kii congressnith sanyukt pragatisheel gathbandhan (upie) sarkaar kii uplabdhiyon kaa zikr karte hue kaha ki congress sabakaa vikaas karnaa chaah rahi he kyonki jab sabakaa vikaas hoga tabhi desh tarakkee karegaa
 The Congress President said that the people of BJP are trying to gain power through divisive politics, but the Congress never connected religion with politics for power

 From input language chetan bhagat kii bahupratikshit kitaab ‘half garlfrend’ market main aa chuki he
 This book can be rightly called 'much awaited' because perhaps everyone was waiting for this book to reach them when they could review it
 jis tarah se aajkal har koi ‘half garlfriend’ kii samiksha karne main laga he
 This seems to be the first book written for critics rather than readers
 chetan bhagat jaise lekhakon ko dekh or padhakar sahitya ko nae lekhak bhale milen na milen lekin nae-nae sameekshak thok ke bhav milane vaale hai
 Chetan Bhagat's previous books did not make much noise, but the problem started when Chetan Bhagat started writing the script of Salman Khan's film 'kick'
 salmaan khan ko jaanane waalon ke liye chetan bhagat jaise upanyaaskaar ke script riter banane se zyada hairaani kii baat ye thi ki salmaan kii film main script riter kaa kya kaam?itani ghanghor samikshaon ke baad bhi agar aapane ‘half garlfriend’ kharidkar, mangakar yaa udhaar lekar padhane kaa man bana liya ho to ham aapako chetanaa chahenge, is bare main nahin ki aap kitaab padhein yaa nahin balki is bare main ki aap kitaab main likhi hui baton ko kis had tak jivan main utaaren
 It is important to know girlfriends first
 garlfriend shabd kii utpatti do shabdon se milakar hui he
 From 'geral' in Hindi and 'friend' in English
 jyotishvigyaan ke jaankaron kii maane, to jab kundalee main rahu kii mahadasha chal rahi ho, saath hi shani, budh or buddhi donon par baari ho, mangal ulti disha main gum rahaa ho or guru kundalee ke aakhri khaane se bhi baahar nikalne vaala ho tab achche-bhale vyakti ke jivan main garlfriend kaa pravesh hota he
 There are many different things to hear from different people about their first meeting with girlfriends, but most people say that when they saw their girlfriend for the first time
 tab unki buddhi mamaa ke ghar garmi kii chuttee manaane chali gai thi
 Many thinkers have also said a lot on girlfriends
 kisi ne kaha, 'sukh or dukh agar jivan ke chakra hai to garlfriend chakravaat he
 So someone said, 'if life is a cycle of harmony, then the girlfriend is a cyclone
 'is kitaab kaa ek samvaad jo mukhya paatr apni garlfriend se kahata he
 Nowadays it is very popular, 'if you want to give, give it or else cut' ise to katai istemaal na karen
 Repeating such lines means deliberately resenting girlfriends
 isliye nahin kyonki isamen kuch ashleel yaa abhadra arth chupa he balki isliye ki aisa kahkar aap usase maang rahe hai
 Always keep in mind that only girlfriends have the monopoly to take any gift or anything
 ab aate hai ‘half garlfriend’ par
 Nothing happens in the world like 'half Girlfriend'
 garlfriend khush ho sakati he
 Can be sad kshubdh ho sakati he
 You may be enchanted or self-possessed
 ruthi ho sakati he yaa naaraaz ho sakati he par ‘half’ nahin ho sakati
 Annoyed girlfriends are found in abundance
 garlphend ke paas aisi divya shaktiyaan hoti hai ki ve din ke choubees main se atthaees ghante naaraaz rah sakati hai
 They don't even need any reason to be angry
 ek bhuktabhogi ne hamen jo jaankaree di, uske hisaab se ek baar uski garlfriend ne naaraaz hokar do din tak usase baat nahin kii or do din baad baat karne par phir naaraaz ho gai kyonki na to use yaad rahaa na ladkaa yah yaad rakh paaya tha ki do din pehle wo kis baat par naaraaz hui thi

 supreme court is aadesh ke baad jelon main band kaidiyon kii aprakritik maut, jelon main staff kii kami or jail staff ke uchit pareekshan par sunwaayee karegaa
 It is worth noting that before 13 June 2013, CJI RC Lahoti wrote a letter to the then Chief Justice, saying that the life of the prisoners in jail is going to be disturbing
 unhone jail main band 1382 kaidiyon ke saath amanviya bartaav kaa hawala diya tha or court ne is patr ko janhit yachika main tabdeel kar maamle kii sunwaayee shuru kii thi
 In this case the Supreme Court has issued interim guidelines- supreme court ne kaha he ki vichaaradhin kaidiyon ko lekar banaai gai cameti har teen maheene main meeting kare
 The secretary of the District Legal Cell Committee should join the committee and he should take steps to release the undertrials, prisoners who have completed their sentences

 iske baad uske gendbaajon kii jabardast dhunaai hui or rajasthan royles ne yah match 10 wicket se apane naam kiya
 On the other hand, the situation of Knight Riders, who secured a place in the IPL play-offs for the first time, looks better
 usne saat march ko chennai super kings ko haraane ke baad royal chalangers bangalore ke khilaaf apana 13waan match ganvaaya tha lekin pune warirs ke khilaaf jeet ke saath vah ek baar phir patari par laut ai
 This team of Gautam Gambhir has won eight of the 13 matches played so far
 uske khate main mumbai indiens ke baraabar 16 ank hai
 He has five losses in his account, similar to Mumbai Indians, but in terms of run rate, he is better than Sachin's team
 is lihaaj se nite rides kaa prayaas apane net ran rate ko barkaraar rakhte hue yah match jitkar talika main doosraa sthaan hasil karnaa hoga kyonki ravivaar ko agar super kings ke haathon royal chalangers kii haar hoti he to uske paas duusare kram par pahunchane kaa shandaar mauka he
 Even if the Super Kings team loses, the Knight Riders have a good chance of finishing second with 18 points but they will have to improve their net run rate further
 mumbai indiens ke paas bhi jeet ke saath duusare sthaan par pahunchane kaa mauka he lekin iske liye use nite rides ke khilaaf badi jeet darj kerani hogi
