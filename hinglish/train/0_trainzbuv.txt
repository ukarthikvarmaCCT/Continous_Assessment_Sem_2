 " The story collection 'afreen', touching the pain of human relationships, touched the mind

 alok achche gazalgo hai
 It is also famous in the same way
 isiilie unki kahaniyon kii bhashaa main kavy jaisi layaatmakataa he
 These stories are a bright mirror of emotion
 alok apni maa kii yaadon ko shiddat se jite hai
 That is why they are very close to the female mind
 unki kahani ‘salaakh’ kuddaar striyon ke astitv ko nakaarti purushon kii maansikta ko ujagar karti he
 So in 'falsafa', there is a vignette to keep the home's experience in difficult times
 jaat-paat se dur insaaniyat kii garmaahat ko alok koob mahasoos karaate hai
 The 'amma' story of the collection is very poignant
 ghar ke buzurg kis tarah apane tajurbe se jhine rishton ko ek sutara main piroe rahete hai
 At the same time, because of their absence, the heart aches when the relationship is torn apart, in a lion, - i have seen many millions of times in the house tearing, sneaking silently, knowing when Amma trumped
 kahani ‘afarin’ sochane ko vivash karti he
 Returns the pain of sleeping in relationships
 kahani kaa ek hi vaakya siharan paidaa kar detaa he - “upar vaale se kaho na ki wo agle janm main or aage ke saare janmon ke liye tumhen mere naam likh den
 What a pain it is
 ye pyaar kii kisi paraakaashtha he jo na jane kitnon ke dabe ghaav ko haraa kar detii he
 This is the victory of the storyteller that the reader finds himself alive in the character of the story
 prakhyat aalochak namvar singh ne ‘afarin’ kii bhoomika bade man se likhi he
 This is a proof that not only his contemporaries, but also his elder generation has a keen eye on Alok's writing
 rishton kii samaj, maanviya samvednaaon kii adbhut parakh or hriday main unka sampreshan nishchit rup se alok ko bahut khaas banaate hai
 Before the beginning of each story, cherish the essence of the story in its body, readers will love the art of light writing

 In the afternoon, three teenagers from Ghaziabad thought of having some fun
 unhone apane hi college main pard rahi 18 varshiya ek ladki kaa apharan kar liya or uske saath do ghante tak chalatikar main balaatkaarakarte rahe
 This Maruti Swift car was presented to 19-year-old Ankit Dagar on behalf of his family when he was young
 uske 18-18 varshiya donon chachere bhai-nitin dagar or mohit-bhi uske saath gaadi kii sawari karne ke liye aa gaye the
 This is not the only case
 police adhikariyon ke mutabik, motaa anumaan he ki mahanagaron main balaatkaar kaa har teesraa maamla car se judaa hota he
 The car is used either for kidnapping or as a rape site
 dilli police ke sanyukt police ayukta (trephic) satyendra garg kaa kahana he, ''maatr teen fisadi balaatkaari hi peedit ke parichit hote hai or jo ladkiyaan yaa mahilaayein apni marji se car main baithti hai unhen balaatkaar peedit nahin kaha ja saktaa
 "in Garg's argument, it has been previously assumed that most unknown persons commit rape in a moving car, but in most of the cases recorded, the rapist's victim turns out to be a neighbor, college mate or acquaintance
" dilli kii sadakon par vaahanon kii sankhya 19 lakh he, lihaaja chalati gaadi main balaatkaar ke sabase zyada maamle rashtriya rajdhani kshetra main darj hai
 Only 10 such cases have been registered in the first two months of the current year
 lekin police adhikari is baat kii pushti karte hai ki mumbai, surat, lakhanu, bhopal yaa bangaloru, desh ke sabhi bade shaharon main is tarah kii ghatnaayen ho rahi hai
 In Bangalore in December 2005, a taxi driver made a call center worker a victim of rape
 kaale shishe lage hone or kanaphadu sangeet bajte rahane kii vajah se surakshit ho gaye yuvaaon ke liye to kaaren aparaadh kaa mukt kshetra ban gai hai
 There is no complete ban on black vials in the country, which complicates the implementation of the law
 saamne or peeche ke shishon main 70 fisadi paardarshita or bagal ke shishon main 50 fisadi paardarshita rakhane kii chhot di jaati he
 Thankfully, the Delhi Police now has tools that can measure the transparency of black vials
 garg bataate hai, ''shahar main kai sadakon par ham kai baar isaki achaanak jaanch karte hai
 Due to this, more than 90,000 invoices have been made in the last 45 days
 ''dilli main aparaadh manovisheshgy rajat mitra kehete hai, ''bahut kam peedit car balaatkaar ke maamle darj karaati hai
 "one reason for this is shame, moreover, they are not comfortable about this heinous crime
" kuch peedit to is bare main apane parivaar ko bhi nahin bataatin
 Take 27-year-old fashion designer Sharmila (name changed), who was raped by her fellow designer who gave her a lift while returning from a late night party
 uskaa kahana he, ''maine iske bare main apane mata pita ko na bataane kaa faisla isliye kiya kyonki pataa nahin ve is ghatana ko kaise lete
 The direct result of this could have come at the end of my career
 mujhe maaloom tha ki mere saath kya ho rahaa he
 But i could not save myself
 '' ve is ghatana ke chah maheene baad bhi iske sadame se ubarne ke liye kisi visheshgy kii madad le rahi hai
 Experts say that rape in a moving car drenches the person committing such a crime, which increases as the speed of the car increases
 shahari evam yon adhyayan kii visheshgy or janimani samaajavigyaani patricia uberai kahati hai, ''chalati car na to saarvajanik sthal he or na hi nijee sthaan
 This is the kind of psychological threshold where people can, for a moment, abandon their dual mentality and do things that they would never do in public
 ''car balaatkaar sahyog se kiya jane vaala aparaadh he; isamen ek netaa hota he jo sabase zyada hinsak, galigalouj karne vaala or peedit par sabase pehle hamalaa karata he
 There is no place for rapists, but in fact, an expert psychologist, "the car strengthens its sense of control and privacy, increasing its confidence and security
" ''ise surakshit aparaadh mana jaataa he
 Such criminals feel that they will not be punished
 unamem se kam se kam ek koi pehali baar aisa aparaadh nahin kar rahaa hota
 Last year, three youths in Surat, including two from a family of police officers, forced a 17-year-old girl and her male friend into a car
 ladke ko car ke bheetar baandh diya gaya jabaki ladki ke saath chalati car main kai baar balaatkaar kiya gaya
 The attackers also made a video of the act and threatened that if the girl told anyone about the incident, they would make it public
 britain ke manovigyaani jon uri ne apane prasiddh shodhpatr inhebiting da car main kaha he ki car ''kaanch or dhaatu kaa ek nijee kavach hoti he jahaan prabal bhavanaaen saamaajik rup se asweekaarya tareeke se vyakt hoti hai

 The state government, which usually remains in the discussion about its popular schemes, has been subjected to severe criticism from some groups, including the opposition, for some time due to their own decisions
 lekin phir bhi uske hausale post nahin hai kyonki zyaadaatar vivaadon kaa ant yaa to uske manamafik ho rahaa he yaa parinaam uske paksh main aa rahaa he
 This means that ultimately the government is overshadowing the opponents
 8 farvari 2012: tasveeron main india tudedrasal pichley saal mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ne indore main yojit ek kaarykram main ghoshnaa kii thi ki july 2012 se skulon main pehali se 10veen class tak gita paath padhaayaa jayega
 Against this decision, the Catholic Bishop Council had dragged the government to the High Court
 coucil ke pravaktaa anand mutungal ne maang kii thi ki gita ke saath duusare dharm ke granth bhi padhaaye jane chahie
 However, the decision on the petition on 27 January is in favor of the government
 apane faisle main jabalpur hycourt ne kaha he ki gita dharmik kitaab nahin he balki jindagi jeene kaa tarika he
 Mutungal, who is thinking of taking this fight to the Supreme Court, says that his side was not heard properly
 ve kehete hai, ‘ham gita ke khilaaf nahin hai balki yah chaahate hai ki duusare dharmon ke granthon kii acchhee baton ko bhi shiksha main shaamil kiya jaae
 Leader of Opposition Ajay Singh, while voicing his opposition to the decision, says that saffronisation of education will not be tolerated

 bhopal ke shahar kaa
 g Mushtaq Ali Nadvi had issued a fatwa against it, calling it un-islamic
 jabaki mufti sayed babar kaa kahana he ki musalamaanon ke liye surya ke aage jhukna haraam he
 It is wrong to take such a decision, all religions should be respected
 haalanki virodhon ke baavjood rajya ke 6,000 se zyada sarkari skulon or kuch nijee shaikshanik sansthaaon main surya namaskara kaa safal aayojan hua or khud chouhan bhi isamen shaamil hue

 is adhinium ke antargat gauvansh kii hatya karne waalon ko adhiktam 7 saal kii kaid or jurmaane kaa praavdhaan bhi he
 Some of the provisions of this Act are subject to controversy
 jaise ki jis vyakti par govansh vadh kaa aarope lagegaa, use khud hi apane aap ko begunaah sabit karnaa hoga
 There is fear among minority communities about this provision
 unka maananaa he ki is kanoon kaa unke khilaaf durupyog kiya ja saktaa hai
 Senior journalist Lajja Shankar Hardeniya says, "this is a law in which only the person against whom the charge is made will have the right to prove the charge wrong
" yadi vah khud ko nirdosh sabit nahin kar paata he to use saat saal tak sajaa bhugatni padegi
 According to this law, no person will be able to take the cow dynasty anywhere without permission
 govansh ko bechney yaa pashu meley main le jane ke liye bhi sakasham adhikari se isaki ijaajat leni padegi
 People are apprehensive that due to this rule, the common man will have to unnecessarily visit the government office

 Pakistan's conspiracy has been exposed again in Mumbai attack
 mumbai hamale ko non state actors kii karatuut bataane vaala pakistan is baar america ke ek saansad ke bayaan se fansata dikh rahaa he
 US MP Gary Ackerman has said that the Pakistan Army is going to pay a compensation of Rs 1
5 crore to the family members of Kasab, the only surviving terrorist caught in the Mumbai attack
 pakistan ek taraf aatankwaad se ladane kaa raag alaapta he or duusari taraf bharat ke dushmano ko aarthik madad de rahaa he
 This time Pakistan's dreadful gameplan has been revealed not by India but by the American MP
 mumbai main kasaab ke khilaaf cese chal rahaa he
 He has also confessed his crime and has also exposed the conspiracy of Pakistan
 haalanki ab tak kasaab kai baar apana bayaan badal chukaa he lekin uske khilaaf saboot behad thos hai
 This is the reason why Pakistan has been continuously denying that Kasab is a resident of there
 lekin, ab america saansad gairi ecreman ne sansanikhej khulaasa kiya he
 a disclosure that will be difficult for Pakistan to answer
 house of ripregentative main dakshin asia maamalon kii up samiti ke adhyaksh gairi ecreman ne america congress ko bataaya ki is par andeh karne kaa koi sawaal hi nahin uthta ki pakistani fouj mumbai par hamalaa karne vaale aatankiyon ke gharavaalon ko muaavja dene ja rahi he
 Ackerman's statement in itself is very sensational
 sutron ke mutabik pakistani fouj ne 26 / 11 ke ekmaatr jinda aatanki kasaab ke gharavaalon ko dedh karod rupee kaa muaavja diya he
 Not only this, his family is also being given huge amount every month
 jaahir he america saansad ke bayaan ko yun hi khaarij nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Since Pakistan is an important partner of America in the war against terrorism after 9 / 11, if any responsible American MP is pointing fingers at Pakistan's commitment, then there is some truth in it
 yun to pakistan kii niyat or 26 / 11 main seemapar kii sanliptata par bharat lagaataar ungali uthaata rahaa he, lekin ecreman ke bayaan se yakeenan bharat ko duniya ke saamne paak ko benakaab karne main madad milegi
 Compensation of Pak army is not only going to be given to Kasab's family members but also to the families of the remaining 9 convicts of 26 / 11
 yakeenan ecreman kaa bayaan sansanikhej he or pakistan kii niyat par bade sawaal khadey karata he
 At least 173 people were officially killed in Mumbai Hamale
 pehle to pakistan is hamale main apana haath hone se inkaar karata rahaa
 But after the attack, when the talks of the terrorists who attacked Mumbai with the bosses in Pakistan were revealed, in this dreaded conspiracy, the names of some people of Pakistani intelligence agency ISI and Pak army were revealed
 lekin, phir bhi pakistan apana daaman bachaata rahaa
 Despite handing over a bundle of evidence, Pakistan continues to call itself Pakistan
 lekin ab kya safai degaa pakistan
 Now the American MP has raised questions on the intention of Pakistan
 house of ripregentative main dakshin asia maamalon kii up samiti ke adhyaksh gairi ecreman ne sansad ko bataaya ki mumbai par hamalaa karne vaale aatankwaadiyon ke pariwaron ko pakistan muawza de rahaa he
 The Pak army first gave Rs 1
5 crore to the kin of the ten terrorists and after that money is also being given to them every month
 ecreman ne ye sansanikhej aarope lashkare taiyaba ke bare main apni report pesh karte hue lagaaya

 Chauhan, who has been appointed to this post, has joined the list of disputed people in which Pahlaj Nihalani, Chairman of Central Film Censor Board (CBFC), who has achieved the feat of producing the song 'har Har Modi Ghar Ghar Modi' and Narendra Modi in Gujarat Mukesh 'shaktimaan' Khanna, who has campaigned for Asaram Bapu, is now the president of the Children's Film Society
 in sab kaa is tarah ke bade padon par kabiz hona bijepi ke shashan main soochna or prasaaran mantralay ke nikaayon ke bhagavakaran ke sanket detaa he
 On the other hand, Gajendra Singh Chauhan dismisses such allegations outright and says that the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting has given him this post only after 'thorough investigation' and process
 vivaad se kshubdh chouhan kehete hai, ''main is baat se pareshaan hum ki logon ne meri kshamtaaon ko jane or unhen kisi kasuti par kase bina hi meraa virodh karnaa shuru kar diya
 Referring to Chauhan's 'academic inexperience', FTII students have said in a letter to the ministry that the former actor and BJP member "does not have the necessary eligibility to lead and run this institute of international repute
" ''institute main pichley 11 saal se padhaa rahe or is samay screenple lekhan vibhaag ke mukhiya anjum rajathali kehete hai ki chouhan to sirf ghaas main aag lagane vaali chinagaari the
 The long-standing problems of the institute extend far beyond Chauhan's and three other members — Angha Ghaiyas, Narendra Pathak and Rahul Solapurkar's appointment to the institute's apex body, the FTII Society
 pathak aresas kii chaatr shakha akhil bhartiya vidhyaarthee parishad (abivipi) kii maharashtra ikai ke purv adhyaksh hai
 In August 2013, members of ABVP clashed with FTII students after Anand Patwardhan's documentary Jai Bhim Comrade's performance at the National Film Archive of India in Pune and the concert of Kabir Kala Manch
 urs kehete hai, ''pathak us samay rajya main abivipi ke mukhiya the or haal main unhone kaha tha ki hamen sabak sikhaanaa chahie
 Obviously, we do not want such a member in the society
 ''janvari, 2011 main said mirza or kundan shah jaise prakhyat filmkaaron samet visheshgyon ke samooh ne apatiai main nai jaan foonkane ke liye apni antarim report main kai siforishein kii thim
 It said, "the main point of our interaction with faculty, students and staff was to find faults and to blame
" '' vivaad kaa ek mukhya bindu yah he ki chaatro par aksar unki teen saal kii avadhi se zyada institute main rukne kaa aarope lagaaya jaataa rahaa he
 The interim report said, "this extended period of bending has become a permanent element of life on campus
 '' 2008 ke batch ke lagbhag 15 chaatr ab bhi tike hue hai
 This increases congestion in hostels and also increases the pressure on facilities such as cameras, recording rooms and studios
 urs kehete hai, ''aisa bhi samay tha jab do batch do camaron par kaam kar rahe the
 The students had to wait for hours for the color correction machine to cool down after use

 Says Narayan, "we have creative and highly thoughtful people on campus, who have different perspectives on different issues
" lekin hadtaal to puri tarah avaanchhneeya he kyonki usase academik kaarykram chaupat ho jaataa he or maahaul kharaab ho jaataa he
 "students say that the curriculum is so large that most students are unable to complete their final assignment in three years
" pravesh ke badale niyamon se chaatro kii sankhya bhi bad gai he
 This has also increased the additional pressure on available resources
 2010 ke baad se institute main har course main chaatro kii sankhya 16 ho gai he jo pehle 10 thi
 Rizu Das, 31, an alumnus, says, "the new curriculum includes projects, workshops and activities — everyone is compromised because they want students to complete their course in three years
" '' sirf chaatro kii hi nahin balki, faikalti kii bhi mushkilen bad rahi hai
 "the faculty gets very little money," says Rajbali
 unamem se zyaadaatar contract par hai, jinke liye naukari kii koi suraksha nahin or na hi aage badaae ke liye koi protsaahan yaa madad hi he
 "one student said," We have to depend on the workshops of visiting experts as there is a shortage of talented people in the permanent staff
 ''apatiai chaatr sangh ke sadsy naveenatam upkaran kharide jane main prakriyaagat deree kaa bhi zikr karte hai

 i can say this with a guarantee that the government is spending much less money on the film institute than what the film industry is paying for it
 ''chopra kehete hai ki filmein munaafe se kahin aage kii baat hai
 Cinema has the power to 'change the ideology of the country' and 'compel the audience to think'

 Shri Ram Raghavan, an alumnus and filmmaker here, dismissed the possibility of revisiting the Gitakrishnan Committee report of 2001, in which, in the case of the privatization of colleges run by government resources and the FTI, it was called the film industry

 raghavan kehete hai, ''film industry sirf 'bollywood' nahin he
 Students from all over the country come here to learn cinema

 "A concrete signpost under the campus's most popular base — the giant banyan tree called the 'wisdom Tree' — is keeping track of the number of days of the strike
" chaatro ko ehsaas ho rahaa he ki unki ladaai lambii chalane vaali he or ve uske liye jame hai
 Yashsvi Mishra, 28, a member of the students' association, says, "while we respect the individual political ideology of every person, these people have the ability to instill filmmaking skills in the students as well as the nationalist sentiments" Has said unki rajnatik patibaddhtaayen khulkar saamne aa rahi hai

 In this press conference, PM answered the questions of journalists on various issues including Narendra Modi, Pakistan, PM candidate

 Sanjay Raut, Shiv Sena spokesperson, has spoken of slaughtering mangoes on the routes of Ahmedabad
 agar modi piem bane to desh barbaad hoga, to aapke kaarykaal main desh koun sa aabaaz hua he
 Talking about the murder, what happened in Muzaffar Nagar during your tenure
 indira gandhi kii hatya ke baad dilli ke raaston main kya hua
 You have not answered yet about Ush
 ummid badi thi, logon ko piem kii press confren se
 But the mountain dug out
 ye time paas press conference thi, kuch haath nahin aayaa he
 PM has neither work in government nor Congress, so this work has been done to entertain the country
 seetaram yechuri kya bolecongress phir se sarkaar banane kii haisiyat main nahin he
 That is why we have made a political call so that alternative policy instead of current economic policy comes out
 bijepi or congress ke alaava ek tisare morcha kaa mauka bane
 The government did not have two power centers, it was always in the Gandhi family
 piem or adhyaksh praayah alag alag hi rahe
 Sharad Yadav, JDU In a way, nothing happens by his speaking, people do not feel
 jab log mahasoos karte hai
 People recognize intentions isliye jo haalat manmohan ke kaarykaal main hui he, desh bahut peeche gaya he
 The politics that is happening today will also take the country back
 aarthik vishmata or saamaajik vishmata donon ko milakar nahin chalegaa, kaam nahan kar paaegaa
 He did not get any opinion on this
 garib tabake par kuch nahin bol paae vah
 The lives of the poor cannot be changed in Delhi by making some announcements

 rajnath singh, adhyaksh, bijepimen unase kahana chahta hum ki jis narendra modi ne apane shasankaal main gujarat state ko development ke maamle main ek model state ke rup main khadaa kar diya he
 For him to say that the country will be ruined by his becoming PM
 yah haasyaaspad bayaan he
 Which he said that the person who rioted during his reign should not be PM
 2002 main jo kuch hua durbhagyapurna hua, nahin hona chahie tha
 But when the SIT has given a clean chit
 uske baad bhi iljaam lagaana
 i condemn it
 unhone kaha ki sabhi kaa vikaas hua
 This is a misrepresentation
 human development index se lekar vikaas ke duusare daawey jhuthe hai
 Economic discrimination and inequality have increased rapidly
 unki sarkaar ke dauraan do satta centre rahe hai
 Good works could never be expected from this
 sarkaar ke paas nirnay lene kii aazaadee nahin thi
 In the history of independent India, no government has been accused of corruption as much as their government
 arvind kejariwal, mukhyamantri, dilliis desh ke logon ke liye yah mahatvapurn nahin he ki rahul, modi yaa manmohan main se koun pradhanmantri banate hai
 The people of this country are fed up with inflation
 silendar ke daam 220 rupee badha die
 Those things do not even matter
 saare din yahi baat hoti he ki ye pradhanmantri ban jaae, wo pradhanmantri ban jaae
 Whoever becomes Prime Minister, what difference does it make
 farrukh abdulla, neshnal conferencefarukh abdulla ne kaha, 'hamen afsos he ki pradhanmantri ne ritairement kaa elaan kar diya
 The PM has not taken this decision under any pressure, but wants to rest so he did
 rahul gandhi ke pita bhi desh ke pradhanmantri rahe or bahut acha kaam kiya
 Maturity comes with time and will also come in them
 narendra modi kaa desh kaa pradhanmantri bananaa sach main vinaashkari hoga
 BJP should have chosen a better PM candidate than Modi

 ab aap kisi bhi job ke liye intervyuu dete hai to kai baar selary kii vajah se aap join nahin kar pate hai
 The important reason for this is that in HR round you do not talk to the manager openly about salary
 agar aap echaar round main ye baat karenge to aapaki naukari main ijapha ho saktaa he
 
 
 Negotiate with salary - Sometimes you agree on the salary offered by HR for the first time, which gives you less salary
 saath hi kai baar aap ek baar ofer dekhne ke baad wo naukari se manaa kar dete hai, aise main naukari se manaa karne se pehle hameshaa naukari ko lekar khulkar baat karen
 Do this work before you start a startup, you will get success
 Talk about your work - Whenever you sit in the HR round, sit with complete preparation and keep your old records with you, so that your points can increase
 agar selary kam ofer kii jaati he, to sabase pehle apane kaam kii vailu bataaen or unhen ye ahsaas karwaane kii koshish karen ki aap isse zyada diserv karte hai
 Know the market - Before joining any company, do thorough research on the market and the company
 iske liye aapako pataa hona chahie ki aapke anubhav or yogyata par industry kitni selary ofer kar rahi he
 Whichever company you are going to work in, be fully aware of it
 naa bataaen nijee kaaran-jab bhi aap selary ko lekar echaar se baat karen to hameshaa apni kariyar se jude tathyon ke aadhaar par hi bahes karen
 Never make your personal reasons part of the debate to increase salary, no matter how much trouble you are having
 aisa karke aap apni positive image banaate hai
 Do this 5 work, tension-free environment will remain in the office
 Talk about your goal - When you are talking on salary, keep your confidence strong
 apni skills, jimmedaariyon, aapni market vailu or apane aage badhane ke plan ke bare main HR ke saath jarur baat karen
 Bargaining - In any interview, it is very important to be alert and talk where salary is very important
 unase baat karne ke kram main apni soch se 10 fisadi adhik selary kii baat karen
 If you want 30 per cent hike, then talk to them about 40-45 per cent salary hike

 Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee was angered at many programs after hearing the slogan of Jai Shri Ram
 yahaan tak ki unhone kafile ke dauraan narebaaji kar rahe bijepi kaaryakartaaon ko giraftaar karne kaa aadesh de diya tha
 The bjp's influence is steadily growing in the state
 isi kaa nateeja he ki party ne pashchim bengal main 18 siton par jeet darj kii he
 When Moli Ghatak was asked about the slogans by the councilors, he refrained from answering it
 unhone apane bachaav main kaha ki maine kuch nahin suna he or main aise kisi bhi cheez par coment nahin kar saktaa jise maine nahin suna
 What is the matter? Actually, a video was going viral on social media, in which West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee was seen flaming people saying 'jai Shri Ram'

 During this discussion, Union Home Minister Amit Shah made a big attack on the Congress and raised the question that if France removes all the Hindus from their country after the change of power tomorrow, where will they go? On the question of discrimination, Shah gave many countries For example, while targeting the Congress, Amit Shah said that if the Congress party wants to say that any Muslim of any country comes in the whole world, then it should be self Taken the car, because of being granted asylum to Hindus
 is prakaar se desh chalata he kya, kabhi nahin chal saktaa

 actress kangana ranut ne pichley dinon manikarnika: da queen of jhaansi ko saport naa karne ko lekar ranbir kapur or aalia bhatta ko aade haathon liya tha
 Now once again Kangana Ranaut has pulled both actors
 is baar kangana ne aalia-ranbir ko bevakoof tak kah daalaa
 In an interview to Mid Day, Kangana criticized ranbir-alia for being the young face of this generation
 kangana ranut ne kaha- ''unhen yuva kehane kii kya baat he

Kangana Ranaut had flashed on Ranbir Kapoor- "many people say that movie" He is from the industry, his house gets enough light and water, so he does not want to keep his political view

 "earlier, while targeting Alia Bhatt, Kangana said-" Alia sent me the trailer of Raji and asked to see the film

 But there was no response from anyone for my film

 If they do not have a voice of their own, then they exist only to be the puppets of Karan Johar

 Hopefully, they understand the true meaning of success and their responsibility

 Ravana does not have 10 heads in Valmiki Ramayana, but Tulsidas made 10 heads and 20 arms of Ravana which are wrong

 So we have installed the photo of Ravana here and will build grand temples here

 *** Controversy has arisen over the decision of the Union Council of Ministers to build the memorial of 'lok Nayak' Jai Prakash Narayan in Lala Ka Tola village in Bihar
 lokanayak ke parijan tathaa samarthakon ne baliya ke jepi nagar ko unka asli janmasthan bataate hue centre sarkaar ke nirnay ko bihar vidhansabha chunaav main laabh lene ke liye uthaaya gaya kadam qaraar diya he
 Anju Sinha, the niece of Jayprakash Narayan, the pioneer of the entire revolution, said that the Central Government's decision to declare Lala Ka Tola village in Bihar as the birthplace of Loknayak and build a national memorial there is absolutely wrong
 unhone kaha ki baliya ke jepi nagar, jo purv sitabadiara gaanv kaa hissaa tha, hi narayan kaa janmasthan he or ise duniya ne mana he
 In 2001, Loknayak's birth centenary celebrations were held in JP Nagar, which was attended by many big political personalities including then Vice President Krishnakant, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Deputy Prime Minister LK Advani
 anju ne kaha ki narayan ko 'bharat ratna' dene se pehle centre sarkaar ne unke janmasthan ko lekar chaanbin karai thi, jisamen jepi nagar ko hi unki janmasthali mana gaya tha
 The same is also recorded in Central Government records
 aise main bihar ke chhapra jile main sthit lala kaa tolaa gaanv ko narayan kaa janmasthan bataaya janaa bilkul anuchit he
 Anju Sinha said that it seems that the bjp's policy at the Center to take advantage in the Bihar Assembly elections endie sarkaar ne yah kadam uthaaya he
 The comments ullekhneey he ki gat 24 june ko pradhanmantri narendra modi kii adhyakshata main hui kendriya mantriparishad kii baithak main jaiprakash narayan kii janmasthali bihar ke chhapra sthit lala kaa tolaa gaanv main rashtriya smarak banaae jane ke samskruti mantralay ke prastaav ko manjuuri di gai he
 According to Jayaprakash Narayan's niece Anju, Lala's Tola is his ancestral village, but due to the plague in the village at the time of jp's birth, his mother moved to the part of the village of Sitabadiyara, now called JP Nagar
 jis sthaan par is vakt lokanayak jaiprakash narayan gaanv sthapit he, usee ke ek kamare main unka janm hua tha
 The family and supporters of Lok Nayak termed JP Nagar of Ballia as his real birthplace, calling the decision of the Central Government a step taken to benefit in the Bihar Assembly elections
 sampoorn kranti ke praneta rahe jaiprakash narayan kii bhatiji anju sinha ne kaha ki bihar ke lala kaa tolaa gaanv ko lokanayak kaa janmasthan ghoshit karke vahaan ek rashtriya smarak banavaane kaa centre sarkaar kaa faisla bilkul galat he
 He said that JP Nagar of Ballia, which was part of the erstwhile Sitabadiyara village, is the birthplace of Narayan and is considered by the world
 varsh 2001 main lokanayak ke janmashti samaaroh kaa aayojan jepi nagar main hi hua tha, jisamen tatkaaleen uparashtrapati krishnakanth, pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi, uppradhanmantri laalkrishna adwani samet anek badi raajnneetik hastiyon ne shirkat kii thi
 Anju said that before giving 'bharat Ratna' to Narayan, the central government had investigated his birthplace, in which JP Nagar was considered his birthplace
 centre sarkaar ke abhilekhon main bhi yahi darj he
 In such a situation, it is totally inappropriate to describe Lala Ka Tola village located in Chhapra district of Bihar as the birthplace of Narayan
 anju sinha ne kaha ki aisa lagata he ki bihar vidhansabha chunaav main phayda lene ke liye centre kii bijepi nit The NDA government has taken this step
 tippaniyan It is noteworthy that in the meeting of the Union Council of Ministers chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on June 24, the Ministry of Culture has approved the proposal for the construction of a national monument at Lala Ka Tola village in Chhapra, Bihar, the birthplace of Jayaprakash Narayan

 “every worker should understand well that the BJP has no agenda other than the NDA agenda
 hamen yah sunishchit karnaa he ki is saajha agenda se party nahin digegi
 "(part of the bjp's manifesto of the National Session of Chennai on December 27-29, 1999)" The ideology of nationalism is a fundamental principle of faith for the BJP
 aaj desh ke andar ek bahut chota samudaay jis prakaar kii vachaalata kaa pradarshan kar rahaa he, vah samvidhan kii mul bhaavana ke khilaaf he
 We fully support freedom of expression, but this freedom is limited to the boundaries of the Constitution
 is aazaadee ke naam par bharat kii barbaadi kii baat ko ham katai bardaasht nahin karenge
 "(an excerpt from the BJP National Executive resolution of 19-20 March 2016 in Delhi) Even though the gap between these two views of BJP is almost a decade and a half, but the commonality is that the BJP was ruling both times
 pehali baar satta main aane ke baad bijepi ne chennai ghoshnaptr ko sweekaar kiya to tatkaaleen grih mantri laalkrishna adwani ne do-took kaha tha ki yahi ghoshnaptr ab bijepi kii aage kii soch he
 Now the BJP government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi is also calling the same nationalism and developmental thinking its prime minister which was adopted during the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government
 isamen bijepi ke kor agenda ayodhya main ram mandir, anuchhed 370 or samaan naagarik samhita behad chaturaai ke saath kinare chhod die gaye the
 These issues have been considered an important part of the bjp's agenda of cultural nationalism which has been the basic foundation of the Sangh and the Jana Sangh
 vipaksh main rahete hue ye mudde bijepi ko priy hote hai, lekin satta main aane ke baad is par maun saadh leti he
 The new script from JNU, but now the BJP does not want to touch on these controversial issues directly, so when "anti-national" slogans were raised in JNU, the party swiftly took the issue in the name of nationalism
 bijepi kaaryakarini kii baithak ke baad party ke ek varisht netaa party ke is agenda ke bare main kehete hai, “jeenyu vivaad ke baad rashtrawaad banaam rashtravirodh kaa aisa maahaul ban gaya he ki muslim samaaj ne khud ko is vivaad se dur kar liya he
 Even Azam Khan, a senior minister of the Uttar Pradesh government, who spoke highly on the issue of Muslims, did not say anything on the JNU controversy
 ” party ke ek anya netaa kii daleel he, “hamaare saanskrithik rashtrawaad se jude muddon ko hameshaa sampradayikta ke rang main sarabor mana jaataa he, lekin jeenyu se niklaa mudda rashtrawaad kii shrenee main aata he, jis par sampradayikta failaane kaa koi aarope nahin lagaaya ja saktaa
 "taking lessons from the recent electoral experience, the party wants to advance itself on the agenda of soft Hindutva through nationalism
" khud shah modi sarkaar ke ek saal puraa hone ke maukey par kor agenda ko puraa na kar paane kii majaburi jataa chuke hai
 That is why Prime Minister Narendra Modi also said in the executive, "nationalism is our strength and we should move forward on that
 ” isliye jaise hi congress netaa shashi tharur ne jeenyu chaatrasangh ke adhyaksh kanhaiya kumaar kii tulana shahid bhagat singh se kii, bijepi ne apana purajor virodh jataate hue kaaryakartaaon ko 23 march ko bhagat singh kaa shahidi diwas manaane or agle din holi ke maukey par “meraa rang de basanti chola” gane ke saath desh bhar main holi manaane kaa nirdesh de diya
 Saroj Pandey, the only woman general secretary of the party to take charge of the executive, even raised the issue of nationalism, intolerance with Bharat Mata Ki Jai
 unhone to yahaan tak kah diya ki award vaapasi karne waalon kii aatma us din kahaan chali gai thi jab nirbhaya cond ke samay yuva sadakon par tha
 Nationalism with development: The strategy of BJP is to link ideology with the developmental policies of Modi government
 isliye party ne parampara se hatakar aarthik prastaav kii bajaae is baar kaaryakarini main gram udai se bharat udai kaa prastaav pesh kiya
 It details the efforts made in the general budget for poverty alleviation, the schemes launched for farmers, the goal of providing electricity to every village in the country, and the creation of employment in the villages in detail
 rajnatik prastaav main bhi garibi unmoolan ke prati sankalp ke saath adarsh gram yojana, smart city, pradhanmantri awaas yojana, jan dhan yojana, aadhaar number, pradhanmantri ujjwal yojana, manaregaa kaa navinikaran or vistaar jaisi yojanaon kaa zikr karte hue kaha gaya he, “sabhi yojanaayen aam jan kendrit or vikaas ke model par aadhaarit hai, jo hamaare ekatm maanavvaad ke siddhant se mail khaataa he or yahi bijepi kaa rajnatik darshan bhi he
 In the meeting, BJP President Amit Shah put more emphasis on the issue of nationalism, then Prime Minister Modi kept the focus on the achievements of the government
 modi ne kaha, “hamen ek hi mul mantra ko lekar aage chalanaa he&vikaas, vikaas or vikaas, yahi hamaari sari samasyaon kaa samaadhaan he
 "emphasis on social extension" The Shah policy of organization expansion was strongly praised at the working meeting
 modi ne kaha ki beetaa varsh sanghathan vistaar kaa rahaa, lekin ab jamini vistaar ke baad jarurat he kaaryakartaaon ko sakasham banane kii taaki ve rashtranirmaan main agrani bhoomika nibhaa saken
 Shah also appealed to make 11 crore party workers active members
 unhone baithak main bataaya ki kis tarah party ne 7
 Has trained 76 lakh workers
 shah ne kaha ki deshbhar main bijepi kaa padchinh dikhnaa chahie
 But he did not mention the mass campaign between membership and training
 party kaa yah abhiyaan buree tarah se naakaam ho chukaa he, isliye party ab is abhiyaan kaa zikr tak nahin karnaa chaahati
 But on the other hand, in order to increase the social base, he gave Dr

 There is no enthusiasm, according to the BJP constitution, there should be an executive meeting every three months, but this meeting was held after a year
 phir bhi sadasyon or party main isko lekar jaise koi utsaah hi na tha
 The ideological party vied for individualism
 sansadeey kaarymantri venkaiya naidu ne modi ko desh ke liye bhagwaan kaa vardaan kaha to sanghathan mahaamantri raamalaal ne rajnath singh or shah donon ke kaarykaal par sanghathanaatmak report rakhte hue modi-shah kii tarifon ke pul baandh die
 According to sources, Shah had to intervene to stop Naidu
 shah ne unase prastaav par bolne ko kaha
 One member explains, "there was only glorification in the meeting
 ” baithak ko lekar utsaah kaa andaja isse bhi lagaaya ja saktaa he ki ek din pehle jab mahasachivon kii baithak main prastaavon par charchaa honi thi to uskaa hindi anuwaad hi maujuud nahin tha, jisase charchaa nahin ho pai
 Disputes also arose between officials at the meeting venue
 media vibhaag aayojan sthal se media ko dur rakhana chaah rahaa tha, taaki nakaaratmak khabaron ko roka ja sake
 But Shah also made a direct intervention to make a separate arrangement for the media at the venue, although due to lack of proper arrangements there, the media had to be shifted to the party headquarters

 yah film darshakon ko ek bardrawneeor bhutiya duniya ke rahasyon sedratinjar aegi
 'paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension' will be released in 3D in October
 dekhen film 'pairanormal activity: da ghost diemension' kaa trailor: If you think that in the last few years, the number of children who have got 90 percent number in the board examinations has suddenly increased wildly and there is something wrong behind it, then your suspicion is absolutely correct
 ricardtod numberon ke peeche vaaki khel ho rahaa he
 But if the central government runs, this game could be over from next year
 numberon ko jod-tod se badhaane ke is khel ko spiking kehete hai
 Now the Ministry of Human Resource Development of the Central Government has started work towards ending this by forming a working group of eight boards of the country including CBSE
 chunki shiksha ek aisa vishay he jo samavarti suchi main aata he
 That is, it is seen by both the Central and State Governments, so the Central Government cannot take a unilateral decision on it
 iske liye rajyon ke saath sahmati bananaa jaruri he
 But there are a total of 41 boards across the country and it will not be easy to reach a consensus to stop the game of arbitrarily increasing the numbers
 pariksha kii kapi janchne ke baad kisi bhi bachche ko jo number asal main miltaa he use Raw Marks kehete hai yani wo asli mark jo us student ne hasil kiya
 But when the result is declared, this number is not disclosed
 rigelt ghoshit hone se pehle har board apane apane hisaab se numberon ko badhaata he taaki rigelt ko behatar dikhaaya ja sake
 Before declaring the result, all the boards increase the numbers due to several reasons, which is called moderation policy
 pehali vajah hoti he un students ko paas karana jo mahaj kuch number kam hone kii vajah se kisi vishay main fail ho rahe hai
 These are usually passed by giving some grace marks so that their whole year is not spoiled due to some number being low
 board kii ejamination cameti khud se tay karti he ki kis vishay main kitna gres marks rakhaa jaae
 There is no dispute about Grace Marks and this will continue
 gres marks ke alaava board ye dekhte hai ki kis vishay kii pariksha main sawaal kathin hone ke bare main, yaa sawaal spasht nahin hone ke bare main kitni shikaayat ai he
 Based on this, the board decides some numbers and adds them to the real number of each student
 lekin ye number unheen students ke marks main joda jaataa he jinke number 95 pratishat se kam hon
 Usually, CBSE prepares three sets of question papers for the same examination so that if a question paper is leaked at some place, the examination can be done from another question paper instead of canceling it
 kai or board bhi aisa hi karte hai
 While preparing the result, it is kept in mind that the students appearing for the exam from all the sets of questions will be on par with the number
 isliye jis set ke number kam hon use phir se badhaayaa jaataa he
 The concern of the central government is that in comparison to showing better results than each other, the boards are desperately trying to increase the number
 haal ye he ki admician ke vakt 90 fisadi number laane vaale students ko bhi manachaahe college main apane pasand kaa vishay paane main dikkat hone lagi he
 All colleges and universities have admissions based on marks instead of entrance exams
 isliye kai board apane students ko number dene me jarurat se zyada udaartaa dikhaa rahe hai
 According to the CBSE rules itself, while preparing the result, it is also to be noted that the result should not be worse than last year
 Moderation Policy ke is niyam kii vajah se bhi number dhadlle se badaye ja rahe hai
 CBSE wanted to abolish this rule from this year, but after the Delhi High Court order, it will be abolished from next year
 isi saal 24 april ko dilli main desh kesabhi board kii baithkahui thi jisamen is baat par mote taur par sahmati bani thi ki number badhaane ke khel par ankush lagane kii jarurat he
 Now CBSE will try to reach agreement with other boards for which a working group is being formed

 a few days ago, Azam wrote a letter to the Chief Minister to suspend Municipal Commissioner MP Singh, taking seriously the lack of cleanliness around the Chief Minister's residence, but no action has been taken on his letter yet
 ajam ko is baat kaa dukh he ki sarkaar adhikariyon ke khilaaf karrwai ke mudde par unka saath nahin de rahi he
 That is why, instead of writing a letter to the Chief Minister against senior officials this time, he left the departmental work, so that the government could be pressured into action
 ullekhneey he ki somvaar ko nagar vikaas vibhaag main baithak main do varisht adhikariyon ke na pahunchane se naaraaz ajam ne teen dinon tak chalane vaali baithak ko pehle hi din barkhaast kar diya tha
 Azam had said that he would not tolerate the negligence of senior officials

 aisa mana ja rahaa he ki ajam khan ne dabaav kii ranneeti akhriyaar karte hue aisa kadam uthaaya he
 By taking this step, Azam has tried to send a message that he is not happy with the attitude of the top people in the government on Lucknow Municipal Commissioner MP Singh
 kuch dinon pehle hi ajam ne mukhyamantri awaas ke aasapaas safai na hone ko gambheertha se lete hue nagar ayukta empi singh ko nilambit karne ke liye mukhyamantri ko patr likhaa tha lekin unke patr par abhi tak koi karrwai nahin kii gai he
 Azam is sad that the government is not supporting him on the issue of action against the officials
 isiilie is baar unhone varisht adhikariyon ke khilaaf mukhyamantri ko patr likhane ke bajaay vibhageeya kaamkaaj hi chhod diya, taaki sarkaar par karrwai kaa dabaav bana sake
 It is worth mentioning that on Monday, angry with the absence of two senior officials in the meeting in the Municipal Development Department, Azam had dismissed the three-day meeting on the first day
 ajam ne kaha tha ki vah varisht adhikariyon kii laaparvaahee bardaasht nahin karenge
 Soon after Azam sacked the meeting, Samajwadi Party (SP) spokesperson Rajendra Chaudhary had called a press conference and said that Azam Khan is the senior minister of the state and he must have taken a decision with some thought
 tippaniyan Chaudhary also advocated Azam saying that such negligence of officers would not be tolerated

 Demonetisation in the country has caused an outcry
 bihar kii rajdhani patna bhi isse achhuti nahin he
 For this, the Mahavir Mandir Trust has taken an important decision so that demonetisation does not affect the patients coming for treatment
 mandir trust kii ore se patna mahavir mandir se jude aspataalon main ilaaj ke liye aane vaale gambhir rup se peedit marijon ko mandir prabandhan kii ore se 5 hajaar rupye tak kii aarthik madad dene kaa nirnay liya gaya he
 Acharya Kishore Kunal, head of the Mahavir Temple Trust, said that this decision has been taken by the temple management keeping in mind the situation arising after the Kinotbandi
 acharya kishor kunal ne kaha ki notebandi ke baad utpann sthiti ko dhyaan main rakhte hue mahavir mandir nyaas samiti mahavir mandir kii ore se sanchalit sabhi aspataalon main ilaaj ke liye aane vaale gambhir rup se biimaar marijon ko paanch hajaar rupye kii aarthik madad karegi
 After this, the expenses of the patient will have to be borne by the patient's family
 kishor kunal ne kaha ki saare aspataalon main check se bhi paise liye jaaenge
 He said that swapping machines will also be installed in all hospitals soon so that patients do not have any kind of trouble
 iske baad credit card or debit card se bhi ilaaj ke kharch kii raashi ke bhugtan kii suvidha shuru ho jaaegi
 Kishore Kunal, head of the Mahavir Temple Management Committee, has requested the bank that if the bank wants to set up its stall in hospitals run by the Mahaviramandir management, it will be provided space by the temple management
 isse ilaaj ke liye aane vaale marijon ko bhi suvidha milegi
 There is no shortage of space in all the hospitals run by the temple
 mahavir mandir kii ore se sanchalit saare aspataalon main puraane note nahin liye jaaenge
 But there is no problem in the treatment, the temple management will start the initial treatment of up to five thousand rupees from its level for the seriously ill patients coming for treatment by the temple management
 yah paise marij se nahin liye jaaenge
 This decision has been taken by the temple management keeping in mind that no one is killed due to lack of treatment
 paanch hajaar ke atirikt kharch ko parijan iske baad cash yaa phir check se jamaa kar sakate hai
 The impact of note closure is being seen in hospitals as well
 sarkari aspataalon main topurane noteliye ja rahe hai, lekin privet aspataalon main yah suvidha naa rahane kii vajah se khaskar garib marijon ko bahut samasya ho rahi he
 Three hospitals run by the Mahavir temple in Patna
 mahavir cancer aspataal main pehle se hi 10 hajaar rupye tak kii madad kii jaati he
 The poor and children below 18 years of age are of any caste, they are given a help of Rs 15,000

 After the Election Commission's decision, Akhilesh Yadav has again come to meet Mulayam Singh Yadav
 mulaayam ke kareebi sutron ke mutabik mulaayam singh ab maan gaye hai or apane pratyaashee nahin utaarenge
 In return, Mulayam has given a list of 38 names of his supporters to Akhilesh Yadav
 usamen shivpal yadav kaa naam nahin he
 His son Aditya Yadav is named in his list
 iske alaava akhilesh yadav dwaara barkhaast kiye gaye chaaron mantriyon ke naam suchi main hai
 Faces such as Ambika Chaudhary, Om Prakash Singh, Narada Rai, Shadab Fatima are also included in this list
 in logon ko shivpal yadav kaa kareebi mana jaataa rahaa he
 In fact, since the Election Commission's decision in favor of the Akhilesh camp, Mulayam Singh had kept silent
 unke agle kadam par hi sabaki nigahen tiki hui thim
 Before the Commission's decision yesterday, Mulayam Singh reached the party headquarters and there he criticized Akhilesh Yadav
 mana ja rahaa tha ki yadi faisla mulaayam ke paksh main nahin aayega to vah lokdal ke chunaav nishaan par apane pratyaashiyon ko utaarenge
 This could have damaged Akhilesh's candidates
 isliye mana ja rahaa he ki mulaayam kaa maananaa behad jaruri he or unako manaane ke prayaas hi chal rahe hai
 In the sequel to the same, sources are saying that Mulayam Singh has now agreed and will not stand his candidates in front of Akhilesh's candidates
 haalanki is bich sapa ke congress ke saath gathbandhan kii tasviir bhi saaf hoti dikh rahi he
 On behalf of SP, Akhilesh Yadav and on behalf of Congress, Ghulam Nabi Azad have said that there will be an alliance between these parties in the next two days
 mulaayam singh is gathbandhan ke paksh main bhi nahin the
 The comments congress ke ranneetikaar prashanth kishor ne bhi is silsile main mulaayam se mulaakaat kii thi
 But in a press conference, Mulayam had ruled out the possibility that whoever wants to fight with SP will have to merge his party with SP
 lekin akhilesh yadav is gathbandhan ke pakshdhar the
 Now, if Mulayam does not take his candidate, then it would be considered a big success for Akhilesh too
 yani ki ek to congress ke saath gathbandhan hoga or duusare sapa main voton kaa bikharaav nahin hoga
 In fact, this alliance is expected to benefit in terms of maximum Muslim votes
 yani ki mulaayam ke ummidavaar nahin hone se sapa ke voton kaa bantwaaraa nahin hoga or uskaa paramparaagat yadav-muslim voter party ke saath judaa rahegaa

 However, the picture of the sp's alliance with the Congress is also clear
 sapa kii taraf se akhilesh yadav or congress kii taraf se gulam nabi aaazaad ne kaha he ki agle ek-do dinon main in dalon ke bich gathbandhan ho jayega
 Mulayam Singh was also not in favor of this alliance
 tippaniyan Congress strategist Prashant Kishore also met Mulayam in this regard
 lekin ek press conference main mulaayam ne yah kahkar is sambhaavna ko khaarij kar diya tha ki jo bhi sapa ke saath ladanaa chahta he, usko apni party kaa vilay sapa main karnaa hoga
 But Akhilesh Yadav was in favor of this alliance
 ab yadi mulaayam apane pratyaashee nahin utaarenge to is lihaaj se bhi akhilesh ke liye ise badi kamyaabi mana jayega
 That is, one will be aligned with the Congress and there will be no splitting of votes in the other SP
 darasal is surat main is gathbandhan ko sabase zyada muslim maton ke lihaaj se laabh hone kii ummid he
 That is, due to Mulayam's candidature, there will not be sp's votes and his traditional yadav-muslim voters will be associated with the party
 congress ke ranneetikaar prashanth kishor ne bhi is silsile main mulaayam se mulaakaat kii thi

 He was not at all uninterested like this
 donon ne vidhansabha main vipaksh kaa netaa banane ke liye jor lagaaya tha par donon ke haath kuch nahin aayaa
 Due to internal factionalism, the Congress had to attend the assembly session on the first day without any leader
 isi din shaam ko congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ne satyadev kataare ko madhya pradesh vidhansabha main vipaksh kaa netaa bana diya

 The exercise of consensus for the leader of the opposition in the party's office at 15 o'clock proved to be useless
 congress vidhayako kii baithak mahaj 30 minute main khatm ho gai
 After this, a second meeting started from 5 pm in which Fernandes and Joshi interacted with each MLA and filled the a • form with them which was also a ballot paper
 is maukey par party ke 58 vidhayakon main se 56 party offis pahunche the jabaki vidhayak manoj agarwal or kamalesh shah nahin aae
 Despite much difficulty, when the two central observers failed to reach a consensus, he spoke to Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi over the phone and walked out of the office with Mohan Prakash, the party's state affairs in-charge
 joshi or furnandis ne ek prastaav paarit kar vipaksh kaa netaa manonith karne kaa nirnay sonia gandhi par chhod diya
 Here, an MLA Narayan Tripathi was heard saying that when the high command was to choose the leader of the opposition, then what was the need to establish a Majma in Bhopal
 paryvekshakon ke jate hi kalookheda or ajay singh ke bich kahasuni shuru ho gai
 Kalukheda claimed that he was himself a contender for the post when Ajay Singh became the leader of the legislature party in lieu of Arjun Singh's death
 is par, ajay ne palatwaar karte hue kaha ki kalookheda ne maansik santulan kho diya he
 a large number of supporters of both groups started shouting slogans on the road in front of the party office
 sindhiya gut ne to ajay singh kii gaadi bhi rokane kii koshish kii
 If a close MLA from Kalukheda is to be believed, he had the support of 35 mlas, out of which 12 were Scindia faction, 16 Kamal Nath faction, 3 Pachauri faction and 4 MLA were close to former Union minister and MP Arun Yadav
 udhar, ajay singh ke ek kareebi vidhayak ne 37 vidhayakon ke samarthan kaa daawa kiya
 Even before reaching here, Ajay Singh had a meeting of mlas at his government bungalow
 jabaki kalookheda bhi kamalnath or suresh pachori gut ke logon sahit sindhiya gut ke 20 se zyada vidhayakon se sampark kar chuke the
 The Pachauri faction with young mlas, led by Sanjay Pathak, did not open its cards
 haalanki ab pachori or kamalnath gut sindhiya gut kaa samarthan kar rahe hai
 Two days after this spectacle of January 5, the Congress made Satyadev Katare the leader of the legislature party
 kataare shuru main daavedaar the par baad main peeche hat gaye the
 By the way, Bala Bachchan, who is close to Kamal Nath, was also eyeing the post of Leader of Opposition but at the behest of his mentor, he withdrew from the race
 ab kataare ke saamne digvijay gut ke vidhayakon ko saath lekar chalane kii chunauti he
 But it will be difficult for him to join the Digvijay faction to surround BJP
 jaahir he, vidhansabha chunaav main aapasi kalah kii vajah se mili haar se bhi party ne sabak nahin liya he
 In the 2008 assembly elections too, the Congress lost due to mutual rivalry between Digvijay and Pachauri factions
 us samay vipaksh ke netaa ajay singh or pachori gut ke up-netaa choudhary rakesh singh chaturvedi ke bich koi talmail nahin tha
 The bitterness between Ajay and Chaturvedi later increased enough that Chaturvedi joined the BJP just before the 2013 assembly elections
 der se hi sahi, vidhayak dal kaa netaa chun lene ke baad ab hikeman ko pradesh main nayaa party adhyaksh bhi chunanaa he, kyonki kantilal bhuriya ne party kii buree tarah hui haar kii jimmedaari lete hue pichley maah hi istipha de diya tha
 He has been asked to assume this responsibility until a new chairman is elected
 gutbaji ko dekhte hue kendriya netritv ke liye nayaa pradesh adhyaksh tay kar paanaa mushkil ho rahaa he
 Party sources say that the high command wanted to give this responsibility to Arun Yadav but the decision was stuck due to factionalism
 arun ke karibiyon kii maane to ve bhi aapasi jhagadon or party kii kamjor haalat ko dekhte hue yah jimmedaari nahin uthaanaa chaahate
 Political analysts say that internal factionalism is going to cost the party dearly in the Lok Sabha elections as well
 april, 2013 main do din kii pradesh yatra ke dauraan kaaryakartaaon ne rahul gandhi ko do-took kah diya tha ki gutbaji kaaphi bad gai he or agar ise khatm nahin kiya gaya to party lagaataar teesri baar vidhansabha chunaav haaregi
 The activists told Rahul that Digvijay, Kamal Nath, Pachauri and Scindia factions continue to fight for supremacy
 dilli lautne par rahul ne sabhi guton ko ek manch par laane or sindhiya ko rajya main party kii jimmedaari dene kii koshish shuru kar di thi
 Although the high command wanted to declare Scindia as the face of the party in the state in September 2012, but due to the opposition of Digvijay, in the first week of September 2013, Scindia was given the responsibility of campaigning head in the state
 iske baad chunaav tak digvijay, kamalnath, sindhiya or pachori ne khub haath milaae or ek manch se chunaav sabhaaon ko sambodhit kiya
 But it was all pretense
 vidhansabha chunaav ke liye tikat baantate samay bade netaaon ne apane samarthakon kii vakaalat kerani shuru kar di
 The bitterness was so high that when Kamal Nath and Scindia went to a meeting convened in Delhi to decide the candidates, Bhuria and Ajay Singh asked Scindia not to put a leg in the ticket distribution
 inhen jhagadon se ummidavaar aakhri vakt main ghoshit ho sake or party ko isaki keemat chukaani padi

 It can be a matter of interest to know what our big leaders eat and drink badly and who are busy in election campaigning
 sabase pehle to ham baat karte hai bijepi ke piem candidet narendra modi kii jo har din ausatan teen badi sabhaayen kar rahe hai
 According to an English newspaper, he likes eating Gujarati food and he only does such food in the evening
 vah bahut kam khate hai or shaam ko amuman khichdi pasand karte hai
 This khichdi makes their own cook
 iske alaava vah yatra ke dauraan lemonade pite rahete hai
 These days he is fasting for Navratri and likes to drink lemon juice in lukewarm water
 congress ke upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi vyastata ke kaaran kabhi-kabhi subah kaa naashtaa nahin kar pate hai
 Instead, he manages to eat prepared noodles
 khud ko tarotaaja rakhane ke liye vah dit cola yaa lemon zeus pite rahete hai
 But his favorite thing is chocolate and this gives him plenty of energy
 vah samudr tateey bhojan pasand karte hai chaahe vah shaakaahaari ho yaa maansaahaari
 Aam Aadmi Party founder Arvind Kejriwal is a diabetic patient
 isliye unhen khaali pet rahanaa manaa he
 He always carries digestive biscuits with him
 jab vah dilli main hote hai to unki patni unhen unka lunch taiyaar karke detii hai
 Kejriwal does not have a fixed menu
 lekin itnaa tay he ki vah masaaledaar bhojan nahin karte kyonki unhen mirch raas nahin aati
 During the campaign, his team takes care of their food and drink
 unhen zeus yaa fal die jate hai
 By the way, Kejriwal likes moong dal
 lekin vah bhune hue chane bahut pasand karte hai
 Although he does not drink cold drinks, he loves Diet Cola
 63 varshiya modi kaa vazan 90 kilo he lekin vah khud ko feet rakhte hai

 He usually gets up from 6 to 7 am and works till late at night
 koi bhi naukari paane ke liye pehle jaruri yogyata kii shart hoti he, phir use naukari milti he, lekin agar naukari pehle de di jaae or jaruri yogyata baad main puri karne kaa vakt diya jaae to ise aap kya kahenge? Some appointments in the Delhi government have been made on this basis
 dilli sarkaar ne mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ke do driveron ke liye is shart ko ulat diya
 Drivers have to pass their tenth within a year and get a commercial license in three months to drive
 isi tarah ek shaks ko clerk banaaya gaya he
 He too was given a year's time to learn typing
 yahi nahin do chaparaasiyon ko bhi niyukt kiya gaya he
 It is also necessary to pass the tenth in a year
 tippaniyan BJP legislator Om Prakash Sharma had written all this information in the assembly
 arvind kejariwal ke mukhyamantri banane ke baad 199 adhikari or karmchaariyon ko yaa to niyukt kiya gaya he yaa duusare vibhaagon se prati niyukti kii gai he, jabaki mukhyamantri karyaalay main 21 karmchaariyon kii niyukti ho sakati he
 Experts say that this kind of appointment is not new
 Other Chief Ministers also keep doing it, but Arvind Kejriwal is claiming to do politics of running separate from other parties
 isi ke chalate unke virdohi unki choti-choti baton kii bhi aalochanaayen chatkhaare lekar karte hai
 Similarly, a person has been made a clerk
 unhen bhi salbhar kaa vakt typing seekhney ke liye diya gaya
 Not only this, two peons have also been appointed
 inhen bhi ek-ek saal main dasvin paas karnaa jaruri he
 The comments bijepi ke vidhayak om prakaash sharma ne likhit taur par vidhansabha main ye sari jaankaree maangi thi
 After Arvind Kejriwal became the Chief Minister, 199 officers and employees have either been appointed or recruited from other departments, while 21 employees may be appointed in the Chief Minister's office
 jaankaar kehete hai ki is tarah kii niyukti koi nai nahin he duusare mukhyamantri bhi karte rahete hai, lekin arvind kejariwal duusari partiyon se alag chalane kii raajnneeti karne kaa daawa kar rahe hai
 Due to this, their opponents also criticize their small things with flattery

 Arvind Kejriwal, the national convener of the Aam Aadmi Party, requested the Congress to contest elections several times
 lekin dilli congress is gathbandhan ke khilaaf he
 Congress President Rahul Gandhi held several meetings with the leaders of Delhi Congress for this
 apane netaaon ke saath baithak ke baad rahul gandhi ne elaan kiya tha ki congress dilli main aam aadmi party ke saath gathbandhan nahin karegi

 jiesti par rodmap pesh karte hue vittamantri arun jetali ne kaha ki jiesti sarvasammati se paas hua he
 Most of the state governments also wanted this bill
 janata bhi chaahati thi ki desh main ek tex ho
 The comments jetali ne kaha ki jiesti ke aane ke baad lambe samay main tex kii daren kam hongi or kam tex hone se keemten bhi ghatengi
 He said, once GST is implemented, it will become easier to do business in India

 He said that now our aim is to put the necessary laws before the Parliament in the year 2017 to implement GST, but before that additional amendments made by the Rajya Sabha will have to be placed in the Lok Sabha

 rithik roshan kii 'krish 3' ban gai he bollywood main sabase zyada kamai karne vaali film
 Earlier, the record was named after Shah Rukh Khan starrer 'chennai Express', which earned a record Rs 227 crore at the box office this year
 chennai express ne aamir khan kii '3 idiyats' (2009) kaa record todaa tha
 Let me tell you that '3 Idiots' became the highest collecting film with a gross of 202 crores and it held its record for three consecutive years
 lekin is saal relies hui 'chennai express ne 227 karod rupee kii kamai kar ye record tod diya
 Now a few months later 'krrish 3' broke the record of 'chennai Express'
 gauratlab he ki 'krish 3' ek november ko relies hui thi or film 16 november tak 231 karod rupee tak kama chuki he or kamai kaa silsilaa abhi bhi jari he
 The funny thing is that both Krrish 3 and Chennai Express have a record of earning Rs 100 crore within four days of release
 kahanikar prem bharadwaj ke is sangrah kii adhikansh kahaniyon main rajnatik or saamaajik shaktiyon ke khilaaf pratirodh kii aakul abhivyakti he
 Creators conscious of social concerns have sharpened the visual-invisible realities around us, disturbing events and tangible and intangible details of shattering lives
 gaanv ho yaa shahar, nimna varg ho yaa madhyavarg, rajnatik, prashasnic daanvpench se trast aamajan kii kaatar pukaar ho yaa sarkari daman kii shikaar stri kii vyathaa-katha-kahanikar kii drushti se kuch bhi oot main nahin rah gaya he
 Whether it is the death of the collection's best story city, whether it is characters like Anita of guilt or the introspection of the rooted story's protagonist, the storyteller succinctly succumbs to touching the heart with simplistic language
 lekin aasmaan chup he mukhar dhang se sampradayik samasya kii prishthbhumi main rachi gai yatharthparak kahani he
 Writer concern draws readers' attention to the influx of bourgeoisism and contradictory faces, their characters and transitional characters emerging in progressive organizations through characters such as unemployment, Naxalism, social asymmetry stemming from the Babri demolition, and revolutionary partner Somada
 sheershak kahani intjaar paanchaven sapane kaa pragatishiltaa ke naam par khadey kiye gaye aise tamaam sanghathanon main panpate avasarwaadi palaayanwaad, hinsa or party ke holtimer paatr kii bebasii, chatapataahat, udaasi, hataasha, andruni tuutfoot or dhire-dhire dhahte jate vajood kii maarmik katha he
 In such stories, the creator, with a conscious mind, becomes a partner in a long battle of concerns and stands up against social forces
 kahin-kahin par lekhak khud ko pravaktaa banane se nahin roak paata
 In most of the stories, the common man's life struggle, powerlessness, torture of being a man under the auspices of the memories of the past is ruthlessly exposed
 halke-phulke shailpic prayog ko chhod den to adhikansh kahaniyaan bhashik chamatkaaron se pare jaakar alag dhang se yatharth kii jameen par buni gai hai
 The subjective dialogue of the artificial world steeped in the fluidity of love, beauty and love, created through abundant imaginations, gradually touches the big questions, raising the narrative of the common man, raising the voice of humanity
 kaalpanik anandalok khadaa karnaa sambhawatah lekhak kii manshaa na rahi ho, isiilie paatro kii kathabhumi yatharth kaa daaman nahin chhod paati
 The beautiful story called Fantasy definitely creates the magic of fictional hypnosis in a unique way, by which the reader spontaneously reaches out to an innocent world where a world completely different from deceit, rancor, opportunism or selfishness
 prem or kalatmak saundarya ke tayshuda pratimaan rachane kii bajaae lekhak ne chuni he yatharth kii khurduri chattan jis par khadey hokar usne khud ladane kii thaanee he sarokaaron kii lambii ladaai
 In spite of the sensation flowing on such a land, why would a quiver burst? Stories have left traces of the leaking springs somewhere between these rocks

 10, Akhilesh said that he has started a new scheme for laborers working under hard sunlight, under which laborers will now get a plate for 10 rupees
 ye bhojan unhen unke kaarysthal par bhi muhaiyaa karaayaa jayega
 'we work and will continue to work, but you have to see, we have been serving you for thirteen years
 kaam jo kiya he uski mazaduri maangane aae hai or hamaare liye mazaduri he, jo vot hone vaala he, tir kaa batan dabaa dijiega

 In this fashion, the Chief Minister of Bihar and National President of Janata Dal United (JDU) Nitish Kumar are seeking votes for their candidates
 nitish kumaar (nitish Kumar) har din teen se chaar sabhaayen karte hai
 Everywhere, either their party candidates or their allies' candidates ask for votes on their work
 shuukravaar ko belaganj main party ke pratyaashee vijay maanjhi, jo purv saansad bhagavatiyaan devi ke putr hai, ke samarthan main nitish ne logon ko yaad dilaayaa ki kaise unhone maanjhi samaaj ke ikon dasharath maanjhi ke sammaan main koi kasar nahin chodi
 However, after taking the name of Gaya seat candidate Jitan Ram Manjhi, Nitish said that after the defeat in the last Lok Sabha election, he made him Chief Minister but he started taunting against his government
 nitish (nitish Kumar) ko maaloom he ki maanjhi samaaj main jeethanram ko hataane se naaraazgi he isliye ve kehete hai ki agar thik se rahete to ve aaj bhi kursi par bane rahete
 In the speech of Nitish Kumar, the sentences praising Prime Minister Narendra Modi (PM Narendra Modi) are not very much
 ve lekin itnaa zarur kehete hai ki modi ji ke samay main desh main tarakkee, pratishtha or har kshetra main kaam hua he
 And then also of those people, they talk about the speech of Ram Vilas Paswan with them that they have counted all the works of the central government and then they do not want to repeat it
 iske baad ve bihar main apane kaamon kaa zikr shuru karte hai jisamen saat nishchay ke kaam kii khaskar, har ghar nalka jal or har ghar bijli se logon ko jo laabh ho rahaa he uski vistaar se charchaa karte hai
 At the same time, his opponents do not forget to object to Kaskar RJD that now there is no need for a red team of politicians doing politics with the help of lanterns in Bihar because now Bihar is consuming 5200 MW of power every day
 nitish (nitish Kumar) na to lalu or na hi tejasvi kaa naam lete hai lekin bhaashan ke shuru main hi apane bare main tejasvi dwaara bhaashanon or twit main galat shabdon ke prayog par unki pidaa jhalak jaati he
 Then Nitish reminds people to remember the earlier era how there used to be a road in a pit or a pit in the road
 ye maaloom karnaa mushkil hota tha
 Nitish then says that he has come to ask for votes on the basis of work
 is mudde par ve kisi ke bhi saath bahes ke liye taiyaar hai
 Nitish Kumar's speech shows his feelings towards the minority community, especially the Muslim community
 unke bhaashanon se saaf lagata he ki unhen maaloom he ki muslim samudaay shaayad is chunaav main unhen saport nahin de, isliye ve baar-baar alpsankhyak samudaay ke liye kiye gaye kaam kii charchaa karte hai
 Remind them what was the status of the madrasa earlier and now what has happened to the madrasa
 nitish ghoshnaa karte hai ki alpsankhyak awasaiya vidhyalay ke nirmaan kaa kaam loksabhaa chunaav ke baad nishchit rup se shuru ho jayega
 Without naming Lalu or Tejashwi, they say that some people want to come to power because they want to get nuts
 ant main nitish ek vaakya kahana nahin bhoolatey ki loktantr main janata maalik he

 According to the Financial Times report, 25 grams of drugs were recovered from Ness Wadia, after which he was sentenced
 is maamle main wadiya ko march maheene main japan se giraftaar kiya gaya tha
 After the news of the arrest, the Wadia group has said that Ness Wadia is in India and the verdict is clear that this is a suspended sentence

 He will continue to discharge his role within and outside the group
 ness wadiya bharat ke sabase amir kaarobaari gharaanon main shumaar wadiya samooh ke vaaris or nusli wadiya ke bete hai
 According to the report, Nes Wadia was caught with 25 grams of drugs at New Chitose Airport on Hokkaido Island, Japan
 report main yah bhi daawa kiya gaya ki jab ness wadio ko giraftaar kiya gaya, us samay unhone drugs ko apane paas rakhane kii baat bhi sweekaar kii thi
 He said that he had kept the drugs with him for use
 aapako bataa den ki isse pehle saal 2014 main abhinetri priti jinta ne ness wadiya par ek match ke dauraan pratadit karne kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 The charge sheet was filed by the Mumbai police in February 2018 after four years in the case
 haalanki baad main priti jinta ne cese waapas le liya tha
 Australian cricket Luke Pombersbach has confessed that he molested an American woman with alcohol
 iske baad hue jhagade main america mahila johal hamid ke mangetar ke saath maar-peet hui thi
 The comments luk ne yah bayaan main dhara 161 ke tahat dilli police ko diya he
 Earlier, he had turned away from this act in the media
 ab sabhi ko is baat kaa intjaar he ki vah adaalat main kya bayaan dete hai
 Let me tell you that American woman Johal Hameed, who was a victim of IPL cricketer Luke Pomersbach of Royal Challengers Bangalore, alleged that the cricketer tried to kiss her and when he refused to take a drink with her, he punched her fiance with several punches
 
 ipel party ke baad shahar ke ek paanch sitara hotel main pomerbash ne us mahila ke saath kathith taur par chhedchhad kii or uske mangetar ko peeta
 Luke has given this statement to Delhi Police under Section 161
 pehle vah media main apni is harakat se mukar gaye the
 Now everyone is waiting for what statement he makes in the court
 bataa den ki royal chalangers bangalore ke ipel cricketer luk pommersbatch se chhedchhad kii shikaar america mahila johal hamid ne aarope lagaaya tha ki cricketer ne uskaa chumban lene kii koshish kii or jab unhone uske saath drink lene se inkaar kiya to usne uske mangetar ko kai ghunse jade
 Pomerbash allegedly molested the woman and beat her fiancée after an IPL party at a five-star hotel in the city

 cricket vishwa cap 2019 ke pehle semifinal main bharat ko newjiland se haar mili he
 With this defeat, India's World Cup dream has been shattered
 is romaanchak mukaable main bharat ne kadaa sangharsh kiya, lekin newjiland bharat se behatar sabit hua
 Sachin Tendulkar, who was a member of the 2011 Cricket World Cup winning team India, has discussed the matter
 sachin tendulkar ne kaha ki main niraash hum kyonki hamen 240 kaa target puraa kar lenaa chahie tha
 However, Kane Williamson's captaincy was excellent
 unhone is match ke dauraan behtareen field setting lagaai
 This is why Kohli got stuck in front of the bolt
 lekin ye bhi sach he ki aap har baar apane top form khilaadiyon par nirbhar nahin rah sakate hai
 When we win we win as a team and when we lose we lose as a team
 chauthe number ke ballebaaj ke bare main baat karte hue sachin ne kaha ki ye team par nirbhar karata he ki captain or management aisi najuk sthiti main kise batting ke liye bhejte hai
 i think things could have been different had Dhoni been at number 5
 dhoni, jadeja kii pari ke dauraan unase lagaataar baat kar rahe the or or unka game dekhakar aisa laga ki ve puri paristhiti ko control kar rahe the
 i feel that after being an explosive batsman of the middle order, when players like Hardik Pandya and Pant needed to be partnered, they lost their wickets
 darasal unhen is paristhiti main alag tareeke ke mindset kii jarurat thi
 Pant would have been at number 4 and Dhoni at number 5 and would have tried to control things with Pant in the same way as he did with Jadeja and if Pant and Hardik would have got 5-7 overs with MS Dhoni, the situation would have been some Could have been more
 ho saktaa he ki team kii ranneeti ye rahi ho ki dinesh karthik ko number 5 par bhejkar newjiland kii swing ko control karne kii koshish kii ja sake or gend ko zyada se zyada purana kiya ja sake taaki aakhir main dhoni or jadeja jaise sitare game ko bharat kii jholii main daal sake
 But there is no doubt that there is a lot of pressure on the middle order as soon as India's top three batsmen are dismissed and since India's top three batsmen are doing well in the whole tournament, then with their cheap tackle The middle order was exposed
 mujhe lagata he ki rohit kii is match ko lekar aalochana karnaa anfere hoga
 He has done well throughout the tournament but i was hoping that KL Rahul should have done well
 unhone pichley match main shandaar shatak banaaya lekin mujhe unki batting main thodi negative energy dekhne ko mili
 i saw the same thing in Kohli as he was trying to hit the ball going out as soon as he came on the pitch, due to which Bolt caught him on the inswinger after a few outswingers
 mujhe lagata he ki pressure ke chalate bhi bharat kii parformens par fark padaa
 Talking about Jadeja, he said that this morning when Jadeja got Ross Taylor out, we were talking in the commentary box that today is going to be Jadeja's day and finally it happened
 unhone newjiland ko apni batting se hairaan kar diya tha
 The sound coming from his bat was fantastic
 haalanki ye durbhagyapurna he ki ve hamaare liye match ko bachaa nahin paae
 Based on conversation with Boria Majumdar bijepi ke maardarshak mandal ke sadsy or party ke varishthatam netaa laal krishna adwani (LK Advani) ek baar phir lok sabha chunaav ladenge yaa nahin, party ne yah faisla unheen par chhod diya he
 According to some BJP leaders, there is no restriction on the election of seventy-five leaders like Advani, LK Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi, Sumitra Mahajan, Shanta Kumar, BC Khandudi, Hukum Dev Narayan Yadav, BS Yeddyurappa is
 unka kahana he ki aisa niyam chunaav ladane ke bare main nahin he
 But it is certain that if they win the election then no ministerial post will be given to these leaders from beyond the 75
 bijepi netaaon kaa yah bhi kahana he ki videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj (sushma swaraj) kaa chunaav na ladane kaa faisla unka apana he or party ne is bare main abhi tak koi faisla nahin kiya he
 Sushma Swaraj and Uma Bharti have decided not to contest elections in terms of health
 haalanki abhi yah jaankaree nahin he ki 91 saal ke adwani or 84 saal ke joshi phir chunaav ladanaa chahenge yaa nahin
 According to sources close to Joshi, whatever the party decides, they will accept it
 gauratlab he ki bijepi ke vayovruddh netaa laal krishna adwani, murali manohar joshi, shanta kumaar or bi si khandudi ko 2014 main chunaav jeetne ke baavjood sarkaar main shaamil nahin kiya gaya tha
 According to sources, Advani was keen on becoming the Speaker of the Lok Sabha
 lekin party ne yah jimmedaari sumitra mahajan ko saunpi
 Not only that, those ministers who were inducted into the Modi cabinet in May 2014 were later removed which later crossed 75 years
 inamen cabinet mantri najma hepatulla or calraj mishra jaise varisht netaa shaamil hai
 The anger of these elderly leaders has been intermittent when kept away from the government
 bihar vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi kii haar ke baad adwani, joshi or yashavanth sinha jaise netaaon ne patr likh kar netritv par sawaal khadey kiye the
 Advani has openly expressed his displeasure within the House several times for not functioning in the Lok Sabha
 madhya pradesh main aise hi ek umradraj bijepi netaa babulal gaur ne party kii naak main dam kar rakhaa he
 He himself wanted to contest the recent assembly elections
 baad main party ne unki bahu ko tikat dekar unhen manaaya
 Now he is threatening the party by saying that the Congress wants to make him a candidate from Bhopal Lok Sabha seat
 ek anya bujurg netaa sartaaj singh ko shivaraj singh chouhan sarkaar se 75 saal kii umr paar kar lene ke baad hataa diya gaya tha
 He was rebel in the assembly elections and contested from Hoshangabad on Congress ticket
 haalanki unki haar ho gai
 In the changed situation of Uttar Pradesh, BJP cannot afford to separate the strong Brahmin leaders like Murali Manohar Joshi and Kalraj Mishra from the electoral battle
 khaastaur se tab jabaki congress ne priyanka gandhi wadra ko purvanchal kii jimmedaari saunpi he
 The Congress is trying to bring the Brahmin voters who play a decisive role in this area
 calraj mishra purvanchal kii devaria or murali manohar joshi kanpur se lok sabha saansad hai
 a good news has emerged amid all the disappointing news
 bharat ne japan ko peeche chhodkar duniya kii teesri sabase badi arthvyavastha banane kaa gaurav paa liya he
 This has been said in a report by the World Bank
 ek angreji akhbaar ne yah khabar di he
 PPP is the basis for this result
 pipipi kaa puraa arth he parcheging power parity or isse do deshon ke logon ke saamaan kharidne kii shakti kaa pataa chalata he
 Such comparisons are considered far better and more accurate than comparisons based on foreign exchange
 2011 ke banks international comperijan program (isipi) ke anusaar bharat, america or china ke baad tisare number kii arthvyavastha ban gaya he
 India was ranked tenth in the 2005 survey
 pipipi ke jariye arthvyavasthaaon or logon kii aay ko vibhinn deshon main keemton ke fark se napa jaataa he
 This makes a meaningful comparison possible
 2011 main vishwa kii kul jidipi main bharat kaa hissaa 6
 4 percent while China's 14
 9 or america kaa 17
 1 percent
 is survey main 199 deshon ko shaamil kiya gaya he
 This report of the World Bank says that America is currently the number one economy, while China is second
 tisare number par bharat he jabaki japan uske peeche he
 India has left him behind
 haal ke samay man bharat main baari mudrasphiti ke baavjood desh main mahangaai viksit deshon kii chulanaa main kaaphi kam he
 That is, the rate at which goods are found here is found at much more expensive rates abroad
 lekin imef kii report ke mutabik bharat kii arthvyavastha abhi 12wein nabar par he or japan kii sirf ek tihaai he
 But it is a calculation based on dollars
 maharashtra kii mahila or bal vikaas mantri pankaja munde phir se vivaadon main hai
 The Aam Aadmi Party has alleged that Pankaja misused his position and distributed tenders to black-listed companies and violated the guidelines of the Supreme Court
 pankaja ne in aaropon ko niraadhaar bataaya he
 Aam Aadmi Party leader Preeti Sharma Menon alleges that Munde has molested the Anganwadi scheme
 priti ne apane aaropon main bijepi adhyaksh raav sahib daanve kaa naam bhi liya he
 In a press conference, Preity said that in many decisions of the Center and the Supreme Court, it has been clearly stated that the supply of nutritious food items will not be taken from the self-help groups and women circles running in the villages, but by Pankaja Munde, the contract companies
 Quote pankaja ne tech home rashan kaa 88 fisadi kantrect aisi companiyon ko diya jinhen supreme court ne blike list kar rakhaa tha
 The names of these companies are - Vyankateshwar Industrial Produce Governmental Limited, Mahalaxmi Mahila Griha Udyog and Child Development Multipurpose Industrial Cooperative Institute and Maharashtra Mahila Sahakari Griha Udyog Sansthan Limited
 AAP kaa aarope he ki pankaja ne tech home rashan ke liye tender is tarah nikaala ki sirf ye teen companiyaan hi daud main rahen baaki baahar ho jaaen or inhen 4805

 After this proclamation, Noida Sector 24 police arrested two of Radhe's friends Vikas Rana and Shripal, but this incident brought back the madness of the life of restraint and appearance among the youth

 Once, he even posted pictures of country-made pistols and bullets on his timeline and then finally wrote, "friends, i want to take revenge on someone
 
 
 tum meraa saath do!” lekin tab bhi kisi ko radhe ke mansoobey kaa andaja nahin tha
 Noida SSP Praveen Kumar says, "we had no information about any such Facebook status of Radhe

 The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Thursday sought to know from the central government why the inquiry into money transactions in the alleged wrong allocation of coal blocks has not been ordered so far? BJP leader Prakash Javadekar said that according to market sources, the allottees Bribed from 50 to 100 rupees for each ton of coal
 jaavdekar ne kaha, 've chaahate hai ki ham is par bharosa kar len ki ek karod 70 lakh ton koyale kaa aavanton swatantra rup se kiya gaya
 Market sources say that a bribe of Rs 50 to 100 per ton of coal was given
 kya sarkaar is maamle main nyaayik jaanch karaane ke liye taiyaar he?
 He lashed out at Rural Development Minister Jairam Ramesh, who asked the BJP to 'look within' on the allocation of coal blocks
 jaavdekar ne kaha, 'sabase pehle jairam ramesh ko ek sawaal kaa jawaab dena chahie ki koyala block ke aavanton ke aadesh par kisne hastakshar kiye
 Secondly, Congress always says that Chief Ministers of BJP ruled states wrote letters

 Congress leaders are not showing those letters
 ' On 29 January, Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke specifically about cbse's 10th and 12th board exams in 'mann Ki Baat'
 man kii baat main piem kii exam ke liye chaatro ko salaah- smil mor, score morain parikshaon ke number kai achche collejon main admician kaa paimaana banate hai
 At the same time, the number of students' intelligent base also forms
 yahi vajah ko lekar students bahat tanaav main rahete hai
 Parents also pressurize children to score as much as possible, which often leads to student exam stresses
 board kii parikshaon main behatar score kaise kiya jaae, ise lekar pradhanmantri modi ne kuch khaas points bataae hai
 
 
 
 jab bhavuk ho gaye PM modiap bhi jaane in baton ko or is baar board main bina kisi dabaav ke 90% se zyada number paaen-1
 Focus on knowledge rather than focusing on numbers
 isse aapke concept clear honge or sibiesai kii pariksha main ghumaakar puche gaye sawaalon ko bhi aap aasaani se hal kar paaenge
 2
 smil mor and score mor! pariksha ko lekar man par boj na rakhen
 Take it like a celebration
 yani jis tarah tyoharon par dil se khushi manaai jaati he, usee tarah pariksha ke dinon main man lagaakar padhai karen
 3
 pariksha ke dinon main uchit aaraam bhi jaruri he
 Take a break of 10-15 minutes between one to two hours of study
 jaisaa ki pradhanmantri modi ne kaha - jo padhe wo khele bhi or jo khele wo khile
 4
 CBSE kii 10veen-12veen kii parikshaon ko lekar pradhanmantri modi ne chaatro ko tanaav se bachane kii salaah di he
 He said- The biggest drug to recall memory is relapse
 tanaav se yaaddaasht par bura asar padataa he
 Take a deep breath to relieve tension
 5
 Prime Minister Modi asked parents not to burden their expectations on children
 unhone samajhaayaa ki apekshaayen raah main baadhaaen laati hai, jabaki avasthaa ko swikaarne se rasta aasaan hota he
 6
 nakal karne main dimag lagane se behatar he ki utana dhyaan padhrai main lagaaya jaae
 Prime Minister Modi said that in the amount of time and mind spent in planning the copy, preparation of good numbers can be done easily
 Board Exams: nahin lagata padhane main man, to kuch aisa karen7
 The PM gave the students the former President and the great scientist Dr
 apije abdul kalam se prerana lene kii salaah di
 He said that having competition (like yourself) like Sachin will take you further
 vahiin exam main fail hone ke matlab jindagi main haarana nahin he
 Please tell that former President Kalam also failed in the Air Force exam
 vaise, piem ne kaha ki pariksha or ank kaa aapke jivan main simit mahatv he
 Do not understand it all

 Illegal migrants will get valid documents without being told the violation of the Citizenship Agreement, the protesting government is preparing to introduce the citizenship amendment bill in the winter session
 naagarikta sanshodhan bilka purvottar ke rajya virodh kar rahe hai
 The people of the Northeast are describing this bill as playing with the cultural, linguistic and traditional heritage of the states
 rashtriya naagarik register (enarasi) kaa final draft aane ke baad assam main virodh-pradarshan bhi hue the
 However, the people who are not named in it, gave the government a chance to complain
 supreme court ne enarasi se baahar hue logon ke saath sakhti baratane par roak laga di thi
 Now, as the government is going to bring the Citizenship Amendment Bill, the protest is once again becoming vocal
 kya he naagarikta sanshodhan bilanaagarikta sanshodhan bill naagarikta adhinium 1955 ke praavdhaanon ko badalane ke liye pesh kiya ja rahaa he, jisase naagarikta pradaan karne se sambandhit niyamon main badlaav hoga
 This amendment to the citizenship bill will pave the way for Hindus from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan as well as for Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians to gain Indian citizenship without valid documents
 kam ho jaaegi nivas avadhibharat kii naagarikta hasil karne ke liye desh main 11 saal nivas karne vaale log yogya hote hai
 The citizenship amendment bill provides for reducing the duration of residency for refugees from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan from 11 years to 6 years
 kyon ho rahaa he virodhise sarkaar kii ore seavaidh pravaasiyonki paribhaasha badalane ke prayaas ke rup main dekha ja rahaa he
 The Congress and the All India United Democratic Front are opposing the grant of citizenship on religious grounds as the basis for providing citizenship to people of non-muslim 6 faith
 naagarikta adhinium main is sanshodhan ko 1985 ke assam qaraar kaa ulanghan bhi bataaya ja rahaa he, jisamen san 1971 ke baad bangladesh se aae sabhi dharmon ke nagarikon ko nirvasit karne kii baat thi
 Asam Gana Parishad (AGP), a coalition partner of the BJP that is running the government with the BJP in Assam, is also opposing the Citizenship Amendment Bill, against the cultural and linguistic identity of the local people
 assam main enarasi ko apadet karne kii prakriya bhi jari he
 In such a situation, people are protesting that NRC is ineffective in the event of citizenship amendment bill being implemented

 darasal dibisi (domestic breeding chekar) ghar-ghar jaakar machharon kii utpatti ko jaanchane kaa kaam karte hai

 iske kaaran pehle to wo emsidi mukhyalay par pradarshan karenge or uske baad bhi maange nahin maani gayi to kareeb 3 hajaar dibisi varkar hadtaal par chale jaaenge
 DBC workers say they were promised a permanent job, but that promise was not fulfilled
 iske alaava dibisi karmchaariyon ne aarope lagaaya he ki unhen beete teen maheenon se selary bhi nahin mili he
 This has made it difficult for DBC workers to drive home
 bataa den ki dibisi workars ne isi saal april main apni maangon ko lekar emsidi mukhyalay sivik centre parabukh hadtaalki thi
 The strike was also supported by the opposition Aam Aadmi Party and Congress
 iske baad emsidi netaaon ke aashwaasan ke baad dibisi workars ne hadtaal khatm kar di
 Now DBC employees allege that they are not getting salary even if they agree to the demand
 ravivaar ko dibisi karmchaariyon ne elaan kiya he ki aagaamee 12 june or 15 june ko emsidi mukhyalay ke get par dibisi karmchaaree pradarshan karenge
 Thereafter, an indefinite strike will be held if the demand is not met

 Former Indian cricket captain Anil Kumble believes that Virat Kohli has the 'right game' to fit a crucial third place in the Indian Test batting order
 unhone haalanki saath hi kaha ki kisi ke liye bhi rahul dravid kii jagah lenaa asambhav hoga
 Kumble said, 'I have kept a close watch on Virat since he played under-19 and he has matured a lot
 khel, anushaasan or fitness ke maamle main pichley ek saal main usne jis tarah kaa sudhaar kiya he usase main prabhavit hum
 "he has kept pace with the tight international cricket and it is fantastic for the 23-year-old to do so," he said
 austrailia main usne test cricket main shatak jamaaya or meraa maananaa he ki tisare sthaan par feet hone ke liye uske saath sahi khel he
 'this former captain said,' However no one can replace Rahul Dravid
 pichley 16 baras main usne uplabdhiyaan hasil kii hai or nishchit taur par 23 hajaar antarrashtriya ran bananaa aasaan nahin hoga
 Appreciating Sachin Tendulkar for achieving the historic feat of 100 international centuries, Kumble said that he is fast adapting to various situations which are a sign of great sportsman
 kumble ne kaha, ‘main in 100 shatak main se 80 kaa gavaah rahaa or kam se kam 20 maukon par duusare chor par khadaa tha
 i used to come to bat when he was already around 80 and the new ball was about to be taken
 prayek avasar par meraa kaam hota he ki main apana wicket aasaani se nahin ganvaau jisase ki use shatak banane main madad mil sake
 Tendulkar recalled strange incidents during his best score of 248 against Bangladesh after completing his 100th century when he and Kumble fell victim to misunderstandings several times
 kumble ne kaha, ‘is bare main baat nahin karo
 i still get embarrassed when i see the footage of that match
 ’ is purv bhartiya captain ke liye ek yaadgaar ghatana 1990 main old traverd main tendulkar kaa pehla test shatak he jo kumble kaa padaarpan test bhi tha
 He said, 'I was kept standing in the balcony of Old Trafford for over three hours because it was Kiran More's decree
 sachin ran bana rahaa tha or ham test bachaane ke liye khel rahe the isliye sabhi andhvishwasi ho gaye the
 It was difficult to stand there for two hours but Kiran instructed me to stand in the same position for hours
 keval chaay ke vishram ke dauraan mujhe baithne kaa mauka miltaa tha
 'kumble said,' Of course the innings of 242 runs in Sydney was another unmatched effort where he did not hit a single cover drive until 200 runs were completed
 pakistan ke khilaaf 100 or austrailia ke khilaaf 155 ran (donon chennai main) jab shen warn round da wicket gendbaaji kar rahe the, unki kuch paariyaan hai jinhen main kabhi nahin bhul saktaa
 Test cricket is still a priority for Kumble, who took 619 Test matches and 337 wickets in odis
 pichley chah maheene se bhartiya team ke saath jude hone ke dauraan keval paanch match (teen vanade or do tii20) khilne vaale leg spinner rahul sharma ke bare main kumble ne kaha ki yah ajeeb sthiti he
 He said, 'you have to throw a lot of overs in a match, but you also have to choose your best team
 adarsh sthiti yah hoti ki rahul kuch pratham shrenee match kheltaa lekin aajkal samasya yah he ki daure par abhyaas match kaaphi kam hote hai
 When i went to England in 1990, we played nine first-class matches in addition to two odis and three Tests
 sabhi ko mauka mila tha jo ab nahin hota
 Kumble, however, refrained from speaking about his brief tenure of one year as president at the National Cricket Academy in Bangalore
 unhone pichley saal disambar main apane pad se istipha de diya tha
 He said, 'I don't want to talk about that time
 main kuch chijen karnaa chahta tha lekin sarvasammati nahin thi lekin ensie ne bhartiya cricket ke liye kaaphi kuch acha kiya he
 Due to NCA, we have great fielders like Virat, Suresh Raina, Manoj Tiwari
 ’bisisiai chahta he ki ranjai trophy match tatasth sthanon par khele jaaen lekin kumble chaahate hai ki cricket chote kendron par sthanantarit ho jisase achche pratispardhi wicket milenge
