 It all started when Congress President Rahul Gandhi arrived in Rajasthan on Monday for campaigning in the famous Pushkar temple amid election campaign
 puja karaane vaale pujari ke mutabik “ rahul gandhi ne bataaya ki unka gotra dattatreya he
 Dattatreya is a Kaul and Kaul is a Kashmiri Brahmin
 ”is ghatnakram ke tatkaal baad bijepi netaaon or samarthakon ne gotra ko lekar congress adhyaksh par nishaanaa sadhana shuru kar diya
 Union Minister Giriraj Singh also uploaded a clip of the film 'jolly LLB' in his tweet
 is clip main ek muslim kirdaar ‘brahman pujari’ kaa farji vesh dhare hue hota he leki gotra puche jane par uskaa jhooth pakadaa jaataa he
 Thousands shared it and responded
 kai bijepi samarthakon ne rahul par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha- rahul dattatreya gotra se kaise ho sakate hai jabaki unke dada (firoz gandhi) hindu nahin the
 In Hindu tradition, a person inherits his gotra from his father

 com / bhv060ur3q— Shandilya Giriraj Singh (@girirajsinghbjp)november 26, 2018rahul gandhi se jude gotra vivaad ko lekar india today aapke liye un sabhi sawaalon ke jawaab le kar aayaa he jinhen ki aap jaananaa chaahate hai
 What is gotra? According to the famous historian AL Basham, the word 'gotra' actually originated from Goshala and was first used in the Atharva Veda
 apni kitaab ‘da vander dait vaaz india’ main basham likhte hai- ‘saare brahman rishiyon main se ek yaa puranic siddh purushon ke vanshaj maane jate hai jinase unke gotra ke naam pade
 According to Basham, marriages are prohibited in the same gotra as people of the same gotra are considered descendants of the same ancestors
 samajashastri or tejpur central uniwarsity main professor chandan kumaar sharma ne kaha,”‘gotra’ vyavastha paaramparik taur par brahmanvaadi he or purush pradhan satta se judi he
 "because one gets gotra from his father and not from mother
 neharuon ko kaise unka upnaam mila or unka gotra kya he?pandit moti laal nehru ke purvaj kaul brahman the or kashmir ke rahane vaale the
 The gotra of Kaul Brahmins in Kashmir is Dattatreya
 1716 main unke purvaj pandit raaj kaul dilli main shift ho gaye or nahar ke kinare bane ek ghar main rahane lage
 People started calling him Nehru
 nehru yani nahar ke kinare rahane vaale
 Later he removed Kaul and started using only Nehru as a surname
 rahul gandhi ke dada firoz gandhi kaa dharm kya tha?firoz jahangir ghandi (indira gandhi ke pati or rahul gandhi ke dada) kaa janm parsi parivaar main 12 sitambar 1912 ko mumbai ke tahamulaji nariman aspataal main hua tha
 Feroze's father Jahangari Ferdun Ghandi was a Marine engineer from Bharuch, Gujarat, according to 'firoz - The Forgotten Gandhi', a biography written by Swedish journalist Bertil Falk on Feroze Gandhi
 wo parsi samudaay ke dharmik vyakti the
 Feroze was his fifth and final child
 jab wo kuch hi maheene ke the to unki rishtedaar shirin kamiscerriott ne unhen god le liya
 Shirin was a doctor and lived in Allahabad
 shirin avivaahit thim lekin unhone firoz ko apane bete kii tarah paala
 Ramachandra Guha has written in his book 'india After Gandhi' that Feroze changed his surname from 'ghandi' to 'gandhi' after joining the freedom movement after being influenced by Mahatma Gandhi
 haalanki kai logon kaa maananaa he ki firoz, mahatma gandhi se kisi tarah rishte se jude the, jo ki sach nahin he
 Did Feroze Gandhi adopt Hindutva? There is no firm evidence indicating that Feroze Gandhi would embrace Hinduism after his marriage to Indira
 nehru bhi sirf shaadi ke liye dharm parivartan ke khilaaf the
 But due to the inter-caste marriage, the customs of the marriage will be, then it was a complex question
 saath hi us vakt tak antarjaatiy vivaah ko agar wo sirf hindu reeti rivaaj se hota tha to use kanoonee manyata bhi praapt nahin thi
 It was necessary to do a civil marriage in court
 firoz or indira ne kya apni shaadi ke reeti-rivaajon ke baad civil marij bhi kii thi, isko lekar kai tarah kii theory hai
 According to Vinod Mehta's book, 'the Sanjay Story', 'feroze adopted Hinduism to satisfy orthodox views about Hindu laws, and to avoid any possible legal objections
 donon ne kashmir main chote honeymoon ke baad civil marij bhi kii
 Mehta said in his book Ye Tak, other biographers and observers have also confirmed that Feroze converted to religion and followed the path of civil marriage
 haalanki kitaab ke mutabik jab indira gandhi se firoz ke dharm parivartan ke bare main poocha gaya tha unhone jor dekar khandan karte hue kaha tha- ‘nishchit rup se nahin
 "rahul's claim to be Kaul Brahmin with Dattatreya gotra? It is clear that Rahul Gandhi is claiming to be of Dattatreya gotra based on his father's maternal grandfather Jawaharlal Nehru's lineage
" aitihaasik recordon ke mutabik indira gandhi ne bhi isi pushkar mandir main apana gotra pita vaala hi bataaya tha
 However according to many sociologists, this is not in accordance with Hindu traditions
 dilli uniwarsity ke itihaaskaar dow prem choudhary kehete hai, ‘agar koi vyakti hindutv ko apanaataa bhi he to use gotra nahin miltaa
 Therefore, even after Feroze Gandhi's adoption of Hinduism, he never got a gotra according to Hindu tradition
 ’firoz ke dharm ko lekar vivaad unke nidhan ke baad bhi nahin thama tha
 His last rites were performed according to both Hindu and Parsi traditions
 firoz gandhi kii parthiv deh kaa dilli main dah sanskaar hua tha
 Later, his ashes were kept in the Parsi Cemetery in Allahabad

 somvaar ko punjab sarkaar ne rajya parivahan kii bason me ashleel or bhadakaau gaanon ke play par paabandi laga di he
 State Transport Minister Ajit Singh Kohler, while issuing the prohibition order to the concerned department on the poetic songs, said that strict action will be taken against the bus drivers who violate the government order

 Tyagi said whether the Supreme Court has given any order to implement NRC in Kishanganj or other places in Bihar? That some people keep making rhetoric about implementing NRC in Bihar also to be in the discussion
 supreme court ne abhi rashtriya str par enarasi lagu karne ko lekar koi nirdesh nahin diya he
 The JDU general secretary said that if NRC came into force in Assam, it happened on the orders of the Supreme Court
 aise main bihar main bhi enarasi lagu karne kii baat kaa koi matlab nahin he
 If some people make a statement then keep giving, JDU does not mean anything to him

 Viewers were more in number and buyers were less visible
 beshak dilli main chal rahe pandrah din ke prayog kaa asar bhi meley par saaf najar aa rahaa tha
 9 was the date i
e
 the aud number
 is din od number kii gaadiyaan chalani thim, isliye meley main pahunchane vaale logon kii sankhya kaaphi kam ho hi gai thi
 a publication present in the fair accepted this fact
 vahinkitabonke ek stall ke paas khadey ek shaks se poochne par usne bataaya, 'pehle din utani bheed nahin aati he lekin is baar to ummid se kaaphi kam sugabugahat he
 Perhaps od-even may be affected
 ' vaise bhi lagbhag paune chah baje jab main pustak meley se nikal rahaa tha to adhiktar pravesh dwaar puri tarah se suune najar aae
 There was no one to come inside
 surakshakarmi khadey-khadey ukta rahe the or pustak premi puri tarah se nadaarad the
 It did not look good
 ravivaar ko od-ivan kaa chakkar bhi nahin he
 In such a situation, publishers have high expectations because without people there is no meaning of a book fair
 vaise bhi somvaar se kaamkaaji din shuru honge or od-ivan bhi lagu rahegaa
 So, this time, desolation can be more
 desh main anek rajya hai, kendra sarkaar he
 We have seen that through the GST, Cooperative Federalism in the country has given a new strength to Competitive Cooperative Federalism, a new result has been seen
 or GST jis prakaar se safal hua he, koti-koti maanav working hours uske peeche lage hai
 There is a miracle in technology, people of the world are surprised that the rollout of GST in such a big country in such a short time, in itself, how much power it has in India, to awaken a belief to every generation of the country
 It works for nai vyavasthaaen janm leti hai
 Today roads are being built at double speed, today railway tracks are being laid at double speed, today more than 14 thousand villages, which were lying in darkness even after independence, have been electrified and the country has been brightened We are seeing clearly moving towards 29 karod garibon ke jab Bank Accounts khulte hai, kisaanon ke nau karod se zyada Soil Health Card nikalate hai, dhaai karod se zyada garib maataaon-bahanon ko lakdi ke chuulhe se mukti milakar ke, gas kaa chulhaa miltaa he
 One of the impetus of the poor tribal is elevated
 garib vyakti mukhyadhara main judata he or desh pragati kii ore aage bad rahaa he
 The youth get approval of more than eight crore loan for self-guaranteed employment
 bank se milane vaale karj main byaaj daron main kami hoti he
 There is control over inflation
 madhyam varg kaa maanavy agar apana ghar bananaa chahta he to usko ghar banane ke liye kam byaaj dar se paise muhaiyaa karaae jate he
 Then by going to do something for the country, the country will move forward, with the belief that the common man of the country keeps connecting
 vakt badal chukaa he
 Today the government seems determined to do what it says
 chaahe hamane intervyuu khatm karne kii baat kii ho, chaahe hamane process ko khatm karne kii baat kii ho
 In the labor field alone, even the ordinary small businessman had to fill 50-60 forms, we have reduced it to just five forms
 kehane kaa taatpary yah he, main dher saare udhaaharan de saktaa hum, kehane kaa taatpary yah he ki Good Governance, Governance kii process ko simplify karnaa, us disha main bal dene kaa parinaam he ki aaj tej gati ai he, nirnyon main tej gati ai he
 And that's why 125 crore Indians are moving forward with this belief
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, aaj bharat kii saakh vishwa main bad rahi he
 Fight against terrorism, my countrymen you will be happy to know that today we are not alone in the fight against terrorism
 duniya ke kai desh hamen sakriy rup se madad kar rahe hai
 If hawala is traded, the world is giving us information
 aatankwaadiyon kii gatividhiyon ke sambandh main, vishwa hamen jaankariyaan de rahaa he
 We are fighting with the world against the terrorists
 main vishwa ke jo-jo desh, hamen is kaam main bhalee -bhaanti madad kar rahe hai, bharat kii saakh kaa gaurav badha rahe hai, main unka hriday se abhinandan karnaa chahta hum or yahi vaishvik hamaare sambandh bharat kii shanti evam suraksha main bhi ek nayaa aayam jod rahe hai, ek nayaa bal de rahe hai
 The development of Jammu and Kashmir, the progress of Jammu and Kashmir, the effort to fulfill the dreams of ordinary citizens of Jammu and Kashmir, along with the Government of Jammu and Kashmir, we also have the resolve of our countrymen
 phir se ek baar is swarg ko ham anubhav karen, us sthiti main laane ke liye ham patibaddh hai, ham katibaddh hai
 And that's why i want to say, whatever happens inside Kashmir, there is too much rhetoric, there are also a lot of attacks and attacks, everyone keeps on abusing each other
 lekin bhaaiyon bahanon, main saaf maanata hum ki kashmir main jo kuch bhi ghatnaayen ghatati hai, algaavvaadi, mutthibhar algaavvaadi, ye algaavvaadi jis prakaar ke naye-naye pantare rachate rahete hai, lekin us ladaai ko jeetne ke liye mere dimag main vishay saaf he
 'neither the problem is going to be solved by abuses, nor the problem is solved by the bullet, the problem will be solved by embracing every Kashmiri' and this one hundred and twenty crores countrymen have grown up from this tradition
 or isaliye ‘na gaali se na goli se, parivartan hoga gale lagaakar ke’ or us sankalp ko lekar ke ham aage bad rahe hai
 No softness will be taken against terrorism
 aatankwaadiyon ko baar - baar hamane kaha he ki aap mukhyadhara main aaiye bharat ke loktantr main aapako baat karne ke liye puraa adhikaar he, puri vyavastha he
 And it is the mainstream that can fill new energy in everyone's life
 or isaliye mujhe khushi he ki hamaare surakshabalon ke prayaason se kar ke left-wing Extremism ke ilaake main bahut badi sankhya main noujvaan waapas aae surrender kiye mukhyadhara main aane kii disha main unhone prayaas kiya
 Our soldiers are deployed to protect the border
 mujhe khushi he ki aaj bharat sarkaar ek aisi website launch kar rahi he, jo Gallantry Award vijeta he, hamaare desh ko gaurav dilaane vaale log hai, unki puri jaankariyon ke saath aaj ek Gallantry Award praapt karne waalon par aadhaarit ek Portal bhi prarambh kiya ja rahaa he, jisase desh kii nai peedi ko hamaare in vir balidaniyon ke bare main bahut sari jaankariyaan praapt ho sakati hai
 With the help of technology, we have made every effort to strengthen honesty in the country
 kaledhan ke khilaaf hamaari ladaai jari rahegi
 Our fight against corruption will continue
 or hamane dhire-dhire Technology ko intervene karte hue AADHAR kii vyavastha ko jodate hue, transparency laane kii disha main anek vidd-safal prayaas kiye hai or duniya ke anek log bharat ke is model kii charchaa bhi karte hai or uskaa adhyayan bhi karte hai
 Now, even a small person sitting in the government, thousands of kilometers away, can also supply his goods and supply his products to the government
 usko bade kii jarurat nahin he, bichauliye kii jarurat nahin he
 a portal named GEM has been created, GEM is doing government procurement by him
 bahut sari maatra main transparency laane main safalataa mili he
 Ladies & Gentlemen, the speed of government schemes has increased
 jab sarkaar, kisi kaam main vilamb ho jaataa he, to sirf wo project vilamb nahin hota
 It is not just a matter related to the expenditure of money
 jab koi bhi kaam atak jaataa he, ruuk jaataa he to sabase zyada nuksaan mere garib pariwaron ko hota he
 My brothers and sisters
 ham nau maheene ke bheetar-bheetar mangalayan pahunch sakate hai
 This is our strength
 nau maheene ke bheetar-bheetar yahaan se mangalayan pahunch sakate hai
 But once every month i keep an account of the work of the government
 ek baar aisi baat mere dhyaan main ai, 42 saal purana ek project, 70-72 kilometre kaa project, rail kaa 42 saal se atka padaa, lataka padaa tha
 Brothers and sisters, my country, which has the ability to reach Mangalyaan in nine months, cannot lay a rail track for 70-72 kilometers for 42 years, then the question arises in the mind of the poor that what will happen to my country? And we have focused on such things
 in chizon main badlaav laane ke liye hamane nai-nai technology geo-technology kaa vishay ho, space-technology kaa vishay ho in sari chizon ko jod karke hamane usamen parivartan laane kaa prayaas kiya he
 You must have seen a time when there was tension in the state and center for urea
 kerosene ke liye rajya or centre ke liye tanaav chalata tha
 There was an atmosphere like the center is the elder brother, the state is the younger brother
 hamane pehle din se jis disha main kaam kiya, kyonki lambe arase se mukhyamantri rahaa hum, isliye mujhe pataa he ki desh ke vikaas main rajyon kii kitni ahmiyat he
 i understand the importance of the Chief Ministers, how important the Governments of the States are, and therefore Co-operative Federalism and now Competitive Co-operative Federalism we have emphasized that and you must have seen that today all the decisions together , We are doing it together
 aapako yaad hoga isi lalakile kii pracheer se ek baar desh ke rajyo kii bijli companiyon kii durdasha kii charchaa ek pradhanmantri ne kii thi
 Had to worry about the Red Fort
 aaj hamane rajyon ko saath le kar ke ‘udai yojana’ ke dwaara rajyon ko takat de karke us bijli ke kaarkaanon ke kaarobaar main yah samasyaayein thi, uskaa samaadhaan kaa kaam mil karke kiya, yah Federalism kaa ek bahut bada saboot he
 Along with the GST, whether it is about the construction of Smart City, whether it is a campaign for cleanliness, whether it is a discussion of toilet, ease of doing business, all these subjects are such that all the states of our country join shoulder to shoulder
 Today, the Government of India is being very successful in running shoulder to shoulder with the state
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyon ‘new India’ hamaari sabase badi takat he, loktantr he
 But we know that we have limited democracy to the ballot paper
 loktantr mat-patr tak simit nahin ho saktaa
 And that is why we want to emphasize on democracy in 'new India' in which the system is not public, but the people should have the system, so that democracy should become the identity of 'new India', we want to go in that direction
 lokmaanya tilak ji ne kaha tha, ‘swarajya meraa janmasiddh adhikaar he’
 The mantra of all of us in independent India should be, 'state is my rightful birth'
 ‘surajya’ ham sabakaa daayitv hona chahie
 Citizens should carry out their responsibilities, governments should fulfill their responsibilities
 ‘swarajya se surajya’ kii ore jab chalanaa he, to deshvasi peeche nahin rahete
 When i asked to give up the gas subsidy, the country came forward
 swatchta kii baat kahi, aaj bhi hindustan ke har kone main koi na koi swatchta ke abhiyaan ko aage badha rahaa he
 When it came to demonetisation, the world was surprised, even people were saying, now Modi has gone
 lekin notebandi main sava sau karod deshavaasiyon ne jis dhairya ko dikhaaya, jis vishwaas ko bataaya or usee kaa parinaam he ki aaj bhrashtachar ke khilaaf nakel lagane main ham ek ke baad kadam uthaane main safal ho rahe hai
 This new tradition of public participation for our country
 
 
 janabhagidaari se hi desh ko aage badhaane main hamaara prayaas he
 My dear countrymen, Lal Bahadur Shastri gave the mantra of Jai Jawan Jai Kisan
 hamaare desh ke kisaan ne peeche mud ke kabhi dekha nahin, record fasal utpaadan aaj hamaara kisaan karke de rahaa he
 In the midst of natural disasters, he is getting new achievements
 daal kaa record utpaadan hua he or mere pyaare bhaiyo bahanon, mere kisaan bhaiyo bahanon, hindustan main kabhi bhi sarkaar main daal kharidne kii parampara hi nahin rahi he or kabhi ek-aadh baar kiya ho to hajaaron main hi hajaaron ton ke hisaab ke hisaab se hota tha, is baar jab mere desh ke kisaanon ne daal utpaadan karke garib ko paushtik aahaar dene kaa kaam kiya, to 16 lakh ton daal, sarkaar ne kharidne kaa aitihaasik kaam karke is kaam ko badhaava diya
 Prime Minister Crop Insurance Scheme, a security shield has been provided to my farmer brothers
 teen saal pehle sirf sava teen karod kisaan is pradhanmantri fasal beemaa yojana, jo pehle duusare naam se chalati thi uskaa laabh lete the
 Today, in such a short time under the Prime Minister Crop Insurance Scheme, many new farmers have joined with it and almost these numbers have reached a further six crores
 pradhanmantri krishi sinchai yojana, kisaan ko agar pani mili to mitti main se sona paidaa karne kii takat rakhata he or isliye kisaan ko pani pahunchane ke liye maine pichhali baar lalakile se kaha tha, un yojaanaaon main se 21 yojana ham purna kar chuke hai or baaki 50 yojanaayen aane vaale kuch samay main purna ho jaaengi
 And i have resolved a total of 99 schemes
 2019 ke pehle un 99 badi-bady yojanaayen ko paripurna karke, kisaan ke khet tak pani pahunchane kaa kaam ham purna kar denge
 And we cannot change the fate of our farmer till we provide for the farmer from seed to market
 or isliye uske liye infrastructure chahie, uske liye supply-chain chahie
 Every year our vegetables, our fruits, our crops worth millions and billions are wasted and so to change that, one has encouraged Foreign Direct Investment so that the world can join us in food processing
 Infrastructure banane ke liye badhaava diya or bharat sarkaar ne ‘pradhanmantri kisaan sampada yojana’ lagu kii he
 Due to which arrangements will be made that will hand-hold the farmer from seed to market, develop systems and we will be successful in bringing a new change in the lives of our crores of farmers
 Demand or Technology ke kaaran, hamaare desh main nature of job main bhi bahut bada badlaav aa rahaa he
 In employment related schemes, according to the requirements of 21st century in the way of training, the Government of India has taken up many new schemes for the development of human resources
 naujavaanon ko bina guarantee bainkon se paisa mili iske liye bahut bada abhiyaan chalaaya he
 Our youth should stand on their feet, they should get employment, become employable, and in the last three years we have seen that due to 'pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana', crores of youth have stood on their feet
 itnaa hi nahin, ek noujvaan ek yaa do teen or logon ko bhi rojgaar de rahaa he
 To create World Class Universities in the field of education, we have taken a major step to break free from bondage
 20 uniwarsitiyon kaa aahvaan kiya he ki aap apane bhagya kaa faisla kiijie, sarkaar kahin bich main nahin aegi
 From above the government is also ready to help up to 1000 crores rupees
 aahvaan kiya he, mujhe vishwaas he mere desh kii shiksha sansthaaon main jarur aage aaenge, isko safal karenge
 In the last three years, 6 iits, 7 new iims, 8 new iiits have been built, and we have also done this work to link education with job opportunities
 meri maatayen, bahanen aaj bahut badi maatra main, parivaar main mahilaayein bhi rojgaar ke liye jaati hai
 And so at night, they get employment opportunities, work in factories, so have taken a very important step to change Labor Laws
 hamaari maatayen, bahanen parivaar kii bhi ek ahm ikai hai
 The contribution of our mothers and sisters is huge to build our future, and so Maternity Leave, which was 12 weeks, will continue to have income in 26 weeks, thus giving has worked
 main aaj hamaari mahilaon ke shashaktikaran ke kaam ke sambandh main, main khaas karke, main un bahanon kaa abhinandan karnaa chahta hum jo teen talaak ke kaaran bahut hi durdavy jindagi jeene ke liye majaboor hui hai
 There is no shelter left, and such afflicted, triple-divorced sisters have started a movement across the country
 desh ke buddhijivi varg ko hilaa diya, desh ke media ne bhi unki madad kii, puure desh main teen-talaak ke khilaaf ek maahaul nirmaan hua
 i heartily congratulate my sisters who are fighting this movement against the triple talaq, and i am sure that in helping them in their fight for the empowerment of mothers and sisters, Will do
 hindustan puri madad karegaa or Women Empowerment ke is mahatvapurn kadam main wo safal hoke rahegi; aisa mujhe puraa bharosa he
 My dear countrymen, sometimes in the name of faith, in the absence of patience some people do such things, which spoil the fabric of society
 desh shanti, sadbhaavna or ekta se chalata he
 The poison of casteism, the poison of communalism, can never benefit the country
 ye to gandhi kii bhoomi he, buddha kii bhoomi he, sabko saath le karke chalanaa; ye is desh kii samskruti or parampara kaa hissaa he
 We have to carry it forward successfully, and hence violence cannot be stressed in the name of faith
 aspataal main to patient ke saath kuch ho jaae, aspataal jala diya jaae; aksmaat ho jaae, gaadiyaan jala diya jaaen; andolan karen, sarkari sampatti ko jala diya jaae; aaazaad hindustan ke liye ye kiskaa he? hamaare sava sau karod deshavaasiyon kii sampatti he
 Whose cultural heritage is this? This is the cultural heritage of 1
25 billion countrymen
 ye aasthaa kiski he? ham sava sau karod deshavaasiyon kii aasthaa he; or isliye aasthaa ke naam par hinsa kaa rasta, is desh main kabhi bhi chal nahin saktaa, yah desh kabhi sweekaar nahin kar saktaa he
 And so i will urge the countrymen, at that time there was the slogan 'quit India', today the slogan is 'add India'
 vyakti-vyakti ko hamane saath lenaa he, jan-jan ko saath lenaa he, samaaj ke har tabake ko saath lenaa he, or usee ko le karke hamen desh ko aage badhanaa he
 We need a strong economy to build a prosperous India
 santulit vikaas chahie, next generation infrastructure chahie, tab ja kar ke hamaare sapanom ke bharat ko ham apni ankhon ke saamne dekh sakate hai
 Brothers and sisters, we have taken countless decisions in three years
 kuch chizon ko notice kiya gaya he or kuch chijen shaayad notice main nahin ai
 But one thing is important
 jab aap itnaa bada badlaav karte he to rukvaaten aati hai, gati ruk jaati he
 But see the working style of this government, if the train also passes near a railway station, when the track changes, the speed running from 60 has to be brought to the speed of 30
 trek badalane par train kii speed kam ho jaati he
 We are trying to take the whole country to a new track, but we have not let his speed down, we have kept his pace
 chaahe GST laaen ho, koi bhi kanoon laaen ho, koi bhi nai vyavastha laae ho, ham usko karne main safal hue he or aage bhi isko ham karenge
 We have laid emphasis on infrastructure
 abhootpurv kharch infrastructure par die ja rahe hai
 The railway station should be modernized, in a small town, whether to build an airport, whether to arrange water-way, whether to arrange roadways, whether to build gas grid, whether to grid water, whether to do optical fiber network , We are giving full emphasis on all types of modern infrastructure
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, 21veen sadi main bharat ko aage badhaane kaa sabase urjavan kshetra he, hamaara purvi hindustan
 There is so much potential, powerful human resource, immense natural wealth, rich of hard work, and ability to change life by resolving
 hamaara puraa dhyaan purvi uttar pradesh, bihar, bengal, assam, north east, odisha, ye hamaare aise samarthyavan rajya hai, jahaan prakritik sampada bharpoor he, usko aage badhaakar ke desh ko ek nai oonchai par le jane kii disha main ham prayatnrat he
 Brothers and sisters, corruption-free India is a very important task, we are trying to strengthen it
 sarkaar banane ke baad pehla kaam kiya tha SIT banane kaa
 Today, after three years, i want to tell the countrymen, proudly tell them that within three years, we have discovered more than about 1
25 lakh crore rupees of black money, caught it and suurender it
 Is forced
 uske baad hamane notebandi kaa faisla kiya
 We have achieved many significant successes through demonetisation
 jo kalaadhan chipa hua tha, usko mukhyadhara main aana padaa
 You must have seen that we sometimes used to extend 07 days-10 days-15 days, sometimes at the petrol pump, sometimes at the drugstore, sometimes at the railway station, we continued to take old notes, because our effort was once Money should also become a part of the formal economy in the banks and we have successfully completed that work
 or iskaa kaaran yah hua he ki abhi jo research hua he, kareeb teen lakh karod rupye
 
 
 This government has not done research, outside experts have done it
 notebandi ke baad teen lakh karod rupye, jo atirikt, jo kabhi banking system main waapas nahin aata tha wo aayaa he
 More than a quarter of a million rupees in the amount deposited in banks is under suspicion
 kam se kam do lakh karod rupye se zyada kalaadhan usko bainko tak pahunchnaa padaa he or ab vyavastha ke saath unako apana jawaab dene ke liye majaboor hue hai
 The new black money has also come to a great halt
 is varsh, iskaa parinaam dekhie, 01 april se 05 agast tak income tax return daakhil karne vaale nae vyaktigat karadaataaon kii sankhya 56 lakh
 In the same period last year, this number was only 2
2 million
 Double se bhi zyada! ye kaaran kaledhan ke khilaaf hamaari ladaai kaa parinaam he
 More than 18 lakh people have been identified, whose income is more than the book according to them, they are uncountable and hence they have to answer this difference
 saadhe chaar lakh log isamen se ab maidan main aaye hai, apni galati sweekaar karke raste main aane kaa prayaas kar rahe hai
 One lakh people have come forward, who had never heard of income tax in life, nor had ever given income tax, nor had they thought of it, but today they have to do it
 bhaaiyon bahanon, hamaare desh main agar do chaar companiyaan bhi kahin band ho jaae, to choubison ghante us par charchaaen hoti hai us par Debates hoti hai
 Economy is over


 it is done, no matter what happens! You'd be surprised to know, black money traders, Shell used to run companies and after demonetisation when data-mining was done
 tab teen lakh aisi companiyaan pai gayi hai, jo sirf or sirf shell companiyaan hai
 Does hawala business
 teen lakh, koi kalpana kar saktaa he
 And we have canceled the registration of one and a half lakh from that
 paanch companiyaan band ho jaae to hindustan main tufaan much jaataa he
 Locked up to twenty two lakh companies
 desh kaa maal luutane waalon ko jawaab dena padegaa, ye kaam hamane kar ke dikhaaya
 You will be surprised! Some shell companies are such that four hundred and four hundred companies were running at the same address, brothers and sisters
 chaar sau chaar sau companiyaan chal rahi thim
 Nobody was going to see, nobody was going to ask
 sari mileebhagat chal rahi thi
 And so my brothers and sisters, i have waged a very big fight against corruption black money
 desh kii bhalaai ke liye desh ke garibon ke kalyaan ke liye, desh ke naujavaanon ke bhavishya ko banane ke liye
 Brothers and sisters, one step after the other, and i am sure it will increase further after GST
 or Transparency aane vaali he
 Transportation alone Our truck used to go from one place to another
 ye GST ke baad tees pratishat uskaa samay batch gaya he
 Thousands of crores of rupees have been saved due to the end of check-post
 sabase badi bachat samay kii hui he
 In a way, its thirty percent efficiency is increasing
 aap kalpana kar sakate hai hindustan ke Transport jagat main tees pratishat Efficiency badhane kaa matlab kya hota he
 a GST has brought about such a big change
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, aaj notebandi ke kaaran bainko ke paas dhan aayaa he
 Banks are reducing their interest rate
 mudra ke dwaara saamaanya maanav ko bank se paisa mil rahaa he
 The common man is getting an opportunity to stand on his feet
 garib ho, madhyavarg kaa vyakti ho ghar bananaa chahta he, to bank usko madad karne ke liye aage aa rahe hai, kam byaaj kii dar se aage aa rahe hai
 It is working towards accelerating the economy of the country
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, ab ye vakt badal chukaa he
 We are in the 21st century
 vishwa kaa sabase bada yuva varg hamaare desh main he
 Our identity in the world is by IT, by Digital World
 kya ab bhi ham usee pooraani soch main rahenge
 Hey! Once upon a time, leather coins used to move, slowly disappeared, no one was asking
 aaj jo kaagaj ke note hai, samay aate rahete wo sara kaa sara Digital Currency main Convert hone vaala he
 Let us lead, let us take responsibility, let us go towards Digital Transaction
 ham BHIM APP ko apanaaen, aarthik kaarobaar kaa hissaa banaaen
 We also work through Prepaid
 or mujhe khushi he ki Digital lenden badi he
 It has increased by 34 percent over the previous year and about 44 percent in prepaid payments
 or isaliye kam cash vaali arthvyavastha, usko lekar ke hamen aage badhanaa chahie
 My dear countrymen, there are some schemes of the government that can save money in the pockets of the common man of India
 agar aap LED Bulb lagaate hai, to saal bhar kaa hajaar do hajaar paanch hajaar rupaya aapkaa bachane vaala he
 If you succeed in a clean India, then the poor's medicine of seven thousand rupees stops
 mahangaai par niyantran, aapke badhate hue kharch ko rokane main safal hua he, ek prakaar se aapaki bachat he
 Affordable medicine shops have become a huge blessing for the poor through 'jan Aushadhi Kendras'
 hamaare yahaan Operation ke peeche, stent ke peeche jo kharch hote the wo kam hue hai
 In the coming days, all facilities will also be available for Knee's operation
 hamaari koshish he ki garib or madhyamvarg ke maanav ke liye ye kharch kam ho or uske liye ham ek ke baad ek kadam uthaa rahe hai
 Earlier, dialysis used to take place in the headquarters of the states in our country
 hamane tay kiya hindustan ke jila kendron tak Dialysis pahunchaayenge
 Nearly three and a half hundred and four hundred districts have been reached and by dialysis for free, we are working to save the life of the poor
 aaj desh garv kar saktaa he ki hamane vishwa ke saamne apni vyavasthaaon ko viksit kiya he
 Today we have succeeded in arranging NAVIC Navigation through GPS System
 hamane SAARC Satellite ke dwaara hamane padosi deshon ke saath madad karne kaa safal abhiyaan kiya he
 We are delivering our importance inside the world today by 'tejas' airplane
 ‘BHIM-AADHAR App’ duniya ke andar Digital Transaction ke liye ek ajooba bana hua he
 rupay Card
 
 
 hindustan main rupay Card karodon kii taadaad main he
 And if it becomes operational, if it is in the pocket of the poor, then it will become the largest in the world
 or isaliye mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, meraa aapse yahi aagrah he ki ham ‘new India’ kaa sankalp le kar ke aage badhen, samay rahete hue karen
 It is said in our scriptures: Aniyat Kaal: Aniyat Kaal: Prabhutyo Viplavante, Prabhutayo Viplavante
 sahi samay par agar koi kaary puraa nahin kiya gaya, to phir icchit parinaam kabhi nahin milte hai
 And so for 'team India', for Team India of 1
25 billion countrymen, today we have to pledge to make 'new India' by 2022 and we will do this work ourselves, no one will do it, we will do it ourselves
 desh ke liye karenge, pehle se acha karenge, pehle se zyada karenge, samarpan bhav se karenge, 2022 main ‘bhavy-divya’ hindustan dekhne ke liye karenge
 And that's why we will all together create an India where the poor have a pucca house, electricity, water
 ham sab milakar ek aisa bharat banaaenge, jahaan desh kaa kisaan chintaa main nahin chaiyn se soyega
 By 2022, he will earn twice as much as he is earning today
 ham sab milakar ke ek aisa hindustan banaaenge, jahaan yuvaaon, mahilaon ko apane sapane puure karne ke liye bharpoor avasar uplabdh honge
 Together we will create an India that will be free from terrorism, communalism and casteism
 ham sab milakar ke ek aisa bharat banaaenge, jahaan bhrashtachar or bhai-bhatijawad se koi samjhauta nahin hoga
 Together we will create an India that will be clean, healthy and fulfill the dream of Swaraj
 or isaliye mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, ham sab milakar ke vikaas kii is daud main aage chalane kaa prayaas karenge
 Today, after 70 years of independence, in the important tenure of five years between 75 years of waiting for independence, all of us countrymen should go with the dream of a 'divine-grand India', with this same sentiment, i once again got freedom
 i bow to the lovers of sava sau karod deshavaasiyon ke nae vishwaas, nai umang ko naman karata hum
 And call upon 'team India' to move forward with a new resolution
 isi bhaavana ke saath aap sabko hriday se meri bahut bahut shubhakamanaayen

 Then by going to do something for the country, the country will move forward, with the belief that the common man of the country keeps connecting
 vakt badal chukaa he
 Today the government seems determined to do what it says
 chaahe hamane intervyuu khatm karne kii baat kii ho, chaahe hamane process ko khatm karne kii baat kii ho
 In the labor field alone, even the ordinary small businessman had to fill 50-60 forms, we have reduced it to just five forms

 phir se ek baar is swarg ko ham anubhav karen, us sthiti main laane ke liye ham patibaddh hai, ham katibaddh hai
 And that's why i want to say, whatever happens inside Kashmir, there is too much rhetoric, there are also a lot of attacks and attacks, everyone keeps on abusing each other
 lekin bhaaiyon bahanon, main saaf maanata hum ki kashmir main jo kuch bhi ghatnaayen ghatati hai, algaavvaadi, mutthibhar algaavvaadi, ye algaavvaadi jis prakaar ke naye-naye pantare rachate rahete hai, lekin us ladaai ko jeetne ke liye mere dimag main vishay saaf he
 'neither the problem is going to be solved by abuses, nor the problem is solved by the bullet, the problem will be solved by embracing every Kashmiri' and this one hundred and twenty crores countrymen have grown up from this tradition
 or isaliye ‘na gaali se na goli se, parivartan hoga gale lagaakar ke’ or us sankalp ko lekar ke ham aage bad rahe hai
 No softness will be taken against terrorism
 aatankwaadiyon ko baar - baar hamane kaha he ki aap mukhyadhara main aaiye bharat ke loktantr main aapako baat karne ke liye puraa adhikaar he, puri vyavastha he
 And it is the mainstream that can fill new energy in everyone's life
 or isaliye mujhe khushi he ki hamaare surakshabalon ke prayaason se kar ke left-wing Extremism ke ilaake main bahut badi sankhya main noujvaan waapas aae surrender kiye mukhyadhara main aane kii disha main unhone prayaas kiya
 Our soldiers are deployed to protect the border
 mujhe khushi he ki aaj bharat sarkaar ek aisi website launch kar rahi he, jo Gallantry Award vijeta he, hamaare desh ko gaurav dilaane vaale log hai, unki puri jaankariyon ke saath aaj ek Gallantry Award praapt karne waalon par aadhaarit ek Portal bhi prarambh kiya ja rahaa he, jisase desh kii nai peedi ko hamaare in vir balidaniyon ke bare main bahut sari jaankariyaan praapt ho sakati hai
 With the help of technology, we have made every effort to strengthen honesty in the country
 kaledhan ke khilaaf hamaari ladaai jari rahegi
 Our fight against corruption will continue
 or hamane dhire-dhire Technology ko intervene karte hue AADHAR kii vyavastha ko jodate hue, transparency laane kii disha main anek vidd-safal prayaas kiye hai or duniya ke anek log bharat ke is model kii charchaa bhi karte hai or uskaa adhyayan bhi karte hai
 Now, even a small person sitting in the government, thousands of kilometers away, can also supply his goods and supply his products to the government
 usko bade kii jarurat nahin he, bichauliye kii jarurat nahin he
 a portal named GEM has been created, GEM is doing government procurement by him
 bahut sari maatra main transparency laane main safalataa mili he
 Ladies & Gentlemen, the speed of government schemes has increased
 jab sarkaar, kisi kaam main vilamb ho jaataa he, to sirf wo project vilamb nahin hota
 It is not just a matter related to the expenditure of money
 jab koi bhi kaam atak jaataa he, ruuk jaataa he to sabase zyada nuksaan mere garib pariwaron ko hota he
 My brothers and sisters
 ham nau maheene ke bheetar-bheetar mangalayan pahunch sakate hai
 This is our strength
 nau maheene ke bheetar-bheetar yahaan se mangalayan pahunch sakate hai
 But once every month i keep an account of the work of the government
 ek baar aisi baat mere dhyaan main ai, 42 saal purana ek project, 70-72 kilometre kaa project, rail kaa 42 saal se atka padaa, lataka padaa tha
 Brothers and sisters, my country, which has the ability to reach Mangalyaan in nine months, cannot lay a rail track for 70-72 kilometers for 42 years, then the question arises in the mind of the poor that what will happen to my country? And we have focused on such things
 in chizon main badlaav laane ke liye hamane nai-nai technology geo-technology kaa vishay ho, space-technology kaa vishay ho in sari chizon ko jod karke hamane usamen parivartan laane kaa prayaas kiya he
 You must have seen a time when there was tension in the state and center for urea
 kerosene ke liye rajya or centre ke liye tanaav chalata tha
 There was an atmosphere like the center is the elder brother, the state is the younger brother
 hamane pehle din se jis disha main kaam kiya, kyonki lambe arase se mukhyamantri rahaa hum, isliye mujhe pataa he ki desh ke vikaas main rajyon kii kitni ahmiyat he
 i understand the importance of the Chief Ministers, how important the Governments of the States are, and therefore Co-operative Federalism and now Competitive Co-operative Federalism we have emphasized that and you must have seen that today all the decisions together , We are doing it together
 aapako yaad hoga isi lalakile kii pracheer se ek baar desh ke rajyo kii bijli companiyon kii durdasha kii charchaa ek pradhanmantri ne kii thi
 Had to worry about the Red Fort

 Along with the GST, whether it is about the construction of Smart City, whether it is a campaign for cleanliness, whether it is a discussion of toilet, ease of doing business, all these subjects are such that all the states of our country join shoulder to shoulder
 Today, the Government of India is being very successful in running shoulder to shoulder with the state
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyon ‘new India’ hamaari sabase badi takat he, loktantr he
 But we know that we have limited democracy to the ballot paper
 loktantr mat-patr tak simit nahin ho saktaa
 And that is why we want to emphasize on democracy in 'new India' in which the system is not public, but the people should have the system, so that democracy should become the identity of 'new India', we want to go in that direction
 lokmaanya tilak ji ne kaha tha, ‘swarajya meraa janmasiddh adhikaar he’
 The mantra of all of us in independent India should be, 'state is my rightful birth'
 ‘surajya’ ham sabakaa daayitv hona chahie
 Citizens should carry out their responsibilities, governments should fulfill their responsibilities
 ‘swarajya se surajya’ kii ore jab chalanaa he, to deshvasi peeche nahin rahete
 When i asked to give up the gas subsidy, the country came forward

 When it came to demonetisation, the world was surprised, even people were saying, now Modi has gone
 lekin notebandi main sava sau karod deshavaasiyon ne jis dhairya ko dikhaaya, jis vishwaas ko bataaya or usee kaa parinaam he ki aaj bhrashtachar ke khilaaf nakel lagane main ham ek ke baad kadam uthaane main safal ho rahe hai
 This new tradition of public participation for our country
 
 
 janabhagidaari se hi desh ko aage badhaane main hamaara prayaas he
 My dear countrymen, Lal Bahadur Shastri gave the mantra of Jai Jawan Jai Kisan
 hamaare desh ke kisaan ne peeche mud ke kabhi dekha nahin, record fasal utpaadan aaj hamaara kisaan karke de rahaa he
 In the midst of natural disasters, he is getting new achievements
 daal kaa record utpaadan hua he or mere pyaare bhaiyo bahanon, mere kisaan bhaiyo bahanon, hindustan main kabhi bhi sarkaar main daal kharidne kii parampara hi nahin rahi he or kabhi ek-aadh baar kiya ho to hajaaron main hi hajaaron ton ke hisaab ke hisaab se hota tha, is baar jab mere desh ke kisaanon ne daal utpaadan karke garib ko paushtik aahaar dene kaa kaam kiya, to 16 lakh ton daal, sarkaar ne kharidne kaa aitihaasik kaam karke is kaam ko badhaava diya
 Prime Minister Crop Insurance Scheme, a security shield has been provided to my farmer brothers
 teen saal pehle sirf sava teen karod kisaan is pradhanmantri fasal beemaa yojana, jo pehle duusare naam se chalati thi uskaa laabh lete the
 Today, in such a short time under the Prime Minister Crop Insurance Scheme, many new farmers have joined with it and almost these numbers have reached a further six crores
 pradhanmantri krishi sinchai yojana, kisaan ko agar pani mili to mitti main se sona paidaa karne kii takat rakhata he or isliye kisaan ko pani pahunchane ke liye maine pichhali baar lalakile se kaha tha, un yojaanaaon main se 21 yojana ham purna kar chuke hai or baaki 50 yojanaayen aane vaale kuch samay main purna ho jaaengi
 And i have resolved a total of 99 schemes
 2019 ke pehle un 99 badi-bady yojanaayen ko paripurna karke, kisaan ke khet tak pani pahunchane kaa kaam ham purna kar denge
 And we cannot change the fate of our farmer till we provide for the farmer from seed to market
 or isliye uske liye infrastructure chahie, uske liye supply-chain chahie
 Every year our vegetables, our fruits, our crops worth millions and billions are wasted and so to change that, one has encouraged Foreign Direct Investment so that the world can join us in food processing
 Infrastructure banane ke liye badhaava diya or bharat sarkaar ne ‘pradhanmantri kisaan sampada yojana’ lagu kii he
 Due to which arrangements will be made that will hand-hold the farmer from seed to market, develop systems and we will be successful in bringing a new change in the lives of our crores of farmers
 Demand or Technology ke kaaran, hamaare desh main nature of job main bhi bahut bada badlaav aa rahaa he
 In employment related schemes, according to the requirements of 21st century in the way of training, the Government of India has taken up many new schemes for the development of human resources

 itnaa hi nahin, ek noujvaan ek yaa do teen or logon ko bhi rojgaar de rahaa he
 To create World Class Universities in the field of education, we have taken a major step to break free from bondage
 20 uniwarsitiyon kaa aahvaan kiya he ki aap apane bhagya kaa faisla kiijie, sarkaar kahin bich main nahin aegi
 From above the government is also ready to help up to 1000 crores rupees
 aahvaan kiya he, mujhe vishwaas he mere desh kii shiksha sansthaaon main jarur aage aaenge, isko safal karenge
 In the last three years, 6 iits, 7 new iims, 8 new iiits have been built, and we have also done this work to link education with job opportunities
 meri maatayen, bahanen aaj bahut badi maatra main, parivaar main mahilaayein bhi rojgaar ke liye jaati hai
 And so at night, they get employment opportunities, work in factories, so have taken a very important step to change Labor Laws
 hamaari maatayen, bahanen parivaar kii bhi ek ahm ikai hai
 The contribution of our mothers and sisters is huge to build our future, and so Maternity Leave, which was 12 weeks, will continue to have income in 26 weeks, thus giving has worked
 main aaj hamaari mahilaon ke shashaktikaran ke kaam ke sambandh main, main khaas karke, main un bahanon kaa abhinandan karnaa chahta hum jo teen talaak ke kaaran bahut hi durdavy jindagi jeene ke liye majaboor hui hai
 There is no shelter left, and such afflicted, triple-divorced sisters have started a movement across the country
 desh ke buddhijivi varg ko hilaa diya, desh ke media ne bhi unki madad kii, puure desh main teen-talaak ke khilaaf ek maahaul nirmaan hua
 i heartily congratulate my sisters who are fighting this movement against the triple talaq, and i am sure that in helping them in their fight for the empowerment of mothers and sisters, Will do
 hindustan puri madad karegaa or Women Empowerment ke is mahatvapurn kadam main wo safal hoke rahegi; aisa mujhe puraa bharosa he
 My dear countrymen, sometimes in the name of faith, in the absence of patience some people do such things, which spoil the fabric of society
 desh shanti, sadbhaavna or ekta se chalata he
 The poison of casteism, the poison of communalism, can never benefit the country
 ye to gandhi kii bhoomi he, buddha kii bhoomi he, sabko saath le karke chalanaa; ye is desh kii samskruti or parampara kaa hissaa he
 We have to carry it forward successfully, and hence violence cannot be stressed in the name of faith
 aspataal main to patient ke saath kuch ho jaae, aspataal jala diya jaae; aksmaat ho jaae, gaadiyaan jala diya jaaen; andolan karen, sarkari sampatti ko jala diya jaae; aaazaad hindustan ke liye ye kiskaa he? hamaare sava sau karod deshavaasiyon kii sampatti he
 Whose cultural heritage is this? This is the cultural heritage of 1
25 billion countrymen
 ye aasthaa kiski he? ham sava sau karod deshavaasiyon kii aasthaa he; or isliye aasthaa ke naam par hinsa kaa rasta, is desh main kabhi bhi chal nahin saktaa, yah desh kabhi sweekaar nahin kar saktaa he
 And so i will urge the countrymen, at that time there was the slogan 'quit India', today the slogan is 'add India'
 vyakti-vyakti ko hamane saath lenaa he, jan-jan ko saath lenaa he, samaaj ke har tabake ko saath lenaa he, or usee ko le karke hamen desh ko aage badhanaa he
 We need a strong economy to build a prosperous India
 santulit vikaas chahie, next generation infrastructure chahie, tab ja kar ke hamaare sapanom ke bharat ko ham apni ankhon ke saamne dekh sakate hai
 Brothers and sisters, we have taken countless decisions in three years
 kuch chizon ko notice kiya gaya he or kuch chijen shaayad notice main nahin ai
 But one thing is important
 jab aap itnaa bada badlaav karte he to rukvaaten aati hai, gati ruk jaati he
 But see the working style of this government, if the train also passes near a railway station, when the track changes, the speed running from 60 has to be brought to the speed of 30
 trek badalane par train kii speed kam ho jaati he
 We are trying to take the whole country to a new track, but we have not let his speed down, we have kept his pace
 chaahe GST laaen ho, koi bhi kanoon laaen ho, koi bhi nai vyavastha laae ho, ham usko karne main safal hue he or aage bhi isko ham karenge
 We have laid emphasis on infrastructure
 abhootpurv kharch infrastructure par die ja rahe hai
 The railway station should be modernized, in a small town, whether to build an airport, whether to arrange water-way, whether to arrange roadways, whether to build gas grid, whether to grid water, whether to do optical fiber network , We are giving full emphasis on all types of modern infrastructure
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, 21veen sadi main bharat ko aage badhaane kaa sabase urjavan kshetra he, hamaara purvi hindustan
 There is so much potential, powerful human resource, immense natural wealth, rich of hard work, and ability to change life by resolving
 hamaara puraa dhyaan purvi uttar pradesh, bihar, bengal, assam, north east, odisha, ye hamaare aise samarthyavan rajya hai, jahaan prakritik sampada bharpoor he, usko aage badhaakar ke desh ko ek nai oonchai par le jane kii disha main ham prayatnrat he
 Brothers and sisters, corruption-free India is a very important task, we are trying to strengthen it
 sarkaar banane ke baad pehla kaam kiya tha SIT banane kaa
 Today, after three years, i want to tell the countrymen, proudly tell them that within three years, we have discovered more than about 1
25 lakh crore rupees of black money, caught it and suurender it
 Is forced
 uske baad hamane notebandi kaa faisla kiya
 We have achieved many significant successes through demonetisation
 jo kalaadhan chipa hua tha, usko mukhyadhara main aana padaa
 You must have seen that we sometimes used to extend 07 days-10 days-15 days, sometimes at the petrol pump, sometimes at the drugstore, sometimes at the railway station, we continued to take old notes, because our effort was once Money should also become a part of the formal economy in the banks and we have successfully completed that work
 or iskaa kaaran yah hua he ki abhi jo research hua he, kareeb teen lakh karod rupye
 
 
 This government has not done research, outside experts have done it
 notebandi ke baad teen lakh karod rupye, jo atirikt, jo kabhi banking system main waapas nahin aata tha wo aayaa he
 More than a quarter of a million rupees in the amount deposited in banks is under suspicion
 kam se kam do lakh karod rupye se zyada kalaadhan usko bainko tak pahunchnaa padaa he or ab vyavastha ke saath unako apana jawaab dene ke liye majaboor hue hai
 The new black money has also come to a great halt
 is varsh, iskaa parinaam dekhie, 01 april se 05 agast tak income tax return daakhil karne vaale nae vyaktigat karadaataaon kii sankhya 56 lakh
 In the same period last year, this number was only 2
2 million
 Double se bhi zyada! ye kaaran kaledhan ke khilaaf hamaari ladaai kaa parinaam he
 More than 18 lakh people have been identified, whose income is more than the book according to them, they are uncountable and hence they have to answer this difference
 saadhe chaar lakh log isamen se ab maidan main aaye hai, apni galati sweekaar karke raste main aane kaa prayaas kar rahe hai
 One lakh people have come forward, who had never heard of income tax in life, nor had ever given income tax, nor had they thought of it, but today they have to do it
 bhaaiyon bahanon, hamaare desh main agar do chaar companiyaan bhi kahin band ho jaae, to choubison ghante us par charchaaen hoti hai us par Debates hoti hai
 Economy is over


 it is done, no matter what happens! You'd be surprised to know, black money traders, Shell used to run companies and after demonetisation when data-mining was done
 tab teen lakh aisi companiyaan pai gayi hai, jo sirf or sirf shell companiyaan hai
 Does hawala business
 teen lakh, koi kalpana kar saktaa he
 And we have canceled the registration of one and a half lakh from that
 paanch companiyaan band ho jaae to hindustan main tufaan much jaataa he
 Locked up to twenty two lakh companies
 desh kaa maal luutane waalon ko jawaab dena padegaa, ye kaam hamane kar ke dikhaaya
 You will be surprised! Some shell companies are such that four hundred and four hundred companies were running at the same address, brothers and sisters
 chaar sau chaar sau companiyaan chal rahi thim
 Nobody was going to see, nobody was going to ask
 sari mileebhagat chal rahi thi
 And so my brothers and sisters, i have waged a very big fight against corruption black money
 desh kii bhalaai ke liye desh ke garibon ke kalyaan ke liye, desh ke naujavaanon ke bhavishya ko banane ke liye
 Brothers and sisters, one step after the other, and i am sure it will increase further after GST
 or Transparency aane vaali he
 Transportation alone Our truck used to go from one place to another
 ye GST ke baad tees pratishat uskaa samay batch gaya he
 Thousands of crores of rupees have been saved due to the end of check-post
 sabase badi bachat samay kii hui he
 In a way, its thirty percent efficiency is increasing
 aap kalpana kar sakate hai hindustan ke Transport jagat main tees pratishat Efficiency badhane kaa matlab kya hota he
 a GST has brought about such a big change
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, aaj notebandi ke kaaran bainko ke paas dhan aayaa he
 Banks are reducing their interest rate
 mudra ke dwaara saamaanya maanav ko bank se paisa mil rahaa he
 The common man is getting an opportunity to stand on his feet
 garib ho, madhyavarg kaa vyakti ho ghar bananaa chahta he, to bank usko madad karne ke liye aage aa rahe hai, kam byaaj kii dar se aage aa rahe hai
 It is working towards accelerating the economy of the country
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, ab ye vakt badal chukaa he
 We are in the 21st century
 vishwa kaa sabase bada yuva varg hamaare desh main he
 Our identity in the world is by IT, by Digital World
 kya ab bhi ham usee pooraani soch main rahenge
 Hey! Once upon a time, leather coins used to move, slowly disappeared, no one was asking
 aaj jo kaagaj ke note hai, samay aate rahete wo sara kaa sara Digital Currency main Convert hone vaala he
 Let us lead, let us take responsibility, let us go towards Digital Transaction
 ham BHIM APP ko apanaaen, aarthik kaarobaar kaa hissaa banaaen
 We also work through Prepaid
 or mujhe khushi he ki Digital lenden badi he
 It has increased by 34 percent over the previous year and about 44 percent in prepaid payments
 or isaliye kam cash vaali arthvyavastha, usko lekar ke hamen aage badhanaa chahie
 My dear countrymen, there are some schemes of the government that can save money in the pockets of the common man of India
 agar aap LED Bulb lagaate hai, to saal bhar kaa hajaar do hajaar paanch hajaar rupaya aapkaa bachane vaala he
 If you succeed in a clean India, then the poor's medicine of seven thousand rupees stops
 mahangaai par niyantran, aapke badhate hue kharch ko rokane main safal hua he, ek prakaar se aapaki bachat he
 Affordable medicine shops have become a huge blessing for the poor through 'jan Aushadhi Kendras'
 hamaare yahaan Operation ke peeche, stent ke peeche jo kharch hote the wo kam hue hai
 In the coming days, all facilities will also be available for Knee's operation
 hamaari koshish he ki garib or madhyamvarg ke maanav ke liye ye kharch kam ho or uske liye ham ek ke baad ek kadam uthaa rahe hai
 Earlier, dialysis used to take place in the headquarters of the states in our country
 hamane tay kiya hindustan ke jila kendron tak Dialysis pahunchaayenge
 Nearly three and a half hundred and four hundred districts have been reached and by dialysis for free, we are working to save the life of the poor
 aaj desh garv kar saktaa he ki hamane vishwa ke saamne apni vyavasthaaon ko viksit kiya he
 Today we have succeeded in arranging NAVIC Navigation through GPS System
 hamane SAARC Satellite ke dwaara hamane padosi deshon ke saath madad karne kaa safal abhiyaan kiya he
 We are delivering our importance inside the world today by 'tejas' airplane
 ‘BHIM-AADHAR App’ duniya ke andar Digital Transaction ke liye ek ajooba bana hua he
 rupay Card
 
 
 hindustan main rupay Card karodon kii taadaad main he
 And if it becomes operational, if it is in the pocket of the poor, then it will become the largest in the world
 or isaliye mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, meraa aapse yahi aagrah he ki ham ‘new India’ kaa sankalp le kar ke aage badhen, samay rahete hue karen
 It is said in our scriptures: Aniyat Kaal: Aniyat Kaal: Prabhutyo Viplavante, Prabhutayo Viplavante
 sahi samay par agar koi kaary puraa nahin kiya gaya, to phir icchit parinaam kabhi nahin milte hai
 And so for 'team India', for Team India of 1
25 billion countrymen, today we have to pledge to make 'new India' by 2022 and we will do this work ourselves, no one will do it, we will do it ourselves
 desh ke liye karenge, pehle se acha karenge, pehle se zyada karenge, samarpan bhav se karenge, 2022 main ‘bhavy-divya’ hindustan dekhne ke liye karenge
 And that's why we will all together create an India where the poor have a pucca house, electricity, water
 ham sab milakar ek aisa bharat banaaenge, jahaan desh kaa kisaan chintaa main nahin chaiyn se soyega
 By 2022, he will earn twice as much as he is earning today
 ham sab milakar ke ek aisa hindustan banaaenge, jahaan yuvaaon, mahilaon ko apane sapane puure karne ke liye bharpoor avasar uplabdh honge

 The comments sabhi kaa bahut bahut dhanyavad
 Sincerely: PIB yuvaaon ko bina guarantee swarozgaar ke liye aath karod se zyada loan kii sweekruti milti he
 The loan from the bank reduces the interest rates
 mahangaai par niyantran hota he
 If the middle class man wants to build his house, then he is provided with a low interest rate to build a house

 Adding a new dimension, giving a new emphasis
 jammu-kashmir kaa vikaas, jammu-kashmir kii unnati, jammu-kashmir ke saamaanya naagarik ke sapanom ko puraa karne kaa prayaas, ye jammu-kashmir kii sarkaar ke saath-saath, ham deshavaasiyon kaa bhi sankalp he
 Once again we experience this heaven, we are committed to bring it to that position, we are committed
 or isaliye main kahana chahta hum, kashmir ke andar jo kuch bhi hota he, bayaanbaji bhi bahut hoti hai, akshep pratiakshep bhi bahut hote hai, har koi ek duusare ko gaali dene main laga rahata he
 But brothers and sisters, i am clear that whatever happens in Kashmir, the separatists, a handful of separatists, these separatists form new tactics, but to win that battle, the subject is clear in my mind
 ‘na gaali se samasya sulajhane vaali he, na goli se samasya sulajhane vaali he, samasya suljhegi har kashmiri ko gale laga kar ke sulajhane vaali he’ or sava sau karod deshvasi yahi parampara se palaa bada he
 And therefore 'neither abuses nor bullets, change will be embraced' and with that resolve we are moving forward
 aatankwaad ke khilaaf kisi bhi prakaar kii narmi nahin barti jaaegi
 We have repeatedly told the terrorists that you come into the mainstream, in India's democracy, you have every right to talk, the whole system is there
 or mukhyadhara hi he jo har kisi ke jivan main nai urja bhar sakati he
 And that's why i am happy that due to the efforts of our security forces, a large number of young people have surrendered in the area of left-wing Extremism and tried to get into the mainstream
 seemaa kii raksha ke liye hamaare jawan tainaat hai
 i am happy that today the Government of India is launching a website which is the winner of Gallantry Award, the people who will make our country proud, along with their complete information, a portal based on the recipients of a Gallantry Award will also be started today
 It has been so that the new generation of the country can get a lot of information about these brave sacrifices of ours
 Technology kii madad se, desh main eemaandaaree ko bal dene kaa ham logon kaa bharpoor prayaas he
 Our fight against black money will continue
 bhrashtchaar ke khilaaf hamaari ladaai jari rahegi
 And we have gradually made many unsuccessful efforts towards bringing transparency, connecting the AADHAR system by interveneing technology and many people in the world discuss and study this model of India
 sarkaar main bhi kharidi karne main ab chota-sa vyakti bhi hajaaron kilometre dur baitha gaanv kaa vyakti bhi sarkaar ko apana maal supply kar saktaa he, apane product supply kar saktaa he
 He does not need an elder, he does not need a middleman
 GEM naam kaa ek portal banaaya he, GEM uske dwaara government procure kar rahi he
 It has been successful in bringing a lot of transparency
 bhaiyon-bahanon, sarkari kii yojanaon main raftaar badi he
 When the government is delayed in some work, it is not just the project delay
 wo sirf dhan ke kharchen se judaa hua vishay nahin hota he
 When any work gets stuck, stops, then my poor families suffer the most
 mere bhaiyo-bahanon ko hota he
 We can reach Mangalyaan within nine months
 yah hamaara samarthy he
 Mangalyaan can be reached from here within nine months
 lekin maine ek baar sarkaar ke kaam kaa lekha-jokha har maheene letaa rahata hum
 Once such a thing came to my attention, a 42-year-old project, a 70-72 km project, stuck on the rail for 42 years, was hanging
 bhaiyon-bahanon nau maheene main mangalayan pahunchane kaa samarthy rakhane vaala meraa desh 42 saal tak 70-72 kilometre ek rail kii patari na bicha sake, tab garib ke man main sawaal uthta he ki mere desh kaa kya hoga? or aisi chizon par hamane dhyaan diya he
 To change these things, we have tried to bring changes in them by adding all these things, be it the subject of new technology, geo-technology, space-technology
 aapane dekha hoga ek samay tha jab uria ke liye rajya or centre main tanaav chalata tha
 For kerosene, the state and center were tense
 ek aisa maahaul tha, jaise centre bada bhai, rajya chota bhai he
 The direction we worked from day one, because i have been the Chief Minister for a long time, so i know how important states are in the development of the country
 mukhyamantriyon kaa kitna mahatv he, rajyon kii sarkaron kaa kitna mahatv he, isko main bhalee-bhaanti samajhataa hum or isliye Co-operative Federalism or ab Competitive Co-operative Federalism us par hamane bal diya he or aapane dekha hoga ki aaj mil karke saare nirnay, ham mil karke kar rahe hai
 You will remember that from the ramparts of this Red Fort, once the Prime Minister discussed the plight of the power companies of the states of the country
 laal kile par se chintaa vyakt kerani padi thi
 Today, by taking the states together with the 'uday Yojana', by giving strength to the states, these problems were there in the business of the power factories, working together to solve it, this is a great proof of Federalism
 GST ke saath-saath chaahe Smart City ke nirmaan kii baat ho, chaahe swatchta kaa abhiyaan ho, chaahe toilet kii charchaa ho, Ease of doing Business kii baat ho, yah saare vishay aise hai ki hamaare desh ke sabhi rajya kandhe se kandhaa mila karke aaj bharat ke saath bharat kii sarkaar, kandhe se kandhaa mila karke rajya ke saath chalane main bahut safal ho rahi he
 My dear countrymen 'new India' is our greatest strength, democracy
 lekin ham jaanate hai ki hamane loktantr ko mat-patr tak simit kar diya he
 Democracy cannot be limited to ballot papers
 or isliye ham ‘new India’ main us loktantr par bal dena chaahate hai jisamen tantra se lok nahin, lekin logon se tantra chale, aisa loktantr ‘new India’ kii pahchaan bane, us disha main ham janaa chaahate hai
 Lokmanya Tilak ji had said, 'swarajya is my birth right'
 aaazaad bharat me ham sabakaa mantra hona chahie, ‘surajya meraa janmasiddh adhikaar he’
 'state' should be the responsibility of all of us
 naagarik ko apni jimmedaariyaan nibhaani chahie, sarkaron ne apni jimmedaariyaan nibhaani chahie
 When we have to walk from 'swarajya to Surajya', the countrymen do not stay back
 jab maine gas sabsidi chhodane ke liye kaha, desh aage aayaa
 Speaking of cleanliness, even today, in every corner of India, some one is carrying forward the cleanliness drive
 jab notebandi kii baat ai, duniya ko aashcharya hua tha, yahaan tak log kah rahe the, ab modi gaya
 But the patience of the 125 crore countrymen who showed in demonetisation, the faith that they told and the result of that, today we are succeeding in taking steps against corruption
 hamaare desh ke liye is nai lokbhagidaari kii parampara
 
 
 It is our effort to advance the country by public participation
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, laal bahadur shastri ne jai jawan jai kisaan kaa mantra diya tha
 The farmer of our country has never looked back, our farmer is giving record crop production today
 prakritik aapadaaon ke bich main nai–nai siddhiyaan wo hasil kar rahaa he
 There has been a record production of pulses and my dear brothers and sisters, my farmer brothers and sisters, there has never been a tradition of buying pulses in government in India and once in a while, according to thousands of tons It used to be, this time when the farmers of my country produced pulses and served nutritious food to the poor, the government increased this work by doing the historic work of buying 16 lakh tons of pulses Have received
 pradhanmantri fasal beemaa yojana, ek suraksha kavach mere kisaan bhaiyon ko mila he
 Three years ago, only 1
25 crore farmers used to take advantage of this Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, which was earlier known by another name
 aaj pradhanmantri fasal beemaa yojana main itane kam samay main kai naye kisaan iske saath jud gaye hai or kareeb-kareeb ye sankhya aage chalakar ke paune chah karod par pahunchi he
 The Prime Minister Agricultural Irrigation Scheme, if the farmer gets water, has the power to produce gold from the soil and so to provide water to the farmer last time i told the Red Fort, we have completed 21 of those schemes and the rest 50 plans will be completed in the coming time
 or total 99 yojanaon kaa maine sankalp liya he
 We will complete the water supply to the farmer's farm by completing those 99 big plans before 2019
 or kisaan ko beej se bazaar tak, jab tak ham vyastha nahin dete hai, hamaare kisaan ke bhagya ko ham nahin badal sakate hai
 And therefore it needs infrastructure, it needs supply-chain
 har saal lakhon-karodon rupayon kii hamaari sabji, hamaare fal, hamaari fasal barbaad ho jaati he or isliye usko badalane ke liye ek to Foreign Direct Investment ko badhaava diya taaki food processing ke andar duniya hamaare saath jude
 Promoted to create infrastructure and Government of India has implemented 'pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojana'
 jiske kaaran un vyavasthaaon kaa nirmaan kiya jayega jo beej se bazaar tak kisaan ko hand-holding karenge, vyavasthaaen viksit karenge or hamaare karodon kisaanon kii jindagi main ek nayaa badlaav laane main ham safal honge
 Due to Demand and Technology, the nature of job is also changing in our country
 rojgaar se judi yojanaon main, training ke tareeke main 21veen sadi kii aavashyaktaaon ke anusaar, maanav sansaadhan ke vikaas ke liye bharat sarkaar ne anek nai yojanaayen haath main lee hai
 a huge campaign has been launched to ensure that the youth get money from banks without guarantee
 hamaara noujvaan apane pairon par khadaa ho, wo rojgaar paane vaala rahe, rojgaar dene vaala bane, or pichley teen saal main dekha he ki ‘pradhanmantri mudra yojana’ ke kaaran karodon noujvaan apane pairon par khadey hue hai
 Not only this, a young man is also employing one or two to three more people
 shiksha ke kshetra main World Class Universities banane ke liye hamane bandhanon se mukti dene kaa ek bada ahm kadam uthaaya he
 20 Universities have been called upon to decide their fate, Government will not come anywhere
 upar se sarkaar 1000 karod rupee tak kii madad karne ke liye bhi taiyaar he
 Has given a call, i am sure the educational institutions of my country will definitely come forward and make it successful
 pichley teen varsh main 6 IIT, 7 nae IIM, 8 nae IIIT, iskaa nirmaan kiya he or shiksha ko naukari ke avasaron ke saath jodne kaa bhi is ko kaam hamane kiya he
 My mothers, sisters, today, in large quantities, women in the family also go for employment
 or isliye raatri ko bhi unako rojgaar kaa avasar mili, factoriyon main kaam karne kaa avasar mili, isliye Labour Laws main parivartan karne kaa bahut bada ahm kadam uthaaya he
 Our mothers and sisters are also an important unit of the family
 hamaara bhavishya nirmaan karne ke liye hamaari maataaon, bahanon kaa yogadan bahut bada hota he, or isliye Maternity Leave jo 12 saptaah kii thi, wo 26 saptaah, usamen aay chaalu rahegi, is prakaar se dene kaa kaam kiya he
 With regard to the work of empowerment of our women today, in particular, i would like to congratulate the sisters who have been forced to live a very difficult life due to triple talaq
 koi aashray nahin bachaa he, or aisi peedit, teen-talaak se peedit bahanon ne puure desh main ek andolan khadaa kiya he
 The intellectual class of the country was shaken, the media of the country also helped them, an atmosphere was created against triple talaq in the whole country
 is andolan ko chalaane vaali un meri bahanon ko, jo teen-talaak ke khilaaf ladai lard rahi hai, main hriday se unka abhindann karata hum or mujhe vishwaas he, ki maataaon-bahanon ko adhikaar dilaane main, unki is ladaai main hindustan unki puri madad karegaa
 Hindustan will help and it will be successful in this important step of Women Empowerment; i am sure of this
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyo, kabhi-kabhi aasthaa ke naam par dhairya ke abhaav main kuch log aisi chijen kar baithte hai, jo samaaj ke taane-bane ko bikher detii hai
 The country operates with peace, goodwill and unity
 jatvaad kaa jehar, sampradayawad kaa jehar, desh kaa kabhi bhala nahin kar saktaa he
 This is Gandhi's land, Buddha's land, take everyone along and walk; It is part of the culture and tradition of this country
 hamen isko safalataa se aage badhanaa he, or isliye aasthaa ke naam par hinsa ko bal nahin diya ja saktaa he
 If something happens to the patient in the hospital, the hospital is burnt; Accidentally, carts should be burnt; Move, government property be burned; Whose is this for Azad Hindustan? We have assets of 1
25 billion countrymen
 ye saanskrithik viraasat kiski he? ye ham sava sau karod deshavaasiyon kii saanskrithik viraasat he
 Whose faith is this? We are the faith of 125 crore countrymen; And so the path of violence in the name of faith can never go on in this country, this country can never accept
 or isliye main deshavaasiyon se aagrah karuunga, us samay ‘bharat chodo’ kaa naaraa tha, aaj naaraa he ‘bharat jodo’
 We have to take person-to-person, take people-to-people, we have to take every section of the society together, and we have to take the country forward by taking the same
 samrudh bharat banane ke liye hamaari majboot arthvyavastha chahie
 We need balanced development, next generation infrastructure, then we can see the India of our dreams in front of our eyes
 bhaaiyo-bahanon, anginat nirnay hamane teen saal main liye
 Some things have been noted and some things may not have come into notice
 lekin ek baat mahatvapurn he
 When you make such a big change, the stops come, the speed stops
 lekin is sarkaar kii kaaryastylee dekhie, agar train bhi kisi railway stesan ke paas se guzarati he, jab trek badalati he to 60 se chalane vaali speed ko usko 30 kii speed main laana padataa he
 The speed of the train decreases by changing the track
 ham puure desh ko ek nae trek par le jane kaa prayaas kar rahe hai, lekin hamane uski speed kam nahin hone di he, hamane uski gati ko barkaraar rakhaa he
 Whether we bring GST, any law, any new system, we have succeeded in doing that and we will do it in future
 hamane infrastructure par bal diya he
 Unprecedented expenses are being given on infrastructure
 railway stesan kaa aadhunikeekaran ho, chote shahar main, chaahe airport bananaa ho, chaahe water-way kii vyavastha kerani ho, chaahe roadways kii vyavastha kerani ho, chaahe gas grid banani ho, chaahe pani kii grid karaani ho, chaahe optical fibre network karnaa ho, har prakaar ke aadhunik infrastructure par ham purna bal de rahe hai
 My dear countrymen, our eastern India is the most energetic field to advance India in the 21st century
 itnaa potential he, samarthyavan maanav sansaadhan he, apaar prakritik sampada he, parishram ke dhani hai, sankalp karke jindagi badalane kaa samarthy rakhte hai
 Our entire focus is on eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Bengal, Assam, North East, Odisha, these are our powerful states, where natural wealth is abundant, we are trying to take the country to a new height by taking it forward
 bhaaiyo-bahanon, bhrashtachar mukt bharat ek bada ahm kaam he, usko ham bal dene kaa prayaas kar rahe he
 After the formation of the government, the first task was to create SIT
 aaj teen saal ke baad main deshavaasiyon ko bataanaa chahta hum, garv se bataanaa chahta hum ki teen saal ke bheetar-bheetar, kareeb-kareeb sava lakh karod rupye se bhi zyada kalaadhan ko hamane khoj diya he, usko pakadaa he or usko suurender karne ke liye majaboor kiya he
 After that we decided to demonetise
 notebandi ke dwaara hamane anek mahatvapurn safaltaaen praapt kii hai
 The black money that was hidden had to come into the mainstream
 aapane dekha hoga ki ham kabhi 07 din-10 din-15 din badhaate jate the, kabhi petrol pump par, kabhi dawaai kii dukaan par, kabhi railway stesan par puraane note lene kaa silsilaa jari rakhte the, kyonki hamaara prayaas tha ki ek baar jo bhi dhan aae wo bainkon main formal economy kaa hissaa ban jaae or us kaam ko hamane safaltaapurvak paar kiya he
 And the reason for this is that the research that has been done now, is about three lakh crore rupees
 
 
 ye sarkaar ne research nahin kii he, baahar ke expert ne kii he
 Three lakh crore rupees after demonetisation, the additional, which never came back in the banking system, has come
 bainkon main jamaa kii gai raashi main paune do lakh karod se adhik raashi shaq ke ghere main he
 At least two lakh crore rupees of black money has had to reach the banks and now they are forced to give their answers with the system
 nae kaledhan par bhi bahut badi rukaawat aa gai he
 This year, see the result, 56 lakh new taxpayers filing income tax returns from 01 April to 05 August
 pichley saal usee avadhi main ye sankhya sirf 22 lakh thi
 More than double! These reasons are the result of our fight against black money
 18 lakh se zyada aise logon ko pahchaan liya gaya he, jinaki aay unke hisaab kitaab se kuch zyada he, beshumaar zyada he or isaliye is antar kaa unako jawaab dena pad rahaa he
 Out of this, four and a half lakh people have now come to the field, accepting their mistake and trying to get in the way
 ek lakh log aise saamne aae hai, jinhone kabhi jindagi main Income Tax kaa naam bhi nahin suna tha, na Income Tax kabhi diya tha, na kabhi unhone us par sochaa tha, lekin aaj unako wo karnaa pad rahaa he
 Brothers and sisters, if two or four companies are shut down in our country, then there are discussions on them round the clock
 arthniti khatm ho gai


 ye ho gaya, na jane kya kya hota he! aapako jaanakar ke hairaani hogi, kaale dhan ke kaarobaari, Shell companiyaan chalaate the or notebandi ke baad jab data-mining kiya gaya
 Then three lakh such companies have been found, which are just and shell companies only
 hawala kaa kaarobaar karti hai
 Three lakhs, one can imagine
 or usamen se paune do lakh kaa registration hamanen Cancel kar diya he
 If five companies are closed, then there is a storm in India
 paune do lakh companiyon ko taale laga diye
 Those who looted the goods of the country will have to answer, we did this by doing this
 aapako hairaani hogi! kuch to shell companiyaan aisi hai, jo ek hi Address par chaar sau chaar sau companiyaan chal rahi thim, bhaaiyon bahanon
 Four hundred and four hundred companies were operating
 koi dekhne vaala nahin tha, koi poochne vaala nahin tha
 All the collusion was going on
 or isaliye mere bhaaiyon bahanon, maine bhrashtachar kaale dhan ke khilaaf ek bahut badi ladaai chhedi he
 For the betterment of the country, for the welfare of the poor of the country, for the future of the youth of the country
 bhaaiyon bahanon, ek ke baad ek kadam or mujhe vishwaas he GST ke baad usamen or badhotaree hone vaali he
 And Transparency is forthcoming
 akele Transportation hamaara trek vaala ek sthaan se duusare sthaan par jaataa tha
 After this GST, thirty percent of his time is saved
 check-post khatm hone ke kaaran hajaaron karod rupayon kii to bachat hui he
 The biggest savings have been time
 ek prakaar se uski tees pratishat Efficiency bad rahi he
 You can imagine what it means to increase thirty percent efficiency in the transport world of India
 ek GST ke kaaran itnaa bada parivartan aayaa he
 My dear countrymen, today money has come to banks due to demonetisation
 bank apni byaaj dar kam kar rahe hai
 The common man is getting money from the bank through currency
 saamaanya maanav ko apane pairon par khadey hone ke liye avasar mil rahaa he
 Be poor, a middle class person wants to build a house, then banks are coming forward to help him, coming at a lower rate of interest
 ye sara desh ke arthtantr ko gati dene kii disha main kaam kar rahaa he
 My dear countrymen, now is the time
 ham 21veen sadi main hai
 The largest youth group in the world is in our country
 duniya main hamaari pahchaan IT ke dwaara he, Digital World ke dwaara he
 Will we still remain in the same old thinking? are! ek jamaane main chamade ke sikke chalate the, dhire-dhire lupt ho gaye, koi poochne vaala nahin rahaa
 Today the paper notes are going to be converted into digital currency all the time
 ham netritv karen, ham jimmevary len, ham Digital Transaction kii ore jaaen
 We adopt BHIM APP, become part of economic business
 ham Prepaid ke dwaara bhi kaam karen
 And i am happy that Digital transactions have grown
 pichley saal ke mukaable usamen 34 pratishat kaa ijapha hua he or Prepaid bhugtan main kareeb 44 pratishat kaa
 And that's why we should go ahead with a low cash economy
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, sarkaar kii kuch yojanaayen aisi hai, jo hindustan ke saamaanya maanav kii jeb main paise bachaa saken
 If you put an LED bulb, then a thousand rupees two thousand five thousand rupees of the year are going to save you
 agar aap svachh bharat main safal hote hai, to garib kaa saat hajaar kaa rupaya dawaai kaa band hota he
 Controlling inflation has been successful in curbing your rising expenses, in a way your savings
 ‘jan aushadhi kendron’ ke dwaara sasti dawaai kii dukaan garib ke liye ek bahut bada aashirwad bani he
 The expenses that were behind our operation, behind the stent, have come down
 aane vaale dinon main Knee ke Operation ke liye bhi sari suvidhaayen milengi
 Our effort is to reduce these expenses for the poor and middle class human beings and for that we are taking steps one after the other
 pehle hamaare desh main rajyon ke mukhyalay main Dialysis hua karata tha
 We decided to deliver dialysis to the district centers of India
 kareeb saadhe teen sau, chaar sau jilon tak pahunchaa diya or muft main Dialysis karke garib kii jindagi bachaane kaa kaam ham kar rahe hai
 Today the country can be proud that we have developed our systems in front of the world
 GPS System ke dwaara NAVIC Navigation kii vyavastha aaj karne main ham safal hue hai
 Through SAARC Satellite, we have successfully campaigned to help with neighboring countries
 ham ‘tejas’ hawaii jahaaj ke dwaara aaj duniya ke andar apni ahmiyat pahunchaa rahe hai
 The 'BHIM-AADHAR App' is a wonder within the world for Digital Transaction
 rupay Card 
 
 
 In India, rupay Card is worth crores
 or agar wo operational ho jayega, wo agar garibon ke jeb main he, to duniya kaa, ye sabase bada ho jayega
 And that's why my dear countrymen, i request you to move ahead by taking a pledge for 'new India', and do it in time
 hamaare yahaan shastron main kaha gaya haih aniyat kaal:, aniyat kaalah prabhutayo viplavante, prabhutayo viplavante
 If a task is not completed at the right time, then the desired result is never achieved
 or isaliye ‘team India’ ke liye, sava sau karod deshavaasiyon kii team India ke liye, aaj hamen sankalp lenaa hoga 2022 tak ‘new India’ banane kaa or ye kaam ham khud karenge, koi karegaa aisa nahin, ham khud karenge
 Will do for the country, will do better than before, will do more than before, will do it with dedication, in 2022 to see 'grand-divine' Hindustan
 or isaliye ham sab milakar ke ek aisa bharat banaaenge jahaan garib ke paas pakkaa ghar ho, bijli ho, pani ho
 Together we will create an India where the farmer of the country will sleep peacefully
 aaj wo jitna kama rahaa he, usase 2022 tak doguna kamayega
 Together we will create an India where youth and women will have ample opportunities to fulfill their dreams
 ham sab milakar ke ek aisa bharat banaaenge, jo aatankwaad sampradayawad or jatvaad se mukt hoga
 Together we will create an India where there will be no compromise on corruption and nepotism
 ham sab milakar ke ek aisa bharat banaaenge, jo svachh hoga, swasth hoga or swaraj ke sapane ko puraa karegaa
 And therefore my dear countrymen, we will all try to work together in this race of development
 aaj aazaadee ke 70 saal ke baad, aazaadee ke 75 saal kii pratiksha ke bich paanch saal ke mahatvapurn kaarykaal main ek ‘divya-bhavy bharat’ ke sapane ko lekar ke ham sabhi deshvasi chalem, isi ek bhav ke saath main phir ek baar aazaadee ke diwaanon ko pranaam karata hum
 i salute the new faith, new zeal of 1
25 billion countrymen

 With this feeling, my heartiest greetings to all of you

 Whether we have talked about ending the interview, whether we have talked about ending the process
 akele labour field main, saamaanya chote se kaarobaari ko bhi 50-60 form bharne padate the, usko ham kam karke sirf paanch form main le aae hai
 That is to say, i can give a lot of examples, to say that it means that Good Governance, simplifying the process of Governance, is the result of emphasizing in that direction, today there has been a fast pace, decisions have come fast
 is
 or isaliye sava sau karod deshvasi is vishwaas ko lekar aage bad rahe hai
 My dear countrymen, today India's credibility is increasing in the world
 aatankwaad ke khilaaf ladaai, mere deshavaasiyon aapako jaanakar ke khushi hogi aatankwaad ke khilaaf ladaai main aaj ham akele nahin hai
 Many countries of the world are actively helping us
 hawala kaa kaarobaar ho, to duniya hamen jaankaree de rahi he
 Regarding the activities of terrorists, the world is giving us information
 ham vishwa ke saath kandhe se kandhaa milakar ke aatankwaadiyon ke khilaaf ladaai lard rahe hai
 i wish to congratulate all the countries of the world, who are helping us in this work well, increase the prestige of India, and this global relationship is also a part of India's peace and security
 Adding a new dimension, giving a new emphasis
 jammu-kashmir kaa vikaas, jammu-kashmir kii unnati, jammu-kashmir ke saamaanya naagarik ke sapanom ko puraa karne kaa prayaas, ye jammu-kashmir kii sarkaar ke saath-saath, ham deshavaasiyon kaa bhi sankalp he
 Once again we experience this heaven, we are committed to bring it to that position, we are committed
 or isaliye main kahana chahta hum, kashmir ke andar jo kuch bhi hota he, bayaanbaji bhi bahut hoti hai, akshep pratiakshep bhi bahut hote hai, har koi ek duusare ko gaali dene main laga rahata he
 But brothers and sisters, i am clear that whatever happens in Kashmir, the separatists, a handful of separatists, these separatists form new tactics, but to win that battle, the subject is clear in my mind
 ‘na gaali se samasya sulajhane vaali he, na goli se samasya sulajhane vaali he, samasya suljhegi har kashmiri ko gale laga kar ke sulajhane vaali he’ or sava sau karod deshvasi yahi parampara se palaa bada he
 And therefore 'neither abuses nor bullets, change will be embraced' and with that resolve we are moving forward
 aatankwaad ke khilaaf kisi bhi prakaar kii narmi nahin barti jaaegi
 We have repeatedly told the terrorists that you come into the mainstream, in India's democracy, you have every right to talk, the whole system is there
 or mukhyadhara hi he jo har kisi ke jivan main nai urja bhar sakati he
 And that's why i am happy that due to the efforts of our security forces, a large number of young people have surrendered in the area of left-wing Extremism and tried to get into the mainstream
 seemaa kii raksha ke liye hamaare jawan tainaat hai
 i am happy that today the Government of India is launching a website which is the winner of Gallantry Award, the people who will make our country proud, along with their complete information, a portal based on the recipients of a Gallantry Award will also be started today
 It has been so that the new generation of the country can get a lot of information about these brave sacrifices of ours
 Technology kii madad se, desh main eemaandaaree ko bal dene kaa ham logon kaa bharpoor prayaas he
 Our fight against black money will continue
 bhrashtchaar ke khilaaf hamaari ladaai jari rahegi
 And we have gradually made many unsuccessful efforts towards bringing transparency, connecting the AADHAR system by interveneing technology and many people in the world discuss and study this model of India
 sarkaar main bhi kharidi karne main ab chota-sa vyakti bhi hajaaron kilometre dur baitha gaanv kaa vyakti bhi sarkaar ko apana maal supply kar saktaa he, apane product supply kar saktaa he
 He does not need an elder, he does not need a middleman
 GEM naam kaa ek portal banaaya he, GEM uske dwaara government procure kar rahi he
 It has been successful in bringing a lot of transparency
 bhaiyon-bahanon, sarkari kii yojanaon main raftaar badi he
 When the government is delayed in some work, it is not just the project delay
 wo sirf dhan ke kharchen se judaa hua vishay nahin hota he
 When any work gets stuck, stops, then my poor families suffer the most
 mere bhaiyo-bahanon ko hota he
 We can reach Mangalyaan within nine months
 yah hamaara samarthy he
 Mangalyaan can be reached from here within nine months
 lekin maine ek baar sarkaar ke kaam kaa lekha-jokha har maheene letaa rahata hum
 Once such a thing came to my attention, a 42-year-old project, a 70-72 km project, stuck on the rail for 42 years, was hanging
 bhaiyon-bahanon nau maheene main mangalayan pahunchane kaa samarthy rakhane vaala meraa desh 42 saal tak 70-72 kilometre ek rail kii patari na bicha sake, tab garib ke man main sawaal uthta he ki mere desh kaa kya hoga? or aisi chizon par hamane dhyaan diya he
 To change these things, we have tried to bring changes in them by adding all these things, be it the subject of new technology, geo-technology, space-technology
 aapane dekha hoga ek samay tha jab uria ke liye rajya or centre main tanaav chalata tha
 For kerosene, the state and center were tense
 ek aisa maahaul tha, jaise centre bada bhai, rajya chota bhai he
 The direction we worked from day one, because i have been the Chief Minister for a long time, so i know how important states are in the development of the country
 mukhyamantriyon kaa kitna mahatv he, rajyon kii sarkaron kaa kitna mahatv he, isko main bhalee-bhaanti samajhataa hum or isliye Co-operative Federalism or ab Competitive Co-operative Federalism us par hamane bal diya he or aapane dekha hoga ki aaj mil karke saare nirnay, ham mil karke kar rahe hai
 You will remember that from the ramparts of this Red Fort, once the Prime Minister discussed the plight of the power companies of the states of the country
 laal kile par se chintaa vyakt kerani padi thi
 Today, by taking the states together with the 'uday Yojana', by giving strength to the states, these problems were there in the business of the power factories, working together to solve it, this is a great proof of Federalism
 GST ke saath-saath chaahe Smart City ke nirmaan kii baat ho, chaahe swatchta kaa abhiyaan ho, chaahe toilet kii charchaa ho, Ease of doing Business kii baat ho, yah saare vishay aise hai ki hamaare desh ke sabhi rajya kandhe se kandhaa mila karke aaj bharat ke saath bharat kii sarkaar, kandhe se kandhaa mila karke rajya ke saath chalane main bahut safal ho rahi he
 My dear countrymen 'new India' is our greatest strength, democracy
 lekin ham jaanate hai ki hamane loktantr ko mat-patr tak simit kar diya he
 Democracy cannot be limited to ballot papers
 or isliye ham ‘new India’ main us loktantr par bal dena chaahate hai jisamen tantra se lok nahin, lekin logon se tantra chale, aisa loktantr ‘new India’ kii pahchaan bane, us disha main ham janaa chaahate hai
 Lokmanya Tilak ji had said, 'swarajya is my birth right'
 aaazaad bharat me ham sabakaa mantra hona chahie, ‘surajya meraa janmasiddh adhikaar he’
 'state' should be the responsibility of all of us
 naagarik ko apni jimmedaariyaan nibhaani chahie, sarkaron ne apni jimmedaariyaan nibhaani chahie
 When we have to walk from 'swarajya to Surajya', the countrymen do not stay back
 jab maine gas sabsidi chhodane ke liye kaha, desh aage aayaa
 Speaking of cleanliness, even today, in every corner of India, some one is carrying forward the cleanliness drive
 jab notebandi kii baat ai, duniya ko aashcharya hua tha, yahaan tak log kah rahe the, ab modi gaya
 But the patience of the 125 crore countrymen who showed in demonetisation, the faith that they told and the result of that, today we are succeeding in taking steps against corruption
 hamaare desh ke liye is nai lokbhagidaari kii parampara
 
 
 It is our effort to advance the country by public participation
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, laal bahadur shastri ne jai jawan jai kisaan kaa mantra diya tha
 The farmer of our country has never looked back, our farmer is giving record crop production today
 prakritik aapadaaon ke bich main nai–nai siddhiyaan wo hasil kar rahaa he
 There has been a record production of pulses and my dear brothers and sisters, my farmer brothers and sisters, there has never been a tradition of buying pulses in government in India and once in a while, according to thousands of tons It used to be, this time when the farmers of my country produced pulses and served nutritious food to the poor, the government increased this work by doing the historic work of buying 16 lakh tons of pulses Have received
 pradhanmantri fasal beemaa yojana, ek suraksha kavach mere kisaan bhaiyon ko mila he
 Three years ago, only 1
25 crore farmers used to take advantage of this Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, which was earlier known by another name
 aaj pradhanmantri fasal beemaa yojana main itane kam samay main kai naye kisaan iske saath jud gaye hai or kareeb-kareeb ye sankhya aage chalakar ke paune chah karod par pahunchi he
 The Prime Minister Agricultural Irrigation Scheme, if the farmer gets water, has the power to produce gold from the soil and so to provide water to the farmer last time i told the Red Fort, we have completed 21 of those schemes and the rest 50 plans will be completed in the coming time
 or total 99 yojanaon kaa maine sankalp liya he
 We will complete the water supply to the farmer's farm by completing those 99 big plans before 2019
 or kisaan ko beej se bazaar tak, jab tak ham vyastha nahin dete hai, hamaare kisaan ke bhagya ko ham nahin badal sakate hai
 And therefore it needs infrastructure, it needs supply-chain
 har saal lakhon-karodon rupayon kii hamaari sabji, hamaare fal, hamaari fasal barbaad ho jaati he or isliye usko badalane ke liye ek to Foreign Direct Investment ko badhaava diya taaki food processing ke andar duniya hamaare saath jude
 Promoted to create infrastructure and Government of India has implemented 'pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojana'
 jiske kaaran un vyavasthaaon kaa nirmaan kiya jayega jo beej se bazaar tak kisaan ko hand-holding karenge, vyavasthaaen viksit karenge or hamaare karodon kisaanon kii jindagi main ek nayaa badlaav laane main ham safal honge
 Due to Demand and Technology, the nature of job is also changing in our country
 rojgaar se judi yojanaon main, training ke tareeke main 21veen sadi kii aavashyaktaaon ke anusaar, maanav sansaadhan ke vikaas ke liye bharat sarkaar ne anek nai yojanaayen haath main lee hai
 a huge campaign has been launched to ensure that the youth get money from banks without guarantee
 hamaara noujvaan apane pairon par khadaa ho, wo rojgaar paane vaala rahe, rojgaar dene vaala bane, or pichley teen saal main dekha he ki ‘pradhanmantri mudra yojana’ ke kaaran karodon noujvaan apane pairon par khadey hue hai
 Not only this, a young man is also employing one or two to three more people
 shiksha ke kshetra main World Class Universities banane ke liye hamane bandhanon se mukti dene kaa ek bada ahm kadam uthaaya he
 20 Universities have been called upon to decide their fate, Government will not come anywhere
 upar se sarkaar 1000 karod rupee tak kii madad karne ke liye bhi taiyaar he
 Has given a call, i am sure the educational institutions of my country will definitely come forward and make it successful
 pichley teen varsh main 6 IIT, 7 nae IIM, 8 nae IIIT, iskaa nirmaan kiya he or shiksha ko naukari ke avasaron ke saath jodne kaa bhi is ko kaam hamane kiya he
 My mothers, sisters, today, in large quantities, women in the family also go for employment
 or isliye raatri ko bhi unako rojgaar kaa avasar mili, factoriyon main kaam karne kaa avasar mili, isliye Labour Laws main parivartan karne kaa bahut bada ahm kadam uthaaya he
 Our mothers and sisters are also an important unit of the family
 hamaara bhavishya nirmaan karne ke liye hamaari maataaon, bahanon kaa yogadan bahut bada hota he, or isliye Maternity Leave jo 12 saptaah kii thi, wo 26 saptaah, usamen aay chaalu rahegi, is prakaar se dene kaa kaam kiya he
 With regard to the work of empowerment of our women today, in particular, i would like to congratulate the sisters who have been forced to live a very difficult life due to triple talaq
 koi aashray nahin bachaa he, or aisi peedit, teen-talaak se peedit bahanon ne puure desh main ek andolan khadaa kiya he
 The intellectual class of the country was shaken, the media of the country also helped them, an atmosphere was created against triple talaq in the whole country
 is andolan ko chalaane vaali un meri bahanon ko, jo teen-talaak ke khilaaf ladai lard rahi hai, main hriday se unka abhindann karata hum or mujhe vishwaas he, ki maataaon-bahanon ko adhikaar dilaane main, unki is ladaai main hindustan unki puri madad karegaa
 Hindustan will help and it will be successful in this important step of Women Empowerment; i am sure of this
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyo, kabhi-kabhi aasthaa ke naam par dhairya ke abhaav main kuch log aisi chijen kar baithte hai, jo samaaj ke taane-bane ko bikher detii hai
 The country operates with peace, goodwill and unity
 jatvaad kaa jehar, sampradayawad kaa jehar, desh kaa kabhi bhala nahin kar saktaa he
 This is Gandhi's land, Buddha's land, take everyone along and walk; It is part of the culture and tradition of this country
 hamen isko safalataa se aage badhanaa he, or isliye aasthaa ke naam par hinsa ko bal nahin diya ja saktaa he
 If something happens to the patient in the hospital, the hospital is burnt; Accidentally, carts should be burnt; Move, government property be burned; Whose is this for Azad Hindustan? We have assets of 1
25 billion countrymen
 ye saanskrithik viraasat kiski he? ye ham sava sau karod deshavaasiyon kii saanskrithik viraasat he
 Whose faith is this? We are the faith of 125 crore countrymen; And so the path of violence in the name of faith can never go on in this country, this country can never accept
 or isliye main deshavaasiyon se aagrah karuunga, us samay ‘bharat chodo’ kaa naaraa tha, aaj naaraa he ‘bharat jodo’
 We have to take person-to-person, take people-to-people, we have to take every section of the society together, and we have to take the country forward by taking the same
 samrudh bharat banane ke liye hamaari majboot arthvyavastha chahie
 We need balanced development, next generation infrastructure, then we can see the India of our dreams in front of our eyes
 bhaaiyo-bahanon, anginat nirnay hamane teen saal main liye
 Some things have been noted and some things may not have come into notice
 lekin ek baat mahatvapurn he
 When you make such a big change, the stops come, the speed stops
 lekin is sarkaar kii kaaryastylee dekhie, agar train bhi kisi railway stesan ke paas se guzarati he, jab trek badalati he to 60 se chalane vaali speed ko usko 30 kii speed main laana padataa he
 The speed of the train decreases by changing the track
 ham puure desh ko ek nae trek par le jane kaa prayaas kar rahe hai, lekin hamane uski speed kam nahin hone di he, hamane uski gati ko barkaraar rakhaa he
 Whether we bring GST, any law, any new system, we have succeeded in doing that and we will do it in future
 hamane infrastructure par bal diya he
 Unprecedented expenses are being given on infrastructure
 railway stesan kaa aadhunikeekaran ho, chote shahar main, chaahe airport bananaa ho, chaahe water-way kii vyavastha kerani ho, chaahe roadways kii vyavastha kerani ho, chaahe gas grid banani ho, chaahe pani kii grid karaani ho, chaahe optical fibre network karnaa ho, har prakaar ke aadhunik infrastructure par ham purna bal de rahe hai
 My dear countrymen, our eastern India is the most energetic field to advance India in the 21st century
 itnaa potential he, samarthyavan maanav sansaadhan he, apaar prakritik sampada he, parishram ke dhani hai, sankalp karke jindagi badalane kaa samarthy rakhte hai
 Our entire focus is on eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Bengal, Assam, North East, Odisha, these are our powerful states, where natural wealth is abundant, we are trying to take the country to a new height by taking it forward
 bhaaiyo-bahanon, bhrashtachar mukt bharat ek bada ahm kaam he, usko ham bal dene kaa prayaas kar rahe he
 After the formation of the government, the first task was to create SIT
 aaj teen saal ke baad main deshavaasiyon ko bataanaa chahta hum, garv se bataanaa chahta hum ki teen saal ke bheetar-bheetar, kareeb-kareeb sava lakh karod rupye se bhi zyada kalaadhan ko hamane khoj diya he, usko pakadaa he or usko suurender karne ke liye majaboor kiya he
 After that we decided to demonetise
 notebandi ke dwaara hamane anek mahatvapurn safaltaaen praapt kii hai
 The black money that was hidden had to come into the mainstream
 aapane dekha hoga ki ham kabhi 07 din-10 din-15 din badhaate jate the, kabhi petrol pump par, kabhi dawaai kii dukaan par, kabhi railway stesan par puraane note lene kaa silsilaa jari rakhte the, kyonki hamaara prayaas tha ki ek baar jo bhi dhan aae wo bainkon main formal economy kaa hissaa ban jaae or us kaam ko hamane safaltaapurvak paar kiya he
 And the reason for this is that the research that has been done now, is about three lakh crore rupees
 
 
 ye sarkaar ne research nahin kii he, baahar ke expert ne kii he
 Three lakh crore rupees after demonetisation, the additional, which never came back in the banking system, has come
 bainkon main jamaa kii gai raashi main paune do lakh karod se adhik raashi shaq ke ghere main he
 At least two lakh crore rupees of black money has had to reach the banks and now they are forced to give their answers with the system
 nae kaledhan par bhi bahut badi rukaawat aa gai he
 This year, see the result, 56 lakh new taxpayers filing income tax returns from 01 April to 05 August
 pichley saal usee avadhi main ye sankhya sirf 22 lakh thi
 More than double! These reasons are the result of our fight against black money
 18 lakh se zyada aise logon ko pahchaan liya gaya he, jinaki aay unke hisaab kitaab se kuch zyada he, beshumaar zyada he or isaliye is antar kaa unako jawaab dena pad rahaa he
 Out of this, four and a half lakh people have now come to the field, accepting their mistake and trying to get in the way
 ek lakh log aise saamne aae hai, jinhone kabhi jindagi main Income Tax kaa naam bhi nahin suna tha, na Income Tax kabhi diya tha, na kabhi unhone us par sochaa tha, lekin aaj unako wo karnaa pad rahaa he
 Brothers and sisters, if two or four companies are shut down in our country, then there are discussions on them round the clock
 arthniti khatm ho gai


 ye ho gaya, na jane kya kya hota he! aapako jaanakar ke hairaani hogi, kaale dhan ke kaarobaari, Shell companiyaan chalaate the or notebandi ke baad jab data-mining kiya gaya
 Then three lakh such companies have been found, which are just and shell companies only
 hawala kaa kaarobaar karti hai
 Three lakhs, one can imagine
 or usamen se paune do lakh kaa registration hamanen Cancel kar diya he
 If five companies are closed, then there is a storm in India
 paune do lakh companiyon ko taale laga diye
 Those who looted the goods of the country will have to answer, we did this by doing this
 aapako hairaani hogi! kuch to shell companiyaan aisi hai, jo ek hi Address par chaar sau chaar sau companiyaan chal rahi thim, bhaaiyon bahanon
 Four hundred and four hundred companies were operating
 koi dekhne vaala nahin tha, koi poochne vaala nahin tha
 All the collusion was going on
 or isaliye mere bhaaiyon bahanon, maine bhrashtachar kaale dhan ke khilaaf ek bahut badi ladaai chhedi he
 For the betterment of the country, for the welfare of the poor of the country, for the future of the youth of the country
 bhaaiyon bahanon, ek ke baad ek kadam or mujhe vishwaas he GST ke baad usamen or badhotaree hone vaali he
 And Transparency is forthcoming
 akele Transportation hamaara trek vaala ek sthaan se duusare sthaan par jaataa tha
 After this GST, thirty percent of his time is saved
 check-post khatm hone ke kaaran hajaaron karod rupayon kii to bachat hui he
 The biggest savings have been time
 ek prakaar se uski tees pratishat Efficiency bad rahi he
 You can imagine what it means to increase thirty percent efficiency in the transport world of India
 ek GST ke kaaran itnaa bada parivartan aayaa he
 My dear countrymen, today money has come to banks due to demonetisation
 bank apni byaaj dar kam kar rahe hai
 The common man is getting money from the bank through currency
 saamaanya maanav ko apane pairon par khadey hone ke liye avasar mil rahaa he
 Be poor, a middle class person wants to build a house, then banks are coming forward to help him, coming at a lower rate of interest
 ye sara desh ke arthtantr ko gati dene kii disha main kaam kar rahaa he
 My dear countrymen, now is the time
 ham 21veen sadi main hai
 The largest youth group in the world is in our country
 duniya main hamaari pahchaan IT ke dwaara he, Digital World ke dwaara he
 Will we still remain in the same old thinking? are! ek jamaane main chamade ke sikke chalate the, dhire-dhire lupt ho gaye, koi poochne vaala nahin rahaa
 Today the paper notes are going to be converted into digital currency all the time
 ham netritv karen, ham jimmevary len, ham Digital Transaction kii ore jaaen
 We adopt BHIM APP, become part of economic business
 ham Prepaid ke dwaara bhi kaam karen
 And i am happy that Digital transactions have grown
 pichley saal ke mukaable usamen 34 pratishat kaa ijapha hua he or Prepaid bhugtan main kareeb 44 pratishat kaa
 And that's why we should go ahead with a low cash economy
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, sarkaar kii kuch yojanaayen aisi hai, jo hindustan ke saamaanya maanav kii jeb main paise bachaa saken
 If you put an LED bulb, then a thousand rupees two thousand five thousand rupees of the year are going to save you
 agar aap svachh bharat main safal hote hai, to garib kaa saat hajaar kaa rupaya dawaai kaa band hota he
 Controlling inflation has been successful in curbing your rising expenses, in a way your savings
 ‘jan aushadhi kendron’ ke dwaara sasti dawaai kii dukaan garib ke liye ek bahut bada aashirwad bani he
 The expenses that were behind our operation, behind the stent, have come down
 aane vaale dinon main Knee ke Operation ke liye bhi sari suvidhaayen milengi
 Our effort is to reduce these expenses for the poor and middle class human beings and for that we are taking steps one after the other
 pehle hamaare desh main rajyon ke mukhyalay main Dialysis hua karata tha
 We decided to deliver dialysis to the district centers of India
 kareeb saadhe teen sau, chaar sau jilon tak pahunchaa diya or muft main Dialysis karke garib kii jindagi bachaane kaa kaam ham kar rahe hai
 Today the country can be proud that we have developed our systems in front of the world
 GPS System ke dwaara NAVIC Navigation kii vyavastha aaj karne main ham safal hue hai
 Through SAARC Satellite, we have successfully campaigned to help with neighboring countries
 ham ‘tejas’ hawaii jahaaj ke dwaara aaj duniya ke andar apni ahmiyat pahunchaa rahe hai
 The 'BHIM-AADHAR App' is a wonder within the world for Digital Transaction
 rupay Card 
 
 
 In India, rupay Card is worth crores
 or agar wo operational ho jayega, wo agar garibon ke jeb main he, to duniya kaa, ye sabase bada ho jayega
 And that's why my dear countrymen, i request you to move ahead by taking a pledge for 'new India', and do it in time
 hamaare yahaan shastron main kaha gaya haih aniyat kaal:, aniyat kaalah prabhutayo viplavante, prabhutayo viplavante
 If a task is not completed at the right time, then the desired result is never achieved
 or isaliye ‘team India’ ke liye, sava sau karod deshavaasiyon kii team India ke liye, aaj hamen sankalp lenaa hoga 2022 tak ‘new India’ banane kaa or ye kaam ham khud karenge, koi karegaa aisa nahin, ham khud karenge
 Will do for the country, will do better than before, will do more than before, will do it with dedication, in 2022 to see 'grand-divine' Hindustan
 or isaliye ham sab milakar ke ek aisa bharat banaaenge jahaan garib ke paas pakkaa ghar ho, bijli ho, pani ho
 Together we will create an India where the farmer of the country will sleep peacefully
 aaj wo jitna kama rahaa he, usase 2022 tak doguna kamayega
 Together we will create an India where youth and women will have ample opportunities to fulfill their dreams
 ham sab milakar ke ek aisa bharat banaaenge, jo aatankwaad sampradayawad or jatvaad se mukt hoga
 Together we will create an India where there will be no compromise on corruption and nepotism
 ham sab milakar ke ek aisa bharat banaaenge, jo svachh hoga, swasth hoga or swaraj ke sapane ko puraa karegaa
 And therefore my dear countrymen, we will all try to work together in this race of development
 aaj aazaadee ke 70 saal ke baad, aazaadee ke 75 saal kii pratiksha ke bich paanch saal ke mahatvapurn kaarykaal main ek ‘divya-bhavy bharat’ ke sapane ko lekar ke ham sabhi deshvasi chalem, isi ek bhav ke saath main phir ek baar aazaadee ke diwaanon ko pranaam karata hum
 i salute the new faith, new zeal of 1
25 billion countrymen
 or nae sankalp ke saath aage chalane ke liye ‘team India’ ko aahvaan karata hum
 With this feeling, my heartiest greetings to all of you
 bharat mata kii jai, vande maataram jai hind
 Jai Hind, Jai Hind, Jai Hind, Jai Hind
 bharat mata kii jai, bharat mata kii jai, bharat mata kii jai
 Vande Mataram, Vande Mataram, Vande Mataram, Vande Mataram
 tippaniyan Thank you very much to all
 saabhaar: PIB My dear countrymen, today India's credibility is increasing in the world
 aatankwaad ke khilaaf ladaai, mere deshavaasiyon aapako jaanakar ke khushi hogi aatankwaad ke khilaaf ladaai main aaj ham akele nahin hai
 Many countries of the world are actively helping us
 hawala kaa kaarobaar ho, to duniya hamen jaankaree de rahi he
 Regarding the activities of terrorists, the world is giving us information
 ham vishwa ke saath kandhe se kandhaa milakar ke aatankwaadiyon ke khilaaf ladaai lard rahe hai
 i wish to congratulate all the countries of the world, who are helping us in this work well, increase the prestige of India, and this global relationship is also a part of India's peace and security
 Adding a new dimension, giving a new emphasis
 jammu-kashmir kaa vikaas, jammu-kashmir kii unnati, jammu-kashmir ke saamaanya naagarik ke sapanom ko puraa karne kaa prayaas, ye jammu-kashmir kii sarkaar ke saath-saath, ham deshavaasiyon kaa bhi sankalp he
 Once again we experience this heaven, we are committed to bring it to that position, we are committed
 or isaliye main kahana chahta hum, kashmir ke andar jo kuch bhi hota he, bayaanbaji bhi bahut hoti hai, akshep pratiakshep bhi bahut hote hai, har koi ek duusare ko gaali dene main laga rahata he
 But brothers and sisters, i am clear that whatever happens in Kashmir, the separatists, a handful of separatists, these separatists form new tactics, but to win that battle, the subject is clear in my mind
 ‘na gaali se samasya sulajhane vaali he, na goli se samasya sulajhane vaali he, samasya suljhegi har kashmiri ko gale laga kar ke sulajhane vaali he’ or sava sau karod deshvasi yahi parampara se palaa bada he
 And therefore 'neither abuses nor bullets, change will be embraced' and with that resolve we are moving forward
 aatankwaad ke khilaaf kisi bhi prakaar kii narmi nahin barti jaaegi
 We have repeatedly told the terrorists that you come into the mainstream, in India's democracy, you have every right to talk, the whole system is there
 or mukhyadhara hi he jo har kisi ke jivan main nai urja bhar sakati he
 And that's why i am happy that due to the efforts of our security forces, a large number of young people have surrendered in the area of left-wing Extremism and tried to get into the mainstream
 seemaa kii raksha ke liye hamaare jawan tainaat hai
 i am happy that today the Government of India is launching a website which is the winner of Gallantry Award, the people who will make our country proud, along with their complete information, a portal based on the recipients of a Gallantry Award will also be started today
 It has been so that the new generation of the country can get a lot of information about these brave sacrifices of ours
 Technology kii madad se, desh main eemaandaaree ko bal dene kaa ham logon kaa bharpoor prayaas he
 Our fight against black money will continue
 bhrashtchaar ke khilaaf hamaari ladaai jari rahegi
 And we have gradually made many unsuccessful efforts towards bringing transparency, connecting the AADHAR system by interveneing technology and many people in the world discuss and study this model of India
 sarkaar main bhi kharidi karne main ab chota-sa vyakti bhi hajaaron kilometre dur baitha gaanv kaa vyakti bhi sarkaar ko apana maal supply kar saktaa he, apane product supply kar saktaa he
 He does not need an elder, he does not need a middleman
 GEM naam kaa ek portal banaaya he, GEM uske dwaara government procure kar rahi he
 It has been successful in bringing a lot of transparency
 bhaiyon-bahanon, sarkari kii yojanaon main raftaar badi he
 When the government is delayed in some work, it is not just the project delay
 wo sirf dhan ke kharchen se judaa hua vishay nahin hota he
 When any work gets stuck, stops, then my poor families suffer the most
 mere bhaiyo-bahanon ko hota he
 We can reach Mangalyaan within nine months
 yah hamaara samarthy he
 Mangalyaan can be reached from here within nine months
 lekin maine ek baar sarkaar ke kaam kaa lekha-jokha har maheene letaa rahata hum
 Once such a thing came to my attention, a 42-year-old project, a 70-72 km project, stuck on the rail for 42 years, was hanging
 bhaiyon-bahanon nau maheene main mangalayan pahunchane kaa samarthy rakhane vaala meraa desh 42 saal tak 70-72 kilometre ek rail kii patari na bicha sake, tab garib ke man main sawaal uthta he ki mere desh kaa kya hoga? or aisi chizon par hamane dhyaan diya he
 To change these things, we have tried to bring changes in them by adding all these things, be it the subject of new technology, geo-technology, space-technology
 aapane dekha hoga ek samay tha jab uria ke liye rajya or centre main tanaav chalata tha
 For kerosene, the state and center were tense
 ek aisa maahaul tha, jaise centre bada bhai, rajya chota bhai he
 The direction we worked from day one, because i have been the Chief Minister for a long time, so i know how important states are in the development of the country
 mukhyamantriyon kaa kitna mahatv he, rajyon kii sarkaron kaa kitna mahatv he, isko main bhalee-bhaanti samajhataa hum or isliye Co-operative Federalism or ab Competitive Co-operative Federalism us par hamane bal diya he or aapane dekha hoga ki aaj mil karke saare nirnay, ham mil karke kar rahe hai
 You will remember that from the ramparts of this Red Fort, once the Prime Minister discussed the plight of the power companies of the states of the country
 laal kile par se chintaa vyakt kerani padi thi
 Today, by taking the states together with the 'uday Yojana', by giving strength to the states, these problems were there in the business of the power factories, working together to solve it, this is a great proof of Federalism
 GST ke saath-saath chaahe Smart City ke nirmaan kii baat ho, chaahe swatchta kaa abhiyaan ho, chaahe toilet kii charchaa ho, Ease of doing Business kii baat ho, yah saare vishay aise hai ki hamaare desh ke sabhi rajya kandhe se kandhaa mila karke aaj bharat ke saath bharat kii sarkaar, kandhe se kandhaa mila karke rajya ke saath chalane main bahut safal ho rahi he
 My dear countrymen 'new India' is our greatest strength, democracy
 lekin ham jaanate hai ki hamane loktantr ko mat-patr tak simit kar diya he
 Democracy cannot be limited to ballot papers
 or isliye ham ‘new India’ main us loktantr par bal dena chaahate hai jisamen tantra se lok nahin, lekin logon se tantra chale, aisa loktantr ‘new India’ kii pahchaan bane, us disha main ham janaa chaahate hai
 Lokmanya Tilak ji had said, 'swarajya is my birth right'
 aaazaad bharat me ham sabakaa mantra hona chahie, ‘surajya meraa janmasiddh adhikaar he’
 'state' should be the responsibility of all of us
 naagarik ko apni jimmedaariyaan nibhaani chahie, sarkaron ne apni jimmedaariyaan nibhaani chahie
 When we have to walk from 'swarajya to Surajya', the countrymen do not stay back
 jab maine gas sabsidi chhodane ke liye kaha, desh aage aayaa
 Speaking of cleanliness, even today, in every corner of India, some one is carrying forward the cleanliness drive
 jab notebandi kii baat ai, duniya ko aashcharya hua tha, yahaan tak log kah rahe the, ab modi gaya
 But the patience of the 125 crore countrymen who showed in demonetisation, the faith that they told and the result of that, today we are succeeding in taking steps against corruption
 hamaare desh ke liye is nai lokbhagidaari kii parampara
 
 
 It is our effort to advance the country by public participation
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, laal bahadur shastri ne jai jawan jai kisaan kaa mantra diya tha
 The farmer of our country has never looked back, our farmer is giving record crop production today
 prakritik aapadaaon ke bich main nai–nai siddhiyaan wo hasil kar rahaa he
 There has been a record production of pulses and my dear brothers and sisters, my farmer brothers and sisters, there has never been a tradition of buying pulses in government in India and once in a while, according to thousands of tons It used to be, this time when the farmers of my country produced pulses and served nutritious food to the poor, the government increased this work by doing the historic work of buying 16 lakh tons of pulses Have received
 pradhanmantri fasal beemaa yojana, ek suraksha kavach mere kisaan bhaiyon ko mila he
 Three years ago, only 1
25 crore farmers used to take advantage of this Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, which was earlier known by another name
 aaj pradhanmantri fasal beemaa yojana main itane kam samay main kai naye kisaan iske saath jud gaye hai or kareeb-kareeb ye sankhya aage chalakar ke paune chah karod par pahunchi he
 The Prime Minister Agricultural Irrigation Scheme, if the farmer gets water, has the power to produce gold from the soil and so to provide water to the farmer last time i told the Red Fort, we have completed 21 of those schemes and the rest 50 plans will be completed in the coming time
 or total 99 yojanaon kaa maine sankalp liya he
 We will complete the water supply to the farmer's farm by completing those 99 big plans before 2019
 or kisaan ko beej se bazaar tak, jab tak ham vyastha nahin dete hai, hamaare kisaan ke bhagya ko ham nahin badal sakate hai
 And therefore it needs infrastructure, it needs supply-chain
 har saal lakhon-karodon rupayon kii hamaari sabji, hamaare fal, hamaari fasal barbaad ho jaati he or isliye usko badalane ke liye ek to Foreign Direct Investment ko badhaava diya taaki food processing ke andar duniya hamaare saath jude
 Promoted to create infrastructure and Government of India has implemented 'pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojana'
 jiske kaaran un vyavasthaaon kaa nirmaan kiya jayega jo beej se bazaar tak kisaan ko hand-holding karenge, vyavasthaaen viksit karenge or hamaare karodon kisaanon kii jindagi main ek nayaa badlaav laane main ham safal honge
 Due to Demand and Technology, the nature of job is also changing in our country
 rojgaar se judi yojanaon main, training ke tareeke main 21veen sadi kii aavashyaktaaon ke anusaar, maanav sansaadhan ke vikaas ke liye bharat sarkaar ne anek nai yojanaayen haath main lee hai
 a huge campaign has been launched to ensure that the youth get money from banks without guarantee
 hamaara noujvaan apane pairon par khadaa ho, wo rojgaar paane vaala rahe, rojgaar dene vaala bane, or pichley teen saal main dekha he ki ‘pradhanmantri mudra yojana’ ke kaaran karodon noujvaan apane pairon par khadey hue hai
 Not only this, a young man is also employing one or two to three more people
 shiksha ke kshetra main World Class Universities banane ke liye hamane bandhanon se mukti dene kaa ek bada ahm kadam uthaaya he
 20 Universities have been called upon to decide their fate, Government will not come anywhere
 upar se sarkaar 1000 karod rupee tak kii madad karne ke liye bhi taiyaar he
 Has given a call, i am sure the educational institutions of my country will definitely come forward and make it successful
 pichley teen varsh main 6 IIT, 7 nae IIM, 8 nae IIIT, iskaa nirmaan kiya he or shiksha ko naukari ke avasaron ke saath jodne kaa bhi is ko kaam hamane kiya he
 My mothers, sisters, today, in large quantities, women in the family also go for employment
 or isliye raatri ko bhi unako rojgaar kaa avasar mili, factoriyon main kaam karne kaa avasar mili, isliye Labour Laws main parivartan karne kaa bahut bada ahm kadam uthaaya he
 Our mothers and sisters are also an important unit of the family
 hamaara bhavishya nirmaan karne ke liye hamaari maataaon, bahanon kaa yogadan bahut bada hota he, or isliye Maternity Leave jo 12 saptaah kii thi, wo 26 saptaah, usamen aay chaalu rahegi, is prakaar se dene kaa kaam kiya he
 With regard to the work of empowerment of our women today, in particular, i would like to congratulate the sisters who have been forced to live a very difficult life due to triple talaq
 koi aashray nahin bachaa he, or aisi peedit, teen-talaak se peedit bahanon ne puure desh main ek andolan khadaa kiya he
 The intellectual class of the country was shaken, the media of the country also helped them, an atmosphere was created against triple talaq in the whole country
 is andolan ko chalaane vaali un meri bahanon ko, jo teen-talaak ke khilaaf ladai lard rahi hai, main hriday se unka abhindann karata hum or mujhe vishwaas he, ki maataaon-bahanon ko adhikaar dilaane main, unki is ladaai main hindustan unki puri madad karegaa
 Hindustan will help and it will be successful in this important step of Women Empowerment; i am sure of this
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyo, kabhi-kabhi aasthaa ke naam par dhairya ke abhaav main kuch log aisi chijen kar baithte hai, jo samaaj ke taane-bane ko bikher detii hai
 The country operates with peace, goodwill and unity
 jatvaad kaa jehar, sampradayawad kaa jehar, desh kaa kabhi bhala nahin kar saktaa he
 This is Gandhi's land, Buddha's land, take everyone along and walk; It is part of the culture and tradition of this country
 hamen isko safalataa se aage badhanaa he, or isliye aasthaa ke naam par hinsa ko bal nahin diya ja saktaa he
 If something happens to the patient in the hospital, the hospital is burnt; Accidentally, carts should be burnt; Move, government property be burned; Whose is this for Azad Hindustan? We have assets of 1
25 billion countrymen
 ye saanskrithik viraasat kiski he? ye ham sava sau karod deshavaasiyon kii saanskrithik viraasat he
 Whose faith is this? We are the faith of 125 crore countrymen; And so the path of violence in the name of faith can never go on in this country, this country can never accept
 or isliye main deshavaasiyon se aagrah karuunga, us samay ‘bharat chodo’ kaa naaraa tha, aaj naaraa he ‘bharat jodo’
 We have to take person-to-person, take people-to-people, we have to take every section of the society together, and we have to take the country forward by taking the same
 samrudh bharat banane ke liye hamaari majboot arthvyavastha chahie
 We need balanced development, next generation infrastructure, then we can see the India of our dreams in front of our eyes
 bhaaiyo-bahanon, anginat nirnay hamane teen saal main liye
 Some things have been noted and some things may not have come into notice
 lekin ek baat mahatvapurn he
 When you make such a big change, the stops come, the speed stops
 lekin is sarkaar kii kaaryastylee dekhie, agar train bhi kisi railway stesan ke paas se guzarati he, jab trek badalati he to 60 se chalane vaali speed ko usko 30 kii speed main laana padataa he
 The speed of the train decreases by changing the track
 ham puure desh ko ek nae trek par le jane kaa prayaas kar rahe hai, lekin hamane uski speed kam nahin hone di he, hamane uski gati ko barkaraar rakhaa he
 Whether we bring GST, any law, any new system, we have succeeded in doing that and we will do it in future
 hamane infrastructure par bal diya he
 Unprecedented expenses are being given on infrastructure
 railway stesan kaa aadhunikeekaran ho, chote shahar main, chaahe airport bananaa ho, chaahe water-way kii vyavastha kerani ho, chaahe roadways kii vyavastha kerani ho, chaahe gas grid banani ho, chaahe pani kii grid karaani ho, chaahe optical fibre network karnaa ho, har prakaar ke aadhunik infrastructure par ham purna bal de rahe hai
 My dear countrymen, our eastern India is the most energetic field to advance India in the 21st century
 itnaa potential he, samarthyavan maanav sansaadhan he, apaar prakritik sampada he, parishram ke dhani hai, sankalp karke jindagi badalane kaa samarthy rakhte hai
 Our entire focus is on eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Bengal, Assam, North East, Odisha, these are our powerful states, where natural wealth is abundant, we are trying to take the country to a new height by taking it forward
 bhaaiyo-bahanon, bhrashtachar mukt bharat ek bada ahm kaam he, usko ham bal dene kaa prayaas kar rahe he
 After the formation of the government, the first task was to create SIT
 aaj teen saal ke baad main deshavaasiyon ko bataanaa chahta hum, garv se bataanaa chahta hum ki teen saal ke bheetar-bheetar, kareeb-kareeb sava lakh karod rupye se bhi zyada kalaadhan ko hamane khoj diya he, usko pakadaa he or usko suurender karne ke liye majaboor kiya he
 After that we decided to demonetise
 notebandi ke dwaara hamane anek mahatvapurn safaltaaen praapt kii hai
 The black money that was hidden had to come into the mainstream
 aapane dekha hoga ki ham kabhi 07 din-10 din-15 din badhaate jate the, kabhi petrol pump par, kabhi dawaai kii dukaan par, kabhi railway stesan par puraane note lene kaa silsilaa jari rakhte the, kyonki hamaara prayaas tha ki ek baar jo bhi dhan aae wo bainkon main formal economy kaa hissaa ban jaae or us kaam ko hamane safaltaapurvak paar kiya he
 And the reason for this is that the research that has been done now, is about three lakh crore rupees
 
 
 ye sarkaar ne research nahin kii he, baahar ke expert ne kii he
 Three lakh crore rupees after demonetisation, the additional, which never came back in the banking system, has come
 bainkon main jamaa kii gai raashi main paune do lakh karod se adhik raashi shaq ke ghere main he
 At least two lakh crore rupees of black money has had to reach the banks and now they are forced to give their answers with the system
 nae kaledhan par bhi bahut badi rukaawat aa gai he
 This year, see the result, 56 lakh new taxpayers filing income tax returns from 01 April to 05 August
 pichley saal usee avadhi main ye sankhya sirf 22 lakh thi
 More than double! These reasons are the result of our fight against black money
 18 lakh se zyada aise logon ko pahchaan liya gaya he, jinaki aay unke hisaab kitaab se kuch zyada he, beshumaar zyada he or isaliye is antar kaa unako jawaab dena pad rahaa he
 Out of this, four and a half lakh people have now come to the field, accepting their mistake and trying to get in the way
 ek lakh log aise saamne aae hai, jinhone kabhi jindagi main Income Tax kaa naam bhi nahin suna tha, na Income Tax kabhi diya tha, na kabhi unhone us par sochaa tha, lekin aaj unako wo karnaa pad rahaa he
 Brothers and sisters, if two or four companies are shut down in our country, then there are discussions on them round the clock
 arthniti khatm ho gai


 ye ho gaya, na jane kya kya hota he! aapako jaanakar ke hairaani hogi, kaale dhan ke kaarobaari, Shell companiyaan chalaate the or notebandi ke baad jab data-mining kiya gaya
 Then three lakh such companies have been found, which are just and shell companies only
 hawala kaa kaarobaar karti hai
 Three lakhs, one can imagine
 or usamen se paune do lakh kaa registration hamanen Cancel kar diya he
 If five companies are closed, then there is a storm in India
 paune do lakh companiyon ko taale laga diye
 Those who looted the goods of the country will have to answer, we did this by doing this
 aapako hairaani hogi! kuch to shell companiyaan aisi hai, jo ek hi Address par chaar sau chaar sau companiyaan chal rahi thim, bhaaiyon bahanon
 Four hundred and four hundred companies were operating
 koi dekhne vaala nahin tha, koi poochne vaala nahin tha
 All the collusion was going on
 or isaliye mere bhaaiyon bahanon, maine bhrashtachar kaale dhan ke khilaaf ek bahut badi ladaai chhedi he
 For the betterment of the country, for the welfare of the poor of the country, for the future of the youth of the country
 bhaaiyon bahanon, ek ke baad ek kadam or mujhe vishwaas he GST ke baad usamen or badhotaree hone vaali he
 And Transparency is forthcoming
 akele Transportation hamaara trek vaala ek sthaan se duusare sthaan par jaataa tha
 After this GST, thirty percent of his time is saved
 check-post khatm hone ke kaaran hajaaron karod rupayon kii to bachat hui he
 The biggest savings have been time
 ek prakaar se uski tees pratishat Efficiency bad rahi he
 You can imagine what it means to increase thirty percent efficiency in the transport world of India
 ek GST ke kaaran itnaa bada parivartan aayaa he
 My dear countrymen, today money has come to banks due to demonetisation
 bank apni byaaj dar kam kar rahe hai
 The common man is getting money from the bank through currency
 saamaanya maanav ko apane pairon par khadey hone ke liye avasar mil rahaa he
 Be poor, a middle class person wants to build a house, then banks are coming forward to help him, coming at a lower rate of interest
 ye sara desh ke arthtantr ko gati dene kii disha main kaam kar rahaa he
 My dear countrymen, now is the time
 ham 21veen sadi main hai
 The largest youth group in the world is in our country
 duniya main hamaari pahchaan IT ke dwaara he, Digital World ke dwaara he
 Will we still remain in the same old thinking? are! ek jamaane main chamade ke sikke chalate the, dhire-dhire lupt ho gaye, koi poochne vaala nahin rahaa
 Today the paper notes are going to be converted into digital currency all the time
 ham netritv karen, ham jimmevary len, ham Digital Transaction kii ore jaaen
 We adopt BHIM APP, become part of economic business
 ham Prepaid ke dwaara bhi kaam karen
 And i am happy that Digital transactions have grown
 pichley saal ke mukaable usamen 34 pratishat kaa ijapha hua he or Prepaid bhugtan main kareeb 44 pratishat kaa
 And that's why we should go ahead with a low cash economy
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, sarkaar kii kuch yojanaayen aisi hai, jo hindustan ke saamaanya maanav kii jeb main paise bachaa saken
 If you put an LED bulb, then a thousand rupees two thousand five thousand rupees of the year are going to save you
 agar aap svachh bharat main safal hote hai, to garib kaa saat hajaar kaa rupaya dawaai kaa band hota he
 Controlling inflation has been successful in curbing your rising expenses, in a way your savings
 ‘jan aushadhi kendron’ ke dwaara sasti dawaai kii dukaan garib ke liye ek bahut bada aashirwad bani he
 The expenses that were behind our operation, behind the stent, have come down
 aane vaale dinon main Knee ke Operation ke liye bhi sari suvidhaayen milengi
 Our effort is to reduce these expenses for the poor and middle class human beings and for that we are taking steps one after the other
 pehle hamaare desh main rajyon ke mukhyalay main Dialysis hua karata tha
 We decided to deliver dialysis to the district centers of India
 kareeb saadhe teen sau, chaar sau jilon tak pahunchaa diya or muft main Dialysis karke garib kii jindagi bachaane kaa kaam ham kar rahe hai
 Today the country can be proud that we have developed our systems in front of the world
 GPS System ke dwaara NAVIC Navigation kii vyavastha aaj karne main ham safal hue hai
 Through SAARC Satellite, we have successfully campaigned to help with neighboring countries
 ham ‘tejas’ hawaii jahaaj ke dwaara aaj duniya ke andar apni ahmiyat pahunchaa rahe hai
 The 'BHIM-AADHAR App' is a wonder within the world for Digital Transaction
 rupay Card 
 
 
 In India, rupay Card is worth crores
 or agar wo operational ho jayega, wo agar garibon ke jeb main he, to duniya kaa, ye sabase bada ho jayega
 And that's why my dear countrymen, i request you to move ahead by taking a pledge for 'new India', and do it in time
 hamaare yahaan shastron main kaha gaya haih aniyat kaal:, aniyat kaalah prabhutayo viplavante, prabhutayo viplavante
 If a task is not completed at the right time, then the desired result is never achieved
 or isaliye ‘team India’ ke liye, sava sau karod deshavaasiyon kii team India ke liye, aaj hamen sankalp lenaa hoga 2022 tak ‘new India’ banane kaa or ye kaam ham khud karenge, koi karegaa aisa nahin, ham khud karenge
 Will do for the country, will do better than before, will do more than before, will do it with dedication, in 2022 to see 'grand-divine' Hindustan
 or isaliye ham sab milakar ke ek aisa bharat banaaenge jahaan garib ke paas pakkaa ghar ho, bijli ho, pani ho
 Together we will create an India where the farmer of the country will sleep peacefully
 aaj wo jitna kama rahaa he, usase 2022 tak doguna kamayega
 Together we will create an India where youth and women will have ample opportunities to fulfill their dreams
 ham sab milakar ke ek aisa bharat banaaenge, jo aatankwaad sampradayawad or jatvaad se mukt hoga
 Together we will create an India where there will be no compromise on corruption and nepotism
 ham sab milakar ke ek aisa bharat banaaenge, jo svachh hoga, swasth hoga or swaraj ke sapane ko puraa karegaa
 And therefore my dear countrymen, we will all try to work together in this race of development
 aaj aazaadee ke 70 saal ke baad, aazaadee ke 75 saal kii pratiksha ke bich paanch saal ke mahatvapurn kaarykaal main ek ‘divya-bhavy bharat’ ke sapane ko lekar ke ham sabhi deshvasi chalem, isi ek bhav ke saath main phir ek baar aazaadee ke diwaanon ko pranaam karata hum
 i salute the new faith, new zeal of 1
25 billion countrymen
 or nae sankalp ke saath aage chalane ke liye ‘team India’ ko aahvaan karata hum
 With this feeling, my heartiest greetings to all of you
 bharat mata kii jai, vande maataram jai hind

 saabhaar: PIB The development of Jammu and Kashmir, the progress of Jammu and Kashmir, the effort to fulfill the dreams of ordinary citizens of Jammu and Kashmir, along with the Government of Jammu and Kashmir, we also have the resolve of our countrymen
 phir se ek baar is swarg ko ham anubhav karen, us sthiti main laane ke liye ham patibaddh hai, ham katibaddh hai
 And that's why i want to say, whatever happens inside Kashmir, there is too much rhetoric, there are also a lot of attacks and attacks, everyone keeps on abusing each other
 lekin bhaaiyon bahanon, main saaf maanata hum ki kashmir main jo kuch bhi ghatnaayen ghatati hai, algaavvaadi, mutthibhar algaavvaadi, ye algaavvaadi jis prakaar ke naye-naye pantare rachate rahete hai, lekin us ladaai ko jeetne ke liye mere dimag main vishay saaf he
 'neither the problem is going to be solved by abuses, nor the problem is solved by the bullet, the problem will be solved by embracing every Kashmiri' and this one hundred and twenty crores countrymen have grown up from this tradition
 or isaliye ‘na gaali se na goli se, parivartan hoga gale lagaakar ke’ or us sankalp ko lekar ke ham aage bad rahe hai
 No softness will be taken against terrorism
 aatankwaadiyon ko baar - baar hamane kaha he ki aap mukhyadhara main aaiye bharat ke loktantr main aapako baat karne ke liye puraa adhikaar he, puri vyavastha he
 And it is the mainstream that can fill new energy in everyone's life
 or isaliye mujhe khushi he ki hamaare surakshabalon ke prayaason se kar ke left-wing Extremism ke ilaake main bahut badi sankhya main noujvaan waapas aae surrender kiye mukhyadhara main aane kii disha main unhone prayaas kiya
 Our soldiers are deployed to protect the border
 mujhe khushi he ki aaj bharat sarkaar ek aisi website launch kar rahi he, jo Gallantry Award vijeta he, hamaare desh ko gaurav dilaane vaale log hai, unki puri jaankariyon ke saath aaj ek Gallantry Award praapt karne waalon par aadhaarit ek Portal bhi prarambh kiya ja rahaa he, jisase desh kii nai peedi ko hamaare in vir balidaniyon ke bare main bahut sari jaankariyaan praapt ho sakati hai
 With the help of technology, we have made every effort to strengthen honesty in the country
 kaledhan ke khilaaf hamaari ladaai jari rahegi
 Our fight against corruption will continue
 or hamane dhire-dhire Technology ko intervene karte hue AADHAR kii vyavastha ko jodate hue, transparency laane kii disha main anek vidd-safal prayaas kiye hai or duniya ke anek log bharat ke is model kii charchaa bhi karte hai or uskaa adhyayan bhi karte hai
 Now, even a small person sitting in the government, thousands of kilometers away, can also supply his goods and supply his products to the government
 usko bade kii jarurat nahin he, bichauliye kii jarurat nahin he
 a portal named GEM has been created, GEM is doing government procurement by him
 bahut sari maatra main transparency laane main safalataa mili he
 Ladies & Gentlemen, the speed of government schemes has increased
 jab sarkaar, kisi kaam main vilamb ho jaataa he, to sirf wo project vilamb nahin hota
 It is not just a matter related to the expenditure of money
 jab koi bhi kaam atak jaataa he, ruuk jaataa he to sabase zyada nuksaan mere garib pariwaron ko hota he
 My brothers and sisters
 ham nau maheene ke bheetar-bheetar mangalayan pahunch sakate hai
 This is our strength
 nau maheene ke bheetar-bheetar yahaan se mangalayan pahunch sakate hai
 But once every month i keep an account of the work of the government
 ek baar aisi baat mere dhyaan main ai, 42 saal purana ek project, 70-72 kilometre kaa project, rail kaa 42 saal se atka padaa, lataka padaa tha
 Brothers and sisters, my country, which has the ability to reach Mangalyaan in nine months, cannot lay a rail track for 70-72 kilometers for 42 years, then the question arises in the mind of the poor that what will happen to my country? And we have focused on such things
 in chizon main badlaav laane ke liye hamane nai-nai technology geo-technology kaa vishay ho, space-technology kaa vishay ho in sari chizon ko jod karke hamane usamen parivartan laane kaa prayaas kiya he
 You must have seen a time when there was tension in the state and center for urea
 kerosene ke liye rajya or centre ke liye tanaav chalata tha
 There was an atmosphere like the center is the elder brother, the state is the younger brother
 hamane pehle din se jis disha main kaam kiya, kyonki lambe arase se mukhyamantri rahaa hum, isliye mujhe pataa he ki desh ke vikaas main rajyon kii kitni ahmiyat he
 i understand the importance of the Chief Ministers, how important the Governments of the States are, and therefore Co-operative Federalism and now Competitive Co-operative Federalism we have emphasized that and you must have seen that today all the decisions together , We are doing it together
 aapako yaad hoga isi lalakile kii pracheer se ek baar desh ke rajyo kii bijli companiyon kii durdasha kii charchaa ek pradhanmantri ne kii thi
 Had to worry about the Red Fort
 aaj hamane rajyon ko saath le kar ke ‘udai yojana’ ke dwaara rajyon ko takat de karke us bijli ke kaarkaanon ke kaarobaar main yah samasyaayein thi, uskaa samaadhaan kaa kaam mil karke kiya, yah Federalism kaa ek bahut bada saboot he
 Along with the GST, whether it is about the construction of Smart City, whether it is a campaign for cleanliness, whether it is a discussion of toilet, ease of doing business, all these subjects are such that all the states of our country join shoulder to shoulder
 Today, the Government of India is being very successful in running shoulder to shoulder with the state
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyon ‘new India’ hamaari sabase badi takat he, loktantr he
 But we know that we have limited democracy to the ballot paper
 loktantr mat-patr tak simit nahin ho saktaa
 And that is why we want to emphasize on democracy in 'new India' in which the system is not public, but the people should have the system, so that democracy should become the identity of 'new India', we want to go in that direction
 lokmaanya tilak ji ne kaha tha, ‘swarajya meraa janmasiddh adhikaar he’
 The mantra of all of us in independent India should be, 'state is my rightful birth'
 ‘surajya’ ham sabakaa daayitv hona chahie
 Citizens should carry out their responsibilities, governments should fulfill their responsibilities
 ‘swarajya se surajya’ kii ore jab chalanaa he, to deshvasi peeche nahin rahete
 When i asked to give up the gas subsidy, the country came forward
 swatchta kii baat kahi, aaj bhi hindustan ke har kone main koi na koi swatchta ke abhiyaan ko aage badha rahaa he
 When it came to demonetisation, the world was surprised, even people were saying, now Modi has gone
 lekin notebandi main sava sau karod deshavaasiyon ne jis dhairya ko dikhaaya, jis vishwaas ko bataaya or usee kaa parinaam he ki aaj bhrashtachar ke khilaaf nakel lagane main ham ek ke baad kadam uthaane main safal ho rahe hai
 This new tradition of public participation for our country
 
 
 janabhagidaari se hi desh ko aage badhaane main hamaara prayaas he
 My dear countrymen, Lal Bahadur Shastri gave the mantra of Jai Jawan Jai Kisan
 hamaare desh ke kisaan ne peeche mud ke kabhi dekha nahin, record fasal utpaadan aaj hamaara kisaan karke de rahaa he
 In the midst of natural disasters, he is getting new achievements
 daal kaa record utpaadan hua he or mere pyaare bhaiyo bahanon, mere kisaan bhaiyo bahanon, hindustan main kabhi bhi sarkaar main daal kharidne kii parampara hi nahin rahi he or kabhi ek-aadh baar kiya ho to hajaaron main hi hajaaron ton ke hisaab ke hisaab se hota tha, is baar jab mere desh ke kisaanon ne daal utpaadan karke garib ko paushtik aahaar dene kaa kaam kiya, to 16 lakh ton daal, sarkaar ne kharidne kaa aitihaasik kaam karke is kaam ko badhaava diya
 Prime Minister Crop Insurance Scheme, a security shield has been provided to my farmer brothers
 teen saal pehle sirf sava teen karod kisaan is pradhanmantri fasal beemaa yojana, jo pehle duusare naam se chalati thi uskaa laabh lete the
 Today, in such a short time under the Prime Minister Crop Insurance Scheme, many new farmers have joined with it and almost these numbers have reached a further six crores
 pradhanmantri krishi sinchai yojana, kisaan ko agar pani mili to mitti main se sona paidaa karne kii takat rakhata he or isliye kisaan ko pani pahunchane ke liye maine pichhali baar lalakile se kaha tha, un yojaanaaon main se 21 yojana ham purna kar chuke hai or baaki 50 yojanaayen aane vaale kuch samay main purna ho jaaengi
 And i have resolved a total of 99 schemes
 2019 ke pehle un 99 badi-bady yojanaayen ko paripurna karke, kisaan ke khet tak pani pahunchane kaa kaam ham purna kar denge
 And we cannot change the fate of our farmer till we provide for the farmer from seed to market
 or isliye uske liye infrastructure chahie, uske liye supply-chain chahie
 Every year our vegetables, our fruits, our crops worth millions and billions are wasted and so to change that, one has encouraged Foreign Direct Investment so that the world can join us in food processing
 Infrastructure banane ke liye badhaava diya or bharat sarkaar ne ‘pradhanmantri kisaan sampada yojana’ lagu kii he
 Due to which arrangements will be made that will hand-hold the farmer from seed to market, develop systems and we will be successful in bringing a new change in the lives of our crores of farmers
 Demand or Technology ke kaaran, hamaare desh main nature of job main bhi bahut bada badlaav aa rahaa he
 In employment related schemes, according to the requirements of 21st century in the way of training, the Government of India has taken up many new schemes for the development of human resources
 naujavaanon ko bina guarantee bainkon se paisa mili iske liye bahut bada abhiyaan chalaaya he
 Our youth should stand on their feet, they should get employment, become employable, and in the last three years we have seen that due to 'pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana', crores of youth have stood on their feet
 itnaa hi nahin, ek noujvaan ek yaa do teen or logon ko bhi rojgaar de rahaa he
 To create World Class Universities in the field of education, we have taken a major step to break free from bondage
 20 uniwarsitiyon kaa aahvaan kiya he ki aap apane bhagya kaa faisla kiijie, sarkaar kahin bich main nahin aegi
 From above the government is also ready to help up to 1000 crores rupees
 aahvaan kiya he, mujhe vishwaas he mere desh kii shiksha sansthaaon main jarur aage aaenge, isko safal karenge
 In the last three years, 6 iits, 7 new iims, 8 new iiits have been built, and we have also done this work to link education with job opportunities
 meri maatayen, bahanen aaj bahut badi maatra main, parivaar main mahilaayein bhi rojgaar ke liye jaati hai
 And so at night, they get employment opportunities, work in factories, so have taken a very important step to change Labor Laws
 hamaari maatayen, bahanen parivaar kii bhi ek ahm ikai hai
 The contribution of our mothers and sisters is huge to build our future, and so Maternity Leave, which was 12 weeks, will continue to have income in 26 weeks, thus giving has worked

 i heartily congratulate my sisters who are fighting this movement against the triple talaq, and i am sure that in helping them in their fight for the empowerment of mothers and sisters, Will do
 hindustan puri madad karegaa or Women Empowerment ke is mahatvapurn kadam main wo safal hoke rahegi; aisa mujhe puraa bharosa he
 My dear countrymen, sometimes in the name of faith, in the absence of patience some people do such things, which spoil the fabric of society
 desh shanti, sadbhaavna or ekta se chalata he
 The poison of casteism, the poison of communalism, can never benefit the country
 ye to gandhi kii bhoomi he, buddha kii bhoomi he, sabko saath le karke chalanaa; ye is desh kii samskruti or parampara kaa hissaa he
 We have to carry it forward successfully, and hence violence cannot be stressed in the name of faith
 aspataal main to patient ke saath kuch ho jaae, aspataal jala diya jaae; aksmaat ho jaae, gaadiyaan jala diya jaaen; andolan karen, sarkari sampatti ko jala diya jaae; aaazaad hindustan ke liye ye kiskaa he? hamaare sava sau karod deshavaasiyon kii sampatti he
 Whose cultural heritage is this? This is the cultural heritage of 1
25 billion countrymen
 ye aasthaa kiski he? ham sava sau karod deshavaasiyon kii aasthaa he; or isliye aasthaa ke naam par hinsa kaa rasta, is desh main kabhi bhi chal nahin saktaa, yah desh kabhi sweekaar nahin kar saktaa he
 And so i will urge the countrymen, at that time there was the slogan 'quit India', today the slogan is 'add India'
 vyakti-vyakti ko hamane saath lenaa he, jan-jan ko saath lenaa he, samaaj ke har tabake ko saath lenaa he, or usee ko le karke hamen desh ko aage badhanaa he
 We need a strong economy to build a prosperous India
 santulit vikaas chahie, next generation infrastructure chahie, tab ja kar ke hamaare sapanom ke bharat ko ham apni ankhon ke saamne dekh sakate hai
 Brothers and sisters, we have taken countless decisions in three years
 kuch chizon ko notice kiya gaya he or kuch chijen shaayad notice main nahin ai
 But one thing is important
 jab aap itnaa bada badlaav karte he to rukvaaten aati hai, gati ruk jaati he
 But see the working style of this government, if the train also passes near a railway station, when the track changes, the speed running from 60 has to be brought to the speed of 30
 trek badalane par train kii speed kam ho jaati he
 We are trying to take the whole country to a new track, but we have not let his speed down, we have kept his pace
 chaahe GST laaen ho, koi bhi kanoon laaen ho, koi bhi nai vyavastha laae ho, ham usko karne main safal hue he or aage bhi isko ham karenge
 We have laid emphasis on infrastructure
 abhootpurv kharch infrastructure par die ja rahe hai
 The railway station should be modernized, in a small town, whether to build an airport, whether to arrange water-way, whether to arrange roadways, whether to build gas grid, whether to grid water, whether to do optical fiber network , We are giving full emphasis on all types of modern infrastructure
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, 21veen sadi main bharat ko aage badhaane kaa sabase urjavan kshetra he, hamaara purvi hindustan
 There is so much potential, powerful human resource, immense natural wealth, rich of hard work, and ability to change life by resolving
 hamaara puraa dhyaan purvi uttar pradesh, bihar, bengal, assam, north east, odisha, ye hamaare aise samarthyavan rajya hai, jahaan prakritik sampada bharpoor he, usko aage badhaakar ke desh ko ek nai oonchai par le jane kii disha main ham prayatnrat he
 Brothers and sisters, corruption-free India is a very important task, we are trying to strengthen it
 sarkaar banane ke baad pehla kaam kiya tha SIT banane kaa
 Today, after three years, i want to tell the countrymen, proudly tell them that within three years, we have discovered more than about 1
25 lakh crore rupees of black money, caught it and suurender it
 Is forced
 uske baad hamane notebandi kaa faisla kiya
 We have achieved many significant successes through demonetisation
 jo kalaadhan chipa hua tha, usko mukhyadhara main aana padaa
 You must have seen that we sometimes used to extend 07 days-10 days-15 days, sometimes at the petrol pump, sometimes at the drugstore, sometimes at the railway station, we continued to take old notes, because our effort was once Money should also become a part of the formal economy in the banks and we have successfully completed that work
 or iskaa kaaran yah hua he ki abhi jo research hua he, kareeb teen lakh karod rupye
 
 
 This government has not done research, outside experts have done it
 notebandi ke baad teen lakh karod rupye, jo atirikt, jo kabhi banking system main waapas nahin aata tha wo aayaa he
 More than a quarter of a million rupees in the amount deposited in banks is under suspicion
 kam se kam do lakh karod rupye se zyada kalaadhan usko bainko tak pahunchnaa padaa he or ab vyavastha ke saath unako apana jawaab dene ke liye majaboor hue hai
 The new black money has also come to a great halt
 is varsh, iskaa parinaam dekhie, 01 april se 05 agast tak income tax return daakhil karne vaale nae vyaktigat karadaataaon kii sankhya 56 lakh
 In the same period last year, this number was only 2
2 million
 Double se bhi zyada! ye kaaran kaledhan ke khilaaf hamaari ladaai kaa parinaam he
 More than 18 lakh people have been identified, whose income is more than the book according to them, they are uncountable and hence they have to answer this difference
 saadhe chaar lakh log isamen se ab maidan main aaye hai, apni galati sweekaar karke raste main aane kaa prayaas kar rahe hai
 One lakh people have come forward, who had never heard of income tax in life, nor had ever given income tax, nor had they thought of it, but today they have to do it
 bhaaiyon bahanon, hamaare desh main agar do chaar companiyaan bhi kahin band ho jaae, to choubison ghante us par charchaaen hoti hai us par Debates hoti hai
 Economy is over


 it is done, no matter what happens! You'd be surprised to know, black money traders, Shell used to run companies and after demonetisation when data-mining was done
 tab teen lakh aisi companiyaan pai gayi hai, jo sirf or sirf shell companiyaan hai
 Does hawala business
 teen lakh, koi kalpana kar saktaa he
 And we have canceled the registration of one and a half lakh from that
 paanch companiyaan band ho jaae to hindustan main tufaan much jaataa he
 Locked up to twenty two lakh companies
 desh kaa maal luutane waalon ko jawaab dena padegaa, ye kaam hamane kar ke dikhaaya
 You will be surprised! Some shell companies are such that four hundred and four hundred companies were running at the same address, brothers and sisters
 chaar sau chaar sau companiyaan chal rahi thim
 Nobody was going to see, nobody was going to ask
 sari mileebhagat chal rahi thi
 And so my brothers and sisters, i have waged a very big fight against corruption black money
 desh kii bhalaai ke liye desh ke garibon ke kalyaan ke liye, desh ke naujavaanon ke bhavishya ko banane ke liye
 Brothers and sisters, one step after the other, and i am sure it will increase further after GST
 or Transparency aane vaali he
 Transportation alone Our truck used to go from one place to another
 ye GST ke baad tees pratishat uskaa samay batch gaya he
 Thousands of crores of rupees have been saved due to the end of check-post
 sabase badi bachat samay kii hui he
 In a way, its thirty percent efficiency is increasing
 aap kalpana kar sakate hai hindustan ke Transport jagat main tees pratishat Efficiency badhane kaa matlab kya hota he
 a GST has brought about such a big change
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, aaj notebandi ke kaaran bainko ke paas dhan aayaa he
 Banks are reducing their interest rate
 mudra ke dwaara saamaanya maanav ko bank se paisa mil rahaa he
 The common man is getting an opportunity to stand on his feet
 garib ho, madhyavarg kaa vyakti ho ghar bananaa chahta he, to bank usko madad karne ke liye aage aa rahe hai, kam byaaj kii dar se aage aa rahe hai
 It is working towards accelerating the economy of the country
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, ab ye vakt badal chukaa he
 We are in the 21st century
 vishwa kaa sabase bada yuva varg hamaare desh main he
 Our identity in the world is by IT, by Digital World
 kya ab bhi ham usee pooraani soch main rahenge
 Hey! Once upon a time, leather coins used to move, slowly disappeared, no one was asking
 aaj jo kaagaj ke note hai, samay aate rahete wo sara kaa sara Digital Currency main Convert hone vaala he
 Let us lead, let us take responsibility, let us go towards Digital Transaction
 ham BHIM APP ko apanaaen, aarthik kaarobaar kaa hissaa banaaen
 We also work through Prepaid
 or mujhe khushi he ki Digital lenden badi he
 It has increased by 34 percent over the previous year and about 44 percent in prepaid payments
 or isaliye kam cash vaali arthvyavastha, usko lekar ke hamen aage badhanaa chahie
 My dear countrymen, there are some schemes of the government that can save money in the pockets of the common man of India
 agar aap LED Bulb lagaate hai, to saal bhar kaa hajaar do hajaar paanch hajaar rupaya aapkaa bachane vaala he
 If you succeed in a clean India, then the poor's medicine of seven thousand rupees stops
 mahangaai par niyantran, aapke badhate hue kharch ko rokane main safal hua he, ek prakaar se aapaki bachat he
 Affordable medicine shops have become a huge blessing for the poor through 'jan Aushadhi Kendras'
 hamaare yahaan Operation ke peeche, stent ke peeche jo kharch hote the wo kam hue hai
 In the coming days, all facilities will also be available for Knee's operation
 hamaari koshish he ki garib or madhyamvarg ke maanav ke liye ye kharch kam ho or uske liye ham ek ke baad ek kadam uthaa rahe hai
 Earlier, dialysis used to take place in the headquarters of the states in our country
 hamane tay kiya hindustan ke jila kendron tak Dialysis pahunchaayenge
 Nearly three and a half hundred and four hundred districts have been reached and by dialysis for free, we are working to save the life of the poor
 aaj desh garv kar saktaa he ki hamane vishwa ke saamne apni vyavasthaaon ko viksit kiya he
 Today we have succeeded in arranging NAVIC Navigation through GPS System
 hamane SAARC Satellite ke dwaara hamane padosi deshon ke saath madad karne kaa safal abhiyaan kiya he
 We are delivering our importance inside the world today by 'tejas' airplane
 ‘BHIM-AADHAR App’ duniya ke andar Digital Transaction ke liye ek ajooba bana hua he
 rupay Card
 
 
 hindustan main rupay Card karodon kii taadaad main he
 And if it becomes operational, if it is in the pocket of the poor, then it will become the largest in the world
 or isaliye mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, meraa aapse yahi aagrah he ki ham ‘new India’ kaa sankalp le kar ke aage badhen, samay rahete hue karen
 It is said in our scriptures: Aniyat Kaal: Aniyat Kaal: Prabhutyo Viplavante, Prabhutayo Viplavante
 sahi samay par agar koi kaary puraa nahin kiya gaya, to phir icchit parinaam kabhi nahin milte hai
 And so for 'team India', for Team India of 1
25 billion countrymen, today we have to pledge to make 'new India' by 2022 and we will do this work ourselves, no one will do it, we will do it ourselves
 desh ke liye karenge, pehle se acha karenge, pehle se zyada karenge, samarpan bhav se karenge, 2022 main ‘bhavy-divya’ hindustan dekhne ke liye karenge
 And that's why we will all together create an India where the poor have a pucca house, electricity, water
 ham sab milakar ek aisa bharat banaaenge, jahaan desh kaa kisaan chintaa main nahin chaiyn se soyega
 By 2022, he will earn twice as much as he is earning today
 ham sab milakar ke ek aisa hindustan banaaenge, jahaan yuvaaon, mahilaon ko apane sapane puure karne ke liye bharpoor avasar uplabdh honge
 Together we will create an India that will be free from terrorism, communalism and casteism
 ham sab milakar ke ek aisa bharat banaaenge, jahaan bhrashtachar or bhai-bhatijawad se koi samjhauta nahin hoga
 Together we will create an India that will be clean, healthy and fulfill the dream of Swaraj
 or isaliye mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, ham sab milakar ke vikaas kii is daud main aage chalane kaa prayaas karenge
 Today, after 70 years of independence, in the midst of waiting for 75 years of independence, in the important tenure of five years, all of us countrymen should go with the dream of a 'divine-grand India', with this same sentiment i once again i bow to the crazy people
 sava sau karod deshavaasiyon ke nae vishwaas, nai umang ko naman karata hum
 And call upon 'team India' to move forward with a new resolution
 isi bhaavana ke saath aap sabko hriday se meri bahut bahut shubhakamanaayen
 Bharat Mata Ki Jai, Vande Mataram Jai Hind
 jai hind, jai hind, jai hind, jai hind
 Bharat Mata Ki Jai, Bharat Mata Ki Jai, Bharat Mata Ki Jai

 The comments sabhi kaa bahut bahut dhanyavad
 Sincerely: PIB aatankwaad ke khilaaf kisi bhi prakaar kii narmi nahin barti jaaegi
 We have repeatedly told the terrorists that you come into the mainstream, in India's democracy, you have every right to talk, the whole system is there
 or mukhyadhara hi he jo har kisi ke jivan main nai urja bhar sakati he
 And that's why i am happy that due to the efforts of our security forces, a large number of young people have surrendered in the area of left-wing Extremism and tried to get into the mainstream
 seemaa kii raksha ke liye hamaare jawan tainaat hai
 i am happy that today the Government of India is launching a website which is the winner of Gallantry Award, the people who will make our country proud, along with their complete information, a portal based on the recipients of a Gallantry Award will also be started today
 It has been so that the new generation of the country can get a lot of information about these brave sacrifices of ours
 Technology kii madad se, desh main eemaandaaree ko bal dene kaa ham logon kaa bharpoor prayaas he
 Our fight against black money will continue
 bhrashtchaar ke khilaaf hamaari ladaai jari rahegi
 And we have gradually made many unsuccessful efforts towards bringing transparency, connecting the AADHAR system by interveneing technology and many people in the world discuss and study this model of India
 sarkaar main bhi kharidi karne main ab chota-sa vyakti bhi hajaaron kilometre dur baitha gaanv kaa vyakti bhi sarkaar ko apana maal supply kar saktaa he, apane product supply kar saktaa he
 He does not need an elder, he does not need a middleman
 GEM naam kaa ek portal banaaya he, GEM uske dwaara government procure kar rahi he
 It has been successful in bringing a lot of transparency
 bhaiyon-bahanon, sarkari kii yojanaon main raftaar badi he
 When the government is delayed in some work, it is not just the project delay
 wo sirf dhan ke kharchen se judaa hua vishay nahin hota he
 When any work gets stuck, stops, then my poor families suffer the most
 mere bhaiyo-bahanon ko hota he
 We can reach Mangalyaan within nine months
 yah hamaara samarthy he
 Mangalyaan can be reached from here within nine months
 lekin maine ek baar sarkaar ke kaam kaa lekha-jokha har maheene letaa rahata hum
 Once such a thing came to my attention, a 42-year-old project, a 70-72 km project, stuck on the rail for 42 years, was hanging
 bhaiyon-bahanon nau maheene main mangalayan pahunchane kaa samarthy rakhane vaala meraa desh 42 saal tak 70-72 kilometre ek rail kii patari na bicha sake, tab garib ke man main sawaal uthta he ki mere desh kaa kya hoga? or aisi chizon par hamane dhyaan diya he
 To change these things, we have tried to bring changes in them by adding all these things, be it the subject of new technology, geo-technology, space-technology
 aapane dekha hoga ek samay tha jab uria ke liye rajya or centre main tanaav chalata tha
 For kerosene, the state and center were tense
 ek aisa maahaul tha, jaise centre bada bhai, rajya chota bhai he
 The direction we worked from day one, because i have been the Chief Minister for a long time, so i know how important states are in the development of the country
 mukhyamantriyon kaa kitna mahatv he, rajyon kii sarkaron kaa kitna mahatv he, isko main bhalee-bhaanti samajhataa hum or isliye Co-operative Federalism or ab Competitive Co-operative Federalism us par hamane bal diya he or aapane dekha hoga ki aaj mil karke saare nirnay, ham mil karke kar rahe hai
 You will remember that from the ramparts of this Red Fort, once the Prime Minister discussed the plight of the power companies of the states of the country
 laal kile par se chintaa vyakt kerani padi thi
 Today, by taking the states together with the 'uday Yojana', by giving strength to the states, these problems were there in the business of the power factories, working together to solve it, this is a great proof of Federalism
 GST ke saath-saath chaahe Smart City ke nirmaan kii baat ho, chaahe swatchta kaa abhiyaan ho, chaahe toilet kii charchaa ho, Ease of doing Business kii baat ho, yah saare vishay aise hai ki hamaare desh ke sabhi rajya kandhe se kandhaa mila karke aaj bharat ke saath bharat kii sarkaar, kandhe se kandhaa mila karke rajya ke saath chalane main bahut safal ho rahi he
 My dear countrymen 'new India' is our greatest strength, democracy
 lekin ham jaanate hai ki hamane loktantr ko mat-patr tak simit kar diya he
 Democracy cannot be limited to ballot papers
 or isliye ham ‘new India’ main us loktantr par bal dena chaahate hai jisamen tantra se lok nahin, lekin logon se tantra chale, aisa loktantr ‘new India’ kii pahchaan bane, us disha main ham janaa chaahate hai
 Lokmanya Tilak ji had said, 'swarajya is my birth right'
 aaazaad bharat me ham sabakaa mantra hona chahie, ‘surajya meraa janmasiddh adhikaar he’
 'state' should be the responsibility of all of us
 naagarik ko apni jimmedaariyaan nibhaani chahie, sarkaron ne apni jimmedaariyaan nibhaani chahie
 When we have to walk from 'swarajya to Surajya', the countrymen do not stay back
 jab maine gas sabsidi chhodane ke liye kaha, desh aage aayaa
 Speaking of cleanliness, even today, in every corner of India, some one is carrying forward the cleanliness drive
 jab notebandi kii baat ai, duniya ko aashcharya hua tha, yahaan tak log kah rahe the, ab modi gaya
 But the patience of the 125 crore countrymen who showed in demonetisation, the faith that they told and the result of that, today we are succeeding in taking steps against corruption
 hamaare desh ke liye is nai lokbhagidaari kii parampara
 
 
 It is our effort to advance the country by public participation
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, laal bahadur shastri ne jai jawan jai kisaan kaa mantra diya tha
 The farmer of our country has never looked back, our farmer is giving record crop production today
 prakritik aapadaaon ke bich main nai–nai siddhiyaan wo hasil kar rahaa he
 There has been a record production of pulses and my dear brothers and sisters, my farmer brothers and sisters, there has never been a tradition of buying pulses in government in India and once in a while, according to thousands of tons It used to be, this time when the farmers of my country produced pulses and served nutritious food to the poor, the government increased this work by doing the historic work of buying 16 lakh tons of pulses Have received
 pradhanmantri fasal beemaa yojana, ek suraksha kavach mere kisaan bhaiyon ko mila he
 Three years ago, only 1
25 crore farmers used to take advantage of this Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, which was earlier known by another name
 aaj pradhanmantri fasal beemaa yojana main itane kam samay main kai naye kisaan iske saath jud gaye hai or kareeb-kareeb ye sankhya aage chalakar ke paune chah karod par pahunchi he
 The Prime Minister Agricultural Irrigation Scheme, if the farmer gets water, has the power to produce gold from the soil and so to provide water to the farmer last time i told the Red Fort, we have completed 21 of those schemes and the rest 50 plans will be completed in the coming time
 or total 99 yojanaon kaa maine sankalp liya he
 We will complete the water supply to the farmer's farm by completing those 99 big plans before 2019
 or kisaan ko beej se bazaar tak, jab tak ham vyastha nahin dete hai, hamaare kisaan ke bhagya ko ham nahin badal sakate hai
 And therefore it needs infrastructure, it needs supply-chain
 har saal lakhon-karodon rupayon kii hamaari sabji, hamaare fal, hamaari fasal barbaad ho jaati he or isliye usko badalane ke liye ek to Foreign Direct Investment ko badhaava diya taaki food processing ke andar duniya hamaare saath jude
 Promoted to create infrastructure and Government of India has implemented 'pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojana'
 jiske kaaran un vyavasthaaon kaa nirmaan kiya jayega jo beej se bazaar tak kisaan ko hand-holding karenge, vyavasthaaen viksit karenge or hamaare karodon kisaanon kii jindagi main ek nayaa badlaav laane main ham safal honge
 Due to Demand and Technology, the nature of job is also changing in our country
 rojgaar se judi yojanaon main, training ke tareeke main 21veen sadi kii aavashyaktaaon ke anusaar, maanav sansaadhan ke vikaas ke liye bharat sarkaar ne anek nai yojanaayen haath main lee hai
 a huge campaign has been launched to ensure that the youth get money from banks without guarantee
 hamaara noujvaan apane pairon par khadaa ho, wo rojgaar paane vaala rahe, rojgaar dene vaala bane, or pichley teen saal main dekha he ki ‘pradhanmantri mudra yojana’ ke kaaran karodon noujvaan apane pairon par khadey hue hai
 Not only this, a young man is also employing one or two to three more people
 shiksha ke kshetra main World Class Universities banane ke liye hamane bandhanon se mukti dene kaa ek bada ahm kadam uthaaya he
 20 Universities have been called upon to decide their fate, Government will not come anywhere
 upar se sarkaar 1000 karod rupee tak kii madad karne ke liye bhi taiyaar he
 Has given a call, i am sure the educational institutions of my country will definitely come forward and make it successful
 pichley teen varsh main 6 IIT, 7 nae IIM, 8 nae IIIT, iskaa nirmaan kiya he or shiksha ko naukari ke avasaron ke saath jodne kaa bhi is ko kaam hamane kiya he
 My mothers, sisters, today, in large quantities, women in the family also go for employment
 or isliye raatri ko bhi unako rojgaar kaa avasar mili, factoriyon main kaam karne kaa avasar mili, isliye Labour Laws main parivartan karne kaa bahut bada ahm kadam uthaaya he
 Our mothers and sisters are also an important unit of the family
 hamaara bhavishya nirmaan karne ke liye hamaari maataaon, bahanon kaa yogadan bahut bada hota he, or isliye Maternity Leave jo 12 saptaah kii thi, wo 26 saptaah, usamen aay chaalu rahegi, is prakaar se dene kaa kaam kiya he
 With regard to the work of empowerment of our women today, in particular, i would like to congratulate the sisters who have been forced to live a very difficult life due to triple talaq
 koi aashray nahin bachaa he, or aisi peedit, teen-talaak se peedit bahanon ne puure desh main ek andolan khadaa kiya he
 The intellectual class of the country was shaken, the media of the country also helped them, an atmosphere was created against triple talaq in the whole country
 is andolan ko chalaane vaali un meri bahanon ko, jo teen-talaak ke khilaaf ladai lard rahi hai, main hriday se unka abhindann karata hum or mujhe vishwaas he, ki maataaon-bahanon ko adhikaar dilaane main, unki is ladaai main hindustan unki puri madad karegaa
 Hindustan will help and it will be successful in this important step of Women Empowerment; i am sure of this
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyo, kabhi-kabhi aasthaa ke naam par dhairya ke abhaav main kuch log aisi chijen kar baithte hai, jo samaaj ke taane-bane ko bikher detii hai
 The country operates with peace, goodwill and unity
 jatvaad kaa jehar, sampradayawad kaa jehar, desh kaa kabhi bhala nahin kar saktaa he
 This is Gandhi's land, Buddha's land, take everyone along and walk; It is part of the culture and tradition of this country
 hamen isko safalataa se aage badhanaa he, or isliye aasthaa ke naam par hinsa ko bal nahin diya ja saktaa he
 If something happens to the patient in the hospital, the hospital is burnt; Accidentally, carts should be burnt; Move, government property be burned; Whose is this for Azad Hindustan? We have assets of 1
25 billion countrymen
 ye saanskrithik viraasat kiski he? ye ham sava sau karod deshavaasiyon kii saanskrithik viraasat he
 Whose faith is this? We are the faith of 125 crore countrymen; And so the path of violence in the name of faith can never go on in this country, this country can never accept
 or isliye main deshavaasiyon se aagrah karuunga, us samay ‘bharat chodo’ kaa naaraa tha, aaj naaraa he ‘bharat jodo’
 We have to take person-to-person, take people-to-people, we have to take every section of the society together, and we have to take the country forward by taking the same
 samrudh bharat banane ke liye hamaari majboot arthvyavastha chahie
 We need balanced development, next generation infrastructure, then we can see the India of our dreams in front of our eyes
 bhaaiyo-bahanon, anginat nirnay hamane teen saal main liye
 Some things have been noted and some things may not have come into notice
 lekin ek baat mahatvapurn he
 When you make such a big change, the stops come, the speed stops
 lekin is sarkaar kii kaaryastylee dekhie, agar train bhi kisi railway stesan ke paas se guzarati he, jab trek badalati he to 60 se chalane vaali speed ko usko 30 kii speed main laana padataa he
 The speed of the train decreases by changing the track
 ham puure desh ko ek nae trek par le jane kaa prayaas kar rahe hai, lekin hamane uski speed kam nahin hone di he, hamane uski gati ko barkaraar rakhaa he
 Whether we bring GST, any law, any new system, we have succeeded in doing that and we will do it in future
 hamane infrastructure par bal diya he
 Unprecedented expenses are being given on infrastructure
 railway stesan kaa aadhunikeekaran ho, chote shahar main, chaahe airport bananaa ho, chaahe water-way kii vyavastha kerani ho, chaahe roadways kii vyavastha kerani ho, chaahe gas grid banani ho, chaahe pani kii grid karaani ho, chaahe optical fibre network karnaa ho, har prakaar ke aadhunik infrastructure par ham purna bal de rahe hai
 My dear countrymen, our eastern India is the most energetic field to advance India in the 21st century
 itnaa potential he, samarthyavan maanav sansaadhan he, apaar prakritik sampada he, parishram ke dhani hai, sankalp karke jindagi badalane kaa samarthy rakhte hai
 Our entire focus is on eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Bengal, Assam, North East, Odisha, these are our powerful states, where natural wealth is abundant, we are trying to take the country to a new height by taking it forward
 bhaaiyo-bahanon, bhrashtachar mukt bharat ek bada ahm kaam he, usko ham bal dene kaa prayaas kar rahe he
 After the formation of the government, the first task was to create SIT
 aaj teen saal ke baad main deshavaasiyon ko bataanaa chahta hum, garv se bataanaa chahta hum ki teen saal ke bheetar-bheetar, kareeb-kareeb sava lakh karod rupye se bhi zyada kalaadhan ko hamane khoj diya he, usko pakadaa he or usko suurender karne ke liye majaboor kiya he
 After that we decided to demonetise
 notebandi ke dwaara hamane anek mahatvapurn safaltaaen praapt kii hai
 The black money that was hidden had to come into the mainstream
 aapane dekha hoga ki ham kabhi 07 din-10 din-15 din badhaate jate the, kabhi petrol pump par, kabhi dawaai kii dukaan par, kabhi railway stesan par puraane note lene kaa silsilaa jari rakhte the, kyonki hamaara prayaas tha ki ek baar jo bhi dhan aae wo bainkon main formal economy kaa hissaa ban jaae or us kaam ko hamane safaltaapurvak paar kiya he
 And the reason for this is that the research that has been done now, is about three lakh crore rupees
 
 
 ye sarkaar ne research nahin kii he, baahar ke expert ne kii he
 Three lakh crore rupees after demonetisation, the additional, which never came back in the banking system, has come

 This year, see the result, 56 lakh new taxpayers filing income tax returns from 01 April to 05 August
 pichley saal usee avadhi main ye sankhya sirf 22 lakh thi
 More than double! These reasons are the result of our fight against black money
 18 lakh se zyada aise logon ko pahchaan liya gaya he, jinaki aay unke hisaab kitaab se kuch zyada he, beshumaar zyada he or isaliye is antar kaa unako jawaab dena pad rahaa he
 Out of this, four and a half lakh people have now come to the field, accepting their mistake and trying to get in the way
 ek lakh log aise saamne aae hai, jinhone kabhi jindagi main Income Tax kaa naam bhi nahin suna tha, na Income Tax kabhi diya tha, na kabhi unhone us par sochaa tha, lekin aaj unako wo karnaa pad rahaa he
 Brothers and sisters, if two or four companies are shut down in our country, then there are discussions on them round the clock
 arthniti khatm ho gai


 ye ho gaya, na jane kya kya hota he! aapako jaanakar ke hairaani hogi, kaale dhan ke kaarobaari, Shell companiyaan chalaate the or notebandi ke baad jab data-mining kiya gaya
 Then three lakh such companies have been found, which are just and shell companies only

 Three lakhs, one can imagine

 If you put an LED bulb, then a thousand rupees two thousand five thousand rupees of the year are going to save you

 Together we will create an India where there will be no compromise on corruption and nepotism
 ham sab milakar ke ek aisa bharat banaaenge, jo svachh hoga, swasth hoga or swaraj ke sapane ko puraa karegaa
 And therefore my dear countrymen, we will all try to work together in this race of development
 aaj aazaadee ke 70 saal ke baad, aazaadee ke 75 saal kii pratiksha ke bich paanch saal ke mahatvapurn kaarykaal main ek ‘divya-bhavy bharat’ ke sapane ko lekar ke ham sabhi deshvasi chalem, isi ek bhav ke saath main phir ek baar aazaadee ke diwaanon ko pranaam karata hum

 saabhaar: PIB And that's why i am happy that due to the efforts of our security forces, a large number of young people have surrendered in the area of left-wing Extremism and tried to get into the mainstream
 seemaa kii raksha ke liye hamaare jawan tainaat hai
 i am happy that today the Government of India is launching a website which is the winner of Gallantry Award, the people who will make our country proud, along with their complete information, a portal based on the recipients of a Gallantry Award will also be started today
 It has been so that the new generation of the country can get a lot of information about these brave sacrifices of ours
 Technology kii madad se, desh main eemaandaaree ko bal dene kaa ham logon kaa bharpoor prayaas he
 Our fight against black money will continue
 bhrashtchaar ke khilaaf hamaari ladaai jari rahegi
 And we have gradually made many unsuccessful efforts towards bringing transparency, connecting the AADHAR system by interveneing technology and many people in the world discuss and study this model of India
 sarkaar main bhi kharidi karne main ab chota-sa vyakti bhi hajaaron kilometre dur baitha gaanv kaa vyakti bhi sarkaar ko apana maal supply kar saktaa he, apane product supply kar saktaa he
 He does not need an elder, he does not need a middleman
 GEM naam kaa ek portal banaaya he, GEM uske dwaara government procure kar rahi he
 It has been successful in bringing a lot of transparency
 bhaiyon-bahanon, sarkari kii yojanaon main raftaar badi he
 When the government is delayed in some work, it is not just the project delay
 wo sirf dhan ke kharchen se judaa hua vishay nahin hota he
 When any work gets stuck, stops, then my poor families suffer the most
 mere bhaiyo-bahanon ko hota he
 We can reach Mangalyaan within nine months
 yah hamaara samarthy he
 Mangalyaan can be reached from here within nine months
 lekin maine ek baar sarkaar ke kaam kaa lekha-jokha har maheene letaa rahata hum
 Once such a thing came to my attention, a 42-year-old project, a 70-72 km project, stuck on the rail for 42 years, was hanging
 bhaiyon-bahanon nau maheene main mangalayan pahunchane kaa samarthy rakhane vaala meraa desh 42 saal tak 70-72 kilometre ek rail kii patari na bicha sake, tab garib ke man main sawaal uthta he ki mere desh kaa kya hoga? or aisi chizon par hamane dhyaan diya he
 To change these things, we have tried to bring changes in them by adding all these things, be it the subject of new technology, geo-technology, space-technology
 aapane dekha hoga ek samay tha jab uria ke liye rajya or centre main tanaav chalata tha
 For kerosene, the state and center were tense
 ek aisa maahaul tha, jaise centre bada bhai, rajya chota bhai he
 The direction we worked from day one, because i have been the Chief Minister for a long time, so i know how important states are in the development of the country
 mukhyamantriyon kaa kitna mahatv he, rajyon kii sarkaron kaa kitna mahatv he, isko main bhalee-bhaanti samajhataa hum or isliye Co-operative Federalism or ab Competitive Co-operative Federalism us par hamane bal diya he or aapane dekha hoga ki aaj mil karke saare nirnay, ham mil karke kar rahe hai
 You will remember that from the ramparts of this Red Fort, once the Prime Minister discussed the plight of the power companies of the states of the country
 laal kile par se chintaa vyakt kerani padi thi
 Today, by taking the states together with the 'uday Yojana', by giving strength to the states, these problems were there in the business of the power factories, working together to solve it, this is a great proof of Federalism
 GST ke saath-saath chaahe Smart City ke nirmaan kii baat ho, chaahe swatchta kaa abhiyaan ho, chaahe toilet kii charchaa ho, Ease of doing Business kii baat ho, yah saare vishay aise hai ki hamaare desh ke sabhi rajya kandhe se kandhaa mila karke aaj bharat ke saath bharat kii sarkaar, kandhe se kandhaa mila karke rajya ke saath chalane main bahut safal ho rahi he
 My dear countrymen 'new India' is our greatest strength, democracy
 lekin ham jaanate hai ki hamane loktantr ko mat-patr tak simit kar diya he
 Democracy cannot be limited to ballot papers
 or isliye ham ‘new India’ main us loktantr par bal dena chaahate hai jisamen tantra se lok nahin, lekin logon se tantra chale, aisa loktantr ‘new India’ kii pahchaan bane, us disha main ham janaa chaahate hai
 Lokmanya Tilak ji had said, 'swarajya is my birth right'
 aaazaad bharat me ham sabakaa mantra hona chahie, ‘surajya meraa janmasiddh adhikaar he’
 'state' should be the responsibility of all of us
 naagarik ko apni jimmedaariyaan nibhaani chahie, sarkaron ne apni jimmedaariyaan nibhaani chahie
 When we have to walk from 'swarajya to Surajya', the countrymen do not stay back
 jab maine gas sabsidi chhodane ke liye kaha, desh aage aayaa
 Speaking of cleanliness, even today, in every corner of India, some one is carrying forward the cleanliness drive
 jab notebandi kii baat ai, duniya ko aashcharya hua tha, yahaan tak log kah rahe the, ab modi gaya
 But the patience of the 125 crore countrymen who showed in demonetisation, the faith that they told and the result of that, today we are succeeding in taking steps against corruption
 hamaare desh ke liye is nai lokbhagidaari kii parampara
 
 
 It is our effort to advance the country by public participation
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, laal bahadur shastri ne jai jawan jai kisaan kaa mantra diya tha
 The farmer of our country has never looked back, our farmer is giving record crop production today
 prakritik aapadaaon ke bich main nai–nai siddhiyaan wo hasil kar rahaa he
 There has been a record production of pulses and my dear brothers and sisters, my farmer brothers and sisters, there has never been a tradition of buying pulses in government in India and once in a while, according to thousands of tons It used to be, this time when the farmers of my country produced pulses and served nutritious food to the poor, the government increased this work by doing the historic work of buying 16 lakh tons of pulses Have received
 pradhanmantri fasal beemaa yojana, ek suraksha kavach mere kisaan bhaiyon ko mila he
 Three years ago, only 1
25 crore farmers used to take advantage of this Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, which was earlier known by another name
 aaj pradhanmantri fasal beemaa yojana main itane kam samay main kai naye kisaan iske saath jud gaye hai or kareeb-kareeb ye sankhya aage chalakar ke paune chah karod par pahunchi he
 The Prime Minister Agricultural Irrigation Scheme, if the farmer gets water, has the power to produce gold from the soil and so to provide water to the farmer last time i told the Red Fort, we have completed 21 of those schemes and the rest 50 plans will be completed in the coming time
 or total 99 yojanaon kaa maine sankalp liya he
 We will complete the water supply to the farmer's farm by completing those 99 big plans before 2019
 or kisaan ko beej se bazaar tak, jab tak ham vyastha nahin dete hai, hamaare kisaan ke bhagya ko ham nahin badal sakate hai
 And therefore it needs infrastructure, it needs supply-chain
 har saal lakhon-karodon rupayon kii hamaari sabji, hamaare fal, hamaari fasal barbaad ho jaati he or isliye usko badalane ke liye ek to Foreign Direct Investment ko badhaava diya taaki food processing ke andar duniya hamaare saath jude
 Promoted to create infrastructure and Government of India has implemented 'pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojana'
 jiske kaaran un vyavasthaaon kaa nirmaan kiya jayega jo beej se bazaar tak kisaan ko hand-holding karenge, vyavasthaaen viksit karenge or hamaare karodon kisaanon kii jindagi main ek nayaa badlaav laane main ham safal honge
 Due to Demand and Technology, the nature of job is also changing in our country
 rojgaar se judi yojanaon main, training ke tareeke main 21veen sadi kii aavashyaktaaon ke anusaar, maanav sansaadhan ke vikaas ke liye bharat sarkaar ne anek nai yojanaayen haath main lee hai
 a huge campaign has been launched to ensure that the youth get money from banks without guarantee
 hamaara noujvaan apane pairon par khadaa ho, wo rojgaar paane vaala rahe, rojgaar dene vaala bane, or pichley teen saal main dekha he ki ‘pradhanmantri mudra yojana’ ke kaaran karodon noujvaan apane pairon par khadey hue hai
 Not only this, a young man is also employing one or two to three more people
 shiksha ke kshetra main World Class Universities banane ke liye hamane bandhanon se mukti dene kaa ek bada ahm kadam uthaaya he
 20 Universities have been called upon to decide their fate, Government will not come anywhere
 upar se sarkaar 1000 karod rupee tak kii madad karne ke liye bhi taiyaar he
 Has given a call, i am sure the educational institutions of my country will definitely come forward and make it successful
 pichley teen varsh main 6 IIT, 7 nae IIM, 8 nae IIIT, iskaa nirmaan kiya he or shiksha ko naukari ke avasaron ke saath jodne kaa bhi is ko kaam hamane kiya he
 My mothers, sisters, today, in large quantities, women in the family also go for employment
 or isliye raatri ko bhi unako rojgaar kaa avasar mili, factoriyon main kaam karne kaa avasar mili, isliye Labour Laws main parivartan karne kaa bahut bada ahm kadam uthaaya he
 Our mothers and sisters are also an important unit of the family
 hamaara bhavishya nirmaan karne ke liye hamaari maataaon, bahanon kaa yogadan bahut bada hota he, or isliye Maternity Leave jo 12 saptaah kii thi, wo 26 saptaah, usamen aay chaalu rahegi, is prakaar se dene kaa kaam kiya he
 With regard to the work of empowerment of our women today, in particular, i would like to congratulate the sisters who have been forced to live a very difficult life due to triple talaq
 koi aashray nahin bachaa he, or aisi peedit, teen-talaak se peedit bahanon ne puure desh main ek andolan khadaa kiya he
 The intellectual class of the country was shaken, the media of the country also helped them, an atmosphere was created against triple talaq in the whole country
 is andolan ko chalaane vaali un meri bahanon ko, jo teen-talaak ke khilaaf ladai lard rahi hai, main hriday se unka abhindann karata hum or mujhe vishwaas he, ki maataaon-bahanon ko adhikaar dilaane main, unki is ladaai main hindustan unki puri madad karegaa
 Hindustan will help and it will be successful in this important step of Women Empowerment; i am sure of this
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyo, kabhi-kabhi aasthaa ke naam par dhairya ke abhaav main kuch log aisi chijen kar baithte hai, jo samaaj ke taane-bane ko bikher detii hai
 The country operates with peace, goodwill and unity
 jatvaad kaa jehar, sampradayawad kaa jehar, desh kaa kabhi bhala nahin kar saktaa he
 This is Gandhi's land, Buddha's land, take everyone along and walk; It is part of the culture and tradition of this country
 hamen isko safalataa se aage badhanaa he, or isliye aasthaa ke naam par hinsa ko bal nahin diya ja saktaa he
 If something happens to the patient in the hospital, the hospital is burnt; Accidentally, carts should be burnt; Move, government property be burned; Whose is this for Azad Hindustan? We have assets of 1
25 billion countrymen
 ye saanskrithik viraasat kiski he? ye ham sava sau karod deshavaasiyon kii saanskrithik viraasat he
 Whose faith is this? We are the faith of 125 crore countrymen; And so the path of violence in the name of faith can never go on in this country, this country can never accept
 or isliye main deshavaasiyon se aagrah karuunga, us samay ‘bharat chodo’ kaa naaraa tha, aaj naaraa he ‘bharat jodo’
 We have to take person-to-person, take people-to-people, we have to take every section of the society together, and we have to take the country forward by taking the same
 samrudh bharat banane ke liye hamaari majboot arthvyavastha chahie
 We need balanced development, next generation infrastructure, then we can see the India of our dreams in front of our eyes
 bhaaiyo-bahanon, anginat nirnay hamane teen saal main liye
 Some things have been noted and some things may not have come into notice
 lekin ek baat mahatvapurn he
 When you make such a big change, the stops come, the speed stops
 lekin is sarkaar kii kaaryastylee dekhie, agar train bhi kisi railway stesan ke paas se guzarati he, jab trek badalati he to 60 se chalane vaali speed ko usko 30 kii speed main laana padataa he
 The speed of the train decreases by changing the track
 ham puure desh ko ek nae trek par le jane kaa prayaas kar rahe hai, lekin hamane uski speed kam nahin hone di he, hamane uski gati ko barkaraar rakhaa he
 Whether we bring GST, any law, any new system, we have succeeded in doing that and we will do it in future
 hamane infrastructure par bal diya he
 Unprecedented expenses are being given on infrastructure
 railway stesan kaa aadhunikeekaran ho, chote shahar main, chaahe airport bananaa ho, chaahe water-way kii vyavastha kerani ho, chaahe roadways kii vyavastha kerani ho, chaahe gas grid banani ho, chaahe pani kii grid karaani ho, chaahe optical fibre network karnaa ho, har prakaar ke aadhunik infrastructure par ham purna bal de rahe hai
 My dear countrymen, our eastern India is the most energetic field to advance India in the 21st century
 itnaa potential he, samarthyavan maanav sansaadhan he, apaar prakritik sampada he, parishram ke dhani hai, sankalp karke jindagi badalane kaa samarthy rakhte hai
 Our entire focus is on eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Bengal, Assam, North East, Odisha, these are our powerful states, where natural wealth is abundant, we are trying to take the country to a new height by taking it forward
 bhaaiyo-bahanon, bhrashtachar mukt bharat ek bada ahm kaam he, usko ham bal dene kaa prayaas kar rahe he
 After the formation of the government, the first task was to create SIT
 aaj teen saal ke baad main deshavaasiyon ko bataanaa chahta hum, garv se bataanaa chahta hum ki teen saal ke bheetar-bheetar, kareeb-kareeb sava lakh karod rupye se bhi zyada kalaadhan ko hamane khoj diya he, usko pakadaa he or usko suurender karne ke liye majaboor kiya he
 After that we decided to demonetise
 notebandi ke dwaara hamane anek mahatvapurn safaltaaen praapt kii hai
 The black money that was hidden had to come into the mainstream
 aapane dekha hoga ki ham kabhi 07 din-10 din-15 din badhaate jate the, kabhi petrol pump par, kabhi dawaai kii dukaan par, kabhi railway stesan par puraane note lene kaa silsilaa jari rakhte the, kyonki hamaara prayaas tha ki ek baar jo bhi dhan aae wo bainkon main formal economy kaa hissaa ban jaae or us kaam ko hamane safaltaapurvak paar kiya he
 And the reason for this is that the research that has been done now, is about three lakh crore rupees
 
 
 ye sarkaar ne research nahin kii he, baahar ke expert ne kii he
 Three lakh crore rupees after demonetisation, the additional, which never came back in the banking system, has come
 bainkon main jamaa kii gai raashi main paune do lakh karod se adhik raashi shaq ke ghere main he
 At least two lakh crore rupees of black money has had to reach the banks and now they are forced to give their answers with the system
 nae kaledhan par bhi bahut badi rukaawat aa gai he
 This year, see the result, 56 lakh new taxpayers filing income tax returns from 01 April to 05 August
 pichley saal usee avadhi main ye sankhya sirf 22 lakh thi
 More than double! These reasons are the result of our fight against black money
 18 lakh se zyada aise logon ko pahchaan liya gaya he, jinaki aay unke hisaab kitaab se kuch zyada he, beshumaar zyada he or isaliye is antar kaa unako jawaab dena pad rahaa he
 Out of this, four and a half lakh people have now come to the field, accepting their mistake and trying to get in the way
 ek lakh log aise saamne aae hai, jinhone kabhi jindagi main Income Tax kaa naam bhi nahin suna tha, na Income Tax kabhi diya tha, na kabhi unhone us par sochaa tha, lekin aaj unako wo karnaa pad rahaa he
 Brothers and sisters, if two or four companies are shut down in our country, then there are discussions on them round the clock
 arthniti khatm ho gai


 ye ho gaya, na jane kya kya hota he! aapako jaanakar ke hairaani hogi, kaale dhan ke kaarobaari, Shell companiyaan chalaate the or notebandi ke baad jab data-mining kiya gaya
 Then three lakh such companies have been found, which are just and shell companies only
 hawala kaa kaarobaar karti hai
 Three lakhs, one can imagine
 or usamen se paune do lakh kaa registration hamanen Cancel kar diya he
 If five companies are closed, then there is a storm in India
 paune do lakh companiyon ko taale laga diye
 Those who looted the goods of the country will have to answer, we did this by doing this
 aapako hairaani hogi! kuch to shell companiyaan aisi hai, jo ek hi Address par chaar sau chaar sau companiyaan chal rahi thim, bhaaiyon bahanon
 Four hundred and four hundred companies were operating
 koi dekhne vaala nahin tha, koi poochne vaala nahin tha
 All the collusion was going on
 or isaliye mere bhaaiyon bahanon, maine bhrashtachar kaale dhan ke khilaaf ek bahut badi ladaai chhedi he
 For the betterment of the country, for the welfare of the poor of the country, for the future of the youth of the country
 bhaaiyon bahanon, ek ke baad ek kadam or mujhe vishwaas he GST ke baad usamen or badhotaree hone vaali he
 And Transparency is forthcoming
 akele Transportation hamaara trek vaala ek sthaan se duusare sthaan par jaataa tha
 After this GST, thirty percent of his time is saved
 check-post khatm hone ke kaaran hajaaron karod rupayon kii to bachat hui he
 The biggest savings have been time
 ek prakaar se uski tees pratishat Efficiency bad rahi he
 You can imagine what it means to increase thirty percent efficiency in the transport world of India
 ek GST ke kaaran itnaa bada parivartan aayaa he
 My dear countrymen, today money has come to banks due to demonetisation

 The 'BHIM-AADHAR App' is a wonder within the world for Digital Transaction
 rupay Card 
 
 
 In India, rupay Card is worth crores
 or agar wo operational ho jayega, wo agar garibon ke jeb main he, to duniya kaa, ye sabase bada ho jayega
 And that's why my dear countrymen, i request you to move ahead by taking a pledge for 'new India', and do it in time
 hamaare yahaan shastron main kaha gaya haih aniyat kaal:, aniyat kaalah prabhutayo viplavante, prabhutayo viplavante
 If a task is not completed at the right time, then the desired result is never achieved
 or isaliye ‘team India’ ke liye, sava sau karod deshavaasiyon kii team India ke liye, aaj hamen sankalp lenaa hoga 2022 tak ‘new India’ banane kaa or ye kaam ham khud karenge, koi karegaa aisa nahin, ham khud karenge
 Will do for the country, will do better than before, will do more than before, will do it with dedication, in 2022 to see 'grand-divine' Hindustan
 or isaliye ham sab milakar ke ek aisa bharat banaaenge jahaan garib ke paas pakkaa ghar ho, bijli ho, pani ho
 Together we will create an India where the farmer of the country will sleep peacefully
 aaj wo jitna kama rahaa he, usase 2022 tak doguna kamayega
 Together we will create an India where youth and women will have ample opportunities to fulfill their dreams
 ham sab milakar ke ek aisa bharat banaaenge, jo aatankwaad sampradayawad or jatvaad se mukt hoga
 Together we will create an India where there will be no compromise on corruption and nepotism
 ham sab milakar ke ek aisa bharat banaaenge, jo svachh hoga, swasth hoga or swaraj ke sapane ko puraa karegaa
 And therefore my dear countrymen, we will all try to work together in this race of development
 aaj aazaadee ke 70 saal ke baad, aazaadee ke 75 saal kii pratiksha ke bich paanch saal ke mahatvapurn kaarykaal main ek ‘divya-bhavy bharat’ ke sapane ko lekar ke ham sabhi deshvasi chalem, isi ek bhav ke saath main phir ek baar aazaadee ke diwaanon ko pranaam karata hum
 i salute the new faith, new zeal of 1
25 billion countrymen
 or nae sankalp ke saath aage chalane ke liye ‘team India’ ko aahvaan karata hum
 With this feeling, my heartiest greetings to all of you
 bharat mata kii jai, vande maataram jai hind

 saabhaar: PIB Our soldiers are deployed to protect the border
 mujhe khushi he ki aaj bharat sarkaar ek aisi website launch kar rahi he, jo Gallantry Award vijeta he, hamaare desh ko gaurav dilaane vaale log hai, unki puri jaankariyon ke saath aaj ek Gallantry Award praapt karne waalon par aadhaarit ek Portal bhi prarambh kiya ja rahaa he, jisase desh kii nai peedi ko hamaare in vir balidaniyon ke bare main bahut sari jaankariyaan praapt ho sakati hai
 With the help of technology, we have made every effort to strengthen honesty in the country
 kaledhan ke khilaaf hamaari ladaai jari rahegi
 Our fight against corruption will continue
 or hamane dhire-dhire Technology ko intervene karte hue AADHAR kii vyavastha ko jodate hue, transparency laane kii disha main anek vidd-safal prayaas kiye hai or duniya ke anek log bharat ke is model kii charchaa bhi karte hai or uskaa adhyayan bhi karte hai
 Now, even a small person sitting in the government, thousands of kilometers away, can also supply his goods and supply his products to the government
 usko bade kii jarurat nahin he, bichauliye kii jarurat nahin he
 a portal named GEM has been created, GEM is doing government procurement by him
 bahut sari maatra main transparency laane main safalataa mili he
 Ladies & Gentlemen, the speed of government schemes has increased
 jab sarkaar, kisi kaam main vilamb ho jaataa he, to sirf wo project vilamb nahin hota
 It is not just a matter related to the expenditure of money
 jab koi bhi kaam atak jaataa he, ruuk jaataa he to sabase zyada nuksaan mere garib pariwaron ko hota he
 My brothers and sisters
 ham nau maheene ke bheetar-bheetar mangalayan pahunch sakate hai
 This is our strength
 nau maheene ke bheetar-bheetar yahaan se mangalayan pahunch sakate hai
 But once every month i keep an account of the work of the government
 ek baar aisi baat mere dhyaan main ai, 42 saal purana ek project, 70-72 kilometre kaa project, rail kaa 42 saal se atka padaa, lataka padaa tha
 Brothers and sisters, my country, which has the ability to reach Mangalyaan in nine months, cannot lay a rail track for 70-72 kilometers for 42 years, then the question arises in the mind of the poor that what will happen to my country? And we have focused on such things
 in chizon main badlaav laane ke liye hamane nai-nai technology geo-technology kaa vishay ho, space-technology kaa vishay ho in sari chizon ko jod karke hamane usamen parivartan laane kaa prayaas kiya he
 You must have seen a time when there was tension in the state and center for urea
 kerosene ke liye rajya or centre ke liye tanaav chalata tha
 There was an atmosphere like the center is the elder brother, the state is the younger brother
 hamane pehle din se jis disha main kaam kiya, kyonki lambe arase se mukhyamantri rahaa hum, isliye mujhe pataa he ki desh ke vikaas main rajyon kii kitni ahmiyat he
 i understand the importance of the Chief Ministers, how important the Governments of the States are, and therefore Co-operative Federalism and now Competitive Co-operative Federalism we have emphasized that and you must have seen that today all the decisions together , We are doing it together
 aapako yaad hoga isi lalakile kii pracheer se ek baar desh ke rajyo kii bijli companiyon kii durdasha kii charchaa ek pradhanmantri ne kii thi
 Had to worry about the Red Fort
 aaj hamane rajyon ko saath le kar ke ‘udai yojana’ ke dwaara rajyon ko takat de karke us bijli ke kaarkaanon ke kaarobaar main yah samasyaayein thi, uskaa samaadhaan kaa kaam mil karke kiya, yah Federalism kaa ek bahut bada saboot he
 Along with the GST, whether it is about the construction of Smart City, whether it is a campaign for cleanliness, whether it is a discussion of toilet, ease of doing business, all these subjects are such that all the states of our country join shoulder to shoulder
 Today, the Government of India is being very successful in running shoulder to shoulder with the state
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyon ‘new India’ hamaari sabase badi takat he, loktantr he
 But we know that we have limited democracy to the ballot paper
 loktantr mat-patr tak simit nahin ho saktaa
 And that is why we want to emphasize on democracy in 'new India' in which the system is not public, but the people should have the system, so that democracy should become the identity of 'new India', we want to go in that direction
 lokmaanya tilak ji ne kaha tha, ‘swarajya meraa janmasiddh adhikaar he’
 The mantra of all of us in independent India should be, 'state is my rightful birth'
 ‘surajya’ ham sabakaa daayitv hona chahie
 Citizens should carry out their responsibilities, governments should fulfill their responsibilities
 ‘swarajya se surajya’ kii ore jab chalanaa he, to deshvasi peeche nahin rahete
 When i asked to give up the gas subsidy, the country came forward
 swatchta kii baat kahi, aaj bhi hindustan ke har kone main koi na koi swatchta ke abhiyaan ko aage badha rahaa he
 When it came to demonetisation, the world was surprised, even people were saying, now Modi has gone
 lekin notebandi main sava sau karod deshavaasiyon ne jis dhairya ko dikhaaya, jis vishwaas ko bataaya or usee kaa parinaam he ki aaj bhrashtachar ke khilaaf nakel lagane main ham ek ke baad kadam uthaane main safal ho rahe hai
 This new tradition of public participation for our country
 
 
 janabhagidaari se hi desh ko aage badhaane main hamaara prayaas he
 My dear countrymen, Lal Bahadur Shastri gave the mantra of Jai Jawan Jai Kisan
 hamaare desh ke kisaan ne peeche mud ke kabhi dekha nahin, record fasal utpaadan aaj hamaara kisaan karke de rahaa he
 In the midst of natural disasters, he is getting new achievements
 daal kaa record utpaadan hua he or mere pyaare bhaiyo bahanon, mere kisaan bhaiyo bahanon, hindustan main kabhi bhi sarkaar main daal kharidne kii parampara hi nahin rahi he or kabhi ek-aadh baar kiya ho to hajaaron main hi hajaaron ton ke hisaab ke hisaab se hota tha, is baar jab mere desh ke kisaanon ne daal utpaadan karke garib ko paushtik aahaar dene kaa kaam kiya, to 16 lakh ton daal, sarkaar ne kharidne kaa aitihaasik kaam karke is kaam ko badhaava diya
 Prime Minister Crop Insurance Scheme, a security shield has been provided to my farmer brothers
 teen saal pehle sirf sava teen karod kisaan is pradhanmantri fasal beemaa yojana, jo pehle duusare naam se chalati thi uskaa laabh lete the
 Today, in such a short time under the Prime Minister Crop Insurance Scheme, many new farmers have joined with it and almost these numbers have reached a further six crores
 pradhanmantri krishi sinchai yojana, kisaan ko agar pani mili to mitti main se sona paidaa karne kii takat rakhata he or isliye kisaan ko pani pahunchane ke liye maine pichhali baar lalakile se kaha tha, un yojaanaaon main se 21 yojana ham purna kar chuke hai or baaki 50 yojanaayen aane vaale kuch samay main purna ho jaaengi
 And i have resolved a total of 99 schemes
 2019 ke pehle un 99 badi-bady yojanaayen ko paripurna karke, kisaan ke khet tak pani pahunchane kaa kaam ham purna kar denge
 And we cannot change the fate of our farmer till we provide for the farmer from seed to market
 or isliye uske liye infrastructure chahie, uske liye supply-chain chahie
 Every year our vegetables, our fruits, our crops worth millions and billions are wasted and so to change that, one has encouraged Foreign Direct Investment so that the world can join us in food processing
 Infrastructure banane ke liye badhaava diya or bharat sarkaar ne ‘pradhanmantri kisaan sampada yojana’ lagu kii he
 Due to which arrangements will be made that will hand-hold the farmer from seed to market, develop systems and we will be successful in bringing a new change in the lives of our crores of farmers
 Demand or Technology ke kaaran, hamaare desh main nature of job main bhi bahut bada badlaav aa rahaa he
 In employment related schemes, according to the requirements of 21st century in the way of training, the Government of India has taken up many new schemes for the development of human resources
 naujavaanon ko bina guarantee bainkon se paisa mili iske liye bahut bada abhiyaan chalaaya he
 Our youth should stand on their feet, they should get employment, become employable, and in the last three years we have seen that due to 'pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana', crores of youth have stood on their feet
 itnaa hi nahin, ek noujvaan ek yaa do teen or logon ko bhi rojgaar de rahaa he
 To create World Class Universities in the field of education, we have taken a major step to break free from bondage
 20 uniwarsitiyon kaa aahvaan kiya he ki aap apane bhagya kaa faisla kiijie, sarkaar kahin bich main nahin aegi
 From above the government is also ready to help up to 1000 crores rupees
 aahvaan kiya he, mujhe vishwaas he mere desh kii shiksha sansthaaon main jarur aage aaenge, isko safal karenge
 In the last three years, 6 iits, 7 new iims, 8 new iiits have been built, and we have also done this work to link education with job opportunities
 meri maatayen, bahanen aaj bahut badi maatra main, parivaar main mahilaayein bhi rojgaar ke liye jaati hai
 And so at night, they get employment opportunities, work in factories, so have taken a very important step to change Labor Laws
 hamaari maatayen, bahanen parivaar kii bhi ek ahm ikai hai
 The contribution of our mothers and sisters is huge to build our future, and so Maternity Leave, which was 12 weeks, will continue to have income in 26 weeks, thus giving has worked
 main aaj hamaari mahilaon ke shashaktikaran ke kaam ke sambandh main, main khaas karke, main un bahanon kaa abhinandan karnaa chahta hum jo teen talaak ke kaaran bahut hi durdavy jindagi jeene ke liye majaboor hui hai
 There is no shelter left, and such afflicted, triple-divorced sisters have started a movement across the country
 desh ke buddhijivi varg ko hilaa diya, desh ke media ne bhi unki madad kii, puure desh main teen-talaak ke khilaaf ek maahaul nirmaan hua
 i heartily congratulate my sisters who are fighting this movement against the triple talaq, and i am sure that in helping them in their fight for the empowerment of mothers and sisters, Will do
 hindustan puri madad karegaa or Women Empowerment ke is mahatvapurn kadam main wo safal hoke rahegi; aisa mujhe puraa bharosa he
 My dear countrymen, sometimes in the name of faith, in the absence of patience some people do such things, which spoil the fabric of society
 desh shanti, sadbhaavna or ekta se chalata he
 The poison of casteism, the poison of communalism, can never benefit the country
 ye to gandhi kii bhoomi he, buddha kii bhoomi he, sabko saath le karke chalanaa; ye is desh kii samskruti or parampara kaa hissaa he
 We have to carry it forward successfully, and hence violence cannot be stressed in the name of faith
 aspataal main to patient ke saath kuch ho jaae, aspataal jala diya jaae; aksmaat ho jaae, gaadiyaan jala diya jaaen; andolan karen, sarkari sampatti ko jala diya jaae; aaazaad hindustan ke liye ye kiskaa he? hamaare sava sau karod deshavaasiyon kii sampatti he
 Whose cultural heritage is this? This is the cultural heritage of 1
25 billion countrymen
 ye aasthaa kiski he? ham sava sau karod deshavaasiyon kii aasthaa he; or isliye aasthaa ke naam par hinsa kaa rasta, is desh main kabhi bhi chal nahin saktaa, yah desh kabhi sweekaar nahin kar saktaa he
 And so i will urge the countrymen, at that time there was the slogan 'quit India', today the slogan is 'add India'
 vyakti-vyakti ko hamane saath lenaa he, jan-jan ko saath lenaa he, samaaj ke har tabake ko saath lenaa he, or usee ko le karke hamen desh ko aage badhanaa he
 We need a strong economy to build a prosperous India
 santulit vikaas chahie, next generation infrastructure chahie, tab ja kar ke hamaare sapanom ke bharat ko ham apni ankhon ke saamne dekh sakate hai
 Brothers and sisters, we have taken countless decisions in three years
 kuch chizon ko notice kiya gaya he or kuch chijen shaayad notice main nahin ai
 But one thing is important
 jab aap itnaa bada badlaav karte he to rukvaaten aati hai, gati ruk jaati he
 But see the working style of this government, if the train also passes near a railway station, when the track changes, the speed running from 60 has to be brought to the speed of 30
 trek badalane par train kii speed kam ho jaati he
 We are trying to take the whole country to a new track, but we have not let his speed down, we have kept his pace
 chaahe GST laaen ho, koi bhi kanoon laaen ho, koi bhi nai vyavastha laae ho, ham usko karne main safal hue he or aage bhi isko ham karenge
 We have laid emphasis on infrastructure
 abhootpurv kharch infrastructure par die ja rahe hai
 The railway station should be modernized, in a small town, whether to build an airport, whether to arrange water-way, whether to arrange roadways, whether to build gas grid, whether to grid water, whether to do optical fiber network , We are giving full emphasis on all types of modern infrastructure
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, 21veen sadi main bharat ko aage badhaane kaa sabase urjavan kshetra he, hamaara purvi hindustan
 There is so much potential, powerful human resource, immense natural wealth, rich of hard work, and ability to change life by resolving
 hamaara puraa dhyaan purvi uttar pradesh, bihar, bengal, assam, north east, odisha, ye hamaare aise samarthyavan rajya hai, jahaan prakritik sampada bharpoor he, usko aage badhaakar ke desh ko ek nai oonchai par le jane kii disha main ham prayatnrat he
 Brothers and sisters, corruption-free India is a very important task, we are trying to strengthen it
 sarkaar banane ke baad pehla kaam kiya tha SIT banane kaa
 Today, after three years, i want to tell the countrymen, proudly tell them that within three years, we have discovered more than about 1
25 lakh crore rupees of black money, caught it and suurender it
 Is forced
 uske baad hamane notebandi kaa faisla kiya
 We have achieved many significant successes through demonetisation
 jo kalaadhan chipa hua tha, usko mukhyadhara main aana padaa
 You must have seen that we sometimes used to extend 07 days-10 days-15 days, sometimes at the petrol pump, sometimes at the drugstore, sometimes at the railway station, we continued to take old notes, because our effort was once Money should also become a part of the formal economy in the banks and we have successfully completed that work
 or iskaa kaaran yah hua he ki abhi jo research hua he, kareeb teen lakh karod rupye
 
 
 This government has not done research, outside experts have done it
 notebandi ke baad teen lakh karod rupye, jo atirikt, jo kabhi banking system main waapas nahin aata tha wo aayaa he
 More than a quarter of a million rupees in the amount deposited in banks is under suspicion
 kam se kam do lakh karod rupye se zyada kalaadhan usko bainko tak pahunchnaa padaa he or ab vyavastha ke saath unako apana jawaab dene ke liye majaboor hue hai
 The new black money has also come to a great halt
 is varsh, iskaa parinaam dekhie, 01 april se 05 agast tak income tax return daakhil karne vaale nae vyaktigat karadaataaon kii sankhya 56 lakh
 In the same period last year, this number was only 2
2 million
 Double se bhi zyada! ye kaaran kaledhan ke khilaaf hamaari ladaai kaa parinaam he
 More than 18 lakh people have been identified, whose income is more than the book according to them, they are uncountable and hence they have to answer this difference
 saadhe chaar lakh log isamen se ab maidan main aaye hai, apni galati sweekaar karke raste main aane kaa prayaas kar rahe hai
 One lakh people have come forward, who had never heard of income tax in life, nor had ever given income tax, nor had they thought of it, but today they have to do it
 bhaaiyon bahanon, hamaare desh main agar do chaar companiyaan bhi kahin band ho jaae, to choubison ghante us par charchaaen hoti hai us par Debates hoti hai
 Economy is over


 it is done, no matter what happens! You'd be surprised to know, black money traders, Shell used to run companies and after demonetisation when data-mining was done
 tab teen lakh aisi companiyaan pai gayi hai, jo sirf or sirf shell companiyaan hai
 Does hawala business
 teen lakh, koi kalpana kar saktaa he
 And we have canceled the registration of one and a half lakh from that
 paanch companiyaan band ho jaae to hindustan main tufaan much jaataa he
 Locked up to twenty two lakh companies
 desh kaa maal luutane waalon ko jawaab dena padegaa, ye kaam hamane kar ke dikhaaya
 You will be surprised! Some shell companies are such that four hundred and four hundred companies were running at the same address, brothers and sisters
 chaar sau chaar sau companiyaan chal rahi thim
 Nobody was going to see, nobody was going to ask
 sari mileebhagat chal rahi thi
 And so my brothers and sisters, i have waged a very big fight against corruption black money
 desh kii bhalaai ke liye desh ke garibon ke kalyaan ke liye, desh ke naujavaanon ke bhavishya ko banane ke liye
 Brothers and sisters, one step after the other, and i am sure it will increase further after GST
 or Transparency aane vaali he
 Transportation alone Our truck used to go from one place to another
 ye GST ke baad tees pratishat uskaa samay batch gaya he
 Thousands of crores of rupees have been saved due to the end of check-post
 sabase badi bachat samay kii hui he
 In a way, its thirty percent efficiency is increasing
 aap kalpana kar sakate hai hindustan ke Transport jagat main tees pratishat Efficiency badhane kaa matlab kya hota he
 a GST has brought about such a big change
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, aaj notebandi ke kaaran bainko ke paas dhan aayaa he
 Banks are reducing their interest rate
 mudra ke dwaara saamaanya maanav ko bank se paisa mil rahaa he
 The common man is getting an opportunity to stand on his feet
 garib ho, madhyavarg kaa vyakti ho ghar bananaa chahta he, to bank usko madad karne ke liye aage aa rahe hai, kam byaaj kii dar se aage aa rahe hai
 It is working towards accelerating the economy of the country
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, ab ye vakt badal chukaa he
 We are in the 21st century
 vishwa kaa sabase bada yuva varg hamaare desh main he
 Our identity in the world is by IT, by Digital World
 kya ab bhi ham usee pooraani soch main rahenge
 Hey! Once upon a time, leather coins used to move, slowly disappeared, no one was asking
 aaj jo kaagaj ke note hai, samay aate rahete wo sara kaa sara Digital Currency main Convert hone vaala he
 Let us lead, let us take responsibility, let us go towards Digital Transaction
 ham BHIM APP ko apanaaen, aarthik kaarobaar kaa hissaa banaaen
 We also work through Prepaid
 or mujhe khushi he ki Digital lenden badi he
 It has increased by 34 percent over the previous year and about 44 percent in prepaid payments
 or isaliye kam cash vaali arthvyavastha, usko lekar ke hamen aage badhanaa chahie
 My dear countrymen, there are some schemes of the government that can save money in the pockets of the common man of India
 agar aap LED Bulb lagaate hai, to saal bhar kaa hajaar do hajaar paanch hajaar rupaya aapkaa bachane vaala he
 If you succeed in a clean India, then the poor's medicine of seven thousand rupees stops
 mahangaai par niyantran, aapke badhate hue kharch ko rokane main safal hua he, ek prakaar se aapaki bachat he
 Affordable medicine shops have become a huge blessing for the poor through 'jan Aushadhi Kendras'
 hamaare yahaan Operation ke peeche, stent ke peeche jo kharch hote the wo kam hue hai
 In the coming days, all facilities will also be available for Knee's operation
 hamaari koshish he ki garib or madhyamvarg ke maanav ke liye ye kharch kam ho or uske liye ham ek ke baad ek kadam uthaa rahe hai
 Earlier, dialysis used to take place in the headquarters of the states in our country
 hamane tay kiya hindustan ke jila kendron tak Dialysis pahunchaayenge
 Nearly three and a half hundred and four hundred districts have been reached and by dialysis for free, we are working to save the life of the poor
 aaj desh garv kar saktaa he ki hamane vishwa ke saamne apni vyavasthaaon ko viksit kiya he
 Today we have succeeded in arranging NAVIC Navigation through GPS System
 hamane SAARC Satellite ke dwaara hamane padosi deshon ke saath madad karne kaa safal abhiyaan kiya he
 We are delivering our importance inside the world today by 'tejas' airplane
 ‘BHIM-AADHAR App’ duniya ke andar Digital Transaction ke liye ek ajooba bana hua he
 rupay Card
 
 
 hindustan main rupay Card karodon kii taadaad main he
 And if it becomes operational, if it is in the pocket of the poor, then it will become the largest in the world
 or isaliye mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, meraa aapse yahi aagrah he ki ham ‘new India’ kaa sankalp le kar ke aage badhen, samay rahete hue karen
 It is said in our scriptures: Aniyat Kaal: Aniyat Kaal: Prabhutyo Viplavante, Prabhutayo Viplavante
 sahi samay par agar koi kaary puraa nahin kiya gaya, to phir icchit parinaam kabhi nahin milte hai
 And so for 'team India', for Team India of 1
25 billion countrymen, today we have to pledge to make 'new India' by 2022 and we will do this work ourselves, no one will do it, we will do it ourselves
 desh ke liye karenge, pehle se acha karenge, pehle se zyada karenge, samarpan bhav se karenge, 2022 main ‘bhavy-divya’ hindustan dekhne ke liye karenge
 And that's why we will all together create an India where the poor have a pucca house, electricity, water
 ham sab milakar ek aisa bharat banaaenge, jahaan desh kaa kisaan chintaa main nahin chaiyn se soyega
 By 2022, he will earn twice as much as he is earning today
 ham sab milakar ke ek aisa hindustan banaaenge, jahaan yuvaaon, mahilaon ko apane sapane puure karne ke liye bharpoor avasar uplabdh honge
 Together we will create an India that will be free from terrorism, communalism and casteism
 ham sab milakar ke ek aisa bharat banaaenge, jahaan bhrashtachar or bhai-bhatijawad se koi samjhauta nahin hoga
 Together we will create an India that will be clean, healthy and fulfill the dream of Swaraj
 or isaliye mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, ham sab milakar ke vikaas kii is daud main aage chalane kaa prayaas karenge
 Today, after 70 years of independence, in the midst of waiting for 75 years of independence, in the important tenure of five years, all of us countrymen should go with the dream of a 'divine-grand India', with this same sentiment i once again i bow to the crazy people
 sava sau karod deshavaasiyon ke nae vishwaas, nai umang ko naman karata hum
 And call upon 'team India' to move forward with a new resolution
 isi bhaavana ke saath aap sabko hriday se meri bahut bahut shubhakamanaayen
 Bharat Mata Ki Jai, Vande Mataram Jai Hind
 jai hind, jai hind, jai hind, jai hind
 Bharat Mata Ki Jai, Bharat Mata Ki Jai, Bharat Mata Ki Jai
 vande maataram, vande maataram, vande maataram, vande maataram
 The comments sabhi kaa bahut bahut dhanyavad
 Sincerely: PIB Technology kii madad se, desh main eemaandaaree ko bal dene kaa ham logon kaa bharpoor prayaas he
 Our fight against black money will continue
 bhrashtchaar ke khilaaf hamaari ladaai jari rahegi
 And we have gradually made many unsuccessful efforts towards bringing transparency, connecting the AADHAR system by interveneing technology and many people in the world discuss and study this model of India
 sarkaar main bhi kharidi karne main ab chota-sa vyakti bhi hajaaron kilometre dur baitha gaanv kaa vyakti bhi sarkaar ko apana maal supply kar saktaa he, apane product supply kar saktaa he
 He does not need an elder, he does not need a middleman
 GEM naam kaa ek portal banaaya he, GEM uske dwaara government procure kar rahi he
 It has been successful in bringing a lot of transparency
 bhaiyon-bahanon, sarkari kii yojanaon main raftaar badi he
 When the government is delayed in some work, it is not just the project delay
 wo sirf dhan ke kharchen se judaa hua vishay nahin hota he
 When any work gets stuck, stops, then my poor families suffer the most
 mere bhaiyo-bahanon ko hota he
 We can reach Mangalyaan within nine months
 yah hamaara samarthy he
 Mangalyaan can be reached from here within nine months
 lekin maine ek baar sarkaar ke kaam kaa lekha-jokha har maheene letaa rahata hum
 Once such a thing came to my attention, a 42-year-old project, a 70-72 km project, stuck on the rail for 42 years, was hanging
 bhaiyon-bahanon nau maheene main mangalayan pahunchane kaa samarthy rakhane vaala meraa desh 42 saal tak 70-72 kilometre ek rail kii patari na bicha sake, tab garib ke man main sawaal uthta he ki mere desh kaa kya hoga? or aisi chizon par hamane dhyaan diya he
 To change these things, we have tried to bring changes in them by adding all these things, be it the subject of new technology, geo-technology, space-technology
 aapane dekha hoga ek samay tha jab uria ke liye rajya or centre main tanaav chalata tha
 For kerosene, the state and center were tense
 ek aisa maahaul tha, jaise centre bada bhai, rajya chota bhai he
 The direction we worked from day one, because i have been the Chief Minister for a long time, so i know how important states are in the development of the country
 mukhyamantriyon kaa kitna mahatv he, rajyon kii sarkaron kaa kitna mahatv he, isko main bhalee-bhaanti samajhataa hum or isliye Co-operative Federalism or ab Competitive Co-operative Federalism us par hamane bal diya he or aapane dekha hoga ki aaj mil karke saare nirnay, ham mil karke kar rahe hai
 You will remember that from the ramparts of this Red Fort, once the Prime Minister discussed the plight of the power companies of the states of the country
 laal kile par se chintaa vyakt kerani padi thi
 Today, by taking the states together with the 'uday Yojana', by giving strength to the states, these problems were there in the business of the power factories, working together to solve it, this is a great proof of Federalism
 GST ke saath-saath chaahe Smart City ke nirmaan kii baat ho, chaahe swatchta kaa abhiyaan ho, chaahe toilet kii charchaa ho, Ease of doing Business kii baat ho, yah saare vishay aise hai ki hamaare desh ke sabhi rajya kandhe se kandhaa mila karke aaj bharat ke saath bharat kii sarkaar, kandhe se kandhaa mila karke rajya ke saath chalane main bahut safal ho rahi he
 My dear countrymen 'new India' is our greatest strength, democracy
 lekin ham jaanate hai ki hamane loktantr ko mat-patr tak simit kar diya he
 Democracy cannot be limited to ballot papers
 or isliye ham ‘new India’ main us loktantr par bal dena chaahate hai jisamen tantra se lok nahin, lekin logon se tantra chale, aisa loktantr ‘new India’ kii pahchaan bane, us disha main ham janaa chaahate hai
 Lokmanya Tilak ji had said, 'swarajya is my birth right'
 aaazaad bharat me ham sabakaa mantra hona chahie, ‘surajya meraa janmasiddh adhikaar he’
 'state' should be the responsibility of all of us
 naagarik ko apni jimmedaariyaan nibhaani chahie, sarkaron ne apni jimmedaariyaan nibhaani chahie
 When we have to walk from 'swarajya to Surajya', the countrymen do not stay back
 jab maine gas sabsidi chhodane ke liye kaha, desh aage aayaa
 Speaking of cleanliness, even today, in every corner of India, some one is carrying forward the cleanliness drive
 jab notebandi kii baat ai, duniya ko aashcharya hua tha, yahaan tak log kah rahe the, ab modi gaya
 But the patience of the 125 crore countrymen who showed in demonetisation, the faith that they told and the result of that, today we are succeeding in taking steps against corruption
 hamaare desh ke liye is nai lokbhagidaari kii parampara
 
 
 It is our effort to advance the country by public participation
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, laal bahadur shastri ne jai jawan jai kisaan kaa mantra diya tha
 The farmer of our country has never looked back, our farmer is giving record crop production today
 prakritik aapadaaon ke bich main nai–nai siddhiyaan wo hasil kar rahaa he
 There has been a record production of pulses and my dear brothers and sisters, my farmer brothers and sisters, there has never been a tradition of buying pulses in government in India and once in a while, according to thousands of tons It used to be, this time when the farmers of my country produced pulses and served nutritious food to the poor, the government increased this work by doing the historic work of buying 16 lakh tons of pulses Have received
 pradhanmantri fasal beemaa yojana, ek suraksha kavach mere kisaan bhaiyon ko mila he
 Three years ago, only 1
25 crore farmers used to take advantage of this Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, which was earlier known by another name
 aaj pradhanmantri fasal beemaa yojana main itane kam samay main kai naye kisaan iske saath jud gaye hai or kareeb-kareeb ye sankhya aage chalakar ke paune chah karod par pahunchi he
 The Prime Minister Agricultural Irrigation Scheme, if the farmer gets water, has the power to produce gold from the soil and so to provide water to the farmer last time i told the Red Fort, we have completed 21 of those schemes and the rest 50 plans will be completed in the coming time
 or total 99 yojanaon kaa maine sankalp liya he
 We will complete the water supply to the farmer's farm by completing those 99 big plans before 2019
 or kisaan ko beej se bazaar tak, jab tak ham vyastha nahin dete hai, hamaare kisaan ke bhagya ko ham nahin badal sakate hai
 And therefore it needs infrastructure, it needs supply-chain
 har saal lakhon-karodon rupayon kii hamaari sabji, hamaare fal, hamaari fasal barbaad ho jaati he or isliye usko badalane ke liye ek to Foreign Direct Investment ko badhaava diya taaki food processing ke andar duniya hamaare saath jude
 Promoted to create infrastructure and Government of India has implemented 'pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojana'
 jiske kaaran un vyavasthaaon kaa nirmaan kiya jayega jo beej se bazaar tak kisaan ko hand-holding karenge, vyavasthaaen viksit karenge or hamaare karodon kisaanon kii jindagi main ek nayaa badlaav laane main ham safal honge
 Due to Demand and Technology, the nature of job is also changing in our country
 rojgaar se judi yojanaon main, training ke tareeke main 21veen sadi kii aavashyaktaaon ke anusaar, maanav sansaadhan ke vikaas ke liye bharat sarkaar ne anek nai yojanaayen haath main lee hai
 a huge campaign has been launched to ensure that the youth get money from banks without guarantee
 hamaara noujvaan apane pairon par khadaa ho, wo rojgaar paane vaala rahe, rojgaar dene vaala bane, or pichley teen saal main dekha he ki ‘pradhanmantri mudra yojana’ ke kaaran karodon noujvaan apane pairon par khadey hue hai
 Not only this, a young man is also employing one or two to three more people
 shiksha ke kshetra main World Class Universities banane ke liye hamane bandhanon se mukti dene kaa ek bada ahm kadam uthaaya he
 20 Universities have been called upon to decide their fate, Government will not come anywhere
 upar se sarkaar 1000 karod rupee tak kii madad karne ke liye bhi taiyaar he
 Has given a call, i am sure the educational institutions of my country will definitely come forward and make it successful
 pichley teen varsh main 6 IIT, 7 nae IIM, 8 nae IIIT, iskaa nirmaan kiya he or shiksha ko naukari ke avasaron ke saath jodne kaa bhi is ko kaam hamane kiya he
 My mothers, sisters, today, in large quantities, women in the family also go for employment
 or isliye raatri ko bhi unako rojgaar kaa avasar mili, factoriyon main kaam karne kaa avasar mili, isliye Labour Laws main parivartan karne kaa bahut bada ahm kadam uthaaya he
 Our mothers and sisters are also an important unit of the family
 hamaara bhavishya nirmaan karne ke liye hamaari maataaon, bahanon kaa yogadan bahut bada hota he, or isliye Maternity Leave jo 12 saptaah kii thi, wo 26 saptaah, usamen aay chaalu rahegi, is prakaar se dene kaa kaam kiya he
 With regard to the work of empowerment of our women today, in particular, i would like to congratulate the sisters who have been forced to live a very difficult life due to triple talaq
 koi aashray nahin bachaa he, or aisi peedit, teen-talaak se peedit bahanon ne puure desh main ek andolan khadaa kiya he
 The intellectual class of the country was shaken, the media of the country also helped them, an atmosphere was created against triple talaq in the whole country
 is andolan ko chalaane vaali un meri bahanon ko, jo teen-talaak ke khilaaf ladai lard rahi hai, main hriday se unka abhindann karata hum or mujhe vishwaas he, ki maataaon-bahanon ko adhikaar dilaane main, unki is ladaai main hindustan unki puri madad karegaa
 Hindustan will help and it will be successful in this important step of Women Empowerment; i am sure of this
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyo, kabhi-kabhi aasthaa ke naam par dhairya ke abhaav main kuch log aisi chijen kar baithte hai, jo samaaj ke taane-bane ko bikher detii hai
 The country operates with peace, goodwill and unity
 jatvaad kaa jehar, sampradayawad kaa jehar, desh kaa kabhi bhala nahin kar saktaa he
 This is Gandhi's land, Buddha's land, take everyone along and walk; It is part of the culture and tradition of this country
 hamen isko safalataa se aage badhanaa he, or isliye aasthaa ke naam par hinsa ko bal nahin diya ja saktaa he
 If something happens to the patient in the hospital, the hospital is burnt; Accidentally, carts should be burnt; Move, government property be burned; Whose is this for Azad Hindustan? We have assets of 1
25 billion countrymen
 ye saanskrithik viraasat kiski he? ye ham sava sau karod deshavaasiyon kii saanskrithik viraasat he
 Whose faith is this? We are the faith of 125 crore countrymen; And so the path of violence in the name of faith can never go on in this country, this country can never accept
 or isliye main deshavaasiyon se aagrah karuunga, us samay ‘bharat chodo’ kaa naaraa tha, aaj naaraa he ‘bharat jodo’
 We have to take person-to-person, take people-to-people, we have to take every section of the society together, and we have to take the country forward by taking the same
 samrudh bharat banane ke liye hamaari majboot arthvyavastha chahie
 We need balanced development, next generation infrastructure, then we can see the India of our dreams in front of our eyes
 bhaaiyo-bahanon, anginat nirnay hamane teen saal main liye
 Some things have been noted and some things may not have come into notice
 lekin ek baat mahatvapurn he
 When you make such a big change, the stops come, the speed stops
 lekin is sarkaar kii kaaryastylee dekhie, agar train bhi kisi railway stesan ke paas se guzarati he, jab trek badalati he to 60 se chalane vaali speed ko usko 30 kii speed main laana padataa he
 The speed of the train decreases by changing the track
 ham puure desh ko ek nae trek par le jane kaa prayaas kar rahe hai, lekin hamane uski speed kam nahin hone di he, hamane uski gati ko barkaraar rakhaa he
 Whether we bring GST, any law, any new system, we have succeeded in doing that and we will do it in future
 hamane infrastructure par bal diya he
 Unprecedented expenses are being given on infrastructure
 railway stesan kaa aadhunikeekaran ho, chote shahar main, chaahe airport bananaa ho, chaahe water-way kii vyavastha kerani ho, chaahe roadways kii vyavastha kerani ho, chaahe gas grid banani ho, chaahe pani kii grid karaani ho, chaahe optical fibre network karnaa ho, har prakaar ke aadhunik infrastructure par ham purna bal de rahe hai
 My dear countrymen, our eastern India is the most energetic field to advance India in the 21st century
 itnaa potential he, samarthyavan maanav sansaadhan he, apaar prakritik sampada he, parishram ke dhani hai, sankalp karke jindagi badalane kaa samarthy rakhte hai
 Our entire focus is on eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Bengal, Assam, North East, Odisha, these are our powerful states, where natural wealth is abundant, we are trying to take the country to a new height by taking it forward
 bhaaiyo-bahanon, bhrashtachar mukt bharat ek bada ahm kaam he, usko ham bal dene kaa prayaas kar rahe he
 After the formation of the government, the first task was to create SIT
 aaj teen saal ke baad main deshavaasiyon ko bataanaa chahta hum, garv se bataanaa chahta hum ki teen saal ke bheetar-bheetar, kareeb-kareeb sava lakh karod rupye se bhi zyada kalaadhan ko hamane khoj diya he, usko pakadaa he or usko suurender karne ke liye majaboor kiya he
 After that we decided to demonetise
 notebandi ke dwaara hamane anek mahatvapurn safaltaaen praapt kii hai
 The black money that was hidden had to come into the mainstream
 aapane dekha hoga ki ham kabhi 07 din-10 din-15 din badhaate jate the, kabhi petrol pump par, kabhi dawaai kii dukaan par, kabhi railway stesan par puraane note lene kaa silsilaa jari rakhte the, kyonki hamaara prayaas tha ki ek baar jo bhi dhan aae wo bainkon main formal economy kaa hissaa ban jaae or us kaam ko hamane safaltaapurvak paar kiya he
 And the reason for this is that the research that has been done now, is about three lakh crore rupees
 
 
 ye sarkaar ne research nahin kii he, baahar ke expert ne kii he
 Three lakh crore rupees after demonetisation, the additional, which never came back in the banking system, has come
 bainkon main jamaa kii gai raashi main paune do lakh karod se adhik raashi shaq ke ghere main he
 At least two lakh crore rupees of black money has had to reach the banks and now they are forced to give their answers with the system
 nae kaledhan par bhi bahut badi rukaawat aa gai he
 This year, see the result, 56 lakh new taxpayers filing income tax returns from 01 April to 05 August
 pichley saal usee avadhi main ye sankhya sirf 22 lakh thi
 More than double! These reasons are the result of our fight against black money
 18 lakh se zyada aise logon ko pahchaan liya gaya he, jinaki aay unke hisaab kitaab se kuch zyada he, beshumaar zyada he or isaliye is antar kaa unako jawaab dena pad rahaa he
 Out of this, four and a half lakh people have now come to the field, accepting their mistake and trying to get in the way
 ek lakh log aise saamne aae hai, jinhone kabhi jindagi main Income Tax kaa naam bhi nahin suna tha, na Income Tax kabhi diya tha, na kabhi unhone us par sochaa tha, lekin aaj unako wo karnaa pad rahaa he
 Brothers and sisters, if two or four companies are shut down in our country, then there are discussions on them round the clock
 arthniti khatm ho gai


 ye ho gaya, na jane kya kya hota he! aapako jaanakar ke hairaani hogi, kaale dhan ke kaarobaari, Shell companiyaan chalaate the or notebandi ke baad jab data-mining kiya gaya
 Then three lakh such companies have been found, which are just and shell companies only
 hawala kaa kaarobaar karti hai
 Three lakhs, one can imagine
 or usamen se paune do lakh kaa registration hamanen Cancel kar diya he
 If five companies are closed, then there is a storm in India
 paune do lakh companiyon ko taale laga diye
 Those who looted the goods of the country will have to answer, we did this by doing this
 aapako hairaani hogi! kuch to shell companiyaan aisi hai, jo ek hi Address par chaar sau chaar sau companiyaan chal rahi thim, bhaaiyon bahanon
 Four hundred and four hundred companies were operating
 koi dekhne vaala nahin tha, koi poochne vaala nahin tha
 All the collusion was going on
 or isaliye mere bhaaiyon bahanon, maine bhrashtachar kaale dhan ke khilaaf ek bahut badi ladaai chhedi he
 For the betterment of the country, for the welfare of the poor of the country, for the future of the youth of the country
 bhaaiyon bahanon, ek ke baad ek kadam or mujhe vishwaas he GST ke baad usamen or badhotaree hone vaali he
 And Transparency is forthcoming
 akele Transportation hamaara trek vaala ek sthaan se duusare sthaan par jaataa tha
 After this GST, thirty percent of his time is saved
 check-post khatm hone ke kaaran hajaaron karod rupayon kii to bachat hui he
 The biggest savings have been time
 ek prakaar se uski tees pratishat Efficiency bad rahi he
 You can imagine what it means to increase thirty percent efficiency in the transport world of India
 ek GST ke kaaran itnaa bada parivartan aayaa he
 My dear countrymen, today money has come to banks due to demonetisation
 bank apni byaaj dar kam kar rahe hai
 The common man is getting money from the bank through currency
 saamaanya maanav ko apane pairon par khadey hone ke liye avasar mil rahaa he
 Be poor, a middle class person wants to build a house, then banks are coming forward to help him, coming at a lower rate of interest
 ye sara desh ke arthtantr ko gati dene kii disha main kaam kar rahaa he
 My dear countrymen, now is the time
 ham 21veen sadi main hai
 The largest youth group in the world is in our country
 duniya main hamaari pahchaan IT ke dwaara he, Digital World ke dwaara he
 Will we still remain in the same old thinking? are! ek jamaane main chamade ke sikke chalate the, dhire-dhire lupt ho gaye, koi poochne vaala nahin rahaa
 Today the paper notes are going to be converted into digital currency all the time
 ham netritv karen, ham jimmevary len, ham Digital Transaction kii ore jaaen
 We adopt BHIM APP, become part of economic business
 ham Prepaid ke dwaara bhi kaam karen
 And i am happy that Digital transactions have grown
 pichley saal ke mukaable usamen 34 pratishat kaa ijapha hua he or Prepaid bhugtan main kareeb 44 pratishat kaa
 And that's why we should go ahead with a low cash economy
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, sarkaar kii kuch yojanaayen aisi hai, jo hindustan ke saamaanya maanav kii jeb main paise bachaa saken
 If you put an LED bulb, then a thousand rupees two thousand five thousand rupees of the year are going to save you
 agar aap svachh bharat main safal hote hai, to garib kaa saat hajaar kaa rupaya dawaai kaa band hota he
 Controlling inflation has been successful in curbing your rising expenses, in a way your savings
 ‘jan aushadhi kendron’ ke dwaara sasti dawaai kii dukaan garib ke liye ek bahut bada aashirwad bani he
 The expenses that were behind our operation, behind the stent, have come down
 aane vaale dinon main Knee ke Operation ke liye bhi sari suvidhaayen milengi
 Our effort is to reduce these expenses for the poor and middle class human beings and for that we are taking steps one after the other
 pehle hamaare desh main rajyon ke mukhyalay main Dialysis hua karata tha
 We decided to deliver dialysis to the district centers of India
 kareeb saadhe teen sau, chaar sau jilon tak pahunchaa diya or muft main Dialysis karke garib kii jindagi bachaane kaa kaam ham kar rahe hai
 Today the country can be proud that we have developed our systems in front of the world
 GPS System ke dwaara NAVIC Navigation kii vyavastha aaj karne main ham safal hue hai
 Through SAARC Satellite, we have successfully campaigned to help with neighboring countries
 ham ‘tejas’ hawaii jahaaj ke dwaara aaj duniya ke andar apni ahmiyat pahunchaa rahe hai
 The 'BHIM-AADHAR App' is a wonder within the world for Digital Transaction
 rupay Card 
 
 
 In India, rupay Card is worth crores
 or agar wo operational ho jayega, wo agar garibon ke jeb main he, to duniya kaa, ye sabase bada ho jayega
 And that's why my dear countrymen, i request you to move ahead by taking a pledge for 'new India', and do it in time
 hamaare yahaan shastron main kaha gaya haih aniyat kaal:, aniyat kaalah prabhutayo viplavante, prabhutayo viplavante
 If a task is not completed at the right time, then the desired result is never achieved
 or isaliye ‘team India’ ke liye, sava sau karod deshavaasiyon kii team India ke liye, aaj hamen sankalp lenaa hoga 2022 tak ‘new India’ banane kaa or ye kaam ham khud karenge, koi karegaa aisa nahin, ham khud karenge
 Will do for the country, will do better than before, will do more than before, will do it with dedication, in 2022 to see 'grand-divine' Hindustan
 or isaliye ham sab milakar ke ek aisa bharat banaaenge jahaan garib ke paas pakkaa ghar ho, bijli ho, pani ho
 Together we will create an India where the farmer of the country will sleep peacefully
 aaj wo jitna kama rahaa he, usase 2022 tak doguna kamayega
 Together we will create an India where youth and women will have ample opportunities to fulfill their dreams
 ham sab milakar ke ek aisa bharat banaaenge, jo aatankwaad sampradayawad or jatvaad se mukt hoga
 Together we will create an India where there will be no compromise on corruption and nepotism
 ham sab milakar ke ek aisa bharat banaaenge, jo svachh hoga, swasth hoga or swaraj ke sapane ko puraa karegaa
 And therefore my dear countrymen, we will all try to work together in this race of development
 aaj aazaadee ke 70 saal ke baad, aazaadee ke 75 saal kii pratiksha ke bich paanch saal ke mahatvapurn kaarykaal main ek ‘divya-bhavy bharat’ ke sapane ko lekar ke ham sabhi deshvasi chalem, isi ek bhav ke saath main phir ek baar aazaadee ke diwaanon ko pranaam karata hum
 i salute the new faith, new zeal of 1
25 billion countrymen
 or nae sankalp ke saath aage chalane ke liye ‘team India’ ko aahvaan karata hum
 With this feeling, my heartiest greetings to all of you

 saabhaar: PIB Now, even a small person sitting in the government, thousands of kilometers away, can also supply his goods and supply his products to the government
 usko bade kii jarurat nahin he, bichauliye kii jarurat nahin he
 a portal named GEM has been created, GEM is doing government procurement by him
 bahut sari maatra main transparency laane main safalataa mili he
 Ladies & Gentlemen, the speed of government schemes has increased
 jab sarkaar, kisi kaam main vilamb ho jaataa he, to sirf wo project vilamb nahin hota
 It is not just a matter related to the expenditure of money
 jab koi bhi kaam atak jaataa he, ruuk jaataa he to sabase zyada nuksaan mere garib pariwaron ko hota he
 My brothers and sisters
 ham nau maheene ke bheetar-bheetar mangalayan pahunch sakate hai
 This is our strength
 nau maheene ke bheetar-bheetar yahaan se mangalayan pahunch sakate hai
 But once every month i keep an account of the work of the government
 ek baar aisi baat mere dhyaan main ai, 42 saal purana ek project, 70-72 kilometre kaa project, rail kaa 42 saal se atka padaa, lataka padaa tha
 Brothers and sisters, my country, which has the ability to reach Mangalyaan in nine months, cannot lay a rail track for 70-72 kilometers for 42 years, then the question arises in the mind of the poor that what will happen to my country? And we have focused on such things
 in chizon main badlaav laane ke liye hamane nai-nai technology geo-technology kaa vishay ho, space-technology kaa vishay ho in sari chizon ko jod karke hamane usamen parivartan laane kaa prayaas kiya he
 You must have seen a time when there was tension in the state and center for urea
 kerosene ke liye rajya or centre ke liye tanaav chalata tha
 There was an atmosphere like the center is the elder brother, the state is the younger brother
 hamane pehle din se jis disha main kaam kiya, kyonki lambe arase se mukhyamantri rahaa hum, isliye mujhe pataa he ki desh ke vikaas main rajyon kii kitni ahmiyat he
 i understand the importance of the Chief Ministers, how important the Governments of the States are, and therefore Co-operative Federalism and now Competitive Co-operative Federalism we have emphasized that and you must have seen that today all the decisions together , We are doing it together
 aapako yaad hoga isi lalakile kii pracheer se ek baar desh ke rajyo kii bijli companiyon kii durdasha kii charchaa ek pradhanmantri ne kii thi

 Along with the GST, whether it is about the construction of Smart City, whether it is a campaign for cleanliness, whether it is a discussion of toilet, ease of doing business, all these subjects are such that all the states of our country join shoulder to shoulder
 Today, the Government of India is being very successful in running shoulder to shoulder with the state
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyon ‘new India’ hamaari sabase badi takat he, loktantr he
 But we know that we have limited democracy to the ballot paper
 loktantr mat-patr tak simit nahin ho saktaa
 And that is why we want to emphasize on democracy in 'new India' in which the system is not public, but the people should have the system, so that democracy should become the identity of 'new India', we want to go in that direction
 lokmaanya tilak ji ne kaha tha, ‘swarajya meraa janmasiddh adhikaar he’
 The mantra of all of us in independent India should be, 'state is my rightful birth'
 ‘surajya’ ham sabakaa daayitv hona chahie
 Citizens should carry out their responsibilities, governments should fulfill their responsibilities
 ‘swarajya se surajya’ kii ore jab chalanaa he, to deshvasi peeche nahin rahete
 When i asked to give up the gas subsidy, the country came forward
 swatchta kii baat kahi, aaj bhi hindustan ke har kone main koi na koi swatchta ke abhiyaan ko aage badha rahaa he
 When it came to demonetisation, the world was surprised, even people were saying, now Modi has gone
 lekin notebandi main sava sau karod deshavaasiyon ne jis dhairya ko dikhaaya, jis vishwaas ko bataaya or usee kaa parinaam he ki aaj bhrashtachar ke khilaaf nakel lagane main ham ek ke baad kadam uthaane main safal ho rahe hai
 This new tradition of public participation for our country
 
 
 janabhagidaari se hi desh ko aage badhaane main hamaara prayaas he
 My dear countrymen, Lal Bahadur Shastri gave the mantra of Jai Jawan Jai Kisan
 hamaare desh ke kisaan ne peeche mud ke kabhi dekha nahin, record fasal utpaadan aaj hamaara kisaan karke de rahaa he
 In the midst of natural disasters, he is getting new achievements
 daal kaa record utpaadan hua he or mere pyaare bhaiyo bahanon, mere kisaan bhaiyo bahanon, hindustan main kabhi bhi sarkaar main daal kharidne kii parampara hi nahin rahi he or kabhi ek-aadh baar kiya ho to hajaaron main hi hajaaron ton ke hisaab ke hisaab se hota tha, is baar jab mere desh ke kisaanon ne daal utpaadan karke garib ko paushtik aahaar dene kaa kaam kiya, to 16 lakh ton daal, sarkaar ne kharidne kaa aitihaasik kaam karke is kaam ko badhaava diya
 Prime Minister Crop Insurance Scheme, a security shield has been provided to my farmer brothers
 teen saal pehle sirf sava teen karod kisaan is pradhanmantri fasal beemaa yojana, jo pehle duusare naam se chalati thi uskaa laabh lete the
 Today, in such a short time under the Prime Minister Crop Insurance Scheme, many new farmers have joined with it and almost these numbers have reached a further six crores
 pradhanmantri krishi sinchai yojana, kisaan ko agar pani mili to mitti main se sona paidaa karne kii takat rakhata he or isliye kisaan ko pani pahunchane ke liye maine pichhali baar lalakile se kaha tha, un yojaanaaon main se 21 yojana ham purna kar chuke hai or baaki 50 yojanaayen aane vaale kuch samay main purna ho jaaengi
 And i have resolved a total of 99 schemes
 2019 ke pehle un 99 badi-bady yojanaayen ko paripurna karke, kisaan ke khet tak pani pahunchane kaa kaam ham purna kar denge
 And we cannot change the fate of our farmer till we provide for the farmer from seed to market
 or isliye uske liye infrastructure chahie, uske liye supply-chain chahie
 Every year our vegetables, our fruits, our crops worth millions and billions are wasted and so to change that, one has encouraged Foreign Direct Investment so that the world can join us in food processing
 Infrastructure banane ke liye badhaava diya or bharat sarkaar ne ‘pradhanmantri kisaan sampada yojana’ lagu kii he
 Due to which arrangements will be made that will hand-hold the farmer from seed to market, develop systems and we will be successful in bringing a new change in the lives of our crores of farmers
 Demand or Technology ke kaaran, hamaare desh main nature of job main bhi bahut bada badlaav aa rahaa he

 Our youth should stand on their feet, they should get employment, become employable, and in the last three years we have seen that due to 'pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana', crores of youth have stood on their feet
 itnaa hi nahin, ek noujvaan ek yaa do teen or logon ko bhi rojgaar de rahaa he
 To create World Class Universities in the field of education, we have taken a major step to break free from bondage
 20 uniwarsitiyon kaa aahvaan kiya he ki aap apane bhagya kaa faisla kiijie, sarkaar kahin bich main nahin aegi
 From above the government is also ready to help up to 1000 crores rupees
 aahvaan kiya he, mujhe vishwaas he mere desh kii shiksha sansthaaon main jarur aage aaenge, isko safal karenge
 In the last three years, 6 iits, 7 new iims, 8 new iiits have been built, and we have also done this work to link education with job opportunities
 meri maatayen, bahanen aaj bahut badi maatra main, parivaar main mahilaayein bhi rojgaar ke liye jaati hai
 And so at night, they get employment opportunities, work in factories, so have taken a very important step to change Labor Laws
 hamaari maatayen, bahanen parivaar kii bhi ek ahm ikai hai
 The contribution of our mothers and sisters is huge to build our future, and so Maternity Leave, which was 12 weeks, will continue to have income in 26 weeks, thus giving has worked
 main aaj hamaari mahilaon ke shashaktikaran ke kaam ke sambandh main, main khaas karke, main un bahanon kaa abhinandan karnaa chahta hum jo teen talaak ke kaaran bahut hi durdavy jindagi jeene ke liye majaboor hui hai
 There is no shelter left, and such afflicted, triple-divorced sisters have started a movement across the country
 desh ke buddhijivi varg ko hilaa diya, desh ke media ne bhi unki madad kii, puure desh main teen-talaak ke khilaaf ek maahaul nirmaan hua
 i heartily congratulate my sisters who are fighting this movement against the triple talaq, and i am sure that in helping them in their fight for the empowerment of mothers and sisters, Will do
 hindustan puri madad karegaa or Women Empowerment ke is mahatvapurn kadam main wo safal hoke rahegi; aisa mujhe puraa bharosa he
 My dear countrymen, sometimes in the name of faith, in the absence of patience some people do such things, which spoil the fabric of society
 desh shanti, sadbhaavna or ekta se chalata he
 The poison of casteism, the poison of communalism, can never benefit the country
 ye to gandhi kii bhoomi he, buddha kii bhoomi he, sabko saath le karke chalanaa; ye is desh kii samskruti or parampara kaa hissaa he
 We have to carry it forward successfully, and hence violence cannot be stressed in the name of faith
 aspataal main to patient ke saath kuch ho jaae, aspataal jala diya jaae; aksmaat ho jaae, gaadiyaan jala diya jaaen; andolan karen, sarkari sampatti ko jala diya jaae; aaazaad hindustan ke liye ye kiskaa he? hamaare sava sau karod deshavaasiyon kii sampatti he
 Whose cultural heritage is this? This is the cultural heritage of 1
25 billion countrymen
 ye aasthaa kiski he? ham sava sau karod deshavaasiyon kii aasthaa he; or isliye aasthaa ke naam par hinsa kaa rasta, is desh main kabhi bhi chal nahin saktaa, yah desh kabhi sweekaar nahin kar saktaa he
 And so i will urge the countrymen, at that time there was the slogan 'quit India', today the slogan is 'add India'
 vyakti-vyakti ko hamane saath lenaa he, jan-jan ko saath lenaa he, samaaj ke har tabake ko saath lenaa he, or usee ko le karke hamen desh ko aage badhanaa he
 We need a strong economy to build a prosperous India
 santulit vikaas chahie, next generation infrastructure chahie, tab ja kar ke hamaare sapanom ke bharat ko ham apni ankhon ke saamne dekh sakate hai
 Brothers and sisters, we have taken countless decisions in three years
 kuch chizon ko notice kiya gaya he or kuch chijen shaayad notice main nahin ai
 But one thing is important
 jab aap itnaa bada badlaav karte he to rukvaaten aati hai, gati ruk jaati he
 But see the working style of this government, if the train also passes near a railway station, when the track changes, the speed running from 60 has to be brought to the speed of 30
 trek badalane par train kii speed kam ho jaati he
 We are trying to take the whole country to a new track, but we have not let his speed down, we have kept his pace
 chaahe GST laaen ho, koi bhi kanoon laaen ho, koi bhi nai vyavastha laae ho, ham usko karne main safal hue he or aage bhi isko ham karenge
 We have laid emphasis on infrastructure
 abhootpurv kharch infrastructure par die ja rahe hai
 The railway station should be modernized, in a small town, whether to build an airport, whether to arrange water-way, whether to arrange roadways, whether to build gas grid, whether to grid water, whether to do optical fiber network , We are giving full emphasis on all types of modern infrastructure
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, 21veen sadi main bharat ko aage badhaane kaa sabase urjavan kshetra he, hamaara purvi hindustan
 There is so much potential, powerful human resource, immense natural wealth, rich of hard work, and ability to change life by resolving
 hamaara puraa dhyaan purvi uttar pradesh, bihar, bengal, assam, north east, odisha, ye hamaare aise samarthyavan rajya hai, jahaan prakritik sampada bharpoor he, usko aage badhaakar ke desh ko ek nai oonchai par le jane kii disha main ham prayatnrat he
 Brothers and sisters, corruption-free India is a very important task, we are trying to strengthen it
 sarkaar banane ke baad pehla kaam kiya tha SIT banane kaa
 Today, after three years, i want to tell the countrymen, proudly tell them that within three years, we have discovered more than about 1
25 lakh crore rupees of black money, caught it and suurender it
 Is forced
 uske baad hamane notebandi kaa faisla kiya
 We have achieved many significant successes through demonetisation
 jo kalaadhan chipa hua tha, usko mukhyadhara main aana padaa
 You must have seen that we sometimes used to extend 07 days-10 days-15 days, sometimes at the petrol pump, sometimes at the drugstore, sometimes at the railway station, we continued to take old notes, because our effort was once Money should also become a part of the formal economy in the banks and we have successfully completed that work
 or iskaa kaaran yah hua he ki abhi jo research hua he, kareeb teen lakh karod rupye
 
 
 This government has not done research, outside experts have done it
 notebandi ke baad teen lakh karod rupye, jo atirikt, jo kabhi banking system main waapas nahin aata tha wo aayaa he
 More than a quarter of a million rupees in the amount deposited in banks is under suspicion
 kam se kam do lakh karod rupye se zyada kalaadhan usko bainko tak pahunchnaa padaa he or ab vyavastha ke saath unako apana jawaab dene ke liye majaboor hue hai
 The new black money has also come to a great halt
 is varsh, iskaa parinaam dekhie, 01 april se 05 agast tak income tax return daakhil karne vaale nae vyaktigat karadaataaon kii sankhya 56 lakh
 In the same period last year, this number was only 2
2 million
 Double se bhi zyada! ye kaaran kaledhan ke khilaaf hamaari ladaai kaa parinaam he
 More than 18 lakh people have been identified, whose income is more than the book according to them, they are uncountable and hence they have to answer this difference
 saadhe chaar lakh log isamen se ab maidan main aaye hai, apni galati sweekaar karke raste main aane kaa prayaas kar rahe hai
 One lakh people have come forward, who had never heard of income tax in life, nor had ever given income tax, nor had they thought of it, but today they have to do it
 bhaaiyon bahanon, hamaare desh main agar do chaar companiyaan bhi kahin band ho jaae, to choubison ghante us par charchaaen hoti hai us par Debates hoti hai
 Economy is over


 it is done, no matter what happens! You'd be surprised to know, black money traders, Shell used to run companies and after demonetisation when data-mining was done
 tab teen lakh aisi companiyaan pai gayi hai, jo sirf or sirf shell companiyaan hai
 Does hawala business
 teen lakh, koi kalpana kar saktaa he
 And we have canceled the registration of one and a half lakh from that
 paanch companiyaan band ho jaae to hindustan main tufaan much jaataa he
 Locked up to twenty two lakh companies
 desh kaa maal luutane waalon ko jawaab dena padegaa, ye kaam hamane kar ke dikhaaya
 You will be surprised! Some shell companies are such that four hundred and four hundred companies were running at the same address, brothers and sisters
 chaar sau chaar sau companiyaan chal rahi thim
 Nobody was going to see, nobody was going to ask
 sari mileebhagat chal rahi thi
 And so my brothers and sisters, i have waged a very big fight against corruption black money
 desh kii bhalaai ke liye desh ke garibon ke kalyaan ke liye, desh ke naujavaanon ke bhavishya ko banane ke liye
 Brothers and sisters, one step after the other, and i am sure it will increase further after GST
 or Transparency aane vaali he
 Transportation alone Our truck used to go from one place to another
 ye GST ke baad tees pratishat uskaa samay batch gaya he
 Thousands of crores of rupees have been saved due to the end of check-post
 sabase badi bachat samay kii hui he
 In a way, its thirty percent efficiency is increasing
 aap kalpana kar sakate hai hindustan ke Transport jagat main tees pratishat Efficiency badhane kaa matlab kya hota he
 a GST has brought about such a big change
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, aaj notebandi ke kaaran bainko ke paas dhan aayaa he
 Banks are reducing their interest rate
 mudra ke dwaara saamaanya maanav ko bank se paisa mil rahaa he
 The common man is getting an opportunity to stand on his feet
 garib ho, madhyavarg kaa vyakti ho ghar bananaa chahta he, to bank usko madad karne ke liye aage aa rahe hai, kam byaaj kii dar se aage aa rahe hai
 It is working towards accelerating the economy of the country
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, ab ye vakt badal chukaa he
 We are in the 21st century
 vishwa kaa sabase bada yuva varg hamaare desh main he
 Our identity in the world is by IT, by Digital World
 kya ab bhi ham usee pooraani soch main rahenge
 Hey! Once upon a time, leather coins used to move, slowly disappeared, no one was asking
 aaj jo kaagaj ke note hai, samay aate rahete wo sara kaa sara Digital Currency main Convert hone vaala he
 Let us lead, let us take responsibility, let us go towards Digital Transaction
 ham BHIM APP ko apanaaen, aarthik kaarobaar kaa hissaa banaaen
 We also work through Prepaid
 or mujhe khushi he ki Digital lenden badi he
 It has increased by 34 percent over the previous year and about 44 percent in prepaid payments
 or isaliye kam cash vaali arthvyavastha, usko lekar ke hamen aage badhanaa chahie
 My dear countrymen, there are some schemes of the government that can save money in the pockets of the common man of India
 agar aap LED Bulb lagaate hai, to saal bhar kaa hajaar do hajaar paanch hajaar rupaya aapkaa bachane vaala he
 If you succeed in a clean India, then the poor's medicine of seven thousand rupees stops
 mahangaai par niyantran, aapke badhate hue kharch ko rokane main safal hua he, ek prakaar se aapaki bachat he
 Affordable medicine shops have become a huge blessing for the poor through 'jan Aushadhi Kendras'
 hamaare yahaan Operation ke peeche, stent ke peeche jo kharch hote the wo kam hue hai
 In the coming days, all facilities will also be available for Knee's operation
 hamaari koshish he ki garib or madhyamvarg ke maanav ke liye ye kharch kam ho or uske liye ham ek ke baad ek kadam uthaa rahe hai
 Earlier, dialysis used to take place in the headquarters of the states in our country
 hamane tay kiya hindustan ke jila kendron tak Dialysis pahunchaayenge
 Nearly three and a half hundred and four hundred districts have been reached and by dialysis for free, we are working to save the life of the poor
 aaj desh garv kar saktaa he ki hamane vishwa ke saamne apni vyavasthaaon ko viksit kiya he
 Today we have succeeded in arranging NAVIC Navigation through GPS System
 hamane SAARC Satellite ke dwaara hamane padosi deshon ke saath madad karne kaa safal abhiyaan kiya he
 We are delivering our importance inside the world today by 'tejas' airplane
 ‘BHIM-AADHAR App’ duniya ke andar Digital Transaction ke liye ek ajooba bana hua he
 rupay Card
 
 
 hindustan main rupay Card karodon kii taadaad main he
 And if it becomes operational, if it is in the pocket of the poor, then it will become the largest in the world
 or isaliye mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, meraa aapse yahi aagrah he ki ham ‘new India’ kaa sankalp le kar ke aage badhen, samay rahete hue karen
 It is said in our scriptures: Aniyat Kaal: Aniyat Kaal: Prabhutyo Viplavante, Prabhutayo Viplavante
 sahi samay par agar koi kaary puraa nahin kiya gaya, to phir icchit parinaam kabhi nahin milte hai
 And so for 'team India', for Team India of 1
25 billion countrymen, today we have to pledge to make 'new India' by 2022 and we will do this work ourselves, no one will do it, we will do it ourselves
 desh ke liye karenge, pehle se acha karenge, pehle se zyada karenge, samarpan bhav se karenge, 2022 main ‘bhavy-divya’ hindustan dekhne ke liye karenge
 And that's why we will all together create an India where the poor have a pucca house, electricity, water
 ham sab milakar ek aisa bharat banaaenge, jahaan desh kaa kisaan chintaa main nahin chaiyn se soyega
 By 2022, he will earn twice as much as he is earning today
 ham sab milakar ke ek aisa hindustan banaaenge, jahaan yuvaaon, mahilaon ko apane sapane puure karne ke liye bharpoor avasar uplabdh honge
 Together we will create an India that will be free from terrorism, communalism and casteism
 ham sab milakar ke ek aisa bharat banaaenge, jahaan bhrashtachar or bhai-bhatijawad se koi samjhauta nahin hoga
 Together we will create an India that will be clean, healthy and fulfill the dream of Swaraj
 or isaliye mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, ham sab milakar ke vikaas kii is daud main aage chalane kaa prayaas karenge
 Today, after 70 years of independence, in the midst of waiting for 75 years of independence, in the important tenure of five years, all of us countrymen should go with the dream of a 'divine-grand India', with this same sentiment i once again i bow to the crazy people
 sava sau karod deshavaasiyon ke nae vishwaas, nai umang ko naman karata hum
 And call upon 'team India' to move forward with a new resolution
 isi bhaavana ke saath aap sabko hriday se meri bahut bahut shubhakamanaayen
 Bharat Mata Ki Jai, Vande Mataram Jai Hind
 jai hind, jai hind, jai hind, jai hind
 Bharat Mata Ki Jai, Bharat Mata Ki Jai, Bharat Mata Ki Jai
 vande maataram, vande maataram, vande maataram, vande maataram
 The comments sabhi kaa bahut bahut dhanyavad
 Sincerely: PIB bhaiyon-bahanon, sarkari kii yojanaon main raftaar badi he
 When the government is delayed in some work, it is not just the project delay
 wo sirf dhan ke kharchen se judaa hua vishay nahin hota he
 When any work gets stuck, stops, then my poor families suffer the most
 mere bhaiyo-bahanon ko hota he
 We can reach Mangalyaan within nine months
 yah hamaara samarthy he
 Mangalyaan can be reached from here within nine months
 lekin maine ek baar sarkaar ke kaam kaa lekha-jokha har maheene letaa rahata hum
 Once such a thing came to my attention, a 42-year-old project, a 70-72 km project, stuck on the rail for 42 years, was hanging
 bhaiyon-bahanon nau maheene main mangalayan pahunchane kaa samarthy rakhane vaala meraa desh 42 saal tak 70-72 kilometre ek rail kii patari na bicha sake, tab garib ke man main sawaal uthta he ki mere desh kaa kya hoga? or aisi chizon par hamane dhyaan diya he
 To change these things, we have tried to bring changes in them by adding all these things, be it the subject of new technology, geo-technology, space-technology
 aapane dekha hoga ek samay tha jab uria ke liye rajya or centre main tanaav chalata tha
 For kerosene, the state and center were tense
 ek aisa maahaul tha, jaise centre bada bhai, rajya chota bhai he
 The direction we worked from day one, because i have been the Chief Minister for a long time, so i know how important states are in the development of the country
 mukhyamantriyon kaa kitna mahatv he, rajyon kii sarkaron kaa kitna mahatv he, isko main bhalee-bhaanti samajhataa hum or isliye Co-operative Federalism or ab Competitive Co-operative Federalism us par hamane bal diya he or aapane dekha hoga ki aaj mil karke saare nirnay, ham mil karke kar rahe hai
 You will remember that from the ramparts of this Red Fort, once the Prime Minister discussed the plight of the power companies of the states of the country
 laal kile par se chintaa vyakt kerani padi thi
 Today, by taking the states together with the 'uday Yojana', by giving strength to the states, these problems were there in the business of the power factories, working together to solve it, this is a great proof of Federalism
 GST ke saath-saath chaahe Smart City ke nirmaan kii baat ho, chaahe swatchta kaa abhiyaan ho, chaahe toilet kii charchaa ho, Ease of doing Business kii baat ho, yah saare vishay aise hai ki hamaare desh ke sabhi rajya kandhe se kandhaa mila karke aaj bharat ke saath bharat kii sarkaar, kandhe se kandhaa mila karke rajya ke saath chalane main bahut safal ho rahi he
 My dear countrymen 'new India' is our greatest strength, democracy
 lekin ham jaanate hai ki hamane loktantr ko mat-patr tak simit kar diya he
 Democracy cannot be limited to ballot papers
 or isliye ham ‘new India’ main us loktantr par bal dena chaahate hai jisamen tantra se lok nahin, lekin logon se tantra chale, aisa loktantr ‘new India’ kii pahchaan bane, us disha main ham janaa chaahate hai
 Lokmanya Tilak ji had said, 'swarajya is my birth right'
 aaazaad bharat me ham sabakaa mantra hona chahie, ‘surajya meraa janmasiddh adhikaar he’
 'state' should be the responsibility of all of us
 naagarik ko apni jimmedaariyaan nibhaani chahie, sarkaron ne apni jimmedaariyaan nibhaani chahie
 When we have to walk from 'swarajya to Surajya', the countrymen do not stay back
 jab maine gas sabsidi chhodane ke liye kaha, desh aage aayaa
 Speaking of cleanliness, even today, in every corner of India, some one is carrying forward the cleanliness drive
 jab notebandi kii baat ai, duniya ko aashcharya hua tha, yahaan tak log kah rahe the, ab modi gaya
 But the patience of the 125 crore countrymen who showed in demonetisation, the faith that they told and the result of that, today we are succeeding in taking steps against corruption
 hamaare desh ke liye is nai lokbhagidaari kii parampara
 
 
 It is our effort to advance the country by public participation
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, laal bahadur shastri ne jai jawan jai kisaan kaa mantra diya tha
 The farmer of our country has never looked back, our farmer is giving record crop production today
 prakritik aapadaaon ke bich main nai–nai siddhiyaan wo hasil kar rahaa he
 There has been a record production of pulses and my dear brothers and sisters, my farmer brothers and sisters, there has never been a tradition of buying pulses in government in India and once in a while, according to thousands of tons It used to be, this time when the farmers of my country produced pulses and served nutritious food to the poor, the government increased this work by doing the historic work of buying 16 lakh tons of pulses Have received
 pradhanmantri fasal beemaa yojana, ek suraksha kavach mere kisaan bhaiyon ko mila he
 Three years ago, only 1
25 crore farmers used to take advantage of this Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, which was earlier known by another name
 aaj pradhanmantri fasal beemaa yojana main itane kam samay main kai naye kisaan iske saath jud gaye hai or kareeb-kareeb ye sankhya aage chalakar ke paune chah karod par pahunchi he
 The Prime Minister Agricultural Irrigation Scheme, if the farmer gets water, has the power to produce gold from the soil and so to provide water to the farmer last time i told the Red Fort, we have completed 21 of those schemes and the rest 50 plans will be completed in the coming time
 or total 99 yojanaon kaa maine sankalp liya he
 We will complete the water supply to the farmer's farm by completing those 99 big plans before 2019
 or kisaan ko beej se bazaar tak, jab tak ham vyastha nahin dete hai, hamaare kisaan ke bhagya ko ham nahin badal sakate hai
 And therefore it needs infrastructure, it needs supply-chain
 har saal lakhon-karodon rupayon kii hamaari sabji, hamaare fal, hamaari fasal barbaad ho jaati he or isliye usko badalane ke liye ek to Foreign Direct Investment ko badhaava diya taaki food processing ke andar duniya hamaare saath jude
 Promoted to create infrastructure and Government of India has implemented 'pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojana'
 jiske kaaran un vyavasthaaon kaa nirmaan kiya jayega jo beej se bazaar tak kisaan ko hand-holding karenge, vyavasthaaen viksit karenge or hamaare karodon kisaanon kii jindagi main ek nayaa badlaav laane main ham safal honge
 Due to Demand and Technology, the nature of job is also changing in our country
 rojgaar se judi yojanaon main, training ke tareeke main 21veen sadi kii aavashyaktaaon ke anusaar, maanav sansaadhan ke vikaas ke liye bharat sarkaar ne anek nai yojanaayen haath main lee hai
 a huge campaign has been launched to ensure that the youth get money from banks without guarantee
 hamaara noujvaan apane pairon par khadaa ho, wo rojgaar paane vaala rahe, rojgaar dene vaala bane, or pichley teen saal main dekha he ki ‘pradhanmantri mudra yojana’ ke kaaran karodon noujvaan apane pairon par khadey hue hai
 Not only this, a young man is also employing one or two to three more people
 shiksha ke kshetra main World Class Universities banane ke liye hamane bandhanon se mukti dene kaa ek bada ahm kadam uthaaya he
 20 Universities have been called upon to decide their fate, Government will not come anywhere
 upar se sarkaar 1000 karod rupee tak kii madad karne ke liye bhi taiyaar he
 Has given a call, i am sure the educational institutions of my country will definitely come forward and make it successful
 pichley teen varsh main 6 IIT, 7 nae IIM, 8 nae IIIT, iskaa nirmaan kiya he or shiksha ko naukari ke avasaron ke saath jodne kaa bhi is ko kaam hamane kiya he
 My mothers, sisters, today, in large quantities, women in the family also go for employment
 or isliye raatri ko bhi unako rojgaar kaa avasar mili, factoriyon main kaam karne kaa avasar mili, isliye Labour Laws main parivartan karne kaa bahut bada ahm kadam uthaaya he
 Our mothers and sisters are also an important unit of the family
 hamaara bhavishya nirmaan karne ke liye hamaari maataaon, bahanon kaa yogadan bahut bada hota he, or isliye Maternity Leave jo 12 saptaah kii thi, wo 26 saptaah, usamen aay chaalu rahegi, is prakaar se dene kaa kaam kiya he
 With regard to the work of empowerment of our women today, in particular, i would like to congratulate the sisters who have been forced to live a very difficult life due to triple talaq
 koi aashray nahin bachaa he, or aisi peedit, teen-talaak se peedit bahanon ne puure desh main ek andolan khadaa kiya he
 The intellectual class of the country was shaken, the media of the country also helped them, an atmosphere was created against triple talaq in the whole country
 is andolan ko chalaane vaali un meri bahanon ko, jo teen-talaak ke khilaaf ladai lard rahi hai, main hriday se unka abhindann karata hum or mujhe vishwaas he, ki maataaon-bahanon ko adhikaar dilaane main, unki is ladaai main hindustan unki puri madad karegaa
 Hindustan will help and it will be successful in this important step of Women Empowerment; i am sure of this
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyo, kabhi-kabhi aasthaa ke naam par dhairya ke abhaav main kuch log aisi chijen kar baithte hai, jo samaaj ke taane-bane ko bikher detii hai
 The country operates with peace, goodwill and unity
 jatvaad kaa jehar, sampradayawad kaa jehar, desh kaa kabhi bhala nahin kar saktaa he
 This is Gandhi's land, Buddha's land, take everyone along and walk; It is part of the culture and tradition of this country
 hamen isko safalataa se aage badhanaa he, or isliye aasthaa ke naam par hinsa ko bal nahin diya ja saktaa he
 If something happens to the patient in the hospital, the hospital is burnt; Accidentally, carts should be burnt; Move, government property be burned; Whose is this for Azad Hindustan? We have assets of 1
25 billion countrymen
 ye saanskrithik viraasat kiski he? ye ham sava sau karod deshavaasiyon kii saanskrithik viraasat he
 Whose faith is this? We are the faith of 125 crore countrymen; And so the path of violence in the name of faith can never go on in this country, this country can never accept
 or isliye main deshavaasiyon se aagrah karuunga, us samay ‘bharat chodo’ kaa naaraa tha, aaj naaraa he ‘bharat jodo’
 We have to take person-to-person, take people-to-people, we have to take every section of the society together, and we have to take the country forward by taking the same
 samrudh bharat banane ke liye hamaari majboot arthvyavastha chahie
 We need balanced development, next generation infrastructure, then we can see the India of our dreams in front of our eyes
 bhaaiyo-bahanon, anginat nirnay hamane teen saal main liye
 Some things have been noted and some things may not have come into notice
 lekin ek baat mahatvapurn he
 When you make such a big change, the stops come, the speed stops
 lekin is sarkaar kii kaaryastylee dekhie, agar train bhi kisi railway stesan ke paas se guzarati he, jab trek badalati he to 60 se chalane vaali speed ko usko 30 kii speed main laana padataa he
 The speed of the train decreases by changing the track
 ham puure desh ko ek nae trek par le jane kaa prayaas kar rahe hai, lekin hamane uski speed kam nahin hone di he, hamane uski gati ko barkaraar rakhaa he
 Whether we bring GST, any law, any new system, we have succeeded in doing that and we will do it in future
 hamane infrastructure par bal diya he
 Unprecedented expenses are being given on infrastructure
 railway stesan kaa aadhunikeekaran ho, chote shahar main, chaahe airport bananaa ho, chaahe water-way kii vyavastha kerani ho, chaahe roadways kii vyavastha kerani ho, chaahe gas grid banani ho, chaahe pani kii grid karaani ho, chaahe optical fibre network karnaa ho, har prakaar ke aadhunik infrastructure par ham purna bal de rahe hai
 My dear countrymen, our eastern India is the most energetic field to advance India in the 21st century
 itnaa potential he, samarthyavan maanav sansaadhan he, apaar prakritik sampada he, parishram ke dhani hai, sankalp karke jindagi badalane kaa samarthy rakhte hai
 Our entire focus is on eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Bengal, Assam, North East, Odisha, these are our powerful states, where natural wealth is abundant, we are trying to take the country to a new height by taking it forward
 bhaaiyo-bahanon, bhrashtachar mukt bharat ek bada ahm kaam he, usko ham bal dene kaa prayaas kar rahe he
 After the formation of the government, the first task was to create SIT
 aaj teen saal ke baad main deshavaasiyon ko bataanaa chahta hum, garv se bataanaa chahta hum ki teen saal ke bheetar-bheetar, kareeb-kareeb sava lakh karod rupye se bhi zyada kalaadhan ko hamane khoj diya he, usko pakadaa he or usko suurender karne ke liye majaboor kiya he
 After that we decided to demonetise
 notebandi ke dwaara hamane anek mahatvapurn safaltaaen praapt kii hai
 The black money that was hidden had to come into the mainstream
 aapane dekha hoga ki ham kabhi 07 din-10 din-15 din badhaate jate the, kabhi petrol pump par, kabhi dawaai kii dukaan par, kabhi railway stesan par puraane note lene kaa silsilaa jari rakhte the, kyonki hamaara prayaas tha ki ek baar jo bhi dhan aae wo bainkon main formal economy kaa hissaa ban jaae or us kaam ko hamane safaltaapurvak paar kiya he
 And the reason for this is that the research that has been done now, is about three lakh crore rupees
 
 
 ye sarkaar ne research nahin kii he, baahar ke expert ne kii he
 Three lakh crore rupees after demonetisation, the additional, which never came back in the banking system, has come
 bainkon main jamaa kii gai raashi main paune do lakh karod se adhik raashi shaq ke ghere main he
 At least two lakh crore rupees of black money has had to reach the banks and now they are forced to give their answers with the system
 nae kaledhan par bhi bahut badi rukaawat aa gai he
 This year, see the result, 56 lakh new taxpayers filing income tax returns from 01 April to 05 August
 pichley saal usee avadhi main ye sankhya sirf 22 lakh thi
 More than double! These reasons are the result of our fight against black money
 18 lakh se zyada aise logon ko pahchaan liya gaya he, jinaki aay unke hisaab kitaab se kuch zyada he, beshumaar zyada he or isaliye is antar kaa unako jawaab dena pad rahaa he
 Out of this, four and a half lakh people have now come to the field, accepting their mistake and trying to get in the way
 ek lakh log aise saamne aae hai, jinhone kabhi jindagi main Income Tax kaa naam bhi nahin suna tha, na Income Tax kabhi diya tha, na kabhi unhone us par sochaa tha, lekin aaj unako wo karnaa pad rahaa he
 Brothers and sisters, if two or four companies are shut down in our country, then there are discussions on them round the clock
 arthniti khatm ho gai


 ye ho gaya, na jane kya kya hota he! aapako jaanakar ke hairaani hogi, kaale dhan ke kaarobaari, Shell companiyaan chalaate the or notebandi ke baad jab data-mining kiya gaya
 Then three lakh such companies have been found, which are just and shell companies only
 hawala kaa kaarobaar karti hai
 Three lakhs, one can imagine
 or usamen se paune do lakh kaa registration hamanen Cancel kar diya he
 If five companies are closed, then there is a storm in India
 paune do lakh companiyon ko taale laga diye
 Those who looted the goods of the country will have to answer, we did this by doing this
 aapako hairaani hogi! kuch to shell companiyaan aisi hai, jo ek hi Address par chaar sau chaar sau companiyaan chal rahi thim, bhaaiyon bahanon
 Four hundred and four hundred companies were operating
 koi dekhne vaala nahin tha, koi poochne vaala nahin tha
 All the collusion was going on
 or isaliye mere bhaaiyon bahanon, maine bhrashtachar kaale dhan ke khilaaf ek bahut badi ladaai chhedi he
 For the betterment of the country, for the welfare of the poor of the country, for the future of the youth of the country
 bhaaiyon bahanon, ek ke baad ek kadam or mujhe vishwaas he GST ke baad usamen or badhotaree hone vaali he

 My dear countrymen, today money has come to banks due to demonetisation

 mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, sarkaar kii kuch yojanaayen aisi hai, jo hindustan ke saamaanya maanav kii jeb main paise bachaa saken
 If you put an LED bulb, then a thousand rupees two thousand five thousand rupees of the year are going to save you
 agar aap svachh bharat main safal hote hai, to garib kaa saat hajaar kaa rupaya dawaai kaa band hota he
 Controlling inflation has been successful in curbing your rising expenses, in a way your savings
 ‘jan aushadhi kendron’ ke dwaara sasti dawaai kii dukaan garib ke liye ek bahut bada aashirwad bani he
 The expenses that were behind our operation, behind the stent, have come down
 aane vaale dinon main Knee ke Operation ke liye bhi sari suvidhaayen milengi
 Our effort is to reduce these expenses for the poor and middle class human beings and for that we are taking steps one after the other
 pehle hamaare desh main rajyon ke mukhyalay main Dialysis hua karata tha
 We decided to deliver dialysis to the district centers of India
 kareeb saadhe teen sau, chaar sau jilon tak pahunchaa diya or muft main Dialysis karke garib kii jindagi bachaane kaa kaam ham kar rahe hai
 Today the country can be proud that we have developed our systems in front of the world

 Through SAARC Satellite, we have successfully campaigned to help with neighboring countries
 ham ‘tejas’ hawaii jahaaj ke dwaara aaj duniya ke andar apni ahmiyat pahunchaa rahe hai
 The 'BHIM-AADHAR App' is a wonder within the world for Digital Transaction
 rupay Card 
 
 
 In India, rupay Card is worth crores
 or agar wo operational ho jayega, wo agar garibon ke jeb main he, to duniya kaa, ye sabase bada ho jayega
 And that's why my dear countrymen, i request you to move ahead by taking a pledge for 'new India', and do it in time
 hamaare yahaan shastron main kaha gaya haih aniyat kaal:, aniyat kaalah prabhutayo viplavante, prabhutayo viplavante
 If a task is not completed at the right time, then the desired result is never achieved

 And therefore my dear countrymen, we will all try to work together in this race of development

 tippaniyan Thank you very much to all
 saabhaar: PIB You must have seen a time when there was tension in the state and center for urea
 kerosene ke liye rajya or centre ke liye tanaav chalata tha
 There was an atmosphere like the center is the elder brother, the state is the younger brother
 hamane pehle din se jis disha main kaam kiya, kyonki lambe arase se mukhyamantri rahaa hum, isliye mujhe pataa he ki desh ke vikaas main rajyon kii kitni ahmiyat he
 i understand the importance of the Chief Ministers, how important the Governments of the States are, and therefore Co-operative Federalism and now Competitive Co-operative Federalism we have emphasized that and you must have seen that today all the decisions together , We are doing it together
 aapako yaad hoga isi lalakile kii pracheer se ek baar desh ke rajyo kii bijli companiyon kii durdasha kii charchaa ek pradhanmantri ne kii thi
 Had to worry about the Red Fort
 aaj hamane rajyon ko saath le kar ke ‘udai yojana’ ke dwaara rajyon ko takat de karke us bijli ke kaarkaanon ke kaarobaar main yah samasyaayein thi, uskaa samaadhaan kaa kaam mil karke kiya, yah Federalism kaa ek bahut bada saboot he
 Along with the GST, whether it is about the construction of Smart City, whether it is a campaign for cleanliness, whether it is a discussion of toilet, ease of doing business, all these subjects are such that all the states of our country join shoulder to shoulder
 Today, the Government of India is being very successful in running shoulder to shoulder with the state
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyon ‘new India’ hamaari sabase badi takat he, loktantr he
 But we know that we have limited democracy to the ballot paper
 loktantr mat-patr tak simit nahin ho saktaa
 And that is why we want to emphasize on democracy in 'new India' in which the system is not public, but the people should have the system, so that democracy should become the identity of 'new India', we want to go in that direction
 lokmaanya tilak ji ne kaha tha, ‘swarajya meraa janmasiddh adhikaar he’
 The mantra of all of us in independent India should be, 'state is my rightful birth'
 ‘surajya’ ham sabakaa daayitv hona chahie
 Citizens should carry out their responsibilities, governments should fulfill their responsibilities
 ‘swarajya se surajya’ kii ore jab chalanaa he, to deshvasi peeche nahin rahete
 When i asked to give up the gas subsidy, the country came forward
 swatchta kii baat kahi, aaj bhi hindustan ke har kone main koi na koi swatchta ke abhiyaan ko aage badha rahaa he
 When it came to demonetisation, the world was surprised, even people were saying, now Modi has gone
 lekin notebandi main sava sau karod deshavaasiyon ne jis dhairya ko dikhaaya, jis vishwaas ko bataaya or usee kaa parinaam he ki aaj bhrashtachar ke khilaaf nakel lagane main ham ek ke baad kadam uthaane main safal ho rahe hai
 This new tradition of public participation for our country
 
 
 janabhagidaari se hi desh ko aage badhaane main hamaara prayaas he
 My dear countrymen, Lal Bahadur Shastri gave the mantra of Jai Jawan Jai Kisan
 hamaare desh ke kisaan ne peeche mud ke kabhi dekha nahin, record fasal utpaadan aaj hamaara kisaan karke de rahaa he
 In the midst of natural disasters, he is getting new achievements
 daal kaa record utpaadan hua he or mere pyaare bhaiyo bahanon, mere kisaan bhaiyo bahanon, hindustan main kabhi bhi sarkaar main daal kharidne kii parampara hi nahin rahi he or kabhi ek-aadh baar kiya ho to hajaaron main hi hajaaron ton ke hisaab ke hisaab se hota tha, is baar jab mere desh ke kisaanon ne daal utpaadan karke garib ko paushtik aahaar dene kaa kaam kiya, to 16 lakh ton daal, sarkaar ne kharidne kaa aitihaasik kaam karke is kaam ko badhaava diya
 Prime Minister Crop Insurance Scheme, a security shield has been provided to my farmer brothers
 teen saal pehle sirf sava teen karod kisaan is pradhanmantri fasal beemaa yojana, jo pehle duusare naam se chalati thi uskaa laabh lete the
 Today, in such a short time under the Prime Minister Crop Insurance Scheme, many new farmers have joined with it and almost these numbers have reached a further six crores
 pradhanmantri krishi sinchai yojana, kisaan ko agar pani mili to mitti main se sona paidaa karne kii takat rakhata he or isliye kisaan ko pani pahunchane ke liye maine pichhali baar lalakile se kaha tha, un yojaanaaon main se 21 yojana ham purna kar chuke hai or baaki 50 yojanaayen aane vaale kuch samay main purna ho jaaengi
 And i have resolved a total of 99 schemes
 2019 ke pehle un 99 badi-bady yojanaayen ko paripurna karke, kisaan ke khet tak pani pahunchane kaa kaam ham purna kar denge
 And we cannot change the fate of our farmer till we provide for the farmer from seed to market
 or isliye uske liye infrastructure chahie, uske liye supply-chain chahie
 Every year our vegetables, our fruits, our crops worth millions and billions are wasted and so to change that, one has encouraged Foreign Direct Investment so that the world can join us in food processing
 Infrastructure banane ke liye badhaava diya or bharat sarkaar ne ‘pradhanmantri kisaan sampada yojana’ lagu kii he
 Due to which arrangements will be made that will hand-hold the farmer from seed to market, develop systems and we will be successful in bringing a new change in the lives of our crores of farmers
 Demand or Technology ke kaaran, hamaare desh main nature of job main bhi bahut bada badlaav aa rahaa he
 In employment related schemes, according to the requirements of 21st century in the way of training, the Government of India has taken up many new schemes for the development of human resources
 naujavaanon ko bina guarantee bainkon se paisa mili iske liye bahut bada abhiyaan chalaaya he
 Our youth should stand on their feet, they should get employment, become employable, and in the last three years we have seen that due to 'pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana', crores of youth have stood on their feet
 itnaa hi nahin, ek noujvaan ek yaa do teen or logon ko bhi rojgaar de rahaa he
 To create World Class Universities in the field of education, we have taken a major step to break free from bondage
 20 uniwarsitiyon kaa aahvaan kiya he ki aap apane bhagya kaa faisla kiijie, sarkaar kahin bich main nahin aegi
 From above the government is also ready to help up to 1000 crores rupees
 aahvaan kiya he, mujhe vishwaas he mere desh kii shiksha sansthaaon main jarur aage aaenge, isko safal karenge
 In the last three years, 6 iits, 7 new iims, 8 new iiits have been built, and we have also done this work to link education with job opportunities
 meri maatayen, bahanen aaj bahut badi maatra main, parivaar main mahilaayein bhi rojgaar ke liye jaati hai
 And so at night, they get employment opportunities, work in factories, so have taken a very important step to change Labor Laws
 hamaari maatayen, bahanen parivaar kii bhi ek ahm ikai hai
 The contribution of our mothers and sisters is huge to build our future, and so Maternity Leave, which was 12 weeks, will continue to have income in 26 weeks, thus giving has worked
 main aaj hamaari mahilaon ke shashaktikaran ke kaam ke sambandh main, main khaas karke, main un bahanon kaa abhinandan karnaa chahta hum jo teen talaak ke kaaran bahut hi durdavy jindagi jeene ke liye majaboor hui hai
 There is no shelter left, and such afflicted, triple-divorced sisters have started a movement across the country
 desh ke buddhijivi varg ko hilaa diya, desh ke media ne bhi unki madad kii, puure desh main teen-talaak ke khilaaf ek maahaul nirmaan hua
 i heartily congratulate my sisters who are fighting this movement against the triple talaq, and i am sure that in helping them in their fight for the empowerment of mothers and sisters, Will do
 hindustan puri madad karegaa or Women Empowerment ke is mahatvapurn kadam main wo safal hoke rahegi; aisa mujhe puraa bharosa he
 My dear countrymen, sometimes in the name of faith, in the absence of patience some people do such things, which spoil the fabric of society
 desh shanti, sadbhaavna or ekta se chalata he
 The poison of casteism, the poison of communalism, can never benefit the country
 ye to gandhi kii bhoomi he, buddha kii bhoomi he, sabko saath le karke chalanaa; ye is desh kii samskruti or parampara kaa hissaa he
 We have to carry it forward successfully, and hence violence cannot be stressed in the name of faith
 aspataal main to patient ke saath kuch ho jaae, aspataal jala diya jaae; aksmaat ho jaae, gaadiyaan jala diya jaaen; andolan karen, sarkari sampatti ko jala diya jaae; aaazaad hindustan ke liye ye kiskaa he? hamaare sava sau karod deshavaasiyon kii sampatti he
 Whose cultural heritage is this? This is the cultural heritage of 1
25 billion countrymen
 ye aasthaa kiski he? ham sava sau karod deshavaasiyon kii aasthaa he; or isliye aasthaa ke naam par hinsa kaa rasta, is desh main kabhi bhi chal nahin saktaa, yah desh kabhi sweekaar nahin kar saktaa he
 And so i will urge the countrymen, at that time there was the slogan 'quit India', today the slogan is 'add India'
 vyakti-vyakti ko hamane saath lenaa he, jan-jan ko saath lenaa he, samaaj ke har tabake ko saath lenaa he, or usee ko le karke hamen desh ko aage badhanaa he
 We need a strong economy to build a prosperous India
 santulit vikaas chahie, next generation infrastructure chahie, tab ja kar ke hamaare sapanom ke bharat ko ham apni ankhon ke saamne dekh sakate hai
 Brothers and sisters, we have taken countless decisions in three years
 kuch chizon ko notice kiya gaya he or kuch chijen shaayad notice main nahin ai
 But one thing is important
 jab aap itnaa bada badlaav karte he to rukvaaten aati hai, gati ruk jaati he
 But see the working style of this government, if the train also passes near a railway station, when the track changes, the speed running from 60 has to be brought to the speed of 30
 trek badalane par train kii speed kam ho jaati he
 We are trying to take the whole country to a new track, but we have not let his speed down, we have kept his pace
 chaahe GST laaen ho, koi bhi kanoon laaen ho, koi bhi nai vyavastha laae ho, ham usko karne main safal hue he or aage bhi isko ham karenge
 We have laid emphasis on infrastructure
 abhootpurv kharch infrastructure par die ja rahe hai
 The railway station should be modernized, in a small town, whether to build an airport, whether to arrange water-way, whether to arrange roadways, whether to build gas grid, whether to grid water, whether to do optical fiber network , We are giving full emphasis on all types of modern infrastructure
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, 21veen sadi main bharat ko aage badhaane kaa sabase urjavan kshetra he, hamaara purvi hindustan
 There is so much potential, powerful human resource, immense natural wealth, rich of hard work, and ability to change life by resolving
 hamaara puraa dhyaan purvi uttar pradesh, bihar, bengal, assam, north east, odisha, ye hamaare aise samarthyavan rajya hai, jahaan prakritik sampada bharpoor he, usko aage badhaakar ke desh ko ek nai oonchai par le jane kii disha main ham prayatnrat he
 Brothers and sisters, corruption-free India is a very important task, we are trying to strengthen it
 sarkaar banane ke baad pehla kaam kiya tha SIT banane kaa
 Today, after three years, i want to tell the countrymen, proudly tell them that within three years, we have discovered more than about 1
25 lakh crore rupees of black money, caught it and suurender it
 Is forced
 uske baad hamane notebandi kaa faisla kiya
 We have achieved many significant successes through demonetisation
 jo kalaadhan chipa hua tha, usko mukhyadhara main aana padaa
 You must have seen that we sometimes used to extend 07 days-10 days-15 days, sometimes at the petrol pump, sometimes at the drugstore, sometimes at the railway station, we continued to take old notes, because our effort was once Money should also become a part of the formal economy in the banks and we have successfully completed that work
 or iskaa kaaran yah hua he ki abhi jo research hua he, kareeb teen lakh karod rupye
 
 
 This government has not done research, outside experts have done it
 notebandi ke baad teen lakh karod rupye, jo atirikt, jo kabhi banking system main waapas nahin aata tha wo aayaa he
 More than a quarter of a million rupees in the amount deposited in banks is under suspicion
 kam se kam do lakh karod rupye se zyada kalaadhan usko bainko tak pahunchnaa padaa he or ab vyavastha ke saath unako apana jawaab dene ke liye majaboor hue hai
 The new black money has also come to a great halt
 is varsh, iskaa parinaam dekhie, 01 april se 05 agast tak income tax return daakhil karne vaale nae vyaktigat karadaataaon kii sankhya 56 lakh
 In the same period last year, this number was only 2
2 million
 Double se bhi zyada! ye kaaran kaledhan ke khilaaf hamaari ladaai kaa parinaam he
 More than 18 lakh people have been identified, whose income is more than the book according to them, they are uncountable and hence they have to answer this difference
 saadhe chaar lakh log isamen se ab maidan main aaye hai, apni galati sweekaar karke raste main aane kaa prayaas kar rahe hai
 One lakh people have come forward, who had never heard of income tax in life, nor had ever given income tax, nor had they thought of it, but today they have to do it
 bhaaiyon bahanon, hamaare desh main agar do chaar companiyaan bhi kahin band ho jaae, to choubison ghante us par charchaaen hoti hai us par Debates hoti hai
 Economy is over


 it is done, no matter what happens! You'd be surprised to know, black money traders, Shell used to run companies and after demonetisation when data-mining was done
 tab teen lakh aisi companiyaan pai gayi hai, jo sirf or sirf shell companiyaan hai
 Does hawala business
 teen lakh, koi kalpana kar saktaa he
 And we have canceled the registration of one and a half lakh from that
 paanch companiyaan band ho jaae to hindustan main tufaan much jaataa he
 Locked up to twenty two lakh companies
 desh kaa maal luutane waalon ko jawaab dena padegaa, ye kaam hamane kar ke dikhaaya
 You will be surprised! Some shell companies are such that four hundred and four hundred companies were running at the same address, brothers and sisters
 chaar sau chaar sau companiyaan chal rahi thim
 Nobody was going to see, nobody was going to ask
 sari mileebhagat chal rahi thi
 And so my brothers and sisters, i have waged a very big fight against corruption black money
 desh kii bhalaai ke liye desh ke garibon ke kalyaan ke liye, desh ke naujavaanon ke bhavishya ko banane ke liye
 Brothers and sisters, one step after the other, and i am sure it will increase further after GST
 or Transparency aane vaali he
 Transportation alone Our truck used to go from one place to another
 ye GST ke baad tees pratishat uskaa samay batch gaya he
 Thousands of crores of rupees have been saved due to the end of check-post
 sabase badi bachat samay kii hui he
 In a way, its thirty percent efficiency is increasing
 aap kalpana kar sakate hai hindustan ke Transport jagat main tees pratishat Efficiency badhane kaa matlab kya hota he
 a GST has brought about such a big change
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, aaj notebandi ke kaaran bainko ke paas dhan aayaa he
 Banks are reducing their interest rate
 mudra ke dwaara saamaanya maanav ko bank se paisa mil rahaa he
 The common man is getting an opportunity to stand on his feet
 garib ho, madhyavarg kaa vyakti ho ghar bananaa chahta he, to bank usko madad karne ke liye aage aa rahe hai, kam byaaj kii dar se aage aa rahe hai
 It is working towards accelerating the economy of the country
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, ab ye vakt badal chukaa he
 We are in the 21st century
 vishwa kaa sabase bada yuva varg hamaare desh main he
 Our identity in the world is by IT, by Digital World
 kya ab bhi ham usee pooraani soch main rahenge
 Hey! Once upon a time, leather coins used to move, slowly disappeared, no one was asking
 aaj jo kaagaj ke note hai, samay aate rahete wo sara kaa sara Digital Currency main Convert hone vaala he
 Let us lead, let us take responsibility, let us go towards Digital Transaction
 ham BHIM APP ko apanaaen, aarthik kaarobaar kaa hissaa banaaen
 We also work through Prepaid
 or mujhe khushi he ki Digital lenden badi he
 It has increased by 34 percent over the previous year and about 44 percent in prepaid payments
 or isaliye kam cash vaali arthvyavastha, usko lekar ke hamen aage badhanaa chahie
 My dear countrymen, there are some schemes of the government that can save money in the pockets of the common man of India
 agar aap LED Bulb lagaate hai, to saal bhar kaa hajaar do hajaar paanch hajaar rupaya aapkaa bachane vaala he
 If you succeed in a clean India, then the poor's medicine of seven thousand rupees stops
 mahangaai par niyantran, aapke badhate hue kharch ko rokane main safal hua he, ek prakaar se aapaki bachat he
 Affordable medicine shops have become a huge blessing for the poor through 'jan Aushadhi Kendras'
 hamaare yahaan Operation ke peeche, stent ke peeche jo kharch hote the wo kam hue hai
 In the coming days, all facilities will also be available for Knee's operation
 hamaari koshish he ki garib or madhyamvarg ke maanav ke liye ye kharch kam ho or uske liye ham ek ke baad ek kadam uthaa rahe hai
 Earlier, dialysis used to take place in the headquarters of the states in our country
 hamane tay kiya hindustan ke jila kendron tak Dialysis pahunchaayenge
 Nearly three and a half hundred and four hundred districts have been reached and by dialysis for free, we are working to save the life of the poor
 aaj desh garv kar saktaa he ki hamane vishwa ke saamne apni vyavasthaaon ko viksit kiya he
 Today we have succeeded in arranging NAVIC Navigation through GPS System
 hamane SAARC Satellite ke dwaara hamane padosi deshon ke saath madad karne kaa safal abhiyaan kiya he
 We are delivering our importance inside the world today by 'tejas' airplane
 ‘BHIM-AADHAR App’ duniya ke andar Digital Transaction ke liye ek ajooba bana hua he
 rupay Card
 
 
 hindustan main rupay Card karodon kii taadaad main he
 And if it becomes operational, if it is in the pocket of the poor, then it will become the largest in the world
 or isaliye mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, meraa aapse yahi aagrah he ki ham ‘new India’ kaa sankalp le kar ke aage badhen, samay rahete hue karen
 It is said in our scriptures: Aniyat Kaal: Aniyat Kaal: Prabhutyo Viplavante, Prabhutayo Viplavante
 sahi samay par agar koi kaary puraa nahin kiya gaya, to phir icchit parinaam kabhi nahin milte hai
 And so for 'team India', for Team India of 1
25 billion countrymen, today we have to pledge to make 'new India' by 2022 and we will do this work ourselves, no one will do it, we will do it ourselves
 desh ke liye karenge, pehle se acha karenge, pehle se zyada karenge, samarpan bhav se karenge, 2022 main ‘bhavy-divya’ hindustan dekhne ke liye karenge
 And that's why we will all together create an India where the poor have a pucca house, electricity, water
 ham sab milakar ek aisa bharat banaaenge, jahaan desh kaa kisaan chintaa main nahin chaiyn se soyega
 By 2022, he will earn twice as much as he is earning today
 ham sab milakar ke ek aisa hindustan banaaenge, jahaan yuvaaon, mahilaon ko apane sapane puure karne ke liye bharpoor avasar uplabdh honge
 Together we will create an India that will be free from terrorism, communalism and casteism
 ham sab milakar ke ek aisa bharat banaaenge, jahaan bhrashtachar or bhai-bhatijawad se koi samjhauta nahin hoga
 Together we will create an India that will be clean, healthy and fulfill the dream of Swaraj
 or isaliye mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, ham sab milakar ke vikaas kii is daud main aage chalane kaa prayaas karenge
 Today, after 70 years of independence, in the midst of waiting for 75 years of independence, in the important tenure of five years, all of us countrymen should go with the dream of a 'divine-grand India', with this same sentiment i once again i bow to the crazy people
 sava sau karod deshavaasiyon ke nae vishwaas, nai umang ko naman karata hum
 And call upon 'team India' to move forward with a new resolution

 Sincerely: PIB aapako yaad hoga isi lalakile kii pracheer se ek baar desh ke rajyo kii bijli companiyon kii durdasha kii charchaa ek pradhanmantri ne kii thi
 Had to worry about the Red Fort
 aaj hamane rajyon ko saath le kar ke ‘udai yojana’ ke dwaara rajyon ko takat de karke us bijli ke kaarkaanon ke kaarobaar main yah samasyaayein thi, uskaa samaadhaan kaa kaam mil karke kiya, yah Federalism kaa ek bahut bada saboot he

 janabhagidaari se hi desh ko aage badhaane main hamaara prayaas he
 My dear countrymen, Lal Bahadur Shastri gave the mantra of Jai Jawan Jai Kisan
 hamaare desh ke kisaan ne peeche mud ke kabhi dekha nahin, record fasal utpaadan aaj hamaara kisaan karke de rahaa he
 In the midst of natural disasters, he is getting new achievements
 daal kaa record utpaadan hua he or mere pyaare bhaiyo bahanon, mere kisaan bhaiyo bahanon, hindustan main kabhi bhi sarkaar main daal kharidne kii parampara hi nahin rahi he or kabhi ek-aadh baar kiya ho to hajaaron main hi hajaaron ton ke hisaab ke hisaab se hota tha, is baar jab mere desh ke kisaanon ne daal utpaadan karke garib ko paushtik aahaar dene kaa kaam kiya, to 16 lakh ton daal, sarkaar ne kharidne kaa aitihaasik kaam karke is kaam ko badhaava diya
 Prime Minister Crop Insurance Scheme, a security shield has been provided to my farmer brothers
 teen saal pehle sirf sava teen karod kisaan is pradhanmantri fasal beemaa yojana, jo pehle duusare naam se chalati thi uskaa laabh lete the
 Today, in such a short time under the Prime Minister Crop Insurance Scheme, many new farmers have joined with it and almost these numbers have reached a further six crores
 pradhanmantri krishi sinchai yojana, kisaan ko agar pani mili to mitti main se sona paidaa karne kii takat rakhata he or isliye kisaan ko pani pahunchane ke liye maine pichhali baar lalakile se kaha tha, un yojaanaaon main se 21 yojana ham purna kar chuke hai or baaki 50 yojanaayen aane vaale kuch samay main purna ho jaaengi
 And i have resolved a total of 99 schemes
 2019 ke pehle un 99 badi-bady yojanaayen ko paripurna karke, kisaan ke khet tak pani pahunchane kaa kaam ham purna kar denge
 And we cannot change the fate of our farmer till we provide for the farmer from seed to market
 or isliye uske liye infrastructure chahie, uske liye supply-chain chahie
 Every year our vegetables, our fruits, our crops worth millions and billions are wasted and so to change that, one has encouraged Foreign Direct Investment so that the world can join us in food processing
 Infrastructure banane ke liye badhaava diya or bharat sarkaar ne ‘pradhanmantri kisaan sampada yojana’ lagu kii he
 Due to which arrangements will be made that will hand-hold the farmer from seed to market, develop systems and we will be successful in bringing a new change in the lives of our crores of farmers
 Demand or Technology ke kaaran, hamaare desh main nature of job main bhi bahut bada badlaav aa rahaa he
 In employment related schemes, according to the requirements of 21st century in the way of training, the Government of India has taken up many new schemes for the development of human resources
 naujavaanon ko bina guarantee bainkon se paisa mili iske liye bahut bada abhiyaan chalaaya he
 Our youth should stand on their feet, they should get employment, become employable, and in the last three years we have seen that due to 'pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana', crores of youth have stood on their feet
 itnaa hi nahin, ek noujvaan ek yaa do teen or logon ko bhi rojgaar de rahaa he
 To create World Class Universities in the field of education, we have taken a major step to break free from bondage
 20 uniwarsitiyon kaa aahvaan kiya he ki aap apane bhagya kaa faisla kiijie, sarkaar kahin bich main nahin aegi
 From above the government is also ready to help up to 1000 crores rupees
 aahvaan kiya he, mujhe vishwaas he mere desh kii shiksha sansthaaon main jarur aage aaenge, isko safal karenge
 In the last three years, 6 iits, 7 new iims, 8 new iiits have been built, and we have also done this work to link education with job opportunities
 meri maatayen, bahanen aaj bahut badi maatra main, parivaar main mahilaayein bhi rojgaar ke liye jaati hai
 And so at night, they get employment opportunities, work in factories, so have taken a very important step to change Labor Laws
 hamaari maatayen, bahanen parivaar kii bhi ek ahm ikai hai
 The contribution of our mothers and sisters is huge to build our future, and so Maternity Leave, which was 12 weeks, will continue to have income in 26 weeks, thus giving has worked
 main aaj hamaari mahilaon ke shashaktikaran ke kaam ke sambandh main, main khaas karke, main un bahanon kaa abhinandan karnaa chahta hum jo teen talaak ke kaaran bahut hi durdavy jindagi jeene ke liye majaboor hui hai
 There is no shelter left, and such afflicted, triple-divorced sisters have started a movement across the country
 desh ke buddhijivi varg ko hilaa diya, desh ke media ne bhi unki madad kii, puure desh main teen-talaak ke khilaaf ek maahaul nirmaan hua
 i heartily congratulate my sisters who are fighting this movement against the triple talaq, and i am sure that in helping them in their fight for the empowerment of mothers and sisters, Will do
 hindustan puri madad karegaa or Women Empowerment ke is mahatvapurn kadam main wo safal hoke rahegi; aisa mujhe puraa bharosa he
 My dear countrymen, sometimes in the name of faith, in the absence of patience some people do such things, which spoil the fabric of society
 desh shanti, sadbhaavna or ekta se chalata he
 The poison of casteism, the poison of communalism, can never benefit the country
 ye to gandhi kii bhoomi he, buddha kii bhoomi he, sabko saath le karke chalanaa; ye is desh kii samskruti or parampara kaa hissaa he
 We have to carry it forward successfully, and hence violence cannot be stressed in the name of faith
 aspataal main to patient ke saath kuch ho jaae, aspataal jala diya jaae; aksmaat ho jaae, gaadiyaan jala diya jaaen; andolan karen, sarkari sampatti ko jala diya jaae; aaazaad hindustan ke liye ye kiskaa he? hamaare sava sau karod deshavaasiyon kii sampatti he
 Whose cultural heritage is this? This is the cultural heritage of 1
25 billion countrymen
 ye aasthaa kiski he? ham sava sau karod deshavaasiyon kii aasthaa he; or isliye aasthaa ke naam par hinsa kaa rasta, is desh main kabhi bhi chal nahin saktaa, yah desh kabhi sweekaar nahin kar saktaa he
 And so i will urge the countrymen, at that time there was the slogan 'quit India', today the slogan is 'add India'
 vyakti-vyakti ko hamane saath lenaa he, jan-jan ko saath lenaa he, samaaj ke har tabake ko saath lenaa he, or usee ko le karke hamen desh ko aage badhanaa he
 We need a strong economy to build a prosperous India
 santulit vikaas chahie, next generation infrastructure chahie, tab ja kar ke hamaare sapanom ke bharat ko ham apni ankhon ke saamne dekh sakate hai
 Brothers and sisters, we have taken countless decisions in three years
 kuch chizon ko notice kiya gaya he or kuch chijen shaayad notice main nahin ai
 But one thing is important
 jab aap itnaa bada badlaav karte he to rukvaaten aati hai, gati ruk jaati he
 But see the working style of this government, if the train also passes near a railway station, when the track changes, the speed running from 60 has to be brought to the speed of 30
 trek badalane par train kii speed kam ho jaati he
 We are trying to take the whole country to a new track, but we have not let his speed down, we have kept his pace
 chaahe GST laaen ho, koi bhi kanoon laaen ho, koi bhi nai vyavastha laae ho, ham usko karne main safal hue he or aage bhi isko ham karenge
 We have laid emphasis on infrastructure
 abhootpurv kharch infrastructure par die ja rahe hai
 The railway station should be modernized, in a small town, whether to build an airport, whether to arrange water-way, whether to arrange roadways, whether to build gas grid, whether to grid water, whether to do optical fiber network , We are giving full emphasis on all types of modern infrastructure
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, 21veen sadi main bharat ko aage badhaane kaa sabase urjavan kshetra he, hamaara purvi hindustan
 There is so much potential, powerful human resource, immense natural wealth, rich of hard work, and ability to change life by resolving
 hamaara puraa dhyaan purvi uttar pradesh, bihar, bengal, assam, north east, odisha, ye hamaare aise samarthyavan rajya hai, jahaan prakritik sampada bharpoor he, usko aage badhaakar ke desh ko ek nai oonchai par le jane kii disha main ham prayatnrat he
 Brothers and sisters, corruption-free India is a very important task, we are trying to strengthen it
 sarkaar banane ke baad pehla kaam kiya tha SIT banane kaa
 Today, after three years, i want to tell the countrymen, proudly tell them that within three years, we have discovered more than about 1
25 lakh crore rupees of black money, caught it and suurender it
 Is forced
 uske baad hamane notebandi kaa faisla kiya
 We have achieved many significant successes through demonetisation
 jo kalaadhan chipa hua tha, usko mukhyadhara main aana padaa
 You must have seen that we sometimes used to extend 07 days-10 days-15 days, sometimes at the petrol pump, sometimes at the drugstore, sometimes at the railway station, we continued to take old notes, because our effort was once Money should also become a part of the formal economy in the banks and we have successfully completed that work
 or iskaa kaaran yah hua he ki abhi jo research hua he, kareeb teen lakh karod rupye
 
 
 This government has not done research, outside experts have done it
 notebandi ke baad teen lakh karod rupye, jo atirikt, jo kabhi banking system main waapas nahin aata tha wo aayaa he
 More than a quarter of a million rupees in the amount deposited in banks is under suspicion
 kam se kam do lakh karod rupye se zyada kalaadhan usko bainko tak pahunchnaa padaa he or ab vyavastha ke saath unako apana jawaab dene ke liye majaboor hue hai
 The new black money has also come to a great halt
 is varsh, iskaa parinaam dekhie, 01 april se 05 agast tak income tax return daakhil karne vaale nae vyaktigat karadaataaon kii sankhya 56 lakh
 In the same period last year, this number was only 2
2 million
 Double se bhi zyada! ye kaaran kaledhan ke khilaaf hamaari ladaai kaa parinaam he
 More than 18 lakh people have been identified, whose income is more than the book according to them, they are uncountable and hence they have to answer this difference
 saadhe chaar lakh log isamen se ab maidan main aaye hai, apni galati sweekaar karke raste main aane kaa prayaas kar rahe hai
 One lakh people have come forward, who had never heard of income tax in life, nor had ever given income tax, nor had they thought of it, but today they have to do it
 bhaaiyon bahanon, hamaare desh main agar do chaar companiyaan bhi kahin band ho jaae, to choubison ghante us par charchaaen hoti hai us par Debates hoti hai
 Economy is over


 it is done, no matter what happens! You'd be surprised to know, black money traders, Shell used to run companies and after demonetisation when data-mining was done
 tab teen lakh aisi companiyaan pai gayi hai, jo sirf or sirf shell companiyaan hai
 Does hawala business
 teen lakh, koi kalpana kar saktaa he
 And we have canceled the registration of one and a half lakh from that
 paanch companiyaan band ho jaae to hindustan main tufaan much jaataa he
 Locked up to twenty two lakh companies
 desh kaa maal luutane waalon ko jawaab dena padegaa, ye kaam hamane kar ke dikhaaya
 You will be surprised! Some shell companies are such that four hundred and four hundred companies were running at the same address, brothers and sisters
 chaar sau chaar sau companiyaan chal rahi thim
 Nobody was going to see, nobody was going to ask
 sari mileebhagat chal rahi thi
 And so my brothers and sisters, i have waged a very big fight against corruption black money
 desh kii bhalaai ke liye desh ke garibon ke kalyaan ke liye, desh ke naujavaanon ke bhavishya ko banane ke liye
 Brothers and sisters, one step after the other, and i am sure it will increase further after GST
 or Transparency aane vaali he
 Transportation alone Our truck used to go from one place to another
 ye GST ke baad tees pratishat uskaa samay batch gaya he
 Thousands of crores of rupees have been saved due to the end of check-post
 sabase badi bachat samay kii hui he
 In a way, its thirty percent efficiency is increasing
 aap kalpana kar sakate hai hindustan ke Transport jagat main tees pratishat Efficiency badhane kaa matlab kya hota he
 a GST has brought about such a big change
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, aaj notebandi ke kaaran bainko ke paas dhan aayaa he
 Banks are reducing their interest rate
 mudra ke dwaara saamaanya maanav ko bank se paisa mil rahaa he
 The common man is getting an opportunity to stand on his feet
 garib ho, madhyavarg kaa vyakti ho ghar bananaa chahta he, to bank usko madad karne ke liye aage aa rahe hai, kam byaaj kii dar se aage aa rahe hai
 It is working towards accelerating the economy of the country
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, ab ye vakt badal chukaa he
 We are in the 21st century
 vishwa kaa sabase bada yuva varg hamaare desh main he
 Our identity in the world is by IT, by Digital World
 kya ab bhi ham usee pooraani soch main rahenge
 Hey! Once upon a time, leather coins used to move, slowly disappeared, no one was asking
 aaj jo kaagaj ke note hai, samay aate rahete wo sara kaa sara Digital Currency main Convert hone vaala he
 Let us lead, let us take responsibility, let us go towards Digital Transaction
 ham BHIM APP ko apanaaen, aarthik kaarobaar kaa hissaa banaaen
 We also work through Prepaid
 or mujhe khushi he ki Digital lenden badi he
 It has increased by 34 percent over the previous year and about 44 percent in prepaid payments
 or isaliye kam cash vaali arthvyavastha, usko lekar ke hamen aage badhanaa chahie
 My dear countrymen, there are some schemes of the government that can save money in the pockets of the common man of India
 agar aap LED Bulb lagaate hai, to saal bhar kaa hajaar do hajaar paanch hajaar rupaya aapkaa bachane vaala he
 If you succeed in a clean India, then the poor's medicine of seven thousand rupees stops
 mahangaai par niyantran, aapke badhate hue kharch ko rokane main safal hua he, ek prakaar se aapaki bachat he
 Affordable medicine shops have become a huge blessing for the poor through 'jan Aushadhi Kendras'
 hamaare yahaan Operation ke peeche, stent ke peeche jo kharch hote the wo kam hue hai
 In the coming days, all facilities will also be available for Knee's operation
 hamaari koshish he ki garib or madhyamvarg ke maanav ke liye ye kharch kam ho or uske liye ham ek ke baad ek kadam uthaa rahe hai
 Earlier, dialysis used to take place in the headquarters of the states in our country
 hamane tay kiya hindustan ke jila kendron tak Dialysis pahunchaayenge
 Nearly three and a half hundred and four hundred districts have been reached and by dialysis for free, we are working to save the life of the poor
 aaj desh garv kar saktaa he ki hamane vishwa ke saamne apni vyavasthaaon ko viksit kiya he
 Today we have succeeded in arranging NAVIC Navigation through GPS System
 hamane SAARC Satellite ke dwaara hamane padosi deshon ke saath madad karne kaa safal abhiyaan kiya he
 We are delivering our importance inside the world today by 'tejas' airplane
 ‘BHIM-AADHAR App’ duniya ke andar Digital Transaction ke liye ek ajooba bana hua he
 rupay Card
 
 
 hindustan main rupay Card karodon kii taadaad main he
 And if it becomes operational, if it is in the pocket of the poor, then it will become the largest in the world
 or isaliye mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, meraa aapse yahi aagrah he ki ham ‘new India’ kaa sankalp le kar ke aage badhen, samay rahete hue karen
 It is said in our scriptures: Aniyat Kaal: Aniyat Kaal: Prabhutyo Viplavante, Prabhutayo Viplavante
 sahi samay par agar koi kaary puraa nahin kiya gaya, to phir icchit parinaam kabhi nahin milte hai
 And so for 'team India', for Team India of 1
25 billion countrymen, today we have to pledge to make 'new India' by 2022 and we will do this work ourselves, no one will do it, we will do it ourselves
 desh ke liye karenge, pehle se acha karenge, pehle se zyada karenge, samarpan bhav se karenge, 2022 main ‘bhavy-divya’ hindustan dekhne ke liye karenge
 And that's why we will all together create an India where the poor have a pucca house, electricity, water
 ham sab milakar ek aisa bharat banaaenge, jahaan desh kaa kisaan chintaa main nahin chaiyn se soyega
 By 2022, he will earn twice as much as he is earning today
 ham sab milakar ke ek aisa hindustan banaaenge, jahaan yuvaaon, mahilaon ko apane sapane puure karne ke liye bharpoor avasar uplabdh honge
 Together we will create an India that will be free from terrorism, communalism and casteism
 ham sab milakar ke ek aisa bharat banaaenge, jahaan bhrashtachar or bhai-bhatijawad se koi samjhauta nahin hoga
 Together we will create an India that will be clean, healthy and fulfill the dream of Swaraj
 or isaliye mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, ham sab milakar ke vikaas kii is daud main aage chalane kaa prayaas karenge
 Today, after 70 years of independence, in the midst of waiting for 75 years of independence, in the important tenure of five years, all of us countrymen should go with the dream of a 'divine-grand India', with this same sentiment i once again i bow to the crazy people
 sava sau karod deshavaasiyon ke nae vishwaas, nai umang ko naman karata hum
 And call upon 'team India' to move forward with a new resolution
 isi bhaavana ke saath aap sabko hriday se meri bahut bahut shubhakamanaayen
 Bharat Mata Ki Jai, Vande Mataram Jai Hind
 jai hind, jai hind, jai hind, jai hind
 Bharat Mata Ki Jai, Bharat Mata Ki Jai, Bharat Mata Ki Jai
 vande maataram, vande maataram, vande maataram, vande maataram
 The comments sabhi kaa bahut bahut dhanyavad
 Sincerely: PIB GST ke saath-saath chaahe Smart City ke nirmaan kii baat ho, chaahe swatchta kaa abhiyaan ho, chaahe toilet kii charchaa ho, Ease of doing Business kii baat ho, yah saare vishay aise hai ki hamaare desh ke sabhi rajya kandhe se kandhaa mila karke aaj bharat ke saath bharat kii sarkaar, kandhe se kandhaa mila karke rajya ke saath chalane main bahut safal ho rahi he
 My dear countrymen 'new India' is our greatest strength, democracy
 lekin ham jaanate hai ki hamane loktantr ko mat-patr tak simit kar diya he
 Democracy cannot be limited to ballot papers
 or isliye ham ‘new India’ main us loktantr par bal dena chaahate hai jisamen tantra se lok nahin, lekin logon se tantra chale, aisa loktantr ‘new India’ kii pahchaan bane, us disha main ham janaa chaahate hai
 Lokmanya Tilak ji had said, 'swarajya is my birth right'
 aaazaad bharat me ham sabakaa mantra hona chahie, ‘surajya meraa janmasiddh adhikaar he’
 'state' should be the responsibility of all of us
 naagarik ko apni jimmedaariyaan nibhaani chahie, sarkaron ne apni jimmedaariyaan nibhaani chahie
 When we have to walk from 'swarajya to Surajya', the countrymen do not stay back
 jab maine gas sabsidi chhodane ke liye kaha, desh aage aayaa
 Speaking of cleanliness, even today, in every corner of India, some one is carrying forward the cleanliness drive
 jab notebandi kii baat ai, duniya ko aashcharya hua tha, yahaan tak log kah rahe the, ab modi gaya
 But the patience of the 125 crore countrymen who showed in demonetisation, the faith that they told and the result of that, today we are succeeding in taking steps against corruption
 hamaare desh ke liye is nai lokbhagidaari kii parampara
 
 
 It is our effort to advance the country by public participation
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, laal bahadur shastri ne jai jawan jai kisaan kaa mantra diya tha
 The farmer of our country has never looked back, our farmer is giving record crop production today
 prakritik aapadaaon ke bich main nai–nai siddhiyaan wo hasil kar rahaa he
 There has been a record production of pulses and my dear brothers and sisters, my farmer brothers and sisters, there has never been a tradition of buying pulses in government in India and once in a while, according to thousands of tons It used to be, this time when the farmers of my country produced pulses and served nutritious food to the poor, the government increased this work by doing the historic work of buying 16 lakh tons of pulses Have received
 pradhanmantri fasal beemaa yojana, ek suraksha kavach mere kisaan bhaiyon ko mila he
 Three years ago, only 1
25 crore farmers used to take advantage of this Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, which was earlier known by another name
 aaj pradhanmantri fasal beemaa yojana main itane kam samay main kai naye kisaan iske saath jud gaye hai or kareeb-kareeb ye sankhya aage chalakar ke paune chah karod par pahunchi he
 The Prime Minister Agricultural Irrigation Scheme, if the farmer gets water, has the power to produce gold from the soil and so to provide water to the farmer last time i told the Red Fort, we have completed 21 of those schemes and the rest 50 plans will be completed in the coming time
 or total 99 yojanaon kaa maine sankalp liya he
 We will complete the water supply to the farmer's farm by completing those 99 big plans before 2019
 or kisaan ko beej se bazaar tak, jab tak ham vyastha nahin dete hai, hamaare kisaan ke bhagya ko ham nahin badal sakate hai
 And therefore it needs infrastructure, it needs supply-chain
 har saal lakhon-karodon rupayon kii hamaari sabji, hamaare fal, hamaari fasal barbaad ho jaati he or isliye usko badalane ke liye ek to Foreign Direct Investment ko badhaava diya taaki food processing ke andar duniya hamaare saath jude
 Promoted to create infrastructure and Government of India has implemented 'pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojana'
 jiske kaaran un vyavasthaaon kaa nirmaan kiya jayega jo beej se bazaar tak kisaan ko hand-holding karenge, vyavasthaaen viksit karenge or hamaare karodon kisaanon kii jindagi main ek nayaa badlaav laane main ham safal honge
 Due to Demand and Technology, the nature of job is also changing in our country
 rojgaar se judi yojanaon main, training ke tareeke main 21veen sadi kii aavashyaktaaon ke anusaar, maanav sansaadhan ke vikaas ke liye bharat sarkaar ne anek nai yojanaayen haath main lee hai
 a huge campaign has been launched to ensure that the youth get money from banks without guarantee
 hamaara noujvaan apane pairon par khadaa ho, wo rojgaar paane vaala rahe, rojgaar dene vaala bane, or pichley teen saal main dekha he ki ‘pradhanmantri mudra yojana’ ke kaaran karodon noujvaan apane pairon par khadey hue hai
 Not only this, a young man is also employing one or two to three more people
 shiksha ke kshetra main World Class Universities banane ke liye hamane bandhanon se mukti dene kaa ek bada ahm kadam uthaaya he
 20 Universities have been called upon to decide their fate, Government will not come anywhere
 upar se sarkaar 1000 karod rupee tak kii madad karne ke liye bhi taiyaar he
 Has given a call, i am sure the educational institutions of my country will definitely come forward and make it successful
 pichley teen varsh main 6 IIT, 7 nae IIM, 8 nae IIIT, iskaa nirmaan kiya he or shiksha ko naukari ke avasaron ke saath jodne kaa bhi is ko kaam hamane kiya he
 My mothers, sisters, today, in large quantities, women in the family also go for employment
 or isliye raatri ko bhi unako rojgaar kaa avasar mili, factoriyon main kaam karne kaa avasar mili, isliye Labour Laws main parivartan karne kaa bahut bada ahm kadam uthaaya he
 Our mothers and sisters are also an important unit of the family
 hamaara bhavishya nirmaan karne ke liye hamaari maataaon, bahanon kaa yogadan bahut bada hota he, or isliye Maternity Leave jo 12 saptaah kii thi, wo 26 saptaah, usamen aay chaalu rahegi, is prakaar se dene kaa kaam kiya he
 With regard to the work of empowerment of our women today, in particular, i would like to congratulate the sisters who have been forced to live a very difficult life due to triple talaq
 koi aashray nahin bachaa he, or aisi peedit, teen-talaak se peedit bahanon ne puure desh main ek andolan khadaa kiya he
 The intellectual class of the country was shaken, the media of the country also helped them, an atmosphere was created against triple talaq in the whole country
 is andolan ko chalaane vaali un meri bahanon ko, jo teen-talaak ke khilaaf ladai lard rahi hai, main hriday se unka abhindann karata hum or mujhe vishwaas he, ki maataaon-bahanon ko adhikaar dilaane main, unki is ladaai main hindustan unki puri madad karegaa
 Hindustan will help and it will be successful in this important step of Women Empowerment; i am sure of this
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyo, kabhi-kabhi aasthaa ke naam par dhairya ke abhaav main kuch log aisi chijen kar baithte hai, jo samaaj ke taane-bane ko bikher detii hai
 The country operates with peace, goodwill and unity
 jatvaad kaa jehar, sampradayawad kaa jehar, desh kaa kabhi bhala nahin kar saktaa he
 This is Gandhi's land, Buddha's land, take everyone along and walk; It is part of the culture and tradition of this country
 hamen isko safalataa se aage badhanaa he, or isliye aasthaa ke naam par hinsa ko bal nahin diya ja saktaa he
 If something happens to the patient in the hospital, the hospital is burnt; Accidentally, carts should be burnt; Move, government property be burned; Whose is this for Azad Hindustan? We have assets of 1
25 billion countrymen
 ye saanskrithik viraasat kiski he? ye ham sava sau karod deshavaasiyon kii saanskrithik viraasat he
 Whose faith is this? We are the faith of 125 crore countrymen; And so the path of violence in the name of faith can never go on in this country, this country can never accept
 or isliye main deshavaasiyon se aagrah karuunga, us samay ‘bharat chodo’ kaa naaraa tha, aaj naaraa he ‘bharat jodo’
 We have to take person-to-person, take people-to-people, we have to take every section of the society together, and we have to take the country forward by taking the same
 samrudh bharat banane ke liye hamaari majboot arthvyavastha chahie
 We need balanced development, next generation infrastructure, then we can see the India of our dreams in front of our eyes
 bhaaiyo-bahanon, anginat nirnay hamane teen saal main liye
 Some things have been noted and some things may not have come into notice
 lekin ek baat mahatvapurn he
 When you make such a big change, the stops come, the speed stops
 lekin is sarkaar kii kaaryastylee dekhie, agar train bhi kisi railway stesan ke paas se guzarati he, jab trek badalati he to 60 se chalane vaali speed ko usko 30 kii speed main laana padataa he
 The speed of the train decreases by changing the track
 ham puure desh ko ek nae trek par le jane kaa prayaas kar rahe hai, lekin hamane uski speed kam nahin hone di he, hamane uski gati ko barkaraar rakhaa he
 Whether we bring GST, any law, any new system, we have succeeded in doing that and we will do it in future
 hamane infrastructure par bal diya he
 Unprecedented expenses are being given on infrastructure
 railway stesan kaa aadhunikeekaran ho, chote shahar main, chaahe airport bananaa ho, chaahe water-way kii vyavastha kerani ho, chaahe roadways kii vyavastha kerani ho, chaahe gas grid banani ho, chaahe pani kii grid karaani ho, chaahe optical fibre network karnaa ho, har prakaar ke aadhunik infrastructure par ham purna bal de rahe hai
 My dear countrymen, our eastern India is the most energetic field to advance India in the 21st century
 itnaa potential he, samarthyavan maanav sansaadhan he, apaar prakritik sampada he, parishram ke dhani hai, sankalp karke jindagi badalane kaa samarthy rakhte hai
 Our entire focus is on eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Bengal, Assam, North East, Odisha, these are our powerful states, where natural wealth is abundant, we are trying to take the country to a new height by taking it forward
 bhaaiyo-bahanon, bhrashtachar mukt bharat ek bada ahm kaam he, usko ham bal dene kaa prayaas kar rahe he
 After the formation of the government, the first task was to create SIT
 aaj teen saal ke baad main deshavaasiyon ko bataanaa chahta hum, garv se bataanaa chahta hum ki teen saal ke bheetar-bheetar, kareeb-kareeb sava lakh karod rupye se bhi zyada kalaadhan ko hamane khoj diya he, usko pakadaa he or usko suurender karne ke liye majaboor kiya he
 After that we decided to demonetise
 notebandi ke dwaara hamane anek mahatvapurn safaltaaen praapt kii hai
 The black money that was hidden had to come into the mainstream
 aapane dekha hoga ki ham kabhi 07 din-10 din-15 din badhaate jate the, kabhi petrol pump par, kabhi dawaai kii dukaan par, kabhi railway stesan par puraane note lene kaa silsilaa jari rakhte the, kyonki hamaara prayaas tha ki ek baar jo bhi dhan aae wo bainkon main formal economy kaa hissaa ban jaae or us kaam ko hamane safaltaapurvak paar kiya he
 And the reason for this is that the research that has been done now, is about three lakh crore rupees
 
 
 ye sarkaar ne research nahin kii he, baahar ke expert ne kii he
 Three lakh crore rupees after demonetisation, the additional, which never came back in the banking system, has come
 bainkon main jamaa kii gai raashi main paune do lakh karod se adhik raashi shaq ke ghere main he
 At least two lakh crore rupees of black money has had to reach the banks and now they are forced to give their answers with the system
 nae kaledhan par bhi bahut badi rukaawat aa gai he
 This year, see the result, 56 lakh new taxpayers filing income tax returns from 01 April to 05 August
 pichley saal usee avadhi main ye sankhya sirf 22 lakh thi
 More than double! These reasons are the result of our fight against black money
 18 lakh se zyada aise logon ko pahchaan liya gaya he, jinaki aay unke hisaab kitaab se kuch zyada he, beshumaar zyada he or isaliye is antar kaa unako jawaab dena pad rahaa he
 Out of this, four and a half lakh people have now come to the field, accepting their mistake and trying to get in the way
 ek lakh log aise saamne aae hai, jinhone kabhi jindagi main Income Tax kaa naam bhi nahin suna tha, na Income Tax kabhi diya tha, na kabhi unhone us par sochaa tha, lekin aaj unako wo karnaa pad rahaa he
 Brothers and sisters, if two or four companies are shut down in our country, then there are discussions on them round the clock
 arthniti khatm ho gai


 ye ho gaya, na jane kya kya hota he! aapako jaanakar ke hairaani hogi, kaale dhan ke kaarobaari, Shell companiyaan chalaate the or notebandi ke baad jab data-mining kiya gaya
 Then three lakh such companies have been found, which are just and shell companies only
 hawala kaa kaarobaar karti hai
 Three lakhs, one can imagine
 or usamen se paune do lakh kaa registration hamanen Cancel kar diya he
 If five companies are closed, then there is a storm in India
 paune do lakh companiyon ko taale laga diye
 Those who looted the goods of the country will have to answer, we did this by doing this
 aapako hairaani hogi! kuch to shell companiyaan aisi hai, jo ek hi Address par chaar sau chaar sau companiyaan chal rahi thim, bhaaiyon bahanon
 Four hundred and four hundred companies were operating
 koi dekhne vaala nahin tha, koi poochne vaala nahin tha
 All the collusion was going on
 or isaliye mere bhaaiyon bahanon, maine bhrashtachar kaale dhan ke khilaaf ek bahut badi ladaai chhedi he
 For the betterment of the country, for the welfare of the poor of the country, for the future of the youth of the country
 bhaaiyon bahanon, ek ke baad ek kadam or mujhe vishwaas he GST ke baad usamen or badhotaree hone vaali he
 And Transparency is forthcoming
 akele Transportation hamaara trek vaala ek sthaan se duusare sthaan par jaataa tha
 After this GST, thirty percent of his time is saved
 check-post khatm hone ke kaaran hajaaron karod rupayon kii to bachat hui he
 The biggest savings have been time
 ek prakaar se uski tees pratishat Efficiency bad rahi he
 You can imagine what it means to increase thirty percent efficiency in the transport world of India
 ek GST ke kaaran itnaa bada parivartan aayaa he
 My dear countrymen, today money has come to banks due to demonetisation
 bank apni byaaj dar kam kar rahe hai
 The common man is getting money from the bank through currency
 saamaanya maanav ko apane pairon par khadey hone ke liye avasar mil rahaa he
 Be poor, a middle class person wants to build a house, then banks are coming forward to help him, coming at a lower rate of interest
 ye sara desh ke arthtantr ko gati dene kii disha main kaam kar rahaa he
 My dear countrymen, now is the time
 ham 21veen sadi main hai
 The largest youth group in the world is in our country
 duniya main hamaari pahchaan IT ke dwaara he, Digital World ke dwaara he
 Will we still remain in the same old thinking? are! ek jamaane main chamade ke sikke chalate the, dhire-dhire lupt ho gaye, koi poochne vaala nahin rahaa
 Today the paper notes are going to be converted into digital currency all the time
 ham netritv karen, ham jimmevary len, ham Digital Transaction kii ore jaaen
 We adopt BHIM APP, become part of economic business
 ham Prepaid ke dwaara bhi kaam karen
 And i am happy that Digital transactions have grown
 pichley saal ke mukaable usamen 34 pratishat kaa ijapha hua he or Prepaid bhugtan main kareeb 44 pratishat kaa
 And that's why we should go ahead with a low cash economy
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, sarkaar kii kuch yojanaayen aisi hai, jo hindustan ke saamaanya maanav kii jeb main paise bachaa saken
 If you put an LED bulb, then a thousand rupees two thousand five thousand rupees of the year are going to save you
 agar aap svachh bharat main safal hote hai, to garib kaa saat hajaar kaa rupaya dawaai kaa band hota he
 Controlling inflation has been successful in curbing your rising expenses, in a way your savings
 ‘jan aushadhi kendron’ ke dwaara sasti dawaai kii dukaan garib ke liye ek bahut bada aashirwad bani he
 The expenses that were behind our operation, behind the stent, have come down
 aane vaale dinon main Knee ke Operation ke liye bhi sari suvidhaayen milengi
 Our effort is to reduce these expenses for the poor and middle class human beings and for that we are taking steps one after the other
 pehle hamaare desh main rajyon ke mukhyalay main Dialysis hua karata tha
 We decided to deliver dialysis to the district centers of India
 kareeb saadhe teen sau, chaar sau jilon tak pahunchaa diya or muft main Dialysis karke garib kii jindagi bachaane kaa kaam ham kar rahe hai
 Today the country can be proud that we have developed our systems in front of the world
 GPS System ke dwaara NAVIC Navigation kii vyavastha aaj karne main ham safal hue hai
 Through SAARC Satellite, we have successfully campaigned to help with neighboring countries
 ham ‘tejas’ hawaii jahaaj ke dwaara aaj duniya ke andar apni ahmiyat pahunchaa rahe hai
 The 'BHIM-AADHAR App' is a wonder within the world for Digital Transaction
 rupay Card 
 
 
 In India, rupay Card is worth crores
 or agar wo operational ho jayega, wo agar garibon ke jeb main he, to duniya kaa, ye sabase bada ho jayega
 And that's why my dear countrymen, i request you to move ahead by taking a pledge for 'new India', and do it in time
 hamaare yahaan shastron main kaha gaya haih aniyat kaal:, aniyat kaalah prabhutayo viplavante, prabhutayo viplavante
 If a task is not completed at the right time, then the desired result is never achieved
 or isaliye ‘team India’ ke liye, sava sau karod deshavaasiyon kii team India ke liye, aaj hamen sankalp lenaa hoga 2022 tak ‘new India’ banane kaa or ye kaam ham khud karenge, koi karegaa aisa nahin, ham khud karenge
 Will do for the country, will do better than before, will do more than before, will do it with dedication, in 2022 to see 'grand-divine' Hindustan
 or isaliye ham sab milakar ke ek aisa bharat banaaenge jahaan garib ke paas pakkaa ghar ho, bijli ho, pani ho
 Together we will create an India where the farmer of the country will sleep peacefully
 aaj wo jitna kama rahaa he, usase 2022 tak doguna kamayega
 Together we will create an India where youth and women will have ample opportunities to fulfill their dreams
 ham sab milakar ke ek aisa bharat banaaenge, jo aatankwaad sampradayawad or jatvaad se mukt hoga
 Together we will create an India where there will be no compromise on corruption and nepotism
 ham sab milakar ke ek aisa bharat banaaenge, jo svachh hoga, swasth hoga or swaraj ke sapane ko puraa karegaa
 And therefore my dear countrymen, we will all try to work together in this race of development
 aaj aazaadee ke 70 saal ke baad, aazaadee ke 75 saal kii pratiksha ke bich paanch saal ke mahatvapurn kaarykaal main ek ‘divya-bhavy bharat’ ke sapane ko lekar ke ham sabhi deshvasi chalem, isi ek bhav ke saath main phir ek baar aazaadee ke diwaanon ko pranaam karata hum
 i salute the new faith, new zeal of 1
25 billion countrymen
 or nae sankalp ke saath aage chalane ke liye ‘team India’ ko aahvaan karata hum
 With this feeling, my heartiest greetings to all of you

 saabhaar: PIB My dear countrymen 'new India' is our greatest strength, democracy
 lekin ham jaanate hai ki hamane loktantr ko mat-patr tak simit kar diya he
 Democracy cannot be limited to ballot papers
 or isliye ham ‘new India’ main us loktantr par bal dena chaahate hai jisamen tantra se lok nahin, lekin logon se tantra chale, aisa loktantr ‘new India’ kii pahchaan bane, us disha main ham janaa chaahate hai
 Lokmanya Tilak ji had said, 'swarajya is my birth right'
 aaazaad bharat me ham sabakaa mantra hona chahie, ‘surajya meraa janmasiddh adhikaar he’
 'state' should be the responsibility of all of us
 naagarik ko apni jimmedaariyaan nibhaani chahie, sarkaron ne apni jimmedaariyaan nibhaani chahie
 When we have to walk from 'swarajya to Surajya', the countrymen do not stay back
 jab maine gas sabsidi chhodane ke liye kaha, desh aage aayaa
 Speaking of cleanliness, even today, in every corner of India, some one is carrying forward the cleanliness drive
 jab notebandi kii baat ai, duniya ko aashcharya hua tha, yahaan tak log kah rahe the, ab modi gaya
 But the patience of the 125 crore countrymen who showed in demonetisation, the faith that they told and the result of that, today we are succeeding in taking steps against corruption
 hamaare desh ke liye is nai lokbhagidaari kii parampara
 
 
 It is our effort to advance the country by public participation
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, laal bahadur shastri ne jai jawan jai kisaan kaa mantra diya tha
 The farmer of our country has never looked back, our farmer is giving record crop production today
 prakritik aapadaaon ke bich main nai–nai siddhiyaan wo hasil kar rahaa he
 There has been a record production of pulses and my dear brothers and sisters, my farmer brothers and sisters, there has never been a tradition of buying pulses in government in India and once in a while, according to thousands of tons It used to be, this time when the farmers of my country produced pulses and served nutritious food to the poor, the government increased this work by doing the historic work of buying 16 lakh tons of pulses Have received
 pradhanmantri fasal beemaa yojana, ek suraksha kavach mere kisaan bhaiyon ko mila he
 Three years ago, only 1
25 crore farmers used to take advantage of this Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, which was earlier known by another name
 aaj pradhanmantri fasal beemaa yojana main itane kam samay main kai naye kisaan iske saath jud gaye hai or kareeb-kareeb ye sankhya aage chalakar ke paune chah karod par pahunchi he
 The Prime Minister Agricultural Irrigation Scheme, if the farmer gets water, has the power to produce gold from the soil and so to provide water to the farmer last time i told the Red Fort, we have completed 21 of those schemes and the rest 50 plans will be completed in the coming time
 or total 99 yojanaon kaa maine sankalp liya he
 We will complete the water supply to the farmer's farm by completing those 99 big plans before 2019
 or kisaan ko beej se bazaar tak, jab tak ham vyastha nahin dete hai, hamaare kisaan ke bhagya ko ham nahin badal sakate hai
 And therefore it needs infrastructure, it needs supply-chain
 har saal lakhon-karodon rupayon kii hamaari sabji, hamaare fal, hamaari fasal barbaad ho jaati he or isliye usko badalane ke liye ek to Foreign Direct Investment ko badhaava diya taaki food processing ke andar duniya hamaare saath jude
 Promoted to create infrastructure and Government of India has implemented 'pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojana'
 jiske kaaran un vyavasthaaon kaa nirmaan kiya jayega jo beej se bazaar tak kisaan ko hand-holding karenge, vyavasthaaen viksit karenge or hamaare karodon kisaanon kii jindagi main ek nayaa badlaav laane main ham safal honge
 Due to Demand and Technology, the nature of job is also changing in our country
 rojgaar se judi yojanaon main, training ke tareeke main 21veen sadi kii aavashyaktaaon ke anusaar, maanav sansaadhan ke vikaas ke liye bharat sarkaar ne anek nai yojanaayen haath main lee hai
 a huge campaign has been launched to ensure that the youth get money from banks without guarantee
 hamaara noujvaan apane pairon par khadaa ho, wo rojgaar paane vaala rahe, rojgaar dene vaala bane, or pichley teen saal main dekha he ki ‘pradhanmantri mudra yojana’ ke kaaran karodon noujvaan apane pairon par khadey hue hai
 Not only this, a young man is also employing one or two to three more people
 shiksha ke kshetra main World Class Universities banane ke liye hamane bandhanon se mukti dene kaa ek bada ahm kadam uthaaya he
 20 Universities have been called upon to decide their fate, Government will not come anywhere
 upar se sarkaar 1000 karod rupee tak kii madad karne ke liye bhi taiyaar he
 Has given a call, i am sure the educational institutions of my country will definitely come forward and make it successful
 pichley teen varsh main 6 IIT, 7 nae IIM, 8 nae IIIT, iskaa nirmaan kiya he or shiksha ko naukari ke avasaron ke saath jodne kaa bhi is ko kaam hamane kiya he
 My mothers, sisters, today, in large quantities, women in the family also go for employment
 or isliye raatri ko bhi unako rojgaar kaa avasar mili, factoriyon main kaam karne kaa avasar mili, isliye Labour Laws main parivartan karne kaa bahut bada ahm kadam uthaaya he
 Our mothers and sisters are also an important unit of the family
 hamaara bhavishya nirmaan karne ke liye hamaari maataaon, bahanon kaa yogadan bahut bada hota he, or isliye Maternity Leave jo 12 saptaah kii thi, wo 26 saptaah, usamen aay chaalu rahegi, is prakaar se dene kaa kaam kiya he
 With regard to the work of empowerment of our women today, in particular, i would like to congratulate the sisters who have been forced to live a very difficult life due to triple talaq
 koi aashray nahin bachaa he, or aisi peedit, teen-talaak se peedit bahanon ne puure desh main ek andolan khadaa kiya he
 The intellectual class of the country was shaken, the media of the country also helped them, an atmosphere was created against triple talaq in the whole country
 is andolan ko chalaane vaali un meri bahanon ko, jo teen-talaak ke khilaaf ladai lard rahi hai, main hriday se unka abhindann karata hum or mujhe vishwaas he, ki maataaon-bahanon ko adhikaar dilaane main, unki is ladaai main hindustan unki puri madad karegaa
 Hindustan will help and it will be successful in this important step of Women Empowerment; i am sure of this
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyo, kabhi-kabhi aasthaa ke naam par dhairya ke abhaav main kuch log aisi chijen kar baithte hai, jo samaaj ke taane-bane ko bikher detii hai
 The country operates with peace, goodwill and unity
 jatvaad kaa jehar, sampradayawad kaa jehar, desh kaa kabhi bhala nahin kar saktaa he
 This is Gandhi's land, Buddha's land, take everyone along and walk; It is part of the culture and tradition of this country
 hamen isko safalataa se aage badhanaa he, or isliye aasthaa ke naam par hinsa ko bal nahin diya ja saktaa he
 If something happens to the patient in the hospital, the hospital is burnt; Accidentally, carts should be burnt; Move, government property be burned; Whose is this for Azad Hindustan? We have assets of 1
25 billion countrymen
 ye saanskrithik viraasat kiski he? ye ham sava sau karod deshavaasiyon kii saanskrithik viraasat he
 Whose faith is this? We are the faith of 125 crore countrymen; And so the path of violence in the name of faith can never go on in this country, this country can never accept
 or isliye main deshavaasiyon se aagrah karuunga, us samay ‘bharat chodo’ kaa naaraa tha, aaj naaraa he ‘bharat jodo’
 We have to take person-to-person, take people-to-people, we have to take every section of the society together, and we have to take the country forward by taking the same
 samrudh bharat banane ke liye hamaari majboot arthvyavastha chahie
 We need balanced development, next generation infrastructure, then we can see the India of our dreams in front of our eyes
 bhaaiyo-bahanon, anginat nirnay hamane teen saal main liye
 Some things have been noted and some things may not have come into notice
 lekin ek baat mahatvapurn he
 When you make such a big change, the stops come, the speed stops
 lekin is sarkaar kii kaaryastylee dekhie, agar train bhi kisi railway stesan ke paas se guzarati he, jab trek badalati he to 60 se chalane vaali speed ko usko 30 kii speed main laana padataa he
 The speed of the train decreases by changing the track
 ham puure desh ko ek nae trek par le jane kaa prayaas kar rahe hai, lekin hamane uski speed kam nahin hone di he, hamane uski gati ko barkaraar rakhaa he
 Whether we bring GST, any law, any new system, we have succeeded in doing that and we will do it in future
 hamane infrastructure par bal diya he
 Unprecedented expenses are being given on infrastructure
 railway stesan kaa aadhunikeekaran ho, chote shahar main, chaahe airport bananaa ho, chaahe water-way kii vyavastha kerani ho, chaahe roadways kii vyavastha kerani ho, chaahe gas grid banani ho, chaahe pani kii grid karaani ho, chaahe optical fibre network karnaa ho, har prakaar ke aadhunik infrastructure par ham purna bal de rahe hai
 My dear countrymen, our eastern India is the most energetic field to advance India in the 21st century
 itnaa potential he, samarthyavan maanav sansaadhan he, apaar prakritik sampada he, parishram ke dhani hai, sankalp karke jindagi badalane kaa samarthy rakhte hai
 Our entire focus is on eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Bengal, Assam, North East, Odisha, these are our powerful states, where natural wealth is abundant, we are trying to take the country to a new height by taking it forward
 bhaaiyo-bahanon, bhrashtachar mukt bharat ek bada ahm kaam he, usko ham bal dene kaa prayaas kar rahe he
 After the formation of the government, the first task was to create SIT
 aaj teen saal ke baad main deshavaasiyon ko bataanaa chahta hum, garv se bataanaa chahta hum ki teen saal ke bheetar-bheetar, kareeb-kareeb sava lakh karod rupye se bhi zyada kalaadhan ko hamane khoj diya he, usko pakadaa he or usko suurender karne ke liye majaboor kiya he
 After that we decided to demonetise
 notebandi ke dwaara hamane anek mahatvapurn safaltaaen praapt kii hai
 The black money that was hidden had to come into the mainstream
 aapane dekha hoga ki ham kabhi 07 din-10 din-15 din badhaate jate the, kabhi petrol pump par, kabhi dawaai kii dukaan par, kabhi railway stesan par puraane note lene kaa silsilaa jari rakhte the, kyonki hamaara prayaas tha ki ek baar jo bhi dhan aae wo bainkon main formal economy kaa hissaa ban jaae or us kaam ko hamane safaltaapurvak paar kiya he
 And the reason for this is that the research that has been done now, is about three lakh crore rupees
 
 
 ye sarkaar ne research nahin kii he, baahar ke expert ne kii he
 Three lakh crore rupees after demonetisation, the additional, which never came back in the banking system, has come
 bainkon main jamaa kii gai raashi main paune do lakh karod se adhik raashi shaq ke ghere main he
 At least two lakh crore rupees of black money has had to reach the banks and now they are forced to give their answers with the system
 nae kaledhan par bhi bahut badi rukaawat aa gai he
 This year, see the result, 56 lakh new taxpayers filing income tax returns from 01 April to 05 August
 pichley saal usee avadhi main ye sankhya sirf 22 lakh thi
 More than double! These reasons are the result of our fight against black money
 18 lakh se zyada aise logon ko pahchaan liya gaya he, jinaki aay unke hisaab kitaab se kuch zyada he, beshumaar zyada he or isaliye is antar kaa unako jawaab dena pad rahaa he

 Brothers and sisters, if two or four companies are shut down in our country, then there are discussions on them round the clock
 arthniti khatm ho gai


 ye ho gaya, na jane kya kya hota he! aapako jaanakar ke hairaani hogi, kaale dhan ke kaarobaari, Shell companiyaan chalaate the or notebandi ke baad jab data-mining kiya gaya

 Three lakhs, one can imagine
 or usamen se paune do lakh kaa registration hamanen Cancel kar diya he
 If five companies are closed, then there is a storm in India
 paune do lakh companiyon ko taale laga diye
 Those who looted the goods of the country will have to answer, we did this by doing this
 aapako hairaani hogi! kuch to shell companiyaan aisi hai, jo ek hi Address par chaar sau chaar sau companiyaan chal rahi thim, bhaaiyon bahanon
 Four hundred and four hundred companies were operating
 koi dekhne vaala nahin tha, koi poochne vaala nahin tha
 All the collusion was going on
 or isaliye mere bhaaiyon bahanon, maine bhrashtachar kaale dhan ke khilaaf ek bahut badi ladaai chhedi he
 For the betterment of the country, for the welfare of the poor of the country, for the future of the youth of the country
 bhaaiyon bahanon, ek ke baad ek kadam or mujhe vishwaas he GST ke baad usamen or badhotaree hone vaali he
 And Transparency is forthcoming
 akele Transportation hamaara trek vaala ek sthaan se duusare sthaan par jaataa tha
 After this GST, thirty percent of his time is saved
 check-post khatm hone ke kaaran hajaaron karod rupayon kii to bachat hui he

 And therefore it needs infrastructure, it needs supply-chain

 Whether we bring GST, any law, any new system, we have succeeded in doing that and we will do it in future

 My dear countrymen, our eastern India is the most energetic field to advance India in the 21st century

 Our entire focus is on eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Bengal, Assam, North East, Odisha, these are our powerful states, where natural wealth is abundant, we are trying to take the country to a new height by taking it forward
 bhaaiyo-bahanon, bhrashtachar mukt bharat ek bada ahm kaam he, usko ham bal dene kaa prayaas kar rahe he
 After the formation of the government, the first task was to create SIT
 aaj teen saal ke baad main deshavaasiyon ko bataanaa chahta hum, garv se bataanaa chahta hum ki teen saal ke bheetar-bheetar, kareeb-kareeb sava lakh karod rupye se bhi zyada kalaadhan ko hamane khoj diya he, usko pakadaa he or usko suurender karne ke liye majaboor kiya he
 After that we decided to demonetise
 notebandi ke dwaara hamane anek mahatvapurn safaltaaen praapt kii hai
 The black money that was hidden had to come into the mainstream
 aapane dekha hoga ki ham kabhi 07 din-10 din-15 din badhaate jate the, kabhi petrol pump par, kabhi dawaai kii dukaan par, kabhi railway stesan par puraane note lene kaa silsilaa jari rakhte the, kyonki hamaara prayaas tha ki ek baar jo bhi dhan aae wo bainkon main formal economy kaa hissaa ban jaae or us kaam ko hamane safaltaapurvak paar kiya he
 And the reason for this is that the research that has been done now, is about three lakh crore rupees
 
 
 ye sarkaar ne research nahin kii he, baahar ke expert ne kii he
 Three lakh crore rupees after demonetisation, the additional, which never came back in the banking system, has come
 bainkon main jamaa kii gai raashi main paune do lakh karod se adhik raashi shaq ke ghere main he
 At least two lakh crore rupees of black money has had to reach the banks and now they are forced to give their answers with the system
 nae kaledhan par bhi bahut badi rukaawat aa gai he
 This year, see the result, 56 lakhs of new individual taxpayers filing income tax returns from 01 April to 05 August 
 pichley saal usee avadhi main ye sankhya sirf 22 lakh thi
 More than double! These reasons are the result of our fight against black money
 18 lakh se zyada aise logon ko pahchaan liya gaya he, jinaki aay unke hisaab kitaab se kuch zyada he, beshumaar zyada he or isaliye is antar kaa unako jawaab dena pad rahaa he
 Out of this, four and a half lakh people have now come to the field, accepting their mistake and trying to get in the way
 ek lakh log aise saamne aae hai, jinhone kabhi jindagi main Income Tax kaa naam bhi nahin suna tha, na Income Tax kabhi diya tha, na kabhi unhone us par sochaa tha, lekin aaj unako wo karnaa pad rahaa he

 Then three lakh such companies have been found, which are just and shell companies only
 hawala kaa kaarobaar karti hai
 Three lakhs, one can imagine
 or usamen se paune do lakh kaa registration hamanen Cancel kar diya he
 If five companies are closed, then there is a storm in India
 paune do lakh companiyon ko taale laga diye
 Those who looted the goods of the country will have to answer, we did this by doing this
 aapako hairaani hogi! kuch to shell companiyaan aisi hai, jo ek hi Address par chaar sau chaar sau companiyaan chal rahi thim, bhaaiyon bahanon
 Four hundred and four hundred companies were operating
 koi dekhne vaala nahin tha, koi poochne vaala nahin tha
 All the collusion was going on
 or isaliye mere bhaaiyon bahanon, maine bhrashtachar kaale dhan ke khilaaf ek bahut badi ladaai chhedi he
 For the betterment of the country, for the welfare of the poor of the country, for the future of the youth of the country

 akele Transportation hamaara trek vaala ek sthaan se duusare sthaan par jaataa tha
 After this GST, thirty percent of his time is saved
 check-post khatm hone ke kaaran hajaaron karod rupayon kii to bachat hui he
 The biggest savings have been time

 You can imagine what it means to increase thirty percent efficiency in the transport world of India
 ek GST ke kaaran itnaa bada parivartan aayaa he
 My dear countrymen, today money has come to banks due to demonetisation
 bank apni byaaj dar kam kar rahe hai
 The common man is getting money from the bank through currency
 saamaanya maanav ko apane pairon par khadey hone ke liye avasar mil rahaa he
 Be poor, a middle class person wants to build a house, then banks are coming forward to help him, coming at a lower rate of interest

 My dear countrymen, now is the time

 And that's why we should go ahead with a low cash economy
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, sarkaar kii kuch yojanaayen aisi hai, jo hindustan ke saamaanya maanav kii jeb main paise bachaa saken
 If you put an LED bulb, then a thousand rupees two thousand five thousand rupees of the year are going to save you
 agar aap svachh bharat main safal hote hai, to garib kaa saat hajaar kaa rupaya dawaai kaa band hota he
 Controlling inflation has been successful in curbing your rising expenses, in a way your savings

 And that's why my dear countrymen, i request you to move ahead by taking a pledge for 'new India', and do it in time
 hamaare yahaan shastron main kaha gaya haih aniyat kaal:, aniyat kaalah prabhutayo viplavante, prabhutayo viplavante

 And therefore my dear countrymen, we will all try to work together in this race of development

 Speaking of cleanliness, even today, in every corner of India, some one is carrying forward the cleanliness drive
 jab notebandi kii baat ai, duniya ko aashcharya hua tha, yahaan tak log kah rahe the, ab modi gaya
 But the patience of the 125 crore countrymen who showed in demonetisation, the faith that they told and the result of that, today we are succeeding in taking steps against corruption

 ek lakh log aise saamne aae hai, jinhone kabhi jindagi main Income Tax kaa naam bhi nahin suna tha, na Income Tax kabhi diya tha, na kabhi unhone us par sochaa tha, lekin aaj unako wo karnaa pad rahaa he
 Brothers and sisters, if two or four companies are shut down in our country, then there are discussions on them round the clock

 Three lakhs, one can imagine

 If five companies are closed, then there is a storm in India

 Those who looted the goods of the country will have to answer, we did this by doing this
 aapako hairaani hogi! kuch to shell companiyaan aisi hai, jo ek hi Address par chaar sau chaar sau companiyaan chal rahi thim, bhaaiyon bahanon
 Four hundred and four hundred companies were operating

 All the collusion was going on
 or isaliye mere bhaaiyon bahanon, maine bhrashtachar kaale dhan ke khilaaf ek bahut badi ladaai chhedi he
 For the betterment of the country, for the welfare of the poor of the country, for the future of the youth of the country
 bhaaiyon bahanon, ek ke baad ek kadam or mujhe vishwaas he GST ke baad usamen or badhotaree hone vaali he
 And Transparency is forthcoming
 akele Transportation hamaara trek vaala ek sthaan se duusare sthaan par jaataa tha
 After this GST, thirty percent of his time is saved
 check-post khatm hone ke kaaran hajaaron karod rupayon kii to bachat hui he
 The biggest savings have been time
 ek prakaar se uski tees pratishat Efficiency bad rahi he
 You can imagine what it means to increase thirty percent efficiency in the transport world of India
 ek GST ke kaaran itnaa bada parivartan aayaa he
 My dear countrymen, today money has come to banks due to demonetisation
 bank apni byaaj dar kam kar rahe hai
 The common man is getting money from the bank through currency
 saamaanya maanav ko apane pairon par khadey hone ke liye avasar mil rahaa he
 Be poor, a middle class person wants to build a house, then banks are coming forward to help him, coming at a lower rate of interest
 ye sara desh ke arthtantr ko gati dene kii disha main kaam kar rahaa he
 My dear countrymen, now is the time

 We adopt BHIM APP, become part of economic business
 ham Prepaid ke dwaara bhi kaam karen
 And i am happy that Digital transactions have grown
 pichley saal ke mukaable usamen 34 pratishat kaa ijapha hua he or Prepaid bhugtan main kareeb 44 pratishat kaa
 And that's why we should go ahead with a low cash economy
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, sarkaar kii kuch yojanaayen aisi hai, jo hindustan ke saamaanya maanav kii jeb main paise bachaa saken
 If you put an LED bulb, then a thousand rupees two thousand five thousand rupees of the year are going to save you
 agar aap svachh bharat main safal hote hai, to garib kaa saat hajaar kaa rupaya dawaai kaa band hota he
 Controlling inflation has been successful in curbing your rising expenses, in a way your savings
 ‘jan aushadhi kendron’ ke dwaara sasti dawaai kii dukaan garib ke liye ek bahut bada aashirwad bani he
 The expenses that were behind our operation, behind the stent, have come down
 aane vaale dinon main Knee ke Operation ke liye bhi sari suvidhaayen milengi
 Our effort is to reduce these expenses for the poor and middle class human beings and for that we are taking steps one after the other
 pehle hamaare desh main rajyon ke mukhyalay main Dialysis hua karata tha
 We decided to deliver dialysis to the district centers of India
 kareeb saadhe teen sau, chaar sau jilon tak pahunchaa diya or muft main Dialysis karke garib kii jindagi bachaane kaa kaam ham kar rahe hai
 Today the country can be proud that we have developed our systems in front of the world

 The 'BHIM-AADHAR App' is a wonder within the world for Digital Transaction
 rupay Card 
 
 
 In India, rupay Card is worth crores
 or agar wo operational ho jayega, wo agar garibon ke jeb main he, to duniya kaa, ye sabase bada ho jayega
 And that's why my dear countrymen, i request you to move ahead by taking a pledge for 'new India', and do it in time
 hamaare yahaan shastron main kaha gaya haih aniyat kaal:, aniyat kaalah prabhutayo viplavante, prabhutayo viplavante
 If a task is not completed at the right time, then the desired result is never achieved
 or isaliye ‘team India’ ke liye, sava sau karod deshavaasiyon kii team India ke liye, aaj hamen sankalp lenaa hoga 2022 tak ‘new India’ banane kaa or ye kaam ham khud karenge, koi karegaa aisa nahin, ham khud karenge
 Will do for the country, will do better than before, will do more than before, will do it with dedication, in 2022 to see 'grand-divine' Hindustan

 Together we will create an India where youth and women will have ample opportunities to fulfill their dreams
 ham sab milakar ke ek aisa bharat banaaenge, jo aatankwaad sampradayawad or jatvaad se mukt hoga
 Together we will create an India where there will be no compromise on corruption and nepotism
 ham sab milakar ke ek aisa bharat banaaenge, jo svachh hoga, swasth hoga or swaraj ke sapane ko puraa karegaa
 And therefore my dear countrymen, we will all try to work together in this race of development
 aaj aazaadee ke 70 saal ke baad, aazaadee ke 75 saal kii pratiksha ke bich paanch saal ke mahatvapurn kaarykaal main ek ‘divya-bhavy bharat’ ke sapane ko lekar ke ham sabhi deshvasi chalem, isi ek bhav ke saath main phir ek baar aazaadee ke diwaanon ko pranaam karata hum

 saabhaar: PIB My dear countrymen, Lal Bahadur Shastri gave the mantra of Jai Jawan Jai Kisan
 hamaare desh ke kisaan ne peeche mud ke kabhi dekha nahin, record fasal utpaadan aaj hamaara kisaan karke de rahaa he
 In the midst of natural disasters, he is getting new achievements
 daal kaa record utpaadan hua he or mere pyaare bhaiyo bahanon, mere kisaan bhaiyo bahanon, hindustan main kabhi bhi sarkaar main daal kharidne kii parampara hi nahin rahi he or kabhi ek-aadh baar kiya ho to hajaaron main hi hajaaron ton ke hisaab ke hisaab se hota tha, is baar jab mere desh ke kisaanon ne daal utpaadan karke garib ko paushtik aahaar dene kaa kaam kiya, to 16 lakh ton daal, sarkaar ne kharidne kaa aitihaasik kaam karke is kaam ko badhaava diya
 Prime Minister Crop Insurance Scheme, a security shield has been provided to my farmer brothers
 teen saal pehle sirf sava teen karod kisaan is pradhanmantri fasal beemaa yojana, jo pehle duusare naam se chalati thi uskaa laabh lete the
 Today, in such a short time under the Prime Minister Crop Insurance Scheme, many new farmers have joined with it and almost these numbers have reached a further six crores
 pradhanmantri krishi sinchai yojana, kisaan ko agar pani mili to mitti main se sona paidaa karne kii takat rakhata he or isliye kisaan ko pani pahunchane ke liye maine pichhali baar lalakile se kaha tha, un yojaanaaon main se 21 yojana ham purna kar chuke hai or baaki 50 yojanaayen aane vaale kuch samay main purna ho jaaengi
 And i have resolved a total of 99 schemes
 2019 ke pehle un 99 badi-bady yojanaayen ko paripurna karke, kisaan ke khet tak pani pahunchane kaa kaam ham purna kar denge
 And we cannot change the fate of our farmer till we provide for the farmer from seed to market
 or isliye uske liye infrastructure chahie, uske liye supply-chain chahie
 Every year our vegetables, our fruits, our crops worth millions and billions are wasted and so to change that, one has encouraged Foreign Direct Investment so that the world can join us in food processing
 Infrastructure banane ke liye badhaava diya or bharat sarkaar ne ‘pradhanmantri kisaan sampada yojana’ lagu kii he
 Due to which arrangements will be made that will hand-hold the farmer from seed to market, develop systems and we will be successful in bringing a new change in the lives of our crores of farmers
 Demand or Technology ke kaaran, hamaare desh main nature of job main bhi bahut bada badlaav aa rahaa he
 In employment related schemes, according to the requirements of 21st century in the way of training, the Government of India has taken up many new schemes for the development of human resources
 naujavaanon ko bina guarantee bainkon se paisa mili iske liye bahut bada abhiyaan chalaaya he
 Our youth should stand on their feet, they should get employment, become employable, and in the last three years we have seen that due to 'pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana', crores of youth have stood on their feet
 itnaa hi nahin, ek noujvaan ek yaa do teen or logon ko bhi rojgaar de rahaa he
 To create World Class Universities in the field of education, we have taken a major step to break free from bondage
 20 uniwarsitiyon kaa aahvaan kiya he ki aap apane bhagya kaa faisla kiijie, sarkaar kahin bich main nahin aegi
 From above the government is also ready to help up to 1000 crores rupees
 aahvaan kiya he, mujhe vishwaas he mere desh kii shiksha sansthaaon main jarur aage aaenge, isko safal karenge
 In the last three years, 6 iits, 7 new iims, 8 new iiits have been built, and we have also done this work to link education with job opportunities
 meri maatayen, bahanen aaj bahut badi maatra main, parivaar main mahilaayein bhi rojgaar ke liye jaati hai
 And so at night, they get employment opportunities, work in factories, so have taken a very important step to change Labor Laws
 hamaari maatayen, bahanen parivaar kii bhi ek ahm ikai hai
 The contribution of our mothers and sisters is huge to build our future, and so Maternity Leave, which was 12 weeks, will continue to have income in 26 weeks, thus giving has worked
 main aaj hamaari mahilaon ke shashaktikaran ke kaam ke sambandh main, main khaas karke, main un bahanon kaa abhinandan karnaa chahta hum jo teen talaak ke kaaran bahut hi durdavy jindagi jeene ke liye majaboor hui hai
 There is no shelter left, and such afflicted, triple-divorced sisters have started a movement across the country
 desh ke buddhijivi varg ko hilaa diya, desh ke media ne bhi unki madad kii, puure desh main teen-talaak ke khilaaf ek maahaul nirmaan hua
 i heartily congratulate my sisters who are fighting this movement against the triple talaq, and i am sure that in helping them in their fight for the empowerment of mothers and sisters, Will do
 hindustan puri madad karegaa or Women Empowerment ke is mahatvapurn kadam main wo safal hoke rahegi; aisa mujhe puraa bharosa he
 My dear countrymen, sometimes in the name of faith, in the absence of patience some people do such things, which spoil the fabric of society
 desh shanti, sadbhaavna or ekta se chalata he
 The poison of casteism, the poison of communalism, can never benefit the country
 ye to gandhi kii bhoomi he, buddha kii bhoomi he, sabko saath le karke chalanaa; ye is desh kii samskruti or parampara kaa hissaa he
 We have to carry it forward successfully, and hence violence cannot be stressed in the name of faith
 aspataal main to patient ke saath kuch ho jaae, aspataal jala diya jaae; aksmaat ho jaae, gaadiyaan jala diya jaaen; andolan karen, sarkari sampatti ko jala diya jaae; aaazaad hindustan ke liye ye kiskaa he? hamaare sava sau karod deshavaasiyon kii sampatti he
 Whose cultural heritage is this? This is the cultural heritage of 1
25 billion countrymen
 ye aasthaa kiski he? ham sava sau karod deshavaasiyon kii aasthaa he; or isliye aasthaa ke naam par hinsa kaa rasta, is desh main kabhi bhi chal nahin saktaa, yah desh kabhi sweekaar nahin kar saktaa he
 And so i will urge the countrymen, at that time there was the slogan 'quit India', today the slogan is 'add India'
 vyakti-vyakti ko hamane saath lenaa he, jan-jan ko saath lenaa he, samaaj ke har tabake ko saath lenaa he, or usee ko le karke hamen desh ko aage badhanaa he
 We need a strong economy to build a prosperous India
 santulit vikaas chahie, next generation infrastructure chahie, tab ja kar ke hamaare sapanom ke bharat ko ham apni ankhon ke saamne dekh sakate hai
 Brothers and sisters, we have taken countless decisions in three years
 kuch chizon ko notice kiya gaya he or kuch chijen shaayad notice main nahin ai
 But one thing is important
 jab aap itnaa bada badlaav karte he to rukvaaten aati hai, gati ruk jaati he
 But see the working style of this government, if the train also passes near a railway station, when the track changes, the speed running from 60 has to be brought to the speed of 30
 trek badalane par train kii speed kam ho jaati he
 We are trying to take the whole country to a new track, but we have not let his speed down, we have kept his pace
 chaahe GST laaen ho, koi bhi kanoon laaen ho, koi bhi nai vyavastha laae ho, ham usko karne main safal hue he or aage bhi isko ham karenge
 We have laid emphasis on infrastructure
 abhootpurv kharch infrastructure par die ja rahe hai
 The railway station should be modernized, in a small town, whether to build an airport, whether to arrange water-way, whether to arrange roadways, whether to build gas grid, whether to grid water, whether to do optical fiber network , We are giving full emphasis on all types of modern infrastructure
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, 21veen sadi main bharat ko aage badhaane kaa sabase urjavan kshetra he, hamaara purvi hindustan
 There is so much potential, powerful human resource, immense natural wealth, rich of hard work, and ability to change life by resolving
 hamaara puraa dhyaan purvi uttar pradesh, bihar, bengal, assam, north east, odisha, ye hamaare aise samarthyavan rajya hai, jahaan prakritik sampada bharpoor he, usko aage badhaakar ke desh ko ek nai oonchai par le jane kii disha main ham prayatnrat he
 Brothers and sisters, corruption-free India is a very important task, we are trying to strengthen it
 sarkaar banane ke baad pehla kaam kiya tha SIT banane kaa
 Today, after three years, i want to tell the countrymen, proudly tell them that within three years, we have discovered more than about 1
25 lakh crore rupees of black money, caught it and suurender it
 Is forced
 uske baad hamane notebandi kaa faisla kiya
 We have achieved many significant successes through demonetisation
 jo kalaadhan chipa hua tha, usko mukhyadhara main aana padaa
 You must have seen that we sometimes used to extend 07 days-10 days-15 days, sometimes at the petrol pump, sometimes at the drugstore, sometimes at the railway station, we continued to take old notes, because our effort was once Money should also become a part of the formal economy in the banks and we have successfully completed that work
 or iskaa kaaran yah hua he ki abhi jo research hua he, kareeb teen lakh karod rupye
 
 
 This government has not done research, outside experts have done it
 notebandi ke baad teen lakh karod rupye, jo atirikt, jo kabhi banking system main waapas nahin aata tha wo aayaa he
 More than a quarter of a million rupees in the amount deposited in banks is under suspicion
 kam se kam do lakh karod rupye se zyada kalaadhan usko bainko tak pahunchnaa padaa he or ab vyavastha ke saath unako apana jawaab dene ke liye majaboor hue hai
 The new black money has also come to a great halt
 is varsh, iskaa parinaam dekhie, 01 april se 05 agast tak income tax return daakhil karne vaale nae vyaktigat karadaataaon kii sankhya 56 lakh
 In the same period last year, this number was only 2
2 million
 Double se bhi zyada! ye kaaran kaledhan ke khilaaf hamaari ladaai kaa parinaam he
 More than 18 lakh people have been identified, whose income is more than the book according to them, they are uncountable and hence they have to answer this difference
 saadhe chaar lakh log isamen se ab maidan main aaye hai, apni galati sweekaar karke raste main aane kaa prayaas kar rahe hai
 One lakh people have come forward, who had never heard of income tax in life, nor had ever given income tax, nor had they thought of it, but today they have to do it
 bhaaiyon bahanon, hamaare desh main agar do chaar companiyaan bhi kahin band ho jaae, to choubison ghante us par charchaaen hoti hai us par Debates hoti hai
 Economy is over


 it is done, no matter what happens! You'd be surprised to know, black money traders, Shell used to run companies and after demonetisation when data-mining was done
 tab teen lakh aisi companiyaan pai gayi hai, jo sirf or sirf shell companiyaan hai
 Does hawala business
 teen lakh, koi kalpana kar saktaa he
 And we have canceled the registration of one and a half lakh from that
 paanch companiyaan band ho jaae to hindustan main tufaan much jaataa he
 Locked up to twenty two lakh companies
 desh kaa maal luutane waalon ko jawaab dena padegaa, ye kaam hamane kar ke dikhaaya
 You will be surprised! Some shell companies are such that four hundred and four hundred companies were running at the same address, brothers and sisters
 chaar sau chaar sau companiyaan chal rahi thim
 Nobody was going to see, nobody was going to ask
 sari mileebhagat chal rahi thi
 And so my brothers and sisters, i have waged a very big fight against corruption black money
 desh kii bhalaai ke liye desh ke garibon ke kalyaan ke liye, desh ke naujavaanon ke bhavishya ko banane ke liye
 Brothers and sisters, one step after the other, and i am sure it will increase further after GST
 or Transparency aane vaali he
 Transportation alone Our truck used to go from one place to another
 ye GST ke baad tees pratishat uskaa samay batch gaya he
 Thousands of crores of rupees have been saved due to the end of check-post
 sabase badi bachat samay kii hui he
 In a way, its thirty percent efficiency is increasing
 aap kalpana kar sakate hai hindustan ke Transport jagat main tees pratishat Efficiency badhane kaa matlab kya hota he
 a GST has brought about such a big change
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, aaj notebandi ke kaaran bainko ke paas dhan aayaa he
 Banks are reducing their interest rate
 mudra ke dwaara saamaanya maanav ko bank se paisa mil rahaa he
 The common man is getting an opportunity to stand on his feet
 garib ho, madhyavarg kaa vyakti ho ghar bananaa chahta he, to bank usko madad karne ke liye aage aa rahe hai, kam byaaj kii dar se aage aa rahe hai
 It is working towards accelerating the economy of the country
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, ab ye vakt badal chukaa he
 We are in the 21st century
 vishwa kaa sabase bada yuva varg hamaare desh main he
 Our identity in the world is by IT, by Digital World
 kya ab bhi ham usee pooraani soch main rahenge
 Hey! Once upon a time, leather coins used to move, slowly disappeared, no one was asking
 aaj jo kaagaj ke note hai, samay aate rahete wo sara kaa sara Digital Currency main Convert hone vaala he
 Let us lead, let us take responsibility, let us go towards Digital Transaction
 ham BHIM APP ko apanaaen, aarthik kaarobaar kaa hissaa banaaen
 We also work through Prepaid
 or mujhe khushi he ki Digital lenden badi he
 It has increased by 34 percent over the previous year and about 44 percent in prepaid payments
 or isaliye kam cash vaali arthvyavastha, usko lekar ke hamen aage badhanaa chahie
 My dear countrymen, there are some schemes of the government that can save money in the pockets of the common man of India
 agar aap LED Bulb lagaate hai, to saal bhar kaa hajaar do hajaar paanch hajaar rupaya aapkaa bachane vaala he
 If you succeed in a clean India, then the poor's medicine of seven thousand rupees stops
 mahangaai par niyantran, aapke badhate hue kharch ko rokane main safal hua he, ek prakaar se aapaki bachat he
 Affordable medicine shops have become a huge blessing for the poor through 'jan Aushadhi Kendras'
 hamaare yahaan Operation ke peeche, stent ke peeche jo kharch hote the wo kam hue hai
 In the coming days, all facilities will also be available for Knee's operation
 hamaari koshish he ki garib or madhyamvarg ke maanav ke liye ye kharch kam ho or uske liye ham ek ke baad ek kadam uthaa rahe hai
 Earlier, dialysis used to take place in the headquarters of the states in our country
 hamane tay kiya hindustan ke jila kendron tak Dialysis pahunchaayenge
 Nearly three and a half hundred and four hundred districts have been reached and by dialysis for free, we are working to save the life of the poor
 aaj desh garv kar saktaa he ki hamane vishwa ke saamne apni vyavasthaaon ko viksit kiya he
 Today we have succeeded in arranging NAVIC Navigation through GPS System
 hamane SAARC Satellite ke dwaara hamane padosi deshon ke saath madad karne kaa safal abhiyaan kiya he
 We are delivering our importance inside the world today by 'tejas' airplane
 ‘BHIM-AADHAR App’ duniya ke andar Digital Transaction ke liye ek ajooba bana hua he
 rupay Card
 
 
 hindustan main rupay Card karodon kii taadaad main he
 And if it becomes operational, if it is in the pocket of the poor, then it will become the largest in the world
 or isaliye mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, meraa aapse yahi aagrah he ki ham ‘new India’ kaa sankalp le kar ke aage badhen, samay rahete hue karen
 It is said in our scriptures: Aniyat Kaal: Aniyat Kaal: Prabhutyo Viplavante, Prabhutayo Viplavante
 sahi samay par agar koi kaary puraa nahin kiya gaya, to phir icchit parinaam kabhi nahin milte hai
 And so for 'team India', for Team India of 1
25 billion countrymen, today we have to pledge to make 'new India' by 2022 and we will do this work ourselves, no one will do it, we will do it ourselves
 desh ke liye karenge, pehle se acha karenge, pehle se zyada karenge, samarpan bhav se karenge, 2022 main ‘bhavy-divya’ hindustan dekhne ke liye karenge
 And that's why we will all together create an India where the poor have a pucca house, electricity, water
 ham sab milakar ek aisa bharat banaaenge, jahaan desh kaa kisaan chintaa main nahin chaiyn se soyega
 By 2022, he will earn twice as much as he is earning today
 ham sab milakar ke ek aisa hindustan banaaenge, jahaan yuvaaon, mahilaon ko apane sapane puure karne ke liye bharpoor avasar uplabdh honge
 Together we will create an India that will be free from terrorism, communalism and casteism
 ham sab milakar ke ek aisa bharat banaaenge, jahaan bhrashtachar or bhai-bhatijawad se koi samjhauta nahin hoga
 Together we will create an India that will be clean, healthy and fulfill the dream of Swaraj
 or isaliye mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, ham sab milakar ke vikaas kii is daud main aage chalane kaa prayaas karenge
 Today, after 70 years of independence, in the midst of waiting for 75 years of independence, in the important tenure of five years, all of us countrymen should go with the dream of a 'divine-grand India', with this same sentiment i once again i bow to the crazy people
 sava sau karod deshavaasiyon ke nae vishwaas, nai umang ko naman karata hum
 And call upon 'team India' to move forward with a new resolution
 isi bhaavana ke saath aap sabko hriday se meri bahut bahut shubhakamanaayen

 The comments sabhi kaa bahut bahut dhanyavad
 Sincerely: PIB pradhanmantri fasal beemaa yojana, ek suraksha kavach mere kisaan bhaiyon ko mila he
 Three years ago, only 1
25 crore farmers used to take advantage of this Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, which was earlier known by another name
 aaj pradhanmantri fasal beemaa yojana main itane kam samay main kai naye kisaan iske saath jud gaye hai or kareeb-kareeb ye sankhya aage chalakar ke paune chah karod par pahunchi he
 The Prime Minister Agricultural Irrigation Scheme, if the farmer gets water, has the power to produce gold from the soil and so to provide water to the farmer last time i told the Red Fort, we have completed 21 of those schemes and the rest 50 plans will be completed in the coming time
 or total 99 yojanaon kaa maine sankalp liya he
 We will complete the water supply to the farmer's farm by completing those 99 big plans before 2019
 or kisaan ko beej se bazaar tak, jab tak ham vyastha nahin dete hai, hamaare kisaan ke bhagya ko ham nahin badal sakate hai
 And therefore it needs infrastructure, it needs supply-chain
 har saal lakhon-karodon rupayon kii hamaari sabji, hamaare fal, hamaari fasal barbaad ho jaati he or isliye usko badalane ke liye ek to Foreign Direct Investment ko badhaava diya taaki food processing ke andar duniya hamaare saath jude
 Promoted to create infrastructure and Government of India has implemented 'pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojana'
 jiske kaaran un vyavasthaaon kaa nirmaan kiya jayega jo beej se bazaar tak kisaan ko hand-holding karenge, vyavasthaaen viksit karenge or hamaare karodon kisaanon kii jindagi main ek nayaa badlaav laane main ham safal honge
 Due to Demand and Technology, the nature of job is also changing in our country
 rojgaar se judi yojanaon main, training ke tareeke main 21veen sadi kii aavashyaktaaon ke anusaar, maanav sansaadhan ke vikaas ke liye bharat sarkaar ne anek nai yojanaayen haath main lee hai
 a huge campaign has been launched to ensure that the youth get money from banks without guarantee
 hamaara noujvaan apane pairon par khadaa ho, wo rojgaar paane vaala rahe, rojgaar dene vaala bane, or pichley teen saal main dekha he ki ‘pradhanmantri mudra yojana’ ke kaaran karodon noujvaan apane pairon par khadey hue hai
 Not only this, a young man is also employing one or two to three more people
 shiksha ke kshetra main World Class Universities banane ke liye hamane bandhanon se mukti dene kaa ek bada ahm kadam uthaaya he
 20 Universities have been called upon to decide their fate, Government will not come anywhere
 upar se sarkaar 1000 karod rupee tak kii madad karne ke liye bhi taiyaar he
 Has given a call, i am sure the educational institutions of my country will definitely come forward and make it successful
 pichley teen varsh main 6 IIT, 7 nae IIM, 8 nae IIIT, iskaa nirmaan kiya he or shiksha ko naukari ke avasaron ke saath jodne kaa bhi is ko kaam hamane kiya he
 My mothers, sisters, today, in large quantities, women in the family also go for employment
 or isliye raatri ko bhi unako rojgaar kaa avasar mili, factoriyon main kaam karne kaa avasar mili, isliye Labour Laws main parivartan karne kaa bahut bada ahm kadam uthaaya he
 Our mothers and sisters are also an important unit of the family
 hamaara bhavishya nirmaan karne ke liye hamaari maataaon, bahanon kaa yogadan bahut bada hota he, or isliye Maternity Leave jo 12 saptaah kii thi, wo 26 saptaah, usamen aay chaalu rahegi, is prakaar se dene kaa kaam kiya he
 With regard to the work of empowerment of our women today, in particular, i would like to congratulate the sisters who have been forced to live a very difficult life due to triple talaq
 koi aashray nahin bachaa he, or aisi peedit, teen-talaak se peedit bahanon ne puure desh main ek andolan khadaa kiya he
 The intellectual class of the country was shaken, the media of the country also helped them, an atmosphere was created against triple talaq in the whole country
 is andolan ko chalaane vaali un meri bahanon ko, jo teen-talaak ke khilaaf ladai lard rahi hai, main hriday se unka abhindann karata hum or mujhe vishwaas he, ki maataaon-bahanon ko adhikaar dilaane main, unki is ladaai main hindustan unki puri madad karegaa
 Hindustan will help and it will be successful in this important step of Women Empowerment; i am sure of this
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyo, kabhi-kabhi aasthaa ke naam par dhairya ke abhaav main kuch log aisi chijen kar baithte hai, jo samaaj ke taane-bane ko bikher detii hai
 The country operates with peace, goodwill and unity
 jatvaad kaa jehar, sampradayawad kaa jehar, desh kaa kabhi bhala nahin kar saktaa he
 This is Gandhi's land, Buddha's land, take everyone along and walk; It is part of the culture and tradition of this country
 hamen isko safalataa se aage badhanaa he, or isliye aasthaa ke naam par hinsa ko bal nahin diya ja saktaa he
 If something happens to the patient in the hospital, the hospital is burnt; Accidentally, carts should be burnt; Move, government property be burned; Whose is this for Azad Hindustan? We have assets of 1
25 billion countrymen
 ye saanskrithik viraasat kiski he? ye ham sava sau karod deshavaasiyon kii saanskrithik viraasat he
 Whose faith is this? We are the faith of 125 crore countrymen; And so the path of violence in the name of faith can never go on in this country, this country can never accept
 or isliye main deshavaasiyon se aagrah karuunga, us samay ‘bharat chodo’ kaa naaraa tha, aaj naaraa he ‘bharat jodo’
 We have to take person-to-person, take people-to-people, we have to take every section of the society together, and we have to take the country forward by taking the same
 samrudh bharat banane ke liye hamaari majboot arthvyavastha chahie
 We need balanced development, next generation infrastructure, then we can see the India of our dreams in front of our eyes
 bhaaiyo-bahanon, anginat nirnay hamane teen saal main liye
 Some things have been noted and some things may not have come into notice
 lekin ek baat mahatvapurn he
 When you make such a big change, the stops come, the speed stops
 lekin is sarkaar kii kaaryastylee dekhie, agar train bhi kisi railway stesan ke paas se guzarati he, jab trek badalati he to 60 se chalane vaali speed ko usko 30 kii speed main laana padataa he
 The speed of the train decreases by changing the track
 ham puure desh ko ek nae trek par le jane kaa prayaas kar rahe hai, lekin hamane uski speed kam nahin hone di he, hamane uski gati ko barkaraar rakhaa he
 Whether we bring GST, any law, any new system, we have succeeded in doing that and we will do it in future
 hamane infrastructure par bal diya he
 Unprecedented expenses are being given on infrastructure
 railway stesan kaa aadhunikeekaran ho, chote shahar main, chaahe airport bananaa ho, chaahe water-way kii vyavastha kerani ho, chaahe roadways kii vyavastha kerani ho, chaahe gas grid banani ho, chaahe pani kii grid karaani ho, chaahe optical fibre network karnaa ho, har prakaar ke aadhunik infrastructure par ham purna bal de rahe hai
 My dear countrymen, our eastern India is the most energetic field to advance India in the 21st century
 itnaa potential he, samarthyavan maanav sansaadhan he, apaar prakritik sampada he, parishram ke dhani hai, sankalp karke jindagi badalane kaa samarthy rakhte hai
 Our entire focus is on eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Bengal, Assam, North East, Odisha, these are our powerful states, where natural wealth is abundant, we are trying to take the country to a new height by taking it forward
 bhaaiyo-bahanon, bhrashtachar mukt bharat ek bada ahm kaam he, usko ham bal dene kaa prayaas kar rahe he
 After the formation of the government, the first task was to create SIT
 aaj teen saal ke baad main deshavaasiyon ko bataanaa chahta hum, garv se bataanaa chahta hum ki teen saal ke bheetar-bheetar, kareeb-kareeb sava lakh karod rupye se bhi zyada kalaadhan ko hamane khoj diya he, usko pakadaa he or usko suurender karne ke liye majaboor kiya he
 After that we decided to demonetise
 notebandi ke dwaara hamane anek mahatvapurn safaltaaen praapt kii hai
 The black money that was hidden had to come into the mainstream
 aapane dekha hoga ki ham kabhi 07 din-10 din-15 din badhaate jate the, kabhi petrol pump par, kabhi dawaai kii dukaan par, kabhi railway stesan par puraane note lene kaa silsilaa jari rakhte the, kyonki hamaara prayaas tha ki ek baar jo bhi dhan aae wo bainkon main formal economy kaa hissaa ban jaae or us kaam ko hamane safaltaapurvak paar kiya he
 And the reason for this is that the research that has been done now, is about three lakh crore rupees
 
 
 ye sarkaar ne research nahin kii he, baahar ke expert ne kii he
 Three lakh crore rupees after demonetisation, the additional, which never came back in the banking system, has come
 bainkon main jamaa kii gai raashi main paune do lakh karod se adhik raashi shaq ke ghere main he
 At least two lakh crore rupees of black money has had to reach the banks and now they are forced to give their answers with the system
 nae kaledhan par bhi bahut badi rukaawat aa gai he
 This year, see the result, 56 lakh new taxpayers filing income tax returns from 01 April to 05 August
 pichley saal usee avadhi main ye sankhya sirf 22 lakh thi
 More than double! These reasons are the result of our fight against black money
 18 lakh se zyada aise logon ko pahchaan liya gaya he, jinaki aay unke hisaab kitaab se kuch zyada he, beshumaar zyada he or isaliye is antar kaa unako jawaab dena pad rahaa he
 Out of this, four and a half lakh people have now come to the field, accepting their mistake and trying to get in the way
 ek lakh log aise saamne aae hai, jinhone kabhi jindagi main Income Tax kaa naam bhi nahin suna tha, na Income Tax kabhi diya tha, na kabhi unhone us par sochaa tha, lekin aaj unako wo karnaa pad rahaa he
 Brothers and sisters, if two or four companies are shut down in our country, then there are discussions on them round the clock
 arthniti khatm ho gai


 ye ho gaya, na jane kya kya hota he! aapako jaanakar ke hairaani hogi, kaale dhan ke kaarobaari, Shell companiyaan chalaate the or notebandi ke baad jab data-mining kiya gaya
 Then three lakh such companies have been found, which are just and shell companies only
 hawala kaa kaarobaar karti hai
 Three lakhs, one can imagine
 or usamen se paune do lakh kaa registration hamanen Cancel kar diya he
 If five companies are closed, then there is a storm in India
 paune do lakh companiyon ko taale laga diye
 Those who looted the goods of the country will have to answer, we did this by doing this
 aapako hairaani hogi! kuch to shell companiyaan aisi hai, jo ek hi Address par chaar sau chaar sau companiyaan chal rahi thim, bhaaiyon bahanon
 Four hundred and four hundred companies were operating
 koi dekhne vaala nahin tha, koi poochne vaala nahin tha
 All the collusion was going on
 or isaliye mere bhaaiyon bahanon, maine bhrashtachar kaale dhan ke khilaaf ek bahut badi ladaai chhedi he
 For the betterment of the country, for the welfare of the poor of the country, for the future of the youth of the country
 bhaaiyon bahanon, ek ke baad ek kadam or mujhe vishwaas he GST ke baad usamen or badhotaree hone vaali he
 And Transparency is forthcoming
 akele Transportation hamaara trek vaala ek sthaan se duusare sthaan par jaataa tha
 After this GST, thirty percent of his time is saved
 check-post khatm hone ke kaaran hajaaron karod rupayon kii to bachat hui he
 The biggest savings have been time
 ek prakaar se uski tees pratishat Efficiency bad rahi he
 You can imagine what it means to increase thirty percent efficiency in the transport world of India
 ek GST ke kaaran itnaa bada parivartan aayaa he
 My dear countrymen, today money has come to banks due to demonetisation
 bank apni byaaj dar kam kar rahe hai
 The common man is getting money from the bank through currency
 saamaanya maanav ko apane pairon par khadey hone ke liye avasar mil rahaa he
 Be poor, a middle class person wants to build a house, then banks are coming forward to help him, coming at a lower rate of interest
 ye sara desh ke arthtantr ko gati dene kii disha main kaam kar rahaa he
 My dear countrymen, now is the time
 ham 21veen sadi main hai
 The largest youth group in the world is in our country
 duniya main hamaari pahchaan IT ke dwaara he, Digital World ke dwaara he
 Will we still remain in the same old thinking? are! ek jamaane main chamade ke sikke chalate the, dhire-dhire lupt ho gaye, koi poochne vaala nahin rahaa
 Today the paper notes are going to be converted into digital currency all the time
 ham netritv karen, ham jimmevary len, ham Digital Transaction kii ore jaaen
 We adopt BHIM APP, become part of economic business
 ham Prepaid ke dwaara bhi kaam karen
 And i am happy that Digital transactions have grown
 pichley saal ke mukaable usamen 34 pratishat kaa ijapha hua he or Prepaid bhugtan main kareeb 44 pratishat kaa
 And that's why we should go ahead with a low cash economy
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, sarkaar kii kuch yojanaayen aisi hai, jo hindustan ke saamaanya maanav kii jeb main paise bachaa saken
 If you put an LED bulb, then a thousand rupees two thousand five thousand rupees of the year are going to save you
 agar aap svachh bharat main safal hote hai, to garib kaa saat hajaar kaa rupaya dawaai kaa band hota he
 Controlling inflation has been successful in curbing your rising expenses, in a way your savings
 ‘jan aushadhi kendron’ ke dwaara sasti dawaai kii dukaan garib ke liye ek bahut bada aashirwad bani he
 The expenses that were behind our operation, behind the stent, have come down
 aane vaale dinon main Knee ke Operation ke liye bhi sari suvidhaayen milengi
 Our effort is to reduce these expenses for the poor and middle class human beings and for that we are taking steps one after the other
 pehle hamaare desh main rajyon ke mukhyalay main Dialysis hua karata tha
 We decided to deliver dialysis to the district centers of India
 kareeb saadhe teen sau, chaar sau jilon tak pahunchaa diya or muft main Dialysis karke garib kii jindagi bachaane kaa kaam ham kar rahe hai
 Today the country can be proud that we have developed our systems in front of the world
 GPS System ke dwaara NAVIC Navigation kii vyavastha aaj karne main ham safal hue hai
 Through SAARC Satellite, we have successfully campaigned to help with neighboring countries
 ham ‘tejas’ hawaii jahaaj ke dwaara aaj duniya ke andar apni ahmiyat pahunchaa rahe hai
 The 'BHIM-AADHAR App' is a wonder within the world for Digital Transaction
 rupay Card 
 
 
 In India, rupay Card is worth crores
 or agar wo operational ho jayega, wo agar garibon ke jeb main he, to duniya kaa, ye sabase bada ho jayega
 And that's why my dear countrymen, i request you to move ahead by taking a pledge for 'new India', and do it in time
 hamaare yahaan shastron main kaha gaya haih aniyat kaal:, aniyat kaalah prabhutayo viplavante, prabhutayo viplavante
 If a task is not completed at the right time, then the desired result is never achieved
 or isaliye ‘team India’ ke liye, sava sau karod deshavaasiyon kii team India ke liye, aaj hamen sankalp lenaa hoga 2022 tak ‘new India’ banane kaa or ye kaam ham khud karenge, koi karegaa aisa nahin, ham khud karenge
 Will do for the country, will do better than before, will do more than before, will do it with dedication, in 2022 to see 'grand-divine' Hindustan
 or isaliye ham sab milakar ke ek aisa bharat banaaenge jahaan garib ke paas pakkaa ghar ho, bijli ho, pani ho
 Together we will create an India where the farmer of the country will sleep peacefully
 aaj wo jitna kama rahaa he, usase 2022 tak doguna kamayega
 Together we will create an India where youth and women will have ample opportunities to fulfill their dreams
 ham sab milakar ke ek aisa bharat banaaenge, jo aatankwaad sampradayawad or jatvaad se mukt hoga
 Together we will create an India where there will be no compromise on corruption and nepotism
 ham sab milakar ke ek aisa bharat banaaenge, jo svachh hoga, swasth hoga or swaraj ke sapane ko puraa karegaa
 And therefore my dear countrymen, we will all try to work together in this race of development
 aaj aazaadee ke 70 saal ke baad, aazaadee ke 75 saal kii pratiksha ke bich paanch saal ke mahatvapurn kaarykaal main ek ‘divya-bhavy bharat’ ke sapane ko lekar ke ham sabhi deshvasi chalem, isi ek bhav ke saath main phir ek baar aazaadee ke diwaanon ko pranaam karata hum
 i salute the new faith, new zeal of 1
25 billion countrymen
 or nae sankalp ke saath aage chalane ke liye ‘team India’ ko aahvaan karata hum
 With this feeling, my heartiest greetings to all of you
 bharat mata kii jai, vande maataram jai hind

 tippaniyan Thank you very much to all
 saabhaar: PIB The Prime Minister Agricultural Irrigation Scheme, if the farmer gets water, has the power to produce gold from the soil and so to provide water to the farmer last time i told the Red Fort, we have completed 21 of those schemes and the rest 50 plans will be completed in the coming time
 or total 99 yojanaon kaa maine sankalp liya he
 We will complete the water supply to the farmer's farm by completing those 99 big plans before 2019
 or kisaan ko beej se bazaar tak, jab tak ham vyastha nahin dete hai, hamaare kisaan ke bhagya ko ham nahin badal sakate hai
 And therefore it needs infrastructure, it needs supply-chain
 har saal lakhon-karodon rupayon kii hamaari sabji, hamaare fal, hamaari fasal barbaad ho jaati he or isliye usko badalane ke liye ek to Foreign Direct Investment ko badhaava diya taaki food processing ke andar duniya hamaare saath jude
 Promoted to create infrastructure and Government of India has implemented 'pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojana'
 jiske kaaran un vyavasthaaon kaa nirmaan kiya jayega jo beej se bazaar tak kisaan ko hand-holding karenge, vyavasthaaen viksit karenge or hamaare karodon kisaanon kii jindagi main ek nayaa badlaav laane main ham safal honge
 Due to Demand and Technology, the nature of job is also changing in our country
 rojgaar se judi yojanaon main, training ke tareeke main 21veen sadi kii aavashyaktaaon ke anusaar, maanav sansaadhan ke vikaas ke liye bharat sarkaar ne anek nai yojanaayen haath main lee hai
 a huge campaign has been launched to ensure that the youth get money from banks without guarantee
 hamaara noujvaan apane pairon par khadaa ho, wo rojgaar paane vaala rahe, rojgaar dene vaala bane, or pichley teen saal main dekha he ki ‘pradhanmantri mudra yojana’ ke kaaran karodon noujvaan apane pairon par khadey hue hai
 Not only this, a young man is also employing one or two to three more people
 shiksha ke kshetra main World Class Universities banane ke liye hamane bandhanon se mukti dene kaa ek bada ahm kadam uthaaya he
 20 Universities have been called upon to decide their fate, Government will not come anywhere
 upar se sarkaar 1000 karod rupee tak kii madad karne ke liye bhi taiyaar he
 Has given a call, i am sure the educational institutions of my country will definitely come forward and make it successful
 pichley teen varsh main 6 IIT, 7 nae IIM, 8 nae IIIT, iskaa nirmaan kiya he or shiksha ko naukari ke avasaron ke saath jodne kaa bhi is ko kaam hamane kiya he
 My mothers, sisters, today, in large quantities, women in the family also go for employment
 or isliye raatri ko bhi unako rojgaar kaa avasar mili, factoriyon main kaam karne kaa avasar mili, isliye Labour Laws main parivartan karne kaa bahut bada ahm kadam uthaaya he
 Our mothers and sisters are also an important unit of the family
 hamaara bhavishya nirmaan karne ke liye hamaari maataaon, bahanon kaa yogadan bahut bada hota he, or isliye Maternity Leave jo 12 saptaah kii thi, wo 26 saptaah, usamen aay chaalu rahegi, is prakaar se dene kaa kaam kiya he
 With regard to the work of empowerment of our women today, in particular, i would like to congratulate the sisters who have been forced to live a very difficult life due to triple talaq

 Hindustan will help and it will be successful in this important step of Women Empowerment; i am sure of this
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyo, kabhi-kabhi aasthaa ke naam par dhairya ke abhaav main kuch log aisi chijen kar baithte hai, jo samaaj ke taane-bane ko bikher detii hai
 The country operates with peace, goodwill and unity
 jatvaad kaa jehar, sampradayawad kaa jehar, desh kaa kabhi bhala nahin kar saktaa he
 This is Gandhi's land, Buddha's land, take everyone along and walk; It is part of the culture and tradition of this country

 We have to take person-to-person, take people-to-people, we have to take every section of the society together, and we have to take the country forward by taking the same

 Due to Demand and Technology, the nature of job is also changing in our country

 Has given a call, i am sure the educational institutions of my country will definitely come forward and make it successful
 pichley teen varsh main 6 IIT, 7 nae IIM, 8 nae IIIT, iskaa nirmaan kiya he or shiksha ko naukari ke avasaron ke saath jodne kaa bhi is ko kaam hamane kiya he
 My mothers, sisters, today, in large quantities, women in the family also go for employment
 or isliye raatri ko bhi unako rojgaar kaa avasar mili, factoriyon main kaam karne kaa avasar mili, isliye Labour Laws main parivartan karne kaa bahut bada ahm kadam uthaaya he
 Our mothers and sisters are also an important unit of the family
 hamaara bhavishya nirmaan karne ke liye hamaari maataaon, bahanon kaa yogadan bahut bada hota he, or isliye Maternity Leave jo 12 saptaah kii thi, wo 26 saptaah, usamen aay chaalu rahegi, is prakaar se dene kaa kaam kiya he
 With regard to the work of empowerment of our women today, in particular, i would like to congratulate the sisters who have been forced to live a very difficult life due to triple talaq
 koi aashray nahin bachaa he, or aisi peedit, teen-talaak se peedit bahanon ne puure desh main ek andolan khadaa kiya he
 The intellectual class of the country was shaken, the media of the country also helped them, an atmosphere was created against triple talaq in the whole country
 is andolan ko chalaane vaali un meri bahanon ko, jo teen-talaak ke khilaaf ladai lard rahi hai, main hriday se unka abhindann karata hum or mujhe vishwaas he, ki maataaon-bahanon ko adhikaar dilaane main, unki is ladaai main hindustan unki puri madad karegaa
 Hindustan will help and it will be successful in this important step of Women Empowerment; i am sure of this
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyo, kabhi-kabhi aasthaa ke naam par dhairya ke abhaav main kuch log aisi chijen kar baithte hai, jo samaaj ke taane-bane ko bikher detii hai
 The country operates with peace, goodwill and unity
 jatvaad kaa jehar, sampradayawad kaa jehar, desh kaa kabhi bhala nahin kar saktaa he
 This is Gandhi's land, Buddha's land, take everyone along and walk; It is part of the culture and tradition of this country
 hamen isko safalataa se aage badhanaa he, or isliye aasthaa ke naam par hinsa ko bal nahin diya ja saktaa he
 If something happens to the patient in the hospital, the hospital is burnt; Accidentally, carts should be burnt; Move, government property be burned; Whose is this for Azad Hindustan? We have assets of 1
25 billion countrymen
 ye saanskrithik viraasat kiski he? ye ham sava sau karod deshavaasiyon kii saanskrithik viraasat he
 Whose faith is this? We are the faith of 125 crore countrymen; And so the path of violence in the name of faith can never go on in this country, this country can never accept
 or isliye main deshavaasiyon se aagrah karuunga, us samay ‘bharat chodo’ kaa naaraa tha, aaj naaraa he ‘bharat jodo’
 We have to take person-to-person, take people-to-people, we have to take every section of the society together, and we have to take the country forward by taking the same
 samrudh bharat banane ke liye hamaari majboot arthvyavastha chahie
 We need balanced development, next generation infrastructure, then we can see the India of our dreams in front of our eyes
 bhaaiyo-bahanon, anginat nirnay hamane teen saal main liye
 Some things have been noted and some things may not have come into notice
 lekin ek baat mahatvapurn he
 When you make such a big change, the stops come, the speed stops
 lekin is sarkaar kii kaaryastylee dekhie, agar train bhi kisi railway stesan ke paas se guzarati he, jab trek badalati he to 60 se chalane vaali speed ko usko 30 kii speed main laana padataa he
 The speed of the train decreases by changing the track
 ham puure desh ko ek nae trek par le jane kaa prayaas kar rahe hai, lekin hamane uski speed kam nahin hone di he, hamane uski gati ko barkaraar rakhaa he
 Whether we bring GST, any law, any new system, we have succeeded in doing that and we will do it in future
 hamane infrastructure par bal diya he
 Unprecedented expenses are being given on infrastructure
 railway stesan kaa aadhunikeekaran ho, chote shahar main, chaahe airport bananaa ho, chaahe water-way kii vyavastha kerani ho, chaahe roadways kii vyavastha kerani ho, chaahe gas grid banani ho, chaahe pani kii grid karaani ho, chaahe optical fibre network karnaa ho, har prakaar ke aadhunik infrastructure par ham purna bal de rahe hai
 My dear countrymen, our eastern India is the most energetic field to advance India in the 21st century
 itnaa potential he, samarthyavan maanav sansaadhan he, apaar prakritik sampada he, parishram ke dhani hai, sankalp karke jindagi badalane kaa samarthy rakhte hai
 Our entire focus is on eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Bengal, Assam, North East, Odisha, these are our powerful states, where natural wealth is abundant, we are trying to take the country to a new height by taking it forward
 bhaaiyo-bahanon, bhrashtachar mukt bharat ek bada ahm kaam he, usko ham bal dene kaa prayaas kar rahe he
 After the formation of the government, the first task was to create SIT
 aaj teen saal ke baad main deshavaasiyon ko bataanaa chahta hum, garv se bataanaa chahta hum ki teen saal ke bheetar-bheetar, kareeb-kareeb sava lakh karod rupye se bhi zyada kalaadhan ko hamane khoj diya he, usko pakadaa he or usko suurender karne ke liye majaboor kiya he
 After that we decided to demonetise
 notebandi ke dwaara hamane anek mahatvapurn safaltaaen praapt kii hai
 The black money that was hidden had to come into the mainstream
 aapane dekha hoga ki ham kabhi 07 din-10 din-15 din badhaate jate the, kabhi petrol pump par, kabhi dawaai kii dukaan par, kabhi railway stesan par puraane note lene kaa silsilaa jari rakhte the, kyonki hamaara prayaas tha ki ek baar jo bhi dhan aae wo bainkon main formal economy kaa hissaa ban jaae or us kaam ko hamane safaltaapurvak paar kiya he
 And the reason for this is that the research that has been done now, is about three lakh crore rupees
 
 
 ye sarkaar ne research nahin kii he, baahar ke expert ne kii he
 Three lakh crore rupees after demonetisation, the additional, which never came back in the banking system, has come
 bainkon main jamaa kii gai raashi main paune do lakh karod se adhik raashi shaq ke ghere main he
 At least two lakh crore rupees of black money has had to reach the banks and now they are forced to give their answers with the system
 nae kaledhan par bhi bahut badi rukaawat aa gai he
 This year, see the result, 56 lakh new taxpayers filing income tax returns from 01 April to 05 August
 pichley saal usee avadhi main ye sankhya sirf 22 lakh thi
 More than double! These reasons are the result of our fight against black money
 18 lakh se zyada aise logon ko pahchaan liya gaya he, jinaki aay unke hisaab kitaab se kuch zyada he, beshumaar zyada he or isaliye is antar kaa unako jawaab dena pad rahaa he
 Out of this, four and a half lakh people have now come to the field, accepting their mistake and trying to get in the way
 ek lakh log aise saamne aae hai, jinhone kabhi jindagi main Income Tax kaa naam bhi nahin suna tha, na Income Tax kabhi diya tha, na kabhi unhone us par sochaa tha, lekin aaj unako wo karnaa pad rahaa he
 Brothers and sisters, if two or four companies are shut down in our country, then there are discussions on them round the clock
 arthniti khatm ho gai


 ye ho gaya, na jane kya kya hota he! aapako jaanakar ke hairaani hogi, kaale dhan ke kaarobaari, Shell companiyaan chalaate the or notebandi ke baad jab data-mining kiya gaya
 Then three lakh such companies have been found, which are just and shell companies only
 hawala kaa kaarobaar karti hai
 Three lakhs, one can imagine
 or usamen se paune do lakh kaa registration hamanen Cancel kar diya he
 If five companies are closed, then there is a storm in India
 paune do lakh companiyon ko taale laga diye
 Those who looted the goods of the country will have to answer, we did this by doing this
 aapako hairaani hogi! kuch to shell companiyaan aisi hai, jo ek hi Address par chaar sau chaar sau companiyaan chal rahi thim, bhaaiyon bahanon
 Four hundred and four hundred companies were operating
 koi dekhne vaala nahin tha, koi poochne vaala nahin tha
 All the collusion was going on
 or isaliye mere bhaaiyon bahanon, maine bhrashtachar kaale dhan ke khilaaf ek bahut badi ladaai chhedi he
 For the betterment of the country, for the welfare of the poor of the country, for the future of the youth of the country
 bhaaiyon bahanon, ek ke baad ek kadam or mujhe vishwaas he GST ke baad usamen or badhotaree hone vaali he
 And Transparency is forthcoming
 akele Transportation hamaara trek vaala ek sthaan se duusare sthaan par jaataa tha
 After this GST, thirty percent of his time is saved
 check-post khatm hone ke kaaran hajaaron karod rupayon kii to bachat hui he
 The biggest savings have been time
 ek prakaar se uski tees pratishat Efficiency bad rahi he
 You can imagine what it means to increase thirty percent efficiency in the transport world of India
 ek GST ke kaaran itnaa bada parivartan aayaa he
 My dear countrymen, today money has come to banks due to demonetisation
 bank apni byaaj dar kam kar rahe hai
 The common man is getting money from the bank through currency
 saamaanya maanav ko apane pairon par khadey hone ke liye avasar mil rahaa he
 Be poor, a middle class person wants to build a house, then banks are coming forward to help him, coming at a lower rate of interest
 ye sara desh ke arthtantr ko gati dene kii disha main kaam kar rahaa he
 My dear countrymen, now is the time
 ham 21veen sadi main hai
 The largest youth group in the world is in our country
 duniya main hamaari pahchaan IT ke dwaara he, Digital World ke dwaara he
 Will we still remain in the same old thinking? are! ek jamaane main chamade ke sikke chalate the, dhire-dhire lupt ho gaye, koi poochne vaala nahin rahaa
 Today the paper notes are going to be converted into digital currency all the time
 ham netritv karen, ham jimmevary len, ham Digital Transaction kii ore jaaen
 We adopt BHIM APP, become part of economic business
 ham Prepaid ke dwaara bhi kaam karen
 And i am happy that Digital transactions have grown
 pichley saal ke mukaable usamen 34 pratishat kaa ijapha hua he or Prepaid bhugtan main kareeb 44 pratishat kaa
 And that's why we should go ahead with a low cash economy
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, sarkaar kii kuch yojanaayen aisi hai, jo hindustan ke saamaanya maanav kii jeb main paise bachaa saken
 If you put an LED bulb, then a thousand rupees two thousand five thousand rupees of the year are going to save you
 agar aap svachh bharat main safal hote hai, to garib kaa saat hajaar kaa rupaya dawaai kaa band hota he
 Controlling inflation has been successful in curbing your rising expenses, in a way your savings
 ‘jan aushadhi kendron’ ke dwaara sasti dawaai kii dukaan garib ke liye ek bahut bada aashirwad bani he
 The expenses that were behind our operation, behind the stent, have come down
 aane vaale dinon main Knee ke Operation ke liye bhi sari suvidhaayen milengi
 Our effort is to reduce these expenses for the poor and middle class human beings and for that we are taking steps one after the other
 pehle hamaare desh main rajyon ke mukhyalay main Dialysis hua karata tha
 We decided to deliver dialysis to the district centers of India
 kareeb saadhe teen sau, chaar sau jilon tak pahunchaa diya or muft main Dialysis karke garib kii jindagi bachaane kaa kaam ham kar rahe hai
 Today the country can be proud that we have developed our systems in front of the world
 GPS System ke dwaara NAVIC Navigation kii vyavastha aaj karne main ham safal hue hai
 Through SAARC Satellite, we have successfully campaigned to help with neighboring countries
 ham ‘tejas’ hawaii jahaaj ke dwaara aaj duniya ke andar apni ahmiyat pahunchaa rahe hai
 The 'BHIM-AADHAR App' is a wonder within the world for Digital Transaction
 rupay Card 
 
 
 In India, rupay Card is worth crores
 or agar wo operational ho jayega, wo agar garibon ke jeb main he, to duniya kaa, ye sabase bada ho jayega
 And that's why my dear countrymen, i request you to move ahead by taking a pledge for 'new India', and do it in time
 hamaare yahaan shastron main kaha gaya haih aniyat kaal:, aniyat kaalah prabhutayo viplavante, prabhutayo viplavante

 My dear countrymen, now is the time
 ham 21veen sadi main hai
 The largest youth group in the world is in our country
 duniya main hamaari pahchaan IT ke dwaara he, Digital World ke dwaara he
 Will we still remain in the same old thinking? are! ek jamaane main chamade ke sikke chalate the, dhire-dhire lupt ho gaye, koi poochne vaala nahin rahaa
 Today the paper notes are going to be converted into digital currency all the time
 ham netritv karen, ham jimmevary len, ham Digital Transaction kii ore jaaen
 We adopt BHIM APP, become part of economic business
 ham Prepaid ke dwaara bhi kaam karen
 And i am happy that Digital transactions have grown
 pichley saal ke mukaable usamen 34 pratishat kaa ijapha hua he or Prepaid bhugtan main kareeb 44 pratishat kaa
 And that's why we should go ahead with a low cash economy
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, sarkaar kii kuch yojanaayen aisi hai, jo hindustan ke saamaanya maanav kii jeb main paise bachaa saken
 If you put an LED bulb, then a thousand rupees two thousand five thousand rupees of the year are going to save you
 agar aap svachh bharat main safal hote hai, to garib kaa saat hajaar kaa rupaya dawaai kaa band hota he
 Controlling inflation has been successful in curbing your rising expenses, in a way your savings
 ‘jan aushadhi kendron’ ke dwaara sasti dawaai kii dukaan garib ke liye ek bahut bada aashirwad bani he
 The expenses that were behind our operation, behind the stent, have come down
 aane vaale dinon main Knee ke Operation ke liye bhi sari suvidhaayen milengi
 Our effort is to reduce these expenses for the poor and middle class human beings and for that we are taking steps one after the other
 pehle hamaare desh main rajyon ke mukhyalay main Dialysis hua karata tha
 We decided to deliver dialysis to the district centers of India
 kareeb saadhe teen sau, chaar sau jilon tak pahunchaa diya or muft main Dialysis karke garib kii jindagi bachaane kaa kaam ham kar rahe hai
 Today the country can be proud that we have developed our systems in front of the world

 Through SAARC Satellite, we have successfully campaigned to help with neighboring countries
 ham ‘tejas’ hawaii jahaaj ke dwaara aaj duniya ke andar apni ahmiyat pahunchaa rahe hai
 The 'BHIM-AADHAR App' is a wonder within the world for Digital Transaction
 rupay Card 
 
 
 In India, rupay Card is worth crores
 or agar wo operational ho jayega, wo agar garibon ke jeb main he, to duniya kaa, ye sabase bada ho jayega
 And that's why my dear countrymen, i request you to move ahead by taking a pledge for 'new India', and do it in time
 hamaare yahaan shastron main kaha gaya haih aniyat kaal:, aniyat kaalah prabhutayo viplavante, prabhutayo viplavante
 If a task is not completed at the right time, then the desired result is never achieved

 Together we will create an India where there will be no compromise on corruption and nepotism
 ham sab milakar ke ek aisa bharat banaaenge, jo svachh hoga, swasth hoga or swaraj ke sapane ko puraa karegaa
 And therefore my dear countrymen, we will all try to work together in this race of development

 bharat mata kii jai, bharat mata kii jai, bharat mata kii jai
 Vande Mataram, Vande Mataram, Vande Mataram, Vande Mataram
 tippaniyan Thank you very much to all
 saabhaar: PIB To create World Class Universities in the field of education, we have taken a major step to break free from bondage
 20 uniwarsitiyon kaa aahvaan kiya he ki aap apane bhagya kaa faisla kiijie, sarkaar kahin bich main nahin aegi
 From above the government is also ready to help up to 1000 crores rupees
 aahvaan kiya he, mujhe vishwaas he mere desh kii shiksha sansthaaon main jarur aage aaenge, isko safal karenge
 In the last three years, 6 iits, 7 new iims, 8 new iiits have been built, and we have also done this work to link education with job opportunities
 meri maatayen, bahanen aaj bahut badi maatra main, parivaar main mahilaayein bhi rojgaar ke liye jaati hai
 And so at night, they get employment opportunities, work in factories, so have taken a very important step to change Labor Laws
 hamaari maatayen, bahanen parivaar kii bhi ek ahm ikai hai
 The contribution of our mothers and sisters is huge to build our future, and so Maternity Leave, which was 12 weeks, will continue to have income in 26 weeks, thus giving has worked
 main aaj hamaari mahilaon ke shashaktikaran ke kaam ke sambandh main, main khaas karke, main un bahanon kaa abhinandan karnaa chahta hum jo teen talaak ke kaaran bahut hi durdavy jindagi jeene ke liye majaboor hui hai
 There is no shelter left, and such afflicted, triple-divorced sisters have started a movement across the country
 desh ke buddhijivi varg ko hilaa diya, desh ke media ne bhi unki madad kii, puure desh main teen-talaak ke khilaaf ek maahaul nirmaan hua
 i heartily congratulate my sisters who are fighting this movement against the triple talaq, and i am sure that in helping them in their fight for the empowerment of mothers and sisters, Will do
 hindustan puri madad karegaa or Women Empowerment ke is mahatvapurn kadam main wo safal hoke rahegi; aisa mujhe puraa bharosa he
 My dear countrymen, sometimes in the name of faith, in the absence of patience some people do such things, which spoil the fabric of society
 desh shanti, sadbhaavna or ekta se chalata he
 The poison of casteism, the poison of communalism, can never benefit the country
 ye to gandhi kii bhoomi he, buddha kii bhoomi he, sabko saath le karke chalanaa; ye is desh kii samskruti or parampara kaa hissaa he
 We have to carry it forward successfully, and hence violence cannot be stressed in the name of faith
 aspataal main to patient ke saath kuch ho jaae, aspataal jala diya jaae; aksmaat ho jaae, gaadiyaan jala diya jaaen; andolan karen, sarkari sampatti ko jala diya jaae; aaazaad hindustan ke liye ye kiskaa he? hamaare sava sau karod deshavaasiyon kii sampatti he
 Whose cultural heritage is this? This is the cultural heritage of 1
25 billion countrymen
 ye aasthaa kiski he? ham sava sau karod deshavaasiyon kii aasthaa he; or isliye aasthaa ke naam par hinsa kaa rasta, is desh main kabhi bhi chal nahin saktaa, yah desh kabhi sweekaar nahin kar saktaa he
 And so i will urge the countrymen, at that time there was the slogan 'quit India', today the slogan is 'add India'
 vyakti-vyakti ko hamane saath lenaa he, jan-jan ko saath lenaa he, samaaj ke har tabake ko saath lenaa he, or usee ko le karke hamen desh ko aage badhanaa he
 We need a strong economy to build a prosperous India
 santulit vikaas chahie, next generation infrastructure chahie, tab ja kar ke hamaare sapanom ke bharat ko ham apni ankhon ke saamne dekh sakate hai
 Brothers and sisters, we have taken countless decisions in three years
 kuch chizon ko notice kiya gaya he or kuch chijen shaayad notice main nahin ai
 But one thing is important
 jab aap itnaa bada badlaav karte he to rukvaaten aati hai, gati ruk jaati he
 But see the working style of this government, if the train also passes near a railway station, when the track changes, the speed running from 60 has to be brought to the speed of 30
 trek badalane par train kii speed kam ho jaati he
 We are trying to take the whole country to a new track, but we have not let his speed down, we have kept his pace
 chaahe GST laaen ho, koi bhi kanoon laaen ho, koi bhi nai vyavastha laae ho, ham usko karne main safal hue he or aage bhi isko ham karenge
 We have laid emphasis on infrastructure
 abhootpurv kharch infrastructure par die ja rahe hai
 The railway station should be modernized, in a small town, whether to build an airport, whether to arrange water-way, whether to arrange roadways, whether to build gas grid, whether to grid water, whether to do optical fiber network , We are giving full emphasis on all types of modern infrastructure
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, 21veen sadi main bharat ko aage badhaane kaa sabase urjavan kshetra he, hamaara purvi hindustan
 There is so much potential, powerful human resource, immense natural wealth, rich of hard work, and ability to change life by resolving
 hamaara puraa dhyaan purvi uttar pradesh, bihar, bengal, assam, north east, odisha, ye hamaare aise samarthyavan rajya hai, jahaan prakritik sampada bharpoor he, usko aage badhaakar ke desh ko ek nai oonchai par le jane kii disha main ham prayatnrat he
 Brothers and sisters, corruption-free India is a very important task, we are trying to strengthen it
 sarkaar banane ke baad pehla kaam kiya tha SIT banane kaa
 Today, after three years, i want to tell the countrymen, proudly tell them that within three years, we have discovered more than about 1
25 lakh crore rupees of black money, caught it and suurender it
 Is forced
 uske baad hamane notebandi kaa faisla kiya
 We have achieved many significant successes through demonetisation
 jo kalaadhan chipa hua tha, usko mukhyadhara main aana padaa
 You must have seen that we sometimes used to extend 07 days-10 days-15 days, sometimes at the petrol pump, sometimes at the drugstore, sometimes at the railway station, we continued to take old notes, because our effort was once Money should also become a part of the formal economy in the banks and we have successfully completed that work
 or iskaa kaaran yah hua he ki abhi jo research hua he, kareeb teen lakh karod rupye
 
 
 This government has not done research, outside experts have done it
 notebandi ke baad teen lakh karod rupye, jo atirikt, jo kabhi banking system main waapas nahin aata tha wo aayaa he
 More than a quarter of a million rupees in the amount deposited in banks is under suspicion
 kam se kam do lakh karod rupye se zyada kalaadhan usko bainko tak pahunchnaa padaa he or ab vyavastha ke saath unako apana jawaab dene ke liye majaboor hue hai
 The new black money has also come to a great halt
 is varsh, iskaa parinaam dekhie, 01 april se 05 agast tak income tax return daakhil karne vaale nae vyaktigat karadaataaon kii sankhya 56 lakh
 In the same period last year, this number was only 2
2 million
 Double se bhi zyada! ye kaaran kaledhan ke khilaaf hamaari ladaai kaa parinaam he
 More than 18 lakh people have been identified, whose income is more than the book according to them, they are uncountable and hence they have to answer this difference
 saadhe chaar lakh log isamen se ab maidan main aaye hai, apni galati sweekaar karke raste main aane kaa prayaas kar rahe hai
 One lakh people have come forward, who had never heard of income tax in life, nor had ever given income tax, nor had they thought of it, but today they have to do it
 bhaaiyon bahanon, hamaare desh main agar do chaar companiyaan bhi kahin band ho jaae, to choubison ghante us par charchaaen hoti hai us par Debates hoti hai
 Economy is over


 it is done, no matter what happens! You'd be surprised to know, black money traders, Shell used to run companies and after demonetisation when data-mining was done
 tab teen lakh aisi companiyaan pai gayi hai, jo sirf or sirf shell companiyaan hai
 Does hawala business
 teen lakh, koi kalpana kar saktaa he
 And we have canceled the registration of one and a half lakh from that
 paanch companiyaan band ho jaae to hindustan main tufaan much jaataa he
 Locked up to twenty two lakh companies
 desh kaa maal luutane waalon ko jawaab dena padegaa, ye kaam hamane kar ke dikhaaya
 You will be surprised! Some shell companies are such that four hundred and four hundred companies were running at the same address, brothers and sisters
 chaar sau chaar sau companiyaan chal rahi thim
 Nobody was going to see, nobody was going to ask
 sari mileebhagat chal rahi thi
 And so my brothers and sisters, i have waged a very big fight against corruption black money
 desh kii bhalaai ke liye desh ke garibon ke kalyaan ke liye, desh ke naujavaanon ke bhavishya ko banane ke liye
 Brothers and sisters, one step after the other, and i am sure it will increase further after GST
 or Transparency aane vaali he
 Transportation alone Our truck used to go from one place to another
 ye GST ke baad tees pratishat uskaa samay batch gaya he
 Thousands of crores of rupees have been saved due to the end of check-post
 sabase badi bachat samay kii hui he
 In a way, its thirty percent efficiency is increasing
 aap kalpana kar sakate hai hindustan ke Transport jagat main tees pratishat Efficiency badhane kaa matlab kya hota he
 a GST has brought about such a big change
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, aaj notebandi ke kaaran bainko ke paas dhan aayaa he
 Banks are reducing their interest rate
 mudra ke dwaara saamaanya maanav ko bank se paisa mil rahaa he
 The common man is getting an opportunity to stand on his feet
 garib ho, madhyavarg kaa vyakti ho ghar bananaa chahta he, to bank usko madad karne ke liye aage aa rahe hai, kam byaaj kii dar se aage aa rahe hai
 It is working towards accelerating the economy of the country
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, ab ye vakt badal chukaa he
 We are in the 21st century
 vishwa kaa sabase bada yuva varg hamaare desh main he
 Our identity in the world is by IT, by Digital World
 kya ab bhi ham usee pooraani soch main rahenge
 Hey! Once upon a time, leather coins used to move, slowly disappeared, no one was asking
 aaj jo kaagaj ke note hai, samay aate rahete wo sara kaa sara Digital Currency main Convert hone vaala he
 Let us lead, let us take responsibility, let us go towards Digital Transaction
 ham BHIM APP ko apanaaen, aarthik kaarobaar kaa hissaa banaaen
 We also work through Prepaid
 or mujhe khushi he ki Digital lenden badi he
 It has increased by 34 percent over the previous year and about 44 percent in prepaid payments
 or isaliye kam cash vaali arthvyavastha, usko lekar ke hamen aage badhanaa chahie
 My dear countrymen, there are few schemes of the government that can save money in the pockets of the common man of India
 agar aap LED Bulb lagaate hai, to saal bhar kaa hajaar do hajaar paanch hajaar rupaya aapkaa bachane vaala he
 If you succeed in a clean India, then the poor's medicine of seven thousand rupees stops
 mahangaai par niyantran, aapke badhate hue kharch ko rokane main safal hua he, ek prakaar se aapaki bachat he
 Affordable medicine shops have become a huge blessing for the poor through 'jan Aushadhi Kendras'
 hamaare yahaan Operation ke peeche, stent ke peeche jo kharch hote the wo kam hue hai
 In the coming days, all facilities will also be available for Knee's operation
 hamaari koshish he ki garib or madhyamvarg ke maanav ke liye ye kharch kam ho or uske liye ham ek ke baad ek kadam uthaa rahe hai
 Earlier, dialysis used to take place in the headquarters of the states in our country
 hamane tay kiya hindustan ke jila kendron tak Dialysis pahunchaayenge
 Nearly three and a half hundred and four hundred districts have been reached and by dialysis for free, we are working to save the life of the poor
 aaj desh garv kar saktaa he ki hamane vishwa ke saamne apni vyavasthaaon ko viksit kiya he
 Today we have succeeded in arranging NAVIC Navigation through GPS System
 hamane SAARC Satellite ke dwaara hamane padosi deshon ke saath madad karne kaa safal abhiyaan kiya he
 We are delivering our importance inside the world today by 'tejas' airplane
 ‘BHIM-AADHAR App’ duniya ke andar Digital Transaction ke liye ek ajooba bana hua he
 rupay Card
 
 
 hindustan main rupay Card karodon kii taadaad main he
 And if it becomes operational, if it is in the pocket of the poor, then it will become the largest in the world
 or isaliye mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, meraa aapse yahi aagrah he ki ham ‘new India’ kaa sankalp le kar ke aage badhen, samay rahete hue karen
 It is said in our scriptures: Aniyat Kaal: Aniyat Kaal: Prabhutyo Viplavante, Prabhutayo Viplavante
 sahi samay par agar koi kaary puraa nahin kiya gaya, to phir icchit parinaam kabhi nahin milte hai
 And so for 'team India', for Team India of 1
25 billion countrymen, today we have to pledge to make 'new India' by 2022 and we will do this work ourselves, no one will do it, we will do it ourselves
 desh ke liye karenge, pehle se acha karenge, pehle se zyada karenge, samarpan bhav se karenge, 2022 main ‘bhavy-divya’ hindustan dekhne ke liye karenge
 And that's why we will all together create an India where the poor have a pucca house, electricity, water
 ham sab milakar ek aisa bharat banaaenge, jahaan desh kaa kisaan chintaa main nahin chaiyn se soyega
 By 2022, he will earn twice as much as he is earning today
 ham sab milakar ke ek aisa hindustan banaaenge, jahaan yuvaaon, mahilaon ko apane sapane puure karne ke liye bharpoor avasar uplabdh honge
 Together we will create an India that will be free from terrorism, communalism and casteism
 ham sab milakar ke ek aisa bharat banaaenge, jahaan bhrashtachar or bhai-bhatijawad se koi samjhauta nahin hoga
 Together we will create an India that will be clean, healthy and fulfill the dream of Swaraj
 or isaliye mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, ham sab milakar ke vikaas kii is daud main aage chalane kaa prayaas karenge
 Today, after 70 years of independence, in the midst of waiting for 75 years of independence, in the important tenure of five years, all of us countrymen should go with the dream of a 'divine-grand India', with this same sentiment i once again i bow to the crazy people
 sava sau karod deshavaasiyon ke nae vishwaas, nai umang ko naman karata hum
 And call upon 'team India' to move forward with a new resolution
 isi bhaavana ke saath aap sabko hriday se meri bahut bahut shubhakamanaayen
 Bharat Mata Ki Jai, Vande Mataram Jai Hind
 jai hind, jai hind, jai hind, jai hind
 Bharat Mata Ki Jai, Bharat Mata Ki Jai, Bharat Mata Ki Jai
 vande maataram, vande maataram, vande maataram, vande maataram
 The comments sabhi kaa bahut bahut dhanyavad
 Sincerely: PIB pichley teen varsh main 6 IIT, 7 nae IIM, 8 nae IIIT, iskaa nirmaan kiya he or shiksha ko naukari ke avasaron ke saath jodne kaa bhi is ko kaam hamane kiya he
 My mothers, sisters, today, in large quantities, women in the family also go for employment
 or isliye raatri ko bhi unako rojgaar kaa avasar mili, factoriyon main kaam karne kaa avasar mili, isliye Labour Laws main parivartan karne kaa bahut bada ahm kadam uthaaya he
 Our mothers and sisters are also an important unit of the family
 hamaara bhavishya nirmaan karne ke liye hamaari maataaon, bahanon kaa yogadan bahut bada hota he, or isliye Maternity Leave jo 12 saptaah kii thi, wo 26 saptaah, usamen aay chaalu rahegi, is prakaar se dene kaa kaam kiya he
 With regard to the work of empowerment of our women today, in particular, i would like to congratulate the sisters who have been forced to live a very difficult life due to triple talaq
 koi aashray nahin bachaa he, or aisi peedit, teen-talaak se peedit bahanon ne puure desh main ek andolan khadaa kiya he
 The intellectual class of the country was shaken, the media of the country also helped them, an atmosphere was created against triple talaq in the whole country
 is andolan ko chalaane vaali un meri bahanon ko, jo teen-talaak ke khilaaf ladai lard rahi hai, main hriday se unka abhindann karata hum or mujhe vishwaas he, ki maataaon-bahanon ko adhikaar dilaane main, unki is ladaai main hindustan unki puri madad karegaa
 Hindustan will help and it will be successful in this important step of Women Empowerment; i am sure of this
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyo, kabhi-kabhi aasthaa ke naam par dhairya ke abhaav main kuch log aisi chijen kar baithte hai, jo samaaj ke taane-bane ko bikher detii hai
 The country operates with peace, goodwill and unity
 jatvaad kaa jehar, sampradayawad kaa jehar, desh kaa kabhi bhala nahin kar saktaa he
 This is Gandhi's land, Buddha's land, take everyone along and walk; It is part of the culture and tradition of this country
 hamen isko safalataa se aage badhanaa he, or isliye aasthaa ke naam par hinsa ko bal nahin diya ja saktaa he
 If something happens to the patient in the hospital, the hospital is burnt; Accidentally, carts should be burnt; Move, government property be burned; Whose is this for Azad Hindustan? We have assets of 1
25 billion countrymen
 ye saanskrithik viraasat kiski he? ye ham sava sau karod deshavaasiyon kii saanskrithik viraasat he
 Whose faith is this? We are the faith of 125 crore countrymen; And so the path of violence in the name of faith can never go on in this country, this country can never accept
 or isliye main deshavaasiyon se aagrah karuunga, us samay ‘bharat chodo’ kaa naaraa tha, aaj naaraa he ‘bharat jodo’
 We have to take person-to-person, take people-to-people, we have to take every section of the society together, and we have to take the country forward by taking the same
 samrudh bharat banane ke liye hamaari majboot arthvyavastha chahie
 We need balanced development, next generation infrastructure, then we can see the India of our dreams in front of our eyes
 bhaaiyo-bahanon, anginat nirnay hamane teen saal main liye
 Some things have been noted and some things may not have come into notice
 lekin ek baat mahatvapurn he
 When you make such a big change, the stops come, the speed stops
 lekin is sarkaar kii kaaryastylee dekhie, agar train bhi kisi railway stesan ke paas se guzarati he, jab trek badalati he to 60 se chalane vaali speed ko usko 30 kii speed main laana padataa he
 The speed of the train decreases by changing the track
 ham puure desh ko ek nae trek par le jane kaa prayaas kar rahe hai, lekin hamane uski speed kam nahin hone di he, hamane uski gati ko barkaraar rakhaa he
 Whether we bring GST, any law, any new system, we have succeeded in doing that and we will do it in future
 hamane infrastructure par bal diya he
 Unprecedented expenses are being given on infrastructure
 railway stesan kaa aadhunikeekaran ho, chote shahar main, chaahe airport bananaa ho, chaahe water-way kii vyavastha kerani ho, chaahe roadways kii vyavastha kerani ho, chaahe gas grid banani ho, chaahe pani kii grid karaani ho, chaahe optical fibre network karnaa ho, har prakaar ke aadhunik infrastructure par ham purna bal de rahe hai
 My dear countrymen, our eastern India is the most energetic field to advance India in the 21st century
 itnaa potential he, samarthyavan maanav sansaadhan he, apaar prakritik sampada he, parishram ke dhani hai, sankalp karke jindagi badalane kaa samarthy rakhte hai
 Our entire focus is on eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Bengal, Assam, North East, Odisha, these are our powerful states, where natural wealth is abundant, we are trying to take the country to a new height by taking it forward
 bhaaiyo-bahanon, bhrashtachar mukt bharat ek bada ahm kaam he, usko ham bal dene kaa prayaas kar rahe he
 After the formation of the government, the first task was to create SIT
 aaj teen saal ke baad main deshavaasiyon ko bataanaa chahta hum, garv se bataanaa chahta hum ki teen saal ke bheetar-bheetar, kareeb-kareeb sava lakh karod rupye se bhi zyada kalaadhan ko hamane khoj diya he, usko pakadaa he or usko suurender karne ke liye majaboor kiya he
 After that we decided to demonetise
 notebandi ke dwaara hamane anek mahatvapurn safaltaaen praapt kii hai
 The black money that was hidden had to come into the mainstream
 aapane dekha hoga ki ham kabhi 07 din-10 din-15 din badhaate jate the, kabhi petrol pump par, kabhi dawaai kii dukaan par, kabhi railway stesan par puraane note lene kaa silsilaa jari rakhte the, kyonki hamaara prayaas tha ki ek baar jo bhi dhan aae wo bainkon main formal economy kaa hissaa ban jaae or us kaam ko hamane safaltaapurvak paar kiya he
 And the reason for this is that the research that has been done now, is about three lakh crore rupees
 
 
 ye sarkaar ne research nahin kii he, baahar ke expert ne kii he
 Three lakh crore rupees after demonetisation, the additional, which never came back in the banking system, has come
 bainkon main jamaa kii gai raashi main paune do lakh karod se adhik raashi shaq ke ghere main he
 At least two lakh crore rupees of black money has had to reach the banks and now they are forced to give their answers with the system
 nae kaledhan par bhi bahut badi rukaawat aa gai he
 This year, see the result, 56 lakh new taxpayers filing income tax returns from 01 April to 05 August
 pichley saal usee avadhi main ye sankhya sirf 22 lakh thi
 More than double! These reasons are the result of our fight against black money
 18 lakh se zyada aise logon ko pahchaan liya gaya he, jinaki aay unke hisaab kitaab se kuch zyada he, beshumaar zyada he or isaliye is antar kaa unako jawaab dena pad rahaa he
 Out of this, four and a half lakh people have now come to the field, accepting their mistake and trying to get in the way
 ek lakh log aise saamne aae hai, jinhone kabhi jindagi main Income Tax kaa naam bhi nahin suna tha, na Income Tax kabhi diya tha, na kabhi unhone us par sochaa tha, lekin aaj unako wo karnaa pad rahaa he
 Brothers and sisters, if two or four companies are shut down in our country, then there are discussions on them round the clock
 arthniti khatm ho gai


 ye ho gaya, na jane kya kya hota he! aapako jaanakar ke hairaani hogi, kaale dhan ke kaarobaari, Shell companiyaan chalaate the or notebandi ke baad jab data-mining kiya gaya
 Then three lakh such companies have been found, which are just and shell companies only
 hawala kaa kaarobaar karti hai
 Three lakhs, one can imagine
 or usamen se paune do lakh kaa registration hamanen Cancel kar diya he
 If five companies are closed, then there is a storm in India
 paune do lakh companiyon ko taale laga diye
 Those who looted the goods of the country will have to answer, we did this by doing this
 aapako hairaani hogi! kuch to shell companiyaan aisi hai, jo ek hi Address par chaar sau chaar sau companiyaan chal rahi thim, bhaaiyon bahanon
 Four hundred and four hundred companies were operating
 koi dekhne vaala nahin tha, koi poochne vaala nahin tha
 All the collusion was going on
 or isaliye mere bhaaiyon bahanon, maine bhrashtachar kaale dhan ke khilaaf ek bahut badi ladaai chhedi he
 For the betterment of the country, for the welfare of the poor of the country, for the future of the youth of the country
 bhaaiyon bahanon, ek ke baad ek kadam or mujhe vishwaas he GST ke baad usamen or badhotaree hone vaali he
 And Transparency is forthcoming
 akele Transportation hamaara trek vaala ek sthaan se duusare sthaan par jaataa tha
 After this GST, thirty percent of his time is saved
 check-post khatm hone ke kaaran hajaaron karod rupayon kii to bachat hui he
 The biggest savings have been time
 ek prakaar se uski tees pratishat Efficiency bad rahi he
 You can imagine what it means to increase thirty percent efficiency in the transport world of India
 ek GST ke kaaran itnaa bada parivartan aayaa he
 My dear countrymen, today money has come to banks due to demonetisation

 Whether we bring GST, any law, any new system, we have succeeded in doing that and we will do it in future

 My dear countrymen, our eastern India is the most energetic field to advance India in the 21st century
 itnaa potential he, samarthyavan maanav sansaadhan he, apaar prakritik sampada he, parishram ke dhani hai, sankalp karke jindagi badalane kaa samarthy rakhte hai
 Our entire focus is on eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Bengal, Assam, North East, Odisha, these are our powerful states, where natural wealth is abundant, we are trying to take the country to a new height by taking it forward
 bhaaiyo-bahanon, bhrashtachar mukt bharat ek bada ahm kaam he, usko ham bal dene kaa prayaas kar rahe he
 After the formation of the government, the first task was to create SIT
 aaj teen saal ke baad main deshavaasiyon ko bataanaa chahta hum, garv se bataanaa chahta hum ki teen saal ke bheetar-bheetar, kareeb-kareeb sava lakh karod rupye se bhi zyada kalaadhan ko hamane khoj diya he, usko pakadaa he or usko suurender karne ke liye majaboor kiya he
 After that we decided to demonetise
 notebandi ke dwaara hamane anek mahatvapurn safaltaaen praapt kii hai
 The black money that was hidden had to come into the mainstream
 aapane dekha hoga ki ham kabhi 07 din-10 din-15 din badhaate jate the, kabhi petrol pump par, kabhi dawaai kii dukaan par, kabhi railway stesan par puraane note lene kaa silsilaa jari rakhte the, kyonki hamaara prayaas tha ki ek baar jo bhi dhan aae wo bainkon main formal economy kaa hissaa ban jaae or us kaam ko hamane safaltaapurvak paar kiya he
 And the reason for this is that the research that has been done now, is about three lakh crore rupees
 
 
 ye sarkaar ne research nahin kii he, baahar ke expert ne kii he
 Three lakh crore rupees after demonetisation, the additional, which never came back in the banking system, has come
 bainkon main jamaa kii gai raashi main paune do lakh karod se adhik raashi shaq ke ghere main he
 At least two lakh crore rupees of black money has had to reach the banks and now they are forced to give their answers with the system
 nae kaledhan par bhi bahut badi rukaawat aa gai he
 This year, see the result, 56 lakh new taxpayers filing income tax returns from 01 April to 05 August
 pichley saal usee avadhi main ye sankhya sirf 22 lakh thi
 More than double! These reasons are the result of our fight against black money
 18 lakh se zyada aise logon ko pahchaan liya gaya he, jinaki aay unke hisaab kitaab se kuch zyada he, beshumaar zyada he or isaliye is antar kaa unako jawaab dena pad rahaa he
 Out of this, four and a half lakh people have now come to the field, accepting their mistake and trying to get in the way
 ek lakh log aise saamne aae hai, jinhone kabhi jindagi main Income Tax kaa naam bhi nahin suna tha, na Income Tax kabhi diya tha, na kabhi unhone us par sochaa tha, lekin aaj unako wo karnaa pad rahaa he
 Brothers and sisters, if two or four companies are shut down in our country, then there are discussions on them round the clock

 Then three lakh such companies have been found, which are just and shell companies only
 hawala kaa kaarobaar karti hai
 Three lakhs, one can imagine
 or usamen se paune do lakh kaa registration hamanen Cancel kar diya he
 If five companies are closed, then there is a storm in India
 paune do lakh companiyon ko taale laga diye
 Those who looted the goods of the country will have to answer, we did this by doing this
 aapako hairaani hogi! kuch to shell companiyaan aisi hai, jo ek hi Address par chaar sau chaar sau companiyaan chal rahi thim, bhaaiyon bahanon
 Four hundred and four hundred companies were operating
 koi dekhne vaala nahin tha, koi poochne vaala nahin tha
 All the collusion was going on
 or isaliye mere bhaaiyon bahanon, maine bhrashtachar kaale dhan ke khilaaf ek bahut badi ladaai chhedi he
 For the betterment of the country, for the welfare of the poor of the country, for the future of the youth of the country

 You can imagine what it means to increase thirty percent efficiency in the transport world of India
 ek GST ke kaaran itnaa bada parivartan aayaa he

 Will we still remain in the same old thinking? are! ek jamaane main chamade ke sikke chalate the, dhire-dhire lupt ho gaye, koi poochne vaala nahin rahaa
 Today the paper notes are going to be converted into digital currency all the time
 ham netritv karen, ham jimmevary len, ham Digital Transaction kii ore jaaen
 We adopt BHIM APP, become part of economic business
 ham Prepaid ke dwaara bhi kaam karen
 And i am happy that Digital transactions have grown
 pichley saal ke mukaable usamen 34 pratishat kaa ijapha hua he or Prepaid bhugtan main kareeb 44 pratishat kaa
 And that's why we should go ahead with a low cash economy
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, sarkaar kii kuch yojanaayen aisi hai, jo hindustan ke saamaanya maanav kii jeb main paise bachaa saken
 If you put an LED bulb, then a thousand rupees two thousand five thousand rupees of the year are going to save you
 agar aap svachh bharat main safal hote hai, to garib kaa saat hajaar kaa rupaya dawaai kaa band hota he
 Controlling inflation has been successful in curbing your rising expenses, in a way your savings
 ‘jan aushadhi kendron’ ke dwaara sasti dawaai kii dukaan garib ke liye ek bahut bada aashirwad bani he
 The expenses that were behind our operation, behind the stent, have come down
 aane vaale dinon main Knee ke Operation ke liye bhi sari suvidhaayen milengi
 Our effort is to reduce these expenses for the poor and middle class human beings and for that we are taking steps one after the other
 pehle hamaare desh main rajyon ke mukhyalay main Dialysis hua karata tha
 We decided to deliver dialysis to the district centers of India
 kareeb saadhe teen sau, chaar sau jilon tak pahunchaa diya or muft main Dialysis karke garib kii jindagi bachaane kaa kaam ham kar rahe hai
 Today the country can be proud that we have developed our systems in front of the world
 GPS System ke dwaara NAVIC Navigation kii vyavastha aaj karne main ham safal hue hai
 Through SAARC Satellite, we have successfully campaigned to help with neighboring countries
 ham ‘tejas’ hawaii jahaaj ke dwaara aaj duniya ke andar apni ahmiyat pahunchaa rahe hai
 The 'BHIM-AADHAR App' is a wonder within the world for Digital Transaction
 rupay Card 
 
 
 In India, rupay Card is worth crores
 or agar wo operational ho jayega, wo agar garibon ke jeb main he, to duniya kaa, ye sabase bada ho jayega
 And that's why my dear countrymen, i request you to move ahead by taking a pledge for 'new India', and do it in time
 hamaare yahaan shastron main kaha gaya haih aniyat kaal:, aniyat kaalah prabhutayo viplavante, prabhutayo viplavante
 If a task is not completed at the right time, then the desired result is never achieved
 or isaliye ‘team India’ ke liye, sava sau karod deshavaasiyon kii team India ke liye, aaj hamen sankalp lenaa hoga 2022 tak ‘new India’ banane kaa or ye kaam ham khud karenge, koi karegaa aisa nahin, ham khud karenge
 Will do for the country, will do better than before, will do more than before, will do it with dedication, in 2022 to see 'grand-divine' Hindustan
 or isaliye ham sab milakar ke ek aisa bharat banaaenge jahaan garib ke paas pakkaa ghar ho, bijli ho, pani ho
 Together we will create an India where the farmer of the country will sleep peacefully
 aaj wo jitna kama rahaa he, usase 2022 tak doguna kamayega
 Together we will create an India where youth and women will have ample opportunities to fulfill their dreams
 ham sab milakar ke ek aisa bharat banaaenge, jo aatankwaad sampradayawad or jatvaad se mukt hoga
 Together we will create an India where there will be no compromise on corruption and nepotism
 ham sab milakar ke ek aisa bharat banaaenge, jo svachh hoga, swasth hoga or swaraj ke sapane ko puraa karegaa
 And therefore my dear countrymen, we will all try to work together in this race of development
 aaj aazaadee ke 70 saal ke baad, aazaadee ke 75 saal kii pratiksha ke bich paanch saal ke mahatvapurn kaarykaal main ek ‘divya-bhavy bharat’ ke sapane ko lekar ke ham sabhi deshvasi chalem, isi ek bhav ke saath main phir ek baar aazaadee ke diwaanon ko pranaam karata hum
 i salute the new faith, new zeal of 1
25 billion countrymen
 or nae sankalp ke saath aage chalane ke liye ‘team India’ ko aahvaan karata hum
 With this feeling, my heartiest greetings to all of you
 bharat mata kii jai, vande maataram jai hind
 Jai Hind, Jai Hind, Jai Hind, Jai Hind
 bharat mata kii jai, bharat mata kii jai, bharat mata kii jai
 Vande Mataram, Vande Mataram, Vande Mataram, Vande Mataram
 tippaniyan Thank you very much to all
 saabhaar: PIB With regard to the work of empowerment of our women today, in particular, i would like to congratulate the sisters who have been forced to live a very difficult life due to triple talaq
 koi aashray nahin bachaa he, or aisi peedit, teen-talaak se peedit bahanon ne puure desh main ek andolan khadaa kiya he
 The intellectual class of the country was shaken, the media of the country also helped them, an atmosphere was created against triple talaq in the whole country
 is andolan ko chalaane vaali un meri bahanon ko, jo teen-talaak ke khilaaf ladai lard rahi hai, main hriday se unka abhindann karata hum or mujhe vishwaas he, ki maataaon-bahanon ko adhikaar dilaane main, unki is ladaai main hindustan unki puri madad karegaa
 Hindustan will help and it will be successful in this important step of Women Empowerment; i am sure of this
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyo, kabhi-kabhi aasthaa ke naam par dhairya ke abhaav main kuch log aisi chijen kar baithte hai, jo samaaj ke taane-bane ko bikher detii hai
 The country operates with peace, goodwill and unity
 jatvaad kaa jehar, sampradayawad kaa jehar, desh kaa kabhi bhala nahin kar saktaa he
 This is Gandhi's land, Buddha's land, take everyone along and walk; It is part of the culture and tradition of this country
 hamen isko safalataa se aage badhanaa he, or isliye aasthaa ke naam par hinsa ko bal nahin diya ja saktaa he
 If something happens to the patient in the hospital, the hospital is burnt; Accidentally, carts should be burnt; Move, government property be burned; Whose is this for Azad Hindustan? We have assets of 1
25 billion countrymen
 ye saanskrithik viraasat kiski he? ye ham sava sau karod deshavaasiyon kii saanskrithik viraasat he
 Whose faith is this? We are the faith of 125 crore countrymen; And so the path of violence in the name of faith can never go on in this country, this country can never accept
 or isliye main deshavaasiyon se aagrah karuunga, us samay ‘bharat chodo’ kaa naaraa tha, aaj naaraa he ‘bharat jodo’
 We have to take person-to-person, take people-to-people, we have to take every section of the society together, and we have to take the country forward by taking the same
 samrudh bharat banane ke liye hamaari majboot arthvyavastha chahie
 We need balanced development, next generation infrastructure, then we can see the India of our dreams in front of our eyes
 bhaaiyo-bahanon, anginat nirnay hamane teen saal main liye
 Some things have been noted and some things may not have come into notice
 lekin ek baat mahatvapurn he
 When you make such a big change, the stops come, the speed stops
 lekin is sarkaar kii kaaryastylee dekhie, agar train bhi kisi railway stesan ke paas se guzarati he, jab trek badalati he to 60 se chalane vaali speed ko usko 30 kii speed main laana padataa he
 The speed of the train decreases by changing the track
 ham puure desh ko ek nae trek par le jane kaa prayaas kar rahe hai, lekin hamane uski speed kam nahin hone di he, hamane uski gati ko barkaraar rakhaa he
 Whether we bring GST, any law, any new system, we have succeeded in doing that and we will do it in future
 hamane infrastructure par bal diya he
 Unprecedented expenses are being given on infrastructure
 railway stesan kaa aadhunikeekaran ho, chote shahar main, chaahe airport bananaa ho, chaahe water-way kii vyavastha kerani ho, chaahe roadways kii vyavastha kerani ho, chaahe gas grid banani ho, chaahe pani kii grid karaani ho, chaahe optical fibre network karnaa ho, har prakaar ke aadhunik infrastructure par ham purna bal de rahe hai
 My dear countrymen, our eastern India is the most energetic field to advance India in the 21st century
 itnaa potential he, samarthyavan maanav sansaadhan he, apaar prakritik sampada he, parishram ke dhani hai, sankalp karke jindagi badalane kaa samarthy rakhte hai
 Our entire focus is on eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Bengal, Assam, North East, Odisha, these are our powerful states, where natural wealth is abundant, we are trying to take the country to a new height by taking it forward
 bhaaiyo-bahanon, bhrashtachar mukt bharat ek bada ahm kaam he, usko ham bal dene kaa prayaas kar rahe he
 After the formation of the government, the first task was to create SIT
 aaj teen saal ke baad main deshavaasiyon ko bataanaa chahta hum, garv se bataanaa chahta hum ki teen saal ke bheetar-bheetar, kareeb-kareeb sava lakh karod rupye se bhi zyada kalaadhan ko hamane khoj diya he, usko pakadaa he or usko suurender karne ke liye majaboor kiya he
 After that we decided to demonetise
 notebandi ke dwaara hamane anek mahatvapurn safaltaaen praapt kii hai
 The black money that was hidden had to come into the mainstream
 aapane dekha hoga ki ham kabhi 07 din-10 din-15 din badhaate jate the, kabhi petrol pump par, kabhi dawaai kii dukaan par, kabhi railway stesan par puraane note lene kaa silsilaa jari rakhte the, kyonki hamaara prayaas tha ki ek baar jo bhi dhan aae wo bainkon main formal economy kaa hissaa ban jaae or us kaam ko hamane safaltaapurvak paar kiya he
 And the reason for this is that the research that has been done now, is about three lakh crore rupees
 
 
 ye sarkaar ne research nahin kii he, baahar ke expert ne kii he
 Three lakh crore rupees after demonetisation, the additional, which never came back in the banking system, has come
 bainkon main jamaa kii gai raashi main paune do lakh karod se adhik raashi shaq ke ghere main he
 At least two lakh crore rupees of black money has had to reach the banks and now they are forced to give their answers with the system
 nae kaledhan par bhi bahut badi rukaawat aa gai he
 This year, see the result, 56 lakh new taxpayers filing income tax returns from 01 April to 05 August
 pichley saal usee avadhi main ye sankhya sirf 22 lakh thi
 More than double! These reasons are the result of our fight against black money
 18 lakh se zyada aise logon ko pahchaan liya gaya he, jinaki aay unke hisaab kitaab se kuch zyada he, beshumaar zyada he or isaliye is antar kaa unako jawaab dena pad rahaa he
 Out of this, four and a half lakh people have now come to the field, accepting their mistake and trying to get in the way
 ek lakh log aise saamne aae hai, jinhone kabhi jindagi main Income Tax kaa naam bhi nahin suna tha, na Income Tax kabhi diya tha, na kabhi unhone us par sochaa tha, lekin aaj unako wo karnaa pad rahaa he
 Brothers and sisters, if two or four companies are shut down in our country, then there are discussions on them round the clock
 arthniti khatm ho gai


 ye ho gaya, na jane kya kya hota he! aapako jaanakar ke hairaani hogi, kaale dhan ke kaarobaari, Shell companiyaan chalaate the or notebandi ke baad jab data-mining kiya gaya
 Then three lakh such companies have been found, which are just and shell companies only
 hawala kaa kaarobaar karti hai
 Three lakhs, one can imagine
 or usamen se paune do lakh kaa registration hamanen Cancel kar diya he
 If five companies are closed, then there is a storm in India
 paune do lakh companiyon ko taale laga diye
 Those who looted the goods of the country will have to answer, we did this by doing this
 aapako hairaani hogi! kuch to shell companiyaan aisi hai, jo ek hi Address par chaar sau chaar sau companiyaan chal rahi thim, bhaaiyon bahanon
 Four hundred and four hundred companies were operating
 koi dekhne vaala nahin tha, koi poochne vaala nahin tha
 All the collusion was going on
 or isaliye mere bhaaiyon bahanon, maine bhrashtachar kaale dhan ke khilaaf ek bahut badi ladaai chhedi he
 For the betterment of the country, for the welfare of the poor of the country, for the future of the youth of the country
 bhaaiyon bahanon, ek ke baad ek kadam or mujhe vishwaas he GST ke baad usamen or badhotaree hone vaali he
 And Transparency is forthcoming
 akele Transportation hamaara trek vaala ek sthaan se duusare sthaan par jaataa tha
 After this GST, thirty percent of his time is saved
 check-post khatm hone ke kaaran hajaaron karod rupayon kii to bachat hui he
 The biggest savings have been time
 ek prakaar se uski tees pratishat Efficiency bad rahi he
 You can imagine what it means to increase thirty percent efficiency in the transport world of India
 ek GST ke kaaran itnaa bada parivartan aayaa he
 My dear countrymen, today money has come to banks due to demonetisation
 bank apni byaaj dar kam kar rahe hai
 The common man is getting money from the bank through currency
 saamaanya maanav ko apane pairon par khadey hone ke liye avasar mil rahaa he
 Be poor, a middle class person wants to build a house, then banks are coming forward to help him, coming at a lower rate of interest
 ye sara desh ke arthtantr ko gati dene kii disha main kaam kar rahaa he
 My dear countrymen, now is the time
 ham 21veen sadi main hai
 The largest youth group in the world is in our country
 duniya main hamaari pahchaan IT ke dwaara he, Digital World ke dwaara he
 Will we still remain in the same old thinking? are! ek jamaane main chamade ke sikke chalate the, dhire-dhire lupt ho gaye, koi poochne vaala nahin rahaa
 Today the paper notes are going to be converted into digital currency all the time
 ham netritv karen, ham jimmevary len, ham Digital Transaction kii ore jaaen
 We adopt BHIM APP, become part of economic business
 ham Prepaid ke dwaara bhi kaam karen
 And i am happy that Digital transactions have grown
 pichley saal ke mukaable usamen 34 pratishat kaa ijapha hua he or Prepaid bhugtan main kareeb 44 pratishat kaa
 And that's why we should go ahead with a low cash economy
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, sarkaar kii kuch yojanaayen aisi hai, jo hindustan ke saamaanya maanav kii jeb main paise bachaa saken
 If you put an LED bulb, then a thousand rupees two thousand five thousand rupees of the year are going to save you
 agar aap svachh bharat main safal hote hai, to garib kaa saat hajaar kaa rupaya dawaai kaa band hota he
 Controlling inflation has been successful in curbing your rising expenses, in a way your savings
 ‘jan aushadhi kendron’ ke dwaara sasti dawaai kii dukaan garib ke liye ek bahut bada aashirwad bani he
 The expenses that were behind our operation, behind the stent, have come down
 aane vaale dinon main Knee ke Operation ke liye bhi sari suvidhaayen milengi
 Our effort is to reduce these expenses for the poor and middle class human beings and for that we are taking steps one after the other
 pehle hamaare desh main rajyon ke mukhyalay main Dialysis hua karata tha
 We decided to deliver dialysis to the district centers of India
 kareeb saadhe teen sau, chaar sau jilon tak pahunchaa diya or muft main Dialysis karke garib kii jindagi bachaane kaa kaam ham kar rahe hai
 Today the country can be proud that we have developed our systems in front of the world
 GPS System ke dwaara NAVIC Navigation kii vyavastha aaj karne main ham safal hue hai
 Through SAARC Satellite, we have successfully campaigned to help with neighboring countries

 The 'BHIM-AADHAR App' is a wonder within the world for Digital Transaction

 In India, rupay Card is worth crores
 or agar wo operational ho jayega, wo agar garibon ke jeb main he, to duniya kaa, ye sabase bada ho jayega
 And that's why my dear countrymen, i request you to move ahead by taking a pledge for 'new India', and do it in time
 hamaare yahaan shastron main kaha gaya haih aniyat kaal:, aniyat kaalah prabhutayo viplavante, prabhutayo viplavante
 If a task is not completed at the right time, then the desired result is never achieved
 or isaliye ‘team India’ ke liye, sava sau karod deshavaasiyon kii team India ke liye, aaj hamen sankalp lenaa hoga 2022 tak ‘new India’ banane kaa or ye kaam ham khud karenge, koi karegaa aisa nahin, ham khud karenge
 Will do for the country, will do better than before, will do more than before, will do it with dedication, in 2022 to see 'grand-divine' Hindustan
 or isaliye ham sab milakar ke ek aisa bharat banaaenge jahaan garib ke paas pakkaa ghar ho, bijli ho, pani ho

 And therefore my dear countrymen, we will all try to work together in this race of development
 aaj aazaadee ke 70 saal ke baad, aazaadee ke 75 saal kii pratiksha ke bich paanch saal ke mahatvapurn kaarykaal main ek ‘divya-bhavy bharat’ ke sapane ko lekar ke ham sabhi deshvasi chalem, isi ek bhav ke saath main phir ek baar aazaadee ke diwaanon ko pranaam karata hum
 i salute the new faith, new zeal of 1
25 billion countrymen
 or nae sankalp ke saath aage chalane ke liye ‘team India’ ko aahvaan karata hum
 With this feeling, my heartiest greetings to all of you
 bharat mata kii jai, vande maataram jai hind
 Jai Hind, Jai Hind, Jai Hind, Jai Hind

 Vande Mataram, Vande Mataram, Vande Mataram, Vande Mataram
 tippaniyan Thank you very much to all
 saabhaar: PIB My dear countrymen, sometimes in the name of faith, some people, in the absence of patience, do such things which disintegrate the fabric of society
 desh shanti, sadbhaavna or ekta se chalata he
 The poison of casteism, the poison of communalism, can never benefit the country
 ye to gandhi kii bhoomi he, buddha kii bhoomi he, sabko saath le karke chalanaa; ye is desh kii samskruti or parampara kaa hissaa he
 We have to carry it forward successfully, and hence violence cannot be stressed in the name of faith
 aspataal main to patient ke saath kuch ho jaae, aspataal jala diya jaae; aksmaat ho jaae, gaadiyaan jala diya jaaen; andolan karen, sarkari sampatti ko jala diya jaae; aaazaad hindustan ke liye ye kiskaa he? hamaare sava sau karod deshavaasiyon kii sampatti he
 Whose cultural heritage is this? This is the cultural heritage of 1
25 billion countrymen
 ye aasthaa kiski he? ham sava sau karod deshavaasiyon kii aasthaa he; or isliye aasthaa ke naam par hinsa kaa rasta, is desh main kabhi bhi chal nahin saktaa, yah desh kabhi sweekaar nahin kar saktaa he
 And so i will urge the countrymen, at that time there was the slogan 'quit India', today the slogan is 'add India'
 vyakti-vyakti ko hamane saath lenaa he, jan-jan ko saath lenaa he, samaaj ke har tabake ko saath lenaa he, or usee ko le karke hamen desh ko aage badhanaa he
 We need a strong economy to build a prosperous India
 santulit vikaas chahie, next generation infrastructure chahie, tab ja kar ke hamaare sapanom ke bharat ko ham apni ankhon ke saamne dekh sakate hai
 Brothers and sisters, we have taken countless decisions in three years
 kuch chizon ko notice kiya gaya he or kuch chijen shaayad notice main nahin ai
 But one thing is important
 jab aap itnaa bada badlaav karte he to rukvaaten aati hai, gati ruk jaati he
 But see the working style of this government, if the train also passes near a railway station, when the track changes, the speed running from 60 has to be brought to the speed of 30
 trek badalane par train kii speed kam ho jaati he
 We are trying to take the whole country to a new track, but we have not let his speed down, we have kept his pace
 chaahe GST laaen ho, koi bhi kanoon laaen ho, koi bhi nai vyavastha laae ho, ham usko karne main safal hue he or aage bhi isko ham karenge
 We have laid emphasis on infrastructure
 abhootpurv kharch infrastructure par die ja rahe hai
 The railway station should be modernized, in a small town, whether to build an airport, whether to arrange water-way, whether to arrange roadways, whether to build gas grid, whether to grid water, whether to do optical fiber network , We are giving full emphasis on all types of modern infrastructure
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, 21veen sadi main bharat ko aage badhaane kaa sabase urjavan kshetra he, hamaara purvi hindustan
 There is so much potential, powerful human resource, immense natural wealth, rich of hard work, and ability to change life by resolving
 hamaara puraa dhyaan purvi uttar pradesh, bihar, bengal, assam, north east, odisha, ye hamaare aise samarthyavan rajya hai, jahaan prakritik sampada bharpoor he, usko aage badhaakar ke desh ko ek nai oonchai par le jane kii disha main ham prayatnrat he
 Brothers and sisters, corruption-free India is a very important task, we are trying to strengthen it
 sarkaar banane ke baad pehla kaam kiya tha SIT banane kaa
 Today, after three years, i want to tell the countrymen, proudly tell them that within three years, we have discovered more than about 1
25 lakh crore rupees of black money, caught it and suurender it
 Is forced
 uske baad hamane notebandi kaa faisla kiya
 We have achieved many significant successes through demonetisation
 jo kalaadhan chipa hua tha, usko mukhyadhara main aana padaa
 You must have seen that we sometimes used to extend 07 days-10 days-15 days, sometimes at the petrol pump, sometimes at the drugstore, sometimes at the railway station, we continued to take old notes, because our effort was once Money should also become a part of the formal economy in the banks and we have successfully completed that work
 or iskaa kaaran yah hua he ki abhi jo research hua he, kareeb teen lakh karod rupye
 
 
 This government has not done research, outside experts have done it
 notebandi ke baad teen lakh karod rupye, jo atirikt, jo kabhi banking system main waapas nahin aata tha wo aayaa he
 More than a quarter of a million rupees in the amount deposited in banks is under suspicion
 kam se kam do lakh karod rupye se zyada kalaadhan usko bainko tak pahunchnaa padaa he or ab vyavastha ke saath unako apana jawaab dene ke liye majaboor hue hai
 The new black money has also come to a great halt
 is varsh, iskaa parinaam dekhie, 01 april se 05 agast tak income tax return daakhil karne vaale nae vyaktigat karadaataaon kii sankhya 56 lakh
 In the same period last year, this number was only 2
2 million
 Double se bhi zyada! ye kaaran kaledhan ke khilaaf hamaari ladaai kaa parinaam he
 More than 18 lakh people have been identified, whose income is more than the book according to them, they are uncountable and hence they have to answer this difference
 saadhe chaar lakh log isamen se ab maidan main aaye hai, apni galati sweekaar karke raste main aane kaa prayaas kar rahe hai
 One lakh people have come forward, who had never heard of income tax in life, nor had ever given income tax, nor had they thought of it, but today they have to do it
 bhaaiyon bahanon, hamaare desh main agar do chaar companiyaan bhi kahin band ho jaae, to choubison ghante us par charchaaen hoti hai us par Debates hoti hai
 Economy is over


 it is done, no matter what happens! You'd be surprised to know, black money traders, Shell used to run companies and after demonetisation when data-mining was done
 tab teen lakh aisi companiyaan pai gayi hai, jo sirf or sirf shell companiyaan hai
 Does hawala business
 teen lakh, koi kalpana kar saktaa he
 And we have canceled the registration of one and a half lakh from that
 paanch companiyaan band ho jaae to hindustan main tufaan much jaataa he
 Locked up to twenty two lakh companies
 desh kaa maal luutane waalon ko jawaab dena padegaa, ye kaam hamane kar ke dikhaaya
 You will be surprised! Some shell companies are such that four hundred and four hundred companies were running at the same address, brothers and sisters
 chaar sau chaar sau companiyaan chal rahi thim
 Nobody was going to see, nobody was going to ask
 sari mileebhagat chal rahi thi
 And so my brothers and sisters, i have waged a very big fight against corruption black money
 desh kii bhalaai ke liye desh ke garibon ke kalyaan ke liye, desh ke naujavaanon ke bhavishya ko banane ke liye
 Brothers and sisters, one step after the other, and i am sure it will increase further after GST
 or Transparency aane vaali he
 Transportation alone Our truck used to go from one place to another
 ye GST ke baad tees pratishat uskaa samay batch gaya he
 Thousands of crores of rupees have been saved due to the end of check-post
 sabase badi bachat samay kii hui he
 In a way, its thirty percent efficiency is increasing
 aap kalpana kar sakate hai hindustan ke Transport jagat main tees pratishat Efficiency badhane kaa matlab kya hota he
 a GST has brought about such a big change
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, aaj notebandi ke kaaran bainko ke paas dhan aayaa he
 Banks are reducing their interest rate
 mudra ke dwaara saamaanya maanav ko bank se paisa mil rahaa he
 The common man is getting an opportunity to stand on his feet
 garib ho, madhyavarg kaa vyakti ho ghar bananaa chahta he, to bank usko madad karne ke liye aage aa rahe hai, kam byaaj kii dar se aage aa rahe hai
 It is working towards accelerating the economy of the country
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, ab ye vakt badal chukaa he
 We are in the 21st century
 vishwa kaa sabase bada yuva varg hamaare desh main he
 Our identity in the world is by IT, by Digital World
 kya ab bhi ham usee pooraani soch main rahenge
 Hey! Once upon a time, leather coins used to move, slowly disappeared, no one was asking
 aaj jo kaagaj ke note hai, samay aate rahete wo sara kaa sara Digital Currency main Convert hone vaala he
 Let us lead, let us take responsibility, let us go towards Digital Transaction
 ham BHIM APP ko apanaaen, aarthik kaarobaar kaa hissaa banaaen
 We also work through Prepaid
 or mujhe khushi he ki Digital lenden badi he
 It has increased by 34 percent over the previous year and about 44 percent in prepaid payments
 or isaliye kam cash vaali arthvyavastha, usko lekar ke hamen aage badhanaa chahie
 My dear countrymen, there are some schemes of the government that can save money in the pockets of the common man of India
 agar aap LED Bulb lagaate hai, to saal bhar kaa hajaar do hajaar paanch hajaar rupaya aapkaa bachane vaala he
 If you succeed in a clean India, then the poor's medicine of seven thousand rupees stops
 mahangaai par niyantran, aapke badhate hue kharch ko rokane main safal hua he, ek prakaar se aapaki bachat he
 Affordable medicine shops have become a huge blessing for the poor through 'jan Aushadhi Kendras'
 hamaare yahaan Operation ke peeche, stent ke peeche jo kharch hote the wo kam hue hai
 In the coming days, all facilities will also be available for Knee's operation
 hamaari koshish he ki garib or madhyamvarg ke maanav ke liye ye kharch kam ho or uske liye ham ek ke baad ek kadam uthaa rahe hai
 Earlier, dialysis used to take place in the headquarters of the states in our country
 hamane tay kiya hindustan ke jila kendron tak Dialysis pahunchaayenge
 Nearly three and a half hundred and four hundred districts have been reached and by dialysis for free, we are working to save the life of the poor
 aaj desh garv kar saktaa he ki hamane vishwa ke saamne apni vyavasthaaon ko viksit kiya he
 Today we have succeeded in arranging NAVIC Navigation through GPS System
 hamane SAARC Satellite ke dwaara hamane padosi deshon ke saath madad karne kaa safal abhiyaan kiya he
 We are delivering our importance inside the world today by 'tejas' airplane
 ‘BHIM-AADHAR App’ duniya ke andar Digital Transaction ke liye ek ajooba bana hua he
 rupay Card
 
 
 hindustan main rupay Card karodon kii taadaad main he
 And if it becomes operational, if it is in the pocket of the poor, then it will become the largest in the world
 or isaliye mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, meraa aapse yahi aagrah he ki ham ‘new India’ kaa sankalp le kar ke aage badhen, samay rahete hue karen
 It is said in our scriptures: Aniyat Kaal: Aniyat Kaal: Prabhutyo Viplavante, Prabhutayo Viplavante
 sahi samay par agar koi kaary puraa nahin kiya gaya, to phir icchit parinaam kabhi nahin milte hai
 And so for 'team India', for Team India of 1
25 billion countrymen, today we have to pledge to make 'new India' by 2022 and we will do this work ourselves, no one will do it, we will do it ourselves
 desh ke liye karenge, pehle se acha karenge, pehle se zyada karenge, samarpan bhav se karenge, 2022 main ‘bhavy-divya’ hindustan dekhne ke liye karenge
 And that's why we will all together create an India where the poor have a pucca house, electricity, water
 ham sab milakar ek aisa bharat banaaenge, jahaan desh kaa kisaan chintaa main nahin chaiyn se soyega
 By 2022, he will earn twice as much as he is earning today
 ham sab milakar ke ek aisa hindustan banaaenge, jahaan yuvaaon, mahilaon ko apane sapane puure karne ke liye bharpoor avasar uplabdh honge
 Together we will create an India that will be free from terrorism, communalism and casteism
 ham sab milakar ke ek aisa bharat banaaenge, jahaan bhrashtachar or bhai-bhatijawad se koi samjhauta nahin hoga
 Together we will create an India that will be clean, healthy and fulfill the dream of Swaraj
 or isaliye mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, ham sab milakar ke vikaas kii is daud main aage chalane kaa prayaas karenge
 Today, after 70 years of independence, in the midst of waiting for 75 years of independence, in the important tenure of five years, all of us countrymen should go with the dream of a 'divine-grand India', with this same sentiment i once again i bow to the crazy people
 sava sau karod deshavaasiyon ke nae vishwaas, nai umang ko naman karata hum
 And call upon 'team India' to move forward with a new resolution
 isi bhaavana ke saath aap sabko hriday se meri bahut bahut shubhakamanaayen
 Bharat Mata Ki Jai, Vande Mataram Jai Hind
 jai hind, jai hind, jai hind, jai hind
 Bharat Mata Ki Jai, Bharat Mata Ki Jai, Bharat Mata Ki Jai
 vande maataram, vande maataram, vande maataram, vande maataram
 The comments sabhi kaa bahut bahut dhanyavad
 Sincerely: PIB aspataal main to patient ke saath kuch ho jaae, aspataal jala diya jaae; aksmaat ho jaae, gaadiyaan jala diya jaaen; andolan karen, sarkari sampatti ko jala diya jaae; aaazaad hindustan ke liye ye kiskaa he? hamaare sava sau karod deshavaasiyon kii sampatti he
 Whose cultural heritage is this? This is the cultural heritage of 1
25 billion countrymen
 ye aasthaa kiski he? ham sava sau karod deshavaasiyon kii aasthaa he; or isliye aasthaa ke naam par hinsa kaa rasta, is desh main kabhi bhi chal nahin saktaa, yah desh kabhi sweekaar nahin kar saktaa he
 And so i will urge the countrymen, at that time there was the slogan 'quit India', today the slogan is 'add India'
 vyakti-vyakti ko hamane saath lenaa he, jan-jan ko saath lenaa he, samaaj ke har tabake ko saath lenaa he, or usee ko le karke hamen desh ko aage badhanaa he
 We need a strong economy to build a prosperous India
 santulit vikaas chahie, next generation infrastructure chahie, tab ja kar ke hamaare sapanom ke bharat ko ham apni ankhon ke saamne dekh sakate hai
 Brothers and sisters, we have taken countless decisions in three years
 kuch chizon ko notice kiya gaya he or kuch chijen shaayad notice main nahin ai
 But one thing is important
 jab aap itnaa bada badlaav karte he to rukvaaten aati hai, gati ruk jaati he
 But see the working style of this government, if the train also passes near a railway station, when the track changes, the speed running from 60 has to be brought to the speed of 30
 trek badalane par train kii speed kam ho jaati he
 We are trying to take the whole country to a new track, but we have not let his speed down, we have kept his pace
 chaahe GST laaen ho, koi bhi kanoon laaen ho, koi bhi nai vyavastha laae ho, ham usko karne main safal hue he or aage bhi isko ham karenge
 We have laid emphasis on infrastructure
 abhootpurv kharch infrastructure par die ja rahe hai
 The railway station should be modernized, in a small town, whether to build an airport, whether to arrange water-way, whether to arrange roadways, whether to build gas grid, whether to grid water, whether to do optical fiber network , We are giving full emphasis on all types of modern infrastructure
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, 21veen sadi main bharat ko aage badhaane kaa sabase urjavan kshetra he, hamaara purvi hindustan
 There is so much potential, powerful human resource, immense natural wealth, rich of hard work, and ability to change life by resolving
 hamaara puraa dhyaan purvi uttar pradesh, bihar, bengal, assam, north east, odisha, ye hamaare aise samarthyavan rajya hai, jahaan prakritik sampada bharpoor he, usko aage badhaakar ke desh ko ek nai oonchai par le jane kii disha main ham prayatnrat he
 Brothers and sisters, corruption-free India is a very important task, we are trying to strengthen it
 sarkaar banane ke baad pehla kaam kiya tha SIT banane kaa
 Today, after three years, i want to tell the countrymen, proudly tell them that within three years, we have discovered more than about 1
25 lakh crore rupees of black money, caught it and suurender it
 Is forced
 uske baad hamane notebandi kaa faisla kiya
 We have achieved many significant successes through demonetisation
 jo kalaadhan chipa hua tha, usko mukhyadhara main aana padaa
 You must have seen that we sometimes used to extend 07 days-10 days-15 days, sometimes at the petrol pump, sometimes at the drugstore, sometimes at the railway station, we continued to take old notes, because our effort was once Money should also become a part of the formal economy in the banks and we have successfully completed that work
 or iskaa kaaran yah hua he ki abhi jo research hua he, kareeb teen lakh karod rupye
 
 
 This government has not done research, outside experts have done it
 notebandi ke baad teen lakh karod rupye, jo atirikt, jo kabhi banking system main waapas nahin aata tha wo aayaa he
 More than a quarter of a million rupees in the amount deposited in banks is under suspicion
 kam se kam do lakh karod rupye se zyada kalaadhan usko bainko tak pahunchnaa padaa he or ab vyavastha ke saath unako apana jawaab dene ke liye majaboor hue hai
 The new black money has also come to a great halt
 is varsh, iskaa parinaam dekhie, 01 april se 05 agast tak income tax return daakhil karne vaale nae vyaktigat karadaataaon kii sankhya 56 lakh
 In the same period last year, this number was only 2
2 million
 Double se bhi zyada! ye kaaran kaledhan ke khilaaf hamaari ladaai kaa parinaam he
 More than 18 lakh people have been identified, whose income is more than the book according to them, they are uncountable and hence they have to answer this difference
 saadhe chaar lakh log isamen se ab maidan main aaye hai, apni galati sweekaar karke raste main aane kaa prayaas kar rahe hai
 One lakh people have come forward, who had never heard of income tax in life, nor had ever given income tax, nor had they thought of it, but today they have to do it
 bhaaiyon bahanon, hamaare desh main agar do chaar companiyaan bhi kahin band ho jaae, to choubison ghante us par charchaaen hoti hai us par Debates hoti hai
 Economy is over


 it is done, no matter what happens! You'd be surprised to know, black money traders, Shell used to run companies and after demonetisation when data-mining was done
 tab teen lakh aisi companiyaan pai gayi hai, jo sirf or sirf shell companiyaan hai
 Does hawala business
 teen lakh, koi kalpana kar saktaa he
 And we have canceled the registration of one and a half lakh from that
 paanch companiyaan band ho jaae to hindustan main tufaan much jaataa he
 Locked up to twenty two lakh companies
 desh kaa maal luutane waalon ko jawaab dena padegaa, ye kaam hamane kar ke dikhaaya
 You will be surprised! Some shell companies are such that four hundred and four hundred companies were running at the same address, brothers and sisters
 chaar sau chaar sau companiyaan chal rahi thim
 Nobody was going to see, nobody was going to ask
 sari mileebhagat chal rahi thi
 And so my brothers and sisters, i have waged a very big fight against corruption black money
 desh kii bhalaai ke liye desh ke garibon ke kalyaan ke liye, desh ke naujavaanon ke bhavishya ko banane ke liye
 Brothers and sisters, one step after the other, and i am sure it will increase further after GST
 or Transparency aane vaali he
 Transportation alone Our truck used to go from one place to another
 ye GST ke baad tees pratishat uskaa samay batch gaya he
 Thousands of crores of rupees have been saved due to the end of check-post
 sabase badi bachat samay kii hui he
 In a way, its thirty percent efficiency is increasing
 aap kalpana kar sakate hai hindustan ke Transport jagat main tees pratishat Efficiency badhane kaa matlab kya hota he
 a GST has brought about such a big change
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, aaj notebandi ke kaaran bainko ke paas dhan aayaa he
 Banks are reducing their interest rate
 mudra ke dwaara saamaanya maanav ko bank se paisa mil rahaa he
 The common man is getting an opportunity to stand on his feet
 garib ho, madhyavarg kaa vyakti ho ghar bananaa chahta he, to bank usko madad karne ke liye aage aa rahe hai, kam byaaj kii dar se aage aa rahe hai
 It is working towards accelerating the economy of the country
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, ab ye vakt badal chukaa he
 We are in the 21st century
 vishwa kaa sabase bada yuva varg hamaare desh main he
 Our identity in the world is by IT, by Digital World
 kya ab bhi ham usee pooraani soch main rahenge
 Hey! Once upon a time, leather coins used to move, slowly disappeared, no one was asking
 aaj jo kaagaj ke note hai, samay aate rahete wo sara kaa sara Digital Currency main Convert hone vaala he
 Let us lead, let us take responsibility, let us go towards Digital Transaction
 ham BHIM APP ko apanaaen, aarthik kaarobaar kaa hissaa banaaen
 We also work through Prepaid
 or mujhe khushi he ki Digital lenden badi he
 It has increased by 34 percent over the previous year and about 44 percent in prepaid payments
 or isaliye kam cash vaali arthvyavastha, usko lekar ke hamen aage badhanaa chahie
 My dear countrymen, there are some schemes of the government that can save money in the pockets of the common man of India
 agar aap LED Bulb lagaate hai, to saal bhar kaa hajaar do hajaar paanch hajaar rupaya aapkaa bachane vaala he
 If you succeed in a clean India, then the poor's medicine of seven thousand rupees stops
 mahangaai par niyantran, aapke badhate hue kharch ko rokane main safal hua he, ek prakaar se aapaki bachat he
 Affordable medicine shops have become a huge blessing for the poor through 'jan Aushadhi Kendras'
 hamaare yahaan Operation ke peeche, stent ke peeche jo kharch hote the wo kam hue hai
 In the coming days, all facilities will also be available for Knee's operation
 hamaari koshish he ki garib or madhyamvarg ke maanav ke liye ye kharch kam ho or uske liye ham ek ke baad ek kadam uthaa rahe hai
 Earlier, dialysis used to take place in the headquarters of the states in our country
 hamane tay kiya hindustan ke jila kendron tak Dialysis pahunchaayenge
 Nearly three and a half hundred and four hundred districts have been reached and by dialysis for free, we are working to save the life of the poor
 aaj desh garv kar saktaa he ki hamane vishwa ke saamne apni vyavasthaaon ko viksit kiya he
 Today we have succeeded in arranging NAVIC Navigation through GPS System
 hamane SAARC Satellite ke dwaara hamane padosi deshon ke saath madad karne kaa safal abhiyaan kiya he
 We are delivering our importance inside the world today by 'tejas' airplane
 ‘BHIM-AADHAR App’ duniya ke andar Digital Transaction ke liye ek ajooba bana hua he
 rupay Card
 
 
 hindustan main rupay Card karodon kii taadaad main he
 And if it becomes operational, if it is in the pocket of the poor, then it will become the largest in the world
 or isaliye mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, meraa aapse yahi aagrah he ki ham ‘new India’ kaa sankalp le kar ke aage badhen, samay rahete hue karen
 It is said in our scriptures: Aniyat Kaal: Aniyat Kaal: Prabhutyo Viplavante, Prabhutayo Viplavante

 The comments sabhi kaa bahut bahut dhanyavad
 Sincerely: PIB samrudh bharat banane ke liye hamaari majboot arthvyavastha chahie
 We need balanced development, next generation infrastructure, then we can see the India of our dreams in front of our eyes
 bhaaiyo-bahanon, anginat nirnay hamane teen saal main liye
 Some things have been noted and some things may not have come into notice
 lekin ek baat mahatvapurn he
 When you make such a big change, the stops come, the speed stops
 lekin is sarkaar kii kaaryastylee dekhie, agar train bhi kisi railway stesan ke paas se guzarati he, jab trek badalati he to 60 se chalane vaali speed ko usko 30 kii speed main laana padataa he
 The speed of the train decreases by changing the track
 ham puure desh ko ek nae trek par le jane kaa prayaas kar rahe hai, lekin hamane uski speed kam nahin hone di he, hamane uski gati ko barkaraar rakhaa he
 Whether we bring GST, any law, any new system, we have succeeded in doing that and we will do it in future
 hamane infrastructure par bal diya he
 Unprecedented expenses are being given on infrastructure
 railway stesan kaa aadhunikeekaran ho, chote shahar main, chaahe airport bananaa ho, chaahe water-way kii vyavastha kerani ho, chaahe roadways kii vyavastha kerani ho, chaahe gas grid banani ho, chaahe pani kii grid karaani ho, chaahe optical fibre network karnaa ho, har prakaar ke aadhunik infrastructure par ham purna bal de rahe hai
 My dear countrymen, our eastern India is the most energetic field to advance India in the 21st century
 itnaa potential he, samarthyavan maanav sansaadhan he, apaar prakritik sampada he, parishram ke dhani hai, sankalp karke jindagi badalane kaa samarthy rakhte hai
 Our entire focus is on eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Bengal, Assam, North East, Odisha, these are our powerful states, where natural wealth is abundant, we are trying to take the country to a new height by taking it forward
 bhaaiyo-bahanon, bhrashtachar mukt bharat ek bada ahm kaam he, usko ham bal dene kaa prayaas kar rahe he
 After the formation of the government, the first task was to create SIT
 aaj teen saal ke baad main deshavaasiyon ko bataanaa chahta hum, garv se bataanaa chahta hum ki teen saal ke bheetar-bheetar, kareeb-kareeb sava lakh karod rupye se bhi zyada kalaadhan ko hamane khoj diya he, usko pakadaa he or usko suurender karne ke liye majaboor kiya he
 After that we decided to demonetise
 notebandi ke dwaara hamane anek mahatvapurn safaltaaen praapt kii hai
 The black money that was hidden had to come into the mainstream
 aapane dekha hoga ki ham kabhi 07 din-10 din-15 din badhaate jate the, kabhi petrol pump par, kabhi dawaai kii dukaan par, kabhi railway stesan par puraane note lene kaa silsilaa jari rakhte the, kyonki hamaara prayaas tha ki ek baar jo bhi dhan aae wo bainkon main formal economy kaa hissaa ban jaae or us kaam ko hamane safaltaapurvak paar kiya he
 And the reason for this is that the research that has been done now, is about three lakh crore rupees
 
 
 ye sarkaar ne research nahin kii he, baahar ke expert ne kii he
 Three lakh crore rupees after demonetisation, the additional, which never came back in the banking system, has come
 bainkon main jamaa kii gai raashi main paune do lakh karod se adhik raashi shaq ke ghere main he
 At least two lakh crore rupees of black money has had to reach the banks and now they are forced to give their answers with the system
 nae kaledhan par bhi bahut badi rukaawat aa gai he
 This year, see the result, 56 lakh new taxpayers filing income tax returns from 01 April to 05 August
 pichley saal usee avadhi main ye sankhya sirf 22 lakh thi
 More than double! These reasons are the result of our fight against black money
 18 lakh se zyada aise logon ko pahchaan liya gaya he, jinaki aay unke hisaab kitaab se kuch zyada he, beshumaar zyada he or isaliye is antar kaa unako jawaab dena pad rahaa he
 Out of this, four and a half lakh people have now come to the field, accepting their mistake and trying to get in the way
 ek lakh log aise saamne aae hai, jinhone kabhi jindagi main Income Tax kaa naam bhi nahin suna tha, na Income Tax kabhi diya tha, na kabhi unhone us par sochaa tha, lekin aaj unako wo karnaa pad rahaa he
 Brothers and sisters, if two or four companies are shut down in our country, then there are discussions on them round the clock
 arthniti khatm ho gai


 ye ho gaya, na jane kya kya hota he! aapako jaanakar ke hairaani hogi, kaale dhan ke kaarobaari, Shell companiyaan chalaate the or notebandi ke baad jab data-mining kiya gaya
 Then three lakh such companies have been found, which are just and shell companies only
 hawala kaa kaarobaar karti hai
 Three lakhs, one can imagine
 or usamen se paune do lakh kaa registration hamanen Cancel kar diya he
 If five companies are closed, then there is a storm in India
 paune do lakh companiyon ko taale laga diye
 Those who looted the goods of the country will have to answer, we did this by doing this
 aapako hairaani hogi! kuch to shell companiyaan aisi hai, jo ek hi Address par chaar sau chaar sau companiyaan chal rahi thim, bhaaiyon bahanon
 Four hundred and four hundred companies were operating
 koi dekhne vaala nahin tha, koi poochne vaala nahin tha
 All the collusion was going on
 or isaliye mere bhaaiyon bahanon, maine bhrashtachar kaale dhan ke khilaaf ek bahut badi ladaai chhedi he
 For the betterment of the country, for the welfare of the poor of the country, for the future of the youth of the country
 bhaaiyon bahanon, ek ke baad ek kadam or mujhe vishwaas he GST ke baad usamen or badhotaree hone vaali he
 And Transparency is forthcoming
 akele Transportation hamaara trek vaala ek sthaan se duusare sthaan par jaataa tha
 After this GST, thirty percent of his time is saved
 check-post khatm hone ke kaaran hajaaron karod rupayon kii to bachat hui he
 The biggest savings have been time
 ek prakaar se uski tees pratishat Efficiency bad rahi he
 You can imagine what it means to increase thirty percent efficiency in the transport world of India
 ek GST ke kaaran itnaa bada parivartan aayaa he
 My dear countrymen, today money has come to banks due to demonetisation
 bank apni byaaj dar kam kar rahe hai
 The common man is getting money from the bank through currency
 saamaanya maanav ko apane pairon par khadey hone ke liye avasar mil rahaa he
 Be poor, a middle class person wants to build a house, then banks are coming forward to help him, coming at a lower rate of interest
 ye sara desh ke arthtantr ko gati dene kii disha main kaam kar rahaa he
 My dear countrymen, now is the time
 ham 21veen sadi main hai
 The largest youth group in the world is in our country
 duniya main hamaari pahchaan IT ke dwaara he, Digital World ke dwaara he
 Will we still remain in the same old thinking? are! ek jamaane main chamade ke sikke chalate the, dhire-dhire lupt ho gaye, koi poochne vaala nahin rahaa
 Today the paper notes are going to be converted into digital currency all the time
 ham netritv karen, ham jimmevary len, ham Digital Transaction kii ore jaaen
 We adopt BHIM APP, become part of economic business
 ham Prepaid ke dwaara bhi kaam karen
 And i am happy that Digital transactions have grown
 pichley saal ke mukaable usamen 34 pratishat kaa ijapha hua he or Prepaid bhugtan main kareeb 44 pratishat kaa
 And that's why we should go ahead with a low cash economy
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, sarkaar kii kuch yojanaayen aisi hai, jo hindustan ke saamaanya maanav kii jeb main paise bachaa saken
 If you put an LED bulb, then a thousand rupees two thousand five thousand rupees of the year are going to save you
 agar aap svachh bharat main safal hote hai, to garib kaa saat hajaar kaa rupaya dawaai kaa band hota he
 Controlling inflation has been successful in curbing your rising expenses, in a way your savings
 ‘jan aushadhi kendron’ ke dwaara sasti dawaai kii dukaan garib ke liye ek bahut bada aashirwad bani he
 The expenses that were behind our operation, behind the stent, have come down
 aane vaale dinon main Knee ke Operation ke liye bhi sari suvidhaayen milengi
 Our effort is to reduce these expenses for the poor and middle class human beings and for that we are taking steps one after the other
 pehle hamaare desh main rajyon ke mukhyalay main Dialysis hua karata tha
 We decided to deliver dialysis to the district centers of India
 kareeb saadhe teen sau, chaar sau jilon tak pahunchaa diya or muft main Dialysis karke garib kii jindagi bachaane kaa kaam ham kar rahe hai
 Today the country can be proud that we have developed our systems in front of the world
 GPS System ke dwaara NAVIC Navigation kii vyavastha aaj karne main ham safal hue hai
 Through SAARC Satellite, we have successfully campaigned to help with neighboring countries
 ham ‘tejas’ hawaii jahaaj ke dwaara aaj duniya ke andar apni ahmiyat pahunchaa rahe hai
 The 'BHIM-AADHAR App' is a wonder within the world for Digital Transaction
 rupay Card 
 
 
 In India, rupay Card is worth crores
 or agar wo operational ho jayega, wo agar garibon ke jeb main he, to duniya kaa, ye sabase bada ho jayega
 And that's why my dear countrymen, i request you to move ahead by taking a pledge for 'new India', and do it in time
