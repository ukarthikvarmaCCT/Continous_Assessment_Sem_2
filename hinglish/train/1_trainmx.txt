badale main jab kiran bedi par enjio ke jariye bhrashtachar ke aarope lage, tab modi samarthak bhi chup rahe
 Since then, all the people who understand politics in Gujarat had come to know that Modi and Bedi are together
 lekin iske baavjood, jitna main modi ko samajhataa hum, itnaa kaaphi nahin he ki modi kisi ko mukhyamantri pad kii kursi ofer kar den
 Electoral mathematics has always dominated political friendship with him, and this time the same thing is the same
 modi or shah hameshaa se chunaavon ko bahut baariki se parakhte hai
 It has been the habit of both that they conduct their own surveys in every election related to them or their reputation, and do not rely too much on media poll surveys
 is baar bhi unhone zarur andruni surveykshan karavaaya hoga or shaayad vah media main aa rahe surveykshanon ke nazadik hoga
 That is, Kejriwal must be giving a tough fight to the BJP
 dilli main jeet kii raah utani aasaan nahin hogi, isiilie apane kaaryakartaaon kii naaraazgi kii keemat par bhi kuch extra push kii zarurat mahasoos hui hogi
 Narendra Modi has been getting more votes than expected in Gujarat and Lok Sabha elections, because he has been the first choice of people for the post of Chief Minister or Prime Minister, and even though the BJP is getting more seats in Delhi, but in the race for Chief Minister Kejriwal has been at the forefront and that is the reason why Modi and Shah must have had a fear that this factor will be given to the Aam Aadmi Party at the last minute Do not bring competition
 or yah bhi sach he ki raajnneeti main aap bhale hi 10 chunaav jeeten, lekin ek haar, or aapaki lokapriyata par asar padana shuru ho jaataa he
 If BJP does not win in Delhi, then it will begin to discuss that Modi's charisma has started to wane, which will be a very heartbreaking moment for both Modi and Shah
 isiilie kuch aisa karnaa tha, jisase ek majboot baazi lagaai jaae, or jo factor sabase badi kamazori he, use durust kar liya jaae
 Compared to the popularity of Arvind Kejriwal's Chief Minister's post, no such Chief Ministerial candidate, which even the common people feel, is in competition
 
 
 
 And just because of this, a decision was taken by making people angry
 
 
 modi ne chunaa bedi ko
 
 
 So, now we have to see how successful this math of Modi is

 There was a terrorist attack on Parliament on this day 15 years ago
 us din ek safed ambesder car main aae paanch aatankwaadiyon ne 45 minute main loktantr ke sabase bade mandir ko goliyon se chalni karke puure hindustan ko jhakzor diya tha
 We are going to tell you the full story of the attack on Parliament minute by minute: Date - December 13, 2001 - 11 am 28 minutes Place - Parliament House, Delhi The enthusiasts of the winter session were fast
 vipaksh ke jabardast hangaame ke baad donon sadanon kii kaarywahi 40 minute ke liye sthagit kii ja chuki thi
 As soon as the house was adjourned, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Leader of the Opposition Sonia Gandhi left the Lok Sabha and traveled to their official residence
 bahut se saansad bhi vahaan se ja chuke the
 But Home Minister LK Advani, along with many of his fellow ministers and about 200 mps, was still present in the Lok Sabha
 hameshaa kii tarah loksabhaa parisar ke andar media kaa bhi puraa jamaavada maujuud tha tab tak bahut se saansad or mantri bhi sadan ke andar se baahar nikal aae the or gunguni dhoop kaa majaa le rahe the
 Time - 11 o'clock in the morning - Place No
 11 of Parliament House - Security guards posted in Vice President Krishnakant Sharma's car convoy were now waiting for him to come out of the House
 or thik usee pal, ek safed ambesder car tezi se up raashtrapati ke kafile kii taraf badhati he
 Its speed was much faster than the speed of trains coming inside the Parliament House
 koi kuch samaj hi paata ki car ke peeche loksabhaa ke suraksha karmchaaree jagadish yadav bhaagate najar aae
 He was constantly pointing to stop the car
 jagadish yadav ko yun betahasha bhaagate dekh uparashtrapati ke surakshakarmi eesai jeet ram, eesai nanak chand or eesai shyaam singh bhi ambesder car ko rokane kii koshish main uski taraf jhapatate hai
 Seeing the security personnel coming towards him, the driver of the ambassador car turns his car towards gate number one
 get number ek ke najadik hi up-raashtrapati kii car khadi thi
 The driver of the car loses control due to the high speed and turn and the vehicle collides directly with the Vice President's car
 samay-subah 11 bajkar 30 minatesthaan-get number 1, sansad bhavaubhi koi kuch samaj paata ki tabhi ambesder ke chaaron daravaaje ek saath khulte hai or gaadi main baithe paanch fidaayin palak jhapakate hi baahar nikalate hai or andhadhundh goliyaan barasaani shuru kar dete hai
 All five were equipped with ak-47s
 paanchon ke peeth or kandhe par bag the
 For the first time terror had crossed the threshold of democracy
 puraa sansad bhawan goliyon kii chhadtadaahat se gunj uthaa thai aatankwaadiyon ke pehle hamale kaa shikaar bane ve chaar surakshakarmi jo ambesder car ko rokane kii koshish kar rahe the
 But the rest of the people in the Parliament House still did not know what happened or what is happening
 goliyon kii aawaaj ko zyaadaatar log pataakhon kaa shor samaj rahe the
 No one had even slept in the air that terrorists could shout inside Parliament
 par phir tabhi goliyon kii tadatadaahat ke bich ek dhamaake kii aawaaj aati he
 After the echo of the bullets, the first blast had announced that the temple of the world's largest democracy, the Parliament House, has been attacked
 goliyon kii tadatadaahat or dhamaakon kii gunj ke bich surakshakarmiyon ko lahuluhaan jameen par girte dekh pal bhar main tasviir saaf ho chuki thi
 And now there was panic and panic all around inside the Parliament House
 jise jidhar jo konaa dikhaai de rahaa tha wo udhar hi bhaag rahaa tha
 Even now the loudest sound of gunfire was coming from the gate number 11
 paanchon aatankwaadi ab bhi ambesder car ke hi aas-paas se goliyaan or grenade barasaa rahe the
 Then, seeing the terrorists gathered towards Gate number 11, security personnel of Parliament House along with the Delhi Police and CRPF personnel move towards Gate Number 11
 ab donon taraf se golibari shuru ho chuki thi
 Home minister LK Advani, who was just a few hundred meters away from the firing, had also received news of the attack by then
 lihaaja laalkrishna adwani or raksha mantri jorge furnandis samet tamaam varisht mantriyon ko fouran sadan ke andar hi mahfuj jagahon par le jaaya gaya
 With this, all the doors leading to the house are also closed and security personnel take their positions there
 udhar duusari taraf suraksha karmiyon ko get number 11 kii taraf badhate dekh paanchon aatankwaadi bhi apni pojishan badalane lagate hai
 One of the five terrorists, now firing, now runs towards Gate No
 1
 jabaki baaki chaar get number 12 kii taraf badhane kii koshish karte hai
 The terrorists were somehow trying to reach the door of the house so that they could enter the house
 magar suraksha karmiyon ne pehle hi tamaam daravaajon ke ird-gird apni pojishan le rakhi thi
 Apart from this, the way the terrorists were running around in the fire, it seemed clear that they have entered but they do not know on which side the doors are for entering the house? Meanwhile, a terrorist who had moved towards Gate No
 1, proceeded through the corridor of the Parliament House to go inside the House with bullets
 lekin isse pehle ki wo apni koshish main kaamyaab hota use surakshabalon kii goli lag jaati he
 As soon as the bullet hits, he falls in the corridor close to gate number one, some distance away from the door
 pehla aatankwaadi gir chukaa tha
 But he was still alive
 surakshakarmi use puri tarah se nishane par lene ke baavjood uske kareeb jane se abhi bhi batch rahe the
 Because the fear was that he did not blow himself up
 or surakshakarmiyon kaa ye dar galat bhi nahin tha
 Because immediately after falling on the ground, when the terrorist felt that he was surrounded, he immediately pressed himself on the remote and blew himself up
 usne apane sharir par bam baandh rakhaa tha
 Four terrorists were still alive
 na sirf jinda the balki lagaataar bhaag-bhaag kar andhadhundh goliyaan barasaa rahe the
 It was as if they had come prepared to compete for hours
 kyonki unke paas goli, bam or grenade kaa puraa jakhira tha
 Which he had hidden in his body and brought in a shoulder bag
 ab tak enesji commando or sena ko bhi hamale kii khabar di ja chuki thi
 The team of Special Cell of Delhi Police, which specializes in dealing with terrorists, had also traveled to Parliament House
 par sansad bhawan main live oparation ab bhi jari tha
 The news of the attack through the news channel had now spread to India and abroad
 is bich shaayad baaki bache chaar aatankwaadiyon ko bhi apane ek saathi kii maut kii khabar lag chuki thi
 Perhaps he got this news from a blast that was carried out by a terrorist by remotely blowing himself up
 lihaaja baaki aatankwaadi ab or zyada ghabara gaye
 In panic, all the four terrorists started running here and there to find the hideout
 duusari taraf surakshakarmi ab chaaron taraf se aatankwaadiyon ko gherna shuru kar chuke the
 The firing was still on
 or phir isi dauraan get number paanch se ek or acchhee khabar ai
 Another terrorist was pelted with security personnel's bullets
 ab bache teen aatankwaadi
 All three knew very well that they could not escape from the Parliament House alive
 lihaaza unhone bhi sadan ke andar jane kii ek aakhri koshish kii
 They started slowly moving towards Gate No
 9, firing the bullets
 magar mustaid surakshakarmiyon ne unhen get number nau ke paas hi gher liya
 About 12 from time to day
 10 bajesthan-get number 9, sansad bhavaub puraa oparation get number 9 ke paas simat gaya tha
 There were continuous firing from both sides
 bich-bich main aatankwaadi surakshakarmiyon par hathgole bhi phenk rahe the
 But since they were surrounded all around, there was no way to escape now
 or aakhirkaar kuch der baad ek-ek kar teenon aatankwaadi dher ho chuke the

 Managing relationships is not easy
 anjaane main hi kabhi-kabhi ham apane saathi ko aisi chot panhucha dete hai jo rishton main duriyon kaa kaaran banane lagati hai
 Perhaps that is why it is said that keeping the relationship intact is no less than a challenge
 aap bhi chaahate honge ki aapke or aapke saathi ke bich sab kuch acchhee tarah chale or rishton main kabhi bhi koi daraar naa aae
 This can happen, but for this you also have to keep some things in mind
 saathi kii saraahna karen:aap jaanate hai ki aapke saathi aapse bahut pyaar karaten hai or aapkaa bahut khyal bhi rakhte hai
 Of course you also want them, but do you thank them for the small things that they do for you sincerely
 aap sochenge ki ab har baar bhi kya thanks bolnaa yaa phir aap soch sakate hai ki apano ko bhi kya thanks kahana
 But believe it has an effect
 ye choti- choti chijen aapke rishte ko or majboot banaaengi
 Do not test your partner: Do not test them just to know how much your partner wants you
 pyaar ko sabit karne ke liye koi bhi baat manvaanaa galat he
 If both of you are in love with each other, no matter what happens, they will care about you
 unhen parakhane ke liye bevajaah kii maang naa karen
 Showing more tantrums can also make your partner irritable 
 apni bhi galati maane:kisi bhi galati kaa puraa dosha apane saathi par naa madhen
 If you feel that even if you are a little right, then accept it
 aap donon ke masale main sirf saathi ko katghare main khadaa karnaa aasaan kaam he par isse unhe bahut dukh panhuchega
 Maybe they can break even with this
 vahiin agar aap bhi apni galati maanenge or pyaar se samajhaayenge to unhe acha lagegaa or wo khud ko akelaa nahin mahasoos karenge
 Remove the complaints: If you feel bad about your partner, do not keep quiet
 us maamle main khul kar baat karen
 Most people do not even allow the partner to realize that they have offended him
 akele rahane ke bajaae saathi se gile-shikave dur karen
 By ignoring your partner, you only make them sad, you also hurt yourself
 jarurat se zyada ummiden naa paalen:kya aap apane saathi se kuch zyada hi ummiden karte hai? kya aap ye bhi chaahate hai ki wo aapse kam ummiden rakhe? aapkaa rishta pati-patni kaa ho yaa garlfriend-bwoyfriend kaa, aapako ye haq nahin ki aap apane saathi ko kam ehmiyat dekar zyada kii ummid karen
 Therefore, maintain harmony in relationships
 saathi kii pasand kaa bhi rakhen khyal:kahin aapako har cheez apane man mutabik karne kii aadat to nahin! agar aap sirf apni pasand kii filmein dekh rahe hai, sirf apni pasand kii jagah par ghoomane yaa khaane ja rahe hai to thodaa sanbhal jaaen
 Your partner may enjoy these things with you in the beginning, but if you keep doing things in your own way, then gradually your partner may become irritable or it may be that they start to distance you
 in choti- choti baton kaa dhyaan rakhkar aap apane bikharate rishte ko sambhaal sakate hai or hameshaa apane saathi ke kareeb bane rah sakate hai
 Keep adding new colors to your relationships and make it so healthy and strong so that you can feel its sweetness for ages

 com / ez2qatoicn International Yoga Day is celebrated on 21 June worldwide
 bhartiya samskruti kii 5000 saal kii parampara main yogasana kaa kaaphi mahatv bataae gaye hai
 If you too are included in the list of people who often make excuses for not having time behind doing yoga, then start looking for another excuse for yourself now
 ji haa ab aap 5 minute main bhi khud ko feet rakh sakate hai
 Let us know 5 such postures that you can do anywhere anytime, easily by sitting on the chair
 twisting yoga-is yoga ko karne ke liye thodaa sa ghumkar apane sidhe haath ko ulte pair par rakhen or qamar main thodaa sa twist mahasoos karen
 While doing this, release the breath while filling it continuously
 yahi prakiya duusari taraf se bhi karen
 Relax the body after repeating this procedure on both sides
 uttanasana-log aksar apane pet or qamar ke paas jamaa charbi se pareshaan rahete hai
 Uttanasana is the best yogasana for such people
 is asana ko karne se aapke kandhe or haathon kii mansapeshiyaan majboot hoti hai
 To do this asana, sit upright on the chair
 baithne ke baad sabase pehle saanson ko andar khinchate hue neeche kii taraf jhuken or hatheliyon ko jameen par tikaa den
 While doing this your feet should not bend
 5 second tak isi sthiti main bane rahane ke baad saanson ko chhodte hue pehle vaali mudra main aa jaaen
 Repeat this process 10 times
 unguliyon or kalai ke liye yoga-is yoga main kursi par baithe-baithe apni kalaayiyon ko clock viz or anti-clock viz ghumaayenurdhv hastasana-is yogasana ko karne ke liye sabase pehle kursi par bilkul sidhaa baith jaaen
 Now while holding the breath in, keep both your hands up for 5 seconds
 iske baad saans chhodte hue haathon ko neeche laaen
 Repeat the same process 10 times
 aisa karte samay apni peeth or baaki sharir ko sidhaa rakhen
 By doing this Yogasana, the body gets flexibility and freshness
 kandhon ke liye yoga-is yoga main kisi kursi par sidhaa baith jaaen
 After this, rotate the shoulders with the shoulders and anti-clockwise
 uttar pradesh main ventilator par padi congress ko 2019 loksabhaa chunaav se pehle jinda karne ke liye party adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne apana sabase bada daanv chal diya he
 For this, Rahul has fielded two of his most special people Priyanka Gandhi and Geotiraditya Scindia
 rahul ye jaanate hai ki desh jeetna he to pehle upi jeetna hoga
 With Priyanka Gandhi stepping into politics, she has been given the responsibility of Purvanchal, while the charge of Western UP is on the shoulders of Jyotiraditya Scindia
 aise main sawaal he ki donon netaaon main se kiske saamne zyada badi chunauti he
 Give responsibility for 43 seats Scindia and 37 seats Priyanka says that out of total 80 Lok Sabha seats of Uttar Pradesh, if Lucknow considers Lucknow as the central point, then western UP has 43 Lok Sabha seats and Purvanchal 37 seats
 is tarah se jyotiraditya sindhiya ke jimme priyanka gandhi se zyada siten ai hai
 Apart from this, in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the Congress did not get a single seat in western UP
 jabaki congress ke khate main aane vaali do siten amethi or raibareli bhi purvanchal ke khate main hai
 Not only this, in the Lok Sabha elections this time, the SP-BSP alliance has also decided not to field its candidate in both these seats
 is elaan ne priyanka kii raah ko or bhi aasaan kar diya he
 UP new to Scindia, Priyanka is not new to Priyanka Gandhi, the political battleground of Uttar Pradesh already active
 1999 se priyanka raibareli or amethi main chunaav prachaar kii kaman sambhalati rahi hai
 Due to this, he has influence in the surrounding districts as well
 donon jilon ke sanghathan or kshetra ke logon se lagaataar sampark banaae rakhti hai
 Posters of 'priyanka lao-up Bachao' have been posted many times in the state
 vahiin, jyotiraditya sindhiya madhya pradesh kii siyasat main sakriy rahe hai, unke liye pashchim upi nayaa he
 There is neither much recognition from the party leaders nor any experience of this area
 2014 main purvanchal se zyada pashchim main behatarhaalanki, pichley loksabhaa chunaav ke nateezon par gaur karen to sindhiya se zyada priyanka ke liye chunauteepurn purvi uttar pradesh he
 Except for the Kushinagar and Pratapgarh Lok Sabha seats, the party could not contest a better election in any seat in Purvanchal
 jabaki purvi uttar pradesh main saharanpur, gajiabad, kanpur, dhaurhara, rampur jaisi siton par congress ek lakh se zyada vot paane main safal rahi thi
 Apart from this there were many seats where the party got close to one lakh votes
 jyotiraditya kaa muqabla akhilesh-maaya skikhilesh yadav or mayawati kaa sabase zyada aadhaar pashchim upi main he, kyonki donon netaa isi kshetra se aate hai
 These two parties have formed an alliance and it is believed that Chaudhary Ajit Singh's party RLD can also become a part of it
 aise main jatiy sameekaran ke lihaaj se gathbandhan kaa pallaa baari dikh rahaa he
 In this way, Scindia will have to compete with Akhilesh and Mayawati to strengthen the Congress ground
 priyanka gandhi kaa muqabla modi-yogi sevehin, purvi uttar pradesh bijepi kaa majboot garh mana jaataa he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi is an MP from Banaras and CM Yogi Adityanath comes from Gorakhpur
 iske alaava bijepi ke pradesh adhyaksh mahendranath pandeya bhi purvanchal se aate hai
 In this way Priyanka Gandhi will have to compete directly with modi-yogi
 haalanki ye ilaaka ek daur main congress kaa majboot garh rahaa he
 Leaders like Kamalapati Tripathi and Veer Bahadur Singh who have come from these areas have been cms from the Congress
 congress priyanka ke jariye purvanchal main brahmanon ko saadh kar apni naiya paar lagaana chaahati he
 In the west, there is less than three months left for the election of the winning candidate in the Lok Sabha
 aise main pashchimi upi main congress party ke andar jaan foonkane kii jimmedaari sindhiya ke kandhon par hogi or party ke liye jitau ummidavaaron kii talash karnaa bhi ek badi chunauti he
 Jitau candidates are not seen with the Congress in seats like Muzaffarnagar, Meerut, Kairana, Bijnor, Rampur, Sambhal, Amroha, Gautam Budh Nagar, Moradabad, Aligarh and Agra
 haalanki purvanchal main bhi aisi hi killat he, lekin priyanka gandhi ke aane ke baad jis tarah se party main utsaah dikh rahaa he, usase congress kii ye pareshaani dur ho sakati he

 spotboy kii report ke mutabik bhoomika gurung ne apane drimwork ko lekar kaha ki secred games main kaam karnaa unka sapana he
 In an interview, Bhumika shared her opinion about the Sacred Games web series
 unhone kaha, "aajkal ke shoj main bahut neudity or boldnes hoti he jisaki jarurat sho main nahin hoti
 Producers are only putting it to sell their content
 ""eemaandaaree se kahuun to jo web content hamaare paas he, usamen ham bahut behatar kar sakate hai
 But yes, this is not the case with every show, i really liked Sacred Games and Mirzapur which had some scenes (bold and nudity ones) but they justify the scene script
 "view this post on instagramand finally She accepted feeling lost and let happiness

 khayr, yah us sho or plateform par nirbhar karata he
 "talking about the role's workfront, he gained popularity from television's popular show Nimki Mukhiya
 isamen unhone nimaki kaa mukhya role nibhaayaa tha
 Now in its next season Nimki is seen in a changed style
 sho kaa naam bhi nimaki mukhiya se badalakar nimaki vidhayak kar diya gaya he
 Arun Jaitley speaks as much as Hindi as he does in English
 lekin is baar ke aam bajet ne yah sabit kar diya ki ve hinglish bhi umdaa bolte hai
 During the General Budget, the Finance Minister started a new language tradition
 ab aisi hybrid bhashaa bolne ke peeche unka makasad kya tha, yah to vahi jaane? lekin ise lekar kayaas khub lagaae ja rahe hai
 It is also being said that seeing the electoral response from the villages of Gujarat, Jaitley used Hindi in the language to woo the people of the villages as part of the strategy
 haalanki jetali ke bhaashan ke ek din pehle hi ‘anual global demokrasi index’ jari hua tha
 In this, India dropped from 32nd to number 42 in the list of 167 countries
 or bharat pehali baar demokrasi kii jagah hybrid demokrasi vaale deshon kii qatari main shaamil ho chukaa tha
 That is, Jaitley's language became hybrid here and Bharat Hybrid Democratic
 ! khayr, baat aam bajet kii
 The impact of the villagers' anger in Gujarat was reflected in this
 bhaajapa ko vahaan haar ke kareeb khadaa karne main gramin gujarat kaa bada haath tha
 That is, the BJP has got the illusion that in the coming elections the road of the villages is not easy
 gaanvon kii dagar na hogi aasangujarat chunaav ke baad lokaneeti-siesds ne ek vishleshan pesh kiya
 According to him, villagers almost rejected the BJP in the Gujarat elections
 gramin kshetra kii 98 main se 36 siten hi uske hisse ain
 The Congress took the entire 57 seats
 siton kaa antar yah kehane ke liye thos aadhaar banaata he ki gramin gujarat khaastaur par kisaan bhaajapa se khush nahin
 Assembly elections are due in eight states this year and Lok Sabha elections in 2019
 jaahir he, in rajyon ke gramin ilaake bhi bhaajapa ke liye badi chunauti pesh kar sakate hai
 Further analysis should be left to the experts
 bajet main dikhi gramin bharat kii chintajetli ne is baar ke aam bajet main kisaanon ko bada tohfa diya
 Jaitley announced a shocking minimum support price for the kharif crop for 2018-19
 bajet main fasal kii laagat kaa dedh guna zyada daam kisaanon ko dene kaa praavdhaan kiya gaya
 1400 crores for the food processing sector
 praavdhaan kiya
 Said to run Operation Green for potato and onion production
 iske liye 500 karod ru
 Announced -krishi bazaar ke vikaas ke liye 2000 karod ru
 Will be provided -42 mega food park banane kii baat kahi
 - He also announced the conversion of 22 thousand Haats into agricultural markets in villages
 -krishi utpaadon ke niryaat ko 100 arab dollar ke str tak pahunchane kaa lakshya rakhaa
 The economists will be able to tell how successful all these plans will be after analysis
 lekin bajet main jis tarah se gaanvon or kisaanon kii chintaa dikhaai di usase ek baat to saaf he bhaajapa agle saal hone vaale aath rajyon ke chunaav or 2019 main hone vaale main aam chunaav main gujarat jaisaa haal nahin chaahati
 That is why she does not want to do anything to persuade the angry farmers and villagers
 kisi nae shahar main pehali naukari mili to utsaah hi alag hota he
 The feeling of pride when negotiating important things like salary and allowances is priceless
 ek pal main aap bade ho jate hai
 Become grown up
 or phir aati he parinaam kii ghadi- ek shahar se duusare shahar shift karne kaa samay
 Eating mother's hand and childhood man - shifting away from it to an unknown, new city can seem stressful
 man main kai sawaal uthte hai, kai chizon kii tension hoti he- kahaan rahenge? furniture kahaan se jutaayenge? jarurat ke samay koun madad karegaa? ham aapako bataate hai kuch aise tareeke jinase aap in sab dikkaton ko sahajata se dur kar sakate hai:1
 Most important: Finding the right house After arriving in a new city, there is a lot of trouble, do not understand where to live, where to start searching for your home
 iskaa behtareen tarika yah he ki apana tikat book karne se pehle hi ek makaan book kar len
 Search in the vicinity of your office
 makaan agar aapke nae offis ke aasapaas mila to aapke aane-jane kaa samay or paisa donon bachegaa
 It does not matter even if your budget is limited, choose the other best option and make sure that it is an area which is well connected to public transport and has all the basic facilities around it
 iske alaava, jab tak aapke paas market rate or anya jaankaree uplabdh na ho, kisi brokar ke madhyam se property dekhne kii koshish na karen
 You may have to pay more for doing so
 2
 Problems of furniture: If you see a fully furnished house, you will get rid of the worry of furniture
 isse basic furniture kharidne ke liye aapako kisi tarah kii rakam kharch karne kii jarurat nahin padegi or is bachat se aap kuch extra gharelu saamaan kharidne kii lagjri hasil kar sakate hai
 In this way you will be able to create a place like home even when away from home
 yahi nahin, makaan chhodane ke samay bhi aap furniture shift karne kii dikkat or kharch- dono se batch jaaenge
 3
 akele rahanaa kisko pasand he?kya aap bhi chaahate hai kii aapke paas aapaki pehali selary milane par saath party karne vaale ruumamets ho jinke saath aap maheene bhar kaa kharch baant len or ghar ke kaam miljul kar puure kar len? ye faisla aapako karnaa he
 To avoid loneliness in a new city, take a sharing flat
 haa, isse thodi niztaa khatm ho sakati he magar kam se kam aap maheene ke aakhir main akele, udhaas to nahin baithe honge, or na hi iskaa asar aapaki kaaryakshmata par padegaa
 4
 offis aane-jane ke liye kya karankisi nae shahar main rahane kaa matlab he ki na to hogi aapke paas papa kii car, or na hi hogi aapaki pasandida bike (haa, agar aap apni bike ko saath lekar aate hai to baat hi kuch or he!) isliye yah jaruri he ki aap pehle se hi nae shahar ke yatayaat ke saadhan dekh-samaj len, apane makaan ke jo sabase kareeb saadhan uplabdh hon, uski sevaayen len
 After all, you have to arrive on time for your new job and create a long-term good image in the eyes of your seniors
 kya aap aisa nahin chahenge? to apane offis ke liye koun sa root lenaa he, use tay kar len
 You should remember the full timing of bus / metro / local train etc
 yadi saubhaahgya se aapke ruumamets kaa offis bhi aapke offis ke aasapaas he, yaa aap ek hi offis main kaam karte hai, to unke saath aap pooling kaa vikalp bhi apana sakate hai
 5
 profeshnal contact banaaengetal ho jane ke baad aap aise logon se contact bananaa shuru karen jo aapako aapke peshey main tarakkee karne main madad kar sakate hon
 Your flat partner can also be used in this
 alag-alag profeshnal becoground or tarah-tarah ke anubhav hone kii vajah se ve apni jaankaree or sampark ke dwaara aapako aise logon se milaane main madad kar sakate hai, jo nikat bhavishya main nae avasaron ke daravaaje khol saken
 This can be another reason for you to share the flat
 google se to aapako kai saikadon makaanon kaa vikalp mil saktaa he, magar nae, anjaan shahar main koun sa ghar, koun sa ilaaka chunanaa he, ye kaise tay karen? ghabrahat hoti he, tension bhi
 If you want an easy way to relieve this tension, then look at the property available on nestave and find your home of choice right from home
 is par aap makaan talash kar brokerej kii bachat to kar hi sakate hai, saath hi aapako prachlit 10 maheene kii jagah mahaj 2 maheene kaa security diposit hi dena hota he
 Not only this, you get all such options of furnished apartments, where you can share a room or flat with your kind of people
 kitna aasaan he naa? to puri taiyaari kar len or bhavi jivan ke liye safalataa ke saath udaan bharen

 On the ngt's decision to ban the sit-in demonstrations at Jantar Mantar in the capital Delhi, the Aam Aadmi Party believes that recently the NGT should review its decision
 AAP kaa kahana he kijantar-mantar dashakon puraani jagah haijahaan se vah aawaaj buland hoti hai, jise satta ke galiyaaron main baithe janata ke numaayinde yaa phir prashasan main baithe adhikari nahin sunate hai

 AAP ke rashtriya pravaktaa dilip pandey ne kaha, "jantar-mantar par dharna-pradarshan rokane vaale NGT ke faisle kii pun: samiksha behad jaruri he, kyonki jo tark engiti dwaara diya gaya he, us tark ke hisaab se ramlila maidan ke rup main nai jagah zyada rihaayshi he or jantar-mantar ke mukaable vahaan aas-paas ke ilaake main zyada log rahete hai
 It has been decided by the NGT to change the place of the voice-speaker of the cloud, but more people live in the new place than the old one, so it should be reviewed
 "unhone kaha, "ham engiti ke har us prayaas kaa sammaan karte hai jisase paryaavaran ko saaf-svachh or pradooshamukt banane main sahaayta milti ho, lekin jantar-mantar ke is faisle par hamaara mat he ki is faisle kaa punarawalokan hona chahie
 "dilip Pandey said that the Aam Aadmi Party government of Delhi requested the NDMC and the Delhi Police to seek a re-observation of this decision of the NGT, as the NGT entrusted the responsibility of implementing these decisions to these agencies

 Just a simple search on Google will show that wherever there is abundance, Muslims are killing most Muslims, in the name of Islam
 ye vajah kai sawaal khadey karti he or jawaab maangati he
 1
 agar ye shanti kaa majahab he to phir katleam kyon?2
 If every religion is good but its followers are defaming the religion, then why are Hindus not killing other Hindus, like Muslims? 3
 hinduon ko kashmir ghati se kyon bhaagna padaa? sirf isliye ki ve alpsankhyak the?4
 Even during the most dangerous religious riots Gujarat 2002, Mumbai 1993 and Bhagalpur 1989, why did the Muslims not have to flee forever? 5
 iskaa uttar pakistan banane ke peeche chhipe maanas main he, jiskaa asar bhartiya musalamaanon ke ek achche khaase tabake par dikhataa he
 Imam Bukhari does not threaten to create a separate country for Muslims
 6
 So the rules are clear - i) If the number is less then stay part of democracy, withstand it
 ii) agar thik-thaak sankhya main alpsankhyak ho to pehle aatanki vaardaat ko anjaam do or phir khud ko aatank peedit bataao
 iii) When the majority is there, give only two options to the remaining people - conversion or deportation

 Thanks to Chandrakant Prasad Singh's blog u & ME) tivi kaa sabase dhamaakedaar or vivaadit sho 'big bos 13' (bigg Boss 13) logon kaa khub manoranjan kar rahaa he
 The new tasks or activities in 'bigg Boss 13' entertain the audience as well as make them laugh a lot at times
 lekin haal hi main big bos kii eks contestant or actress raakhi saavant sho ke kuch sadasyon par bhadakin najar aa rahi hai

 a post shared by Rakhi Sawant (@ rakhisawant2511) on Nov 8, 2019 at 4:16 am PST Rakhi Sawant shared her anger on Shefali Zariwala and Shehnaz Gill by sharing her video on Instagram
 unhone video main kaha, "aap log mujhe kya samajhate hai

 "in one of his videos, Rakhi Sawant said," Why are all these people lying behind me
 shame nahin aati mujhe itnaa trol karte hue
 "these videos of Rakhi Sawant are becoming very viral on social media, in which the actress is seen quite angry
 a post shared by Rakhi Sawant (@rakhisawant2511) on Nov 8, 2019 at 4:08am pstbawa den ki 'big bos 13' (bigg Boss 13) main beete din hi rashmi desai (rashmi Desai), siddharth shukla (sidharth Shukla) or arhan khan ke bich ladaai ho gai
 Meanwhile, Siddharth Shukla and Rashmi Desai were seen raging on each other
 vahiin, ghar main is baar aarti singh ke baad kanta laga girl shefali jarivaala ko captain ke taur par chunaa gaya
 Actually, there was voting between Shefali and Himanshi for the Captain, in which both got the same votes
 aise main khud aarti singh ne big bos ke kehane par shefali jarivaala ko ghar ke captain ke rup main chunaa
 These are the early days of summer in Delhi
 suraj din-ba-din chamkila, hawaaen garm or aasmaan dhuldhakkad se jajb he
 Meanwhile, the capital of the country is meditating with political heat more than the weather
 desh main aam chunaavon kii sargarmi he to asar rajdhani par padegaa hi
 There are two Delhiites from the sun above and Siyasati at the bottom of the war, that they are cool
 shabdon kii is jang se babasta, par beparwaah bhi
 Anyway, these words are very random
 
 
 dilli hameshaa vijetaon kii rahi he, isliye uske liye inaki koi ahmiyat nahin
 She makes history, creates history
 vah itihaas, jisase 'sahitya' banataa he
 That is why the opportunity to talk to Taslima Nasreen, the exiled writer of Bangladesh, jumped
 tasalima apane krantikari vichaaron ko lekar samoochee duniya main mashhoor hai
 Her free thoughts and fearlessness have made her taste an endless exile, yet she never remained silent
 maanavtawaad, maanavadhikaar, nari-swadhinata or naastikta jaise mudde uthaane ke kaaran vah lambey samay se dharmik kattarpathiyon kaa virodh jhelti rahi hai
 They have deep understanding of political revenge happening around the world
 aise main unase keval sahitya ke daayre main baat karnaa thodaa mushkil tha
 The latest book, 'besharam', is about meeting Taslima Nasreen
 tasalima nasrin ke bahucharchit upanyaas 'lajja' kii uttar katha he 'besaram'
 The meeting was arranged by publisher Rajkamal Prakashan
 'lajja' tasalima kii saal 1993 main prakashit vah kitaab he, jiske chalate unhen desh nikaala de diya gaya
 She was conceived
 'lajja' ke prakaashan ke baad se hi vah bangladesh se nirvasit hai
 
 
 And this process of deportation, deportation by deportation continues
 is bich vah europe ke ek bade hisse kaa daura kar chuki hai
 Nevertheless, he eventually liked India for his stay
 bharat, or usamen bhi pashchim bengal bhashaagat judaav ke chalate unke liye duusare ghar jaisaa he, par ek din tasalima ko pashchim bengal ke kolkata se bhi nikaal diya gaya
 
 
 In such a situation, Delhi became his destination
 dakshini dilli ke ek bheedbhad vaale ilaake main tasalima rahati hai
 The address is confidential for their security
 suraksha main dilli police ke jawan tainaat hai, par amuman apane ekant ko pasand karne vaali tasalima se milane-julne waalon kii ginati itani kam he ki surakshakarmiyon ko bhi aaraam he
 That is why the security personnel are not shocked when someone comes
 unhen pehle se pataa hota he ki milane vaala time lekar hi aayaa hoga
 Despite this, they do not let the visitor press the call
 unka kahana hota he ki agar aapane samay liya he, to khud se phone kar darwaja khulawaaie
 It is a compulsion to do so
 par mobile par ghanti bajte hi adhkhule daravaaje kii oot se do badi ankhen jhaankati hai
 He speaks a lot without speaking
 andar ghusane par aapkaa sabaka painting or kitabon se saje ek behad suruchipurna dryngroom se hota he
 Look the way from there, painting and books
 
 
 ghar kii sajja par bengali chhap, aap inhen nihaarte hai ki tasalima koi thanda peya le aati hai
 On seeing Taslima, there is no realization that you are meeting the person of international fame of writing, who is in danger of his life! That he who approved his freedom of expression, writing and deportation in honor of a woman is not an apology, that his supporters count in crores of readers, that he is extremely fearless even in these conditions, that for which freedom and equality means every woman The equality of women, the free thought of every woman, which ultimately contained the freedom of mankind
 prastut he tasalima nasrin se baatcheet ke khaas anshah1
 When did the process of becoming your writer begin? i was thirteen when i started writing poetry
 ye kavitaayen vahaan kii sthaneey saahitiyik patrikaon main chapani bhi shuru huin
 Bangla language is full of such magazines encouraging young writers
 ye patrikaayen abhivyakti or vichaaron kii swatantraaa ko vyakt karatin thim
 When i used to come to the book fairs held in Kolkata, i used to see hundreds of such magazines
 main in patrikaon se itnaa prabhavit thi ki satraa saal kii umr main swayan bhi aisi ek patrika nikaali
 In this, i would give new writers a chance
 iskaa sampadan khud karti
 My brother used to pay for the publication
 is tarah meraa likhnaa hameshaa hi jari rahaa
 i was a student of medicine
 uskaa course kaaphi bada hota he, isliye tisare saal main meraa likhnaa band ho gaya
 But once i became a doctor, i started writing again
 2
 Who are your inspirations in the writing field? i was influenced by my elder brother
 vah patrika nikaalte the, or unhone mujhe hameshaa lekhan ke liye protsaahit kiya
 My poetry books came out in 1986 and 1989
 inamen meri duusari kitaab ko kaaphi safalataa mili
 Many versions of it were printed
 iske baad kai akhabaaron ke sampadakon ne mujhase stambh lekhan ke liye sampark kiya
 i started writing a column based on the status of women
 isse mere sampark kaa dayera badha
 3
 'lajja' likhane kaa vichaar jab dimag main aayaa, to kya aapako yah pataa tha ki ise lekar aisi pratikriya hogi? nirvaasan jhelana hoga?main stambh likhti thi
 i also started writing novels at the behest of the editors of my magazines
 meri kai kitaaben chap chukin thim
 When the Babri Masjid collapsed in 1992, i was stunned to see its reaction in Bangladesh
 hinduon ke upar julm ko maine apni ankhon se dekha
 i thought how could these fundamentalists do this
 mere kai dost hindu the
 My patients were also Hindus
 main unke gharon main gai
 This situation had hurt me even inside
 maine jaankaree ikattha karnaa shuru kiya, ek dastavej or aankade kii shakl main
 Based on facts only
 par ye sab itane bhayaavah the ki maine ise duniya ko bataane kii sochaa or is tarah 1993 main 'lajja' chapa 
 4
 'lajja' ne aapako beshumaar shoharat dilaai, saath hi aapako ek antaheen sangharsh bhi diya
 What do you think about it? Lajja was not the only reason for me leaving Bangladesh
 kattarpanthi jamaat mahilaon kii aazaadee or unki sthitiyon ko lekar mere vichaaron se pehle se hi sahamat nahin the
 Tradition
 rudhiyaan, dharm, vichaar sab mere khilaaf the
 They were against my thinking
 ve bahusnkhyakon dwaara alpsankhyakon par julm par mere vichaaron ke khilaaf the
 5
 'besaram' ko aapane 'lajja' kii uttarkatha kaha he, jabaki 'lajja' kii prishthbhumi main bangladesh tha, or 'besaram' main bharat? donon hi pustakon se aapkaa sandesh kya he?maine kisi sandesh ke liye ye kitaaben nahin likhin
 i wrote the circumstances of my time in these books
 'lajja' ke paatr mujhase real life main kolkata main mil gaye to 'besaram' kii bhoomika bani
 It is rare that a writer meets his characters
 'besaram' main nari adhikaar, maanavadhikaar, hindu-muslim ekta ke bare main likhaa
 It is up to my readers what they take from it
 julekha ke madhyam se narimukti bhi he, to suranjan kaa hindutv bhi
 My purpose is to tell that good and evil are in everyone
 hindu-musalmaan, stri-purush koi ek hi isse judaa ho aisa nahin he
 Everything happens in everyone
 6
 If we ask you, what is the caliber of your deportation? So what would you say? Who likes exile? pehle mujhe lagata tha ki main shaayad ekadin laut sakati hum
 But this hope is over
 mere bachapan ke saathi, mere sampadak, mere rishtedaar, mere apane
 
 
 Even in their pleasantries, there is a malaise to not meet them
 par maine is daur main bhi itane kaam kiye, bina kisi raajnneetik dal va sanstha se judakar jo kuch kiya, usase mujhe apane ateet par koi pachhtaawaa nahin he
 It is a matter of thinking that the secular country in which i was born in 1971 became so radical that i could not go there on the death of my mother, my Baba and my grandfather
 
 
 ( lambii saans ke saath ek chuppi) phir bhi mujhe pashchaatap nahin he, kyonki main mahilaon kii aazaadee, maanavtaa ke paksh main ladi
 i am satisfied that i am with the truth
 jiske chalate mere khilaaf fatwa bhi jari hua
 There was also an attempt to murder me
 
 
 baavjood iske main yah nahin kah sakati ki mujhe akelepan kaa ahsaas nahin hota! main bhi insaan hum, dikkat mujhe bhi mahasoos hoti he
 7
 bangladesh, europe ke kai desh, phir bharat
 
 
 West Bengal and Delhi here too? What kind of soil, people and culture did you like? There are many good people and bad people everywhere
 har desh main hai
 i have always wanted to go to my country
 main apane prakashkon, doston se milanaa chaahati hum
 Since i cannot go there, so i came to West Bengal
 bhashaa, boli or rahan sahan ke chalate yah mere liye mere duusare ghar jaisaa tha
 Here i came from Europe
 vahaan ke saare maukon ko chhod kar
 i loved Bengali, Bengali culture
 par yahaan bhi 2007 main meri kitaab bain kar di gai
 i had a second exile from here
 mere liye yah bahut dukhad sthiti he
 8
 'lajja' se 'besaram' tak, bangladesh or bharat main, bhartiya samaaj or siyasat main kya kuch badla?badlaav se bhala kise inkaar ho saktaa he, par afsos yah he ki is badlaav va vikaas main 'stri' kii sthiti main us str par badlaav nahin hua, jitna hona chahie
 The more the woman progressed, the more she was also exploited
 bangladesh main pitrusattatmak samaaj main abhi vah badlaav nahin aayaa
 Despite all the pace of development, efforts are constantly being made to suppress women
 phir hamaari saamaajik vyavastha main kai dikkatein hai
 In our matrimonial system, men maintain their relationships
 santanotpatti tak main uski apni marji nahin chalati
 If today she is allowed to get a job, then it also involves thinking of the family, husband's financial help
 mahilaayein abhi bhi paramparaagat bhoomika hi nibhaati hai
 She cannot give money to her family
 agar aap mahilaon ko sahi myanon main barabari kaa darja dena chaahate hai to aapako 'pitrusattatmak' samaaj khatm karnaa hoga
 a woman is a victim of rape only because it is filled in the boys' mind that the 'girl' is an object of your use
 aap mujhe bataaie, jo purush veshyavriti karke aata he, vah kisi bhi mahila ko acchhee najar se kaise dekh saktaa he? uske liye har stri ek 'sex object' hi rahati he! stri ko apane sharir par hi adhikaar nahin
 Even in an institution like marriage, she is a victim of rape - marital rape
 isiilie main har ladki ko yah kahati hum, apane adhikaar ke liye, sammaan ke liye vah buree bane
 As bad as she is, she will oppose the system, she will find herself
 apane sammaan va barabari ko paaegi
 9
 aap indinon kis project par kaam kar rahi hai?kuch akhabaaron main stambh likh rahi hum
 Writing poetry is reduced
 ek upanyaas or aatmakatha ke aathven bhaag par kaam kar rahi hum
 10
 abhi srilanka main carch par hamale hue
 Fanaticism is increasing all over the world
 bataur lekhak aap iskaa kya samaadhaan dekhati hai?shiksha kattarta ko khatm karne kaa eklauta madhyam he
 As long as the emphasis is on religion, this situation will not change
 rajya kaa dakhal dharm se khatm ho
 The state should not promote it in any way
 dharm hameshaa vyakti kii nijee aasthaa kaa vishay rahe
 Scientific thinking should be promoted
 vishesh baat yah ki yah kaam sabhi ko milakar karnaa hoga
 Be it Hindu, Muslim, Sikh or Christian
 sabhi ko yah samajhnaa hoga ki 'aatankwaad' dharm se hi, dharmik kattarta se hi aa rahaa he
 Hate trade has to be banned
 durbhaagya yah ki dharm logon ko sahishnu nahin kar rahaa
 It is also to be noted here that these circumstances will not change with academic education alone
 barabari, ekta, karunaa, samvednaa kii shiksha sabko di jaae
 i mean 'good education'
 inasaaniyat or maanviyata kii shiksha se he
 11
 apane prashansakon, pathakon ke liye koi sandesh?meraa apana kuch bhi nahin he

 Mamta wrote on the social networking site Facebook, 'I have given voice to the millions who want to be like the President
 ’ apane rukh main narmi laane se inkaar karte hue unhone kaha, ‘meri party choti party he
 Our party is not large nor does it have the same resources as others
 ham sachai or vishwaas ke sahare chalate hai
 i have stood by principles all my life
 maine jo rukh apanaaya he, us par kaayam hum
 Referring to the supremacy of the people in a democracy, Mamata urged the people to prepare a public memorandum to support Kalam
 unhone kaha, ‘aapaki aawaaj suni jaani chahie
 i will respect the will of the people
 ’missile main ko bharat kaa vishisht putr bataate hue pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri ne kaha ki kalam hameshaa se kshudra raajnneeti se upar rahe
 He said, 'he is a proponent of truth, an ocean of knowledge and a fair-working man who is above petty politics

 'significantly, the Trinamool Congress chief had proposed the name of Kalam by joining hands with Samajwadi Party President Mulayam Singh
 haalanki baad main sapa pramukh ne pranav mukherjee kaa samarthan kar diya
 Despite being isolated from the Congress-led upa's appointment of Pranab Mukherjee as the Presidential candidate, Mamata remained firm on the name of Kalam's candidature on Friday night, saying that the game had just begun

 ' dilli ke CM arvind kejariwal ne apane vidhayakon or unke parivaaravaalon kii ek anokhi class lee he
 In fact, this 'moral class' was necessitated because his minister Asim Ahmad Khan was sacked in the 6 lakh bribe case
 aasim ahamed khan kii barkhaastagike baad aam aadmi party ke vidhayakon or mantriyon ko kejariwal ne parivaar samet baithak main bulaayaa
 Amid the splattering and tainted allegations of mounting allegations against ministers and mlas, a credit crisis arose before the Kejriwal government
 aise main lajimi tha ki kejariwal vidhayakon or mantriyon se charchaa karte
 But Kejriwal also called the family members to the meeting, then it became clear that somewhere, Kejriwal was also deciding the participation of party leaders' wife and children in the aap's image reform campaign
 apane vidhayakon or mantriyon ke parivaar ke saath kejariwal charchaa main jute, to baahar badi-badi lagjri gadiyon kii line ne sanket de diya ki aam aadmi ke naam par viipi banane kii siyasat kaa andaaj kaisaa hota he
 The type of vehicles that the AAP MLA came up in has raised a question as to whether they are really common people, because cars like Audi and Fortuner are not common to the common man
 phir kejariwal to khud viipi culture ke khilaaf rahe hai
 AAP mlas are those who went by metro for the swearing-in ceremony
 lekin aaj unheen netaaon main koi audi se utraa, koi farchuner se utraa, to koi BMW or inova se
 That is, the color was special
 agar aap 12veen paas hai or aisi naukari talash rahe hai, jisamen paisa or rutaba donon ho to aapke liye sibiai acchhee khabar lekar aayaa he

 sanjay dutt kii adaakaari aisi he ki public teen dashak se sir-ankhon par bithai hui he
 But he did commit a crime that life would last for three and a half years
 jail kii jindagi kaa countdown shuru ho gaya he
 The question is how Sanjay Dutt's jail will be cut? One of Bollywood's most expensive actors, Sanjay Dutt's life is passing like a common prisoner in Mumbai's Arthur Road Jail
 subah tay samay par uthanaa, jail kaa bhojan karnaa apane cell main pade rahanaa
 But amidst all this, Sanjay Dutt does not forget to recite Hanuman Chalisa in the morning
 dekhen video: jindagi kii rahon par kaise gumraah hue 'munnabhai'khata to chand lamhon main hui, par sajaa main saal-dar-saal guzarate jaaenge
 Be it the hero who conquers the heart, or the villain who gives a sigh, or the comedian who laughs at the faces of diving into gloom, Zindagi has created a new role for Sanjay Dutt, who plays each role in his own style
 The prisoner's
 1993 ke mumbai bam dhamaakon ke samay avaidh tareeke se hathiyaar rakhane ke liye doshi tehraae gaye sanjay dutt ko mumbai ke arthor road jail main band kiya gaya he
 The jail ground is now the bed for superstars who sleep on the Velvet SEZ and the loneliness of the jail has replaced the crowd of fans
 dekhen video: sanjay dutt ko yeravada jail le jane par suspencegruuvaar kii shaam sanjay dutt ko mumbai kii arthor road jail laayaa gaya
 Sanjay Dutt has been kept in a special cell of this jail
 bahari duniya main sanjay dutt chaahe jitani badi shakhsiyat hon, jail ke bheetar unhen aam kaidi kii tarah hi rahanaa padataa he
 Here Munnabhai's life moves forward with the ticking of the clock
 shuukravaar kii subah sanjay dutt ke liye jail kii pehali subah thi
 Sanjay Dutt woke up at 6:30 pm like other prisoners
 uske kuch der baad inhen subah kii chaay mili
 Sanjay Dutt was served a snack
 lekin uske baad canteen se biscuit kharidkar wo khate rahe
 Although he had gone home to eat food in the afternoon, but Sanjay Dutt returned home
 jail menu ke mutabik milane vaali daal or chapatti khai
 In the evening, Sanjay Dutt ate bananas for breakfast
 khaas baat ye he ki jis jail kaa khaanaa achche-acchon ke halak ke neeche nahin utarataa, wo khaanaa sanju baba ko behad lajij laga
 This is the reason why Sanjay Dutt ate the jail food at night too
 pichhali baar sanjay dutt ne jail main kursiyaan banane kaa kaam kiya tha
 But this time, according to Mahesh Bhatt, who is considered close to him, Sanjay Dutt will teach the drama to the prisoners and yes, if found the time, he will bring the reality of his life's book in front of the world
 teen ghante kii film main naa jane kitni baar kapade badalane vaale sanjay dutt ke liye jail kii salaakhon ke peeche kaidiyon kaa vahi paramparaagat kapadaa pahananaa he, safed pant or kameez
 Sanjay Dutt knows how the loneliness of the jail runs to bite, so it is reported that he has taken Ramayan, Hanuman Chalisa and Geeta with him
 sanjay dutt roj subah 8 baje hanuman chalisa kaa paath karte hai or saath hi rudraksh kii maala pherate hai
 This routine continues in jail too
 jail kii udhaas shaam or akelepan kii andheri raaton main kya pataa ramayana, hanuman chalisa or gita hi mushkil halaat kaa saamana karne kii himmat de de
 Film actor Sanjay Dutt was sent to Arthur Road Jail last Thursday
 lekin sanjay dutt chaahate hai ki unhen pune ke yaravada jail main bhej diya jaae, jahaan pichhali baar bhi unhone apni kuch sajaa kaati thi
 Sanjay Dutt and sister Priya Dutt who visited him also pleaded with the jail authorities, but before Monday, Yerwada jail seems far away
 jaij kaamon ke liye swiss bainkon kaa istemaal karne vaale america bhi ab ek halafanama bharte hai jiske aadhaar par america tex prashasan se suchanaaen saajha kii jaati hai
 According to a reputed magazine ranking the world's richest people this has happened because the US government has aggressively extracted the black money information of the American people from Swiss banks and tied the banks with strict conditions, after which the US But the mythical secrecy of Swiss banks has ended
 kaale dhan kii jannaton ke parade nochane kaa yahi tarika he
 When the people of India were expecting similar stamina from their new government, then the government shied from disclosing foreign accounts of black money in the Supreme Court and entered into that shell of secrecy with which it has to grapple at the global level
 
 suchanaaen chhipaana kaale dhan ke kaarobaar kii antarrashtriya takat he, jise todane ke liye viksit deshon ke bich kar soochnaaon ke aadan-pradaan kaa nayaa tantra taiyaar he
 India had to leave the urge for secrecy and start a campaign to become part of it, so that foreign accounts of black money could be accessed
 kaali kamai ke videshi khaaton par germany se mili soochnaaon kii pardadari kaa sarkari halafanama kanoonee to he lekin saahsee katai nahin
 The names of some account holders with black money could have been revealed because according to the white paper presented in Parliament in May 2012, prosecution has started in 17 cases from the information received from Germany and after the prosecution has started, the officials of the Ministry of Finance are considered
 The secrecy of the treaty does not come in the way
 kaala dhan rakhane waalon ke naam chhipaane main germany ke saath kar sandhi kii sharton kii hi oot lee gai he
 The truth is also that the bonds of tax treaties are strict
 is vyavastha main suchanaaen hasil karne ke liye vikasshil desh, viksit deshon ko baari kar riyaayaten dete hai
 The system of tax treaties also helps countries like India hide information, as is happening at the moment
 kar sandhiyaan kaale dhan kii awajahi rokane main kargar sabit nahin huin isliye viksit deshon ne kar soochnaaon ko baantne kaa ek automatic tantra banaaya he
 India has to join this system
 lekin iske liye jis himmat kii jarurat he, vah kaale dhan ke maamle main najar nahin ai
 An affidavit of black money overseas accounts would have been formed in Delhi last month when the Finance Minister of the developed countries in Kenge (australia) was finalizing the framework for the exchange of tax information, enforced through legislation
 Will go
 2018 se sakriy hone vaale is soochna tantra kii ghoshnaa agle maah bristben kii ji20 shikhar baithak main hogi, jahaan pradhanmantri narendra modi bhi honge
 The uninterrupted exchange of information between different countries eliminates the secrecy due to which tax havens that hide black money work
 viksit deshon kaa yah tantra soochnaaon ke swachaalit vinimay kii pranali he
 Under the current system, countries have to ask for information from each other, in which corrupt officials hide information
 tex justise network ke mutabik, kaala dhan chhipaane waalon par nakel daalane ke liye yah tantra sabase prabhavi vyavastha he
 India needs this information most which is a big victim of corruption and whose loot is stored in the tax havens from which the developed countries are extracting their black money
 kaale dhan par america kii sakhti ke baad switzraland kaa sabase purana vegalin bank pichley saal band ho gaya
 UBS has had to pay heavy fines for hiding the black money of the American people
 2011 main britain ne bhi swiss bainkon se britaniyon ke kaale dhan par motaa tex vasuulana shuru kar diya he
 If the people of India expect the same from their new government, it is not wrong, because this government has come to power on the promise of bringing back the black money stashed abroad
 yah baat alag he ki videshi khaaton tak pahunchane kaa rasta paardarshita se hokar jaataa he, jise banane kaa dam-kham abhi tak najar nahin aayaa he
 In India, hiding the truth is part of government rule that is not only favorable for black money but also hinders participation in transparency efforts
 jahaan khufia agenciyaan hi aapas main suchanaaen na baantati hon or bainkon ke bich difoltaron kii jaankariyon kaa saz hi na hota ho vahaan tex haiven se suchanaaen lenaa khaam khyaali hi he
 Pascal St
 Ammens, director of the OECD Center of Tax Policy, said in May this year that the tax system of developing countries is not modern enough to be made part of the automatic exchange of information
 agar bristben kii ji20 baithak main bharat kar soochna tantra se judane kaa dabaav banayega to uski apni paradedaari in koshishon kii chugali karegi
 The global mechanism of hiding black money is based on the fiercely competitive urges of secrecy that make it transparent to our rules to be the first condition, as it is a tax haven where the true disguise is traded under the law
 ummid thi ki nai sarkaar kanoon badalane or paardarshita kaa saahas dikhaaegi lekin supreme court main halafname ne kaale dhan ko lekar gopneeyata kii amaavas ko or gadha kar diya he
 This is a big start of the campaign against black money
 uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath somvaar ko pratapgarh ke madhupur gaanv pahunche
 Here the CM installed a chaupal and communicated directly with the public
 madhupur gaanv ke skool praangan main raatri chaoupal ke is kaarykram main mukhyamantri gaanv ke hajaaron logon se mukhaatib hue or ek-ek kar sabhi yojanaon ke bare main logon se jaankaree lee
 The first question Yogi lashed out at the authorities was on the toilet, how many people have got toilets in the village and how many have not
 is sawaal ke jawaab main zyaadaatar logon ne shauchalay nahin milane kii shikaayat kii
 After which the Chief Minister ordered the officers to come before the public and asked for information about the toilets there
 iske baad mukhyamantri ne 24 ghante ke andar gaanv ke sabhi logon ko shauchalay ke paise yani 12 hajaar rupee unke acount main transfar kiye jane kaa aadesh diya
 The question of Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana came after the question of Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, most of the people were unhappy in this as they did not get the benefit of this scheme
 ek baar phir jile ke dm or bidio samet duusare adhikariyon ko talab kiya gaya
 The Chief Minister was told that houses have been given to 126 people and a list of more than 140 people is ready
 jiske baad manch se labhaarthiyon ke naam padhe gaye or phir un logon ke bhi naam padhe gaye jinhen agle kuch dinon main pradhanmantri awaas yojana ke tahat makaan die jane hai
 When asked about the ration card and different pension in Madhupur, the largest village of Pratapgarh, the public got the same answer that 'not received'
 ek baar phir bifere mukhyamantri ne manch se adhikariyon ko khub sunaaya or saream unhen chetavanee dete hue kaha ki kisi tarah kii kotahi bardaasht nahin kii jaaegi
 The Chief Minister also reprimanded the public after giving a fair trial to the public
 unhone janata ko virodh karne ke liye yojanaon ko puri tareeke se samajhane kii hidaayat di or kaha ki sarkaar kii yojanaon ko samajhen or usamen apane liye chune
 Earlier on coming to the stage, the Chief Minister gave the keys of the house under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana to the beneficiaries
 saath hi god bharaai rasm ke tahat garbhvatee mahilaon ko uphaar die or annaprashan yojana kii shuruyaat apane haathon se kii
 The Chief Minister's chaupal lasted for about two hours
 isamen kabhi log taaliyaan bajaate najar aae to kabhi virodh karte hue dikhe
 After Yogi Choupal, CM Yogi said while talking to Aaj Tak that UP is the largest state in the country
 unhone kaha, 'main janata se roj miltaa hum, unki samasyaayein sunata hum, lekin ab chaoupal lagaai
 He said that it was necessary to come to this program because the Prime Minister has selected more than 20 thousand villages because more than half the population of scheduled castes live in these villages
 daliton ke yahaan bhojan karne par unhone kaha ki yah koi chunavi vyavastha nahin he
 This is part of our Gram Swaraj Abhiyan, in which the confidence of the person standing on the last run of the society is also to build trust and i have brought the same agenda
 upi chunaavake dauraan congress mahasachivarahul gandhika kanpur main somvaar ko yojit road sho vivaadon main funs gaya
 a case of violation of election code of conduct has been registered against Rahul Gandhi for carrying out road shows on the road without permission
 ye maamla dhara 88, 283, 290 ke tahat darj kiya gaya
 District Collector Hariom of Kanpur said that the district administration had set the time for Rahul Gandhi's roadshow from 10 am to 12 am and allowed it to be taken out on the 20 km route in the city
 unhone kaha ki somvaar ko mahashivaratri kaa tyohaar kii vajah se shahar main kai jagah se shiv yatra nikaali jaati he isliye samay seemaa kaa ulanghan karnaa aachaar samhita kaa ulanghan he
 Hariom said that the Roadshow completely violated the code of conduct and that the roadshow started at 10:30 in the morning and ended at around 3:30 pm and the limit was set higher than the prescribed route so against the organizers of the roadshow a case of violation of the code of conduct will be registered
 udhar, congress kii pradesh adhyaksh reeta bahuguna joshi kaa kahana he ki aachaar samhita kaa koi ulanghan nahin hua he or party ne jila prashasan ke is ruukh ke bare main chunaav ayog ko suchit kar diya he
 Meanwhile, Union Coal Minister Sriprakash Jaiswal challenged the district administration in a press conference and said that if he has the courage then he should file a case against him as he organized the road show
 kanpur main paanchaven charan main 23 farvari ko matdaan hona he
 Chairman of Uttar Pradesh Media Publicity Committee, Raj Babbar said that a huge crowd rallied at the roadshow in which a crowd of youths, women and children appeared to meet the Congress leader
 road sho ke dauraan kaint ilaake main kuch muslim sanghathanon ke yuvakon ne rahul ke kafile ko kaale jhande bhi dikhaae
 Religious faith is once again fragmented, the trust of the devotees once again shattered
 ladki se chhedchhad ke maamle main dilli police ne badrinaath ke mukhya pujari keshav namboodiri ko giraftaar kar liya he
 Namboodiri along with his brother Vishnu Pradhan have also been arrested in the same case
 donon mahrauli ke chhatarpur sthit ek hotel se dhare gaye
 According to the girl's complaint, she went to meet the priest, where she was molested
 namboodiri ko badrinaath shrin board ke apane pad se bhi nilambit kar diya gaya he
 Ganesh Godiyal, president of the Badri Kedar temple committee, said, 'this news is very unfortunate
 dilli police ne unhen giraftaar kar liya he
 Believing the news, we suspended him with immediate effect
 ab ye unke upar he ki wo kaise khud ko nirdosh sabit karte hai
 If he gets a clean chit from the court, he will be handed over his throne with all due respect
 'chunki maamla aasthaa ke centre badrinaath se judaa he, lihaaja police puure maamle kii behad satarkta se jaanch kar rahi he
 CCTV footage of the hotel is being scrutinized so that the entire picture is cleared
 gold monetigeshan skim ko skim ko launch hue kareeb 15 din ho gaye hai lekin janata ne isamen dilchaspee nahin dikhaai he
 So far, only 400 grams of gold has been stored under this scheme
 abhi or purity centres kii jaruratindustry ke ek pramukh sutara ke mutabik, sone kii jaanch ke liye centres kii kami hona is asafatla kii ek mukhya vajah he, jiske liye vitt mantralay se baat kii gai hai
 Apart from this, a lot of paperwork in banks is also coming up as a reason for not getting good response to the scheme
 kendra sarkaar kii is yojana kaa makasad desh main bina upyog ke pade kareeb 52 lakh karod rupee se zyada ke 20 hajaar ton sone ko bazaar main laana tha
 According to sources of purity will increase, the Ministry of Finance has been appealed to speed up this gold scheme to allow jewelers registered with the BIS Act to deposit gold
 ek mantralay ke pramukh ne bataaya he ki 55 gold purity centre disambar tak khol die jaaenge jo philhal mahaj 29 hai
 With this, the number of gold refineries will also be increased from 4 to 20
 agar yah skim puure tareeke se lagu hoti he to yah sarkaar, vyapaar or aam aadmi, teenon ke liye hi phayda kaa sauda sabit hogi
 Know how - Common man has three options 1) He can avoid the making charge of 10-15% on jewelery by buying gold coins
 2) vah apana sona bank main jamaa karke limited period ke baad use waapas le saktaa he
 3) He can buy gold from minimum 1 gram to 500 grams and invest in sovereign bonds
 gold skim ke 5 bade phaayde1) is skim ke tahat sone ko bank main jamaa karakar sarkaar use vittiya nivesh ke liye istemaal kar sakati he
 Due to this, gold imports will also be reduced
 2) yah skim isliye bhi behatar he kyonki isse loker main bina byaaj ke pade sone se behatar vikalp mil rahaa he
 It is not you, but the bank will give you interest
 3) isse hone vaali kamai inakam tex or capital gen tex ke daayre main bhi nahin aegi
 4) Gold will be available to the traders in the domestic market itself, which will relieve them from the burden of import duty
 5) is yojana se ek bade str par sone ke gahane banane vaale udyog main ho rahi chori rukegi
 The government will take the hallmarked jewelery for which certification is required
 is tarah purity vaale item bazaar main aaenge or sone main milawat kam hogi
 This will lead to a better hold globally
 kyon ye skim he aapke liye khasis skim ke tahat aap apana sona bank main jamaa kar sakate hai jiske badale bank aapako ek nishchit dar par byaaj degaa
 This is a profitable deal because when you keep gold with a locker, you have to pay money to the bank, but only the bank will give you the money
 sona jamaa karne kii adhiktam seemaa nahinkshbhi dwaara jari disha nirdeshon ke mutabik is yojana main kam se kam 30 gram 995 shuddhta vaala sona bank main rakhana hoga jabaki adhiktam kii koi seemaa nahin he
 This will include gold bars, coins, jewelry etc
 dhyaan rahen ki isamen metal shaamil nahin hoga
 There will be a check of purity before depositing
 In this scheme, gold can be deposited in three ways
 short turm (1 se 3 saal), medium turm (5 se 7 saal) or long turm (12 se 15 saal)
 Also, before depositing the gold, its purity will be checked
 iske baad hi jamaa karne sambandhi kaam aage badhaayaa ja sakegaa
 Withdraw gold or money, both options At the end of the existing maturity period, you will have the option to either take money or withdraw your gold
 acchhee baat yah he ki aapako bhugtan us samay sone kii keemat ke anusaar hi kiya jayega
 Only when you go to deposit gold will you be asked which option you are going to choose
 dhyaan rahe ki aap ise baad main badal nahin sakate

 log in dilli sarkaar ne jaanaleva pradooshan se nipatane ke liye dilli main agle saal se hi BS-6 petrol or dijal laane kaa faisla kiya he
 As soon as the news comes, the question is in everyone's mind that to what extent pollution will stop only by changing petrol and diesel
 yah sawaal uthanaa isliye vaazib he kyonki sarkaar dilli main agle saal se bharat stage 6 kaa petrol or dijal to laa rahi he lekin bies-6 gaadiyaan laane kii samay seemaa philhal nahin badali gai he jo ki 2020 he
 Earlier, the time limit for bringing both Bharat Stage 6 vehicles and petrol and diesel was only 2020
 lekin dilli ke jaanaleva pradooshan par jab haahaakaar machaa tab sarkaar ne aanan-fanan main yah faisla kar liya ki dilli main april 2018 se or puure ensiaar main 2019 se bies-6 petrol or dijal hi bechaa jayega
 Petroleum expert Narendra Taneja says that this decision of the government will go a long way in reducing Delhi's pollution and people will feel relieved
 unka kahana he ki bies-4 ke mukaable bies-6 dijal main pradooshan failaane vaale khatarnaak padaarth 70 se 75 fisadi tak kam hote hai
 Narendra Taneja says that due to the absence of vehicles BS-6, it will not get immediate benefits, but in spite of this, there will be a reduction in pollution
 iske aane par khaastaur se dijal kii gadiyon se hone vaale pradooshan main badi raahat milegi kyonki nitrogen dioxide, carbon monooxide sulfur dioxide or particulet matter ke maamle main BS-6 level kaa dijal kaaphi behatar hoga
 These are dangerous polluting substances, which cause various types of diseases ranging from cancer, asthma to lungs
 khaas baat yah he ki bharat ke tamaam privet or kuch sarkari tel companiyaan pehle se hi BS-6 petrol or dijal kaa utpaadan kar to rahi hai lekin desh main koi niyam nahin hone kii vajah se yah duusare viksit deshon ko niryaat kiya ja rahaa tha lekin bharat main nahin bechaa ja rahaa tha
 But to supply BS-6 petrol diesel across Delhi and NCR on a large scale, either the government will have to ask government oil companies to improve their technology immediately or buy oil from private oil companies
 narendra taneja kaa kahana he ki bies-6 petrol or dijal kaa utpaadan mahangaa he or puure desh main ise lagu karne ke liye tel companiyon ko 50 hajaar se lekar 70 hajaar karod rupye kaa kharch karke apni rifinary ko aadhunik bananaa hoga
 One challenge will be that BS-6 petrol-diesel will be available only in Delhi from next year but in NCR this decision will be applicable from 2019
 iskaa matlab yah hua ki noida, gurugram, sonipat, faridabad, gajiabad or greater noida jaisi jagahon se bies-4 petrol or dijal lekar gaadiyaan bedadak dilli main aati jaati rahengi aurapradooshan failaati rahengi
 Diesel carts are the biggest cause of pollution and toxic substances emanating from them are the most dangerous for health
 isiilie jab tak yah faisla kam se kam puure ensiaar main lagu nahin hota tab tak iskaa asar to dikhegaa lekin koi bahut bada fark dekhne ke liye thodaa or intjaar karnaa hoga jab 2019 se BS-6 dijal or petrol puure ensiaar main milane lagegaa

 For more details click here tarah-tarah ke tablet computer bazaar main pichley kuch samay se tahalaka machaa rahe hai
 These tablets are also occupying the market share of mid-range laptops after small screen netbook computers
 aise main computer banane vaali companiyaan apane notebook yaa laptop ko kuch is tarah badal rahi hai ki unke utpaadon main bhi kanjumar kii dilchaspee bani rahe
 People continue to like laptops, so their appearance and performance are being changed considerably
 desh-duniya ke bazaaron main ab dhadadhad aakarshak, patale or superfast ultrabux utaare ja rahe hai
 Actually, Ultrabook is not a technology, it is a trademark of Intel which has set its own rules for this new type of laptop
 intel kaa kahana he ki ultrabuk behad patali, bahut kam samay main shuru hone, zyada bydaree life or security se las honi chahie
 The biggest thing is that these devices should be priced around $ 1,000
 chunki ultrabuk trademark he isliye inamen bahut kam bijli khaane vaale intel ke nae siuelvi procesar or second janareshan intel aai-kor procesar hone chahie
 They should have integrated graphics, solid-state drives, unibody design as well as long-lasting batteries
 intel ke mutabik netbuk kii tulana main ultrabuk kii screen zyada badi (kam se kam 13 inch) or inaki processing power or storage kshamta bhi behatar honi chahie
 But like netbooks, ultrabooks will not have any optical or slot drives as well as many regular ports
 netbuks kii tarah ultrabux sasti to nahin, lekin suvidhaon or speed ke maamle main behatar jarur honi chahie
 Sandeep Arora, director, marketing, South Asia, Intel, says, "these smart and attractive, extremely thin devices will perform faster than ever, will have security features and will have tremendous ability to respond to user needs
" ' bahut patali, halki or khubasurat hone kii vajah se inhen lifestil accesries ke rup main khushi-khushi sweekaar kiya jayega
 Due to the long battery life and not very expensive, Intel expects Ultrabook devices to cause a lot of upheaval in the field of mobile computing
 arora ko ummid he ki intel centrino technology ne aath saal pehle mobile computing technology kaa jo kayapalat kiya tha, vaisaa hi badlaav ultrabuk bhi kar sakati he
 But it is too early to dismiss the netbook
 khaas taur par aise vakt jabaki ultrabuk kii keemat aaj bhi netbuk kii tulana main doguni se zyada he
 But many companies have announced to focus on Ultrabooks in the coming times
 ultrabux bhale hi netbuks ko khatm na karen lekin yah kaam tablet computer jarur kar rahe hai
 Ultrabooks can be an alternative to medium and expensive laptops and they too will compete with the tablet in one way or the other
 duusari peedi kii in aakarshak divices main aapke ishaaron or haav-bhav se cmand lene kii kshamta hogi or tachascreen jaisi khubiyaan bhi dikhaai dengi
 Citing a research on touch-related applications in the Ultrabook, Intel says that in a two-part design like a laptop, users have no difficulty in using the keyboard with touch on the screen
 yani ve behad aasaani se do hisson main banty ultrabuk tach kaa istemaal kar paaenge
 Says Arora, "in the future, after the use of Touch, there will be more and more new uses in the design and size of Ultrabooks
 do hisson vaali laptop kii dizin ke saath hi hybrid or canvertible saamne aaenge
 Also, there will definitely be designs that have not been conceived yet
 'chaar companiyaan bharat main ultrabuk pesh kar chuki hai
 Acer is the first company to enter the Indian market with its S3 Ultrabook
 iske baad lenovo ne you300es or echpi ne pholio13 pesh kii hai
 Asus introduced zenbook shortly after
 es3 kii keemat kareeb 48,000 ru
 And Zenbook's Rs 89,999

 Some more models are expected to arrive in India in the middle of the year, and it is being said that these will be the real game changers

 Samsung Series 5, Acer Aspire S5, HP NV14 Spectre, Samsung Series 9 and Dell XPS 13 are also coming
 lekin kuch log kehete hai ki ultrabux ko aap alag shrenee nahin maan sakate kyonki koi bhi utpaadak intel ke maanakon kaa puri tarah anusaran nahin kar rahaa he
 Experts have also given importance to the fact that the battery life of Ultrabooks which has come in the market is at the lowest level according to the Intel standard, while the battery life of up to 10 hours can be seen in others
 zyaadaatar ultrabux kii keemat bhi 1,000 dollar se zyada he
 But still there is a lot of hope that when you go to buy a laptop in the market, you will come back by buying Ultrabook
 aane vaale samay kii ultrabukane vaale kuch maheenon main aap ultrabux ke bare main bahut kuch sun paaenge kyonki computer banane vaali kai companiyaan nai kism kii is shrenee par apana dhyaan kendrit kar rahi hai
 At the moment you have very few models to choose from, but we can say with full confidence that the computing world is going to change from next June
 jahaan tak technology kii baat he, ultrabux 13 inch kii seemaa se nikal kar bade aakaar main dikhaai dene lagengi
 Since many customers are away from it due to the small size, Intel will bring 14-inch and 15-inch options to market with computer manufacturers
 pichley dinon las vegas main hue kanjumar electronics sho (siies) main intel ne 'tach' kii kshamta ko dikhaane vaale kuch prototip dikhaae the

 jaise hi windos 8 bazaar main aa jayega, aap yah dekhenge ki mobile computing divices main tach kii khubi lagjri na hokar ek jarurat kii vastu hogi
 Efforts will also be made to reduce the price of ultrabooks so that by the end of the year the market share of this new category can be increased to 40 per cent

 How Ultrabook differs from laptop 1
 procesar laptop ko aaj bhi ek maanak procesar kii talash he jabaki ultrabux main second janareshan ke aai5 or aai7 procesar hi honge
 2
 sies laptop kaa aakaar tay nahin he jabaki zyaadaatar ultrabux 13 inch kii hongi, isse badi nahin
 Their thickness will be half of the common laptop
 isliye ultrabux halki hongi
 3
 ports aam laptop main dikhaai dene vaale kai ports ultrabuk main nahin dikhaai denge
 The Ultrabook will have 2 USB and HDMI ports, not a VGA and Ethernet port
 4
 Design Ultrabooks have a unibody design to hold larger batteries, but few laptops can adopt such a body
 5
 Battery Ultrabooks have longer battery life
 adhikansh laptop kii bydaree 3 ghante se zyada nahin chalati jabaki ultrabux kii bydaree life kam se kam 5 ghante hoti he
 6
 storage ultrabux main storage ke liye solid state dryves (esasdes) hongi, jo inhen slim banane ke liye jaruri hai
 Because of SSD, they will start Ultrabooks in a short time

 He said, 'if i have been selected to play in all three formats in Team India, it is only because of speed
 pichley sijan main chotil hone ke baavjood raftaar kam karne kaa khyaal kabhi mere jehan main nahin aayaa
 "when the new season starts, there is talk of players adopting new techniques or styles, but Umesh says that no fast bowler can bring new things to his bowling other than the current methods
 umesh ne kaha, ‘mujhe bataaiye ki ek gendbaaj kya nayaa kar saktaa he jo aapane dekha na ho

 He said, 'short bowling on bouncy pitches in South Africa and Australia becomes easy

 It is better to bowl full on bouncy pitches as the batsman will think about driving
 ’is saal ke ant main team india ke dakshin africa daure ke bare main baat karte hue yadav is baat se khush the ki vah tej gendbaajon ke mureed pichon par khelenge
 Yadav said that the use of two new balls in odis is becoming very helpful for bowlers bowling with new balls
 unhone kaha, ‘yah acha he ki ab hamen vanade main do nai gend milti hai
 Even in the 40th and 42nd overs, the ball is almost 20 overs old

 Therefore, there has been some lethargy in the last one year
 kyonki ashraf gani kaa rujhaan pakistan kii taraf rahaa he
 He sent his army troops to Pakistan for training, allowing Pakistani intelligence agencies in Afghan jails to interrogate prisoners
 ye pakisathan ko khush karne kii kuch misaal he
 Prior to this, Karzai had sent the Afghan Army to India for training, which had gone to Pakistan exasperating
 lekin ab karaji or avam kaa bada hissaa ye sawaal uthaa rahaa he ki jo mulk taliban ko train karke afghanistan main hamalaa kar rahaa he wo hi sena ko train kare ye sahi nahin

 Because Ashraf Ghani is trending towards Pakistan
 unhone pakistan main apni sena kii tukadiyon ko training ke liye bheja, afgaan jelon main pakistani khufia agenciyon ko kaidiyon se poochtacha kii ijaajat di
 This is an example of making Pakistan happy
 iske pehle karaji ne bharat main afgaan army ko training ke liye bheja tha jo pakistan ko nagavar gujara tha
 But now a large part of Karzai and Awam is raising the question that the country that is training the Taliban and attacking in Afghanistan, it is only right to train the army

 ) It is a coincidence that in UPA-2, the need of a partner to save the sinking ship of UPA-1 is also felt by the Congress
 lekin kaam nikal jane ke baad hameshaa dutkaari jane vaali samaajawaadee party (sapa) is baar aitihaasik bahumat ke saath rajya kii satta main baithi he or apni majbootee ko behatar saudebaaji main badalane kii sthiti main he
 Hence, the Congress does not want to miss the opportunity to bring SP closer
 sansad ke bajet satr ke pehle din hi congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi kaa aage badhkar mulaayam ko badhai dena yaa akhilesh yadav ke shapath grahan samaaroh main na jane par fouran chitthee likhakar afsos jataane kii pahal, party kii ore se mulaayam ko saath laane kii koshishen jari hai
 Whether it is the changing attitude of Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee or dmk's resentment or Sharad Pawar's political bias among its allies, the Congress is becoming a soft necessity
 rail bajet main bade kiraye par mamata banerjee ke tikhe tewaron ke baad congress ke liye na sirf bajet satr main numberon kaa sameekaran banaakar rakhana he, balki aage bhi apni sarkaar ke number durust rakhane kii kadi chunauti he
 For this, all the Congress strategists including Sonia Gandhi are active on every front
 congress ne mulaayam kii manuval ke liye rajd supremeo lalu yadav ko bhi aage kiya he or yahi vajah he ki tisare morche kii sugabugahat ko lalu ne philhal khaarij kiya he
 But Mulayam is not opening his cards in the bitter experience and heartfelt desire to lead the Third Front

 According to the State Finance Department, due to not being in a state of debt repayment, the burden on the state is increasing
 yuva mukhyamantri akhilesh ke paas janata se kiye vaadon kii lambii fehrist he
 From the unemployment allowance to the loan waiver of the farmers, the government needs a large amount
 sabase ahm baat yah he ki congress thik usee vakt sankat main fansi he, jab sapa ko bhi kendriya sahaayta kii jarurat he
 Certainly, Mulayam is very cautious in this political environment and will not miss the opportunity, he will try to get irrigation packages for the state, special assistance for Bundelkhand and projects for electricity
 unhen maaloom he ki congress kii sarkaar or mamata ke bich jitani talkhiyaan badhengi, kendriya raajnneeti main unki ahmiyat utani hi badhegi
 But in order to bring the state of the economic situation back on track, Mulayam staring towards the center cannot even make a distance from the Congress
 sapa kaa adiyal rukh congress ko basapa ke najadik bhi le ja saktaa he
 The SP, which brought 39 mps to the 14th Lok Sabha, was not given due consideration by the Congress
 10 janpath par upie-vam morche kii pehali dinar party main taatkaaleen makapa mahasachiv harkishan singh surajeet ke saath gaye mulaayam-amar singh ko beabaru hokar lautnaa padaa
 But when the Left Front pulled back support on the nuclear deal issue, Mulayam not only supported the Congress by sidelining his friendship with the Left, but had successfully crossed over
 haalanki sapa ke ek varisht netaa dabi jubaan main kehete hai, 'pichley aath saal main mulaayam ne upie sarkaar ko hameshaa madad kii he, ab hisaab chukaane kii baari congress kii he
 Akhilesh's announcement that the Congress government will complete its term and the sp's support will continue, is an important part of the party's strategy after it was nominated as the Chief Minister
 saaf he ki maujuuda paridrishy main congress-sapa donon ko ek-duusare kii jarurat mahasoos ho rahi he
 But the results of Uttar Pradesh have given wings to Mulayam's intention of becoming the Prime Minister, so SP does not want to make himself a part of the government because doing so may prematurely initiate the initiative of the Third Front

 Do they not even have the right to live a dignified life on their shoulders to strengthen the foundation of India's future? This is reflected in the way the education workers are being treated during the strike from December 12 in Chhattisgarh
 yahaan, samaan kaam-samaan vetan kii maang kar rahe gurujanon ko khadeda ja rahaa he
 In order to get a respectable salary, the education workers who are on fast unto death and who are living in a low salary are being threatened by being suspended
 rajya shikshakarmi sangh ke sanchaalak sadsy sanjay sharma bataate hai, ''ek shikshakarmi kii patni ne jaan de di kyonki uske pati ko barkhaastagi kaa notice mila tha
 Five teachers involved in the strike were killed
 ''andolankariyon kii maane to sarkaar inhen beemaari ke kaaran hui maut bataakar bachanaa chaahati he
 Here, School Education Minister Brijmohan Agrawal still defends his government, saying, "the government has taken many decisions in the interest of education workers in the past
 use asamvedansheel maananaa galat he
 "the foundation of this movement was laid down with the teacher recruitment rule made during undivided Madhya Pradesh, due to which teachers were divided into two classes - regular or government teachers and teachers falling under local institutions like panchayats or municipal corporations
 , Who are called panchayat teachers or education workers
 niyamit shikshakon ke samaan vetan or panchayat se sarkaar main apane sanvilayan kii maang ko lekar pradesh ke hajaaron shikshakarmi raipur main parivaar sahit bemiyadi hadtaal par baithe hai
 Due to this, education has stopped in more than 40,000 schools
 primary or middle skulon kii haalat to or kharaab he kyonki vahaan 80 fisadi se zyada shikshakarmi hai
 The pain of education workers is that they are taken as much as regular teachers while they do not get even half the salary
 dharna sthal par baithe shikshak preetam sahu kehete hai, ''ab to koi or kaam bhi nahin kar sakate
 “equal pay-equal pay movement of education workers has been going on for a long time
 ve har saal do baar hadtaal karte hai or sarkaar vetan main thodi vruddhi kar detii he
 Due to this, in 2001, the salary of Shikshakarmi class-3 was Rs
 2,250
 prati maah tha jo ab 7,650 ru
 It is done
 is baar andolan main talkhi adhik hone kii khaas vajah he
 Elections are to be held next year in the state, in such a situation, the education workers feel that their pulses may melt
 vipaksh bhi is mudde ko bhunaa rahaa he
 The Congress created a ruckus in the Assembly for two days over the demands of the Panchayat teachers
 vipaksh ke netaa rabindra choube kehete hai, ''raman sarkaar ne panchayat shikshakon ke saath vaadakhilaphi kii he
 The BJP had said in its manifesto that the demands of education workers will be fulfilled as soon as the government is formed, but now fearing suspension and dismissal is being created in them
 '' shikshakarmiyon ko samarthan dene pahunche purv mukhyamantri ajit jogi ne congress kii sarkaar aate hi sabase pehle unke sanvilayan kaa bharosa diya
 It is another matter that even during his tenure himself, the education workers got lathis
 shikshakarmi sanvilayan kii maang jarur kar rahe hai lekin panchayat vibhaag main sachiv rahe ek aalaa iees adhikari kii maane to yah aasaan nahin he
 According to him, the employer of education workers is the panchayat and the employer cannot be changed
 vaise bhi pradesh main niyamit shikshakon ke cader ko khatm kar diya gaya he, aise main sawaal yah bhi he ki sanvilayan kismen kiya jayega
 Regular teachers are retiring and they are being replaced by education workers
 saarvajanik rup se shikshakarmiyon kaa samarthan kar rahi congress ke hi ek varisht netaa dabi jubaan se kehete hai, ''vetan main visangati to he lekin unki maang isliye jaij nahin he kyonki sarkari shikshakon kaa cader khatm ho gaya he
 "but the education workers are in a decisive mood, that's why the movement continues unabated despite the death of five education workers
" sanjay sharma kehete hai, ''jab tak sari maangen puri nahin hongi, andolan khatm nahin hoga
 This will be the last and decisive battle
 '' lekin sarkaar bhi naram padati nahin dikh rahi
 Panchayat Minister Hemchand Yadav says, "the Chhattisgarh government is paying higher salaries to education workers than other states
" ''baharhaal, sarkaar ne shikshakarmiyon se baatcheet karne ke liye mantrimandal kii upasmiti kaa gathan kiya he
 The committee comprises School Education Minister Brijmohan Agrawal, Panchayat Minister Hemchand Yadav, Higher Education Minister Ramvichar Netam and Tribal Minister Kedar Kashyap
 lekin andolankaaree shikshak isse santusht nahin hai or ise khanaapurti bhar qaraar dete hai
 In the last 12 years, different governments had formed 15 committees on the issue of education workers, but the result was cipher
 dekhen, ek or cameti kya rang laati he? Narendra Modi, bjp's prime ministerial candidate, said in a rally held in Himachal on Sunday that the arrogance of the ruling Congress government at the center is at seventh time

 Its leaders do not speak anything on inflation
 modi ne congressiyon se sawaal poochhate hue kaha ki 100 din main mahangaai ghataane ke daawey kaa aakhir kya hua
 The Congress accuses them of cultivating poison, whereas in fact it is Congress who cultivates poison
 bijepito pyaar kii kheti karti he
 He said that the Congress specializes in the cultivation of poison, an example of this is the separation of Andhra Pradesh from Telangana
 modi ne congress par hamalaa bote hue kaha ki aajkal main chaay ke bare main baat karata hum to kuch logon ko mirch lagatihai
 He said that nowadays people start hating me and have even started abusing tea
 modi ne congress paratikha hamalaa bolte hue kaha ki congress ek vanshavaadi party he or wo loktantr kii dushman he
 Modi said that those who pay taxes honestly, who have served the country, who work on salary, but who work for the country, we will benefit
 videshon se kalaadhan laakar ham in eemaandaar logon ke bich uskaa ekahissaa baant denge
 If anyone is the mother of corruption in the country, then it is only Congress
 agar congressiyon ne bhrashtachar nahinkia he to ve videshon main jamaa kaledhan ko kyon nahin laate
 Modi attacked the Center and the Himachal government, saying that today Himachal farmers do not get the price of apples
 ve videshon se fasal mangate hai, lekin yahaan ke kisaanon ko uchit keemat nahin milti
 He said that when Himachal's son wakes up, the country sleeps peacefully
 modi ne pradhanmantri manmohan singh ke us bayaan par bhi tanj ksaa, jisamen unhone kaha tha ki paise ped par nahin lagate
 Modi said that Himachal Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh's income has increased 14 times in 3 years
 or unhone poochne parbataya ki unki aamadani seb ke pedo se badi he
 Attacking the central government, Modi said that the government's attitude towards railways has always been indifferent, whereas railways could have become the strength of the country
 railway ke network ko majboot karne kii jarurat he
 Railways will give a boost to the tourism industry in Himachal
