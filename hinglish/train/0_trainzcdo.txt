 ' Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal targeted the NDA government for demanding full statehood and said that it is necessary to have a big-hearted government at the center to focus on this issue
 unhone kaha, ab hamen dekhnaa hoga ki kya maujuuda sarkaar bada dil dikhaaegi yaa agali sarkaar dikhaaegi
 Kejriwal said that the Center of Delhi's public income tax as 1
 30 lakh karod rupee detii he, lekin badale main use keval 350 karod rupee milte hai
 Kejriwal said, even the British had not looted Delhi the way the Center has looted
 unhone kaha ki agar centre dilli ko purna rajya kaa darja nahin dena chahta, to use nai dilli nagar palika parishad (endiemasi) ke antargat aane vaale ilaakon, uski jameen or police adhikaron ko apane paas rakhana chahie or dilli ke nagar nigamon ke antargat aane vaale kshetra, unki jameen or police adhikaar dilli sarkaar ko de dene chahie
 The comments mukhyamantri ne kaha, sabhi dal kehete hai ki dilli ko purna rajya kaa darja diya janaa chahie
 They promise this in their election manifestos and after winning the election they say that is not what we really meant
 log aksar majaak udaate hai ki tum aadhe rajya ke ek-chauthai mukhyamantri ho
 Kejriwal said, BJP came to power in 1993, Congress was at the center
 dilli main congress kii sarkaar ai to bijepi centre main thi
 Then for 10 years, the Congress was in power at both the Center and Delhi
 kisi bhi vakt centre ne dilli par se apana adhikaar nahin choda
 He said, now we have to see whether the present government will show big heart or the next government will show
 kejariwal ne kaha ki dilli kii janata iskar ke rup main centre ko 1
 30 lakh crore, but in return he gets only 350 crore rupees
 kejariwal ne kaha, itnaa to angrejon ne bhi dilli ko nahin lutaa tha, jis tarah centre ne lutaa he
 He said that if the Center does not want to give full statehood status to Delhi, it should retain the areas, its land and police rights under the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) and those under the Municipal Corporations of Delhi The Delhi government should give the area, their land and police rights
 tippaniyan The Chief Minister said, all parties say that Delhi should be given full state status

 kejariwal ne kaha, saal 1993 main bijepi satta main ai, centre main congress thi
 When the Congress government came to Delhi, the BJP was at the center
 phir 10 saal tak congress centre or dilli donon jagah satta main thi
 At no point did the center relinquish its authority over Delhi
 unhone kaha ki agar centre dilli ko purna rajya kaa darja nahin dena chahta, to use nai dilli nagar palika parishad (endiemasi) ke antargat aane vaale ilaakon, uski jameen or police adhikaron ko apane paas rakhana chahie or dilli ke nagar nigamon ke antargat aane vaale kshetra, unki jameen or police adhikaar dilli sarkaar ko de dene chahie

 Some speak less, some are more, some are fearless and some are shy
 aksar dekha gaya he ki sharmile swabhaav vaale log pyaar ke maamle main zyada bolne vaale logon kii apeksha peeche rah jate hai
 But despite this, their prospects do not completely end

 At the same time, they are often afraid to express love
 magar apane aacharan main agar wo kuch badlaav le aaen to ye samasya chutkiyon main dur ho sakati he
 Let us know some such tips which even shy people can adopt and prove to be successful in the matter of love

 a good start is a conversation
 mazaakia andaaj-ladakiyon ko hansi majaak karne vaale ladke zyada bhaate hai
 It has also been seen many times that the sense of humor is very good for those who speak less
 ye gun aapke andar he to ye ek plus point he, agar nahin he to phir aapako maahaul ko halke andaaj main mazaakia banane kii koshish kerani chahie
 You can also start it by hitting yourself

 For those with premature ejaculation, it is a boon to do this exercise - girls love to hear compliments
 agar aap unki dress yaa luks kii tarif karte hai to unhen khushi milti he
 You should also praise something like this
 yah saamne vaale ko bhi aapke prati or sahaj banayega
 Do not forget to approach for further - whatever your date has been, do not be afraid to ask about the next date
 sambhaavnaaen tabhi rahengi jab aap dobaaraa us shaks se mulaakaat kar paaenge
 It may be that the person in front has liked you and is willing to spend more time with you

 (that too when the meeting was called a day before the scheduled date
 ) asal main kaaryakarini ke zyaadaatar sadsy do ghante pehle hi pahunch chuke the

 Presenting the live report of AAP executive from Ramlila Maidan
 arvind kejariwal- saathiyon
 
 
 (on understanding the signs, a worker brings ginger coffee
 log baithne ke liye kehete hai
 Health is not well, so Kejriwal agrees with the people
 mag se ek-do ghunt coffee pine ke baad bolnaa shuru karte hai
 ) Friends, i have said that i do not get into this quarrel
 mujhe dilli par focus karnaa he
 We cannot play with people's expectations
 par ek baat main phir se saaf kar dena chahta hum
 Earlier i used to often say, "I have no place
" " ye 'aap' kaaryakartaaon ke liye sabase bada mantra he
 Meanwhile, i stopped using it
 mujhe laga sab log is baat ko samaj gaye honge
 But it seems that some people have not understood this
 'aap' kaaryakartaaon ke man main hardam ye baat goonjati rahani chahie - 'meri koi aukaat nahin he
 'you are understanding, not the honorable member of' AAP '
 jab tak aap log ye mantra aatmsaat kiye rahenge tab tak 'aap' kaa bhala hoga
 We are completely different from other parties
 hamen unki tarah nahin bananaa
 We respect democracy
 main aap ko samajhaana chahta hum ki 'sab log aukaat main rahen' lekin main aisa bhashaa ke istemaal se parhez karata hum
 Admiral Ramdas - i have written a few questions
 main chaahunga ki un sawaalon kaa
 
 
 (sanjay Singh interrupts) Sanjay Singh- Question is gone
 jab netaji ne kah diya ki sab log aukaat main rahen to phir sawaal kis baat ke
 What questions? There is no need to raise questions here
 jise sawaal uthaanaa he wo jaakar media main sawaal uthaae
 When Netaji explained 'okat wali baat' to you in simple words, what is the confusion then? This is not only a mantra for workers - this is our party line
 party line bole to - party kii tagaline
 Everyone understood
 (kejariwal chup rahete hai
 Perhaps he believes that everyone has the right to speak
 isliye sanjay singh tab tak bolte hai jab tak unka man karata he
 ) Prashant Bhushan- Look, i mean to say that
 
 
 (prashanth bhushan ko bich main kaat kar ashish khetaan shuru ho jate hai
 In democracy, everyone is allowed to speak
 aakhir isi loktantric dhaanche se hi to sanghathan majboot rahete hai
 Kejriwal may have said this, he would have kept quiet
 )ashish khetaan- dekhie, ye koi dely dialog kaa forum nahin he
 Here we have gathered to discus serious issues
 sawaal ye nahin he ki kisne chitthee likhakar kya sawaal uthaae hai
 The question is that people start asking questions, which made us worthy to ask questions
 ab ye kya sawaal he ki arvind kejariwal ko ek saath do padon par nahin rahanaa chahie
 Chief Minister, he is only by name
 asli mukhyamantri to manish sisodiya hi hai
 Who has all the Ministries? (people sitting in the meeting speak together, 'to the Honorable Manish Sisodia Ji')
 manish sisodiya khetaan kii baat par halkaa sa muskaraate hai phir gambhir ho jate hai
 Perhaps they understand the fragility of time properly
 ashish khetaan jari rahete hai
 ) Ashish Khaitan- Then, what does it mean to ask questions? Look, i appeal to all of you to join hands and stop these unnecessary questions and get involved in work
 dely dialog main badi mehnat hui he, tabhi ye natite hasil hue hai
 Some people do not trash it together
 arvind ne saaf saaf kah diya he ki aukaat main rahanaa he to rahanaa he varanaa ye khulaa maidan he
 Do not search for the door to go out
 (kinare baithe ashutosh uthakar khadey hote hai or ghoshnaa karte hai
 Now it's time for a break
 milte hai brake ke baad
 ) Arvind Kejriwal- i have great respect for Yogendra Yadav
 thodi umr zyada hoti to unhen annaji kii tarah pita jaisaa bhi bataane main parhez nahin karata
 Yogendra ji and Prashant ji are like my elder brother, just like Kiran Bedi ji is like my elder sister
 main sabhi kaa annaji kii tarah hi sammaan karata hum
 (sanjay Singh has been searching for a cut-point in Arvind Kejriwal's talk for quite a while
 mauka milte hi tapaak se uth khadey hote hai
 ) Sanjay Singh again- Thank you Netaji
 doston, ab aap sabhi ko ek tepe sunaaya jayega
 Playing it on life, one of our companions has recorded it in a sting operation
 is tepe main yogendra yadav ji range haath pakade gaye hai
 i demand from the executive that Yogendra Yadav should be removed immediately from the Public Affairs Committee
 hame pataa he ki ye sajeesh wo akele nahin rach sakate
 Prashant Bhushan will also have a hand in it
 isliye prashanth bhushan ko bhi piesi se baahar kiya jaae
 (tape is played
 soshal media par ye tepe pehle hi viral ho chukaa he
 Even then people listen to the tape with full vigor
 )yogendra yadav- mere mitra sanjay singh ji
 
 
 Sanjay Singh- You have no need to call me a friend
 jo arvind kaa dushman ho wo meraa mitra bilkul nahin ho saktaa
 i will tell phir se meraa naam mat liyo
 It is good to stay in position
 ye party kaa tagaline he or har kisi ko ise maananaa jaruri he
 One who does not believe it will be considered guilty of indiscipline
 yogendra yadav- main aapaki baat maanata hum
 i just want to say that
 
 
 ashish khetaan- aap kya kahana chaahate hai, ye hamako maaloom he
 But you are not doing what you are doing
 aap party line ko cross kar rahe hai
 You are forgetting 'okat'
 yogendra yadav- bhai main to bas itnaa
 
 
 Ashish Khaitan - There is no need to tell me your brother
 jo arvind kaa bhai nahin wo meraa bhai kaise ho saktaa he
 Neither do i need a brother like you nor did the party make any difference
 main bataa rahaa hum aapako
 You are going away from the party line again
 (ramdaas or yogendra yadav ek duusare kii ore dekhte hai
 The questions are the same in both eyes
 tabhi manish sisodiya uth khadey hote hai
 ) Manish Sisodia - Friends, Arvind is a bit unwell
 unhen aaraam kii jarurat he
 We will meet again after Arvind returns from leave
 aap sabhi kaa bahut bahut dhanyavad
 (manish Sisodia looks at Kejriwal
 donon gaadi kii ore bad jate hai
 Ramdas and Yogendra get their eye once again
 ankhon main sawaal ab bhi maujuud hai
 Is the party's tagline answering the questions? a new question has arisen

 ek taraf baba virendra dev dikshit kaa ashram lagaataar police kii najaron main he, to duusari ore virendra dikshit ke bhakton or chaahane waalon ke bich bhi baba ko lekar ek badi diwaar khinch gai he
 Let us tell you the story of two brothers of a family of Banda, whose two brothers Baba Virendra Dev have taken different paths with Dixit
 ajtak kii team ne banda ke kalmodi gaanv kaa daura kiya
 The family of two brothers Bhaiyalal Kushwaha and Babulal Kushwaha were found in that village and the girls of these two brothers and their families have spent more than a decade in the ashrams of Baba Virendra Dev Dixit
 bhaiya laal kushvaha apni patni bahu or beti ko ashram se nikaal laae, jabaki babulal kushvaha parivaar aaj bhi ashram se jude hai or utani hi atoot aasthaa ke saath
 Bhaiyyalal's family has named the girls and other members of his house in the ashram and passed on to Baba Virendra Dev Dixit
 ab vahi parivaar baba par hue khulaase ke baad virendra dev dikshit ko rakshas jaise shabdon se navaj rahaa he
 Bhaiya Lal Kushwaha says that Vivendra Dixit is a devil disguised as a human, who believes himself to be God
 uske ashram main galat kaam hote he
 According to Bhaiya Lal, the women of the ashram told about Virendra Dixit that he had a wrong relationship with girls, which he does by revealing himself as God
 bhaiyalaal virendra dikshit se itane naaraaz hai ki ab vah gaanv-gaanv gum-ghumkar paakhandee baba kii pole kholane par utaaru he
 Bhaiyyala wants Baba to be severely punished
 is canamodi gaanv main bhaiya laal kushvaha ke bhai babulal kushvaha hai, jo aaj bhi virendra dev dikshit ke andhbhakt hai
 According to him, Virendra Dev Dixit is a god, not a human being, and when God is in the form of a human being, his test is taken and at the moment his examination is going on
 aane vaale vakt main duniya maanegi ki vah bhagwaan he
 However, she has devout families in many villages in Banda, with dozens of girls living in their different ashrams
 baba par pad rahe chhaapon ke baad in pariwaron main chintaa he or ilaake main kautuhal ki kahin virendra dev dikshit kaa hashr bhi baba ram rahim jaisaa naa ho
 The Supreme Court has once again refused to grant bail to Asaram, who is jailed on charges of raping a minor
 is maamle kii agali sunwaayee ab 28 november ko kii jaaegi
 Asaram, currently jailed on charges of raping a minor, does not seem to get any relief from the Supreme Court at present
 somvaar ko asaram kii jamaanat arji par sunwaayee karte hue adaalat ne asaram ko jamaanat dene se inkaar kar diya
 During the hearing, the Gujarat government strongly opposed Asaram's bail
 rajya sarkaar ne supreme court ko bataaya ki ahmedabad dushkarm maamle main din-pratidin trial chalanaa he
 The trial process will be completed in 6 months
 lihaaja aaropee asaram ko jamaanat na di jaae
 After which the court fixed the next hearing of the case on 28 November
 bataa den ki asaram ke vakeelon ne unki kharaab sehat kaa hawala dete hue jamaanat kii maang kii thi
 Significantly, Asaram is in jail for raping a minor girl from his own ashram
 asaram ne isse pehle bhi swasthya aadhaar par 1 se 2 maheene kiantarim jamaantki maang kii thi
 After which the Supreme Court ordered the creation of a medical board for his health check-up
 asaram ke vakeelon ne court se kaha ki is maamle main media trial ho rahaa he, isliye media report par court roak lagaae
 But the court refused to do so
 lokapal kii niyukti ko lekar centre sarkaar or congress aamane-saamne hai
 Mallikarjun Kharge, the leader of Congress in the Lok Sabha, has turned down the invitation of the Central Government, in which he was invited to the meeting to appoint the Lokpal
 lokapal kii niyukti kii baithak aaj hi he
 Let us know that the second part of the budget session of Parliament is starting from March 5
 darasal congress kii aapatti is baat ko lekar he ki lokapal ke chayan ko lekar jo baithak bulaai gai he usamen khadge ko netaa pratipaksh kii jagah special aamantrit sadsy ke taur par bulaayaa gaya he
 Mallikarjun Kharge has written a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, alleging that the central government is not listening to the opposition
 vipaksh ko apni baat kehane kaa mauka nahin diya ja rahaa he
 Kharge wrote that the track record of Prime Minister Modi as Chief Minister of Gujarat shows that he is not serious about an institution like Lokpal
 congress ke is rukh ke saath hi ek baar phir lokapal kii niyukti par sankat chaa gaya he
 Four days before the commencement of the Parliament session, the government has called a meeting of the selection committee for the Lokpal so that a consensus can be reached in the name of the Lokpal
 lokapal kii sellection cameti main piem modi, loksabhaa kii spikar sumitra mahajan, desh ke mukhya nyaayadhish or loksabhaa main congress ke netaa mallikarjun khadge (special guest) shaamil hai
 Kharge wrote that if my vote, opinion and logic does not matter in this meeting, then there is no justification for joining the meeting as a 'special guest'
 unhone kaha ki congress sarkaar ne lokapal bill paas kiya tha, lekin uske baavjood modi sarkaar ajtak lokapal kii niyukti nahin kar pai he
 Let us tell you that Kilokpal Billco was introduced in Rajya Sabha on 13 December 2013, which was passed on 17 December 2013
 iske baad 18 disambar 2013 ko loksabhaa ne bhi is bill ko paas kar diya tha
 After this, on December 18, PM Modi (then Gujarat CM) tweeted and credited BJP mps for passing the bill along with Sushma Swaraj and Arun Jaitley
 gauratlab he kismajasevi anna hajaareki aguwai main 2011 main dilli ke ramlila maidan main kaaphi bada andolan hua tha

 In this, it was decided to enact a law on Lokayukta and Citizen Charter at the center at the earliest

 a thoughtful attempt has been made to erase the legacy of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose and Azad Hind Fauz from history
 netaji ke rishtedaaron kii kathith jasusi kii khabaron ke bich unke bhattije aradhendu bose ne ye aarope lagaaya he
 Ardhendu, who lives in the posh Colaba area of mumbai, also told in a special conversation with NDTV India that many of the letters to his house in Worli were also investigated earlier
 aradhendu kaa ye bhi kahana tha ki unke pita ne unhen bataaya tha ki kolkata main rahane vaale unke kai rishtedaaron ke phone tap kiye jate the
 Ardhendu, a leather businessman from Mumbai, said, "since 1947, with Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose, an attempt has been made to erase the name and work of the Azad Hind Fauj, in any book of history, Bose, of the Indian National Army Not to mention
 ’ mumbai main janme aradhendu bombai daaing ke purv model rahe hai
 His father Shailesh Chandra was Netaji's younger brother, who died in 1984
 aradhendu kaa kahana he ki unka parivaar is baat ko maanata he, jisaki pushti vaajapeyi ke pradhanmantri rahane ke dauraan mukherjee kamishan ne bhi kii thi ki 18 agast 1945 ke din koi vimaan durghatnagrast nahin hua tha
 Netaji may have gone to Russia via kolkata-afghanistan but Stalin probably sent him to Siberia for his far-reaching benefits where he died around 1957
 aradhendu chaahate hai ki pradhanmantri narendra modi, netaji subhash chandra bose se jude saare dastavejon ko gupta suchi se hataa den taaki puure desh ko netaji or unki maut se judi sachai ke bare main pataa chal sake
 On this issue, Netaji's grandson Surya Bose also met Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Berlin
 manishankar ayyar (mani Shankar Aiyar) ne kaha ki agar rahul gandhi party adhyaksh bane rahete hai to yah sabase acha hoga, lekin saath hi rahul kii ichchhaaon kaa bhi sammaan hona chahie
 He said, 'I am convinced that even if there is no nehru-gandhi president of the party, our existence will continue, provided the nehru-gandhi family remains active in the party and helps in resolving such a crisis where serious differences arise
 'varisht congress netaa ne kaha ki rahul gandhi ne adhyaksh pad ke liye koi anya vikalp dhundne ke liye ek maheene kaa vakt diya he or is mudde ko lekar congress ke bheetar baatcheet jari he jahaan party main zyaadaatar log rahul ke pad par bane rahane ke paksh main hai
 However, the former Union Minister insisted that instead of speculating the media should wait for the 'deadline' to know whether an alternative has been found or Rahul has been persuaded to continue as Congress President
 
 ayyar ne kaha, 'mujhe nahin lagata ki yah vyaktitv kaa maamla he
 i know that the goal of the BJP is Gandhi Mukt Congress and consequently Congress Mukt Bharat
 mere vichaar main ham us soch ke jaal main funsane vaale nahin hai ki unhone kuch aisa pataa laga liya he jise khoj paane main ham asamarth hai
 Asked about the need for a reshuffle in the top leadership of the organization, the 78-year-old Iyer said, "if you will behead you, the torso will flutter
" ' ayyar ne party ke itihaas se aise kai udhaaharan pesh kiye jab nehru-gandhi parivaar se baahar ke log party ke adhyaksh rahe, you en dhebar se lekar brahmanand reddy tak
 He said that this model can still be adopted
 trinmul congress netaaon ne haal main hi bijepi main shaamil netaa mukul roy ko gaddaar bataaya he

 According to news agency PTI, senior Trinamool leader and Kolkata Municipal Corporation Mayor Sovan Chatterjee said that the party did not care about Roy
 sowan chatarji ne kaha, ‘hamaare paas us vyakti ke bare main sochane kaa vakt nahin he jiskaa apana koi janaadhar nahin he

 He claimed that the people of West Bengal wanted an alternative to Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and would vote for the BJP in the next election

 Mukul Roy, who was once close to Mamata Banerjee and now holds the bjp's lotus, has been mentioned in two big cases
 sabase pehle inkaa naam sharada scam main aayaa tha or is maamle main mukul se sibiai bhi poochtacha kar rahi he
 To stop Mukul's arrest, Mamata Banerjee herself started making statements and blamed the Modi government at the Center for the case
 trinmul congress ke ek anya netaa or rajya mantrimandal ke sadsy farhaad hakim ne roy ko agle vidhansabha chunaav main trinmul sarkaar ko apdasth karne kaa sapana nahin dekhne kii salaah di, kyonki unke anusaar yah unke liye duswapn sabit hoga
 Hakim said, "he is a traitor who betrayed the people of West Bengal
" vah trinmul ko koi nuksaan nahin pahunchaa paaenge
 Our party's command is in Mamta's hands
 sapana dekhnaa acha he, usamen koi nuksaan nahin he, lekin unke sapane kahin duswapn main badal nahin jaae

 Ray says that women with breast cancer are also at increased risk of uterine cancer, because having the same type of gene is more likely to cause both types of cancer
 unhone bataaya, "cancer ke liye jin uttaradaayi hote hai
 We have seen that there has been an increase in uterine cancer cases in the last few years due to increasing cases of breast cancer
 ames main bhi kai aise maamle aae hai, jahaan mahilaon main donon tarah ke cancer paae gaye hai
 "actually, the Timur produced from the BRCA-1 and BRCA-2 genes found in humans suppresses proteins
 donon main se kisi ek jin main jab badlaav aata he, yani vah thik se kaam nahin karata, to usase kshatigrast diene kii marammat nahin ho paati he
 This results in additional genetic changes in the cells, which can lead to cancer

 If they do not work, the risk of cancer increases
 isliye stan cancer se peedit marij main garbhashay cancer kaa khatra bana rahata he
 Similarly, uterine cancer patients are at risk of breast cancer
 "biarsie-1 or biarsie-2 main khaastaur se vanshanugat parivartan se stan or garbhashay cancer kaa khatra sabase zyada hota he
 Apart from this, there is also the risk of many other types of diseases including uterine placenta, pancreas cancer
 dow
 Ray said that earlier it was believed that most women over 50 years of age suffer from breast and uterine cancer, but now cases of breast and uterine cancer are increasing among women below 35 years
 unhone kaha ki jeevanstyli kharaab hone ke kaaran mahilaayein cancer se peedit ho rahi hai
 If one or two members of a family are suffering from breast or uterine cancer, then all women in the family should undergo BRCA-1 and BRCA-2
 saath hi, stan or garbhashay cancer kii jaanch jald karaani chahie
 If a woman's mother had breast cancer at the age of 45, then she should start mammography at the age of 35

 pehali baar bollywood ke teen khan ek hi sijan main karan johar ke is sho main najar aane vaale hai jo is sho ke itihaas main pehali baar hone ja rahaa he
 The first episode of 'koffee with Karan' started with Shah Rukh Khan
 uske baad is sho ke 100 wein episod main is ravivaar ko aap salmaan khan ko unke bhaiyon ke saath dekhne vaale hai or ab yah saaf ho gaya he ki aamir khan jald hi apni onscreen betiyon fatima sanaa shaikh or sanaaya malhotra ke saath is sho par aane vaale hai

 Recently, at a fashion show, Aamir was asked why he was not part of the show
 is par aamir ne kaha tha ki karan unhen sho par bula hi nahin rahe hai
 It seems that after Aamir's blitz, Karan became clear that Aamir, who is often away from TV shows etc
 for film promotion, is ready to come on this show for 'dangal'
 isse saaf he ki karan ke is sho main teenon khaanon kii maujuudagi unke sho ke liye kaaphi acchhee sabit hone vaali hai
 Ever since Aamir is promoting the film Dangal, he goes nowhere without his two daughters onscreen
 yahi kaaran he ki is sho par bhi aamir unke saath hi dikhaai denge
 Aamir's film Dangal is set to release on 23rd December
 yah film haryana ke pahalwaan mahavir singh phogat par aadhaarit he jiskaa kirdaar aamir khan nibhaa rahe hai

 It is clear that the presence of the three Khans in this show of Karan is going to prove to be very good for his show
 jab se aamir film dangal kaa pramotion kar rahe hai, vah apni onscreen donon betiyon ke bina kahin nahin jate hai
 This is the reason that Aamir will also appear with him on this show as well

 log 80 rupye kaa gulab kharidte vakt bhi ek baar bhi dobaaraa nahin sochate
 In this day, materialistic values should be allowed at least in the middle
 'ek privet form main kaam karne vaaleen bipasha chakravarti ne kaha, 'ye anivaary nahin hota ki vailentins de par gulab bhent hi kiye jaaen
 If what you think about each other, even if it is told to the tongue, it makes the same effect
 varshon pehle jab log gulab nahin dete the to kya pyaar kaa kam asar hota tha yaa use saraahaa nahin jaataa tha
 Nowadays the show is more
 gulab dena galat nahin he lekin behatar se behatar se dene kii hode prem kii nishchal bhaavana ke khilaaf he
 'but sir, these are all matters of mind
 muhabbat dimag kii nahin dil kii suna karti he
 If all is fair in love and war, what is the problem for the hearts even with the prize war of roses? The meaning of the color and fragrance of each rose is told differently
 pile gulab kaa matlab he ki jode kaa bandhan cement kii tarah hameshaa atoot rahegaa
 The demand for red roses is the highest on Valentine's Day, it means to express love
 isi tarah safed or nile gulab ke bhi apane-apane myne bataae jate hai
 Since the Cambridge Analytica scandal, new information is constantly coming up in the context of Facebook
 fasebuk ne ab mana he ki company unke founder or siio mark jakarberg dwaara bheje gaye massej gupt tareeke se delit kar kar rahi he
 The new techcrunch report quoted three independent sources as saying that the old Facebook messages sent by Zuckerberg were disappearing secretly from their inboxes, while their own replies are present

 company kaa kahana he ki 2014 main soni pikchars ke i-mail hack hone ke baad hamane kai badlaav kiye hai, taaki hamaare adhikariyon ke samvaad ko surakshit rakhaa ja sake
 The rest of Facebook users cannot do this
 saath hi company kii ore se massej delit karne ke sandarbh main pehle koi jaankaree nahin di gai thi
 The most important fact is that the terms and conditions of the company itself does not give the company freedom to do so unless someone violates the Community Standards
 isse pehle jaankaree mili thi ki fasebuk ne ek bayaan main kaha he ki lagbhag 87 million yugers kaa data cambridge analitica ke saath share kiya gaya he, jisamen zyaadaatar america yugers hai
 This is the first time Facebook has clearly accepted that data from Indian users has also been shared with Cambridge Analytica
 fasebuk ke mutabik lagbhag 5 lakh 62 hajaar bhartiya yugers kaa data cambridge analitica ke saath share kiya gaya he
 The company has released a list that contains the names and percentages of countries where users' data is incorrectly shared with Cambridge Analytica
 is lystom main bharat kaa number 7waan he or sabhi yugers main se 0
 Data from 6% of Indian users has been shared

 chunki wo mantri ki mehmaan thim, lihaaza mandir prashasan ko arunima ke aane ke bare main pehle hi bataa diya gaya tha
 i am very sorry to tell you that i did not feel so sad to go to Everest
 Winning happened to me at Mahakal Temple Ujjain and made fun of my divinity

 Many actors change religion for one night

 bajra kaa nunatam samarthan mulya 1425 se badhaakar 1950 rupee prati quintal kar diya gaya he
 That is 96 at the cost of millet
 97% zyaada
 Announcing the decision, Rajnath Singh said that after independence, such a huge increase was not made in the minimum support price
 unhone kaha ki isse kisaanon kii kamai badhegi
 This is an important step towards doubling farmers' earnings by 2022
 fasal kii kul laagat ke akalan main beej, khaad, kitnashak, mashinari or mazaduri aadi shaamil hai
 But the price of land is not in it
 congress pravaktaa randeep surajevaala ne ye sawaal uthaaya or kaha ki fasalon kii laagat kaa akalan karne kaa sarkaar kaa formula galat he
 The comments jawaab main kendriya mantri harsimrat badal ne enditivi se kaha ki laagat ke akalan main bhoomi ke kharch ko shaamil karnaa sambhav nahin he kyonki har rajya main zamin kii keemat alag he
 He told NDTV, "how can the price of land in Punjab and Rajasthan be the same? Uniform estimation of land expenditure at the national level is not possible
 rashtriya str par kisi bhi fasal kii paidaavaar laagat main zamin kaa kharch shaamil karnaa sambhav nahin he

 The Delhi Police is now conducting security checks of those entering the house
 pehle sirf siarpief jaanch kar rahi thi
 Significantly, last month, a case of lapse in security of Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi came to light
 siarpief kii suraksha ke baavjood chandrasekhar tyaagi car lekar congress mahasachiv ke ghar main ghus gaya tha
 Priyanka Gandhi confirmed the incident with NDTV
 yah ghatana 25 november ko hui thi
 Priyanka Gandhi's office raised this issue with the CRPF
 sutron ne NDTV ko bataaya ki priyanka gandhi ke ghar ke bageeche ke paas bane baraamde main ek ladki sahit paanch log car lekar ghus gaye the
 Getting off the car, they all went to Priyanka Gandhi's garden and posed for a photo with the Congress leader
 sutron ne kaha ki yah parivaar uttar pradesh ke ek shahar se unke saath photo clic karne ke liye aayaa tha
 Priyanka Gandhi was surprised by this incident
 aapako pradesh ke kisi rajnatik dal ke mahila sanghathan se judi kisi padaadhikari kaa naam yaad he? kya aapane chauraahon, mohallon main lage party ke bade-bade hordingon main mahila sanghathan se judi kisi netaa kaa chitra dekha he? kya aapako haal main in mahila sanghathanon ke kisi bade kaarykram kii yaad he? sambhawatah aapkaa jawaab 'na' main hoga
 This is also a reality
 pradesh kii aadhi aabaadi ko uskaa haq dilaane kii alambardaar partiyon ke bheetar unki mahila shakhaon kii sthiti bahut acchhee nahin he
 She is going through an identity crisis, she is not getting the required attention even within the party
 pehle pradesh ke mukhya vipakshi dal samaajawaadee party kii mahila shakha samaajawaadee mahila sabha kii charchaa karte hai
 It has a 41-member state executive headed by Chairman Lilavati Kushwaha
 aadhe se zyada jilon main yah sanghathan punarnirmaan ke daur se guzar rahaa he
 a new district president has been appointed and tasked to set up new women committees
 beeti july main samaajawaadee mahila sabha kii kaaryakartaaon ne rajdhani kii sadakon par mahangaai ke khilaaf pradarshan kiya tha, jisamen party ke purush netaaon ne bhi shirkat kii thi
 Since then, the sp's women's organization has not made any presence in political circles except for sporadic protests at the district level
 par kushvaha kaa maananaa he, ''mahila sabha kii padaadhikari mahilaon ko party se jodne kaa nirantar abhiyaan chalaa rahi hai
 "recently, in any major event of Samajwadi Party or on the revolution chariot of SP state president Akhilesh Yadav, who is roaming in the state these days, the SP Mahila Sabha officials were not given a place among the big leaders
 mukhya aayojanon se ve nadaarad raheen
 But Kushwaha denies this and says, "netaji (mulayam Singh Yadav) has fixed the responsibility of all the workers, working accordingly
 '' kushvaha bhale hi upeksha kii baat na sweekaaren, lekin beete dinon unke sanghathan main virodh ke kai swar uthe hai
 a few months ago, his state vice-president Parveen Ayub Idrisi joined the Peace Party by accusing the party of familyism
 unka aarope he, ''sapa main mahilaon ko ek pad dekar baitha diya jaataa he
 No responsibility is given
 ''tikat bantwaare ke baad upje asantosh kii aanch samaajawaadee mahila shakha main bhi dikhi
 Sushma Jatav, district president of the assembly in Farrukhabad resigned from the party
 ve kaaymganj surakshit seat se tikat na milane se behad naaraaz thim
 His charge was, "the party has not given any permission for his 20 years of hard work
" '' sapa ne ummidavaaron kii ghoshnaa main puri tarah mahila sabha kii upeksha kii he
 Kushwaha had also sought a ticket from Ayodhya, but his work was sidelined and given to another candidate
 isi vajah se mahila sabha kii tejatarraar netaa ranjana vaajapeyi ne party chhod di thi
 Angry Ranjana joined the BSP for not getting tickets in the last Lok Sabha elections
 bhaajapa pehali party he jisane mahilaon ko sanghathan main 33 fisadi aarakshan diya
 She has divided the entire state into six enclaves - Gorakhpur, Kashi, Kanpur, Awadh, Brij and West - and has given her charge to the women officer of the state level
 jila tathaa mandal str par bhaajapa mahila morcha kii kaaryakarini he, lekin block or panchayat str par vah pradesh ke aadhe se zyada jilon main kamjor he
 Last June, this women's unit had staged a massive demonstration on the issue of atrocities on women and inflation in almost all districts including the capital Lucknow, but since then its activities have been quiet
 pradesh bhaajapa mahila morcha kii adhyaksh dow
 Madhu Mishra says, "currently Mahila Morcha activists are being engaged in preparation for the assembly elections
 har vidhansabha kshetra main 3,000 mahilaon kii ek team banegi jo basapa sarkaar main mahilaon par ho rahe atyaachaar ke prati ek maahaul taiyaar karegi
 "by the way, the party does not have the answer to the questions that when women workers are not getting at the block and panchayat level, then how 3,000 women workers will be mobilized in every assembly constituency?" Despite the activeness of the Mahila Morcha, it has not been able to get the required recognition in the general public
 chunaavon main bhi mahila morcha ke padaadhikariyon ko ahmiyat nahin di gai he
 There has been a steady increase in the number of women candidates in the last assembly elections, but the representation of leaders associated with the women's organization has been zero
 is baar bhi pradesh mahila morcha kii ore se chunaav ladgaye kii icchhuk 28 mahila padaadhikariyon kii suchi kendriya chunaav samiti ko bheji gai he lekin isamen se kisi ko tikat mili isaki sambhaavna na ke baraabar he
 a senior leader of the Morcha says that only senior leaders of the party do not want to advance women
 jin mahilaon ko tikat mil bhi rahaa he ve sabhi kisi bade netaa kii rishtedaar yaa phir unki kareebi rahi hai
 The dissatisfaction about not advancing the workers associated with the women's organization is no less in the Congress
 beeti 21 aktubar ko pradesh mahila congress cameti kii padaadhikariyon ne congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi se mulaakaat kar kam-se-kam 20 fisadi mahilaon ko chunaav main tikat dene kii maang rakhi thi
 But 20 women candidates have been included in the list of 134 declared candidates of the Congress so far
 inamen se ke val chaar hi party kii puraani kaaryakarta hai, baaki baahar se ai netaa hai
 State Congress Women's Committee chairperson Meera Singh says, "we have urged the party to field at least one seat in every district for the leaders of the women's organization
 '' mahila cameti se judi suraiya siddiki, anitha upaadhyaay, nutan vaajapeyi samet kai sakriy padaadhikari tikat ke liye daawa pesh kar chuki hai
 Dissatisfaction within the party may increase if the women's organization does not get the required participation in the election
 vaise, rashtriya anusuchit jati-janajati ayog ke adhyaksh pi

 puniya kii patni indira puniya, rajeev gandhi ke commando daste main shaamil rahe baharich se saansad camel kishor kii patni punam kishor, varisht netaa jagdambika paal kii patni snehalata paal ko chunaav ladaane kii charchaaen jor pakad rahi hai
 In the month of August, the women committee leaders had staged a massive protest in the state capital against the law and order in which many leaders were injured
 iske baad se mahila sanghathan kii gatividhiyaan kuch dhimi padi hai
 a woman leader says that as the election draws closer, the attention of women leaders will be diverted from women activists
 aisa isliye ki in netaaon ko chunaav main apni upasthiti dikhaani hoti he
 On the other hand, the post of president in the state women's unit of Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) has been vacant for the last three years
 2008 main rashtriya mahila lokdal kii pradesh adhyaksh shobhaa patel ne party par upeksha kaa aarope lagaakar istipha de diya tha
 No deployment has been made since then
 party main teen pradesh mahila mahasachiv hone ke baavjood mahila sanghathan kaa kaam sust he
 State RLD president Baba Hardev says that the women's organization is being formed afresh
 2008 main mahangaai ke virodh main pradeshvyapee gadaa phodo andolan ke baad se ralod kii mahila shakha ne pradesh main koi ullekhneey andolan nahin kiya he
 His candidature for the next assembly election is also going to be zero
 is baar bhi bhakpa se judi bhartiya mahila favderation kii beete chunaav kii tarah bhagidaari nahin hogi
 The women's organization has not been able to stand within the Peace Party, which came into existence four years ago
 haalanki party ne mahasachiv parveen ayub idrisi ko yah jimmedaari saunpi he
 Apna Dal state president Krishna Patel also says that in the next election, leaders associated with women's organizations will be given more space
 janavaadee party ne kareeb ek-chauthai siton par janavaadee mahila morcha kii padaadhikariyon ko utaarne kaa nirnay liya he
 It is clear that the parties raising the issues of women did not give due importance to the women's organizations within them
 mahila sanghathanon kii netaaon ko partiyon ne 'cosmetic faus' kii tarah upyog kiya he
 His work is limited to gathering only rallies and rallies
 samajashastri or lakhanu vishvavidhyalay kii purv kulapati pro

 ve kahati hai, ''mahila sanghathan partiyon main hi apni aawaaj nahin uthaa sakate, aise main rajnatik partiyon kii bajaae in mahila sanghathanon par hi tippanee kerani chahie
 As long as these organizations do not show militancy within the party, they will not pay any attention to their outside
 c mon @bcci this is worst u can do to anyone that too who is proven innocent not just once but again and again
 
 don't know why u doing this? The CBDT document identification number ie DIN number has been started
 Now CBDT will issue a notice to the taxpayers along with the DIN
 Often a notice is issued to the taxpayers by the Income Tax Department
 kai baar notice ke asli yaa farji hone kaa pataa lagaana mushkil hota he
 But now the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has introduced a special facility
 darasal, sibiditi kaa dastavej pahchaan sankhya yani DIN number shuru ho chukaa he
 After this, CBDT will now issue notice to the taxpayers along with DIN
 iskaa matlab yah he ki computer janarated DIN ke bina iskar vibhaag kii ore se notice, letters, aadesh yaa saman yaa anya kisi bhi tarah kaa communication amaanya mana jayega
 At the same time, it will also have no existence legally
 rajasav sachiv ajay bhushan pandeya ne isaki jaankaree dete hue bataaya ki sirf vishesh paristhitiyon ko chhodkar har tarah kaa communication diien kii sahaayta se hi hoga
 Pandey further said that if there is a need to have any kind of dialogue without it, then permission will have to be obtained in writing from the Chief Commissioner or Director General of Income Tax Department
 iske bina kisi bhi tarah ke communication ko avaidh qaraar diya jayega
 Explain that the DIN system has been prepared under the direction of Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman
 vahiin is system ko 1 oktober ko launch kiya gaya or pehle hi din 17,500 number janaret kiye gaye
 From today, any communication from Income Tax Dept without a computer generated DIN, be it a notice, letter, order & summon or any other correspondence, would be treated as invalid & shall be non est in law or deemed to be as if it has never been issued
 https: / / t
 co / avmfznusq4 — Nirmala Sitharaman (@nsitharaman) October 1, 2019 What do taxpayers have to do? It has been reported by CBDT that online communication between taxpayers and department will have to be uploaded on the IT department portal within 15 days 
 donon ke communication par diien number kaa istemaal hoga
 At the same time, it will record a record of every communication
 iske bina kisi bhi tarah kaa communication galat mana jayega

 The opposition in the Rajya Sabha was vocal on the National Medical Commission bill passed by the Lok Sabha
 guuruuvaar ko rajyasabha main vipakshi dalon ke saansadon ne is bill ko chikitsakon or chaatro ke khilaaf bataaya
 After the MBBS, the mps also opposed giving the exit exam to the students
 kaha ki aakhir chaatro ko kitni parikshaayen deni padengi
 The DMK, while citing incidents of suicide of students in Tamil Nadu, demanded abolition of the examination neet for medical admission
 rajyasabha main jaaniye vipakshi dalon ne bill ke praavdhaanon kii kaise aalochana kii
 1-how many exams will students have to give: Sanjay Raut While discussing the National Medical Commission bill in the Rajya Sabha, Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut said that the government is talking about ending corruption through it, but on the other hand there are chances of disturbances by giving uncontrolled force
 Has happened
 unhone kaha ki MBBS paas karne waalon ko practice ke liye agsit exam dena hoga, abhi neshnal agsit test sirf videshi chaatr dete hai
 Now how many exams will students have to give and who will give the degree remains a question
 rajyon ko pehle jo fees tay karne kaa adhikaar tha kya ab vah khatm ho gaya he
 Raut said that health is an important subject and complaints arising on it should be seriously considered
 2-rajyon kaa adhikaar chin rahi sarkaarrajyasabha main diemke saansad tiruchi shiva ne kaha ki sarkaar lagaataar rajyon ke adhikaar chin rahi he
 In every way the monopoly of the central government is going on unhone kaha ki kareeb 3 lakh doctor bhukh hadtaal par hai kyonki sarkaar ne unki shikaayatein nahin suni hai
 Shiva said that the representatives of the states would come on rotation basis, which we do not accept at all
 unhone kaha ki neet lagu hone ke baad garib or pichde bacchon ko daakhil milanaa mushkil ho gaya he or isaki vajah se tamilnadu main bachche khudakushi kar rahe hai
 Now the government is going to bring exit exam
 bill se neet or agsit exam ko hataanaa chahie
 3-'this is the National Medical Omission Bill 'in the Rajya Sabha, RJD MP Manoj Jha said that during the discussion on the bill, many doctors are on strike against the bill more than this and what will be the golden day
 unki chitaaon ke bare main sarkaar ko gambhirtha se vichaar karnaa chahie
 You talk of cooperative federalism by giving all the power in the hands of the Center
 unhone kaha ki agsit exam ko duniyabar main chunauti di ja rahi he or ham ab ise sabase behatar bataakar apane yahaan lagu kar rahe hai
 Actually we have become used to wearing landed
 aap medical ajukeshan ko corporate ke haathon main dene ja rahe hai
 It is not a National Commission bill but a National Medical Omission bill
 4-privet collejon ko chhot de rahi sarkaar shantnu sentiemasi saansad shantnu sen ne kaha ki sarkaron ke ishaaron par naachne waalon ko ayog kaa sadsy banaaya jayega jisase kendrikaran ko badhaava milegaa
 He said that right now, on the order of the Supreme Court, the admission fee of 85 percent seats in private colleges is fixed by the government, but in this bill, 50 percent seats are being left free but instead of fixing fees on the remaining 50 percent
 Rights are being taken away, it is clear that the government is selling entire seats of private colleges
 unhone sawaal karte hue kaha ki kya iske baad gaanv kaa koi pichhadaa baccha doctor ban paaegaa
 This will only make private medical colleges grow like mushrooms, the government is closing the doors of corruption in MCI and bringing a new flood of corruption in colleges
 tiemasi ne bill kaa virodh karte hue ise select cameti main bhejne kii maang kii he
 Sen said that this bill is different from the Medical Commission brought in the last Lok Sabha and there was no mention of clause 32 in it
 pichley bill main 59 jabaki is bill main 61 cloj hai
 Sen said that this is the biggest reform for the government to promote privatization of medical education
 saath hi is bill ko sansad main sabase badi neem-hakimi ke taur par janaa jayega

 Under the leadership of the 146 old newspaper Boston Globe, 300 newspapers have carried out editorial raids on the same day in their newspaper regarding freedom of the press
 aap boston globe kii site par jaakar press kii swatantraaa ko lekar likhe gaye 300 sampadakeey kaa adhyayan kar sakate hai
 All editorials are different

 You know that President Trump of America keeps attacking the press

 The American press has fought hard
 main neuyark times or boston globe ke sampadakeey kaa anuwaad kar rahaa hum taaki hindi ke yuva patrkaar or pathak amareeki press ke maanas main jhaank kar dekh saken
 The first is from the New York Times - 1787 main jab samvidhan kaa janm hua tha, us saal thomas jafarasan ne apane mitra ko likhaa tha ki agar mujh par iskaa faisalaa choda jaataa ki sarkaar ho magar akhbaar na ho, akhbaar ho lekin sarkaar na ho to main ek jatke main duusare vikalp ko chun letaa
 This was Jefferson's thinking before becoming president
 bees saal baad white house ke bheetar se press ko dekhne ke baad unke man main iske mahatv ko lekar bharosa kuch kam ho gaya tha
 "nothing can be believed in what is printed in the newspaper, the truth becomes doubtful by being put in this polluted vehicle
 " jaifarasan ke vichaar ab ye ho jate hai
 Jefferson's discomfort is understandable
 ek khule samaaj main news kii reporting kaa udhyam kai tarah ke hiton ke takaraav se jud jaataa he
 His uneasiness also reflects the need for the rights he added to the constitution
 apane anubhavon se samvidhan nirmaataaon ko laga tha ki sahi soochnaaon se las janata ko bhrashtachar mitaane or aage chalakar azaadi or nyaay ko protsaahit karne main madad milti he
 Public debate is a political duty
 1964 main supreme court ne kaha tha
 This debate should take place without any hesitation
 kai baar sarkaar or sarkari adhikariyon par jamkar hamale hone chahie, bhale hi wo kisi ko acha na lage
 In 2018, there have been attacks on the press on behalf of government officials
 kisi story ko kam dikhaane yaa zyaada dikhaane ko lekar news media kii aalochana thik he
 It is okay to criticize if something is printed wrong
 news reporter or sampadak bhi insaan hai
 They make mistakes
 unhen thik karnaa hamaare peshey kaa ahm hissaa he
 But to say the truth you don't like is fake news, it is dangerous for democracy
 patrakaron ko janata kaa dushman kahana bhi khataranaak he
 Small newspapers in America are going through an economic crisis
 desh bhar ke patrakaron kii raksha ke liye bane kanoon bhi kamazor hai
 In such a situation, these attacks on the press have become a challenge for him
 in sabake baad bhi in akhbaaron ke patrkaar sawaal poochne ke liye mehnat kiye ja rahe hai or aap tak un story ko pahunchaa rahe hai jinke bare main aapako pataa bhi nahin chalata
 The San Luis Obispo Tribune published a report about a prison inmate who was held in detention for 46 hours
 is report ne desh ko majaboor kar diya ki jail main maansik rup se biimaar kaidiyon ke ilaaj main badlaav laayaa jaae
 Last week, The Boston Globe proposed that their campaigns include small newspapers in towns to large metros
 The Times bhi isamen shaamil ho gaya taaki ham apane pathakon ko america ke azaad press ke mahatv ko yaad dilaa saken
 All these editors unite and underline the foundation of the American institution
 agar aapane in sampadakeey ko nahin padhaa he to pleez local akhabaaron ko sabsakrib karen, jab bhi ve acha kaam karen, unki tarif karen or agar lage ki isse bhi acha kar sakate hai to unki aalochana karen
 We are all together in this
 neuyork times kaa sampadakeey yahaan samaapt hota he
 Can big newspapers in India write such editorials in favor of small newspapers, do they include small newspapers in their campaign of press freedom? This New York Times editorial gives you a glimpse of how far behind we are in expressing democratic values
 isliye hindi ke patrkaar jinka jivan hindi ke akhabaaron main nishchit hi nasht hone vaala he, unhen ise padhanaa chahie
 Sometimes self-education saves itself from destruction
 akhbaar or patrakarita nasht ho jaaenge magar ek padhaa likhaa sachet patrkaar bachaa rahegaa
 If he survives, everything will be fine again
 ab aap america ke di bastal globe akhbaar kii site par jaaen
 Wrote about this campaign there
 is akhbaar ne un sabhi akhabaaron ke sampadakeey board se sampark saadhaa jo udaar mulyon or press kii azaadi main yakeen rakhte hai
 "the main focus of President Trump's politics is his constant attack on the free press
" patrakaron ko amareeki naagarik nahin mana jaataa he balki unhen logon ke dushman kii tarah pesh kiya ja rahaa he
 Continued attacks on the free press will have dangerous consequences
 isliye hamane desh bhar ke sabhi chote or bade udaaravaadi or rudhiwaadi akhbaaron ke sampadakeey board se sampark kiya ki ve in buniyadi hamalon ko lekar apane shabdon main sampadakeey likhen
 " jab desh main koi bhi bhrasht satta kaabiz hoti he tab uskaa kaam hota he ki azaad press kii jagah sarkaar sanchalit media ko le aae
 Today in America, we have a President who has prepared such a view that the part of the media that does not support the policies of the present administration is an enemy of the people
 raashtrapati dwaara failaae gaye kai jhooth main se ek jhooth yah bhi he
 “freedom of the press is mandatory for the protection of freedom
 " jon adam kaa yah sutara vaakya 200 saalon se zyaada amareeki siddhanton kaa hissaa rahaa he jisane patrakaron kii desh main raksha kii he
 Has been a model for the press in other countries of the world
 aaj is par gambhir khatara he
 From Beijing to Baghdad and Ankara to Moscow, dictators are constantly giving signals that journalists can be declared enemies of the public
 swatantrat samaaj ke liye press anivaary he kyonki yah netaaon par aankh band kar bharosa nahin karata he
 Whether he is a member of the Local Planning Board or the White House
 yah sirf sanyog nahin he ki maujuuda raashtrapati ke vittiya maamalon main kai jhol hai, jinke sandigdh vyaavhaaron ke chalate unheen ke justise department ne unki jaanch ke liye ek swatantra vakil kii niyukti kii he
 Now such a president has tried very hard to threaten those journalists who independently reveal many facts
 america main sabake bich ek sthapit or nishpaksh sahmati rahi he ki press kii bhoomika mahatvapurn he
 Even after this, there are many Americans who do not follow this opinion
 is maheene Ipsos ne ek survey kiya tha jisamen 48 fisadi republic samarthakon ne mana he ki news media amareeki janata kaa dushman he
 In another survey, 51 percent of Republicans compared the press to the enemy of the public
 loktantr kaa ahm hissaa nahin mana he
 Trump's attack explains why his supporters support this undemocratic attitude
 ek chauthai amareeki ab kehane lage hai ki raashtrapati ke paas karaab bartaav karne vaale press ko band karne kaa adhikaar hona chahie
 13 percent of the people in this survey have said that the President should discontinue news media such as CNN, The Washington Post and The New York Times
 apane samarthakon ko uksaane vaala yah model bataa rahaa he ki 21veen sadi ke taanashaah rus ke putin or turki ke erdogan kaise kaam karte hai
 You do not need to officially declare Centurieship to stop the information
 trump ke samarthak is baat par jor dete hai ki unka ishaara sirf us media kii taraf he jo tatasth nahin he
 They do not say this about the entire press
 lekin raashtrapati ke apane hi shabd or unka record baar-baar yahi bataata he ki samarthakon ke is tark main kitni beyimaani he
 The founders of America realized that the press could not be neutral, yet they ensured the freedom of the press and journalists in the constitution
 thomas jeffrasan ne likhaa tha ki hamaari swatantraaa press kii swatantraaa par nirbhar karti he or uski koi seemaa nahin tay kii ja sakati he
 From the founders of the constitution to the leaders of all parties, there have been complaints from the media
 media par aarope lagaate rahe hai lekin ek santhaan ke rup main press kaa hameshaa sammaan kiya gaya he
 It is not long before Republican President Ronald Regan said that our tradition of free press has been and will remain an integral and important part of our democracy
 1971 main supreme court ke justise hugo blike ne likhaa tha ki press kaa kaam shasit kii seva karnaa he na ki shaasha kaa
 Today Trump takes with him the same media that advocates his leadership
 sawaal nahin karata he
 If seen, only the President is not dividing the people for his political and personal benefits
 ve apane samarthakon se bhi kehete hai ki wo jo kah rahe hai usee kaa anukaran karen
 Last month in Kansas, he said that just listen to us, don't believe the rubbish these people (press) show
 itnaa yaad rakhana ki jo aap dekh rahe hai yaa pard rahe hai vahi sirf nahin ho rahaa he
 George Orwell stated in his novel 1984 that "the party who tells you not to listen to the evidence seen in your eyes and ears is the most mandatory and final decree from his side"
 " George Orwell put it more gracefully in his novel "1984
 ” “the party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears
 It was their final, most essential command
 ” Today, Trump asks his supporters to do the same
 apane kaarykaal ke pehle 558 dinon main unhone 4,229 galat daawey kiye hai
 The Washington Post lists his false claims
 phir bhi trump ke samarthakon main maatr 17 fisadi aise hai jo maanate hai ki amareeki prashasan lagaataar jhooth bolta rahata he
 His lie is becoming a fact
 soochnaaon se las nagarikon ke liye jhooth unke vajood ko nakaarta he
 The greatness of America depends on the fact that the free press is openly exposed to the truth
 press par janata kaa dushman kaa label chipkaana amareeki panrapara nahin he
 This decree is a threat to the common sense of citizenship that we have developed for two hundred years
 di boston globe kaa sampadakeey yahaan samaapt hota he
 The comments note- acha hota ki koi sabhi teen sau sampadakeey kaa anuwaad pesh karata kyonki har sampadakeey main alag anubhav or tathy hai
 This enhances our understanding of the freedom of the press
 hindi ke pathakon or patrakaron ke liye maine apni chuttee ke teen chaar ghante lagaakar yahaan anuwaad kiye hai
 It is also written so that you know that such work takes hard work
 vakt lagata he
 Everything does not come in focus

 i will translate some more editorials in the coming days

 pehla neuyark times kaa he- When the constitution was born in 1787, that year Thomas Jefferson wrote to his friend that if i was left with the decision that there should be a government but not a newspaper, but there is no government, then in a jolt i choose the other option Takes jaifarasan kii raashtrapati banane se pehle ye soch thi
 Twenty years later, after seeing the press from within the White House, he had lost some confidence in its importance
 "akhbaar main jo chhapata he us par kuch bhi vishwaas nahin kiya ja saktaa he, is pradooshit vaahan main daalane bhar se satya sandigdh ho jaataa he
 "now that's Jefferson's thoughts
" jaifarasan kii asahajata samajhi ja sakati he
 In an open society, the enterprise of reporting news is associated with a variety of conflicts of interest
 unki asahajata se un adhikaron kii zarurat bhi jhalkati he jise unhone samvidhan main joda tha
 The constitution makers had realized from their experiences that the people equipped with the right information helps to eradicate corruption and further promote freedom and justice
 saarvajanik bahes raajnneetik kartavya he
 The Supreme Court said in 1964
 yah bahes bina kisi jhijak ke khule man se honi chahie
 Many times the government and government officials should be attacked fiercely, even if they do not like anyone
 2018 main sarkari adhikariyon kii taraf se hi press ko lekar kshati pahunchane vaale hamale hue hai
 It is okay to criticize the news media for showing less or more of a story
 kuch galat chapa ho to uski aalochana thik he
 News reporters and editors are also human
 unase galatiyaan hoti hai
 Fixing them is an important part of our profession
 lekin aapako jo satya pasand nahin he use phek news kahana loktantr ke liye khataranaak he
 It is also dangerous to call journalists enemies of the public
 america main chote akhbaar aarthik sankat se guzar rahe hai
 Laws to protect journalists around the country are also weak
 aise main press par hone vaale ye hamale unke liye chunauti ban gaye hai
 Even after all this, journalists of these newspapers are working hard to ask questions and are sending you stories about which you do not even know
 The San Luis Obispo Tribune ne jail main band ek kaidi ke bare main report chhaapi thi jise 46 ghante tak roak kar rakhaa gaya tha
 This report forced the country to change the treatment of mentally ill prisoners in jail
 pichley hafte The Boston Globe kaa prastaav aayaa tha ki unke is abhiyaan main kasbon ke chote akhbaaron se lekar mahanagaron ke bade akhbaar shaamil ho rahe hai
 The Times also joined it so that we can remind our readers of the importance of the free press of America
 ye sabhi sampadakeey ekajute hokar amareeki santhaan ke buniyaad ko rekhaankit kar rahe hai
 If you have not read these editorials, please subscribe to the local newspapers, whenever they do good work, praise them and criticize them if you think you can do even better
 ham sab isamen saath hai
 The New York Times editorial ends here
 kya bharat ke bade akhbaar chote akhbaaron ke haq main aise sampadakeey likh sakate hai, kya ve press kii azaadi ke apane abhiyaan main chote akhbaaron ko shaamil karte hai? neuyark times ke is sampadakeey se aapako jhalak milti he ki ham loktantric mulyon ko abhivyakt karne main kitna peeche hai
 Therefore, Hindi journalists whose life is going to be destroyed in Hindi newspapers, they should read it
 kai baar swadhyay hi nasht hone se bachaa letaa he
 Newspaper and journalism will be destroyed, but a well-educated conscious journalist will remain
 wo batch jayega to phir kabhi sab thik bhi ho jayega
 Now go to the site of The Bastal Globe newspaper of USA
 vahaan is abhiyaan ke bare main likhaa he
 This newspaper contacted the editorial board of all those who believe in liberal values and freedom of the press
 "raashtrapati trump kii raajnneeti ke mukhya centre main he azaad press par lagaataar hamalaa karte rahanaa
 Journalists are not considered American citizens but are being projected as enemies of the people
 azaad press par hone vaale nirantar hamalon ke khataranaak parinaam honge
 So we approached the editorial board of all the small and big liberal and conservative newspapers across the country to write editorials in their own words about these basic attacks
 " When there is any corrupt power in the country, its job is to replace the free press with government-run media
 aaj america main hamaare paas ek aise raashtrapati hai jinhone aisi soch taiyaar kar di he ki media kaa jo hissaa maujuuda prashasan kii nitiyon ko saport nahin karata he, vah janata kaa dushman he
 It is also one of the many lies spread by the President
 "swatantraaa kii suraksha ke liye press kii swatantraaa anivaary he
 "this formula of John Adam has been part of American principles for over 200 years that have protected journalists in the country
 duniya ke anya deshon main press ke liye model kaa kaam karata rahaa he
 Today it is in serious danger
 beijing se baghdad or ankara se lekar moscow tak ke taanaashaahon kii taraf se ye signal lagaataar diya ja rahaa he ki patrakaron ko janata kaa dushman ghoshit kiya ja saktaa he
 The press is indispensable for an independent society because it does not trust politicians blindly
 chaahe wo sthaneey yojana board ke sadsy hon yaa phir white house ke
 It is not a mere coincidence that the current president has a lot of strings attached in financial matters, due to which he has been appointed by his own Justice Department as an independent counsel to investigate him
 ab aise raashtrapati ne un patrakaron ko dhamkaane kii bahut koshish kii he jo swatantra rup se kai tathyon ko saamne laate hai
 There has been an established and unbiased consensus among all in America that the role of the press is important
 iske baad bhi ab aise bahut se american hai jo is mat ko nahin maanate hai
 This month, Ipsos conducted a survey in which 48 percent of Republicans believed that the news media was an enemy of the American public
 ek or survey main 51 fisadi republican ne press kii tulana janata ke dushman se kii he
 Is not considered an important part of democracy
 trump ke hamale se pataa chalata he ki kyon unke samarthak is aloktantric ravaiye kaa samarthan karte hai
 a quarter of Americans are now saying that the president should have the authority to shut down the ill-treated press
 is survey main shaamil 13 fisadi logon ne kaha he ki raashtrapati ko CNN, The Washington Post and The New York Times jaise samachar madhyamon ko band kar dena chahie
 This model, provoking its supporters, is describing how 21st-century dictators, Russia's Putin and Turkey's Erdogan, work
 aapako soochnaaon ko rokane ke liye aadhikarik rup se sensharship ke elaan kii zarurat hi nahin he
 Trump's supporters insist that his reference is only to media that is not neutral
 ve saare press ke bare main aisa nahin kehete hai
 But the President's own words and his record repeatedly show how dishonest this argument of supporters is
 america ke sansthaapakon ne is baat ko mahasoos kiya tha ki press tatasth nahin bhi ho saktaa he phir bhi unhone samvidhan main press or patrakaron kii swatantraaa ko sunishchit kiya tha
 Thomas Jefferson wrote that our freedom depends on the freedom of the press and there can be no limit
 samvidhan ke sansthaapakon se lekar sabhi dalon ke netaaon ko media se shikaayatein rahi hai
 The media has been accused but the press has always been respected as an institution
 bahut lambey samay kii baat nahin he jab republican raashtrapati ronald regan ne kaha tha ki mukt press kii hamaari parampara hamaare loktantr kaa abhinn or mahatvapurn ang rahaa he or rahegaa
 In 1971, Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black wrote that the job of the press is to serve the governed and not the ruler
 aaj trump apane saath usee media ko lekar le jate hai jo unke netritv kii vakaalat karata he
 Does not question
 dekha jaae to sirf raashtrapati hi apane raajnneetik or nijee phaayde ke liye logon main vibhaajan nahin kar rahe hai
 They also ask their supporters to follow what they are saying
 pichley maheene consaas main unhone kaha tha ki bas hamaari suno, ye log (press) jo bakawaas dikhaate hai us par yakeen mat karo
 So remember that what you are watching or studying is not just happening
 jorge orwell ne apane upanyaas 1984 main kaha tha ki "jo party aapako yah kahe ki apni ankhon or kaanon ke dekhe-sune sabooton ko mat maano, yah unki taraf se sabase anivaary or antim farmaan he
 " George Orwell put it more gracefully in his novel “1984
 "" The party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears
 It was their final, most essential command
 " aaj trump apane samarthakon ko yahi karne ke liye kehete hai
 In the first 558 days of his tenure, he has made 4,229 false claims
 washington post ne unke jhuthe daavon kii suchi banaai he
 Yet there are only 17 percent of Trump's supporters who believe that the US administration continues to lie
 unka jhooth hi tathy banataa ja rahaa he
 For citizens equipped with information, lies deny their existence
 america kii mahanata is par nirbhar he ki mukt press satta ke saamne khulkar satya kaa bayaan kare
 It is not American tradition to stick the public's enemy label on the press
 do sau saalon se jis naagarikta kii saajha samaj hamane viksit kii he, uske liye yah farmaan khatara he
 The Boston Globe editorial ends here
 tippaniyan Note- It would have been nice to have someone present a translation of all three hundred editorials because every editorial has different experiences and facts
 isse press kii azaadi ko lekar hamaari samaj or vistrut hoti he
 i have translated here for Hindi readers and journalists after spending three to four hours of my vacation

 The founders of America realized that the press could not be neutral, yet they ensured the freedom of the press and journalists in the constitution

 From the founders of the constitution to the leaders of all parties, there have been complaints from the media

 It is not long before Republican President Ronald Regan said that our tradition of free press has been and will remain an integral and important part of our democracy
 1971 main supreme court ke justise hugo blike ne likhaa tha ki press kaa kaam shasit kii seva karnaa he na ki shaasha kaa
 Today Trump takes with him the same media that advocates his leadership
 sawaal nahin karata he
 If seen, only the President is not dividing the people for his political and personal benefits
 ve apane samarthakon se bhi kehete hai ki wo jo kah rahe hai usee kaa anukaran karen
 Last month in Kansas, he said that just listen to us, don't believe the rubbish these people (press) show

 The constitution makers had realized from their experiences that the people equipped with the right information helps to eradicate corruption and further promote freedom and justice
 saarvajanik bahes raajnneetik kartavya he
 The Supreme Court said in 1964
 yah bahes bina kisi jhijak ke khule man se honi chahie
 Many times the government and government officials should be attacked fiercely, even if they do not like anyone
 2018 main sarkari adhikariyon kii taraf se hi press ko lekar kshati pahunchane vaale hamale hue hai
 It is okay to criticize the news media for showing less or more of a story
 kuch galat chapa ho to uski aalochana thik he
 News reporters and editors are also human
 unase galatiyaan hoti hai
 Fixing them is an important part of our profession
 lekin aapako jo satya pasand nahin he use phek news kahana loktantr ke liye khataranaak he
 It is also dangerous to call journalists enemies of the public
 america main chote akhbaar aarthik sankat se guzar rahe hai
 Laws to protect journalists around the country are also weak
 aise main press par hone vaale ye hamale unke liye chunauti ban gaye hai
 Even after all this, journalists of these newspapers are working hard to ask questions and are sending you stories about which you do not even know
 The San Luis Obispo Tribune ne jail main band ek kaidi ke bare main report chhaapi thi jise 46 ghante tak roak kar rakhaa gaya tha
 This report forced the country to change the treatment of mentally ill prisoners in jail
 pichley hafte The Boston Globe kaa prastaav aayaa tha ki unke is abhiyaan main kasbon ke chote akhbaaron se lekar mahanagaron ke bade akhbaar shaamil ho rahe hai
 The Times also joined it so that we can remind our readers of the importance of the free press of America

 If you have not read these editorials, please subscribe to the local newspapers, whenever they do good work, praise them and criticize them if you think you can do even better
 ham sab isamen saath hai
 The New York Times editorial ends here
 kya bharat ke bade akhbaar chote akhbaaron ke haq main aise sampadakeey likh sakate hai, kya ve press kii azaadi ke apane abhiyaan main chote akhbaaron ko shaamil karte hai? neuyark times ke is sampadakeey se aapako jhalak milti he ki ham loktantric mulyon ko abhivyakt karne main kitna peeche hai
 Therefore, Hindi journalists whose life is going to be destroyed in Hindi newspapers, they should read it
 kai baar swadhyay hi nasht hone se bachaa letaa he
 Newspaper and journalism will be destroyed, but a well-educated conscious journalist will remain
 wo batch jayega to phir kabhi sab thik bhi ho jayega
 Now go to the site of The Bastal Globe newspaper of USA
 vahaan is abhiyaan ke bare main likhaa he
 This newspaper contacted the editorial board of all those who believe in liberal values and freedom of the press
 "raashtrapati trump kii raajnneeti ke mukhya centre main he azaad press par lagaataar hamalaa karte rahanaa
 Journalists are not considered American citizens but are being projected as enemies of the people
 azaad press par hone vaale nirantar hamalon ke khataranaak parinaam honge
 So we approached the editorial board of all the small and big liberal and conservative newspapers across the country to write editorials in their own words about these basic attacks
 " When there is any corrupt power in the country, its job is to replace the free press with government-run media
 aaj america main hamaare paas ek aise raashtrapati hai jinhone aisi soch taiyaar kar di he ki media kaa jo hissaa maujuuda prashasan kii nitiyon ko saport nahin karata he, vah janata kaa dushman he
 It is also one of the many lies spread by the President
 "swatantraaa kii suraksha ke liye press kii swatantraaa anivaary he
 "this formula of John Adam has been part of American principles for over 200 years that have protected journalists in the country
 duniya ke anya deshon main press ke liye model kaa kaam karata rahaa he
 Today it is in serious danger
 beijing se baghdad or ankara se lekar moscow tak ke taanaashaahon kii taraf se ye signal lagaataar diya ja rahaa he ki patrakaron ko janata kaa dushman ghoshit kiya ja saktaa he
 The press is indispensable for an independent society because it does not trust politicians blindly
 chaahe wo sthaneey yojana board ke sadsy hon yaa phir white house ke
 It is not a mere coincidence that the current president has a lot of strings attached in financial matters, due to which he has been appointed by his own Justice Department as an independent counsel to investigate him
 ab aise raashtrapati ne un patrakaron ko dhamkaane kii bahut koshish kii he jo swatantra rup se kai tathyon ko saamne laate hai
 There has been an established and unbiased consensus among all in America that the role of the press is important
 iske baad bhi ab aise bahut se american hai jo is mat ko nahin maanate hai
 This month, Ipsos conducted a survey in which 48 percent of Republicans believed that the news media was an enemy of the American public
 ek or survey main 51 fisadi republican ne press kii tulana janata ke dushman se kii he
 Is not considered an important part of democracy
 trump ke hamale se pataa chalata he ki kyon unke samarthak is aloktantric ravaiye kaa samarthan karte hai
 a quarter of Americans are now saying that the president should have the authority to shut down the ill-treated press
 is survey main shaamil 13 fisadi logon ne kaha he ki raashtrapati ko CNN, The Washington Post and The New York Times jaise samachar madhyamon ko band kar dena chahie
 This model, provoking its supporters, is describing how 21st-century dictators, Russia's Putin and Turkey's Erdogan, work
 aapako soochnaaon ko rokane ke liye aadhikarik rup se sensharship ke elaan kii zarurat hi nahin he
 Trump's supporters insist that his reference is only to media that is not neutral
 ve saare press ke bare main aisa nahin kehete hai
 But the President's own words and his record repeatedly show how dishonest this argument of supporters is
 america ke sansthaapakon ne is baat ko mahasoos kiya tha ki press tatasth nahin bhi ho saktaa he phir bhi unhone samvidhan main press or patrakaron kii swatantraaa ko sunishchit kiya tha
 Thomas Jefferson wrote that our freedom depends on the freedom of the press and there can be no limit
 samvidhan ke sansthaapakon se lekar sabhi dalon ke netaaon ko media se shikaayatein rahi hai
 The media has been accused but the press has always been respected as an institution
 bahut lambey samay kii baat nahin he jab republican raashtrapati ronald regan ne kaha tha ki mukt press kii hamaari parampara hamaare loktantr kaa abhinn or mahatvapurn ang rahaa he or rahegaa
 In 1971, Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black wrote that the job of the press is to serve the governed and not the ruler
 aaj trump apane saath usee media ko lekar le jate hai jo unke netritv kii vakaalat karata he
 Does not question
 dekha jaae to sirf raashtrapati hi apane raajnneetik or nijee phaayde ke liye logon main vibhaajan nahin kar rahe hai
 They also ask their supporters to follow what they are saying
 pichley maheene consaas main unhone kaha tha ki bas hamaari suno, ye log (press) jo bakawaas dikhaate hai us par yakeen mat karo
 So remember that what you are watching or studying is not just happening
 jorge orwell ne apane upanyaas 1984 main kaha tha ki "jo party aapako yah kahe ki apni ankhon or kaanon ke dekhe-sune sabooton ko mat maano, yah unki taraf se sabase anivaary or antim farmaan he
 " George Orwell put it more gracefully in his novel “1984
 "" The party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears
 It was their final, most essential command
 " aaj trump apane samarthakon ko yahi karne ke liye kehete hai
 In the first 558 days of his tenure, he has made 4,229 false claims
 washington post ne unke jhuthe daavon kii suchi banaai he
 Yet there are only 17 percent of Trump's supporters who believe that the US administration continues to lie
 unka jhooth hi tathy banataa ja rahaa he
 For citizens equipped with information, lies deny their existence
 america kii mahanata is par nirbhar he ki mukt press satta ke saamne khulkar satya kaa bayaan kare
 It is not American tradition to stick the public's enemy label on the press
 do sau saalon se jis naagarikta kii saajha samaj hamane viksit kii he, uske liye yah farmaan khatara he
 The Boston Globe editorial ends here
 tippaniyan Note- It would have been nice to have someone present a translation of all three hundred editorials because every editorial has different experiences and facts
 isse press kii azaadi ko lekar hamaari samaj or vistrut hoti he
 i have translated here for Hindi readers and journalists after spending three to four hours of my vacation
 yah isliye bhi likhaa he taaki aapako pataa rahe ki is tarah ke kaam main mehnat lagati he
 Takes time sab kuch fokat main nahin aata he

 Public debate is a political duty
 1964 main supreme court ne kaha tha
 This debate should take place without any hesitation
 kai baar sarkaar or sarkari adhikariyon par jamkar hamale hone chahie, bhale hi wo kisi ko acha na lage
 In 2018, there have been attacks on the press on behalf of government officials
 kisi story ko kam dikhaane yaa zyaada dikhaane ko lekar news media kii aalochana thik he
 It is okay to criticize if something is printed wrong
 news reporter or sampadak bhi insaan hai
 They make mistakes
 unhen thik karnaa hamaare peshey kaa ahm hissaa he
 But to say the truth you don't like is fake news, it is dangerous for democracy
 patrakaron ko janata kaa dushman kahana bhi khataranaak he
 Small newspapers in America are going through an economic crisis
 desh bhar ke patrakaron kii raksha ke liye bane kanoon bhi kamazor hai
 In such a situation, these attacks on the press have become a challenge for him
 in sabake baad bhi in akhbaaron ke patrkaar sawaal poochne ke liye mehnat kiye ja rahe hai or aap tak un story ko pahunchaa rahe hai jinke bare main aapako pataa bhi nahin chalata
 The San Luis Obispo Tribune published a report about a prison inmate who was held in detention for 46 hours
 is report ne desh ko majaboor kar diya ki jail main maansik rup se biimaar kaidiyon ke ilaaj main badlaav laayaa jaae
 Last week, The Boston Globe proposed that their campaigns include small newspapers in towns to large metros
 The Times bhi isamen shaamil ho gaya taaki ham apane pathakon ko america ke azaad press ke mahatv ko yaad dilaa saken
 All these editors unite and underline the foundation of the American institution
 agar aapane in sampadakeey ko nahin padhaa he to pleez local akhabaaron ko sabsakrib karen, jab bhi ve acha kaam karen, unki tarif karen or agar lage ki isse bhi acha kar sakate hai to unki aalochana karen
 We are all together in this
 neuyork times kaa sampadakeey yahaan samaapt hota he
 Can big newspapers in India write such editorials in favor of small newspapers, do they include small newspapers in their campaign of press freedom? This New York Times editorial gives you a glimpse of how far behind we are in expressing democratic values
 isliye hindi ke patrkaar jinka jivan hindi ke akhabaaron main nishchit hi nasht hone vaala he, unhen ise padhanaa chahie
 Sometimes self-education saves itself from destruction
 akhbaar or patrakarita nasht ho jaaenge magar ek padhaa likhaa sachet patrkaar bachaa rahegaa
 If he survives, everything will be fine again
 ab aap america ke di bastal globe akhbaar kii site par jaaen
 Wrote about this campaign there
 is akhbaar ne un sabhi akhabaaron ke sampadakeey board se sampark saadhaa jo udaar mulyon or press kii azaadi main yakeen rakhte hai
 "the main focus of President Trump's politics is his constant attack on the free press
" patrakaron ko amareeki naagarik nahin mana jaataa he balki unhen logon ke dushman kii tarah pesh kiya ja rahaa he
 Continued attacks on the free press will have dangerous consequences
 isliye hamane desh bhar ke sabhi chote or bade udaaravaadi or rudhiwaadi akhbaaron ke sampadakeey board se sampark kiya ki ve in buniyadi hamalon ko lekar apane shabdon main sampadakeey likhen
 " jab desh main koi bhi bhrasht satta kaabiz hoti he tab uskaa kaam hota he ki azaad press kii jagah sarkaar sanchalit media ko le aae
 Today in America, we have a President who has prepared such a view that the part of the media that does not support the policies of the present administration is an enemy of the people
 raashtrapati dwaara failaae gaye kai jhooth main se ek jhooth yah bhi he
 “freedom of the press is mandatory for the protection of freedom
 " jon adam kaa yah sutara vaakya 200 saalon se zyaada amareeki siddhanton kaa hissaa rahaa he jisane patrakaron kii desh main raksha kii he
 Has been a model for the press in other countries of the world
 aaj is par gambhir khatara he
 From Beijing to Baghdad and Ankara to Moscow, dictators are constantly giving signals that journalists can be declared enemies of the public
 swatantrat samaaj ke liye press anivaary he kyonki yah netaaon par aankh band kar bharosa nahin karata he
 Whether he is a member of the Local Planning Board or the White House
 yah sirf sanyog nahin he ki maujuuda raashtrapati ke vittiya maamalon main kai jhol hai, jinke sandigdh vyaavhaaron ke chalate unheen ke justise department ne unki jaanch ke liye ek swatantra vakil kii niyukti kii he
 Now such a president has tried very hard to threaten those journalists who independently reveal many facts
 america main sabake bich ek sthapit or nishpaksh sahmati rahi he ki press kii bhoomika mahatvapurn he
 Even after this, there are many Americans who do not follow this opinion
 is maheene Ipsos ne ek survey kiya tha jisamen 48 fisadi republic samarthakon ne mana he ki news media amareeki janata kaa dushman he
 In another survey, 51 percent of Republicans compared the press to the enemy of the public
 loktantr kaa ahm hissaa nahin mana he
 Trump's attack explains why his supporters support this undemocratic attitude
 ek chauthai amareeki ab kehane lage hai ki raashtrapati ke paas karaab bartaav karne vaale press ko band karne kaa adhikaar hona chahie
 13 percent of the people in this survey have said that the President should discontinue news media such as CNN, The Washington Post and The New York Times
 apane samarthakon ko uksaane vaala yah model bataa rahaa he ki 21veen sadi ke taanashaah rus ke putin or turki ke erdogan kaise kaam karte hai
 You do not need to officially declare Centurieship to stop the information
 trump ke samarthak is baat par jor dete hai ki unka ishaara sirf us media kii taraf he jo tatasth nahin he
 They do not say this about the entire press
 lekin raashtrapati ke apane hi shabd or unka record baar-baar yahi bataata he ki samarthakon ke is tark main kitni beyimaani he
 The founders of America realized that the press could not be neutral, yet they ensured the freedom of the press and journalists in the constitution

 Small newspapers in America are going through an economic crisis

 In such a situation, these attacks on the press have become a challenge for him

 ye sabhi sampadakeey ekajute hokar amareeki santhaan ke buniyaad ko rekhaankit kar rahe hai
 If you have not read these editorials, please subscribe to the local newspapers, whenever they do good work, praise them and criticize them if you think you can do even better
 ham sab isamen saath hai
 The New York Times editorial ends here
 kya bharat ke bade akhbaar chote akhbaaron ke haq main aise sampadakeey likh sakate hai, kya ve press kii azaadi ke apane abhiyaan main chote akhbaaron ko shaamil karte hai? neuyark times ke is sampadakeey se aapako jhalak milti he ki ham loktantric mulyon ko abhivyakt karne main kitna peeche hai
 Therefore, Hindi journalists whose life is going to be destroyed in Hindi newspapers, they should read it
 kai baar swadhyay hi nasht hone se bachaa letaa he
 Newspaper and journalism will be destroyed, but a well-educated conscious journalist will remain
 wo batch jayega to phir kabhi sab thik bhi ho jayega
 Now go to the site of The Bastal Globe newspaper of USA
 vahaan is abhiyaan ke bare main likhaa he
 This newspaper contacted the editorial board of all those who believe in liberal values and freedom of the press
 "raashtrapati trump kii raajnneeti ke mukhya centre main he azaad press par lagaataar hamalaa karte rahanaa
 Journalists are not considered American citizens but are being projected as enemies of the people
 azaad press par hone vaale nirantar hamalon ke khataranaak parinaam honge
 So we approached the editorial board of all the small and big liberal and conservative newspapers across the country to write editorials in their own words about these basic attacks
 " When there is any corrupt power in the country, its job is to replace the free press with government-run media
 aaj america main hamaare paas ek aise raashtrapati hai jinhone aisi soch taiyaar kar di he ki media kaa jo hissaa maujuuda prashasan kii nitiyon ko saport nahin karata he, vah janata kaa dushman he
 It is also one of the many lies spread by the President
 "swatantraaa kii suraksha ke liye press kii swatantraaa anivaary he
 "this formula of John Adam has been part of American principles for over 200 years that have protected journalists in the country
 duniya ke anya deshon main press ke liye model kaa kaam karata rahaa he
 Today it is in serious danger
 beijing se baghdad or ankara se lekar moscow tak ke taanaashaahon kii taraf se ye signal lagaataar diya ja rahaa he ki patrakaron ko janata kaa dushman ghoshit kiya ja saktaa he
 The press is indispensable for an independent society because it does not trust politicians blindly
 chaahe wo sthaneey yojana board ke sadsy hon yaa phir white house ke
 It is not a mere coincidence that the current president has a lot of strings attached in financial matters, due to which he has been appointed by his own Justice Department as an independent counsel to investigate him
 ab aise raashtrapati ne un patrakaron ko dhamkaane kii bahut koshish kii he jo swatantra rup se kai tathyon ko saamne laate hai
 There has been an established and unbiased consensus among all in America that the role of the press is important
 iske baad bhi ab aise bahut se american hai jo is mat ko nahin maanate hai
 This month, Ipsos conducted a survey in which 48 percent of Republicans believed that the news media was an enemy of the American public
 ek or survey main 51 fisadi republican ne press kii tulana janata ke dushman se kii he
 Is not considered an important part of democracy
 trump ke hamale se pataa chalata he ki kyon unke samarthak is aloktantric ravaiye kaa samarthan karte hai
 a quarter of Americans are now saying that the president should have the authority to shut down the ill-treated press
 is survey main shaamil 13 fisadi logon ne kaha he ki raashtrapati ko CNN, The Washington Post and The New York Times jaise samachar madhyamon ko band kar dena chahie
 This model, provoking its supporters, is describing how 21st-century dictators, Russia's Putin and Turkey's Erdogan, work
 aapako soochnaaon ko rokane ke liye aadhikarik rup se sensharship ke elaan kii zarurat hi nahin he
 Trump's supporters insist that his reference is only to media that is not neutral
 ve saare press ke bare main aisa nahin kehete hai
 But the President's own words and his record repeatedly show how dishonest this argument of supporters is
 america ke sansthaapakon ne is baat ko mahasoos kiya tha ki press tatasth nahin bhi ho saktaa he phir bhi unhone samvidhan main press or patrakaron kii swatantraaa ko sunishchit kiya tha
 Thomas Jefferson wrote that our freedom depends on the freedom of the press and there can be no limit
 samvidhan ke sansthaapakon se lekar sabhi dalon ke netaaon ko media se shikaayatein rahi hai
 The media has been accused but the press has always been respected as an institution
 bahut lambey samay kii baat nahin he jab republican raashtrapati ronald regan ne kaha tha ki mukt press kii hamaari parampara hamaare loktantr kaa abhinn or mahatvapurn ang rahaa he or rahegaa
 In 1971, Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black wrote that the job of the press is to serve the governed and not the ruler
 aaj trump apane saath usee media ko lekar le jate hai jo unke netritv kii vakaalat karata he
 Does not question
 dekha jaae to sirf raashtrapati hi apane raajnneetik or nijee phaayde ke liye logon main vibhaajan nahin kar rahe hai
 They also ask their supporters to follow what they are saying
 pichley maheene consaas main unhone kaha tha ki bas hamaari suno, ye log (press) jo bakawaas dikhaate hai us par yakeen mat karo
 So remember that what you are watching or studying is not just happening
 jorge orwell ne apane upanyaas 1984 main kaha tha ki "jo party aapako yah kahe ki apni ankhon or kaanon ke dekhe-sune sabooton ko mat maano, yah unki taraf se sabase anivaary or antim farmaan he
 " George Orwell put it more gracefully in his novel “1984
 "" The party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears
 It was their final, most essential command
 " aaj trump apane samarthakon ko yahi karne ke liye kehete hai
 In the first 558 days of his tenure, he has made 4,229 false claims
 washington post ne unke jhuthe daavon kii suchi banaai he

 neuyork times kaa sampadakeey yahaan samaapt hota he
 Can big newspapers in India write such editorials in favor of small newspapers, do they include small newspapers in their campaign of press freedom? This New York Times editorial gives you a glimpse of how far behind we are in expressing democratic values
 isliye hindi ke patrkaar jinka jivan hindi ke akhabaaron main nishchit hi nasht hone vaala he, unhen ise padhanaa chahie
 Sometimes self-education saves itself from destruction
 akhbaar or patrakarita nasht ho jaaenge magar ek padhaa likhaa sachet patrkaar bachaa rahegaa
 If he survives, everything will be fine again
 ab aap america ke di bastal globe akhbaar kii site par jaaen

 "the main focus of President Trump's politics is his constant attack on the free press
" patrakaron ko amareeki naagarik nahin mana jaataa he balki unhen logon ke dushman kii tarah pesh kiya ja rahaa he
 Continued attacks on the free press will have dangerous consequences

 kya bharat ke bade akhbaar chote akhbaaron ke haq main aise sampadakeey likh sakate hai, kya ve press kii azaadi ke apane abhiyaan main chote akhbaaron ko shaamil karte hai? neuyark times ke is sampadakeey se aapako jhalak milti he ki ham loktantric mulyon ko abhivyakt karne main kitna peeche hai
 Therefore, Hindi journalists whose life is going to be destroyed in Hindi newspapers, they should read it
 kai baar swadhyay hi nasht hone se bachaa letaa he
 Newspaper and journalism will be destroyed, but a well-educated conscious journalist will remain
 wo batch jayega to phir kabhi sab thik bhi ho jayega
 Now go to the site of The Bastal Globe newspaper of USA
 vahaan is abhiyaan ke bare main likhaa he
 This newspaper contacted the editorial board of all those who believe in liberal values and freedom of the press
 "raashtrapati trump kii raajnneeti ke mukhya centre main he azaad press par lagaataar hamalaa karte rahanaa
 Journalists are not considered American citizens but are being projected as enemies of the people
 azaad press par hone vaale nirantar hamalon ke khataranaak parinaam honge
 So we approached the editorial board of all the small and big liberal and conservative newspapers across the country to write editorials in their own words about these basic attacks
 " When there is any corrupt power in the country, its job is to replace the free press with government-run media
 aaj america main hamaare paas ek aise raashtrapati hai jinhone aisi soch taiyaar kar di he ki media kaa jo hissaa maujuuda prashasan kii nitiyon ko saport nahin karata he, vah janata kaa dushman he
 It is also one of the many lies spread by the President
 "swatantraaa kii suraksha ke liye press kii swatantraaa anivaary he
 "this formula of John Adam has been part of American principles for over 200 years that have protected journalists in the country
 duniya ke anya deshon main press ke liye model kaa kaam karata rahaa he
 Today it is in serious danger
 beijing se baghdad or ankara se lekar moscow tak ke taanaashaahon kii taraf se ye signal lagaataar diya ja rahaa he ki patrakaron ko janata kaa dushman ghoshit kiya ja saktaa he
 The press is indispensable for an independent society because it does not trust politicians blindly
 chaahe wo sthaneey yojana board ke sadsy hon yaa phir white house ke
 It is not a mere coincidence that the current president has a lot of strings attached in financial matters, due to which he has been appointed by his own Justice Department as an independent counsel to investigate him
 ab aise raashtrapati ne un patrakaron ko dhamkaane kii bahut koshish kii he jo swatantra rup se kai tathyon ko saamne laate hai
 There has been an established and unbiased consensus among all in America that the role of the press is important
 iske baad bhi ab aise bahut se american hai jo is mat ko nahin maanate hai
 This month, Ipsos conducted a survey in which 48 percent of Republicans believed that the news media was an enemy of the American public
 ek or survey main 51 fisadi republican ne press kii tulana janata ke dushman se kii he
 Is not considered an important part of democracy
 trump ke hamale se pataa chalata he ki kyon unke samarthak is aloktantric ravaiye kaa samarthan karte hai
 a quarter of Americans are now saying that the president should have the authority to shut down the ill-treated press
 is survey main shaamil 13 fisadi logon ne kaha he ki raashtrapati ko CNN, The Washington Post and The New York Times jaise samachar madhyamon ko band kar dena chahie
 This model, provoking its supporters, is describing how 21st-century dictators, Russia's Putin and Turkey's Erdogan, work
 aapako soochnaaon ko rokane ke liye aadhikarik rup se sensharship ke elaan kii zarurat hi nahin he
 Trump's supporters insist that his reference is only to media that is not neutral
 ve saare press ke bare main aisa nahin kehete hai
 But the President's own words and his record repeatedly show how dishonest this argument of supporters is
 america ke sansthaapakon ne is baat ko mahasoos kiya tha ki press tatasth nahin bhi ho saktaa he phir bhi unhone samvidhan main press or patrakaron kii swatantraaa ko sunishchit kiya tha
 Thomas Jefferson wrote that our freedom depends on the freedom of the press and there can be no limit
 samvidhan ke sansthaapakon se lekar sabhi dalon ke netaaon ko media se shikaayatein rahi hai
 The media has been accused but the press has always been respected as an institution
 bahut lambey samay kii baat nahin he jab republican raashtrapati ronald regan ne kaha tha ki mukt press kii hamaari parampara hamaare loktantr kaa abhinn or mahatvapurn ang rahaa he or rahegaa
 In 1971, Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black wrote that the job of the press is to serve the governed and not the ruler
 aaj trump apane saath usee media ko lekar le jate hai jo unke netritv kii vakaalat karata he
 Does not question
 dekha jaae to sirf raashtrapati hi apane raajnneetik or nijee phaayde ke liye logon main vibhaajan nahin kar rahe hai
 They also ask their supporters to follow what they are saying
 pichley maheene consaas main unhone kaha tha ki bas hamaari suno, ye log (press) jo bakawaas dikhaate hai us par yakeen mat karo
 So remember that what you are watching or studying is not just happening
 jorge orwell ne apane upanyaas 1984 main kaha tha ki "jo party aapako yah kahe ki apni ankhon or kaanon ke dekhe-sune sabooton ko mat maano, yah unki taraf se sabase anivaary or antim farmaan he
 " George Orwell put it more gracefully in his novel “1984
 "" The party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears
 It was their final, most essential command
 " aaj trump apane samarthakon ko yahi karne ke liye kehete hai
 In the first 558 days of his tenure, he has made 4,229 false claims
 washington post ne unke jhuthe daavon kii suchi banaai he
 Yet there are only 17 percent of Trump's supporters who believe that the US administration continues to lie
 unka jhooth hi tathy banataa ja rahaa he
 For citizens equipped with information, lies deny their existence
 america kii mahanata is par nirbhar he ki mukt press satta ke saamne khulkar satya kaa bayaan kare
 It is not American tradition to stick the public's enemy label on the press
 do sau saalon se jis naagarikta kii saajha samaj hamane viksit kii he, uske liye yah farmaan khatara he
 The Boston Globe editorial ends here
 tippaniyan Note- It would have been nice to have someone present a translation of all three hundred editorials because every editorial has different experiences and facts
 isse press kii azaadi ko lekar hamaari samaj or vistrut hoti he
 i have translated here for Hindi readers and journalists after spending three to four hours of my vacation
 yah isliye bhi likhaa he taaki aapako pataa rahe ki is tarah ke kaam main mehnat lagati he

 america ke sansthaapakon ne is baat ko mahasoos kiya tha ki press tatasth nahin bhi ho saktaa he phir bhi unhone samvidhan main press or patrakaron kii swatantraaa ko sunishchit kiya tha
 Thomas Jefferson wrote that our freedom depends on the freedom of the press and there can be no limit
 samvidhan ke sansthaapakon se lekar sabhi dalon ke netaaon ko media se shikaayatein rahi hai
 The media has been accused but the press has always been respected as an institution
 bahut lambey samay kii baat nahin he jab republican raashtrapati ronald regan ne kaha tha ki mukt press kii hamaari parampara hamaare loktantr kaa abhinn or mahatvapurn ang rahaa he or rahegaa
 In 1971, Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black wrote that the job of the press is to serve the governed and not the ruler
 aaj trump apane saath usee media ko lekar le jate hai jo unke netritv kii vakaalat karata he
 Does not question
 dekha jaae to sirf raashtrapati hi apane raajnneetik or nijee phaayde ke liye logon main vibhaajan nahin kar rahe hai
 They also ask their supporters to follow what they are saying
 pichley maheene consaas main unhone kaha tha ki bas hamaari suno, ye log (press) jo bakawaas dikhaate hai us par yakeen mat karo
 So remember that what you are watching or studying is not just happening

 In the first 558 days of his tenure, he has made 4,229 false claims
 washington post ne unke jhuthe daavon kii suchi banaai he
 Yet there are only 17 percent of Trump's supporters who believe that the US administration continues to lie
 unka jhooth hi tathy banataa ja rahaa he
 For citizens equipped with information, lies deny their existence
 america kii mahanata is par nirbhar he ki mukt press satta ke saamne khulkar satya kaa bayaan kare
 It is not American tradition to stick the public's enemy label on the press

 In the ninth annual report of the Chhattisgarh Public Commission presented by Chief Minister Raman Singh in the Legislative Assembly, Chief of State Lokayukta Justice LC Bhadu remarked that along with increase in industry, resourcefulness, economic growth in India, corruption has also increased
 bhrashtachar ke virodh main lagaataar karrwai ke baad bhi yah samasya din-ba-din badhati ja rahi he
 Bhadu has said that in the year 2011, there have been innumerable cases of corruption, inaction, post misuse etc
 at the center and state level
 udaraharan swaroop 2ji spectrum, asian khelon ke aayojan main bhrashtachar evam vibhinn prakaar ke khanan patte jari karne main, rajkeey bhoomi aavanton, janhit main bharat sarkaar or rajya sarkaar dwaara jo yojanaayen jaise manaregaa, pradhanmantri sadak yojana tathaa van kshetra kii sabhi yojanaon main bhrashtachar ke maamle bhi prakaash main aae hai
 It would not be an exaggeration to say that no government scheme is corruption free at this time
 unhone kaha he ki bhrashtachar rokane ke liye rajyon main lokayukta kaa gathan kiya gaya he, lekin lokayukta adhiniyamon main samuchit prabhaavshaalee praavdhaan nahin hone, lokayukta sanghathanon ko vaanchit suvidhaayen, adhosanrachana or jaanch karne vaali agenciyaan uplabdh nahin karaane ke kaaran janata kii aashaa ke anuroop lokayukta sanghathan bhi prabhavi rup se kaary karne main asamarth rahe hai

 Bhadu has said that it is undisputed that the objective with which the Lokayukta institution was formed has not been able to fulfill the expectation of the people
 lokayukta adhinium ke praavdhaanon ke anusaar sakasham praadhikari sambandhit lok sevak ke khilaaf teen maah main karrwai kar avgat karaane kaa praavdhaan kiya gaya he, lekin lokayukta kii anushansa par vashron tak samuchit karrwai nahin kii jaati he, kyonki karrwai usee vibhaag ke adhikariyon dwaara kii jaati he
 Therefore, the officers of the department try to save the public servant rather than punish him
 tippaniyan The Chief Lokayukta has said that in view of the flaws in the current Lokayukta Acts, the Lokpal Act is being drafted in the new Lokpal Act in view that the Lokpal is being empowered to investigate corruption against Lok Sevak after investigation by Lokpal Once established, it will be necessary for the punishment and the competent authority by the Lokpal to follow the order passed by the Lokayukta
 And follow is not to be created to provide the same kind of penalty on the competent authority
