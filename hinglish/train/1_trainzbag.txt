 Gold is the most perfect here, the king of the jungle walks in awe, colors are more colorful and passion is more energetic
 saurashtra rajavaadon kaa ek jhuramut he or yahaan kii raajnneeti bhi rajasi he
 The Saurashtra region which is decorated with seven rich districts is different from Gujarat in many ways
 2002 ke dangon main bhi ye ilaaka shantipurna hi rahaa tha
 The issues here are not communal, social, economic, and are related to common life
 gujarat kii 182 main se 54 siten saurashtra ke ilaake main hi hai
 If there is a heavy lift in this area, the padding may become a fog
 har raajnneetik party ko iskaa ahsaas he
 That is why Sonia Gandhi also thought of blowing the bugle in Gujarat, then started from Rajkot
 isaki ek badi vajah ye bhi he ki raajnneetik vishaleshak is dfa puure gujarat main saurashtra ko hi modi kii kamazor kadi maan rahe hai
 Actually former state Chief Minister Keshubhai Patel, the most powerful leader of Saurashtra, has left the BJP and raised the Gujarat Parivartan Party with the slogan of Parivartan
 keshubhai kii saurashtra ilaake main jahaan pakad rahi he vahiin wo sanghathan ke bhi maahir rahe hai
 In 2001, when Keshubhai was removed from the Chief Minister's post, Modi held the chair, the card of hidden betrayal was played
 asar siton main nahin dikhaa
 Then in 2007, Keshubhai appealed to Patel voters not to win to Modi
 nateeja bilkul ulat dikhaa
 But in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, a similar appeal against the BJP candidate from Rajkot paid off
 or party 20 saal main pehali baar ye seat ganvaa baithi
 For BJP, Keshubhai built Patel vote bank in brick by brick Gujarat
 yahaan akalan kii mushkil ye he ki gujarat main jatigat vot adhiktar vibhajit hi rahete hai
 Traditionally, many Patels vote in favor of the Congress
 aise main keshubhai kiske vot bank main send lagaayenge, ye spasht nahin he
 There have been many appreciative rebellions in the past decade citing Modi's talk and arrogance
 lekin gujarat ne modi ko kamazor nahin hone diya he
 His strength has grown so much that he is claiming the claim to Delhi
 yahi vajah he ki keshubhai se lekar congress tak us mudde par chot kar rahe hai jo logon se sidhaa judaa he
 Water crisis in Saurashtra has given unmatched beauty to Saurashtra
 agar nahin diya he to pani kaa aisa strot jo 12 maheene logon kii bhi pyaas buja sake or kheton kii bhi
 This area is completely dependent on rain water
 modi ke 11 saal ke kaarykaal main pehali baar gujarat main is saal sookhe jaisi sthiti bani
 The monsoon came late, but it did not come well
 or jab tak aayaa tab tak lagbhag 48 kisaanon ne apni jaan de di thi
 Most of them were Saurashtra farmers
 haalanki aarope ye bhi lagaae gaye ki modi sarkaar ne zyaadaatar mauton ko kisaanon kii aatmahatya maanane se inkaar kar diya
 Otherwise this figure would have been more
 baharhaal, aankadon main lipte dard kaa ahsaas to un logon ko he jinhone apano ko kho diya
 What cloud left the sky, 25-year-old Vikram lost his spirits
 karj kaa boj aisa ki apane khet main isi ped par faansee lagaakar vikram ne jaan de di
 The father was paralyzed
 or 15 janon ke parivaar ko paalane ke liye chota bhai sangharsh kar rahaa he
 The state government avoided calling suicide a farmer-suicide
 par congress ne jhat lakh-lakh rupye kaa check har peedit parivaar ko thama diya
 Well, the family did not get hurt by the lack of compensation
 wo to aahat hai kisi ne unki toh tak nahin lee
 This story may be of a family, this story is old
 kaash ki hamaare rajaneta ye samaj sakate ki dard ko gussa banate vakt nahin lagati
 Everyone is aware of this problem of Saurashtra region
 par ab tak sari koshishen bas kaagajon par simati rahi hai
 Now the Modi government is claiming that there will be water in every house as soon as it returns to power
 baharhaal pani ek aisa masalaa he jise saurashtra ke zyaadaatar log apni takadir se jodate hai
 This time the politics of tears played on water will rain votes, it has to be seen
 aam aadmi party (AAP) ne dilli vidhansabha main bijepi koneta vipaksh kaa paddene par koi faisla nahin kiya he
 On Thursday, Manish Sisodia, who is said to be an MLA from Patparganj and a future deputy CM, said that the party has not taken any decision yet, but it will consider it
 unhone kaha, 'kam se kam bijepi ko isaki maang to karne dijie
 We have not taken any decision yet
 ' yaad rahe ki varisht AAP netaa kumaar vishwaas ne nateezon ke din 10 farvari ko twit kar kaha tha ki agar bijepi saat se kam siten bhi laai, tab bhi ham use netaa vipaksh kaa pad denge
 Even if BJP gets less thn 7 seats we will give LOP to BJP
 loktantr sweekaar se chalata he
 - Dr Kumar Vishvas (@drkumarvishwas) February 10, 2015 It is worth noting that the post of Leader of Opposition in an Assembly or Lok Sabha can be given to a person of the same party who has won at least 10 percent of the seats
 haalia chunaav nateezon main bijepi kii karaari haar hui he or use 70 main sirf 3 siten mili hai
 However, the experts of the constitution say that the government can give the post of opposition to the party which has won less than 10 percent of the seats as per their wish
 loksabhaa main congress ne sirf 44 siten jiti thim jo 10 fisadi se kam hai
 The Modi government at the Center had refused to give the post of Leader of Opposition to the Congress
 vahiin varisht bijepi netaa or rohinee se vidhayak vijendra gupta kaa kahana he ki unka AAP se netaa vipaksh kaa pad maangane kaa koi iraadaa nahin he

 centre kii modi sarkaar apane kaarykaal kaa aakhri bajet pesh karne ko taiyaar he
 Prime Minister Modi has made it clear that this will be an interim budget, but the way the speculation is, and after the preparation of the government, it seems that this time the budget is going to be very special
 pichley sansad satr main kendriya mantri ravishankar prasad ne kaha tha ki ye slog overs main sarkaar kai chakke lagane vaali he, aise main bajet wo mauka he jab ummid kii ja rahi he ki sarkaar raahat ke pitare khol sakati he
 Most of the politics in the last few months has been on the condition of the farmers
 isliye bajet kisaanon vaala ho jaae to badi baat nahin he
 So let's take a look at what can be announced for the farmers
 - kisaanon kii kamai main madad dene kii kisi yojana kaa elaan ho saktaa he
 - Increase on agricultural loans with low interest rates may be announced
 - fasalon par emspi sidhe bank khate main pahunchane ke upaay sambhav hai, saath hi khaadya fasalon par beemaa kaa premium maaf karne kaa prastaav sambhav he
 - Small farmers can get help of 4 to 5 thousand rupees per acre annually
 kisaan credit card se 5 lakh rupye tak ke karj par byaaj main raahat sambhav he
 Apart from the farmers, the middle class also has high expectations from the government regarding the budget
 sarkaar iskar dene waalon kii taadaad main badhottaree ko apni uplabdhi ke taur par ginaati he, isliye is baar sarkaar bhi in ummiido ko puraa kar sakati he

 The data released by the National Sample Survey Office has added to Modi's concern
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi samet anya vipakshi netaa is mudde par sarkaar ko gher rahe hai
 - Let us tell you that according to the latest data from the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO), the unemployment rate in the country is 6
 1 fisadi he
 This figure is at the highest level of 45 years, before the unemployment rate in the country was more than 6 percent in 1972-73
 - haalanki pichley 15 maheene main EPFO ke aankadon main acchhee growth dikhi he lekin jitne rojgaar kii jarurat he ye usase behad kam hai
 In such a situation, in order to get this election year and youth vote, Modi government can also make some big announcement about youth

 pune main haalanki kohli ne 254 ran kii jaadui pari kheli jo unke kariyar kaa sarvshereshth pradarshan bhi he
 Rohit could not walk in Pune and would like to make up for it in Ranchi while Cheteshwar Pujara, who has scored two half-centuries in the series so far, will be trying to reach the triple digits
 bharat ne ab tak siries main keval 16 wicket ganvaae hai jabaki usne dakshin africa ko donon test maichon main buree tarah post kiya
 From this, India's dominance can also be estimated

 In front of the spinners, the last time South Africa visited South Africa, the spinners gave it a living, but this time both the fast bowler and spinner have played an important role
 umesh yadav ne pune test match main shandaar vaapasi kii jabaki wicketiper riddhimaan saaha ne kuch behtareen kaich lapke
 Kohli kept an extra fast bowler in Pune as Umesh which did not allow Hanuma Vihari to make a place in the playing XI
 abhi yah tay nahin he ki kohli is sangyojan ke saath utrenge yaa isamen badlaav karenge
 Ranchi's pitch for spinners: South African captain du Plessis has already said that Ranchi's pitch will be suited to spinners and so a third spinner in the form of Kuldeep Yadav could also make it to the Indian playing eleven
 dakshin africa ballebaajon ne vishakhapatnam main kuch dam dikhaaya tha lekin pune main ve naakaam rahe the
 Only the tail batsmen troubled the Indian bowlers

 pakistan main ghuskar aatanki thikaanon par bhartiya vayusena ke dwaara kii gai air strike ke baad se hi rashtriya suraksha kaa mudda raajnneeti ke centre main aa gaya he
 After the Pulwama terror attack, the anger against Pakistan in the country was reflected in India's retaliation
 airstrike ke baad bharat kaa rukh pakistan ke khilaaf kaisaa hona chahie, iskaa loksabhaa chunaavon main kya asar padegaa in sabhi baton par charchaa karne ke liye ajtak ne aaj vishesh ‘suraksha sabha’kaa aayojan kiya he
 On the topic of 'how safe are we', Sitaram Yechury, the General Secretary of the Marxist Communist Party (CPM), said that there is no favor and opposition in national security
 rashtriya suraksha ke liye mahatvapurn he
 The entire country, both sides and the opposition, stand together against terror
 aatankwaadi chaahate hai ki hamaare bich foot pade, ham laden taaki use phayda ho
 Sadly, more than the government and the government, the media tries to spread divisions among the masses, while there is a need for unity among us
 jo foot daal rahaa he, desh main vah deshadrohi he or jo desh main ekta chahta he, vah deshbhakt he
 Speaking on national security, Yechury said, "why is the issue of terrorism and security coming on the agenda today?" Why is it coming after Balakot? Internal security and terrorism have always been serious issues
 raashtra kii suraksha hameshaa mudda he, sirf chunaav ke liye nahin he
 Comparing these 5 years from the 5 years of 2009 to 2014, there were 626 terrorist attacks in these 5 years, whereas in the first 5 years there were less
 un 5 saalon main 139 jawan shahid hue jabaki in 5 saalon main 483 jawan shahid hue
 Incidents of ceasefire which occurred 563 years in the first 5 years, more than 5000 ceasefire violations in these 5 years
 rashtriya suraksha kaa masalaa pulavama or balakot ke baad hi mudda kyon? uske baad hamaare itane sainik shahid hue, kitne aatanki hamale hue, jammu ke andar aatanki hamale hue
 What is our alertness? The question should be whether we are safe or not? On the talk of intelligence failure, the failure of intelligence in the Yechuripulwama attack, Yechury said that there was intelligence failure before the Pulwama attack, which was first raised by the Governor of Jammu and Kashmir
 And this question is valid
 sena ke alaava suraksha kii baat ho to ye bhi ho ki hamaara anndaata surakshit he ki nahin? hamaara berozegaar laachaar hokar gum rahaa he, kya vah surakshit he? suraksha ke sabhi maamalon ko ek balakot tak agar aap simit kar denge or uske aadhaar par chunaav ladane kii baat aap kar rahe hai to ye sabase bada desh ke saath anyaay he
 On the politicization of the air strike, Yechury said that the BJP president started politicizing on the air strike and said that it is not the Congress government and the BJP will take strong action
 hamane to kaha ki ham sarkaar ke har kadam main aatankwaad ke khilaaf saath hai
 We praised the Air Force the next day a political statement came from Amit Shah
 sawaal yah nahin he ki iskaa raajnneetikaran kiya, lekin iskaa phayda unheen aatankwaadiyon ko hoga jo hamaare bich foot daalana chahta he
 The BJP president said that 200 killed, Rajnath Singh said there were 300 mobiles which stopped after the attack
 ek cabinet mantri ne kaha ki 400 maare, lekin vahiin ek duusare cabinet mantri ne kaha ki vahaan hamaara makasad maarna nahin tha balki apni kshamta dikhaanaa tha
 The Air Force Chief answered all the questions and was saluted by the entire country
 unhone kaha ki meraa kaam tha target ko nishaanaa bananaa or usko nishaanaa banaaya gaya
 He performed his responsibility bravely
 chunaav main phayda milane ke laalach se desh kii suraksha ke saath samjhautarashtriya suraksha par baat karte hue yechuri ne kaha ki rashtriya suraksha kaa yah masalaa hameshaa jinda he
 Everyone has to fight together
 ye desh bhakt he, wo desh virdohi he
 By saying all this, you are getting caught in the trap of terrorists
 ek chunaav main phayda milane ke laalach se aap desh kii suraksha ke saath samjhauta kar rahe hai
 The report by Murali Manohar Joshi, head of the defense committee, says that investment in defense is the lowest since 1962
 hamaari suraksha kii taiyaariyaan itani kamjor hai to kya us par charchaa nahin honi chahie
 Tu-tu, I-I will get votes in the elections, but will you pledge the country for that? If you are talking about security, then give security to the people of the country
 bhukhmaree ko mitaao, anndaata ko suraksha do, anndaata ko aatmahatya karne se bachaao, naujavaanon ko naukariyaan do
 Yechury further said, "why doesn't anyone ask that question when Azhar Masood was in your custody, how did he get rid of it?" Who left him and came? Why is that plane allowed to fly in Amritsar? How did the plane go to Kandhar? If the world is asking questions, then show them the evidence, while clearing his stand on Samsood Azhar, Yechury said that declare Masood Azhar an international terrorist
 sawaal ye he ki kaarywahi kya hogi? america, france or britain sawaal puch rahaa he ki aap saboot dijie
 We trust the army but if the world is asking questions then show them the proof
 kashmir main vidhansabha chunaav na hone par yechuri ne kaha ki agar loksabhaa chunaav ke liye suraksha vyavastha thik he to vidhansabha chunaav ke liye kyon nahin? kashmir main agar raajnneetik prakriya kii baat ho rahi he to sabase pehle aap janatantr kaa hissaa bane
 a roadmap was prepared in the case of Kashmir when the All Party Delegation led by Rajnath Singh went to Kashmir 3 years ago and after arrival a written statement was issued under which the Confidence Building Major should be ready, and all the stakes Interact with the holder
 yah rasta desh ke saamne rakhaa gaya tha lekin agar aap chaahate hai to use lagu bhi karen
 Separate people from separatists, this is the biggest process
 kashmir kii samasya kaa samaadhaan karne ke liye ek kadam yahi he logon ko algaavvaadiyon se alag karo jeet kar
 i myself am a separatist in this matter and i want people to be separated from the separatists
 ek taraf modi khadey hai duusari taraf sab log, ye media kaa propaganda haimahagathbandhan par bolte hue yechuri ne kaha ki ek taraf modi khadey hai duusari taraf sab log, ye media kaa propaganda he
 There was no Grand Alliance before the elections in India
 1996, 1998 or 2004 main mahagathbandhan hua par isi tarah 2019 chunaav ke baad mahagathbandhan hoga
 If Modi says that this grand alliance is a great adulteration, then our country is an adulteration where we all live together from Bengal to Rajasthan, from Kashmir to Kanyakumari
 bharat kaa matlab hi milawat he
 We all live together
 aap usko mitaanaa chaahate hai jo desh ke khilaaf he
 15 years ago, when this question was asked, what would be the option of Vajpayee? We had said that the option would come from the people of the country and that option came from the public after which there was stability in the country under the leadership of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh for 10 consecutive years
 chunavi aadhaar par left main giravat hui he lekin logon ke mudde ko saamne laane kaa agenda left tay kar rahaa he
 These days, there are unique trends to make films superhit
 koi filmon main videshi technology kaa sahaara letaa he to koi videshi kalakaaron kaa
 But 'nasha' director Amit Saxena is different
 punam pandey kii is film ko populerity dilaane ke liye unhone iske poster par jamkar mehnat kii he
 As viewers may be watching, the two naked legs of Poonam have been shown in it giving an interesting look to the film's poster, but according to sources, these legs also have a story of their own
 sutron ke mutabik punam kii taangon ko khubasurat dikhaane ke liye in par khaas tarah kaa mechap kiya gaya he jiske liye lagbhag 4 se 5 ghante lage
 The interesting thing was that for this makeup, Poonam had to sit for 5 hours continuously in one place in a two piece bikini and that too in full AC
 yah aisa mechap tha jiske liye thandak kii darkaar thi so aise main na chaahate hue bhi punam ko kam kapadon main bina kisi shikaayat ke itani thand main baithna pada
 The interesting thing is that no other technology has been taken to make Poonam's legs seen in the poster beautiful
 ab samaj aayaa punam kii sexi taangon kaa raaj

 These green firecrackers have been prepared from the joint research of CSIR and NEERI
 in pataakhon kaa parikshan paryaavaran mantralay ke saath tamilnadu ke shivganga main bhi kiya gaya

 The government claims that the price of these firecrackers will be the same as the old firecrackers

 pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri or trinmul congress supremeo mamata banerjee ek baar phir vivaadon main ghir gai hai
 This time, it is the case of Ramzan and Mecca, the holy festival of Muslims
 darasal trinmul congress ne ramajaan ke pavitra maheene main sahari or iftaar kaa ek time teble chhapavaya he, jisamen mamata banerjee kii tasviir bhi chhaapi gai he
 There is a lot of anger among the Muslim community about this time table and the picture of Mamta printed on it
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki is time teble main jahaan ek taraf mamata banerjee muslim bhaiyon ko is pavitra tyohaar kii badhai de rahi hai, vahiin unke peeche makka kii tasviir lagaai gai he
 Muslims say that Muslims have been insulted directly by printing a picture of a holy place like Mecca
 unka kahana he ki mamata ne apni namaaj padhate hue tasviir chhapavakar thik nahin kiya he or ye muslim dharm ke khilaaf he
 The worship of any picture or idol is forbidden in the Muslim religion
 darasal bardwan main trinmul congress ne sahari or iftaar kii ek samay-suchi chhapavai he, jisamen mamata kii namaaj padhate hue tasviir front pej par chhapi he or sabase badi baat ye ki back pej par makka kii tasviir chhaapi gai he
 Significantly, Mecca is the largest shrine for Muslims
 bardwan ke musalamaanon kaa kahana he ki ye makka kii tauheen he
 Apart from this, Burdwan's Muslims have reservations about the Iftar party event of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee
 unka kahana he ki mamata dhongi hai, drama kar rahi hai or unhen is tarah kii raajnneeti band kerani chahie
 Muslim religious gurus say that leaflet printing is a publicity stunt of Mamta
 unka kahana he ki makka hamaara dharmik sthaan he or use lifalate par peeche chhapana uskaa apmaan he, use pehle pej par chhapana chahie tha
 She says, Mamta Banerjee often says that she believes in Muslim religion, but she does not believe in the heart

 It all depends on which team keeps itself calm and overcomes the circumstances

 'india have given the captain Virat Kohliko a rest from the Asia Cup and this can make the road easier for Pakistan

 rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (aresas) ne aligarh muslim vishvavidhyalay kii alpsankhyak manyata khatm kiye jane ke mudde par kisi bhi tarah ke samjhaute yaa sarkaar ke faisle main dakhal dene se inkaar kiya he
 Regarding the minority recognition of AMU AMU is a national university, the highly placed source of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh told 'aaj Tak' that the Sangh is fully in agreement with the affidavit filed by the Central Government in the Supreme Court regarding the minority recognition of AMU, in which it It has been said that Aligarh Muslim University is constitutionally not a minority institution but a national university
 And in this, all the rules and regulations of the Center should be implemented like other universities
 AMU par nahin badale hai RSS ke vichaareemyu ke kulapati jameer uddin shah kii aresas se baatcheet ke bare main ucch padasth sutara ne bataaya ki loktantric vyavastha main koi kisi se bhi milane or apni baat kehane ke liye swatantra he
 This does not mean that the RSS is going to bring about any change in its view of AMU
 AMU par court ke faisle kaa intjardesh kii purvavarti sarkaron ne aligarh muslim vishvavidhyalay ke alpsankhyak santhaan hone ke bare main jo bhram paidaa kiye or court ko bhi baar-baar gumraah karne kii koshish kii, use doharaate rahane se desh ko yaa phir eemyu ko koi laabh nahin hone vaala he
 The matter is pending in the Supreme Court and the decision of the court will decide the future of the minority character of Aligarh Muslim University, so everyone should wait for the verdict

 RSS sources categorically deny the claim that the AMU has played a big role in bringing the Muslim society into the mainstream of modern education and the Sangh also wants that the Muslim mindset moves with the mainstream of the country with modern education He stepped through and proceeded

 Everything else is fine, but


 Obama warmly shook hands with all the leaders

 i continued to read ballads in appreciation republic de parade kii har baariki par gaur farmaate rahe or modi se lagaataar unke bare main samajhate rahe
 Was there anything else going on in his mind the whole time? Were issues like business and nuclear deals just a point of agenda tied to formalities? Was the real agenda different? And on the go, he said his Mann Ki Baat [although the 'mann Ki Baat' program had already been recorded, which aired after Obama's departure] said, "until India Will continue to earn success until it is divided on religious grounds
 ”obama ne america or bharat donon mulkon main shiksha or samaan avasar kaa zikr kiya or kaha - tabhi to ek chaay bechney vaala pradhanmantri ban jaataa he or ek khaanaa banane vaale kaa pota raashtrapati ban jaataa he
 Obama gave many such beautiful examples, but the main emphasis was on religious tolerance
 kya vaaki, bharat ko lekar obama kii asli chintaa yahi he?sarkaar nahin to kiske sandarbh main?congress netaa digvijay singh ne modi ko obama ke bhaashan se sabak lene kii salaah di he
 However, he has raised the question that Modi does not have the courage to stop the Vishwa Hindu Parishad and Sangh people running the movement on the issue of conversion
 argedy adhyaksh lalu prasad yadav kaa aarope he ki obama ne bijepi or aresas ke munh par kaalikh pot di he
 Lalu asks, "prime Minister Narendra Modi should tell what will his good friends do now on what he has said? Will their program of homecoming continue or stop? ”in his address to the nation on the eve of Republic Day, President Pranab Mukherjee has also said that religion cannot be made a cause of conflict
 apane sambodhan main raashtrapati ne ‘unmaad se bhari pratispardhaa’ kii bhi ninda kii
 And, BJP spokesperson GVL Narasimha Rao says that religious tolerance and freedom is not only a constitution, but it has been a part of the great tradition of this country
 ham is par to hajaaron saal se duniya ko paath padhaate aa rahe hai
 According to a BJP spokesperson, it would be wrong to say that Obama has spoken about religious tolerance and freedom in the context of the Modi government

 IAS officer Amit Khare was the deputy commissioner of West Singhbhum district falling in Bihar and now Jharkhand in 1996
 us vakt unki hi jaanch main sabase pehle chaara ghotaale kaa khulaasa hua tha
 After this, the Bihar government led by Lalu Prasad continuously gave him poor postings and once even canceled his father's sick leave
 majabuuran amit ko waapas duty par lautnaa padaa or tabhi unke pita ji kaa dehanth ho gaya
 45-year-old Amit Khare, currently Joint Secretary in the Ministry of Human Resource Development, breathed a sigh of relief and satisfaction after Lalu Prasad Yadav was convicted in the fodder scam on Monday
 majaak main unhone yah bhi kaha ki mujhe to lagata tha ki ritairement ke baad bhi is tarah kii khabar milegi
 How the fodder scam unfolded Speaking to an English newspaper, Khare told that shortly after he was made DC of West Singhbhum district, an alert came from the Finance Department of Bihar
 isamen pashupaalan or matsay vibhaag kii taraf se har rajya main kii jane vaali dhananikasi par najar rakhane ko kaha gaya
 On 27 January 1996, Khare was shocked when he sought answers on the suspicious economic activities of the Chaibasa Animal Husbandry Center in his district
 bakaul khare november or disambar ke maheene main vibhaag kii taraf se is centre ke liye 10 or 9 karod rupee kii nikasi dikhaai gai thi
 i thought that i would call the animal husbandry officer and investigate this
 magar jaise hi phone kiya gaya, mujhe pataa chalaa ki vibhaag ke saare adhikari daftar chhodkar bhaag khadey hue hai
 Amit Khare said that when we visited the office of the department, we saw that there was a pile of fake bills
 kuch lakh cash idhar udhar bikharaa padaa he or ek bhi adhikari daftar main maujuud nahin he
 When the police alert was sent, it was found that other offices of the department have also maintained the same condition
 natijatan, sabhi daftar sil kar die gaye or aupchaarik shikaayat darj kar lee gai
 Khare informed the state government about this, but Lalu Prasad Yadav's government turned a blind eye to it
 phir shuru hua amit khare ko sajaa dene kaa daurchaara ghotaale kaa khulaasa karne ke kuch hi maheenon ke bheetar unhen bimaaru haalat or bandi kii kagaar par pade bihar state ledar corporation main damp kar diya gaya
 The condition of the corporation was that for the last six months, the salaries had not been paid to its employees
 phir kuch samay baad khare ko bihar kambind state ejamination board kaa controlar banaakar bhej diya gaya
 At that time the board was only on paper
 khare ne ise vidhivat sthapit kiya or ab yah safaltaapurvak chal rahaa he
 The most difficult phase for Khare came in 1997, when his father was ill
 khare ne bataaya ki maine pita ji ko aspataal main dikhwane ke liye chuttee lee
 But the holiday was dismissed as soon as i reached my house
 mujhe waapas patna talab kar liya gaya
 Meanwhile, my father passed away
 khare kii mushkilen tab jaakar kuch kam huin, jab alag rajya banane ke baad vah jharkhand cader main chale gaye
 During the investigation of the fodder scam, he was constantly pressurized, but he did not bow down
 khare kehete hai ki ab main yuva iees adhikariyon se puri jimmedaari se yah kah saktaa hum ki apane kartavya kaa nisthapurvak paalan karen or kisi bhi galat satta ke aage na jhuken
 In this system, there are measures to protect them and to do the right thing

 Former Indian captain Sunil Gavaskar has termed Sachin Tendulkar's retirement from international cricket as the greatest moment ever, while another legendary player VVS Laxman believes that the farewell arrangements of the Bengal Cricket Association will not distract the veteran batsman
 yah poochne par ki westeindies ke khilaaf do test kii shrinkhalaa ke baad tendulkar kaa sanyas kya ab tak kaa sabase bada sanyas he jise vishwa cricket ne dekha he, gavaskar ne kaha, mujhe aisa hi lagata he
 Any renunciation is welcomed with sorrow
 18 november ke baad tendulkar kabhi maidan par khelte hue nahin dikhegaa
 Therefore, this environment can be understood
 sar don breadman ke baad vah sabase bada cricketer he or uskaa sanyas in sabhi ke bich sabase bada he
 Gavaskar also targeted the media, which according to him continued to speculate about Tendulkar's sannyas until the cricketer himself announced it officially
 unhone ek tivi channel se kaha, main aap logon ko kahata aayaa hum ki aapako nahin pataa ki jab vah sanyas le legaa to aapako kis cheez kii kami khalegi
 Laxman said that Tendulkar's innings in his Ranji Trophy match against Haryana in Lahli would boost morale as it was played in difficult conditions
 unhone kaha, ‘unhone duusari pari main match vijeta pari kheli lekin main jis cheez se adhik prabhavit hum vah wo samay he jo unhone krij par bitaayaa
 Both Gavaskar and Laxman believe that the grand arrangements of the cab for Tendulkar's farewell will not distract the veteran batsman as many believe
 gavaskar or lakshmana donon saath hi is baat par bhi sahamat dikhe ki rohit sharma test cricket main padaarpan karne ke liye puri tarah se taiyaar hai
 Laxman said, 'yes, of course
 vah test padaarpan ke liye taiyaar he
 It is good for India to see consistency in his performance since starting the innings in ODI cricket
 vah naa sirf match vijeta pari khel rahaa he balki usne jo aakraamakata dikhaai vah behtareen he
 i think he too wants to play Test matches now
 ’ gavaskar ne kaha, ‘haa, vah iske liye taiyaar he

 Based on these two comments, Passport Officer Vikas Mishra took further action at his level and the case caught fire
 ab videsh mantralay kaa kahana he ki sanshodhit passport niyam ke anusaar passport ke liye aavedan karne ke dauraan marij certificate jamaa karne kii koi jarurat nahin he, kyonki marij certificate main darshaae gaye naam kii koi praasangikta nahin he
 The second dispute regarding the Aadhaar-bank account was necessary for the address, on which the Ministry of External Affairs says that Tanvi Seth had submitted his Aadhaar card and a joint bank account as a confirmation of his name and address and that is the name of the application form
 i was also jo nae niyamon ke mutabik sahi tha
 Earlier on Wednesday, during the passport issuance, local passport officer Piyush Verma said that the passports of Tanvi Seth and Anas Siddiqui have been issued
 videsh mantralay ke june 2018 ke niyamon ke anusaar police report main 6 ahm binduon main agar aavedak par koi aapraadhik cese nahin he or uski naagarikta par koi vivaad nahin he to passport nahin roka ja saktaa
 On this basis, passports have been issued to Tanvi and Anas
 marij certificate maangana galatpura maamla saamne aane ke baad sarkaar kii ore se ek aantarik jaanch kii gai jisamen paaya gaya ki dastavej ke liye karyaalay main apana aavedan dene gaye hindu-muslim danpati se dharm ke bare main apraasangik sawaal poochne vaala lakhanu kaa passport adhikari (vikaas mishra) galat tha
 Sources said that Uttar Pradesh Police also made a mistake in gathering their residence and other irrelevant details during the verification process required for issuing passports
 saath hi tanvi seth se poochtacha karne vaale passport adhikari vikaas mishra kaa marij certificate maangana bhi galat tha
 According to the rules, this certificate is not required for passports if other documents are found to be correct
 ek baar police satyaapan ke baad passport jari kar diya jaataa he or dobaaraa satyaapan kii zarurat sirf aapraadhik record or naagarikta sambandhi dikkaton ke baad hi hoti he
 And there was no such record against the couple in this case
 isi vajah se passport ke liye dobaaraa police satyaapan kii koi zarurat nahin thi
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi started the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan on Teachers' Day, then Gandhi Jayanti, and now on October 11, Modi is going to launch the Sansad Adarsh gram Yojana on the birth anniversary of Jai Prakash Narayan
 is yojana ke tahat saansadon ko ek gaanv god lenaa hoga or ye sunishchat karnaa hoga ki vahaan ke log garibi se baahar aaen or is muhim kaa kendra banengi gram panchayatein
 In his August 15 speech at Red Fort, PM Modi appealed to the mps to adopt a village in a year, which has come to an end
 11 oktober ko lokanayak jaiprakash narayan ke janmdin ke avasar par modi saansad adarsh gram yojana ko hari jhandi denge
 Invitations have been sent to all mps of Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha to participate in this program
 gramin vikaas mantralay ne iskaa ek blue print bhi taiyaar kar liya he
 Under this, gram panchayats will be made the point of development
 aise chune jaaenge adarsh gaanv1
 a population ranging from 3000 to 5000 will be chosen in the plains
 pahari, adivasee or durgam ilaakon main 1000 se 3000 hajaar kii aabaadi or jin ilaakon main itani aabaadi nahin vahaan gram panchayaton ko gaanv chunane kaa adhikaar diya jayega
 2
 har saansad ek gaanv chunane ke liye swatantra hoga lekin wo apana yaa phir apni patni ke gaanv ko god nahin le paaegaa
 3
 loksabhaa saansad ko apane kshetra se gaanv chunanaa hoga or rajyasabha saansad jin rajyon se chun kar aaen hai vahaan kaa gaanv god le sakate hai
 Nominated mps will be able to adopt a village in any district of the country
 4
 The MP must adopt one village immediately and after a short time, two villages will have to be selected
 5
 The objective is to choose three villages
 
 
 march 2019 tak 3 adarsh gaanv taiyaar ho saken
 After that, by the year 2024, 5 more model villages will be ready according to one village
 darasal gaanv ko god lene ke is karyrakram kaa mukhya makasad hi he ki gaanv kaa har ghar garibi se baahar nikal kar aae
 It will also be ensured that all the people of the village become partners in this development work, and facilities will also be given such that these role models can be made for the rest of the villages
 in gaanvon main moolbhoot suvidhaayen to di hi jaaengi lekin saath main asamanta ko kam karne or rojgaar ke behatar avasar bhi pradaan kiye jaaenge
 However, a time limit will also be set for this so that all these programs in one village are completed in one year
 jaise adarsh gaanv ek maheene main tay ho jaaen
 In this village, the awareness campaign should be completed in two months, the first phase should be completed in three months and the project should be approved in 8 months
 nauven maheene main kaam kaaj shuru ho jaae or ek saal ke baad kaam kaa uski samiksha shuru kar di jaae
 The government has also identified the difficulties faced by it
 
 
 1
 The work being done for development and the needs of the society is not far away
 2
 Not all sections of society are made partners
 kai maukon par suvidhaayen aisi jagahon par de di jaati hai jisase kai varg alag thalag pad jate hai
 At the same time political partisanship also increases difficulties
 3
 Relying only on government for money

 aapako bataa den ki november se farvari tak 4 maheene dilli main pradooshan kaa str sabase zyada rahata he
 During this time, Delhi seems to be turning into a gas chamber
 aise main aksar ye sawaal uthte hai ki aakhir pradooshan se nipatane ke liye har saal sarkari taiyaariyaan kyon adhuri rahati hai? sarkaar dilli ke pradooshan ko rokane main naakaam kyon ho jaati he? kejariwal sarkaar ne 2 janvari ko dilli main pradooshan ko rokane or paryaavaran ko behatar banane ke liye climet change se judaa ection plan paryaavaran mantralay ko saunpa tha
 The Union Environment Ministry has to give green signal to this action plan, for which NGT has given 4 weeks time to the Ministry
 paryaavaran mantralay kaa kahana he ki saal 2010 se ab tak dilli sarkaar ko climet change par ection plan report dene ke liye teen baar kaha gaya tha, lekin usne tab nahin diya or ab diya he
 This action plan related to the climate change handed over to the Ministry by the Government of Delhi includes not only air pollution, but also measures to prevent water pollution and increase the water level of Delhi going down continuously
 iske alaava ection plan main yah bhi zikr he ki kheti ke liye pani kaa istemaal kis tarah kiya jaae, jisase pani pradooshit na ho
 If this action plan is implemented in 4 weeks, then this time the level of pollution may also remain low during the winter starting in November and it will be easy for the government and agencies to control it before the emergencies like Delhi arise
 
 isse pehle engiti dilli main gaiyrkanoonee tareeke se chal rahi industries ko band karne ke aadesh dene se lekar kejariwal sarkaar par 50 karod rupee kaa jurmaana lagane jaise kade faisle liye the
 The ngt's intention behind these tough decisions is that Delhi's pollution will be curbed and the government takes some effective steps to improve the environment

 In Amritsar, Punjab, 60 people died in the horrific train accident, while more than 60 people were injured
 is haadase ke baad shuukravaar der raat kendrirel rajyamantri manoj sinhaghatnasthal par pahunche
 Manoj Sinha said, 'this is a very unfortunate incident
 soochna pate hi hamaari raahat team yahaan pahunch gai thi
 The entire railway administration is busy in providing better treatment to the injured
 iske alaava bharat sarkaar kii timen bhi isamen lagi hui hai
 'he said,' This subject is not about politics, we have a deep sympathy for the dead
 railway board ke chairman, general manager nordan railway samet kai bade adhikari maukey par hai
 The resources we have here are put up
 'ye puche jane par ki railway is ghatana par kya kadam uthayega, iske jawaab main sinha ne kaha ki yah ghatana railway kii galati se nahin ghati
 Such a program was organized next to the track and no information was given to the railways
 agar soochna rahati to ham pehle se isse sambandhit nirdesh jari karte
 Sinha further said that whatever instructions are already given to the driver, where the speed restriction resides, he slows down the speed
 meri pehali praathamikta ye he ki ham mritkon ke pariwaron or ghayalon ke liye behatar intjaam kar saken
 On the other hand, the Central Government and the State Government have started rejecting each other over the Amritsar accident
 centre sarkaar ne amritsar train haadase kii jimmedaari punjab sarkaar or amritsar ke sthaneey prashasan par daal di he
 Minister of State for Railways Manoj Sinha said that no such request was made from the railway that Ravana combustion would be done near the train track and any arrangement should be made in view of it
 is haadase ke baad sawaal uthne laga tha ki agar har saal yahaan ravan dahan kaa kaarykram yojit kiya jaataa he to railway ko trainon ko dhimi raftaar se chalaanaa chahie
 The Minister of State for Railways himself is going to Punjab to take stock of the situation
 vahiin, ravan dahan kaarykram main bataur guest maujuud navjot cor ne railway par haadase kii jimmedaari daal di he
 She is the wife of Navjot Singh Sidhu, a minister in the Punjab government
 ek chashmadid ne bataaya ki prashasan or dashahra cameti kii galati se yah ghatana hui he
 They should have ensured that the speed of the train here was kept slow during the program, but this could not be done
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki ravan dahan train trek ke paas hi yojit tha or ravan kaa putala jalaae jane ke dauraan pataakhon kii aawaaj aa rahi thi or jisase aati hui train kii aawaaj nahin sun sake
 Manoj Sinha said that naturally such programs should not be organized near railway tracks
 unhone kaha ki ise raajnneetik mudda nahin banaaya janaa chahie
 All of us together should bring relief to the people
 bataa den ki punjab ke amritsar main shuukravaar ko ek bhayanak haadase main ravan dahan dekh rahe log tej raftaar train kii chapet main aa gaye, jisase kam se kam 50 logon kii maut ho gai

 When India, Japan and the US held their first meeting of foreign ministers till now, New Delhi had said with great caution that it should not be considered as "a move against China
" '' do saal baad bhi nai dilli yahi baat kahana chahega
 But when India's Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj, Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono and US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson met in New York on September 18, the shadow of China seemed to be hovering larger than ever
 china ke utthan ko lekar chintaa nishchit rup se teenon deshon kii us vyavastha ko nae sire se prabhavit kar rahi thi jo chah saal pehle gathit hone ke baad se apana rasta bhatak gai he
 The status of Secretary level talks was raised to the level of foreign ministers during Obama's rule, but last year Donald Trump adopted the policy of America First (america First) and indicated the separation of America from Asia
 
 phir america trans-pacific partnership vyapaar saude se alag ho gaya or maang kii ki japan or dakshin korea america ke sahyogi ke rup main raksha gathjod banaae rakhane ke liye, uchit hisse kaa bhugtan karen
 Trump separated America from the Paris Climate Agreement and made it clear that American interests are first
 lekin beijing yadi is baat se khush he ki america ke alag hone se asia main ab ve nirankush ho gaye hai to haal kii kuch ghatnaon se saaf ho gaya he ki aisa nahin he
 The increased movement of American ships from North Korea to the South China Sea is a clear indication that distance in economic matters does not mean that the US is not interested in the region
 darasal, sanket yah he ki america sainik takat kaa pradarshan karne ke liye puri tarah taiyaar he
 In such a situation, the meeting of 18 September in New York was very important
 baithak main teenon deshon ke bich yah aam sahmati bani ki asia main america ke netritv main suraksha ke praaroop ko sangrakshit rakhana jaruri he, isse bharat or japan ko phayda hua, haalanki is par china kii badhati takat se dabaav pad rahaa he
 Like last year, the three countries have reiterated that they need to ensure freedom of navigation and trade
 saath hi ek kadam aage jate hue kshetra main chini sampark badaye jane kii koshishon ko lekar bharat kii chintaaon ko america or japan ne samajha
 Although the US and Japan sent their representatives to Chinese President Xi Jinping's 'belt and Road Forum' in May, India boycotted
 donon deshon ke bayaan main bharat kii ore se vyakt kii gai sthiti ko lagbhag shabdashah doharaaya gaya tha
 From Delhi's point of view, a strong message was given that India is not alone in its concerns about the 'one Belt, One Road' (OBOR) scheme
 teenon deshon ne 'saarvbhaumik rup se maan' antarrashtriya niyamon, uchit aarthik sahyog or samprabhutaa va kshetreey ekta ke prati 'sammaan' ke aadhaar par ek buniyadi sampark banane kii jarurat par bal diya
 The New York meeting may have given a strong message of growing unity between the three countries, but it is just a beginning
 iskaa kaaryrup main badalanaa ek alag maamla he
 Beijing knows that this unity among the three is not yet so strong
 is saal teenon deshon ke bich malabar nausainik abhyaas, jisamen is saal vimanavahak jahaajon ko bhi shaamil kiya gaya tha, shaayad ek apwaad he
 India and Japan are talking about a plan to build an Asia Africa Growth Corridor as an alternative to OBOR, but it remains to be seen how successful this plan is in view of the turtle movement that India has carried on till now
 iske alaava trump ko ek ke baad ek gharelu samasyaon kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he, jisase asia main america ke mitra deshon ke saamne anishchay kii sthiti he or duusari taraf ve china kii aarthik kaksha main aate ja rahe hai
 Beijing has responded with great caution so far
 china ke videsh mantralay kii pravaktaa hua chuniing ne china ke nazariye ko doharaaya ki ''kshetreey desh gathbandhan kii bajaae bhagidaari banaate hai
 Referring to the indo-japanese joint statement, Hua also said that "I have not even found mention of the word" China "in the statement
 lekin lagata he japani or bhartiya media is bayaan main china ke sambhavit 'bhram' ko lekar zyada phikrmand hai
 i think the media is making too much sense of the statement or it is like media speculation that both Japan and India have a hidden agenda
 ' US President Barack Obama is returning to Washington from Hawaii, leaving the big day off in the midst of a need to quickly find a way out for the US economy standing under a mountain of fiscal imbalance

 There has been a new twist in the much talked about Gaya Roadrage case of Bihar
 is maamle ke sabhi paanchon gavaah apane bayaan se palat gaye hai
 After this it seems that the 17-year-old Aditya Sachdeva who died in this case was not killed by anyone
 gavaahon ke palat jane se yah sawaal uthanaa laazmi bhi he
 Because in the last 15 days all the main witnesses in this case have turned away from their first statement in turn
 jisase yah maamla behad kamjor ho chukaa he
 Now a big question is whether Aditya Sachdeva will be able to get justice? Actually, in the month of May this year, 17-year-old Aditya Sachdeva was returning from a Swift car after celebrating a birthday party with her four other friends
 isi dauraan unki gaadi ke peeche aa rahe esayuvi landrovar gaadi main savaar rocky yadav ne paas maanga tha or paas nahin die jane par aage jaakar rocky yadav ne aditya sachdeva or unke doston kii gaadi rukvaai thi or aditya sachdeva ko goli markar uski hatya kar di thi
 Aditya's four friends Ayush Aggarwal, Ankit, Naseer and Kaifi had made their statements before the magistrate under section 164 after the incident
 bayaan main unhone kaha tha ki unke dost aditya kii hatya rocky yadav ne kii he
 He is the son of Bahubali mafia don Bindeshwar Yadav of Gaya and Manorama Devi, a legislative councilor of Janata Dal United
 lekin pichley 15 dinon main aditya kii chaaron dost ek-ek kar apane pehle ke bayaan se mukar gaye or ghatana main aditya sachdeva ko goli maarane vaala shaks rocky yadav tha yaa nahin isko lekar pahchaan karne main asamarthta jataai he
 The four friends say because it was evening and dark when the incident took place
 isliye unhone saaf taur par nahin dekha ki aakhir aditya ko goli kisne maari
 After Aditya's four friends turned away from his statement, Aditya's parents were quite shocked
 unhen is baat kaa bharosa nahin ho rahaa he ki aakhir unke bete ko kabhi nahin milegaa bhi ki nahin
 Aditya Sachdeva's mother Chand Sachdeva says that he does not understand what the matter is going on
 aditya ke chaaron doston ke apane bayaan se mukar jane ke baad ve sirf nyaaypalika se ummid kar rahe hai
 In this whole case, not only the four friends of Aditya have turned back from the statement, but also the soldier named Sunil Kumar who was a witness in this whole case was overturned
 jisane bayaan diya tha ki usne dekha tha kis tareeke se rocky yadav ke pitabindeshwar yadavane apane aaropee bete ko ghatana ke baad bhagane main madad kii thi
 The whole matter has become very weak due to the reversal of the statement of constable Sunil Kumar
 aise main sawaal yah uthta he ki jis tareeke se pichley 15 dinon main paanch gavaah apane bayaan se mukar gaye hai to in tamaam gavaahon ko police ne suraksha pradaan kyon nahin kii thi taaki ve court main sachai bayaan kar saken
 However, the prosecution still believes that the police have enough scientific, forensic and circumstantial evidence to bring Aditya Sachdeva to justice in the entire case

 court ne mritak akhlaaq ke parijanon ke khilaaf darj gohatya maamle main uske bhai jaan mohammad ko chhodkar anya sabhi aropiyon kii giraftaar par roak laga di he

 uske bete danish ko bhi gambhir rup se ghayal kar diya tha
 The case was investigated by filing a case against some locals

 pakistan ke sabase bade shahar karachi main tamaato kii keemat mangalvaar ko 400 rupee kilo kii record oonchai par pahunch gai
 There are several reasons, including the ban on importation of tomatoes, due to which the prices have gone up
 media report main yah jaankaree di gai he
 Pakistani newspaper Dawn News reported that the government of Pakistan had issued a permit to import 4,500 tonnes of tomatoes from Iran last week, but this arrival in the market could not pick up, resulting in continued demand for tomato prices due to rising demand
 Has gone
 report main ek vyapaaree ke hawaale se bataaya gaya he ki iran se 4,500 ton tamaato kaa aayaat karne kaa permit diya gaya tha, lekin isamen se keval 989 ton tamaato hi pakistan pahunch paaya
 Let me tell you, people in Karachi got a shock last week when the price of tomato increased from Rs 300 per kg to Rs 400 per kg on Wednesday
 is varsh tamaato kii paidaavaar kam rahane kii vajah se daam chadhe hai
 One trader said, "currently tomatoes from Iran and Swat are being sold in Karachi and there is a huge shortage, due to which the prices have skyrocketed

 Madhuri Dixit, Hindi cinema has such a name whose millions of smiles are crazy
 agar maadhuri dance kar den to karodon log yahi kehete hai
 
 
 killed
 maadhuri ke isi gres ko dikhaakar film kalank ko hit karaane kii koshish karan johar or diarector abhishek varman ne kii
 But that magic of Madhuri was seen breaking in stigma
 kalank main maadhuri dikshit ko do gaanon main jagah di gai
 In the first song Ghar More Pardesiya, she was shown alongside Aaliya
 gane kii relies se pehle darshakon ko laga donon kii jugalbandi dekhne ko milegi
 But throughout the song, Aaliya showed the classical dance skills
 maadhuri ke thirakane kaa intjaar kar rahe darshakon ko puure gane main mahaj unhen dekhakar hi aah bharani padi
 Although Madhuri's get-up in this song, it definitely felt that the makers worked fiercely on the designer lehengas, but the grace of Madhuri's lehenga was missing in front of Aaliya's lehenga
 maadhuri ke lahange main wo baat nahin he jo chandramukhi ke lahange main najar ai thi
 While Aaliya's lehenga looks beautiful in the stigma, Madhuri's lehenga looks faded
 maadhuri ke hair style par najar daalen to yun lagata he mekars kisi sasti dukaan par ja tike
 Madhuri's look in the entire song was finished by the actress's class

 Before the release of this song, Madhuri said in many interviews that the song was 'killed' by Mere Devdas
 
 
 ' gane se tulana nahin karen
 Madhuri's fans also accepted this, because if Madhuri does anything, he will make it wonderful
 aakhirkaar kalank kaa tabah ho gaye gaanaa relies hua
 There were expectations from this song, which were touching the sky
 yahi laga ki ek baar phir maadhuri kii adaaen, khubasurat hansi puri mehfil ko apane naam kar legi
 But here too the fans could just say this
 
 
 tabah ho gaye
 Tainted by stigma
 
 
 gane main maadhuri ne dance to kiya lekin puure gane ko dekhakar laga maadhuri kii aatma gaayab he, jaise kisi mashin ko clasical gane par reharsal karaayaa gaya he
 So far, where the eyes meet
 
 
 kii chulabuli maadhuri, ham aapke hai koun kii nisha jo dhik taana karti he, devdas kii chandramukhi, jisaki adaaon ke fain hai
 That magic was missing
 bas yun laga jaise, naarangi lahanga pahanakar, saj-dhajkar jo dance kar rahi he wo maadhuri kii hamshakl he
 Admittedly it was a sad song, but despite Madhuri's presence, neither ah nor wow
 gane main wo dard nahin tha jo gane ke alphaaj bataa rahe the
 Madhuri did not have the pain in her eyes that could tell that someone is narrating the pain of her destruction

 kahin uske kadam thirakane lage to bas film ko ek gaanaa hi hit kara de
 But all these things disappeared in Kalank's song
 puure gane main bas najar aayaa, maadhuri kaa thakaa hua, umradraj cheharaa
 a face that was missing the laugh, whose world is crazy

 Shreyas Iyer was recently given a chance at number-5 in odis on the Windies tour which he used with both hands and scored two half-centuries
 number-5 par acchhee ballebaaji ke dam par ayyar ne number-4 ke liye bhi apana daawa majboot kiya he
 Lokesh Rahul, however, is in different form in the three formats of the game
 kharaab form ke kaaran rahul ko test team main apni jagah ganvaani padi he
 Ganguly has written in his column in the English newspaper Times of India, 'rohit and Shikhar Dhawan are staying as a saluting pair, so Rahul will have to come down
 test main vah apni jagah ganvaa chuke hai or simit overon main ayyar tathaa pandey unhen pareshaan karenge
 The former captain wrote, "iyer has got a place in T20 due to his great performance in odis against West Indies

 film main vah acid cerviver lakshmi agarwal kii bhoomika main najar aaengi
 In this film, not only in the lead role, she is also going to step into production
 iske alaava deepika sports-drama film 83 main najar aaengi
 The film will see Ranveer Singh in the role of former cricketer Kapil Dev
 film kaa nirdesan kabir khan kar rahe hai
 The story of the film 83 will narrate the story of the 1983 World Cup won by the Indian cricket team
 yah ek multistarar film he jisamen ranvir or deepika ke alaava hardi sandhu, pankaj treepathi, saaqib saleem, taahir raaj bhasin, chiraag patil, jatin sarna jaise stars najar aaenge
 On the call of Narendra Modi, Pakistan's wazir-e-azam Nawaz Sharif increased the dignity of the occasion by attending his swearing-in ceremony
 unhone maukey kii najaakat ko dhyaan main rakhkar sanyukt raashtra ke prastaav yaa sharmasaar karne vaali siyaasi bayaanbaji se parhez kiya
 But India's Foreign Secretary Sujata Singh did not show such courtesy
 unhone mumbai aatanki hamale kaa zikr kiya or uski sajeesh ke aaropee saat pakistaniyon ke khilaaf mukademe main teji laane kii maang kii
 Sharif risked sharp criticism on the domestic front by not raising the controversial issue of "kashmir" despite his political vendetta like this
 agar nattejey aise hi ekatarfa hone the to sabase pehla sawaal to yah he ki kya navaj ko nyauta manjuur karnaa chahie tha?har vakt nuktachini karne vaale to tauba, tauba kah rahe haih sharif nasamajhi main kadam uthaa baithe or narendra modi ne chaturaai se apane jaal main fansaa liya
 Sharif expresses his intention to move forward and emphasizes the importance of mutual relations between business and people, but Modi, as usual, used the old tone of terms related to terrorism
 sharif ne to chalaang bhar lee lekin modi ek kadam bhi aage nahin bade
 Is this the real picture? What happened behind the scenes? How are the public statements on both sides different from the perspective of the ground reality that emerged in the hour-long conversation? Of course, South Block's official press release does not present the full picture
 sharif pehle din se hi spasht kar chuke the ki unhen hindustan ke navnirvaachit pradhanmantri ke shapath grahan main shirkat karne kaa nyauta manjuur karnaa he
 He deliberately allowed it to be delayed for a while to avoid controversy
 varisht patrkaar najam sethi ke mutabik, sharif ne fouj se ijaajat nahin maangi, bas use jaankaree bhar di
 He did take a briefing from the State Department, but did not talk to ISI or anyone else
 rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar sartaaj ajij or videsh vibhaag ne unhen salaah di thi ki shapath grahan samaaroh or raatri bhoj main shirkat karen or usee din laut aaen, dwipaksheeya baatcheet main shaamil na hon
 Sharif knew that the advice of the army was also included in this advice
 aalaa hukmaranon ko koi dikkat nahin thi, basharte ve dotarafa baatcheet main apni ore se koi thos pahal na karen
 They wanted it to be done later
 jab sharif ne brif dekha to ve jaan gaye ki iskaa matlab kya he
 The chief of the army, General Rahil Sharif, met on Sunday with Punjab Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif to discuss these issues
 general ne pradhanmantri ke bhai se kaha ki miyaan sahab ne to hamase brif liya nahin he, isliye ham aapako apni raay se rou-ba-rou kara dete hai
 The Chief Minister was told that the army is in support of the Prime Minister to move slowly on the front of India
 hukmaranon ke saaf sandesh ke baavjood pradhanmantri sharif ne apni sharton par aage badaae kaa faisla kiya
 Sethi says, "they have stuck their necks by insisting on a negotiated conversation and if Hindustani continues to insist on the conditions, the possible magic of the occasion will go in vain
" ’’patrkaar ejaj haidar kaa maananaa he ki modi ne chaturaai dikhaai, sharif ko aavbhagat main fansaaya or baad main apane tevar dikhaa die
 He says, "sharif got caught in it and got caught because he really wanted to turn this opportunity into a way forward
" lekin yah galatfahami thi
 Look at the contradiction: Modi kept the demand and tried to move the dialogue process almost to the situation before the Thimphu round, while Sharif postponed meeting the leaders of the All Party Hurriyat Conference thinking that the atmosphere would not deteriorate Go ’’ haidar kaa maananaa he ki aisa kuch nahin hua hota, agar sharif ne nayaa itihaas banane ke chakkar main khud na jaakar neshnal assembly ke spikar ko bhej diya hota
 Others believe that Sharif has given a strong message to military rulers and Pakistan-based jihadi groups by not mentioning Kashmir and meeting Kashmiri separatists in his press conference
 hindustan main modi kii jeet ke fouran baad kashmiri algaavvaadiyon se mulaakaat siyaasi taur par galat kadam hoti
 Daily Times columnist Drs
 mohammad taki ne kaha, ‘‘miyaan sahab ne shaayad mahasoos kiya ki mulk ke suraksha nizaam kii badaulat pakistan kii hindustan or baaki duniya main saakh maamuli hi rah gai he isliye kam-se-kam ek nai pahal ke is maukey ko jaaya nahin hone dena chahie
 "seeing all these things, this meeting seems like a minor initiative, not a big diplomatic leap
" andruni sutron ke mutabik, sharif ne dwipaksheeya baatcheet main hindustan ke pradhanmantri se kaha ki baatcheet par shart thopane yaa puraani baton ko dohraane yaa aarope-pratyarope kii koi tuk nahin he
 Both countries should look towards the future and think about removing roadblocks
 sharif ne modi se kaha ki unhone congress sarkaar ko berok-tok bazaar tak pahunch (endieme)-menen (sabase pasandida desh) ke liye nayaa naam-kaa darja nahin diya taaki chunaav main bijepi ke khilaaf iskaa beja istemaal na kiya ja sake
 Sharif also spoke to Siachen about the removal of the army, making visas easier and playing cricket
 sabase ahm baat yah ki unhone kashmir par baatcheet ke vyapak daayaron ko kholane kii bhi baat kii
 Mian sahab's diplomatic thinking seems correct
 nai sambhaavnaaon ke maukey par puraane raag alaapne se sharif kii aman kii koshishon main bakheda khadaa ho saktaa tha
 Of course, Sharif will be the target of religious and political factions in the country, which add to the tone of the army because it is necessary for their survival and not for Pakistan to maintain a confrontation with India

 Taki says, "mian saheb would have been rightly advised to look after him, because for those who are trying every minute to create a frenzy every minute in Pakistan, do something else in Kargil, Mumbai or October 11, 1999
 Is not difficult
 unke liye to morche apane hi ghar main khule hai, na ki dilli main
 "imtiaz Alam, secretary general of the South Asian Free Media Association, applauds Sharif's decision to visit India
" ve kehete hai, ‘‘yah sadbhaavna yatra thi
 Sharif was repeatedly trying to carry forward the 1999 consent, citing the Lahore Declaration and his rapport with Vajpayee
 ’’ farvari, 1999 main hindustan ke pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi donon deshon ke bich shuru hui bas par savaar hokar pakistan pahunch gaye the
 Their visit was seen as a new initiative to improve relations after the nuclear tests of India and Pakistan
 sharif or vaajapeyi ne dwipaksheeya samjhauta ‘‘lahore ghoshnaa’’ par dastakhat kiye, jis par hindustan or pakistan kii sansad ne apni muhar lagaai
 The army was not happy with the efforts of the Sharif government and they tried to neutralize these efforts through the Kargil war
 is harakat se sharif or fouj ke mukhiya general parvej musharraf ke bich tanaav bad gaya
 This not only made Aman's efforts useless, but in October 1999, the Sharif government farewell in a military coup
 apane haalia dilli daure main sharif ne vaajapeyi se milane unke ghar jaakar ek baar phir hindustan ke saath aman kaayam karne ke apane iraade ko doharaaya
 He believes that BJP and Modi will carry forward Vajpayee's legacy
 imtiyaaj alam kaa maananaa he ki yah dwipaksheeya baatcheet shuru karne kaa sahi mauka he, lekin lagata he ki dilli abhi aatankwaad par pakistan ke ravaie kaa intjaar karegi
 By inviting the leaders of SAARC countries to his swearing-in ceremony, Modi has emphasized his concerns about the region, and Sharif maintains the same view
 alam kehete hai, ‘‘halaat kii maang he ki baatcheet donon taraf ke buniyadi masalon kii bandhak nahin banani chahie
 It remains to be seen whether Modi goes beyond his staunch or warlike image or remains entangled in the proxy war of Afghanistan
 ’’ pakistan main kaiyon ko is baat kii ashanka he ki modi afghanistan ke maamle main zyada aakraamak rukh apanaayenge
 Political commentator Omar Javed believes that the two leaders realize each other's domestic compulsions
 duusare saarc deshon ke netaaon ke saath nyauta manjuur karke sharif ne hindustan kii kuch had tak badi kshetreey haisiyat or chaahe apane hiton main hi sahi, rishte sudhaarney kii jarurat ko pahachaanaa he
 Their own interest is to promote economic progress and military patronage in their country
 javed kii raay main sharif or unki party ke netaaon kaa fouj or lashkare taiyaba jaisi kattar takaton ke hamalavar rukh se alag ravaiya ikhtiyaar karnaa nai ummid jagaata he
 He says, "business will be at the center of both understanding of growth and if Indian states like Gujarat can get an edge in manufacturing, then Punjab in Pakistan can also benefit because the market there is full of consumers
" ’’unka yah bhi maananaa he ki sharif or modi, donon kaa mul janaadhar ek jaisaa he or vah he mahatvakankshi madhyavarg or vyapaar gharaane
 That is why they realize the need for a certain kind of economic growth
 kaarobaar ke maamle main ek samjhauta or kaaryayojna pehle se taiyaar he, jiskaa pakistan ko elaan karnaa hi baaki he
 He is waiting for a good signal from Narendra Modi
 navaj sharif or modi, donon taqatvar pradhanmantri hai, lekin abhi yah dekhnaa baaki he ki ve apane vaadon ko puraa kar pate hai yaa nahin

 But when the Indian Army was ready on 11 January, not only the Pakistani army was mobilized but Islamabad was also ready to guarantee that it would end all terrorist activities from its land
 vah samay biit gaya
 Now the attack of 26 November created a sense of confusion

 India has an edge over Pakistan in quality and numbers in the Air Force and Navy, but their land forces are almost at par

 The problems of the Indian Army are in all three areas - organization, arms and equipment and principles and political direction
 1980 ke dashak ke shuru main teenon senaaon ke liye rajnatik nirdesh yah tha ki pakistan ke saath 'nishedhaatmak pratirodh' or china ke saath 'rakshaatmak pratirodh' kaa siddhant apanaaya jaae
 This meant that the military should have the capability to aggressively attack Pakistan, but in China's case the policy was that it should have a defensive power that would prevent Beijing from military action
