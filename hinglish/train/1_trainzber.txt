 akram ne kaha, ‘‘bharat ko harbhajan kii kami khal rahi he
 In pitches that have bounce and grass, the spinner's job is to curb runs
 use aisi pichon par bahut adhik turn hasil karne ke bare main nahin sochna chahie
 '' Comments unhone kaha, ‘‘kam se kam ballebaajon ko ooncha shot khilne ke liye lalachaao

 bharat-china rishton ko behatar banane main pradhanmantri narendra modi america ke purv raashtrapati richard nicksan jaise rajaneta sabit ho sakate hai
 a leading Chinese English newspaper wrote this talk on Friday
 akhbaar ne pradhanmantrinarendra modi kii ranneetik samjaur vyavhaar kushalta kii tarif kii he
 However, the newspaper has also cautioned that the US and Japan should not take advantage of India to pressure China
 isi akhbaar ne kii thi modi kii aalochaneekhbaar global times ne shuukravaar ko apane sampadakeey aalekh main kaha he, 'modi ko ranneetik samaj vaala netaa mana jaataa he

 But this diplomatic activity of last year shows that they are adopting practicality and they do not have the foresight

 ' aalekh main haalanki yah ashanka jataai gai he ki duusare desh china par dabaav banane main bharat kaa upyog kar sakate hai

 "it says," If they cannot be resolved soon, then both sides should follow the code of conduct already approved
 ' aalekh main kaha gaya he ki china ke kaaryakramon ko lekar bharat kaa rukh spasht nahin he
 According to the article 'india does not consider China a unanimous leader', 'india does not have a clear stand on China's One Belt One Road program

 The NDA government today pushed forward the business in the House and tried to carry out last week's incomplete discussion on the goals of sustainable development under Rule 193, after which discussion on IPL dispute was listed in the House under this rule
 lekin congressi sadasyon ne niyam 193 ke tahat ipel vivaad par bhaajapa ke ek sadsy ke prastaav par charchaa karaae jane kaa kadaa virodh kiya or lalit modi or vyampan par uskaa pehle se chalaa aa rahaa virodh pradarshan or narebaaji jor pakad gai
 Ignoring the opposition's opposition, Vice President m Thambidurai sought to carry on the work, but some Congress members tore the paper and hurled towards him, prompting the Vice President to immediately suspend the proceedings
 hangaame ke bich ek baar to sadan main yah sthiti ban gai ki jal sansaadhan mantri uma bharti, bhaajapa sadsy jagadambika paal, kiran kher tathaa kuch anya sadsy bhi congressi sadasyon ke vyavhaar ke virodh main asana ke samaksh aa gaye
 Due to the chaos in the house, the proceedings were adjourned for the day by Speaker Sumitra Mahajan at about four o'clock

 Outraged by the behavior of the members, the chairman said, 'I am deeply saddened by the manner in which you (congress members) have dealt with the seat

 ' Earlier in the day, Parliamentary Affairs Minister m Venkaiah Naidu demanded the posture to take action against members of Congress and some other parties in front of the posture and continue to raise slogans, on which Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan said that 40 People together cannot kill more than 440 members and such conduct is murder of democracy

 Due to this uproar, the proceedings of the House were adjourned for the day for the third time at around 4 pm after the adjournment of the House twice

 But the Congress members strongly opposed the discussion on the proposal of a member of the BJP on the IPL dispute under Rule 193, and his pre-existing protests and sloganeering on Lalit Modi and Vyapam gained momentum
 vipaksh ke virodh kii andekhi karte hue upaadhyaksh em thambidurai ne kaamkaaj aage badhanaa chaha, lekin kuch congressi sadasyon ne kaagaj faad kar unki ore oochaal die jiske chalate upaadhyaksh ne kaarywahi turat phurat sthagit kar di

 It would have been better if i had written the common man of this country, my dear PM
 magar maaf kiijie
 Love is not coming from anywhere

 Mr
 Singh, this is a speaking country and in the last few years its discomfort has increased so much that the lyrics have turned into noise
 har hafte kaa sabji kaa kharch jab badha to ham vahiin mandi main hi bhinbhinane lage
 When engaged in the line of petrol pump, looking at the meter, you were watching your sugar report as if
 balaatkaar ke mudde par ham yuva sadakon par utre, tab sarkaar ne hamaara swaagat laathiyon or pani kii bauchhaar se kiya
 But we spoke, spoke continuously and being the constitutional head of the country, you hoped that you would also speak
 hamaare sulagate sawaalon kaa jawaab denge
 But no, you remained silent for most of the time and when it was asked a question
 to aap bole, haa main bolta hum
 But on the party forum
 pradhanmantri ji, aap congress party ke nahin, is desh ke mukhiya hai
 It would be better if the country listens to you, not a selective representative of a particular family or party
 bijepi netaa or purv vitt mantri yashavanth sinha kaa aapke bare main kaha ek jumala ab desh main khub doharaaya jaataa he, manmohan singh ek over rated iconmist hai or under rated politisian
 i am sorry that your political understanding looked very crude
 jab aapse koyala aavanton or 2ji spectrum main hue ghotaalon par sawaal puche gaye, to aapkaa jawaab tha, ye sab upie 1 main hua or uske baad hue chunaavon main janata ne ham par yakeen dikhaaya
 So are you saying that these scams or disturbances got the mandate stamped
 sab jaij ho gaya
 Is getting the majority a condition of making everything white
 tab to phir aapako aaj ke bhaashan main narendra modi par bhi sawaal nahin uthaanaa chahie tha
 Because he too has got the mandate three times after the 2002 Gujarat riots
 kitna bada virodhabhas tha aapaki daleelon main!aapako lagata he ki media, sieji or vipaksh ne nirmam or ataarkik ravaiya apanaaya he aapke moolyankan main
 You think historians will evaluate you more kindly
 mujhe garv ho rahaa he ye kehete hue ki aapako galat lagata he
 We the youth of this country are sometimes learning to express their discomfort through Twitter, sometimes Facebook, sometimes blog or sometimes ballot
 ham is desh kaa itihaas likhenge or puri nirmamata se yah baat likhenge ki jab desh 21veen sadi ke sabase nirnaayak vakt main tha, tab aapane chuppi ke saath kabhi gathbandhan ke dharm to kabhi gandhi parivaar ke marm ke saamne sarender kar diya
 Manmohan ji, history is not merciless and you also know this
 jaraa yaad kariye ki aapako rashtriya falak par chamakaane vaale pivi narsimharav kaa itihaas or unke saath aapaki party kaa suluk
 It is quite possible that in the 2014 elections, your government is to be blamed for those results when the Congress is molasses
 jahaan khari-khari bolne kii baat thi, masalan virbhadra singh par lage aarope, aapane sapaat jawaab diya ki abhi mujhe jetali kii chitthee par dimag lagane kaa vakt nahin mila
 So i hope you will get time soon
 aaj aapaki chaukasee narendra modi ko gherne par rahi, jo ki party line ke lihaaj se sahi bhi he
 But the country wanted similar cautious but accurate comments on issues other than Modi
 press conference main kabhi to aap bole ki gathbandhan kii majaburiyon ke chalate jo best ho saktaa tha, maine kiya
 Sometimes i said that we showed it by running a coalition government
 to tay kar lijie ki gathbandhan se napha hua ki nuksaan
 You have been a professor, you know how much we young students are annoyed with round-the-clock talk
 baaten bahut hai, magar aap kam bolne vaale hai isliye ham bhi kuch kam shabdon main hi apni takalif bataa rahe hai
 As the Prime Minister, you probably would have liked to have said and accepted some truth in your last press conference

 Addressing the press conference, Satyanarayana said that the UPA government is actively involved in this matter and is trying to build consensus by consulting with political parties of all regions

 (from input language) (input bhashaa se) As the voting date for the Gujarat assembly elections draws closer, the Congress is shocked
 gujarat kii yuva tikdi main se pehle hardik patel to ab jignesh mewaani ne congress ko gachha de diya he
 Dalit leader Jignesh Mevani has refused to join hands with any party, including the Congress
 unhone kaha ki in chunaavon main wo kisi party ko jwoin nahin karenge
 This statement of Mevani is a big blow for the Congress because the party had dreamed of winning the war of Gujarat with the help of hardik-mevani and Alpesh Thakor
 gauratlab he ki alpesh ne vidhivat rup se congress kii sadsyta le lee he
 Rahul Gandhi has taken the front to break the exile of power in Gujarat
 chunaav kii tarikhon ke elaan se pehle rahul gandhi ne bada daanv khelaa tha
 The Congress invited OBC leader Alpesh Thakor, Patidar leader Hardik Patel and Dalit leader Jignesh Mewani to come together to fight the elections against BJP
 is nyote ko sweekaar karte hue sabase pehle alpesh thakor ne congress kaa daaman thama
 Hardik Patel's stance among the young trio of Gujarat is not yet clear
 haal hi main unhoneensipi netaaon ke saath mulaakaat kii
 Until a few days ago, it seemed that Hardik would go with the Congress, but at the last moment he gave an ultimatum to the Congress
 unhone patidaar samaaj ko kota dene ke maamle main congress ko pehle 3 november tak kii mohalat di
 Now this date has been extended till 7 November
 congress ne is par abhi chuppi sadhi hui he
 Amidst Hardik's dilemma, Jignesh Mevani, now a Dalit face in Gujarat, has flatly refused to support the Congress
 ek samay jignesh ko saath jodne ke liye congress ne apane saare ghode khol die the
 Recently, Jignesh Mevani was in Delhi, it was believed that he would meet Rahul Gandhi and join Congress, but he did not meet
 ab aaj unhone apni sthiti puri tarah saaf kar di he
 Jignesh Mevani, identified with the Dalit movement, suddenly came into the limelight when he administered the oath of not taking dead animals and scavenging together to 20,000 Dalits in the 'azadi Cooch Movement' after the Una incident in Veraval
 jignesh ne us samay kaha tha- 'is muhim main ham har shahar, gali or gaanv main jaakar bahujan samaaj ke logon ko shapath dilaa rahe hai ki ve log apni puraani varna vyavastha par aadhaarit pesha choden or baba sahib ambedkar ke bataae raste par chalakar shikshit bane or apane paanv par khadey hon'
 Jignesh's political strength, the Congress is being considered a major setback due to the absence of Jignesh, Gujarat has around 7 per cent Dalit voters and Dalits number 15 per cent in the country
 iske alaava gujarat main adivasee matadaata 12 fisadi he
 Jignesh worked to unite the dalits and tribals of the state
 jignesh mewaani yuva or tej-tarraar hai
 Jignesh could play an important role in bringing back the Dalit votes to the Congress, not just in Gujarat but also in the country
 maujuuda daur main congress dalit yuva chehron kii kami se jujh rahi he
 In such a situation, the Congress had kept hopes from Jignesh who had made an identity through Una movement
 lekin jignesh ne saaf inkaar karke congress ke saare armaanon par pani pher diya he

 input - bhashaa The special session of the Delhi Legislative Assembly began on Thursday, and as soon as the house was started at four and a half hours after the adjournment, postponement due to the uproar, both Congress and BJP got into a ruckus
 achaanak congress ke vidhayak asif mohammad daudte hue spikar kii kursi ke paas aae or vahaan pade kaagazat uthaakar faad daale, But Josh was still left
 ab wo daudkar mukhyamantri aravind kejariwal ke paas gaye, vahaan unako mike nazar aae to unhone wo bhi tod daale
 Congress President Arvinder Singh Lovely and MLA Hasan Ahmed both went to the Speaker's chair and started shouting slogans
 jaise hi spikar kuch bolnaa chaahate, ye donon unka mike khinch lete the
 Congress MLA Jaikishan gave ginger to Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, BJP MLA RP Singh gave bangles to Law Minister Somnath Bharti
 jahaan tak yaad he, aisa shaayad pehali baar ho rahaa tha ki ye wo vidhansabha nahin lag rahi thi
 It was being said from both Congress and BJP that we are 40
 40 kaa matlab bijepi 32 or congress 8 or spikar ko hamaari baat manani hogi
 The demand was to bring a "call attention motion" on the issue of Somnath Bharti
 somnath bharti ko barkhaast kiya jaae
 Coming out, Congress President Arvinder Singh Lovely said that we have apologized for the behavior of our mlas
 aaj ke hangaame ke "superstar" rahe congress ke vidhayak asif mohammad ne kaha, kyonki spikar unki baat nahin sun rahe the, isliye unhone aisa kiya or unke paas koi rasta nahin tha
 But, he did not stop to say that we will continue the uproar tomorrow
 abhi tak kii puri kahani hadeline se mail nahin kha rahi na? This story is told because it seems that the Congress strategy is to create a ruckus and raise the issue of Somnath Bharti or janalokapal bill par khadey hue dharmsankat ko taalane kii koshish karo
 BJP has to accept this policy anyway, so it is not a problem to appear with Congress on this issue
 ab sawaal ye he ki shuukravaar ko yani vailemtine de par kya hoga? Arvind Kejriwal intends to present Jan Lokpal in the Legislative Assembly, but if the government is stopped even before the bill is put on the table? yani agar uparajyapal ki taraf se koi sandesh aa gaya jo bill ko teble hone se roak de to? aisi surat main mukhyamantri bill pesh karne ke liye aage badhenge or agar bill pesh karne ke liye voting hui to kya hoga? In such a case, the test will be for the Congress and the BJP because if the bill is not introduced then what will be the discussion? And when there is no discussion, who will pass? aise surat main shuukravaar ko hi aravind kejariwal istifa de sakate hai or dilli ki sarkaar gir jaaegi
 The test here is not of the Aam Aadmi Party government but of the congress-bjp
 kyonki ye sarkaar bani nahin banavaai gai he And the reasons for which this government was formed may not be fulfilled yet
 aise kya congress-bijepi donon ye kejariwal sarkaar kaa girnaa bardaashat kar sakate hai? kya bijepi aravind kejariwal ko dilli se free karnaa jhel sakati he? kya congress kejariwal sarkaar ke virodh main jaakar apni sadabahaar virdohi bijepi ke saath dikh sakati he? or kya donon kejariwal ke is hamale ke liye taiyaar honge ki ''bhrashtachar rokane ke liye ek sakht kaanoon laane ke unki sarkaar giraayi gai? So i said whether Kejriwal will resign on Valentine's Day, congress-bjp's test
 Let's find out on Friday whether Kejriwal will be free for the 2014 Lok Sabha elections or to further the party's agenda as the Chief Minister of Delhi

 He has written- This is the condition of millions of temporary teachers at the college and school level in India
 iske liye minakshi lekhi akele zimmedaar nahin hai, ve sabhi hai jo sarkaar chalaate hai or nitiyaan banaate hai
 Meenakshi ji would have known at the same time that the same system has been in India for many years and if the condition of the teachers is worse, then she would suffer
 bharat main shikshak diwas par mahimamandan ek frad kaarykram he
 The teacher's blood is sucked throughout the year, he has to live with insecurity, one day we are happy to make a card for him that he has a great respect
 netaa naitik shiksha dekar chal detaa he ki shikshak samaaj ke nirmaataa he
 The naive public becomes foolish and happy that what the leader has said
 shiksha mitron kii haalat dekh lee hoti kam se kam
 Even after being educated, the teacher is unemployed and poor
 padhein- prime time intro: kya janata kii qeemat par kamaaya ja rahaa he tel se munaafaa? Referring to 2014 Teachers 'day, Ravish writes: What a spectacle it was on Teachers' Day in the year 2014
 ghanton pehali baar ho rahe us tamaashe par charchaa hui thi
 Give this data that how many full-time appointments have been made in colleges in your government? How many posts are vacant and how many are to be filled? There are several lakh vacancies in schools in India
 hamane iskaa bhi zikr prime time main kiya tha
 Indian mps are saddened by the plight of temporary teachers of American colleges
 yah acchhee baat he
 Do they know how the economic condition of temporary teachers is where their own government is? Where the governments of his rival parties have survived, the same situation is there
 punjab chunaav ke dauraan asthaayee shikshak mili the, aadhi selary milti he, koi saamaajik suraksha nahin, bataa rahe the ki hamaare paas shaadiyon main jane ke liye achche kapade tak nahin

 input- bhashaa The ICC Cricket World Cup 2019 match between India and Sri Lanka will be played at Headingley ground in Leeds from 3pm today
 pehle hi semifinal main doosraa sthaan pakkaa kar chuki bhartiya team srilanka ke khilaaf jeet se points teble main top par pahunch sakati he, basharte australia pehle hi baahar ho chuki dakshin africa ke khilaaf antim match main haar jaae
 So there will be a lot of effort for the top spot and a possible semi-final against New Zealand as it will be difficult to face the dangerous England
 bharat-australia main top par rahane kii jangaustralia abhi 14 ankon ke saath pehle sthaan par he to vahiin bharat 13 ankon ke saath duusare par
 If India wins Sri Lanka then it will have 15 points but if Australia also wins their match then it will have 16 points and will end the league round with first place

 The middle order puzzle for India is still unresolved and it seems that the Indian team management is more dependent on its plan 'A' which is the success of their top order
 shandaar form main rohitup-captain rohit sharma 544 ran ke saath unke sabase safal ballebaaj rahe hai
 During this time he also scored four records with equal number of centuries
 captain kohli ke liye bhi yah world cap acha rahaa he, haalanki unke str ke hisaab se itnaa behtareen nahin rahaa or unke naam paanch ardhashatak se 400 se zyada ran hai
 Sri Lankan off-spinner Dhananjay De Silva has been quite economical
 dimuth karunaratne apane baayen haath ke spinner milinda serivardhane ko istemaal karnaa chahenge
 But the Indian team can take the match against Sri Lanka a little easier and try some other combinations which include the addition of Ravindra Jadeja
 kedaar jadhav ko mil saktaa he aakhri maukbhi team se jude mayank agarwal ko chhodkar jadeja ekmaatr aise khilaadi hai jinhen world cap main ek bhi match khilne ko nahin mila he lekin srilankai team main baayen haath ke adhik khilaadiyon ko dekhte hue isaki sambhaavna nahin dikh rahi he
 However, this could lead to Kohli and coach Ravi Shastri returning Kedar Jadhav in the middle order as he bowls an off-break ball
 par dinesh karthik ke liye yah thodaa anuchit hoga jinhone bangladesh ke khilaaf pichley match main zyada gendon kaa saamana nahin kiya tha
 Mayank has replaced Vijay Shankar and his best friend Lokesh Rahul has ensured his place in the top order with Rohit scoring two half-centuries
 rohit bhi apane paanchaven shatak kii ummid lagaae honge
 Jasprit Bumrah (14)-led fast bowling attack has the full support of Mohammed Shami (14 wickets) and it would be ideal position to give him some rest before the semi-finals but if the top spot in the points table is at stake, then Kohli has at least one Would like to land on the ground

 com / wden9jp6wg dilli police ke adhikari kehete hai ki pisiar vine kaa koi adhikaar kshetra nahin hota lekin dilli se sate gudgaanv main bilkul iske ulat he
 
 
 Gurgaon PCR van operates according to its region
 darasal, gudgaanv main somvaar ko sheetala mata road par chalate auto se ek ladki ko phenk diya gaya jisamen ladki ko kuch chotein bhi ain
 
 
 Just then, the Congress MLA passing by, as soon as he saw this, got down from the car and helped him by taking care of the victim girl
 vidhayak ne khud hi gudgaanv police control room main phone kiya
 
 
 But for about half an hour, there was no representation from the Gurgaon Police
 aadhe ghante baad vahaan se gudgaanv police kii pisiar vine nambar nau gujri
 
 
 When the MLA wanted to stop him, the policeman sitting in the PCR van said that he was going for some other work
 
 
 ladki ko le jane ke liye duusari pisiar aa rahi he
 The comments yah sara vakya mobile camere main kaid ho gaya or aakhir main pisiar vine nambar nau vahaan se bina maamla jane nikal gaye lekin is puure maamle ne ek baar phir aapkaa saath dene kaa naaraa dene vaali gudgaanv police kii laachaari najar aa rahi he ki us ghayal ladki ko sadak par chhodkar chale gaye
 However, the girl did not make any complaint to the police in the case of throwing the girl from the auto, but the case exposed the Gurgaon Police
 sawaal yah uthta he ki agar yah maamla bhi dilli gangrape jaisaa hota to iskaa jimmedaar koun hota
 In fact, on Monday, a girl was thrown from the auto while walking on Sheetla Mata Road in Gurgaon, in which the girl also suffered some injuries
 
 
 tabhi vahaan se guzar rahe congressi vidhayak ne jaise hi yah dekha vah gaadi se neeche utre or unhone peedit ladki ko sambhalkar uski madad kii
 The MLA himself called the Gurgaon Police Control Room
 
 
 lekin kareeb aadhe ghante tak vahaan gudgaanv police kaa koi numaayinda nahin pahunchaa
 Half an hour later, the Gurgaon Police's PCR van number nine passed from there
 
 
 vidhayak ne use rokna chaha to pisiar vine main baithe pulicekarmi kaa kahana tha ki ve to kisi or kaam se ja rahe hai
 
 
 a second PCR is coming to take the girl
 tippaniyan All this incident was captured in the mobile camera and finally PCR van number nine went out from there without knowing the matter, but this entire case is once again seen by the helplessness of the Gurgaon police, that slogan of supporting the injured girl Leaving on the road, went away
 haalanki, ladki ko auto se phenkane ke maamle main peedita ladki ne police main kisi prakaar kii shikaayat nahin kii lekin is maamle ne gudgaanv police kii pole khol di
 The question arises that if this case too was like Delhi gang rape then who would be responsible for it
 yah sara vakya mobile camere main kaid ho gaya or aakhir main pisiar vine nambar nau vahaan se bina maamla jane nikal gaye lekin is puure maamle ne ek baar phir aapkaa saath dene kaa naaraa dene vaali gudgaanv police kii laachaari najar aa rahi he ki us ghayal ladki ko sadak par chhodkar chale gaye
 However, the girl did not make any complaint to the police in the case of throwing the girl from the auto, but the case exposed the Gurgaon Police
 sawaal yah uthta he ki agar yah maamla bhi dilli gangrape jaisaa hota to iskaa jimmedaar koun hota

 The earthquake killed 9,000 people and destroyed six million structures in the area
 america ke newada vishvavidhyalay ke steve vesnoski 20 saal se himalayan frontal folt kaa adhyayan kar rahe hai
 Steve said that he had carried out several studies of earthquake remnants around Kathmando in the past year, digging, studying soils and earthquake-sensitive areas that appear to be older than 2000 years
 unhone kaha, 'aitihaasik recordon ke saath, yah prathit hota he ki ye samvedansheel folt gorkha bukamp se bhi zyada bada bukamp laa sakate hai'

 We are talking about gifts
 agar aap apni saathi ko gift dena chaahate he, to vah bhi acchhee tarah se plan kiye hue hone chahie
 So let's plan a journey of friends' gifts
 
 
 do hafton menis dauraan koi tohfa na den
 When you make them your friend and they also start giving importance to the friend, do not give them any gift in the first 2 weeks
 kyonki yah bahut jaldbaaji hogi
 Yes, you can let them know about their future plans
 lekin puri baat na bataaen
 Tell them that you have a wonderful surprise for them in the coming times
 chaar hafton mendosti ko jab puure 4 saptaah biit chalem hon, to bhi baari bharkam tohfa kharidne kii jaldbaaji na karen
 4 weeks means one month, in such a long time, the foundation of trust is put
 is antaraal ke baad agar aap unhen manhagaa yaa bada tohfa denge, to shaayad unhen ajeeb lage
 So it is a better option to take them to dinner after 4 weeks
 haa, chahen to dinar ke baad koi chota sa gift aap unhen de sakate he
 In six weeks, if the friend has been 6 weeks and both of you are together as before, then you have to decide whether you are in love
 agar iskaa jawaab haa main miltaa he, to janaab aap jo chahen unhen tohfe main dene ke liye aaazaad hai
 But if the answer is no, then it is better to follow the fourth week plan

 In a major setback to the government, the Supreme Court appointed senior advocate KK Venugopal as amicus curiae (court-supporting lawyer) in the 2G case
 sarvocch nyaayalay ne kendriya jaanch beuro (sibiai) or pravartan nideshaalay (idi) ko aadesh diya ki maamle se sambhddha tamaam jaankariyaan or dastavej venugopal ko saunpe jaaen
 The decision to appoint Venugopal as amicus curiae was taken by the bench of Chief Justice HL Dattu and Judge Arun Mishra
 yah faisla isliye mahatvapurn he kyonki venugopal 2-ji maamle main pehle din se sibiai or idi kii madad kar rahe the
 They were later removed saying that a 'conflict of interest' was taking place
 is baat ko bataate hue ki maamle kii sunwaayee aakhri daur main he, dattu ne venugopal se kaha, "ham aapako apane saath bataur emicas curi chaahate hai
 " mukhya nyaayadhish ne venugopal ko sammanit varisht vakil bataaya or kaha ki ve venugopal se prarthana kar rahe hai ki vah "2ji maamle main adaalat kii madad jari rakhen
 " venugopal se kehane se pehle mukhya nyaayadhish ne kaha, "mujhe pataa he ki unase (sibiai-idi) se kaise kahana he" ki venugopal apana kaam is maamle main jari rakhenge
 Prashant Bhushan, a lawyer for an NGO, told the court that the ED first withdrew Venugopal's name and then the CBI did the same
 idi ne venugopal ko apana pratinidhitiv karne se tab manaa kar diya tha jab 8 sitambar 2014 ko sarvocch nyaayalay ne idi ko nirdesh diya tha ki rajeshwar singh naam ke ek afasar ko vah bataur up-nideshak apane saath rakhe
 The ED did not want that
 rajeshwar singh par idi kaa rukh vahi nahin tha jo venugopal kaa tha
 For this reason, the Finance Ministry asked the ED to remove Venugopal from the list of his lawyers due to conflict of interest
 tippaniyan In this context, Prashant Bhushan said that angry with the court order on Rajeshwar Singh, ED removed Venugopal
 is par mukhya nyaayadhish ne kaha ki ek 'nyaayik aadesh' ke aadhaar par adaalat ne singh ko idi main lene kii baat kahi thi
 However, the order was opposed by another senior advocate l Nageswara Rao
 kendriya prashasnic nyaayaadhikaran (cat) ne aadesh diya tha ki rajeshwar singh ko idi bataur up nideshak apane yahaan rakhe
 After the ed's protest, Singh took refuge in the Supreme Court
 venugopal ko emicas curi niyukt karne kaa faisla mukhya nyaayadhish echel dattu or nyaayadhish arun mishra kii khandpeeth ne liya
 This decision is important because Venugopal was helping the CBI and ED in the 2-G case from day one
 baad main unhen yah kah kar hataa diya gaya ki 'hiton kaa takaraav' ho rahaa he
 Stating that the case is in the final stages of hearing, Dattu told Venugopal, "we want you as an amicus curiae with us
" " The Chief Justice described Venugopal as a respected senior advocate and said that he was praying to Venugopal to "continue to help the court in the 2G case
" " Before telling Venugopal, the Chief Justice said, "I know how to tell him (CBI-ED)" that Venugopal will continue his work in the case
 ek swayamsevi sanstha ke vakil prashanth bhushan ne adaalat ko bataaya tha ki pehle idi ne venugopal kaa naam waapas liya or phir sibiai ne bhi yahi kaam kiya
 The ED refused to represent Venugopal when the Supreme Court on 8 September 2014 directed the ED to keep an officer named Rajeshwar Singh with him as deputy director
 idi aisa nahin chahta tha
 The ed's stand on Rajeshwar Singh was not the same as Venugopal's

 police par firing kar rahe do badmaashon main se ek badmaash jahaan police kii goli se ghayal ho gaya, vahiin doosraa badmaash faraar hone main safal rahaa
 Police said the injured miscreant has been admitted to the hospital, while the police team is engaged in the investigation of the fugitive miscreant
 police ne bataaya ki giraft main aae badmaash ke paas se ek apache bike, ek tamancha va kuch kaartoos baraamad hue hai
 According to the police, two suspicious bike riders were stopped by the police while checking near Gadi Chaukhandi roundabout in Police Station Phase-3 area of noida on Friday evening
 police ne bike savaaron kaa peechha kiya
 Seeing themselves surrounded, the miscreants opened fire on the police party
 is par police ne javaabi fayirang kii, jisamen sachin naam ke wanted badmaash ko goli lag gai, jabaki dusraa badmaash maukey se faraar hone main kaamyaab rahaa
 Police officials said that the arrested crook Sachin is a resident of Sarai Khasi in Secunderabad and was currently living in Dharmapura area of badlapur police station
 police kaa kahana he kii sachin shaatir kism kaa badmaash he or ek badi lut ke maamle main dilli kii shahdara thana kii police list main wanted aparaadhiyon main shaamil he
 Sachin has also gone to jail in a robbery case in station phase 3 of Noida

 rajya ke himalay parvaton kii haalia bhugolic masping main kaha gaya he ki yahaan aath yaa isse bhi zyada tivrata kaa bukamp aa saktaa he
 According to scientists, the Reasi fault has been under pressure for some time
 isse yah sanket mil rahaa he ki jab vah is dabaav ko chodta he to uske baag aane valabukamp bheeshanho saktaa he, jisaki tivrata aath yaa isse upar ho sakati he
 The lead author of this study, who was a researcher at Oregon State University in the US, said, "we tried to find out how much the fault has been removed in the last ten thousand years
" iske hatane par iske vibhinn hisse kis tarah hile hai? unhone kaha, hamane paaya ki riyasi folt kashmir main padane vaale mukhya sakriy falts main se ek he lekin haalia bhugolic record ke anusaar, bukamp nahin aae hai
 'the fault has not been shifting from its location for a long time,' said Gavilot, who is at the fault, which means that the possibility of a severe earthquake is strong
 sawaal yah nahin he ki kya yah aa rahaa he? yahaan sawaal yah he ki yah kab aa rahaa he
 There has also been evidence of some seismic activity at this fault
 shodhakartaaon ne paaya ki ek bukamp ne folt ke ek hisse ko paanch meter yaa usase kuch adhik tak upar uthaa diya tha
 Probably this happened 4000 years ago
 shodhakartaaon ne kaha ki sthaneey mathon ke likhit record kuch hajaar saal pehle teevr bukamp kaa zikr karte hai
 However, there is not much evidence of how frequent earthquakes occurred at the fault or when it may recur

 Owning an Indian airline is similar
 yah aisa kaarobaar he jisamen aap naakaam nahin ho sakate, basharte aap kaayade se neeche aane ke gur jaanate hon, inaam aapaki jholii main girte rahenge
 When an airline starts working with all gazes, on the very first day, a line of officers of Maldar finance companies is seen in front of its big boss, the owner's room
 moti kamai kii ummid main log big bos kii jholii bhar dene ko aatur dikhte hai
 But after a few months, a sudden noise is heard that the airline went bankrupt
 phir pehle se kahin zyada bankeron kii bheed big bos ke ird-gird jamaa ho jaati he
 This time in the name of patriotism, they are ready to fill the Big Boss bag
 banker mahaj itnaa chaahate hai ki big bos do kism ke saude kar daale-pehla sauda chupake se netaaon ke saath or doosraa cheekh-chillaakar patrakaron ke saath
 There is no need for any logic behind such an exercise in public relations
 iskaa koi matlab na bhi nikle to chalegaa
 Those things are taken care of by businessmen who are not very well known
 lekin jo bhi karen, puraa hallaa machaaen
 The louder the demand for bailout, the more attractive offers will be from the bankers and they will be ready to spend the money of the public's hard earned money so that the endless celebrations in the sky can continue
 jab tak yah sab kuch bilkul theth angreji main chal rahaa hota he, is par koi sawaal nahin uthaata
 Pursuing the capital that has been drowned by new capital is the concrete hallmark of nationalism standing on economic reforms and the true objective of any such bright business: Chit, i won
 pat aap haare
 In such a situation, the question arises, who is the loser? Obviously you and me
 ham saare budhu, jinhone bank main paisa is bharose se daalaa tha ki vah surakshit rahegaa, or vaise bhi bank ke alaava aap paisa rakhenge kahaan
 The airline's big boss and bankers are not foolish enough to spend from their own pocket for their career
 billiyaan apane bacchon ke liye laayaa doodh pikar moti nahin hotin
 They make fun by blowing others' food
 banker bhi jo 'udhari' dete hai, uske peeche unke accountenton kii bejod kalpanaashakti hoti he jisase ve ise sahi tehraate hai
 Apparently, the accountant is smart enough to publicly accept the fact that the board is aware of the mess, long before he takes out his three percent fee
 sweekaarokti kaa naatak karne ke baad board ke chehre latak jate hai or puri vinamrata se uskaa haath ek baar phir aage fail jaataa he
 This is the spark of postmodern capitalism
 baharhaal, jab tak airport se paisa nikal rahaa ho, airline chalaanaa bura dhandha nahin
 There is not too much trouble in it
 bas, niyam kuch alag hote hai, haalanki puraane ho chuke niyamon ko hataakar aap hameshaa nae niyam laa sakate hai
 For example, try an experiment
 kisi car yaa sui kaa order den
 Pay his money phir dukaan par jaaen
 You will get the goods for which you paid
 ab aap puure paise chukaa kar airline tikat khariden
 You will find that there is only one promise in your fist that is wavering in waves of uncertainty
 agar kharaab mausam ke kaaran udaan radd hoti he yaa usamen deree hoti he, to baat samajhi ja sakati he
 But the problem is that the airline management never gives the exact reason
 sirf ek dhaal hoti he unke paas, 'takneekee kaarnon se'
 
 
 i am waiting for someone to reveal some non-technical reason
 kya yah sambhav he ki udghoshika kabhi aisi ghoshnaa bhi kar daale ki udaan isliye radd hui kyonki airline ke big bos hawaii jahaaj main tel bharwane kaa paisa dena bhul gaye, haalanki unke nijee bowing main tel kii koi kami nahin he
 This will not happen, because those who lie, hide their mouth and cheat are the ones who do the same again the next day
 asli khel yah he ki aap bade paimaane par naakaam ho jaaie, jaise lakhon darshakon ke saamne haar jaaie
 Obviously, after such a defeat, you will have to keep bringing emotional boil in between
 phir dekhie, koun nahin aapke kadamon main jhukta
 i know an airline owner who is very polite and runs his business in the same manner
 vah sambhaavnaaon par tike rahete hai, phir nijee taur par yah pakkaa karte hai ki unki company us sambhaavna ko uplabdhi bana le, isse pehle ki anischitata main janaa pade
 Limit yourself and if you have to gossip with a friend, you grab a corner in a coffee shop
 na to pej 3 photographeron ke liye ve party dete hai, na hi kisi akhbaar ko intervyuu dete hai
 It doesn't matter to them whether anyone is recognizing them or not, obviously, i don't want to bother them by printing their names
 unki company bahut maamuli munaafe main chal rahi he jabaki unhen bhi tel kii vahi keemat chukaani padati he jo sab chukaate hai
 He shines like a star in his office
 ve us shrenee ke udyogpati hai jo samajhate hai ki unki pehali vachanabaddhata apane udyog ke prati he, na ki mouj kaatane kii
 Ironically, such a role model is not a paradise on earth
 yah dharti ke bich ek or dharti hi he
 North Korea has long been under economic sanctions, with few countries having diplomatic relations, so how did North Korea easily find nuclear weapons technology? Indeed, Pakistan secretly helped North Korea and helped it develop nuclear weapons
 uttar korea apane purvottar main pungery se parmaanu visphoton ke jariye duniya ko daraata rahaa he
 But time has taken a U-turn, now North Korea is talking about peace
 usne apane parmaanu pareekshan sthal ko nasht karne kii ghoshnaa kii he
 North Korea will foster closer contact and dialogue with neighboring countries and the international community in the future to protect peace and stability on the Korean peninsula and around the world
 pakistan bana uttar korea kaa madadgaarutar korea ab se kuch maheenon pehle tak gaiyr jimmedaar parmaanu kaaryakramon ko jari rakhane kii jid kii vajah se duniya se lagbhag alag-thalag tha
 Significantly, 'terrorism' helped North Korea gain nuclear power
 'aatankistan' yani aatankwaad ko rashtriya niti maanane vaala pakistan hi uttar korea kaa parmaanu kaaryakramon main madadgaar rahaa he
 Under the guise of the missile technology agreement, North Korea and Pakistan had close relations in the 1990s
 iske baad uttar korea or pakistan ke bich liquid fuld belistic missile technology transfar karne ke samjhaute hue
 There was agreement between the two countries that their scientists would work together on missile technology
 uttar korea ne missile viksit karne main pakistan kii madad kii or pakistani vaigyanik abdul kadir khan ke research centre ne uttar korea ko parmaanu hathiyaar viksit karne kii jaankaree di
 This sin of North Korea and Pakistan's stealth-stealth nuclear program was revealed when three people, including a scientist were killed in Islamabad
 2006 main islamabad ke paas kahuta main abdul kadir khan ke research laboretry main dhamaakaa hua tha, vaigyanik samet teen log maut ke munh main samaa gaye the
 North Korea gained nuclear power with the help of Pakistan but during this time it also got help from China
 kyonki tamaam pratibandhon ke baavjood china ke raste vyapaar kii aad main uttar korea tak parmaanu hathiyaar banane ke saamaan aasaani se pahunchate rahe
 However, China has always claimed that it has never provided any other help in North Korea's nuclear program
 khooni itihaas ko bhuulane kii koshish main uttar koriabaharhaal, abuttar koreupane parmaanu pareekshan site ko nasht karne kaa rodmap tay kar chukaa he, haalanki america or dakshin korea pehle hi saaf kar chuke hai ki sabooton ko dekhne ke baad hi uttar korea par lage pratibandh hatenge
 Explain that there was a war between the two Koreas in 1950 in which millions of people were killed
 isi ke baad uttar korea ne pehle aadhunik military takat or baad main parmaanu takat hasil kii
 But in the new era, North Korea seems to be making sincere efforts to forget the bloody history

 dilli ke upmukhyamantri manish sisodiya pramotion nahin chaahate
 Sisodia, who is almost taking over the charge of Chief Minister in place of Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, told the media that he had no desire to become the Chief Minister of Delhi
 dilli sarkaar ke saare mahatvapurn vibhaag manish ke paas hai
 All ministers also report to them
 manish ne mangalvaar ko kaha ki jab upmukhyamantri ke taur par hi kaam badhiya chal rahaa he to mukhyamantri kyon bananaa
 Chief Minister of Portfolio Without Portfolio Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal is unique among the Chief Ministers of all the states of the country in that he does not have a single department despite being the Chief Minister
 ye poochne par ki arvind karte kya hai or kis baat ke mukhyamantri hai,manishkate hai, 'wo puri sarkaar ko maargdarshan dene kaa kaam karte hai
 We also review everyone's work
 samiksha ke aadhaar par nae disha-nirdesh dene kaa kaam bhi arvind karte hai or shashan chalaane kaa sabase acha tarika bhi shaayad yahi he ki mukhyamantri ke paas samiksha, disha-nirdesh dene or maargdarshan kaa hi kaam hona chahie
 We all have to do the rest
 'vidhansabha se bhi nadaarad rahe arvindadilli main mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ke paas koi vibhaag nahin he, baavjood iske kaam itnaa he ki arvind vidhansabha satr ke aakhri din hi pahunch paae
 The Chief Minister, who reached the Assembly on the last day, neither addressed the House nor made any special announcement about Delhi
 aise main saaf jaahir he ki dilli ke 'king'manish sisodiyaahi hai or arvind kejariwal mahaj naam ke mukhyamantri
 Anyway, most of Kejriwal's time is spent preparing for elections in other states
 mukhyamantri kaa sara dhyaan goa-punjab paraam aadmi party punjab or goa ke chunaav main apana puraa dam jhonk rahi he
 Kejriwal, as the party's national convenor, is leading both states prominently
 aise main yahi lagata he ki punjab or goa main satta hasil karne ke liye arvind kejariwal ne dilli kaa sara daaromadar manish sisodiya ke kandhon par chhod diya he
 At least the Chief Minister's presence in the Secretariat and the Legislative Assembly and the Zero Departmental Responsibility with him looks like this
 alam yah he ki aae din arvind kejariwal yaa to gujarat main hote hai yaa punjab main yaa phir goa main
 The question arises that even if they pay attention to Delhi, then how? kuch aisa rahaa he ab tak kaa kariyaravirodhiyon main arvind kejariwal ke bare main yah baat badi mashhoor he ki vah ek jimmedaari milte hi vah agali ke liye pehali jimmedaari ko chhod dete hai
 For example, Kejriwal became an engineer at IIT and left engineering for the IRS
 enjio kaa kaam karne ke liye iares kii naukari chhod di
 Left the job of an NGO to fight the fight against corruption on the road and finally left the work of active activist on the road to do politics
 dilli ke mukhyamantri bane to loksabhaa chunaav ladane ke liye dilli chhod di
 So, should we assume that the cms of Delhi are now following the path of Punjab and Goa

 On Saturday, 6 to 7 people came to the mandi fruit trader's office as income tax officers and escaped from the business with about 11 lakh cash and 42 tola gold
 lutere kaarobaari ke bahikhaate bhi apane saath le gaye hai
 The incident took place on Saturday in Azadpur, Asia's largest fruit and vegetable market
 chah se saat lutereinakam texfasar banakar fal kaarobaari haji jameel kuraishi ke offis pahunche or chand minute main revolver kii dam par jameel ko bandhak bana liya
 After this, the accused kept 10 lakh 80 thousand rupees and 42 Tola Sonalutlia in the office
 maamle main kai sawalpuliceko chaunkaa rahe hai
 Like why did Jamil keep so much gold in the office? Why did the robbers carry the books while going? Did the robbers know that Jameel lives alone in the office? Police are interrogating Jameel and his brothers, including his partner, in connection with all these questions
 police ko is maamle main ab tak koicisitivifootage nahin mili he
 Therefore, Mahendra Park Police Station is investigating the case from every aspect
 hardik patel kii chamatkaarik lokapriyata, rahul gandhi kii turshi, bhaajapa ke rajya netritv ke ficepan or jiesti kii maar ke baavjood koi samajhadaar raajnneetik prekshak gujarat main bhaajapa ko kamjor aankane kii galati nahin kar saktaa
 Then what is it that the war of Gujarat has become so thorny
 yah pichley teen saal kaa kamaal he jisane gujarat ke chunaav ko bharat main pichley pachchis saalon kaa sabase rahasyamay chunaav bana diya he
 This election will bring answers to three such questions that Indian politics faces for the first time
 pehla - gahari aarthik mandi kaa chunavi raajnneeti se kya rishta he?doosraa - kya tarakkee ke baavjood asamantaayen badhati rah sakati hai or unke chunavi falit bhi ho sakate hai?teesraa - kya khaulate janandolanon ke baavjood logon ke chunavi faisle aparivartit rah sakate hai?beete teen saal main pradhanmantri narendra modi ke grih rajya main jo kuch hua he vah bhi shesh bharat se puri tarah fark he
 Just as Gujarat had been shining apart from the country in the last two decades
 yah uthaa patake narendra modi ke gandhinagar se dilli jane ke baad hui
 This change has its roots in the economy of the states
 gujarat main maahaul badalane kii pehali sarkari munaadi july 2016 main hui thi jab desh ko pataa chalaa ki 2014-15 ke dauraangujarat bharat main sabase tej vikaas dar vaale paanch rajyon se baahar nikal gayaahai
 He was now at number 10 and had fallen into deep depression
 yah aankada jis vittiya saal kii tasviir bataa rahaa tha vah narendra modi ke baad gujarat kaa pehla varsh tha
 Gujarat elections: Modi government showing backfoot from Parliament to the road, these are 3 proofs
 By this time, the Patidar movement had completed its first year
 aarakshan kii maang kar rahe berozegaar yuvaaon kaa andolan bhaajapa ko rajya kaa mukhiya badalane par majaboor karne vaala tha or 2017 main gujarat ko bhaajapa ke liye sabase kareebi ladaai bana dene vaala tha jise vah chutkiyon main jitati ai thi
 Recession, waste and Patidar If a country were in Gujarat, its recession would be a matter of discussion in the world
 pichley do dashakon main gujarat kii growth jitani tej rahi he dhalaan usase kahin zyada tej he
 Gujarat has been the charisma of industrial growth due to industrial infrastructure, coastal geography and private capital
 bharat main sirf chah fisadi jameen or paanch fisadi jansankhya vaala gujarat puure desh se tej (das fisadi tak) dauda
 Gujarat has 7 in the GDP of the country
 6 fisadi va niryaat main 22 fisadi hissaa le liya
 (strangely, in the handbook of economic data of the Reserve Bank and NITI Aayog, the data of Gross State Domestic Product of Gujarat - GSDP after FY 2013-14 is not recorded
 )lekin menuphaccharing par aadhaarit arthvyavasthaayen mandi main (seva yaa krishi vaali arthvyavasthaaon ke mukaable) zyada teji se tuutati hai isliye gujarat main mandi va bekaari shesh bharat se kahin zyada gahari he
 This slope started in 2013
 patidaar yuva andolan or gujarat main mandi kii shuruyaat samakaleen hai
 The business of Gujarat groaned due to recession and demonetisation and GST hurt, and the BJP had to raise the entire GST head for fear of electoral losses
 karishme kaa asamanjasmodi ke gujarat kaa karishma uski kheti ke purnajagaran main chipa he
 From 2001 to 2011-12, Gujarat's agricultural production was unexpectedly faster than the country (11 per cent against 3 per cent)
 khetihar growth ke baavjood gramin gujarat main saamaajik suvidhaayen pichhadirahi jo gavarnence kii pichley do dashak sabase badi uljhan he
 Since 2013, farming is also in trouble due to which the weather (drought-flood) is also market
 shahar udyog, sevaaon or sarkari naukari ke kaaran kisi tarah chal rahe hai, lekin mandi ne gaanvon ke liye maukey khatm kar diye hai isliye gramin gujarat kaa gussa is chunaav main bhaajapa kii sabase badi mushkil he
 How different the movement is from Gujarat? The past three years are witness to this; when the rest of India was discussing the good days under the leadership of the new government at the Center, Gujarat was getting fed up with the movements
 is rajya ne jitne andolan pichley teen saal main dekhe hai utane haal ke varshon main nahin hue
 Most of the movements were of youth, farmers, workers and businessmen who have been badly affected by the recession
 gujarat apane chote se bhugol main aarthik, saamaajik or raajnneetik karkon kii pechidagi samete he isliye gujarat kaa chunaav pichley do dashak kaa sabase romaanchak chunaav ho gaya he
 The Gujarat results will tell us, for the first time, how people vote between recession and unemployment
 likhnaa jaruri nahin he ki yah nishkarsh bharat ke bhavishya kii aarthik raajnneeti ke liye bahut keemtee hone vaale hai
 There are few months left for the assembly elections in Madhya Pradesh
 chunaav kaa samay kareeb dekhbyauhaari vidhansabhaamein siyaasi dalon kii sakriyata bad gai he, lekin sthaneey logon main pichley chunaavon main raajnneetik dalon kii ore se kiye gaye vaadon ke adhuraa rah jane ko lekar naaraazgi he
 The worst resentment is from not providing clean drinking water
 saaf he ki vidhansabha chunaavon main ummidavaaron ko pani ke muddon ko lekar sawaalon kaa saamana karnaa padegaa
 However, Rampal Singh, Congress MLA from Beauhari assembly seat in Sidhi Lok Sabha constituency of Shahdol district, is preparing to beat again
 adivasee bahul vananchal kshetra byauhaari vidhansabha seat parisemen ke baad anusuchit janajati varg ke liye arakshit he
 It includes one Nagar Panchayat and 149 Gram Panchayats
 sanjay tiger rigerv bafer jone ke liye prasiddh byauhaari main kul 2 lakh 84 hajaar matadaata hai
 Among these, tribal voters are 56 percent, while Brahmin voters are 28 percent
 congress kii paramparaagat seat byauhaari vidhansabha kshetra se 2008 membhajapaake tikat par bali singh maravi chunaav jite, magar congress ne 2013 main dobaaraa is seat par kabja kar liya
 Rampal Singh of Congress was elected MLA defeating Ram Prasad Singh Parsthe of BJP
 ab jab aagaamee vidhansabha chunaav main kuch maheenon kaa vakt shesh bachaa he to aise main donon siyaasi dalon ke netaa tikat paane ke liye sakriy ho gaye hai
 Former MLA Bali Singh Marawi leads the list of potential candidates in the BJP
 vahiin ram prasad singh par bhi bhagava party apana daanv laga sakati he
 While the current MLA in Congress Rampal Singh is considered the strongest candidate for the ticket
 haalanki pichley chunaav main kiye gaye vaadon kaa puraa nahin hona maujuuda vidhayak ke khilaaf ja saktaa he
 In such a situation, Mission 2018 will be no less than a big test for them
 pani kaa sankatbyohaari vidhansabha kshetra ke rahane vaale adivasee aaj bhi buniyadi suvidhaon se dur hai
 Government schemes are not accessible in this Vananchal area, 80 km from the district headquarters
 byauhaari main peya jal sankat bada mudda he
 Due to the drying up of the river, people are forced to drink contaminated water
 baan sagar pariyojna hone ke baavjood logon ko pani mayssar nahin
 Like in other parts of the country, unemployment is a big problem in Beauhari
 yuva palaayan ko majaboor hai
 At the same time, the demand of making Beauhari a district has also been raised from time to time

 Despite AB de Villiers being dismissed for zero against Hyderabad, Virat Kohli kept his team intact in the play-off race by scoring an unbeaten 44 off 19 balls
 hyderabad main barish ke bich kheli gai viraat kii pari ipel-8 kii signechar pariyon ke taur par yaad kii jaaegi
 Bangalore captain Virat Kohli is in fifth gear and for now Delhi or any other team can be considered a threat for Virat to be in form
 hyderabad ke kilaaf viraat kohli ke balle ne bada dhamal kiya
 This is probably a hint and also the question whether will Virat once again do something similar to reach Bangalore in the last four? Bangalore have more options in batting and bowling, but the Delhi team of Yuvraj and Zaheer, who defeated Chennai in the last match, will look to improve their overall image by performing brilliantly for the last time
 dilli ne apane aakhri match main chennai ko haraakar ye dikhaa diya ki bangalore kii team unhen halke main nahin aank sakati
 Despite scoring 15 points from 13 matches, the trio of Bangalore star batsmen have a real test of time
 captain viraat kohli (13 match- 480 ran, 3 ardhshtak), jeniyas abi divilliars (13 match- 446 ran, 1 shatak or 1 ardhshtak) or dhamaakedaar ballebaaz kris gail (11 match- 422 ran, 1 shatak or 2 ardhshtak) ke saath bangalore kii taaqat chauguni nazar aati he
 Apart from Mitchell Starc (10 matches - 18 wickets), Yajuvendra Chahal (12 matches - 17 wickets) and David Weisz (11 matches - 13 wickets), Herschel Patel (12 matches - 12 wickets) has also proved to be a useful bowler for Bangalore
 tippaniyan Even in the last match of the league, everyone will keep an eye on Yuvraj Singh (13 matches - 237 runs, 2 fifties) worth 16 crores
 yuvaraj ke alaava shreyas ayyar (13 match- 419 ran, 4 ardhshtak), captain jepi dumini (13 match- 347 ran, 3 ardhshtak) or mayank agarwal (10 match- 213 ran, 2 ardhshtak) dilli ke jeet ke nayak ban sakate hai
 Zaheer (4 overs - 1 maiden - 9 runs - 2 wickets), who bowled 19 of 24 dot balls in the last match, can show Delhi's power again
 unke aane se dilli kii gendbaazi main jaan aa gai he
 But bowlers like Zaheer with Nathan Culter Nile (11 matches - 15 wickets), Imran Tahir (10 matches - 15 wickets) Amit Mishra (12 matches - 9 wickets) kii maujuudagi dilli kii taaqat badha detii he
 Delhi have also defeated big teams in their five matches so far, so Bangalore need to be careful in order to get a play off stage ticket

 Its video will be released soon

 On August 13, a tricky question was asked on the channel's Twitter handle
 magar is sawaal ke saath yuj kiya gaya hashtag # bb13war charchaa main aa gaya he
 There are speculations on social media that # bb13war's connection is with the show's theme
 is baar big bos kaa theme war ho saktaa he
 So the show's makers are promoting this theme differently
 twit main # bb13war kaa istemaal kar mjedaar sawaal poocha gaya
 It is written - If Shilpa Shinde and Deepika Kakkar were in the same season of Ibrahim Bigg Boss, according to you who would have won the show?

 Here, Amit Shah, Modi's closest aide for nearly a decade in the fray, was celebrating his birthday as well as victories in Maharashtra and Haryana
 is sab ke bich sarkaar kaa neeras kaamkaaj chalaane kii puri jimmedaari vitt-raksha-company kaary mantri, shahari nafasat kii pratimurti arun jetali ke kandhon par aa gai
 He announced the freeing of diesel prices from control, and on the other hand expressed a desire to reduce interest rates, to Rs 80,000 crore
 ke raksha kharid project manjuur kiye
 Not only this, he has also been the target of the Supreme Court in the last few days in the case of black money on 627 Swiss bank accounts of Indian citizens and nris
 hindutv ke is yug main pracheen granthon se tulana karne kii puri chhot he
 If Modi is Ram, then Shah and Jaitley are his Laxman and Arjuna, who fulfill him and without whom Modi is no longer alive
 puure desh ko bhagava rang main rangane ke baad shah kii najar ab bihar or uttar pradesh par he, jahaan kramshah 2015 or 2017 main vidhansabha chunaav hona he
 Much has been written and said about their importance in newspapers and television
 lekin yah bhi sach he ki ahmedabad dilli nahin he or gujarat to katai bharat nahin he
 Even though the way Shah has recently won the party, the condition of the Congress is gradually starting to resemble the Muslim League of 1947
 yah bhi yaad rakhana hoga ki 2010 main jab supreme court ne shah ko gujarat chhodie par majaboor kiya to unhone sidhe jetali ke ghar main sharan lee thi
 a BJP leader has confirmed that "there has not been a single day in the past few years when the two have not eaten together
" ” party adhyaksh hone ke baavjood shah par hatya ke do maamalon main chargeshit he or kehete hai ki kanoonee maamalon ke jaankaar jetali in mukademon main unke anaupchaarik salaahkaar hai
 The truth is also that Jaitley is the real inner person in this city, where proximity to power and access to information only gives strength and creates strength
 jetali 1970 ke dashak ke shuruaati daur main aresas kii chaatr shakha akhil bharti vidhyaarthee parishad (abivipi) ke netaa rahe hai, phir ve modi ke paksh main 2001 main unke gujarat kaa mukhyamantri banane se pehle hi khadey rahe hai or 2002 main dangon ke kaale dinon se lekar agle uthal-puthal bhare varshon main modi kaa haath thame rahe hai
 Apart from this, Jaitley has a wide network in political, legal and social circles
 in tamaam vajahon se jetali ne pradhanmantri narendra modi ke agal-bagal kahin bhi baithne kii anuthi yogyata hasil kii he
 Given the extent to which Modi is adept at smelling power, he is certain that he is well aware that if he could not hold his own on important pillars like media, corporate and diplomatic world in the capital Delhi, then he won 282 seats in the Lok Sabha
 Despite their unique feat of doing so, their hold on the power-system will not remain as strong
 isiilie diwaali ke baad 400 se adhik patrakaron kii mejabani ke liye diwaali milan kaa aayojan alag arth rakhata he
 Modi and RSS activists and many campaigners are well aware that very few people like Jaitley have a good relationship with all these communities in the BJP or, say, the entire political fraternity
 asal main diwaali milan jetali ke liye bhi chah saptaah tak aspataal main swasthya laabh karne ke baad sabake saamne aane kaa mauka tha
 He had to be kept in the isolation ward of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) when some problems arose after undergoing gastric bypass surgery at Max Hospital in early September
 (ames main le jane kii ek vajah kathith taur yah bhi thi ki rojaanaa milane aane waalon se unhen alag rakhaa ja sake
 Among them was Shah, who used to come to talk about the Haryana and Maharashtra assembly elections
 ) jetali kaa vajan 17 kilo ghat gaya he or 31 saal se jari diabetes kii dawa bhi bahut kam ho gai he
 He took over the job a week before this Diwali meet
 lagaataar najaron menhaal hi main jab kaale dhan kaa mudda surkhiyon main aayaa or satta main aane ke baad pehali baar sarkaar ko sharmidagi uthaani padi to bataur vitt mantri jetali hi sabaki najaron main ghirte dikhe
 The Supreme Court soon had to agree that it would give the list of account holders to the SIT, which was set up at the end of May
 haalanki jetali ke puraane mitra atorni general mukul rohtagi ne adaalat main hi kaha bhi tha ki vitt mantralay june ke ant main hi yah suchi esaity ko saunp chukaa he
 The question of whether Jaitley lacked in terms of fulfilling government obligations due to absence from long-term work has no special meaning
 unki beemaari pradhanmantri or saare desh se chhipi nahin rah saki kyonki bajet bhaashan ke dauraan kar prastaavon kii ghoshnaa se thik pehle ve viraam lene par majaboor hue the
 Never before has such a break been taken
 kuch din baad modi ne jetali ke bete or beti rohan or sonaali ko 7 rescorse road par naashte par bulaayaa or kaha ki unhen turant apane pita ko bairiatric surgery karaane ke liye raji karnaa hoga, kyonki, “unhen abhi kai or saal sarthak kaam karnaa he
 "and for that they have to be more healthy
 parivaar ke ek sutara ne isaki pushti kii he
 In the hospital too, Modi's eye was on the improvement in Jaitley's health
 modi america jane se pehle maiks aspataal main unhen dekhne bhi gaye
 He used to talk to Jaitley over the phone between New York and Washington twice a day between his speech at the United Nations General Assembly and meeting with US President Barack Obama

 Therefore, Modi entrusted this responsibility to Jaitley

 In the Gujarat elections, BJP has fielded candidates for all 182 seats
 bijepi ne somvaar ko apni chhathi list jari karte hue 34 ummidavaaron kaa elaan kiya
 Amidst the resentment of the Patidars, tickets for the candidates of this community have been increased, but the BJP has fielded the most OBC candidates
 isse ye kayaas lagane lage hai ki kya patidaar samudaay kii naaraazgi kii bharpai ke liye bijepi obisi vot par is baar daanv laga rahi he
 The BJP knows that the Patidar community seeking reservation in this election can pull it off
 BJP ne utaare 61 obisi ummidavaarabijepi ne is baar 61 obisi ummidavaaron ko tikat diya he
 While 52 Patidars have entered the electoral arena on behalf of the BJP
 haalanki 2012 ke vidhansabha chunaav ke mukaable is baar saat adhikpatidaaron ko tiktadia gaya he
 After these two communities, BJP has given maximum number of tickets to Scheduled Tribe candidates, numbering 28
 iske baad kshatriya samudaay ke 13, anusuchit jati ke 12 or brahman samudaay ke 9 ummidavaaron ko bijepi ne tikat diya he
 The Patidars also have an impact of 35 per cent of the total population in the state, which is why the BJP has played a part in the community by abandoning its traditional supporters, the Patidars
 saath hi obisi main 146 jatiyon ko shaamil kiya gaya he
 OBC community enjoys 27 percent reservation in the state
 inke mukaable rajya main 13 fisadi patel aabaadi he jo chunaav main kaaphi asardaar sabit ho sakati he
 Outrage over the agitation In the last days, the Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti (PAAS), headed by Hardik Patel, had demanded reservation for caste to be included in the OBC list, demanding reservation across the state
 iske baad sarkaar ne is maang ko khaarij kar diya, ise lekar kai jagah hinsak pradarshan bhi hue
 As the elections approached, Hardik also announced his support for the Congress
 unka kahana he ki congress ne unki maang ko gambhirtha se suna or ise puraa karne kaa bharosa dilaayaa he
 Hardik is constantly attacking the BJP over the issue of reservation
 congress bhi is mudde ko khub bhunaa rahi he
 In such a situation, BJP does not want to risk by giving tickets to more Patidars
 patidaaron main bijepi ke prati kuch had tak aakrosh he or hardik samarthak yuvaaon kaa ek bada varg chunaav main bijepi kaa saath degaa, yah kaha nahin ja saktaa
 Therefore, the BJP has given tickets to more and more OBC leaders playing cautious moves to reduce the impact of the resentment caused by Patel reservation movement in the elections

 punjab main loksabhaa chunaav prachaar ko lekar congress ne star prachaarkon kii list jari kii he
 In this, Congress President Rahul Gandhi at number one, Sonia Gandhi at number two, Dr
 at number three
 manmohan singh, chauthe number par aashaa kumari or paanchaven number par siem captain amarinder singh hai
 But the most surprising thing is that Navjot Singh Sidhu's name is at number 28 in this list
 punjab kii raajnneeti main acchhee-khaasi dakhal kaa kaa daawa karne vaale siddhu kaa naam list main itane neeche hone se unke samarthakon ko niraashaa ho sakati he

 iske alaava siddhu kii patni navjot cor ko unki pasand kii chandigarh seat se tikat dene se manaa karne par bhi vah 20 din tak party karyaalay nahin gaye the
 Congress has fielded senior leader Pawan Bansal as its candidate from this seat
 pehle charchaa thi ki navjot cor ko amritsar seat se tikat diya ja saktaa he, jahaan se amarinder singh ne saal 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bhaajapa ke arun jetali ko haraaya tha
 But these discussions also came to an end when the Congress gave ticket to Amritsar Lok Sabha seat to Gurjit Singh Ojla
 punjab main navjot singh siddhu ko zyada tavajjo na dene kii vajah unka captain amarind singh ke saath matbhed he
 The first controversy was about his participation in a comedy show on a private channel while he was in the post of a minister
 uske baad unkapakistan main imran khan ke shapath grahan main janaa bhi vivaadon main ghir gaya tha
 His decision was questioned by Captain Amarind Singh
 iske baad patni ko chandigarh yaa amritsar se tikat na die jane par vah khaase naaraaz rahe or vah kareeb 20 din tak party karyaalay nahin gaye the
 During a program, he was not given a place on the stage, whose pain he also told in front of everyone
 aapako bataa den ki punjab kii 13 loksabhaa siton par matdaan 11 may ko hoga or nattejey 23 may ko aaenge

 The BJP and the Left responded that Finance Minister Pranab said that the Prime Minister's Office has received the resignation of Dinesh Trivedi on Sunday and it has been sent to the President for approval as per the constitutional process and until his resignation is approved by the President Trivedi is the railway minister of the country
 bijepi or left kii baat kaa jabaav vitt mantri pranab diya ki pradhanmantri karyaalay ko ravivaar ko dinesh trivedi kaa istipha mil chukaa he or sanvaidhanik prakriya ke tahat use manjuuri ke liye raashtrapati ke paas bhej diya gaya he or jab tak unka istipha raashtrapati manjuur nahin kar letin trivedi hi desh ke rail mantri hai

 unhone is baat se inkaar nahin kiya ki harish ravat ko hataane kii koi zarurat nahin padegi yaa padani chahie, ek tarah se alaakaman ko is ore gaur karne kaa ishaara ho
 Then when he was asked whether your name was being discussed for the post of Chief Minister, he clearly said that he is not discussing but it is being discussed all around

 What do analysts believe? When talking about their claim in the election, political analysts believe that the victory of aap's assembly will be seen in the Lok Sabha as well and its traditional voters, especially the middle and lower and poor sections are strongly associated with it

 The Congress lost Bengal in two phases by allying with its split faction and the Left Front

 They have to increase their strength while at the peak of their popularity
 aakhir, ek baar chotii par pahunchane ke baad aap keval ek hi ore ja sakate hai or vah he neeche kii ore

 Politics in the state has once again come to the fore with the rise of some BJP leaders in Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar's feast

 Chief Minister Nitish Kumar hosted a banquet for members of both the houses on Monday night at his government residence in Anemarg, Patna to mark the final round of budgetary session of Bihar Legislature

 Senior BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi, while presenting his argument for joining this feast, said that this feast is not given to any specific party but personally to all the members of the Legislature, so the party whip cannot be issued for this
 
 yah vyakti vishesh par nirbhar karata he ki ve jaaen athwa na jaaen
 Leader of Opposition in Bihar Legislative Assembly Prem Kumar said that the reason for not attending the Chief Minister's own feast was to be lathi-charged by the police, including teachers and home guards, seeking solutions to their problems in the state, Prem Kumar said In such a situation, his soul does not allow him to join it
 vahiin is daavat main nahin shaamil hue bhaajapa ke ek anya varisht netaa nandakishor yadav ne kaha ki ek kaarykram main shaamil hone ke liye mujffarpur main hone ke kaaran ve isamen bhaag nahin le paa rahe hai
 It is noteworthy that in 2009, Nitish Kumar was angered by the then Chief Minister of Gujarat, Narendra Modi, publishing advertisements in newspapers on the financial assistance given during the Kosi tragedy
