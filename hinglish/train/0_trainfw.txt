 Gambhir scored 102 while Raina smashed an unbeaten 65 to help India reach their target of 287 by scoring 288 for five with two balls to spare

 Earlier Sri Lanka scored a strong 286 for five with the help of half centuries from Kumar Sangakkara (73), Angelo Mathews (71 not out) and Mahela Jayawardene (65)

 Gambhir completed the 11th ODI century of his career in just 96 balls by playing Mathews for a single at backward point
 vah haalanki maithyuj ke agle over main tej ran lene ke prayaas main pavilion laut gaye
 He played the ball at mid-on and ran for a quick run but before he reached the crease, Isuru Udana uprooted his stumps
 bharat ko antim 11 over main 87 ran kii darkaar thi or aise main raina ne pathan ke saath milakar tabadatod ballebaaji karte hue team ko jeet dilaa di

 Talking about giving defamation notice within 48 hours against the BGP leaders who have made allegations against themselves in coal allocation, Union Coal Minister Sriprakash Jaiswal said that the needle of suspicion in the CBI and the inter-ministerial investigation was allotted in the Bharatiya Janata Party-ruled states
 Going towards coal block
 isaliye party baukhala gayi he or vah chaahati he ki jald se jald sabhi koyala blaak aavanton radd kar diye jaaen
 Jaiswal said the BJP concluded the Parliament session by staging a sit-in on the Gandhi statue, while he had no connection with Bapu's policies
 jaiswal ne kaha ki bijepi ne sansad ke satr kaa samaapan gandhi pratimaa ke samaksh dharna dekar kiya vah galat tha, kyonki bijepi ne hi sansad ko bandhak banaaye rakhaa or chalane nahin diya or ab gandhi pratimaa ke samaksh dharna dekar naatak kar rahi he
 The Bharatiya Janata Party is a party doing politics by spreading rumors, it has betrayed the public by not running Parliament, because during this session many bills related to the public could not be passed due to BJP
 jaiswal ne yahaan congress karyaalay main samvaadadaata sammelan main kaha ki sibiai or antar mantri samooh (iemji) kii jaanch main koyala blaak aavanton maamle main jis tarah bhartiya janata party shasit rajyon ke netaaon kii kalai khulne kii sambhaavna bad rahi he, usase is party ke netaaon main baukhalaahat fail gayi he
 He alleged that the BJP leaders are thus plotting and conspiring how to save their leaders
 isaliye bijepi netaa aisi maang kar rahe he ki jald se jald sabhi koyala blaak aavanton radd kar diye jaye or unke netaaon ke naam saamne na aane paye
 Jaiswal said that but this is not going to happen, the CBI is also conducting its investigation and the Inter Ministerial Group (IMG) is also investigating
 jitne bhi koyala blaak aavanton kiye gayi the unke kaamkaaj kii jaanch kii ja rahi he
 So that no wrong decision can be made
 unhone kaha ki jo bhi jaanch main nikalakar saamne aayegaa usee aadhaar par faisla kiya jaayegaa
 He said that the Prime Minister wanted the auction process to be adopted in the coal block allocation, but the state governments opposed it and now when they feel that they will be trapped, they are making a stir
 unhone kaha ki pradhanmantri manmohan singh kaa bedaag ricard rahaa he or unase istipha mangakar un par keechad oochhaalane kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 By doing this, the BJP wanted to save its existence
 unhone kaha ki jis jaiswal parivaar ke saath hamaare (shriprakash jaiswal) ke saath sambandh dikhaaye ja rahe he or media main aise photo dikhaaye ja rahe he
 BJP leaders LK Advani, Sushma Swaraj and Nitin Gadkari also visited that wedding
 is shaadi ke photo bhi dikhaaye gayi
 Jaiswal said that since the wedding ceremony was the daughter of a Jaiswal family
 isaliye media sirf unki hi photo dikhaa rahaa he
 The media is not showing photos of Advani, Sushma Swaraj and Gadkari
 unka maananaa he ki kisi kii beti kii shaadi main agar vah koi apradhi nahin he to janaa koi gunaah nahin he
 Jaiswal alleged that the 'chhutbhaiye' leaders of the BJP are accusing him against his bosses
 aise log saboot sibiai ke samaksh pesh karen or agar vah doshi paye gayi to unke khilaaf karrwai hogi
 Otherwise, such people should apologize to the people of Kanpur by putting a soot on their mouths
 unhone kaha ki bijepi ke jin ‘chhutbhaiye’ netaaon ne unke khilaaf aarope lagaaye he unke khilaaf vah 48 ghante ke andar manahani kaa notice bhejengen
 He said that the Bharatiya Janata Party did not allow the Parliament session to be held and how the Parliament was kept hostage, so that all the bills of public interest could not be passed
 magar ab desh kii janata sach jaan chuki he or vah bijepi ko kabhi maaf nahin karegi
 On the bjp's charge of impartiality of the cbi's investigation, Jaiswal said, then should the people of BJP be investigated
 jab unhen lag rahaa he ki sibiai jaanch main kahin vah funs na jaayen tab vah aisi maang kar rahe he
 He said that apart from the CBI, the inter-ministerial group is also investigating and whatever truth will be disclosed in front of everyone, because nowadays nothing can hide much time
 jald hi doodh kaa doodh pani kaa pani ho jaayegaa

 Bollywood actors like Shah Rukh Khan and Aamir Khan believe in doing less films but Akshay Kumar does not agree with this

 At the same time, i am doing what is best for me

 Comparisons should be made, after all, through hard work and struggle, they have achieved this position
 desh ke liye garv kaa pal he
 Give them congratulations too, but are you also sending congratulations to 'suresh Kumar Dhruv'? Do you know who they are? Probably not! Suresh Kumar Dhruv is a boy who was born in the thick forests of Chhattisgarh
 ek aisa jangal jise aap tres bhi nahin kar sakate maanchitr par
 Where even in the day, lions and bears used to come and take the children
 aise main baarah saal ke dhruv ko lekar unke mata-pita ne apane gaanv ke do-chaar or parivaar ke saath jangal chhodkar baahar aane kaa nirnay liya
 In 2006, Dhruv walked for several kilometers and came out of the forest
 us gaanv kaa mukhya sadak se dur-dur tak koi conection nahin tha
 No road connects any road to that village from any other city
 duniya se kate dhruv ko na to kapade pahanane kaa sahoor tha
 Neither did he understand any language
 tab unhen 'ramakrishna mishan hai skool' dwaara sanchalit ashram, jo har saal lagbhag adivasee samudaay ke sau bacchon ko apane yahaan laati he, dhruv ko bhi le kar aa gai
 Dhruv neither knew how to brush, nor used the toilet seat
 unhen shahari jindagi ke bare main koi jaankaree nahin thi
 It took almost three months to teach the ashrams how to dress, how to lift and sit and talk
 dhruv jab ye sab sikh rahe the unheen dinon skool ke maidan main pade ek puraane phutbal ko dekha
 Did not know what a problem this was
 bas yun hi use kik maar kar khilne lage
 Later, the teacher of the school saw and then started teaching him the game in the period of physical education
 2006 main ashram aae dhruv 2008 main apane skool ke phutbal team ke captain ban chuke the
 After that, he never looked back
 apane skool ko state level par kai trophy dilwane ke baad dasven naishanal asian skool footbal championships main china ko 1-0 se haraa kar dhruv ne mohan bagan jaise pratishthit club main jagah hasil kii
 When he was being honored for this victory on 3 October, he did not have good clothes to wear
 unhone vahi skool dwaara di gayi futbaal vaali blader main parade kiya
 Dhruva is currently in the twelfth and cannot stay in the ashram after this
 dhruv ko nahin pataa he ki ashram chhodane ke baad unka thikaana kahaan hoga? wo kahaan jaaenge? kahaan rahenge or footbal kii practice kaise karenge?unki ummid ab mohan bagan se he kyonki usee club ne unhen sin karne kii baat kii he
 Perhaps the next house they meet
 dhruv ke ek behatar bhavishya ke liye dua kiijie
 Because hundreds of brands are coming to sign Earth Shaw, but no one knows how the pole will shine in the football horizon, and this is not the story of the only pole in the country
 aap thodaa khojie-padhie to aise saikadon dhruv mil jaaenge jo chamak sakate hai duniya ke kshitij par magar unhen koi saport karne vaala nahin he
 No one takes such steps from the state government to the central government so that their future can shine
 duniya ke duusare deshon main na jane kitna kuch apane bacchon ke liye kiya ja rahaa, magar yahaan to anganbari main poshaahar kii chori se hi shuruyaat ho jaati he
 Schools that are government-run have only Khanapurti studies

 To avoid this uncomfortable situation, it is necessary that the Congress should fight on its own
 iske alaava vamapanthiyon kaa kor focus bhi dalit, pichde or muslim rahe hai
 But due to the weakening of the Left, other regional and national parties in every state made their incursions in this decisive vote bank
 yadi ab congress swayan se majbootee kshetreey dalon ke saath gathjod kar ladati dikhegi to congress kaa khoyaa hua yah vot bank dobaaraa party kii taraf aane kaa silsilaa shuru hoga

 " Selling and keeping of cow meat in Maharashtra has become a legal offense
 kanoon ke banate hi, raajnneeti se lekar soshal media par, maharashtra main gau hatya par lagi pabandi vivaadon main ghir gai he
 19 years ago, the bjp-shiv Sena government passed a ban on cow slaughter in Maharashtra
 somvaar ko raashtrapati pranab mukherjee kii manjuuri ke baad aakhirkaar wo kanoon ban gaya
 State Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis expressed his happiness and tweeted - Thanks a lot Hon President Sir for the assent on maharashtraanimalpreservationbill
 Our dream of ban on cow slaughter becomes a reality now
 - Devendra Fadnavis (@dev_fadnavis) On March 2, 2015, the bjp-shiv Sena government had banned cow slaughter by amending the Maharashtra Animal Protection Bill
 nae kanoon ke mutabik gau hatya aparaadh he
 Those selling and keeping beef meat can face up to five years in jail and a fine of up to ten thousand
 vaise to 1976 se maharashtra main gau hatya par pratibandh he
 But calves and cows could be killed by obtaining a certificate of fit to slaughter from the local administration
 1995 main ek kadam aage badhate hue bijepi-shivasena sarkaar ne maharashtra pashu sangrakshan kanoon main badlaav kiya tha
 However, the central governments that came after it did not get the President's seal on the bill
 rajya main bhi congress ke netritv main bani sarkaar ne vidheyak ko kanoon main badalane kii bijepi kii maang kaa koi jawaab nahin diya
 According to the traders of cow meat, this ban will take away employment from many
 saath hi duusari tarah ke meet ke daam badhenge
 Mohammad Qureshi, president of the Mumbai Beef Exports Union, said, "the biggest loss from this Kanu will be to the Quraysh and Khatik communities
" unhone kaha, 'jab yah khabar saamne ai he in donon samudaay ke log sadame main hai
 They are not literate
 isliye ab unke paas guzaara karne ke liye koi or rasta nahin bachaa he
 'it is believed that the ban on beef will shift the entire weight of buffalo meat
 isse meet ke daam bad jaaenge
 The leather industry may also suffer
 saath hi dawaai banane waalon ko bhi pareshaani hogi
 The ban on cow meat was also strongly reacted on social media
 twitor par # beefban se ye mudda mangalvaar raat tak sabase charchit vishay ban gaya
 This ban can also be difficult to implement due to the controversy surrounding it and becoming a religious issue
 kaiyon kaa ye bhi maananaa he ki ye pratibandh kaala bazaari ko bhi janm degaa

 Jeet ji most wanted gangster Anandpal Singh had plagued the police and the government
 ab police muthbhed main maare jane ke baad uske parivaar or samarthakon ke gusse kii aag se sarkaar tap rahi he
 From Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje to Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh, Anandpal's encounter has been scorched
 anandapal maut ke baad bhi sarkaar ke liye sirdard bana hua he
 For that, the Rajput community has come down on agitation and violence
 kareeb 50 hajaar se adhik log sadakon par tandav kar rahe hai
 They consider Anandpal as Robinhood
 apane samaaj kaa agua samajhate hai
 He beats in their hearts like beats
 rajasthan main aatank kaa doosraa naam ban chukaa anandapal pulisavaalon ke haathon mar kar bhi pulisavaalon kaa shikaar kar rahaa he
 While alive, Anandpal had targeted many policemen for his bullet
 ab rajasthan sarkaar kii neend haraam kar rakhi he
 On the death of this criminal who has come out of politics, politics is happening fiercely
 anandapal ke parivaar waalon ne pichley 3 hafte se uskaa antim sanskaar nahin kiya he
 His body is still kept in the freezer
 anandapal ke encounter par siyasat bhi tej ho chuki he
 The family and the Rajput society are constantly accusing the Vasundhara Raje government of conspiracy
 encounter ko farji bataa rahe hai
 The Rajput Karni Samaj says that there was a conspiracy against Anandpal first
 usko farji encounter main dher kar diya gaya
 The government is plotting against those who bring justice to his family
 siyasat kaa ye pahalu sirf rajput samaaj tak hi nahin he
 The Congress has also targeted the Vasundhara government
 congress kaa kahana he ki sarkaar ko sibiai jaanch karakar doodh kaa doodh or pani kaa pani saaf karnaa chahie
 Apparently, after the encounter of Anandpal, thousands of people standing with his family are also a big vote bank
 aise main ek gangster ke encounter ke baad se mache bavaal par siyasat bhi laazmi he
 Police Theory - Police killed Anandpal in an encounter in Churu at midnight of 24 June
 - anandapal kaa suraag uske gurgey devendra urf gattu se mila tha
 - He was arrested along with Anandpal's brother Rupesh alias Vicky
 - suraag milane ke baad pulisavaalon ne anandapal ko gheraa
 He shielded women to escape
 - pulisavaalon par eke-47 se kareeb 100 round goliyaan bhi barasaai
 - In response, the police also fired and finally eating 6 bullets Anandpal was killed
 - encounter main ek police afasar suryaveer singh or consteble sohan singh jakhmi bhi hue the
 Anandpal Singh's family does not believe in this theory
 isliye sibiai jaanch kii maang ko lekar anandapal kaa abtak antim sanskaar nahin kiya he
 Police suspect that many notorious crooks are now reaching Anandpal's house in the name of mourning
 shok kii aad main hinsa kii ja rahi he
 Rajput questions- When Anandpal himself was absconding
 uskaa gurga bhi kahin or tha, to police ko anandapal kaa suraag kaise mil gaya
 - When Anandpal was firing from AK-47
 uske paas kaartoos bhi bache the, to police anandapal ke kareeb tak kaise pahunch gai
 - Police talk about firing on Anandpal through glass
 raat ke vakt shishe main dekhakar goli kaise chalaai ja sakati he
 - In the midst of such a fierce encounter, how did the police put the glass in that house
 - ghayal pulisavaale usee birdari ke kyon he, jis birdari kaa anandapal tha
 - Despite the AK-47 bullets firing from the front, how were the policemen injured? - 4 ghante se zyada chale encounter kii khabar rajya ke grih mantri or aiji ko kyon nahin thi
 People believe Robinhood, people who question Anandapal Singh's encounter consider him as Robinhood
 jabaki police refford main wo itnaa kukhyat gangster tha ki adaalat ko bhi ek nahin 6 baar use bhagoda ghoshit karnaa padaa
 He escaped from captivity about one and a half years before the encounter
 uski talash main hajaaron poliwale lage hue the
 Used to say a hat on the English English head
 ankhon par chashma
 Shiny coat
 ird-gird pulisavaale
 jite-ji domineering gangster Anandpal was a law graduate, a very knowledgeable law
 farrotedaar angreji bolta tha
 The gangster always accused the charges of being a political conspiracy
 usne media se baat kahi thi
 Criminalists - Anandpal came into the world of crime in the year 2006 after losing the Panchayat elections by 2 votes to the son of former minister Harjiran Burak
 - 2006 main rajasthan ke deedwanaa main jeevanram godara kii goliyon se bhunkar hatya kii thi

 Even in the whole country such examples are few
 1995 main dilli main susheel sharma naam ke ek congressi netaa ne apni patni naina saahani ko katl karke use tandoor main jala daalaa tha
 The central government was forced to form a committee under the chairmanship of NN Vohra to investigate the nexus between the leaders and the culprits in view of the anger of the public across the country over the incident
 14 disambar 2011: tasveeron main dekhen india today07 disambar 2011: tasveeron main dekhen india today Taking seriously the plea of a bench of the Supreme Court, the Allahabad High Court today decided that it will file a petition in its court seeking removal of the remark on 'malfunction'
 sutron ne aaj bataaya ki elahabaad ucch nyaayalay ke nyaayadhishon ne 26 navambar ko ek baithak kar ucchtam nyaayalay kii ek peeth kii ucch nyaayalay kii karypranali or uski eemaandaaree par sawaal uthaati tippanee par naaraazgi jaahir kii
 It was decided in the meeting that an application for removal of such comments will be filed in the Supreme Court
 ullekhneey he ki elahabaad ucch nyaayalay ke ek sthaganadesh ke khilaaf apil par beete saptaah sunwaayee karte hue nyaayamurti markandeya katju or nyaayamurti gyaan sudhaa mishra kii adhyakshata vaali ucchtam nyaayalay kii peeth ne kaha tha ki ‘shakespeare ne hemelet main kaha tha ki denmark main kuch gadabad he or isi tarah elahabaad ucch nyaayalay main bhi kuch gadabad ho rahi he’
 The bench had also asked the Chief Justice of Allahabad High Court to take some tough measures, including a recommendation to 'transfer those who cannot be repaired'
 ucchtam nyaayalay ne apane 12 prishth ke aadesh main paroksh rup se kaha tha ki elahabaad ucch nyaayalay ke kai nyaayadhish ‘ankal jaj syndrome’ se peedit hai, jiske myne un nyaayadhishon se hai jo apane parichit vakeelon kii pairvi vaale pakshon ke anukool aadesh dete hai
 Allahabad High Court Senior Advocate Ravi Kiran Jain said that High Court judges should file a contempt petition
 unhone kaha ki is tarah ke notice se batch nikalne kaa koi kaaran nahin he
 
 
 The High Court has only one way to compensate for this loss and that is to give contempt notice to the judges of the Supreme Court
 jain ne kaha, ‘in tippaniyon ko hataane ke liye punariksha yachika daakhil karnaa iskaa samaadhaan nahin he
 The damage is already done and it can only be repaid if and only when a show cause notice is issued

 ' kuch dinon pehle big bos main hina khan ne shilpa scindia ko kol girl kah diya tha, jisase unhen aalochanaon kaa shikaar hona padaa tha
 Shilpa's brother Ashutosh has now reacted to this matter
 unhone Bollywoodlife
 Speaking to com, said what Hina said, it is not clear yet, but something has definitely been said poorly, due to which the video had to be muted
 hina hameshaa sho main kahati hai ki ladki hokar duusari ladki ke bare main galat nahin kahana chahie to unhone aisa kaise bol diya
 Priyank Sharma, who arrived at Shahrukh's party, did a dance with Neha Dhupia when Vikas called him on when he created so much uproar when he said in another context
 hina ko apni galati kaa ehsaas hona chahie or aage ke sijan main aane vaale contestants ko bhi aisi bhashaa kaa prayog karne se pehle satark rahanaa chahie
 Let me tell you that a few days ago a video of Hina was revealed from Bigg Boss, in which she was seen calling Shilpa a call girl
 video main hina kah rahi thim- maine bolaa naa wo baat aise karti he, jaise
 
 
 Call Girl Word was muted
 haalanki soshal media par hina ke phens kah rahe hai ki unhone kol girl nahin, chol girl kaha tha
 Shilpa became a serpent to the tune of snake development, video viral Arshi reacted on this video saying that if Hina has said so, she will always regret it
 ek website se baat karte hue arshi ne kaha- main kuch media reports ko dekhakar hairaan rah gai thi, jahaan kaha gaya tha ki hina ne shilpa ko kol girl kaha he
 i condemn this statement
 hina ne aisa kah kar blendar kiya he or unhen puri jindagi iskaa pachhtaawaa rahegaa
 There has been a figure of 36 between Hina and Shilpa Shinde since the beginning of the show
 isse pehle bhi hina ne shilpa ke liye lujar or bhens jaise shabdon kaa istemaal kiya tha
 After the incident of rape, the police registered the case, the victim had forgotten with her 10-year-old sister, another case of rape has come up in Hyderabad, Telangana
 yahaan chandrayangutta thana kshetra main ek 18 varshiya ladki se ek auto driver ne kathith rup se rape kiya
 When the victim forgot her way with her 10-year-old sister, the accused auto driver offered them help
 iske baad 8 disambar kii raat ladki kaa auto driver ne yon utpeedan kiya
 The auto driver raped the girl at a lodge in Nampally area of the city
 is maamle main police ne cese darj kar liya he
 Earlier in Hyderabad, a case of gang rape and murder with Doctor Disha came to light
 isko lekar deshbhar main jamkar virodh pradarshan hua tha
 Subsequently, the police arrested four accused in the case
 iske baad maamle kii jaanch ke dauraan police krime seen ko ricreat karne ke liye aropiyon ko ghatnasthal par le gai thi or encounter main dher kar diya tha
 Police claim that the accused had snatched the weapon and attacked it with stones while recounting the crime scene
 iske baad cross firing main chaaron aropiyon ko dher kar diya gaya
 After this, questions were raised on this encounter of Telangana Police and petitions were filed in the Supreme Court and Telangana High Court in the case
 iske baad supreme court ne encounter kii jaanch ke liye ayog gathit karne kaa aadesh diya
 This commission has been ordered to be formed under the leadership of former Supreme Court Justice VS Sirpurkar
 is jaanch ayog main bombai hoicourt kii purv nyaayamurti rekha sondur baldota or purv sibiai diarector diaar kartikeyan ko shaamil kiya gaya he
 Apart from this, the team of National Human Rights Commission had also visited the spot regarding the police encounter
 kaashi ke sadhu-santon ne sarkaar se ek nai maang kar di he
 The All India Saints Committee has opposed the Central Government's decision to award scholarships to 5 crore Muslims in the name of minority
 sant samaaj kaa kahana he ki desh ke 8 aise rajya hai, jahaan hindu alpsankhyak hai
 So, will Hindus be considered a minority in these states and they will get the rights of minorities? Hindusant Samaj has been writing as a minority in 8 states and has asked the Central Government to clear the definition of minority
 id ke maukey par 5 karod alpsankhyak chaatr-chaatraon ko chaatravruti ke rup main dene kaa centre sarkaar kaa tohfa kaashi ke sant samaaj ko raas nahin aa rahaa he
 That is why the Sant Samaj of Kashi has written a letter to the concerned department-ministry including the central government asking for the definition of minority, because Hindus are also living as minorities in 8 states
 alpsankhyak samudaay ke 5 karod chaatro ko scolership kaa elaapulpsankhyak voton ko saadhane ke liye bijepi sarkaar ke man main alpsankhyakon ke prati umade prem kaa hi nateeja tha ki id ke din alpsankhyak samudaay ke 5 karod chaatro ko scolership (chaatravruti) dene kaa elaan kiya gaya
 This intention of the government has been questioned by the All India Saints Committee through its letter, in which they have not only asked the current government to define the definition of minority
 kya he alpsankhyak kii paribhaasha?pradhanmantri, alpsankhyak kalyaan mantralay, grih mantralay or alpsankhyak ayog ko 9 binduon par patr likhane vaale akhil bhartiya sant samiti ke mahaamantri swami jitendranand saraswati ne bataaya ki bhartiya samvidhan kii prastaavna main hi ek jan ek raashtra kii bhaavana kii baat kahi gai he
 Therefore, the definition of the word minority is nowhere in the Constitution
 disambar 1992 main congress sarkaar dwaara pehali baar alpsankhyak ayog kaa gathan sansad main prastaav laakar kiya gaya or yah samvidhan kii mul avadharana ke viruddh tha
 There is a question as to who are the minorities in India? Hindu minorities should also get government facilities
 The Sant Samaj says that Hindus are also present in eight states of India (jammu and Kashmir, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Punjab, Lakshadweep, Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh and Manipur)
 Are in the minority
 ye dhai pratishat se lekar 38 pratishat tak hi yahaan hindu hai
 So, should not the government provide facilities to minority Hindus in these 8 states? unhone kaha ki supreme court ne ek baar phir chunaav ke dauraan alpsankhyak ayog se maang kii he ki rajyavar alpsankhyak kii paribhaasha rajyavar tay karke bataaie or ham sarkaar se yahi maang kar rahe hai
 Therefore, we are happy to distribute the government scholarship to the minorities, but the minority Hindus of eight states should also be included in it and follow the parameters laid down by the Supreme Court
 bataa den ki modi sarkaar dwaara hajayatra se sabsidi hataa lene ke baad se hi sarkaar ko alpsankhyak khaskar musalmaan virdohi mana ja rahaa tha
 Apparently for this damage control, Modi Part-2 announced the gift of scholarship to 5 crore minority students on Eid to please the minority voters
 jisapar sant samaaj ab mukhar hokar saamne aane laga he
 In 8 states, the issue of protecting the interests of Hindu minorities has started to heat up

 purv sainik ram kishan greval ne jehar kha liya kyonki unhen purv sainik hone ke naate oropi lagu hone ke baad jo badha hua vetan milanaa tha vah nahin diya gaya
 His death has made politics hot on the issue of One Rank One Pension
 yah mudda purv sainikon kaa sabase ahm mudda rahaa he kyonki yah unke ritairement ke saath judaa hua he
 Subedar Grewal, hailing from a village in Haryana, served in the army for 30 years
 ek saal pehle jab pradhanmantri narendra modi ne jab oropi lagu karne kii ghoshnaa kii tab greval ko 25,500 rupee pratimah pension ke rup main mil rahe the
 But ever since the government implemented OROP, which provided a pension to a man who retired in a post, not to be seen when he retired and how many years he served in the army, Grewal was also in pension for three thousand Were entitled to an increase of Rs
 baavjood iske oropi lagu hone ke baad greval ko na to badha hua vetan abhi tak diya gaya tha na hi arier abhi tak unhen diya gaya
 Disturbed by this matter, Subedar Grewal (70) is said to have committed suicide on Tuesday
 sarkaar ne kaha ki unki pension ko sarkaar ne nahin roka tha, balki is maamle main deree ke liye adhikrut bank jimmedaar he
 For over a year, ex-servicemen and their widows, some of whom are more than 90 years old, staged a sit-in in Delhi and said that OROP had many flaws
 inamen sabase ahm tha ki vartmaan or purv pensionurs ke har paanch saal main pement kii dar main badlaav kii baat, jabaki purv sainik yah maang kar rahe the ki yah har saal hona chahie
 There has also been opposition from these people as to why those who have taken voluntary retirement voluntarily should be excluded from OROP
 purv sainikon kaa yah bhi kahana he ki nai or badi hui pension unhen 1 april 2014 se di jaae
 The government has said that arrears will be payable from July 2014
 raksha mantralay kaa kahana he ki badi hui pension jald se jald lagu karne ke liye harsambhav prayaas kiye ja rahe hai
 Not only this, sources say that in at least 500 cases, Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar himself intervened and got a solution
 tippaniyan Government sources say that out of about 21 lakh pensioners, only one lakh are left whose money is owed while the government has already released Rs 6000 crore in this regard
 bataa den ki purv sainikon ne soobedaar greval ke maamle main ho rahi raajnneeti kaa virodh kiya he
 Many say that they did not implement OROP as long as the Congress was in power
 inkaa kahana he ki bank is maamle main dhilaa ravaiya apanaate hai jisase deree hoti he
 So there is a group of ex-servicemen who are always ready to help
 haryana ke gaanv ke rahane vaale soobedaar greval ne sena main 30 saal kii sevaayen di thi
 a year ago, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the implementation of OROP, Grewal was receiving Rs 25,500 per month as pension
 lekin jab se sarkaar ne oropi ko lagu kiya jisamen ek pad par ritair hue aadmi ko ek pension kaa praavdhaan kiya gaya jisamen yah nahin dekha janaa tha ki vah kab ritair hua or usne kitne saal sena main sevaayen di, tab greval bhi pension main teen hajaar rupee kii vruddhi ke hakdaar ban gaye the
 Despite the implementation of OROP, Grewal was neither paid nor increased arrears yet
 kaha jaataa he ki is baat se pareshaan soobedaar greval (70) ne mangalvaar ko aatmahatya kar lee
 The government said that their pension was not stopped by the government, rather the authorized bank is responsible for the delay in the matter
 kareeb ek saal se purv sainik or unki vidhwaaen jinamein kuch logon kii umr 90 se bhi zyada he, ne dilli main dharna diya or kaha ki oropi main kai khamiyaan hai
 The most important of these was the change in the rate of payment of the present and former pensioners every five years, while the ex-servicemen were demanding that this should be done every year
 in logon kaa yah bhi virodh rahaa he ki jin logon ne swechha se samaypurv ritairement liya he unhen oropi se kyon baahar rakhaa jaae
 Ex-servicemen also say that new and enhanced pension should be given to them from 1 April 2014
 vahiin sarkaar ne kaha he ki arier july 2014 se dey hoga
 The Defense Ministry says that every effort is being made to introduce the increased pension as soon as possible
 itnaa hi nahin sutron kaa kahana he ki kam se kam 500 se zyada maamalon main rakshaamantri manohar parrikar ne khud dakhal diya or samaadhaan karaayaa
 The comments sarkari sutron kaa kahana he ki kareeb 21 lakh pensionadhariyon main keval ek lakh hi aise bache hai jinka paisa bakaayaa he jabaki sarkaar ne is sambandh main 6000 karod rupee pehle hi jari kar chuki he
 Explain that the ex-soldiers have opposed the politics happening in the case of Subedar Grewal
 kai logon kaa kahana he ki jab tak congress satta main thi to unhone oropi ko lagu nahin kiya
 They say that banks adopt a lax attitude in this matter which leads to delays
 aise main kuch purv sainikon kaa samooh he jo madad ko hameshaa taiyaar rahata he

 The Supreme Court has given triple talaq as unconstitutional

 The BJP has described it as a move towards New India
 teen talaak se peedit mahilaon ne bhi is faisle par khushi jaahir kii he or modi sarkaar kaa shukriya adaa kiya he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi described the decision as historic
 magar, bada sawaal ye he ki kya vaaki sarvocch adaalat kaa ye faisla muslim mahilaon ke bhavishya ko sanvaar paaegaa? AIMIM ke adhyaksh asaduddin ovaisi ne bhi yahi sawaal uthaaya he or kaha he ki kupratha kanoon se nahin sudhaar se khatm hogi

 unhone ye bhi kaha ki ek baar main teen talaaq dena sahi nahin he, lekin kai baar halaat aise ho jate hai ki talaaq dena zaruri ho jaataa he
 It is worth noting that Muslims will not accept this decision, because it is against Sharia

 khabaron ke mutabik, shekhar suman ne haal hi main die gaye ek intervyuu main is baat ko mana he ki kangana ranot unke bete adhyayan suman par kaala jaadu aajamaati thim
 Talking about this, Shekhar Suman said, 'one day my wife Alka opened the drawer of study in which betel nut, some coins and what-not-a-few things were found
 meri patni ne mujhe bataaya or kaha 'yah kya he', hamen ummid thi ki yah sabakaale jadoojaisi chijen adhyayan nahin kar saktaa
 'study's mother Alka said,' We called our family priest after this incident
 tab hamen pataa chalaa ki adhyayan ko hypnotise (sammohit) kiya gaya he kyonki uski ankhe dekhakar yah lagata tha ki yaa to usne koi nasha kiya he yaa phir wo kisi ke prabhaav main hai
 Shekhar Suman further said that one day the study came home completely bald and we asked him what it was, so he said to us in response, 'this is fashion you will not understand
 ' phir hamen baad main maaloom padaa ki yah sab karne ke liye usekanganane uksaaya he
 Kangana took the study to the Filmfare Awards

 Even Kangana kept giving interviews and studies stood behind her
 yah sab jaanakar mujhe mere bete ke bare main behad bura laga, main sach kahuun to mujhe aisa lagata tha ki main hajaar mautein mar rahaa hum
 She did not even look at him
 yahaan tak ki jab vah stage par gayi to usne adhyayan ko chhodkar sabakaa shukriya adaa kiya
 'the mother of the study talked about Kangana's behavior and said,' The way Kangana dealt with the study was horrifying
 vah uske saath gaali galoch karti thi, use maarthi thi
 We had never seen all this in our house
 'shekhar ne ek ore ghatana ke bare main bataaya, 'ek dfa adhyayan kaa subah 2 se 3 baje ke kareeb phone aayaa vah buri tarah ro rahaa tha or usne bataaya ki kangana ne use apane ghar ke baahar band kar diya he
 i asked to get the study to talk to Kangana, Kangana did not listen to one of mine and refused to take the study indoors
 main shaayad pehali baar itnaa ghusse main tha ki koi mere bete ke saath aise kaise kar saktaa he
 Shekhar also revealed that Study loved Kangana with a genuine heart
 vah hi ek thim jis par adhyayan sabase zyada bharosa kiya karata tha lekin kangana ne use dhokhaa diya
 Shekhar also told that the study decided to get away from Kangana when she read the messages sent to Kangana's Hrithik
 haalanki kangana kii ore se in sabhi aaropon par abhi tak koi pratikriya nahin di gai he

 Irfan Habib's claim, Padmavati's fictional character: Senior historian Irfan Habib has claimed that the character of Padmavati's insult is causing a ruckus by the Karni Sena and other organizations, there is no character in reality, because Padmavati is completely a fictional character

 This is a fictional character

 How can anyone believe that the government which can put crores of people in the bank lines to change notes to prove its integrity, is morally and constitutionally motivated the most responsible section of the country for a little transparency
 Can not do it! The system which wants to monitor every work of common people, it cannot compel the political parties of the country to even tell them that in the end Who gives the money? After looking at the scheme of new electoral bonds or political donations coupons, we can write that if clever, politics can interrupt the legitimate mechanism (bank) to keep the illegal
 elactoral bond yaa coupon isi chatur ranneeti ke utpaada hai, jahaan bainkon kaa istemaal avaidhta ko dhakne ke liye hoga
 - State Bank will sell Chanda coupons (1,000, 10,000, one lakh, ten lakh, one crore rupees)
 nirdhaarit aupchaariktaaon ke baad inhen kharid kar rajnatik dalon ko diya ja sakegaa
 Political parties will redeem it from the bank within 15 days
 coupon se mili chande kii jaankaree siyaasi dalon ko apane ritern (inakam tex or chunaav ayog) main deni hogi
 Actually, electoral bond is a new type of currency that will be used only for political donations
 ise padhein: crude oil samet in 5 muddon par 2018 main ludhak saktaa he share bazarasmajhnaa jaruri he ki bharat main rajnatik chande daagi kyon hai
 This is not because they are given in cash
 2016 main notebandi ke thik bichobich rajnatik dalon ko 2,000 rupye kaa chanda nakad lene kii chhot mili thi jo aaj bhi kaayam he
 The donations are disputed because the country never gets to know who is donating which political party? The donor will not be named on this coupon as well
 yani yah siyaasi chande ko uske samgr avaidh rup main suvidhajanak banane kaa rasta he
 Let us count the number of concessions given to political donations: - Atal Bihari Vajpayee government made political donations as VIP
 chanda dene vaali companiyaan ise apane khate main kharch dikhaakar tex se chhot le sakati hai jabaki siyaasi dalon ke liye chande puure tarah tex se mukt hai
 Data from the Association of Democratic Rights show that between 2012-16, the five major parties received 89 per cent (rs 945 crore) of their donations from companies
 yah lenden puri tarah tex free he
 - Congress government gave the facility to form an electoral trust for donations, through which money is given to political parties
 - notebandi hui to bhi rajnatik dalon ke nakad chande (2000 rupee tak) behaal rahe
 - Modi government went one further step
 vitt vidheyak 2017 main companiyon ke liye rajnatik chande par lagi adhiktam seemaa hataa lee gai
 Prior to this, companies made a maximum of 7 of their three-year net profit
 5 fisadi hissaa hi siyaasi chande ke taur par de sakati thim
 Companies were also exempted from the condition of telling how much money they paid to which party
 to phir siyaasi chande ke liye yah nai karency yani elactoral band kyon?tamaam riyaayaton ke baavjood nakad main bada chanda dena phir bhi aasaan nahin tha
 Electoral bonds will now make it convenient
 apni puri apaardarshita ke saath nakad chandee bank coupon ke jariye siyaasi khaaton main pahunchenge
 Only the political party will know who gave what, not the voters
 farji pahchaan (kevaisi) ke saath kharide gaye elactoral coupon, kaale dhan kii tex free dhulaai main madad karenge !ise padhein: bajet 2018: 2014 se 2017 tak yun badali bhartiya arthvyavastha kii suratyah vakt sarkaar se sidhe sawaal poochne kaa haih- rajnatik chande ko dohari (company or raajnneetik dal) iskar riyaayat kyon milani chahie? isse koun-si jan seva ho rahi he?- chande kii gopneeyata banaae rakhkar rajnatik dal kya hasil karnaa chaahate hai? desh ko yah bataane main kya harj he ki koun kisko kitna chanda de rahaa he
 India's election funding is an ongoing financial scam
 yah ek viraat lenden he jo loktantr kii buniyadi sanstha arthath rajnatik dal ke jariye hota he
 It is a type of investment that gives returns when the donor comes to power
 kya hamen sweekaar kar lenaa chahie ki sarkaar kisi kii ho yaa netaa kitna bhi lokapriy ho, vah bharat kii sabase badi rajnatik kaalikh ko dhakne ke sankalp se koi samjhauta nahin karegaa! yah andher kabhi khatm nahin hoga! The government is contemplating listing BSNL in the stock markets by issuing some new shares due to opposition from the employees unions and it may postpone plans for direct disinvestment in the company
 sarkaar or company prabandhan dwaara unionon ko raji karne ke kai prayaas vifal rahane ke baad sarkaar nae share jari karne par vichaar kar rahi he
 It is noteworthy that BSNL employees were also tempted with ESOP on attractive terms
 ek varisht sarkari adhikari ne pretre ko bataaya kiham beasenel ko pehle stock exenjon main soochibaddh kara sakate hai or phir vinievesh ke liye aage bad sakate hai
 The value of BSNL is estimated to be around $ 100 billion and the company has a paid-up capital of around Rs 5,000 crore
 bihar main ek baar phir se bijepi or jadyu gathbandhan main daraar padane lagi he
 The relationship between the BJP and JDU leaders is increasing with sour rhetoric
 pataa chalaa he ki gathbandhan main in dinon sab kuch thik nahin chal rahaa he
 There is also speculation about the future of the alliance between the leaders of both the parties with the fierce battle ahead of the Bihar Assembly elections
 janata dal united (jadyu) ke rashtriya mahasachiv or rajyasabha ke purv sadsy pawan verma ke taaja bayaan se gathbandhan main rishton kii kadavaahat kaa pataa chalata he
 He has expressed displeasure over the rhetoric of BJP leaders and said that if the BJP feels that it will succeed by contesting elections alone, then it can take a decision
 use nirnay karnaa ho to kar le
 Recently, BJP MLC Sachchidanand Rai of Bihar created a stir in the political corridor by giving a statement
 unhone kah diya tha ki party netritv nitish sarkaar ko die samarthan par vichaar kare
 No such statement had come from any BJP leader so far
 unke bayaan se bijepi netritv bhi chintit hua
 Assuming Sachidanand Rai's statement as anti-nda, BJP has issued a notice to him and sought clarification
 bihar bhaajapa anushaasanamak karrwai samiti ke adhyaksh amrendra pratap singh ne bihar vidhaan parishad sadsy sachchidanand raay ko kaaran bataao notice jari karte hue 10 din main jawaab maanga he
 Let me tell you that the relationship between BJP and JDU started when the Modi government 2
 0 kii cabinet main uchit sankhya main tarjeeh na milane par jadyu ne sarkaar main shaamil hone se dur rahane kaa faisla liya tha
 The statements of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar also showed resentment towards the BJP leadership
 baad main nitish sarkaar ke mantrimandal vistaar main bhi bijepi ke vidhayakon ko jagah nahin di gai thi
 This was seen as revenge
 iske baad kendriya mantri giriraaj singh ne bhi ek daavat ke maukey kii tasveeron ke jariye nitish par nishaanaa saadhaa tha
 Since then, there have been intermittent statements between the leaders of the two parties, making the coalition uncomfortable
 sochie agar aap kahin baithe hai or aapke aas-paas koi jaharila saanp chipa ho or is baat kii khabar bhi aapako naa ho he
 But after a while, how will it feel if the snake comes in front of you

 desh kii rajdhani or aasapaas ke shaharon main sardiyon kaa mausampradooshanke lihaaj se sabase gambhir hota he
 The question arises as to why and how a sheet of smog surrounds the city just before the beginning of November, making the air poisonous
 TERI (the Energy And Resources Institute) dwaara jari kii gai ek study report main pradooshan se jude kai sawaalon ke jawaab saamne aae hai
 Sumit Sharma, working on environment and pollution matters for TERIK, shared an interesting study report with 'aaj Tak', stating that 36% of pollution in the winter season is generated from Delhi
 jabaki baakiensiarase 34% pradooshan dilli main aata he
 Also 30% of the pollution comes from NCR and International Boundary
 kya he pradooshan failane kii vajasaham sawaal ye he ki sardiyon main dilli main kin vajahon se kitna pradooshan failata he
 PM 2 according to TERI
 5 ke liye jab akalan kiya gaya to hairaan karne vaale aankade saamne aae hai
 Which vehicle spreads how much pollution PM 2
 5 ke liye sirf vaahanon kaa aankada dekha jaae to isse hone vaale pradooshan kaa kul yogadan lagbhag 28% he
 Of this 28%, heavy vehicles such as trucks and tractors have the highest 9% pollution
 do pahiyaa vaahanon se 7% pradooshan failata he
 5% from three wheelers, 3% from other four wheelers and 3% from buses
 saath hi lcvs vaahan kaa pradooshan failaane main 1% yogadan paaya gaya he
 How much benefit from the BS4 engine scheme Sumit Sharma, associated with TERI, quoted the report as saying that the scheme of BS4 engine used for vehicles in the transport sector has been implemented and BS6 standard will be implemented by 2020 which will be in order to deal with pollution
 Great move
 haalanki TERI kaa maananaa he ki jab tak puraani gadiyon ko badalakar nai gadiyon ko sadak par nahin utaara jayega, tabatak puraani takanic kii vajah se pradooshan badhata rahegaa
 How much pollution from dust PM 2 in Delhi
 5 ke str main dhul se failane vaale pradooshan kaa yogadan 18% he
 Out of this 18%, pollution from road dust is 3%, construction work is 1% and for other reasons 13% pollution is spread
 dilli main PM 2
 At the level of 5, the industry contributes 30% of pollution
 is 30% main power plant kaa 6%, eenton kaa 8%, stone krashar kaa 2% jabaki anya choti badi industry se 14% pradooshan failata he
 So there is a contribution of 10% in polluting the residential areas of Delhi
 paraali se mahaj 4% pradooshansbase dilachasp baat yah he ki sardiyon ke puure mausam main kheton main lagaai jane vaali aag (paraali) or biomas se failane vaale pradooshan kaa yogadan mahaj 4% he
 It is important to know here that the contribution of the first burning in the neighboring states of Delhi between October and February is to contribute to pollution
 TERI se jude sumit sharma bataate hai ki paraali ek episod kii tarah he
 Which produces the most effect in about 15 to 20 days
 is dauraan kisaan sabase zyada paraali jalaate hai jis vajah se pradooshan apane ucch str par pahunch jaataa he
 In these 15 to 20 days, 30% of pollution in Delhi is due to stubble burning
 lekin sardiyon ke puure mausam kaa akalan kiya jaae to paraali jalaane kii vajah se failane vaale pradooshan kaa yogadan behad kam ho jaataa he
 How to increase PM 10TERI report has also studied the level of PM 10 in the winter season
 report ke mutabik vaahanon se failane vaala pradooshan 24%, dhul kaa 25%, industry kaa 27%, paraali or biomas se 4% he, jabaki rihaayshi ilaakon se 9% pradooshan failata he
 According to Sumit Sharma, the study report states that biomass cooking is still done in 3 million households in NCR
 isse failane vaale pradooshan kaa asar dilli kii hawa main bhi hota he
 Apart from this, vehicles, industry and biomass burning in Delhi alone are the three main reasons for rising pollution levels
 (photo-ap)ensiaar main kya he pradooshan kii vajahiske alaava TERI ne dilli se sate hue shahar main pradooshan kii stithi par bhi ek study kii he
 Sumit Sharma says that cities like Noida, Ghaziabad and Gurugram are affected by Delhi's pollution
 noida main 40% pradooshan kii vajah dilli kaa pradooshan he
 Apart from this, pollution of the industry is very high in Ghaziabad
 to vahiin gurugram main vaahanon kaa pradooshan behad prabhavi he
 While biomass burning is the main cause of pollution in Panipat
 aapako bataa den ki TERI dwaara yah study report saal 2016 main taiyaar kii gai thi
 Which has been released in the month of August this year
 dilli main pradooshan kii vajahon ko jaanane ke liye alag-alag reports aati rahi hai
 Reports suggest that Delhi needs to find solutions to tackle its own pollution rather than external problems

 is kadi main aaj pesh he libya ke taanashaah karnal gaddaphi ke ayyashi kii kahaniyaan
 He would go to a school or college every time
 kisi ek ladki ke sir par haath rakhata or wo ladki agle hi pal uske haram main pahunchaa di jaati
 There her status is nothing more than a doll to satisfy the hunger for sex
 karnal muammar gaddaphi kii maut ke baad uske haram se baahar nikalne vaali kahaniyon ko sunakar har kisi kaa dil dahal gaya
 Libyan dictator Colonel Gaddafi, who trampled Libya for 40 years, was fond of attending schools
 uski maut ke baad jab ladakiyon ne apana munh kholana shuru kiya to puraa libya sann rah gaya
 The secret of Gaddafi's hobby of going to school was revealed
 logon ko pataa chalaa ki skulon main karnal gaddaphi ke kisi ladki ke sir par haath rakhane kaa matlab kya hota tha
 Gaddafi used to gesture with a hand on the head
 jo ladki use acchhee lagati uske sir par wo haath rakh detaa tha
 Gaddafi's guards knew the meaning of the gesture
 ishaara milte hi usee roj ladki ko uthaa liya jaataa or phir vah uske haram main pahunch jaati thi
 Girls were decorated there
 unhen hameshaa hameshaa ke liye gaddaphi kaa gulam bana diya jaataa tha
 Gaddafi's henchmen used to pick up Kamaşin girls for Gaddafi's beds under the pretext of talent hunt in Libyan schools, colleges
 unako chunane ke baad haram main bhejne se pehle wo us ladki ke khun kii jaanch karte the, taaki ye pataa chal sake ki wo kisi beemaari kaa shikaar to nahin he
 The girl was then sentenced and sent to Gaddafi's bedroom
 itnaa hi nahin gaddaphi ke haram main nai ladakiyon ko uskaa sex slave banane kaa kaam bhi ek aurat hi karti thi
 Gaddafi entrusted this task to a woman named Mubaraka
 mubaraka in maasoom bacchiyon ko ashleel filmein dikhaane kaa kaam karti thi
 Girls who refused to do so were punished with a terrible punishment
 sanakee taanashaah gaddaphi kii ayyashi kii kahaniyaan 'in gaddafij haram' naamak ek kitaab main darj hai
 This book has been written by Anik Kojian
 anic ke mutabik, jo bhi gaddaphi ke haram se nikali ladakiyon kaa sach sunegaa wo sharmasaar ho jayega
 The story of 18-year-old Huda is also written in his book
 use laalach dekar sex slave banaaya gaya tha
 Gaddafi placed a shameful condition in front of him to make Huda his harem
 shart ye thi ki yadi huda gaddaphi ke haram main aati he to uske bhai ko kaid se reeha kar diya jayega
 The madness of sex was so much on this dictator that the security guards around him were also beautiful women
 wo bhi haram kii shaan badhaayaa karti thim
 Gaddafi also maintained a secret hideout at Tripoli University for his studies
 40 saal main gaddaphi kii ayyashi or julm ne libya kii awam ko uske khilaaf apni aawaaj buland karne par majaboor kar diya tha
 By the way, the most important character in Gaddafi's dictatorship was women

 On the occasion of International Women's Day, the Central Government is going to present the Women's Reservation Bill today
 rajyasabha main yah bill pesh hona he
 Today, during the Question Hour in the proceedings of the Parliament, the Samajwadi Party started an uproar
 iske chalate rajyasabha ko sthagit karnaa padaa
 The uproar was seen in both the houses of Parliament
 bill ke pesh hone main koi aadchan na aae ise dekhte hue congress or bijepi apane saasandon ko vip bhi jari kar chuki he or sarkaar ko puraa bharosa he ki is baar koi dikkat nahin aegi
 If the Women's Reservation Bill is passed in both the Houses of Parliament and it gets the President's seal, then every third seat in the Lok Sabha and the Legislative Assemblies of the country will be occupied by women
 bill ke kanoon banane se na sirf mahila shashaktikaran kaa sapana saakaar hoga balki duniya ke sabase bade loktantr main mahilaon ko uchit sammaan bhi milegaa
 The support of two-thirds of the mps is required to pass this bill in the Rajya Sabha and if you look at the current state of the Rajya Sabha, then this bill can be easily passed
 rajyasabha ke kul sadasyon kii sankhya he 233 or iskaa do-tihaai hota he 155
 The major parties supporting the bill are Congress (71), BJP (45) and Left (22)
 inke alaava biju janata dal, assam-gana parishad, naishanal conference, telugudesham party, ensipi, diemke, trinmul congress or janata dal(es) jaisi choti-choti partiyaan bhi is bill kaa samarthan kar rahi hai
 All these parties have 26 mps
 is tarah kul milakar 164 saansad is bill ke samarthan main hai
 In such a situation, the Rajya Sabha is ready to give this precious gift to the women of the country on the occasion of International Women's Day, if the bill does not come to a halt due to the snatching of the bill or the strong uproar
 sansad main mahilaon ko 33 fisadi aarakshan dene ko lekar kareeb 14 saal se raajnneetik khinchataan jari he kyonki kuch partiyaan iskaa shuru se hi iskaa maujuuda swaroop main virodh kar rahi hai
 The Women's Reservation Bill was first introduced in Parliament in 1996, when HD Deve Gowda was the Prime Minister
 sipiai kii netaa gita mukherjee kii adhyakshata main gathit cameti ne mahila aarakshan par report bhi pesh kar di lekin virdohi dalon kaa samarthan nahin milane se vidheyak paarit nahin ho sakaa
 Two years later, in 1998, the NDA government tried again to pass the bill, but once again it was opposed
 1999 main atal bihari vaajapeyi kii sarkaar ne dobaaraa is bill ko pesh kiya lekin ise paas karaane main kamyaabi nahin mili
 On the formation of the fifteenth Lok Sabha, President Pratibha Patil in her speech expressed the government's commitment to the Women's Reservation Bill
 isliye upie sarkaar is baar mauka haath se jane nahin dena chaahati
 If the Women's Reservation Bill is passed in both houses of Parliament, then it may take a long time to implement it
 sarkaar isi koshish main he ki wo kisi tarah bajet satr main mahila aarakshan bill ko rajyasabha or loksabhaa se paarit kara le
 Thereafter it has to be sent to the legislatures of all the states later to form an opinion on the bill
 mahila aarakshan bill ke paksh main kam se kam aadhe rajyon kii vidhansabhaon se muhar lagavani hogi jiske baad hi ise raashtrapati kii manjuuri milegi or kanoon kaa darja mil paaegaa

 The bets on the Indian team's World Cup title save are negligible, but the victory of the Indian team against Pakistan in their first match of the World Cup is almost all agreed
 bharat or pakistanravivaar ko edilade ovel main ek-duusare ke khilaaf apane-apneworldkabhiyaan kii shuruyaat karenge
 On the eve of his first match, Indian team captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni assured his fans that the players of his team have the ability to withstand the pressure of this match
 dhoni ne kaha ki is match ko lekar bhartiya team ke khilaadiyon main bechaini nahin he, balki ve kaaphi sanyat hai or unke paas bade maichon kaa dabaav jhelane kaa anubhav he
 Dhoni argues that playing in the highly pressurized and packed stadium of the Indian Premier League (IPL) has prepared his team well for the World Cup
 lekin dhoni shaayad yah bhul gaye ki worldcup jaise toornament main dabaav sahane kii kshamta nahin, balki vipakshi team par dabaav banane kii kshamta safalataa dilaati he
 Hosts New Zealand and Australia have shown how the opposition team is forced out of the match on the strength of batting
 ise sanyog hi kahenge ki donon hi mejabaanon newjiland or australia ko unki vipakshi tiimon ne toss jitkar pehle ballebaaji ke liye aamantrit kiya or donon hi tiimon ne shuruaati power play kii samaapti tak apekshit shuruyaat hasil kar lee
 During the World Cup, which took place 23 years ago in the Australian continent, the Indian team managed to defend their 216-run score against Pakistan and bowled Pakistan at 173
 lekin vah daur aisa tha jab 220 se zyada kaa score acha mana jaataa tha
 Dhoni may prefer to bowl first against Pakistan, so that his ineffective bowling attack takes advantage of the fresh pitch
 lekin aisi sthiti main duusari pari main edilade ovel kii pich spin gendbaajon ke liye madadgaar sabit ho sakati he
 The performance of the Indian team in Australia since November last year cannot be said to be favorable for the preparation of the World Cup, but India may not get a better program than this in the World Cup
 bharat or pakistan ke bich edilade main hone vaale world cap mukaable se pehle jaruri he donon tiimon ko aankadon ke taraazoo par bhi taul liya jaae

 From the current Indian team, only 4 players have participated in the World Cup
 ye he mahendra singh dhoni, viraat kohli, suresh raina or ravichandran aswin
 2
 pakistan kii taraf se 6 khilaadiyon ko worldcup kaa anubhav he
 These are Shahid Afridi, Younis Khan, misbah-ul-haq, Umar Akmal, Wahab Riaz and Ahmed Shehzad
 kuch khel visheshgyon kaa to yahaan tak kahana he ki worldcup kaa praaroop isliye aisa rakhaa gaya he taaki bharat toornament main jyada se zyada samay tak compatishan main bana rahe
 And perhaps even the ICC does not want the Indian team to be out before the knockout
 bharat ke liye pakistan ke khilaaf pehla match kai myanon main behad ahm he, kyonki jeet milane par bharat kaa nokout main janaa kaaphi had tak tay ho jayega
 After this, India will have to win only two matches to save the title, but India's victory will depend to a large extent on these questions
 
 
 - test maichon main behad kharaab pradarshan karne ke baad kya bhartiya gendbaaji antarrashtriya vanade main khud ko patari par lautaa paaegi?- match jitau gendbaajon ke abhaav main kya ballebaaji kharaab gendbaaji kii bharpai kar paaenge?- kya bhartiya fielder apane puraane dinon kii chhavi se baahar nikal paaenge?- kya bhartiya team dhoni ke saath us had tak kadamtal karne ko utsuk he, jaisi pichhali baar sachin tendulkar ke saath thi?- or ant main yah ki kya captain dhoni pichhali baar kii hi tarah apni team ke liye usee tarah prerana strot ban paaenge?- input IANS se Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh and SAD chief Sukhbir Singh Badal took to Twitter on Saturday to discuss the Sutlej Yamuna Link (SYL) canal issue, and the two presented themselves as the state's biggest benefactors
 isaki shuruyaat tab hui jab shiromani akali dal ke adhyaksh badal ne shuukravaar ko esavaiel mudde par nayi dilli main hui punjab, haryana or centre sarkaar ke adhikariyon kii baithak ke maddenjar apane twitor handle se mukhyamantri ko 'is vivaadaaspad mudde ko lekar kisi bhi dabaav main nahin jhukne' ke liye chetavanee deni chaahi
 There is no need for Punjab govt to participate in any meeting on the Sutlej Yamuna Link (SYL) canal
 i warn Pb CM @capt_amarinder not to succumb to any pressure & bargain away the river waters of Punjab
 The SAD stand is clear: Pb does not hv even a single drop of water to spare

 Ironic to see @officeofssbadal advising me on protecting Punjab's interests
 It was i who brought in 'the Punjab Termination of Agreements Act, 2004', abrogating the inter-state agreement to protect Punjab
 Let me not say more
 Unlike you Punjab is always first for me

 The Punjab government says that the water level in the state is very low
 agar ham sutluj-yamuna nahar ke jariye haryana ko pani dete hai to punjab main pani kaa sankat paidaa ho jayega
 At the same time, the Haryana government is asserting its authority over the water of Sutlej

 Vijay Rupani will take oath as Chief Minister of Gujarat on Sunday
 unke saath nitin patel bhi up mukhyamantri pad kii shapath grahan karenge
 Rupani will take oath at 1249 noon
 shapath grahan samaaroh main bijepi adhyaksh amit shah or vitt mantri arun jetali samet party ke kai bade netaa shaamil honge
 Rupani, 60, met Governor OP Kohli on Saturday to stake claim to form the government
 anandiben patel ke uttaradhikari ke rup main rupani ko shuukravaar ko bijepi vidhayak dal kaa netaa chunaa gaya tha
 Along with Rupani, several other leaders of the state including future Deputy Chief Minister Nitin Patel met the Governor
 haalanki nivartmaan mukhyamantri anandiben patel is mulaakaat ke dauraan maujuud nahin thim
 With the announcement of the name of bjp's Vijay Rupani as the Chief Minister in Gujarat, the Patidars have descended on the roads in Surat
 patidaaron ne haathon main vijay rupani or bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ke poster lekar virodh kiya
 Hardik Patel also opened Morcha While in Gujarat, he opened a front against the Patidars Navijaya Rupani, while Hardik Patel, who was tortured from Gujarat, shouted slogans against the next Chief Minister of the state even while outside Gujarat
 saath hi kaha ki wo patidaaron par lathi chalaane vaale bijepi ke party adhyaksh amit shah ke kisi bhi netaa ko apana samarthan nahi denge
 It will not be easy for Vijay Rupani, even for Ravvijay Rupani, this crown of Chief Minister will be filled, because on the one hand there is opposition from the Patidars, while the Dalits are also opening a front against the BJP these days
 duusari taraf aam aadmi party ne pehle hi gujarat main apane ummidavaar ko khadaa karne kii ghoshnaa kii he
 Hardik's threat to continue the movement will be interesting to see that while the Patidars are openly opposing Vijay Rupani, Hardik Patel issued a media statement from Udaipur saying that those who talk of Lokshahi do not have Lokshahi in their house This is not right hardik ne kaha ki jab tak patidaaron ko nyaay nahin miltaa tab tak aarakshan andolan chaalu rahegaa
 
 oona ghatana par daliton kii paidal yatraavhin daliton ne 4 agast se dalit paidal yatra nikaali hai, jo 15 taarikh ko dalit aazaadee din ke taur par manaa rahe hai

 dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal pichley ek maheene main pehle somnath darshan karne ke naam par or dobaaraa dalit cond ke peediton se milane ke liye gujarat aa chuke hai
 Kejriwal's growing Gujarat day by day is also a big challenge for the new Chief Minister Vijay Rupani
 aam aadmi party ke kejariwal isse pehle patidaaron ko apane paksh main lene ke liye hardik ke samarthan main video bhi jari kar chuke hai
