 The Congress is also slowly getting into the shelter of the cow
 chhattisgarh main congress ne gaayon ke liye twarit seva vical nikaala he
 Through this, health services will be provided to sick and injured cows
 abhi tak gaay par bijepi kaa raajnneetik ekadhikaar jaisaa tha lekin ab congress bhi maidan main aa gai he
 The Congress argues that the BJP is only doing politics over cows
 jabaki congressi aadmi shuru se gopaalak rahaa he
 The argument is that the bull pair was a Congress symbol in Nehru's time
 jabaki indira gandhi ke kaarykaal main gaay bachhda
 It is to be noted that the state assembly elections are due in the year 2018
 isliye congress kii ye gau seva sawari uske liye asli gau sevakon ke alaava aam logon se vot lene kaa jariya sabit ho sakati he
 In Chhattisgarh, the Congress has gone to the shelter of the cow
 abhi tak gaay ke sangrakshan ke maamle main bijepi kii hi raajnneetik hissedari thi
 But in view of the Vidhan Sabha elections to be held in the year 2018, now the Congress has also started raising cows
 chhattisgarh congress mukhyalay main ab gau mata kii jaijyakaar ho rahi he
 The party argues that the BJP is doing politics only in the name of cows
 bijepi samarthit kai kaaryakarta gau seva ke naam par hinsa kar rahe hai
 The Congress also alleges that many BJP workers are killing people in the name of cow protection
 uske mutabik pradhanmantri modi ke kaarykaal main bharat bif niryaat ke kaarobaar main brazil ke baad vishwa kaa doosraa bada desh ban gaya he
 Therefore cow protection is really needed
 gau sangrakshan ke liye congress ne chhattisgarh main nayi kavayad shuru kii he
 Party workers will now get sick and injured cows admitted to hospitals for treatment
 party ke mutabik maweshiyon khaastaur par gaay ke liye congressiyon ke dil main dayaa kii bhaavana he
 Whereas BJP only focuses on violence
 abhi tak gau sangrakshan ke maamle main sirf uskaa hi ekadhikaar tha
 The issue was not led by any political party other than in the political arena
 lekin ab use takkar dene ke liecongresubhi sadakon par utar ai he
 The party has warmly flagged down the cow ambulance on the streets
 udhar congress ke is gau prem se bijepi hairat main he
 However, the party argues that the Congress also had to come with cows
 isse saaf he ki congress satta main aane ke liebijepika anusaran kar rahi he
 Whereas BJP does not do politics about cow
 chhattisgarh main vidhaan sabha chunaav ke liye saal bhar se kam kaa vakt baaki he
 Therefore, both the BJP and the Congress parties do not want to be oblivious to any issue
 congress ko lagata he kigau sangrakshanke maamle ne bhi bijepi kii jholii voton se bhar di he
 While no concerted efforts are being made to conserve cows
 isliye party ne apane kaaryakartaaon ko maidan main utaara he

 in sutron ne naam nahin kholane kii shart par bataaya tha ki greval ko unki aadhikarik masik pension se har maheene 5,000 rupye kam bhugtan kiya ja rahaa tha

 "dismissed the allegations
 In the Bhiwani of the Indian State Bank, Ram Singh, the chief manager of the Ghantaghar branch, dismissed such allegations of the government coming out in the media

 Portal for Pensioners: The Government of India has created a dedicated portal for pensioners
 isamen karmchaariyon ke ritair hone se pehle hi sambandhit vibhaagon ke PPO jari karne ke niyam saaf kiye gaye hai
 It has been written that in case of any error, information should be given to its higher authorities or banks
 PPO ke hisaab se daali jaati he raashiram singh ne kaha, "hamaare (bank) yahaan se zyada kuch nahin hota
 We put the PPO amount in the pensioner's account and withdraw it
 agar pensiondhari hamen koi shikaayat karata he to ise sambandhit vibhaag tak pahunchaa diya jaataa he
 "according to Singh's information about pension, Grewal never raised any issue with the bank about his pension
 singh ne kaha, "unhone (greval ne) kabhi kuch nahin kaha
 If we had received a letter about a problem related to pension, we would have sent it to his former employer
 " singh ne vishesh jaanch team ko greval ke aakhri pension order kii rakam ke bare main bhi jaankaree di
 Singh said that on October 26, Rs 22,608 as pension was received in Grewal's account

 It is considered to be the biggest industrial strike since 1977

 Social media giant Facebook has launched a photo-based app
 isse pehle bhi fasebuk ne kai ap launch kiye hai, lekin inamen se zyada safal nahin hue
 The condition is that some of these companies have now decided to shut down
 fasebuk ne is photo shering ap kaa naam calphul balun rakhaa he
 According to a New York Times report, it has been launched just for China
 bibisi kii ek report ke mutabit iske liye fasebuk chini apadevelpar yug internet technologyke saath kaam kar rahi he
 According to the report, a representative of Fabsuk has said that Facebook is interested in China and is spending time in China trying to understand it in different ways
 aapako bataa den ki fasebuk kaa photo aadhaarit ap moments pehle se he
 It has the facility to store photo albums and this also makes Facebook sharing easier
 sabase khaas baat yah he ise china main chupake se launch kiya gaya he, kyonki china main iske liye kai regaullation se guzarana hota he
 Therefore, no official statement has come from Facebook yet
 fasebuk china main teji se apni services kaa vistaar karnaa chaahati he, lekin vahaan ke niyam kii vajah se aisa mumkin nahin he
 After India, China is a potentially big market for Facebook, but in 2009 China banned it

 They are also talking to the Chinese top brass to start their services there

 Union HRD Minister Smriti Irani is right to say that the teaching of German as a third language in Kendriya Vidyalayas is a violation of the trilingual formula and hence she has decided to replace German with Sanskrit
 lekin aisa karte hue ve bhul gayi ki darasal sanskrit bhi tribhaasha formule kii bhaavana se mail nahin khaati
 The aim of the trilingual formula was respect for India's linguistic diversity and different linguistic communities
 iske tahat sabhi logon ko angrezi or hindi ke alaava ek teesri bhashaa padhani thi
 People of West Bengal read Bangla under this, Marathi people from Maharashtra, Gujarati people from Gujarati and South Indians from different languages of South India
 is bhashaa niti main bharat kii vishaal hindi pattee ke saamne yah suvidha thi ki vah baaqi bhartiya bhashaaon main koi bhashaa chun leti
 If there was an arrangement to teach Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Marathi, Bangla, Oriya or other Indian languages in Hindi-speaking schools, then the relationship of this Hindi belt with the rest of the areas would have been much better
 duusare kshetron main bhi hindi virodh mand padataa
 But the Hindi people decided to read Sanskrit which is not spoken in any part of the country
 unhone us urdu ko bhi nahin chunaa, jiske bina hindi khadi nahin ho sakati
 It was a dishonesty that created a rift in the linguistic unity of the country
 kehane kaa matlab yah nahin ki sanskrit nahin padhai jaani chahie
 But Sanskrit should be studied as a classical language such as Pali or can be of Prakrit or Aditamil
 sanskrit beshak bahut sari bhartiya bhashaaon ke mul main he, lekin use bhartiya bhashaaon kii maa bataanaa darasal bich ke rishton kii kai kadiyaan kaat dena he
 Sanskrit is an old antiquity of ours, whose memory enriches us, but an attempt to forcibly incorporate it into the language — to bring it closer — confounds the relatives of the joint family of Indian languages
 magar samskruti or rashtrawaad kii nitant uthali samaj rakhane waalon ko or use bahut aakraamak dhang se pesh karne waalon ko bhashaa or samskruti kii yah baarik samaj koun de
 They just know how to do politics and in doing so, they also make German alien and also accept the easy acceptance of Sanskrit
 german or sanskrit ek hi parivaar kii bhashaaen hai
 German scholars have also done a lot of work in saving a lot of Sanskrit space at one time
 bhartiya bhashaaon ke liye to maxmooler kaa kaam aitihaasik he, lekin kendriya vidyalayon main pathnpathan ko apni raajnneeti kaa astr banane vaali sarkarein yah sab nahin dekh saktin
 She says to love both Sanskrit and culture, but actually plays hostility

 Resentful Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray, on the blog of senior BJP leader LK Advani about the 2014 elections, launched a scathing attack on him, saying that if Advani does not have courage and liver, he should come and borrow 'matoshree'
 unhone kaha ki varsh 2014 kaa pehla lakshya congress ko hataanaa he, lekin agar 'senapati' hi kehane lage ki jeet ke maukey nahin hai, to endie ke baaki ghatakon kaa kya hoga
 Bal Thackeray has also said that the Congress has been mobilizing the support of other parties with the help of the CBI
 agar adwani yah jaanate hai to yah kaam karne main kyon darate hai
 Thackeray's advice is that the quarrel between Bihar Chief Minister and Janata Dal (united) leader Nitish Kumar and Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi over the throne of Delhi is a later one, and the first challenge is to keep the Congress away
 bal thakare ne likhaa he ki blog bekaar kii chiz he, kyonki raajnneeti maidan main aakar kii jaati he, chataayee bichhaakar nahin
 Bal Thackeray has written this article in the Shiv Sena mouthpiece 'saamana', titled 'friend, don't dare lose'
 thakare kaa kahana he ki adwani kaa bayaan sirf bijepi se nahin judaa he, baat endie kii he, isliye ham is par pratikriya de rahe hai
 Advani's statement must have frustrated and disappointed the recent BJP team
 blog bekaar kii chiz he
 Right now the Congress should be a top priority
 unka kahana he ki endie kaa senapati hi kehane lage ki 2014 main chance nahin to baaki ghatak dal kiskaa munh takate rahenge
 Right now prophecy is not meant
 bal thakare ne likhaa ki congress ko satta se bedakhal karne ke liye shivasena, akali dal or jediu endie ke saath hai
 Apart from this, he says that others will also be added to this exercise
 unka anumaan he ki pavaar, mamata, naveen patnayak or diemke bhi judenge
 Let me tell you that there is uneasiness within the BJP regarding the blog of BJP leader LK Advani
 adwani ne likhaa he ki 2014 main gaiyr-bijepi, gaiyr-congressi shaks pradhanmantri banegaa
 BJP or Congress can support this government from outside
 yani bijepi apane dam par nahin jeet sakati
 The BJP leaders may not agree with the suppressed tongue, but Advani is firm on his stand
 tippaniyan He says that he stands by what he has written in his blog
 bijepi ke bheetar is bayaan ko lekar halchal machi hui he
 Advani's statement raises questions about the claim of both BJP and Narendra Modi
 yah baat endie ke bheetar nitish kumaar ke paksh main jaati dikh rahi he, lekin sharad yadav hi adwani kii raay se sahamat nahin dikhte
 On the other hand, the Congress is ridiculing Advani's claim that it will get less than 100 seats, but the question before the BJP is now that of damage control
 party ko lag rahaa he, yah kaam samay ke saath hoga
 He said that the first goal of 2014 is to remove the Congress, but if the 'senapati' starts saying that there are no chances of victory, what will happen to the remaining constituents of NDA
 bal thakare ne yah bhi kaha he ki congress sibiai kii madad se duusare dalon kaa samarthan jutati rahi he
 If Advani knows this, why is he afraid to do this work? thakare kii salaah he ki dilli ke takht ko lekar bihar ke mukhyamantri or janata dal (united) ke netaa nitish kumaar or gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi kaa jhagada baad kii baat he, or pehali chunauti congress ko dur rakhane kii he
 Bal Thackeray has written that blog is a useless thing, because politics is done in the field, not by laying the mat
 bal thakare ne shivasena ke mukhpatr 'saamana' main yah lekh likhaa he, jiskaa sheershak he 'dost, himmat mat haar'
 Thackeray says that Advani's statement is not just about the BJP, it is about the NDA, so we are reacting to it
 adwani ke bayaan se bijepi kii haalia team hataash or niraash hui hogi
 Blog is a useless thing
 abhi congress ko satta se bedakhal karnaa praathamikta honi chahie
 He says that only the NDA commanders started saying that in 2014, if the chance is not there, then the other constituents will keep on staring
 abhi bhavishyavaanee kaa matlab nahin he
 Bal Thackeray wrote that Shiv Sena, Akali Dal and JDU are with NDA to oust Congress from power
 iske alaava unka kahana he ki dusron ko bhi is kavayad main jodenge
 They predict that Pawar, Mamta, Naveen Patnaik and DMK will also join
 bataa den ki bijepi netaa laalkrishna adwani ke blog ko lekar bijepi ke andar bechaini he
 Advani has written that a non-bjp, non-congress man will become Prime Minister in 2014
 is sarkaar ko bijepi yaa congress baahar se samarthan de sakate hai
 That is, the BJP cannot win on its own
 bijepi ke netaa bhale hi dabi jubaan se isse sahamat na hon, lekin adwani apni baat par kaayam hai
 The comments unka kahana he ki unhone apane blog main jo kuch likhaa he, us par vah kaayam hai
 There is a stir within the BJP about this statement
 adwani ke bayaan se bijepi or narendra modi, donon kii daavedaari par sawaal uthte hai
 This seems to go in favor of Nitish Kumar within the NDA, but Sharad Yadav does not seem to agree with Advani's opinion
 udhar congress adwani ke is daawey kii khilli uda rahi he ki use 100 se kam siten milengi, lekin bijepi ke saamne sawaal ab damege control kaa he
 The party is feeling that this work will happen over time
 thakare kii salaah he ki dilli ke takht ko lekar bihar ke mukhyamantri or janata dal (united) ke netaa nitish kumaar or gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi kaa jhagada baad kii baat he, or pehali chunauti congress ko dur rakhane kii he

 Credit card can fulfill many of your small needs, now many car dealers are also giving their customers the option of paying with credit card
 tyoharon ke is mausam main dealer nahin chaahate ki koi graahak paise ke abhaav main khaali haath chalaa jaae or isliye ve unhen yah vikalp de rahe hai
 An English newspaper has reported that many automobile dealers currently ask customers to pay margin money through credit cards
 yah margin mani car kii kul keemat kaa 20 fisadi hota he
 After this, the customer can make the remaining payment either way
 dealer use lone bhi dilaa dete hai
 Bankers say that this system is coming for the first time in India
 darasal iske peeche bada kaaran yah he ki graahak margin mani yaa kuch bhi paise na hone par dealer ke yahaan se nikal jate hai or kai baar waapas nahin lautate
 This affects dealer sales
 ab ve unase credit card ke jariye thodaa bhugtan karvaa lete hai taaki uskaa man na badale
 Once the margin money has been paid, the customer becomes bonded and is forced to buy the car
 is samay kul margin mani kaa lagbhag 8 fisadi credit card se aa rahaa he
 But bankers say that this is not a proper mode of payment
 isamen jokhim zyada he
 Actually, the customer takes a loan twice, once through a credit card and the second time from a bank
 credit card se liya gaya lone mahangaa hota he kyonki us par byaaj kahin zyada lagata he
 This increases the load on the customer
 itnaa hi nahin isse credit card jari karne vaale bank kaa jokhim bhi bad jaataa he kyonki unke lone ke doobane kaa khatra bhi bad jaataa he

 sirsa main deraa sachcha sauda kii cheirperson vipasana insa se esaiti ke incharge ne somvaar ko kareeb sava teen ghante tak gahan poochtacha kii
 DSP Kuldeep Bainiwal answered questions from Vipassana over the arson and riots in Panchkula and Sirsa's Shahpur Begu and milk plants
 isse pehle bhi usko poochtacha ke liye bulaayaa gaya tha, lekin tab tabiyat kharaab hone kaa hawala dekar nahin ai thi
 After Gurmeet Ram Rahim goes to jail, all his secrets are being exposed
 ek taraf police uski khaas haniprit ko shiddat se talash kar rahi he, to duusari taraf esaiti ne deraa sachcha sauda kii cheirperson vipasana insa par bhi shikanja kas diya he
 On Monday, DSP of SIT Kuldeep Bainiwal called Vipassana at the Huda police post in Sirsa and questioned him in a closed room
 isse pehle poochtacha ke liye vipasana ko dhara 160 ke tahat notice dekar ravivaar ko bhi talab kiya gaya tha, lekin apni tabiyat kharaab hone kaa hawala dekar vipasana ravivaar ko poochtacha ke liye nahin ain thi
 On Monday, the interrogation lasted for about three and a half hours
 is dauraan panchakula or sirsa main hui hinsa or aagjanee ke sambandh main vipasana se sawaal kiye gaye
 After the inquiry was over, DSP Bainiwal informed the media that information has been collected about the arrival of Honeypreet on August 25 and 26 at Sirsa Dera
 vahiin vipasana insa se aditya insa ke bare main bhi sawaal puche gaye hai
 The DSP said that there has also been inquiries about the arson and violence in Sirsa and the Vita Milk plant in village Begu
 bainivaal ne kaha ki jo jaankaree unhen mili he, uski satyata janchi jaaegi
 Vipassana Insa will also be questioned again if needed
 vipasana se hui poochtacha main khulaasa hua he ki haniprit 25, 26 agast kii raat ko sirsa dere main ai thi
 Honeypreet came to Sirsa only once
 uske baad vah kahaan he, unhen nahin pataa he
 He made it clear that Vipassana could be questioned further in this case
 bataate chalem ki vipasana insa or haniprit ke bich chhattis kaa aankada mana jaataa he
 On one hand, Honeypreet had declared herself to be the real heir of Gurmeet Ram Rahim
 vahiin gurmeet ke jail jane ke baad se vipasana kahati aa rahi he ki haniprit kaa deraa sachcha sauda se koi lenaa dena nahin he or naa hi uski dere main koi hissedari he
 It is clear that there is a dispute over the ownership of the dera
 khudvipasanabhi nahin chaahati ki haniprit kaa ab dere main koi dakhal ho
 Amidst this tussle, finding Honeypreet remains a major headache for the police

 Sometimes death comes at a very wrong and awkward time and stands silently at the door
 hindi ke adwitiya kavi or vilakshan aalochak, chintak, anuvadak vishnu khare ke saath yahi hua
 Suddenly he was called from Mumbai to the post of vice president of Hindi Academy of Delhi and he was just beginning to play a long innings that Brain Hemorrhage had delivered him in a stunned condition at Delhi's Pant Hospital
 ve hindi sahitya ke ek jabardast yoddha the—aasaani se haar maan lenaa unke jivan kaa siddhant nahin tha
 We were all expecting his friends that they would suddenly rise up and ask in astonishment and anger - Oh brother, why have i been kept on the ventilator? Unfortunately this has not happened
 ve ek haftaa aspataal main rahane ke baad 19 sitambar kii dopaher kai bade adhure kaam chhodkar chale gaye
 He had been engaged in the English translation of Muktibodh's poems for the Raza Foundation for the past several months
 kaaphi kaam ho chukaa tha par abhi vah puraa nahin ho paaya tha
 He was preparing a special issue in the memory of Kunwar Narayan and Kedarnath Singh for Hindi Academy magazine
 jis din ve aspataal le jaae gaye, us shaam unhen isi visheshank ke silsile main kunwar narayan ke suputr apurv narayan se milanaa tha
 It is also ironic that Khare died on the birthday of Kunwar Narayan (his favorite poet)
 kuch tareekhen itihaas main ajeeb tarah se darj ho jaati hai
 And look at the condition of Hindi literature that Vishnu Khare was still fighting a 'coma' in bed that some young poets on Facebook started accusing him that the Hindi Akademi is encouraging old and poets leading to death
 asad jaidi, mangalesh dabraal or deviprasad mishra kaa kavy paath yaa devtale kii smriti main ek aayojan itihaas main is tarah se darj kiya jayega? academy kii purv adhyaksh maitreyi puspa ne is par jo tippanee kii vah bhi gaur karne laayak he
 The blood of the Hindi Akademi is in the mouths of old writers, whom they cannot leave
 ''main vishnu khare ko kareeb pachaas varshon se jaanata hum
 He was a unique and unique talent of Hindi
 yuva lekhakon main unki lokapriyata, unka sammaan bemisaal he
 He used to search and read young poets
 hindi academy main to abhi ve kuch kar hi nahin paae the par unke bare main ghatiya kism ke faisle danaadan suna die gaye
 Vishnu Khare was a genius — he could speak poetry, literature, mythology, Mahabharata, Foust, Bergman, Tarkovsky with authority over the Karayan
 gyothe ke foust kaa unhone hindi anuwaad bhi kiya he—guter grass kii kitaab jeebh nikaalnaa kaa bhi
 He had a close friendship with the Indian scholar German scholars — he had a tremendous intellectual dialogue with them
 ve is laayak the ki unhen sahitya academy ke adhyaksh pad par baitaakar kuch behtareen kaam karaae ja sakate the
 But the Hindi people chose their most capable scholar for this post
 hindi ke kai ausat lekhak, kavi sahitya academy puraskaar paa chuke hai
 But the poet whom many people consider to be the most important Hindi poet after Raghuveer Sahay, was deprived of the Sahitya Akademi Award in his life
 kai kadave tathy yaad aa rahe hai
 When the editor-in-chief of Navbharat Times Vidya Niwas Mishra was angry with Vishnu Khare, the local editor of his Jaipur, Lucknow etc
 editions, Dilip Padgaonkar was ready to make him the literary editor of the Times of India
 par mishra ne maalikon ko saaf kah diya ki is vyakti kaa transfar bhi nahin hone duungaa
 Take it out of the institute
 khare vivaadaaspad the, kai baar pasand-naapsand main jyadatiyaan bhi karte the par unki vidwata or pratibha anokhi thi
 Many of his literary enemies also respected his militancy from within
 pichley saal main unke hriday ke oparation ke baad india international centre main mila, to mujhe unke dekhne ke dhang se thodi chintaa hui
 It seemed as if they were fighting a secret battle with death
 maine unhen chote-se mail main iskaa zikr kiya
 His reply was, "I did not even understand yesterday and still not what you are talking about my way of seeing
" main kya us 'dhang' se tumhaare samet aas-paas kii duniya ko dekh rahaa tha?kya vah vaisaa he jaisaa us aadmi ke chehre par hota he jo jane-anjaane apni asann mrityu ko dekh rahaa ho? apni vah sensual mrityu

 This is the 'haggard medical look' that would have been on the face of a 77-year-old man who had gone through three operations in four months? It also happens that many times we even have a vivid imagination of family or friends or their heavy loss
 vaisaa cheharaa to tumhen nahin laga?'' (16 july, 2017)yahi kah saktaa hum ki khare jaisaa yogya or maanviya vyakti maine nahin dekha
 His 'durvasa Krodh' is discussed by people, but they do not recognize his deep humanity

 rajdhani kii ek bahadur beti ko dilli police ne bahaduree kaa certificate or 5 hajaar rupee inaam dekar sammanit kiya he
 The woman had recently fought back with two bike riding miscreants engaged in mobile snatching
 purvi dilli ke disipi omveer vishnoi ne 22 saal keebahadur betico nakad inaam or ek certificate dekar sammanit kiya
 In fact, the girl, who hails from Kalyanpuri area of delhi, left home to go to Janakpuri at 7 am on Sunday
 yuvati ghar se kuch dur pahunchi hi thi ki do bike savaar badmaash uske paas aae or usase mobile chhinane lage
 Instead of panicking, the woman confronted the miscreants and dropped them from the bike
 yuvati kii cheekh-pukaar sunakar log vahaan ikattha hone lage or unhone ek badmaash ko pakad liya
 However a crook managed to escape from there
 logon ne pakad main aae badmaash ko police ke hawaale kar diya
 The crook, who was caught in the police interrogation, said that he was involved in many incidents

 Seeing the courage of the girl, the Delhi Police decided to honor her
 dakshini dilli ke madanagir main ek naaballig samet paanch badmaashon ne thappad kaa badla lene ke liye ek kishor par chaaku se kathith taur par hamalaa kar diya

 Police said that when Chirag was closing his shop at around 9
30 pm on Saturday, Mukesh and Vicky came back again with two other boys Vishal and Raj and started beating him
 iske baad in ladakon ne chiraag ko pakadakar uske baayen kandhe par chaaku maar diya

 shekhar shaadishuda he or munispality main hi afasar he, duniyaadaari ke chalan ke mutabik bhrasht
 On the other hand, Subhash is a young political activist, who considers Chief Minister Dayashankar Pandey (rajesh Sharma), not Babuji, but his ideal
 bhale hi mukhyamantri ko lagata ho ki bhrashtachar kaa shishtachar yah kahata ho ki hajaar karod se kam kaa ghotaalaa unki tauheen he
 Subhash loves Tanya who writes the Chief Minister's speech and Babu ji also agrees to this relationship
 sab kuch saamaanya chal rahaa he
 And then comes the last day of Babuji's service
 unhen lagata he ki 37 saal kii eemaandaaree ke liye unhen shawl or nariyal dekar sammanit kiya jayega
 But due to someone else's mistake, they are stained with dishonesty

 The biggest feature of the film 21 Cannon Salute is its slick dialogues, simple story, but agile screenplay and great acting
 kehete hai ki mara hathi bhi sava lakh kaa hota he
 The same situation is also with Anupam Kher
 unka kirdaar jab jivit dikhataa he, tab to khub sanvarta hi he screen ko or kahani ko apni acting se
 But his corpse seems to be equally acting
 yahaan yah bataanaa lajimi ho jaataa he ki duusare half main film jane bhi do yaaron kii tarj par babu kii laash bhi ek kirdaar ban yahaan se vahaan dolati he
 So that his son can perform his last rites with respect
 subhash ke role main divyendu ne khub aag pani dikhaaya he
 He is a fan since the days of the film Pyaar Ka Panchnama
 ummid he ki mayanagari main unhen achche or vividhtapurna role milte rahen
 Manu Rishi has also done a lot in the role of cursed, timid, greedy, passionate elder son to his Babuji in the role of Shekhar
 film ke sanvaadon par bhi unka dilli vaala asar dikhataa he
 Tanya has had some good scenes in Aditi Sharma's role
 masalan, mukhyamantri kii gaali galouj vaali bhashaa ko sanyat spich main tabdeel karne vaala drishy
 But Aditi needs to work harder on emotional scenes
 mukhyamantri ke role main rajesh sharma us ashleelata ko bakhubi saamne rakhte hai, jo satta se chipke rahane ke sukh se chehre par pasar jaati he
 In the role of his ambitious mother, senior actress Uttara Baokar and girlfriend or trends, Neha Dhupia is also in the role of concubine

 Or the behavior of politicians with security and officers
 sab kuch samaaj kii kuch pravritiyon par nae sire se ungali uthaate hai
 Now the matter of some shortcomings, the duration of the film has increased somewhat according to the plot
 ise or chhanta janaa chahie tha
 Secondly, in the affair of Subhash's love angle, a song has been poured into pieces twice
 isse film pehle half main kuch dhili padati lagati he
 Third, the climax has been dragged away with the intention of conveying the film at the very end
 shaayad, film ke tittle kii salaamati ke liye
 To make the message of cleanliness even more effective
 yaa anupam kher ke shabdon main kahen to kaaman main kii jai ho bolne ke liye
 In the film '21 Cannon Salute', he is not a star
 masala nahin kahani he
 The clap is not a one-liner, but there are emotional dialogues
 isliye ise dekhnaa bura khyaal nahin
 Especially those who see honesty as an out-dated value

 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he) The film released this week 'poorna: Courage has no limit' is a film based on a true incident
 is kahani main telangna kii 13 saal kii ek adivasee ladki purna sabase kam umr main mount everest par chadhane kaa record banaati he
 The director of this film is Rahul Bose who has also played an important character in the film
 is film main aditi inaamdaar, hiba shah jo kii nasiruddin shah kii beti hai, dhruthiman chatterjee, es maaria or aarif jakariya bhi is film main ahm bhoomika main najar aae hai
 'poorna' is a small budget film but its message is big, and the big thing is that Rahul Bose has told a simple straightforward story, not worrying about the business of the film
 har film main kuch khamiyaan or khubiyaan hoti hai to 'purna' main bhi kuch khamiyaan or khubiyaan hai
 'poorna' is a girl that most people are unaware of, so you may not find the story interesting before you climb Mount Everest and you may lose patience
 is film main nirdeshak ne kahani ko zyada naatakeey karne kii koshish nahin kii he jo kii mere nazariye se acha he par darshakon ko ye thodaa feekaa lag saktaa he
 This thing is about the flaws and in my view, perhaps this film can be called a drawback
 tippaniyan Talking about the merits, it is its theme and its story which is inspiring
 is film kii sabase acchhee baat ye he kii nirdeshak or lekhak ne bina laag lapet ke badi saadagi se apni baat kahi he jo is tarah ke kirdaar ke saath mail khaati he
 It also shows its heart
 ye film garibon ke liye khole gaye vidyalayon main ho rahi dhaandhlee par bhi sawaal uthaati he
 Rahul has done a good job as a director but he has done a good job with him
 He also shows strong acting as an actor as well as Aditi who plays Poorna and apart from that the actors who are in small roles also have their own
 Have done justice to the characters
 'purna: courage haiz no limit' ek eemaandaar film he or darshakon ko ise jarur dekhnaa chahie
 Not every film is for entertainment
 kuch filmein prerit karne ke liye bhi hoti hai
 So go show your kids this week Poorna's story because this film is from my side 3

 court ke is faisle se punjab sarkaar ko karaara jhatka laga he
 Soon after the Supreme Court's decision, Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh called an emergency meeting of the cabinet on this issue
 baithak main faisla liya gaya ki punjab pani kaa ek bhi boond punjab se baahar jane nahin degaa
 In this emergency led by Prakash Singh Badal, it was decided that an appeal will be made to President Pranab Mukherjee not to accept the Supreme Court's decision on this issue
 is masale ko lekar punjab vidhansabha kaa vishesh satr 16 november ko bulaayaa gaya he
 At the same time, politics in Punjab has also intensified on this issue
 faisle ke virodh main congress saansad amarinder singh ne istipha de diya he
 All the Congress mlas of Punjab have also sent their resignations to Captain Amarinder Singh
 congress vidhayak dal ke depyuty leader bharat bhushan ne kaha ki punjab congress ke vidhayakon ne amarinder singh ko istipha bhej diya he
 On Friday, the speaker will personally submit his resignation
 unhone kaha ki punjab ek boond pani bhi dene kii sthiti main nahin he
 Captain Amarinder Singh had already said that all the Congress mlas would resign if the decision came against Punjab
 amarinder singh ke istife par mukhyamantri prakaash singh badal ne kaha ki ye raajnneetik drama he
 What to do next will be decided in the cabinet meeting
 supreme court ne faisla sunaate hue kaha ki punjab anya rajyon ke saath hue samjhaute se ekatarfa nirnay karke baahar nahin ja saktaa
 The court while responding negatively to the questions sent by the President in the Sutlej Yamuna Sampark Canal case said that Punjab's law to cancel water sharing agreements with other states is illegal
 faisle par haryana ke siem manohar laal khatter ne kaha ki faisla deree se aayaa lekin haq main aayaa
 i welcome it
 khatter ne faisle kaa kiya swaagataharyana ke mukhyamantri manohar laal ne supreme court kaa faisla aane ke baad kaha he ki ise lagu karne kii jimmedaari ab donon rajyon kii sarkaron kii he
 This is natural justice and no one should do politics on it
 mukhyamantri ne kaha ki supreme court kaa nirnay ab raashtrapati ke paas bheja jayega
 The President can now ask the Punjab government to withdraw the Termination Act which was passed against Haryana in 2004 in the Punjab Assembly
 supreme court ke faisle par adishnal atorni general devendra saini ne kaha he ki adaalat nehryana or punjabake bich chal rahe jal bantwaare ke vivaad main haryana sarkaar ke paksh main faisla sunaaya he
 This shows that Haryana will get water
 unhone bataaya ki supreme court ne kaha he ki jal bantwaare ke mudde par bane samjhaute ko todane kaa punjab sarkaar ko koi haq nahin
 This is a dispute between Punjab and Haryana for a long time there was a dispute over the water of the satluj-yamuna link canal
 2004 main tatkaaleen raashtrapati ne is maamle mensupreme courtse salaah maangi thi or usee par sarvocch adaalat ne faisla sunaaya
 Meanwhile, Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal said, "if the decision of the court comes against us, we will shed every bit of your blood, not water
 ' 'bin Laden', a wild spoiled elephant caught from Rongjuli in Golpara district in western Assam, died on Sunday
 van vibhaag ke adhikariyon ne use shant karne ke liye 11 november ko trankulij karne ke baad pakad liya tha or 12 november ko use orang neshnal park bhej diya gaya tha
 a senior national park official said, "he was fine but the keeper told that he died at 5
30 am today (sunday)
" ''35 varshiya is hathi kaa naam sthaneey logon ne al kaayda ke pramukh osama bin laden ke naam par bin laden rakhaa tha
 However, after being caught, it was renamed as 'krishna'
 vah 6 din kaid main rahaa
 The Assam government had already sent a team of specialist veterinarians including KK Sarma
 sarama postmortem kar hathi kii maut kaa kaaran pataa lagaayenge
 This troubled elephant was pacified by a party led by BJP MLA Padma Hazarika from Suti constituency
 team main van adhikari or pashu chikitsak shaamil the, jinhone hathi ko shant karne main sahaayta kii thi
 Although the Forest Department had earlier planned to release the elephant in the forest, but later decided to keep it in captivity in view of the strong opposition against releasing it
 log ashankit the ki hathi phir se maanav bastiyon par hamalaa kar saktaa he
 Let me tell you that usually elephants between six to seven years are kept in captivity

 As the Lok Sabha elections are getting closer, the news of the ballooning of the Grand Alliance exercises against the Modi government has started coming
 loksabhaa chunaav se pehle sapa-basapa ke bich gathbandhan kii atakalon se bihar kii siyasat se ab upi kii siyasat par sabaki nazren tik gai hai
 If sources are to be believed, SP chief Akhilesh Yadav and BSP supremo Mayawati have made up their mind to shock the Congress's grand alliance exercise and have prepared to contest the elections simultaneously bypassing the Congress
 sutron se mili jaankaree kii maane to mayawati or akhilesh yadav is saal hone vaale loksabhaa chunaav ke maddenjar seat-bantwaare ke formule ko antim rup dene ke kareeb pahunch gaye hai or bas sirf elaan kii deree he
 Sources claim that these two big parties of Uttar Pradesh will contest together in 37-37 Lok Sabha seats
 bataa denki uttar pradesh main loksabhaa kii kul 80 siten hai
 There is also a discussion in the political streets of UP that the seats of Amethi and Rae Bareli will be left in the BSP-SP alliance and no candidate will be fielded there
 iske baad jo siten batch rahi hai usase rashtriya lokdal or anya choti partiyon ke liye choda jaayegaa
 That is, if the alliance between SP and BSP is proved right, it means that the Congress will not be a part of this alliance and SP-BSP will make a strong effort to connect other regional parties of UP
 is tarah se dekha jaae to sapa-basapa kaa sangam hota he to congress bada jhatka to hoga
 At the same time, it will not be less than a big setback for BJP
 congress ke saath-saath bijepi ke liye jatke kii baat ko samajhane ke liye loksabhaa chunaav 2014 ke vot share par gaur karne kii jarurat hogi
 Actually, even though the BSP could not get a single seat in 2014, its percentage was close to the SP
 2014 loksabhaa chunaav bhartiya janata party sabase badi party banakar ubhari thi or usne 80 main se 71 siten jeet kar sabko chaunkaa diya tha
 The BJP, which won 71 seats at that time, secured a record 42 per cent of the vote
 vahiin, samaajawaadee party ke khate main kareeb 22 fisadi voton ke saath 5 siten ai thim
 In 2014, Mayawati's BSP could not get a single seat, but she had about 20 percent of the vote
 vahiin, congress ne raibareli or amethi kii siten jiti thim or usne kareeb 7 fisadi vot share hasil kiye the
 Now if we look at the vote percentage of all parties in UP in 2014, it seems that with SP-BSP, there will be a big change in the politics of UP
 agar sapa-basapa saath aati he to upi main in donon partiyon ko hi sabase zyada phayda hoga
 The reason for this is that if the sp-bsp's vote share is merged, it sits around 40 per cent, which is comparable to the BJP in 2014
 ab agar isi vot share se siton kii jeet kaa anumaan lagaaya jaae to ho saktaa he ki 2019 main sapa-basapa gathbandhan kaa aadhe se zyada siton par kabja ho jaae
 Apart from this, the SP-BSP would like that political parties representing backward classes like Nishad Party, Apna Dal (krishna Patel) join with it
 agar aisa hota he to congress ke liye 2019 kii raah or bhi mushkil ho jaaegi
 Because only 7 in the last election if not included in the coalition
 5 fisadi vot paane vaali congress ke liye mushkilen or badhengi or centre kii satta main vaapasi ke sapane bikhar sakate hai
 However, the BJP has denied any political damage from the SP-BSP alliance
 upi ke dipti siem keshav prasad maurya kaa kahana he ki sapa-basapa gathbandhan kare yaa na kare, hamen nahin lagata ki isse ham par koi prabhaav padegaa
 The country is with Modi ji and people want to see him become PM once again
 bataa den ki vidhansabha chunaav main jahaan bijepi ko 39
 SP and BSP got 22% if they got 6% votes
 donon ke voton ko mila den to 44 fisadi ho jaataa he
 The Congress got only 6 percent of the votes
 vahiin, baat karen loksabhaa chunaav 2014 kii to bijepi ko uttar pradesh main 42
 6% of the votes were received
 sapa ko 22 fisadi or bispi ko 20 fisadi vot mili the
 However, there are reports that the seat sharing may be finalized after January 15

 com / ngpsojg9x9 big bog (bigg Boss) ke pichley episod main paras chhabda ne 26 andon ko ubalkar barbaad kar diya tha, jiske baad big bos house main ghamaasan much gaya tha
 Siddharth Shukla and Paras Chhabra had a fierce debate as Paras boiled the eggs more and broke them
 isaki vajah yah bhi he ki abhi tak andon ko pani main daalkar hi ubala jaataa rahaa he
 But a fun way to boil eggs on Tiktok is going viral
 andey ubaalane ke is viral video main aap dekhenge ki andon ko pani main daalkar nahin, balki geeli mitti main gole banaakar ubala ja rahaa he
 First took wet soil, gave it round shape like a dough, then put the egg in the middle and covered it completely with soil
 thik vaise hi jaise bharva paranthe banaae jate hai
 After covering the eggs with soil, place them on the stove over the stove with wood
 kuch der baad andon se mitti ko hataaya, pani main dhoyaa or phir plate main andon ke do tukade kar sarv kar diya
 This unique style of grinding lentils that went viral on tiktok, would not have seen such a unique experience of grinding lentils on tiktok before it became viral
 is tiktaoc video main aap dekhenge ki ghar ke baahar bane chabutare ko sil or bade pathar ke aakaar ke batte se chane kii daal pisi ja rahi he

 kashmir par sarvadaleey pratinidhimandal ke lautne ke baad dilli main hui baithak main sabhi is baat par sahamat hue ki desh kii samprabhutaa se koi samjhauta nahin hoga
 At the same time, negotiations have been reached with all the parties involved in this issue
 4 or 5 sitambar ko kashmir daure ke dauraan civil socity, raajnneetik dalon or sarkari adhikariyon kii dailygation ke saath tamaam masalon par baatcheet hui
 During this time many problems related to the state were revealed
 kashmir par sarvadaleey pratinidhimandal ke daure main ye bade mudde saamne aae
 Know what will happen to the state
 
 
 1
 Demand for secretariat camp in Jammu will have effect: Jammu city is the winter capital of Jammu and Kashmir
 ghati main aae din hone vaale virodh-pradarshan kii vajah se sarkaar kaa kaamkaaj thap ho jaataa he
 The violence in the valley has stalled government operations for the last two months
 dailygation ke daure par sachivalay kaa permanent camp karyaalay banaae jane kii maang uthi
 In such a situation, if a camp office is set up in Jammu, then the government work will continue normally
 2
 Demand for UT status for leh-ladakh will have an impact: On the tour of delegation, demand for Union Territory status to leh-ladakh region also arose
 jammu-kashmir ke ladakh ko 'barfila registan' bhi kaha jaataa he
 Leh here has a Buddhist majority population while Kargil has 99% Muslim population
 is ilaake ko centreshasit pradesh kaa darja die jane se yahaan khud kaa prashasnic dhaancha taiyaar ho sakegaa
 69 of Jammu and Kashmir
 6 fisadi hisse main faile ladakh rigen ko alag bhu-raajnneetik or bhu-saanskrithik pahchaan mil sakegaa
 3
 jammu-kashmir ke alpsankhyakon kii chintaaen saamne inye hoga asar:jammu-kashmir ke alpsankhyak hinduon par atyaachaar kii khabaren aati rahi hai
 Concerns were raised about the defense of their interests during the delegation visit
 rajya main hindu alpsankhyak hai ormuslim bahusankhyakhain, iske baavjood rajya main 68 fisadi muslimon ko hi alpsankhyak ke tahat laabh mil rahe hai, jabaki vastav main hinduon ko yah suvidhaayen milani chahie
 For the last 50 years, there has been no enumeration of minorities in the state nor constituted Minorities Commission
 isliye jammu kashmir ke liye alpsankhyak or essi / asti ayog banaae jane kii maang uthi ki alpsankhyak ayog banaaya janaa jaruri he
 4
 lavaanaa sikh samudaay ko obisi kaa darja die jane kii mangayah hoga asar:punjab main labaanaa sikh samudaay koobisi kaa darjamila hua he, lekin jammu-kashmir main is samudaay ke logon ko yah darja nahin hasil he
 Because of this, this step is necessary to bring the people of this community into the mainstream of the society
 rajya main pahadiyon ko anusuchit janajati kaa darja die jane kii maang bhi uthi he
 5
 alpsankhyakon ko emelsi, rajyasabha kaa maukaayah hoga asar:alpsankhyak samudaay ke netaaon ko governor kii ore se vidhaan parishad sadsy, rajyasabha sadsy ke taur par namit kiye jane kii maang uthi he
 This will help the people of this community to become part of the democratic process
 6
 The demand for local bodies and panchayat elections will arise: Panchayat elections are an important part of the democratic process
 jammu-kashmir main 37 saal ke antaraal ke baad 2011 main panchayat chunaav hue the or panchayaton kaa kaarykaal 17 july, 2016 ko puraa ho gaya
 Similarly, urban local body elections were held in 2005 after a gap of 26 years in the princely state and the term was completed in 2010
 pichley chah saal senikaay chunaavalatakate aa rahe hai
 During the governor's rule in the state from January 8 to April 3, 2016, preparations were made to hold elections in the first week of May, but the law and order situation is not currently electionable
 ab dailygation ke daure se ummid bandhi he ki sthaneey nikaay ke chunaav kii taiyaariyon par kaam shuru hoga
 People traveling by auto in Delhi are going to get hit by inflation

 Last week, the Transport Department of Delhi released a new rate of auto rickshaw fare
 haalanki tab kuch adhikariyon ne is adhisuchana kaa virodh kiya tha or kaha tha ki adhisuchana jari karne ke liye alji ke anumati kii jarurat hogi
 Eventually this notification was issued after the permission of Transport Minister Kailash Gehlot
 isse pehle parivahan mantralay ne kanoon vibhaag se raay lekar bataaya tha ki kiraaya badhaane ke liye alji ke parmishan kii jarurat nahin he
 The case of Arnav Duggal, found dead in his girlfriend's house in Delhi, is still unresolved
 police ke haath abhi tak koi ahm suraag nahin lag paaya he
 However, the police is busy collecting evidence related to this case
 ab police ko arnav kii postmortem kaa report kaa intjaar he
 When the Arnav Duggalki corpse was found by the police in the room of the Shakuntala apartment in Dwarka, Delhi, no suicide note was also found there
 haalanki police ne puure kamare kii jaanch padtaal kii or saboot jutaney kii koshish kii gai
 According to the police, Arnav's body was hanging on the noose for about three hours
 police adhikariyon ke mutabik is maamle kii jaanch gambhirtha kii ja rahi he
 Whether it is a case of suicide or murder, investigation is going on from both these aspects
 police ke mutabik itnaa to saaf he ki aakhri vakt main uski dost uske saath vahaan maujuud thi
 Police said that they had received information about this death at 6 pm on the 13th
 ab police ye tay kar lenaa chaahati he ki is cese se jude sabooton ke saath koi chhedchhad na kii jaae
 In this case, the post-mortem report will play an important role, so the police is now waiting for the same report
 saath hi police ne is cese se jude saare gavaahon ke bayaan bhi record kar liye hai
 According to the police, in the initial investigation, this case seems to be of suicide
 bataate chalem ki arnav apane chaar doston ke saath 12 june kii raat party ke liye ghar se niklaa tha
 He went home with his car
 raat main in sab ne sharaab pi thi
 Eventually, Arnav and his friends were left alone
 wo ladki dwarka ke shakuntla apartment main rahati he
 Arnav reached the girl's house around 7 am on the morning of 13 June
 ladki apane ghar pahunch gai lekin iske baavjood arnav lagaataar use phone karata rahaa
 Troubled, the girl picked up the phone and asked Arnav to come home
 uske baad arnav ladki ke ghar pahunch gaya tha
 Going to the girl's house, Arnav slept in another room while the girl was sleeping in her room
 shaam ko kareeb 4 baje ladki uthi to usne duusare kamare main jaakar dekha ki arnav ne faansee laga lee he
 Seeing the scene of the room, she got very nervous
 iske baad usne apane pita ko phone kiya
 Her father works in rkpuram
 ghatana ke vakt ladki kii mata or uskaa bhai bihar ke purniya gaye hue the
 After calling the father, the girl came out of the house and sat in the stairs
 uske pita ko ghar aane main takreeban 2 ghante kaa vakt laga
 At that time, even a friend called her friend and called her at home
 donon ladkiyaan ghar ke baahar sidhiyon par baithi rahi
 For this reason, it is being said that Arnav's body kept hanging on the noose for about 3 hours
 disipi surendra ne bataaya ki ladki ke pita ne police ko phone kiya
 Police informed Arnav's family about the incident over phone
 jaanch main pataa chalaa ki arnav self maid ladkaa tha
 He earned himself from class XII onwards and did not take any money from the family
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki jis ladki ke ghar main vaardaat hui vah usee se ek tarafa pyaar karata tha
 But the girl was not interested in him
 isi vajah se shuruaati taur par police maanakar chal rahi he ki yahi arnav kii aatmahatya kaa kaaran tha

 @ tsrawatbjp @ ronniescrewvala — Abhishek Kapoor (@abhishekapoor) December 8, 2018 Though the state government has not imposed any official ban on the film, it has sent a written message to all the district collectors of the state about the film and the controversies surrounding it
 yah nirnay mukhyamantri trivendra singh ravat kii adhyakshata main hui baithak main liya gaya tha
 a report presented on the film was reviewed by a committee headed by Tourism Minister Satpal Maharaj
 sarkaar ne ise jila prashasan par chhod diya ki film ko unke sambandhit adhikaar kshetra main relies kiya janaa chahie yaa nahin
 Subsequently, the film was banned in Dehradun, Haridwar, Pauri, Tehri, Nainital, Almora and Udham Singh Nagar
 yah film varsh 2013 main kedarnath main baadh se machi tabaahi par kendrit he
 The film was shot in the hill state
 dakshinpanthi iskaa virodh kar rahe hai or unka aarope he ki yah hindu bhaawanaaon ko aahat karti he or 'lav jehad' ko badhaava detii he
 The Uttarakhand High Court on Thursday refused to ban the film and asked the petitioners to contact the district magistrates
 bataa den film ne box offis par behtareen pradarshan kiya he, do din main takreeban 17 karod rupee kii kamai kar lee he
 Saran Ali Khansara said on the ban- We shot the film in Uttarakhand
 ham vahaan par 40 dinon ke liye ruke
 i spent beautiful moments of my life there
 us jagah ne mujhe bahut kuch diya he
 i am sorry that i have not been able to return this love to the people there
 sara ne aage kaha- jati or dharm ke aadhaar par bantwaaraa hona galat he
 The film gives the message of connecting together, rather than dividing
 mujhe nahin lagata ki logon ko thes kaise pahunch rahi he
 i don't think people who are saying so have seen the film
 bharat or china main pichley kuch dinon se tanatani badi he
 Dragon is constantly reminding India of the 1962 war, while India is also accusing India of breaking the Panchsheel agreement
 duusari ore bharat kii ore se bhi is maamle main is baar naram tevar nahin dikhaae gaye hai
 There have also been strong statements from China on behalf of many ministers from the government
 raksha mantri arun jetali ne kaha tha ki china ko yaad rakhaa chahie ki ab 1962 jaise halaat nahin he
 No matter how much tension is on the border, it is not so easy for China to wage war with India again or show eye for more days
 samajhie aakhir kyon
 
 
 1
 china kaa sabase bada bazaar bharatbharat china kaa sabase bada bazaar he
 For the past several years, imports from China have increased in India, although there has been a slight decrease in exports from India
 donon deshon ke bich main 2016-17 tak lagbhag 71
 18 billion dollar business, of which China currently 59 to India
 43 arab dollar ke saamaan kaa salanaa niryaat karata he, jo yahaan ke kul aayaat kaa 13 fisadi ke aasapaas hota he
 According to central government data, as of March 2017, China has 4 in India
 91 arab dollar kaa nivesh kiya he
 It is clear that if China tries to spoil relations with India, then its trade will be greatly affected
 2
 America's relations with India and the United States have been strong for a long time and China has also had problems with this friendship
 yah kai maukon par saamne bhi aayaa he
 Recently there was also a statement from China that India is showing eyes to China only because of US President Donald Trump
 donald trump bhi lagaataar america first kii baat karte hai, jiskaa sidhaa asar china par bhi pad saktaa he
 Because many Chinese companies are spread all over the world, if the relations with india-us deteriorate, then the global market that China cherishes may be in danger
 3
 The impact on many companies is that India is the largest market in China
 china kii companiyaan bhi bharat main ahm bhoomika nibhaati hai, or badi sankhya main bharat main apana saamaan bechati hai
 These companies include big companies like Lenovo, Haier, Hawaii, TCL, Oppo, Vivo
 4
 Mobile, TV, charger, memory card and music equipment are the most important items we import from China
 iske alaava bartan, auto essessories, building material, senetary item, kichan item, tiles, mashine, ingine, pump, chemical, fertilizer, aayran evam steel, plastic, boat or medical acupment shaamil hai
 5
 ab bharat kii sena main bhi he damayah saaf he ki ab bharat or china ke halaat 1962 jaise nahin he
 India has become a very strong country, India's strength in military matters has also increased
 china bhi bharat kii brahros missile se darataa he
 Apart from this, India's strength has also increased
 global fire power dot com ke mutabik china kii vayusena ke paas kul 2,955 aircraft hai
 Out of this, there are a total of 912 helicopters including 1,271 fighter aircraft, 1,385 attack aircraft, 782 transport aircraft, 352 trainer air craft, 206 attack helicopters, while India has 676 fighter aircraft, 809 attack aircraft, 857 transport aircraft, 323 trainer aircraft, 16 attack
 There are a total of 666 helicopters including choppers
 thal sena kii baat karen to china ke paas duniya kii sabase badi sena he
 China has 22 lakh 85 thousand armed soldiers, and 5 lakh 10 thousand reserve soldiers
 yahi nahin, ardhsainik balon ke rup main china ke paas 6 lakh 60 hajaar sainik hai
 At the same time, India has 6,457 battle tanks, 4,788 armored fighting vehicles, 1,710 automatic vehicles and 1,770 rocket projectors

 China launched its biggest destroyer Type-055 on Wednesday
 iske mukaable bharat ke paas teen aircraft karier, 14 yudhpot, 11 vidhvansak, 23 jangi jahaaj, 15 pandubbi, 139 petrol craft or chah mine warfare pot hai
 India is ahead of China in terms of aircraft carriers
 aakhir kin-kin vivaadon par aamane-saamne he china -- sikkim ilaake ko lekar border par tanaav- bhutan vivaad main bharat kaa teesraa paksh hona- enesji: bharat enesji group main entry kii koshish karata rahaa he lekin china ne lagaataar iskaa virodh kiya
 - While India has always opposed the growing terrorism on behalf of Pakistan in India, China has always defended Pakistan
 - china-pakistan aarthik coridor (CPEC) main pok ke hisse ko lekar bharat kaa virodh- bharat or china ke bich brahmaputra nadi ko lekar bhi vivaad he
 Actually, by building a dam here, China is diverting all the water towards it which India has been opposing continuously
 - dalai lamas or tibet vivambhi seemaa par kya hai halaat?bhartiya seemaa main avaidh ghuspaith or uske baad nakshe main sikkim ko apana hissaa bataane par china ke saath tanaav ke halaat charam par hai
 India said on one side that we are not in the situation of 1962, China should not consider us weak
 vahiin china ne kaha- hamen bhi 1962 vaala china mat samajhie
 Chinese media said - we can go to the level of war to save our land
 is ilaake main donon taraf sainik bheje gaye hai
 Here the troops sent by India to Dokala are deployed in non-combative mode

 ek dhamaakaa to kar diya he, doosraa aktubar main karuunga
 Mahipal Maderna, former minister in the Ashok Gehlot government, jailed on charges of Bhanwari Devi sex scandal and murder, said something like this after the victory of the family in the recent elections of the cooperative bank of Jodhpur, then the Jat politics of the state Indicated to turn
 mahipal maderna kii patni lila maderna is chunaav main adhyaksh to jail main baithe mahipal upaadhyaksh chune gaye
 The entire governing board headed by this family was elected unopposed
 satta ke gathan main nirnaayak jat vot ke mahatv ne siyaasi dalon main halchal machaa di
 The Maderna family is marginalized and is actually a big political house in the state, which has been active in the state's politics since 1952
 isaki rishtedaariyaan bhi apni hi kadalathi jaise gharaanon main hai, jinaki pahunch congress alaakaman tak he
 At the time of Maderna's arrest in the Bhanwari Devi episode, a large number of supporters who took to the streets had shown the importance of this family's hold on Jat politics
 aise parivaar kaa siyaasi phayda koun nahin uthaanaa chahega? khaskar jab rajya main isi saal vidhansabha chunaav hone hai
 MP of Dausa and P
 e
 State President of Sangma's National People's Party (NPP), Dr
 kirodilal meena to maderna parivaar se kai mulaakaaten kar chuke hai
 But due to Mahipal being in jail, Leela is still not opening the leaves
 ve in mulakaaton ko aupchaarikta kaa jama pahanaati hai
 While Meena says openly, "mahipalji is in jail, but his family is welcome in our party
" ’’ bijepi ke purv pradesh adhyaksh or vartmaan main upaadhyaksh arun chaturvedi sahit varisht netaa rajendrasingh rathod bhi maderna or unke parivaar se mulaakaat kar chuke hai
 Are bjp's doors open for Maderna? In response, Chaturvedi says, "the party has not thought about it yet
" mai to shishtachar ke naate milane gaya tha
 "the BJP does not want to open the cards for fear of reversing the stakes, as the communities associated with Bhanwari Devi may get upset
" haalanki darasingh prakaran main giraftaar ke baad rathod jail main maderna vaali cell main hi rahe
 Both of them spent many days together from eating to talking
 jail se baahar aane ke baad rathod lagaataar maderna parivaar ke sampark main rahe
 Although the BJP is calling these meetings a courtesy call, but there is a famous saying in politics, the enemy's enemy is a friend
 rathod-maderna ko ek hi ‘‘jaadugar’’ (rajya main ashok gahalot ko mili oopaadhi) se peedit mana jaataa he
 One of the main reasons for Maderna family's growing pangs with the BJP is that when Mahipal was isolated in his own party Congress at the time of the Bhanwari Devi episode, the opposition BJP did not target Gehlot government at the time
 bhavishya kii ranneeti ke tahat party ne aisa koi kadam nahin uthaaya jo maderna or uske parivaar ko chubhe
 This is the reason that BJP and Maderna are likely to step in
 haalanki congress chaahati he ki maderna parivaar kaa kisi duusare dal ke saath gathjod na hone paae kyonki is parivaar kaa prabhaav puure pradesh main he
 Especially on Jat multiplicity seats
 isliye congress ne andruni report ke aadhaar par paali loksabhaa seat se chunaav ke liye divya maderna kaa naam ummidavaaron ke panel main maanga he
 But on the hustle of going to other party of Maderna family, State Congress President Dr
 chandrabhan kehete hai, ‘‘maderna parivaar congress kaa sachcha sevak he
 "but Maderna's daughter Divya Maderna says," a political conspiracy was played against us
 jisase pradesh kaa kisaan varg congress se naaraaz he or iskaa asar dur tak jayega
 "currently, the Maderna family is talking about opening their cards two months before the elections
" isaki vajah bhi maderna kaa jail main hona he
 If this family takes any big step at this time, then Maderna may come out of jail and become complicit
 divya kahati hai, ‘‘philhal hamaara puraa dhyaan cese par laga hua he
 "obviously, if Maderna gets bail before the elections, his role in these elections will be very important
" vahiin agar divya maderna aage kii pari khelti hai to bhi jail main baithe maderna kii bhoomika ahm hogi

 unhone kaha ki vipaksh raajnneetik bahes nahin karnaa chahta he or vikaas ke mudde ko bhatkaana chahta he
 The Congress party knows that the work done in the Modi government in the last 5 years has not been done in the 50-55 years of Congress rule
 usko pataa he ki agar vikaas ke mudde par bahes hogi, to isse congress party ko dikkat hogi
 During this, Nitin Gadkari countered the abuses given by the opposition to Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 unhone kaha ki desh kaa pradhanmantri kisi party kaa nahin hota he, balki puure raashtra kaa hota he
 However, it is unfortunate that the opposition against Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said so much wrong that Rahul Gandhi has had to apologize
 unhone kaha, 'ab tak vipaksh pradhanmantri narendra modi ko chappan baar gaaliyaan de chukaa he, lekin ye hamaare liye chappan gaaliyaan nahin, balki chappan bhoga hai
 The opposition's agenda is only to instill fear on minorities, Dalits and tribals
 'is bich bhartiya janata party ke purv adhyaksh nitin gadakari ne modi sarkaar kii paanch saal ke kaamkaaj kii jamkar tarif kii
 He said, 'the work that we have done in five years, the Congress has not been able to do even in 50 years
 lihaaja uske paas koi mudda nahin he
 'union Minister Gadkari said that we are contesting this Lok Sabha election on the basis of our 5 years of functioning
 kendriya mantri ne kaha, 'congress party apni vishwasaneeyata kho chuki he
 Former Prime Ministers Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi and Manmohan Singh even talked about removing poverty from the country, but could not remove poverty
 ab rahul gandhi 72 hajaar rupee dekar garibi hataane kii baat kah rahe hai
 Gadkari said that the Congress party is talking about doing justice by giving 72 thousand rupees, but it cannot do justice to the poor, because justice must first have credibility
 ab congress kii vishwasaniyat nahin rahi
 Nitin Gadkari's statement came at a time when voting has been held for the five phases of the Lok Sabha
 ab chhathwein or saatven charan ke matdaan hone hai
 The results of the election will be released after the May 23 counting
 ganga safai kaa zikr karte hue nitin gadakari ne kaha, 'hamane jalmaarg banaaya, to congress mahasachiv priyanka gandhi wadra prayagraj se banaras tak jalmaarg se gayi
 We cleaned the Ganges, then they drank the Ganges three times
 unhone jalmaarg se yatra karne ke saath hi modi sarkaar kii aalochana kii
 Talking about the anti-sikh riot, Gadkari said that the victims of the 1984 anti-sikh riot could not get justice and the Congress honored the accused instead of giving justice to the victims
 congress sikh virdohi danga ke peediton ko ab tak nyaay nahin de pai he
 In such a situation, how will the Congress give justice to the people of the country? Taking a dig at the Congress, Gadkari said, 'the ideology of the Congress party is responsible for the country's plight
 congress ne desh kii jo durdasha kii he, usko piem modi ne apane tareeke se janata ko bataaya he
 It should be seen as ideas
 yah koi vyaktigat aarope nahin he
 Nitin Gadkari said, 'rahul Gandhi and the entire opposition together decide after 23rd, who will be their Prime Minister? In this too, the matter will be clear
 piem modi or bijepi ke khilaaf vipakshi ekta par gadakari ne kaha ki ye vipaksh ke sohardpurn ekta kaa puraa shrey bijepi ko jaataa he
 These people have started making excuses before the election defeat
 'nitin gadakari ne kaha ki jab saal 1971 main pakistan se ladaai hui thi, to atal bihari vaajapeyi vipaksh ke netaa the
 However, when it came to national interest, he stood with the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi
 haalanki jab bhartiya vayusena ne balakot air strike kii, to congress party ne sawaal uthaae
 He said that differences in politics are understandable, but discrimination is not understood
 bharat kii janata jaagruk he
 The people of this country will take a decision after thinking everything

 He said, 'we are part of the UPA and we will go together

 His remarks came at a time when it was claimed in a news that Sangma would be the NCP candidate in the next presidential election
 ab pataa yah chal rahaa he ki 11 disambar ko aae jin chunaav nateezon ne shivaraj singh chouhan ko madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri kii kursi se bedakhal kar diya tha, ve un siyaasi jhatkon kii shuruyaat bhar the jo bhartiya janata party ke is diggaj netaa kaa intjaar kar rahe the
 Within two days of the mandate, Chauhan declared that he was not going anywhere and would continue in the state's politics
 unhone kaha ki ve jald hi puure rajya kii 'aabhaar yatra' par niklenge
 But his intentions were soon rekindled when the central leadership asked him to give it a try
 phir khabar ai ki ve vipaksh kaa netaa banane ke liye taiyaar hai
 This position eventually went into the bag of former minister Gopal Bhargava (who is not considered close to him)
 phir chaihaan ne bhaajapa pradesh adhyaksh banane main dilchaspee dikhaai
 But a day before the national executive meeting in Delhi, Chauhan was surprised to see that he had been made the national vice president along with former chief ministers who had lost elections in the other two states — Vasundhara Raje of Rajasthan and Raman Singh of Chhattisgarh
 kendriya netritv kii taraf se sandesh saaf thah chouhan ab or apana manachaaha hasil nahin kar sakenge
 Chauhan had ruled as chief minister for 13 years and during this period managed to reduce the stature of many emerging political rivals
 par ab pratidwandvi unke khilaaf golband ho rahe hai or har mode par unhen maat de rahe hai
 How will Chauhan get out of this chakravyuh? Political experts of the state believe that swords have come out of the sheath against Chauhan
 sabko pataa he ki pradesh ke purv mukhyamantri bhaajapa ke maujuuda kendriya netritv narendra modi-amit shah kii jodi ke pasandida nahin hai
 Chauhan had almost assured him that he is the best bet for him before the election
 magar ab ve siyaasi taur par najaron se utar chuke lagate hai—baavjood iske ki madhya pradesh main party ne behtareen pradarshan kiya, jisamen usne congress se vaaki kahin zyada vot hasil kiye or 230 sadasyon kii vidhansabha main congress kii 114 siton ke mukaable 109 siton ke saath behad maamuli antar se bahumat hasil karne se chook gai
 They have little choice: they can contest the Lok Sabha elections and if the BJP again wins and forms the government at the Center, they can remain relevant as ministers (their good relations with the RSS can confirm this)
 doosraa vikalp yah hoga ki ve rajya kii siyasat main hi rahen or congress ke bahut maamuli bahumat ko dekhte hue uski sarkaar ko asthir karne kii koshish karen
 If they succeed in this, then they can get the position of Chief Minister but it will not be easy
 aisa karne vaale ko camel nath or digvijay sareekhe diggaj netaaon kaa muqabla karnaa hoga jo is khel ke puraane ustad hai
 The third option before Chauhan is that he should work for the BJP to win Madhya Pradesh in the next elections, whenever he is
 isamen unhone dilchaspee jaahir bhi kii he
 For this, you have to work hard, travel a lot and meet people
 magar shivaraj singh chouhan sabase zyada isi kaam ke liye utsuk hai kyonki yah sab ve bahut sahajata se kar pate hai
 He may be out of power, but his intention is to remain in the hearts and minds of the people and frequent trips are part of his efforts to remain relevant
 magar kabhi-kabhi mansoobey ulate pad jate hai
 The same happened on January 18 when Chauhan hurried to Mandsaur to protest the assassination of Prahlad Bandhwar, the president of the local municipality and to attack the Congress government against the collapse of law and order in the state — then the middle way He came to know that the accused is the leader of his own party
 is bich unhen khud apni party ke bheetar se chunauti kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 Union minister Narendra Singh Tomar, who was once his colleague, former minister in the state government Narottam Mishra, BJP general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya, state president Rakesh Singh, above all vice-president Prabhat Jha, all seem to have a common agenda to keep Chauhan out
 ek or ghatana jo bahut-kuch kahati he, yah he ki chouhan ke jansampark or press note kaa kaam ab ek alag team sambhaal rahi he or rajya bhaajapa daftar se us team kaa koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 Staying out of power and staying relevant is a tremendous challenge for most leaders
 aagaamee loksabhaa chunaav ke nattejey behad ahm honge
 This is well known to both the party's central leadership and those influenced by its decisions
 ththbhajapa kii akeli ummid abhi tak yahi he ki aguai kii kaman nae haathon main saunpane ke saath hi vasundhara raaje ke khilaaf satta virdohi bhaavana loksabhaa chunaavon tak chhomantar ho jaaegi
 Not only this, BJP has no plan how to use the former Rajasthan Chief Minister

 She was addressing party workers in her constituency Jhalrapatan
 yah jhalawad-baran sansadeey kshetra main aata he, jahaan se unke bete dushyant singh teen baar se saansad hai or is baar bhi unke chunaav ladgaye kii ummid kii ja rahi he
 It is discussed that Raje will be asked to contest general elections so that he can be removed from the state politics, but he has tried his best to dismiss such rumors on his part
 raaje apane bete ke nirvachan kshetra kaa daura karti rahi hai or unhone ek kism se chunaav prachaar bhi shuru kar diya he
 He took the swine flu which took the lives of 100 people and caused the death of 10 farmers due to cold wave (former chief minister alleges that these deaths occurred because the government provided electricity for irrigation in the fields at night when the temperature was very good Decline had come) attacked the new Congress government
 kayaas hai ki party raaje ko loksabhaa chunaav ladvana chaahati he
 This would mean that Dushyant may have to lose his ticket
 ek or dhada maanata he ki agar bhaajapa loksabhaa kaa chunaav jitati he to raaje ko centre sarkaar main shaamil hone ke liye kaha ja saktaa he
 This seems more likely, especially when big ministers like Sushma Swaraj, Arun Jaitley and Manohar Parrikar are not doing well
 magar raaje apane bete dushyant ko mantri banane par jor de sakati hai
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi had rejected his wish for the last time being his chief minister himself
 to bhaajapa raaje kaa istemaal bhala kaise kar sakati he? chunavi haar ke baad party ne abhi tak unhen nepathy tak simit rakhane kii koshish kii he

 ab jab rathod vipaksh ke upanetaa hai, party shekhavat ko rajya adhyaksh ke pad par nahin laa sakegi kyonki loksabhaa chunaav kaaphi najadik hai

 With elections approaching, the BJP will have to take into account their impact on voters and their grip on legislators

 Sources close to Raman say that even after the defeat, the party's attitude with him is not as strict as it has been with Shivraj Singh Chauhan in Madhya Pradesh
 ve daawa karte hai ki rajya bhaajapa adhyaksh dharmlaal kowshik ko unheen ke kehane par vipaksh kaa netaa banaaya gaya he or loksabhaa chunaav se pehle jab nae rajya adhyaksh kii niyukti kii jaaegi tab bhi unheen kii suni jaaegi
 While Chauhan is visiting Madhya Pradesh, Raman is in a relaxed posture

 Roughly 50 per cent of the voters in the state come from OBC communities — Kurmi, Sahu and Yadav communities are prominent

 The England cricket team will now resort to chanting to prevent the Indian cricket team from capturing the five-match ODI series

 According to the newspaper 'daily Telegraph', the committee has admitted that the round of chanting was started by their team in Mohali in their attempt to dismiss Virat Kohli and Gautam Gambhir during the second match played in Delhi

 For this reason, we will now use sparring, as this tactic can work to make Indian players uncomfortable
 unhone kaha,bharat main khelte hue koi bhi videshi team bhartiya team ke khilaaf chhintakashi kaa prayog karne se ghabraati he, lekin ham aisa karenge

 Kohli said, when Australian players get frustrated they splatter
 nishchit rup se krij par kaaphi garm maahaul tha
 They were constantly scolding the players for distracting them
 ’ kohli ne 116 ran kii pari khel kar bharat ko chauthe or antim test ke tisare din pehali pari main 272 ran banane main madad kii
 He said, 'during the partnership between Mary and Wriddhiman Saha, they were doing a lot of splattering
 ’ maidan par ek aisa bhi kshan aayaa jab kohli austrailian ben hilphenhas ke saath shabdic jang main ulajh gayi the, iske baad vah ran out se bache
 He said, 'hilfenhaus told me something which was absolutely unnecessary
 pataa nahin vah kahaan se aa gaya jabaki vah gendbaaji bhi nahin kar rahaa tha
 i avoided being run out for 99 runs
 usne mujhe kuch aise shabd kahe the jise main press conferes main nahin bataa saktaa
 'kohli told reporters,' i also told him that you have nothing to do with it, so why are you doing this
 ’kohli ne jo kuch kiya, unhen iskaa bilkul bhi pachhtaawaa nahin he
 He said, 'both Ishant and i started speaking back and got overwhelmed which caused a lot of flare up
 main aamtaur par aise hi cricket kheltaa hum
 i am happy with everything i did
 ’ riki ponting ko bich bachaav ke liye aana padaa or kohli ko is purv austrailian captain ne khinchakar is bahes se dur kiya jisase halaat thode shant ho gayi
 Kohli said, 'ponting told me that i don't answer him or else i would have trouble in vain
 usne sachmuch meri madad kii
 'ed Cowan and David Warner said angry words to Kohli and Ishant in Perth, but they did not say anything to this young batsman
 unhone kaha, ‘usne mujhe badhai di
 Both of them did the same
 donon ne kuch nahin kaha
 In Sydney, he was behind me because i was not scoring and here i scored a century
 ’ sidney main duusare test ke dauraan kohli ne darshakon ko madhyam ungali dikhaayi thi jiske liye un par match fees kaa 50 pratishat jurmaana laga tha
 Kohli said, 'you have to answer literally
 aisa karke shatak jadna behatar he
 We do not go to hear any kind of talk from any (audience) on the field
 ham antarrashtriya cricketer hai
 We did not come just for participation in it
 unhen yah baat janani hogi or hamen unhen bolkar or apane pradarshan se yah baat bataani hogi
 'he said,' It gets quite frustrating sometimes
 ve aisi chijen kehete hai jo cricket maidan par nahin kehani chahie
 We go to play on the field, not to listen to anyone's abuse
 agar ve cricket kaa lutf uthaane aaye hai to unhen aisa karnaa chahie
 Neither should the players be abused by drinking alcohol
 yah khilaadiyon ke prati thik vyavhaar nahin he

 darshak kuch bhi kahkar apane ghar ja sakate hai
 It should be in a proper way
 ’ In summer, the thing that appeals to everyone is 'water'
 is chilchilaate garmiyon ke mausam main enjoy karne kaa sabase best idia ye he kisi aisi jagah trip par jaaen, jahaan kai tarah ke water sports maujuud hon
 So that you can enjoy your trip to the fullest, but do you know which are the places that can prove to be the best 'summer destination' for you in terms of water sports
 
 
 scuba diving If you are a water sports enthusiast then you must do scuba diving once in your life
 scuba diving ke best experions ke liye aapako andaman kaa rukh karnaa chahie
 Here you will get full enjoyment of this adventure sport
 under water walk Mauritius is one of the best destinations for holidaying and traveling around the world, but if you want to 'walk under water sea', then you will get the best experience in Mauritius
 yakeen maniye samudr kii gaharaai main chalane kaa majaa sabase niraala or yaadgaar hoga
 Rafting jinhen adventure se kuch zyada hi pyaar he to rafting jaisaa water sport unheen ke liye bana he
 If you want to enjoy white water rafting, then you should pack your bags for rishikesh
 ganga ke thanda pani aapako puri tarah se rifresh kar degaa or rapid main uchhalati raft adventure karne kii sari kasar puri kar degi
 scuba diving agar aap water sports ke divaane hai to aapako apni life main ek baar scuba diving jarur kerani chahie
 For the best experience of scuba diving, you should turn to Andaman
 yahaan aapako is adventure sport kaa puraa majaa mil sakegaa
 Under water walk morishas duniya bhar main chhuttiyaan manaane or ghoomane-phirane ke lihaaj se sabase acchhee destinations main se ek he, lekin agar aap 'under water si walk' karnaa chaahate hai to iskaa best experions aapako morishas main hi milegaa
 Believe that the fun of walking in the depths of the sea will be most unique and memorable
 rafting For those who love adventure more then water sports like rafting are made for them only
 white water rafting kaa majaa lenaa he to iske liye aapako rishikesh ke liye apane bag pack karne chahie
 The cool water of the Ganges will refresh you completely and the rafting in the rapid will complete all the tasks of adventure
 kerala main left or congress ke alaava bijepi bhi ek mahatvapurn raajnneetik party ke taur par ubhar rahi he
 By the way, the BJP had made its presence as a political party in Kerala in the 1987 Assembly elections
 lekin is baar vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi ne puri takat jhonk di he
 86-year-old o Rajagopal has fielded his veteran leader in the party
 rajagopal kii aguwai main safalataa kii ummidbijapi rajagopal kii jeet ke saath kerala main party kii pakad ko majboot karnaa chaahati he
 However, Rajagopal was expected to win in the 2011 assembly elections
 lekin 6400 voton se haar gaye
 In a way, the 2011 assembly elections showed the way forward for the BJP, because the party did not win a single seat, but the increase in vote percentage gave a fillip to the party
 bijepi ko ummid he ki is baar o rajagopal ke netritv main party ko karishmai safalataa milegi
 The party has fielded 86-year-old Rajagopal from the Nemom assembly seat
 jan sangh ke daur main party se jude rajagopalo rajagopal kaa janm 15 sitambar 1929 ko kerala ke palakkad main hua he
 He graduated from Government Victoria College, Palakkad
 inaki patni kaa naam shantha kumari he
 Rajagopal has a son named Shyamaprasad
 rajagopal dinadayal upaadhyaay kii nitiyon se prabhavit hokar 1960 main bhartiya jansangh se judakar raajnneeti main kadam rakhaa
 Before joining politics, Rajagopal was known as a lawyer
 jansangh kaa daaman thamte hi party ne inhen rajya kaa pradesh adhyaksh bana diya
 He first contested the Lok Sabha elections in 1980
 chunaav main haar hui
 Rajagopal has so far contested the Lok Sabha elections from Kerala 6 times but has not been successful
 atal sarkaar main mili thi ahm jimmedaarihar main rajagopal kii apni jeet ko dekhte hai
 Despite the defeat, they remained extremely close to the public
 jis vajah se saal-dar-saal kerala main bijepi kii vot fisadi main badhotaree hui
 Rajagopal has been very close to Atal Bihari Vajpayee
 jisaki vajah se ye kai mantripad se navaaje gaye
 He was also made Minister of State during the NDA government
 rajagopal 1992 se 2004 tak madhya pradesh se rajyasabha saansad rahe
 He was also locked in bars during the Emergency
 nikaay chunaav main jeet se bijepi utsahitpichley kuch saalon main kerala kii dharti par bijepi kii neenv majboot hui he
 In the same sequence, the BJP won a big victory in the local body elections held in Kerala last year
 kerala main united democratic front ke garh main sendhamari karte hue bijepi ne tiruvanantpuram nagar nigam kii 100 siton main se 33 siton par jeet hasil kii
 While the Left Democratic Front (LDF) captured 42 seats
 bijepi ne 17 gram panchayaton or ek nagarnigam par kabja karne ke alaava kai pocket vaardon main bhi siten hasil kin
 The rss's grip at the grassroots in Kerala is also alarmed by the bjp's rise
 kyonki pichley vidhansabha chunaav main kai siton par apni vot fisadi se bijepi ne logon ko chaunkaaya tha
 Also, in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP was successful in improving its position
 2011 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main bijepi ko 6 fisadi vot mili the jabaki 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main badhkar 10 fisadi tak ho gai
 More important, the BJP was successful in challenging the Congress leader Shashi Tharoor in Thiruvananthapuram
 vahiin duusari ore kerala main aresas kii pakad behad majboot he or isi ko bijepi is baar bhunaane main juty he
 The BJP is also seen playing the Hindutva card very aggressively this time in Kerala
 bihar main pichley kuch dinon main ek ke baad ek aisi kai ghatnaayen hui hai jinase lagata he ki mukhyamantri nitish kumaar kaa ab shashan or prashasan par niyantran nahin rahaa
 In most of the cases, the departments related to which incidents have taken place are the incidents of Home or Jail departments under the Chief Minister
 lekin sabase chaunkaane vaali baat yah he ki pehle kisi ghatana ke baad kii karrwai se nitish kumaar apane prashasan kii dhak dikhaate the lekin ab wo tatparta or ichhashakti in ghatnaon ke baad unki pratikriya main nahin dikhti
 Two different incidents occurred during the last 48 hours
 ek to mukhyamantri ke grih zile nalanda main hi hui jahaan unki party ke vidhayak jitendra kumaar shanivaar ko biharsharif sadar aspataal pahunche
 Following the death of a party worker, he received further threats of abusive speech on not receiving his desired post-mortem report, in response to which the doctors there went on strike
 nishchit rup se jitendra kumaar dwaara jo kuch bhi kiya gaya wo rajd shashan kaal kii yaad dilaataa he
 But Nitish Kumar, being the MLA of his party, did not take any action on this misconduct
 shanivaar ko hi sitamarhi jail kaa ek video viral hua jahaan ek qaidi pintu tiwari jo do ejiniyaron kii hatya main sazaayafata he, usne jail main apana janmdin manaaya
 No one is allowed to celebrate his birthday in jail
 lekin iskaa mobile par recording hua or jab bhoj hua to usamen kai qaidi aaraam se phone par baat karte dikh rahe hai
 The head of the jail department is Nitish Kumar himself and there is no jammer in any jail in Bihar, so perhaps no more person could be blamed for this
 lekin is ghatana ke baad jail ke kuch karmchaariyon ko nilambit kar diya gaya he
 But the truth is that criminals also run parallel rule in jail under Nitish Raj and their health is not affected
 bihar kii sitamarhi jail main hatyare kaa manaa janmdin, VIDEO viral hone par 7 pulicekarmi suspendaisse bhi zyaada sharmnaak or chaunkaane vaali ghatana rajya ke gopalganj main ghati jahaan ghoose main 15 lakh nahin dene par ek thekedaar ramashankar singh ko zindaa jala diya gaya
 Although the police is investigating the case from both the murder and suicide angle, police has not been able to arrest the accused Water Resources Department Chief Engineer Muralidhar Singh or his wife till date
 ghoose na dene par adhikariyon dwaara kisi thekedaar ko zindaa jala dene kii shaayad bihar kii yah pehali ghatana he
 But it shows that without bribe, no officer works in Bihar even though Chief Minister Nitish Kumar continues to call for zero tolerance policy against corruption

 pichley saal disambar main police ne nagpur hawaondde se teen yuvakon ko giraftaar kiya tha jo iesas main shaamil hone ke liye desh chhodane kii firaaq main the
 Walid, also serving as the Syrian foreign minister, expressed his inability to help in the release of the 39 Indians who were held hostage by ISIS militants in Iraq's city of Mosul in June 2014
 walid ne kaha, 'agar ve iraqi bal kii hiraasat main hote to main unki rihaai sunishchit karne kaa prayaas karata, lekin agar ve ab bhi iesas ke bandhak hai to main kuch nahin kar saktaa

 When the woman came to know that she was pregnant, she underwent several medical tests, which showed that if she does not undergo an abortion, she can be killed
 2 june 2016 ko doctoron ne uskaa garbhpaat karne se inkaar kar diya kyonki use garbhadhaaran kiye 20 hafte se zyaada ho chuke the

 yah sukhad sanyog he ki hindi kii varisht lekhika chitra mudgal ko pichley hafte jab varsh 2018 kaa pratishthit sahitya academy puraskaar dene kii ghoshnaa hui tab unke jivan ke pachhattar varsh puure hone main sirf paanch din shesh the
 The announcement of the Sahitya Akademi Award on Vela for completing seventy-five years of social activism with authorial dignity gave him double happiness
 is khushi ke bare main puche jane par ve apni chir-parichit mridu aawaaj main kahati hai, "yah vanchit tabakon ke prati meri saamaajik patibaddhta or usase upje mere sahitya kaa sammaan he
 The matter is also true because his novel, published in 2016, Post Box no
 203 naala sopaara ko sahitya academy puraskaar mila he vah samaaj main ghor upeksha ke shikaar "third gender'' kii yatnaa, sangharsh or swapn ko abhivyakt karne vaala upanyaas he
 In recent years novels written on "third gender", it is distinguished from the fact that it has given importance to sensation rather than facts and analysis rather than information
 yahaan kinnaron kaa jivan-satya tathyon or aankadon ke rup main nahin balki katha ke bheetar hi kuch is tarah se piroyaa gaya he ki upanyaas behad maarmik ho uthaa he
 The novel is an excellent example of how excellent works can be written on the lives of neglected sections without being burdened with contemplation, facts and figures
 puraa upanyaas apni schuli shiksha ke dauraan hi kinnaron kii mandali ko saunp die gaye vinod urf binni urf bimali dwaara apni jivan sthitiyon or ghar kii smritiyon kaa varnan karte hue apni ba (maa) ko likhe gaye kramvaar patron ke rup main sanyojit he
 The mother also writes a letter to her eunuch son, but those counter letters remain in the background
 bete ke likhe patron se hi maaloom hota he ki maa ne apane patr main kya likhaa tha? patr-style chintan-pravaah yaa vichaar-pravaah ko abhivyakt karne ke liye sarvaadhik upyukt maani jaati he, lekin lekhika ne iske madhyam se katha-pravaah ko abhivyakt karke ek anoothaa prayog kiya he or isamen vah puri tarah safal bhi hui hai
 The presence of a lot of storytelling in the novel is a testimony to his creative skills
 saamaanya manushya kii tarah bhedbhaav rahit garimapurna jivan hi upanyaas ke mukhya paatr vinod kaa sapana he par lekhika is sapane ko puraa karne main raajnneeti kii bhoomika ko lekar sashankit hai
 Mainstream politics is not interested in providing human dignity to the eunuchs but only to use them as vote banks by luring reservation
 isliye ve is samasya ke saamaajik samaadhaan ko adhik tarjeeh detii hai
 The novel raises a big question, how will a sexist society tolerate linguists? Freedom from a sex-centered society is the dream of this novel and its central narrative
 chitra mudgal ke sarokaar kaa dayera aarambh se hi vyapak rahaa he
 She has fought relentlessly against all forms of social, economic or gender inequality and even today she remains vocal on these questions

 Premchand's story Thakur's well inspired him towards Rachna-karma
 ve kahati hai, "premchand kii is kahani ne mere man main jatigat bhed-bhav ke prati teevr vitrushna paidaa kii
 After reading the story, when i became aware of caste discrimination, i saw that such discrimination is done by the people of my household
 ''uttar pradesh ke unnav janapad ke prasiddh jameendaar khandaan ke thakur bajrang singh kii potee chitra ke liye yah jatigat shreshthata bodh se mukt hone kii shuruuaat thi
 She began to express what she could not say by writing
 chitra un rachanakaaron main nahin hai, jinke jivan or rachana-karm main baari antarvirodh dikhaai detaa he
 It is not his nature to be a facilitator in life and a rebel in creation
 ve jivan main sangharshon ke abhaav kii purti rachana se nahin karatin
 Advocacy towards women is evident both in her life and in literature
 agar ve maanati hai ki stri ko apane faisle swayan lene kaa haq hona chahie to ve ise apane jivan se pramanit bhi karti hai
 We can imagine how difficult it must have been for an interracial love marriage of a Thakur landlord family girl in the sixties
 ghar-parivaar main unka virodh lambey samay tak jari rahaa
 His writing personality has taken shape amid protests
 mumbai main ucch shiksha ke dauraan prasiddh majdoor netaa dutt samant ke sampark main ain or sangathit tathaa asangathit kshetra ke majdoor andolanon se unka gaharaa judaav rahaa
 There she struggled for the women who sweep in big houses
 ham kah sakate hai ki chitra mudgal ne stri vimarsh kaa jhanda nahin uthaaya he balki use jiya he
 That is why their female discourse is wider and more concerned than some fashionable female consultants
 ve stri vimarsh ko deh vimarshkaron se adhik vyapak or sarokaardharmee banaati hai or stri vimarsh ko deh vimarsh main avamoolyit kar dene kaa ghor virodh karti hai
 She insists on understanding and solving the women's question not from the perspective of the West but in Indian contexts
 shaayad isiilie unke man main maatrutiv or patnitv ko lekar koi hikaarat-bhav nahin he jaisaa ki kuch strivadiyon main dikhaai detaa he
 She says, "I want to end the rift between men and women, but i do not think it is fair from anywhere to end their gender and make the woman number two
" ''rachana-karm ko saamaajik hastkshep kaa paryaay maanane vaali chitra mudgal ne ab tak lagbhag teraa kahani sangrahon, chaar upanyaason or paanch bal katha-sangrahon ke madhyam se hindi sahitya ko samrudh kiya he
 He never bothered to be "politically correct" even though rachna-karma was synonymous with social intervention
 unki patibaddhta kisi lekhak sanghathan yaa party ke prati na hokar sahitya or apane samaaj ke prati rahi
 Through his life and literature till date, he has worked to free words like commitment and concern from the bondage of party and organizations
 ve is baat kaa pramaan hai ki rachanaakaar ko apane samaaj ke prati patibaddh or sarokaari hone ke liye kisi party yaa sanghathan kii sadsyta aavashyak nahin he
