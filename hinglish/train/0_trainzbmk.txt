 ' kya ab se chand ghanton main duniya khatm hone vaali he
 May 21 is being described as the Day of Judgment
 ek america dharm prachaarak ne daawa kiya he ki america samay ke mutabik 21 may kii shaam 6 baje qayaamat aane vaali he
 That is to say, if the apostle believes, there is only 8 hours of time for human civilization
 is daawey ke baad duniya bhar main qayaamat par ek badi bahes shuru ho gai he kyonki ye sawaal he duniya bhar ke 6 arab logon kii jindagi kaa
 a rumor emanating from America has scared the minds of millions of people to end the world
 afvaah ye he ki agle chand ghanton main duniya ke khatmen kii shuruyaat hone vaali he
 Today's date has been named Judgment Day ie Day of Judgment
 wo din jab jisas christ dharti par utrenge or duniya ke sarvanaash kii shuruyaat karenge
 Surprisingly, this rumor has originated with America, the most developed country in the world, and those who trust it are also in the same country
 ek america dharm prachaarak harold camping ne bhavishyavaanee kii he ki america samay ke mutabik 21 may kii shaam 6 baje duniya ke khatmen kii shuruyaat hogi or agal paanch maheene tak puri duniya kabhi jaljla to kabhi bukamp jaisi aapadaaen jhelti rahangi
 These five months will be the most difficult moments of human life
 in paanch maheenon main puri insaani sabhyataa khatm ho jaaegi
 Family Radio Camping announced its prediction by posting posters and hoardings around the world in the name of Judgment Day
 afvaah failaane ke liye internet kaa bhi khub sahaara liya gaya
 In order to instill fear in the people, signs of the beginning of the Khatma have also been reported on the Internet
 had to ye he ki duniya bhar main aane vaali prakritik aapadaaon ko bhi, duniya ke khatmen ke lakshanon se jod diya gaya he
 Camping has cited research on the Bible to convince people of its prophecy
 camping kaa daawa he ki 70 saal tak bible par research karne ke baad unhen duniya ke khatmen kii taarikh samaj main ai
 The number of people who believe in camping claims is also in lakhs
 pichley chand dinon se ye log sadakon par utar aae hai
 Those who are wearing Judgment Day posters and t-shirts are airing this rumor
 unke jehan main ye khyal ghar kar chukaa he ki wo aisa prachaar kar logon ke aane vaali aapadaa se jaagruk kar rahe hai
 The result of these efforts is that May 21 has become a date of panic in many countries of the world
 camping kii maane to agle chand ghanton main jisas christ dubaara dharti par aaenge or tabhi tabaahi kii shuruyaat hogi
 Two percent of the world's good people will send Jesus to heaven immediately
 ye wo log honge jinhone kabhi koi bura kaam nahin kiya
 The rest of the population will continue to face the fear of death every day on earth for the next 153 days
 camping kii theory ke mutabik 21 may se shuru hui vinaash lila 21 oktober tak dharti par se insaan kaa namonishaan mitaa degi
 Camping also knows that his claims are big, he has coined many new theories to prove his claims to be true but scientists, geologists and other religious gurus are not willing to believe these theories
 camping kii is theory ko mahaj logon ko daraane bhar kaa ek or jariya mana ja rahaa he
 Congress's media in-charge Randeep Singh Surjewala on Sunday launched a scathing attack on the Mododi government
 petroloradijalki keemton par surajevaala ne kaha ki modi sarkaar kii dogali niti saamne aa gai he
 On the one hand there is talk of reducing the price of oils, on the other hand the prices are increased
 surejwaala ne ek twit kar petrol-dijal ke daam main badhotaree ko 'dakaiti', 'katautee' or 'badhotaree' se joda
 Significantly, after the reduction of petrol and diesel prices two days ago, the prices of oils have started increasing again
 beete 5 oktober ko centre sarkaar ne dhai rupye katautee kaa elaan kiya or rajyon se bhi itani katautee karne kii baat kahi
 Many states have also cut the rupees two and a half rupees due to which the price of oil has come down by a total of Rs
 5, but the price has started increasing from the next day
 dilli main shanivaar ko petrol ke daam main 18 paise or ravivaar ko 14 paise kii badhotaree hui
 Joe Petrol 81 on Friday
 50 rupye prati litre bik rahaa tha, ravivaar ko uski keemat 81
 82 rupees
 isi tarah dijal ke daam main shanivaar or ravivaar ko 29 paise kii badhotaree hui
 Diesel 72 with a cut of two and a half rupees on Friday
 95 rupye par bik rahaa tha
 Its price 73 on the same Sunday
 53 rupye prati litre ho gai
 Modi government's double policy - given with one hand, taken with the other hand! In the last two days (in Delhi) - Petrol price - ₹ 0
 32 / ltr badhen ⬆️deazal ke daam-₹0
 co / setfohm6be — Randeep Singh Surjewala (@rssurjewala) October 7, 2018 Surjewala on Sunday targeted the Modi government by tweeting this same increase
 surajevaala ke mutabik, modi sarkaar ek taraf keemten ghataane kii baat karti he, jabaki duusari ore har din telon ke daam main ijapha dekha ja rahaa he
 He said that the public will remember this 'trick' of the Center
 petrol dijal ke daam main centre kii 2
 The deduction of 50 rupees was also called a sham by the Aam Aadmi Party
 aam aadmi party ke pravaktaa dilip pandey ne shanivaar ko kaha ki centre sarkaar kii katautee mahaj dikhaava he
 He said, the truth is that Delhi still has cheaper petrol and diesel from all BJP ruled states and non BJP ruled states of the country
 dilip pandey ne kaha ki 13-14 rupye petrol badhaakar dhai rupaya kam karke aap kya sabit karnaa chaahate hai? petrol kii keemten bargad ke ped kii tarah vishaal hoti ja rahi hai
 He said that you are breaking the leaves and saying that we have eliminated the problem
 kya aapako bhi blakehad kii problem he? blakehad kii problem bahut hi kaaman he
 But this problem increases due to not paying attention
 haalanki bazaar main bahut se aise upaay maujuud hai jinke istemaal se blakehad kii problem se chhutkaaraa paaya ja saktaa he lekin aap chahen to kuch khasagharelu upaay apanaakar bhi is samasya ko dur kar sakate hai
 Cinnamon and honey are two things that you can use to overcome the problem of blackhead
 shahad or dalacheenee donon main hi anti-bacterial gun paae jate hai
 Which reduces the risk of infection
 iske alaava shahad skin ko moishcharise karne kaa kaam karata he
 Most people remove the blackhead by pressing with fingers and nails, but you can make a strip with the help of honey and cinnamon
 isse blakehad to dur ho hi jayega saath hi naak bhi chikaniho jaaegi
 How to use? Mix cinnamon and honey well
 chehre ke jis hisse par blakehad ho rakhe hai, vahaan is paste ko lagaakar kuch der ke liye chhod den
 Apply a strip of cotton on top of this paste
 jab ye paste sookhne lage to ise halke haathon se utaar len
 After that wash the face thoroughly
 do se teen baar ke istemaal se hi blakehad dur ho jaaenge

 The film is being produced by Yash Raj Films
 isamen arjuna or pariniti chopra lead role main hai
 Let me tell you that both started their Bollywood career together with 'ishqzaade'
 'big bos' ke ghar main 80waan din swami om ke drame se shuru hua, unhone ek paper par 'bibi vuvars, mujhe maaf karo or plis mujhe vot karo' or us paper ko apane kapade par lagaakar ghar main ghoomte rahe
 After this, 'bigg Boss' announced the resumption of the freight train task
 task shuru karne kaa bajer bajane se pehle hi swami om khaanaa lekar malgadee main baith gaye
 As soon as he sat down, he snatched the sheet of Nitibha, when he asked for the sheet back, he said that he was not 'bigg Boss' so he would not return
 kuch der baad hi swami om ne nitibha kii chhatari chin lee or dene se inkaar karne lage
 Angered by this, Manu helped Nitibha snatch the umbrella back
 is chhina-jhapati main swami om ko chot lag gai or khun bahane laga
 He started spraying his blood in the goods train itself
 'big bos' ne unhen kanpation room main bulaayaa jahaan vah rote hue shikaayat karne lage ki manu or nitibha ne unke saath gundgardee kii he or unhen ghar se nikaala janaa chahie
 But 'bigg Boss' reprimanded him that he violated the rules of the task and climbed into the goods train even after being out of the task
 tippaniyan Eventually the task resumes and Rohan and Mona in turn release Manveer, Manu and Nitibha from prison and hand them over to the 'big Boss'
 iske baad task khatm hone kii ghoshnaa kii or mona se kaha ki vah gharavaalon ko bataaen ki unhone or rohan ne kis gharavaale kii kitni keemat lagaai thi
 He then announced that through this task, the families had increased the prize money by Rs 43, 99, 206
 unhone yah bhi ghoshnaa kii ki bani or swami om captaini ke daavedaar hai
 After this Manu, Manveer, Lopa and other householders started making fun of Swami Om saying that they cost only Rs 444
 baad main lopa rohan se yah kahati dikhin ki prise mani badhaane main bani kaa koi yogadan nahin rahaa he isliye unhen captain banaakar vah unhen ek saptaah kii immunity nahin dengi
 Rohan said that he cannot see Swami Om as the captain of the house
 isliye vah bani ko hi saport karenge
 Shortly after this, 'bigg Boss' gave another task to the family members
 unhen tay samay main ghar ke alag-alag hisson main selfi leni thi, is task ke liye swami om ko diarector or manavir ko assistant diarector banaaya gaya
 As soon as the task started, Swami Om declared that he would be a part of every selfie
 unhen rokane kii koshish main manu-manavir kii unase ladaai bhi ho gai
 Late in the night, Swami Om expressed his desire to be the captain of the house in front of Nitibha, Manveer and Manu and also sought votes for him
 haalanki manavir ne kaha ki vah captain banane ke laayak nahin hai
 Even before the buzzer of starting the task, Swami Om took food and sat in the goods train
 baithte hi unhone nitibha kii chadar chin lee, jab unhone chadar waapas maangi to kehane lage ki vah unki nahin 'big bos' kii he isliye vah waapas nahin karenge
 After some time, Swami Om snatched the umbrella of Nitibha and refused to give it
 isse gusse main aae manu ne chaataa waapas chhinane main nitibha kii madad kii
 In this snarl, Swami Om got hurt and started bleeding
 vah malgadee main hi apana khun chhidakane lage
 'bigg Boss' summons him to the confession room where he starts crying crying that Manu and Nitibha have committed hooliganism with him and he should be evicted from the house
 lekin 'big bos' ne unhen fatkaar lagaai ki unhone task ke niyamon kaa ulanghan kiya or task se baahar hone ke baad bhi malgadee main chadh gaye
 The comments antat: task dobaaraa shuru hua or rohan or mona ne manavir, manu or nitibha ko baari-baari se jail se reeha kar 'big bos' ko saunp diya
 After this, the task was announced and asked Mona to tell the householders how much he and Rohan had charged
 iske baad unhone ghoshnaa kii ki is task ke jariye gharavaalon ne prise mani 43, 99, 206 rupee badha lee he
 He also announced that Bani and Swami Om are contenders for captaincy
 iske baad manu, manavir, lopa or anya gharavaale swami om kaa majaak udaane lage ki unki keemat keval 444 rupee he
 Later, Lopa was seen telling Rohan that Bani had no contribution in raising the prize money, so she would not give him a week's immunity by making him captain
 vahiin rohan ne kaha ki vah swami om ko ghar ke captain ke rup main nahin dekh sakate
 Therefore, he will support Bani only
 iske kuch der baad hi 'big bos' ne ek or task gharavaalon ko diya
 He had to take a selfie in different parts of the house in due time, for this task, Swami Om was made director and Manveer was made assistant director
 task shuru hote hi swami om ne dikalair kar diya ki vah har selfi kaa hissaa rahenge
 manu-manveer also fought with them in an attempt to stop them
 der raat swami om ne nitibha, manavir or manu ke saamne ghar kaa captain banane kii ichha jaahir kii or unase apane liye vot bhi maanga
 However, Manveer said that he does not deserve to be the captain

 If everything remains normal then India's estimated GDP 4 by 2025
 80 trillian kii hogi
 If Gender Discrimination is Abolished, India's Economy 7

 In 10 years, women can contribute $ 290 trillion to India's GDP, which will be 60 percent more than the projected GDP
 sabhi kshetron main bharat kii jidipi main mahilaon kii bhaagedari sabase kam he
 The contribution of women to GDP in India is 17 per cent, China 41 per cent, Sub Saharan Africa 39 per cent, Latin America 33 per cent, while the global average is around 37 per cent
 curent femail workforce bhaagedari 31 fisadi he jabaki 2025 tak arthvyavastha main 700 billian dollar jodne ke liye yah bhaagedari 41 fisadi tak badhaani hogi
 This would mean increasing the number of working women to 68 million

 Women have 503 billion dollars for the country

 bhale hi yah 1-2 timahi main naa ho lekin agle 3-4 saal main jarur ho saktaa he

 If women also start working in the number of men then it will add 27 percent share in the country's GDP
 isse jidipi pahunch jaaegi 2
 4 billion dollars, which is the uk's current GDP of 2
 52 lakh karod ke kareeb hogi
 In the US and UK, the loss of GDP due to non-employment of women is only 5 per cent, while in India it is 27 per cent
 bharat main jo mahilaayein kaam karti hai, wo sheersh tak nahin pahunch paati hai
 Only 5 percent of the board seats are held by women, which is the lowest among BRICS (brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) countries
 jabaki yah sabit ho chukaa he ki mahilaon se pradarshan main sudhaar aata he
 If there are more women in the board and the company, then it will be beneficial - the return on capital on investment will be 66 percent, the return on equity will be 53 percent and the return on sales will be 42 percent
 uttar pradesh kii rajdhani or purv pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi ke garh main chunavi jang rochak hoti ja rahi he

 Eventually, the party announced the name of Bollywood star Javed Jaffrey

 They told that both were produced before an executive magistrate and were asked to fill a bond of good behavior
 unhone bataaya ki unhen bond bharne par reeha kar diya gaya
 However, the police said that they were mere remarks at first sight with no intention of treason

 When there was talk about a ban on the porn site in the Supreme Court in Delhi, the government said that it is not possible for her to enter someone's bedroom

 But the police in Mumbai might not believe that if a man and woman are in a room of their own free will then it cannot be entered there
 mumbai se sate madh main dheron hotel hai jahaan premi-premika jate hai
 It is obvious that both the adults will go on their own free will to go for a holiday on the beach
 lekin beete dinon police ko ye samasya lagane lagi
 He arrested 13 couples
 ladakiyon ke parivaar waalon ko bula liya
 The boys were treated as if crime had taken place
 sabko hotel ke kamare check kar karke nikaala gaya
 The police arrived just as they went to search for a criminal
 police kahati he ki use shikaayat mili thi ki deh vyapaar ho rahaa he
 But she still could not tell the media who complained, how did she trust the complaint at first glance? And even if we believe that there was power in the complaint, then why did the police dare to remove the couples from the rooms? mumbai police ke nirdeshon ke mutabik saare hotel waalon ko tamaam guest kii pahchaan rakhana jaruri he jo unhone kamare dene ke pehle puri kii thi to phir usne register check kyon nahin kiye? aisa kaise ho saktaa he ki police ko dheron hotalon par ek saath shaq hone laga? ek or baat, madh main dashakon se log yun hi chuttee manaane ke liye ja rahe hai, ab achaanak se aisa kya hone laga ki use shikaayatein milane lageen?tippaniyan One side of the police is that there are many illegal hotels in the area of madh where young people stay, then the big question is that if the police has any such information then why is it not complaining directly to BMC or other agencies? How many such complaints have he made before this? How will the person staying in the hotel know that it is illegal? soshal media par mache ho hangaame ke bich police ne apane andaaj vaali jaanch baitha di he
 Where the top officers will check whether the uniformers below have crossed the law? But for all this he will need witness and evidence
 koi peedit chaiye hoga, jo aakar kahe ki police ne kya vyavhaar kiya, jaahir si baat he jo badi mushkil se police ke changul se bhaaga ho wo kya dobaaraa aayega? There are many hotels in Madh adjoining Mumbai which are visited by lover and girlfriend
 jaahir si baat he samandar kinare chuttee manaane pahunchane ke liye donon vayask apni marji se jate honge
 But these days the police started to feel this problem
 usne 13 jodon ko dhar dabocha
 Called the family members of the girls
 ladakon ke saath aisa vyavhaar hua maano aparaadh hua he
 Everyone was checked out of the hotel room and removed
 police bilkul vaise pahunchi jaise kisi apradhi kii talash ke liye jaati he

 The director of the film 'barfi' said in a session organized on the subject of 'female Protagonist in Bollywood Today - How Real Is the Discourse' at the ongoing NFDC film market here that the way a director shows women in his films is often about women
 His thinking is revealed
 tippaniyan Basu said, “the personality of actors and directors is a reflection of their work
 anand (el raay) 'tanu vaids manu' bana sakate hai, vikaas (bahal) 'queen' bana sakate hai
 But a director like Rohit Shetty cannot make 'queen'
 aap jis tarah ke insaan hai or jis tarah mahilaon ko dekhte hai, yah us par nirbhar karata he
 For example, the dialogue that Salman speaks, Shahrukh can never speak
 ' unhone kaha ki kuch mahila kendrit filmon ko dekhakar yah nahin sochna chahie ki bollywood main puri tarah ek badlaav aa gaya he
 Basu said, 'you should not judge a change from just two or three films

 Anand (L
 Rai) can make ‘tanu Weds Manu’, Vikas (bahl) can make ‘queen’

 It depends on the kind of person you are and the way you look at women

 He said that looking at some women-centric films, one should not think that Bollywood has undergone a complete change

 ' Senior BJP leader Jaswant Singh, while correcting the decision to change helicopter purchase norms in 2003 during the NDA regime, claimed that it was done purely for business reasons to make the deal competitive
 
 endie sarkaar main rakshaamantri rah chuke jaswant singh ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha, yah sahi he ki us samay takneekee maandand main badlaav kiya gaya tha, lekin ise lekar ho rahe ho-halle kii koi vajah nahin he, kyonki aisa achche kaarnon ke liye kiya gaya tha
 The comments unhone kaha ki varsh 2000 main mul prastaav aayaa or vaayu sena ne kaha ki ati vishisht vyaktiyon kii awajahi ke liye kharide jane vaale in helicopteron kii 18000 foot oonche tak ud sakane kii kshamta honi chahie
 But when the proposal came to the Cabinet Committee on Security Affairs, the then National Security Advisor Brajesh Mishra rightly suggested that the single vendor proposal would not be appropriate
 us samay keval ek hi company 18000 foot tak kii oonchai tak udne vaale helicopter banaati thi
 Singh said that Brajesh Mishra had done nothing wrong by doing so
 purv vaayu sena pramukh espi tyaagi par lagaae ja rahe aaropon par jaswant singh ne kaha, hamen purv vaayu sena pramukh par anargal aarope nahin lagane chahie
 It is not in the interest of both the Air Force and the country
 jaanch chal rahi he
 Tyagi himself is saying that the investigation should be done as soon as possible
 aap unke suzav ko kyon nahin maan rahe hai
 He said, i am sad that the fact is being forgotten that the company responsible for this case is the Italian company
 hamen sachai ko jaananaa chahie or uske baad ek-duusare par aarope lagane chahie
 Jaswant Singh, who was the defense minister in the NDA government, told reporters, it is true that the technical criteria was changed at that time, but there is no reason for the hustle and bustle about it, because it was done for good reasons
 
 tippaniyan He said that the original proposal came in the year 2000 and the Air Force said that these helicopters purchased for movement of vips should have the capability to fly up to 18000 feet high
 lekin jab yah prastaav suraksha maamalon kii cabinet samiti main aayaa, to tatkaaleen rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar brajesh mishra ne sahi suzav diya ki ekal vikreta prastaav uchit nahin rahegaa
 At that time only one company made helicopters flying up to a height of 18000 feet
 singh ne kaha ki brajesh mishra ne aisa karke kuch galat nahin kiya tha
 On the allegations being made on former Air Force Chief SP Tyagi, Jaswant Singh said, "we should not make unwarranted allegations against the former Air Force Chief
 yah vayusena or desh donon ke hit main nahin he
 The investigation is underway
 tyaagi khud kah rahe hai ki jaanch jald se jald honi chahie
 Why are you not accepting his suggestion
 unhone kaha, mujhe dukh is baat kaa he ki is tathy ko bhulaayaa ja rahaa he ki is maamle main doshi italy kii company he

 He said that the crisis of government debt in the euro area has been very deep
 iske saath hi america ko bhi aarthik sankat sata rahaa he isse puri duniya kaaphi dabaav main he
 Both are huge risks in their own right
 yadi donon hi sankat saath-saath badhate hai to vyapaar, vitt or vishwaas ke maamle main vyapak prabhaav padegaa
 The Reserve Bank Governor is in the US to attend World Bank and IMF meetings
 us main wo eenton vaale bistar par teen or logon ke saath soya karte the
 At that time they used to have porridge, buns and some vegetables to eat
 unke ek kisaan saathi lu housheng ne bataaya tha ki bhukh lagane par ye koi nahin dekhtaa tha ki khaane main mil kya rahaa he
 At night Xi Jinping used to study in the light of Dhibri in his cave
 unhen padhane kaa shauk tha
 In the current budget session of Rajasthan, the bill was passed in which minimum educational qualification has been fixed for contesting elections for candidates of Panchayati Raj Institutions
 iske saath hi nijee kshetra ko lekar teen ahm kadamon kaa elaan kiya gaya
 The most important announcement was made by Education Minister Kalicharan Saraf to set up a regulatory body to oversee private universities
 sarkaar iske liye ek vidheyak laane kii taiyaari kar rahi he
 In fact, recently the chancellor of Jodhpur National University Kamal Mehta was arrested because thousands of degrees of the university were sold in exchange for money to students who never came to class
 sarraf ke mutabik, darjan bhar nijee vishvavidhyalayon ko lekar aisi hi shikaayatein mili hai
 The government now wants to set up a panel to monitor these universities and investigate fake degrees
 duusari ore sansthaanon ko shaq he ki aisa unke upar niyantran ke liye kiya ja rahaa he
 The owner of one such institute feared that under the proposed rule, the government will take a percentage of their earnings from private universities and if it is to be removed, it will have to pay a huge bribe
 nijee koching sansthaanon kii dhokhadhadi se chaatro ko bachaane ke liye bhi sarkaar niyam banane ja rahi he
 But is the government really serious about curbing the corrupt universities or is it just trying to make money by bending their arm? Already, allegations of corruption have been leveled against the state government that it had allocated the mines arbitrarily before the central government issued an ordinance regarding the auction of mines
 nijee clinicon or aspataalon kii nigaraanee ke liye sarkaar clinical establishment act banane kii taiyaari main he
 Some large private hospitals have wrongly bought cheap land or have acquired government hospitals at the cost of loopholes
 ve ab baari munafa kama rahe hai
 Now complaints are coming that these hospitals also charge huge fees for the basic services on which very little is spent
 sarkaar kii ore se kanoon banane ke prayaason kaa nijee doctoron ne virodh shuru kar diya he
 They are opposed to giving representation to the police in the regulatory body and also to keep doctors who do not have indoor facilities under the purview of this law
 is maamle main bhi sawaal uth rahe hai ki sarkaar aisa kar ke aakhir marijon kii kitni madad kar paaegi kyonki chikitsa kshetra main sarkaar ke apane prayaas bhi badahaal hai
 The government's plan to start second medical college at Jaipur University affiliated to Rajasthan University of Health Sciences at the earliest has failed due to widespread confusion
 chaahe pravesh pariksha kaa maamla ho yaa shaikshanik str main sudhaar or niyuktiyon kaa, yah vishvavidhyalay apni aakshamata ke liye pehle se hi badnaam rahaa he
 The BJP government's policy of retaining the appointed officials of the previous Congress government in universities or commissions is now proving to be dangerous
 isse aisa lagata he ki sarkaar ke paas ichhashakti kii kami he
 This is the reason that the new rules and laws only seem to be ritualistic exercises
 khud bijepi vidhayakon ne bajet satr main rajya main buniyadi jaruraton ko na puraa kiye jane ko lekar sarkaar kii naakaamiyaan ginaayin
 Minister of State Anita Baghel has also expressed anger that the Mafia alliance of officer-contractor-broker developed under the Congress Raj has been strengthened

 bombai ucch nyaayalay ne adarsh houseing ghotaale main praathmiki darj karne main ‘deree’ ko lekar mangalvaar ko kendriya jaanch beuro kii kadi khinchaai kii or use do saptaah ke bheetar is sambandh main apana faisla karne ko kaha
 On the other hand, the Maharashtra government has opposed the central agency to get the matter investigated
 adaalat ne iske saath hi do saptaah baad agali sunwaayee par sibiai ke sanyukt nideshak ko uske samaksh pesh hone ke liye saman jari kiye jane kaa bhi nirdesh diya
 Hearing a petition in the Adarsh case, a bench of judges BH Marlapalle and UD Salvi said, "it has been more than two months since the CBI initiated preliminary inquiry into the case
" aapane (sibiai) ab tak exiaar kyon nahin darj kii
 'judge Marlapalle said,' We have failed to understand why there is a delay in filing the FIR
 media reporton main ek tarah se sibiai kii praathmiki kaa masauda tak aa chukaa he or usamen sabhi aropiyon ke naamon kaa khulaasa kiya gaya he
 "on the other hand, the state home ministry has said in the affidavit filed in the court that the issues raised in the model case fall under the jurisdiction of the state government and the central government has" nothing to do "
 halafname main kaha gaya he, ‘is prakaar kii jaanch ko kisi anya agency yaa sibiai ko saunpna ek ativaadee upaay he or behad durlabh sthiti main aisa kiya jaataa he
 It also states that there is no justifiable basis in handing over the investigation to the CBI

 'according to the petition, three former Chief Ministers are allegedly involved in the scam, and as such the ACB may be pressured not to conduct an investigation effectively and hence the entire investigation should be handed over to the CBI
 atirikt solisitor general darius khambata ne sibiai kaa paksh rakhte hue jaanch puri karne ke liye chaar saptaah kaa samay maanga or kaha, ‘yah ek samvedansheel masalaa he jisamen bade naam shaamil hai
 The agency does not want to make a hasty decision
 ’adaalat ne haalanki agency ko do saptaah se adhik kaa samay dene se inkaar kar diya or sibiai ke kshetreey nideshak ko adaalat main pesh hone kaa aadesh diya
 The affidavit filed by the Ministry of Home Affairs states, 'in the Adarsh case, the issues that have come up fall under the jurisdiction of the State Government

 a post shared by Taryn Manning tm (@tarynmanning) on jan 21, 2018 at 7:44 pm PST rajasthan ke ajmer main swatantraaa diwas ke maukey par jo kuch bhi hua, use dekhakar lagata he ki desh bhale hi aaazaad ho gaya ho lekin samaaj apni dakiyanoosee soch se aaj tak aaazaad nahin hua
 The state's female Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje was hoisting the flag on the occasion of Independence Day in Ajmer, at the same time
 me
 Whatever happened in Ajmer at a distance of, it was embarrassing of the society
 log to us mahila ko sharmasaar kar kisi ko munh dikhaane laayak nahin chodana chaahate the
 But this slap is on the face of civilized society
 ghatana ko dekh kar kanoon kaa rakhwala sharamshaar hone ke bajaay tamaashabeen bana hua tha
 The justice of the crowd gathered in the Ambedkar Kutcha township of Ajmer reminds me of any Taliban picture from Afghanistan
 kanoon ke rakhwalon yani pulisavaalon ke saamne hi ek mahila coped se baandhakaruske bal kaate ja rahe hai
 This woman is accused by the settlers that she is spoiling the youth of the township
 unke saath galat kaam karti he, jiskaa sidhaa asar yahaan rahane waalon ke bacchon par padataa he
 Just on this charge, the woman was dragged from her house and brought to the intersection
 is kaam main purushon ke saath mahilaayein bhi shaamil thim
 Instead of saving the woman, the constables kept watching the spectacle, this woman was first bald by cutting her hair in front of the entire colony and later it was tied on the tree
 phir isaki pitayee kii gai
 People also called the police
 samay rahete police bhi aa gai
 a police constable also reached the spot, but he preferred to enjoy the justice of the crowd on the spot rather than having the woman rescued or taken to the police station safely
 is sipaahi ke saamne hi logon ne is mahila kii durgati kii
 This woman's husband does not live with her and has two young children
 ye mazdooree karti he
 No one had ever complained in the township
 sabase badi baat he ki basti un purushon yaa ladakon ko is tarah kii sajaa kyon nahi detii jin par inhen galat kaam karne kaa shaq tha
 The police showed a loose attitude
 People informed the top police officers about this incident, then Christian Ganj station in-charge also reached the spot
 thanadhikari vijendra gil pehle to baat karne ke liye hi taiyaar nahin hue, lekin baad main jab baat kii to unka kahana tha ki pehle do mahilaon ke ladane kii soochna mili thi or ham maukey par pahunche
 We did not know that all this is happening here
 ye kaam jisane bhi kiya he, un sab ke khilaaf mukadmaa darj kar giraftaar kii ja rahi he
 This is the third case of mob justice in a month, this is the third case of such justice of mob in a month
 iske pehle udaipur ko kotda main badchalni ke aarope main mahila ko nanga kar kai dinon tak ped se baandh diya tha to alvar main ek mahila ke saath samuhik balaatkaar kar uske sharir par gandi-gandi gaaliyaan likh di thim
 In both these cases also, the police first avoided postponement of mutual quarrel, but later action was taken to catch the case
 jail main band pakistan ke purv piem navaj sharif kii sehat behad najuk haalat main he
 Nawaz Sharif's blood platelet count has fallen significantly and he has been admitted to the hospital in an emergency condition

 bhartiya sena ne buudhvaar ko jammu ke poonch jile main bhimbar gali sector main niyantran rekha (elosi) par pakistani sena ke hamale kaa munhtod jawaab diya
 Two Pakistani army soldiers have been killed in retaliation by the army
 sena ke ek adhikari ne guuruuvaar ko kaha, kii buudhvaar ko bhimbar gali sector main bhartiya javaanon ke dwaara kii gai javaabi karrwai main pakistani sena ke do jawan maare gaye hai
 The Pakistani army fired indiscriminately at three locations on the loc, to which the Indian Army also responded impassively
 pakistani sena ne buudhvaar ko poonch jile ke bhimbar gali sector or rajouri jile main sangharsh viraam kaa ulanghan kiya tha
 Pakistan has violated the ceasefire in the Jammu region ten times in the last four days
 bhartiya sena ke anusaar, pakistani sena bharat main aatankwaadiyon kii ghuspaith ko aasaan banane ke liye dwipaksheeya sangharsh viraam kaa ulanghan kar rahi he a few days ago, the locals of the Nandan village of Buxar, in the convoy of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, carried out a deadly attack
 usee nandan gaanv main jadyu ke baagi netaa sharad yadav buudhvaar ko pahunche or mahapanchayat lagaai
 Sharad Yadav also met local Mahadalit families during the Mahapanchayat and accused Chief Minister Nitish Kumar of being anti-dalit
 sharad yadav ne nitish par aarope lagaate hue kaha ki nandan gaanv main jo bhi vikaas ke kaary hue hai usamen bhedbhaav kiya gaya he
 Dalits and Mahadalits have been ignored
 sharad yadav ne kaha ki sarkaar ke bhedbhaav purna ravaiya kii vajah se nitish kumaar par jaanaleva hamalaa kiya gaya tha
 Since then, local Dalit and Mahadalit families have been facing the wrath of the police
 sharad yadav ne yahaan maang rakhi kinitish kumaarake kafile par hamale ke aarope main jitne bhi sthaneey logon ke khilaaf praathmiki darj kii gai he wo saare maamle sarkaar waapas le
 Development works should be done in Nandan village in a just manner
 nandan gaanv main yojit sharad yadav ke mahapanchayat par jadyu ne kadaa hamalaa kiya he
 JDU said, Sharad Yadav's arrival in the village where the Chief Minister is attacked seems as if he has reached to praise the attackers
 party pravaktaa sanjay singh ne kaha ki mukhyamantri ke kafile ke upar hamalaa loktantr ke liye kaala adhyay he
 Sanjay Singh said that now Sharad Yadav has no work left and that is why Vahanandan is reaching the village and setting up a mahapanchayat
 gauratlab he ki nandan gaanv main sthaneey mahadalit pariwaron ne sharad yadav se mulaakaat bhi kii or unase apana dukh dard bayaan kiya
 The tradition of celebrating Ambedkar Jayanti in Uttar Pradesh has been in the BSP till now
 magar is saal pehali baar bispi ke alaava bijepi or congress sareekhee partiyon main bhiambedkar jayanti manaane ko lekar jabardast garmjoshidikhai di
 The Samajwadi Party government announced a holiday on Ambedkar's death anniversary on 6 December
 vahiin, congress neambedkarki 125veen jayanti ko puure salbhar manaane kii ghoshnaa kar di
 After all, how would the BJP be behind in such a situation, then the local leaders of BJP in Uttar Pradesh today ate khichdi with Dalits and invited them to join the party under the 'social Harmony Campaign'
 haalanki, pradesh str ke netaa in kaaryakramon main shaamil nahin hue, magar upi main sabhi jila ikaayiyon kii ore se daliton ke ghar ja kar unke saath meljol badhaane, party kii nitiyaan bataane or saath khaanaa khaane kaa kaarykram rakhaa gaya
 In one such event in Lucknow, MP Kaushal Kishore and BJP District President Ram Niwas Yadav from the Mohanlalganj Lok Sabha reserved seat of the capital along with BJP workers ate khichdi with Dalits in Bhainsora village of Chinhat
 haalanki, bijepi ke ambekar prem or daliton ko lekar baba ambedkar kii nitiyon ke zikr ke saath saath bijepi netaaon ne basapa supremeo mayawati or unki party bispi ko ji bhar kar kosa
 BJP MP Kaushal Kishore accused Mayawati of misleading the Dalits and at the same time blamed the poor condition of Dalits in UP
 jaahir he, bijepi kii nazren 2017 main aane vaale vidhaan sabha chunaavon par hai or party loksabhaa main bispi ke khilaaf mili badhat kaa phayda in chunaavon main uthaa kar bispi ko puri tarah khatm kar dena chaahati he
 If we look at the ground reality, the proximity between the Dalits and the BJP seems to be increasing
 dalit samaaj se jude log bhi is baat se inkaar nahin karte ki pichley loksabhaa chunaavon main daliton kii raajnneeti ko lekar alag soch dikhaai di he
 Dalits are now taking more pride in being part of the mainstream by considering themselves as Hindus rather than considering themselves as an exploited part of society
 duusari ore, bispi kaa votbank 2012 vidhansabha chunaavon ke baad lagaataar khisakta dikhaai diya he
 The party, which won a majority of 207 seats in the 403-seat UP Assembly in 2007, was reduced to 80 seats in the 2012 elections
 jabaki, 2014 loksabhaa chunaavon main ek bhi seat na jeet paane ke baad bispi kaa rashtriya party kaa darja bhi khatre main pad chukaa he
 In such a situation, bjp's attempt to woo the Dalit vote bank under the 'social harmony campaign' can now prove to be a danger bell for the BSP
 bijepi saansad kaushal kishor ne kaha, 'bijepi bharat main samtamulak samaaj kii sthapana chaahati he
 This was the dream of Baba Bhimrao Ambedkar too
 iske liye party ne kai baar mayawati ko mauka diya, yahaan tak kii apni party ko kamjor kar baba kaa mishan puraa karne kii koshish kii par unhone daliton ke utthan ke liye kuch nahin kiya
 With this program, the party wants to strengthen its Dalit vote bank and also tell the Dalits that the people you have followed so far have done nothing for you but if you join the BJP then 'sabka Saath Aur Under the 'development of all', along with others, you will also grow and uplift

 israeli pradhanmantri benjamin netanyahu ne bharat yatra ke duusare din somvaar ko apane samakaksh piem narendra modi ke saath nai dilli ke hyderabad house main kai muddon par jamkar baatcheet kii
 In the presence of both top leaders, 9 agreements including defense, security and elimination of terrorism were signed between the two countries
 bharat ke liye seemaa paar aatank badi samasya rahi he
 Especially for the peace along the border with Jammu and Kashmir, India has to struggle a lot, there is a continuous infiltration of terrorists from Pakistan along the Indian border
 isko lekar kaaphi paisa bhi kharch hota he
 The agreement between RAW and Mossad is challenging for India's external intelligence agency Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) to curb terrorist activities taking place against India
 pakistan main inter-services intellegency (ISI) in aatanki sanghathanon kaa paalan-poshan karti he or ek tarah se vahi in gatividhiyon kaa sanchaalan bhi karti he
 On the other hand, Israel's renowned intelligence agency Mossad (means-institution) specializes in destroying terrorist activities against itself from its base
 ab ro or mosaad ke bich suraksha or aatankwaad kaa saamana karne ke liye jo qaraar hua he, usase bharat ko 26 / 11 or uri jaise aatanki hamale taalane ko lekar khufia jaankaree kaa aadan-pradaan ho sakegaa
 The disclosure that was made by Morarji's mistake RAW was formed in 1968, when the country faced 2 major wars due to lack of external intelligence
 khufia agency is bare main koi bhi jaankaree ekatra nahin kar sakin ki china bharat ke khilaaf yuddh kii taiyaari kar rahaa he
 As a result, there was an india-china war in 1962 in which India had to pay a huge price along with defeat
 iske baad 1965 main pakistan ke saath yuddh bhi hamaari khufia jaankaree kii naakaami kaa hi parinaam tha
 The then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi formed RAW outside the IB in 1968 and Rameshwar Nath Kava became its head
 1977 tak yah ek sikret wing tha, lekin tatkaaleen pradhanmantri morarji desai kii ek galati se iskaa khulaasa ho gaya
 At that time RAW and Mossad were also working as secret missions
 kareeb 10 saal tak saath karne ke baad moraar ji desai kii ek chook ke baad yah sikret mishan khatm ho gaya
 After the 1984 assassination of Indira Gandhi, RAW began to face financial crisis
 is kaaran duusare deshon main uski khufia pakad dhili padi or bharat par suraksha khatra badhata chalaa gaya
 The ISI will be curbed! In the mid-1990s, the RAW was remodeled in view of political instability
 duusari taraf pakistan ne america madad se iesai teji se ubharne lagi
 The CIA began to provide all kinds of training to the ISI
 phir iske baad iesai ne jammu-kashmir main bharat ke khilaaf chhadam yuddh shuru kar diya
 Now the challenge on Raw has increased continuously in the changing times and in Modi Raj
 khufia jaankaree ke aadan-pradaan ko lekar bharat sarkaar or israel ke bich qaraar hua he
 Now it has to be seen what Raw and Mossad are able to do together
 mosaad iesai pryojit aatankwaad par ankush lagane ke liye bharat kaa kitna madadgaar sabit hota he, ye dekhne vaali baat hogi

 pronnati dene ke maamle main saavdhaanee barte bijepibijepi ke ek varisht saansad ne kaha ki aresas or bhaajapa ke bich teen dinon tak chale vichaar manthan ke daur ke bich yah mahasoos kiya gaya ki party main pravesh paane vaale kuch gaiyr sangh prishthbhumi ke logon ne satta, suvidha or pad kaa bhoga karne ke baad baad raturaat apana ruukh badal diya or kaha ki unka party ke saath buniyadi matbhed he
 The party is avoiding making a personal statement, it is understood that Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat asked the top leadership of the BJP to learn from such experiences and to be careful in promoting people outside the Sangh background
 bijepi se nishkasit netaa jaswant singh or varisht netaa laalkrishna adwani ke raajnneetik sahyogi sudhindra kulkarni aise do udhaaharan he jo sangh kii prishthbhumi ke nahin he or ve party ke aalochak ho gaye hai
 Although the BJP is criticizing the statements of Jaswant and Shourie, but is refraining from saying anything personally to them
 i had expected some financial assistance to important infrastructure projects for national capital
 Am disappointed that the center continues its step-motherly treatment to Delhi poor-farmer-laborer; Desperation of unemployed youth; Slap in the face of businessmen, women, jobbers and common people
 ye janata kii pareshaaniyon kii andekhi karne vaali ahamkaari sarkaar kaa vinaashkari bajet he
 Even in the last budget, the BJP showed that it is only the champion of the rich
 ab janata jawaab degi
 Disappointing # Budget2018
 Not a single extra rupee increased in Delhi’s share in Central taxes since 2001-02, stays at Rs 325 Cr
 No other part of India gets such treatment
 BJP govt at Center continues to treat Delhi residents as second-grade citizens
 n / 1 — Manish Sisodia (@msisodia) February 1, 2018 BJP govt at center continues to treat Delhi residents as second-grade citizens
 n / 1delhi police comes under Centre
 Yet no plans or schemes announced to tackle crime and issues of women safety that have made Delhi the crime capital of India
 Highly disappointing # Budget2018! n / 2 — Manish Sisodia (@msisodia) February 1, 2018 n / 2land in Delhi comes under center
 Yet no plans announced to regularise unauthorised colonies or give more land to Delhi govt to build clinics, schools, hospitals and bus depots
 Highly disappointing # Budget2018! n / 3I had personally requested a special package for 2000 electric buses for Delhi, which could have played a major role in combating air pollution
 Unfortunately, BJP govt does not care for Delhi
 n / 4 - Manish Sisodia (@msisodia) February 1, 2018 n / 4modi sarkaar ne dharaatal par kuch nahin kiya or naa hi kar rahi
 The government is only removing the details of the pakodas and jumalas on paper
 # Budget2018bajet main bihar ke liye kuch bhi nahin
 Bihar did not get anything on special package and special state status
 nitish kumaar bataae kya yahi unke liye dabl ingine he? nitish ji kii vajah se bijepi kii centre sarkaar bihar ke saath sautela vyavhaar kar rahi he
 The budget is a sham with the farmers
 gehun kaa nunatam samarthan mulya 1600rou prati quintal he lekin bazaar me us mulya par koi gehun kareedne vaala nahin he
 Forcing the farmer to sell wheat for 1300
 kiskaa dedh guna MSP dene kii baat he? vaataanukoolit cabinon main baithkar kisaanon kaa bhagya mat likhie
 The Modi government is absorbed in the cultivation of votes, leaving the concern of farmers to farming
 bijepi desh se kisaanon ko samaapt karnaa chaahati he
 The NPA of the capitalists is 10 lakh crores but the Modi government guarding the capitalists cannot forgive a few thousand crores rupees of 80 crores farmers
 kisaanon kii itani hi chintaa he to kyon nahin unka qarz maaf kar dete aay to usase bhi bad jaayegi
 After servicing the Capitalist, oligarch and Khas Aadmi for four years suddenly Govt feels that it can fool the farmer, the labourer, the small artisan, the salaried professional that it cares about them too in an election year
 Hell hath no fury like a nation scorned

 Sansaravati says, "for the last two months, the district has been pleading for compensation from the administration, but so far no one has come from the administration to assess the loss

 Whether Arvind Kejriwal or Congress candidate Ajay Rai all seem to be supporting each other in a tongue-in-cheek to defeat Modi
 vahiin, grahon kii chaal bhi modi or kursi kii duuri badha rahi he
 Opposition parties in Kashi are trying to mobilize against Modi
 mukhtaar ke bhai afjal ansaari ke elaan (modi ke khilaaf jo bhi party khadi hogi uskaa samarthan karenge) ke baad janata congress ke sthaneey ummidavaar ajay raay ko sabase pehle dekh rahi he to vahiin ajay raay bhi dabi jubaan main mukhtaar ke samarthan kaa swaagat kar rahe hai
 Ajay Rai says, 'the battle is of the earth versus the outsider
 jis din ajay raay kaa naam aayaa us din phija badal gai
 i understand that SP and BSP should support the Congress in the interest of the country
 varanasi kaa chunavi sameekaran bhi ab badalata hua najar aa rahaa he
 The people of Kashi also seem to give more attention to Ajay Rai than Modi, although the opinion of the people is also mixed
 kaashi ke rahul kehete hai, 'varanasi kii janata kii raay ajay raay he
 They are local and will benefit from it
 'grahon ke khel main siyaasi uthal-puthaldarasal, varanasi main modi kii musiibat yaheen khatm nahin hoti

 itnaa hi nahin unheen grahon kii kharaab chaal ke chalate modi ko pradhanmantri pad paane ke liye athak prayaas karnaa pad saktaa he
 Or it is possible that the Prime Minister's chair may go away from them

 Jupiter's ill-effects in the horoscope can generate thorns in the path of the PM post, along with their obstacles in the electoral path
 jyotishon kaa kahana he ki varanasi main modi ke nikatatam pratidwandi arvind kejariwal kii kundali main lagnesh kaa antar unke janamat sangrah ko or majboot bana rahaa he
 Along with this, the position of Ajay Rai's planets is also strong, which will work to influence Narendra Modi's votes somewhere
 kaashi ke jyotishiyon kaa daawa he ki yadi jald hi modi ne brihaspati kii puja nahin karwaai to unhen na sirf varanasi balki pradhanmantri kii kursi se bhi samjhauta karnaa pad saktaa he
 Pandit Kameshwar Upadhyay, astrologer and convener of All India Scholars Council, says, 'modi's horoscope has Raja Yoga
 unka jivan aparaajey sthiti he, lekin jivan main sangharsh rahegaa
 There is also an obstacle in becoming Prime Minister
 modi kii kundali ke dushprinaam se virdohi ek honge
 Rahu has such situations, but he will fight it
 ' jyotishcharya pandit rishi dvivedi kehete hai ki narendra modi, kejariwal or ajay raay kii kundali ek-duusare ko takkar de rahi he
 There is Raja Yoga in Modi's horoscope, but Jupiter of fifth house in transit is sitting in the eighth house which is creating obstacles

 Instead of hastening to put flowers on the faces of all the seated children, the natural stability of listening to the story would emerge
 'ek raja nirbansia the,' maa sunaaya karti thim, 'unke raaj main badi khushhaali thi
 People of all selections used to watch their work
 koi dukhi nahin dikhaai padataa tha
 The king had a queen like Lakshmi, beautiful in the moon and very sweet to the king
 raja rajkaaj dekhte or sukh se rani ke mahal main rahete
 'I had a king of my thoughts, King Jagapati! Then i had a tooth-biting friendship with Jagapathi, both of whom went to study in middle school
 donon ek-se ghar ke the, isliye barabari kii nibhati thi
 i passed matriculation and became a servant in a school and Muharrir at Jagapati town's lawyer
 jis saal jagapati muhrrir hua, usee varsh paas ke gaanv main uski shaadi hui, par aisi hui ki logon ne tamaasha bana dena chaha
 The girls had some belief that the girl would not leave after marriage
 byaah ho jayega or saatvin bhaanvar tab padegi, jab pehali vidaa kii saayat hogi or tabhi ladki apni sasuraal jaaegi
 Jagapathi's wife was a little educated, but who would meet the rut of the house! The procession returned without a daughter-in-law and the boys decided that now Jagpati would be married elsewhere, even with Kani-luli, but the girl would no longer be in the house
 lekin saal khatam hote-hote sab thik-thaak ho gaya
 The girls apologized and Jagapati's wife came to her in-laws
 jagapati ko jaise sab kuch mil gaya or saas ne bahu kii balaayiyaan lekar ghar kii sab chaabiyaan saunp deen, gruhasthi kaa dhang-baar samajha diya
 Jagpati's mother had been waiting since long
 unhone aaraam kii saans lee
 Time began to be cut in the worship, the afternoon passed in the courtyard of other houses
 par saans kaa rog tha unhen, so ek din unhone apni antim ghadiyaan ginate hue chanda ko paas bulaakar samajhaayaa tha - 'betaa, jagapati bade laad-pyaar kaa palaa he
 Since your father-in-law is no more, i have been fulfilling its small stubbornness, now take care
 ' phir rukkar unhone kaha tha, 'jagapati kisi laayak hua he, to rishtedaaron kii aankhon main karkane laga he
 Your father made a fool at the time of marriage, who did not leave you
 mere dushman devar-jethon ko mauka mil gaya
 Tumar made it clear that to get off now is to get his nose cut
 jagapati kaa byaah kya hua, un logon kii chaati par saanp lot gaya
 Thought, take the guise of respecting the house and dissolve it in color
 ab betaa, is ghar kii laaj tumhaari laaj he
 If you were your father-in-law today, it would be good
 
 
 ' kehete kehete maan kii aankhon main ansu aa gaye, or ve jagapati kii dekhbhaal use saunpkar sadaa ke liye maun ho gai thim
 An armaan went with them that even after waiting for four years, they could not feed in the lap
 or chanda ne man main sabar kar liya tha, yahi sochakar ki kul-devtaa kaa ansh to use jivan-bhar poojane ko mil gaya tha
 As the generosity is scattered all around the house, it keeps on showering
 use lagata, jaise ghar kii andheri, ekaant kothriyon main yah shant sheetaltaa he jo use bharamaa leti he
 The tinkle of all the houses of the house had settled in his ears, the creakiness of every door had become an identity
 'ek roj raja akhet ko gaye,' maan sunaati thim, 'raja akhet ko jate the, to saatven roj jarur mahal main laut aate the
 But when he went that time, the seventh day left, but the king did not return
 rani ko badi chintaa hui
 Rani went in search with a minister
 'or isi bich jagapati ko rishtedaari kii ek shaadi main janaa padaa
 He was married to his distant relative's brother Dayaram
 kah gaya tha ki dasven din jarur waapas aa jayega
 But on the sixth day, it was reported that on returning home the procession got robbed in Dayaram's house
 kisi mubir ne sari khabaren pahunchaa di thim ki ladakiwaalon ne dayaram kaa ghar sone-chaandi se paat diya he aakhir pushtaini jameendaar kii iklauti ladki thi
 The guests who came home were almost gone
 duusare roj jagapati bhi chalanevaala tha, par usee raat daaka padaa
 Young man, he believes in blood! When the dacoits fired the guns, everyone's bellies were tied up
 par jagapati or dayaram ne chaati thokkar laathiyaan uthaa leen
 Chaos erupted in the house
 phir sannata chaa gaya
 The robbers were firing equal number of bullets
 baahar kaa darwaja tut chukaa tha
 But Jagapati shouted boldly, 'these air guns will not be able to compete with these oil-batting sticks, young men
 'par daravaaje tad-tad tuutate rahe, or ant main ek goli jagapati kii jaangh ko paar karti nikal gai, duusari uski jaangh ke upar kuulhe main samaa kar rah gai
 When Chanda wept there, she cried and cried, Jagpati was in the hospital
 dayaram ke thodi chot ai thi
 He was discharged from the hospital
 jagapati kii dekhbhaal ke liye vahiin aspataal main marijon ke rishtedaaron ke liye jo kothriyaan baniin thim, unheen main chanda ko ruknaa padaa
 Dayaram's village used to be four curses from the town hospital
 duusare-tisare vahaan se aadmi aate-jate rahete, jis saamaan kii jarurat hoti, pahunchaa jate
 But gradually they also stopped taking news
 ek din main thik honevaala ghaav to tha nahin
 The thigh bone was clenched and the hip had a six-inch deep wound from the operation
 kasbe kaa aspataal tha
 The compounder used to take care of the patients
 bada doctor to naam ke liye tha yaa kasbe ke bade aadamiyon ke liye
 For the younger people, the Comporter was the incarnation of God
 marijon kii dekhbhaal karanevaale rishtedaaron kii khaane-pine kii mushkilon se lekar marij kii nabz tak sanbhaalate the
 The hospital was inhabited in a small building
 rogiyon kii sirf chha:-saat khaaten thi
 There was a medicine room adjacent to the patients' room, there was a lumbar on one side and a low table
 usee kursi par bada doctor aakar kabhi-kabhaar baithta tha, nahin to bachansingh compounder hi jame rahete
 In the hospital, either one or two people of foreclosure martyrs came or fell and broke their hands and feet
 chathe-chhamase koi aurat dikh gai to dikh gai, jaise unhen kabhi rog gherta hi nahin tha
 Sometimes, if someone fell ill, the householder would take eight to ten days of medicine together and then he would not even get the news of his life and death
 us din bachansingh jagapati ke ghaav kii pattee badalane aayaa
 There was such carelessness in his arrival and opening the bandage, as if the wrong band was opening the turban to tie it properly
 chanda uski kursi ke paas hi saans roke khadi thi
 He kept talking to more patients
 idhar minute-bhar ko dekhtaa, phir jaise abhyast-se uske haath apana kaam karne lagate
 The bandage was stuck with blood in one place, Jagapati groaned badly
 chanda ke munh se cheekh nikal gai
 When Bachsinh looked cautious, the dhoti in the face was trying to suppress his dreadful voice with his feet
 jagapati ekbargi machhlee-sa tadapakar rah gaya
 Bachchan Singh's fingers trembled a little that tears on his arm dripped from the drip
 bachansingh sihar-sa gaya or uske haathon kii abhyast nithuraai ko jaise kisi maanviya komalta ne dhire-se chhu diya
 In the environment of sighs, groans, painful screams, and screaming body, he was completely isolated, he used to suppress the ripened mangoes, peel the skin like a potato and feel the pain from his mind
 He was gone, it happened again today and he blushed like a child and started opening the bandage moist
 chanda kii ore dhire-se nigaah uthaakar dekhte hue fusfusaaya, 'ch
 
 
 Ch
 
 
 rogi kii himmat tut jaati he aise
 'but as he used to say this, his mind got upset with his own words
 yah beparwahee to cheekh or karahon kii ekresata se use mili thi, rogi kii himmat badhaane kii kartavyanishtha se nahin
 As long as he healed the wound, the compassion of any two eyes surrounded him
 or haath dhote samay vah chanda kii un chudiyon se bhari kalaayiyon ko bejhijak dekhtaa rahaa, jo apni khushi usase maang rahi thim
 Chanda was pouring water and Bachchan Singh was washing his hands, looking at his wrists, palms and feet
 dawaakhaane kii ore jate hue usne chanda ko haath ke ishaare se bulaakar kaha, 'dil chota mat karnaa jaangh kaa ghaav to das roj main bhar jayega, kuulhe kaa ghaav kuch din jarur legaa
 i will give the best medicine
 davaaiyaan to aisi hai ki murde ko changa kar den
 But we don’t come to the hospital, yet
 ''to kisi duusare aspataal se nahin aa saktin wo davaaiyaan?' chanda ne poocha
 'they can come, but the patient has to spend his money in them
 ' bachansingh ne kaha
 When Chanda remained silent, she spontaneously came out of Bachchan Singh's mouth, 'tell me if you need anything
 rahi davaaiyaan, so kahin na kahin se intjaam karke laa doongaa
 If you will come from the department, then it will take months to come
 shahar ke doctor se mangava doongaa
 They are in great need of medicines of strength
 acha, dekha jayega
 He stopped while saying
 chanda se kritagyata bhari najaron se use dekha or use laga jaise aandhi main udate pattey ko koi atkav mil gaya ho
 She came and sat down with Jagpati's cot
 uski hatheli lekar vah sahalaati rahi
 She kept pressing nails with her knuckles
 dhire-dhire baahar andheraa bad chalaa
 Bachan Singh brought an oil lantern and placed it in one corner of the patients' room
 chanda ne jagapati kii kalai daabate-daabate dhire se kaha, 'compounder sahab kah rahe the
 'and saying so, she fell silent to attract Jagapati's attention
 'kya kah rahe the?' jagapati anmane swar main bolaa
 "some medicines of strength are necessary for you!" i know
 ''par
 "look Chanda, feet can be spread like a sheet
" hamaari aukaat in dawaaiyon kii nahin he
 'man is seen for money, you are
 ''dekha jayega
 "the compounder will arrange it, i will tell him
 ''nahin chanda, udhaarkhaate se meraa ilaaj nahin hoga yaahe ek ke chaar din lag jaaen
 "in this
" ''tum nahin jaanateen, karj kodh kaa rog hota he, ek baar lagane se tan to galata hi he, man bhi rogi ho jaataa he
 ''but 
 
 
 ' kehete-kehete vah ruk gai
 Jagpati kept rolling on the other side to keep her point
 or tisare roj jagapati ke sirahaane kai takat kii davaaiyaan rakhi thim, or chanda kii thaharne vaali kothri main uske letne ke liye ek khaat bhi pahunch gai thi
 When the donation came, there were innumerable lines of mental anguish on Jagapati's face, as if he was fighting with his own soul besides fighting his illness, also getting entangled with the ignorance and affection of Chanda and above all the mercy of the one who helped Are you struggling with chanda ne dekha to yah sab sah na pai
 He came to his heart to say, have you never borrowed money from anyone till date? But you took it yourself and you did not have to accept it in front of me
 isiilie lete jhijak nahin lagi, par aaj mere saamne use sweekaar karte tumhaara jhootha paurush tilamilaakar jaag padaa he
 But the idol that had depth in the pain scattered on Jagapati's face, entered Chanda's mind like a thief, and she naturally shook her hand on the forehead and said, 'these medicines are not of any kind
 maine haath kaa kadaa bechney ko de diya tha, usee main ai hai
 "I didn't even ask
" 
 
 ' jagapati ne kaha or jaise khud man kii kamajori ko daab gaya - kadaa bechney se to acha tha ki bachansingh kii dayaa hi odh lee jaati
 And he also had slight regrets that undeservedly he used to say big things in rau, he would teach like knowledge
 or jab chanda andheraa hote uthakar apni kothri main sone ke liye jane ko hui, to kehete-kehete yah baat dabaa gai ki bachansingh ne uske liye ek khaat kaa intjaam bhi kar diya he
 When she came out of the room, she went straight to the closet and went straight to the dispensary with a hard hand, where Bachhan Singh was lying alone in the yellow light of the lamp with her legs spread comfortably on the doctor's chair
 jagapati kaa vyavhaar chanda ko lag gaya tha, or yah bhi ki vah kyon bachansingh kaa ahsaan abhi se lad le, pati ke liye jevar kii kitni aukaat he
 She sneaked into the dispensary
 din kii pahchaan ke kaaran use kamare kii mej-kursi or dawaaon kii almaari kii sthiti kaa anumaan tha, vaise cameraa andheraa hi padaa tha, kyonki lamp kii roshni keval apane vrutt main adhik prakashwan hokar konon ke andhere ko or bhi ghaneebhoot kar rahi thi
 Bachhan Singh recognized Chanda as soon as he entered
 vah uthakar khadaa ho gaya
 Chanda stepped inside, but was suddenly overwhelmed, as if she had automatically jumped into a dark well, a well that has been continuously diluted and in which the depth of the water has gone to the walls of the Hades
 She is drowning down, darkness gathering suffocating sin below! bachansingh ke saamne kshan-bhar main sari paristhiti kaundh gai or usne vahiin se bahut sanyat aawaaj main jabaan ko dabaate hue jaise vaayu main spasht dhvanit kar diya - 'chanda!' vah aawaaj itani be-aawaaj thi or nirarthak hote hue bhi itani sarthak thi ki us khamoshi main arth bhar gaya
 The donation stopped bachansingh uske paas jaakar ruk gaya
 The dense tree in front stood stunned, as if the circumference of its black shadow would spread once and cover them in its circle and free it the second
 dawaakhaane kaa lamp sahasaa bhabhakkar ruk gaya or marizon ke kamare se ek karaah kii aawaaj dur maidan ke chor tak jaakar dub gai
 Chanda rested himself while looking down, and said, 'I came to give you this bracelet
 ''to waapas kyon chali ja rahi thim?'chanda chup
 And after stopping for two moments, he slowly moved the gold bracelet of his hand towards her, as if this work was necessary despite not having the courage to give
 bachansingh ne uski sari kaaya ko ek baar dekhte hue apni ankhen uske sir par jamaa deen, uske upar pade kapade ke paar naram chiknayee se bhare lambe-lambe bal the, jinaki bhaap-si mahak failati ja rahi thi
 He said softly, 'bring it
 'chanda ne kadaa uski ore badha diya
 Taking a strong hand, he said, 'listen
 'chanda ne prashn-bhari nazren uski ore uthaa di
 Peeping into him, while holding his wrist with his hand, he put the bracelet on his wrist
 chanda chupchaap kothri kii ore chal di or bachansingh dawaakhaane kii ore
 The soot had grown badly and the black shadow of the tree standing in front had fallen
 donon laut gaye the
 But as something was left in that soot, it was left
 dawaakhaane kaa lamp jo jalte-jalte ek baar bhabhaka tha, usamen tel na rah jane ke kaaran batti kii lau bich se fat gai thi, uske upar dhuen kii lakeeren bal khaati, saanp kii tarah andhere main villin ho jaati thim
 In the morning when Chanda reached Jagpati and started to fix the bed, Jagpati felt that Chanda was very depressed
 kshan-kshan main chanda ke mukh par anginat bhav aa-ja rahe the, jinamein asamanjas tha, pidaa thi or nirihata thi
 a faint glow like a remorse made from the bottom of the heart after having committed an invisible sin? 'when the queen returned disappointedly with the minister, the king was present in the palace
 unki khushi kaa thikaana na rahaa
 'mother used to narrate,' but the king did not like the queen to go with the minister like this
 rani ne raja ko samajhaayaa ki vah to keval raja ke prati atoot prem ke kaaran apane ko na roak saki
 The king and queen wanted each other very much
 donon ke dilo main ek baat shul-si gadati rahati ki unke koi santaan na thi rajvansh kaa deepak bujhane ja rahaa tha
 In the absence of children, his public life was being spoiled and the fear of destroying the dignity of the family was increasing
 'duusare din bachansingh ne marijon kii maraham-pattee karte vakt bataaya tha ki uskaa tabadalaa mainpuri ke sadar aspataal main ho gaya he or vah parason yahan se chalaa jayega
 Jagapati listened, he felt good
 aae din rog ghere rahete hai, bachansingh uske shahar ke aspataal main pahunchaa ja rahaa he, to kuch madad milti hi rahegi
 After all, he will be fine and where will he go except for Mainpuri? But in the second moment his heart was filled with immense heaviness
 pataa nahin kyon, chanda ke astitv kaa dhyaan aate hi use is soochna main kuch aise nukile kaante dikhaai dene lage, jo uske sharir main kisi bhi samay chubh sakate the, jaraa-sa bekhbar hone par bindh sakate the
 And then in front of him, the Lakshmana-lines of the right of man began to tremble like a streak of smoke, and the demons of doubt hidden in the mind began to roam as a yogi
 or pandraa-bees roj baad jab jagapati kii haalat sudhar gai, to chanda use lekar ghar laut ai
 Jagapati was worth moving
 ghar kaa taala jab kholaa, tab raat jhuk ai thi
 And then the dark waterfall started in their street from the evening itself
 par gali main aate hi unhen laga, jaise ki vanvaas katkar rajdhani laute hon
 On the nook itself, Jamuna was throwing a surhi in the goldsmith's closet, with a streak of lantern lights strewn through the draped doors, and raw tobacco smoke was badly filled at the mouth of the gully street
 saamne hi munshiji apni jingla khatiya ke gaddhe main, kuppi ke maddhim prakaash main khasra-khatauni bichhaae mijaan lagane main mashgool the
 When the door of Jagapathi's house opened, her aunt in the darkness looked through her jungle and proclaimed sitting inside her house from there - 'kulman has returned from Raja Nirbansiya Hospital
 'ye shabd sunakar ghar ke andhere barothe main ghuste hi jagapati hanfakar baith gaya, jhunjhalaakar chanda se bolaa, 'andhere main kya mere haath-pair tudwaaogi? bheetar jaakar laalaten jala lao na
 "there will be no oil, just work like this at the moment
" ''tumhaare kabhi kuch nahin hoga na tel na
 While saying, Jagapati kept quiet
 or chanda ko laga ki aaj pehali baar jagapati ne uske vyarth maatrutiv par itani gahari chot kar di, jisaki gaharaai kii usne kabhi kalpana nahin kii thi
 The two went in silently without talking
 raat ke badhate sannaate main donon ke saamne do baaten thim-- jagapati ke kaanon main jaise koi vyangy se kah rahaa tha - raja nirbansia aspataal se aa gaye! or chanda ke dil main yah baat chubh rahi thi - tumhaare kabhi kuch nahin hoga
 And when sisakti-sisakti Chanda fell asleep
 par jagapati kii aankhon main neend na ai
 a seductive, frightening net spread around him lying on the cot
 lete-lete use laga, jaise uskaa swayan kaa aakaar bahut ksheen hota-hota bindu-sa rah gaya, par bindu ke haath the, pair the or dil kii dhadkan bhi
 The vaulted darkness of the cell, the beige walls and the deep cavernous cabinets, of which he looked again and again and rose up as if everything had been transformed
 use laga ki uskaa aakaar badhata ja rahaa he, badhata ja rahaa he
 He became a man, a tall and strong-hearted man, distraught to explode something in his veins
 uske haath sharir ke anupaat se bahut bade, daraavne or bhayanak ho gaye, unke lambe-lambe nakhun nikal aae vah rakshas hua, daitya hua aadim barbar!or badi tezi se sara cameraa ekbargi chakkar kaat gaya
 Then everything slowly started to settle down and her breathing became fine
 phir jaise bahut koshish karne par ghigghi bandh jane ke baad uski aawaaj phooti, 'chanda!'chanda kii naram sanson kii halki sarsaraahat kamare main jaan daalane lagi
 Jagapati bowed with support of her party
 kaanpate pair usne jameen par rakhe or chanda kii khaat ke paae se sir tikaakar baith gaya
 He felt as if the music of life was echoing in the voice of Chanda's breath
 vah uthaa or chanda ke mukh par jhuk gaya
 In that darkness, the eyes became wide-eyed, after a long time, the aura on the face of Chanda itself began to disintegrate automatically
 uske naksh ujjwal ho uthe or jagapati kii aankhon ko jyoti mil gai
 He looked enchanted
 chanda ke bikhare bal, jinamein haal ke janme bachche ke gabhuaare baalo kii-si mahak doodh kii kachindh sharir ke ras kii-si mithaas or sneh-si chikanahat or vah maathaa jis par baalo ke paas tamaam chote-chote, naram-naram-naram-se roen resham se or us par kabhi lagaai gai sendur kii bindi kaa halkaa mitaa hua-sa abhas nanhen-nanhen nirdvandv soe palak! or unki maasoom-si kaanton kii tarah barauniyaan or saans main ghulkar aati hui vah aatma kii nishkapat aawaaj kii lay phool kii pankhuri-se patale-patale onth, un par padi achhuti rekhaayen, jinamein sirf doodh-si mahak!uski aankhon ke saamne mamata-si chaa gai, keval mamata, or uske mukh se asfoot shabd nikal gaya, 'bacchee!'darate-darate uske baalo kii ek lat ko bade jatan se usne hatheli par rakhaa or ungali se us par jaise lakeeren khinchne laga
 He felt as if an infant had fallen asleep, flattering to get into his number
 usne donon hatheliyon ko pasarkar uske sir ko apni seemaa main bhar lenaa chaha ki koi kathor cheez uski ungliyon se takaraai
 He came to his senses
 bade sahare se usne chanda ke sir ke neeche tatola
 Something tied in a handkerchief came in his hand
 apane ko sanyat karata vah vahiin jameen par baith gaya, usee andhere main us rumal ko kholaa, to jaise saanp soongha gaya, chanda ke haathon ke donon sone ke kade usamen lipte the!or tab uske saamne sab sristi dhire-dhire tukade-tukade hokar bikharane lagi
 He was treating her hard by selling donations
 ve sab davaaiyaan or takat ke tonic usne to kaha tha, ye davaaiyaan kisi kii meharbaani nahin hai, maine haath ke kade bechney ko de die the par uskaa galaa buree tarah suukh gaya
 The tongue stuck to the palate like
 usne chaha ki chanda ko jhakazorkar uthaae, par sharir kii shakti bah-si gai thi, rakt pani ho gaya tha
 a bit restrained, he wrapped them in the same handkerchief and placed it on the corner of his cot and with great difficulty grabbed the bed of his cot and rolled it
 chanda jhooth boli! par kyon? kade aaj tak chhupaae rahi
 Why did he make such a big difference? But why? why? And Jagapati's heart became heavy
 use phir laga ki uskaa sharir simatata ja rahaa he or vah ek seenk kaa bana dhaanchaa rah gaya nitant halkaa, tinke-sa, hawa main udakar bhatakane vaale tinke-sa
 Every night after that night, Jagpati kept thinking that he should sell hard by asking for donations and start a small business only because the job was missed
 itane din kii gaiyrhaaziri ke baad vakil sahab ne doosraa muhrrir rakh liya tha
 He would think the same every day, but when the donation came, he would not know how helpless it would be
 use lagata, jaise kade mangekar vah chanda se patnitv kaa pad bhi chin legaa
 Motherhood has taken away motherhood, he thinks what will be the fund? If wifehood and motherhood were taken away from a woman, then what is the significance of her life? How can he do this injustice to Chanda? How to ask for another eye light from him? Then it will become absolutely blind and the history of whose soul will be bare after asking for those rings, how will it lend itself to that shame? Used to be kisi se udhaar le le? par kis sampatti par? kya he uske paas, jiske aadhaar par koi use kuch degaa? or muhalle ke log zo ek-ek pai par jaan dete hai, koi cheez kharidte vakt bhav main ek paisa kam milane par milon paidal jaakar ek paisa bachaate hai, ek-ek paise kii masaale kii pudiya bandhwaakar gyaarah martabaa paison kaa hisaab jodakar ekaadh paisa udharkar, minnaten karte sauda ghar laate hai; gali main koi khonchevala fas gaya, to do paise kii cheez ko lard-jhagadkar - chaar dane zyaada paane kii niyat se - do jagah bandhvaate hai
 They spend hours arguing for the slightest difference of sentiment, in the evening they bring rotten street-bearers due to economies, from whom they demand such people to stumble upon their feeling of poverty! But in the evening when they reach home in the evening , Then a bicycle was seen in the vest itself
 dimag par bahut jor daalane ke baad bhi vah aaagantuk kii kalpana na kar paaya
 When i reached the inner door, i suddenly stopped listening to laughter
 us hansee main ek ajeeb-sa unmaad tha
 And after that the voice of Chanda - 'now it will come, don't sit for two more minutes! Look with your own eyes and keep explaining to them that fitness is not worth it, who can tolerate day-to-day walking
 ''haan bhai, kamajori itani jaldi nahin mit sakati, khyal nahin karenge to nuksaan uthaayenge!' koi purush-swar tha yah
 Jagapati was in a dilemma
 vah ekadam bheetar ghus jaae? isamen kya harj he? par jab usne pair uthaae, to ve baahar ja rahe the
 As soon as he caught the bicycle in the vest outside, he came to know, from there, as the unknown made great efforts, he opened the voice and shouted, 'hey Chanda! Whose bicycle is this? Who kind 'chanda uski aawaaj sunakar kamare se baahar nikalakar jaise khush-khabari suna rahi thi, 'apane compounder sahab aae hai
 While searching, we have found the address of the house, sitting in your waiting
 ''koun bachansingh? acha acha
 i would say the same, who is it? ' kahata jagapati paas pahunchaa, or baton main is tarah ulajh gaya, jaise sari paristhiti usne sweekaar kar lee ho
 When Bachan Singh left, saying that he would come again, Chanda started talking in front of Jagapati very familiarly, 'know how many men are
 ''kyon, kya hua? kaise hote hai aadmi?' jagapati ne poocha
 'in such a small acquaintance, you can sit in the house of men without entering? You will come back in reverse
 ' chanda kahkar jagapati ke mukh par kuch icchit pratikriya dekh sakane ke liye gahari nigahon se taakane lagi
 Jagapati looked at Chanda as if to say or even ask for this! Then said, 'bachan Singh is a man of his kind, lonely of his kind
 'hoga par' kehete-kehete chanda ruk gai
 'there is a man who comes in handy at the time, but it is as easy as you can benefit from it, i mean that from whom something will be taken, it will also be given to him
 ' jagapati ne ankhen diwaar par gadaate hue kaha
 And Chanda got up and left
 us din ke baad bachansingh lagbhag roj hi aane-jane laga
 Jagpati would also roam around with him
 bachansingh ke saath vah jab tak rahata, ajeeb-si ghutan uske dil ko band leti, or tabhi jivan kii tamaam vishamtaayen bhi uski nigahon ke saamne ubharne lagatee, aakhir vah swayan ek aadmi he bekaar yah mana ki uske saamne pet paalane kii koi itani vikaraal samasya nahin, vah bhukhon nahin mar rahaa he, jaade main kaanp nahin rahaa he, par uske do haath-pair hai sharir kaa pinjraa he, jo kuch maangata he kuch! or vah sochataa, yah kuch kya he? sukh? shaayad haan, shaayad nahin
 He is accustomed to live in sorrow, a wonderful insect that can survive in the absence
 to phir vaasana? shaayad haan, shaayad nahin
 Taking Chanda's body, he has seen that momentaryness as well
 to phir dhan shaayad haan, shaayad nahin
 He has spent money for himself
 par vah bhi to us adrishy pyaas ko buja nahin paaya
 Then what? what then? What is it that keeps on snapping in his soul, seeking his treatment? Maybe work! Yes, this, exactly this, that does not leave the clocks of his life unsaid, in which he can exert his power, submerge his mind, feel himself meaningful, whether it is happiness or sorrow, safety or protection, exploitation Whether it is nutrition or not, he just needs work! Need something to do yahi to uski prakrut aavashyaktaa he, pehali or aakhri maang he, kyonki vah us ghar main nahin paidaa hua, jahaan sirf jabaan hilaakar shashan karanevaale hote hai
 He was not even born in the house where only the living are sought
 vah us ghar kaa he, jo sirf kaam karnaa jaanata he, kaam hi jisaki aas he
 Only he wants work, work
 or ek din uski kaam-dham kii samasya bhi hal ho gai
 Jagpati's wooden stall opened on the south side of the high ground of the pond
 board tak tang gaya
 Lakshmi-pujan was also done on the ground and havan was also done
 lakdi kii koi kami nahin thi
 Trains coming from the village were negotiated with the help of men who had been trafficked in this business
 gaanthen ek ore rakhi gayi, chelon kaa chatta karine se lag gaya or gudde chirane ke liye daal die gaye
 Dealing with two-three trains was halted
 bhavishya main swayan ped kharidkar kataane kaa tay kiya gaya
 Big schemes were made that how will one day make wooden wooden booths with burning wood
 chirane kii nai mashin lagegi
 When the business increases, Bachchan Singh will also leave the job and take it
 or usne mahasoos kiya ki vah kaam main lag gaya he, ab choubison ghante uske saamne kaam he uske samay kaa upyog he
 Throughout the day, he can be someone's friend for an hour, he can be a husband for a while, but the rest of the time? The lack of those hours for the rest of the day and night can only be done by him, and now he was a worker
 vah kaamadaar to tha, lekin jab taal kii us unchi jameen par pade chappar ke neeche takhat par vah galla rakhkar baithta, saamne lage lakadiyon ke dher, kate hue ped ke tane, jadon ko ludhaka hua dekhtaa, to ek nirihata barabas uske dil ko baandhane lagati
 He feels, the body of a vain vampire has been broken to pieces
 phir in par kulhadi chalegi or inke reshe-reshe alag ho jaayenge or tab inaki thathriyon ko sukhaakar kisi paisevaale ke haath tak par taulakar bech diya jayega
 And then his eyes would get stuck on the palm standing in front of him, fluttering on the big-necked vulture neck and sitting silent for long
 tad kaa kaala gadredaar tana or uske saamne thahari hui vaayu main nissahay kaanpati, bharahin neem kii pattiyaan chakaraati jhadati rahati dhul-bhari dharti par lakdi kii gadiyon ke pahiyon kii padi hui li dhundli-si chamak uthati or bagalvaale moongfalli ke pench kii ekares kharkharati aawaaj kaanon main bharne lagati
 Someone would pass through the rough footpath, descend from the slope of the mound into the bottom of the pond, whose garbage would float in the dirty water and the pig would put its mouth in the mud and trample it
 dopaher simatati or shaam kii dhundh chaane lagati, to vah laalaten jalaakar chappar ke khambhe kii keel main taang detaa or uske thodi hi der baad aspatalwali sadak se bachansingh ek kaale dhabbe kii tarah aata dikhaai padataa
 In the dark darkness, his size gradually increased and when he stood in front of Jagapati, he would feel very huge, in front of which he would feel his existence sinking
 ek-aadh bikri kii baaten hotin or tab donon ghar kii ore chal dete
 After reaching home, Bachchan Singh would stay for some time, sit, talk here and there
 kabhi mauka pad jaataa, to jagapati or bachansingh kii thali bhi saath lag jaati
 Chanda used to sit in front and feed them both
 bachansingh bolta jaataa, 'kya tarkari bani he
 The spice has been such that it too is out and the taste of Tarkari has not died
 hotalon main yaa to masala hi masala rahegaa yaa sirf tarkari hi tarkari
 Wow! Wow! What is the matter of speculation! ”and Chanda used to interject, saying,“ He does not fill his stomach until he finds onion roasted ghee in the lentils
 'yaa - 'sirka agar inhen mil jaae, to samajho, sab kuch mil gaya
 At first i did not know how to get vinegar, but now it has become such a tongue-in-cheek
 'yaa - 'inhen kaagaj-si patali roti pasand hi nahin aati
 Now if someone asks me to make thin bread, it does not get made, it has become a habit, and then the mind does not
 'par chanda kii ankhen bachansingh kii thali par hi jameen rahati
 The bread was disposed of, so the bread was served, and the lentils were not finished, but still a tablespoon and served
 or jagapati sir jhukaae khaataa rahata
 Just ask for a glass of water and before giving water to the donation, she would say, "oh, you haven't taken anything!" While saying, she would give water and then her heart would be deeply hurt, not knowing why she would suffer a lot of silence, but she could convince herself, there are no guests to ask
 bhukh nahin hogi
 Jagpati would eat and go to lie on the table, because no watchman had been found yet
 chappar ke neeche takht par jab vah letata, to anayas hi uskaa dil bhar-bhar aata
 i do not know which pains meet each other and start producing various types of tees, sputum and cramps
 koi ek rag dukhati to vah sahalaata bhi, jab sabhi nasen chatkhati hon to kahan-kahan raahat kaa akelaa haath sehalaye!lete-lete uski nigaah tad ke us ore bani pukhta kabr par jam jaati, jiske siraahne cantila babul kaa ekaaki ped sunn-sa khadaa rahata
 The tomb at which a gnarled woman used to come up in a big way in the morning and offered jams and jasmine flowers, wandered around her head and walked a few steps sadly and sadly and quickly lost herself in the locality of the chambers
 shaam hote phir aati
 a lamp would burn and if the lights would burn, then put a folded veil on the shoulders, the flame of the lamp would have shivered, never quenched, but its steps would have gone, at first slow, tired, sad, and then fast normal
 -S
 or vah phir usee muhalle main kho jaati or tab raat kii tanhaayiyon main babul ke kaanton ke bich, us saany-saany karte unche-neeche maidan main jaise us kabr se koi ruh nikalakar nipat akeli bhatakati rahati
 Then the vultures with the ruddy neck sitting on the palm rose in a murmur-like voice and the palm leaves were awakened with horror
 jagapati kaa badan kaanp jaataa or vah bhatakati ruh jinda rah sakane ke liye jaise kabr kii eenton main, babul ke saaye-tale dubak jaati
 Jagpati would lie down with her legs hidden from the stomach, hiding her face with a blanket
 tadake hi theke par lage lakadahare lakdi chirane aa jate
 Then Jagapati draped the blanket, walked towards the house
 'raja roj savere tahalne jate the,' maan sunaaya karti thim, 'ek din jaise hi mahal ke baahar nikalakar aae ki sadak par jhaadoo lagaanevaali mehtaraani unhen dekhte hi apana jhaadoopanja patakekar maathaa peetane lagi or kehane lagi, 'hai ram! aaj raja nirbansia kaa munh dekha he, na jane roti bhi naseeb hogi ki nahin na jane koun-si vipat tut pade!' raja ko itnaa du:kha hua ki ulte pairon mahal ko laut gaye
 He ordered the minister to fill the house of that Mehtarani with pride
 or sab rajasi vastra utaar, raja usee kshan jangal kii ore chale gaye
 The same night the queen had a dream that tomorrow night will fulfill your wish
 rani bahut pachhataa rahi thi
 But immediately the queen, searching for the king, reached the inn where he was staying
 rani bhes badalakar seva karne vaali bhatiyaarin banakar raja ke paas raat main pahaunchi
 Stayed with them overnight and left the inn before the king woke up and returned to the palace
 raja subah uthakar duusare desh kii ore chale gaye
 Within two days, the news of the king's departure spread throughout the kingdom, the king left, this was the news all around
 'or us din tole-muhalle ke har aangan main barsaat ke meh kii tarah yah khabar baraskar fail gai ki chanda ke bal-baccha hone vaala he
 Finkti Surhi stayed in Jamuna Goldsmith's cell at Nukkad
 munshiji ne apana mijaan lagaana chhod visfaarit netron se takkar khabar suni
 Bansi grocer pulled half of the well from the well, and heard the dole slammed into the mind
 sudarshan darji ne mashin ke pahie ko hatheli se ragadkar rokkar suna
 Hansraj Punjabi overheard his nymph embroidered Malaguji shirt
 or jagapati kii bevaa chachee ne auraton ke jamghat main bade vishwaas, par bhed-bhare swar main sunaaya - 'aaj chah saal ho gaye shaadi ko na bal, na baccha na jane kiskaa paap he uske pet main
 And who will be there except that mustard vibrator! Do not know where Kulchini came to this locality! The streets of this street have been so depressed that the shadow of a non-male woman could not be seen then
 yahan ke mard to bas apane ghar kii auraton ko jaanate hai, unhen to padosi ke ghar kii jananiyon kii ginati tak nahin maaloom
 While saying this, her face turned red and all the women became as serious as the goddesses of the heavens, slowly slipping from the burden of the greatness of their holiness
 subah yah khabar failane se pehle jagapati taal par chalaa gaya tha
 But she also listened today
 din-bhar vah takht par kone kii ore munh kiye padaa rahaa
 Neither the wood of the contract was crushed, nor did he pay attention to the sale, nor went home to eat lunch
 jab raat acchhee tarah fail gai, vah hinsak pashu kii bhaanti uthaa
 He licked his fingers, saw the force of the arm by folding it, then the veins tightened and there was a strong vibration in the arm
 usne teen-chaar puri saansen khinchin or majboot kadamon se ghar kii ore chal padaa
 The field was over, the road of Kakar came, the road was over, the street came
 par gali ke andhere main ghuste hi vah saham gaya, jaise kisi ne adrishy haathon se use pakadakar sara rakt nichod liya, uski fatty hui shakti kii nas par him-sheethal hont rakhkar sara ras chus liya
 And the hue and cry of the darkness of the street became even heavier, entering it would stop his breath
 vah peeche muda, par ruk gaya
 Then, after getting some rest, he somehow reached the inner door of the house with silent steps like thieves
 dayee ore kii rasoivaali dahalij main kuppi timatimaa rahi thi or chanda ast-vyast-si diwaar se sir teke shaayad aasmaan nihaarte-nihaarte so gai thi
 The light of the flask had exposed half of his face and half of his face was invisible immersed in intense Kalima
 vah khamoshi se khadaa takata rahaa
 The maturity of femininity appeared on Chanda's face today
 chehre kii sari kamaniyata na jane kahan kho gai thi, uskaa achootapan na jane kahan lupt ho gaya tha
 Puffed mouth
 jaise tahani se tode phool ko pani main daalkar tazaa kiya gaya ho, jisaki pankhuriyon main tuutan kii surmai rekhaayen pad gai hon, par bhigane se baaripan aa gaya ho
 When he looked at his open leg, he felt swollen
 ediyaan bhari, suji-si or nakhunon ke paas ajab-sa suukhaapan
 Jagpati's heart once woke up
 usne chaha ki badhkar use uthaa le
 Touch your entire body with your hands and wipe the whole lotus, purify it once again by burning it in the breath of your breath, and look into the depths of his eyes and say - What curse has you exiled from Devloka, come here? This curse was indelible
 tabhi chanda ne hadabadaakar ankhen kholin
 On seeing Jagpati in front, she felt that she had become completely naked
 atishay lajjit ho usne apane pair samet liye
 Dhoti moved down from her knees and got very moderate and got lost in the kitchen darkness
 jagapati ekadam hataash ho, vahiin kamare kii dehri par choukhat se sir tikaa baith gaya
 When the eye went into the room, it seemed that the foreign voices are echoing here, of which Chanda is also one
 ek taraf ghar ke har kone se, andheraa sailaab kii tarah badhata aa rahaa tha ek ajeeb nistabdhta asamanjas
 Speed, but misguided! Bones, but shapeless
 'khaanaa kha lete,' chanda kaa swar kaanon main padaa
 He unknowingly got up as if ready
 uski baat kii aaj tak usne avagya na kii thi
 i sat down to eat, but Kaur was not moving down
 tabhi chanda ne bade sadhe shabdon main kaha, 'kal main gaanv janaa chaahati hoon
 'as he was familiar with this information, he said,' Good
 'chanda phir boli, 'maine bahut pehle ghar chitthee daal di thi, bhaiya kal lene aa rahe hai
 ''alright then
 ' jagapati vaise hi duba-duba bolaa
 Chanda's dam broke and she wept right there on her knees and wept bitterly
 na uth saki, na hill saki
 Jagati was distracted momentarily, but as if to freeze
 uske oth fadake or krodh ke jwalamukhi ko jabaran dabaate hue bhi vah foot padaa, 'yah sab mujhe kya dikhaa rahi he? besharm! begairat! us vakt nahin sochaa tha, jab jab meri laash tale
 "then the other thing is a lie
 ', sisakiyon ke bich chanda kaa swar phuta, 'lekin jab tumne mujhe bech diya
 'A full hand lit a fire on the temple's canopy
 or jagapati apni hatheli duusari se dabta, khaanaa chhod kothri main ghus gaya or raat-bhar kundi chadhaae usee kaalikh main ghutata rahaa
 The next day Chanda left home and went to her village
 jagapati puraa din or raat taal par hi kaat detaa, usee biraane main, talab ke bagal, kabr, babul or tad ke pados main
 But the mind was dead
 jabardastee vah apane ko vahiin roke rahata
 He would have a heart, leave somewhere
 par aisi kamazori uske tan or man ko khokhla kar gai thi ki chaahane par bhi vah ja na paata
 Hikrat-filled eyesight, but remains there
 kaaphi dinon baad jab nahin rah gaya, to ek din jagapati ghar par taala laga, najadik ke gaanv main lakdi kataane chalaa gaya
 He felt that he was paralyzed now, completely lame, a creeping worm, which had neither eyes, nor ears, nor minds, nor desires
 vah us baag main pahunch gaya, jahaan kharide ped katane the
 The two men placed the saw on the trunk of a thin tree, and the noise of carr-and-carr began to erupt
 duusare ped par banne or shakure kii kulhadi baj uthi
 And away from the village a rhythmic noise started in that garden
 jad par kulhadi padati to puraa ped tharra jaataa
 Jagpati's body, sitting on the ridge of the nearby field, also trembled
 chanda ne kaha tha, 'lekin jab tumne mujhe bech diya
 'was she right! Did the interest paid for the money that Bachhan Singh had given for avoiding? Did only those rupees become fire, in which his long-suffering, faith and ideals melted out of wax? Someone put a voice on the hedge attached to the garden
 shakure ne kulhadi rokkar vahiin se haak lagaai, 'kone ke khet se li bani he, jaraa med markar nangha laa gaadi
 Jagapati was distracted
 usne mudakar dade par ankhen gadaayin
 Two buffalo-carts had arrived to fill the wood
 shakure ne jagapati ke paas aakar kaha, 'ek gaadi kaa bhar to ho gaya, balki dedh kaa ab is pataria ped ko na chhant den?'jagapati ne us ped kii ore dekha, jise kaatane ke liye shakure ne ishaara kiya tha
 The branch of the tree was full of green leaves
 vah bolaa, 'are, yah to haraa he abhi ise chhod do
 "what if it is green, it is ruined
" na phool kaa, na fal kaa
 Now who will bear fruit in it, the leaf will fall in four days
 ' shakure ne ped kii ore dekhte hue ustadi andaaj se kaha
 "just as you think," Jagapati said, and got up and went to the water to drink water at the well padded well
 dopaher dhalate gaadiyaan bharkar taiyaar huin or shahar kii ore ravaanaa ho gayi
 Jagapati had to come with him
 gaadiyaan lakdi se ladenn shahar kii ore chali ja rahi thim or jagapati gardan jhukaae kachi sadak kii dhul main duba, baari kadamon se dhire-dhire unheen kii bajati ghantiyon ke saath nirjeev-sa badhata ja rahaa tha
 'many years later, after earning a lot of money from King Pardes, he returned to his country in a carriage,' Mother used to say, 'the wheel of the king's car got entangled in the bush of the address at some distance from the palace
 har tarah koshish kii, par pahiyaa na niklaa
 Then a priest told that if the child born on the day of 'sakat' brought the betel nut to his house and touched it, the wheel would go out
 vahiin do balak khel rahe the
 When he heard this, he jumped up and started saying that our birth has been severed, but the betel nut will be brought when you promise to give half the money
 raja ne baat maan lee
 The boys ran and ran to the house
 supaari laakar chuaa di, phir ghar kaa rasta bataate aage-aage chale
 He finally stopped the car in front of the palace
 raja ko bada achraj hua ki hamaare hi mahal main ye do balak kahan se aa gaye? bheetar pahunche, to rani khushi se behaal ho gai
 'but the king first asked about those boys, then the queen said that these two boys are their princes
 raja ko vishwaas nahin hua
 The queen was very sad
 'gaadiyaan jab taal par aakar lageen or jagapati takhat par haath-pair deele karke baith gaya, to pagadendi se guzarate munshiji ne uske paas aakar bataaya, abhi us din vasuuli main tumhaari sasuraal ke najadik ek gaanv main janaa hua, to pataa laga ki pandraa-bees din hue, chanda ke ladkaa hua he
 'and then as he covered the hearings in the locality, he said,' It is late in the kingdom of God, not blind, Jagapati Bhaiya! 'jagapati first heard him staring at Munshiji with deep eyes, but he aimed his arrow
 Could not find exactly
 par sab kuch sahan karte hue bolaa, 'der or andher donon hai!''andher to saraasar he ghairia charittar he sab! bade-bade haar gaye hai,' kehete-kehete munshiji ruk gaye, par kuch is tarah, jaise koi badi bhed-bhari baat he, jise unki gol hoti hui ankhen samajha dengi
 Jagapati kept looking at Munshi ji
 minute-bhar manahuus-sa maun chaaya rahaa, use todate hue munshiji badi dard-bhari aawaaj main bole, 'sun to liya hoga, tumne?''kya?' kehane ko jagapati kah gaya, par use laga ki abhi munshiji us gaanv main faili baton ko hi badi bedardi se kah daalenge, usne naahak poocha
 Then Munshiji said, while taking his mouth near her nose, 'chanda is sitting at someone else's house
 par baccha diwaar ban gaya he
 If they want to, then if they die, the way is open, but Ramji's wish
 suna he, baccha rahete bhi vah chanda ko baitaane ko taiyaar he
 'jagpati's breath got stuck in her throat
 bas, ankhen munshiji ke chehre par patharai-si jadi thim
 Munshiji said, 'you can get a child from the court
 ab kaahe kaa sharam-lihaaj!''apana kahkar kis munh se maangoon, baba? har taraf to karj se dabaa hoon, tan se, man se, paise se, izzat se, kiske bal par duniya sanjone kii koshish karuun?' kehete-kehete vah apane main kho gaya
 Munshiji sat there
 jab raat jhuk ai to jagapati ke saath hi munshiji bhi uthe
 Put his hands on his shoulder, they brought him to the street
 apni kothri aane par peeth sahalaakar unhone use chhod diya
 He bowed his neck and walked in the darkness of the street, immersed in the same thoughts as if nothing had happened
 par kuch aisa boj tha, jo na sochane detaa tha or na samajhane
 When the aunt started passing by the meeting, she suddenly got a buzz in her ears - 'satyanasi has come! Kullaboran! 'he looked at it a little, then the aunts of the street gathered in the meeting and discussed Chanda
 par vah chupchaap nikal gaya
 After so many days, the lock was opened and there was no thought in the dark of the vest, so suddenly that night he wandered in front of his eyes when he returned from the hospital with donations
 bevaa chachee kaa vah jehar-bujh tir, 'aa gaye raja nirbansia aspataal se
 'and today' Satyanasi! Kulboran! ' And his sentence itself, which pierced Chanda, 'you will never have anything
 ' or us raat kii shishu chanda!chanda kaa ladkaa hua he
 She did not give birth to anything else, child of man
 vah or kuch bhi janati, kankad-pathar! vah nari na banati, bacchee hi bani rahati, us raat kii shishu chanda
 But what is Chanda going to do with all this? She is going to sit at someone else's house while she is alive? Chanda has been pushed into such a great sin, but he too must think something
 aakhir kya? par mere jite-ji to yah sab acha nahin
 He is willing to live with such hatred, or to burn me
 vah mujhe neech samajhati he, kaayar nahin to ek baar khabar to leti
 Would have known if the child was born
 par nahin, vah uskaa koun he? koi bhi nahin
 Aulad is the axis of affection that keeps the wheels of man and woman and crosses the swamp of the body, otherwise every woman is a prostitute and every man is a worm of lust
 to kya chanda aurat nahin rahi? vah jarur aurat thi, par swayan maine use narak main daal diya
 That child is none of mine, but the donation is mine
 ek baar use le aata, phir yahan raat ke mohak andhere main uske phool-se adharon ko dekhtaa nirdvandv soe palkon ko niharta yaason kii doodh-si achhuti mahak ko samet letaa
 Today's darkness! There is no oil in the house to light a lamp
 or phir kiske liye koun jalaae? chanda ke liye par use to bech diya tha
 What property did Chanda have with him, on the basis of which someone would give a loan? If debt is not available, how will all this work? Where are the work trees cut? And then those words of Shakure echoed in his ears, 'what is green, it is ruined
 ' vah swayan bhi to ek ukhta hua ped he, na fal kaa, na phool kaa, sab vyarth hi to he
 Never believed what he thought
 chanda ko chahta rahaa, par uske dil main chahat na jagaa paaya
 Scolded her for asking for a penny from somewhere, but kept taking it herself and today she is sitting at another's house except that she is alone, a burden on her side, her veins are being crushed, the rash is torn 
 or vah kisi tarah tatol-tatolkar bheetar ghar main pahunchaa
 'the queen reached the temple of her patriarch,' Mother used to recite, 'she did austerities to prove her saintliness
 raja dekhte rahe
 The patriarchs were pleased and by their divine power, they transformed both the children into immediate born infants
 rani kii chatiyon main doodh bhar aayaa or unamem se dhar foot padi, jo shishuon ke munh main girane lagi
 The king finds evidence of the queen's sobriety
 unhone rani ke charan pakad liye or kaha ki tum devi ho! ye mere putr hai! or us din se raja ne phir se raaj-kaaj sambhaal liya
 'but on the same night, Jagapathi died by abandoning all his business, drinking opium and oil, because Chanda had no divine power and Jagapati was the debtor of the Bachhan Singh compounder, not the king
 'raja ne do baaten kin,' maan sunaati thim, 'ek to rani ke naam se unhone bahut bada mandir banwaaya or duusare, raaj ke nae sikkon par bade rajkumaar kaa naam khudwakar chaalu kiya, jisase raaj-bhar main apane uttaradhikari kii khabar ho jaae
 Jagapati left two pamphlets while dying, one in the name of Chanda, the other in the name of law
 chanda ko usne likhaa tha, 'chanda, meri antim chaah yahi he ki tum bachche ko lekar chali aana abhi ek-do din meri laash kii durgati hogi, tab tak tum aa sakogi
 Chanda, a man not a sin, repents, i was dead long ago
 bachche ko lekar jarur chali aana
 'he wrote the law,' no one has killed me, no man has
 main jaanata hoon ki mere jehar kii pahchaan karne ke liye meraa seenaa chira jayega
 It contains poison
 maine opium nahin, rupe khaae hai
 Those rupees were poisoned by debt, that has killed me
 meri laash tab tak na jalaai jaae, jab tak chanda bachche ko lekar na aa jaae
 Fire should be administered to the child
 bas
 'when the mother finished the story, the children sitting around offered flowers

 The controversial statement of senior party leader LK Advani remained a topic of discussion at the Chintan meeting of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Uttar Pradesh unit in Agra on Sunday
 bhaajapa ke purv rashtriya adhyaksh rajnath singh ne kaha ki 2014 main pradhanmantri bhaajapa kaa hi hoga
 Rajnath Singh told reporters, 'our aim will be to get BJP a clear majority
 purna bahumat kii sthiti main bhi haalanki sarkaar rashtriya janatantric gathbandhan (rajg) kii hogi
 He said that the BJP will emerge as the largest party in 2014 and the Prime Minister will belong to the BJP

 Naqvi said, "there is no infighting in the BJP nor the NDA regarding the post of Prime Minister
 ham milakar puri shakti se chunaav ladenge or sarkaar banaaenge
 Earlier, on his blog on Sunday, Advani surprised his own party by accepting that a non-bjp and non-congress prime minister could come out in the 2014 general election
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki loksabhaa main congress kii sadsy sankhya ghatakar 100 se bhi neeche aa jaaegi

 Regarding this film, Salmal Agha said, "I am proud that our film Nikah gets the credit for ending the practice of triple talaq

 Dhoni has been found guilty by the match referee for violating Level 2 of the code of conduct

 It did not take long for Rani Mukerji and Anushka Sharma to speak candidly about Yash Raj Films and each other
 donon is production house se judi rahi hai
 Rani Mukerji is married to Yash Raj Films owner and filmmaker Aditya Chopra, who gave Anushka her first chance in Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi
 lekin yash raaj films ke alaava donon main kai duusari samanthaayen bhi hai, masalan donon ko unki maa se puraa sahyog mila, donon vinodpriy hai, donon swatantra vichaaron kii hai
 Both are confident but do not have Dambharani: i have heard from my husband (aditya Chopra) that you did not watch Hindi movies very much when you became an actress
 aapane rab ne bana di jodi (2008) ke liye audishan diya tha or mujhe yaad he, aapkaa audishan dekhakar maine kaha tha, ''maai god, is ladki main kitni chamak he
 "I would not say that you were beautiful
" lekin aapke kaam main kuch khaas baat thi, aapaki personality main kuch tha, jo umang se bharpoor or aakarshak tha
 Anushka: Thank God, you also saw this
 raniah aapane abhinetri banane kaa faisla kaise liya?anoushkah mujhe yaad he, aapse bhi kisi ko yah sawaal poochhate hue suna tha ki kya aap padhai main acchhee thim
 And you said yes
 aapane yah bhi kaha tha ki aapako
 
 
 Rani: 
 
 padhuya bahut acha lagata tha
 Anushka: You used to get good numbers too
 yah duusari baat he jo ham donon main kaaman he
 By the way, i did not have a special dream in childhood
 raniah par kya aapako bhi vaisaa hi mahasoos hota tha jaisaa main hameshaa mahasoos karti thi—main nahin jaanati thi ki main koun-sa rasta chunun
 But i definitely knew that i wanted to succeed
 anoushkah or main yah baat kisi ko samajha nahin sakati thi lekin mujhe pataa tha ki mujhe life main kuch bananaa he
 Rani: Yes, you cannot tell exactly what you want to become
 
 
 anoushkah vah ek instinct hota he naa, to mujhe lagata tha ki main bahut kaamyaab shakhsiyat banuungi
 But what, it was not known
 ek baar aadi ne mujhase ajeeb sawaal poocha tha, ''kya aap padhai main bahut acchhee thim?''raniah (hansatii hai)anoushkah isliye aadi jab sawaal poochhate hai to mujhe aashcharya nahin hota kyonki ve kuch bhi puch sakate hai
 i said, "yes
 main pehali yaa duusari pojishan par aati thi
 "then he said," Okay
 
 
 tabhi to tum itani acchhee ho
 "I started thinking what they are saying! Rani: What does it mean?" anoushkah aaj main samaj sakati hum ki unka kya matlab tha
 i think i was always a successful girl
 skool main kisi khel main hissaa leti to usamen bhi khaasaa acha parform karti
 Rani: We used to play only throwball in our school
 anoushkah main kolaj banane ke compitishan main bhi hissaa leti to sabase aage rahanaa chaahati thi
 So i think there was something that was driving me
 meri maa bhi mujhe bahut protsaahit karti rahati thim
 i think my mother sent my photo to people for the first time
 raniah meri maa or aapaki maa ko ek-duusare se milanaa chahie
 Anushka: For a long time i did not realize how i got into films
 kisne mere dimag main iskaa beej bo diya? kyonki maine sochaa tha ki main model banuungi
 i think he too came to my mind somewhere due to my mother
 raniah main aapako badi mjedaar baat bataati hum
 My grandmother is a very fast-paced woman
 meri maa ne 13 saal kii umr main mohammad rafee ke saath stage par gaanaa shuru kar diya tha
 Everyone from my mother's family has lived in the art field
 koi rabindranath tagore ke santhaan se judaa he, meri sabase choti mausi kolkata main abhinetri hai
 So from the very day i was born, my grandmother started preparing that she would make me an actress
 abhinetri banane tak yah baat main bilkul nahin jaanati thi
 She used to tell my mother, "krishna your daughter is very beautiful
 hamen use abhinetri bananaa chahie
 "it is very strange that all my inspiration has always been received from my mother's family
" maine us samay shuruyaat kii jab chijen badal rahi thim, sitare aasmaan se utar chuke the
 They became like those shining plastic stars that you place in the ceiling of a child's bedroom
 filmi sitare adhik sahaj ho chuke the, aap unase bade aaraam se mil sakate hai
 They have not descended from the sky, but ordinary people like us
 anoushkah to vyaayaam ke liye ghar se nikalne ke dauraan aap se log mil sakate the or aapaki photo khinch sakate the
 Rani: It was not like before
 aaj main sochati hum ki jo fain hamen pyaar bhare patr likhaa karte the, ve ab nafrat bhare patron ke gavaah jaise ho gaye hai
 Artists are abused on social media
 shukr he, main unase bachi hui hum
 Probably because i am married to a very lonely person
 anoushkah jo ek myth ho sakate hai
 Rani: Yes, they can be a myth
 anoushkah aapaki beti hi he jisaki vajah se log sochate honge ki aapaki jindagi main aadi bhi hai
 Rani: (laughs) They are not Mr
 India
 isiilie main jaan-boojhkar soshal media par nahin hum kyonki jab aap soshal media par hote hai to yah chunaav nahin kar sakate ki aap sirf apane prashansakon se hi baat karen
 You also have to reply to those who follow you, read your tweets or want to know your personal things there
 aaj main shaadishuda hum, meri ek bacchee he or main apane pati par dabaav daal kar nahin kah sakati ki ve media se dur na rahen or kya main unke saath apni photo post kar sakati hum
 i have no problem giving my pictures round the clock because i am in this field and i am used to it
 lekin main achaanak is baat kii jimmedaari nahin le sakati ki mere pati yaa meri beti kii tasviren prakashit kii ja rahi hai
 i can't do that because his father also makes some decisions about him
 lekin main yah samaj sakati hum ki aaj kalakaaron ko kis tarah dabaav jhelana padataa he kyonki lagaataar un par najar rakhi jaati he
 Today you can not even imagine that someone will wear a sandal to board the flight (people will not take notice)
 aaj stylist hote hai jo airport jate samay bhi aapke pahanaave kaa dhyaan rakhte hai
 i laugh a lot at this
 anoushkah lekin aap jaanati hai ki in sabase mujhe kitni raahat hui he? tab maine faisla liya ki is par gussa jaahir nahin karuungi
 Rani: Does your stylist tell you which bag you should carry at the airport? Anushka: No, but some people make fun of me why i carry the same type of bag or why i wear the same kind of shoes
 sach baat to yah he ki main in baton par dhyaan hi nahin detii
 Rani: No, i just want to understand
 mumbai main hamaare ghar itane chote hai ki itane saare bag-juute rakhenge kahaan
 Can you wear it but will you keep it? Anushka: i have made my life full of simplicity
 main kaale rang ke kapade pahenti hum
 Rani: You wear black
 (hansatii hai)raniah lekin main hameshaa sochati hum ki aakhir kya tuk he? airport security par belt, boot utaarna padataa he na
 Anushka: i am so afraid of officers that she cannot do everything
 raniah maine kuch kalakaaron ke bare main suna he jo soshal media ke kaaran depressant main chale gaye
 Because what is written about them, they take it very seriously and start accepting them as true
 anoushkah mumkin he
 When i started reading negative things about myself, i too took time to understand what he meant
 raniah par mere samay main kitna acha tha ki koi mujhe gaaliyaan dene ke liye postal stamp kharidne par paisa barbaad nahin karata tha na? The stock market opened on Tuesday after closing below the red mark on the first day of this trading week

 PUBG Mobile Club open-pmco kaa final 14 or 15 june ko hua tha
 While the world was watching the india-pakistan match on the one hand, Team Sol won by defeating 15 teams
 bharat ne ek lambey vakt ke baad great britain ko 2-1 se haraakar world hockey lig finels toornament ke semifinal main jagah bana lee he
 Prior to the match, the information and figures were definitely considered heavy in England, but Team Hockey India proved it wrong
 toornament main ye bharat kii pehali jeet he, lekin ek behad aham mukaable main world ranking main nambar-6 bharat ne world ranking main nambar-4 team ko 2-1 se haraakar dikhaa diya ki usamen abhi bahut dam he or uskaa khel khatm nahin hua he
 The amazing thing is that India lost to England (in World Hockey League semi-finals, Antwerp) 1–5 in the last match between the two teams and finished fourth in the tournament
 england ke coach bob krachali ne match se pehle kaha bhi tha, "unhone (bharat ne) germany ke khilaaf acha khel dikhaaya
 Although this team could not play well against Holland and Argentina, but this team will definitely do well in the quarter-finals and play a tough match
 "tippaniyan The Indian team did this
 bharat ne great britain ke khilaaf kai haar kaa badla le liya, wo bhi ek aham toornament main or bade hi style se
 Goals from VR Raghunath (19th minute) and Talwinder Singh (39th minute) gave India a big win
 great britain kii ore se iklauta gol simon mantel ne 52wein minute main kiya
 This gap of the balls remained till the end
 ek khaas baat ye bhi he ki is match ke pehle teen quarter main bhartiya khilaadiyon ne total hockey khelkar sabko prabhavit kiya
 These players missed some opportunities
 ek phikr kii baat aakhri lamhon main khud par dabaav banane kii dikhi jisapar kaam karne kii jarurat he, lekin agar coach rolant aultmans kii team aisa hi khelti rahi to bhartiya hockey kii baar-baar tuutati saanson ko dam mil saktaa he
 This is India's first win in the tournament, but in a very important match, number 6 in the world rankings, India defeated the number-4 team 2-1 in the world ranking, it showed that it still had a lot and its game was not over
 is
 kamaal kii baat yah he ki bharat, donon tiimon ke bich hue pichley match main england se (world hockey lig semifinal, entwarp main) 1-5 se haara tha or toornament main chauthe number par rahaa tha
 England coach Bob Crutchley also said before the match, "he (india) showed a good game against Germany
 haalanki, holland or argentina ke kilaaf ye team acha khel nahin dikhaa pai, lekin ye team quarter final main apana str yakeenan acha karegi or kadaa muqabla khelegi
 "comments bhartiya team ne ye kar dikhaaya
 India avenged many defeats against Great Britain, that too in an ego tournament and with great style
 viaar raghunatha (19wein minute main) or talvinder singh (39wein minute main) ke golon ne bharat ko ek badi jeet dilaa di
 Simon Mantel scored the only goal from Great Britain in the 52nd minute
 golon kaa ye antar akhir tak bana rahaa
 One special thing is that in the first three quarters of this match, Indian players impressed everyone by playing Total Hockey
 in khilaadiyon ne kuch maukey zarur ganvaaye
 One worry seems to be putting pressure on himself in the last moments that needs to be worked on, but if coach Rolant Oltmans' team continues to play like this, then the recurring breath of Indian hockey can get strength
