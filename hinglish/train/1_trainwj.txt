 Union Minister Smriti Irani will now make her parliamentary constituency her home
 unhone shanivaar ko is baat kii ghoshnaa kii
 This announcement by Union Minister Smriti Irani is such that what Congress President Rahul Gandhi could not do even in the last decade and a half
 irani ne ghoshnaa kii ki vah amethi main apana ghar banaaengi or iske liye unhone ek jameen kaa hissaa (bhukhand) gauriganj main dekh liya he
 Let us know that Union Minister Smriti Irani arrived here on a two-day visit to Amethi on Saturday
 loksabhaa chunaav main congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ko haraane ke baad irani kaa yah apane nirvachan kshetra kaa pehla daura he

 Smriti Irani is accompanied by Goa Chief Minister Pramod Sawant on the tour
 bijepi mantri smriti irani ne kaha ki amethi ab unka sthaayee nivas sthal hoga or vah logon ke liye uplabdh rahengi
 Let me tell you that she visited Amethi on Saturday

 Apart from this, she also met the people of Amethi

 Rahul Gandhi had represented Amethi in the Lok Sabha from 2004 to 2019 before the elections
 saal 1999 main unki maa sonia gandhi ne yah seat jiti thi
 Despite the continuous occupation of the Amethi seat, the Gandhi family did not think of building their own house here, instead they lived in a guest house during their visit
 apane nirvachan kshetra main ghar banane kaa smriti irani kaa faisla is baat kaa spasht sanket he ki vah aagaamee saalon main amethi ke saath sambandh barkaraar rakhane kaa iraadaa rakhti hai

 Union Railway and Energy Minister Piyush Goyal on Wednesday expressed surprise that if Congress President Rahul Gandhi is a citizen of Britain, then it is very strange because according to the constitution of the country, a citizen of another country cannot be an MP of India
 And that's why it is a fraud with the country
 kendriya mantri goyal ne ranchi ke nikat ramgarh main kendriya mantri jayant sinha ke liye ek chunavi sabha sambodhit karne ke baad samvaadadaata sammelan main yah baat kahi
 In response to a question, Goyal said, "A party which has been in power in the country for 55 years and most recently from 2004 to 2014
 uske adhyaksh rahul gandhi britani naagarik banakar britain main nivesh company banaate hai
 This leads to the wrong message because there is no provision of dual citizenship in India
 piyush goyal ne kaha ki itnaa hi nahin yadi vah britani naagarik hai to aakhir unhone iskaa khulaasa aaj tak kyon nahin kiya
 Why did he open his company in the UK by lying? ”goyal pulled up Gandhi in the case of deliberately using the Supreme Court's order and instructions to misinterpret it and use it for his own benefit, saying that finally the Congress President should be given his false The statements required an apology from the Supreme Court
 goyal ne ranchi se congress pratyaashee subodhakant sahay par bhi pradhanmantri narendra modi ke khilaaf abhadra bhashaa kaa upyog karne kaa aarope lagaaya or kaha ki chah may ko ranchi main hone vaale loksabhaa chunaavon main yahaan kii janata unhen sabak sikhayegi

 bhartiya loktantr 1977 ke baad se hi ek party ke prabhutv or kai partiyon ke maha gathjod ke bich jhulata aa rahaa he
 Earlier the Congress used to dominate, then since May 2014, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has reached this status
 vaise, rajyon main to gathbandhan kaa daur kaaphi pehle 1967 main hi aa gaya tha, jab congress 16 vidhansabha chunaavon main se aath main haar gai thi
 These seven states in the north and Tamil Nadu in the south used coalition governments and ideologically broad alliances
 ye tamaam gathbandhan bhale najuk, asthaayee or pareshaani vaale rahe hon, magar inamen matadaataaon kaa vyapak pratinidhitiv hua karata tha
 Then in 1977, Indira Gandhi's autocratic Emergency and JP movement culminated in a grand alliance as the Janata Party, which consisted of ideologically opposite Dhruva parties — from the Jana Sangh to the Left Front
 jaiprakash narayan congress virdohi vipaksh ke maseehaa ban gaye
 On the basis of this same experiment of 1977, Vishwanath Pratap Singh made a provocative experiment in 1989 to form an alliance against Rajiv Gandhi's government which included BJP and Left Front as allies

 By that time, the ambitions of regional parties and state satraps had become so high that it was almost impossible for the national parties to ignore them from the electoral perspective
 lihaaja, do pramukh rashtriya gathbandhanon kii neenv padi, jo bhartiya raajnneeti kii nai hakeekat ban gaeh congress ke netritv vaala sanyukt pragatisheel gathbandhan (upie) or bijepi ke netritv vaala rashtriya janatantric gathbandhan (endie)
 For the last two decades, regional parties have tied their allegiance and their electoral future to one of these
 haalanki pichley daur main is tarah ke gathbandhan najuk rahe or koi bhi sarkaar main kaarykaal puraa karne main kaamyaab nahin ho paaya
 But since 1998, the coalition that came to power at the Center remained stable and all served a five-year term
 2014 ke aam chunaavon main modi ke netritv main bijepi ko bahumat mila lekin usne phir bhi endie kii chhatari tale hi bane rahanaa pasand kiya or jin rajyon main vah satta main nahin thi, vahaan bhi usne endie ke naam se hi chunaav ladaa
 However, when it seemed that bjp's chariot was impossible to stop, Chatur Lalu Prasad Yadav and Nitish Kumar formed a grand alliance in Bihar and severely knocked the BJP in the 2015 Bihar assembly elections
 ab sawaal he ki 2019 main koun jitegaa? endie taqatvar bana rahegaa yaa phir bihar kii tarj par kisi mahagathbandhan se maat kha jayega? yakeenan, paanch rajyon—uttar pradesh, punjab, uttarakhand, goa or manipur main vidhansabha chunaavon ke nateezon se is bare main kuch sanket milegaa
 By the way, India today-karvy Insights reveals three trends in the country's mood opinion poll
 ek, narendra modi lokapriy bane hue hai or shaayad unhone notebandi ko garibon ke haq kii ladaai bataakar apane phaayde main tabdeel kar liya he
 Secondly, even though the challenge from Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi has weakened in the last one year, he still remains Modi's most important opponent
 tisare, ''anya" kii shrenee main bataae jane waalon kii chunauti badi he, jisamen kai rajnatik dal or kai mahatvapurn rajyon ke behtareen kaamkaaj vaale mukhyamantri hai
 Can all these together create a grand alliance of jp's style at the national level and present a tough challenge to the BJP in 2019? Says Janata Dal (united) MP Harivansh, "nitish and Lalu's grand alliance in Bihar views broad alliances Is an excellent example of the new form of donon hi jepi ke shishy rahe hai, jo mahagathbandhan kii raajnneeti ke janak maane jate hai
 "now the question is whether the Congress can be accepted as the main party in any such alliance at the national level, which has been the single largest party in the country for a long time
 is par harivansh yaad dilaate hai ki congress bihar main 2015 ke mahagathbandhan kaa bhi hissaa thi
 So can the Bihar formula be applied to form a grand alliance at the national level against the Modi-led NDA in 2019? Politics is a game of contingent possibilities with many surprises hidden
 harivansh kehete hai, ''aaj kii sthiti kii tulana 2004 se kiijie, jab sari partiyaan bikhri hui thim, dur-dur tak kisi gathjod kii sambhaavna najar nahin aati thi
 NDA looked invincible under Atal Bihari Vajpayee's charismatic leadership and his "shining India" campaign

 "who else? Who? The three digits — 42, 25 and 33 — represent the vote percentages of NDA, UPA and" others "respectively, and that is why the mood of the country's opinion poll
 philhal endie ko badhat he kyonki use agast 2016 keisi surveykshan se is baar do fisadi adhik ank mili hai
 The UPA is in a state of disrepair and its vote percentage has shown a one percent drop from the August 2016 survey
 lekin agar upie in ''anya" main se zyaadaatar dalon ke saath haath mila letaa he to ve milakar vot pratishat ko 58 fisadi tak le ja sakate hai
 Then the pan can tilt to the other side

 The largest section in this category is Samajwadi Party, Left Front, DMK, AIADMK, Bahujan Samaj Party, (BSP) Trinamool Congress, Kerala Congress and many other smaller parties
 congress ne farvari-march main hone vaale uttar pradesh vidhansabha chunaavon ke liye pehle hi sapa ke saath chunaav-purv gathbandhan banane main kamyaabi hasil kar lee he

 use 2016 main in donon hi chunaavon main maat to khaani padi lekin use haar trinmul or eiediemke ke haathon mili, na ki bijepi ke netritv vaale endie se
 In 2004, the UPA had 335 members in the Lok Sabha and had outside support from the BSP, SP, Kerala Congress and the Left Front, all of whom came under the category of "others" in our survey

 The best-performing three Chief Minister NDA leader Narendra Modi may be the most popular in the country, but among the 29 state chief ministers, the three most popular — Nitish in Bihar, Mamta in Bengal and Arvind Kejriwal in Delhi — are from non-nda parties
 survey main nitish ko deshbhar se 14 fisadi logon kaa samarthan mila, mamata ko 9 fisadi or kejariwal ko 7 fisadi
 Nitish's policy of prohibition has made him the favorite leader of common people across the country
 survey main gramin maton main 18 fisadi unke samarthan main the
 It is significant in view that there were 29 Chief Ministers in the competition
 in teenon mukhyamantriyon—nitish, mamata or kejariwal ne farvari 2016 ke baad se desh kaa mizaaj surveykshanon main sheersh teen sthaan hasil kiye hai
 However, Kejriwal's support has dropped from 14 per cent in August 2016 to seven per cent in 2017
 jab yah poocha gaya ki koun netaa tisare morche kaa netritv karne ke liye sabase upyukt he, to inhen teenon ko sabase zyada mat mili—kejariwal ko 11 fisadi, nitish ko 10 fisadi or mamata ko 8 fisadi
 Modi supporters may dismiss them as regional challenges compared to national leadership
 lekin hamen yah dhyaan rakhana hoga ki modi khud bhi ek kshetreey netaa hi the jo gujarat ke mukhyamantri ke pad se ubhare or antat kendriya manch par sthapit ho gaye
 Rahul's performance may have declined in popularity since the last survey, but when asked to assess his performance as Congress vice-president, 39 per cent rated him as good / best, compared to 33 who said so in August 2016
 Only a percentage were people
 modi ko 2019 main chunauti koun de saktaa he, is sawaal par bhi rahul ko sakaaratmat mat mili
 This time 28 per cent of the people chose him, while six months ago 23 per cent of the people favored him
 is maamle main unhen nitish, kejariwal or yahaan tak ki sonia gandhi se bhi zyada mat mili
 On the question of who can challenge the NDA in 2019, the Congress-led UPA also chose the people
 kul 31 fisadi logon ne tisare morche ke mukaable uskaa paksh liya
 Of course, the Modi-led NDA is powerful right now and the 2019 picture for the opposition is blurred
 lekin rahul ke netritv vaali congress agar akele chalane ke badale gathbandhan ko tarjeeh detii he to 2019 main bhi 2004 doharaaya ja saktaa he

 The role of this petition was framed by Kannada actress Jayamala's confession that she visited the temple in 1987 at the age of 28 after which the temple was purified
 bhakthi pasrija sethi yachika daakhil karne ke dauraan bhartiya yuva vakil association kii mahasachiv thim
 She says, "it was a shock to hear this incident
 ham sabake man main yahi vichaar aayaa ki jab ek purush ke pravesh se mandir ashuddh nahin hota, to mahila ke pravesh se kaise ashuddh ho saktaa he? hamane us ghatana par charchaa kii or mahasoos kiya ki yah mahilaon kii garima kaa hanan he, is tarah hamane yachika daayar karne kaa faisla kiya
 She is currently the Vice President of the Women's Lawyers Association in the Supreme Court
 unhone kaha, "bhakthi kii bhaavana ko stri-purush main bhedbhaav kar thes nahin pahunchaa sakate
 The ban on the entry of women inside the temple is a form of untouchability and a violation of Article 17
 ''vakil prerana bhi aisa hi maanati hai
 He has filed a separate petition
 ve kahati hai, "jab maine yachika daayar kii thi, us samay mujhe sabarimala mandir main prachlit parampara ke bare main zyada jaankaree nahin thi, na hi kerala kii mahilaon ke saath koi sampark tha
 For me, this incident was related to discrimination between men and women
 '' prerana ab supreme court main mahila vakil association kii secretary general hai
 She describes the Supreme Court's decision to allow women entry into the Sabarimala temple as historical
 ve kahati hai, "meri najar main mandir ke andar mahilaon ke pravesh par pratibandh lagaana unke sanvaidhanik adhikaar or anuchhed 14 or 15 kaa ulanghan he
 When the hearing first started in August 2006, 24 defendants were associated with it
 pasrija or prerana ko mahasoos hota he ki mahilaon ko mandir main pravesh kii ijaajat dene kaa mudda dharmik swatantraaa, stri-purush samanta or mahila swaittata se judaa he
 She also states that the purpose of the petition was not to undermine the autonomy of religion, or its structure
 pasrija kahati hai, "is par supreme court main vichaar-vimarsh kiya gaya tha
 "he also said," The temple cannot be defiled by entering a person
 yah andhvishwaas he
 This matter is related to the dignity of the person and the dignity of the person is very important

 Significantly, Sanjay Dutt was a drug addict in the early stages of his film career
 ve ek baar heroin kii hevidos lene ke baad do din baad jaage the or unke naukar sanjay ko dekhakar rone lage the
 Sanjay realized then that if he did nothing about his addiction, he would die
 isi ke baad sanjay ne apane pita se ediction ko lekar baat kii thi or unase madad maangi thi
 After getting treatment in the US, Sanjay made a great comeback in Bollywood

 All the wishes of Krishnapala were also worn with feathers, which he had made to make his 20-year-old daughter Rashmi's hands yellow
 udhar gehun kii shandaar fasal kheton main khadi thi or idhar shaadi kii taiyaariyaan shuru ho gayi
 But his aspirations were not fulfilled, because in the meantime government mismanagement came to the fore
 sarkari kray centre par gehun bechney kaa sila yah mila ki krishnapal beete do maah se zyada samay se bhugtan ke liye bhatak rahe hai
 "on June 12, i sold 42 quintals of wheat to the Bijrutha Means Cooperative Society and in return i got Rs 39,000," he says
 kaa check thamaya gaya
 When i put this check in the bank to encash it bounced
 ” iske baad se to krishnapal bhugtan ke liye dar-dar kii thokaren kha rahe hai or isaki vajah se unki bitiyaa kii shaadi tal gai he
 This time, 18 quintal wheat crop was produced in three bigha fields of farmer Ramesh Kushwaha of Bijrutha village
 is fasal ko bechney ke liye jab ve kharid centre pahunche to 50 kilo gehun avaidh kamishan main kaat liya gaya
 22,000 from the committee after selling wheat which was Rs
 kaa check mila, uskaa bhugtan abhi tak nahin ho paaya he
 Says Ramesh, "I pledged 600 grams of silver gourd to a bani of Talbehat for Rs

 saikadaa par kharif kii fasal bone ke liye paise udhaar liye hai
 If wheat money is not found, i will be ruined
 ”ye halaat bundelkhand ke un kisaanon ke hai, jinhone kai dinon tak lambii linon main khadey hokar bamushkil apana gehun is ummid ke saath bechaa tha ki bade hue samarthan mulya se unhen gehun kii badhibia keemat milegi or unki acchhee-aamadani ho jaaegi, lekin in kisaanon ko apni gehun kii fasal kaa daam milane kii bajaae dar-dar kii thokaren mil rahi hai
 As a result, the kharif crops sown during the rainy season also fell out of hand
 bundelkhand main un kisaanon ko bhugtan kii dikkaton kaa saamana karnaa padaa, jinhone gehun kii fasal sahakaarita samitiyon ko bechi thi
 In fact, two purchasing agencies 'uttar Pradesh Consumer Cooperative Union' and 'uttar Pradesh Cooperative Federation' have purchased wheat this time in the cooperative department
 sabhi sahakaari samitiyon ne inhen agenciyon ke kray agent ke rup main kaam kiya
 These committees bought wheat from farmers and sent it to FCI godowns for storage
 gehun kii delivery hone ke baad hi epasiai se in samitiyon ko dhan kaa aavanton hua
 An Additional Registrar of Cooperatives Department states that FCI godowns were immediately filled with wheat bags in many districts of Bundelkhand region due to excess wheat crop and not enough space in government warehouses for its storage
 aise main ve samitiyon ke kharide gaye gehun kaa bhandaaran nahin kar paae
 As a result, in the absence of delivery, the wheat of the societies was lying in their temporary warehouses and the money could not reach the purchasing agents' account
 udhar sahakaari samitiyon ne kisaanon ko khate main paisa na hone par bhi check jari kar die jo baad main bouns ho gaye
 If we take only seven districts of Bundelkhand, this time there was a record production of wheat in the rabi crop
 is kaaran in jilon main nirdhaarit lakshya se 17 pratishat adhik gehun kii kharid kii gai
 In the districts of Jalaun, Jhansi, Hamirpur and Mahoba including Lalitpur, lakhs of quintals of wheat have been stored in junior high schools, primary schools, panchayat buildings, mandi chabootars and rented godowns in the absence of warehouses
 is gehun kii delivery jab tak epasiai ke godaamon main nahin hogi, tab tak kisaanon ko iskaa bhugtan nahin ho paaegaa
 Due to the non-delivery of wheat in FCI godowns, farmers have about Rs 70 crore
 kaa bhugtan pechidagiyon main ulajh gaya he
 Farmers are circling the authorities every day to get the price of their crops, but no hearing is being held
 jab sabar kaa baand tuutane laga to lalitpur samet kai jilon main kisaanon ne pradarshan kaa sahaara bhi liya, lekin afasarshahi ke kaanon par jun tak nahin rengi
 Ramkishan Yadav, a farmer who came to protest at Talbehat in Lalitpur due to non-payment, says that hundreds of farmers have been killed for more than two months due to check bounce
 sarkaar ne jab gehun kharida tha to uskaa samarthan mulya 1,285 ru
 Per quintal whose market price has now increased to Rs 1,450
 prati quintal ho gaya he
 Ramkishan says, "if the government is unable to pay the farmers their wheat, it should order the cooperatives to return their crops
" ”lalitpur main saadhan sahakaari samiti ke sachiv seetaram bataate hai ki jile main ab tak 3,05,240
 44 quintals of wheat have been delivered and 1,63,538
 06 quintal gehun abhi bhi samitiyon kii nigaraanee main rakhaa hua he
 This wheat kept temporarily is deteriorating due to soaking in rain
 ab boron main se ankur bhi footne lage hai
 There are also complaints of its rottenness in many places
 jhaansi ke kai gaanvon ke bhi aise hi halaat hai
 83,000 MT of wheat was procured here, but so far only 62,000 MT of wheat has been delivered
 delivery na hone ke kaaran yahaan bhi kisaanon kaa paisa atka hua he
 Farmer leader Bhanu Sahai says, "large number of farmers are on the verge of starvation due to non-payment of crop
 or ve agali fasal bone kii sthiti main bhi nahin hai
 "it is not that there was no plan for storing bumper crops of farmers
 epasiai ne gehun kii banpar fasal ko rakhane ke liye varsh kii shuruyaat main hi nijee godaamon ko kiraye par lene kii yojana banaai thi, lekin iskaa kiraaya tay na hone ke kaaran yah yojana paravaan nahin chadh pai or banpar fasal paidaa karne ke baad bhi kisaanon ke haath dikkatein hi lageen
 An FCI official says that 6 every month

 Permanent rate per quintal and Rs 2

 There is no storage problem due to no decision on this

 Ravindra Singh Yadav, General Manager, Price Support, states that some problems related to the payment of checks were encountered in Hamirpur and some surrounding areas, which were promptly resolved
 yadav bataate hai, ''jin kisaanon ke check bouns hue the, unhen tatkaal doosraa check jari kar diya gaya tha
 “the problem is not just about the check bouncing due to lack of money in the account
 ek sahakaari bank main adhikari ram prasad bataate hai ki saadhan samitiyon ko gehun bechney vaale kisaanon ko is baat kii bhi jaankaree nahin di gai thi ki bank main check kaise lagaana he
 Ram Prasad says, "many farmers did not put the slip they got after selling wheat with a check
" iske chalate check main ankit dhanrashi kaa milan nahin ho paaya or yah bouns ho gaya
 Naseemuddin Siddiqui, senior BSP leader and Leader of Opposition in the Legislative Council, says, "the problems of the farmers of Bundelkhand have increased with the formation of the SP government
 chekon kaa bhugtan na hone ke baavjood sarkaar ne iske liye doshi adhikariyon par karrwai karnaa to dur, unase jawaab talab tak nahin kiya he
 “however, the expectations of the farmers have reverberated
 paisa na hone ke kaaran na sirf unki jaruratein puri nahin ho rahi hai, balki khet bhi khaali or viraan pade hai

 ab upi kii sattarudh samaajawaadee party ne oropi ke masale ko lekar modi sarkaar par hallaa bol diya he
 Amid public outcry after the Uri attack, Indian commandos entered Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and destroyed the hideouts of the terrorists, then the Modi government prepared to capitalize on the army's action in the upcoming assembly elections
 modi sarkaar ke liye upi ke vidhansabha behad ahm hai
 After the surgical strike, the BJP, which was preparing for the UP election, put up posters related to it
 in postaron par piem modi or raksha mantri manohar parrikar kii tasviren pramukhataa se lageen
 When PM Modi went to Lucknow on the occasion of Dussehra, he also tried to woo voters by raising the issue of surgical strikes
 aisa lagane laga ki bijepi is maukey kaa puraa phayda uthaa legi
 But the opposition parties have now found a new weapon against the Modi government
 vaise shuru main to vipaksh nesargical strikke astitv par hi sawaal khadey kar die or oparation ke saboot mangakar modi sarkaar ko baikfoot par laane kii koshish kii
 Somehow the matter was calm, a theory was taken out that the army had already carried out the surgical strike while the Modi government kept claiming that it had never happened before
 modi sarkaar par palatwaar karne waalon main aam aadmi party or congress sabase aage rahe
 Opposition parties also criticized the Modi government over the fact that the government is taking credit for the work of the army which is not right

 The Kejriwal government of Delhi has even announced a compensation of one crore rupees to the kin of the deceased and a government job to a member
 guuruuvaar ko hi upi ke siem akhilesh yadav kismajawaadee vikaas rath yatraaka aagaaj hua
 On this occasion, Akhilesh Yadav and SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav attacked the Modi government

 There was a lot of drama at Asaram's Indore ashram when the Jodhpur Police squad led by ACP Chanchal Mishra came here along with Indore police under the command of DIG Rakesh Gupta
 donon police daston ke saamne duvidha yah thi ki unhen aaropee ko bhaagane nahin dena tha or kanoon ke mutabik usase poochtacha kerani thi
 Also, it was to be seen that the devotees should not suffer any harm
 diiji gupta ne bataaya, ham khaas taur par baba ramdev ke saath ramlila maidan main hui ghatana ko doharaana nahin chaahate the
 Our complete focus was that no devotee should have a single stick
 dur-dur se aae 4,000 se adhik bhakton ne ashram ko jane vaali sadakon par hari chataaiyaan failaa deen
 Now the police could neither pass over them with Asaram nor take the jeep inside the ashram
 police ne bhi teen din tak google ke nakshon se ashram kaa chappa-chappa chaanaa tha
 He saw that there is a road on which only the servants come
 vahaan saadi vardi main police vaale tainaat kar die gaye or baaki sadakon par vardi main police vaale khadey rahe
 Around 11 o'clock in the night, the servants sensed the tricks of the police and they started laying mats on the third road as well
 apni chaal naakaam hote dekh indore police ne jodhpur police se kaha ki jhatpat or sakhti se kaam nibataae
 Asaram sometimes threatened suicide, sometimes locked himself in a room and then disappeared for dinner
 jaankaar sutron kaa kahana he ki vah is ummid main taal matol kar rahaa tha ki shikaayat karne vaali ladki ke pita ko kharidne main kaamyaab ho jayega
 Asaram could not believe that his political devotees would betray him
 lekin sutron kaa kahana he ki uske talkh bhaashanon kaa ulataa asar hua
 One reason for the collapse of the fort of Indore was also that the media was lagging behind day and night
 jab asaram ko pataa lag gaya ki narendra modi ne saath chhod diya he to usne bhopal se ahmedabad kii udaan chhod di
 When he felt that the doors of the political corridor in New Delhi had been closed, he fled to Indore in the hope that a large number of supporters would call and take some time out
 police sutron kaa kahana he ki jodhpur kii asipi chanchal ne apane majboot iraade ke bal par hi yah maamla suljhaayaa, jab asaram ne khud ko kamare main band kar liya to unhone darwaja todane kii dhamkee di
 The ACP was determined that whatever happens, Asaram will be arrested and the trial will be carried out
 aakhirkaar kisi bhi najar se dekhen, uske patan kaa kaaran ek damdaar mahila afasar hi bani
 It is too late to close the doors to the Indore ashram

 According to official sources, the Home Ministry has given the Delhi government two other options for the top administrative post
 pehle vikalp ke rup main grih mantralay ne teen varisht iees adhikariyon ke naam dilli sarkaar ko bheje hai, jinamein se kisi ek kaa chayan kiya ja saktaa he
 Negi's name is not in this list
 duusare vikalp ke anusaar grih mantralay ne dilli sarkaar se 80,000 rupee ke vetanman vaale kisi adhikari kaa naam sujhane ko kaha he
 According to sources, the Delhi government may accept the second option and recommend the name of an officer who is in the top pay scale for the new Chief Secretary
 negi kii niyukti ke raste main do mukhya adchane hai
 The first one is about a dozen officers senior to Negi, who are working in different positions and the second that Negi does not come in the pay scale of 80,000

 There was chaos in the Western Zone office of Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation today when activists of the Lok Sabha Committee shouted at them
 bhashtrachaar kaa aarope lagaate hue in kaaryakartaaon ne korporation ke adhikariyon ke munh main achaar ore tomato kechap ke saath-saath 10, 20, 50, 100 or 500 rupee ke note unke munh main thuns die
 Soon after the news of the uproar, police from Vastrapur area of the city reached here and arrested many activists, including the chairman of the Lok Rakshak Samiti
 un par aarope he ki unhone adhikariyon ke saath durvyavhaar kiya
 Forcibly inserted pickles and tomato ketchup notes into the officers' mouths
 jis main kuch mahilaayein bhi shaamil thim
 The Public Guard Committee says that they have waged a campaign against corruption
 samiti ke kaaryakartaaon kaa aarope he ki adhikari dharmendra vyas property tex kii penalty kaa setlement karne ke liye rishwat maang rahaa tha
 To teach him a lesson, the workers of the committee not only dealt strictly with the officials but also fed them notes
 srilanka 14 farvari se shuru ho rahe isisi vishwa cap 2015 main agar prabal daavedaar nahin he to anya timen use halke main bhi nahin le raheen
 Sri Lankan captain Angelo Mathews also made a statement a few days ago that he is happy that his team is not being considered a strong contender
 maithyuj ke anusaar, iskaa sabase bada phayda yah he ki team par kisi prakaar kaa koi dabaav nahin he
 The biggest feature and perhaps the weakest side of the Sri Lankan team selected for the World Cup is that the team consists of many experienced players and former captains
 yah paristhiti team ke liye ek dodhari talwaar jaisi he
 Mathews, however, brushed aside any such concerns, saying that players like Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene are the inspiration for the entire team
 yah bhi gaur karne vaali baat he ki srilanka pichley donon sanskarnon ke final main pahunchaa tha
 Also, Sri Lanka have managed to reach the semi-finals in five editions of the last six worlds
 aise main saaf he ki 1996 kii vishwa champion team srilanka ko is baar bhi toornament main kam kar ke nahin aanka ja saktaa
 It is definitely that the team is not seen in its magnificent rhythm this time
 pichley hi maheene newjiland ke khilaaf saat maichon kii shrunkhlaa main 2-4 se mili haar ne prashansakon kii chintaa or badhaai he
 The biggest bowler in bowling will be Lasith Malinga, who is returning after a long time
 malinga takhne main lagi chot ke kaaran team se baahar chal rahe the
 Mathews has also admitted that a lot will depend on Malinga's performance, but at the same time he also denied that the team's bowling is completely dependent on Maliga
 thisara perera, nuwan kulasekara or maithyuj ke kandhon par bhi team kii gendbaaji kii kaman hogi

 Sri Lanka last won the World Cup in 1996
 yah jayavardhane or sangakaara jaise senior khilaadiyon kaa aakhri vishwa cap he
 In such a situation, the young faces of the team will definitely try to win the World Cup with the purpose of giving them a good farewell and this thinking will probably also serve as an inspiration for the team this time

 He said, 'nitish Kumar developed the aspiration to become PM
 iske baad hi BJP or JDU kaa gathbandhan tutaa
 He raised the question that how can Nitish finally join hands with the Congress, while his entire politics is based on the opposition of the Congress
 nand kishor yadav ne kaha, 'nitish ne maanjhi ko isliye pad se hataaya, kyonki ve unke vot bank ke liye khatra ban gaye the
 Nand Kishore Yadav alleged that Nitish insulted Manjhi for removing him
 unhone kaha, 'nitish ne apane pravaktaaon se kaha tha ki ve maanjhi ke khilaaf apmanjanak bayaan den

 Even if the rebel mlas of the Majhi faction stand in opposition during the trust vote, the majority figure still appears to be in favor of the government

 - Membership of eight rebel mlas is over
 --1 sadsy kii maut ho chuki he

 - RJD has 24 members
 --congress ke paas 5 kaa aankada
 CPI has 1 MLA and 2 Independent Members

 In this case, the figure is completely with Nitish

 In such a situation, it will have to be seen whether the BJP does a walkout or demands a division of votes
 china ke saath doklam vivaad par bharat ke kootnithik prayaason kaa rang dikhnaa shuru ho gaya he
 China seems to be surrounded by the international fraternity on this issue
 america ke baad japan ne bhi doklam vivaad par bharat kaa samarthan kiya he
 Japan has said that the dispute between the two countries should be resolved through dialogue
 do mahashaktiyon ke samarthan antarrashtriya str par bharat ke paksh main ban rahe maahaul ke bich china bhadak uthaa he
 Let us know that in the second week of July, the forces of India, America and Japan did the Malabar maneuvers in the Bay of Bengal
 bharat or china ke bich kareeb pichley do maheenon se doklam main china kii ore se sadak nirmaan ko lekar vivaad chal rahaa he
 The forces of the two countries are standing face to face on Doklam, bordering india-bhutan-china
 duusari ore china lagaataar bharat par apni sena ko peeche bulaane kaa dabaav bana rahaa he, jabaki bharat peeche hatane ko taiyaar nahin he
 In view of India's stand, China's state media is constantly threatening war
 ab sabase bada sawaal ye he ki agar aaj kii sthiti main bharat or china ke bich yuddh hota he to duniya kii mahashaktiyaan kiskaa saath dengi
 Let's understand
 bharat ke saath koun-koun se desh?america -america maujuuda samay main bharat kaa sabase taqatvar dost he
 The United States is constantly monitoring the Doklam case
 US kii ore se bayaan bhi aa chukaa he ki bharat hamaara acha dost he, china or bharat ko is mudde ko baatcheet se suljhaana chahie
 Earlier, former US Ambassador Richard Verma and US Illinois Member of Parliament Raja Krishnamurthy had blamed China for the Doklam dispute
 aapako bataa den ki donald trump kaa rukh china ko lekar kadaa rahaa he, kyonki america kii naak main dam karne vaale north korea ke liye china hameshaa hi naram rukh apanaataa rahaa he
 The impact of the friendship of japan-prime Minister Narendra Modi and Japanese PM Shinzo Abe has also been shown here
 japan ne khule taur par bharat kaa saath diya he
 Japanese Ambassador Kenji Hiramatsu said in a conversation with Aaj Tak, "the escalation of Doklam has been going on for the last two months
 hamaara maananaa he ki isse puure kshetra kii sthirataa prabhavit ho saktaa he, aise main ham is par kareebi najar banaae hue hai
 With this, he said, there is a dispute between China and Bhutan about this region
 jahaan tak bharat kii bhoomika kii baat he, to ham maanate hai ki vah bhutan ke saath apane dwipaksheeya samjhaute ke aadhaar par hi is maamle main dakhal de rahaa he
 Australia - Australia's Foreign Minister Julie Bishop recently visited India
 unhone yahaan par saaf taur par kaha tha ki china ko doklam vivaad par sanyam baratna chahie, or bharat se baat kerani chahie
 Apart from this, Australia has also issued a warning regarding China's Dadagiri over the South China Sea
 is mudde par australia ne china kii sainya mahatvakanshaaon kaa virodh kiya tha
 Vietnam - PM Modi visited Vietnam in 2016, since then the relations between the two countries have strengthened
 dakshini china sagar main vivaad ko lekar vietnam kii china se hameshaa hi thani rahi he, iske alaava bharat ne uski lagaataar madad kii he
 India is also considering giving Akash missile to Vietnam, while Sukhoi will also train 30 MKI fighter jets
 europea desh bhi aa sakate hai saath -europe ke kuch taqatvar desh jaise france, germany or britain bhi china ke mudde par bharat ke saath aa sakate hai
 India's relations with all these countries have been very good, while these countries have supported India on many issues
 sayukt raashtra suraksha parishad main in sabhi deshon ne bharat kaa sthai seat ke liye saath diya he, vahiin china bharat ke khilaaf rahaa he
 Which countries with China? Pakistan - Friendship between China and Pakistan has been flourishing for some time
 van belt van road ke jariye china pakistan main kaaphi badi maatra main nivesh kar rahaa he
 China has resorted to its veto to protect many terrorists from being declared international terrorists
 is sabase saaf he ki pakistan har morche par china ke saath hi jayega
 The relations between India and Pakistan have not been good anyway, recently China threatened to interfere in the Kashmir issue
 north korea -pichley kaaphi samay se puri duniya kii naak main dam karne vaala north korea china kaa kareebi he
 On the one hand, when America has been continuously warning North Korea, China had asked the US to take peace on this issue
 china ne lagaataar north korea ko lekar naram rukh apanaaya he
 Which side will Russia sit on? Which side Russia is considered to be a close friend of India, it is not clear yet
 doklam ke vivaad par abhi rus kii ore se koi bada bayaan nahin aayaa he

 On Tuesday, the Indian Air Force did the work that Pakistan would never have imagined
 khaybar pakhtoonkhwaa ke balakot main bhartiya vayusena ke vimaan ghuse or takreeban 300 dehshatgardon ko dher kar kiya
 These terrorists who were zamindos were those who had the intention of shaking Hindustan
 is hamale kii bhale hi chautarafa tarif kii ja rahi ho lekin yah yaad rakhana hoga ki pakistan ab bhi un darindon ko paal rahaa he jo bharat main aatanki narsanhaar ke doshi hai
 Two of these names are important - Maulana Masood Azhar and Hafiz Saeed
 bhartiya suraksha agenciyon or sena ke radar par in donon kii shinaakht kab kii ho chuki he lekin afsos ki khud ko ek islamic loktantr kehane vaala pakistan aatankiyon kii rahanumai main laga he
 Yes, Azhar and Saeed have survived till now, so the politics and the rulers there are responsible for it
 balakot main hindustan ke hamale ke baad pakistani netaa or purv pradhanmantri navaj sharif ke bhai shahbaaj sharif kaa ek gaur karne laayak bayaan aayaa
 He said that we will hoist our flag in New Delhi
 jhanda fahre ye to vakt hi batayega lekin is shahbaaj sharif ko bhaleebhanti jaan lenaa chahie ki pakistan main agar masood ajahar, hafiz said chutta gum rahe hai, to iske peeche shahbaaj sharif kaa hi haath he
 If we look at the statements of former Punjab Governor Salman Taseer, you will understand what the whole politics of Punjab province has been doing to save Azhar
 vikiliks ke ek khulaase main salmaan taasir yah kehete sune gaye ki sabakuch dekhne sunne ke baad bhi punjab sarkaar jaish sargana masood ajahar or lashkar-e-taiyaba (purv main naam) ke pramukh hafiz said ke khilaaf karrwai karne main naakaam rahi he
 Since 1994, why Azharpakistan has been protecting them, and even if we do not go into the details of what its economic and strategic intent is, it is certain that Indian agencies have been following Azhar since 1994 but that time escapes
 agar thodaa or peeche jaaen to maamla 1994 kaa he
 Azhar was arrested in Anantnag in February 1994
 ajahar tab portugali passport par bangladesh ke raste bharat main daakhil hua tha
 He was accompanied by another terrorist Sajjad Afghani
 sena ko afgani ke bare main jaankaree to thi lekin ajahar tab tak utana kukhyat nahin tha
 The military personnel therefore ran both to target the Afghani
 afgani ke saath ajahar bhi pakadaa gaya
 Unfortunately Azhar had to leave to save a foreign national in Delhi
 iske baad vah phir pakadaa gaya
 Everyone remembers that incident in 1999 when he was released in a Kandahar aircraft hijack
 uske baad bhartiya sansad par hamalaa, pathankot or uri kii ghatnaayen hamaare saamne hai jiske peeche ajahar kaa haath he
 Let the terrorists hiding in the army hospital tell you that the bloody history of 2019 on which the Pulwama attack took place in India and the search of Azhar which is going on day and night, started in the year 2000 in Badamibagh Cantt area of srinagar
azhar's first suicide attack in kashmir main ajahar kaa vah pehla fidaayin hamalaa tha jo army ke 15wein kor ko nishaanaa bana kar kiya gaya tha
 Two Indian soldiers were killed in that attack
 tab se lekar kashmir ke alag-alag ilaakon main uski dehshatgardi jari he or bharat jab bhi use maarane kii koshish karata he, pakistan use agosh main daal letaa he
 Something similar has happened this time too
 media reporton ke mutabik philhal vah kisi sena ke aspataal main chupa he jahaan tak bharat kii pahunch nahin ban paa rahi he
 Now let's talk about jamaat-ud-dawa (JUD) chief Hafiz Saeed
 2008 mumbai hamale ke vakt se bharat use khoj rahaa he
 Not only in India, it is well-known throughout South Asia
 tabhi america ne iske maathe par 10 lakh dollar kaa inaam ghoshit kar rakhaa he
 166 people were killed in the Mumbai attack, including some foreign nationals
 america ke dabaav ke baavjood pakistan said ke khilaaf bahut badi karrwai nahin kar paata, sivaay use do baar najarband karne ke
 Now the question is that if Pakistan is not able to take complete action on the terrorist on which the US has killed the Red Cross, then it is easy to know the reason
 aatankiyon ko paalati he paak sentzhar ho yaa said, in par karrwai kii jab baat hoti he to vahaan kii sarkarein isamen aage to aati hai lekin ection maamuli hote hai kyonki bich main vahaan kii sena aade aa jaati he
 It is the army that has kept many terrorists
 bharat ho yaa afghanistan, yaa phir rus ke chechenya tak, pakaparast aatankiyon ke taar dehshatgardi se judate aae hai
 Remember the 2014 Peshawar incident
 ek skool main talibani aatankiyon ne hamale kiye jisamen 166 log maare gaye, inamen zyaadaatar begunaah bachche shaamil the
 The then Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif then announced that strict action would be taken in future without differentiating between 'good and bad' terrorists
 sharif kaa achche talibani se matlab un aatankiyon se tha jo sena kii madad karte aae the
 On the other hand, Sharif talked about taking action against the terrorists and here two days later the Supreme Court ordered the release of Lashkar terrorist Zakiur Rahman Lakhvi
 lakhvi kaa naam bhi mumbai hamale main uchhla tha
 If Lakhvi is untouched, it is because the government of Pakistan kept the investigation against him so slow that the court had to order his release in the absence of evidence
 baat yaheen tak nahin he
 Lakhvi and Saeed missed out but they got help from the Pak government
 agar aisa nahin hota to said lashkar par bain lagane ke baad jamaat-ud-daawa kaise khadaa karata
 Not only that, how did he form his own party to fight in the last parliamentary election
 lakh take kaa sawaal yah bhi he ki america pratibandh ke baavjood aaj bhi use lahore main khuleam ghoomane kii ijaajat kaise mili?

 Former District Congress president of Meerut, Vinay Pradhan, who had allegedly called Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi as 'pappu' in a whatsapp group message, announced that he would soon launch a campaign to make the country 'pappu-free'
 yah abhiyaan kamobesh bijepi ke 'congress mukt bharat' se miltaa-julata he
 Earlier in a press conference on Wednesday, he said that it is because of Rahul Gandhi and some of his 'sycophants' that some people are dreaming of Congress-free India in the country
 apane istife kii ghoshnaa ke saath hi unhone kaha, ''jo shaks apni prashansa ko nahin samaj saktaa to vah vastav main 'pappu' hi he or mujhe unako aisa kehane kaa koi pachhtaawaa nahin he
 '' Comments congress se 22 saal jude rahane kaa daawa karne vaale vinay pradhan ne yah nahin bataaya ki unka aglaa siyaasi kadam kya hoga? kya vah bijepi yaa kisi anya dal main jaaenge? apane makasad main aakhir vah kaise kaamyaab honge? lekin unhone yah kaha ki unke 'pappu mukt' bharat ke sapane ko saakaar karne main kai congressi unki madad ko taiyaar hai
 It is worth mentioning that Vinay Pradhan had allegedly called Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi ‘pappu’ on whatsapp group a few days ago
 is prakaran ke baad pradhan ko meerut congress adhyaksh samet anya padon se hataa diya gaya
 Vinay Pradhan, who claimed to be associated with the Congress for 22 years, did not say what his next political move would be
 Will he go to BJP or any other party? How will he succeed in his cause? But he said that many Congressmen are ready to help him in realizing his dream of 'pappu Mukta' India
 ullekhneey he ki vinay pradhan ne kuch din pehle whatsap group par kathith rup se congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ko 'pappu' kah diya tha
 After this episode, Pradhan was removed from the post including Meerut Congress President

 The lack of absence of former captain and wicketkeeper batsman Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who is called the defender of Team India, is seen in the team
 dhoni ke vikalp yaa kahen dhoni ke uttaradhikari kahe jane vaale dilli ke wicketiper ballebaaj rishabh pant ke kharaab pradarshan ke baad ab shaayad team ko dhoni kii kami mahasoos ho rahi hogi
 After Pant's poor performance against South Africa, now many veteran players have questioned it, many also came to the rescue
 to vahiin lage haath soshal media par bhi logon main pant ke khilaaf gussa dikhaa he
 Prior to the T20 series played against South Africa, Pant did not have any special performance on the tour of West Indies
 isaki aalochana khud team ke head coach ravi shastri kar chuke hai
 Pant had scored just 69 runs in three T20 matches against the West Indies
 dakshin africa ke khilaaf bhi pant ne teen tii-20 maichon main sirf 23 ran hi banaae
 However, the first match was canceled due to rain
 kul milakar rishabh is vakt kaaphi kharaab form se guzar rahe hai
 Pant has played only half-century in the last 20 matches
 pant is vakt chaar number par ballebaaji kar rahe hai
 Pant has been able to touch the figure of ten only eight times out of 19 innings, while eleven times Pant has not been able to touch the figure of ten
 pant ke ballebaaji kram par bhi kai diggaj khilaadiyon ne sawaal uthaate hue apni raay rakhi
 Former captain Sunil Gavaskar has also spoken on this
 gavaskar ne ek angreji akhbaar mid-de se kaha ki rishabh ko chaar number kii jagah paanch number par ballebaaji karwaani chahie jisase ki vah apana natural game khel sake
 However, despite repeated chances for Pant, due to his poor performance, the team must have felt the lack of Dhoni somewhere
 dhoni kaa vikalp kahe jane vaale pant ab team kaa sahaara nahin banate dikh rahe hai, balki vah ab boj banate najar aa rahe hai
 What can happen outside the team? Pant, who is constantly in poor form, is now facing the problem of being out of Team India
 team ke captain viraat kohli pehle hi kah chuke hai ki ve kisi bhi khilaadi ko zyada maukey nahin denge
 Virat has made it clear that any player will be given a chance in 4-5 matches
 to vahiin team ke mukhya chayankarta em
 s
 ke
 Prasad has also said that he is eyeing Sanju Samson, Ishan Kishan and the rest of the wicketkeepers in place of Pant
 sanju samson or ishan kishan, in donon hi khilaadiyon ne ipiel main acha pradarshan kiya he
 In such a situation, the selectors can bet on these two players with confidence
 in sab ke chalate kayaas lagaae ja rahe hai ki pant par team se baahar hone kaa sankat mandara rahaa he
 Who is not even Dhoni then? According to the news, Dhoni has now decided to distance himself from the team
 media kii khabaron ke mutabik dhoni november tak team se dur rahenge
 He will also stay away from Bangladesh and Vijay Hazare Trophy
 to phir pant kii jagah koun aa saktaa he?agle saal hone vaale tii-20 vishwa cap ko dekhte hue captain viraat or team ke chayankarta duusare khilaadiyon ko aajamaa sakate hai
 By the way, the Test series is still pending from South Africa and Pant's name is also included in the list of 15 players
 to kul milakar ab dekhnaa yah hoga ki dakshin africa se test siries main rishabh pant ko mauka miltaa he yaa nahin
 However, it is being speculated that Wriddhiman Saha may get a place in the playing XI instead of Pant

 During the Zero Hour, Independent MLA from Samalkha region Ravinder Machharauli had raised questions about such pension during Zero Hour
 macharauli kaa kahana tha ki patni ke dehanth ke baad vidhuron ko apane bacchon kaa paalan-poshan karne main dikkat hoti he, isliye haryana sarkaar ko vidhuron ke liye bhi pension yojana shuru kerani chahie
 He had said that the Chief Minister is a Bachelor himself and he can understand the problem of a widower

 But an investigation by India Today has revealed that some of Kerala's mothers are engaged in teaching ideology
 ye saudi pryojit kattarpanthi gut hai, jise vishwa bhar main faile aatankwaad se judaa mana jaataa he
 These madrasas, who have received money through hawala funding from Gulf countries with a glut of petro dollars, are poisoning fundamentalism among the easily affected youth

 Mohammad Bashir, the joint secretary of the madrasa run by the Karuna Charitable Trust in Pullorammal in Kozhikode district, confessed, "if we talk about caliphate in public, there will be a problem
" aasapaas kai hindu log hai
 If we talk about the caliphate, Hindus will start calling us ISIS people
 isliye ham sidhe nahin kehete
 We are putting this little by little in the hearts of children

 Here we show Zakir Naik in video clips inviting women and other religious groups to adopt Islam
 phir unhen islam ko apanaate hue bhi dikhaaya jaataa he
 The India Today investigation also revealed that most such madrasas get funding from unknown people located in Gulf countries
 bashir or malik, donon ne hi kabool kiya ki unhen aarthik madad arab duniya se bhumigat hawala channelon ke jariye milti he
 Bashir said, 'it is difficult to do this through banks
 ye hundi (hawala) ke jariye hota he
 After being given his fictional identity as financiers from the Middle East by India Today's Under Cover Reporters, Bashir was convinced that funding could be obtained from here
 bashir ne 50 lakh rupye kii maang kii
 Bashir also assured that the money will be acquired through the hawala network without any hassle

 At the same time, Malik cited the worldwide alliances between hawala operators and radical madrassas like himself
 malik ne kaha, ‘videsh main bahut saare hamaare bhai alag alag deshon main hai
 Black money means bill for us
 hundi kaa matlab he ki aap vahaan paisa dete hai to kuch agenciyaan paise ko sidhe hamen yahaan de denge

 modi ne kaha ki bijepi ke netritv vaali kendra kii endie sarkaar ne pichley 5 saal ke dauraan vyapaariyon kii jindagi or kaarobaar ko saral banane ke liye kaaphi kaam kiya
 Addressing the traders, Prime Minister Modi said that the work of our Government was done to eliminate the old law of 1,500, simplified procedures and provided easy loans
 unhone kaha ki vyapaaree bhartiya arthvyavastha kii ridh hai lekin pehle unhen vah sammaan nahin mila jiske ve hakdaar the
 Some people arrive at a crematorium in Delhi carrying a bier
 vahaan baqayada pandit se milte hai or antim sanskaar se pehle kii shuruaati sari rasmon ko puri karte hai
 Now it was just the turn to put the bier on the pyre, but it could not happen
 kyonki usase pehle hi arthi ke saath aae tamaam log behad hi rahasyamayi tareeke se arthi ko shmashaan main hi chhodkar gaayab ho jate hai
 The incident is in the country's capital, Delhi
 kuch log yahaan ke nigambodh shmashaan ghat main moksh dwaar se ek arthi ko andar le aae
 According to rituals, the bier was placed on the platform before the funeral
 ab murde kii aatma ko shanti milane main zyada vakt nahin tha, moksh kaa vakt aa chukaa tha
 It was just late to put the bier on the funeral pyre
 magar do ghante biit gaye, arthi chabutare par hi thi
 The most surprising thing is that in these two hours, there was no one around the bier
 jo log arthi ko chabutare tak lekar aae the, wo sabhi haroonges taur par gaayab ho chuke the
 Time passed, but no one came to the economist lying on the platform
 is bich bahut se logon kii najar us arthi par padi or unhen bhi ye manjar ajeeb laga
 How can anyone run away before bringing salvation to someone despite having brought his or her meaning to the crematorium? Pandit Pramod Sharma of the crematorium also kept looking at the Lavaris lying on the platform for a long time
 aasapaas unhen bhi marane vaale kaa koi rishtedaar najar nahin aayaa
 Nigambodh Ghat receives 50 to 60 Arthas daily, so Panditji too got busy with his work
 magar phir fursat milte hi jab unhone dekha ki arthi ab bhi vaise hi padi he to unhen kuch shaq hua
 When he saw the bier from near, he realized that the corpse belonged to a woman
 iske baad turant kashmiri get thane ko laavaaris arthi kii khabar di gai
 On receiving the news, SHO Bijender Singh Lady of the police station immediately reached Nigambodh Ghat with the police staff
 laash ab bhi chabutare par usee tarah padi thi
 After removing the shroud, it was found that the corpse was in sixteen adornments
 police ne shmashaan ke paditon se baat kii to pataa chalaa ki jis chabutare par arthi rakhi he, shivamurti ghadaaband ke isi chabutare par pindadaan ke baad matake kii rasm nibhaai jaati he
 Then after taking bath in the Sangam lake, the corpse is taken to the pyre
 police ne ab jaanch shuru kii to pataa chalaa ki arthi ke paas se mataka bhi gaayab he
 But the havan material was lying there in the bag near the economist
 iske baad jab police ne laash kaa muyna kiya to marane vaali ke daaen haath par use ek tatu guda najar aayaa
 SK was written in English on the hand
 jabaki baayen haath kii ek ungali main marane vaali ne jo anguthi pahan rakhi thi us par khushboo likhaa tha
 So was Khushi the name of the one who died? And what does SK mean? Complicated in these questions, the police also saw some marks of injury on the body of the person who died during the investigation
 police ke kaan fouran khadey ho gaye, lihaaja ab police ne or baariki se tafteesh shuru kar di
 But despite all the efforts, he could not find any Suraga, so that the name, address of the person who brought him to the crematorium could be known
 police ne laash ko apane kabje main lekar use murda ghar bhejne kaa faisla kiya
 So that the funeral cannot take place till the investigation is complete
 magar arthi se laash uthaate hi achaanak police kii najar us arthi par padi
 Don't know why but the police found it strange
 uski banaavat to ajeeb thi hi saath hi jis bans se arthi banaai gai thi wo bans bhi ajeeb tha, haraa-haraa
 Do not know why but the police were suspicious of seeing the bier and its bamboo, that the bier is made in a hurry and it may not be built around Nigambodh Ghat
 lihaaja police ne arthi banane waalon se apni jaanch shuru kii
 The police efforts were failing one after the other
 ab ye saaf ho gaya tha ki arthi nigambodh ghat ke aasapaas nahin bani, to phir kahaan bani? isi sawaal kaa jawaab jaanane ke liye police ne ek baar phir arthi ko khangaalane kaa faisla kiya
 The police still had no clue
 yahaan tak ki police ne gumshuda auraton ke bare main bhi pataa kiya to pataa chalaa ki dilli main is dauraan kisi ne kisi mahila kii gumshudagi kii report nahin likhaai he
 Along with the investigation of Lhaza Arthi, the police once again reached the crematorium
 is baar pandit se poochtacha main police ko ek nai baat pataa chali, arthi laane vaale ne pandit se kaha tha ki wo prem nagar se aayaa he
 Which Prem Nagar in Delhi now? And where in Prem Nagar? The police was not taking the name of the problem
 ab police kii kai timen prem nagar kii khoj main aman vihaar, shahbaad dairy or nagloi kii khaak chaanane lageen
 But no story of a woman or economist named Khushboo was found here
 tabhi police ko ek chaunkaane vaali baat yaad aayi or wo ye ki nigambodh ghat ke chabutare par jab arthi mili thi to vahaan baaki sab kuch tha sivaae pindadaan ke ghade ke
 In fact, according to the funeral on the platform on which the mortar was found inside the crematorium, the pitcher pot should also be there
 magar gadaa gaayab tha
 So when the police got the attention of the cremation pundits about this, then it is very possible that the economist was taken to another crematorium before bringing Nigambodh? So now the police started rinsing the rest of the crematoriums and soon found great success
 pataa chalaa ki arthi nagambodh ghat laane se pehle kiraadi ghat le jaai gai thi
 During interrogation at Kiradi Ghat, a boy was also found who was the witness of the whole case
 usne police ko bataaya ki arthi prem nagar se ai thi or wo antim yatra main kuch der ke liye shaamil bhi hua tha
 In the love town of Nagloi, finally the one who got the bier was also found
 wo arthi vaala nagloi kaa rahane vaala tha
 Then what was the meaning of the bier, when the clue was found, the address of the house was also found from where the bier emerged
 par jab police vahaan pahunchi to daravaaje par taala lataka tha, phir police ne bijli meter ke number se makaan maalik kaa pataa lagaaya
 The landlord inquired that he had sold this house to a person named Raju Shankar
 tafteesh main pataa chalaa ki raju shankar kaa ek jija he satyanarayan, jo samaypur badali main kisi biscuit factory main kaam karata he
 The name of Satyanarayan's wife is Khushboo
 police ko laash ke haath par mili tatu esake kaa matlab ab samaj aa gaya
 s means Satyanarayana and k means fragrance
 satya narayan or khushboo ne prem vivaah kiya tha, donon kaa ek saal kaa betaa bhi he
 a police team has been sent to Khushboo, a resident of Ara, Bihar
 satyanarayan or raju shankar donon faraar hai
 Now obviously the truth of the puzzle of escaping from the economist will not be revealed until Khushboo's family or both are absconding
 par jab ek arthi se police arthi ke gharavaalon tak pahunch gai he to ummid kii jaani chahie ki is arthi kaa puraa sach bhi jaldi hi benakaab ho jayega

 in se saabhaar) The purpose of the documentary on Nirbhaya has been fulfilled
 har dacumentry kii koshish hoti he ki log us par baat karen
 Return to the original subject under his pretext
 yahaan to bina dekhe hi kai logon ne alag-alag tareeke se ise dekh liya or kai angel se lekh tak likh daale
 i am not rejecting these articles, but the questions raised in them in a way lead to the memories of the Nirbhaya movement
 andolan ko dekhne ke najariye ko lekar satark karte hai or nae najariye kii guzaaish bhi paidaa karte hai
 Questions ranging from legal, freedom of expression to ethical questions have been raised
 film mekar, darshak, sarkaar, saansad, vakil, nariwadi kaaryakarta, patrkaar sab is bahes ke alag alag kirdaar hai
 In this regard, the documentary has forced everyone to express their opinion even after being seen, not seen
 positive or negative har tarah kii raay ai he
 Probably a documentary would have been made on Nirbhaya for this purpose
 dacumentry kisi bani he, is par bhi alag str par bahes chal rahi he
 Some have liked it very much and some have found it very common
 kai logon ne yah bhi likhaa he ki dacumentry kisi honi chahie thi
 What else could be included in this
 har angel se kuch na kuch nayaa dekhne or seekhney ko mila he
 Therefore, those who made the documentary should congratulate that they have once again brought everyone into the mood of the Nirbhaya movement
 har koi solah disambar ke aas paas ghoomane laga he
 Some people are rekindled through those memories, and some are also desperate as to why they have not changed
 bas prayaas yah hona chahie ki virodh yaa samarthan main bahes karte samay hamaari uttejnaa is str tak na pahunch jaae ki dimapur jaisi ghatana ho jaae
 Everybody became a mob and beat up the alleged accused of rape
 main baar-baar is bahes main ek angel dekh rahaa hum ki is dacumentry se bharat kii videshon main badanaami ho rahi he
 This is an attempt to brand India abroad, especially all its men, as rapists
 main samaj nahin paa rahaa hum ki ek dacumentry se bharat kii badanaami kaise ho rahi he
 Whether a documentary or film should be shown or not should be the basis of whether it will bring a bad name to India or not
 yah daleel usee phizul soch se aati he ki garibi dikhaakar kai log videshon main puraskaar le jate hai
 But with this argument what do you think about those leaders and political parties who make false promises and regain power in the name of removing poverty
 zaraa koi batayega is desh main garibi kahaan dur hui he
 If someone gets the highest reward by selling poverty, then he is our leader
 jo garibon ke bich helicopter se utarate hai, karod rupee kii car se jate hai or unhen sapane bechakar apane liye satta hasil kar lete hai
 Many rich leaders start telling themselves below the poverty line in the election that the poor would also be surprised that what has just come from the charted plane is also poor, so what are we
 nirbhaya dacumentry main jo do vakil api singh or emel sharma bhartiya auraton or apni beti ke bare main saanskrithik gyaan de rahe hai use ham kyon na dikhaaen
 In my opinion, even if there is slander of India, such lawyers should be shown
 kya ham un khabaron ko isliye dikhaanaa band kar den jinke dikhaane se bharat kii badanaami hogi
 Should we not catch the lies of the leaders, do not show the news of atrocities on the woman, do not show the news of corruption because it will bring disrepute to India
 kai netaa bolte rahete hai ki baar-baar balaatkaar kii khabaren dikhaane se paryaton par asar padataa he
 Should the media not show the news of rape? ek-do dikhaa de, magar chaar-paanch na dikhaaye kyonki paryaton par asar padegaa
 Then the government should also issue tourism advisory to the media so that you do not show the news of rape or any such news which may harm tourism
 ham bhi janata se kah den ki dekhie hamaara kaam desh kii arthvyavastha main yogadan karnaa he na ki aapke ilaake main hue balaatkaar kii reporting karnaa
 Even stupid things have their limits
 bharat kii badanaami kya deshbhakt hone kii nai catagori he
 If there is a general consensus on this, then tell us how this headline will be for you
 aaj bhi hamaare mantri ne barish se barbaad genhun ke kheton main chaar sone kii chidiya udate dekhi he
 But this brought India's infamy
 thik he is hedline ko duusare tareeke se likhte hai
 All birds in India have become gold
 kheton main sona lahalha rahaa he
 Grains grow in Europe and crow in the laws of penguins, in India all are gold
 ham kya baat kar rahe hai or kyon baat kar rahe hai is par gaur karnaa chahie
 Of course, you should watch the documentary according to the bad and better, but please do not see it because it does not bring a bad name to India
 agar aapako lagata he ki in sab baton se bharat kii badanaami ho rahi he to aap pehle us maansikta ko badal dijie, jisane sharma or singh jaise vakeelon ko jakad liya he
 Change the mindset on which a Mukesh Kumar is born
 us maansikta ko badal dijie jo bheed banakar kisi aaropee par vahashi kii tarah tut padati he
 If India's infamy is the new condition, then change the name of the censor board to the Indian Prevention of Infamy Board, where Pahlaj Nihalani saheb will continue to cut every scene which will bring India's infamy
 america ne loktantr samarthak pradarshnakariyon kii maangon ko puraa karne ke sambandh main misr sarkaar dwaara paryaapt kadam nahin uthaae jane par puri tarah asantosh jataayaa he
 The US has also warned that if the Mubarak administration does not take some concrete steps, the process of protests will increase further
 white house ke press sachiv rabart gibs ne apane niyamit samvaadadaata sammelan main kaha, ‘yah spasht he ki misr sarkaar ko apane logon kii aakankshaon ko puraa karne ke liye vastav main kuch thos kadam uthaane honge
 Gibbs told reporters, "I think that until the government does not fulfill the wishes of its people which they expect from the government, then we will continue to see the same view in Cairo, which is being met
" ’ unhone kaha, ‘yah spasht he ki sarkaar ne ve aavashyak kadam nahin uthaae hai jo misr kii janata dekhnaa chaahati he
 That is why more and more people are coming forward to register their complaints

 At the same time, many people did not like him in politics
 bahubali film main katappa kaa role karne vaale satyaraj ne rajnikant kii aadhyatmik raajnneeti par tanj ksaa he
 There has always been a clash between the two actors regarding ideology
 ek event main satyaraj ne kaha, aadhyatmik bijness kuch nahin bas ek bijness he
 a real leader is one who fights against injustice
 lekin kuch log ise bijness kii tarah le rahe hai or ise aadhyatmik raajnneeti kah rahe hai
 Cauvery Water Dispute: Unhappy with the SC decision, Rajinikanth and Kamal Haasanrajnikanth said on the Himalayan trip, "but what does that mean to us?" Do we go to the mountains to seek peace

 In Karnataka, the protests against 'bahubali-2', 'katappa' apologized! Please tell me, during the release of the film Bahubali-2, the controversy started over Satyaraj's anti-kannada statement on the Kavadi river
 isse karnataka ke log naaraaz ho gaye the
 After which the film was opposed in Karnataka

 Rajan Iqbal, who runs a bookstore at the New Delhi railway station, still remembers the days when the Hindi novels were among the best-selling books from his shop
 lekin aaj vah dinabhar main hindi sahitya kii ek kitaab bechney ke liye bhi sangharsh kar rahe hai
 Iqbal blames mobile and internet for ending the habit of reading books and for reducing the sales of interesting Hindi novels in pocketbook size
 ikbaal apni dukaan main na bike hindi ke upanyaason ke bandal kii ore ishaara karte hue ieenes ko bataate hai, 'yah bamushkil paanch varsh pehle kii baat he, jab aksar mere paas pratidin aise graahak aate the jo ek baar main hi 50-50 kitaaben kharidte the
 There were women from America who would often visit my shop and buy more than 75 books at the same time
 ikbaal udhaas man se bataate hai, 'aaj in pustakon kaa shaayad hi koi graahak ho, or iskaa ekmaatr kaaran intneret, atyaadhunik smartphone or laptop hai
 In the '80s, Hindi' pulp literature 'was at its peak and writers like Surendra Mohan Pathak, Ved Prakash Sharma, Anil Mohan and Gulshan Nanda were widely read
 lekin logon tak vibhinn madhyamon ke jariye internet kii pahunch hone ke baad se hindi sahitya kaa yah rochak bazaar apni chamak kho chukaa he
 Pathak, who has composed 300 novels, said, "there is no possibility of a competent writer or reader in this genre even in future, because now people are more interested in television, mobile or internet
" ' apane aupnyasik charitron 'sunil' or 'vimal' shrinkhalaa ke upanyaason ke liye mashhoor 75 varshiya pathak ne kaha, 'isse pocket books kaa vyapaar kam hua he
 There are now only a handful of publishers in Delhi and Meerut, compared to the 80–90 publishers of the 80s
 'apane rahasyamay evam romaanchak vishyon vaale or kam keemat main aasaani se uplabdh ho jane vaali hindi sahitya kii is vidha ko kabhi aupchaarik taur par hindi sahitya main shaamil nahin kiya gaya, lekin aam janata ke bich inaki lokapriyata se koi inkaar nahin kar saktaa
 These books were easily available between Rs 30 and Rs 150
 dhiraj pocket books ke kaaryakari nideshak pulkit jain ne bataaya, 'inaki lokapriyata ke peeche kharaab gunvattta vaale kaagajon par prakashit hone ke kaaran kam keemat vaala hona tha
 Jain, however, believes that even their low prices are not able to save their falling popularity, mainly because of the increasing use of modern technology, which is making the reading habit loose
 nai dilli railway stesan par hi ek anya pustak vikreta manoj kumaar bhi sahmati jataate hue kehete hai, 'paanch saal pehle tak jahaan jahaan roj 20 ke kareeb kitaaben bik jaati thim, aaj mushkil se do bhi nahin bik paati hai
 Manoj said, "I agree that now we have to struggle to sell these books

 ' khaane-pine kii chizon ko surakshit rakhane ke liye ham frij kaa istemaal karte he
 There is nothing better to store most of the food and drink
 kabhi kuch zyada ban jaae to bhi ham use barbaad hone se bachaane ke liye frij main rakh dete hai
 In most homes this method is adopted to keep things safe
 par hamamen se shaayad bahut kam logon ko hi ye pataa hota he ki har cheez frij main rakhane ke liye nahin hoti he
 There are many things that can be harmful to keep in the refrigerator
 inamen sekai chijen to aisi he jinhen frij main rakh dene seunka swaad badal jaataa he par kuch aisi bhi hai jinaki vajah se frij main badboo bhar jaati he
 In such a situation, it is very important to know which food and drink should be kept in the refrigerator and which things are not: 1
 olive oilkai gharon main olive oil ko bhi frij main rakhaa jaataa he
 Although olive oil should be stored in a cool place but not in the refrigerator
 frij main rakhane par ye gadha ho jaataa he
 Sometimes it becomes as thick as butter
 2
 Coffee: If you keep the coffee in the fridge, it will lose its flavor
 saath hi isaki gandh bhi badal jaati he
 Coffee should be kept in a dark and cool place
 aisi kisi jagah par rakhane se iskaa swaad or khushboo donon hi barkaraar rahete he
 3
 shahdashahd ko frij main rakhane kii koi zarurat hi nahin he
 It is always right if you remove it cleanly and close the lid after use
 4
 Keeping the breadbread in the refrigerator dries it very quickly
 agar aapako bread frij main rakhana bhi he to ise acchhee tarah lapetakar rakhen varanaa ye kadaa ho jaataa he
 Bread kept in the refrigerator should be used in two to three days
 5
 Keeping garlic garlic in the refrigerator starts germinating
 saath hi ye dhire-dhire galane bhi lag jaataa he
 It is better to keep the garlic in another cool place, away from sunlight, in the refrigerator
 6
 Onions: If you keep the onions in the refrigerator, they can thaw or become soft due to moisture
 pyaaj ko bhi lahasun jaisi hi kisi jagah par rakhana chahie
 One thing is that onion should never be kept with potatoes
 7
 Keeping potato in refrigerator, most of its starch is converted into sugar very quickly
 aaluon ko rakhane se pehle unhen kisi paper bag main lapet den or uske baad kisi thandi jagah par rakh den
 8
 tamatotmato ko frij main rakhane se wo apana swaad kho dete hai
 Keeping the fridge stops the tomato ripening process
 jisaki vajah se uskaa swaad prabhavit hota he
 9
 kelatmatar kii hi tarahakele ko bhi frij main rakhane se uskipakane kii prakriya par vipareet asar padataa he
 But if your brought bananas are cooked completely, then you can keep them in the fridge
 par agar aap do-teen din tak kelaa nahin kha pate hai to uskaa chhilka kaala pad jayega par andar wo thik bana rahegaa

 Yet why is there no hearing
 berojgaare se kisi ko dar kyon nahin lagata he
 There is a short answer to this
 jab kisaan andolan karte hai to baaki samaaj unhen chhod detaa he
 When unemployed perform, the rest of society also abandons them
 na kisaan berojgaaron kaa saath dete hai or na berojgaar kisaanon kaa
 Therefore, there is no strength of one's voice
 kai berojgaaron ne bataaya ki unke parivaar ke log bhi unka saath nahin dete hai

 First you read tippaniyan Government of Jharkhand is committed to provide employment in the state government
 sarkaar ke dwaara varsh 2016 ko niyukti varsh 2016 ghoshit kiya gaya
 So far, 62,896 posts have been appointed

 We have not read the full part of the letter

 The Jharkhand government, which has two departments, Jharkhand Public Service Commission and Jharkhand State Staff Selection Commission, is unable to complete the reinstatement of 1000-500 posts in two to four years, the Jharkhand government does more than 62 thousand reinstatements in a year
 ye bahaaliyaan kisne kii, kya lokseva ayog or rajya karmchaaree chayan ayog ne kii, yaa kisi or ne kii, hamaare paas pukhta jaankaree nahin he
 It is just information that youth of youth is getting wasted

 On January 22, some 1
5 hundred students took out a march at the CGO Complex in Delhi
 aas-paas ke rajyon se aae ye chaatr staff salection kamishan kii pariksha main paas ho chuke hai
 Their joining letter is not coming
 pehle pariksha ke liye intazaar karo, phir paas hokar jwine karne kii chitthee kaa intazaar karo
 So students who have passed SSC continue to perform in different cities
 inkaa maamla court main bhi lataka rahata he
 On the other hand, those who have not, they keep complaining that different levels of questions are asked on different days in the same exam
 kisi din paper halkaa hota he kisi din bahut baari hota he
 Those who have passed by pretending to have many complications are not joining
 hamaare sahyogi munne bharti 22 janvari ke march ke samay dilli ke sijio complex gaye the jahaan ye chaatr takhti binar lekar aae the
 On January 18, in Patna too, the students who had passed the SSC took out a rally
 aap chaatro kii baaten suniye phir aaraam se sochie ki is vakt kya karne kii zarurat he
 When the police tried to remove the students, they gave flowers and explained that they are peaceful
 in chaatro kaa kahana he ki ve jab court main gaye ki unki jwining jaldi ho jaae to is maamle kii sunwaayee kii taarikh 21 sitambar mili he jisase ve kaaphi pareshaan ho gaye hai
 After passing such a year will also pass in joining
 shuukravaar ko staff salection kamishan ke chairman ne apni sanstha kii website par deree ke kaarnon or samaadhaan par ek lanbaa patr daalaa tha
 Students still fear that this could be a way of hanging the case just by giving assurance
 patr ke point number 9 main kaha gaya he, 'kamishan ne disambar 2017 ko bharat sarkaar ke carmik vibhaag or kanoonee maamalon ke vibhaag se sampark kiya
 Permission is sought to appeal against the order of CAT in this case
 kanoonee samiksha ke baad sarkaar ne paaya ki ise dilli hoicourt main chalange karnaa chahie
 If needed, the commission will also go to the Supreme Court
 ayog janvari ke aakhri saptaah main apil file karegaa
 At the end of the month of February, a letter of joining will start coming from the departments for which the students have been successful
 yah durbhagyapurna he ki asafal ummidavaaron ke cese karne kii vajah se avaanchit deree hui he
 ' chairman ne apane patr main kaha he ki jinka ho gaya he, abhi safal logon ko jwining kii chitthee di jaaegi
 If the result is reviewed and someone's candidature is canceled, then his job will be lost
 is vyavastha ke saath paas hue chaatro ko jwine karaayaa ja saktaa he
 On 22 January, the chairman also called two students
 unase baat kii lekin chaatr santusht nahin hue
 India's youth are forced ahead of the system
 bihar ke muzaffarpur se ek chaatr ne hamen bataaya, aap bhi hairaan rah jaaenge
 The model of Jansunwai is currently running in prime time
 ham dhyaan rakhenge lekin pehle logon kii baat rakhenge, uske baad agar chayan ayog ke adhyaksh ko lagata he ki hamaari baat sahi nahin he, pratikriya deni chahie to ve hamase sampark kar sakate hai, ham unka jawaab bhi dikhaa denge
 Right now what the students have told is not believable in any mental state
 aap sunakar khud se yakeen kho denge
 In 2014, 13,500 vacancies for Bihar ssc chsl came

 On Friday, the chairman of the Staff Selection Commission had put a lengthy letter on his institution's website on the reasons and solutions for the delay
 chaatro ko abhi bhi ashanka he ki ye sirf aashwaasan dekar maamle ko latakaane kaa tarika ho saktaa he
 Point number 9 of the letter states, 'the Commission approached the Department of Personnel and Legal Affairs of the Government of India on December 2017
 anumati maangi ki is maamle main cat ke aadesh ke khilaaf apil kii jaae
 After legal review, the government found that it should challenge the Delhi High Court
 agar zarurat padi to ayog supreme court bhi jayega
 The commission will file an appeal in the last week of January
 farvari maheene ke akhir main jin vibhaagon ke liye chaatr safal hue hai, unke yahaan se jwining kii chitthee aane lagegi
 It is unfortunate that unsuccessful delays have occurred due to cases of unsuccessful candidates
 ' The chairman has said in his letter that those who have been, will be given a letter of joining to the successful people
 agar rigelt kii samiksha hoti he or kisi kii ummidavaari radd hoti he to uski naukari chali jaaegi
 Students passed with this system can be admitted
 22 janvari ko chairman ne do chaatro ko bhi bulaayaa
 Talked to him but the students were not satisfied
 bharat ke noujvaan vyavastha ke aage majaboor hai
 a student from Muzaffarpur in Bihar told us, you too will be surprised
 prime time main is vakt jansunwaayee kaa model chal rahaa he
 We will take care but will keep the talk of the people first, after that if the chairman of the selection commission feels that our point is not right, they should contact us, they can contact us, we will also show their response
 philhal chaatro ne jo bataaya he wo kisi bhi maansik avasthaa main yakeen karne laayak nahin he
 You will lose confidence by listening to yourself
 2014 main bihar ssc chsl ke liye 13,500 vekainsee ai
 One farm cost Rs 350, 27 lakh farms were filled
 is hisaab se ayog ne 80 se 90 karod chaatro se kama liye
 From 2014 to 2018, there has not been a single exam related to this vacancy
 22 janvari yani somvaar ke dainik jaagran main bhi yah khabar he ki bihar sarkaar ne inter stareey padon kii bhartee ke liye saal 2014 main aavedan nikaala, sarkaar ke alag-alag vibhaagon main 11,000 se adhik padon par niyukti ke liye sarkaar ne vaikency nikaali
 More than 18 lakh candidates filled the form
 bahut intazaar ke baad 2017 main pariksha kaa aayojan hua, lekin dhaandhlee hone ke kaaran pariksha radd ho gai
 After that the students are waiting for the exam again
 snaatak stareey pariksha ke liye bhi 2014 main notification jari hua tha
 Examination was held in 2015, PT was conducted, Mains examination was done, final result of the examination has come but the appointment letter has not been released
 paas kar ke bhi chaatr ghar baithe hai
 Another newspaper clipping shows that the Supreme Court has asked these selection commissions to make a recruitment calendar
 hindustan akhbaar ke abhishek kumaar kii is report main bihar rajya karmchaaree chayan ayog ke adhyaksh sanjeev sinha ne kaha he ki pariksha kaa calendar ban rahaa he
 There is a shortage of personnel
 bataaiye jiskaa kaam karmchaariyon kii bhartee karnaa he, uske paas bhi karmchaariyon kii kami he
 So first he should restore himself
 15-16 hazaar pad khaali hai, un par bahaali kii prakriya puri nahin ho rahi he
 Meanwhile, many students also lose their age limit, from part-time unemployment to lifetime unemployment
 naujavaanon ke saath hone vaala yah sabase bada ghotaalaa he
 Commissions have many excuses
 hamen railway ke parikshaarthi or rajasthan se badi sankhya main noujvaan patr likh rahe hai, aap dhiraj rakhie, ham aapaki bhi pareshaani dikhaa denge, jharkhand se hamaari report taiyaar thi magar 19 janvari ko dilli ke 20 vidhayakon kaa maamla aa gaya isliye ham nahin dikhaa sake
 Jharkhand Public Service Commission
 isaki imaarat to kaaphi thik thaak he, magar iskaa record bahut karaab he
 It has been 17 years since Jharkhand remained, but a single examination commission has not been done without allegations of rigging and corruption
 yah ayog rajya ke liye prashasnic adhikariyon kaa chunaav karata he jaise dipti collector, diespi, daaroga, tehseeldaar atsetra, atsetra, aadi aadi
 There is a shop filling the form outside the commission
 jab hamaare sahyogi harbans vahaan pahunche to ek bhi farm is ayog kaa nahin bik rahaa tha
 The restoration done by JPSC for batch number one and two was investigated after a few years and it was found that the place of examination has been rigged
 ab ham jo kahani bataaenge use dhyaan se suniega, yah sirf aapke bachche kaa sawaal nahin he, aapkaa bhi he, kyonki ho saktaa he ki inhen sab sarkari chaturaayiyon ke kaaran aap bhi acchhee naukari na paa sake hon
 So you can feel this prime time show with a back date
 yah ek aise imtahaan kii kahani jiskaa farm bharaa jaataa he janvari 2015 main lekin janvari 2018 tak koi ata pataa nahin he
 This story is from the Jharkhand Public Service Commission (JPSC)
 chhathi jepiessi pariksha kii he
 Advertisement for 326 posts of DSP, BDO, CO, Registrar, ADM came out
 janvari 2015 main iskaa vigyaapan nikalataa he
 The form is filed after eight months in August 2015
 chah maheene baad bataaya jaataa he ki silebus change ho gaya he, dobaaraa farm bharen
 Again students fill the form by paying Rs 500-500
 janvari 2016 tak yahi chalaa
 The form was filled for a year
 18 november 2016 ko piti kii pariksha hoti he, farvir 2017 main riselt aata he
 In PT, 5024 students passed but the result was found disturbed
 206 number vaala paas tha, usase adhik 260 number vaala fail tha
 After this there was agitation, the matter went to the state cabinet
 vahaan faisla hua ki 206 se upar ke sabhi chaatro ko paas kiya jaae
 Then in June 2017, the same decision came from the court, 965 students passed
 kahin aapane suna he ki cabinet kii meeting main katof tay hota ho, chaatro ke paas hone kaa nirnay hota ho
 However, January 2015 to June 2017 arrived
 do saal se zyaada samay lag gaya piti kaa rigelt nikal aane main
 Now listen to the story of its mains exam
 november 2017 main mens kii pariksha kaa date nikalataa he, lekin vah aprihaary kaarnon se sthagit ho jaati he
 It is not that no one is aware of this problem
 chaatro ne jo dhaandhlee ke kisse bataae hai unki pushti nahin kar sakaa hum magar aam baat ho gai he ki vahaan seat bik jaati he
 The students also met Jharkhand Chief Minister Raghubar Das regarding the Sixth JPSC problem
 ek nai taarikh nikali he ki 29 janvari 2018 se mens kii pariksha hogi magar chaatro ko bharosa nahin ho rahaa he
 The lives of many students were ruined
 aap unase baat kiijie, ro denge
 The parents of many passed away from the world, in this waiting son will pass the competition and become an officer
 ab ham jharkhand kii ek or pariksha kaa haal bataane ja rahe hai jise sunakar aapako bharosa hoga ki bharat ke yuvaaon ko kyon vahi vaala topic dikhaaya jaataa he
 So that they remain trapped in religious frenzy and cannot see the decline of institutions with their own eyes
 aapane abhi jharkhand lok seva ayog kii durdasha dekhi, ab aap jharkhand rajya karmchaaree chayan ayog kii dasha dekhie
 Advertisement for 551 posts comes out on 28 December 2015
 sayukt snaatak stareey pariksha kaa vigyaapan
 The last date of application is kept 28 January 2016

 Now the last date for filling the form becomes 15 March 2016

 You could understand some games

 You keep filling the form, we are engaged in making India a world guru
 baharhaal tisare vigyaapan tak aate aate padon kii sankhya 551 se badhkar 1080 ho gai
 Now, tell me who will not be expecting
 28 disambar 2015 ko jis pariksha kaa vigyaapan niklaa tha, uski praarambhik pariksha hoti he 21 agast 2016 ko
 Two hundred and thirty five thousand students had filled the form
 21 oktober ko prilims kaa pareenam aayaa, tay hua ki 27 november 2016 ko mens kii pariksha hogi
 On 13 November, newspapers show that the exam has been canceled
 nai taarikh kii ghoshnaa baad main hogi
 On February 4, 2017, the entire examination is canceled due to unavoidable reasons
 aprihaary kaarnon se
 It seems that the exams run away with Alien
 28 disambar 2015 se shuru hui pariksha kii prakriya 4 farvari 2017 ko radd hone par khatm hoti he
 Swaha for two years
 javaani swaha
 Dreaming
 ummid swaha
 That is why the same issue was brought on TV to make them feel that something is happening
 swaha ho rahaa he magar pataa nahin chale ki swaha ho rahaa he
 On 3 February 2017, the Jharkhand Department of Personnel issued a letter stating the reasons for the cancellation, a part of which we would like to hear from you
 agar aap ise sunate hi samaj jaaenge to main janvari main aapako aam khilaaungaa
 "earlier it was said that the result of 15 times of the total posts of 6 posts was published, only 1731 candidates applied for 250 posts of Agricultural Officer, Assistant Research Officer, so instead of 15 times what would be 3750, all 1731 candidates published the result
 was done
 3336 abhyarthiyon ko role number pad samooh 1 ke alaava duusare pad samooh main bhi shaamil ho gaye hai isliye vaastavik rup se 15 guna parinaam nahin he or 3336 abhyarthiyon ke mukhya pariksha main shaamil hone se vanchit hona pad rahaa he
 a meeting was held with the Chief Secretary, Chairman Jharkhand Staff Selection Commission headed by the Chief Minister
 isamen yah bhi vichaar kiya gaya ki praarambhik pariksha evam mukhya pariksha ke liye paathyakram kaa vishay ek hi rakhaa gaya he jiske kaaran vishisht padon ke liye vishisht yogyata se sambandhit gyaan kii jaanch nahin ho paati he
 If you have understood, then tell me
 do saal baad pariksha radd hone ke aise kaaran bhi naseeb se milte hai
 We understood that fewer people applied than the applications that came, so all were passed
 isliye radd kar diya gaya
 This is a picture of the five thousand letters that the students sent to the Prime Minister's Office
 isi 19 janvari ko pradhanmantri karyaalay se jawaab mila he
 The answer is less related to their questions but the claim that has been made is amazing
 pehle aap padhie
 The comments jharkhand sarkaar rajya sarkaar main rojgaar uplabdh karaane hetu patibaddh he
 The year 2016 was declared as 2016 year of appointment by the government
 ab tak 62,896 padon par niyukti kii chuki he
 The process of appointment of 36,661 posts is under process
 hamane patr kaa puraa hissaa nahin padhaa he
 But think jis jharkhand sarkaar ke do vibhaag, jharkhand lok seva ayog or jharkhand rajya karmchaaree chayan ayog 1000-500 padon kii bahaali do se chaar saal main puri nahin kar pate hai, wo jharkhand sarkaar ek saal main 62 hazaar se adhik bahaali kar detii he
 Who did these restorations, whether the Public Service Commission and the State Staff Selection Commission, or anyone else, did not have strong information about us
 bas yahi jaankaree he ki naujavaanon kii javaani barbaad ho rahi he
 Now it is not only God but also the support of pakoras
 chairman ne apane patr main kaha he ki jinka ho gaya he, abhi safal logon ko jwining kii chitthee di jaaegi
 If the result is reviewed and someone's candidature is canceled, then his job will be lost
 is vyavastha ke saath paas hue chaatro ko jwine karaayaa ja saktaa he
 On 22 January, the chairman also called two students
 unase baat kii lekin chaatr santusht nahin hue
 India's youth are forced ahead of the system
 bihar ke muzaffarpur se ek chaatr ne hamen bataaya, aap bhi hairaan rah jaaenge
 The model of Jansunwai is currently running in prime time
 ham dhyaan rakhenge lekin pehle logon kii baat rakhenge, uske baad agar chayan ayog ke adhyaksh ko lagata he ki hamaari baat sahi nahin he, pratikriya deni chahie to ve hamase sampark kar sakate hai, ham unka jawaab bhi dikhaa denge
 Right now what the students have told is not believable in any mental state
 aap sunakar khud se yakeen kho denge
 In 2014, 13,500 vacancies for Bihar ssc chsl came
 ek farm kii keemat 350 rupee thi, 27 lakh farm bhare gaye
 Accordingly, the commission earned from 80 to 90 crore students

 Passing students are sitting at home

 In this report of Hindustan newspaper Abhishek Kumar, Chairman of Bihar State Staff Selection Commission, Sanjeev Sinha has said that the exam calendar is being made
 karmiyon kii kami he
 Explain, whose job is to recruit employees, he also has shortage of staff

 is bich bahut se chaatro kii umr seemaa bhi nikal jaati he, ve anshkalik berojgaar se aaajeevan berojgaar ho jate hai

 Now, tell me who will not be expecting
 28 disambar 2015 ko jis pariksha kaa vigyaapan niklaa tha, uski praarambhik pariksha hoti he 21 agast 2016 ko
 Two hundred and thirty five thousand students had filled the form
 21 oktober ko prilims kaa pareenam aayaa, tay hua ki 27 november 2016 ko mens kii pariksha hogi
 On 13 November, newspapers show that the exam has been canceled
 nai taarikh kii ghoshnaa baad main hogi
 On February 4, 2017, the entire examination is canceled due to unavoidable reasons
 aprihaary kaarnon se
 It seems that the exams run away with Alien
 28 disambar 2015 se shuru hui pariksha kii prakriya 4 farvari 2017 ko radd hone par khatm hoti he
 Swaha for two years
 javaani swaha
 Dreaming
 ummid swaha
 That is why the same issue was brought on TV to make them feel that something is happening
 swaha ho rahaa he magar pataa nahin chale ki swaha ho rahaa he
 On 3 February 2017, the Jharkhand Department of Personnel issued a letter stating the reasons for the cancellation, a part of which we would like to hear from you
 agar aap ise sunate hi samaj jaaenge to main janvari main aapako aam khilaaungaa
 "earlier it was said that the result of 15 times of the total posts of 6 posts was published, only 1731 candidates applied for 250 posts of Agricultural Officer, Assistant Research Officer, so instead of 15 times what would be 3750, all 1731 candidates published the result
 was done
 3336 abhyarthiyon ko role number pad samooh 1 ke alaava duusare pad samooh main bhi shaamil ho gaye hai isliye vaastavik rup se 15 guna parinaam nahin he or 3336 abhyarthiyon ke mukhya pariksha main shaamil hone se vanchit hona pad rahaa he
 a meeting was held with the Chief Secretary, Chairman Jharkhand Staff Selection Commission headed by the Chief Minister
 isamen yah bhi vichaar kiya gaya ki praarambhik pariksha evam mukhya pariksha ke liye paathyakram kaa vishay ek hi rakhaa gaya he jiske kaaran vishisht padon ke liye vishisht yogyata se sambandhit gyaan kii jaanch nahin ho paati he
 If you have understood, then tell me
 do saal baad pariksha radd hone ke aise kaaran bhi naseeb se milte hai
 We understood that fewer people applied than the applications that came, so all were passed
 isliye radd kar diya gaya
 This is a picture of the five thousand letters that the students sent to the Prime Minister's Office
 isi 19 janvari ko pradhanmantri karyaalay se jawaab mila he
 The answer is less related to their questions but the claim that has been made is amazing
 pehle aap padhie
 The comments jharkhand sarkaar rajya sarkaar main rojgaar uplabdh karaane hetu patibaddh he
 The year 2016 was declared as 2016 year of appointment by the government
 ab tak 62,896 padon par niyukti kii chuki he
 The process of appointment of 36,661 posts is under process
 hamane patr kaa puraa hissaa nahin padhaa he
 But think jis jharkhand sarkaar ke do vibhaag, jharkhand lok seva ayog or jharkhand rajya karmchaaree chayan ayog 1000-500 padon kii bahaali do se chaar saal main puri nahin kar pate hai, wo jharkhand sarkaar ek saal main 62 hazaar se adhik bahaali kar detii he
 Who did these restorations, whether the Public Service Commission and the State Staff Selection Commission, or anyone else, did not have strong information about us
 bas yahi jaankaree he ki naujavaanon kii javaani barbaad ho rahi he
 Now it is not only God but also the support of pakoras
 ab ham jo kahani bataaenge use dhyaan se suniega, yah sirf aapke bachche kaa sawaal nahin he, aapkaa bhi he, kyonki ho saktaa he ki inhen sab sarkari chaturaayiyon ke kaaran aap bhi acchhee naukari na paa sake hon
 So you can feel this prime time show with a back date

 Two hundred and thirty five thousand students had filled the form
 21 oktober ko prilims kaa pareenam aayaa, tay hua ki 27 november 2016 ko mens kii pariksha hogi
 On 13 November, newspapers show that the exam has been canceled
 nai taarikh kii ghoshnaa baad main hogi
 On February 4, 2017, the entire examination is canceled due to unavoidable reasons
 aprihaary kaarnon se
 It seems that the exams run away with Alien
 28 disambar 2015 se shuru hui pariksha kii prakriya 4 farvari 2017 ko radd hone par khatm hoti he
 Swaha for two years
 javaani swaha
 Dreaming
 ummid swaha
 That is why the same issue was brought on TV to make them feel that something is happening
 swaha ho rahaa he magar pataa nahin chale ki swaha ho rahaa he
 On 3 February 2017, the Jharkhand Department of Personnel issued a letter stating the reasons for the cancellation, a part of which we would like to hear from you
 agar aap ise sunate hi samaj jaaenge to main janvari main aapako aam khilaaungaa
 "earlier it was said that the result of 15 times of the total posts of 6 posts was published, only 1731 candidates applied for 250 posts of Agricultural Officer, Assistant Research Officer, so instead of 15 times what would be 3750, all 1731 candidates published the result
 was done
 3336 abhyarthiyon ko role number pad samooh 1 ke alaava duusare pad samooh main bhi shaamil ho gaye hai isliye vaastavik rup se 15 guna parinaam nahin he or 3336 abhyarthiyon ke mukhya pariksha main shaamil hone se vanchit hona pad rahaa he
 a meeting was held with the Chief Secretary, Chairman Jharkhand Staff Selection Commission headed by the Chief Minister
 isamen yah bhi vichaar kiya gaya ki praarambhik pariksha evam mukhya pariksha ke liye paathyakram kaa vishay ek hi rakhaa gaya he jiske kaaran vishisht padon ke liye vishisht yogyata se sambandhit gyaan kii jaanch nahin ho paati he
 If you have understood, then tell me
 do saal baad pariksha radd hone ke aise kaaran bhi naseeb se milte hai
 We understood that fewer people applied than the applications that came, so all were passed
 isliye radd kar diya gaya
 This is a picture of the five thousand letters that the students sent to the Prime Minister's Office
 isi 19 janvari ko pradhanmantri karyaalay se jawaab mila he
 The answer is less related to their questions but the claim that has been made is amazing
 pehle aap padhie
 The comments jharkhand sarkaar rajya sarkaar main rojgaar uplabdh karaane hetu patibaddh he
 The year 2016 was declared as 2016 year of appointment by the government
 ab tak 62,896 padon par niyukti kii chuki he
 The process of appointment of 36,661 posts is under process
 hamane patr kaa puraa hissaa nahin padhaa he
 But think jis jharkhand sarkaar ke do vibhaag, jharkhand lok seva ayog or jharkhand rajya karmchaaree chayan ayog 1000-500 padon kii bahaali do se chaar saal main puri nahin kar pate hai, wo jharkhand sarkaar ek saal main 62 hazaar se adhik bahaali kar detii he
 Who did these restorations, whether the Public Service Commission and the State Staff Selection Commission, or anyone else, did not have strong information about us
 bas yahi jaankaree he ki naujavaanon kii javaani barbaad ho rahi he
 Now it is not only God but also the support of pakoras
 kahin aapane suna he ki cabinet kii meeting main katof tay hota ho, chaatro ke paas hone kaa nirnay hota ho
 However, January 2015 to June 2017 arrived
 do saal se zyaada samay lag gaya piti kaa rigelt nikal aane main
 Now listen to the story of its mains exam
 november 2017 main mens kii pariksha kaa date nikalataa he, lekin vah aprihaary kaarnon se sthagit ho jaati he
 It is not that no one is aware of this problem
 chaatro ne jo dhaandhlee ke kisse bataae hai unki pushti nahin kar sakaa hum magar aam baat ho gai he ki vahaan seat bik jaati he
 The students also met Jharkhand Chief Minister Raghubar Das regarding the Sixth JPSC problem
 ek nai taarikh nikali he ki 29 janvari 2018 se mens kii pariksha hogi magar chaatro ko bharosa nahin ho rahaa he
 The lives of many students were ruined
 aap unase baat kiijie, ro denge
 The parents of many passed away from the world, in this waiting son will pass the competition and become an officer
 ab ham jharkhand kii ek or pariksha kaa haal bataane ja rahe hai jise sunakar aapako bharosa hoga ki bharat ke yuvaaon ko kyon vahi vaala topic dikhaaya jaataa he
 So that they remain trapped in religious frenzy and cannot see the decline of institutions with their own eyes
 aapane abhi jharkhand lok seva ayog kii durdasha dekhi, ab aap jharkhand rajya karmchaaree chayan ayog kii dasha dekhie

 a new date has come out that from January 29, 2018, the mains exam will be held, but the students are not confident

 You will talk to them, weep

 Bihar Chief Minister and National President of Janata Dal United Nitish Kumar on Friday said clearly that there are no 'splats' in the alliance with BJP in the state
 nitish apane party ke rajya parishad kii baithak main bolte hue kaha ki is gathbandhan main khachapach karne vaala agle saal ke vidhansabha chunaav ke baad bure haal main hoga
 Nitish is certainly saddened by the recent rhetoric on his leadership by a group of leaders within the Bihar BJP
 bina naam liye unhone apane maujuud kaaryakartaaon se kaha, 'koi anaap-shanaap bol rahaa hai to bolne dijie, notice mat lijie
 Against the spokespersons, they said that you too should avoid giving feedback
 nitish kumaar ke rukh se saafe hai ki wo agle saal ke vidhansabha chunaav bijepi ke saath milakar ladenge
 Nitish's speech on Friday revealed that Khichdi is being cooked against him in the allies against his opponents
 lekin wo apane kaam par dhyaan kendrit kar jaan boojhkar unako baton ko taalte rahete hai
 That is why Nitish repeatedly said that the people who spoke about him before the Lok Sabha elections should see what the public has done to him
 aapako bataa den ki kuch din pehle hi kendriya mantri or bijepi ke netaa giriraaj singh ne rashtriya naagarik register (NRC) ke virodhiyon par nishaanaa saadhaa
 Apart from this, Giriraj Singh also indirectly targeted Nitish Kumar on the issue of article 370, triple talaq and NRC
 giriraaj singh ne kaha ki enarasi kii baat 'desh ke chashme se dekhen, vot ke chashme se nahin
 'the situation in Bihar is not demanding NRC, but circumstances
 simavarti jilon main jansankhya vrudghi 'demographic' badlaav bahut teji se ho rahaa he
 We are in pain because in the 80s we used sticks to drive out the Bangladeshis
 ' giriraaj singh ne ek anya twit main kaha, 'bihar rashtriya janatantric gathbandhan (NDA) par meri koi tippanee nahin he
 Just three months back in Bihar, we won 39 seats out of 40 on Modi ji's face
 abhi nitish ji bihar main rajg kii taraf se mukhyamantri hai
 People of Bihar sometimes suffer from differing opinions on issues of country interest, Section 370, triple talaq, NRC
 'nitish par nishaanaa sirf giriraaj singh ne hi saadhaa he aisa nahin he
 bjp's Legislative Councilor Sanjay Paswan said, "enough Nitish Kumar
" ab unhen dilli kii raajnneeti main janaa chahie or bihar kii gaddi bhaajapa netaaon ko dena chahie
 Paswan also told Chief Minister Sushil Modi of his choice
 janata dal united ke mukhya pravaktaa sanjay singh ne iske jawaab main kaha ki jab janata ne nitish kumaar ko janadesh diya hai tab is maang kii kya zarurat hai
 Not only this, senior BJP leader Dr CP Thakur said that NDA should contest the next assembly elections in the name of Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 unka kahana hai ki narendra modi kaa qad nitish kumaar se kaafii bada hai or haal ke samay main jaisi lokapriyata badi hai vaise main unke naam or chehre par ladane main zyaada faaydaa hoga
 However, the BJP high command and Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Modi have never questioned Nitish's leadership and made it clear several times that the Bihar assembly will be contested under Nitish Kumar
 lekin aisa lagata he kibijapi ke netaaon se aise bayaan ek ranneeti ke tahat dilwaaye ja rahe hai taaki rajya main janata kaa man tatola ja sake

 duniya ke mashhoor vaigyanik professor stephen hawking kaa nidhan ho gaya he
 He played his role in understanding the universe and he also contributed in understanding black hole and Big Bang theory
 isi bich jaanate hai aakhir unki big baing theory kya he?big baing theory brahmad kii rachana kii ek vaigyanik theory he
 This theory tries to explain when and how this universe was created? This theory was explained by Stephen Hawking
 is theory ke anusaar kareeb 15 arab saal pehle puure bhautik tatv or urja ek bindu main simati hue the
 Then this point started spreading
 big baing, bam visphot jaisaa visphot nahin tha balki isamen, praarambhik brahmad ke kan, samooche antariksh main fail gaye or ek duusare se dur bhaagane lage
 Stephen Hawking had told the disease the secret of success, had given this lesson to children, the credit for this theory goes to a scientist named Edwin Hubble who said that the universe is constantly expanding
 jiskaa matlab ye hua ki brahmad kabhi saghan rahaa hoga
 However, no one knows what was before it
 hawking brahmad kii rachana ko ek swatah sfoort ghatana maanate the
 However, the famous scientist Isaac Newton believed that there must be an author of this creation, otherwise such a complex creation cannot be created
 vahiin hawking ne tivi sho startok par bataaya ki bigbeng ke pehle aakhir kya hua karata tha
 During this time he told that it was more difficult than it was easy
 unke anusaar bigbeng se pehle kuch nahin tha
 Hawking had said that according to the Einstein General Theory of Relativity, space and time together have created a never-ending cycle of space and time in the world, but in reality it is not exactly flat, but because of the pressure of energy and material matter
 It is rotated among themselves
 yahi vajah he ki ise samaj paanaa aasaan nahin he
 No part of Stephen's body used to work except for the mind, this was because Stephen Hawking said that even before 'bigbang' time did not exist
 bigbeng ke pehle kii duniya ko lekar stephen hawking ne ek kaaphi nayaa vichaar is rakhaa he jo chaunkaane vaala he
 He says that there was no existence of time before Bigbang
 wo kehete hai ki oinstin ke siddhant ke mutabik brahmad kii utpatti ke samay sansar main maujuud sabhi bhautik padaarth or urja bahut hi choti jagahon par kendrit thi, lekin unki yah theory bigbeng ke pehle or baad kii condishan ke bich koi ganitiya link nahin bataati
 To say that in our country everyone talks about women empowerment, but even today there are some such things in Indian culture that only men are entitled to do
 shaadiyon main kuch rasm aise hote hai, jinhen sirf ladki ke pita hi puraa karte hai
 But breaking this practice, a London mother also performed the father's rituals at her daughter's wedding
 yah kahani he landan main rahane vaali haranur gareval kii
 Harnoor shared his wedding experiences on the Pink Laddu website, writing, 'we are five sisters
 hamaara koi bhai nahin he
 Our father left us for a few years, and since then my mother has raised us alone
 unhen jindagi main bahut kathinaaiyaan jhelni padin
 They brought us up in such a way that we never have to depend on any man in life
 unhone hamen apane pairon par khadaa hona sikhaaya
 So we told them that in the absence of Papa, you will perform the rituals and not any other man in the family
 'yahaan haath main jinda saanp lekar garba karti hai ladkiyaan
 
 
 Harnur has also written that it is difficult even today to remain single
 use parivaar vaale chaiyn se rahane nahin dete
 My father was also responsible for my father's departure, but my mother never gave up and brought us up in the face of challenges
 shaadi se pehle is mandir main dikhaanaa padataa he aadhaar card, kyonki
 
 
 Today everyone needs to take a lesson from Harnur's mother

 The Aam Aadmi Party government of Delhi has expressed disagreement over the 'e-way bill'
 sutron kii maane to sarkaar main vitt mantri manish sisodiya jiesti baithkon ke dauraan 'i-ve bill' kaa virodh karte rahe hai
 Meanwhile, traders have met GST officials and demanded a change in the instra state e-way bill
 jiesti council ke niyam ke tahat 3 june tak sabhi rajyon main intra-state i-ve bill lagu kiya janaa he
 The GST Council is under the central government, which handles the GST in all states
 jiesti rajya kaa tex nahin he, isliye sabhi rajya jiesti council ke niyamon se bandhe hue hai
 Under the rule, it is mandatory for all states to implement intra-state e-way bills
 kisi bhi ek rajya ke andar maal ko ek jagah se duusari jagah bhejne par lagane vaale intra-state i-ve bill ko lagu karne kii antim tithi 3 june he
 Except Delhi, all other states of the country have issued notifications to implement intra-state e-way bills
 sutron ke mutabik dilli sarkaar 'i ve bill' ke paksh main nahin hai lekin jiesti council ke niyamon ke chalate vah bhi iske liye baadhya he yahi kaaran he ki isaki antim taarikh 3 june hone ke baavjood dilli sarkaar ne instra state i ve bill ko lagu karne ke liye ab tak notification jari nahin kiya he jabaki desh ke anya sabhi rajya iske liye notification jari kar chuke hai
 The Delhi Tax Department has also held a meeting with the traders
 baithak main vyapaariyon ne maang rakhi he ki 'i ve bill' lagu naa ho or agar lagu hota bhi he to isamen jaruri sanshodhan karke iskaa sarleekaran kiya jaae
 Aam Aadmi Party Trade Wing convenor Brijesh Goel says that the Delhi government is in no hurry to implement the 'e-way bill' and in such a situation the government has promised to take a final decision after consulting the traders
 aam aadmi partytrade wing ke mutabik tex adhikariyon ne yah aashwaasan diya ki uchit maangon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue jaruri sanshodhano ke baad hi bijness friendli i-ve bill lagu kiya jayega
 The demand of the merchant class is the demand of the business class to be given exemption for the transactions between the merchant and the customer
 kyonki jab do vyapaareeyon ke bich vyapaar hota he to unhen ek duusare kii jaankaree hoti he
 But when a customer buys goods by giving incorrect information, and the goods officer gets caught on the way, the shopkeeper is fined or accountable
 iske alaava rosemara kii zaruri chizon jaise doodh, daal, chaaval yaa anaaj ko 'i ve bill' ke chhot ke daayre main laana chahie
 The Aam Aadmi Party wants the limit to be increased to 50 thousand, as found in the 'e way bill'
 darasal jiesti council niyam ke mutabik i ve bill 50 hajaar se adhik kaa saamaan kharidne par hi taiyaar kiya ja sakegaa
 Traders' problems In a meeting with the officials, the traders mentioned the technical problems coming from the 'e-way bill'
 chandani chowk, kashmiri get, khaari baawali, nayaa bazaar, sadar bazaar main internet kii bahut badi dikkat he jabaki i ve bill puri tarah internet par aadhaarit he
 In the e-bill, the information of the seller of the goods has to be given online such as train number, address, GST number
 i ve bill se aam vyapaaree ko sabase zyada mushkil hogi

 Tensions between Mayawati and the Congress are now reaching a peak
 darasal uttar pradesh main mahagathbandhan main congress ko shaamil na karne ke peeche mayawati kaa bada haath rahaa he
 One reason for this is the attempt of the Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi's team to break into the Dalit vote bank
 priyanka team se jude netaaon kaa netaa kaa kahana he ki party ab uttar pradesh main apane boote khadey hone kaa faisla kar chuki he iske liye party daliton ko lubhaana chaahati he
 Dalits were once the core vote bank of the Congress, but after the rise of BSP, Dalits have opted out of the party
 sarkari mashinari ke durupyog ke maamle main congress bhi bijepi se kam nahin
 The Congress has forcibly intimidated the BSP candidate in mp's Guna Lok Sabha seat, but the BSP will fight back on its symbol and now the Congress will reconsider continuing the support to the government
