 On the occasion of the release of Yuvraj's book, The Test of My Life, Tendulkar said, "when i went to meet him in London, i told my wife Anjali that i do not want my tears to come out when i meet her

 It was a touching evening when Tendulkar, captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni and young batsman Virat Kohli shared their experiences and expressed their feelings about Yuvraj's battle with cancer
 tendulkar ne bhavuk andaaj main kaha, ‘jab maine dekha ki meri patni yuvaraj ke saath chikitsakon kii bhashaa main baat kar rahi he to mujhe vishwaas ho gaya ki vah us sankat se baahar nikal aayaa he
 He is like a younger brother to me and i will ask God why such a disease happened to the Crown Prince
 ’yuvaraj ne bhi tendulkar ke saath pehali mulaakaat ko apane mazaakia andaaj main bayaan kiya
 He said, "my first thing to him was when i was looking at him fearfully in the dressing room and then suddenly he said," Please raise the biscuits here
 ’is par tendulkar ne kaha, ‘mujhe aaj tak ve biscuit nahin mili
 Yuvraj recalled India's win in the 2011 World Cup, saying, "dhoni doesn't talk much while batting but when he got out in the quarter-final against Australia, he said that Shabas Yuvi Jitake should come
" ’dhoni ne halke phulke andaaj main yaad kiya ki kis tarah se yuvaraj ne 2004-05 main bhartiya team main unka swaagat kiya tha
 He said, 'yuvraj said to me, "hey brother, what's going on?" sirf chakke maarane se kuch nahin hota
 Winning the match gets more praise
 ’ dhoni ne kaha, ‘pehle main use aap kahkar bulaata tha
 Then i came upon you and today you speak and speak
 ’yuva kohli ne kaha ki vishwa cap ke dauraan vah kaise yuvaraj ke kamare main gayi or paaya ki vah kaaphi khans rahe hai or unki teble par bahut davaaiyaan padi hui thi
 Kohli said, 'I asked him why are you coughing so much and he replied that because he has cancer
 mujhe laga ki yah unki logon se majaak karne kii aadat he
 i told him not to joke and went from the room
 ’is avasar par maujuud harbhajan singh ne kaha, ‘yuvi kii beemaari ke dauraan maine kabhi usase is bare main baat nahin kii or main keval us ladki ke bare main baat karata jisase vah dating karegaa or upachaar ke baad jab vaapasi karegaa to mujhase kis ladki se milvaayega

 The special thing is that the Election Commission also prevents the media from showing exit polls etc
 because it believes that such a poll sends a message to the voters about which political party the wind is blowing but such mega road shows and rallies His attitude remains soft

 Santner stayed on the wicket for 107 balls, when New Zealand's score was 255 runs
 iske baad rabindra jadeja ne karishmai over karte hue teen wicket jhatak kar newjiland kii pari ko aakhri kagaar par pahunchaaya
 As Watling, Ashwin dismissed New Zealand for 262, dismissing the last batsman
 santner ne abhi keval saat test khele hai, lekin green park ke spin trek par shanivaar ko unhone bhartiya spinneron ke khilaaf jis tarah se ballebaaji kii, use dekhte hue ummid kii ja sakati he ki ve bhavishya main bhi newjiland ke liye gend ke saath balle se bhi yogadan dete rahenge

 He first added 49 for the fifth wicket with Ronchi and then 36 with Watling for the sixth wicket
 tippaniyan New Zealand's innings did not take much time to collapse as Santner was dismissed as the sixth wicket

 After this, Ravindra Jadeja took three wickets in the charismatic over to take New Zealand's innings to the last brink
 watling ke rup main aswin ne antim ballebaaj ko out karte hue newjiland ko 262 ran par samet diya
 Santner has just played seven Tests, but looking at the way he batted against the Indian spinners on the spin track at Green Park on Saturday, it is to be expected that he will also be in the future with the ball for New Zealand
 Will also continue to contribute
 isse pehle is test main bharat ke liye ravichandran aswin ne bhi ballebaaji main 40 ran banane ke alaava chaar wicket bhi liye
 Both Ashwin and Santner are spin bowlers

 aresas ke prachaarak or rashtriya muslim manch ke sanyojak indresh kumaar ne ayodhya andolan ke karsevakon se jude bayaan mulaayam singh ke die bayaan ke baad unhen aade haathon liya
 Indresh Kumar called Mulayam even the dreaded criminal and the killer
 lakhanu main indresh kumaar ne bhashaa kii seemaa laangh di or kaha ki agar wo jinda rahegaa to or bhi hatyaein kara saktaa he
 Indresh Kumar said that Mulayam Singh can also kill Muslims for politics and the chair
 sangh ke is netaa ne adaalat or maanavadhikaar ayog se mulaayam singh ke khilaaf mukadmaa darj karne kii apil kii he
 Mulayam said- 16 kar sevaks could also be killed in place of 16
 Samajwadi Party supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav made a controversial statement during the release of the book based on his life struggle at the Indira Gandhi Foundation in Lucknow
 unhone kaha tha ki 1990 main karsevakon par goli chalaae jane kii ghatana par kaha tha ki usamen kul 16 log maare gaye the
 To save unity, even if we had to take 30 lives instead of 16, there would be no sorrow
 mulaayam ke bayaan par sangyaan le sanvaidhanik sansthaayenindresh kumaar ne kaha, 'mulaayam singh ne is baat ko sweekaar kar liya he ki vah ek bahut bada hatyara he
 He has done the work of killing innocent Ram devotees by sitting on the highest post of the state
 saath hi wo kah rahaa he ki zarurat padati to or goli chalavakar or bhi adhik logon ko maar saktaa tha
 He has confessed his crime
 uske liye main pradesh sarkaar se, pradesh ke maanavadhikaar ayog se, pradesh ke hai court se ye apil karuunga
 At the same time, i will appeal to the Government of India, the Human Rights Commission of India and also to the Supreme Court to give notice and file a case against such a dreaded criminal, because if the murderer will be alive and he will keep saying that he can commit more murders, then the country Instead of good governance and development, anarchy, violence and hooliganism will thrive
 desh kii janata loktantr main aise hatyaron ko kaise sabak sikhayegi ye desh kii janata tay karegi
 It is a serious matter that a murderer should roam freely and the Human Rights Commission, Supreme Court, High Court should not take cognizance against him
 in sab se meri prarthana he ki is bayaan kaa syriasli sangyaan le
 The government of the country and the state should guarantee the safety of the people from these crimes
 'jarurat padane par musalamaanon kii hatya karvaa sakate hai mulaayamunhone kaha, 'aisa he ki ye aparaadhpurna bayaan he
 The meaning of crime is that if they think that they are appeasing Muslims
 musalamaanon ko bhi ye samajhnaa chahie ki jo apni jati kaa, apane isht kaa nahin he, wo unka kab ho sakegaa
 This means Mulayam Singh is of the country, neither of religion nor of caste
 wo kisika nahin he wo keval apni tuchh raajnneeti kaa or kursi kaa he
 If he feels tomorrow, he can probably plot to kill Muslims
 isliye desh kii janata ko main kahuunga ki aise hatyaron kii sajeesh se wo saavdhaan rahen
 Be aware, if he takes the wrong decision then the results will not be good for Uttar Pradesh
 isliye main aisi tuchh raajnneeti karne waalon ke prati pradesh or desh kii janata ko saavdhaan karata hum
 They want a leader, they want a party that will take everyone along and develop everyone, who talks about the interests of everyone, who does not do politics of murders, hatred and waste
 jo vikaas kii, shiksha kii or bhaichaare kii raajnneeti kare
 Only then will those leaders and parties run

 After the government's decision, these hand salary of working women increased

 ranbir kapur or katrina caff starer jagga jasoos ko milijuli pratikriya hasil hui
 It had such an impact at the box office that Jagga Jasoos's team would not be very happy
 haalanki abhi ummid baaki he kyonki jagga ke 3 din kaa collection takreeban 31 karod rahaa he jo itnaa bura bhi nahin jitna film industry ko lag rahaa tha
 Jagga Jasoos's first day collection was 8 crores, the second day was 10
 75 karod or tisare din rahaa 12
 25 crores
 yani total veekend kaa collection rahaa 31 karod
 Success will not be achieved Barfi's good thing is that the graph of collection has increased every day
 trade magazine super cinema ke editor amul mohan ke mutabik- film kaa collection itnaa bura nahin he jo sabit karata he kiranbir kapur kii starpavarbarkaraar he
 The pace of Anurag Basu and Ranbir Kapoor's previous film Barfi also started slow at the box office but Barfi did a business of 98 crores
 haalanki jagga jasoos kaa graph badhane kii baavjood film kaa bhavishya ujjwal nahin hoga or barfi vaali safalataa nahin milegi kyonki film kaa bajet bahut zyada he
 Jagga's making and publicity together cost it 110 crores, which is impossible to recover
 trade panditon kaa ye bhi maananaa he ki jagga jasoos jaisi filmon se ek baar phir sabak lene kii jarurat he
 If not a flop, it would have been a hit if the film's budget had been between 50-60 crores
 ye puraa haftaa hone ke baavjoodajagga jasoos munaafaa nahinkma paayegi
 Yes, it is definitely not as big a flop as Ranbir Kapoor's Bombay Velvet was
 'bandaron' ne bigaad diya kheljagga jasoos kii apni kamiyon ke saath ise nuksaan hollywood kii spiderman or da planet of da eps ne bhi pahunchaaya
 Actually, the audience of both films got divided
 aise main bollywood ko hollywood se sabak lene kii sakht jarurat he varanaa kamjor film kaa phayda hollywood uthaa legaa
 Could have done more harm, if
 
 
 vahiin khabaron ke anusaar- jagga jasoos ko nuksaan or bhi zyada ho saktaa tha kyonki mana ja rahaa he ki 110 karod ke bajet main ranbir kapur or nirdeshak anuraag basu kii fees shaamil nahin he
 At the same time, Katrina also did this film at a very low fee

 salmaan khan jitne apane aapraadhik karnaamon ke kukhyata hai, utane hi apane khilaaf chal rahe maamalon ko lambey samay tak talavaate rahane ke bhi
 He was convicted by the trial court and to defer the verdict, he will now have to seek a higher court
 1998 main do kaale hiranon ke shikaar ke liye salmaan ke khilaaf mukadmaa darj hua tha
 On April 5, Niyati again followed him and a court in Jodhpur sentenced him to five years of imprisonment
 salmaan ko jodhpur kii central le jane kii taiyaariyaan chal rahi thim usee dauraan unke vakil seshan court main jamaanat kii arji daakhil kar rahe the taaki jaldi se jaldi unhen jamaanat par baahar nikaala ja sake
 If session court bail is not granted, an appeal will be made in the High Court
 jodhpur ke mukhya nyaayik dandadhikari (sijeem) ne salmaan ko sajaa sunai
 The prosecution argued that Salman had a habit of repeatedly committing crimes
 yah baat unke khilaaf gai or isse sajaa bhi zyada mili
 In the past, Salman has been sentenced in two cases by the lower courts but later acquitted
 inamen se ek maamle ko lekar rajya ne unhen bari kiye jane ke khilaaf apil kii he or is par faisla abhi lambit he
 He was also acquitted in the Arms Act
 adaalat ne jab sajaa sunai to salmaan ko gaharaa dhakka laga kyonki unhen jitani sajaa sunai gai he, vah unki ashanka se kahin adhik he
 He expected some punishment and his chartered aircraft stood ready to fly to Mumbai by noon
 is sajaa se yah baat sabit hoti he ki yadi maamle kii sahi tahakikat kii jaae to uske nattejey nikalate hai, bhale hi trial main kitna hi vilamb kyon na ho jaae
 But the acquittal of Salman's co-accused, as has been done in earlier cases, is a big relief for him and this will go in his favor at the stage of the appeal
 unke sah-abhiyukt saf ali khan, neelam, tabboo or sonaali bendre jo ki us samay salmaan ke saath the, unhen bari kar diya gaya he
 a local travel operator who was accused of taking them all on a hunt was also acquitted
 ye film stars ham saath-saath hai film ke liye shooting ko aae the or umed bhawan main tike the or ek shaam dushyant singh kii madad se ve shikaar ke liye nikle
 People have different opinions about this decision
 bishnoi samudaay ne isaki prashansa kii he
 The government said that it could consider filing a petition again against the acquitted people
 salmaan ke bahut se prashansakon or filmi jagat ke kuch diggajon ne sajaa ko jarurat se zyada sakht bataaya he
 He said that Salman has suffered for many years in the past and by his constant efforts towards charity, conservation, he has shown that his nature has improved a lot and now he remains active in social and responsible works
 Huh
 is cese ne logon ke dimag main yah baat to bitha hi di he ki vanyajeevon kaa shikaar pratibandhit hai or bharat main ise ek gambhir aparaadh mana jaataa he
 Saif Ali Khan's father, cricketer Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi, was also tried a few years ago on charges of killing Chinkara
 iske baavjood shikaar kii ghatnaayen hoti rahati hai
 This work is mostly done by professional criminals in the greed of eating the flesh of the wild animal or by greed for money
 aane vaale varshon main salmaan khan ko upree adaalaton se bari ho jaaenge yaa phir unhen sajaa ho jaaegi, yah to vakt batayega par ek baat to spasht he ki bharat main celebrity apane aparaadh kabhi sweekaar nahin karte
 There are many reasons for this
 pehla to yahaan aparaadh dand ko lekar kisi tarah ke saude (pli-bargen) kaa praavdhaan nahin he, jiske jariye gambhir aapraadhik maamalon main bhi sajaa ko kam karaayaa ja sake
 Second, there is no sense of forgiveness in Indian society over the confession of crime
 vah aise logon ke saath bahut kathor bartaav karata he
 The third reason is that celebrity criminals keep somewhere in their mind that they will eventually escape due to their influence, their money
 baat salmaan khan ko sajaa se khatm nahin ho jaani chahie
 Habitual hunters and professional hunters will also have to be punished severely by standing on their knees in front of the law, only then it can be controlled

 com Madan Mohan has been identified with his stories
 1975 se shuru hua unka lekhan lagaataar oonchaaiyon kii ore badhata rahaa he
 Madan Mohan, who has published five story collections so far, made a late foray into the field of novel writing
 isi saal chapa unka pehla upanyaas jahaan ek jangal tha purvanchal ke gaanvon kii yatharth tasviir pesh karata he
 In its objectification, the novel bears witness to the author's political rationality and ideological trends
 raajnneetik pakshadharata vaale lekhakon se yah ‘‘chook’’ aam he ki ve rachana kii kendriya samasya kaa samaadhaan dene ke lobh kaa sanvaran nahin kar pate
 Madan Mohan has saved himself from this fear
 apane paatro ke prati unki nirmamata shrilaal shukla kii yaad dilaati he
 Gorakh Nand (sahai), the protagonist of the novel, returns to his native village Malepar after retirement from a government job
 yah lautnaa gaanv main basane ke liye nahin he
 He has come with the intention of settling his land and property by owning it
 atikaraman hataane kii uski koshishon ke darmyaan badale hue gaanv kii sachaaiyaan apni puri jatilta main ujagar hoti hai
 The atmosphere created by the new kind of politics in the village has upset the old grammar of relationships
 ek khalipan pasra hua he
 Whom to trust? The relations in which Gorakh had unwavering faith betrayed him
 vishwaas kii sabhi deevaaren ek baargi darak gayi
 Renu's new political forces, showing the emergence of moral demise of the ruling characters in Maila Anchal, is the process complete in the novel presented
 parati pariktha kaa nayak jittan parati jameen ko kheti laayak banane ke liye kutsit raajnneeti kaa anubhav lekar or saath hi uskaa shikaar hokar paranpur lautataa he
 The political landscape of Paranpur is a miniature version of national politics
 idhar jahaan ek jangal tha kaa malepar gaanv daladhaarit raajnneeti ke vyaktigat istemaal kii abhinav baangi pesh kar rahaa he
 The fields of Gorakhnandan are also lying fallow
 uski tarunai kii premika pakhi usee kii jameen par jhopadi daale hue he
 Hopefully, Gorakh should stick one foot on this deh
 gorakh kaa malepar main kul 38 din thaharnaa hua
 It also includes days spent in the district jail by plotting a budding occupier of the village, Dharmadev Yadav
 jail se baahar nikle to gorakh ek nirnay le chuke the
 Gorakhnandan, who had come to the village to sell farmland to raise funds for an ambitious project to develop the vaccine for the developmental infarctalis, was the only son of America, realizing the reality
 ve america company ke bhartiya dawa bazaar ko duhane dene main saajheedaar nahin bananaa chaahate
 They also do not want their land lying in the clutches of the occupiers
 is changul se jameen ko mukt karana unke vash main nahin
 They search for an alternative in an unsympathetic state
 malepar main librari chalaane vaale rakesh baba ko ve patr likhte hai
 Rakesh is currently missing

 The flame of hope is flickering here

 The GSB pandal on Kings Circle in Mumbai is no less than any other pandal in any case
 is pandal main viraaje bappa bhi manokamana purti ke bhagwaan kahe jate he
 The GSB pandal is the largest Ganesh pandal in Mumbai and that is the reason why the pandal has been insured for the entire 13 crore
 is pandal main shahar ke rasookh daar bhakt darshan or puja ke liye aate he
 Let us tell you why the statue of GSB Pandal has been insured for 13 crores
 is murti ko sajaane main 60 kilo sone ke or 170 kilo chaandi ke aabhushanon kaa istemaal kiya gaya he, sone chaandi ke alaava kai bappa ke jewaron main tamaam keemtee pathar heere or moti jade hai
 Last year, the insurance amount of all these jewelery was around 7 crores
 lekin is baar sone chaandi ke bhav bad gaye hai lihaaja beemaa kii rakam ko badhaakar kareeb 13 karod kar diya gaya he
 For which GSB service Ganesh Mandal is paying a premium of more than two and a half lakhs to New India Insurance
 jiesbi seva ganesh mandal ke adhyaksh dinesh pai ke mutabik is baar sone kaa daam kaaphi bad gaya he, is saal sajaavat main kareeb 10 kilo sone kaa aabhushan or badha diya he
 The insurance thief covers every incident like robbery, terrorists, sabotage or natural damage
 13 karod ke insurance main 1 karod rupee sone ke jevaraat ke liye he jabaki baaki rakam- chaandi or naginon ke liye hai
 From the sitting throne of Ganesha, his hands, his ears, his crown, his armlets and tilak are made of gold
 ganesh kii sawari yani chuha bhi chaandi kaa he
 Significantly, this insurance amount of 13 crores is only and only of Ganesh Murthy
 jabaki duusare ganesh mandal bhagwaan or bhakton kaa paikaj saath main le rahe he
 Therefore, this Ganesh idol is called the richest Ganapati of Mumbai
 mumbai or pune main vinayak kaa insurance karaane kii hodavighnaharta jise kisi vighn kaa dar nahin hota? lekin ganpati ke bhakton ko apane bhagwaan kii salaamati kaa dar sata rahaa he
 Perhaps that's why there is a competition to get Vinayak insured in Ganpati mandals of Mumbai and Pune
 yah insurance lakhon main nahin, balki karodon main he
 The glory of the Raja of Lalbagh in Mumbai is unique, every devotee wishes during the Ganesh festival days that if one gets a glimpse of the king, then life will be successful
 is baar bhi raja puri taiyaari ke saath viraajane ko taiyaar hai, khaas baat yah he ki aayojakon ne is baar raja kaa baari bharkam beemaa karavaaya he, ji haa is baar lalbaag ke vinayak kaa paanch karod kaa insurance karavaaya gaya he
 In the Lalbagh area of central Mumbai, the Raja of Lalbagh is established for the last 76 years
 manyata he ki bappa ke aage jisane bhi mannath maangi wo jarur puri hui, isliye lalbaag ke ganesh ko muraadon kaa raja bhi kehete hai
 Lakhs of devotees throng here in 11 days of Ganesh Utsav
 bheed umadane ke apane khatre bhi hai, lihaaja aayojak kisi tarah kaa jokhim nahin lenaa chaahate or yahi vajah he ki bappa kaa baari bharkam beemaa karavaaya gaya
 In the insurance cover, not only the idol of Vinayak but also the devotees who come to visit the pandal are kept
 yani bephikr hokar kiijie bappa ke darshan or mannaton kaa pitara bharkar ghar lautie
 Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Yadav has said that training camps of terrorists should be identified and attacked immediately
 unhone kaha ki uri main shahid hue 18 javaanon ke liye yahi sachhee shradhanjali hogi
 Tejashwi questioned the center and asked what is being awaited now
 unhone kaha ki pradhanmantri narendra modi ke haathon ko kisne baandh rakhaa he
 After the sacrifice of the soldiers, it should be clear what the government's move will be
 lekin saath main tejasvi ye bhi kehete he ki inhen pataa hi nahin he ki hamalaa kahaan karnaa he
 He suggested that we should have a system like the US
 jahaan bhi aatankwaadiyon kaa camp ho usko chinhit kar karrwai kerani chahie
 Expressing concern over Kashmir, 'tejashwi said that Kashmir is being taken out of our hands' to give 5 lakh or 10 lakh to the families of the martyrs
 aise main thos kadam uthaane kii jarurat he
 Therefore, the central government should tell what it is going to do
 bihar main shaheedon ke parijanon ko sahaayta raashi ko lekar uthe vivaad par viraam lagaate hue upmukhyamantri ne kaha ki shaheedon ke sammaan main koi kami nahin honi chahie
 To give 5 lakhs or 10 lakhs is politics
 shaheedon ne jo desh ke liye kiya uski bharpai karodon rupe dekar bhi nahin kii ja sakati he
 The Bihar government is with the family of the martyrs

 Jharkhand Cricket Association President Subodh Kant Sahay and Cricket Association of Bihar Secretary Aditya Verma made serious allegations against n Srinivasan saying that the ICC chairman played an important role in getting the England pacer a clean chit to save his chair
 sahay ne kaha, 'en shrinivasana jo ki vivaadaaspad paristhitiyon main isisi chairman bane, unhone parde ke peeche se kathputli master kii bhoomika nibhaai or jadeja-anderson maamle main bisisiai ne laaparvaahee barti
 'srinivasan and his faction in BCCI made India a laughingstock globally
 anderson par aarope lagaaya gaya tha ki bharat or england ke bich nottingham main pehle test cricket match ke duusare din lunch ke samay unhone jadeja ke liye apshabd kahe the or unhen dhakka diya tha
 The ICC Judicial Commission, however, held both these players innocent
 sahay ne kaha, 'shrinivasana ne england evam wales cricket board (isibi) or isisi ko yah masalaa hijank karke apane paksh main karne kii chhot di
 'if Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni is to be believed, Anderson had uttered abuses for Jadeja
 khabaron ke anusaar anderson ne bhi sweekaar kiya tha ki unhone galat vyavhaar kiya tha, lekin isisi ne unhen paak-saaf qaraar diya or yah sab shrinivasana ke sheersh pad par rahete hue hua
 Former Union Minister Sahay alleged that Srinivasan did not allow Anderson to be punished for saving his chair
 unhone kaha, 'kya shrinivasana ko dar tha ki isibi or cricket australia unhen baahar kar denge kyonki ve jaanate hai ki vah galat tareeke se isisi chairman bane hai
 In this case it seems that an agreement was reached between Srinivasan and the ECB, which did not punish Anderson
 'bisisiai ne nyaayik ayog ke adhyaksh gordan louis ke faisle ke khilaaf apil kii lekin isisi ne use naamanzoor kar diya
 The board then asked for a change in the ICC code of conduct, but Srinivasan himself said that it was not needed
 sahay ne kaha, 'shrinivasana isisi main amulchul badlaav kii baat kar rahe the, lekin ab vahi shrinivasana bol rahe hai ki isisi aachaar samhita main badlaav kii jarurat nahin he
 He also objected to sending Sundar Raman and Sudarshan Raja as BCCI representatives at the ICC hearing
 sahay or verma ne iske baad board ke purv adhyakshon sharad pavaar or jagmohan daalamia se apil kii ki vah board ke agle maheene hone vaale chunaavon main shrinivasana ke dami ummidavaar ko sheersh pad par aane se rokane ke liye pahal karen
 Varma said, "this time the BCCI president will be formed from the eastern region but Srinivasan is trying to put his dummy candidate in this position
 hamaari pavaar or daalamia se apil he ki vah bisisiai ko bachaane ke liye aage aaen

 He had taught Doha and said - In Kalyug, father will go to exile and son will rule
 unhone kaha tha- main apana puraa samarthan netaji ko detaa hum, unka avmaananaa party kaa anushaasan bhang karne ke samaan he
 Whatever work people are doing against him (mulayam), it is absolutely unconstitutional, immoral and wrong

 ab tak jahrili sharaab ke seven ke kaaran 109 logon kii maut ho chuki he
 State's Excise Minister Jai Pratap Singh, in an exclusive discussion with Ajatak, admitted that there was a big lapse from the Excise Department in the poisonous liquor case and it is a result of the lapse that so many deaths have occurred
 unhone yah bhi mana ki kahin naa kahin police kii mileebhagat yaa phir laaparvaahee bhi iske liye jimmedaar he
 Dozens of policemen have been suspended at various places ranging from Kushinagar and Saharanpur to the police

 According to him, only 36 deaths have been confirmed as official figures, but this figure may also increase
 mantri ke mutabik abhi tak yah saaf nahin he ki jahrili sharaab main kya mila tha, jisase yah itani jaanaleva sabit ho gai
 They did not find any rat killing drugs
 They also said that apart from ethyl alcohol, investigation is being done on whether any rat killing drugs were found
 Only in a high-level investigation report will be able to reveal which chemical was adulterated in the poisonous liquor

 He also said that action should have been taken long ago
 uttar pradesh kaa aisa koi jila nahin jahaan number do kii sharaab nahin bik rahi
 Taking the Akhilesh government in this case, Shivpal said that the situation was the same in our government, but if we raised our voice, he had to suffer the brunt

 Jolly was with them that afternoon
 is baar phir usne hriday sambandhi samasyaon ko mrityu ke kaaran ke rup main pesh kiya
 The police suspect that the two murders boosted her courage — because her husband Roy also died after eating her cooked food in October 2011, three years after Tom's death
 is baar roy ke mamaa mathew manjadiil ne postmortem karaane par jor diya
 The postmortem at Kozhikode Medical College confirmed potassium cyanide in Roy's body
 jolly ne nayaa spashtikaran diya ki roy ne karj ke kaaran aatmahatya kii
 He urged the family not to talk about it and not to spoil the family's reputation
 police ne yah maamla darj kiya tha, par jolly ke bayaan ke aadhaar par jaanch band kar di
 Jolly also allegedly used political contacts to bury the incident
 par mathew ne uske spashtikaran ko maanane se manaa kar diya
 This resulted in a fourth murder in the family

 iske turant baad alphine gambhir rup se biimaar pad gai
 He was rushed to the hospital where he died two days later on 3 May
 jolly par is baar bhi kisi ne andeh nahin kiya kyonki alphine ko dama tha or janm ke baad se hi uskaa ilaaj chal rahaa tha
 Jolly's last victim was Alfine's mother
 janvari, 2016 main vah saili ke saath daanton ke doctor ke paas gai
 In the clinic itself, he allegedly mixed poison in a glass of water and gave Sily to drink
 saili kii mrityu par kisi ne na to andeh jataayaa, na postmortem kii maang kii
 a year later, Shaju and Jolly got married

 On the basis of Rojo Thomas report, when police started investigating the deaths, it was concluded that all these were murders
 mathew manjadiil ne jolly par bharosa karne se manaa kar diya tha
 Consequently, he became the fourth victim in a total of six murders in the family, between 2002 and 2016, Jolly used cyanide to kill her in-laws, her husband and three other relatives

 When Tanya felt fever a day before joining the new office, she ate the medicine
 sochaa oktober he or mausam badal rahaa he isliye aisa ho rahaa hoga
 But by nightfall, Tanya's fever reached 104 degrees
 puraa bukhaar sir par
 The husband put a cold bandage overnight but did not get fever
 agle din hi hospital gaye
 The doctor immediately asked for a test of dengue which came positive
 roj platelets monitor karne ko kaha gaya magar ultiyaan, chakkar, kamajori hone lagi
 Fever that does not take the name of landing
 lekin tanya tab tak hospital main admit nahin huin jab tak platelets 30 hajaar se neeche nahin pahunch gaye
 Done wrong unhen turant hi isiu main admit kar diya gaya
 The next morning when the nose started bleeding, the doctor immediately asked to offer fresh platelets
 halaat kaaphi critical the
 Which is called Touch and Go
 kaise bhi karke fresh platelets aae phir ja ke tabiyat sanbhalee
 When Tanya reached home after 4 days of discharge, she was very weak for a month
 tabhi se wo saal bhar machharon se saavdhaan rahati hai
 Whether it is morning or night
 unhen ye baat pataa chal chuki thi ki ek machhar bhi jaanaleva ho saktaa he or dengue to baar baar aa saktaa he, saal main kabhi bhi
 It needs to be saved throughout the year
 doosraa kissa bhi padhi likhi simran se judaa hua he
 Simran's 5-year-old son had fever
 naa kha paa rahaa tha, naa so paa rahaa tha
 Just kept on suffering in fever
 bas bukhaar main tadapata rahata tha or rota rahata tha
 Simran's father-in-law said that the son may have had dengue
 simran ne doctor ke paas jane kii baat kii to sabhi ne kaha ki wo phaltu ke test karaayenge, mahangi dawa denge, gharelu nuskhe se betaa jaldi sahi ho jayega
 But the son's condition continued to worsen, worsening continuously
 phir ek din wo achaanak behosh ho gaya
 Was breathing lightly
 ye sab dekhakar simran ke pati use jabardastee doctor ke paas lekar gaye
 He did well otherwise the son's life might not have survived
 uske platelets 10 hajaar pahunch gaye the
 He was admitted to the ICU
 blad test karakar platelet chadaaye gaye tab jaakar haalat sanbhalee
 He remained in the hospital for 10 days
 simran kaa betaa itnaa kamjor ho gaya tha ki kai din baad hi wo solid diet le sakaa
 He remained on a liquid diet for a long time
 simran ne usee din se thaan liya ki apane bachche ko 12 maheene machhar se bachaakar rakhengi or kuch bhi ho jaae sidhaa doctor ke paas jaaengi
 May also have to be taken from a mosquito
 
 
 bachanaa jaruri he
 Knowing the crisis of Tanya and Simran, you must have also understood that dengue is actually a disease of 12 months, not just rain
 aapako dengue kii giraft main laane ke liye ek machhar kaa dank hi kaaphi rahata he
 And if you have gone through the dengue phase once, it does not mean that you cannot have it again
 samaj lijie ki privansion hi better dein kyor
 To avoid dengue, you should eat immunity enhancing foods, exercise, do not have water stored in AC vents or flower pots
 dengue hygiene kaa hi vishay nahin he balki sanbhalkar rahanaa bhi jaruri he
 dengue 
 godarej ke is spray kii takat se ghar ke kone kone main chhipe machharon kaa ant ho jaataa he
 And not only you, but your child also falls asleep
 sarkaar ko vastu evam seva kar (jiesti) vidheyak paarit karaane ke liye jaruri vot is saal hasil ho sakate hai

 Increasing support for GST In recent times, due to the deadlock in the Rajya Sabha, investors' expectations regarding the GST Bill have cooled down
 haalanki, morgan stanley kaa maananaa he ki rajyasabha mengstike liye samarthan batch rahaa he

 iske ghatakar 82 par aane ke baad vidheyak paarit ho jayega
 We anticipate that this will happen by July 2016

 Mulayam Singh and Shivpal Yadav have reached the party office
 donon netaaon ne party kaaryakartaaon se mulaakaat kii
 Mulayam Singh Yadav spoke among the party workers in Lucknow
 mulaayam ne kaha bahut sangharsh ke baad samaajawaadee party bani he
 We gave time for the unity of the party
 party kii ekta main koi baadha naa daale
 On Akhilesh, Shadha Nishamulayam said that we took every step for the unity of the party
 jo hamaare paas tha, sab diya
 Mulayam said you are always with us
 is bich vahaan maujuud kaaryakartaaon ne mulaayam singh jindabad ke naare lagaae
 Mulayam told the workers that your concern is natural, because the party is made up of a big struggle
 unhone aage kaha ki main dilli gaya tha kii hamaari party kii ekta main koi baadha na daal paae
 Taking a dig at the Akhilesh group, Mulayam told the SP workers that neither we are forming a separate party or changing the symbol
 wo (vipakshi gut) duusari party bana rahe hai
 Angered with Ram Gopal, Mulayam Mulayam was very angry with Ram Gopal Yadav and said that he was already in the making of the All India Samajwadi Party with a motorcycle symbol
 ramgopal par bijepi se mili hone kaa aarope lagaate hue mulaayam singh yadav ne kaha ki agar unhen apane bete or bahu ko bachaana tha to dusron ke paas jane se acha tha ki unase madad maangate
 Mulayam wanted to assure his workers that he would not let the party break up
 akhilesh kii chunaavon par najarais bich, uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ek taraf apni hi party ke dangal main fanse hue hai to vahiin duusari taraf unki najar chunaavon par bhi hai
 Akhilesh Yadav and his camp are not only focusing on the ruckus in the party and family, but also in alliance with Congress and Rashtriya Lok Dal for the upcoming assembly elections
 akhilesh khmeke bade netaa jaise ramgopal yadav party main mache bavaal or chunaav chihn ko lekar chunaav ayog main chal rahe masale par dhyaan kendrit kar rahe hai to vahiin sutron se khabar he ki duusari taraf akhilesh yadav congress ke saath siton ke faislon par vichaar-vimarsh main lage hue hai

 According to sources, initially the Congress had demanded 140 seats and RLD 50 seats
 lekin parde ke peeche chal rahi baatcheet ke anusaar donon partiyaan kuch siten kam karne ko taiyaar hui hai
 There is no final seal yet
 lekin mana ja rahaa he ki sapa 300, congress 78-80 or baaki siten areldi ko di jaaengi
 Ever since the trailer of Shahid Kapoor, Alia Bhatt, Kareena Kapoor and Diljit Dosanjh's film 'udta Punjab' has been released, it has been fiercely discussed among the fans in the industry
 film ke trailor ko abtak 40 lakh se zyada log dekh chuke hai
 In this trailer being a hit on social media, all the actors are seen in funny characters
 haal hi main film menshahidke rockstar kirdaar tommy singh ko lekar yah khabar he ki yah kirdaar rap staryo yo hani sinhaper besd he
 However, filmmakers have denied this
 punjab main drugs kii duniya par besd is film mentomi sinhako ek jane maane rockstar ke kirdaar ke taur par dikhaaya gaya he jo ki apane kariyar kii ucchayinyon par he lekin drugs main lipt he
 a source attached to the film's unit told the English newspaper DNA that everything related to this film Rockstar is similar to Punjabi rock star Honey Singh, so somewhere his image has to come
 vaise main yah kahana chaahunga ki shahid kapur kaa kirdaar yo yo hani singh se zyada wild or gussell he
 This character is a wild character who is heavily immersed in drugs
 shahid ke is rockstar kirdaar ko yo yo hani singh ke saath jodne kii ek or khaas vajah bhi he
 In fact, just as Tommy Singh has been shown to be absorbed in drugs despite being successful in the trailer, the same condition of Yo Yo Honey Singh was told a few months ago
 jabahani sinhakaa bollywood main top rap star ke taur par naam chaaya hry tha tabhi achaanak unhone apane kariyar se you turn le liya or kareeb 18 maheenon tak industry se gaayab rahe
 The reason for this was stated that Honey Singh is undergoing treatment at a rehabilitation center in Chandigarh due to drug addiction
 lekin khud hani singh kaa kahana he ki vahabipolar disorderke shikaar ho gaye the
 But Tommy Singh's character in 'udta Punjab' is really based on Yo Yo Honey Singh, it will be known only when the time comes

 bataa den,aayran fistohar teen saal baad hota he
 If the Indian opener Virender Sehwag plays the game at the crease for a while, then the stance of the match changes but in the world his plan is to increase the odds of his rivals by playing full 50 overs
 vah abhi tak vanade match ke puure 50 over nahin khel sake hai
 Sehwag said, 'I think i have never played 50 overs in one day cricket
 abhi tak maine 43 yaa 44 over khele hai
 But this time i will bat for 50 overs and try to give the team a good start
 main pichley 10 varshon se 50 over tak ballebaaji karne kii koshish kar rahaa hum or asafal rahaa hum lekin prayaas abhi tak jari he
 "A lot of expectations are being raised this time but Sehwag said that he is not feeling pressured as captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni and coach Gary Kirsten have asked him to play his natural game, irrespective of the conditions
" sahvaag ne kaha, ‘koi bhi mujhe yah nahin kah rahaa ki mujhe kya karnaa hoga, yah hamaari team kii acchhee baat he
 The coach and captain have asked me to bat as i do
 isaliye ve mere upar koi dabaav nahin badha rahe hai
 All he has said is to play his natural game
 agar tum ran bana sako to ham khush honge lekin agar tum aisa nahin kar pate to bhi ham khush honge
 Sehwag said, "my role is to get the team off to a good start
 agar main 10 gend main 20 ran banaata hum yaa 70 yaa 80 gend main 100 ran banaata hum to main isse khush hum
 The 32-year-old's style is to take an aggressive approach as soon as he comes to the crease, but Sehwag said that he has reduced his aggressive attitude slightly
 unhone kaha, ‘pichley teen varshon se main acha kar rahaa hum or maine thodaa badlaav bhi kiya he
 Now i pay a little respect to the new ball
 main sunishchit karata hum ki main gendbaajon par haaavee hone se pehle chaar-paanch over khel luun or phir team ko acchhee shuruuaat dilaane kii koshish karun
 "sehwag said," i know that in the middle order we have Dhoni, Virat Kohli, Yusuf Pathan, Yuvraj Singh and Suresh Raina so i can be aggressive with the first ball
 lekin ab main teen-chaar over khilne ke baad sunishchit karata hum ki main team ko acchhee shuruuaat duun
 'he has scored a lot of runs for India in Tests but his record in odis is not going to affect this much compared to the five-day match
 lekin sahvaag par aankadon kaa koi asar nahin padataa or unka kahana he ki team kii safalataa ke liye unka yogadan hi myne rakhata he
 He said, 'I am happy with my performance in ODI cricket
 aisa isaliye he kyonki har koi is bare main baat kar rahaa he ki meraa test ausat 54 kaa he jabaki vanade kaa ausat sirf 35 he lekin isse meraa pradarshan kharaab nahin dikhataa
 Sehwag said, "yes, i can do better than what i have done but i am happy
" main vanade cricket main lagaataar acha pradarshan karne par dhyaan laga rahaa hum
 But as long as i contribute for the team, i am happy
 ’yah poochne par ki kya vah kandhe kii chot se puri tarah ubar gayi hai to unhone kaha, ‘main niyamit upachaar le rahaa hum or ummid he ki main puri tarah se thik ho jaaunga
 Despite his shoulder injury concerns, he said he would bowl in the World Cup but would do so only after he was fully fit
 unhone kaha, ‘nishchit rup se main gendbaaji karnaa chahta hum
 i want to contribute for Team India

 Huh
 chunaav ayog ne akhilesh ke paksh main faisla suna diya he
 From now on the cycle and SP will run on Akhilesh's behest
 chunaav ayog kaa faisla aate hi ek ore jahaan akhilesh kheme main khushi kii lahar daud gai to duusari ore mulaayam khemaa maayoos najar aayaa
 Soon after the verdict, Akhilesh Yadav went to meet his father Mulayam and took his blessings
 akhilesh jaanate the ki unka paksh majboot he shaayad yahi vajah thi ki sulah kii sari koshishen naakaafi sabit huin
 Now Mulayam and Shivpal have few options left
 aaie daalate hai ek najar
 
 
 Speaking of Akhilesh, the first option is to accept the decision of the Election Commission and bless his son Akhilesh Yadav as the party's national president
 iske alaava apatkaaleen rashtriya adhiveshan main die gaye nae pad 'party sangrakshak' kii jimmedaari sanbhaalein
 This will strengthen the party and their political importance will also remain intact
 court ja sakate hai mulaayamchunaav chihn cycle par apana daawa pesh karne kaa abhi ek vikalp netaji ke paas bachaa hua he
 If they wish, they can challenge the decision of the Election Commission in the court
 lekin, mangalvaar se pehle charan kii notification jari ho rahi he aise main mulaayam ko isse koi fori raahat nahin milegi alabatta yah jarur ho saktaa he ki cycle fries ho jaae
 However, both sides had said that whatever decision of the Election Commission will come will be valid
 nai party ke liye kerani hogi pahamgar mulaayam ko apane kheme ke saath chunavi maidan main utarana he to mulaayam ko ab nai party or chunaav chihn ke liye chunaav ayog main guhaar lagaani hogi
 If the Mulayam camp forms a new party, it will hurt both the parties in the assembly elections
 kendriya raajnneeti main jaaen shivpalaspa ke purv pradesh adhyaksh or akhilesh yadav ke chachaa shivpal yadav ab kendriya raajnneeti main ja sakate hai
 Akhilesh Yadav has previously removed him from the Cabinet cabinet and the post of state president in the national convention
 ab unke paas aakhri vikalp ke taur par kendriya raajnneeti hi he
 After the decision of the Election Commission, Mulayam and Shivpal have left the way of handing over succession to the younger generation as the last option
 mulaayam ko akhilesh pehle hi party kaa sangrakshak bana chuke hai ab shivpal yadav ko bhi apni paramparaagat seat jaswantnagar seat se apane bete aditya yadav ko chunaav ladvana chahie

 Bad banks increase 7
 34 lakh karod tak pahunch chukaa he
 The United Forum of Bank Unions (UFBU), representing one million bankers, is alleged to be under heavy political pressure from bank officials to achieve the scheme's goals
 bataa den ki mudra yojana april 2015 main shuru kii gai thi
 Under this, there is a provision to give loans of up to 10 lakh rupees without collateral security
 mudra yojana ekarifinancing yojanahai jisamen sarkaar se sidhe lone kii jarurat nahin hoti
 The loans are borrowed from public sector banks, NBFC (non-banking finance companies), MFI (micro financial institutions)
 endie ke teen saal se zyada ke shashan main kareeb 5 lakh karod rupye ke mudra lone baante gaye
 Most of this went to nationalized banks
 karj waapas naa karne vaale corporates or badhate ja rahe NPA (non parforming esets) se bankers pehle se hi mushkil halaat main hai

e
 bad loans, while the audit of the banks shows that on many occasions even the primary security parameters were not used for such loans
 bank of india ke manager pankaj kapur ne kaha, ‘kai baar hamen target puraa karne ke liye ek hi din main paanch mudra lone baantne ke liye kaha jaataa he
 It is common for the loan to be used for other purposes than the work it is given
 masalan lone kaarobaar ke liye liya jaataa he lekin uskaa istemaal shaadi-byaah, makaan banane or anya gharelu jaruraton ko puraa karne ke liye kiya gaya
 If they do not have the money to repay the loan, then the banker is held responsible and punished
 bank unions kaa aarope he ki sarkaar mudra yojana kaa istemaal raajnneetik milage lene ke liye kar rahi he
 According to union leaders, complaints have been received from branch managers that mps, mlas and local politicians use threatening, abusive words for bank officials

 artiai kanoon ke tahat ab ve sabhi gaiyr sarkari sanghathan or santhaan aate hai jinhen sarkaar pratyaksh yaa paroksh rup se moti aarthik madad karti he
 This arrangement is given in the judgment of the Supreme Court which came on 17 September
 isamen supreme court ne spasht rup se kaha he ki moti aarthik madad se aashay 50 fisadi se nahin he or isamen koi niyam nahin tay kiya ja saktaa
 For example, if a hospital, educational institution is given free or heavy concession in the city, then it will be called a hefty financial aid
 artiai ke daayre main aane vaale santhaan public athurity kehlaayenge
 The court explained in more detail that the scale of assistance to the NGO or institution will be according to the facts of each case
 aise kai maamle ho sakate hai jahaan aarthik madad 50 fisadi kii zyada ho lekin unhen moti madad nahin kaha ja saktaa
 Imagine an NGO has a capital of Rs 10,000
 he or use 5000 ru
 If you get a gratis, it will not be called a fat contribution
 par agar koi enjio yaa santhaan karodon rupye kii grat letaa he or vah 50 fisadi se kam bhi ho to use moti aarthik madad kaha jayega
 After this decision, ngos, hospitals, educational institutions, etc
, who seek grants or subsidized land from the government or in any other way, will come under RTI
 lekin visheshgy kehete hai ki faisle ko sakhti se lagu karne kii vyavastha jab tak nahin kii jaaegi enjio or santhaan isse bachate rahenge
 Renowned RTI activist Subhash Aggarwal says that the Central Information Commission has also been giving such decisions before
 lekin sansthaanon kaa ravaiya latakaane vaala rahata he
 They bring a stay from the High Court against the cic's decision
 is faisle ke sambandh main agarwal kehete hai, agar koi enjio sarkari sahaayta nahin le rahaa he to wo itii ke daayre main nahin aayega
 Aggarwal advises that this decision will have an impact if the government makes the condition of coming under the purview of RTI mandatory in grant or help
 ve ek or salaah dete hai ki jitne bhi centre or rajya sarkaar ke bhawan vibhaag hai ve aise bhawanon or sansthaanon kii suchi bana len jinhen jameen riyaayat par di gai he or unase soochna kaa adhikaar lagu karne ko kahen anyathaa unka alotment radd kar den

 That's why astronauts go on a space mission to learn these secrets
 lekin itane bade antariksh main estronaut jate kahaan he? aksar ye sawaal hamaare andar uthta he
 The answer to this question is the International Space Station (ISS), which is specially designed keeping in mind the facilities of humans
 jaaniye spes main kaise sote, khate or bathroom jate hai estronautakya he antariksh stesan?antariksh stesan ko orbital stesan ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 It has been designed keeping in mind all the facilities for human living
 duusare shabdon main kaha ja saktaa he ki yah antariksh main maanav nirmit aisa stesan he, jisase prithvi se koi antariksh yaan jaakar mil saktaa he
 This station is like a platform
 jahaan se prithvi kaa surveykshan kiya ja saktaa he, akaash ke rahasy maaloom kiye ja sakate hai
 How this space center was built in 1998, the construction of the International Space Station began
 pehle ise sirf 15 saal ke liye antariksh main rakhane kii baat thi lekin ek qaraar ke baad iskaa istemaal 2020 tak kiya jayega
 In 2003, the shuttle vehicle became a victim of the Columbia accident after which NASA decided to leave the ISS empty but later it was decided to keep astronauts at the station at all times
 jaaniye international spes stesan (ISS) ke bare main rochak tathy1
 There are 16 countries involved in making this space station, America, Russia, Canada, Japan, Belgium, Brazil, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and UK
 2
 65 mph on the highway on earth may have a standard speed , but on the orbit the ISS runs at a speed of five miles per second
 iskaa matlab he ki yah stesan har 90 minute main grah kaa ek chakkar laga letaa he
 3
 spes stesan 357 feet main bana hua he, jo ek footbal ke maidan se bhi bada he
 4
 iskaa vajan 420,000 kilogram he
 This is equivalent to the weight of 320 cars
 5
 This station, built to explore the mysteries of space, has taken nearly $ 120 billion
 6
 The entire station has just two bathrooms
 antariksh yatriyon or prayogshaala ke jaanwaron kaa urine filter hokar phir se stesan ke driking water supplai main chalaa jaataa he, jisase antariksh yatriyon ko kabhi pani kii kami naa jhelni pade
 7
 ISS main oxigen ELECTROLYSIS kii prakriya ke jariye aati he
 8
 ISS ke electric system main 8 mile kaa taar he
 It is also larger than the perimeter of New York's Central Park
 9
 You are in space does not mean that virus cannot come in your computer
 stesan ke 52 computer main ek se zyada baar virus atake ho chukaa he
 10
 antariksh yatri din main teen baar khaanaa khate hai
 But they do not sit and eat
 wo bas khud ko sthir kar ke hawa main tairte rahete hai
 11
 spes centre raat ke samay akaash main chandramaa or shukr ke baad teesraa sabase chamakdaar he
 If your eyes are sharp, then you will see it in the sky like a fast moving plane
 12
 Anytime in space, when a astronaut steps out of the spacecraft, it is called a space walk

 How pleasant it is to be in a healthy relationship, only those who are in a romantic and sensible relationship can know themselves
 par yahi rishta us samay boj ban jaataa he jab isamen kadavaahat aa jaae
 Many times the newness of relationships is lost, due to which differences between two people also occur
 kai laag maanate hai ki koi bhi rishta ek samay ke baad boring ho hi jaataa he or usamen kuch bhi aisa nahin rah jaataa he jo romaanchak ho
 By the way, most people who think like this are the same who are single
 par agar aapako lagata he ki ab aapke rishte main kuch bhi nayaapan nahin rah gaya he or aap har roj ek hi jindagi ji-jikar bor ho chuke hai to in upayon ko aajamaa sakate hai

 You can play with your partner
 paagalpan or masti kii sari simaaen todakar ek alag jindagi jeene kaa ehsaas kar sakate hai
 By doing this, both of you will get a break which will definitely bring newness in your relationship
 2
 Cooking together is also a very good idea
 saath main khadey hokar khaanaa banane se jahaan aap donon ko ek-duusare ke saath vakt bitaane kaa mauka mil jayega vahiin kisi ek ko hi sari mehnat bhi nahin kerani padegi
 Cooking together brings two people closer
 3
 Lovely touch matters a lot in a relationship
 achaanak se jaakar apane partner kaa haath pakad lijie or use ye ehsaas karaie ki uskaa hona kitna jaruri he
 Believe that doing so will strengthen your relationship
 4
 Traveling and partying with friends also serves to give a new freshness to the relationship
 aap chahen to apane partner ke doston ke saath milakar apane saathi ke liye sarprise party plan kar sakate hai
 Doing this will prove to be very beneficial for your relationship
 5
 Trying to learn something new by sitting together also serves to strengthen the relationship

 You will be stunned to hear what happened to the child of a farmer from Haryana
 pehle to uskaa haath thressure main ek jatke se kandhe ke paas se cat kar alag ho gaya
 But with his father's prudence and doctors' efforts, he joined hands again
 ek angreji akhbaar ne yah khabar di he
 According to him, the son of a farmer was standing near Thrasher in village Gudana in Bhiwani district of Haryana and suddenly he put his hand in it
 jab tak koi kuch samaj paata, uskaa haath kandhe ke paas se alag ho gaya
 When his father saw this, without wasting time, he took the child and his severed hand with a motorcycle to the hospital
 aspataal main doctoron ne us haath ko ispac main daalkar use gudgaanv ke medanta aspataal le jane ko kaha
 The farmer reached there with a child and a hand
 doctoron ne bina vakt barbaad kiye uske haath ko phir se sharir main jodne kaa kathin kaam shuru kiya
 Till now no such operation has been done in the history of medical science
 doctoron ne vahaan uski 10 ghante tak surgery kii, yah ek bahut kathin oparation tha kyonki bachche kii patali-patali nason ko phir se joda gaya
 The hospital's senior consultant doctor Sanjay Mahendru, who is also a plastic surgeon, told that there is no history of such operation in the world
 iske liye aspataal main do timen banaai gayi
 One team was preparing the child while the other team was preparing to clean the hands and open the veins

 uttar pradesh ke mujffarnagar jile main chhedchhad kaa virodh karnaa ek mahila ko baari pad gaya gaya
 Five young men beat up a woman in the train
 mahila ko gambhir chotein ai hai
 The case is about dehradun-bandra Express train coming from Saharanpur towards Muzaffarnagar
 darasal, ek 23 varshiyamahilasaaranpur stesan se mujffarnagar jane ke liye dehradun-bandra express train main savaar hui thi
 It is alleged that shortly after boarding the train, five young men present in the coach started harassing the woman
 jiarapy ke ek esai ne bataaya ki mahila kuch der bardaasht karti rahi
 But before coming to Muzaffarnagar, he started opposing the youths
 yuvakon ko mahila kii yah baat nagavar gujri or unhone mahila ko chalati train main hipitnashuru kar diya
 While other passengers kept watching the spectacle
 mujffarnagar railway stesan aate hi yuvak us coach se faraar ho gaye
 The woman went to the GRP post located on the platform and told the whole incident

 While implementing GST from July 1 across the country, the central government claimed that the biggest benefit to companies would be after implementing it
 deshbhar main utpaadan karne vaali companiyon ko apni maal dhulaai kii lagaat ko jiesti vyavastha main 20 fisadi kam karne kaa mauka milegaa
 But companies do not see any benefit in the fourth month of GST implementation
 gauratlab he ki road transport mantri nitin gadakari ne daawa kiya tha ki transport sector ko jiesti se hone vaale phaayde kaa andaja is ek baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki jiesti lagu hone ke baad inter state check post kii tex vibhaag ko jarurat nahin he
 Because dozens of states sales tax on goods laden trucks will be included in GST
 lihaaja kisi factory main maal banakar taar hoga, usee samay trek par ladaai ke vakt hi uski yatra kaa jiesti paper taiyaar ho jayega jise yatra ke dauraan check yaa apadet karaane kii jarurat nahin padegi
 The reason is that no one knew how many truckloads of factory-laden trucks would stop at India from one state to another and from one city to another
 jiesti se yah badal jayega
 In any corner of the country, if the truck loaded with the goods from the factory reached the other corner without interruption, then the benefit of GST will be given to each of the goods on the truck - a reduction in the cost of transporting the goods from the factory to the market
 transport sector se judi companiyon kaa daawa he ki rajyon dwaara check post hataane kaa phayda unhen mahaj july ke shuruaati dinon main dikhaai diya
 But before it would benefit them, the mobile squads of the Sales Tax departments in most states started a new process of checking the papers by stopping the vehicles at various places
 ise bhi padhein: jiesti se khatm hoga number-2 kaa bijnesah gadakarigiasti lagu karne se pehle kendriya mantri ne yah bhi daleel di thi ki jahaan america main ek trek saal bhar main 3 lakh kilometre kaa safar tay karata he vahiin iske ulat bharat main ek trek mahaj 50 se 60 hajaar kilometre kii yatra prati varsh kar paata he
 On the other hand, before the introduction of GST per day, where a truck traveled in India for about 250-300 km a day, the US had 450 km and the global average was 800 km
 ab desh main jiesti lagu hone ke baad prati din mahaj 40-50 kilometre kaa ijapha hua he
 But this increase did not bring any benefit to the companies because the increase in crude oil prices in the global market during this time has increased the expenses of the companies
 ise bhi padhein: mukhyamantriyon ko teen saal main kamjor kar majboot hue pradhanmantri modijiasti lagu hone ke baad aisa hone se desh main maal se laden trek ke travel time main badi katautee dekhne ko milegi
 At the same time, online registration of goods worth more than Rs 50,000 under the proposed e-bill system under GST will reduce the time taken by trucks at present
 vahiin transport sector main in badlaavon ke saath deshbhar sudharti hive sthiti se desh main bade container trek kii maang bhi badhegi jisase kam se kam samay main zyada se zyada utpaada bazaar tak pahunch sakegaa
 Another major benefit of single GST across the country in place of multiple phase VAT will be in logistics that companies will no longer need to have specialized warehouses in different states
 pehle alag-alag rajyon main tex dar alag rahane ke kaaran companiyon ko vishesh warehouse har rajya main bananaa padataa tha
 Now after the implementation of GST, there will be no such obligation on companies
 gauratlab he ki bharat main manuphaccharing kshetra main jiesti se pehle logistic cost 14 fisadi thi
 Whereas in the important countries of the world, this cost is just 6-8%
 kendra sarkaar ko ummid he ki jiesti ke chalate ab bharat main bhi logistic cost ghatakar 10-12 fisadi ke daayre main aa jaaegi jisase na sirf companiyaan utpaada ko kam daam par bech sakengi balki apane munaafe ko bhi badha sakengi

 kya aapane kabhi sochaa he ki kyon sabaki shaadi or shaadishuda jindagi ek si kyon nahin hoti
 The reason for this is the different position of Jupiter in the horoscope
 to aaie sabase pehle jaanate hai ki mahilaon ke vivaah or vaivaahik jivan ko kaise prabhavit karata he brihaspati
 
 
 
 mahilaon ke vivaah ko brihaspati kaise prabhavit karata he?- bina brihaspati ke mahilaon kaa na to vivaah hoga or na hi chalegaa- brihaspati kamjor ho to vivaah main bahut deree hoti he- brihaspati karaab ho to vaivaahik jivan main ksht sahanaa padataa he- brihaspati dooshit ho to mahilaon ke charitra ko kamjor bana detaa he- brihaspati jaraa bhi thik ho to vivaah or vaivaahik jivan ko thik rakhata hedgar aapaki kundali kaa brihaspati aapaki shaadi yaa shaadishuda jindagi main baadha daal rahaa he to jyotish ke jaankaron ke mutabik chote se upaay se aap apni kundali main brihaspati kii sthiti majboot kar sakati hai
 So let's know the ways of women to strengthen the horoscope of women
 
 
 brihaspati ko kaise majboot karen mahilaayein?- roj subah surya ko haldi milakar jal arpit karen- vishnu sahastranam kaa paath karen or satvik aahaar grahan karen-hafte main ek baar dharm sthaan par jarur jaaenmahilaon kii kundali ke bare main to aapane jaan liya
 
 
 
 ab ham aapako bataaenge ki purushon kii shaadi ko kaise prabhavit karata he brihaspati 
 
 
 
 
 
 purushon ke vivaah ko brihaspati kaise prabhavit karata he ?- aamtaur par purushon kaa vivaah shukr par nirbhar karata he- lekin patni ke bare main sari jaankaree brihaspati se hi milti he- patni kaa rang ,rup, swabhaav or talmail brihaspati se jaan sakate hai- brihaspati kamjor yaa madhyam ho to saadhaaran patni milti he- brihaspati karaab yaa dooshit ho to updravi patni milti he- majboot brihaspati ho to patni acchhee magar niyantran karne vaali hoti haveren brihaspati ko majboot karne ke upaaykyonki kamjor brihaspati karaab kar saktaa he aapaki shaadishuda jindagi
 
 
 
 jyotish ke jaankaron kii maane to jis purush kii kundali main brihaspati kii sthiti kamjor hoti he use achche rang-rup or swabhaav vaali patni nahin mil sakati
 
 
 
 to aaie jaanate hai purushon kii kundali ke brihaspati ko majboot karne ke upaay
 
 
 How to strengthen Jupiter men? - Make a habit of getting up early in the morning - chant "namah Shivaay" 108 times daily morning and evening - Take satvik diet and plant fruit trees - Do not wear garland without reason around your neck
 In the morning or evening, wear yellow cloth and sit in the place of worship, then offer a garland of red and yellow flowers to Jupiter Dev, then to some yellow and sweet dish
 Offer Bhog and sit there and chant Jupiter's mantra "grand Green Grains: Gurve Nam:" Chant then offer turmeric mixed water to the root of banana tree and also offer jaggery and gram and pray to Jupiter Dev for the desired marriage
 Till, you will surely get tamilnadu kii divangat mukhyamantri jayalalita ke nidhan ke baad unki party andar hi andar kai dhadon main bant gai he
 a similar situation arose after the death of his political mentor MG Ramachandran and Jayalalithaa himself led the new faction
 aaj jayalalita kii vishwasi shashikala ke netritv main bhi party usee muhane par khadi he
 There was no confirmation of Amma's death even before the death broke out, but the party continued to be uprooted
 somvaar ko chennai dinabhar siyaasi sargharmiyon main duba rahaa
 Sasikala kept meeting all day with the strong AIADMK leaders
 ek report ke mutabik somvaar kii dopaher shashikala ne party ke sabhi vidhayakon or mantriyon kii meeting bulaai lekin isamen mukhyamantri paneerselvam samet paanch diggaj mantri nahin pahunche
 The controversy arose from here
 haalanki ye sabhi raat 11 baje is meeting main pahunche jahaan se 30 vidhayakon ko sidhe rajbhavan le jaaya gaya or rajyapal ke saamne aupchaariktaayen puri kii gayi
 11
 30 baje jayalalita ke nidhan kii khabar ai or raat 1
 Panneerselvam was sworn in as Chief Minister at 30 pm
 tufaan se pehle kii khamoshipanch baar kii mukhyamantri je jayalalita ke nidhan se upje raajnneetik nirvaat se jujh rahi annadramuk party ne paneerselvam ko mukhyamantri bana kar party ke bheetar ke kolahal ko kuch samay ke liye jarur shant kar liya he lekin yah tufaan se pehle kii khamoshi ho sakati he
 In front of j Jayalalithaa's stature, never a single leader in the party was seen sitting on the number two chair
 haalanki jab jab ammaa ko mukhyamantri pad se kuch kaarnon se hatana padaa tab tab wo paneerselvam ko hi is kursi par bithaati raheen
 Sasikala is the biggest name after Amma, even though Panneerselvam has become the Chief Minister in the absence of Amma, but Sasikala, who is called the shadow of Jayalalithaa, is now the tallest within the party
 shashikala natarajan kabhi kisi sarkari yaa party pad par nahin raheen lekin unhone 1980 se lagaataar jayalalita ke saathi ke rup main paroksh rup main satta kaa sanchaalan kiya he
 She comes from the same community as Chief Minister Panneerselvam who was believed to be Jayalalithaa's right hand
 kul milakar jayalalita ke jane ke baad ab 59 varshiya shashikala hi tamilnadu main anna dramuk party ke shaktisantulan kii dhuree maani ja rahi hai or saath hi aane vaale vakt main wo hi tay karengi ki vahaan kii satta kiske haath main rahegi
 With the death of returned Sasikala's husband Natarajanjayalalitha, Sasikala's husband has also returned to his residence at Poise Garden
 jis em natarajan ke saath hi unke 13 anya parijanon ko jayalalita ne khud unke yahaan ghusane par pabandi lagaai thi unki vahaan vaapasi se kayaason ke bazaar or bhi garm ho gaye
 Sasikala's husband was a PRO in the government and he introduced his wife to Jayalalithaa
 kya he jayalalita kaa shashikala conection?1980 main hue is parichay ke baad se shashikala jayalalita kii behad kareebi ban gai thim lekin 2011 main unke parivaar ko jayalalita ne na keval is awaas se nikaala balki party se bhi nishkashit kar diya tha
 Also, Sasikala's husband was sent away from politics by the Jayalalitha government in 2012
 haalanki march 2012 main shashikala ke likhit maafeename or parivaar se puri tarah se dur rahane kii shart par jayalalita ne unhen waapas bula liya
 After her death, Sasikala's husband, who had been sitting silent for the last five years, seems to be returning to active politics again
 tamil raajnneeti par hoga mannargudi mafia kaa kabza?poes garden main keval shashikala ke pati hi nahin balki unke bhai diwaharan, nanad je ilavarasi, bete vivek, bahan priya, bhattije venkatesh or mahadevan or bhatiji ke pati sivakumar kii bhi vaapasi ho gai he
 Those who know Sasikala believe that her political thinking goes according to her husband
 iske saath hi pehle se hi behad majboot mannargudi samudaay ek baar phir tamilnadu kii raajnneeti main haaavee hone vaala he
 Senior leaders started speculating about this with Jayalalithaa being admitted to Apollo Hospital
 natarajan kii yojana sabhi ko yah bataane kii he ki ammaa shashikala ko uttaradhikari bananaa chaahati thim or iske saath hi wo unki viraasat par ekadhikaar karnaa chaahate hai
 However, a senior party leader says that this is not going to happen
 gatividhiyon par diemke, bijepi kii nazaris bich, shashikala or unke virdohi camp ke bich than gai he jo mannargudi mafia ko aasaani se gaddi par nahin baithne degi
 Various factions of Anna DMK are the ones claiming it
 jaankaron kaa kahana he ki yahi vajah he ki anna dramuk ek baar phir do faad hone kii raah par he
 Now that the ruling party is on the verge of partition, the opposition DMK and BJP are eyeing their activities
 paneerselvam kaa kya he game plan?in sab ke bich mukhyamantri paneerselvam kaa game plan kya he ye dekhne vaali baat hogi
 When MGR died in 1987, his party split into two factions
