 congress mahasachiv, purv mantri or mumbai se saansad gurdas kaamat ne narendra modi ko haivaan qaraar dete hue kaha ki vah mandir todate hai, banavaate nahin
 Kamat was addressing Congress workers at the Science Center in Surat on Tuesday
 unhone kaha ki modi kii nafrat kii raajnneeti nahin chalane vaali
 According to Kamat, Narendra Modi lies
 vah kedarnath mandir ko phir se banavaane kii baat karte hai, magar sachai yah he ki unhone ahmedabad or gandhi nagar main teen sau se bhi zyada mandir tudwa die
 Accusing Modi of doing politics of hate, Kamat said that the Hindus of the country will never forgive Modi for what happened after the Godhra carnage
 kaamat ne kaha ki desh hi nahin modi ne party or apane gathbandhan main bhi vibhaajan kar diya
 Due to them, JDU split and BJP has also split
 modi ke karishme par tippanee karte hue kaamat bole ki bijepi bhale hi unka naam har jagah uchhaale, magar sach yahi he ki gujarat ke baahar modi kaa koi asar nahin he

 You have rarely heard that the 'prime Minister' has gone to feed the goat and the 'president' is giving water to the fields
 lekin aaj ham jis gaanv kii baat karne ja rahe hai, vahaan aisa hi kuch hota he
 Let me tell you, in addition to the Prime Minister and the President in this Ramnagar village falling in Bundi district of Rajasthan, the Governor plays marbles, and the collectors clash for a broken gun
 lekin ye sab yahaan kyon or kaise hota he, yah jaanane ke baad aap ek baar hairat main jarur pad jaaenge
 According to media reports, Ramnagar village, with a population of about 500, is mostly inhabited by Kanjar and Mongia communities
 is gaanv main log apane bacchon ke naam sarkari padon, sansthaaon or hastiyon ke naam par rakhte hai
 These names include strange names like Governor, President, Prime Minister, Samsung, Android, SIM card, Chip, Gionee, missed call, and High Court
 media main ai report kii maane to is gaanv main zyaadaatar log anpadh hai or inke bich ye naam kaaphi prachlit hai
 Here a 50-year-old man is named collector, but it is different that the collector has not seen the face of the school till date
 yahaan ke log adhikariyon kii padon se prabhavit hokar aksar apane bacchon ke naam aiji, espi, hawaldaar or magistrate rakh lete hai
 The story behind this strange custom is no less unique
 bataaya jaataa he ki takreeban 50 saal pehle tatkaaleen jila-colector gaanv kaa muyna karne aae
 An old lady of the village was so impressed by her status that she started calling her grandson by the name of Collector
 bas phir kya tha! tabhi se in logon ne apane bacchon ko is tarah ke naam dene kii reet bana lee
 However, it is another matter that this 50 year old collector never went to school
 tippaniyan Even a person named High Court lives in this village
 kehete hai ki jab uskaa janm hua to uske dada ko hoicourt ne ek maamle main jamaanat di thi
 What was it then, that child was named High Court
 yahi nahin, gaanv ke ek parivaar ko congress se khaasaa lagaav he
 It is evident that the children of that house have been named Sonia, Rahul and Priyanka
 ramnagar kii tarah bundi ke hi ek duusare gaanv nainva main bhi bacchon ko ajeebogareeb naam die jate hai
 The only difference is that people here are convinced of advanced techniques rather than administration
 yahaan rahane vaale mongiya or banjaaraa samudaay ke logon ne apane bacchon ke naam mobile brands or essessories par rakhe hai
 This is the reason that here the SIM card can be seen swinging from the trees and the miss-call is often broken by handcuffs for slingshot
 media report ke anusaar kareeb 500 aabaadi vaale ramnagar gaanv main zyaadaatar kanjar or mongia samudaay ke log rahete hai
 In this village, people name their children after government posts, institutions and celebrities
 in naamon main rajyapal, raashtrapati, pradhanmantri, semsung, andrid, sim card, chip, jioni, missd kol, or hai court jaise ajeebogareeb naam shaamil hai
 According to the media report, most people in this village are illiterate and these names are very popular among them
 yahaan par 50 saal ke ek vyakti kaa naam colector he, lekin yah baat alag he ki colector ne aaj tak skool kaa cheharaa tak nahin dekha he
 People here, after being influenced by the posts of officers, often name their children IG, SP, Havildar and Magistrate
 is ajeeb rivaaj ke peeche judi kahani bhi kam anuthi nahin he
 It is said that about 50 years ago, the then District Collector came to inspect the village
 unke rutabe se gaanv kii ek vruddh mahila itani prabhavit hui ki vah apane pote ko colector naam se hi bulaane lagi
 What was there! Since then, these people have made a practice of giving such names to their children
 haalanki yah baat or he ki 50 saal kaa yah colector kabhi skool nahin gaya
 The comments yahaan tak ki is gaanv main hoicourt naam kaa bhi ek vyakti rahata he
 It is said that when he was born, his grandfather was granted bail in a case by the High Court
 bas phir kya tha, us bachche kaa naam hoicourt rakh diya gaya
 Not only this, a family in the village has a great affection for the Congress
 jaahir he ki us ghar ke bacchon ke naam sonia, rahul or priyanka rakhe gaye hai
 Like Ramnagar, in another village Nainwa of Bundi, children are given strange names
 fark sirf itnaa he ki yahaan ke log prashasan kii bajaay unnat takneekon ke kaayal hai
 The people of Maungia and Banjara community living here have named their children on mobile brands and accessories
 yahi kaaran hai ki yahaan sim card ko pedo se jhulate or miss-kol ko aksar haathon main gulel liye imaliyaan todate dekha ja saktaa he

 The story behind this strange custom is no less unique
 bataaya jaataa he ki takreeban 50 saal pehle tatkaaleen jila-colector gaanv kaa muyna karne aae
 An old lady of the village was so impressed by her status that she started calling her grandson by the name of Collector
 bas phir kya tha! tabhi se in logon ne apane bacchon ko is tarah ke naam dene kii reet bana lee
 However, it is another matter that this 50 year old collector never went to school
 tippaniyan Even a person named High Court lives in this village
 kehete hai ki jab uskaa janm hua to uske dada ko hoicourt ne ek maamle main jamaanat di thi
 What was it then, that child was named High Court
 yahi nahin, gaanv ke ek parivaar ko congress se khaasaa lagaav he
 It is evident that the children of that house have been named Sonia, Rahul and Priyanka
 ramnagar kii tarah bundi ke hi ek duusare gaanv nainva main bhi bacchon ko ajeebogareeb naam die jate hai
 The only difference is that people here are convinced of advanced techniques rather than administration
 yahaan rahane vaale mongiya or banjaaraa samudaay ke logon ne apane bacchon ke naam mobile brands or essessories par rakhe hai
 This is the reason that here the SIM card can be seen swinging from the trees and the miss-call is often broken by handcuffs for slingshot
 yahaan tak ki is gaanv main hoicourt naam kaa bhi ek vyakti rahata he

 Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal is preparing to contest in Haryana
 march 2018 main kejariwal hisar main ek badi raily karne ja rahe hai
 Here he will crack the trumpet for the upcoming election
 party ne haryana main dilli ke kaamkaaj ko ginaakar vot maangane kaa plan bhi banaaya he
 Arvind Kejriwal has appealed to the Agrawal Samaj of Haryana and its businessmen to prepare for the Haryana elections
 kejariwal ne kaha ki haryana main sabhi logon kii duty lagaataa hum
 The next election is to contest Haryana and to flag the Aam Aadmi Party flag
 jaahir he dilli main satta hone ke baavjood 2017 main emsidi chunaav main asafal hui 'aap' ne 2018 main ek bada elaan kiya he
 The Aam Aadmi Party is soon going to hold a big meeting of a team of 200 people, besides the Lok Sabha, Assembly and District President, to find political ground in Haryana
 ye team haryana main chunaav se pehle arvind kejariwal kii raily or prachaar kii ranneeti taiyaar karegi
 Earlier, AAP participated in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections in Haryana but the 10 Lok Sabha seats were not successful
 'haryana kii charmara chuki he kanoon vyavastham aadmi party ke rajyasabha saansad susheel gupta ne 'ajtak' se baatcheet karte hue kaha ki vaisya or agarwal samaaj kii jaden haryana ke andar hai
 Law and order within Haryana has broken down
 lagaataar balaatkaar ke maamle bad rahe hai lekin vahaan mukhyamantri suraksha muhaiyaa karaane main naakaam rahe hai
 The fascination of the people had shifted from the Congress, there was no miracle from BJP
 isliye ab vahaan log parivartan chaahate hai
 i am a resident of Haryana, if the party gives me any responsibility, then i will work more vigorously there
 hisar main badi raily karenge kejarivalgupta ne bataaya ki party dilli model ko haryana main aajamaayegi
 According to him, farmers in Haryana remain troubled
 jabaki dilli main fasal barbaad hoti he to sabase zyada muaavja kisaan ko diya jaataa he
 Kejriwal will now take this model of Delhi up to Haryana and will rally in Hisar on March 24-25
 bataa den ki dilli main satta sanbhaalane ke baad aam aadmi party ne punjab vidhansabha, goa vidhansabha, dilli emsidi or uttarapradesh ke nigam chunaav main haath aajamaaya tha lekin koi badi safalataa haath nahin lagi thi

 sutron ke mutabik, rakesh maaria 1981 batch ke adhikari hai, jabaki unki jagah jin ahamed javed komumbai police kamishnarbanaya gaya he vah 1980 batch ke adhikari hai
 This means that with the decision of the state government, now more names have been added to Maria in the race for ACB Chief, because now the number of 1980 batch Satish Mathur, Meeran Borwankar and Vijay Kamble also comes for the post of ACB Chief

 After the decision to grant special state status to Seemandhra, politics in Bihar has been hot
 bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne 1 march ko bihar band rakhane kii apil janata se kii he, to uske baad bijepi ne 28 farvari ko rail kaa chakkaa jam karne ke elaan main tanik deree nahin lagaai
 Both are angry about the attitude of the center
 simandhra ko ek din main vishesh rajya kaa darja mil gaya, jabaki bihar pichley kai saalon se kai staron par isaki koshish kar chukaa he, lekin koi sunwaayee nahin
 Nitish Kumar in particular has been continuously trying to get the status of special state to Bihar
 bijepi vishesh rajya ke liye to nahin, vishesh package kii baat karti rahi he
 But now he has also changed the tone by changing the political situation
 bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne kendra ke bhedbhaav vaale ravaie par gahari naaraazgi jaahir kii he
 Nitish Kumar said that the Center is arbitrarily granting special status to Seemandhra Pradesh in one day, while Bihar has been struggling for the status of special state for the last one and a half years, it is being ignored
 kendra kii isi manamaani ke khilaaf 1 march ko puure bihar ko band karne kaa elaan karte hue nitish kumaar ne kaha ki ab wo chup nahin baithenge
 To bring special status to Bihar, he launched a signature campaign of 1 crore 18 people
 patna or dilli main adhikaar reliyaan kii
 The Center formed the Raghuram Rajan Committee to review it
 haalanki wo cameti kii anushansa se sahamat nahin the, phir bhi bihar ko pichhadepan ke aadhaar par vishesh rajya kaa darja mili iske liye ve tatpar the
 But the Center put it on hold at the behest of its partners
 yahi nahin, vitt mantri pi chidambaram ne pichley saal ke bajet bhaashan or aarthik surveykshan main bihar ko vishesh rajya kaa darja dene kii charchaa kii thi
 The Finance Minister himself made the report of the Raghuram Rajan Committee public
 lekin 26 november, 2013 ko hone vaali vitt sachiv ke saath baithak ko achaanak radd kar diya gaya
 After that there was no discussion on granting special state status to Bihar
 duusari ore, simandhra ko sonia gandhi ke kehane par pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne ek din main vishesh rajya kaa darja de diya
 Bihar is backward, it will take 25 years to come up evenly despite the country's ratio moving rapidly
 aise main jab bihar vishesh rajya ke darje ko paane ke liye sabhi criteria puraa karata he, to ise vishesh rajya kaa darja kyon nahin? isi masale par virodh jataane ke liye bihar main 1 march ko kaamkaaj band rakhaa jayega
 Nitish Kumar appealed to the people of Bihar not to do any work on this day and should show their opposition to the center
 udhar, bihar ke mukhyamantri ke bihar band ke elaan ke thik baad bijepi ne bhi vishesh rajya ke mudde par bihar main 28 farvari ko rail chakkaa jam karne kaa elaan kar diya
 Although BJP has always demanded special package rather than special state issue, but now that Seemandhra is getting special state status and Nitish Kumar has already taken the issue, BJP has demand for special state There is no other way than to support
 bijepi nitish kumaar par yahi aarope laga rahi he ki jab vishesh rajya kaa darja kaa maamla bihar vidhanmandal ke donon sadanon se sabhi dalon ke samarthan se paas hua tha, to phir nitish kumaar ne is mudde ko keval jediu kaa kyon bana diya? bijepi ke varisht netaa or vidhanmandal main pratipaksh ke netaa susheel kumaar modi ne kendra kii bhedbhaav kii niti par naaraazgi jaahir karte hue kaha ki nitish kumaar isi congress ke bharose bihar ko vishesh rajya kaa darja dilaanaa chaah rahe hai
 He claimed that only the BJP can grant special state status to Bihar

 Currently, the hope of getting relief from traders in Delhi is becoming less
 mangalvaar ko supreme court ne ek bada kadam uthaate hue master plan 2020 sambhavit sanshodhan par roak laga di
 This amendment was a major attempt of the central government to provide relief to the traders facing the brunt of sealing in Delhi, which has now proved to be a complete failure after the court's decision
 supreme court ke is faisle ko lekar vyapaariyon main khaasi naaraazgi he, maayoos vyapaaree sarkaar phir chaahe vah dilli kii ho yaa centre kii usko kos rahe hai
 Immediately after the court stayed these amendments, the haemonitoring committee started the sealing process in Delhi, in this connection the team of the monitoring committee first reached the Amar Colony Market where it faced heavy opposition from the traders
 amar colony market main vyapaariyon ne bade paimaane par virodh kiya or isi silsile main lajpat nagar fliover ko bhi jam kar diya gaya
 The Lajpat Nagar flyover continued to be jammed for half an hour after which the Monitoring Committee asked for additional force which, if not found, the team had to return without sealing
 khan market association ke adhyaksh sanjeev mehara kaa kahana he ki yah galat he
 We welcome and respect the court order, but we will definitely keep our point before the court
 shuruyaat se hi hamaare saath aisa vyavhaar kiya ja rahaa he
 If the businessman incurs losses, then the progress of the state and the country will also be stopped

 ’’ New Delhi's New Ashok Nagar area has revealed a shocking friendship
 ram avatar naam ke shaks ke ek dost ne aapasi jhagade ke baad uskaa galaa ret diya
 Not only that, he locked the room in the room and ran away

 The next day, when neighbors heard the cry of Ram Avatar from inside the room, he broke the door and took it out
 padosiyon ne hi ram avatar ko paas ke laal bahadur shastri asptal main bhartee karaayaa
 Ram is fighting between life and death in Avatar Hospital right now

 The next day neighbors heard the cry of Ram Avatar from inside the room

 gujarat main narendra modi ne teesri baar jeet kaa sehara pahana he
 After 'india Shining', Indian democracy has proved once again that special media campaigns of any kind do not have any meaning for it
 gaur se dekha jaae to is jeet main bhavishya ke kai sanket chhipe hai
 In addition to 'modi Magic', many other factors have also worked in Gujarat, but the importance of the development issue and Modi's success in giving a corruption-free administration did not make it more difficult for people to make up their mind
 apni khud kii banaai mushkilon se juujhati mukhya vipakshi party congress mukaable ke har daur main surakshatmak tareeke se khelti najar ai

 ab jabaki gujarat main chunaav ho gaya he or modi gaddinshin ho gaye hai to vakt he is baat kii charchaa kaa ki modi kii is jeet se rashtriya raajnneeti par kya asar padegaa
 As earlier it was being speculated that this victory would open the way for Delhi to Modi
 
 
 ab shaayad is bahes ko or zyada bal milegaa
 
 
 Whether Modi will become bjp's prime ministerial candidate or not
 
 
 
 At a glance, it is a difficult task for Modi
 desh kii vartmaan raajnneeti upie ore endie ke hawaale he
 Modi's image against Muslims will pull the NDA constituents in the opposite direction
 lekin sawaal yah bhi he ki congress kii teji se giri chhavi or bhavishya ke netritv kii sahi paribhaasha garh paane main naakamayaabi ke chalate duusare dal uskaa kitna saath denge
 
 
 
 aise main ek ksheen sambhaavna tisare morche kii bhi banati he lekin chote raajnneetik dalon kii aapasi khinchataan ko dekhte hue isaki sambhaavna vastav main bahut 'ksheen' najar aati he
 
 
 
 to zyada sambhaavna isi baat kii najar aati he ki raajnneetik dalon kaa nayaa dhruvikaran ho or endie tathaa upie kii nai paribhaasha bane
 If this happens, then the path of Modi becoming Prime Minister may be 'slightly' easier
 
 
 kyonki uttar ke raajnneetik dalon kaa saath chhod dene par dakshin ke kuch dal endie se jud sakate hai
 Particularly those parties of the South for whom hindu-muslim politics does not matter
 duusare, yadi aisa na ho sakaa or bijepi alag-thalag padi to uski sambhaavna chunaav ke maidan main paaramparik raajnneetik saathiyon ke saath hi jane kii banati he
 And then the BJP may possibly decide to jump into the political arena with its old issues
 ni:andeh haalia haath laga vikaas kaa mudda bhi uske agenda main upar aa saktaa he
 However, there is no guarantee that the issue of development has gone on in Gujarat, then the rest of the country will also vote on this issue
 
 
 
 And it will also be an exaggeration to see the politics of the country from the prism of Gujarat politics
 
 
 to bhi yah sthiti narendra modi ke liye laabhprad hogi
 On the other hand, it is also being said that the internal infighting of the BJP could become a stonewall in Modi's way, but the victory in the Gujarat elections will only overwhelm his opponents within the party
 tippaniyan If everything remains the same and the public has not given any 'shocking' result then the circumstances may go in favor of Narendra Modi
 in sab sambhaavnaaon ko ek daayre main rakhkar yadi sochaa jaae to modi ke liye rasta sugam banataa he or saal 2014 kaa loksabhaa chunaav narendra modi banaam rahul gandhi ho saktaa he
 
 
 
 or yadi vah pradhanmantri banane main safal ho jate hai to desh kii raajnneeti kis karavat baithegi yah dekhne vaali baat hogi
 In addition to 'modi Magic', many other factors have also worked in Gujarat, but the importance of the development issue and Modi's success in giving a corruption-free administration did not make it more difficult for people to make up their mind

 aise main ek ksheen sambhaavna tisare morche kii bhi banati he lekin chote raajnneetik dalon kii aapasi khinchataan ko dekhte hue isaki sambhaavna vastav main bahut 'ksheen' najar aati he
 
 
 
 to zyada sambhaavna isi baat kii najar aati he ki raajnneetik dalon kaa nayaa dhruvikaran ho or endie tathaa upie kii nai paribhaasha bane
 If this happens, then the path of Modi becoming Prime Minister may be 'slightly' easier
 
 
 kyonki uttar ke raajnneetik dalon kaa saath chhod dene par dakshin ke kuch dal endie se jud sakate hai
 Particularly those parties of the South for whom hindu-muslim politics does not matter
 duusare, yadi aisa na ho sakaa or bijepi alag-thalag padi to uski sambhaavna chunaav ke maidan main paaramparik raajnneetik saathiyon ke saath hi jane kii banati he
 And then the BJP may possibly decide to jump into the political arena with its old issues

 However, there is no guarantee that the issue of development has gone on in Gujarat, then the rest of the country will also vote on this issue
 
 
 
 And it will also be an exaggeration to see the politics of the country from the prism of Gujarat politics
 
 
 to bhi yah sthiti narendra modi ke liye laabhprad hogi
 On the other hand, it is also being said that the internal infighting of the BJP could become a stonewall in Modi's way, but the victory in the Gujarat elections will only overwhelm his opponents within the party
 tippaniyan If everything remains the same and the public has not given any 'shocking' result then the circumstances may go in favor of Narendra Modi
 in sab sambhaavnaaon ko ek daayre main rakhkar yadi sochaa jaae to modi ke liye rasta sugam banataa he or saal 2014 kaa loksabhaa chunaav narendra modi banaam rahul gandhi ho saktaa he
 
 
 
 or yadi vah pradhanmantri banane main safal ho jate hai to desh kii raajnneeti kis karavat baithegi yah dekhne vaali baat hogi
 Struggling with its own setbacks, the main opposition party, the Congress, was seen playing a protective manner in every round of the contest
 keshubhai patel kii gujarat parivartan party sambhavat: sirf 'modi virodh' ke liye hi ladati najar ai
 Now that the elections have been held in Gujarat and Modi has become the incumbent, it is time to discuss how this victory of Modi will affect the national politics
 jaisaa ki pehle yah kayaas lagaaya ja rahaa tha ki is jeet se modi ke liye dilli ke raste khulenge
 
 
 Now perhaps this debate will get more strength
 
 
 ki modi bijepi ke pradhanmantri pad ke daavedaar banenge yaa nahin
 
 
 
 ek najar se dekhen to modi ke liye yah bada mushkil kaam he
 The current politics of the country is attributed to UPA and NDA
 musalamaanon ke khilaaf bani modi kii chhavi endie ke ghatak dalon ko vipareet disha main khinchegi
 But the question is also how much the other parties will support the Congress due to its fast-paced image and its inability to establish a true definition of future leadership
 
 
 
 In such a situation, a weak possibility is also formed of the Third Front, but in view of the mutual pull of small political parties, the possibility of this seems really very 'weak'
 
 
 
 So it seems more likely that political parties should be polarized and new definitions of NDA and UPA should be made
 yadi aisa hua to modi ke pradhanmantri banane kii raah 'thodi' aasaan ho sakati he
 
 
 Because if left with the political parties of the north, some parties of the south can join the NDA
 khaskar dakshin ke ve dal jinke liye hindu-muslim raajnneeti koi khaas mahatv nahin rakhti
 Secondly, if this does not happen and the BJP falls apart, then it is likely to go with the traditional political allies in the election arena
 or tab bijepi sambhavat: apane puraane muddon ke saath raajnneetik akhaade main kudane kaa man bana sakati he
 Of course, the issue of development may also come up on its agenda

 duusari ore, yah bhi kaha ja rahaa he ki bijepi kii andruni khinchataan modi ke raste main pathar ban sakati he lekin gujarat chunaavon main mili jeet se party ke bheetar unke virodhiyon ke hausale post hi honge
 The comments yadi sab kuch aise hi rahaa or janata ne koi 'chaunkaane' vaala parinaam nahin diya to paristhitiyaan narendra modi ke paksh main ja sakati hai
 If all these possibilities are kept within a scope, then the thought becomes easier for Modi and the 2014 Lok Sabha elections can be Narendra Modi vs Rahul Gandhi

 After this, the three were rushed to the hospital, where doctors declared them dead
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki tanks main jahrili gas kaa dabaav itnaa zyada tha ki raahat or bachaav kaary main bhi dikkat ai
 According to the police, 62-year-old Lavkush, the owner of the factory, his 35-year-old son Praveen entered the tank on Sunday morning, but both fell unconscious and were trapped in the tank due to excess of gasses inside the tank
 vahiin, pados main rahane vaale hriday narayan ko pehle se pataa tha ki luvkush or unka betaa tanks saaf karne vaale hai
 When they saw that no one came out, they made a voice standing outside the tank
 haalanki jab andar se koi jawaab nahin aayaa to hriday narayan bhi tanks ke andar chale gaye or jahrili gas kii chapet main aakar behosh ho gaye
 When the three reported unconsciousness in the tank, people immediately called the police and the fire department
 iske baad maukey par pahunchi police aurfaire vibhaag kii timne paas kii diwaar tod di or phir tanks main pani kii bauchhaar kar jahrili gas ke prabhaav ko khatm kiya

 For the Gujarat Assembly Elections 2017, on one hand, the Congress is trying to officially bring the youth leading the Patidars and Dalits along with them, on the other hand, the round of meetings has also started on the ticket distribution
 tikat bantwaare par charchaa ke liye november ke pehle hafte main party kii screening cameti kii baithak hone ja rahi he
 Meetings will be held in Gandhinagar, the meeting will be held on 3, 4 and 5 November at the party headquarters in Gandhinagar
 screening cameti kii is baithak kaa netritv balasaheb thoraat karenge
 Ajay Lallu, Girish Chandokar and Meenakshi Natarajan will attend this meeting
 meeting main vidhansabha chunaav ke liye sambhavit ummidavaaron ke naamon par charchaa kii jaaegi
 Hardik's arrival may increase, the party is unlikely to take any decision soon in the name of candidates
 darasal, iske peeche badi vajah patidaar netaa hardik patel se deal final na hona bhi he
 The Congress also offered to contest elections when Hardik Patel, Dalit leader Jignesh Mevani and OBC leader Alpesh Thakor had offered to come together
 aise main is baat kii bhi sambhaavna he ki agar alpesh thakor ke baad hardik patel or jignesh mewaani aadhakarik taur par congress kaa samarthan karte hai to unke samarthan vaale kuch ummidavaar chunavi maidan main bhi utren
 Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi may be on Rahul's tour, on the other hand, Rahul Gandhi is going to visit Gujarat once again
 rahul gandhi navasrujan yatra ke tisare charan ke liye 1 se 3 november tak gujarat daure par rahenge
 On 1 November, Rahul will start a public meeting in Jambusar
 iske baad 2 november ko vyaraa, vaasda, vaapi, valsad, naanaa paudhaa kaa daura karenge
 On the last day, on November 3, he will address a public meeting in Surat
 yatra ke baad rahul unai mata ke darshan karenge
 It is believed that till this visit of Rahul, the picture will be cleared on the youth support given to the Congress
 is daure par rahul or hardik patel ke bich mulaakaat bhi sambhav he
 In which Rahul can make any promise to Hardik Patel on the issue of reservation
 kyonki hardik ne congress ko aarakshan par stand clear karne ke liye 7 november tak kaa vakt diya he
 In such a situation, it is going to be very difficult for the central leadership of the Congress to finalize it keeping in mind the possible clash on the ticket

 congress nechunaav ayogse voter lists main farji or dupliket matadaataaon ke naam badhane ko ayog ke liye sabase badi chunauti bataaya he
 The Congress has also demanded a return to the ballot system for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and assembly elections
 mukhya vipakshi dal congress ne ummidavaaron or raajnneetik dalon ke chunavi kharch kii seemaa par kadi najar rakhane kii bhi maang kii he
 Explain that the Election Commission has invited suggestions from all political parties to take steps to improve the accuracy, transparency and inclusivity of voter lists in view of the upcoming Lok Sabha and Assembly elections
 congress ke mahasachiv prabharee (sanghathan) ashok gahalot ne chunaav ayog ko party kii ore se raay bheji he
 In writing, Gehlot has said that the biggest challenge before the Election Commission is the increase in the names of fake and duplicate voters in the voter lists
 gahalot ne likhaa he- “hairaan karne vaale khulaase saamne aa rahe hai or ye chunavi prakriya kii jad se ho rahaa he
 The credibility of voter lists, considered the backbone of democracy, is at stake for free and fair elections
 chunavi prakriya ke nattejey ko badalane or vikrut karne kii disha main is tarah kii koshishon par ankush lagaana pehali chunauti he
 If proper physical verification of the voting lists was not done and if a large number of bogus voters were allowed to remain in the voter lists then it would be like compromising the integrity of the electoral process ”
 matadaata soochiyon main farji or dupliket votaron kaa mudda uthaane ke alaava congress ne jor dekar kaha he ki bailat se matdaan karaane kii vyavastha par lautnaa samay kii aavashyaktaa he
 The Congress has written in its reply- “the future of democracy rests on faith in the democratic process and its independence
 haal main paaya gaya he ki iviem trutipurna thim or kai avasaron par kaam karne laayak nahin thim
 There were many complaints that the button was pressed somewhere and the vote went to bjp's election symbol Kamal
 isane iviem kii nishpakshta, swatantraaa or vishwasaneeyata par gambhir sawaal khadaa kiya he
 The use of more vvpats is useless if the paper trail is not counted
 bahut choti sankhya main hi vvpats ko hi cross check kiya gaya
 Due to this, this process of verification became just academic exercise
 aise halaat main congress kii majboot raay he ki chunavi prakriya kii swatantraaa or akhandta ke hit membalatopaper kii vyavastha par lautnaa chahie”
 The Congress has demanded from the Election Commission that transparency of electoral donations should be made public the full identity of individuals and companies buying electoral bonds
 congress ne chunaav ayog ko likhaa he- raajnneetik paardarshita vakt kii jarurat he or elactoral bonds kii khaid kii puri pahchaan jaahir karnaa ek aavashyak badlaav he jise amal main laayaa janaa chahie
 Anonymity should be treated with electoral bonds right now
 aisa nahin hua to jo thodi bahut paardarshita he ye use bhi khatm kar degaa
 Congress is also in favor of keeping a strict eye on the election spending limit of candidates / political parties
 congress ne apane jawaab main bijepi ke maujuuda shashan kii bhi ninda kii he
 Congress has said- “the influence of the current government on the power of money is increasing in the use of state machinery
 raajnneetik dalon ke sidhe yaa apratyaksh taur par vigyapanon, poster, hordings par kharch kii seemaa tay honi chahie, saath hi raajnneetik dalon ke sidhe yaa apratyaksh taur par chunavi abhiyaan ke dauraan helicopter, privet vimaan jaise transportesan ke kharch kii bhi seemaa tay honi chahie”

 Sources are telling that according to the papers the BJP will state that in 2007, Lalit Modi gave a loan of three crore rupees to Dushyant Singh and returned in 2009 through a check
 isamen koi mudda nahin he
 But, on the issue of why Lalit Modi bought 10 shares of Dushyant's company for around one lakh, the party says that Raje's ancestral property is worth about Rs 300 crore and Lalit Modi has valued his one share at around one lakh
 i did not give any benefit by keeping it

 sharad yadav ne apni hi party ke netaa kasee tyaagi or sabir ali ko naseehat de daali
 He said that those talking to the media should be cautious
 vivaad paidaa karne vaale bayanon se bachanaa chahie
 Significantly, on Saturday, Sabir Ali made a statement that if the BJP projects Modi as PM then the alliance with his party will be broken

 One must talk before speaking anything in the media
 'sharad yadav ne apni hi party ke netaaon se khaase naaraaz dikhe
 He said that something was said yesterday which i-nitish had not said

 Poison is dissolving in Delhi's air, so now the metro has come forward to save people from this pollution
 dilli metro ne elaan kiya he ki wo guuruuvaar se saamaanya dinon ke mukaable zyada train trip lagaaegi, taaki zyada se zyada log metro main safar kar saken or sadak par khule main pradooshan kii zad main aane se batch saken
 Delhi Metro will start increasing trips from Thursday morning and will add 186 more train trips throughout the day than in previous days
 dilli metro ke pravaktaa ke mutabik saamaanya dinon main metro 3131 phere lagaati he, lekin ab in pheron kii sankhya badhaakar 3317 kar di jaaegi
 Not only this, in non peak hours, the trains which are excluded from service will also be kept in service, so that people can travel by metro easily
 agar alag-alag linon kii baat karen, to gudgaanv line par kul 22 phere badaye jaaenge
 Earlier there were 679 train trips between Badli to Gurgaon, but from Thursday, 701 Metro trips will be made on this line throughout the day
 isi tarah dwarka-noida vaishali root par 20 atirikt phere honge
 There will be 772 rounds instead of 752 throughout the day
 sabase zyada trip mundaka-indralok line par badaae jaaenge, yahaan dinabhar main metro ke 108 phere badaae jaaenge
 Faridabad Line 36 additional rounds
 haalanki metro kii rohinee dilashaad garden line ke saath hiairport metroper pheron kii sankhya pehle kii hi tarah rahegi
 The Delhi government has declared a holiday in schools, but those who are going to office and have to go by two-wheelers or public transport will be most affected by the danger of pollution
 isi ko dhyaan main rakhte hue metro ne pheron kii sankhya badhaayi he, kyonki metro hi ek aisa public transport he, jisamen asi train main log safar kar sakate hai or safar ke dauraan unhenpradooshanse do-chaar nahin hona padataa
 Mother brought him to the womb for 9 months
 sab jatan kiya, lekin ab ek ajeebogareeb bayaan se na keval parivaar sann rah gaya, balki puure muhalle main baat jangal main aag kii tarah fail gai
 The claim is something that, if heard, do not believe at first
 agar dimag ko samajha bhi len, to dil maanane ko taiyaar na ho
 The bedridden Rajni has made a claim that after hearing the people of the neighborhood are shocked how in the end it happened? Have you ever seen or heard that Kokh has been kidnapped? In Brahma, Aganbadi, his wife Rajni, a teacher, was kidnapped on 15 April while she was going to school
 rojaanaa kii tarah vah skool se lautakar aa jaati thi, lekin 15 april ke din jab vah dopaher tak lautakar nahin ai, to gharavaalon ne rajani ko rishtedaaron or nursing home main har jagah talasha
 But when she was not found, Karaval Nagar reached the police station and reported
 baad main rajani ne police ko bataaya ki 2 burkedhari mahilaon ne uskaa kidanap kar liya or kuch nashili cheez sundha di
 All this happened on 15 April
 agle din 16 april ko jab use hosh aayaa, to uski kokh rahasyamay tareeke se gaayab ho gai
 It is alleged that someone took the child out of the womb
 police ne is ajeebogareeb kokh ke apharan kii kahani ko rojnaama main darj karne ke baad tahakikat shuru kar di
 Sued under sections 365, 34, 317 and 363 of IPC
 baad main tafteesh ke dauraan ek chaunkaane vaala khulaasa hua
 The police found something that was giving some other direction to this story of Kokh's kidnapping
 kuch sawaal aise the, jo police ko chaunkaa rahe the
 Rajni disappeared from home on April 15, so why did her mobile phone be left at home or was she intentionally left? Why is a pregnant woman, whose family is saying that the completion of 9 months, is allowed to go to school? Why did the woman take off the coil of her ears at home before disappearing? When the police investigated these questions about why the woman is silent since the incident, it was found that the medical board checked Rajni for hours and found that Rajni was neither pregnant nor she was aborted
 ab agar doctoron kii medical report ko sahi maan len, to mahila garbhvatee nahin thi, jabaki na keval mahila kaa pati or saas use garbhvatee bataa rahe hai, balki puraa mohalla kah rahaa he ki unhone mahila ke baby bamp ko dekha he
 Now who is true, who is false, it will be known only after investigation

 Actually, the BSP had supported the SP candidates in those elections
 unke bete or sapa adhyaksh akhilesh yadav ne usee jazbe ko aage badhaayaa or mayawati ke mal avenue ke ghar unase milane gaye
 This was the first glimpse of the unprecedented change in the politics of Uttar Pradesh that finally took place in January 2019 - after several decades of feud, the alliance of SP and BSP
 uttar pradesh kii 80 siton main se sapa 37, basapa 38 or gathbandhan bhagidaar rashtriya lokdal (ralod) teen siton par lard rahaa he
 For the first time in 25 years, SP and BSP will hold rallies from 7th April
 mayawati kaa mainpuri main mulaayam ke liye prachaar karne kaa vichaar tha
 Akhilesh and Mayawati will hold at least 25 rallies
 meerut vishvavidhyalay main arthshaastra ke assistant professor manoj sivaach kehete hai, ''2014 main ek bhi seat nahin jeet paane kii badanaami ko ulatney ke liye basapa ko musalmaan or yadav voton kii jarurat he, dalit voton par uski majboot pakad to pehle se he hi
 "that is why the party has fielded Muslim candidates from Saharanpur, Meerut, Amroha and Dhaurahra
" isi tarah sapa bhi musalamaanon ko rijhaane kii koshish kar rahi he or isiilie usne pashchimi uttar pradesh kii kairana, sanbhal or rampur sareekhee siton par musalamaanon ko tikat die hai
 The Congress could not join the alliance in Uttar Pradesh due to Mayawati's opposition, but the Congress, its national general secretary and in-charge of eastern Uttar Pradesh, Priyanka Gandhi had talked to Akhilesh for his party
 lihaaja, congress sapa ko bachaate hue aage bad rahi he or usne akhilesh ke chachaa or sapa ke baagi shivpal yadav kii party pragatisheel samaajawaadee party (lohia) ke saath haath milaanaa munasib nahin samajha
 But she is not ready to spare Mayawati and has fielded Muslim candidates against the BSP in Saharanpur, Bijnor, Amroha and Sitapur
 basapa ke un netaaon ke liye bhi usne apane daravaaje khol die hai jo sapa-basapa gathbandhan ke khilaaf hai
 These include three former Agra mlas Dharam Pal Singh, Thakur Suraj Pal Singh and Bhagwan Singh Kushwaha

 He visited the Kashi Vishwanath temple in Varanasi and visited Vindhyachal Dham in Mirzapur on the way
 lekin congress ke paas uttar pradesh kii sabhi siton par utaarne ke liye ummidavaar hi nahin hai
 There is resentment in the party for giving tickets to the defectors of BSP, SP and BJP

 koun kah saktaa he ki maujuuda ummidavaar (chouhan) aisa nahin karenge?''bhaajapa bakhubi jaanati he ki 2014 kii 71 siton kii kamyaabi ko doharaana aasaan nahin he
 There is very little difference between its vote share (43 per cent) and the sp-bsp's vote share (42 per cent)
 vahiin, donon partiyon kii sanyukt vot hissedari 42 siton par bhaajapa se zyada thi
 The saffron party knows the importance of UP
 lihaaja usne aise maujuuda saansadon ko tikat dene se manaa kar diya jinka rishta party main thikthak nahin chal rahaa he
 These include Ram Shankar Katheria and Chaudhary Babulal, mps of agra-fatehpur Sikri

 shah 30 march ko nagina main the, jahaan unhone kerala main vynad se rahul gandhi ke chunaav ladgaye ko tushtikaran kii raajnneeti kah daalaa
 The party is raising its anti-muslim voice in western Uttar Pradesh
 gautam buddha nagar main mukhyamantri yogi adityanath kii raily main shrotaaon ke bich akhlaaq kii hatya ke aaropee bhi maujuud the
 This is a very important and tough battle, especially given the number of seats in UP

 His pre-poll alliance is targeting a mixed vote bank of more than 35 per cent
 Yogi Adityanath and Keshav Prasad may still haunt him in his stronghold of Maurya Gorakhpur and Phulpur
 And OBC faces are planning to hold more than 100 rallies across the state: Priyanka Gandhi and Jyotiraditya Scindia are the Congress national Hasciv and UP in charge, she has put emphasis on increasing congressional support base in this election

 a three-member bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra, in its judgment on 8 February, overturned a 2014 Supreme Court ruling
 ye faisla jameen adhigrahan par jameen maalikon (adhiktar kisaanon) ke muaavje se sambandhit tha
 On Wednesday, a three-member bench headed by Justice Lokur called the judgment on February 8 by the bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra against the principles of law
 bench ne faisle ko ‘par incurium’ yani kanoonee simaaon kii avagya karke diya gaya aadesh bataaya

 On Thursday, when another case related to land acquisition came before a bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra, he referred it to the Chief Justice for final disposal

 a bench headed by Justice Lokur on Wednesday said that no High Court should depend on the judgment of 8 February 2018
 bench ne supreme court ke jajon se bhi is maamle ko deal nahin karne ke liye kaha he
 Justice Madan Lokur and Justice Kurian Joseph were involved in an unprecedented press conference held on 13 January this year in which four top judges questioned the modalities of the Chief Justice of India
 in chaar jajon ne press conference main supreme court ke chif justise ko bheji gai apni chitthee kaa hawala bhi diya tha
 At that time, the bench headed by Arun Mishra was described as the 'preferred Bench' (preferred bench) in the hearing of sensitive cases
 bharat main footbal kii deewangi dekhakar hi koi uskaa divaana ho saktaa he
 The Indian team is nowhere in the World Cup, but the lives of many Indians remain as if in this month-long celebration
 2006 main to vikaas dhorasu naam ke ek khilaadi ne francisi team ke khiladinnon kii fehrist main apni jagah bana lee thi
 Vikas was a resident of Mauritius, whose ancestors had arrived in Mauritius from Andhra Pradesh as indentured laborers
 lekin is baar to brazil main world cap ke liye muqabla kar rahi 32 tiimon ke khiladinnon main ek bhi bhartiya mul kaa nahin he
 However, there are instances in which players are playing for countries from which they (or their parents) have no connection with their birth
 masalan belgium kii team main congou mul ke khilaadi, switzraland kii team main albania mul ke khilaadi, england kii team main jamaica mul ke khilaadi, germany kii team main turki ke khilaadi, netherland kii team main surinam ke khilaadi, france kii team main senegal ke khilaadi, portugal kii team main guyani-bisuana ke khilaadi or america kii team main iceland mul ke khilaadi khel rahe hai
 But among so many countries, no player of Indian origin is seen in the team of any country
 haalanki duniya kaa koun-sa konaa aisa he, jahaan bhartiya mul ke log jaakar nahin based hai
 But in spite of all this, the craze for football in India is speaking head-on
 log der raat tak apni neend kharaab karke or tadake aankh malate hue itani lagan se match dekh rahe hai, maano un par koi sanak savaar he
 This emotional and spiritual connection of ours makes Indians special
 kam-se-kam footbal to aisa khel he, jiske maamle main koi hamen sankeern rashtravaadi nahin kah saktaa
 When i was scheduling a business call from one of my colleagues in Delhi, he said as soon as he left, "no, no, i will be watching the Colombia match at that time
" ’’yani jis desh main mere saathi ke kabhi pair bhi nahin pade honge or jahaan kii boli-bhashaa samajhnaa to bahut dur kii baat he
 Jahan's music (I can say it with certainty) he would never have heard
 lekin baavjood iske us desh ke khel se thodi der ke liye bhi nazren hataanaa use manjuur nahin he
 Colombia is of such importance to him that he is playing in the World Cup
 to, bhartiya footbal premiyon ke dilon main aisi vishuddh lagan he, jo deshprem kii dhara se dhundhlee nahin hoti
 This is what distinguishes football lovers of India from their cricket lovers
 cricket premiyon ke liye sirf bhartiya cricket team (yaa kahie ki vijayi team india) hi myne rakhti he or vah newjiland banaam srilanka yaa england banaam dakshin africa kaa match dekhne se behatar maut ko gale lagaana maanata he
 Once every four years, when the football World Cup fever rises, a question is raised in front of the Indian Diwan
 jabaki brazil yaa england, argentina yaa netherland jaise deshon ke log kabhi sapane main bhi is sawaal kaa saamana nahin karte
 The question is, who should be supported? In the fortunes of Indians, seeing their team coming out of the tunnel in the field, running like a lightning in the body, standing on the ground, listening to the national melody in front of the world filled in the field
 There is no realization
 na hi bharatiyon ko yah sukh naseeb he ki kisi begaane desh kaa divaana aakar apane uccharan main garv se bhartiya khiladinnon kaa naam hi le le
 Nor is the eyes of Indians happy to see the sight, when in the World Cup match, the camera focusses happily on the Indian audience in the field, beautiful Indian girls can be seen waving hands, dyed-faced Indian crazy drummers Look at playing ek arab se zyada kii aabaadi vaala yah desh is maha jashn se puri tarah gaayab he
 We had a chance to be a part of it in 1950, when the Indian team was invited to the World Cup held in Brazil last time
 lekin bhartiya footbal federation main prabhavi logon ne apni parajeet manodasha ke kaaran team ko na bhejne kaa faisla kiya
 That team could have made a place there
 lekin federation ko laga ki kharch zyada he or itnaa kharch bardaasht nahin kiya ja sakegaa
 Even today, India and Indian football are suffering the brunt of that short-sightedness and defeated mood
 vah ek aisa daur tha, jab bharat duniya main pichhadi manodasha kaa shikaar tha, apane bheetar hi zyada dekhtaa tha
 The aristocratic class that ruled the country shrugged their nose and brows in the name of competition
 pratispardhaa ke vichaar se is kadar nafrat ne hi hamaare kaarobaar, udyog, vyapaar or footbal sabhi ko bejaar kar diya
 And now that we are ready to compete with the world, we are not capable of moving forward
 bas ek chote-se daayre ko chhodkar, jaise ki cricket
 That is, a game that only a handful of countries play
 hamaari dasha duusare maamalon main bhi duniya main hode ke maamle main bilkul phiseddi he
 Our universities are not of global standard, our scientific research is very mediocre, our defense technology is also in the same condition, our industry is not capable of competing, our army is capable of fighting Pakistan with stubbornness (and China has got it i know)
 hamaare rajanyik bamushkil angreji bol pate hai (roosi or arabi kii baat to dur) or hamaari footbal team duniya main 154wein sthaan par he, singapore se ek ank upar or malaysia se ek ank neeche
 But our football fans will be almost or whole number because their love of football seems to be from above this place
 kisi jhande yaa desh kii bhaawanaaon se ekadam mukt hokar ve apni pasandida team chunate hai
 It is quite possible that in an Indian family, the father is on the Brazilian side and the son is crazy about Spain, the daughter likes the Italian team and the mother loves Argentine ras
 brazil ko lekar bharat main lambey samay se ek tarah kii deewangi rahi he
 This madness is not only because its players play a unique game, but it is a kind of feeling that Brazil is somewhat like India
 vishaal, arajak, teesri duniya kaa desh, jahaan bhayanak gaiyr-barabari he or shahar jhuggi bastiyon se ate pade hai
 It also makes sense that the people of Brazil look somewhat like us
 lekin jab ham us desh ke footbal premiyon ko or vahaan kii striyon ko dekhte hai to hamen aisa lagata he ki bharat ke vipareet brazil jaise desh duniya main kam hi hai
 Their liberal feelings about sex, loose moral behavior and behavior helps us, so we know that there is a limit to equality among us
 bhartiya diwane vishwa cap tiimon main shaayad apni yaa apane desh kii tasviir nahin talashte, balki vilakshantaa or khel bhaavana kaa vah muhaavara talashte hai, jo kisi raashtra kii simaaon main bandhakar nahin rahata
 Brazil plays football in such a way that the eyes of the whole world are drawn towards it
 haal hi main spain kii team bhi vaisaa hi khilne lagi he or argentina bhi bahut kuch usee tarah kheltaa he
 In contrast, both England and Germany (or, say, Germany from 10 years ago) seek their appeal among their countrymen
 lekin yah kahana bhi bilkul sahi nahin he ki bharat ke log un deshon se irshyaa karte hai, jo upar kii paant main to nahin hai, magar apni koshishon se hi vishwa cap mukaable main pahunch jate hai
 For example, Costa Rica, Algeria, Greece, Bosnia and Herzegobina, South Korea, the United States, Honduras, Iran, etc
 sach yahi he ki bhartiya diwane har chaar saal baad vishwa cap main bharat kii gaiyr-maujuudagi se niraash hote hai
 Even if they are happy to see their favorite teams
 jaise duusare desh ke khiladinnon ke naam hindustan ke ghar-ghar main jane-pahachaane jate hai, usee tarah unki khwaahish hoti he ki ek-na-ek din bhartiya khiladinnon ke naam bhi duusare deshon main jane-pahachaane jaaen or duniya bhar main faile duutavaason se adhik ve hamaare ambeseder bane
 Watching football in World Cup matches is painstaking, but in sports we get to see unique beauty and emotions
 lekin yah dekhakar dil bhi dukhata he ki ham kahaan khadey hai

 When i asked this question, i said that it is very difficult for me, because i do not know anything
 main yah sab kabhi sochaa hi nahin, maine jab-jab koi jimmedaari lee he use hi jindagi mana he
 Responsibility is my life and therefore i do not imagine that something has to be done to spend time in it
 iskaa na hi kabhi mere man main vichaar aayaa or na hi main iske bare main sochataa hum
 i am sure that every bit of body and every moment of life will be cut off in some mission

 Lalu Yadav termed the current election as a dignity and dignity at stake and said, 'the battle has gone through

 "the common psyche is also singing the tune of Omar Abdullah
" kya congress ke netritv valaupiemahagathbandhan, vah sach main aakaar le sakaa to, 2019 main bhaajapa kii aguwai vaale endie ke chunavi varchasv ko chunauti de paaegaa? is prashn kaa uttar to 2015 ke baad se hi vipaksh kii oonchi aakankshaon or gahari niraashaa ke bich jhul rahaa he
 The idea began to take shape after the bjp's defeat in Delhi and then Bihar
 1977 ke baad se hi desh main rashtriya str par mahagathbandhanon kaa lanbaa itihaas rahaa he par kisi mukhya rashtriya dal se takkar lene ko rajya stareey mahagathbandhan kaa vichaar ekadam nayaa tha
 Bihar's most ardent opponents of Other Backward Class politics, Nitish Kumar of the Janata Dal (united) and Lalu Prasad, the head of the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), hugged
 dosti ke is asar ko or gaharaa karne ke liye congress bhi saath aa khadi hui
 This is where a ray of hope for the opposition erupted
 may 2016 main bengal main hue chunaav main mamata banerjee kii prachand jeet se is vichaar ko or bal mila
 In an interview Lalu Prasad proudly said with a glowing face, "if the UPA unites in West Bengal, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Punjab, we will not let the bjp-led NDA touch the majority figure in 2019
 ''is baat kaa aadhaar yah he ki loksabhaa kii kul 543 main se 175 siten in chaaron rajyon se aati hai
 In 2014, the NDA won 112 seats from here, which is one-third of the total strength of the NDA in the Lok Sabha
 baharhaal, yah formula tabhi kargar ho saktaa he jab do staron par mahagathbandhan bane—pehla, in chaar ahm pradeshon ke ve sabhi dal ekajute ho jaaen jo endie ke baahar hai; doosraa, baaki pradeshon ke liye ek anya gathbandhan bane
 If the Grand Alliance is scattered at the state level, nothing can stop it from collapsing at the national level
 baharhaal, bhaajapa ne march 2017 main uttar pradesh vidhansabha chunaav main prachand jeet darj kii or vipakshi dalon kaa utsaah niraashaa main badal gaya
 The Grand Alliance did not work in Uttar Pradesh
 trikoniya mukaable main vipakshi dalon ko karaari shikast mili
 congress-sp alliance led by Akhilesh Yadav lost badly
 mayawati kii bahujan samaaj party kaa to uttar pradesh ke rajnatik paridrishy se safaya hua hi jaan padataa he
 Nitish's subsequent handing over of the NDA proved to be the final blow to the already cremated grand alliance
 gujarat ne phir jagaa di aascongress gujarat main bhaajapa ke haathon bhale phir haar gai par nattejey party ke liye thode sakaaratmak sanket lekar aae or vipakshi kheme main aashaaen phir se kulbulane lageen
 With the proof of being a Janeudhari Brahmin, Rahul Gandhi went into the election season with three more novice partners — Hardik Patel, Jignesh Mevani and Alpesh Thakor — by applying tilak
 is 'mini-mahagathbandhan' main mandal, kamandal, donon hi agenda ko saath-saath jagah milti dikhi
 What will be the result if Lok Sabha elections are held today? To understand this, two scenarios emerged in the India today-karvy Insights joint venture 'mood Survey of the Country' (this survey tries to find the political mood of the entire country every six months)
 pehla paridrishy, upie agar apane teen mukhya sahyogiyon sapa, basapa or trinmul ke bina lade, to use sirf 102 siten milane kii sambhaavna he
 Second scenario, if the UPA has a pre-poll alliance with these three allies, it can get 202 seats
 pehle paridrishy main endie ko 309 siten jabaki duusare paridrishy main 258 siten milane kii sambhaavna he, jo bahumat ke 272 ke aankade se kuch hi kam he
 Today, while the Congress is in Punjab and Nitish's change in Bihar has changed the equation, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal can be the only two major states where the possibility of an alliance opens up the doors for the UPA
 yah sambhaavna vaastaviktaa ke kitne kareeb dikhti he? kya mamata or mayawati apana ahankaar chhodkar rahul gandhi ke saath kaam karne ko raji hongi jinhen ve raajnneeti kaa nausikhua maanati hai? november 2017 main, sapa, basapa or congress agle loksabhaa chunaavon ke liye kramshah 30, 30 or 20 siton kii saajhedaari ke liye sahamat hoti dikhin
 a senior SP leader says, "akhilesh is not a Mulayam, he addresses Mayawati as 'buaji'"
 beshak unka aapasi talmail bahut acha nahin rahaa he par donon ek duusare kaa sammaan karte hai
 Both the SP-BSP are feeling that both of them will be wiped out if they do not compromise in the current political situation in Uttar Pradesh
 '' mathura se congress ke netaa pradeep maathur kehete hai, ''akhilesh or rahul ke bich pehle se hi dostana sambandh rahe hai or upi chunaavon ke dauraan isamen or paripakvata ai he
 Being close to Sonia Gandhi, Mamta is the pivot of this alliance
 unhone sansad main virodh pradarshan ke dauraan rahul ke saath kaam kiya he or unka maananaa he ki arvind kejariwal ko bhi is gathbandhan main shaamil kiya janaa chahie
 In the survey, Mamta was selected as the best Chief Minister for the second consecutive time
 ek or baat bahut saavdhaanee se samajhane kii jarurat he
 In the second scenario of the survey, the prediction for the upa-led grand alliance should not be misunderstood to predict the UPA victory in 2019
 teen saajhedaaron vaala upie kaa mahagathbandhan jeet ke aankade tak pahunchane ke liye paryaapt na hoga
 The survey considers NDA to be the biggest player in this situation
 kareeb chaar saal tak satta main hone ke baavjood pradhanmantri narendra modi 53 points ke saath rahul gandhi (22) se lokapriyata main ab bhi kahin aage hai
 Yet the survey shows that if the UPA managed to unite the partners, the NDA would fall behind the magic figure of 272 mps to form the government on its own
 naveen patnayak ke samarthan or dakshin bharat main diemke sareekhe kshatrapon ko saath laane se upie ke siton kii sankhya badhegi
 Who will lead the alliance? This will become the main issue of disagreement
 mamata or mayawati jaisi diggajon ko akhilesh yaa rahul netaa ke rup main sahaj sweekaar na honge
 The survey also had a question on this issue - who can give the best leadership to the non-bjp Grand Alliance in your eyes? With 23 percent of the vote, Rahul is the first choice, followed by Mamta (10)
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ke sabase achche vikalp ke rup main aap kis netaa ko dekhte hai?is prashn ke uttar main bhi logon ne rahul gandhi ko hi sabase behatar mana
 If you decide the leadership according to the number, then it will depend on which party brings the maximum seats
 par netritv kaa nirnay ho jane ke baad bhi, inamen se harek ilaakai kshatrap vito power se las he
 Any of these can be lost on any occasion
 maujuuda vakt main upie ke liye mahagathbandhan kii sambhaavna jitani ksheen dikhti he, aane vaale dinon main jo rajnatik paridrishy banenge ve or zyada chunauteepurn ho sakate hai
 Elections to be held in the states in 2018 are going to pose challenges before the Congress
 party ko karnataka main satta virdohi kaarak ko maat dete hue phir se rajya kii satta main vaapasi kerani hogi
 In addition, it will have to snatch at least two of the three bjp-ruled states - Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh, where elections are due in December
 yadi congress chaaron rajya haar jaati he to 2019 ke liye satta kaa sangram 2018 main hi khatm ho jayega
 The biggest challenge before the alliance is whether it will be able to dent the Hindu mainstream votes by keeping the voters of Dalits, minorities and rebel influential castes together, which Rahul is trying to attract? The answer depends on how and to what extent the alliance is able to vigorously challenge the Hindutva agenda of the NDA without disturbing the majority Hindu votes
 saath hi gathbandhan ko apana ek aisa agenda bhi desh ke saamne rakhana hoga jo votaron ko lubhaa sake or unhen gathbandhan ke prati aakarshith kar sake
 The upa's grand alliance will also need a reason, thinking ahead of the opportunistic game of increasing numbers and simply opposing the NDA on everything
 sampradayikta banaam gaiyr-sampradayikta kaa agenda ab ek pita hue formula ho chukaa he jo antat votaron ko bhaajapa ke paksh main lamaband kar detaa he
 The Grand Alliance will clearly have to put forward an alternative economic outlook for the country, along with it will need a winning electoral strategy and script
 rahul kii aguai vaali congress agar sanghathan durust kar le, sangheey morche ko phir se thik karne kii kargar tarkeeb khoj laae, mahagathbandhan sareekhe gathjod banaati jaae, to endie ko satta se bedakhal karnaa uske liye kori kalpanabhar nahin rah jayega
 *** agar aap master of bijness administration yani emb karnaa chaahate hai or soch rahe hai ki bina cat pariksha main shaamil hue yaa achche number naa laane par kabhi emb main admician nahin le paaenge to niraash hone kii jarurat nahin he

 haal hi main aam aadmi party ke mukhiya elaan kar chuke hai ki wo is maamle main gaiyr-bijepi rajyon ke mukhyamantriyon se mulaakaat karenge
 In a letter to the Chief Ministers of BJP and nda-ruled states, Kejriwal appealed and wrote, 'you should meet the Prime Minister personally and inform him of these dangers
 main jaanata hum ki aap bhaajapa / NDA se hai or aapke liye iske khilaaf bolnaa mushkil hoga
 But the Central Government wants to pass these amendments in the Winter Session of Parliament, which are very dangerous
 'kejariwal ne aage likhaa he, 'agar electricity act 2003 main prastaavit sanshodhan paas ho jate hai to bijli kshetra kii sari shaktiyaan kendra sarkaar main nihit ho jaaengi
 State governments will not be able to take any decision

 This will cause poor and middle class families and farmers to be badly bitten
 kendra sarkaar cross-sabsidi khatm karnaa chaahati he
 Now almost every state government charges higher electricity rates for industrial and commercial use and with that money farmers either give free electricity or take very little money
 'mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne chintaa jataai he ki agar kendra sarkaar dwaara prastaavit sanshodhan paas ho gaye to audyogic, vyavsaayik, gharelu or kheti-sabhi ke bijli ke ek hi rate ho jaaenge
 The Central Government also proposes to start betting on electricity
 isse to bijli bahut hi mahangi ho jaaegi
 Also, the back of farmers and domestic consumers will be broken

 gaya road rej maamle main aaropee jediu emelsi manorama devi ke bete rocky yadav ko mangalvaar ko 14 din kii nyaayik hiraasat main bhej diya gaya
 Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Yadav said that an incident like road rage was the result of a distorted mentality
 road rej jaisi aavesh main hone vaali nakaaratmak vaardaat ko rokna thoda mushkil he
 Yes, by taking immediate action and arrest on it, the government can break the morale of criminals and instill confidence in the public about law and order

 Tejaswi wrote a Facebook post under the 'apne Dil Ki Baat Program'
 tejasvi ne likhaa, ‘road rejki ek durbhagyapurna ghatana main aditya kii goli markar hatya kii ghatana dukhad he
 He has been greatly hurt by this incident
 kisi bhi yuva ke praan is tarah bevajaah naakaaratmak kaarnon se janaa durbhagyapurna he
 The amount of condemnation of this incident is less
 meri samvednaaen mritak parivaar ke saath hai
 The Deputy Chief Minister said, "the young man accused in this case should not be spared for such heinous crime
" main kade se kade shabdon main is ghatana kii ninda karata hum
 But the BJP leaders and its supported media are presenting this incident as if it is a rare in itself and the first criminal incident of road rage across the country
 ’ tejasvi ne kaha ki kisi abhiyukt kaa koi sambandhi agar kisi sattashin raajnneetik dal kaa sadsy he to iskaa arth yah nahin nikaala janaa chahie ki abhiyukt sarkari sangrakshan praapt he
 Why did BJP not remember Jangraj in Vyapam? Tejashwi said, accusing him of giving tickets to the most criminal image in NDA and giving political patronage, 'killing an IPS officer in Madhya Pradesh mercilessly by sand mafia It is done and in the Vyapam scam one by one the witnesses are removed from the way, then there is no opening of Jungle Raj
 ’ unhone padosi bijepi shasit jharkhand rajya kaa udahaaran dete hue kaha ki vahaan ek jeemem netaa tathaa ek ejeeniyar kii hatya kar di jaati he tab na to bijepi netaaon kaa soya hua jameer jagaa or na hi bhaajapa samarthit media ko jangalraj kaa jumala yaad aayaa
 Reminding the BJP of the Murthal scandal, Tejashwi said that the incidents of gang rape in Haryana, rape and road rage cases in the country's capital Delhi, seem normal and natural to the NDA leaders as the police there work under the central government
 unhone kaha ki aditya maamle main police kii twarit karrwai or giraftaar pichley bihar vidhansabha main karaari haar jhelane vaale rajg ke netaaon ke apni raajnneetik roti senkane ke mansoobey par pani pher diya he

 gauratlab he ki rajya main pichley 34 din main rape kii 19 ghataanaon ke baad hooda sarkaar nishane par he
 The protest is also about the fact that some ministers of the state have given many insensitive statements in the rape case
 vah bhi tab jab pichley somvaar ko hi congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ne jind main balaatkaar peedit ek ladki ke parivaar se mulaakaat kii thi or bharosa dilaayaa tha rajya main ladakiyon ko puri suraksha muhaiyaa karai jaaegi

 By the way, there is a separate department for this, through which government advertisements are published in newspapers
 doordarshan neshnal kii ek khabar ko ri- twit kiya he jiskaa sambandh india post pement se he
 On this day, the Minister has retweeted the tweet of Amit Shah, Arun Jaitley
 3 sitambar kaa din mantri ji ke liye kaaphi halkaa rahaa
 Had to tweet only two
 ek ayushmaan bharat par or ek krishna janmashtami par
 But suddenly they become active on 4 September
 @narendramodi ke 25 twit ko ri-twit kar daalate hai

 There are a few tweets and re-tweets

 magar 11 sitambar ko kaaphi kaam karte hai

 swatchta par khud bhi 5 twit karte hai
 The tweet informs about the launch of 3400 test practice centers across the country
 is din 50 se adhik twit or ri-twit ho jaataa he
 The minister's activism on Twitter is fantastic
 yah daawey ke saath nahin kah saktaa he ki maanav sansaadhan mantri pradhanmantri ke har twit ko ri-twit kar dete hai
 For this, big-data analysis of activism of other ministers on Twitter will have to be done
 kisi export ko pataa karnaa chahie ki pradhanmantri or pradhanmantri karyaalay ke handle se kiye gaye twit ko unke mantri, party ke kaaryakarta ke alaava anya log kitna ri-twit yaa likes karte hai
 However, we would like to remind the HR Minister that the re-tweets are not the resource ministers
 kaash ve ek saal ke bheetar dilli vishvavidhyalay main 9000 tadarth shikshakon ko permanent karne kaa vaada puraa kar pate or us bare main bhi rose twit karte
 You can also tweet the status of a court case or whatever the reasons are
 baaki desh main khaali padon or khaali class room ke bare main bhi to twit kar sakate hai
 Is it the minister's job to only meet, announce, tweet or re-tweet the inauguration? mere adhyayan kaal ke dauraan mantralay se sambandhit itani kam suchanaaen hai ki lagata nahin ki unke paas apana kaam bataane ke liye bahut kuch he
 They are engaged in retweeting the tweets of the party and the Prime Minister
 tippaniyan The activities of Minister's tweeter between September 1 and September 16 do not seem to have much effect
 soochna kii itani adhik bahulata he ki kai baar lagata he ki pradhanmantri kaa handle chamakate hi bina padhe koi ri-twit kiye ja rahaa he
 People have tweeted about many problems on the minister's handle
 ummid he un par karrwai hoti hogi
 The things that are reaching me are not according to that
 phir bhi mantri ko yah bataane ke liye likh rahaa hum ki aapke handle par aapke mantralay kii shikaayatein dekhakar kisi adhikari ko dar nahin lagata he
 It would have worked
 vaise mere is lekh ke bare main maanav sansaadhan mantralay ke adhikari or karmchaaree kya kehete hai, jaananaa chaahunga
 Their mutual gossip will be fun

 Let's retweet 25 tweets of @narendramodi
 shikshak diwas par puraskrit shikshakon se pradhanmantri kii mulaakaat par do twit karte hai
 These are his own tweets
 ek din main 27 twit
 Then on 5 September we work even harder

 Re-tweets 2 tweets of the Ministry of Human Resources
 up raashtrapati ke 5 twit ko ri-twit karte hai
 On this day the Prime Minister's handle re-tweets just one tweet from @narendramodi

 Cut to 5 September 14 tweet and re tweet
 6 sitambar ko twit karte hai ki 7 aaiem banane ke liye 2804 karod kaa bajet paas hua he
 Then tweets information about the launch of the Tamil translation of the Prime Minister's book Exam Warrior

 On September 9, @ bjp4india re-tweets 6 tweets
 10 sitambar ko bhi 3-4 twit or ri-twit he
 But on September 11, they do a lot of work
 @bjp4india ek chaiyn ke video cliping ko twit karata he
 He is re-tweeted by the HR Minister
 is twit main raghuraaman rajan ke patr kaa ek hissaa he ki upie ke samay zyaadaatar enpie he
 But those parts do not re-tweet that a list was submitted to the Prime Minister's Office against some companies
 phir suresh prabhu ke ek or telugana ke bijepi vidhayak ke do twit ko ri-twit karte hai
 Re-tweets a tweet from @ bjp4india again

 Then two tweets from his own handle
 phir @pmoindia ke handle se 11 twit ko danaadan ri-twit karte hai
 4 tweets themselves with their handles

 On September 13, @ bjp4india's handle tweets information about Goyal's press conference

 deshbhar main 3400 test practice centre ke shubharambh kii soochna twit karte hai
 This day gets over 50 tweets and re-tweets
 twitor par mantri ji kii sakriyata shandaar he
 It cannot say with a claim that the HR Minister re-tweets every tweet of the Prime Minister
 iske liye anya mantriyon kii twitor par sakriyata kaa big-data analysis karnaa padegaa
 An expert should find out how much tweets made by the Prime Minister and the Prime Minister's Office are re-tweeted or liked by people other than their minister, party worker
 baharhaal, ham maanav sansaadhan mantri ko yaad dilaanaa chaahate hai ki ri-twit sansaadhan mantri nahin hai
 i wish he could fulfill the promise of permitting 9000 ad hoc teachers in Delhi University within a year and would tweet about it daily
 court cese ho yaa jo bhi kaaran hon, uskaa states bhi to twit kar sakate hai
 In the rest of the country, you can also tweet about empty posts and empty class rooms
 kya sirf milan-mulaakaat, ghoshnaa, udghaatan hi twit yaa ri-twit karnaa mantri kaa kaam he
 During my studies there are so few information related to the ministry that it does not seem that they have much to say about their work
 ve party or pradhanmantri ke twit ko hi ri-twit karne main lage hai
 The comments 1 sitambar se 16 sitambar ke bich mantri ji ke twitor kii gatividhiyon kaa koi khaas asar nahin dikhataa he
 There is such a plurality of information that at times it seems that without re-tweeting the Prime Minister's handle is flashing
 mantri ke handle par logon ne kai samasyaon ko lekar twit kiya he
 Hopefully action will be taken on them
 mujh tak jitani baaten pahunch rahi hai, us hisaab se nahin hoti he
 However, i am writing to the Minister to tell you that no officer is afraid of seeing the complaints of your Ministry on your handle
 lagata to kaam ho jaataa
 By the way, i would like to know about this article what the officials and employees of the Ministry of Human Resources say

 Cut to 5 September 14 tweet and re tweet

 is twit main raghuraaman rajan ke patr kaa ek hissaa he ki upie ke samay zyaadaatar enpie he
 But those parts do not re-tweet that a list was submitted to the Prime Minister's Office against some companies
 phir suresh prabhu ke ek or telugana ke bijepi vidhayak ke do twit ko ri-twit karte hai
 Re-tweets a tweet from @ bjp4india again

 An expert should find out how much tweets made by the Prime Minister and the Prime Minister's Office are re-tweeted or liked by people other than their minister, party worker

 During my studies there are so few information related to the ministry that it does not seem that they have much to say about their work

 The comments 1 sitambar se 16 sitambar ke bich mantri ji ke twitor kii gatividhiyon kaa koi khaas asar nahin dikhataa he
 There is such a plurality of information that at times it seems that without re-tweeting the Prime Minister's handle is flashing
 mantri ke handle par logon ne kai samasyaon ko lekar twit kiya he
 Hopefully action will be taken on them
 mujh tak jitani baaten pahunch rahi hai, us hisaab se nahin hoti he
 However, i am writing to the Minister to tell you that no officer is afraid of seeing the complaints of your Ministry on your handle
 lagata to kaam ho jaataa
 By the way, i would like to know about this article what the officials and employees of the Ministry of Human Resources say

 kaash ve ek saal ke bheetar dilli vishvavidhyalay main 9000 tadarth shikshakon ko permanent karne kaa vaada puraa kar pate or us bare main bhi rose twit karte
 You can also tweet the status of a court case or whatever the reasons are
 baaki desh main khaali padon or khaali class room ke bare main bhi to twit kar sakate hai
 Is it the minister's job to only meet, announce, tweet or re-tweet the inauguration? mere adhyayan kaal ke dauraan mantralay se sambandhit itani kam suchanaaen hai ki lagata nahin ki unke paas apana kaam bataane ke liye bahut kuch he
 They are engaged in retweeting the tweets of the party and the Prime Minister
 tippaniyan The activities of Minister's tweeter between September 1 and September 16 do not seem to have much effect
 soochna kii itani adhik bahulata he ki kai baar lagata he ki pradhanmantri kaa handle chamakate hi bina padhe koi ri-twit kiye ja rahaa he
 People have tweeted about many problems on the minister's handle
 ummid he un par karrwai hoti hogi
 The things that are reaching me are not according to that
 phir bhi mantri ko yah bataane ke liye likh rahaa hum ki aapke handle par aapke mantralay kii shikaayatein dekhakar kisi adhikari ko dar nahin lagata he
 It would have worked

 There is such a plurality of information that at times it seems that without re-tweeting the Prime Minister's handle is flashing
 mantri ke handle par logon ne kai samasyaon ko lekar twit kiya he
 Hopefully action will be taken on them
 mujh tak jitani baaten pahunch rahi hai, us hisaab se nahin hoti he
 However, i am writing to the Minister to tell you that no officer is afraid of seeing the complaints of your Ministry on your handle

 But do you know that there is also a station where only 27 platform tickets are sold in a year
 ye stesan he chhattisgarh kaa jagadalpur railway stesan
 Three long-distance express trains run from Chhattisgarh's divisional headquarters Jagdalpur - Samaleshwari, Hirakhand, Jagdalpur Express and one-to-we Passenger Train, but the platform at Karelway station here has no ticket sales
 pichley maheene 31 march ko samaapt hue vittvarsh 2014-15 ke byore ke mutabik, jagadalpur stesan par sirf 27 plateform tikaton kii hi bikri hui he
 Officials say that on an average, only two platform tickets are sold here every month
 aisa nahin he ki log yatriyon ko chhodane stesan nahin aate
 Two hundred to three hundred passengers board and disembark in trains at Jagdalpur station every day and 25-50 people arrive at the station daily to send or receive passengers on the train, but none of them buy platform tickets
 darasal, plateform tikat kharidne kii kisi ko jarurat hi mahasoos nahin hoti
 Only 25-30 platform tickets can be sold, says Jagdalpur station superintendent John Kujur that only 25-30 platform tickets are sold in a year
 log stesan main suvidhaon main badhottaree kii baat karte hai, par jabplatform tikaton kii kharidiadi muddon par railway kaa sahyog kii baat aati he to peeche hat jate hai
 People will have to change the habit and show a cooperative attitude towards the railways
 bataaya gaya ki baahar se aane vaala vyakti, jise jagadalpur stesan ke bare main jaankaree nahin hoti he or vah kisi kaam se train chhootane ke samay stesan pahunch jaataa he to sirf vahi log kabhi-kabhaar plateform tikat kharid lete hai
 a railway official said that there is no system of checking tickets
 ho bhi kaise, jab plateform se stesan ke baahar nikalne ke liye ek darjan se zyada raste hon
 Due to the open space, ticket passengers easily exit
