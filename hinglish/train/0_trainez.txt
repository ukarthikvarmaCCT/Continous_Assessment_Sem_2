 Last December itself, the High Court dismissed the petition, but the Supreme Court said that we do not understand why this petition has been filed, so the petitioner is fined one million
 vakil ne is par maaf karne ko kaha to CJI ne apni ek kahani sunai ki jab vah hostel main padhate the to ek chaatr ko 25 rupee jurmaana laga, lekin us chaatr ne is par virodh jataayaa or kaha ki sirf 25 rupee kyon? zyada hona chahie kyonki main bade amir parivaar se hum
 You are an MLA, you should also say like a student

 When the lawyer asked for forgiveness, the CJI told a story of a student being fined Rs 25 when he was studying in the hostel, but the student protested and said why only Rs 25? Should be more because i come from a very rich family
 aap vidhayak hai aapako bhi chaatr kii tarah kahana chahie

 a year after the number of districts in the southern state of Telangana increased from 10 to 31

 The Union Home Ministry has not yet recognized the new districts

 Due to this, the Telangana government is not able to get funds under the central schemes and recruitment for government jobs has also stopped at the local level

 "telangana Chief Secretary SP Singh states that" one of the other benefits is that the relatively young and determined team is of district collectors who have made the work culture dynamic

 Referring to three of Brazil's highest goalscorers, he said, "cristiano is like our player late Vava and our Ronaldo

 RBI ne MSME ke aarthik or vittiya sthayitv ke liye dderghaavadhi ke samaadhaan ke liye 8 sadasyeey samiti kaa gathan kiya tha
 This committee has submitted its report to the Reserve Bank

 At the same time, the committee has also recommended to increase the Mudra loan limit from Rs 10 lakh to Rs 20 lakh
 yah jaankaree emsamai mantri nitin gadakari ne loksabhaa main puche gaye ek sawaal ke jawaab main di
 Experts say that the country's economy has slowed down

 Therefore, the RBI committee has suggested this in view of all the circumstances

 The story of the film is that of Harvard University symbologist Robert Langdon (tom Hanks) who is found in an Italian hospital after an accident, leaves Robert's memory and is accompanied by Siena Brooks (felicity Johns)
 siena ke saath milakar robert europe main gum gum kar kai saare suraagon ke saath ek virus ko nasht karne kaa bharpoor prayaas karata he
 Meanwhile, characters such as Harry Sims (irrfan Khan), Elizabeth and Vayetha enter, and finally get the film
 kamjor kadiyaan1
 While watching the film, you get the aroma of thriller element, but there is such thing as Khuda Pahar Nikli Chuhiya
 2
 The screenplay of the film is very weak and in view of your mind only one question keeps on asking why is this happening after all? The answer of which disappoints you even more
 3
 Abacker Tom Hanks appears in 'inferno' after playing the best role in the recently released film 'sali' but his character seems good only in the writing, Hanks' character does not leave a huge impact during the filming
 4
 The film has very big chessing sequences which are quite boring and because of them the length of the film also seems big
 5
 The climax of the film is very weak, which could have been made even more interesting
 kyon dekhegar aapako tom hanks or irafaan khan kaaphi pasand hai , yaa italy or istanbul ko parde par kabhi nahin dekha he to yah film ek baar jarur dekh sakate hai
 The box office film was first released in India and a week later it will be released in the US and 'UK' countries

 pradarshnakariyon kaa aarope he ki dharna dete hue 37 din ho gaya, lekin unhen sarkaar kii taraf se koi sakaaratmak jawaab nahin mila he
 a young protestor involved in the dharna said, "it is a hard-earned money in my life
" apane adhikaar ke liye lard rahaa hum or jab tak paisa waapas nahin mil jaataa, peeche nahin hatoonga
 Most of the protesters are women and they count their difficulties as how they have been facing everyday problems ever since the ban on withdrawing money from banks

 After raising slogans for one hour, the protesters celebrated Beach Road Bhai Dooj, a short distance from the RBI office
 purush pradarshnakariyon ne sabhi mahila pradarshnakariyon ko gulab ke phool bhent kiye
 An angry protester said, We celebrated Kala Navratri

 unhone logon ko bharosa dilaayaa ki ve mukhyamantri se mulaakaat karenge or uske baad dilli main vitt sachiv se bhi mulaakaat karenge
 The BJP leader, while trying to take people into confidence, said that RBI officials have said that protecting people's money is their first priority
 lekin naaraaz pradarshnkaree kuch bhi sunne ko taiyaar nahin the
 The atmosphere became tense and people told Somaiya that they need a concrete solution

 An angry protester said that the leaders come here to do their politics but no one is helping us

 After a heated argument, some protesters were allowed inside to meet the officials

 What happened in the meeting? The delegation's delegation made public the minutes of the interaction with the officials and said that the following things happened in the meeting: 1

 Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti and Prime Minister Narendra Modi held talks on Kashmir, stone pelting and other issues at the Prime Minister's residence on Monday
 baatcheet hone ke baad mahabuuba mufti ne kaha ki piem modi or vah kashmir main ek baar phir purv piem atal bihari vaajapeyi kii niti apnaane ke liye taiyaar hai

 1
 Mehbooba said that dialogue is very important for peace in Kashmir

 After automobiles, real estate, aviation, textiles, the tea industry of the country is also going through a difficult situation
 170 saal puraane assam kaa chaay udyog susti kii chapet main aa gaya he
 Due to rising cost of production and stagnation in the prices of tea, questions have arisen over the long term benefits of this sector
 philhal is industry ke liye koi raahat kii kiran nahin dikh rahi
 Tea planters of Assam are under stress and there are many reasons for this
 chaay kii keemten thahari hui hai, mazdooree or anya laagat badhati ja rahi he, maang or aapurti main baari antar he, dhulaai kii laagat oonchi he, nilaamee main sahi keemat na milane kii chunauti he or jalwaayu parivartan se bhi samasya khadi ho rahi he

 "chudail" ek aisa shabd he jo bharat ke logon ke man main gaharaai se basaa hua he
 You must have heard stories about its horror in the areas of the village and countryside
 log aae din is tarah kii bate bhi karte hue jaadu-tona or tantric ke chakkar main funs bhi jate he
 But have you ever seen or heard that a witch brought such a "whirlwind" to create chaos all around? Yes, if you have not seen or heard anything like this, then watch this video before Dil Tham, which has brought a stir on the social media platform at this time
 vartmaan main soshal media par chal rahe ek video khub viral ho rahaa he
 The video is reported to be from Ukambani village, a region in Kenya
 jahaan par ek maidan main carch ke dharmik kaarykram kii puri taiyaari kar lee gai thi
 Chairs, tables, band instruments and electronic devices were also installed
 video main dikhataa he ki kaarykram acchhee tarah se vyavasthit tha or bas mehmaanon ke aane kaa intazaar tha
 The members of the church along with the people of the village were slowly reaching there that suddenly there was a border in that ground
 bavandar bhi aisa ki maidan main tufaan laa detaa he
 Due to the tornado, plastic chairs all over the ground start flying in the air one by one
 vahaan lage electronic upkarnon or band bhi ud jate hai
 Suddenly, the people who came there from this whirlwind, start to run around in fear, making noise
 kuch log himmat karke puri ghatana ko mobile main kaid karnaa shuru kar dete hai
 Later on social media people started associating this natural phenomenon with a witch
 kaha jane laga ki vahaan maujuud chudail dharmik kaarykram ko hone nahin dena chaahati thi
 Some people even associate it with witchcraft, saying that Ukambani village, a Kenyan region, is famous for witchcraft in that area
 sambhavat: vahaan maujuud log main se kisi ne aisa bavandar laa diya
 So was it really done by a witch or a magician
 media report ke anusaar kaha ja rahaa he ki sabase pehle is video ko 1 agast 2018 ko utyub par samual mena (samuel Maina) naamak vyakti ke dwaara post kiya gaya tha
 After that people started watching it and went viral
 local media ke anusaar report main bhi yah bhi kaha ja rahaa he ki kenyayi ke is gaanv ukambani jahaan ye bavandar vaali ghatana hui he
 It is called the area of wizards and sorcerers
 ghana kii news website "yen
 com
 jiech" ne bhi is ghatana ko praathamikta se chapa he
 Many people are also making fun of it on social media and saying that it is Volta region
 yadi aapadharmik kaam karne ja rahe hanto agali baar pehle anumati maangen
 a few years ago, according to media reports, a football match had to be canceled in Kenya in November 2014 due to 'black magic' 'juju' when violence and riots erupted between supporters of teams on the field
 kuch saal pehle kenya ke citigen tivi ke patrkaar maaikel jenga or uske cameraman rashid jaaduugaron kii duniya par reporting karne kenya ke shahar kiambu pahunche the
 There, he became a businessman and met the famous female magician and tantric
 bataaya ki vyaper main unako ghaataa ho gaya he or isliye unke paas pahunche hai
 The lady tantric first asked her to bring some items for witchcraft and started treatment on fetching the goods
 is dauraan patrkaar maaikel jenga or uske cameraman rashid ne chupake se video bananaa shuru kar diya
 But journalist Michael Jenga was shocked when he noticed that his camera did not record anything after the first few minutes
 pehle laga ki yah kuch takneekee kaaran se aisa hua he
 So these people went there again and tried to record but again after the first few minutes nothing could be recorded
 is ghatana ke baad patrkaar maaikel jenga ne kaha ki main jaadu-tone ko nahin maanata lekin is ghatana se hairaan hum
 But can such natural phenomena be associated with witches or magic in today's scientific age? So the answer will be no
 kyonki bavandar aana ek bhugolic or mausamiya ghatana he, jo puure vishwa main dekhi jaati rahi he
 Can come anywhere in any season

 AIMIM chief and Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi said in Aaj Tak's special program 'takkar' that this is an unconstitutional bill
 ye bill laakar sarkaar ne muslim mahilaon ke saath ninsaphi kii he
 He said that BJP will now discredit Muslims through triple talaq
 unhone kaha ki supreme court pehle kah chukaa he ki teen talaak se shaadi khatm nahin hogi
 If you follow this bill, how will you prove it? What would happen if a husband would say that i did not divorce by saying three times? How will you prove agar purush par teen talaak ke aarope lagate hai to use teen saal kii sajaa milegi, lekin uski shaadi nahin tuutegi
 Owaisi said that there will be punishment and if marriage does not break, then only Muslim women will be in trouble
 yahi hakeekat he
 Owaisi said that there should be a law related to divorce, which provides for a sentence of three years for anyone except a Muslim
 shaadi khatm bhi nahin hogi or muslim purush jail main bhi daalaa jayega
 He said that marriage is a civil contract in Islam
 teen talaak ko khatm karne par mujhe koi aapatti nahin he
 This is a crime in Islam, but the law the government has brought is unfair
 unhone kaha ki supreme court ne poxo act ke maamalon ke liye 400 court banaae, lekin iske baavjood 9 pratishat kanvikshan he
 Owaisi said that there are strong domestic violence (498A) and sections like section 125 by this law
 bataa den ki teen talaak bill sadan se paas ho chukaa he
 The bill provides for punishment for men in the case of immediate divorce in the Muslim community

 ’’ Construction of this cultural gift given to Washington DC began in mid-april this year and was completed in just five weeks

 This 9 meter tall statue was built by five Bali sculptors who were led by a sculptor named Aayi Nyoman Sudarva

 indonesian duutavas ke ek pravaktaa ne kaha, ‘‘saraswati hinduon kii devi hai
 Bali of Indonesia is mainly inhabited by people of the same religion and Indonesia is the largest Muslim population in the world

 "this statue depicts the art of Bali," the spokesperson said
 ’’ murti main devi saraswati ke chaar haath darshaae gaye hai jo alag-alag sandesh dete hai
 One of these is an Akshamala in the hand which depicts the continuous process of knowledge, two are playing the Veena in the hand which symbolizes art and culture and the third has a manuscript and then shows the source of knowledge
 tippaniyan Also, the lotus on which Saraswati is standing represents the purity of knowledge and the swan is the symbol of wisdom gained from knowledge
 pravaktaa ne kaha, ‘‘yah murti saanskrithik pratikon kaa rup he
 We hope that its establishment will help us to promote the importance of mutual understanding in our diverse society

 Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Raman Singh has given clarification on the promotion of Sanjay Singh
 congress ke aaropon ko niraadhaar bataate hue unhone kaha ki sanjay singh se unka koi rishta nahin he
 Significantly, the Congress had called Sanjay Singh a 'brother-in-law' of Raman Singh and raised questions about his rapid promotion
 iske jawaab main raman singh ne kaha ki sanjay se unka koi rishta nahin he or congress jhuthe aarope laga rahi he
 Although it was already known that Sanjay did not have a relationship with Raman Singh, but since he belonged to the village of Raman Singh's wife, after a written complaint, on paper, he came to be called 'chief Minister's brother-in-law'
 teen saal main jiemban gaye sanjyacongress kaa aarope he ki mukhyamantri ke saale sanjay singh ne madhya pradesh main apni naukari kii shuruyaat class thri karmchaaree ke rup main kii thi, lekin chhattisgarh rajya ke gathan ke baad unhen niyam viruddh paryaton vibhaag main 3 saal main hi ji
 M
 bana diya gaya
 However, after the allegations of Congress, the tourism minister assured to investigate the matter
 congress ke mutabik, mukhyamantri ke saale sanjay singh par aaropon kii fehrist lambi he, jisaki vibhageeya jaanch chal rahi he
 According to party president Bhupesh Baghel, Sanjay Singh started his job as a Class Three employee in the tourism department in 1986, but the way he was promoted year after year has raised many questions
 saal 1993 tak wo senior tourist afasar tak hi pahunch paye the jo class tu kii post he
 i did not get inappropriate promotion: Sanjay, however, as soon as Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh got divided and he came to Chhattisgarh, his speed of growth suddenly increased
 2005 main unhen class tu afasar se sidhe pramot kar chhattisgarh paryaton vibhaag kaa dijiem bana diya gaya, jo kii class van kii post he
 After this, in 2008, he got G
 em
 Was awarded the post
 saal 2010 menmukhyamantri raman singhke hastakshar se unhen transport vibhaag main bataur joint kamishnar bhej diya gaya
 Sanjay Singh remained in the Transport Department till 2013
 2013 main dobaaraa sanjay singh ko paryaton vibhaag main jiem ke pad par posting de di gai, jahaan wo ab bhi naukari kar rahe hai
 Sanjay Singh says in his clarification that he never received an unfair promotion nor did he take any advantage by claiming a kinship with the Chief Minister
 unke mutabik unke pramotion kaa maamla bilaspur hai court main lambit he
 Despite this, they are being unnecessarily targeted
 darasal sanjay singh par us samay ungali uthi jab chhattisgarh ke mantralay main padasth apper sachiv ne ek shikayatakarta ke patr ko aadhaar banaate hue sarkari noteshit main safataur par 'mukhyamantri ke saale kaa karnama' shabd kaa istelam karte hue us noteshit ko tourism vibhaag main bhej diya
 The case caught fire due to the 'chief minister's brother-in-law' address
 yahi nahin sanjay singh par 6 karod rupaye ke gaiyr jaruri kaam karwaane ke maamle main bhi mantralay kii ore se notice jari ho gaya
 After these government documents were exposed, Sanjay Singh came under attack from the Congress
 haalanki unka yah bhi kahana he ki unka mukhyamantri raman singh se koi sidhe rishtedaari nahin he
 Since he belongs to the Chief Minister's wife Veena Singh, people call him the brother-in-law of the Chief Minister

 Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee has made it clear that she will not support the Congress candidate for the Rajya Sabha seat
 vahiin congress kaa ek varg kaa drudh mat he ki party ko is seat par daawa nahin chhodana chahie
 Asked whether the former Speaker of the Lok Sabha could be a joint candidate of the Congress and the Left Front for this seat, West Bengal in-charge of the Congress, Shakeel Ahmed said, "I am neither denying nor confirming this
" yah meri jaankaree main nahin he
 It was not discussed

 The Trinamool will clearly get three seats in the Rajya Sabha as 50 as the first preference for it
 50 sadasyon kaa mat he
 The Left Front will get one seat
 iske baad trinmul ke paas 35 vot bachate hai jabaki vammorcha ke paas 10 vot bachate hai
 The Congress feels that it can win one seat as it has the support of 43 members
 media or raajnneetik halkon main aisi atakalein hai ki loksabhaa ke purv adhyaksh somnath chatarji ko nirdaleey ummidavaar ke rup main rajyasabha bheja ja saktaa he basharte congress or vammorcha milakar yah nirnay karte hai
 When contacted, Somnath said, 'this is news for me
 iske bare main mujhe koi jaankaree nahin he
 On the other hand, when Shakeel Ahmed was asked if there will be a joint candidate of Congress and Left Front, he said, 'there is no question of joint candidate with Left Front at this time
 ’ unhone kaha ki somnath pratishthit saansad rahe hai or congress unka sammaan karti he

 When the matter reached the court, the court reprimanded the police and ordered an inquiry on the complaint of the teacher
 court is maamle main behad gabhir dikhaa
 The court said that this is a very sensitive and eye-opening case of the society and the government will have to take concrete steps in such cases, taking a serious stance on the dignity and safety of women teachers, especially those teaching in boys' schools

 Defense Minister AK Antony has rejected the Commerce Minister's proposal to increase the FDI limit in defense sector from the present 26 percent to 49 percent
 unka kahana he ki yah ek 'ulta' kadam sabit hoga, kyonki isse ek taraf jahaan videshi companiyon par nirbharta badhegi, vahiin gharelu raksha udyog kii vruddhi prabhavit hogi
 Antony has written in a letter to Commerce Minister Anand Sharma that FDI limits cannot be increased in the defense sector, because the country cannot afford dependence on foreign companies
 unhone likhaa he, videshi companiyon ko nirmaan ikai lagane kii anumati dena ulta kadam hoga, kyonki yah swadeshi dizin or vikaas ke raste main baadhak hoga tathaa atyaadhunik hathiyaaron ke liye hamaari nirbharta duusare deshon tathaa oiem (mul upkaran banane vaali companiyon) par hogi
 
 
 
 sharma ne pichley maheene antni ko patr likhakar raksha kshetra main epadiai seemaa maujuuda 26 pratishat se badhaakar 49 pratishat karne kaa prastaav kiya tha
 In response to this, the Defense Minister has written a letter to Sharma
 unhone likhaa he, isiilie raksha mantralay ne soch-vichaarkar yah nirnay kiya he ki raksha kshetra main epadiai seemaa 26 pratishat hi rahani chahie
 The defense minister also said that whenever the FDI limit is more than 26 percent, there will be a possibility of acquiring state-of-the-art technology, the Cabinet Committee on Security can decide on a case-by-case basis
 raksha kshetra main epadiai seemaa badhaane ke prastaav ke virodh kaa kaaran bataate hue antni ne kaha, swadeshi takneekee par aadhaarit shastr pranali kaa vikaas jaruri he
 He said, our effort is to create indigenous capability in this sector by encouraging private sector to join in defense sector
 ham apni tatkaal jaruraton ko puraa karne ke liye shastr pranali kaa aayaat kar rahe hai or yah tab tak ke liye jab tak ham khud apni pranali kaa vikaas nahin kar lete
 The comments vaanijya mantralay raksha kshetra main epadiai seemaa 26 pratishat se badhaane par jor de rahaa he
 The ministry had earlier proposed 74 percent FDI in the sector
 haalanki is maamle main raksha mantralay ke kade rukh ke kaaran ise ab 49 pratishat karne kaa prastaav kiya gaya he
 The Commerce Minister had said, i am supporting raising the FDI limit in the defense sector to at least 49 percent if 74 percent is not possible and my department recommends it
 agasta westland helicopter ghotaalaa maamle ke baad raksha mantralay sena kii jaruraton ko puraa karne ke liye swadeshi shastr pranali ke vikaas par jor de rahaa he
 He says that this will prove to be a 'reverse' step, as it will increase dependence on foreign companies on the one hand, while affecting the growth of the domestic defense industry
 antni ne vaanijya mantri anand sharma ko likhe patr main kaha he ki raksha kshetra main epadiai seemaa nahin badhaai ja sakati, kyonki desh videshi companiyon par nirbharta kaa vahan nahin kar saktaa
 He wrote, "allowing foreign companies to set up manufacturing units would be the reverse, as it would impede the way of indigenous design and development and our dependence for state-of-the-art weapons would be on other countries and oems (original equipment manufacturers)
" 
 
 
 Sharma had written a letter to Antony last month proposing to increase the FDI limit in defense sector from the present 26 percent to 49 percent
 isi ke jawaab main rakshaamantri ne sharma ko patr likhaa he
 He has written, that is why the Ministry of Defense has thoughtfully decided that FDI limit in defense sector should be 26 percent only
 rakshaamantri ne yah bhi kaha ki jab kabhi epadiai seemaa 26 pratishat se adhik karne se atyaadhunik praudyogiki praapt hone kii sambhaavna banegi, suraksha par mantrimandaleey samiti maamla-dar-maamla aadhaar par nirnay kar sakati he
 Stating the reason for opposing the proposal to increase the FDI limit in the defense sector, Antony said, development of weapons system based on indigenous technology is necessary
 unhone kaha, hamaara prayaas raksha kshetra main nijee kshetra ko shaamil hone ke liye protsaahit kar is kshetra main swedashi kshamta taiyaar karne kii he

 MP Election Result 2019: Like all the country, bad news has come for the Congress from Madhya Pradesh too
 rajya main hue loksabhaa chunaav (election Result 2019) main congress kaa lagbhag safaya hi ho gaya he or camel khulkar khilaa he
 This is the situation when Congress emerged as the single largest party by winning 114 seats in the December 2018 assembly elections and the BJP government led by 'mama' Shivraj Singh Chauhan had to be ousted from power
 congress party (congress) yadi vidhansabha chunaav ke apane pradarshan ko doharaati to kareeb aadhi yaa isse kuch adhik siton par kabja karti lekin 'modi magic' ne rajya ke siem kamalnath (kamal Nath) ke chehre par chintaa kii lakeeren laa di hai
 Contrary to expectation, the BJP is also seen to improve the performance of the 2014 Lok Sabha elections (2019 Lok Sabha elections)
 vah rajya kii 28 siton par badhat banaae hue he or congress keval siem kamalnath ke grihnagar chhindwara main hi aage hai
 Kamal Nath's son Nakul Nath is a candidate from Chhindwara and is leading
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ne 27 siton par kabja jamaaya tha or congress do siten kii apane naam kar pai thi
 CM Kamal Nath may increase difficulties, UP Governor asked CM Yogi to investigate the matter of land; People like Madhya Pradesh (MP Election Result 2019) also reiterated the slogan of 'namo Again' in 2019 elections
 aakhir aisi kya baat rahi ki vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi (bjp)ko dhul chataane vaali congress ke paanch maheene baad hi apana khaataa kholane ke liye sangharsh karnaa pad rahaa he
 According to political experts, the biggest reason behind this is 'brand Modi'
 narendra modi (narendra Modi)kii votaron ke dil main vishwasaneeyata barkaraar rahi or isi kii parinti banpar jeet ke rup main ai
 This support received by the BJP in the state has also forced the Congress to think

 a post shared by Sidharth Malhotra (@sidmalhotra) on Dec 6, 2018 at 1:54 am PSTA post shared by Sidharth Malhotra (@sidmalhotra) on Dec 6, 2018 at 10:43 pm PST rashtriya janata dal ke din thik nahin chal rahe
 On the one hand, former MP Mohammad Shahabuddin, on leaving the jail, told Chief Minister Nitish Kumar the leader of the circumstances
 vahiin taaja ghatnakram main nitish cabinet main number teen or lalu yadav ke bete tejpratap yadav ke saath ek faraar apradhi mohammad caff kaa photo saamne aa gaya he
 After several photographs of Tejapratap appearing in the media, it is clear that Kaif not only knew Tejapratap but had to visit him unannounced at Lalu Yadav's residence, where Tejapratap lives with his parents
 tippaniyan Who is this kaif? He is a resident of Siwan, whose name came in the headlines in the murder of journalist Rajdev Ranjan
 is maamle main giraftaar shooter rohit soni ne apane bayaan main sweekaar kiya tha ki jab rajdev kii hatya kar vah anya saathiyon ke saath ja rahe the tab caff ne unhen bhaagane ke liye bolaa tha
 The police was looking for him based on this statement
 haalanki siwan police kaa kahana he ki caff ke khilaaf paanch anya maamle lambit hai jisamen vah chori, rangadari or lut ke maamalon main aaropee he
 a court warrant is also pending against him in a case
 shanivaar ko shahabuddin kii jab rihaai hui tab caff unke bagal main khadaa tha
 On Tuesday, he was seen sitting at Shahabuddin's house in Pratappur, Siwan
 media ke saamne aane par caff ne safai di ki agar police talash rahi he to vah apane vakil se salaah lekar pesh hoga
 He described his picture as real with Tejapratap
 udhar tejpratap nishchit rup se is photo prakaran se pareshaan dikhe
 He said that a person would not have written on his face what he does
 unhone bhaajapa par sajeesh karne kaa aarope lagaaya
 On the other hand, on the issue of Shahabuddin, the BJP, sitting on a dharna on Wednesday, demanded the dismissal of Tej Pratap from the cabinet
 is bich rajdev ranjan kii vidhwaa aashaa ranjan ne dilli main ghoshnaa kii ki ve tejpratap or caff ke sambandhon ko lekar sarvocch nyaayalay jaaengi
 Although Rashtriya Janata Dal President Lalu Yadav is currently refraining from speaking on the issue, he is very upset with Congress President Ashok Chaudhary's statement in which he said that people of Rashtriya Janata Dal are troubled by Nitish Kumar's leadership
 They should leave the government
 yah caff hai koun? yah siwan ke nivasee hai, jinka naam surkhiyon main patrkaar rajdev ranjan kii hatya main aayaa tha
 Arrested shooter Rohit Soni in this case admitted in his statement that Kaif had told him to run away when he was going with other companions after killing Rajdev
 police is bayaan ke aadhaar par uski talash kar rahi thi
 However, Siwan police say that five other cases are pending against Kaif in which he is accused in the cases of theft, extortion and robbery
 ek maamle main uske khilaaf court kaa warrant bhi lambit he
 When Shahabuddin was released on Saturday, Kaif was standing next to him
 mangalvaar ko vah siwan ke pratappur main shahabuddin ke ghar par baitha dikhaa tha
 On coming in front of the media, Kaif clarified that if the police is looking for him, he will appear with the advice of his lawyer
 usne tejpratap ke saath apni tasviir ko asli bataaya
 On the other hand, Tej Pratap certainly looked upset with this photo episode
 unhone kaha ki kisi vyakti ke chehre par nahin likhaa hota ki vah kya karata he
 He accused the BJP of conspiring

 The 2015 all-round national level badminton player has shown more than one shot in Bollywood and has earned his coin in every role
 kamedi se lekar romance tak or mafia se lekar yuddh ke maidan tak, deepika ne kahin koi kami nahin chodi
 In 2015, he did three completely different films like 'piku', 'tamasha' and 'bajirao Mastani' and all three went well at the box office

 In the same year, Deepika has more than 30 million followers on Facebook and the number of followers on Twitter has crossed 15 million

 From the day Deepika entered Ranvir's life, her stars in the industry rose

 Even though Deepika is still hesitant, Ranveer is often seen doing 'public Display of Affection' with his lucky charm
 film akeli khinchne kaa rakhti hai dam'om shaanti om' main dabl role se limlite main ai deepika ne chandani chowk tu china, lav aaj kal, lafange parinde, brake ke baad, aarakshan, desi boij, cocktail, ye javaani he divaani, chennai express, goliyon kii raasalila-ram lila, finding feni, happy new year, piku, tamaasha aurabajirao-mastanijaisi kai popular filmein kii hai
 Critics believe that Deepika is at the stage of her career today that she does not need a popular male lead actor to make a film a hit or make a theater houseful
 balki bade actors khud unke saath film karnaa chaahate hai
 In 2015, Deepika Padukone launched her clothing line 'all About You' in association with online shopping site Myntra
 sutron kii maane to iske liye deepika ne 'mintra' or french dizin agency 'carlin' ke saath lagbhag 9 maheene mehnat kii he

 With films like 100 Crore Club's Ranikkottel, Race 2, Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani, Chennai Express, Goliyon Ki rasleela-ram Leela, Happy New Year, Piku, Tamasha and Bajirao Mastani, Sadeepika became the highest-grossing Bollywood actress of 100 Crore Club Huh
 khaas baat yah he ki aamtaur par heroinon ko saxes kaa credit na dene vaala bollywood deepika ko is achievement main hiroj ke baraabar rakh rahaa he
 Deepika was vying to do Vogue India and director Homi Adajania's video 'my Choice' about the 'my Choice' videowoman's empowerment
 iske liye unako kadi aalochana bhi sahani padi lekin deepika ne badi shaleenta ke saath liya
 It is his skill that it did not affect his career and image
 depressant ko sweekarajanvari 2015 main deepika ne khulaasa kiya ki 2014 main vah depressant se jujh chuki hai
 On one hand, Jahandipika was getting accolades from everywhere, on the other hand, on waking up suddenly one morning, he found his life empty
 kuch din to unhone is feeling ko ignor kiya, lekin achaanak ek din apni maa ke saamne wo gubaar foot hi padaa
 After fighting her depression, Deepika started this foundation to help such people on the occasion of 'world Mental Health Day'

 At the same time, Deepika has also moved forward with Ranveer Singh
 bollywood main aise brallep aam hai lekin aksar sitare in baton kon lekar kadavaahat bhula nahin pate
 But not only friendship with Ranbir, Deepika has also set an example by doing films with him

 Constitutional cases expert and Supreme Court lawyer Virag Gupta told the news agency, "if Ajit Pawar and Jayant Patil (new MLA leader) issued a whip during the floor test, the majority of the defections with controversy The case will also be made

 In the event of a dispute over majority, election of the speaker and defection, the case may come up again in the next round in the Supreme Court
 "viraag gupta ne aage kaha, "ajit pavaar ke vip ko do binduon par vaidhata mil sakati he
 For example, Sharad Pawar has removed him from the post of Legislature Party leader but not removed from the party

 This will reduce the figure to 118 for the majority

 The BJP has claimed the support of its 105 and 13 independents
 devendra fadanvis kii maujuudagi main pichley dinon hui baithak main 118 vidhayak maujuud rahe hai
 BJP leaders believe that before the oath, Ajit Pawar had given a letter of support as the leader of the Legislature Party, hence the legal tensions do not arise
 maharashtra main sarkaar to ban gai, par kya sthir rah paaegi, is sawaal par bhaajapa ke rashtriya pravaktaa gopal krishna agarwal ne samachar agency se kaha, "ajit pavaar vidhayak dal ke netaa kii haisiyat se bhaajapa ko samarthan die, jisase bhaajapa ke vidhayak dal ke netaa devendra fadanvis mukhyamantri bane, kahin koi roda nahin he
 The party will prove its majority in the house

 Sources are telling that the breakdown of two-thirds of mlas of a party is necessary to avoid the defection law
 aise main teenon dalon ke kai vidhayakon se istife dilaakar bijepi bahumat ke aankade ko itnaa kareeb laana chaahegi, jahaan tak vah pahunch sake
 However, it is not very easy for the BJP

 dalit sanghathanon ne sarkaar ke prati apni naaraazgi jaahir kii, to vipakshi partiyon ne bhi sarkaar ko is mudde par gheraa
 The government has been on the backfoot over the past few days on this issue
 lekin ab sarkaar daliton ko manaane ke liye ab bada kadam uthaane vaali he
 Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad told India Today that the government has all the routes open
 sarkaar main sutron kii maane to kanoon mantralay is par adhyadesh laane kii taiyaari kar rahaa he
 However, the government has also filed a review petition in the Supreme Court on this
 phir bhi lagaataar badhate janata or raajnneetik dabaav ke chalate sarkaar koi risk nahin lenaa chaahati he
 If sources are to be believed, the government can move towards the ordinance if no solution is found out of the petition filed in the Supreme Court
 sutron kii maane to somvaar ko ravishankar prasad ne adhyadesh ke mudde par grahamantri rajnath singh se lambii baat kii
 However, there was no comment from the government
 sarkari sutron kaa saaf kahana he ki sarkaar maanati he ki supreme court kanoon nahin bana saktaa he, kanoon bananaa sansad kaa hi kaam he
 However, it is not yet decided whether the government will bring the ordinance as a review petition has also been filed on this matter
 supreme court main is mudde par sahi se tark naa dene ke kaaran sarkaar aalochana kaa shikaar ho rahi he
 But due to the fact that it does not harm the BJP in the Karnataka elections, caution is being taken now
 vahiin monsoon seshan main sarkaar is par nayaa bill bhi pesh kar sakati he
 According to the BJP leader, if the government brings the ordinance, no party will oppose it

 - input agency Dada Kondke, an actor and producer of Marathi films, is considered a hero of the common man
 filmon main unki dabl mining kamedi ko khaasaa pasand kiya gaya
 There was a time when 9 of his films were in theaters for 25 weeks

 Today is the birth anniversary of Dada Kondke
 unka janm 8 agast 1932 ko hua tha
 Titles of Dada's films were also such that the censor board used to get sweaty in passing the film
 dohare arthon vaale in tital ko sensor board tamaam koshish karke bhi bain nahin kar paaya
 Dada Kondke passed away on 14 March 1998 in Dadar, Mumbai after playing a long innings in the film industry
 dada kondke kii 1975 main ai film pandu hawaldaar behad charchit rahi thi
 In this, he played the title character
 is film ke baad hi havaldaaron ko pandu kaha jane laga tha
 His other popular films are Songadya, Aali Angawar etc

 khitaab kaa prabal daavedaar bharat 2011 cricket vishwa cap ke shuruaati mukaable main shanivaar ko jab sah-mejabaan bangladesh kaa saamana karegaa, to uski nazren badla lene par tiki hongi
 Mahendra Singh Dhoni's team, however, will be completely cautious, as any outrage may outweigh them
 bangladesh kii kamjor maani jane vaali team ne westeindies main 2007 vishwa cap main bharat ke shuruaati match main hi use haraakar team ko pehle daur se hi baahar karne kii neenv rakhi thi or dhoni tathaa unki team is haar kaa badla chukaakar sher-e-bangla stadium main apane abhiyaan kii sakaaratmak shuruyaat karne ke lakshya ke saath utregi
 The world number two Indian team is among the contenders for the title, but due to the presence of talented players, captain Dhoni may face selection issues
 dhoni ne haalanki lagata he ki ballebaaji vibhaag kii apni samasya kaa samaadhaan kar liya he, jab unhone newjiland ke khilaaf duusare abhyaas match ke baad suresh raina par viraat kohli ko tarjeeh dene ke sanket die
 Dhoni said, number four order is very important for us
 philhal yah sthaan jang kii tarah bana hua he
 Kohli needs to bat at number four, while Gautam Gambhir will be at number three
 dhoni ne kaha, kohli aisa khilaadi he, jo shuruyaat main jamane ke liye thodaa samay letaa he or phir gendbaajon par prahaar karata he
 Nevertheless, there is a possibility that Virat gets preference over (suresh) Raina given the form that exists
 bhartiya captain ne saath hi sanket die ki vah yuvaraj ko khilaaenge, kyonki balle se kharaab farm ke baavjood gend spin karaane kii apni kshamta ke kaaran vah team ke liye ahm hai
 He said, we are playing with four bowlers
 kaamchalaoo spinner kaaphi ahm he, visheshkar tab jab vah baayen haath kaa spinner ho, jo gend ko baahar kii ore spin karaata ho
 He (yuvraj) has the upper hand over the other players
 bhartiya ballebaaji akraman kii aguai sachin tendulkar karenge, jo apane chathe vishwa cap toornament main shirkat kar rahe hai or unki nazren virendra sahvaag ke saath milakar bharat ko tej shuruyaat dene par tiki hongi
 Gautam Gambhir will come out to bat at number three, while the middle order looks quite strong in the presence of Kohli, Dhoni, Yuvraj and Yusuf Pathan
 in sabhi khilaadiyon main bade shot khilne or strike rotate karne kii kshamta he
 India had scored a mammoth score of 360 against New Zealand in their second and final warm-up match and this would have boosted the morale of the batsmen, especially Dhoni and Gambhir
 dhoni ne is match main naabad 108, jabaki gambhir ne 89 ran kii pari kheli thi
 India beat West Indies by 318 runs on the fourth day of the first Test match thanks to the stormy bowling of 'yorkman' Jaspreet Bumrah (5 for 7)
 iske saath hi team india ne do maichon kii test siries main 1-0 kii badhat bana lee or apane pehle vishwa test championships match main 60 ank hasil kar liye
 It is the dream of any bowler to take as many wickets for less runs
 25 saal ke jasprit bumraah antiga test main aisi hi uplabdhi hasil karne main kaamyaab rahe or bada kirtiman rach daalaa
 Bumrah became the Indian bowler to take 5 or more wickets in an innings of a Test by giving the lowest runs
 bumraah se pehle yah record venkatapati raju ke naam tha, jinhone 1990 main srilanka ke khilaaf chandigarh main 12 ran dekar 6 wicket chatkaaye the

 dilli main aparaadh lagaataar badhata ja rahaa he, lekin sabase zyada maamle mobile jhapatmari ke saamne aate hai
 Everyday millions of phones are either snatched or stolen
 aise main police chaahakar bhi in vaardaaton ko rokane main naakaam rahi he
 However, this time the Delhi Police has uncovered a gang who used to not only steal mobiles in Delhi, but sold these stolen mobiles outside the country to Nepal
 ye gang behad shaatir tareeke se jhapatmaron se mobile lekar nepal bhejte the
 So far, these people have sent more than 10 thousand mobile Nepal, whose value is being told in crores
 police ne inke paas se kul 311 smartphone baraamad kiye hai jinaki keemat 60 lakh se zyada bataai ja rahi he
 From iphone to Samsung, from Vivo to Oppo, there is no such expensive phone that is not kept here
 ye 311 smartphone jinaki keemat kareeb 60 lakh se zyada he, ye kisi showrooms main nahin, balki jhapatmari or jebtaraashi kar ikaithe kiye gaye wo phone hai, jinako nepal bhejne kii taiyaari chal rahi thi
 But before this the crime branch recovered these mobiles and the whole gang got caught
 krime branch ke disipi rajesh dev ke mutabik, is gang ke kul 7 log giraftaar hue hai, jinamein jhapatmar, khariddaar, bichauliya or aakhir main phone ko nepal bhejne vaala bhi shaamil he
 In this gang, a person named Rohit used to snatch the mobile
 mukesh, naresh, gopal pathak or rajan ye wo log hai jo rohit or dilli ke duusare darjanon jhapatmaron se mobile kharidte the
 The second king sitting in an office in Karol Bagh used to buy mobiles from these four, then the king used to sell these mobiles in bulk to a person named Ram Singh from Nepal
 ram singh nepal main baithe mobile resiver kaa karmchaaree he jise yahaan isi kaam ke liye naukari par rakhaa gaya tha
 The police had been tracking this gang for about a month

 Everyone's work is done in this gang
 systmatic tareeke se gang apana kaam kar rahaa tha
 Most of the people in this gang were those who used to do mobile repairing in the Ghaffar market of Karol Bagh, but they came into this business due to reduced profits
 police ke mutabik ye log har hafte kareeb 60 mobile dilli se baahar nepal bhejte the
 In the last year and a half, this gang has sent more than 10 thousand mobiles to Nepal, whose value is being told in crores
 pakade gaye mobile phonon main 90 yphone he
 According to the police, these people used to sell mobiles in Nepal so that they could not be caught even through the IMEI number in the phone
 darasal, bharat main kisi bhi phone ko iemai number ke jariye sirf bharat main pakadaa ja saktaa he
 In such a situation, once this phone went out of India, it is very difficult to get hold of it and that is why they used to send it to Nepal without changing the IMEI number of the phone
 krime branch inase baraamad hue 311 mobile phone ke iemiai number dilli police kii website par do din main lod kar degi
 In such a situation, the police has appealed to those people whose mobile phones have been stolen or lost, they should check through the IMEI number of their missing phones whether they have any of these phones

 Any significant deviation from the basic principle of meaningful international dialogue and cooperation is likely to reduce the efforts made by the Human Rights Council for human rights protection and universal respect for fundamental freedoms
 ' He also said that no external inquiry mechanism reflected the approach that was envisaged through the positive attitude of dialogue and cooperation in the proposals previously brought to the General Assembly

 The judiciary witnessed an extraordinary situation on Friday for the first time in the country
 supreme court ke maujuuda 4 jajon ne media ko sambodhit kiya
 Justice Chelameswar, the second-most senior judge after the Chief Justice, said in a press conference that the administration of the Supreme Court is not functioning properly, if this continues, the democratic situation will not be good
 unhone kaha ki hamane is mudde par chif justise se baat kii, lekin unhone hamaari baat nahin suni
 Along with this, Justice Chelameswar, Justice Ranjan Gogoi, Justice Madan Lokur and Justice Kurian Joseph also made public a letter written to Chief Justice Deepak Mishra
 jajon ne bataaya ki chaar maheene pehle ham sabhi ne chif justise ko ek patr likhaa tha
 We raised some issues which were about administration but those issues were unheard of
 jaaniye is letters main justise chelmeshwar sahit chaaron jajon ne kya pramukh baaten kahi:roster banane kaa adhikaar sahi kaamkaaj ke liye, na ki varisht banane ke liejustise chelmeshwarasahit 4 jajon ne letters main likhaa ki yah satya he ki chif justise ke paas cese kaa roster banane kaa adhikaar hota he
 However, this right has been given to run the functioning of the Supreme Court and to keep discipline in it
 isse kisi ko varisht athurity banane kaa adhikaar nahin mil jaataa he
 In such a situation, the Chief Justice cannot consider himself above his colleagues
 desh ke samvidhan ke mutabik chif justise baaki jajon main pehle jarur hai, lekin kisi se bade nahin or na hi kisi se chote hai
 The cases were not dealt on merit
 The important allegations made by the 4 judges, including Justice Chelameswar, include that in the current court system, the cases were not dealt to the best of their ability
 justise chelmeshwar sahit 4 jajon ne letters main likhaa he ki yah jaruri siddhant he ki roster main mukademon ko unki merit ke hisaab se unhen sahi bench ko saunpa jaae
 Justice Chelameswar and other judges alleged that this basic rule has not been followed in recent times
 kai mahatvapurn cese, jinka desh or nyaayik vyavastha par khud doorgaami prabhaav pad saktaa tha, vaise mukademon ko chif justise dwaara apane pasandida bechon ko dene kaa kaam kiya gaya
 However, the court was expected to allocate the cases in a rational manner
 nahin kiya or khulaasa jisase supreme court na ho or sharmindajustise chelmeshwar samet sabhi jajon ne apane letters main yah bhi zikr kiya ki vah is bare main zyada detail main sirf isliye jaankaree nahin de rahe hai, kyonki isse supreme court ko zyada sharmindagi jhelni pad sakati he
 However, such behavior has already hurt the dignity of the Supreme Court to some extent
 memorondom of proscisger banane main or deree na hojustise chelmeshwar or anya jajon ne apane letters main arapy luthra cese kaa zikr kiya he
 4 Judges have demanded that it is necessary in the public interest that no further delay in finalizing the Memorandum of Procedure
 aapako bataa den ki in jajon ne is maang se us gambhir chintaa kii taraf dhyaan aakarshith he jiske kaaran hoicourt main jajon ke kai pad rikt pade hai
 Significantly, in this case on October 27, the Supreme Court issued a notice to the Central Government on the delay in the Memorandum of Procedure (MOP) regarding the appointment of judges in the High Court and the Supreme Court
 aapako bataa den ki luthra ne MOP ke bina hoicourt or supreme court main jajon kii niyukti ko hoicourt main chunauti di thi
 He filed an application in the Supreme Court after the High Court dismissed the petition
 pichley saal janvari se hi supreme court or sarkaar MOP ko final karne kii koshish kar rahe hai
 The judges have raised the question as to how any other bench in the Luthra case was empowered to deal with the Supreme Court Advocate on Record Association and others v Government of India case (2016), when the case was dealt with by the Constitutional Bench
 Could it go? 4 judges, including Justice Chelameswar, have told Chief Justice Deepak Mishra in a letter that when they deal adequately with the matters related to the Luthra case then the need Dne will be given information about the other cases were passed by courts in the past
 justise karnan cese kaa bhi zikr kiyajustise chelmeshwar or anya jajone apane letters main supreme court kii avmaananaa ke liye 6 maheene jail kii sajaa kaatane ke baad reeha hue ritred justise karnan ke maamle kaa bhi zikr is patr main kiya he
 Let us tell you that in the order of 4 July 2017, Justice J
 chelameshwar or justise ranjan gogoi ne alag se likhe jajment main ye kaha tha ki jo samasya saamne ai he usamen unka opinian ye he ki sanvaidhanik court ke liye jajon kii niyukti ke maamle main jo sellection prakriya he use dobaaraa dekha janaa chahie
 Also, to deal with such a case, other than impeachment, other appropriate legal remedies should be considered
 iske saath hi chaaron jajon ne apane letters main maang kii ki chif justise deepak mishra kaa yah kartavya banataa he ki ve in maamalon par karrwai karen or purv main hui galatiyon ko sudhaare

 loksabhaa chunaav 2019 ko lekardilli main aam aadmi party(aa)) or congress ke bich gathbandhan ko lekar maathapai jari he
 Whether there will be an alliance between the Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party is being discussed on both sides

 This is the reason that after much fanfare, the Aam Aadmi Party announced the names of its candidates in 6 Lok Sabha seats in Delhi
 haalanki, aam aadmi party ne gathbandhan ke daravaaje ko band nahin kiya he
 The Aam Aadmi Party has suggested two formulas for alliance with the Congress and if we look at these formulas then in a way it is now a bargain
 sutron kii maane to ab aam aadmi party ne congress ko gathbandhan ke liye do formula sujhaayaa he
 Now Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party is in the mood to deal seats
 aam aadmi party ke pehle formula ke tahat AAP chaahati he ki dilli main aam aadmi party 6 siton par lade or congress mahaj ek par
 In this case, the Aam Aadmi Party will not contest elections again, where the Congress will be
 vahiin duusare formula ke tahat aam aadmi party kaa kahana he ki agar dilli main congress ko zyada siten chahie to use punjab, haryana jaise rajyon main seat dekar isaki bharpai kerani hogi
 This claim of sources is also confirmed by this fact as the Aam Aadmi Party has so far announced the names of its candidates on 6 out of 7 Lok Sabha seats in Delhi
 unhone abhi tak ek seat par apana patta nahin kholaa he
 It is believed that the Aam Aadmi Party still believes that if an alliance is made with the Congress, then the seventh seat will be left for it
 idhar, mangalvaar ko dilli main aam aadmi party ke saath congress ke gathbandhan ko lekar congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne baithak bulaai he
