 upi ke chunavi poster dekhiye, vahaan likhaa he ki palaayan ab band hoga
 It has been proudly told in this survey that ninety million people go from one place to another every year in search of work by train
 yani aarthik survey ke liye palaayan good he, vot lene ke liye bed he
 However, seven out of 100 voters pay Jana and satellite has shown that in Jaipur and Bengaluru only 5 to 20 percent pay property tax
 aarthik survey main is baat kii kya zarurat thi
 Is it being said that someone is a strong leader, democracy should not be hindered, he should progress according to his own and then his profit should be shared among all
 turant nattejey par mat pahunchiye, pehle padhiye or samajhiye ki kya kaha ja rahaa he
 In what context is it being said
 bharat ke rajya chahen jitna daawa karen, aarthik survey kahata he ki rajyon kaa sakal vittiya ghaataa badhata ja rahaa he
 Look at the election poster of UP, it is written that the migration will stop now
 is survey main garv ke saath bataaya gaya he ki nabbe lakh log har saal train se kaam kii talash main ek jagah se duusari jagah jate hai
 That is, migration is good for economic survey, bad for taking votes
 vaise 100 voter main saat janaa hi tex dete hai or satellite se pataa chalaa he ki jaipur or bengalooru main 5 se 20 pratishat hi property tex dete hai

 ) Rashtriya Janata Dal President Lalu Prasad on Wednesday attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi fiercely
 lalu yadav ne piem modi par vaadakhilaphi kaa aarope lagaate hue kaha ki piem modi ne bihar ke liye package dene kaa vaada kiya tha lekin wo 'farrage' niklaa
 On the revelations from RTI, Lalu Yadav said that Modi gave Bihar 1 during the October 2015 assembly elections
 25 lakh karod rupee kaa package dene kaa vaada kiya tha, jiske milane kaa aaj bhi intjaar ho rahaa he
 The RJD, JDU and the Congress, which are part of the ruling Grand Alliance in Bihar, targeted the bjp-led central government and the opposition BJP in the state after receiving information from RTI
 mahagathbandhan ke netaaon kaa kahana he ki yah ek bada sawaal he ki modi or bijepi padosi rajya uttar pradesh main bhi vidhansabha chunaaon ke dauraan 'dhuandhar' vaade kar rahe hai, lekin unke puraa hone par prashnchinh he
 Mumbai-based RTI activist Anil Galgali had sought information from the Union Finance Ministry in December 2016 about assurances of financial assistance or development package given to various states by the Modi government
 jisamen yah bhi poocha gaya tha ki jo aashwaasan die gaye the,unamem se kitne puure kiye gaye hai
 However, Finance Ministry Deputy Director Anand Parmar has tried to clarify the situation by giving a roundly answer instead of giving a direct reply to this RTI
 artiai se khulhasartiai kaaryakarta galgali ne kaha ki 18 agast 2015 ko pradhanmantri ne bihar ke liye 1,25,003 karod rupee ke vishesh package kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 But a brief reply by Parmar, a finance ministry official, states that 'projects or tasks will be completed in a sequential manner
 haalanki aaj tak vitt mantralay kii ore se koi paisa jari nahin kiya gaya he
 On the basis of the reply received from the Finance Ministry, Galgali said that it is shameful that this assurance was given to Bihar by none but the Prime Minister of the country, but even after one and a half years, no action has been taken on it
 bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne abhi tak is maamle par kuch nahin kaha he, lekin lalu yadav ne apni anokhi style main modi ko yah salaah di ki pradhanmantri jaise sheersh sanvaidhanik pad par baithe vyakti ko is tarah 'jhooth nahin bolnaa chahie
 Lalu Yadav has targeted PM Modi by sharing a tweet
 lalu yadav ne kaha ki modi ne 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main varanasi ko kioto banane kaa vaada kiya tha, lekin lagbhag teen saal baad unki kalai khul gai he or yah sabit hua he ki unke kahe shabd or vaade keval 'jhooth kaa pulinda' hai
 Senior JDU leader and party spokesperson Neeraj Kumar said that this proves our point that the special package announced by Modi is only 'jumla' and nothing else
 bihar ke shiksha mantri or rajya main congress ke adhyaksh ashok choudhary kaa kahana he ki pradhanmantri ko logon ko kiye gaye vaadon kaa dhyaan rakhana chahie
 He said that the Congress party had suspected the announcement of Modi's special package for Bihar at that time, but PM Modi only has a habit of promising, not to fulfill them
 bihar ke bijepi netaa is mudde par baat nahin karnaa chaahate
 Some of them say that only national leaders can react to this issue
 chunaav ayog par hue taaja hamalon ke bich ayog ne sarkaar se yah adhikaar maanga he ki supreme court or duusare nyaayalayon ke tarj par uske paas bhi avmaananaa kaa adhikaar ho

 isamen ayog ko yah adhikaar dene kii maang he ki agar uske khilaaf pakshpaat karne jaisi apmanjanak tippaniyan ho to use avmaananaa ke notice jari karne or karrwai karne kaa adhikaar ho

 The effects of the war going on in the Gulf and Arab countries are visible to the whole world, but a photographer has created a photo that has caused a sensation on the network

 Syrian citizen this girl is named Adi Hudia and she has seen so many guns at this young age that she herself comes in surrender
 tasviir main jo baccha dikh rahaa he use pehle ladkaa bataaya gaya lekin ab use ladki bataaya ja rahaa he
 Actually the reason for this disturbance is that unless specifically stated, gender is not detected in the word pronoun in the Turkish language
 jab photographer osman sagir ne us bacchee kaa photo khinchne ke liye camera saamne kiya to bacchee ko laga ki use koi hathiyaar dikhaaya ja rahaa he
 On seeing her, the girl immediately raised her hands in fearful surrender

 Just look at her lips, she has pressed them with teeth

 yah puraani siyasat kii sabase badi uljhan he ki uskaa ateet uski chugali khaataa he
 People have so much data on the sour experiences of traditional politics that it does not allow the roots of expectations to solidify
 duusari taraf nai siyasat kii musiibat yah he ki uske paas aisa ateet nahin he jo uske bhavishya ko bharosemand bana sake
 His bangs from above and the rough manner make the way
 dilli metro main safar karte, sadakon par batakahi ko sunate or chunaav surveykshanon ko dhunate hue, mulk kii rajdhani kaa viraat asamanjas samajhnaa mushkil nahin he
 Virat is because Delhi is the largest sample of diversity in the country
 dilli kii uhapoh bijli-pani kii bahason se kahin gahare paithi he
 The expectations of a new governance have started to sting after nine months, and on the other hand, the experience of a 49-day mishap government gives rise to expectations
 sanshay, darasal, puraani siyasat ke saath chalane banaam nai raajnneeti ko ek mauka dene ke bich he, jo chunavi bahason ke bheetar bhid gaya he
 The people of Delhi are going to make the election of a half-hearted state the most exciting battle in the Indian politics, combining this confusion with ideological urges, stories, disillusionments, hopes and experiences
 chunaav ke nateezon par utana achraj nahin hoga jitna ki dilli kii raajnneeti main arvind kejariwal kii vaapasi ko lekar hona chahie
 The Aam Aadmi Party should have become history after 49 days of scattered, fickle and dramatic government
 alpajivi sarkarein nai nahin hai lekin yah kamaumr sarkaar betarah badahavaas thi, jo na to siyasat ko disha de saki or na gavarnence ko
 Movements in democracy have their own dignity and their own code of governance
 kejariwal 49 din ke prayog main donon ko hi nahin saadh sake
 His unsuccessful government has not passed long, but Kejriwal's return to a strong contest is unique
 chunaav surveykshanon ke mutabik agar kejariwal shikshit or aadhunik dilli kii pehali pasand hai to sweekaar karnaa chahie ki kahin kuch or aisa he jo unki 49 din kii sarkaar kii vifaltaa ko dho-ponch rahaa he
 Despite the grand and one-sided mandate in the Lok Sabha, the hope of an alternative to the old politics is still in vain and the same hope is once again in Delhi
 aam aadmi party kii nai raajnneeti kaa chota-sa sarkari tajurba kasaiyla tha lekin nau maah puraani centre sarkaar ke kaamkaaj ne is kasaiylepan ko chhipaane main kejariwal kii madad kii he
 The 2014 Lok Sabha election was a battle for the traditional sultans of politics, but the electorate was new, so the electoral change was actually presented as expectations of a change in governance
 narendra modi bhi siyasat ke usee paaramparik model se nikle hai jisamen congress rachi-basii thi
 The 2014 mandate was against the Congress structure of governance that had aged and failed to yield any results
 lekin baari-bharkam sarkaar, dalbadal or satta ko chuninda haathon main sahejati bijepi, aaj congress jitani hi charbidaar he
 Governance did not change in the first nine months of the new government
 tabhi na to jameen par badlaav dikh rahe hai or na hi doorgaami sujh
 Clearly, the people of Delhi are the immediate neighbors of the central government, so the temperature of disillusionment is high here which is not only helping to forget the 49-day 'kejriwali experiment' failure but also give strength to the aspirations to try new politics
 Used to be
 nai sarkaar se ummiido kii haraarat hi kam nahin hui he, aam aadmi party bhi 49 dinon kii sarkaar ke baad kaaphi badal gai he
 Kejriwal is learning from the experience and getting into the ways of BJP and Congress
 dambh, dabadabe, antarvirodh, dalbadal jo puraani raajnneeti kii pahchaan the, ab aam aadmi party ke paas bhi hai jo ise raajnneeti ke paaramparik maidan ke maahaul main feet karte hai
 They no longer talk of sting operations, hanging the Ambani on the cross, and revolting in the blink of an eye, but have cleverly wrapped up old populist methods in new politics
 phir bhi siyasat main unka nayaa hona hi unki sabase badi takat he
 Just think that Narendra Modi, sitting on a massive public support, could have tried some part of the model of new politics or implemented the urges of transparency
 
 
 kisi vishaal desh ke itihaas main ek rajya ke chunaav chota-sa badlaav hote hai lekin jab nai or puraani raajnneeti ke bich sidhaa muqabla ho to baat badal jaati he
 Goliath had won all his battles thanks to his huge body, heavy armor and long spear
 gulelbaj david se kahin zyada jang jeetne kaa tajurba uske paas tha
 Therefore his confidence was not wrong
 niyam to david ne badal die or pasa palat gaya
 The demands of new politics are changing the game of Delhi and the traditional politics of the BJP seems restless
 yakeenan, dilli ke chunaav kaa nateeja centre sarkaar par koi asar nahin daalega lekin iskaa nateeja loktantr par bada asar jarur chhodega
 In this election, the people of Delhi will not only elect a new government but will also decide whether Delhi is completely with traditional politics or want to invest their faith in any small start-up of new politics
 dilli kaa asamanjas nirnaayak he
 The senselessness of Delhi is not unrestrained, it is something that has a curtain

 yugers ko bataa kar un eps kaa acces instagram se hataa diya jayega or iske baad insta yugers ko apana password badalanaa hoga

 abtak piem modi ko raajnneetik shoman kaa tamgaa dene vaali congress ab rahul gandhi ko bhi upi main ek shoman kii tarah utaarne ja rahi he
 The showmanship, about which Rahul Gandhi himself has been critical of Narendra Modi, himself, like a megastar for the first time on Friday, interacted with activists at the 200-meter ramp at Ramabai Ambedkar Stadium in Lucknow

 On which Rahul Gandhi addressed the workers and then answered their questions

 Most of the activists are excited by this new style of Rahul among Congressmen, and they feel that they should be projected for the next PM post
 lekin kaipurane congressiise team prashanth kishor (pike) kaa naatak qaraar de rahe hai jo zyada lanbaa nahin chal saktaa
 However, this is considered to be Rahul's blistering entry in the UP election camp and many political pundits are eyeing it
 lekin rahul kaa ye mega sho akele congress ko upi main kitna phayda pahunchaa pataa he ye dekhnaa dilachasp hoga

 ruthik roshan kii superhit film koi mil gaya ne 15 saal puure kar liye hai

 Actor playing the role of dwarf magic is Indravadan Purohit
 unhone kai filmon abhinay kiya he
 The artist died on 28 September 2014
 jaadu kaa costum australian artist james kelnar ne taiyaar kiya tha
 Koi mil gaya gave birth to Krrish, and in a weird way playing Rohit gave birth to a newfound strength in himself
 Rohit helped me understand every single thing i went thru as a boy with a stutter
 And made me realize how everything that “is” was simply meant to be
 He helped me understand that strength was not as important as courage
 And that it was ok to have weaknesses
 And that being ok with your weaknesses in itself was courage
 Another beautiful thing he taught me is never to assume what other people are thinking
 He never did
 Never tried to mind read others like we do so often in this age of sms and whatsapp
 Rohit took things at face value or based on evidence
 a good tip for todays gen who should know that u can never really communicate the tone while typing the words
 Today relationships are sometimes at the mercy of how the typed sentence is interpreted
 15 years ago jaadu happened in the theaters and another jaadu in my own life
 So keep going
 Others have said this before, I'm saying it now and you will say it one day looking back at the things that did not make sense
 It’s all going to work out 
 i promise
 On its 15th anniversary, I’m sharing a few of my favorite moments from the film
 i want to thank all the people who were part of this amazing journey
 Especially my dad n mom
 And ofcourse thank you to all of you for the love u gave me

 april main khabar ai thi ki ruthik apane papa rakesh roshan ke saath film 'krish 4' kii shooting jald shuru karenge, lekin is film ko lekar ruthik or unke papa ke bich manmutav ho gaya
 This pique is about the script of the film
 ek akhbaar ne sutara ke hawaale se likhaa tha- 'ruthik ne apane papa ke saath abhi tak chaar filmon- kaho naa pyaar he, koi mil gaya, krish 2 or krish 3 main kaam kiya he
 Now Hrithik has got a little idea about the script
 itane saalon se kaam karte hue unhen cinema kii acchhee jaankaree ho gai he
 He wants his father to make such a film, which the audience was forced to think

 The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) investigation is indicating that the rape of two cousins found dead under mysterious circumstances in Badaun seems to be 'suspicious'
 in hatyaon par may main rashtriya str par janaakrosh hua tha
 After studying the DNA report of Hyderabad's 'center for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics' (CDFD), the CBI has opined that the claim seems suspicious that the girls were raped

 He also said that the report confirms the hidden contradiction in rape
 panel otapsi ke liye do kishori peediton ke shav khod kar nahin nikaal sakaa tha, kyonki jahiraa taur par is sambandh main der se faisla kiya gaya
 Due to the increase in the water level of the Ganges river due to heavy rains, it was not possible to extract the dead bodies for forensic investigation due to the sinking of the graves
 sutron ne kaha ki uske baad panel ne agency se peediton kaa saamaan muhaiyaa karaane ko kaha gaya tha, taaki medical or farensik vishleshan ke liye kuch namoonay liye ja saken
 The board has also visited the crime spot
 jhooth pakadaney vaali mashin se jaanch main aropiyon ke saaf nikalne ke baad andeh kii sui parivaar kii ore ghoomane lagi
 This suspicion was heightened when family members and an eyewitness failed the investigation
 sutron ne kaha ki agency ab ek sthaneey netaa kii bhoomika kii jaanch kar rahi he, jisane kathith taur par paanch aropiyon par hatya kaa dosha lagane ke liye parivaar ko prabhavit kiya
 All the five accused Pappu, Awadhesh and Urvesh (brothers) and soldiers Chhatrapal Yadav and Sarvesh Yadav belong to the same caste
 sutron ne bataaya ki paanch aropiyon- pappu, avadhesh evam urvesh yadav (donon bhai), or consteble chatrapal yadav evam sarvesh yadav - ko jamaanat lene kii ijaajat di jaaegi, kyonki unke khilaaf koi spasht sakshya nahin he
 In the last week of May, the bodies of two cousins were found hanging from a tree in Badaun
 is ghatana par desh bhar main rosh jataayaa gaya tha or kanoon vyavastha ke mudde par rajya kii sapa sarkaar nishane par thi
 Sources said that the agency's suspicion further increased with the family, as the tree from which the bodies were found hanging is about 12 feet tall and near the house of Pappu Yadav, the alleged male friend of the elder sister
 parivaar ke anusaar vah mukhya aaropee he
 Investigators are wondering why a suspect would kill and hang the body from a 12-foot-tall tree near his house
 yah bhi pataa laga ki vah us samay ghar main tha jab kathith taur par ghatana hui
 In addition, if the girls were killed by the accused, they could dispose of the dead bodies instead of hanging them, sources said
 iske alaava us ped se do shavon ko latakaana aasaan nahin tha
 Sources said that the DNA evidence from the CDFD will help the agency to form the basis on which further investigation can be done

 In Samajwadi Party's patron Mulayam Singh Yadav Putramoh, all the wishes of Bhai Shivpal were destroyed
 mulaayam singh ko somvaar ko samaajawaadee party se alag hokar nai party banane kaa elaan karnaa tha, lekin unhone aisa nahin kiya
 Shivpal was trying to teach Akhilesh Yadav the political through Mulayam, but Netaji made such a political bet that Shivpal started hiding
 mulaayam singh yadav aaj lohia trust main press conference karne utre to unke haathon main chaar pej kaa press note tha
 Netaji very neatly removed the first page and kept what was written on the rest of the pages
 jabaki bagal main baithe sharada shukla baar-baar pehla pej padhane ke liye de rahe the, lekin netaji ne use padhaa hi nahin
 Actually, on the first page, the talk of forming a new party was written, of which Mulayam Singh Yadav was going to tell through a press conference
 netaji ne is nai party banane vaale pej ko padhaa hi nahin, balki ulat unhone kaha ki main koi nai party nahin bana rahaa hum
 Not only this, he also avoided the question of choosing one of Akhilesh and Shivpal
 netaji ne jis pej ko padhaa nahin usamen likhaa tha ki "pichley ek saal se lagaataar kisi na kisi kaaran se apamaanit hone ke baavjood party ko ek rakhane kii koshish kii, lekin 23 sitambar (shanivaar) ko pradeshy sammelan main mujhe aamantrit tak nahin karne ke kaaran apamaanit mahasoos kar rahaa hum
 "while the party was founded in the year 1992 by myself
 jo kii yah desh ke samaajawaadee andolan kaa ahm or pramukh bhaag rahaa he
 Respecting the sentiments of the activists of the country, i have decided that a separate political party will be formed along with like-minded people to create a political path
 jisaki ruparekha sheeghra taiyaar kii jaaegi
 No one is raising the voice of farmers, unemployed, Muslims, so i am taking this decision by force
 '' SP spokesman Sunil Sajan said that the socialist ideology and party that Mulayam Singh Yadav raised with his own hands, Akhilesh Yadav to pursue Are doing aise main netaji use apane haathon se kaise kamjor karte
 Netaji has thrown water on the aspirations of all those who were trying to weaken the socialist ideology and the party
 centre sarkaar par chhattisgarh ke siem bhupesh baghel ne aarope lagaaya he ki vah naksali hamale kii jaanch ko roak rahi he
 Baghel said that there was a continuous demand from the Union Home Ministry that the case be transferred to the state government for investigation and the investigation report of the NIA be shared
 gauratlab he ki rashtriya jaanch agency ne 39 logon ko aaropee banaaya tha, lekin jaanch puri hone ke pehle hi band kar di gai
 According to media reports, Bhupesh Baghel said that the Center is not allowing the Jheeram Valley Naxalite attack to be reopened
 ham cese kii dobaaraa jaanch kar naksali hamale kii sajeesh kaa khulaasa karnaa chaahate hai
 Ever since we came into governance, we have been trying to conduct independent investigations as promised
 lekin centre sarkaar lagaataar hamaari maang ko nazarandaaj kar rahi he
 It is worth mentioning that during the Chhattisgarh elections, the Congress had promised that if its government is formed then an independent inquiry will be conducted into the 2013 Jhiram Naxalite attack
 congress kii sarkaar banate hi bastar aiji ke netritv main ek esaiti kaa gathan kiya gaya he
 Mangha Baghel, who has been doing this for four months, said that his government has been contacting the Home Ministry in this regard for the last four months
 hamane centre ko yah bhi bataaya ki kendriya jaanch angency ne bina jaanch puri hue hi ise samaapt kar diya
 Also warned that the NIA did not investigate the murder conspiracy angle
 grih mantralay ne yah kehete hue jaanch saunpane se inkaar kar diya ki aisa karnaa uchit nahin he kyonki jaanch ab bhi jari he
 In such a situation, the SIT constituted by the state government is unable to initiate an investigation
 baghel ne kaha ki cese main nayaa saboot mila he isliye ham dobaaraa jaanch chaahate hai
 The evidence has been destroyed in the last 6 years

 shriramcharitamanas ke anusaar, maharaja janak ne sita ke vivaah hetu swayamvar rachaaya
 When all the kings and emperors who came to Sita's Swayamvara could not lift Lord Shiva's bow, then sage Vishwamitra gave orders to Lord Shri Ram and said - o Ram! Arise, break the bow of Shiva and erase Janaka's anguish
 guru vishwamitra ke vachan sunakar shriram tatpar uthe or dhanush par pratyancha chadhaane ke liye aage badhen
 Seeing this scene, Sita got excited
 prabhu kii ore dekhakar sitaaji ne man hi man nishchay kiya ki yah sharir inhen kaa hokar rahegaa yaa to rahegaa hi nahin
 Lord Shri Ram came to know about the mind of Mother Sita and on seeing it, he raised the great bow of Lord Shiva
 iske baad us par pratyancha chadhaate hi ek bhayankar dhwani ke saath dhanush tut gaya
 Seeing this, Sita's mind was satisfied
 phir sita shriram ke nikat ain
 Janaki came in the midst of the friends, then a friend asked Sita to wear Jayamala
 us samay unke haath aise sushobhit ho rahe the, maano dandionshhit do camel chandramaa ko darate hue jayamala de rahe ho
 Then Sitaji put Jaimala around Sriram's neck
 yah drishy dekhakar devtaa phool barasaane lage
 The instruments started ringing in the city and sky
 shriram-sita kii jodi is prakaar sushobhit ho rahi thi, maano sundarataa or shringaar ras ekatra ho gaye ho
 The fame spread to the earth, hell and heaven that Shriram broke the bow and killed Sita
 isi ke maddenjar prativarsh aghan maas kii shukla panchami ko pramukh ram mandiron main vishesh utsav manaaya jaataa he
 This day is considered very sacred due to the auspicious marriage of Maryada Purushottam Shri Ram and Sita
 bhartiya samskruti main ram-sita adarsh dampatti maane gaye hai
 Just as Prabhu Shriram always attained the position of Purushottam by following his dignity, similarly, Mother Sita presented the supreme example of being a woman of compassion before the whole world
 is paavan din sabhi ko ram-sita kii aradhana karte hue apane sukhi daampaty jivan ke liye prabhu se aashirwad praapt karnaa chahie

 An application was made on behalf of Somnath Bharti that the case be investigated again, which was rejected by the court today
 is maamle mensomnathake saath police ne 17 logon ko aaropee banaaya he
 Somnath Bharti had applied for a second inquiry for a second investigation, which was rejected by the court
 is maamle main dilli police pehle hi apni chargeshit court main daakhil kar chuki he
 Somnath Bharti is currently facing trial in court as an accused in this case
 supreme court ke aadeshke baad ab dilli ke tamaam wo cese jisamen vidhayak or saansad aaropee hai, usamen ek saal ke bheetar court ko sunwaayee puri karke apana faisla sunaanaa he
 Since March 1, the Supreme Court has not only set up special courts in all matters related to mlas and mps, but has also fixed a time limit of 1 year for their hearing
 iskaa arth yah he ki somnath bharti se jude is maamle main court apana faisla 1 saal main suna degaa jisase yah tay ho jayega ki african mahilaon dwaralagaaye gaye aropashi the yaa nahin or court se somnath bharti ko koi raahat milegi yaa nahin

 ve aksar videshi netaaon se mulaakaat ke dauraan charchaa main rahete hai
 Some time ago he came into the limelight during his first official meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel at the White House when he refused to join hands with Angela Merkel

 And just as social media had heavily redeemed the previous story, similarly this story was immediately caught sight of social media and it was fiercely discussed

 Actors Karan Patel and Karanvir Bohra arrived with their wives at this Diwali party
 tivi queen ekta kapur, actress karishma tanna or neelam
 Team of serial 'yeh Hai Mohabbatein'
 kishwar marchent or 'nagin' fame adaa khan
 Actor Jai with his wife and cast of serial 'two and a half kilo love'
 bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ke sadsy, chaahe ve varisht netaa hon yaa jamini kaaryakarta yaa phir pradhanmantri narendra modi, koi bhi loksabhaa chunaav main party ke chamakdaar pradarshan kaa shrey apane vaicharik matra sanghathan aresas ko dene main nahin hichakataa
 However, in public perception, this organization is at the bottom of the saffron party's electoral success story
 ab jab chunaav nateezon ko teen maheene biit chuke hai or siyaasi dhul baith chuki he, desh kaa mizaaj janamat surveykshan ke nattejey bataa rahe hai ki bijepi kii jeet main aresas or yahaan tak ki rajnath singh tathaa amit shah jaise sheersh netaaon kii bhoomika bhi behad maamuli rahi thi
 Only two percent of the people participating in the survey believe that the credit for this victory should be given to the RSS
 yah rajnath or shah, donon ko mili teen fisadi shrey se bhi kam he
 People are also not willing to share the victory in the huge army of BJP workers because only five per cent of the people are giving credit to the workers
 duusari ore 64 fisadi logon ne akele modi ko jeet kaa shrey diya he, jinhone chunaav se saal bhar pehle apana or apni party kaa chunaav prachaar shuru kiya tha or baad main jinhen party kii ore se pradhanmantri pad kaa aupchaarik ummidavaar banaaya gaya
 Contrary to the perception of Modi's political opponents, only 12 per cent believe that the new Prime Minister will be controlled by the RSS
 isaki bajaae 47 fisadi kaa maananaa he ki khud modi apni hi raah par chalenge
 Apart from this, 31 per cent believe that Modi will be able to handle any kind of conflict with the Sangh Parivar well and he will also be able to balance with the Sangh Parivar on controversial issues
 bijepi kii jeet kaa shrey jitne logon ne aresas yaa bijepi kader ko diya, usase kahin zyada 9 fisadi log maanate hai ki isaki vajah 'upie kii naakaami’ thi
 This fact supports the analysis of bjp's senior leader LK Advani on the mandate, who said that the perception that the Congress-led upa's failure was responsible for the bjp's success
 modi main janata ke vishwaas kaa ek or saboot yah tathy he ki jo log maanate hai ki shah ko party kaa adhyaksh nahin banaaya janaa chahie tha kyonki unke khilaaf aapraadhik mukademe lambit hai, unki taadaad behad kam he
 Only 12 per cent believe that Shah should not have been made the president of the BJP, while 20 per cent consider it as a good move to strengthen Modi's hold on the party
 iske alaava survey main shaamil 32 fisadi logon kaa maananaa he ki shah bijepi ko nai oonchaaiyon par le jaaenge
 An interesting fact has emerged that in the opinion of 48 percent of the people surveyed, Modi has made his ministers 'irrelevant', but 37 percent do not believe so
 logon ko agar aisa lag rahaa he ki modi ne apane mantriyon ko 'apraasangik’ bana daalaa he, to isaki ek vajah mantriyon ke nijee sachivon kii niyukti ke maamle main unki ore se lagaai gai bandishen ho sakati hai
 In fact, Modi cabinet ministers were banned from making personal secretaries of those who worked as personal staff of UPA ministers
 is niyam ke kaaran na sirf rajnath singh ko sharmindagi kaa saamana karnaa padaa balki isane arun jetali ke liye bhi dikkat paidaa kar di
 He exempted this rule by saying that his personal staff during his tenure as Leader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha should not be made a victim of this decree
 prashasan par modi ke niyantran kii sabase chaunkaane vaali misaal yah he ki vishisht niyuktiyon ke maamle main grih mantri kii raay koi myne nahin rakhti
 However, he is a member of the Committee on Appointments of the Cabinet
 ab zyaadaatar niyuktiyon ko piemo se manjuuri di ja rahi he or rajnath ko isaki ghoshnaa hone ke baad bas aupchaarikta kii ek muhar lagaani hoti he
 According to political analysts, since the general perception among the people is that the BJP has got so many votes in the elections due to Modi, they are getting the freedom to run the government according to their mind and no pressure of the party organization can work
 Used to be
 yah baat modi ke unke mantriyon ke chayan, mantriyon ke nijee staff par lagaai gai bandishon, rajyapalon ko badalane ke kadamon or khandaani rajnatik viraasat vaale varisht netaaon ke saamne na jhukne main saaf dekhi ja sakati he
 Such leaders include former party president Murali Manohar Joshi, who is currently sitting on the sidelines because he is elderly
 isi tarah bhartiya janata yuva morcha ke adhyaksh anuraag thakur ko bhi sarkaar se isliye baahar rakhaa gaya he kyonki ve ek purv mukhyamantri ke bete hai
 From the point of view of the results of the survey, the mood of the country which has confirmed the popularity of Modi, it seems that these leaders have done sensible work by not questioning being kept out of the government
 yahaan tak ki aresas bhi takneekee taur par modi ke is adhikaar kshetra main taang adaane se bachataa rahaa he jisane atal bihari vaajapeyi kii sarkaar main khulkar apni pasand ke vitt mantri kaa naam sujiya tha
 78 per cent of the people surveyed said that the cabinet that Modi has created is good
 pradhanmantri rajnatik niyuktiyon ke maamle main bhi kaaphi satark hai taaki un par bhai-bhatijawad kaa aarope na lagane paae
 If sources are to be believed, Modi made it clear in his initial cabinet meetings that ministers would not make political appointments in their ministries unilaterally
 isaki bajaae unhone mantriyon se kaha ki ve apane tahat aane vaale khaali siyaasi padon kii ek suchi taiyaar karen jis par party sanghathan kii ore se upyukt ummidavaaron ke naam sujhaaye jaaenge
 Among all this, Modi has not forgotten that his association with the public has its own importance
 jin rajyon main chunaav hone hai, vahaan pariyojnaon ke udghaatan ke liye unhone jahaan vakt nikaala he, vahiin unhone yah vyavastha bhi kii he ki unka ek mantri har roj party karyaalay main party kaaryakartaaon kii shikayaton ko sunne ke liye maujuud rahegaa
 The task of creating this system is that of Amit Shah, who has developed a system in which the names of the ministers who will be present daily in the party office to address the grievances
 modi ke suzav sirf suzav nahin hote, unhen party or unke mantri farmaan kii tarah le rahe hai
 Right now the showman of the BJP is running the show till now

 NIA ne kaha he ki NDA ke satta main aane ke baad se yani 2014 se is maamle main kisi bhi aaropee ko zamaanat nahin mili he
 Earlier, the NIA had said in court that the allegations of slowing down the trial of the case were false
 halafname main kaha gaya ki is maamle ki pairvi kar rahi NIA kii purv vakil rohinee salion ke aarope bebuniyaad he ki unke upar dabaav daalaa gaya ki wo is aropiyon ko lekar naram ravaiya apanaae yaa phir cese ko kamazor karen
 The NIA, in its affidavit, also said that the allegation of former NIA lawyer Rohini Salian that all the orders were in favor of NIA when she was special counsel in the case
 jaanch agency ne supreme court ko bataaya ki 14 aropiyon main se 4 ko 2011 or 2013 ke bich zamaanat mil gai thi
 That too when Rohini was leading the case in the Bombay High Court
 jaanch agency ne ye halafanama un do yachikaaon ke jawaab main diya he, jisamen ye maang ki gai thi ki enie kii purv vakil rohinee salion ke aaropon kii jaanch CBI yaa phir SIT se karai jaae
 Also, special counsel should be appointed for the NIA in this case, so that a fair trial can be held in the case

 The Narendra Modi government on Wednesday presented a CAG report in the Rajya Sabha regarding the Rafale deal
 sieji report ko kendriya mantri pi
 Radhakrishnan placed in the House
 report ke mutabik modi sarkaar ne jo rafel deal kii he vah upie sarkaar se 2
 86 percent cheaper
 haalanki, report modi sarkaar ke us daawey ko puri tarah se khaarij karti he jiske tahat kaha ja rahaa tha ki upie sarkaar se 9 fisadi sasti he
 After the CAG report, a political battle has started on this
 congress ne CAG report par sawaal khadey kiye hai to vahiin arun jetali ne ise satya kii jeet bataaya
 Congress MP Pradeep Bhattacharya questioned the CAG report on the Rafale Deal case, saying that no information has been given about the price of Rafale in this report, it seems that this report has been made under pressure from the government
 Satyameva Jayate” – the truth shall prevail
 The CAG Report on Rafale reaffirms the dictum
 — Arun Jaitley (@arunjaitley)february 13, 2019vahiin, arun jetali ne ise sarkaar kii jeet bataate hue kaha ki sieji report se sach saamne aa gaya he
 Jaitley wrote on Twitter- Satyamev Jayate
 aakhirkaar sach saamne aayaa
 He has said that the Maha Lijbandhan has been exposed after the CAG report came out
 Rafale story unfolds
 At the end of Chapter 4, what do we have? a costlier aircraft and a longer delivery period! - p
 Chidambaram (@pchidambaram_in)february 13, 2019sieji report par purv kendriya mantri pi chidambaram ne modi sarkaar par jamkar hamalaa kiya or kaha ki hamaare aarope sahi sabit ho gaye hai
 The CAG report neither mentions any bank guarantee nor is it an account
 modi sarkaar ne ek mahangaa vimaan kharida or lambii delivery avadhi
 Calling the Prime Minister a thief is against the dignity of Parliament- Gadkari, Union Minister Nitin Gadkari said that after the CAG report it is clear that our deal is better than the UPA deal
 congress ko piem par hamale karne se bachanaa chahie
 Union Minister Nitin Gadkari said in a special conversation with Aaj Tak on the CAG report that the Supreme Court has also made it clear
 jo baaten kahi ja rahi thi use sieji ne bhi apni report main spasht kar diya he
 There is no corruption in the deal
 hamaare desh kii suraksha bahut mahatvapurn he
 In such a situation when the country does not have a single fighter jet, in such a situation, the important subjects of our country should not be politically reasoned
 unhone kaha ki jab supreme court ne baat kah di to yah vishay samaapt ho janaa chahie
 Even after this report given by the CAG, this subject should be finished
 unhone kaha ki ab congress ko is vishay ko desh hit main khatm kar dena chahie
 He said that after the decision of the Supreme Court, there is no question of creating JPC
 ab sieji kii report bhi aa ai he ki ham kisi sanstha ke swaittata par sawaal nahin uthaa sakate hai
 To call a person like the Prime Minister a thief is against the dignity of Parliament
 raajnneeti main mat bhinnata ho sakati he
 Party politics may be different
 pradhanmantri kisi party ke nahin desh ke netaa hote hai
 The Prime Minister should talk in a respectful manner
 islam virdohi film 'inosense of muslims' ke nirmaataa kii hatya parapakistan sarkarmen rail mantri gulam ahamed bilaur ne ek lakh dollar (53 lakh 25 hajaar rupee) kaa inaam rakhaa he
 Ahmed said that the person who will kill the maker of the anti-islam film will be given this award
 unhone kaha ki ishanindakon ko daraane ke liye film banane vaale ko maarane ke sivaa or koi rasta nahin he
 Violence against the anti-islam film also prompted support from the banned militant group Taliban and Al Qaeda
 unhone kaha ki agar in sanghathanon ke log ishaninda karne vaali film banane vaale ko maarthe hai to unhen bhi inam diya jayega
 Bilour's remarks come at a time when 23 people have been killed and property worth billions of rupees has been destroyed in the violence against the anti-islam film in Pakistan

 bijepi netaa susheel kumaar modi pichley 15 dinon se rashtriya janata dal supremeo lalu prasad or unke parivaar waalon par karodon kii benami sampatti arjeet karne ko lekar khulaase dar khulaase kar rahe hai
 Sushil Modi has also presented concrete documents about how Lalu deposited benami property through fake companies
 isi kram main susheel modi ne mangalvaar ko ek or khulaasa kiya jisamen unhone bataaya ki aakhir lalu or unke parivaar ne benami sampatti kis tareeke se arjeet kii or kaise lalu ke paas aaj takreeban 1000 karod kii benami sampatti he? jaaniye susheel modi kii jubaani lalu or unke parivaar kii benami sampatti arjeet karne kii kahani
 1
 2006 main sharaab mafia om prakaash katyaal ne AK Infosystems Pvt Ltd naam kii ek company kholi jiskaa mukhya uddeshylaluor unke parivaar waalon ke liye benami sampatti jamaa karnaa tha

 4
 4 saalon ke baad, AK INFOSYSTEMS ne yah jameen tejasvi or tej pratap se kharid lee or iske liye donon bhaaiyon ko 70 lakh par chukaaye gaye
 The two brothers also got 70 lakh rupees of the land gifted in this way and a company named AK Infosystems became the owner of this land
 5
 In 2014, the Katyal family, which had opened a company called AK Infosystems Pvt Ltd, broke away from the company and all the shares of this company were transferred in the name of Sharelu and his family
 is samay rabari devi kii is company main 85 fisadi or tejasvi 15 fisadi share ke maalik he jabaki lalu kii do betiyaan chanda or raagini is company main keval do nideshak he

 susheel modi ne aarope lagaaya ki 2000 se 2005 ke bich jab rabari devi mukhyamantri thi to us vakt katyaal parivaar ne patna ke betaa ilaake main sharaab kii factory kholi thi or iske badale katyaal parivaar ne farji company kholi or lalu and family ke liye benami sampatti arjeet karne laga
 According to Modi, Lalu has benami assets worth about 1000 crores to this day
 modi ne maang kii he ki mukhyamantri nitish kumaar lalu kii is benami sampatti kaa sangyaan le or unke khilaaf jaanch shuru karavaaen
 Modi said that if this does not happen, he will complain to the Income Tax Department, Enforcement Directorate and CBI regarding this matter
 amuman aapas main jhagad rahe pati-patni jab yah sanket dena chahen ki unka rishta ab kis ore bad rahaa he, to kya karte hai? yaa to ve ek-duusare ko chocolate bhejte hai or ek-duusare ko whatsap imoji bhejkar sanket dete hai ki ve ek duusare kaa chumban karke samjhaute kii ore baduya chaahate hai
 Or their differences deepen over time and they formally turn to the court to separate from each other

 Narendra Modi was sworn in as Prime Minister for a second term that the next day on 31 May, US President Donald Trump spoiled his fun
 trump ne ghoshnaa kii ki ve america ke janaralined system of priference (jiespi) ke tahat bharat ko praapt tarjihi daron ko waapas lene ke apane aadesh ke saath aage bad rahe hai
 The reason? The Modi government did not "assure America that India would provide its equitable and fair access to its markets
" ''bharat 1976 se hi america ke jiespi ke tahat tarjeeh paata rahaa he
 In 2018, 12 percent of goods exported to India i
e
 6
 3 arab dollar kaa laabh mila tha
 Although the duty concessions received under this amounted to only $ 240 million last year, the withdrawal of GSP privileges, effective from June 5, would hit exports of around 1,900 products to India
 trump kii is karrwai ke ek pakhwaade baad 15 june ko, bharat ne jawaab main america se aayaat hone vaale 29 saamaan par ucch shulk jad diya jisamen seb, baadaam, akhrot, chhole, masoor or boric acid shaamil the
 For example, the customs duty on almonds was increased by 20 percent
 pichley saal, bharat ne 54
 Bought almonds worth $ 30 million
 yah america ke kul baadaam niryaat kaa aadha he
 This means that this tariff increase will harm American almond growers
 vastav main, bharat ne june 2018 main in utpaadon par ucch karon kii ghoshnaa kii kyonki america ne bharat ke steel par shulk main 25 pratishat or aluminium aayaat ke liye 10 pratishat shulk badha diya tha
 But India did not take any action on the tariff hike as it hoped to resolve the differences through negotiations
 is bich, bharat tarriff mandandon kaa ulanghan karne ke liye america ko vishwa vyapaar sanghathan (dablutio) ke vivaad niptaan nikaay main lekar gaya
 There was no tension between the two countries only on the business front
 pichley do varshon main, iran se bharat ke tel aayaat, rus se raksha kharid, bharatiyon ke liye america work vija jari karne or modi sarkaar kii prastaavit nai i-commers niti jaisi kai muddon par donon ke bich vivaad paidaa hue hai
 Regarding the e-commerce policy, the US argues that this has been done to damage American giants like Amazon, Walmart and Google (see deadlock issues)
 mumbai main linkan house kii bikri jaise kuch anya mudde bhi hai jinako sulajhaaye jane kii jarurat he
 Lincoln House was leased to the US Consulate decades ago
 jab 2015 main duutavas ne ise 750 karod rupye main ek pramukh bhartiya udyogpati ko bechnaa chaha, to centre sarkaar ne aapatti jataai or ab tak bikri ko manjuuri nahin di he
 Ironically, all this is happening when the two countries have come closer to each other on strategic issues such as defense, terrorism, maritime regulations and US engagement with the South Asian region
 lekin donon desh apane rishte main khatas ke badale mithaas gholne ko taiyaar hai, yah america videsh mantri mike pompiyo kii nae videsh mantri es
 This is evident from the meeting with Jaishankar and again, with Modi on 26 June
 jaisaa ki india today ke saath khaas baatcheet main pompiyo ne bataaya, ''hamane is bare main baat kii ki ham is daur, is samay ko kaise alag bana sakate hai
 We can be more ambitious in our relationship
 ham vyapaar, sainya, raksha sahyog ke muddon ke sakaaratmak pahaluon par gaur kar sakate hai
 The commitment is real
 yah gahari samaj he ki kaise hamaare desh saath kaam kar sakate hai
 Today, the bottom line of my conversation with the leadership here is that for the good of the people of our two countries, this region and the world as a whole, America and India need to remain good partners
 ham bharat se labhanvit honge or bharat hamase
 "(see conversation," a country cannot get everything it wants ") Jaishankar also confirmed the positive atmosphere in the conversation
 unhone kaha, ''kuch puraane muddon, khaskar vyapaar se jude muddon par, meraa aagrah tha ki ham rachanaatmak or vyaavhaarik drushtikon apanaaen
 It is natural that when you are doing business, there will be some disputes in it as well and i think the real test of our intention is with our ability to address those disputes effectively
 '' usee raat, modi ji-20 shikhar sammelan main bhaag lene ke liye japan ke osaka ravaanaa hue, jahaan trump ke saath unki dwipaksheeya baithak honi he jisamen gatirodhon ko dur karne ke vishay main baatcheet hogi
 But, given the many topics of mutual dispute between the two countries, it would not be enough to embrace the two leaders, it would require a more open heart than that
 to shuruaati vaadon ke baavjood duniya ke sabase bade loktantr or duniya ke sabase shaktishaalee desh ke bich ke aapasi sambandhon main khatas ke aise daur kyon aate hai? or rishton ko waapas sahaj karne ke liye kya karnaa hoga?gaayab hoti garmjoshiie sabase pehle yah samajhen ki aakhir gadabad hui kaise
 When Trump took over as president in January 2017, indo-us relations had been a very sweet affair for over a decade and the two countries had become each other's 'strategic partners'
 donon deshon ke bich oonch-neech vaale sambandhon main nayaa mode tab aayaa tha jab aktubar 2008 main raashtrapati jorge dablyoo
 Bush and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh signed the indo-us civil nuclear deal
 usase bharat ko parmaanu urja or technology kii aapurti par lage pratibandhon ke hatane kii raah khuli, jo badi pashchimi mahashaktiyon ne bharat ke 1974 or 1998 main parmaanu pareekshanon ke baad laga rakhi thi
 This also removed the huge bottleneck in the relationship between India and America
 tab se donon deshon ke bich vyapaar kaa graph chadhgaye laga, jo pehle bharat main ek purv america rajdoot ke mutabik ''chapatti jaisaa sapaat'' hua karata tha
 Last year, trade touched $ 142 billion
 is saal america ne phir bharat ke vyapaar saajheedaar ke maamle main china ko peeche chhod diya
 The sale of high US defense equipment to India also opened up after the nuclear deal
 2008 se america se kul kharid ab 20 arab dollar par pahunch gai he
 When Modi came to power in 2014, he quickly formed a friendly relationship with Barack Obama and took steps towards taking the relationship of the two countries forward
 8 june, 2016 ko america sansad ke sanyukt satr ko sambodhit karte samay unhone kaha tha ki donon desh aakhirkaar ''itihaas kii jhijak todgaye main kaamyaab'' ho gaye
 During his election campaign, Trump showed a positive attitude towards India and said that he is the "big fan" of that country and "we are going to be good friends"
 '' trump ne uske baad modi ko ''bharat kaa mahaan pradhanmantri or vikaas-samarthak netaa bataaya
 "india, however, has been very cautious about Trump as he promised to keep American interests paramount and to overturn the existing world order to achieve that goal
" ek bhartiya visheshgy trump siddhant ko teen 'di' ke rup main abhivyakt karte hai: disingez (rishte todo), digloblise (vaishvikaran badalo) or diserpt (todfod karo)
 With Trump raising pangs, India initially followed the Look and Wait policy and decided that until the Trump administration moved forward, be silent
 satta sanbhaalane ke din se hi trump ne sanket de die the ki ve apane abhiyaan ko aage lekar jaaenge
 He separated the US from the proposed trade agreement between the 12 countries, calling the trans-pacific Partnership a "bad deal"
 phir unhone iran se parmaanu qaraar ko radd kar diya, jise obama ne sanyukt vyapak kaary yojana (jecipioe) ke tahat iran or pi-5+1 (sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad ke paanch sthaayee sadasyon—america, china, france, britain or britain ke alaava germany) deshon ke saath anjaam diya tha
 He called the Paris Climate Change Treaty meaningless and declared that the US would not honor its commitments under it
 uske baad unhone china ke saath khuleam vyapaar yuddh ched diya
 China had a favorable trade balance of $ 419 billion with the US in 2018
 trump ne uttar atlantic sandhi sanghathan (nato) ke saajheedaaron ko bhi jhatka diya or kaha ki nato ke kharch sabhi barabari se uthaaen
 In June 2017, when Trump first met Modi at the White House, it seemed that there was a sweetness between the two and the US President said that he considered India a "true friend" and Modi embraced him
 Had gone
 donon ke bich sabhi pramukh muddon—raksha, vyapaar, suraksha or bahupaksheeya sambandhon ko vistaar dene kii baat hui lekin trump ne kaha, ''aapke bazaar main america vastuon ke niryaat ke raste main khadey avarodhon ko hataaya janaa jaruri he taaki ham aapke desh ke saath vyapaar ghate ko kam karen
 "this was not said lightly
 lekin nai dilli ne galatfahami main yah maan liya tha ki trump china ke saath apane 400 arab dollar ke vyapaar ghate ke mukaable bharat ke saath mahaj 24 arab dollar ke vyapaar ghate ko zyada tarjeeh nahin denge
 Says an expert on indo-us relations, "for Trump, business is from first to fifth place on their priority list and they are not willing to budge on it
" bhartiya adhikari is vaastaviktaa se talmail nahin bitha paae or unhen is baat kaa ehsaas nahin tha ki ve trump ke pehle ke raashtrapatiyon kii baton ko jis tarah bahut gambhirtha se nahin lete rahe hai, vah ranneeti trump ke saath nahin chalane vaali
 "it was not entirely India's fault in a bizarre duel
" trump prashasan ne bharat ke saath apane sambandhon ko ek ajeeb dwandv ke saath chalaaya he, jisane bhartiya niti-nirmaataaon ko yah vishwaas dilaayaa ki ve america raashtrapati ke saath usee tarah se aage bad sakate hai jaisaa ki obama ke daur main chalata rahaa
 Trump kept shouting at the trade front with India but when it came to defense procurement, he gave India the status of Strategic Trade Authorization Tier One or STA-1
 isane america hathiyaar nirmaataaon ko bharat ko us takanic ko bechney kii anumati di jo america ne ab tak apane kuch nikatatam sahyogiyon ko bhi nahin di thi
 "the Donald Trump administration has had a cynical view of the relationship with India," says Ashley Tellis, senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace
 yah bharat ke saath ranneetik aayam par kaam karnaa chahta he jaisaa ki bush or obama ne kiya tha lekin duusari ore, yah bharat ko ek vyapaar pratispardhi ke rup main dekhtaa he
 The previous governments had found ways to balance their strategic interests with India for their economic interests
 trump prashasan bharat ko america ke liye ek aarthik samasya ke rup main maanate hue uske saath ranneetik sambandhon kaa laabh lenaa chahta he
 India was not ready to move fast on the decision to grant the concessions Trump was seeking, and the US President publicly expressed his anger in February 2018
 unhone kaha, ''aap bharat ko dekhen, pradhanmantri modi mere bahut achche dost hai lekin aap ek najar daalen to pataa chalegaa ki unhone america motorcycle (aayaat) par 100 pratishat kar lagaaya he
 We do not charge them
 or jab harley (davidson) apni motorbike vahaan bhejtaa he, to ve us par 100 pratishat kar laga dete hai
 They also make a large number of motorcycles and send them to us, but we do not charge them
 maine unhen (modi) phone kiya
 i said, it won't do
 unhone ek phone kol par kar ko 50 pratishat tak kam kar diya
 i said, this is also unacceptable because if we don't take any tax from you then why would you take 50 percent
 '' baad main, white house kii ek aantarik report main saamne aayaa ki shulk lagane vaale deshon main bharat sabase upar he to trump ne bharat ko ''ek tarriff king'' bataaya
 India angered America more when the Modi government in its first term decided to control the prices of medical devices imported from the US, especially stents
 bharat main to is par khushi jaahir kii gai lekin america nirmaataa isse sabase adhik naakhush the
 He called this price control mechanism unfair and expressed his inability to trade
 kaha gaya ki isse bharat main america ke pratyaksh videshi nivesh main giravat aegi kyonki sarkaar apratyaashit niyam lagu kar rahi he
 But India did not agree to back down even after long negotiations to remove price controls
 unki naaraazgi tab or bad gai jab bharat ne ividi (in-vitro diagnosticks) riegents par 30 pratishat seemaa shulk lagane kaa faisla kiya
 India imports these reactants worth more than Rs 6,000 crore annually, of which American companies account for 36 per cent
 deyari kshetra main, bharat ne america doodh or dugdh utpaadon ke niryaat kii anumati se inkaar kar diya, basharte america companiyaan yah pramanit nahin karatin ki ''dudharu pashuon ko aahaar ke rup main aantarik angon, rakt vaale bhojan or jugalee mul ke utak nahin die gaye hai
 The Union Commerce Ministry's stance was clear that no special exemption would be granted to American exporters as it linked religious sentiments to the public
 is bich, america sarkaar ne yah bhi maang kii ki bharat smart watch, mobile phone or telecom network upkaran sahit saat tarriff linon par daren kam kare
 India argued that this could not be done because of the requirements for domestic manufacturers to create an equal trade environment
 in vastuon par 20 pratishat aayaat shulk se bharat ko salanaa 3
 Revenue of $ 2 billion is received
 nai dilli ke rukh se washington spasht rup se niraash tha or ek vyapaar adhikari ne tippanee kii, ''bahut kuch aisa tha jise saaf kiya ja saktaa tha
 Small things could be solved easily
 ab khatra is baat kaa paidaa ho gaya he ki aag bhadak jaaegi or puure rishte ko khatm kar degi
 Unreasonable accusations The Commerce Ministry of India, however, justifies its stand saying that the US is trying to dominate India unfairly
 2017 main jabase trump ne kaarybhaar sambhala he, vyapaar ghaataa 3 arab dollar se adhik gir gaya he
 Officials say that the supply of US arms to India has been steadily increasing and an average turnover of $ 2 billion a year does not figure in trade figures
 agle paanch varshon main, bharat 25 arab dollar ke hathiyaar saude karne vaala he, jise bharat keval america vimaanon kii kharid ke liye hastakshar karnaa chahta he (dekhen, sainya kharidari kii suchi)
 Then the US is not even counting the import of many items that India imports from other countries and in which huge quantities of American ingredients are used which indirectly benefits the US economy
 iske alaava, 1,80,000 se adhik bhartiya chaatr america vishvavidhyalayon main adhyayan karne ke liye har saal vahaan jate hai or salanaa 10 arab dollar se adhik kharch karte hai
 That too is not counted in the bilateral balance sheet
 bharat kaa kahana he ki vah maal par jo shulk lagaataa he, use rajasav utpann karne kii deshon kii kshamta ke aadhaar par dablutio kaa anumodan praapt he
 And India had made concessions on many IPR (intellectual property rights) issues that Western countries wanted
 america ke saath baatcheet se niraash ek adhikari kehete hai, ''america har cheez main apni jeet chahta he
 They have only a $ 20 billion trade deficit with us, compared to the US $ 400 billion trade deficit with China and they try to wring our arm on everything
 yah sanak he
 And the way they are carrying things, no country has any sympathy for the Americans
 ''keval vyapaar hi khatas paidaa karne kaa mudda nahin he
 India also suffered the brunt of US sanctions on any country doing business with Iran
 bharat ke kul tel aayaat kaa 10 pratishat iran se aata he or vaikalpik strot milane tak america ne dilli ke liye chah maheene kii chhot di thi
 Last month, the US abolished all such exemptions, forcing India to take oil from other countries at higher prices
 jab pompiyo dilli main the, tab jaishankar ne bharat kii urja jaruraton ko rekhaankit kiya kyonki bharat apni urja jaruraton kaa 80 pratishat aayaat se puraa karata he
 The second major cause for controversy is India's arms imports from Russia, especially the S-400 missile deal in October last year
 idhar, america ne rus se hathiyaar kharidne vaale desh par bhi pratibandh laga diya he
 It has threatened that the US will not sell its advanced weapons to a country defying the US embargo
 bharat is saude ko radd karne se inkaar kar rahaa tha kyonki rus ke saath uske puraane sambandh hai or bharat ne america raashtrapati se in pratibandhon par chhot maangi he
 Poquipayo was not willing to make any promises in this matter during his visit, but there are indications that it may be exempted if India gives the US a concession in other things
 bharat apni taraf se america ke bahut kareeb jane ko utsuk nahin dikhataa
 The biggest reason for this is that Modi believes that the world will be multipolar in emerging international scenarios and that India has an advantage in maintaining friendship with every pole
 iske liye bharat ko kuch ke saath sambandh behatar karne honge lekin kisi ke saath sambandh kharaab bhi na hone paae, yah bhi dekhnaa hoga
 The United States wants India to join China in its trade war, but New Delhi's policy is clear that its relationship with Beijing will be defined at its level
 haalanki, washington ko is baat se bhi chidh he ki modi sarkaar china ke saath apane vivaadon ko sulajhane ke liye to aage badhkar prayaas kar rahi he lekin america maangon par vichaar karne main bharat waisi tatparta nahin dikhaata
 The positive side of the relationship is that the Trump administration strongly supported India's concerns over terror from Pakistan and warned Islamabad that it would not tolerate cross-border attacks
 gauratlab he ki balakot hamalon ke vakt america ne bharat ke rukh kaa samarthan kiya tha
 The e-commerce ghost has raised American concerns about India's recently drafted e-commerce policy
 america ne chini doorsanchaar diggaj huaave ke saath bharat ke vyapaar par naaraazgi jataai he kyonki huvei par america ne suraksha kaarnon se pratibandh lagaaya he
 Pompeo knew that there were many issues of dispute between the two countries and both countries needed to engage in meaningful strategic relations with a far-reaching view
 unhone kaha, ''hamaare donon deshon ke bich bade aarthik sambandh hai
 And the two countries whose relations are so deep, strong and so economically connected as we have, sometimes have small hiccups, but there are ways to remove those hurdles
 philhal ham us par kaam kar rahe hai or ham unhen sulajhaayenge
 Modi has also brought in an expert to deal with the US by appointing former foreign secretary Jaishankar as foreign minister
 pompiyo ke saath baatcheet main donon aise samaadhaan ke saath aa sakate hai jo donon deshon ke liye ek jeet hogi
 As Telis states, "trump wants satisfaction on certain issues
" ab sawaal yah he ki bharat ke liye unki ichchhaaon ko puraa karnaa vastav main kitna mushkil he? mujhe lagata he ki agar vishisht muddon ko hal karne ke liye or america ke saath apane rishte madhur rakhane ke liye agar bharat ko kuch kadam peeche hatana padataa he, to bhi yah bharat ke liye ek bura nivesh nahin hoga
 Pompeo's efforts reflect positivity in the negotiations and America's eagerness to enhance its strategic relationship with India has been reiterated
 ek varisht bhartiya rajanyik, jo baithkon main shaamil the, ne dekha, ''pompiyo sauhardrapurn vaarta kii ore bad rahe the or unhone haaavee hone kaa kabhi bhi koi sanket nahin diya
 The great thing is that the US has said that the relationship with India is important for it
 bharat main ek majboot sarkaar he
 The country is on a good development path and whose interests are similar to the interests of the American people
 unamem milakar kaam karne kii teevr ichha dikhi
 "maybe that's it
" pompiyo kii yatra ne ji-20 shikhar sammelan ke avasar par modi or trump ke bich dwipaksheeya baithak kii jameen taiyaar kii he
 It will take a lot of hard work and a lot of bargaining to get it right
 lekin acchhee baat yah he ki bharat or america ek-duusare ke saath sir takaraane kii jagah haath milaane ko variyata de rahe hai or apane vivaad sulajhane ke tareeke nikaal rahe hai

 This is a photoshopped photo that has been used as a thumbnail picture in a viral video
 lata mangeshkar kii asli photo unki bahan or gayika aashaa bhosle ke saath he jo 2013 menmediamein prakashit ho chuki he
 We found a video published on India TV on November 14, 2013, after photoshopped by photoshopping a photo group of photoshoots by Photolata Mangeshkar by putting the words "lata Mangeshkar praising" on youtube is video kaa capshan he “lata mangeshkar ne sachin tendulkar ko apana betaa bataate hue unki tarif kii”

 After listening carefully to both the videos below, one can understand that the word "sachinji" uttered by Lata Mangeshkar has been blown out of the viral video
 iske alaava viral video main lata kii jis cliping kaa istemaal kiya gaya he, usase bhi chhedchhad kii gai he
 No reliable news has ever been found with the edited video original video ranu, which suggests that Lata Mangeshkar met Ranu Mandal and praised Ranu
 hamane lata mangeshkar ke daftar main bhi baat kii
 His office completely rejected the viral video claim that Lata Mangeshkar had met Ranu Mandal
 nishkarshlata mangeshkar kii ranu mandal se kabhi mulaakaat nahin hui, na hi unhone saarvajanik taur par ranu kii kabhi tarif hi kii
 While blessing Ranu, Lata's photo has been created through Photoshop
 video main lata mangeshkar kii jis cliping kaa istemaal he, usase bhi chhedchhad kii gai he
 Thus all claims made in this video are false

 IPL Fever is on the skin like every year across the country and perhaps viewers do not want to search for entertainment bigger than this
 yahaan tak ki jo filmein IPL se pehle relies huin or jinka box offis collection kaa graph shandaar rahaa un filmon kii kamai main bhi IPL ke aagaaj ke baad giravat dekhne ko mili he

 behtareen lav story hone ke baavjood ipl kii vajah se box offis par film kaa collection vaisaa nahin rahaa jitne kii ummid thi
 Shoojit Sircar's film received a great response at the box office in its early days
 lekin IPL ke mahaasangram ke chalate ab is film kii kamai main badhat keval weekend par hi dekhne ko mil rahi he
 
 Avengers Infinity war varsej IPL 2018ab dekhnaa ye he ki kya IPL ke chalate avengers bhartiya darshakon main apana puraane vaala charm paane main safal ho paaegaa
 Because the box office earnings of the previous films of Avengers were quite impressive, even the old series of Avengers has already broken the records of Bollywood films at the box office
 bataa den saal 2015 main relies hui avengers-age of Ultron film ne bharat main 77 karod rupee kii kamai kii thi
 If a Bollywood film releases with the Avengers this time too, it is obvious that the business of these films is set to be divided
 kyonki avengers ke alaava or bhi kai hit hollywood filmon kaa craij bharat main dekhne ko mila he
 There are many great Hollywood movies which have earned a great deal on the Bollywood box
 jaise:blike panther(2018)- 38karod rupee bharat main(2017) main relies hui hollywood filmon kii bharat main kamai ke aankadeenabell: criation-44 karodaghuashdhiansh OF THE GALAXY VOL 2- 21

 78 crorewonder Women - 29 croretransformers: The Last Night - 30 crores are making a blast on the Internet
 IPL ke har match ke saath darshakon kaa romaanch badhata hi ja rahaa he
 So will the new Avengers movie get the love of the audience? Will IPL really impact the business of this film? The answers to these questions will be found in the opening and weekend collections of this film
 is tarah is baar hollywood kii takkar bollywood se nahin balki IPL se he
 The box office gave the report of who would be the winner compared to the IPL VS Avengers
 isi ke saath ab ye indiens ko tay karnaa he ki vah apane cricket hiroj ko pehle dekhnaa pasand karte hai yaa phir avengers ke hiroj ko
 Let us tell Avengers infinity war the film is going to release in India on 27th April and the final of IPL 2018 is on 27th May

 Moti Lal Nehru was born on 6 May 1861
 unke pita kaa naam gangadhar nehru tha, jinka moti laal nehru ke janm se teen maheene pehle hi nidhan ho gaya
 Moti Lal did 'bar at Law' from Cambridge University and also practiced as a lawyer in Kanpur

 Motilal Nehru has been named among the largest lawyers in the country
 saal 1900 main elahabaad ke civil lines main unhone ek vishaal haveli kharidi, jiskaa naam rakhaa anand bhawan

 1919 se 1920 or 1928 se 1929 ke dauraan moti laal nehru do baar congress ke adhyaksh rahe
 During the Special Congress of Calcutta in 1920, he was the first line leader who gave his support to the non-cooperation movement

 Will Narayan Sai tell the truth? Will Narayan Sai iqbal-e-jurm? Will Narayan Sai destroy the secret of his crime? At present, the Surat-e-hall of Narayan Sai in front of the Surat police does not seem so at all
 surat police kaa kahana he ki narayan sai behad shaatir he or wo lagaataar police ko gumraah karne kii koshish kar rahaa he
 So now the Surat Police has decided that whatever interrogation of Narayan Sai will be held on camera for the next six days in police custody
 agar surat police ne agle 6 dinon main sara sach narayan sai se ugalva liya to phir sai kaa hashr bhi apane baap aasaraam se juda nahin hoga
 It is possible that the result is worse than the father
 kyonki narayan sai ab surat police ke saamne jo bhi bolegaa, jo bhi ugalega wo sab camere main kaid hoga
 In fact, the Surat police has decided that during the next six days of police custody, they will do all the interrogation of Narayan Sai on camera
 taaki baad main adaalat main pahunchakar wo apane gunahon se palat naa sake
 Narayan Sai is also no less intelligent
 use pataa he ki camere par kaboolnamaa use umr bhar ke liye salaakhon ke peeche pahunchaa degaa
 That is why, according to the Surat Police, despite being in custody at present, it is not helping the police in interrogation
 balki lagaataar police ko uljhane kii koshish kar rahaa he
 According to Surat police sources, Narayan Sai is constantly telling the police that he is innocent and he is being implicated under the conspiracy
 lekin surat police kaa kahana he ki uske paas, narayan sai ke paapon kaa itnaa sara kaccha-chittha he ki wo zyada der tak police ko ghuma nahin paaegaa
 According to the Surat police, the two dates of the two sisters of Surat, the place mentioned, and the people who were said to be witnesses have found all the things right
 yani balaatkaar kaa unka iljaam galat nahin he
 The bus police are preparing to surround Sai by connecting all the links
 police ke mutabik narayan sai ke khilaaf itane saboot hai ki wo koshish karke bhi unhen jhuthla nahin saktaa
 Surat Police is now preparing to conduct a DNA test, narco and potency test with permission from the court to encircle Sai completely
 police kii ek team un dastavejon kii bhi jaanch kar rahi he jo use narayan sai ke ahmedabad ashram par red ke dauraan mili the
 According to sources, these documents contain information about illegal transactions of crores of rupees and now the police is trying to find out who gave so much money to Narayan Sai and where Narayan Sai used this money
 police surat kii un do bahanon ke alaava un ladakiyon ko bhi talash rahi he jinase uski santaanen hui hai
 The Surat Police has prepared a long list of questions for questioning Narayan Sai
 par narayan sai he ki munh kholane ko raji hi nahin ho rahaa
 According to the police, he is not helping at all in the interrogation
 police usase jo bhi sawaal puuchhati he to wo use ghumaane vaale jawaab detaa he
 So to get the truth out of Narayan Sai, the police is preparing to bring some such people in front of him, after which the verdict of truth and lies will be decided automatically
 puure 58 dinon tak narayan sai desh ke chah alag-alag rajyon main ghumta rahaa, chhupataa rahaa
 Apparently during this time countless people would have helped him, he would have been sheltered
 is chakkar main ab un tamaam logon kii bhi shamat aane vaali he
 The police is extracting the address of all those places along with his account of 58 days from Narayan Sai

 The book 'shiksha', written by Delhi's Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia about the innovative experiments done about the state's education system, does not only put a question mark on the existing system, but also offers solutions
 kisi ko yah tanj lagegaa to kisi ko vinamrata, lekin sisodiya desh main shiksha par ab tak hue or rajdhani main pichley saadhe chaar saal ke dauraan hue kaam ke fark ko kuch is tarah samajhaate hai, ‘‘iiem, dilli vishvavidhyalay, banaras hindu uniwarsity, iity jaise kai or bade santhaan hamane nahin khulwaaye, shiksha ko moulik banane main bhi hamaari sarkaar kaa koi yogadan nahin he

 hamaara shiksha kaa model sirf us parampara ko tod rahaa he jisamen 5 pratishat bacchon ko aalaa darje kii shiksha vyavastha milti he to 95 pratishat shiksha kii buniyadi jaruraton ke liye bhi tarasate hai
 Describing in detail the steps taken to double the budget allocation to reform the education system, this book also offers examples of bureaucracy and red tape
 jaise skulon ke buniyadi dhaanche kii ekamusth jaankaree kaa shiksha vibhaag nideshaalay ke paas na hona, skulon ke liye jameen kii maang par dilli vikaas praadhikaran (didie) ke adngebaaj ravaie kaa zikr karte hue dilli ke up mukhyamantri jameen ke maamalon ke liye jimmedaar centre sarkaar ke asahyogaatmak ravaie par nishaanaa sadhana nahin bhoolatey
 This book narrates the strategy of making school principals a responsible education leader and instilling old values in teachers
 bacchon ke bhavishya se khilwaad kar rahi shiksha vyavastha par nishaanaa sadhate hue yah kitaab shikshakon ke dukh-dard ko bhi saajha karti he
 Referring to the government work being done through the teachers, the author explains how the teachers have been made the means to take government schemes from door to door
 janaganana se lekar voter card tak ke survey main lage shikshak ke paas adhyayan-adhyaapan ke liye samay hi nahin bachataa
 The author has also given a lot of emphasis on the training system required for the development of teachers' capacity
 jahaan ek taraf yah pustak bacchon kii shiksha main mata-pita kii bhagidaari, khush rahane kii kala se lekar nae daur kii taiyaari ke liye udhyamiyon ko taiyaar karne ke liye shuru kiye gaye paathyakram ke bare main vistaar se bataati hai vahiin isamen rajya kii shiksha vyavastha ko lekar aage kii yojanaon kaa zikr bhi he
 However, in this book on the pretext of education, you also find political upbringing
 apni purvavarti sarkaron or maujuuda centre sarkaar par tanj karti panktiyaan lekhak ke us daawey ko thodaa halakaa karti he, jiske mutabik yah pustak kisi chunavi phaayde ke liye nahin balki shiksha ke ek behatar model ko pesh karne ke nazariye se likhi gai he
 But this does not mean that the book reduces its usefulness
 yah kitaab duusare rajyon ke liye shiksha ke kshetra main maardarshak kaa kaam kar sakati he
 Reading this, former President A
