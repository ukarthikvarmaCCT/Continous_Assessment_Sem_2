 He was in jail since May last year in connection with a disproportionate assets case

 During the hearing of the case, Jagan Mohan Reddy's counsel had said that the CBI has completed the investigation of Jagan's case, so he should now get bail

 The court directed Jaganmohan not to leave Hyderabad without the permission of the court and neither directly or indirectly influence any witness
 iske saath hi unhen maamle kii kaarywahi ke dauraan adaalat ke samaksh upasthit rahane ko bhi kaha gaya he
 The court said that if Jaganmohan violates these conditions, the CBI can seek cancellation of his bail
 yah maamla jaganmohan kii companiyon main vibhinn companiyon ke nivesh se sambandhit he jo unke pita wies rajasekhar reddy ke mukhyamantritv kaal ke dauraan anya laabh lene ke uddeshy se kiye gaye the
 Rajasekhara Reddy was the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh between 2004 and 2009
 vishleshkon ko lagata he ki jaganmohan kii rihaai se unki party ko nai urja mil sakati he, khaas kar tateey andhra or roilseema kshetron main jahaan pruthak telugana rajya banane ke prastaav ke virodh main pradarshan ho rahe hai
 Though the movement is getting wide support, till now there has been a lack of popular leader and Jaganmohan can overcome this deficiency
 jaganmohan kii patni bharti or wiesar congress ke kai netaa adaalat kaksh main maujuud the
 Earlier, the CBI had opposed Jaganmohan's bail plea, saying that mps from Kadapa could influence the hearing of the case after coming out on bail
 jaganmohan ne jamaanat yachika main daleel di thi ki andhra pradesh ko vibhajit kiye jane ko lekar tateey andhra or roilseema main chal rahe andolan ke maddenjar unke liye jaruri he ki ve logon ke saath rahen or ek raajnneetik dal ke netaa ke rup main andolan kii aguwai karen
 The principal investigating agency has so far filed 10 charge sheets against Jaganmohan in the high property case
 aakhri do aaropapatr 17 sitambar ko daakhil kiye gaye the
 BCCI chief and India Cements vice-president and managing director n Srinivasan, Dalmia Cements vice-president Punit Dalmia, Arabindo Ferma vice-president Nityananda Reddy, Ramki Infra chairman a Dasaradharami Reddy and Nimmagadda Prasad are also accused
 jaanch agency ne vibhinn aaropapatron main purv mantriyon em venkat raaman raav, sabita indra reddy or di prasad raav tathaa vartmaan mantri je gita reddy ke naam bhi shaamil kiye hai

 Earlier, the Supreme Court had on 5 October 2012 and on 9 May this year dismissed Jagan Mohan's bail petitions
 is bich, jaganmohan kii rihaai ko unki viares congress party ke liye manobal badhaane vaala ghatnakram kaha ja rahaa he
 His release tomorrow will not only give new energy to the party but will also bring a new twist in the politics of Andhra Pradesh at a time when there are agitations on the issue of partition in the state
 vishleshkon kaa kahana he ki nishchit rup se jaganmohan vartmaan raajnneetik paridrishy main tateey andhra-roilseema kshetra main nirvivaad netaa ke rup main ubharenge kyonki viares congress pehle hi ekikrut rajya kaa paksh le chuki he
 There is a strong movement for a unified state but there is a lack of effective leader in Seemandhra region
 raajnneetik vishleshkon ke anusaar, jaganmohan yah kami dur kar sakate hai
 However, Jagan will first have to resolve some internal issues related to his party
 ekikrut andhrapradesh kaa paksh lekar wiesar congress telugana kshetra main bahut kamjor ho chuki he
 The party is not in a strong position in many districts of Seemandhra region due to infighting
 iske alaava jaganmohan kareeb 16 maah se jail main the or is dauraan unki party ek tarah se netritv viheen thi
 However his mother YS Vijaya and younger sister Sharmila tried to shoulder the responsibility of the party
 tippaniyan Jagan also has to keep in mind the conditions of the bail before coming to the public
 ek shart main un par hyderabad se baahar jane par roak lagaai gai he
 Apart from his family, Jaganmohan used to meet political leaders of various parties during his 485 days stay in jail and gave directions to the party leadership on every issue from jail itself

 adaalat ne jaganmohan ko nirdesh diya ki vah adaalat kii anumati ke bagaiyr hyderabad se baahar nahin jaaenge or na hi sidhe yaa paroksh rup se kisi gavaah ko prabhavit karenge
 Along with this, he has also been asked to appear before the court during the proceedings of the case
 adaalat ne kaha ki agar jaganmohan in sharton kaa ulanghan karte hai to sibiai unki jamaanat radd karne kii maang kar sakati he
 The case relates to various companies' investments in Jaganmohan's companies with the aim of taking other benefits during his father YS Rajasekhara Reddy's chief ministership
 rajasekhar reddy 2004 se 2009 ke bich andhra pradesh ke mukhyamantri the
 Analysts feel that Jaganmohan's release could give his party new energy, especially in coastal Andhra and Rayalaseema regions where protests are being held against the proposal to create a separate Telangana state
 haalanki andolan ko vyapak samarthan mil rahaa he lekin ab tak yahaan lokapriy netaa kaa abhaav rahaa he or jaganmohan yah kami dur kar sakate hai
 Jaganmohan's wife Bharti and several YSR Congress leaders were present in the courtroom
 iske pehle sibiai ne jaganmohan kii jamaanat yachika kaa virodh karte hue kaha tha ki jamaanat par baahar aane ke baad kadappa se saansad maamle kii sunwaayee ko prabhavit kar sakate hai
 Jaganmohan had argued in the bail plea that in the wake of the agitation in coastal Andhra and Rayalaseema to divide Andhra Pradesh, it is necessary for him to be with the people and lead the movement as the leader of a political party
 
 pramukh jaanch agency ne jaganmohan ke khilaaf adhik sampatti maamle main ab tak 10 aarope patr daakhil kiye hai
 The last two chargesheets were filed on 17 September
 is maamle main bisisiai pramukh or india cements ke upaadhyaksh tathaa prabandh nideshak en shrinivasana, daalamia cements ke upaadhyaksh punit daalamia, arbindo ferma ke upaadhyaksh nityanand reddy, ramki inphra ke adhyaksh e dasradharami reddy or nimmgadda prasad sahit kai rasukhdaar log bhi aaropee hai
 The investigating agency has also included the names of former ministers m Venkat Raman Rao, Sabita Indra Reddy and d Prasad Rao and current minister j Geeta Reddy in various chargesheets
 udyogpati nimmgadda giraftaar ke baad se chanchalguda jail main hai
 Venkat Raman Rao has been granted interim bail due to health reasons
 jaganmohan ne jamaanat ke liye 11 sitambar ko yachika daakhil kii thi or daleel di thi ki ucchtam nyaayalay ne sibiai ko jaanch puraa karne ke liye chaar maheenon kaa samay diya tha or yah 9 sitambar ko puraa ho gaya he
 Jaganmohan is lodged in the Chanchalguda Central Jail here since 27 May 2012 after his arrest
 iske pehle ucchtam nyaayalay ne 5 aktubar 2012 or is saal 9 may ko jaganmohan kii jamaanat yachikaaon ko khaarij kar diya tha
 Meanwhile, Jaganmohan's release is being called a morale-boosting event for his YRS Congress party
 kal unki rihaai na keval party ke liye nai urja dene vaali hogi balki aise samay par andhrapradesh kii raajnneeti main nayaa mode laaegi jab rajya main vibhaajan ke mudde par andolan chal rahe hai
 Analysts say that Jaganmohan will surely emerge as the undisputed leader in the coastal andhra-rayalaseema region in the current political scenario as the YRS Congress has already favored a unified state
 ekikrut rajya ke liye majboot andolan chal rahaa he lekin simandhra kshetra main prabhavi netaa kaa abhaav he
 According to political analysts, Jaganmohan can overcome this shortfall
 baharhaal jagan ko sabase pehle apni party se jude kuch andruni mudde sulajhane honge
 The YSR Congress has become very weak in the Telangana region by favoring a united Andhra Pradesh
 andruni kalah kii vajah se simandhra kshetra ke kai jilon main bhi party majboot sthiti main nahin he
 Apart from this, Jaganmohan was in jail for nearly 16 months and during this time his party was devoid of leadership
 haalanki unki maa wies vijaya or choti bahan sharmila ne party kii jimmedaari nibhaane kii koshish kii

 Has the Modi government enacted a law under which tribals can be shot? This sounds shocking to hear, but in a video that is becoming increasingly viral on social media, Congress President Rahul Gandhi is saying exactly this
 tamaam log unke is bayaan par naaraazgi jataate hue tikhi pratikriya de rahe hai
 Amit Malviya, the head of the BJP IT department, even called Rahul Gandhi a habitual liar for this statement
 Rahul Gandhi is a congenital LIAR! Can you imagine anyone else speaking such lies and getting away with it? No fact check on Rahul Gandhi’s speeches, no outrage either
 
 
 This subservience to the family is frankly worrying
 But trust the people of India to reject such bigotry

 However, Rahul Gandhi's talk cannot be called a lie, because the government has taken steps to make a big change in the Indian Forest Act 1927 law that they are talking about and to shoot forest officials under the new provisions
 It has also been said to be given the right to
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi kaa jo video clip viral ho rahaa he, wo unke 23 april ko madhya pradesh ke shadol main die gaye ek bhaashan se liya gaya he

 'rahul gandhi jis indian forest act 1927 kii baat kar rahe hai, usamen sanshodhan kaa ek masauda sarkaar ne is saal ke shuru main taiyaar kiya tha

 In this, the forest officers have been given all the rights that they never had before and which will make them legally powerful

 Not only this, it has also been said that there are many crimes in which the accused will have the responsibility to prove himself innocent and until he proves that, he will be considered guilty
 isi masaudemen pej number 84 par (panit number 66) adhikariyon ko goli chalaane kaa adhikaar dene kii baat likhi hai
 It says that a new provision is being included in the law, according to which if the Forest Act 1927 or Wildlife Conservation Act 1927 is needed to prevent a crime or to catch a criminal, then the forest officer Can use a gun
 is baat kaa dhyaan rakhte hue ki nuksaan kam se kam ho
 It is also written in the draft that for such action taken to prevent crime, the officer will not be prosecuted without the approval of the state government
 haalanki kanoon main sanshodhan karne ke liye ye tamaam baaten abhi sirf masaude main kahi gai hai, jinke bare main rajya sarkaron ko charchaa karke apane vichaar bhejne ko kaha gaya he
 These proposals can be included in the law only if these provisions are passed by both houses of parliament

 beete kuch saalon main skini genes pahanane kaa chalan kaaphi badha he
 In such a situation, girls are resorting to vaginal surgery to look beautiful
 ek plastic sarjan kii maane to beete kuch samay main diziner vajaina ke liye surgery karaane vaali ladakiyon kii sankhya main kaaphi ijapha hua he
 Vaginal surgeries range from 16-year-old girls to 70-year-old women
 aamtaur par in ladakiyon or mahilaon kii maang hoti he ki cosmetic surgery karke unke guptang kaa aakaar or rup badal diya jaae
 The surgery is done on the upper part of the genitals or on the outermost part of you can say
 lekin sawaal ye uthta he ki aakhir vajaina surgery kii jarurat hi kyon he?britain ke gayanacologist doctor ahamed ismail ke anusaar har vajaina kaa apana aakaar hota he or ye har mahila main uske anuroop hota he
 If you do not have any kind of pain or discomfort in the genitals then this is absolutely right and you do not need any kind of surgery
 mahilaon main achaanak se aae is badlaav ke liye media main aane vaali khabaren or celebraties hai
 Because of these women are now finding such surgery necessary
 unhen ye lagane laga he ki surgery karakar hi wo khubasurat ban sakengi
 The biggest problem is that they compare their private parts with other women
 ismail bataate hai ki unke paas kai aisi mahilaayein aati hai jo unase ye puuchhati hai ki kya unka guptang saamaanya he
 Ismail says that to women who ask such questions, i say that there is no such thing as perfect looking vajina
 har aurat ke sharir kii banaavat alag hoti he
 No organ can be of one size, one form, one color and there can be no such thing as ideal organ in terms of organs
 ye baat sharir ke sabhi angon ke liye lagu hoti he or vajaina isse alag nahin he
 Ismail says that if you have no pain or discomfort in your vagina, then your vagina is very normal
 aise main kisi se bhi tulana karnaa galat he
 All you have to do is keep your private parts clean and healthy
 ismail ke anusaar, sharir ke sabhi angon kii tarah vajaina bhi umr ke saath badalata he
 Its shape and color can change with age, so there is no need to fear or worry
 diziner vajaina surgery kii badhati maang ko dekhte hue ismail kehete hai ki labiaplasty karana ahm nahin he
 Most important is to keep your organs clean and healthy

 uttarakhand mul ke cricket khilaadi desh bhar main dhooma machaa rahe hai, lekin iske baavjood yahaan aaj tak cricket kaa buniyadi dhaancha tak khadaa nahin ho paaya he
 Indian cricket team captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, ipl's first century Piyush Pandey, Delhi's IPL player Unmukt Chand as well as players of Uttarakhand origin are playing in teams of many states including Delhi, Rajasthan, West Bengal, Punjab, but see the irony That the cricket academies of Uttarakhand are yet to get BCCI recognition
 rajya main cricket kii ek manyata praapt association tak nahin he
 Therefore, the team from Uttarakhand is deprived of participating in a cricket series like Ranji Trophy
 kaaphi samay se bisisiai ke adhikari uttarakhand kaa daura kar aashwast kar rahe hai, lekin yah bhi hawaii vaayadon se zyada kuch nahin he
 Mahendra Singh Dhoni is originally from Lwali village in Almora district, while Piyush Pandey belongs to Bageshwar and Unmukt Chand from Pithoragarh

 sabko apni dukaan chalaani he or sab bisisiai kii rajya association se sambhddhata kii raah main roda bane hue hai
 As a result, the recognition of the cricket association here has become a political gift

 Their struggle is on and the youth of the state is obsessed with cricket
 maidaanon kii to baat hi jane dijie, yahaan pahaado par bhi aapako agar koi khel dikhaai degaa to vah cricket hi he
 People's passion for cricket can be gauged from the fact that at times the number of teams participating in local cricket competitions held in remote areas crosses the 100 mark
 is samay rajya ke 20 se adhik khilaadi duusare rajyon kii tiimon se junior va senior cricket team main khel rahe hai
 Not only boys, girls of Uttarakhand are also earning a name in cricket
 almoda kii ekta bisht rashtriya mahila cricket team kii sadsy hai or is samay australia ke saath vishakhapatnam main shrinkhalaa khel rahi hai
 Four girls from Uttarakhand are playing in the women's cricket team of Punjab alone

 Then this association was first formed in Dehradun and later in Nainital
 dehradun kii district lig ko is saal 61 saal puure ho gaye hai, jabaki nainital kii cricket lig bhi lagaataar yojit hoti rahi he

 On the question of recognition, both these associations were called in meetings in Mumbai in 2009 and also in Delhi in 2010
 lekin usie kaa maananaa he ki uskaa daawa zyada majboot he
 Arya says, 'UCA is the only association that has its own body across the state
 ham bisisiai kii guideline ke mutabik hi kaam karte hai
 At the behest of BCCI, UCA has discontinued senior label cricket and has now started focusing on Under 14, 16, 19 and 22

 in gyaarah saalon main gavaah, saboot, sunwaayee ne kai baar rukh palata
 Sometimes Salman was seen getting relief, sometimes he appeared miserable and growing
 is dauraan salmaan or mumbai police par ye iljaam bhi lage ki wo cese or gavaah donon ko kamjor karne kii koshish kar rahe hai
 And in the midst of all this, on Wednesday, before the verdict in the presence of Salman, the Mumbai Sessions Court ruled that Salman had woken up again that night
 aaj 'dambag' salmaan khan apane kariyar ke sabase sunahare daur se guzar rahe hai
 Salman Khan, who touches the soil and made gold, has made a series of films which have earned more than hundred crores
 magar mukaddar ke is sikandar kii takadir kabhi ek jaisi nahin rahi
 Both fame and trouble clung to Salman like a twin
 or aisi hi ek musiibat he jo pichley 11 saalon se salmaan kaa peechha kar rahaa he
 Which compels them to appear in real courts outside film sets like this again and again
 aakhir koun he wo bhoot jo pichley 11 saalon se unka peechha chhodane ko taiyaar nahin he?13 saal pehle, 22 sitambar 2002, juhu kaa ek paanch sitara hotelsalmaan kaa kad tab bhi us 70 mem kii screen se kahin zyada bada tha jiske bade parde ke wo bade sitare the
 But apart from being a big star, he had also achieved the title of Big Bad of Bollywood
 'ham dil de chuke sanam' kii superhit kamyaabi or mohabbat or nafrat ke bich aishwarya raay ke naam tadap-tadap ke is dil se aah nikalati rahi alaap ke darmyaan 22 sitambar kii raat salmaan juhu ke ek five star hotel main party kii jaan bane hue the
 The party was his late night
 raat teen baje ke baad salmaan party se baahar nikalate hai
 Completely drunk
 ghar jane ke liye unke paas us raat safed rang kii toyta land kruger gaadi thi
 Along with driving the bodyguard less driver
 magar nashe main chur hone ke baad bhi salmaan khud driving seat par ja baithe
 The bodyguard kept refusing
 par shaayad tab bhi salmaan ek baar jo kamitment kar lete the to phir khud kii bhi nahin sunate the
 Chur Salman's car at American Express Bakery, Hill Road, Bandranashe at 3
30 am, arrives at Bandra's Hill Road at exactly 3:40 am in the dark of night
 gaadi kii raftaar behad tej thi or driver nashe main
 Shortly before the American Express Bakery on Hill Road, the driver suddenly loses the balance of the vehicle and in a moment the car leaves the road from the left side and starts running on the pavement
 badanasibi se us vakt usee footpath par american express bekri main kaam karne vaale paanch karmchaaree so rahe the
 The high speed land cruiser overtakes the five and then stops the car after hitting the shutter of the shop
 haadase main ek mazdoor kareeb-kareeb maukey par hi dam tod detaa he
 While four laborers are badly injured
 chaaron main se zyaadaatar ke pair ko gaadi ne rond daalaa tha
 Salman Khan suddenly gets nervous after the accident
 wo drivingan seat se neeche utarate hai
 By then, the rest of the people sleeping around after hitting the pavement of the car and hearing the shouts of the injured, also wake up and reach the spot
 log gaadi ke neeche fanse logon ko baahar niklaate hai or unhen aspataal le jaaya jaataa he
 Salman had left the vehicle on the spot and had disappeared by then
 par 70 mem kii screen se bhi jiskaa kad bada ho, uski ek jhalak use pahchaanane ke liye kaaphi hoti he
 Everyone had known Salman before running away
 subah hote-hote puri mumbai main khabar fail chuki thi
 Salman Khan had another stain on his son
 par haadase ke baad se khud salmaan gaayab the
 But the vehicle number and the eyewitnesses had devoured Chugli against Salman
 lihaaza subah-subah police salmaan ke ghar pahunchati he
 But Salman was not at home
 darasal salmaan khan kanoonee khel ke liye kuch vakt chaahate the
 That is why he was missing
 par unhen pataa tha ki zyada der bhaagane se mushkilen bad sakati hai
 There will be difficulty in getting bail
 lihaaja haadase ke kareeb aath ghante baad wo khud saamne aate hai or police unhen giraftaar kar leti he
 He is then taken to JJ Hospital
 jahaan jaanch ke baad ye sabit ho jaataa he ki unhone alcohol liya tha
 The police register a case of negligence and dangerous driving against Salman
 lekin giraftaar ke kuch der baad hi unhen mahaj 950 rupye ke jurmaane ke saath jamaanat par reeha kar detii he
 Some social organizations protest against Salman's release so easily and reach court on 5 October 2002
 wo adaalat main salmaan ke khilaaf ek janhit yachika daakhil kar salmaan par gaiyr iradatan hatya kaa mukatadama darj karne kii maang karte hai
 The court not only accepts the plea but also on October 7, 2002, on a court order, Salman is arrested for culpable homicide not amounting to murder
 salmaan jail chale jate hai
 They remain in jail for the entire 18 days
 is dauraan wo chaar baar jamaanat kii arji dete hai
 But the bail application is rejected four times
 phir aakhirkaar 18 din baad 24 aktubar 2002 ko salmaan ko jamaanat mil jaati he or wo reeha ho jate hai
 After Salman's release, the case continues in court
 is dauraan cese main kai mode aate hai
 First of all it is said from Salman that he was not only driving that night, but someone else was driving
 phir haadase ke chaar saal baad ek roj achaanak cese kaa ek ahm gavaah abdulla rauf shaikh bhi apni gavaahi se palat jaataa he
 Abdullah was the eye witness of the case and was injured in the accident
 shuru main usne police ko kaha tha ki usne haadase ke baad salmaan ko gaadi kii driving seat se neeche utarataa dekha tha
 But four years later in 2006, he tells the court that he did not see Salman on the spot
 lekin is gavaahi se salmaan ko raahat milti usase pehle hi khud salmaan ke purv bodyguard rabindra patil ne salmaan ko jhatka de diya
 Ravindra Patil was present with Salman in the same car the night of the accident
 usne adaalat ko bataaya ki us raat salmaan nashe main chur the or uske manaa karne ke baad bhi vahi gaadi chalaa rahe the
 While some other victims of the accident were also on the testimony
 alag-alag gavaahon or bayanon main ulajhate-ulajhate cese ko 11 saal biit gaye
 And now finally the court has decided to prosecute Salman under culpable homicide not driving recklessly
 salmaan par ipisi kii dhara 304(2) ke tahat gaiyr-iradatan hatya kaa maamla darj kiya gaya
 At the same time, under section 279, the charge of drunk driving and reckless driving was fixed
 jabaki dhara 337 or 338 ke tahat gambhir chot pahunchane kaa aarope laga
 Apart from this, charges were also made under section 427
 yani aage kaa dagar ab mushkil ho gaya he
 Salman can go to jail for up to ten years if proven guilty
 haalanki salmaan khan ko itani raahat jarur mili ki ab unhen har sunwaayee par court kaa chakkar nahin lagaana padegaa
 But the court has also made it clear that whenever needed, Salman will have to come to the court without any hesitation
 adaalat ne maamle main sunwaayee kii agali taarikh 19 agast mukarrar kii he

 This session was conducted by Shweta Singh
 shweta ne manish sisodiya se poocha ki aakhir kyon jiesti council main sarkaar ke saath sur main sur milaane ke baad aam aadmi party sarkaar kaa virodh kar rahi he
 Manish Sisodia said that this idea of the Central Government is very good, but the way to implement it is not right
 sisodiya ne kaha ki unhone council main jiro fisadi tex kii baat rakhi thi
 At the same time, the government has imposed many types of taxes, which are being questioned
 sisodiya ke mutabik chaay ke biscuit par 28 % tex koun de paaegaa
 He said that this is the first time that clothes will also be taxed
 yejiastisirf sarkaar kii aamadani badhaane vaala tex he
 Manish said that with the implementation of GST, inflation will increase significantly
 unhone kaha ki centre sarkaar ne hamaare kai idia maane, unhone is kai tarah se isamen acchhee bahes kii
 But failed to take a big decision, a lot can be done with GST
 manish sisodiya ne kaha ki 28% tex desh ke aam aadmi ke liye kaaphi zyada he
 He said that the wrong decision to keep alcohol and real state out of it, both of them should have been brought under the purview of GST
 aap cement jaisi chizon par jiesti laga rahe hai par real state nahin lagaana galat he
 Sisodia said that in the Hamnetax system, Delhi has changed very well, it would have been very good if the central government had taken the people into confidence
 manish sisodiya bole ki abhi bhi mere paas isko lekar sawaal zyada hai, or unke jawaab kam hai
 He said that the central and state government will benefit more from its implementation, not the common man
 unhone kaha ki jiesti laana koi aparaadh nahin he, lekin isse janata ko phayda hona jaruri he lekin aisa nahin dikh rahaa he
 Still people are afraid about it
 sisodiya ne kaha ki iskaa jashn manaanaa sahi nahin he, ye bina jashn ke lagu hona chahie tha
 He said that anyone who has an understanding of tax will understand that now he has moved from VAT to the grip of GST
 unhone kaha ki aisa system hona chahie ki log khushi-khushi tex den, aisa maahaul nahin bananaa chahie ki log chori karnaa shuru karaden
 If our government reduced the tax, the revenue of tax has increased
 ye koi aazaadee nahin he, kya ham pehle aarthik aazaadee main the
 If it is freedom, then we do not know the meaning of freedom
 manish sisodiya ne kaha ki abhi koi bhi nahin kah saktaa ki vah jiesti kaa export he
 GST will benefit when people start paying tax happily
 agar vyapaariyon ko lagata he ki kuch galat ho rahaa he, to virodh karnaa unka haq he

 ab to aise projects ke jariye dedh lakh se zyada rojgaar or naukariyaan aaengi
 That is, the umbrella of development is opening
 chhattisgarh ke mukhyamantriramansingh ne disambar 2017 ke maheene kaa zyaadaatar vakt puure soobe kaa chakkar katate hue bitaayaa
 Riding on the craft plane between the state government, he measured the distance of miles and participated in the programs of distributing Tendupatta bonus in tribal areas
 tendupatta toduya chhattisgarh ke takreeban 13 lakh adivasee pariwaron kii ahm aarthik gatividhi he
 The bonus distribution programs were the brainchild of the late Arjun Singh, who was then the Chief Minister of United Madhya Pradesh
 1980 ke dashak main tab ise unke siyaasi masterstroke ke taur par dekha gaya tha
 bjp's Chief Minister Raman Singh, who has been in the chair for the longest time in the country, hopes that these bonuses, distributed as bonus, amount to about Rs 273 crore
 or adivaasiyon ke liye unki kai or yojanaayen 2018 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main gemeanger sabit hongi
 The government paid a standard sack of Tendu Leaves to pay Rs 1,800
 se badhaakar 2,500 ru
 Tax and this increased amount is being distributed as a bonus
 raman singh apni sabhaaon main vikaas or kalyaan kii baaten karte hai, vahiin unhen yah bhi acchhee tarah pataa he ki bhaajapa ne pichley chunaavon main in adivasee siton par bahut acha pradarshan nahin kiya tha or agar unhen madhya bharat main bhaajapa ke is garh ko bachaana he to in behad ahm adivasee matadaataaon kaa dil jeetna hi hoga
 So what is Raman Singh's gameplan for these elections? He says, "development is the central theme of my campaign
 rajya main 2004 or 2017 ke bich ke ahm aankadon kii tulana kiijie or aapako jabardast badlaav dekhne ko milegaa
 "he has a point
" ho bhi kyon naa! aakhir aankade unhen khush karne vaale jo hai
 In these 14 years, since they have been in power, government schools have increased from 20,000 to 60,000, medical colleges have increased from two to 10, government universities have increased from three to 13, colleges have increased from 116 to 214 and engineering colleges have increased from 12 to 50
 sehat ke morche par shishu mrity dar (iemr) har 1,000 adivaasiyon par 70 se ghatakar 41 par aa gai, vahiin jaccha mrityu anupaat (mmr) har 1,00,000 prasav par 379 se ghatakar 221 par aa gaya
 Malnutrition is still high, but it has come down from 52 per cent to 30 per cent, while the total number of medical facilities has increased from 4,500 to 6,000
 buniyadi dhaanche ke maamle main pradhanmantri gram sadak yojana main sadakon kii lambaai 2004 ke 1,072 kimi se badhkar 2017 main 22,750 kimi ho gai, sabhi mausamon main kargar sadaken isi vakt main 7,000 kimi ke ijaphe ke saath 36,000 kimi ho gayi
 Electricity generation increased from 4,732 MW to 22,764 MW and average consumption increased from 525 units to 1,724 units
 is bich 97 fisadi gaanvon main bijli pahunch gai
 On the farm front, where loans are provided at zero interest, the horticulture crops have increased six times now with the state's 7
 25 lakh hectare main ugaai jaati hai
 Despite these spectacular figures, Raman Singh, the warrior of many electoral battles, realizes that he will have to do more than that to achieve a fourth term in power
 vah bhi tab jab vipakshi dal congress buree haalat main he
 Former Chief Minister Ajit Jogi has split from the Congress to form his Janata Congress Chhattisgarh (JCC) party and in such a situation the Congress does not even have a 'face', which is very important in the elections being fought on the strength of the personalities
 2003 main pehle chunaav se hi (chhattisgarh 2000 main alag rajya bana) vidhansabha chunaavon main jabardast kaante kaa mukaable hota rahaa he or har baar behad maamuli voton ke antar se tay hota he ki koun sarkaar banayega (2013 main 0
 75 percent)
 2013 main bhaajapa ne adivaasiyon ke liye arakshit 29 main se mahaj 11 siten jiti thim
 a senior BJP leader says, "bonuses have been distributed keeping tribal votes in mind and electricity and paved roads have been provided to villages and villages
" party ko agar november 2018 main hone vaala chunaav jeetna he to aisa karnaa jaruri he
 "but all this exercise is not a guarantee that the party will perform well in the elections
" congress kii devati karma sareekhe vidhayakon ne ji-jaan laga di he or joardaar takkar dene ke liye qamar kas lee hai
 Devati is the widow of party leader Mahendra Karma who was killed in the massacre in 2013 in the Zeeram Valley
 purv mantri or vidhayak satyanarayan sharma kehete hai, ''congress ko chhattisgarh main ab bhi adivaasiyon kaa bharosa hasil he
 BJP will not be able to mislead them
 '' vidambnaa he ki jis soobe main 32 fisadi adivasee aabaadi he, vahaan congress or bhaajapa, donon main hi bahut gine-chune adivasee netaa hai
 An important electoral issue for the BJP would be the distribution of paddy bonus, which was discontinued in 2014 after the Modi government came to power at the Center
 raman singh ne ise centre se dobaaraa chaalu karavaaya
 1,550 to 6 lakh farmers in the state
 prati quintal dhan kii kharid par 300 ru
 16 lakh farmers are expected to get the benefit of additional payment of Rs
 maowad ko bhi kaabo main kiya gaya he
 Things are better today than they were five years ago
 singh ko iskaa bhi kuch shrey milegaa
 As far as the private front is concerned, Raman Singh's popularity is still intact
 varshon kii mehnat se unhone mridubhashi or achche shaks kii chhavi banaai he, jo ab bhi unke kaam aa rahi he
 The most important factor in the 2018 elections will be Jogi and his JCC
 bhaajapa ko lagata he ki jogi congress ke paramparaagat vot kaatenge, par yah utana saaf bhi nahin he
 Jogi has announced 11 candidates and is paying more attention to the seats in central Chhattisgarh where his staunch supporter Satnami community resides
 2013 ke chunaavon main bhaajapa ne rajya kii anusuchit jatiyon (essi) ke liye arakshit 10 main se 9 siten jiti thim
 These were the same seats where Satnami votes could impact the results
 lihaaja agar satnami vot jogi ke paale main chale jate hai, to ve bhaajapa ko jarur nuksaan pahunchaa sakate hai, kyonki pichhali baar is samudaay ke vot thok ke bhav bhaajapa ko mili the
 Not only this, 7 in the state
 10 fisadi ke kareeb savarna jatiyon yani brahman, thakur or vaisya ke vot hai, jinka ek hissaa congress ke paale main laut saktaa he, jo use us vakt chhodkar chalaa gaya tha jab jogi ne bataur mukhyamantri sari takat adivasee or anusuchit jatiyon ke peeche laga di thi
 In 2013, the BJP had a huge lead in the urban seats of Raipur, Durg and Raigad
 is baar party in siton ko banaae rakhane ke liye pradhanmantri narendra modi ke karishme par nirbhar rahegi
 Says Jogi, "the BJP will convert it into a personality-based contest
 satta virdohi bhaavana ko palatney ke liye ve netaa ke taur par piem modi ko bich main laaenge
 i will answer this with the issue of 'chhattisgarhi Mahtari' and its pride
 ''noujvaan bhi raman singh ke radar par hai
 1 of 2013 7 karod votaron main is baar 32 lakh nae voter judye kii ummid he
 To woo them, the Chief Minister is distributing smartphones and revolutions of skill development centers
 asal main, in nae votaron par tamaam partiyon or netaaon kii nigahen lagi hai
 Jogi is giving a slogan of Chhattisgarh pride for bringing them into his court and accusing the BJP government of giving jobs to outsiders and taking away the rights of local youth
 soobe main basapa kii ahmiyat bani hui he
 In the last elections, it had consistently received about 5 percent votes
 aise main basapa ke saath aupchaarik yaa anaupchaarik talmail kaa phayda behad kade mukaable main gathbandhan ke duusare bhagidaar ko bhi mil saktaa he
 Apart from the anti-incumbency sentiment, Raman Singh is also grappling with the common perception of leading a corrupt government
 congress ne augusta westland helicopter kii kharid or naagarik aapurti nigam ke ghotaale sahit kai mudde uthaae hai, par uskaa kahana he ki un sabhi ko dabaa diya gaya
 Raman Singh answers this by saying that the Congress "could not prove anything"
 
 
 unke paas koi saboot hi nahin he
 "CM may deny the charges, but the perception in the street is that no work is done without bribe
" raipur ke ek afasar kehete hai, ''yah sattadhari party ko nuksaan pahunchayegaa
 The case of amendment brought to weaken Section 165 (6) of the Land Revenue Code may also return to haunt the BJP
 agar yah paarit ho jaataa to adivaasiyon kii jameen kii saarvajanik uddeshyon ke liye bikri kaa rasta saaf ho jaataa
 But it was equally opposed by both opposition and tribal organizations and was eventually withdrawn
 soobe main afasarshahi kaa bolbalaa he
 Due to this, the political masters remain extremely angry
 bhaajapa ke ek bade kartadharta kehete hai, ''hamane mantriyon se apane prabhaar vaale jilon main har maheene do raaten bitaane ke liye kaha he
 This will hurt the hurt feelings of party workers feeling neglected
 ''varisht patrkaar girija shankar kehete hai, ''chhattisgarh main na to koi jignesh mewaani yaa hardik patel he or na hi sarkaar ke khilaaf koi andolan he, jiskaa phayda congress uthaa sake
 This goes in favor of Raman Singh, yet the Congress has deep roots in the state
 khel main waapas lautne main use bahut zyada vakt nahin lagegaa
 "chhattisgarh remains a nightmare for Chhattisgarh election pundits because of the direct margin between the two sides, the very small margin of victory and defeat in the last elections and the presence of one Jogi in the form of Jogi
 *** The Ethics Committee of the Rajya Sabha is considering canceling the Rajya Sabha membership of Vijay Mallya, a businessman who left the country after taking a loan from banks, but SP MP Naresh Aggarwal has stood up against the Ethics Committee in the matter

 The first story is that of its main character Suryakant who is expelled from his family on behalf of his father because he loves Gauri and wants to marry her
 sultanpur main vah prachand kohre se ghiri jaade kii thithurati raat thi jab sooryakanth gauri ko apane parivaar se milwane laayaa tha
 The fog was so dense that his own clothes were barely visible
 raat ke 11 baje sooryakanth kii gardan pakad kar use or gauri ko baahar dhakel diya tha babuji ne or jor se darwaja band kar liya tha
 Babuji was shouting profanity at Gauri at the door
 duusari kahani he arbapati ranjor pandey or unke dada bhagelu kumhaar urf bhagelu pandey kii jo india main akaal, sookhaa, garibi, bhukhmaree ke kaaran laachaari main girmitiyaa majdoor banakar kareeb 125 saal pehle surinam chale jate hai or jindagi bhar waapas apane parivaar ke paas aane ke liye tarasate rahete hai
 Now his billionaire grandson has come to India in search of his ancestors and due to which this whole story has been written
 teesri kahani sooryakanth ke chachaa kii he jo padhai main bahut hoshiyaar the
 Did a good job as well
 aishoaaraam kii sabhi chijen thim unke ghar main
 Life was cutting into great fun
 lekin patni main apni balavant cor (premika) kii talash karte chachaa ko ek jor kaa jhatka lagata he or vah apane shandaar makaan or parivaar se alag ek cameraa banaakar saadagi bharaa jivan jeene lagate hai
 The one person who has the most influence in Suryakant's life is his uncle, whose name is not disclosed anywhere in this novel
 donon ke bich umr kaa fark keval 4-5 saalon kaa he yani bachapan ek duusare ke sabase kareeb beetaa
 They grow up while studying together
 bhattije par chachaa kaa puraa chhap hota he lekin bade hone ke saath hi vichaaron main bada fark aata he
 Chacha lives in Sultanpur and is a professor but has quit his job because his family loves his earnings rather than his
 chachaa bhatija ke bich kai vishyon par tark chalata he
 The nephew's affirmative reply is readable on Chacha's anti-modernist arguments
 rochak anshchacha bhattije donon ko padhane kii aisi bhukh thi ki padhai ke dinon main ve skool ke liye jaldi nikal jate or skool ke get ke baahar kamred komal kii dukaan par baithkar akhbaar padhate the
 Not only this, uncle used to come here and read newspapers during the interval because all the Hindi newspapers used to come to the shop of comrade Komal
 kamred komal kii dukaan par communist or samaajwaadiyon kaa jamaavada lagata tha or chachaa ke jivan ke kalantar main yah prabhaav saaf dikhataa he
 The uncle's reading was that he had finished reading the course books in the first quarter itself
 skool ke librari se kitabon kii maang karne vaale wo 8 saalon main pehle chaatr the
 When the books kept in the shelves did not open with the keys, the librarian smashed his glass with a hammer and gave him a novel
 chachaa ne librarian se poocha ki ab isaki hifaazat kaise hogi? librarian ne tahaakaa lagaakar jawaab diya- koi churayega bhi inhen? bhala us librarian ko kahaan pataa tha ki padhai kii lat main chachaa hi vahaan kii kai kitaaben churaakar apane ghar kii shobhaa badha lenge
 Nephew Suryakant has an ability to read very fast due to his habit of reading
 jab gauri kai raat jagakar likhaa prem patr sooryakanth ko detii he to vah ise kuch hi der main pard letaa he or isse gauri gussa ho jaati he kyonki vah samajhati he sooryakanth ne uske prem patr kaa majaak udaaya he
 Naubat even comes to the point that she stops talking to Suryakant
 kahani main immergency ke dauraan nasbandi ke khauf kaa zikr bhi he
 There was such a degree of sterilization on the students of school and college that at all times they had one hand staying on their genitals
 sooryakanth kii lakhanu se sultanpur or vahaan se gosinganj kii yatra main jagdamba, noopur, kaamana, shibboo samet or bhi kai paatr is kahani main aate hai jo is kahani ko mjedaar banaate hai
 When you read this story, you will know: Why does Suryakant, who is in high position in the Directorate of Tourism, have to go on long leave from job? Why did the fear of sterilization during Emergency and many of the children who went to Mundan during this time get half-shaved? Why does the head of the family full of Aishoram, who are uncles here, leave their family and live separately? Can Suryakant succeed the billionaire Ramajor Pandey? Among the questions are many things in this story
 ek baar padhein
 Like me, you will start feeling your own story
 akhilesh apane is kitaab ke liye hameshaa yaad kiye jaayenge kyonki yahaan unhone aam aadmi ke marm ko chuaa he

 agar shuruyaat taazgi bhari hogi to, puure din sphurti bani rahegi
 While some habits make you healthy, there are some habits that can make you sick
 aise main ye jaananaa bahut jaruri ho jaataa he ki wo koun se kaam hai jo subah uthne ke baad nahin karne chahie
 Do not do these things in the morning: 1
 dhumrapaan karanaayun to dhumrapaan chahen kisi bhi vakt kiya jaae, nuksaandeh hi hota he lekin subah sokar uthne ke turant baad cigarette pinaa bahut adhik khatarnaak ho saktaa he
 This greatly increases the risk of getting cancer
 kahin aap to nahin rakhte ye chijen frij main? sehat ko ho saktaa he nuksaan2
 Fight should start on a positive day
 subah uthne ke saath hi kisi ke saath ulajh janaa sahi nahin he
 Due to this, your mood will remain bad throughout the day and you will not be able to give your hundred percent in any work
 3
 Spicy food should be avoided while eating too much spicy food
 subah ke samay jitna halkaa or paushtik khaanaa kha saken, utana behatar
 4
 coffee pinaduniya main zyaadaatar log aise hai jo apni subah kii shuruyaat coffee ke cap ke saath karte hai
 But experts believe that drinking coffee in the morning is cortisol (the name of a hormone, which plays an active role in the metabolism of proteins and carbohydrates
 ) level bad jaataa he
 Consuming coffee after starting work is beneficial
 jhadate baalo se dendraf rokane tak, baalo kii har samasya kaa hal he ye tel5
 Staying here and there will be most of us who would not like to get up in the morning
 kuch to aise bhi honge jo subah bistar se uthne ke baad ghar main hi idhar-udhar let jate honge
 This is a wrong habit, due to which you do not feel fresh even after your sleep is complete
 aag se khelnaa khatre se khaali nahin hota or pub main to bilkul bhi nahin
 From liquid nitrogen to fire shots, we are all drinking
 lekin gaison se khelnaa jaanaleva ho saktaa he
 a resident of Delhi zealously drank liquid nitrogen, after which he was admitted to the hospital in Gurugram
 nitrogen pine ke baad vyakti ke pet main chhed ho gaya
 The incident took place two months ago and now the health of the victim has improved significantly
 haa, pet main chhed ho gaya!jitna bhayaavah padhakar lag rahaa he, utana hi doctoron ne ise bataaya
 According to doctors, the stomach of the person drinking nitrogen became like an open book
 hindustan times kii report ke mutabik 30 saal ke vyakti ne drink ke saath liquid nitrogen bhi pi liya
 After drinking, he felt sick, yet he took another drink
 kuch samay baad liquid nitrogen pine vaale vyakti ne asahajata, saans le paane main mushkil or pet main sujan kii shikaayat kii
 He was immediately rushed to the hospital, where doctors started his treatment
 doctoron ne paaya ki uske pet main chhed ho gaya he
 According to the report, the person, on the condition of anonymity, said, 'after taking the first shot i started feeling uncomfortable, as if stomach acid was coming out
 is bich bartender ne ek or drink aage badhaayaa or apana khyaal kiye bina main doosraa drink bhi pi gaya
 However, within minutes my stomach started getting unbearable pain with swelling
 saans lenaa mushkil ho gaya
 'why is Liquid Nitrogen Used in Food Liquid nitrogen is used to quickly freeze food and drinks
 iske saath hi cryogenic medical prakriyaaon main bhi iskaa prayog hota he
 Why should we avoid liquid nitrogen? Liquid nitrogen has a very high expansion ratio of 1: 694
 yani ek litre liquid nitroden gas 20 degree celsius taapmaana par 694 litre kaa vistaar le sakati he
 If the amount of lactic acid in a person's body is very high, then the same can happen to him
 doctoron ne paaya ki is maamle main bhi vyakti ke sharir main lactic acid kii maatra zyada thi jisaki vajah se uske pet main riection hua
 Due to this, there is a lack of oxygen in the stomach of the person and he has to put it on the ventilator
 is maamle main surgery ke dauraan doctoron ne paaya ki vyakti ke pet main ek bada chhed ho gaya tha
 Dr Mrigank s Sharma, who was a co-surgeon in the case, said, "usually, there are small holes in the stomach due to caries, which can be stitched
 lekin is maamle main hamane paaya ki vyakti ke pet ke bich kaa or neeche kaa hissaa kitaab kii tarah khul gaya tha
 It was not possible to sew it
 pet ke kshatigrast hisse ke paas tishyu bhi kharaab ho gaye the
 We had to remove the bad part of the stomach and the rest of the small intestine was added by the doctors

 a lot of films have been made on this issue before but there is no hesitation in saying that the way Ruchir Arun has adopted the film is very new

 Kamal Khan (kamaal r Khan) has tweeted and mentioned his earnings and children
 unka is twit par logon kii pratikriyaayein aani bhi shuru ho gai he
 Kamal Khan often expresses his opinion via tweet and this time he has done something similar
 Now i don't have any problem at all to die anytime

 Hope they will be able to take care of themselves after 30 years
 Kamal r Khan tweeted: "now i will never die, i have no problem, because i will leave so much money for my children that they will not need to do anything for 30 years

 Let us know that Bollywood actor and producer Kamal r Khan lives in Dubai and gives his opinion on every issue with utmost care
 kamaal aar khan big bos (bigg Boss) main bhi najar aa chuke hai
 We are aware of two things at the moment
 congress netaa or shahi parivaar se sambandhit jyotiraditya sindhiya ne apane twitor handle se apni party se sambandhit sari jaankaree hataa lee he
 Now on his Twitter handle it is written that he is only a public servant and a cricket supporter
 isse pehle sindhiya ke twitor handle par likhaa tha ki vah guna se purv saansad hai
 Apart from this, information related to his ministerial post was also on his Twitter handle
 is par sindhiya kaa kahana he ki unhone apane parichay ko twitor handle par isliye chota kiya he jisase vah saral dikhe or ise congress ke saath kisi tarah ke matbhed ke rup main nahin samajha janaa chahie
 He said, 'it was done a month ago to shorten and simplify its introduction
 mujhe is mudde par atakalein lagane waalon par dayaa aati he
 'he told me,' i am a Congress party worker and i have the blood of my father Madhavrao Scindia
 maine apane 17 saal ke kariyar main kisi bhi pad ke liye laalasaa nahin rakhi he
 Due to no explanation related to any appointment, there is increasing talk about taking over as the Congress chief in Madhya Pradesh
 yah rajya un chand rajyon main se ek he jisamen congress satta main he
 Apart from this, there is also the case of those states where the party is in danger due to infiltration among a trio of strong leaders
 sindhiya ke aalochakon kaa kahana he ki sarkaar ko siem ke rup main kamalnath or purv siem digvijay singh sanchalit kar rahe hai or sindhiya jo kamalnath ke khilaaf siem pad kii ummidavaari par apana daawa nahin thok sake, wo party chhodane par vichaar kar rahe hai
 It alerts Indian politicians to say sadness, anger and to speak their mind through social media and mainly Twitter
 udhaaharan sharad pavaar, ajit pavaar or supriya sule hai
 Therefore, the speculation that Scindia is sending telegraph to the Congress in less than 30 characters or less is justified
 is maheene, upachunaav main jhabua seat jitkar congress madhyapradesh vidhansabha main 115 ke saadhaaran bahumat tak pahunchane main safal rahi
 The BJP has 107 members
 isliye congress kii pakad kuch bhi ho lekin vah surakshit he or sindhiya or unke samarthakon dwaara kisi bhi tarah kaa vidroh vipatti kaa kaaran hoga
 However, many senior leaders of Madhya Pradesh who spoke for this column, dismissed any threat to the Kamal Nath government by Scindia's supporters
 sindhiya ke kam se kam 10 vidhayak unke prati kaaphi vishwaas rakhte hai
 a party leader jokingly said, "forget 15, Maharaj (pinching on Scindia's royal legacy) won't even have two mlas
 ek vyakti jo apana aadhaar kho chukaa he, vah sirf bhaajapa ko dosha dene kaa kaaran dhundhna chahta he
 Don't forget that most of his family are in BJP
 ham jaanate hai ki vah amit shah ke sampark main hai, jise divangat arun jetali dwaara suvidhajanak banaaya gaya tha
 "as with most things currently in Congress, the situation is extremely complex
 maine pehle sindhiya ko ek kollam main yahaan khoe hue ladakon main se ek ke rup main varnit kiya tha, jo peter pan kaa anuyaayi tha, vah ladkaa jisane bade hone se inkaar kar diya tha
 Rahul Gandhi is ex-congress president Peter Pan, and the lost boys are leaders whose own careers have stalled as a result of rg's half-baked leadership
 sindhiya gandhi ke kareebi mitra hai, phir bhi pichley saal disambar main kamalnath ko madhya pradesh kaa mukhyamantri banane par vah naaraaz the
 He has gone public several times with his displeasure, with public differences with Rahul Gandhi over the removal of Article 370 in Kashmir, but the party largely ignored him
 haalanki unhone congress ke saath apane sambandhon ko puri tarah se jalaayaa nahin he, sindhiya ne spasht rup se purv main jaahir kiya tha ki vah sthaneey congress pramukh bananaa chaahate hai, ek pad abhi bhi kamalnath ke paas he, saath hi saath rajyasabha seat bhi he taaki ve sansad main apana rasta bana saken
 Kamal Nath, who agrees to Scindia on his full eclipse in the mp's power equation, met the first Congress president, Sonia Gandhi, for the post of mp's Congress chief
 lekin congress ke varisht netaa bataate hai, kabhi-kabhi congress main koi nirnay nahin hota he
 It is also a decision
 uljhan main? mat ho
 In the politics of the Byzantine court of the Congress, Scindia has a strong rivalry with former Digvijay Singh, who still holds a major command over the party apparatus and who vetoed Scindia for the head of state
 gandhi sirf trikoniya ladaai ko santulit karne kii koshish kar rahe hai
 Scindia's supporters say he should be made the head of state to protect his camp
 yah bhi ek pratikriya he kyonki singh ne sindhiya ko gwalior ke garh se baahar nikaal diya he
 Singh is a great supporter of Kamal Nath and is called "super CM" in Bhopal
 sindhiya kaa sangharsh congress ke puraane sangrakshak banaam yang turkon ke adhikansh satta sangharsh ko darshata he
 a similar story is unfolding in Rajasthan with repeated skirmishes between Sachin Pilot and Ashok Gehlot
 rahul gandhi, jo abhi-abhi videsh se ek '' dhyaan '' se laute hai, abhi bhi ruthe hue hai
 Old Congress guards are not allowing young leaders to move forward
 yadi congress antat maharashtra main shivasena or sharad pavaar ke saath gathbandhan karne main sarkaar banaati he, to puraane diggaj apane kaam ko jari rakhenge
 Despite this, many things are happening on social media

 madhya pradesh main vande maataram gane ko lekar siyasat ke galiyaaron main halchal machi hui he
 Chief Minister and Congress leader Kamal Nath was forced to reverse his stand amid constant attacks and pressure from the BJP
 unhone kaha he ki ab police band ke saath vandemaataram kaa gayan hoga
 Let us know that according to the tradition of Vande Mataram till now, this collective anthem has been done in the presence of the minister or the Chief Secretary in the ministry premises
 is bich, 1 janvari ko bhopal main mantralay ke saamne udyaan main samuhik vande maataram na gaae jane ke baad kamalnath sarkaar ghir gai thi
 However, now Kamal Nath has taken a U-turn
 unhone kaha, 'bhopal main ab aakarshak swaroop main police band or aam logon kii sahabhaagita ke saath vandemaataram kaa gayan hoga
 At 10:45 am on the first working day of every month, the police band will march from Shaurya Smarak to Vallabh Bhavan, playing melodies that awaken the national spirit
 'shivaraj kaa elaan- main gaaungaa, phir jhuke kamalnathsaal ke pehle din vande maataram kaa gaan nahin hone ke baad pradesh ke purv mukhyamantri or bhaajapa netaa shivaraj singh chouhan ne maamle ko haathon-haath lapak liya or congress par tabad-tod hamale shuru kar die
 After all, he asked, on whose direction did the tradition of singing Vande Mataram be broken
 shivaraj ne kaha, 'agar congress ko raashtra geet ke shabd nahin aate hai yaa phir raashtra geet ke gayan main shame aati he, to mujhe bataa den
 On the first date of every month, i will sing Vande Mataram with the public in the courtyard of Vallabh Bhavan
 '2005 se gaaya ja rahaa tha vande maataramshivraj ne sawaal uthaaya ki aakhir kiski sahmati va rajamandi se 1 janvari ko vande maataram kaa samooh gaan nahin hua
 He announced that all BJP mlas will sing collective Vande Mataram on January 7
 gyaat ho ki varsh 2005 main tatkaaleen mukhyamantri babulal gaur ke kaaryalamein har maheene kii pehali taarikh ko samuhik vande maataram gayan kii shuruyaat kii gai thi
 This series had been going on continuously for the last 13 years, but the first date after the change of power, that is, January 1, did not take place in the Vallabh Bhavan premises
 isse sarkaar vivaadon main ghir gai
 The pro-congregation Vande Mataram Anthem of the Congress piecemeal gang is organized by the General Administration Department
 vartmaan main yah vibhaag mukhyamantri kamalnath ke paas he, lihaaja bhaajapa ne sidhe taur par kamalnath par hamale tej kar die
 BJP said, 'chief Minister Kamal Nath has stopped singing Vande Mataram from January 1 and has given the New Year gift to the patriotic citizens of the state
 lekin aisa karke congress party or kamalnath ne aane vaale loksabhaa chunaav kaa agenda set kar diya he
 The Kamal Nath government's move has made it clear that due to vote bank politics, the Congress and Kamal Nath will provide political patronage to the gang that shouted slogans of India
 'is maamle ke tool pakadaney baad kamalnath ko safai deni padi
 He said, 'we also have faith in religion, nationality, patriotism
 congress party, jisane desh kii aazaadee kii ladaai ladi, use deshbhakti, rashtriyata ke liye kisi se bhi praaanpatr kii aavashyaktaa nahin he
 Do not do politics on the BJP, will implement it (singing Vande Mataram) in a new form
 'bhaajapa ne gaaya samuhik vande maatarammadhya pradesh main mantralay parisar main samuhik taur par vandemaataram gane kii 13 saal puraani parampara par aghoshit roak lagaae jane ke virodh main bhaajapa ne buudhvaar ko mantralay ke saamne sthit udyaan main samuhik vande maataram kaa gayan yojit kiya
 The BJP, while opposing the ban on collective Vande Mataram singing on the 1st of every month, sang Vande Mataram in a garden close to the ministry
 saath hi purv mukhyamantri chouhan ne ek twit main likhaa, 'main or bhaajapa ke samast vidhayak vidhansabha satr ke pehle din 7 janvari ko subah 10 baje vallabh bhawan ke praangan main vande maataram kaa gaan karenge
 All of you are welcome to join this campaign
 'chouhan ne aage kaha, 'congress shaayad yah bhul gai he ki sarkarein aati he, jaati he lekin desh or deshbhakti se upar kuch nahin he
 i demand that the anthem of Vande Mataram be in the courtyard of Vallabh Bhavan as always before every cabinet meeting and on the first date of every month
 'haalanki, chaaron taraf se khud ko ghirta dekh kamalnath ne maamle par you-turn lete hue yah elaan kiya ki ab se police band ke saath vande maataram kaa gaan hoga

 pune ke deccan college dimd vishvavidhyalay ke puratatvavidon ko khudaai ke dauraan ek yuva jode kaa kankal mila tha
 At the time of death, both of them must have been between 21 and 35 years old
 khudaai ke dauraan donon ek hi kabr main mili or purush kankal kaa cheharaa mahila kii taraf tha
 This skeleton is said to be 4,500 years old of the Harappan civilization at Rakhigarhi in Haryana
 yah kankal 2016 main mila tha lekin is par research chal rahi thi
 In the research it was being ascertained what the meaning of burying the couple together
 do saal research ke baad ab puratatvvid kuch kehane kii sthiti main pahunche hai
 According to archaeologists, the way the couple's skeletal burials are evident shows that the two were in love
 ye sirf sambhaavna he
 Those who would have buried both wanted the two to remain in love even after they died
 unhone kaha ki, kapal ko dafnane kaa aisa maamla pracheen sabhyataaon main durlabh nahin he
 The couple's grave has also found pottery and a welt-like akyak, which may have been part of the woman's jewelery
 is tarah dafnane kaa pehla maamalayah pehali baar he jab hadappa sabhyataa kii khudaai ke dauraan kisi yugal kii kabr mili he
 Surprisingly, so far many cemeteries belonging to the Harappan civilization have been excavated, but till date no such burial of any couple was reported
 haryana kaa rakhigadhi dilli se 150 kilometre uttar-pashchim main sthit he
 Archaeologists said the evidence found during the excavation suggests that the couple is buried at the same time because no evidence has been found that one was buried first, then the other

 The Pune Honorary University has published full details of this discovery in the international journal ACB Journal of Anatomy and Cell Biology

 This suggests that the two may have been buried together during their youth

 On Saturday morning, Devendra Fadnavis again took oath as CM of Maharashtra

 The leaders of the three parties prepared the blueprint of the government, which party would have how many ministers, it was decided

 But amidst all this developments, many questions arise as to how this entire game came to an end
 kya sharad pavaar ne bijepi sang gathbandhan ko sahmati di
 Was the BJP and NCP talks already or has Ajit Pawar become a rebel? To this, news agency ANI quoted sources as saying that Sharad Pawar was part of the talks of the Devendra Fadnavis-led coalition government
 unhone hi ajit pavaar ko aage badhane kii manjuuri di
 Sources also said that Ajit Pawar is the leader of the ncp's parliamentary party and no decision in the party can be taken without Sharad Pawar's approval
