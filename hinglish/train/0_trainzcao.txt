 Bundelkhand, known as the 'land of heroes', has carved out an identity like Vidarbha of Maharashtra in the country

 dinakar ne kaha ki basapa ghoshnaa par nahin, kaam par bharosa karti he
 If the BSP comes to power in this election, exodus will be considered as the main issue

 roj takreeban 20 karod log neend se jaagate hi sabase pehle smartphone par whotsap check karte hai or ek duusare ke saath "good morning sandesh'', tasviren, video aadi share karte hai
 It is a powerful medium for dissemination of information used by the government and the public, with the group chat feature, one click can be sent to all the members of the group simultaneously with one click

 Spreading rumors through whatsapp has also become easier because people are forgetting to think of it as a source of information rather than just an information sharing platform

 However the current provisions of the IT Act and the IPC are adequate to deal with such incidents

 Says Nappinai, "there should be a rational use of the law and its provisions - within limits and where needed, not to strangulate one's freedom of expression

 As soon as the project was ready to be sent to CCS in April 2015, the PMO again posed the same question, can LDP be converted into a Make in India project? The matter has been pending with the Secretary of Defense since July

 The Indian farmer is already facing tremendous pressure on many fronts and the increased tax burden will dent his income

 If any political party tries to take over the law and order of the country, then we are ready to answer it in every way

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh made it clear that he is not blindly trusting his Pakistani counterpart Yusuf Raza Gilani and that Pakistan's armed forces also agreed in the peace process between the two countries
 unhone kaha ki bharat pakistan kii asainya sarkaar ke haath majboot karnaa chahta he or gilaani spasht rup se samaj chuke hai ki mumbai jaisaa ek or hamalaa shanti prakriya ke liye bahut bada jhatka hoga
 Gilani had called Gilani a man of peace during his visit to Male on Thursday
 singh ne maldive se lautate samay vishesh vimaan main samvaadadaataaon ke sawaalon kaa jawaab dete hue kaha ki bharat paak shanti prakriya kai ghatnaon kaa shikaar rahi he
 He said that his visit to Pakistan would only happen when Pakistan would take concrete steps against those accused in the Mumbai terror attack
 singh ne kaha ki main is maamle main vistaar se nahin janaa chaahunga lekin jab maine pakistan ke pradhanmantri ke saath baatcheet kii ki pakistan ke sashastr balon kii (vaarta prakriya) main sahmati he tab maine ek lambey samay ke baad mahasoos kiya ki pakistan ke sashastr bal bhi is prakriya main saath hai
 When he was asked about Pakistan's Foreign Minister Hina Rabbani Khar's claim that the army had agreed to a peace initiative with India, but when Singh was asked about what he called Geelani as a man of peace, he said That he has met him four or five times and both have repeatedly discussed bilateral issues, during the discussion, his counterparts agreed that all problems were calm There is no way other than a full resolution and does not help in this process by terrorism
 unhone kaha ki main vishwaas kar saktaa hum ki pakistan main ek loktantric sarkaar he
 We should strengthen the hands of this democratic government
 singh ne kaha ki dwipaksheeya sambandhon or vyapaar ko saamaanya banane tathaa aatankwaad sambandhi muddon par aage badhane kii apni ichha ko lekar main sochataa hum ki gilaani ke rup main pakistan ke paas aisa pradhanmantri he jo hamaare saath kaam karne ko taiyaar he
 When asked about believing in Gilani, the Prime Minister said that it is not that Snow is blindly believing anyone, no matter how sensible he is
 pradhanmantri gilaani or main sambandhon ko saamaanya banane main vishwaas karte hai
 He said that he and Gilani agreed that the second round of talks should begin and the way Pakistan has demonstrated its changed approach by giving India the status of a top priority country and willing to negotiate on all issues including terrorism Therefore, for the development of trade relations, a second round of negotiations is necessary
 unhone kaha ki atev, main is ummid ke saath lautaa hum ki pakistan ke saath vaarta kaa doosraa daur sheeghra hi shuru hoga lekin us baatcheet kaa kya parinaam hoga, main philhal nahin kah saktaa kyonki bharat-paak sambandh ghatnaon se prabhavit hote hai
 Singh said that both of us accepted that if another incident like Mumbai attack happened, it would be a big shock
 main sochataa hum ki is baat ko pradhanmantri gilaani bhi bhaleebhanti samajhate hai
 The Prime Minister said he made it clear to his Pakistani counterpart that the Indian public was not satisfied with Pakistan's action against those responsible for the Mumbai attacks
 unhone kaha ki jab tak tak is mudde par koi pragati nahin hoti he, shanti prakriya aage nahin bad sakati he
 He said that Pakistan is ready to send a judicial commission to India and the outline of its visit is being prepared and after that i hope that some progress will be made
 unke or gilaani ke nayaa adhyay shuru karne ke bayaan par puche jane par singh ne kaha ki niyantran rekha ke paar vishwaas bahaali ke anya upayon ke saath hi vyapaar udaarikaran ek bahut bada utsahvardhak kadam ho saktaa he or niyantran rekha ke paar ke logon ke jivan main sudhaar aa saktaa he
 Singh also said that Pakistan believes that no one in the world will accept terrorism as a government policy and that it will not solve any problem
 unhone kaha ki aatankwaad ne pakistan kii chhavi ko nuksaan pahunchaaya he
 He said that Pakistan has been told that it will have to deal with terrorism strictly and i think this is another area where both countries can move forward but at the same time they also said that India's initiative towards Pakistan It is believed that we believe, but the entire investigation is tested
 jab unase poocha gaya ki vishwaas or jaanch parakh kii yah prakriya kitni vaastavik he, singh ne kaha ki jis din bharat ko is baat kaa thos saboot mil jayega ki pakistan aatankwaadi karravaayiyon ko shah dene main laga he, vah bilkul nakaaratmak sanket bhejega
 When the Prime Minister was asked if he had agreed to visit Pakistan, he said that whenever Gilani meets him, he invites him to visit, but i have also said that the right time for this visit Will come when concrete steps will be taken from Pakistan against terrorism

 The Delhi Police has arrested a man named Akash, who plotted the murder and robbery of an elderly couple
 akaash peshey se nurse he
 After taking a nursing course from Gwalior, Arapiyakash first worked in two private hospitals
 phir usne dilli kaa rukh kiya
 Arriving here, Akash sought work through a homecare organization
 jald hi akaash ko kaam mil gaya
 Actually, the elderly couple from South Delhi were looking for a mail nurse to look after them
 akaash ko vahiin kaam mila
 The elderly are 92 years and 85 years old
 inke bachche videsh main rahete hai, paison kii koi kami nahin he
 So both of them hired the mail nurse at home
 lekin unhen jaraa bhi andaja nahin tha ki jo ladkaa unhone apni dekhbhaal ke liye rakhaa he, wo kitna shaatir or khatarnaak he
 Within a few days of working, Akash came to know that the elderly couple are rich
 inke ghar par lutpaat main bahut sara maal mil saktaa he, bas akaash ne itawa main rahane vaale apane bahanoi se sampark kiya
 According to the police, the brother-in-law of Akash is a man of criminal tendency
 akaash ke bahanoi ne akaash ko ek pistal bhi diya
 Together they told him to quit his job so that the police suspects him after the incident
 akaash 31 may ko naukari chhod kar agle hafte apni sajeesh ko anjaam tak pahunchane kii firaaq main tha
 His plan was to kill both the elders and loot the house
 lekin akaash kii issajishaka pataa police ke ek mubir ko lag gaya
 The informer revealed the conspiracy to the police
 iske baad police harakat main aa gai
 First the police put Akash's phone on surveillance
 puri sajeesh kaa khulaasa hote hi police ne akaash ko daboch liya
 Police also recovered a pistol and four live cartridges from near Akash
 ab police akaash ke bahanoi kii talash main juty he
 The revelations of this incident saved the lives of two elders
 rus or france ke hamale se syria main pehle hi iesas ke paanv ukhdane lage the
 Now Britain too
 is jang main kud padaa he
 Here, Prime Minister David Cameron ordered the attack to the Royal Air Force, and the Tornado Fighter jets began writing a new story of the ruin in Syria
 isse pehle britain kii sansad main aies ke khilaaf hawaii hamale karne yaa naa karne ke sawaal par lambii bahes hui
 And finally the British Parliament allowed the attack
 jameen par tabadatodbamon kii barishaur asaman main udaan bharte britain ke royal airforce ke tonerdo fiter jetts
 This is the latest picture of the war against ISIS in Syria
 wo tasviir jisamen britain ab bilkul active role main najar aa he
 How important the decision of Britain is, can be gauged from the fact that the British Parliament did a tremendous task for the entire ten and a half hours to bomb the ISIS bases in Syria
 iske baad kahin jaakar jab hamale ke hakamen 223 ke mukaable 397 vot pade, tab britain ke pradhanmantri david camran ne royal airforce ko hamale kaa hukum diya
 Opponents had given this how confused Britain was about the attack in Tarsaria, it can be gauged from the fact that they had to appeal very passionately to take mps with them
 pradhanmantri david camran ne kaha, kya hamen apane sahyogiyon ke saath aise aatankwaadiyon ko tabah karne ke liye ladanaa chahie
 The Or should we enter the house of such terrorists and kill them? Or should we silently wait for that moment when they attack us? However, the opponents were constantly arguing that the Syrian people were already very upset by the attacks happening there and now in this fight, Britain is renewed
 Jumping will add to their troubles
 bahut mumkin he ki aatankwaadiyon ke saath-saath aam log or khaas kar mahilaayein or bachche bhi iskaa shikaar ban jaaen
 But ultimately, Parliament gave the decision in favor of the attack
 britain ke is faisle se aayaa nayaa molmerica ne iesas ke khilaaf morche kii shuruyaat to kaaphi pehle kar di thi
 Neto country was also supporting America in this
 lekin paris par pichley 13 november ko hueaissake hamale ke baad duniya ke kai aise mulkon ne bhi sidhe taur par iesas se takaraane kaa faisla kar liya, jo ab tak parde ke peeche se is ladaai main shaamil the
 Russia was also bombing Syria for about a month and a half on the feast of Syrian President Bashar al-assad, but after the attack on France, France itself decided to join Russia in this fight
 duusare vishwa yuddh ke baad ye pehla mauka tha, jab france or rus ek saath mil kar apane kisi dushman ko nishaanaa bana rahe the
 But now the latest turn from this case has come from the decision of Britain, as Britain has also started attacking ISIS bases in Syria directly with countries like France and Russia
 syria main iesas ke thikaanon par jari roosi bambaari se baukhalaaye aatankwaadiyon ne
 Once again, he crossed all limits of hatred
 apni khooni ravaayat par chalate hue is baar unhone ek roosi jasoos kaa naa sirf sir kalam kar diya, balki hameshaa kii tarah
 His video was also put on social site
 lekin pehle ke video se alag is nae clip main
 The terrorist was speaking not in English or Arabic but in Russian
 8 minute ke video ne yaad dilaayaa jihadi jonnfrat kii sari hadon se aage nikal kar apane hi jaise insaanon kaa galaa kaatane ke liye badnaam iesas ke aatankwaadiyon ne ab khauf kaa ek or video jari kiya he
 This time this video is of such a Russian spy
 jiske bare main kaha ja rahaa he ki wo syria main rah kar rus ke liess kii jasusikar rahaa tha
 This video, shot on the banks of a river or lake, is reminiscent of the jihadist John, who started this bloody ritual on behalf of ISIS
 lekin is video or jon ke video main jo sabase bada fark he, wo he is baar sir kalam karanevaale iesas ke aatankwaadi kaa apana cheharaa khulaa rakhana
 This ISIS militant standing in a military veneer has taken a knife in his hand, which is usually used by commandos
 or 8 minute ke is video main apane shikaar kii jaan lene se pehle wo russian language main hi rus kaa dhamkata najar aa rahaa he
 Moreover, the open-faced terrorist also takes the name of Russian President Vladimir Putin and says that Russia will find it overwhelming to attack ISIS bases in Syria on the call of Syrian President Bashar al-assad
 ye he aatankwaadi kii khuli dhamkiatankwaadi ne kaha, 'russian log, tum pachhataaoge or tumhen niraash hona hoga
 We want to tell you that the Russian attack in Syria will strengthen our intentions
 tum apane gharon main bhi chaiyn se nahin ho paaoge
 We will kill your children as you are killing our children in Syria
 jaise tum syria main hamaare ghar ujaad rahe ho, ham bhi vaise hi tumhaare ghar ujaad denge
 'ISIS has broken all the limits of impunity, the process of killing hostages in Iraq and Syria since 21 August 2014 has continued unabated till date
 in donon deshon memm pichley 10 maheenon se katleam chal rahaa he
 No one knows the exact count of the dead bodies, and no one can even tell when the terrorists who have been isolated from Baghdadi will stop
 ab to iraq or syria ke registani ilaakon kii tapati ret par insaanon kii laashen milanaa rosemara kii baat ho chali he
 But the question is still the same
 sawaal ye ki aakhir ye video or begunaah logon ko maarane silsla kab tak yunhi chalata rahegaa or aakhir kab tak iesas ke aatankwaadi duniya ko you hin dahalaate rahenge

 ujama ne paak main apane upar hue atyaachaar kii puri kahani sunai or kaha ki paak maut kaa kuan he
 Uzma said that the person from Pakistan fraudulently married me
 vahaan mujhe dhamkiyaan di gayi

 unhone kaha ki paak janaa bahut aasaan he lekin vahaan se waapas nikal kar aana bahut mushkil
 Pakistan is a death well

 He said that the number of thanks to Sushma Maam is less
 unka mujhe phone aata tha ki tum bharat kii beti ho
 Nothing will happen to you wo hameshaa tasalli detii rahati thim jisase mujhe bada hausala mila
 Uzma said that Muslim girls who think that Pakistan is good, but those who go there by arranging marriage are also crying
 wo bhi chaahati hai ki kisi tarah se india aa jaaen
 There are two-three-four wives in each house
 yahaan jo bhi he, freedom he
 i am proud of this country
 pakistan main mahilaayein chhodie vahaan to aadmi bhi sef nahin he
 Sushma Swaraj said that the story of Uzma is heard from Uzma

 Uzma was thanking me again and again
 lekin main apana ferj adaa kar rahi thi
 He said, 'you trusted the Indian High Commission in a crisis

 Dhoni, who went to Arizona for Winning Ways Charity of Riti Sports, has been praised by the then Governor Doug Ducey
 tippaniyan He said that Dhoni resembles Pat Tillman, an American braveheart
 purv america footballar pat tillman ne iraq or afghanistan ke abhiyaanon main hissaa liya or apni jaan ganvaa di
 After returning from the US, Dhoni is ready for his first home match after eight years
 dhoni alur (karnataka) main hone vaali vijay hazaare trophy ke is match main captain varun aron kii aguai main khilne ko taiyaar hai
 Dhoni, a 34-year-old cricket superstar, took part in the Mushtaq Ali Trophy in 2007, eight years before that
 yah na keval jharkhand ke cricketron ke liye balki jammu-kashmir ke cricket khilaadiyon ke liye bhi bada mauka sabit ho saktaa he
 Players from both teams will not want to miss this opportunity to learn from MSD
 unhone kaha ki dhoni ek america jaanbaaj pat tillman jaise lagate hai
 Former American footballer Pat Tillman took part in campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan and lost his life
 america se lautakar dhoni aath saal baad apane pehle gharelu match ke liye taiyaar ho gaye hai
 Dhoni is set to play in the Vijay Hazare Trophy in Alur (karnataka), led by captain Varun Aron
 34 saal ke cricket ke superstar dhoni ne isse 8 saal pehle 2007 main mushtak ali trophy main hissaa liya tha
 This can prove to be a big opportunity not only for the cricketers of Jharkhand but also for the cricket players of Jammu and Kashmir

 The semi-finals of the World Cup have always been very exciting
 is baar bhi aisa hi kuch hua
 i am very happy that New Zealand have been successful in reaching the final for the first time and the credit for this should be given to the captaincy of Brendon mccullum
 unhone bade akramak tareeke se ek aisi team kii captaini kii he, jiske bare main kisi bhi jaankaar ne yahaan tak pahunchane kii ummid nahin kii thi
 The final of the World Cup-2015 is in equal teams, but i think we can get a winner this time, who will take the World Cup home for the first time
 bhartiya team ke bhagya ne saath nahin diya
 He won all the matches with ease before the semi-finals, but eventually lost to the semi-finalists, who had come back to Australia
 steve smith ne australia kii pari kii shuruyaat main hi is match ko chin liya tha
 The Indian bowlers had started well, but they also bowled a few loose balls, which Smith did not hesitate to take advantage of
 airan finch apni lay nahin pakad sake lekin unhone smith kaa bharpoor saath diya
 It was not his best performance, but he would probably count it in his best innings
 bhartiya gendbaajon or fielderon ne kadi mehnat karke australia ko 328 ranon par roak diya, jo ek pratispardhi score tha
 However at one time it seemed that Australia's score could reach 350 runs
 hamaare khiladinnon ne glen maxwell, finch or maaikel clark ke wicket lekar match ko waapas apni taraf kar liya tha, lekin mishael johnson ke tejatarraar 27 ranon ne bada fark laa diya, jisaki vajah se australia ne ek majboot score khadaa kar diya
 India made a solid start and the openers batted well and sensibly
 unhone saavdhaanee or akramakata kaa acha talmail dikhaaya
 But we were able to score 22 runs between the 15th and 22nd overs, while in the meantime we lost three precious wickets
 or yaheen se match australia kii ore jhuk gaya
 Dhoni and Rahane could not speed up the scoring as wickets fell quickly and the task became even more difficult for the rest of the batsmen after Rahane was out of whack
 nokout charnon main kaaphi kuch ho chukaa he
 The quarter-finals and semi-final matches have shown that the more the talent and ability of players test this stage of the World Cup, the more it weighs up their morale
 agar mujhe chaar quarter finelon or do semifinalon main tulana kerani ho to sabase rochak pahalu yah tha ki kis tarah prayek team ne jarurat ke samay pradarshan kiya
 The Sri Lankan team lost wickets in the quarter-finals, giving the rival team a chance to completely dominate themselves
 natijatan vishwa cap kaa uskaa safar vahiin tham gaya
 Before that Sri Lanka team was performing very well in the tournament
 or khaskar kumaar sangakaara to nihaayat umdaa ballebaaji kar rahe the
 His bowlers were also bowling well
 badakismati se dakshin africa ke khilaaf unka ek kharaab din rahaa
 It was sad to see that the South African team could not continue their performance in the semi-finals and proved to be weak against New Zealand, although the match was full of thrill until the final over
 cricket ke itihaas main isaki ginati kuch behad romaanchak muqablon main kii jaaegi
 Grant Elliott turned the game over
 newjiland ab apane is aatmavishvaas kaa istemaal final main australia ke khilaaf bakhubi karegaa
 Morale played a key role in the victory of some teams and the defeat of some teams
 newjiland ne semifinal mukaable main najuk samay main apana manobal banaae rakhaa
 i have sympathy with South Africa, who faced it bravely, but once again remained a step away from the final
 main kalpana kar saktaa hum ki is team ko kitna dukh hua hoga
 a
 bi
 De Villiers captained the entire tournament wisely and the batsmen and bowlers of this team performed well at the time of need, but some important mistakes proved to be too expensive for them
 isi tarah dhoni or unke khiladinnon ko is baat kii badhai di jaani chahie ki unhone puure toornament main acha khel dikhaaya or jeet hasil karte rahe
 We should also remember that South Africa's brilliant performance in the quarter-finals marked the tragic end of the careers of two great players Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene
 donon hi bahut kushal ballebaaj hai, jinhone apane puure kariyar main bahut sadha hua pradarshan kiya
 Apart from some great performances, he also played some very memorable partnerships, which are excellent examples in themselves
 jaisaa e
 B
 ne ekadam sahi baat kahi, suraj ugta he or jindagi chalati rahati he
 The careers of some great players do not end well, while they deserve praise
 2011 ke vishwa cap ke final kii yaaden mujhe hameshaa khushi se bhar detii hai, jabaki 2003 kaa final dukhadaayi rahaa, jisamen ham australia se haar gaye the
 Playing in the final of the World Cup is a unique experience, which is no match
 jab aap vahaan tak pahunchate hai to uskaa alag hi romaanch hota he
 But that thrill quickly turns into panic and pressure
 or jab aap jeet jate hai to apaar khushi hoti he
 On the other hand, no one has to experience grief as much as they feel sorry for losing the final
 lekin is mahaan khel kii yahi to hakeekat he
 After going through both experiences, i am happy that South Africa lost in the semi-finals
 vishwa cap ke final main haarane kii apeksha pehle hi haar kaa munh dekhnaa kahin zyada acha he
 The same applies in the case of India
 bhartiya khilaadi final main pahunchakar vahaan haar kaa saamana karen, yah mujhe acha nahin lagata
 i can imagine how nervous and happy New Zealand must have been after reaching the final for the first time
 nishchit rup se australia ko gharelu maidan par khilne kaa phayda milegaa
 But we cannot underestimate New Zealand at all
 unhone puure toornament main shandaar cricket khelaa he or unke liye itihaas rachane kaa mauka he
 While we await a blistering performance from both the teams, we should also praise the other teams who have done well in this World Cup, especially India, South Africa and Sri Lanka deserves praise
 yah baat bhi yaad rakhane vaali he ki 2011 se pehle kisi bhi team ne apane gharelu maidan par vishwa cap jeetne kaa gaurav hasil nahin kiya tha
 In the last World Cup, two host countries had reached the final and the team which had the advantage of home ground was victorious
 is baar bhi do mejabaan desh final main pahunche hai
 We hope that only the better team wins

 jammu kashmir par vaarta prakriya ko badhaane ke liye ‚Äò‚Äòchote-chote kadamon‚Äô‚Äô kii vakaalat karte hue kendriya vaartakaron ne buudhvaar ko kaha ki raajnneetik kaidiyon, pathar phenkane waalon ko reeha karne ke saath karfu hataane se sthiti ko behatar banane main kaaphi madad milegi
 After a four-day visit to Kashmir, a three-member negotiating team led by noted journalist Dilip Padgaonkar reached Jammu
 is bich, pradesh bhaajapa ne kaha ki vah jammu kashmir main vibhinn pakshon se baat karne ke liye centre dwaara niyukt vaartakaron kaa bahishkaar karegi
 BJP state unit chief Shamsher Singh Manhas said that the party has taken this decision in view of the 'hurtful' remarks made by the interlocutors, especially Dilip Padgaonkar
 unhone kaha ki vaartakaron kii tippaniyon se unki vishwasaneeyata ke prati andeh paidaa ho gaya he
 The remarks of the interlocutors have hurt the sentiments of the nationalist forces in the state
 bhaajapa ne vaartakaron ke jail main band logon or hurriyat netaaon se milane par bhi aapatti vyakt kii
 At the same time, the Center-appointed negotiator for Kashmir will talk to the BJP leadership on the issue of autonomy resolution passed in the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly in 2000
 padaganvkar ne kaha, ‚Äò‚Äòham dilli lautne ke baad swaittata sankalp par bhaajapa netaa laalkrishna adwani se milenge or yah pataa karenge ki sankalp kyon khaarij hua
 However, the negotiators said that apart from interacting with people of all views in the state, they have a big responsibility to take all the parties in the country into confidence
 teen sadasyeey samiti kaa netritv kar rahe dilip padaganvkar ne yahaan samvaadadaataaon se khuli baatcheet main kaha, ‚Äò‚Äò yadi desh ke raajnneetik mat kaa netritv karne vaali sansad ko vishwaas main nahin liya jaataa to prayaas vyarth ho jayega 
 We know that this is a big obligation, but it has to be done
 ‚Äô‚Äôpadaganvkar ne kaha ki samgr or sthai samaadhaan dhundhane ke prayaas ke tahat kashmir main samaaj ke vibhinn tabakon ke saath chaar divasiy baatcheet ke dauraan vaartakaron ko kaaphi moolyawaan jaankaree mili
 He said, "we heard political views on Kashmir and also came to know about the problems faced by people such as not being able to roam freely or getting milk for children
" ‚Äô‚Äô unhone kaha ki team ke rajya ke pehle daure ke baad kisi ko bhi bade kadamon kii ummid nahin kerani chahie or ‚Äò‚Äòham vaarta prakriya ko aage badhaane ke liye chote chote kadam uthaaenge
 Padgaonkar said that after similar talks in Jammu today and tomorrow, the group will recommend the Center to improve the situation in the state
 unhone kaha ki vaartakar rajya main aane ke pehle bhaajapa netaa se milanaa chaahate the lekin adwani kii vyastata ke kaaran aisa sambhav nahin ho sakaa
 At that time, the National Conference had a two-thirds majority in the Assembly and the House passed that resolution in July 2000
 lekin centre sarkaar ne use khaarij kar diya tha jabaki neshnal conference us samay rajg sarkaar main shaamil thi
 Padgaonkar said that he would demand an Action Report (ATR) of the recommendations of the five working groups formed in 2006 by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to consider various aspects of the Kashmir issue
 unhone kaha, ‚Äò‚Äò tatkaal raajnneetik bandiyon, patharav karne waalon kii rihaai or kaphryu hataanaa sheersh praathamiktaaon main he

 "the fact is that a resolution passed by Parliament (to withdraw the Pakistani-occupied part of Jammu and Kashmir) makes Pakistan a party," he said
 ‚Äô‚Äô Congress leader Jyotiraditya Scindia has said that party vice president Rahul Gandhi has the best ability to lead both the Congress and the country and he wants Rahul to take over as the party president tomorrow

 During this session, Himanta said that party workers have worked hard for this victory
 iske alaava north east ke logon kaa desh ke anya hisse ke logon kii tarj par sochna he ki bijepi ke paas desh main vikaas kaa vijan he or vah is vijan se alag nahin rahanaa chaahate
 On the question of quitting the Congress, Hemant said that after joining the BJP, till the preparations for the Assam elections, i had to take revenge
 lekin ab vah bhaavana mere andar nahin he
 Our effort today is to bring the entire North East into the mainstream of development
 vahiin pradhanmantri narendra modi ko pasand karne kii baat par himanta ne kaha ki congress ke kisi netaa se puuchhie ki kya unhone kabhi sonia gandhi yaa rahul gandhi ke saath dinar par baatcheet kii he
 Hemant said because it is not a part of Congress culture
 vahiin bijepi main amit shah ke dianing room kaa darwaja khulaa rahata he or vah logon kaa khule man se swaagat karte hai
 Hemant said that he or his chief minister never got such an opportunity in the Congress party
 aisa mauka milane par north east ke netaaon ke liye kshetra kii dikkaton ko alaakaman tak pahunchane kaa kaam aasaan hota
 But there has never been such a culture in the Congress that senior leadership talks with party leaders on a personal level
 himanta ne kaha ki north east main bijepi kaa kshetreey raajnneeti main dakhl na dene or kshetreey netaaon ko apni party main shaamil nahin karne kaa phayda mila he
 According to Himanta, party president Amit Shah believes that he will try to develop the region by staying in alliance with regional parties in the North East 
 isse kshetreey partiyon ko ek sens of security mili or bijepi elliance ne north east main acha kaam kiya he
 On the other hand, the Congress party has acted as an encroachment on the vote share of the regional party and that is why the regional parties of the North East look at the Congress suspiciously
 himanta ne kaha ki congress chhodane ke baad unhone congress ke sabhi netaaon ke paas jaakar bijepi main shaamil hone kii baat kahi
 Himanta claimed that with this appeal he went with all the leaders except Rahul and Sonia
 yadi raajnneeti main rahul nursery ke chaatr hai to amit shah ke paas doctoret kii degree he
 Rahul Gandhi has no place in front of Amit Shah on the scale of the art of meeting people, vision about the country, the pride of working hard for party work

 Ex Bigg Boss Contestant and Bollywood actor Kamal Khan (KRK), famous for critically critiquing films, has targeted famous producer Karan Johar
 keaarke ne aarope lagaaya ki unhone dhadak fame actor ishan khatter ko dharma production se baahar nikaal diya gaya he
 KRK claimed this in a tweet
 rangoli ne bhi ishan or karan johar ke bich khatas ko lekar khulaase kiye hai
 KRK tweeted and wrote, "according to my sources, Karan Johar has fired Ishaan Khattar from Dharma
 kyonki ishan, karan se rudli baat kar rahe the
 Now Karan will not do any film with Ishaan
 "according my sources # karanjoharhas thrown out # Ishaankhattarfrom # Dharmabecause Ishaan was talking rudely with him
 Hence he is not going to make any more film with Ishaan

 While on one hand everyone is surprised by this tweet of KRK, on the other hand Kangana Ranaut's sister Rangoli Chandel found this thing quite normal
 kyonki rangoli kaa maananaa he ki karan johar jaise vyakti ke liye is tarah ke faisle karnaa koi badi baat nahin he
 In his latest tweet, Rangoli also tried to indicate that Karan Johar is pushing Ishaan Khattar to patch up or breakup with some actresses
 lekin ishan ne aisa karne se inkaar kar diya, jiske baad karan johar ne apane dharma production se ishan ko baahar kaa rasta dikhaa diya
 Karan not only takes huge percentage of every artist earnings who he launches or works with and sends to Matrix bt also tells them what to wear and who to sleep with, percentage i understand lot f Hollywood production houses do that but always forcing actors to patch up

 Home Minister Rajnath Singh on Monday while addressing the officers and jawans of the force on the 53rd Raising Day of the Sashastra Seema Bal said that to make the force more strong, the Central Government is seriously considering creating an intelligence wing dedicated to the SSB
 
 rajnath sinhane kaha he ki bhutan or nepal ke saath bharat ke kaaphi lambey samay se dostana sambandh rahe hai or inhen kareebi rishton kii vajah se nepal or bhutan seemaa par tarbandi nahin he lekin rashtravirohi tatv inhen kshetron se zyada ghuspaith kar rahe hai
 Necessary for the intelligence wing to control the border, he said that there is unrestrained movement of India along the border with Nepal and Bhutan and taking advantage of this, anti-national elements are carrying out infiltration and other activities in the Indian border
 aise tatwon par niyantran ke liye ek khufia wing kii sthapana jaruri he
 Considering increasing facilities for women employees, two battalions of SSB have now been deployed for NDRF as it is playing an effective role in social welfare and building friendly relationships
 grih mantri ne kaha ki esasabi kii seemaa par sthit chaukiyon main mahila karmchaariyon ke liye suvidhaon kii kami ko dekhte hue centre sarkaar yahaan suvidhaon ko badhaane par vichaar kii baat bhi is maukey par kiya
 Targeting black money also, SSB soldiers showed many such feats on the occasion of Foundation Day, which was a special thrill among the people present there
 esasabi ke javaanon ne motor cycle ke sho main dairedevil sho dikhaate hue haroonges kaam kiye
 Not only this, the dog wing of SSB taught the lesson of cleanliness campaign of the government
 esasabi ke ek demo main kaale rang ke gubaare dikhaae gaye or usamen ye dikhaaya gaya ki kaale dhan kaa gubbaaraa ab foot chukaa he or ab kaale dhan vaale nahin bachenge
 Let us tell you that this year SSB has seized narcotics worth Rs 274 crore in Seema (nepal and Bhutan) areas and in view of this, it would not be a big deal to call SSB an excellent force
 produsar vidhu vinod choprasanjay dattako lekar munnabhai-3 banaaenge
 Sanjay, who was convicted in the 1993 Mumbai blast case for possession of weapons, is serving a sentence in Yerwada Jail in Pune
 vidhu sanjay dutt ke saath 'munnabhai embibies' or 'lage raho munnabhai' jaisi superhit film bana chuke hai
 There have been reports before about making the third film of Munnabhai series, but no concrete thing was said yet, but this time Vidhu himself has talked about the film
 ek angreji akhbaar ke anusaar munnabhai siries kii teesri film sanjay dutt ke jail se baahar aate hi shuru ho jaaegi
 According to the newspaper, Vidhu said, 'sanjay is very close to me
 vah bahut positive hai

 vah jail main pani se bhari baaltee uthaate hai
 We will start the film as soon as he comes out of jail
 ' Jailed dentists Rajesh and Nupur Talwar will not allow any film or book based on the murder of their daughter Aarushi and those attempting such without their consent will face legal action

 Talwar couple's lawyer Manoj Sisodia said that the couple is upset with media reports on the issue and will not allow any Hollywood and Bollywood film director to make a film in the Aarushi case
 talwaar danpati ko aarushi evam unke gharelu naukar hemraj kii dohari hatya ke aarope main doshi tehraaya gaya evam aaajeevan karawas kii sajaa sunai gai he
 Sisodia said that we have come to know from media reports that some international film directors and writers are willing to make films and some are writing books on Aarushi case
 talwaar danpati ke vakil ne kaha ki rajesh evam noopur is baat se behad khinn hai ki kuch log unki us putree kii hatya par film nirmaan karnaa chaahate hai yaa kitaab likhakar dhan kamanaa chaahate hai, jise ve behad pyaar karte the
 Sisodia said that the couple is still in shock and they are not being tortured after being convicted
 unhone kaha ki yadi talwaar kii anumati ke bina aarushi maamle par koi film banaai gai, to sambhddha nirdeshkon evam lekhakon ke khilaaf kanoonee karrwai kii jaaegi
 According to media reports after the Ghaziabad special CBI court convicted the Talwar couple, some filmmakers and writers are keen on making a film on the matter
 shuukravaar ko hollywood film nideshak clip epa ranyard talwaar dapanti se milane or aarushi par film banane evam ek pustak likhane ke makasad se unki anumati lene ke liye dasna jail pahunche the
 However, he was not allowed by the jail authorities to meet the Talwar couple

 On Tuesday, Anil Kumble resigned as the coach of Team India
 anil kumble ke istife se cricket phens kaaphi dukhi or niraash hai vahiin cricket jaankaron ne bhi ise team india ke liye durbhagyapurna bataaya he
 The tweet of shooter Abhinav Bindra is very much discussed among them all
 abhinav bindra ne twitor par apane coach ke bare main khulaasa kiya ki aakhir kaise vah 20 saal tak us coach se jude rahe jisase vah nafrat karte the
 'my eldest teacher was Coach Resterer
 main unase nafrat karata tha, lekin 20 saal tak unke saath rahaa
 He always told me things i did not want to hear
 bindra ne is apane twit par 'jastseying' hashtag ke saath twit kiya he

 # justsaying‚Äî Abhinav Bindra (@abhinav_bindra)june 20, 2017captain viraat kohli se matbhed ke kaaran anil kumble ke istipha dene ke baad bindra ne twit kiya he
 Abhinav Bindra did not write the name of anyone in this tweet, but reading this tweet, it makes so much sense that his target is directly towards captain Virat Kohli
 vahiin badminton khilaadi jwaala gutta ne abhinav bindra ko riplai karte hue likhaa ki kabhi-kabhi ye training kaa ahm hissaa hota he
 i remember that my head used to do the same

 haalanki kumble ne windies nahin jane kaa faisla karte hue apane pad se istipha de diya
 Anil Kumble has given the reason for this by tweeting
 unhone likhaa he ki bisisiai ne unako bataaya ki team ke captain ko unki kaaryastylee ko lekar pareshaani he

 a surprising case has emerged in Saudi Arabia
 3 logon ne court main kabool kiya he ki unhone chaar saal pehle ek khet main paanch asian majdoor (bhartiya hone kii sambhaavna) ko yatnaaen deen or phir jinda dafan kar diya tha
 Three people in Qatif General Court on Wednesday confessed that they had buried five Asian laborers alive after torturing them for hours, according to 'arab News'
 asian mazdooron ke sade gale shav is maheene kii shuruyaat main saudi arab ke purvi praant ke katif ke safawa ke ek khet main paaya gaya tha
 He died in 2010
 ek sutara ne kaha ki purvi praant kii police ne in hatyaon ke silsile main 25 logon ko giraftaar kiya he
 The news said the suspects included migrants and local citizens
 unhen safawa police thane main hiraasat main rakhaa gaya he
 One person said about the four-year-old incident that he was walking with a friend, consuming alcohol and drugs, when he got a call from another friend around ten o'clock, who immediately asked him to come to the farm
 is vyakti ne court ko bataaya, ‚Äòjab ham khet par pahunche, hamane sharaab pi
 We saw five laborers whose hands were tied to the seat
 jab mere saath vaale dost ne poocha ki unhen kyon baandha gaya he, hamaare mejabaan ne kaha ki inamen se ek ne uske praayojak kii beti or anya mahilaon kaa yon utpeedan kiya
 'he said,' i saw that when we went to other rooms for drinking and intoxicating, five Indian laborers were tied and unconscious
 jab ham sharaab pi rahe the, maine ek ko chillaate hue suna isliye maine baahar jaakar uske thappad maaraa
 'this man confessed that three of them beat the workers drinking alcohol
 iske baad usne kaha ki hamane unhen unke pahchaan patron ke saath hi jinda dafan kar diya
 My friend and i left the farm due to the time of morning prayer while our host was alone

 a new twist is about to come in Bigg Boss house
 sutron ke hawaale se khabar he ki sho main or zyada tadakaa lagane ke liye sangram singh kii garlfriend paayal rohatgi, nishkasit pratibhaagi kushal tandon or armaan kohli kii liv-in garlfriend tanya singh big bos ke lonawala sthit ghar main agle hafte entry le sakate hai
 According to a source, these three are going to come to Bigg Boss house for a special task
 ise fries task naam diya gay he, jiske tahat gharavaalon ko to bina hile-dule murti banakar khadey rahanaa hoga, jabaki teenon mehmaan puure ghar main gum sakenge
 Participants cannot talk to anyone during the freeze task
 unhen naa to pratikriya dene kii ijaajat hogi or naa hi apni bhaawanaaon ko jaahir karnaa hoga
 Let me tell you that before this, the winner of Bigg Boss Season 6, Uvarshi Dholakia, had to go through a similar task last year
 tab unke donon bete big bos ke ghar ke andar aae the
 Both Payal and Kushal will come to the Bigg Boss house for a few hours, while Sangram and Gauhar will have a freeze
 yah bhi kaha ja rahaa he ki channel kii team armaan kii garlfriend se is task ko karne ke liye molbhav kar rahi he
 However, the chance that Kushal has got in Bigg Boss's house is clear that Salman has softened his attitude towards her
 emsidi chunaav main bhale hi bijepi tikaton ke elaan main deree kar rahi ho, lekin party in chunaavon me bhi apane pehle aajamaae hue formule par kaam kar rahi he
 In Delhi, the BJP is repeating the up-maharashtra strategy, in which the first priority will be for the candidate who is guaranteed to win, even if there is no ticket for any party leader in it
 bijepi ne ek din pehle hi aam aadmi party ke emele ko party main shaamil kara kar arvind kejariwal ko jabardast jhatka diya tha
 Ved Prakash, MLA from Bawana, not only resigned from the party and the assembly, but also came to the BJP office and wore the party's dress
 ab bijepi ke adhyaksh manoj tiwari daawa kar rahe he ki veda prakaash kii tarah hi aam aadmi party main kai pareshaan vidhayak hai,jo party ke sampark main he
 BJP National Minister Sardar RP Singh said, 'how Kejriwal treats the mlas, he has told the mlas who have left his party, now they also know who is leaving the party, so the whole party panicked
 happened
 'darasalbijepi upi, maharashtrasamet pichley kai chunaavon main duusari party se netaaon ko todakar virodhiyon ko kamazor karne kii ranneeti apana chuki he, saath hi bijepi kaa formula rahaa he ki jeetne vaala ummidavaar bhale hi duusari party main mili, to use bhi party main shaamil kiya ja saktaa he
 The bjp's strategy in MCD elections also seems to be the same
 shaayad emsidi chunaav ke liye tikat vitaran main ho rahi deree ke peeche bhi yahi vajah he
 Although the BJP leaders are claiming that the BJP is not breaking other parties, rather the leaders of the other party are knocking the door of the BJP, because all are attracted by Modi ji
 party ke pradesh upaadhyaksh rajeev babbar ke mutabik bijepi nae logon ko mauka de rahi he, isiilie party main tikaton par manthan chal rahaa he
 It is evident that the BJP has got enthusiasm from the victory of UP and the party is not behind in taking advantage of the atmosphere created after this, that is why the internal opposition to the decisions of the party is not coming out

 com / fwzx4ymlaz‚Äî ANI (@ani_news)september 2, 2015peter mukherjee indrani ke tisare pati hai
 Aaj Tak disclosed this fact on 29 August itself
 darasal abhi tak peter se is maamle main koi poochtacha nahin hui thi
 Somewhere his influence was also the reason for this
 lekin ab peter poochtacha ke daayre main aa gaye hai
 He was summoned by the police for questioning
 police poochhegi kai sawalpiter mukherjee buudhvaar kii subah kareeb 10:30 baje khaar thane pahunche
 It is being told that the police can ask them ten questions in this case
 jinke jawaab unhen dene honge
 The most important thing in this may be whether Peter really did not yet know that Sheena is Indrani's daughter
 kya vah mikhail ke bare main kuch nahin jaanate the
 Was there any objection to Peter Koshina and Rahul's engagement? ajtak ke sawaal par chuppijab peter mukherjee khaar thane ja rahe the
 So the team till date asked him many questions
 lekin peter ne apni chuppi nahin todi
 It is believed that they will not talk to the media but to the police
 is dauraan indrani ke vakil bhi khaar thane panhuch gaye hai
 The police have made the list police have done full homework to interrogate Peter Mukherjee in the Sheena Murder Case
 jaankaree ke mutabik police ne ek list banaai he
 In which there are some such things apart from questions
 jinaki pushti peter se kii jaani he
 Peter has changed the statement thrice After Indrani was arrested, Peter Mukherjee had earlier said that he was told about the relationship between Sheena and Rahul by his son Rahul himself
 baad main peter ne kaha ki un donon ke sambandh ke bare main khud shina bora ne unhen jaankaree di thi
 According to him, Sheena had told him that Indrani was giving him wrong information
 main unki bahan nahin beti hum
 The story was changed again in the written statement that the police had given to the police at the Khar police station
 sawaal yah he ki agar peter shina ko rahul kii sauteli mausi ke taur par jaanate the, to unhen yah rishta atapata kyon nahin laga? peter se sachai chhipi rahi yaa unhone khud chhipaai? inhi vajahon se peter ab police ke shaq ke daayre main aa gaye hai
 What Peter had said Aaj Tak: After the matter was revealed, former Star India CEO Peter Mukherjee spoke to Aaj Tak on the phone
 unhone kaha tha ki wo is khulaase se hairaan pareshaan hai
 They did not know that Indrani was married
 yaa uske bachche hai
 Peter said that he did not know whether Sheena was Indrani's sister or daughter
 mikhail unka betaa he yaa bhai?mikhail ne jataai thi hairanishina ke bhai mikhail ne saamne aane par goahati main kaha tha ki peter ko indrani or shina ke rishte kii hakeekat maaloom thi
 Perhaps they also know something about the murder
 mikhail ne jo saboot police ko die hai
 Peter is also mentioned somewhere in that
 peter ke saath kaam karne vaale bhi hairaanis puure maamle main hairaan karne vaali baat he ki peter mukherjee 13 varshon main indrani or shina kii hakeekat nahin jaan paae
 While those working with him say that Peter is a very smart and intelligent person
 tabhi vah ek kaamyaab bijness main hai
 It is natural to be surprised that he could not find anything in this matter

 Increased competition among lenders and technological development have now facilitated this
 par du dilligence yani apane asset or dendaree ke sahi moolyankan ke bina karj lene se aap uske bhugtan main diphalt kar sakate hai, karj ke bhavar main funs sakate hai or isse aapaki credit history kharaab ho sakati he
 How to make the right decision about a loan: Good vs
 Bad Debt First of all, confirm why you want to take a loan
 vishafin dot com ke rishi mehara kehete hai, "acha karj aapke bajet par bina kisi dabaav ke aapke vittiya lakshyon ko puraa karne kaa ek tarika hota he
 According to him, "bad debt can be a deal in which a very high interest rate is fixed
 yahaan tak ki agar aap koi mahangi gaadi kharidne ke liye karj lete hai, jisaki vastav main aapako jarurat na ho, to vah ek bura karj ho saktaa he
 "if you buy something for a valid reason, it either helps you to build a property or it can help in increasing your current / future income
" mehara kehete hai, "makaan sareekhe kisi badhati keemat vaale asset kii kharid kisi karj ko acha bana sakati he or is par aapako inakam tex chhot kaa laabh bhi mil saktaa he
 "buying a property gives an opportunity to earn capital gains in the form of rent or capital gains on the value of the property
" ajukeshan lone se aapako bhavishya main zyada kamai karne kaa mauka miltaa he, so ise acha karj mana jaataa he
 One should avoid taking loans on assets whose value is declining
 vaise yah siddhant hameshaa sahi nahin hota
 How much loan should you take? Your loan should be based on your monthly income, expenses and savings
 aapako bhavishya kii dendariyon kaa bhi dhyaan rakhana chahie
 CEO of whatslon
com Timmanna Gowda d
 kehete hai, "koi bhi vyakti aise karj ke liye apni kul aay kaa 20 fisadi tak iemi ke rup main dekar sahajata se jivan bitaa saktaa he
 However, if a loan is being taken to prepare a long-term secured loan or asset, it can be up to 50 per cent of one's net income, provided the short-term loan (less than one year) is fully settled
 Are
 '' niyam ke mutabik aapaki kul iemi shuddh aay ke 50 fisadi ke bheetar hi honi chahie
 Which loan to settle first? Adil Shetty, CEO of bankbazaar
com suggests, "first of all try to settle your unsecured loan as they are more expensive
 masalan bakaayaa credit card bill kaa bhugtan sabase pehle karnaa chahie
 Many personal loans carry a penalty for prepayment
 aapako guna-bhaag karnaa hoga ki karj pehle chukaana kam kharchila he yaa us par byaaj chukaate rahanaa
 "if you have a credit card outstanding and you are only able to pay the minimum amount, then firstly you need to get rid of this cyclical debt, because it attracts an interest rate of up to 40 percent
 iske baad duusare mahange lone nibataayein, jaise personal lone, auto lone, gold ke badale lone, property lone aadi
 If you are not able to repay the loan, then you take another big loan at a lower rate of interest and use it to pay for a small low interest loan
 karj mat len agar
 
 
 You are not able to repay it easily: Default in payment can cause your credit score to deteriorate
 aapako yadi shopping karne kii lat haih aisi chizon kii kharid ke liye credit card yaa aise kisi karj saadhan ke istemaal se bachein jinaki aapako jarurat nahin he
 If the loan is not visible, do not take any loan just because there is an attractive offer in it
 yadi aapaki aay anishchit hoh lone lene se bachein yadi aapako yah bharosa na ho ki aage aapaki kamai kaa silsilaa lagaataar jari rahegaa yaa nahin
 Getting a loan against the retirement fund: Savings for the retirement fund take a long time
 isko kisi tarah ke jokhim main daalane se bachein

 Therefore, Boeing had only one option to manufacture its aircraft by extracting this metal from the existing titanium mine in Andhra Pradesh, India and fulfill its order in time to establish its reign in the aviation world

 Boeing contacted global consulting firm mckinsey & Company in search of titanium, the New York Times reported

 Boeing engaged mckinsey & Company to explore titanium mining in India and estimated that through this project, it would spend about $ 500 million (rs 3,500 crore) annually to extract titanium from the mine
 gauratlab he ki bowing kii is deal main bharat main khadaan lene ke project main uske saath ukraine kii company bhi shaamil thi jise is project kii financing kerani thi
 According to the New York Times, in 2019, according to the New York Times, the draft of the Ukraine company, it was said that the high officials of the government in India will be obtained mining license through bribe
 company kii taraf se pesh kiye gaye ek power point pregentation main 8 ahm bhartiya adhikariyon kaa naam diya gaya jinhen rishwat dekar is deal ko safal karne kii baat kahi gai
 Notably, the consulting firm mckinsey & Company did not object to this strategy of the Ukraine company
 jab bowing vimaan ke drimliner project ko puraa karne ke liye titanium dhaatu kii jarurat padi to america company ne ukraine kii us companni ko chunaa jisane rus or purv soviet ganraajyon se ukraine ke liye gas deal main ahm bhoomika adaa kii thi
 The company was led by the influential businessman of Ukraine, Dmitry Firtash
 lekin bowing or ukraine kii company kii bharat main titanium khadaan lene kii yojana vifal ho gai jiske baad america court main bowing ne phirtash ke khilaaf isliye mukadmaa kar diya kyonki vifal deal main bhi phirtash ne bhartiya adhikariyon ko lagbhag 130 karod bataur rishwat dene kaa bill bowing ko thama diya tha
 According to a New York Times report, Dimitri Firtash's statement in the US court that he had bribed Indian officials to the tune of Rs 130 crore could not be pursued
 kyonki bharat sarkaar ne america or ukraine kii companiyon ke bich uthe is vivaad main dakhal nahin diya or na hi ukraine ke kaarobaari ke daavon kii jaanch kii gai
