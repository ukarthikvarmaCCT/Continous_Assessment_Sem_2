 There is a book by journalist Alok Mehta, who is named after Rao
 1993 main likhi is kitaab main alok mehta ne narsinha raav ke baad sambhavtit pradhanmantriyon ke bare main likhaa he
 For 21 years, this book has been retained due to this one incident which i want to tell you
 jaisaa likhaa he vaisaa hi pard rahaa hum
 In the first election of 1952, at a crowded gathering in Rewa, Madhya Pradesh, Jawaharlal Nehru called against his own Congress party candidate Shiv Bahadur Singh that he had become a party candidate by deceit and did not vote for him
 tatkaaleen vindhyapradesh ke mukhyamantri avadhesh pratap singh ke bete govind narayan singh aaj bhi us din ko yaad karte hue kehete hai ki manch par hi pandit nehru ke kaan main kisi vyakti ne shiv bahadur singh par dhokhadhadi or rishwatakhori ke kaaran 1951 main nyaayalay se sunai gai teen varsh kii sazaa kaa ullekh kar diya tha
 The matter was sub judice in the High Court but Nehru boiled over hearing all this and immediately confessed his mistake and got the party candidate defeated
 main apni taraf se is tathy kii pushti nahin kar saktaa lekin bhartiya raajnneeti kaa shaayad yah akelaa udhaaharan hoga ki tikat milane ke baad uske prachaar ke liye aayaa rashtriya netaa manch par jaakar kah de ki hamase galati hui he, aap hamaare ummidavaar ko vot mat dijiega
 i have not given this example to make Nehru a deity but to remind him who considers himself a god these days in politics
 shivbahadur singh ke bete arjuna singh baad main madhya pradesh kii congress kii raajnneeti ke dhuree banate hai lekin yah ek alag or lambii kahani he
 Now let me show you this picture, the other person of short stature in this picture is Anand Rai who is revealing things at his level in Vyapam case
 anand raay kii naujavaani kaa acha khaasaa hissaa rashtriya swayamsevak ke sadsy ke rup main guzara he
 Indore has also been the president of the bjp's medical cell
 lekin aaj yah swayamsevak apni suraksha ko lekar daraa hua he or jis sanghathan kii shakha se raashtra pratham ke mantra ko siikhaa uske pramukh zed plus kii suraksha main
 There is no harm in taking z Plus but have you heard the big leaders of the RSS saying that we are proud of a volunteer like Anand who did not even care about his life ahead of the principle of Nation First
 bijepi ke netaaon ne anand raay ko congress kaa agent bataaya he
 Hopefully, like the rest of the media, Anand Rai will also appear on the cover of RSS mouthpiece Panchjanya and Organizer
 anand ke saath duusare wheasal blor bhi apni suraksha ko lekar aashwast nahin hai
 Even after so much uproar, the government has not removed their concern
 madhya pradesh ke rajyapal ramanaresh yadav kaa kya hoga
 He was made the accused number ten in the Vyapam scam but the Madhya Pradesh High Court quashed the FIR lodged against him saying that he could not be questioned while in the post as he had constitutional shield
 supreme court ne is maamle main rajyapal or centre ko notice jari kar chaar hafton main jawaab maanga he
 The Prime Minister is out of the country, so the issue has arisen whether to wait for a decision about the Governor till his arrival or take any immediate action
 kendriya grahamantri rajnath singh ne raashtrapati pranab mukherjee se mulaakaat bhi kii he
 The Congress has been asking why the BJP is not removing the governor
 congress ab kah rahi he ki rajyapal ko khud hi istipha de dena chahie
 The Modi government had removed many governors formed during the UPA era
 kuch par bhrashtachar ke aarope bhi bataaye gaye the lekin ramanaresh yadav ko nehru kii 125veen jayanti ke liye bani samiti kaa sadsy bhi banaaya he
 At that time, the BJP felt that the pressure of resignation on Shivraj Singh could also increase if Ramnaresh Yadav was removed
 rajyapal ne iftaar kaa aayojan kiya tha jisamen mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan bhi aamantrit the magar nahin gaye
 The Congress is demanding the resignation of the Chief Minister, in response to which the Union Home Minister of Madhya Pradesh Babu Lal Gaur has said that during the time of Arjun Singh, five thousand people were killed in the Bhopal gas case, did he resign
 supreme court ne vyaapman or isse judi sandigdh maut kii jaanch sibiai ko saunp di he
 In two weeks, the CBI has been asked whether the court should monitor the case or the CBI
 is bich madhya pradesh main privet medical collejon se judi ek or pariksha dimet ko lekar vivaad ho rahaa he
 There are allegations that the children of senior officers and judges have been given medical seats with money
 12 july ko dimet ke imtahaan hone vaale hai
 But an audio recorded on June 23 has surfaced in which negotiations of up to Rs 40 lakhs are being negotiated for Demat
 ye tepe jabalpur hoicourt ko bheja ja chukaa he
 The court felt that the brokers could still be active, so many strict instructions were given
 adaalat ne kaha he ki rajya main un sabhi 9 jagahon par hai rizolution ke scinar lagaaye jaaen jahaan imtahaan honge
 It will be difficult to carry any electronic device from these scanners
 oemar shit kii scan kii hui copy sef castady main rakhi jaaegi
 The comments is bich guuruuvaar ko madhya pradesh vyavsaayik pariksha mandal ne rajya ke sabhi akhbaaron main khaas vigyaapan diya he
 Vyapam has launched its app
 is vigyaapan main likhaa he ki vyaapman ke ap kaa shubharambh mananeey mantri shri umashankar gupta ji ke dwaara 9 july 2015 ko sampann hoga
 If the advertisement is in the morning, it must have been done
 hamane bhi google ke play store main jaakar vyaapman ap downlod kar liya
 When clicked on the app, many more information was found inside
 jaise aplicoshan states jahaan aap apane aplicoshan ke bare main jaankaree le sakate hai
 Then there is also information about search application, test admit card etc
, exam schedule
 isapar clic kiya to pataa chalaa ki saal 2007 se is saal 2015 tak pravesh parikshaon or naukariyon main bhartiyon kii jaankaree bhi he jinhen lekar vivaad ho rahaa he
 i often say that neither governance or app are neither tools of transparency nor examples, but how interesting is Vyapam's app, especially on the same day that the Supreme Court handed over the investigation to its scams
 1952 ke pehle chunaav main madhya pradesh ke reva kii bheed bhari sabha main jawahar laal nehru ne apni hi congress party ke ummidavaar shivbahadur singh ke viruddh aahvaan kiya tha ki yah dhokhe se party ke ummidavaar ban gaye hai or inhen vot mat dijie
 Govind Narayan Singh, son of the then Vindhya Pradesh Chief Minister Awadhesh Pratap Singh, still remembers the day, saying that someone in the ears of Pandit Nehru on stage was heard from the court in 1951 due to fraud and bribery on Shiv Bahadur Singh
 Sentence of the year was mentioned
 maamla oonchi adaalat main vichaaradhin tha lekin nehru ji yah sab sunate hi ubal pade or unhone tatkaal apni galati sweekaarte hue party pratyaashee ko harva diya
 i cannot confirm this fact from my side but perhaps this will be the only example of Indian politics that after getting the ticket, the national leader who came to promote it should go to the forum and say that we have made a mistake, you will not vote for our candidate
 
 yah udhaaharan maine nehru ko devtaa banane ke liye nahin diya he balki unhen yaad dilaane ke liye diya he jo raajnneeti main in dinon khud ko devtaa samajhate hai
 Shiv Bahadur Singh's son Arjun Singh later becomes the pivot of Madhya Pradesh Congress politics but it is a different and longer story
 ab main aapako yah tasviir dikhaata hum, is tasviir main jo chote kad ke duusare shaks hai wo anand raay hai jo vyapam maamle main apane str par chizon ko ujagar kar rahe hai
 a considerable part of Anand Rai's youth has passed as a member of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak
 indore bhaajapa ke medical cell ke bhi adhyaksh rahe hai
 But today this swayamsevak is scared about his safety and in the protection of z Plus, the head of the organization from whose branch he learned the mantra of Nation First
 zed plus lene main koi buraai nahin he lekin kya aapane aresas ke bade netaaon ko yah kehete suna he ki hamen anand jaise swayamsevak par garv he jisane raashtra pratham ke siddhant ke aage jaan kii bhi parvaah nahin kii
 BJP leaders have described Anand Rai as an agent of the Congress
 ummid he jo media ke baaki hisson kii tarah anand raay aresas ke mukhpatr panchajnya or orgeniser ke cover par bhi nazar aaenge
 Along with Anand, the other whistle blowers are also not confident about their safety
 itane hangaame ke baad bhi sarkaar ne unki chintaa dur nahin kii he
 What will happen to the Governor of Madhya Pradesh, Ram Naresh Yadav
 ve vyaapman ghotaale main aaropee number das banaae gaye the lekin madhya pradesh hoicourt ne yah kah kar unke khilaaf darj exiaar radd kar di ki pad par rahete hue unase poochtacha nahin kii ja sakati kyonki unhen sanvaidhanik kavach praapt he
 The Supreme Court has issued notices to the Governor and the Center in this matter seeking an answer in four weeks
 pradhanmantri desh se baahar hai isliye yah masalaa uth khadaa hua he ki unke aane tak rajyapal ke bare main nirnay kaa intazaar kiya jaae yaa turant koi kadam uthaaya jaae
 Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh has also met President Pranab Mukherjee
 congress kahati rahi he ki bijepi rajyapal ko kyon nahin hataa rahi he
 The Congress is now saying that the governor should resign himself
 modi sarkaar ne upie ke daur main bane kai rajyapalon ko hataa diya tha
 Some were also accused of corruption, but made Ramnaresh Yadav a member of the committee made for Nehru's 125th birth anniversary
 tab bijepi ko lagata tha ki ramanaresh yadav ko hataaya gaya to shivaraj singh par bhi istife kaa dabaav bad saktaa he
 Iftar was organized by the Governor in which Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan was also invited but did not go
 congress mukhyamantri kaa istipha maang rahi he jiske jawaab main madhya pradesh ke grahamantri babu laal gaur ne kaha he ki arjuna singh ke samay bhopal gas cond main paanch hazaar log mare the tab kya unhone istipha de diya tha
 The Supreme Court has handed over the investigation of Vyapam and the suspicious death related to it to the CBI
 sibiai se do hafte main poocha he ki bataaye ki maamle kii nigaraanee court kare yaa sibiai hi

 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and Prime Minister Narendra Modi are speaking in one voice about one country one election
 puure desh main loksabhaa or sabhi vidhansabhaon ke chunaav ek saath karaane kii charchaa ne ek baar phir tab jor pakadaa tha, jab raashtrapati ramnath kovind ne bajet satr ke dauraan apane abhibhaashan main iskaa pramukhataa se zikr kiya or kaha ki lagaataar chunaav hote rahane se vikaas ke kaamon main baadha padati he
 Nitish Kumar was in Delhi on Wednesday and when asked about this, he told Tapak that he had been a supporter of this thing from the beginning
 nitish ne kaha ki har saal bharat main kahin naa kahin chunaav hote rahete hai or puraa maahaul usee main duba rahata he
 He said that if elections are held simultaneously everywhere, the expenses will also be saved and governments will also get more time to work peacefully
 nitish ne kaha ki vah iskaa purajor samarthan karte hai, lekin iske liye sabhi dalon or sabhi rajyon ke saath sahmati banani hogi
 What is the reason for the support? Experts believe that Nitish Kumar is saying this because of political compulsion
 biharmen vidhansabha ke chunaav 2020 main hone hai
 Earlier, the challenges for Nitish Kumar are increasing
 lalu yadav se sambandh todakar nitish bijepi ke saath aa to gaye, lekin ab yahaan unhen aage kii raah aasaan nahin dikh rahi he
 You can guess Nitish Kumar's uneasiness that this is Nitish Kumar's second visit to Delhi within a week
 nitish 27 janvari ko bhi dilli main the
 At first Nitish Kumar was rarely seen in Delhi
 sutron ke anusaar nitish bihar main vikaas kii yojanaon ke bare main centre ke mantriyon se baatcheet karne ke liye aate hai
 According to experts, Nitish Kumar wants to have an electoral dialogue with the BJP from now and is constantly trying for it
 hone hai chunaavabihar main agle kuch maheene ke bheetar ek loksabhaa seat or do vidhansabha siton par up chunaav hone hai
 The Lok Sabha seat of Araria is vacated by the death of RJD MP Taslimuddin
 vidhansabha kii jin do siton par upachunaav hone hai, wo hai bhabhua or jahanabad
 Bhabhua's seat was earlier with BJP, while the seat of Jehanabad was with RJD
 jin 3 siton par chunaav hona he, unamem se koi bhi seat jediu ke paas nahin thi
 Nitish Kumar was part of the grand alliance with Lalu and the Congress when the election was first held
 jaahir he BJP in teenon upachunaav main jediu ko koi seat nahin dena chaahegi, kyonki uske paas inamen se koi seat nahin thi
 On the other hand, if Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar does not get any seat in the by-election after joining BJP, then it will be a big push for his party and for his image himself
 isse yah sandesh jayega ki bijepi ke saath aane ke baad nitish kumaar kii chal nahin rahi he
 Rajya Sabha seats will also be vacant: Within the next few months, 6 Rajya Sabha seats of Bihar will also be vacant on which elections are to be held
 bihar main partiyon kii sthiti aisi he ki 5 siten to lagbhag tay he, lekin chhathi seat ko lekar jod-tod ho sakati he
 Both Nitish Kumar and BJP would like that the sixth seat also came to them
 nitish kumaar kii chintaa yaheen khatm nahin hoti
 Lok Sabha elections are due in 2019 and out of 40 Lok Sabha seats in Bihar, BJP alliance has 31 seats
 gathbandhan main aamtaur par aisa mana jaataa he ki koi bhi party apni 'seating' yani maujuuda seat nahin chhodti
 Will Nitish Kumar's JDU have to be content with just 9 seats in the Lok Sabha elections? If this happens, Nitish Kumar's height will definitely be small
 nitish kumaar jarur yah soch rahe honge ki agar 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi apana dam dikhaa kar zyada siten hasil kar leti he or centre main phir se sarkaar bana leti he to phir 2020 ke bihar vidhansabha chunaav main unke paas tol-mol karne kii takat bhi nahin rah jaaegi
 After the Lok Sabha elections, if the BJP again forms the government at the Center, then Nitish Kumar will have no choice but to agree to the BJP at the time of Bihar assembly elections, because there is no room left for him in the Lalu camp on Congress
 
 nitish kumaar is baat ko acchhee tarah samajhate hai or dekh chuke hai ki maharashtra main bijepi ke sabase puraane gathbandhan ke saathi shivasena kaa kya hashr hua
 Nitish Kumar wants to sit down with the BJP in time and discuss all these issues from now on and get a consensus on the seats
 sutron ke mutabik nitish kumaar kii bechaini ke baavjood bijepi ke bade netaa is baat ke liye nitish kumaar ke saath baatcheet karne se batch rahe hai
 In view of the circumstances and political compulsions, Nitish Kumar would definitely like that the assembly elections in Bihar also be held along with the 2019 Lok Sabha elections so that it is easy to negotiate seats with the rest of the BJP
 buudhvaar ko nitish kumaar se jab yah poocha gaya ki kya unhen lagata he ki bihar ke vidhansabha chunaav bhi loksabhaa chunaav ke saath ho sakate hai to unhone kaha ki iske liye ab bahut kam samay bachaa he or itani jaldi aisa ho paanaa sambhav nahin hoga
 If Nitish Kumar is supporting Modi's idea of holding elections all over the country, then he has his own reasons for this
 nitish ko dar he ki unke upar bihar main bijepi ke junior partner hone kaa khatra mandaraane lagegaa

 Before this very important match on Sunday, let's take a look at the history of World Cup matches between India and South Africa and some important events related to it - March 15, 1992, Adelaide, Australia was a lot new in this World Cup
 rangeen jersey, safed gend, kaali site screen, flud lits, nayaa round robin formet, barsaat ke liye nae niyam or dakshin africa
 South Africa was playing such a big tournament for the first time after nearly two decades of exile from international cricket
 nelson mandela or unki party african neshnal conference kii koshishon kii badaulat unhen aakhri maukey par is worldcup main shaamil kiya gaya tha, isliye toornament kaa shedul bhi badla gaya
 Instead of 29, 36 matches were to be played in the tournament
 worldcup main unke khilne ke liye isisi ne ek shart bhi rakhi
 As a condition, a referendum will be held in South Africa, in which only white South Africans will vote
 unase poocha jayega ki kya wo rangabhed ke khatme ko sahi maanate hai
 Mandela's party assured the ICC that South Africans would answer yes to this question
 khayr, ye janamat worldcup shuru hone se pehle nahin ho paaya
 India had already been on the verge of dropping out of the tournament before this match, but South Africa needed a win over India to reach the semi-finals
 dakshin africa captain capler vesals ne toss jeeta or bharat ko ballebaaji karne ke liye kaha
 Big names in the Indian batting line-up were Srikanth, Manjrekar, Azharuddin, Kapil Dev and two emerging young batsmen Sachin Tendulkar and Vinod Kambli
 barsaat kii vajah se match 30 over kaa ho gaya tha
 When Srikanth became a victim of Donald's account without opening the account, Azhar (79) and Manjrekar (28) started the batting
 lekin team ke 100 ran hone se pehle hi manjrekar or 100 ran hone ke turant baad tendulkar (14) ke out hote hi bade score kii ummiden dhoomil hone lageen
 Had Kapil Dev not scored 42 off 33 balls at the last moment, the situation would have been worse
 khayr bharat ne kisi tarah 30 over main 180 ran kaa sammanjanak score banaaya or apane gendbaajon ko ek ladane laayak score diya
 The innings started for South Africa by Andrew Hudson (53) and Peter Kastern (84), adding 128 runs for the first wicket to lay the foundation for his team's victory
 lekin match ne ek baar phir karavat badali or dakshin africa ne agle 35 ranon ke andar apane 4 wicket ganvaa die
 India had a chance to save the match, but only 27 runs were left
 jise captain vesals or hansee chronie ne aakhri over kii pehali gend par manzil tak pahunchaa diya
 The hero of this match was Peter Kastern, who was not even selected in the 30 World Cup probables
 baad main captain vesals or coach mike procter kii koshishon ke baad unhen team main jagah mili thi
 The victory in this match led South Africa to the semi-finals but the players still did not know whether they would play the semi-finals or not, as the result of the survey conducted by the ICC in South Africa came two days after the match
 khilaadiyon ko laga ki agar vot rangabhed ke haq main padaa to unhen waapas lautnaa padegaa
 But 2
 8 million logon ke bich kiye gaye is survey main 68
 The abolition of apartheid of 73 per cent was considered correct and South Africa played the World Cup semi-finals
 15 may 1999, hov, englandworldcup ke saatven adishan main donon tiimon kaa ye pehla-pehla match tha
 The toss fell in favor of India and captain Azharuddin decided to bat first
 saurav ganguli, sachin tendulkar or rahul dravid jis ballebaaji kram ke pehle teen ballebaaj hon us team se ummiden badhanaa laazmi tha
 sachin-saurav did not disappoint either
 pehle wicket ke liye donon ne 16wein over tak 67 ran jod bhi liye the, lekin lans klusener kii ek gend ne 28 ran bana chuke sachin ko waapas pavilion bhej diya
 After this, Dravid and Ganguly made a slow but solid partnership of 130 runs for the second wicket, taking the team's score to 197 by the 42nd over
 dravid 54 ran banaakar out hue to ganguli kii lay bhi bighad gai
 Lack of coordination with Azhar did not allow Sourav to complete the century and he was run out after scoring a score of 97
 iske baad ranon par jaise lagaam si lag gai
 Azhar (24) and Jadeja (16) tried to show hands but did not succeed
 team india 50 over main 5 wicket par sirf 253 ran hi bana pai
 The score was not very big in front of South Africa, but in England conditions it was not so easy to bat in front of bowlers like Srinath, Prasad and Kumble
 or iskaa andaja africa ko pari kii shuruyaat main hi ho gaya
 Srinath showed the path to the pavilion without giving both openers a chance to freeze
 22 ran par do wicket ganvaane ke baad dakshin africa ne sanbhalkar khelnaa shuru kiya
 Jack Kallis and Mark Boucher, who were promoted by promotion in the batting order, started to play resiliently, but Boucher was bowled by Kumble for 34 runs
 iske baad aae darryl kalinan ne ran to sirf 19 hi banaae lekin kallis ke saath milakar team kaa score 100 ke paar pahunchaa gaye
 After this, captain Hansie Cronje (27) and Jonty Rhodes (39 not out) played small but important partnerships with Kallis to bring his team to victory
 haalanki manzil ke kareeb pahunchakar kallis ladkadaa gaye or shatak se sirf 4 ran pehle ran out ho gaye
 India were defeated by 4 wickets in this match and South Africa got the second win in the World Cup against India
 12 march 2011, nagpur, bharatpane maidaanon par bharat kaa muqabla karnaa aasaan nahin he or isliye worldcup ke is adishan main bharat ne fevorett ke taur par shuruyaat kii thi
 India reached Nagpur after registering a big win over Bangladesh, a match tie with England, easy wins over Ireland and the Netherlands
 yahaan uskaa muqabla dakshin africa kii aisi team se tha, jiske khilaaf use worldcup main abhi bhi khaataa kholana baaki tha
 She reached Nagpur after defeating South Africa, West Indies and Netherlands and losing to England
 visie stadium main toss dhoni ne jeeta or pehle ballebaaji kaa faisla kiya, jise sahvaag or sachin ne ekadam sahi sabit kiya
 Together, they added 142 runs for just 18 overs
 66 gendon par dhuandhar 73 ran banaakar sahvaag out hue to unki jagah gambhir ne le lee
 Gambhir, along with Sachin, took Team India's score to 200 and then to 250
 is dauraan sachin ne apane van-de kariyar kii 48veen centuri puri kar lee
 On the other hand, Gambhir also scored a half-century
 41wein over main 267 ran par ye jodi tuuti to dakshin africa ko match main vaapasi kii ummid bandhi
 Sachin was dismissed by 111 runs and after a run, Gambhir (69) also returned to the pavilion for a total score of 268
 iske baad to jaise team india main 'tu chal main aayaa' kii pratiyogita shuru ho gai or dekhte hi dekhte team india ne apane 8 ballebaaj sirf 29 ran ke dauraan ganvaa die
 At one time, Team India, looking towards the big score, could not play even 50 overs and 48
 4 over main mahaj 296 ran par simat gai
 Dale Steyn was the South African bowling hero who took 5 wickets for 50 runs
 jawaab main dakshin africa ne bhi sanbhalkar shuruyaat kii lekin captain grem smith 16 ran se aage nahin bad paae
 Now Jack Kallis was at the crease with Hashim Amla and the two started building a solid partnership together
 donon ne milakar 86 ran jode
 When Amla was dismissed by 61 runs, AB de Villiers and Kallis (69) took the responsibility
 divilliars (52) ne to tabadatod ballebaaji kii
 The bowlers of Team India took wickets at regular intervals but small partnerships of South Africa proved to be very big
 jepi dumini or yohan botha ne 23-23 ran banaae to faif du placi 25 ran banaakar naabad rahe
 South Africa won the match by 3 wickets with 2 balls left
 del sten is mukaable ke 'main of da match' rahe

 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he) Former India cricket captain Kapil Dev, who won the 1983 World Cup, believes that the strong side of the Indian team will be his batting in the upcoming World Cup, but if India has to win the title this time in 28 years after this cricketing league, then at the time of toss Mahendra Singh Dhoni will also need luck
 kapil ne saakshaatkaar main kaha, ballebaaji hamaari majbootee he or meraa maananaa he ki hamen is par nirbhar hokar vishwaas rakhana chahie
 Sometimes luck also plays an important role
 har match main toss jeetna kaaphi mahatvapurn he
 If we lose the toss and the opposition team gives us a huge target of 300 or more runs then it will be very difficult
 unhone kaha, agar ham pehle ballebaaji karte hai or 300 yaa isse adhik ran banaate hai to hamaare gendbaaj har match jeetne ke liye bachaa hua kaam puraa kar sakate hai
 Most people have expressed concern over the lack of an all-rounder with the World Cup Indian team being balanced but Kapil said that Dhoni will fill that space properly as a wicketkeeper batsman
 unhone kaha, aisi koi baat nahin he kyonki wicketiper ko bhi olerounder mana jaataa he
 We have Dhoni as an all-rounder in the team
 aashaa he ki vah itihaas rachane or bharat ko vishwa cap dilaane main madad karne ke liye acha pradarshan karenge vaise aankade is baat ke gavaah hai ki kisi mejabaan ne ab tak vishwa cap nahin jeeta he
 On Friday morning, the cabinet approved the ordinance to defer the NEET for a year
 rajya sarkarein is mudde ko lekar ekamat hai lekin vahiin dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal iskaa virodh karte nazar aa rahe hai
 Even before this decision of the cabinet, Kejriwal wrote a letter to PM Modi opposing the ordinance being brought by the Central Government on NEET and said that if the central government brings this ordinance, then the message will be sent to the general public that the government will save money Is supporting kejariwal ne apni chitthee main likhaa ki 'NEET par supreme court kaa faisla saraahneey he or deshbhar ke mata-pitaaon ne iskaa swaagat kiya he

 While praising Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan even ahead of Gujarat, Uma Bharti said that the world has been amazed by the development that has taken place in the state in the last years and in many cases, Madhya Pradesh is ahead of Gujarat
 unhone kaha ki aaj desh main ek kamjor sarkaar or kamjor pradhanmantri hai
 He said that it is the effort of the Congress that if the UPA is not able to come to power after the upcoming Lok Sabha elections, the NDA also cannot come to power
 unhone kaha ki yah desh madhumakhi kaa chhatta nahin he balki yah hinduon ke 33 karod devi devataaon kaa desh he
 On this occasion, Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan thanked the national president of the party Rajnath Singh for giving maximum representation to Madhya Pradesh in his working committee

 18 march kokarnatakaki congress sarkaar ne samiti kii report ke aadhaar par centre ko lingayat samaaj ko alpsankhyak dharm kaa darja dene kii sifarish kii he
 This is seen as a move to garner Lingayat votes in the upcoming assembly elections
 lingayaton kii sankhya par raajnneeti ke jaankaar ekamat nahin he
 According to the ethnic census conducted 87 years ago, they constitute 17 percent, but India was not free and neither states were reorganized
 2013 main mukhyamantri siddharamaiya ne kathith saamaajik aarthik surveykshan karaayaa tha, jisamen rajya main ligayaton kii sankhya maatr 9
 8 percent was stated
 yah shiv ke upaask hai
 Lingayat was founded by 12th century social reformer and philosopher Basavanna
 haalanki yah bahes kaa vishay he ki unhone is samaaj kii neenv rakhi yaa keval unke maargdarshan main yah ek jan andolan bana
 Brahmin Hindu values had a strong influence during the reign of King Bijal 2 in Karnataka
 usee dauraan lingayat samaaj kaa udgam hua jo jati vyavastha or vedon ko nahin maanate
 It is believed to have originated from the many devotional movements that took place in South India in the 8th century
 yah andolan vartmaan brahmanic hindu vyavastha kaa aalochak tha jabaki lingayat ne isaki jadon ko chunauti di
 Lingayats have been demanding recognition of a religion different from Hinduism
 unki apni alag pahchaan ko paribhaashit karnaa mushkil banaata he unamem or virshaiv main samanta
 It is believed that Lingayat and Veerashaiva are one, but historical evidence refutes this fact
 virshaiv bhi ek shaiva samaaj he jo hindu dharm kaa hissaa he
 It began in the 16th century and its followers believe that Basavanna was not the founder of the Lingayat society but was a social reformer who was part of Veerashaiva
 haalanki tathyon ke anusaar lingayat or virshaiv main paryaapt asamanthaayen hai
 While Veerashaiva believed in the Vedas and caste system, the Lingayats only challenged the Vedas and caste system from the beginning, former Chief Ministers of the state BS Yedurappa, late journalists Gauri Lankesh and MM Kulbargi are believed to be in Lingayat, Lingayat community political There is a large vote bank for the parties
 pichley kuch dashakon se lingayat samaaj bhaajapa kaa saath dete aayaa he
 In 2008, BJP fielded 71 Lingayat candidates in the assembly elections
 kyonki bhaajapa ke siem ummidavaar yediurppa lingayat samaaj se hi the, yahi kaaran rahaa ki lingayat ummidavaar rajya main bade antar se jite or rajya main bhaajapa kii sarkaar bani
 In 2013, when Yeddyurappa split from the BJP and contested with his own party, the party lost 20 seats in Lingayat-dominated seats
 congress ne in lingayat prabhaav vaali 56 siton main se 34 siten jeetin
 It was 20 seats more than in 2008 which played a significant role in his victory
 2011 kii janaganana main kuch lingayat saamaajik sansthaaon ne apane ko hindu dharm main darj na karne ke liye prachaar kiya tha
 Lingayat society has been demanding this for a long time
 karnataka ke mukhyamantri siddharamayya ne 2017 kaha ki agar lingayat samaaj main ise lekar koi asamanjas na ho to ve centre sarkaar ko iske liye prastaav bhejne ko taiyaar hai
 Yeddyurappa retorted, calling it an attempt to divide the society
 unhone kaha ki lingayat or virshaiv ek hi hai or lingayat hindu dharm kaa hi hissaa hai
 Rahul Gandhi also visited the monastery of Lingayat Samaj during his tour of Karnataka
 pradhanmantri ne bhi aane vaale vidhansabha chunaav ko dekhte hue sansad ke bajet satr ke apane bhaashan main basaavanna ko loktantr kaa asli vaastukar kaha
 Just before the assembly elections, a 7-member panel of the Karnataka government submitted its report to the Karnataka Minorities Commission suggesting that Lingayats be given minority status
 yah baat dhyaan dene vaali he ki janvari main samiti ne sarkaar ke 4 saptaah kaa samay dene par 6 maheene kaa samay maanga tha
 The members of the committee said that this is an important subject and the committee has the responsibility to work on it in a lawful and scientific manner
 samiti ne samay se pehle apni report saunp di, jise nishchit rup se siyaasi phaayde ke liye istemaal kiya jayega, chunki rajya main chunaav kii ghoshnaa agle maheene ho sakati he, lihaaja lingayaton kii maang puri karke siyaasi fasal kaati ja sakati he

 bahut se logon kaa maananaa he ki yah tippanee congress ko gujarat chunaavon main bahut baari padi thi
 In 2014, when Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar used the word 'chaiwala' to attack Modi, Modi made him his weapon
 modi ne 'chaay pe charchaa' campan shuru kar diya tha
 Then he also extended a father-daughter selfie campaign

 Regarding the campaign this time, PMO officials say that pictures and messages are coming from all over the world

 On 31 March, the Prime Minister is scheduled to address Chowkidars across the country and around 400,000 people have registered for the event
 abhiyaan kaa sanchaalan kar rahi team ko ummid he ki sambodhan ke din tak yah sankhya badhkar das lakh tak ho jaaegi

 However, there is a big difference between 2014 and now
 paanch saal pehle, modi upie-2 ke kushasan ke khilaaf vipakshi ke rup main chunauti kii aguai kar rahe the
 This time, from unemployment to rural crisis, the Prime Minister is accountable to all problems and the entire opposition including Congress is using these issues to target
 brand salaahkaar harish bijur kehete hai, ''namo ek vaada tha
 And that promise was redeemable
 paanch saal biit chuke hai or pradhanmantri tathaa unke mantrimandal ne kai kaam kiye hai
 There are two types of opinions - one they worked and second, they did not work
 "bhaajapa kaa chaukeedaar abhiyaan janata kaa dhyaan samasyaon se dur karke brand modi kii taraf kheenchna chahta he
 The truth is that there is no one to confront him in this matter and the most important thing is that whatever he is targeted against, Modi makes him his weapon
 brand salaahkaar santosh desai kehete hai, ''56 inch se lekar balakot hawaii hamale or notebandi tak, vah yah sandesh dene main safal rahe hai ki itane saahsee faisle lene kii himmat bas unheen main he
 All this helps to make him an image of a fearless and unmatched leader
 " brand ranneetikaron kaa kahana he ki ek or baat he jo modi ko takat detii he, vah he unka bharosemand samarthak varg jo unhen kamajori ko takat main badalane main sakasham bana detaa he
 Desai says, "me too
"

 It is not a well-crafted slogan, rather it shows the sense of oath and the power of oath

 "brand consultant Harish Bijoor calls this campaign multi-layered
 bhaajapa ke dhur samarthakon se lekar puraa mantrimandal ab chaukidaaron se bharaa he
 So can every watchman be a thief? The second layer is that "watchman participation"
 vah shaks gaiyr-raajnneetik, aarthik, dharmik ho saktaa / sakati he
 Even the watchman fighting against terrorism

 "the strategists of this BJP campaign have done so in their series of seven short films served on social media
 ek se teen minute kii avadhi vaali har film sakaaratmak visheshtaon kii ore dhyaan aakarshith karti he
 The initial four films establish Modi's Narrative and through him try to neutralize Rahul's 'chowkidar Chor Hai' campaign, creating pride for Modi among the common man
 saath hi svachh bharat or kaledhan par ankush lagane jaise vishyon ke jariye desh kii vyavastha kii safai ke liye pradhanmantri ke prayaason par dhyaan kendrit kiya gaya he
 Modi hopes that it will work for him as Mani Shankar Aiyar's 'chaiwala' comment did in 2014
 tab unhone shchaay pe charchaay ke jariye chunaav kaa rukh badal diya tha
 This time, the three-minute main film has a song with the punchline, "I am the watchman"
 " film modi kii ''main desh kaa chaukeedaar hum" tippanee ke stock footage ke saath shuru hoti he
 In one film, the manager of a car showroom completely denies the bribe offered for cash purchases, saying, "I am a true watchman of the country
" " film sandesh detii he ki tex kii chori na hone den
 In another film, a wife prevents her husband from spreading garbage in a public place (swachh Bharat); The third shows a doctor son who works at night and tells the mother that he is a watchman guarding social health
 ''kya desh kaa chaukeedaar (modi ke liye prayukt) der raat tak akele kaam karenge, main bhi unke saath hum
 "BJP workers say the campaign has boosted the confidence of party workers and insists that it has failed Rahul's slogan" Chowkidar Chor Hai "

 Pal has been monitoring Modi's digital profile since 2014
 unhone 13 march, 2019 se 3,40,000 twits main se congress netaaon ke 2,095 or bhaajapa netaaon ke 2,836 twits ke aankadon kaa vishleshan kiya he taaki yah dikhaaya ja sake ki bhaajapa or congress donon hi partiyaan, lagbhag samaan rup se 'chaukeedaar' shabd kaa upyog kar rahi hai
 Says Pal, "I believe this is as big an issue for the Congress as it is for the BJP
" yah abhiyaan 'beti ke saath selfi' abhiyaan jitna prabhavi nahin he
 "however, noted advertising filmmaker Piyush Pandey says," i think the films have been very effective as a campaign
 har koi is baat se sahamat he
 "A member of Team Modi states that the campaign was the Prime Minister's idea
 unhone kaha, ''filmein puri tarah se unke dimag or piemo kii upaj hai
 "brand strategists believe that Modi is the only global leader equipped with such an influential brand strategy and has the ability to create a different strategy for each digital platform
 unke mutabik, yahaan tak ki jo modi ke dhur samarthak nahin hai, un logon ne bhi is abhiyaan par dhyaan diya he
 In fact, anyone who tweeted with # maibhichowkidar received a personal message from the Prime Minister
 agle abhiyaan chaukeedaar cap or tii-shart kii bikri ke honge
 On the other hand, the Congress has started a Twitter handle named 'chowkidar Chor Hai' to defeat these efforts of Modi and is sharpening its campaign against him
 lekin pradhanmantri ke paas isse nipatane kii yojana bhi taiyaar he
 It would be one of the last electoral weapons of his arsenal — a film that would depict the usual lifestyle of anonymity away from the glitter of his relatives

 Obviously, there will be many interesting turns in these elections
 *** The old political equations of Uttar Pradesh are seen to be destroyed due to Priyanka Gandhi's entry into active politics
 priyanka gandhi ko congress kaa mahasachiv banaae jane se chunaav main phayda ho yaa na ho lekin party kaaryakartaaon main josh jarur najar aa rahaa he
 Seeing this, in the last election, the sentiments of those who call Narendra Modi a magician are also changing
 ek daur main congress ko pani pi-pi kar kosne vaale baba ramdev kaa dil bhi pighalane laga he or wo priyanka ko dyneemic bahan bataa rahe hai
 In a special conversation with Aaj Tak, Baba Ramdev said on the comparison of PM Narendra Modi and Priyanka Gandhi, 'modi's personality is very big
 vah desh ke liye 18-18 ghante kaam karte hai
 We still have the best wishes for Modi ji, but Priyanka ji is a dynamic sister
 ' haalanki saath hi unhone kaha ki priyanka ji kaa raajnneetik anubhav or desh ke liye yogadan modi ji jitna nahin he
 Maybe she will contest elections in the coming days, Soniaji's age is also quite old
 ramdev ne kaha ki priyanka apni kii maa kii sansadeey seat raibareli se chunaav lard sakati hai
 She will have to show what she can do about the creation of the country
 is samay priyanka or modi kii tulana karnaa sahi nahin he
 Both have different age and experience
 haalanki ramdev ne narendra modi or priyanka gandhi main santulan saadhane kii bahut koshish kii, lekin aakhir main priyanka kii khulkar tarif karte-karte rah gaye
 Whereas there was a time when he saw the seeds of India's plight in the Gandhi family
 itnaa hi nahin vah sonia gandhi se lekar rahul gandhi tak ko khuleam koste najar aate the
 With Priyanka's entry, BJP first targeted familism, but did not succeed
 yahi vajah thi ki agle hi din bijepi ne apni ranneeti main badlaav karte hue kehane lagi ki priyanka ke aane se koi fark nahin padegaa
 Several BJP leaders, including UP Deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya to Union Minister Manoj Sinha, are saying that Priyanka Gandhi's arrival will not make any difference in UP politics
 bijepi bhale hi kahe ki priyanka ke aane se koi fark nahin pade, lekin endie ke sahyogi dal priyanka gandhi kii tarif karne main lage hue hai
 Shiv Sena has started seeing Indira Gandhi in Priyanka
 prinyaka kii raajnneeti main entry ke baad unhen upi main congress kaa cheharaa banaakar pesh kiya ja rahaa he
 It is believed that one of the reasons behind this is to force both parties to include SP-BSP alliance in Congress

 Honorable President, i am very distressed by the events of the last few days

 It is very important for the progress and progress of our country
 mananeey adhyaksha ji, mahaj ichha hamaare jivan ko bhrashtachar se mukt nahin kar sakati
 a comprehensive framework for eradicating corruption and an organized unanimous political program will need to be implemented from top to bottom
 sabase jaruri baat yah he ki uske liye raajnneetik ichha shakti kii jarurat hogi
 Honorable President, in the last few years i have visited every corner of the country
 main desh ke saikadon logon se chaahe garib hon yaa amir, vruddh ho yaa noujvaan, shashakt ho yaa nishakt se mila hum jinhone vyavastha se mohabhang ko abhivyakt kiya he
 Anna ji has given voice to the fury arising out of our system
 main iske liye unka dhanyavad karata hum
 i think the right question before us is that are we ready for this direct war against people's representative corruption? This question is not just about stopping this stalemate
 yah ek badi ladaai he
 There is no simple solution
 bhrashtachar ko mitaane ke liye nirantar patibaddhta or gahari sambhddhata kii jarurat he
 On witnessing the events of the past, it seems that with the enactment of a law, corruption will be eradicated from the whole society
 mujhe is baat par gaharaa andeh he
 An effective Lokpal is legally a means of fighting against corruption
 kintu sirf lokapal bhrashtacharheen aacharan ke liye paryaapt vikalp nahin he

 Honorable President, law and institution is not enough
 bhrashtachar se ladane ke liye pratinidhitiv- kaari, samaveshi or sugam loktantr kii jarurat he
 Many people have inspired and agitated the people of the country for freedom and progress of the country
 kintu vyaktigat bhaavana chaahe kitne bhi achche uddeshy ke liye ho, usase loktantric prakriya kamazor nahin honi chahie
 This process is long and difficult, but its length is necessary for it to be inclusive and fair
 vah prakriya ek paardarshee or samaveshi madhyam bane jisase vichaaron ko kanoonee rup diya ja sake
 It is the elected government that preserves the highness of Parliament

 ' abu dhabi kii vimaan company aitihaad ke saath jet airways ke 24 pratishat hissedari bikri ke liye sauda kar chuke company ke chairman naresh goyal ne kaha ki is ranneetik gathjod se jet kaa munafa badhegaa or kharche kam honge
 Speaking on the proposal, Jet Airways share holders' special meeting (EGM) said, "etihad's investment will help reduce our debt and grow strongly
" aitihaad ko variyata ke aadhaar par share aavantit karne ke prastaav ko manjuuri mil gai he, par yah sauda niamkeey prakriyaaon ko puraa karne ke baad hi prabhavi hoga
 The comments ullekhneey he ki is saude par bhartiya pratispardhaa ayog, bhartiya pratibhuti evam vinimay board (sebi) samet anya niamkeey agenciyon kii nigaah he
 Goyal said the commercial deal would help Etihad expand its flight, reduce costs and increase its profits
 saude ke anusaar aitihaad kareeb 2,058 karod rupee main jet airways kii 24 fisadi hissedari hasil karegi
 This will be the first direct investment by a foreign airline into an Indian airline after a change in the country's foreign direct policy in September last year
 donon companiyon ne kaha he ki is saude ke baad bhi jet airways main badi hissedari or iskaa prabhavi niyantran bharatiyon ke haath main rahegaa
 Goyal will remain its non-executive chairman with a 51 percent stake
 is prastaav par jet airways ke share dharakon kii vishesh baithak (ijiem) main goyal ne kaha, aitihaad ke nivesh se hamaare karj main kami karne or majbootee ke saath vruddhi karne main madad milegi
 The proposal to allocate shares on the basis of preference to Etihad has been approved, but the deal will be effective only after completing regulatory procedures
 tippaniyan It is noteworthy that other regulatory agencies including Competition Commission of India, Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) are eyeing the deal
 goyal ne kaha, vyavsaayik samjhaute se aitihaad ko apni udaan vistaar main madad milegi, laagat ghategi or iskaa munafa badhegaa
 According to the deal, Etihad will acquire a 24 per cent stake in Jet Airways for about Rs 2,058 crore

 Both companies have said that even after this deal, a large stake in Jet Airways and its effective control will remain in the hands of Indians

 sarkaar ne somvaar shaam ko jaise hi elaan kiya ki ‘institution of Eminence’ (utkrisht) ke liye desh ke chah shikshan sansthaanon main jeeyo institute ko bhi short list kiya gaya he, to har taraf tamaam tarah ke sawaal kiye jane lage
 One such question was that how can an institution that cannot be found in Google search be given the status of an excellent institution
 'india today' kii viral test team ne apni padtaal main paaya ki jo log ye sawaal uthaa rahe hai, unhone apana homework thik tarah se nahin kiya
 The social media Parzio Institute remains the most trending topic
 aalochakon kaa kahana he ki modi sarkaar kii ore se mukesh ambani ko khush karne ke liye ye faisla kiya gaya
 The main opposition party used this to use the 'suit boot ki sarkar' jumla for the Modi government
 dekhte hi dekhte jeeyo institute kaa ek parody acount bhi saamne aa gaya
 Many tweets were made from this Twitter handle, pinching Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Mukesh Ambani
 inhen ramchandra guha jaise namchin vyaktiyon ne share bhi kiya
 BJP leader Yashwant Sinha also questioned how an institution that has not yet come into existence can be given the title of excellence
 is prakaran main aalochakon kii ore se mote taur par teen pahaluon par jor diya gaya
 1 How can an institution be declared excellent even before it comes into existence? 2 Why is the Jio Institute of Reliance Foundation to be given Rs 1,000 crore from the government while it is backed by the richest person in the country? 3 Is Private Jio Institute was chosen by ignoring the other applicants from the sector? All the above three speculations are far from reality
 aise main kayaas lagane waalon ko sach jaanane ke liye google par kuch or baton ko bhi talashne kii aavashyaktaa thi
 Whether or not the Modi government is inclined towards Ambanis may be a matter of debate, but critics are on slippery ground in the Jio Institute episode
 vishvavidhyalay anudaan ayog (ujisi) ne sitambar 2017 main ek vigyaapan ke jariye ‘institution of Eminence’ ke liye prastaav maange the
 In that advertisement it was clearly mentioned that there are three different categories for application
 teesri shrenee ‘nae santhaan sthapit karne ke liye sanghathanon ko sponcer’ karne kii thi
 By this category it was clear that such institutions which have not come into existence can also apply, provided they fulfill other conditions
 jeeyo isi teesri shrenee ke tahat shortlist hua he
 It is also important to mention here that Jio has not yet been given the status of excellent institution
 jeeyo ko sirf aisa santhaan banane ke liye short list kiya gaya he
 Higher Education Secretary r Subrahmanyam clarifies this regard, saying, "so far he has only been given a letter of intent
 ”ab aate hai is kayaas par ki kya jeeyo institute ko sarkaar kii ore se 1,000 karod rupye die jaaenge jaisaa ki aarope lagaaya ja rahaa he
 So the answer is clear 'no'
 sirf chuninda sarkari sansthaanon ko hi vittiya sahaayta milegi
 The third thing is why only Jio was selected while ten more applicants also applied in this category
 ( wo jo nae santhaan bananaa chaahate hai
 ) This question can be answered only after reading in detail the application of all other 10 applicants
 kya ve sabhi anya sharton jaise ki jameen kii uplabdhta, vittiya majbootee or amal ke liye vistrut plan ko puraa karte hai
 The government insists on this subject, saying that shortlisting six institutions does not mean that the whole process is over
 14 or sansthaanon kii pahchaan kii jaaegi or ye kaam pragati par he
 Railways have changed the rules for giving tickets to senior citizens at concessional rates
 nae niyam ke mutabik senior citigens ko di jane vaali riyaayat sirf or sirf aise bhartiya nagarikon ko hi milegi jo sthaayee rup se bharat main rah rahe hon
 Till now the railway has been giving concession to all the senior citizens of foreign countries
 iskaa sidhaa sa matlab ye hua ki ab railway tikat mencenior citigenski riyaayat videshi or enarai nagarikon ko nahin mila karegi
 Under the Senior Citizens' Concession, the Railways give 40% concession to all its tickets and 50% concession to women
 58 saal yaa isse zyada aayu kii mahila or 60 saal yaa isse zyada aayu ke purush ko senior citigen mana jaataa he
 According to the revised rules of the Railways, only and only Indian citizens will get the benefit of the concession given under the Senior Citizen
 iskaa sidhaa sa matlab ye hua ki nepal or pakistan samet sabhi videshi deshon ke nagarikon ko ab bhartiya railway main safai karne par senior citigen ke taur par milane vaali riyaayat ab nahin mila karegi
 According to the railways, in the last financial year 2015-16, 465
5 million senior citizens traveled by railway
 inamen se 14,72,476 senior citigens ne rail tikat main di jane vaali riyaayat ko nahin lene kaa vikalp chunaa
 It is worth noting that in the year after year, in various ticket concessions, the Railways gives a subsidy of about 1500 crores
 inamen se 1100 karod rupee kii riyaayat senior citigens ko milti he
 Railways is now focusing on how to increase the revenue of the railways and for this, there is a direct way that people should automatically give up the concession in railway tickets
 iske liye railway ne logon ko samajhaana or jaagruk karnaa beete june se shuru kar diya tha
 Railways hope that the economically competent senior citizens will not accept the concession given in the rail ticket
 isi ummid ke sahare railway ne tikat booking ko formon main kiraye main riyaayat ko lene yaa na lene ke vikalp ko ab online booking main daal diya gaya tha
 It did not affect people very much
 is liye railway senior citigens par sabsidi kaa boj kam karne ke liye nayaa kadam uthaaya

 According to the police, a total of 25 cases have been registered against this accused named Rahul Patil in several police stations in Sinnar, Nashik, Kalyan, Kolhapur, Satara, Thane and Mumbai too
 tippaniyan According to the information, on July 7, a woman filed a complaint of cheating, rape and robbery in the name of Vile Parle Police

 kareeb ek maheene pehle hong-kong kii audio profeshnal company sound van ne apana bluetooth audio spikar BEAST launch kiya tha
 Interested customers can buy it from Amazon, Flipkart or Paytm for Rs 1,990
 hamane is spikar ko kaaphi dinon tak upyog kiya he or ab iskaa rivyuu aap tak pahunchaa rahe hai
 Build quality and features: The size of this speaker is quite small and it is cylindrical in shape
 isamen drivers ke upar metal kaa cover diya gaya he or uske upar rabar kii coating di gai he
 Rubber coating makes it the most rough and tough
 yani rabar kii coating spikar ke chaaron taraf maujuud hone kii vajah se ise bina kisi chintaa ke hi upyog kiya ja saktaa he
 Apart from being low weight, it also has a hook to hang it
 iske rhite taraf wolum batan or power batan die gaye hai
 Also, LED light indicators are also present in it
 saare hi batan kaaphi behatar kaam karte hai or majboot hai
 On the left side is the Ox in (3
 5mm) or micro-usb charging port diya gaya he
 Explain that both the aux cable and cable is provided in the box
 haalanki yahaan par ye bataanaa jaruri he ki charging port thodaa looj maaloom padataa he
 Talking about the rest of the features, a built-in microphone has been given in it, which is not usually given speakers of this range
 ye spikar IPX5 reating vaala he, aise main ise zyada tej barish main upyog nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 Bluetooth 4 for connectivity in it
 1 maujuud he
 Its battery 3
 7v2000mah kii he, jise richarge kiya ja saktaa he
 Performance: First of all, if you talk about the connectivity options, then this speaker is Bluetooth 4
 1 ke jariye conect kiya ja saktaa he or ox in cabel ke jariye bhi
 That is, it can also be used with non Bluetooth devices
 connactivity ke lihaaj se ye spikar kamaal kaa he
 You can use it comfortably in a distance of up to 20 meters without losing connectivity
 duusari baat ise iphone, ipad, ipod, Mac, android smartfones, tablet, laptops or krombuks main bhi conect kar sakate hai
 However one thing we did notice is that sometimes this speaker loses its connectivity on the go
 saath hi bluetooth ke mukaable ise ox se jode jane par audio quality kaaphi behatar najar aati he
 Talking about built in microphone, it can also be used in a much better way and good sound quality is maintained
 jahaan tak bydaree kii baat he to company kaa daawa tha ki isamen single charge par 8 ghante tak istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 However, the condition was that the voice be limited to 65 percent
 aise main company kaa daawa yahaan sahi thahartaa he
 Also, the low battery does not reduce the sound of the speaker
 audiocompany kaa daawa tha ki ye spikar base ke liye khaas taur par banaaya gaya he
 It has two drivers of 5W
 hamaari testing ke hisaab se company ne base ko to behatar banaaya he lekin kahin naa kahin Highs ko miss kiya he
 In other words, audio quality is crisp missing
 haalanki phul sound main gane play karne par bhi aawaaj main kahin nois nahin aati joki bahut acchhee baat he
 Apart from this, the most important thing is that the loudness of this speaker is the best
 faislashandaar base, lambii bydaree, connactivity or bilt quality behtareen he
 Built-in microphones make it even better
 haalanki spikar water racistant nahin he or total audio quality ko lekar thodi mushkil jarur ho sakati he
 But the speaker in the range of Rs 2,000 can be considered a better option
 saath hi 1 saal kii varantee bhi milegi, jise graahak phaayde ke taur par dekh sakate hai
 Rating - 3
 5 / 5 This time the results of the Lok Sabha elections were very shocking in many respects
 chunaav main is baar upi se koi bhi muslim ummidavaar jeet hasil nahin kar sakaa
 This thing is also surprising to political pundits
 kis party ne utaare kitne muslim ummidavaar
 
 
 This time in UP, the Samajwadi Party fielded 14, the Bahujan Samaj Party 19 and the Congress fielded nine Muslim candidates
 inamen se zyaadaatar siten muslim bahul ilaakon kii hi thim
 Despite this, no Muslim could manage to get the Lok Sabha route from here
 modi ke vikasvaadi agenda ko mila bhavaupi main narendra modi kii aisi lahar chali ki bijepi ne pradesh kii 80 main se 73 siton par kabja jamaa liya
 The BJP, which emerged as the single largest party, did not give tickets to any Muslim
 janata ne modi or unke vikaas ke agenda ko tarjeeh dene kaa behatar samajha
 Till now, the people of the Muslim community have been using politics like vote bank, but such people will have to decide their policies once again
 desh ke itihaas main aisa pehali baar hi hua ki upi ke muslimon kaa pratinidhitiv karne vaala koi netaa loksabhaa kii dahalij tak nahin pahunch sakaa
 The regional parties of UP used to cash in their votes by showing fear of alleged communal parties to Muslims
 lekin is baar in partiyon kii yah chaal naakaam rahi
 This time the public considered it more appropriate to bow down to Modi's work and charisma
 is lihaaj se dekhen, to upi main loksabhaa chunaav raajnneeti ke liye kai bade sabak chhod gaya

 vruddh babaaji garaje, ''main sharaab peetaa hum lekin main sharaab ko mujhe pine nahin detaa
 "when i heard that monk saying this, i had already crossed the age of thirty
 ve birbhum ke ek gaanv main apni jhopadi ke baahar baithe hue the
 That winter night everyone was drinking rum which our stroller team brought from Calcutta with them
 babaaji ke yuva shishyon main se ek ne sharaab ke saath thodi zyada hi dosti kar lee thi or vah baakiyon se kahin zyada tej gati se use gatke ja rahaa tha
 His old master scolded him tightly for taking Old Monk more, and then sent him to sleep
 mujhe babaaji kii baat ko samajhane main thodaa vakt laga
 But then when i spent some time with Baul and Vaishnava sadhus, i saw that this is said a lot
 thodaa-bahut antar ho jaataa tha kyonki sharaab—jo bangla main madh thi—vah ganja yaa khaali nesha kaa rup le leti thi
 Nesha probably came from the addiction of Hindustani - "ami nesha kori, nesha amake kore na", ie i am intoxicated, not intoxicated
 matlab saaf tha, nashili chizon kaa sevel bhale hi karo lekin use apane sir chadhgaye na do, nashe kii lat ko aapako kaabo main karne na do
 i used to come from a family and culture where drinking alcohol was considered a curse
 maa-baap main se koi bhi nahin peetaa tha, khaas taur par maa to sharaab pine waalon ko galij samajhati thim
 For him, all the drinkers were addicts, irrespective of who they were drinking and whoever they were — an actor on the cinema screen, or a person sitting at the side table in a restaurant or a close friend
 duniya ko lekar is shastreey bhartiya madhyavargeey nazariye main shaleenta or naagarik naitikta par do taraf se lagaataar hamalaa ho rahaa thah ek to garib or nichali jatiyon se jinke aadmi sara paisa sharaab main uda dete the, or phir pashchimi-videshiyon se yaa paashchaatya bharatiyon se
 Both the parents had taken part in the freedom struggle and at least for the mother we need freedom from the slavery of liquor along with other things
 vicitra baat yah he ki is nazariye main ek ajeebogareeb ghalmail or bhagidaari bhi dekhne ko mili
 Not only the completely hypocritical and deeply alcoholic commercial cine-makers of Bombay, Calcutta and Madras, but also serious directors of Calcutta like Satyajit Ray, Ritwik Ghatak and Mrinal Sen, to some extent 'nightclubs' were born of dangerous alcoholism
 -squares shown as a bastion of western imitation dissipation
 duniya ke us nazariye ko lekar bada hote hue, maa kii tarah yah yakeen kar lenaa swaabhaavik tha ki 'asli' bharat mote taur par shaakaahaari, gomance na khaane vaali, sharaab na pine vaali samskruti kaa tha
 Just because of some fatal external impact, that culture has got some stains
 wo to jab maine thodaa-thodaa maansaahaar shuru kiya or alag-alag tarah kii sharaab chakhne laga tab jaakar meri ankhen khuleen
 Most people in India were non-vegetarians, and many of those who were vegetarians were not vegetarians because of their choice — they started buying and eating meat as soon as they reached a slightly better economic status
 isi tarah bharat main sharaab kii samskruti bhi puraani rahi he or yah angrejon ke bharat aane se bahut pehle kii he
 But it all became distorted and buried
 ek to angreji raaj ke kaaran or duusare, aazaadee kii ladaai kii ardh-victorian naitikta ke chalate jo is sabakaa virodh karti thi
 Drinking regularly does not mean getting drunk regularly, and sometimes drunkenness does not mean that you are an alcoholic and a threat to society
 jaise-jaise main bada hua, paaya ki bharat main sharaab pine kii kai samskritiyaan hai
 For example, drinking alcohol in the urban working class is very painful, a stress-causing cause that actually becomes the cause of stress and violence in the existence of a poor person
 main shuru main jis samskruti kaa hissaa bana vah 'sharaab kii shahari madhya-vargeey' samskruti kahi ja sakati he
 This was an environment in which alcohol was usually drunk before dinner, whether or not there was a special occasion
 vahaan din main sharaab pinaa keval saptahanth ke liye hi simit tha
 In corporate circles, drinking alcohol can be a routine task, almost associated with work
 puraane shahi pariwaron main sharaab ek alag hi cheez thi jaisi ki sharaab pine vaale bharat ke ati-sampann varg ke maamle main
 There she was also a symbol of wealth, prosperity and endless free time and often a heavy mortal burden around the throat and liver
 bhartiya samaaj ke baaki tabakon main sharaab paaramparik thi, goa se lekar guwahati tak vah niyamit jivan kaa bhi hissaa thi or khaas maukon kaa bhi
 Parallel to the tribal sections of India, locally made araq or liquor was at the center of their life infrastructure
 angreji raaj ke taabedaaron ne 19veen sadi main isse chhedchhad kii koshish kii jiske gambhir nattejey hue
 Then debt and alcoholism took root there, which was never there before
 dakshin gujarat main aisi hi ek sthiti kaa saamana sanyam-pasand mohandas karamchand gandhi ko 1920 ke dashak ke shuruaati saalon main karnaa padaa
 The tribals were banned from making their own toddy and mahua, then the exploitative Parsi liquor manufacturers started mixing industrial alcohols in these traditional liquors to make them faster, so that they could extend their storage period
 isse adivasee tadi kii dukaanon ke maalikon kaa shikaar hone lage
 At first, they got into debt and then when they had no money left to buy liquor, their lands were taken away
 nashe kii lat kaa shikaar hokar phir ve unheen jameenon par bandhua majdoor banakar kaam karne lage jin kheton ke kabhi ve maalik hua karte the
 While Gandhi continued to advocate abstinence, many leaders around him continued to drink, even if only a little restrained
 isliye koi hairat kii baat nahin thi ki motilal nehru jaise shakchas ne unhen ek kaaphi vinamr lekin spasht khat likhakar kaha ki apane vivek main ve kabhi bhi sharaab bilkul band karne par sahamat nahin ho sakate
 We know that Indians will continue to drink alcohol whether they find it legally-illegally in plastic pouches or in gas cylinders or any alcohol smuggler is being delivered to their house
 ham jaanate hai ki pehle kii tulana main kahin zyada bharatiyon kaa un samskritiyon se sampark ho rahaa he jahaan sharaab pinaa yaa maance khaanaa koi varjana nahin he
 We also know that we want to invite people from these different cultures to invest in us and also want their people to come and work in the factories and ports they are establishing
 hamaare kaayar va galat dimag vaale netaa is bare main kuch nahin karenge kyonki unki nigahen alpavadhi phaaydon par hai
 But we know that we need freedom from the 19th's perceptions about alcohol and the drinking practices of 20th century Indians

 The BJP has done very well in the local civic elections in Maharashtra amid speculation of demonetisation's political gains and losses
 147 municipal counsillon or 17 panchayaton kii 3727 siton ke liye 27 november ko matdaan hue the
 BJP has done its performance much better than before
 kehane vaale to yahi kahenge ki sthaneey nikaayon ke chunaav alag muddon par hote hai, lekin agar bijepi haar jaati to yah to kaha hi jaataa ki notebandi ke kaaran haari he
 So demonetisation may not contribute to its victory, but at the moment when there is so much political turmoil, bjp's performance in the civic elections in Maharashtra is encouraging for the party as well as a signal for the opponents
 agar notebandi kaa asar nahin he to in chunaavon main virdohi kyon haare, iskaa moolyankan to unhen karnaa hi chahie or bijepi kii jeet ko sweekaar bhi karnaa chahie kyonki ye matdaan notebandi ke 16 din biit jane ke baad 27 november ko hue hai
 Congress and NCP have fought separately in this election
 bijepi or shivasena milakar chunaav lade hai, magar kahin kahin alag-alag bhi rahe
 The BJP won 893 seats out of 3727 seats in the civic elections held in Maharashtra
 notebandi kaa virodh karne vaali shivasena ne 529 siten jiti hai
 The BJP has improved its performance more than three times in a way
 2011 ke chunaav main use 298 siten mili thim lekin is baar 893 siten mili hai
 On the other hand, Shiv Sena has doubled its performance by winning 529 seats compared to 264 seats in 2011
 congress ke paas pichley chunaav main 771 siten thim, jo ghatakar 727 rah gai hai
 The NCP had 916 seats in 2011, which has come down to 615
 is tarah se dekhenge to sabase adhik nuksaan ensipi ko hua he or sabase adhik phayda bijepi ko hua he
 If demonetisation is the reason, the Shiv Sena has also opposed demonetisation, yet its seats are doubled
 notebandi kaa paimaana banaakar dekhenge to iskaa virodh karne vaali shivasena, congress or ensipi ko 3727 main se 1871 siten mili hai
 893 seats to BJP implementing demonetisation
 bijepi zarur akele bade dal ke rup main ubhari he
 Out of 3727, Shiv Sena and BJP have got 1422 seats in total
 congress or ensipi ko mila den to ye sankhya 1342 ho jaati he
 There is not much difference between the two camps in the total number
 is baar maharashtra ke nikaay chunaav main ek bada badlaav yah hua he ki alag se nagar adhyaksh kaa chunaav hua he
 Previously, the elected councilors used to elect the city president, but this time the city president has been directly elected by the public
 america ke presidential farm kii tarah
 Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis has said that 52 city presidents of BJP have won on their own and 8 with alliances
 is baar aisa bhi hua he ki nagar adhyaksh bijepi kaa, lekin sthaneey nikaay main bahumat kisi or dal kaa he
 Everyone knows that the reasons for victory in the local body elections are different, but when the BJP was defeated by demonetisation, then why not get Sehra on winning
 jaise jab notebandi lagu hui thi tab panwel main Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) ke chunaav main bijepi sabhi 17 siton par haar gai
 Peasants and Workers Party of India (PWP) won the maximum 15 seats, while its alliance partners Shiv Sena and Congress got one each
 us vakt bijepi ke virdohi dalon ne yahi kaha tha ki notebandi ke kaaran haar hui he
 There may be scholarly disagreement about the reasons, but this victory suggests that the BJP is a strong party at the organization level
 yah kaha ja rahaa he ki bijepi kii seat se ensipi yaa duusare dalon se aae ummidavaar bhi jite hai
 Its number is not there yet, but the BJP does not hesitate to bring the winning candidates of other parties
 peeche rah jane vaali congress or ensipi ko dekhnaa chahie ki kyon unke ummidavaar yaa netaa bijepi main chale jate hai
 Why their organization is so poor
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne is jeet par maharashtra bijepi ke kaaryakartaaon or mukhyamantri fadanvis ko badhai di he
 By-elections to local bodies were also held in Gujarat on 27 November
 yahaan bijepi ne 126 main se 109 siton par jeet hasil kii he
 Congress has got only 17 seats
 pehle yahaan bijepi ke paas 64 siten thim or congress ke paas 52 siten thim
 The victory of victory in these elections may not matter in the Lok Sabha or Assembly elections, but the future leaders of the party are born from here only
 congress kii haalat bataati he ki gujarat main uske bheetar netaa banane kii kshamta samaapt ho chuki he
 The comments vaapi nagarpalika upachunaavon kii 44 siton main se bijepi ko 41 siten mili hai
 Congress only three
 vaise yahaan hameshaa se bijepi kaa dabadabaa rahaa he
 In the surat-kanakpur-kansad municipal election, BJP won 27 seats out of 28 seats
 congress ne sirf ek seat hasil kii
 In the election of Gondal Tehsil Panchayat in Rajkot, BJP won 18 out of 22 seats
 ye nattejey bataate hai ki congress kaaphi lachar ho gai he
 She has not been able to stand in Gujarat yet and has not found a way to return to Maharashtra
 ye nattejey itnaa to bataate hi hai ki bijepi sthaneey str par kaaryakartaaon ko jitaane main safal ho rahi he
 Even when it was being said that the BJP has weakened since the Patel movement and the Dalit movement
 is lihaaz se bhi bijepi kii jeet myne rakhti he
 Prime Minister Modi has sent a salute to the people of Gujarat that their trust in the BJP remains
 is jeet ko bhrashtachar ke kilaaf unke abhiyaan ko mila samarthan bhi bataaya he
 After demonetisation, BJP was successful in many states from Lok Sabha to Assembly elections
 zaahir he bijepi is jeet par garv to karegi hi

 zaahir he bijepi is jeet par garv to karegi hi
 The Shiv Sena, Congress and NCP, opposing it, have got 1871 seats out of 3727
 notebandi lagu karne vaali bijepi ko 893 siten
 BJP has emerged as the single largest party
 3727 main se shivasena or bijepi ko kul milakar 1422 siten mili hai
 Combining Congress and NCP, this number becomes 1342
 total number main donon khemon ke bich bahut zyada kaa faasla nahin he
 This time there has been a big change in the civic elections in Maharashtra that a separate city president has been elected
 pehle jite hue parshad nagar adhyaksh chunate the magar is baar nagar adhyaksh kaa chunaav sidhe janata ne kiya he
 Like Presidential Farm of America
 mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis ne kaha he ki apane dam par bijepi ke 52 nagar adhyaksh jite hai or gathjod ke saath 8
 This time it has also happened that the BJP president is the majority of the BJP, but the majority in the local body
 har kisi ko pataa he ki sthaneey nikaay ke chunaavon main jeet ke kaaran alag hote hai, lekin jab haarane par bijepi ke maththe notebandi madh di jaati to jeetne par sehara kyon na mili
 Like when the demonetisation came into force, the BJP lost all 17 seats in the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) election in Panvel
 sabase zyaada 15 siten Peasants and Workers Party of India (PWP) ne hasil kin, jabaki uski gathbandhan sahyogi shivasena or congress ko ek-ek siten milin
 At that time, the anti-bjp parties had said that due to demonetisation, the defeat was lost
 kaarnon ko lekar vidwaanon main asahmati ho sakati he lekin yah jeet bataati he ki sanghathan ke str par bijepi ek majboot dal he
 It is being said that candidates from NCP or other parties have also won from BJP seat
 isaki sankhya to abhi nahin he lekin bijepi duusare dalon ke jitau ummidavaaron ko apane yahaan laane main sankoch nahin karti he
 The lagging Congress and NCP should see why their candidates or leaders join the BJP
 kyon unka sanghathan itnaa lachar he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has congratulated Maharashtra BJP workers and Chief Minister Fadnavis on this victory
 27 november ko gujarat main bhi sthaneey nikaayon ke upachunaav hue the
 Here BJP has won 109 out of 126 seats
 congress ko sirf 17 siten mili hai
 Earlier BJP had 64 seats and Congress had 52 seats
 in chunaavon main haar jeet kaa loksabhaa yaa vidhansabha ke chunaavon par bhale na fark padataa ho, lekin party ke bhavi netaa to yaheen se paidaa hote hai
 The condition of the Congress indicates that its capacity to make leaders within Gujarat has been exhausted
 tippaniyan BJP has got 41 seats out of 44 seats in Vapi municipal by-elections
 congress ko sirf teen
 By the way, there has always been a BJP dominance here
 surat-kanakpur-consaad nagarpalika chunaav main 28 siton main se bijepi ne 27 siton par jeet hasil kin
 The Congress won only one seat
 rajkot main gondal tehsil panchayat ke chunaav main bijepi ne 22 main se 18 siten hasil kin
 These results show that the Congress has become very poor
 wo abhi tak gujarat main khadi nahin ho pai he or maharashtra main vaapasi kaa rasta nahin khoj pai he
 These results show that the BJP is succeeding in winning the local workers
 tab bhi jab yah kaha ja rahaa tha ki patel andolan or dalit andolan ke baad se bijepi kamazor hui he
 In this context, bjp's victory also matters
 pradhanmantri modi ne gujarat kii janata ko salaam bheja he ki bijepi main unka bharosa bana hua he
 This victory is also said to have received support for his campaign against corruption
 notebandi ke baad kai rajyon main loksabhaa se lekar vidhansabha chunaavon main bijepi ko safalataa mili thi
 It is obvious that BJP will be proud of this victory
 is baar maharashtra ke nikaay chunaav main ek bada badlaav yah hua he ki alag se nagar adhyaksh kaa chunaav hua he
 Previously, the elected councilors used to elect the city president, but this time the city president has been directly elected by the public
 america ke presidential farm kii tarah
 Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis has said that 52 city presidents of BJP have won on their own and 8 with alliances

 The car, which was bought at an auction of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim's goods, was burnt in Ghaziabad on Wednesday
 aatankwaad ke khilaaf virodh jataane ke liye hindu mahasabha ne aisa kiya he

 Many times it seems that after life there is something left on this earth, that is insurance

 There is a rapid change happening around us
 bhale hi vyapak rup se iske samarthan yaa virodh kii raajnneetik sakriyata nazar na aati ho lekin beemaa raajnneetik shabdaawalee main apni jagah banane laga he
 In America, there was a fierce debate for two-three years about the insurance of Obama Health Care, but in our country, the government launches insurance schemes and political parties do not discuss it
 iske baad bhi beemaa hamaari raajnneeti kaa nayaa daanv he jise samajhane ke liye do udhaaharan detaa hum
 On Tuesday, Union Human Resource Minister Smriti Irani said that on May 26, under Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana, five thousand people below poverty line will be covered by accident insurance in every assembly constituency and the first premium of this insurance will be self-paid
 pradhanmantri suraksha beemaa yojana kaa salanaa premium 12 rupaya he
 There are five assembly constituencies in Amethi, so Smriti will insure 60,000 people for just Rs 7 lakh 20 thousand
 pradhanmantri jivan jyoti beemaa main durghatana, prakritik aapadaa or swaabhaavik maut ke baad do lakh kaa beemaa he jiskaa salanaa premium he 330 rupaya
 If Smriti Irani had promised a premium of 330, she would have had to pay one crore 98 lakh rupees for sixty thousand people
 haa agar rahul gandhi chahen to smriti ko chunauti dene ke liye ek karod 98 lakh kaa premium de sakate hai
 If such a race for votes starts, the public can benefit greatly
 netaa or beemaa company ko bhi laabh hoga
 Leaders can also promote the insurance of a particular company
 ab doosraa udhaaharan bhi mahatvapurn he
 Crores of farmers have a Kisan Credit Card
 kai rajya main kisaan credit card ke saath beemaa anivaary he or kai vikalp ke taur par he
 VM Singh of Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Sangathan Union has filed a PIL in the Allahabad High Court, on the basis of which the court has told that according to a 2012 circular of the Reserve Bank of India, while giving loans for crops through the Kisan Credit Card to the banks Essentially insurance also has to be done
 viem singh ne kaha ki kuch bainkon ne kisaanon se premium bhi liya magar use waapas kar diya yani unki manamaani chali
 Some banks did not insure at all
 kai baar kisaan khud beemaa nahin lete hai kyonki ek vyakti ke nuksaan par beemaa nahin miltaa he
 Insurance will be provided only if 33 percent of the crops of 5-6 villages are destroyed
 ab elahabaad hai court ne centre sarkaar, rajya sarkaar or bhartiya reserve bank se poocha he ki kya credit card ke saath beemaa anivaary he
 If the answer is yes, then it may benefit one crore sixty lakh farmers of UP
 24 april ke times aaf india main deshdeep saxena kii bhopal se khabar he ki farzi kisaan credit card banavaakar 5 karod lone nikaal liya gaya or jab kisaanon ko vasuuli kaa notice pahunchaa to hadakamp much gaya
 All this also happens
 to beemaa ko lekar raajnneetik sakriyata kis tarah se bad rahi he
 i wish there was a government hospital and doctors in the villages to save my life
 bade netaa to helicopter se ladakar dilli gudgaanv ke privet aspataalon main bhartee kar diye jate hai
 Most of the people i spoke to about the two insurance schemes that the Prime Minister has launched, said that there is curiosity and enthusiasm in the market
 ek to premium bahut sasta he or doosraa kaagazi karrwai kaaphi saral kar di gai he
 Now let me tell you two stories
 san 1706 main landan main wiliam talebot or thamal alan ne duniya kii pehali beemaa company amicable socity kii sthapana kii
 To make a profit, the company added a new rule in insurance that only those between 12 and 45 years of age would get the benefit of accident insurance
 kyonki 12 se 45 saal ke logon main mrityu dar kam thi or 45 saal ke baad premium se company ko kaaphi munafa ho jaataa tha
 This model was challenged by James Dadson
 55 saal ke is ganitagya ko jab company ne beemaa cover nahin diya to james or unke saathiyon ne beemaa niyamavali ko khub chunauti di
 After the death of James Dadson, one of his disciples formed a company called Society of Equitable Assurance where there was no age to take insurance
 inhone beemaa kii gananaa kis aadhaar par hogi uskaa bhi teble banaaya jiske raste chalata hua beemaa udyog aaj yahaan pahunchaa he
 Has the Government of India taken the 1706 model? 18 se 70, 18 se 50 saal ke logon ke liye alag-alag beemaa or 18 se 40 ke liye pension yojana
 To understand the Atal Pension Yojana, it is necessary to compare it with the already existing Swavalamban Scheme, which is meant for all those working in the unorganized sector
 18 se saath saal ke logon ke liye he
 In Swavalamban Yojana, if you deposit 100 rupees every year, then the government will give 200 or 500, then the government will deposit 1000
 atal pension yojana main aap 100 rupaya jamaa karenge to sarkaar 50 degi or 500 denge to sarkaar 250 degi
 Will give maximum 1000 only
 donon hi yojanaon main sarkaar adhiktam 1000 rupee hi degi
 The case is complex, so forgive some errors
 atal pension yojana ke tahat aap 42 se 1452 rupee kii salanaa kisht dekar ek hazaar se lekar paanch hazaar tak kii pension paa sakate hai
 Its manual states that the government will give its share in the same accounts which will not be income tax payers
 umr ke lihaaz se swaavlamban yojana 18 se 60 saal tak ke liye he or 52 saal kii umr tak isse jud sakate hai
 You cannot join the Atal Pension Scheme after 40 but after sixty you will get pension
 maine beemaa pension kshetra main jude ek vyakti se baat kii
 Keep in mind that with only one person, he said that under the Swavalamban scheme, 38 lakh accounts were opened, then the agent used to get 100 rupees commission on each account
 isse gaanvon main kuch logon ko kaam mil gaya
 All work in the Atal Pension Yojana will be done through the bank
 kya isurance sector ko sahaara lene ke liye bainkon ke bane banaae dhaanche kaa istamaal kiya ja rahaa he
 The same agent said that in the last budget, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had launched another good scheme but the government is promoting it less
 tippaniyan Old Age Pension Scheme, it was started during the time of Atal Bihari Vajpayee but the UPA stopped it
 is yojana ke tahat aap saath saal se upar ke parijan ke liye ek mushth raashi dekar beemaa le sakate hai
 On depositing around 66 thousand to six lakhs, pension will start from next year itself
 iske tahat paanch sau se paanch hazaar kaa pension jivan bhar milegaa
 After the death of the person whose pension will be taken, the entire money will come into the nominee's account
 is yojana ke tahat nivesh karne par iskar chhot kaa bhi praavdhaan he
 The plan is for 15 August
 vaise agar aap bank main khaataa kholte hai to atm card miltaa he
 Many banks have an accident insurance with every ATM card that is available without premium
 debit or credit card par milane vaala durghatana beemaa paanch se pandrah lakh kaa bhi hota he
 State Bank of India gives accident insurance of two lakhs at a premium of Rs 100 annually to savings account holders
 to pradhanmantri jivan jyoti, suraksha beemaa yojana or atal pension yojana
 First talk on insurance then pension
 
 
 america main to obama health care naam ke beemaa ko lekar do teen saalon tak ghanghor bahes chali magar hamaare desh main sarkaar beemaa yojanaayen launch karti he or raajnneetik dal hi isaki charchaa nahin karte
 Even after this, insurance is the new bet of our politics, to give two examples to understand
 mangalvaar ko kendriya maanav sansaadhan mantri smriti irani ne kaha ki 26 may ko pradhanmantri suraksha beemaa yojana ke tahat har vidhansabha kshetra main garibi rekha se neeche ke paanch hazaar logon kaa durghatana beemaa karaayengi or is beemaa kaa pehla premium khud bharengi
 The annual premium of the Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana is 12 rupees
 amethi main paanch vidhansabha kshetra hai is lihaaz se smriti sirf 7 lakh 20 hazaar rupee main 60,000 logon kaa beemaa kara dengi
 Prime Minister Jeevan Jyoti Insurance has an insurance of two lakhs after an accident, natural disaster and natural death, whose annual premium is 330 rupees
 agar smriti irani ne 330 kaa premium dene kaa vaada kiya hota to unhen saath hazaar logon ke liye ek karod 98 lakh rupee dene pad jate
 Yes, if Rahul Gandhi wants, he can pay a premium of one crore 98 lakh to challenge Smriti
 vot ke liye aisi hode shuru ho jaae to public ko khub laabh ho saktaa he
 The leader and the insurance company will also benefit
 netaa kisi khaas company ke beemaa ko badhaava bhi de sakate hai
 Now the second example is also important
 karodon kisaanon ke paas kisaan credit card he
 Insurance with Kisan Credit Card is compulsory in many states and as an option
 rashtriya kisaan mazdoor sanghathan union ke viem singh ne elahabaad hai court main ek janhit yachika daayar kii he jiske aadhaar par adaalat se kaha he ki 2012 ke bhartiya rigerv bank ke ek circular ke anusaar bainkon ko kisaan credit card ke zariye fasalon ke liye karz dete vakt anivaary rup se beemaa bhi karnaa hoga
 VM Singh said that some banks also took premiums from the farmers but returned them, that is, they were arbitrary
 kuch bainkon ne beemaa hi nahin kiya
 Many times the farmers themselves do not take insurance because they do not get insurance on the loss of a person
 5-6 gaanv kii 33 pratishat fasal nasht hogi tabhi beemaa milegaa
 Now Allahabad High Court has asked the Central Government, State Government and Reserve Bank of India whether insurance with credit card is mandatory
 agar jawaab haa main aata he to isse upi ke ek karod saath lakh kisaanon ko laabh ho saktaa he
 In the Times of India on April 24, Deshdeep Saxena reports from Bhopal that 5 crore loan was taken out by getting a fake Kisan Credit Card and when farmers got the notice of recovery, there was a stir
 yah sab bhi hota he
 So how is political activism on insurance increasing? kaash jaan bachaa lene ke liye dhang ke sarkari aspataal hote or gaanvon main doctor bhi
 Big leaders are loaded into helicopters and admitted to private hospitals in Delhi Gurgaon
 pradhanmantri ne beemaa kii jin do yojanaon ko launch kiya he unke bare main maine jin logon se baat kii, zyaadaatar ne kaha ki market main jigyaasa or utsaah dekhne ko mil rahaa he
 One, the premium is very cheap and the second paperwork has been simplified considerably
 ab main aapako do kisse sunaata hum
 In 1706, William Talbot and Thomas Allen founded the world's first insurance company, Amicable Society, in London
 company ne munafa kamaane ke liye beemaa main ek nayaa niyam joda ki sirf 12 se 45 saal kii umr ke logon ko hi durghatana beemaa kaa laabh milegaa
 Because the death rate was lower in people between 12 and 45 years and after 45 years, the company would have made a lot of profit from the premium
 is model ko chunauti di james dadson ne
 When the company did not provide insurance cover to the 55-year-old mathematician, James and his colleagues challenged the insurance rules a lot
 james dadson ke nidhan ke baad unke ek shishy ne socity of equitable ashurence naam kii company banaai jahaan beemaa lene kii koi umr nahin thi
 He also made a table on the basis of how the insurance will be calculated, due to which the insurance industry has reached here today
 kya bharat sarkaar ne 1706 vaala model liya he
 Separate insurance for people aged 18 to 70, 18 to 50 years and pension scheme for 18 to 40 years
 atal pension yojana ko samajhane ke liye zaruri he ki isaki tulana pehle se chali aa rahi swaavlamban yojana se kii jaae jo asangathit kshetra main kaam karne vaale sabhi logon ke liye he
 For people aged 18 to sixty
 swaavlamban yojana main agar aap har saal 100 rupaya jamaa karenge to sarkaar har saal 200 degi yaa 500 denge to sarkaar 1000 jamaa karegi
 If you deposit 100 rupees in the Atal Pension Yojana, then the government will give 50 and if you give 500, the government will give 250
 adhiktam 1000 hi degi
 In both the schemes, the government will pay a maximum of Rs 1000 only
 maamla jatil he isliye kuch trutiyon ko maaf kijiega
 Under the Atal Pension Yojana, you can get a pension ranging from one thousand to five thousand by paying an annual installment of Rs 42 to 1452
 isaki niyamavali main likhaa he ki sarkaar unheen khaaton main apana hissaa degi jo iskar daata nahin honge
 In terms of age, the Swavalamban scheme is for 18 to 60 years and can be added till the age of 52 years
 atal pension yojana main 40 ke baad nahin jud sakate hai par saath ke baad pension milegi
 i spoke to a person involved in the insurance pension sector
 dhyaan rahe ki sirf ek vyakti se, unhone kaha ki swaavlamban yojana ke tahat 38 lakh khate khule to agent ko har khate par 100 rupaya kamishan miltaa tha
 This gave some people jobs in the villages
 atal pension yojana main sara kaam bank ke zariye hoga
 Is the infrastructure built by banks being used to support the insurance sector? usee agent ne kaha ki pichley bajet main vitt mantri arun jetali ne ek or acchhee yojana launch kii thi magar sarkaar uskaa kam prachaar kar rahi he
 The comments vriddhavastha pension yojana, ise atal bihari vaajapeyi ke samay shuru kiya gaya tha magar upie ne band kar diya
 Under this scheme, you can take insurance for families above sixty years by paying a lump sum
 kareeb 66 hazaar se chah lakh jamaa karne par agle saal se hi pension shuru ho jayega
 Under this, a pension of 500 to 5000 will be provided for life
 jiske naam se pension lenge uske nidhan ke baad puraa paisa nomini ke khate main aa jayega
 There is also a provision for income tax exemption on investment under this scheme
 yojana 15 agast tak ke liye he
 By the way if you open an account with a bank, you get an ATM card
 kai bank har atm card ke saath ek durghatana beemaa hota he jo bina premium ke miltaa he
 Accident insurance on debit and credit cards is also between five to fifteen lakhs
 state bank of india bachat khaataa dharakon ko salanaa 100 rupee ke premium par do lakh kaa durghatana beemaa detaa he
 So Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti, Suraksha Bima Yojana and Atal Pension Yojana
 pehle beemaa phir pension par baat
 
 
 On Tuesday, Union Human Resource Minister Smriti Irani said that on May 26, under Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana, five thousand people below poverty line will be covered by accident insurance in every assembly constituency and the first premium of this insurance will be self-paid
 pradhanmantri suraksha beemaa yojana kaa salanaa premium 12 rupaya he

 If Smriti Irani had promised a premium of 330, she would have had to pay one crore 98 lakh rupees for sixty thousand people
 haa agar rahul gandhi chahen to smriti ko chunauti dene ke liye ek karod 98 lakh kaa premium de sakate hai

 ab doosraa udhaaharan bhi mahatvapurn he
 Crores of farmers have a Kisan Credit Card
 kai rajya main kisaan credit card ke saath beemaa anivaary he or kai vikalp ke taur par he
 VM Singh of Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Sangathan Union has filed a PIL in the Allahabad High Court, on the basis of which the court has told that according to a 2012 circular of the Reserve Bank of India, while giving loans for crops through the Kisan Credit Card to the banks Essentially insurance also has to be done
 viem singh ne kaha ki kuch bainkon ne kisaanon se premium bhi liya magar use waapas kar diya yani unki manamaani chali
 Some banks did not insure at all
 kai baar kisaan khud beemaa nahin lete hai kyonki ek vyakti ke nuksaan par beemaa nahin miltaa he
 Insurance will be provided only if 33 percent of the crops of 5-6 villages are destroyed
 ab elahabaad hai court ne centre sarkaar, rajya sarkaar or bhartiya reserve bank se poocha he ki kya credit card ke saath beemaa anivaary he
 If the answer is yes, then it may benefit one crore sixty lakh farmers of UP
 24 april ke times aaf india main deshdeep saxena kii bhopal se khabar he ki farzi kisaan credit card banavaakar 5 karod lone nikaal liya gaya or jab kisaanon ko vasuuli kaa notice pahunchaa to hadakamp much gaya
 All this also happens
 to beemaa ko lekar raajnneetik sakriyata kis tarah se bad rahi he
 i wish there was a government hospital and doctors in the villages to save my life
 bade netaa to helicopter se ladakar dilli gudgaanv ke privet aspataalon main bhartee kar diye jate hai
 Most of the people i spoke to about the two insurance schemes that the Prime Minister has launched, said that there is curiosity and enthusiasm in the market
 ek to premium bahut sasta he or doosraa kaagazi karrwai kaaphi saral kar di gai he
 Now let me tell you two stories
 san 1706 main landan main wiliam talebot or thamal alan ne duniya kii pehali beemaa company amicable socity kii sthapana kii
 To make a profit, the company added a new rule in insurance that only those between 12 and 45 years of age would get the benefit of accident insurance
 kyonki 12 se 45 saal ke logon main mrityu dar kam thi or 45 saal ke baad premium se company ko kaaphi munafa ho jaataa tha
 This model was challenged by James Dadson
 55 saal ke is ganitagya ko jab company ne beemaa cover nahin diya to james or unke saathiyon ne beemaa niyamavali ko khub chunauti di
 After the death of James Dadson, one of his disciples formed a company called Society of Equitable Assurance where there was no age to take insurance
 inhone beemaa kii gananaa kis aadhaar par hogi uskaa bhi teble banaaya jiske raste chalata hua beemaa udyog aaj yahaan pahunchaa he
 Has the Government of India taken the 1706 model? 18 se 70, 18 se 50 saal ke logon ke liye alag-alag beemaa or 18 se 40 ke liye pension yojana
 To understand the Atal Pension Yojana, it is necessary to compare it with the already existing Swavalamban Scheme, which is meant for all those working in the unorganized sector
 18 se saath saal ke logon ke liye he
 In Swavalamban Yojana, if you deposit 100 rupees every year, then the government will give 200 or 500, then the government will deposit 1000
 atal pension yojana main aap 100 rupaya jamaa karenge to sarkaar 50 degi or 500 denge to sarkaar 250 degi
 Will give maximum 1000 only
 donon hi yojanaon main sarkaar adhiktam 1000 rupee hi degi
 The case is complex, so forgive some errors
 atal pension yojana ke tahat aap 42 se 1452 rupee kii salanaa kisht dekar ek hazaar se lekar paanch hazaar tak kii pension paa sakate hai
 Its manual states that the government will give its share in the same accounts which will not be income tax payers
 umr ke lihaaz se swaavlamban yojana 18 se 60 saal tak ke liye he or 52 saal kii umr tak isse jud sakate hai
 You cannot join the Atal Pension Scheme after 40 but after sixty you will get pension
 maine beemaa pension kshetra main jude ek vyakti se baat kii
 Keep in mind that with only one person, he said that under the Swavalamban scheme, 38 lakh accounts were opened, then the agent used to get 100 rupees commission on each account
 isse gaanvon main kuch logon ko kaam mil gaya
 All work in the Atal Pension Yojana will be done through the bank

 is model ko chunauti di james dadson ne
 When the company did not provide insurance cover to the 55-year-old mathematician, James and his colleagues challenged the insurance rules a lot
 james dadson ke nidhan ke baad unke ek shishy ne socity of equitable ashurence naam kii company banaai jahaan beemaa lene kii koi umr nahin thi
 He also made a table on the basis of how the insurance will be calculated, due to which the insurance industry has reached here today
 kya bharat sarkaar ne 1706 vaala model liya he
 Separate insurance for people aged 18 to 70, 18 to 50 years and pension scheme for 18 to 40 years
 atal pension yojana ko samajhane ke liye zaruri he ki isaki tulana pehle se chali aa rahi swaavlamban yojana se kii jaae jo asangathit kshetra main kaam karne vaale sabhi logon ke liye he
 For people aged 18 to sixty
 swaavlamban yojana main agar aap har saal 100 rupaya jamaa karenge to sarkaar har saal 200 degi yaa 500 denge to sarkaar 1000 jamaa karegi
 If you deposit 100 rupees in the Atal Pension Yojana, then the government will give 50 and if you give 500, the government will give 250
 adhiktam 1000 hi degi
 In both the schemes, the government will pay a maximum of Rs 1000 only
 maamla jatil he isliye kuch trutiyon ko maaf kijiega
 Under the Atal Pension Yojana, you can get a pension ranging from one thousand to five thousand by paying an annual installment of Rs 42 to 1452
 isaki niyamavali main likhaa he ki sarkaar unheen khaaton main apana hissaa degi jo iskar daata nahin honge
 In terms of age, the Swavalamban scheme is for 18 to 60 years and can be added till the age of 52 years
 atal pension yojana main 40 ke baad nahin jud sakate hai par saath ke baad pension milegi
 i spoke to a person involved in the insurance pension sector
 dhyaan rahe ki sirf ek vyakti se, unhone kaha ki swaavlamban yojana ke tahat 38 lakh khate khule to agent ko har khate par 100 rupaya kamishan miltaa tha
 This gave some people jobs in the villages
 atal pension yojana main sara kaam bank ke zariye hoga
 Is the infrastructure built by banks being used to support the insurance sector? usee agent ne kaha ki pichley bajet main vitt mantri arun jetali ne ek or acchhee yojana launch kii thi magar sarkaar uskaa kam prachaar kar rahi he
 The comments vriddhavastha pension yojana, ise atal bihari vaajapeyi ke samay shuru kiya gaya tha magar upie ne band kar diya
 Under this scheme, you can take insurance for families above sixty years by paying a lump sum
 kareeb 66 hazaar se chah lakh jamaa karne par agle saal se hi pension shuru ho jayega
 Under this, a pension of 500 to 5000 will be provided for life
 jiske naam se pension lenge uske nidhan ke baad puraa paisa nomini ke khate main aa jayega
 There is also a provision for income tax exemption on investment under this scheme
 yojana 15 agast tak ke liye he
 By the way if you open an account with a bank, you get an ATM card
 kai bank har atm card ke saath ek durghatana beemaa hota he jo bina premium ke miltaa he
 Accident insurance on debit and credit cards is also between five to fifteen lakhs
 state bank of india bachat khaataa dharakon ko salanaa 100 rupee ke premium par do lakh kaa durghatana beemaa detaa he
 So Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti, Suraksha Bima Yojana and Atal Pension Yojana
 pehle beemaa phir pension par baat

 The 15-month-old YSR Congress swept the Congress by sweeping 18 assembly seats and one Lok Sabha by-election in Andhra Pradesh, creating a 'jagan wave' in the state
 lahar bhi aisi ki har koi unki tulana anti rama raav se karne laga he jinhone 1982 main telugu desham party kaa gathan kar rajya main phir se raajnneeti kaa itihaas likhaa tha
 However, it would not be logical to see similarity between NTR and Jagan as both are different pillars from each other in every aspect
 wies jaganmohan reddy ko andhra pradesh main itnaa lokapriy bana dene kaa ek kaaran yah he ki unhone sonia gandhi kii khuleam avhelnaa kii
 He remained loyal to her (sonia) as far as she felt that this did not hurt her 'self-respect'
 jab bhi congress pramukh ne koi dakhal diya to unhone ise apane ‘nijee maamle’ main dakhal mana or iskaa virodh kiya
 The dramatic rise of Jagan has led to the decline of the Congress in the state
 varsh 2004 main agar congress andhra pradesh main satta main aane main safal rahi to yah ekmaatr keval rajasekhar reddy kii vajah se tha or isi shaks kii vajah se congress 2009 main lagaataar duusari baar satta main aa pai
 The Congress has never been able to deny it
 yah bhi ek doosraa kaaran he jisane jagan ke raajnneetik ubhaar main madad kii jo unke divangat pita kii viraasat par aadhaarit he
 The third factor that helped Jagan's rise was the 'credibility crisis' in which Telugu Desam Party chief n Chandrababu Naidu got stuck
 wiesar ke nidhan ke baad congress main netritv kaa khalipan 39 varshiya netaa ke liye sahi sabit hua jinka spasht lakshya mukhyamantri pad kii kursi he
 Jagan was successful in communicating with the common people
 yah samvaad mukhya rup se us saakh par aadhaarit tha jo unke divangat pita ne apane vibhinn ‘kalyankari’ kaaryakramon ke jariye banaayi thi
 He merely reminded the people of what his father had done for him as Chief Minister and promised him that he would continue the same
 paryvekshakon kaa kahana he, ‘logon ne unki baton ko gambhirtha se liya kyonki unka maananaa tha ki jagan bhi vah sabhi chijen lagu karne ke liye utane hi tatpar rahenge jitna unke pita the
 'those close to him say that there are definitely some negative things in him as well
 unka maananaa he, ‘vah apane pita ke bilkul hi vipareet hai jinamein ki kaaphi dayaa bhav tha
 Despite this, the biggest obstacle for Jagan to reach his goal (chief Minister's chair) is the Telangana issue
 vah nishchit rup se andhra roilseema kshetron main ek badi takat hai lekin telugana main nahin
 Unless the YSR Congress takes a clear stand on the issue of a separate state, Jagan may not be able to make inroads in the Telangana region and this could shock his chances

 justise chandrachud ne kaha ki isamen do tark ho sakate hai, awwal to nirjan pade jeern mandir kii jagah masjid banaai gai, yaa phir bilkul khaali jameen par banaai gai

 aroda ne kaha ki hinduon kaa daawa he ki maharaja vikramaditya ke samay ramajanm bhoomi mandir banaaya gaya tha
 It had statues of gods and goddesses on the stone pillars

 main bhi isamen nahin paduungi
 Justice Chandrachud asked what is the basis for not accepting the ASI report? Justice Bobde asked that there was also a tradition of renovation of temples
 puraane jeern mandiron ko usee sthaan par sire se banaaya jaataa he
 Is a mosque built on the site of a dilapidated temple? The Hindu side will have to tell that there was a temple there
 wo saboot den
 How can it be proved from the account of a traveler that someone had told him that there was a temple there

 We will see if there was any forward letter with the report
 ab aap aglaa point bataaen
 Meenakshi Arora said that the Hindu parties have not told who built the temple there and in what period? Vikramaditya was the title of many kings, so this claim is not solid

 The period of its construction is not as important
 minakshi aroda ne kaha ki vahaan khudaai kii jagah pashchimi chor par 50 meter lambii moti diwaar mili

 Justice Bhushan said that there is no mention of Idgah in your arguments, as Hindus have been giving pleading for a temple
 minakshi aroda ne kaha ki puraatatv report main kaha gaya he ki khambhe alag-alag samay ke hai
 Some are of 6AD and 7AD
 koi bada or chota tathaa alag-alag duuri par sthit hai
 In such a situation, the pillars that are being talked about after excavation were of the temple, it is not clear
 chif justise ne kaha ki aap jo bhi daleelein de raheen hai wo aapke daawey se sambandhit hai, kya inkaa auchity he? aroda ne kaha ki meraa taatpary yah he ki report sahi nahin he
