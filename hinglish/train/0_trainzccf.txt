 Matheesha Pathirana: Lasith Malinga is regarded as one of the best fast bowlers of all time, in other words, the legend of Sri Lankan cricket
 ajeebogareeb ection vaale malinga ko yorker or slor ball phenkane main gajab kii maharath hasil he
 Due to his bowling, Malinga has given many miraculous victories to Sri Lanka Cricket Team
 baharhaal malinga ab 36 varsh ke ho chuke hai, ve apane cricket kariyar ke antim padaav par hai
 In such a situation, the question is being raised in Sri Lankan cricket at this time, after Malinga? The answer seems to have been found in the form of 17-year-old Mathisa Patirana (matheesha Pathirana)
 khaas baat yah he ki malinga kii tarah patiranaa bhi slingi ection se bowling karte hai
 Looking for batsman at number 4 in Team India, Suresh Raina said, 'main Hoon Na' 17 year old Matheesha Pathirana from Kandy, Sri Lanka reminds us of someone

 In this sense, the initial words of Naipaul came towards me like a brick that broke the glass: "the world is what it is, men who are nothing, who allow themselves to be nothing, have no place in it

 Dalmia says, 'when the Lucknow Bench of the Allahabad High Court ruled in the year 2010 that there was a temple there first, then now the Supreme Court should only improve the High Court's decision to build a Ram temple on the entire land there Give directions viechpi ke purv adhyaksh kehete hai, jab court main pehle hi donon paksh aapasi sahmati se halafanama de chuke hai, to ab baatcheet kii koi zarurat nahin he
 The court and the government should proceed to build Ram temple on the basis of those affidavits
 daalamia saath hi kehete hai ki pradhanmantri narendra modi se poochna chahie ki vah ram mandir banane ke liye kadam kyon nahin badha rahe hai
 The BJP has an absolute majority government at the Center
 rajyasabha main agar BJP ke paas bahumat nahin hai, to uske liye bhi sarkaar ke paas vikalp hai
 The government can call a joint session of both houses of Parliament and pass a resolution to build a Ram temple
 daalamia ne yah bhi kaha ki ram mandir banane ke liye sarkaar main ichhashakti honi bahut zaruri he
 Nobody can do anything in the spirit of will
 unhone kaha ki agar ram mandir ko raajnneeti se dur rakhaa jaataa, to abhi tak ram mandir kaa nirmaan ho chukaa hota
 On the conspiracy case against various leaders of BJP and VHP in the Wahembabari demolition case, Dalmia says that the CBI gave a wrong affidavit in the court
 vah ham par bina sabooton ke aarope laga rahi he
 There none of us had provoked the people to demolish the Babri structure, instead we had appealed to all of them not to demolish the Babri Masjid

 pataa chalaa he ki aatanki airbase par hamalaa karne se 20 ghante pehle hi vahaan pahunch gaye the, lekin ve chhipe rahe
 The four terrorists who attacked at 3:30 in the morning of 2 January had reached there on the first of January itself, and had also left the car at 3 AM on the same day, from which they had come
 SP kii car airbase tak kaise ai?yah daawa angreji akhbaar indian express ne grih mantralay ke ek adhikari ke hawaale se kiya he
 It is interesting that Gurdaspur SP Salvinder's Mahindra XUV was found in unclaimed condition near the airbase at 11 am on January 1
 salwinder kaa daawa he ki unhen aatankiyon ne 31 disambar ko agava kar liya tha
 The NIA is also questioning him
 ab jaanch kaa ek angel yah bhigruh mantralay ke adhikari ne kaha ki 20 ghante tak chaar aatanki airbase ke paas chhipe rahe
 Investigating officers are now trying to find out where these terrorists are hiding and why they took so long to attack
 kyonki itani der tak airbase ke aasapaas chhupakar hamale kaa intjaar karne se to unke liye khatra bad hi rahaa tha
 Floodlight was not even working, it is not clear how the terrorists were able to enter the airbase
 jaanch main saamne aayaa he ki us raat airbase kii phlite bhi kaam nahin kar rahi thim
 His position was also upward, so that the boundary wall holder could not be seen from the watchtower

 dilli ke siem arvind kejariwal ke ghar ke baahar ghate ghatnakram ke baad mangalvaar ko dilli bijepi adhyaksh manoj tiwari ne siem kejariwal ko nai chunauti di he
 Manoj Tiwari has challenged Arvind Kejriwal to come to Ramlila Maidan and open debate
 tiwari ne kaha he ki agar ceiling ke masale par kejariwal vaaki sach bol rahe hai to wo ramlila maidan main aakar unase khule main bahes karen
 Let us tell you that on Tuesday, CM Kejriwal had alleged that BJP leaders are afraid to discuss in front of the media and hence went away without talking
 manoj tiwari ne kaha ki khulibahas ke liye ramlila maidanko unhone tay kiya he or ab arvind kejariwal bas taarikh or samay bataa den ki wo kab bahes karnaa chaahate hai
 Manoj Tiwari said that in spite of this, if Kejriwal does not want to come to Ramlila Maidan, then he should decide the place himself, also decide the time and date himself and come for the debate
 manoj tiwari ne aarope lagaaya ki kejariwal is maamle main bhi jhooth bol rahe hai ki emsidi ne sadakon kaa survey nahin kiya
 Tiwari said that if the MCD did not conduct the survey, then why did Kejriwal remember it when the delegation of BJP leaders went to meet him and why he had not done anything in this regard for the last 3 years
 dilli bijepi adhyaksh ne kaha ki ramlila maidan main janata ko bhi nyauta diya jayega or phir vahaan doodh kaa doodh or pani kaa pani ho jayega
 Manoj Tiwari said that he will take up the matter in Parliament to stop this incident of assault and sealing

 According to Tiwari, he has assured that soon he can take a big decision on the issue of sealing, but Manoj Tiwari did not tell what that decision will be
 tiwari ne bataaya ki agle ek yaa do din main bijepi netaa or meyar dilli ke uparajyapal se mulaakaat karne unke ghar jaaenge or ceiling ko rokane par charchaa karenge
 The proposal to create a second shelter for the Babur lions has pitted the BJP governments of Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh against each other
 abhi gujarat kaa gir abhayaarany babar sheron kaa ekmaatr thikaana he
 Gujarat does not want to create a new lion land by sending some lions from Gir in the kuno-palpur sanctuary near Gwalior in Madhya Pradesh
 bhartiya vanyajiwan santhaan (dablooiai) kii salaah par 1990 ke dashak main centre sarkaar ne sheron ke liye nayaa ashiana banane kaa faisla kiya tha
 The matter appeared before the Supreme Court on 1 May on a petition by the Biodiversity Conservation Trust, an NGO working for wildlife
 sunwaayee ke dauraan madhya pradesh sarkaar ne gujarat ke un aaropon ko bebuniyaad bataaya jinamein kaha gaya tha ki madhya pradesh ke van adhikari sheron kii dekhbhaal karne main sakasham nahin hai
 There is hunting in the area of madhya Pradesh and there is not enough space to hunt lions
 is bahes ko us vakt or hawa mil gai jab madhya pradesh paryaton vibhaag ne apni website par yah jaankaree post kii ki ''kuno ko un viluptpraaya babar sheron ke liye vaikalpik thikaane ke rup main chun liya gaya he jo abhi tak gujarat ke gir rashtriya abhayaarany main hi paae jate hai
 "the Gujarat government claims that it has taken adequate measures to protect the lions and it is non-essential for them to find another location
" gir main sheron kii sankhya badhkar 411 tak pahunch chuki he or rajya sarkaar apni greater gir avadharana ke tahat abhayaarany ke ghaas ke maidan main 400 varg kilometre or van kshetra main 1,400 varg kilometre tak kii badhotaree karne main kaamyaab hui he
 Gujarat forest officials also say that hunters active in Gir come from Katni in Madhya Pradesh, not far from kuno-palpur
 iskaa matlab yah he ki prastaavit doosraa thor sheron ke liye surakshit nahin he
 Pradeep Khanna, Principal Chief Conservator of Forests in Gujarat, says, "there is definitely no need to take lions out of Gujarat
" yah viluptpraaya prajati kahin or ke mukaable yahaan zyada surakshit he
 "but unlike them, Sartaj Singh, the Forest Minister of Madhya Pradesh, says," It would be wrong to say that the barber lions will not be safe in kuno-palpur
 madhya pradesh ne rajya main baaghon kii maujuudagi vaale anya rashtriya udyanon kaa behtareen prabandhan kiya he
 Gujarat should understand that for the good future of this species it is necessary to make a second shelter
 ''gujarat ke ek anya van adhikari yaad dilaate hai ki sheron ko kuno-palpur bhejne kii bhartiya vanyajiwan santhaan kii sifarish ek raajnneetik nirnay thi kyonki tab is sanstha main madhya pradesh ke adhikariyon kaa hi dabadabaa tha
 He said that the idea of a second hideout is superficial as the area of kuno-palpur is only 344 square kilometers and the recommendation was to transfer only six lions
 haalanki, e
 J
 tii
 Eminent wildlife experts like John Singh believe that it is necessary for the Babur lions to find a place other than Gir
 ve kehete hai, ''sheron ko bachaane ke liye gujarat sarkaar ke prayaason kii koi andekhi nahin kar saktaa, lekin prakruti kii anhoni kii koi seemaa nahin he
 In 1994, a quarter of the 4,000 lions found in Serengeti National Park in Tanzania were eradicated by a dog-borne epidemic
 serengeti to 30,000 varg kilometre tak failaa hua he jo ki gir ke mukaable kai guna he
 It is wise to find another place
 ''madhya pradesh sarkaar ne kuno-palpur abhayaarany main 700 varg kilometre kaa kshetra or joda he taaki vahaan zyada se zyada sheron ko rakhaa ja sake
 But this is the year of elections in Gujarat and Gujarati 'pride' is at stake, so the lions may have to wait longer for their new home

 haalanki varisht nagarikon ko kuch laabh mila he
 For example, the limit for tax free deposits has been increased, at which the rate of interest is 8 percent
 ab yah 7
 From 5 lakhs to 15 lakhs
 iskaa taatpary ye he ki byaaj se hone vaali salanaa aay main ab aap 60,000 rupee zyada jod paaenge
 For those who want to take insurance for their elderly parents, there is also a chance to celebrate
 sarkaar ab 50,000 tak ke premium par aapako ribet kaa laabh degi
 Earlier this limit was Rs 30,000
 yani ab aap salanaa 6000 rupee bachaa sakenge
 If you invest directly in equity or mutual funds, then you will have to pay long-term capital gains tax
 maan lijie aapane ek saal pehle kharide hue share ko bechakar 2 lakh rupee kaa laabh kamaaya
 In such a situation, now you have to give 10 percent to the government on the amount above 1 lakh
 yani 1 lakh kii raashi par 10 hajaar aapako sarkaar ko dena hoga
 Now the more profit you earn, the more the government will have to pay
 sarkaar ne ek choti si dayaa ye kii he ki agar aapane 31 janvari 2018 tak kuch laabh kamaaya he, to aapako koi tex nahin dena hoga
 Equity mutual funds also now have to pay 10 percent tax to the government, on the income they pay to you
 yani ek or jhatka
 But what about indirect tax? Will your expenses be reduced by that? dukh ke saath kahana pad rahaa he ki nahin, aisa nahin hoga
 The government has imposed a surcharge of 10 per cent on customs duty, meaning imported goods will now be more expensive
 aise main aipal phone kii keemat 5000 rupee tak bad sakati he, to 9
 Hyundai Creta prices of Rs 3 lakh can see a jump of Rs 70,000, while Audi R8 can be expensive up to Rs 10 lakh

 If you do not believe in reincarnation, then read Nokia's story - will be sure
 nokia ek samay duniya ke sabase bharosemand brands main se gina jaataa tha
 But when the days got worse, the situation became such that the company was left bankrupt
 company ne hajaaron logon ko naukari se nikaal diya, tamaam sanmpati bikati gayi or phir ek din aisa aayaa ki puri company hi bik gayi, kharida Microsoft ne
 It was being said that Nokia is now buried and it is difficult to return
 lekin windos kii naav par baithkar nokia laut aayaa he
 This debate is so old that if Nokia had taken over Android in time, then brands like Samsung, HTC, Micromax would not exist in the mobile market
 ye kahani bhi badi dilachsap he ki kis tarah Microsoft ne nokia company ko saste main kharidne ke liye pehle ek sajeesh ke tahat barbaad kiya
 But today we tell you rather than the story of Nokia Company that Nokia's phone phones - called Nokia Lumia - should be bought or not
 kehane ko to windos phone achatisi or sanmsang jaisi kuch or companiyaan bhi banaati hai
 But now Nokia Lumia coin runs in the world of Windows Phone
 isliye ham sirf usee kii baat karenge
 Windows Phone means Nokia Lumia
 windos phone hi khariden agar-1
 You want to stand out from the crowd
 Everyone has an Android or Blackberry phone in their hands
 appal bhi ab bharat main iphone 4 jaise outdated modells ko saste main bech kar bazaar par chaa janaa chahta he
 In such a situation, Nokia Lumia's very beautiful phones give you a different identity
 mobile phone se hamaara parichay hi nokia ne karaayaa tha
 Therefore, no one can compete with this in terms of trust
 sundar or solid- donon khaasiyat chahie to nokia lumia ke phone ko ek baar jarur dekhen
 Have you noticed that most people using Nokia Lumia keep it without phone cover
 jabaki duusare phone kharidne vaale mobile kharidne ke saath hi use mobile cover ke bheetar chhipate hai
 Because people who have used Nokia's phone even once, they know that toy plastic-like phones can not stand in front of it in terms of strength
 lekin taff hone ke saath hi nokia lumia ke phone makkhan kii tarah smooth chalate hai
 2
 behad khubasurat 'tiles kaa jaadu' chaahate hampsand apni-apni ho sakati he, lekin is baat se koi inkaar nahin kar saktaa ki windos phone ke pal-pal badalane vaale tiles kamaal ke dikhte hai
 'live tiles' and 'hub' are the lives of Windows Phone
 tiles, windos phone kii home screen par dikhne vaale wo rangabirangi chaukor jagah hai jahaan tamaam jaankaree, photo, khud ba khud, live apadet hote rahete hai
 There is no need to open different applications for this
 chaahe wo missed call ho, SMS ho yaa phir mausam kaa haal- tiles sab kuch fouran aapke saamne pesh karata rahata he
 Similarly, the Hub has also been created so that instead of searching all the things you want, you can find them directly together, in one place - whether it is inside your phone or online
 'tiles' or 'hub' kitne shandaar dikhte hai iskaa andaja aap is baat se laga sakate hai ki andrid phone main isaki nakal par banaae gaye ap ko lakhon log downlod kar chuke hai taaki unka phone dikhne main windos jaisaa lage
 3
 acchhee betry life or camera chaahate hansmart phone ke saath sabase badi musiibat uski betry hi he
 No matter how expensive the phone is, the cry of the battery remains
 nokia lumia ke phone is maamle main behatar hai
 Actually, Windows software is designed in such a way that it consumes less power to do any work than other phones
 isi tarah, acchhee photo ke liye aap nokia phone ke camere par aankh moond kar bharosa kar sakate hai- kam lite main bhi
 In case of phone camera, Nokia Lumia 1020 will not be wrong if it is called the father of other phones
 41 megapixl censor, Carl Zeiss Lens, 6 lens kaa bana camera or kai aisi khubiyaan- jise sunakar duusare phone panaah mangane lagenge
 Nokia Lumia of about 44 thousand is for the photography enthusiasts but even the cameras of other phones of Lumia will not disappoint you

 Dealing with office work over the phone The Windows software that runs Honokia Lumia is made by the same Microsoft company that maintains office work worldwide on Microsoft Office
 jaahir si baat he, aapke compauter par chalane vaale Mircrosoft ke tamaam aplikations ke saath windos phone kii jaisi dosti hogi waisi koi or phone main ho hi nahin sakati
 In the case of search, the power that Google has is the same with Mircrosoft in terms of office applications
 or nokia lumia ke maamle main to ab phone ke software se lekar hardware tak sabaki maalik ek hi company he
 Therefore, the incomplete work left on the office computer is the easiest to complete on Windows Phone
 yahi nahin, security ke maamle main windos phone andrid ke mukaable bahut behatar hai
 It is said that the biggest hangout of phone viruses and malware is the Android Play Store
 agar baat map kii karen to nokia kaa 'here' map kamaal kaa he or sabase badi baat ki ye ofline yani bina internet ke bhi bakhubi kaam karata he
 5
 kam kharch main smart phone kaa majaa chaahate hanaisa nahin ki nokia lumia ke phone saste hai
 But it can be said with certainty that there is nothing better than Nokia Lumia if you want to buy a low-cost smart phone
 isaki kai vajah he
 The first thing is that in low-cost Android phones, you will often get the old version of the software and you will feel outdated as soon as you buy the phone
 kam keemat vaale kisi bhi andrid kaa letest varjan kitcat 4
 4
 2 shaayad hi mili
 But Nokia Lumia is excellent in this case
 8,000 rupee ke lumia 520 main bhi vahi Windows 8 chal rahaa he jo 44 hajaar ke lumia 1020 main
 The second thing is that to run an engine called Android, more power, more power is required
 kam keemat vaale andrid kaa sasta procesar, kamjor betry ke dam par phone chalata to he lekin dhakke markar
 In the case of Windows, the gap between poverty and poverty is less known
 lekin windos phone kharidne se pehle ye bhi jaan len-1
 Some people will have to learn how to operate the phone
 Some people may get angry that even for doing a minor job in Nokia Lumia phone, they have to do a lot of work
 jaise vaai faai, flite mod or bluetooth on-of karne ke liye bhi na to screen par koi drop-down minu he or na hi koi doosraa shortkat
 Keep searching inside the settings! If you give a new man to take a picture, then only the button will be kept searching
 ek hi home screen he jis par tiles ke saath her-pher karne ke alaava apni marji kaa zyada kuch nahin kar sakate
 There is also no shortcut for the lock screen
 or phone main file manager bananaa kyon bhul gaye bill gates ankal? phone kii files dekhne ke liye bhi har baar phone ko compauter se jodna pade, to ye kahaan kii aklmandi he?2
 The world of apps is spoiled here
 That is where Windows Phone gets badly beaten up
 jis kaam ke liye duusare phones par ek se ek ap muft maujuud hai uske liye windos par koi eps he hi nahin
 To say, there are thousands of apps for Windows Phone too
 lekin yphone or andrid ke mukaable windos phone main eps kii duniya main garibi chai he
 If you like things like Candy Crush and Temple Run, then Windows Phone is not a very good choice
 512 MB RAM ab andrid kii duniya main shame kii baat maani jaati he, lekin nokia lumia ise dhadlle se chalaa rahaa he jo kai games khilne ke kaaphi nahin he
 Surprisingly, there is no style app for youtube as well
 agar website par jaakar hi you-tub bhi dekhnaa he to kya phayda smart phone kaa? jo ap hai bhi, unki quality yphone or andrid ke mukaable kii nahin he
 3
 windos se dosti matlab google se bairye to aapako pataa hi he ki andrid google kii santan he
 So why would Google want someone to stand up against their child? isliye google ke diwane hai to windos phone par ye ehsaas aapako hameshaa hoga ki aapke saath sautela vyavhaar ho rahaa ho
 Windows Phone would like you to use Bing instead of Google for search
 Bing kii photo bhale laajawab ho, search main wo google se muqabla nahin kar saktaa
 Whether Google Map, Google Now, Youtube or Gmail - Google's crazy world, then it would be better to go to the shelter of Google's phone - buy Windows Phone, then understand it
 4
 Finding which message came where - people may find the system of notifications in Windows Phone confusing
 tiles main jaankaree apadet hona dekhne main stylish to lagata he lekin suvidhajanak nahin he
 In Android, you can choose a different notification sound for all kinds of notifications - like Facebook updates, Twitter, Whatsapp, so that the message can be understood by voice only on Facebook or Twitter
 windos main ye sambhav nahin he
 That is why many people find it difficult to use Nokia Lumia all the time
 gaanaa sunne kaa wolum kam kiya, to ringtone bhi dhimi ho jaaegi
 What happened, brother! 5
 video kaa majaa kuch kam he yahanvidio kii itani tarah kii files hoti hai
 That it is difficult for any phone to operate
 lekin windos phone main ye dikkat sabase zyada aegi
 It is not enough for Windows Phone to be able to play many types of video files
 na to windos phone flash player ko saport karte hai or na hi video play karne ke liye ap store main koi badhiya ap uplabdh he
 Not only this, it is also difficult to share videos with Bluetooth in Windows Phone

 a strange marriage took place in Baghdol Gram Panchayat in Jashpur
 ek siarpief jawan ne ek hi mandap par do shaadiyaan kin
 In this marriage together, one girl was the girlfriend of the young man and the other was his wife
 iskaa matlab he ki siarpief jawan ne patni or garlfriend ke saath shaadi kii
 CRPF jawan Anil Pakhara is a resident of Jashpur and his job is in Varanasi
 shaadi ke liye wo gaanv aae the
 Four years ago, he was married to a woman from a neighboring village
 jiske baad unako anganwari varkar se pyaar kar baithe
 According to the rules, it is considered a misconduct for a government employee to get married while married
 newindianexpress se baat karte hue siarpief ke spokeperson ne kaha- ye rules baar ke khilaaf he
 No employee can have two marriages
 anil pakhra pareshaani main aa saktaa he
 Sarpanch of Baghdol Gram Panchayat Lalit Nagesh said- 'for the first time in my own life, i have witnessed a marriage where a man made 7 rounds with two women simultaneously
 ho saktaa he ki shaks ne duusari patni par apni ichha puri karne kaa dabaav daalaa hoga
 Because he was not having a child with his first wife
 ' unki shaadi puure reeti rivaaj se hui
 The villagers believe that he had a relationship with the Anganwadi worker
 isliye usne duusari shaadi kii he
 Journalist Rajesh Pandey from Jashpur told- 'whenever Anil used to come to the village on holidays, he used to stay with Anganwadi worker more than his wife
 uski patni ko bhi is baat kaa pataa tha
 She agreed to the second marriage and the CRPF jawan married the Anganwadi worker
 ' Unscrupulous miscreants in Greater Noida, Uttar Pradesh, carried out the robbery by holding the car-ridden family hostage

 10 maheene pehle jaisi ghatana purv siem mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ke kaarykaal main hui, waisi hi ghatana ab yogi raaj main anjaam di gai
 In such a situation, the question is whether the situation has not changed even after changing the government in UP? On the question of law and order in UP, the BJP surrounded the Akhilesh government of the Samajwadi Party in the UP assembly election campaign
 bijepi pravaktaa akhilesh sarkaar ke dangon kii sankhya ginate rahe
 From PM Modi to party president Amit Shah called the police stations as the office of Samajwadi Party leaders
 ab upi main bijepi kii sarkaar he
 The fire brand is headed by the leader Yogi Adityanathsube

 But the ground reality appears to be weakening their claims
 hatyaon kii ghatnayogi adityanath ke siem banane ke baad hi elahabaad main bispi netaa kii hatya kar di gai
 Recently, a case of murder of Samajwadi Party leader in Ballia also came up
 mathura main sarrapha vyapaariyon kii hatya or lutpaat kii ghatana ne bhi prashasnic sakriyata par sawalia nishaan lagaae
 Apart from these, cases of assault and murder also came up in the name of cow protection

 The mob was also accused of breaking the name plate of the SSP
 yani police ko bhi nishaanaa banaaya gaya
 Now the incident of loot and murder on Bulandshahar Road in Jewar, Greater Noida again raised questions on law and order in the Yogi government
 guuruuvaar raat ye parivaar car se bulandshahr ja rahaa tha, tabhi unhen bandhak bana liya gaya
 After the robbery, the miscreants also gang-raped the women sitting in the car
 itnaa hi nahin jab unke saath maujuud ek shaks ne badmaashon kaa virodh kiya to uski hatya kar di gai
 The incident which took place 10 months ago in Bulandshahr in Akhilesh government, happened with a family now going to Bulandshahr in Yogi government

 But this bill got stuck due to the opposition of the leaders of sports organizations
 khel mantri ajay maakan kehete hai, ‘cabinet main jo hua us par main tippanee karnaa nahin chahta, lekin khel mantralay kaa rukh saafe he
 By no means do we try to screw up sports organizations
 ham khel sanghathanon ke management main apana pratinidhi bhi nahin rakhana chaahate
 Nor are we instructing them to give any position to Ajay Maken or other mps or ministers
 ham sirf itnaa chaahate hai ki unke kaam-kaaj main puri paardarshita ho
 We want to ask them that if they send their team outside the country, are they not accountable to the whole country
 ham chaahate hai ki artiai ke zarie unke bahi-khaate janata kii pahunch main rahen

 Priyanka Gandhi Vadra was the reason behind this
 priyanka gandhi kii badali hui nai hair style hoobahu indira gandhi kii tarah najar aa rahi he
 On the occasion of the 66th birth anniversary of former Prime Minister of India, Rajiv Gandhi, the entire Gandhi family was present at the Virbhoomi to pay homage
 sonia bhi thim, rahul bhi the or rajeev kii bitiyaa priyanka gandhi bhi thim
 But Priyanka Gandhi looked somewhat changed
 badlaav aayaa he priyanka ke baalo main
 Priyanka's hairstyle has changed, Priyanka's hair style has changed priyanka ke is nae hair style ko dekhakar logon ko nishchit rup se indira gandhi kii yaad aa jaaegi
 Priyanka Gandhi looks exactly the same as grandmother Indira Gandhi looked like years ago
 priyanka ne apane baalo kii lambaai pehle se thodi or badhaayi he
 Priyanka Gandhi's hair used to be slightly shorter earlier but now her hairstyle has changed
 vaise bhi priyanka kaa style badale or unki tulana indira gandhi se na ho ye bhala kaise ho saktaa he
 People see him as he once saw Indira Gandhi
 jab bhi saarvajanik maukey par priyanka gandhi najar aati he to libaas ke taur par dikhti he salike se pahani hui sari
 On the other hand, Indira Gandhi's favorite dress was also a sari
 indira ko satta or siyasat main logon ne hameshaa ek hi style main dekha
 Short cut hair, garland of Rudraksha around the neck, white dial watch and saree
 kam se kam hair style or sari ke maamle main to priyanka apni daadi ke nakshekadam par hi chalati nazar aati hai
 Although Priyanka is sometimes seen in western clothes too, the direct answer is that there is a difference of two generations between Indira and Priyanka
 haalanki puraani peedi ke logon ko priyanka gandhi main apni role model indira gandhi dikhti hai, to nai peedi ko priyanka main nazar aata he aatmavishvaas se bharaa ikkisvin sadi kaa cheharaa
 And now after hairstyles like Hubuhu Indira, people must surely be remembering Rajira Gandhi as well as Indira
 aisa nahin he ki pehali baar potee priyanka or daadi indira ke bich samanta najar aa rahi he
 Even before, Priyanka's face, Priyanka's style and Priyanka's dress are reminded of Indira
 khud priyanka ne bhi kaha he ki unki naak to bilkul daadi indira kii tarah hi najar aati he
 People miss Indira not only in Priyanka's dress but also in her style of speaking and her speech

 The Supreme Court has asked the Central Government to reply to the decision of imposing President's rule in Uttarakhand

 The case will be next heard on May 3
 supreme court ne is maamle par centre sesat sawalbhi puche hai
 The Court raised the question on the Governor's decision that the Governor had sent a message to stop the floor test under Article 175 (2)? And can the governor do this? In the case of disqualification of 9 mlas in the state assembly, the court asked whether it is right to disqualify the members of the assembly
 And at what stage is the Appropriation Bill and what does the President have to say on this? Delay in floor test is not the basis of President's rule
 The court also questioned whether the delay in floor test can be the basis for imposition of President's rule? Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi said in court that if the money bill was passed on March 18, then why was it not sent to the Governor
 27 march ko kyon bheja gaya ? is par harish ravat or congress ke vakil abhishek manu singhvi ne kaha ki kya mani bill governor ke paas bhejne main deree raashtrapati shashan kaa aadhaar ho saktaa he?dilli kaise tay karegi rajya main bill paas hua yaa nahinsinghvi ne kaha ki yah maan bhi liya jaae ki sting oparation sahi he to bhi ye raashtrapati shashan kaa aadhaar nahin ho saktaa

 The Supreme Court asked whether the cm's sting could be considered as a relay material for imposing President's rule
 The court said that TV sting may be wrong on social or moral grounds, but how can it be the basis of imposing President's rule? The court asked whether Sting can also be made the basis of President's rule
 If there was any doubt about the passing of the money bill, then everything would have become clear in the floor test on 28 March

 The Congress BJP has learned from its experiences
 sipiem netaa seetaram yechuri ne aadhaar bill ko mani bill ke rup main pesh karne par sawaal uthaaya
 Said that a bench of five judges of the Supreme Court is considering in this matter
 bill laane kii jaldi kya thi
 The authority of Rajya Sabha has been challenged by giving form of money bill
 vitt mantri ne kaha ki tab bhi jabaki maamla adaalat main he, sansad ke paas kanoon banane ke adhikaar surakshit hai
 If the money belongs to the treasury of India then it can be a money bill
 sawaal zarur uthe magar sawaal ko sweekaar nahin kiya gaya
 The debate took place in the form of a money bill
 mani bill ke tahat rajyasabha kisi bill main sanshodhan suza sakati he magar 14 din se zyada roak nahin sakati
 It will be considered a pass
 magar aaj vipaksh ne apane etraazon se sarkaar ko aise gheraa ki kai sanshodhano ko sweekaar karnaa pad gaya or bill ko phir se paas hone ke liye loksabhaa main bheja gaya
 Apart from Yechury, Jairam Ramesh of Congress also raised many questions on the Aadhaar bill
 jairam ramesh bhi mani bill vaale pahalu par kaaphi research karke aae the
 What he said also helps us understand how much an MP can enrich the House with his knowledge and how hard he works for that information
 vitt mantri jetali ne 5 march ko loksabhaa main congress par palatwaar karte hue kaha tha ki unki sarkaar main bhi 1986 kaa juvenil justise bill or 1983 kaa african deveopment bank bill mani bill ke rup main pesh kiya gaya tha
 Jairam Ramesh told that he went to the Library of Parliament to check it
 500 pannon kii report padhi
 Both also went to the officers associated with the bill
 rajyasabha sachivalay se poocha ki kya ye mani bill he yaa nahin
 Both were not money bills
 ye ek note mujhe rajyasabha sachivalay se mila he lekin main chahta hum ki sadan ke netaa bataayen ki ye jaankaree kya menuphacture hui ki donon mani bill the
 Jaitley had to answer that he got this information from the Lok Sabha website
 rajyasabha ke up sabhapati pi
 J
 courion ne kaha ki ye data entry kaa masalaa ho saktaa he
 It will be dealt separately in the House
 jis data par ham itnaa bharosa kar rahe hai uske entry ko lekar galati ho sakati he, wo bhi usee sadan kii website par jahaan khadey hokar sarkaar aashwaasan de rahi he ki aadhaar card ke liye jamaa kii gai jaankariyaan li nahin ho saktin
 But why did the mps of Lok Sabha not work as hard as Jairam Ramesh did
 scrol news site ke anusaar loksabhaa main jab aadhaar bill 2016 main pesh kiya gaya to uske paas karne ke vakt 545 main se 73 saansad hi sadan main maujuud the
 The government does not have a majority in the Rajya Sabha, but there is a lot of confusion surrounding the provisions of this bill
 jairam ne kai sawaal uthaae jinhen sanshodhano ke taur par unhone rajyasabha se paas bhi karavaaya
 For example, biometric information, core biometric information and demographic information should be closely interpreted in the bill itself so that later they cannot be interpreted arbitrarily in the form of rules
 aadhaar skim main shaamil vyakti ko usase baahar nikalne kaa vikalp mili or iske baad usase judi sabhi jaankariyaan nasht kar di jaaen
 Authority should also give its certificate
 aadhaar ko aichhik hi hona chahie, anivaary nahin kiya janaa chahie
 The person who does not want to be a part of Aadhaar should be given other options to get government facilities and subsidies
 rashtriya suraksha bada hi vyapak or dhilaa dhaala shabd he, uski jagah public immergency shabd rakhaa jaae jaisaa ki indian telegraph act main he
 The Aadhaar bill was passed without amendment in the Lok Sabha
 rajyasabha main jairam ramesh ke chaar sanshodhan sadan main paas ho gaye kyonki yahaan bahumat vipaksh ke paas he
 Experts of parliamentary strategy believe that this is nothing short of an embarrassment for any government
 vaise sarkaar rajyasabha main paas hue sanshodhano ko sweekaar karne ke liye baadhya nahin he magar niyamon ke tahat ise waapas loksabhaa main paas karana hoga
 The Finance Minister has said that the possibility of breach of personal privacy under this bill is not correct
 aadhaar kaa data rashtriya suraksha ke alaava kisi bhi haal main saajha nahin kiya jayega
 Is a short story
 mujhe pataa nahin aadhaar ke vivaad ko samajhane main madad karti he yaa nahin lekin saajha kar saktaa hum
 This story does not have an Aadhaar number nor does it have any biometric
 1906 main dakshin africa main ek kanoon aayaa tha ki sabhi asian purush ko register karana hoga or maangane par ek pahchaan patr dikhaanaa hoga jis par uske anguuthe ke nishaan honge
 Whoever does not have this will be sent back to where the ship came from
 iske khilaaf gandhi ne jansabha bulaakar is kanoon ko kaala kanoon ghoshit kar maanane se inkaar kar diya
 i am not in a position to say that Gandhi has opposed the entire law even with thumb impression
 lekin vitt mantri ne america kaa udhaaharan diya ki 1935 main hi america ne soshal security number bana liya tha
 We are 80 years behind
 america america main ise kai baar chalange kiya gaya
 Required for income tax, many policies and economic activities, it was compulsory to keep arms
 isane unki neshnal security main unhen madad kii
 It was challenged continuously and in every case their courts said that National Security is the right reason
 america ke soshal security number or bharat ke aadhaar number main ek buniyadi fark ye he ki soshal security number ke liye biometric pahchaan nahin lee jaati he
 That is, your fingerprints, iris is not scanned
 aadhaar ko lekar vivaad kaa bada hissaa biometric pahchaan ko lekar bhi he
 If the social security number had arrived in the US in 1935, then why did Aadhaar not come in that country or why biometric identification was not added to the social security number
 jabaki sapanom ke us mulk main bhi garib hai or sarkaar unhen sabsidi detii he
 i spoke to an MLA who has been involved in the process of making Aadhaar cards
 unhone kaha ki kai auraton ke kaam karte karte or bartan maanjte maanjte ungaliyon ke por ghis jate hai
 There is difficulty in taking biometric marks of such women
 biometric banane ke baad aage chalakar jab ungaliyon ke por ghis jate hai tab uske saath kya hoga
 Will she be returned from the ration shop
 yahi dikkat purush mazaduron ke saath bhi aati he
 Many times finger tips of the elderly are not found
 motiyobind ke kaaran bhi putliyon ke nishaan kaa milan mushkil hota he
 Cataract surgery in many states of the country leads to loss of eyesight
 agar ham anivaary rup se aadhaar par nirbhar rahenge to aisi paristhiti main kya hoga
 Sometimes, the quality of the machines also makes a big difference
 bijedy saansad ne kaha ki sansad main hi kai baar biometric thik se kaam nahin karata he
 However, in many places biometric machines do not work in between
 agar isaki vajah se kisi garib ko usee din rashan nahin mila to uske saath kya hoga
 One question is the breach of privacy
 ek sawaal he aadhaar ke tahat jamaa jaankaree ko surakshit rakhane kaa
 It is absolutely yesterday that Bangladesh's foreign exchange reserves were hacked and $ 100 million was blown
 vahaan ke kendriya bank ke garvanar ko istipha dena padaa he
 In June 2013, Britain's Guardian newspaper Snowden was quoted as saying how the US National Security Agency spies more than one billion citizens of its own and dozens of countries
 unki internet or telephone kii gatividhiyon par nazar rakh rahi he
 Some time back Sony Picture's computer system was attacked by hackers
 china bhi site hack kar letaa he
 Cyber warfare is a reality
 aise main itnaa bada data surakshit hi he iskaa daawa ham kaise kar sakate hai
 In March 2015, the government told Parliament that more than 700 government websites have been hacked from 2012 to March 2015, but they did not contain any sensitive information
 sarkaar ke guideline ke anusaar samvedansheel jaankaree vaale sarkari computer baaki system se alag hai
 The comments news site scrol daat in par ushaa ranganathan ne likhaa he ki kuch din pehle radio par ek vigyaapan suna
 a company is claiming that it is India's first Aadhaar-based mobile app that verifies the identity of people working in your home such as driver, teacher, tenant
 ushaa ranganathan chetavanee de rahi hai ki agar ek privet company aisa kar sakati he to aap yah sochiye ki companiyaan aapke aadhaar kii soochna kaa apane hit main kis tarah se istemaal kar sakati hai
 So we will debate on security and privacy even today
 prime time main
 CPM leader Sitaram Yechury questioned the introduction of the Aadhaar bill as a money bill
 kaha ki is maamle main supreme court kii paanch jajon kii bench vichaar kar rahi he
 What was the hurry to bring the bill? mani bill kaa rup dekar rajyasabha ke adhikaar ko chunauti di gai he
 The Finance Minister said that even when the matter is in court, Parliament reserves the right to make laws
 agar paisa bharat ke rajkosh se sambandhit he to wo mani bill ho saktaa he
 The question definitely arose but the question was not accepted
 bahes mani bill ke rup main hi hui
 Under the Money Bill, the Rajya Sabha can suggest amendments to a bill but cannot stop it for more than 14 days
 ise paas maan liya jayega
 But today the opposition, with its objections, surrounded the government in such a way that many amendments had to be accepted and the bill was sent to the Lok Sabha to be passed again
 yechuri ke alaava congress ke jairam ramesh ne bhi aadhaar bill par kai sawaal khadey kiye
 Jairam Ramesh also came after doing a lot of research on the money bill aspect
 unhone jo kaha wo hamen yah bhi samajhane main madad karata he ki ek saansad apni jaankaree se sadan ko kitna samrudh kar saktaa he or us jaankaree ke liye wo kitni mehnat karata he
 On March 5, Finance Minister Jaitley countered the Congress in the Lok Sabha, saying that in his government, the Juvenile Justice Bill of 1986 and the African Development Bank Bill of 1983 were introduced as Money Bill
 jairam ramesh ne bataaya ki ise check karne ke liye ve sansad kii librari main gaye
 Read the 500-page report
 donon bill se jude afasaron ke paas bhi gaye
 Asked the Rajya Sabha Secretariat whether it was a money bill or not
 donon hi mani bill nahin the
 i have received this note from the Rajya Sabha Secretariat, but i want the Leader of the House to tell what information was manufactured that both were money bills
 jetali ko jawaab dena pad gaya ki unhen ye jaankaree loksabhaa kii website se mili he
 Rajya Sabha Deputy Chairman P
 je
 Kurien said that it could be a data entry issue
 ise sadan main alag se niptaya jayega
 There may be a mistake regarding the entry of the data on which we are so trusting, that too on the website of the same house where the government is assuring that the information submitted for the Aadhar card cannot be leaked
 lekin loksabhaa ke saansadon ne jairam ramesh kii tarah mehnat kyon nahin kii
 According to the Scroll News site, when the Aadhaar bill was introduced in the Lok Sabha in 2016, only 73 out of 545 mps were present in the House when it passed it
 rajyasabha main sarkaar ke paas bahumat nahin he lekin vahaan is bill ke praavdhaanon ko lekar khub gheraa ghaari hui
 Jairam raised many questions, which he also got passed by the Rajya Sabha as amendments
 jaise biomitric jaankaree, kor biomitric jaankaree or demographic jaankaree kii bill main hi baariki se vyakhya kii jaae taaki baad main unki vyakhya niyamon kii shakl main manamaane tareeke se naa kii ja sake
 The person involved in the Aadhaar scheme should get the option to exit from it and after that all the information related to it should be destroyed
 athurity iskaa certificket bhi de
 Aadhaar should be optional, not mandatory
 jo vyakti aadhaar kaa hissaa nahin bananaa chahta use sarkari suvidhaayen or sabsidi hasil karne ke liye duusare vikalp die jane chahie
 National security is a very broad and loosely worded word, instead of the word public emergency, as in the Indian Telegraph Act
 loksabhaa main aadhaar bill bina sanshodhan ke paas hua tha
 In the Rajya Sabha, four amendments of Jairam Ramesh passed in the House as the majority here is with the opposition
 sansadeey ranneeti ke jaankaar maanate hai ki aisa hona kisi bhi sarkaar ke liye sharmindagi se kam nahin he
 Although the government is not obliged to accept the amendments passed in the Rajya Sabha, but under the rules it will have to be passed back in the Lok Sabha
 vitt mantri ne kaha he ki is bill ke tahat vyaktigat gopneeyata ke bhang hone kii ashanka sahi nahin he
 Aadhaar data will not be shared under any circumstances other than national security
 ek choti si kahani he
 i do not know whether it helps to understand the dispute of Aadhaar but can share
 is kahani kaa koi aadhaar number nahin he or na hi iskaa kisi ke paas biometric he
 In 1906, a law was introduced in South Africa that all Asian men would have to register and show an identity card on which they would have thumb prints
 jiske paas aisa nahin he to use waapas jahaaz se vahaan bhej diya jayega jahaan se aayaa he
 Gandhi called a public meeting against this and refused to accept this law as a black law
 gandhi ne puure kanoon kaa virodh karte hue anguuthe ke nishaan ko lekar bhi virodh kiya yah abhi bataane kii sthiti main nahin hum
 But the Finance Minister gave the example of America that it was only in 1935 that America made Social Security number
 ham 80 saal peeche hai
 It was challenged several times in America
 inakam tex ke liye zaruri kiya, kai nitiyon or aarthik gatividhiyon, hathiyaar rakhane ke liye ise compalsri kiya gaya
 This helped him in his National Security
 ise lagaataar chalange diya gaya or har maamle main unki adaalaton ne kaha ki neshnal security ek sahi vajah he
 a fundamental difference between the US Social Security Number and India's Aadhaar Number is that biometric identification is not used for Social Security Number
 arthath aapaki ungaliyon ke nishaan, ankhon kii putali kaa scan nahin kiya jaataa he
 a large part of the controversy over Aadhaar is also about biometric identification
 agar america main 1935 main soshal security number aa gaya tha to us desh main aadhaar kyon nahin aayaa yaa soshal security number main biometric pahchaan kyon nahin jod di gai
 Whereas in that country of dreams are also poor and the government subsidizes them
 maine ek vidhayak ji se baat kii jo aadhaar card banavaane kii prakriya se jude rahe hai
 He said that while working for many women and the utensils are worn, the knuckles are worn out
 aisi mahilaon ke biometric nishaan lene main dikkat aati he
 After becoming biometric, what will happen to the fingers when fingers are worn out later
 kya wo rashan kii dukaan se lautaa di jaaegi
 The same problem also comes with male laborers
 kai baar bujurgon kii ungaliyon kii por ke nishaan milte hi nahin hai
 Due to cataract, it is difficult to match the mark of pupils
 desh ke kai rajyon main motiyobind ke oparation ke baad ankhon kii roshni chali jaati he

 yechuri ke alaava congress ke jairam ramesh ne bhi aadhaar bill par kai sawaal khadey kiye
 Jairam Ramesh also came after doing a lot of research on the money bill aspect
 unhone jo kaha wo hamen yah bhi samajhane main madad karata he ki ek saansad apni jaankaree se sadan ko kitna samrudh kar saktaa he or us jaankaree ke liye wo kitni mehnat karata he
 On March 5, Finance Minister Jaitley countered the Congress in the Lok Sabha, saying that in his government, the Juvenile Justice Bill of 1986 and the African Development Bank Bill of 1983 were introduced as Money Bill
 jairam ramesh ne bataaya ki ise check karne ke liye ve sansad kii librari main gaye
 Read the 500-page report
 donon bill se jude afasaron ke paas bhi gaye
 Asked the Rajya Sabha Secretariat whether it was a money bill or not
 donon hi mani bill nahin the
 a note from the Rajya Sabha Secretariat, but i want the Leader of the House to tell what information was manufactured that both were money bills
 jetali ko jawaab dena pad gaya ki unhen ye jaankaree loksabhaa kii website se mili he
 Rajya Sabha Deputy Chairman P
 je
 Kurien said that it could be a data entry issue
 ise sadan main alag se niptaya jayega
 There may be a mistake regarding the entry of the data on which we are so trusting, that too on the website of the same house where the government is assuring that the information submitted for the Aadhar card cannot be leaked
 lekin loksabhaa ke saansadon ne jairam ramesh kii tarah mehnat kyon nahin kii
 According to the Scroll News site, when the Aadhaar bill was introduced in the Lok Sabha in 2016, only 73 out of 545 mps were present in the House when it passed it
 rajyasabha main sarkaar ke paas bahumat nahin he lekin vahaan is bill ke praavdhaanon ko lekar khub gheraa ghaari hui
 Jairam raised many questions, which he also got passed by the Rajya Sabha as amendments
 jaise biomitric jaankaree, kor biomitric jaankaree or demographic jaankaree kii bill main hi baariki se vyakhya kii jaae taaki baad main unki vyakhya niyamon kii shakl main manamaane tareeke se naa kii ja sake
 The person involved in the Aadhaar scheme should get the option to exit from it and after that all the information related to it should be destroyed
 athurity iskaa certificket bhi de
 Aadhaar should be optional, not mandatory
 jo vyakti aadhaar kaa hissaa nahin bananaa chahta use sarkari suvidhaayen or sabsidi hasil karne ke liye duusare vikalp die jane chahie
 National security is a very broad and loosely worded word, instead of the word public emergency, as in the Indian Telegraph Act
 loksabhaa main aadhaar bill bina sanshodhan ke paas hua tha
 In the Rajya Sabha, four amendments of Jairam Ramesh passed in the House as the majority here is with the opposition
 sansadeey ranneeti ke jaankaar maanate hai ki aisa hona kisi bhi sarkaar ke liye sharmindagi se kam nahin he
 Although the government is not obliged to accept the amendments passed in the Rajya Sabha, but under the rules it will have to be passed back in the Lok Sabha
 vitt mantri ne kaha he ki is bill ke tahat vyaktigat gopneeyata ke bhang hone kii ashanka sahi nahin he
 Aadhaar data will not be shared under any circumstances other than national security
 ek choti si kahani he
 i do not know whether it helps to understand the dispute of Aadhaar but can share
 is kahani kaa koi aadhaar number nahin he or na hi iskaa kisi ke paas biometric he
 In 1906, a law was introduced in South Africa that all Asian men would have to register and show an identity card on which they would have thumb prints
 jiske paas aisa nahin he to use waapas jahaaz se vahaan bhej diya jayega jahaan se aayaa he
 Gandhi called a public meeting against this and refused to accept this law as a black law
 gandhi ne puure kanoon kaa virodh karte hue anguuthe ke nishaan ko lekar bhi virodh kiya yah abhi bataane kii sthiti main nahin hum
 But the Finance Minister gave the example of America that it was only in 1935 that America made Social Security number
 ham 80 saal peeche hai
 It was challenged several times in America
 inakam tex ke liye zaruri kiya, kai nitiyon or aarthik gatividhiyon, hathiyaar rakhane ke liye ise compalsri kiya gaya
 This helped him in his National Security
 ise lagaataar chalange diya gaya or har maamle main unki adaalaton ne kaha ki neshnal security ek sahi vajah he
 a fundamental difference between the US Social Security Number and India's Aadhaar Number is that biometric identification is not used for Social Security Number
 arthath aapaki ungaliyon ke nishaan, ankhon kii putali kaa scan nahin kiya jaataa he
 a large part of the controversy over Aadhaar is also about biometric identification
 agar america main 1935 main soshal security number aa gaya tha to us desh main aadhaar kyon nahin aayaa yaa soshal security number main biometric pahchaan kyon nahin jod di gai
 Whereas in that country of dreams are also poor and the government subsidizes them
 maine ek vidhayak ji se baat kii jo aadhaar card banavaane kii prakriya se jude rahe hai
 He said that while working for many women and the utensils are worn, the knuckles are worn out
 aisi mahilaon ke biometric nishaan lene main dikkat aati he
 After becoming biometric, what will happen to the fingers when fingers are worn out later
 kya wo rashan kii dukaan se lautaa di jaaegi
 The same problem also comes with male laborers

 vitt mantri jetali ne 5 march ko loksabhaa main congress par palatwaar karte hue kaha tha ki unki sarkaar main bhi 1986 kaa juvenil justise bill or 1983 kaa african deveopment bank bill mani bill ke rup main pesh kiya gaya tha
 Jairam Ramesh told that he went to the Library of Parliament to check it
 500 pannon kii report padhi
 Both also went to the officers associated with the bill
 rajyasabha sachivalay se poocha ki kya ye mani bill he yaa nahin
 Both were not money bills
 ye ek note mujhe rajyasabha sachivalay se mila he lekin main chahta hum ki sadan ke netaa bataayen ki ye jaankaree kya menuphacture hui ki donon mani bill the
 Jaitley had to answer that he got this information from the Lok Sabha website
 rajyasabha ke up sabhapati pi
 J
 courion ne kaha ki ye data entry kaa masalaa ho saktaa he
 It will be dealt separately in the House
 jis data par ham itnaa bharosa kar rahe hai uske entry ko lekar galati ho sakati he, wo bhi usee sadan kii website par jahaan khadey hokar sarkaar aashwaasan de rahi he ki aadhaar card ke liye jamaa kii gai jaankariyaan li nahin ho saktin
 But why did the mps of Lok Sabha not work as hard as Jairam Ramesh did
 scrol news site ke anusaar loksabhaa main jab aadhaar bill 2016 main pesh kiya gaya to uske paas karne ke vakt 545 main se 73 saansad hi sadan main maujuud the
 The government does not have a majority in the Rajya Sabha, but there is a lot of confusion surrounding the provisions of this bill
 jairam ne kai sawaal uthaae jinhen sanshodhano ke taur par unhone rajyasabha se paas bhi karavaaya
 For example, biometric information, core biometric information and demographic information should be closely interpreted in the bill itself so that later they cannot be interpreted arbitrarily in the form of rules
 aadhaar skim main shaamil vyakti ko usase baahar nikalne kaa vikalp mili or iske baad usase judi sabhi jaankariyaan nasht kar di jaaen
 Authority should also give its certificate
 aadhaar ko aichhik hi hona chahie, anivaary nahin kiya janaa chahie
 The person who does not want to be a part of Aadhaar should be given other options to get government facilities and subsidies
 rashtriya suraksha bada hi vyapak or dhilaa dhaala shabd he, uski jagah public immergency shabd rakhaa jaae jaisaa ki indian telegraph act main he
 The Aadhaar bill was passed without amendment in the Lok Sabha
 rajyasabha main jairam ramesh ke chaar sanshodhan sadan main paas ho gaye kyonki yahaan bahumat vipaksh ke paas he
 Experts of parliamentary strategy believe that this is nothing short of an embarrassment for any government
 vaise sarkaar rajyasabha main paas hue sanshodhano ko sweekaar karne ke liye baadhya nahin he magar niyamon ke tahat ise waapas loksabhaa main paas karana hoga
 The Finance Minister has said that the possibility of breach of personal privacy under this bill is not correct
 aadhaar kaa data rashtriya suraksha ke alaava kisi bhi haal main saajha nahin kiya jayega
 Is a short story
 mujhe pataa nahin aadhaar ke vivaad ko samajhane main madad karti he yaa nahin lekin saajha kar saktaa hum
 This story does not have an Aadhaar number nor does it have any biometric
 1906 main dakshin africa main ek kanoon aayaa tha ki sabhi asian purush ko register karana hoga or maangane par ek pahchaan patr dikhaanaa hoga jis par uske anguuthe ke nishaan honge
 Whoever does not have this will be sent back to where the ship came from
 iske khilaaf gandhi ne jansabha bulaakar is kanoon ko kaala kanoon ghoshit kar maanane se inkaar kar diya
 i am not in a position to say that Gandhi has opposed the entire law even with thumb impression
 lekin vitt mantri ne america kaa udhaaharan diya ki 1935 main hi america ne soshal security number bana liya tha
 We are 80 years behind
 america america main ise kai baar chalange kiya gaya
 Required for income tax, many policies and economic activities, it was compulsory to keep arms
 isane unki neshnal security main unhen madad kii
 It was challenged continuously and in every case their courts said that National Security is the right reason
 america ke soshal security number or bharat ke aadhaar number main ek buniyadi fark ye he ki soshal security number ke liye biometric pahchaan nahin lee jaati he
 That is, your fingerprints, iris is not scanned
 aadhaar ko lekar vivaad kaa bada hissaa biometric pahchaan ko lekar bhi he
 If the social security number had arrived in the US in 1935, then why did Aadhaar not come in that country or why biometric identification was not added to the social security number
 jabaki sapanom ke us mulk main bhi garib hai or sarkaar unhen sabsidi detii he
 i spoke to an MLA who has been involved in the process of making Aadhaar cards
 unhone kaha ki kai auraton ke kaam karte karte or bartan maanjte maanjte ungaliyon ke por ghis jate hai
 There is difficulty in taking biometric marks of such women
 biometric banane ke baad aage chalakar jab ungaliyon ke por ghis jate hai tab uske saath kya hoga
 Will she be returned from the ration shop
 yahi dikkat purush mazaduron ke saath bhi aati he
 Many times finger tips of the elderly are not found
 motiyobind ke kaaran bhi putliyon ke nishaan kaa milan mushkil hota he
 Cataract surgery in many states of the country leads to loss of eyesight
 agar ham anivaary rup se aadhaar par nirbhar rahenge to aisi paristhiti main kya hoga
 Sometimes, the quality of the machines also makes a big difference
 bijedy saansad ne kaha ki sansad main hi kai baar biometric thik se kaam nahin karata he
 However, in many places biometric machines do not work in between
 agar isaki vajah se kisi garib ko usee din rashan nahin mila to uske saath kya hoga
 One question is the breach of privacy
 ek sawaal he aadhaar ke tahat jamaa jaankaree ko surakshit rakhane kaa
 It is absolutely yesterday that Bangladesh's foreign exchange reserves were hacked and $ 100 million was blown
 vahaan ke kendriya bank ke garvanar ko istipha dena padaa he
 In June 2013, Britain's Guardian newspaper Snowden was quoted as saying how the US National Security Agency spies more than one billion citizens of its own and dozens of countries
 unki internet or telephone kii gatividhiyon par nazar rakh rahi he
 Some time back Sony Picture's computer system was attacked by hackers
 china bhi site hack kar letaa he
 Cyber warfare is a reality
 aise main itnaa bada data surakshit hi he iskaa daawa ham kaise kar sakate hai
 In March 2015, the government told Parliament that more than 700 government websites have been hacked from 2012 to March 2015, but they did not contain any sensitive information
 sarkaar ke guideline ke anusaar samvedansheel jaankaree vaale sarkari computer baaki system se alag hai
 The comments news site scrol daat in par ushaa ranganathan ne likhaa he ki kuch din pehle radio par ek vigyaapan suna
 a company is claiming that it is India's first Aadhaar-based mobile app that verifies the identity of people working in your home such as driver, teacher, tenant
 ushaa ranganathan chetavanee de rahi hai ki agar ek privet company aisa kar sakati he to aap yah sochiye ki companiyaan aapke aadhaar kii soochna kaa apane hit main kis tarah se istemaal kar sakati hai
 So we will debate on security and privacy even today

 This story does not have an Aadhaar number nor does it have any biometric
 1906 main dakshin africa main ek kanoon aayaa tha ki sabhi asian purush ko register karana hoga or maangane par ek pahchaan patr dikhaanaa hoga jis par uske anguuthe ke nishaan honge
 Whoever does not have this will be sent back to where the ship came from
 iske khilaaf gandhi ne jansabha bulaakar is kanoon ko kaala kanoon ghoshit kar maanane se inkaar kar diya

 Required for income tax, many policies and economic activities, it was compulsory to keep arms
 isane unki neshnal security main unhen madad kii
 It was challenged continuously and in every case their courts said that National Security is the right reason
 america ke soshal security number or bharat ke aadhaar number main ek buniyadi fark ye he ki soshal security number ke liye biometric pahchaan nahin lee jaati he
 That is, your fingerprints, iris is not scanned
 aadhaar ko lekar vivaad kaa bada hissaa biometric pahchaan ko lekar bhi he
 If the social security number had arrived in the US in 1935, then why did Aadhaar not come in that country or why biometric identification was not added to the social security number
 jabaki sapanom ke us mulk main bhi garib hai or sarkaar unhen sabsidi detii he
 i spoke to an MLA who has been involved in the process of making Aadhaar cards
 unhone kaha ki kai auraton ke kaam karte karte or bartan maanjte maanjte ungaliyon ke por ghis jate hai
 There is difficulty in taking biometric marks of such women
 biometric banane ke baad aage chalakar jab ungaliyon ke por ghis jate hai tab uske saath kya hoga

 Many times finger tips of the elderly are not found
 motiyobind ke kaaran bhi putliyon ke nishaan kaa milan mushkil hota he
 Cataract surgery in many states of the country leads to loss of eyesight
 agar ham anivaary rup se aadhaar par nirbhar rahenge to aisi paristhiti main kya hoga
 Sometimes, the quality of the machines also makes a big difference
 bijedy saansad ne kaha ki sansad main hi kai baar biometric thik se kaam nahin karata he
 However, in many places biometric machines do not work in between
 agar isaki vajah se kisi garib ko usee din rashan nahin mila to uske saath kya hoga
 One question is the breach of privacy

 a fundamental difference between the US Social Security Number and India's Aadhaar Number is that biometric identification is not used for Social Security Number
 arthath aapaki ungaliyon ke nishaan, ankhon kii putali kaa scan nahin kiya jaataa he
 a large part of the controversy over Aadhaar is also about biometric identification
 agar america main 1935 main soshal security number aa gaya tha to us desh main aadhaar kyon nahin aayaa yaa soshal security number main biometric pahchaan kyon nahin jod di gai
 Whereas in that country of dreams are also poor and the government subsidizes them
 maine ek vidhayak ji se baat kii jo aadhaar card banavaane kii prakriya se jude rahe hai
 He said that while working for many women and the utensils are worn, the knuckles are worn out

 After becoming biometric, what will happen to the fingers when fingers are worn out later
 kya wo rashan kii dukaan se lautaa di jaaegi
 The same problem also comes with male laborers

 If a woman asks to vacate the ladies seat in a packed bus, then there is a 70 percent chance that the debate is going to start
 haa kuch aise praani bhi hai jo mahilaon se najar mili, isse pehle hi seat chhod dete hai
 Sadly, the number of such men is extremely low
 lekin kuch purush yatri aise bhi hai jo dheeth banakar mahilaon kii seat par virajman rahete hai
 For this, you do not have to leave the seat in the buses, for this, apply any of the following formulas - Formula-1 iron cuts iron, women-to-women there are some men who resort to their wives
 khud khidki kii said baith jate hai or patni ko maamla handls karne kaa aadesh paarit kar dete hai
 Then when two women start to show you, then who should protect between them
 formula-2 
 
 
 On this pretext, the girl touches some male passenger in the name of vacating the seat, for years, chest starts to show their acting talent
 wo biimaar pad jaaenge, gahare neend main sone kii acting karenge
 If the poor girl has no pity or does not have the energy to fight against the chickpeas, then she becomes silent
 lekin agar koi mahila seat lene par utaaru ho jaae or ladke ko pakad ke hilaa de to bhi ladke ise vin vin sichuation samajhate hai
 'brother brother did touch this excuse
 
 
 ’formula-3 tum mujhase seat maango main tumhe dhamkee duungamahila seat par baithe kuch purush aise hote hai jo mahilaon ko ghur kar, gande ishaare kar apni seat bachaane kii koshish karte hai
 They threaten even if they don't run
 jhagada karne par utaaru ho jate hai
 The home office vents all its anger on the poor woman
 kuch dar ke maare chup ho jaati hai
 But Rohtak's sisters have unknowingly shown the path of the rest of the women
 to is baat kii bhi gunjaaish he ki agar ladkaa yaa super active hormone se overloded mard ne zyada chuun chapad kii to belt yaa jootiyon kii chhap shakl par najar aegi
 By the way, these girls are on par with many men
 
 
 aksar purush yatri is baat kii shikaayat karte hai ki vaise to milaayein purushon kii barabari kaa dambh bharti hai, to bhi bason main inhen arakshit seat kyon chahie? wel, inamen se zyada wo log hote hai jo minurity, obisi, yaa essi asti ko milane vaale aarakshan kaa bhoga vilaas karte hai
 But when the turn of the women comes, everyone forgets
 mahilaayein dimagi taur par purushon ke baraabar hai, shaareerik taur par nahinditisi bason main 25 fisadi siten mahilaon ke liye rigerv hoti hai
 Six seats in 35 floor low floor buses and eight seats in 42 floor standard floor cluster buses are reserved for women

 parkon or smarakon ke liye desh-duniya main mashhoor nawabon ke shahar lakhanu main logon ko ab ek or park dekhne ko milegaa
 The Akhilesh Yadav government's announcement to build a world-class park in Lucknow in memory of late socialist leader Janeshwar Mishra has begun to be implemented
 rajdhani ke gomtinagar ilaake ke vyomkhand main 500 acre main prastaavit janeshwar mishra smriti park kaa swaroop kaisaa hoga, ise lekar lakhanu vikaas praadhikaran (ld) ke adhikariyon main manthan shuru ho gaya he
 Dr
 Gomtinagar situated in Lucknow, spread over an area of 85 acres
 ram manohar lohia park sabase bada he
 The proposed park will be about six times larger
 khaas baat yah he ki yah park pattharon yaa phir kancreet par aadhaarit nahin hoga balki isamen hariyaali or prakruti ko pramukhataa di jaaegi
 An official of the state government said, 'the area of the largest parks in the country is also around 120 acres
 yah nishchit rup se desh kaa sabase bada park hoga
 Like the parks built by the previous government in the proposed park, the emphasis will be on greenery instead of using large quantities of stone
 'sarkaar ne ld ke adhikariyon se kaha he ki is park ko viksit karne ke liye ve visheshgyon se vichaar vimarsh karen
 LDA officials have been studying and collecting information about parks in other countries of the world including America, Australia, England
 ld ke sachiv ashtabhuja prasad tiwari ne bataaya, '500 acre main park kaa hona apane aap main ek adbhut baat he
 So much greenery would be a supernatural experience for any city
 'unhone kaha,'ham duniyabar ke parkon ke bare main adhyayan kar rahe hai taaki vyomkhand ke is prastaavit park ko adbhut banaaya ja sake or yahaan aane vaale logon ko ek khaas anubhav ho
 In the coming days, the format of the park will be started to be implemented
 'praadhikaran ke ek adhikari ne bataaya ki ab tak jo shuruaati vichaar vimarsh hua he, uske anusaar prastaavit park main vistrut hariyaali kshetra hone ke saath jalashay, naukayan, sabhaagaar sahit anek aise sthal honge jo logon kaa manoranjan karne ke saath hi gyanavardhak bhi honge
 It is believed that the greenery of this park will be almost equal to the green belt present in Lucknow and not only will the residents of this city enjoy the greenery but it will affect the constantly rising temperature
 maaloom ho ki purvavarti mayawati sarkaar dwaara lakhanu main hajaaron karod rupee kii laagat se vibhinn parkon or smarakon kaa nirmaan karaayaa gaya he
 However, instead of greenery in these monuments and parks, stones are seen all around
 uttar pradesh vidhansabha chunaav ke teen charan puure ho chuke hai
 For the fourth phase, voting will be held on February 23 in 53 assembly seats in 12 districts, including seven districts of Bundelkhand
 nehru-gandhi parivaar ke is garh main is baar unke saath samaajawaadee parivaar bhi milakar chunaav lard rahaa he
 After the alliance, two boys of UP i
e
 Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav and Congress National Vice President Rahul Gandhi are jointly holding election meetings and appealing to the people to vote
 vahiin duusari taraf upi kaa teesraa ladkaa chunavi samar se bilkul gaayab he
 The name of this boy is Varun Gandhi who is a BJP MP from Sultanpur and is the most popular youth leader of BJP in UP
 varun gandhiko bhartiya janata party ne upi chunaav ke liye star prachaarkon kii duusari list main shaamil kiya
 However, Varun's name also came down in the second list
 varun ko tisare or chauthe charan main chunaav prachaar karnaa tha
 Varun neither appeared to hold any public meeting in the third phase nor is his presence seen for the fourth phase
 yahaan tak ki apane sansadeey kshetra sultanpur main bhi varun nadaarad hai
 In the 2009 Lok Sabha election, Varun won from Pilibhit seat with 50 percent votes while in 2014 Lok Sabha election, Varun became MP from Sultanpur Lok Sabha seat with about 43 percent of the votes
 itnaa hi nahin apane sansadeey kshetra main varun garibon se lekar yuvaaon ke bich kaaphi kaam karne ke liye jane jate hai
 Then what happened is that this firebrand youth leader of BJP, who has a strong tone against the opponents, is silent at the moment
 in vajahon se khamosh hai varunaraajnneetik galiyaaron main is baat ko lekar charchaa ye he ki narendra modi ke pradhanmantri banane or amit shah ke rashtriya adhyaksh banane ke baad se hi party main varun kaa kad ghatana shuru ho gaya
 In 2014, Varun was removed from the post of bjp's youngest national general secretary
 iske alaava 12 june 2016 ko elahabaad main bijepi rashtri ya kaaryakarini kii baithak ke dauraan puure shahar main varun gandhi ke poster lage
 In the posters, a demand was raised to make Varun Gandhi the CM face of UP
 rashtriya kaaryakarini kii us baithak main party upi chunaavon ko lekar ranneeti ko antim rup dene main lagi thi or elahabaad kii deevaaron par poster chaspa hone ke baad party main ye sandesh gaya ki varun apni daavedaari pesh karnaa chaah rahe the
 In fact, Varun himself was seen doing a road show in the city with a convoy of two dozen vehicles
 gandhi parivaar se taallukmanaa ye bhi jaataa he ki gandhi parivaar se varun kaa gaharaa taalluk hona bhi modi ke netritv main unke haashiye kaa sabab bana he
 Actually there is a big reason behind this
 varun gandhi ne kabhi party line ke tahat congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi yaa rahul gandhi ko lekar tippanee nahin kii
 Even Varun did not have the power to campaign for the BJP in Sonia and Rahul's constituencies of Rae Bareli and Amethi
 saarvajanik manchon par gandhi parivaar ko gherne kii bijepi kii aakankshaon ko bhi varun ne kabhi puraa nahin kiya
 Varun's absence is not just on the electoral forums, but social media is also showing evidence of his declining interest in elections
 ek taraf piem modi se akhilesh or rahul kii reliyon kaa jahaan soshal media par live prasaaran ho rahaa he vahiin varun ke twitor or fasebuk wal par upi chunaav se judi koi tasviir tak dikhaai nahin de rahi he
 After the announcement of election dates, only pictures and videos of events have been uploaded on Varun's Facebook wall among students in Rajasthan and Kerala
 haal hi main varun gandhi kaa aapattijanak sthiti main ek video bhi viral hua tha
 It is discussed that this is also a big reason behind Varun's silence and defensive mode
 baharhaal varun gandhi ke garh main 23 farvari ko matdaan he
 In such a situation, Varun's excessive participation in the election campaign raises both his status and role in the party
 saal 1540 main (9 may) aaj ke hi roj ek aisa yoddha paidaa hua tha jisane apni janata or samrajya se ladane ke liye koi samjhaute nahin kiye
 The history of India and the world knows this person by the name of Maharana Pratap
 ve mewar praant (ab rajasthan kaa hissaa) ke shaasha the or tab kabhi na haaraae ja sakane vaale mughalon se bhid gaye the
 This person, known as Pratap, was the eldest son of Uday Singh II and Jayavanta Bai, who is considered the founder of Udaipur
 dost to dost unke dushman bhi unki sainya kshamta kaa loha maanate the
 The stories of their struggles in order to handover their empire to the Mughals have become legend today
 aaj unki saalagirah ke maukey par ham khaas aapke liye lekar aae hai kuch aise facts jinhen pard kar aapkaa khun doguni raftaar se daudane lagegaa
 
 
 1
 maharana pratap ke shaareerik saushthav kii vajah se unhen bharat ke sabase majboot ladaake kaa tamgaa mila tha
 He was 7 feet 5 inches tall and carried 80 kilograms of spears as well as 208 kilograms of two swords
 iske alaava vah 72 kilogram kaa kavach bhi pahana karte the
 2
 maharana pratap kaa unke samrajya kaa raja bananaa bhi saral nahin tha
 After the defeat of Raja Uday Singh at the hands of his step mother Akbar, Kunwar wanted to place Jagmal on the throne
 akbar ne chitud or mewar kile par bhi kabja kar liya tha or rajput rajgaraane ne udaipur main sharan lee thi
 During that time there were long debates and the command was placed in the hands of Maharana Pratap
 3
 Pratap had to deal with his domestic problems before fighting the Mughals
 unke rajgaddi par baithne se pehle hi saare rajput raja mughalon ke samaksh ghutane tech chuke the
 Akbar also sent a proposal to 6 treaty negotiations before getting directly engaged in a war with Maharana Pratap
 4
 After the fifth treaty proposal, Maharana sent his son Amar Singh to Akbar's court
 ve khud vahaan nahin gaye the or isi baat ko akbar ne nafarmani maanate hue pratap par hamalaa kar diya
 5
 maharana pratap ke yuddh kaushal ke liye 1576 kehldighati yudhko hameshaa yaad kiya jaataa he
 They had half the soldiers in comparison to the Mughals and did not even have modern weapons compared to the Mughals, but they stayed and sourced the Mughal teeth
 6
 The battle of Haldighati lasted for four hours on June 18, 1576
 mughalon kii haalat is jang main patali ho gai thi tabhi unhen shakti singh ke rup main maharana kaa bhediya bhai mil gaya
 Shakti Singh disclosed all the military tactics and intelligence paths of the Mughals
 7
 In this entire war, the army of Rajputs was overcoming the Mughals and their strategy was succeeding
 maharana ne mughalon ke senapati maan singh (hathi par savaar) ke upar apane ghode se hamalaa kiya
 He and Chetak suffered deep injuries due to the elephant colliding in this attack
 unka ghoda chetak yuddh main unka ahm saathi tha
 Maharana went into a state of unconsciousness
 pratap ke senapati maan singh jhaalaa ne is sthiti se unhen nikaalane ke liye apane kapadon se unke kapade badal die taaki mughalon ko chakma diya ja sake
 Chetak ran a gallop from there with Maharana but he was badly injured
 usne ek antim or aitihaasik chalaang lagaai or maharana ko lekar haldighati darra paar kar gaya
 However, Chetak suffered so many injuries that he could not survive
 8
 After this war, the Mughals occupied Mewar, Chittor, Gogunda, Kumbhalgarh and Udaipur
 saare rajput raja mughalon ke adheen ho gaye or maharana ko dar-badar bhatakane ke liye chhod diya gaya
 9
 maharana pratap haldighati ke yuddh main peeche jarur hate the lekin unhone mughalon ke saamne ghutane nahin teke
 They will again raise their power
 agle teen saalon main unhone bama shah dwaara die gaye dhan se 40,000 sainikon kii sena taiyaar kii or mughalon se apana adhikansh samrajya phir se chin liya
 Maharana Pratap's indomitable courage, liveliness and never-say-die attitude are revered and read in Indian history
 aaj bhi maharana pratap kaa zikr samast bharatiyon ke liye garv kaa vishay he
