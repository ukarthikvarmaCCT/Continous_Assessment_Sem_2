 In the last election, just as the party won a historic majority by positively campaigning the works of the 49-day government in front of the public, in the same elections, the party has made the two-year functioning of the Kejriwal government a part of the campaign
 itnaa hi nahin haal hi main uttar pradesh or uttarakhand main bijepi kii jeet ke maddenjar bhi AAP nemodi ko nishanabanane se tauba kar lee he
 Party strategists feel that given the large number of voters in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand in Delhi, the Modi protest may backfire
 isse janata kaa AAP ke prati gussa badhane kaa jokhim zyada he
 Taking lessons from the experience so far of targeting Modi, the party has taken a Utern on the campaign strategy
 party ke netaa yah maanane lage hai ki pichley loksabhaa chunaav main bhi sirf modi virodh ke idgird gumti prachaar niti kaa nateeja tha ki party kii jeet sirf punjab kii chaar siton tak simat kar rah gai or kejariwal sahit sabhi pratyaashee chunaav haar gayi
 As a result, now AAP has put only the better works of the Kejriwal government at the center of campaigning in the corporation elections

 But with this, the question will also arise that due to the implementation of the election code of conduct, in what account will the expenditure of this advertisement go

 When asked Dhoni about the ongoing discussion in this regard, his direct answer was, 'your question i think is related to different captain for different format but for now let's talk about T20 format because we need T20 tomorrow
 Have to play the match
 ’dhoni is masale se pallaa jhaadna chaahate the or iskaa saboot phir se tab mila jab unhone british patrkaar ko bhi isi tarah se kade andaaj main jawaab diya

 He and Virat Kohli performed well
 aapane dekha hoga ki gendbaajon visheshkar spinneron ne acha pradarshan kiya jabaki unhen wicket se bahut adhik madad nahin mil rahi thi
 Dhoni said that after the drawn match in Nagpur, senior batsman Sachin Tendulkar did not give any indication about his future
 unhone kaha, ‘nahin aisa kuch nahin he
 The Indian captain said that it is difficult to reconcile the T20 format as quickly as possible from the Test but such is expected from professional players
 unhone kaha, ‘test cricket tii-20 se puri tarah se bhinn hota he lekin antarrashtriya cricketer hone ke naate hamen khel kii maang ke anuroop chalanaa padataa he
 Another practice session would have helped but we got only one day to practice

 sajid khan kii nai film 'hamashakals' bahut hi buree bani he or is baat kii gavaahi har wo darshak de rahaa he jisane ye film dekhi he
 Critics have strongly criticized the film
 ghatiya rivyuu ke baavjood film ne somvaar tak 40 karod rupee kaa kaarobaar kar liya he or ummid he ki film jald hi 50 karod kaa aankada bhi chhu legi
 Let's take a look how the film did such a good business even after such a bad review
 1
 Many critics have given this film such bad reviews that has never happened in the history of Bollywood
 kai critics ne ise 'jiro' star diya he or isi baat ne darshakon ko cinemahol tak khinchaa
 2
 film relies hone ke pehle jis tarah se film kaa pramotion kiya gaya wo bhi darshakon ko pasand aayaa
 a song from the film 'caller Tune' also left an impression on the audience
 3
 The director of the film Sajid Khan is known for cheap comedy, so the critics did not expect much from this film
 film kaa multi starer hona bhi is film ko phayda pahunchaa gaya
 Despite having a poor script, the film stars Saif Ali Khan, Ritesh Deshmukh, Ram Kapoor along with Bipasha Basu, Esha Gupta and Tamannaah Bhatia
 4
 Apart from 'humshakals' this Friday, the non-release of any other film was also a major reason for the film becoming a hit
 5
 The film was also ridiculed on social networking site and it also gave the film free publicity
 padhie 'hamashakals' kaa rivyuu a friend of item girl Rakhi Sawant slapped film director Sachindra Sharma in a packed gathering
 raakhi kii dost samaaroh ke bich main hi stage par chadh gai or diarector ko tamaacha raseed kar diya
 The model has accused the director of creating objectionable pressure
 peedit model ke mutabik ye maamla casting couch kaa he
 Actually, the occasion was the music launch of the film 'mumbai Can Dance Sala'
 film ke diarector sachindra sharma or item girl raakhi saavant mujeec launch ke dauraan stage par hi the ki achaanak raakhi kii dost stage par pahunchi or diarector sachindra sharma ke saath marpet karne lagi
 After the assault, the director's supporters removed the girl from the stage
 lagbhag dhakke dete hue use samaaroh se baahar nikaala gaya
 The commotion continued outside
 peedit model media se baat karnaa chaahati thi, vahiin doirector samarthak use media se baat nahin karne dena chaahate the
 However, after rescuing Rakhi Samvat, the girl was taken out and reached the police station
 media ke saamne aapbeetee sunaate vakt raakhi saamvat ro padin
 He supported his friend's allegations
 police chaowkee main shikaayat darj karaane kii baat kahi
 Accused director Sachindra Sharma, while denying the allegations against him, was just a publicist stunt
 vittamantri pranab mukherjee ne kaha he ki chaalu vittvarsh kii pehali timahi main pratyaksh kar sangrah main 26
 There has been a tremendous increase of 43 per cent and this pace is expected to continue even further

 Appreciating the progress made in the collection of direct and indirect taxes so far in the current financial year, Mukherjee asked the officers to lay more emphasis on tax collection

 The election of three seats in the Gujarat Rajya Sabha became quite interesting
 bijepi ne soobe main aise gheraabandi karke congress ke chanakya ko chakravyuuh main fansaa diya he
 The party is completely shattered in Gujarat, many legislators have already said goodbye to the party
 aaj matdaan ke baad do vidhayakon ne baqayda bijepi ko vot dene kii baat kahi he, jabaki bijepi soobe kii teenon rajyasabha siton kii jeet ko lekar sunishchit he

 Congress spokesperson Randeep Surajwala said - Congress elected MLA Ahmed Patel will ensure the victory
 lekin congress ke kai vidhayak bagawati tevar akhriyaar kar chuke hai
 Out of these, Congress rebel MLA from Gujarat, Singh Vaghelane said - When the Congress is not going to win, there is no point in voting for the Congress
 maine congress ko vot nahin diya he
 Ahmed Patel will not win, in such a situation, Congress should not have put the credit of Ahmed Bhai at stake
 bijepi gujarat ke teenon rajyasabha siton ko lekar ashwast he
 Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani said that our victory in the three Rajya Sabha seats of Gujarat is certain
 congress kii sahyogi party ensipi bhi maanakar chal rahi he congress ke kai vidhayak party ke saath vishwasghaat karenge
 NCP leader Majeed Memon said that such a situation has arisen due to Ahmed Patel, only half of Congress can vote for BJP, but ncp's support rebel MLA Hakubhai Jadeja said that if you want to stay in politics, then in Congress No more
 gujarat main do hi partiyaan hai
 The country is slowly becoming Congress-free, so if we have to keep ourselves in politics, then we will not have to stay in Congress, even three out of 44 mlas of Congress will be cross-voting
 jabaki congress cote se chunaav lard rahe ahamed patel ne kaha- mai kaaphi ashaavadi hum, mujhe or meri party ko vishwaas he ham jeetenge, aane vaale nattejey kaa pratiksha kare
 JDU MLA Chhotu Bhai Vasava voted in Gujarat, considered close to Sharad Yadav
 congress ko ummid lagaae hai ki eklaute jedyu vidhayak unhen samarthan karenge
 Whereas ZU MLA Vasava met BJP President Amit Shah after voting and said that i have voted for the ideology of the party prabhas or shraddha kapur kii bahupratikshit film saaho kaa darshakon se besabri se intjaar he
 The film is also considered to be the biggest action film of the year
 film main prabhas ke saath shraddha kapur bhi ection stants karti nazar aaengi
 However, even before this, Shraddha Kapoor has been seen doing action scenes in the film Baaghi
 lekin is film main ection kaa str kaaphi ooncha hoga
 She is playing the role of crime branch officer Amrita Nayyar in this film
 jaahir he, unhen film main apni gan kaa kaaphi istemaal karnaa tha, lekin shraddha ke liye ye utana aasaan nahin tha
 Shraddha Kapoor said that i had to get used to holding the gun because it was too heavy
 jab aap koi gan haath main lete hai to dabaav aapaki kalaayiyon par aata he
 If you look at my wrist you will realize that my skills are not strong enough to hold a gun and they really were not
 shraddha ne kaha, jab maine gan ko nayaa-nayaa hold karnaa shuru kiya tha to mere haathon main dard hota tha or haathon main asahaj si feeling rahati thi
 To strengthen the wrists, i started exercising and i used to tie tape to my wrists to keep my hands strong
 kuch dinon kii training ke baad main aaraam se gan ko apane haathon main set par lekar gumti rahati thi or kai baar to aisa lagata tha ki ye mere haathon kaa hissaa hi he

 christmas eve par dilli ke bazaaron kii raunak doguni ho gai
 All the major markets of Delhi were illuminated by public place and mall lights
 shaam hote-hote zyaadaatar parivaar apane bacchon ke saath saje hue becoground par selfi lete najar aae or mal main alag-alag activity or discount ne bhi logo ko baandhe rakhaa
 Especially youngsters and children were seen enjoying Delhi at Christmas
 insb ke bich saket ke dlef place mal menladi santane sabhi kaa dil jeet liya
 As soon as Christmas is mentioned, the picture of a bag full of old Santa and his gifts becomes fresh in the world
 lekin iske thik ulat dlef kii ye ladi santa bacchon ke saath selfi leti or unako chocolate baantati najar ai
 It is difficult to imagine Santa Claus as a beautiful woman, but looking at this Lady Santa, it seemed as if Santa Claus could have this look too
 dilli kii is ladi santa ne sabhi bacchon kaa man jeet liya
 People came out of the houses on the pretext of Christmas
 smog or pradooshan kii khabaron ke bich log apane bacchon ke saath lambey arase baad mouj masti karte dikhe
 Everyone believed that whatever the festival is, they give a message of peace and peace

 The way Delhi is being decorated on festivals is a great compliment
 anita bhabhi (actress saumya tandon)anguri bhabhi (shivangi atre)anguri bhabhi Vs anita bhabhi Now that there is a reconciliation between the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the bureaucrats who apparently work for them, will the functioning in Delhi return to everyday routine? Will the resentment between the elected government and Lieutenant Governor (LG) Anil Baijal — a puppet of the central government in the eyes of you — be resumed? It was a dreadful nine days

 aap ne in nau dinon se vijeta banakar nikalne kaa daawa kiya
 Columnist and social commentator Santosh Desai called the strike a 'risky but strategically sound' move

 In other words, you speared in a boil

 "she believes that a significant part of Delhi's voters understand that" you are being hindered in the work of the government and although we are effective, if we were free from these blockages, we would be many times more Could be effective
 ’’is baat ko sabit kar paanaa beshak naammumkin he
 Some people like Sheila Dixit, who was the Chief Minister of Delhi three times, make this matter laughable
 unhone reportron se kaha ki unki sarkaar ne bhi dilli ke liye purna rajya ke darje kii maang kii thi, par unhone siyaasi rakshakvach ke taur par iskaa istemaal nahin kiya
 She said, "we did not use this as an excuse to not do our work of development
" ’’ unka kahana tha ki 1998 main jab ve mukhyamantri thim, tab bhi bhaajapa centre kii satta main thi or tab gairajaruri takaraav ke bagaiyr ve apane lakshya hasil kar pai thim
 Kejriwal responded to the accusation, though twisted
 unhone daawa kiya ki unhen dikshit sareekhee takat hasil nahin he
 In a letter addressed to the Prime Minister, Kejriwal claimed that if Modi had not 'taken away' the rights of the previous governments of Delhi from the government 'through an order of 2015', then we will take the complaint of IAS officers' strike Don't come to you ham khud hi uskaa rasta nikaal lete
 Today you have all the rights and all the responsibilities are on us
 aise kaise kaam chalegaa?’’yah tedha sawaal he
 Because as the strikes — whether they are of bureaucrats or the Delhi government — have shown that the strikes do not work
 dilli congress ke adhyaksh ajay maakan ne bhi aap kii ‘gairsanjida dharna siyasat’ kii khaasi tikhi aalochana kii he
 In a tweet, Congress President Rahul Gandhi termed the strike as 'anarchy'
 unhone likhaa, ‘‘ek taraf yah naatak chal rahaa he or iskaa shikaar dilli kii janata ho rahi he
 "the Congress has been in a difficult situation — being an opponent of AAP in Delhi, it could not support its sit-in, but it also opened the doors to the possibility that without Congress, opposition unity is possible and did not run It is possible that the Congress will lead the joint opposition against Modi and BJP
 marlena kahati hai, congress ne dikhaa diya ki uske tuchh siyaasi takaaje or dusron se behatar dikhne kii chaalaaki siddhanton par haaavee he
 She points out that making frequent complaints against the lieutenant governor who has stalled the Congress government in Puducherry is an example of Congress hypocrisy and hypocrisy
 marlena kahati hai, ‘‘dilli main congress or bhaajapa simphni orcestra kii tarah kaam karti hai
 This is purely political opportunism
 ’’ desai bhi kehete hai ki congress main ab ‘‘baarik pechida farkon ko saaf-saaf bayaan karne kii kuwwat nahin rah gai he
 Yogendra Yadav, former AAP veteran and now president of the new political party Swaraj India, strongly criticizes aap's failures and its lack of "knowledge of the grammar and even constitutional provisions" of the government
 magar yadav bhi yah to sweekaar karte hai ki alji dwesh kii bhaavana se kaam karte dikhaai dete hai
 According to an inner AAP reluctant to reveal his name, "lg's gurur - even now after the confrontation is over - is clear from his refusal to meet with the chief minister
" iees afasar alji ke ishaare par chalate hai or alji centre ke ishaaron par
 This hatred is unprecedented
 ’’ iskaa matlab he ki maujuuda takaraav kaa khatm hona daraaron par mahaj paradaa daalana he
 Delhi BJP president Manoj Tiwari says, "nobody knows when Kejriwal will make the next decision to sit on the dharna
" koi nahin jaanata, awwal to ve dharne par baithe hi kyon the or unhone kya hasil kiya
 "just hours after Kejriwal moved from lg's house by effectively ending his strike, former AAP minister Somnath Bharti said that he and other mlas had tried to meet LG, but the police gave him their Kicked out of the premises under arrest
 naaraaz kejariwal ne twitor par poocha, ''yah kya chal rahaa he, alji vidhayakon, saansadon, mantriyon, mukhyamantri se milane se inkaar kyon kar rahe hai? kya alji jaanate hai ki unase milanaa unka sanvaidhanik kartavya he?unke paas milane ke alaava koi chaara nahin he
 This is strange
 ’’ yahi vajah he ki aap rashtriya rajdhani ko rajya kaa darja dene ke liye itnaa tikhaa abhiyaan chalaa rahi he
 Raghav Chadha, a prominent party activist and spokesperson, called the dharna a 'first victory', whose big battle is yet to take place
 11 june ko dilli vidhansabha ne dilli ko purna rajya kaa darja dene kii maang karte hue prastaav paarit kar diya
 This was a symbolic move
 akhbaar main chape ek lekh main yadav ne likhaa ki ‘dilli ko purna rajya ke darje kaa haq he
 "the central government can have complete control over the area of NDMC (new Delhi Municipal Corporation), Delhi of Lutyens and Diplomatic enclave," Marlena says, but "the rest of the city should have its own government of 2 crore people who are against them and only Be accountable to them
 ’’november 2017 main supreme court main rakhi gai daleelon main centre ke vakeelon ne kaha tha ki centre shasit pradeshon ko purna rajya main nahin badla ja saktaa, unhen raashtrapati shasit karte hai (jo alji kii niyukti karte hai) or khaskar dilli main karypalik adhikaar rashtriya suraksha kii vajah se puri tarah dilli sarkaar ko nahin saunpe ja sakate
 But BJP has been demanding full statehood for years in Delhi
 2014 main loksabhaa chunaav se pehle party ne rajdhani ke liye ek ghoshnaptr jari kiya tha or purna rajya kii maang usamen shaamil thi
 Union Minister Harsh Vardhan was Delhi BJP President at the time and it would be interesting to know that in April 2014, he said, "this election is being fought to make Narendra Modi the Prime Minister of the country, (and) we will first demand from him that Give Delhi full statehood
 ’’us vaade se farvari 2015 main dilli ke chunaav se pehle pallaa jhaad liya gaya
 Both Congress and BJP believe that the voters of Delhi should get full benefit of democratic franchise
 to phir purna rajya kii aap kii maang ko kapol kalpana kahkar majaak kyon udaaya ja rahaa he?desai kehete hai ki dilli ke rajkaaj kaa ‘dhaancha hi anban ke liye banaaya gaya he
 'and many observers believe that due to the way the BJP is taking advantage of this clumsy structure at the Center, it has become necessary to rethink the situation in Delhi
 aap shahar ke rajkaaj ke prati apane samarpan par garv karti he
 She claims that she is not being allowed to do her work due to the peculiar Khunas of the Modi government
 marlena kahati hai ki aap ke haath-pair ek behuda vyavastha kii zanjeeron main jakad die gaye hai or apni baat ke samarthan main sisodiya ke likhe ek lekh kaa hawala detii hai
 She was his chief advisor on education policy, who was dismissed by the central government in April after working for three years, as if an elected government should not have the right to retain its own appointees
 sisodiya ne likhaa tha, ‘‘chaahe vah anand vihaar main chaiyn chhinaiti kii ghatana ho yaa shalimaar baag main nanhee bacchee ke saath balaatkaar, dilli ke log jis akele chune hue pratinidhi ko javabdeh tehra sakate hai, ve bharat ke grih mantri hai, jinhen iske saath jammu-kashmir, uttar purv or madhya bharat main maovadi vidroh ke mudde bhi dekhne hote hai
 Do you resist too much? This question is for the voters of Delhi
 haalanki party bahanebaaji na kar paae or use apni kathani ke mutabik apni nitiyon par amal karne ke liye majaboor kiya jaae, yah pakkaa karne kaa akelaa tarika shaayad yah he ki unki is baat par vichaar kiya jaae ki endiemasi ke ilaake ko chhodkar baaki dilli kaa rajkaaj chuni hui sarkaar ke daayre main ho
 Ground of protest February 19, Delhi Chief Secretary Anshu Prakash accuses Kejriwal of attacking AAP mlas at Kejriwal's official residence for delaying a TV campaign
 virodh main kai civil sevak kaamkaaj band kar dete hai
 June 11, Kejriwal and his cabinet colleagues Manish Sisodia, Satyendra Jain and Gopal Rai go to the government residence of LG Anil Baijal and they refuse to leave until Baijal orders the IAS officers to end their strike
 Huh
 13 june,sisodiya bhukh hadtaal par baith jate hai, jain ke aisa karne ke ek din baad
 Four BJP mlas and AAP rebel MLA Kapil Mishra start their protest in the waiting room of Kejriwal's official residence
 16 june,pashchim bengal, andhra pradesh, karnataka or kerala ke mukhyamantri alji se kejariwal se milane kii ijaajat maangate hai, par unhen inkaar kar diya jaataa he
 The next day in the meeting of the NITI Aayog, they ask the Prime Minister to resolve the conflict
 17 june,iees afasar press conference kar daawa karte hai ki ve hadtaal par nahin the or ve asurakshit mahasoos kar rahe the

 The rioters caught in Nottingham also have an 11-year-old girl who underscores the fact that the rioters are mostly teenagers or young men
 police ne bataaya ki subah 100 se zyada giraftaar warrant par taamil kiye gaye
 Arrests and court sentences are also being conducted in riot-hit cities such as Birmingham, Nottingham and Manchester
 metropolitan police up sahaayak ayukta stephen kaavangh ne kaha ki unke kuch saathi luteron ko halki sajaa milane se naakhush hai
 However London Mayor Boris Johnson said, "one should not be under the illusion that the problem is over
" ’ The suspense finally ended and the election date was announced in Delhi
 mukhya chunaav ve es sanpat ke kaary kaal kii yah aakhri chunaav ghoshnaa he
 With this, the mercury is close to touching the sky in the harsh winter of Delhi
 chunaav main yun to teen partiyaan maidan main hai lekinmuqabla bijepi or aam aadmi party menhi hota dikh rahaa he
 The Congress is seen on the backfoot and is merely registering its presence in the field
 ab tak aam aadmi party chunaav ayog par yah aarope lagaati dikh rahi thi ki vah chunaav taalkar april main karana chaahati he
 But now this charge has become irrelevant after announcing the date
 pichhali baar sarkaar banaakar maidan chhod dene vaali yah party is baar daawa kar rahi hai ki vah satta main aegi or puure paanch saal sarkaar banaaegi
 Party chief Arvind Kejriwal is in the fray with his breathtaking promises
 hameshaa kii tarah unke paas aaropon kaa pulinda he or ve tamaam tarah ke sawaalon ke saath khadey hai
 On the other hand is BJP which wants to take advantage of Modi's wave in Delhi elections also
 lekin shanivaar ko piem kii raily ke baad party ke paas ab mehnat karne ke sivaa koi chaara nahin he
 This rally of Modi is considered to be his weakest rally till date
 isse party kisi tarah kaa sandesh dene main safal nahin rahi
 The party high command may be looking for the reason for this, but one thing is certain that there is lack of coordination among the big leaders of Delhi BJP
 pichley saal hi adhyaksh bane satish upaadhyaay abhi bhi puri tarah cmand main nahin hai
 That is not visible in his relations with the old leaders here
 bijepi is baar bhi modi ke naam par chunaav lard rahi he or kisi kaa naam mukhyamantri pad ke liye nahin oochaal rahi he jabaki ascharyajanak rup se aam aadmi party ne hi bijepi siem ke liye jagadish mukhi ke naam kii ghoshnaa kar di he!dilli chunaav main anya rajyon kii tarah mudde nahin he
 The problem of electricity-water-road is not like other states here, but law and order is a big problem here too
 yahaan ke halaat bahut vikat hai or aparaadhon main koi kami nahin he
 The Aam Aadmi Party has raised this issue and kept the BJP in trouble
 loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ne dilli ko purna rajya banane kii bhi baat kahi thi, yah bhi aam aadmi party kaa ek mudda he jis par vah bijepi ko gher rahi he
 Overall, this election will be interesting and will be important for BJP because in this new year she would like to sense the strength of PM Modi's wave
 yahaan tak ki china ke pradhanmantri ko bhi desh ke jidipi aankade par bharosa nahin he
 When Li Keqiang was the head of the Communist Party in the northeastern coal-field province of Liaoning, he relied on three sets of data, not GDP data
 ve unheen se apane praant kii arthvyavastha kaa akalan karte theah bijli kii khapat, rail se dhoe jane vaale maal kii maatra, or bank se karj
 These are figures in which local authorities cannot easily manipulate
 us samay se china main is vidhi ko “kekyang suchakank” ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 It has been used by economists who believed that local governments had manipulated the stubbornly and that the Center had been estimating GDP on the same basis
 aaj samasya aankadon main herpher kii nahin he, balki kisi vishesh varsh main siyaasi makasad ke liye jidipi main ek yaa do fisadi “jodtod” ko lekar he
 Xu Bin, an economist at China Europe International Business School in Beijing, says, "GDP figures are not accurate by nature
 kuch shodhakartaaon kaa tark he ki arthvyavastha tej raftaar se badhati he to china kii jidipi neeche kii ore jaati he or jab arthvyavastha mand hoti he to upar kii ore
 "in January, China announced that in 2015, it had announced 6
 9 pratishat kii vruddhi hasil kii
 Through this, the government wanted to tell that even if 7 percent growth was not achieved, the economy was not that bad either
 vah aankada kitna sahi he, is par bahes ho chuki he
 a report by London-based Capital Economics had calculated that the growth in the first two quarters of 2015 was projected to increase by one or two per cent
 chang liu or mark williams ne likhaa, “jidipi diflatter, jiskaa prayog avastavik jidipi ke anumaanon ko vaastavik jidipi main badalane ke liye kiya jaataa he, kii gananaa main khamiyaan hai
 "he calculated that the first quarter growth was between 5-6 per cent and not 7 per cent
 unka tark tha ki vaastavik jidipi ke liye 7 fisadi kaa aankada paane ke liye sarkaar ne mahangaai main kami kaa hisaab lagaaya hoga, jabaki har duusari gananaa main keemten bad rahi thim
 "the National Bureau of Statistics can manipulate the effect of prices to slightly raise or lower the real growth rate," wrote Carsten Holze, a professor of economics at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology
 or baad ke sanshodhano main, jab us khaas varsh ke data dhyaan se hat jate hai to use sudhaar liya jaataa he
 This cannot be done repeatedly, otherwise it will be revealed when the data is examined
 ” sarkari akalankarta apane hisaab se aankade main herpher karne ke liye takneekee talmail kaa istemaal karte hai
 This is not unique in the case of China
 america-bharat jaise desh jidipi ke akalan ke liye alag-alag tareekon kaa istemaal karte hai, jin par garmagarm bahes bhi ho chuki he
 In China, the government works with opacity and this increases the problem further
 2015 ke jidipi data kii ghoshnaa ke kuch hi din baad china ke mukhya akalankarta wang baaon ko rahasyamay tareeke se 26 janvari ko “gambhir anushaasanamak ulanghan” ke aarope main barkhaast kar diya gaya, yah aam taur par bhrashtachar ke liye saumy shabdaawalee he
 So when Li Keqiang said nearly a decade ago that GDP figures are ultimately "man-made" and "just for show", he certainly had a say
 kya china apane jidipi data main herpher kar rahaa he?china kahata he ki 2015 main uski arthvyavastha main 6
 9 per cent growth, which was very close to the target of 7 per cent despite the slowdown in the construction sector
 sarkaar kahati he ki is vruddhi kaa kaaran seva kshetra tha, jo pehali baar 50 fisadi se upar nikal gaya tha
 Some economists say that real GDP would have been down to 2 per cent, because if the figures were manipulated in the case of GDP decrylators, then real GDP would see an increase
 aam raay yah he ki jidipi main 1-2 pratishat kii herpher kii ja sakati he
 Bollywood's most loved and exalted star Amitabh Bachchan has recently made a shocking reveal

 The biggest challenge before the Janata Dal Secular, the party of former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda, is to save its existence
 jedies karnataka kii siyasat main kingmekar kaa sapana sanjoe basapa or ensipi se gathbandhan kar maidan main utari he
 Asaduddin Owaisi has also supported his party

 The Janata Dal led by Deve Gowda won the Karnataka assembly elections in 1994
 ve do saal tak mukhyamantri rahe or 1996 main tisare morche kii sarkaar bani to ve pradhanmantri bane
 After this, the Janata Dal broke up and formed its own party called Janata Dal (secular)
 maujuuda samay main jedies kii kaman unke putr echdi kumaraswami ke haathon main he
 Kumaraswamy has formed a government in the state, first with Congress and then with BJP
 2006 main ve bijepi ke sahyog se mukhyamantri bane the
 But it could not last for long
 mahaj ek saal baad bijepi ne samarthan waapas le liya to jedies sarkaar gir gai or rajya main raashtrapati shashan laga
 Subsequently, the JDS suffered a major setback in the 2008 assembly elections, when the BJP was successful in feeding the lotus in Karnataka for the first time
 2013 ke vidhansabha chunaav main jedies bijepi se badi takat banakar ubhari thi
 Yeddyurappa's rebellion from BJP benefited JDS but the party stayed away from majority
 siddharmaiya ke netritv main congress purna-bahumat ke saath satta main waapas aa gai
 JDS gained its place as the second major force after Congress
 rajya kii 224 vidhansabha siton main se jedies ne 40 siten jiti thim
 These were 12 seats more than the 2008 election
 jabaki bijepi ko bhi 40 siten mili thim
 However, BJP lost 72 seats compared to 2008
 voter share ke maamle main jedies bijepi se aage rahi
 20 to JDS
 2 fisadi vot mili
 So BJP 19
 9 fisadi
 The JDS was badly wiped out when the Lok Sabha elections were held in 2014, a year after the Karnataka assembly elections
 modi lahar main congress jahaan apana votbank bachaane main safal rahi to vahiin jedies kaa votbank bijepi main shift ho gaya
 The BJP won 17 Lok Sabha seats with a vote share of 43 per cent
 congress 40
 Won 9 parliamentary seats with 80 percent votes
 jabaki jedies ko mahaj 11 fisadi vot or 2 siten milin
 In this way, JDS lost about 9 percent of the vote in terms of assembly elections
 jedies kii pahunch muslimon, pichhadon, vokaliga or daliton ke bich khaasi kam hui he
 This is the reason why the JDS has suffered in not one area of karnataka but in all areas
 dakshin karnataka jedies kaa majboot durg mana jaataa he
 But in the Lok Sabha elections, the JDS also suffered a great loss in its fort
 2013 ke vidhansabha chunaav dakshin karnataka kshetra kii kareeb 25 siton par jedies ne jeet darj kii thi
 Whereas in the 2014 elections, the party was ahead in 15 assembly seats
 is tarah se ek saal main 10 vidhansabha siton par party peeche rah gai
 JDS has tied up with NCP and BSP to save its existence
 basapa ke liye 20 or enspi ke liye 7 vidhansabha siten usne chodi hai
 While Asaduddin Owaisi's party has also supported him in Karnataka
 vokaliga samudaay jedies kaa mul votbank mana jaataa he
 Apart from this, it has got support from the BSP to support the largest vote bank Dalit community in the state
 16 fisadi muslimon par bhi party kii najar he
 In the event of an alliance, the votes of these communities will be divided, which will directly benefit the BJP
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi devgauda par bijepi kii sahaayak kii bhoomika nibhaane kaa aarope laga rahe hai
 He says - JDS is dedicated to bjp's victory
 congress lagaataar jedies par bijepi kii bi team kii tarah kaam karne kaa aarope laga rahi he
 
 congress ye sandesh bhejkar muslimon ke ekamusth vot paanaa chaahati he
 The Congress is also seen to be successful in this campaign
 yahi vajah he ki muslim sanghathan jedies kii bhoomika ko andeh kii najar se dekh rahe hai
 jamaat-e-islami Hind general secretary Salim Engineer said that the first goal is to stop the communal party from coming to power
 jedies kii bhoomika andeh ke ghere main he
 Kumaraswamy has been claiming the politics of his father's legacy
 wo rajya kii raajnneeti main kingmekar banane ke liye old mysore ilaake main puri takat laga rahe hai
 The JDS is assuming that it will hold the key to power in its hands
 apni is raajnneetik aakanksha ko puraa karne ke liye wo 30 se 40 siten jeetne ke liye hi puraa jor laga rahi he, taaki apane siyaasi plan par amal kar sake

 It was because of her versatility that she became the first choice of composers like RD Varman and OP Nayyar

 The composer was also with Singer RD Burman

 In public life, Asha Bhosle was never seen getting angry, but in 2007, debutant singer-musician and actor Himesh Reshammiya made a comment that he was very angry
 darasal, himesh reshmia ne aashaa ke pati or mashhoor sangeetkaar (swargeey) arady varman ko naak se gane vaala singer bataa diya tha
 Himesh Reshammiya said about the 'RD' that gives songs like mehbooba-mehbooba (film Sholay), Yama Yama, Woh Sundar Saman (film Shan), that high pitch songs bring a touch of nasal voice and such fame
 The composer was also with Singer RD Burman
 himesh ne apni gayaki ke bare main tippanee karte hue yah baat kahi thi
 This comment of Himesh went unnoticed to Asha
 unhone himesh ko thappad raseed karne kii dhamkee tak de daali thi
 After this resentment of Ashaji, Himesh realized his mistake and apologized while clarifying his statement
 vishaal hriday aashaaji ne bhi himesh kii is galati ko bhulaate hue unhen maaf kar diya
 Later she also appeared as a judge on a music show with Himesh Reshammiya
 
 
 mahabuuba-mahabuuba (film sholay), yammaa yammaa, wo khubasurat samaa (film shaan) jaise geeton ko swar dene vaale 'arady' ke bare main himesh reshmia ne kaha tha ki hai pich gane se nejal wais kaa tach aa jaataa he or aisa femes compoger singer aar di burman ke saath bhi hota tha
 Himesh said this while commenting about his singing
 himesh kii yah tippanee aashaa ko nagavar gujri thi
 He even threatened Himesh to get a slap
 aashaaji kii is naaraazgi ke baad himesh ko apni galati kaa ahsaas hua or unhone apane is bayaan par safai dete hue maafee bhi maangi
 Ashaji, the giant heart, also forgave Himesh's mistake, forgiving him
 baad main ve himesh reshmia ke saath ek mujeec sho main bhi bataur jaj ain

 India and China may have declared the end of the conflict situation in Ladakh for almost 20 days, but the situation has not come back on track
 haal hi main chini sena ne bhartiya sena ke ek gashti dal ko vaastavik niyantran rekha tak jane se roak diya
 The incident occurred on 17 May, when Chinese Premier Li Qing was to reach Delhi only two days later
 bhartiya gashti dal ko roke jane kii yah ghatana siri jap ke naam se mashhoor ‘finger-8’ ilaake ke paas hui
 Prior to the visit of the Chinese Prime Minister, it was announced that the situation of confrontation created by the intrusion of the Chinese army up to 19 kilometers in the Indian border has ended
 daawa kiya gaya tha ki ghuspaith karne vaale chini sainik apni pehle kii jagah par phir se chale gaye hai
 The Army spokesperson of Udhampur refused to comment on the incident
 parantu sarkari sutron ne kaha ki finger-8 ilaake main thodi-bahut takaraav kii sthiti bani thi, jiske baad thalsena kaa gashti dal elesi kii ore bade bina laut gaya
 Sources said that after this incident, 14 Corps deployed in Ladakh stopped all patrolling
 dipasang main bheje jane vaale gashti dal ko bhi roak diya gaya
 In Dipsang itself, the Chinese army had put up their tents for about three weeks
 sutron ne kaha ki china ‘finger-4’ ilaake tak sadak banane main kaamyaab rahaa he
 The 'finger-4' area also falls under the Siri Zap area and is five kilometers from the LAC in the Indian border
 chini apane nakshe main daawa karte hai ki yah ilaaka unke seemaa-kshetra main aata he, jabaki bhartiya sena kaa daawa he ki yah ladakh kaa hissaa he
 The 1962 war is often cited in relation to this area when the Indian and Chinese forces fought a fierce battle in this area
 is ilaake main chini sena (piele) se loha lene ke liye major dhan singh thapa ko paramveer chakra se nawaja gaya tha
 However, sources said that at a time when India is trying to justify its stand at the negotiating table, the Chinese army has made a road claiming that the area is part of Aksai Chin
 unhone bataaya ki kai dfa bhartiya sena ne isi sadak kaa istemaal gasht ke liye kiya he or is par apana daawa jataati rahi he
 Chinese infiltration into the remote Daulat Beg Oldi sector on April 15 is believed to have been caused by the construction of a surveillance tower in Chumar Division
 is saal march maheene ke aakhri hafte main hui flag meetingon ke byore ke mutabik, chini paksh ne elesi ke paas chumaar divijan main nigaraanee tower ke nirmaan par aitraaj jataayaa tha
 Chumar Division is about 300 km from here
 sutron ne bataaya ki takaraav kii sthiti khatm hone kii ghoshnaa ke baad rocky nob jaise kuch khaas ilaakon main bhartiya suraksha balon ne gasht karnaa band kar diya
 Chumar, a remote village on the ladakh-himachal Pradesh border, has been a major issue for China and has been claiming that the area is part of it
 is ilaake main china kamobesh har saal helicopter ke jariye ghuspaith karata he
 Last year, China had deployed some PLA personnel here in this area and removed temporary storage tents of the Army and ITBP
 china kii seemaa se is ilaake main najar nahin rakhi ja sakati he par bharat ne kareeb aakhri bindu tak sadak bana rakhi he jo nau ton tak kaa bhaar sah sakati he
 There seems to be some lack of coordination among the various Indian Defense Forces
 itibipi ne kendriya grih mantralay se shikaayat kii he ki unhen 5 may ko china ke saath hui flats meeting se baahar rakhaa gaya
 At the flag meeting held on 5 May itself, the two countries decided to withdraw their respective forces
 china ne phir se ek sochi-samajhi kootnithik chaal chali he
 China is bent on reducing India's borders in maps
 ek baar phir china ne jataa diya he ki bharat ke jin ilaakon main padosi deshon se tanaav he use wo bharat kaa hissaa nahin maanata
 The latest case is related to Kashmir
 china ne ise ab ek alag desh bataanaa shuru kar diya he
 According to reports coming from Kathmandu, a map is being distributed to tourists and journalists who have come to Tibet, in which Kashmir is described as a separate country
 tibet main baante ja rahe media kit main china ke banaae nakshon ke saath tibet ke bare main bhi kuch jaankariyaan bhi di ja rahi he
 According to the history written by China in this media kit, it was only in 1950 that China invaded Tibet and captured it
 tibet se judi 4 deshon kii simayenisamen ye bhi likhaa he ki tibet kii simaaen chaar deshon se judi hai or wo chaar desh hai bharat, nepal, myanmar or kashmir
 That is, according to this map made by China, Kashmir is a separate country
 duusari taraf paak adhikrut kashmir main dam banane ke liye china pakistan ko aarthik madad de rahaa he
 That is, he is justifying the occupation of Pakistan on that area
 saaf he ki china kaa ye doharaa ravaiya bharat kii sirdardi badha saktaa he

 The journey from 2012 to 2017 for crude oil in the global market has proved to be a game changer for the country's politics
 pichhali congress sarkaar kii chunautiyon ko global crude oil kii keemton ne itnaa badha diya ki 2014 main mahangaai ke mudde par sarkaar ko chunaav main haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 At the same time, as soon as the election results in 2014, the prices of global crude oil proved to be a boon for the new BJP government formed at the center
 is dauraan hue utaar-chadhaav ke bich jahaan global market main crude oil kii keemat 125 dollar prati bairal se lekar 30 dollar prati bairal tak ludhaki, vahiin desh main petrol kii keemat 76 rupee se 56 rupee prati litre tak gai
 Now once again, the prices of crude have started improving in the global market
 modi sarkaar ko mila tha saste petrol kaa vardaanjanvari 2012 main manmohan singh sarkaar ke kaarykaal ke dauraan antarrashtriya bazaar main crude oil 125 dollar prati bairal tak pahunch gai or 2014 main hue aam chunaavon tak yah keemat lagaataar 100 dollar prati bairal par bani rahi

 It is worth noting that the price of crude oil is the biggest and most important expenditure from the central government treasury
 yahaan bachaa hua ek-ek paisa sarkaar ko apni aarthik-saamaajik nitiyon ko aage badhaane ke kaam aata he
 Read this: Economic Survey: Demonetisation of GDP, the biggest threat from the prices of crude oil has already changed
 However , the rules for determining the price of petrol in the country have changed

 lekin beete kuch maheenon se global market main crude oil ke prati din utaar-chadhaav or desh main tex ke aankalan se prati din petrol kii keemat nirdhaarit kii jaati he
 So during these three years, due to heavy changes in crude prices, the price of petrol is also fluctuating

 While crude reached the level of $ 30 per barrel, the price of petrol per liter in Delhi went down to Rs 60 per liter for the first time

 iskaa asar himalay ke glacier par padegaa
 If this happens, one-third of the glaciers in this region will melt and the 25 crore hill people living in the Himalayas and 165 crore people living around the Himalayas will be affected

 Due to this, the water in the rivers will decrease rapidly and this will lead to water crisis in the areas around the Himalayas

 masjid memnmajpadhana islam dharm kaa abhinn ang he yaa nahin, is masale par guuruuvaar kosupreme courtne apane puraane faisle ko punarvichaar ke liye badi peeth ko bhejne se inkaar kar diya
 The Supreme Court had said in the Ismail Farooqui case in 1994 that offering Namaz in the Kimsjid is not an essential part of the religion of Islam
 muslimpakshakaron ne is faisle par punarvichaar ke liye supreme court main yachika daayar kii thi
 Praying Namaz and offering Namaz in the mosque is an integral part of Islam
 ise lekar muslim samudaay se jude ulimaon ne ajtak se baatcheet main kaha ki namaaj padhanaa islam main ferj he
 It is necessary to have a mosque
 ayodhya maamle main muslim pakshakaar moulana mahfuj ur rahamaan kii taraf se supreme court main pesh hone vaale khalid ahamed khan ne kaha ki namaaj islam ke paanch farjon (mul siddhanton) main se ek he
 The 11 verses of the Quran and many hadiths prove that reciting prayers in the mosque is an essential part of Islam
 itnaa hi nahin ek haddees main saaf kaha gaya he ki masjid hone ke baavjood agar koi shaks apane ghar main ferj namaaj padhata he, vahaan, agar mahilaayein or bachche nahin he to aise gharon ko aag laga di jaani chahie
 He said that the Namaz was mentioned 11 times in the mosque from verse 114 of the first mercury of Quran to verse 118 of verse 29 of the Quran
 isse saaf jaahir hota he ki islam main masjid main namaaj padhanaa kitna ahm hissaa he
 However, Namaz is allowed to read in person during the journey
 khalid ne kaha ki masjid kisi kii vyaktigat sampatti nahin he
 That is why you can neither donate, nor shift nor gift it to anyone else
 ye baat islam or bharat ke vakf act main bhi kahi gai he
 Maulana Khalid Rashid Firangi Mahli said that the basic condition for offering Namaz in Islam is mosque
 quran main allaah ne jibraeel se kaha ki meri ibaadat ke liye kaaba kii tameer karo
 Not only this, when the prophet Mohammed saheb was going from Makkah to Medina, he established the Kuba Mosque on the way
 islam kii ye pehali masjid maani jaati he
 Subsequently, the Nabi established the masjid-e-nabvi in medina
 firangi mahali ne kaha ki ghar or vyaktigat rup se namaaj padhane kii tulana main masjid main namaaj padhane par 27 guna zyada punya hota he
 That is why the emphasis has been placed on populating the Islam mosque, it simply means that the namaz should be read in the mosque itself
 saharanpur ke shahar kaaji nadeem akhtar ne kaha ki islam ke paanch pillar hai, jisamen pehla tauhid (ek khuda par imaan or nabi ke bataae hue raste par chalanaa) iske baad doosraa ferj namaaj padhanaa he
 In Islam, worship is collectivity, not individualism

 Apart from this, on Friday, on one day of the week, people will read Namaz on two four neighborhoods and twice a year the whole city recites Namaz on the occasion of Eid

 chaahe ve dharmaveer bharti hon, harivanshrai bachchan hon yaa raghuveer sahay, kedarnath singh yaa kunwar narayan hon
 But this scenario completely reversed after Muktibodh
 uske baad hindi ke zyaadaatar mahatvapurn kavi madhya pradesh kii dharti par paidaa hue, jaise bhagavat ravat, ashok vaajapeyi, udai prakaash or rajesh joshi
 Actually Muktibodh laid the foundation of prolific literary tradition in Madhya Pradesh
 liladhar mandaloi ne kaha ki muktibodh kii sirf ek kavita 'andhere main' ko samajhane ke liye unke samooche sahitya ko padhanaa jaruri he kyonki unki sabhi rachanaaon ke sandarbh aapas main jude hue hai

 Ramanika Gupta also absorbed the voice of resistance from women along with other sections of society, such as Dalits and Adivasis
 geethashri ne apane vaktavy main kaha ki sahitya hamen un makbaron se aaazaad karata he, jisamen insaanon ko kaid kar diya gaya he
 One of the important sessions of this event was the poetry session in Padumlal Punnadhalal Bakshi Mandap - 'kavita ki juban'
 is satr main marathi, oriya, sindhi or angreji bhashaaon ke kaviyon ne apni-apni bhashaaon main kavypth kiya or phir uskaa hindi tarjuma bhi padhaa
 In this session Hemant Divte in Merathi, Paramita Satpathy in Oriya, Jaya Jadwani in Sindhi and Maneka Shivdasani in English read her poems
 is mandap main subah hue satr 'kya lupt ho jayega lok' main piyush daiya, bhanu bharti, aradhana pradhan or rafique masudi ne lok bhashaa or samskruti ke vividh ayaamon par baatcheet kii
 Addressing this session, Piyush Daiya said, 'we are talking about Lok here and Lok is absent from this whole conversation
 lok ke bare main bhi ham baat kar rahe hai
 We urban and modern people
 ' mukutadhar pandeya mandap main din bhar chale satr chhattisgadhi kala, samskruti, cinema or rangamanch ko hi samarpit rahe 
 It was evening and the sessions in all the pavilions were nearing its end
 puure din kaaphi vaicharik gahamaa-gahami kaa maahaul rahaa tha
 In the evening, the light conversation of a session on satire lightened the atmosphere

 ' loksabhaa or vidhansabha ke voting pattern alag-alagabijepi khilaaegi camel yaa phir doharaaya jayega itihaas?jharkhand vidhansabha chunaav ke raajnneetik sameekaran set kiye jane lage hai
 If the results of the Lok Sabha elections are measured for the assembly elections, then the ruling party has the upper hand
 isi maddenjar bijepi mishan 65 plus kaa target lekar chal rahi he
 But, looking at the voting pattern of Jharkhand, the party that did better in the Lok Sabha elections is not able to perform well in the assembly elections
 aise main yahi voting pattern rahaa to vidhansabha chunaav main raghuvar das ke liye mushkilen khadi ho sakati hai?loksabhaa chunaavon main bijepi ke netritv vaale endie gathbandhan ne jharkhand kii 14 main se 12 siton par jeet darj kii thi
 These results, judging by the assembly seats, show that the NDA coalition had an edge over 63 seats (57 BJP and 6 AJSU) in a total of 81 assembly segments
 jabaki loksabhaa main do siten hasil karne vaale vipaksh ko mahaj 18 vidhansabha siton par hi badhat hasil hui thi
 The BJP has also given the slogan of 'abki Baar 65 Paar', setting the target of 65 seats for the assembly elections based on this trend of the Lok Sabha elections
 haalanki, itihaas gavaah he ki jharkhand vidhansabha chunaavon ke parinaam hameshaa se hi loksabhaa chunaavon ke parinaamon se alag rahe hai
 This means that the electoral issues of the Lok Sabha do not show their influence in the assembly elections
 jharkhand ke gathan ke baad pehla loksabhaa chunaav 2004 main hua
 In this election, out of the total 14 seats of the state, Congress managed to win 6 seats, JMM-5, BJP-1 RJD-1 and CPI-1
 lekin ek saal ke baad 2005 vidhansabha hue to congress or jeemem puri tarah se saaf ho gaye
 BJP-30, JDU-6, JMM-17, Congress-9, RJD-7 and other parties managed to win 12 seats
 aise hi 2009 loksabhaa ke chunaav main jharkhand main bijepi-7, jeemem-2, jeviem-2, congress-1 or nirdaleey 2 siton par jeetne main kaamyaab rahe the
 The BJP could not maintain its supremacy in the assembly elections held after the Lok Sabha elections
 congress-14, jeviem-11, bijepi-18, jeemem-18 or anya dalon ko 10 siten mili thi
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections too, BJP had won 12 out of 14 seats in the state
 use chalis pratishat se bhi adhik vot mili the lekin lagbhag chah maah baad hue vidhansabha chunaavon main bijepi apane boote mahaj 37 vidhansabha siton par jeet darj kar saki thi
 It is a matter of fact that later six mlas broke away from Jhavimo and joined BJP, taking its tally to 43
 mahaj chah maah main aankadon main baari pherbadal dekhne ko mila tha
 NDA has got 12 seats in the Lok Sabha elections this time
 antar itnaa he ki 2014 main bijepi ne akele boote 12 siten hasil kii thim, jabaki is baar endie gathbandhan ne itani hi siton par jeet darj kii he
 Whether the BJP-AJSU duo will be able to repeat the results of the Lok Sabha elections this time, everyone's eyes are on it
 aise main dekhnaa he ki mukhyamantri raghuvar das nayaa itihaas likh pate hai yaa nahin? Samajwadi Party leader Aajam Khanne is taunted over the ostensibly immersion program organized by former Prime Minister late Atal Bihari Vajpayee
 unhone ravivaar ko kaha ki yadi unhen yah pataa chal jaae ki marane ke baad itnaa sammaan miltaa he to vah aaj hi mar janaa chahenge

 The minister could not stand for long in front of the young patidar and had to leave from there

 iske liye abhinayta ko sabhi drishyon ke liye doodh powder kaa sahaara lenaa padaa jise vah har baar soonghtey hue nazar aae

 kahani kaa ek vah ahm hissaa, jisase hamen seekhney mila ki abhinayta ko apni bhoomika ke liye screen par kai padaarthon ko soonghnaa tha
 For this the actor had to resort to milk powder for all the scenes which he was seen sniffing every time

 The actor learned from watching movies how the substance is intoxicated
 shots ke bich main yah ek manoranjak drishy ban jaataa tha jise dekh har koi hansane par majaboor ho jaataa tha

 '' How did a towel worth 25 rupees become 1 crore 20 lakh? Why was a modest shoe selling for 90 lakh rupees? And what secret was hidden in a ghagra which became 90 lakhs? The secrets of drug are hidden in the world, the answers to all these strange questions

 First he escapes from the world and prepares some chemical and in this chemical he mixes such a poison of intoxication, in the world of crime which is worth crores
 phir baari aati he zehar ke is ghol main tauliye ko dubone kii
 Actually, by doing this, he wants to fill the towels with drugs, so that the dust can be thrown in the eyes of the police and the law
 or is tarah drugs bhare chemical ke ghol main dubo kar wo tauliye ko sookhne ke liye daal detaa he
 The towels are then filled in the parcel and sent for delivery

 But this is not the only and lonely way

 Indian goalkeeper Aditi Chauhan, who created history by playing for English Premier League team West Ham United, has earned a good name in the sports world today
 lekin kya aap yakeen karenge ki aditi ne kabhi bhi footballar banane kaa sapana nahin dekha tha
 Thanji used to play karate and volleyball
 Yes this is true
 Aditi had never dreamed of becoming a footballer
 vaise to aditi ne kaaphi choti umr se hi khelon main bhaag lenaa shuru kar diya tha lekin wo footbal nahin khelti thim
 a good basketball player and karate player, Aditi was a key member of the school level basketball team along with being a black belt holder in karate
 lekin jab usne ek baar footbal khelnaa shuru kiya to sab peeche chhutata chalaa gaya
 Initially there were problems in the beginning, when Aditi thought of making a career in football, the family, especially Papa, believed that Aditi should not play football
 kyonki tennis ke achche player rah chuke aditi ke papa abhayaveer chouhan or uniwarsity level par neshnal record braker shotputor rah chuki aditi kii nani ko pataa tha ki yahaan khelon main bahut acha bhavishya nahin he, khaastaur se timgames main
 Father did not get the goalkeeping coach, but Dad agreed but now the problem was the goalkeeping coach
 aaj se 8-9 saal pehle hamaare desh main golkiping coach milanaa lagbhag naammumkin hi tha
 According to Aditi's father, 'when it said that it wanted to become a footballer, we felt that there is no future wasting time
 vaise bhi isamen tamaam pareshaaniyon ke saath sabase badi dikkat to ye thi ki yahaan koi golkiping coach hi nahin miltaa tha
 We tried a lot but did not get a special coach for goalkeeping
 phir hamane sochaa ki training shuru karte hai dhire-dhire manage ho jayega or yahi sochakar ham practice ke liye aditi ko lekar roj dwarka se jawaharlal nehru stadium aane lage
 'kaun Le Jayen Rose Stadium, where Aditi's football journey started from here, a big problem came up as soon as the journey started
 or ye dikkat thi ki aditi ke espiji officer papa piem kii security main the or mummy teacher thim jiske chalate aditi ko roj-roj practice ke liye laane-le jane main bahut dikkat hoti thi
 At one time, Aditi's football journey would cease, but only then did her grandmother, the founding chairman of the Moradabad branch of a large NGO
 wo aage ain or aditi ke liye unhone dilli aakar use roj training ke liye laane-le jane kaa jimmaa uthaa liya
 As a result of the hard work, Aditi and her family started seeing results of hard work and Aditi made her place in the Indian National Football team after playing for the Delhi U-19 and then India U-19 women's teams
 aditi ke kariyar main sabase bada mode tab aayaa jab unhone england kii longeberg uniwarsity main sports management main diploma ke liye daakhila liya
 Along with studying in Lonzburg, Aditi also started playing for the football team of the university and from there Aditi got a chance to play for the West Ham United Ladies team
 aaj bhale hi aditi ne indian footbal main wo mukaam hasil kar liya he jo aaj tak koi nahin kar paaya tha lekin aditi ne kabhi footballar banane ke liye nahin sochaa tha or naa hi itnaa sab hasil karne kaa sapana hi dekha tha
 Never felt that to become a footballer, Aditi says, 'I never felt that i had to become a footballer
 jab maine pehali baar footbal khelaa tab main class 9 main padhati thi
 After playing football for the first time, i loved this game so much that i kept playing
 phir jab main 15 saal kii thi tab maine dilli state kii under-19 team ke liye pehali baar khelaa tha
 Then two years later i got selected for the Indian Under-19 team and then started playing for the Indian National Team
 'euke padhai karne ai thiaditi aage kahati hai, 'aage kii padhai ke liye jab main euke ai thi to mujhe sirf padhai kerani thi main yahaan ye sochakar nahin ai thi ki mujhe premier lig main khelnaa he
 i had left home thinking that there should be a selection in the football team of the university
 jisase kii nae experience ke saath hi meri practice bhi hoti rahe
 Seeing my game there, people asked me to give a trial for clubs
 maine sochaa ki isamen kya dikkat he de dete hai
 Then i used to give trials on weekends
 aise hi ek trial ke baad meraa sellection yahaan ho gaya
 i have never dreamed of achieving all this, but yes i have worked hard
 or puri tarah se positive rahete hue maine game ko apana 100 percent diya he
 And the result of that is that i am here

 unhone kaha, meri cricket main kisi bhi str par kisi tarah kii bhoomika nibhaane main dilchaspee nahin he

 Usually, August 9 is considered the beginning of the Quit India movement
 par bahut kam logon ko pataa he ki ye andolan 8 agast 1942 se aarambh hua tha
 In fact, on 8 August 1942, the All India Congress General Assembly passed a resolution called 'quit India' resolution at the Gowalia Tank Grounds in Bombay
 iske baad se hi ye andolan vyapak str par aarambh kiya gaya
 What was special was that this movement started under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi, this movement was part of a well thought out strategy
 is andolan kii khaas baat ye thi ki isamen puraa desh shaamil hua
 It was a movement that shook the roots of British rule
 desh kaa pehla digital gaanv he akodara, yahaan kabhi nahin hota cash kranchagandhi ji kaa aitihaasik bhaashangowalia tanks maidan se gandhiji ne bhaashan diya
 He said, 'I want to give you a mantra that you can take in your heart, this mantra is do or die'
 baad main isi gowalia tanks maidan ko agast kranti maidan ke naam se janaa jane laga
 Shaken English rule At the start of this movement many big leaders including Gandhi, Nehru, Patel, Azad were arrested
 angreji hukumat itnaa dar gai thi ki usne ek bhi netaa ko nahin bakhsha
 He thought that doing so would make the movement read cold
 ajab-gajab baaten jo aapane ab tak suni nahin hongi
 
 
 The people took the reins of the movement after the arrest of the leadership of the leaders themselves
 haalanki ye anhisak andolan tha par andolan main railway steshnon, sarkari bhawanon aadi par hinsa shuru ho gai
 The British government held Congress and Gandhi responsible for the violence
 par log ahimsak taur par bhi andolan karte rahe
 There was such an atmosphere in the whole country that the Quit India movement proved to be the largest movement ever
 kaha jaataa he ki isaki vyapaktaa ko dekhte hue angrejon ko vishwaas ho gaya tha ki unhen ab is desh se janaa padegaa

 In these states, at least nine out of ten people expressed positive attitude towards the Prime Minister

 congress ke haath main cycle thamaate vakt chunavi ranneetikaar prashanth kishor ke jehan main bhi kuch aisi hi ummid rahi hogi
 But voters had something else in their heart and Kishore had to taste the first major defeat of his career, with this victory, Amit Shah has also accounted for the defeat in Bihar
 upi main 'haath' se nikali baazeeye shaayad pehla mauka tha jab congress ke kisi diggaj netaa ne kshetreey netaa kii kaman main prachaar kiya
 But this bet of Prashant Kishor did not work
 upi main congress pehle hi maranasann haalat main thi
 Prashant Kishore's team started the party's campaign vigorously by taking out Rahul Gandhi's Khat Yatra with the slogan '27 years, UP Behala'
 lekin yatra khatm hote-hote hi ye saaf tha ki congress apane boote kisi siyaasi chamatkaar nahin kar sakati
 It is clear from the results that the voters did not like to hold Akhilesh Yadav against his own slogan in the middle of the campaign
 Exclusive Election Result TV: anjana om kashyap ke saath Livejaba netritv nahin to jeet kaise?2014 kaa aam chunaav ho yaa bihar vidhansabha chunaav yaa phir punjab vidhansabha chunaav ke nattejey, prashanth kishor kaa jaadu tabhi chalaa jab maidan main damdaar cheharaa maujuud tha
 In UP, Prashant Kishor first made Sheila Dixit the CM candidate
 unka iraadaa dikshit ke jariye congress ke paramparaagat agadi jati vot bank kaa dil jeetna tha
 When it became clear that Sheila Dixit had failed to make an impact on the voters, Kishore and his team made every effort to give Priyanka Gandhi the publicity command
 lekin priyanka ne is role ko sweekaar nahin kiya or congress apni muhim ke liye koi cheharaa hi nahin juta pai
 The party was immersed in the sinking - rightly done by the local leaders who were not ready to listen to Prashant Kishore
 amit shah kaa badlaprashanth kishor or amit shah donon hi chunavi ranneeti ke chanakya bhale hi maane jate hon lekin donon ke bich matbhed 2014 ke chunaav se chale aa rahe hai
 It is said that Amit Shah did not have Kishore's close association with Modi in these elections
 ek vakt tha jab prashanth kishor gujarat main modi ke awaas par hi deraa jamaate the or koi bhi bada siyaasi faisla lene se pehle modi unki raay lenaa nahin bhoolatey the
 As a result of this enmity, Prashant Kishore suddenly decided to join the JDU after Modi came to power in Delhi
 kaha jaataa he ki prashanth kishor modi kii jeet ke baad party main badi bhoomika chaahate the lekin amit shah ne aisa hone nahin diya
 Detailed election results Karvez Live In the Bihar election, the contest was between Prashant Kishore and Amit Shah's promotional model
 jahaan amit shah kaa style puraane tareeke se party ke vafaadaar workars or netaaon ke jariye chunavi vaitarini paar lagane kaa tha, yuan main kaam kar chuke prashanth kishor korporate style ke peshewar andaaj main chunaav manage karne ke liye jane jate hai
 Since Kishore had a trump card named Nitish Kumar in Bihar, Amit Shah's strategy here had to be faced

 Learning from his previous mistake, the Union Minister did not make any disputed statement this time, but he said five such things which are worth noting - 1) 'I will not say much, people feel bad
 mujhe zyada kuch kehane kii jarurat bhi nahin he
 The gesture is enough for one who is sensible
 '2) 'mujhe panja mat dikhaaiye, mujhe isse chidh he

 '4) 'main kisi kaa naam nahin luungi
 This makes some people very upset
 '5) 'ab mujhe gane dijie taaki mediawaalon ko bhi aaj ke liye kuch mil jaae
 The special thing is that Sadhvi almost smiled during both of her rallies
 yahi nahin, manch se jab bhi bolne ke kram main sadhvi hansatii, unke saath shrota bhi hansane lagate
 Sadhvi finished both the meetings with hymns

 bhaajapa netaa mukul roy kolkata main party ke nae daftar hestings house main trinmul congress ke kuch parshadon ko party main shaamil karne ke kaarykram main unhen party kaa jhanda saunpane ja rahe the ki tabhi kendriya netritv ne achaanak kaarykram roak diya
 Parish councilors were asked to leave
 saath hi roy ko saaf-saaf sandesh de diya gaya ki bhaajapa main shaamil hone ke icchhuk trinmul ke harek netaa ke liye party main jagah nahin he
 After BJP got 18 seats in the state in the Lok Sabha elections, Roy stepped up efforts to bring Trinamool leaders into the party
 roy trinmul ke zyada se zyada netaaon ko party main laana chaahate hai lekin ve jin netaaon ko party main shaamil karana chaahate hai, unamem se kai sandigdh chhavi vaale netaa hai jinhen bhaajapa nahin lenaa chaahati
 Many such Trinamool leaders with dubious image have been under scrutiny in the Saradha scam
 kai netaa aapraadhik prishthbhumi vaale hai jo hinsa ko khuleam badhaava dete rahe hai
 The party leadership was receiving complaints that some Trinamool leaders who joined the party were starting to show awe and were creating mutual enmity, which the high command was very angry with
 loksabhaa chunaav se pehle bhaajapa ne trinmul ke baagi netaaon ke liye daravaaje khol die the jisase party ko kaaphi phayda mila
 It is believed that Roy did not properly investigate their background while inducting these leaders into the party
 party main shaamil hone vaale trinmul ke kuch sandigdh netaaon main vivaadit vidhayak shankudev pandas bhi hai jinase pravartan nideshaalay or sibiai sharada ghotaale main poochtacha kar chuki he
 One such leader is Monirul Islam who has been accused of making hate speeches against political opponents
 loksabhaa chunaav ke baad kul milakar trinmul ke teen vidhayak or kareeb 50 parshad bhaajapa main shaamil ho chuke hai
 However, some councilors have returned to the Trinamool again
 sthiti yahaan tak pahunch gai ki bhaajapa ke puraane netaa, jinhone bengal main party ko khadaa karne main varshon mehnat kii thi, khud ko alag-thalag mahasoos karne lage the
 The national joint general secretary (organization) of BJP, Shiv Prakash and Kailash Vijayvargiya, expressed their displeasure due to increasing tension
 shiv prakaash ne kaha, ''bhaajapa main jo bhi shaamil hoga, use party ke darshan ko apnaanaa hoga
 "the national general secretary and in-charge of Bengal, Vijayvargiya, made it clear that only those Trinamool leaders will be included in the BJP, whose image is clean and who are acceptable at the local level
" iske alaava, paala badalakar party main koi pad die jane yaa aagaamee chunaavon main tikat die jane jaisi koi shart nahin hogi
 He announced, "leaders who will be accused of taking bribe (cut money), will not be included in the party
 ''bhaajapa main aane ke icchhuk trinmul congress ke netaaon kii jaanch-parakh kaa makasad yah dikhaanaa he ki vah duusari partiyon se alag he
 Based on this image, in the 2021 assembly elections, BJP is feeling that it can oust Mamata Banerjee from power
 presidency uniwarsity ke sevanivritti professor prashanth re kehete hai, ''trinmul congress ke dher saare netaaon ko shaamil karke party kaa vistaar karne se bhaajapa ke saamne trinmul ke baagiyon kii sharansthali ban jane kaa khatra ho saktaa he
 
 
 And due to the disciplinary organization like Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, such steps were sure to be opposed
 ''ek anya kaaran yah bhi he ki bhaajapa ne loksabhaa chunaavon main vampanthi dalon ke vot transfar hone se 40 pratishat vot hasil kiye the
 BJP leader from Cooch Behar, Deeptiman Sengupta says, "the BJP benefited from the votes of the supporters of the left parties
 is vot ko surakshit banaae rakhane kaa ek hi tarika he ki trinmul ke daagdar netaaon ko party main shaamil karne se bachaa jaae
 "looking at the 2021 assembly elections, the BJP wants to project itself as a separate party
" isi vajah se trinmul ke netaaon ko lene main ehtiyaat barti ja rahi he

 This collection is a selection of the finest poems of the four poets
 in kaviyon main shamsher, nagarjun, agyeya or kedarnath agarwal shaamil hai
 It is a very enjoyable and enjoyable experience to read these four poets in one place at the same time, with a pithy role
 agyeya kii lambii kintu rochak kavita asaadhya veena to he hi, saath hi agarwal kii jab bhi maine usko dekha loha dekha jaisi kavitaayen bhi hai
 It is also challenging to serve the tireless writings of the word seekers in one place
 lekin is prayaas ke liye donon hi chayankarta or sampadak (anamika, madan kashyap) sadhuwaad ke hakdaar hai
 The four poets of this compilation are of different geographical, empirical ground, but the voice waves of the four are found moving with each other somewhere
 is sankalan kii khaasiyat yah he ki har kavi ko padhane se purv pathakon ko us kavi kii prishthbhumi (saamaajik, saanskrithik, vaicharik anubhav aadi) se parichit karaane ke liye tippaniyan or peethika likhi gai he
 The poems of the compilation have already been published independently and as a collection of poems also
 lekin chaaron kaviyon kii khaasi pasand kii gai, charchit kavitaayen ek sthaan par uplabdh hona sukhad baat he
 Anamika and Kashyap, in a role known as Kaifiyat, write, "these poets saw the struggles of freedom as well as the struggles of Hindi society and Indian national construction in their childhood

 Only then did he get a new vision to see and create society and culture

 Here it is clarified by saying that "we have not tried to make any order of superiority and have kept these according to the date of birth

 "it is really an attempt to make some paths and trails just to enter the works of these poets

 On the morned beams, there is a twelve-legged genre, the ceiling is covered, the roof is chirped, the bituyaia nache / raindrops on the floor are made in five minutes by the unassuming children / the mischievous master, in some way the mold of Adam
 agarwal kii 'main pati hum-ab tum patni ho' kavita main bhi shiksha or skool kii vyavastha kii jhanki milti haih bade-bade achhar likhata tha / jahaan kabhi murga banataa tha / kaan-umethi bhi khaataa tha / gaal laal thappad se ho kar jhnnata tha
 The diversity of the subject is good
 agyeya saanp ke bahaane manushya kii prakru ti par prahaar karte milengeh saanp! / tum sabhy to hue nahin / nagar main basna bhi tumhen nahin aayaa
 If i ask one thing, how did i get the bruise / poison? Everyone has written on love, but Shamsher's point is different: nothing is near me / even then i do love / i am not even close to me / yet i do love Missed love / There is deceit in her talk / Even then she is Anupam Sundar / Maya is her strength / Then she is also Anupam Sundar
 samagrata main dekhen to yah pustak isliye bhi pathneey he kyonki isamen pathakon ko in kavitaaon kii vithika main pravesh ke liye raah bhi muhaiyaa karai gai he

 The Supreme Court said on not giving the documents to the central government, your behavior on this serious issue looks careless

 is aadesh ke tahat engiti ne artio se puraani deazal gadiyon ke registration radd karne kaa aadesh jari kiya tha
 On this, the government told the Green Court that at present there is no provision under which diesel vehicles older than 15 years and following BS1 or BS2 standards can be removed from the roads
