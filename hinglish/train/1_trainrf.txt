' kavi mahmud darvesh iske pratyaksh udhaaharan the
 He was born on 13 March 1942 in Albikha, Ukka
 jab vah paidaa hue yah jagah philistin kaa hissaa tha, par baad main is par israel kaa kabja ho gaya
 It is said that when the Darvesh were only seven years old, the Jewish attack took place and all Palestinians were impoverished due to the help of British imperialism
 julm va vahshat kaa yah daur saal 1948 main israel ke gathan ke baad bhi kaayam rahaa
 Like millions of Palestinians, Mahmud Darvesh's family was not displaced, but deported from his native place because it was assumed that the land where he was born did not belong to him
 tamaam log apni jadon se ujaad gaye
 The sky was also divided with the earth, God was already divided, otherwise why would this slaughtering happen at all? Evicted from his city, Mahmud Darvesh's family resided in Lebanon
 vahiin unki buniyadi talim kii shuruuaat hui
 He later moved to the Soviet Union to study
 par darvesh se unka bachapan nahin chuta
 The climate in which Mahmud Darvesh grew up had a profound effect on his mind
 unhen apni aarthik haisiyat kaa dukh na tha, par apni zamin se lagaav kaa vah kya karte? philistiniyon kii apane raashtra kii mukti kii kaamana main kasmasaati mutthiyaan va yahudee aatank, jo israel kii saraparasti main kaayam tha, ko dekhte hue mahmud darvesh bade hue
 During this period, he wrote poems and also prose
 'philistin ke premi' sheershak vaali kavita main unke shuruaati shabd the -o meri priya !dard bhari teri ankhembedhati hai mere hriday kojab bhi main yaad karata hoon unhenunamem garajati he bijlidahakta he gussaviyog jhalkata he unamemour main samhaal kar rakhata hoon tera dard
 
 
 
 isi tarah 'ummiden or sapane' naamak apane prakaashan main ek baar gadhy style main unhone 'main kahaan hum?' sheershak se likhaa tha, "garmiyon kii ek raat achaanak meri maan ne mujhe neend se jagaaya; maine khud ko saikadon duusare gaanvvaalon ke saath jangalon main bhaagate hue paaya
 a barrage of machine guns was passing over our heads
 main samaj nahin paa rahaa tha ki ye ho kya rahaa he
 After spending the entire night running unsupervised with a relative
 
 
 main ek anjaan se gaanv main pahunchaa jahaan or bhi bachche the
 In my innocence i sat asking, "where am I?" And for the first time heard this word “lebanon
 ""koi saal bhar se bhi zyada ek panahageer kii zindagi basar karne ke baad, ek raat mujhe bataaya gaya ki ham agle din ghar laut rahe hai
 Our return journey began
 ham teen log the: main, mere chachaa or hamaara guide
 After an exhausting journey i found myself in a village, but i was very disappointed to learn that we had arrived in the village of Dair al-assad, not our village
 "jab main lebanon se waapas aayaa to main duusari kaksha main tha
 The headmaster was a wonderful person
 jab koi talimi inspector skool kaa daura karata to headmaster mujhe apane daftar main bulaakar ek sankari kothri main chupa dete, kyonki afasaraan mujhe beja taur par daakhil koi ghuspaithiya hi maanate
 "whenever the police used to come to the village, i would be hidden in the cupboard or in the corner because i was forbidden to stay there, in my madre country
 ve mujhe mukhabiron se yah kahkar bachaate ki main lebanon main hum
 They taught me to say that i was living with any of the Baddu tribes of the north
 maine apana israeli pahchaan-patr paane ke liye yahi kiya
 "can understand what was going on at the dervish when we were young
 vah siyasati gatividhiyon main shaamil hone lage
 He later became a member of the Israeli Communist Party
 tab tak vah apni kavitaaon kaa saarvajanik kavita paath karne lage the
 These poems were the words of the common Palestinian voice, its sorrow
 darvesh ke shabdon main nirvasiton kii pidaa dhalane lagi
 She wrote several poems titled 'for Mother'
 inhen main se pehali kavita kii shuruaati panktiyaan yon thim
 My heart is stuck in a clinging, i am burning in the fire of disconnection and i am growing slowly towards your loving hands, the biggest sorrow is to save me from the greatest death, where to hide your soul
 
 
 khaas baat yah ki darvesh kii kavita main keval pidaa, aansu, dukh, aakrosh, vidroh, sangharsh na tha
 They also had expectations
 vah khuleam kehane, likhane lage the ki ab tak kaa maanav samaaj tamaam aattaayiyon ko dekh chukaa he, unhen jameendoj kar chukaa he, aise main hamaare desh par tut pade aakrantaon kaa bhi bhavishya vahi hoga
 We will get our land, we will return home one day
 dard or sapanom ke mail ne mahmud darvesh kii kavitaaon ko ek alag hi rangath de di
 His poem is a poem of Palestinian dreams
 un logon kii awaz he jo asamay apni jameenon se, jindagiyon se, sapanom se, aasmaan se bedakhal kar die gaye the or beintahaa takaleef, nirvaasan, dehshat jhel rahe the
 Despite all the oppressed whose hopes and dreams were not dead
 vah apane logon ko apni kavitaaon se prerit karte
 See its hallmark in his poem titled 'shabd' - When my words became wheat, i became earth
 jab mere shabd bane krodhmai ban gaya bavandar
 When my words became rock, i became a river
 jab mere shabd ban gayi shahdmakhiyon ne kabje main le liye mere hontphilistin par likhi apni kavitaaon ke bare main unka kahana tha ki inkaa mahatva hamaari dharti ke kan-kan se iske ghanishtha sambandh main nihit he- iske pahaado, ghaatiyon, pattharon, khandaharon or yahan ke logon ke sambandh main, jo apane kandhon par baari boj or apni kalaayiyon tathaa aakankshaon par kasi janziron ke baavjood sir uthaakar aage bad rahe hai
 This element of resistance is the identity of the Palestinian people, the identity of the poetry of Mahmud Darvesh
 mahmud darvesh kii kavitaaon ne arabi bhashaa kii kavitaaon ko ek pahchaan alag pahchaan dilaai
 Most of his poems were translated into various languages of the world, including Hindi
 vah duniya ke mahaan kaviyon main shumaar hone lage the ki saal 2008 main 9 agast ko unka nidhan ho gaya
 The Palestinian liberation movement had a different connection with India
 isiilie unki kavitaaon ko yahaan bhi kaaphi tavajjuh mili
 When Darvesh came to Delhi to attend the afro-asian Writers' Conference in 1970, his work was honored with a Lotus Award
 mahmud darvesh stallin shanti puraskaar se bhi navaaje ja chuke the
 His love for poets and poems continued
 'ek yuva kavi se' sheershak vaali unki kavita kii panktiyaan hai -hamaari akritiyon par dhyaan na denaur shuru karnaa hameshaa apane hi shabdon sejise ki tum pehle hi ho kavita likhane valeor antim kavi

 The floods in Bihar have caused tremendous damage to the railways
 baadh ko kahar barapaye 2 hafte se zyada ho gaya, lekin abhi bhi railway baadh kii maar se ubari nahi he
 Not only this, according to officials, it may take months for many rail tracks to be repaired
 sabase zyada nuksaan samastipur rail mandal ko hua he
 The train services between Samastipur and Darbhanga were closed for more than 10 days, due to the rise of the Bagmati river on the Hi Ghat bridge, the movement of the rail has been stopped
 samastipur rail mandal ke senior disiem ke mutabik jabatak nadi kaa pani pul ke guarder se neeche nahi aata or pul ke bering or pillar kii jaanch nahi ho jaati, tab tak rail nahi chal sakati he or jis raftaar se dhire-dhire pani kam ho rahaa he, usase rail chalaane kii sthiti aane main abhi kuch or din lag sakate hai
 Samastipur and Darbhanga railway line is losing Rs 90 lakh per day
 nuksaan to aam janata kaa bhi ho rahaa he, jahaan log rail se 10 rupee main pahunch jate the, vahaan ab 200 rupee lag rahe hai
 Work, business has been destroyed
 samastipur ke paas pul number 1 ko bhi budhi gandak ke ufaan kii maar jhelni pad rahi he
 Apart from Samastipur and Darbhanga, Sugauli, Narkatiaganj, Gorakhpur railway line is also closed
 sugauli or narkatiyaganj ke bich rail line ko chalaane laayak bana diya gaya he, lekin narkatiyaganj orgorakhpurtrack ko durust karne main abhi 10 din lagenge
 The worst condition - Raxaul Sitamarhi rail line

 Governments claiming to provide the best service to the public during the journey of the train take decisions in sitting in air-conditioned rooms, and use big advertisements to take them to manzar-e-aam, but the ground reality is something else

 tippaniyan i went from Delhi to Patna on 12 May 2016 by Sampoorna Kranti Express train and now returning from Sampoorna Kranti Express from Patna to New Delhi on 15 May (sunday)
 
 
 jo manzar main is train ke andar dekh rahaa hum, rongte khadey kar dene vaala he
 
 
 The entire train is packed with passengers, and the worst is that of General Bogi
 
 
 yahaan aadmi ke upar aadmi baitha he, bathroom main bhi log baithe hai, koi hill bhi nahin saktaa, jaanwaron se badtar zindagi dekhne ko mili
 
 
 People are tempted to drink water and go to the toilet

 Here too, the seats are filled with passengers, along the way, to the bathroom
 
 
 koi tech lagaae khadaa he to koi puraa parivaar hi raste main baitha he
 
 
 Now, due to lack of way, people are not able to get water from pantry car for their screaming children, and on the other hand, the staff of pantry car - with the collusion of police and TT - are selling goods for much more than the written price
 Huh
 
 
 jab main yah dekhte-dekhte thak gaya to maine railmantri, railway mantralay ko twit kiya, uskaa jawaab bhi aayaa pienaar, lokation maanga gaya
 
 
 The reply was also tweeted, but came far ahead of the location in the name of Asar

 The effect was sure that the bogie number 3 which i had mentioned, along with water, tea as well as those who sold them, went missing

 jawaab bhi twit kiya gaya, lekin asar ke naam par lokation se kaaphi aage aa gaye
 
 
 The tweet proved to be the third party of Dhaka

 We and many people with us could not go to the pantry car for water, and they were not coming here

 It is 1 o'clock in the night, and in the hope of getting up in the morning, in the hope of waking up the people in the train, and the biggest - in the hope of getting water - the pleasant journey of the railway continues

 The Sanskrit teachers, who are undergoing financial crisis, have been protesting in Delhi for a few days
 gat 27 disambar ko in shikshakon ne jantar mantar par apana pradarshan shuru kiya or phir janakapuri ke sanskrit santhaan ke saamne baith gaye
 These people staged day and night in the cold winter of Delhi, but neither a minister came to meet them nor any leader

 Not just the oath, after the formation of this government, many such decisions were taken which are to promote Sanskrit language and education
 lekin hairaani kii baat he ki guest or contract teacheron ke rup main kaam kar rahe sanskrit shikshakon kii tankhwaah kaaphi kam he or kai saalon se nahin badi he
 Sanskrit teachers have been demonstrating on the streets of Delhi for the last few days

 His salary has not increased for many years

 55 percent of the teachers are teaching on contract
 agar yah shikshak permanent hote to 85000 rupee vetan mil rahaa hota
 The teachers who came to the demonstration said that the Sanskrit subject is being given place in the iits and iims, it is good but why is the Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan being ignored? On Wednesday, the Sanskrit Teachers Association issued a press statement stating that they had met the vice-chancellor of the Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan and the vice-chancellor had given assurances to listen to their demand
 ek shikshak ne enditivi se baat karte hue kaha kii kulapati ne kaha he ki unki maang ko gaur karne ke liye ek cameti banaai jaaegi
 If the committee feels that their demand is justified, then it will send its report to the board of the institution
 agar board unki maang maan leti he to phir yah maanav sansaadhan mantralay ke paas jayega or vahaan paas hone ke baad pradhanmantri karyaalay jayega
 Teachers say that if their demands are not met by January 20, then these people will sit on fast unto death in front of the institution

 The National Conference made such a decision because of Article 35A
 neshnal conference ke pramukh or purv kendriya mantri faruk abdulla kaa kahana he ki centre sarkaar ko anuchhed 35e par apana stand saaf karnaa chahie
 On Wednesday, he said that we will not participate in these elections till the central government clears its stand on this and does not pursue peace efforts in the state

 On behalf of the government, it was said in the Supreme Court that elections are yet to be held in the state, so the hearing should be extended

 Panchayat and corporation elections cannot be used to postpone 35A hearings
 It is now for the central government to clarify where it stands with regard to Art 35-A
 It's not enough to use Panchayat & Municipal elections simply to delay proceedings in court

 jab narendra modi duusari baar pradhanmantri pad kii shapath le rahe the, thik usee samay raashtrapati bhawan bhi ek nae itihaas kaa gavaah ban rahaa tha

 In front of him, up to Lincoln Memorial was present of 18 lakh people
 kareeb 3 kimi tak log hi log najar aa rahe the

 bhartiya ucchtam nyaayalay dwaara 1993 ke mumbai hamale ke maamle main pakistani agenciyon kii bhoomika bataae jane se jude sawaal par pakistan ke videsh vibhaag ke pravaktaa ejaj ahamed choudhary ne kaha, ‘‘ham is tarah ke kisi hamale main pakistan kii sarkaar yaa agenciyon kii sanliptata ki akshep ko puri tarah se khaarij karte hai
 '' Comments unhone kaha, ‘‘pakistan aatankwaad se ladane or bharat ke saath rachanaatmak, sthaayee tathaa parinamonmukhi samvaad kii prakriya main shaamil rahane ko patibaddh he
 '' choudhary ne kaha ki bhartiya ucchtam nyaayalay ke faisle kaa adhyayan karne ke baad hi pakistan is par vistrut pratikriya de saktaa he

 teen talaak par desh main mache ghamaasan ke bich uttar pradesh ke lakhanu vishvavidhyalay ne ise apane samajashaastra ke paathyakram main shaamil kiya he
 a detailed proposal for this has been prepared and sent to the Education Council of the university for approval
 sabakuch thik rahaa to agle satr se isaki padhai shuru ho jaaegi
 BR Sahu, president of the university's sociology department, said that a system like triple talaq is a bad practice for society
 is kuriti ko samaaj se samaapt karne ke liye is tarah ke prayaas bhi kargar siddh ho sakate hai
 This initiative has been taken under this effort
 unhone kaha ki is sambandh main desh kii sarvocch nyaayalay ke nirnay or centre sarkaar ke kadam ke baad hi hamane is disha main kadam badhaane kaa nirnay kiya
 The Head of the Department of Sociology said that students should study the evils like triple talaq
 ham paathyakram main teen talaak par centre sarkaar dwaara banaae jane vaale kanoon ko bhi shaamil karenge
 He said that there is a deep connection between law and society
 kanoon sidhe-sidhe samaaj ko prabhavit karata he
 The triple divorce bill will also have an impact on Muslim society
 sahu ne vishwaas vyakt kiya ki vibhaag ke prastaav ko sweekaar kar ajukeshan counsil agle satr se isaki padhai kaa rasta saaf kar degaa
 Significantly, on the issue of triple talaq, the Supreme Court had directed the government to make laws
 sarkaar ne hangaame ke bich 21 june ko muslim mahila (vivaah adhikaar sangrakshan) vidheyak 2019 loksabhaa main pesh kiya tha
 During his last tenure, the Modi government introduced a bill on triple talaq in the year 2018, but it could not be passed by the Rajya Sabha
 america raashtrapati baraak obama ne aagaah kiya he ki aatankwaadi sanghathan islamic state (aies) ke khilaaf ladaai main samay-samay par jhatka bhi milegaa
 He said that this is a long campaign
 samachar agency shinhua ke mutabik,obama ne america ke maryland main joint base andraj main gathbandhan sena ke adhikariyon kii ek baithak ke baad kaha, 'yah ek lanbaa abhiyaan banane ja rahaa he, isamen tatkaal uplabdhi kii gunjaaish nahin he
 The president said the militant network that occupied large parts of Iraq and Syria does not present any professional military challenge
 antarrashtriya sainya adhikariyon, white house ke sheersh adhikariyon or pentagon ke sheersh adhikariyon kii baithak aise samay main hui he, jab nai ashankaayen paidaa hui hai ki aies iraq or syria main america ke netritv main ho rahi bambaari ke baavjood nae kshetron par kabja karata ja rahaa he
 IS militants reportedly captured an army training camp in western Iraq and carried out bombings in the suburbs of Baghdad
 isse aisi chintaa paidaa hui he ki iraqi sena mukaable main sakasham nahin he
 But the White House has said that the president's plan against IS is succeeding despite some bad news
 white house ke press sachiv josh arnest ne mangalvaar ko ek samvaadadaata sammelan main kaha, 'ham us ranneeti ko amal karne ke shuruaati charan main hai
 But preliminary results indicate that the strategy is definitely succeeding
 ' In the Surat city of Gujarat, a working woman named Sangeeta became a victim of bullying
 shahar ke rudrapura ilaake main rahane vaali yah mahila der shaam ko ghar laut rahi thi ki tabhi paanch logon ne uskaa apharan kar use ek kamare main band kar uski pitayee shuru kar di
 They cut off the hair of his head even when he was not full
 yahi nahin bijli kaa karant dene kii bhi koshish kii gai
 In fact, the kidnappers suspected Sangeeta of having an affair with a relative, which led to his treatment with Sangeeta
 philhal sangeet kaa aspataal main upachaar chal rahaa he
 Seeing this act done with a Dalit woman, the local police has started investigating it seriously
 hospital ke ek staff ne bataaya, 'jaise hi us shaks ne poochtacha shuru kii or isaki jaankaree doctor rohekar ko mili, ve morchari kii ore daude
 There he quickly tore the Death Intimation Report and also deleted the entry from the Casualty Ward Diary
 iske baad pesheynt ko ianti department main bhej diya gaya
 'who was this person, it is not yet identified
 unhone kaha, ‘‘sarkaar kii nitiyon kaa swaroop kuch is tarah kaa he- jisamen congress ke tareeke ke saath gaay or shaamil ho gai he
 Rejecting such allegations, Naidu said that "no scandal, no scandal and even any mistake" has happened during this government and the BJP is winning elections across the country
 naidu ne kaha, ‘‘ham loktantric desh hai
 They have their own opinion, but the country has a different opinion
 ’’ unhone kaha ki desh ke sabhi hisson main janata pradhanmantri kaa samarthan kar rahi he
 Naidu said, "we are a democratic country
 unki apni raay he, lekin desh kii raay alag he
 He said that people in all parts of the country are supporting the Prime Minister
 upi main satta badalte hi sarkaar awaason kaa pherbadal bhi shuru ho gaya he
 Preparations are going on for CM Yogi Adityanath on 5 Kalidas Marg, the same other ministers can also get government accommodation soon
 upi sarkaar main up mukhyamantri keshav prasad maury ko 2 vikramaditya maarg kaa bangala mil saktaa he
 It is considered to be the most luxurious government bungalow after CM Awas in Lucknow
 keshav prasad maury ne bhi rajya sampatti vibhaag se yahi awaas maanga he jisapar jaldi faisla liya janaa he
 Dinesh Sharma, the second Deputy Chief Minister in the state government, may also find Kalidas Marg as Wobangla, where the second most powerful leader and his uncle Shivpal Yadav lived during the era of Akhilesh Yadav, though after the relationship with the nephew deteriorated and he was removed from the post of Kalidas This bungalow on the way was empty
 sarkari awaas ke baad agar vidhansabha ke bheetar ke kamaron kii baat karen to vahaan bhi donon up mukhyamantriyon ko bade kamare abantit kiye gaye hai
 Rooms Nos
 101 and 102, which used to be near Shivpal Yadav, have been given to Keshav Maurya, whereas the room that Dinesh Sharma got in the assembly was earlier with Azam Khan
 mukhyamantri awaas ke shuddhikaran ke baad ab anya mantriyon ko bhi sarkaar awaas abantic kiye jane kaa silsilaa shuru ho gaya he
 There are many ministers in the government who have become mlas for the first time, within all of them there will be an eagerness to shift to a new house
 haalanki mukhyamantri adityanath philhal kharmaas ke baad hi nae bangale main grihpravesh karenge
 The war of the new and old generation in the Yadav family of UP has once again come to the surface
 is baar zyada badhkar or khulkar saamne ai he
 Only after the assembly elections 2012, SP supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav himself had decided that he would hand over the legacy to Akhilesh
 iske maahaul banane kii jimmedaari akhilesh ke chachaa ramgopal yadav par ai
 After all, Mulayam knew that this is the time when, if he gets a full majority, he will hand over the chair of CM to Akhilesh, but all this without any dispute
 isliye akhilesh ke naam kii pairvi bhi ramgopal ne kii
 Anyway, after Amar Singh's departure at that time, Ram Gopal was the center of sp's politics in Delhi
 akhilesh ko free hand dene kii badi taiyarimulaayam ne tabhi tay kar liyaaki apane vakt ke saathiyon ko aahista-aahista lakhanu se sammaan ke saath dilli bhej diya jaae, jisase akhilesh ko free hand mil jayega
 Although there was no voice from the family at that time, Azam Khan insisted on making Mulayam Singh the Chief Minister
 tab bhi mulaayam ne ramgopal kii baat par vito lagaaya or apane tipu ko sultan bana diya
 After this, Mulayam, when he got a chance, slowly started sending his old comrades to Rajya Sabha, so that no one could interfere in Akhilesh's UP
 puraane saathiyon ko rajyasabha bhejaanaresh agarwal, darshan singh yadav, parasnath yadav or revati raman singh jaise mulaayam ke puraane saathiyon ko rajyasabha kii seat thama di gai
 Efforts were made that the companions should be respected and there should be no obstruction in the path of Akhilesh
 yahaan tak ki benny prasad verma kii party main isi shart par vaapasi hui ki wo akhilesh sarkaar ke kaam-kaaj main dakhal nahin denge
 Later he too was made MP of Rajya Sabha
 khamosh ho gaye amar singhiske baad baari ai amar singh kii
 After all the struggle, Amar Singh also returned to the party, which was opposed by Akhilesh through Ram Gopal
 tab mulaayam ne amar singh ko do took bataa diya ki aap rajyasabha lijie or dilli main mere liye raajnneeti kariye, par upi sarkaar kii taraf jaraa bhi mat dekhie
 This is the reason why Amar Singh, who has been a full-fledged interlocutor in the entire state government, remained silent this time
 muslim voton kii vajah se bache ajam khanjaahir si baat thi ki ab mulaayam ko akhilesh kii raah main bhavishya ke lihaaj se do hi rode dikh rahe the
 The first being Azam Khan and the second Shivpal Yadav
 mulaayam ajam khan ko bhi rajyasabha bhejnaa chaahate the, lekin amar singh kii sapa main vaapasi kaa virodh karne vaale ajam kii patni ko rajyasabha dene par majaboor ho gaye
 At the same time, he did not want to annoy the sp's biggest Muslim faces to an extent in the elections
 isliye ajam batch gaye
 Trying to shear on Shivpal then turn to Ishivpal
 pehle kaumi ekta dal ke vilay kaa maamla aayaa, jisamen akhilesh ke rukh ne shivpal ke kad par chot kii
 Somehow the matter was resolved that Shivpal retorted and said that the merger would happen soon
 mulaayam singh se baat karke hi main ye sab karata rahaa hum
 Just here Akhilesh got a chance
 pehle shivpal ke kareebi do mantriyon ko barkhaast kiya, phir shivpal ke saare ahm vibhaag chin liye
 Even Shivpal and Amar Singh's close chief secretary Deepak Singhal were removed by Akhilesh in a hurry
 akhilesh se milane lakhanu jaaenge ramgopankhilesh chaahate rahe hai ki shivpal kii sarkaar main dakhlandaji kam ho
 On one hand, Mulayam handed Shivpal the post of state president instead of Akhilesh
 duusari taraf shivpal se ahm vibhaag chhinakar akhilesh ne shivpal ko majaboor kar diya ki wo sarkaar se istipha den
 Angered Shivpal also threatened to resign
 iske baad shivpal dilli aakar mulaayam se mili
 Ramgopal will go to Lucknow and contact Akhilesh
 mulaayam kunbe main ghamaasan par shivpal kii 5 badi baaten, jaane kya hai inke minekhilesh kii chhavi par ho chunaavamulaayam jaanate hai ki upi sanghathan main shivpal kii acchhee pakad he
 That is why they are trying to practice Shivpal
 vahiin akhilesh chaahate hai ki sirf unke hisaab se or unki chhavi par chunaav ho
 They are busy trying for it
 amar singh bole- baccha jawan ho gaya haiye baat shivpal or ajam ko mulaayam kaise samajhaayenge, ye to yadav parivaar jane
 But perhaps Amar Singh has understood this
 isiilie kabhi shivpal ke khayr-khwaah maane jane vaale amar ne rukh bhaanpate hue 'aaj tak' se kaha ki maine akhilesh ke khilaaf kuch din pehle jo rosh jataayaa, wo bhi galat tha
 We all old people will have to agree that Akhilesh is not a child playing in front of us, but the main guardian of crores of people of UP
 baccha jawan ho gaya he
 Akhilesh's Shivpal uncle and Amar uncle should understand this
 amar singh ne to yahaan tak kaha ki main samaajawaadee nahin mulaayamavaadi hum, saath hi mulymputravaadi bhi hum

 haalanki unhone mana ki yah ek sarkari daura tha or protocol kii vajah se tamaam kaaryakarta usamen shaamil nahin ho sakate the, par bijepi ke kai sthaneey netaaon ko nyotaa milane kii sthiti main khud ko nazarandaaj kiya janaa unhen chubh rahaa he
 He said, "I worked honestly for the party for over 40 years
 kabhi kuch nahin maanga
 The responsibility that came from the organization continued to play
 lekin ab protocol ke naam par mujhe hi pradhanmantri ke kaaryakramon main bulaava nahin miltaa
 While external leaders are being respected
 "unhone kaha, banaras ke saansad kapradhanmantrihona or is vajah se har kaarykram main unase na milwa paane kii majaburi samaj aati he par piem ke saansad pratinidhi bhi aam kaaryakartaaon kii pahunch main nahin hai
 This is sad
 rajya ke sthaneey sanghathan, theka tantra kaa shikaar ho chuke hai
 The party's core worker is angry with the current situation
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki eemaandaaree se sanghathan ke liye kaam karne vaale haasiye par hai
 This is not advani-vajpayee's party
 haalanki party ke pradesh pravaktaa shalbhamani treepathi in aaropon ko puri tarah khaarij karte hai
 He says, "BJP is a different party than the rut
 jisamen kaaryakarta hameshaa se sarvopari rahe hai
 "on the other hand, a leader of the UP bjp's Scheduled Caste Tribe Front sees the role of workers in the party and the by-election results in another way
 naam na chhapane kii shart par wo iske peeche vidhansabha chunaav main us naare ko badi vajah maanate hai jise satta pate hi bijepi bhul gai
 He said, "the slogan of 'do kod baki bhi jo' in UP was historic
 akhilesh yadav ke netritv main sapa or usase pehle mayawati ke netritv main basapa ke shashan main khaas jatiyon ko satta sangrakshan mila hua tha
 People then believed in the bjp's slogan, but in the first 12 months of Yogi's government this trust has been severely broken
 "unka aarope he ki jis tarah maaya or akhilesh kii sarkaar main kuch jatiyaan thanon, prashasan ke maamalon main dabang dikh rahi thim vaise hi yogi kii sarkaar main bhi chuninda jatiyon ko 'satta sangrakshan' mila hua he
 From Gorakhpur to Ghaziabad, it can be seen in dozens of instances of persecution, murder and assault
 log naaraaz hai
 (the slogan of the addition to the two except the two was allegedly given by the BJP to connect the party with all except Yadav and Jatav castes)
 bijepi pradesh pravaktaa yah maanate hai ki kuch kamiyaan rah gayi
 We accept the by-election results
 kamiyon ko durust karenge
 He said, the workers have always been the party's capital
 2014 kaa aam chunaav ho yaa 2017 kaa vidhansabha chunaav
 The party won because of activists
 unhone yah daleel bhi di- "saadhaaran pariwaron se aane vaale modi kaa pradhanmantri, yogi kaa mukhyamantri or shri ramnath kovind kaa raashtrapati bananaa is baat kaa saboot he
 "shahnawaz Alam, a state-wide agitator over alleged power-sponsored atrocities in the Akhilesh government, carries forward the point of the leader of the Scheduled Front," the police station and government offices remain the base of recovery
 in par kuch jatiyon kaa kabza he
 The general public responds to this kind of hooliganism that flourished under the patronage of power, as it did in Gorakhpur and Phulpur
 " haalanki vikalp ke taur par sapa ke chunaav par wo apni chintaa bhi jaahir karte hai
 It is also said that for the last several elections in UP, all the issues are revolving there
 inhen muddon par kai dashak se chunaav ladaa ja rahaa he
 The public votes
 sarkarein banati hai
 But the issue remains the same
 shahanvaj kehete hai ki upi ko bijepi, sapa or basapa kaa vikalp talashna hoga
 But what is the alternative, they themselves do not have the answer
 north east main party kaa kaam kar chuke upi ikai ke ek netaa bijepi kii andruni chizon ko duusari tarah se dekhte hai
 On condition of anonymity, he said, "before the elections, Swami Prasad Maurya, then no longer understood the compulsion to include leaders like Naresh Aggarwal in the party
 in vajahon se dilli mukhyalay samet tamaam party daftar pichley kuch saalon main aam kaaryakartaaon kii pahunch se dur hue hai
 This gathering is of people who are famous for queuing up to gain power
 lekin purvottar main swami prasad maury or naresh agarwal jaise duusari party se laae netaaon ke sahare bijepi kii raajnneeti ke sawaal par wo chup ho gaye
 But it must be accepted that the bjp's character, character and face are at the moment
 unhone safai di, "sirf is ek aadhaar par upi se purvottar kii tulana karnaa thik nahin he

 Cow Ministry will be formed when But Shivraj ji, do you know in what circumstances the cow-dynasty is forced to live in your state or how these cows are going to die in the face of death? In the name of cows BJP and Congress are going to ask for votes in elections It is, the same cow is dying on the streets of Madhya Pradesh, suffering from agony for hours
 kyonki inke rahane ke liye gaushalaon main jagah nahin he or majaburi main inhe sadakon par yaa sadak kinare jahaan kahin bhi jagah mil rahi he, ye jhund ke jhund main vahaan ikattha ho rahi hai

 bulandshahr hinsa maamle main uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ne kaha ki is maamle main sarkaar ne jo kadam uthaae hai, uske liye saraahna honi chahie
 Along with this, CM Yogi has described this incident as a 'political conspiracy' against his government
 unhone kaha ki unki sarkaar is sajeesh ko benakaab karne main kaamyaab rahi
 The violence spread in Bulandshahr following suspicion of Gokshi, in which two people including an inspector were killed
 siem yogi ne media ko sambodhit karte hue kaha, 'bulandshahr kii ghatana ek sajeesh thi
 The conspiracy has been exposed
 yah sajeesh vahi log kar rahe hai, jin logon ne pradesh main jahrili sharaab banaakar, yahaan ke logon ko maarane kaa prayaas kiya tha
 This was a political conspiracy and these conspiracies are done by those who are cowardly
 jo aamane-saamne kisi chunauti ko lene kii sthiti main nahin hai
 With this, CM Yogi said, 'they want innocent people to be victims of their conspiracy
 pradesh sarkaar aisi kisi bhi sajeesh ko kaamyaab nahin hone degi
 In such a situation, the administration will deal with and deal with strictness
 bulandshahr kii ghatana main shashan or prashasan donon sakhti se pesh ai hai
 Staying within the purview of the law, the state government has exposed a big conspiracy
 ve log danga karana chaahate the, gokshi karke araajaktaa failaana chaahate the
 The state government should be commended for exposing a big conspiracy
 jo log isko lekar bayaanbaji kar rahe hai ve apni vifaltaa chupa rahe hai
 CM Yogi Adityanath had earlier termed the Bulandshahr violence as 'an accident'
 bataa den, bulandshahr hinsa or inspector subodh kumaar singh kii hatya kaa mukhya aaropee abhi bhi faraar he
 The police have not been able to find him
 iske alaava upi police kii is maamle main ek or laaparvaahee saamne ai he
 The police arrested four innocent people in the Gokshi case, now 17 days later they have declared themselves innocent and said that they will go to court themselves for their release

 vitt mantri arun jetali ne ek baar phir digital karency ke badhaave par jor dete hue kaha ki kam nakadi vaali arthvyavastha bananaa har desh ke hit main he or yah baat bahut baar likhi ja chuki he
 He said that digital currency does not mean eliminating cash, it means less cash
 unhone kaha ki pichley dedh maheene main digital arthvyavastha tej hui he
 Out of 75 crore, 45 crore debit-credit cards are in active use
 vitt mantri ne kam nakadi vaali arthvyavastha par jor dete hue kaha ki isse sarkaar kii aay badhegi or isse sarkaar ko gramin kshetra main buniyadi suvidhaayen badhaane or raksha mad par adhik aavanton karne main madad milegi
 He said that digital currency is understandable to common Indian, but some people understand it later
 dirghakaalin puunjigat laabh par kar lagane kii manshaa nahin: jetlijetali ne saath hi ye bhi spasht kiya ki sheyaron kii kharid-farokht main dirghakaalin puunjigat laabh par kar aropit karne kaa sarkaar kaa koi iraadaa nahin he
 In reference to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's speech at a Mumbai event, Jaitley said that the media's interpretation of Modi's speech was not correct
 unhone spasht kiya, media ke ek halake ne us bhaashan kii galat vyakhya kii he or usne yah arth nikaalnaa shuru kiya ki isamen paroksh rup se pratibhutiyon ke kaarobaar main dirghakaalin puunjigat laabh par kar aropit kiye ja sakane kaa sanket he
 This interpretation is absolutely wrong
 unhone kaha, pradhanmantri ne pratyaksh yaa paroksh rup se aisa koi bayaan nahin diya, isliye main yah bilkul spasht karnaa chahta hum ki kisi ke liye is nishkarsh par pahunchane kaa koi aadhaar nahin he kyonki pradhanmantri ne aisa kuch nahin kaha he or naa hi sarkaar kii aisi koi manshaa he jaisaa ki media main kaha gaya he

 Significantly, ISRO was about to launch its state-of-the-art communication satellite G-SAT14, which would have carried a rocket named GSLV D5 into space
 ye prakshepan sriharikota ke shri satish dhawan antariksh centre se shaam 4 bajkar 50 minute par hona tha
 The biggest feature of this launch vehicle is that the cryogenic engine installed in it has been developed by ISRO entirely in the country
 jieselvi di-5 ke saath 1982 kilogram kaa ek upgrah bhi saath bhejne kii yojana thi
 India needs a cryogenic engine to launch payloads of up to 5 tonnes
 ye bhavishya ke prasaaran, doorsanchaar or antariksh anusandhan ke liye behad jaruri he or agar ye prakshepan sahi rahata to bharat duniya kaa chatha aisa desh ban jaataa jo is tarah kii takanic se las he

 com / xedbmzspko The title track of Akshay Kumar's next film 'rustom' has been released
 'rustam vahi' naam ke is gane main akshay kumaar kii rustam pavari ke kirdaar main puri jarney kii jhalak dikhaai gai he
 Full of suspense and thrill, this song showcases many aspects of Rustampavari's life
 gane main 1950 ke dashak ke lifestil kii jhalak bhi dikhaai gai he
 This fast track has been voiced by Sukriti Kakkar and written by Manoj Muntashir
 tinu suresh desai ke nirdesan main bani yahfilmakeem nanaavati banaam maharashtra rajya ke cese par aadhaarit he
 In this film, Akshay plays the role of a Navy officer
 yah film rithik roshan starer film 'mohen jodaado' ke saath 12 agast ko relies hone ja rahi he
 Watch the title track of the film 'rustom' yah nishkarsh nikaalane main koi harj nahin he ki agle saal bengal ke chunaav main aapraadhik chhavi vaale pratyaashiyon ke bich hode hone vaali he
 Election promises have now reached scooty, petrol, house, land giving, through laptops, bicycles, its new limits may be seen in next year's assembly elections
 agle saal tak chunaavon main kaala dhan bahaane ke nae tareeke najar aaenge or vanshavaad kii raajnneeti kaa nayaa paracham lahraane lagegaa jo uttar pradesh kii panchayaton ke chunaavon tak aa gaya he
 It is easy to arrive at these results because in Bihar elections, the country's largest political party and its government not only missed a big chance to fix the elections but also did not do anything to make the methods that polluted the elections in a new way authentic
 Has left
 narendra modi or bijepi se apeksha to yah thi ki satta main aane ke baad yah party ailaania taur par chunaav sudhaar shuru karegi, kyonki vipaksh main rahakar na keval bijepi ne bhartiya loktantr main chunaavon kii gandagi ko samajha he balki ise saaf karne kii awaajon main sur bhi milaayaa he
 Ideally this work should have started with the elections in Maharashtra, Haryana and Jharkhand but if these elections were held early, it should have started from Bihar
 ek aam bhartiya matadaata chunaavon main yahi to chahta he ki use aparaadhiyon ko apana pratinidhi chunane par majaboor na kiya jaae
 Remember, in May last year, Modi's public rally at the Allahabad Parade Ground, in which he said that "the campaign to end criminalization will begin with politics as soon as it comes to power"
 sarkaar sabhi pratyaashiyon ke halafname supreme court ke saamne rakhkar maamalon kii sunwaayee karne or faisle sunaane ke liye kahegi
 Those found guilty will be subscribed and seats will be filled through the by-elections
 yahi kaam vidhansabha main hoga
 "modi also said enthusiastically that if convicted, he himself will face trial but the next parliament will be clean
 pataa nahin, vah koun-si bahumat kii kami he jisane modi ko yah prakriya shuru karne se roak rakhaa he
 However, the country knows that in the first phase of Bihar elections, most people with criminal image are in the fray with BJP tickets and after disclosing the sale of tickets to criminals in BJP, party MP R
K
 ke
 Singh has scolded the high command
 chunaavon kii nigahabaani karne vaali sanstha ediaar kaa aankada bataata he ki pehle charan ke chunaav main bijepi ke 27 pratyaashiyon main 14 par aapraadhik maamle hai
 We know that the BJP will also argue for criminal cases like Mulayam, Mayawati or Lalu to be politically motivated, but the expectation was that it would falsify this argument by starting the tradition of clean candidates
 laptop, cycilen, berogari bhatta aadi baantne ke chunavi vaadon par bharat main bahes loksabhaa chunaav se pehle hi shuru ho gai thi or bijepi is bahes kaa sakriy hissaa thi
 In July 2013, the Supreme Court ordered the Election Commission to set guidelines on election promises, saying that the bailout announced before the election digs the roots of clean elections
 bijepi ko satta main aane ke baad is sudhaar kii aguai kerani thi, lekin bihar ke chunaav main party ne scooter, makaan, petrol or jameen dene ke vaade karte hue is badi ukvamid ko dafan kar diya he ki bharat ke chunaav is 'rishwatakhori' se kabhi mukt ho sakenge
 Interestingly, the Supreme Court's order on populist declarations in elections came in Tamil Nadu on election promises like distribution of TV, mixer-grinder
 agle saal tamilnadu main phir chunaav hone hai is baar vahaan loklubhaavan ghoshnaaon kaa nayaa tevar najar aa saktaa he
 When the preparations for the Bihar election were in full swing this August, the government, by giving an affidavit in the Supreme Court, opposed bringing political parties under the purview of the information law
 yah ek aisa sudhaar tha jo chunaavon main kharch ko simit karne or partiyon kaa hisaab saaf-suthra karne kii raah khol saktaa tha
 Moving from here, steps could be taken to prevent transparency in election funds and the use of black money
 bijepi satta main aane se pehle iske paksh main thi lekin bihar kii taraf badhate hue usne khud ko un dalon kii jamaat main khadaa kar diya jo bhartiya chunaavon ko kaale dhan kaa daldal banaae rakhana chaahate hai
 In Bihar, cash has been caught everywhere and elections are believed that 25 percent of the seats are sensitive to the use of black money
 ab jabaki rajnatik shuchita par bauddhik naseehaten dene vaali party hi is kaalikh kii pairokaar he to achraj nahin ki kaale dhan kii nadi panchayat se lekar sansad tak berok bahegi
 The bjp's acumen over political reforms disappoints that, far from reforming, the party has started giving new definitions and authenticity to the politics of politics
 masalan india today ke pichley ank main amit shah ne desh ko parivaarwaad kii bhaajapai paribhaasha se parichit karaayaa
 If we do not agree that the victory in the elections is all about victory, then we have to accept that through the election of Bihar, all parties have given collective tribute to the hope of political reforms
 bihar chunaav kaa nateeja kuch bhi ho lekin bhartiya loktantr khud ko thik karne kaa ek bada mauka chook gaya he

 Pm Modi said that the child died due to the coming down of the cow's feet, i tell one thing which has not been told yet, when i was young there lived a family near our house, no children in that family
 Due to which there was a lot of tension
 lekin kaaphi umr ke baad ek santan kaa janm hua
 Modi said that at that time a cow used to come there, and used to eat something every day
 modi ne kaha ki ek baar vahaan maut ho gai or gaay ko kuch khilaa nahin paae
 Then that child once came under the foot of the cow, and he died
 bachche kii maut par gaay ne sharir tyagaamodi ne kaha ki duusare din subah hi wo gaay unke ghar ke saamne khadi ho gai, usne kisi ke ghar ke saamne roti nahin khai, us parivaar se bhi roti nahin khai
 At that time, the tears of the cow were continuously flowing, that cow could not eat or drink anything for several days
 puure mohalle ke logon ne kaaphi koshish kii par gaay ne kuch nahin khaaya, or baad main us gaay ne apana sharir tyaag diya
 The cow did this in repentance of the death of a child
 lekin aaj log gaay ke naam par hi kisi kii hatya kii ja rahi he, kisi ko kanoon apane haath main lene kaa haq nahin he
 The country will have to walk on the path of non-violence
 Mohammad said that even if there is an accident, people get off on killing each other
 gaay kii raksha, gau kii bhakthi mahatma gandhi, vinoba ji se badhkar koi nahin kar saktaa he
 The country will have to follow the same path
 modi ne kaha ki vinoba ji ne jivan bhar gau raksha ke liye kaam karte rahe, main unase bhi mila bhi tha

 According to the Ramayana in Thailand, Sita was the daughter of Ravana, who was buried in the ground by Ravana after a prophecy
 bhavishyavaanee main kaha gaya tha ki 'yahi ladki teri maut kaa kaaran banegi'
 Later Goddess Sita was found to Janak
 yahi kaaran tha ki ravan ne kabhi bhi devi sita ke saath bura bartaav nahin kiya
 Ravana had knowledge of Vedas and Sanskrit
 wo sam veda main nipun tha
 He composed works like Shivtandava, Yudhisha Tantra and Prakutha Kamadhenu
 sam veda ke alaava use baaki teenon vedon kaa bhi gyaan tha
 Not only this, he also had mastery in the path
 pad path ek tarika he vedon ko padhane kaa
 Ravana was also fond of music
 rudra veena bajaane main ravan ko haraana lagbhag naammumkin tha
 Whenever Ravan was upset he used to play Rudra Veena
 itnaa hi nahin ravan ne vylan bhi banaaya tha jise ravanahatha kehete the
 It is still played in Rajasthan today
 ravan ko sangeet kaa bhi shauq tha
 It was almost impossible to defeat Ravana in playing the Rudra Veena
 ravan jab bhi pareshaan hota wo rudra veena bajaata tha
 Not only this, Ravana also made a violin which was called Ravanahatha
 aaj bhi rajasthan main ise bajaayaa jaataa he

 adhikanshat: carbon or oxigen se bana safed vaaman tara dhire-dhire thanda hota he or anant kaal tak antariksh main bhatakta he
 Bart Dunlap, a graduate student and research team at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, said, 'the final image is a thousand times more blurred than any other white Vamana star orbiting a neutron star and 10 more than a known white Vamana star Multiplication should be more blurred, but this is not visible
 've aage kehete hai, 'yadi vahaan koi shwet vaaman he or nishchit taur par he, to vah atyant thanda hona chahie
 Researchers have calculated that the white Vamana will not be colder than 3,000 degrees Kelvin (2,700 degrees Celsius)

 In fact, after Nitish Kumar aligned back with the BJP, he started running the government at the state level quite comfortably
 lekin centre se jo unki ummid or apeksha thi, khaskar bihar ko lekar or apane raajnneetik bhoomika ko lekar, vah kahin se bhi mukkamal hoti nahin dikh rahi thi
 CM Nitish felt that the BJP was not giving him much price and it may be that he did not get the seats according to his mind in the Lok Sabha elections
 isliye wo pradhanmantri narendra modi or bhaajapa ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah donon se khule taur par kabhi bhi naaraaz to nahin dikhe, magar kabhi utane prasann bhi nahin rahe
 Meanwhile, the Congress party also felt that if Nitish returned to the Grand Alliance, once again the Congress could not only return to Bihar politics, but also achieved the goal of winning more seats in the Lok Sabha elections as well
 can go
 lekin sabko maaloom tha ki iske liye rajd adhyaksh lalu yadav kaa raji hona or unka samarthan hona donon zaruri he
 No government can be formed without him
 haa, lekin prashanth kishor ne jo bhi baatcheet kii or us baatcheet main sarkaar banane kii sthiti main tejasvi ke liye koi bhoomika sarkaar main nahin dikh rahi thi kyonki wo bhi railway hotel maamle main chargeshited ho chuke the
 The Congress party was also not in favor of making a person the Deputy Chief Minister after the charge sheet was filed
 yahi ek aisa kaaran tha jo lalu yadav ko nagavar guzara or unhone is puure muhim main kabhi zyaada utsukata nahin dikhaai
 Apart from this, Lalu Yadav was also aware of the increasing popularity of Tejashwi Yadav
 unhen maaloom ho gaya tha ki jab unhen sahyogiyon kaa saath mil rahaa he, tejasvi ko bhi sabhi siem candidet phase ke rup main dhire-dhire sweekaaryata mil rahi he to phir vah dobaaraa in pachadon main nahin funsana chaahate the
 This is the reason Lalu Yadav was ready to go to the polls afresh
 nitish kumaar ke us prastaav par kaam karke vah apana raajnneetik qabr nahin khodna chaahate the
 Apart from this, most people in Lalu Yadav's family were saddened by Nitish Kumar's attitude
 nitish ke ravaiye se khaaskar rabari devi dukhit thim or unhone bhi aise prastaav ko maanane se bhi asahmati jataa di thi
 Meanwhile, the leaders of Bihar BJP had become aware of this conversation that what is political politics in Bihar is cooking
 bihar main pak rahi raajnneetik khichdi kaa andaaza hone ke baad bijepi netaaon ne apane party alaakaman ko is baat se avgat kara diya tha
 The BJP leadership of Bihar had also realized that going without Nitish Kumar in the elections could prove to be a costly deal
 yahi vajah he ki pradhanmantri narendra modi or mukhyamantri nitish kumaar bich barabari par sahmati bani
 The Shiv Sena, the largest old ally of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) at the Center, has now set aside its path and has decided to go it alone instead of going with the BJP in the Lok Sabha and state assembly elections to be held next year in 2019
 Has decided
 agle saal se bhaajapa kaa saath chhodkalakele chunaav ladane kaa elaan karne vaali shivasenaane mangalvaar ko apni rashtriya kaaryakarini kii baithak mangalvaar ko mumbai ke varli main enessi ground main hui
 Aditya Thackeray was elected Shiv Sena leader
 aditya abhi yuva sena ke adhyaksh bhi hai
 Being elected 'shiv Sena leader' means coming to number two position in the party
 'shivasena netaa' kaa pad party pramukh ke baad sabase bada pad hota he
 The person holding this post can also work to formulate the policies of the party
 is tarah se aditya ko party main number do kii pojishan mil gai he or un par 2019 main hone vaale do ahm chunaav kii jimmedaari rahegi
 She is the third generation of Thackeray in politics
 unhen pita uddhav ke alaava purv mukhyamantri manohar joshi, subhash desai, divakar ravate or anant geete jaise party ke diggajon kaa sahyog mil saktaa he
 Step into politics 7 years ago, 27-year-old Aditya is the son of party chief Uddhav Thackeray and grandson of Bal Thackeray
 21 saal kii umr main hi unhone raajnneeti main kadam rakh liye the
 In October 2010, the party's founder Bal Thackeray introduced his grandson to his supporters and presented a sword in a symbolic manner
 raajnneetik vanshavaad ko badhaava dene kii aalochana se pare thakare parivaar ne yuva aditya ko raajnneeti kii taiyaar plateform de diya
 He then established the Yuva Sena and opened units in Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Kerala, Bihar and Jammu and Kashmir
 haalanki shuruyaat main yuva sena ko gambhirtha se nahin liya gaya kyonki isamen anya shivasainikon ke ghar ke bete or unke dost shaamil ho rahe the
 Aditya is also a poet
 Aditya, who specializes in English, is himself an emerging poet and photographer
 2007 main unki kavitaaon kii siries 'maai thot in white and blike' naam se chhapi
 Later this year he wrote 8 songs for a private album
 unke likhe geeton ko suresh wadekar, shankar mahadevan, kailash kher or sunidhi chouhan ne apni aawaaj di
 The special thing is that the album was released by Amitabh Bachchan
 aditya apni kavitaayen likhane ke liye bothrum kaa istemaal karte hai or ise likhane ke baad mobile main seve karte hai
 He is a big fan of football
 unhone mumbai main antarrashtriya footbal match ke liye khel ke str par sudhaar karavaaya he, or is sambandh main khud kii ek pahchaan bhi banaai he
 In early 2010 in politics, he protested against the decision to include Rohinton Mistry's book 'sach a Long Journey' in Mumbai University and agitated across the state
 aditya us samay khaase surkhiyon main aae jab unhone mumbai main mal or restaraan ko 24 ghante khole jane kii vakaalat kii thi
 Aditya calls his politics social service
 haalanki unke aane ke baad party ne velentines de ke virodh ko khatm kar diya he
 As a young man, he has equal hold in everything
 vah soshal media par bhi sakriy rahete hai or rajya main bhaajapa ke saath saajhe kii sarkaar kaa khulkar virodh karte hai
 He has been meeting Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis with the party people under his leadership
 kai maukon par rajya sarkaar ke saath bhi dikhe hai
 Attempts to add youth The general election has more than a year to go and the party knows that it did not have the support of the youth as before, perhaps thinking that the party has given the number two position to the young Aditya, so that the youth support in time To be
 haalanki unke kuch nakaaratmak paksh bhi hai
 Aditya is not a good speaker like his grandfather, father and uncle, people are not much excited to hear his speeches at the party meeting
 lekin ek baat yah bhi he ki wo soshal media par lagaataar sakriy rahete hai or unki vahaan khaasi pakad bhi he
 There are 14 lakh 75 thousand followers on Twitter and keep tweeting in Marathi besides English
 gramin maharashtra ke bare main unki khaas pakad nahin he or vahaan ke muddon ko uthaane se bachate bhi hai
 Senior party leaders believe that with time, they will also get a grip on these issues and people will start focusing on them
 raajnneetik kii vansbel ke sahare aasaani se party main number 2 kii pojishan hasil karne vaale jamini str par kitna kaamyaab honge, yah vakt batayega

 Everyone who works in the film wants this award
 bhale hi bhartiya filmon ne ye award kabhi naa jeeta ho par kuch maukey aise bhi aae jab film ko auskar ke liye nominete kiya gaya
 In 2002, Aamir Khan's film 'lagaan' was nominated for an Oscar
 ye aisa pal tha jab logon ke bich film ko lekar cricket match jaisaa hi suspence ban gaya tha
 Everyone sat down on the TV to hear the announcement of the award before the sun came out in the morning
 tivi par auskar award kaa prasaaran bhartiya samyaanusaar din main hi hota he
 The film created panic all over the country with its release
 'lagaan' cricket match par aadhaarit thi jise lekar iskaa craij logon ke bich or zyada tha
 The God of 'lagaan' was no longer Kaka, Aamir's selection of his family's Saathfilm for the Oscars at the last moment was a matter of pride for the whole of India
 film aazaadee ke samay angrejon dwaara kiye gaye atyaacharon or bhartiya nagarikon ke sangharsh or balidaal ko rekhaankit karti thi
 People saw it in their emotions and also everyone wanted the film to win an Oscar
 film kaa sabakuch shreshth tha
 Whether it was the melodious music composed by AR Rahman, the casting of the film or the script of the film, it was widely appreciated
 'lagaan' filmpramiyon, cricketpremiyon or deshpramiyon teenon ke liye ek ahm mahatv rakhti he
 It was Ashutosh Gowarikar's amazing that he combined cricket with patriotism in the film
 lagaan main jiti nahin haari thi aamir kii team, film main hui thi ye mistakespilma auskar award jeetne main safal nahin ho pai lekin film ne logon ke dilon main hameshaa ke liye ek sammanjanak sthaan paa liya
 Even today, when the film comes on TV on the occasion of Independence Day and Republic Day, people do not give up the temptation to see it again
 vaise to desh ke kai kalakaaron ko auskar award mil chukaa he par bhartiya cinema abhi tak is sammaan kii kami mahasoos kar rahaa he
 Lagaan was the film that was closest to ending the drought

 master blaster ne international cricket main 20 saal puure kar liye, lekin phens kah rahe hai ki dil abhi bharaa nahin
 Those who have requested Sachin to play for a long time include those celebrities whom the world considers famous
 sab par baari pade sachinachaahe shahrukh khan hon yaa salmaan khan
 Amitabh Bachchan or Mukesh Ambani
 yaa phir raajnneeti ke yuvaraj rahul gandhi
 It is heavy on all these, the personality of Sachin Tendulkar is overshadowed
 mahanayake ke bhi naikaduniya jise mahanayake maanati he, wo bhi sachin tendulkar ko apana nayak maanata he
 That is, the master blaster is the hero of the great hero
 hamaare ird-gird sitare kai hai, lekin aisa sitara sirf ek he, jise tamaam sitare sabase bada sitara maanate hai
 Star of the Millennium Amitabh Bachchan knows that Sachin Tendulkar's fan following is more than that in this cricket-crazy world
 jis shakhsiyat ke aage mahanayake amitabh bachchan tak khud ko chota mahasoos karte hai, uske bare main koi kya baat kare, lekin sachin fain club main shaamil bade naam amitabh bachchan par aakar khatm nahin hote
 The long list of loved ones is as long as Sachin's century list
 duniya lata mangeshkar ko sangeet kii devi maanati hai, lekin lata mangeshkar ko lagata he ki agar duniya main koi cricket kaa devtaa he, to wo sirf sachin tendulkar hai
 Lata Mangeshkar wants to see Sachin Tendulkar play cricket for the next 10 years
 karodon phens ke dilon kii awaz bhi yahi he, lataji aapaki duaen rang laayen or sachin hameshaa isi tarah ran barasaate rahen
 Sachin is the biggest iconsachin Tendulkar is the biggest icon of India
 sachin kii fain folowing bollywood ke kisi bhi sitare se zyada he
 This is to say Shahrukh Khan, the king of Bollywood
 badshaah khan sachin ke bahut bade fain hai, to duusari taraf aamir khan sachin ko jeniyas maanate hai
 Sachin and Aamir are also good friends, but this friendship started in 1988
 bachapan main hi dikhaai pratibhamumbai ke breabourne stadium main aamir shooting kar rahe the
 It was on this ground that the young Mumbai players were practicing the net
 us vakt aamir ne ek 15 saal ke bachche ko banting karte hue dekha
 With that watch, he became crazy about that child
 sachin shot khelte ja rahe the or har shot aamir kapil or vengskar se is bachche kii tariff kiye ja rahe the
 The child was none other than the master blaster Sachin Tendulkar
 ye us vakt kii baat he, jab sachin team india main shaamil nahin hue the
 And all the cricketers of the world are believing that Sachin's career can be prolonged, but there was a time when no one was sure that 16-year-old Sachin would last more than two-four years in international cricket
 dilachasp baat ye he ki sachin ke sabase bade fain kapildev kii raay bhi kuch aisi hi thi
 All the bowlers from all over the world gave up their arms and time also became the slave of Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar
 16 saal kii umr main test kii duniya main kadam rakhane vaale sachin ne international cricket main kaise 20 saal puure kar liye, ye kisi ko yaad nahin rahaa
 India's Cricketer of the Century Kapil Dev also believes that he was not sure that Sachin would be able to play so long
 har daur ke khiladiyon kaa mila pyarwander bvoy, jeniyas, master blaster
 Sachin Tendulkar has had many names in different times
 sachin shaayad duniya ke iklaute aise cricketer he, jinhen har daur ke khilaadiyon ne sir ankhon par bithaaya
 Many people achieved a different place in the history of cricket, but as far as Sachin reached, no one else could reach there
 cricket kii duniya jinke aage sazda karti he, wo bhi sachin ke karishme ko salaam karte hai
 Everyone knows that no other batsman in the cricket world is bigger than Sir Don Bradman, but when Bradman reached the end of his age, when he saw the youngster playing Sachin, he saw his image in him
 richards ne bhi kii tariphalambe arase tak duniya bhar ke gendbaazon ko rulaane vaale vivian richards ballebaazi ke saath apni akad ke liye pahachaane jate rahe, lekin sachin kaa zikr aate hi richards kaa andaaz badal jaataa he
 Richards says Sachin is unmatched
 jab tak cricket kaa khel rahegaa, tab sachin kaa naam rahegaa
 Not only the old-time batsmen but the bowlers are also fans of Sachin
 denis lily kii emref pes academy main sachin ko daakhila to nahin mila tha, lekin sachin kii batting ke bare main lily kehete hai ki agar mujhe sachin ko gendbaazi kerani hoti, to main helmet pahanakar gendbaazi karata
 Even respected people found Sachin to be God, then Sachin became the most dreaded dream for anyone
 team india ke captain mahendra singh dhoni maanate hai ki sachin jaisaa khilaadi sadi ek baar hi paidaa hota he
 Opponents also have to come up with new words to praise Sachin
 cricket itihaas main shaayad koi or khilaadi hoga, jise sachin kii tarah apane virodhiyon kaa itnaa sammaan hasil hua ho

 So their ghazals and nudges are present with their emotional echoes: everyone has the grief to make the sea dry, that the game is finished dipping installments
 agar kishtiyon ko dubona khel he to mahanagareey nissangata or nissangata se paidaa hua akelaapan kavi kii bechaini kaa bis banataa haih seene main jalan ankhon main tufaan-sa kyon he / is shahar main har shaks pareshaan-sa kyon he
 In Urdu poetry, expatriation has been in every phase
 gaalib kii shaayari main 'kyon' baar-baar ubharta he or wo har baar vidambnaaon par sawaal khadey karata he
 When Shaharyar says - why is every woman upset? So they embellish the 'metro culture' with full vigor
 shehryaar nae samay ke shaayar hai
 Modernism creates sense, by saving poetry
 shehryaar kii jadidiyat urdu shaayari se thodi bhinn bhi he
 There is synthesis and generality here
 najmon main wo samay, mrityu, jivan, vyarthta jaise tatwon par likhte vakt kahin sufiana rang bikherte hai to kahin aadhyatmik hone lagate hai: dhyaan kii purpech galiyon or guzargahon pe, gyaan ke faile hue saharaa kii jaanib, chand saae ja rahe hai
 Shaharyar treads the rhythm of life in his ghazals and nazams in such a way that poetry, time, and humanism and nature become the essence of life
 beshak unki shaayari main kishtiyaan, khwab, sairab, dariyaa, raat jaise pratik baar-baar ripet hote hai
 Despite this, the poetry of Shaharyar is so fine, subtle, meaningful that the creation and composition of the rhythm and feeling is nothing but the poetry of the city
 ek baichaiyn samay main koi bhi samvedansheel shaayar apni vyakulata ko vyarth nahin ganvaata
 Shaharyar makes his distraught world a world of Ash'ar: In the slavery, bring a new face, that is, in this stagnant time, create a chaos
 wo kashmakash paidaa karte bhi hai lekin bhav vahi vinamrata se bharaa
 The tone is the same Nafees
 andaaj vahi shysta
 Shaharyars look for a compound in every lion
 do misaron ke bich vichaar kii ek duniya ko basaate hai
 Be so conscious of alphas that no words are loud or loud! His poetry is a poem of dreams, memories, gloom and aspirations
 sairab, samandar or kishtiyon ko 
 If we look at it a bit, then the duality of the mind of the poet and the appearance of the deeds are seen
 vicitra baat he ki shehryaar kii gajalen padho to ve ghazal ke shaayar prathit hote hai or unki najmen padho to ve najmon ke shaayar dikhte hai
 That is, he is a strong poet in every sense
 najmon main unhone beshak zyada kalpanasheel hokar apane bhav vyakt kiye hai
 Only Shaharyar can express loneliness in such a wonderful way: the vendors selling full bottles of silence, standing again under my window, and making voices
 gulzaar sampadit shehryaar suno shaayari kii shandaar kitaab he, jisamen apane samay kii smritiyaan, sapane, talash, talshiyaan jigyaasa, kalpanaaen or vartmaan se jirah gahari anubhutiyon ke saath jajb hai
 
 
 
 yah nae samay kii nai shaayari he
 This review has been written before the death of Shaharyar

 The electoral movement in Delhi is in full swing
 chunavi abhiyaan khatm hone main sirf do din bache hai or aise main tamaam raajnneetik dal votaron ko lubhaane ke liye har sambhav hatkandaa apana rahe hai
 Local ethnic equations are also emerging in the middle of this political sugbugabat which may affect the results in many assembly constituencies
 dakshini dilli kaa shahpur jat gaanv ek samay jat-bahul ilaaka tha
 In the last few years, a large number of outsiders have come and settled here
 enditivi ne jab is gaanv kaa daura kiya to paaya ki bahari logon ke yahaan basane kii vajah se dakshini dilli ke is gaanv kaa saamaajik maahaul badal gaya he
 If nothing has changed, it is the caste identity of the villagers that still remains important here
 gaanv nivasee naresh dagar maanate hai ki agar ek jati kaa ummidavaar chunaav maidan main khadaa hota he to uske prati judaav mahasoos karnaa swabhaavik he
 He claims that 40 per cent of the people of the village can vote on the basis of caste, that is, like every time, caste identity will be important in elections and the effect will be seen
 shahpur jat ke pandit harichandra vatsa kaa janm 70 saal pehle isi gaanv main hua
 It is said that in the last few years, the importance of caste has decreased slightly
 unki nazar main is baar shahpur jat gaanv main voting pattern badalata dikhaai de rahaa he
 Both Harijan and Jat community votes will be split
 jaankaron ke mutabik 2013 se pehle bijepi ko punjabi khatri or vaisya samudaay kaa samarthan zyada miltaa tha, jabaki obisi or daliton main congress kii pakad zyada majboot thi
 But Aam Aadmi Party's entry into Delhi politics in 2013 changed the old caste equations
 research sanstha centre for science and dewelping societes kaa aankalan he ki dilli ke votaron main brahman vot 12%, jat vot 7-8%, punjabi khatri vot 7%, rajput 7%, vaisya samaaj 6%, jabaki dalit vot 14% he
 Political analyst Sanjay Kumar says that the vote of these ethnic communities will affect the voting pattern of elections
 unka daawa he ki 2015 ke chunaavon se pehle jaateey samudaayon ke rukh main badlaav aa rahaa he jiskaa asar nateezon par padegaa
 However, if the young voters of the village believe that employment and development are more important to them than caste
 vah chaahate hai ki nai sarkaar yuvaaon kii ummiido or aakankshaon par khara utre or log jatigat pahchaan se upar uthakar matdaan karen
 That is, youth want politics of change and development
 ab yah dekhnaa ahm hoga ki dilli ke chunaavon main jati kaa asar kis had tak zamin par chunavi nateezon ko prabhavit kar paaegaa

 12 people have died in Kerala due to the disease
 nipah virus jaanwaron se insaanon main failata he, jabaki ek insaan se duusare insaan main failane ke bhi saboot mili hai
 The virus was first detected in Malaysia's pig parents
 phir yah silligudi, pashchim bengal main 2001 main or dobaaraa 2007 main paaya gaya
 Now the virus has been found in four districts of Kerala - Kozhikode, Mallapuram, Kannur and Wayanad

 unhone kaha ki 90 fisadi maamalon main yah beemaari do saptaah ke baad saamne aati he
 Vikas Maurya, head of the Department of Pulmonology at Fortis Hospital (shalimar Bagh, New Delhi), said that until the body's immunity starts fighting the virus, it can infect people for at least 10-15 days in separate rooms

 chini smertphone mekar shaomi ke bajet smartphone Redmi Note 7 ke liye bhartiya customers main kaaphi utsaah he
 People are constantly asking about this on Twitter
 lekin aisa lagata he ki is maheene bhi ye smartphone bharat main launch nahin hoga
 a few days ago a 'fake' invite was being shared which was published by 91 Mobiles
 daawa kiya gaya ki Redmi Note 7 bharat main 12 farvari ko launch hoga
 but it's not like that
 reports ke mutabik bharat main Redmi Note 7 launch hone main abhi kuch samay hai or mumkin he ye march main launch hoga
 However, on Twitter, the company released the teaser much earlier with 48 megapixel hashtag
 lekin date company ne tab bhi nahin bataaya tha
 This smartphone has been launched in China only last month
 bharat main isasmartphonke der se launch hone kaa matlab ye bhi ho saktaa he ki company diarect bharat main Redmi Note 7 Pro karegi
 However, there is also a fact that last year Xiaomi launched the first smartphone of the year in India on January 22, so there is no denying that this smartphone will be launched later this month
 baharhaal Redmi Note 7 Pro ke bare main baat karen to is smartphone se jude liks or reports lagaataar aa rahi hai
 Apart from Redmi Note 7, it will be that Sony's sensor will be used for 48 megapixel camera and this will make photography much better
 reports ke mutabik china main isi maheene Redmi Note 7 Pro bhi launch hagoga
 However, the company has not confirmed this, so the confusion remains intact
 launch se pehle hi Redmi Note 7 Pro kii jo jaankaree saamne ai he usamen SONY IMX 586 sensor ke bare main he jo Note 7 Pro main diya jayega
 Samsung's ISOCESS sensor has been given in Note 7
 haalanki dekhne main donon ek jaise hi honge dizin main koi badlaav kii ummid nahin he
 There will be a glass back and there will also be a water drop
 is smartphone main 6
 a 3-inch full HD Plus display is expected
 iske alaava isame qolkom snapadragon 675 chipset bhi die jane kii ummid he
 Talking about the possible price of Redmi Note 7 Pro, it can be from Rs 14,500 to Rs 16,000 in India
 is keemat par bharat main ab Redmi Note 7 Pro kii raah aasaan nahin hogi
 Because Oppo K1 has been launched at almost the same price and it also has an under display fingerprint scanner
 isliye jaise Note 7 Pro logon ko 48 megapixl camere se lubhaayega, thik usee tarah se Oppo K1 logon ko under disple fingerprint scinar ke saath lubhaayega
 There is likely to be a tough competition between these two smartphones
 desh ke 16wein loksabhaa chunaav main soshal netwarking cites kaa jamkar istemaal kiya gaya

 For example, the tweet of BJP leader Narendra Modi's victory or the tweet to visit his mother for blessings or the tweet that Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi took responsibility for the defeat, people gave a lot of reactions to all these
 modi kii jeet par kiye gaye twit ko mahaj kuch hi ghanton main 50,000 se bhi zyada baar retweet kiya gaya

 In this year, the number of internet users has reached 234 crore in the year 2014
 yahi kaaran rahaa is baar ke chunaav main soshal media kaa khub istemaal hua
 Especially those who used social media more and could not see the results of the general election on TV
 sena ke naujavaanon ne bhi soshal cites par apane netaaon kaa jamkar prachaar-prasar kiya he
 Many people, including Lucknow Vishal Tiwari, Lokesh Singh, Brajesh Singh, Gappu, Neeraj Talreja, Kamal Kishore Pandey, have vigorously promoted their leader on social sites
 yahaan tak in cites par agar inke netaaon kaa jaraa bhi virodh kiya gaya to inke dwaara turant kaayade kaa jawaab bhi diya gaya
 All these people have strongly promoted their leaders on whatsapp

 The growing use of social media, youth participation in it and the debate on politics here shows that this platform has now become much larger and wider

 com / nhvqxuddtt Dalit and Other Backward Classes (OBC) voters play an important role in the victory of a candidate in Nagpur Lok Sabha seat
 bijepi or congress agle maheene hone vaale chunaavon main in samudaayon ke vot hasil karne ke liye kadi mashkkat kar rahi hai
 Political analysts believe that Dalits, who have supported the BJP in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, especially the newborns, may consider another option this time
 kendriya mantri nitin gadakari nagpur se maujuuda saansad hai
 Congress has fielded former BJP MP Nana Patole as its candidate against Gadkari
 nagpur loksabhaa kshetra ke kai hisson main dalit baudhon kaa acha-khaasaa prabhaav he
 Nagpur is the headquarters of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the ideological guide of the BJP

 Babasaheb Bhim Rao Ambedkar, who played an important role in the making of the Indian Constitution, adopted Buddhism in 1956 at the same place with thousands of his supporters
 is seat par loksabhaa chunaavon ke pehle charan main yani 11 april ko matdaan hoga
 According to analyst pti-language, what the analyst believes, Sukhdev Thorat, former chairman of the University Grants Commission (UGC), says that this time there is an anti-bjp trend among Dalits
 haalanki, yah vot congress-rakanpa gathbandhan, prakaash ambedkar ke vanchit bahujan aghadi (vibie) or mayawati kii basapa ke bich bant jaaenge
 He said that the only way to keep these votes from being divided is to unite
 baharhaal, nagpur uttari vidhansabha seat se bijepi vidhayak milind maane thoraat ke akalan se asahmat dikhe
 He claimed, this time the percentage of Dalit Buddhist votes in favor of Gadkari will go up to 27 percent as compared to only three-four percent in the last Lok Sabha election
 sirf vikaas kaaryon ke kaaran aisa nahin hoga, balki ambedkarwaadiyon ke saath bijepi kaa sambandh bhi ek bada kaaran hoga
 Buddhists have started believing in BJP
 bijepi vidhayak ne kaha ki gadakari dikshabhumi ko baraabar ahmiyat dete hai
 Mane said that Dalits, Muslims and other minorities can easily contact Gadkari

 dalit or obisi vot bantane ke sawaal par vah kahati hai, 'ham bahujan vot ko congress or bijepi se waapas laane ke liye chunaav maidan main utre hai
 Both these parties have been winning with the help of Bahujan vote, but they are cheating them
 isliye ham bahujan vot unase waapas laane ja rahe hai
 According to an estimate, more than 50 percent of the voters in Nagpur region are obcs
 inamen mukhyat: kunbi or taili samudaayon ke voter hai
 The remaining 15-20 per cent of the voters are Dalits, who are both Hindus and Buddhists

 Before the match against Pakistan, if the history of World Cup was encouraging the team of India, then before the match against South Africa on February 22, Dhoni's team would be looking at the pages of history
 is ravivaar ko world cap phir ek aise mukaable kaa gavaah banegaa jahaan ek team duusari team se kabhi bhi world cap main nahin jiti or is baar baikfoot par team india he
 Despite Team India's big win over Pakistan, big cricket pundits and knowledgeable bets are on South Africa
 aisa kyon he, aaiye jaanane kii koshish karte hai-record bana sirdardadakshin africa ke khilaaf bharat world cap main pichley 23 saalon se sangharsh kar rahaa he
 This is the only team in the whole world that India has never defeated in the World Cup
 donon desh 1992, 1999 or 2011 worldcup main aamane-saamne hue lekin bharat ek baar bhi dakshin africa se jeet nahin paaya
 Melbourne's Lion is South Africa's record in South Africa is better than host Australia's
 yahaan khele kul 9 maichon main se dakshin africa ne 7 main jeet hasil kii he jabaki 2 main use haar mili he
 Here his win percentage is around 78
 vahiin team india ne yahaan khele 18 muqablon main se keval 8 jite hai, jabaki 10 muqablon main use haar kaa munh dekhnaa padaa
 Here India's winning percentage is only 44
 dakshin africa ballebaajon kaa dabadabaadakshin africa ke khilaaf team india ke top order main sabase zyada 115 kaa strike rate shikhar dhawan kaa he
 While at number two is Ravindra Jadeja who has a strike rate of 108 against South Africa
 iske alaava viraat kohli hon, captain dhoni yaa phir suresh raina sabhi kaa strike rate dakshin africa ke khilaaf 80 se kam yaa usase thodaa zyada he
 At the same time, the South African batting order is seen only twenty-one against India
 captain abi divilliars or tufaani ballebaaj david miller kaa strike rate 100 se zyada kaa he to team ke baaki ballebaajon kaa strike rate bhi 100 ke kareeb hi he
 Opener Quinton de Kock has scored 3 centuries in 3 matches against India
 iske alaava hashim amala, faif du plasis or jepi dumini bhi is formet ke behtareen ballebaajon main se ek hai
 The biggest difference between the teams of India and South Africa is the dangerous and fast bowler Dale Steyn
 duniya main sabase behtareen strike rate rakhane vaale sten bharat ke khilaaf har 25veen gend par wicket chatakaate hai to unke saathi morne morkel 26 kaa strike rate rakhte hai
 Although India's Mohammed Shami has a better strike rate of 18 against South Africa, he is far behind Steyn and Morkel in speed and sharpness
 varnon philendar bhi team india kaa imtihaan lene ko taiyaar honge
 Apart from this, South African bowlers have also proved to be much better in the death overs bowling
 haalanki sten bharat ke khilaaf match se baahar rah sakate hai
 Fielding can also put Farkran, in addition to making runs, few teams of the world are able to compete against African Lions
 pakistan ke khilaaf team india jis ek department main kamjor dikhaai di wo team kii fielding hi thi
 Sachin Tendulkar has also issued a warning to Team India regarding this department of cricket
 fielding ke dauraan die gaye kuch extra ran yaa ballebaaji ke dauraan kharaab running bitwin da wicket puure match kaa najaara badal sakati he, aise main dakshin africa se is morche par bhi kadi chunauti milegi

 24 may kii dopaher ko america raashtrapati ke ghar white house se ek letters jari hota he
 The letter was named after North Korean dictator Marshall Kim Jong Un
 khat donald trump kii taraf se tha
 It was written in the letter that the meeting in Singapore on June 12 is currently being canceled
 idhar kim ko khat miltaa he
 Meanwhile, journalists from all over the world are taken to a particular place in North Korea after a few hours
 phir un patrakaron ke saamne ek ke baad ek kai dhamaake hote hai
 But after the breakup of Trump and Kim, these blasts were completely different from all the previous ones
 kim ne nibhaayaa vaadauttar korea kii newclear site par dhamaake hue
 These blasts were on one side
 duusari taraf wo letters bam
 On the one hand, fulfilling its promise of North Korea and on the other side of America retracting its promise
 kamaal kaa ittefaq tha ye
 On 24th of May, this letter of America first appears on Thursday
 or phir uske kuch hi ghante baad uttar korea ke bamon kii factory ko barood se udaati tasviren saamne aati hai
 We are talking about nuclear nuclear blast sites, they are not bomb blasts
 balki parmaanu bam banane vaali newclear site ko tabah karne ke liye kiye ja rahe dhamaake hai
 On the evening of May 24, North Korea destroyed its nuclear site as promised, in the presence of journalists around the world
 laga ab sab thik ho jayega
 But it did not happen
 tal gai mulakatbus haath or gale milane hi vaale the
 The clash of bombs was about to be resolved
 tisare vishwa yuddh kaa khatra talane hi vaala tha
 But only then
 ji haa
 Then comes the letter of US President Donald Trump at the last moment and everything ends for the moment
 vishwa shanti ke liye 12 june ko singapore main hone vaali trump or kim kii mulaakaat tal jaati he
 Trump canceled meeting Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump will not meet at the moment
 12 june ko singapore main hone vaali meeting radd ho gai he
 Kim Jong Un is angry at the cancellation of the meeting
 singapore main kim jong un ke saath hone vaali meeting ko radd karne ke peeche
 US President Donald Trump has argued that Kim is still making provocative talks
 aise main is vakt baatcheet kaa koi matlab nahin he
 The US vice-president was told that according to public opinion Trump was angry with Kim for calling US vice-president Mike Pins an 'idiot'
 kim ne haal hi main mike ko bevakoof kaha tha
 Indeed, US Vice President Mike Pins made a statement in the past that if North Korea is not deterred by the testing of nuclear bombs, then the US will not shy away from adopting the Gaddafi policy against it
 is bayaan ke baad kim ne america up-raashtrapati ko bevakoof bolaa tha
 Kim's minister had given the statement that this new conversation between the two countries started with the statement of North Korean minister Cho Son-hui
 jinhone amareeki up-raashtrapati mike pence ko trump kaa bayaan dohraane ko lekar unhen siyaasi kathputli qaraar diya tha
 In fact, US National Security Advisor John Bolton had said before he took office that talks with him until North Korea destroys all its nuclear and chemical weapons have no meaning
 or trump kim se milakar apana vakt jaaya karenge
 Trump changed his attitude; Trump quickly changed his stance and made it clear by writing this letter that you talk about your nuclear capability but our nuclear weapons are very big and powerful, i pray to God never to use them
 Had to do
 libya model par vivamb america ko lagata he ki kim ko baatcheet ke liye libya model apnaanaa chahie
 Let me tell you that after the denuclearization process in 2003, Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi had to stop his nuclear program completely
 bas isi baat par uttar korea bhadak gaya tha
 He threatened America in his style
 libya se tulana par bhadkaa kimauttar korea ek parmaanu taaqat he jiske paas intercontinental belistic missile hai, jinhen thermoneuclear hathiyaaron par feet kar istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 In comparison, Libya made only a few devices
 kim ne saaf kaha ki wo wo apane saare parmaanu hathiyaaron ko kabhi khatm nahin karegaa
 Neither today nor tomorrow or agar parmaanu hathiyaaron ko khatm hi karnaa he to akele uttar korea kyon kare
 Why should America not also
 jisane saikadon kii taadaad main parmaanu hathiyaar bana rakhen hai
 However, despite this argument on both sides, the hope of negotiation is not completely lost yet
 agar aap is ahm mulaakaat ko karne ke liye apana man badalen to mujhe phone karne yaa chitthee likhane main sankoch na karen
 North Korea is extremely angry with Trump's changed move
 lekin baavjood iske usne doharaaya he ki wo america ke saath kootnithik prakriya kahin bhi or kabhi bhi shuru karne ko taiyaar he

 bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish ke raajnneetik hatya vaale bayaan ke baad se bihar kii raajnneeti main bhuuchaal aane ke saath-saath mukhyamantri ko naseehat dene kaa daur bhi shuru ho gaya he
 In a special conversation with Aaj Tak, BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi said that if he stays with the RJD and the Congress, he will definitely be killed politically
 aise main mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ko argedy or congress ke saath sambandho par punarvichaar karnaa chahie
 Reduction in Campaign Against Corruption IBJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi said that the way Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has aligned with RJD and Congress in Bihar, a campaign against corruption and crime cannot be conducted at any cost
 unhone kaha ki jabatak bihar main nitish kumaar bijepi ke saath milakar sarkaar chalaa rahe the tabatak bihar main bhrashtachariyon ke khilaaf lagaataar abhiyaan chalaaya gaya
 But ever since the Grand Alliance government was formed in Bihar, the campaign against the corrupt people has relaxed
 susheel kumaar modi ne kaha ki bihar kaa svarnim kaal us vakt tha jab bihar main jediu or bijepi kii sarkaar thi or saare vikaas ke kaary usee svarnim kaal main hue
 Sushil Kumar Modi said that whatever popularity Nitish Kumar gained is also a result of that period
 lalu he chaara ghotaale ke doshimodi bole ki argedy supremeo lalu prasad jo swany karodon rupee ke chaara ghotaalaa main sajayapta hai, argedy ke shashan kaal main kitne ghotaale hue, kitne mantriyon ko jail janaa padaa, kitnon ko apane pad se istipha tak dena padaa or congress ke bare main to kuch kehane kii zarurat hi nahin
 Sushil Kumar Modi said that in the way RJD and Congress do not allow Parliament to stand up against black money keepers, it is meaningless to expect the government of the Grand Alliance to campaign against corruption in Bihar
 susheel kumaar modi ne kaha ki agar nitish kumaar kii taraf se bijepi ke saath milane kaa prastaav aayaa to bijepi us prastaav par vichaar karegi

 Something similar happened with a young man named Neeraj and his family living in Indrapuri JJ Colony, Delhi
 niraj bike par savaar yatra kar rahaa tha, bike kaa naam aate hi speed ko jimmedaar tehraaya jaataa he lekin isaki speed bhi kam thi
 Well, no one can avoid Honi and Neeraj is suddenly attacked by a stray animal
 jaanavar ne niraj par sing se hamalaa kiya or vah sadak par gir gaya
 He was suffering with running blood
 jab tak aspataal le jaaya gaya doctoron ne use mrit ghoshit kar diya
 The family is in shock due to this death
 niraj ke bhai ne kaha ki aawaara jaanavar ke sing kii chot itani tej thi ki use uthne tak kaa mauqaa nahin mila
 Many times the administration was told by the people on the issues of the stray animal but the hearing was nothing and no response was received even after the complaint from the administration
 jiskaa khamiyaja aaj ek bhai ko khone se hua
 Neeraj was also affectionately called Golu by his family members, friends and relatives
 vah indrapuri je je caloni kaa rahane vaala tha
 Due to his death the father's shadow was taken away from the head of 3 children
 police ne bhi is dardanaak ghatana kii pushti kii he
 But no complaint has been made on behalf of the family
 niraj kii dardanaak maut kii jaankaree whatsap se lagaataar ilaake main fail rahi he
 It is also said in this that the horn injury of the stray animal was so severe that it did not even get a chance to get up
 ab is par sawaal khadey ho rahe hai ki is maut kaa jimmedaar koun he? koun he aawaara jaanwaron kaa maalik? dheron kii sankhya main ghoomane vaali aawaara jaanavar se ilaake main dar kaa maahaul he
 But due to fear of bullying, people are avoiding saying anything on camera

 gujarat kii ek rajyasabha seat kaa dilachasp chunaav ab apane aakhri padaav par he
 Thanks to 57 mlas of the state, Ahmed Patel, the political adviser to Congress President Sonia Gandhi, who is looking forward to the Rajya Sabha, faces a tough challenge
 achaanak shankarasingh waghela kii baghaavat or phir 6 vidhayakon ke party chhod jane ke bazhamad patelki raah main bijepi main kaante bicha die
 Vaghela's Samadhi and Congress MLA Balwant Singh were fielded by BJP in front of Ahmed
 isliye party ne apane 44 vidhayakon ko karnataka kii congress sarkaar ke bharose bangaloru ke resort main rakh diya, lekin vahaan iti kii red ne hangaamaa khadaa kar diya
 Meanwhile, the party could not overcome NOTA from the electoral process despite the struggle
 aise main 8 agast ko matdaan ke din se pehle raakhi kaa tyohaar aa gaya he
 These mlas must go to Gujarat to vote
 congress ke 44 vidhayakon kaa bangaleru main netritv kar raheshakti singh gohilne ajtak se baatcheet main kaha, ek baat tay he ki ham dilli nahin gujarat jaaenge
 This false news is being spread that our mlas will go to Delhi to meet Soniaji
 bijepi hi yah galat khabar failaa rahi he ki hamaare vidhayak nota par vot karenge
 With this, he said, i request the news channels to run on-record news
 main or sabhi vidhayak abhi bangaloru main hai
 We have 44 mlas united and will win Ahmed Patel
 haalanki sutron kii maane, congress ko apane vidhayakon ke tuutane kaa dar ab bhi sata he, yahi vajah he ki philhal party matdaan se pehle in vidhayakon ko akelaa nahin chhodana chaahati
 The party feels that these mlas are also concerned about their families
 isi bich matdaan se ek din pehle rakshabandhan kaa tyohaar bhi he
 That is why the party has now planned to shoot two targets with one stone
 sutron ke mutabik, rakshabandhan ke din sabhi vidhayakon ko gujarat ke anand sthit pradesh congress adhyaksh bharat singh solanki ke resort main rakhaa jayega
 The families of these mlas will also be called there
 darasal, raksha bandhan ke agle din hi rajyasabha kaa chunaav he
 The distance to the polling place is only one and a half hours from Anand, so everyone will leave together on the morning of polling
 saath hi unke parijanon ko chhot rahegi ki wo resort main ruken yaa jaaen
 The party feels that due to this, there will be no worry of the family in the minds of the mlas and they will vote for the Congress
 party ne philhal vaqt or vidhayakon kii yatra kaa detail gupt rakhaa he or aadhikarik taur par vah is par kuch nahin bolnaa chaahati
 In such a situation, one can say that Congress mlas will celebrate Raksha Bandhan in Anand, Gujarat, by pledging to be bound in a bond to protect their Ahmed brother

 Clap for a weak hero in front of a strong villain

 That controversial statement by Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar about bjp's Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi was described by the main opposition party as a reflection of the frustration of the Congress and said that the Chief Minister of Gujarat will never become the Prime Minister of the country and if If he wants, Congress can provide him a place to distribute tea
 party ke pravaktaa prakaash javdekar ne kaha, congress netaa kaa yah bayaan us party kii ghatiya soch or hataasha kaa pratik he
 We can understand the frustration of the Congress and its leaders, but by making such low-level statements, they are insulting the tea sellers and all the poor sections

 He said that the truth of the definite defeat in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections has killed the Congress and its leaders

 unhone kaha, ‘‘raashtragan ke saath tirange ko unki salaami ne parade ke dauraan maujuud sabhi logon ke bich deshbhakti ke jazbe ko prerit kar diya

 dilli main congress kaa sabase bharosemand cheharaa thim shilamakan ke istife ke baad shila ko saunpi thi kamanaloksabhaa chunaav main congress ko duusare number par laayaa15 saal tak shila ne dilli main bahaai vikaas kii gangacongress kii diggaj netaa or dilli kii teen baar mukhyamantri raheen shila dikshit kaa shanivaar ko nidhan ho gaya
 After Ajay Maken's resignation, Sheila, 81, was handling the command of Delhi Pradesh Congress
 shila loksabhaa chunaav main congress ko seat bhale na dilaa saki hon, lekin party ko tisare sthaan se duusare par laakar vidhansabha chunaav se pehle unhone ummiden jarur paidaa kar deen
 In such a situation, after his sudden demise, the leadership crisis has once again arisen in the Delhi Congress
 dilli main congress kaa sabase bharosemand cheharaa thim shilasheela dikshit dilli main congress kaa sabase bharosemand cheharaa thim
 He died at a time when the Congress, especially the Gandhi family, needed his advice the most
 congress sirf dilli main nahin balki desh main bhi apane sabase gambhir sankat se jujh rahi he
 At this time, Sheila Dixit's presence could have been instrumental in deciding the future course of the party
 dilli pradesh congress bhi unheen ke sahare apni khoi hui siyaasi jameen paane kii kavayad kar rahi thi
 After Sheila, who will be in command of the Congress? Neither the Congress nor the political experts are taking any risk to make such a prediction for this question
 maakan ke istife ke baad shila ko saunpi thi kamanaloksabhaa chunaav se ain pehle ajay maakan ne pradesh adhyaksh pad se istipha de diya tha
 After this, the top leadership of the Congress handed over the command of the State Congress once again to Sheila Dixit on the lines of 1998
 shila ne is jimmedaari ko bakhubi nibhaayaa or unhone loksabhaa chunaav main zyaadaatar netaaon kii ichha ke vipareet, aam aadmi party se loksabhaa chunaav main gathbandhan nahin kiya
 In the Lok Sabha elections, the Congress was brought in second place, though the Congress lost in the Lok Sabha elections, but the party rose from the third position to reach the second position
 congress ko 21 fisadi vot mili or dilli kii 7 main se 6 siton par party ke pratyaashiyon ko aam aadmi party se zyada vot mili
 Thus the main contest in Delhi was BJP vs Congress
 isse dilli main congress kaaryakartaaon main ek baar phir vaapasi kii aas jaagi thi
 It was believed that the Congress would contest the next assembly elections in 2020 under his leadership
 lekin ab party ke saamne sabase badi chunauti yahi he ki aakhir shila kaa uttaradhikari koun hoga? congress ke liye yah chunauti isliye bhi kaaphi badi he, kyonki is vakt na sirf congress kamjor ho chuki he balki gutbaji bhi isamen charam par he
 Sheila Dixit, the gangster of Bahá'í development in Delhi for 15 years, also considers the development work done in Delhi for 15 years from 1998 to 2013 as her opponents
 yahi vajah he ki party main unhen chunauti dene vaale netaa bhi janata ke bich jaakar shila ke naam par hi vot maangate rahe hai
 But now after Sheela has said goodbye to the world, this big weapon of Congress leaders has lost her edge
 maujuuda samay main dilli main aisa koi netaa nahin he jo shila ke uttaradhikari hone kaa daawa kar sake
 The current Dr
 ashok walia, ajay maakan, rajkumaar chouhan, arvinder singh lavali, parvej hashmi or haaron yusuf jaise netaa hai
 But filling the vacuum created in the Congress after Sheila's departure will be a very difficult challenge for these leaders

 Congress president Sonia Gandhi herself had to come forward to suppress the voices of protest that were being raised in place of Ashok Tanwar as state president

 Even if Sonia has taken over, it is not easy to end factionalism in the party
 bataa den ki congress haikaman haryana main jaateey santulan barkaraar rakhane main kaamyaab rahaa he
 Before the Haryana Assembly elections, the Congress has made a strategy to address 20% Dalits and 30% Jats
 haikaman ne ashok tanvar or kiran choudhary kii jodi ko hataakar kumari shailaja or hooda kii jodi ko haryana kii bagdor saunpi he
 Ashok Tanwar of the Dalit community has been removed and handed over the reins in Haryana to Kumari Selja, a senior leader of the Dalit community, so that the Dalit community is not disturbed
 yahi formula congress vidhayak dal kii netaa kiran choudhary ko hataane main bhi apanaaya gaya or unki jagah purv mukhyamantri bhupendra singh hooda ko banaaya
 Kiran Chaudhary comes from the Jat community, she is considered a good hold of the Congress high command
 hooda kheme ke vidhayak kiran choudhary ko hataane kii muhim lambey samay se chalaae hue the
 In such a situation, seeing the political strength of the Jat community, the high command took over the post from Kiran Chaudhary and assigned it to Bhupendra Singh Hooda
 congress kiran ke hatane se jaaton main galat sandesh na dene kii koshish kii he
 Under this strategy, instead of Dalit, Jat has played instead of Dalit and Jat
 haryana main congress netaaon ke bich gutbaji kaa khamiyaja loksabhaa chunaavon main bhi party ke safaaye ke rup main dekhne ko mila he
 In such a situation, the Congress high command has tried to give a signal before the assembly elections, but there are many such Chhatrap who have a figure of thirty-six with Hooda
 ashok tanvar is badlaav se shaayad hi khush hon, pichley kaaphi samay se khulkar hooda se unki adaavat rahi he
 Ashok Tanwar has roamed every district in the last six years and raised an army of his supporters
 aise main tanvar gut ke log vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan hooda ko samarthan karen yah kahana mushkil he
 Randeep Singh Surjewala is a senior Congress leader and is considered close to Rahul

 Looking at the elections, he has increased his activities in Haryana

 Recently he decided to issue his own separate manifesto by holding a Dalit Chetna rally

 In Haryana, Captain Ajay Singh Yadav is counted in the Ashok Tanwar and Kiran Chaudhary camps
 congress main hue badlaav ke baad ajay yadav ke kadam par logon kii najar he
 The possibility of opposing former Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda will not be ruled out
 kuldeep bishnoi or bhupendra singh hooda ke bich rishte jagajaahir hai
 Kuldeep is a non-jat leader of the Congress
 vah hooda kaa netritv sweekaar karenge yah kahana mushkil he
 During the Lok Sabha elections, Kuldeep Bishnoi had clearly stated that he would not work under Hooda's leadership
 yahi vajah rahi ki march main vah hooda ke netritv vaali bas main bhi savaar nahin hue the
 Last night, a suspicious bag was found at Indira Gandhi International Airport in Delhi, suspected to be an RDX
 vahiin airport main suraksha badha di gai he
 Defense agencies have started investigating the bags

 Contradictions of opposing parties are coming to the fore amid efforts to form an opposition grand alliance to give a strong challenge to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the NDA in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections

 a laborer of Jodhpur city of Rajasthan has proved that you do not have to be rich to do charity
 iske liye to bas dil bada hona chahie
 Shakur Mohammad, 62, is a daily wage laborer
 unhone saal 1984 main 4,000 rupee main chah plot kharide the jinamein se teen plot unhone ek aspataal, madrasa va masjid banavaane ke liye daan kar diya he
 The current price of these three is more than one crore rupees
 unhone anya plot diagnosis lab ke liye daan kiya he
 Each plot donated is 150 square yards and currently each is worth not less than Rs 25 lakh
 shakur ne baaki bache do plot apni do betiyon ko de die hai
 Shakur donated a piece of land to build a small hospital in his mother's name about two years ago
 jodhpur ke purv mahayor rameshwar dadhich ne vahaan 40 lakh rupee kii laagat se ek praathmik swasthya centre banwaaya
 Now more than 50 patients come to the health center for treatment every day
 shakur ne bataaya, 'main aspataal ke liye jameen daan karne ke baad bahut santusht va khush hua
 He said, 'I have since started this work of donating land
 main anpadh hum, lekin chahta hum ki mere samudaay ke bachche padhein or isliye jameen kaa ek anya hissaa daan kiya, jo maine madrasa shuru karne ke liye lee thi
 There is work going on there now

 He said, 'I have no appetite for the things of the world

 '- inputaniansh While growing up in India, i did not know a single woman who had been sexually abused
 isliye nahin ki yah koi adarsh duniya thi, balki isliye kyonki is bare main kabhi baat nahin kii jaati thi
 All the young women i know, all of them were victims of sexual harassment or worse
 lekin sunne ko yah miltaa—aisa karne vaale ajanabi log the or yah utpeeda kshanik tha
 Hearing this, it was harassment, never attacked
 sunne ko yah miltaa, yah durlabh tha, sirf ek ne kiya tha
 Then why bother to oppose it
 jab main 20 saal kii ho gai, tab bhi auraton main in masalon par baatcheet bahut kam hi hoti thi kyonki insaaf kii unki avadharana utani hi simit thi
 There was no expectation that anyone should listen or interfere with the police or family members
 duniya ke baaki hisson main auraton ke liye jo yatnaa thi, bharat main vah rosemara kii jindagi kaa hissaa thi
 The woman would suffer harassment and life would go on as before
 yah kaha ja saktaa he ki kai anya chizon ke saath-saath 20 ke aasapaas kii ham auraten insaaf kaa sahi matlab bhi nahin samajhati thim
 In this context, at least our experience used to say this
 insaaf nahin tha
 Was not consistent and was not at all
 chunki hamen yah ehsaas hi nahin tha ki insaaf nahin he, isliye ninsaphi ke badale ham uski pahchaan bhi nahin kar paae
 Silence is harmful, but a culture of silence makes crime autocratic
 chuppi vah jameen taiyaar karti he, jahaan vahi aparaadh baar-baar, lagaataar doharaaya jaataa rahata he
 Later awareness came, with delayed pains and tensions, but until this awareness was there, at least for a reporter and writer like me, this fight was not a fight for justice for people like us, but rather for them
 There was a fight for justice for women, whose condition is much worse
 aisi auraten is kadar haashie par padi hui hai ki unhen sirf apni deh ke kaaran hi nahin, balki behad maamuli nijee faislon ke kaaran bhi dhokhaa khaanaa padaa
 i think it is a little easier to demand justice for someone else than you
 yadi madhyavarg ke sandarbh main insaaf kii baat karen to pichley saal is desh kii shahari mahilaon ko apni ek aawaaj mili he
 The inspiration to raise this voice came from the incident of gang rape and torture of a 23-year-old girl in a moving bus in Delhi last year
 us ladki kii jindagi ne middle class ko jhakazorkar rakh diya
 As i read her story about how she was a young, educated, ambitious and out-of-the-way person and i thought about myself
 sambhaavnaaon se bhari us ladki kaa jivan chin liya gaya kyonki use kamjor mana gaya, kyonki hamalavar yah acchhee tarah jaanate the ki ve uske saath kuch bhi kar sakate hai, bina kisi sajaa ke dar ke
 The arrest of the victim's assailants, imprisonment and the death sentence awarded to four of the six (one was a minor at the time, while the other allegedly committed suicide in jail) has brought some relief
 pehali baar aisa laga he ki ek mahila kii aawaaj suni gai he, jisane hinsa kii karrwai kaa itani shiddat or takat ke saath lagaataar virodh kiya
 The importance of this cannot be underestimated that our voice was finally heard
 aawaaj uth rahi he
 The sound is the loudest, the loudest and the surprise is happening on such a large scale
 soshal media is maamle main sabase zyada mukhar he
 Although Twitter's immediate response has both advantages and disadvantages, it has become a courtroom instead of free confessions from Azad and Bellaus virtual confessions
 is manch kaa istemaal auraten apane upar hamalaa karne vaale kii aalochana karne ke liye kar rahi hai
 Many attackers have also been punished under the law
 ek ghatana yah dikhaati he ki ham kis tarah kii hyper connected duniya main rah rahe hai
 Two men on a motorcycle, accompanied by a young Mumbai-based woman, disguised herself while she was riding in an auto
 usne turant apane upar hamalaa karne vaale in logon kaa photo twit kar diya
 This photo, which went online in September, immediately started spreading quickly on the Internet
 phir ise ek sthaneey akhbaar main prakashit kiya gaya or un mardon ko pakadakar poochtacha ke liye thane bhi laayaa gaya
 a similar incident happened to me about a decade ago, but i did not react or perhaps i was not so intelligent then
 main ek autoricshaw main peeche kii seat par akeli baithi thi
 Then the driver turned back and threatened me
 usne meraa rasta roak liya or mujhe baahar nikalne nahin de rahaa tha
 i pleaded for help, but the passers by on that busy road in central Delhi ignored me
 jaise aaj mere paas phone he, tab madad ke liye phone bhi nahin tha
 Who used to have a cellphone at that time? i dared to protect myself from a strong-mannered middle-aged man
 jab vah paas aayaa to driver satark ho gaya
 The driver began to apologize when he saw the auto inside
 usne mujhase bhi maafee maangi or jaise hi main utari, vah auto lekar trephic main laapata ho gaya
 If i had access to technology at that time, the situation would probably have been different
 lekin driver kii pratikriya asaamaanya thi
 He knew that the one who saved me could harm him, even though he had no such notion about me
 duusari taraf hamalaavaron ke photo twit karne vaali mahila ne ek sabak sikhaaya he
 He has shown that a young and vulnerable woman was also strong
 shaayad use apane ko hamalaavaron se bachaane ke liye auto se baahar jane or takat kaa prayog karne kii jarurat nahin thi, jaisaa ki shaayad koi mard karata
 Even she did not react
 lekin usne aise karaara jawaab diya he ki ve hamlawar ab dobaaraa kabhi aisa karne se pehle sau dfa sochenge
 i am not saying that social media has become the answer to sexual harassment and violence
 sach to yah he ki bharatiyon kaa ek chota tabaka hi twitor or fasebuk kaa istemaal karata he
 But for women who, despite their education, outreach and relatively comfortable facilities, feel that they are not even able to get justice if they are sexually harassed or sexually assaulted, social media becomes a surprisingly valuable and credible place for them
 has gone
 aisa nahin he ki sirf bharat kii mahilaayein hi is makasad ke liye twitor kaa istemaal karti hai
 But even today, sexual harassment is a terrible problem in the lower classes in India
 dilli gang rape ke baad hue virodh pradarshnon se maahaul main kaaphi badlaav aayaa he, lekin baavjood iske aaj bhi mahilaayein madad ke liye police ke paas nahin janaa chaahatin
 It is still bizarre and questionable that the new anti-rape law introduced earlier this year puts all the responsibility of proving crime on the shoulders of the victim, even though it is already strong
 jaisaa ki ham sab jaanate hai, november main tahalaka kii ek patrkaar ne sansthaapak tarun tejpal par yon hamale kaa aarope lagaaya
 The allegation was made by sending an e-mail to the managing editor of the magazine
 jab yah mail li hua to pehali baar twitor par dikhaa
 Not on any mainstream news channel
 tathy to yah he ki agar mail twitor par nahin pahunchaa hota to yah maamla kabhi aage nahin bad paata
 The attack drew attention to the problem of sexual harassment of women at the workplace
 isse pataa chalaa ki tahalaka jaisi company bhi yon utpeeda adhinium, 2013 kii sharton ko lagu karne main vifal rahi, jo khud haashiye par pade logon kii khatir ladgaye ke liye jaani jaati he
 According to the guidelines of the Visakha case, a committee should be set up to hear complaints of sexual harassment at the workplace
 lekin desh bhar se hue twiton se pataa chalata he ki is tarah kii cameti ek durlabhtam cheez he or adhikansh offis main is tarah kii koi cameti nahin he
 The truth is that many women did not know what rights they had for complaining about such harassment within the office
 isi tarah teevr or prakhar pratikriya ne us kukhyat 'jasusi vivaad’ ko bhi surkhiyon main banaae rakhaa
 When a website broke the news that the intelligence officer of Gujarat was keeping a watch on a young woman on the instructions of a high-level politician who is believed to be the Chief Minister of the state, Narendra Modi, the word Saheb became trend
 li hui baatcheet main raajnneetijna ke liye is shabd kaa istemaal hua he
 When the young woman's father claimed that he had requested the Chief Minister's Office to supervise, it triggered a response that had never been part of public interaction before it — stalking was also one of the violence against women And form
 lekin isse yah bhi pataa chalata he ki kis tarah se pitrusattatmak bhartiya samskruti main pita, bhai or pati ko yah lagata he ki unhen apane parivaar kii vayask mahila kii jindagi ko puri tarah badal dene vaale maamalon main bhi faisle lene kii puri aazaadee he
 Even if it is a gross violation of his human rights and freedom
 bahut badi sankhya main madhyavarg kii mahilaon ne pehle ke mukaable apane jivan main bade parivartan kii baat sweekaar kii he
 But the figures do not reveal this truth
 sachaai to yah he ki dilli gang rape ke baad sabakaa dhyaan is ore aakarshith hone ke baavjood rajdhani main pichley saal ke mukaable is saal balaatkaar ke maamalon kii sankhya doguni se zyada rahi he
 Even in a city like Mumbai, such news is making headlines, where at times i felt safe enough to go to a dance bar full of gangsters for research in connection with writing a book
 is saal agast main shahar ke sabase vyast or sampann ilaakon main se ek maani jane vaali jagah par 22 saal kii ek photo jarnlist ke saath gang rape hua
 Out of 3 crore cases awaiting justice in the courts of India, 90,000 cases are of rape
 har jagah mahilaon ke khilaaf hinsa ke badhate maamalon par activiston kaa maananaa he ki balaatkaar ke maamle darasal utani teji ke saath nahin bade hai, balki unhen darj karaane kii sankhya badi he
 This new desire to raise its voice also shows that the media has also increased its persistence in taking up the action of violence against women
 online samvaad se prerit hokar bahut-si mahilaon ne print media main khoji report, sampadakeey likhe hai
 Writing on women's issues has now become a reporting beat that was once neglected
 insaaf kaa vichaar thodaa lacheela he
 The woman wants fair and immediate justice
 soshal media is insaaf kaa ek jariya he, jiske bare main zyaadaatar mahilaayein anbhigya hai
 Therefore the possibilities become a bit limited
 lekin isamen koi andeh nahin he ki twitor reporting ke ek saadhan ke rup main safal rahaa he
 The section of the population that is most active on Twitter has the benefit of such reporting
 vah uttejit hota he or isse logon main gussa badhata he
 Can Twitter really change how people in India talk and think about women's rights? No, the number of people using it is very less
 lekin yah itnaa jarur kar saktaa he ki ise istemaal karne vaale logon kii saadhan sampannataa or pahunch ko dekhte hue kisi bhi mudde par media or logon kaa dhyaan banaae rakhe
 Be sharp and be consistent
 unke liye jo us daur ko dekh chuke hai, jab ek aurat ke liye insaaf kaa koi dastur nahin tha, sirf vichaar bhar tha, yah vastav main ek acchhee shuruyaat ho sakati he

 unhone congress ke purv adhyaksh seetaram kesari ko dalit bataa diya
 In fact, while addressing the rally in Mahasamund in Chhattisgarh, the PM said that Dalit Sitaram Kesari was not allowed to complete his term of the post of Congress President, he was removed from the way for the coronation of Sonia Gandhi
 unhone kaha ki ek parivaar kii chaar pidiyon ne desh par shashan kiya or satta main hone kaa phayda uthaaya, lekin desh ko unke shashan se phayda nahin hua

 At the same time, lake development fees will have to be paid in non-municipal areas, but there it will be Rs 20 per square meter
 tippaniyan The Commissioner of Brihat Bengaluru Mahanagar Municipality, Manjunath Prasad, told that only Bangalore city has 170 lakes, which costs Rs 100 crore every year on maintenance
 shahar kii aabaadi tezi se bad rahi he or buniyadi adhosanrachana kii kami kii vajah se pradooshan kaa str bhi in jhiilon main kaaphi badha he
 In such a situation, proper maintenance of these lakes is not being done
 nateeja yah he ki kabhi belandur lake main pradooshan kii vajah se aag lagati he to kabhi yamalur lake main jaharila jhaag itnaa banataa he ki sadakon par barf jaisi parat jam jaati he
 However, the encroachment on the land of lakes is also responsible for this

 The population of the city is increasing rapidly and pollution levels have also increased significantly in these lakes due to lack of basic infrastructure
 aise main in jhiilon kaa samuchit rakrakhaav nahin ho paa rahaa he
 The result is that sometimes there is a fire due to pollution in the Bellandur Lake, sometimes the poisonous foam is formed in the Yamalur Lake so that the ice-like layer of roads accumulates
 haalanki iske liye jhiilon kii jameen par atikaraman bhi jimmedaar he
