 China has said goodbye to the 'one child policy' that has been going on for 36 years and since Friday officially Chinese couple has been approved to have two children
 sarkaar kii is niti ke prabhavi hone ke baad ab chini danpati do bachche paidaa kar paaenge lekin isse adhik bachche paidaa karne par abhi bhi pratibandh he
 However, for the past several years, it was also relaxed with some conditions but due to the aging population of the country, it was decided to end the decades-old policy
 china main 1970 ke ant main desh kii aabaadi ek arab ke aankade ko paar kar gai thi or sarkaar isse desh kii arthvyavastha par padane vaale prabhaav ko lekar chintaa main pad gai thi, jiske baad china ke netaa deng jiyaoping ne 1979 main ek santan niti prastaavit kii, jise amal main laayaa gaya
 The Chinese government believes that a child policy has allowed the government to control the birth of 400 million children in the country, but this figure is controversial
 haalanki kai saamaajik kaaryakartaaon ne is niti kaa virodh karte hue ise prajnan or maanavadhikaron kaa hanan bataaya tha
 Sociologist Vipin Mehta says that there were many challenges before China, for example, the population of the country is getting older, the country is struggling with a shortage of young workers and even after looking at the young brigade in India, which is at the peak of development
 Worried
 in sab chunautiyon kii gambhirtha ko dekhte hue ek santan niti ko nirast kar do bachche paidaa karne ko manjuuri di gai he
 It is estimated that by 2050, more than a quarter of China's population would have been over 65 years of age if this policy continued in the country
 china ke kuch chuninda virgon or un logon ko is niti ke daayre se baahar rakhaa gaya tha, jinaki pehali santan beti thi
 Chinese affairs journalist Omshiv said that one of the reasons for the repeal of a child policy is that there was anger among the people for the past few years
 kai sanghathan or maanavadhikaar kaaryakarta iskaa virodh karte hue kah rahe the ki koi desh kis prakaar yah nirdhaarit kar saktaa he ki uske naagarik kitni santan paidaa karen, yah to sidhe-sidhe maanavadhikaron kaa hanan he
 The number of elderly population in China is continuously increasing, compared to which the number of youth has decreased drastically

 Experts also believe that ending a child policy will not make much difference, as there are still a large number of Chinese couples who are not in favor of producing another child, as this would lead to reading up on children's upbringing
 Won't want to bear the expenses
 desh main das karod danpatiyon main se adhik sankhya un logon kii he, jinaki duusari santan ko janm dene main koi dilchaspee nahin he
 Professor Manik Kant of the Sociology Department of Deshbandhu College, Delhi, says that it was very important for China to take this step, as there are more number of tax paid pensioners than workers in the country
 china main bujurgon kii sankhya pichley saal 21 karod 20 lakh tak pahunch gai he
 The comments china ke rashtriya swasthya evam parivaar niyojan ayog (enechaspisi) ke pramukh lee bin ne safataur par kaha tha ki communist party of china (sipisi) kaa yah faisla desh kii bujurg ho rahi aabaadi se nipatane ke liye liya gaya he
 Whatever the reason, it is clear that China is facing a challenge from the young population of India and it has now agreed that to maintain the pace of the economy in the country, the ban on a child policy will have to be lifted
 haalanki, is maamle main bahut der ho chuki he, lekin jab jaago tabhi savera
 In China, the country's population crossed the one billion mark in the late 1970s and the government was worried about the impact it would have on the country's economy, after which Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping proposed a child policy in 1979
 Key, which was implemented
 china sarkaar kaa maananaa he ki ek santan niti se sarkaar desh main 40 karod bacchon ke janm ko niyantrit kar pai he lekin yah aankada vivaadaaspad he
 However, many social activists opposed the policy, calling it reproduction and human rights abuses
 samajashastri vipin mehta kehete hai ki china ke samaksh kai chunautiyaan thim, masalan desh kii aabaadi main bujurgon kii sankhya adhik ho rahi he, desh yuva kamgaaron kii kami se jujh rahaa he or vikaas ke shikhar par agrasar bharat main yuva brigade ko dekhte hue bhi china chintit he
 In view of the seriousness of all these challenges, a child policy has been approved to be repealed
 anumaan lagaaya gaya he ki yadi desh main yah niti jari rahati to 2050 tak china kii ek chauthai se adhik kii aabaadi kii umr 65 saal se adhik hoti
 a select few sections of China and those whose first child was a daughter were excluded from the purview of this policy
 chini maamalon ke patrkaar omshiv ne bataaya ki ek santan niti ko nirast karne kii ek vajah yah bhi he ki pichley kuch varshon se is niti ko lekar logon main rosh bana hua tha
 Many organizations and human rights activists were opposing this, saying that how a country can determine how many children its citizens can produce is a direct human rights violation
 china main bujurg aabaadi kii sankhya lagaataar bad rahi he, jiske mukaable yuvaaon kii sankhya main betahasha kami ai he
 Currently, more than 21 million people in China are over 60 years of age and this figure is set to increase in the near future
 desh main lagaataar bad rahi bujurgon kii dekhbhaal par vah adhik kharch kar rahaa he, jisase zyada vah vahan nahin kar saktaa he
 As the number of elders increases steadily, they will have to spend a lot on their pension
 jaankaar yah bhi maanate hai ki ek santan niti samaapt karne se zyada fark nahin padane vaala, kyonki abhi bhi aise chini danpatiyon kii sankhya bahut adhik he, jo duusari santan paidaa karne ke paksh main nahin hai, kyonki isse bacchon ke laalan-paalan par padhane vaala kharch vah vahan nahin karnaa chaahate
 More than 100 million couples in the country belong to people who are not interested in giving birth to other children
 dilli ke deshbandhu college ke samajashaastra vibhaag ke professor manik kaant kaa kahana he ki china ke liye yah kadam uthaanaa bahut jaruri thi, kyonki desh main kamgaaron kii tulana main kar chukaane vaale pensiondhari logon kii sankhya adhik he
 The number of elderly people in China has reached 21
2 million last year
 tippaniyan Li Bin, the head of China's National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC), clearly stated that this decision of the Communist Party of China (CPC) has been taken to deal with the aging population of the country
 kaaran chaahe jo bhi ho, saaf he ki china ko bharat kii yuva aabaadi se chunauti mil rahi he or vah ab yah maan chukaa he ki desh main arthvyavastha kii raftaar ko banaae rakhana he to ek santan niti par pratibandh ko hataanaa padegaa
 However, it is too late in this case, but only when awake dawn

 Gujarat CM Anandiben Patel has announced her resignation from her post
 anandiben ne fasebuk par ek post ke jariye kaha he ki wo mukhyamantri pad kii jimmedaari se hatana chaahati hai
 It is being said that Anandiben can be entrusted with the responsibility of governor of a state after 15 August
 sutron ke mutabik anandiben ke uttaradhikari ke taur par vijay rupani, purushottam rupala or nitin patel ke naamon kii charchaa ho rahi he
 In 2014, when Narendra Modi became the country's PM, Anandiben Patel was handed over the power of Gujarat
 lekin do saal bitate-bitate aisa aakhir kya hua ki gujarat kii pehali mahila hone kaa gaurav hasil karne valianandiben ko mukhyamantriki kursi chhodani padi
 Anandiben wrote in a Facebook post that she will turn 75 in November this year
 agle saal 2017 ke aakhir main gujarat main vidhansabha ke chunaav hone vaale hai
 Also, Vibrant Gujarat summit held every two years is also going to be held in January 2017
 isliye vah chaahati hai ki nae aane vaale mukhyamantri ko in sabaki taiyaari kaa puraa vakt mili
 Splitting up on Anandiben's curse, a cursory look at the events since 2014, one after another, happened in Gujarat, raising questions on Anandiben's leadership
 in ghatnaon se 1998 se soobe kii satta par kabiz bijepi kii kirakiri to hui hi, centre sarkaar ke mukhiya ke taur par piem modi ko bhi kaaphi fajihat jhelni padi
 Come, let's look at such incidents which led to a lot of disgrace of the party including Anandiben
 
 
 1
 patel-patidar movement took the power of Anandiben for a year, and in August 2015, there was a big movement in the state
 aarakshan kii maang ko lekarhardik patelki aguwai main shuru hue is andolan ne vishaal rup le liya
 Violence took place at all places in the state, causing widespread damage to government property
 is andolan se saaf ho gaya ki anandiben kii prashasan par pakad majboot nahin he
 It is believed that due to these movements, the party had to bear the brunt in the Bihar assembly elections
 2
 Allegations of corruption The opposition Congress in the state alleged that Anandiben committed corruption while Kirendra Modi was the CM, when she was the revenue minister in Modi's cabinet
 congress kaa aarope he ki gujarat sarkaar ne 2010 main modi ke mukhyamantri rahete anandiben kii beti anaar patel ke bijness partner ko oune-paune daam par jameen di thi
 It was alleged that the land worth Rs 125 crore near Gir Lion Sanctuary was sold for just Rs 1
5 crore
 sancturi ke paas kul 400 acre jameen main se 250 acre jameen ko 60 hajaar rupee prati acre ke rate par bechaa gaya, jabaki us samay jameen kaa sarkari rate 50 lakh rupee prati acre tha
 3
 bete-betiyon ne bhi dubaiabator siem modi ke kaarykaal se anandiben ke kaarykaal kii tulana karen, to is dauraan anandiben par bhai-bhatijawad ke bhi aarope lage
 It is alleged that Anandiben's daughter Anar Patel and son Shwetank interfere in the administration work
 aisi dharna bani ki anandiben kii santaanen sarkaar ke kaamkaaj main dakhal detii hai
 After making such allegations, PM Modi also warned Anandiben to improve his image

 In Panchayat elections, in the state of local bodies elections in December 2015, BJP suffered a huge loss and the Congress, which was losing support from the state, benefited
 nagar nigam chunaavon main haalanki bijepi kaa pradarshan acha rahaa or nagarpalika ke 56 siton main se 40 par party ko jeet hasil hui, lekin jila panchayat chunaav kii 31 siton main se congress ne apratyaashit 21 siton par kabja jamaaya, jabaki bijepi ko sirf 9 siton se santosh karnaa padaa
 The last time BJP won 30 of the 31 seats of Zilla Panchayat and the Congress was reduced to just 1
 bihar vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi ko mili shikast ke baad in chunaav ke nattejey party alaakaman ke liye behad dukhadaayi the
 5
 oona vivadgujrat samet bijepi shasit kai rajyon main gauraksha ke naam par atyaachaar kii ghatnaayen haal main saamne ain hai
 But the case of beating of Dalits in Una in the state took a lot of toll
 in ghatnaon se vipakshi congress ko bijepi par hamalaa karne kaa mauka to mila hi, dilli main sattarudh aam aadmi party ne bhi modi par nishaanaa saadhane kaa mauka haath se jane nahin diya
 All the Dalit organizations including former UP CM Mayawati also came out in protest against this incident
 upi main vidhansabha chunaav najadik hai, aise main party ko ashanka he ki aisi ghatnaon se dalit vot bank khisak saktaa he
 If this happens, the party may have to bear the brunt of it in the UP elections because the Dalit vote bank matters a lot in the state

 This is the case in Myanmar, where the administration deported a tourist from Spain for having a tattoo of Lord Buddha on his left leg
 buddha desh main aisa karnaa apmanjanak mana jaataa he
 The Spanish citizen was arrested at the famous tourist site Bagan City, which houses thousands of Buddhist temples, after Buddhist monks reported this to the administration
 uske baad yuvak or uske saathi ko thai shahar chiang may main nirvasit kar diya gaya
 The Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has explicitly warned on its website that it is not allowed in Myanmar to tattoo images of the Buddha on the body and to cover it on any open body, especially if it is on the feet

 It is known that on Monday, the US has again imposed economic sanctions on Iran, under which there is a provision for restrictive action on countries and companies buying and trading oil from Iran
 ye vahi pratibandh hai, jinhen purv america raashtrapati obama ne teen saal pehle hataa die the
 These restrictions were lifted by the Obama administration after Iran postponed its nuclear program

 The Supreme Court pronounced this decision on a petition filed by congress-ncp and Shiv Sena opposing BJP and Ajit Pawar's formation of government
 court ne 24 ghante ke andar bahumat sabit karne kaa aadesh sunaaya he
 Let us tell you that in the Maharashtra Assembly elections, BJP has got 105 seats, Shiv Sena 56, NCP 54 and Congress 44 seats
 bijepi or shivasena ne milakar bahumat kaa 145 kaa aankada paar kar liya tha
 But Shiv Sena kept demanding 50-50 formula according to which the model of running the government was two and a half years
 shivasena kaa kahana he ki bijepi ke saath samjhauta isi formule par hua tha lekin bijepi kaa daawa he ki aisa koi samjhauta nahin hua
 This led to differences so much that the two-year old friendship of the two parties was broken

 uttar korea kii taanaashaahee sarkaar aae din america ko parmaanu hamale kii dhamkee de rahi he
 President Trump has also increased the presence of the army here
 america nausena ne ilaake main apana yudhpot bheja he or dakshini korea ke alaava japan ke saath bhi kai yuddhayas kiye hai
 China scared of US missile defense? But China's biggest concern is the US missile defense system THAAD
 america ne pichley maheene hi dakshini korea ke purvi hisson main is system ko tainaat kiya he
 Washington says the move is aimed at tackling the threat of a missile attack from North Korea
 lekin china ise apni suraksha ke liye khatra maanata he
 In the opinion of Beijing, this deployment has strengthened the US military presence in the South China Sea
 china is sagar ke takreeban puure ilaake par daawa karata he
 But many countries in the area are against it

 dilli ke dipti siem manish sisodiya ne centre kii modi sarkaar kii aham yojanaon ke prachaar par sawaal uthaate hue jaankaree di he ki sarkaar bataaye ki prachaar ke liye koun si prakriya apanaai gai or bhugtan kaise hua
 Sisodia has raised questions on the central government's Digital India, Start-up India, Make in India and the Narendra Modi app
 sisodiya ne piem ke pradhan sachiv nripendra mishra ko chitthee likhakar poocha he ki 'bharat sarkaar in yojanaon ko jan-jan tak pahunchane ke liye soshal media tathaa twitor, fasebuk, google, utyub par vigyaapan karti he
 i want some information from you regarding the government's process of giving such advertisements
 'tippaniyan Sisodia has asked, 'was there any bidding process to advertise on social media? Which government department or private company paid for the advertisement? Who designed the Narendra Modi app? Who is the owner of Narendra Modi? How much did the Narendra Modi App cost? ' darasal dilli ke dipti siem manish sisodiya par mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ke july 2016 main hue kaarykram 'tok tu eke' main aniyamittaaon ke aarope hai jisamen sibiai unki bhoomika kii jaanch kar rahi he
 The allegation is that a private company was given an uncontested contract to promote the event
 ullekhneey he ki haal hi main dilli sarkaar ke sinchai evam baadh niyantran vibhaag kii audit report ai jiskaa audit khud dilli audit vibhaag ne kiya he
 The audit report has pointed fingers at the Delhi government itself

 Local stationery worth Rs 5 lakh was purchased, but was not found when the audit report asked for purchase papers

 The audit stated that there was a possibility of disturbances in paying the survey agency
 sisodiya ne poocha he ki 'soshal media par vigyaapan dene ke liye kya koi biding prakriya apanaai gai thi? vigyaapan ke bhugtan kis sarkari vibhaag yaa nijee company ne kiya? narendra modi app kisne banaaya he? narendra modi par malikana haq kiskaa he? narendra modi app ke vigyaapan par kitna kharch hua?' Indeed, Delhi Deputy CM Manish Sisodia has been accused of irregularities in Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's July 2016 program 'talk to AK' in which the CBI is investigating his role
 aarope yahi he ki is kaarykram ke prachaar ke liye ek nijee company ko bina tender theka diya gaya

 Jung itself is a problem, will Jung solve the problems? When there is talk of hate and war everywhere, then these lines written by Sahir Ludhianvi are very present
 aaj sahir kii jayanti he, or unhen isliye bhi yaad karnaa jaruri he ki vah muhabbat ke shaayar the
 There were poets of humanity
 unki shaayari ke paracham se hindi or urdu jagat to gulzaar hua hi filmi duniya bhi roshan hui
 However, Sahir did not accept it
 ek baar unhone likhaa tha-mana ki is zameen ko na gulzaar kar sakekuch kaar kam to kar gaye guzare jidhar se ham8 march, 1921 ko punjab ke ludhiana shahar main ek jameendaar parivaar main janmen sahir kii jindagi kaaphi sangharshon main beeti
 The real name of this magician of writing was Abdul Hai Fazl Muhammad
 unhone apni metric tak kii padhai ludhiana ke khalsa skool se puri kii
 He then moved to Lahore, where he completed his further studies from a government college
 jindagi ke utaar chadhaav or pyaar bhare lamhon ko apni shaayari or gaanon main utaarne vaale sahir shuruyaat main college ke kaaryakramon main apni gazalen or najmen padhakar sunaaya karte the, jisase unhen kaaphi shoharat mili
 These nazams and ghazals were not the only part of love
 ek vidroh, kranti kii gunj bhi thi
 When the victim is oppressed, then it is destroyed, the blood is destroyed, then it will freeze, then it will be said that when the well-known Punjabi writer Amrita Pritam was studying in college, since then Sahir's ghazals and nazmas became admired and started loving them
 sahir se amrutha kii pehali mulaakaat saal 1944 main hui thi
 She was attending a mushaira and there she met Sahir
 lautate samay barsaat ho rahi thi, or us din kii romaaniat kaa asar amrutha par taumr bana rahaa
 But the matter did not go ahead
 kuch samay ke baad hi sahir college se nishkasit kar die gaye
 You did not find any charges for me now, you have a similar charge
 The reason for expulsion from the college is that Amrita Pritam's father had reservations about Sahir and Amrita's relationship because Sahir was Muslim and Amrita was a Sikh
 isaki ek vajah yah bhi thi ki un dinon sahir kii mali haalat bhi thik nahin thi
 Sahir was probably writing this in such times
 un kaa gam un kaa tasawwur un ke shikave ab kahaub to ye baaten bhi i dil ho gayi ai gaipar amrutha ne unka peechha na choda
 Amrita used to love innocent Pritam Sahir Ludhianvi
 unhone sahir se apane pyaar ke kisse kabhi chhipaae nahin
 She called her love for Sahir the Milky Way
 apni jeevani 'rasidi tikat' main amrutha ek daur kaa zikr karte hue bataati hai ki kis tarah sahir lahore main unke ghar aayaa karte the or lagaataar cigarette piya karte the
 There are many wafa-shirs, even if there is a laugh, then talk about the same infidel today, Amrita was addicted to Sahir
 par sahir bhi isse achoote nahin the
 Whatever Sahir may say, this love was not one sided
 pichley saal 'sahitya ajtak' ke kaarykram main sahir ludhiaanvi or amrutha preetam ke isi pyaar par aadhaarit shekhar suman or dipti naval dwaara khelaa gaya naatak 'ek mulaakaat' kaaphi saraahaa gaya tha
 It is said that Sahir was unacceptable to Amrita
 amrutha kaa prem sahir ke liye is kadar paravaan chadh chukaa tha ki unke jane ke baad vah sahir ke pie hue cigarette kii baton ko jamaa karti thim or unhen ek ke baad ek apane hothon se lagaakar sahir ko mahasoos kiya karti thim
 This was the habit that made Amrita add cigarette addiction
 amrutha preetam hi sahir ke cigarette nahin sambhalati thi balki sahir bhi unki chaay kii pyaali sambhaal kar rakhte the
 If we bring a new God of every kind of religion, then we also talk about which God, i joined the writing after being expelled from college in 1943
 isi daur main unhone apana pehla urdu prakaashan 'talkhiyaan' likhi
 After nearly two years of relentless efforts, their hard work paid off and 'talkhiyan' was published
 'talkhiyaan' kaa nayaa sanskaran haal hi main phir se prakashit hua he
 Sahir joined the Progressive Reuters Association and brought out several popular Urdu magazines such as Adabe Latif, Shahkar, and Savera, but seeing his revolutionary views in Savera, the Pakistan government issued a warrant of arrest against him
 lahore se ve dilli chale aae or kuch samay yahaan gujaarne ke baad saal 1950 main sahir mumbai aa gaye
 The Afsana, which does not have to be done, is not possible to give it a beautiful twist
 Good Sahir wrote his first song 'badal Hai Zindagi' in the movie 'azadi ki rahi par' released in 1950 but the film was not successful
 saal 1951 main esady burman kii dhun par unhone film ‘noujvaan’ ke liye 'thandi hawaaen laharaa ke aaye, tumko yahaan rut he javaan kaise bulaaen' likhaa, or phir to geetkaar ke rup main chaa gaye
 Sahir wrote several superhit songs under Khayyam's music direction
 kehete hai saal 1958 main film ‘phir subah hogi’ ke liye abhinayta rajkpur yah chaahate the ki unke pasandida sangeetkaar shankar jaykishan sangeet den, lekin sahir ne khayyam ke liye hi dabaav banaaya or jab khayyam ne 'wo subah kabhi to aayegi' jaise geeton kii dhun banaai to yah sabit ho gaya ki sahir sahi the
 Sahir got a different height from the lyrics written for Gurudutt's 'pyaasa'
 kehete hai mumbai ke minerva tokies main jab yah film dikhaai ja rahi thi, tab jaise hi 'jinhen naaj he hind par wo kahaan hai' geet baja to sabhi darshak apni seat se uthakar khadey ho gaye or gane kii samaapti tak tali bajaate rahe

 He said that Naushad can be a great musician, but he makes any tune weigh itself
 atah geetkaar ko sangeetkaar se adhik paarishramik milanaa chahie, chaahe vah ek rupaya hi adhik kyon na ho

 unhone kaha ki rahul gandhi ke majahab or jati ko lekar congress bhramit he
 Attempts to make Rahul Gandhi's image Hindu are being contested
 vahiin, kendriya mantri ravishankar prasad ne kaha ki rahul gandhi siyaasi phaayde ke liye hindu hone ke dikhaave main badlaav karte rahete hai
 Let me tell you that on Saturday in Udaipur, Rahul also attacked Modi, saying that PMM speaks of Hinduism, but does not know about Hindutva
 saath hi rahul gandhi ne twit kar modi ko jod-tod kaa master bataaya
 On this comment of Rahul, Sushma Swaraj further said that Congress felt that it would not be only by saying Hindu, then there was an attempt to make a faithful Hindu
 isse bhi kaam nahin chalaa to naanaa kii jati brahman bataai jane lagi
 According to Sushma, Rahul Gandhi said that PM does not know what it means to be a Hindu
 unhone aisa isliye kaha kyonki ve or congress unke dharm or jati ko lekar bhramit hai
 For a long time, the party has been projecting him as a secular leader, but as soon as the elections came, he realized that Hindus are the majority, so he created this image
 videsh mantri ne kaha ki bayaan saamne aae he ki ve janeudhari brahman hai
 But i did not know that the knowledge of Janaudhari Brahmin increased so much that we now have to understand what it means to be a Hindu
 bhagwaan na karen ki vah din kabhi aae ki rahul gandhi se hamen hindu hone kaa matlab jaananaa pade
 Congress is in a dilemma about what to do
 dharm kaa parivartan to ho saktaa he, lekin jati parivartan nahin ho saktaa
 Not contesting elections, but will be active in politics
 The foreign minister answered the question of not contesting elections, that my health is fine, but the doctor has asked to avoid dust
 isliye main loksabhaa chunaav nahin lard rahi
 Although she said that i am not contesting elections, but i am not giving up politics
 ravishankar prasad bole-siyaasi lihaaj se hindu hai rahulavahin, bijepi ke varisht netaa or kendriya kanoon mantri ravishankar prasad ne kaha ki rahul gandhi kii samasya ye he ki ve bhram main hai
 Instead of being committed, they keep changing the appearance of being Hindu for their political gains
 ve siyaasi lihaaj se hindu hai
 Their Hindu faith varies with political advantages

 But due to which this dispute was being told, now the matter of elder son Tejapratap Yadav has been accepted to some extent
 tejpratap ke kareebi rajendra paswan ko party kaa general secetrari bana diya gaya he
 Earlier, it was being told that Tej Pratap wanted to make Rajendra Paswan the state president, on which the controversy started
 tejpratap ne kii lalu se baatis bich tejpratap ne kaha ki maine is bare main apane papa ko bataaya, to unhone kaha ki jo tumhaari baat he wo bhi ek tarah se sahi he
 Whatever party these people are doing, we will see them
 duusari taraf rabari devi ne bhi kaha he ki party or parivaar main sabakuch thik he, koi bhi vivaad nahin he
 (photo- Tej Pratap with Rajendra Paswan) What was Tej Pratap's statement? Actually, all is not well between the two brothers
 is baat kaa pataa shanivaar subah hi lag gaya tha, jab tej pratap yadav ne ek twit kiya tha
 In this, he described himself as Krishna and Tejaswi as Arjuna
 is twit main tej pratap ne kaha, 'meraa sochna he ki main arjuna ko hastinapur kii gaddi par baithaaun or khud dwarka chalaa jaaun
 Now some of the crooks have trouble that i should not be called King Maker
 'twit ke baad viral hua tha videotwit ke baad tej pratap kaa ek video viral hua, jisamen wo is baat ko lekar naaraaz dikh rahe hai ki party main unki koi nahin sun rahaa he
 In this viral video, Tej Pratap Yadav is talking about RJD leader Rajendra Paswan, who comes from Dalit society
 wo rajendra ram ko party main sammanjanak pad dene kii baat kar rahe hai
 They are also complaining that this demand is being ignored by the party

 Tej Pratap is complaining in this video that if he calls any leader, no one gives a response
 tej pratap video main party ke andar anushaasanheenata kii bhi baat kehete hai
 Tejashwi said - Seeing that my guidance case grows, Tejashwi Yadav also broke his silence and said that he has no quarrel with his brother
 unhone kaha ki wo mere bade bhai hai or maardarshak hai
 Tejashwi, former Deputy Chief Minister of Bihar, said that any grievances of Tej Pratap will be resolved through dialogue at the appropriate forum
 haalanki tejasvi ne is baat se inkaar kiya he ki tej pratap kii baton ko party main nazarandaaj kiya jaataa he
 This was the root of the dispute! According to the sources, Tej Pratap and Tejashwi Yadav were cold about the next RJD state president

 padmapuranamen bhagwaan shrikrishna dharmraj yudhisthir se kehete hai-is din tulsi kii manjari, dhoop-deep aadi se bhagwaan damodar kaa pujan karnaa chahie
 Mokshadaikadashi is the destroyer of great patriots

 The month of December will be very auspicious for these zodiacs
 In the pre-month of December, a king named Vaikhanas fasted this Ekadashi for the purpose of salvation of his ancestors when told by mountain sage

 The person who observes this Kalyanamayimoxada Ekadashi fast, all his sins are destroyed

 Upendra Kushwaha, who broke away from the bjp-led NDA, has become part of the Congress-led grand alliance
 is tarah ek taraf mahagathmban to duusari taraf endie kaa kunba he, jinke bich 2019 kii siyaasi jang kii bisaat bichaai ja rahi
 In such a situation, the two coalitions are not less than each other in terms of caste and political equation

 After Kushwaha's entry, the formula for the seat between the grand alliance in the state has been decided
 mana ja rahaa he ki bihar kii 40 loksabhaa siton main se congress ko 8-12 siten, argedy ko 18-20 siten, araspi ko 4-5 siten, HAM ko 1-2 siten or CPM-CPI ko ek seat mil sakati he
 Apart from this Sharad Yadav's LJD can get 1-2 seats
 endie main seat sheringwahin, bijepi ke netritv vaale endie se kushvaha ke alag hone ke baad ab algepi ke sur badale hue najar aa rahe the
 After three days of brainstorming, Paswan met Union Minister Arun Jaitley on Friday
 iske baad unke tevar naram hue hai
 In Bihar's total 40 Lok Sabha seats, a formula for seat sharing has been formed between the three parties of NDA
 haalanki is par antim faisla hona baaki he
 Under this, Ram Vilas Paswan's party LJP can get 17 BJP, 17 JDU and remaining 6 seats
 jabaki 2014 ke chunaav main algepi kul saat siton par chunaav ladi thi or chah par use jeet mili thi

 In fact, Kushwaha is bound to increase his political power after becoming a part of the grand alliance

 The number of voters of Kushwaha Samaj in 63 assembly seats of Bihar is more than 30 thousand
 jabaki kurmi samaaj kii aabaadi 3 fisadi he
 Chief Minister Nitish comes from this society
 is tarah se kushvaha samaaj kii aabaadi nitish ke kurmi vot bank se doguna he
 The big votebacks of Kurmi and Kushwaha society have been associated with Nitish Kumar for a long time, but Upendra Kushwaha has accused Nitish Kumar of breaking and weakening his party

 Addressing the concluding session of the two-day session of the Indian Youth Congress, the Prime Minister said that the decision taken by the government in relation to foreign direct investment in the retail sector was not done in any hurry but with much deliberation
 hamaara pakkaa vishwaas he ki yah faisla hamaare desh ke hit main he
 He said that we believe that FDI in retail will bring modern technology to India, reduce the wastage of agricultural products and our farmer brothers will get better prices for their crops
 pradhanmantri ne kaha ki thok or khudara daamon main abhi jo bada antar rahata he vah kam hoga or aam aadmi ko saste daamon par rosemara ke istemaal kii chijen mil sakengi
 As far as small retail traders are concerned, the experience of many other countries has been that both small and big retailers can simultaneously operate in a big country like ours
 unhone kaha ki iske alaava hamane apane faisle main kuch sharten bhi rakhi hai taaki khudara kshetra main epadiai aane se chote udyogon ko badhaava mili
 Most importantly, we are not forcing anyone for FDI in retail
 singh ne kaha, ‘jin rajya sarkaron ko aisa karne main phayda najar nahin aata unke paas apane rajya main khudara vyapaar main epadiai rokane ke upaay hai
 We believe that FDI in retail will create new opportunities for employment in sectors like food processing, transportation and storage
 ’ pradhanmantri ne kaha, ‘main aap sabase apil karuunga ki aap is vishay par janata ko sahi jaankaree den
 ' grahamantri amit shah ne loksabhaa main aaj jammu kashmir aarakshan sanshodhan vidheyak 2019 pesh kiya or rajya main raashtrapati shashan 6 maheene ke liye badhaane kaa prastaav diya
 While presenting the motion in Lok Sabha, Amit Shah said that elections are possible in the state by the end of this year
 grih mantri ne kaha ki ramajaan kaa pavitra maheenaa tha, ab amarnath yatra honi he, is vajah se chunaav karaane is dauraan mumkin nahin tha
 It was decided to hold elections later this year
 amit shah ne international border par rahane vaale logon ko bhi aarakshan dene kaa prastaav loksabhaa main rakhaa
 He said that this bill is not for making anyone happy, but for those living near the international border
 is maukey par unhone kaha he ki kashmir main unki sarkaar main pichley ek saal main jiro tolarence kii niti apanaai gai he
 He said that if there was an election in the state, there was a lot of violence
 lekin is barpanchayat chunaav menkisi kaa khun nahibaha he
 Incidents of terrorism have also come down
 grahamantri ne kaha ki suraksha kaarnon se abhi rajya main chunaav nahin karaae ja sakate hai
 But it is expected that the commission will conduct elections there in the next 6 months
 shah ne kaha ki vah sadan main record par tatkaaleen grahamantri or raksha mantri ko dhanyavad dena chahta hum
 He said that the time limit set by Rajnath Singh to build 15,000 bunkers will be adhered to without losing time
 4400 bunker taiyaar kar die gaye hai
 He said Jammu and Ladakh have been ignored in the state
 grih mantri ne kaha ki sarkari ore se jari fund ko labhaarthiyon tak pahunchane kaam sarkaar sunishchit karegi
 Along with this, he said that there is an attempt to root out terrorism from Jammu and Kashmir
 iske saath hi amit shah ne jammu-kashmir aarakshan sanshodhan bill ko pesh kiya he
 The Congress has supported it, but has opposed the proposal to extend the term of President's rule by 6 months
 congress kii ore se manish tiwari ne kaha he ki jab desh kaa bantawara hua to do mulk nikle ek islamic pakistan or to doosraa dharmanirpeksh bharat
 But the Muslims of Jammu and Kashmir decided to go to secular thinking of India
 lekin aaj jo paristhitiyaan or jisaki vajah se raashtrapati shashan badhaane kaa faisla liya gaya he
 But in 1990 when VP Singh had a government which was supported by BJP and Left parties

 ' dilli se sate noida ke sector 47 main safed sangemarmar se bani ek aaleeshaan kothi main jab anti karpshan beuro kii team ne chapa maaraa to us kothi ke andar kaa najaara dekhakar sab hairaan rah gaye
 The kothi, designed in a fine manner, was also neatly decorated in gardens
 kothi dekhakar kisi raja maharaja ke mahal kaa abhas ho rahaa tha
 This kothi is that of retired DSP Harshvardhan Bhadoria, who turned out to be the second Yadav Singh of Noida in terms of property
 red main khulaasa hua ki sangemarmar kii is aaleeshaan kothi ke alaava rasukhdaar ritred dspi bhadauria aisi kai kothiyaan hai
 The black letter of retired DSP is slowly coming out
 harsh vardhan bhadauria kaa naam noida or greater noida main behad charchit he
 As soon as the Yogi government arrived, Bhadoria filed a voluntary retirement application and soon Bhadoria got the VRS
 sawaal ye uthaa ki ritairement se mahaj 4 maah pehle bhadauria ne ritairement kyun liya
 So the answer is that as soon as Yogi came to the government, there was a fear of his black money being exposed
 noida praadhikaran main tainaat rahe or hameshaa vivaadon main rahane vaale ritred dspi harshavardhan bhadoria ke khilaaf anti karpshan beuro ne mukadmaa darj karaayaa he
 The Anti Corruption Bureau has filed this case in case of disproportionate assets
 sapa sarkaar ke behad kareebi rahe harshavardhan bhadauria khilaaf tainaati ke samay bhi kaaphi shikaayatein aati thim
 But due to political influence, no hair of Bhadoria was able to be dared
 aay se adhik sampatti arjeet karne ke maamle main jab beuro ko shikaayat mili to jaanch shuru kii gai
 The investigation revealed shocking that Bhadoria has acquired 1178 percent more assets than his income
 anti karpshan ne lagbhag 2 saal tak bhadauria kii sampattiyon kii jaanch kii or uske baad noida ke sector 49 thane main mukadmaa darj karavaaya
 According to the Anti Corruption Bureau, when the income earned through Harshvardhan Bhadoria was examined from 2003 to 2017, it was found that Bhadauria earned around Rs 8 lakh from his salary, while he spent Rs 10 crore in the meantime
 jisase saaf najar aata he ki harshavardhan bhadauria ne apni aay se kareeb 1178% zyada sampatti arjeet kii he
 The Anti Corruption Bureau was not able to properly investigate the properties of millionaire retired DSP Harshvardhan Bhadoria
 lihaaja aage kii jaanch ke liye noida police se madad maangi gai he
 In 1981, Harshvardhan Bhadoria was admitted to the UP Police as a Sub Inspector
 bhadauria uttar pradesh ke itawa jile kaa rahane vaala he
 On the basis of his political influence, he had earned crores as a sub-inspector
 sutara bataate hai ki bhadauria kii lottery tab lagi, jab use sapa sarkaar ke dauraan noida othority main tainaati mili
 The situation had become such that a new post of DSP was also created for his continued deployment in the Authority
 noida othority main tainaati ke dauraan noida ke 47 main karodon kii keemat aaleeshaan ghar, sector 57 main apane bete ke naam se 2-2 skool bhadauria ne khadey kar die
 a school rule in Sector 75 of Noida was enacted by following the law
 bhadauria ke rajshahi rahan sahan kaa andaja isi baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki usne noida ke sector 47 main bane apane aaleeshaan ghar tak pahunchane ke liye ek nayaa rasta banavaa liya tha
 Which only he had the right to walk
 uske ghar tak pahunchane ke liye green belt par avaidh nirmaan karaayaa gaya he
 Way on the green belt near the house and built guardrooms and their operatives outside the house
 bhadauria ne apane ghar main aane vaale viviipi logon ke liye lon ek stylist phoos kii jhopadi bhi banavaai he
 Sources say that the property of Bhadoria is so much that the investigation of this case is not about the bus of Noida Police
 iske liye sibiai yaa inkam tex vibhaag ko aage aana hoga
 However, the investigation is still with the Noida police
 FIR darj hone ke baavjood bhadauria se ab tak koi poochtacha nahin kii gai he
 If sources are to be believed, this case of corruption will be bigger than the arrested engineer Yadav Singh of Noida

 Hem Mali told him the whole thing
 uski vyathaa sunakar rishi ne use yogini ekadshi kaa vrath karne ke liye kaha
 Hem Mali methodically observed Yogini Ekadashi

 He alleges that Dinakaran is being harassed for being a Dalit
 saansad piel puniya or radhakant nayak ne ab is maamle ko up raashtrapati or pradhanmantri ke saamne rakhane kaa elaan kiya he
 He has made up his mind to meet the Vice President and Prime Minister in this regard on Monday

 Dalit mps of Congress have also opposed impeachment against him

 nambinarayanan ko lagata he ki yah bharat ke antariksh kaarykram ko patari se utaarne kii america central intelligence agency (siie) kii ek chaal thi
 And the main objective of this agency was to prevent the obtaining of sophisticated cryogenic engine technology from Russia for energy efficient rockets

 According to Harvey, the reason for this fabricated espionage case was India's attempt to buy this technology, ignoring the opposition of America
 us samay america kaa virodh isro or is praudyogiki kii aapurti karne vaali roosi antariksh form glavakosmas par pratibandh lagane tak aa pahunchaa tha
 After Russia backed out, it took ISRO years to develop it in its own country

 Recently, when the important launch of ISRO was being telecast live across the country, Nambinarayanan was sitting on his TV in Thiruvananthapuram with his TV turned off
 ve bole, ''ham sabaki uplabdhi par mujhe garv he
 But the pain and shame that i have been facing for 18 years has put an end to me
 ”haalanki hycourt kaa aadesh ek raahat kii tarah aayaa he magar ve bahut utsahit nahin hai
 He says, "we worked hard for India's scientific progress, but our own security agencies followed us

 ek adhyayan main paaya gaya he ki yah thik nahin rahegaa kyonki ek hi vakt main do jagah talmail baitaane kii koshish thakaau sabit hogi
 a team of researchers led by Professor Timothy Golden of the Renaisselaire Polytechnic Institute in New York found that such an opportunity would prove counterproductive because those sitting at home would not be able to keep pace with family demands and office demands
 daily telegraph ke anusaar yah paaya gaya ki apane kaam or ghar kii bhoomika saath nibhaane vaale aakhirkaar donon jimmedaariyon ko nibhaane se un logon kii tulana main adhik tang aa jate hai jo ek hi jimmedaari kaa nirvahan karte hai
 For his studies, Professor Golden's team questioned 316 people sitting at home working for a leading computer company and their effect at the end of the day and came to the conclusion that the role of the house and for the office Working is very painful

 After the meeting with environmentalist Anupam Mishra in Delhi, he emphasized on the village, Gandhi and Ganga

 Respiratory emergency is once again being seen
 15 din pehle jab dilli main lagaataar smog ke kaaran dikkatein hui thim, to skool tak band kar die gaye the
 But due to the smog in Delhi, now embarrassment has to be raised
 bharat or srilanka ke bich chal rahe test match main ravivaar ko pradooshan ke kaaran srilankai khilaadiyon ne mask lagaakar match khelaa
 People who came to watch the match said that yesterday was a matter of shame
 smog ke karanham pareshaani to jhel hi rahe hai, ab videshon se aae mehmaanon ke saamne bhi sharmindagi jhelni pad rahi he
 Some children who came to watch the match said that we also do not play matches due to pollution
 saans lene main dikkat hoti he
 In such a situation, we can guess what will be going on the Sri Lankan players
 srilanka ke khilaadiyon ne naatak kiya!ek ore jahaan kai log pradooshan ko lekar apni chintaa jataa rahe the, vahiin duusari ore kuch log srilankai khilaadiyon dwaara khel ke dauraan mask pahanane ko naatak bataa rahe the
 He said that the Kilankai team wanted to stop the match somehow
 magar aisa ho nahin sakaa
 Virender Sehwag was also tight-lipped about playing with a mask on Sri Lankan players
 vahiin, dilli main rahane vaale logon kaa kahana tha ki hamen to ab is pradooshan kii aadat ho gai he, lekinsrilankamein vaataavaran kuch alag he
 They are not used to such poisonous air
 isiilie unhen dikkat ho rahi hogi
 The Akshardham temple is so much invisible that the Akshardham temple is not visible due to this
 visibility behad kam ho gai he
 Vehicles are visible only about 500 meters away
 magar 500 meter ke baad kuch bhi nahin dikhaai nahin de rahaa he, jisase ki haadason kaa bhi dar bad gaya he
 Recently, 15 days ago due to smog, vehicles were not visible and many accidents also happened
 kul milakar ab sarkaar ko koi naa koi rasta nikaalnaa hoga, jisase pradooshan ko roka ja sake

 apni daansheeltaa ke kaaran unhen 'prince' kii oopaadhi praapt thi
 He has been awarded the Nobel Prize
 devendranath tagore kaa janm 15 may 1817 main hua tha
 He was the father of Rabindranath Tagore
 bataa den, bengal main tagore parivaar kaa teen sau saal purana itihaas he
 This superior family of Calcutta played an important role in the Bengal Renaissance
 is parivaar ne aise mahatmaon ko janm diya jinhone saamaajik, dharmik or saahitiyik kshetra main mahatvapurn yogadan diya he
 His son Rabindranath Thakur was a world-renowned poet, litterateur, while his second son Satyendranath Thakur was the first person to appear for the Indian Public Service Examination

 They were biased to reform Hindu religion and not to destroy it
 ve samaaj sudhaar main 'dhire chalo' kii niti pasand karte the
 For this reason, he had differences with both Keshav Chandra Sen and the radical Brahmasamajis, who are radical social reformers

 Due to the high character and spiritual knowledge of Devendranath ji, all the countrymen had reverence for him and used to address him 'maharishi'
 
 
 
 When Lal Bahadur Shastri took dowry he was most interested in the spread of education after Khadi Kanteshnti Niketanadevendranath religion
 unhone bengal ke vividh bhaagon main shiksha sansthaaen kholane main madad kii
 He bought 20 bighas of land in the year 1863 and after experiencing deep spiritual peace there, named it 'shanti Niketan', where his self-proclaimed son Rabindranath Tagore later founded Vishwabharati
