 kangana ranot kii film 'tanu vaids manu riterns' superhit sabit hui he
 Kangana's role has been highly appreciated by Bollywood
 big bi jaise bade stars ne prashansa chiththiyaan likhte hai
 In the last few years, there has been a makeover of the image of an actress in Bollywood, so she is Kangana
 aaie jaanate hai kangana ke dil kii kuch khaas baaten, wo bollywood se apana rishta kaisaa maanati hai or apane rolls ko kitna chalanging samajhati hai
 1
 'tanu vaids manu riterns'main datto kaa role kaaphi chalanging tha
 Tanu was also seen by the audience earlier
 uski beficri or bindaas image se sab waakif the
 But Datto is a simple Haryanvi girl
 wo mechap tak nahin karti he
 He is a countryside according to the song Banno
 par mujhe tanu ke saath saath datto bhi utani hi pasand he
 2
 darshakon ne pehle rani (queen main) ke kirdaar ko kaaphi pasand kiya
 Then Datto is also very brother to all
 isse mujhe pataa chalaa ki log ro or natural kirdaar dekhnaa chaahate hai
 Something that he can see by connecting his personal life
 3
 Entering the cinema world from 'gangster' at the age of 18, then Award for 'fashion' in 2008, then Award for 'queen' in 2014, and now 'tanu Weds Manu Returns' to reach the 100 crore club The journey was not easy
 lekin kangana ko ab pikchar hit karaane ke liye kisi superhit ko-actor kii jarurat nahin he
 He does not have security from any male actor in the industry
 4
 Kangana admits that once upon a time there were very limited roles of girls in Bollywood
 lekin jamaana bhi badal rahaa he
 The girls are now engineers, doctors, journalists
 wo samaaj main baahar nikal rahi hai, matlab cinema main bhi nai kahaniyon ko jagah mil rahi he
 5
 kangana apni safalataa ke 3 mantra maanati hai, kisi role ko pakadaney ke liye uski fijical apiyarence dekhnaa, uski body language par kaam karnaa, or uski vartmaan sthiti ko samajhnaa
 Kangana admits that a role takes away a part of your life and then you don't get it back
 jais 'fishan' karne ke baad wo 'darty pikchar' nahin kar sakati thim
 6
 kangana khud ko madhubala kii bahut badi fain bataati hai
 If she had a chance, she would also share the screen with him in a film
 kangana ke anusaar madhubala behad khubasurat or maasoom thim
 7
 angreji seekhney ke saath-saathkangana apane accent par bhi kaam kar rahi hai
 Without hesitating and blushing she tells that she wants to communicate with a large audience
 pehle jab wo kahin videsh jaati thim, to kisi se thik se pani bhi nahin maang paati thim
 8
 jab kangana se poocha gaya ki agar unke jaisi hi unki koi beti ho to wo kya karengi, to is par kangana ne hansate hue jawaab diya ki wo sanyas le lengi
 9
 industry ke mail stars bhi unke saath kaam karne se pehle ab kai baar sochate hai
 Everyone is afraid that Kangana may not eat her role in the film
 kangana irfan khan ke saath ek film kii shooting kar rahi hai
 There Irfan told him that how would 2 swords be in a sheath? Kangana considered this a supplement for herself that Irfan considered her as his rival
 10
 Apart from films, Kangana also wants to learn farming by taking a course
 wo gaajar jaisi tamaam chijen ugaana chaahati hai

 anitha kii maane to kaaka or anitha pichley aath saalon se saath the
 Anita lived with them in her blessings
 lekin jab se rajesh khanna kii tabiyat zyada kharaab hui unhen ghar se bedakhal karne kii kavayad shuru kar di gai
 Due to this, Anita Advani has sent a notice to the Khanna family under section 19
 anitha kaa ye bhi daawa he ki wo rajesh khanna ko bachapan se jaanati thi or tab se unki dost he
 However, Kaka did not confess to the relationship with Anita
 saal 2011 main ek akhbaar ko die interbue main rajesh khanna ne kaha tha, 'main anitha ko saalon se jaanata hum lekin baat abhi tak pyaar tak nahin pahunchi
 In the '70s, this bungalow on Carter Road in Mumbai was bought by Rajesh Khanna with the earnings of' Elephant Mere Sathi '
 aaj bhi rajesh khanna ke phans ke liye ye bangala ek mandir he jise ek museum banane kii baat bhi chal rahi he lekin kahin ab ye ashiana kanoonee pechidiyon main naa fansaa rah jaae
 Rajesh Khanna's last wish was that after him his bungalow be converted into a blessing museum
 aashirwad ko rajesh khanna ne rajendra kumaar se kharida tha
 Rajesh Khanna had said in an interview, 'I want Rajesh Khanna museum to be a blessing
 meri betiyon ke paas makaan hai

 The last round of civic elections in Uttar Pradesh will be held on November 29
 1 disambar ko voton kii ginati bhi ho jaaegi
 BJP has played bets on 187 Muslim faces, most of whom are women, in these civic elections in UP
 chaunkane kii baat he ki sirf sabhasad ke chunaav ke liye hi nahin balki bijepi ne 19 nagar parishad adhyaksh padon ke liye bhi muslim chehre utaare hai, jinamein 15 mahilaayein hai
 It is the same BJP that did not field a single Muslim candidate in the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections earlier this year
 darasal, bijepi 2019 loksabhaa chunaav ko lekar siyaasi guna-bhaag abhi se hi lagane main juty he
 In the BJP camp, this exercise and discussion is more about which section of Muslims will vote for them in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 uttar pradesh main shiya samudaay ke vot kuch had tak bijepi ko milte rahe hai, lekin ab party apana dayera badhaane ke liye muslim mahila votaron ko bhi adhik se adhik saath jodne ke liye mashkkat kar rahi he
 During this civic election in UP, party leaders were seen campaigning in the streets along with BJP flag-posters in Muslim-dominated areas
 aise ilaakon main jahambijapike netaa bahut hi kam jaaya karte the
 Not only did the party's offices open there, but the Muslim faces of the BJP were also seen doing meetings with indignation
 muslim bahul ilaakon main upi ke iklaute muslim mantri mohsin raja ne khub sabhaayen kin
 People gathered to listen to BJP leaders from narrow streets to small towns
 ye alag baat he ki in sunne waalon main se kitne vot main tabdeel ho pate hai
 It will be clear in the results of the elections on 1 December
 lekin itnaa jarur he ki bijepi ne muslim bahul ilaakon main bhi apni maujuudagi jarur darj kara di he
 In the civic elections, in districts like Rampur, Amroha, Sitapur, Bareilly Lakhimpur, Moradabad, Saharanpur, where there are a large number of Muslims, the BJP fiercely fielded Muslim candidates
 muslim bahul jilon ke alaava BJP ne lakhanu main 4 or varanasi main bhi 3 musalamaanon ko tikat die hai
 In Lucknow, 2 of the 4 Muslim candidates of the party are women, while in Varanasi, 2 out of the 3 candidates, Muslim women are in the fray

 s Rathore says that there is a growing trend of Muslims towards BJP
 tripal talaak kaa mudda uthne ke baad muslim mahilaayein badi taadaad main aage ai hai
 In such a situation, our attempt is to connect them with the party because our slogan is sabka saath, sabka vikas
 ’fatehpur ke ward number 20, saiyad ward se sabhasad kaa chunaav lard rahi shabbiri begum kahati hai ki ve 10 saal se BJP se judi rahi hai or is baar party se tikat maanga to mil gaya
 Shabiri Begum says that she will win the election and show that she has the support of all Hindus and Muslims
 shabbiri begum ke ilaake ke matadaata bhi unke bare main kehete hai ki kai varsh se ve samaaj seva se judi rahi hai
 Farzana Begum is BJP candidate from ward number 26 of Hidayat Nagar in Lakhimpur Kheri
 farjaana kahati hai kitripal talakse chhutkaaraa piem narendra modi ne dilvaaya he, aise main muslim mahilaon kaa bada tabaka unke naam par vot karegaa
 The women of this area also appeared in the tune of Farzana
 muslim ilaakon main bijepi ke liye saghan prachaar karne vaale upi ke alpsankhyak maamalon ke mantri mohsin raja kehete hai ki is dfa musalamaanon kii najar bijepi kii taraf bhi ja rahi he kyonki bijepi ne har gali mohalle main apane jhande binar ke saath sanghathan khadaa kar diya he
 According to Mohsin Raza, this preparation is not just for 2019 but to take BJP to the hearts of Muslims
 nikaay chunaav ke do charan nikal chuke hai or aakhri charan kachunaav prachaarbhi khatm ho gaya he
 Now the last phase election is to be held on November 29
 bijepi ke 187 muslim ummidavaaron main se kitne jeet paaenge, ye to 1 disambar ko nateezon se saaf ho jayega
 But the manner in which the BJP has preferred women among the Muslim candidates for the civic elections, it is determined that by the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, it wants to see a vote bank for Muslims as well

 As the Lok Sabha Election draws closer, the rhetoric between the Shiv Sena and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has started intensifying
 kuch din pehle bhaajapa adhyakshmit shah (amit Shah) ne kaha tha ki samay rahete agar unke sahyogi unke saath gathbandhan nahin karte hai to vah unhen chunaav menhara bhi sakate hai
 It was only after Shah's statement that other parties were expecting a strong reaction from Uddhav Thackeray

 In Sutri village of Jashpur district of northern Chhattisgarh, some tribals burn torches, firecrackers and make noise by drums to save their fields and houses from the clutches of mad elephants
 par yah muqabla barabari kaa nahin he kyonki jeet aam taur par nashe main jhuumate haathiyon kii hi hoti he
 These tribals make liquor from Mahua, which is in abundance in this area
 har parivaar ko paanch litre sharaab banane kii ijaajat he
 Like making and drinking liquor from Mahua, elephants have also suffered the development of elephants
 har saal garmi aate hi mahua kii nashili gandh, jashpur ke jangalon ke aas-paas based gaanvon main jabardast tabaahi lekar aati he or uski maar jharkhand or orissa ko bhi jhelni padati he
 For the last few days, dozens of elephants have targeted the villages of Jashpur, they do not even care about the noise of torches, firecrackers and drums
 mast hathi mitti ke gharon ko todakar vahaan rakhi mahua kii sharaab pite hai or phir aage bad jate hai
 And the tribal people cry on their helplessness after seeing the devastation in front of their eyes
 chunki garmi ke maheene main jangal kaa pani suukh jaataa he or ped-paudhe bhi kam ho jate hai, isliye hathi pani or bhojan kii talash main insaani bastiyon kii taraf badaae lagate hai
 The liquor of Mahua placed there only leads to intoxication
 lekin sarkaar ko manushyon se zyada chintaa haathiyon kii he
 On April 9, elephants had crushed 5-year-old Annu Bai in Kunkri village and injured another girl
 pichley ek maah main jashpur main haathiyon ke 40 se zyada hamale ho chuke hai
 But nothing happened for the safety of the people
 On April 14, when a corpse of a pregnant elephant was found dead by a wire wound in Sagarpur village of Raigad district, 50-year-old farmer Narayan Biswas was sent to jail for killing him
 Given

 According to the forest officials of Chhattisgarh, wild animals have made a corridor from Jharkhand and Odisha to Chhattisgarh
 ek varisht van adhikari bataate hai ki pedo kii avaidh kataai or jharkhand tathaa orissa main khanan se sikudte jangalon ne haathiyon ko chhattisgarh kii taraf aane par majaboor kar diya he
 Chhattisgarh forest minister Vikram Usendi told the assembly that since 2010, 82 people have died due to elephant attacks
 ye hathi 1994 se uttari chhattisgarh main jashpur, raigarh, sarguja, korba or korea kii taraf aa rahe hai
 Some of them returned to Jharkhand and Odisha but more than 150 elephants have camped in the forests of Chhattisgarh
 mukhya vanyajeev sangrakshak ram prakaash kaa kahana he ki ye hathi, pani or bhojan kii talash main insaani bastiyon main aate hai
 He says, "trees of bamboo, fruits and other such things are being planted which fill their stomachs in the forest and do not come towards human settlements
 jangal main talab or pokhar bhi banaae ja rahe hai taaki inaki pyaas bujh sake
 According to Ram Prakash, the villagers are now being given other materials including kerosene with the help of which they can keep elephants away from their settlements
 unka kahana he ki halaat dhire-dhire sudhar rahe hai
 The stagnation in the number of those who died in the attacks shows that humans and elephants are learning to live together
 1990 ke dashak kii shuru aat main yahaan sirf 25-30 hathi hua karte the, unke hamale main har saal 27-30 logon kii maut hoti thi
 The number of dead has not increased very much in the last few years
 insaanon or haathiyon ke bich jari is jang main 2003 se ab tak ek darjan se bhi kam haathiyon kii maut hui he

 main kah saktaa hum ki narendra bhai sirf bijepi dwaara project kiye hue piem ke ummidavaar nahin hai
 Rather, there is hope, trust and confidence of the people of India
 or main yah bhi bataanaa chahta hum
 You all know that the Congress Government of Delhi has broken the trust of the people of the country
 55 varshon se adhik hukumat congress ne kii he
 This is no less time to make a population of 125 crores a great India
 magar congress ne apane shasankaal main garibi, berogari, kangaali ko badhaayaa he
 This is the biggest achievement of this Congress party
 isiilie main kahata hum ki is party ne is desh ke bharose ko tod diya he
 If it can be restored, only the most popular leader of the country, Narendra Bhai, can do it
 saadhe nau saal pehle mahangaai badhane kaa silsilaa shuru hua
 PM kept assuring within 100 days
 chah maheenon ke andar mahangaai kam hogi
 But it continues
 main aapako yaad dilaanaa chahta hum
 You have also seen a BJP led government
 atal ji ke shashan main chah saal main ek din bhi, aaazaad bharat ke itihaas main mahangaai ko badhane nahin diya
 Today i also want to say that this Bihar of ours is such a state
 jahaan kii 85 fisadi janata gaanvon main rahati hai
 If someone can overcome their poverty and unemployment, only the BJP government can overcome it
 ham jaanate hai ki bharat dilli, mumbai kii chaudee sadakon main
 Does not live in tall buildings
 yah gaanv gali main rahata he, jab iskaa vikaas hoga, tabhi swapn saakaar hoga
 i want to assure everyone that on the day the BJP government comes, we will work to improve the condition of the farmer who is the largest producer, consumer and consumer
 kisaan kii jeb main paisa hoga, to vyapaaree kaa vyapaar chalegaa
 The shopkeeper's shop will run
 doctor kii doctorl chalegi
 Advocates of lawyers will work
 puraa hindustan chalegaa
 Let me also tell you that i became the Minister of Agriculture in Atal ji's government
 maine nivedan kiya
 Atal ji agreed
 pehle kisaanon ko kheti ke liye 14 se 20 fisadi dar par byaaj miltaa tha
 i said where is this justice
 atal ji ne kaha, kam karo
 For the first time, farmer loans were made at the rate of eight and a half percent
 phir bijepi kii rajyon main sarkaar bani, to ise or ghataya
 Today many governments, including our Madhya Pradesh, are giving loans to farmers at zero percent rate
 isaki kalpana desh kya koi duniya main bhi nahin kar saktaa he
 i want to assure you why this formula is important
 bihar main kabhi akaal kabhi sookhaa pad jaataa he
 That is why we have decided that the farm income of the farmer should decide the puzzle of sowing the field
 yadi fasal barbaad ho jaati he, to jo khet kii aamadani buvaai ke pehle tay kii gai he, uski sarkari tantra dwaara adaayagi di jaani chahie
 We will improve the financial condition of the farmer
 agar ham bharat ko aarthik mahashakti bananaa chaahate hai, to yah jaruri he
 But this Congress government which has been ruling for 55 years
 karpshan ke nae record bana rahi hehamaare piem jis cheez par haath rakh dete hai
 Put your hands on the potato
 gaayab ho gaya
 Put his hands on the file of coal mines
 file gaayab ho gai
 He is the Prime Minister of such country
 aise hi gaanv kii rahane vaali budhiya ne, jab use jaankaree mili ki jis par haath rakh dete hai vah gaayab hota he, to vah piem ke paas gai
 When Manmohan Singh read it, it was understood that the old lady has a backache
 piem bole ise ek lakh de do
 He denied
 do lakh de do
 Then refused
 to doctor sahab manmohan singh ne poocha ki tumhen kya chahie
 The old lady said, i have heard, on whom you lay your hands
 vah gaayab ho jaataa he
 So there is a lot of pain in my back
 us par haath rakh dijie, dard chalaa jayega
 i want to tell the people of CBI
 aap pradhanmantri se kuch kahalava nahin sakate
 He will not say anything, then you will ask how
 ek yuvaraj kehete hai
 That the grandmother was killed by the people, killed the father
 ab mujhe bhi maar daalenge
 Hey i want to say that what has happened, the heart of the people should be the leading leader, like the Narendra Modi
 aapke paas espiji suraksha he
 If your life is in danger, then put the battalion of the country's army under your protection
 magar janata ke saamne rone kii, uski bhaavana kaa shoshan karne kii koshish na karo
 i want to assure you that BJP wants to take all sections of the society together
 bihar kii janata aap vachan dijie ki 40 kii 40 siten bijepi kii jholii main jaaengi
 (rajnath Singh's speech ends) It is worth mentioning that in the ancient times, the Pataliputra, which was the throne of power in Patna, was decorated in Patna, today there are two important pieces of the politics of power coming face to face with their own moves
 kuch vakt pehle tak endie ke sabase sthaayee gathbandhan sahyogi rahaa janata dal united unke naam par aitraaj jataate hue alag ho chukaa he
 In such a situation, this hunk is more against JDU leader and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar than traditional political opponent Lalu Prasad Yadav
 ye nitish kumaar hi the, jinaki jid kii vajah se bijepi ab tak narendra modi ko bihar main nahin laa saki
 But now the relationship has turned into a rage and the Bihar BJP is preparing to build its tone with the help of Modi raga
 agar aap kashmir aane kii taiyaari main hai to jaldi jaaie, kyonki asia ke sabase bade tulip garden ko aaj se aam janata ke liye khol diya gaya he
 It is a matter of hurry that you should not miss out on having more than 15 lakh flowers of more than 60 species
 duniyabar main mashhoor dal jhil ke kinare jabaravaan pahari ke kinare is tulip garden main phool khilne shuru ho gaye hai
 This beautiful garden is spread over an area of eight hectares
 is baar garden ko ek nayaa luk dene ke prayaas kiye gaye hai taaki zyada se zyada paryatak ise dekhne aaen
 Although the history of Dal Lake is centuries old, the tulip garden has been built only for seven years
 mahaj saat saal main hi isane apni pahchaan is kadar bana lee he ki ab ise dekhne log kashmir aane lage hai
 You can see more than 60 species of tulips together in the Tulip Garden at Sirajbagh in the area opposite Dal Lake
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki log baag kii saiyr ko rakhi gai fees dene main bhi anakani nahin karte
 Sirajbagh is spread over about 700 kanal area on the land between harwan-shalimar and Nishat Chashma Shahi
 yah teen charnon kaa project he, jiske tahat agle charan main ise 1360 or 460 kanal bhoomi or saath main jodi jaani he
 Initially it was called as Shiraji Bagh
 asal main maharaja ke samay garden vibhaag ke mukhiya ke naam par hi iskaa namakaran kar diya gaya tha
 But now it has become more known as Tulip Garden in place of Shiraz Bagh
 tulip garden main khilne vaale safed, pile, nile, laal or gulabi rang ke tulip ke phool aaj holland main khilne vaale phulon kaa muqabla kar rahe hai
 Flower lovers come here and feel like Holland
 bharat main sirf kashmir hi ekmaatr aisa sthaan he, jahaan par march se lekar may ke ant tak tulip apni chata bikherte hai
 It is true that till now Dal Lake and Mughal Gardens, Shalimar Bagh, Nishat and Chashma Shahi were the center of attraction of the visitors and Kashmir was famous for them all over the world
 ab in naamon kii fehrist main tulip garden kaa bhi naam jud gaya he

 AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi has said that Allah is the owner of mosques
 mahaj kisi maulavee ke kehane se masjiden kisi ke hawaale nahin ja saktin he
 His statement came after the statements of Kalia Sadiq, Shia religious leader and Vice President of India Muslim Personal Law Board
 sadik ne ravivaar ko kaha tha ki agar ayodhya main vivadat jameen kaa faisla muslimon ke paksh main aata he, to yah jameen hinduon ko de deni chahie
 He also said that if the verdict is not in favor of the Muslims, they should accept it peacefully
 masjidon kaa maalik moulana nahin balki allahowaisi ne twit ke jariye bataaya ki masjiden mahaj kisi moulana se kehane se nahin di ja saktin
 Their master is not Maulana but Allah
 ek baar bani masjid, hameshaa masjid rahati he
 Also, he said, mosques can be maintained by Shia, Sunni, Barelvi, Sufi, Deobandi, Salafi, Bohri, but they are not the owners
 masjidon kaa maalik to sirf allaah hihai
 He said, Mosques are built by those who believe in the Day of Apocalypse and fear only Allah
 saath hi unhone kaha ki masjid main namaaj padhanaa musalamaanon kaa kartavya he
 It is safe shiya central board ne sc main daayar kiya tha affidavinyodhya vivaad main 8 agast ko supreme court main sunwaayee hui thi

 Former cricket captain Kapil Dev is certainly relieved from his return to the BCCI but this great all rounder says that his return should not be considered an apology to the BCCI
 kapil ne ek khel megsine ke liye yojit kaarykram ke dauraan kaha, ‘‘main kabhi nahin samaj sakaa ki maafee shabd sahi he yaa nahin
 Maybe i am not smart enough but i also saw the dictionary to know what it means
 ’’ logon ne bhale hi indian cricket lig ke saath baagi shabd jod diya ho lekin is 53 varshiya ne kaha ki is anadhikrut lig se judana unke liye seekhney vaala anubhav rahaa
 The former Indian captain said, "people may think anything, but personally i have learned a lot
 ab main kaaphi anbhavi mahasoos karata hum, main apni jimmedaari ke liye ab aatmavishvaas se bharaa hum
 "he agreed that there was some misunderstanding with the BCCI but now it has been resolved
" kapil ne kaha, ‘‘main hameshaa maanata hum ki aisi koi bhi cheez nahin he jiske liye agar do log baithe or baatcheet karen to ise niptaya nahin ja saktaa
 The indo-pak issue can also be dealt with if there is proper dialogue
 ’’ tippaniyan Kapil said, "I have never disrespected the BCCI and it will always be my parent institution
" bataur khilaadi meraa lakshya khilaadiyon ke vikaas main madad karnaa tha
 When asked if he was expecting any special role from the board, he said, "I don't know
" is par faisla karnaa unka kaam he
 "kapil's first international captain Bishan Singh Bedi was also present on the occasion and he described this decision of BCCI as a fantastic news
 bedi ne kaha, ‘‘itane varshon tak kapil kaaphi tanaav main honge
 This was for a long time and was not needed
 kapil ab bhi bhartiya cricket main kaaphi yogadan kar sakate hai
 Kapil should understand that BCCI is still the apex body and should be respected
 ’’ purv captain dilip vengsarakar ne bhi bisisiai ke faisle kii tarif kii he
 Kapil said during an event organized for sports magazine, "I could never understand whether the word forgiveness is correct or not
 shaayad main kaaphi samajhadaar nahin hum lekin maine iskaa matlab jaanane ke liye dictionari bhi dekhi
 "people may have added the word rebel to the Indian Cricket League, but this 53-year-old said that joining this unofficial league was a learning experience for him
" purv bhartiya captain ne kaha, ‘‘log bhale hi kuch bhi soche, lekin vyaktigat rup se maine kaaphi kuch siikhaa he
 Now i feel very experienced, i am confident now for my responsibility
 ’’ vah is baat se sahamat the ki bisisiai ke saath kuch galatfahami thi lekin ab ye sulajh gayi hai
 Kapil said, "I always believe that there is no such thing for which if two people sit and talk then it cannot be dealt with
 agar uchit baatcheet ho to bharat-paak mudda bhi niptaya ja saktaa he
 '' Comments kapil ne kaha, ‘‘maine kabhi bhi bisisiai kaa niraadar nahin kiya he or yah hameshaa hi meri mul sanstha rahegi
 My goal as a player was to help the development of the players
 ’’ yah poochne par ki kya vah board se kisi vishesh bhoomika kii ummid kar rahe hai to unhone kaha, ‘‘main nahin jaanata
 It is their job to decide on this
 ’’ kapil ke pehle antarrashtriya captain bishan singh bedi bhi is maukey par maujuud the or unhone bisisiai ke is faisle ko shandaar khabar qaraar kiya
 Bedi said, "kapil will be under a lot of stress for so many years
 yah kaaphi samay ke liye tha or isaki jarurat nahin thi
 Kapil can still contribute a lot in Indian cricket
 kapil ko yah samajhnaa chahie ki bisisiai ab bhi sheersh sanstha he or ise sammaan dena chahie
 Former captain Dilip Vengsarkar has also praised the bcci's decision

 ayodhya main ram janmabhumi-babari masjid maamle main gaiyr vivaadit jameen par puja kii yachika supreme court ne khaarij kar di he
 Rejecting the petition, Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi said that you will not allow anyone in the country to live in peace
 kuch naa kuch aadchan daalani he
 The Supreme Court while rejecting the petition of Pandit Amarnath Mishra, also refused to stay the Allahabad High Court's ruling in which a penalty of five lakh was imposed on the filing of this petition
 ayodhya or babari masjid maamle main supreme court ke nirdesh ke baad madhyasthata se sulajhane kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 For this arbitration, the Supreme Court constituted a three-member committee and it is being monitored by cameras
 samiti ke adhyaksh supreme court ke justise ekhemai kaliphulla hai or isamen aadhyatmik guru shrishri ravishankar or supreme court ke varisht vakil shriram panchu shaamil hai
 Yogi Adityanath said on Ram temple, Hinduism will never give up the claim of Ramjanmabhoomi that the Supreme Court has given controversial 2
 77 acre bhoomi teen pakshakaron-sunni vakf board, nirmohi akhaada or ramalala ke bich baraabar-baraabar baantne ke elahabaad hoicourt ke 2010 ke faisle ke khilaaf daayar 14 apil par sunwaayee ke dauraan madhyasthata ke madhyam se vivaad sulajhane kii sambhaavna talashne kaa suzav diya tha
 Ayodhya dispute: On March 9, another petition was filed in the ramjanmabhoomi-babri Masjid dispute before the Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, member of the mediation team, on the question of Owaisi
 nirmohi akhaada ne supreme court main nai yachika daakhil kii thi or is yachika main centre sarkaar kii ayodhya main adhigrahit kii gai atirikt jameen ko waapas dene kii arji kaa virodh kiya gaya tha
 The arena had said that the Supreme Court should first decide the land dispute
 centre ke jameen adhigrahan karne se akhaada dwaara sanchalit kai mandir nasht ho gaye
 In such a situation, this land cannot be given to the center to be returned to anyone
 akhaada ne ye bhi kaha tha ki ramajnmabhumi nyaas ko ayodhya main bahumat kii jameen nahin di ja sakati
 The Akharas had filed this petition on the January petition of the Central Government demanding the Supreme Court to return the acquired land apart from the disputed land
 philhal supreme court ne centre kii arji par sunwaayee nahin kii he
 It is said that people who have the habit of staying in the headlines, do not lose their ardor even after coming to the shore
 teen maheene biit chuke hai, jab jairam ramesh ko rojaanaa ek surkhi dene vaale paryaavaran mantralay se hataakar gramin vikaas mantralay saunpa gaya tha
 They have been working day and night to make this boring ministry a flashy act in the eyes of the media
 par kismat ne unka bahut saath nahin diya
 Most of the headlines are given to him and he has been snatched away from them many times
 20 aktubar ko bangladesh kii pradhanmantri shaikh hasina jab teen bigha galiyare ke 15 minute ke jhtapat daure par ain to ramesh se unki agavaani karne ko kaha gaya
 Desperate to grab the occasion, Ramesh also prepared a speech in Bangla which was written in Roman
 lekin ain vakt par unhen bataaya gaya ki unki jagah swasthya mantri gulam nabi aaazaad ko bheja ja rahaa he
 Apparently, the Prime Minister's Office wanted a 'senior' minister to welcome foreign guests
 variyata kram main nahin hone ke baavjood ramesh mantrimandal main bahut teji se upar uthe hai
 After becoming a minister for the first time in UPA 1, he became a cabinet minister in UPA 2
 paryaavaran mantralay main unki andekhi karnaa aasaan nahin tha
 Due to taking half of his colleagues in the cabinet and Page 3 industrialists with him, the question of preference never came up
 unke nae karyaalay main zyada bade-bade log nahin aate, jis tarah unke puraane mantralay main aayaa karte the
 Nor is there any fun controversy
 ramesh ko cabinet darja dekar gramin vikaas mantralay main bhejne ke turant baad manmohan singh ne kaha tha, ''jairam ko zyada jimmedaari de di gai he, jahaan unki pratibha kaa behatar istemaal ho sakavga
 "the Prime Minister is not famous for saying Paheli Jumle, but he tries it when it comes to Ramesh
" ramesh kii pratibha kis tarah istemaal kii jaaegi, is bare main unhone vistaar se kuch nahin kaha
 But by sending him to a ministry that sees some of Congress General Secretary Rahul Gandhi's favorite projects — the Land Acquisition and Rehabilitation Bill and the Mahatma Gandhi Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MNREGA) —manmohan has cleverly decided that Ramesh is now Are part of Rahul's group
 bhale hi mukhar rahane vaale ramesh ab surkhiyon main nahin aa pate, phir bhi unhen koshish karne ke liye e grad mil jaataa he
 He has painted green paint in his new office, replaced the wooden door with a glass door
 lekin in baton kii koi charchaa nahin hui
 He then resorted to one of his favorite old tricks, that is, to jump into contemporary debate, especially in a debate related to a cause that is advocated by either Congress President Sonia Gandhi or his son Rahul
 haal hi main ek puraskaar vitaran samaaroh main, unhone artiai kanoon ke bare main apane vichaar jaahir kiye
 Confronting the Prime Minister, who had given a chance to revisit this law, he said, "some ministers understand that a lot of their time is wasted in dealing with RTI questions
" is kanoon ko naram karne kaa yah koi bahaanaa nahin he
 Unfortunately, the media did not pay as much attention to the Rural Development Minister's views on RTI as compared to some of his other colleagues in better departments
 team anna bahut utsuk thi ki may-june main baatcheet ke dauraan ramesh sarkaar kii team kaa hissaa bane
 But they were not included
 lekin isse ve thame nahin
 During the Ramlila crisis on 23 August, he surprised most of his colleagues by announcing that they would work on the Public Service Grievance Redressal Bill
 team anna kii maangon main se yah bhi ek thi, lekin yah jimmedaari carmik mantralay ke tahat aati he
 Ramesh said that although he has not been asked to draft it, he is preparing it on the basis of his total MGNREGA experience of 42 days
 agar sarkaar ko unka masauda kaam kaa nahin laga to ve ise apane mantralay main bhrashtachar par ankush lagane ke liye istemaal karenge

 Realizing the importance that Rahul is getting from the Land Acquisition and Rehabilitation Bill, he prepared the bill in a record two weeks time after assuming charge of the ministry on 12 July
 unhone uttar pradesh kii mukhyamantri mayawati ke liye bhi afat kar di or rajya kii manaregaa yojanaon main bhrashtachar ke bare main unki shikayaton par bhi chitthee likh di
 They all know the tricks

 During the hearing of the case related to money laundering, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) told the Patiala House Court on Tuesday that Vijay Mallya does not want to come to India but it is just an attempt to prolong his case

 lekin maalya ne ab tak duutavas se koi sampark nahin kiya he

 😉 @kirannagdev @veebha_ananda post shared bymanish Naggdev(@manishnaggdev) onfeb 17, 2019 at 12:49am pstmanira ne bataaya ki chaar saal ke relationships ke dauraan unhone sristi ko apni life, parivaar or personal kariyar ke sabhi maukey par shaamil kiya tha
 But he broke up with a phone call
 jab unhone sristi se milakar is bare main baat karne ko kaha to sristi ne kaha ki vah is vakt apane kariyar kii oonchai par hai
 She does not want to pursue this relationship any further
 or ab jab ve is rishte se alag ho chuki hai to phir baat karne ko kuch bachaa nahin he
 This breakup was nothing short of a shock for Manish
 manish ne 6 pej ke letters main apni aap beeti likhi thi
 Sachin Tendulkar and Rekha may appear in the last session of Parliament in their tenure as Rajya Sabha members
 basharte cricket yaa film kii koi majaburi unke saamne na ho
 This is because during their 6-year tenure, both were present in the House for just one or two days in all the sessions of Parliament
 yah maujuudagi isliye bhi rahe jisase unki rajyasabha sadsyta lagaataar bani rahe
 But as far as the question of the responsibility of an MP is concerned in the Parliament, both during their tenure did not give any preference to questioning, answering and making laws
 kya donon ko jisaliye 6 saal pehle manonith kar sansad bheja gaya vah makasad puraa hua?rajyasabha main bataur sadsy rekha ke 6 salrajyasabha website par maujuud aankadon ko dekhen to 6 saal ke kaarykaal ke dauraan rekha ne ek bhi sawaal nahin poocha
 Obviously when the question was not asked, there was no communication with them by the Central Government
 jab koi saansad sadan main sawaal poochta he to uskaa jawaab kendra sarkaar dwaara diya jaataa he or us sawaal-jawaab ko sansad ke register main darj kar liya jaataa he or saath hi use rajyasabha kii website par apadet kar diya jaataa he
 However, it is not the case that no initiative was taken by Parliament to include Rekha in the functioning of the House
 rekha ko sitambar 2016 se food, kanjumar afares or public distribution kii samiti main bataur sadsy shaamil kiya gaya
 The Parliament does not have any details of Rekha's contribution to this committee, obviously even here she did not understand the need to say or hear anything
 ise padhein: PNB ghotaale par sansad ke donon sadanon main joardaar hangaamaa, kaarywahi sthagitafilmi duniya main rekha hameshaa surkhiyon main raheen
 But his name was never mentioned in Parliament during his tenure in Rajya Sabha
 zikr hota bhi kyon jab unhone kabhi bhi saansad kii bhoomika main kuch karne kii koshish hi nahin kii
 Apart from asking questions in Parliament, bringing a bill by the MP is an important part of his responsibility
 lekin rekha ne apane puure kaarykaal main ek bhi bill sansad main pesh nahin kiya
 Now finally, Rekha's presence in the House is showing that her attendance has been the worst among all the nominated members
 unke kaarykaal main agast 2017 tak hue sansad ke kul 373 sittings main vah 18 sittings main shaamil raheen
 That is, his total attendance during the entire tenure was just 5%
 rekha ne sirf ek baar sadan ke satr main shaamil na hone ke liye aplicoshan di or na shaamil ho paane kii vajah film main kaam karne kii majaburi bataai
 However, for some sessions, she disappeared without giving any application
 haalanki rekha ne apane kaarykaal ke dauraan itani saavdhaanee barti ki unki sadsyta puure kaarykaal tak bani rahi
 According to the rule of Parliament, if a Member of Parliament remains absent from the business for 60 consecutive days without notice, there is a provision to terminate his membership
 lekin rekha kii atendence kabhi bhi 60 din ke is niyam ke khilaaf nahin gai or unhen puure kaarykaal tak saansad kii suvidhaayen milti rahi
 As a member of the Rajya Sabha, Sachin has the right to ask questions in Parliament for 6 years, so Sachin Tendulkar's record is much better than the line
 rekha ke shunya sawaalon ke jawaab main sachin ke record main 22 sawaal darj hai jinka byora rajyasabha kii website par shaamil kiya gaya he
 His questions focused on topics such as electrification of railway networks, inclusion of sports as a subject in the new education policy, and railway safety
 sachin ke in sawaalon ke jawaab main kendra sarkaar kii taraf se yoga or sports ko skool subject banane or sports ko complsri subject ke unke sawaalon kaa jawaab bhi diya gaya
 Sachin's questions were answered by the government in December 2015
 sansad kii taraf se unhen bhi information technology se judi samiti kaa 2016 main sadsy banaaya gaya tha haalanki is samiti main unke yogadan kaa byora sansad ne jari nahin kiya he
 At the same time, his name was never discussed in the Rajya Sabha
 ise padhein: cashles socity ko thenga, cirkulation main waapas ai notebandi se pehle kii puri karencijahan tak sansad ke atendence register kaa sawaal he sachin kii atendence rekha jitani kharaab nahin thi lekin unki atendence ko acha bhi nahin kaha ja saktaa
 In Sachin's tenure as of August 2017, he has been involved in 25 sittings out of a total of 373 sittings of Parliament
 yani sachin kii atendence kul 7 fisadi rahi
 On the lines of Rekha, Sachin also took such care during his tenure that his membership was never threatened
 sachin ne apane 6 saal ke kaarykaal main sansad ke lagbhag sabhi satron main ek se 2 din hajiri lagaai or kabhi bhi sansad ke satr ke dauraan lagaataar 60 din tak gaayab nahin rahe
 On the other hand, Sachin went missing giving information to Parliament 3 times during 6 years and for this, Sachin cited cricket matches and business busyness
 arunachal pradesh ke apane daure ko lekar china ke aitraaj par kendriya rakshaamantri eke antni ne 'hairaani' vyakt karte hue use durbhagyapurna or 'vaaki aapattijanak' bataaya he

 unhone samvaadadaataaon se baatcheet ke dauraan kaha, 'bharat ke purvottar ilaake ke sabhi saat rajya bharat ke abhinn ang hai or arunachal pradesh ke antni ke daure par china ko pratikul tippanee karne kaa koi adhikaar nahin he

 narendra modi ke haathon puure desh main aam chunaav main mili karaari haar ke baad aam aadmi party ke sanyojak, dilli ke purv mukhyamantri or vartmaan daavedaar arvind kejariwal ko jubaani jang main bhi narendra modi par hamale kii himmat jutaney main itnaa vakt lag gaya, tab sawaal he ki kiran bedi par hamale kab tak shuru ho paaenge
 
 
 On the other hand, senior leader of the party and one of the biggest admirers of Narendra Modi till now, Kumar Vishwas who is given the title of Jaichand, i
e
 Shazia Ilmi, she is also coming to the party
 aise main party chunaav prachaar main jin hathiyaaron kaa prayog kar rahi thi, unki dhar par thodaa-bahut nahin, bahut zyaada asar padana laazmi he
 Many people of the party are saying that some things inside will come out and the party is expecting such from Shazia
 shajia jis prakaar intervyuu main khuleam daawa kar rahi hai, use dekhakar to aisa hi lag rahaa he
 Like all the former leaders of AAP, Shazia has already described Kejriwal as a dictator
 
 
 to duusari taraf party ke vartmaan kartadharta ise jhuthalane ke liye tamaam bayaan jari karte rahe hai or ab bhi yahi karne main samay barabaad karenge
 With Kiran Bedi joining BJP in Delhi, everyone has started saying that BJP has run its Brahmastra against Aam Aadmi Party leader Arvind Kejriwal
 yani ab bijepi ke paas dilli main kejariwal ke jawaab main kuch nahin bachaa he
 Why is Kiran Bedi being called this? 
 
 yah bataane vaale kejariwal or bijepi main tamaam samanthaayen or antar bataane main lage hai
 
 
 Giving their own analysis
 
 
 koi kah rahaa he ki ab bijepi se kejariwal ko dikkat hogi
 The alleged experts are also saying that there has been some stir in Kejriwal's camp
 kai logon ko lagane laga he ki ab tak jo bhi prachaar kiya gaya tha, chaahe vah jagadish mukhi kaa naam lekar kiya gaya, satish upaadhyaay kaa naam lekar kiya gaya he, pichley chunaav main vijay goyal ko lekar kiya gaya, vijendra gupta ko lekar kiya gaya, saare prachaar, saare hathiyaar naakaam ho gaye
 
 
 Now Kiran will attack against Bedi
 koun-sa bhrashtachar kaa maamla laaenge
 
 
 Kiran Bedi was earlier in Anna's team, which also included Kejriwal
 ramlila maidan par pradarshan ke dauraan sarkaar par jab dabaav badha tha, usee dauraan kiran bedi par lage bhrashtachar ke aaropon kaa jawaab dene ke liye khud kejariwal or vartmaan team ke tamaam sadsy saamne aae the or seenaa thokkar unki eemaandaaree, bedaag chhavi or kaaryakshmata or raashtra tathaa samaaj ke prati nishtha kii duhai dete rahe the
 Now that Kiran Bedi has arrived in BJP and she is admitting that the party and PM Modi have shown great faith in her, then it is bound to be a wrinkle on the face of Kejriwal and now his team
 dilli main pichley vidhansabha chunaav main jab aam aadmi party kii hawa hone kii baat kahi ja rahi thi, tab party duusare number kii party ban pai thi
 Now that the entire country is becoming Modi-dominated in the Modi wave, Kejriwal's claim that he will form the government with 45 seats, seems to be much bigger
 kejariwal kii koshish he ki vah sarkaar banane laayak bahumat juta len, lekin ab unhen dikkat honi tay he
 
 
 He was already scared of Modi factor, many of his own colleagues were also assuming this
 
 
 do din pehle hi modi kii tarif karne vaale kumaar vishwaas party ke prachaar main dikhne lage hai
 Where Kejriwal has refrained from speaking against Modi in all the interviews, many times he went to the questions asked on Modi and started asking questions in response to the questions
 
 
 vahiin, kumaar vishwaas ne hamalaa shuru kiya he
 Modi's strength has been that he does not pay attention to such attacks and has been doing his work and people have liked the same thing
 may, 2014 ke baad se lekar ab modi par hamale karne kii himmat aam aadmi party ne jutai he
 
 
 Then think about how many days you can muster the courage to attack Kiran Bedi
 
 
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki tamaam kathith jaankaar kiran bedi ko 'bijepi ke brahmastra' kii oopaadhi de rahe hai

 Mankad dismissed Brown twice in that tour

 The government has not placed any condition to include the players
 ’’shahrukh khan ke khilaaf shivasena ke bayaan par unhone kaha, ‘‘pakistan yaa kisi bhi desh ke khilaadiyon ko ipel tiimon main chunanaa galat nahin he
 This is business
 shivasena ke paas koi mudda nahin bachaa, isliye usne shahrukh khan kaa mudda uthaaya
 Sports should be treated like sports and there should be no politics in it
 khilaadi kaa koi dharm nahin hota
 Deshmukh said that the proposal of the Commonwealth Games to be held in Mumbai was rejected by the Council of Ministers due to the 'disastrous state' of the treasury

 It looks like a fake copy of Kaylee's dress

 Please tell that Urvashi Rautela has been seen in many Bollywood films and item numbers
 urvashi ke fitness video soshal media par khub pasand kiye jate hai
 Urvashi appeared in Hrithik Roshan's film Kabil
 is film main urvashi kaa item number khub pasand kiya gaya tha

 When everyone was feeling that there was no scope for compromise now due to the discord of Samajwadi Party, at the same time Mulayam Singh made a special move to show the world that he should not forget that he was a wrestler
 dhobipachhad daanv ke maahir rah chuke mulaayam ne dikhaaya ki kushti kaa niyam he, jab tak pahalwaan khud akhaada naa chhod de, tab tak kisi ko nattejey par pahunchane kii jaldbaaji nahin kerani chahie
 History is witness that Mulayam is such a wrestler in the arena of Indian politics, it is difficult to speculate about which will be the next bet
 kya mulaayam ne diwaar par likhi ibaarat pard lee he or bete ke liye maidan chhod dene kaa faisla kiya he? yaa phir ye virodhiyon ko gachha dene ke liye diggaj pahalwaan kii chaal he? yaa ye umr kaa takaza he ki netaji 'ghadi main tola, ghadi main maasha' najar aa rahe hai
 Is this the reason why Mulayam is unable to understand how his frequent statements have made him a laughing stock? On Tuesday morning, Mulayam sent Akhilesh for another round of talks
 saath hi elaan bhi kar diya ki akhilesh hi mukhyamantri ke ummidavaar honge
 Know what are the 5 reasons which forced Netaji to be soft again
 1
 The image of Janamulayam, who was pushed to the margins, has been the image of a national leader who had the potential to become Prime Minister
 philhal mulaayam kii sthiti aisi he ki unke paas teen baton kaa hi sahaara bachaa he- amar singh, shivpal yadav or samaajawaadee party kaa samvidhan (jisaki wo kabhi adhik parvaah karte nahin dikhe)
 Akhilesh is now the unanimous choice of party workers and leaders
 akhilesh or mulaayam kii rassakashi main party ke 90 fisadi netaaon ne yuva mukhyamantri ke peeche jutane kaa man bana liya he
 The rest of those who are left will also take no time to ride Akhilesh's boat as soon as the last hope of agreement is broken
 chunavi ran ke samaajawaadee yoddha jaanate hai ki mulaayam ko sirf sahanubhuti mil sakati he
 But to win the election you need votes
 78 kii umr main mulaayam voton ko chumbak kii tarah khinch sake, ye sambhaavna bahut kam najar aati he
 2
 cycle par sanshayband kamaron main hone vaali baithkon main mulaayam beshak jo bhi daawey karen lekin 206 vidhayakon or 15 saansadon ke halafnaamon kii andekhi karnaa chunaav ayog ke liye bhi sambhav nahin hoga
 All these mlas-mps have supported Akhilesh in writing
 mulaayam singh kheme kaa chunaav ayog main sara daanv ek hi baat par tikaa he ki 1 janvari ko akhilesh kii ore se bulaayaa gaya party kaa adhiveshan avaidh or party ke samvidhan ke khilaaf tha
 However, Mulayam is also well aware that he himself has taken many decisions in the past in which the constitution of the party was not much cared for
 is baat kaa ishaara akhilesh khemaa chunaav ayog ko pehle hi de chukaa he
 3
 ummidavaaron kaa dabaavakadaake kii thand main bhi jab samaajawaadee paara ufaan par he, is tathy ko nazarandaaj nahin kiya ja saktaa ki parivaar ke ab tak ke sabase bade jhagade ke baavjood 167 ummidavaar aise hai jin par akhilesh or mulaayam donon kaa baraabar kaa bharosa he
 The names of all these candidates are the same in the lists issued by both the camps
 samay haath se nikalataa ja rahaa he, aise main ummidavaar chaahate hai ki mulaayam sulah karen jisase ki wo 'cycle' par savaar hokar chunavi ran ke liye kooch kar saken
 The election symbol of 'cycle' has become synonymous with Samajwadi Party over the years
 in sabhi ummidavaaron kaa mulaayam par dabaav he ki ve badppan dikhaate hue sulahanaame kaa elaan karen
 4
 mayawati kii vaapasi?siyaasi ranjish kahie yaa nijee str par naapsandgi, mulaayam singh ke liye mayawati ko uttar pradesh main mukhyamantri ke pad par dekhne se adhik kshtakaari or kuch nahin ho saktaa
 Mulayam is well aware that his family's quarrel will directly benefit 'enemy No
1'
 agar samaajawaadee party chunavi daud main pichhadati dikhaai di to muslimon ko bispi ko vot dene ke sivaa or koi vikalp nahin dikhegaa
 Mulayam may face the BJP government once but he will not tolerate seeing Mayawati as the Chief Minister
 5
 What all the drama? There is no dearth of people who seriously believe that this quarrel of the socialist family has been created and its script has been written by Khanty player Mulayam Singh of politics
 sirf isliye ki bete ke raajnneetik jameen par pair itane majboot jamaa die jaaen ki phir use kisi sahare kii jarurat hi naa rahe
 Those who believe that Mulayam will finally make sure that Shivpal, Amar Singh and Ram Gopal lose their credibility and get marginalized and only the shining sword of Samajwadi Party remains in the hands of 'tipu' (akhilesh's household name)
 And make him run as he wants
 kuch had tak amar singh, ramgopal yadav or shivpal ko chhavi par daag kaa dansh jhelana bhi pad rahaa he lekin chunavi prakriya shuru ho jane ke baad ab yaksha prashn ye he ki kya akhilesh apane boote naiya ko paar laga sakenge?sawaal kaa jawaab parde ke peeche chupa he
 At present, the process of such meetings is going on in which everything else is coming out except the result
 apana dal main maa beti ke bich siyaasi ghamaasan saaf taur par saamne aa gaya he
 Party President Krishna has removed his elder daughter and MP Anupriya Patel from the post of party general secretary on charges of indiscipline
 choti beti pallavi ko party mahasachiv banaaya gaya he
 All this has happened at a time when Anupriya Patel completely rejected the news of differences in the family a few days ago
 anupriya ne tab kaha tha, 'kuch samay se meri party or parivaar ko lekar bhraamak prachaar ho rahaa he
 Party and family are separate units
 agar kuch log ise samajhane main aksham he to ye unka sankeern najariya he, jisaki main ninda karti hum
 Significantly, Apna Dal's national president Krishna had nominated the younger daughter Pallavi as the party's national vice president, following which the party was constantly getting clarifications on the controversy
 is babat anupriya patel ne kaha tha, 'party ke samvidhan main upaadhyaksh pad he hi nahin
 ' railmantri pawan bansal ke bhaanje vijay singla se shuru hue railway ghuscand kaa jaal failata ja rahaa he
 The CBI has arrested Rahul Yadav, a colleague of Manjunath and Sameer Sandhir, a colleague arrested in the case

 bhartiya janata party (bjp)ne party ne congress ke varisht netaa pi chidambaram ko lekar kadi pratikriya di he
 The BJP said that it is shameful for the Congress party that a senior leader is behaving like a fugitive
 bijepi pravaktaa jiviel narsimha ne kaha ki lagata he pi chidambaram khudako vijay maalya or neerav modi kii suchi main shaamil karnaa chaahate hai
 The special thing is that former Union Minister p Chidambaram has not got immediate relief from the Supreme Court
 chidambaram ne supreme court main yachika daakhil karke antarim sangrakshan kii maang kii thi
 In court number three, a petition was filed before Justice NV Ramana and demanded a speedy hearing
 lekin justise ramana ne kaha ki vah yachika sijeai ko bhej rahe hai, ve tay karenge ki yachika par sunwaayee kab hogi? ab khabar he ki ismaamle kii sunwaayee shuukravaar ko hogi
 Meanwhile, CBI sources say that apart from Chidambaram's house at Jorbagh, raids are going on in many other places in Delhi NCR
 bataaya ja rahaa he chidambaram ko pichley baar saal isi cese main ek baar bulaayaa gaya tha auraveaaye bhithe
 On the other hand, why the CBI gave Chidambaram 2 hours notice, CBI has not given any reply on this
 sibiai kaa sirf itnaa kahana he kiye jaanch kii prakriya he
 On the other hand, after the ED, the CBI has also issued a Look Out Circular against Chidambaram
 aapako bataa den kidachhbhi tathaa pravartan nideshaalay (ED) ne purvakendriya mantri pi
 In the context of the petition seeking relief from the arrest of Chidambaram, the Cavites have been filed in the Supreme Court
 ab court kaiviet daayar karne waalon kaa paksh sune bina maamle main koi faisla nahin suna saktaa he
 Apart from this, the Enforcement Directorate has issued a lookout notice against Chidambaram
 idi kii team mangalvaar shaam kochidambaramke ghar pahunchi thim
 But Chidambaram did not meet at his home
 iske alaava sibiai kii team bhi unke ghar par mangalvaar shaam ko gai thi, unke ghar par nahin milane par sibiai ne unke ghar ke baahar do ghante main pesh hone kaa notice laga diya tha
 On Wednesday morning, the CBI team reached his home again

 Most of the country's businesses are in the midst of an undisclosed bandh
 aise main lagaataar is baat kaa intjaar kiya ja rahaa tha ki koi audyogic sanghathan turant yah akalan pesh karegaa ki desh main zyaadaatar kaam-kaaj thap ho jane se sakal gharelu utpaada (jidipi) ko kitna nuksaan hoga
 Also, this loss will be less or more than the black money collected
 lekin bharat band yaa majdoor sanghathanon kii hadtaal main usee shaam is tarah ke aankade jari karne vaale audyogic sanghathan is baar chuppi laga gaye hai
 They may fear that they may not be declared black money advocates
 ye surveykshan bhale hi ab tak na aae hon, lekin is tarah ke puraane surveykshan to uplabdh hai hi
 For example, in February 2013, when the labor unions called a nationwide bandh, the industrial organization Assocham claimed a loss of GDP of Rs 26,000 crore in a single day
 sitambar 2016 main hue isi tarah ke bharat band par asocham ne ek hi din main 16,000 se 18,000 karod rupee nuksaan hone kaa akalan jataayaa
 The gold loss strike against excise duty in the country itself gave an assessment of the loss of GDP of Rs 60,000 crore in 18 days
 yah bhi dekhne main aata he ki sansthaaen jitne nuksaan kaa anumaan jataati he, band ke baad vaastavik nuksaan kaa aankada aksar usase zyada hota he
 Looking at these assessments carefully, it is done in this that the year-long GDP of the country is divided by 365 days and Kazidipinikal is taken every day
 or nuksaan kaa akalan praaia: jidipi ke 70 se 90 fisadi ke bich aata he
 If we look at the present condition of the country, the work of daily laborers is badly stalled
 bazaaron kii raunak bhi jaati rahi he
 Instead of normal functioning in banks, the exchange of notes is taking place
 aise main desh ke 125 lakh karod ke salanaa jidipi (vartmaan mulya par) ke hisaab se ek din kaa jidipi 34,359 karod baithta he
 Daily GDP at constant price is Rs 29161 crore
 baithta he
 80 per cent of this was Rs 23,328 crore
 or 70 fisadi hua 20,412 rupee to agar ham 70 fisadi vaale nuksaan ko maanakar hi chalem to jidipi ko 10 din main 2 lakh karod se adhik kii chapat lagegi
 In a press conference on 11 November, BJP President Amit Shah also said that it would take at least 10 days for the banking system to get back on track
 teen din pehle hi biit chuke hai
 This whole game of exchange of notes is to last 50 days
 aise main jidipi ko 3 se 5 lakh karod kii chapat lag jaae to koi badi baat nahin he
 Now come to the question of black money being recovered from this whole campaign
 vitt mantralay ke hawaale se yahi kaha ja rahaa he ki sarkaar ko ummid he ki do se teen lakh karod rupee tak ke note number do kii kamai ke honge or inhen jamaa karne kii himmat koi nahin dikhayega
 In such a situation, the government will have the power to print additional notes of the same capacity
 sidhi baat kahen to agar sab kuch sarkaar kii marji ke mutabik hua to do se teen lakh karod rupee ke note arthvyavastha main mar jaaenge or sarkaar itane hi nae note chhapakar ise kalaadhan kii vasuuli maan legi
 Which is quite true
 yah rakam 125 lakh karod rupee salanaa jidipi vaali bharat kii arthvyavastha ke 2 fisadi ke kareeb baithegi
 This means that the country's GDP should increase by 2 percent through this campaign
 yani jitna kaala dhan milane vaala he, usase kahin zyada kaa nuksaan jidipi ko ho saktaa he
 That means the country, the country means 125 crore people here, this long campaign will not really benefit much
 jo karodon log in 50 din tak apni hi gadhi kamai ko hasil karne ke liye bhikhaari kii tarah kataron main lagenge, jin dihadi mazdooron ke ghar chuulhe nahin jalenge, ve isi mugalate main khush ho sakate hai ki unka chulhaa nahin jala to kya hua, kisi dhanna seth ke yahaan note jarur jaale honge

 The West Indies star of the spinner has increased difficulties
 darasal, pakistan super lig ke ek match main sunil naren ke avaidh gendbaaji ection ko lekar match ke adhikariyon se shikaayat kii gai he
 If Sunil Naren is found guilty in this case, he could be suspended in the remaining matches of the PSL tournament under ICC rules and there could be a problem of his playing in the upcoming IPL 11
 yah kolkata nite rides ke liye bhi bada jhatka ho saktaa he

 At present, it will be difficult to say who will be the new president of BJP in the state, but the discussion about many names in the political corridors is hot
 bhaajapa sutron kii maane to abhi kai netaaon ke naam aage chal rahe hai
 Whose will be crowned as state president, this will tell the time to come
 mayawati ne SAARC deshon ko lekar piem modi kii videsh niti par uthaae sawaal, kaha- padosi se jhagada kar koi nahin rah saktaa khushaek varisht bhaajapa netaa ne naam jaahir na karne kii shart par bataaya ki bhartiya janata party ko aisa netaa adhyaksh banane kii firaaq main he jo savarna or pichhadaa ke saath dalit vot bank ko sahejkar rakhe, lekin zyaadaatar chance savarna netaa ke hi ban rahe hai
 He told that the name of Dr
 Mahesh Sharma, MP of Gautam Buddha Nagar is also in the discussion at this time
 unke paas sarkaar kaa paanch saal kaa anubhav he
 He is also considered a person of the organization
 isi tarah upmukhyamantri dow dinesh sharma ko bhi sanghathan main laakar ek prayog kiya ja saktaa he
 General Secretary Vijay Bahadur Pathak is also considered suitable from the organization point of view for the post of president

 In Madhya Pradesh, the Congress has returned to power after a decade and a half, and in this success of the Congress, the tribal class is big The role has been there, but the party does not have a single tribal face whose identity is in the entire state and with the help of it, it can prepare its political ground
 lihaaja party ne adivasee netaa kii talash shuru kar di he
 According to Congress sources, the party is looking for a well-known tribal leader to keep tribal voters with him after the defeat in the Lok Sabha elections
 congress ke bheetar se adivaasiyon ko mahatv dene kii maang uthi he
 State Minister Sajjan Singh Verma has indirectly demanded to make Home Minister Bala Bachchan the state president
 vah bachchan ko ek anbhavi netaa bataate hai
 In fact, the state has about 22 percent of the tribal population
 vidhansabha ke 47 kshetra is varg ke liye arakshit hai
 In the 2018 assembly elections, Congress won 30 of these 47 places
 adivasee varg ke liye arakshit kshetron main 60 pratishat se zyada sthanon par congress ko safalataa mili thi
 Similarly, more than 25 percent of the 114 Congress mlas belong to this category
 modi sarkaar main mantri ramdaas athawale ne lee chutki, kaha- uddhav thakare 10 baar ayodhya jaaen phir bhi kuch hone vaala nahin havidhansabha chunaav main jahaan congress ko adivasee ilaakon main safalataa mili, vahiin loksabhaa chunaav main use is varg kii ek bhi seat hasil nahin ho pai
 The Congress has got only one seat out of 29 seats
 vah bhi chhindwara kii he, jahaan se kamalnath ke putr nakulanath chunaav jite hai
 For this reason, the Congress is trying to keep the tribals in its court
 rajya main congress ke paas kisi daur main dalvir singh, bhavar singh porte, jamuna devi jaise adivasee netaa rahe hai, jo satta main rahe to unki hanak rahi or vipaksh main rahane ke dauraan unhone satta paksh ko hameshaa mushkil main daale rakhaa
 But after the death of Jamuna Devi, not a single leader of this class has emerged in the Congress
 jo bade naam vaale netaa hai, unki khud raajnneetik jameen kamjor ho chali he
 People on the other hand lack the Godfather
 rajya kii congress raajnneeti main adivasee netaaon par gaur karen to sarkaar main mantri umang singaar, onmkaar singh markaam, vidhayak phundelal singh makare ke chehre saamne aate hai
 They are all new generation leaders
 party inhen main se us chehre par daanv laga sakati he, jo adivaasiyon ke bich sakriy he
 Another blow to Mamata Banerjee, BJP says majority analyst in Darjeeling municipality
 Soji Thomas says, "congress has had deep penetration among tribals at some time, it has vote bank, due to which it got success in assembly elections , But in the present era, the leaders of this class have not been given importance within the Congress, for this the leaders of this class are no less guilty because these leaders c has created a great distance from culture

 Taliban has again threatened Pakistan
 nae ultimatum main taliban ne kaha he ki teen dinon ke bheetar agar pakistani sena, swat ghati se nahin hataai gai to anjaam bura hoga
 Taliban commanders have said that the army should be removed from the north-western region ie Swat Valley within 3 days or else be prepared for heavy attacks
 pakistani sena kii talibani aatankwaadiyon ke khilaaf karrwai se tilamilaae talibani aakaaon ne di he teen dinon kii dhamkee
 tehreek-e-taliban (TTP) spokesperson Maulvi Umar has told the media that after three days we will destroy all schools in Bajaur area
 baad main swat ghati ke duusare jilon main maujuud skulon par hamale honge
 The ultimatum of the Taliban comes after the Pak army's operation in the tribal area of bajaur and a heavy attack in Khar
 pakistani sena pichley agast maheene se bajore main bade paimaane par oparation chalaa rahi he
 In which about 1500 al-qaeda and Taliban militants have been killed so far
 baavjood iske swat ghati se unka khauf kam nahin hua he
 In the last two years, militants have burnt down about 170 schools in north-west Pakistan ie Swat Valley
 lihaaja pakistan sarkaar or sena ke afasar is dhamkee ko gambhirtha se le rahe hai
 That is, the flourishing Taliban terrorists in Pakistan are now becoming a headache for the same
 gujarat vidhansabha chunaav kaa aupchaarik elaan to nahin hua, lekin raajnneetik sargharmiyaan tej ho chuki hai
 Where the BJP is trying to retain its power, the Congress is desperate to return to power
 iske alaava kshetreey partiyaan bhi rajya main chunaav ladane ke liye qamar kas chuki hai
 However, political experts believe that if the regional parties contest independently, then by dividing the anti-bjp vote, they can destroy the Congress's hopes of victory
 chunaav main mahaj do maheene bache hai
 BJP has been in power in the state for 19 years
 pichley do dashak main rajya main pehali baar aise raajnneetik halaat bane hai, jinke jariye congress ko apni vaapasi kii ummid dikh rahi he
 In the Gujarat elections, parties like NCP, JDU, Gujarat Parivartan Party and Bahujan Samaj Party have been trying many seats
 ye partiyaan siten bhale na jeet paaen, magar inhen mili vot chunaav nateezon ko prabhavit karte hai
 Gujarat Parivartan Party 3 in the last election
 63 fisadi or bahujan samaaj party ne 1
 It had secured 25 percent votes
 vahiin jediu ko mahaj 0
 67 percent of the votes were received
 waghela ne teesraa morcha banane kii kavayadacongress ke armaanon par pani pherane kii taiyaari uske varisht netaa raheshankar singh waghelane bhi kar lee he
 Shankar Vaghela, who revolted against the Congress last month, was believed to join the BJP
 lekin waghela ne bijepi jwine karne ke bajaae teesraa morcha banaakar rajya ke chunaav main utarane kaa man banaaya he
 Vaghela has named this third front "mass option"
 unhone kaha ki log bijepi or congress se ub gaye hai or ek vikalp ke liye betaab hai
 The resignation was given in the presence of BJP leaders, when Shankar Singh Vaghela was resigning from the Congress, the state Chief Minister Vijay Rupani, Deputy Chief Minister Nitin Patel and many senior BJP leaders were present
 bijepi netaaon kii upasthiti se is baat kaa sanket mila tha ki waghela bijepi main vaapasi kar sakate hai
 BJP does not benefit more than Congress that Vaghela could not join BJP
 lekin bijepi main unka shaamil na hona bhi ranneeti kaa hissaa mana ja rahaa he
 Those anti-bjp voters would go to the Congress camp
 waghela unke liye ek vikalp banenge
 In such a situation, BJP will directly benefit from it
 aap kii dastakgujarat kii jameen par kejariwal kii aam aadmi party kismat ajamaane utregi
 Kejriwal visited the state after the Patel agitation and the Una scandal and held huge rallies
 kejariwal ne rajya main naaraa diya he ki 'gujarat kaa sankalp, aap hi khara vikalp'
 Apparently Kejriwal's party is also eyeing the same votes, which are currently angry with the BJP
 yani aap kii dastak congress kaa game bigaadane ke liye taiyaar he
 The NCP, Shiv Sena and BSP will also field two NCP mlas and one JDU MLA in the state
 is baar bhi vidhansabha chunaav main ensipi or jediu maidan main utregi
 Apart from this, BSP and Shiv Sena are also making election preparations
 is tarah bijepi se naaraaz matadaataaon kaa bikharaav hoga or iskaa sidhaa phayda congress ko milane ke bajaae bijepi ko milegaa
 Separation from NCP will cost Congress: NCP was established in 1999 and the party in Gujarat in 2002
 71 fisadi, 2007 main 1
 65 per cent of the votes and 3 party mlas won
 iske baad 2012 vidhansabha chunaav main ensipi kii parformens main giravat ai par use mahaj 0
 Got 95 percent of the vote
 is chunaav main ensipi ko 2 siten milin
 It is clear from the data that NCP is very weak in the 182-member Gujarat Assembly
 magar, party zyada se zyada siton par chunaav ladane kii koshish karti he
 The Congress is out of power in Gujarat for 20 years, in such a situation, if it contests with the NCP, then it is possible to increase the vote share and seats of the party
 lekin ensipi or congress kii raah rajya main juda hai

 Media reports state that Emerson casualties have not occurred in the blast and he was safely evacuated from the scene

 chashmadidon ne api ko bataaya ki dhamaakaa us vakt hua jab emmersan ne raily main apana sambodhan khatm kiya gaya tha or podium se ja rahe the

 BEML President VRS Natarajan said, "it is unfortunate that VK Singh gave an inaccurate and surprising statement on the price and quality of the Tatra truck, which we have been supplying to the Army since the 1990s
" " General Singh had claimed that Tatra trucks sold to the army are not only significantly more expensive, but also not superior in quality and operation

 " general singh ne daawa kiya tha ki sena ko beche jane vaale tatra trek na sirf kaaphi adhik mahange hai, balki gunvattta or sanchaalan main bhi behatar nahin hai
 The general also alleged that a former army officer offered him a bribe of Rs 14 crore to approve contracts for the supply of 600 additional Tatra trucks to the army

 Natarajan dismissed several allegations leveled against the company by VK Singh and said that the company had no role in allegedly offering him a bribe of Rs 14 crore to approve contracts for 600 additional Tatra trucks

 Taking a dig at the ongoing debate about Lord Hanuman's caste, bjp's ally Shiv Sena said on Saturday that it is better that other characters of Ramayana also keep their caste certificate ready
 samachar agency bhashaa ke mutabik party ne is bahes ko bebuniyaad or niraadhaar bataate hue kaha ki uttar pradesh vidhansabha main bhagwaan hanuman par jati kaa thappa lagaakar nai ramayana likhane kii koshishen kii ja rahi hai or aisi koshishon ko roka janaa chahie
 The Shiv Sena said in an editorial in its mouthpiece Saamana, that a Ram temple is yet to be constructed in Ayodhya but a debate has started in the BJP over the caste of Hanuman, an avatar of devotion and loyalty
 bhagwaan hanuman ke dharm or jati par bahes karne kaa kya tuk he
 The editorial said that while campaigning in the recently concluded assembly elections, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had said that Hanuman was a Dalit
 iske baad kai anyon ne yah daawa kiya ki hanuman unki jati ke the
 After this, his party leader and councilor Bukkal Nawab said that he was a Muslim
 asal main bhagwaan hanuman kii jati kaa pataa lagaana morrkhtaa he
 The party led by Uddhav Thackeray said that Adityanath's cabinet colleague Lakshmi Narayan Chaudhary had said on record in the assembly that Bhagwan was a Jat
 shivasena ne kaha ki acharya nirbhay sagar maharaj ne daawa kiya ki jain granthon ke anusaar, bhagwaan hanuman jain the
 Saamna states that in this manner, new Ramayana is being written in Uttar Pradesh Assembly and caste stamps are being made along with its main characters
 ayodhya main bhagwaan ram kaa mandir banaaya janaa tha lekin ye log ram ke bhakt kii jati pataa karne kii koshish kar rahe hai
 It says, in this way they are making fun of Hanuman
 lekin jo log apane aap ko hindutv kaa sangrakshak kehete hai ve is par chuppi saadhe hue hai
 Had it been done by Muslims or progressive people, this Hindutva army would have created a ruckus
 shivasena ne kaha, haal ke chunaavon main bhaajapa ke haar kaa saamana karne ke baavjood hanuman kii jati par bahes jari rahane kii sambhaavna he
 Therefore, other characters of Ramayana should now keep their caste certificate ready

 taliban ke ek commander ne malala yusufajai ko ek chitthee likhi he, jisamen bataaya gaya he ki us par hamalaa kyon kiya
 Along with this, the commander also expressed regret over the attack
 kareeb 2,000 shabdon kii yah chitthee 15 july ko likhi gai he, lekin abhi yah saaf nahin he ki yah kahaan se bheji gai he
 According to the Daily Mail, in an attempt to assassinate former President General Pervez Musharraf, Wanted Talibani commander Adnan Rashid has written to Malala saying that he was shocked when he was attacked in October last year
 taliban ne hi pichley saal oktober main pakistan ke uttar pashchim swat ghati main malala par hamalaa kiya tha, jisamen unke sir main goli lagi thi
 She was then returning home from her school bus
 is hamale kii vishwa bhar main ninda kii gai thi or malala ko ilaaj ke liye britain airlift karaayaa gaya tha
 At the moment, her health has improved a lot and she is studying in the UK
 abhi unhone kuch din pehle neuyork main apane 16wein janmdin ke maukey par sanyukt raashtra ke ek sammelan main bhaashan diya tha, jisamen unhone sabhi bacchon ke liye muft shiksha ke adhikaar par jor diya
 In fact, at the time when Malala was attacked, Rashid was jailed for trying to assassinate former President Musharraf
 kuch din baad vah jail todakar bhaagane main kaamyaab rahaa
 After coming out, he learns that Malala has been attacked by the Taliban
 ab usne chitthee likhakar hamale ke liye maafee maangi he
 Rashid wrote, 'I was shocked to hear the news of the attack on you
 kaash, yah aapke saath naa hota, lekin maine pehle bhi aapako salaah di thi
 She has also said in the letter that she was not attacked because she wanted to go to school, rather she was speaking against the Taliban in Pakistan
 uske mutabik, 'main us vakt aap se milakar aapse kahana chahta tha ki aap taliban virdohi gatividhiyon se dur rahen, lekin mere paas aapkaa pataa nahin tha
 i was deeply saddened by the attack on you because we both come from the same Yousafzai tribal community
 'usne likhaa he, 'aapane sanyukt raashtra main die apane bhaashan main kaha tha ki talwaar se badi kalam hoti he, to isliye unhone aapaki talwaar ke liye aap par hamalaa kiya, aapaki kitabon yaa skool ke liye nahin
 According to Rashid, he is not against girls' education, but against Western education
 lekin iske thik baad raashid ne talkh mizaaj akhriyaar karte hue likhaa he, 'taliban kaa maananaa he ki aap jaanboojh kar unke khilaaf likh rahi thim or swat main islamic shashan sthapit karne kii unki koshishon par pani pherane ke liye ek abhiyaan chalaa rahi thim or aapaki lekhnee uksaane vaali thi
 'rashid has asked Malala,' Thousands of girls are going to school there before and after the Taliban rebellion
 kya aap bataa sakati hai ki aap hi kyon unki (taliban) hit list main thim
 He further wrote that tehreek-e-taliban is not the only reason behind the ruin of schools
 usne daawa kiya he ki pakistani sena skulon ko barrack kii tarah istemaal karti he
 Along with this, he has also said that Malala should return to Pakistan and get training in any madrasa
 usne likhaa he, 'main aapako ghar waapas aane, islamic or pashtun samskruti apnaane, apane grihnagar ke paas mahilaon ke kisi bhi islamic madrase main padhane, allaah kii pustak kaa gyaan paane, apni kalam kaa istemaal musalmaan samudaay ke bhale ke liye kaam karne or nai duniya ke naam par puri maanavtaa ko das banane kii sajeesh main lage chote se kuleen varg kaa pardaafash karne kii salaah detaa hum
 'significantly, Malala in her speech at the United Nations had appealed to continue working for the education of girls
 unhone kaha tha ki vah kisi ke khilaaf nahin hai or vah sabhi taliban, sabhi aatankwaadiyon or sabhi charampanthiyon ke beton or betiyon ke liye shiksha chaahati hai
 Malala said, 'I don't hate Talib who shot me
 agar mere haath main bandook ho or vah mere saamne khadaa ho tab bhi main use nahin maaroongi
 'malala, who went to Britain for treatment after being shot in the head last year, is currently in the UK with her family
 yah malala ke naam taharik-e-taliban ke commander adnan raashid ke mul khat kii prati he:miss Malala yousafzaii am writing to you in my personal capacity this may not be the opinion or policy of tehreek-e-taliban Pakistan or other jihadi faction or group
 i heard about you through BBC Urdu service for the first time, when i was in bannu prison, at that time i wanted to write to you, to advise you to refrain from anti-taliban activities you were involved in
 but i could not find your address and i was thinking how to approach you with real or pseudo name, my all emotions were brotherly for you because we belong to same Yousafzai tribe
 Meanwhile the prison brake happened and i was supposed to be in hiding
 when you were attacked it was shocking for me i wished it would never happened and i had advised you before
 Taliban attacked you, was it islamically correct or wrong, or you were deserved to be killed or not, i will not go in this argument now, let's we leave it to Allah All mighty, He is the best judge
 Here i want to advise you as i am already late, i wish i would have advised u in my prison time and this accident would never happened
 First of all please mind that Taliban never attacked you because of going to school or you were education lover, also please mind that Taliban or Mujahideen are not against the education of any men or women or girl
 Taliban believe that you were intentionally writing against them and running a smearing campaign to malign their efforts to establish Islamic system in swat and your writings were provocative
 You have said in your speech yesterday that pen is mightier than sword, so they attacked you for your sword not for your books or school
 There were thousands of girls who were going to school and college before and after the Taliban insurgency in swat, would you explain why were only you on their hit list???now to explain you the second point, why Taliban are blowing up schools? The answer to this questions in that not only Taliban in KPK or FATA are blowing up the schools but pakistanarmy and Frontier Constabulary is equally involved in this issue
 The reason for this action is common between them that is turning of schools into hide outs and transit camps once it comes under control of either party Pakistan Army or Taliban
 In 2004 i was in Swat, i was researching on the causes of failure of the first revolution attempt by Sufi Muhammad
 i came to know that FC was stationed in the schools of swat in tehsil Matta and FC was using schools as their transit camps and hid outs
 Now tell me who to blame???dozens of schools and colleges are being used by Pakistan Army and FC as their barracks in FATA, you can find out easily if you like
 So when something sacred is turned lethal it needs to be eliminated this is the policy of Taliban
 Blowing up schools when they are not using strategically is not the Taliban job, some black sheep of local administration may be involved to extract more and more funds in the name of schools to fill their bank accounts
 Now i come to the main point that is EDUCATION, it is amazing that you are shouting for education, you and the UNO is pretending that as you were shot due to education, although this is not the reason, be honest, not the education but your propaganda was the issue and what you are doing now, you are using your tongue on the behest of the others and you must know that if the pen is mightier than the sword then tongue is sharper and the injury of sword can be hailed but the injury of the tongue never hails and in the wars tongue is more destructive than any weapon
 i would like to share with you that Indian sub-continent was highly educated and almost every citizen was able to read or write before British invasion
 Locals used to teach British officers Arabic, Hindi, Urdu and Persian
 Almost every mosque was acting as school too and Muslim emperors used to spend a huge sum of money on education
 Muslim India was rich in farming, silk, and jute and from textile industry to ship building
 No poverty, no crises and no clashes of civilization or religion
 Because the education system was based on noble thoughts and noble curriculum
 i want to draw your attention to an extract from the minute written by Sir T
 b Macaulay to the British parliament dated 2nd February 1835 about what type of education system is required in Indian sub-continent to replace the Muslim education system
 He stated “we must at present do our best to form a class who may be interpreters between us and the millions whom we govern, --a class of persons Indian in blood and colour, but English in tastes, in opinions, in morals and in intellect”this was and this is the plan and mission of this so called education system for which you are ready to die, for which UNO takes you to their office to produce more and more Asians in blood but English in taste, to produce more and more Africans in colour but English in opinion, to produce more and more non English people but English in morale
 This so called education made Obama, the mass murder, your ideal
 isn’t it?why they want to make all human beings English? Because Englishmen are the staunch supporters and slaves of Jews
 Do you know Sir Syed Ahmed Khan, the founder and symbol of English education in India was a freemasons
 You say a teacher, a pen and a book can change the world, yes i agree with, but which teacher which pen and which book? It is to be specified, Prophet Muhammad Peace be upon him said i am sent as a teacher, and the book He sent to teach is Quran
 So a noble and pious teacher with prophetic curriculum can change the world not with satanic or secular curriculum
 You have given the example that once a journalist asked a student that why a talib afraid of this education he replied a talib didn’t know what was in this book
 The same i say to you and through you to the whole world that why they are afraid from the book of Allah because they don't know what is in it
 Taliban want to implement what is in the book of ALLAH and UNO want to implement what they have in man-made books
 We want to connect the world to their creator through the book of Allah and UNO want to enslave the world to few evil creatures
 You have talk about justice and equality from the stage of and unjust institution, the place where you were standing uttering for justice and equality, all the nations are not equal there, only five wicked states have the veto power and rest of them are powerless, dozens of time when all the world untied against the Israel only one veto was enough to press the throat of justice
 The place you were speaking to the world is heading towards new world order, i want to know what is wrong the old world order? They want to establish global education, global economy, global army, global trade, global government and finally global religion
 i want to know is there any space for the prophetic guidance in all above global plans? Is there any space for Islamic sharia or Islamic law to which UN call inhumane and barbaric?you have talk about attack on polio team, would you explain why the then American foreign secretary of state Henry Kissinger, a Jew, said in 1973 to reduce the third world population by 80%
 Why the sterilization and eugenics programs are running in different countries in one way or another under the umbrella of UNO
 More than 1 million Muslim women have been sterilized in Uzbekistan forcibly without their consent
 Bertrand Russell writes in his book the impact of science on society, "diet, injections and injunctions will combine, from a very early age, to produce the sort of character and sort of beliefs that the authorities consider desirable and any serious criticism of power that be will become psychologically impossible ”
 This is why we have the reservation on so called polio vaccination program
 You say Malala day is not your day it is the day of every person who has raised voice for their rights, i ask you why such a day in not assigned to Rachel Corrie, only because the bulldozer was Israeli? Why such a day in not assigned to Affia Siddique because the buyers are Americans? Why such day is not assigned to Faizan and Faheem because the killer was Raymond Davis? Why such a day in not assigned to those 16 innocent afghan women and children who were shot dead by an American Robert Belas because he was not a talib
 i ask you and be honest in reply, if you were shot but Americans in a drone attack, would world have ever heard updates on your medical status? Would you be called ‘daughter of the nation?would the media make a fuss about you? Would General Kiyani have come to visit you and would the world media be constantly reporting on you? Would you were called to UN? Would a Malala day be announced?more than 300 innocent women and children have been killed in drones attacks but who cares because attackers are highly educated, non-violent, peaceful Americans
 i wish, the compassion you learnt from Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him should be learnt by Pakistan Army so they could stop shedding of Muslim blood in FATA and Baluchistan
 i wish, the compassion you learnt from Prophet Jesus should be learnt by USA and NATO so they should stop shedding blood of innocent Muslims across the world and i wish the same for followers of Buddha to stop killing of innocent unarmed Muslims in Burma, and Sri Lanka and wish the same for Indian army to follow Gandhi jee and stop genocide in Kashmir, And yes, The followers of bacha khan, the ANP has an example of non-violence in their five years regime inkpk province, for example Swat, where a single shot was not fired and we witnessed the followers of bacha khan implemented the philosophy of nonviolence in its true soul, with support of jets, tanks and gunships
 At the end i advise you to come back home, adopt the Islamic and pushtoon culture, join any female Islamic madrassa near your home town, study and learn the book of Allah, use your pen for Islam and plight of Muslim ummah and reveal the conspiracy of tiny elite who want to enslave the whole humanity for their evil agendas in the name of new world order
 All praises to Allah the creator of the Universe

 The Naxalites do not miss taking possession of ration and medicines for their party
 duusari ore prashasan kii koshish hoti he ki gramin aabaadi tak khaadya saamagree or davaaiyaan surakshit rup se pahunchaa di jaaen taaki barish ke chaar maah adivaasiyon ko iske liye do chaar naa hona pade
 At present, the work of delivering Rashad in more than a dozen areas of Dantewada is in full swing
 monsoon ke dastak dene ke baad in sabhi gaanvon kaa unke jila mukhyalayon se sampark tut jaayegaa
 Therefore, the work of delivering the full four months of rashad is in full swing before the rains start in such villages

 The construction of the bridge over the Sonarpara river was announced by Chief Minister Raman Singh in 2012, but after the announcement, the entire process of bridge construction was put on hold
 isse logon main naaraazgi he
 At present, the tribals are happy with the provision of ration water for four months

 Bihar Staff Selection Commission (BSSC) chairman and senior IAS officer Sudhir Kumar was again questioned on Tuesday
 yah doosraa mauka he jab sudhir kumaar se is maamle main vishesh jaanch team ne poochtacha kii
 Earlier, he was arrested after interrogation of the commission secretary Parmeshwar Ram
 rajya sarkaar ne unhen nilambit kar diya he
 Meanwhile, the leader of the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party, Sushil Modi has demanded that the CBI should be investigated in this question paper leak case
 modi ne yah maang is aadhaar par kii he ki chunki is maamle main sattarudh dal ke kai logon ke naam aa rahe hai or rajya police kaa trek record rahaa he ki vah har maamle main rajnatik angel kii jaanch karne se bachati rahi he, isliye jab madhyapradesh ke vyapam ghotaale kii jaanch sibiai kar rahi he to nitish kumaar is maamle kii jaanch sibiai se kyon nahin kara rahe
 However, a day before Modi's demand, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar rejected the demand, saying that the state police is investigating and that no one will be saved or implicated in the case
 is maamle main karrvaai ho rahi he or sakht karrvaai ho rahi he
 Nitish said that no one has any specialization at any level
 police ko anusandhan karne dijie or sabko bharosa karnaa chahie
 The opposition says that such a big scam is being investigated by a team headed by senior Patna Superintendent of Police Manu Maharaj
 anusandhankarta rakesh dube par bhi modi ne sawaal uthaate hue kaha ki saadhe saat saal, jab tak bijepi rajya sarkaar main shaamil thi tab tak unhen koi jimmedaari kaa pad unke purv ke vivaadaaspad trek record ke maddenjar nahin diya gaya
 Now Nitish Kumar has given the responsibility of such sensitive investigation to such people
 tippaniyan In fact, in this case, the currently jailed Commission Secretary Parmeshwar Ram had said that he was under pressure from many people of the ruling party to clear his people in the examination
 iske alaava jis pariksha centre se yah puraa prashn patr li hua uske maalik ramashish raay ek jamaane main rajd ke adhyaksh lalu yadav ke jamaanatdaar rahe hai
 Despite the lack of recognition of his school, an examination center was built there, which is definitely a result of political pressure
 haalanki rajya police kaa kahana he ki puri jaanch kii kaman patna ke aiji nayyar hasanan khan ke paas he, isliye modi ke aarope tathy se pare hai
 But the question is whether Nitish Kumar will continue to face criticism in the light of the facts that come up every day on this issue or he will keep the opposition silent by giving the CBI the responsibility of investigation
 haalanki modi kii maang se ek din pehle mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne yah kahkar is maang ko khaarij kar diya tha ki rajya police jaanch kar rahi he or is maamle main na to kisi ko bachaaya jayega na hi fansaaya jayega
 Action is being taken in this matter and strict action is being taken
 nitish ne kaha ki kisi ko kisi bhi str par koi visheshta hasil nahin he
 Let the police do the research and everyone should be trusted
 vipaksh kaa kahana he ki itane bade ghotaale kii jaanch patna ke varisht police adheekshak manu maharaj ke netritv main bani team kar rahi he
 Modi also questioned researcher Rakesh Dubey that for seven and a half years, as long as BJP was in the state government, he was not given any responsibility in view of his previous controversial track record
 ab nitish kumaar ne itani samvedansheel jaanch kaa jimmaa aise logon ko de diya he
 The comments darasal is maamle main philhal jail main band ayog ke sachiv parameshwar ram ne bataaya tha ki un par sattarudh dal ke kai logon kaa unke logon ko pariksha main paas karne kaa dabaav rahata tha
 Apart from this, Ramashish Rai, the owner of the examination center from whom this entire question paper was leaked, has been the borrower of RJD President Lalu Yadav at one time
 unke skool kii manyata nahin hone ke baavjood vahaan pariksha centre banaaya gaya jo nishchit rup se rajnatik dabaav kaa parinaam he
 However, the state police say that the entire investigation is headed by Patna's IG Nayyar Hasnain Khan, so Modi's allegations are beyond the facts
 lekin sawaal he ki nitish kumaar is mudde par har din aane vaale tathyon ke alok main aalochana jhelte rahenge yaa sibiai ko jaanch kaa jimmaa dekar vipaksh kaa munh band karaayenge

 If the results are according to the exit poll, then Congress is not seeing any benefit in any state except Tamil Nadu and Kerala

 a major reason behind Congress President Rahul Gandhi contesting in Wayanad is also being considered that the entire focus of the Congress is now to make inroads in the states of the south as it has regional parties in North India like SP-BSP in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar In many other parties including RJD, it will not be so easy to overcome TMC in West Bengal and Biju Janata Dal in Odisha and these secrets Why, along with BJP, these parties will have to increase the vote bank equally which is not so easy
