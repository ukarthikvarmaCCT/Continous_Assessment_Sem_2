 The reasons for dismissing the decision of the Special Trial Court set up in Bengaluru on the order of the Supreme Court are the main reasons given by Justice Kumaraswamy: Comments - trial court ne jayalalita kii sampatti kaa aankalan sahi dhang se nahin kiya
 - The trial court admitted that Jayalalithaa spent Rs 3 crore on the marriage of her adopted son, but there is lack of sufficient evidence to prove this
 - bank se liye gaye lone ko aamadani kaa hissaa nahin mana gaya isse bhi sampatti kaa akalan sahi dhang se nahin ho paaya
 - Not only this, witnesses testified differently at different times, so the High Court cannot rely on their testimony
 aise main mujhe lagata he kii trial court kaa faisla kaanoon sangat nahin he
 Justice Kumaraswamy has explained his decision in 919 pages
 is faisle main unhone nichali adaalat ko aadesh diya he ki is maamle main jin chaar logon ko mujrim qaraar dekar unki sampatti japt kii gayi thi use foran waapas kiya jaye
 Now, the question arises that this matter of disproportionate assets worth about 67 crores has ended here? The case started with a petition by Subrahmanyam Swamy and the trial started in Bengaluru following a Supreme Court order on the dmk's initiative
 aise main is faisle ke khilaaf supreme court ke darvaaze khatkhatane kaa vikalp in donon ke paas to he hi saath hi saath abhiyojan paksh ke taur par karnataka bhi faisle ko supreme court main chunoti de saktaa he
 - The trial court did not properly assess Jayalalithaa's assets
 - trial court ne ye to maan liya ki jayalalita ne 3 karod rupee apane dattak putr kii shaadi par karch kiye lekin ye sabit karne ke liye paryaapt sabooton kaa abhaav he
 - The loan taken from the bank was not considered as a part of the income, even the property was not assessed properly
 - itnaa hi nahin, gavaahon ne alag-alag samay par alag-alag gavaahi di, aise main hai court unki gavaahi par bharosa nahin kar saktaa
 In such a situation, i feel that the trial court's decision is not statutory
 justise kumaraswami ne 919 pannon main apane faisle kii vyakhya kii he
 In this decision, he has ordered the lower court to immediately return the four people who had been confessed as accused in this case
 ab sawaal ye uthta he ki taqariban 67 karod rupee ke aay se adhik sampatti kaa ye maamla yaheen khatm ho gaya? is maamle kii shuruyaat subrahmanyam swami kii yachika se hui thi or diemke kii pahal par trial supreme court ke aadesh ke baad bengalooru main shuru hua tha
 In such a situation, both of them have the option to knock the doors of the Supreme Court against this decision, as well as Karnataka can also choose the decision in the Supreme Court as a prosecution
 aise main is faisle ke khilaaf supreme court ke darvaaze khatkhatane kaa vikalp in donon ke paas to he hi saath hi saath abhiyojan paksh ke taur par karnataka bhi faisle ko supreme court main chunoti de saktaa he

 lekin jaanch main is baat ke koi saboot nahin mili hai
 Both were caught near the loc on 21 September and now their return process has been started
 agar adaalat closer report ko maan leti he to donon ghar waapas laut sakenge
 Due to lack of evidence, the agency has decided to discontinue the investigation report against both

 Both Faisal and Ahsan will now be able to go back to Pakistan after filing the closure report

 ) hindustan ke pradhanmantri manmohan singh aatank ke hajaar jakhmon ke baavjood aaj pakistan ke pradhanmantri navaj sharif se milenge
 However, even before this important meeting in New York, Manmohan Singh has shown a mirror to Pakistan
 sanyukt raashtra mahasabha main piem ne kaha, 'pakistan aatank kaa garh he or behatar rishte ke liye pakistan ko in par karrwai kerani hogi
 The Kargil war in 1999, the Parliament attack of 2001, the Mumbai attack in 2008, the beheading of soldiers in January 2013 and the recent double attack of terror in Jammu, all these incidents have soured between India and Pakistan
 paak ko manmohan kii naseehat, rishte sudhaarney hai to band kerani hogi aatankwaad kii factrikitna acha hota ki aaj hone vaali manmohan or navaj kii aitihaasik mulakaaton ke bich aatank ke jakhmon kii tis na hoti, kitna acha hota ki hindustan or pakistan do padonsi mulkon ke wajire ajam kii mulaakaat se khushiyon ke paigaam aate

 Doubt is also in the heart of Pakistan and in the hopeless Hindus
 navaj or manmohan kii aaj hone vaali mulaakaat se do din pehle jammu main jis tarah sainikon or pulisavaalon ke khun bahaae gaye yaa pichley kai saalon se aatank kii goli se jo hajaaron bekasooron ke khun bahe hai, hindustan un sabakaa hisaab maang rahaa he
 The question is, when the Prime Minister of India Manmohan Singh meets in New York today, will Nawaz be able to give an account of those wounds? Manmohan Singh has made all the preparations to raise the issue of terrorism which is flourishing on the land of Pakistan in front of Nawaz Sharif and seeking answers from him
 But the question which has not changed for many decades, will that change now? kuch dinon pehle tak 5 janvari anoushka sharma or viraat kohli donon ke liye bahut special tha
 Actually, India's first match against South Africa was about to begin on this day and the digital trailer of the film 'pari' was also about to be released
 haalanki trailor 5 janvari ko relies ho nahin paaya
 The reason behind not releasing the trailer is being told to 'padmavati'
 reports ke mutabik, anoushka or produsar prerana aroda 5 janvari ko trailor isliye relies karnaa chaahate the kyonki is samay koi film relies nahin hone vaali thi, lekin padmavati kii relies date kabhi bhi anouns hone ke asaar he, isliye donon ne trailor 5 janvari ko relies nahin kiya
 The big reason behind watching every 16 movies of 2018, the team of 'padmavati' has not announced the release date yet and the makers of 'pari' have decided that the release date of 'padmavati' will be revealed Only then will he release the trailer of Pari

 In such a situation, Rajasthan will try to maintain a respectable position in the table by defeating the team of Daniel Vettori, who has lost the power after three consecutive defeats
 kolkata ke khilaaf eden garden main rajasthan kaa pradarshan behad niraashajanak rahaa tha
 Based on this performance, Warne can never think of defeating the Challengers
 aise main unhen apane saathiyon ko ballebaaji or gendbaaji ke saath-saath kshetrarakshan kaa bhi str uthaane ko kahana hoga
 Featuring legendary players like Tillakaratne Dilshan, Abraham de Villiers, Sourav Tiwari, Virat Kohli, Cheteshwar Pujara, Zaheer Khan and Vettori, the team has lost more than their bad game due to the good play of the opposition teams
 aisi sthiti main uske khilaadiyon ko apni kaabiliyat par bharosa rakhte hue pradarshan kii nirantarata ko banaae rakhana hoga lekin jahir ke netritv main team ko apni gendbaaji main jabardast sudhaar kerani hogi

 unke mutabik, ek baar saalon pehle boston gaya tha, vah vidwaanon kii nagari maani jaati he
 Took a street to show there
 patali gali thi
 It was told that it is called Banaras Street

 No, we have top most teachers of the university here
 ye vidwaanon kii jagah he
 Hence the name
 yah bhi kaha ki boston main ham log in teachers ko guru shabd se bulaate hai
 Modi heard the story, this is the influence and expansion of Banaras

 'azad reiterated that the sex ratio of male to male is increasing in the country and HIV prevalence in this category is higher than the national average
 unhone spasht kiya ki unki chintaa samalangik purushon ke paksh main thi naa ki unke khilaaf
 Asked about homosexual relationships being unnatural, Azad said, "everyone has a different perspective on this issue

 On the other hand, the Congress overcame Azad's statement
 party pravaktaa shakeel ahamed ne yahaan samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ‘yah aisa maamla he jis par swasthya mantri or sarkaar ko jawaab dena he

 Finally, senior party leaders have decided that we will reach a decision only after meeting with the leaders of Maharashtra Congress
 unhone bataaya ki party ne maharashtra congress ke varisht netaaon ko shaam chaar baje baithak ke liye bulaayaa he
 Let it be known that BJP will not form government in Maharashtra, it has now become clear
 aise main ab sabhi kii nigahen Shiv sena-congress or NCP kii taraf hai
 NCP chief Sharad Pawar has given a big statement about the possibility of forming a government with Shiv Sena
 unhone kaha ki ham sarkaar banane ko lekar koi bhi faisla congress se baat kiye bagaiyr nahin karne ja rahe hai
 On the other hand, the Congress party has called a meeting of the CWC regarding the current political situation in Maharashtra
 is baithak main party shivasena ko samarthan ko lekar party ke varisht netaaon se charchaa karne ke baad hi koi faisla legi

 Shiv Sena says that the agreement with BJP was done on this formula but BJP claims that no such agreement was reached

 After demonetisation, the manner in which fake currency has been consumed in India has changed
 dilli samet deshbhar main nakli noton ko pahunchane kaa root bhi ab badal diya gaya he
 Earlier, fake notes used to reach Indian markets via Nepal, UP, Kashmir and Bengal but now they are being sent to India via Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Malaysia and Thailand
 suraksha agenciyon kii maane to anderworld don daaud ibrahim in nakli noton ke kaale kaarobaar se judaa he or in noton kii chapai karachi or lahore main hi kii ja rahi he

 unhone bataaya ki suraksha agenciyaan lagaataar is network par apni najar rakhe hue hai
 Seeing the black business of fake currency being busted, the people associated with this gang have changed the route of these notes reaching India
 jaanch adhikariyon ne bataaya ki umdaa quality ke nakli noton kii chapai kar use bazaar main utaarne tak isaki keemat aadhi tak ho jaati he
 Fake notes reach India through three categories
 After printing, the printing of fake currency printing across the border reaches India through three categories

 Secondly, those who work as a link between ISI and Indian network for supply of notes in India

 According to sources, the isi's help to the people involved in the business of Toonkali Note is to destroy the Indian economy
 isamen sabase bada naam jo saamne aata he wo he anderworld don daaud ibrahim kaa
 With the help of ISI, fake note-books Ibrahim are spread in India, as well as terrorist organizations leave no stone unturned to harm the Indian economy
 nakli noton kii supplai pakistani khufia agency iesai apane network ke jariye desh ke vibhinn ilaakon main karwaati he
 According to the security agencies, the mastermind of the supply of fake currency in India is Iqbal Kana sitting in Lahore, Pakistan
 aatanki sanghathanon ke sleeper cell bhi is racket main shamilkana ko anderworld don daaud ibrahim ke gurgon se bhi madad milti he
 Not only this, people from sleeper cells of various terrorist organizations have also been connected to this network
 darasal ikbaal kaana neaiesai networkke jariye hi bharat main nakli note ke is kaale kaarobaar ko khadaa kiya he
 Let it be said that Delhi-based Parliament Street Police Station has been made a nodal station to report cases related to fake notes

 74 crores was recovered, while 27 after demonetisation
 95 karod rupee baraamad kiye gaye
 Delhi Police is also taking help of other agencies like IBI, Customs and Intelligence Bureau to curb the black trade of fake currency, so as to stop this campaign being run to spoil India's economy with the help of ISI

 As of July 2013, 114 incidents have occurred

 kendriya khufia agenciyon kii report chaunkaane vaali he
 a six-page intelligence report submitted to the Prime Minister, Ministry of Defense and National Security Advisor on August 30 revealed that the Bihar government was taking a soft approach towards the Maoists
 bihar se hi maovadiyon ke eastern rigen kaa control ho rahe hai? naksali bihar ko saat jone main baantkar kaam kar rahe hai
 On the basis of this intelligence report, Leader of Opposition in Bihar Legislature Sushil Kumar Modi said, "due to the soft attitude of Bihar government, the Naxalites have got a chance to spread their feet
" report saarvajanik hone ke baad bhi mukhyamantri jaankaree hone se inkaar karte rahe hai
 The joint team of intelligence agencies includes intelligence agencies such as IB and RAW
 jaankaar rajya sarkaar ke naram rukh kii vajah vot bank kii raajnneeti ko ginate hai
 The argument is that the whereabouts of the Naxalites are backward
 rajya ke 22 jile naksal prabhavit hai, jinamein darjan bhar jile ati samvedansheel maane jate hai
 The state government has been avoiding special campaigns against Naxalites
 uski mushkil yah he ki paryaapt sankhya main police nahin he
 Police presence in Bihar is much lower than the national average
 desh main prati ek lakh kii aabaadi par 125 pulicekarmi hai jabaki bihar main yah sankhya 84 he
 Shobhit Poddar, father of martyred Tandwa Police Station Ajay Kumar, also believes that the state government should change the policies so that posting of any constable and constable in the Naxalite police stations does not last long
 ve bataate hai, ''lambey samay tak rahane se ve log naksaliyon ke nishane par aa jate hai
 "A year and a half ago, his son was posted, during which he had cut the teeth of Naxalites

 Time will come, will be transferred
 padasthapit police bhi training or sansadhano ke abhaavon main kaam kar rahi he
 This is the reason why the state government has declared a reward of three to five lakhs on seven Naxalites
 par kisi kii giraftaar sambhav nahi ho pai he
 It has been seen that the action against the Naxalites has increased the difficulties of the common people
 isse bhi chintajanak yah ki police se zyada naksaliyon kaa bhediya tantra majboot ho rahaa he
 In November, the arrest of Sanjay Kumar Yadav, Assistant Commandant of crpf's 159th Battalion, suffered a similar setback
 sanjay pichley ek saal se naksal virdohi abhiyaan kii soochna li karata rahaa, jisaki vajah se kai police abhiyaan naakaam rahe
 On the situation arising out of the latest incidents, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar says, "police will speed up search operations against Naxalite organizations
" naksaliyon kii giraftaar ke liye bade paimaane par abhiyaan shuru kiye jaaenge
 However, Nitish believes that police operations are not the solution to the Naxalite problem
 unhone kaha, ''naksal samasya ke samaadhaan ke liye rajnatik, prashasnic or aarthik str par bhi kaam hona chahie
 Efforts are underway for this
 ''rajya sarkaar ne vampanthi ugravadiyon ke samarpan or punarvaas ke liye nitiyon main badlaav kiya he

 Aam Aadmi Party's national executive meeting has been called on Wednesday, 4 March

 The trust in us has been betrayed by the people of Delhi
 '' ye baithak garmagarm hogi is baat kii to guarantee he
 Let us now try to understand the nature and possibilities of this proposed meeting
 ho saktaa he yogendra yadav khud ko baithak se dur rakhen
 It is certain that Yogendra Yadav will be the target of everyone in this meeting
 baithak main wo tepe sunaaya jayega jisamen aap kaaryakarta or ek patrkaar kii baatcheet kii recording he
 One of the charges leveled at Yogendra Yadav is that he served in the media the news that the party was harmed
 ye tepe aaropon ke saboot ke taur par pesh kiye jaaenge
 Prashant Bhushan has refused to come to the meeting saying his predetermined schedule
 aise main yogendra meeting main akele pad sakate hai isliye dur rahane kaa koi bahaanaa nikaal sakate hai

 ho saktaa he yogendra yadav or prashanth bhushan ko political afares cameti se nikaal diya jaae
 As the news is coming
 inke virodhiyon kaa kahana he ki jab tak ye log piesi main rahenge, disturb karte rahenge isliye inase jald se jald nijaat paanaa hi party ke hit main hoga
 In democracy, before taking action against anyone, he is given a chance to present his case and Arvind Kejriwal is also a supporter of it
 aise main ye bhi ho saktaa he ki donon ke khilaaf kaaran bataao notice jari ho or unhen apana paksh rakhane kaa mauka diya jaae
 3
 ho saktaa he yogendra yadav baikfoot par aa jaaen
 Yogendra Yadav had said in a tweet on Monday, "'this is the time to do big things with a big heart after a big win
 desh ne hamase badi ummiden lagaai hai
 Do not belittle yourself and this hope with small antics
 " vaise to in shabdon ke saikadon myne ho sakate hai lekin agar inhen sidhe taur par samajha jaae to lagata he ki yogendra yadav jhagada nahin chaahate
 As they keep saying outside too, 'we are new now
 abhi ham sikh rahe hai' - or party forum main bhi isi line par kah den ki jo unke man kii baat thi unhone kah di bas, unka iraadaa na to party ko nuksaan pahunchaana rahaa or na kisi ko dukh dena
 With this, ceasefire

 Arvind Kejriwal may step down as the convenor
 ek twit main kejariwal kaa kahana he: ''main is jhagade main nahin paduunga, balki dilli main sarkaar chalaane par dhyaan duungaa
 Under no circumstances will the trust of the public be broken
 ' sambhav he kejariwal naye sanyojak ke liye party ke andar chunaav karaane kii pahal karen jiskaa shaayad hi koi virodh kar paae
 It may also be a democratic and political move by Kejriwal to ensure that all goes well
 5
 There may be some middle way out
 jis tarah kejariwal dilli ke mukhyamantri hote hue saare vibhaag manish sisodiya ke hawaale kar chuke hai, usee tarah wo party main kuch sah-sanyojak banaakar jimmedaariyaan unke hawaale kar den
 In such a situation, Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan should be offered the posts of co-convenor or senior co-convenor
 baat tabhi banegi jab inhen ye pad manjuur hon
 There is also a solution to some problems in politics that the solution should be postponed
 purv pradhanmantri pivi narsimha raav ne is formule ko khub applai kiya or unhen uskaa phayda bhi mila
 It is possible that Kejriwal should also take the path of 'weight and watch' in this matter
 vaise bhi kejariwal paanch march se ilaaj ke liye 10 din kii chuttee par ja rahe hai

 jammu kashmir ke rajouri main police or pradarshnakariyon ke bich jhadap ke baad prashasan kii ore se karfu laga diya gaya he
 The violence started with the burning of the flag of terrorist organization IS by some VHP activists
 iske baad ek gut ke log bhadak gaye or ilaake main hinsa hone lagi
 At the same time, Deputy Chief Minister Nirmal Singh has appealed for peace to both communities
 unhone jammu main samvaadadaataaon se kaha ki koi aisi sthiti main koi sampradayik tanaav nahin hona chahie, isliye ham donon samudaayon se shanti kii apil karata hum
 Whereas, District Magistrate Deepti Uppal has said that now the situation is under control
 vahiin, up mukhyamantri nirmal singh ne donon samudaayon se shanti kii apil kii he
 He told reporters in Jammu that there should be no communal tension in such a situation, so we appeal to both communities for peace
 jabaki, jila magistrate dipti uppal ne kaha he ki ab sthiti niyantran main he
 bjp's PM in waiting Narendra Modi has got a new supporter in the form of YSR Congress chief Jaganmohan Reddy
 darasal, jagan reddy ne ek press conference main narendra modi kii tarif kii or kaha ki unhen modi prashaasak ke taur par pasand hai
 Jagan Reddy said, 'I like Narendra Modi as an administrator
 main chahta hum ki modi desh kii vyavastha main badlaav laaen
 After this statement by Jagan Reddy, political mercury is set to rise
 raajnneetik jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki modi kii tarif main jagan kaa ye bayaan loksabhaa chunaavon ke maddenjar ahm he
 This can be seen by adding to the pre-election or post-alliance signs
 vahiin, modi kii tarif karke jagan ne congress ko ishaare hi ishaare main chetavanee de di
 It is also worth noting that in recent times, the proximity of BJP and TDP has increased
 kayaas lagaae ja rahe hai ki en chandrababu naidu kii party endie kaa hissaa ban sakati he
 In such a situation, the coming of Naidu's strong antagonist Jagan Reddy with the NDA seems to be far-fetched
 par siyasat ko koi sthaayee dushman nahin hota or na hi dost
 Jagan Reddy also claimed that his party is secular, and also advised all parties to pursue secularism
 jagan ne un afvaahon ko khaarij kar diya jisamen unke or congress ke bich deal hone kii baat kahi ja rahi thi
 He said, 'if there was any deal with Congress, then why did i stay in jail for 16 months
 mujhe bel isliye mili kyonki supreme court ne sibiai ko chaar maheene andar jaanch khatm karne ko kaha tha taaki main jamaanat ke liye arji de sakuun
 He said, 'YSR Congress we are against the bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh
 hamaari party iske liye hyderabad main 15 se 20 oktober ke bich baithak bulaaegi
 a special session of the Andhra Pradesh Assembly should be convened on this issue of our demand
 ' After the rebuke of the NGT, the government is making several efforts to rid Delhi of poisonous air
 isi kram main ab kejariwal sarkaar dilli main ek baar phir se od-ivan formula laane ja rahi he
 These are the 10 key things of the odd-even formula going to be implemented this time
 1
 This time the odd-even formula is being implemented from 13 November (monday) to 17 November (friday)
 2
 This time, women have been given relaxation in the rule of aud-even
 yani ve har din apana vaahan nikaal sakati hai
 3
 od-evankaa niyam subah 8 baje se raat 8 baje tak hi lagu rahegaa
 After 8 o'clock, every number of trains can run on the streets of Delhi
 4
 500 DTC buses will be arranged to make odd-even a success
 dmarsi ne kaha he ki wo bhi 100 basen degi
 5
 pichhali baar kii tarah is baar bhi ola or ubar vaale atirikt charge na vasulein,dillisarkaar is baat kaa bhi dhyaan rakhegi
 a meeting with ola-uber will be held in this regard on Friday
 6
 The Aam Aadmi Party government is going to implement the odd-even formula for the third time in Delhi
 isse pehle do baar or dilli waalon ne sam-visham kaa dhyaan rakhte hue apni gaadiyaan nikaali thim
 7
 saal 2016 main ek janvari se 15 janvari ke bich iskaa pehla charan or 15 april se 30 april tak doosraa charan lagu kiya gaya tha
 8
 paryaavaran visheshgyon kaa maananaa he ki od-ivan formula lagu ho jane se kareeb 10 lakh privet gaadiyaan sadakon se gaayab ho jaati hai
 Therefore, this formula not only reduces the traffic significantly but also increases the level of pollution in the city
 9
 The decision has been taken after discussing aud-even with the Traffic Police, Transport and Environment Department during a meeting at the Delhi Secretariat on Wednesday
 10
 For CNG vehicles, stickers will be available at each district's two CNG pumps
 CNG steekar dilli ke 22 stesan par kal dopaher 2 baje se uplabdh honge
 The odd-even formula will not apply to CNG vehicles
 ye he od-ivan kaa matlabod-ivan kaa matlab he ki aapaki gaadi kii number plate kaa aakiri number sam he yaa visham
 In this formula, there is a rule of driving vehicles on the streets of Delhi one day and even number the next day
 ganit kii bhashaa main 1,3,5,7 or 9 ko od number kehete hai
 Similarly 2,4,6,8 and 0 are called even numbers
 agar aapaki gaadi kii number plate kaa aakhri number od (1,3,5,7,9) he to aap 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11,13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29 or 31 taarikh ko hi gaadi chalaa sakate hai
 Similarly, if the last number of your car is even (2,4,6,8,0), then you will get 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16,18, 20, 22, 24, 26 of the month
 , 28, 30 can only drive the car out
 agra dharmantaran maamle ke baad se puure desh main is mudde par bahes chhid gai he
 The winter session of Parliament is also hot with this issue
 puraa vipaksh sarkaar ko ghere khadaa he
 The PM, known for his statements, has turned from "manmohan" in this case
 udhar ab shivasena ne kendra or bijepi kii niyat par sawaal khadey kar diye hai
 In the Sena mouthpiece Saamana, the bjp's central government has been raised in the circle of questions
 dharmantaran par saamana ke sampadakeey main hinduvadi sanghathanon ke utsaah ko saraahaa gaya he lekin sarkaar kii niyat par shaq jataayaa gaya he
 The Shiv Sena says that it is not so that this enthusiasm becomes a cause of trouble for the Modi government? The matter is not wrong, since the BJP government has come to the center, there are strong expectations of Hinduist organizations in the country
 har hafte sarkaar kaa koi mantri yaa phir koi netaa bayaanbazi se nayaa vivaad khadaa kar rahaa he
 The opposition, which felt itself weak in front of the government with a large majority, has been served by keeping the issues on the plate itself
 modi ab apni sarkaar ke mantriyon, saansadon or party netaaon ko phizul na bolne kii hidaayat de rahe hai
 Despite the opposition's demand, he is sitting silently on the issue of conversion
 uttar pradesh ke rajyapal ram nik ko bhi sampadakeey main jagah di gai he
 It is said about Naik, who describes himself as a priest of the Ram temple, that what is the harm in what Ram Naik says? Even though he is the Governor today, he is a volunteer of the Sangh and also a servant of the temple movement
 shivasena ne saaf ishaara kiya he ki jis tarah se hinduvadi sanghathanon ne dharmantaran ko mishan bana liya he kahin use sarkaar kaa samarthan to hasil nahin? darasal shivasena hi nahi balki kai logon ke man main ye sawaal uth rahaa he
 The government's silence is also suspicious in this case
 haalanki agra maamle main bavaal badhane par amit shah ne kaha tha ki balpurvak dharmantaran manjuur nahi he
 But in spite of which the preparations for the 'homecoming' in many parts of the country are pointing in which direction? desh ke share bazaaron main mangalvaar ko teji kaa rukh rahaa

 Former India opener Gautam Gambhir feels that it is sad to see Ambati Rayudu dropped from India's World Cup squad after just three failures
 saath hi unhone kaha he ki rishabh pant ko jagah nahin milane par koi bahes nahin honi chahie, kyonki unhone mili maukon kaa phayda nahin uthaaya
 Sunil Gavaskar was criticized for giving preference to veteran Dinesh Karthik over Pant and called it a surprise decision
 lekin tii-20 world cap- 2007 or world cap-2011 ke final ke nayak ne kaha ki raidu kaa somvaar ko ghoshit team main jagah nahin bana paanaa sabase zyada durbhagyapurna he
 Gambhir said on Tuesday, 'I think there should be no debate on the exclusion of Rishabh Pant, but the exit of Ambati Rayudu is a matter of discussion
 ’ bindaas gambhir ne kaha, ‘yah kaaphi durbhagyapurna he ki safed gend ke cricket main 48 kii ausat vaale khilaadi ko jo keval 33 saal kaa he, use team main jagah nahin di gai
 This is more sad for me than any other decision in the selection

 Gambhir was not selected for the 2007 World Cup in the West Indies and was considering quitting the game
 unhone kaha, ‘mujhe uske liye dukh hota he kyonki main bhi 2007 main isi tarah kii sthiti main tha, jab chayankartaaon ne mujhe nahin chunaa tha or main jaanata hum ki vishwa cap ke liye nahin chunaa janaa kitna mushkil hota he
 After all, it is a childhood dream for every young player to be a part of this big tournament
 isliye mujhe kisi anya cricketer se zyada raidu ke liye dukh ho rahaa he jinhen nahin chunaa gaya
 He has been the first captain of Pant's first-class cricket and he feels that his selection cannot be called a shock because he was not taken advantage of by the opportunities given to him
 gambhir ne kaha, ‘yah bilkul karaara jhatka nahin he
 Why is this a shock? He has not consistently been a part of white ball cricket
 use apane maukey mili, lekin durbhaagya se vah inkaa phayda nahin uthaa sakaa
 Therefore, it cannot be called a setback
 ’unhone kaha, ‘aapke paas abhi umr he, shandaar pradarshan karte raho
 He should not think too much about it
 On Karthik's selection, he feels that he has consistently been a substitute for the second wicketkeeper in odis, and in addition to experience, this also went in his favor

 He is also considered a better finisher, perhaps that is what he feels
 ’gambhir ne kaha, ‘lekin agar aap mujhase poochhoge to maine kaha tha ki meraa doosraa wicketiper sanju samson he kyonki mujhe lagata he ki vah abhi sarvshereshth main se ek he
 He has the ability to play at number four for a long time

 After the party's victory in January 1980, Indira Gandhi's PM was playing her third innings
 us vakt punjab main bhi congress kii hi sarkaar thi
 Indira did not have a political confrontation with Bhindranwale, her problem was political
 shiromani akali dal punjab main congress ke majboot vikalp ke taur par ubhar rahaa tha
 However, Bhindranwale's Damdami mint was accused of spreading violence
 desh kaa sabase samrudh rajya sampradayik hinsa kii aag main jhulasane laga tha
 On 5 October 1983, a bus was abducted by armed men and killed all Hindus on board
 indira gandhi is ghatana se agbabula ho uthin
 Emergency was imposed in Punjab
 afvaahen udani lagi thi ki bhindrawaale ko giraftaar kar liya jayega
 Bhindranwale started living in Akal Takht
 is bich, sarkaar ne swarna mandir kii gherebandi kii yojana banaai
 Operation sundown was discussed to nab Bhindranwale on the advice of the British government, but it was put on the back burner on the advice of Indira Gandhi after the casualties of common citizens
 may 1984 main indira ko yakeen hone laga tha ki punjab main aatank kaa safaya karne ke liye ab takaraav hi sidhaa rasta he
 After which he gave the green signal to Operation Blue Star
 haalanki is oparation kii keemat indira gandhi ko jaan se haath dhokar chukaani padi
 He was shot by two Sikh bodyguards on 31 October of the same year
 uske baad desh bhar main gussai bheed ne 8,000 se zyada sikhon ko maut ke ghat utaar diya
 Three thousand of them died in Delhi only

 Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale When Indira Gandhi was ousted from power in 1977, the most influential Damdami Taksal of Punjab chose her new Jathedar named Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale
 bhindrawaale ke shabdon main ajeeb sa jaadu tha
 His fiery speeches had a strange vibe but his thinking was very radical
 sikh sanskaron ke prasar or anukaran tak to thik tha lekin bhindrawaale gaiyr sikh ke bare main acchhee raay nahin rakhte the
 He had some similar feelings with the illiterate
 punjab kii sadakon par guton kihinsaam ho chali thi
 In April 1978, 13 supporters of Bhindranwale were killed in the same violence at the hands of Nirankar
 is ghatana ke baad bhindrawaale ne apane samarthakon se kah diya ki jo bhi nirankaari ko maut ke ghat utaaregaa, use wo sone se taul denge
 One of his gestures was willing to cut off his support
 algaavvaad kaa jehar bone vaale bhindrawaale ke bhaashanon ke casette punjab ke gaanv-gaanv main baante gaye the

 Praising the woman's move, Munde said that we want to build maximum number of toilets in the state and assure that women will no longer have to face shame
 -input IANS se Rating: 2 Stardirector: Pawan Kripalani Artist: Radhika Aptekai In films, the directors go to great lengths to test the patience of the audience, and so does the phobia
 lambey samay se hallaa machaa hua tha ki phobia ek lo bajet or thriller he
 The horror factor of the film was also being highlighted
 suspence kii baaten bhi kaaphi ho rahi thim
 Radhika Apte, who was in the news due to controversies, was being considered as the x factor of this film
 lekin jab film dekhi to yahi muhaavara dimag main gunjane laga- thotha chanaa baaje ghanaa
 The film is completely confuse
 diarector is baat ko samaj hi nahin paae he ki ve dikhaanaa kya chaahate hai
 Psychological thriller to say, but makes the head heavy
 kahani main kitna damafilm kii kahani radhika apte kii he
 Joe is a painter and does a great job
 lekin ek raat vah ek taxi driver ke saath kisi haadase kii shikaar ho jaati he or uski puri jindagi hi badal jaati he
 He has agoraphobia
 vah akele ghar main rahati he
 Does not go anywhere
 anjaan logon ko dekhakar ghabaraane lagati he
 Her family and friends try to help her
 jab koi nateeja nahin nikalataa to use akele ek ghar main rakh diya jaataa he
 Where she starts creating a different world and stories of her own
 use lagata he kisi kaa murder ho gaya he
 His neighbor is a murderer
 phir use apane dost par bhi shaq hone lagata he
 In many places, the film becomes a comedy type
 kul milakar diarector na to ise thriller bana sakaa or na hi aisi film jo baandhakar rakh sake
 The director missed making a great film
 star apilajahan tak acting kii baat he to film main radhika apte hi chai rahati hai
 Some artists accompany them
 jinke bare main jaanane kii zyada jarurat nahin lagati
 All the work is responsible for Radhika Apte, but she has been successful in that attempt as much as she could in a complicated story
 unhone darane, kanphyus hone or daraane jaise expreshans bahut achche die hai
 But in many places their expressions of laughing, crying and fearing seem similar
 kamai kii batkul milakar film us samay jigyaasa paidaa karti he, jab radhika agraphobia kii shikaar ho jaati he
 But after that the director does not understand what to show
 kabhi ve horer kaa tach daalane kii koshish karte hai to seen ko majaak main tabdeel kar dete hai
 Then they create some situations that do not connect anywhere, and our psychological examination begins in Psychological Thriller

 The promo video shows the question about Godhra in 2002 and the Prime Minister's reply on it
 16 second ke promo main piem modi kaa role nibhaa rahe vivek oberoi se patrkaar sawaal poochta he, aapane aaj tak godhra ke liye maafee kyon nahin maangi? modi kaa jawaab he, "maafee gunahagaar maangata he, kanoon saboot

 Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Sharad Pawar had claimed that PM Modi had proposed to work together, giving a special talk to NDTV India, saying that it was PM Modi's 'generosity' but my father 'politely' was declined
 unhone kaha, 'main is meeting main nahin thi
 It was between two superiors

 In Maharashtra, personal relationships are important even if there are ideological differences

 Supriya Sule further said, 'pawar ji is not just my father, he is also my boss
 or jaisaa ki aap jaanate hai ki bos hameshaa sahi hote hai
 Significantly, NCP chief Sharad Pawar had claimed in an interview to a Marathi TV channel on Monday that 'modi offered me to work together
 maine unase kaha tha ki hamaare nijee sambandh bahut achche hai or ve hameshaa rahenge, lekin mere liye saath milakar kaam karnaa sambhav nahin he

 Let us tell you that after several dramatic events, a government formed by congress-ncp and Shiv Sena alliance has been formed in Maharashtra and Uddhav Thackeray has been appointed Chief Minister
 rahul gandhi yaa narendra modi yaa phir koi or
 Who will be Alexander in the general election 2014 bet? When 'panchayat-aajtak' churned 100 days before the results of this Mahabharata, a wind of politics was seen in which the leaders candidly confessed that the era of traditional politics is over
 desh kaa yuva ho yaa mahila shakti yaa phir rupahale parde ke chamakate sitare, barabari ke haq ke saath raajnneeti kii nai dhara se judye ko bekaraar hai
 So, Rahul Gandhi's strategist and Union Minister for Rural Development Jairam Ramesh dismissed the politics of riots as "the 1984 riots are a stigma on us
" 1984 bhi galat tha or 2002 ke gujarat dange bhi
 "so Narendra Modi's warlord and BJP national general secretary Amit Shah said," We talk of equal development
 ham nahin chaahate ki sarkaar hindu yaa muslim ke aadhaar par chale
 The country has now moved ahead of such politics
 ”lekin jab darshak ddeergha main baithi ek congress netaa ne sikh virdohi dangon ke baavjood sikh samaaj kii congress ke prati aasthaa or bijepi se muslim samaaj kii nirantar duuri kaa sawaal uthaaya to shah bole, ''2014 main muslim samaaj ke vot se hi modi sarkaar banane ja rahi he
 While Jairam Ramesh denied Modi's clean chit from the SIT in the Gujarat riots case, Shah strongly objected, saying, "in the Zakia Jafri case, the SIT clearly said that there is nothing worth prosecuting
" is esaity ko gujarat sarkaar ne nahin banaaya
 The SIT report goes to the Supreme Court and it asks to be filed in the correct court
 loar court main faisla aa gaya, modi bari ho gaye
 Yet the Congress is polarizing by raising the issue
 ” lekin ramesh ne esaity report kaa ansh padhate hue kaha ki isamen bari karte hue modi ke bare main yah bhi kaha gaya he ki unki aapraadhik sanliptata ko nakaara nahin ja saktaa
 Shah aggressively dismissed allegations that Modi did not go to meet any riot victims after the riots
 ramesh ne pehle to is chunaav ko rahul banaam modi maanane se inkaar kiya, lekin prachaar abhiyaan main rahul ko pramukhataa die jane ke sawaal par unhone yah kaboolne se gurej nahin kiya ki congress apane pehle charan ke abhiyaan main rahul gandhi ko modi or arvind kejariwal se alag vyaktitv ke taur par dikhaanaa chaahati he
 Ramesh called Rahul a marathon of politics which is different from Kejriwal's 100 meter run
 is manch par raajnneeti ke nae jumale 60 saal banaam 60 maheene banaam 60 din kii charchaa hui to sawaal uthaa ki aakhir congress-bijepi or aam aadmi party (aap) main sabase behatar koun he
 Former Deputy Chief Minister of Bihar Sushil Kumar Modi clarified, "narendra Modi has given a general talk in his speech
 unhone 60 maheene main itnaa kaam karne kii baat kahi he ki logon main vishwaas aayega
 This does not mean that the country will be rejuvenated in 60 miles
 ”lekin gujarat model desh main laane par kendriya soochna va prasaaran mantri manish tiwari ne gujarat dangon se jodate hue kaha ki isse desh kaa satyanaash ho jayega, jabaki aap ke netaa rahul mehara ne bhi kaha ki aap ne 60 din kii baat nahin kahi, balki logon kaa vishwaas khatm ho chukaa tha jise jagaaya or ab log loktantr se jud rahe hai
 On this platform, political differences were clearly visible between Kavita Krishnan, secretary of the All India Progressive Women's Association, Mamta Sharma, chairperson of the National Commission for Women and Kiran Kher
 raajnneeti kii badali phija congress mahasachiv digvijay singh or rajyasabha main bijepi ke upanetaa ravishankar prasad ke vichaaron main khub chalki
 Namo Tea Stall or Rahul's coolie love, they both justified each other
 modi banaam rahul ke bich is manch par tisare morche kii sambhaavnaaen bhi talaashi gayi
 JD (U) president Sharad Yadav said that as the Congress has a tomb (gandhi family) on a tomb, now BJP is also copying it which is not its effect
 lekin use nahin bhoolanaa chahie ki duusare ke akhaade main koi nahin jeetta
 But why the Congress graph suddenly dropped and the party lost in four states
 kya mahangaai isaki vajah rahi? is sawaal par kendriya rajyamantri or rajasthan congress ke adhyaksh sachin payalat ne bebaaki se mahangaai ko kaaran ke rup main kabuula to unhone manch par baithe ensipi cote ke apane sahyogi mantri tarik anwar ko anaaj barbaad hone kii bajaae janata main baantne kii naseehat bhi de di
 When Union Minister of State for Planning Rajiv Shukla raised the issue of Yeddyurappa, bjp's Shahnawaz Hussain said that the Congress should not talk about removing tainted leaders as it would have to change the entire party
 aap netaa ashutosh ne dilli ke kanoon mantri somnath bharti par lag rahe aaropon ko khaarij kiya, lekin unhone mana ki bharti ke vyavhaar main dikkat he or unhen bolnaa nahin aata
 In the heated debate of politics, a slight softening was felt when glamor-ridden faces of different political parties came on the stage
 congress kii nagma, aap se kumaar vishwaas, sapa se raju shrivastav or bijepi se manoj tiwari ne party ke kehane par chunaav ladgaye kii ichha ko khule manch par sweekaara
 In a light-hearted atmosphere, Raju laughed a lot at the satire of Sonia Gandhi's son-in-law Robert Vadra, while entertaining Manoj Tiwari's songs

 Just the characters change
 aaj bengal main mamata banerjee kaa raaj he or saamne mukaable ke liye taal thonk rahi he bijepi
 The electoral and political atmosphere of West Bengal has been stained with blood since times
 1960 ke dashak main hi satta par dabadabe ke liye congress or left front main khooni jang tej ho gai thi
 In 1977, when the Left Front government was formed under the leadership of Jyoti Basu, after breaking the supremacy of the Congress, the Congress gradually shrank
 duusari taraf jyoti basu se lekar buddhadev bhattacharji tak left front 34 saal tak pashchim bengal kii satta par kabiz rahi
 Between 1977 and 2007, there were about 28,000 political murders in West Bengal under the rule of these leaders

 The opposition has suggested more than 250 amendments, but the headache of the government, not the amendment, is the daily commotion in the house
 enditivi india ko sanshodhan se jude dastavej mili hai jinke mutabik ab khaadya saamagree ke badale nakadi dene kaa praavdhaan bill main nahin rahegaa
 The government has also made it clear that the fixed quota of ration for the poor is not going to increase any more

 The film also stars Farhan Akhtar and Zaira Wasim in lead roles

 The success of both these films is proof that the reality is not only stinging but also selling
 yah is baat kaa utsahvardhak sanket bhi he ki darshakon kii ummiden bhi bad gai hai or ve ab asli nayakon ko dekhne ke liye taiyaar hai or yahaan tak ki nayikaayen bhi asli dekhnaa chaahate hai
 If bravery acts are shown on the screen and they are able to bring some tears to your eyes or wake up patriotic feelings, then even better
 bollywood ab aisi kahaniyaan sunaane main ji-jaan se juta he, jo use ummid he ki zyada samajhadaar hote ja rahe darshakon ko chhuengi
 That is why filmmakers are highlighting powerful characters and their inspiring stories
 abhi tak rujhaan yah rahaa he ki film nirmaataaon ne khud ko keval siyasatdanon tak hi simit rakhaa tha

 "biopics or biographical films are made largely from the personality of the person who inspired the film, or at least with the support and support of their family
" neeraja or aane vaali film sarbajit isaki misaal hai
 Director Umang Kumar knows how the biopic is woven
 apni pehali film main unhone dikhaaya tha ki mairi com kis tarah tamaam rukaawaton ko paar karke aakhirkaar olympic padak jeetne vaali mukkebaaz baniin
 For his next biopic, he met Dalbir Kaur, sister of Hindustani farmer Sarabjit Singh and recorded a conversation with him
 sarbajit ko pakistan main jasusi ke aarope main pakadakar jail main daal diya gaya tha, taumr unke sir par faansee kaa fanda latakta rahaa or 2013 main unki hatya kar di gai
 Kaur was attracted by Kaur's continued battling
 isi kii badaulat ve apane bhai kii rihaai ke liye akele apane dam par jang ladati raheen
 Kumar says, "it is important to win the trust of the subject or close relative of the story
 '' umang kumaar ne sarbajit singh ke kirdaar main randeep huda ko or dalbir cor ke kirdaar main aishwarya raay ko liya he
 Kumar feels that while making a biopic, the responsibility of the filmmaker increases even more
 ve kehete hai, ''aapako khaas taur par or bhi zyada satark rahanaa hota he, kyonki aap jis cheez par kaam kar rahe hai, vah aakhir kisi kii jindagi he
 While writing the screenplay, it is natural to tamper a little bit with the reality, but the important thing is that it is necessary to tell the person on whose life the film is being made, what cinematic misses the writer has missed
 
 sachaai kii takat is baat par bhi gaur karnaa jaruri he ki byopic documentry filmein nahin hai
 Madhvani says, "although i am interested in the truth of life and history, i am also interested in the truth of psychological and emotions
" ise dikhaane kaa ek tarika to yah he ki kirdaar ne aisa kiya tha yaa kirdaar aisa mahasoos karata yaa sochataa tha
 "madhwani said, the trick is to get the audience's heart pierced, but" without resorting to deception and dishonesty
 '' ve kehete hai, ''aap hansane, rone or mahasoos karne ke liye aa rahe hai
 You are not coming to say that the film was based on the right facts, but was a very bad film
 ''neeraja or sarbajit sareekhee filmon ke liye filmkaaron ko yaa to kalpana kerani padati he yaa najdiki rishtedaar kii baton par bharosa karnaa padataa he ki film ke mukhya kirdaar par kya gujri thi
 This is not the case with films made on celebrities like Indian cricket team captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Mohammad Azharuddin
 jane-pahachaane rahasyon kaa khulaasalokapriy shakhsiyat par film bananaa dodhari talwaar bhi ho sakati he
 On the one hand, it becomes easier to sell films made on Dhoni and Azharuddin than on Manjhi, a mountain man (2015) or Shahid (2014), a lawyer who litigated people involved in false allegations

 imran hashmi kii adaakaari se saji ajahar ke lekhak rajat aroda ise badi chunauti maanate hai
 Azhar's self-proclaimed fan, Arora, says that it is extremely important that the writer does not 'come into the lure of the corridor' and 'look for the person behind that personality
 '' aroda ne ajaharuddin se 'vyavhaar ke bare main poochne ke liye nahin, balki unhen prerit karne vaali baton ko samajhane ke liye' mulaakaaten kin
 In every meeting one after the other, Arora came to know about the "many complexities" of the former captain's personality, as layers of the story opened up
 isi vajah se yah puri prakriya bhi dilachasp ho gai

 In the 60 years of political life of late DMK leader m Karunanidhi, there have been many big developments
 lekin unke raajnneetik safar ke do maukey- pehla 1972 main diemke se em ji ramchandran (mjiaar) kaa bedakhal hona or doosraa 1979 main ediemke kaa diemke main vilay kaa prayaas ahm hai
 Yes, this effort, which seems almost impossible in today's era, was almost made possible in 1979 by Biju Patnaik, father of former Union Minister and Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik
 yah wo daur tha jab centre main pehali baar gaiyr congressi sarkaar bani thi or rajyon kii raajnneeti main anischitata thi
 In this era, Karunanidhi was an outspoken advocate for the autonomy of the states
 bataa den ki abhinayta se netaa bane mjiaar ne 1972 main karunanidhi se matbhed ke chalate ediemke kii sthapana kii thi
 mgr's AIADMK came to power in Tamil Nadu five years after the party was founded
 mjiaar ne centre main charan singh sarkaar kaa samarthan kiya tha or jab aglaa chunaav sir par tha tab indira gandhi sambhavit vaapasi ko dekhte hue mjiaar unke sampark main aa gaye
 But when the proposed meeting of Indira and MGR was not possible, then Biju Patnaik, a minister in the Charan Singh government, proposed the merger of DMK and AIADMK
 patnayak ke is prastaav par jab karunanidhi ne poocha ki iske peeche koun he? tab patnayak ne jawaab diya ki mjiaar aisa chaahate hai or is par aapaki raay kya he yah bhi jaananaa chaahate hai
 Karunanidhi agreed on the condition that the dmk's name be retained while the aiadmk's flag would be
 karunanidhi kaa yah bhi kahana tha ki vilay ke baad mjiaar mukhyamantri bane rah sakate hai jabaki party kii kaman karunanidhi ke paas rahegi
 After which Patnaik held a meeting of the heads of both the parties at Chepak Guest House
 is maukey par diemke ke mahasachiv ke anabajhagan or ediemke ke mahasachiv ve aar nedunchesiyaan va pi ramchandran maujuud the
 While MGGR and Karunanidhikay had a closed room meeting
 donon netaaon ne ek samjhaute par sahamat hone ke baad party kaaryakarini kii ek apaat baithak bulaane kaa nirnay liya jisamen donon dalo ke vilay sambandhi prastaav paarit hona tha
 But mgr's views changed a few hours later when MGR did not say anything about the merger with the platform at a public meeting in Vellore but other AIADMK leaders criticized the DMK
 isi ke saath vilay kaa yah adhyay bhi samaapt ho gaya
 In 2009, 30 years after this meeting with MGR, Karunanidhi had revealed on one occasion that the cabinet minister of MGR was the one who dumped the plans of the merger
 karunanidhi ne yah bhi kaha tha ki unhen shaq he ki mjiaar ke baithak se vellore jansabha main jane ke bich hi aisa hua hoga
 AIADMK leader p Ramachandran, who was present in this meeting, claimed that he changed the views of MGR saying that after the merger of the two parties, the AIADMK cadres will be of no importance
 ramchandran kii yah baat mjiaar ke samaj main aa gai or unhone vilay kaa vichaar tyaag diya

 • The Rajasthan government also wanted officers and judges to be asked before writing the news
 loktantr kii buniyaad badalane kii yah koshish bhi antat: khet rahi
 • And most importantly, despite the majority, the government, afraid of the opposition's no-confidence motion, lost the entire session of Parliament but did not allow the opposition to exercise the right to move a no-confidence motion

 However, some reports also say that both can marry in Mumbai instead of Italy

 Despite the harsh stand taken by the Supreme Court on the Khap Panchayats, the representatives of the Khap Panchayats are not willing to accept the marriage in a village and a gotra and the marriage against the will of the parents under any circumstances

 The court said that this complaint was premature because the film was not made then and secondly, if there is something objectionable in the film, then the censor board will decide whether the film is released or not
 agar phir bhi kisi ko lagata he film main kuch aapattijanak he to aap sensor board ke certificate ko chalange kar sakate hai, lekin is tarah se report nahin darj karvaa sakate hai
 The High Court also held that Rani Padmini was not a religious figure, but a historical character
 isliye dharmik bhaawanaaon ko thes pahunchane kaa maamla nahin banataa he
 The Censor Board is an independent body and has given a certificate after viewing everything
 agar usamen kisi ko objection he to usko chalange kar saktaa he

 matoshri thakare parivaar kaa garh he vahi thakare parivaar jisaki teesri peedi ke rup main kal aditya thakare ko shivasena kii kor team main shaamil kar liya gaya
 But would you believe that the most powerful political family in Maharashtra started not with Matoshree but with a trick
 us chaal kaa naam he miranda chaal
 Which is still in Dadar
 bal thakare ke pita prabodhankaar thakare ne apni jeevani majhi jeevanagaatha main likhaa he ki unke paas miranda chaal main ground par do floor the
 This trick is more than a hundred years old, now only half a house remains in its old form
 zyaadaatar logon ne gharon ke andar badlaav kiye he
 The outside structure where previously used to be completely wooden, has now been made mostly of iron
 par kuch hissaa bilkul vaisaa hi he
 Chal has 10 * 10 rooms
 gharon ke andar van room kichan hota he
 But the bathroom is one among all families
 miranda chaal ground plus 2 kaa strecchar he
 There is a bathroom on every floor here
 dakshin bharatiyon se nafrat ke bijprabodhankaar thakare us daur ke bade soshal riformist the or marathi naatak bhi likhaa karte the
 But that income was not able to be fulfilled to raise the family
 isliye der raat tak jaag-jagakar prabodhankaar alag se typing kaa kaam karte the
 So much so that his eyes were screwed up by typing
 us vakt miranda chaal main pehle zyaadaatar malayalam or tamil log rahete the
 Enlightenment Thackeray tells in his autobiography 'majhi Jeevanagatha' that the Thackeray family had a quarrel over the habit of applying oil before bathing with the South Indians living in Mirada Chawl
 chol main sabake liye kaaman bollroom hota he
 Taking a bath with oil, Prabodhan Thackeray used to think that later people taking bath can slip into the bathroom
 lekin chol nivasee unki baat nahin sunate the or kehete the ki tel lagaakar nahaana to dakshin bharat main rivaaj he
 To teach them a lesson, the Thackeray family started placing meat pieces in front of their house
 isse unke shaakaahaari padosi naaraaz ho gaye
 When he objected, it was said on behalf of the Thackeray family that this is our custom
 mana jaataa he ki dakshin bharatiyon ke khilaaf unke man main beej yaheen se pade the
 After the formation of the Shiv Sena, Bal Thackeray gave the slogan against the South Indians
 miranda chaal main rahane vaale kisi bujurg ne bhi apni ankhon se thakare parivaar ko yahaan rahete nahin dekha par sabane apane maa-baap, dada-daadi ke munh se unke yahaan rahane ke kissa jarur sune he
 After leaving Miranda Chawl, Bal Thackeray or no family member ever came here
 lekin chaal ke log bade garv se bataate hai ki ek jamaane main wo thakare parivaar ke saath rahete the
 Bal Thackeray and telephone directory Bal Thackeray's larger than life image
 aisa shaks jisaki mumbai main tuuti bolti thi
 It was such that no contemporary leader was far away from him
 ek rajnatik party kaa adhyaksh jo badi dhamak ke saath kahata tha ki uskaa loktantr main vishwaas nahin he
 If he gets enough, then he runs the country with impunity
 dekhne laayak rutabe or laav lashkar ke saath chalane vaale bala sahib kii apbringing bilkul lor middle class maahaul main hui
 Bal Thackeray was an average student in reading but was very creative
 bahut achche cartoon banaaya karte the
 They used to keep a hold on what is going on in the world, they were very anti-communists
 bala sahib kii jab free press jarnal main naukari lagi phir phir unhone apni megsine maarmik shuru kii
 It is here that major changes started in his life as well
 kehete hai ki ek din bala sahib ne gaur se mumbai kii telephone doirectory ko dekha
 In which the names of the Marathas were numbered and the entire telephone directory was filled with the names of South Indians
 zyaadaatar sarkari naukariyon par us samay mumbai main dakshin bharatiyon kaa kabja tha
 Telephone was a status symbol in those days
 mubain main marathiyon kii sankhya bhale hi zyada thi par SON OF THE SOIL hote hue unki ginati ilit class main nahin the
 Marathi was more into lower class works
 jabaki taai lagaakar offis jane vaale south indian the
 Bala Saheb was very shocked
 maarmik ke jariye marathi yuvaaon tak pahunchatelephone doirectory se saaf tha ki mumbai main sarkari naukariyon par bahriyon yani dakshin bharatiyon kaa kabja tha or marathiyon ke hisse main sirf nichle darje, lo class ke kaam the
 Thackeray said this thing like a Nashtar
 unhone maarmik main dakshin bharatiyon ke naam or unke padon kii detel chhaapi
 In the caption below, 'read and shut up' (covenant on Thand Basa)
 kuch dinon tak bala sahib alag alag sarkari vibhaagon or usamen kaam karne vaale dakshin bharatiyon ke naam kii list chhapate rahe
 Gradually this thing started to boil the blood of unemployed Marathi youth
 maarmik main chhapane vaali list se unhen yakeen hone laga ki dakshin bhartiya unki naukariyaan kha rahe hai
 Bala Saheb continued to print the list with fresh new South Indian names but changed the caption
 ab capshan tha padho auki badho (vaachaa ani uthaa) iske baad maarmik ke daftar kebaahar berozegaar yuvaonki bheed lagane lag gai
 That telephone directory of Balasaheb was shaking the hearts and minds of Marathi youth
 roj maarmik ke saamne marathi yuvaaon kii bheed jutati
 Thackeray's father Prabodhan Thackeray also felt that this energy, this energy charge should not be wasted
 pehali raily main hi bhar gaya tha shivaji park19 june 1966 main subah saadhe nau baje ek nariyal phodkar sirf 18 logon kii maujuudagi main shivasena bani
 Prabodhan Thackeray named the party Shiv Sena
 party ke gathan ke 4 maheene baad thakare ne maarmik ke jariye shivasena kii pehali raily dashahara par shivaji park main karne kaa elaan kiya
 a few days later someone told them that it was not right to hold the first rally in a big place like Shivaji Park
 unhen koi chota maidan rakhana chahie jahaan log kam bhi aaenge to maidan bharaa lagegaa
 But in the first rally of Shiv Sena held in 1966, so many people gathered that Shivaji Maidan became small
 shivasena kii pehali raily main jamaa hue logon main jarbadast utsaah tha
 Marathi youths who were overwhelmed with enthusiasm after Bala Saheb's speech would actually say that they were enraged that Shivaji broke out of South Indian shops in Matunga after leaving the park
 tod-phod kaa ye silsilaa balasaheb kii reliyon ke baad kaaphi lambey samay tak chalata rahaa
 Chinese President Xi Chinfing said that the People's Liberation Army (PLA) should prepare to win the 'regional war' and ensure that all decisions of the central leadership were strictly followed
 central military kamishan (siemasi) ke adhyaksh or communist party of china ke mahasachiv shi ne kaha, piele bal mukhyalay kaa communist party of china ke prati purna nishtha or usamen sudrudh vishwaas hona chahie
 It should be ensured that all decisions of the central leadership are fully implemented
 sarkari samvaad samiti shinhua ne pichley saptaah bharat kii teen divasiy yatra se laute shi ke hawaale se kaha, pipuls libration army bal mukhyalay ko apni yudhak taiyaari main sudhaar karnaa chahie or soochna evam praudyogiki ke daur main kshetreey yuddh jeetne kii apni kshamta main dakshata badhaani chahie
 This is not the first time that Xi has made such a statement about winning a 'regional war', but his statement is significant in view of the frequent incursions by China into Indian territory along the Line of Actual Control
 aadhikarik bayaan ke anusaar, sabhi piele balon ko raashtrapati shi ke nirdeshon kaa paalan karnaa chahie or siemasi dwaara tay kiye gaye nae lakshyon or mishan ko praapt karne hetu apane abhiyaanon main sudhaar karnaa chahie
 However, it has not been clear yet why so much emphasis is being placed on absolute loyalty and compliance of orders for smooth implementation of the command
 china ke raashtrapati shi chinafing kii ore se ye nirdesh aise vakt main aae hai jab ladakh kshetra ke chumaar ilaake main vaastavik niyantran rekha par piele or bhartiya sena ke bich gatirodh chal rahaa he
 The deadlock took a new turn on Monday when the PLA erected seven tents within the Indian border and there is no sign of moving away
 satta sanbhaalane ke pehle hi din se raashtrapati pad, sipisi or sena teenon kaa hi adhikaar milane ke kaaran 61 varshiya shi ne purv raashtrapati deng shaoping ke baad china ke sabase shaktishaalee netaa kii chhavi akhriyaar kar lee he
 Deng became the country's president after Mao
 shi ke purvavarti hu jintaao ko teenon adhikaar ek saath praapt nahin hue the
 Since assuming power, Xi has changed army positions, appointed generals loyal to him to the top positions, and removed some of the PLA generals and prosecuted them on corruption charges
 piele pramukh general phang phengui ne ek bayaan main kaha tha ki piele ke sabhi bal siemasi ke adhyaksh raashtrapati shi ke nirdeshon kaa paalan karte hai
 The CMC is the high command of China's military
 phang ne kaha tha ki balon ko siemasi dwaara tay kiye gaye nae lakshyon or mishan ko paane ke liye apane abhiyaanon main sudhaar karnaa chahie
 Meanwhile, the 'PLA Chiefs of Staff' met in Beijing to discuss ways to increase the efficiency of the army under new circumstances
 phang bhi is baithak main shaamil hue
