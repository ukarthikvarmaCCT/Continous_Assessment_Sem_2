 sahi samay par agar koi kaary puraa nahin kiya gaya, to phir icchit parinaam kabhi nahin milte hai
 And so for 'team India', for Team India of 1
25 billion countrymen, today we have to pledge to make 'new India' by 2022 and we will do this work ourselves, no one will do it, we will do it ourselves
 desh ke liye karenge, pehle se acha karenge, pehle se zyada karenge, samarpan bhav se karenge, 2022 main ‘bhavy-divya’ hindustan dekhne ke liye karenge
 And that's why we will all together create an India where the poor have a pucca house, electricity, water
 ham sab milakar ek aisa bharat banaaenge, jahaan desh kaa kisaan chintaa main nahin chaiyn se soyega
 By 2022, he will earn twice as much as he is earning today
 ham sab milakar ke ek aisa hindustan banaaenge, jahaan yuvaaon, mahilaon ko apane sapane puure karne ke liye bharpoor avasar uplabdh honge
 Together we will create an India that will be free from terrorism, communalism and casteism
 ham sab milakar ke ek aisa bharat banaaenge, jahaan bhrashtachar or bhai-bhatijawad se koi samjhauta nahin hoga
 Together we will create an India that will be clean, healthy and fulfill the dream of Swaraj
 or isaliye mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, ham sab milakar ke vikaas kii is daud main aage chalane kaa prayaas karenge
 Today, after 70 years of independence, in the midst of waiting for 75 years of independence, in the important tenure of five years, all of us countrymen should go with the dream of a 'divine-grand India', with this same sentiment i once again i bow to the crazy people
 sava sau karod deshavaasiyon ke nae vishwaas, nai umang ko naman karata hum
 And call upon 'team India' to move forward with a new resolution
 isi bhaavana ke saath aap sabko hriday se meri bahut bahut shubhakamanaayen

 The comments sabhi kaa bahut bahut dhanyavad
 Sincerely: PIB bhaaiyo-bahanon, anginat nirnay hamane teen saal main liye
 Some things have been noted and some things may not have come into notice
 lekin ek baat mahatvapurn he
 When you make such a big change, the stops come, the speed stops
 lekin is sarkaar kii kaaryastylee dekhie, agar train bhi kisi railway stesan ke paas se guzarati he, jab trek badalati he to 60 se chalane vaali speed ko usko 30 kii speed main laana padataa he
 The speed of the train decreases by changing the track
 ham puure desh ko ek nae trek par le jane kaa prayaas kar rahe hai, lekin hamane uski speed kam nahin hone di he, hamane uski gati ko barkaraar rakhaa he
 Whether we bring GST, any law, any new system, we have succeeded in doing that and we will do it in future
 hamane infrastructure par bal diya he
 Unprecedented expenses are being given on infrastructure
 railway stesan kaa aadhunikeekaran ho, chote shahar main, chaahe airport bananaa ho, chaahe water-way kii vyavastha kerani ho, chaahe roadways kii vyavastha kerani ho, chaahe gas grid banani ho, chaahe pani kii grid karaani ho, chaahe optical fibre network karnaa ho, har prakaar ke aadhunik infrastructure par ham purna bal de rahe hai
 My dear countrymen, our eastern India is the most energetic field to advance India in the 21st century
 itnaa potential he, samarthyavan maanav sansaadhan he, apaar prakritik sampada he, parishram ke dhani hai, sankalp karke jindagi badalane kaa samarthy rakhte hai
 Our entire focus is on eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Bengal, Assam, North East, Odisha, these are our powerful states, where natural wealth is abundant, we are trying to take the country to a new height by taking it forward
 bhaaiyo-bahanon, bhrashtachar mukt bharat ek bada ahm kaam he, usko ham bal dene kaa prayaas kar rahe he
 After the formation of the government, the first task was to create SIT
 aaj teen saal ke baad main deshavaasiyon ko bataanaa chahta hum, garv se bataanaa chahta hum ki teen saal ke bheetar-bheetar, kareeb-kareeb sava lakh karod rupye se bhi zyada kalaadhan ko hamane khoj diya he, usko pakadaa he or usko suurender karne ke liye majaboor kiya he
 After that we decided to demonetise
 notebandi ke dwaara hamane anek mahatvapurn safaltaaen praapt kii hai
 The black money that was hidden had to come into the mainstream
 aapane dekha hoga ki ham kabhi 07 din-10 din-15 din badhaate jate the, kabhi petrol pump par, kabhi dawaai kii dukaan par, kabhi railway stesan par puraane note lene kaa silsilaa jari rakhte the, kyonki hamaara prayaas tha ki ek baar jo bhi dhan aae wo bainkon main formal economy kaa hissaa ban jaae or us kaam ko hamane safaltaapurvak paar kiya he
 And the reason for this is that the research that has been done now, is about three lakh crore rupees
 
 
 ye sarkaar ne research nahin kii he, baahar ke expert ne kii he
 Three lakh crore rupees after demonetisation, the additional, which never came back in the banking system, has come
 bainkon main jamaa kii gai raashi main paune do lakh karod se adhik raashi shaq ke ghere main he
 At least two lakh crore rupees of black money has had to reach the banks and now they are forced to give their answers with the system
 nae kaledhan par bhi bahut badi rukaawat aa gai he
 This year, see the result, 56 lakh new taxpayers filing income tax returns from 01 April to 05 August
 pichley saal usee avadhi main ye sankhya sirf 22 lakh thi
 More than double! These reasons are the result of our fight against black money
 18 lakh se zyada aise logon ko pahchaan liya gaya he, jinaki aay unke hisaab kitaab se kuch zyada he, beshumaar zyada he or isaliye is antar kaa unako jawaab dena pad rahaa he
 Out of this, four and a half lakh people have now come to the field, accepting their mistake and trying to get in the way
 ek lakh log aise saamne aae hai, jinhone kabhi jindagi main Income Tax kaa naam bhi nahin suna tha, na Income Tax kabhi diya tha, na kabhi unhone us par sochaa tha, lekin aaj unako wo karnaa pad rahaa he
 Brothers and sisters, if two or four companies are shut down in our country, then there are discussions on them round the clock
 arthniti khatm ho gai


 ye ho gaya, na jane kya kya hota he! aapako jaanakar ke hairaani hogi, kaale dhan ke kaarobaari, Shell companiyaan chalaate the or notebandi ke baad jab data-mining kiya gaya
 Then three lakh such companies have been found, which are just and shell companies only
 hawala kaa kaarobaar karti hai
 Three lakhs, one can imagine
 or usamen se paune do lakh kaa registration hamanen Cancel kar diya he
 If five companies are closed, then there is a storm in India
 paune do lakh companiyon ko taale laga diye
 Those who looted the goods of the country will have to answer, we did this by doing this
 aapako hairaani hogi! kuch to shell companiyaan aisi hai, jo ek hi Address par chaar sau chaar sau companiyaan chal rahi thim, bhaaiyon bahanon
 Four hundred and four hundred companies were operating
 koi dekhne vaala nahin tha, koi poochne vaala nahin tha
 All the collusion was going on
 or isaliye mere bhaaiyon bahanon, maine bhrashtachar kaale dhan ke khilaaf ek bahut badi ladaai chhedi he
 For the betterment of the country, for the welfare of the poor of the country, for the future of the youth of the country
 bhaaiyon bahanon, ek ke baad ek kadam or mujhe vishwaas he GST ke baad usamen or badhotaree hone vaali he
 And Transparency is forthcoming
 akele Transportation hamaara trek vaala ek sthaan se duusare sthaan par jaataa tha
 After this GST, thirty percent of his time is saved
 check-post khatm hone ke kaaran hajaaron karod rupayon kii to bachat hui he
 The biggest savings have been time
 ek prakaar se uski tees pratishat Efficiency bad rahi he
 You can imagine what it means to increase thirty percent efficiency in the transport world of India
 ek GST ke kaaran itnaa bada parivartan aayaa he
 My dear countrymen, today money has come to banks due to demonetisation
 bank apni byaaj dar kam kar rahe hai
 The common man is getting money from the bank through currency
 saamaanya maanav ko apane pairon par khadey hone ke liye avasar mil rahaa he
 Be poor, a middle class person wants to build a house, then banks are coming forward to help him, coming at a lower rate of interest
 ye sara desh ke arthtantr ko gati dene kii disha main kaam kar rahaa he
 My dear countrymen, now is the time
 ham 21veen sadi main hai
 The largest youth group in the world is in our country
 duniya main hamaari pahchaan IT ke dwaara he, Digital World ke dwaara he
 Will we still remain in the same old thinking? are! ek jamaane main chamade ke sikke chalate the, dhire-dhire lupt ho gaye, koi poochne vaala nahin rahaa
 Today the paper notes are going to be converted into digital currency all the time
 ham netritv karen, ham jimmevary len, ham Digital Transaction kii ore jaaen
 We adopt BHIM APP, become part of economic business
 ham Prepaid ke dwaara bhi kaam karen
 And i am happy that Digital transactions have grown
 pichley saal ke mukaable usamen 34 pratishat kaa ijapha hua he or Prepaid bhugtan main kareeb 44 pratishat kaa
 And that's why we should go ahead with a low cash economy
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, sarkaar kii kuch yojanaayen aisi hai, jo hindustan ke saamaanya maanav kii jeb main paise bachaa saken
 If you put an LED bulb, then a thousand rupees two thousand five thousand rupees of the year are going to save you
 agar aap svachh bharat main safal hote hai, to garib kaa saat hajaar kaa rupaya dawaai kaa band hota he
 Controlling inflation has been successful in curbing your rising expenses, in a way your savings
 ‘jan aushadhi kendron’ ke dwaara sasti dawaai kii dukaan garib ke liye ek bahut bada aashirwad bani he
 The expenses that were behind our operation, behind the stent, have come down
 aane vaale dinon main Knee ke Operation ke liye bhi sari suvidhaayen milengi
 Our effort is to reduce these expenses for the poor and middle class human beings and for that we are taking steps one after the other
 pehle hamaare desh main rajyon ke mukhyalay main Dialysis hua karata tha
 We decided to deliver dialysis to the district centers of India
 kareeb saadhe teen sau, chaar sau jilon tak pahunchaa diya or muft main Dialysis karke garib kii jindagi bachaane kaa kaam ham kar rahe hai
 Today the country can be proud that we have developed our systems in front of the world
 GPS System ke dwaara NAVIC Navigation kii vyavastha aaj karne main ham safal hue hai
 Through SAARC Satellite, we have successfully campaigned to help with neighboring countries
 ham ‘tejas’ hawaii jahaaj ke dwaara aaj duniya ke andar apni ahmiyat pahunchaa rahe hai
 The 'BHIM-AADHAR App' is a wonder within the world for Digital Transaction
 rupay Card 
 
 
 In India, rupay Card is worth crores
 or agar wo operational ho jayega, wo agar garibon ke jeb main he, to duniya kaa, ye sabase bada ho jayega
 And that's why my dear countrymen, i request you to move ahead by taking a pledge for 'new India', and do it in time
 hamaare yahaan shastron main kaha gaya haih aniyat kaal:, aniyat kaalah prabhutayo viplavante, prabhutayo viplavante
 If a task is not completed at the right time, then the desired result is never achieved
 or isaliye ‘team India’ ke liye, sava sau karod deshavaasiyon kii team India ke liye, aaj hamen sankalp lenaa hoga 2022 tak ‘new India’ banane kaa or ye kaam ham khud karenge, koi karegaa aisa nahin, ham khud karenge
 Will do for the country, will do better than before, will do more than before, will do it with dedication, in 2022 to see 'grand-divine' Hindustan
 or isaliye ham sab milakar ke ek aisa bharat banaaenge jahaan garib ke paas pakkaa ghar ho, bijli ho, pani ho
 Together we will create an India where the farmer of the country will sleep peacefully
 aaj wo jitna kama rahaa he, usase 2022 tak doguna kamayega
 Together we will create an India where youth and women will have ample opportunities to fulfill their dreams
 ham sab milakar ke ek aisa bharat banaaenge, jo aatankwaad sampradayawad or jatvaad se mukt hoga
 Together we will create an India where there will be no compromise on corruption and nepotism
 ham sab milakar ke ek aisa bharat banaaenge, jo svachh hoga, swasth hoga or swaraj ke sapane ko puraa karegaa
 And therefore my dear countrymen, we will all try to work together in this race of development
 aaj aazaadee ke 70 saal ke baad, aazaadee ke 75 saal kii pratiksha ke bich paanch saal ke mahatvapurn kaarykaal main ek ‘divya-bhavy bharat’ ke sapane ko lekar ke ham sabhi deshvasi chalem, isi ek bhav ke saath main phir ek baar aazaadee ke diwaanon ko pranaam karata hum
 i salute the new faith, new zeal of 1
25 billion countrymen
 or nae sankalp ke saath aage chalane ke liye ‘team India’ ko aahvaan karata hum
 With this feeling, my heartiest greetings to all of you

 saabhaar: PIB We have laid emphasis on infrastructure
 abhootpurv kharch infrastructure par die ja rahe hai
 The railway station should be modernized, in a small town, whether to build an airport, whether to arrange water-way, whether to arrange roadways, whether to build a gas grid, whether to do a water grid, whether to do optical fiber network , We are giving full emphasis on all types of modern infrastructure
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, 21veen sadi main bharat ko aage badhaane kaa sabase urjavan kshetra he, hamaara purvi hindustan
 There is so much potential, powerful human resource, immense natural wealth, rich of hard work, and ability to change life by resolving
 hamaara puraa dhyaan purvi uttar pradesh, bihar, bengal, assam, north east, odisha, ye hamaare aise samarthyavan rajya hai, jahaan prakritik sampada bharpoor he, usko aage badhaakar ke desh ko ek nai oonchai par le jane kii disha main ham prayatnrat he
 Brothers and sisters, corruption-free India is a very important task, we are trying to strengthen it
 sarkaar banane ke baad pehla kaam kiya tha SIT banane kaa
 Today, after three years, i want to tell the countrymen, proudly tell them that within three years, we have discovered more than about 1
25 lakh crore rupees of black money, caught it and suurender it
 Is forced
 uske baad hamane notebandi kaa faisla kiya
 We have achieved many significant successes through demonetisation
 jo kalaadhan chipa hua tha, usko mukhyadhara main aana padaa
 You must have seen that we sometimes used to extend 07 days-10 days-15 days, sometimes at the petrol pump, sometimes at the drugstore, sometimes at the railway station, we continued to take old notes, because our effort was once Money should also become a part of the formal economy in the banks and we have successfully completed that work
 or iskaa kaaran yah hua he ki abhi jo research hua he, kareeb teen lakh karod rupye
 
 
 This government has not done research, outside experts have done it
 notebandi ke baad teen lakh karod rupye, jo atirikt, jo kabhi banking system main waapas nahin aata tha wo aayaa he
 More than a quarter of a million rupees in the amount deposited in banks is under suspicion
 kam se kam do lakh karod rupye se zyada kalaadhan usko bainko tak pahunchnaa padaa he or ab vyavastha ke saath unako apana jawaab dene ke liye majaboor hue hai
 The new black money has also come to a great halt
 is varsh, iskaa parinaam dekhie, 01 april se 05 agast tak income tax return daakhil karne vaale nae vyaktigat karadaataaon kii sankhya 56 lakh
 In the same period last year, this number was only 2
2 million
 Double se bhi zyada! ye kaaran kaledhan ke khilaaf hamaari ladaai kaa parinaam he
 More than 18 lakh people have been identified, whose income is more than the book according to them, they are uncountable and hence they have to answer this difference
 saadhe chaar lakh log isamen se ab maidan main aaye hai, apni galati sweekaar karke raste main aane kaa prayaas kar rahe hai
 One lakh people have come forward, who had never heard of income tax in life, nor had ever given income tax, nor had they thought of it, but today they have to do it
 bhaaiyon bahanon, hamaare desh main agar do chaar companiyaan bhi kahin band ho jaae, to choubison ghante us par charchaaen hoti hai us par Debates hoti hai
 Economy is over


 it is done, no matter what happens! You'd be surprised to know, black money traders, Shell used to run companies and after demonetisation when data-mining was done
 tab teen lakh aisi companiyaan pai gayi hai, jo sirf or sirf shell companiyaan hai
 Does hawala business
 teen lakh, koi kalpana kar saktaa he
 And we have canceled the registration of one and a half lakh from that
 paanch companiyaan band ho jaae to hindustan main tufaan much jaataa he
 Locked up to twenty two lakh companies
 desh kaa maal luutane waalon ko jawaab dena padegaa, ye kaam hamane kar ke dikhaaya
 You will be surprised! Some shell companies are such that four hundred and four hundred companies were running at the same address, brothers and sisters
 chaar sau chaar sau companiyaan chal rahi thim
 Nobody was going to see, nobody was going to ask
 sari mileebhagat chal rahi thi
 And so my brothers and sisters, i have waged a very big fight against corruption black money
 desh kii bhalaai ke liye desh ke garibon ke kalyaan ke liye, desh ke naujavaanon ke bhavishya ko banane ke liye
 Brothers and sisters, one step after the other, and i am sure it will increase further after GST
 or Transparency aane vaali he
 Transportation alone Our truck used to go from one place to another
 ye GST ke baad tees pratishat uskaa samay batch gaya he
 Thousands of crores of rupees have been saved due to the end of check-post
 sabase badi bachat samay kii hui he
 In a way, its thirty percent efficiency is increasing
 aap kalpana kar sakate hai hindustan ke Transport jagat main tees pratishat Efficiency badhane kaa matlab kya hota he
 a GST has brought about such a big change
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, aaj notebandi ke kaaran bainko ke paas dhan aayaa he
 Banks are reducing their interest rate
 mudra ke dwaara saamaanya maanav ko bank se paisa mil rahaa he
 The common man is getting an opportunity to stand on his feet
 garib ho, madhyavarg kaa vyakti ho ghar bananaa chahta he, to bank usko madad karne ke liye aage aa rahe hai, kam byaaj kii dar se aage aa rahe hai
 It is working towards accelerating the economy of the country
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, ab ye vakt badal chukaa he
 We are in the 21st century
 vishwa kaa sabase bada yuva varg hamaare desh main he
 Our identity in the world is by IT, by Digital World
 kya ab bhi ham usee pooraani soch main rahenge
 Hey! Once upon a time, leather coins used to move, slowly disappeared, no one was asking
 aaj jo kaagaj ke note hai, samay aate rahete wo sara kaa sara Digital Currency main Convert hone vaala he
 Let us lead, let us take responsibility, let us go towards Digital Transaction
 ham BHIM APP ko apanaaen, aarthik kaarobaar kaa hissaa banaaen
 We also work through Prepaid
 or mujhe khushi he ki Digital lenden badi he
 It has increased by 34 percent over the previous year and about 44 percent in prepaid payments
 or isaliye kam cash vaali arthvyavastha, usko lekar ke hamen aage badhanaa chahie
 My dear countrymen, there are some schemes of the government that can save money in the pockets of the common man of India
 agar aap LED Bulb lagaate hai, to saal bhar kaa hajaar do hajaar paanch hajaar rupaya aapkaa bachane vaala he
 If you succeed in a clean India, then the poor's medicine of seven thousand rupees stops
 mahangaai par niyantran, aapke badhate hue kharch ko rokane main safal hua he, ek prakaar se aapaki bachat he
 Affordable medicine shops have become a huge blessing for the poor through 'jan Aushadhi Kendras'
 hamaare yahaan Operation ke peeche, stent ke peeche jo kharch hote the wo kam hue hai
 In the coming days, all facilities will also be available for Knee's operation
 hamaari koshish he ki garib or madhyamvarg ke maanav ke liye ye kharch kam ho or uske liye ham ek ke baad ek kadam uthaa rahe hai
 Earlier, dialysis used to take place in the headquarters of the states in our country
 hamane tay kiya hindustan ke jila kendron tak Dialysis pahunchaayenge
 Nearly three and a half hundred and four hundred districts have been reached and by dialysis for free, we are working to save the life of the poor
 aaj desh garv kar saktaa he ki hamane vishwa ke saamne apni vyavasthaaon ko viksit kiya he
 Today we have succeeded in arranging NAVIC Navigation through GPS System
 hamane SAARC Satellite ke dwaara hamane padosi deshon ke saath madad karne kaa safal abhiyaan kiya he
 We are delivering our importance inside the world today by 'tejas' airplane
 ‘BHIM-AADHAR App’ duniya ke andar Digital Transaction ke liye ek ajooba bana hua he
 rupay Card
 
 
 hindustan main rupay Card karodon kii taadaad main he
 And if it becomes operational, if it is in the pocket of the poor, then it will become the largest in the world
 or isaliye mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, meraa aapse yahi aagrah he ki ham ‘new India’ kaa sankalp le kar ke aage badhen, samay rahete hue karen
 It is said in our scriptures: Aniyat Kaal: Aniyat Kaal: Prabhutyo Viplavante, Prabhutyo Viplavante

 Our identity in the world is by IT, by Digital World

 Hey! Once upon a time, leather coins used to move, slowly disappeared, no one was asking
 aaj jo kaagaj ke note hai, samay aate rahete wo sara kaa sara Digital Currency main Convert hone vaala he
 Let us lead, let us take responsibility, let us go towards Digital Transaction
 ham BHIM APP ko apanaaen, aarthik kaarobaar kaa hissaa banaaen
 We also work through Prepaid
 or mujhe khushi he ki Digital lenden badi he
 It has increased by 34 percent over the previous year and about 44 percent in prepaid payments
 or isaliye kam cash vaali arthvyavastha, usko lekar ke hamen aage badhanaa chahie
 My dear countrymen, there are some schemes of the government that can save money in the pockets of the common man of India
 agar aap LED Bulb lagaate hai, to saal bhar kaa hajaar do hajaar paanch hajaar rupaya aapkaa bachane vaala he
 If you succeed in a clean India, then the poor's medicine of seven thousand rupees stops
 mahangaai par niyantran, aapke badhate hue kharch ko rokane main safal hua he, ek prakaar se aapaki bachat he
 Affordable medicine shops have become a huge blessing for the poor through 'jan Aushadhi Kendras'
 hamaare yahaan Operation ke peeche, stent ke peeche jo kharch hote the wo kam hue hai
 In the coming days, all facilities will also be available for Knee's operation
 hamaari koshish he ki garib or madhyamvarg ke maanav ke liye ye kharch kam ho or uske liye ham ek ke baad ek kadam uthaa rahe hai
 Earlier, dialysis used to take place in the headquarters of the states in our country
 hamane tay kiya hindustan ke jila kendron tak Dialysis pahunchaayenge
 Nearly three and a half hundred and four hundred districts have been reached and by dialysis for free, we are working to save the life of the poor
 aaj desh garv kar saktaa he ki hamane vishwa ke saamne apni vyavasthaaon ko viksit kiya he
 Today we have succeeded in arranging NAVIC Navigation through GPS System
 hamane SAARC Satellite ke dwaara hamane padosi deshon ke saath madad karne kaa safal abhiyaan kiya he
 We are delivering our importance inside the world today by 'tejas' airplane
 ‘BHIM-AADHAR App’ duniya ke andar Digital Transaction ke liye ek ajooba bana hua he
 rupay Card
 
 
 hindustan main rupay Card karodon kii taadaad main he
 And if it becomes operational, if it is in the pocket of the poor, then it will become the largest in the world
 or isaliye mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, meraa aapse yahi aagrah he ki ham ‘new India’ kaa sankalp le kar ke aage badhen, samay rahete hue karen
 It is said in our scriptures: Aniyat Kaal: Aniyat Kaal: Prabhutyo Viplavante, Prabhutyo Viplavante
 sahi samay par agar koi kaary puraa nahin kiya gaya, to phir icchit parinaam kabhi nahin milte hai
 And so for 'team India', for Team India of 1
25 billion countrymen, today we have to pledge to make 'new India' by 2022 and we will do this work ourselves, no one will do it, we will do it ourselves
 desh ke liye karenge, pehle se acha karenge, pehle se zyada karenge, samarpan bhav se karenge, 2022 main ‘bhavy-divya’ hindustan dekhne ke liye karenge
 And that's why we will all together create an India where the poor have a pucca house, electricity, water
 ham sab milakar ek aisa bharat banaaenge, jahaan desh kaa kisaan chintaa main nahin chaiyn se soyega
 By 2022, he will earn twice as much as he is earning today
 ham sab milakar ke ek aisa hindustan banaaenge, jahaan yuvaaon, mahilaon ko apane sapane puure karne ke liye bharpoor avasar uplabdh honge
 Together we will create an India that will be free from terrorism, communalism and casteism
 ham sab milakar ke ek aisa bharat banaaenge, jahaan bhrashtachar or bhai-bhatijawad se koi samjhauta nahin hoga
 Together we will create an India that will be clean, healthy and fulfill the dream of Swaraj
 or isaliye mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, ham sab milakar ke vikaas kii is daud main aage chalane kaa prayaas karenge
 Today, after 70 years of independence, in the midst of waiting for 75 years of independence, in the important tenure of five years, all of us countrymen should go with the dream of a 'divine-grand India', with this same sentiment i once again i bow to the crazy people
 sava sau karod deshavaasiyon ke nae vishwaas, nai umang ko naman karata hum
 And call upon 'team India' to move forward with a new resolution
 isi bhaavana ke saath aap sabko hriday se meri bahut bahut shubhakamanaayen

 The comments sabhi kaa bahut bahut dhanyavad
 Sincerely: PIB bhaaiyo-bahanon, bhrashtachar mukt bharat ek bada ahm kaam he, usko ham bal dene kaa prayaas kar rahe he
 After the formation of the government, the first task was to create SIT
 aaj teen saal ke baad main deshavaasiyon ko bataanaa chahta hum, garv se bataanaa chahta hum ki teen saal ke bheetar-bheetar, kareeb-kareeb sava lakh karod rupye se bhi zyada kalaadhan ko hamane khoj diya he, usko pakadaa he or usko suurender karne ke liye majaboor kiya he
 After that we decided to demonetise
 notebandi ke dwaara hamane anek mahatvapurn safaltaaen praapt kii hai
 The black money that was hidden had to come into the mainstream
 aapane dekha hoga ki ham kabhi 07 din-10 din-15 din badhaate jate the, kabhi petrol pump par, kabhi dawaai kii dukaan par, kabhi railway stesan par puraane note lene kaa silsilaa jari rakhte the, kyonki hamaara prayaas tha ki ek baar jo bhi dhan aae wo bainkon main formal economy kaa hissaa ban jaae or us kaam ko hamane safaltaapurvak paar kiya he
 And the reason for this is that the research that has been done now, is about three lakh crore rupees
 
 
 ye sarkaar ne research nahin kii he, baahar ke expert ne kii he
 Three lakh crore rupees after demonetisation, the additional, which never came back in the banking system, has come
 bainkon main jamaa kii gai raashi main paune do lakh karod se adhik raashi shaq ke ghere main he
 At least two lakh crore rupees of black money has had to reach the banks and now they are forced to give their answers with the system
 nae kaledhan par bhi bahut badi rukaawat aa gai he
 This year, see the result, 56 lakh new taxpayers filing income tax returns from 01 April to 05 August
 pichley saal usee avadhi main ye sankhya sirf 22 lakh thi
 More than double! These reasons are the result of our fight against black money
 18 lakh se zyada aise logon ko pahchaan liya gaya he, jinaki aay unke hisaab kitaab se kuch zyada he, beshumaar zyada he or isaliye is antar kaa unako jawaab dena pad rahaa he
 Out of this, four and a half lakh people have now come to the field, accepting their mistake and trying to get in the way
 ek lakh log aise saamne aae hai, jinhone kabhi jindagi main Income Tax kaa naam bhi nahin suna tha, na Income Tax kabhi diya tha, na kabhi unhone us par sochaa tha, lekin aaj unako wo karnaa pad rahaa he
 Brothers and sisters, if two or four companies are shut down in our country, then there are discussions on them round the clock
 arthniti khatm ho gai


 ye ho gaya, na jane kya kya hota he! aapako jaanakar ke hairaani hogi, kaale dhan ke kaarobaari, Shell companiyaan chalaate the or notebandi ke baad jab data-mining kiya gaya
 Then three lakh such companies have been found, which are just and shell companies only
 hawala kaa kaarobaar karti hai
 Three lakhs, one can imagine
 or usamen se paune do lakh kaa registration hamanen Cancel kar diya he
 If five companies are closed, then there is a storm in India
 paune do lakh companiyon ko taale laga diye
 Those who looted the goods of the country will have to answer, we did this by doing this
 aapako hairaani hogi! kuch to shell companiyaan aisi hai, jo ek hi Address par chaar sau chaar sau companiyaan chal rahi thim, bhaaiyon bahanon
 Four hundred and four hundred companies were operating
 koi dekhne vaala nahin tha, koi poochne vaala nahin tha
 All the collusion was going on
 or isaliye mere bhaaiyon bahanon, maine bhrashtachar kaale dhan ke khilaaf ek bahut badi ladaai chhedi he
 For the betterment of the country, for the welfare of the poor of the country, for the future of the youth of the country
 bhaaiyon bahanon, ek ke baad ek kadam or mujhe vishwaas he GST ke baad usamen or badhotaree hone vaali he
 And Transparency is forthcoming
 akele Transportation hamaara trek vaala ek sthaan se duusare sthaan par jaataa tha
 After this GST, thirty percent of his time is saved
 check-post khatm hone ke kaaran hajaaron karod rupayon kii to bachat hui he
 The biggest savings have been time
 ek prakaar se uski tees pratishat Efficiency bad rahi he
 You can imagine what it means to increase thirty percent efficiency in the transport world of India
 ek GST ke kaaran itnaa bada parivartan aayaa he
 My dear countrymen, today money has come to banks due to demonetisation
 bank apni byaaj dar kam kar rahe hai
 The common man is getting money from the bank through currency
 saamaanya maanav ko apane pairon par khadey hone ke liye avasar mil rahaa he
 Be poor, a middle class person wants to build a house, then banks are coming forward to help him, coming at a lower rate of interest
 ye sara desh ke arthtantr ko gati dene kii disha main kaam kar rahaa he
 My dear countrymen, now is the time
 ham 21veen sadi main hai
 The largest youth group in the world is in our country
 duniya main hamaari pahchaan IT ke dwaara he, Digital World ke dwaara he
 Will we still remain in the same old thinking? are! ek jamaane main chamade ke sikke chalate the, dhire-dhire lupt ho gaye, koi poochne vaala nahin rahaa
 Today the paper notes are going to be converted into digital currency all the time
 ham netritv karen, ham jimmevary len, ham Digital Transaction kii ore jaaen
 We adopt BHIM APP, become part of economic business
 ham Prepaid ke dwaara bhi kaam karen
 And i am happy that Digital transactions have grown
 pichley saal ke mukaable usamen 34 pratishat kaa ijapha hua he or Prepaid bhugtan main kareeb 44 pratishat kaa
 And that's why we should go ahead with a low cash economy
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, sarkaar kii kuch yojanaayen aisi hai, jo hindustan ke saamaanya maanav kii jeb main paise bachaa saken
 If you put an LED bulb, then a thousand rupees two thousand five thousand rupees of the year are going to save you
 agar aap svachh bharat main safal hote hai, to garib kaa saat hajaar kaa rupaya dawaai kaa band hota he
 Controlling inflation has been successful in curbing your rising expenses, in a way your savings
 ‘jan aushadhi kendron’ ke dwaara sasti dawaai kii dukaan garib ke liye ek bahut bada aashirwad bani he
 The expenses that were behind our operation, behind the stent, have come down
 aane vaale dinon main Knee ke Operation ke liye bhi sari suvidhaayen milengi
 Our effort is to reduce these expenses for the poor and middle class human beings and for that we are taking steps one after the other
 pehle hamaare desh main rajyon ke mukhyalay main Dialysis hua karata tha
 We decided to deliver dialysis to the district centers of India
 kareeb saadhe teen sau, chaar sau jilon tak pahunchaa diya or muft main Dialysis karke garib kii jindagi bachaane kaa kaam ham kar rahe hai
 Today the country can be proud that we have developed our systems in front of the world
 GPS System ke dwaara NAVIC Navigation kii vyavastha aaj karne main ham safal hue hai
 Through SAARC Satellite, we have successfully campaigned to help with neighboring countries
 ham ‘tejas’ hawaii jahaaj ke dwaara aaj duniya ke andar apni ahmiyat pahunchaa rahe hai
 The 'BHIM-AADHAR App' is a wonder within the world for Digital Transaction
 rupay Card 
 
 
 In India, rupay Card is worth crores
 or agar wo operational ho jayega, wo agar garibon ke jeb main he, to duniya kaa, ye sabase bada ho jayega
 And that's why my dear countrymen, i request you to move ahead by taking a pledge for 'new India', and do it in time
 hamaare yahaan shastron main kaha gaya haih aniyat kaal:, aniyat kaalah prabhutayo viplavante, prabhutayo viplavante
 If a task is not completed at the right time, then the desired result is never achieved
 or isaliye ‘team India’ ke liye, sava sau karod deshavaasiyon kii team India ke liye, aaj hamen sankalp lenaa hoga 2022 tak ‘new India’ banane kaa or ye kaam ham khud karenge, koi karegaa aisa nahin, ham khud karenge
 Will do for the country, will do better than before, will do more than before, will do it with dedication, in 2022 to see 'grand-divine' Hindustan
 or isaliye ham sab milakar ke ek aisa bharat banaaenge jahaan garib ke paas pakkaa ghar ho, bijli ho, pani ho
 Together we will create an India where the farmer of the country will sleep peacefully
 aaj wo jitna kama rahaa he, usase 2022 tak doguna kamayega
 Together we will create an India where youth and women will have ample opportunities to fulfill their dreams
 ham sab milakar ke ek aisa bharat banaaenge, jo aatankwaad sampradayawad or jatvaad se mukt hoga
 Together we will create an India where there will be no compromise on corruption and nepotism
 ham sab milakar ke ek aisa bharat banaaenge, jo svachh hoga, swasth hoga or swaraj ke sapane ko puraa karegaa
 And therefore my dear countrymen, we will all try to work together in this race of development
 aaj aazaadee ke 70 saal ke baad, aazaadee ke 75 saal kii pratiksha ke bich paanch saal ke mahatvapurn kaarykaal main ek ‘divya-bhavy bharat’ ke sapane ko lekar ke ham sabhi deshvasi chalem, isi ek bhav ke saath main phir ek baar aazaadee ke diwaanon ko pranaam karata hum

 kam se kam do lakh karod rupye se zyada kalaadhan usko bainko tak pahunchnaa padaa he or ab vyavastha ke saath unako apana jawaab dene ke liye majaboor hue hai
 The new black money has also come to a great halt
 is varsh, iskaa parinaam dekhie, 01 april se 05 agast tak income tax return daakhil karne vaale nae vyaktigat karadaataaon kii sankhya 56 lakh
 In the same period last year, this number was only 2
2 million
 Double se bhi zyada! ye kaaran kaledhan ke khilaaf hamaari ladaai kaa parinaam he
 More than 18 lakh people have been identified, whose income is more than the book according to them, they are uncountable and hence they have to answer this difference
 saadhe chaar lakh log isamen se ab maidan main aaye hai, apni galati sweekaar karke raste main aane kaa prayaas kar rahe hai
 One lakh people have come forward, who had never heard of income tax in life, nor had ever given income tax, nor had they thought of it, but today they have to do it
 bhaaiyon bahanon, hamaare desh main agar do chaar companiyaan bhi kahin band ho jaae, to choubison ghante us par charchaaen hoti hai us par Debates hoti hai
 Economy is over


 it is done, no matter what happens! You'd be surprised to know, black money traders, Shell used to run companies and after demonetisation when data-mining was done
 tab teen lakh aisi companiyaan pai gayi hai, jo sirf or sirf shell companiyaan hai
 Does hawala business
 teen lakh, koi kalpana kar saktaa he
 And we have canceled the registration of one and a half lakh from that
 paanch companiyaan band ho jaae to hindustan main tufaan much jaataa he
 Locked up to twenty two lakh companies
 desh kaa maal luutane waalon ko jawaab dena padegaa, ye kaam hamane kar ke dikhaaya
 You will be surprised! Some shell companies are such that four hundred and four hundred companies were running at the same address, brothers and sisters
 chaar sau chaar sau companiyaan chal rahi thim
 Nobody was going to see, nobody was going to ask
 sari mileebhagat chal rahi thi
 And so my brothers and sisters, i have waged a very big fight against corruption black money
 desh kii bhalaai ke liye desh ke garibon ke kalyaan ke liye, desh ke naujavaanon ke bhavishya ko banane ke liye
 Brothers and sisters, one step after the other, and i am sure it will increase further after GST
 or Transparency aane vaali he
 Transportation alone Our truck used to go from one place to another
 ye GST ke baad tees pratishat uskaa samay batch gaya he
 Thousands of crores of rupees have been saved due to the end of check-post
 sabase badi bachat samay kii hui he
 In a way, its thirty percent efficiency is increasing
 aap kalpana kar sakate hai hindustan ke Transport jagat main tees pratishat Efficiency badhane kaa matlab kya hota he
 a GST has brought about such a big change
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, aaj notebandi ke kaaran bainko ke paas dhan aayaa he
 Banks are reducing their interest rate
 mudra ke dwaara saamaanya maanav ko bank se paisa mil rahaa he
 The common man is getting an opportunity to stand on his feet
 garib ho, madhyavarg kaa vyakti ho ghar bananaa chahta he, to bank usko madad karne ke liye aage aa rahe hai, kam byaaj kii dar se aage aa rahe hai
 It is working towards accelerating the economy of the country
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, ab ye vakt badal chukaa he
 We are in the 21st century
 vishwa kaa sabase bada yuva varg hamaare desh main he
 Our identity in the world is by IT, by Digital World

 Controlling inflation has been successful in curbing your rising expenses, in a way your savings

 The expenses that were behind our operation, behind the stent, have come down

 Our effort is to reduce these expenses for the poor and middle class human beings and for that we are taking steps one after the other

 Under a major revelation, Pakistan's claim was proved that only the Mujahideen were involved in the Kargil war

 Congress President Rahul Gandhi may be claiming to be Prime Minister with his own mouth, but his colleagues in Uttar Pradesh have made the Congress an orphan
 kairana or nurpur upachunaav main congress buree tarah se alag-thalag pad gai he
 The RLD, which stood with the Congress, also took a beating and left the Congress alone and not only grabbed the seat of Kairana but also found a place for itself in the SP-BSP alliance
 ab congress akele baahar khadey rahane ko majaboor ho gai or isaupachunaavamein alag-thalag padi congress party ne thak harkar ab kairana or nurpur main candidet na utaarne kaa elaan kar diya
 The Congress gave indirect support only by saying that it does not want to let the votes against the BJP increase
 congress kairana kii seat khud ladanaa chaahati thi kyonki yah congress kii paramparaagat seat bhi rah chuki he
 This is the political ground of Imran Masood, the big and controversial leader of Congress
 congress ke alag-thalag par padane kii baangi bhi bahut rochak he
 In the Kairana and Nurpur by-elections, the Congress kept lobbying for itself, but the SP and BSP did not pay any attention to it
 samaajawaadee party or bispi ke netaaon ne to is mudde par congress party se baat tak karne se manaa kar diya
 According to sources, the Samajwadi Party even wanted the Congress to try its position by contesting elections itself
 congress party kii daal jab gathbandhan main nahin gali tab usne areldi ke naam par apana daanv chalaa lekin yahaan areldi ne hi congress ko thenga dikhaa diya
 Ajit Singh and Congress were seen walking together but as soon as Ajit Singh got a place in the alliance, he did not take any time to distance himself from the Congress
 congress ko chhodkarasapa-basapa gathbandhanamen shaamil ho gaye
 Now frustrated from all sides, the Congress is currently suffering its wounds
 yah saaf ho gaya he ki teenon dalon ne apana gathbandhan kar liya he
 Has given seat to RLD and now joint candidate of three parties will contest against BJP, then Congress has no option but to give candidates
 buudhvaar shaam imran masood ne kairana or nurpur main congress kii taraf se pratyaashee naa dene kaa elaan kar diya
 He also said that the high command has not given the candidate just by saying that he does not want to let the opposition vote increase
 is puure gathbandhan main alag-thalag pad chuki congress ke liye 2019 main bhi koi khaas ummid nahin dikhaai de rahi kyonki bispi aurasamajwaadee partydonon ne congress ke saath gathbandhan karne kii koi ichha nahin jataai he
 Both parties want the Congress to contest elections in Uttar Pradesh on its own so that there can be a breach in bjp's vote
 vahiin mulaayam singh yadav ne bhi elaan kar rakhaa he ki congress kii haisiyat 2 seat se zyada kii nahin he
 In such a situation, the Congress, which is calling for a big coalition, has suffered the biggest blow in Uttar Pradesh itself
 agar kairana seat par nateeja gathbandhan ke paksh main aata he to congress ke liye 2019 main uttar pradesh main kisi gathbandhan main shaamil hona lagbhag naammumkin ho jayega

 For this, development works done by Modi in Gujarat will be shown

 Taking a lesson from the defeat in the Madhya Pradesh Assembly elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party has started to repair its fort just before the Lok Sabha elections
 pradesh main do dashak ke baad pehali baar adivasee vot bank bijepi ke haathon se phislaa he
 In such a situation, the BJP is facing a tough challenge on the Lok Sabha seats reserved for the Scheduled Tribes
 aise main pradhanmantri narendra modi soobe ke dhar main raily ke jariye adivaasiyon ko saadhane ke liye aaj utar rahe hai
 Tribal politics in MP The Scheduled Tribes (ST) class population is around 23%
 pradesh kii 29 loksabhaa siton main se chah siten anusuchit janajati ke liye arakshit hai, jinamein shadol, mandla, baitool, khargon, dhar or ratlam shaamil he
 The BJP won all six seats in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, but the Congress snatched the seat from the BJP in the by-election in Ratlam seat

 BJP has suffered heavy losses on seats reserved for Scheduled Tribes
 madhya pradesh ke malwa se lekar mahakaushal ilaake tak main bijepi ko bada nuksaan uthaanaa padaa tha
 In such a situation, if the same voting pattern is there, it will be difficult for the BJP to manage its fort in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 adivaasiyon ke liye arakshit seat ke samikarnmandla loksabhaa seat ke tahat 8 siten aati hai
 In the 2018 assembly elections, Congress got 6 seats and BJP got 2 seats
 jabaki 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ke faggan singh kulaste ne jeet hasil kii thi
 Similarly, there are 8 seats under ratlam-jhabua Lok Sabha seat, in which Congress managed to win five and BJP 3 seats
 philhal is seat par congress ke kantilal bhuriya saansad hai
 There are 8 seats under Khargone Lok Sabha seat, out of which Congress 6, BJP one and independents won one seat
 yahaan bijepi se subhash patel saansad hai
 Similarly, under the Dhar Lok Sabha seat, there are eight assembly seats, of which Congress 6 and BJP won two seats
 bijepi kii savitri thakur maujuuda samay main saansad hai
 In this way, if the voting pattern is there, then the path of returning to Khargone and Dhar seat for BJP is looking difficult
 baitool or shadol do loksabhaa siten aisi hai jiske tahat aath-aath vidhansabha siten aati hai
 In the 2018 assembly elections, both the congress-bjp parties have managed to win four seats each on both parliamentary seats
 baitool seat se bijepi ke jyoti dhurve saasand hai or shadol seat par gyaan singh singh saansad he

 To stay updated with the latest news of the general election, subscribe to Aaj Tak's election special newsletter jo mujh main chupa meraa galaa ghont rahaa haiyaa wo koi iblis he yaa meraa khuda haiyah panktiyaan fahmida riyaaz kii hai
 But where was Fahmida Riaz? Which language? Urdu, Punjabi or Hindi? Of India or Pakistan? Of humanity or of women? What did you say? What did she say, what did she write? What did you want to get? Now, at the age of 73, he has moved from this world, remembering him, his connected alphabets, the pain he suffered, the partition, the dictatorship and the seclusion
 yah aise hi nahin he ki bharat-pakistan kii is mashhoor shaayara or maanavadhikaar kaaryakarta ne lambii beemaari ke baad lahore main jab aakhri saans lee, tab bhi unka dil bharat ke liye dhadak rahaa tha
 Death anniversary Special: Can not be forgotten 'kaal-katha' and Kamatanath had its own reasons
 fahmida riyaaz uttar pradesh ke meerut main 28 july, 1945 ko janmi thim
 Father Riyazuddin was a famous educationist, after being transferred to Sindh province, the family moved to Hyderabad city in Pakistan
 magar fahmida jab mahaj 4 saal kii thim, jab pita guzar gaye
 Mother Husna Begum grew up raising them
 parivaar kaa maahaul saahitiyik tha, jiskaa un par kaaphi asar padaa
 Perhaps this is why their attachment to the women's struggle came
 padhai puri karne ke baad shaadi hui jo jaldi hi tut gai
 He was later married to left-wing activist Zafar Ali Uzan
 pehali shaadi se ek beti he, jabaki duusari shaadi se do bachche hue
 Fahmida Riyaz started writing at a young age
 padhai puri karne ke baad unhone radio pakistan or bibisi urdu main kaam kiya
 Also worked in an advertising agency in Karachi
 iske baad 'aawaaj' naam se ek urdu patrika nikaali
 The voiceless voice caught the attention of Pakistani dictator General zia-ul-haq government
 iske baad to riyaj or unke pati par ek ke baad ek tabadatod 10 se adhik mukademe darj ho gaye, or is tarah 'aawaaj' patrika khamosh kar di gai
 The husband was jailed
 ek prashansak ne riyaj kaa jamaanat lekar unhen jail jane se bachaaya
 She faced deportation and moved to India with her children and sister
 reeha hone ke baad pati bhi bharat aa gaye
 Book excerpt - Why i am a Hindu: In the words of Shashi Tharoor, his family lived in Delhi for seven years after being deported from Hindu and Hinduism, and returned to Pakistan only after the death of General zia-ul-haq
 bharat main rahane ke dauraan fahmida riyaj ne dilli ke jamiya vishvavidhyalay main rahakar hindi padhanaa siikhaa
 After returning, she joined the Ministry of Culture in the Benazir Bhutto government and was made the Managing Director of the National Book Foundation
 bhutto ke baad jab navaj sharif satta main aae tab riyaj ko 'bharat kii agent' kaha gaya
 He was threatened
 benazir ke dobaaraa satta main aane ke baad fahmida riyaj ko kaayade ajam academy main niyukti mili
 But after Benazir left she was again in trouble
 2007 main unpar ek nijee afat ai, jab bete kabir kii doobane maut ho gai
 Shortly thereafter, he was made the Managing Director of the Urdu Dictionary Board
 is tarah unke samooche jivan main utaar – chadhaav aata rahaa
 But it never stopped
 fahmida ne hameshaa pakistan sahit duniya bhar main mahila adhikaron or loktantr ke liye apni aawaaj buland kii
 He opposed all forms of bigotry and dictatorship
 fahmida ek jaani maani pragatisheel urdu lekhika, kavyitri, maanavadhikaar kaaryakarta or nariwadi thim
 He always favored generosity and humanity and presented his ideas with utmost care
 fahmida riyaaz ne 15 kitaaben likhin
 Some of his famous books include 'patthar Ki Juban', 'dhoop', 'poor Chand', 'man's life', 'godavari' and 'jinda Bahar'
 riyaj ko bhale hi pakistan main bharat kaa agent kaha gaya, lekin unhone bharat main bhi sampradayikta or kattarpanth ke badhate asar kaa virodh kiya
 She was very sad about this situation of India
 pakistan ne kattarpanthita se jo khoyaa tha, vah nahin chaahati thim ki bharat bhi uske asar main aae
 He stitched his emotions in a nam, which was called 'you are just like us'
 uski chand panktiyaan dekhen-tum bilkul ham jaise nikaltub tak kahaan chhipe the bhaivo moorakhata, wo ghamdpanjisamen hamane sadi ganvaaiakhir pahunchi dwaar tumharaare badhai, bahut badhai
 Phantom religion is dancing, will the Hindu rule rule? Will you do all the opposite! 
 
 par aisa nahin he ki vah bharat ke siyaasi maahaul se bejaar ho hataash thim
 Struggle and love were in his blood
 fahmida riyaj dilli ko apana doosraa ghar maanati thim
 Hence, his tribute written on Delhi as a tribute is presented here: Delhi! Tiri Shaan Bada Quahimiri The whole body is melting, Hug me and say to me, "who are you?" "who am I? i am a mother, i have come to disguise, i have brought love to my beloved caves in the abyss of caves

 dobaaraa poochne par ki kitni baar unhone istife kii peshkash kii thi, chidambaram bole ki unki ginati kamjor he isliye vah is bare main kuch nahin kah sakate

 Nobody thought that a lean skinny young man from Ranchi would one day become the biggest style icon of the Indian sports world
 khud emes dhoni ne bhi nahin
 Where did Dhoni have something in what he needed to become a style icon? vah na to karodpati ghar main paidaa hue the or na hi videshi skulon main unki padhai-likhaai hui
 But in Dhoni's luck, it was also written that one day his style will go into crores or Dhoni will reach there where everything will change into a style
 team india main jab dhoni shaamil hue to unke lambey bal hi unka style ban gaye
 Such style, which made even the former President of Pakistan crazy

 The comments jon abraham, deepika padukon jaise filmi sitaron se nazdikiyon ne bhi dhoni kaa stylish bana diya
 Together they had become representatives of both indigenous and aristocratic society
 lekin dhoni ko maaloom tha ki ye sab style tab tak hi unke kaam aaenge jab tak maidan main bhi pradarshan shandaar hoga

 When Dhoni joined Team India, his long hair became his style
 aisa style, jisane pakistan ke purv raashtrapati tak ko apana divaana bana liya
 Former Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf said after Dhoni's 46-ball 72 during an ODI match played in Lahore in 2006 - the field has many placards, suggesting Dhoni a haircut, But if Dhoni believes me, he should not get his hair cut, he looks very good in this
 ye dhoni ke baalo kaa jalawaa bhar nahin tha
 His innocence and success had started making him a presentable face, the things that were making Dhoni common, now Dhoni had become special with his help
 saamaanya luk, middle class parivaar or chote shahar kii pahchaan
 
 
 These became the states symbol for Dhoni
 bazaar bhi unhen apana cheharaa bana chukaa tha
 At one time, two dozen of his advertisements started appearing on TV
 chennai kii ipel team se judaav ne dhoni ko chhavi ko akhil bhartiya kar diya
 Amidst all this, Dhoni had all the qualities that attracted the youth
 khel main maidan main ve kisi baazeegar kii bhaanti faisle le rahe the to maidan ke baahar motorbikon se unka prem rah rahakar yuvaaon main halchal machaata rahaa
 Seeing Dhoni always seen in T-shirt and jeans, the section of youth has considered him as his style guru
 itnaa hi nahin chennai superkings team ke ek aid main lungi pahanakar dhoni ne dikhaaya ki vah har tarah kaa style bana sakate hai
 Soon after winning the World Cup, Dhoni got his hair cleaned
 
 This too became style
 tippaniyan Close proximity to film stars like John Abraham, Deepika Padukone also made Dhoni stylish
 ve ek saath deshaj or abhijatya donon samaaj ke pratinidhi ban chuke the
 But Dhoni knew that all these styles would only work for him as long as the performance in the field would be great
 unhone kamyaabiyon ke vakt apane paanv jameen par tikaae rakhaa, jabaki naakaamiyon ke vakt aage badhkar khud jimmedaari lee

 In fact, the case is in Gangnauli village of Baghpat, where the family members are so shocked after the death of the husband and wife under police protection that as soon as the corpses reached home after the post-mortem, they started fasting with the corpses done
 unki maang thi ki jab tak soobe ke mukhiya akhilesh yadav khud aakar unhen insaaf dilaane kaa aashwaasan nahin dete, tab tak wo laashon kaa antim sanskaar nahin karenge
 These people fear that the crooks may kill them too
 anshan kar rahe mritak ke bhai kaa kahana he ki jab tak unhen insaaf nahin milegaa, tab tak wo ann or jal grahan nahin karenge
 All the mlas from Baghpat have reached to convince these people, but they are not ready to take the dead bodies of the family members on fast

 samaajawaadee party main gundaraj he ye sabhi netaa sweekaar kar chuke he mayawati ne kaha kii mujffarnagar dangon ke baad to pradesh main raashtrapati shashan laga dena chahie tha
 Mayawati tried to describe herself as the leader of Muslims and said that the BJP and other communal forces would be weakened by the BSP getting a united Muslim vote
 unhone kendra kii samprag tathaa uttar pradesh kii sapa sarkaar ko bhi jamkar khari khoti sunaayi, vahiin bijepi ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar narendra modi ke vaadon kii vishwasaneeyata or unki netritv kshamta par bhi sawaal khadey kiye
 Mayawati, while organizing the party's campaign for the Lok Sabha elections through a careful rally of the BSP held here on her 58th birthday, said that in the year 2007, when her party came to power with full majority in Uttar Pradesh, the BSP in the past was mildly Trouble grew in Leni's BJP, Congress and SP and all three were united inside, causing damage to the BSP
 unhone kaha ki varsh 2009 main hue loksabhaa chunaav main bhi congress, bijepi or sapa dalit varg kii ladki ko parajeet karne ke liye ekajute ho gayin or unhone jahaan-jahaan bispi kaa pratyaashee majboot sthiti main tha vahaan use najdiki takkar de rahe congress, yaa bispi athwa sapa ke ummidavaar ke paksh main apane vot bhi ekamusth dalava diye
 This was also repeated in the state assembly elections held in the year 2012

 The BSP will also have to win elections from this alliance
 bispi ko sidhi ladaai ke liye khud ko taiyaar karnaa hoga
 For this, Dalits, backward, Muslims and other religious minorities who are victims of casteist system have to be linked with the ideology and policies of BSP on the basis of brotherhood
 virdohi partiyon ke gathjod kii baat party kii har choti-badi baithak main bataani hogi
 Putting to rest speculation of alliance between Congress and BSP in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections, he clarified that his party will contest on its own
 chunavi mausam main muslim card khelte hue mayawati ne kaha bispi ke gathan ke baad yahaan muslim log desh main khud ko kaaphi had tak surakshit mahasoos karne lage hai
 This party's own Dalit vote bank has stood up to support Muslims at every difficult time
 unhone aahvaan kiya ki agar muslim vot aagaamee loksabhaa chunaav main bantane ke bajaay ekajute hokar bispi ko vot de to bijepi tathaa anya sampradayik takatein kaaphi kamjor ho jaaengi
 After the election, the BSP will have to make a balance of power
 mayawati ne pradesh kii maujuuda bispi sarkaar par daliton or musalamaanon ke bich jhagada karaane ke liye vibhinn sansthaanon ke naam badalakar kuch muslim hastiyon ke naam par rakhane kaa iljaam bhi lagaaya or kaha ki daliton ne unke netritv par vishwaas karke khud ko kaabo main rakhaa
 Attacking bjp's prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi, Mayawati said how a person who cannot stop the riots in Gujarat with a population of around six crores can create mutual brotherhood and unity in the entire country
 unhone kaha ki modi apni chunavi reliyon main jis tarah lubhaavne vaade kar rahe hai, unhen dekhte hue un par yah puraani kahawat kaaphi had tak sahi baithti he jo garajte hai, ve barasate nahin
 Modi should first focus on his governed state of Gujarat where every third child is malnourished according to the CAG report
 mayawati ne kaha ki kendra main to bijepi ne samvidhan kii samiksha kii aad main daliton or pichhadon kaa aarakshan khatm karne kii sajeesh rachi thi
 The BSP did not allow their plot to succeed by agitating
 kendra main bijepi ke shasankaal main anek gambheer aatankwaadi vaardaat hui
 In Uttar Pradesh, during the tenure of this party's government, communal tension was created by demolishing the disputed structure in Ayodhya
 unhone kaha ki bhrashtachar khatm karne ke daawey karne vaale modi ne apane rajya main bhrashtachar rokane vaali sanstha lokayukta ko nahin banane diya
 The weak institution that was formed became due to the intervention of the court
 isse bhrashtachar nahin rukegaa
 The BSP leader said that Modi announced to build the Vallabhbhai Patel memorial and build the Statue of Unity for his political selfishness and on the occasion of Patel's 63rd death anniversary recently, he ran a race of senior leaders and others who pretended to vote
 Is only mayawati ne kendra main congress ke netritv main chal rahi samprag sarkaar par bhi hamale kiye
 He said that due to all kinds of wrong policies of the Center, every section including poor, laborers in the whole country is upset and corruption has reached the peak
 dhulmul videsh niti ke kaaran desh kii simaaen bhi puri tarah surakshit nahin hai
 Demanding President's rule in Uttar Pradesh once again, Mayawati said that Uttar Pradesh has now become a crime state under sp's support in the last assembly elections with the help of BJP and Congress against BSP
 kareeb do ghante ke bhaashan main unhone kaha ki mujffarnagar or shamali abhi tak dangon se nahin ubre hai
 The Center should implement harmony by imposing President's rule without delay
 bijepi jahaan in dangon main lipt logon ko sammanit karke ghinauni raajnneeti kar rahi he, vahiin congress ne danga peediton ke aatankwaadiyon se sampark hone or sapa ne raahat shiviron main shadyantrkaari rahane ke anapashnaap bayaan dekar unke jakhmon par namak chhidaka he
 These parties cannot be forgiven at all
 mayawati ne kaha ki ek taraf jahaan pradesh main bispi kii pichhali sarkaar ne vibhinn vibhaagon ke jariye vikaas kaary karakar logon ko rojgaar dilaayaa, uske vipareet sapa sarkaar ne vikaas kaary band karke chautarafa berogari badha di he
 He said that there was not a single communal riot during bsp's tenure
 desh ke anya rajyon ke mukaable hamaare rajya main kanoon-vyavastha ati uttam rahi he
 After the court's decision in the disputed case of Ayodhya, harmony and brotherhood were maintained

 bispi pramukh ne kaha ki usne sarvajan hitay sarvajan sukhaay kii sarkaar di he

 Mayawati said that instead of helping the Muzaffarnagar riot victims in the bitter cold, the SP government sent one and a half dozen ministers abroad for Sarsapate, while SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav spent money in his village Saifai like water on the celebration of the festival Called and entertained the artists of Mumbai
 unhone kaha ki salmaan khan samet sabhi kalakaaron ko kharaab halaat ke maddenjar manoranjan karne ke liye saifai nahin aana chaiye tha
 Mayawati said congratulations to the media that she showed this work better but the way the head of the government threatened the media in the press conference, it also forced the public to think about how bad this irresponsible government is going to be
 is sapa sarkaar par kuch ankush lagane ke liye yahaan loksabhaa chunaav main sapa kaa safaya karnaa bahut jaruri he
 Though the BSP chief said, but the casteist mindset has still not changed to a great extent in the media
 main party hit main media main alag-alag saakshaatkaar dene se bachati hum kyonki jab bhi maine aise intervyuu diya to use zyaadaatar tod-marodakar chapa gaya
 Aam Aadmi Party was also targeted Parmayavati also targeted Aam Aadmi Party and said that this party has ignored Dalits by denouncing them as Aam Aadmi
 mayawati ne yahaan yojit basapa kii saavdhaan raily main kaha ki dilli ke mukhyamantri aravind kejariwal ne jativaadee vyavastha kaa shikaar ho rahe logon ko aam aadmi kii sangya dekar uski aad main unki jo upeksha kii he, vah sochane kaa vishay he
 He said that parties like 'AAP' made Dalits ignore them and made them common people
 ye partiyaan daliton ko aam aadmi banaakar kuch din to raajnneetik rotiyaan senk sakati hai lekin zyada dinon tak nahin
 Mayawati said that Kejriwal spent one day watching the public and then there was a ruckus and later pretended to solve the problem by talking through the phone
 vahaan sarkari mashinari ko thik karnaa hoga
 He claimed that the Aam Aadmi Party has reduced the electricity rates to provide relief to a small number of people of Delhi, we have provided electricity even lower in Uttar Pradesh with a population of 20 crores
 bispi akele ladegi loksabhaa chunaavabispi mukhiya mayawati ne raily ke dauraan hi apni party ke chunaav abhiyaan ke shankhanaad kii ghoshnaa kii, vahiin saaf shabdon main kaha ki unki party loksabhaa chunaav main kisi party se koi samjhauta athwa gathbandhan nahin karegi
 Addressing the party's huge rally held on her 58th birthday, Mayawati said, "BSP will contest the Lok Sabha elections all over the country alone and will not tie up with any party in Uttar Pradesh or anywhere
" yah kehete hue ki media ke ek tabake main basapa ke congress ke saath gathbandhan kii charchaaen uthati rahi hai
 Mayawati said, "we are not going to have any alliance with Congress, BJP or any other party in Uttar Pradesh or anywhere and we have a direct fight with all these parties
" basapa mukhiya ne varsh 2002 ke vidhansabha chunaav ke baad bijepi ke gathbandhan main bani unki teesri sarkaar kaa ullekh karte hue kaha, bijepi ke saath pehali gathbandhan sarkaar to chah-chah maheene kii baari se chalaane kii shart par bani thi, magar varsh 2002 ke vidhansabha chunaav ke baad bijepi ne mere netritv main bani sarkaar ke liye aisi koi shart nahin thi
 Then there was the bjp-led NDA government at the Center and the BJP wanted it to form a government in alliance with it in the 2004 Lok Sabha elections and BJP fought 60 out of 80 seats in Uttar Pradesh and BSP on 20
 unhone kaha ki tab bijepi ke sheersh netritv ne unase kaha tha ki ve beshak paanch saal tak mukhyamantri bani rahen, magar uttar pradesh main samjhauta kar len
 Mayawati said, we thought that if we contested only 20 of the 80 Lok Sabha seats in Uttar Pradesh, then our party will end
 endie ne dabaav banane ke liye sibiai kaa bhi durupyog kiya magar main swabhimani hum isliye iske pehle ki bijepi samarthan waapas leti maine khud hi agast 2003 main mukhyamantri pad se istipha de diya tha

 We all know that hard work and skill are most useful at work place
 lekin bina aatmavishvaas ke na to kaam main santushti milti he or na hi kiya gaya kaam safal ho paata he
 Therefore it is most important to be confident
 aatmavishvasi banane ke liye jaruri hai ye 5 baaten:1
 Get out of your comfort zone: Everyone creates their own comfort zone, in which they keep doing their work comfortably
 aise vyakti ko agar koinaya kamsaunp diya jaae to ve ghabara jate hai or karne se manaa kar dete hai
 So always learn to accept the challenges and move forward
 jaise hi aap kuch nayaa karnaa shuru karenge aapke andar aatmavishvaas dikhne lagegaa
 2
 faisle lene main zyada der na karen:bhaag-daud bhari jindagi main ab sochane samajhane ke liye bahut kam maukey milte hai
 So develop the ability to take the right decisions as soon as possible
 jab aap gambhir faisle lene lagenge to vahiin se aap main aatmavishvaas aana bhi shuru ho jayega
 3
 aatmavishvasi logon ke saath rahen:agar aapane aise logon ko apana dost banaaya hua he jinamenaatmavishvasinhin hai to aise doston se dur rahanaa zyada behatar he
 Start meeting people who are going to impress you with their work
 4
 Avoid Negative Thinking: There are some people who always do more work than they can
 vahiin, kuch log kshamta ke anusaar bhi nahin kar pate
 If you have found something new to do in the project office, do not think that it will not happen to you
 nakaaratmak vichaar hameshaa aapako aage badhane se rokatii he
 Therefore, challenging things can also be done by believing in oneself
 5
 Think for yourself: Take time for yourself every day in which you think about yourself
 jaise ki aap kya paanaa chaahate hai? bhavishya ke kya plan hai? agar aapako nae maukey milenge to uske liye taiyaar hai yaa nahin
 These are some things that will help in boosting your confidence
 jab aap sochenge to paaenge ki aap khud ke bare main kitna kam jaanate hai
 You cannot be confident until you know everything about yourself
 america ke nirvaachit raashtrapati donald trump ke shapath grahan karne se pehle america press kor ne spasht kar diya ki trump unpar farmaan nahin chalaa sakate or patrkaar apane niyam khud tay karenge
 Columbia Journalism Revive (CJR) editor-in-chief and publisher Kylie Pope said in an open letter to Trump that "a few days before your swearing in, we thought it would be helpful to clarify that we can see the connection between your administration and the American Press Corps See how
 unhone kaha ki media or nirvaachit raashtrapati ke bich sambandh tanaavpurn hai
 The Pope said that the news that has been coming in the last few days to consider on behalf of your press secretary to remove the news media offices from the White House is in line with the same behavior that you showed during the campaign when you gave yourself news groups Banned from covering
 unhone is baat par jor diya ki trump ko apane niyam tay karne kaa puraa adhikaar he, lekin media ko bhi aisa karne ke kuch adhikaar hai
 In his eight-point charter, the pope told Trump that it would be a mistake on your part not to give journalists access to his administration, but that would be your decision and the media would find an alternative way to get information
