 India's Highly Intelligence Nuclear Submarine Project achieved another milestone last month
 beete 19 november ko duusari belistic missile pandubbi aridaman ko pani main utaara gaya
 In a small ceremony, Defense Minister Nirmala Sitharaman boiled a coconut at the submarine's tail in the drydock of the Shipbuilding Center (SBC) in Visakhapatnam
 iske baad esbisi ke dry dock main pani bhar diya gaya or pandubbi khamoshi ke saath nikal padi
 Right now it will take at least three more years for Aridaman to be dedicated by the Navy
 lekin is samaaroh main saarvajanik kaarykram vaali utani bhavyata nahin thi, jitani 2009 main arihant pandubbi ko pani main utaare jate vakt dekhi gai thi
 The four-decade-old Advanced Technology Vessel (ATV) project to build a series of nuclear submarines capable of dropping ballistic missiles is now progressing at a rapid pace
 do nai ikaayiyon es-4 or es-4 star kii kshamta arihant shrenee kii pandubbiyon se 1,000 ton zyada hogi
 Now, the space vacated by two Arihant class submarines in the SBC Drydock will be replaced by two new submarines
 ye pandubbiyaan aath belistic mixilon se las hongi yani arihant ke missile bhaar kaa doguna
 These will be launched in 2020 and 2022 respectively
 ek adhikari kaa kahana he ki arihant ko pani main utaarne kii ek or vajah esbisi kii tang jagah main es 4 or es 4 star kii assembling ke liye jagah bananaa tha
 The ATV project is the most expensive defense project in India
 chaar esasbn (nabhikeey urja chaalit, belistic missile se las pandubbi ke liye vargeekaran) taiyaar karne ke bharat ke is sabase bade raksha kaarykram kii anumaanit laagat 90,000 karod ru
 It is said
 nabhikeey urja vaali in pandubbiyon main se harek kii keemat 4,000 karod ru
 Is greater than
 isamen nabhikeey urja riector banane ke liye bhabha parmaanu urja centre (biearsi yani bark) kii dhaancha khadaa karne kii keemat or raksha anusandhan or vikaas sanghathan (diardio) kii pandubbi se prakshepit belistic misile (esaelbm) taiyaar karne kaa kharch alag he
 The project spans across India — headquartered in Delhi, submarine infrastructure unit in Gujarat, missile development program in Hyderabad, nuclear reactor in Tamil Nadu and final assembly in Visakhapatnam
 is tarah yah mek in india kaa sabase bada audyogic tantra he
 60% of submarine parts are made in India
 yah pandubbi bharat or rus ke bich samrik sahyog kaa bhi bada aadhaar bindu he
 Senior officials acknowledge that this project would not have been possible without extensive Russian design and technical support
 pandubbi ikai kii 8 disambar ko manaai jane vaali swarna jayanti ke pehle hi etivi kaarykram kaa aakaar lagbhag doguna ho gaya he jisamen nabhikeey urja chaalit chah hamalavar pandubbiyon (esesain) ko banane kii 60,000 karod kii pariyojna shaamil he
 Navy Chief Admiral Sunil Lanba told the media about the SSN project on December 1, "it has started
" vah ek gopneey pariyojna he
 Its process has started
 '' gudgaanv main nae bane pandubbi dizin centre main 6,000 ton kii kshamta vaali swadeshi esesain kii dizin kaa kaam shuru ho chukaa he
 SSN submarines are equipped with conventional cruise missiles and torpedoes but they are powered by nuclear power allowing them tremendous underwater speed and capability
 nausena ne akula shrenee kii ek or pandubbi ko 2 arab dollar main rus se lij par hasil karne ke liye baatcheet shuru kar di he
 She will replace INS Chakra which will be returned in 2022 after her lease ends
 (philhal, pichley agast main hue ek haadase ke baad chakra kaam nahin kar rahaa he
 ) On the other hand, the final design work is also underway on a new series of 13,500 tonne capacity ballistic missile submarines
 ise es-5 kaa naam diya gaya he
 These submarines will be nearly twice the weight of the Arihant class SSBN and will be equipped with 12 nuclear-capable missiles
 isse pehle is saal diardio ne apane ke-6 esaelbm project ko hari jhandi de di
 The project is to build missiles with a range of 6,000 km like ICBM
 udhar nabhikeey pandubbi kaa base project varsha ke pehle charan kaa kaam 2022 tak puraa kar liya jayega
 The submarine base will house India's SSBN fleet in special concrete structures to be built in the hills of Rambilli, 50 km south of Visakhapatnam
 is par lagbhag 30,000 karod ru
 Is estimated to cost
 teesraa paanvanabhikeey ingine pandubbi ko pani ke neeche hameshaa chalate rahane kii kaabiliyat detaa he
 These engines do not have to surface to charge batteries like conventional diesel-electric submarines (ssks)
 sataha kii laharon ke gharshan se ye pandubbiyaan bachi rahati hai isliye pani ke neeche tej gati se bhi chal sakati hai
 Like Arihant, Aridaman is also a ballistic missile submarine, ie a boomer as she carries nuclear-armed missiles, so she becomes the third leg of India's firepower after land and air
 nabhikeey hathiyaaron se las samudri plateformon ko may 1998 ke pokharan-2 parmaanu pareekshanon ke baad taiyaar kii gai bharat kii nabhikeey niti ke masaude main shaamil kiya gaya tha
 Five months from now, when India celebrates the 20th anniversary of these tests, it will have an active SSBN and a sea-based immunity of an soon-to-be-incorporated SSBN
 samrik vishleshak bharat karnad kaa kahana he, ''teesraa paanv tabhi prabhavi hota he jab aapke paas ek pandubbi hameshaa parichaalan main ho
 In our case this third leg is in operation for a short time — when Arihant exits
 '' jab koi bhartiya esasbn vishakhapatnam se baahar nikalakar bengal kii khadi main aa jaati he to pani ke neeche rahakar ek myne main vah maheenon tak adrishy ho jaati he
 His ability depends on the ability of his crew
 ve atyant nimna frequency (lef) antina ke jariye sampark main rahete hai jo pani main unhen uplabdh rahata he
 Bombers, mobile missile launchers, missile trains and ground-based launchers — each of which can be detected
 is tarah se pandubbiyaan bharat kii nabhikeey hathiyaaron kaa pehla istemaal na karne kii niti kaa mahatvapurn hissaa hai kyonki ve hamaare liye tayshuda jawaab kaa jariya ban jaati hai or ve kisi bhi parmaanu takat sampann dushman desh ke achaanak pehle hamale ko manovaigyanik rup se rokane main kaamyaab rahati hai
 These submarines are even more important when the China PLA Rocket Force can target any part of the Indian mainland with missiles equipped with nuclear weapons, and India does not have much choice to respond
 arihant ko ab 12 bi-05 esaelbm se las kiya gaya he jinaki maarak duuri 750 kilometre kii he yani use hamalaa karne ke liye dushman deshon ke tat ke najadik pahunchane tak kaa lanbaa safar tay karnaa hoga
 Currently, the 'K-4' missiles, which have a range of 3,500 km, are under testing
 diardio bengal kii khadi main vishesh rup se dizin kiye gaye pani ke neeche sthit pantun launture se in mixilon kaa chauthaa pareekshan disambar main kisi vakt karegaa
 The final test of the K-4 from Arihant is also to be done in the Bay of Bengal in the near future
 uske baad ke-5 missile kaa pareekshan hoga jo 5,000 kilometre kii duuri tak maar karne vaali esaelbm he
 The project was launched in 2015

 Very little information is available about the ATV project
 yah sidhe rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar ajit dowaal kii nigaraanee main kaam kar rahi he or ab isko lekar gahari gopneeyata barti ja rahi he
 The Navy proposed that Aridaman's launch be made high-profile, including the Prime Minister and cabinet ministers
 par is prastaav ko piemo ne khaarij kar diya
 The security imposed for this project is the highest compared to the security of any publicly known military base
 haal hi main nausena ne vishakhapatnam main esbisi ke nikat se guzarane vaali saarvajanik sadak ko suraksha chintaaon kaa hawala dete hue kabje main le liya tha
 Aridaman's landing has occurred amidst rapidly changing geopolitical developments
 chini nausena ne sheet yuddh kii samaapti ke baad se kisi bhi nausena kaa sabase tej pandubbi vistaar or tainaati kii he
 Its underwater active force is 63 submarines — five ssns, four ssbns and 54 ssks
 usne haal hi main paaramparik rup se dijal or bijli se chaalit aath pandubbiyaan pakistan ko bechi hai
 At least some of them will be fitted with nuclear weapons
 samrik vishleshak rier admiral raja menon (ritred) kehete hai, ''samay bitne ke saath-saath samudr-aadhaarit pratirohak kshamta zyada mahatvapurn hone ja rahi he
 Especially for a country like ours, which has a first-use policy
 aapke nabhikeey hathiyaaron ke thikaanon kaa pataa lagaaya ja saktaa he or maujuuda hathiyaar thikaanon kii aadha fisadi jaankaree bhi kisi ko har saal milti rahe to kai saalon main milakar yah jaankaree kaaphi ho jaati he

 ro ne apane moolyankan main is tainaati ko bharat kii suraksha chintaaon ko atyadhik badhaane vaala aanka tha

 While looking at the cameras in Wednesday's press conference, you will have an idea that there were so many channels, yet where did that news go? ek jaj kii maut ko lekar sawaal hon, kya uski bhi khabar likhane kii himmat nahin bachi he to ek sawaal aap khud se puuchhie ki har maheene cabel or akhbaar kaa bill kyon dete hai
 Why don't you donate so much money to a temple
 kisi garib kaa bhala hi ho jayega
 We did not see all the channels but the viewers told that this news is not visible anywhere, only the cameras are being seen in the press conference
 patrkaar bhi nazar aa rahe hai phir bhi 23 november ke angrezi or hindi akhbaaron main yah khabar kyon nahin he
 Judges and lawyers should not think if the question arises on the death of someone responsible in their community and that is not printed, then what is their status in front of the system
 baat baat main vakeelon ko thes pahunchati he to ve desh kii adaalaton main hangaamaa machaa dete hai magar ek jaj kii maut hui he, sab chup kyon hai
 Judge's own community is also not small at the level of India, why are they silent
 tripura ke akhbaaron ne sampadakeey khaali chhod kar saahas kaa kaam kiya he, dilli ke akhbaar ek jaj kii maut par single kalam kii khabar nahin laga paae
 Our democracy is turning into cowardice
 jiskaa nateeja aam janata ko hi bhugatna hoga
 The CBI could have spoken, the questions that have arisen on the death of Judge Brijgopal Harimohan Loya were special CBI judges
 sibiai ko bolne se koun roak rahaa he
 The silence of the opposition parties in Delhi also shows how weak their waist has also become
 hamane congress ke netaa pi chidambaram or manish tiwari kaa twitor handle dekha, is masale par koi twit nahin he jabaki donon hi vakil hai
 Aam Aadmi Party leader Ashutosh has made three tweets on this
 kairavaan kii donon report ko twit kiya he or vir kii report ko bhi
 Ashutosh has tweeted three times and said that there should be a fair inquiry into the death of Judge Loya
 report gambhir sawaal khadey karti he jiske jawaab zaruri hai
 The CPM has issued a statement
 media ke kuch hisson main sibiai jaj kii maut kii paristhitiyon ko lekar jo khulaase hue hai wo gambhir sawaal khadey karte hai
 Justice Loya's family has alleged that bribes were tried during the trial
 dhamkee bhi di gai he
 Due to the Gujarat elections, the opposition parties are not moving ahead with the formalities of speaking
 shaayad unke man main yah he ki is maamle ko lekar dhruvikaran na ho jaae lekin maamla to ek jaj kii maut kaa he
 Can one be kept silent about this fear of the death of a judge, who is also Krishna in the name of Braj from the beginning to the end
 brijagopal harimohan loya
 Well politics will keep its time, but is this compulsion of the court also, is it the compulsion of the Law Ministry or the CBI as well
 ritair justise e pi shah ne hamaare sahyogi shrinivasana jain se baat kii he
 Justice AP Shah says that Judge Loya's image was that of an honest and strict judge
 justise e pi shah ne kaha he ki bambe hai court ke mukhya nyaayadhish ko is maamle kii jaanch kerani chahie
 It is also a matter of investigation and trust in investigation
 jab bahut saare sawaal uth jaaen to maut kii paristhityaan sandigdh ho jaati hai
 The answers to these questions will be found only by investigation, about which nothing is known yet
 varanaa ye saare sawaal jo kaaphi thos lagate hai naahak atakalon ko janm denge
 i am wondering why those two judges are not speaking who insisted on Judge Loya to go to Nagpur
 ve usee colony main rahete hai yaa the, jahaan jaj loya rahete the phir unki maut ke dedh maheene tak unke parivaar se nahin mili
 Can they tell something? 22 november ke prime time main mujhase ek chook hui
 i said who was going to take Judge Loya in Auto, but in the same story it is written that two judges took Judge Loya to the hospital in Auto who took him from Mumbai to Nagpur
 bahan anuraadhaa biani ke anusaar donon jajon ne unhen yah baat bataai, maut ke dedh maheene baad jab ve milane aae the tab
 Why did the two judges not call the family at the same time when they had a heart attack
 do jajon main se ek to phone kar hi sakate the
 Did these two judges not find any vehicle in the government guest house Ravi Bhawan, in which the Viap guesthouse where judges, IAS, IPS or ministers stay, there would be ambulances etc
 or cars
 kya us vakt guestaouse ke campus main ambulance tha? kya unhen pataa tha ki shav ko lene ke kaagazat par loya kaa chachera bhai banakar koun dastakhat kar rahaa tha, kya unhone pataa karne kii koshish kii ki shav koun le rahaa he or kaise ja rahaa he
 So how much mist can be removed from them
 isliye jaanch zaruri he
 Only then will he know whether he was actually offered a bribe of 100 crores
 doosraa sawaal yah he jaanch koun karegaa
 Under whose supervision
 ek sawaal parivaar kii suraksha kaa bhi he
 Judge Loya's son has also written a letter on 18 February 2015 in which he has declared his life at risk
 usne likhaa he ki 'mujhe dar he ki ye netaa mere parivaar ke kisi bhi sadsy ko koi nuksaan pahunchaa sakate hai or mere paas inase ladane kii takat nahin he
 i am afraid that they may harm any member of our family to prevent us from doing anything against them
 hamaari zindagi khatare main he
 ' kairavaan kii story main jaj loya ke pita ne niranjan taakale se kaha he ki ve 85 saal ke ho chuke hai
 i no longer fear death
 main insaaf bhi chahta hum lekin mujhe apni bacchiyon or unke bacchon kii jaan kii behad phikr he
 Niranjan has written that the father of 85 years started crying while speaking this
 maut se jude sawaal khataranaak to he hin, report ke baad kii chuppi daraavnee he
 It seems that everyone is scared
 sab parde ke peeche se prime time dekh rahe hai
 They are stressed

 There is a freezing of snow in Delhi

 Strange irony

 Everyone is visible, but perhaps their soul is not seeing the field of Kurukshetra
 aap dekh rahe hai ki system chaahe to sibiai ke jaj kii maut ke sawaal ko kaaleen ke neeche sarka de, parivaar ko asurakshit chhod de, system chaahe to ek bas ke conductor ko maar maar kar adhamra kar de or usase hatya kaa gunaah kabool karvaa le
 On one hand, the police leave the body of a judge on the basis of the driver to take them to their village
 use shaq tak nahin hota ki kuch gadabad he
 Gurugram police, on the other hand, suspect so much of a conductor of the bus that he goes to the extent of leading him to the gallows
 reyaan skool ke pradyuman kii hatya ke maamle main pehle aaropee banaae conductor ashok ne aarope lagaaya he ki police ne buree tarah maaraa he
 Current has been imposed
 injection diya gaya he
 Under this pressure, he confessed that he committed murder
 jaanch jab badali jaati he to aaropee hi badal jaataa he
 On September 8, Pradyuman, a student of Ryan School, is killed in the bathroom of the school itself
 gudgaanv police acshan main aati he or conductor ashok ko giraftaar kar leti he
 Police say the conductor confessed that he had committed the murder
 lekin pradhyumna kaa parivaar police jaanch se santusht nahin hota he
 They constantly demand a CBI inquiry
 khud mukhyamantri manohar khatter parivaar se milte hai or sibiai jaanch kaa aadesh dete hai
 The CBI begins an investigation and the police claim begins to fly
 sibiai kii jaanch main conductor ashok ke kilaaf saboot nahin mili
 Seeing the forensic investigation and CCTV, the police arrest the senior class student of the school
 juvenil justise board ab is maamle kii sunwaayee kar rahaa he
 The comments conductor ashok kii zamaanat kaa sibiai virodh nahin karti or use 50,000 rupee ke nijee muchalke par zamaanat mil jaati he
 But after getting out of jail, you will also see the conductor Ashok's condition
 wo naa sahi se baat kar paa rahaa he or naa hi khadaa ho paa rahaa he
 According to Ashok, he was killed so badly as if he had consumed hell
 wo patrkaar se baat karte karte ruk jaataa he
 The pain begins to increase, it is not spoken
 lekin jitna usne bataaya he wo police ke kaam karne ke tareeke par gambhir sawaal paidaa karata he
 The elder officers are now talking about investigation, but the question is, what police will treat such an accused after all
 hamaari sahyogi sonal mehrotra ne conductor ashok se baat kii or agar ashok kii baat sahi he to suniye hamaari police kis tarah kaam karti he
 There is a historic order of the Supreme Court on police reform in this country, but our rulers never implemented it properly, because when these police get out of their hands, then they might not be able to do what they have been doing
 ham sab kitne laachaar ho chuke hai
 If you remain helpless like this, then one day there will be ethics

 If you want, make someone accused of murder, if you want, acquit someone

 The silence of the opposition parties in Delhi also shows how weak their waist has also become
 hamane congress ke netaa pi chidambaram or manish tiwari kaa twitor handle dekha, is masale par koi twit nahin he jabaki donon hi vakil hai
 Aam Aadmi Party leader Ashutosh has made three tweets on this
 kairavaan kii donon report ko twit kiya he or vir kii report ko bhi
 Ashutosh has tweeted three times and said that there should be a fair inquiry into the death of Judge Loya
 report gambhir sawaal khadey karti he jiske jawaab zaruri hai
 The CPM has issued a statement
 media ke kuch hisson main sibiai jaj kii maut kii paristhitiyon ko lekar jo khulaase hue hai wo gambhir sawaal khadey karte hai
 Justice Loya's family has alleged that bribes were tried during the trial
 dhamkee bhi di gai he
 Due to the Gujarat elections, the opposition parties are not moving ahead with the formalities of speaking
 shaayad unke man main yah he ki is maamle ko lekar dhruvikaran na ho jaae lekin maamla to ek jaj kii maut kaa he
 Can one be kept silent about this fear of the death of a judge, who is also Krishna in the name of Braj from the beginning to the end
 brijagopal harimohan loya
 Well politics will keep its time, but is this compulsion of the court also, is it the compulsion of the Law Ministry or the CBI as well
 ritair justise e pi shah ne hamaare sahyogi shrinivasana jain se baat kii he
 Justice AP Shah says that Judge Loya's image was that of an honest and strict judge
 justise e pi shah ne kaha he ki bambe hai court ke mukhya nyaayadhish ko is maamle kii jaanch kerani chahie
 It is also a matter of investigation and trust in investigation
 jab bahut saare sawaal uth jaaen to maut kii paristhityaan sandigdh ho jaati hai
 The answers to these questions will be found only by investigation, about which nothing is known yet
 varanaa ye saare sawaal jo kaaphi thos lagate hai naahak atakalon ko janm denge
 i am wondering why those two judges are not speaking who insisted on Judge Loya to go to Nagpur
 ve usee colony main rahete hai yaa the, jahaan jaj loya rahete the phir unki maut ke dedh maheene tak unke parivaar se nahin mili
 Can they tell something? 22 november ke prime time main mujhase ek chook hui
 i said who was going to take Judge Loya in Auto, but in the same story it is written that two judges took Judge Loya to the hospital in Auto who took him from Mumbai to Nagpur
 bahan anuraadhaa biani ke anusaar donon jajon ne unhen yah baat bataai, maut ke dedh maheene baad jab ve milane aae the tab
 Why did the two judges not call the family at the same time when they had a heart attack
 do jajon main se ek to phone kar hi sakate the
 Did these two judges not find any vehicle in the government guest house Ravi Bhawan, in which the Viap guesthouse where judges, IAS, IPS or ministers stay, there would be ambulances etc
 or cars
 kya us vakt guestaouse ke campus main ambulance tha? kya unhen pataa tha ki shav ko lene ke kaagazat par loya kaa chachera bhai banakar koun dastakhat kar rahaa tha, kya unhone pataa karne kii koshish kii ki shav koun le rahaa he or kaise ja rahaa he
 So how much mist can be removed from them
 isliye jaanch zaruri he
 Only then will he know whether he was actually offered a bribe of 100 crores
 doosraa sawaal yah he jaanch koun karegaa
 Under whose supervision
 ek sawaal parivaar kii suraksha kaa bhi he
 Judge Loya's son has also written a letter on 18 February 2015 in which he has declared his life at risk
 usne likhaa he ki 'mujhe dar he ki ye netaa mere parivaar ke kisi bhi sadsy ko koi nuksaan pahunchaa sakate hai or mere paas inase ladane kii takat nahin he
 i am afraid that they may harm any member of our family to prevent us from doing anything against them

 Niranjan has written that the father of 85 years started crying while speaking this

 It seems that everyone is scared

 On one hand, the police leave the body of a judge on the basis of the driver to take them to their village

 On September 8, Pradyuman, a student of Ryan School, is killed in the bathroom of the school itself
 gudgaanv police acshan main aati he or conductor ashok ko giraftaar kar leti he
 Police say the conductor confessed that he had committed the murder
 lekin pradhyumna kaa parivaar police jaanch se santusht nahin hota he
 They constantly demand a CBI inquiry
 khud mukhyamantri manohar khatter parivaar se milte hai or sibiai jaanch kaa aadesh dete hai
 The CBI begins an investigation and the police claim begins to fly

 The comments conductor ashok kii zamaanat kaa sibiai virodh nahin karti or use 50,000 rupee ke nijee muchalke par zamaanat mil jaati he
 But after getting out of jail, you will also see the conductor Ashok's condition
 wo naa sahi se baat kar paa rahaa he or naa hi khadaa ho paa rahaa he
 According to Ashok, he was killed so badly as if he had consumed hell
 wo patrkaar se baat karte karte ruk jaataa he
 The pain begins to increase, it is not spoken
 lekin jitna usne bataaya he wo police ke kaam karne ke tareeke par gambhir sawaal paidaa karata he
 The elder officers are now talking about investigation, but the question is, what police will treat such an accused after all
 hamaari sahyogi sonal mehrotra ne conductor ashok se baat kii or agar ashok kii baat sahi he to suniye hamaari police kis tarah kaam karti he
 There is a historic order of the Supreme Court on police reform in this country, but our rulers never implemented it properly, because when these police get out of their hands, then they might not be able to do what they have been doing

 In Tripura, the news of newspapers leaving their editorial pages empty has appeared in Delhi, but the news of the press conference that took place in Delhi on the death of the CBI judge is nowhere to be seen
 jabaki buudhvaar ke press conference main camaron ko dekhakar aapako andaaza ho jayega ki aae the to the itane channel phir bhi wo khabar kahaan gai
 If there is a question about the death of a judge, does not he have the courage to write his news too, then ask yourself one question, why do you pay cable and newspaper bills every month
 kisi mandir main daan kyon nahin kar dete hai itnaa paisa
 Only the poor will be benefited
 hamane saare channel to nahin dekhe magar darshakon ne hi bataaya ki he yah khabar kahin dikh nahin rahi he, sirf press conference main camere nazar aa rahe hai
 Journalists are also seen, yet why is this news not available in English and Hindi newspapers of 23 November
 jajon or vakeelon ko sochna nahin chahie agar unki birdari ke kisi zimmedaar kii maut par sawaal uth jaae or wo chape hi na to phir system ke saamne unki bhi kya haisiyat rah jaati he
 When the lawyers get hurt in the matter, they create a ruckus in the courts of the country, but one judge has died, why is everyone silent
 jaj logon kii apni birdari bhi bharat ke str par kam choti nahin he, ve kyon chup hai
 The newspapers in Tripura have done courage by leaving editorial vacations, Delhi newspapers could not report the single column on the death of a judge
 hamaara loktantr darpoktantr main badal rahaa he
 The result of which the general public will have to suffer
 sibiai to bol sakati thi, jaj brijagopal harimohan loya kii maut par jo sawaal uthe hai, wo to sibiai ke hi special jaj the
 Who is stopping the CBI from speaking
 dilli main vipakshi dalon kii bhi chuppi bataati he ki unki qamar bhi kitni kamazor ho chuki he
 We saw the tweeter handle of Congress leaders p Chidambaram and Manish Tiwari, there is no tweet on the issue even though both are lawyers
 aam aadmi party ke netaa ashutosh ne zarur is par teen twit kiye hai
 Tweeted both Caravan's report and Wire's report as well
 ashutosh ne teen baar twit kiya he or kaha he ki jaj loya kii maut par nishpaksh jaanch honi chahie
 The report raises serious questions that need answers
 sipiem ne ek bayaan jari kiya he
 The revelations in some parts of the media about the circumstances of the death of the CBI judge raise serious questions
 justise loya ke parivaar ne aarope lagaaya he ki sunwaayee ke dauraan rishwat dene kii koshish kii gai he
 There have also been threats
 gujarat chunaav ke kaaran vipakshi dal bolne kii aupchaarikta se aage nahin bad rahe
 Perhaps they have in mind that polarization does not happen on this matter, but the case is about the death of a judge
 kya ek jaj kii maut ko lekar bhi is dar se chup rahaa ja saktaa he, wo bhi jinke naam main shuru se lekar ant brij ke krishna hi hai
 Brijgopal Harimohan Loya
 kair raajnneeti apana samay tay karti rahegi lekin kya yahi majaburi adaalat kii bhi he, kya yahi majaburi kanoon mantralay yaa sibiai kii bhi he
 Retired Justice AP Shah has spoken to our colleague Srinivasan Jain
 justise e pi shah kaa kahana he ki jaj loya kii chhavi ek eemaandaar or sakht jaj kii thi
 Justice AP Shah has said that the Chief Justice of Bombay High Court should investigate the matter
 baat jaanch kii bhi he or jaanch par bharose kii
 When many questions arise, the circumstances of death become suspicious
 in sawaalon ke jawaab jaanch se hi milenge, jiske bare main abhi tak kuch pataa nahin he
 Otherwise, all these questions which seem quite concrete will give rise to unspeakable speculation
 main soch rahaa hum ki wo do jaj kyon nahin bol rahe hai jinhone jaj loya ko nagpur chalane par jor daalaa
 He lived or lived in the same colony where Judge Loya resided and did not meet his family for a month and a half after his death
 kya ve kuch bataa sakate hai
 In the prime time of November 22, i made a mistake
 maine kaha aato main jaj loya ko le jane vaala koun tha, magar usee story main likhaa he ki jaj loya ko do jaj aato main aspataal lekar gaye jo unhen mumbai se nagpur lekar gaye the
 According to sister Anuradha Biyani, the two judges told them this when they came to meet after one and a half months after their death
 jab dil kaa daura padaa tab usee vakt donon jajon ne parivaar ko phone kyon nahin kiya
 One of the two judges could only call
 kya in do jajon ko sarkari guestaouse ravi bhawan main koi gaadi nahin mili, jis viiapi guestaouse main jaj, iees, ipies yaa mantri thaharte hai vahaan ambulance vagairah yaa kaaren to hoti hi hongi
 Was there an ambulance on the campus of the guesthouse at the time? Did they know who was signing Loya's cousin on paper to take the corpse, did they try to find out who was taking it and how it was going
 isliye kitna kuch dhundh hat saktaa he unke saamne aane se
 Therefore investigation is necessary
 tabhi pataa chalegaa ki unhen kya vaaki 100 karod ke rishwat kii peshkash kii gai thi
 The second question is who will investigate
 kiski nigaraanee main hoga
 There is also a question of family safety
 jaj loya ke bete ne 18 farvari 2015 ko ek patr bhi likhaa he jisamen usne apni jaan ko khatara bataaya he
 He wrote that 'I am afraid that these leaders can do any harm to any member of my family and i do not have the strength to fight them
 mujhe dar he ki unke kilaaf hamen kuch bhi karne se rokane ke liye ve hamaare parivaar ke kisi bhi sadsy ko nuksaan pahunchaa sakate hai
 Our life is in danger ' In Caravan's story, Judge Loya's father has told Niranjan Takle that he is 85 years old
 mujhe ab maut kaa dar nahin he
 i also want justice but i am very concerned about the lives of my daughters and their children
 niranjan ne likhaa he ki yah bolte hue 85 saal ke pita rone lage
 The questions related to death are dangerous, the silence after the report is scary
 aisa lagata he ki sab dar gaye hai
 Everyone is watching prime time from behind the scenes
 unhen tanaav ho rahaa he
 They want to avoid that the next day nobody asks about it
 dilli main barf kii silli jam gai he
 We are finding out who is speaking on this issue
 bahut mushkil se koi awaz sunai detii he
 BJP MP Shatrughan Sinha today raised this question at the time of the launch of Ali Anwar's book, India's politician Ali Anwar

 Websites like com are turning to the pages of newspapers that Kis Kis has covered the questions related to the death of Judge Brijgopal Harimohan
 ajeeb vidambnaa he
 Whose name is Krishna, he is wandering among the characters of the Gita, look at the Pandavas or the Kauravas
 dikh to sab rahe hai magar shaayad unki aatma ko kurukshetra kaa maidan hi nahin dikh rahaa he
 You are seeing that if the system wants to raise the question of the death of a CBI judge under the carpet, leave the family unprotected, the system wants to kill the conductor of a bus and make him guilty of murder
 
 ek taraf police ek jaj ke shav ko dryver ke bharose chhod detii he ki vah unke gaanv le jaae
 He does not even suspect that something is wrong
 duusari taraf gurugram kii police bas ke ek conductor par itnaa shaq karti he ki use faansee tak pahunchane kii had tak chali jaati he
 Conducted Ashok, the first accused in the murder of Pradyuman of Rayan School, has alleged that the police has hit him badly
 karant lagaai gai he
 Has been injected
 is dabaav main usne maan liya ki usee ne katl kiya
 When the investigation is changed, only the accused changes
 8 sitambar ko rain skool ke chaatr pradhyumna kii hatya skool ke hi bathroom main kar di jaati he
 Gurgaon Police comes into action and arrests conductor Ashok
 police kahati he conductor ne kabuula he ki hatya usne hi kii he
 But Pradyuman's family is not satisfied with the police investigation
 wo lagaataar sibiai jaanch kii maang karte hai
 Chief Minister Manohar Khattar himself meets the family and orders a CBI inquiry
 sibiai jaanch shuru karti he or police ke daawey kii dhajjiyaan udne lagati he
 The CBI investigation found no evidence against conductor Ashok
 forencik jaanch or sisitivi ko dekhakar police skool ke hi senior class ke chaatr ko giraftaar karti he
 The Juvenile Justice Board is now hearing the case
 tippaniyan The CBI does not oppose the conductor Ashok's bail and gets bail on a personal bond of Rs 50,000
 lekin jail se nikalakar conductor ashok kii haalat dekhakar aap bhi sihar jaaenge
 He is neither able to speak properly nor is able to stand up
 ashok ke mutabik itani buree tarah maaraa gaya jaise usne narak bhoga liya ho
 He stops talking to the journalist
 dard badhane lagata he, usase bolaa nahin jaataa he
 But as much as he has stated, it raises serious questions on how the police works
 bade adhikari ab jaanch kii baat kar rahe hon lekin sawaal ye he ki aakhir kisi aaropee ke saath kya police is tarah kaa bartaav karegi
 Our colleague Sonal Mehrotra spoke to the conductor Ashok and if Ashok is right, then listen to how our police works
 is desh main police sudhaar par supreme court kaa aitihaasik aadesh he lekin hamaare hukmaranon ne use kabhi sahi tareeke se lagu hi nahin kiya, kyonki ye police jab unke haath se nikal jaaegi to phir wo vaisaa shaayad nahin kar paaenge jaisaa wo karte aa rahe hai
 We have become so helpless
 aise hi laachaar bane rahe to ek din aachaar ho jaaenge
 Everything is at the will of the police
 man kiya to kisi ko hatya kaa aaropee bana do, man kiya to kisi aaropee ko bari kar do
 While looking at the cameras in Wednesday's press conference, you will have an idea that there were so many channels, yet where did that news go? ek jaj kii maut ko lekar sawaal hon, kya uski bhi khabar likhane kii himmat nahin bachi he to ek sawaal aap khud se puuchhie ki har maheene cabel or akhbaar kaa bill kyon dete hai
 Why don't you donate so much money to a temple
 kisi garib kaa bhala hi ho jayega
 We did not see all the channels but the viewers told that this news is not visible anywhere, only the cameras are being seen in the press conference
 patrkaar bhi nazar aa rahe hai phir bhi 23 november ke angrezi or hindi akhbaaron main yah khabar kyon nahin he
 Judges and lawyers should not think if the question arises on the death of someone responsible in their community and that is not printed, then what is their status in front of the system
 baat baat main vakeelon ko thes pahunchati he to ve desh kii adaalaton main hangaamaa machaa dete hai magar ek jaj kii maut hui he, sab chup kyon hai
 Judge's own community is also not small at the level of India, why are they silent
 tripura ke akhbaaron ne sampadakeey khaali chhod kar saahas kaa kaam kiya he, dilli ke akhbaar ek jaj kii maut par single kalam kii khabar nahin laga paae
 Our democracy is turning into cowardice

 Well politics will keep its time, but is this compulsion of the court also, is it the compulsion of the Law Ministry or the CBI as well
 ritair justise e pi shah ne hamaare sahyogi shrinivasana jain se baat kii he
 Justice AP Shah says that Judge Loya's image was that of an honest and strict judge
 justise e pi shah ne kaha he ki bambe hai court ke mukhya nyaayadhish ko is maamle kii jaanch kerani chahie
 It is also a matter of investigation and trust in investigation
 jab bahut saare sawaal uth jaaen to maut kii paristhityaan sandigdh ho jaati hai
 The answers to these questions will be found only by investigation, about which nothing is known yet
 varanaa ye saare sawaal jo kaaphi thos lagate hai naahak atakalon ko janm denge
 i am wondering why those two judges are not speaking who insisted on Judge Loya to go to Nagpur
 ve usee colony main rahete hai yaa the, jahaan jaj loya rahete the phir unki maut ke dedh maheene tak unke parivaar se nahin mili
 Can they tell something? 22 november ke prime time main mujhase ek chook hui
 i said who was going to take Judge Loya in Auto, but in the same story it is written that two judges took Judge Loya to the hospital in Auto who took him from Mumbai to Nagpur
 bahan anuraadhaa biani ke anusaar donon jajon ne unhen yah baat bataai, maut ke dedh maheene baad jab ve milane aae the tab
 Why did the two judges not call the family at the same time when they had a heart attack
 do jajon main se ek to phone kar hi sakate the
 Did these two judges not find any vehicle in the government guest house Ravi Bhawan, in which the Viap guesthouse where judges, IAS, IPS or ministers stay, there would be ambulances etc
 or cars
 kya us vakt guestaouse ke campus main ambulance tha? kya unhen pataa tha ki shav ko lene ke kaagazat par loya kaa chachera bhai banakar koun dastakhat kar rahaa tha, kya unhone pataa karne kii koshish kii ki shav koun le rahaa he or kaise ja rahaa he
 So how much mist can be removed from them
 isliye jaanch zaruri he
 Only then will he know whether he was actually offered a bribe of 100 crores
 doosraa sawaal yah he jaanch koun karegaa
 Under whose supervision
 ek sawaal parivaar kii suraksha kaa bhi he
 Judge Loya's son has also written a letter on 18 February 2015 in which he has declared his life at risk
 usne likhaa he ki 'mujhe dar he ki ye netaa mere parivaar ke kisi bhi sadsy ko koi nuksaan pahunchaa sakate hai or mere paas inase ladane kii takat nahin he
 i am afraid that they may harm any member of our family to prevent us from doing anything against them

 ' kairavaan kii story main jaj loya ke pita ne niranjan taakale se kaha he ki ve 85 saal ke ho chuke hai
 i no longer fear death

 Niranjan has written that the father of 85 years started crying while speaking this

 It seems that everyone is scared

 On one hand, the police leave the body of a judge on the basis of the driver to take them to their village
 use shaq tak nahin hota ki kuch gadabad he
 Gurugram police, on the other hand, suspect so much of a conductor of the bus that he goes to the extent of leading him to the gallows
 reyaan skool ke pradyuman kii hatya ke maamle main pehle aaropee banaae conductor ashok ne aarope lagaaya he ki police ne buree tarah maaraa he
 Current has been imposed
 injection diya gaya he
 Under this pressure, he confessed that he committed murder
 jaanch jab badali jaati he to aaropee hi badal jaataa he
 On September 8, Pradyuman, a student of Ryan School, is killed in the bathroom of the school itself
 gudgaanv police acshan main aati he or conductor ashok ko giraftaar kar leti he
 Police say the conductor confessed that he had committed the murder
 lekin pradhyumna kaa parivaar police jaanch se santusht nahin hota he
 They constantly demand a CBI inquiry
 khud mukhyamantri manohar khatter parivaar se milte hai or sibiai jaanch kaa aadesh dete hai
 The CBI begins an investigation and the police claim begins to fly
 sibiai kii jaanch main conductor ashok ke kilaaf saboot nahin mili
 Seeing the forensic investigation and CCTV, the police arrest the senior class student of the school
 juvenil justise board ab is maamle kii sunwaayee kar rahaa he
 The comments conductor ashok kii zamaanat kaa sibiai virodh nahin karti or use 50,000 rupee ke nijee muchalke par zamaanat mil jaati he
 But after getting out of jail, you will also see the conductor Ashok's condition
 wo naa sahi se baat kar paa rahaa he or naa hi khadaa ho paa rahaa he
 According to Ashok, he was killed so badly as if he had consumed hell
 wo patrkaar se baat karte karte ruk jaataa he
 The pain begins to increase, it is not spoken
 lekin jitna usne bataaya he wo police ke kaam karne ke tareeke par gambhir sawaal paidaa karata he
 The elder officers are now talking about investigation, but the question is, what police will treat such an accused after all
 hamaari sahyogi sonal mehrotra ne conductor ashok se baat kii or agar ashok kii baat sahi he to suniye hamaari police kis tarah kaam karti he
 There is a historic order of the Supreme Court on police reform in this country, but our rulers never implemented it properly, because when these police get out of their hands, then they might not be able to do what they have been doing
 ham sab kitne laachaar ho chuke hai
 If you remain helpless like this, then one day there will be ethics
 sab kuch police kii marji par he
 If you want, make someone accused of murder, if you want, acquit someone
 gujarat chunaav ke kaaran vipakshi dal bolne kii aupchaarikta se aage nahin bad rahe
 Perhaps they have in mind that polarization does not happen on this matter, but the case is about the death of a judge
 kya ek jaj kii maut ko lekar bhi is dar se chup rahaa ja saktaa he, wo bhi jinke naam main shuru se lekar ant brij ke krishna hi hai
 Brijgopal Harimohan Loya
 kair raajnneeti apana samay tay karti rahegi lekin kya yahi majaburi adaalat kii bhi he, kya yahi majaburi kanoon mantralay yaa sibiai kii bhi he
 Retired Justice AP Shah has spoken to our colleague Srinivasan Jain
 justise e pi shah kaa kahana he ki jaj loya kii chhavi ek eemaandaar or sakht jaj kii thi
 Justice AP Shah has said that the Chief Justice of Bombay High Court should investigate the matter
 baat jaanch kii bhi he or jaanch par bharose kii
 When many questions arise, the circumstances of death become suspicious
 in sawaalon ke jawaab jaanch se hi milenge, jiske bare main abhi tak kuch pataa nahin he
 Otherwise, all these questions which seem quite concrete will give rise to unspeakable speculation
 main soch rahaa hum ki wo do jaj kyon nahin bol rahe hai jinhone jaj loya ko nagpur chalane par jor daalaa
 He lived or lived in the same colony where Judge Loya resided and did not meet his family for a month and a half after his death
 kya ve kuch bataa sakate hai
 In the prime time of November 22, i made a mistake
 maine kaha aato main jaj loya ko le jane vaala koun tha, magar usee story main likhaa he ki jaj loya ko do jaj aato main aspataal lekar gaye jo unhen mumbai se nagpur lekar gaye the
 According to sister Anuradha Biyani, the two judges told them this when they came to meet after one and a half months after their death
 jab dil kaa daura padaa tab usee vakt donon jajon ne parivaar ko phone kyon nahin kiya
 One of the two judges could only call
 kya in do jajon ko sarkari guestaouse ravi bhawan main koi gaadi nahin mili, jis viiapi guestaouse main jaj, iees, ipies yaa mantri thaharte hai vahaan ambulance vagairah yaa kaaren to hoti hi hongi
 Was there an ambulance on the campus of the guesthouse at the time? Did they know who was signing Loya's cousin on paper to take the corpse, did they try to find out who was taking it and how it was going
 isliye kitna kuch dhundh hat saktaa he unke saamne aane se
 Therefore investigation is necessary
 tabhi pataa chalegaa ki unhen kya vaaki 100 karod ke rishwat kii peshkash kii gai thi
 The second question is who will investigate
 kiski nigaraanee main hoga
 There is also a question of family safety
 jaj loya ke bete ne 18 farvari 2015 ko ek patr bhi likhaa he jisamen usne apni jaan ko khatara bataaya he
 He wrote that 'I am afraid that these leaders can do any harm to any member of my family and i do not have the strength to fight them
 mujhe dar he ki unke kilaaf hamen kuch bhi karne se rokane ke liye ve hamaare parivaar ke kisi bhi sadsy ko nuksaan pahunchaa sakate hai
 Our life is in danger ' In Caravan's story, Judge Loya's father has told Niranjan Takle that he is 85 years old
 mujhe ab maut kaa dar nahin he
 i also want justice but i am very concerned about the lives of my daughters and their children
 niranjan ne likhaa he ki yah bolte hue 85 saal ke pita rone lage
 The questions related to death are dangerous, the silence after the report is scary
 aisa lagata he ki sab dar gaye hai
 Everyone is watching prime time from behind the scenes
 unhen tanaav ho rahaa he
 They want to avoid that the next day nobody asks about it
 dilli main barf kii silli jam gai he
 We are finding out who is speaking on this issue
 bahut mushkil se koi awaz sunai detii he
 BJP MP Shatrughan Sinha today raised this question at the time of the launch of Ali Anwar's book, India's politician Ali Anwar

 Websites like com are turning to the pages of newspapers that Kis Kis has covered the questions related to the death of Judge Brijgopal Harimohan
 ajeeb vidambnaa he
 Whose name is Krishna, he is wandering among the characters of the Gita, look at the Pandavas or the Kauravas
 dikh to sab rahe hai magar shaayad unki aatma ko kurukshetra kaa maidan hi nahin dikh rahaa he
 You are seeing that if the system wants to raise the question of the death of a CBI judge under the carpet, leave the family unprotected, the system wants to kill the conductor of a bus and make him guilty of murder
 
 ek taraf police ek jaj ke shav ko dryver ke bharose chhod detii he ki vah unke gaanv le jaae
 He does not even suspect that something is wrong
 duusari taraf gurugram kii police bas ke ek conductor par itnaa shaq karti he ki use faansee tak pahunchane kii had tak chali jaati he
 Conducted Ashok, the first accused in the murder of Pradyuman of Rayan School, has alleged that the police has hit him badly
 karant lagaai gai he
 Has been injected
 is dabaav main usne maan liya ki usee ne katl kiya
 When the investigation is changed, only the accused changes
 8 sitambar ko rain skool ke chaatr pradhyumna kii hatya skool ke hi bathroom main kar di jaati he
 Gurgaon Police comes into action and arrests conductor Ashok
 police kahati he conductor ne kabuula he ki hatya usne hi kii he
 But Pradyuman's family is not satisfied with the police investigation
 wo lagaataar sibiai jaanch kii maang karte hai
 Chief Minister Manohar Khattar himself meets the family and orders a CBI inquiry
 sibiai jaanch shuru karti he or police ke daawey kii dhajjiyaan udne lagati he
 The CBI investigation found no evidence against conductor Ashok
 forencik jaanch or sisitivi ko dekhakar police skool ke hi senior class ke chaatr ko giraftaar karti he
 The Juvenile Justice Board is now hearing the case
 tippaniyan The CBI does not oppose the conductor Ashok's bail and gets bail on a personal bond of Rs 50,000
 lekin jail se nikalakar conductor ashok kii haalat dekhakar aap bhi sihar jaaenge
 He is neither able to speak properly nor is able to stand up
 ashok ke mutabik itani buree tarah maaraa gaya jaise usne narak bhoga liya ho
 He stops talking to the journalist
 dard badhane lagata he, usase bolaa nahin jaataa he
 But as much as he has stated, it raises serious questions on how the police works
 bade adhikari ab jaanch kii baat kar rahe hon lekin sawaal ye he ki aakhir kisi aaropee ke saath kya police is tarah kaa bartaav karegi
 Our colleague Sonal Mehrotra spoke to the conductor Ashok and if Ashok is right, then listen to how our police works
 is desh main police sudhaar par supreme court kaa aitihaasik aadesh he lekin hamaare hukmaranon ne use kabhi sahi tareeke se lagu hi nahin kiya, kyonki ye police jab unke haath se nikal jaaegi to phir wo vaisaa shaayad nahin kar paaenge jaisaa wo karte aa rahe hai
 We have become so helpless
 aise hi laachaar bane rahe to ek din aachaar ho jaaenge
 Everything is at the will of the police
 man kiya to kisi ko hatya kaa aaropee bana do, man kiya to kisi aaropee ko bari kar do
 It is also a matter of investigation and trust in investigation
 jab bahut saare sawaal uth jaaen to maut kii paristhityaan sandigdh ho jaati hai

 dikh to sab rahe hai magar shaayad unki aatma ko kurukshetra kaa maidan hi nahin dikh rahaa he
 You are seeing that if the system wants to raise the question of the death of a CBI judge under the carpet, leave the family unprotected, the system wants to kill the conductor of a bus and make him guilty of murder

 Earlier, in an editorial in a Chinese government newspaper, it was written directly threatening to withdraw its troops from Doklam before the situation worsens and India has to face serious consequences

 On the other hand, People's Daily, considered to be the main body of the Chinese government, has also republished a provocative editorial on its editorial page on Tuesday, 22 September 1962

 2002 ke hit and ran cese main bombai hoicourt ke salmaan khan ko reeha karne ke faisle ko ab maharashtra sarkaar supreme court main chunauti degi
 Let me tell you that in May this year, a trial court considered Khan guilty in the hit and run case of September 28, 2002
 bandra kii ek bekri ke baahar footpath par so rahe paanch logon par salmaan khan kii toyota land cruzar chadh gai thi jisamen ek aadmi maaraa gaya tha
 The comments lekin is saal 10 disambar ko hoicourt ne nichali adaalat ke is faisle ko ulatate hue 49 saal ke is abhinayta kii paanch saal kii sajaa ko radd kar diya
 The court said that the prosecution was unable to prove that Khan was driving that night and that he had drunk alcohol at the time of the accident
 saath hi adaalat ne chashmadid gavaah or salmaan ke body guard rabindra patil kii gavaahi ko bhi khaarij kar diya jisamen kaha gaya tha ki khan hi gaadi chalaa rahe the or baar baar chetavanee dene ke baavjood bhi nahin maan rahe the
 Patil died of TB disease in 2007
 bollywood ke sabase bade sitaron main se ek salmaan khan par nirmaataaon ke karodon rupye lag hue hai or hoicourt ke faisle se film industry ne kaaphi raahat kii saans lee he
 But on December 10 this year, the High Court overturned the trial court's order quashing the 49-year-old actor's five-year sentence
 court ne kaha ki abhiyojan paksh yah sabit karne main asamarth rahaa ki us raat khan hi gaadi chalaa rahe the or unhone haadase ke vakt sharaab pi rakhi thi
 At the same time, the court also rejected the testimony of Ravindra Patil, an eyewitness and Salman's body guard, stating that Khan was the only one driving and not obeying despite repeated warnings
 patil kii 2007 main tibi kii beemaari se maut ho gai
 Salman Khan, one of the biggest stars of Bollywood, is getting crores of rupees from the producers and the film industry has taken a lot of relief with the decision of the High Court
 bollywood ke sabase bade sitaron main se ek salmaan khan par nirmaataaon ke karodon rupye lag hue hai or hoicourt ke faisle se film industry ne kaaphi raahat kii saans lee he
 Bhopal: The work of literary journalism is to give breath and momentum to the stagnant society
 jo samaaj banane vaala he, uskaa swaagat karnaa
 Introducing new creativity and new talent is an essential condition of literary journalism
 yah vichaar varisht sahityakar dow
 Vijay Bahadur Singh, 11th Pt
 brijlaal dvivedi akhil bhartiya saahitiyik patrakarita sammaan samaaroh main vyakt kiye
 Senior critic Dr
 vijay bahadur singh ne samaaroh kii adhyakshata karte hue kaha ki sahitya aapaki chetana kii pahchaan banataa he
 There is also an identity of India that Ramayana, Mahabharata and Gita were written here
 us samay ram or krishna hamaare sahitya ke nayak rahe to aaj ke samaaj main dasharath majhi jaise log hamaare nayak hai
 The task of exposing such heroes should be through literary journalism
 unka kahana tha ki saahitiyik patrikaon ke bahut se sangrahntiya ank nikalate hai, lekin yadi yah patrikaayen nayi rachanashiltaa or nayi pratibhaaon ko nahin nikaal paa rahi hai, to hamen yah maan lenaa chahie ki yah patrikaayen sahitya kaa storeroom ban rahi hai
 Referring to the large number of visible authors due to the availability of social media, Dr
 singh ne kaha ki sahitya jagat main soshal media ke kaaran ek bhayankar janatantr aayaa he, usase nipatna bhi saahitiyik patrakarita ke liye jaruri he
 Because not everyone with writing skills becomes a litterateur
 unhone kaha ki saahitiyik patrakarita main sach kii raksha karnaa chahie
 Age only remembers those who live with the truth and protect the truth
 samaaroh main mukhya vaktaa ke taur par kathakaar mukesh verma ne kaha ki saahitiyik patrakarita hameshaa haashiye par rahi he or use kabhi raajnneetik patrakarita kii haisiyat nahin mil saki, lekin is tarah ke aayojan saahitiyik patrakarita ko sthapit karne main mahatvapurn kadam hai
 He said that no one can raise the question on the writers honored with Pandit Brijlal Dwivedi Award, how did they get the honor? All selections so far are the best
 verma ne sammanit lekhak arun tiwari ke kaary kaa ullekh karte hue kaha ki ham sabko 'prerana' padhani chahie
 On this occasion, Arun Tiwari said that when a person gets an award or honor, he feels good, but a pleasant surprise comes when that award is spontaneous
 prerana shuru karne kaa uddeshy yah tha ki ab tak kii sari patrikaayen sahityakaron dwaara hi likhi-padhi or prakashit kii jaati thim
 There are many famous writers across the country, whose first work was published in Prerna
 unhone kaha ki sahitya or patrakarita ek duusare ke poorak hai
 Because what happens around us in society is literature
 donon main fark bas itnaa he ki sahitya main lekhak apana mat bhi jod detaa he jabaki patrakarita main ghatana ko jas kaa tas pesh karne kii patibaddhta he
 He claimed that we have many examples here, which proves that if journalism combines with literature, then an ideological revolution is born
 unhone bataaya ki is patrika main hamane kabhi bhi ishtehaar nahin liye or na hi kabhi lengemukhya atithi dow
 Sudhir Saxena said that it is very important to keep the torch of literary journalism in the interest of society
 bazaarwaad ke is daur main saahitiyik patrakarita bahut kathin kaary he
 Whoever is doing literary journalism needs to be supported, supported and supported
 unhone anek udhaaharan dete hue kaha ki madhyapradesh main saahitiyik patrakarita kii ek samrudh parampara rahi he
 Seven literary magazines were published at one time from a small place like Ratlam
 gandhi bhawan ke mohaniya haul main media vimarsh kii ore se yojit sammaan samaaroh main saahitiyik patrika 'prerana' ke sampadak evam varisht sahityakar arun tiwari ko gyaarah hajaar rupye, shawl, shriphal, pratik chihn or sammaan patr se alankrita kiya gaya
 On this occasion Mukesh Verma, Girish Pankaj, Arvind Tiwari and the editor of Media Discourse Dr

 The police had received complaints of multiple incidents of cheating in Noida Faces 2 and 3 for some time

 2) bachapan main saurav ganguli kaa sabase pasandida khel cricket nahin balki footbaal tha
 He has always been a big fan of Brazilian player Pelé and, like Pelé, he played on his school team at the striker's position
 aaj bhi ganguli kehete hai ki vah cricket se zyaada footbaal dekhnaa pasand karte hai
 When the Indian Super League of Football started in India, Ganguly created one of his teams, Atlético de Kolkata
 3) har koi jaanata he ki australia kii team main mark wo ko jagah tab mili jab unke bade bhai steve wa ko drop kiya gaya

 There was talk in favor of Chhote Ganguly that he could bowl as well
 4) ganguli 1996 main surkhiyon main aae, lekin vah 1992 main team india kaa hissaa the, jo australia ke daure par thi
 In his first ODI, Ganguly scored only 3 runs and due to this poor performance, he did not get a second chance on the tour and was then dropped from the team
 khabaren ye bhi ain ki ganguli ne apane senior khilaadiyon ke prati sammaan nahin dikhaaya or maidan par drinks le jane se manaa kar diya haalanki aaj tak ganguli is baat kaa khandan karte hai
 5) After four years out of the team, Ganguly made his return to England tour in 1996 and scored a century in his first Test match

 8) Celebrating the natwest Trophy victory by removing Sourav Ganguly's T-shirt on the balcony of Lord's ground is one of the golden moments of Indian cricket
 darasal, kuch maheene pehle bharat main hui vanade series jeetne ke baad england ke andryu flintoff ne kuch aisa hi jashn manaaya tha
 Ganguly answered this in the Lords
 bataur captain ganguli ne bhartiya cricket kii soch ko badla or virodhiyon kii aankh main aankh daalkar har baat kaa jawaab diya
 The comments 9) 2005 main saurav ganguli or greg chapel ke bich jaisaa vivaad bhartiya cricket ne pehle kabhi nahin dekha tha
 Sourav Ganguly played a big role in making Greg Chappell the coach, but Chappell's first target was Sourav Ganguly
 chapel ne bataur captain or khilaadi ganguli ko anfit qaraar diya tha

 The two were earlier seen romancing in the 2009 film Kambakkht Ishq
 9 saal baad akshay or karina film 'good news' se parde par vaapasi kar rahe hai
 Apart from Akshay and Kareena, Kiara and Diljit Dosanjh are also in important roles in the film
 dharma prodection ise produs kar rahaa he
 According to reports, the story of the film will be based on surrogacy
 sarogesi par isse pehle saal 2002 main ek film bani thi jiskaa naam tha 'philhal'
 The film was directed by Meghna Gulzar
 bharat ne sanyukt raashtra kii report main maovadi samasya ko ‘sashastr sangharsh’ kii paridhi main shaamil kiye jane kaa kadaa virodh kiya he
 India said that due to the violence being spread by Maoist groups, it cannot be included in armed conflict under international law
 sanyukt raashtra main bharat ke sthaayee pratinidhi hardip singh ne suraksha parishad se kaha maovadi samoohon kii gatividhiyon ko sashastr sangharsh ke daayre main nahin rakhaa ja saktaa he
 He cited the recently released UN report 'children and Armed Conflict' in this regard
 singh ne kaha, ‘‘maine prarambh main hi spasht kar diya tha ki in samoohon dwaara failaayi ja rahi hinsa puri tarah se ghrunit or ninda kiye jane yogya he, lekin antarrashtriya kanoon ke aadhaar par sashastr sangharsh kii paridhi main shaamil nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 "referring to the top UN official Radhika Kumaraswamy," Singh said, "that is why we cannot accept the inclusion of these incidents in the ambit of armed struggle
" ’’ is report kaa nirmaan sanyukt raashtra ke mahasachiv baan kii moon ke karyaalay ne taiyaar kiya he or suraksha parishad ko diya gaya he
 The report mentions the inclusion of children of armed Maoists in some districts of Chhattisgarh
 report ke anusaar, ‘‘naksaliyon ne sweekaar kiya he ki bacchon kaa istemaal soochnaaon kaa aadan pradaan karne vaale tathaa mubir ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 They also believe that children have been given fewer and more lethal weapons training
 ’’ Film actress and dancer Isha Deol has advocated the opening of dance bars in India on the lines of Bangkok to prevent sexual harassment of women
 raigarh main prasiddh chakradhar samaaroh main odissi nrity kii prastuti dene pahunchi isha ne samvaadadaataaon se baatcheet ke dauraan kaha ki aise dance baar khulne se logon kii vikrut maansikta par kaabo paaya ja saktaa he
 Isha while welcoming the death sentence of four accused in the gang rape case in Delhi last December, said that another minor accused should also be hanged
 unhone filmi duniya se 'ritairement' kii sambhaavnaaon se inkaar karte hue kaha ki vah apni maa hema malini or pita dharmendra kii tarah raajnneeti main nahin aaengi or na hi vah aagaamee chunaav main kisi dal ke liye prachaar karengi
 The comments isha deol ne ladakiyon ko aatmanirbhar rahane kii sikh dete hue kaha ki bhartiya samskruti, pahanava or nrity pashchim se zyada acha he, lekin unke saath koi badasluki karata he, tab tatkaal unka pratikaar karnaa chahie
 Isha expressed concern over the fact that people are now teaching foreign dances like salsa and samba to their children due to the lack of Indian dance in Hindi cinema
 hema malini se nrity or abhinay tathaa pita dharmendra se ection seekhney kii baat karte hue isha ne 'razia sultan' jaisi film main abhinay karne kii ichha vyakt kii
 Isha, who came to perform the Odissi dance at the famous Chakradhar ceremony in Raigad, said during a conversation with reporters that the opening of such dance bars can overcome the perverted mindset of the people
 isha ne dilli main pichley saal disambar main hue gangrape cond ke chaar aropiyon ko faansee kii sajaa die jane kaa swaagat karte hue kaha ki ek anya naaballig aaropee ko bhi faansee kii sajaa di jaani chahie
 She denied the film world the possibility of 'retirement', saying that she would not enter politics like her mother Hema Malini and father Dharmendra nor would she campaign for any party in the upcoming elections
 tippaniyan Esha Deol, while teaching the girls to be self-reliant, said that Indian culture, dress and dance is better than the West, but if someone misbehaves with them, then they should be countered immediately
 hindi cinema main bhartiya nrity kam hone kii vajah se log ab apane bacchon ko salsa or sambha jaise videshi nrity sikhaa rahe hai, is par isha ne chintaa vyakt kii
 Talking about learning dance and acting from Hema Malini and action from father Dharmendra, Esha expressed her desire to act in a film like 'razia Sultan'
 isha ne dilli main pichley saal disambar main hue gangrape cond ke chaar aropiyon ko faansee kii sajaa die jane kaa swaagat karte hue kaha ki ek anya naaballig aaropee ko bhi faansee kii sajaa di jaani chahie

 Ultimately the result of the rain-affected Lord's Test was in England's favor
 match kaa pehla din barish kii bhent chadhane ke baad chauthe hi din team india ko england ke haathon pari or 159 ranon se karaari haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Due to the rain, not a single ball could be thrown on the first day, while for the rest of the day, the eye of the rain kept going
 england main viraat brigade kii sharmnaak shikast, pari se haar kar siries main 0-2 se pichdedrasal, aitihaasik lords ke maidan par jab-jab barish se pehle din kaa khel nahin ho paaya, england ne vah test match nahin ganvaaya
 This was the sixth time when the first day's game was washed out due to rain at Lord's
 jinamein se england kii yah teesri jeet rahi, jabaki teen drow rahe
 This happened 17 years later, when the first day of a Test at the historic Lord's ground could not be held due to rain

 or ye makasad he chalati train main wo khataranaak stant karnaa, jise dekh kar rongte khadey ho jaaen
 a stunt in which to succeed means life
 to naakaam rahane kaa matlab sirf maut
 Because this is the stunt that is being done in a moving train, in which the mistake of the second half can also prove to be fatal
 idhar, train kii raftaar lagaataar tej ho rahi he or udhar 15 saal kaa ladkaa daravaaje ke baahar lage handle ke sahare bedauf or beandaaj tareeke se latak rahaa he
 And his friends are not stopping him, but are making a video of his action
 train puri raftaar se ek-ek kar bijli ke khambhon ke paas se guzar rahi he or ladkaa darvaaze par jhulata hua kabhi andar or kabhi baahar ho rahaa he
 Actually, the game is to protect itself from the pillars
 jab-jab train kaa ye daravaaza khambhe ke kareeb pahunchataa he, ladkaa gajab kii tezi se andar kii taraf aata he or jaise hi khambha nikal jaataa he, ladkaa phir latakane lagata he
 In this game of death, he is sometimes hanging with both hands, and sometimes with one hand he is presenting misunderstandings among his friends
 isi bich train ek surang main daakhil hoti he or puri train ke saath wo bhi andhere main gum ho jaataa he lekin phir train ke surang se baahar aate hi vahi silsilaa shuru ho jaataa he lekin isi bich jo kuch hota he, uske bare main soch kar bhi ruh kaanp jaati he
 Suddenly the boy's hand slips from the handle and within a moment he falls down from the moving train and the boy dies on the spot
 9 agast yani id ke din stant karne ke dauraan haadase kaa shikaar hue is ladke kaa naam mohammad raja tha, jo ghar se apane doston ke saath ghoomane jane kii baat kah kar niklaa tha
 But now he will never come back
 raja jaise tamaam ladakon se hamaari guzarish he ki zindagi bahut keemtee he, isliye maut se mat khelo
 According to the report taken under the Right to Information, in the last five years, about twenty thousand people have been killed in train accidents
 yani har 4000 log train ke neeche aa kar mar rahe hai
 But still people do not learn from such accidents
 haalanki is tarah ke stant karne vaale rojaanaa 4 se 5 log pakade jate hai
 But they are left with a fine of 100 or 500 rupees
 hairaani kii baat ye he ki zyaadaatar kam umr ke ladke hi aisi harkaton ko anjaam dete hai
 Ishwar and Kamal, studying in class 12, were walking on the railway track in the Link Road area of ghaziabad with their two friends Monu and Rohit
 isi bich chaaron doston ne faisla kiya ki wo trek par khadey hokar saamne se aati train ke saath mobile par video banaaenge
 The intention was that the photos should be taken very close to the high speed train coming from the front
 isi ke baad rohit ne mobile sambhala or ishwar, monu or camel usee patari ke bich-bich khadey ho gaye jisapar train aani thi
 Incidentally, Sealdah was coming from the capital at that time and that too at full speed
 iske baad tasviren khinchne vaala or tasviren khinchvaane vaale sabhi itane magan ho gaye ki unhen ahsaas hi nahin hua ki train unke behad kareeb aa gai he or phir jab tak patari par khadey teenon doston ko iskaa andaja hotatab tak der ho chuki thi
 Rajdhani Express went out crushing them
 ishwar or monu ne to maukey par hi dam ted diya jabaki camel ne baad main aspataal main tod diya
 Although nothing happened to Rohit but death has shocked him before the eyes of three friends
 gajiabad ke railway trek par ye janvela khel kaaphi vakt se khelaa ja rahaa he lekin isaki phikr naa to jila prashasan ko he, na hi railway ko or na hi bacchon ke gharavaalon ko
 Obviously, everyone has the responsibility to prevent such unfortunate accidents

 algaavvaadi sanghathan hurriyat conference ke kattarpanthi dhade ke pramukh saiyad ali shah gilaani ne daawa kiya he ki bijepi ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar narendra modi ne unke or jammu-kashmir main algaavvaadi netritv ke paas apane doot bheje the evam kashmir mudde ke hal ko lekar apni patibaddhta jaahir karne kii peshkash kii thi taaki algaavvaadi sanghathan unke prati naram ruukh apanaaen
 However, Geelani said that he had no hope from Modi to develop a 'soft' policy on Jammu and Kashmir and refused to accept his offer
 apane haidarpura sthit awaas par gilaani ne kaha, ‘modi ne ek muhim shuru kii he or yahaan ke logon se sampark kar rahe hai
 He has approached the separatist leadership including me, which is an indication that he is trying to create a soft attitude for himself in the faction seeking freedom
 ’ buudhvaar ko dilli se waapas aane ke turant baad najarband kiye gaye gilaani ne kaha ki do kashmiri pandit 22 march ko modi ke doot banakar unke paas aae or kaha ki vah ‘kashmir mudde par patibaddhta’ hasil karne ke liye ‘pratyaksh yaa paroksh rup se’ modi se baat karen
 Gilani said, "he told me that Modi is going to become the next Prime Minister of the country and you should talk to him directly or indirectly to get his commitment on Kashmir issue
" ’ hurriyat netaa ne kaha, ‘baharhaal, maine unki peshkash sire se khaarij kar di
 i told him that Modi is a Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) man and a flag bearer of his ideology
 bijepi ke netaa hone ke naate vah kashmir par koi vyaavhaarik niti nahin apanaayenge
 Gilani said that he told the two messengers that Modi was the chief minister of the state in 2002 when innocent Muslims were killed in Gujarat
 hurriyat netaa ne kaha, ‘hamen koi ummid nahin he ki modi kashmir ko lekar koi naram ruukh or koi vyaavhaarik niti apanaayenge
 He is merely trying to create a soft stance in the separatist camp for himself
 ’ kisi kaa naam liye bagaiyr gilaani ne kaha ki un netaaon ne kashmir main bijepi ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar ke logon se mulaakaat kii jinka maananaa he ki pradhanmantri banane par modi kashmir ko lekar narmi baratenge
 'people also have the right to abstain from voting' Defending their decision to boycott the election, Geelani said that just as people have the right to vote, in the same way people have the right to abstain from voting

 He also called for 'civil curfew' on 24, 30 April and 7 May
 24, 30 april or saat may ko kramash: anantnag, srinagar evam baraamula loksabhaa seat par matdaan hona he
 BJP rejects Gilani's claim
 BJP denies that Narendra Modi, the party's prime ministerial candidate, has sent an envoy to meet Kashmir's separatist leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani, promising to resolve the Kashmir issue
 To cultivate sympathy
 gilaani ke aise daavon ko ‘badmaashi’ or niraadhaar bataakar khaarij karte hue party ne ek bayaan main kaha ki kashmir mudde par baatcheet ke liye kisi bhi doot ne na to gilaani se milane kaa prayaas kiya or na hi unase bhent kii he
 The statement said that bjp's stand that Jammu and Kashmir is an integral part of India is very clear and there is no scope for discussion
 bijepi netaa rameshwar chaurasia ne kaha ki gilaani jo bol rahe hai iske liye unhen desh ko pramaan dena chahie
 Gilani's claims are based entirely on lies and are intended to mislead the public

 yachika main kaha gaya ki insaas na keval AK47 se mahangi he, balki uskaa muqaabala bhi nahin kar sakati

 Even in 2011, the government has said to remove them, but Insaas has not been removed despite this

 congress ne mangalvaar ko kaha ki yadi aam aadmi party ‘sanvaidhanik mandandon’ kaa paalan kiye bagaiyr janalokapal vidheyak ko vidhansabha main laati he to party uskaa samarthan nahin karegi
 Congress leader Arvinder Singh Lovely even said that he will not leave the support of Jan Lokpal and will not even let him keep it in the House
 ‘aap’ sarkaar ne somvaar ko hi yah spasht kiya tha ki vah janalokapal vidheyak ko vidhansabha main pesh karne se pehle kendriya grih mantralay yaa uparajyapal ke paas nahin bhejegi
 After that on Tuesday, Congress has emphasized this issue
 congress netaa haaron yusuf ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ‘congress jan lokapal vidheyak ke khilaaf nahin he lekin ham chaahate hai ki kanoon sanvaidhanik tareeke se or kanoon ke daayre main rahete hue paarit ho
 We will approach the Lt
 Governor on this issue, as he is the guardian of the Constitution in Delhi
 ’ sutron ke anusaar, kanoon vibhaag kaa kahana he ki vartmaan niyamon ke anuroop, kisi bhi vidheyak ko sadan main rakhane se pehle us par kendriya grih mantralay yaa uparajyapal se manjuuri lenaa dilli sarkaar ke liye aavashyak nahin he
 Delhi Congress President Arvinder Singh Lovely said that the party would request Lieutenant Governor Najeeb Jung to stop the AAP government from violating the Articles of the Constitution
 lavali ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ‘raajnneetik nautanki ke liye laae gaye asanvaidhanik janalokapal vidheyak ke sambandh main uparajyapal najeeb jang ko ek gyaapan soupenge
 He said, "the government's job is to make laws and not violate them
" ’ kanoon kaa hawala dete hue lavali ne kaha ki vidheyak ko vidhansabha main pesh karne se pehle uparajyapal kii manjuuri aavashyak he
 Alleging that the feeling of 'AAP' government led by Arvind Kejriwal was not good behind bringing the bill, Lovely said, 'he promised to serve the public and make Delhi corruption free
 ab jab unke paas aisa karne kaa avasar he to vah kanoonee daayre main ise nahin kar rahe hai
 He is using the bill only for publicity

 But these mistakes can be rectified over time
 agar aap jivan main safalataa chaahate hai to iske liye jaruri he ki apni galatiyon se seekhen or unhen doharaaen nahin
 When the daily routine becomes the shout of the boss, then keep yourself cool and make your mistakes
 If you really want to learn from your mistakes then first of all learn to accept mistakes
 aisa karnaa seekhney kii ore pehla kadam hoga
 There should be so much courage in us that we can accept our mistakes in front of others
 galatiyon se bachane ke liye bahaane or apana bachaav karne kii koshish bilkul naa karen
 Doing so may harm you in the future

 First of all try to understand where the mistake happened to you and then try to find a solution
 galati karne ke baad galati sudhaarney kii koshish na karnaa dobaaraa galati karne ke baraabar he
 Warning: These 2 mistakes are made during job interview, so get help from others, do not feel shy while seeking help from others to rectify your mistake
 saamne vaala aapke bare main kya sochega ye naa sochen
 We all need a mentor or experienced person for guidance
 ham unke anubhavon se sikh le sakate hai
 Remember mistakes are the ladder to success, just need to learn from them

 The problem of burning stubble has increased compared to last year
 In Punjab this year, in case of stubble burning 48,684 places in Punjab, there may be strictness to burn stubble after the scam of Supreme Court, but even if this year 2019 as compared to last year 2018 If we look at the cases by the end of the year, the cases of stubble burning have increased by 12 percent
 pichley saal jahaan 23 sitambar se 12 november tak 43,339 paraali jalaane ke maamle saamne aae the
 At the same time, during these 51 days in 2019, cases of stubble burning have been reported at 48,684 places
 agar pichley 24 ghanton kii baat kii jaae to sirf mangalvaar ko hi sangrur main 113, bathinda main 69, barnaala main 97, ludhiana main 42, mansa main 54, patiala main 70 or moga main 27 jagah paraali jalaane ke maamle saamne aae hai jabaki anya jilon main bhi paraali jalaane ke maamle lagaataar saamne aa rahe hai
 In the last 24 hours, 145 farmers have also been booked in the state for burning stubble
 saal 2018 kii tulana main 2019 main ab tak punjab ke fazilka ko chhodkar har jile main paraali jalaane ke maamalon kaa akda is saal kii tulana main badha hi he
 The situation has become such that the air quality index of major cities of Punjab has also reached alarming levels
 bathinda 359, patiala 313, mandi govindgarh 251, khanna 246 tak pradooshan kaa AQI pahunchaa hua he
 Although, the Punjab government has spoken of strict action on the farmers, but the farmers have made it clear that until the resources and financial support are provided to the farmers to deal with the straw, they cannot do any concrete solution to the straw
 Huh
 adhikari bane bandhakapanjab ke bhavanigarh ke gharaachon gaanv main kisaanon ne paraali jalaane par karrwai karne aae do adhikariyon ko bandhak bana liya jiske baad police kii team ne maukey par pahunchakar kadi mashkkat ke baad donon adhikariyon ko chhudvaaya
 In Mansa in Punjab, farmers also staged a strong protest outside the Mansa DC office to protest against the cases filed by their fellow farmers for burning stubble
 kisaanon kaa kahana he ki jab tak paraali jalaane ko lekar kisaanon par darj kiye gaye maamle waapas nahin liye jate tab tak wo aise hi pradarshan karte rahenge
 The Punjab government says that following the instructions of the Supreme Court, stern burning farmers are being toughened by the government, but there are many small farmers who despite purchasing subsidy from the state government to buy machines to manage the straw There is no money and those farmers fire the stubble in compulsion
 punjab sarkaar ke cabinet mantri sadhu singh dharmasot ne ek baar phir se gend centre sarkaar ke paale main daal di or kaha ki jab tak centre sarkaar kisaanon ko aarthik madad muhaiyaa karwaane ke liye punjab sarkaar ko fund nahin detii tab tak wo paraali kaa samaadhaan kisaanon se puri tarah se nahin karvaa sakate hai
 Sadhu Singh said that the government is also trying to get the farmers on the right path by persuading those farmers who are adamant on burning the stubble and are taking hostage and staging demonstrations
 is saal jin ilaakon main paraali jalaane ke zyada maamle saamne aae hai, un ilaakon par khaas najar rakhi ja rahi he or pataa lagaaya ja rahaa he ki aakhirkaar kyon vahaan par kisaan paraali jalaane kii jid par ade hai or usee hisaab se in ilaakon main paraali kaa samaadhaan karne ke liye rajya sarkaar koshish karegi

 Ever since the Indian Army has given a befitting reply to Pakistan by entering pok, the issue of surgical strikes has been the subject of discussion all over the country
 raajnneetik partiyaan to isapar raajnneeti kar hi rahi hai lekin aam janata ke bich bhi iskaa kaaphi zikr ho rahaa he
 Even though the controversy regarding surgical strikes is constantly deepening, it is being said that this is not the first time, but there are such surgical strikes in the UPA regime
 lekin bhartiya sena ne jo kiya he wo vaaki kaabiletariff he
 Saluting the same spirit of the Indian Army, a Punjabi song has recently been launched on Surgical Strike which is also being well liked on youtube
 is gane menarmi kii uniformamen kuch faujee bharat kii is jeet ko celibratt karte najar aa rahe hai
 In this song, the soldiers are warning Pakistan that they should leave Kashmir's demand or else Lahore can be lost, pok can also get out of your hands
 1971 kii tarah ham ek baar phir tumhen haraa denge
 
 
 These lyrics of the song are really encouraging

 vibhaag ke jariye bheje gaye notice kaa jawaab dete hue unhone kaha he ki wo vaishvik chetana or barish ke liye sadhana main tallin hai
 For this reason, he cannot physically attend the office
 pichley 8 maheene main rameshchandra ne sirf 15 din hajiri lagaai he
 In response to the notice, he has also written that due to his sadhana, it has been raining well for the last few years and it has been possible only because of calling himself Vishnu avatar
 unka daawa he ki 16 sitambar 2016 se duniya main ek barphir satyuga kii shuruyataho gayi he aise main ab wo daftar nahin aa sakate
 These replies from Yadharameshchandra of Dilai IG Panda reminded of IPS officer DK Panda, who came to the discussion by calling himself an avatar of Radha

 maalya ne twit kiya, 'main adarpurvak poochna chahta hum ki pradhanmantri meraa paisa lautaane kaa ofer sweekaar karne ke liye bainkon ko nirdesh kyon nahin dete? iske baad vah kingfisher ko die gaye lone kii puri vasuuli ke liye kam se kam credit kaa daawa kar sakate hai' twit main maalya ne saath hi daawa kiya he ki usne karnataka hoicourt ke aage bhi maamle ko sulajhane ke liye ofer diya tha
 Following on from my earlier tweet, i respectfully ask why the Prime Minister is not instructing his banks to take the money i have put on the table so he can at least claim credit for full recovery of public funds lent to Kingfisher
 ek anya twit main maalya ne kaha, 'media reports main idi ke hawaale se bataaya ja rahaa he ki maine apni sampatti chhupaai he
 If that were the case, why would i disclose assets worth Rs 14,000 crore to the court? It is shameful to mislead the public
 'the Prime Ministers last speech in Parliament was brought to my attention
 He is certainly a very eloquent speaker
 i noticed that he referred to an unnamed person who “ran away” with 9000 crores
 Given the media narrative i can only infer that reference is to me

 maalya ne twit kiya tha ki westminster magistrate adaalat ke 10 disambar, 2018 ke aadesh par faisla aane ke baad maine apil kii apni manshaa ke bare main bataa diya he
 i could not appeal before the decision of the Home Minister
 ab main apil karuunga
 Am appalled to say the least at the media reports on the Enforcement Directorate claims that i hid my wealth! If there was hidden wealth how could i put approximately 14,000 crores worth of assets openly in front of court? Shameful misleading of public opinion but unsurprising
 maalya ke khilaaf bharat main 9,000 karod rupee kii dhokhadhadi or mani landring ke maamle main karrwai kii jaani he
 Mallya's extradition was approved by Britain's Home Minister Sajid Javid

 com / tmnfmonffs deepika padukon or priyanka chopra indinon hollywood main apane hunar se logon ko aakarshith karti najar aa rahi hai
 While Deepika is seen to surprise the fans with the Hollywood film XXX: The Gender Cage, Priyanka has also started her footsteps in Hollywood after the success of Quantico
 haal hi main yah bhi khabar ai thi kidipika padukonne tom krooj kii film 'da mummy' ke liye bhi audishan die the
 However, the matter could not be reached
 lekin ab charchaa he ki priyanka auradipikaco agali james bond girl ke role ke taur par liye jane ke kayaas lagaae ja rahe hai
 However, no hint has been received from both the actresses about this
 bond franchisi kii pichhali film'spector'saal 2015 main relies hui thi
 It was heard that Deepika and Priyanka are seen pushing for the Bond girl's dream role
 is bare main baat karte hue ek sutara ne Deccan Chronicle ko bataaya he ki deepika ne film XXX ko zyada se zyada dats de di hai or vahiin priyanka bhi 'quantico' kii shooting ke baad ab film'bewaach'kii shooting main jute gayi hai
 The teams of both actors are doing a great job and also making these stars aware of Hollywood's renowned studios
 or aisa lag rahaa he ki donon stars ne apane agents se yah saaf kah diya he ki unki hollywood filmon main chote-mote kirdaaron main unki koi dilchaspee nahin he
 If Deepika and Priyanka really got a chance to become James Bond girl then it could prove to be the biggest break for any Bollywood actress till now

 For this, tombs were dug there, including the graves of Rafi, Naushad, Madhubala etc
 ’’ is imaarat kii andruni sajja ke liye aavedan karne waalon main roopesh bhi the lekin yah kaam unhen nahin mila
 Beanu Nair, who runs the Rafi Fan Club, says, "now we gather near a coconut tree standing near Rafi's grave and pay tribute to him
" ’’ 31 july 1980 ko dil kaa daura padane se is duniya ko vidaa kehane vaale rafee ne hindi filmon ke lagbhag har bade sitare ko apni aawaaj di thi
 He was awarded the Padma Shri in 1965
 bollywood main baar baar pich badal kar gane yani yodiling kii shuruuaat rafi ne hi pashrvagayan ke dauraan kii thi
 Some of his old songs 'hello Sweet Seventeen' 'O Chale Ho Kahan', 'dil Ke Ain Mein' and 'se Rippy Tippi Ho Gayi' are examples of this
 24 disambar 1924 ko janme rafi kii gayan pratibha unke mamaa ne pahachaani or phir rafi ne ustad bade gulam ali khan, ustad vaahid khan, pandit jeevanlaal mattu or firoz nizami se shastreey sangeet siikhaa
 Rafi came to Mumbai from Lahore in 1944 and a journey of singing and an unbreakable relationship with Naushad began
 pehle naushaad kii pasand talat mahmud the, lekin baad main naushaad is kadar rafi ke diwane hue ki is jodi ne 149 geet die
 There were 81 songs of Rafi's Solo
 1950 ke dashak se 1960 ke dashak tak rafi opi naiyar, shankar jaykishan or es di burman jaise sangeetkaaron ke pasandida gayak bane rahe
 In the year 1945, Rafi sang "tera Jalwa Jo Dekha" for "laila Majnu" and also appeared on screen

 Rafi stayed in India
 varsh 1948 main rafee ne rajendar krishna kaa likhaa geet ‘suno suno i duniya waalo baapu kii ye amar kahani’’ gaaya
 On hearing this song, the then Prime Minister Pt Jawaharlal Nehru invited Rafi
 rafi ne nehru ke ghar par unhen yah geet sunaaya
 On Independence Day this year, Nehru presented Rafi a silver medal

 Bollywood actor and BJP MP Paresh Rawal recently tweeted a controversial tweet
 kaaphi vivaad hone par unhone wo twit delit kar liya
 He has said that Twitter had threatened to delete the account for not deleting that tweet
 paresh rawal ne ek letters jari kiya he jisamen likhaa he, ‘is letters ke jariye main apane sabhi saporter or desh ke nagarikon ko bataanaa chahta hum ki 21 may ko kiye gaye mere twit ko twitor ne mujhase na delit karne par acount delit karne kii dhamkee di’unhone apane letters main apane twit kaa bachaav kiya he or kaha he ki wo apane delit kiye gaye twit kaa bachaav karte rahenge
 In fact, Paresh Rawal had said in a tweet made on May 21, 'arundhati Roy should tie on army jeep'
 ye twit unhone pichley maheene kashmir main ek protester ko patharbaajon ke khilaaf army shield ke taur par yuj karne ke sandarbh main kiya tha
 He tweeted and said that Arundhati Roy should be tied in the army jeep instead of the stone-pelters
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki paresh rawal kii tippanee se pehle kuch pakistani channelon par yah khabar ai ki kashmiri yuvak ko jeep par baandhne kii ghatana ke baad arundhati raay kashmir gai thim or vahaan unhone pakistan ke samarthan main bayaan diya
 While Arundhati says that she never went to Kashmir in the meantime
 gauratlab he ki singer abhijit bhattacharya ke acount ko twitor ne suspend kar diya he
 She recently made vulgar comments on women by tweeting several
 iske baad mashhoor gayak sonu nigam ne unka samarthan karte hue apane twitor acount delit kar liya he
 He tweeted 24 before deleting and said that about 90 percent of the people on Twitter use such a language, so why doesn't Twitter suspend their accounts
 pulavama hamale ke baad jis tarah puri duniya aatankwaad ke khilaaf bharat ke saath khadi dikhi usase ummid jaagi thi ki aatanki sargana masood ajahar ko lekar china kii raay ab to badalegi
 In the UN Security Council, he will support the declaration of Masood Azhar as a Global Terrorist
 taaki masood ajahar par shikanja puri tarah se ksaa ja sake
 But like the last three times, China got cheated for the fourth time
 lekin ab masood azhar ko lekar china kii raay achaanak badal gai
 Now China will not save Masood Azhar
 ab usne sanyukt raashtra main masood kaa masalaa jald hal hone kii baat kahi he
 China has suddenly increased the difficulties of Pakistan by saying that it understands India's concern about Masood Azhar and the issue of Masood is not over yet
 bharat main china ke rajdoot luo jhahui ne bharosa dilaayaa he ki yuan main masood ajahar kaa maamla jald nipatega
 He said that Masood's case has been put on technical hold right now
 ye vahi china he jo ab tak chaar baar sanyukt raashtra kii suraksha parishad main vito kaa istemaal kar masood ajahar ko global tebrist ghoshit kiye jane se roktaa aayaa he
 But now after all-round pressure, for the first time, China has said such things about Masood
 pichley 16 saalon main hindustan main hue bees se zyada aatanki hamalon kaa gunahagaar, saikadon begunaahon kaa qaatil or duniya ke sabase ghaagh aatankwaadiyon main se ek ye he moulana masood azhar
 The same Masood Azhar, whose organization jaish-e-mohammed was declared a terrorist organization by the United Nations in 2001, 18 years ago
 magar kamaal dekhie ki vahi sanyukt raashtra 18 saal baad bhi ye faisla nahin kar paa rahaa he ki jiskaa sanghathan aatankwaadi he us sanghathan ke mukhiya ko wo aatankwaadi qaraar de yaa naa de?bharat main ek badi puraani kahawat he
 Give a hand ek haath le
 But this saying begins to change as it reaches Pakistan via China
 pakistan ke saath china is kahawat ko thodaa badalakar istemaal karata he
 That is, give one hand and take many hands
 hindustani kahawat ke is chini style ko thodaa aasaan lafzon main samajhie
 This means that in the case of terror, China will save the world from being insulted by Pakistan
 magar pakistan ko uske is ehsaan kaa badla chukaana hoga
 And this change will be in a little Chinese style
 chini style kaa badla hota kya he ye ham aapako ek ek karke samajhaayenge
 But first, know how China put the shame of Pakistan in front of the international fraternity
 china ne phir kii aatanki masood azhar kii madad
 There was an obstacle in the UN being declared a global terrorist
 masood ajahar par 10 saal main china ne chauthi baar ye chaal chali he
 And vetoed Masood Azhar to save him
 pichley 18 saalon se
 
 yani 2001 ke sansad hamalon se 2019 ke pulavama hamale tak
 This dreaded terrorist of Pakistan has given many wounds to India one after the other
 duniya ke tamaam deshon ne mana kii jaish kaa ye sargana puri insaaniyat ke liye khatra he
 So it should be declared a global terrorist so that terror can be tackled
 magar pichley 10 saalon se china aatank ke is sargana kii dhaal bana baitha he
 And whenever India tried to put it in the Global Terrorist List
 tab-tab china ne sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad main adnga daal diya
 However, after the Pulwama attack, this time on February 27, this proposal was brought to France, Britain and America
 10 se zyaada deshon ne prastaav kaa samarthan kiya
 It was decided that if no member of the Security Council objected to this
 jaish ke sargana masood azhar ko antarrashtriya aatanki ghoshit kar diya jayega
 In this sense, the proposal deadline was ending on Wednesday, March 13 at 12:30 pm
 laga is baar to masood ko uske kiye kii sazaa mil hi jaaegi
 But just one hour before the offer deadline
 china ne is par adnga laga diya
 China said that it has said earlier that the action without evidence is wrong
 jis par america ne china se guzarish kii thi ki wo samajhadaari se kaam len
 For peace in indo-pak it is necessary to declare Masood as a global terrorist
 china ke adnge ke baad masood azhar ko antarrashtriya aatanki ghoshit kiye jane kii ek or koshish naakaam ho gai
 However, following the proposal, members of the Security Council have given a clear warning to China that if it does not change its stand on Masood Azhar, other options of action are also open
 kul milakar pichley 10 saalon main china masood ajahar ko bachaane ke liye chaar baar chaal chal chukaa he
 In 2009 India itself came up with this proposal
 vahiin 2016 main bharat ne pi-3 yani america, france or britain ne milakar prastaav pesh kiya tha
 In 2017, only 3 countries had proposed this proposal
 or is baar bhi pulavama aatanki hamale ke baad ye prastaav france, britain or america lekar aayaa
 However, this time China has not used veto power to topple this proposal, but according to sources, China has put the proposal on 'technical hold'
 technical hold kaa matlab he ki use prastaav par vichaar karne ke liye kuch or vakt chahie
 It is not so that the sword of Masood Azhar being declared an international terrorist hangs on his head
 nateeja jo bhi ho lekin ab masood ajahar ko lekar china kaa nayaa bayaan ummid jagaata he
