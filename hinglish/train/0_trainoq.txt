 dwarka-sharada peeth ke shankaracharya swami swaroopanand ne sai baba kii puja na karne kii baat kah kar vivaad ko janm de diya
 Aaj Tak's Anjana Om Kashyap spoke to him on this issue
 pesh hai pramukh anshahsai puja par shankaracharya ko kya aapatti he?sanathan dharm main ayogy kii upasna nahin hoti
 The fruit of worshiping the unworthy is the reverse
 sai asaty hai kyonki unki maut ho chuki he
 Hindus do not worship any unconscious
 ham murti puja karte bhi hai to murti main praan pratishtha karne ke baad
 There is no such ability in Sai to worship him
 sai chilam pite the or maansaahaar karte the
 They forcibly fed meat to Brahmins on Ekadashi
 sai kehete the sabakaa maalik ek he
 He did not call himself God
 sai kehete the ki sabakaa allaah ek he
 Who can be worshiped by someone else who is the owner? The objection is with the personification of Sai or the courtesan being built around them? Our objection is not with Sai but worship of his devotees
 unke bhakt unke hi siddhanton kaa paalan nahin karte
 People are being confused in the name of Sai
 aapke virodh ke peeche dharm kaa arthshaastra to nahin? kyonki zyada chadhaava ab sai mandiron main jaataa he
 We have no objection to the ascensions to Sai
 dhan se koi bada nahin hota, bhagwaan nahin banataa, nahin to ambani desh main sabase amir hai, vah bhagwaan ban jate
 Sai Darshan spreads the illusion of wishing, why did Sai never get so much offerings? You are also called Congressman
 maine ‘angrejo bharat chodo’ andolan main hissaa liya tha
 i am the only Shankaracharya who participated in the freedom struggle
 mujhe congress kaa kareebi bataanaa sirf sajeesh he
 Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Raman Singh is my disciple
 main unke ghar rukta hum
 Digvijay Singh is my disciple, i am not his disciple
 modi pradhanmantri bane hai
 Your opinion? When they fulfill the promise, then opinion will be formed on them
 acha kaam karenge to unka samarthan karenge
 They are promoting Hindi
 is mudde par unke saath hum
 Uma Bharti says that faith in Sai is personal faith
 ram ko chhod sai bhakt kaise ho gayi uma? unako main bachapan se jaanata hum
 Ram has grown up by telling the story
 ve aaj jo bhi hai, ram naam kii hi vajah se hai
 Uma Ram should remain a devotee, do not be confused
 unke guru mere paksh main hai or ye unki cheli hokar meraa virodh kar rahi hai, ye thik nahin
 How far will this fight go? There is growing controversy and backlash from the protest and protest of Sai devotees
 saare sadhu-sant or akhaade mere paksh main sadakon par utarane ko taiyaar hai
 i have not made any objectionable talk
 yah mujhe badnaam karne kii sajeesh he
 Hinduism is being maligned
 maine reporter ko maaraa nahin, sirf dur bhagaaya tha
 i am not a political person

 The rupee fell 12 paise to a 16-month low of 68 against the dollar in early trade on Monday as the US currency strengthened amid compromises between China and the US to abandon the trade war
 12 rupee prati dollar par aa gaya
 The comments kaarobaariyon ne kaha ki america ke vitt mantri steven neuchin ke china ke saath vyapaar yuddh ko roke jane kii baat kehane ke baad ayaatkon evam bainkon se dollar kii maang badhane se rupee main giravat kaa daur rahaa
 Apart from this, the domestic currency was also under pressure due to high crude oil prices and weakness in Asian currencies
 shuukravaar ke kaarobaari din main dollar ke mukaable rupaya 30 paise girakar 68 rupee prati dollar par band hua tha
 Traders said that the rupee was in decline due to increasing demand for dollars from importers and banks after US Finance Minister Steven Newchin called for a halt to the trade war with China
 iske alaava kachche tel kii ucch keemton or asian mudraon kii kamajori se bhi gharelu mudra par dabaav rahaa

 The rupee had fallen 30 paise to close at 68 per dollar against the dollar on Friday trading day
 karnataka chunaav main ab kuch din hi shesh rah gaye hai
 In this last phase of campaigning, the leaders of every party have put a lot of effort
 matadaataaon ke bich apni chhap chhodane ke liye sabhi dal soshal media ke alaava chunavi reliyon or road sho main apni puri takat laga rahe hai
 For the first time in Karnataka, social media is playing a big role during the elections
 bijepiur congress ke bich to maano soshal media par mahabharat chhidi hui he
 The attack remains on congresswhatsapp, Facebook and Twitter The cyber army of both parties are not only active against each other but are carrying out deadly attacks with new weapons every day
 bijepi karnataka mencongreska kila bhejne ke liye tatparta ke saath aakraamak hone kii koshish kar rahi he to vahiin congress dakshin main apana kila bachaane ke liye hamalon kaa munhtod jawaab de rahi he
 On social media, no one knows the truth of both the party's liquor and allegations, apart from the cyber forces running the keyboard, but what is visible is the strength of propaganda of these two parties on cyber media
 akele ek kshetreey netaa ne sambhala morchakarnatakake chunaav main ek baar phir dekhne ko mila he ki kaise ek kshetreey netaa ne desh ke sabase kaddavar netaa or pradhanmantri modi ke khilaaf akele hi morcha kholaa hua he
 The road in Karnataka is not so easy for the BJP because the Congress face and Chief Minister Siddaramaiah in Karnataka is like a strong general in the field
 bijepi jaise hi soshal media par koi daawa lekar siddharmaiya yaa unki sarkaar ko aaropon ke ghere main khadaa karne kii koshish karti he, congress kii sibar sena or khud mukhyamantri siddharmaiya turant hi soshal media ke platform par palatakar waar shuru kar detii he
 In an aggressive manner, siddaramaiahbjp alleged in a press conference that Siddaramaiah had accepted a valuable gift from an economic fugitive from the country working in Malaysia and shared photos as evidence, Siddaramaiah immediately retaliated on social media to Prime Minister Modi Sharing the photos with Nirav Modi raised a question with the BJP itself
 aisa pehali baar nahin hua jab siddharmaiya ne modi or bijepi ko unheen ke shabdon main jawaab diya
 Siddaramaiah is playing the role of Congress captain in Karnataka in an excellent manner
 vahi bijepi bhi aankadon ke jariye soshal media ke sabhi platform par siddharmaiya sarkaar par sawaalon ke gole daag rahi he
 In the Congress-mukt Bharat campaign, the BJP is desperate to hoist its flag in Karnataka and that is why it has taken all its surmounts like Yogi, Modi and Amit Shah in the Rann of Karnataka
 vahiin, congress kii ore se bhi rahul gandhi, manmohan singh or duusare netaaon ne bhi siddharmaiya ke netritv main apane kile kaa morcha sambhala he
 In the field of cyber warfare, no one is proving to be less than anyone
 modi banaam siddharmayapradhanmantri chunavi reliyon main siddharmaiya par sidhe-sidhe aarope thokate hai to bina vilamb kiye siddharmaiya soshal media ke tarkash se tir nikaalkar pradhanmantri kii ore chalaa dete hai
 If Amit Shah drops the arrow of accusations, then Siddaramaiah also immediately dismisses those attacks with a shield
 yogi bhi prachaar karne aae to siddharmaiya ne uttar bhartiya vaala brahmastra bhi chalaa diya
 Siddaramaiah also gave an open challenge to Modi and Yeddyurappa to openly debate the issue through advertisements in newspapers
 unhone bahes ke liye jagah or taarikh bhi unhen khud tay karne kaa mauka diya
 Now the political mercury of the propaganda which has reached the last phase in the state is increasing with increasing heat
 69 saal ke hue pradhanmantri narendra modigujrat main manaayenge apana janmdinamodi se kai gur sikh sakate hai yuvaaj pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa aaj janmdin he
 Even at this age, PM Modi is a political icon not only for the youth of the country but also around the world
 fitness mantra hon, fishan trend yaa phir soshal media par popularity
 
 har jagah piem modi kii dhak he
 Born on 17 September 1950 in Vadnagar, Gujarat, Modi is today at the highest point of popularity
 li se hatakar faisle lenaa or mishan mod main kaam karnaa piem modi kii pahchaan he
 There are 10 aspects of his working style and lifestyle that can serve as a management mantra for everyone at any time
 1
 Out of the box thinking, the biggest feature of PM Modi is that he takes decisions out of the box
 satta main aane ke baad piemo main adhikariyon or karmchaariyon main anushaasan laane ke liye sabase pehle piem modi ne khud kaa udhaaharan pesh kiya
 He himself is busy working for 14 to 18 hours
 unhone sarkaar kii baithkon ko dilli se baahar bhi anya rajyon main yojit kin
 Meetings and meetings with foreign heads of state outside Delhi
 mantriyon or saansadon ko dilli se baahar jameen par kaam karne ko bheja
 Talked about making Swachh Bharat and toilets from the ramparts of the Red Fort and made public movement for cleanliness and health awareness
 2
 In team and mission mode, KPM Modi is seen doing everything in team and mission mode
 2014 main satta main aate hi unhone team india kaa concept rakhaa
 He took many initiatives to develop all departments and agencies as Team India
 piem modi ne 2022 tak new india kaa lakshya rakhaa or sabko ghar-khaanaa-pani muhaiyaa karaane ke liye kai yojanaayen shuru kin
 Started PRAGATI meeting to approve pending projects
 jab piem modi ne swatchta abhiyaan ko shuru kiya to 9 hastiyon ko nominete kar ek chen system banaaya jo dekhte hi dekhte ek bada abhiyaan ban gaya
 3
 aage aakar netritv kaa sahaschunavi jang main apane chehre ko daanv par lagaakar pradhanmantri ne siyaasi saahas kaa bhi hameshaa parichay diya he
 Not only in the Lok Sabha, in the campaign leading up to the state assembly elections, the BJP comes on the ground of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's work and also wins continuously
 yahi kaaran he uttar bharat ke maidani ilaakon se lekar purvi bharat-purvottar or south ke chunaavon main bhi party ke chunavi bannron par piem modi kii tasviren hi pramukhataa se dikhti hai
 The opposition targets Modi every time by making Modi an issue, but Modi takes advantage of this and wins public confidence
 4
 It is important to get down on the ground on your own and complete the work within the prescribed time limit for completion of any work
 piem modi chahen kitne bhi vyast kyon na hon
 
 routine ke kaam main apni upasthiti jarur rakhte hai
 For the cleanliness drive, where PM Modi himself planted a broom in the police station of Delhi, he took a shovel in his hands to clean the ghat of Kashi
 mathura main kooda chunakar mashin main use ricycle kar unhone logon ko bada sandesh diya
 When the Prime Minister himself landed in the cleanliness mission, the people of the country also got inspired by this and in view of this, the cleanliness movement became a mass movement
 ye piem modi kii kaaryastylee kaa hi parinaam tha
 5
 fitness kii misaalis umr main jab log aam jindagi main ritair hokar aaraam kii jindagi jeena chaahate hai, tab piem modi roj 14 ghante tak kaam karte hai
 They set a different example through frequent foreign visits, addresses, marathon meetings and enticing speeches
 khud hi nahin, piem modi ne fitness ko desh ke har aadmi kaa mishan banavaa diya
 By organizing Yoga Day worldwide and then launching the Fit India Movement, PM Modi exercised in public and made people aware of fitness
 6
 PM Modi is very fond of modern technologies
 ve soshal media kaa istemaal logon se jude rahane ke liye karte hai
 They communicate directly with people through the Namo app
 tamaam mantriyon, vibhaagon ke adhikariyon ko bhi unhone takanic ke jariye logon ke sidhe sampark main rahane ko prerit kiya
 Through social media platforms like facebook-twitter and Instagram, and through his passion for technology, PM Modi remains in direct contact with the younger generation
 vipakshi dal jabatak soshal media ko samajhane main lage rahe, tabatak piem modi soshal media ke king ban chuke the
 7
 branding main maahiracentre kii chunavi jang main piem modi kii entry 2013 main hui tabase desh ke chunavi campan main bade badlaav dekhne ko mili
 By doing 3-D campaign, Mann Ki Baat on radio, discussion on tea, professional management of election campaign, big public meetings abroad, PM Modi not only transformed the party and himself into a brand but also changed the electoral picture of the country
 vipaksh ne jab chaukeedaar chor he kaa aarope lagaaya, tab piem modi ne usee kaa istemaal apane chunavi abhiyaan main kar liya or khud ko twitor par 'chaukeedaar narendra modi' bana liya
 Supporters also joined his campaign and he was defeated by the opposition's weapon
 8
 Staying adamant even in adverse circumstances, when in contrast to a common man getting hurt and hurt by criticism, on such occasions PM Modi comes forward to himself and sets an example
 pulavama hamale ke baad karrwai ke liye chaaron ore ke dabaav ke bich desh ko sambodhit karnaa or baad main airstrike se pakistan ko sabak sikhaanaa iskaa udhaaharan he
 During the disappointment of the Chandrayaan-2 mission, including addressing the country and creating an atmosphere of support for the scientific community, there were many occasions when PM Modi also set an example by handling the adverse situations differently
 9
 The emphasis on personal chemistry in foreign policy has been criticized by the Modi government's foreign policy, but in foreign policy also PM Modi has separated from the rest of the politicians and established personal chemistry with world leaders
 vaishvik netaaon ke saath unki dosti kii tasviren duniyabar main charchit huin
 His friendship with leaders like Barack Obama, Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping, Benjamin Netanyahu, Shinzo Abe, Emmanuel Macron gives India a distinct identity in the world
 iske alaava nepal-bhutan-bangladesh, afghanistan, iran, maldive jaise padosi deshon ke saath rishte majboot karne ke liye li se hatakar kootnithik rishte kaayam kiye
 The result of PM Modi's out-of-the-box foreign policy is that India has been successful in isolating Pakistan in the world
 10
 Presenting fashion trends PM Modi is also very aware of fashion
 unka style sabhi umr ke logon ke liye jald hi fishan ban jaataa he
 On the Red Fort, different colors of safes, colorful sadries, Modi kurtas, Modi swag, whatever PM Modi adopted, became a trend among the people
 piem modi kaa aadhi baaju kaa kurta aaj yuvaaon ke liye bhi style statement ban gaya he or fishan sho room kii shobhaa ban gaya he
 Modi jackets also trended among foreign leaders on several occasions
 2016 main bricks summit main roosi raashtrapati vladimir putin, chini raashtrapati shi jinping, brazil ke raashtrapati micel temer or jaikab juma dinar ke dauraan modi jacket main najar aae the
 Similarly, some special kurtas were gifted by PM Modi to South Korea's President Moon Jae-in, whom he had arrived wearing his office and shared his picture
 haalanki, apane kai tarah ke kurte, jacket ko lekar kai baar pradhanmantri modi vipakshi netaaon ke nishane par bhi aate rahe hai
 Including the slogan of the government of Suitboot given by Rahul Gandhi
 piem modi jahaan bhi jate hai logon se milane, unke saath vyavhaar or personal chemistry or jameen par khud utarkar apane kaam se logon ko na sirf apana mureed bana dete hai balki unhen apane mishan se bhi jod dete hai

 input - ieenes All the countries of the world are fighting the war against malaria
 isse puure vishwa main har saal lakhon log marate hai
 This disease is caused by the bite of the female anaphylase mosquito
 jaane, malaria kya he, kaise hota he, iske lakshan or isse judi anya vishesh jaankariyaan jo aapako shaayad pataa na hon
 Know basic information about malaria
 Malaria is spread by the bite of the female mosquito anaphylase
 is machhar main plasmodium naam kaa paraseete (protojoa) paaya jaataa he jiske kaaran machhar ke kaatane se ye rakt main kai guna badhata he or phir insaan ke sharir ko biimaar kar detaa he
 a person suffering from this disease has symptoms ranging from fever, tremors, sweating, severe headache, nausea, vomiting and vomiting with body breakdown
 isamen rogi ko baar-baar bukhaar aata he
 But despite these symptoms, it is very important for the patient to detect protozoa
 maadaa anopheles main sirf ek nahin balki kareeb aath tarah ke protojoa hote hai
 These are the main parasites (protozoa) that are caused by Malariaplasmodium falciparum (P
 Falciparum): ye paraseete behad khatarnaak bukhaar ke lakshan detaa he, bukhaar itnaa khatarnaak hota he ki kai baar marij kii isse mrityu kaa khatra bhi bana rahata he
 Sometimes, the patient experiences unconscionability
 wo kya bol rahaa he, ye bhi use pataa nahin chalata
 Due to this, there is very cold and headache and vomiting also occur

 Then in the year 1880, the first study of malaria was done by Charles Louis Alphonse Laverine Scientist

 The businessman in Delhi has been worried about sealing for several days
 aise main unke virodh main pichley ek hafton main se aam aadmi party vaali dilli sarkaar ne saath dene kii koshish kii he
 Even during the Delhi bandh of businessmen, hundreds of ministers, including ministers, continue to show that the real sympathies of the businessmen of Delhi are the same
 haalanki kyaam aadmi partika kaarobaariyon ke saath ye hamadardi vaala kandhaa kisi kaam kaa bhi he yaa phir ye sirf ek siyaasi kandhaa he? jiskaa istemaal siyaasi phayda uthaane ke liye kiya ja rahaa he
 The seven-million businessmen-traders of Delhi, who are hanging on their necks with the sword named, are responsible for the MCD, the Center and the Delhi government
 dilli sarkaar sirf in donon ko doshi tehraakar pallaa nahin jhaad sakati
 There are 351 roads in Delhi where sealing is taking place and these roads have to be notified to the Delhi government
 dilli sarkaar ne abhi tak wo prastaav hi nahin banaaya he jise centre sarkaar ke paas bheja ja sake
 Yes, the Aam Aadmi Party is targeting the opponents with a gun on the shoulders of businessmen
 ceiling par aage kya ho saktaa hacendre sarkaar chaahe to adhyadesh laa sakati he
 The Supreme Court can ask for time through this ordinance
 jaankaron kii maane to ye centre sarkaar ke liye aasaan nahin he
 If the central government does so, then the Supreme Court can not only refuse it, but it can also be asked why it was excluded when the Master Plan 2021 was made

 Chapter 15 of Master Plan 2021 says that if the conversion charge is given on the professional activity occurring in the basement, then there cannot be sealing
 is daayre main sie, doctor or vakil jaise profeshnal aate hai, lekin emsidi ne pehle to basament main tarah tarah ke kaarobaar ko jamane diya
 Now despite giving a conversion charge, the sealing work is also being done there
 asal main dilli isi ceiling kii maar ko kareeb 13 saal pehle bhi jhel chuki he
 Even in 2005, sealing in Delhi shook businessmen
 yahaan dilli ke 7 lakh kaarobaariyon ko ye bataanaa bhi jaruri he ki ek dashak pehle aakhir kaise ceiling se unhen nijaat mili thi

 yah film prakaash jha production main bani he
 Always highlighting social issues, Prakash Jha turned to comedy for the first time, with a message that today's children love their wealth, not love and respect for parents idia yaa vishay acha tha, magar yah sirf paper tak hi rah gaya
 This story looked very weak on screen
 har chiz ko jabardastee khinchaa gaya he
 The outlandish character and his outlandish actions were cast meaninglessly
 kabhi film main samalangik sambandh aa jaataa he to kabhi ghar kaa damaad aurat ke kapade pahanakar apana gussa nikaalata he
 That means four children of the Berry family and four of the four spoiled

 Yes, the actors of the film have a good performance, they have lived up to the work assigned to them

 These three now want to sow the seeds of 'jungle Raj 2' which Bihar will never accept

 Officials in Delhi had said that the CBI did not accept Kumar's demand regarding videography of the interrogation

 There were reports quoting Kumar's lawyers that at the request of the Commissioner of Police, the CBI was videographing his interrogation

 a few days later the STF office received a confidential letter from Ashok Dev Chaudhary, residing at Shukantnagar in Salt Lake City, Kolkata, which contained information about the paper leak in the LT grade teacher recruitment examination

" ÓÓ ashok upipiessi ke prashnptr chhapane vaale kolkata ke sicurity printig press ke maalik kowshik kumaar kaa najdiki banakar solver gang kii 'modes oprendi' samajhane laga
 Ashok gave the STF complete details of the candidates who had purchased the Social Science and Hindi question papers of LT grade examination
 estf ne upipiessi ke pariksha niyantrak anju katiyaar or sicurity printing press ke maalik kowshik kumaar par kadi nigaraanee shuru kar di
 Meanwhile, STF got information from Ashok that Kaushik is in Varanasi for leaking UPPCS new competitive exam papers
 estf ne 27 may ko kowshik ko varanasi se giraftaar kiya or usase pisies-2018 kii mukhya pariksha ke prashnptr baraamad kiye
 Curtain was removed from the UPPSC racket in strict questioning of Kaushik (see graphics)
 estf ko puure maamle main upipiessi kii pariksha niyantrak anju lata katiyaar kii mileebhagat kii jaankaree mili
 As soon as Anju Lata was arrested on May 30, there was a stir among the candidates preparing for competitive examinations
 unka hujum prayagraj main rajya lok seva ayog ke karyaalay ke baahar jutane laga
 a round of picketing started
 gussaye abhyarthiyon ne ayog ke mukhya get par kabja kar us par 'chilam seva ayog' likh diya
 The Yogi Adityanath government of the state came into the limelight by the revelation of the paper-out business and handed it over to the Special Investigation Team (SIT)

 The future of new competitive exams to be held in the next few months hangs in the balance

 The printing press operator, with complete secrecy, prints the question paper in that sealed envelope and submits it to the commission
 alti grad shikshak bhartee pariksha main paper li kiye jane kii jaankaree estf ne janvari main lok seva ayog kii pariksha niyantrak anju lata ko di thi
 STF had also asked not to declare the result of the teacher recruitment examination, despite its exam controller started declaring the exam results from March
 isse pariksha niyantrak bhi andeh ke ghere main aa gayi
 Anju Lata, who held the post of Controller of Examinations of the State Public Service Commission two years ago, came into the limelight in 2002 for topping the PACS examination of the Commission
 anju kii tainaati ke dauraan lok seva ayog ne kul paanch parikshaayen sanchalit kin or ye sabhi ab jaanch ke daayre main hai

 It was during Pandey's tenure that Anju Lata topped the PCS exam

 "why the commission gave the task of preparing exam papers in a centralized manner to a single man should be investigated," says Pandey
 isi ne bhrashtachar kii neenv rakhi he
 Before the PCS-2015 examination, the packaging of the papers was done in the Commission itself
 pisies-2015 kii praarambhik pariksha ke ek prashnptr ke lakhanu ke ek pariksha centre se out hone ke baad ayog ne vyavastha main badlaav kiya
 Now the packaging of question papers was also started in the printing press
 pro
 "the system of packaging the papers in private and irresponsible hands made it easy to paper out," says Pandey
 ''kadam-kadam par gadabadipichhali sapa sarkaar main huin ayog kii ek darjan se adhik bhartee parikshaayen sibiai jaanch kaa saamana kar rahi hai
 The Commission has taken steps like implementing the pattern of Union Public Service Commission in its examinations in the name of image improvement, minus marking in PCS (J) Preliminary Examination, keeping the process of formation of Interview Board confidential

 The proposed PCS-2018 main examination from June 17 may have been postponed due to the flaws in the LT Grade Teacher Recruitment Examination, but there was controversy
 ayog pehali baar is mukhya pariksha ko badale pattern par yojit karne ja rahaa tha
 Vinod Pandey, who is preparing for the competitive exams, says, "the demand of the candidates was that this time also the Commission will release the model paper of the examination to be done on the changed pattern this time
 ayog ne jaan-boojhkar aisa nahin kiya taaki mukhya pariksha ke prashnpatron ko out karne kii zyada keemat vasuuli ja sake
 During the arrest of Kaushik, the printing press owner, the question papers of the main examination of PCS-2018 were recovered from him
 isse abhyarthiyon ke aaropon ko bal mila he
 The Commission's examination committee is also under questions
 'pratiyogi chaatr sangharsh samiti' ke media prabharee avanish pandeya kehete hai, ''alti grad shikshak bhartee pariksha main ayog kii pariksha samiti kii kya bhoomika thi? isaki bhi jaanch honi chahie

" aavedan patron kii scrootni se lekar parikshaon kaa nateeja nikaalane kaa jimmaa sahaayak samiksha adhikariyon ke jimme hi he
 For this, a total of 127 posts of Assistant Review Officers have been approved in the Commission, but only 25 are working in them
 ayog main samiksha adhikari ke kul 152 pad hai, jinamein 50 khaali chal rahe hai
 Arvind Mishra, review officer working at UPPSC, says, "the biggest hurdle in filling the vacant posts of Assistant Review Officers is the ability of candidates to have 'O Level Computer Certificate'
 yah ek kathin computer course he
 The person who does 'O Level Computer Course' usually does not apply for the post of Assistant Review Officer
 isiilie ayog ke khaali pad bhar nahin paa rahe hai
 The final result of PCS (J) has not been announced in May despite the Supreme Court order due to lack of staff and officers

 Dinesh Kumar, president of the UP Public Service Commission officers-employees Union, says, "the STF has arrested the Comptroller of Examination without any evidence

 Even the STF has no evidence of leakage of LT Grade Teacher Recruitment Examination paper

 They are resorting to such things, this proves that they have nothing to show in terms of development
 meri sarkaar ke kaamon se isaki tulana kiijie
 Beef is not the issue in Bihar
 is par yahaan 1955 se hi roak lagi hui he
 The BJP wants to import the issue, a move taken out of desperation in an attempt to polarize voters
 dadri to nindaneey he hi, takaraav kaa maahaul banane ke liye isko ubhaara ja rahaa he
 They will not succeed
 yah chunaav ek nijee muqabla ban gaya he, aapke or pradhanmantri ke bich

 As far as i am concerned, it will not matter much

 This also shows that the state BJP has no one to compete with me, here the Prime Minister himself is contesting elections
 unke paas aisa koi nahin he jise project kiya ja saktaa he
 People have to decide whether they want a Bihari or an outsider to lead the state

 pradhanmantri ne vikaas ke liye vishaal package kaa elaan kiya he, kya isse unka palada baari ho saktaa he?nahin, aisa nahin hoga
 Because there is nothing new in this
 unhone ise sirf ripacage kiya he

 (input bhashaa se) (from input language) aam chunaav se pehle kya desh main bijepi kii lahar he? agar aap tivi channelon ko dekhen, to yah har nae din ek vyakti ko nirnaayak or karishmai vyaktitv ke rup main dikhaata he, jiske paas desh ko bhrashtachar se mukt karne or arthvyavastha ko nai oonchai par le jane kaa nakshaa taiyaar he
 But is this true or is it a media-generated boast to make a person an antelope, which, despite being declared untainted by the Supreme Court, will have to carry the scandal of the 2002 Gujarat riots
 16 may ko hi yah tay hoga ki narendra modi pradhanmantri banenge yaa nahin
 But what is bothering people right now is the glorification of Modi by the media or some part of the electronic media
 isamen koi shaq nahin ki modi ek nirnaayak or kushal netaa ke rup main saamne aae hai jo desh ke aarthik paridrishy ko badal saktaa he, jaisaa ki vah khud hindutv kii apeksha vikaas par dhyaan die jane kii jarurat par bal dete hai
 But it is also a hidden fact that Modi is working to build his image among the public to eradicate the stain of the 2002 riots, because he knows that the road to the Seven Race Course Road will not be so easy? Brand Modi is a creation of new and old media
 soshal media par modi ek brands hai
 He has over 3
5 million followers on Twitter, while 1 on Facebook
 1 karod prashansak hai
 But this is old news
 modi kaa media kis tarah prachaar kar rahi he
 The only danger in the way of Modi becoming PM is the new party Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)
 congress jahaan duubataa jahaaj lag rahi he or iske kai varisht netaa raajnneeti kaa swaad nahin chakhnaa chaahate, na hi teesraa morcha main koi majboot netaa najar aayaa he
 AAP is the only threat to the BJP and the media is rightly or wrongly denigrating its founder Arvind Kejriwal
 yah mana hua tathy he ki media ek mahatvapurn hathiyaar he jo janata ke man ko badal sakati he, lekin kya sirf ek netaa ke paksh main baat karnaa uchit he?kejariwal kii us baat se sahamat nahin hua ja saktaa jisamen unhone modi kaa prachaar karne ke liye media ko jail bhejne kii baat kahi thi, lekin unhone media kii praasangikta par sawaal uthaaya he ki kya media praasangik he?is sawaal kaa jawaab sirf media hi de sakati he or yah kathin hoga
 But the media, especially the television channels, do not feel that the daily attack on Kejriwal can affect its credibility
 kya media bijepi kii aguwai vaale endie dwaara 2004 main chalaae gaye india shining prachaar ko bhul gai? puraa abhiyaan bijepi par baari pad gaya or congress kii aguwai vaali upie kii sarkaar satta main ai thi
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Japanese tweets were a huge hit and were discussed in India and abroad
 lekin sawaal yah uthaa ki kya piem modi japani sikh gaye hai yaa kisi or ne unke naam se ye twit kiye
 Now the economic paper 'the Economic Times' has written that behind them is Hiren Joshi who looks at the accounts of PM Modi's blog, Twitter, website and Facebook
 44 varshiya joshi ne japan main bhartiya duutavas kii madad se aath twit japani main karwaae
 The PMO wrote this tweet in English and sent it to the Indian Embassy in Japan
 unase kaha gaya ki piem modi unhen japani piem shinjo abe ko bhejnaa chaahate hai or isliye unka japani bhashaa main anuwaad kiya jaae
 The embassy sent the Japanese translation here which was examined by an interpreter of the Ministry of External Affairs
 uske baad use ek anya software kii madad se phir se jaancha gaya or tab jaakar use twitor par post kiya gaya
 These tweets were sent from Modi's personal account and not from the PMO

 - Input PTI america ne is bare main kuch kehane se inkaar kar diya he ki kya bharat ko bhi mumbai hamale ke sajeeshkartaaon ke khilaaf pakistan main karrwai karne ke liye america jitna adhikaar he
 At the same time, the US described the killing of Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden as "absolutely unique"
 videsh vibhaag ke pravaktaa mark toner se jab samvaadadaataaon ne poocha ki yadi bharat mumbai hamale ke doshiyon ke khilaaf pakistan main isi tarah kii karrwai karata he to kya america uskaa samarthan karegaa, is par toner ne kaha, "main aise abhiyaan ke bare main itani dur tak kii baaten nahin karnaa chahta, jo america or duniya ke itihaas main bilkul anokhaa ho
 "toner said," here was a man who was probably the most wanted man in the world and he committed heinous crimes not only against American citizens but against people all over the world
 " toner ne kaha, "main yahaan koi lambaa-chaudaa chitra nahin kheenchna chahta
 What we have said in this context is that it was a man against whom we had the intelligence to take action
 hamane us par isliye karrwai kii kyonki ham maanate hai ki vah america ke liye pratyaksh or asann khatra tha
 "on being reminded of the presence in Pakistan of those responsible for the attack on the Indian Parliament and the killing of hundreds of people in Mumbai, Toner said he was aware of all those cases
" toner ne kaha, "bharat va pakistan donon ke saath hamaara aatankwaad nirodhi sahyog jari he or ham maanate hai ki yah sahyog vastav main isi tarah ke tatwon ke khilaaf kendrit he
 "but Toner made it clear that even though Islamabad has warned, the US will take similar action again if needed
 gyaat ho ki islamabad ne dhamkee di he ki yadi pakistan kii samprabhutaa kaa dobaaraa ulanghan kiya gaya to vah america ke saath sainya khufia sahyog par punarvichaar karne ko majaboor hoga
 Toner said, "all i can say is that our stand on this has been very clear
 ham maanate hai ki yah vyakti america or america nagarikon ke liye pratyaksh khatra tha, or duniya ke liye bhi
 And when we had intelligence to take action, we took action
 " Imran Khan is set to become PM in Pakistan
 paak chunaav ke nateezon par bharatiyon kii bhi nazren lagi hui thim
 Many Indians feel that there may be some improvement in indo-pak relations with the arrival of Imran, who talks of creating a 'new Pakistan'
 lekin khud pakistan ke kai export maan rahe hai ki imran ke saath aane se bharat ke saath pakistan ke rishton main or bigaad hi hone kii ashanka he
 In fact, in his speeches during the election campaign, Imran has adopted an anti-india attitude many times
 chunaav prachaar ke dauraan imran khan jaanboojh kar bhartiya media se dur rahe or khud ko saport na karne ke aarope par unhone antarrashtriya media kii bhi aalochana kii
 In this way, the victory of Imran Khan can have a huge impact on the relationship between Pakistan and India
 unhone apane virdohi navaj sharif parivaar par aarope lagaaya tha ki unka parivaar ek aise 'international agenda' kaa hissaa he jo pakistan ke khilaaf kaam karata he
 He said that, 'nawaz Sharif is the agent of an international agenda, which aims to discredit Pakistan
 'unhone aarope lagaaya tha ki 'modi ke prati naram ravaiya' apana kar navaj sharif apane kaarobaari hiton ko aage badhaane ke liye kaam kar rahe the
 Regarding Kashmir, he has consistently said that the Indian power establishment will stop Kohima and should bring a resolution in the UN Security Council
 pakistan ke kai paryvekshak yah maanate hai ki imran ke piem banane se bharat or pakistan ke rishte or bigadenge
 He has been alleging during the election campaign that India has been supporting Nawaz Sharif and is the main conspirator against Pakistan
 aisa mana ja rahaa he ki imran khan bhavishya mempakistani senake ishaare par hi kaam karenge or iskaa matlab yah he ki paak-bharat ke rishte main koi sudhaar nahin hoga
 Anyway, by making many accusations on India, Imran Khan has made the path of improving relations a little difficult
 imran khan ke prachaar yaa menifesto main agar kashmir yaa bharat kii niti ke bare main kuch khaas nahin tha, to ise bhi jaankaar is baat kaa sanket maan rahe hai ki vah bharat niti ko sena or iesai ke mutabik hi rakhana chaahate hai

 But he did talk about such scenes shown in films
 jaankaree ke liye bataa den film veere di wedding main swara bhaskar par orgajam seen filmaaya gaya he jisamen actress ko 'wibrator' kaa istemaal karte dikhaaya gaya he
 While some people are praising Swara for this bold scene, some people have described it as cheap and vulgar
 kyon baar-baar trol hoti hai swara bhaskar? sonam kapur ne batayajeenyu main tish skool of arts main piechdi kar chukin or film itihaashkar ira bhaskar ne ek website se swara ke bold seen ko lekar baat kii
 He said, 'first of all i would like to say that sexuality is not a subject of Indian cinema, which can be presented directly
 agar ham indian cinema ke itihaas kii baat karen to hamaara cinema kaaphi alag he, isamen pichley kai saalon se vikaas hua he or irotic subject par bhi hamaara najariya behad saaf or milajula he
 He said - 'songs have been used to show sexuality or women's desire, but there are many things that cannot be shot directly in the songs
 phir chaahe wo hindi filmein hon, tamil filmein ho yaa bengali filmein
 Although to a large extent, the songs of the films have been shown to have erotic and saxiality emotions
 'ira bharaskar ne film 'mughal-e-ajam' ke gane kaa udhaaharan dete hue kaha, "ye film sidhe taur par lav mekking yaa sexual act ko nahin dikhaati he
 "ira here reminded Mahesh Bhatt's statement to 'mughal-e-azam'
 jisamen mahesh ne 'mughal-e-ajam' ke us seqvence ko hindi cinema kaa sabase irotic sikvence bataaya tha jisamen dilip kumaar madhubala ke chehre par haath pherate hai
 'ira said about the trolling of women' s active active characters, this is happening because women in such films are introduced realistically and it will take time to adopt society
 aatanki sanghathan hijbul mujahidin ke chif saiyad salahuddin ko america ne antarrashtriya aatanki ghoshit kar diya he
 Security experts say that this will not have any effect on terrorist activities in Jammu and Kashmir but pressure on Pakistan will definitely increase
 udhar pakistan ne salahuddin kaa naam liye bagaiyr kaha he ki kashmiriyon ke haq ke liye ladane waalon ko aatanki nahin kaha ja saktaa he
 Salahuddin is the perpetrator of hundreds of terrorist incidents in Jammu and Kashmir
 barason se aatank kaa khel khel rahe is shaks ne hizbul mujahidin ko khadaa kiya
 But now after so many years, America has given its message by declaring Salahuddin as an international terrorist just before the meeting of Prime Minister and Trump
 isse khaas phayda to nahin hoga lekin yah sankethik kahin zyada he
 Union Home Secretary Rajiv Maharishi said that this is a very good thing
 isse uske movement or funding par roak lagegi
 By the way, he is a sneaky man who runs away
 haalanki jaankaron kaa kahana he ki salahuddin ko aatanki ghoshit kiye jane se jammu-kashmir main bahut fark nahin aayega
 The reason for this is that while taking action in Kashmir, the terrorists do not take orders directly from Salahuddin, but instead take orders from their district commander and execute the action
 tippaniyan Union Minister of State for Home Hansraj Ahir told NDTV India that this would increase pressure on Pakistan
 wo jhukegaa or duniya ke saamne benakaab hoga ki abhi bhi aatank ke kaarkaane chalaa rahaa he
 On the other hand, Pakistan has come to the rescue of Salahuddin
 paak videsh mantralay ne bayaan jari kar kaha he ki kashmiriyon ke haq main ladane waalon ko aatanki nahin kaha ja saktaa
 Hafiz Saeed and Zakiurrahman Lakhvi were also among the international terrorists before Salahuddin
 isliye salahuddin ke bhi aisi list main aa jane se jamini halaat bhale na badalen, magar pakistan par dabaav badhegaa or shaayad salahuddin kii awajahi or paise jutaney par asar padegaa
 On the other hand, Pakistan has said without consulting Salahuddin that those fighting for the rights of Kashmiris cannot be called terrorists
 vaise salahuddin jammu-kashmir main saikadon aatanki vaardaaton kaa mujrim he
 For years, this person playing the game of terror raised the Hizbul Mujahideen
 lekin ab itane baras baad america ne thik pradhanmantri or trump kii mulaakaat se pehle salahuddin ko antarrashtriya aatanki ghoshit kar apana sandesh de diya he
 It will not be of much benefit, but it is more than indicative
 kendriya grih sachiv rajeev maharishi ne kaha ki ye bahut acchhee baat he
 This will prevent its movement and funding
 vaise vah darpok aadmi he jo bhaaga phirata he
 However, experts say that the declaration of Salahuddin as a terrorist will not make much difference in Jammu and Kashmir
 isaki vajah yah he ki amunan kashmir main karrwai karte vakt aatanki salahuddin se sidhe aadesh nahin lete hai balki apane jila commander se aadesh lekar karrwai ko anjaam dete hai
 The comments kendriya grih rajyamantri hansraj ahir ne enditivi india se kaha ki isse pakistan par dawaab badhegaa
 He will bow down and expose to the world that he is still running the factory of terror
 udhar pakistan salahuddin ke bachaav main utar aayaa he
 The Pakistan Foreign Ministry has issued a statement saying that those fighting for the rights of Kashmiris cannot be called terrorists
 salahuddin ke pehle hafiz said or zakiurrahman lakhvi bhi antarrashtriya aatankwaadiyon main hai
 So even if Salahuddin is included in such a list, the ground situation may not change, but the pressure on Pakistan will increase and it will probably affect Salahuddin's movement and money

 saamaajik kaaryakarta anna hajaare ne bhrashtachar ke khilaaf har hindustani ke dil main jo ummid kii 'lau' jalaai he uske prajjwalit hone kaa abhas kam se kam mujhe to india get or tihaad jail kaa najaara dekhne ke baad to ho hi gaya
 Children, old, young people, students were all full of enthusiasm in this festival of democracy
 alam yah tha ki koi yah nahin dekh rahaa tha ki doosraa kya kar rahaa he, chaar-paanch ke samooh main log apni hi dhun main deshbhakti ke taraane ga rahe the
 Outside the jail, some people had been sitting on the ground since Tuesday night, some had fallen asleep, but there was wax of molten candles in a place nearby, which was telling the story of the night
 tihaad jail ke baahar logon kaa hujum dekhne laayak tha, logon ke haanthon main tirangaa tha or ve lagaataar 'bhrashtachar band karo' or 'vandemaatram' ke naare laga rahe the
 It was written on a banner
 'jo anna nahin wo ganna he
 'people said that this enthusiasm is not just two-four days and we will continue to fight this battle with Anna Hazare till every Indian's purpose is reached
 isamen aise logon kii sankhya kaaphi adhik thi jo daftar se avkaash lekar yaa ghar kaa kaam-dhandha chhodkar anna hajaare kii is muhim main shaamil hone aae the
 Outside Tihar Jail met a woman who had brought food and water from the house and was distributing it among the people
 is mahila ne kaha, 'logon ko khaanaa de rahi hum
 Some people are refusing to eat because they say how can we eat as long as Anna Hazare is hungry
 ' tihaad ke baahar mahatma gandhi kii veshbhusha main khadey 21 varshiya sanjay sharma par sabhi kii nigahen thim
 i also could not stop myself
 barabas hi unke paas chalaa gaya baatcheet karne ke liye
 He told that he is a photographer
 unhone kaha ki jab unhone tihaad jane kii baat kii to parivaar ne unhen 'pagal' kaha lekin vah kisi kii parvaah nahin karte hue yahaan chale aae
 Sharma lives in a slum and is sad that nothing happens in the country for people like him
 unhone kaha, 'emele aate hai or vot mangakar chale jate hai
 Last year, i gave Rs 500 to get a voter ID card
 ' yah to tihaad jail ke baahar kaa najaara tha lekin shaam chaar baje ke kareeb india get kaa najaara dekhakar to main dang rah gaya
 The people present at India Gate were quite angry with the government, especially Union Human Resource Development Minister Kapil Sibal
 kuch jagahon par congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ke khilaaf bhi narebaaji ho rahi thi
 Nisha Razdan, who came with her entire family from Gurgaon, said, 'people have left their homes here because they have been caught by corruption
 pani sar ke upar se bah rahaa he
 There is no one here to listen to us
 har vibhaag main log bike hue hai
 There is no work without paying
 chaparasi se lekar afasar tak sabhi paise khate hai
 These people have caused so much trouble that now the tolerance limit is over
 'india get or tihaad jail par din bitaane ke baad main shaam ko jab ghar pahunchaa to kaaphi thakaa hua tha
 a lot of things were going on in the mind
 ek dar yah bhi ki kya anna hajaare kaa andolan apane anjaam tak pahonchega
 Then suddenly Lalu ji appeared on TV
 ek samachar channel par sansad kii kaarywahi kii kuch jhalak dikhaai ja rahi thi
 Lalu ji said, 'I respect Anna Hazare a lot
 achche aadmi hai
 Bapu and Jayprakash are following Narayan's path but i want to say in Parliament that no one can replace Bapu, JP and Acharya Narendra Dev in the country
 haa, aap unki nakal jarur kar sakate hai
 There is no doubt in Lalu ji that Anna Hazare may not get the place that 'bapu' and 'JP' got in the country, but does he realize that he has compared Anna Hazare to Gandhi and JP Why was there such a need to say such a thing? Can Lalu ji explain why people are calling Anna Hazare as the 'second Gandhi of the country' despite all the political personalities in the country
 kya vah aaj kisi ek aise netaa kaa naam bataa sakate hai, jiske kehane par puraa desh is tarah sadakon par utar aae
 Perhaps Lalu ji will not have the answer
 aaj ke netaaon ko aatmachintan or aatmamanthan karne kii aavashyaktaa he nahin to meri tarah shaayad desh kaa har yuva yahi kahegaa
 Sorry Lalu ji, our Gandhi and JP are Anna Hazare
 bhagalpur srijan ghotaale main sabase zyada sarkari rupee kaa bandarbaant bhoomi adhigrahan ke maamle main hua he
 The way the creation was made by the government to compensate the farmers from their account, this can be found in the acquisition of land for the power plant being built in Pirpainti, Bhagalpur
 yahaan kisaanon ko muaavje kaa paisa sarkaar ne nahin balki srijan naamak sanstha ne diya or wo bhi puraa nahin diya
 Farmers did not get compensation The Government of Bihar had to get land for the power plant in 2013-15 in Pirpanti of Bhagalpur
 lagbhag 500 acre jameen kaa adhigrahan karnaa he, lekin abhi tak keval 60 fisadi jameen kaa adhigrahan ho paaya he
 It is said that the entire land could not be acquired due to creation
 lekin abhi tak jitani jameen kaa adhigrahan sarkaar ne kiya he, uskaa puraa paisa bhi kisaanon ko nahin mila he
 The farmers got money from the creation account, some farmers owe Rs 30–30 crore
 kuch kisaanon ko sarkaar ke khate se nahin balki srijan ke khate se paisa mila he, jabaki niyamon ke mutabik sarkaar ke dwaara adhigrahit kii gai jameen kaa paisa sarkaar detii he, par yahaan srijan ke khate se kisaanon tak paisa pahunchaa
 The Sarjan Mahila Vikas Samiti, along with the Land Acquisition Department, also defrauded the farmers
 nahin mila puraa muaavja'aaj tak' kii mulaakaat esake rajjak naam ke pirpanti ke kisaan se hui
 Whose land has been acquired by the government for the power plant
 badale main jo muaavja mila he, wo sarkaar ke khate se nahin balki srijan ke khate se mila
 Razzaq has three sons, all three were to get 60-60 lakhs in the first installment, 19–19 lakhs in the second installment, but two brothers got compensation and the third one is yet to get compensation
 aadhe kisaanon ko hi mila muaavjabhagalpur pirpanti main power plant ke liye sarkaar ke dwaara 840 kisaanon kii jameen kaa adhigrahan kiya gaya, lekin kisaanon ko muaavje kaa bhugtan sarkaar ke khate se nahin balki srijan ke khate se kiya gaya
 So far only fifty percent farmers have been given compensation, that too 70 to 80 percent amount has been given
 blank check par sin karayaek kisaan munna singh hai, jinaki kahani to or chaunkaane vaali he
 He said that a blank check was signed and the then land officer Rajiv Ranjan told him that the money was not in the government's account
 jab aayega to aapako mil jayega
 The government should give money in exchange for land acquisition, but on the contrary, the check was taken from the farmer
 inkaa do karod rupaya bakaayaa he
 Dileep Mishra, who is agitating for the compensation of land to farmers, is absconding
 Most of the farmers here have been paid half-incomplete from the creation account
 bhu arjan adhikari rajeev ranjan pichley kai varshon se bhagalpur main hi tainaat the
 At present, he is booked in this scam and he is absconding
 lekin itnaa tay he ki rajeev ranjan ko is maamle kii puri jaankaree he kyonki ghotaale kaa khulaasa bhi bhu arjan vibhaag ke check bouns se hi pataa chalaa
 Where has the compensation amount of the farmers gone? The farmers are shocked and disturbed seeing this feat of creation
 kisaanon kaa kahana he kisrijanane bhu arjan padaadhikariyon ke saath milakar is ghotaale ko anjaam diya he
 Even after five years of land acquisition, many farmers have not yet received compensation
 kisaanon ke paise ko srijan ne apane nijee vyapaar main laga diya he
 The farmers also say that the land acquisition department used to take the sign on plain paper and said that the compensation amount will reach your account
 chaar maheene baad kuch kisaanon ke khate main rupee aae, lekin puure paise nahin mili
 At the same time, even after five years of land acquisition, some farmers' money has not yet come
 pichley do maichon main jabardast aakraamakata kii baangi pesh karne vaali bhartiya hockey team vishwa champion austrailia ke saamne puri tarah dabi sahami najar ai or nihaayat hi ekatarfa mukaable main 0-8 se sharmnaak paraajay kaa saamana karne ke baad use rashtramandal khelon main rajat padak se hi santosh karnaa padaa
 This is one of India's most embarrassing defeats
 rashtramandal khelon ke itihaas main purush haaki spardhaa main bharat kaa yah pehla padak he
 After the induction of hockey in these games in 1998, India finished fourth, while it did not participate in Manchester (2002) and finished fifth in Melbourne (2006)
 duusari ore rik charlsworth kii austrailian team ne rashtramandal khelon main lagaataar chauthaa swarna padak jitkar vishwa hockey main apni badshahath par phir muhar laga di
 In a single year, it became the first team to win a gold medal in the World Cup, Champions Trophy and Commonwealth Games
 austrailia ke liye jasana nilsan (17waan or 28waan minute), kris sirialo (20waan), luk dornar (34waan or 51waan minute),simon orchard (60waan) or jaimi dwayer (67waan minute) or glen turnar (70waan) ne gol kiye
 The Australian team, who had played an aggressive game from the very first minute, consistently attacked the Indian goal
 vahiin pradhanmantri manmohan singh samet kai vishisht atithiyon kii maujuudagi main khel rahi bhartiya team vah josh, junun or aakraamakata nahin dikhaa saki jo usne pakistan or england ke khilaaf dikhaai thi
 The huge number of spectators gathered at Dhyanchand Stadium for Rajpal Singh's encouragement was disappointed
 iske saath hi unhen 1982 asian khelon kii yaaden taaja ho gai jab final main isi maidan par bharat ko 7-1 se paraajay kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha lekin tab saamne pakistani team thi
 This is India's third consecutive defeat at the hands of Australia at this ground
 isse pehle farvari march main hue vishwa cap main pool charan main austrailia ne use 5-2 ke antar se haraaya
 The same story was repeated in the pool phase in these games as well
 austrailia ke liye paanchaven minute main nilsan ko gol karne kaa sunaharaa mauka mila lekin unka shot baahar kii ore nikal gaya
 India got their first penalty corner in the 15th minute on which Sarwanjeet's push could not trap the Indian drag flicker
 iske do minute baad austrailia ne bhartiya gol par hamalaa bolaa
 Within D, the ball hit the Indian defender Sandeep Singh's stick and on deflection Nielsen put it inside the goal
 austrailian team lagaataar do penlti carnor mili
 The third penalty corner was easily converted into a goal by Ciriello
 nilsan ne 28wein minute main austrailia kii badhat tiguni kar di or bhartiya dephence ko puri tarah chhitar bitar karke aasaan gol daaga
 a minute before the break, Dorner converted a penalty corner to extend Australia to 4-0
 duusare hof main bhi austrailia ne bharatiyon ko dabaav se nikalne nahin diya
 Doran converted a penalty corner in the 51st minute for Australia
 bharat ko bhi 58wein minute main penlti carnor mila lekin sandip singh kaa shot kamjor rahaa
 Australia continued to rain goals even after this
 orchard ne 60wein minute main bhartiya dephence main send lagaakar austrailia ko chatha gol diya
 After this, Dwyer, playing his 250th international match, scored in the 67th minute
 aakhir second main turnar ne ek or gol karke austrailia kii 8-0 se jeet par muhar laga di

 Priya Prakash Warrier's film which made headlines overnight with her eye-popping viral video has finally been released
 tinej romance par bani is film main priya kaa role behad chota tha lekin internet par jabardast tareeke se viral hone ke saath hi film main unke role ko bhi ahm bana diya tha
 However, the story of this film based on teenage romance does not show the freshness that is usually expected from such romantic films
 oru adaar lav kahani he priya or roshan kii
 Roshan, who studies in class XI, takes heart upon seeing Priya and tries to find Priya like a traditional hero
 film main priya or roshan se zyada behatar nurin nazar ain hai
 This school romantic comedy based on love and attraction is a half-baked story whose characters seem far from reality
 film main zyaadaatar students kaa makasad ladakiyon ko rijhaane tak hi simit he
 However, Nurin's character seems somewhat sensitive
 wo ek rasookh parivaar se he jise unka parivaar kaaphi freedom bhi detaa he
 Nurin knows that the purpose of life is not just in romance with boys
 vahiin film main priya ek insikyor ladki kii bhoomika main nazar aati he
 Although the film's climax is quite different, but it does not feel comfortable
 prayogdharmita ke chakkar main film ke diarector ne ajeebogareeb prayog kiya he
 Fans had high hopes from this film since the film's trailer but Priya's film does not stand the test
 acting kii baat kii jaae to roshan or nurin ne apane exprations ke sahare film main jaan foonkane kii koshish kii he lekin kai baar ye donon kalakaar overacting karte bhi dikhte hai
 However Priya Prakash Warrier has given only limited expressions in the film and she still has a long way to go in the acting journey
 agar aap priya prakaash variyar se judi yaad ko bigaadna nahin chaahate hai to is film ko dekhne se batch sakate hai
 Students are now in support after a fight with students of African descent in Delhi
 emeti uniwarsity ke chaatro ne 'humons of emeti' naam se fasebuk pej banaaya he
 Last week, three African students were assaulted at the Rajiv Chowk metro station

 is dukhad paristhiti main ham uniwarsity prabandhan se baat karenge ki africa chaatro ke ilaaj ke liye rupee jutaney kaa koi rasta nikaalnaa chahie
 The three students of African descent were accused of molesting women, after which they were beaten up fiercely in the metro
 peedit africa chaatr ne bataaya ki metro main kuch log hamaari tasviren le rahe the
 When we opposed this, they started fighting with us

 lekin aakhri vakt par ve use short mid on kii ore khel paae
 Rayudu had reached the half-pitch to take a run, but Saurabh Tiwari delayed
 is bich umesh yadav ne safai se gend uthaate hue strikers chor kii gilliyaan bikher deen or saurabh dekhte hi rah gaye

 Everyone's desires are different, everyone's thinking is different
 jaahir he log chunaav main kin muddon par or kis party ko vot denge aise sawaalon kaa jawaab paanaa aasaan nahin
 But it is also true that now people have already made up their mind before the election and that is why Aaj tak-india today-mail today-org surveyed
 chaaron rajyon ke 15 fisadi vidhansabha kshetron main logon ke man ko tatola gaya he
 The survey was conducted from 18 March to 24 March
 tamilnadu or pashchim bengal main 4000 logon par kiya gaya ye opinian pole
 Whereas, 3000 people in Assam and Kerala were included in the survey
 survey main shahari or gramin donon ilaakon main baraabar-baraabar dhyaan diya gaya he
 The figures for the seats have been presented on the basis of the trends found in this sample
 anumaan he ki is rujhaan main teen fisadi kaa fark aa saktaa he
 West Bengal, the state where the honor of Left and Mamta is at stake
 opinian pole se jo rujhaan mili hai, uske mutabik is baar wo hoga, jo pichley 34 saal main nahin hua, opinian pole kahata he ki congress kii madad se vahaan mamata kii trinmul kii sarkaar banegi
 When the Aaj tak-india today-mail today-org opinion poll asked the people of West Bengal about their mood, they indicated that the color of the government there would change
 bengal main 294 siten hai or survey ke mutabik vahaan trinmul or congress ke gathbandhan ko 182 siten mil rahi hai
 The Left Front is getting only 101 seats and thus the tmc-congress alliance looks far ahead of the majority figure of 148
 pichley vidhansabha chunaav main tiemasi ko 33 or congress ko 26 siten mili thim, jabaki is baar donon ke gathbandhan ko siton kaa jabardast phayda hone kaa anumaan he
 In contrast, the Left Front, which had captured 236 seats in the last election, may have to suffer a huge loss of seats this time
 bengal ke logon se poocha gaya ki aap mukhyamantri ke rup main kise dekhnaa chaahate hai, to isapar sabase zyada 48
 6 per cent people took the name of Mamata Banerjee, while Buddhadeb Bhattacharya was liked by about 20 per cent
 rajya ke saadhe paanch fisadi log pranab mukherjee ko mukhyamantri bananaa chaahate hai
 After all, what will be the election issues in Bengal
 survey ke mutabik mahangaai ko 92
 6 per cent of people consider it to be the biggest issue, while less than 5 per cent say that inflation is not an issue
 isi tarah bhrashtachar ke sawaal par kareeb 84 fisadi logon ne kaha ki haa, ye ek mudda he, jabaki 11
 7 percent of the people did not appear to agree with this
 bijli, pani, sadak ko bengal ke 81 fisadi log chunavi mudda maanate hai, jabaki 16
 3 percent people do not agree with this
 isi tarah rajya ke 83
 2 per cent people have considered unemployment as the issue and 13 per cent said that no, unemployment is not an issue
 ab baat agar pashchim bengal main badalati hawa kii kii jaae, to voton kii fisadi main koi khaas badlaav nahin hoga
 In comparison to 2009, Mamta's party will lose one percent
 lekin siton ke anumaan main mamata to aage hi hai
 The survey asked people questions comparing Jyoti Basu and Buddhadeb Bhattacharya
 poocha gaya ki log kise behatar mukhyamantri ke rup main yaad rakhenge
 How do people see the work of Mamta Banerjee as railway minister, this was also a question in the survey
 survey main logon se poocha gaya ki agar mamata banerjee pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri banati hai to ve kisi mukhyamantri sabit hongi? kuch log ye kehete hue left kii nitiyon kii aalochana karte hai ki isi kii vajah se kolkata baaki metro shaharon kii tulana main pichad gaya he
 People were asked in the survey whether they agreed with it or not? Trinamool's opponents accuse him of colluding with Naxalites
 survey main poocha gaya ki ye baat tiemasi ko phayda pahunchaati he yaa phir use iskaa nuksaan hota he

 Abdul Bari Siddiqui, leader of the opposition party in the Bihar Legislative Assembly, alleged that the financial management of the state government enforcing the Financial Accountability and Financial Management (FRBM) Act was not right
 pehle rajya sarkaar ne 24 hajaar karod rupee kaa yojana aakaar nirdhaarit karaayaa or phir pratham tathaa dwitiya anupoorak maang se badhaakar 27365 karod rupaya karaayaa
 This amount for the current financial year is to be spent by 31 March 2012, but according to the data received till November 2011, the details show that the government had spent only Rs 10,000 crore till November
 siddiqui ne aarope lagaaya ki chaar maheene main rajya sarkaar ko ab shesh 17,365 karod rupee kharch karne he
 The state government is quick to approve the huge plan size, but so far only 30 per cent of the amount has been spent
 unhone kaha ki rajya sarkaar ke kathith vittiya prabandhan ke kaaran ab shesh bachi raashi ke laps hone kaa khatra mandara rahaa he
 Due to this, public money will be misused in all three circumstances

 rajya main rashtriya gramin swasthya mishan (enarechaem) main 1300 karod rupee main se keval 780 karod rupee hi kharch hue hai

 3 yani keji di6 block ke puure 7,645 vargkilometre kshetra ko company ke hawaale rahane diya
 Relais discovered gas in the region in 2001 in Dhirubhai 1 and Dhirubhai 3
 kaig kii raay main utpaadan main hissedari ke anubandh ke tahat gyaat tel gas ke strot vaale kshetron ko chhod reliance ko blaak kaa ek chauthai hissaa chhod dena chahie tha
 According to the report, according to the production participation contract, Reliance should leave 25 percent of the total area outside the oil or gas exploration area in June 2004 and 2005
 lekin yahaan sarkaar ne puure kshetra ko hi khoj kshetra kii manyata de kar company ko use apane kabje main rakhane kii chhot de di
 The CAG has told the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas in the report that it should review its decision to declare the entire area as an oil and gas exploration area, strictly following the terms of the PSC contract
 kaig ne kaha he ki mantralay ko tel khoj kshetra kaa naye sire se nirdhaaran kar shesh kshetra ko alag kar dena chaiye
 The CAG has also pulled up the government for ignoring the contracts and expensive procurement given by Reliance at higher rates
 isi pariprekshya main kaig ne reliance industries dwaara diye gayi 10 thekon kii gaharaai se chaanbin karne ko bhi kaha he
 Of this, eight contracts have been awarded to the anchor group
 in thekon ke liye akele isi samooh ne boli lagaai thi
 CAG has given some relief to Reliance in case of heavy expenditure in KG D6 area, saying that only approving the estimated cost of the project is not just accepting the cost of the project, after audit of the actual expenditure, its true picture came out Can come
 kaig ne kaha ki relaaysan ne dhirubhai 1 or dhirubhai 3 kshetra ke vikaas ke liye may 2004 main shuruaati vikaas yojana pesh kii thi jisamen 2
 Capital expenditure was estimated at $ 4 billion
 iske baad company ne oktober 2006 main pehle charan main 5
 2 billion dollars and 3 in the second phase
 6 arab dollars kaa atirikt puunji vyay hone kaa prastaav diya
 The report said, 'most of the purchases under the initial development plan were done at the last minute, while the purchase was started before the excess expenditure plan was submitted to the government, according to which it becomes clear
 That the operator of the area started development work not in accordance with the initial plan but according to the plan of increased expenditure later
 ’kaig report ke anusaar keji basin kshetra main 2006-07 or 2007-08 main huye kharch kii to lekhapariksha kar lee gai he lekin baaki 2008-09 main huye kharch kii lekhapariksha aane vaale samay main kiya jaayegaa
 The CAG gave anchor group 1 in the KG D6 field itself for the production facility of MA oil field on its own bid
 1 arab dollars kaa theka dene ko lekar reliance kii taraf bhaunhen tani hai
 The auditor has insisted on scrutinizing the 10 contracts awarded by Reliance
 inamen se aath theke ankar samooh kii companiyon ko diye gayi hai
 'we have been suggesting not only that the company operating in the area should adopt the government procurement process but also that any commercial recovery or acquisition should be aimed at increasing competitiveness so that good competitive price is included
 ’report main varsh 1999 main shuru kii gai nai tel khoj licencing niti (nelp) ke tahat piessi kii samiksha par bhi jor diya gaya he
 It said that in this policy prepared during the bjp-led NDA government, the contractors have not been given suitable incentives to reduce capital expenditure
 jabaki iske vipareet niti main shuruaati daur main adhik kharch ke liye thekedaaron ko protsaahit kiya gaya he
 As a result, the government receives less from the region
 report main kaha gaya he ‘do swatantra agenciyaan bhi nelp piessi kii samiksha karte huye isi parinaam par pahunchi thi ki maujuuda prakriya sarkari bhagidaari ke hit surakshit rakhane main pratikul asar daalati he, is lihaaj se utpaadan bhagidaari anubandh ke formula kii samiksha ke liye yah kaaphi he
 The CAG has stated that in the case of future Production Participation Agreement (PSC), the investment in the sector and the multiplicity increase therein should be kept separate from the share of profits
 ‘piessi main boli yogya munafa bhagidaari ke liye keval ek boli honi chaiye
 This will reduce the attractiveness of capital expenditure and production drag, due to which the government's share of petroleum profits decreases
 mumbai main gaddhon kii 17200 shikaayatein ainvbhnch ne dhyaan diya sirf 3500 parkol, massej karne par bhi nahin mila javabmumbai main khule gaddhon ne logon kii pareshaaniyaan badha di he
 Like last year, this year too, taxpayers' hard earned money is going to the well
 vajah he biemasi (brihanmumbai mahanagar palika) kaa gaiyr jimmedaarana ravaiya
 However, BMC claims that it is leaving no stone unturned to ensure hassle-free movement on the streets of Mumbaikars
 lekin jamini str par pichley saal kii tulana main koi khaas badlaav najar nahin aa rahaa
 Mumbai and the suburbs have not been raining for the last few days, but still people here are troubled by pits emerging from place to place
 biemasi main vipaksh ke netaa ravi raja ne logon kii pareshaani par apane twit main kaha he, “biemasi ko pichley 30 dinon main gaddhon kii 1578 shikaayatein milin
 It is a shame for the administration
 lekin ab BMC ko aankadon kaa adhyayan or vishleshan karnaa chahie
 It should also be compared with previous data
 aise main jahaan kharaab se kharaab sthiti banati he unki pahchaan kerani chahie taaki vahaan aasapaas ke logon ko pareshaani kaa saamana nahin karnaa pade
 "if we talk about the data available between June 10 and August 1 this year, more than 100 complaints were received in most of the wards
 kis ward se kitni shikaayatene ward -102kei ward -291,kedblyoo ward -149el ward -123pien ward -158pies ward -132ares ward -109es ward -191aadhikarik data se pataa chalata he ki biemasi ne kul mili shikayaton main se 89
 23 percent disposed off and only 10
 77 fisadi shikaayatein hi lambit hai
 In such a situation one can wonder why people are facing so many pits in the city when BMC is working so well
 varsh 2019 main sirf mumbai main 17200 gaddhon kii shikaayatein darj huin
 Out of these, the BMC settled only 3500 complaints
 baaki kii taraf dekha tak nahin gaya
 This is the reason why people today are asking why there are so many pits in this so-called international city? According to Congress leader Ravi Raja, the only reason for this is that BMC is not doing its job properly
 vipaksh kaa aarope he ki biemasi asia ke sabase amir naagarik nikaayon main se ek he
 It spends 2000 crores rupees on new roads every year
 lekin itani rakam khapaane ke baad bhi apekshit maanakon ke mutabik ground par nattejey najar nahin aate
 Despite being repaired by BMC, pits emerge every year in monsoon
 india today ko pataa chalaa he ki biemasi ne is saal gaddhon kii marammat ke liye kareeb 125 karod rupee aavantit kiye
 The opposition also alleges that two years ago a company was given a contract to prepare cold mix material to fill the pit
 yah saaf taur par ek kharaab kadam tha lekin phir bhi ise jari rakhaa gaya
 Such a step turned out to be a disaster
 kyonki pehali hi barish main ye cold mix saamagree bah gai
 Yet the same method is being continued which has failed
 vipakshi netaa kaa aarope he ki kahin na kahin aisa lagata he ki biemasi kii taraf se cold mix ke thekedaaron ko laabh pahunchane kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 In many parts of the city, BMC is still using paver blocks to fill the pits
 jo ek baar ukhd jane ke baad sadakon par bike savaaron ke liye afat sabit hote hai
 When Aaj Tak got information in this regard, it was told that three years ago the city commissioner had ordered not to use paver block on the roads
 spasht rup se us aadesh kaa paalan nahin kiya ja rahaa he or shahar ke kai hisson main pevar block ke ukhdane kaa asar dekha ja saktaa he
 It is understandable that the situation is so critical that Mumbaikars have now taken up the task of filling the pit themselves
 pothole varirs ke naam se enjio chalaane vaale mushtak ansaari or irfan machiwala ne pichley saal se lagbhag 343 gadde thik karne kaa kaary kiya he
 Both claim that this year alone they have filled 39 pits in many parts of the city
 BMC kii ore se istemaal kiye jane vaala mishran milavati he or use kancreet bajri ke saath mix kiya jaataa he
 It does not freeze in pits
 ejiniyaron kii ore se is kaam par nigaraanee nahin rakhi jaati
 When the BMC officers tried to know his side in this regard, after several messages and calls, no response was received

 haalanki kahin-kahin yah bhi khabaren hai ki rithik ko script pasand nahin ai, isiilie unhone yah film karne se manaa kar diya he
 Recently during a talk show Kangana said that Hrithik had a breakup with her in 2014
 lekin usee saal 'queen' ke hit hone ke baad wo dobaaraa unki jindagi main aa gaye the
 Because of this, Hrithik Roshan is sitting silent on the statements of Kangana Ranaut! It seems that Hrithik did not like it and that's why he pulled his hands from this film
 haal hi main jab rithik se is product ke bare main poocha gaya to unhone kaha tha ki agar itani acchhee kahani dikhaane kaa mauka miltaa he to yah bahut acha he

 Laid
 deccan chargers ne ballebaaji kaa nyauta milane ke baad del sten (18 ran dekar teen wicket) ke shuruaati kahar se ubarte hue rohit (51) or monish mishra (41) ke bich chauthe wicket ke liye 82 ran kii saajhedaari kii madad se chah wicket par 151 ran kaa sammanjanak score banaaya
 Naiya of Royal Challengers continued to giggle
 bich main rahul dravid (49) or jaak kallis ne use kuch sahaara diya jabaki robin uthppa (20 gend par 34 ran) ke usko paar lagane kii aas jagaayi lekin bich main 18 gend ke andar chaar wicket ganvaane kii pidaa use aakhir tak pareshaan karti rahi or aakhir main anil kumble kii team 19
 Stacked for 138 runs in 4 overs and got trapped in Agar Magar's vortex
 deccan ke is tarah ke ab 12 match main 12 ank ho gayi hai or ran rate kharaab hone ke baavjood vah paanchaven number par kabiz hokar antim chaar kii daud main bani hui he
 Royal Challengers also have the same number of points in 12 matches but they are in second place on the basis of better run speed
 match behad utaar chadhaav vaala rahaa tathaa kabhi palada idhar to kabhi duusari taraf jhuk jaataa lekin aakhir main aar pi singh, pragyan ojha, harmeep singh or riyaan haris ke do-do wicket nirnaayak sabit hue
 Harris dismissed Manish Pandey on the first ball of the innings
 iske baad kallis or dravid ne duusare wicket ke liye 74 ran kii saajhedaari kii
 Dravid's contribution in this was important whose dismissal broke the partnership
 dravid ne jab tab gend ko seemaa rekha paar bhejkar score board chalyman rakhaa tathaa andrew symonds kii flite leti gend par lalachaakar kaich thamane se pehle apni pari main aath chauke lagaaye
 Kallis was playing very slowly, which cost him 62 balls in his partnership with Dravid
 kallis jab ojha kii gend par bi sumnath ko kaich dekar dagout main pahunche to unke naam ke aage 37 gend par 27 ran or keval ek chaukaa darj tha
 Uthappa hit the first six at midwicket in Symonds' next over but falling under the wicket from the other end put pressure on him
 toornament main sarvaadhik 18 wicket lekar purple cap pahanane vaale ojha ne kallis ke baad viraat kohli ko bhi sumnath ke haathon kaich karaayaa jabaki is bich aar pi singh khubasurat yarker par rose tailor ke viketon ke liye jaljla lekar aaye
 He also dismissed Cameron White in his next over
 haris ne is bich 18wein over main 21 ran de diye jisamen uthppa ke do chakke bhi shaamil hai
 Harmeet Singh however gave Deccan a valuable wicket of Uthappa who was bowled on the leg cutter
 sten agali gend par pagabaadha out ho gayi jiske baad chalangers kii pari simtane main der nahin lagi
 The Deccan Chargers, who reached the backfoot with the early havoc of Deccan Chargers' Deccan Chargers, shared an 82-run partnership for the fourth wicket between Rohit Sharma (51) and Monish Mishra (41) against Royal Challengers Bangalore for six wickets on Monday
 Scored a respectable score of the run
 semifinal kii daud main bane rahane ke liye karo yaa maro ke mukaam par pahunchi deccan kii ballebaaji kaa nyauta milane par shuruyaat bhayaavah rahi
 The bat of his captain Adam Gilchrist has been forgotten as if to run
 unhone sten kii pari kii jo pehali gend kheli vahi unke balle kaa kinaaraa lekar wicketiper robin uthppa ke dastaanon main samaa gayi
 The storm of the South African fast bowler did not stop here
 unhone agali gend par form main chal rahe tii suman ko bhi rose tailor ko haathon kaich karakar hetric kii sambhaavna jagaa di
 His compatriot Herschelle Gibbs (12), who saved Stan's hat-trick, would also be napped soon but he missed a catch from Taylor's hands in r Vinay Kumar's over
 baharhaal tailor kii yah chook royal chalangers ko adhik mahangi nahin padi or sten ne agle over main hi 143 kimi kii raftaar vaali gend se gibs ke viketon ko trahimam karvaa diya
 Dekken's score was 14 for three wickets after just 15 balls

 Jitiya Vrat has great importance in Hinduism
 bhagwaan jiutvahan putr par aane vaali sabhi samasyaon ko dur karne main madadgaar hai
 It is believed that by doing this one also gets a son
 aaie aapako is vrath kii katha or iske mahatv ke bare main vistaar se bataate hai
 There was a city named Kanchanabati near the Kathanarmada river of Jitiya fast
 vahaan kaa raja malyketu tha
 To the west of the Narmada River was the desert, which was called Baluhata
 vahaan vishaal pakad kaa ped tha
 The eagle lived on it
 ped ke neeche khodhar tha, jisamen siaarin rahati thi
 Both Chil and Sarin were friends
 ek baar donon ne milakar jitiya vrath karne kaa sankalp liya
 Then both of them kept the Nirjala fast for the worship of Lord Jiutavahana
 vrath vaale din us nagar ke bade vyapaaree kii mrityu ho gayi
 Now he was cremated at the same desert
 kaali raat hui or ghanghor gata barasane lagi
 Sometimes lightning strikes, sometimes clouds thunder
 toofaan aa gaya tha
 Siyarin was now hungry
 murda dekhakar vah khud ko roak na saki or uskaa vrath tut gaya
 But the eagle kept sobriety and followed the fast on the next day with rules and reverence
 Then in the next birth both the women were born as daughters in the Brahmin family
 unke pita kaa naam bhaskar tha
 Chil became the elder sister and was named Shilwati
 shilvati kii shaadi buddhisen ke saath hui
 Siyaran was born as a younger sister and was named Kapuravati
 uski shaadi us nagar ke raja malayaketu se hui
 Now Kapuravati became the queen of Kanchanabati Nagar
 bhagwaan jiutvahan ke aashirwad se shilvati ke saat bete hue
 But all the children of Kapuravati died as soon as they were born
 kuch samay baad shilvati ke saaton putr bade ho gaye
 They all started working in the king's court
 kapuravati ke man main unhen dekh irshyaa kii bhaavana aa gayi
 He told the king and cut off the heads of all the sons
 unhen saat nae bartan mangvakar usamen rakh diya or laal kapade se dhakkar shilvati ke paas bhijwa diya
 Seeing this, Lord Jiutavahana made the heads of the seven brothers from the soil and sprinkled nectar on everyone's head by attaching it to his torso
 isse unamem jaan aa gai
 The seven men became alive and returned home
 jo kate sar rani ne bheje the ve fal ban gaye
 Rani Kapuravati, on the other hand, was anxious to get information from Budhisen's house
 jab kaaphi der soochna nahin ai to kapuravati swayan badi bahan ke ghar gayi
 She was shocked to see everyone alive there
 jab use hosh aayaa to bahan ko usne sari baat bataai
 Now he was regretting his mistake
 bhagwaan jiutvahan kii krupa se shilvati ko purv janm kii baaten yaad aa gayi
 She went to the same Pakad tree with Kapuravati and told him all the things
 kapuravati behosh ho gai or mar gai
 When the king got the news of this, he went to the same place and cremated Kapuravati under the Pakad tree

 petrol, dijal or rasoi gas silendar kii keemton main badhotaree lagbhag tay maani ja rahi he
 Petrol and diesel prices where 3
 50 rupee prati litre tak bad sakate hai, vahiin alpiji ke daamon main 25 se 50 rupee tak kii vruddhi ho sakati he
 a group of ministers will consider raising petroleum prices on Monday
 haalanki, kerosine kii keemton main vruddhi maamuli hi hone kii sambhaavna he
 The Empowered Group of Ministers (egom) headed by Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee is going to meet on Monday afternoon to consider the recommendations of the Kirit Parikh Committee
 samiti ne petrol or dijal kii keemton ko sarkaar ke niyantran se mukt karne tathaa alpiji or kerosine ke daamon main baari vruddhi kaa suzav diya he
 An official of the Petroleum Ministry said, "it is no longer possible to sell fuel cheaper than the imported price
 yadi keemton main badhotaree nahin hoti he, to sarkaar ko petrol, dijal, alpiji or kerosine ko aaayaatit mulya se kam par bechney ke kaaran hone vaale 72,300 karod rupee ke ghate kii bharpai ke liye koi rasta nikaalnaa hoga
 "there is a great possibility that petrol prices should be deregulated
 vitt mantri sambhavat: dijal kii keemton ko niyantran mukt karne kii baat bhi rakhenge
 Diesel is the most used fuel in the country and is used in the transport sector and also has an inflationary effect

 "if Mamata agrees, then diesel prices can be deregulated
" ’’ isi tarah gharelu alpiji kii keemton main bhi 50 rupee tak prati silendar kii badhotaree tay maani ja rahi he
 However, under pressure from Mamta and other allies, this increase may be reduced

 49 per liter
 dilli main petrol kii keemat philhal 47
 93 per liter, while diesel costs 38
 10 rupee prati litre he
 With international crude oil prices coming down by about ten dollars to 72 to 74 dollars per barrel, it will be easier for the government to deregulate fuel prices
 adhikari ne bataaya ki pichley saptaah tak petrol kii keemton main 6
 07 per liter and 6 in the price of diesel
 38 rupee prati litre kii badhotaree kii jarurat thi
 It would be politically difficult for the government to raise prices so much, especially diesel prices so much at one go
 par ab jis vruddhi kii jarurat he, vah kaaphi uchit he
 Public sector Indian Oil Corporation, Hindustan Petroleum and Bharat Petroleum are incurring a daily loss of Rs 203 crore by selling fuel below cost

 Loss of Rs 49 per liter, Kerosene through Public Distribution System 18
 82 rupee prati litre tathaa 14
 261 to LPG of 2 kg
 90 rupee prati silendar ke ghate par bechaa ja rahaa he
 The official said that the EGOM would probably not accept the Parikh Committee's suggestion to increase the price of kerosene by Rs 6 per liter and the price of LPG by Rs 100 per cylinder
 keemton main badhotaree isse kam hogi
 Apart from Mukherjee, Petroleum Minister Murli Deora, Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar, Chemicals and Fertilizers Minister MK Alagiri, Railway Minister Mamta Banerjee, Road Transport and Highways Minister Kamal Nath and Planning Commission Deputy Chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia are among others in the egom on fuel

 Rupa Ganguly stood in his seat and said that the Chairman would have to give him time to speak
 agar sabhapati unhen bolne kaa samay nahin dete hai, to vah unki seat ke paas aakar bolengi
 Along with him, some BJP mps also started speaking in his favor
 isi dauraan rajani patil ke bayaan kaa virodh karte hue roopa sabhapati ke aasaan (wel) tak pahunch gayi

 The Chairman kept asking him constantly whether his name was taken

 On this, the Chairman assured him in the House that we will get the entire record checked, if the name of the MP is taken in any form, it will be removed

 'aaj Tak' had a special conversation with Minister of State for Law PP Chaudhary on the disputed ordinance brought by the Vasundhara Raje government in Rajasthan
 baatcheet ke dauraan ve us adhyadesh kaa bachaav karte najar aae
 According to him, the ordinance is not to save the corrupt but to save honest officials from all the troubles
 rajasthan sarkaar dwaara laae gaye ordinance par kanoon rajya mantri peepi choudhary ne kaha, "jo ordinance rajasthan sarkaar lekar ai he vah bhrashtachari logon ko bachaane ke liye nahin he
 This is to save honest people
 magistrate ho lok sevak ho
 When there are false allegations, an FIR is registered
 use bure daur se guzarana padataa he
 Media goes on trial
 baad main paaya jaataa he ki vah aarope galat the
 If allegations are made that are not right
 agar thik nahin he to unako bahut pidaa hoti he
 Therefore investigation is necessary after making allegations
 jaanch main agar paaya jaataa he ki koi doshi he to uske khilaaf karrwai hogi
 Anyone charges against anyone, ordinance has been brought in view of all these things
 "apni baat ko or spasht karte hue choudhary ne aage kaha, "yah bhrashtachari logon ko bachaane ke liye nahin he
 There is no scope for corrupt people
 sirf samay kii baat he
 Must have at least 1 fact finding inquiry
 koi bhi court main ja saktaa he
 Anyone can register an FIR
 kisi ko manaa nahin he
 But before that, if the court gives the police to investigate
 yah pehle hi pataa lagaana chahie ki public sarvice ke khilaaf jo aarope he usamen kuch dam he
 No one has made the allegations knowingly
 kisi adhikari ke khilaaf badnaam karne ke liye to ye aarope nahin lagaae gaye hai
 "on opposition to the ordinance, Chaudhary said," Making a noise about ordinance is a political stunt of Congress
 congress to koi bhi acha kaam karo uske khilaaf khadi ho jaati he
 This is his job
 yah raajnneetik stant he
 Congress has nothing to do with this
 congress bhrashtachar kii baat karti he congress ne hameshaa bhrasht afasar ko bachaaya
 His vision remains on how to do corruption and the bjp's vision is how to develop
 isliye is par nahin janaa chahie
 Election time
 isliye yahi sab soch kar congress virodh kar rahi he
 The BJP cannot and will not compromise on corruption and corruption
