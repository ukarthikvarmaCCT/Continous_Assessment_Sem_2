 Surprise to see that when we started from India for commonwealth games 2018 my father was confirmed as the team official and i paid the whole amount for that but when we came to the games village
 
 
 his name was cut from team official category 
 
 and he can‚Äôt even stay with me 
 - Saina Nehwal (@nsaina) April 2, 2018 He said, my father cannot watch my matches
 vah mujhase mil bhi nahin sakate
 What kind of help did it get? He can't c my matches and he can't enter the village nor he can meet me in anyway
 
 what kind of support is this
 
 @ thecgf ‚Äî Saina Nehwal (@nsaina) April 2, 2018 Saina said, 'I take my father to matches
 mujhe unke saport kii jarurat rahati he
 i do not understand why i was not told before that if this was to happen
 'I wanted his support as i regularly take him for my competitions 
 
 
 but i didn't understand why nobody informed me all this earlier
 
 That he can't enter anywhere # commonwealthgames2018 ‚Äî Saina Nehwal (@nsaina) April 2, 2018 However, the controversy ended within 24 hours with the initiative of the Indian Olympic Association (IOA)

 com / fwcvrlk4yv ‚Äî Saina Nehwal (@nsaina) April 3, 2018 After this, Jwala has attacked Saina
 vaise sina nehwal or jwaala gutta ke bich jubaani jang nai nahin he
 In 2012, Jwala commented on Saina and said that she is not the only hardworking player, but she is promoted
 jwaala kii shikaayat rahi he ki unke saath badminton association of india ne hameshaa se sautela vyavhaar kiya he
 After this, in 2013 too Jwala targeted Saina
 sina ne indonesia ke diggaj badminton khilaadi toufeeq hidaayat par tippanee kii thi, jiske virodh main jwaala ne sina kaa naam liye bina unhen saathi khilaadiyon kii izzat karne ko kaha tha
 Former Olympic and world champion Hidayat had complained of discrimination with foreign players in the Indian Badminton League and the lack of money
 is par sina ne kaha tha ki hidaayat ko yah nahin bhoolanaa chahie ki vah ritair ho chuke hai
 Jwala then tweeted without naming Saina, 'taufiq is a great player and i don't think you should dismiss his point just because he has retired

 The Indian team has been battling its batsmen's long-running poor form and selection dilemma and will have to come on the ground without the services of in-form captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni in a crucial match against Sri Lanka in the tri-series in India on Tuesday
 
 dhoni par australia ke khilaaf bharat ke pichley match main dhimi over gati ke liye ek match kaa pratibandh laga tha jisamen use ravivaar ko gaba main 110 ran kii karaari shikast mili thi
 Playing Sachin Tendulkar also looks doubtful as Brett Lee's bouncer hit his head
 kshetrarakshan ke dauraan bhi slip main khadey tendulkar ke pair main gend lag gayi thi jisase vah australia ke 50 over main se 25 over maidan se baahar rahe the
 The Indian team is only two points ahead of Sri Lanka but has played an extra match
 bharat ko srilanka ke khilaaf apane bache hue do maichon main jeet darj kar final main pahunchane ke maukey ko badhanaa hoga
 India have three matches left, one of which will be against Australia in Sydney on 26 February and two matches against Sri Lanka
 jahaan tak team sangyojan kii baat he, shrinkhalaa main shuru se bani lay gadabada gayi he kyonki uske form main chal rahe wicketiper ballebaaj dhoni mangalvaar ke match main uplabdh nahin ho paayenge
 With this, Virender Sehwag will lead the team and Parthiv Patel will play his first match in the series as a wicketkeeper but the Indians still have to think about the batsmen
 team nishchit rup se aar aswin ko team main shaamil karegi jisane shrinkhalaa main apane sabhi paanch wicket srilanka ke khilaaf hasil kiye hai
 India will also have to choose from four medium pacers Zaheer Khan, Umesh Yadav, Vinay Kumar and Irfan Pathan to keep the team combination balanced
 aakraamak gendbaaji ko dekhte hue jahir ko antim ekadash main hona hi chahie
 Pathan may have lost runs but he did a useful job with the bat and the ball
 vinay kumaar ne apane antim teen over chhodkar acchhee gendbaaji kii thi
 This makes Umesh Yadav the only bowler out, even though he bowled at a speed of 150 kmph more than once in the last match
 bharat sheersh kram main gautam gambhir ke saath barkaraar rahanaa chahega lekin yuva madhyakram ballebaajon kaa pradarshan itnaa acha nahin rahaa he
 In the middle order, young trio Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma and Suresh Raina have disappointed in the series, although Delhi batsman Kohli played a brilliant 77 against Sri Lanka in Perth
 rohit ne paanch maichon main 79 ran banaaye hai jabaki raina ne itani hi pariyon main 102 ran jode hai
 Most importantly, India will miss the important in-form batsman Dhoni
 dhoni ne maujuuda shrinkhalaa main do ardhashtakon se 63
 Has scored 191 runs at an average of 66
 jahaan tak wicketcaping kii baat he to unhone teen kaich or do stump out karne ke alaava kuch khilaadiyon ko ran out bhi kiya he
 Despite his experience, Parthiv Patel will have to work hard at the wicket-keeping spot
 mahela jayavardhane sidney main australia ke khilaaf apni 60 ran kii pari se ballebaaji ke usee puraane andaaj main dikh rahe the
 Tillakaratne Dilshan always tries to play big innings
 srilankai team maidan par behtareen dikh rahi he or jayavardhane behtareen dhang se team kii aguwai kar rahe hai
 In Madhya Pradesh, people got angry after seeing a scary scene on Saturday
 darasal logon ne jab sarerah ek ajgar ko bakrii nigalate dekha to unke hosh phakhta ho gaye
 The case is of Pipariya Khurd village of Narsinghpur
 police ke mutabik, shanivaar dopaher kuch log apane gharon ke baahar baithe the
 At the same time people heard the sound of goat screaming at some distance from the road
 jab log vahaan pahunche to vahaan kaa manjar dekh sabhi sann rah gaye
 In fact, about 10 feet tall dragon was making a goat its morsel before the eyes of the villagers
 graminon ne fouran van vibhaag or police ko isaki soochna di
 By the time the police and forest department team reached there, the dragon had swallowed the goat completely
 bakrii ko nigalane ke baad ajgar ek naale main jaakar baith gaya
 After hard work, the forest department team took a 10 feet long dragon out of the drain and put it in a cage
 jiske baad van vibhaag ne ajgar ko aabaadi vaale ilaake se dur le jaakar jangal main chhod diya
 The case of python swallowing a goat alive remained the subject of discussion throughout the day
 bataa den ki isse pehle bhi madhyapradesh ke adivasee bahulya ilaake alirajpur main eijgarne bakrii ko apana niwala bana liya tha
 In the delhi-ncr region, the case of rape with the woman has once again come to light

 The victim girl said that accused Akhil has retained her and many other girls' MMS
 jiske bare main wo aksar dhamkee detaa rahata he

 isi cese main juthi gavaahi dene ke liye akhil peedita par lambey samay se dawaab bana rakhaa tha

 donon companiyon ko raksha saude kii prakriya (DPP-2013) ke standard contract dastavej ke kai praavdhaanon ke anupaalan se chhot di gai
 Exemption seekers were particularly troubled by two things - provisions set in the offset contract for arbitration (article 9) and access to the books of industrial suppliers (article 12)
 hichak rahe the manohar parrikar!in chhot kii maangon ko tatkaaleen raksha mantri manohar parrikar kii adhyakshata vaali raksha kharid parishad (DAC) ne 'antim samiksha or manjuuri' ke liye sisies ke paas bheja tha
 It has been claimed in the news that the Defense Minister himself was feeling very uncomfortable in approving it at his level, as it was a matter of doing something quite different from the defense procurement process
 chupchaap hataai gayi do shartenyahi nahin dissi ne chupchaap do or mahatvapurn anivaary sharton ko hataa diya
 There is a strict provision in DPP 2013 that the contract shall not have any 'undue influence' and 'commission cannot be given to an agent or agency'
 isamen yah bhi praavdhaan he ki agar koi nijee industrial saplir iskaa ulanghan karata he to uske khilaaf dandatmak karrwai kii jaae
 But the DAC quietly removed these conditions
 yahi nahin, ise hataane ke liye sisies se manjuuri lene kii jarurat bhi nahin samajhi gai

 yah kareeb 30 hajaar karod rupee kaa hota he or saude ke chauthe saal (oktober 2019) se aage saatven saal tak yani kul teen saal main puraa kiya jayega
 This means there will be zero liability in the first three years, while 57 percent accountability will have to be fulfilled in the seventh year
 pehle teen saal main donon francisi companiyon ko mek in india main koi yogadan nahin hoga
 Changed Offset Proposal Final report of INT suggests that Dassau Aviation and mbda's initial offset proposal was something else, but it was decided at the January 4, 2016 meeting of the Ministry of Defense to ask French companies to immediately submit a new offset proposal Go gauratlab he ki deshbhar main loksabhaa chunaav kaa abhiyaan chal rahaa he, aise main modi sarkaar apni kalyankari yojanaon ko saamne rakh janata ko vikaas kaa saboot de rahi he to congress ne sarkaar ke khilaaf rafel deal ko lekar morcha kholaa he

 By the way when Shibani was asked about this relationship, she said, "I am not a girl who secretes anything
" magar mujhe kisi cheez kaa dhindhora peetane kii jarurat nahin he
 ‚Äúwe are public figures

 " aam chunaav se kuch maheene pehle desh kii arthvyavastha utani gulabi dikhaai nahin detii jitani narendra modi kii aguai vaali bhartiya janata party sarkaar chaahati rahi hogi
 Despite claims of easing the tax structure through the Goods and Services Tax (GST), some far-reaching reforms on the financial front through the new insolvency law and softening crude oil prices for most of the tenure, the government is struggling with a turbulent economy
 upie hukumat se viraasat main mili jarjar arthvyavastha ko patari par laane, oonchi aarthik vruddhi hasil karne, zyada naukariyaan or behatar jeevanstyli dene ke vaade par satta main aane ke sandarbh main dekhen to halaat or badtar dikhte hai
 This disappointment has come to the fore in the 'desh ka Mood' survey of January 2019
 haalanki yah aam dharna kaayam he ki modi sarkaar kaa aarthik kaamkaaj congress kii aguai vaali upie sarkaar se behatar rahaa he, magar aisa maanane waalon kii taadaad kam hui he
 49 per cent of the people surveyed still believe that the bjp-led NDA government has done better, but a seven per cent drop in the number of people who believe so in the last one year will be a matter of great concern for the government
 28 fisadi jitani badi taadaad main logon ko yah bhi lagata he ki aarthik kaamkaaj ke lihaaj se is sarkaar ne badtar kaam kiya he, jo pichley saat survey main aisa maanane waalon kii sabase zyada taadaad he
 Overall 41 per cent of the people feel that the performance of this government on the economic front is either similar to or worse than the UPA government
 is dharna kii kya vajahen hai? is vittiya saal main arthvyavastha ke 7
 It is expected to grow at a rate of 2 per cent, but according to it, the feeling of boom and enthusiasm is not felt roundly
 chaahe vah naukariyon kaa sawaal ho, nivesh kaa yaa nai pariyojnaon kaa-aamtaur par yahi ahsaas tari he ki or bahut kuch kiya ja saktaa tha
 The truth is that according to the Center for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE), investment in new projects in the last three months of 2018 fell to the lowest level since the BJP came to power in 2014
 thap padi pariyojnaon kaa mulya badhkar maujuuda sarkaar ke kaarykaal ke duusare sabase oonche str par pahunch gaya he
 The fiscal deficit crossed the 112 per cent mark of the target in these eight months
 care reating kii report kahati he ki is baat kii puri sambhaavna he ki is vitt varsh main centre kaa rajkoshiya ghate kaa 3
 The target of 3 percent will not be met
 report kahati he, ''ham jidipi ke 0
 1 percent to 0
 2 fisadi ke aasapaas giravat kii ummid karte hai, jo rajkoshiya ghate ko jidipi ke 3
 5 per cent level
 '' jiesti kaa sangrah raftaar kaayam nahin rakh sakaa or vinievesh ke lakshya ab bhi pahunch se bahut dur hai
 Like last time, in this survey too many people feel that prices of essential commodities have gone up, although the reality is that inflation is under control and in some things like vegetables, there has been negative inflation or deflation
 dharna yah he ki keemton main badhotaree ho rahi he or survey main shaamil 68 fisadi log maanate hai ki beete paanch saal main jaruri chizon ke daam bade hai
 This may be due to fuel prices, which remained high for several weeks before the global crude oil prices softened
 aise logon kii taadaad main bhi thodi kami ai he jo maanate hai ki beete paanch saal main unki aarthik haalat (aamadani or bachat) main badlaav aayaa he
 However, 40 per cent said that their economic condition has improved during this period, which is six percent less than the number of those who said so in the January 2018 'desire of the Country' survey during the last one year
 bhrashtachar ab bhi mudda bana hua he
 70 percent of the people say that there has been no reduction in corruption in their daily lives
 zyada chintaa kii baat yah he ki 34 fisadi logon kaa kahana tha ki beete paanch saal main bhrashtachar main ijapha hi hua he
 Jobs are the top concern, however the biggest concern is about the creation of jobs
 1
 The government's promise of 2 crore new jobs has become a bone of its own
 yah hameshaa kaha jaataa rahaa he ki desh main kitni naukariyaan paidaa huin, yah maapne kaa koi achook tarika nahin he
 Based on the payroll data of the Employees Provident Fund Organization (EPFO) in September 2018, the government argues that in the month of July, about 1 million jobs were created in the formal sector
 magar is aankade kii sachaai par chautarafa sawaal uthaae gaye hai or kuch arthshaastriyon ne kaha ki is aankade ko rojgaar kaa data samajhane kii bhul nahin kerani chahie, kyonki ipiefo main darj naamon main badhotaree anaupchaarik kamgaaron kaa aupchaarik main badalanaa bataati he
 According to CMIE, more than 10 million jobs were lost in the year ending December 2018, while the unemployment rate rose in December to a seven-month high of 7
 38 fisadi par pahunch gai
 a significant number of jobs lost (83%) have been in rural areas
 'desh kaa mizaaj' survey main bhi yah chintaa jaahir hui he
 When asked whether the government is doing enough to create more jobs? So 46 percent said no, she is not
 haalanki jin logon ko lagata he ki sarkaar kaaphi kuch kar rahi he, unki taadaad main agast 2018 ke pichley survey ke 42 fisadi ke mukaable 5 fisad ankon kaa ijapha hua he
 One of the reasons for this is that the government's spending on roads and infrastructure is increasing jobs in the construction sector
 modi sarkaar ko pataa he ki naukariyon ke morche par vah icchit mukaam se bahut dur he or isliye sambhaavna yahi he ki vah khaali sarkari pad bharne ke liye jabardast bhartee abhiyaan kaa elaan karegi
 In all, over 29 lakh positions are lying vacant in the central and state governments
 agar sarkaar inhen bharti he to is par 1 lakh karod rupye kharch aa saktaa he or tankhwaah baantne ke centre ke bajet main 76 fisadi kii badhotaree ho sakati he
 According to the formula recommended by the Seventh Pay Commission, the initial minimum salary of an employee has increased from Rs 7,000 to Rs 18,000 per month
 jaahir he, sarkaar ke paas tamaam khaali pade ohadon ko bharne ko paisa nahin he, magar bhaajapa ke andruni sutara ise naukariyon ke bagaiyr growth ke afsane kaa muqabla karne kii garaj se ahm kadam ke taur par dekhte hai
 This recruitment drive can be part of the announcements taking into consideration the middle class

 Before becoming Prime Minister, Modi vowed to bring back the black money stashed abroad
 pichley chaar saal main kai emnesti yaa aam maafee yojanaon kaa elaan kiya gaya‚Äîaay ghoshnaa yojana jisamen 65,250 karod rupye aae, pradhanmantri garibi kalyaan yojana main kareeb 5,000 karod rupye kaa khulaasa hua or kaala dhan tathaa kar aropan kanoon ke jariye 4,100 karod rupye saamne aae
 The law was introduced in 2015 to provide a window of three months for people to disclose undisclosed foreign assets
 koi 650 logon ne isamen 4,100 karod rupye kii videshon main jamaa rakam kaa khulaasa kiya tha
 There have been different estimates of black money
 kuch agenciyaan ise bharat ke jidipi kaa takreeban 20 fisadi bataati hai
 The truth is that to target black money, the Prime Minister announced his most audacious policy move - demonetisation - which declared about 86 percent of the country's currency illegal
 november 2016 main modi ne apane jis bhaashan main notebandi kaa elaan kiya, usamen 17 baar kaale dhan shabd kaa istemaal kiya tha
 The Reserve Bank of India, in its annual report for 2017-18, confirmed that 99
 3 fisadi pratibandhit note laut aae the, jabaki chautarafa jabardast ummid kii ja rahi thi ki 3-4 lakh karod rupye swaha hokar banking vyavastha se baahar chale jaaenge
 The assumption is that Modi may have lost the battle in the matter of black money, as the survey of the country shows that 46 per cent of the people feel that black money has returned in the form of new notes
 46 fisadi ko lagata he ki sarkari bainkon ke saath rigerv bank kii swaittata se samjhauta kiya gaya he
 Another major consequence of the banking crisis is that people's trust in public sector banks (psbs) has been eroded
 hira kaarobaari neerav modi or kingfisher ke vijay maalya se jude haai-profile maamalon ne sarkari kshetra ke bainkon or unki vyavastha main baari-bharkam khaamiyon ko beparda kar diya he jisase naubat yah aa gai ki duniya kii paanchavin sabase zyada gaiyr-nishpadit sampattiyaan (enpie) yaa khote karj hindustan main hai
 77 of 21 psbs right now
 3 fisadi banking kshetra par kabja he or 70 fisadi se zyada kul banking sampattiyaan inhen bainkon ke paas hai
 The government holds the majority stake in these banks
 'desh kaa mizaaj' survey main shaamil kareeb 45 fisadi logon ne kaha ki saarvajanik kshetra ke bainkon main unka yaa to kabhi bharosa tha hi nahin yaa ab unka bharosa khatm ho gaya he
 Interestingly, 43 per cent of the people also said that they now have more trust in psbs

 In the last 2-3 years, successive state governments have announced loan waiver for farmers at a cost of about Rs 1,80,000 crore
 yah jahiraa taur par kisaanon ke gusse ko shant bhar karne kaa upaay he, kyonki karj maafee jameen par virale hi koi badlaav laa paati he
 But 68 percent of the respondents said that debt waiver is the right step towards reducing the difficulties of farmers

 pichley maheene bhi tejasvi yadav apane janadesh apmaan yatra ke dauraan bhagalpur pahunche the or srijan ghotaale ko lekar sabor block main jansabha karne kaa kaarykram tha magar madhya raatri ke dauraan hue drama main jila prashasan ne tejasvi ko is sabha ko karne kii ijaajat nahin di or unhen khaali haath waapas lautnaa padaa tha
 Tejashwi had said at the time that Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Modi did not want Tejashwi to hold a meeting in Bhagalpur over the scam

 aam bajet se ek din pehle guuruuvaar ko vitt mantri nirmala sitaraman ne aarthik surveykshan ko sadan ke patal par pesh kiya
 In this report, emphasis has been laid on preparing data for the betterment of social sectors and the poor
 report main kaha gaya he ki sarkaron ke paas pehle se hi nagarikon ke prashasnic, surveykshan, sansthagat or tranjection kaa data maujuud he, lekin inhen ekatrit karne kii jarurat he
 According to the report, by collecting the databases scattered in different ministries at one place, citizens can be made to experience better services
 kehane kaa matlab yah he ki sarkaar iske jariye apane nagarikon ko behatar seva muhaiyaa kara sakati he
 The advantage will be that the chances of mistakes in welfare schemes for the poor will also be reduced
 nijee kshetra main dakhal degi sarkaar!aarthik survey kii report main nijee kshetra main dakhal kii sifarish kii gai he
 The report said that where there is no profit, the private sector does not invest
 aise main ab sarkaar ko is kshetra main dakhal dena chahie or data taiyaar kiya janaa chahie
 According to the survey, the private sector has done a remarkable job in collecting data where it shows benefits, but the government should intervene in social sectors where the private sector has not been sufficiently invested to collect data
 survey main bataaya gaya he ki niztaa kii suraksha or gopneey soochnaaon ko saajha karne ke liye pehle se hi unnat takanic uplabdh he
 In such a situation, the government can prepare data for the betterment of citizens under the purview of privacy law
 data logon dwaara logon ke liye jutaya janaa chahie
 It has been said in the survey that while thinking about data for public welfare, care should be taken that the privacy of the rich should not be prioritized over the poor
 aarthik samiksha main kaha gaya he ki data ekatrit karte vakt logon kii sahmati lee jaae yaa kanoonee daayre main rajyon dwaara data ekatrit kiya jaae
 Data collection is to be done in four stages - collection, storage, processing and extension

 Bajaj, who was included as a speaker in a session organized on the topic 'new Beginning for India', criticized the government for the policy environment and said that his company was able to grow 'despite the government'
 unhone kaha, ‚Äòhamane bahut saal pehle, dashakon pehle yah tay kiya tha ki ham aisa koi bhi kaarobaar nahin karenge jahaan hamen sarkaar ke saath samjhauta karnaa pade
 We do not manufacture, we do not buy anything for the government
 ham motorcycle tathaa vittiya seva kshetra main hai
 Rajya Sabha MP Bajaj said that his company deliberately stayed away from power projects, coal mines and infrastructure development despite the company having cash
 baharhaal, bajaj kii ye baaten kumaar ke gale nahin utari
 He said that the company has made significant profits in the last few years
 kumaar ne kaha, ‚Äòyah sahi he ki koi paripurna sthiti nahin hoti or koi bilkul sateek samaadhaan nahin ho
 But if we are doing everything wrong in terms of policy, then how Bajaj Auto would have been among the most successful organizations and would have made significant profits in the last few years
 ‚Äôkumaar ne sawalia lahaze main poocha, ‚Äòkuch log kah rahe hai ki desh main chijen galat ho rahi hai, desh main kuch acha nahin ho rahaa

 ' har cheez ko khaane kaa vakt hota he
 But experts refuse to take certain things, especially on an empty stomach
 jaanate hai, kya he isaki vajah
 Actually, it contains all those things which are acidic
 khaali pet kuch bhi amleey khaane se pet aanton par asar padataa he or sankraman kaa khatra bana rahata he
 1
 sodasoda main ucch maatra main carbonate acid paaya jaataa he
 When it is mixed with the acid present in the stomach, it causes many troubles such as stomach ache
 2
 Tomatoes: There are many benefits of eating raw tomatoes, but eating raw tomatoes on an empty stomach can be harmful
 tamaato main maujuud amleeyta pet main upasthit gastrointstanail acid ke saath kriya karke ek aisa jail banaata he jo pet dard, anthan jaisi samasyaon kaa kaaran banataa he
 Eating tomatoes on an empty stomach also increases the risk of stones
 3
 Medications: You will often hear the doctor say that taking medicines only after eating something
 hamaare gharon main bhi hamen yahi bataaya jaataa he ki koi bhi dawa khaali pet nahin leni chahie
 The main reason for this is that by taking the medicine on an empty stomach it affects the innermost surface of the stomach and by acting with the acids present in the stomach, it disturbs the balance of the body
 4
 Alcohol Many people like to have alcohol on an empty stomach
 aise main nasha jaldi hota he, lekin khaali pet alcohol lene se aanten buree tarah prabhavit hoti hai
 5
 bahut adhik masaaledaar khanazyaadaatar logon ko masaaledaar or chatapata khaanaa pasand hota he lekin aisi chizon ko kabhi bhi khaali pet nahin lenaa chahie
 There are some acids naturally present in our body
 bahut adhik masaaledaar khaanaa khaane se is acid or masaalon ke bich jo rasinic kriya hoti he, uskaa aanton par bura asar padataa he
 6
 coffeekhali pet coffee kaa seven karnaa nuksaandaayak ho saktaa he
 The caffeine present in coffee is not good for the stomach
 agar aapako subah ke samay coffee pine kii aadat he to aap pehle ek gilaas pani pi len
 Only then have a cup of coffee
 isi tarah chaay kaa seven bhi khaali pet nahin karnaa chahie
 Drinking empty stomach tea increases the possibility of gas and constipation

 RJD President Lalu Prasad Yadav is most happy with this decision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 unka maananaa he ki bijepi ne nitish kumaar ko bhav dena band kar diya he
 At the same time, Chief Minister and National President of Janata Dal u Nitish Kumar says that no such proposal came to him nor did he think far about that Janata Dal u will join the Union Cabinet
 is vistaar main keval bijepi ke saansad shaamil hue hai
 Not the nda's constituents, but Nitish Kumar's adversaries are happy despite this
 argedy adhyaksh lalu prasad yadav ne yahaan tak kaha ki nitish kumaar par ab bijepi vishwaas nahin karti he, kyonki wo bihar main congress ko todakar apane ko majboot karnaa chaahate hai
 The BJP is suspicious of this
 lalu prasad yadav apni khushiyon kaa izhaar lagaataar twit se kar rahe hai
 However, there was constant discussion in the media that two ministers of the Janata dal-u would join the Modi cabinet
 sab apane-apane hisaab se naam bhi bataa rahe the
 Rajya Sabha MP of Janata dal-u, RCP Singh, started greeting people at his Delhi residence, but when the Chief Minister spoke to Aaj Tak a day before the expansion, he said that there was no proposal to join the Union Cabinet
 
 is vishay par kisi se baatcheet bhi nahin hui, lekin janata dal you ke baaki netaaon ko kuch sujh nahin rahaa he ki wo kya jawaab den?party kaa kahana he ki mahaj ek maheene pehle endie kii sarkaar bihar main bani he
 There was a proposal from BJP to choose Nitish Kumar as the leader and he took the oath of Chief Minister
 bijepike rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah ne unhen endie main shaamil hone kaa nyotaa diya
 The Janata Dal u formally joined the NDA on 19 August after the National Executive meeting
 ab rahi baat modi mantrimandal main shaamil hone kii, to is vishay par jab bade netaaon ke bich baat hi nahin hui or naa hi koi prastaav tha
 The BJP did not propose to any of its constituents
 aise main yah nahin kaha ja saktaa he ki janata dal ko ignor kiya gaya he

 com / hbcicstqoa duniya kii koi bhi company bina intervyuu kisi karmchaaree ko naukari nahin detii
 Because the interview is not taken just to know or meet the employee
 balki company ke ucch padaadhikari is bahaane aapke bare wo sab bhi jaan lete hai, jise aap sidhe-sidhe kabhi nahin bataate
 For example, counting the drawbacks of your first office, saying inaccurate, talking on the phone, etc
 job intervyuu se pehle fasebuk kii kar len safai, jaane kyon
 
 
 Just here you don't understand and make some mistakes during the interview
 yahi vajah he ki kaabiliyat hote hue bhi kai logon ko unke man mutabik naukari nahin mil paati
 Know which mistakes should be avoided during the interview
 
 
 in baton kaa rakhen dhyaan jab bharen NEET kaa form1
 Do not eat chewing gum in the interview
 isse yah sabit hota he ki aap kisi kii phikr nahin karte
 This has a negative effect on the interviewee
 2
 Some people curse their first job in interviews
 intervyuu lene waalon par iskaa bhi nakaaratmak asar hota he
 Because the rules and arrangements of each company are almost the same
 isliye naukari na milane kii ashanka bad jaati he
 These habits have to be given up to become successful entrepreneurs
 
 
 3
 The person interviewing you should not feel that you are arrogant or not interested in this job
 4
 Selection of interview clothes should also be done wisely
 naukari na milane kii ek vajah ye bhi ho sakati he
 Board Exam is near, manage your time like this 5
 intervyuu main galati se bhi kisi phone kol ko atend na karen
 You can still call back after the interview
 aisa karne par aapako intervyuu lene vaale adhikari kamare se baahar bhi nikaal sakate hai
 In his first address to Donald Trump, once sworn in as America's 45th president, he once appeared in a campaigning mode
 unhone apane bhaashan main islamic aatankwaad ke safaye, americanyon kii naukariyaan waapas dilaane or simaaon ko surakshit karne jaise vaade dohraye
 Read Trump's speech targeting some of the most important terrorists: Donald Trump's sharp attack on Islamic terrorism
 apane bhaashan main unhone kaha, 'ham duniya kii takaton ko kattarpanthi islamic aatankwaad ke khilaaf jang ke liye ek karenge
 We will eliminate terrorism from this earth
 ' trump kii is bhashaa ko aatankwaad ke khilaaf unke kade rukh kaa udhaaharan mana ja rahaa he
 In fact, Trump has been consistently saying that such language has a big impact in the fight against terrorism
 america first kaa arth :trump ne apane bhaashan main 'mek in america' kaa naaraa diya or americanyon ke sapane, naukariyaan or samruddhi lautaane kaa vaada kiya
 He clearly said, 'we will follow two rules - By American, Higher American
 ' unke is bhaashan se mana ja rahaa he ki trump aane vaale samay main naukari ke liye videshiyon ko jari hone vaale vija ke niyamon ko lekar sakht nitiyaan apana sakate hai
 Message to Allied Countries: Donald Trump also gave a message to allied countries in his speech
 unhone kaha, 'ham duusare deshon kii senaaon ko sabsidi dete rahe hai, jabaki hamaari sena pareshaani main he
 We have been protecting the borders of other countries instead of protecting our borders
 duusare deshon main hamane kharbon dollar kharch kiye hai, jabaki america kaa infrastracchar barbaad ho rahaa he
 It is believed by Trump that the United States may cut the defense cooperation it is giving to allied countries in the coming days
 rashtriya janata dal (rajd) ke adhyakshalalu prasadne kaha ki vah gujarat ke mukhyamantrinarendra modiko desh kaa pradhanmantri banane se rokane ke liye sabakuch karenge

 He asked, 'how can a politician who incites hatred in two communities and has been responsible for the deaths of thousands of people in Gujarat in 2002, how can he become the Prime Minister of a secular country like India ?
 'lalune jor dete hue kaha ki chunkimodiko puure bharat kaa samarthan nahin he, isliye unka pradhanmantri banane kaa sapana kabhi puraa nahin ho saktaa

 jharkhand ke saamaajik kaaryakarta jyaan drej samet teen logon ko police ne gadwa jile se hiraasat main liya he
 The three went to a public meeting in Bishunpura, Garhwa, as part of their food rights campaign
 kaarykram shuru karne se pehle hi sthaneey police ne jyaan drej, vivek or ek anya ko hiraasat main le liya
 It is being told that the police have also confiscated their mobile phones
 teenon ko bishunpura thana main rakhaa gaya
 However, the police later gave up
 gadwa ke disi harsh mangala ne bataaya ki prashasan kii taraf se jyaan drej or unke saathiyon ko kisi bhi tarah kii sabha karne kii anumati nahin di thi, iske baavjood ye log sabha kar rahe the
 So they have been detained
 jyaan drej ke samarthakon kaa aarope he ki police in teenon se kisi ko milane nahin de rahi he
 The police are also not explaining why Jean Dreze and his associates have been detained
 jyaan drej ne kuch maheene pehle jharkhand main kiya tha bada khulasagauratlab he ki jyaan drej ne kuch maheene pehle jharkhand main jin logon kaa aadhaar se pension, rashan card, job card link nahin hua he, vaise labhaarthiyon ko laabh se vanchit kiye jane kaa khulaasa kiya tha
 In Jharkhand, job cards, ration cards or pensioners are described as fake, and the amount left in this head is being looted by the government itself as Aadhaar Enabled Saving
 itnaa hi nahin jharkhand main aadhaar card se link nahin hone ke kaaran hajaaron job card bhi cancil kar die gaye hai
 Jean Dreze had revealed that in 2017, the Modi government said that it saved Rs 100 crore due to Aadhaar, but the information received from RTI showed that the Jharkhand government canceled the ration card by showing fake ration cards, in which 12% Were wrong
 iske kaaran jaruratmandon ko unke rashan ke adhikaar se vanchit ho janaa padaa tha
 Book: The Gods of Global Village Author: Ranendra Prakash: Indian Gyanpeeth Price: Rs 70 Today everyone is talking about making the world a village
 ek global gaanv
 But the real villages that are in the race to make the world a village, we are failing to maintain those villages
 gaanv vilupt hote ja rahe hai or ham vishwa ko global gaanv main badalane kii baat karte hai
 If both the joy of building the shelter and the fear of its breakdown are at the peak, then the emotions are at the highest ebb
 vikaas kii andhi daud main sabane apane-apane paimaane tay kiye hai
 Building factories and paved buildings for a big company or government is development, but for anyone it is a scene of destruction
 insaan apana chota ghar banaata he, usamen jindagi ke do pal khushiyon ke saath bitaata he
 But sometimes some people have to pay the price of other's happiness by sacrificing their happiness
 madhyapradesh, jharkhand, chhattisgarh, odisha, bihar, pashchim bengal or desh ke baaki rajyon main rahane vaale adivaasiyon kii khushi twitor par folover yaa fasebuk par daali jane vaali selfi par nirbhar nahin karti
 Their happiness is fulfilled by their settling in tribal areas on their terms or fulfilling basic needs in the world
 global gaanv ke devtaa kitaab ke jariye lekhak ranendra ne ek behad jaruri or haashie par khadey logon kii baat rakhane kaa saraahneey kadam uthaaya he
 The posting of a self-proclaimed mother of a schoolteacher takes place amidst the forest-mines atop a mountain, away from the city
 bhunrapat ek aisa ilaaka jahaan boxite kii mining saalon se lagaataar ho rahi he
 In the name of development, the sacrifice has to be given only to the poor
 iske badale use milti he khud kii hi dhone vaali jindagi
 Naturally, the newly appointed teacher initially found the tribal area boring, but the author has done well to explain the situation there to the readers through the book's main narrator
 asur:adivaasiyon kii ek jati asur ke bare main ranendra ne kitaab main aam logon kii dharna ko saamne rakhaa he
 Ranendra writes in the book, 'my impression about the Asuras was that there would be very long, wide, dark-skinned, terrible, tooth-borne, horns on their foreheads
 ‚Äô lekin kitaab ke kirdaar ‚Äòlaalachan ko jaanakar sab ulat-pulat ho rahaa tha
 All the childhood stories were reversing
 ‚Äôadivasee ilaakon ke vikaas kii sachai:badi-badi companiyaan munafa kamaane kii hode main adivasee gaanvon main khanan kaam teji se karti hai
 Describing the plight of such villages, Ranendra has written in the book, 'in the last 25-30 years, the big pits which the mine owners have left, in the rainy season, these pits are flooded and mosquitoes breed
 mahamari failati he
 People die ‚Äô adivasee ilaakon main companiyaan gadde to kar detii hai yaa apni jaruraton ke hisaab se sthaneey logon ko visthapit kar detii hai, par jab uski bharpai kii baari aati he to companiyaan saalon khamosh rahanaa pasand karti hai
 Siyani Women: Regarding the women of tribal villages, Ranendra writes, 'women were called Siyani in this society, not Janani
 janaani shabd kahin na kahin keval janan, janm dene kii prakriya tak unhen sankuchit karata, jabaki ciyaani shabd unki vishesh samajhadaari-sayaanepan kii ore ingit karata maaloom hota
 'even after this, the Gods of Global Village used these Sianis for their needs and wishes
 ciyaani mahilaon ke devataaon ke aage jhuk jane kii vajah unki majaburi thi
 Superstition: Superstition is spread in the roots of India
 kitaab samaaj main faile andhvishwaas ko ujagar karne main bhi safal sabit hoti he, kitaab main andhvishwaas kaa ek kissa kuch yun he, ‚Äòdarasal, ab bhi kuch logon ke man main yah baat baithi hui he ki dhan ko aadmi ke khun main saanakar bichada daalane se fasal bahut acchhee hoti he
 So Mudikatwa people roam around in this season
 ‚Äô ranendra ne kitaab ke jariye gaanv kinare aakar based shivadas baba ke vistaar or ladakiyon ke prati unke vishesh sneh par bakhubi jaruri or maarak tanj kiya he
 Why not read the gods of Global Village, if you do not like to read a book written on a serious subject, then this book is not for you
 chunki kitaab main metro shaharon se hatakar adivasee logon kii baat kahi gai he
 In such a situation, if you are not into serious reading, then the book can make you bored
 kitaab ke kuch hisson main adivasee ilaakon kii sthaneey bhashaaon kaa istemaal kiya gaya he
 In such a situation, you may have to work hard to understand some expressions
 kitaab lagaatar baandhakar rakhane main bhi kai jagah vifal rahati he
 In other words, this book is for serious readers
 ham kyon padhein is kitaab ko
 
 
 The book narrates an issue in 100 pages, which you may have to try hard to know
 kitaab vikaas ke maanakon or adivasee samasya kaa sundarataa baratate hue gambhir chithran karti he
 If you want to understand the scope of your thinking and the pain and problem of large population of the country, then you will get complete honesty in this book
 jise gambhir padhanaa acha lagata he, ranendra ke global gaanv ke devtaa aise pathakon kii ichha jarur puraa karenge
 Although the doctor has been considered the most sacred profession in our world, but in the meantime the situation has completely reversed
 praathmik chikitsa centre se lekar bade-bade aspataalon tak se aisi khabaren aksar aati hai ki doctoron ne kis tarah kotahiyaan baratin
 How he rounded up all the medicines he received from the government
 kis tarah ve apane job ke prati eemaandaar nahin rahete
 At the same time, the talk of dental surgeon Ankita Chandra in Delhi's much awaited Safdarjung Hospital is different
 vah paanch dinon tak to safadarajang aspataal, supreme court or dilli main kendriya swasthya evam parivaar kalyaan mantralay kii kuch dispenceriyon main bhi marijon kii dekhbhaal to karti hai
 Apart from this, on Saturday and Sunday holidays, he can be seen visiting the villages around Delhi and treating the teeth of the people in Muft
 gaanvon main daure se jaani vahaan kii hakeekat
 
 
 Dr
 Ankita studied BDS from West Bengal
 vahaan padhai ke dauraan unhen har saal dental camp ke liye gramin ilaakon main le jaaya jaataa tha
 She says that in cities, people are a little aware of teeth, but in villages the conditions are terrible
 rahi-sahi kasar vahaan aasaani se milane valepan-supaarior kheni jaise nashile padaarth puri kar dete hai
 During this time, he took up the responsibility of making people aware
 upiessi or shaadi kii vajah se muhim kii raftaar hui dhimi
 
 
 After becoming a doctor, Dr
 Ankita started preparing for UPSC
 isi dauraan unki shaadi bhi ho gai
 After marriage, she started working for the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare
 wo bataati hai kisarkaari karmchaarito apane ilaaj kaa kharch uthaa liya karte the lekin un marijon kaa kya jo aarthik rup se sampann nahin hai
 The picture she shows from the figures mirror is even more frightening
 shaharon main doctoron kii bharmaar he
 There is 1 dental surgeon present in 15 thousand people, whereas in rural areas only 1 dental surgeon is available for a population of more than 1 lakh
 gaanv-gaanv jane ke alaava chalaati hai muft clinics
 
 
 Dr
 Ankita is not only spreading awareness about dental health among the people by going village to village, but she has also established an clinic in Gurgaon for the financially weak
 yahaan muft main buudhe or garib logon kaa ilaaj or unako dawaaen di jaati hai
 Currently, Dr
 Ankita and her team are working in 11 states including Delhi, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand, Gujarat, Maharashtra
 vah ab tak 25 hajaar se zyada logon ke daanton kii jaanch kar chuki he
 Doctor Ankita's medical team often consists of 6 people
 jisamen 3 doctor or 3 walantier hote hai
 Looking at Dr
 Ankita, now many other dental surgeons also want to make a similar positive effort in the rural areas around them
 iske liye ve doctor ankitha se sampark bhi sadhate hai

 india retings and research (fich samooh) main mukhya arthshaastri devendra kumaar pant ne kaha, 'pehali timahi main tex collection pichley varsh ke tex rifund ke kaaran prabhavit hua he, lekin vruddhi dar kii maujuuda chaal kaa tex collection par ek asar hoga
 Income tax and central GST collection growth rates are relatively better, but the growth rate of corporate tax collections is showing the first quarter corporate results
 'unhone kaha ki kul milakar yadi khapat main susti ko tatkaal palata nahin gaya, to sarkaar ke liye vitt varsh 2020 ke rajkoshiya ghate ko hasil karnaa ek kathin kaary hoga
 Definition of fiscal deficit: In a country, government earns revenue through sources such as tax
 saath hi sarkaar kharch bhi karti he
 When the total expenditure of the government exceeds its total revenue, the government has to borrow additional amount from the market
 yah raashi jo sarkaar udhaar leti he vah rajkoshiya ghate ke baraabar hoti he
 In simple language, the difference between the total revenue and expenditure of the government is called fiscal deficit

 ' Just before the start of the winter session, the central government has revised the CSAT exam pattern of UPSC
 ravivaar ko sarvadaleey baithak ke dauraan sarkaar ne sabhi dalon se main paksh-vipaksh ke sabhi pahaluon par vichaar maange hai
 Union Minister M

 Significantly, in the last session of Parliament, the issue of C-SAT had raised a lot
 iske kaaran donon sadanon kii kaarywahi kai baar baadhit hui thi or usase pehle dilli samet desh ke kai shaharon main pariksha pattern ko lekar hinsak bavaal bhi hua tha
 It is clear that before the winter session of Parliament began, the government wanted all parties to have an opinion on this issue
 sansad ke pichley bajet satr main sarkaar kii ore se die gaye aashwaasan kii disha main aage kaam karte hue naidu ne ravivaar ko baithak bulaai thi
 The meeting was attended by Home Minister Rajnath Singh, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, Minister of State in the Prime Minister's Office Jitendra Singh, Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Rajiv Pratap Rudy and Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi
 baithak main singh or naidu ne kaha ki si-sat kaa mudda samvedansheel he or sarkaar sabhi dalon ke vichaaron kaa laabh uthaanaa chaahegi
 The political parties participating in the meeting include Congress, Left parties, Trinamool Congress, JDU, RJD, Samajwadi Party and BSP

 As the Delhi Police arrested 24-year-old Ravindra from the Sukhbir Nagar area of delhi for raping and killing a 6-year-old girl, during interrogation, a shocking revelation was revealed to him, after hearing that His senses also flew away
 aisa isliye kyonki jise wo abhi tak mahaj ek repist samaj rahi thi, darasal wo ek aisa darinda niklaa jo pehle to bacchon ko bahala-phuslaa kar unka apharan karata tha phir unki saath rape ke baad hatya kar detaa tha
 June 5, 2014: In an attempt to murder a six-year-old child, the police of Jelbegampur police station arrested Ravindra and his friend Dharmendra on June 6, 2014, for six-year-old rape and attempted murder
 bachche kii maa ne bataaya ki uske chah saal ke bete ko raat main ghar se agava kiya gaya
 The child was recovered from an empty house tank in the neighborhood
 uskaa galaa reta hua tha
 The police admitted the child to the hospital
 14 july 2015: chah saal kii maasoom kii rape kar phenki lashasubah kareeb saadhe nau baje 9:30 baje begumpur thana police ko soochna mili ki ilaake se chah saal kii ek bacchee gaayab he
 The girl's family told the police that the girl had gone for defecation outside the house in the morning but since then she has no address
 tafteesh ke dauraan police ko paas ke ek makaan ke shaft main bacchee kii laash mili
 The driver's license and some other papers of a boy named Sunny were also recovered from the corpse
 kagajaton kii baramadagi ke saath hi police ko laga ki usne cese ko sulajhaa liya he
 When the police reached her house while searching for Sunny, she herself was shocked
 police ko pataa chalaa ki sanni ke saath uske doston rabindra or sunil ne marpet kii thi or ravindra ne sanni se uskaa driving license or paise bhi chin liye the
 When the police raided Ravindra's house, it was found that he had been missing since the morning of 14 July
 police ne ravindra ke mobile phone se uski lokation tres kii or usko bahari dilli ke hi sukhvir nagar ilaake se giraftaar kar liya
 The murder of 15 children in Delhi, UP, when the police started questioning him, he was also shocked
 ravindra ne police ko bataaya ki wo dilli or uttar pradesh main rape or katl kii pandrah se zyada vaardaaton ko anjaam de chukaa he
 He told that he would either kidnap the sleeping children from the house and then take them to an isolated place and kill them first and then rape them
 kai vaardaaton main usne pehle bacchon ko toffee, chocolate yaa paisa dene ke bahaane phuslaaya or phir sunsaan jagah le jaakar unke saath dushkarm kiya tha
 Most of the slum children were targeted at him
 sharaab ke nashe main diya saare vaardaat ko anjaambakaul rabindra usne in sabhi vaardaaton ko sharaab ke nashe main anjaam diya he
 But seeing the manner in which he has carried out all the incidents, he feels that he did not have any fear of the law and that he would carry out a new incident on the day when his head was obsessed and then with the clutches of the law
 With the help of erasing the mark of his crime, he would have brutally killed those innocent people
 philhal yeshaatir psycopath kanoon kii giraft mena chukaa he lekin police sutron kii maane to unhen ye lagata he ki rabindra khud ko bachaane ke liye ab bhi unase jhooth bol rahaa he
 Living cleanly is a habit
 aamtaur par log ghar kii safai mehmaanon ke liye karte hai
 There are very few people who clean the house keeping in mind their health
 lekin saaf-suthere ghar main rahane kii ek bahut badi vajah saamne ai he
 According to a study, staying in a dirty and messy house affects fertility
 adhyayan ke mutabik, gande or bikhare hue ghar main rahane se banjhapan kii ashanka kaaphi bad jaati he
 Actually, the dust particles present in the house contain many toxic chemicals
 iske alaava gande ghar main rahane se cancer kaa khatra bhi bad jaataa he
 Hazardous phthalates are present in almost everything everyday
 food package, hair spray, cosmetics, sabun in sabhi chizon kaa istemaal ham regular karte hai or inamen maujuud rasayan asthma ausharli menopause kaa kaaran ban sakate hai
 When we use these things, the chemicals present in them dissolve in the air and after that dust particles get mixed and spread in the house
 yahi dhul ke kan ghar kii chizon, farsh, khaane kii chizon par jaakar baithte hai
 Scientists at George Washington University have found many such hazardous chemicals in the dust particles present in the house
 vaigyanikon kaa kahana he ki jab ham saans lete hai to ghar main maujuud ye dhul ke kan hamaari naak main chale jate hai
 Although the follicles present in the nose work to filter them, despite this, some particles enter the body
 ye dhul ke kansehat par bura asar daalate hai
 Study head Amy Jota says that these dangerous dust mites in the home are the most harmful to children
 aise bahut se adhyayan aa chuke hai jinamein gande ghar ko bimariyon kaa ghar bataaya gaya he lekin ye apni tarah kaa pehla adhyayan he jisamen gandagi ko banjhapan se jodakar dekha gaya he
 In such a situation, if you have been wavering about cleanliness till now, then be careful
 kahin ghar kii ye gandagi aapse aapaki sabase badi khushi hi na chin le
 4 days have passed, Delhi facing the emergency level of pollution
 ummid jataai ja rahi he ki shanivaar yaa ravivaar ko barish se pradooshan kaa str sudhar jayega
 Grap action plans such as biomass burnings and dust control are already in place
 sipisibi ne guuruuvaar GRAP TASK FORCE kii meeting main paaya ki beete dino main jab dilli immergency kii haalat se guzar rahi he tab piem 10 ke mukaable piem 2
 Level 5 has become more dangerous
 beete 4 dinon se immergency jaise halaat kaa kaaran 31 disambar or pehali taarikh ko lagane vaale jam kii vajah se petrol-dijal zyada jaale
 It may take time for these small particles to settle
 mausam main taapmaana or nami kam hone se ye chote kan or bhi nahin fail pate
 The Meteorological Department has hoped that there will be good rainfall on Saturday
 lihaaja ye kan dhul jaaenge or logon ko pradooshan se nijaat milegi
 It may also take a week
 logon ko salaah bhi he ki laal batti par ingine band kar den, gaadi kam se kam chalaaen
 The number of trains, slowing down of trains due to road encroachment is also a major cause of pollution

 niti ayog ne behatar vetan or ucch utpaadak rojgaar ko badhaava dene par jor dete hue kaha he ki desh ke samaksh berogari ke bajaae gambhir arddh-berogari sabase badi samasya he
 The three-year work agenda for the years 2017-18 to 2019-20 states that in fact unemployment is a less important problem for India
 iske bajaae adhik gambhir samasya gambhir arddh-berogari he
 According to the report, the need of the hour is to create jobs with higher productivity and better wages
 ayog ne haal main jari apni teen saal kii kaary yojana main kaha ki aayaat pratisthaapan ranneeti ke jariye gharelu bazaar par dhyaan dene se saapekshik rup se laghu companiyon ko aage badhane main madad milegi
 Significantly, if a person does not work for a whole week and earns less than a certain amount of money then such situation is called semi-unemployment
 ise bhi padhein: 25 lakh nae rojgaar lekar aayega GST, adhyayan se ai baat samnedesh main rojgaar viheen vruddhi ke daawey ke vipareet rashtriya namoona survey karyaalay eneseso ke rojgaar-berozegaar survey main baar-baar kaha jaataa rahaa he ki teen dashak se adhik samay se desh main berogari kii dar kam or sthir he
 But in order to create high-paying jobs in the Indian market, it is important that the economy needs to emphasize production in the country through import subsidies
 dakshin korea, taiwan, singapore or china jaise pramukh vinirmaan deshon kaa udhaaharan dete hue isamen kaha gaya he, vaishvik bazaar ke liye vinirmaan ke jariye mek in india abhiyaan ko safal banane kii jarurat he
 The report noted that wages are rising in China due to an aging workforce and many large-scale labor-intensive sectors are manufacturing companies looking for low-wage jobs

 ham yah to dekhte hai ki automation se koun se naukariyaan khatm hui lekin ham yah nahin dekh sakate hai ki vastav main automation se kis prakaar kii naukariyaan srujit hongi
 Also read: America will have to take to create cashless economy Subakpanagadia insisted from India that never in history has it been seen that the advancement of technology has led to job cuts
 unhone kaha, yah ham sabhi ko adhik vyast banaata he or audyogic deshon main jahaan automation hai log zyada vyast hai
 On the question related to the issue of protectionism, he said that he has his own opinion that the global market is very big
 panagadhiya ne kaha ki udhaaharan ke liye vastu niryaat bazaar 17,000 arab dollars kaa he
 Service exports range from 5,000 to 6,000 dollars
 is tarah kul 22,000 arab dollars kaa niryaat bazaar he
 He said that it is so large that hardly there will be any adverse effect of protectionism and even if it happens, countries can try to gain a larger share of business individually
 panagadhiya ne kaha ki bharat iskaa ek acha udhaaharan he
 Its share in commodity exports is only 1
 7 fisadi he
 Now the relevance of the decline in the size of this type of market is no more than that in the case of India, its share in this market is 1
 7 fisadi se badhaakar chaar yaa paanch pratishat kar saktaa he
 Pangarhia said,
 
 
 
 In my view, instead of technology, ultimately the implementation of leadership and their policies and better governance will determine the future of countries

 Jagdeep Dhankhare, who took over as the Governor of West Bengal barely two months ago, has created a stir in the political and administrative circles here due to his proactive work style
 sattarudh trinmul congress kaa maananaa he ki ve ek 'rajnatik agenda' ke tahat kaam karte hue apni simaaon kaa atikaraman kar rahe hai
 But the unshakeable Dhankhar from this attack is committed to protect the constitution and work for the welfare of the people
 romita dattako die unke saakshaatkaar ke ansh:aapane aise samay kaarybhaar sambhala he jab pashchim bengal main rajnatik uttejnaa chai he or rajya trinmul congress tathaa bhaajapa ke bich ek rassakashi main fansaa hua he
 How do you see your role in these situations? It is a challenging obligation
 par mere kaam kii simaaen samvidhan se tay hongi
 i have taken an oath to serve the people of Bengal
 iske raste main koi baadha nahin aegi
 i will face challenges with fear and enthusiasm
 aap ke saamne kisi chunautiyaan hai?meraa sanvaidhanik daayitv he ki samaaj ke kamjor virgon ko laabh pahunchane ke liye bani kendriya yojanaon kii sthiti kaa akalan karun
 If there is a need to warn the state or central government in this regard, i will
 main rajya or yahaan ke logon ko behatar tareeke se jaanane ke liye jilon kaa daura karuunga
 As Chancellor of various universities of the state, i am seriously concerned about the educational environment of the state
 agar main bengal main kuch chijen sudhaarna chahta hum, to, isamen buraai kya he?aalochakon kaa daawa he ki amit shah ne aapako bengal main kisi 'khaas kaam' ke liye khaas taur par chunaa tha
 i have only one agenda - not to go out of my oath of office and not to engage in other activities
 kya aap ek bhi maukey kaa zikr kar sakati hai jab maine lakshmana rekha langhi ho? anya sabhi prayaas kar lene ke baad jadavapur vishvavidhyalay jaakar (campus main kendriya mantri babul supriyo ke saath khinchataan kii ghatana ke baad 19 sitambar ko) halaat ko shant karne ke mere prayaas main siyaasi kya tha? meri suraksha khatre main padi
 Where is politics in the desire to see Bengal again at the top? The ruling party has serious objections to your comments and activities
 sarkaar ke ek mantri ne suzav diya he ki aapako rajya ke paryaton sthalon kaa daura karnaa chahie, na ki jilon kaa
 The Chief Minister has not said anything about this even once
 mere man main unke prati bahut sammaan he
 But they have allowed the blunt people to create an intolerable environment
 yah durbhagyapurna he ki koi mananeey mantri rajyapal kii bhoomika ko paryatak tak simit rakhane jaisi ghatiya soch rakhe
 this is outrageous
 aap rajya main kanoon-vyavastha kii sthiti kaa akalan kaisaa karte hai? yahaan rajnatik hatyaein hui hai
 West Bengal is under the shadow of a kind of fear
 sarkaar ne jis tarah meri maujuudagi‚Äîchaahe vah silligudi main ho yaa phir kolkata ke durgapuja meley main‚Äîke prati ashishnutaa kaa pradarshan kiya he or jis tarah se media ne rajya ke pratham sevak ke apmaan par chuppi saadhe rakhi, vah sanket karata he ki bhay kaa vaataavaran he or media kaa munh band kiya ja rahaa he
 It is shameful to have political killings because it is contrary to democratic principles and should be dealt with appropriately
 rajyapal-mukhyamantri sameekaran to kisi shityudh se kam nahin he
 i would still like to see Mamata Banerjee as my best friend in Bengal

 When it comes to love stories in Bollywood, Salman Khan and Aishwarya Rai's name definitely comes
 haalanki kabhi diwaanon kii tarah ek duusare ko chaahane vaale ye star ab ek duusare kii shakl tak dekhnaa pasand nahin karte hai
 After all, what happened in a love story that created such a huge wall of hatred? Was it because of the entry of a third person or is it the growth of love? Such questions kept increasing year after year, but only one story came out in the answer - Salman did a comment on the trailer of 'ae Dil Hai Mushkil', which started Lavastoribat Hai in 1999
 is saal salmaan or aishwarya raay kii film ham dil de chuke sanam relies hui thi
 The chemistry of the two in the film was so amazing that the effect of their real life love was evident in the reel life too
 haalanki sanjay lila bhansaali vaise bhi apni filmon main kirdaaron ko itani khubsuurati se pesh karte hai ki pyaar na bhi ho, to kam se kam darshakon ko to us jodi se pyaar ho hi jaataa he
 The latest examples of this are Ranveer Singh and Deepika Padukone
 phir bhi kahana hoga ki aishwarya or salmaan kii lav chemistry ne sanjay lila bhansaali kii film ham dil de chuke sanam ko kaaphi phayda pahunchaaya tha
 Then in Hum Tumhare Hain Sanam, Aishwarya also played cameo but Salman Khan's girlfriend
 donon main kaaphi nazdikiyaan badhane lageen
 Aishwarya also got a good bond with Salman Khan's family
 vah aksar unke paariwarik aayojanon main bhi najar aane lageen
 Aishwarya also got along with Salman's sister Arpita and Alvira
 is sabake baavjood ek vakt aisa aayaa, jab donon kaa brallep ho gaya
 When the actor was confronted with Salman Khan over Aishwarya, the actor tried to suicide that Salman reached Aishwarya's apartment in 2001 and kept knocking at the door
 bataaya jaataa he ki unhone ye dhamkee tak di thi ki agar aish ne darwaja nahin kholaa, to wo aatmahatya kar lenge
 He wanted a promise to marry Ash
 jabaki aish shaadi karne kii jaldi main nahin thim
 After this, Salman had said in an interview, 'you fight only with those you love
 'padmavati ke liye haa kar chuke the salmaan or aishwarya, lekin
 
 
 Salmanfir went to meet Somi Ali without telling Ash, the turning point, which ended Salman and Ash's relationship forever
 ye tab hua jab salmaan apni eks garlfriend somi ali kii madad karne ke liye america gaye
 He did not even tell Ash about it
 shahrukh kaa collar tak pakad liyasaal 2002 main ye saaf ho gaya ki donon ke bich brallep ho gaya he
 This was the time when Salman started interfering in Aishwarya's professional life too
 us dauraan chalate-chalate film kii shooting ho rahi thi
 The film had Shah Rukh and Aishwarya in the lead roles
 magar tabhi salmaan film ke set par pahunche or aish ko ghasitate hue vahaan se le gaye
 He suspected that Ash and Shah Rukh had an affair, while there was nothing like it
 unhone gusse main shahrukh kaa collar tak pakad liya thaaishwarya, abhishek or salmaan kaa ye video ho rahaa he viralais vajah se aish ke haath se wo film chali gai
 Rani Mukherjee later got this role
 iske baad kuch intervyuuj main aishwarya ne yahaan tak kaha ki salmaan khan unki jindagi kaa sabase bura hissaa the
 He is happy that he got rid of this relationship in time

 Despite being given a befitting reply to the cross-border shelling, Pakistan is not deterring its antics

 After some time, this deadly team carried out a counter-attack such as during a surgical strike
 palak jhapakate hi commandos ne aatankiyon par grenade se hamalaa kiya
 a rapid firing with smoke grenades was carried out as the chaos spread
 dekhte hi dekhte 38 aatankwaadiyon ko dher kar diya tha

 The commanding officer of the unit posted at the forward post told us that the situation has changed since the surgical strike
 hamen apane aalaa adhikariyon se ground par dushman ke khilaaf aakraamak karrwai karne kii puri chhot he
 During the night, the soldiers of the deadly platoon of the army move fully alert
 petroling tukdi badi saavdhaanee ke saath aage badhati he kyonki dushman kabhi bhi nishaanaa laga saktaa he
 The soldiers are instructed by the company commander that the situation is hot on the outskirts
 dushman iskaa phayda uthaa saktaa he
 There is a need to be more vigilant in this situation sena pramukh general bipin ravat ne ajtak se khaas baatcheet main kaha tha ki maujuuda halaat main bharat-paak sarhad par ek or sargical strike kii jarurat he
 On the completion of two years of surgical strikes, whatever the terrorists try on the loc with the help of Pakistani Army, they will not be able to succeed in their nefarious plans
 (cameraman anil jaiswal ke saath) When the police raided here on Thursday night after receiving news about the casino, which is running in a form house in Vasant Kunj, Delhi, the Mahafil was getting very little

 vasant kunj ke is casino ke saath khaas baat ye thi ki is casino ke maalik ne graahakon ko khush karne ke liye husn-shabaab kaa intjaam bhi kar rakhaa tha
 This is the reason that when the police raided here, along with three customers and four Karinds, four such girls were found who worked in the same casinos

 Those who were fond of placing bets in casinos would use their mobile phones to establish rabta with gambling businessmen

 bhartiya team ke coach ravi shastri ne kaha ki vartmaan team shikaayat karne main vishwaas nahin rakhti
 She will not excuse the difficult conditions for her performance during the five-match Test series against England

 Prashant Bhushan, appearing on behalf of the petitioner, argued that the amendment opened the doors for unlimited political donations from foreign companies and thus legalized the financial contributions received from foreign sources
 yachikakarta chahta he ki sanshodhan radd ho jaae
 Earlier the law did not allow foreign donations to political parties but amendments to the law exempted political parties and allowed them to receive foreign funds with retrospective effect

 Was this money used to buy votes? The Election Commission continued to do the work of catching money by putting barricades on the streets, the money kept reaching through the thief paths made by the law
 kisne paise liye, kis par karch kiye gaye? kis party kaa koun bika or kis mohalle ke koun se log bik gaye? bagair in sawaalon ke jawaab ke loksabhaa kii jeet kaa koi bhi vishleshan adhuraa he
 useless

 Never before has there been such a concrete way to deliver money
 jaanch zaruri he ki elactoral bond kaa paisa kisne bhunaaya, kahaan jamaa karaayaa or kis par kharch kiya
 The will power and moral strength of such investigation is not in any officer
 kisi sanstha main nahin he
 The Election Commission has also admitted that the electoral bonds are not transparent, but the role of the Commission itself is questionable
 shaq se pare nahin he
 This is not ordinary news
 kareeb paanch hazaar karod ke bond bike hai
 Of these, more than 80- 90 per cent of the bonds are being mentioned in the bjp's share
 is silsile main kai media report mil jaaengi
 What will you read? What can be the story of 370 crore electoral bonds from one branch in Bengal? One can only tell James Bond
 bharat main bond yug aa gaya he
 Bond knows everything
 baaki sab us bond ke bandhua hai

 subrat roy kaa naam desh kii un hastiyon main shumaar he, jise paise se paisa banane main maharath hasil he
 But as soon as he came to the Supreme Court on Tuesday, all his mastery went in vain
 20 hajaar karod rupee kii dendaree ke maamle main supreme court ko naaraaz karne vaale or dusron ko sahaara dene kaa dam bharne vaale subrat roy ko tab kanoon kaa bhi sahaara naa mila
 Subrata Roy is a resort of 1
2 million families
 netaa hon yaa abhinayta sabhi ko apni daulat kii hanak dikhaanaa, jisaki adaa he
 Prove himself to be the biggest patriot of the country, whose biggest is Gurur
 lekin usee subrat roy ke saath supreme court parisar main jo kuch hua uske bare main shaayad hi unhone kabhi sochaa hoga
 Subrata Roy Sahara's face turned black as soon as he reached the door of the country's largest court
 shaayad unki jindagi kaa sabase kaala din yahi tha jab adaalat ke baahar unke chehre par syaahi phenki gai or adaalat ke bheetar unke kirdaar par
 Even before Gusse arrived before the largest court of independence, a man named Manoj Sharma threw ink on Subrata Roy's face says that Roy is a thief of the poor and he fights a war against thieves
 darasas ye gusse kii wo kaalikh he jo sidhe subrat roy sahaara ke daaman kii bajaay unke chehre par giri
 This anger was about breaking trust, this anger was on lying, and perhaps this anger was also about playing the eyes with the law
 haalanki subrat roy apane chehre se syaahi ponchhate hue aage nikal gaye lekin manoj camere ke saamne ruk gaya
 The supporters who came with Subrata Roy lashed out at the ink-throwing person and tore his clothes
 lekin ab subrat roy is kaali syaahi ko apane chehre se kitna bhi saaf karen
 These stains will continue to stain their status
 haisiyat ko karaari chotlakhanau main subrat roy kii aaleeshaan kothi he
 It is also one of the few palatial houses in the pride of Lucknow, which are proud of the Nawabs
 lekin kanoon ke saamne sabhi baraabar hai
 Subrata Roy's glory came loose when proceedings started in the court at 2 pm on Tuesday
 pehle to subrat roy ne bina shart court se maafee maangi
 But Subrata Roy, who is boasting of his glory, has been sent directly to Tihar by the Supreme Court ultimatum, where he is to remain till March 11
 unki rihaai pehle bhi ho sakati he basharte rupee vaapasi kaa thos plan wo adaalat ko bataaen
 Last February 28, when the convoy of cars opened on the way to the court after opening the doors of this kothi, no one had any idea that this journey would now continue till Tihar in Delhi
 mahaj chaar dinon main subrat roy sahaara ke liye duniya, daravaaje or dahalij sab kuch badal gaya
 Subram Roy's lawyer Ram Jethmalani argued that his property was worth 28 thousand crores
 sebi ise bech de to vah paisa lautaa denge
 The court asked why Sebi should do all this
 ye aapkaa kaam he kisi or kaa nahin
 The court also said that Subrata Roy could have done the same thing if he wanted, but he did not do so
 court ne aage kaha, 'aap lagaataar agast 2012 ke hamaare aadesh kaa ulanghan karte rahe
 We have seen your bank account, in which you have shown a transaction of thousands of crores, then remove it from it
 ' is par subrat roy ke vakil ne kaha ki unke paas abhi cash main aisa paisa nahin he jo ve de saken to court ne bhi kaha ki aapako bahut mauka de diya, lekin aapane uski parvaah nahin kii
 Subrata Roy's passion is not less, Subrata Roy was fond of film and cricket since childhood
 unke isi shauk ne unhen bhartiya cricket team kaa 'sahaara' bana diya, vahiin bade-bade filmi sitare unka ek 'sahaara' paane ko tarasate the
 Alam was that at the behest of his finger, even the biggest star started playing in front of him
 dekhte hi dekhte subrat roy aise empire ke maalik ban baithe jiskaa sapana bhi dekhnaa logon ko sapane jaisi baat lagati he
 Business of Tata, Birla, Ambani on one side, Sahara's shan-o-shaukat on one side
 shaayad hi aisa koi filmi sitara he shaayad hi aisa koi cricketer he jo sahaara kii chamak damak se dur rahaa ho
 
 
 
 tab amitabh ko diya tha 'sahaara'saal 2000 kii baat he
 Amitabh Bachchan's stardom was on the rise
 unki company katghare main thi or sadi kaa superstar akelaa tha
 Subrata Roy then had his favorite star overcome the crisis

 It is another matter that Sahara's logo was removed from Team India's jersey due to a spat with BCCI in recent times
 lekin khel ke jariye sahaara ek alag hi tarah ke rashtrawaad kaa paryaay ban gaya
 Patriot Subrata Roy told himself that his business thinking is based on patriotism

 " After 28 years, the state has once again started a controversy over the statue of Manu in Rajasthan High Court Jaipur
 rajya ke mahila or dalit sanghathanon ne manu kii pratimaa ko hoicourt se hataane ke liye rajyabar main andolan kaa elaan kar diya he
 Meanwhile, the Rajasthan government has deployed a heavy force outside the statue of Manu in the High Court
 sabaki suraksha kii guarantee dene vaale court ke andar manu kii is pratimaa ko khatra paidaa ho gaya he
 More than two hundred policemen have been deployed to protect the statue of this Manu in the Rajasthan High Court
 isaki vajah ye he ki rajya ke 20 se zyada dalit or mahila sanghathanon ne elaan kiya he ki hoicourt jaipur ke andar lage is manu kii pratimaa ko hataane ke liye rajyabar main andolan shuru kiya jaae
 They say that in the shadow of the statue of Manu who has said objectionable things about women and caste system, how can the High Court give fair judgment
 manu kii is pratimaa ko hataane ko lekar pichley 28 saalon se rajasthan hoicourt main maamla chal rahaa he lekin abhi tak koi bhi sunwaayee thik se nahin ho paa rahi he
 Therefore, all women and Dalit organizations have also sought time to meet the Chief Justice of Rajasthan
 saamaajik kaaryakarta kavita shrivastav kaa kahana he is maamle ko 28 saal se jaanboojhkar court main taala ja rahaa he
 We demand that the court should take the decision quickly so that either the statue of Manu is removed or we go to the Supreme Court

 lekin tabhi hindu mahasabha kii taraf se acharya dharmendra manu kii pratimaa hataane ke khilaaf hoicourt main ste kii yachika laga di ki ek baar sthapit murti hataai nahin ja sakati
 Since then, the case has been heard only twice
 jab bhi sunwaayee hoti he court parisar main takaraav kaa vaataavaran ban jaataa he or maamla band kar diya jaataa he
 Hindu organizations are opposing the removal of Manmu's statue
 yachikakarta acharya dharmendra kaa kahana he ki pratimaa kisi bhi tarah se hataanaa anuchit he
 Manu is given the status of God in the scriptures
 is maamle main court ne grih vibhaag ke sachiv ke jarie notice bhejkar bharat sarkaar ko bhi pakshakaar banane ko kaha tha lekin maamle kii samvedansheeltaa ko dekhte hue sarkaar khud ko is vivaad se dur rakhe hue he

 The surprising thing is that the person has left a suicide note in the name of bjp's PM candidate Narendra Modi
 police ke mutabik, usne modi se apni beti kii dekhbhaal karne kii vinati kii he
 The person has been identified as Om Prakash Tiwari
 vah loni ilaake main parivaar ke saath rahe the

 i beg you to take care of my baby girl after my death
 'apane ek panne ke suicide note main omprakash ne yah bhi likhaa he ki uski maut ke liye koi jimmedaar nahin he

 10 secret recorded in these
 
 
 netaji subhash chandra bose inquairi cameti kii 11 sitambar1956 kii reportmen kaha gaya tha ki netaji kii maut 18 agast 1945 ko plane krash main hui
 When the defeat of Japan began to appear certain, Netaji made preparations to go to Russia
 vah 16 agast 1945 ko plane se bangkok se manchuriya ke liye nikal gaye
 The plane crashed in Kothaioku on 18 August and Netaji was badly burned
 unhen usee raat taihoku hospital main bhartee karaayaa gaya, par bachaaya na ja sakaa
 He was cremated in Taihoku itself
 asthiyaan sitambar main tokyo laai gayi or rankoji mandir main rakhi gayi
 Witnesses saw their clothes burning
 patni or beti kii file main pej nan
 It is written on 3 - AICC used to send Rs 6000 annually to Netaji's daughter till 1964
 yah silsilaa 1965 main uski shaadi ke baad rukaa
 Netaji's wife did not want any money
 isliye sarkaar ne unhen kisi tarah kii koi rakam nahin bheji
 These were Netaji's last words: 'tell people that i fought for the independence of my country till the last breath
 unhen yah ladaai jari rakhni he or mujhe puraa bharosa he ki bharat jald hi aaazaad ho jayega
 Now no one can keep India as a slave
 'bakaul cameti isliye hua maut par shakauameti ne kaha he ki netaji kii maut kii khabar jis tareeke se di gai, us vajah se andeh paidaa hua
 Due to unknown reasons, the news of his death was kept a secret by Japan and he was not informed about it
 cameti ke saamne jo gavaah pesh kiye gaye, ve sabhi alag-alag deshon ke the or ek-duusare se jude nahin the
 It is unthinkable to assume that the person they do not know very well will hide something about them
 pehle bhi kiya gaya he daawa- plane krash main hi hui thi moutis file kare mutabik netaji kii maut plane krash main hi hui thi
 The same claim has also been made on a British website and the evidence given to a Taiwan official, Tan Ti-ti, has been released as an argument
 bollywood ke tiger salmaan khan ke lakhon phens kii nigahen aaj jodhpur ke seshan court par hongi, jahaan thodi der main salmaan kii jamaanat yachika par sunwaayee honi he
 However, Salman should not have much difficulty in getting bail and there is every possibility that he will be released on bail today
 salmaan ko bel milane ke pukhta aadhaar bhi hai
 For Salman's fans, we are telling about those reasons, due to which the chances of getting him are increased
 1
 The most important reason is that during the last 20 years, when the court summoned Salman for hearing, he himself reached the court
 2
 Secondly, Salman has also extended full cooperation to the investigating agencies in the investigation of the case so far
 3
 The third important aspect about Salman is that unlike the Mumbai Hit and Run case, he did not make any kind of rhetorical rhetoric in the media nor questioned any judgment of the court nor mocked it 4
 cese main salmaan ke saath aaropee rahe anya bollywood kalakaaron saf ali khan, tabboo, neelam or sonaali bendre ko bari kar diya janaa bhi salmaan ke paksh main ja saktaa he
 5
 isi cese se jude arms act ke tahat lage aarope main salmaan pehle hi bari ho chuke hai
 6
 salmaan ko hoicourt ne sabhi aaropon se bari kar diya tha
 7
 guuruuvaar ko CJM court ne salmaan ko sajaa to suna di, lekin maamle main koi nayaa gavaah yaa saboot adaalat ke saamne nahin aae
 Let me tell you that Salman Khan's lawyer Anand Desai also called the CJM court's decision yesterday as a surprise
 salmaan ke vakil kaa to yahaan tak kahana he ki sijeem court ke faisle se aisa prathit ho rahaa he ki vaardaat vaale samay salmaan khan akele hi aadhi raat main jodhpur ke us remote ilaake main shikaar karne nikle the
 Please tell that Salman Khan has been convicted by Jodhpur CJM court in 20 year old black deer hunting case and sentenced to 5 years
 seshan court se nahin mili bel to yah hoga aglaa kadamasalmaan khan ko agar seshan court se bel nahin milti he to unke vakil hai court yaa supreme court bhi ja sakate hai
 However, in such a situation, Salman will have to wait a few more days to come out of jail
 sijeem court ne apane faisle ke khilaaf apil daayar karne ke liye60 din kii miyadatay kii he
 According to the law, if Salman had been sentenced to less than 3 years, the bail petition would have been filed in the CJM court itself
 lekin saat saal tak kii sajaa ke maamle main bel ke liye jila jaj kii adaalat main apil kerani hoti he
 As the weather changes, diseases caused by dengue, malaria and chikungunya mosquito start hunting people

 bataa den ki is saal dengue ke kareeb 22 or malaria ke 44 maamle ab tak saamne aa chuke hai
 Last year, 2798 dengue cases were reported in the Municipal Corporation of Delhi, out of which four victims died during treatment

 haalanki is baar machhar se hone vaali in bimariyon par niyantran paane ke liye abhi se dilli sarkaar or nagarnigam ne apni taraf se taiyaariyaan shuru kar di hai
 It has also been decided to celebrate Breeding Day to make people aware of malaria and dengue in a meeting of Delhi Municipal Corporation and Health Department with the Union Ministry of Health
