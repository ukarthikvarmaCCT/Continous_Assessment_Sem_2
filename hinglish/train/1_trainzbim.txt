 karnataka ke mukhyamantri bi es yediurppa ne shanivaar ko kaha ki vah apana kaarykaal puraa karenge
 The Chief Minister said that it is his responsibility to bring BJP back to power and he will continue to work for the strength of BJP "till his last breath"
 unhone apane maujuuda kaarykaal ko zyada chunauteepurn maanate hue khud ko "kamjor mukhyamantri" bataane or sarkaar ke ab tak ke pradarshan ko 'shunya' ank dene ke liye vipaksh ke netaa siddharamaiya par bhi nishaanaa saadhaa
 He said, "I will work for the strength of the party till my last breath
 mujhe koi pad nahin chaiye
 People know who i am
 " mukhyamantri ne 'pitiai-bhashaa' ko diye saakshaatkaar main kaha, "main party ko or majboot karne ke liye kaam karuunga or ise phir se satta main laana meri jimmedaari he
 "the bjp-led government of the state completed its 100 days on Saturday

 He said that he has full confidence in the high command, top leaders, mlas and activists
 siddharamaiya ne shuukravaar ko yediurppa nit sarkaar ko 'shunya' ank dete hue unhen kamjor mukhyamantri qaraar diya tha
 Hitting out at Siddaramaiah, Yeddyurappa said that the conduct of the former chief minister and the way he is crossing the boundaries completely reflects his arrogance
 unhone kaha ki vah (siddharamaiya) kah rahe hai ki wo meri sarkaar ko shunya ank denge
 Who are those scorers? janata mujhe ank degi
 
 
 As the leader of opposition, he is trying to create confusion among the public due to political reasons
 unhone kaha, "siddharmaiya pehle mukhyamantri the or ab netaa pratipaksh hai
 How many seats did Congress get in Lok Sabha elections? Only one
 " unhone kaha ki log aapako (siddharmaiya) pehle hi ank de chuke hai
 In a surprise decision, the BJP has announced to release its election manifesto on April 7, when the voting process for the Lok Sabha elections has started in the morning
 party kii pravaktaa nirmala sitaraman ne yah jaankaree dene ke saath in atakalon ko galat bataaya ki party ke kuch varisht netaaon main ghoshnaa patr main shaamil kiye jane ke kuch muddon ko lekar matbhed ke kaaran ise jari karne main vilamb hua he
 This time the BJP not only delayed issuing its manifesto, but it would issue it even though voting would have started that morning
 ghoshnaa patr se pehle bijepi shuukravaar dopaher congress nit upie shashan ke khilaaf 'aarope patr' jari karegi
 It will reveal the corruption, scams and alleged mismanagement of the economy during the 10 years of UPA rule
 aam taur par raajnneetik dal chunaav se ek saptaah pehle tak apane ghoshnaa patr jari kar dete hai
 The Congress has issued its manifesto on 26 March
 loksabhaa chunaavon ke liye matdaan kaa pehla charan 7 april se shuru hoga or antim tathaa nauvaan charan agle maheene 12 may ko hoga
 Polling has already started at 7 am on April 7 for 5 seats in Assam and one in Tripura
 sitaraman ne un khabaron ko 'bakawaas' bataaya
 In which it is said that there are differences between the declaration committee head Murali Manohar Joshi and Narendra Modi for including some issues in the manifesto and not including some
 unhone daawa kiya ki chunaav prachaar main lage party ke varisht netaaon ke ek tithi main, ek saath or ek jagah mil paane kaa samanvay nahin hone ke kaaran yah vilamb hua he
 Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) general secretary Bhaiyyaji Joshi on Thursday congratulated Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah on passing the Citizenship Amendment Bill, calling it a 'bold step'
 joshi ne kaha ki aresas kaa hameshaa se yah paksh rahaa he ki jo hindu duusare deshon se pratadna ke baad bharat aate hai, unhen ghuspaithiya nahin balki sharnaarthi ke rup main dekha janaa chahie
 The bill provides for citizenship of non-muslim refugees from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh and has passed the Rajya Sabha on Wednesday
 loksabhaa se yah vidheyak somvaar ko paarit ho gaya tha
 Joshi told reporters that the passage of this bill was a 'bold step' and thanked the bjp-led Central Government, the Prime Minister and the Home Minister
 unhone kaha, ‚Äò‚Äòaresas kaa hameshaa yah paksh rahaa he ki jo hindu duusare deshon main utpeedan kii vajah se bharat aate hai , unhen ghuspaithiya nahin balki sharnaarthi mana janaa chahie or yah jaruri he ki in sharnaarthiyon ko sammanjanak jivan or samaan adhikaar mili
 But a long time passed and the refugees had to wait long
 '' joshi ne kaha ki maujuuda sarkaar ne ‚Äòbehtareen kadam' uthaaya he
 i got this knowledge in one school, although it was not my school
 baat july kii he jab mujhe dilli ke pratishthit samskruti skool main chaatro ko puraskaar dene ke liye bulaayaa gaya tha
 There were posters with views of great people, one of which also had an unusually one-eyed Israeli General Moshe Dayan's quote, "if you want peace, talk to enemies, not friends
" ‚Äùbaad main maine google par khoja to paaya ki uddhran bilkul sahi tha
 While exploring the years of war and peace in West Asia, i went through many more interesting quotes
 aman par aisa hi ek anpekshit uddhran israel kii pradhanmantri golda mir kaa mila, ''jo netaa apane desh ko jang main jhonkne se pehle hichakataa nahin, vah netaa banane ke laayak nahin he
 "you will say that in the history of West Asia, what do we need to wander while our focus should be on Japan, China, America, even a little bit of Nepal, Australia and its uranium which have all come into its own and mostly The media including commentators (especially news channels) gasp and gasp, calling it a victory for our new government and its Prime Minister's foreign policy? When Narendra Modi is trying to influence America, what is the need for such rudeness on the same occasion? This is because foreign policy does not just mean shining summits and foreign tours
 isliye bhi kyonki bharat kii ucchstareey kootneeti kaa kul jod ab bhi ranneetik hi he
 Modi understands this and we should have no hesitation in accepting this
 isiilie modi kaa pehla bada daura japan kaa lagata he or thik usee vakt jab china ke shi jinping bhartiya satta kii nai rajdhani ahmedabad main utar rahe the, pranab mukherjee vietnam main paae jate hai
 Meaning that when we were unfurling the flag in the capitals of two countries, there was a lot of doubt in our mind towards Beijing itself
 china ne sandesh padhgaye main koi chook nahin kii
 We were not prepared for the response he gave
 usne aisa sanyog baithaaya ki shi ke aagaman ke saath hi piele ke kareeb hajaar sashastr sainik ladakh ke chumaar kshetra main ghus aae
 Understanding the nature of this action and its timing was as easy as visiting Japan and Vietnam
 shi ke daure ko chaupat karne ke liye piele bas apana damakham dikhaa rahi thi, is kism kii managasaint baaten sirf china-bhakton or atirashtravaadi hulladon ke us giroh ko hi kaayal kar sakati hai jo pakistan-virodh ke rog se grast hai or jinhen lagata he ki vahaan kii har fouj utani hi majboot he jabaki har netaa asif ali jaradaari he
 Such fantasies fit easily in India's frenzied conservative environment and try to lighten even the country's most serious diplomatic insult after so long
 or yah sab tab ho rahaa he jab hamane aakhirkaar ek shashakt netaa ko chun liya he
 China used its tour to air our balloons
 jise ham apni jameen samajhate hai us par ve aaraam se tahaltey rahe jabaki hamaare nae pradhanmantri apane grih nagar main utsav manaate hue unke raashtrapati ko dekh-dekh muskaraate rahe
 Would we have shown this patience even if Pakistan had been in place of China? Then we would have been so ardent that their diplomats canceled talks only on drinking tea with Hurriyat leaders
 yani chota padosi maamuli dhristataa bhi kare to use latiyaa do lekin bada vaala agar tamaacha maar de to doosraa gaal aage kar do
 This is our diplomatic approach
 modi kaaphi chatur netaa hai
 They do not act foolish, nor are they in confusion
 unhen pataa hona chahie ki 1962 main china ko hamaare upar yah dikhaane ke liye hamalaa karnaa padaa tha ki zyada taqatvar koun he
 Today, Xi proved this in just three days of the tour
 iskaa matlab ki paanch dinon tak america main modi ko yah baat salti rahegi
 i would like to repeat here the four pillars of India's highest national (strategic) interest
 pehla, bharat ke bhu-kshetra main ab or koi kami nahin aani chahie
 Second, its importance in South Asia should not be challenged but it should be increased
 teesraa, bharat kaa vaishvik kad baduya chahie
 And fourth, it should have complete control and autonomy over its nuclear weapons and missiles
 china ne pehle teen stambhon ko hilaa diya he or hamen yah sandesh de diya he ki chauthe ko lekar use zyada fark nahin padataa
 i am indeed having a more serious doubt that he has also challenged the new ultra-national uprising that has come to India and reminds us that we have not yet become sufficiently right-wing
 yah bharat ko baadhya karata he ki vah bilkul alag ranneetik pariprekshya main apana aks dekhe
 Modi is currently in the US and is aware that while his rise has created new confidence, our strengths and weaknesses remain exactly the same as those of his predecessor
 chunaav se sarkaar badalati he or raashtra kaa mood badalata he, lekin usase bhu-rajnatik sachaaiyaan nahin badal jaatin
 It demands hard work, patience and a cool head
 china kii harkaton main ek pravriti maujuud he ki vah bharat ke sankalp kii pariksha letaa he
 If i were to say that the previous government had dealt with such provocations quite efficiently and with resolve, then i am well aware that people will flare up
 china ne tawang main dalai lamas kii yatra ko rokane ke liye jab bharat ko takreeban chetavanee de daali thi (november 2009), to bharat ne aankh main aankh daalkar uskaa jawaab diya tha
 When Li Keqiang visited India in May 2013 when the border was encroached, the government said that the PLA should vacate the area if the yatra is to continue
 jaahir he, is baar chiniyon ne koi mauka nahin choda
 The game started as soon as Xi arrived in India and sending back a head of state would have been almost like a declaration of war
 manmohan singh ne sampadakon ke saath ek durlabh samvaad main kisi kaddavar rajnatik netaa kii tarah bharat ke ranneetik sankat ko samajhaayaa tha
 The dialogue was not meant to be published but an editor made it the next day's headline
 isiilie ab is baat kaa zikr karke main koi vishwaas bhang nahin kar rahaa
 He had said that China adopts a very cheap "triangular" policy in order to keep India under its control
 sankshep main iskaa arth yah hua ki hamaara santulan bigaadpee ke liye pakistan kaa istemaal or is tarah hamaare prabhutv ko kam karke china ke prabhutv ko badhaayaa janaa
 As long as Pakistan keeps us trapped, China sees no need to settle the border dispute with us
 raakhi se lekar terbine tak china apane saste utpaadon ke liye bharat ko sirf ek bazaar ke taur par ahmiyat detaa he
 Previous figures show that China's FDI into India was lower than Poland
 is tarah china hamaare saath apane rishte ko vishuddh ekatarfa tizaarat se tay karata he jabaki hamaari ranneetik had ko tay karne ke liye pakistan kaa istemaal karata he
 In this way he remains relaxed
 is chakravyuuh se baahar nikalne ke liye bharat ko nai jugat lagaani hogi
 In the post-may 2014 environment, this may sound like a radical idea, but it is not
 is trikon se baahar nikalne kaa iklauta rasta yah he ki pehle pakistan kii ore kadam aage badaye jaaen or dil bada karke baaki padosiyon se bhi apane lambit pade maamle sulata liye jaaen jisamen bangladesh ke saath bhoomi vivaad kaa masalaa bhi shaamil he
 We know that Pakistanis do not cooperate and their power structure is complicated here
 lekin china ke mukaable bharat or baaki duniya ke paas vahaan se laabh uthaane ke zyada maukey maujuud hai
 The first priority on Modi's mind during his visit to America should be to establish a global alliance for peace so that the character of Pakistani politics and society can be changed
 vaishvik aadarshon main yah sarvaadhik saajha adarsh he or bharat ko america ke ird-gird ek gathjod kii jarurat hogi, or koun jane lambii daud main china ke saath bhi aisa hi karne kii jarurat aan pade
 This is exactly the strategy on which the pairs of vajpayee-brijesh Mishra and manmohan-shankar Menon have worked in the past and in both cases there has been some success with Pakistan
 taatkaalik jarurat yah he ki bharat ko pakistan ke saath samvaad behaal karne ke liye chupchaap kootnithik kadam uthaane chahie or is masale par apane sabase ahm padosi ke prati janadharna ko bhi usee disha main anukulit karnaa chahie
 Today the reverse is happening when we use the phrase of the most important neighbor for China, and we find ourselves in trouble, but after the Xi and Chumar episode, we know that China does not matter, nor does it make any difference to our nuclear weapons
 Is worried about ve purab ke pahaado main yudhak kor ko bina artilari ke tainaat kiye jane par hamaare upar hansate jarur hai
 Now we can put the quotes of both major Israelites mentioned in the beginning in the right perspective
 aapako aman chahie to apane dushmano se baat kerani hogi, jinamein sabase mushkil dushman se sabase pehle baat kerani hogi
 The new government and its voters are admirers of Israel's merit
 agar israel ke sabase kaamyaab faujee netaa aapse kah rahe hai ki jaao, dushman se baat karo, jang ke nateezon ke prati sachet raho, to aap samaj sakate hai ki aapako punarvichaar karnaa hoga
 Another note from my Vajpayee diary, i do not believe that i have met any leader with such a cold mind as Atal Bihari Vajpayee at the time of crisis
 kargil main sangharsh jab apane charam par tha, tab ek shanivaar kii shaam maine unase vakt maanga tha
 i was given three o'clock in the afternoon and i reached on time
 mujhe bheetar ke kamare main le jaaya gaya
 It was half past three, then four o'clock, i was sitting
 maine sochaa kya ve bhul gaye ki main pratiksha kar rahaa hum?phir unka ek sahyogi aayaa
 Some hesitantly said, "the Prime Minister has not woken up from the midday sleep, slept some longer today
" ‚Äùkareeb saadhe chaar baje mujhe bheetar le jaaya gaya
 Vajpayee jokingly said with a few blush, "hey, hey, hey, it's gone, we were asleep and Shekharji had to wait, now what will happen?" i was already irritated so asked, " "but Atalji, the war in Kargil and you have been sleeping for two hours in the afternoon?" "yes, right you said", Atalji said and his eyes were "horrified"
 ve bole, ''jang chal rahi he, rifl lao, atalji ladgaye jaaenge ab kargil main, desh main javaanon kii kami jo ho gai he
 "after that we both laughed, then they got together on a pastry and i got a lesson in how a strong and confident leader maintains his restraint even in the grave
 bharat baar baar saboot detaa rahaa he, ki anderworld don daud ibrahim or jaish kaa sargana moulana masood ajahar pakistan main hi hai, lekin pakistan ne ek baar phir isse inkaar kar diya he

 ' cartoonist aseem trivedi ke kilaaf itani sakht karrwai par sawaal uth rahe hai
 People and social workers of different parties have stood in favor of Aseem Trivedi
 unka kahana he loktantr main bolne kii azaadi par is tarah kaa paharaa nahin ho saktaa
 The government says freedom of speech is fine but the dignity of national symbols should be taken care of
 soochna prasaaran mantri ambika soni ne somvaar ko kaha cartoonist artist hote hai
 They should take care of constitutional Laxman Rekha
 unhen bharat ganraajya ke pratikon ko apane cartoonon kaa aadhaar yaa vishay nahin bananaa chahie
 On the other hand, cartoonists believe that such action is dangerous for democracy without a law which has been in existence since the British era
 hindustan ke cartoonist rajendra dhodapakar ne enditivi se kaha aseem par deshadroh kaa aarope lagaana mukhartapurna he yah loktantric tarika nahin he
 Matters of expression should not be dealt with in a police manner

 After the arrest of Aseem Trivedi, a new debate has erupted in the country regarding the extent of freedom of expression
 is vivaad ke saamne aane ke baad mukhya taur par do tarah ke sawaal uth rahe hai
 
 
 The first is whether the freedom to speak should be unlimited and the second is whether the existing laws to deal with such cases are outdated
 kya kisi sahakaarita bank main paanch din ke bheetar 750 karod rupee jamaa ho sakate hai, inaki badali ho sakati he
 It is true that i do not have an authentic answer to this, yet you can make an effort which you can also say
 kya aisa ho saktaa he ki pehle ham pataa karen ki bainkon main rakhi note ginaney kii mashin ek ghante main yaa 12 ghante main kitne note gin detii he
 In banks, cashiers usually have only one note counting machine
 aam taur par kisi shakha main ek hi kaisier hota he
 So how many notes can he count with that machine? iskaa koi sahi paimaana nahin mil paaya ki koi mashin ek ghante main kitne note ginati he
 Talking to some cashiers, they said that it takes one to two minutes to count the pack of a note
 puraane noton kii gaddi hoti he to use phir se sajaana padataa he, yani sabhi noton ko ek disha main rakhana padataa he or idhar-udhar se dekhnaa padataa he, isamen ek do minute lag jate hai
 a pack contains 100 notes
 nai gaddi to jaldi gin lee jaati he magar puraane noton kii gaddi main thodaa vakt lag jaataa he
 There are one lakh in a cart of thousand rupees
 kaitiyaron ne alag-alag rakam bataai
 One said that in a branch there is a cashier, there you cannot count more than 10 crores in a day
 is hisaab se 5 din main 750 karod rupee ko ginana bahut mushkil he
 Another cashier said that packets of new notes should be prepared for counting from the machine but 750 crore is not possible in three to five days
 main apni speed bahut acchhee maanata hum phir bhi ye mere liye sambhav nahin he
 The cashier said that on 10, 11, 12, 13 November 2016, four of his fellow cashiers had counted the notes on high efficiency machines, when four people could count only 26 crores in four days
 chaaron ne subah 8 baje se raat ke 10 baje tak ginati kii thi
 In this context, it is not possible to accumulate so many notes in one branch
 kaitiyaron kii maane to ho hi nahin sakate
 The cashier also said that it is not just counting
 500, 1000 ke hisaab se khate main feed karnaa hota he
 Real - fake identification has to be done
 unka alag-alag packet yaa bandal bananaa hota he to time lag jaataa he
 Now we do not know whether in five days during demonetisation, 750 crores was deposited in one branch of Ahmedabad district cooperative bank or in different branches
 isaki teen zilon main 190 branch hai
 It may happen if it has accumulated in different branches
 phir jab ye pataa chalaa ki 190 branch hai to hamane kuch kaitiyaron se baat kii ki kya 190 branch main 750 karod paanch yaa chah din main jamaa ho saktaa he, to unhone jo hisaab bheja he wo main aapako bataanaa chahta hum
 750 crores means 40,000 packets of Rs 1000 and 80,000 packets of Rs 500
 is tarah 500 or 1000 ke kareeb sava lakh packet hote hai
 To count 125 lakh packets, on an average, 500 to 800 cashiers and similar machines are required
 sahakaari bainkon ke paas itani suvidha hi nahin hoti he
 According to 190 branches the average is 4 crores per branch, which is not possible to be deposited in the cooperative bank
 kya ahmedabad zila sahakaarita bank ke paas 500 se 800 kaisier hai? note ginaney kii itani mashine us vakt thim? is bank kaa vistaar teen zilon main hai kya teen zilon main 500 kaisier honge? kuch ajeeb nahin lag rahaa he aapako lekin daawey ke saath kuch bhi nahin kah sakate kyonki ye sab to jaanch ke baad hi pataa chal saktaa he
 By the way, after talking to many cashiers, it was found out that if a note counting machine works continuously, then after three to four hours, it speaks
 yani garam ho jaati he uske baad wo kam ginaney lagati he
 Work has to be stopped and those who maintain the machine have to be called
 yahi nahin jab kaisier kisi se paise letaa he to ek upabhokta se baat bhi karata he, use bataata he
 So all the work cannot be done in one to two minutes
 note ginaney kii mashin ke bare main isliye bataa rahaa hum kyonki 21 june ko bijness standard, iconomik times, manilife dot in, new indian express ne apni website par ek khabar chhaapi

 jo ki gujarat ke 18 koaparative bainkon ke ausat se kam he
 During demonetisation, one lakh 60 thousand consumers deposited 746 crores in the bank, which is only 15 percent of the total deposits
 naabard ne yah bhi kaha ki ahmedabad zila sahakaarita bank main desh kii sheersh koparative sanstha he jise haal hi main shreshth pradarshan kaa puraskaar mila he
 So what happened today is in front of you
 ab ham nahin jaanate hai ki notebandi ke dauraan paanch dinon main 750 karod ahmedabad zila sahakaarita bank ke ek branch main jamaa hua yaa phir alag-alag branchon main
 It has 190 branches in three districts
 agar alag-alag branchon main jamaa hua hoga to ho saktaa he
 Then when it came to know that there are 190 branches, we talked to some cashiers that if 750 crore can be deposited in 190 branches in five or six days, then i want to tell you the account they have sent
 750 karod kaa matlab he 1000 rupee ke 40,000 packet or 500 rupee ke 80,000 packet
 In this way, there are about 125 lakh packets of 500 and 1000
 sava lakh packet ginaney ke liye ausatan 500 se 800 kaisier or itani hi mashine chahie
 Co-operative banks do not have this much facility
 190 branch ke hisaab se ausat 4 karod prati branch hota he jo sahakaari bank main jamaa mumkin nahin he
 Does Ahmedabad District Cooperative Bank have 500 to 800 cashiers? How many note counting machines were there at that time? This bank is expanded in three districts
 Will there be 500 cashiers in three districts? You are not feeling anything strange but you cannot say anything with the claim because all this can be revealed only after investigation
 vaise kai kaitiyaron se baat karne par pataa laga ki ek note ginaney kii mashin lagaataar bhi kaam kare to teen se chaar ghante ke baad ten bol detii he
 That means it gets hot after that it starts counting less
 kaam rokna hota he or mashin ke mentanence waalon ko bulaanaa padataa he
 Not only this, when the cashier takes money from someone, he also talks to a consumer, tells him
 isliye sara kaam ek se do minute main nahin ho saktaa he
 i am talking about the note counting machine because on 21 June, Business Standard, Economic Times, Moneylife
com, New Indian Express published a news on its website
 mumbai ke artiai kaaryakarta manoranjan roy ne artiai se jaankaree hasil kii he ki ahmedabad zila sahakaarita bank main notebandi ke dauraan 8 se 14 november ke bich 745 karod rupee jamaa hua
 The highest amount of money was deposited in this bank across the country
 ahmedabad zila sahakaarita bank kii website par likhaa he ki bijepi adhyaksh amit shah hi iske adhyaksh hai
 He has been the President since 2000
 isi ke saath rajkot ke zila sahakaarita bank main bhi 693 karod rupee jamaa hue hai
 It is headed by Vitthalbhai Radadia, a cabinet minister in the Gujarat government
 artiai kaaryakarta ke hawaale se chhapi khabaron main kaha gaya he ki manoranjan raay ko yah jaankaree naabard kii taraf se di gai he
 The RTI notice does not say what is unusual about it, why they doubt that so much money has been accumulated, but the president of this bank is Amit Shah, so this information was seen differently that in five days 745 crores here Accumulated means changed
 lekin is khabar kaa raajnneetik aayam apane aap bada ho gaya
 Our colleagues and other journalists also attempted to contact RTI activist Manoranjan Rai throughout the day
 unhone mulaakaat nahin kii or na baat kii jabaki ve dilli main hi the
 Why they got quiet and why they didn't talk, they can tell better
 baad main unhone phone band kar diya lekin kaha ki ye maamla aisa nahin he jaisaa media dikhaa rahaa he
 Here Scroll
in has written that many websites that had published this news earlier removed it
 in news website ne yah khabar kyon hataai iskaa vivaran scrol kii report main nahin he
 This news was first published by the Indo Asian News Service
 janata kaa reporter or manilife ne yah story chhaapi he or nahin hataai he
 Business Standard, Wire, Quint and National Harald have also published this news
 kuch jagahon par khabar to chhapi he magar usamen amit shah kaa naam nahin he
 In the sense that he is the chairman of this bank where the oldest notes were deposited or exchanged throughout the country during demonetisation
 artiai ke hawaale se chhapi khabar main kahin nahin likhaa he ki kya gadabadi hui, magar do chizein jisase ye khabar badi hui wo ye ki puure desh main sabase adhik puraane note yahaan badale gaye or doosraa iske chairman bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah hai
 Congress President Rahul Gandhi tweeted this and tweeted that "congratulations to Amit Shah Ji, Director of Ahmedabad District Cooperative Bank
 aapke bank ko puraane note ko nae note main badalane kaa pehla puraskaar praapt hua he
 750 crores in 5 days
 notebandi ke kaaran lakhon bharatiyon kaa jivan barbaad ho gaya
 Hats off to your achievement
 '' We saw the Twitter handle of BJP National President Amit Shah but there was no response to this news, whereas BJP leaders generally do not forget to respond to any allegation or pinch of Rahul Gandhi
 bijepi ke pravaktaaon ke twitor handle par bhi rahul ke is bayaan par hamalaa nahin kiya gaya jisamen unke rashtriya adhyaksh ko nishaanaa banaaya gaya tha
 Although Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad also held a press conference today, now we can not say with any claim whether there was any question asked about it or not, but as much as we could see it was not asked in this question
 kya raajnneetik patrakaron ne khud se tay kar liya ki ye koi khabar nahin he yaa phir unke zahan main kisi kaa khyaal aa gaya
 This happens many times
 vaise ravishankar prasad ne saaf-saaf kah diya ki unki press conference kashmir par die gaye sirf congress netaa gulam nabi azaad or safuddin soz ke bayaan par he
 Still someone could have questioned it
 magar nahin kiya
 Not speaking and not asking makes matters more suspicious
 isse bahetar tha ki bolkar khandan kar dena chahie tha
 The Congress also held a press conference on this
 party pravaktaa randeep surajevaala aae or kaha ki bahut hi mahatvapurn vishay par ham upasthit hue hai
 It would have been nice if RTI activist Manoranjan Rai would have said his words, if the BJP had kept its word, then the matter would have gone ahead and the matter would have been understood, but what is the silent thing in the co-operative bank that most of the money was deposited during demonetisation
 amit shah ahmedabad koaparative bank ke adhyaksh aaj se nahin hai, 2000 ke saal se hai
 However, the Government of India has said many times that many accounts are being investigated during demonetisation, in which unnaturally crores were deposited overnight
 sarkaar ke mantri ne khub zorshor se ye baat kahi he, to phir yahi baat ahmatbaad zila koaparative bank ke bare main bhi kahi ja sakati thi ki jaanch hogi ki kin-kin khaaton main kitna or kiskaa paisa jamaa hua he
 Randeep Surjewala has alleged not only about two banks but also about Amreli's District Cooperative Bank that deposited 205 crores and its chairman is a former BJP MP
 bharuch ke koaparative bank main bhi 100 karod jamaa hue jiske chairman bijepi vidhayak hai
 BJP MP from Maharashtra's North Mumbai Gopal Shetty has said that the Congress does not have work, so it keeps raising old issues
 tippaniyan On the other hand, NABARD has said that there has been no disturbance between the two district cooperative banks
 isi kii taraf se manoranjan raay ko artiai kii soochna di gai thi
 Business Standard quoted PTI as saying
 naabard ne kaha he ki ahmedabad zila sahakaarita bank main prati khatedaar ausat jamaarashi 46, 795 rupee hai
 Which is lower than the average of 18 cooperative banks in Gujarat
 notebandi ke dauraan ek lakh 60 hazaar upabhoktaaon ne bank main 746 karod jamaa kiye jo kul jamaa raashi kaa maatr 15 pratishat he
 NABARD also said that Ahmedabad District Cooperative Bank has the country's top cooperative institution which has recently received the Best Performance Award
 to aaj jitna hua utana aapke saamne he
 750 crores means 40,000 packets of Rs 1000 and 80,000 packets of Rs 500
 is tarah 500 or 1000 ke kareeb sava lakh packet hote hai
 To count 125 lakh packets, on an average, 500 to 800 cashiers and similar machines are required
 sahakaari bainkon ke paas itani suvidha hi nahin hoti he
 According to 190 branches the average is 4 crores per branch, which is not possible to be deposited in the cooperative bank
 kya ahmedabad zila sahakaarita bank ke paas 500 se 800 kaisier hai? note ginaney kii itani mashine us vakt thim? is bank kaa vistaar teen zilon main hai kya teen zilon main 500 kaisier honge? kuch ajeeb nahin lag rahaa he aapako lekin daawey ke saath kuch bhi nahin kah sakate kyonki ye sab to jaanch ke baad hi pataa chal saktaa he
 By the way, after talking to many cashiers, it was found out that if a note counting machine works continuously, then after three to four hours, it speaks
 yani garam ho jaati he uske baad wo kam ginaney lagati he
 Work has to be stopped and those who maintain the machine have to be called
 yahi nahin jab kaisier kisi se paise letaa he to ek upabhokta se baat bhi karata he, use bataata he
 So all the work cannot be done in one to two minutes
 note ginaney kii mashin ke bare main isliye bataa rahaa hum kyonki 21 june ko bijness standard, iconomik times, manilife dot in, new indian express ne apni website par ek khabar chhaapi
 Mumbai-based RTI activist Manoranjan Roy has obtained information from RTI that Rs 745 crore was deposited during demonetisation in Ahmedabad District Cooperative Bank from November 8 to 14
 desh bhar main sabase zyada paisa isi bank main jamaa hua
 It has been written on the website of Ahmedabad District Cooperative Bank that BJP President Amit Shah is its chairman
 san 2000 se adhyaksh hai
 With this, Rs 693 crore has been deposited in the District Cooperative Bank of Rajkot
 jiske chairman gujarat sarkaar ke cabinet mantri vitthalbhai radadia hai
 Reports quoting the RTI activist said that this information has been given to Nabard by Rai Manoranjan Rai
 artiai kii soochna main yah nahin likhaa he ki isamen asamaanya baat kya he, kyon unhen shaq he ki itane paise jamaa hue, magar is bank ke adhyaksh amit shah hai, isliye is jaankaree ko alag tareeke se dekha gaya ki paanch dinon main 745 karod yahaan jamaa hue yani badale gaye
 But the political dimension of this news itself got bigger
 hamaare sahyogi or anya patrakaron ne bhi din bhar artiai kaaryakarta manoranjan raay se sampark karne kaa prayaas kiya
 He did not meet nor talk while he was in Delhi
 ve kyon chup ho gaye or kyon baat nahin kii, vahi behatar bataa sakate hai
 He later switched off the phone but said that this is not the case as the media is showing

 News has appeared in some places but Amit Shah's name is not there
 is arth main ki ve is bank ke chayaraman hai jahaan notebandi ke dauraan deshbhar main sabase adhik puraane note jamaa hue yaa badale gaye
 The RTI quoted in the news did not mention what went wrong, but two things that made this news big is that the oldest notes in the whole country were replaced here and the other is its chairman BJP National President Amit Shah
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne is par chutki lete hue twit kar diya ki "ahmedabad zila sahakaarita bank ke nideshak amit shah ji ko badhai
 Your bank has received the first prize for converting an old note into a new one
 5 dinon main 750 karod
 Demonetisation has ruined the lives of millions of Indians

 The Twitter handle of BJP spokespersons was also not attacked by Rahul's statement in which his national president was targeted
 vaise kendriya mantri ravishankar prasad ne aaj baqayda press conference bhi kii, ab ham daawey ke saath nahin kah sakate ki vahaan unase is bare main koi sawaal poocha gaya yaa nahin magar jitna ham dekh paae usamen unase ye sawaal nahin kiya gaya tha
 Have political journalists decided on their own that this is not news or that someone has lost their mind
 kai baar aisa bhi hota he
 However, Ravi Shankar Prasad made it clear that his press conference is only on the statements of Congress leaders Ghulam Nabi Azad and Saifuddin Soz on Kashmir

 Amit Shah is not the Chairman of Ahmedabad Cooperative Bank since today, he is since 2000
 vaise bharat sarkaar ne kai baar kaha he ki notebandi ke dauraan kai khaaton kii jaanch ho rahi he jinamein aswabhaavik rup se ratorat karodon jamaa ho gaye
 The Minister of the Government has said this very strongly, then the same thing could be said about the Ahmedabad District Cooperative Bank that the investigation will be done in which accounts and how much money has been deposited
 randeep surajevaala ne sirf do bainkon ke bare main nahin balki amarelli ke zila sahakaarita bank ke bare main bhi aarope lagaaya he ki vahaan 205 karod jamaa hue or iske chayaraman bijepi ke purv saansad hai
 100 crores were also deposited in the Cooperative Bank of Bharuch, which is headed by BJP MLA

 NABARD has stated that the average deposit per account holder in Ahmedabad District Cooperative Bank is Rs 46,795
 jo ki gujarat ke 18 koaparative bainkon ke ausat se kam he

 bijness standard ne pitiai ke hawaale se khabar chhaapi he
 NABARD has stated that the average deposit per account holder in Ahmedabad District Cooperative Bank is Rs 46,795
 jo ki gujarat ke 18 koaparative bainkon ke ausat se kam he
 During demonetisation, one lakh 60 thousand consumers deposited 746 crores in the bank, which is only 15 percent of the total deposits
 naabard ne yah bhi kaha ki ahmedabad zila sahakaarita bank main desh kii sheersh koparative sanstha he jise haal hi main shreshth pradarshan kaa puraskaar mila he
 So what happened today is in front of you

 '' We saw the Twitter handle of BJP National President Amit Shah, but there was no response to this news, whereas BJP leaders generally do not forget to respond to any allegation or pinch of Rahul Gandhi

 Although Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad also held a press conference today, now we can not say with any claim whether there was any question asked about it or not, but as much as we could see it was not asked in this question
 kya raajnneetik patrakaron ne khud se tay kar liya ki ye koi khabar nahin he yaa phir unke zahan main kisi kaa khyaal aa gaya

 It would have been nice if RTI activist Manoranjan Rai would have said his words, if the BJP had kept its word, then the matter would have gone ahead and the matter would have been understood, but what is the silent thing in the co-operative bank that most of the money was deposited during demonetisation
 amit shah ahmedabad koaparative bank ke adhyaksh aaj se nahin hai, 2000 ke saal se hai
 However, the Government of India has said many times that many accounts are being investigated during demonetisation, in which unnaturally crores were deposited overnight
 sarkaar ke mantri ne khub zorshor se ye baat kahi he, to phir yahi baat ahmatbaad zila koaparative bank ke bare main bhi kahi ja sakati thi ki jaanch hogi ki kin-kin khaaton main kitna or kiskaa paisa jamaa hua he
 Randeep Surjewala has alleged not only about two banks but also about Amreli's District Cooperative Bank that deposited 205 crores and its chairman is a former BJP MP
 bharuch ke koaparative bank main bhi 100 karod jamaa hue jiske chairman bijepi vidhayak hai

 a major security flaw has been found in the dating app Tinder and has been revealed by an Indian hacker
 security research anand prakaash ne fasebuk acount kit sarvice ke jariye tinder main log in hone kii khami dhundhi he
 For this, he has been given a reward of $ 5,000 from Facebook
 tinder ne bhi unhen is khami dhundne ke liye 1250 dollar kaa inaam diya he
 Anand Prakash has explained that the users who use mobile numbers as their username for the Tinder app could have been affected by this bug
 jo yujar apane phone number ke jariye tinder ap main log in karte the unke acount ko hack karnaa aasaan tha or ye fasebuk acount kit ke jariye mumkin tha
 Security researcher Anand Prakash talks to us
 unhone bataaya he ki is khami se wo tamaam tinderyugers khatre main the jo apana acount mobile number se log in karte the
 However, he said that it is difficult to tell how many people's accounts have been hacked
 anand prakaashan ke mutabik tinder web or tinder mobile ap donon ko hi yujar mobile number ke jariye log in kar sakate hai
 Login service is provided by Facebook account
 tinder par phone number se log in karte hi accountkit
 com is redirected
 othentication safal hone par acount kit tinder login ke liye token detaa he
 It is worth noting that Account Kit is a product of Facebook which allows users to register and log in some apps through phone numbers
 email ke jariye bhi log in kaa opshan miltaa he
 However, it does not require a password and can be logged into any other application through the app itself and Anand Prakash has found the drawback here
 anand prakaashan ne is bare main fasebuk or tinder ko jaankaree di jiske baad donon hi companiyon ne is bag ko thik kiya or ab aisi dikkat nahin aa rahi he
 Let us tell you that Anand Prakash has been finding bugs in tech companies like Facebook and Uber many times before and for this he has been getting rewards from Facebook and companies have also appreciated him

 kya bhartiya team ko bhavishya main sachin tendulkar kii kami khalegi
 
 
 The If the answer to this question is found with the help of statistics, then it seems that at least in Test cricket this star batsman will be lacking
 pichley 24 varshon main bharat ne sachin tendulkar ke bina keval 17 test match khele hai, or inamen se jo bhi match usne majboot tiimon ke khilaaf khele, unamem jujhna padaa

 He did not represent the Indian team in Test matches in August 2001 for the first time
 sachin tendulkar apane daaen paanv ke anguuthe main hairline fracture ke kaaran srilanka daure main teen test match nahin khel paae the
 India missed Sachin Tendulkar a lot in this series, as the team lost by a big margin of 10 wickets and innings and 77 runs respectively in the first and third Test matches in Galle and Colombo

 India then landed in Chennai in the next Test match without Sachin Tendulkar, but they managed to draw that match
 zimbabwe ke varsh 2005 ke daure main bhi sachin tendulkar nahin khel paae the

 iske baad sachin tendulkar kabhi chot kii vajah se test team se baahar nahin hue
 However, he did not tour the West Indies in June 2011 after the World Cup

 Senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor said that it is the responsibility of the party to protect secularism
 unhone saath hi kaha ki hindi pattee main party ke sankat kaa samaadhaan 'bahusankhyak tushtikaran' main yaa 'coke lite' kii tarj par kisi tarah ke 'lite hindutv' kii peshkash main nahin he or is raah par chalane se 'congress jiro' ho jaaegi
 He also alleged that the claim by the BJP and its allies to be Hindu is no different from the loyalty of 'rogue supporters of British football' to their team
 apni kitaab 'di hindu ve: en introdection tu hinduism' ke locarpan se pehle 'pitiai-bhashaa' ko die ek intervyuu main tharur ne daawa kiya ki sattarudh logon dwaara jo prachaar kiya ja rahaa he vah sahi myanon main hindutv nahin he, balki vah ek mahaan mat ko 'vikrut karnaa' he, jise unhone vishuddh raajnneetik or chunavi laabh ke liye ek sankeern raajnneetik hathiyaar main badal diya he
 Tharoor said that as a cautious optimist, he would like to say that there are a large number of Indians who are committed to opposing the recent 'conservative trends' and will constantly ensure that 'distorted views on India' succeed
 Don't tiruanantpuram ke saansad ne kaha, 'congress party ke sadsy ke rup main meraa maananaa he ki bharat main dharmanipekshata kii raksha karne main party kii ek buniyadi bhoomika he, or isaki aguwai karnaa uskaa kartavya he
 'he said,' Those who are suggesting that the solution to the party's crisis in the Hindi belt is in 'majority appeasement' like the BJP are making a big mistake
 yadi matadaata ke paas asli cheez or uski nakal ke bich kisi ek ko chunane kaa vikalp ho, to vah har baar asli ko chunegaa
 Tharoor said that instead of being intimidated by the success of the BJP, it would be better for the Congress to stand for the principles it has always believed in and inspire the country to follow them
 63 varshiya congress netaa ne kaha, 'nishthavan log ek aisi party kaa sammaan karenge jo hamaare vishwaason ke saahas ko pradarshit kare, na ki 'coke lite' or 'pepsy jiro' kii tarj par kisi tarah ke 'lite hindutv' kii peshkash kare
 'light Hindutva' will end only as 'zero Congress'
 'haal main hue loksabhaa chunaav main puri hindi pattee se congress party kaa safaya ho gaya
 Subsequently, some within and outside the party suggested that the Congress needs to respond to the bjp's story of 'minority appeasement' and take a soft stance on its secular identity
 'coke lite' or 'pepsy jiro' mul soft drink brands ke chini rahit or calories rahit sanskaran hai
 Tharoor said, 'the beauty of Hindutva is that we have no pope to make laws, no imam issues fatwa and tells what is true, there is no holy scripture alone
 hindu mat main aisi koi baat nahin he

 Farmers harvesting kharif in Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh, adjoining the capital Delhi, have once again started burning parirapali (crop pegs) to prepare for the next crop
 isse uthte dhuen se agle kuch dinon main rashtriya rajdhani dilli or aasapaas ke ilaakon main logon ke liye saans lenaa mushkil ho jayega
 Questions are being raised whether the government will continue to look like this time of last year and will hit the air after spraying a sheet of smoke over Delhi? Remember last year's Diwali of 2017, after the Supreme Court's initiative in the National Capital Region The central government had banned the use of firecrackers
 is pratibandh ke vakt daawa kiya gaya ki deepawali ke pataakhon se rashtriya rajdhani kaa vaataavaran buree tarah pradooshit ho jaataa he or iskaa khamiyaja in padosi rajyon samet rashtriya rajdhani kii karodon kii aabaadi ko uthaanaa padataa he
 Firecrackers were not destroyed in the shadow of the ban in 2017, but despite this the national capital and surrounding states could not be saved from the outbreak of pollution
 pataakhon par pratibandh isliye lagaaya gaya jisase yah pataa chal sake ki aakhir pataakhon se kitna pradooshan vaataavaran main mil rahaa he
 Surprising facts revealed in the survey that the real villain of pollution of North India is not crackers, but stubble burning in the fields of Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and Western Uttar Pradesh
 kya he paraali jalaane kaa asar?indian agricultural research institute (IARI) ke ek dashak pehle die aankadon ke mutabik desh kii rajdhani dilli kaa vaataavaran paraali jalaane se lagbhag 150 million ton carbon dioxide, 9 million ton carbon monooxide va 0
 25 million tons are filled with extremely toxic oxide of sulfur
 IARI kaa daawa he ki dilli main pradooshan ke anya strot jaise gaadiyaan, factriyaan or kooda jalaane se lagbhag 17 guna adhik pradooshan mahaj oktober-november ke dauraan uttar bharat main paraali jalaane se hota he
 The burning of starch is about 64 times more likely than carbon dioxide in circulation than other pollution sources
 kisaanon ke liye kya he paraali sankat?paraali jalaane kii parampara bharat main nai nahin he
 According to data collected in 2014 by the Agricultural Research Institute, around 620 million tonnes of stubble survived in the country after harvesting the crop during 2008-09
 isamen se lagbhag 16 fisadi paraali ko kheton main jala diya gaya jisamen lagbhag 60 fisadi paraali dhan kii thi or mahaj 22 fisadi paraali gehun kii thi
 According to agriculture department estimates, in Punjab alone, 20 million tonnes of paddy and 20 million tonnes of wheat straw are left in the fields
 gauratlab he ki kisaanon dwaara paraali jalaane kaa kaam aamtaur par kharif kii fasal ke baad kiya jaataa he kyonki rabi fasal main nikalne vaali paraali se jaanwaron ke liye bhusa or chaara taiyaar kiya jaataa he
 It becomes a means of additional income for the farmers
 vahiin kharif fasal taiyaar hone ke baad agali buaai ke liye uttar bharat main kisaanon ke paas mahaj 15 se 20 din kaa samay rahata he
 While on one hand he has to celebrate the festival at this time, he also has to prepare the field for the next sowing
 aise main krishi jaankaron kaa daawa he ki in rajyon main lagbhag 80 fisadikisaipane khet main padi paraali ko jala dete hai
 In 2015, Dr
 Naresh Trehan gave this photo! Some time ago, the nation's famous hort surgeon Dr
 Naresh Trehan told India Today that the pollution in Delhi NCR is affecting the lungs of a man
 yah sthapit karne ke liye dow trehan ne nai dilli main ek aadmi ke fefdon kii tulana himachal pradesh main rahane vaale ek anya aadmi ke fefdon se kii thi
 According to Dr
 Trehan, the pollution in Delhi is affecting the lungs of man and he is becoming the father of many serious diseases including asthma
 asamanjas main kyon modi sarkaar?niti ayog ne 2017 main kendra sarkaar ko pradooshan ke is kaaran ko rokane ke liye 600 million dollar (3,200 karod rupee) kharch karne kaa suzav diya tha
 Following this suggestion, the central government spent $ 230 million (rs 1,700 crore) a year to prepare a proposal to stop farmers from burning stubble
 kendra sarkaar ke prastaav ke tahat vah dilli se sate teen rajya punjab, haryana or uttar pradesh main kisaanon ko aisi mashine kharidne main madad karegi jisase kisaanon ko paraali jalaane se roka ja sake
 Through these machines, farmers can easily collect the stubble in the fields and make compost
 lekin pichley saal taiyaar hue is plan par sarkaar asamanjas main he or ek baar phir in rajyon main paraali jalaane kii prakriya shuru ho chuki he or sarkaar kii skim filon main band padi he
 3200 crores vs poison? According to this scheme, the central government can completely overcome the problem of stubble by spending Rs
 3,200 crores in two years
 gauratlab he ki kheton main paraali jalaana gaiyrkanoonee he or beete kai varshon se rajya sarkarein is kanoon ko prabhavi karne kii koshishon main juty hai
 Despite this, the level of pollution in the capital Delhi and surrounding areas is deteriorating year after year due to stubble crisis
 ek taraf dow naresh trehan dwaara kii gai shodh is samasya kaa gambhir asar rashtriya rajdhani kshetra main rah rahe logon par dikhaa rahi he
 At the same time, the central government is looking at confusion about spending this money to overcome this problem forever
 kendra sarkaar ke saamne padi ek anya report kaa daawa he ki paraali jalaane se punjab ke kisaanon ko prativarsh 800 se 2000 karod rupee kaa neutrishnal los or 500 se 1,500 karod rupee kaa nuksaan nitrogen, phosphorus or potash fertilizer par kharch ke jariye ho rahaa he
 It is worth noting that if we look at the population of the states in the area of influence of this problem, then Uttar Pradesh (20 crores), Rajasthan (6
 8 karod), dilli ensiaar(5 karod), punjab (2
 8 crores) and Haryana (2
 5 karod) main kul jansankhya lagbhag 37 karod he
 Half of this population is directly affected by the pollution caused by straw
 yani desh kii 15-16 karod kii jansankhya ko vishakt vaayu se bachaane ke liye sarkaar ko lagbhag 3,200 karod rupee kharch karnaa he
 This cost per person is about 200 rupees per year
 kya ye keemat itani zyada he ki sarkaar aam aadmi ko jahrile dhuen se bachaane ke liye ise nahin chukaa sakati? ye sawaal dilli-ensiaar ke aasmaan main chaa rahe jahrile badalon kii tarah gaharaa hota ja rahaa he

 tivi today se phone par baatcheet main unhone kaha, 'bharat ek secular desh he or rajyon par food habit kisi par thopi nahin ja saktin
 Where Hindus are the majority, their faith and beliefs should be respected
 ''main bhi khaataa hum bif, koun rokegaa'gauratlab he ki kendriya grih rajya mantri kiran rigiju ne gomance khaane kaa samarthan kar diya he or apane varisht bijepi netaa or kendriya rajya mantri mukhtaar abbaas nakvi ko karaara jawaab bhi diya he
 Minister of State for Minority Affairs Naqvi had said that beef eaters should move to Pakistan

 ' Muslim organization against citizenship bill told Citizenship bill: Citizenship amendment bill against constitution has passed from both houses of parliament and will get legal recognition only with approval from President
 iske baad pakistan, bengaldesh or afghanistan se bharat aae gaiyr muslim sharnaarthiyon ko desh kii naagarikta mil jaaegi
 Muslim organizations of the country are raising questions about this
 vidheyak ko samvidhan ke mul dhaanche ke khilaaf bataakar virodh ke swar tej kar die hai
 They feel that through this bill, Muslims may face problems due to NRC process in the coming time
 moulana arshad madani ne kaha ki yahvidheyak samvidhan ke anuchhed 14 or 15 kaa ulanghankarta he
 The entire draft of this bill has been prepared on the basis of religious discrimination and prejudice and states that if the oppressed minorities come to India from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh, they will not only be granted asylum but also citizenship, while Muslim citizens are separated from it
 is kept
 jisase yah saaf ho jaataa he ki is bill ke madhyam se dharmik aadhaar par desh ke nagarikon ke bich ek rekha khinchne kaa prayaas kiya gaya he
 Passing the Bill Violations of Fundamental Rights- Madani said that this argument is absolutely wrong that the Citizenship Bill has nothing to do with NRC
 yah bill isliye laayaa gaya he taaki musalamaanon ke liye enarasi prakriya ko kathin bana diya jaae
 The Citizenship Amendment Bill also violates the fundamental rights of citizens
 unhone kaha ki bill ke nihitarth ko dekha janaa baaki he, lekin jab enarasi puure desh main lagu hogi to yah un lakhon muslim ke liye shraap sabit hoga jo kisi kaaran se apni naagarikta sabit nahin kar sakenge
 Madani said that this bill is dangerous because it can create a serious threat to the religious and cultural unity that has been going on in the country for centuries
 loktantric tareeke se karenge bill kaa virodh- hussainijamaat-e-islamic ke adhyaksh syed sadtaulla husaini ne kaha ki naagarikta bill kii ham ninda karte hai
 The bill has been introduced in a communal way and partisan
 isamen muslim ko chhodkar baaki samudaay ko naagarikta dene kaa praavdhaan rakhaa gaya he, jo desh kii anekta main ekta or samvidhan kii bhul bhaavana ke khilaaf he
 Not only this, sharing on the basis of religion is not only against the constitution but also against the values of humanity
 isiilie ham is naagarikta bill kaa virodh kar rahe hai
 Niyaz Farooqui, general secretary of Jamiat ulema-e-hind said that the Citizenship Amendment Bill is against the soul of the Indian Constitution
 ise muslim yaa kisi majahab se ham jodakar nahin dekhte hai balki samvidhan ke nazariye se dekh rahe hai
 Jamiat was Ulema-e Hind against both the Hindu Mahasabha and the Muslim League and stood with the secular mood of India
 aaj samvidhan ke usee buniyaad par is bill ke jariye hamalaa kiya gaya he
 We will go about this with the people and protest democratically

 India's membership in the SCO is considered a major success
 sanghathan ke donon bade desh china or rus ne bhi bharat kaa swaagat kiya he
 Now the question is what will be the benefits to India by joining this organization or what is the meaning of getting membership of this SCO for India
 aatankwaad par chotatankwaad se bharat kii ladaai main SCO ek majboot plateform sabit hoga
 Because the main objective of this organization is to increase cooperation in the wake of security concerns in Central Asia

 Also, India's entry into the markets there will be easy

 Relations with Russia will be strengthened, so relations between Russia and India have been going well for the last 70 years

 In such a situation, India's membership with Russia, the main member of the organization, will get deeper with the membership of SCO
 bharat rus ke saath milakar aatankwaad or sipiisi jaise muddon par china or pakistan ko gher saktaa he

 The Supreme Court has refused to hear the PIL filed against Marital Rape
 supreme court ne yachikakarta se kaha ki is maamle kii sunwaayee dilli hoicourt main chal rahi he, aise main aap hoicourt kaa darwaja khatkhataayein
 The petitioner, through his petition, has sought to include Marital rape as the basis for divorce under all personal laws and the Special Marriage Act
 marital rape ko aparaadh kii shrenee main laane kii yachika par pehle hi dilli hoicourt main sunwaayee chal rahi he
 Marital rape is not a crime according to the law of marital rape
 yani agar pati apni patni kii marji ke bina usase jabaran shaareerik sambandh banaata he to use aparaadh nahin mana jaataa he
 The central government is also against bringing marital rape into the category of crime
 centre sarkaar hoicourt main kah chuki he ki aisa karne se vivaah kii sanstha asthir ho sakati he or patiyon ko sataane ke liye ye ek aasaan aujaar ho saktaa he
 Amid this case pending in the High Court, on Monday, the Supreme Court refused to hear the petition related to it and asked to go to the High Court

 The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has decided to close its investigation against BSP chief Mayawati after obtaining a legal opinion on the orders of the Supreme Court in the disproportionate assets case
 sibiai sutron ne bataaya ki sheersh adaalat ne basapa netaa ke khilaaf kathith aay se adhik sampatti ke sambandh main agency kii praathmiki pichley saal nirast kar di thi
 But a case of indecision arose after a private person filed an intervention application
 mulaayam ke khilaaf pehle hi band ho chukaa he kesagauratlab he ki sitambar maheene main samaajawaadee party ke mukhiya mulaayam singh yadav ke khilaaf bhi sibiai ne 8 saal puraane aay se adhik sampatti ke cese ko band kar diya tha
 The investigating agency could not gather evidence against Mulayam Singh in this case, due to which it was decided to close the case
 mulaayam singh par aay se adhik sampatti kaa maamla november, 2005 main tab saamne aayaa jab raibareli ke rahane vaale vakil or congress kaaryakarta vishwanath chaturvedi ne supreme court main ek janhit yachika daayar kar mulaayam, unke beton akhilesh yadav or pratik yadav or bahu dimple yadav kii sampatti kii jaanch sibiai se karaane kii maang kii thi
 In Mayawati's case, sources said that the Supreme Court had on 8 August this year rejected an application for permission to intervene, paving the way for the closure of the disproportionate assets case against Mayawati
 sutron ne bataaya ki haalia aadesh kii pramanit prati milane ke baad agency ne mudde par sheersh adaalat ke adeshon par kanoonee raay maangi thi
 He said that the law experts were of the opinion that the agency should stop investigating the case
 visheshgyon kaa maananaa tha ki yadi koi jaanch chahta he to vah uchit aadesh hasil karne ke liye uchit adaalat ja saktaa he jiskaa sibiai anupaalan karegi
 The Supreme Court on 8 August rejected the petition of Kamlesh Verma, a resident of Uttar Pradesh, who was the man to interfere in the case filed by Mayawati, to end the disproportionate assets case
 gat 1 may ko apana aadesh surakshit rakhte hue peeth ne kaha tha ki aay se adhik sampatti ke maamle main praathmiki nirast kar di gai kyonki sibiai uske adeshon ko thik tarah se samajhe bina mayawati ke khilaaf aage badi jo taj coridor maamle tak simit tha
 However, it had said that the cbi's power to take action against Mayawati in another case of disproportionate assets was not lost by the verdict

 aisa hi kuch hua bihar ke darbhanga jile main
 Where a domineering brutally beaten a middle-aged all night
 dabangagai kaa alam ye ki wo police ko phone bhi karata rahaa lekin bihar police raat bhar chaiyn kii neend soti rahi
 The result was that the person died due to beating
 uskaa kasoor bas itnaa sa tha ki usne bete ne dabango ke ghar kii ek ladki se dil laga liya tha
 The effect of the murder of the accused, who carried out this dreadful act of murder, was so great that he himself called the police station
 use bataaya ki wo ek shaks ko peet rahaa he
 When the police did not come, the accused rang up the police captain of Darbhanga
 lekin ‚Äúbihar police sadaiv aapke saath‚Äù kaa naaraa dene vaali bekhbar bihar police ne phone tak uthaanaa munasib nahin samajha or dabangon kii pitayee ke kaaran us shaks ne dam tod diya
 The case is of Adama village in Darbhanga district
 is gaanv ke dhirendra singh kaa betaa raja urf ruthik apane hi gaanv ke surendra singh kii potee or krishna pratap singh kii beti shikha ko apana dil de baitha tha
 Gradually, the love of both began to climb

 Not caring about the family's opposition, Shikha ran away from home with her lover Raja and took seven rounds as a fire witness in the temple
 phir kya tha shikha ke gharavaalon ne raja ke puure parivaar ke khilaaf shikha ke apharan kaa maamla darj kara diya
 After the kidnapping case was registered at Bahadurpur police station in Darbhanga, due to fear of police and bullying, Raja's father Dhirendra Singh and other family members left their homes and moved around
 lekin shikha ke gharavaale unki khoj main din-raat ek kiye hue the
 On Thursday night, Shikha's grandfather and father, armed with their henchmen, picked up Dhirendra Singh at a gun point and beat him mercilessly throughout the night
 jisase uskimautaho gai
 The brother of the deceased, Brajesh Kumar Singh, says that Surendra Singh and his family members picked him up from the house and beat him to death
 is dauraan kai baar police ko phone kiye gaye lekin kisi ne jawaab nahin diya or na hi police ai
 Brajesh said that if the police came on time, his brother's life could be saved
 idhar is vaardaat ke baad shikha saamne aa gai
 Shikha told the police that she was not kidnapped, but she left the house at her own will and ran away with her lover Hrithik
 usne apni marji se shaadi kii he
 Shikha told that if she did not leave the house, her family members would have killed her

 Amid discussions on the Ram temple construction issue, RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav's elder son and former minister Tej Pratap Yadav has given a big statement
 tej pratap yadav ne bihar se eent le jaakar ayodhya main ram mandir banavaane kaa daawa kiya he
 Tej Pratap arrived on Friday to inaugurate the riot competition held at Maghada in Nalanda
 jahaan bansuri bajaakar unhone kaarykram kaa shubharambh kiya
 After this, while addressing the public meeting, he said that the next time the RJD government is formed in Bihar, it will take every brick from Bihar to UP with all religions and build a Ram temple there
 is dangal pratiyogita ko dekhne ke liye vahaan badi taadaad main log pahunche the
 Among whom Tej Pratap from the forum said that the Bharatiya Janata Party works to take votes of people in the name of building a Ram temple in the country and runs behind when the Ram temple is built
 unhone kaha, 'bijipi or aresas jo ram mandir ke naam par raajnneeti karte hai, use khatm kar degen
 After which they will play a plate with a spoon in their hands
 'tej pratap ne kaha ki bihar main unki party kii sarkaar aane ke baad wo bihar se eent le jaaenge or ram mandir banaaenge
 Only then will the BJP-RSS from Bihar and the country end
 haalanki, jab media reports mentej pratap ke bayaanko you-turn ke rup main chalaaya gaya to unhone twitor par safai di
 He wrote in a tweet, 'we said at the Bihar Sharif Dangal event that BJP people talk about building Ram temple but will not give the date
 humlog mandir aisa banaayenge jahaan hindu, muslim, sikh, isai sab log jaakar puja karenge, maanavtaa kaa mandir banaayenge tab bhaajapa kaa mandir mudda khatm ho jayega
 'till now no big or small leader of RJD had given such a statement from public platform about construction of Ram temple
 lekin tej pratap ke is bayaan ne bahes ko nayaa mode de diya he
 Breaking the alliance with the Grand Alliance, Nitish Kumar is now holding the throne of Bihar by joining hands with the BJP
 nitish kaa bijepi se haath milaanaa sharad yadav ko nagavar gujara, jiske chalate unhone soobe kii sadak par utarkar baghawat kaa bigul phoonk diya he
 In such a situation, Nitish also said that Sharad is free to take his decision
 isse saaf he ki ab nitish or sharad kii siyaasi dosti par purnaviram lagane vaala he
 Sharad does not want to live his political life like George, this is the reason why he is taking the streets of Bihar and searching for political status of the state, so that he can decide the condition and direction of future politics
 siyaasi nawz tatolane sadak par utarenithish ke khilaaf bagawati bigul foonkkarsharad yadamb apni siyaasi jameen tatolane bihar kii sadakon par nikle hai
 Sharad Yadav's base has always been OBC and minority voters
 nitish kaa bijepi ke saath yun haath milaane se khaskar alpsankhyak samudaay main naaraazgi badi he
 Not only this, leaving Yadav with Lalu is also somewhere in the Yadav society
 sharad kii raajnneeti hameshaa se saamaajik nyaay ke ird-gird rahi he
 It has also played an important role in implementing the recommendations of the Board
 aise main obisi matadaataaon par unki najar he
 In the process of making a new political formula, Sharad Sharad Yadav is working on the political journey of Bihar, where he is working on measuring the attitude of his people as well as creating a new political formula
 sutron kii maane to sharad yadav ke saamne teen siyaasi formule hai- jepi model, kanshiram model or veepi singh model
 Sharad is trying to make a new model by combining these three
 darasal maujuuda daur main koi bhi raajnneetik party dalit, obisi or alpsankhyakon ke mudde par na kaam kar rahi hai or na hi unke haq main koi aawaaj uthaa rahi hai
 In such a situation, Sharad will try to fill this empty space
 sadak se lekar sansad tak goonjati sharad kii awazsharad yadav kii aawaaj sadak se lekar sansad tak goonjati he
 Sharad is one of the few leaders who, whenever he stands up to speak in Parliament, listens to them with great attention
 aarakshan se jahaan pakshdhar banate to vahiin nijikaran ke khilaaf bebaak dhang se aawaaj uthaate rahe hai
 That is why Sharad has always been adorned as a poster boy of national politics
 maujuuda saansadon main sharad un varisht netaaon main hai, jo vicharadhara ke tahat apni baat rakhte hai
 Sharad Yadav has made his place in national politics, starting from student politics called the first step of politics
 sharad yadav kaa janm 1 july 1947 ko madhya pradesh main hoshangabad jile sthit ek gaanv ke kisaan parivaar main hua
 Inspired by Lohia's ideas, the students joined politics and became the first soldiers of JP
 jepi movement main bad chadhakar hissaa liya
 Participated in several movements as a youth leader and was detained in 1969-70, 1972 and 1975 under MISA (maintenance of Internal Security Act)
 1974 main jepi ne sabase pehle jis shaks ko loksabhaa chunaav ladane kaa tikat diya, vah sharad yadav hi the
 First elected as MP from Jabalpur Lok Sabha seat of Madhya Pradesh in 1974
 yah jepi andolan kaa samay tha or vah haldhar kisaan ke rup main jepi dwaara chune gaye pehle ummidavaar the
 Since then, he has been continuously becoming a Member of Parliament and this is now his eighth term as an MP
 sharad yadav aise netaa hai, jo teen alag-alag rajyon madhya pradesh, uttar pradesh or bihar se loksabhaa chunaav jitkar sansad pahunche
 The messiah of social justice, Yadav has always been fighting the fight for social justice
 sansad se lekar sadak tak par unhone sangharsh kiya
 Sharad Yadav has been a big contributor to the implementation of Mandal Commission recommendations
 sharad tatkaaleen pradhanmantri veepi singh ke jariye mandal kii siforeeshon ko lagu karavaaya
 Not only this, Sharad Yadav has always been fighting for the rights of Dalits, obcs and minorities from road to Parliament
 aise main yah kahana ki sharad kii siyaasi jameen kamjor he, galat hoga
 With the help of Sharad, Lalu also wants to strengthen his political ground with the help of Lalu Prasad Yadav
 sharad bihar kii sadakon par bhale hi apni siyaasi takat naapane ke liye utre hai, lekin iskaa sidhaa phayda lalu kii party ko milegaa
 Therefore, when Sharad reached Bihar, a large number of rjdineta and workers reached the airport to receive him
 itnaa hi nahin nitish ke khilaaf bagawati tevar apnaane ke liye sharad se lalu ne baat bhi kii thi
 Actually both Sharad and Lalu have the same vote base in Bihar
 isliye lalu ne unke liye palake bicha rakhaa he
 Through Sharad's campaign, especially Yadav and Muslim can be united again and Lalu is eyeing the same
 darasal isi votbank ke sahare lalu kaaphi arase tak satta ke singhaasana par kabiz rahe hai
 The fight for power continues in Tamil Nadu

 buudhvaar shaam in sabhi vidhayakon ko alag-alag samoohon main baantkar lakjri bason main bharkar kai hotalon or resort main tehraaya gaya he, taaki unhen dhundha na ja sake
 But NDTV has found one of these groups

 It is being said that he had asked for a break for the bathroom, but he did not come back
 reporton ke mutabik, pichhali raat vah kathith taur par panniraselvam se mili
 Who accused Sasikala of pressuring me to resign

 pehla ye ki wo panniraselvam ko mukhyamantri bane rahane den or unhen bahumat sabit karne ke liye kahen
 The second option is to swear Sasikala as CM and ask her to prove her majority while the third option is to impose President's rule in the state

 Special Public Prosecutor Daya Krishnan opposed Akshay's plea, saying that the lawyers are doing this to get headlines, as the SDM has already been examined in detail
 unhone kaha, ‚Äòitane gavaahon ko bulaane kii jarurat nahin he
 Just to prove that the accused was not in Delhi, i believe one or two family members are enough
 adhiktar gavaahon kii prasangikta nahin hai or maamle se unka koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 However, the court reserved the verdict for tomorrow

 Ranveer Singh has lived his dream through the film
 bataur raper unhone apana ek or tallent duniya ko dikhaaya he
 But Gully Boy, focusing on rap culture, has not been able to become 'hard'
 acting jone main to ranvir kaa 'time' pehle se aayaa hua he
 But his time in rap world is definitely over
 chaliye jaanate hai kisi bani he ye film
 Kahanagali Boy is the story of Murad (ranveer Singh) living in Dharavi, Mumbai
 jo garibi se upar uthakar kuch bada karne kaa sapana dekhtaa he
 But doesn't he know? apane dard or lafjon ko wo aksar notebook main likhata he
 Safina (alia Bhatt) is Murad's girlfriend
 jo achche khandaan se taalluk rakhti he
 There is a difference of ground-sky between their states, so their romance goes on secretly
 is bich muraad ke pita shakir (vijay raaj) doosraa nikaah karte hai
 After the arrival of the second mother, Murad is saddened to see the pitiable condition of her mother
 wo pita se darataa he or unki har baat ko sir jhukaakar maanata he
 In Murad's life, Upton is after the entry of famous rapper MC Sher (siddhant Chaturvedi)
 emasi sher mashhoor raper he
 Murad also wants to be like MC Sher
 ve usase rap kii training letaa he
 Meanwhile, because of his father's illness, Murad has to take responsibility for the house
 wo pita kii jagah driveri kaa kaam karata he
 Music programmer Sky (kalki Koechlin) offers the song to Murad and MC Sher
 ye gaanaa sansani machaa detaa he
 Then the journey of Murad becoming a street boy begins
 lekin muraad ke pita rap ke khilaaf hote hai
 Then how does his life turn between a job and a rap practice
 kaise muraad apane raper banane kaa sapana puraa karata he, ye jaanane ke liye aapako film dekhni padegi
 Actingtrailer felt that only Ranveer would dominate the story of Gully Boy
 lekin aisa kahana galat hoga
 Alia Bhatt and Siddhant Chaturvedi have also got equal space in the movie
 kai seens main aalia or siddhant, ranvir par baari pade hai
 Ranveer's character is mostly scared and scared, who does not open his tongue in front of his father
 ye bhi vajah he ki ranvir kaa role aalia-siddhant se dabta najar aayaa
 Siddhant is the surprise factor of the movie
 unhone umdaa kaam kiya he
 He has captured the rapper's swag, attitude, body language and expression quite well
 siddhant-aalia jab jab screen par aate hai chaa jate hai
 Alia has played a strong role in the role of the girl, bold, aggressive and Hatheli girl

 Gully Boy's songs have already been a hit since the movie's release
 ranvir ne apane singing tallent kaa loha manvaaya he
 The songs made in his voice have become spectacular
 sabhi gaanon ke liriks damdaar hai or sidhaa dil se conect karte hai
 The rap battles filmed in many sequences have become tremendous
 movie ke dialog achche hai
 Fresh pairing of Alia Bhatt and Ranveer Singh is effective
 gali boy dekhne ke baad phens unhen dobaaraa se kisi movie main jarur dekhnaa chahenge
 Why not see the story of Gully Boy is very simple and simple
 shaayad yahi iske kamjor hone kii badi vajah bhi bani he
 The movie lacks the hit spices of entertainment and Bollywood films
 agar aap theatre antertenment ke bare main sochakar jaaenge to yakeenan hi niraash hokar lautenge
 The film is quite long
 first half bor karata he
 Zoya Akhtar ended up playing the role of Interval characters
 second half dhire-dhire speed pakadta he, lekin bich main kahani phir slo ho jaati he
 The movie proves to be a miserable failure to keep viewers hooked
 gali by kaa clymex niraashajanak he
 Story does not have power raper banane ke ranvir singh ke junun, stregal ko or badhiya tareeke se pesh kiya ja saktaa tha
 Ranveer, breaking the shackles of poverty, dreamed of doing something big above the family and his society, but his story reflected a lack of pain and passion
 box officerap mujeec par besd gali boy ko lekar jabardast baj bana hua he
 The budget of the film is said to be close to 50 crores

 The film will benefit from its release in Valentine's Week

 Due to the single release, the movie is expected to do well at the box office

 a recent update to the software related to the online filing of income tax returns is hurting taxpayers who have acquired long-term capital gains on the sale of securities
 form 16 jari karne kii tithi 15 june se 10 july tak badha di gai thi, jisaki vajah se vetanbhogi taxperes apni inakam tex filing kii prakriya haal main hi shuru kar paae hai
 It is to be noted that e-filing of income tax return is mandatory for all taxpayers other than Super Senior Citizens above 80 years
 lekin inakam tex ritern kii last date zyaadaatar logon ke liye 31 july he
 Due to this, there is increasing anxiety in taxpayers
 times of india ke mutabik, is bare main raay ban rahi he ki inakam tex filing kii date badhaani chahie
 September 30 is the last date for filing returns for professionals or businessmen who have to do tax audit
 gauratlab he ki last date tak iti ritern file na karne par 10 hajaar rupee tak kaa jumarna dena pad saktaa he
 By December, if you file the return, you will face a fine of Rs 5000 and then a fine of Rs 10,000
 haalanki jin logon kii texable inakam 5 lakh se kam he, unke liye jurmaan sirf 1 hajaar rupee kaa hoga
 What happens LTCG tax: If someone has earned more than Rs 1 lakh from listed shares and equity mutual funds within a year, then he has to pay long term capital gains tax
 pehle is tarah ke tex se shairdharakon ko chhot thi, lekin 2018-19 ke bajet main ise phir se lagu kar diya gaya
 It is quite difficult to calculate this in terms of tax, as many taxpayers have benefited on shares purchased before April 2018
 isaki gananaa ke liye iskar vibhaag ne haal main itiar-2 or itiar-3 form ke liye utility apadet kiya he jisamen iesan or sicurities ke pholio number bharne kii vyavastha he
 Businessmen and professionals use ITR-3
 itiar-2 form ko wo log file karte hai jinaki kamai kaarobaar yaa peshey se nahin he or yah salanaa 50 lakh rupee se zyada he
 ITR-1 can fill those people living in the country whose salary, a house, property, other income (interest) has a total income of Rs 50 lakh and agricultural income up to Rs 5,000
 isamen ve log shaamil nahin hai, jo nideshak hai yaa jinhone gaiyr-soochibaddh companiyon main nivesh kar rakhaa he
 It is worth noting that under the Income Tax Department, several initiatives have been taken, including making the Income Tax Return (ITR) form easier
 rajasav vibhaag ne bataaya he ki 16 july tak 1
 More than 46 crore income tax returns have been filed
 rajasav vibhaag ke aankadon ke mutabik 1

 Through the development of Gwadar Port, Pakistan has provided China with a large strategic base against India, so after developing Chabahar Port, India got trade by sea route to Afghanistan and Iran
 There will be an opportunity to increase, and from a strategic point of view, Pakistan and China will get a befitting answer because the distance from Chabahar to Gwadar is just 60 The Il
