 But it was opposed by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Narendra Modi
 ab modi jaise hi satta main aae, unhone garibon ke liye chalane vaali sabhi yojanaon ko badal diya
 Criticizing GST, Rahul Gandhi said that industries are being shut down one after another due to GST

e
 IPC provides that if a man or woman commits any obscene act in public, then the police can take action against him
 haalanki kanoon main ashleel kii koi spasht paribhaasha nahin di gai he

 The trailer of Shiv Sena founder Bal Thackeray's film Thackeray has been released
 movie main navazuddin siddiki bala sahib kaa role nibhaa rahe hai
 The trailer has come under discussion as soon as it is released
 thakare movie ko abhijit paanse ne diarect kiya he or shivasena netaa sanjay raut ne likhaa he
 It is Sanjay who produced the film
 amrutha raav bal thakare kii patni minaa tai thakare kaa role nibhaa rahi hai
 Politician Sanjay Raut said on Wednesday, 'no one can ban the film and the Central Film Certification Board (CBFC), who objected to the film, would understand the vision of the Shiv Sena founder
 film ke trailor laanch ke maukey par raaoot ne yahaan media se kaha, "hamane bal thakare ko thik vaise hi pesh kiya he jaise vah hai, jaise unhone apane logon or raajnneetik sthiti par vichaar rakhen hai
 "they said," We have not coined anything
 film ke nirdeshak abhijit panase ne film main sabakuch vaastavik tareeke se darshaya he
 No one can ban the film
 yah thakare kii kahani he
 How can anyone stop it? Balasaheb banned many people in his time
 kya aaplog ise bhul gaye? kaise sibiefasi yah nirnay kar sakati he ki bala sahib kii jindagi main kya sahi tha yaa kya galat tha? keval parivaar ke log yah jaanate hai
 i am sure that the censor board will understand Balasaheb's approach
 ve samay lenge, lekin ve samaj jaaenge
 "the controversy over Bal Thackeray's biopic before release is in the news due to the censorship of Bal Thackeray biopic
 khabar he ki sensor board ko film ke kuch seens par aapatti he
 CBFC has used scissors on three scenes, which makes the Shiv Sena very angry
 movie main maujuud ek seen babari masjid se judaa he
 There is speculation of his removal

 Jaswant Singh will hold a meeting of the Public Accounts Committee today
 bijepi se nikaale jane ke baad jaswant kii ye pehali baithak he
 There are two BJP members in this committee
 dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki bijepi ke sadsy is baithak main shaamil hote hai yaa nahin kyonki bijepi pehle hi saaf kar chuki he ki jaswant ko piesi se istipha dena chahie
 The chairman of the PAC is Jaswant Singh, who is the chairman of the PAC
 bijepi ke saamne mushkil ye he ki lok lekha samiti main uske do sadsy hai,jaswant sinha or gopinath munde
 The question arises that will the BJP now participate in the Jaswant-led committee? BJP wanted to avoid this problem
 iske liye party ne sushamaa swaraj or es es ahaluwalia ko jaswant ke ghar manaane bhi bheja tha lekin jaswant loklekha samiti chhodane ko tus se mas nahin hue
 Now only the Lok Sabha Speaker has the right to remove him
 kitaab main kii thi jinna kii tarifgauratlab he ki apni haalia prakashit kitaab main jaswant ne jinna kii tarif kii thi or desh vibhaajan ke doshiyon main sardaar patel kaa naam bhi gina diya tha
 Angry with this, BJP expelled Jaswant from the party
 beshak jaswant se bijepi ne peechha chhudaa liya he, lekin jaswant se judi uski mushkil khatm nahin hui he
 To improve the transport system in Delhi and to reduce the burden of private vehicles off the roads, the Delhi government has decided to purchase 2,000 non-ac, standard floor buses
 isaki jaankaree parivahan mantri kailash gahalot ne di
 No buses have been added to Delhi's public transport system in the last four years
 gahalot ne kaha ki 2000 bason main se 1,000 basen rajya ke dilli parivahan nigam (ditisi) or 1,000 cluster bason main shaamil hongi
 He said that the purchase of new buses will send a message that DTC is not a dying organization
 cluster basen 10 maheene main aaengi or ditisi kii basen 12 maheene main aaengi
 The minister said that the government is also planning to include mini buses
 tippaniyan Even before this, the Delhi government has taken several steps to reduce congestion and pollution from roads, aud-even is one of them

 (input ieenes se) (input from IANS) desh ke 14wein raashtrapati ke chunaav kii taiyaariyaan puri ho chuki hai
 bjp-led NDA candidate Ramnath Kovind is pitted against opposition candidate Meera Kumar in the election to be held today
 chunaav ayog ne aaj hone vaali voting ke liye kii sari taiyaariyaan puri kar lee hai
 Apart from Parliament House here, 10 am in every state assemblies
 0 baje se shaam 5
 Voting will be held by 00 pm
 sansad ke donon sadanon main jahaan saansadon kii voting kii vyavastha kii gai, vahiin rajya vidhansabhaon main vahaan ke nirvaachit sadsy vot daalenge
 The Election Commission made this special preparation according to Election Commission officials that a polling station has been built in Room No
 62 of Parliament House
 yahaan vibhinn rajyon se chunakar saansadon ke liye alag-alag mejon kii vyavastha kii gai or ye saansad tay mej par hi jaakar vot daalenge
 Officials said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Congress President Sonia Gandhi and Vice President Rahul Gandhi will vote on table number-6, as the three represent Uttar Pradesh
 unhone bataaya ki sansad bhawan main kul chah mejon par matdaan hoga
 At the same time, mlas who have opted to cast their votes in Delhi will cast their votes on table number-1
 hare or gulabi ballat paper par daalenge jaaenge votis chunaav main hare or gulabi rang ke do ballat paper istemaal kiye jaaenge, jahaan hare rang kaa ballat saansadon, jabaki gulabi ballat paper vidhayakon ke liye hoga
 Here, two candidates will be named in each ballot, Meera Kumar on the first number and Ramnath Kovind on the second number
 yahaan bataane vaali baat yah he ki yahaan ballat paper main ummidavaaron ke naam hindi varnmaala ke aadhaar par tay hota he
 Purple colored pens will be used In this election, mps and mlas will not use their pens, but will use specially designed purple pens
 nirvachan ayog ne saaf kaha he ki agar kisi ne duusare pen se vot daalaa, to use avaidh qaraar diya jayega
 Ballot Boxes to be brought to Delhi by air: Election Commission has also made special arrangements to bring ballot boxes or ballot boxes to Delhi from all states
 ye ballat box sambandhit rajya ke riterning afasar or suraksha ke bich hawaii jahaaj kii seat par rakh kar dilli laayaa jayega
 The interesting thing here is that like a passenger, a plane ticket is also taken for the ballot box
 iske baad 20 july ko dilli main sabhi voton kii ginati hogi or usee din shaam tak nattejey bhi ghoshit kar die jaaenge
 Kovind's victory sure! Let us know that the term of President Pranab Mukherjee is coming to an end on July 24, the next day i
e
 on July 25, the new President will take over
 siyaasi samikarnon ko dekhen to is chunaav main endie ummidavaar ramnath kovind kii jeet pakki maani ja rahi he
 Both the candidates Ramnath Kovind and Meira Kumar, who are involved in the presidential election race, come from the Dalit community and have worked hard to gain the support of the mlas by moving around the country
 aankadon kii baat kii jaae to bihar ke purv rajyapal kovind kii daavedaari majboot najar aa rahi he, kyonki unhen endie ke alaava jediu or biju janata dal (bijedy) jaise vipakshi dalon kaa bhi samarthan hasil he
 Total 1 of electoral college near JDU
 91 fisadi vot he, jabaki bijedy ke paas 2
 99 percent of the vote
 iske alaava telugana main sattarudh telugana raashtra samiti (tiares) ke paas 2%, ol india anna dravid munetra kadgam (AIADMK) kaa ek gut (5
 39%) and YSR Congress (1
 53%) ne bhi kovind ke paksh main matdaan karne kii ghoshnaa kii he
 With Futkovind appearing as a candidate in the opposition, differences between the opposition parties were also exposed, as the JDU went against its constituents - Congress and Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) in Bihar and announced their support for Kovind
 
 yahaan mira kumaar ko congress sahit 17 mukhya vipakshi dalon kaa samarthan hasil he, jisamen dilli kii sattadhari aam aadmi party (AAP) bhi shaamil he
 Explain that the value of the vote of every MP in the Presidential election is 708, while the votes of the mlas will be valued according to the population of their states, like the value of the vote of one MLA from Uttar Pradesh is 208, while the mlas of a less populated state like Arunachal The value of the vote is 8 seats
 aise main kovind ko nirvaachak mandal ke kul 10,98,903 maton main se 63 fisadi se zyada mat milane kii sambhaavna he
 However, no party has issued a whip for the presidential election so far
 aise main vipakshi ummidavaar loksabhaa kii purv adhyaksh mira kumaar ne matadaataaon se 'apni antaratma kii aawaaj' sunakar matdaan karne kii apil kii he
 For more than a decade, many environmentalists have consistently demanded that solutions to the problem of global warming be found
 haalat kuch itane kharaab ho chale ki tamaam antarrashtriya sammelnon main rashtradhyakshon ko is mudde par charchaa tak kerani pad rahi he or samasya ke nidaan ke thos upaay kii disha main kadam uthaane par majaboor sa hona pad rahaa he
 The present situation shows that the solution of the problem is not the priority of any nation in the recent past and this discussion is limited to the table
 aise samay main climet central naam kii sanstha or kalakaar nichole lam ne kuch tasveeron ke jariye bhavishya kii tasviren taiyaar kii hai
 These pictures are from some cities of the world and have tried to tell what will happen if the temperature increases in a similar way
 tasviren kaaphi daraane vaali hai or janamanas ko jhakzor dengi or vivash kar dengi is ore prayaas karne ke liye ki samasya kaa jald se jald samaadhaan khoja jaae
 These pictures attempt to explain the future of India's Mumbai, Britain's London and America's New York
 ye sabhi shahar pani ke kareeb based hue hai
 The artist has tried to explain what will happen to these cities as the normal temperature increases
 kya aap soch sakate hai ki mumbai kaa getwe of india kaisaa hoga, jab vah aapako aadha hi dikhegaa
 Can you think about how the New York Wall Street would be if the temperature increases like this, what the bull will look like there
 yah sab vichaar hollywood kii kisi kaalpanik film kii tarah jarur dikhte hai, lekin ab yah kaha ja saktaa he ki yah sab kalpana maatr nahin hoga, yah hakeekat ban jaaegi yadi maanav jati abhi se nahin sanbhalee
 Recently, the Heads of States of all countries have discussed this subject and there seems to be an agreement to take some permanent steps for temperature control
 khaas baat yah he ki ye netagan taapmaana main do degree celsius kii vruddhi ke hisaab se charchaa kar rahe the, jabaki vartmaan main yah anumaan he ki taapmaana main kareeb 4 degree celsius kii vruddhi ho sakati he
 The comments vartmaan sthiti to yahi bataati he ki haal philhal main samasya kaa samaadhaan kisi raashtra kii praathamikta nahin he or yah charchaa patal tak hi simit he
 At such a time, an organization named Climate Central and artist Nikolay Lam has prepared future photographs through some photographs
 yah tasviren duniya ke kuch shaharon kii hai or yah bataane kaa prayaas kiya he ki yadi isi tarah se taapmaana main vruddhi hoti gai to kya hoga
 The photographs are quite intimidating and will shock and compel the public to try to find a solution to the problem at the earliest
 in tasveeron main bharat ke mumbai, britain ke landan or america ke neuyork ke bhavishya ko samajhane kii koshish kii gai he
 All these cities are close to water
 kalakaar ne yah bataane kii koshish kii he ki jaise jaise saamaanya taapmaana badhata jayega, in shaharon kaa haal kya hoga
 Can you imagine what the Gateway of India in Mumbai would look like when you saw half of it? kya aap vichaar kar sakate hai ki taapmaana main aise hi vruddhi hoti gai to neuyork kaa walstreet kaisaa hoga, vahaan par bul kaisaa dikhegaa
 All of these ideas certainly look like a Hollywood fictional film, but now it can be said that all this will not be mere fantasy, it will become a reality if mankind is not yet alive
 haal hi tamaam deshon ke rashtradhyakshon ne isi vishay par charchaa kii he or taapmaana niyantran ke liye kuch sthaayee kadam uthaane par sahmati banati dikh rahi he
 The special thing is that these leaders were discussing the rise in temperature by two degrees Celsius, while it is currently estimated that the temperature may increase by about 4 degrees Celsius

 No one knows ab chor ke khilaaf maamla darj kiya gaya he
 Which is being searched vaardaat mahendra park thane main saamne ai he
 According to police officers, women asis have been posted for quite some time at Mahendra Park police station
 vaardaat vaale din din mahila eesai apane aaio room main baithkar apni cese filon kaa kaam puraa kar rahi thim
 At that time there was no one in the room

 In which no suspect appeared
 maamla saamne aane ke baad abhi tak file to dur chor kaa bhi police pataa lagane main naakaam sabit hui he
 Due to the theft of bags from the police station and a room there, there is a question on the working style of the police station
 saath hi thane main room tak chor aaraam se gaya or vaardaat ko anjaam dekar faraar bhi ho gaya
 This is the most surprising thing
 bag main rakhi filon se kisko phayda ho saktaa tha
 Police is investigating this
 yah pehla maamla nahin he ki thanon se purse chori hua he
 Wireless was stolen from Pahar Ganj police station
 jo kareeb teen saal baad bhi nahin mila he
 On April 20, Inspector Deepak Dubey of Ghazipur police station was stolen from the front of the government jeep police station
 jisamen ek nashediyon ko kuch hi ghante baad giraftaar kar liya tha
 However, the officer claimed that an attentive team led by Deputy Commissioner of Police (crime) Sumit Kumar foiled Gurmeet's attempt to drive him away on behalf of the commando jawans
 gudgaanv main patrakaron se baatcheet main police mahanireekshak (aijeepi) ke ke raav ne kaha ki jaise hi gurmeet ko doshi qaraar diya gaya, vaise hi usne sirsa se laayaa gaya ek ‘laal bag’ maanga
 Rao said, the Dera chief asked for the bag saying that his clothes were kept in it
 darasal, yah uski ore se apane logon ko kiya gaya ek ishaara tha ki ve uske samarthakon main use doshi tehraae jane kii khabar failaa den, taaki ve updrav paidaa kar saken
 He said that when the bag was taken out of the car, the sounds of tear gas shells were heard from about two kilometers away
 aijeepi ne daawa kiya, tabhi hamen baat samaj aa gai ki is ishaare ke peeche koi matlab he
 He said the suspicion of senior police officers deepened when Gurmeet and his adopted daughter stood in the corridor of the Panchkula court complex for a long time, while they were not to stand there
 tippaniyan Rao said, they were taking time before sitting in the car so that his people could spread that he was about to get out of the court
 unhen bataaya gaya ki aap yahaan nahin khadey ho sakate
 The crowd was about two-three kilometers away and could also come closer
 ham sector ek main koi hinsa nahin chaahate the, kyonki isse marane waalon kii sankhya bahut bad sakati thi
 He said that instead of putting Gurmeet in his car, the police decided to put Sumit Kumar in the car of Deputy Commissioner of Police (crime)
 jab ham use gaadi main bitha rahe the ki tabhi kuch commando, jo kaaphi saal se deraa pramukh ke saath tainaat the, ne gurmeet ko gher liya
 Rao said, after this, Sumit Kumar and his team clashed with him
 uske commando ko peeta bhi gaya
 We took care that there was no firing
 deraa pramukh ke commando hathiyaarband the
 The IG said that a threat to the police was found in 70-80 vehicles of Gurmeet's convoy
 ye gaadiyaan paas ke ek theatre parisar main rakhi thim
 The IGP claimed, then we understood that there is a meaning behind this gesture
 unhone kaha ki varisht police adhikariyon kaa andeh us vakt or gaharaa gaya jab gurmeet or uski god lee gai beti panchakula adaalat parisar ke galiyare main kaaphi lambey samay tak khadey rahe, jabaki unhen vahaan khadaa nahin hona tha
 The comments raav ne bataaya, ve gaadi main baithne se pehle samay le rahe the taaki uske log yah baat failaa saken ki vah adaalat se baahar nikalne vaala he
 They were told that you cannot stand here
 bheed kareeb do-teen kilometre dur thi or vah najadik bhi aa sakati thi
 We did not want any violence in Sector 1, because it could have increased the number of deaths
 unhone kaha ki police ne gurmeet ko uski gaadi main bithaane kii bajaay police upayukta (aparaadh) sumit kumaar kii gaadi main bithaane kaa faisla kiya
 While we were putting him in the car, some commandos, who had been stationed with the Dera chief for many years, surrounded Gurmeet
 raav ne kaha, iske baad, sumit kumaar or unki team kii unase jhadap hui
 His commandos were also beaten
 hamane khyaal rakhaa ki koi firing nahin ho
 The commandos of the Dera chief were armed
 aiji ne bataaya ki police ko ek khatre kii bhanak gurmeet ke kafile kii 70-80 gadiyon se lagi

 shivasena ne apane mukhpatr saamana ke jariye ek baar phir pradhanmantri narendra modi par nishaanaa saadhaa he
 In the article printed in the Saamna, the Shiv Sena has said that Christian Mitchell is being pressured to take the name of Sonia Gandhi in the agustawestland case
 isamen yah bhi kaha ki sonia gandhi yaa congress ke prati hamaare man main kisi prakaar kii koi mamata hone kaa sawaal hi nahin uthta, lekin raajnneetik shadyantr ke liye sarkari mashinariyon kaa manamaana istemaal band hona chahie
 Explain that the Enforcement Directorate gave information in a Delhi court that 'british broker' Christian Mitchell of the 3600 crore agustawestland chopper deal named Mrs Gandhi during the investigation
 is jaankaree par congress or bhartiya janata party ke bich khinchataan shuru ho gai
 Michel was used for the assembly elections, in the attack, targeting PM Modi, it is said, 'whoever this is Michelle or Fishel, when he was captured from Dubai and brought to Delhi, the election campaign of 5 states was at the peak and There was uproar in the BJP
 pradhanmantri modi ne ek-do badi jansabhaon main mishael kaa ullekh kar kaha, dekho, ab kya visphot hota he, britain se dalal aayaa he, ab main kisi ko nahin chhoduunga
 The meaning of these things is now understood
 'shivasena ne kaha, 'yah sanket pradhanmantri narendra modi ne diya ki mishael, sonia gandhi or unke bachche kaa naam lene vaala he
 Even before Mitchell's investigation began, Modi made it clear by pointing a finger at Gandhi, it seems a bit ridiculous
 mishael ko hindustan laane ke baad bhi paanch rajyon main modi pranit bhaajapa kaa jo paraabhav hona tha, wo hi hua
 Now Mission Mitchell's goal is 2019 and it seems clear
 mishael kothri main he or andar kya chal rahaa he ye koi nahin bataa saktaa
 Regarding the verdict in the Sohrabuddin encounter case, it was said in the case that the result of the Sohrabuddin encounter case came in the meantime and all the accused including Amit Shah were acquitted innocent
 shivasena ne kaha ki agasta maamle main sonia gandhi kaa naam lene ke liye mishael par dabaav daalaa ja rahaa he
 It simply means that the government machinery is under the feet of two to four people and they are being misused to trap political opponents in various cases
 agasta westland maamle main 432 karod rupee kii rishwat banti gai tathaa desh ke purv sena pramukh kii bhi is maamle main giraftaar hui
 What can be more surprising than that! The Rafale scam will not be forgotten due to Augusta, the public said that the brokerage has been found in the agustawestland case and no matter how big the accused are, they cannot be dropped and The Congress will have to answer in this case, but in the agustawestland case, Michelle took the name of Mrs Gandhi, so no one should understand that people have Rafael Vim Do not scam people will forget
 kwatrochi ke baad ab desh main shuru hoga mishael puranalekh ke mutabik, sonia gandhi or unke bete rahul gandhi ko 2019 se pehle gherne kii yah koshish he or kwatrochi ke baad ab desh main mishael puraana shuru hoga
 Michelle is inside and her devotees start cheering outside
 isamen kaha ki aisa lagata he ki ab mahangaai, berogari, notebandi, kisaanon kii aatmahatya, ram mandir jaise maamle prachaar main peeche ho jaaenge or mishael maharaj ke naam kaa hi jap hoga
 It is a prayer at the feet of our Mother India that we do not get the sympathy of Mrs
 Gandhi and her family by mistake

 The beauty of our face is not just our eyes or lips
 balki chehre or muskaan ko sundar banaate hai hamaare chamchamaate moti jaise daant

 kuch bhi khaane ke baad mouth wash se acchhee tarah kulla jarur karen
 What to eat: Cheese and curd: Due to the large amount of calcium and protein in cheese and curd, it helps in strengthening the teeth

 Apple: Although apple is a sweet fruit
 lekin main isamen maujuud fibre daanto ko phayda pahunchaata he

 When the words come out on the journey, the story that comes out is true of the rough ground ahead of the room and the idea
 jahaan jindagi kii mahak or sarokaar kii khushboo hoti he
 But while traveling, while giving wings to the words or thoughts emerging in the mind, when they carve something on paper, they do not just tell the story of the journey but become part of the journey of the writer's life
 yahaan lekhak kaa apana kathgharaa tuutata he jo usne apni samaj, apane sarokaar or apane parivesh se banaae hote hai
 Perhaps that is why it is more fun to put together three travelogues of traveler writers coming out from three different environments
 or lekhakon kii is qatari main lekhak se zyada maujuun agar yatra ho jaae to baat hi alag he
 Especially the journey of those areas of the country where the name of the reader comes to the mind in various ways
 lekhak asagar vajahat agar raste kii talash main ajarbaijan se lekar portblair or konkan se shimoga tak kii yatra kar aaen, sahityakar pankaj bisht agar apane desh kii talash main pustkaalay ke dastavejon se aage nikalakar uttarakhand ke pahaado se phisalte hue gujarat main jindagi or vaicharikta ko saath sametakar chaar dashakon ke daur main badalte saamaajik tehraav ko gati bhi kharama-kharama den to alag hi majaa he
 And young journalist Anil Yadav embarked on a journey in the northeast to show a mirror to Samay and Muflissi, where Zindagi means jaddojahad, where life means bread of June 2
 jahaan aaraam kaa matlab he muflisi, to aise main yahi kehane main aata he yah bhi koi des he maharaj!to ek saath teen vrittant
 But all three have different views
 yatra karne, use dekhne or bhogane kaa silsilaa alag-alag
 Different ways to introduce travel in the style of writing
 kathin to he lekin munaafe ke liye jab koi prakaashak yah jahamat uthaa le or teenon yatra vrittant ek saath chhap de to pathak ko bhi nae nazariye se yatraaon ko padhane kaa jokhim uthaanaa chahie
 Journalist Anil Yadav's visit is an attempt to explore the truth of the North East, where the writer has no less difficulties during his journey
 koi lekhak apni mushkilon ko akasar chupa letaa he to koi unheen mushkilon se us parivesh ko bhi ubhaarna chahta he, jahaan yah lage ki yatra vaaki pathak hi kar rahaa he
 Asghar Wajahat offers something different from taxi, bus and legs to different social environments, in which the reader feels that he too is traveling with the words of the writer
 yahaan use mahasoos hota he ki uske safar main asagar vajahat kii kalam he
 But in a journey with Anil Yadav, the reader will get tired, gasp, suffer tragedy and then give instructions to not take such journey in anger
 lekin phir yatra ko vrittant ke nazariye se nahin balki yatra karne kii majaburi ke nazariye se pathak khud ko lekhak bhi maanane kii galati karegaa
 Here Yadav's journalistic side dominates
 pathakon ko yah parakhane main vaaki majaa aayega ki ek taraf vajahat kii yatra, jo jaankaree ke saath sukun detii he, jo safar karne kii bechaini paidaa kar lekhkeey 'nar ko naman karti he
 On the other hand, Yadav makes the journey beats like a blacksmith because the yatra is not relaxed
 yah dard bhi he or traasadee bhi
 In the writing of Pankaj Bisht there is a feeling of the jungle raj of the government in the destruction of the forests of Uttarakhand
 gujarat main ve dekhte hai ki dwarka main dharm ke aasare logon ko parakhane kii shart mandir ke daravaaje par hi taang di gai
 These three writers, who embody the truth of the country through travel, have to deal with those people of the north-eastern state, where many people still see India as a separate country
 in sabake bich pathak in teen kitabon ke jariye us sawaal kaa jawaab bhi paa sakate hai, jahaan kaha jaataa he ki sahityakar-lekhak-patrkaar to nabj ko pakad letaa he
 Or now these people have no concerns in this era, or their writing has become a slave to their own self-knowledge
 yakeen jaaniye, in teen kitabon ke teen lekhakon ke jariye vaaki sahitya or lekhan ko lekar aap sochna shuru kar den ki yah kis raste kii talash main kharama-kharama shuru hua safar he
 You may also think what kind of country it is
 yaa phir ho saktaa he, in teen kitabon ko padhakar vaaki aap bhi tikat kataakar kahen, har baar yahi, ghar ko palatate hue sochaa, i kaash! kisi lambey safar par gaye hote
 At present, the performance of the Indian cricket team is not getting better than the average
 team ek samasya kaa hal talashti he to duusari samasya ke chalate haar jaati he
 The batsmen do better then the bowlers sink the team
 gendbaaz behatar karte hai to ballebaazi bikhar jaati he
 Captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni's captaincy is constantly under question
 kabhi 'captain kool' ke naam se mashhoor dhoni club str ke captain najar aa rahe hai
 It is said that when the performance continues to deteriorate, confidence starts to waver
 team india bhi is vakt dagamagaati hui naav ban chuki he
 Number seven is the crisis in the midst of all these difficulties
 amuman vanade main number saat par vah khilaadi feet hota he jo olerounder ho jarurat ke hisaab se balle or gend donon se upyogi bhoomika nibhaa sake

 Jadeja's performance is when his return to Team India came after two or three triple centuries
 unhone mahaj 10 din ke andar do−do tihare shatak jamaaye hai

 sarada chitfund ghotaalaa maamle main party or sarkaar ke bich kisi tarah ke 'virodhabhas' kii baat ko khaarij karte hue bhaajapa ne guuruuvaar ko kaha ki teen agenciyaan maamle kii jaanch kar raheen hai or sarkaar ne is sambandh main clinit nahin di he
 This statement came at a time when the government today appeared to speak in contradictory tone to a statement by BJP President Amit Shah
 carmik maamalon ke rajyamantri jitendra singh ne sansad main kaha ki jaanch main abhi tak is baat kaa khulaasa nahin hua he ki sarada chitfund kaa paisa bangladesh main aatankwaadi gatividhiyon main lagaaya gaya tha
 However, the BJP president alleged that such wires were connected at his Kolkata rally
 bhaajapa ke rashtriya sachiv siddharthanath singh ne kaha, ‘‘kuch khabaron main daawa kiya gaya he ki sarada chitfund ghotaale ko lekar sarkaar or party ke bich virodhabhas hai
 Let me make it clear that there is no such contradiction
 ’’ He said what Shah had said in Kolkata on Sunday was based on the news that was made public
 siddharthanath singh ne kaha, ‘‘lambey samay se yah baat saarvajanik taur par he ki sarada chitfund ghotaale ke paise ko pashchim bengal main aatanki gatividhiyon ke liye lagaaya gaya or sibiai isaki jaanch kar rahi he
 '' bhaajapa netaa ne kaha, ‘‘saarvajanik khabaron ke aadhaar par bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah ne kuch baaten kahi thim
 Now Minister Jitendra Singh has also said that CBI is investigating it
 ’’ Singh said, "the government has not given any clean chit in this matter
" koi hadabadi nahin he
 Let it be investigated
 sach saamne aayega
 '' trinmul congress saansadon dwaara dikhaai gai sahaara kii kathith laal diary main bhaajapa adhyaksh kaa naam hone ke aaropon ke bare main puche jane par singh ne kaha ki yah kaalpanik diary he or trinmul congress ko tathyon ke aadhaar par baat kerani chahie? He said, "trinamool is surrounded by West Bengal
 phir chaahe sarada maamla ho, jisamen uske kai saansad jail main hai
 CBI investigation is going on
 isi tarah bardwan maamle main trinmul congress ke logon ke gharon main prayogshaalaayein mili hai or kai chijen saamne aa raheen hai
 So they are making such statements
 yah sab atakalbaaji he

 They have been demanding this effect for the last 3 years
 andolan kii sadsy deepa pavaar kahati hai, 'mahilaon ke liye achche shauchalay nahin hai
 If there can be separate toilets for men then why not for women? Alam is that women cannot go outside the city to urinate
 iske liye ve kam pani piti hai, jo sehat ke liye hanikaarak he

 IANS se input Before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the difficulties of the Bharatiya Janata Party are not being named
 ek taraf sahyogi lagaataar bijepi par nishaanaa saadh rahe hai to ab sidhe pradhanmantri narendra modi par sawaal uthne shuru ho gaye hai
 The only MP from Sikkim, Premdas Rai, says that the charisma of Prime Minister Narendra Modi is getting dimmed now and if the grand alliance of opposition parties takes shape, it will be very difficult for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to return to power in 2019
 aapako bataa den ki premadas raay kii party sikkim demacretic front (esadf) centre main sattarudh rashtriya janatantric gathbandhan (NDA) kaa hissaa he
 Significantly, on one hand, where the Bharatiya Janata Party is aiming to win all the 25 Lok Sabha seats in the Northeast, such a statement from a partner from the same way can shock the BJP
 ''kshetreey taur par jeetenge, lekin rashtriya kaa pataa nahin''ek news agency se baat karte hue saansad bole ki "ham bataur ek kshetreey party aglaa chunaav jarur jeetenge, lekin rashtriya paridrishy ko dekhte hue mujhe lagata he ki modiji kaa karishma dhundhala gaya he
 The results of the way the BJP has acted with the policy of discrimination are now coming out
 "do baar ke saansad raay ne yah bhi kaha, "sansad kii kaarywahi na chalanaa hamaare jaise chote dalon ko prabhavit kar rahe hai or hamaare adhikaar bade dalon dwaara ronde ja rahe hai
 "" Congress seats may increase in 2019 elections ", commenting on the Congress' better performance in the Haliya elections, Rai said that except for Chhattisgarh, the Congress won in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan by a small margin, but the opposition parties Will be able to communicate energy to its workers in a better way and this can increase their number of seats
 unhone kaha, "mujhe lagata he ki loksabhaa chunaav main donon pakshon ke bich muqabla kadaa rahegaa or agar mahagathbandhan aakaar le letaa he to bhaajapa ke liye yah badi samasya ban saktaa he
 "" Message not corrected by the attack on CBI-RBI "" Rai claimed that there is a lot of churning within the parties including BJP and Congress ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 esadf saansad ne jor dekar kaha ki janata or buddhijivivarg sibiai or arabiai jaise sansthaanon par kathith rup main modi sarkaar dwaara kiye ja rahe hamalon ke tareekon se bilkul khush nahin he
 It can go against the BJP
 unhone spasht kiya ki ek party ke ekmaatr loksabhaa saansad hone ke naate vah hameshaa rajya ke seemaa hiton kii raksha ke liye sattarudh party ke saath hi jaaenge
 "rahul Gandhi has been successful in his endeavors" When asked about Congress President Rahul Gandhi, Rai said that after taking charge as party president, he found it difficult in many ways to give a place to the youth within the party
 Had to go through the phase
 lekin vah aisa karne main safal rahe
 He also understood that he has to support not only the youth, but also the senior people, who are very valuable to the party
 gauratlab he ki beete dinon main bijepi ke kuch sahyogiyon ne ankhen dikhaai hai

 The central government has given a hundred crore rupees for the cleanliness drive, the central government has given a package of 100 million rupees to the three municipal corporations
 is package ke saath ek shart bhi hoti he ki centre sarkaar dwaara bataae gaye kaamon main bhi hi ise karch kiya janaa chahie
 It should be used in the work of eliminating air pollution, while the Municipal Corporation of South Delhi has purchased many machinery and vehicles from this fund
 sutron kii maane to centre sarkaar ke varisht adhikariyon ne nagar nigam ke adhikariyon ko kadi fatkaar lagaate hue saafe taur par kaha he ki aage se is paise se jo bhi kaam hoga uski pehle anumati shahari vikaas mantralay se leni hogi
 Commission game is in the purchase of vehicles, in fact, the game of commissioning in the Municipal Corporation of Delhi is not hidden from anyone
 kai mauqe aise bhi aae hai jab dilli nagar nigam main selary aadi ke liye aae fund ko adhikariyon ne gaadi kareed main istemaal kar liya he
 It is said that there is a big role of commissioning in this
 dilli nagar nigam har saal karodon rupaya kii gaadiyaan karidati he haalanki nagar nigam ke godaamon main abhi bhi nai gadiyaan khadi he, jinhen istemaal tak nahin kiya gaya he

 With the decision of demonetisation on November 8, the 500 and 1000 rupee currency operating in the economy was declared illegal
 is karency kii jagah rigerv bank ne 2000 rupee kii nai karency ko sanchalit karne kaa faisla liya
 While the economy announced a fixed time to remove the old currency, the new currency had a limit on cash withdrawal from banks and atms in the country
 buudhvaar ko is saal kii aakhri maudrik samiksha karne ke baad faisla liya ki vah ab nai karency ke sanchaar ko tej karne ke liye cash vidroval par lage pratibandhon ko hataa legi
 For this, from February 20, the withdrawal limit from the savings bank account has been increased from the current Rs 24,000 per week to Rs 50,000 per week
 vahiin 13 march ko desh main chunaav prakriya khatm hone ke baad cash nikasi par lage sabhi pratibandh hat jaaenge
 It is to be noted that many experts in economic matters, including the Reserve Bank, are of the opinion that the speed with which the banned currency was ejected in the country should be increased with the same speed
 haalanki rigerv bank ne limit badhaane or cash nikasi par pratibandh ko puri tarah khatm karne ke faisle ke bich is baat kaa khulaasa nahin kiya ki usne 8 november ke baad se kul kitni nai karency kaa sanchaar arthvyavastha main kar diya he
 Therefore, even after the increased cash withdrawal limit after February 20 and the decision to completely remove all restrictions after March 13, it cannot be said that the cash shortage in the country will end completely

 According to the report of the newspaper Mint, Reliance Industries Ltd got the green signal to start operations of Jio Payments Bank this week and with this the company achieved a new achievement
 state bank of india ke saath reliance kii yah seva is maheene ke aakhir tak shuru hone vaali he
 Mint said this by quoting people associated with the schemes related to it
 enditivi dot com main chape bloomberg ke tim kalpan ke aalekh main is babat zikr karte hue kaha gaya he ki arbapati mukesh ambani ne haal hi main jeeyo sim ke jariye apane mobile graahakon kii sankhya 1 karod pahunchaa di he or jab koi free sevaayen pradaan karata he to yah aakanda hasil karnaa koi mushkil kaam nahin he
 Kalpana has written that as Andy Mukherjee of Gadfly said last month that the real battle will begin when Jio will gain revenue through its huge user base and then start earning profits
 jeeyo pement bank ke jariye ambani or acchhee kamai kar saktaa he or vah bhi aisi paristhiti main jab digital pement or mobile phones companiyon, donon, se use kadi takkar leni he
 Its competitors in the payment bank sector are from One 97 Communications Limited to Bharti Airtel
 tippaniyan According to the article, if Ambani wants his share to be heavy, he should buy Paytm a step further by launching his own payment bank
 petm wolet yugers kii baat karen to saal 2016 ke aakhir tak iske paas 17
 There were 7 crore users
 notebandi ke baad se vishaltam laabh lene vaale petm se 1 arab tranjection kiye gaye
 Now if Jio buys it, which is supported by Alibaba Group Holding Limited, then it has 7
 7 karod se lekar 17
 7 crore new users can be received
 jeeyo ko alibaba or isse judi ant finanshal se judane kaa bhi laabh hoga
 This could also give a boost to Reliance Retail Limited while Alibaba will also help in making a place in the Indian market
 ek anumaan ke mutabik, petm kaa vailuation kareeb 5 billian dollar yani 500 karod dollar ho saktaa he
 But when this richest man of India has invested $ 25 billion or $ 2500 million in the field of telecom, then this amount is equal to a drop in the sea
 kalpan ne likhaa he ki jaisaa ki Gadfly ke endi mukherjee ne pichley maah kaha tha ki asli ladaai to tab shuru hogi jab jeeyo apane vishaal yujar base ke jariye revenyu hasil karegaa or phir profit paane lagegaa
 Ambani can make more good money through Jio Payment Bank and that too in a situation when he has to take a hard fight with both digital payment and mobile phone companies
 pement bank ke kshetra main uske pratidwandi van97 communications limited se lekar bharti airtel tak hai
 The comments lekh ke mutabik, yadi ambani chaahate hai ki unke hisse kaa palada baari rahe to unhen apana khud kaa pement bank launch karne se ek kadam aage badhaate hute petm ko khaid lenaa chahie
 Talking about Paytm Wallet users, by the end of 2016, it has 17
 7 karod yugers ho chuke the
 1 billion transactions were made from Paytm, the largest beneficiary since demonetisation
 ab yadi jeeyo ise kharid leti he, joki alibaba group holding limited dwaara sahyog praapt he, to use 7
 7 crores to 17
 7 karod nae yujar praapt ho sakate hai
 Jio will also benefit from joining Alibaba and its associated financials
 isse reliance ritel limited ko bhi boost mil saktaa he jabaki alibaba ko bhi bhartiya bazaar main jagah banane main madad milegi
 According to an estimate, the valuation of Paytm could be around $ 5 billion or $ 500 million
 lekin telecom ke kshetra main bharat ke is sabase amir aadmi ne jab 25 billian dollar yani 2500 karod dollar laga die to yah rakam to samandar main boond ke baraabar he
 According to the article, if Ambani wants his share to be heavy, he should buy Paytm a step further by launching his own payment bank

 What does it not do, which is what the Valmiki society does

 His parents could easily leave this job, but he did not leave

 The Congress President said that Modi asked a person why the Dalits of the country are angry with him

 Now in the program of Modi's mind, Rahul said that for the first time, the government is not running the Parliament
 rahul ne kaha ki modi ji ne apane saansadon or vidhayakon se kaha ki tum log media ko masala dete ho
 Rahul said while attacking that now the country will only listen to the Prime Minister's mind
 rahul ne kaha ki choti se bacchee kaa rape hota he, lekin bijepi ke vidhayak ke bare main pradhanmantri ne kuch nahin kaha
 Today the IMF Chief has also spoken about women's safety
 rahul ne kaha ki modi ji ko sirf modi se matlab he
 Whatever happens in the country, but they do not speak

 How someone plays is important

 But the most important thing is that we need to win the match
 match jeetna badi cheez he, kyonki isse dabaav kam hota he or main agle match kii taiyaari kar paata hum
 i will keep playing according to the circumstances even further
 aap pehle se hi man banaakar maidan main kaise ghus sakate hai?fielding bhartiya team ke liye sabase badi chintaa lagati he

 ham is kshetra main pichad rahe hai

 main apane saathiyon ko hameshaa fielding main nai oonchaaiyaan chune ke liye prerit karata hum
 i always tell them that stopping a run or taking a catch is not enough
 aapako maidan par ati sakriy hona hoga
 When you are under pressure, you really do not know what to do next, as a result you miss a catch or miss a runout
 aisi ghatnaayen match ko aapaki pakad se dur le jaati hai
 The World Cup has been won several times due to missed catches and missed chances of run outs
 isliye is kshetra main ham kadi mehnat kar rahe hai
 Playing in front of a domestic audience is a great convenience
 kya isse aap par zyada dabaav padataa he?main bhartiya prashasankon ko jaanata hum
 i am not denying that the Indian people are passionate about cricket and one defeat can provoke people across the country
 main jaanata hum,meri team par bahut dabaav he
 But we will do well

 We have just returned from South Africa

 Our team got a great opportunity to perform before the World Cup
 kya bhartiya team ke kai khilaadi chot se nahin jujh rahe?main aisa nahin maanata
 Players will continue to suffer injuries and it is the job of the trainers how to reduce them
 kisi khilaadi ke kharaab pradarshan kaa dosha main ipiel ko nahin detaa
 Our team is fit
 vishwa cap main bhartiya pari kii shuruyaat koun karegaa?main is samay aapako iskaa jawaab nahin de saktaa
 It will depend on the day of the match, the mood and circumstances of the pitch
 yah sachin tendulkar kaa aakhri vishwa cap ho saktaa he
 i want Bhaji to play the next World Cup too
 jab ve ballebaaji karne ke liye jate hai, tab main kya sochataa hum, yah sirf main hi jaanata hum
 The whole world expects 50 or 100 runs from them — some members of the team expect the same — but i only want them to enjoy the game
 main un par kisi tarah kaa dabaav nahin daalana chahta
 During Bhajiji, we have done impossible to impossible situations in our favor
 main chahta hum ki vishwa cap main ve apana swaabhaavik khel khelen or team ke duusare khilaadi apana sau fisadi pradarshan karen
 This is the World Cup

 How did Piyush Chawla get a place in the team?

 aapke hisaab se koun-si team sabase majboot pratidwandvi hogi?sabhi match mahatvapurn hai, sabhi timen gambhir pratidwandvi hai
 What if you could not win the World Cup? i believe in positive thinking
 hamaare samarthakon ko team ke liye dua karne dijie or hamen behatar cricket khilne dijie
 The World Cup will be ours
 kya aap eden gardens main khelnaa miss karenge?beshak, ham is rajasi maidan ko or kolkata ke ek lakh se adhik cricketpremiyon ko miss karenge
 This ground is not ready yet, but i hope that it will be ready soon and other World Cup matches will be played on it

 lekin pichley maheene unhone apane bayaan se palati markar vipaksh ko tagada jhatka dete hue endie ke raashtrapati pad ke ummidavaar ramnath kovind ko samarthan dene kaa elaan kiya tha

 However, Kumar suggests with new indications that he may once again connect with his old ally BJP

 People always want to know about new facts related to Aquarius
 prayagraj kumbh par india today ke kaarykram main jaankaron ne alag-alag tark die
 Some associated Kumbh with spirituality and some linked it with spirit and explained it

 During the discussion, Santosh Shukla said that there is no description of Ardh Kumbh in the texts and it is being called as a convenience
 jabaki grantho main prati 12 varsh main mahakumbh or prativarsh hone vaala kumbh kaha jaataa he
 According to Santosh Kumar Shukla, the river Saraswati is mentioned in the Rigveda
 saraswati ke teen swaroop bhautik, aadhyaamik or daivik he
 Dr
 di pi doobe kaa kahana he ki kumbh mela ganga snaan ke liye manaaya jane vaala parv he
 The fair starts with Haridwar and the relationship with Aquarius is only in the context of Haridwar
 unka kahana he ki kumbh par raajnneeti pehle raja-maharaaja karte the or ab raajnneetik dal karte hai
 Dr
 DP Dubey has also written a book on Prayagraj Kumbh, named (prayag: The Sight of Kumbh Mela), Professor Dubey said that there are many misconceptions about Kumbh Mela
 kumbh kaa sambandh sangam se katai nahin he
 Kumbh is a zodiac and its knowledge was derived from the Greek civilization of Indians in 2 century A
D
 lihaaja kumbh mela ganga nadi se judaa he
 Descending the Himalayas, the Ganges reaches the plain from Daridwar
 vahiin kumbh ko lekar professor bharat gupt kaa kahana he ki beete teen dashakon main hui research or nasa se mili pramaanon se saaf ho chukaa he ki saraswati myth nahin, balki ek aitihaasik nadi he
 But when Saraswati became extinct, then Yamuna river is flowing through the same path
 professor ne kaha ki kumbh ke aayojan ko amrit varsha ke sandarbh main dekha jaataa he
 Kumbh is organized in places where there is nectar rain

 Now it will become the number-one party in the country
 'kaaman civil code par vivaad nahinunhone kaha ki kaaman civil code ko lekar koi vivaad nahin he

 LJP chief Ram Vilas Paswan, while accepting the lessons from past mistakes, has said that the RJD LJP coalition government will be formed in the state after the Bihar assembly elections
 lojpa supremeo ne sweekaar kiya ki 2005 main vidhansabha tathaa 2009 main loksabhaa chunaavon main bina talmail ke chunaav ladanaa ek bhul thi
 The former Railway Minister said that it was a mistake to not allow the formation of a government in 2005 under the leadership of RJD chief Lalu Prasad in Bihar
 isse rajd ko bhi nuksaan hua or lojpa ko bhi
 They have learned a lesson from this
 unhone kaha ki 2005 ke prakaran se nitish kumaar ke rup main ek aise vyakti ko satta main aane kaa mauka mil gaya jo ahankaar main chur rahete he or janata kaa bhi bhala nahin hua
 Describing this time in Bihar as interesting, Paswan said that the bubble of development of the ruling NDA will burst

 He said that after the RJD LJP alliance comes to power, he will play the role of Mahavat, not Super CM

 After forming the coalition government, he will be in the role of Mahavat so that the government does not deviate from the path
 vah nayi sarkaar par ankush rakhane kaa kaam karenge
 Rejecting the possibility of a hung assembly after the elections, the former Union Minister said that he would be able to form the government on his own without the help of other secular groups and parties, including the Congress

 punjab ke siem captain amarinder singh ne punjab ke tamaam karmchaariyon ke liye dope test anivaary kar diya he
 Now politics has also started on this matter
 karmchaaree union ke netaaon kaa kahana he ki agar punjab sarkaar karmchaariyon kaa dope test karwaanaa chaahati he to punjab ke tamaam iees or ipies afasaron or mantriyon, vidhayakon kaa bhi dope test hona chahie
 At the same time, the opposition parties have also demanded a dope test of the Chief Minister, while mixing the tone of the employee leaders
 bataa den, punjab ke siem captain amarinder singh ne naa sirf nai bhartiyon ke dauraan balki har saal hone vaale pramotion or anual report taiyaar kiye jane ke dauraan bhi karmchaariyon kaa dope test karwaane ke liye niyam banane or notification jari karne ke nirdesh die hai
 With this announcement of CM, there was a competition to get dope test done in Punjab politics
 sabase pehle aam aadmi party ke punjab state ko-president or vidhayak aman aroda mohali ke civil hospital pahunche or dope test ke liye apana sample diya
 After giving the sample, Aman Arora demanded that the senior level legislators and ministers should get their dope test first, setting an example to the people associated with the government
 aman arodane punjab ke siem captain amarinder singh kaa bhi dope test karwaane kii maang kii
 He said, "not only do all political people get dope test but also make a vow that they will not recommend in police stations to free anyone who is being caught in the supply of drugs
" aman aroda dope test karvaa kar nikle to unke peeche-peeche punjab ke cabinet mantri trupt rajinder bajva bhi pahunch gaye
 However, Sampath Rajinder Bajwa, who was taking certain medicines due to an illness, was not taken by the doctors and his dope test could not be done
 lekin trupt rajendra bajva ne bhi tamaam vidhayakon or mantriyon ke dope test kii baat doharaai or kaha ki agar jarurat padi to siem captain amarinder singh bhi dope test karwaane se peeche nahin hatenge
 At the same time, the Akali Dal also demanded a dope test of all 117 mlas of Punjab and said that there is nothing wrong in getting the dope test done
 akali dal ke pradhan sukhbir badal ne kaha ki agar punjab ke siem captain amarinder singh punjab se drugs ke khatme ko lekar agar koi or bhi kadaa kadam uthaate hai to aise main akali dal raajnneeti ko peeche chhodkar unke saath khadaa hoga
 Let me tell you, 47 people have lost their lives in Punjab in the last 33 days due to drug overdose
 isi vajah se sawaalon se ghiri punjab sarkaar ek ke baad ek kade faisle lekar drugs ke khilaaf kadaa sandesh dene kii koshish main lagi he
 First Punjab CM Capt Amarinder Singh recommended to the Central Government seeking the death penalty for drug suppliers and after that made dope test mandatory every year for all government employees of Punjab
 lekin ab bada sawaal ye he ki kya punjab sarkaar apane tamaam afasaron or vidhayakon, mantriyon, saansadon kaa bhi dope test karavaaegi yaa nahin? The Pakistan Army has launched a new maneuver on the Kartarpur Corridor
 pakistan ne kaha he ki coridor van ve hoga
 Pakistan Army spokesman Major General Asif Ghafoor has said that the corridor will be one-way
 paak army ke is faisle kaa matlab he ki pakistan ke sikh is galiyare kaa istemaal kar bharat nahin aa sakenge
 Apart from this, Sikh devotees of India going to Kartarpur will have to stay inside Kartarpur
 bharat se aae shraddhaluon ko coridor se baahar jane par manaahi hogi

 kartarpur par pakistan kaa nayaa pintara, army kaa farmaan- van ve hoga coridorpa army ke mutabik coridor ko banane main 6 maheene kaa vakt lagegaa
 After the corridor is ready, 4 thousand Sikh devotees will be able to come here daily in a day
 major general asif gafoor ne bhartiya media par bhi apni bhadaas nikaali
 He said that the efforts of Pakistan on the Kartarpur corridor were portrayed negatively by the Indian media

 Remembering the Emergency days, PM Modi said that Jethmalani will also be remembered for the struggle for the freedom of the people

 ) The Modi government is going to enact a law after the Supreme Court bans triple talaq together
 sheetakaaleen satr main centre sarkaar teen talaak ke khilaaf bill pesh karegi
 Muslim organizations are against this move of the Modi government
 muslim personal lau board kaa kahana he ki bijepi gujarat chunaav main raajnneetik roti senkane ke liye muslimon se jude mudde ko uthaa rahi he, taaki dhruvikaran ke jariye wo chunaav jeet sake
 Kamal Farooqui, a member of the Muslim Personal Law Board, said that the BJP wants to win the election by polarizing votes by raising issues related to Muslims during every election
 bijepi ne gujarat chunaav main phaayde ke liye teen talaak ke khilaaf kanoon vaala maamla uthaaya he
 Farooqui said that in the judgment given by the Supreme Court on triple talaq, the law making cases were five judges against 7 judges
 is tarah ye faisla alpsankhyak faisla tha
 In such a situation, the Modi government wants to govern three
 modi sarkaar muslim mahilaon ke haq main behatar kadam uthaanaa chaahati he, to muslim ladakiyon kii shiksha ko badhaava den
 47 percent of Muslim women are educated, but the government has no meaning with Muslim progress, they have to govern
 kamaal faruki ne kaha ki teen talaak ko roak lagane ke liye sarkaar koi kanoon banane ke liye muslimon ke jaankaron se raay mashwara karke karnaa chahie
 Just as the people of that religion were consulted and included in order to stop the practice of Sati
 isi tarah musalamaanon ke nijee kanoon main bhi muslimon kii raay se koi kadam uthaaya jaae
 Zafaryab Jilani said that Narendra Modi has spoken of enacting a law against triple talaq to bake political bread in Gujarat
 bijepi musalamaanon se jude mudde ke bahaane samaaj ko baantkar phayda uthaanaa chaahati he
 When the government brings the bill, the Muslim Personal Law Board will make its point after seeing it

 desh kii nai samprabhu samiti ne ravivaar ko red si state ke governor ko barkhaast kar diya tha
 Before 2019, the opposition has moved a no confidence motion against the Modi government
 desh main isse pehle 26 baar avishvaas prastaav pesh kiya ja chukaa he
 Congress brought a no-confidence motion during Atal Bihari Vajpayee's government 15 years ago
 us dauraan sadan main apane bhaashan main vaajapeyi sonia gandhi par bahut zyada gussa ho gaye the
 Seeing their anger, the whole house was shocked
 9 point main lagaae the aropavajpeyi sirf avishvaas prastaav se naakhush nahin the
 He was also very angry with Sonia Gandhi's speech at that time
 darasal tab sonia ne vaajapeyi sarkaar ko naakaabil or bhrasht kaha tha
 Sonia had accused the Vajpayee government in 9 points
 inkaa vaajapeyi ne behad tikhe andaaj main jawaab diya
 The no-confidence motion was debated in the House for two days
 tatkaaleen pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi ne raat ko 11 baje sansad main is par jawaab diya tha
 All the words that were gathered in a single foot, Sonia Gandhi cursed the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government with such words from the opportunity of debating the motion of no confidence in Parliament, which made Vajpayee angry
 avishvaas prastaav pesh karte samay sonia gandhi ke bhaashan kaa zikr karte hue unhone kaha ki jab maine shrimati sonia ji kaa bhaashan padhaa, to dang rah gaya
 He gathered all the words in a single paragraph
 unhone tanj kasate hue kaha ki bijepi kii aguwai vaali sarkaar ne khud dikhaa diya ki kaise wo naakaabil he, samvedanheen he, gaiyr jimmedaar he, or badi dhithaayee se bhrasht he
 He asked the question that you have this assessment of those who walk shoulder to shoulder in politics
 matbhedon ko prakat karne kaa ye kaisaa tarika he
 In the assembly, two or two Hathwajpayee reiterated Sonia's charge and said that it is the government which has betrayed the mandate
 unhone poocha ki kisne aapako jaj banaaya he? aap yahaan to shakti pareekshan ke liye taiyaar nahin he
 When the assembly elections are held, it will be two hands
 unhone kaha ki sabhy tareeke se ladiye, is desh kii maryaadaaon kaa dhyaan rakhie
 Abuse will not solve the country's problem
 avishvaas prastaav par vaajapeyi ne uthaae the sawaalsadan main bhaashan dete vakt vaajapeyi ne kaha ki is vakt avishvaas prastaav laane kaa mujhe koi kaaran hi nahin dikhaai detaa
 Addressing the house, Vajpayee said that if there is a situation of government collapse, a motion of no confidence comes
 kabhi sattarudh dal ke tuutane kii sthiti hoti he to avishvaas prastaav aata he
 Even in the normal state, it is used as a weapon to keep the government aware or to reveal its point of view, but i do not understand what the purpose is at the moment
 sarkaar ke tuutane kaa to koi sawaal hi nahin
 Vajpayee's words were also correct
 avishvaas prastaav gir gaya
 At that time the NDA got 312 votes, while the opposition could collect only 186 numbers

 How expensive it can be to take court-court lightly, who can tell it better than Vijay Kumar Aggarwal of Agra
 ek maamuli-si galati kii vajah se vijay ne chaar din agra jail main bitaye, or paanchavin raat dilli kii tihaad jail main, haalanki uske kanfusion ko dekhte hue supreme court ne use fouran reeha kara diya
 Actually, the case is about one and a half lakh rupees of the landlord
 vijay kumaar agarwal kaa agra main uske makaan maalik ke saath vivaad chal rahaa he, or supreme court ne vijay ko aadesh diya tha ki vah makaan maalik ko dedh lakh rupee de
 He was then asked to appear in court on November 10, but Vijay did not reach the Supreme Court on the date and the court issued non-bailable warrants against him, as well as the Agra police to appear in court on December 8
 Ordered
 5 disambar ko agra police ne use giraftaar kar liya or agra court ne use jail bhej diya
 The Agra police reached the Supreme Court on December 8, but due to delay, the court sent him to Tihar Jail in contempt of court
 mangalvaar ko dilli police ne jab vijay ko supreme court main pesh kiya, to justise deepak mishra or justise yuyuu lalit ne usase poocha ki aakhir vah 10 november ko court kyon nahin aayaa
 Vijay told the court that he had come to the court on the same date and had also made a court number eight pass, but later he came to know that this bench has shifted to court number six, and then he passed the court number six
 Built, but by then his case had come out
 vaise, vah shaam chaar baje tak court main hi rahaa or baad main usne court master se baat bhi kii
 Justice YU Lalit checked both her passes and accepted her statement as correct
 iske baad court ne use somvaar tak 50 hajaar rupee jamaa karaane ke aadesh die
 The court also ordered the police to release him immediately, but the policeman present in the court told Vijay that he would not release him without a written order
 vijay ne fouran isaki jaankaree bench ko di, justise yuyuu lalit ne pulicekarmi se kaha ki use vahiin se reeha kiya jaae
 Justice Deepak Mishra said that the court does not like to send people to jail in this way
 court ne apane aadesh main khaastaur par likhvaya he ki court kii kanfusion kii vajah se vijay taarikh par nahin pahunchaa or jaanch ke baad court uski baat se sahamat he

 Narendra Damodardas Modi has been busy here
 ve janata se samvaad main maahir hai or ab tak 300 se adhik reliyon ko sambodhit kar chuke hai
 No leader of his party has addressed such rallies
 ve model mukhyamantri hai, jinhone apane rajya ko vikaas kaa paryaay bana diya he
 And his fans say he will play an important role outside the state
 2002 ke sampradayik dange ateet kii kahani ban chuke hai or modi tab se lanbaa, bahut lanbaa rasta tay kar chuke hai
 At least that's what Modi thinks
 lekin gujarat 2002 kaa paridrishy us vyakti ke liye ek baar phir pareshaani kaa sabab ban gaya he, jo bharat ke janamanas main kisi-na-kisi rup main apni jagah bana chukaa he
 The Supreme Court has asked the Special Investigation Team (SIT) investigating 10 special cases of riots to delve into the role of Modi, his 11 cabinet colleagues, police officers and bureaucrats
 so, aadhunik vikaas ke pairokaar ko 2002 ke dangon main apni sarkaar ke khilaaf niskriyata yaa unamem kathith rup se shaamil hone ke aaropon ke jawaab main achaanak hi bachaav par utar aana padaa he
 Modi is known for doing the opposite in his favor
 lihaaja, ve supreme court ke aadesh ko bhi bhunaane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 They are giving the slogan of being victimized and martyred
 unke bhaashanon main lalkaar badhati ja rahi he
 And its political results are immediately visible
 bhaajapa kaaryakartaaon kaa ek tabaka, jo shuru main tikaton ke bantwaare se naakhush tha, us samay utsahit ho uthaa jab modi ne supreme court ke aadesh ke peeche kii ''rajnatik sajeesh'' kaa ''pardaafash'' kiya
 As expected, Ottavio Quattrocchi, the accused in the Bofors case, got a lot of Modi's clean chit from the recent CBI
 rajya main prachaar ke antim din unhone ek raily main kaha, ''yah mere khilaaf congress kii sajeesh he
 Kapil Sibal officially said in a television interview that i have to go to jail for the 2002 episode
 congress bhale hi sahamat na ho, lekin main bharat mata kaa betaa hum
 So, during the Congress rule, Bharat Mata's son will get jail and Quattrocchi will get bail (bail)
 '' ek duusari raily main unhone kaha, ''gujarat ke bahadur bete ke rup main main jail jane ko taiyaar hum
 Even i am ready to go to the gallows
 agar mujhe jail or faansee main se kisi ek ko chunane ke liye kaha jaae to main faansee chununga taaki gujarat kii seva karne ke liye dobaaraa janm le sakuun
 "leave this brave gesture among the public, the Supreme Court order underscores the fact that the legacy of 2002 can end the luster of this man of modernity who eats the vows of development
" congress ne pehle hi mukhyamantri ke istife kii maang kar di he
 Additionally, the court order will make it even more difficult for Modi to obtain an American visa
 unhen 2005 main bhi america visa dene se inkaar kar diya gaya tha
 The Special Investigation Team has to submit its report within three months
 yadi report main unhen puri tarah se nirdosh tehraaya jaataa he to modi rajnatik rup se or adhik shashakt hokar ubharenge
 And if a finger is pointed at him or his administration, his opponents inside and outside his party will use it

 jakiya jaafaree ke ek aavedan par aadhaarit he
 It is worth noting here that Ehsan was among the 38 people who were killed by a mob of Hindus in the Gulberg Society during the riots in the state
 
 Zakia, in his petition filed in 2007, alleged that Modi instigated riots and that the police investigation set up in several cases after the riots was just a sham
 us jaanch kaa makasad mukhyamantri, unke mantrimandaleey sahyogiyon, sheersh police adhikariyon or afasarshahon sahit kul 62 logon ko kisi tarah bachaana or nirdosh sabit karnaa tha
 
 jakiya chaahati hai ki mukhyamantri modi or anya logon ke khilaaf aapraadhik sajeesh or hatya ke aarope lagaae jaaen or un par mukadmaa chalaaya jaae
 On the other hand, staunch supporters of Modi allege that left-leaning human rights activists

 Officials outside Gujarat found that the picture of Gujarat is not as dangerous as these activists have presented
 '' dangon kii jaanch ke liye modi sarkaar dwaara baithaae gaye nanaavati ayog ne abhi tak ek aanshik report di he

 He is accused of inciting a Hindu mob to attack Muslims in Naroda Patiya, outside Ahmedabad
 iske pehle vishesh jaanch team ne ek up police adheekshak ko giraftaar kiya tha
 When the Special Investigation Team submits its report within three months, there will be new revelations in it
 usase phayda yaa ghaataa sirf ek vyakti ko hoga
 And that person is Narendra Modi, who is today one of the strongest leaders in the country
 ve kisi bhi keemat par us teen maheene ke keemtee samay ko vyarth jaaya nahin karnaa chahenge

 According to Aman Necessary Bukhari in Kashmir for talks, it is good if the separatists condemn the Amarnath Yatrapar terrorist attack, but i wish when the attack is on the common people, on the police, on the army, when the army camp is attacked If innocent people are killed, then condemn them at that time and tell them that this is also wrong
 unhone kaha ki jehad ke naam par jo log vahaan dehshat failaa rahe hai, un logon se bhi yah apil karen ki ve maahaul ko aman main badalen taaki baatcheet kaa maahaul ban sake
 Talks will only take place and the Kashmir issue will be resolved only when there is peace in Kashmir

 The biggest challenge for the police is currently four days in the investigation of fake degrees of Delhi Law Minister Jitendra Singh Tomar
 chaar din yani 96 ghanton kii remand
 In these hours, the police not only have to test all the charges against Tomar, but they also have to gather evidence, which can stand in the court
 yah or baat he ki is safar ke pehle padaav main hi use badi kamyaabi mili he
 Although the Delhi Bar Council and Delhi Police had been denying Tomar's claims since day one, but when the police team reached Faizabad on Wednesday about Tomar from Delhi, Ram Manohar Lohia took his steps in Awadh University, the facts of Tomar's claims like It came out in the open in the true sense
 police ne jab uniwarsity ke adhikariyon se grajuation kii degree ko lekar tomars kaa aamanaa-saamana karavaaya to aakhirkaar vahi baat nikal kar saamne aa gai jiskaa dar tha
 The media in-charge of the university made it clear in two words that the b
sc degree of his university with Tomar is not real but fake
 role number kaa nahin he koi vajoodtomar kii ore se diya gaya inrolment number kisi or chaatr kaa he
 The roll number on Tomar's marksheet also does not exist
 yahaan tak ki unki degree par uniwarsity ke kulapati yani vaais chancelar ke jo dastakhat hai, wo bhi farji hai
 However, according to police sources, the investigation started on Tomar is still the first stop
 tomars kii giraftaar se pehle unhen lekar kii gai police kii shuruaati inkvyri main tomars kii ek nahin balki takreeban vosari digriyaan farjipai gai thim, jo pehle sawaalon ke ghere main hai
 Preparation for next journey: Police is now preparing Tomar to leave Faizabad on his next journey
 ab jab purv mantri mahoday kii tamaam digriyaan hi sawaalon ke ghere main he to in digriyon ko hasil karne kaa unka tarika bhi yakeenan sawaalon main hi hoga
 This is to say that now the police is preparing to go to the bottom of the entire racket along with the investigation of these fake degrees, through which Tomar has obtained these degrees
 ab tak kii tafteesh se is baat ke sanket milane lage hai ki in sabake peeche kisi orgenised gang kaa hi haath he
 But the most important question before the police is whether Tomar got fake degrees and certificates as a client only, or was he directly related to this racket too? To put it simply, Tomar himself was not running a fake degree racket
 video clip or aropam aadmi party ne bhale hi apane netaa kii is giraftaar ko asanvaidhanik or gaiyrkanoonee qaraar diya he, lekin is babat jo video clip saamne ai he usase bhi saaf jaahir ho rahaa he ki police ne giraftaar ke vakt tomars ke saath jismani taur par koi jor-jabardastee nahin kii
 Four days, 3 states and 3 thousand kilometers journey
 dilli ke kanoon mantri rahe jitendra singh tomars ko lekar subut jutaney nikali police ke liye ye safar behad lanbaa he
 But the police have only 96 hours
 aise main ab police apane tamaam sawaalon ke jawaab naa sirf haathon-haath hasil karnaa chaahati he balki tomars kii ankhon ke saamne hi unhen bairiphai bhi kar lenaa chaahati he
 Read further, how Tomar became a minister from a minor lawyer
 
 
 sutron kii maane to police iske baad tomars ko lekar train ke raste sidhe faijabad se bhagalpur ke liye ravaanaa hogi or phir vahaan se munger jaaegi
 Actually, Tomar has claimed LLB from Tilka Manjhi University in Bhagalpur
 saath hi munger ke bisael college se elelbi kii padhai karne kaa
 Police will find out these claims as well as degrees
 chunki police ke paas vakt kam he, iske baad wo bundelkhand hote hue dilli ke liye ravaanaa hogi
 Tomar has asked the Bundelkhand University to get a migration certificate in 2001
 police kii tafteesh main is certificate kii jaanch bhi shaamil he
 Law Minister to Minor Lawyer: Those were the days when Tomar's celebrity was nothing more than a minor lawyer
 lekin vakaalat kii isi ranjish main ek duusare vakil ne tomars ke khilaaf morcha kya khol diya
 Tomar's first complaint of fake degrees was revealed in February this year
 ek wo din tha or ek aaj kaa din
 The trouble started against Tomar on February 4 this year, when another lawyer Santosh Kumar Sharma filed a writ petition in the High Court against him
 is rit pitishan main sharma ne unki biessi or elelbi kii digriyon ko farji qaraar dete hue inaki jaanch karne or unke khilaaf karrwai karne kii guzarish kii thi
 These were the days when Tomar was not far from becoming an MLA
 lekin iske baad vakt ne palati khai or tomars pehle aam aadmi party kii ore se vidhayak chune gaye or phir unke vakil hone ke daawey ko dekhte hue hi shaayad aam aadmi party ne unhen 13 march ko dilli ke kanoon mantri kii kursi saunp di
 The notice was issued till now, the High Court had issued notice to Tomar as well as Bar Council of India and Bar Council of Delhi in this matter
 baar council apane str par maamle kii jaanch shuru kar chuki thi
 But since the time had changed, the person complaining petitioned the High Court to withdraw his complaint
 lekin shaayad tab tak baat bahut aage nikal chuki thi or hai court ne shikaayat waapas karne se inkaar karte hue is maamle kii tah tak jane kaa faisla kiya
 For AAP, it seems that the fake degree has become a source of trouble for 'AAP'
 purv kanoon mantri jitendra tomars kaa maamla abhi ufaan par hi he ki isi bich farji degree ke ek or maamle ne museebataan or badha di hai
 Another AAP MLA is accused of having a fake degree of graduation
 vidhayak commando surendra apni degree sahi sabit nahin kar paae to mumkin he ki shaayad unka bhi hashr tomars jaisaa hi ho
 In fact, during the election, the commandos had declared themselves as pass outs from Sikkim University, while BJP leader Karan Singh Tanwar filed an RTI application in the university to find out his degree, he got a quick reply that he had Surendra There is no student named Singh
 rashtriya maanavadhikaar ayog ne (NHRC) dilli police ko malviya nagar main videshi mahilaon se badasluki maamle main purv kanoon mantri somnath bharti ke khilaaf 8 hafte main karrwai karne ke aadesh die hai
 The NHRC has also issued an order to take action against Somnath Bharti
 is par dilli police kamishnar bies bassi ne kaha, 'somnath ke khilaaf jo bhi kadam uthaane honge dilli police uthaaegi
 'significantly, in January 2014, when Somnath Bharti was the Law Minister, on January 15-16, the house of African women was raided in the window extension
 bharti khud aadhi raat ko vahaan gaye the or unka daawa tha ki videshi naagarik drugs or sex racket chalaa rahe hai
 He also pressured the police to conduct raids there, but the police refused to conduct raids, saying there was no warrant
 ise lekar bharti or police main bahut bahes bhi hui thi
 Delhi Police had registered a case in this regard on January 19 against unknown people
 is hangaame ke baad aam aadmi party kii sarkaar se bharti ke istife kii bhi maang kii gai thi
 Not only this, Bharti was identified by one of those foreign women
 supreme court ne buudhvaar ko kaha ki sardaar sarovar baandh project par kanoonee masale se koi hal nahin nikalegaa
 This will neither benefit those people, whose land has gone, nor the government
 yahaan tak ki sardaar sarovar baandh kii oonchai kaa kaam puraa chukaa he, lekin uskaa asar nahin dikh rahaa
 It would be better if the state government and Narmada Bachao Andolan come to court with a plan and practical solution
 tippaniyan In fact, the Supreme Court was hearing a petition of the Narmada Bachao Andolan, which seeks to order relief and rehabilitation for those who lost their land to the dam
 CJI khehar ne kaha ki is tarah mukademebaaji se kuch nahin hoga
 There is a need to find a practical solution for this
 haalanki rajya sarkaar kii ore se kaha gaya ki kaaphi log jameen lene ko taiyaar nahin he
 
 lekin court ne kaha ki sarkaar logon ko banjar jameen nahin de sakati
 Either the government should arrange for double compensation to the people
 ullekhneey he ki darasal sardaar sarovar baandh kii oonchai badhaane ke kaam main gujarat, maharashtra or madhyapradesh ke kareeb 45 hajaar logon kii jameen lee gai he
 a hearing on rehabilitation is going on in the Supreme Court about this
 darasal, supreme court narmada bachaao andolan kii yachika kii sunwaayee kar rahaa tha, jisamen baandh ke liye jamine kho dene vaale logon ke liye raahat or punarvaas ke aadesh dene kii maang kii gai he
 CJI Khehar said that litigation like this would do nothing
 iske liye prectical samaadhaan khojane kii jarurat he
 However, it was said by the state government that many people are not ready to take land
 
 But the court said that the government cannot give barren land to the people
 yaa to sarkaar logon ko dugana muaavja dene kii vyavastha kare
 It is worth mentioning that in the work of increasing the height of Sardar Sarovar Dam, about 45 thousand people of Gujarat, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh have been taken
 isi ko lekar supreme court main punarvaas ko lekar sunwaayee chal rahi he

 raashtrapati samet rajdhani dilli ke viviipi logon kii kaaron ke registration ko lekar daayar yachika par hoicourt ne niyam bataate hue centre sarkaar se detail states report daayar karne ko kaha he
 During the hearing on Monday, the High Court told the Delhi government's counsel that they have issued a circular in this regard, in which provision has been given for registration
 court ab maamle kii sunwaayee 26 farvari ko karegaa
 The NGO Nyayabhoomi has referred to the Yeyachika High Court
 suraksha ke maddenjar raashtrapati samet sanvaidhanik padon par baithe ganmaanya logon kii kaaron par rajyachihn ke badale registration number hone kii maang karne vaali yachika par hoicourt ne centre or dilli sarkaar ko rajyachihn lagane ke sambandh main niyamon ko pesh karne ke nirdesh die hai
 The High Court said that the current situation in this case should be investigated and the reasons for non-registration of these vehicles and the central and state government should clarify their position on the next hearing regarding the rules
 daramil,hoicourt menyachika lagaai gai he ki raashtrapati, uparashtrapati or kai sanvaidhanik padon par baithe longon ke liye istemaal honi vaali gadiyon kaa motor whical act ke tahat registration hi nahin karaayaa gaya he
 The petition states that such vehicles without registration are not only easy prey for terrorists, but if any of these vehicles cause an accident then the person or their family cannot even claim insurance
 iske alaava aam logon main bhi ek galat sandesh jaataa he ki demokrasi main niyam sabake liye baraabar nahin he
 Regarding the questions raised in the petition, Hahikourt said that there must be protocol and rules

 shukla ne kaha ki jahaan tak saptahanth main hone vaale do-do maichon kaa sawaal he to chaar baje vaala match ab paanch bajkar 30 minute se khelaa jayega
 This would cause a clash in the telecast time of both the matches but the broadcaster said that it had enough channels to broadcast both the matches simultaneously

 Five years ago on the morning of December 20, 2012, when the Himachal Pradesh assembly elections were counting, bjp's then Chief Minister Prem Kumar Dhumal telephoned his "good friend" Narendra Modi to wish him (also in Gujarat) Counting was taking place), perhaps in the hope that they might get some shine of "modi's magic"
 par aisa nahin hua
 Three hours later Modi managed to get a fourth consecutive term, but Dhumal was forced to congratulate his staunch opponent Virbhadra Singh of coming to power
 is pahari rajya ke matadaata jahaan 9 november ko 13veen vidhansabha chunane kii taiyaari kar rahe hai, vahiin bhaajapa satta main apni ''baari" kaa intjaar kar rahi he
 This expectation is not unnecessary
 darasal apatkaal ke baad 1977 main hue chunaav main shanta kumaar ne vaai
 s
 parmaar kii aguai vaali congress sarkaar ko dhul chataa di thi or soobe ke pehle bhagava mukhyamantri bane the
 Since then the Congress and the BJP have come to power alternately
 tabhi se himachaliyon ne kabhi kisi sarkaar ko lagaataar doosraa mauka nahin diya, sivaay 1985 ke ek apwaad ke, jab congress chunaavon se ain pehle daagdar tii
 Removes Ramlal and brought Virbhadra Singh
 magar is baar bhaajapa ke saath ek dikkat he
 Unlike the previous assembly elections, when the 49 lakh voters of the state were well aware of the options they had for the chief minister's chair, this time the saffron party was contesting elections without the face of the chief minister
 vah bhi tab jab aam taur par phiseddi rahane vaali congress ne 12 aktubar ko chunaavon kii tarikhon kaa elaan hone se pehle hi virbhadra ko apana mukhyamantri pad kaa ummidavaar ghoshit kar diya
 BJP insiders say the new election campaign led by the Center (delhi) is being contemplated to control factionalism in the state unit, which currently has two strong contenders for the post of chief minister Dhumal and Central Health Minister Jagat Prakash is divided in the camps of Nadda
 bhaajapa netaaon kaa kahana he ki mukhyamantri ke chehre kaa elaan nahin karke party adhyaksh amit shah yah bhi ummid kar rahe hai ki iske jariye purv mukhyamantri or purv kendriya mantri shanta kumaar kii bhagidaari pakki kii ja sakegi
 In Kangra (where the assembly has 15 of the 68 seats), his participation in the election campaign could be extremely important for the BJP, given Shanta's influence
 vahiin dhumal ke liye hamirpur (unka grih jila) se shimla kaa safar aasaan nahin he, jo ve pehle (1998 or 2007 main) do baar puraa kar chuke hai
 In 1998, Dhumal was brought on the last chance to evict Shanta, this time he may have to fight hard
 aisa isliye he kyonki rajya bhaajapa kaa bada hissaa nadda ke irdagird golband he, is bharose ke saath ki unhen hi agle mukhyamantri kaa taj pahanaaya jayega
 Nadda started his political journey as a student leader and first came to the Legislative Assembly from Bilaspur in 1993
 dhumal kii donon sarkaron main mantri rah chuke nadda ke baad main dhumal ke saath gahare matbhed ho gaye
 That is why he moved to Delhi where Modi inducted him into the Union Cabinet during his first cabinet reshuffle in 2014
 ve khuleam apni raay jaahir karne main saavdhaanee baratate hai, par bataur mukhyamantri shimla lautne kii apni khwaahish ko chhipate bhi nahin
 This time he may get a chance, this speculation rose further when the Prime Minister and the party president praised him
 modi, shah or rajnath singh ne pradesh kii jitani bhi yatraaen kin, sab main nadda kii khaasi ahmiyat rahi
 Apart from Dhumal and Nadda, many in the state unit also point to the "astonishing" Amit Shah's style when it comes to electing a chief minister — Manohar Lal Khattar in Haryana, Trivendra Rawat in Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh in Uttar Pradesh
 Yogi Adityanath
 ajay jamwaal ko lekar khaasi charchaa chal rahi he, jo abhi uttar-purvi rajyon main party ke sanghathan sachiv hai
 Originally a resident of Jogindernagar, Jamwal has been a full-time pracharak of the RSS and is in many respects the BJP test — he is a bachelor and a man of impeccable reputation
 jahaan shah ne naam kaa elaan karne se manaa kar diya he, vahiin log in sanketon ko lekar bhi utsuk hai ki abhinayta anupam kher ko shaayad mukhyamantri kii gaddi ke liye chunaa ja saktaa he
 "they are popular and are" boys of Shimla ", says a BJP leader
 " ve maanate hai ki yah afvaah tab shuru hui jab shimla gramin vidhansabha kshetra main juthogh ke najadik kher ke ek makaan kharidne kii khabar ai
 The BJP was expected to field Kher to challenge Virbhadra and his son Vikramaditya Singh in this constituency, but he was not given a ticket and now he is unlikely to contest
 mukhyamantri ke chehre ke bagaiyr bhaajapa, rajya ikai ke adhyaksh satpal singh satti ke shabdon main, ''modi ke karishme" par aas laga rahi he
 Also, the party is targeting Virbhadra Singh, who is facing trial in a CBI court on corruption charges
 chunaav ayog ne jis din chunaavon kii taarikh kaa elaan kiya, dhumal ne kaha, ''bhaajapa kii aitihaasik jeet hogi or rajya main mafia raaj khatm ho jayega
 "in his October 3 visit to the state, the Prime Minister set the tone for the bjp's election campaign in Bilaspur when he described the state's Congress government as a" bailable government "
 yah bhaajapa kii chunaav sabhaaon main takiya kalam ban gaya he
 This time it may be the bjp's "turn" to rule the state, but if you know Virbhadra, it is not that easy
 yah sach he ki is saal april main bhoranj ke vidhansabha upachunaav main bhaajapa ne aasaan jeet hasil kii thi, par vah chah maheene pehle kii baat he
 Many analysts say that the real impact of the problems created by traders and small shopkeepers due to demonetisation and GST will now be visible
 unka yah bhi kahana he ki virbhadra ke khilaaf bhrashtachar ke aaropon ko logon ke gale utaar paane main bhi bhaajapa ko mushkilon kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 Especially when the Congress is gearing up to question the alleged tremendous benefits to Jai Amit Shah
 vaise congress paanch saal se satta main hone ke boj ke saath chunaavon main utar rahi he, phir bhi isse inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa ki ye bataur mukhyamantri (yah unka chatha kaarykaal he) virbhadra ke shaayad sabase zyada kaamkaaj vaale saal rahe
 Apart from 70,000 jobs in the government sector, which Rahul Gandhi mentioned while declaring Virbhadra as the Chief Ministerial candidate in Mandi, the state has made progress in areas like infrastructure, education and health
 virbhadra kehete hai, ''rajya main jiro se ab 126 college hai
 "two months before the announcement of the elections, Virbhadra announced 10 new colleges, two hydroelectric projects, 100 rural roads and several new bridges — Rs 3,000 crore
 se zyada kii pariyojnaon—kaa udghaatan yaa shilanyas kiya
 One observer points out that the recent elections — for example, the fiercely contested elections in the Shimla Municipal Corporation — have shown that there is no wave in favor of either party
 iske baavjood shimla ke ek bhaajapa samarthak jor dekar kehete hai, ''log badlaav chaahate hai or vah ve hasil karenge!" kya yah ummid se paidaa hua bharosa he? koun jane, shaayad na bhi ho? This time the effect of good monsoon rains across the country is also visible in the reservoirs of big dams
 kendriya jal ayog (seedblusi) ke mutabik 18 agast, 2016 tak desh ke 91 bade jalaashyon main uplabdh jal kii maatra 96
 721 billion cubic meters (BCM), which is 61 percent of the total storage capacity of these reservoirs
 yah beete saal samaan avadhi main 109 pratishat or beete das saal kii samaan avadhi main ausatan 101 pratishat rahaa he
 Hydroelectric power was also availed, total storage capacity of these 91 reservoirs is about 157
 799 bisiem he, jo bharat kii kul bhandaaran kshamta 253
 About 62 percent of the 388 BCM is estimated to have been produced in India
 in 91 main 37 jalaashyon se 60 megawatt se zyada sthapit kshamta kii panbizli kaa laabh bhi liya gaya he
 The storage area less than last year includes Himachal Pradesh, Punjab and Rajasthan

 There is a stock of 41 BCM water, which is only 69 percent of the total capacity of these reservoirs
 in jalaashyon main beete saal kii samaan avadhi main bhandaaran 90 pratishat or beete 10 saal ke dauraan ausat bhandaaran 69 pratishat tha
 Thus this year storage is less as compared to same period of last year but is same as compared to average storage of same period during last 10 years
 10 saal ke ausat bhandaaran se behatarpurvi kshetra main jharkhand, odisha, pashchim bengal or tripura aate hai
 Here the total storage capacity of 15 reservoirs under the supervision of CWC is 18

 Currently, the total water storage is 10
 44 bisiem he, jo in jalaashyon kii kul kshamta kaa lagbhag 55 pratishat hi he
 Storage was 47 percent in the same period last year and 51 percent on average in the same period of 10 years

 Dussehra day is midday and politicians are at loggerheads over the decision to broadcast live on Doordarshan's speech on the annual foundation day of commentator RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat
 lekin soochna-prasaaran mantri prakaash javdekar jaraa bhi pareshaan nahin hai, unke paas sochane-vichaarne ke kai or gambhir mudde jo hai
 Assembly election campaign has opened in Maharashtra, and it is Javadekar's home state, so it becomes his special responsibility to help the party unit of the state
 philhal to ve neuyork ke medisson squaire garden main pradhanmantri narendra modi ke superhit bhaashan kaa video tepe hasil karke use om maathur ko saunpane ke upkram main jute hue hai
 Mathur is the party in-charge during the elections in the state and wants to display that speech in all 288 constituencies
 dashahara par mumbai main deraa daalane vaale ve iklaute kendriya mantri nahin hai
 Textiles Minister Santosh Gangwar and Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh, who are from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar respectively, have also left Mumbai to seek the party's help by giving up the temptation to live in their home states
 petroleum mantri dharmendra pradhan or railway rajyamantri manoj sinha bhi party chunaav abhiyaan mashinari ko chust karne ke liye rajya ke vibhinn hisson main deraa daale baithe hai
 The responsibility of coordinating his responsibilities rests with Sunil Bansal
 bansal vahi shaks hai jinhone uttar pradesh main vartmaan bijepi adhyaksh amit shah kii loksabhaa chunaav kii ranneetiyon ko anjaam diya tha or hindi hriday pradesh kii adhiktam siten bijepi kii jheli main daalkar tamaam rajnatik panditon ko hairat main daal diya tha
 This time too, Shah remembered Bansal and handed over the responsibility of party management in Maharashtra from the day the bjp-shiv Sena alliance broke in Maharashtra
 bansal 27 sitambar se hi mumbai main jame hue hai or unheen par rajya main modi ke chunavi kaarykram kii ruparekha taiyaar karne kii khaas jimmedaari he
 If there is any similarity between Mathur and Bansal's very busy and tedious routine from Alsubah to late night, then both of them are devoted to the assembly elections
 bansal ne hi bijepi ke kendriya karyaalay ko chunavi kaarykram kii yojana main badlaav karne ko baadhya kiya tha or maharashtra or haryana ke bich modi kii reliyon ke kaarykram ko baantne kii bajaae maharashtra main adhik reliyaan karne ko kaha tha
 Such a busy schedule for Modi was prepared only when he was in America, from where the approval of this program was taken from him
 lagata he, bijepi maharashtra main safalataa kaa koi mauka haath se jane nahin dena chaahati
 This election has become very important for the party
 isaki vajahen bhi bahut chuphi hui nahin hai
 The BJP won a landslide victory in the Lok Sabha elections in May due to the anti-incumbency wave of the ruling congress-ncp alliance for the last 15 years
 lekin shivasena se 25 saal purana gathbandhan tuutane ke baad jokhim or laabh ke sameekaran kaa anupaat kai guna bad gaya he
 There is no doubt that the risk has increased and the party realizes this
 yah jokhim apane saath kai nae aayam bhi lekar aayaa he
 The BJP is relying on the central leadership for votes instead of presenting its chief ministerial candidate in its traditional way
 modi phir akele jaadugar kii tarah saamne aae hai or chunaav abhiyaan unheen ke ird-gird kendrit ho gaya he
 They are expected to draw votes just like in the Lok Sabha elections
 postaron or parchon main ve hi pramukhataa se najar aate hai or nitin gadakari, devendra fadavis, vinod tavade or pankaja munde unke peeche hai
 The same strategy is being followed in Haryana, where elections are due on the same day
 party pramukh shah kuch siton ke liye maharashtra main gathbandhan ko bachaane aage nahin aae to haryana main bhi unhone chunaav se ek maheene pehle hi haryana janhit congress ke saath dosti ko tuutane diya
 BJP leaders are hopeful that they can easily win the elections of both the states this time by riding on the Modi wave that created history in the parliamentary elections
 lekin ve yah bhi bhalee-bhaanti jaanate hai ki ye chunaav parinaam modi par janamat sangrah ke rup main dekhe jaaenge, bhale hi unhen pradhanmantri bane kul jamaa chaar maheene hi hue hai
 If the good results are not there, then the air of Modi balloon will come out, anyway, due to the poor performance in the by-elections held after coming to power in Delhi, bjp's air has got spoiled
 india today group-sisero surveykshan ke mutabik bijepi jeet sakati he kareeb aadhi sinten (dekhen teble)bhagava kii taraf jhukaavcongress se tuutakar ensipi ke gathan ke baad se maharashtra kii raajnneeti bhi desh ke kuchhek duusare rajyon kii tarah thodi jatil ho gai he
 Later, when the two stood together against the alliance of the two saffron parties - BJP and Shiv Sena, this complication increased further
 lekin ab bilkul alag najaara he
 All of them are hurting on their own
 kshetreey rajnatik vafadariyon or itane vishaal pradesh kii vividhta ke chalate chunavi gananaa or jatil ho gai he
 a few weeks before the election, voters are confused because they thought they could vote with their eyes closed
 loksabhaa chunaav main matadaataaon ne shivasena-bijepi gathbandhan kaa purajor samarthan kiya tha
 But this time the race with two horses has suddenly turned into a four-cornered contest, which is enough to confuse the voters
 khaskar jab pichley chunaav main nayak banakar ubhari shivasena khud ko peedit ke rup main pesh kar rahi he, jo apane duusare saajheedaar kii ati mahatvakankshaon kaa shikaar ho gai he
 At a public meeting in Borivali in North Mumbai, Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray referred to the much-hyped slogan "achhe Din Aayenge", saying, "we were together in bad times, but when" Achhe Din "came, they excluded us
 gave
 ’’ ve congress-ensipi par hamale to karte hai lekin unka lagbhag aadha bhaashan khud ko maharashtra ke hiton ke aise pairokaar ke rup main pesh karne ko samarpit hota he, jiske saath dilli ke takht par baithe bade bhai ne dhokhaa kiya or apane ko aage le jane kii koshish kii he
 But Uddhav does not forget that this election is not just for "maratha Manoos", especially in the vast urban areas of mumbai-thane
 mahanagar kii jansankhya kii sanrachana main naatakeey badlaav aayaa he or matadaata suchi main gaiyr-marathi bhashiyon kaa dabadabaa he
 The BJP seems to be a better choice for Hindi and Gujarati speakers, which is why Thackeray had to give a speech in Hindi, even allowing two non-marathi candidates to speak
 babari masjid ke dhahne ke baad mumbai main machi hinsa kaa hawala dete hue udghav kehete hai, ‘‘agar shiv sainik aasapaas na hote to 1992 ke baad gujaratiyon ko mumbai chhodkar gujarat bhaagna padataa
 "of course, Shiv Sena is trying to garner sympathy
 bijepi yah bakhubi samajhati he or uski puri koshish rahati he ki shivasena ko sahanubhuti kaa ansh bhi na mil paae
 BJP strategists have asked their leaders not to attack the Shiv Sena, so that there is no sympathy for the Shiv Sena among the voters
 na sirf modi shivasena kii aalochanaon kaa jawaab dene se bache balki saarvajanik rup se shivasena ke sansthaapak bal thakare ke prati aadar vyakt karnaa na bhuule
 On the other hand, BJP leaders are happy to release the body from the Shiv Sena, because the anti-north Indian political agenda of the Shiv Sena had driven the North Indians away from the saffron alliance
 bijepi mumbai-thane kii sabhi 60 siton par chunaav lard rahi he, jabaki gathbandhan main rahete hue vah ek-tihaai siton par hi ladi thi
 Bansal is leaving no stone unturned to convert all these seats into victories
 uttar pradesh bijepi mahasachiv hone kaa puraa laabh uthaate hue ve vahaan ke netaaon ko un ilaakon main laa rahe hai, jahaan uttar bhartiya kaaphi sankhya main rahete hai
 Manoj, a taxi driver from Bihar, has lived in the slum area of bandra for the last 15 years, he says, "I voted for BJP in the Lok Sabha elections because of Modi, now only to vote for BJP in the assembly elections too
" i am thinking lekin is baar congress ko vot na dene ke maamle main hamaare samaaj ke log bante hue hai
 "but the complexity of Maharashtra's politics as you move out of the mumbai-thane area is seen as vivid
 rajya ke bade netaa bhi matadaataaon ko rijhaane kii koshish main maharashtra ke hiton or kshetreey aakankshaon kii baat karte najar aate hai
 As an example, as soon as you enter Aurangabad in Marathwada region, you see the missing voices in support of BJP
 is ilaake main bijepi ke pakke samarthakon ko bhi bharosa nahin he ki unki party akele dam par rajya main bahumat hasil kar paaegi
 They feel that BJP and Shiv Sena will have to join hands again to form the government
 shahari marathi matadaataaon kii duvidha kaa hawala dete hue pune main nijee kshetra main karyrat agjicutive santosh jamdade kehete hai, ‘‘is baar kisi bhi party ko apane dam par bahumat milane kii sambhaavna kaaphi kam he
 By the way, people are also surprised that if Uddhav Thackeray has to support BJP after the election, then why not vote for BJP itself
 ’’haath main dam nahibhagava kheme kii tufaani gatividhiyon or utsaahi ranneetiyon kii tulana main congress main utsaah or sphurti nadaarad he
 The party office at Mumbai's Nariman Point is deserted
 dashahara ke din mumbai ke akhabaaron ne agle do dinon main modi kii aath reliyon kii ghoshnaa kii, congress main control room ke prabharee kaaryakartaaon ko party adhyaksh sonia gandhi or upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ke abhiyaan program kii koi soochna nahin thi
 The Congress is left with a single tangle to woo voters after a bitter defeat in the Lok Sabha elections in the state, which it calls a transparent administration, although its ally NCP has been heavily accused of corruption
 shivasena se alag ho chuki bijepi kaa uttar bhartiya matadaataaon ke liye aakarshak vikalp bananaa satta virodh lahar ke neeche dabi congress ke liye sabase buree khabar he
 The party, which has been badly defeated in the Lok Sabha elections in Hindi-speaking states, has been reluctant to introduce either Sonia or Rahul in the mumbai-thane area, where Modi is popular
 desh kii sabase puraani rajnatik party ke paksh main agar koi baat he to vah iske mukhyamantri prithviraj chavaan kii saaf-suthri chhavi he, haalanki unhen ‘‘faisla na le sakane vaale mukhyamantri’’ kii chhavi se mukt hona he
 Political observers were shocked when Sharad Pawar's NCP broke a 15-year-old relationship with the Congress after breaking the bjp-shiv Sena alliance
 isse trishanku vidhansabha kii haalat main baari rajnatik ulatpher or nae gathjod banane kii sambhaavnaaon kii atakalein chal nikaleen
 But NCP insiders say that this is a decision taken by the party in frustration
 unke mutabik party netritv ne asantusht or naaraaz sthaneey netaaon ko chunaav tikat kii ummid main bijepi yaa shivasena kii god main jane se bachaane ke liye yah faisla liya
 Having overcome the fears of his Pant being shattered, Pawar's party is now raising the Maratha honor issue like the Shiv Sena, albeit in a different way
 sharad pavaar or modi ke bich shivaji ko lekar chale vaad-vivaad ko yaad kiya ja saktaa he
 Common enemies? Pawar instructs voters to be wary of the BJP that its remote-controlled leadership in the state cannot be trusted
 4 aktubar ko pune ke balewadi main prachaar abhiyaan shuru karte hue sharad pavaar ne kaha, ‘‘bala sahib ne ek aatm-sammaan vaala sanghathan (shivasena) taiyaar kiya tha
 He also used to say that Kamla Bai (the idiom for bjp's election symbol Kamal) has an alliance with the Shiv Sena, but it is also looking for other allies
 ’’yah bhi dilachasp he ki pavaar ne bhi shivasena yaa uske netritv par koi hamalaa nahin kiya
 Pawar and Thackeray thought it necessary to remind voters that the BJP lost badly in the by-elections after the Lok Sabha elections
 iskaa sandesh spasht haih modi lahar loksabhaa chunaav tak simit thi or maharashtra ke logon ko usee lahar main nahin thela ja saktaa
 The voters of Maharashtra are so confused that they feel empathy towards them
 pratidwandvi partiyon ne ek-duusare par aarope-pratyaropon kii aisi jhadi laga di he ki matadaata partiyon ke badale ummidavaaron par zyada dhyaan dene lage hai
 This confusion is more visible, especially in rural areas, where the network of Chinese cooperatives and educational institutions run by politicians affects the voters and due to this network many leaders of Congress and NCP can make their impact
 lekin bijepi netaaon khaskar modi or pankaja munde kii jansabhaon main umadi bheed ko agar sanket mana jaae to kaha ja saktaa he ki dusron ke liye bijepi ko haraana aasaan nahin he, khaskar is tathy ke maddenjar ki apane hi garh main pavaar or thakare kii reliyon main utani bheed nahin umad rahi he
 All believe that if the bjp-shiv Sena alliance had run with consent, it would have easily buried the flag of victory
 or ab lagbhag har kisi kii raay yah bhi he ki charconiya mukaable main vot bant jaaenge
 In the saffron-affected rural areas, the Shiv Sena has an upper hand, so voters in urban areas have no refrain from voting for the BJP
 congress or ensipi kaa vistrut network yah aashwaasan detaa he ki unhen abhi khaarij nahin kiya ja saktaa
 But the big question before the voters of Maharashtra is that they should follow the slogan of BJP, accept Modi's companionship and go with the Prime Minister and give the party a message to join hands with Shiv Sena again
 ab yah to aap jaanate hi hai ki arvinder kejariwal dilli main in dinon smog yaa kahen ki pradooshan ke halaat se kitna zyada pareshaan chal rahe hai
 It was a scandal in the leprosy from above that the NGT also rejected his aud-even formula

 After wavering on meeting Amarinder on Monday, Kejriwal has now requested to meet "captain" on Tuesday morning once again via tweet
 
 
 vaise kejri khud is baat ko lekar aashwast nahin hai ki amarinder unase milenge bhi yaa nahin
 
 
 Kejrawal has written in a tweet expressing surprise and questioning whether Amarinder Singh will meet him too
 
 In fact, the Kejri government had recently blamed the fires in Haryana and Punjab in a very loud noise for the worsening pollution situation in Delhi

 And Kejriwal wishes that he will meet both chief ministers on the same day
 
 However, Amarinder Singh, popularly known as Captain, had recently described Kejriwal as 'such a sick person who gives views on every issue, but he is not aware of any subject'
 
 
 amarinder ke isi bayaan ke baad kejariwal ne suzav dete hue kaha tha ki donon mukhyamantriyon ko raajnneetise upar uthakar dilli ke sankat kii ore dekhnaa chahie
 
 
 On this, Amarinder Singh responded to Kejriwal and said that no solution will be found to this problem by meeting the Chief Ministers

 lekin donon hi ek tarah se anuplabdh dikhaai pade
 
 
 Finally, Kejriwal removed the curtain from this confusion and tweeted that he will go to Chandigarh on Wednesday to meet Khattar
 
 At the same time, Kejriwal also mentioned in his tweets that Khattar refused to meet him during his two-day visit to Delhi
