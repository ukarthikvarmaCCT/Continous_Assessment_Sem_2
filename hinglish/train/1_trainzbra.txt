 We could not believe this, so we went to some other shops near the Central School in the area where a person told us that Manjha does not sell openly but is given on order
 usne kaha ham rakhte nahin hai, par mangava denge
 The shopkeeper asked us to come and see the goods after one hour

 The shopkeeper showed the sample that if it is liked, it will be available at wholesale price by August 14, but that too is not guaranteed

 The bitter question is now peeping through the pages of an English journalist's book

 The World Cup 2011 semi-final between India and Pakistan in Mohali, with both teams dreaming of winning the World Cup, was at stake
 ye match bharat ne jeeta or pakistan ne apane pradarshan ko ek bure sapane kii tarah bhula diya
 Those who watched the match still believe that India did not win in Mohali, but Pakistan was defeated
 pakistan kii fielding, bowling, batting or yahaan tak ki captaini bhi kisi ke gale nahin utari thi
 The only question in everyone's mind was that this match was not fixed? Now the revelations made by an English journalist in his new book have caused a panic in Pakistan cricket again
 aid hockins naam ke patrkaar ne daawa kiya he ki mohali main bharat or pakistan ke bich world cap ke semifinal kaa rigelt match shuru hone ke pehle hi tay ho chukaa tha
 The bookies had already known how and how many runs Pakistan is going to lose this match

 Recalling Hawkins' revelations and the outcome of that match, the then Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Ejaz Butt also believes that the World Cup semi-final should be investigated
 ye pehla mauka nahin he, jab world cap 2011 ke bharat-pakistan semifinal match main phixing kaa saaya laharaaya ho
 Earlier a British newspaper had made a similar claim but, then the ICC dismissed the allegations, saying that there was no need to conduct an inquiry into the indo-pak World Cup semi-final match, as there was no evidence of fixing in that match

 Congress said - These Khattar government's chief parliamentary secretary of Dramahariyana, Shyam Singh Rana, reached on a cycle rickshaw, sitting CMD OSD Jagdish Chopra and chief parliamentary secretary Seema Trikha
 udhar congress ne bijepi sarkaar kii iscycle muhimako drama qaraar diya

 The meeting to be held at the house of Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee on Saturday is considered to be very important, because once Mukul Roy walked out after the CBI interrogation, he did not take the name of mother, mother and mother, and said the same thing again and again
 He will continue to support the CBI in the investigation of the case in future also

 One of these things was this story of a fire accident that happened to him

 In this accident 65 percent of his body was burnt

 According to sources in the Ministry of Tourism, the government will keep only Ashoka and Samrat Hotel in Delhi
 baaki hotalon ko bikri ke liye nivida aamantrit kii jaaegi
 If a company is willing to take a hotel on lease, then the government can also consider it

 However, many hotels of ITDC are either running at a loss or their level has fallen drastically
 iskaa ek vikalp he ki sarkaar un par badi rakam kharch kare
 But the government will give their sale or lease on the other option

 Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi broke into Parliament today
 loksabhaa main apni team kii aguwai karte hue ve spikar ke asana ke paas pahunch gaye or sadan kii karrwai main baadha daali
 His demand was that an urgent debate should be held on the increasing communal violence in the country
 unhone ek din main do baar apni aawaaj buland kii jo haroonges he
 On his instigation, his party members also made a lot of noise and raised slogans against the government
 rahul gandhi ne vahaan yah bhi kaha ki spikar pakshpaat kar rahi hai
 He also said that at this time in the country it is being said that only one man is being heard
 rahul ke tevar or aakraamak bol hairaan kar dene vaale hai kyonki lok sabha spikar ke khilaaf amuman varisht saansad aisi tippanee nahin karte
 At a glance, it seems that Rahul is trying to become the voice of not only his party but the entire opposition and is trying to give a tough fight to the BJP
 lekin agar dhyaan se dekhen to lagata he ki rahul gandhi kii nigahen kahin or hai
 Actually, Natwar Singh's book has raised serious questions on the leadership of him and Sonia Gandhi
 natwar singh ne to saaf kah diya tha ki rahul ke andar raajnneeti ke liye aag nahin he
 That is, they do not have the energy that a person sitting in this post should have
 itnaa hi nahin unhone yahaan tak kah daalaa tha ki raajnneeti koi part time job nahin he
 Obviously, when a very old and experienced leader of the party says such a thing, then it will hurt
 rahul gandhi ke netritv par sawaal khadey hone lage the or gaahe-bagaahe party ke netaa un par kuch na kuch tippanee kar rah the
 In such a situation, it was difficult for Rahul Gandhi to sit silent because this would have raised questions on the leadership potential of the nehru-gandhi family
 or aisa hone bhi laga tha
 After the debacle in the elections, questions have started to be raised on Rahul's merit in the party itself
 rahul ko apni kshamta or apana josh dikhaane kaa samay aa gaya tha
 If he missed this opportunity, the arrow would have come out of his hand
 unhone vahi kiya
 He targeted the speaker for attacking the BJP
 jo log sadan ke kaam karne ke tareeke ko jaanate hai, ve yah bhi jaanate hai ki bina notice die vahaan khadey-khadey charchaa nahin hoti
 Then, where has communal violence increased in the country? This trend has been going on in Uttar Pradesh for a long time
 vahaan ke vidhaan sabha main charchaa kii maang unki party ne kyon nahin kii? baharhaal yah saaf he ki rahul gandhi apane ko party ke sheersh netaa ke rup main sthapit karnaa chaahate hai
 It is a question of survival for his political life because he will have to fight the war to raise his party around four
 ab unke paas na to vakt he or na hikoi vikalp
 It is a good thing that they have taken the front right late
 dedh sau saal puraani party ko ek jujharu navik kii jarurat he or rahul gandhi is bhoomika ko nibhaane ke liye kud pade hai

 piem bole-14 saal bhagwaan ram ne adivaasiyon ke bich bitaayejharkhand ke logon main bijepi sarkaar ke prati sammaan kaa bhav Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar may not be happy with the statements of RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav but he has given great relief to Tejashwi
 bihar sarkaar ne kaha he ki tejasvi yadav jab up mukhyamantri the to unke bangale main kharch niyamanusaar hi kiya gaya he
 This statement issued by the government is being seen as a clean chit
 bhawan nirmaan vibhaag ke pradhan sachiv chanchal kumaar jo mukhya mantri ke bhi pradhan sachiv ne ek sanvadata sammelan main kaha, 'paanch desh ratna maarg jo upmukhya mantri ke liye chinhit hai us par jab tak tejasvi yadav rahe us samay niyam ke anusaar raashi karch hui

 But the Bihar government feels that after this episode, now the minister has fixed the limit of how much the mla's bungalow will cost
 ab kisi mantri kaa bangala puri tarah 'centralined asi' yuktanhin hoga
 This decision taken by the Bihar government has many implications being extracted

 par bayaan se mache bavaal ko dekhte hue rajasthan ke mukhyamantri ashok gahalot ne khan se istipha maang liya he
 Before leaving for Delhi, Ashok Gehlot said that the statement of the minister is unfortunate
 jaise hi mujhe media ke jariye isaki jaankaree mili, maine raashtrapati se baat kii, khed jataayaa or iske baad mantri se spashtikaran maanga he
 No one has the right to make such remarks
 khan ke is bayaan kii chautarafa ninda hone ke baad unhone kaha, ‘jab indira gandhi or patil saath rahaa karti thim, to ve khaanaa or chaay banaaya karti thim
 i did not mean to express disrespect towards the President
 ’ unhone kaha ki main party kaaryakartaaon se kah rahaa tha ki ve bhi santosh rakhe or bina koi maang kiye party kii seva karte rahe
 Pratibha Patil is an example before us and we should follow her

 Sources say that it may be agreed to make Hyderabad the joint capital of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana
 kaha to yahaan tak ja rahaa he ki congress sansad kaa monsoon satr shuru hone se pehle hi isaki ghoshnaa kar sakati hen
 According to highly placed sources in the Congress, a decision in this context can be taken after the elections of local bodies in Andhra Pradesh on 31 July

 Why the demand for separate state: Telangana was merged into Andhra Pradesh on 1 November 1956
 telugana ke log iske paksh main nahin the
 The central government then, through an agreement, assured that Telangana would be given all administrative powers ranging from expenditure to various sectors
 yah qaraar 1969 tak ke liye tha
 Political profit and loss: There will be 21 Lok Sabha seats in Telangana and 21 seats in Andhra Pradesh

 Click here to watch Aaj Tak LIVE TV aap ek mahila hai or khub paisa kamanaa chaahati hai to ek shodh ne iskaa khaas tarika bataaya he
 It claims that only women like men can succeed in this matter
 ab aap soch rahe hoge kipurushon or mahilaon ke dimag main antar kya hota he?ve koun se gun hai jo donon kii soch kii prakriya ko alag karte hai
 So we tell you how to know if you have a mind like a man or like a woman
 kuch aadaton ke aadhaar par donon tarah ke dimag ke antar ko pahachaanaa ja saktaa he :agar aapke paas purush dimag he to-1) aap apane kaam kii list bananaa pasand karengi
 2) You will like to read non-fiction things more
 agar aapke paas mahila dimag he to-1) turant mili logon se bhi aasaani se baatcheet kar lengi
 2) You will not be interested in keeping technical information about new computers, cameras and any gadgets
 3) kisi paintig ko dekhakar aapkaa focus uski technic kii bajaay sundarataa par hogiis shodh main yah baat saamne ai he ki analitical dimag vaali mahilaayein un mahilaon kii tulana main 6
 3 per cent earn more, focusing their attention on feelings and thoughts
 ek research bataate hai ki yah baat spasht nahin he ki aakhir kyon purushon jaisaa sochakar log behatar karmchaaree ban jate hai
 But the reason for this is that men are traditionally paid more
 research main yah baat kahi gai he ki mahila or purush donon main hi purush dimag (tip-s) yaa mahila dimag (tip-e) ho saktaa he
 People with male brains (type-s) have more analytical information
 vahiin mahila dimag (tip-e) vaale logon main dusron kii feelings ko bakhubi samajhane kaa gun hota he
 Men who have 'male brain' (type-s) 9 compared to 'female brain' (type-e)
 8% zyada kamaate hai

 swami chakrapani ne yahaan tak kah diya ki 7 saal baad bhi mukademe kaa sarvocch adaalat main aage naa bad paanaa durbhagyapurna he
 Chakrapani said in the conversation till date that, "muslim parties are lying and their intention is only to postpone this decision so that they can prolong the case
" jabaki hai court ke faisle kaa hindi angreji or urdu main anuwaad karvaa kar hamane sabhi pakshon ke saath supreme court main bhi diya tha

 Die at the hands of any enemy but do not die at the hands of those girls or else you will not get heaven
 iesas ke sargana bagdadi kaa ye taaja farmaan he apane aatankwaadiyon ke liye
 And he had to issue this decree because the girls have taken up arms against ISIS in Baghdadi's stronghold itself
 jananath na milane kaa sataata he darwipije yani kurdish bhashaa main pipal protection unit
 While the YPJ was started to protect the Kurdish as well as ordinary townspeople from the ism's oppression, but ever since the girls in the YPJ have been slaying slrs, lmgs and rocket launchers such as Assassin, believe isis's bloodthirsty and heartless terrorists kitti-pitti has also gone missing because the awe of these girls chases the ISIS militants even after death
 or vajah ye he ki aatankwaadi ye maanate hai ki ladakiyon ke haathon maare jane par unhen jananath main bhi jagah naseeb nahin hogi
 ISIS has made the women fighters a victim of lust, even ISIS has killed many people, sometimes by beheading them, sometimes by burning them alive and sometimes by throwing them from the heights, and this includes the soldiers fighting against them, but the Kurdish Lady Brigade's Inn According to the brave people, these terrorists hate the fighters very much and the reason for this is that they do not get a place in heaven
 aise main jab bhi wipije yaa phir kurdish milicia kii koi ladi fiter in aatankwaadiyon kii changul main fansati hai, to aatankwaadi sirf uski jaan hi nahin lete, balki darindagi kii sari hadein paar kar uske saath balaatkaar bhi karte hai
 But it is said that if the jumper in maidan-e-jang is not afraid of death, then in the same way, this lady fighter also keeps a special intelligence ashala and a single bullet along with all her ill-will, so that when the poorest If there is no scope to get rid of the clutches, then with this pill, they take their own lives and free themselves from terrorists as well as all these worldly conflicts
 dar kaa phayda uthaa rahi hai ladkiyanye shaayad ladakiyon ke haathon maare jane ke aatankwaadiyon ke khauf kaa hi asar he ki is vakt iraq or syria main 10 hajaar se zyada ladkiyaan alag-alag ladi fiter brigade kaa hissaa ban kar iesas se takaraa rahi hai
 There are some fighters in these brigades who killed more than a hundred terrorists alone
 iesas ke aatankwaadiyon ke sabase bade khauf yani ladi brigade kii buniyaad padi, agast 2014 main, jab iesas ne iraq main sinjar kii pahadiyon main ja chhipe yajidi samudaay ko luutane or barbaad karne kii galati kii
 Since then, around 10,000 girls in countries like Iraq and Syria have been fighting ISIS militants as part of the separate Lady Fighter Brigade
 yazidiyon par dhaae julm kaa nateezadrasal, agast 2014 main iesas ne jab iraq main pair pasaarne kii shuruyaat kii, to unhen vahaan ke alpsankhyakon main gine jane vaale yajidi birdari ke log hi sabase soft torget lage
 Therefore, these terrorists selectively started looting and killing the Yazidis
 tab iesas ke julmo-sitam se ghabara kar yazidiyon ne jaan bachaane ke liye sinjar kii pahadiyon kaa rukh kiya, lekin iesas ne vahaan bhi unka peechha nahin choda or yahaan se takreeban 5 hajaar logon ko agava kar liya gaya, jinamein auraton or bacchon kii bhi ek badi taadaad thi
 The Yazidi women took up arms
 Now the Yazidis had only two ways to either accept ISIS or accept Islam or die painstakingly, but the Yazidis did not give up hope and this is where the Yazidis' confrontation with ISIS started
 She continued to grow with each passing day
 chunki aatankwaadiyon ne yazidi mahilaon ko hi sabase zyada tadpaaya tha, yazidi ladakiyon ne hathiyaar uthaane main der nahin kii
 Rihanna rescued ISIS six, while in Iraq, apart from Syria, the story of zulmo-sitam was similar
 vahaan cobaniyon ne iesas ke khilaaf morcha khol rakhaa tha or inhen cobani ladakiyon main ek thi rihana, duble-patale or nate kad kii is ladki ne apane jite-ji aatankwaadiyon ke aise chakke chhudaae ki wo dekhte hi dekhte ek public figure ban gai
 According to a rough estimate, this girl alone put more than a hundred ISIS terrorists to death before she was killed at the hands of ISIS
 rihana kii shoharat kaa andaja isi baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki haath main gan liye victory yani jeet kaa sin banaati uski is tasviir ko jahaan logon ne lakhon baar dekha vahiin hajaaron baar twit bhi kiya
 But the fear of ISIS being killed at the hands of girls gave women a new impetus to fight against ISIS
 dekhte hi dekhte donon mulkon main alag-alag ladi brigade ne iesas ke chakke chhudaane shuru kar die
 In one such brigade, the YPJ overtook ISIS in Syria from many places under its occupation and killed hundreds of terrorists
 ab haalat ye he ki parivaar kii jimmedaariyon se baahar nikal kar bullate pruf jacket pahane or haath main khaufnak aslhe liye ladi brigade kii ladkiyaan jahaan duniya bhar ke liye ek vismay or achraj kii kahani ban chuki hai, vahiin syria or iraq jaise mulkon kii ek aam tasviir
 Seeing Kurdish lady fighters coming towards you in Syria, ISIS militants flee under the rump
 vajah vahi he, aatankwaadiyon ko ye lagata he ki agar wo kahin in auraton ke haathon maare gaye, to unhen jananath main bhi jagah nahin milegi
 In such a situation, these girls are now getting stronger in maidan-e-jung against ISIS
 dilli chunaav main bijepi ko 'deraa sachcha sauda' kaa saath milane ke baad ab aam aadmi party ko bhi jama masjid ke shahi imam kaa saath mil gaya he
 The Shahi Imam of Jama Masjid has appealed to the Aam Aadmi Party to vote in the Delhi elections
 shuukravaar ko jama masjid ke shahi imam ahamed bukhari ne dilli ke musalamaanon se ye apil kii ki wo bijepi or congress ko vot naa dekar is baar aam aadmi party ko vot karen
 This appeal of the Shahi Imam may benefit the Aam Aadmi Party in the Delhi elections
 haalanki shahi imam kii is apil par AAP ke kisi netaa kii pratikriya nahin mil pai he
 Even before the elections in the country, the Shahi Imam has been seen standing with many parties
 gauratlab he ki loksabhaa chunaavon main bhi shahi imam ne desh ke musalamaanon se congress ko vot karne kii apil kii thi
 At the nda's Mega Sankalp Rally (NDA Rally) held in Patna, Prime Minister Narendra Modi (PM Modi) praised CM Nitish Kumar in a similar way, and on the other hand, attacked the opposition parties fiercely
 piem modi ne kaha kibihar main vikaas kii raftaar ko teji mili he
 Nitish Kumar has given a new direction to Bihar
 patna main metro shuru hone vaali he
 Many steps have been taken towards making Patna smart
 bihar ko jis sthiti se baahar nikaala wo prashansaneey he
 The NDA government is working to ensure that the Panchadhara of development in Bihar i
e
 education for children, earning for the youth, medicines for the elderly, irrigation to the farmer and hearing of the people is ensured
 bihar ne vikaas kii jis raftaar ko pakadaa he, wo or gati pakade iske liye centre kii NDA sarkaar ne nirantar prayaas kiya he
 a few days ago, projects worth more than 30 thousand crores were given to Bihar in Barauni
 ye bihar ke vikaas ke liye kiye ja rahe nirantar prayaason kii ek jhalak bhar thi
 The PM said that the roads of villages and cities here, the national highway here has been widened
 jo puraane pul hai unako sudhara ja rahaa he, nae fliours kaa nirmaan kiya ja rahaa he
 The plunder which was this, has shown courage to stop it
 piem modi ne kaha ki bihar main chaare ke naam par kya-kya hua he, ye bihar ke log bahut behatar tareeke se jaanate hai
 Targeting opposition parties, PM Modi said that those who were running their shop after snatching the poor are upset with the watchman
 isiilie chaukeedaar ko gaali dene kii sajeesh chal rahi he
 You can be sure, your watchman is alert in every way
 suraksha chaahe garib kii ho yaa desh kii, desh par buree najar rakhane waalon ke saamne aapkaa ye chaukeedaar or hamaara NDA gathbandhan diwaar banakar khadaa he
 The time from 2014 till now was to complete the basic facilities of the country and now, from 2019 onwards, it is time to take the country to a new height in the 21st century
 unhone kaha ki ab bharat apane vir javaanon ke balidaan par chup nahi rahata, chun chun kar badla letaa he
 The Prime Minister said that all of you are witnesses, the capable army of our country is engaged in crushing terror
 chaahe wo seemaa ke bheetar ho yaa baahar, aise samay main desh ke bheetar hi kuch log kya kya kar rahe hai? desh kii sena kaa manobal badhane kii bajaay wo aise kaam kar rahen hai, jisase dushman ke chehre khil rahe hai
 PM Modi said that when there was a need to talk in unison against those running the factory of terror, 21 parties had gathered in Delhi together to pass a resolution condemning Modi, against the NDA government of the Center
 vipakshi dalon ke netaa hamaare javaanon ke parakram par andeh kar rahe hai

 ve apni raajnneeti karte rahen, modi sabake liye vikaas ke kaam karata rahegaa
 Now the new India is moving forward with new methods and new policy
 saal 2018 main niti ayog ne kaha tha ki bharat 'itihaas kii sabase bhayaavah jal sankat' se jujh rahaa he
 600 million people are suffering from water shortage every day
 kareeb 2 lakh log har saal saaf peyajal na milane se mar rahe hai
 75 percent of the houses in the country do not have water supply
 yah bhi chetavanee di gai thi ki 2030 tak pani kii killat or vikaraal ho jaaegi
 Every other person will lack water
 isse desh kii jidipi main 6 fisadi kaa nuksaan hoga
 In 2018 itself, the World Bank said that there is a direct relation between water availability and poverty
 vishwa bank ke mutabik desh ke un shaharon main jahaan bhoojal 8 meter se neeche he, vahaan garibi 9 se 10 fisadi zyada he
 a year after the NITI Aayog report, the central government has created a new ministry called Jal Shakti
 iskaa makasad he 2024 tak gramin ilaakon ke har ghar main jal sangrakshan or prabandhan ke saath pipeline ke jariye peyajal pahunchaana
 Whereas in 2017, the central government's mission was that by 2030, it would deliver drinking water through pipelines to every house in the country
 iske alaava 2009 main mishan banaaya gaya tha ki 2017 tak rashtriya gramin peyajal yojana (NRDWP) ke tahat gramin ilaake ke har vyakti ko shuddh peyajal pahunchaaya jayega
 Old experience: lack of planning and delivery mechanism: The Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) audited the NRDWP and reported in its 2018 report that the plan to deliver pure drinking water to the people by 2017 was huge in planning and implementation Was lacking
 jisaki vajah se tay lakshya kii prapti nahin ho saki
 According to this report, only 8 per cent of the households in rural areas got access to drinking water
 vah bhi sirf 40 litre prati vyakti prati din kii dar se
 5 of the country between 2012 and 2017
 5 fisadi gharon main peyajal pahunchaa
 That too at the rate of 55 liters per person per day
 isamen 81,168 karod rupye kharch hue
 Only 18 via pipeline in rural areas
 4 fisadi gharon main hi pani pahunchaaya ja sakaa
 This was far below the target of 50 per cent
 desh ke kul 16
 Water could be transported through pipelines in 8 percent of the households
 jabaki iskaa tay lakshya 35 fisadi tha
 17 as per CAG report
 26 lakh kul gharon main se sirf 4
 In 67 lakh households, people had to face water scarcity
 iske peeche sabase bada kaaran tha bhoojal main kami, gunvattta sambandhi maanakon main laaparvaahee, jalsroton kii kami or supplai kaa sahi prabandhan
 In all water-related schemes, 98% of the scheme did not take into account how surface water will be used
 sabhi kaa dhyaan bhoojal par tha
 Therefore there is a decrease in ground water
 kendriya bhoojal board ke anusaar 2007 se 2017 tak desh ke 61 fisadi kuon main pani kaa str kam ho gaya he
 NITI Aayog's 2018 report also mentions that the scarcity of ground water in the country is becoming a national crisis
 kyonki 60 fisadi rajya jalastr kaa dhyaan nahin rakh rahe hai
 Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Rajasthan, Haryana and many other states are the worst case in this case
 in rajyon kii 60 karod kii aabaadi pani kii killat se jujh rahi he
 Dirty water is also a major problem, due to which 20 percent of the country's population keeps getting sick and about three-fourths of the country's population is affected
 desh ke sabhi jilon main se aadhe jile yaa to bhoojal kii kami se jujh rahe hai yaa phir gande pani kii samasya se
 According to the CAG report, the NRDWP scheme failed because they lacked planning and delivery mechanisms
 21 rajyon ne jal suraksha yojana or samuhik bhagidaari par koi yojana banaai hi nahin
 There is no coordination between the agencies working on water conservation, distribution and management in the country, National Drinking Water and Sanitation Council, State Water and Sanitation Mission, State Technical Agency, Source Finding Committee and Block Resource Center
 jal sanchayan, prabandhan or vitaran main yojanaayen raheen vifaljalsroton ke kuprabandhan kaa sabase bada udhaaharan chennai he
 The taps have dried up there
 yahi nahin is saal tamilnadu ke anya hisson ko bhi bhayaavah garmi or jalsakant se jujhna padaa he
 Not only this, Chennai has also suffered from water related natural disasters earlier
 chennai main aisi aapadaaen 1943, 1976, 1985, 1998, 2002, 2005 or 2015 main aa chuki hai
 The 2017 CAG report also stated that plans for rainwater harvesting have also failed
 agar desh kii sarkaar or logon ne jal ko lekar apni praathamiktaayen nahin badalin to 2009 main ai NRDWP ko lekar kaig or 2018 main ai niti ayog kii report kii bhavishyavaanee sach sabit ho sakati he
 The NRDWP aimed to formulate a sustainable plan to supply pure drinking water, but failed
 aise main kaig ne salaah di thi ki yojanao main salanaa ection plan or samuhik bhagidaari ko shaamil karnaa chahie
 Then the plans will be able to work to the level at which they should be
 2012 kii rashtriya jal niti or centre sarkaar kii nitiyon main samay-samay par renwater harvesting, jal sanchayan, bhoojal ke vaid upyog, jal sangrahaniyon ko waapas bharne aadi par nirdesh aate rahe hai
 Reliable and appropriate data should be obtained To overcome the problem of water, first of all it is most important that we get reliable and appropriate data
 abhi yah badi chunauti he
 The NITI Aayog says that all the data available about water in the country are very limited
 gharelu or audyogic jal upyog ko lekar maujuud data behad kharaab gunvattta kaa he
 Data collection methods are also outdated
 jal shakti mantralay ke liye bada kaam yah hoga ki vah bharosemand or upyukt aankaden jutaaye, logon ko shuddh peyajal dene ke liye upyukt sansthagat tantra kii rachana kare
 Include action plans and collective participation in the plans
 chhath parv se pehle BJP pradesh adhyaksh manoj tiwari ne kaha tha ki parv ke baad bhi MCD or BJP kaaryakarta milakar yamuna ke tamaam chhath ghaaton kii safai abhiyaan karenge
 But interestingly, neither the employee from MCD nor any MCD machine came even at the same Sonia Vihar Ghat, where BJP state President Manoj Tiwari had spoken about this campaign, despite mp's statement at the same Sonia Vihar Ghat
 So only 25 to 30 BJP workers
 hona to ye tha ki sonia vihaar ke is ghat par MCD karmchaariyon or BJP kaaryakartaaon ko milakar safai kerani thi, magar jute to mahaj 25 se 30 kaaryakarta
 Now the question arises that when MP and state president Manoj Tiwari from the same area said that MCD and BJP will do cleanliness together, then why was it not done? After all, why did the local BJP corporation councilor Sushma Mishra not send the cleaning materials of MCD employees and MCD to the ghat? On this, BJP Purvanchal Morcha president Manish Singh said that we will find out why the MCD was not involved in this drive
 bjppurvamcala morchoudhyaksh ne bhi mana ki yamuna ke mudde par raajnneeti thik nahi he
 On the insistence of the activists, MCD Chairperson of Shahdara Zone, Pramod Gupta, came on the spot and he also tried his hand in the cleanliness drive
 MCD ke is swachhata drive main shaamil naa hone ke sawaal par unhone kaha ki thodi der main hamaari puri team aegi or safai karegi
 But till today the team stopped there and waited for 45 minutes, till then no MCD team came there, only the reverse zone chairman left from the spot
 jaahir he manoj tiwari kii sansadeey seat par MCD or BJP ko apane aapasi siyaasi takaraahat kii phikr he na ki yamuna kii safai or apane pradesh adhyaksh ke safai bayaan kii, kyonki gandi yamuna gavaahi de rahi he ki gandagi kaa ambaar beshak uske pani ko mailaa kar rahaa he, lekin is tarah kii siyaasi gandagi bhi yamuna ke mailepan kii vajah he

 lalu ne kanhaiya kumaar kaa zikr karte hue kaha ki ye log deshadrohi nahin, balki bijepi ke log deshadrohi hai, kyonki inke shashan main srinagar main pakistani jhande fahraaye ja rahe hai
 Both Nitish and Lalu strongly targeted the BJP on this occasion

 Raja, in his 17-page note, said that he and the Prime Minister had correspondence on several issues related to the telecom sector on November 2, 2007 and after that both of them had a personal discussion on the subject
 unhone jepisi ko 13 march ko bheje apane note main kaha, in charchaaon main yah sahmati bani ki sanchaar or soochna praudyogiki mantri tatkaaleen videshmantri pranab mukherjee se baatcheet karenge, kyonki vah spectrum khaali karne par banaae gaye mantrisamooh kii adhyakshata kar rahe the

 Raja said that the Solicitor General defended this press release for two years in different courts and did not question its authenticity
 unhone kaha ki mukherjee se baatcheet ke uddeshy se vaahnavati ne ek note taiyaar kiya tha, jisamen atirikt spectrum aavanton ke liye graahak aadhaar maandand, dohari praudyogiki kaa vishay, spectrum aavanton kaa tarika or nae doorsanchaar licenson kaa mudda tha

 unhone kaha ki usee din unhone bhi mukherjee tathaa vaahnavati se baatcheet ke aadhaar par pradhanmantri ko ek patr bheja
 Taking a dig at the Attorney General on the testimony before the JPC, Raja said that Vahanvati's claim that she was not involved in any policy decision of the government was not correct
 mukherjee ko bheje gaye vaahnavati ke note main doorsanchaar vibhaag kii sampurna niti kaa saar tha
 Raja said that Vahanvati's plea is baseless and unreliable that the dot had approached her with a press release to find out if there was any stay in any court on the issue of license

 'amended press release is accepted', when was this sentence recorded in the file? In response to this specific question of JPC, Raja said that it was written before the file was sent to Vahanvati
 vaahnavati ne jepisi main kaha tha ki 2ji licenson se jude press note ko raja ne aakhri samay main ek alag kalam se badal diya tha
 Raja said, after getting my approval on the note placed by the dot officials and instructing them to take the opinion of the Solicitor General, the final paragraph of the draft press release was given on file and the Prime Minister was given prior approval
 Was not in line with the message given in unhone kaha, isse license pradaan karne kaa puri tarah nayaa tarika hi izaad ho jaataa

 He said, on the basis of this fact, making such a big claim of creating forgery or fabrication was done without understanding any law

 Raja, who could not appear before the JPC in private, said in response to the committee's questionnaire that the Prime Minister and the then Foreign Minister Pranab Mukherjee were informed about the policy of licensing

 He said in his note sent to the JPC on March 13, in these discussions it was agreed that the Minister of Communications and Information Technology would talk to the then External Affairs Minister Pranab Mukherjee, as he was chairing the Group of Ministers on vacating spectrum
 raja ne kaha ki atirikt spectrum ke aavanton ke aadhaar maandand, dohari praudyogiki ke vishay or nae licenson ke vishay par unke or mukherjee ke bich disambar, 2007 main baatcheet hui thi
 Giving details of the sequence of events prior to the allocation in January 2008, Raja said that the then Solicitor General Vahanvati was also present during these talks and also had issues before the Telecom Disputes Redressal and Appellate Authority (TDSAT)

 raja ne kaha ki salisitor general ne isi press vijyapti kaa do saal tak alag-alag adaalaton main bachaav kiya or isaki pramanikta par koi sawaal nahin uthaaya
 He said that for the purpose of interacting with Mukherjee, Vahanvati had prepared a note which contained the customer base criteria for additional spectrum allocation, the subject of dual technology, the mode of spectrum allocation and the issue of new telecom licenses

 The decision of demonetisation has brought the maximum political clout in West Bengal
 ek taraf jahaan, mukhyamantri evam trinmul congress kii pramukh mamata banerjee notebandi par pradhanmantri ke khilaaf jhanda buland karke deshbhar kii yatraaen kar raheen hai, vahiin kolkata kii ek masjid ke imam ne pradhanmantri par logon kaa thagne kaa aarope lagaate hue pradhanmantri kaa sir mundakar unka munh kaala karne vaale ko 25 lakh rupee kaa inaam dene fatwa jari kiya
 Here the police and BJP have registered cases against each other on the politics of demonetisation
 bataa den ki beete shanivaar ko kolkata kii tipu sultan masjid ke shahi imam saiyad mohammad nurur rahamaan barkati ne ek kaarykram main bolte hue kaha ki pradhanmantri ne desh ke aam logon ko notebandi ke naam par thaga he
 Due to this, people are facing huge problems
 isliye desh kaa aam aadmi nahin chahta ki narendra modi desh ke pradhanmantri bane rahen
 The Shahi Imam said that only Maulana, Sufi, Sikh or saints keep a beard and do public interest, but the Prime Minister only has a beard to cheat people
 khaas baat yah he ki jis samay imam yah fatwa jari kar rahe the us samay trinmul congress ke saansad idrish ali unki saath vaali seat par hi baithe the
 The BJP retaliated by demanding that the Imam be arrested
 is bare main party kaaryakartaaon dwaara police main imam ke khilaaf ek report bhi darj karai gai he
 West Bengal BJP chief Siddharth Nath Singh has demanded the Chief Minister to arrest the Imam
 fatve ke baad aalochanaon main ghir saansad idrish ali ne shahi imam ke fatve par maafee maangane se saaf inkaar karte hue kaha ki ve fatve par maafee kyon maangen, notebandi ke dauraan linon main khadey 125 logon kii maut ho gai or pradhanmantri kii taraf se kaai afsos tak nahin kiya gaya
 Idrish said, 'fatwa is its place, i have no fear of it
 or rahi police main report kii baat to maine kya kiya he
 
 ' However, the BJP does not want to miss any opportunity to attack TMC on this occasion
 bhaajapa ke rashtriya sachiv rahul simha ne is mudde par patrakaron ko bulaakar kaha ki is fatve ke peeche mukhyamantri kaa haath he
 He said that the imam and the TMC MP should be arrested immediately, or they will move the court against it
 udhar, idrish ali ne park street police stesan main jaan se maarane kii dhamkee milane kaa maamla darj karavaaya he
 Idrish alleges that he is being threatened over phone from Kerala and Dubai that if he says anything against the Prime Minister, he will be killed
 tippaniyan Toha Siddiqui, the Imam of Furfura Sharif, another Muslim religious teacher, strongly criticized the edict of Shahi Imam Nurur Rahman Barkati, saying that he should not fire the fire, if there is a fire, it should be poured water, not To promote it further
 unhone kaha ki unhen vishwaas nahin he ki mamata banerjee kisi aise fatve kaa samarthan karengi
 Let me tell you that earlier, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had directly blamed the Prime Minister for the deaths of people during demonetisation

 " Virat Kohli batted with restraint against Pakistan and Sri Lanka and brought the team out of trouble
 gendbaaj ummid se behatar pradarshan kar rahe hai
 Apparently just before the ICC World T20, captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni is seeing his dream of a third world title come true with the superb form of the team
 tippaniyan He said "with this team in T20 format we can play anywhere in the world
 do spinners, 3 simmers or jarurat padane par part time gendbaaj
 This is the perfect combination
 agar kuch atirikt ran ban bhi jate hai to hamaari batting number-8 tak he
 This team can play under any circumstances, outside India or India
 behad santulit team he
 " to kya isisi world T20 ke baad dhoni sanyas ke elaan kar denge

 See what Dhoni says, "you are not going to get rid of me so soon
 bangladesh ko aage bhi meraa saamana karnaa padegaa
 "it is not easy for any team to stop the rhythm of this team India
 pakistan or srilanka ke khilaaf viraat kohli ne sanyam ke saath ballebaaji kii or team ko sankat se ubaar laae
 The bowlers are doing better than expected
 jaahir he isisi world T20 ke thik pehle team ke shandaar form se captain mahendra singh dhoni tisare vishwa khitaab ke apane sapane ko sach hota hua dekh rahe hai
 The comments unhone kaha "T20 formet main is team ke saath duniya main ham kahin bhi khel sakate hai
 Two spinners, 3 simmers and a part time bowler if needed
 yah bilkul sahi combination he
 Even if some extra runs are scored, our batting number is up to 8
 yah team kisi bhi halaat main khel sakati he, bharat yaa bharat ke baahar
 It is a very balanced team
 " So will Dhoni announce retirement after ICC World T20
 is baar is sawaal kaa jawaab jaanane kii utsukata ek bangladeshi patrkaar kii thi
 This time Mahi did not get angry on this question

 pathankot hamale ne seemaa paar se aatankwaad kii badhati ghatnaon ko phir se saamne laa diya he'unhone kaha ki pakistan ko lekarbharat sarkaar kii policysaaf he
 India wants friendly relations with all its neighbors including Pakistan but terrorism will not be tolerated in any way
 pathankot main hua hamalaa baatcheet ke raste main baadhavikas swaroop ne kaha, 'haalanki is mudde par zyada kuch kahana jaldbaaji hogi
 He said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Lahore has raised a new hope in india-pakistan relations
 modi kaa auchak daura dwipaksheeya vaarta ke liye sakaaratmak sanket ke taur par tha lekin pathankot main hua aatanki hamalaa is baatcheet ke raste main baadha ban gaya
 According to Indian handlers' identities, the entire plot of the Pathankot attack was hatched in Markaz, Punjab, Pakistan
 bharat ne un handlers kii pahchaan kar lee he jo pakistan main baithkar aatankiyon ko nirdesh de rahe the
 They have been identified as Maulana Ashfaq Ahmed, Hafiz Abdul Shakur, Qasim Jan and MM Azhar

 chaar dinon tak chalaa tha oparationapunjab ke pathankot main 2 janvari ko subah kareeb 3:30 baje chah aatankiyonne airforce base par hamalaa bolaa tha
 After four consecutive days of operation, the security forces killed 6 terrorists
 is dauraan 7 jawan shahid hue jabaki kai ghayal ho gaye
 The terrorists came for the purpose of damaging the planes kept in the airbase
 bharat sarkaar ne PAK ko die sabutaraksha mantri manohar parrikar ne bhi airforce base par hamale ke peeche pakistani haath hone ke bhi sanket die hai
 At the same time, the Indian government has also handed over the evidence of the connection of the attack to Pakistan
 jeb jab dhili hoti he to achche-acchon ko line pe le aati he
 Otherwise, think the same roads, the same vehicles, the same red light, the same helmet, the same set belt, the same traffic rules
 par zaraa sa noton kaa rang or sies kya badla sab kuch badal gaya
 The fear fell on the streets
 log apni-apni gadiyon ke aarasi, license, insurance or polution certificate dhundne lage
 He smiled waiting for the red light to be green
 magar haa, kai jagahon par dard-e-chaalaan aisa chhalkaa ki uski har jhalak jhalkiyaan ban gayi
 For the past few days, suddenly there has been a strange sadness on the streets of India
 sadakon kii romaaniat kahin kho si gai he
 Neither the sound of horns of vehicles are making a noise in the ears
 naa bikon kii wo khubasurat bal khaati lahariya chaal ankhon ko thandak de paa rahi hai
 Where are the fucking slaves fluttering in the air while holding the helmet
 dupahiyaa se to jaise ham do hamaare do ke naare hi chin liye gaye hon
 Three or four friends and family sitting together are now moving in parts and installments
 raftaar to jaise ab saal main do-chaar baar hone vaale formula van res jaisi ho gai he
 So far, the fate of the seat belt that spoils the crease of the shirt or comes over the stomach has also suddenly woken up
 or to or ab to nashe main bhi tu jaanata nahin main koun hum ki bajaae gaadi main pade puure or adhure kagajaat hi bas yaad rahete hai
 The problem of panic and horror is that in many places people are even making bikes and scooters as bicycles according to their respective circumstances
 idhar, chaalaan kii raseed thame police vaale dikhaai die, udhar jhat se dupahiyaa se utar gaye or paidal hi aage badhane lage
 Now what should the police also do bina helmet bike yaa scooter chalaane par to chaalaan he
 But there is no invoice for walking with a bike or scooter
 to kul mila kar das din pehle tak gulzaar rahane vaali sadak par ab haalat acchhee nahin he
 Thinking ten or ten times, people are taking off their vehicles, scooters or bikes on the roads
 dur kii nazar pehle se hi duuri par gaad dete hai
 i do not know from which crossroads, nook or road side, they suddenly come from Chham
 unke aane se dar lagata he
 Because their arrival means going for a full month's budget
 haathon main chaalaan kii raseed thame wo ab aise dikhte hai, maano sarhad paar ke dushman hon
 As soon as their hands are up, the challan will be deducted
 yaad nahin desh ke kisi polution centre par pehle kabhi gadiyon kii aisi qatari lagi ho
 Initially, when CNG came, there was probably such a rush at the petrol pump
 par jaise hi logon ko pataa chalaa ki bhayya driving license, aarasi or insurance ke alaava pradooshan certificate naa hone par bhi das hajaar tak kaa chaalaan he, har gaadi ne apana rukh idhar hi mode diya
 Well, what if people do? bees-tees-chalis-pachaas-saath hazaar tak ke chaalaan ke bare main das din pehle tak kisi ne suna hi nahin tha
 Then he also has a second hand
 ab isi ke maare jin logon ne second hand gaadi 15-25 pachaas hajaar main kharidi ho or usase zyada rakam kaa chaalaan cat jaae to chaalaan bharne se acha yahi samajhate hai ki gaadi main hi aag laga do
 Where it is foolish to give more challan than that of no car
 dilli main ek noujvaan ne thik yahi kiya tha
 He set his bike on fire by himself
 trephic jam ho gaya
 Had to call fire engine koi helmet se haara he
 So someone is killed by incomplete papers
 kisi kii zindagi red lite ne laal kar di to kisi ke nashile chaalaan ne puure maheene kaa hang over utaar daalaa
 By the way, the changing and sad roads, suddenly some people have lost immense happiness
 achaanak sadakon par safed vardidhari manushyon kii taadaad badi-badi nazar aa rahi he
 Despite the heat and humidity, there is a strange bright glow on their faces
 dabi jubaan main to log yahaan tak kehane lage hai ki nayaa motor kanoon inke liye ek tarah se aathvaan vetanman lekar aayaa he
 The Shiv Sena on Sunday demanded the government to declare separatists 'waving the flag of Pakistan and raising pro-pakistan slogans' a heinous crime equivalent to murder

 'kohli said,' We appeal to mps to enact stringent laws to deal with such anti-national activities
 ise hatya ke baraabar ek jaghanya aparaadh ke taur par dekha janaa chahie or is tarah ke kaamon ke liye maut kii sajaa milani chahie
 'people in Kashmir will continue to unfurl the flag of Pakistan: Gilani, the second-placed Hurriyat Conference, said that people will continue to hoist Pakistani flags at his rallies in Kashmir
 gilaani ne apane awaas par ek samaaroh main kaha, 'pakistani jhande fahraae gaye hai (kashmir main) or inshollah bhavishya main bhi fahraae jaaenge, kyonki pakistan hamaara padosi or shubhachintak he
 'pakistan's flag was hoisted at various separatist rallies in Kashmir from April 15 this year, on which opposition parties strongly criticized the state government

 up's new Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has launched a new Twitter handle
 @myogiadityanath naam se unke is nae twitor handle ko shuru karne kii vajah kisi ko samaj nahin aa rahi
 People are wondering why Yogi had to start this new account when his Twitter account was already called @yogi_adityanath
 saavdhaan! yogi ji kaam par hai, achaanak thane pahunchakar bole- upi main hoga kanoon kaa rajbadalanaa chaahate hai chhavijankaar kehete hai ki upi kaa siem banane ke baad unhen apni chhavi badalane kii naseehat mil rahi he
 This may be the first step taken in that direction
 gauratlab he ki uttar pradesh kaa siem banane se pehle yogi kaa purana twitor acount tha
 Twitter users claim that Yogi had made many such tweets on this account, which were disputed
 chunki inhen chun-chunakar delit karnaa mushkil bharaa kaam tha isliye ye nayaa acount shuru kiya gaya he
 Yogi's old account can no longer be accessed
 website par abhi bhi puraani chhavi haalanki siem yogi kii website kuch or hi bayaan kar rahi he
 Take a look at the image of Yogi and his articles in it - everyone's development with everyone - CM is in action mode and he is doing something which is in the headlines everyday, so now he felt the need for a new Twitter account
 
 darasal, unki kattar hindutv vaali chhavi ko todane ke liye yah karnaa aavashyak tha
 But it seems that soon they will feel the need for a lot of changes in their website
