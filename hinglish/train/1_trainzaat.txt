 At the behest of Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi, campaign is going on against BJP President Nitin Gadkari from within the party
 yah aarope aresas ke varisht netaa emji vaidya ne apane blog main lagaaya he
 According to Vaidya, Modi wants to become Prime Minister and he feels that Gadkari will not let him fulfill this desire
 vaidya ne likhaa he ki adwani or gadakari pradhanmantri hone ke liye manaa kar chuke hai jabaki modi ne yah baat nahin kahi he
 Vaidya also says that if Ram Jethmalani has any complaints, he should keep them within the party and not make it public
 vaidya yaheen nahin rukate unka kahana he ki bijepi abhi apane pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar kaa elaan na kare
 At the same time, the Sangh has said on Vaidya's statement that this is his personal opinion and not the Sangh's
 emji vaidya ne jaswant singh yashavanth sinha or shatrughna sinha ko salaah di he ki agar unhen itani naaraazgi he to vah mahesh jethmalani kii tarah party se istipha de den
 Senior RSS leader MG Vaidya has come out openly in support of Nitin Gadkari and has taken on Narendra Modi
 vaidya ne apane blog main likhaa he ki nitin gadakari ke khilaaf modi campan chalaa rahe hai
 He argues that when Ram Jethmalani sought BJP President Nitin Gadkari's resignation, he also talked about making Narendra Modi the candidate for the post of Prime Minister
 vaidya kaa kahana he ki narendra modi ko lagata he ki gadakari unke or pradhanmantri pad ke bich roda ban sakate hai
 This is the reason why Modi wants to remove Gadkari from the post of party president and for this he is resorting to Ram Jethmalani
 blog main vaidya ne bijepi ke saansad ram jethmalani ke saarvajanik rup se gadakari ke khilaaf bayaanbaji karne par bhi naaraazgi jataai he
 According to him, if Jethmalani had any complaint with Gadkari, he could have spoken on the party platform
 iske liye baahar jaakar bayaanbazi karne kii kya zarurat he
 The comments bijepi adhyaksh nitin gadakari ne is masale par ek bayaan jari kiya he
 It says that my attention has been drawn to the Marathi blog of senior journalist MG Vaidya
 is blog kaa saar media ke ek varg main bhi prakashit kiya gaya he
 The author has recently tried to relate the remarks of a party MP to Narendra Modi
 bijepi aisi kisi bhi koshish ko puri tarah khaarij karti he, kyonki iskaa koi aadhaar nahin he
 All the central leaders and chief ministers of the party are working fully together for the party
 ham gujarat vidhansabha chunaav puure aapasi vishwaas or ekta ke saath lard rahe hai
 BJP stands firmly united with Narendra Modi and we are confident that BJP will get a grand victory in the coming assembly elections
 vaidya ke mutabik modi pradhanmantri bananaa chaahate hai or unhen lagata he ki gadakari unhen yah hasarat puri nahin karne denge
 Vaidya has written that Advani and Gadkari have refused to be the Prime Minister, whereas Modi has not said this
 vaidya kaa yah bhi kahana he ki agar ram jethmalani ko koi shikaayat he to vah unhen party ke bheetar rakhni chahie na ki saarvajanik kerani chahie
 Vaidya does not stop here, he says that the BJP should not announce its prime ministerial candidate right now
 vahiin sangh ne vaidya ke is bayaan par kaha he ki yah unki nijee raay he sangh kii nahin
 MG Vaidya has advised Jaswant Singh Yashwant Sinha and Shatrughan Sinha to resign from the party like Mahesh Jethmalani if he is so angry
 aresas ke varisht netaa emji vaidya nitin gadakari ke samarthan main khulkar saamne aa gaye hai or narendra modi ko aade haathon liya he
 Vaidya has written in his blog that Modi is running a campaign against Nitin Gadkari
 unka tark he ki jab ram jethmalani ne bijepi adhyaksh nitin gadakari kaa istipha maanga tha tab unhone narendra modi ko pradhanmantri pad ke liye ummidavaar banane kii bhi baat kahi thi
 Vaidya says that Narendra Modi feels that Gadkari can be a barrier between him and the Prime Minister
 yahi vajah he ki modi gadakari ko party ke adhyaksh pad se hataanaa chaahate hai or iske liye ram jethmalani kaa sahaara le rahe hai
 In the blog, Vaidya has also expressed displeasure over BJP MP Ram Jethmalani publicly making statements against Gadkari
 unke mutabik, agar jethmalani ko gadakari se koi shikaayat he to vah party ke manch par apni baat rakh sakate the
 What is the need to go out and make a statement for this? tippaniyan BJP President Nitin Gadkari has issued a statement on this issue
 isamen kaha gaya he ki meraa dhyaan varisht patrkaar emji vaidya ke marathi blog kii ore dilaayaa gaya he
 The essence of this blog has also been published in a section of the media
 lekhak ne haal main party ke ek saansad kii tippaniyon ko narendra modi se jodne kii koshish kii he
 The BJP completely rejects any such attempt, as it has no basis
 party ke sabhi kendriya netaa or mukhyamantri party ke liye puri tarah milakar kaam kar rahe hai
 We are contesting the Gujarat assembly elections with mutual trust and unity
 bijepi puri tarah ek hokar majbootee se narendra modi ke saath khadi he or hamen vishwaas he ki aane vaale vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi ko shandaar jeet hasil hogi
 Vaidya also says that if Ram Jethmalani has any complaints, he should keep them within the party and not make it public
 vaidya yaheen nahin rukate unka kahana he ki bijepi abhi apane pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar kaa elaan na kare
 At the same time, the Sangh has said on Vaidya's statement that this is his personal opinion and not the Sangh's

 is baar bihar chunaav main prachaar ke tareeke kaaphi badale-badale najar aa rahe hai
 The BJP is startled by innovative experiments in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections itself, but Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has also walked the same path in the assembly elections
 unki aguai vaale saajhe morche ne hai-tech prachaar kii ranneeti banaai he
 If we consider, Nitish's promotion is similar to what Narendra Modi had done before the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 isaki vajah hai prashanth kishor
 It was Prashant Kishore who led the campaign for Narendra Modi in the Lok Sabha elections
 'chaay par charchaa' or '3di hologram' kaa idia unki team kii hi upaj tha
 But BJP did not use Prashant Kishor in Haryana and Maharashtra assembly elections
 vahi prashanth ab bihar main nitish ke prachaar kii kaman sambhaal rahe hai
 Let us see how there are similarities between Modi's campaign in 2014 and Nitish's election campaign in 2015: 1
 twitor par siyaasi chuunchumbihar kaa voter twitor se kitna prabhavit hoga, yah bahes kaa vishay hoga, lekin prashanth kishor ne yah daanv bhi khel diya he
 Nitish has come out actively on Twitter
 vah bihar ke pehle mukhyamantri hai, jinhone is micro-bloging website par sawaal-jawaab kaa satr bulaakar chunaav prachaar kiya
 In the past, people have asked him questions through the # asknitish hashtag on Twitter and the Chief Minister has answered
 isi dauraan hi vah 'bhujang controvarsi' hui
 In 2014, Twitter was an important tool for Narendra Modi's election campaign
 modi samarthakon kii team din bhar kaam karti thi taaki unke hashtag twitor ke top trend bane rahen
 Even after becoming Prime Minister, Modi considers Twitter to be a big force and is quite active there
 2
 The slogan was more or less the same as Modi's slogan 'abki Bar, Modi Sarkar' proved to be a super hit and is remembered as an example of excellent public relations
 prashanth kishor ne aisa hi aakarshak or jubaan par chadhane vaala naaraa nitish ke liye bhi banaaya he
 It is, 'be it once again, be out in Bihar, be it once again, be Nitishe Kumar
 ' 'neetishae' main aanchalikta kaa put bhi he
 The ringtone has also been released to make the song accessible to mobile phones
 iskaa istemaal nitish ke prachaar abhiyaan 'har ghar dastak' ke dauraan kiya ja rahaa he
 The pro-nitish slogans also show the same timeliness as the BJP has been using
 yah anayas nahin he ki modi kii mujffarpur raily ke thik baad naaraa aayaa, 'jhaanse main na aaenge, nitish ko jitaayenge
 '3
 nitish kaa 'parchaa par charchaa'door-tu-door campan koi nayaa tarika nahin he, lekin 2014 main bijepi or 2015 main aam aadmi party ne iskaa bade str par or kaamyaab istemaal kiya
 The slogan of 'ghar Ghar Modi, Har Har Modi' bounced from Varanasi and continued till Delhi
 is baar jediu kaaryakarta bhi haath main parche liye ghar-ghar ja rahe hai
 In 30 days, 10 lakh party workers have targeted to reach 3 crore people by knocking on 1 crore houses
 jediu kii ore se parchaa par charchaa bhi chalaai ja rahi he
 Its purpose is to discuss with the voters on the basis of the party's pamphlets so that a direct connection can be made with the semi-urban and rural voters
 chunaav prachaar kaa yah tarika bhi modi ke behad safal rahe chaay par charchaa se saaf taur par prerit lagata he
 Curiously, that method was also a brainchild of Prashant Kishore

 Call to join BJP ran a missed call campaign
 nitish kumaar ne bhi ek number jari kiya he
 The ad goes like this - 'call to join us
 9006290062'5
 After 10 years, Visionteesh Kumar is about to launch The Bihar @ 2025 campaign on Facebook and Twitter
 iske tahat beete 10 saal main sarkaar kii uplabdhiyon kaa bakhaan kiya jayega, sawaalon ke jawaab die jaaenge or sujhaavon ko aamantrit kiya jayega
 This way of reaching the public is reminiscent of the Modi style
 modi bhi apane bhaashanon main bharat ke 10 or 20 saal baad ke bhavishya par baat kiya karte the
 Nitish Kumar will also start having breakfast with his supporters and the media
 6
 With facts on the Modi government, Warmodi had made the issue of corruption and the declining economy and development dreams of the UPA era
 team nitish ne modi kii aalochana ko lekar bahut taarkik ranneeti taiyaar kii he
 He is talking on paper rather than air fire and disrespect
 modi sarkaar par unheen kii jubaan se nikle ab tak adhure vaadon kii babat hamalaa kiya ja rahaa he
 For example, the promise of return of black money and Rs 15-20 lakhs to everyone's account, Utern on MSP, no plan-resources on dream of giving home to everyone in 2022, promise of special state status for Bihar etc

 Movie Review Bioscopewala: Kahani Wahi, Packaging Nayi, Danny's tremendous guess: The film's story begins with Chambal's ravines, where a bride is shot at the hands of a domineering Shambhu (jackie Shroff) during a wedding
 iske baad use jail janaa padataa he
 Kadak Singh (KK Manon), a member of the same gang, then becomes Bahubali
 saath hi usee ilaake kaa mantri ram vijay treepathi (pankaj treepathi) he jo apni ashleel harkaton ke liye janaa jaataa he
 Once, Ram Vijay Tripathi's eyes are on the teacher Rosie (mahi Gill)
 jabardastee karne ke kaaran teacher kii mrityu ho jaati he, jisaki vajah se use jail bhi janaa padataa he
 The story features Radhey (jimmy Shergill), who owes a favor to Kadak Singh, and because of that favor, Kadak Singh pledges to take care of Radhey and his wife Lalli (shriya Saran), but when Ram Vijay Tripathi When he comes back from jail, many incidents happen and eventually a result comes, which you will have to watch the film to know
 Movie Review Parmanu: desh ke prati garv paidaa karti he film, umdaa adaakaarikamjor kadiyaan:film kii kahani kaaphi ghisi-piti si najar aati he or jis tarah se uskaa treetment he wo or bhi kamjor he
 Despite the presence of so many good actors, that is not the case in the film
 in sitaron ko cash kar paane main mekars asamarth rahe hai
 There is quite a lot of editing
 sinc sound bhi sanvaadon se kai jagah mail nahin khaataa he
 Rugged is mentioned, but the film has only a few selections of rugged shots, the rest is a completely different story
 film kaa screenple bhi kamjor he saath hi sangeet bhi prachlit nahin ho paaya he 
 Why watch the film: Pankaj Tripathi's work in the film is tremendous
 uske saath hi ke ke minan, jimi shergill, shriya saran , diparaj rana or special apiyarence main maahi gil ne bhi acha kaam kiya he
 The dialogues of the film also make you laugh at many places

 lokapal bhale na aayaa ho lekin iske aane ko lekar jo andolan hua usase nikal kar kai log satta main aa gaye
 In the year of 2011 to 13, it seemed that if the Lokpal does not come then the doom will come
 2013 main lokapal kanoon ban gaya
 First introduced in Lok Sabha in 1968
 kanoon banane main 45 saal lag gaye to kanoon banane ke baad lokapal niyukt hone main kam se kam das bees saal to lagane hi chahie the
 It has been only four years since the Lokpal Act was made, 41 years are still left, but people have forgotten so soon that if corruption will be overcome, it will be away from the Lokpal, but people have forgotten so much that they do not remember that the Lokpal movement Two parties have to vote in the Municipal Corporation of Delhi elections
 lokapal-lokapal gane vaale gitarist kii bahut yaad aa rahi he, unka gaanaa bahut acha tha
 The Bharatiya Janata Party wrote on page number 9 of the 2014 manifesto, 'administrative reforms will be a priority for the BJP, for this we propose to implement them through a proper body under the Prime Minister's Office, we will be an effective Lokpal institution We will constitute, every level of corruption will be dealt with swiftly and rigorously
 ' Have you seen the institution of effective Lokpal in these three years? bagair lokapal ke hi bhrashtachar dur karne kaa daawa kiya ja rahaa he, log bhrashtachar kii shikayaton ko lekar kabhi pradhanmantri ko patr likh rahe hai to hamen bhi copy kar dete hai
 If Lokpal was there, all the complaints of corruption would have gone there and action would have been taken
 bagair lokapal ke rozaana certificate jari hota he ki karpshan kaa koi aarope nahin laga he
 The government forgot the Lokpal so much that Common Cause had to file a petition in the Supreme Court to remind it
 27 april ko supreme court ne sarkaar kii har daleel ko kaarij kar diya
 The Supreme Court has clearly stated that the Central Government should complete the process of appointment of Lokpal without the Leader of the Opposition
 netaa vipaksh ke na hone kii vajah se lokapal kii niyukti roke rakhane kaa koi auchity nahin he
 The Lokpal Act can only be acted upon without modification
 centre sarkaar kii daleel thi ki kanoon main sanshodhan bina lokapal kii niyukti nahin ho sakati
 The debate was also held on March 28, in the court of the Attorney General of the Government of India, Mukul Rohatgi said that the appointment of Lokpal is not possible under the present circumstances
 ye vartmaan halaat kya hai
 The government's main argument has been that there is no Leader of the Opposition and close to twenty amendments are pending in Parliament
 pichley teen saal main ek se ek mushkil kanoon paas hue hai, jis kanoon ko sabhi raajnneetik dalon ne pehle paas nahin hone diya, phir milakar paas kiya taaki janata ko yah na lage ki koi bhrashtachar ke kilaaf nahin he to us kanoon main ek maamuli sa sanshodhan kyon nahin ho sakaa
 On 28 March, the government submitted its stand in the Supreme Court that the judiciary should respect the sharing of rights and Parliament should not issue instructions to appoint the Lokpal
 magar 27 april ko supreme court ne saaf saaf kah diya ki lokapal kii niyukti ke liye koi bahaanaa nahin chalegaa
 The Lokpal Bill was amended in 2014, but the Standing Committee took a year
 atorni general ne kaha ki sansadeey samiti ne bhrashtachar nirodhak sansthaaon ke liye ekikrut dhaanche kii sifarish kii he
 The report recommends the Central Vigilance Commission, cbi's Anti Corruption Bureau be integrated with the Lokpal
 kul milakar lokapal niyukt na karne ke jitne bhi tark sarkaar ke the, adaalat main nahin tik sake
 So has the day now come when Lokpal will be appointed
 yah sanstha apana kaam karegi or naagarik bhrashtachar kii shikaayatein ek swytt sanstha se kar sakenge
 a report was published in the Indian Express on 13 April
 kendriya sansthaaon main bhrashtachar par nigaraanee rakhane vaali sanstha kendriya satarkta ayog sivisi ne sansad main ek report saunpi
 According to this, there has been a jump of 67 percent in complaints of corruption against employees of various departments of the central government
 bhrashtachar kii sabase adhik shikaayatein rail mantralay ke karmchaariyon ke kilaaf ain hai
 There have been 11,000 complaints of corruption against railway employees
 grahamantralay ke karmchaariyon ke kilaaf 6,513 shikaayatein ain hai
 There have been 6,018 complaints against bank employees
 petroleum mantralay ke karmchaariyon ke kilaaf 2,496 shikaayatein ain hai
 There have been 689 complaints against the employees of the Ministry of Defense
 ye kendriya satarkta ayog kii report he
 While the government has been claimed to be corruption free
 agar lokapal hota to bhrashtachar ke daavon ke bare main swatantra rup se pushti ho sakati thi
 According to the report of the Central Vigilance Commission tabled in Parliament, complaints of corruption have skyrocketed within a year
 2015 main 29,838 shikaayatein darj hui thim
 In 2016, 49,847 complaints were filed
 ek saal main 67 fisadi kaa oochaal aayaa
 Not only this, the CVC has also received a large number of complaints against the officers and employees of various state governments and other organizations, there has been a jump of 50 percent
 in shikayaton kaa nipataara bhi kiya gaya he
 11,200 complaints were received against railway employees of which 8,852 were settled
 lekin chah maheene se karmchaariyon ke kilaaf 1,054 shikaayatein lambit hai
 According to this report, complaints of corruption have come down against the employees of National Capital Territory of Delhi
 2015 main 5,139 shikaayatein darj hui thim, 2016 main ghatakar 969 ho gai
 The comments 26 april ke hindustan times main chetan chouhan kii ek report he
 According to this, the government is going to bring a new change in the Right to Information Act
 dilli hai court main sunwaayee ke dauraan sarkaar ne halafanama diya he
 Accordingly, the appeal can be withdrawn
 jise soochna ke adhikaar kaaryakartaaon kaa kahana he ki isse jo visal blor he yani jo bhrashtachar ko ujagar karata he, uski jaan khatare main pad sakati he
 People will put pressure on exposing them and return the appeal
 yahi nahin, ek praavdhaan yah bhi bataaya ja rahaa tha ki aavedak kii maut ke baad aavedan nirast mana jayega
 The workers are demanding from the government that they should not do so
 ek aankade ke mutabik 2005 se ab tak artiai daayar karne vaale 65 logon kii hatya ho chuki he or 400 logon par hamale ho chuke hai
 The Hindustan Times report points out that the government's stand is that this amendment is not new but it is the same that UPA tried to bring in 2012
 koi nayaa badlaav prastaavit nahin he
 After coming to the government in 2014, Prime Minister Modi and other ministers have claimed that the SIT has been formed on the very first day to find out the black money under the order of the Supreme Court
 3 march ke hindu akhbaar main esaiti ke dipti chairman justise arijit pasaayat kaa ek bayaan chapa he ki ab tak 70,000 karod kaala dhan kaa pataa chalaa he jisamen 16,000 karod videshon main he
 There is no formal notice of how many thousand crores of black money has been detected by demonetisation, whether the SIT has found out that it has ended in demonetisation or not
 tab justise pasaayat ne bataaya ki esaiti ne sarkaar ko suzav diya tha ki teen lakh se zyada ke cash main lenden ko avaidh ghoshit kar diya jaae to sarkaar ne maan liya balki sarkaar ne ise ab do lakh kar diya he
 How many people know that this was a good suggestion of SIT
 baharhaal bhrashtachar dur karne kii sanstha lokapal hi nahin he baaki sab hai
 Everyone has their own claims
 kya aapane in teen varshon main prabhavi lokapal kii sanstha gathit hote hue dekhi he
 It is being claimed to remove corruption without the Lokpal, if people are writing a letter to the Prime Minister about the complaints of corruption, then they also copy us
 agar lokapal hota to bhrashtachar kii sari shikaayatein vahaan jaatin or un par karrwai hoti
 Without the Lokpal, a daily certificate is issued that there is no allegation of corruption
 lokapal ko sarkaar itnaa bhul gai ki yaad dilaane ke liye gaiyr sarkari sanstha kaaman coz ko supreme court main yachika daayar kerani padi
 On 27 April, the Supreme Court dismissed every plea of the government
 supreme court ne saafe kah diya he ki centre sarkaar bina netaa vipaksh ke hi lokapal kii niyukti kii prakriya puri kare
 There is no justification for holding the appointment of Lokpal due to lack of Leader Opposition
 lokapal act par bina sanshodhan ke hi kaam kiya ja saktaa he
 The central government argued that the Lokpal cannot be appointed without amending the law
 28 march ko bhi bahes hui thi, court main bharat sarkaar ke atorni general mukul rohtagi ne kaha tha ki vartmaan halaat main lokapal kii niyukti sambhav nahin he
 What are these current conditions? sarkaar kii mukhya daleel rahi he ki vipaksh kaa netaa nahin he or bees ke kareeb sanshodhan karne hai jo sansad main lambit he
 In the last three years, one difficult law has been passed, the law which was not allowed to be passed by all political parties, then passed together so that the public does not feel that there is no corruption, then that law has a slight Why the amendment could not take place
 28 march ko supreme court main sarkaar ne apana paksh rakhaa tha ki nyaaypalika ko adhikaron ke bantwaare kaa sammaan karnaa chahie or sansad ko ye nirdesh jari nahin karne chahie ki vah lokapal kii niyukti kare
 But on April 27, the Supreme Court clearly stated that no excuse will be allowed for the appointment of Lokpal
 lokapal bill main 2014 main sanshodhan prastaav laayaa gaya tha lekin standing cameti ne ek saal kaa vakt le liya
 The Attorney General said that the Parliamentary Committee recommended an integrated framework for anti-corruption institutions
 report main kendriya satarkta ayog, sibiai kii anti karpshan beuro ko lokapal ke saath ekikrut karne kii sifarish kii gai he
 Overall, all the arguments of the government not to appoint Lokpal, could not stand in court
 to kya ab wo din aa gaya he jab lokapal niyukt ho sakegaa
 This institution will do its job and citizens will be able to make complaints of corruption from an autonomous body
 13 april ke indian express main ek report chhapi thi

 hindustan times kii report main sarkaar kaa paksh yah bataaya gaya he ki yah sanshodhan nayaa nahin he balki upie ne 2012 main laane kaa prayaas kiya tha, vahi he
 No new changes are proposed
 2014 main sarkaar main aane ke baad pradhanmantri modi or anya mantriyon kaa daawa rahaa he ki pehle hi din supreme court ke aadesh ke tahat kaale dhan kaa pataa lagane ke liye esaiti kaa gathan kar diya gaya he
 a statement by SIT deputy chairman Justice Arijit Pasayat has appeared in the Hindu newspaper of 3 March that 70,000 crore black money has been detected so far, including 16,000 crore abroad
 notebandi se kitne hazaar karod kaala dhan kaa pataa chalaa he isaki aupchaarik soochna nahin ai he, esaiti kaa jo pataa chalaa he wo notebandi main samaapt ho gaya yaa nahin, isaki bhi aupchaarik soochna nahin he
 Then Justice Pasayat said that the SIT had suggested to the government that if the transactions in cash of more than three lakhs were declared illegal, the government agreed but instead the government has now reduced it to two lakhs
 kitne logon ko pataa he ki wo esaiti kaa nek suzav tha
 However, the institution of eliminating corruption is not just the Lokpal

 You will know about many different stories related to the religious text Mahabharata, but there are many stories about which you are hardly aware
 jaaniye dharmik granthamahabharatase sambandhit aisi hi 11 kahaniyon ke bare main:1
 When the Kaurava army was losing the war to the Pandavas, Duryodhana went to Bhishma Pitamah and told him that you are not fighting this war with all your power
 bhishma pitamah ko kaaphi gussa aayaa or unhone turant paanch sone ke tir liye or kuch mantra padhe
 After reciting the mantra, he told Duryodhana that tomorrow with these five arrows he will kill the Pandavas
 magar duryodhana ko bhishma pitamah ke upar vishwaas nahin hua or usne tir le liye or kaha ki vah kal subah in tiron ko waapas karegaa
 The story behind these arrows is also very funny
 bhagwaan krishna ko jab tiron ke bare main pataa chalaa to unhone arjuna ko bulaayaa or kaha ki tum duryodhana ke paas jaao or pancho tir maang lo
 You once saved Duryodhana's life from Gandharva
 iske badale usne kaha tha ki koi ek cheez jaan bachaane ke liye maang lo
 The time has come for you to ask for those five gold arrows
 arjuna duryodhana ke paas gaya or usne tir maange
 Being a Kshatriya, Duryodhana fulfilled his promise and gave arrows to Arjuna
 2
 Dronacharya can be considered India's first test tube baby
 yah kahani bhi kaaphi rochak he
 Dronacharya's father was Maharishi Bhardwaj and his mother was an Apsara
 darasal, ek shaam bharadwaj shaam main ganga nahaane gaye tabhi unhen vahaan ek apsara nahaati hui dikhaai di
 Seeing her beauty, the sage was enchanted and sperm came out of his body, which the sage stored in an earthen pot and kept it in the dark
 isi se dronacharya kaa janm hua
 3
 jab pandavon ke pita pandu marane ke kareeb the to unhone apane putron se kaha ki budhimaan banane or gyaan hasil karne ke liye ve unka mastishk kha jaaen
 Only Sahadeva fulfilled his wish and ate his brain
 pehali baar khaane par use duniya main ho chuki chizon ke bare main jaankaree mili
 On eating for the second time, he learned about the things happening in the present and on the third time he got information about what is going to happen in the future
 4
 Abhimanyu's wife Vatsala was the daughter of Balarama
 balram chaahate the ki vatsala kii shaadi duryodhana ke bete lakshmana se ho
 Vatsala and Abhimanyu loved each other
 abhimanyune vatsala ko paane ke liye ghatotkach kii madad lee
 Ghatotkacha frightened Lakshmana so much that he swore that he would not marry all his life
 5
 Arjun's son Iravan sacrificed himself for his father's victory
 bali dene se pehle uski antami ichha thi ki vah marane se pehle shaadi kar le
 But no girl was ready for this marriage because her husband was to die soon after marriage
 is sthiti main bhagwaan krishna ne mohini kaa rup liya or iravan se na keval shaadi kii balki ek patni kii tarah use vidaa karte hue roe bhi
 6
 sahadev, jo apane pita kaa mastishk khaakar budhimaan bana tha
 He had the ability to see the future, so Duryodhana went to him and asked him about the right Muhurta before starting the war
 sahadev yah jaanata tha ki duryodhana uskaa sabase bada shatru he phir bhi usne yuddh shuru karne kaa sahi samay bataaya
 7
 dhritarashtra kaa ek betaa yuyatsu naam kaa bhi tha
 Yuetsu was the son of a Vaishya woman
 darasal, dhritarashtra ke sambandh ek daasi ke saath the jisase yuyatsu paidaa hua tha
 8
 mahabharat ke yuddh main udupi ke raja ne nirpeksh rahane kaa faisla kiya tha
 The king of Udupi was neither from the Pandavas nor from the Kauravas
 udupi ke raja ne krishna se kaha tha ki kauravon or pandavon kii itani badi sena ko bhojan kii jarurat hogi or ham donon taraf kii senaaon ko bhojan banaakar khilaaengen
 In this war lasting 18 days, there was never any shortage of food
 sena ne jab raja se is bare main poocha to unhone iskaa shrey krishna ko diya
 The king said that when Krishna eats food, he comes to know from his diet that how many people are going to die tomorrow and food is cooked accordingly
 9
 While Duryodhana was taking his last breath in the battlefield of Kurukshetra, he had raised his three fingers
 bhagwaan krishna uske paas gaye or samaj gaye ki duryodhana kahana chahta he ki agar vah teen galtiyaan yuddh main naa karata to yuddh jeet letaa
 But Krishna told Duryodhana that even if you had done anything, you would have lost
 aisa sunne ke baad duryodhana ne apni ungali neeche kar lee
 10
 karn or duryodhana kii dosti ke kisse to kaaphi mashhoor hai
 Both Karna and Duryodhana's wife were playing chess once
 is khel main karn jeet rahaa tha tabhi bhaanumati ne duryodhana ko aate dekha or khadey hone kii koshish kii
 Karna was not aware of Duryodhana's arrival
 isliye jaise hi bhaanumati ne uthne kii koshish kii karn ne use pakadana chaha
 Instead of Bhanumati, the beads of her beads came into her hands and she broke
 duryodhana tab tak kamare main aa chukaa tha
 On seeing Duryodhana, both Bhanumati and Karna were afraid that Duryodhana might suspect something wrong
 magar duryodhana ko karn par kaaphi vishwaas tha
 He just said pick up the beads
 11
 Karna was quite famous for donating
 karn jab yuddh kshetra main aakhri saans le rahaa tha to bhagwaan krishna ne uski daansheeltaa kii pariksha leni chaahi
 He became a poor Brahmin and went to Karna and said that i have heard enough about you and i want some gift from you right now
 karn ne uttar main kaha ki aap jo bhi chahen maang len
 The Brahmin asked for gold
 karn ne kaha ki sona to uske daant main he or aap ise le sakate hai
 The Brahmin replied that i am not so cowardly as to break your teeth
 karn ne tab ek pathar uthaaya or apane daant tod liye
 The Brahmin refused to take it too, saying that he could not take this gold stained with blood
 karn ne iske baad ek baan uthaaya or aasmaan kii taraf chalaaya
 After this, it started raining and teeth were washed

 Lovely has been elected from Gandhi Nagar seat so far, but this time he will see the work related to elections
 lavali ne bhi party ke nirnay se sahmati jataate hue kaha ki yah party kaa nirnay he or main is faisle kaa sammaan karata hum
 Senior party leader and in-charge of party affairs in Delhi, PC Chacko said, the party has urged Gandhinagar constituency candidate Arvinder Singh Lovely to withdraw from the election and look at the work related to the election
 unhone kaha ki yah seat lavali kaa garh rahi he or is baar yahaan koun ummidavaar hoga, isaki ghoshnaa somvaar ko hogi
 Lovely's candidature was announced in the first list of Congress released for the assembly elections to be held in Delhi on February 7

 Whether it should be the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme or the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, it is a matter of debate and discussion
 donon paristhiti main skim ke centre bindu hone chahie- dirghakaalik sampatti or aajeevika kaa nirmaan
 Keeping this important issue in mind, i want to draw your attention to the following points, which need urgent attention
 1
 The employment generated through departmental work should be counted in NREGA, on the basis that only the most needy and poor people look for hard manual labor
 shahari va gramin ilaakon main aise kaaryon kii ginati honi chahie 'prachhann maang kii purti ke liye muhaiyaa karaae gaye rojgaar' ke tahat
 This will also increase departmental capacity in terms of the number of works to be implemented in the year
 2
 Provision for expenditure on work efficiency and upgradation should also be in NREGA
 is tarah naregaa ko rashtriya gramin aajeevika mishan ke saath joda ja saktaa he or donon scimen ek-duusare se labhanvit ho sakati hai
 3
 shram or saamagree ke 60:40 anupaat ko jile str par mana janaa chahie
 By this, different tasks can be started in different areas as per the requirement
 4
 The State Employment Guarantee Council should have complete freedom to include any work according to local needs in this scheme
 aashaa he ki upar die mere sujhaavon ko sakaaratmak rup se liya jayega or skim ko ek nayaa praaroop dene kaa sudhaarak kaary jald se jald prarambh kiya jayega

 After Digvijay Singh's wrong photo on Twitter, BJP is now accused of putting wrong advertisement of the streets of the state in its advertisement
 congress kaa aarope he ki bijepi ne 'samruddhi sadakon kii' ke naam se die gaye vigyaapan main jis sadak kaa photo diya he, wo madhya pradesh kii he hi nahin
 bjp's advertisement given in the newspapers of Madhya Pradesh under the name of 'samruddhi roads Ki' has now come into controversy
 congress ne aarope lagaaya he ki is vigyaapan main siem shivaraj singh chouhan or piem modi ke photo ke saath becoground main jis tarah kaa express-ve banane kaa daawa kiya gaya he, wo tasviir empi kii nahin balki videsh kii he
 In the picture given in the advertisement, the vehicles are running on the left hand drive while in India there is a right hand drive
 congress kaa aarope he ki vigyaapan main jo photo istemaal kii gai he, wo videshi haive yaa phir express-ve kii he
 The Congress has accused BJP of misleading propaganda by making it an issue
 is vigyaapan main istemaal kiye gaye photo ko lekar congress ne chunaav ayog main jaakar shikaayat kii he
 Madhya Pradesh Congress Media Convenor Narendra Saluja told that by looking at the road photo given in the newspaper, it seems that it is not from India or Madhya Pradesh
 isamen ulti disha main gaadiyaan chal rahi hai
 Saluja alleged that this is a photo of a foreign road because the vehicles whose photo is in it are also foreigners and the BJP is misleading the public through misleading propaganda
 bijepi ke is vigyaapan main agali sarkaar main sadak nirmaan ko lekar paanch saal kaa rodmap jari kiya he
 At the same time, BJP does not see anything wrong in this advertisement
 bijepi ke bhopal se saansad alok sanger kaa kahana he ki congress ne agar chunaav ayog se shikaayat kii he, to doodh kaa doodh or pani kaa pani ho jayega
 Sanjar said, 'whatever good we are showing, the Congress feels that it is from abroad
 congress ne to pakistan ke pul ko bharat kaa bataa diya tha, bangladesh kii sadak ko empi kaa bataa diya tha
 The Congress first peeped into its giriban, then made similar allegations against the BJP
 ' Leader of the Opposition in Rajya Sabha Arun Jaitley, while naming Narendra Modi, warned that any controversy over his claim for the post of Prime Minister in the party would prove to be a 'hit wicket' and if the BJP loses in the next Lok Sabha elections then its only possible This will be the reason
 unhone ishaara kiya ki gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi ko bijepi kaa pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar ghoshit kar diya janaa chahie
 Referring to the challenges facing the UPA government, he said, 'leadership is also an issue in the problems faced by this government
 upie main koi prabhaavshaalee netritv nahin he
 Due to this, people have turned to BJP
 ’ yahaan party mukhyalay main bijepi ke vidhi prakoshth ke sammelan kaa udghaatan karte hue unhone jor dekar kaha ki bijepi jitani jaldi apane netaa (pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar) ke naam kii ghoshnaa karegi, utana hi party ke liye behatar hoga
 Raising the argument in this context, Jaitley said, 'parliamentary elections are sometimes like presidential elections, especially when the leader is very popular
 atal bihari vaajapeyi, indira gandhi or jawaharlal nehru ke maamle main aisa hua he
 He said, if the next general election becomes a referendum (referendum) on the subject of leadership then BJP will definitely win
 is pariprekshya main unhone aagaah kiya ki netritv ke vishay par kisi bhi tarah kaa vivaad chunaavon main bijepi ko nuksaan pahunchaa saktaa he
 Jaitley said, 'we should not be a hit wicket
 is samay jo maahaul he, usamen koi aapako apni gend se out nahin kar saktaa balki aap khud hi apana wicket gira sakate hai
 Only in this situation can we lose the election
 ’ unhone kaha ki bijepi lagaataar do loksabhaa chunaav haar chuki he lekin aaj maahaul bijepi ke paksh main ban rahaa he
 Jaitley has often insisted that the BJP should declare Modi as the prime ministerial candidate
 haalanki bataaya jaataa he ki party ke kuch netaa is vichaar ke purajor virdohi hai
 Such leaders say that Modi's face is polarized and the Prime Minister's name should be decided after the election
 ucch sadan main netaa pratipaksh ne kaha ki upie sarkaar ke khilaaf vyapak satta-virdohi lahar he or ‘satta-virdohi lahar ek aisi cheez he jisamen vipaksh jeetta he kyonki janata sarkaar ko nakaar detii he
 Referring to differences within the party, Jaitley said, "our problem is that there are too many spokespersons
" ek vyakti tivi channelon kii bahason main ja rahaa he or khud ko bijepi kii yuva ikai se judaa hone kaa daawa karata he
 We have not been able to trace this spokesperson
 ’jetali us kathith netaa kaa zikr kar rahe the jisane yuva morcha kaa sadsy hone kaa daawa karke samachar channelon kii charchaa main hissaa liya or yon utpeedan ke aaropon kaa saamana kar rahe asaram kaa bachaav kiya

 Pakistan Army Chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa has been given service extension for another three years
 media reporto main kaha ja rahaa he ki kshetra ke maujuuda suraksha halaat ke maddenjar yah kadam uthaaya gaya he
 One reason has also been given that Prime Minister Imran Khan and Bajwa are working with close cooperation and in view of that it has been decided to extend his term

 The synergy between the two is also being seen quite a lot
 ullekhneey he ki bajva, khan kii pehali america yatra ke samay unke saath gaye the jahaan pradhanmantri ne white house main america raashtrapati donald trump se mulaakaat kii thi
 Khan had also nominated Bajwa as a member of the National Development Council in an unprecedented step
 pakistan main sena pramukh ke pad par niyukti pradhanmantri or unki sarkaar kaa visheshadhikaar hoti he
 Here the tradition of making the most senior military officer as army chief is not followed
 bajva ko aise samay main seva vistaar diya gaya he jab jammu kashmir se anuchhed 370 ko hataae jane ke faisle ke kaaran bharat or pakistan ke bich sambandh kharaab daur se guzar rahe hai
 Reacting to India's decision to abolish special status of Kashmir, Pakistan had decided to reduce the status of its diplomatic relations with New Delhi and expelled the Indian High Commissioner
 iske saath hi pakistan ne bharat ke saath apane kaarobaari rishton par bhi viraam laga diya
 On the other hand, India has clearly stated to the international fraternity that its decision to remove Article 370 granting special status to Jammu and Kashmir is completely its internal matter
 bharat ne pakistan ko bhi salaah di he ki vah sachaai ko sweekaar kare

 a day after the BJP promised sympathetic consideration to the demand of Gorkha people, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee today said that she will not allow the state to be divided and she is ready to die for it

 Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav, once a partner in the power of Bihar, is once again stained with corruption
 is baar lalu ke parivaar par bhi jaanch kii aanch padati dikh rahi he
 On Friday, CBI and Saturday ED raided the properties of Yadav family
 iske baad bijepi ne lalu par hamalaa tej karte hue nitish se lalu ke beton ke mantrimandal se hataane kii maang tej kar di
 However, if you look at political mathematics, it is not easy for Nitish to break his ties with RJD right now
 argedy supremeoke parivaar par lage bhrashtachar ke aaropon ke bich is baat kii bhi sugabugahat tej ho gai he ki nitish kumaar lalu yadav se gathbandhan tod lenge
 However, considering these few reasons, there is no possibility of separation of nitish-lalu
 1
 Bihar's hold on power, look at Bihar's power equation, RJD is the largest party with 80 seats in the 224-member assembly
 vahiin jediu ke paas 71 siten, to bijepi ke khate main 58 siten hai
 In such a situation, if the Congress gets 27 seats, 178 seats of the ruling Grand Alliance of Bihar are formed
 yahaan siton ke maamle main duusare number par rahane ke baavjoodnitish kumarabihar ke siem bane
 In such a situation, if Nitish joins hands with BJP, if RJD breaks ties, he will remain in power by crossing majority mark with 129 seats (71 + 58)
 aaropon main ghirne ke baad bihar kii satta par nitish kii pakad majboot ho gai he
 In such a situation, Nitish should hardly break the alliance with Lalu and go to BJP
 2
 By 2019, the Weight and Watchtower has announced that they are not contenders for the post of PM in 2019 and the Congress should clear its strategy for 2019
 haalanki, unke samarthak unhen vipaksh kaa sabase vishwasaneey cheharaa maanate hai
 The thing to note here is that while Nitish is still an important face of the opposition alliance and many people see him as the face of the PM post, his status will become quite dwarf in front of Prime Minister Narendra Modi on joining the BJP
 vipaksh ke chehre ke taur par bhi nitish 2019 main modi ke saamne zyada sambhaavnaaen nahin dekhte
 Therefore, Nitish's decision to withdraw from the 2019 race will be called a good decision
 3
 Difficult equation with BJP under modi-shah Raj: The way Nitish broke away from the NDA opposing Modi's face before the 2014 elections, it does not seem easy for him to join the same alliance again
 vipaksh main congress bhi kamjor hui he or rahul gandhi ko aage karne ke baad nitish ke liye vipaksh main kaaphi sambhaavnaaen banati hai
 Nitish will wait for this now

 With Nitish Kumar eyeing a big role in the centralization of the vote in Bihar, Bihar will have to do well in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections
 aise main nitish ke liye vot sameekaran ko bhi sadhana hoga
 During the assembly elections Lalu Yadav was strongly voted by Yadavs and Muslims because of him
 bihar main jahaan 16
 8% are Muslim voters, while Yadav voters constitute close to 14%
 lalu yadav ne isi muslim-yadav samikaran ke bal par bihar kii satta par 15 varshon tak raaj kiya
 In such a situation, Nitish also knows that joining hands with BJP will mean washing hands with this vote
 chinmayanand kharaab swasthya kii vajah se kegmyu main bhartee20 dinon se esaiti chinmayanand se jude maamle main jaanch kar rahi hepurv grih rajyamantri swami chinmayanand ke maamle main special investigeshan team yani esaiti somvaar ko apni states report elahabaad hai court ke saamne pesh karegi

 However, the SIT has not yet made this arrest
 is bich exiaar main naam aane ke baad peedit ladki ke parivaar vaale bhi kanoonee madad ke liye lagaataar daud bhaag kar rahe hai or bahut mumkin he ki aaj elahabaad hai court ke saamne agrim jamaanat ke liye yachika di jaae
 Meanwhile, the SIT will submit a status report on Monday about its investigation
 uske bare main court ke rukh ko dekhte hue aage kii karrwai kii jaaegi
 The court will decide whether it is satisfied with the investigation so far
 or aage ke liye nirdesh bhi degi
 The SIT has used all kinds of evidence and methods of investigation in its investigations
 states report darj karne se pehle esaiti ne sabhi aropiyon or peedita ke mobile phone kii forensik detail, kol detail record or sabhi ke wois sample record bhi ikattha kiye hai
 The CDR has revealed that Swami Chinmayananda, the victim girl and Sanjay Singh have had several long talks
 kol detail se yah bhi pataa chalata he ki peedita ne aaropee sanjay se saikadon baar baat kii he
 Also, the evidence collected by the SIT confirms the allegations against Swami Chinmayananda
 is maamle main giraftaar sanjay singh, sachin or vikram kii ek video footage bhi esaiti adaalat ko saunp degi
 The SIT will also submit a viral video of Swami Chinmayananda to the court
 kul milakar esaiti ne har taraf se lagbhag apni jaanch puri kar lee he
 And now he is waiting for the court's stand
 uske hisaab se hi aage kii karrwai kii jaaegi
 On the other hand, due to ill health, Chinmayananda has been admitted to Lucknow's KGMU
 jahaan uskaa upachaar chal rahaa he
 The accused has been kept in the cardiology department

 It was a coincidence that the terrorists who were firing guns on the bus of Hindu devotees with guns in their hands, was not anyone else but a Muslim who was driving the bus
 naam he saleem shaikh
 During this terrorist attack, he did the work which was the duty of any human being
 usne khud apni zindagi kii parvaah nahin kii or goliyon kii bauchhaar ke bich puri dilari or jambaaji ke saath apni bas chalaata rahaa
 Moreover, during the attack, once again the tire of the bus was punctured
 lekin saleem shaikh ne bas nahin roki or kareeb dedh kilometre tak tab tak apni bas daudata rahaa, jab tak wo aatankwaadiyon kii pahunch se baahar nahin nikal gai
 After this, Salim telephoned in his home and informed him about his well being, and also said that he should not run television at all, which would cause tension to other people in the house and especially the sick people
 patni ne bataaya ki wo bas sir jhukaakar bas chalaate rahe or unhone bas ko aatankiyon kii pahunch se dur kar diya
 Salim, the driver of a bus in Valsad, Gujarat, away from Jammu and Kashmir, was attacked in the house
 ek taraf to unhen is baat sukun or garv he ki unka apana saleem is hamale main naa sirf salaamat batch gaya, balki usne apni bas bhaga kar dusron kii jindagi bachaane kii bhi koshish kii
 But for those who died in this attack, there is an untold yearning in the heart of this family as well

 sachmuch agar hamale ke vakt saleem ne apni bahaduree nahin dikhaai hoti, to shaayad aatankwaadiyon kii is karatuut kaa anjaam kahin or bhayanak hota
 Salim said that God gave me the strength that i should not stop and keep running the bus
 lagaataar firing hui isliye main rukaa nahin, bas chalaata rahaa

 20,000 rupee se kam ke price segment main ek acha tivi kharidne kaa vichaar kar rahe hai to is renz main kai vikalp hai
 But the right screen size, resolution and features were not under your control earlier
 lekin ab nae brands ke aane se kai chijen badali hai or ab kam bajet main bhi bade screen vaale tivi market main uplabdh hai
 The limit of Rs 1,000 per inch was also broken, now customers can expect more things under Rs 20,000
 hamane 20,000 rupee se kam main aane vaale best tivi kii ek list taiyaar kii he
 Different sizes and brands of televisions have been included in this list, as well as some popular online options
 jaane ki neeche di gai list main se koun sa tivi aapke liye best vikalp he
 After the smartphone segment, Xiaomi stepped into the TV segment last year
 shaomi kaa pehla product 55-inch kaa 4K Mi TV 4 tha, lekin iske baad Xiaomi ne kai kifayati tivi market main launch kiye
 There are now a total of seven tvs of the Xiaomi brand available in India of which the 32-inch Mi TV 4C Pro is the most affordable option
 bharat main is tivi kaa daam 12,999 rupee he
 The 32-inch Xiaomi Mi TV 4C Pro has an HD resolution (1366x768 pixels) LED panel that comes with a 60 Hz refresh rate, along with two 10 watt speakers with DTS HD tuning
 yah ek smart tivi he, remote main microphone he or yah Google wais search feechar se las he
 Mi TV 4A (32) is undoubtedly cheaper than this but we recommend this TV as it comes with new voice enabled remote and better sound
 lekin Mi TV 4C Pro (32-inch) model kii keemat lagbhag Mi TV 4A Pro (32) ke samaan he
 This TV is our first choice because at this price it is equipped with many features
 is smart tivi main acha panel he, itnaa hi nahin isaki keemat bhi anya non-smart tivi kii tulana main kam he
 With this TV equipped with Patchwall OS, users will be able to stream content easily
 iske atirikt isamen Google sarvice bilt-in hai jaise ki video or audio kii casting ke liye kromcast, youtube or Google Play
 With the help of Google Play, you can download additional apps and other services for your TV
 online content dekhne ke icchhuk yuzars ke liye Xiaomi Mi TV 4C Pro sabase kifayati vikalp he
 TV has many features, so customers may not even need to buy a streaming device separately
 jab spacification kii baat aati he to bharat main tisiel range sambhawatah sabase romaanchak he
 The TCL 40S62FS TV is equipped with good specifications
 20,000 rupee se kam keemat main yah tivi 40 inch kaa phul-echdi rizolution disple panel ke saath aata he jo graahakon ko bade disple ke saath smart connactivity, sterio spikar, dolbi audio or screen miraring jaisi suvidhaon detaa he
 Netflix and youtube are already built-in to this TV so that users can easily watch online content
 TCL ke paas android interphes vaale tivi bhi hai lekin inaki keemat thodi zyada he
 The company's TCL 40S6500 is a bit expensive but it is an Android TV but the TCL launcher has been given in this particular model
 haalanki is keemat main jo gaur karne vaali baat he vah he iskaa panel rizolution or sies
 The panel is sharp and the motion is not smooth at times
 yadi aap online strimming, cabel yaa dit sabase adhik dekhte hai to TCL 40S62FS is keemat main aapke liye ek acha vikalp sabit ho saktaa he
 The two televisions we mentioned above are good TV by price and can only be bought online
 lekin agar aap tivi kharidne se pehle paas ke tivi showrooms main jaakar use dekhnaa chaahate hai to hamaare paas aapke liye ek vikalp he
 Samsung UA32N4000 is one of the most affordable options of Samsung and the price of this TV in India is Rs 19,800
 Samsung brands ke is tivi main 32 inch kaa echdi (1366x768 picksal) disple panel diya gaya he
 Talking about the tv's connectivity options, it has two HDMI ports, a USB port with a built-in media player that supports the main audio and video formats
 iske alaava yah tivi indian cinema mod ke saath aata he
 It is a good option for under Rs 20,000
 saath hi aap tivi kharidne se pehle tivi retailor ke paas jaakar ise dekh bhi sakate hai
 However, all these tvs have not gone through our in-depth review process
 hamane apni is list ko kam rakhane ke liye keemat or spacification ke aadhaar par inhen experions kiya he
 We have prepared this list of TV coming in the budget segment keeping in mind many things like specification, feature, size etc
 haalanki is keemat ke aasapaas kam se kam ek 4K tivi uplabdh he lekin iske saath hamaara anubhav bahut acha nahin tha
 This means that at this price you will get only 32 inch tvs which will be equipped with features
 is price segment main elidi-alsidi tivi hi uplabdh hai
 We have been able to shorten this list by listing online prices and on the official website of the companies
 hamaari is list main wo tivi shaamil hai jo onine aasaani se mil jate hai, lekin saath hi hamane un tivi ko bhi apni is list main shaamil kiya he jo retail store par bhi mil sakate hai
 Is it smart to buy a smart TV at this price smart connactivity feechar ke judane se kisi bhi tivi kii keemat bad jaati he
 On the other hand, if you want, you can buy a non-smart TV which will be economical, you can buy a streaming device if you want
 haalanki yadi aap keval cabel yaa dit content hi dekhnaa pasand karte hai to aapke liye smart tivi khareednaa sahi nahin hoga
 You can buy affordable non-smart tvs that focus more on size, resolution, and panel quality
 yah tisiel kaa sab-brands he
 The interesting thing about this TV is that it comes with similar specifications and features like the TCL 40S62FS and is priced at Rs 16,999
 kagaji taur par yah ek badhiya vikalp he
 This TV of VU brand is a great and affordable option for those who are looking for big screen tvs
 bhartiya market main is tivi kii keemat 17,999 rupee he
 This TV comes with a 43-inch full-hd resolution display and has a 20 watt sound output
 iske alaava tivi main do echdiemai port or ek yuasabi port diya gaya he
 Although this TV does not have smart connectivity
 yah 43-inch phul-echdi tivi ek aise brands se aata he jise kam log jaanate hai lekin 19,499 rupee main yah kai fitures se las he
 The TV has 60hz refresh rate, smart remote with built-in air mouse, key apps with smart connectivity support, three HDMI ports and two USB ports
 Cloudwalker brands kaa yah tivi 20,000 rupee se kam keemat main best spacification se las he
 The German brand Blaupunkt is commonly known for car audio systems and devices, but the company has ventured into the TV business over the past year
 bharat main company kii product renz kii shuruaati keemat 12,999 rupee he
 The range increases depending on the price and size but the BL43AF520 model is a capable option for less than Rs 20,000
 yah tivi 43 inch ke phul-echdi disple panel ke saath aata he
 Hardik Rana went to buy gold for his family at a jeweler on Friday
 aam taur par salanaa sabake liye sona liya jaataa he lekin philhal hardik kharidari main thodi jaldbaaji kar rahe hai
 The reason for doing this is the fear of the impact of GST
 hardik kehete hai ki aam taur par ye charchaa he ki jiesti ke aane se sone ke daam badhenge to behatar he pehle hi kharid lenaa
 GST has been announced from 1 July
 rana parivaar akelaa nahin he
 Many people are buying gold in Gujarat before July
 gujarat main pichley ek maheene main sone kii record aayaat darj kii gai he
 People fear that the current gold price is Rs 29,000 per 10 grams
 jiesti do se paanch pratishat badhane kaa logon ko andeshaa he
 In such a situation, there is a fear of increasing the price of gold per ten grams from 600 to 1200 rupees, so in the coming time, advance purchase of weddings is also being done
 tippaniyan If you look at the figures, gold imports in Gujarat in December 2016 1
 40 metric ton tha
 2 in January 97 metric ton ho gaya
 10 in February
 15 metric ton, march main badhkar 11
 45 MT

 The import of gold has increased to 39 MT and now in May it has increased to about 13 tonnes
 shahar ke agrani johari manoj soni kehete hai ki pichley 15 dinon main hi shahar main kareeb 30 se 40 pratishat bikri bad gai he
 They have the illusion that the price of gold will increase
 ek dar ye bhi he ki philhal to bikri badi he lekin jiesti ke lagu hone ke baad kahin ye aankada gir na jaay isliye johari or aam kharidaar bhi sone par kis tarah kaa jiesti sarkaar lagaati he iskaa intjaar kar rahe hai
 The Rana family is not alone
 kai log gujarat main july se pehle sona kharid rahe hai
 Gujarat has recorded record imports of gold in the last one month
 logon main andeshaa he ki maujuuda sone kaa bhav prati 10 gram 29,000 rupee he
 People expect GST to increase by two to five percent
 aise main prati das gram sone kii keemten 600 se 1200 rupee tak badhane kaa dar he isliye aane vaale samay main shaadiyon kii bhi advance kharid ho rahi he
 The comments aankadon ko dekhen to disambar 2016 main gujarat main sone kaa aayaat 1

 Manoj Soni, the city's leading jeweler, says that in the last 15 days only 30 to 40 percent of sales have increased in the city
 unako ye bhranti he ki sone ke daam bad jaayenge
 There is also a fear that sales have increased at the moment but after GST is implemented, this figure does not fall, so jewelers and common buyers are also waiting for what kind of GST government imposes on gold

 The report clearly states that the time of the encounter and the time of death are different
 esaiti kii report gujarat sarkaar ke liye sirdard se kam nahin he
 According to the report, the entire case was fake

 The High Court was directly monitoring the investigation into this encounter case
 adaalat ne pichley varsh vishesh jaanch dal kaa gathan kiya tha taaki muthbhed kii vaastaviktaa kaa pataa lagaaya ja sake
 The petitions of Ishrat's mother Shamima Kausar and Pranesh's father Gopinath Pillai were questioned over the police claim about the encounter
 maharashtra ke gruhanirmaan rajyamantri or shivasena netaa rabindra vaayakar par congress ne jameen ghotaale kaa gambhir aarope lagaaya he
 Former party MP and Mumbai unit president Sanjay Nirupam has said that he has evidence of all the allegations
 mumbai congress ke daftar main hui ek press conference main nirupam ne aarope lagaaya ki rabindra vaayakar ne aare colony kii 20 acre kii jameen hadap lee he
 a health center has been built on this land in the name of building a gym and gold bath for the tribals, the upper floor of which is unauthorized
 nirupam ke mutabik hadpi gai jameen kii keemat 20 karod rupee he or chaunkaane vaali baat he ki is jameen par bane health centre ko chalaane vaali sanstha vaayakar ke patni kii he
 Not only this, the Charity Commissioners do not even consider this institution registered with them
 kul milakar ek gaiyr-registerd sanstha ko vaayakar ne sarkari jameen kaa hissaa dilaayaa he or 27 lakh rupee kii sarkari madad bhi dilaai he, jo ki saraasar gaiyrkanoonee he

 Nirupam has written a letter to Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis demanding that Vikar be removed from the post and break the health center
 nirupam ke tamaam aaropon par abhi tak rabindra vaayakar ke daftar se koi safai nahin ai he

 is jameen par adivaasiyon ke liye gym or sona bath banane ke naam par ek health centre bana diya gaya he, jisaki upree manzil anaadhikrut he
 According to Nirupam, the value of the land grabbed is Rs 20 crore and it is astonishing that the wife of Vikar, who runs the health center, built this land
 yahi nahin charity kamisionar is sanstha ko unke paas registerd bhi nahin maanate
 Overall, an unregistered organization has provided a share of government land by the vicar and also provided government assistance of Rs 27 lakh, which is grossly illegal
 tippaniyan Nirupam has also claimed that the Aarey administration wrote to MHADA thrice in October, December 2014 and March 2016 and demanded the removal of the health center, but as a minister, Vikar is preventing MHADA from taking action under him
 
 nirupam ne mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis ko khat likhakar maang kii he ki vaayakar ko mantri ko pad se hataaen or health centre ko tod den
 So far no explanation has come from Ravindra Vaikar's office on all the allegations of Nirupam

 On one side is Pakistan, which has become the second name of terrorism around the world and on the other side is North Korea threatening the war, which has been declared a sponsor of terrorism by US President Donald Trump
 somvaar ko donald trump ne north korea ko teror sponcer desh kaa tamgaa pahanaate hue ghoshnaa kii ki ab north korea par or bade paimaane par aarthik pratibandh lagaae jaaenge
 The reason behind Donald Trump's imposition of the tag of being a sponsor of terror on North Korea
 unamem pramukh vajah ye hai ki duniya ko newclear tabaahi kii dhamkee dene ke alaava north korea ne baar-baar antarrashtriya aatankwaad kaa samarthan kiya he
 North Korea has also been involved in conspiracies to carry out killings on foreign soil
 america ke baar-baar kehane ke baavjood north korea kii sarkaar apane newclear program par roak nahin laga rahi
 Trump's decision to declare North Korea as a terrorist country is welcome, but the question is if in the eyes of Trump, North Korea is a terrorist country then why is Pakistan being a caliph of terror being given a discount? North Korea is just a threat But if Pakistan is notorious for carrying out terrorist attacks all over the world including India, then what are the compulsions under which Donald Trumppak Terrorists are not proving the country
 america kaa liye khatra bana north korianorth korea jab america ke sir par chadhakar naachne laga or america kii dhamkiyon se darane kii bajaay ulta america ko dhamkaane laga, to donald trump ko north korea ekatankvadidesh lagane laga
 In the eyes of the US, North Korea used to be the sponsor of terrorism till nine years ago
 lekin phir usapar se ye tag hataa liya gaya
 The way North Korea has tested the ballistic missile hitting the US and successful tests of nuclear missiles, it has become a threat to America once again
 trump ne is khatre kaa izhaar bhi kiya he
 If it was supposed to happen, Kidnald Trump would have declared North Korea as well as Pakistan as the sponsor of terrorism, because if Trump believes that North Korea's nuclear weapons are a threat to the whole world then he would also know that Pakistan was the one to give him the technology to make nuclear bombs
 north korea ko aatankwaadi desh ghoshit karte hue trump ne is baat ko nazarandaaj kyon kar diya ki north korea to sirf aatankwaad kaa samarthan karata he jabaki pakistan to bharat main aatankwaadi hamalon ko anjaam detaa he
 According to Trump, if North Korea is involved in carrying out the killings on foreign soil, then why are they forgetting that Pakistan is also the father of North Korea in this task
 america ko hui galatfahmiaisa lagata he ki donald trump ke liye aatankwaad myne nahin rakhata, sirf ek hi cheez myne rakhti he ki puri duniya america se dare or uski izzat kare
 As North Korea is not doing at all, it is a terrorist country and under pressure from the US, Pakistan rescued an American family from the clutches of the Haqqani network after five years
 donald trump ko ye galatfahami ho gai ki usne pakistan ke nat bolt tite kar die
 Love of Pakistan and hate of North Korea is America's trump trick on terrorism
 ek taraf north korea he jo iraan, sudan or syria jaise aatankwaad ke praayojak deshon kii list main shaamil ho gaya he, uske saath hona bhi yahi chahie tha
 But on the other side is Pakistan, which should have been number one in the list of countries sponsoring terrorism, but due to the double policy of terrorism, it is out of this list
 jis pakistan ko sabak sikhaane kii badi-badi baaten karke donald tranamerica ke raashtrapatibane
 He has now changed his heart towards Pakistan
 sach ye he ki trump pakistan kii naak main sirf utani hi nakel daal rahe hai, jitne se pakistan america kii naak main dam naa kar paae

 Chasing the target, Pakistan had quickly lost the wickets of Ahmed Shehzad (21), Khurram Manzoor (21) and Younus Khan (29), shocking the team's hopes of a series win by winning the Test, but led Azhar

 # navsarjangujarat The MLA sitting on a dharna in support of bjp's nearly 200 MLA Nand Kishore Gurjar sitting on a dharna in the Assembly, what happened on Tuesday in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly was one such incident in the politics of the state
 yaad is lihaaj se ki ek taraf uttar pradesh kii bijepi sarkaar bhrashtachar or suraksha ke mudde par vidhansabha main sarkaar kii uplabdhiyaan gina rahi thi, duusari taraf bijepi ke hi vidhayak nand kishor gurjar apni sarkaar se sawaal kar rahe the ki aakhir kyon unhen police or prashasan kii taraf se pratadit kiya ja rahaa he
 Nand Kishore Gurjar is an MLA from Loni assembly constituency of Ghaziabad
 nand kishor vidhansabha main apni aawaaj nahin uthaa paae, jiske baad vah sadan main hi dharne par baith gaye or unke samarthan main bijepi ke kareeb 200 or vidhayak bhi dharne par baith gaye
 Somehow after 6 pm, he was picked up from the assembly by assuring justice, but this unprecedented incident in the history of the assembly itself has revealed a lot
 padhein: UP sarkaar main yogi adityanath-keshav maury ke bich tanatani, karpshan par thanikya hai ghatana ke myne?is ghatana ke gambhir myne hai
 But before looking at it, it is necessary to understand what is the agony of MLA Nand Kishore Gurjar after which this whole atmosphere of a big cause was created
 vidhayakdharne par baithe aurasarkaarake liye asahaj halaat paidaa kiye
 The question here is not whether a legislator from the ruling party questioned the system in his government
 sawaal usase aage ye bhi he ki aakhir itane bade paimaane par aisa kyon hua or iske vaastavik myne kya hai?nand kishor gurjar kii takalif ke mutabik, loni ilaake main ek food inspector ne galat logon ko galat tareeke se meet vyavsaay ke liye license diya tha
 He voiced for this
 aarope he ki vidhayak ne food inspector ke saath marpet kii
 a lawsuit was filed against the MLA and his supporters on the same charge
 vidhayak kii shikaayat he ki is maamle main unki baat hi nahin suni gai or prashasan ne unhen nishane par le liya
 Nand Kishore's allegation is that he was not allowed to speak when he tried to speak in the assembly about it
 vidhayak ke gambhir aaropanand kishor bataate hai ki ilaake ke adhikari puri tarah se bhrashtchaar main duube hai or khuleam kehete hai ki pehle kii sapa-basapa kii sarkaron me sarkari kaaryo main choubees percent kaa kamishan chalata tha or ab ye kamishan attharah percent ho gaya he
 He also said this in the House on Wednesday
 vidhayak ke ye aarope gambhir bhi hai or sarkaar kii bhrashtachar par ‘jiro tolerance’ kii niti par dhabba bhi
 But this does not end here
 baat isse bhi aage bad gai jab nand kishor gurjar ko vidhansabha main naa bolne dene par bijepi ke kareeb 200 vidhayak dharne par baith gaye
 This is a very serious gesture
 isse kai sawaal uthte hai jo yogi adityanath ke liye bechaini kaa sabab ho sakate hai
 In this case, the opposition smells a big plan
 kya kehete hai vipaksh ke netacongress ke pradesh adhyaksh ajay kumaar lallu ko lagata he ki ye sarkaar ke andar kii khinchataan kaa nateeja he
 The Yogi government has failed on all important issues including corruption, safety of women, so their leaders are now raising their voice freely
 ajay kumaar lallu ne aise maahaul me naitik aadhaar par yogi adityanath ke istife tak kii maang kar daali
 Leader of the Opposition and senior leader of Samajwadi Party Ram Govind Chaudhary then goes on to say that
 200 vidhayakon ke ekasaath sarkaar ke khilaaf dharne par baith jane kii ghatana ko aitihaasik kehete hue unhone kaha ki ye baghawat ke sur hai jo safataur par ishaara karte hai ki bijepi ke zyaadaatar vidhayak yogi adityanath ko mukhyamantri ke taur par nahin dekhnaa chaahate
 He said that many mlas sat on a dharna against him, which means the government has come to a minority
 ram govind choudhary ne kaha ki kaha ki ye puri tarah se yogi adityanath ke khilaaf ek or kadam aage jane kaa maamla he
 The effect of which will be seen in the coming days
 dharne par baithne kii kiski planning?ab sawaal ye uthta he ki agar itani bady sankhya main vidhayak is tarah vidhansabha main kisi badi planning ke tahat dharne par baith gaye the to aakhirkaar ye planning kiski he? sarkaar ke bheetar hi koun he aisa he jo yogi adityanath ko mukhyamantri nahin dekhnaa chahta? kahin mukhyamantri yogi adityanath or sarkaar ke hi ek taqatvar mantri ke bich kii tanatani kaa ye aglaa kadam to nahin he?vaise sarkaar ke bheetar ke jaankaar ye bataate hai ki sarkaar ke bheetar sab kuch thik nahin chal rahaa
 Most of the mlas are angry about not listening to their views in the government
 to kahin ye naaraazgi ab lamabandi ke rup main takhtapalat kii ore to nahin bad rahi? in sab qayaason ke bich naaraaz or dharne par baithe kuch vidhayakon ko yogi adityanath ne milane ke liye bulaayaa
 Harsh Vajpayee is one of the BJP mlas to be met
 vah kehete hai ki ham sab nand kishor gurjar ke samarthan main hai
 But this is not a rebellion
 kam se kam hamaari sarkaar main hamen loktantric tareeke se apni baat kehane kaa mauka mila
 But on the question that if the government listens to you then why do you have to sit on dharna against such a large number of government? He did not reply to this
 harsh vaajapeyi samet dharne par baithe tamaat vidhayakon main se zyaadaatar ko yogi adityanath ke virdohi kheme kaa mana jaataa he
 It is clear that the legislators have united and given a message to the government that there is a huge strength in the strength
 vaise sutara ye bhi bataate hai dharne par baithe zyaadaatar vidhayakon ne uttar pradesh sarkaar ke ek sabase zyada rasukhwale mantri ke janmdin par ghar jaakar badhai di thi or khushi ke us maukey par utsaah main ye bhi kaha tha ki aap agar ishaara kar den to aapkaa aglaa janmdin ham mukhyamantri ke taur par manaanaa chaahate hai Former Finance Minister P

 Interacting with volunteers through a Google hangout, Kejriwal called for popularizing the steps taken by his government, particularly in the area of health and education
 372 bacchon ne jeii (mens) qualifi kiya, kejariwal ne di shaabaashiunhone kaha ki aap sarkaar rajdhani dilli main 100 pratishat sakshartaa praapt karnaa chaahati he
 Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal says that he is receiving complaints from the students of Delhi that they are not able to get admission in the colleges of their own city
 dilli raashtra kii rajdhani he
 It is for everyone and everyone is welcome here
 lekin dilli ke tex peyars se chal rahe collejon main kuch siten dilli ke chaatro ke liye arakshit honi chahie
 He said that i have requested Manish Sisodia to find reservation in 28 colleges
 aam aadmi party ne isse pehle bhi isi tarah kaa prastaav jari kiya tha
 With the high cutoff for admission in many colleges in Delhi, many students in the capital complain of not getting seats
 jald khatm ho jaaegi UGC or AICTE, jaane kya he vajahsaath hi, dilli ke chaatro ko un logon ke saath kadi takkar deni hogi jo dilli ke baahar se apni barahavin kaksha kii padhai puri karke aate hai
 Currently, Delhi Technology University and Indraprastha University and Indraprastha offer reservations to students living in Delhi
 kejariwal kaa kahana he ki dilli sarkaar kii shiksha yojana ke tahat shiksha rin maangane vaale chaatro ke liye guaranter ke rup main 10 lakh rupee tak ke prastaav ko badha diya gaya he
 He said that the scheme was launched for the students pursuing education in Delhi colleges
 ab ve duniya main kahin bhi padhai ke liye applai karne ke liye is yojana kaa laabh uthaa sakate hai
 It is true that Sachin Tendulkar's catch was actually dropped four times in the semi-final match of the World Cup 2011 held on 30 March
 unhone mahatvapurn 85 ran banaae or aakhirkaar pakistan is match main haar gaya
 India also won in the World Cup final on 2 April in Mumbai
 ye tathy us kansperesi theory ko sahaara dete hai jisamen kaha ja rahaa tha ki 26 / 11 ke hamale ke ghaav jhelane vaale shahar main pakistan ke cap jeetne kii sharmindagi se bachane ke liye yah mahatvapurn match fiks kar liya gaya tha
 The revelations in Ed Hawkins's new book, Bookie Fixer Gambler Spy, about fixing a semi-final match, have again given rise to a controversy that the cricket world loves to keep buried
 cricket ko chalaane vaale yah jaanate hai ki khel main prashansakon ke bharose ko jhatka dene kii baari keemat chukaani padati he
 More than half a dozen cricket stars were hit by stigma in 2000 when the Delhi Police overheard a conversation between a bookie and South African captain Hansie Cronje
 is buki ne baad main mohammad azahruddin or saleem malik kaa naam liya
 In 2010, three rising stars of Pakistan were caught red-handed taking money for spot-fixing
 is par yakeen karnaa aasaan he ki pakistan match khud hi haar gaya tha, kyonki uskaa ateet sandigdh rahaa he
 Pakistan players do not get much opportunities to earn money outside cricket legally
 yahi nahin, cricket ke avasaron ko bhi banaae rakhana unke liye mushkil hota he kyonki team main sthirataa nahin rahati
 An angry fan can easily believe that a defeat is not a human mistake but a pre-determined plan to lose
 yah maananaa bhi aasaan he ki pakistan bik gaya tha, bajaae yah maanane ke ki us din bharat ne behatar khel dikhaaya tha
 Perhaps Sri Lankan fans can easily assume that the 2012 T20 World Cup final was a match fix, which is easier than assuming that the winning West Indies team was better
 koi is baat kaa spashtikaran bhala kaise degaa ki aakhir westeindies ke kul 138 ranon kaa hi peechha karte hue srilanka kii team ne 13 ran main hi chaar wicket ganvaa die? bisisiai ke sachiv sanjay jagadale kehete hai ki aise vyaktiyon (hockins ke sandarbh main) ke bare main kuch nahin kar sakate jo sansanikhej daavon se apni pahchaan bananaa chaahate hai
 In his words, "I do not think that such allegations will lessen people's confidence about the credibility of the game
" log samajhate hai ki is tarah ke aarope kyon lagaae ja rahe hai, inke liye koi saboot nahin hai or log yah samajhane main bhi maahir hai ki yah sirf apni kitaab bechney ke liye publicity stant he
 It would be interesting to compare the shadow of suspicion built on cricket with the ongoing rumors about Lance Armstrong
 cycling ke vaishvik sanghathan union cyclist international (usiai) ne un par lage doping ke aaropon par bilkul dhyaan nahin diya
 When indisputable evidence of this came, he was finally forced to take action and Armstrong, one of the world's great personalities, came to the ground
 saath hi vishwa cycling ko bhi isse baari jhatka pahunchaa
 For the BCCI and the ICC, it is not surprising to bring the person who is suspected to be in a mess
 par sandesh ko najrandaaj karke ve khud ke liye sankat paidaa kar rahe hai
 If the BCCI and the ICC did not heed the warning signs, they might have the same fate as the UCI, which had no idea about how sophisticated and to what extent the doping mechanism is
 isi tarah isisi kii bhrashtachar nirodhi or suraksha ikai (asiesu) ko bhi yah samajhane kii jarurat he ki kis tarah se sattebaaji sindicket kaam kar rahaa he
 In his book, Hawking wrote, ACSU does not even have the basic knowledge of what brackets mean in the world of betting (a fixed period of the game during which betting occurs) and how easily the so-called fans can get information from side to side
 We do
 hockins ne landan se india today ko bataaya: ‘‘asiesu is bare main kuch nahin jaanata ki bharat main sattebaaji kaa bazaar kis tarah kaam kar rahaa he
 For example, people like Ravi Sawhney (former head of ACSU) did not even know what a bracket is
 asiesu ke karmchaariyon kii sankhya ko doguna karne kii jarurat he
 Only one officer represents both England and the West Indies and another officer represents Pakistan and Bangladesh
 asiesu ke karmchaaree aam taur par police se liye jate hai, aise cricket export ko nahin liya jaataa jinhone khel khelaa ho
 "over the years the betting industry has become quite sophisticated
 anumaan ke model taiyaar karne ke liye gahan sankhyikeey vivaran or pradarshan vishleshan kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 Information about the weather is easily available on the Internet, the nature of the pitch does not change overnight and is usually guessed a day before the game
 zyaadaatar maamalon main team kaaphi had tak logical rijning ke aadhaar par hi banaai jaati he-jaise ki agar os padi ho to bharat teen tej gendbaajon or ek spinner ke saath khelegaa
 Information is not confidential and performance patterns are analyzed
 bade maukon par kris gail or lasit malinga kaa naakaam rahanaa aam baat he
 Both of them also failed in the T20 final on October 7 this time
 kisi panter ne anumaan lagaaya hoga ki aisa hoga to aisa sirf isliye ki usne apana homework achche se kiya tha, is vajah se nahin ki khilaadi bik gaye hai
 If a poll is found to be correct, it means that the model of estimation has worked, not that the election has been rigged
 buki fiksar gambler spi ne cricket main bharose kaa sankat paidaa kar diya he
 This has shown to what extent the fixing has spread
 sattebaaji par kanoon laana sabase badhibia ilaaj he kyonki nigaraanee kii sthiti main kisi vyakti ke liye batch paanaa sambhav nahin hota
 Bookies have now spread their net in domestic cricket such as county cricket in England, Ranji Trophy and domestic and international T20 leagues
 bhartiya team ke purv spinner bishan singh bedi kehete hai, ‘‘asiesu yah to nahin pard saktaa ki kisi khilaadi ke dimag main kya chal rahaa he
 But he can see what is happening in the field
 khiladinnon ko khud hi is baat kii ijaajat deni chahie ki asiesu jaisi ikaiyaan unki nigaraanee kar saken
 For example, why do match referees go with the captains for a toss these days? Because if there was a mess in the toss once, there would be no way to stop them
 isliye yah samajhnaa ki maidan par kya ho rahaa he or use pakad paanaa jaruri he
 '' purv bhartiya captain sunil gavaskar ne indian premier lig se judi media or sanchaalan parishad sambandhi gatividhiyon ke liye prayek satr kii apni 10 lakh dollar (paanch karod rupee) kii maang thukraae jane ke baad aaj bhartiya cricket board par nishaanaa saadhaa
 Gavaskar said, BCCI took a U-turn on my contract
 main hairaan hum ki bisisiai ne meraa lambit bhugtan karne se inkaar kar diya
 i am moved by reading these reports
 is purv bhartiya captain ne daawa kiya tha ki bisisiai ke purv adhyaksh sharad pavaar or arun jetali ne unase vaada kiya tha ki unke bhugtan ko sweekruti mil jaaegi
 He told NDTV, both Sharad Pawar and Arun Jaitley had promised me that my payment would be approved
 mere peshkash se inkaar karne ke baad sharad pavaar or lalit modi ne mujhe chaar karod rupee ke ipel anubandh kaa vaada kiya tha
 The issue came up for discussion at the executive committee meeting yesterday after Gavaskar wrote a letter to the BCCI
 unhone kaha, maine bisisiai adhyaksh se aagrah kiya or unhone kaha ki unhen sirf pavaar se pushti kii jarurat he
 Pawar then spoke to (arun) Jaitley who assured me that the issue would be discussed in the meeting
 gavaskar ne kaha ki vah chintit nahin hai ki is vivaad kaa unke camentator anubandh par koi asar padegaa
 He said, i do not see any conflict with the contract
 ye donon do bilkul alag chijen hai
 One is a broadcaster's contract and the other is a commitment to IPL
 rashtriya cricket academy ke adhyaksh pad se anil kumble ke istife par pratikriya maangane par gavaskar ne kaha, agar koi uske (anil kii) jaisi vishwasaneeyata kaa vyakti kisi kaarykram ke bare main baat karata he to is par uchit tareeke se charchaa kii jaani chahie
 You may not agree with him 100 percent, but it will have to be seen what he is saying
 is diggaj salaami ballebaaj kaa maananaa he ki bisisiai ko kumble ke mudde se behatar tareeke se nipatna chahie tha
