 sires mistre ko tata group ke chairman pad se hataae jane ke ek din baad unke offis ne unke bare main ek khaas baat bataayi he
 His office said that soon after Cyrus became the chairman of Tata Sons, he asked the Tata group companies not to do any new contract with the Shapoorji Palonji Group
 bataa den ki shapurji palonji group unki paariwarik company he
 Mistry's office told NDTV, "in October 2013, Cyrus wrote to the CEO and manager directors of all Tata Group companies that Shapoorji Palonji Group should not be given any new work under better corporate governance
 ' unhone bataaya, iskaa parinaam yah hua ki tata group kii companiyon se shapurji palonji group ke saath kiya jane vaala kaarobaar naganya ho gaya
 Harish Salve has been a legal adviser to the Tata group for a long time
 jab unase poocha gaya ki kahin sires mistre ko tata sans ke chairman pad se achaanak hataae jane ke peeche hiton ke takaraav to nahin, kyonki aisi reportein hai
 To this he said, 'he has no such information
 ' Harish Salve said, i think such a decision has been taken for some bigger and more concrete reasons
 salve ko lagata he ki sires mistre or unke baad antarim chairman banaae gaye ratan tata ke bich mulyon main bada antar he
 "there was a general perception across the board that corporate governance needs to be revamped rather than fixing companies at the group level," Salve said

 The comments shapurji palonji group, tata sans main 18 fisadi share ke saath sabase bada shareholder he

 He said, as a result, the business done with the Shapoorji Palonji Group from the Tata Group companies became negligible
 harish salve lambey samay se tata group ke kanoonee salaahkaar rahe hai
 When asked if there was any conflict of interest behind the sudden removal of Cyrus Mistry from the post of Chairman of Tata Sons, as there are such reports
 is par unhone kaha, 'unke paas aisi koi jaankaree nahin he
 ' harish salve ne kaha, mujhe lagata he ki aisa nirnay kisi bade or adhik thos kaarnon se liya gaya he
 Salve feels there is a big difference in prices between Cyrus Mistry and then Ratan Tata, who was made interim chairman
 salve ne kaha, board main yah aam dharna punap rahi thi ki group ke str par companiyon ko thik karne ke bajaay korporate gavarnence ko durust karne kii jarurat he

 22 november, 2000 ko jharkhand vidhansabha kaa hua tha gathanjharkhand rajya ke siyaasi galiyaaron main ye andhvishwaas kitna he sach?siyaasi galiyaaron main aapane aksar kuch andhvishwaas bhari baaten suni hongi, jaise uttar pradesh ke bare main ek andhvishwaas khub prachlit he ki jo bhi netaa mukhyamantri rahete hue noida kaa daura karata he, vah satta se haath dho baithta he
 The state of Jharkhand is also not untouched by such superstitions
 jharkhand ke siyaasi galiyaaron main kaha jaataa he ki jo bhi netaa vidhansabha adhyaksh kii kursi par baitha, vah chunaav haar gaya
 It has been 19 years since Jharkhand Legislative Assembly became the new state of Jharkhand
 22 november, 2000 ko jharkhand vidhansabha kaa gathan hua tha, tabase lekar aaj tak yah sadan tamaam uthapatak dekh chukaa he or samay ke saath sadan main tamaam parivartan hote rahe hai
 The fact on which this superstition has been built is a historical truth of the politics of Jharkhand
 dilachasp he ki rajya main iske pehle ab tak 3 baar chunaav hue hai
 In 2005, 2009 and 2014
 vidhansabha main jo bhi netaa adhyaksh kii kursi par baitha, in teenon chunaavon main uski haar hui
 So far in the history of 19 years of the state, no person sitting on the chair of the assembly speaker has got electoral success
 2005 main jab jharkhand main pehali baar chunaav hua to iske pehle empi singh vidhansabha adhyaksh the
 MP Singh did not get a ticket due to Saryu Rai contesting from Jamshedpur West
 naaraaz vidhansabha adhyaksh ne rajd ke tikat par chunaav ladaa or haar gaye
 What does the political analyst have to say? Similarly, in the 2009 elections, Alam Geer Alam Sitting contested from Pakur as the Speaker of the Assembly, but he too was destined to lose and JMM won from here
 is chunaav main congress, rajd or jhamumo kaa gathbandhan nahin hua tha
 After this, in the 2014 elections also the three parties entered the field alone and in this election also, sitting speaker Shashank Shekhar Bhokta lost from Sarath seat of Deoghar
 jharkhand kii siyaasi baarikiyonko samajhane vaale raajnneetik vishleshak vaidyanath mishra ne bataaya ki yah ittefaq he ki koi bhi vidhansabha adhyaksh is myth ko nahin tod paaya, lekin ve chunaav kyon haare, iskaa tark spasht he
 CP Singh is the Minister for Urban Development in the Raghubar government's cabinet
 ve 2009 se 2013 ke bich vidhansabha adhyaksh rah chuke hai
 He is confident that the victory of current Assembly Speaker Dinesh Oraon from Sisai Assembly will break this myth about the Speaker's chair
 jo bhi vidhansabha adhyaksh kii kursi par baitha, vah chunaav haar gaya, yah baat ajeeb jarur lag sakati he, lekin jharkhand ke chunavi maahaul main sunaaya ja rahaa yah kissa kaaphi dilachasp he
 In Bihar, a hypocrite Baba has been caught by the police
 giraft main aayaa baba ilaaj ke naam par mahilaon kaa shaareerik shoshan karata tha
 Not only this, accused Baba used to get money from women after making them a victim of their lust
 police ne aaropee baba ko giraftaar kar jail bhej diya he
 On the day of arrival in the country, miscreants keep descending from Baba's faces
 samaaj ke har varg main faile nakli baba kahin santan sukh dene ke naam par to kahin tantra-mantra ke sahare ilaaj ke naam par vishwaas ko ghinaune khel main tabdeel kar rahe hai
 The latest case is from Kaimur district in Bihar
 giraft main aae farji baba kaa naam dharmraj goud he
 According to the police, the accused Baba Dharmaraja Gaud, a resident of Dasauti village, claimed to have treated women in the name of Tantra-mantra and chandelier
 mahilaon par prabhaav banane ke liye dhongi baba mahilaon ke saamne narmund ke saath bhi khelaa karata tha
 Police have found several Narmunds from Baba's room
 pehle farji ilaaj phir havas kaa kheladhire-dhire dhongi baba dharmraj goud ke ilaaj kii charchaa ilaake main hone lagi or mahilaayein uske paas aane lagi
 The accused Baba used to flaunt the treatment first and then intimidate the victim woman and make him a victim of his lust and make money from them
 aarope he ki baba netantr-mantraki aad main ab tak kai mahilaon ko apane jaal main fansaaya hai
 Accused of giving divine darshan The charge of accused Dharmaraj Gaur opened when a woman who came to him for treatment, took him to a secluded place by pretending to have a divine darshan
 vahaan pahunchakar aaropee ne peedit mahila ke saath jabardastee kerani shuru kii to kisi tarah mahila vahaan se bhaag nikali
 Objectionable paraphernalia recovered from the house, the woman rushed directly to the police and told about her case
 jiske baad police ne fouran harakat main aate hue aaropee baba dharmraj goud ko uske ghar se giraftaar kar liya
 Police also found a lot of objectionable items from Baba's house
 police ne dhongi baba ke khilaaf mukadmaa darj kar use jail bhej diya he
 Accused Baba has already gone to jail JDSP Manoj Ram said that accused Baba had been making women his victims for a long time
 dspi ne bataaya kidhongi babadharmraj goud isse pehle bhi dakaiti jaise sangeen maamalon main jail kii hawa kha chukaa he
 The DSP said, at present, the police is investigating the case
 saath hi police pataa lagane kii koshish main juty he ki aaropee ne tantra-mantra ke naam par ab tak kitni mahilaon ko apane jaal main fansaaya he
 US President Donald Trump said in a meeting with Russian officials at the Oval House last week that the sacking of FBI director James Komi has reduced pressure on him because he was not a good man
 yah daawa ek media report main kiya gaya he
 The Times reported that Trump told Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and the Russian Ambassador to the US that he had just sacked the FBI director
 vah vastav main thik vyakti nahin the
 According to the American daily, this information and other excerpts were told by the Trump administration official in front of the reporter
 dainik samachar patr ne trump ke hawaale se kaha, 'main rus kii vajah se kaaphi dabaav main tha
 Now that has been removed, i am no longer under investigation

 ) dharna yaa soch ek aisi cheez he, jise alag-alag vidwaanon ne apane-apane dhang se samajhaayaa he
 If someone calls it a reality, then someone says that there is no such thing as truth, only an assumption
 narendra damodaradaas modiko agar apni paribhaasha gadhani ho to ve isamen ek or baat jod sakate hai ki dharna ek dudhari talwaar he
 If element of impatience and rapture is added to it, it can evaporate and fly away
 ek netaa jo sachmuch kar dikhaane or samruddhi laane ke vaadon par savaar hokar itane jor-shor se rashtriya manch par avatarit hua tha, aaj vah hichkole kha rahaa he
 His car is stuck between the shaking of his insane brother-in-law and the mutual opposition of his own failures to maintain control of the wheel as a winner
 bijepi ke netritv vaali endie sarkaar maheene bhar baad jab apni pehali varshganth kaa bhavy jashn manaane kii baat joh rahi he, aise samay main india today samooh or sisero ne vishesh janamat surveykshan 'desh kaa mizaaj' karavaaya he jo jamini sachaai kaa pataa lagane kaa kaam karata he
 Now this government's honeymoon is over
 isaki pehali gavaahi to dilli main 10 farvari ko khuli iviem mashiinon se milti he
 In the weeks that followed, the manner in which the opposition was revived, created a deadlock in Parliament and the government's mercury rolled downwards, all this reinforcing the same fact in more detail
 pichley 10 maheene ke dauraan sangh parivaar ne rajnatik aparipakvata or chunavi adoordarshita se bhare faislon or maangon kaa jis kadar vishavaman kiya he, usne honeymoon ke taabut main aakhri keel thonkane kaa kaam kiya he
 Now India is beginning to raise the question of whether the satraps which he sat on the throne of Gandhinagar on the summit of Raisina Hill, will be able to bypass the forces of intolerance and bigotry that have kept this historical mandate on the track Burglary has started
 shaayad yah kisi bhi nae pradhanmantri ke kaarykaal ke pehle hi saal main uski lokapriyata main ai yah sabase tej giravat hogi kyonki pichley saal agast main jahaan 57 pratishat logon ne desh kaa mizaaj surveykshan main modi ko pradhanmantri pad ke yogya tehraaya tha, aaj vah dar ghatakar sirf 36 pratishat rah gai he
 These figures can be a bit disturbing for a candidate who has been creating new slogans of development and new slogans of governance in his election campaign
 is badlaav ko agar muhaavarey main baandha ja sake, to kahana chahie ki aisa lag rahaa he, goyaa ghadi ke kaante ulate gum rahe hai yaa phir samay kaa pahiyaa puraa ghoomane vaala he
 Narendra Modi's metamorphosis as a leader who has been synonymous with Gujarat's growth, development and growth from a leader who has been condemned for many years to the communal massacre of Gujarat is among the most passable stories in the politics of modern India
 unki is kamyaabi ne us samay nayaa aayam hasil kar liya jab rashtriya falak par ubharate hue modi ne khud ko aise shakchas ke rup main pesh kiya jiskaa bharat ko besabri se intjaar tha, jo ghotaale, kahili or ahankaar ke us adhyay ko palat detaa jisaki chapet main aakar desh rasaatal main gote khaane ke khatre se do-chaar tha
 An agitated India looking for relief expressed confidence in his claim and most people cannot deny this
 aakhirkaar, modi vikaas or sushasan kii nai chhavi ban kar ubhare the
 The main reason for this was that his quiver was completely emptied by those poisoned arrows of religion and bigotry which his ideological peers have been staining from time to time and have been climbing new steps of infamy
 modi ko iskaa shrey jaataa he ki ve apni shandaar jeet ke baad bhi apane mul muddon par tike rahe or rajkaaj ke apane dhaanche se vivaadaaspad masalon ko baahar rakhane ke apane sankalp se nahin dige
 Apparently, the leader who had reached thousands of people through an unprecedented election campaign must have had some sense of the pulse of the people
 bijepi ko jaisi shandaar jeet mili, vah sahajabodh ko abhibhoot karne ke liye kaaphi thi
 This gave rise to a fake feeling and assurance that the country has finally given its verdict and embraced an agenda that aims to incite people, divide them and establish dictatorship
 iske baad to lav jehad, ghar vaapasi, hindu raashtra or logon ke padhgaye-likhane, dekhne-samajhane, khaane-pine, pahanane-olyde se jude sanak bhare faislon kii surkhiyon ko vimarsh kaa shashakt hissaa banane main samay hi nahin laga
 Today, the mandate is left only a few pieces, reflecting the changing perception of why India must have actually voted for Modi when Modi was actually synonymous with what
 jin shabdon ke madhyam se yah dharna jaahir ho rahi he, ve bahut aparichit nahin hai or kal hi kii baat lagate hai
 Modi was sweated away from these words, such as religious polarization, communal intolerance and Hindu nationalism
 ye sirf ateet kii iklauti parachhaaiyaan nahin hai
 The RSS and its leaders were sweating profusely to bring the BJP back to power
 ise apratyaashit hi kaha jayega ki pichley das maheene main bijepi ke ye vaicharik abhibhavak or unka samoochaa parivaar bahut majboot hua he
 From repeated statements about all Indians being Hindus to imposition of Sanskrit in central schools suddenly in the middle of the academic session, decisions have proved that the heat of saffron power is now directly impacting the people
 puraa bharat is baat ko samaj rahaa he
 It has created a feeling among the people that Modi is ultimately not as free or sufficiently independent of RSS control
 apni sharton par kaam karne kaa sangharsh aisa lag rahaa he ki or kathin hota ja rahaa he, thik vaise hi jaisaa ehsaas atal bihari vaajapeyi ko dashak bhar pehle hua tha
 India does not delay in blaming and is not always wrong when doing so, even if its source of information and intelligence is tv's racy news and debates
 aaj kattar hindu sanghathanon ke zyada dheeth ho jane kaa dosha modi kii jeet par madha ja rahaa he or zyada-se-zyada awaajen aisi hai jo bharat ko hindu raashtra banane ke aresas ke sapane kaa virodh karti suni ja rahi hai
 If the Lok Sabha elections are held today, the BJP and NDA will know that the wave they came riding on has stopped and their boat has cracked
 desh kaa mizaaj surveykshan kahata he ki abhi chunaav hone par bijepi ko kul 27 siton kaa nuksaan hoga or vah girakar 255 par aa jaaegi, jo teen dashakon main pehali baar hasil spasht bahumat kii uski uplabdhi kaa ant hoga
 There was tremendous support six months ago and the party achieved a tremendous figure on 16 May
 is hisaab se endie ko kul siton main se 36 kaa nuksaan hoga or uskaa kanta 299 par tham jayega
 On the other hand, the history of a different kind that Congress had created in the last election by securing 44 seats, will cross the half-century by getting an additional nine seats to date, although this story is completely different
 jo dikh rahaa he, vaisaa hona nahin tha
 Modi's promise was about development, good governance, minimum government maximum governance, skill development, jobs, infrastructure, war on corruption, eradication of poverty, smart cities, clean country and good days
 is fehrist main vah sab kuch shaamil he jisaki bharat ko jabardast darkaar he
 This much is certain that they have not deviated from these goals and at least talk about them, although their critics have started saying that Modi's development agenda is actually for the original programs of the Sangh Parivar The mask was full
 isse kahin zyada aashcharya kii baat yah he ki kya modi apni vaicharik matra-sanstha se nipatane main naakaam hai yaa ve is bare main abhi vichaar hi kar rahe hai yaa phir yah bhi sambhav he ki ve kisi kism ke takaraav se bachane ke liye jaan-boojhkar uski karravaayiyon kii ore se apni ankhen munde hue hon taaki khud ko apane kaam par kendrit kar saken
 As far as the voters are concerned, they should be given credit that they are still following the third possibility
 modi ko ab bhi unke prayaason kaa shrey diya ja rahaa he or bharat ne abhi sari ummid nahin chodi he
 He is particularly credited most on the diplomacy front - his highly popular speeches in New York and Sydney, calling on US President Barack Obama as the opening guest on Republic Day, a garden walk with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and All such high diplomatic scenes, including a dinner with Chinese President Xi Jinping on the Sabarmati Riverfront, testify to this
 sone kii kadhai se apana naam likhe suut ko pahanane par tamaam jhidakiyon ke baavjood modi kii sabase badi uplabdhi duniya main bharat kii chhavi ko sudhaarna rahi he
 Global trends have been in favor of Modi on the economy front
 vaishvik tel keemten girane kii vajah se mudrasphiti main kami ai, jis vajah se rigerv bank ne byaaj daron main katautee kar di
 The atmosphere between the market and investors has been positive, the stock market touched new heights and there was no scope for more complaints regarding the 2015-16 budget
 'mek in india' vinirmaan kshetra kaa nayaa mantra he jo udaan bharne ko taiyaar he, saath hi sarkaar ne beemaa main ucchtar pratyaksh videshi nivesh or koyala tathaa khanij utkhanan main paardarshita ke liye sansadeey manjuuri praapt karne main kamyaabi hasil kii he
 Making the process of land acquisition easier is going to be the next big step which has been stuck with opposition from Congress-led opposition
 is sandarbh main dekhen to lagata he ki modi sarkaar ko lekar bharat utana adheer nahin he or un par bharosa kiye hue he ki ve shashakt aarthik kilabandi ke liye jaruri saamaan juta hi lenge
 Modi is praised for his slow recovery in the economy, even though his policy called Make in India is still on paper, while the Swachh Bharat program has led people to at least talk about the waste that surrounds them
 Have started sampradayikta ke mandaraate badalon par machi cheekh-pukaar ko agar unhone suvidhajanak tareeke se darkinar kar diya, to in badi kamyaabiyon se vah raahat mahasoos kar sakate hai
 The question arises whether his aim was simply that he be known as a person whose government has performed more than expected? Then their election campaigning will be in serious danger
 yahi sankat apane prati unki chhavi ko bhi paidaa ho jayega
 Even if he has left behind Indira Gandhi and Atal Bihari Vajpayee as India's best Prime Minister, what difference does it make? Modi must have understood the short-livedness of such perceptions because he has been in power for only 10 months, he is expected to live for at least ten years and the legacy he has to leave is still shaping Has not started ve itihaas par bhi nigaah rakhte hai, lihaaja, unhen yah bhi pataa hona chahie ki indira gandhi kii lokapriyata ko peeche chhodie ke liye unhen kuch or duuri tay karnaa baaki he kyonki 2001 main record 43 pratishat logon ne kaha tha ki ve ab tak kii sabase badhibia pradhanmantri thim
 The Congress can breathe some relief and be inspired to take the lead afresh by covering its 44 pieces
 pehali baat, aaj kii taarikh main zyada logon ko aisa lagane laga he ki congress agle paanch saal main ubhar sakati he
 There is enough solid support behind him to make Rahul Gandhi the next president of the Congress
 congress ke adhyaksh ke taur par sonia kaa pradarshan kamjor hua he, haalanki rahul kii vajah se party main peedhishon ke bich ai daraar se upje vibhaajan ke khatre ko thaamne ke liye sonia ne kaman apane haath main le lee he
 Arvind Kejriwal, the Chief Minister of Delhi and the head of the Aam Aadmi Party, would have considered himself lucky on the strength of this survey if he had not been in trouble today, but in March, the decreased activity within his party has shown that a spectacular victory in the election alone Everything does not happen
 yah surveykshan march ke ant main aap ke bheetar paidaa hue sankat se pehle kiya gaya tha isliye us vakt tak log kejariwal ke moh main fanse dikh rahe the
 In terms of choice as the Prime Minister of India, this former officer of the Indian Revenue Service is standing right behind Modi, but he still has to get rid of the political craze on him
 philhal, rahul, sonia, kejariwal or anya netaa apni suvidha se ek kadam peeche hat sakate hai
 Modi has got the mandate to run the country and people have issued a warning through this survey about which direction they prefer to take this country, and what things the government should avoid
 ab captain modi par he ki ve apane jahaaj ke paal ko durust kar lete hai yaa phir ishaaron kii andekhi kar khataron ko nyotaa dete hai, kyonki bhartiya votaron ne baar-baar dikhaaya hi he ki ve kitne sangdil ho sakate he
 The level of happiness of human being can be measured
 dubai main sarkari sevaaon se janata kii santushti or khushi donon kaa maapne kii vyavastha banaai gai he
 Electronic devices will be used in this work
 khushi maapne ke upkaran ek kendriya network se jude rahenge
 This system is called 'happiness Meter'
 meter se sarkaar ke adhikari jaan sakenge ki kis seva se janata ko santushti mil rahi he or kisase nahin
 Sheikh Muhammad bin Rashid Al Makhtoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the ruler of Dubai, said, "it is not our ambition to produce quarterly or annual reports to measure people's satisfaction and happiness
" kyonki aaj duniya bahut teji se badal rahi he
 Therefore government services should be measured daily
 'khushi maapne kaa meter smart sarkaar or smart shahar banane ke liye uthaae gaye kai kadamon kaa hissaa he
 Under which the impact of government services will be enhanced using technology
 unhone kaha ki isse dubai aane waalon ko bhi dubai yatra ke apane anubhavon kaa moolyankan karne main madad milegi
 Dubai is the first city in the world to measure daily satisfaction and happiness from government services of the people
 congress kaaryakari adhyakshon ne shila dikshit kii kaaryastylee par sawaal uthaae hai
 Three working presidents of Delhi, Aaron Yusuf, Devendra Yadav and Rajesh Lilothia have expressed their displeasure by writing a letter to Rahul Gandhi
 kaaryakari adhyakshon ne block cameti bhang karne or paryvekshakon kii niyukti ko galat bataaya he
 Apart from this, PC Chacko, incharge of Delhi Congress Committee has also written a letter to State Congress Committee President Sheila Dixit
 pisi chaako ne aarope lagaaya he ki unhen bina soochna die shila dikshit ne 14 jila congress cameti paryvekshak or 280 block congress cameti paryvekshak niyukt kiye hai
 Chacko alleged that this was a one-sided decision about which he had not been given any information before
 dilli congress main yah foot us samay dekhne ko mili he, jab congress main netritv kaa sankat gaharaaya hua he
 Rahul Gandhi has resigned from the post of Congress President after a bitter defeat in the Lok Sabha elections
 iske baad jyotiraditya sindhiya samet congress ke kai netaaon ne istife kii peshkash kii he
 As far as Delhi is concerned, out of the seven seats in Delhi in the Lok Sabha elections, the Congress did not win a single seat
 saaton siton par bijepi ne fatah hasil kii thi
 Former Chief Minister Sheila Dixit was not even spellbound by the people of Delhi
 iske alaava dilli kii sattarudh aam aadmi party ke bhi khate main ek bhi seat nahin ai thi
 G-4 countries agree to temporarily waive the right to veto for permanent membership in the UN Security Council
 lekin china phir bhi jhukne ke liye taiyaar nahin he
 Beijing has given a tight response to the issue

 Whenever we remember the stories of our childhood, it feels like why did we grow up? The reason behind this is clear - children have no responsibilities of any kind, they can do it whenever they want

 5-year-old Ana Wang from China takes care of the house so well at such a young age that you cannot even think
 daadi or paradaadi kii jimmedaari is maasoom par he
 Ana Wang's life is very different from the rest of her age
 uski dincharya main shaamil he apni daadi or paradaadi kaa khyaal rakhana
 The only person to take care of these two elders is the 5-year-old innocent Ana
 bataaya jaataa he ki jab vah teen saal kii thi, to uske pita ko jail ho gai thi
 After the father goes to prison, Ana's mother remarries and is left to her grandmother, while she learns that both of these women are physically unable to take care of Ana
 tippaniyan You will be surprised to know that Ana works alone from cleaning the house to bathing and cleaning both the elders
 ana har din jaldi uthati he taaki uske saare kaam time par puure ho jaaen
 There is no one to help this little life
 kichan kii slip tak pahunchane ke liye wo pehle ek stool par chadhati he or phir aage jhuk kar khaanaa banaati he
 Her neighbors help her a little, she brings vegetables from her farm to the house
 khilne-kudane kii umr main ana jo kaam kar rahi he, isse to saaf he ki is duniya main kuch bhi asambhav nahin he
 In this age where children do not understand things well, today Ana is playing worldliness at the same age

 The comments aapako yah jaanakar hairaani hogi ki ana ghar kii safai se lekar, donon bujurgon ko nahalaane or saaf karne kaa kaam akeli karti he
 Ana gets up early every day so that all her work is completed on time

 To reach the kitchen slip, she first climbs on a stool and then bends forward and cooks
 uski padosi unki thodi madad kar detii hai, vah unke khet se ghar ke liye subjiyan laa detii hai
 From the work that Ana is doing in the age of playing, it is clear that nothing is impossible in this world

 When Digvijay recently said about Nitish in Delhi that he is a secular person but his association is wrong these days, Nitish said that i think Digvijay Singh Mridul and Spartan were considered politicians but recently The kind of statement he started making in days is quite explosive
 unhone kaha ki singh aajkal aisa bayaan kyon de rahen hai, yah unke liye shodh kaa vishay he
 Nitish said that he is surprised that the Congress party is not taking those statements seriously
 mukhyamantri ne kaha ki esadiaref ke gathan kaa nirnay liya ja chukaa he or gathan kii karrwai chal rahi he tathaa isse aapadaa ke samay main bachaav kaaryon main sahaayta milegi

 Hasanain's friend, his neighbor in Kasar Vadwali, Thane, adjoining Mumbai, is still in shock
 koi yakeen hi nahin kar paa rahaa ki kaise ek insaan apane parivaar ke 14 logon ko maut ke ghat utaar saktaa he? hasanan ke naanaa gulzaar varekar kii to aawaaj hi maano gaayab ho chuki he
 Ghazala, who lives in a neighborhood that grew up with Hasnain, is not willing to believe that Hasnain can do it
 police main mutabik hasanan varekar ne shanivaar raat pehle gharavaalon ke saath party kii phir der raat maa-baap, patni, bachche, bahan or bhaanje-bhangiyon sahit kul 14 logon kaa galaa ret kar qatl kar diya
 But Sister Subia survived somehow despite being badly injured
 uske shor machaane par padosiyon ne khidki kaa gril todakar use baahar nikaala
 But by then Hasnain committed suicide in another room
 vaardaat kii iklauti chashmadid gavaah hasanan kii bahan subia ke gale main 25 taanke aae hai
 According to the police, his health has not improved so much so that information related to every aspect of the incident can be obtained from him
 vaardaat ko anjaam dekar hatyare kaa khudakushi kar lenaa kanoon kii bhashaa main vaise to ye shat and close cese he
 But this shocking incident is no less than a puzzle as no suicide note is found by chance
 jaahir he police ke liye is paheli ko sulajhaa paanaa aasaan nahin he
 That is why the police is also investigating the mind aspect of Hasnain from the property dispute to the investigation of the case
 hasanan baqarid ke din khud qurbaani detaa tha
 The sacrificial knife is used in the murder
 jaanch ke daayre main wo dargah bhi he, jiske trustee hasanan ke pita anwar varekar the
 The comments thane police ke sahayukta ashutosh dumbare ke mutabik vaardaat ke pehle tak hasanan kis-kis se miltaa tha, uname kya baatcheet hoti thi, phone par kis-kis se baaten hui thi, sab kuch kii padtaal kii ja rahi he
 Hassanen's mobile and laptop are also trying to know the truth
 pataa chalaa he ki july 2012 main bhi uske gharavaalon ko food poijaning kii vajah se aspataal main bhartee karana padaa tha lekin tab police ko suchit nahin kiya gaya tha
 Police say that there is still some suspicion that something must have been added to the dinner on the night of the crime, which will be confirmed only after the medical and forensic report
 hasanan ke saath hi pali badi pados main rahane vaali gazala to ye maanane ko taiyaar nahin he ki hasanan aisa kar saktaa he
 According to police, Hasnain Varekar had a party with family members on Saturday night and then late night strangled a total of 14 people, including parents, wife, children, sister and nephews
 lekin bahan subia buree tarah jakhmi hone ke baad bhi kisi taranh batch gai
 When he made a noise, the neighbors broke the window grill and took him out
 lekin tab tak hasanan ne duusare kamare main khudakushi kar lee thi
 25 stitches have come to the neck of Subani, sister of witness Hassanain, the only witness to the incident
 police ke mutabik abhi uski tabiyat main itnaa sudhaar nahin hua he ki usase vaardaat ke har pahalu se judi jaanakri lee ja sake
 It is a shut and close case in the language of the law to commit suicide by committing a crime

 subhash chandra kushvaha kaa nayaa kahani sangrah 'lala harpal ke juute' haal hi main penguin prakaashan se relies hua he
 It has a total of 13 stories
 pesh he kahani 'lala harpal ke juute' kaa ek ansh:lala ne kuch hi dinon main apni pahchaan america juuton se bana lee thi
 Or rather, that, despite participating in the freedom struggle and wearing native khaddar for a lifetime, the American shoes that they could not identify were quickly changed
 isliye lala ne apane tamaam puraane vichaaron or aadarshon ko gairajruri, bekaar maanate hue tilanjali de di thi
 a glimpse of the change in Lala's thoughts was also visible in the villagers
 kul milakar lala kaa gaanv, global gaanv kii ore sarakta najr aa rahaa tha
 Whether the shoes were on the feet or in the hands, Lala used to look at Gaj ?? b's Ravani
 lala kii bhashaa style main bhi badlaav aa chukaa tha
 Now instead of Bhojpuri, he used to speak all the words of English in a standing dialect and in between
 gaanv waalon ko gariyaate samay kai baar angreji ke shabdon kaa prayog karte
 The abuses given in English seemed to be more intelligent and restrained, and started to believe that Lala
 magar ‘sab din hot na ek samaanaa, e saadho
 
 
 Say Maya of Nirgun of Bideshhi or negligence of Lala, one day the same pugnacious bitch who had not forgotten to give her a crush since childhood, Lala, chewed a shoe
 chaba to vah doosraa bhijaati par tab tak lala kii nigaah pad gai thi or unhone badhavaasee main dandachala diya tha
 The target was absolutely fixed
 ek taang latakaae, any, any kartipurab kii ore bhaag khadi hui thi chitakabari, magar jabade se daaen pair ke juute komukt nahin kiya tha
 Even if Sasuri left the remains, she would go on to show that a pair of shoe sons-in-law Babu from the US for a hundred dollars
 
 
 
 Sawan's fair was close
 gaanv vaale mela jane kii taiyaari kar rahe the
 Thousands of people from nearby gathered in the fair
 aise hi maukey par juute ko pahananaa behatar jaan padaa tha lala ko
 Along with American shoes, Lala's glory could shine
 bas yahi soch kar kai dinon se man mahua ke kaanch kii tarah gadraya jaan padane laga tha
 He began to see his rubber slippers with more hatred, which he would often put on his feet to protect American shoes
 pehle kii tarah vah bideshi ke nirgun gayaki kii tarif bhi nahin karte
 They do not know when the tail of such a cow's backwardness started to appear
 barsaat ke kaaran juuton main fafoond lag gai thi
 When Lala saw it, there was a surge in her soul
 bas kya tha, neem kii sor par baithkar lage chamakaane
 There was pain in rubbing hands
 saans phoolne lagi thi
 Bideshini rubbed the khaini and placed it on the palm, but was told that the brushes were being rubbed
 ‘ab rahane bhi dijie
 No more work? When you look at the shoe, when you see, then the shoe
 itnaa prem to hamase bhi nahin kiye kabhi?’laline ne baahar aakar tokaa to lala ne muskura kar bideshi kii ore dekhte hue jawaab diya,‘heere kii parakh johari jaanata he
 "oh! Stay tuned jeweler
 ’ haath jhatak kar, khisia kar chali gai thim laline
 Such sentences were common in lala-lalaine
 so lala or bideshi ne udhar dhyaan nahin diya
 Bidesh wanted to draw Lala's attention to village politics a few times, but Lala did not show special interest
 bole, ‘chhodie gaanv kii baat
 Pardhan is filling his pocket, we are dying in the care of the village of Nahaq? 'when the cloud burst, then put the shoes in the sun, went to bring hookah from the verandah
 bas isi bich pataa nahin kahaan se aa tapaki thi chitakabari
 As long as Bideshree Durr 
 
 durr
 
 
 By then, the shoe had been stuck in the jaw
 bideshi kii aawaaj sunate hi lala kii nigahen satark ho gai thim or unhone gariyaate, daudte hue sadha danda chalaa diya tha
 Although it does not seem very present to mention this thing, yet it is to be told that on the day the incident took place, the American soldiers put their feet on the Iraqi jin
 to us saal sawan kaa mela naga ho gaya
 There was no desire to wear slippers made by cobbler
 isse america juuton dwaara bani pahchaan ke bighad jane kaa khatra mahasoos hua
 On the other hand, the eyes of the gamma wrestler kept searching Lala again and again in the fair
 har saal vah lala se sau-dau sau rupye inaam to le hi letaa tha
 Now only one shoe was left with Lala
 lala ne laline ke lakh kehane ke baavjood iklaute juute ko phenkaa nahin or na mochi ko diya
 Admittedly, there is no longer the same attraction
 ek juute kii kya upyogita? phir bhi lala ne chamakaane kaa kaam band nahin kiya

" iskaa andaja aap khud laga sakate hai
 He warned the Dalits that if BJP comes to power, it will abolish reservation for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes on the pretext of reviewing the Constitution

 If it is split then BJP will benefit
 haalanki musalmaan matadaata bilkul khamosh hai or ve yah jaahir nahin hone de rahe ki unka rujhaan kis taraf he
 He said that Punia, who was a Member of Parliament from Barabanki in the year 2009, can get the benefit of the development work done in the area during his tenure, but the coalition candidate Ram Sagar also cannot be underestimated
 gathjod ke baad unhen basapa kaa bhi pakkaa vot milane kii sambhaavna he
 Hashmat said that as far as BJP candidate Upendra Rawat is concerned, the party he belongs to has its own solid vote bank
 upendra ko bhaajapa kaa puraa vot milane kii sambhaavna isaliye bhi he, kyonki uske kor voter upendra kii shakl main pradhanmantri narendra modi ko vot de rahe hai

 sp-bsp's vote seems to have doubled, which seems likely to benefit Ram Sagar
 unhone kaha ki musalamaanon kaa vot puniya ko bhi mil rahaa he or ram sagar ko bhi
 Punia is getting the benefit of his work, his behavior, but the equation of alliance is becoming a challenge for him
 bhaajapa kii koshish he ki muslim vot main zyada se zyada bantwaaraa ho jaae taaki vah jeet jaae
 Mustafa says that Muslims are absolutely silent
 vah puniya ke saath bhi dikh rahaa he or ram sagar ke saath bhi
 As has been the case before, he decides his position at the last moment
 yah halaat hi barabanki ke chunavi ran ko dilachasp bana rahe hai
 However, walking in the area shows that there is a fierce competition between the candidates of BJP, Congress and coalition here
 agadi jatiyon ke sampann logon ke liye modi ab bhi pehali pasand hai
 However, small traders and lower classes come - the other options also appear to be effective
 barabanki loksabhaa seat ke itihaas par najar daalen to varsh 1951—52 ke loksabhaa chunaav main congress ke mohan laal saxena to varsh 1957 main congress ke hi swami ramanand shastri chune gayi
 However, in the by-elections held this year, socialist leader Ramsevak Yadav won the election from here
 uske baad 1962 or 1967 main bhi vah kramash: socialist party or sanyukt socialist party se saansad rahe
 In the year 1971, this seat again came to the Congress
 vahiin, 1977 or 1980 ke loksabhaa chunaav main yah bhartiya lokdal or janata party secular ke paas chali gai
 During the 'indira Lahar' in 1984, Kamla Rawat won elections on a Congress ticket

 However, it is also certain that it will not be easy for the government to pass the GST due to pressure from the opposition
 sarkaar ne sanket die hai ki vah jiesti paarit karwaane ke liye vipaksh se baatcheet karegi or buudhvaar kovitt mantrine beti kii shaadi ke nimantran ke bahaane hi sahi is ore pahal kar di he
 Music will be echoed in the ceremony, the celebration of Sagegi tunes is told that the wedding of daughter of Finance Minister Arun Jaitley will be decorated by the santoor maestro Shiv Kumar Sharma and Bollywood singer Mika Singh

 What will happen this time? This time, some major changes can be seen in the iphone
 haalanki duusari companiyon ke liye OLED screen puraani ho gai he, lekin pehali baar ap is screen ke saath iphone utaar saktaa he
 The second change can be that there will be a fingerprint scanner on the back of the phone, while the facial recognition feature can be given in the front
 haalanki iphone 7s or iphone 7s Plus main bade badlaav kii ummid to nahin kii ja sakati he, kyonki ye tradishan ke mutabik iphone 7 ke apgrade ke taur par aaenge

 At the moment it is not clear whether Touch ID will be included in the display
 kyonki kai reports main yah daawa kiya gaya he ki is baar tach idi ko biometric scan ke taur par yuj kiya jayega
 That is, from here, the iphone can be unlocked through facial recognition

 yahaan dekhen gane kaa video: When the second draft of the National Register of Citizens arrives in Assam, the politics has not stopped but the Bharatiya Janata Party has talked about identifying citizens in the same way in West Bengal
 bengal bijepi ke adhyaksh dilip ghosh ne kaha he ki agar unki party kii sarkaar aati he assam kii tarah hi bengal main bhi rashtriya naagarik register (NRC) jari kiya jayega
 In support of the release of the entire draft of NRC in Assam, he said that some leaders are shedding 'crocodile tears' as they anticipate the end of their 'vote bank' politics
 bataa den ki assam main bahupratikshit rashtriya naagarik register (enarasi) kaa antim masauda somvaar ko jari kar diya gaya
 Assam is the only state in the country where NRC has been issued, with a total of 3 in the northeast state
 29 karod aavedakon main se 2
 There are names of 89 crore people
 jabaki kareeb 40 lakh log avaidh paae gaye hai
 Bangladesh will send illegal citizens, Dilip Ghosh said, "if BJP comes to power in West Bengal, we will implement NRC in the state as well
 humlog avaidh nagarikon ko bangladesh waapas bhejenge
 The days ahead are full
 humlog kisi avaidh pravasi ko pashchim bengal main nahin bardaasht nahin karenge
 Not only this, Ghosh even said that those who support illegal migrants will also be expelled from the country
 ghosh ne kaha, 'supreme court ke aadesh ke anupaalan main assam menenarasi lagukiya gaya he
 It was the Congress which introduced the idea of NRC
 ab ve iske khilaaf bol rahe hai
 "he said," Those whose names are not in the final draft can appeal for amendment but we will not compromise the security and integrity of the country
 'bataa den ki pashchim bengal kii sattadhari party trinmul congress ne padosi rajya assam main enarasi ko lekar virodh jataayaa he
 CM Mamta Banerjee said on Assam NRC that despite many people having Aadhaar card and passport their name is not in the draft and despite correct documents people were not included in the draft
 mamata kaa kahana he ki kaaphi logon ko sarnem kii vajah se baahar kiya gaya he
 At the moment, where Mamata is questioning the Assam NRC itself, the statement of BJP leader Dilip Ghosh is also very important
 kyonki agar rajya main satta parivartan hone kii sthiti main aisa kuch hota he to siyasat or bhi garma kar sakati he

 Elderly people are using mehndi here to give their beard an orange color
 apane is nae biard luk ko lekar taher kehete hai, 'mujhe dadhi par mehandi lagaana kaaphi pasand he
 After applying mehndi, it is difficult to tell the happiness that comes from the color of beard that comes out
 main apni dadhi ke majboot baalo ko lekar bhi kaaphi khush hum
 "the best thing about mehndi is that it dyes your beard's white and gray hair in orange, while black hair has no effect on it," says Taher
 iske alaava baalo kii sehat or aapaki skin ko bhi kisi tarah kaa khatra nahin hota
 'shuvo Das, who works with fine hair dressers in Dhaka, says that this trend had almost disappeared from the market for a long time

 He says that many religious books mention the dyeing of Prophet Muhammad in his hair
 isliye kai log is rang kii dadhi ke saath khud ko unka anuyaayi bataate hai

 Tendulkar said in the presence of Gavaskar, "we grew up watching you play
" mujhe cricket khilne ke liye prerit karne main dhanyavad
 i just wanted to follow in your footsteps
 unhone kaha, jab main lagbhag 12 saal kaa tha, to us vakt main kaaphi niraash hua tha, kyonki mujhe sarvshereshth junior cricketer kaa puraskaar nahin mila
 i got a letter from Gavaskar, which said that if you look at this list, there is not a person's name in it and this person (gavaskar) did not do badly in Test cricket
 tendulkar ne hameshaa apana saath dene ke liye bisisiai ko bhi dhanyavad diya, phir chaahe vah acha pradarshan kar rahe hon yaa nahin yaa phir chotil hon

 Tendulkar also thanked the BCCI for always supporting him, whether he was doing well or not or was injured

 Now both of them will have to be patient and patient to express their satisfaction on surviving their stronghold and be ready to play the role of opposition
 jayalalita ne tamilnadu kii 39 main se 37 siten jeetin or diemke kaa safaya kar diya
 At the same time, Mamta won the victory in 34 of the 42 seats of West Bengal and the Left Front was reduced to two

 She was also looking forward to the Third Front and, unlike Jayalalithaa, was also exploring possibilities outside West Bengal
 unhone jharkhand, assam, uttar pradesh, tripura or mizoram main bhi pratyaashee utaar die
 His cadre had also started selling the idea of his Prime Minister, but these voices and voices came to a halt when the names of some of his party came under the Saradha chit fund scam
