 The film is entirely about yari-dosti
 dilli kaa maahaul, yahaan ke madhyavargeey launde or hansi-thitholi sab kuch he
 There are many such things as Jhand, Tota and Kuku, which enjoy the culture of Delhi and the local flavor here
 isamen mata kaa jaagran sijan-2 se lekar nirmal baba, fasebuk par pyaar or dilli ke raajma chawla tak aise piroe gaye hai ki swaad aata he
 The film offers fun in pieces but remains a bit loose in the affair of a weak story
 kahani main kitna damkuku (siddharth gupta) dilli kaa bin maa kaa baccha he, pita ke oonche khwab hai to kuku mahashay ko apana restaraan kholana he
 He has an ongoing friend Ronnie (ashish Juneja)
 kuku kii yahi koshish rahati he ki vah apni jhand hone se kaise bachaae
 Just for that, all his life is there
 doston main takaraar, colony ke tote se pyaar or bhi kaaphi kuch he
 There is no need to keep much of the story in the film
 yah dher saare kairactors kaa jamaavada he, jo apane-apane tareeke se gudgudane kii koshish karte hai
 All stars of Star Appealfilm are new
 lekin sabhi ne hi thik-thaak kaam kiya he
 There is not much to do in the film for Simran Kaur Mundi
 siddharth ne kuku ke taur par acha kaam kiya he
 On the other hand, Ashish is also fine in the film
 amtivi vije siddharth bharadwaj ne is film se kariyar shuru kiya he or wo oke hai
 It is a low budget film, which is all dependent on the youth connection as there is no different story in the film
 sirf dilli kii bhashaa or yuva tewaron ko lekar ise banaaya gaya he
 Kucu Mathur's Jhand Ho Gayi is a fun release this week with a serious film like Citylights releasing as spice will be present for both types of audiences
 agar kuku maathur yuvaaon ko apni ore khinchne main safal rahi to yah sleeper hit sabit ho sakati he

 Mandate 2019 / Uttar Pradesh As the election of the first phase of Lok Sabha elections in western Uttar Pradesh is approaching, Gurjar politics is also catching heat
 agra main samaajawaadee party sapa ke varisht gurjar netaa or purv rajyamantri ramsakal gurjar ke bhaajapa main shaamil hone ke baad gurjar siyasat main machi hode or tej ho gai he
 There is a significant number of Gurjar voters in western UP
 yahaan gajiabad, noida, bijanour, sanbhal, meerut, saharanpur, kairana sansadeey siton par gurjar matadaataaon kii sankhya prayek main ek lakh se adhik he or apane isi sankhya bal se ye matadaata in siton par nirnaayak hai
 The largest and most well-known leader of Gurjar society in western UP, who was equated with Jats, was Hukum Singh of BJP
 hukum singh kii mrityu ke baad bane shunya ko bharne ke liye pichley varsh hue kairana upachunaav main bhaajapa ne inaki beti mriganka singh ko tikat thamaya lekin vah rashtriya lokdal kii pratyaashee tabassum hasan se najdiki mukaable main haar gayi
 Tabassum Hassan comes from the Muslim Gurjar community because of this she has no acceptance in the entire Gurjar society
 sapa ne bhi noida ke vyavsaayee or gurjar netaa surendra nagar ko rajyasabha sadsy banaaya lekin vah bhi pashchimi upi main gurjaron ke sarvamaanya netaa nahin ban paae
 Senior farmer leader Angad Singh of Kairana says, “in the 2017 assembly elections, the Gurjar voters voted for the BJP unilaterally
 chunaav ke baad inhen niraashaa haath lagi jab pradesh kii yogi adityanath sarkaar main ek bhi gurjar ko mantri nahin banaaya gaya tha
 The growing discontent in the Gurjar community got a boost when Priyanka Gandhi, the newly appointed National General Secretary of Congress and in-charge of Eastern UP, arrived in Lucknow for the first time in February along with her fellow West UP in-charge Jyotiraditya Scindia
 congress ne pashchimi upi ke prabhavi gurjar netaa or mujffarnagar ke mirapur vidhansabha seat se bhaajapa vidhayak avatar singh badana ko party main shaamil kar gurjar siyasat main bhagava dabadabe ko chunauti di
 To compensate for Bdana, the BJP gave a big blow to the SP-BSP alliance by joining Gurjar leader Chaudhary Aveerendra Singh, a seven-time MLA
 gurjar netaa virendra singh sapa se vidhaan parishad sadsy hai
 His son Manish Singh is also the District Panchayat President of Shamli
 gurjar samaaj main bharpoor prabhaav rakhane vaale vijendra or manish kii jodi saharanpur, kairana loksabhaa chunaav main bhaajapa ko kaaphi madad pahunchaa sakati he
 To ensure that the Gurjar voters do not lose their grip, the BJP has made Ashwini Tyagi of Meerut a member of the Legislative Council, while Pradeep Chaudhary, an MLA from the Kairana Assembly seat, has tried to bring a new leadership in the Gurjar society by making him a candidate from the Kairana Lok Sabha constituency
 saaf suthri chhavi vaale pradeep choudhary hukum singh ke rutabe ke saamne kahin bhi nahin tikte hai
 There is also a tinge of Gurjar voters that despite being equated with Jat, no leader from their society has been able to establish their identity on the national plank
 kairana ke vayovruddh vakil raajapaal singh kehete hai “hukum singh ke baad gurjar siyasat dishaheen ho chuki he
 There are many Gurjar leaders in western UP, they are all confined to their local areas
 jat birdari kii tarah gurjar birdari main ekta nahin he
 This is the reason why the representation of Gurjar leaders in the government is negligible
 ”bhaajapa ke prati gurjar samudaay kii naaraazgi ko ubhaarne ke liye congress ne padosi rajya rajasthan ke up-mukhyamantri sachin pital ko pehle or duusare charan ke chunaav ke liye pashchimi upi ke prachaar abhiyaan main utaarne kii taiyaari kii he
 Gurjar leaders like BJP candidate from Kairana, Pradeep Chaudhary, BSP candidate from Bijnor, Malook Nagar are trying their luck in the Lok Sabha elections

 i think he will do well with the new ball, but once the ball flashes, the fast bowlers will find it very difficult

 However, BJP leaders claim that the middle brother, who has spent three years (2011-2015) in jail on illegal mining charges

 He said in Bengaluru on 26 April, 'I have forgiven him (janardhana Reddy) and many others who had created problems for me earlier
 unka samarthan hamaare liye madadgaar hoga
 "the truth is that the bjp's chief ministerial candidate also shared the stage with Reddy at a rally in Chitradurga district on 21 April

 The Congress tried to discredit me
 '' reddy philhal jamaanat par hai or unke apane grih jile bellari main daakhil hone par roak lagi he

 Then why did the BJP give tickets to the Reddy brothers? He (BJP) should answer to the people
 ''sach to yah he ki janardan reddy bhaajapa ke liye shame se kahin zyada mushkil sabit ho rahe hai

 rajya main pradhanmantri modi kii chunavi reliyon se pehle 29 april ko unhen chitradurg se bedakhal kar diya gaya
 BJP leaders in Karnataka, however, say that while Yeddyurappa is standing behind him with full force, there is no possibility that Janardhana Reddy will abstain from campaigning for long

 Listen to them, "I am saying only two things to the people

 The elephant is eager to sit on the lotus lap
 '' rajnatik pandit ganit laga rahe hai ki abdullah is seat par nawab ko to haraa denge, par aise main yah seat bijepi kii jholii main ja sakati he
 In the darkness of night in the village of Pipli Nayak in Swar, adjoining Uttarakhand, Abdullah replied, "the roads you have reached here have been built here in the last year and a half

 People feel for the first time that they are reaching Jamhooriyat from the Nawabi phase

 This is also evident from the old mansion at Bareilly Darwaza in Bareilly, where the poet Wasim Barelvi, who had been holding the pulse of time since Nehru's era, lived
 akhilesh ke bare main barelvi kehete hai, ''utrar pradesh kaa saubhaahgya hoga, agar yah aadmi waapas satta main aata he

 The Congress account was not open here last time

 So, this time the hard work between the BJP and the Muslims due to polarization will spoil the game of BSP, SP? The next day, Azam Khan, who was on a promotional campaign, replied, "we know to add a relationship

 jahaan tak baas ko impress karne kii baat he to is maamle main chamachagiri nahin chalegi
 But you have to be serious about these 7 habits - 1
 apane bos kii jimmedaariyon or chintaaon ko samajhen
 Do the work in such a way that you can connect yourself to their priorities
 2
 Do not pay attention to the bad things of the boss, pay attention to their positive things
 is ek quality se aap apane bos ke or bhi najadik aa sakate hai
 3
 aap kaam main kitna acha kar rahe hai or kya nayaa plan kar rahe hai, is bare main bos ko suchit karen
 4
 kisi galati ke ho jane par maafee maangana koi galat nahin he
 Doing this shows that you are not arrogant and are always ready to take feedback from the boss
 5
 Occasionally you go out with the boss for lunch and coffee
 aisa karne se aap donon ke bich achche relation banate hai
 6
 hameshaa yaad rakhen ki aapke bos ke upar bhi ek bos he, jise khush karne kaa kaam aapke bos kaa he
 In this case, help them to fulfill their boss's target
 is tarah big bos or aapke bos kii najar main aapkaa kad or ooncha ho jayega
 7
 us samay jab offis main har koi aapaki kaamiyabi kii tarif kar rahaa ho, tab us samay aap apane bos kii saraahna karnaa naa bhoolen kyonki bina bos kii madad or protsaahan ke koi bhi karmchaaree aage nahin bad saktaa

 ferj kiijie koi shaks kisi sangeen gunaah ko anjaam de or use sajaa kii bajaay inam mili, to phir nateeja kya hoga? jawaab sidhaa sa he, inam paanevaala shaks phir se vahi gunaah karegaa jisaki vajah se use pehle hi sajaa milani chahie thi
 The story of Gudiya's criminal is similar to this
 pehle bhi kar chukaa he ghinauni vaardatji haa, paanch saal kii maasoom bacchee ke saath balaatkaar ke iljaam main giraftaar manoj kaa ye pehla gunaah nahin he
 According to the police, Manoj had raped a girl earlier too, but instead of sending her to jail, the girl's family got her married to the same daughter
 kya aap jaananaa nahin chahenge ki akhir manoj kii jindagi kii baaki kaa sach kya he? to suniye, paanch saal kii nanheen gudiya ke saath balaatkaar ke iljaam main giraftaar kiye gaye manoj kaa ye pehla gunaah nahin he, balki manoj se judaa nayaa sach to ye he ki us par shaadi se pehle bhi balaatkaar kaa hi iljaam lag chukaa he or wo bhi usee ladki ke saath, jisase manoj ne shaadi kii
 We are not saying this, but it is claimed that those officers of Delhi Police are going to interrogate Manoj himself
 police kii maane to manoj ne aaj se koi do saal pehle apni hi patni ke saath tab jyaadati kii thi, jab donon kii shaadi nahin hui thi or baad main jab ye maamla khulaa, to ladakiwaalon or gaanvvaalon ke dabaav main manoj ne usee ladki se shaadi ke liye haa kar di
 At that time, people were hopeful that instead of getting caught in a legal mess, Manoj could get his life back on track if he was given a chance
 magar, afsos, manoj ne sudharne kii bajaay or bhi bade gunaah ko anjaam diya
 The wife and mother-in-law also demanded strict punishment
 Now it is probably the result of Manoj's misdeeds that his wife and mother-in-law are demanding a severe punishment for his actions
 uski saas kaa to yahaan tak kahana he ki agar manoj ne vaaki kisi maasoom ke saath aisa sangeen gunaah kiya he, to phir use faansee kii sazaa di jaani chahie
 Not only this, Manoj, a resident of Muzaffarpur, has been booked three years ago for 2010 for allegedly entering a girl's house with impunity and in this case he has spent one and a half months behind bars
 shaayad ye uski harkaton kaa hi nateeja he ki uske pita ne ise khud se alag tak kar diya tha lekin phir ye apane pita ke paas hi dilli laut aayaa or yahaan aane ke baad ek garment factory main kaam karne laga or phir ek 15 april ko isane apane hi pados main rahanevaali mahaz paanch saal kii ek ladki ke saath balaatkaar kii aisi ghinauni harakat kii jisane puure mulk ko baichaiyn kar diya

 Many Vastu defects are prevented by worshiping Lord Ganpati
 vaastu purush kii prarthana par brahmaji ne vaastushastra ke niyamon kii rachana kii thi
 It was built for human welfare, so the members of the house have to suffer physical, mental and economic loss if they are ignored, so it is better to worship Lord Ganesha for the satisfaction of the Vaastu deity
 shri ganesh kii aradhana ke bina vaastu devtaa ko santusht nahin kiya ja saktaa
 If you want to remove Vaastu defects without sabotage, try them
 sukh, samruddhi va pragatiyadi ghar ke mukhya dwaar par ekadant kii pratimaa yaa chitra lagaaya gaya ho to ho sake to duusari taraf thik usee jagah par ganeshji kii pratimaa is prakaar lagaaein ki donon ganeshji kii peeth milti rahe
 In this way, applying the image of the second statue helps to mitigate Vastu defects
 bhawan ke jis bhaag main vaastu dosha ho, us sthaan par ghi mishrit sindur se swastik diwaar par banane se vaastu dosha kaa prabhaav kam hota he
 An image or image of Vakratund can be placed in the south and south corners and in any part of Shri Ganeshghar or workplace, but while applying the statue, it must be kept in mind that in any case, it should not be facing south or south
 iskaa vipareet prabhaav hota he
 a picture of Ganesha sitting at home and Ganesha standing at the work place should be put
 kintu yah dhyaan rakhen ki khadey ganeshji ke donon pair jameen kaa sparsh karte hue hon, isse kaary main sthirataa aane kii sambhaavna rahati he
 It is auspicious to place the idol or picture of the pleaser in the Brahma place of the building i
e
 in the center, in the north and east direction
 ganeshji kaa chitra nahin lagaana chahie, jahaan logon ko thukne aadi se rokna ho
 For those who want happiness, peace and prosperity, a statue of Vinayak in white color should be painted
the worship of Sinduri colored Ganpati is favorable for those who wish for auspicious Sindhuri ganeshsarva Mangal on har avasar par shubh sinduri ganeshasarv mangal kii kaamana karne waalon ke liye sinduri rang ke ganpati kii aradhana anukool rahati he
 In the statue or picture of Vighnaharta, the trunk is rotated towards his left hand, this should be kept in mind
 daaen haath kii ore ghumi hui sound vaale ganeshji hathi hote hai tathaa unki sadhana-aradhana kathin hoti he
 It is important that laddoos and mice are very popular to God and modak and his vehicle is a mouse, so while painting in the house, keep in mind that the picture must have modak or laddus and a rat
 is tarah aap bhi bina tod-phod ke ganpati pujan dwaara vaastudosh ko dur kar sakate hai

 He saw that many people surrounded the peacock's cage
 jab log chale gaye to kauwa mor ke paas pahunchaa or bolaa, tum itane sundar ho
 Hundreds of people come to see you every day, but on seeing me, they start driving away
 mujhe lagata he ki tum sabase khushhaal pakshi ho
 Peacock said: i also thought that i am the most beautiful and happy bird in the world
 lekin meri sundarataa kii vajah se mujhe zu main band kar diya gaya

 ji haa, aisa ham nahin kah rahe, balki unki kuch harkaton se aisa sabit ho rahaa he ki unki chalbajiyaan jail main bhi jari hai
 Indrani forged signature of her husband Peter Mukherjee and wrote to two banks that he was surrendering his rights
 jaankaree ke mutabik, mumbai ke sindicket bank or newjiland ke ek bank main indrani or peter kaa joint acount he
 Peter's lawyer has complained in the court that Indrani forged signature of Peter and wrote letters to the managers of both banks that he was surrendering his right from the deposited money and fixed deposits
 is tarah indrani puraa paisa hadapna chaahati thim
 Actually, Indrani Mukherjee was neither able to withdraw money from these accounts nor was she able to break the fixed deposits without the signature of her husband Peter
 isliye usne 1 farvari ko sibiai court se kuch kagajaat par dastakht karne kii anumati maangi thi
 On August 4, the court also granted permission
 lekin jab peter ke vakeelon ne dekha to ve sann rah gaye
 When Peter's lawyers asked him about the signature on this paper, he denied it
 iske baad vakil ne turant court ko is bare main jaankaree di
 cbicourt has ordered both banks not to take any action on the letter written by Voindrani, while orders have also been given to investigate the matter

 Suddenly the door opened and a man stood in front
 kandhe par aalaa lataka hua tha
 He fluttered between some incomplete sentences saying the name and saying a fan
 pal bhar main sambhala, lekin tab tak ankhon se aansu baahar aa chuke the
 He wanted to maintain the dignity of being a doctor but due to being a Kashmiri, he was full
 main jitna kashmir se dur jaataa hum, kashmir utana hi kareeb aa jaataa he
 i stood silent
 vah mujhase gale milane ke faasale par khadaa rahaa
 He kept his eyes on the other people there, but could not stop himself from saying that
 mujh tak aane se pehle usne apni maa se baat kii thi
 Mother is a psychopath
 unhen kuch pataa nahin kashmir main kya hua
 His son was standing in front of me
 bolaa maa ne danta ki main itane dinon se phone kyon nahin kar rahaa tha
 i could not answer
 12 dinon se main kaise khud ko sambhaal rahaa hum bataa nahin saktaa
 There was silence in the room
 ek doctor apane rone or kehane ke bich bahut saare ghobaar liye khadaa tha
 Had he embraced, his words would have been left behind, so he stood in front of him
 sab kuch chhod kar sunne laga
 'put everyone in a bracket
 koi algaavvaadi he to koi samvidhanvaadee
 Some vote, no one gives
 vahaan alag-alag bracket rahe hai, lekin ab sabko ek kar diya gaya he
 i have always considered integrating in India, but now it is being said that you will have to integrate
 main india ke liye doston se bahes karata tha
 Used to explain to the people of Kashmir
 aaj main tanha ho gaya
 Lost all his arguments
 koi mujhe samajhane vaala nahin he
 i could not talk to my mother
 kuch pataa nahin chal rahaa he ki ghar main kya ho rahaa he
 Every single day is overshadowed
 hamaari ye haalat kar di gai ki ham phone se baat na kar saken or media kahata he ki ham sab kush hai
 This media has left us nowhere
 aapse ek sawaal karnaa he
 "why do the Hindi-speaking people of North India hate us so much?" What do they know about us? Do they know what is the problem of Kashmir
 har kisi kii itani opinian kisne banaai he
 The doctor was swept away in his impulse
 ab vah ek mariz kii tarah puch rahaa tha or main ek doctor kii tarah sunata ja rahaa tha
 He has become a patient
 use mariz bana diya gaya he
 In between, he speaks English to handle himself
 phir faiz kii nazmen sunaata he
 Then he takes care of me and starts talking to me in Hindi
 kabhi kashmir to kabhi maa to kabhi media kii baaten karne laga
 The media lies have broken a good enough man as much as the government has not decided
 har vaakye ke saath faiz or unki nazm ke ek tukade ko dawa kii tarah gatakta rahaa
 Today i understood the significance of being a faz
 ham sabhi ko apane aise kisi din ke liye kisi shaayar yaa kavi ko yaad rakhana chahie
 If he remembers, then his eyes and poems will be remembered
 kya pataa ham andheri surang main bhi zindagi kaat den
 'wrong with Kashmiri Pandits
 nahin hona tha
 Did not go wrong with us kya ham ye deserve karte the? ki hamen apane se baat tak nahin karne diya gaya
 We could not ask the family members till recently
 ' 'aapane hamen gharon main kyon band kiya
 When we are happy with the decision, why are we not allowed to leave? ghar waalon se baat karne kyon nahin di gai
 'two people from the same country
 ek chor par sampark se kaat diya gaya doctor khadaa tha
 At one end, i felt immersed in the sea of the Hindi state where newspapers and channels filled such a large part of India with lies and hatred
 kya kisi kaa vyaktigat prayaas karodon logon tak fail chuke jhooth or propeganda ko dur kar saktaa he? nahin
 Hindi states are cursed states
 hindi or hindi pradesh ko uske akhbaaron se azaad hona hi hoga
 Otherwise, he will make his readers another Kashmir in the name of Hindi
 soochna ke naam par suchnavihin kar denge
 You should beware of Hindi newspapers and channels
 aap zehar ho rahe hai
 The doctor continued to speak
 'ek jatke main sab khatm kar diya
 Hearing the false news of this media, people are asking me that you people are very happy
 poocha tha hamase pehle, bataaya tha hamen, jab faisla liya to hamen ghar waalon se baat nahin karne di
 Tell me to the policeman
 usne kara di
 Thank you very much
 ''dar lag rahaa he ki koi ghar waalon ko uthaa kar to nahin le gaya
 Brain is being torn by thinking
 ham apane logon ke bich andeh kii nazar se dekhe ja rahe hai
 No matter how much i want to be Indian, Kashmiri is seen
 ab to kashmiri pahchaan bachegi, pataa nahin
 'I don't remember his words verbatim now
 sirf yaad he ki ek shaks kaa bharbhara janaa
 In his shattering, the promises that we all Indians make to each other are to be filled
 is lekh ko pard kar faisle lene vaale log hans sakate hai
 You can be happy that they have made the condition of a common man
 unke paas kitni taaqat he
 Congratulations to them on this victory
 itihaas bana he
 History of lies
 kamare main uski baatcheet lambii hoti ja rahi thi
 He kept changing things to keep his tears from appearing
 lekin uskaa dimaag ek hi jagah atka rahaa
 He could not understand why he was cut off from Kashmir? Why was her house cut off? Why couldn't he talk to the mother for 12 days? She pulled out the phone
 number dial kiya
 Started telling that i have called at home a thousand times for two weeks
 har baar yahi awaz sunai detii he
 The operator's voice is heard in English, Kashmiri and Hindi
 'aapane jinhen kol kiya he, unki inakming kol kii seva sthagit kii gai he
 'I had nothing to say
 sunne ke liye dhiraj tha
 Kept listening gale lagane kii pehali shart he
 We have to listen first
 jate-jate gale laga liya
 a young man was stunned to see his identity with a lot of questions on his shoulder
 ghar aakar bibisi hindi par kashmiri pandit shweta kaul kaa ek lekh padhane laga
 'people are not ready to understand such a basic thing that justice and sense of revenge are not the same

 For this, players are uprooted on the condition of passing the test

 Instead of being lured in, facilities should be provided for them and on the basis of performance, if the government job is given without any condition, then Haryana will continue to flourish not only in boxing but also in other sports

 Here, in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Kripal reached the Parliament after winning the election on a Shiv Sena ticket
 anusuchit jati varg ke liye arakshit yah seat kabhi congress kaa garh hua karti thi, lekin 1999 main shivasena ne yahaan apana khaataa kholaa

 After this, in 1989, he was successful in winning from here
 bataa den ki 1957 se lekar 1998 tak congress kaa garh rahi he
 The first Lok Sabha election here was won by Krishna Rao Gulabrao Deshmukh
 phir 1962 main madhavrao bhagwant raav patil chunaav jite
 He was followed by Amrit Ganpat Sonar twice in 1967 and 1971

 After three consecutive victories, Shiv Sena started calling the Ramtek Lok Sabha seat its stronghold
 lekin 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav main nattejey alag rahe
 Here the Congress returned and Mukul Wasnik won the elections
 unhen sarkaar main cabinet mantri banane kaa mauka bhi mila
 But this victory of Congress did not last long

 Portugal's team and their fans must have been deeply saddened after the bitter defeat to Germany, but a tear of gum would have lashed the deserts of Dubai with cold rain
 shaayad yahi kaaran he ki mangalvaar ko bhavishyavaanee karne ke dauraan shaheen ke andaaj main maayusi thi
 Shaheen has bet on Brazil for the match between Brazil and Mexico

 Although everyone's eyes will be on Brazil today on Shaheen's new prophecy, but Shaheen will not get sleep
 gauratlab he ki shaheen kii pichhali chaar bhavishyavaaniyan bilkul sahi sabit huin
 Shaheen predicted on Sunday that Argentina would win in the match between Argentina vs Bosnia and Herzegovinia
 argentina ne bosnia ko 2-1 maat di
 The victory of Italy on Saturday night and the victory of Brazil and the Netherlands before that gave strength to Shaheen
 badale-badale se janabemangalvaar ko shaheen kii taaja bhavishyavaanee kaa jo video saamne aayaa usamen bhavishyavaanee karne ke andaaj main berukhi saaf dikhaai detii he
 Although Shaheen has placed his bets on Brazil for the match between Brazil and Mexico, he did not show enthusiasm like previous predictions in the Brazilian election
 jaisaa ki ab tak hota aayaa tha, bhavishyavaanee ke dauraan shaheen apni pasand kii team ke board ko daanton tale dabaakar use hawa main uthaa letaa tha, lekin mangalvaar ko brazil ke board ko usne sirf apane munh se dhakka dekar gira diya
 In such a situation, it is being feared that the grief of Portugal's defeat is haunting Shaheen! However, it is expected that if Brazil wins today, Shaheen's enthusiasm will return again

 Narendra Modi once again attacked the Prime Minister and the Congress on Sunday and said that the Congress has changed history and geography
 modi gujarat ke jila kheda main ek muslim trust ke cheritable aspataal kaa udghaatan karne pahunche the
 Narendra Modi first gave his speech about health
 kuch der bolne ke baad unhone mazaakia andaaj main kaha ki yahaan log kuch or sunne aae hai (unka ishaara kuch raajnneetik tippinyon kii taraf tha
 ) After this, Modi started a political speech and countered and made sharp attacks on the Prime Minister
 modi ne kaha, 'kal (shanivaar ko) pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne chhattisgarh main bhaashan diya
 It would have been good if he had spoken something about inflation, it would have been good if he had said something about corruption, but unfortunately the PM told the story of history and geography and went away
 'PM se sahamat hum, oonchi baaten karne se safalataa nahin miltinarendra modi ne pradhanmantri par waar karte hue kaha, 'kal aapane kaha tha ki oonchi baaten karne se safalataa nahin milti
 i agree with you 100 percent and the example of this is the election of Gujarat
 log hakeekat ko sweekaar karte hai, baton ko nahin
 People who kept talking kept people away from power
 yah sabit ho gaya he
 Tell the Prime Minister, who changed the geography? In Modi's speeches, the Congress was accusing him of changing history and geography so far, based on the error of some facts
 lekin ravivaar ko modi ne congress ko is par gheraa or bhaavnaatmak baton kaa zikr kiya
 Narendra Modi told the Prime Minister that the geography has changed by the Congress
 modi ne kaha, 'piem sahab aap jis gaanv main paidaa hue the, vah gaanv kabhi hindustan kaa hissaa tha, lekin ab nahin he
 So in this case, you tell who changed the geography
 ' modi yahi nahin ruke, unhone kaha, 'china ne hamaari dharti par kabja kar liya he
 The place that once belonged to us, we do not have it today, who changed the geography in such a situation? '' Gandhiji left, now Homodi mentioned a letter, wanting to leave the Gandhi Marg
 modi ne kaha, 'gandhi ne 1930 main dandi yatra kii thi
 The Congress leaders had announced the grant of funds from Sabarmati to Dandi (on which Gandhiji had made this journey) to be a heritage route
 lekin abhi tak dhan nahin diya he
 The question is not about giving money, the question is second, the question is that 6 months ago, the Congress Government wrote to me that instead of making Heritage the route Gandhi ji walked, we should take it 30 kilometers a little
 to itihaas koun badalanaa chahta he?'jaahir he, narendra modi ravivaar ko phul form main the or pradhanmantri manmohan singh samet puri congress or unki nitiyon par jabardast prahaar kar rahe the
 Why do you call the freedom struggle a rebellion? Narendra Modi said after inaugurating the hospital on Sunday, 'PM ji, we respect you, but it is our compulsion to tell the truth
 yadi yah aapako chubhta he, ham kuch nahin kar sakate
 Modi said that the freedom struggle of 1857 was fought by people of all religions together
 yah aazaadee kii ladaai thi, lekin congress aaj tak ise baghawat kahati he
 This fight is taught in books as a rebellion
 kyon?modi ne is baat kaa zikr khud par lage un aaropon ke jawaab main kiya, jisamen kaha gaya tha ki modi ko itihaas kii jaankaree nahin he or galat tathy pesh karte hai
 The martyrs, Ambedkar and Patel were also forgotten: Modinarendra Modi said in his speech, 'the Congress has forgotten the martyrs living in the prisons of Andaman and Nicobar
 sardaar patel ne desh ko joda, par congress patel ke liye kya kiya? kuch nahin
 Nehru was given the Bharat Ratna when he was alive
 indira ji ko bhi jivit rahete bharat ratna mila, rajeev gandhi ko unki mrityu ke ek saal baad diya gaya
 But Ambedkar was given the Bharat Ratna 35 years after his death, why so long? Why was Bharat Ratna given to Sardar Patel after 41 years? ”modi also mentioned Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, Madan Lal Dhingra, Abdul Kalam Azad, JB Kripalani and Shyam Krishna and said that history is silent about these martyrs and those who died on their homeland Why is ant main kiya modi ne galati sudhaakapana bhaashan puraa karne ke baad modi ne apni ek galati sudhaarte hue kaha ki dharapravaah bhaashan ke chalate ve baar-baar shyama prasad mukherjee kar gaye, jabaki ve shyaam krishna ke bare main baat kar rahe the

 laalkrishna adwani ke nivas par bhaajapa ke aalaa netaaon or team anna ke sadasyon ke bich janalokapal bill ko lekar hui baithak ko donon pakshon ne sakaaratmak qaraar diya he
 Know what is Jan Lokpal? Team Anna member Arvind Kejriwal said that whatever questions the BJP had in mind about our bill were discussed
 bahut had tak bhartiya janata party hamaare bill se sahamat ho gai he
 Special coverage on Anna's agitation, Prashant Bhushan said that the final decision on the three issues on which there is a deadlock with the government will be decided after the government draft
 vahiin bhaajapa ke adhyaksh nitin gadakari ne bhrashtachar ke khilaaf anna hajaare ko purna samarthan dete hue kaha ki jan lokapal vidheyak ko hi sansad se paarit hone vaale lokapal vidheyak kaa aadhaar bananaa chahie
 Photo: Leader of opposition Rajya Sabha Arun Jaitley, who took to the streets for Anna, said, 'BJP had already made its stand clear about the Jan Lokpal bill
 hamaari party chaahati he ki pradhanmantri lokapal ke daayre main aaen
 The provisions of the constitutions should be kept in mind for implementing the bill
 jin praavdhaanon ko lekar hamaari party sahamat nahin he uski jaankaree team anna ko de di gai he
 Arun Jaitley said that the solution of this problem of the government will have to be found through negotiations
 jaane koun hai anna hajaaregyaat ho ki isse pehle party adhyaksh nitin gadakari ne jan lokapal vidhey ke kuch hi praavdhaanon kaa samarthan karne ke party ke ab tak ke ruukh main badlaav kaa sanket dete hue likhaa tha ki jan lokapal ko aadhaar bana kar niyamon or prakriyaaon se upar uth kar jald se jald sambandhit vidheyak ko paarit karne kaa prayaas hona chahie
 The Supreme Court issued a notice to the General Secretary of the Central Government, Election Commission, Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha in the matter of giving life pension and allowance to former mps
 supreme court purv saansadon ko aaajeevan pension or alouns dene ke khilaaf daayar yachika par jawaab maanga he
 However, during the hearing, the Supreme Court also said that we have seen the era when many politicians have died in Gurbat (poverty) even after serving as mps for a long time
 lokprahari naamak NGO ne yachika daakhil kar kaha he ki purv saasandon or vidhayakon ko aaajeevan pension di ja rahi he jabaki niyamon main yah shaamil nahin he
 The petitioner said in the Supreme Court that if a person becomes an MP even for a day, he not only gets a lifetime pension, his wife also gets a pension
 saath hi vah jivan bhar ek saathi ke saath train main free yatra karne kaa hakdaar ho jaataa he jabaki rajya ke garvanar ko bhi aaajeevan pension nahin di jaati
 Even the current judges of the Supreme Court and the High Court are not given the benefit of free travel for companionship
 chaahe vah aadhikarik yatra par hi kyon naa ja rahe hon
 In this way, this system is a burden for the common people and this system makes politics even more attractive
 agar asal main dekha jaae to yah kharch aise logon par kiya jaataa he jo janata kaa pratinidhitiv nahin karte isliye is vyavastha ko khatm kiya janaa chahie
 The NGO, named Lokphari, has filed a petition saying that former pensioners and mlas are being given life pension while it is not included in the rules
 yachikakarta ne supreme court main kaha ki agar ek din ke liye bhi koi saansad ban jaataa he to vah naa keval aaajeevan pension kaa hakdaar ho jaataa he, uski patni ko bhi pension milti he
 At the same time, he is entitled to travel free in the train with a companion for life, whereas the Governor of the state is also not given a lifetime pension
 yahaan tak ki supreme court or hoicourt ke vartmaan jajon ko bhi saathi ke liye muft yatra kaa laabh nahin diya jaataa
 Even if he is going on an official visit
 aise main yah vyavastha aam logon ke liye boj he or ye vyavastha raajnneeti ko or bhi lubhaavna bana detii he
 If seen in reality, this expenditure is incurred on people who do not represent the people, therefore this system should be abolished
 film 'hive' kii kahani shuru hoti he, aalia bhatta yani veeraa ke ghar se, jisaki shaadi kii taiyaari chal rahi he
 Hiding in the darkness of night, Veera leaves the house and walks out on the road with her fiance

 bhaagate hue trek kii police talaashi leti he or veeraa ke paas bachane kaa acha mauka he, phir bhi vah chhupati he or police kii najaron se bachati he
 In one scene of the film, Veera and Mahavir reveal the secret of their childhood
 is raaj main pataa chalata he ki bachapan main veeraa shaareerik shoshan kaa shikaar hui thi, vah bhi apane hi ek parivaar ke sadsy se
 Director Imtiaz Ali has made many successful films
 bataur nirdeshak apana bada mukaam bhi bana chuke hai, magar 'hive' kii kahani main vah chook gaye
 He may want to tell from his story that not only do bad things on the streets or small people, but also in the homes of the rich
 khaastaur se ladkiyaan kahin bhi surakshit nahin
 If Imtiaz has made a film with this thinking, then the thinking is good, but he could not weave the story of its story with regret

 Former Congress president and UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi has criticized efforts to amend the RTI Act
 unhone modi sarkaar par hamalaa karte hue kaha ki unki manshaa artiai ko kamjor karne kii he
 The central government can use its majority to weaken RTI, but the people of the country will not like it
 mangalvaar ko ek bayaan jari kar sonia gandhi ne kaha, "yah atyant chintaa kaa vishay he ki centre sarkaar aitihaasik soochna ke adhikaar (artiai) adhinium, 2005 ko puri tarah se dhwast karne par amada he
 This law was drafted after advice and passed unanimously by Parliament, the law is now on the verge of being abolished

 Criticizing the government's move, Sonia Gandhi said that over the last 10 years, 60 years of our country men and women have used the Right to Information Act and tried to bring transparency at different levels of administration
 
 sonia ne kaha ki in prayaason kii vajah se hamaara loktantr kaaphi majboot hua he
 He said that the Right to Information activists used this law in a big way, which benefited the poor and marginalized people
 sonia ne kaha, "ye saaf he ki maujuuda centre sarkaar artiai kanoon ko ek baadha samajhati he or kendriya soochna ayukta ke swatantra vajood ko khatm karnaa chaahati he, jise is kanoon main mukhya chunaav ayukta or kendriya satarkta ayukta ke baraabar darja diya gaya tha
 The central government can use its majority in the House to achieve this objective, but in the process it will weaken every citizen of the country
 "haalanki centre ne somvaar ko vipaksh kii in shankaaon ko khaarij karte hue kaha tha ki sarkaar soochna ke adhikaar kanoon kii swaittata or isaki paardarshita kaa banaaye rakhane ko lekar patibaddh he

 dilli main sardiyon kii shuruyaat se kuch din pehle hipradooshabadhana shuru ho jaataa he or usee daurandashahraor diwali jaise bade tyohaar bhi aate hai
 In such a situation, the Delhi High Court has asked the Center and the Government of Delhi to prepare a report on the pollution caused by effigies of Ravana burning during Dussehra
 pehle hi pradooshan kii maar jhel rahi dilli main diwali or dashahara ke dauraan pataakhon se hone vaala pradooshan aag main ghi kaa kaam karata he
 This is the reason that the Delhi High Court has directed the Delhi Government and the Central Government to form a committee to decide how to control the pollution during winter festivals during three to four months
 dilli hoicourt vaayu pradooshan se judi us yachika par sunwaayee kar rahaa he jisamen rajya main lagaataar bad rahe pradooshan ko lekar sarkaar or agency se niyantran kii maang kii gai he
 In the hearing on Monday also, the petitioner told the court that about ten thousand effigies of Ravana are burnt in Delhi during Dussehra itself
 putalonmen badi sankhya main pataakhe bhi hote hai jisase dashahara ke dauraan dilli main pradooshan kaa str or bad jaataa he
 Concerned about the government seeking a permanent solution, the High Court told the petitioner that it is Dussehra only after 2 days, so this year the court is unable to do anything, but before next year's Dussehra, both the central and state governments should come together to find a permanent solution
 Will happen
 ab dilli or centre sarkaar ko 22 november se pehle ek cameti kaa gathan karnaa hoga jiskaa kaam yah tay karnaa hoga ki tyoharon ke dauraan pataakhon ke alaava or koun-koun se mukhya kaaran he jisasepradooshnaur bad rahaa he
 Also how can those reasons be reduced
 is par bhi cameti ko guidelins banani hongi
 The High Court made it clear that the order of the Supreme Court of last year would still have to be implemented by the Delhi Government and all the agencies which have a provision to ban the sale of firecrackers
 pradooshan ko maapne vaali tamaam agenciyon ke data bhi is baat kii pukhta pushti kar chuke hai ki dashahra or diwali ke dauraan pataakhon ke istemaal se dilli main pradooshan kaa str kai guna zyada bad jaataa he

 punjab neshnal bank ke kareeb gyaarah hajaar karod doobane ke baad bhi rashtriyakrutbainkonne abhi koi sabak nahin liya he
 a similar case is waiting in Kanpur city, which is considered to be a business hub in Uttar Pradesh
 kanpur ke vyapaaree vikram kothaari par aarope he ki unpar paanch rashtriya bainkon kii kareeb 3000 karod kii dendaree he or kothaari ne is udhari kaa koi bhi paisa nahin waapas kiya
 Despite this, not only are the Kothari openly roaming, but their businesses are also running badly
 mumbai ke neerav modi se thodaa alag vikram kothaari par aarope he ki inhone bank ke aalaa adhikariyon ke saath mili bhagat karke apni sampattiyon kii keemat zyada dikhaakar unpar karodon kaa lone liya or phir unhen chuktaa karne se mukar gayi
 Vikram Kothari is the owner of Rotomac Pence and lives in a luxurious bungalow in the posh Tilak Nagar area of kanpur
 vikram kothaari ne 2012 main apni company rotomac ke naam par sabase pehle ilahabaad bank se 375 karod kaa lone liya tha
 After this, took a loan of 432 crores from Union Bank
 itnaa hi nahin vikram kothaari ne indian oversij bank se 1400 karod, bank of india se lagbhag 1300 karod or bank of baroda se 600 karod rupee kaa lone liya, lekin kisi bank kaa lone chuktaa nahin kiya
 It is alleged that Vikram Kothari sat down with the banks by paying nearly three thousand crores rupees due to the devotion of the bank officials
 unki rotomac company par bhi taala lag gaya
 Banks declared all accounts of Vikram Kothari as all npas
 aaropo ke bare main hamane vikram kothaari ke ghar par baat karne kii koshish kii
 But nobody agreed to talk anywhere at home and office
 kanpur main jab hamane union bank ke manager pike avasthi se baat kii to unhone bataaya ki hamaari bank kaa 482 karod rupee vikram kothaari par baaki hai
 He took this loan of ours in 2012
 ab unka khaataa enpie ho gaya he
 We are trying to recover from them
 vaise unke upar kanpur kii chaar bainko kaa lagbhag teen hajaar karod ke lagbhag lone bakaayaa he, jo enpie ho gaya he
 When the banks opened their eyes on this scam, they avoided the matter by giving information in their main offices
 lambaa bakt bitne ke baad bhi abhi tak bainko ne koi aisa thos kadam nahin uthaaya, jisase ki kothaari par shikanja ksaa ja sake
 According to sources, some cases of loans are definitely going on in the mediation, due to which the bank has attached the land of Kothari and recovered the loan of hundred crores
 vikram kothaari ke upar lone kii evaj main jaahir rup se itani sampatti nahin he ki jisase puraa lone chuktaa ho sake
 It is clear that crores of rupees are going to be drowned by the nexus of bank officials and fraudsters once again
 hairaani kii baat ye he ki lambey samay tak vikram kothaari ko bank karodon rupee dete rahe
 No one has done a thorough investigation about Kothari
 aarope he ki ye paisa kothaari ne desh videsh kii kuch companiyon or property kii kharid main lagaaya he

 The strike has started in 274 grain mandis of Rajasthan against the government's direct purchase from farmers and selling goods in the market
 vyapaariyon ne rajya kii sabhi anaaj mandiyon ko band kar virodh pradarshan shuru diya he or aarope lagaaya he ki sarkaar dwaara zyadasamarthan mulyaparfasalkharidakar kam daam par bazaar main bechney kii vajah se mandi main vyapaariyon ke paas koi nahin aa rahaa he
 President of the Rajasthan Food Merchants Association, Babulal Gupta said that the government wants to stop the work of the adhatiyas, with which more than 25 lakh people are connected in almost the entire Rajasthan
 kisaanon se sidhe fasal kharidne kii vajah se kisaan mandi main nahin aa rahe hai or afasar kisaanon ke saath jyaadati kar rahe hai
 The officers, together with the contractors, are buying crops from outside, instead of mandis, where there is rampant corruption
 kam se kam agar kisaan mandi main fasal laaenge or vahaan par sarkaar kharidegi, isse vyapaaree or kisaan donon kaa phayda hoga
 But there is a corruption game outside the market to buy and sell grains at the support price
 masalan mung kii fasal sarkaar 52 rupye prati kilo ke samarthan mulya par kharid rahi he or bazaar main 44 rupee prati kilo ke hisaab se bech rahi he
 In such a situation, if the farmer buys a peanut crop at Rs 47 per kg, then where will he sell it
 is tarah se anaaj vyapaariyon kaa puraa vyavsaay hi khatm ho rahaa he
 Traders in the mandis of Rajasthan have stopped work since Saturday and have warned the government that if the mandi system is not rectified, the traders will go against the BJP in the coming elections
 vyapaariyon ne aarope lagaaya ki rajasthan hi ek aisa rajya he jahaan vyapaariyon se mandi shulk vasula jaataa he
 Also 0 on business on oilseeds and on groundnut

 This is hurting traders
 vyapaariyon ne maang kii he ki jiesti main 5 karod se upar kaa vyavsaay karne vaale vyapaariyon ko bhi 3 maheene ke andar tex bharne kii seemaa par chhot di jaae kyonki anaaj ke kaarobaar main phayda kam hota he or turnover zyada kaa hota he

 New Delhi: a discussion was held under the chairmanship of Murali Manohar Prasad Singh on Kamalakant Tripathi's historical-cultural novel 'saryu to Ganga' published by the book house in the Rabindra Bhavan auditorium of Sahitya Academy
 paricharchaa main pro
 Nityananda Tiwari was present as the chief guest and the famous narrator Sanjeev introduced the theme
 karn singh chouhan, asgar vajahat, kailash narayan tiwari, bali singh, sanjeev kumaar, rakesh tiwari evam amit dharm singh ne paricharchaa main vaktaa ke rup main bhaag liya
 Abhishek Shukla handled the debate efficiently
 vishay-pravartan karte hue kathakaar sanjeev ne sarayu se ganga ko itihaas evam saamaajik jivan ke vistrut falak par likhi gai ek vrihad or mahatvapurn aupnyasik kriti bataaya
 In the backdrop of the process of Panipat, Plassey, Buxar, the decline of the Mughal Empire, the continuous expansion of the dominance of the East India Company, and the process of unification of Nepal, he described malagujari, contracting, talukdari, farming and farming at the center of the novel
 upanyaas kii deshaj bhashaa ke soundarya ko rekhaankit karte hue unhone kaha ki puraa upanyaas avadhi kii chhaunk se sugandhit he
 Amit Dharam Singh, the second speaker, saw the novel by dividing it into three different contexts of history, society and life
 atharahavin sadi ke uttarardh main company ke prabhutv main vistaar ke saath kisaan riaya kii takalifon, lagaan kii maar se uske shoshan tathaa stri jivan kii vidmbana ko unhone vartmaan paridrishy ke liye praasangik bataaya
 Talking on the life aspect, he saw the power of the human mind and the attainment of the mind in the novel by realizing the meaningful hindu-muslim unity in the novel
 tisare vaktaa patrkaar evam lekhak rakesh tiwari ne upanyaas main dharmik aadambar ke rup main mahamrityunjay jap ke prasang kaa zikr karte hue, lekhak ko aise aadambaron ke viruddh khadey dekha
 He targeted the socio-political transition of the eighteenth century and the importance of shared-cultural development through characters such as Lekhipathi, Jamil and Razzaq
 rakesh ne sarayu se ganga ko multah gramin kisaan or majdoor varg kaa upanyaas bataaya
 The poet and critic Bali Singh saw the geographical and natural landscape of the then village, farmer, field, crop, forest, river, etc
 being sculpted on the wide pane of the novel
 is sandarbh main unhone lekhak kii paini evam pramanik drushti ke saamne google ko aksham paaya
 He said, the novel is written in a dramatic style in which a character named history plays the role of narrator
 nawabon or company ke bich kii sandhi se kisaan ko kuch lenaa-dena nahin he kintu vah uske aadhaar par hone vaale shoshan kaa sabase bada shikaar banataa he
 He claimed that in today's era of globalization, a similar treaty takes place between the government and the capitalist, whose brunt of the peasantry has to suffer in the form of unemployment, starvation and suicide
 upanyaas kaa mukhya paatr lekhipati mileebhagat kii is jakad se nikalne ke liye sangharsh karata dikhaai padataa he
 The novel embodies the consciousness of democratic integration and the message of a nation state that was limited to religious, cultural myths, but which had no physical existence
 agle vaktaa aalochana patrika ke sampadak sanjeev kumaar the
 He took notice of two bright sides of the novel - secularism and public advocacy
 lekhipati, jameel or rajjak jaise paatr dharm kaa atikaraman kar ekajute hote hai or company ke upar nawab kii nibharrata se samaaj main jo bhayanak, arajak or shoshak sthiti paidaa hoti he uske viruddh safal sangharsh karte hai
 The next speaker was Kailash Narayan Tiwari, a professor and author of Delhi University
 unhone lekhkeey swaittata or swatantraaa kaa mudda uthaate hue kaha ki kamalaakanth ne apane is upanyaas main itihaas ke vrihattar falak ke daayre main lekhipati, jameel, rajjak, savitri jaise paatro kii paristhitiyon ke anuroop unke manobhaavon or sookshm samvednaa kaa jo unmukt khaakaa khinchaa he or jis tarah parivaar, gaanv, ghar ke aapasi sambandhon kaa maanviya rup prastut kiya he, use padhate hue premachand ke godaan main gunthi do samaantar kathaon kii yaad aati he
 In the novel, the hindu-muslim relationship is depicted on a purely human level beyond religion, which is filled with subtle sensations
 karn singh chouhan kaa kahana tha ki koi bhi kriti hamaare saamne samvaad ke liye hoti he or yah upanyaas hamaare saamne dheron samvaad prastut karata he
 This novel, distinct from the identities prevalent under current fashion, is a soulful mirror of spontaneous, human Indian sentiment in which the ground reality of society is reflected
 desh main swatantra gramin ikai kii jo swasth or samyak vyavastha hajaaron saal se chali aa rahi thi
 The British broke him in one stroke and with that he destroyed the excellent products of society, culture and production
 upanyaas ne stri-samvednaa ke pahalu ko apratim sookshmata or moulikta se chuaa he
 In the end, he concluded that novels of such excellent quality are few and long after
 prasiddh naatakkaar-kathakar asgar vajahat ne bataaya ki upanyaas bhoot, vartmaan or bhavishya main vicharan karte hue avadh pradesh kii saamanti vyavastha ke upanideshvaadi vyavastha main antaran kii katha kahata he
 In the novel, we see religion in a society different from the meaning that is prevailing in today's society
 mukhya atithi pro
 Nityananda Tiwari said that the novel properly elevates the stream of history
 uski antamagatishiltaa or chrysis kii dhar ko kunthit nahin karata
 The fear prevails in the society then, every character of the novel is in its grip
 us dar or uske peeche kii amanviyata se satat ladata hua dikhaai padataa he jo aaj ke paridrishy ke liye behad praasangik he
 The novel presents the form of hindu-muslim shared society found in Jayasi's Padmavat
 apane adhyakshiya vaktavy main murali manohar prasad singh ne upanyaas ko itihaas kii prakriya se upje us sankat ke marm ko kholane vaala bataaya
 In which the British, who came as traders, occupy the state power
 itihaaskaar raichoudhary kaa hawala dete hue unhone kaha ki is upanyaas main unnisvin shatabdi ke upanyaason kii tarah kahin bhi muslim purush or mahila paatro ko maanav charitra kii buraai kii pratik ke rup main nahin dikhaaya gaya he
 This work will be known as an important novel work of this century due to highlighting the bright side of the municipality that transcends religion

 He said, the government is planning to introduce a cab aggregator platform where passengers can choose the mode of transportation to their liking
 jaise- four-whealer taxi yaa tu-whealer
 Here the government will act as a platform but this platform will increase the competition in the market and provide public transport to the passengers at an affordable price

 na keval pallaa jhaada he balki bahut tikhe andaaj main spasht kiya he ki ve aisa kabhi nahi kar sakate
 Ajit Jogi, considering the eight religious texts as spot-nazir, vowed that he would neither support nor seek BJP support under any circumstances
 ajit jogi ne kasam khate hue kaha, “chaahe mujhe suuli par chadha den, main mrityu pasand karunga, lekin bijepi ke samarthan main nahi aauungaa
 "former Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Ajit Jogi has had to come to the media with all religious texts in his bungalow
 unki teble par ramayana, gita, hanuman chalisa, sundarkand, durga saptshati se lekar quran, bible, guru granth sahab rakhaa gaya
 All these holy books adorned the table not for worship and chanting but for swearing
 sapane main nahin soch saktaa ki bijepi se gathbandhan karunmamala hi kuch aisa hua he ki jogi ko har ek dharm samudaay ke logon ko bharosa dilaanaa pad rahaa he ki wo kisi bhi haal main bijepi ke camel ko apane haathon main nahin thamenge
 Jogi has to swear by considering these texts as spot-nazir
 kasam khate hue wo yah bhi kah rahe he ki main sapane main nahin soch saktaa ki main bijepi se gathbandhan karu
 In fact, his statement to former Chief Minister of Chhattisgarh and founder of Janata Congress has been overshadowed
 ek sabha main ajit jogi ne elaan kar diya tha ki yadi jarurat padi to wo bijepi ke saath ja sakate hai
 Jogi's statement with the BJP has shocked many leaders and supporters of the Janata Dal Congress
 ajit jogi ke is bayaan se rajnatik galiyara to garma gaya
 The BJP was stunned by this statement, but the Congress immediately opened a front against the Jogi Congress
 usne jogi ke is sameekaran ko janata tak pahunchane main koi kasar baaki nahin chodi
 The Congress argued from village to village that when Jogi likes to go with BJP, why vote for him? The bjp's Khilafat voters who were looking at Ajit Jogi's party with hopeful eyes started turning away from Jogi's party
 congress ko fouran jogi congress or bijepi par hamalaa karne kaa mauka mil gaya
 Jogi had earlier announced to contest the election against Chief Minister Raman Singh, but when the turn came to fill the nomination, he was overturned by his promise
 unhone rajanandgaanv vidhansabha seat ke bajaaye marvaahee vidhansabha seat se namakan daakhil kiya or chunavi maidan main utar gaye
 Jogi had also announced to contest against Chief Minister Raman Singh in the 2013 assembly elections but refused to contest when the turn came for filing nominations
 ab jogi ne bijepi ke saath gathbandhan kii baat kar ek baar phir you turn le liya he
 Ajit Jogi claimed that his alliance with BSP is in a very strong position

 captain andrew strans or elistare cook kii umdaa ballebaaji ke baad bharat or england ke bich khele ja rahe chauthe or antim cricket test ke pehle din barish ne khalal daalaa
 Strauss and Cook's opening pair led the hosts to 75 runs without losing wickets till lunch, after which it started to rain during the break and the game could not resume
 barish ruk-rukkar hoti rahi, jiske kaaran ampiron ne kai baar maidan kaa nirikshan kiya, lekin antat: din kaa khel radd karne kaa faisla kiya
 Only 26 overs could be played on the first day
 strans ab tak 74 gend main paanch chaukon kii madad se 38 ran bana chuke hai, jabaki cook ne 82 gend kaa saamana karte hue chaar chaukon kii madad se 34 ran banaae hai
 India are trailing 0–3 in the series after heavy defeats at Lords, Trentbridge and Edgbaston and have won the match with the goal of saving their reputation
 team ko haalanki match kii shuruyaat se pehle hi karaara jhatka laga, jab siries main uske sabase safal gendbaaj praveen kumaar edbeston main tisare test main baayen takhne main lagi chot se nahin ubar paae or is match se baahar ho gaye
 He was replaced by fast bowler RP Singh in the playing XI, who is returning to Test cricket after more than three years
 england ke captain strans ne ballebaaji kii anukool pich par toss jitkar pehle ballebaaji karne kaa faisla kiya or edbeston main pichley test main 294 ran kii pari khilne vaale cook ke saath milakar mejabaan team ko acchhee shuruyaat dilaai
 India's bowlers once again had to struggle against the batsmen of the host team
 bhartiya captain mahendra singh dhoni ne dakshin africa ke khilaaf ahmedabad main april, 2008 main apana pichhlaa test khilne vaale arapy singh or ishanth sharma se gendbaaji kii shuruyaat karai, lekin in donon hi gendbaajon ne niraash kiya
 Fast bowler Sreesanth also failed to meet expectations
 strans ne unhen vishesh rup se nishaanaa banaaya or un par teen chauke maare
 However, the batsmen of the host team could not play the shot openly and the team bowlers kept the run pace at bay
 mehmaan team ke gendbaajon ko lekin koi safalataa nahin mili, jisase england kii shuru main wicket bachaane kii ranneeti safal rahi
 However, it started raining during lunch, after which the game could not be started again, which would surely have disappointed the England team
 isse pehle england ne edbeston main bharat ko pari or 242 ran se haraane vaali team main koi badlaav nahin kiya

 raashtrapati donald trump ne sthitiyon main sudhaar na hone par america ko vishwa vyapaar sanghathan se baahar nikaalane kii dhamkee di he
 Trump said Tuesday while addressing workers at a shale chemical plant in Pennsylvania that we will do this
 asal main, america ne vishwa vyapaar sanghathan (dablutio) main china kaa vikasshil raashtra kaa darja usase waapas lene kii chetavanee di he jise china ne america kaa ghamand or uskaa swaartheepan qaraar diya he
 However, Trump said, "we know that they (china) have been messing with us for years and this is not going to happen again
" ' trump ne dablutio ko uske pichley kai kadamon kaa zikr karte hue us par nishaanaa saadhaa he or america ko dablutio se baahar nikaalane kii dhamkee di he
 He claimed that the WTO was misbehaving with the US and said that the WTO cannot ignore Washington
 trump ne kaha ki sanghathan main shaamil kiye jane ke vakt china ko pradaan kii gai sharton ko lekar america kii shikaayat he
 He said the US had made complaints about China's theft of American technology
 lekin sanyukt rajya america ke paas vastav main vaishvik vyapaarik sanstha dwaara madhyasthata se vivaadon ko jeetne kaa ek safal record he
 Trump claims that the Trump administration effectively softened its stand whenever asked to improve the rules of the institution

 As a result, some members of the WTO are taking advantage
 mana ja rahaa he ki yah nirdesh china ko dhyaan main rakhkar diya gaya he
 Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said at a regular press conference that this demand from the Trump administration reflects his 'arrogance' and 'selfishness'
 unhone kaha ki ek yaa kuch deshon ko yah nirnay karne kaa adhikaar nahin hona chahie ki kisi desh ko vikasshil deshon kii shrenee main rakhana he or kise nahin
 Significantly, the WTO gives a long timeframe for the respective governments to fulfill free trade commitments by getting the status of a developing country in the WTO, as well as allowing such countries to protect some of their domestic industries and to continue state aid

 ab hamaari maang ek he or ham saath ladenge’
