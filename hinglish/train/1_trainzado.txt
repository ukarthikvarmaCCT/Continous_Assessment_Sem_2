do saal baad khuli dilli ke ek parivaar kii murder mistry
 The case was closed by UP police after revealing honor killing
 magar sirf ek suraag ne kar diya shaatir qaatilon kaa bhandaphod
 Those who were told by the UP Police that the murderers were actually the victims upi police kii aisi taftish se to kisi ko bhagwaan hi bachaae
 Two years ago, when this family of Delhi's Wazirabad suddenly disappeared somewhere in a mysterious way, everyone was surprised
 hairaani ye ki akhir kisi ko bataae bagair ek saath ek hi parivaar ke chaar log achaanak kahaan chale gaye? lekin jab ek rose baad hi is parivaar kii ladki kii laash uski car samet hapur ke is nahar se baraamad hui, to bahut se logon ko yahi laga ki shaayad apni beti kii jaan lene ke baad ye parivaar kahin gaayab ho gaya he
 That is, the case of honor killing
 lekin agar ye galati aam logon se hoti, to bhi samajhi ja sakati thi
 But look at the innocence of the UP police that he too believed blindly on this theory of common people
 or ye kehete hue adaalat main chargeshit daakhil kar di ki parivaar ne khud hi apni beti kii jaan lene ke baad usee nahar main kud kar jaan de di
 It is another matter that since then till today, except for a daughter, the body of this member and any member of the family has not been caught by the police
 01 november 2018magar, ab achaanak itane dinon ke baad dilli police kii krime branch saamne aati he
 And the theory of Honor Killing of the death of four people completely reverses saying that not only is the case of Honor Killing, but the three boys from Delhi also did not pay the money taken from Ved Prakash, the head of the family
 Simultaneously his family was killed
 yani maamla honor kiling or phir khudakushi kaa nahin, balki sidhaa-sidhaa chaar logon ke qatl kaa tha
 Now the question arises that after all how did this great mistake in solving a serious matter with the UP Police? Is it not that the UP police deliberately gave the case to honor killings and the rest of the people to save the killers? After all, why were the three killers of this case not caught in front of everyone's eyes for so many days? Why has no one doubted the gesture of these murderers yet? So when the crime branch of Delhi Police carried out the investigation, most of these questions were also answered
 krime branch kii maane to usne is maamle main mukhya aaropee yani veda prakaash se udhaar main rupee lene vaale or uske qatl kii saazish rachane vaale abhishek ko giraftaar kar liya he, jabaki is chaar qatl ke baaki do aropiyon main se ek kii sadak haadase main maut ho chuki he, jabaki teesraa bhi ab zindaa nahin he

 pakistan ke pradhanmantri navaj sharif ke kathith taur par bhartiya pradhanmantri manmohan singh ko dehati aurat kahe jane par desh main rajnatik maahaul garma gaya he
 But according to Pakistani journalists, Nawaz Sharif did not call India's PM a pastoral woman
 sharif ne to ek kissa sunaakar yah kaha tha ki bharat pakistan ko apane jhagadon yaa aapasi muddon par america ke paas nahin janaa chahie
 The Pakistani journalist, Nawaz Sharif, had a story like this
 ek gaanv main ek kamare main kai purush so rahe the
 Then one of them sat up and started praying in remembrance of Allah
 kuch der baad vah kehane laga ki dekho baaki sab so rahe hai, jabaki main jaag chukaa hum or ibaadat main laga hum
 Then another man sleeping in the room woke up and said to the first man that you should confine your prayers to yourself and do not complain about others
 pakistani channel aaj tivi ke ankar absaar alam ke mutabik navaj ne yah kissa sunaate hue kaha tha ki pakistan ke punjab ke kisi aise masale par, jisase india ke hit jude hon, obama se charchaa karnaa kitna munasib he
 Alam was referring to the Jamaat-ud Dawa, a terrorist organization, which is being funded by the Punjab government of Shahbaz Sharif, the younger brother of Nawaz Sharif
 hamid mir ne kaha tha dehati auratis puure rajanyik sankat kii shuruyaat tab hui thi jab pakistan ke tivi channel jeeyo ke hamid mir ne navaj sharif ke hawaale se kaha tha ki bhartiya pradhanmantri us dehati aurat kii tarah bartaav kar rahe hai, jo har cheez ke liye ishwar se madad maangati he
 When the Indian side's resentment began to emerge after Mir's disclosure, he wrote on Twitter that the Pakistan Prime Minister did not make any derogatory remarks to his Indian counterpart
 hamid mir ke mutabik navaj sharif yah kahana chaahate the ki agar bharat ko pakistan ke saath koi dikkat he, to donon mulk is bare main aapas main baat kar sakate hai
 What does it mean to present such issues to US President Barack Obama? bakaul mir, navaj ne ye baat halke phulke andaaj main kahi thi or usee mizaaj ko dhyaan main rakhte hue maine tivi par ye dehati aurat vaali baat kah di
 Sharif did not use such a word
 jab sharif ko patrakaron ke saath naashte par hui meeting ke baad unke bayaan par mache bavaal kaa pataa chalaa, to unhone fouran isaki bharpai shuru kar di
 Pakistan's foreign secretary Jalil Abbas Jilani was entrusted with the task
 sutron ke mutabik jilani ne pradhanmantri ke saath america daure par pahunche bharat ke rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar shivashankar menon se sampark kiya or yah saaf kiya ki navaj sharif ne manmohan singh ke liye koi bhi galat tippanee nahin kii he
 But here in India, the political agitation intensified when this remark was cited by bjp's Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi at a political rally in Delhi on Sunday
 modi ne kaha ki navaj sharif kii aukaat hi kya he, jo vah bharat ke pradhanmantri ke liye is tarah ke apmanjanak lahaze kaa istemaal karen
 The SP does not want to take any risk in the Mainpuri Lok Sabha seat vacated by the resignation of Samajwadi Party national president Mulayam Singh Yadav

 The party leadership is considering contesting Ram Gopal

 This time he won elections from Mainpuri as well as Azamgarh
 haalanki mainpuri main unki badi jeet hui or azamgarh main halki lekin siyaasi majaburiyon ke chalate unhen mainpuri seat chhodmai padi
 Even after Mulayam leaves the party, the party wants to retain its hold on this seat
 is seat par upachunaav ke liye abhi tak tej pratap singh urf teju yadav ko chunaav ladaane kii charchaa thi
 Teju is the grandson of Mulayam Singh's late elder brother
 vah saifai ke block pramukh bhi hai
 The party leadership feels that Teju's stature is yet to fill the seat vacated by Mulayam Singh Yadav's resignation
 aise main ramgopal yadav ko chunaav ladaane par gambhirtha se vichaar kiya ja rahaa he
 Ram Gopal Yadav is currently the leader of the SP in the Rajya Sabha
 unka kaarykaal 25 november ko khatm ho rahaa he
 The SP can easily send him to the Rajya Sabha, but it seems more right to contest the Lok Sabha by-election

 ek research ke mutabik karmchaaree kaam ke dauraan soshal media kaa istemaal kai vajahon se karte hai
 One of the biggest and most common reasons is that they want to take a break from work for a while and refresh themselves

 maharashtra main sarkaar gathan ko lekar halchal tejashivasena-ensipi-congress main ban sakati he batek CM, do dipti siem ke formule par charchavidhansabha chunaav ke nateezon ke baad se hi maharashtra apni nai rajya sarkaar ke intjaar main he
 President's rule has been imposed but the political commotion is increasing
 bhaajapa kaa saath chhodane vaali shivasena ab congress or ensipi ke saath jaati hui dikh rahi he or teenon partiyon main sarkaar gathan ke liye saajha kaarykram par baat banati bhi dikh rahi he, lekin abhi bhi do mudde aise hai jisapar baat ataki hui he or vistaar se charchaa hona baaki he
 The Shiv Sena's talk of creating a minimum common program with the ncp-congress in Maharashtra seems to be stuck on two issues
 
 
 1
 Shiv Sena demands that Veer Savarkar get Bharat Ratna 2
 congress-ensipi kii maang he ki muslimon ko 5 fisadi aarakshan milagoratlab he ki shivasena puri tarah se hindutv kii raajnneeti karti he, lekin congress-ensipi ke saath kuch tyaag karnaa pad rahaa he
 Assembly elections or Lok Sabha elections, the Shiv Sena has consistently demanded Bharat Ratna for Veer Savarkar
 lekin congress-ensipi lagaataar vir saavarkar ko ek vivaadaaspad kirdaar maanati rahi hai or unka naam mahatma gandhi kii hatya kii sajeesh karne waalon ke saath jodatii ai he
 On the other hand, if talking about Muslim reservation, Shiv Sena has been opposing this issue and has been promoting Maratha reservation in the state
 aise main ab is baat par bhi har kisi kii nazar rahegi ki jin masalon par baat atak rahi he vah kaise puure hote hai or koun apane daawey kii qurbaani detaa he
 Government can be formed with this formula! Let us know that a formula has come out on Friday only on which the Shiv sena-ncp and Congress government can be formed
 iske tahat shivasena kopanch saal ke liye mukhyamantri pad mil saktaa he, vahiin ensipi-congress ko dipti siem kaa pad mil saktaa he
 Apart from this, the minister's post may be divided by the formula of 14-14-12
 maharashtra main bani baat! shivasena kaa hi hoga CM, 14-14-12 ke formule par honge mantri In Rewa, Madhya Pradesh, due to blind faith and superstition, a girl cut off her tongue in her own hands
 jeebh katane ke baad ladki 5 ghante tak behosh padi rahi or bhakt devi bhajan or puja archana karne main jute rahe
 In the Devi temple, this case of Rewa Kerani Talab Mandir, which shocked the girl by cutting the tongue
 anitha dvivedi naam kii yuvati buudhvaar ko devi darshan ke liye yahaan ai or puja archana ke baad blade se jeebh katkar devi ko chadha di, jeebh kaatane ke turant baad anitha behosh ho gai
 In a hurry, the priest informed the family members of Anita, but instead of calling the doctor or police, asked the people present there to do bhajan
 5 ghante tak ladki padi rahi behoshis puure ghatnakram ke dauraan anitha lagbhag paanch ghante tak mandir main hi behosh padi rahi
 Now Anita bit her tongue in her own hands, no one knows at the moment
 lekin kareeb paanch ghante takabehoshpade rahane ke baad anitha apane parivaar waalon ke saath ghar chali gai
 This game of faith continued in the Devi temple for about five and a half hours and the health department and the police sat hand in hand
 police bhi is aasthaa ke prati laachaar najar ai
 Even before the temple has been climbed, in this Devi temple of Tongriva, devotees often offer tongues with their beliefs
 logon ko maananaa he ki yahaan jeebh chadhaane se unki icchhaaen puri hoti he
 Even before this, in Navratri and other festivals, devotees offer their tongues to the Mother Goddess and all the blind nadars come in front of the devotees with this blind faith or rather passion

 sarkaar dasvin board kii parikshaon ko phir se shuru karne ke mood main he
 The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), the country's largest examination conducting organization, has been informed in this regard
 maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantri prakaash jaavdekar 25 oktober ko isaki aadhikarik ghoshnaa karenge
 This is his first major announcement since becoming a minister
 dasvin board kii parikshaayen saal 2018 se shuru honi sambhavit hai
 No Detention up to fifth class
 
 
 ve iske alaava paanchavin tak ke students ke liye 'no ditension' policy bhi ghoshit karenge
 States will be able to implement it up to class VIII at their convenience
 haalanki unhen is bich fail hone vaale students ko agali class main pramot karne ke liye dobaaraa parikshaayen karaani hongi
 It is to be noted that in 2010, the boarding facility was started on year-end basis by eliminating board exams
 iske peeche tark tha ki grading system students par dabaav kam karegaa
 Behind these board exams were the reactions from the state and the parents of the children
 ve kehete hai ki in board parikshaon ke nahin karaae jane kii vajah se padhai kaa str gira he
 However, if the research conducted during this period, the results indicate a drop out
 aage kii taiyaari ke liye bataaya jaruri
 
 
 Advocates in favor of the tenth board examinations consider it important for preparing for further board examinations
 chaatro ko na rokane kii policy neshikshakon ke adhikaronmen bhi katautee kii he
 Meanwhile, in the eleventh class, many students failed, so the demand for the tenth board examinations started picking up even more rapidly
 maanav sansaadhan mantralay apane is kadam ko shiksha ke kshetra main diwali kaa uphaar kah rahi he
 He will make the final announcement following meetings with education ministers of different states and the Central Advisory Board of Education (CABE)
 saath hi ve kehete hai ki sarkaar or board ke is kadam se apekshit pareenam nahin mili hai
 There is no NCERT to prevent dropouts
 Today, even though the formula of 'no Detention' seems complicated, it is a matter of the state that they want to stop students failing in classes five, six, seven and eight in the same class again
 Huh
 haalanki 'dubaara pariksha' ko ve anivaary banaaenge
 The same NCERT is also against the removal of 'no Detention'
 dasvin class kii board parikshaon kii phir se bahaali main vidhayika kaa dakhal nahin chahie, to fail hone par students ko roak lene kii prakriya lagu karne ke liye shiksha kaa adhikaar adhinium ke section 16 main badlaav karne honge
 The Supreme Court has also agreed on the 'no Detention' issue
 gaiyr sahaayta praapt rajasthani privet skool barakes union of india ke cese main supreme court ne kaha he ki claces se nikaalnaa or students ko phir se rokna dropaut dar ko badhayega or is muhim ko dhakka pahonchega

 Actually, they had entered that house too with the intention of stealing but could not succeed in it

 Then at 7 o'clock 1 minute the same Audi car is seen in the CCTV camera

 Highlights of the case against the editor of 'saamana', Owaisi
 
 
 1
 The strength that MIM has gained from the Muslims of Aurangabad will have to be called worrying
 2
 While giving slogans of religion, the vote bank of Muslims became one in the name of religion
 3
 MIM hatched a conspiracy to do dirty politics to split the Dalit votes with Muslim votes
 4
 Some Dalit candidates also came on the ticket of this party
 yadi isi tarah sahanubhuti dikhataa rahaa to saamaajik ekta hi nahin, balki ambedakari andolan ke liye bhi ye khatre kii ghanti sabit ho sakati he
 5

 The report said that the number of youth in India is high and their working capacity is also very high
 vikaas ke lihaaj se bharat ke aane vaale 10 saal behad ahm hai
 How many millionaires? The report said that in the next three years, more than 4 lakh 37 thousand people in India will have assets of more than 6 crore
 or badhat kaa ye silsilaa aage or tej chalane vaala he

 His departure proved to be another major setback for Kapil
 upasna ne krishna abhishek kaa sho join kiya
 Earlier, many artists including Sunil Grover, Navjot Singh Sidhu have left the show
 upasna ne kapil ke sho se dur hone kaa asli kaaran bataaya he
 She told Aaj Tak that she was bored with her character, so she left the show
 ve ab kuch nayaa karnaa chaahati hai
 Upasana Singh told why Kapil Sharma's Shoupasna said, "there was nothing new in my character
" ek hi dialog main sau baar bol rahi thi
 Nothing new was being written for me
 main kuch nayaa karnaa chaahati thi
 There was no scope to pursue my character
 isliye maine kapil ke sho se alag hona hi uchit samajha
 Recently, there were reports that his show is being closed for a few days due to Kapil's illness
 is bare main upasna ne kaha shooting ke dauraan kapil ke health ishyu kabhi saamne nahin aae, unhone teen maheene pehle hi sho chhod diya tha, isliye ve is sab se waakif nahin hai
 Due to these reasons, the dropped graph of the comedy show is Kapil himself and no one is responsible when Upasana asked if she would like to work with Kapil again? Worship said in response, i have nothing wrong with Kapil
 yadi kuch acha likhaa jayega to jarur unke saath kaam karuungi
 i have a good relationship with Kapil

 But worship denies this
 unhone kaha, main siddhu ji ko acchhee tarah jaanati hum, ve kabhi bhi archana ke kaaran sho nahin chhod sakate

 jab unase naam poocha gaya to unhone kaha agar aap is baat par hami bharte hai ki mere naam ujagar karne ke baad bhi mujhe kaam milegaa to aisa karne ke liye taiyaar hum
 i know, there is no special system in the industry so that the victim can get protection

 i think he must have had such experience in private
 jahaan tak bollywood main maujuud mahilaon ke sexual herracement kii baat he mujhe lagata he ki yah puri duniya main maujuud he
 For this reason, the metoo campaign was made the Time Person of the Year
 unhone kaha ki pehle log aise muddon par chup rahaa karte the
 But now we have started raising voice on this
 samay pehle se kaaphi badal gaya he
 Love is a feeling that cannot be told, it can only be felt
 har rishta pyaar or vishwaas par hi tikaa hota he, chahen pati-patni kaa ho yaa girl friend kaa
 But when this love takes the form of over-possessive, it has the potential to ruin your relationship
 haal hi main indian tennis star sania mirza ne ek tivi program 'no filter neha' main bataaya ki jab bhi unke nijee jivan kii baat aati he, to vah asurakshit mahasoos nahin karatin, lekin vah apane rishton ko lekar kaaphi pajesive hai
 What is the effect on over-positive nature actors- jealousy in the relationship and being over-possessive are signs of understanding themselves as inferior
 visheshgyon kii maane to rishte ke shuruaati daur main partner kaa pajesive hona sabko acha lagata he
 But as its level increases, difficulties begin to increase
 - aamtaur par logon kii dharna hoti he ki agar aapkaparterapake din bhar ke bare main choti se choti cheez bhi jaananaa chahta he to vah aapse behad pyaar karata he
 But after some time, you may have a lot of problems with this nature of your partner
 ise samay par nahin pahachaanaa gaya to yah aapke rishte ko barbaad bhi kar sakati he
 Because of being over-positive of partners - the biggest reason for partners to be over-positive is emotional insecurity
 yah insecurity partner ke paas hote hue bhi duuri mahasoos karaati he
 - In any relationship, one partner may feel that the other partner remains alone and is satisfied with himself
 aise main doosarapartenshkela hone ke kaaran asurakshit mahasoos karata he
 Because of this, the partner's feeling of not being close to him turns into over-positive nature
 partnerake ower popeesive nechar kaa aap par asedgar aapkaparterover pajesive he to yah aapke duusare kareebi dost or rishtedaaron ke saath sambandhon ko kharaab kar saktaa he
 For a happy life, you must first know the importance of every relationship
 jarurat se zyada pyaar kai baar rishton main tanaav paidaa kar detaa he
 This causes you to feel suffocated, and your relationships start to break

 "I thought the race will never end," Dhawan, who played for Delhi, said, "I made 7 centuries in domestic cricket, after that i got a chance to play in the Test team
" jab team india ke liye gautam bhai (gambhir) or viru bhai (sahvaag) khel rahe the tab main ranjai kheltaa tha
 i thought this race would never end
 mujhe bas apane khel par dhyaan dete rahanaa chahie or phir meraa samay bhi aayega
 Then by the grace of God, i got a call from Team India
 maine bas apane khel par dhyaan diya or bhavishya main bhi yahi karata rahoonga

 aath saal pehle jis kolhua ke jangal main dadua ko estf ne maar giraaya tha usee jangal main bundelkhand package ko ham khojane nikle
 To save the farmers of Bundelkhand from suicide and drought, the central government gave Rs 7266 crore to 13 districts of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh
 lekin paise kaa bada hissaa netaa or adhikariyon kii jeb main gaya
 To see how much this benefited the farmers, they walked in the forest of Kolhuva from Atra tehsil, about 60 km from Banda
 raste main artiai kaaryakarta or patrkaar ashish sagar ne hamen bataaya ki rasin gaanv main 76 karod rupee kii laagat se rasin baandh banaaya gaya he jiskaa makasad kareeb 5 hazaar acre khet tak sookhe ke halaat main pani pahunchaana he
 This year the monsoon has been negligible
 isliye pehle hamen rasin baandh kaa jayja lenaa chahie
 The dam was completed in 2012
 vidhyanchal pahadiyon kii god main bane is baandh par sinchai vibhaag kaa koi karinda maujuud nahin tha
 The dam was named Rasin Dam after the village of Rasin
 yahaan hamen bhushan naam ke kisaan mili jinaki 12 bighas zamin kaa adhigrahan is baandh ko banane main kiya gaya tha
 Compensation of their land was given at the rate of 24 thousand bighas
 bhushan ne hamen bataaya ki baandh ko bane 3 saal se zyada ho gaya lekin aaj tak is get nahin khulaa
 The canals adjacent to it are lying dry
 yahi nahin is baandh kaa pani aaj tak rasin gaanv ke kheton main nahin pahunchaa
 Seeing the camera, some more villagers came
 hamaari najar khandharnuma bani ek imaarat par thahar gai
 It was told that this is the control room of the dam
 tuuti khidkiyaan-daravaaje ko chor uthaa le gaye the
 Nowadays it remains a seat of stray animals and addicts
 jis baandh kaa control room badahaal ho chukaa he wo sookhe kheton ko kaise haraa karegaa, hamaari samaj main aa chukaa tha
 At some distance from here, we saw two parks
 kisi tarah jaanaleva dhalaan ko parkar ham is park pahunche
 The villagers told that a statue of Gautam Buddha was installed here
 park main bahut khojane par buddha kii pratimaa ke kuch avshesh hamen bhi mili
 Ashish Sagar and Shiva Narayan took photographs with him
 meri samaj main nahin aa rahaa tha ki do karod rupee main aakhir kisaanon ke paise se ye park kyon banawaye gaye
 At first i was considering the white pillars here as cement, but then i saw a pillar falling in the storm
 ye dekhakar hairaan rah gaya ki dur se cement ke dikhne vaale ye khambe fibre ke the or iske andar baaluu or maurang ko bhar diya gaya tha
 Seeing the condition of the park and the dam, i was also sad and angry
 ashish ne bataaya ki ye to trailor he, bundelkhand package kii kahani abhi baaki he
 Walked 30 km from here in the dense forest of Kolhuva
 hamen bataaya gaya ki dadua, thonkia, badkhadia ke maare jane ke baad abhi bubbly naam kaa ek daaku sakriy he
 Hearing this, there was some panic, we left the car in the village and went to see the check dam on the footpath on the footpath
 tippaniyan In the forest of Kolhuva, the forest department has made 55 check dams and each one is worth Rs 5 lakh
 kuch dur aage chalakar kuch pathar rakhkar ek hadabandi dekhne ko mili
 We were told that this is the check dam of five lakhs
 ashish ne bataaya ki yaheen ke adivaasiyon ko bulaakar nadi ke pathar rakh die gaye
 On proceeding from this, the checkdanuma thing was not found
 ashish sagar ne bataaya ki yahaan aakar koi kaam ko check nahin kar saktaa lihaaja kagaji checkdam banaakar paisa dakaar liya gaya
 When we started returning, we met some farmers sitting
 kisaanon ne bataaya ki is saal barish bilkul nahin hui lihaaja halaat kaaphi kharaab hai
 If animals are not there then we die of hunger
 jab badahaal kisaanon ke liye yojanaayen asi ke band kamaron main baithkar bane to usase khushhaal keval adhikari or netaa ho sakate hai
 We had understood this
 bundelkhand ke chaar roza yatra kaa vivaran maine teen bhaag main diya
 If there is a change in the mindset about the politics of the farmer and the package, then we will understand that we are not doing anything for the farmer, but the process of thinking has just started
 kisaanon ko iskaa kitna phayda mila, ye dekhne ke liye banda se kareeb 60 kimi dur atarra tehsil se kolhua ke jangal main chal pade
 On the way, RTI activist and journalist Ashish Sagar told us that Rasin Dam has been built in Rasin village at a cost of Rs 76 crore, which aims to provide water to about 5000 acres of farmland under drought conditions
 is saal monsoon nahin ke baraabar rahaa he
 Therefore first we should take stock of Rasin Dam
 2012 main baandh banakar taiyaar hua
 There was no irrigation department alive on this dam built in the lap of the Vidyachal hills
 rasin gaanv ke naam par is baandh kaa naam rasin baandh rakhaa gaya
 Here we found a farmer named Bhushan whose 12 bighas of land was acquired to build this dam
 inaki jameen kaa muaavja 24 hazaar rupee bighas ke hisaab se mila
 Bhushan told us that it has been more than 3 years since the dam was built but till date this gate has not been opened
 isse lagati naharen sukhi padi he
 Not only this, the water of this dam has not reached the fields of Rasin village till date
 camere ko dekhakar kuch or gaanv vaale aa gaye
 Our eyes stopped on a ruined building
 bataaya gaya ki ye baandh kaa control rum he
 The thieves took the broken windows and doors
 aajkal ye aawaara pashu or nashediyon ke baithne kaa adda bana hua he
 The dam whose control room is in ruins, how it would beat the dry fields, we had understood
 yaheen se kuch duuri par hamen do park dikhaai pade
 Somehow we reached this park after crossing the fatal slope
 gaanv waalon ne bataaya yahaan gautam buddha kii murti lagi thi
 We also found some remains of the Buddha statue after searching a lot in the park
 ashish sagar or shiv narayan ne baqayda use lekar photo khinche
 i could not understand why these parks were built with the money of farmers for two crore rupees
 yahaan lage safed khambon ko pehle main cement kaa maan rahaa tha lekin tabhi meri najar aandhi main gire ek khambe par padi
 It was astonishing to see that these remote looking pillars were of fiber and sand and maurang were filled inside
 park or baandh kii haalat dekhakar mujhe dukh bhi ho rahaa tha or gussa bhi aa rahaa tha
 Ashish told that this is a trailer, the story of the Bundelkhand package is still pending
 yahaan se 30 kimi dur kolhua ke ghaney jangal main chal pade
 We were told that after the killing of Dadua, Thonkia, Badkhadia, a bandit named Babli is still active
 ye sunakar kuch ghabrahat hui, hamane car gaanv main chhod di or paidal patpar pahari naale par bane check dam ko dekhne chal pade
 The comments kolhua ke jangal main jangal vibhaag ne 55 checkdam banaae hai or har ek kii keemat 5 lakh rupee he
 After some distance, a boundary was seen by placing some stones
 hamen bataaya gaya ki paanch lakh kaa check dam yahi he
 Ashish told that the tribals of this place were called and stones of the river were laid
 isse aage badhane par checkdaimanuma cheez bhi nahin mili
 Ashish Sagar told that no one can check the work after coming here, so the money was stolen by making paper check dams
 jab ham lautne lage to kuch kisaan baithe mili
 Farmers told that this year there is no rain at all, so the situation is very bad
 jaanavar agar nahin hon to ham bhukhon mar jaaen
 When plans are made for poor farmers by sitting in closed rooms of AC, then only officers and leaders can be happy
 ye baat hamen samaj aa chuki thi
 i gave the details of four Rosa Yatras of Bundelkhand in three parts
 kisaan or package kii raajnneeti ke bare main thodaa bahut soch main agar badlaav aae to samaj lijiega ki ham kisaan ke liye kuch kar nahin rahe hai bas sochane kii prakriya abhi shuru hui he
 The dam was completed in 2012

 mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne chaaron congressi netaaon ko jediu kii praathmik sadsyta pradaan kii
 In a special conversation with Aaj Tak, Ashok Chaudhary said that since the formation of the new government in Bihar last year, CP Joshi, incharge of the Congress of Bihar was continuously insulting him, after which he was removed from the post of president of Bihar Pradesh Congress
 gauratlab he ki ashok choudhary ke samarthan main party ke teen anya vidhaan parshadon ne bhi party chhodane kaa elaan kiya tha
 Congress legislators who joined JDU also attacked RJD supremo Laloo Prasad Yadav
 unhone kaha ki unki vajah se hi bihar main congress kaa graph nirantar neeche girtaa gaya
 Ashok Chaudhary said that Lalu Prasad Yadav did not allow the Congress to expand in the state even after being aligned with the Congress since 1996
 jab mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne guuruuvaar ko in sabhi congressi netaaon ko jadyu kii sadsyta pradaan kii to is dauraan jadyu ke pradesh adhyaksh vashishtha narayan singh, saansad aaaraseepi singh or anya party ke netaa maujuud rahe

 NEDA allies including bjp's JDU in Bihar are going to meet in Guwahati on Tuesday against the pending Citizenship Amendment Bill, 2016 in the Rajya Sabha, in which these parties can take a major decision to continue the alliance with BJP
 siton ke lihaaj se purvottar ke sabase bade soobe assam main bijepi kii ahm sahyogi assam gana parishad (agypi) pehle hi apana samarthan waapas le chuki he
 The meeting, to be held on Tuesday, is headed by Conrad Sangma, the Chief Minister of Meghalaya and President of the National People's Party (NPP)
 jisamen mizoram main sattadhari mizo neshnal front (MNF), nagaland kii neshnal democratic progressive party (NDPP), tripura kii indiinas pipuls frand of tripura (IPFT), sikkim kii sikkim democratic front (SDF), ke alaava arunachal pradesh, nagaland or manipur se NPP ke netaa shaamil honge
 The BJP had promised to give citizenship to Hindu refugees who came to India in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, playing the Hindu card, suffering persecution from neighboring countries
 bijepi ne apane ghoshnaptr main bhi is vaayade ko shaamil kiya tha
 Its BJP has also been continuously talking of expelling Muslim infiltrators from Bangladesh as a threat to the security of the country
 desh main aagaamee loksabhaa chunaav ke lihaaj purvottar ke rajyon kii 25 siton par bijepi kaa khaas focus he
 At present, out of 25 seats here, BJP has 8 seats, Congress also has 8 seats and rest of the seats are with other regional parties
 bataa den ki inamen se adhiktar kshetreey dal apane-apane rajyon main bijepi ke saath milakar sarkaar chalaa rahe hai
 What is the Citizenship (amendment) Bill 2016? Actually, through the Citizenship Amendment Bill 2016, the government wants to create a new definition of illegal infiltrators
 iske jariye naagarikta adhinium, 1955 main sanshodhan kar pakistan, afghanistan or bangladesh se aae hindu, sikh, buddha, jain, parsi yaa isai samudaay ke avaidh ghuspaithiyon ko bhartiya naagarikta dene kaa praavdhaan he
 However, the Bill does not provide citizenship to Muslim minorities (shias and Ahmadiyas) who are victims of persecution in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh
 iske alawa is vidheyak main 11 saal tak lagaataar bharat main rahane kii shart ko kam karte hue 6 saal karne kaa bhi praavdhaan he
 According to the Citizenship Act, 1955, people entering India without a valid passport or through fake documents are classified as illegal intruders
 kyon ho rahaa he virodh?purvottar ke ye kshetreey dal naagarikta vidheyak ko lekar apana virodh jataa rahe hai
 Because they believe that this bill is tampering with their cultural, social and linguistic identity
 iske alaava is vidheyak ko lekar duusari badi chintaa yah he ki iske lagu hone se rashtriya naagarik register (NRC) ke tahat chinhit kiye gaye avaidh rup se bharat main rah rahe logon ke apadet ko bhi shunya kar degaa

 Top seed Somdev Devvarman overcame difficult conditions to win the first round while the experienced duo of Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi dominated the Commonwealth Games tennis event with a straight set win in the doubles category
 ‘indian express’ ke naam se mashhoor pes or bhupati kii jodi ne ek ghanta or aath minute main srilanka ke thangaraja dineshkantan or amaresh jaivikrame kii jodi ko 6-3, 6-3 se haraakar quarter final main jagah banaai
 The Sri Lankan duo, who have so far failed to make it to the ATP list, had no response to the legendary duo of Paes and Bhupathi, who have won 23 Grand Slam titles
 srilankai jodi ne haalanki bhartiya jodi ko takkar dene kii koshish kii lekin safal nahin ho sake
 The women's doubles pair of Nirupama Sanjeev and Poojashree also reached the final eight with a 6–0, 6–1 win over Aminath Irufa Mahar and Aminath Malila Solih
 isse pehle somdev ne bahamas ke davin malings ko sidhe seton main 6-4, 6-2 se haraakar purush ekal tennis ke pre quarter final main jagah banaakar bharat ko vijayi shuruuaat dilaai
 Malings surprised the home audience by taking a 4–1 lead in the first set but Somdev returned after that to win the set by winning five consecutive games
 baayen haathon ke malings ne apane damdaar forehand se somdev ko shuruuaat main hi pareshaani main daal diya lekin iske baad tej garmi ne bahamas ke khilaadi ko pareshaan karnaa shuru kar diya or mansapeshiyon main khinchaav aane laga
 Malings took a medical time out in the seventh game of the first set and it was from here that the match turned in favor of Somdev
 bahamas ke khilaadi ne iske baad kai sahaj galtiyaan kii
 His two forehands went out which gave Somdev two break points and the Indian player set himself up with a second chance backhand winner
 duusare set main bhi somdev ko malings kii galati kaa phayda mila jab tisare game main unke dabl phalt se bhartiya khilaadi ko brake mila
 The Bahamas player, however, bounced back to get two break points in the sixth game but Somdev saved the first ace and the second with a forehand winner
 somdev ne iske baad ek baar phir malings kii sarvice todakar 5-2 kii badhat banaai or phir doosraa set or match apane naam kar liya
 Whenever we talk about democracy, our attention is only towards the political party and their leaders
 swaabhaavik bhi he
 But you can also see that when the election is over, then who are those people who dare to raise their voice, directly hit the power
 aap paaenge ki press conference main to netaa dikhte hai lekin sadak par tarah-tarah ke aam logon kaa samooh sarkaron or sansthaaon kii takat se loha le rahaa hota he
 Even when disappointed with politics, we do not look at them
 ho saktaa he ki hamen ye lagata ho ki lathi khate shikshakon se hamaara kya lenaa dena, fees vruddhi kii maar sahane vaale maa-baap se hamaara kya lenaa, rojgaar kii maang karne waalon se hamaara kya
 Though you are in all these, but the training to see and think has become such that you do not see anyone outside the party as a leader
 aap bhi or ham log bhi
 We have all agreed that the struggle for democracy comes from the headquarters of political parties
 aaj desh ke tamaam zilon main bina kisi raajnneetik dal ke samarthan ke chote-chote samooh banaakar maa-baap tamaam adhikariyon ko gyaapan de rahe hai
 Not much is being achieved, but their fight is breaking the delusion that these shops opened in the name of private schools are doing everything well
 maa-baap kii majaburi kaa laabh uthaakar skool un par tarah-tarah kii sharten thope rahe hai
 Are forced to live in a kind of mental and economic slavery
 iske kilaaf pradarshan kar rahe maa-baap kaa saath kis dal kaa koun sa netaa de rahaa he? to kya ye log bina kisi netaa kii madad ke apni ladaai nahin lard rahe hai
 Who are these people who are performing in Ludhiana, we never find the possibility of leadership in the parents who perform outside all the schools of Delhi Ghaziabad, Noida
 ham mumbai ke azaad maidan main skulon kii manamaani ke kilaaf anshan par baithe maa-baap main netritv kii sambhaavna nahin khojate
 If there is no leader in political parties, then they start crying about who will run the country
 netaa agar ek minute main chahen to privet skulon kii dhaandhlee band ho sakati he
 If they want, government schools can also be improved, but everyone knows that the ultimate goal is to make notes
 kaam ke naam par utana hi karnaa jisase media main hedline ban jaae ki skool kaa daura ho gaya
 Teacher is grabbed, then questions of thousands of vacant teachers in schools, questions from benches to books are lost somewhere
 aap dekhenge ki hamaari aaj kii raajnneeti vahi kar rahi he jisase whats ap yaa fasebuk main aplod karne ke liye tasviren chhaviyaan paidaa kii ja saken
 So that the work is not as much as it should be; it seems that yes something is happening
 ab to kai maheene biit gaye hai, bilderon par lagaam lagane kaa daawa karne vaale kanoon ko bane hue
 Even after this, why is the performance of those buying flats in Noida Greater Noida going on every Sunday
 kya aapane kisi raajnneetik dal ke netaa ko ravivaar kii dhoop main inke saath pradarshan karte dekha he
 They will not be seen, yes, they will definitely be seen calling in their house, whose picture is much more printed than the people performing in the media
 akhir janata ke khadey kiye hue sangharsh main bina dikhe koi netaa nayak yaa jananaayak kaise ban jaataa he
 Only you make it
 phir bhi taqatvar bilderon ke khilaaf pradarshnon kaa yah silsilaa ummid nahin jagaata he ki koi kitni bhi satta hasil kar le, loktantr ko chin nahin saktaa he
 Who are these people who are taking iron from builders, will think about them sometime
 skool or real estate aisa garh he jahaan netaaon kii jaan basati he
 Through this, people were encouraged
 unki kamai hadpi ja rahi he iske baad bhi thodi-bahut sankhya main hi sahi magar kuch log hai jo awaz uthaa rahe hai
 Looking at these people should be full of expectations
 gaay or mandir se fursat nikaalkar sochiega ki jab janata kaa koi mudda hota he to netaa kahaan hota he
 It is not that the issues of the leader do not belong to the public, but the public does not decide the issues of the leaders
 unka apana tarika hota he
 If the farmers march on foot, two pictures will not be printed, two minutes of footage will not be seen on TV, but if the leaders of the big political party on the farmers do the padyatra, then it will be telecasted for hours and there will be applause that the leader who understands the farmers has come
 yah sab aapke aashirwad se kaayam he
 No outsider but you made it
 ek tasviir he, march 2015 kii, jharkhand kii he
 On a paper, people are eating, they are doing shit
 english main aajkal ise vashroom janaa kehete hai kyonki tailet yaa latrin ab sunne main tatti yaa pakhaana jaisaa bhadda lagata he
 This picture is of the Barwadih block office of Naxalite affected Latehar where people from sixty villages had gathered
 to yah kaagaj par tatti karte hue kya kar rahe hai
 Two years ago, these farmers opposed the Land Acquisition Act
 inkaa lakshya tha ki pradarshnon ko dekhne or dekhakar na dekhne kii hamaari aadat ko gaharaa jhatka lage
 Our colleague Alok Pandey then wrote that the idea did not come from any PR or event management company but was the fundamental thinking of tribal society leaders
 ve bataanaa chaahate the ki bhoomi adhigrahan kanoon main kitna durgandh he
 How much creativity has come in common people's demonstrations and leaders' events
 haalanki donon kii rachanaatmakataa main kaaphi antar he, donon kii naitikta main bhi antar he lekin badlaav to aa hi chukaa he
 Earlier there used to be a padyatra, then that rath yatra, then that roadshow happened and now the roadshow has also changed
 leisure lite se lekar hazaron bikon kaa istamaal hota he
 Everything has started happening as if politics is being filmed at Mehboob Studio in Mumbai
 vahiin par switzaraland he vahiin par england he
 Leaders' performances are now broadcast on TV
 unka camera angel tak badal gaya he taaki aap ke dimag par gaharaa asar ho
 Even the clothes of the poverty alleviators and the leaders who reached the stage with poverty are designers, expensive
 ye sab aapako acha bhi lagata he
 But look at how fast changes are taking place in the leader or organization to come to your TV screen
 kuch saal pehle jab ramlila maidan main din-raat satyagrah chal rahaa tha tab narmada nadi main kuch kisaan jal satyagrah karne utar gaye
 213 people performed for 32 days standing in water across the waist
 unke paanv kharaab ho gaye the
 What are the common people having to do to get the attention of media and government
 ve apni rachanaatmakataa ke zarie is loktantr ko samrudh karte rahe
 Sometimes they win, sometimes they lose
 14 march ko tamilnadu se 134 kisaan dilli aae
 There is a severe drought in Tamil Nadu, no one has seen such a drought in 140 years, but the leaders there are playing the game of power
 kisaan muaavze or karz maafee kii maang ko lekar dilli aae
 We did prime time on March 17, how these farmers, after coming to the Hindi-speaking state, converted their bodies into language
 mushkil se inke bich hindi bolne vaala he
 Even if we could speak Hindi, there is no guarantee that the media and the government would listen
 yah pahalu abhi chhod dijie, dekhie ki in kisaanon ne apane pradarshan ko kis tarah se har din ek nai oonchai di he
 This is a period of creativity in performances
 kisaan nahin ye asli kavi hai
 There is a picture of when they landed at the station
 stesan se utarate hi vahaan choti moti sabha jaisi kar lee
 Instructed everyone where to go and what to do and then left for Jantar Mantar
 ek aise shahar main jahaan inhen us media se bhi hode lenaa tha jisaki praathamiktaayen anya kaarnon se tay hoti rahati hai
 Soon these people started becoming incidents every day
 sabase pehle khud ko ardhangn kiya
 Took a bowl in hand and wrote a bagger on it
 aadhe dhanke tan ke saath ye kisaan karz maafee kii maang karne lage
 There was also a garland of Narmund in his neck
 inkaa kahana tha ki yah khopadi un kisaanon kii he jinhone karz se tang aakar aatmahatya kar lee he
 They have been performing at Jantar Mantar for 40 days
 134 kisaan aae the jinamein se kai biimaar padakar waapas chale gaye magar vahaan se sau kisaanon kaa nayaa jattha jald hi dilli aane vaala he
 We thought why not make a list of their performances
 dekhte hai ki din guzarane ke saath-saath ye kya kya karte hai
 Keeping your fight relevant and interesting is also a bigger struggle than the original
 in kisaanon main 25 saal kaa noujvaan bhi he or 75 saal ke bujurg kisaan bhi
 We included her performance in the prime time of March 17
 duusare din do kisaan ped par chadh gaye or faansee lagane kii koshish kii, lekin police ne samay rahete is ghatana ko roak diya
 On the third day, his performance became something else
 kisaanon ne apane kapade utaar die or patton se sharir ko dhank liya
 Painted the entire body on the fourth day
 chathe din ve rudraksh kii maala pahanakar pradarshan karne lage
 On the seventh, eighth and ninth days, they did not do anything different
 jantar mantar par hi pradarshan karte rahe
 Took a padyatra on the 10th day in langot till the Supreme Court, on the 11th day Jantar became a dog at Mantar and started barking
 12 wein din ek kisaan laash ban gaya, kisaan laash ke aasapaas baithkar ghanta bajaane lage, rone lage,laash bane kisaan kii shavyatra bhi nikaali
 On the 13th day, they started crying
 14 wein dilli railway stesan gaye or vahaan se chuuhe pakadakar le aae
 You imagine, catching and carrying mice running on the tracks and then pressing them with teeth
 yah sab kya aasaan rahaa hoga? kya ye sirf inaki naatakeeyata rahi hogi? naatakeey hone ke to or bhi tareeke hai, koi chuha kyon pakadega? 15 wein din inhone ek naatak kiya
 All ministers' offices were also visited, ministers from Tamil Nadu came in Modi government, Rahul Gandhi also went and many ordinary people also went
 magar aane jane se zyaada inaki dilchaspee apni baat manwaane main he
 They say that if something happens, they will win the battle from Delhi
 inkaa kahana he ki agar sarkaar train main bitha degi to chen khinch denge, phir bhi utarane nahin degi to chalati train se kud jaaenge
 Now these farmers say that they are going to drink urine
 yahi nahin unhone jantar mantar par ek naatak bhi khelaa
 In it, the Prime Minister was shown whipping and the farmers kept whip on the ground wearing Gandhi's mask and asking for help
 yah unke pradarshan kaa 15 waan din tha
 We can say that their performance is becoming bizarre
 lekin is tarah se pradarshan kii kalpana ham sabane kab kii thi
 But remember one thing
 netaaon ke yahaan lakhon kaa theka lekar baithe event manager isse kuch apana idia banaaenge
 Now they will protest against any government or political party, then they will come out with the idea everyday
 vicitra-vicitra harakatein karenge or event main badal denge
 Right now you feel that their performance is unnoticed, but soon someone is going to remove a new idea from their performance
 16 wein din saanp kaa maance khaaya
 The snake was brought from Tamil Nadu
 17 wein din kaale kapade se sar or aankh ko dhank liya
 On the 18th day he became a beggar with a bowl
 19 wein din aadha sar or aadhi moonch mundava lee
 On the 21st day, he cleaned his mustache and on the 22nd, he stood on the head of the farmers
 is andolan kaa netritv 70 saal ke ek vakil kar rahe hai
 They say that they came to Delhi last year too
 tamilnadu ke kisaanon kii vyathaa bataai thi magar kisi ne parvaah nahin kii
 They are definitely protesting in Delhi, but seeing the political activities of Tamil Nadu, they do not think that the legislators or the government there are concerned about the farmers
 ab 23 waan din aa chukaa tha
 Their performance had taken some other form
 24 wein din in kisaanon ne kapade se khud ko dhank liya
 On the 25th day a man became the Prime Minister and the farmer cut his palm and offered blood at his feet
 26 wein din bhukh hadtaal kii
 On the 27th, they began to protest by hanging them in the neck
 28 wein or 29 wein din inkaa pradarshan jhajhakor dene vaala rahaa
 Nobody had imagined that they would go naked and start demonstrating while returning their memorandum to the Prime Minister's Office
 jaise-jaise din gujara in kisaanon kii zid badhati gai
 They are in need of help of forty thousand crores
 kisi bhi sarkaar ke liye mushkil he
 The central government has also announced the help of more than 2000 crores, but it will be able to give forty thousand crores, we can only guess
 29 wein din inhone jo kiya wo or bhi mushkil tha
 Spreaded the rice like a sheet on the open road
 us par daal daalkar khaane lage
 You and we can never eat like this, cannot even see someone else eating
 30 wein din unhone jis sharir ko bhashaa main badla tha, usee kii chaati or peeth par maang likh di
 Blacks became boards
 31 wein din kii jaankaree nahin he hamaare paas
 On the 32nd, these farmers demonstrated wearing saris
 dhyaan rakhie- laash bane, nirvastr hue, moonche muda lee or ab sari pahanakar pradarshan karne lage
 These farmers said that a farmer took a loan by pledging his wife's Mangalsutra
 lone nahin chukaa paaya to sahuukaar mangalsutra le gaya
 The farmers repeated this scene at Jantar Mantar
 dhaage ke mangal sutara pahanakar pradarshan karne lage
 According to the media report, the government of the state has waived debts of Rs 5,780 crore taken from the cooperative banks of the state
 hoicourt ne bhi kaha he ki tamilnadu ke kisaanon kaa karz maaf hona chahie
 This time Tamil Nadu has received the lowest rainfall in the last 140 years
 pichley saal yahaan 170 millimetre barish hui jabaki ausatan 437 millimetre barish hoti he
 There are many districts where there has been 60 percent less rainfall
 rajya ke kai ilaakon main pani kaa sankat he
 80% of the farmers are small farmers
 tamilnadu main aapane suna hoga ki sasta khaanaa diya ja rahaa he
 The farmers are also provided grain at cheaper rates
 iske baad bhi kisaan aatmahatya kyon kar rahe hai
 Because the debt burden has crossed their limit
 34 wein din kisaan aurat ban gaye, chuudi todakar pradarshan karne lage
 On the 37th, the farmers wore tattered kurtas
 pagal ban gaye
 Now they started performing madly
 tippaniyan You can say that there is extremism, bizarre in these demonstrations of farmers, but also see how the common farmer is fighting about his words
 ladane ke liye kin-kin tareekon ko ijad kar rahaa he
 His house is settled at Jantar Mantar
 maang puri hone tak jane vaale nahin hai isliye vahiin raat bitaate hai, vahiin khaanaa banaate hai
 People from around are also coming to help
 koi aarthik madad kar rahaa he to koi naitik madad de rahaa he
 But there is no loud noise in their performances
 netaa mantri gaye hai magar jane kii aupchaarikta darj ho, utane bhar ke liye gaye hai
 The farmers are trapped in the Chakravyuh
 aisa nahin he ki sarkarein kuch nahin karti hai lekin unka karnaa kaaphi nahin he
 The creativity shown by the farmers makes them understand their uneasiness
 kuch log ninda bhi kar rahe honge ki itnaa atvaad kyon
 Many times compassion should be shown
 samajhane kii koshish kerani chahie ki kyon koi munh main chuha dabaa rahaa he, zamin par daal-bhaat bichhaakar kha rahaa he
 What does he want to say, what does he want to get
 aisi hi zid or rachanaatmakataa chahie kisaanon ko apni samasya se nikalne ke liye
 Also for demonstration and to change the way of farming
 
 
 
 The same emphasis would have to be made to get out of the cycle of expensive farming
 
 
 aaj desh ke tamaam zilon main bina kisi raajnneetik dal ke samarthan ke chote-chote samooh banaakar maa-baap tamaam adhikariyon ko gyaapan de rahe hai
 Not much is being achieved, but their fight is breaking the delusion that these shops opened in the name of private schools are doing everything well

 But look at how fast changes are taking place in the leader or organization to come to your TV screen
 kuch saal pehle jab ramlila maidan main din-raat satyagrah chal rahaa tha tab narmada nadi main kuch kisaan jal satyagrah karne utar gaye
 213 people performed for 32 days standing in water across the waist
 unke paanv kharaab ho gaye the
 What are the common people having to do to get the attention of media and government
 ve apni rachanaatmakataa ke zarie is loktantr ko samrudh karte rahe
 Sometimes they win, sometimes they lose
 14 march ko tamilnadu se 134 kisaan dilli aae
 There is a severe drought in Tamil Nadu, no one has seen such a drought in 140 years, but the leaders there are playing the game of power
 kisaan muaavze or karz maafee kii maang ko lekar dilli aae
 We did prime time on March 17, how these farmers, after coming to the Hindi-speaking state, converted their bodies into language
 mushkil se inke bich hindi bolne vaala he
 Even if we could speak Hindi, there is no guarantee that the media and the government would listen
 yah pahalu abhi chhod dijie, dekhie ki in kisaanon ne apane pradarshan ko kis tarah se har din ek nai oonchai di he
 This is a period of creativity in performances
 kisaan nahin ye asli kavi hai
 There is a picture of when they landed at the station
 stesan se utarate hi vahaan choti moti sabha jaisi kar lee
 Instructed everyone where to go and what to do and then left for Jantar Mantar
 ek aise shahar main jahaan inhen us media se bhi hode lenaa tha jisaki praathamiktaayen anya kaarnon se tay hoti rahati hai
 Soon these people started becoming incidents every day
 sabase pehle khud ko ardhangn kiya
 Took a bowl in hand and wrote a bagger on it
 aadhe dhanke tan ke saath ye kisaan karz maafee kii maang karne lage
 There was also a garland of Narmund in his neck
 inkaa kahana tha ki yah khopadi un kisaanon kii he jinhone karz se tang aakar aatmahatya kar lee he
 They have been performing at Jantar Mantar for 40 days
 134 kisaan aae the jinamein se kai biimaar padakar waapas chale gaye magar vahaan se sau kisaanon kaa nayaa jattha jald hi dilli aane vaala he
 We thought why not make a list of their performances
 dekhte hai ki din guzarane ke saath-saath ye kya kya karte hai
 Keeping your fight relevant and interesting is also a bigger struggle than the original
 in kisaanon main 25 saal kaa noujvaan bhi he or 75 saal ke bujurg kisaan bhi
 We included her performance in the prime time of March 17
 duusare din do kisaan ped par chadh gaye or faansee lagane kii koshish kii, lekin police ne samay rahete is ghatana ko roak diya
 On the third day, his performance became something else
 kisaanon ne apane kapade utaar die or patton se sharir ko dhank liya
 Painted the entire body on the fourth day
 chathe din ve rudraksh kii maala pahanakar pradarshan karne lage
 On the seventh, eighth and ninth days, they did not do anything different
 jantar mantar par hi pradarshan karte rahe
 Took a padyatra on the 10th day in langot till the Supreme Court, on the 11th day Jantar became a dog at Mantar and started barking
 12 wein din ek kisaan laash ban gaya, kisaan laash ke aasapaas baithkar ghanta bajaane lage, rone lage,laash bane kisaan kii shavyatra bhi nikaali
 On the 13th day, they started crying
 14 wein dilli railway stesan gaye or vahaan se chuuhe pakadakar le aae
 You imagine, catching and carrying mice running on the tracks and then pressing them with teeth
 yah sab kya aasaan rahaa hoga? kya ye sirf inaki naatakeeyata rahi hogi? naatakeey hone ke to or bhi tareeke hai, koi chuha kyon pakadega? 15 wein din inhone ek naatak kiya
 All ministers' offices were also visited, ministers from Tamil Nadu came in Modi government, Rahul Gandhi also went and many ordinary people also went
 magar aane jane se zyaada inaki dilchaspee apni baat manwaane main he
 They say that if something happens, they will win the battle from Delhi
 inkaa kahana he ki agar sarkaar train main bitha degi to chen khinch denge, phir bhi utarane nahin degi to chalati train se kud jaaenge
 Now these farmers say that they are going to drink urine
 yahi nahin unhone jantar mantar par ek naatak bhi khelaa
 In it, the Prime Minister was shown whipping and the farmers kept whip on the ground wearing Gandhi's mask and asking for help
 yah unke pradarshan kaa 15 waan din tha
 We can say that their performance is becoming bizarre
 lekin is tarah se pradarshan kii kalpana ham sabane kab kii thi
 But remember one thing
 netaaon ke yahaan lakhon kaa theka lekar baithe event manager isse kuch apana idia banaaenge
 Now they will protest against any government or political party, then they will come out with the idea everyday
 vicitra-vicitra harakatein karenge or event main badal denge
 Right now you feel that their performance is unnoticed, but soon someone is going to remove a new idea from their performance
 16 wein din saanp kaa maance khaaya
 The snake was brought from Tamil Nadu
 17 wein din kaale kapade se sar or aankh ko dhank liya
 On the 18th day he became a beggar with a bowl
 19 wein din aadha sar or aadhi moonch mundava lee
 On the 21st day, he cleaned his mustache and on the 22nd, he stood on the head of the farmers
 is andolan kaa netritv 70 saal ke ek vakil kar rahe hai
 They say that they came to Delhi last year too
 tamilnadu ke kisaanon kii vyathaa bataai thi magar kisi ne parvaah nahin kii
 They are definitely protesting in Delhi, but seeing the political activities of Tamil Nadu, they do not think that the legislators or the government there are concerned about the farmers
 ab 23 waan din aa chukaa tha
 Their performance had taken some other form
 24 wein din in kisaanon ne kapade se khud ko dhank liya
 On the 25th day a man became the Prime Minister and the farmer cut his palm and offered blood at his feet
 26 wein din bhukh hadtaal kii
 On the 27th, they began to protest by hanging them in the neck
 28 wein or 29 wein din inkaa pradarshan jhajhakor dene vaala rahaa
 Nobody had imagined that they would go naked and start demonstrating while returning their memorandum to the Prime Minister's Office
 jaise-jaise din gujara in kisaanon kii zid badhati gai
 They are in need of help of forty thousand crores
 kisi bhi sarkaar ke liye mushkil he
 The central government has also announced the help of more than 2000 crores, but it will be able to give forty thousand crores, we can only guess
 29 wein din inhone jo kiya wo or bhi mushkil tha
 Spreaded the rice like a sheet on the open road
 us par daal daalkar khaane lage
 You and we can never eat like this, cannot even see someone else eating
 30 wein din unhone jis sharir ko bhashaa main badla tha, usee kii chaati or peeth par maang likh di
 Blacks became boards
 31 wein din kii jaankaree nahin he hamaare paas
 On the 32nd, these farmers demonstrated wearing saris
 dhyaan rakhie- laash bane, nirvastr hue, moonche muda lee or ab sari pahanakar pradarshan karne lage
 These farmers said that a farmer took a loan by pledging his wife's Mangalsutra
 lone nahin chukaa paaya to sahuukaar mangalsutra le gaya
 The farmers repeated this scene at Jantar Mantar
 dhaage ke mangal sutara pahanakar pradarshan karne lage
 According to the media report, the government of the state has waived debts of Rs 5,780 crore taken from the cooperative banks of the state
 hoicourt ne bhi kaha he ki tamilnadu ke kisaanon kaa karz maaf hona chahie
 This time Tamil Nadu has received the lowest rainfall in the last 140 years
 pichley saal yahaan 170 millimetre barish hui jabaki ausatan 437 millimetre barish hoti he
 There are many districts where there has been 60 percent less rainfall
 rajya ke kai ilaakon main pani kaa sankat he
 80% of the farmers are small farmers
 tamilnadu main aapane suna hoga ki sasta khaanaa diya ja rahaa he
 The farmers are also provided grain at cheaper rates
 iske baad bhi kisaan aatmahatya kyon kar rahe hai
 Because the debt burden has crossed their limit
 34 wein din kisaan aurat ban gaye, chuudi todakar pradarshan karne lage
 On the 37th, the farmers wore tattered kurtas
 pagal ban gaye
 Now they started performing madly
 tippaniyan You can say that there is extremism, bizarre in these demonstrations of farmers, but also see how the common farmer is fighting about his words
 ladane ke liye kin-kin tareekon ko ijad kar rahaa he
 His house is settled at Jantar Mantar
 maang puri hone tak jane vaale nahin hai isliye vahiin raat bitaate hai, vahiin khaanaa banaate hai
 People from around are also coming to help
 koi aarthik madad kar rahaa he to koi naitik madad de rahaa he
 But there is no loud noise in their performances
 netaa mantri gaye hai magar jane kii aupchaarikta darj ho, utane bhar ke liye gaye hai
 The farmers are trapped in the Chakravyuh
 aisa nahin he ki sarkarein kuch nahin karti hai lekin unka karnaa kaaphi nahin he
 The creativity shown by the farmers makes them understand their uneasiness
 kuch log ninda bhi kar rahe honge ki itnaa atvaad kyon
 Many times compassion should be shown
 samajhane kii koshish kerani chahie ki kyon koi munh main chuha dabaa rahaa he, zamin par daal-bhaat bichhaakar kha rahaa he
 What does he want to say, what does he want to get
 aisi hi zid or rachanaatmakataa chahie kisaanon ko apni samasya se nikalne ke liye
 Also for demonstration and to change the way of farming
 
 
 
 The same emphasis would have to be made to get out of the cycle of expensive farming
 
 
 netaa agar ek minute main chahen to privet skulon kii dhaandhlee band ho sakati he
 If they want, government schools can also be improved, but everyone knows that the ultimate goal is to make notes
 kaam ke naam par utana hi karnaa jisase media main hedline ban jaae ki skool kaa daura ho gaya
 Teacher is grabbed, then questions of thousands of vacant teachers in schools, questions from benches to books are lost somewhere
 aap dekhenge ki hamaari aaj kii raajnneeti vahi kar rahi he jisase whats ap yaa fasebuk main aplod karne ke liye tasviren chhaviyaan paidaa kii ja saken
 So that the work is not as much as it should be; it seems that yes something is happening
 ab to kai maheene biit gaye hai, bilderon par lagaam lagane kaa daawa karne vaale kanoon ko bane hue
 Even after this, why is the performance of those buying flats in Noida Greater Noida going on every Sunday
 kya aapane kisi raajnneetik dal ke netaa ko ravivaar kii dhoop main inke saath pradarshan karte dekha he
 They will not be seen, yes, they will definitely be seen calling in their house, whose picture is much more printed than the people performing in the media
 akhir janata ke khadey kiye hue sangharsh main bina dikhe koi netaa nayak yaa jananaayak kaise ban jaataa he
 Only you make it
 phir bhi taqatvar bilderon ke khilaaf pradarshnon kaa yah silsilaa ummid nahin jagaata he ki koi kitni bhi satta hasil kar le, loktantr ko chin nahin saktaa he
 Who are these people who are taking iron from builders, will think about them sometime
 skool or real estate aisa garh he jahaan netaaon kii jaan basati he
 Through this, people were encouraged
 unki kamai hadpi ja rahi he iske baad bhi thodi-bahut sankhya main hi sahi magar kuch log hai jo awaz uthaa rahe hai
 Looking at these people should be full of expectations
 gaay or mandir se fursat nikaalkar sochiega ki jab janata kaa koi mudda hota he to netaa kahaan hota he
 It is not that the issues of the leader do not belong to the public, but the public does not decide the issues of the leaders
 unka apana tarika hota he
 If the farmers march on foot, two pictures will not be printed, two minutes of footage will not be seen on TV, but if the leaders of the big political party on the farmers do the padyatra, then it will be telecasted for hours and there will be applause that the leader who understands the farmers has come
 yah sab aapke aashirwad se kaayam he
 No outsider but you made it
 ek tasviir he, march 2015 kii, jharkhand kii he
 On a paper, people are eating, they are doing shit
 english main aajkal ise vashroom janaa kehete hai kyonki tailet yaa latrin ab sunne main tatti yaa pakhaana jaisaa bhadda lagata he
 This picture is of the Barwadih block office of Naxalite affected Latehar where people from sixty villages had gathered
 to yah kaagaj par tatti karte hue kya kar rahe hai
 Two years ago, these farmers opposed the Land Acquisition Act
 inkaa lakshya tha ki pradarshnon ko dekhne or dekhakar na dekhne kii hamaari aadat ko gaharaa jhatka lage
 Our colleague Alok Pandey then wrote that the idea did not come from any PR or event management company but was the fundamental thinking of tribal society leaders
 ve bataanaa chaahate the ki bhoomi adhigrahan kanoon main kitna durgandh he
 How much creativity has come in common people's demonstrations and leaders' events
 haalanki donon kii rachanaatmakataa main kaaphi antar he, donon kii naitikta main bhi antar he lekin badlaav to aa hi chukaa he
 Earlier there used to be a padyatra, then that rath yatra, then that roadshow happened and now the roadshow has also changed
 leisure lite se lekar hazaron bikon kaa istamaal hota he
 Everything has started happening as if politics is being filmed at Mehboob Studio in Mumbai
 vahiin par switzaraland he vahiin par england he
 Leaders' performances are now broadcast on TV
 unka camera angel tak badal gaya he taaki aap ke dimag par gaharaa asar ho
 Even the clothes of the poverty alleviators and the leaders who reached the stage with poverty are designers, expensive
 ye sab aapako acha bhi lagata he
 But look at how fast changes are taking place in the leader or organization to come to your TV screen

 134 kisaan aae the jinamein se kai biimaar padakar waapas chale gaye magar vahaan se sau kisaanon kaa nayaa jattha jald hi dilli aane vaala he
 We thought why not make a list of their performances
 dekhte hai ki din guzarane ke saath-saath ye kya kya karte hai
 Keeping your fight relevant and interesting is also a bigger struggle than the original
 in kisaanon main 25 saal kaa noujvaan bhi he or 75 saal ke bujurg kisaan bhi
 We included her performance in the prime time of March 17
 duusare din do kisaan ped par chadh gaye or faansee lagane kii koshish kii, lekin police ne samay rahete is ghatana ko roak diya
 On the third day, his performance became something else
 kisaanon ne apane kapade utaar die or patton se sharir ko dhank liya
 Painted the entire body on the fourth day
 chathe din ve rudraksh kii maala pahanakar pradarshan karne lage
 On the seventh, eighth and ninth days, they did not do anything different
 jantar mantar par hi pradarshan karte rahe
 Took a padyatra on the 10th day in langot till the Supreme Court, on the 11th day Jantar became a dog at Mantar and started barking
 12 wein din ek kisaan laash ban gaya, kisaan laash ke aasapaas baithkar ghanta bajaane lage, rone lage,laash bane kisaan kii shavyatra bhi nikaali
 On the 13th day, they started crying
 14 wein dilli railway stesan gaye or vahaan se chuuhe pakadakar le aae
 You imagine, catching and carrying mice running on the tracks and then pressing them with teeth
 yah sab kya aasaan rahaa hoga? kya ye sirf inaki naatakeeyata rahi hogi? naatakeey hone ke to or bhi tareeke hai, koi chuha kyon pakadega? 15 wein din inhone ek naatak kiya
 All ministers' offices were also visited, ministers from Tamil Nadu came in Modi government, Rahul Gandhi also went and many ordinary people also went
 magar aane jane se zyaada inaki dilchaspee apni baat manwaane main he
 They say that if something happens, they will win the battle from Delhi
 inkaa kahana he ki agar sarkaar train main bitha degi to chen khinch denge, phir bhi utarane nahin degi to chalati train se kud jaaenge
 Now these farmers say that they are going to drink urine
 yahi nahin unhone jantar mantar par ek naatak bhi khelaa
 In it, the Prime Minister was shown whipping and the farmers kept whip on the ground wearing Gandhi's mask and asking for help
 yah unke pradarshan kaa 15 waan din tha
 We can say that their performance is becoming bizarre
 lekin is tarah se pradarshan kii kalpana ham sabane kab kii thi
 But remember one thing
 netaaon ke yahaan lakhon kaa theka lekar baithe event manager isse kuch apana idia banaaenge
 Now they will protest against any government or political party, then they will come out with the idea everyday
 vicitra-vicitra harakatein karenge or event main badal denge
 Right now you feel that their performance is unnoticed, but soon someone is going to remove a new idea from their performance
 16 wein din saanp kaa maance khaaya
 The snake was brought from Tamil Nadu
 17 wein din kaale kapade se sar or aankh ko dhank liya
 On the 18th day he became a beggar with a bowl
 19 wein din aadha sar or aadhi moonch mundava lee
 On the 21st day, he cleaned his mustache and on the 22nd, he stood on the head of the farmers
 is andolan kaa netritv 70 saal ke ek vakil kar rahe hai
 They say that they came to Delhi last year too
 tamilnadu ke kisaanon kii vyathaa bataai thi magar kisi ne parvaah nahin kii
 They are definitely protesting in Delhi, but seeing the political activities of Tamil Nadu, they do not think that the legislators or the government there are concerned about the farmers
 ab 23 waan din aa chukaa tha
 Their performance had taken some other form
 24 wein din in kisaanon ne kapade se khud ko dhank liya
 On the 25th day a man became the Prime Minister and the farmer cut his palm and offered blood at his feet
 26 wein din bhukh hadtaal kii
 On the 27th, they began to protest by hanging them in the neck
 28 wein or 29 wein din inkaa pradarshan jhajhakor dene vaala rahaa
 Nobody had imagined that they would go naked and start demonstrating while returning their memorandum to the Prime Minister's Office
 jaise-jaise din gujara in kisaanon kii zid badhati gai
 They are in need of help of forty thousand crores
 kisi bhi sarkaar ke liye mushkil he
 The central government has also announced the help of more than 2000 crores, but it will be able to give forty thousand crores, we can only guess
 29 wein din inhone jo kiya wo or bhi mushkil tha
 Spreaded the rice like a sheet on the open road
 us par daal daalkar khaane lage
 You and we can never eat like this, cannot even see someone else eating
 30 wein din unhone jis sharir ko bhashaa main badla tha, usee kii chaati or peeth par maang likh di
 Blacks became boards
 31 wein din kii jaankaree nahin he hamaare paas
 On the 32nd, these farmers demonstrated wearing saris
 dhyaan rakhie- laash bane, nirvastr hue, moonche muda lee or ab sari pahanakar pradarshan karne lage
 These farmers said that a farmer took a loan by pledging his wife's Mangalsutra
 lone nahin chukaa paaya to sahuukaar mangalsutra le gaya
 The farmers repeated this scene at Jantar Mantar
 dhaage ke mangal sutara pahanakar pradarshan karne lage
 According to the media report, the government of the state has waived debts of Rs 5,780 crore taken from the cooperative banks of the state
 hoicourt ne bhi kaha he ki tamilnadu ke kisaanon kaa karz maaf hona chahie
 This time Tamil Nadu has received the lowest rainfall in the last 140 years
 pichley saal yahaan 170 millimetre barish hui jabaki ausatan 437 millimetre barish hoti he
 There are many districts where there has been 60 percent less rainfall
 rajya ke kai ilaakon main pani kaa sankat he
 80% of the farmers are small farmers
 tamilnadu main aapane suna hoga ki sasta khaanaa diya ja rahaa he
 The farmers are also provided grain at cheaper rates
 iske baad bhi kisaan aatmahatya kyon kar rahe hai
 Because the debt burden has crossed their limit
 34 wein din kisaan aurat ban gaye, chuudi todakar pradarshan karne lage
 On the 37th, the farmers wore tattered kurtas
 pagal ban gaye
 Now they started performing madly
 tippaniyan You can say that there is extremism, bizarre in these demonstrations of farmers, but also see how the common farmer is fighting about his words
 ladane ke liye kin-kin tareekon ko ijad kar rahaa he
 His house is settled at Jantar Mantar
 maang puri hone tak jane vaale nahin hai isliye vahiin raat bitaate hai, vahiin khaanaa banaate hai
 People from around are also coming to help
 koi aarthik madad kar rahaa he to koi naitik madad de rahaa he
 But there is no loud noise in their performances
 netaa mantri gaye hai magar jane kii aupchaarikta darj ho, utane bhar ke liye gaye hai
 The farmers are trapped in the Chakravyuh
 aisa nahin he ki sarkarein kuch nahin karti hai lekin unka karnaa kaaphi nahin he
 The creativity shown by the farmers makes them understand their uneasiness
 kuch log ninda bhi kar rahe honge ki itnaa atvaad kyon
 Many times compassion should be shown
 samajhane kii koshish kerani chahie ki kyon koi munh main chuha dabaa rahaa he, zamin par daal-bhaat bichhaakar kha rahaa he
 What does he want to say, what does he want to get
 aisi hi zid or rachanaatmakataa chahie kisaanon ko apni samasya se nikalne ke liye
 Also for demonstration and to change the way of farming
 
 
 
 The same emphasis would have to be made to get out of the cycle of expensive farming
 
 
 skool or real estate aisa garh he jahaan netaaon kii jaan basati he
 Through this, people were encouraged
 unki kamai hadpi ja rahi he iske baad bhi thodi-bahut sankhya main hi sahi magar kuch log hai jo awaz uthaa rahe hai
 Looking at these people should be full of expectations
 gaay or mandir se fursat nikaalkar sochiega ki jab janata kaa koi mudda hota he to netaa kahaan hota he
 It is not that the issues of the leader do not belong to the public, but the public does not decide the issues of the leaders
 unka apana tarika hota he
 If the farmers march on foot, two pictures will not be printed, two minutes of footage will not be seen on TV, but if the leaders of the big political party on the farmers do the padyatra, then it will be telecasted for hours and there will be applause that the leader who understands the farmers has come
 yah sab aapke aashirwad se kaayam he
 No outsider but you made it
 ek tasviir he, march 2015 kii, jharkhand kii he
 On a paper, people are eating , doing shit 
 english main aajkal ise vashroom janaa kehete hai kyonki tailet yaa latrin ab sunne main tatti yaa pakhaana jaisaa bhadda lagata he
 This picture is of the Barwadih block office of Naxalite affected Latehar where people from sixty villages had gathered
 to yah kaagaj par tatti karte hue kya kar rahe hai
 Two years ago, these farmers opposed the Land Acquisition Act
 inkaa lakshya tha ki pradarshnon ko dekhne or dekhakar na dekhne kii hamaari aadat ko gaharaa jhatka lage
 Our colleague Alok Pandey then wrote that the idea did not come from any PR or event management company but was the fundamental thinking of tribal society leaders
 ve bataanaa chaahate the ki bhoomi adhigrahan kanoon main kitna durgandh he
 How much creativity has come in common people's demonstrations and leaders' events
 haalanki donon kii rachanaatmakataa main kaaphi antar he, donon kii naitikta main bhi antar he lekin badlaav to aa hi chukaa he
 Earlier there used to be a padyatra, then that rath yatra, then that roadshow happened and now the roadshow has also changed
 leisure lite se lekar hazaron bikon kaa istamaal hota he
 Everything has started happening as if politics is being filmed at Mehboob Studio in Mumbai
 vahiin par switzaraland he vahiin par england he
 Leaders' performances are now broadcast on TV
 unka camera angel tak badal gaya he taaki aap ke dimag par gaharaa asar ho
 Even the clothes of the poverty alleviators and the leaders who reached the stage with poverty are designers, expensive
 ye sab aapako acha bhi lagata he
 But look at how fast changes are taking place in the leader or organization to come to your TV screen
 kuch saal pehle jab ramlila maidan main din-raat satyagrah chal rahaa tha tab narmada nadi main kuch kisaan jal satyagrah karne utar gaye
 213 people performed for 32 days standing in water across the waist
 unke paanv kharaab ho gaye the
 What are the common people having to do to get the attention of media and government
 ve apni rachanaatmakataa ke zarie is loktantr ko samrudh karte rahe
 Sometimes they win, sometimes they lose
 14 march ko tamilnadu se 134 kisaan dilli aae
 There is a severe drought in Tamil Nadu, no one has seen such a drought in 140 years, but the leaders there are playing the game of power
 kisaan muaavze or karz maafee kii maang ko lekar dilli aae
 We did prime time on March 17, how these farmers, after coming to the Hindi-speaking state, converted their bodies into language
 mushkil se inke bich hindi bolne vaala he
 Even if we could speak Hindi, there is no guarantee that the media and the government would listen
 yah pahalu abhi chhod dijie, dekhie ki in kisaanon ne apane pradarshan ko kis tarah se har din ek nai oonchai di he
 This is a period of creativity in performances
 kisaan nahin ye asli kavi hai
 There is a picture of when they landed at the station
 stesan se utarate hi vahaan choti moti sabha jaisi kar lee
 Instructed everyone where to go and what to do and then left for Jantar Mantar
 ek aise shahar main jahaan inhen us media se bhi hode lenaa tha jisaki praathamiktaayen anya kaarnon se tay hoti rahati hai
 Soon these people started becoming incidents every day
 sabase pehle khud ko ardhangn kiya
 Took a bowl in hand and wrote a bagger on it
 aadhe dhanke tan ke saath ye kisaan karz maafee kii maang karne lage
 There was also a garland of Narmund in his neck
 inkaa kahana tha ki yah khopadi un kisaanon kii he jinhone karz se tang aakar aatmahatya kar lee he
 They have been performing at Jantar Mantar for 40 days

 The farmers repeated this scene at Jantar Mantar
 dhaage ke mangal sutara pahanakar pradarshan karne lage
 According to the media report, the government of the state has waived debts of Rs 5,780 crore taken from the cooperative banks of the state
 hoicourt ne bhi kaha he ki tamilnadu ke kisaanon kaa karz maaf hona chahie
 This time Tamil Nadu has received the lowest rainfall in the last 140 years
 pichley saal yahaan 170 millimetre barish hui jabaki ausatan 437 millimetre barish hoti he
 There are many districts where there has been 60 percent less rainfall
 rajya ke kai ilaakon main pani kaa sankat he
 80% of the farmers are small farmers
 tamilnadu main aapane suna hoga ki sasta khaanaa diya ja rahaa he
 The farmers are also provided grain at cheaper rates
 iske baad bhi kisaan aatmahatya kyon kar rahe hai
 Because the debt burden has crossed their limit
 34 wein din kisaan aurat ban gaye, chuudi todakar pradarshan karne lage
 On the 37th, the farmers wore tattered kurtas
 pagal ban gaye
 Now they started performing madly
 tippaniyan You can say that there is extremism, bizarre in these demonstrations of farmers, but also see how the common farmer is fighting about his words
 ladane ke liye kin-kin tareekon ko ijad kar rahaa he
 His house is settled at Jantar Mantar
 maang puri hone tak jane vaale nahin hai isliye vahiin raat bitaate hai, vahiin khaanaa banaate hai
 People from around are also coming to help
 koi aarthik madad kar rahaa he to koi naitik madad de rahaa he
 But there is no loud noise in their performances
 netaa mantri gaye hai magar jane kii aupchaarikta darj ho, utane bhar ke liye gaye hai
 The farmers are trapped in the Chakravyuh
 aisa nahin he ki sarkarein kuch nahin karti hai lekin unka karnaa kaaphi nahin he
 The creativity shown by the farmers makes them understand their uneasiness
 kuch log ninda bhi kar rahe honge ki itnaa atvaad kyon
 Many times compassion should be shown
 samajhane kii koshish kerani chahie ki kyon koi munh main chuha dabaa rahaa he, zamin par daal-bhaat bichhaakar kha rahaa he
 What does he want to say, what does he want to get
 aisi hi zid or rachanaatmakataa chahie kisaanon ko apni samasya se nikalne ke liye
 Also for demonstration and to change the way of farming
 
 
 
 The same emphasis would have to be made to get out of the cycle of expensive farming
 
 
 aam logon ke pradarshnon or netaaon ke aayojanon main kitni rachanaatmakataa aa gai he
 Although there is a big difference in the creativity of both, there is a difference in the morality of both, but change has already taken place
 pehle padayatra hua karti thi, phir wo rathyatra hui, phir wo road sho hua or ab road sho bhi badal gaya he
 Thousands of bikes range from laser lights
 sab kuch is tarah se hone laga he jaise raajnneeti mumbai ke mehboob studio main filmai ja rahi he
 Switzerland is there, England is there
 netaaon ke pradarshan ab tivi par prasaaran ke hisaab se hote hai
 His camera has changed to the angle so that you have a deep impact on your mind
 garibi dur karne vaale or garibi jhelkar manch par pahunche netaaon ke kapade tak diziner hai, mahange hai
 You also like all this
 lekin gaur se dekhie aapke tivi screen par aane ke liye netaa yaa aayojan main kitni teji se badlaav aa rahe hai
 a few years ago when Satyagraha was going on day and night in Ramlila Maidan, some farmers got down to perform water satyagraha in Narmada River
 213 logon ne 32 dinon tak qamar bhar pani main khadey hokar pradarshan kiya tha
 His legs were damaged
 media or sarkaar kaa dhyaan aakarshith karne ke liye aam logon ko kya-kya karnaa pad rahaa he
 He continued to enrich this democracy through his creativity
 kabhi jeet jate hai, kabhi haar bhi jate hai
 On 14 March, 134 farmers from Tamil Nadu arrived in Delhi
 tamilnadu main bhayankar sookhaa he, 140 saal main aisa sookhaa kisi ne nahin dekha, magar vahaan ke netaa satta kaa khel khel rahe hai
 The farmers came to Delhi seeking compensation and loan waiver
 hamane 17 march ko prime time kiya tha ki kis tarah hindi bhashi pradesh main aakar in kisaanon ne apni deh ko hi bhashaa main badal diya
 Hardly anyone who speaks Hindi among them
 vaise hindi bol pate tab bhi koi guarantee nahin he ki media or sarkaar sunati hi
 Leave this aspect now, see how these farmers have given their performance a new height every day
 ye pradarshnon kii rachanaatmakataa kaa daur he
 He is not a farmer, he is a real poet
 jab ye stesan par utre the tabaki ek tasviir he
 As soon as she got down from the station, she did a small gathering there
 sabko nirdesh diya ki kahaan janaa he kya karnaa he or phir jantar mantar ke liye chal die
 In a city where they had to compete with the media whose priorities are fixed for other reasons
 jaldi hi ye log har din khud hi ghatana banane lage
 First of all, he himself was half-hearted
 haath main katoraa liya or us par begar likh diya
 With a half-covered body, these farmers started demanding loan waiver
 inke gale main narmund kii maala bhi thi
 They said that this skull belonged to those farmers who committed suicide by getting fed up with debt
 40 din se ye jantar mantar par pradarshan kar rahe hai
 134 farmers came, many of whom fell back after falling ill, but from there a new batch of hundred farmers is coming to Delhi soon
 hamane sochaa ki kyon na inke pradarshnon kii ek suchi banaate hai
 Let us see what they do as the days go by
 apni ladaai ko praasangik or rochak banaae rakhana bhi mul sangharsh se zyaada bada sangharsh he
 Among these farmers, there is also a young man of 25 years and an old farmer of 75 years
 hamane 17 march ke prime time main inke pradarshan ko shaamil kiya tha
 The next day two farmers climbed the tree and tried to hang it, but the police stopped the incident in time
 tisare din inkaa pradarshan kuch or ho gaya
 The peasants took off their clothes and covered the body with leaves
 chauthe din puure sharir ko paint kar liya
 On the sixth day, he started performing a garland of Rudraksha
 saatven, aathven or naunve din inhone kuch alag nahin kiya
 Jantar continued to perform at Mantar
 10 wein din supreme court tak langot main padayatra kii, 11 wein din jantar mantar par kutta ban gaye or bhaunkkar pradarshan karne lage
 On the 12th day, a farmer became a corpse, the peasants sat around the corpse and started ringing, crying, and also took out the funeral procession of the corpse made of the corpse
 13 wein din ro-rokar pradarshan karne lage
 Went to 14th Delhi railway station and took rats from there
 aap kalpana kiijie, patariyon par daudte chuhon ko pakadana or unhen lekar aana or phir daant se dabaanaa
 What would have been easier? Would it have been just his theatricality? There are other ways to be dramatic, why would anyone catch a mouse? On the 15th day he did a play
 tamaam mantriyon ke daftar bhi gaye, tamilnadu se modi sarkaar main mantri bhi aae, rahul gandhi bhi gaye or bahut se saamaanya log bhi gaye
 But more than coming, they are more interested in getting their point heard
 inkaa kahana he ki kuch ho jaae, dilli se ladaai jitkar jaaenge
 They say that if the government will sit in the train, then they will pull the chain, but even then they will not get off, then they will jump from the moving train
 ab to in kisaanon kaa kahana he ki ve peshaab pine ja rahe hai
 Not only this, he also played a play on Jantar Mantar
 isamen pradhanmantri ko chaabuk maarthe hue dikhaaya gaya or kisaan gandhi kaa mukhauta pahanakar zamin par kodaa khate rahe or madad maangate rahe
 It was the 15th day of his performance
 ham kah sakate hai ki inkaa pradarshan vicitra hota ja rahaa he
 But when did we all imagine the performance in this way
 lekin ek baat yaad rakhiegaa
 Event managers sitting at a contract for lakhs of leaders will create their own ideas
 ab ve kisi sarkaar yaa raajnneetik dal ke khilaaf pradarshan karenge to isi tarah rose-rose idia nikaalenge
 We will do strange things and turn them into events
 abhi aapako lag rahaa he ki inke pradarshan par kisi kaa dhyaan nahin he, magar jaldi hi koi inke pradarshan se nayaa idia nikaalane vaala he
 Ate snake meat on 16th day
 tamilnadu se saanp laayaa gaya tha
 Covered the head and eyes with a black cloth on the 17th day
 18 wein din katoraa lekar bhikhaari ban gaye
 On the 19th day, shaved half the head and half the mustache
 21 wein din puri moonch saaf kar di or 22 wein din kisaanon ke sar ke bal khadey ho gaye
 The movement is led by a 70-year-old lawyer
 inkaa kahana he ki ye pichley saal bhi dilli aae the
 The farmers of Tamil Nadu were told the plight but nobody cared
 ve zarur dilli main pradarshan kar rahe hai magar tamilnadu kii raajnneetik gatividhiyon ko dekhakar nahin lagata ki vahaan ke vidhayakon yaa sarkaar ko kisaanon kii chintaa he
 Now the 23rd day had arrived
 inkaa pradarshan kuch or rup le chukaa tha
 On the 24th, these farmers covered themselves with cloth
 25 wein din ek aadmi pradhanmantri ban gaya or kisaan apni hatheli katkar khun unke charnon main arpit karne laga
 Hunger strike on 26th day
 27 wein din gale main faansee daalkar pradarshan karne lage
 His performance on the 28th and 29th was shocking
 kisi ne kalpana nahin kii thi ki pradhanmantri karyaalay main apana gyaapan dekar lautate vakt ye nirvastr ho jaaenge or pradarshan karne lagenge
 As the days passed the stubbornness of these farmers increased
 chalis hazaar karod kii madad raashi kii maang he inaki
 It is difficult for any government
 centre sarkaar ne bhi 2000 karod se adhik kii madad kaa elaan to kiya hi he magar chalis hazaar karod vah de sakegi, ham andaaza to kar hi sakate hai
 What he did on the 29th was even more difficult
 khuli sadak par chaaval ko chadar kii tarah bicha diya
 Put dal on it and started eating
 aap or ham kabhi is tarah se nahin kha sakate, kisi duusare ko khate dekh bhi nahin sakate
 On the 30th day, he wrote a demand on the chest and back of the body he had changed into language
 blike board ban gaye
 We do not have information on the 31st day
 32 wein din in kisaanon ne sari pahanakar pradarshan kiya
 Keep in mind - dead bodies were made, nude, mustache turned and now started wearing saris
 in kisaanon ne bataaya ki ek kisaan ne patni kaa mangalsutra girvee rakhkar karz liya tha
 If he could not repay the loan, the moneylender took Mangalasutra
 is seen ko kisaanon ne jantar mantar par doharaaya
 Wearing thread threads started to perform
 media report ke anusaar rajya ke sahakaarita bainkon se liye gaye 5,780 karod ke karz vahaan kii sarkaar ne maaf kar die hai
 The High Court has also said that the debt of the farmers of Tamil Nadu should be waived
 is baar tamilnadu main pichley 140 saal main sabase kam barish hui he
 Last year, it received 170 mm of rainfall, while the average rainfall is 437 mm
 kai zile aise hai jahaan 60 fisadi kam barish hui he
 There is a water crisis in many areas of the state
 80 fisadi kisaan, chote kisaan hai
 You may have heard in Tamil Nadu that cheap food is being given
 kisaanon ko sasti daron par anaaj bhi diya jaataa he
 Why farmers are committing suicide even after this
 kyonki karz kaa boj unki seemaa ko paar kar gaya he
 On the 34th day the peasants became women, broke the bangle and began to perform
 37 wein din kisaanon ne fata hua kurta pahan liya
 Became crazy
 ve ab pagal banakar pradarshan karne lage
 The comments aap kah sakate hai ki kisaanon ke in pradarshnon main atvaad he, vicitra bhi hai, lekin yah bhi to dekhie ki aam kisaan apni baat ko lekar kaise lard rahaa he
 What methods are being devised to fight
 jantar mantar par hi unka ghar bas gaya he
 We are not going to leave till the demand is met, so spend the night there, cook there
 aasapaas se log madad bhi karne aa rahe hai
 Someone is giving financial help and some is giving moral help
 lekin inke pradarshnon main koi jor shor se shaamil nahin he
 The leaders have gone to the minister, but the formalities of going have been recorded, they have been filled
 kisaan chakravyuuh main fanse hai
 It is not that governments do nothing but they do not do enough
 kisaanon ne jo rachanaatmakataa dikhaai he usase unki bechaini samaj main aati he
 Some people will also be condemning why so much extremism
 kai baar karunaa dikhaani chahie
 One should try to understand why someone is pressing a mouse in their mouth, eating pulses and rice on the ground
 wo kya kahana chahta he, kya paanaa chahta he
 Farmers need similar stubbornness and creativity to overcome their problems
 pradarshan ke liye bhi or kheti ke taur tareeke badal dene ke liye bhi
 
 
 
 aisa hi jor lagaana hoga mahangi kheti ke chakra se nikalne ke liye

 As the days passed the stubbornness of these farmers increased
 chalis hazaar karod kii madad raashi kii maang he inaki
 It is difficult for any government
 centre sarkaar ne bhi 2000 karod se adhik kii madad kaa elaan to kiya hi he magar chalis hazaar karod vah de sakegi, ham andaaza to kar hi sakate hai
 What he did on the 29th was even more difficult
 khuli sadak par chaaval ko chadar kii tarah bicha diya
 Put dal on it and started eating
 aap or ham kabhi is tarah se nahin kha sakate, kisi duusare ko khate dekh bhi nahin sakate
 On the 30th day, he wrote a demand on the chest and back of the body he had changed into language
 blike board ban gaye
 We do not have information on the 31st day
 32 wein din in kisaanon ne sari pahanakar pradarshan kiya
 Keep in mind - dead bodies were made, nude, mustache turned and now started wearing saris
 in kisaanon ne bataaya ki ek kisaan ne patni kaa mangalsutra girvee rakhkar karz liya tha
 If he could not repay the loan, the moneylender took Mangalasutra
 is seen ko kisaanon ne jantar mantar par doharaaya
 Wearing thread threads started to perform
 media report ke anusaar rajya ke sahakaarita bainkon se liye gaye 5,780 karod ke karz vahaan kii sarkaar ne maaf kar die hai
 The High Court has also said that the debt of the farmers of Tamil Nadu should be waived
 is baar tamilnadu main pichley 140 saal main sabase kam barish hui he
 Last year, it received 170 mm of rainfall, while the average rainfall is 437 mm
 kai zile aise hai jahaan 60 fisadi kam barish hui he
 There is a water crisis in many areas of the state
 80 fisadi kisaan, chote kisaan hai
 You may have heard in Tamil Nadu that cheap food is being given
 kisaanon ko sasti daron par anaaj bhi diya jaataa he
 Why farmers are committing suicide even after this
 kyonki karz kaa boj unki seemaa ko paar kar gaya he
 On the 34th day the peasants became women, broke the bangle and began to perform
 37 wein din kisaanon ne fata hua kurta pahan liya
 Became crazy
 ve ab pagal banakar pradarshan karne lage
 The comments aap kah sakate hai ki kisaanon ke in pradarshnon main atvaad he, vicitra bhi hai, lekin yah bhi to dekhie ki aam kisaan apni baat ko lekar kaise lard rahaa he
 What methods are being devised to fight
 jantar mantar par hi unka ghar bas gaya he
 We are not going to leave till the demand is met, so spend the night there, cook there
 aasapaas se log madad bhi karne aa rahe hai
 Someone is giving financial help and some is giving moral help
 lekin inke pradarshnon main koi jor shor se shaamil nahin he
 The leaders have gone to the minister, but the formalities of going have been recorded, they have been filled
 kisaan chakravyuuh main fanse hai
 It is not that governments do nothing but they do not do enough
 kisaanon ne jo rachanaatmakataa dikhaai he usase unki bechaini samaj main aati he
 Some people will also be condemning why so much extremism
 kai baar karunaa dikhaani chahie
 One should try to understand why someone is pressing a mouse in their mouth, eating pulses and rice on the ground
 wo kya kahana chahta he, kya paanaa chahta he
 Farmers need similar stubbornness and creativity to overcome their problems
 pradarshan ke liye bhi or kheti ke taur tareeke badal dene ke liye bhi
 
 
 
 aisa hi jor lagaana hoga mahangi kheti ke chakra se nikalne ke liye
 
 
 There is a picture of when they landed at the station
 stesan se utarate hi vahaan choti moti sabha jaisi kar lee
 Instructed everyone where to go and what to do and then left for Jantar Mantar
 ek aise shahar main jahaan inhen us media se bhi hode lenaa tha jisaki praathamiktaayen anya kaarnon se tay hoti rahati hai
 Soon these people started becoming incidents every day
 sabase pehle khud ko ardhangn kiya
 Took a bowl in hand and wrote a bagger on it
 aadhe dhanke tan ke saath ye kisaan karz maafee kii maang karne lage
 There was also a garland of Narmund in his neck
 inkaa kahana tha ki yah khopadi un kisaanon kii he jinhone karz se tang aakar aatmahatya kar lee he
 They have been performing at Jantar Mantar for 40 days
 134 kisaan aae the jinamein se kai biimaar padakar waapas chale gaye magar vahaan se sau kisaanon kaa nayaa jattha jald hi dilli aane vaala he
 We thought why not make a list of their performances
 dekhte hai ki din guzarane ke saath-saath ye kya kya karte hai
 Keeping your fight relevant and interesting is also a bigger struggle than the original
 in kisaanon main 25 saal kaa noujvaan bhi he or 75 saal ke bujurg kisaan bhi
 We included her performance in the prime time of March 17
 duusare din do kisaan ped par chadh gaye or faansee lagane kii koshish kii, lekin police ne samay rahete is ghatana ko roak diya
 On the third day, his performance became something else
 kisaanon ne apane kapade utaar die or patton se sharir ko dhank liya
 Painted the entire body on the fourth day
 chathe din ve rudraksh kii maala pahanakar pradarshan karne lage
 On the seventh, eighth and ninth days, they did not do anything different
 jantar mantar par hi pradarshan karte rahe
 Took a padyatra on the 10th day in langot till the Supreme Court, on the 11th day Jantar became a dog at Mantar and started barking
 12 wein din ek kisaan laash ban gaya, kisaan laash ke aasapaas baithkar ghanta bajaane lage, rone lage,laash bane kisaan kii shavyatra bhi nikaali
 On the 13th day, they started crying
 14 wein dilli railway stesan gaye or vahaan se chuuhe pakadakar le aae
 You imagine, catching and carrying mice running on the tracks and then pressing them with teeth
 yah sab kya aasaan rahaa hoga? kya ye sirf inaki naatakeeyata rahi hogi? naatakeey hone ke to or bhi tareeke hai, koi chuha kyon pakadega? 15 wein din inhone ek naatak kiya
 All ministers' offices were also visited, ministers from Tamil Nadu came in Modi government, Rahul Gandhi also went and many ordinary people also went
 magar aane jane se zyaada inaki dilchaspee apni baat manwaane main he
 They say that if something happens, they will win the battle from Delhi
 inkaa kahana he ki agar sarkaar train main bitha degi to chen khinch denge, phir bhi utarane nahin degi to chalati train se kud jaaenge
 Now these farmers say that they are going to drink urine
 yahi nahin unhone jantar mantar par ek naatak bhi khelaa
 In it, the Prime Minister was shown whipping and the farmers kept whip on the ground wearing Gandhi's mask and asking for help
 yah unke pradarshan kaa 15 waan din tha
 We can say that their performance is becoming bizarre
 lekin is tarah se pradarshan kii kalpana ham sabane kab kii thi
 But remember one thing
 netaaon ke yahaan lakhon kaa theka lekar baithe event manager isse kuch apana idia banaaenge
 Now they will protest against any government or political party, then they will come out with the idea everyday
 vicitra-vicitra harakatein karenge or event main badal denge
 Right now you feel that their performance is unnoticed, but soon someone is going to remove a new idea from their performance
 16 wein din saanp kaa maance khaaya
 The snake was brought from Tamil Nadu
 17 wein din kaale kapade se sar or aankh ko dhank liya
 On the 18th day he became a beggar with a bowl
 19 wein din aadha sar or aadhi moonch mundava lee
 On the 21st day, he cleaned his mustache and on the 22nd, he stood on the head of the farmers
 is andolan kaa netritv 70 saal ke ek vakil kar rahe hai
 They say that they came to Delhi last year too
 tamilnadu ke kisaanon kii vyathaa bataai thi magar kisi ne parvaah nahin kii
 They are definitely protesting in Delhi, but seeing the political activities of Tamil Nadu, they do not think that the legislators or the government there are concerned about the farmers
 ab 23 waan din aa chukaa tha
 Their performance had taken some other form
 24 wein din in kisaanon ne kapade se khud ko dhank liya
 On the 25th day a man became the Prime Minister and the farmer cut his palm and offered blood at his feet
 26 wein din bhukh hadtaal kii
 On the 27th, they began to protest by hanging them in the neck
 28 wein or 29 wein din inkaa pradarshan jhajhakor dene vaala rahaa
 Nobody had imagined that they would go naked and start demonstrating while returning their memorandum to the Prime Minister's Office
 jaise-jaise din gujara in kisaanon kii zid badhati gai
 They are in need of help of forty thousand crores
 kisi bhi sarkaar ke liye mushkil he
 The central government has also announced the help of more than 2000 crores, but it will be able to give forty thousand crores, we can only guess
 29 wein din inhone jo kiya wo or bhi mushkil tha
 Spreaded the rice like a sheet on the open road
 us par daal daalkar khaane lage
 You and we can never eat like this, cannot even see someone else eating
 30 wein din unhone jis sharir ko bhashaa main badla tha, usee kii chaati or peeth par maang likh di
 Blacks became boards
 31 wein din kii jaankaree nahin he hamaare paas
 On the 32nd, these farmers demonstrated wearing saris
 dhyaan rakhie- laash bane, nirvastr hue, moonche muda lee or ab sari pahanakar pradarshan karne lage
 These farmers said that a farmer took a loan by pledging his wife's Mangalsutra
 lone nahin chukaa paaya to sahuukaar mangalsutra le gaya
 The farmers repeated this scene at Jantar Mantar
 dhaage ke mangal sutara pahanakar pradarshan karne lage
 According to the media report, the government of the state has waived debts of Rs 5,780 crore taken from the cooperative banks of the state
 hoicourt ne bhi kaha he ki tamilnadu ke kisaanon kaa karz maaf hona chahie
 This time Tamil Nadu has received the lowest rainfall in the last 140 years
 pichley saal yahaan 170 millimetre barish hui jabaki ausatan 437 millimetre barish hoti he
 There are many districts where there has been 60 percent less rainfall
 rajya ke kai ilaakon main pani kaa sankat he
 80% of the farmers are small farmers
 tamilnadu main aapane suna hoga ki sasta khaanaa diya ja rahaa he
 The farmers are also provided grain at cheaper rates
 iske baad bhi kisaan aatmahatya kyon kar rahe hai
 Because the debt burden has crossed their limit
 34 wein din kisaan aurat ban gaye, chuudi todakar pradarshan karne lage
 On the 37th, the farmers wore tattered kurtas
 pagal ban gaye
 Now they started performing madly
 tippaniyan You can say that there is extremism, bizarre in these demonstrations of farmers, but also see how the common farmer is fighting about his words
 ladane ke liye kin-kin tareekon ko ijad kar rahaa he
 His house is settled at Jantar Mantar
 maang puri hone tak jane vaale nahin hai isliye vahiin raat bitaate hai, vahiin khaanaa banaate hai
 People from around are also coming to help
 koi aarthik madad kar rahaa he to koi naitik madad de rahaa he
 But there is no loud noise in their performances
 netaa mantri gaye hai magar jane kii aupchaarikta darj ho, utane bhar ke liye gaye hai
 The farmers are trapped in the Chakravyuh
 aisa nahin he ki sarkarein kuch nahin karti hai lekin unka karnaa kaaphi nahin he
 The creativity shown by the farmers makes them understand their uneasiness
 kuch log ninda bhi kar rahe honge ki itnaa atvaad kyon
 Many times compassion should be shown
 samajhane kii koshish kerani chahie ki kyon koi munh main chuha dabaa rahaa he, zamin par daal-bhaat bichhaakar kha rahaa he
 What does he want to say, what does he want to get
 aisi hi zid or rachanaatmakataa chahie kisaanon ko apni samasya se nikalne ke liye
 Also for demonstration and to change the way of farming
 
 
 
 The same emphasis would have to be made to get out of the cycle of expensive farming
 
 
 40 din se ye jantar mantar par pradarshan kar rahe hai
 134 farmers came, many of whom fell back after falling ill, but from there a new batch of hundred farmers is coming to Delhi soon
 hamane sochaa ki kyon na inke pradarshnon kii ek suchi banaate hai
 Let us see what they do as the days go by
 apni ladaai ko praasangik or rochak banaae rakhana bhi mul sangharsh se zyaada bada sangharsh he
 Among these farmers, there is also a young man of 25 years and an old farmer of 75 years
 hamane 17 march ke prime time main inke pradarshan ko shaamil kiya tha
 The next day two farmers climbed the tree and tried to hang it, but the police stopped the incident in time
 tisare din inkaa pradarshan kuch or ho gaya
 The peasants took off their clothes and covered the body with leaves
 chauthe din puure sharir ko paint kar liya
 On the sixth day, he started performing a garland of Rudraksha
 saatven, aathven or naunve din inhone kuch alag nahin kiya
 Jantar continued to perform at Mantar
 10 wein din supreme court tak langot main padayatra kii, 11 wein din jantar mantar par kutta ban gaye or bhaunkkar pradarshan karne lage
 On the 12th day, a farmer became a corpse, the peasants sat around the corpse and started ringing, crying, and also took out the funeral procession of the corpse made of the corpse
 13 wein din ro-rokar pradarshan karne lage
 Went to 14th Delhi railway station and took rats from there
 aap kalpana kiijie, patariyon par daudte chuhon ko pakadana or unhen lekar aana or phir daant se dabaanaa
 What would have been easier? Would it have been just his theatricality? There are other ways to be dramatic, why would anyone catch a mouse? On the 15th day he did a play
 tamaam mantriyon ke daftar bhi gaye, tamilnadu se modi sarkaar main mantri bhi aae, rahul gandhi bhi gaye or bahut se saamaanya log bhi gaye
 But more than coming, they are more interested in getting their point heard
 inkaa kahana he ki kuch ho jaae, dilli se ladaai jitkar jaaenge
 They say that if the government will sit in the train, then they will pull the chain, but even then they will not get off, then they will jump from the moving train
 ab to in kisaanon kaa kahana he ki ve peshaab pine ja rahe hai
 Not only this, he also played a play on Jantar Mantar
 isamen pradhanmantri ko chaabuk maarthe hue dikhaaya gaya or kisaan gandhi kaa mukhauta pahanakar zamin par kodaa khate rahe or madad maangate rahe
 It was the 15th day of his performance
 ham kah sakate hai ki inkaa pradarshan vicitra hota ja rahaa he
 But when did we all imagine the performance in this way
 lekin ek baat yaad rakhiegaa
 Event managers sitting at a contract for lakhs of leaders will create their own ideas
 ab ve kisi sarkaar yaa raajnneetik dal ke khilaaf pradarshan karenge to isi tarah rose-rose idia nikaalenge
 We will do strange things and turn them into events
 abhi aapako lag rahaa he ki inke pradarshan par kisi kaa dhyaan nahin he, magar jaldi hi koi inke pradarshan se nayaa idia nikaalane vaala he
 Ate snake meat on 16th day
 tamilnadu se saanp laayaa gaya tha
 Covered the head and eyes with a black cloth on the 17th day
 18 wein din katoraa lekar bhikhaari ban gaye
 On the 19th day, shaved half the head and half the mustache
 21 wein din puri moonch saaf kar di or 22 wein din kisaanon ke sar ke bal khadey ho gaye
 The movement is led by a 70-year-old lawyer
 inkaa kahana he ki ye pichley saal bhi dilli aae the
 The farmers of Tamil Nadu were told the plight but nobody cared
 ve zarur dilli main pradarshan kar rahe hai magar tamilnadu kii raajnneetik gatividhiyon ko dekhakar nahin lagata ki vahaan ke vidhayakon yaa sarkaar ko kisaanon kii chintaa he
 Now the 23rd day had arrived
 inkaa pradarshan kuch or rup le chukaa tha
 On the 24th, these farmers covered themselves with cloth
 25 wein din ek aadmi pradhanmantri ban gaya or kisaan apni hatheli katkar khun unke charnon main arpit karne laga
 Hunger strike on 26th day
 27 wein din gale main faansee daalkar pradarshan karne lage
 His performance on the 28th and 29th was shocking
 kisi ne kalpana nahin kii thi ki pradhanmantri karyaalay main apana gyaapan dekar lautate vakt ye nirvastr ho jaaenge or pradarshan karne lagenge
 As the days passed the stubbornness of these farmers increased
 chalis hazaar karod kii madad raashi kii maang he inaki
 It is difficult for any government

 Event managers sitting at a contract for lakhs of leaders will create their own ideas
 ab ve kisi sarkaar yaa raajnneetik dal ke khilaaf pradarshan karenge to isi tarah rose-rose idia nikaalenge
 We will do strange things and turn them into events
 abhi aapako lag rahaa he ki inke pradarshan par kisi kaa dhyaan nahin he, magar jaldi hi koi inke pradarshan se nayaa idia nikaalane vaala he
 Ate snake meat on 16th day
 tamilnadu se saanp laayaa gaya tha
 Covered the head and eyes with a black cloth on the 17th day
 18 wein din katoraa lekar bhikhaari ban gaye
 On the 19th day, shaved half the head and half the mustache
 21 wein din puri moonch saaf kar di or 22 wein din kisaanon ke sar ke bal khadey ho gaye
 The movement is led by a 70-year-old lawyer
 inkaa kahana he ki ye pichley saal bhi dilli aae the
 The farmers of Tamil Nadu were told the plight but nobody cared
 ve zarur dilli main pradarshan kar rahe hai magar tamilnadu kii raajnneetik gatividhiyon ko dekhakar nahin lagata ki vahaan ke vidhayakon yaa sarkaar ko kisaanon kii chintaa he
 Now the 23rd day had arrived
 inkaa pradarshan kuch or rup le chukaa tha
 On the 24th, these farmers covered themselves with cloth
 25 wein din ek aadmi pradhanmantri ban gaya or kisaan apni hatheli katkar khun unke charnon main arpit karne laga
 Hunger strike on 26th day
 27 wein din gale main faansee daalkar pradarshan karne lage
 His performance on the 28th and 29th was shocking
 kisi ne kalpana nahin kii thi ki pradhanmantri karyaalay main apana gyaapan dekar lautate vakt ye nirvastr ho jaaenge or pradarshan karne lagenge
 As the days passed the stubbornness of these farmers increased
 chalis hazaar karod kii madad raashi kii maang he inaki
 It is difficult for any government
 centre sarkaar ne bhi 2000 karod se adhik kii madad kaa elaan to kiya hi he magar chalis hazaar karod vah de sakegi, ham andaaza to kar hi sakate hai
 What he did on the 29th was even more difficult
 khuli sadak par chaaval ko chadar kii tarah bicha diya
 Put dal on it and started eating
 aap or ham kabhi is tarah se nahin kha sakate, kisi duusare ko khate dekh bhi nahin sakate
 On the 30th day, he wrote a demand on the chest and back of the body he had changed into language
 blike board ban gaye
 We do not have information on the 31st day
 32 wein din in kisaanon ne sari pahanakar pradarshan kiya
 Keep in mind - dead bodies were made, nude, mustache turned and now started wearing saris
 in kisaanon ne bataaya ki ek kisaan ne patni kaa mangalsutra girvee rakhkar karz liya tha
 If he could not repay the loan, the moneylender took Mangalasutra
 is seen ko kisaanon ne jantar mantar par doharaaya
 Wearing thread threads started to perform
 media report ke anusaar rajya ke sahakaarita bainkon se liye gaye 5,780 karod ke karz vahaan kii sarkaar ne maaf kar die hai
 The High Court has also said that the debt of the farmers of Tamil Nadu should be waived
 is baar tamilnadu main pichley 140 saal main sabase kam barish hui he
 Last year, it received 170 mm of rainfall, while the average rainfall is 437 mm
 kai zile aise hai jahaan 60 fisadi kam barish hui he
 There is a water crisis in many areas of the state
 80 fisadi kisaan, chote kisaan hai
 You may have heard in Tamil Nadu that cheap food is being given
 kisaanon ko sasti daron par anaaj bhi diya jaataa he
 Why farmers are committing suicide even after this
 kyonki karz kaa boj unki seemaa ko paar kar gaya he
 On the 34th day the peasants became women, broke the bangle and began to perform
 37 wein din kisaanon ne fata hua kurta pahan liya
 Became crazy
 ve ab pagal banakar pradarshan karne lage
 The comments aap kah sakate hai ki kisaanon ke in pradarshnon main atvaad he, vicitra bhi hai, lekin yah bhi to dekhie ki aam kisaan apni baat ko lekar kaise lard rahaa he
 What methods are being devised to fight
 jantar mantar par hi unka ghar bas gaya he
 We are not going to leave till the demand is met, so spend the night there, cook there
 aasapaas se log madad bhi karne aa rahe hai
 Someone is giving financial help and some is giving moral help
 lekin inke pradarshnon main koi jor shor se shaamil nahin he
 The leaders have gone to the minister, but the formalities of going have been recorded, they have been filled
 kisaan chakravyuuh main fanse hai
 It is not that governments do nothing but they do not do enough
 kisaanon ne jo rachanaatmakataa dikhaai he usase unki bechaini samaj main aati he
 Some people will also be condemning why so much extremism
 kai baar karunaa dikhaani chahie
 One should try to understand why someone is pressing a mouse in their mouth, eating pulses and rice on the ground
 wo kya kahana chahta he, kya paanaa chahta he
 Farmers need similar stubbornness and creativity to overcome their problems
 pradarshan ke liye bhi or kheti ke taur tareeke badal dene ke liye bhi
 
 
 
 aisa hi jor lagaana hoga mahangi kheti ke chakra se nikalne ke liye
 
 
 All ministers' offices were also visited, ministers from Tamil Nadu came in Modi government, Rahul Gandhi also went and many ordinary people also went
 magar aane jane se zyaada inaki dilchaspee apni baat manwaane main he
 They say that if something happens, they will win the battle from Delhi
 inkaa kahana he ki agar sarkaar train main bitha degi to chen khinch denge, phir bhi utarane nahin degi to chalati train se kud jaaenge
 Now these farmers say that they are going to drink urine
 yahi nahin unhone jantar mantar par ek naatak bhi khelaa
 In it, the Prime Minister was shown whipping and the farmers kept whip on the ground wearing Gandhi's mask and asking for help
 yah unke pradarshan kaa 15 waan din tha
 We can say that their performance is becoming bizarre
 lekin is tarah se pradarshan kii kalpana ham sabane kab kii thi
 But remember one thing
 netaaon ke yahaan lakhon kaa theka lekar baithe event manager isse kuch apana idia banaaenge
 Now they will protest against any government or political party, then they will come out with the idea everyday
 vicitra-vicitra harakatein karenge or event main badal denge
 Right now you feel that their performance is unnoticed, but soon someone is going to remove a new idea from their performance
 16 wein din saanp kaa maance khaaya
 The snake was brought from Tamil Nadu
 17 wein din kaale kapade se sar or aankh ko dhank liya
 On the 18th day he became a beggar with a bowl
 19 wein din aadha sar or aadhi moonch mundava lee
 On the 21st day, he cleaned his mustache and on the 22nd, he stood on the head of the farmers
 is andolan kaa netritv 70 saal ke ek vakil kar rahe hai
 They say that they came to Delhi last year too
 tamilnadu ke kisaanon kii vyathaa bataai thi magar kisi ne parvaah nahin kii
 They are definitely protesting in Delhi, but seeing the political activities of Tamil Nadu, they do not think that the legislators or the government there are concerned about the farmers
 ab 23 waan din aa chukaa tha
 Their performance had taken some other form
 24 wein din in kisaanon ne kapade se khud ko dhank liya
 On the 25th day a man became the Prime Minister and the farmer cut his palm and offered blood at his feet
 26 wein din bhukh hadtaal kii
 On the 27th, they began to protest by hanging them in the neck
 28 wein or 29 wein din inkaa pradarshan jhajhakor dene vaala rahaa
 Nobody had imagined that they would go naked and start demonstrating while returning their memorandum to the Prime Minister's Office
 jaise-jaise din gujara in kisaanon kii zid badhati gai
 They are in need of help of forty thousand crores
 kisi bhi sarkaar ke liye mushkil he
 The central government has also announced the help of more than 2000 crores, but it will be able to give forty thousand crores, we can only guess
 29 wein din inhone jo kiya wo or bhi mushkil tha
 Spreaded the rice like a sheet on the open road
 us par daal daalkar khaane lage
 You and we can never eat like this, cannot even see someone else eating
 30 wein din unhone jis sharir ko bhashaa main badla tha, usee kii chaati or peeth par maang likh di
 Blacks became boards
 31 wein din kii jaankaree nahin he hamaare paas
 On the 32nd, these farmers demonstrated wearing saris
 dhyaan rakhie- laash bane, nirvastr hue, moonche muda lee or ab sari pahanakar pradarshan karne lage
 These farmers said that a farmer took a loan by pledging his wife's Mangalsutra
 lone nahin chukaa paaya to sahuukaar mangalsutra le gaya
 The farmers repeated this scene at Jantar Mantar
 dhaage ke mangal sutara pahanakar pradarshan karne lage
 According to the media report, the government of the state has waived debts of Rs 5,780 crore taken from the cooperative banks of the state
 hoicourt ne bhi kaha he ki tamilnadu ke kisaanon kaa karz maaf hona chahie
 This time Tamil Nadu has received the lowest rainfall in the last 140 years
 pichley saal yahaan 170 millimetre barish hui jabaki ausatan 437 millimetre barish hoti he
 There are many districts where there has been 60 percent less rainfall
 rajya ke kai ilaakon main pani kaa sankat he
 80% of the farmers are small farmers
 tamilnadu main aapane suna hoga ki sasta khaanaa diya ja rahaa he
 The farmers are also provided grain at cheaper rates
 iske baad bhi kisaan aatmahatya kyon kar rahe hai
 Because the debt burden has crossed their limit
 34 wein din kisaan aurat ban gaye, chuudi todakar pradarshan karne lage
 On the 37th, the farmers wore tattered kurtas
 pagal ban gaye
 Now they started performing madly
 tippaniyan You can say that there is extremism, bizarre in these demonstrations of farmers, but also see how the common farmer is fighting about his words
 ladane ke liye kin-kin tareekon ko ijad kar rahaa he
 His house is settled at Jantar Mantar
 maang puri hone tak jane vaale nahin hai isliye vahiin raat bitaate hai, vahiin khaanaa banaate hai
 People from around are also coming to help
 koi aarthik madad kar rahaa he to koi naitik madad de rahaa he
 But there is no loud noise in their performances
 netaa mantri gaye hai magar jane kii aupchaarikta darj ho, utane bhar ke liye gaye hai
 The farmers are trapped in the Chakravyuh
 aisa nahin he ki sarkarein kuch nahin karti hai lekin unka karnaa kaaphi nahin he
 The creativity shown by the farmers makes them understand their uneasiness
 kuch log ninda bhi kar rahe honge ki itnaa atvaad kyon
 Many times compassion should be shown
 samajhane kii koshish kerani chahie ki kyon koi munh main chuha dabaa rahaa he, zamin par daal-bhaat bichhaakar kha rahaa he
 What does he want to say, what does he want to get
 aisi hi zid or rachanaatmakataa chahie kisaanon ko apni samasya se nikalne ke liye
 Also for demonstration and to change the way of farming
 
 
 
 The same emphasis would have to be made to get out of the cycle of expensive farming

 While sending all petitions challenging the acquisition of land in Noida and Greater Noida to a larger bench for hearing, the Allahabad High Court said that the Uttar Pradesh government will have to answer that when it takes years to start work in the area Then why did she continue to acquire land by applying emergency provisions again and again
 gautamabuddha nagar ke kareeb ek darjan gaanvon main uttar pradesh sarkaar dwaara 3,000 hectare se adhik bhoomi adhigrahan ko chunauti dene vaale saikadon kisaanon kii yachikaaon par sunwaayee karte hue nyaayamurti amitaav lala or nyaayamurti ashok shrivastav kii peeth ne kisaanon ko 12 agast tak adaalat se baahar maamla nipataane kaa bhi vikalp diya
 "we see that the state government has repeatedly used the emergency provision for land acquisition in the area," the bench said
 nyaayalay yah jaananaa chahega ki aisa karne ke peeche kya vajah rahi
 The court wondered, why it takes months, sometimes years for the state government to start work on the acquired land, while it acquires land as a state of emergency and the landowners are not even given a chance to raise objections
 
 iske alaava, nyaayalay ne bhoomi ke istemaal ke uddeshy main badlaav par bhi rajya sarkaar se jawaab maanga he
 After the land is acquired for the purpose of industrial development, why the nature of the land is changed and handed over to the builders

 Input: IANS america ne das saal pehle iraq par jo hamalaa kiya uske peeche kai vajahen bataai jaati hai
 It may be, but it is also true that if there was no oil there, America would not have gone there
 or das saal pehle jis liye america ne iraq par hamalaa kiya tha, kya vah tel ab al kaayda ke haathon main jane vaala he
 The terrorist organization ISIS captured the largest oil refinery in the country in Baghdad's first Baizi
 kya iraq main abhi bhi ye tamaasha isi tel kaa he? yaa yah shiya-sunni takaraav he yaa phir is takaraav ke peeche bhi darasal saudi arab or iraan ke apane kshetriy mansoobey hai? America does not want to impose yet another war on its head, but it cannot ignore Iraq
 in sab sawaalon ke bich america ke videsh mantri jon kerri iraq main ek sankat kaa ek siyaasi hal nikaalane kii koshish main hai
 Iraq is going through its most difficult phase since the us-imposed war
 pradhanmantri al maliki shiya hai, jo kattarpanthi unke khilaaf khadey hai vah sunni samudaay ke wahabi gut ke log hai
 Al Maliki is being appealed to rise above the shia-sunni spirit to form a government that will take everyone along
 iesas kaa mishan he ki iraq or syria ke sunni ilaakon main islamic state kaayam karnaa
 Mosul, Iraq's second major city, is occupied by ISIS
 haalanki iraqi sena kaa kahana he ki vah jaanboojh kar kuch jagahon se peeche hat gaye hai
 Meanwhile, after Kerry's visit, it is clear that America's presence in Iraq will increase
 lagbhag 300 america military salaahkaar iraq main pahunchenge
 But Obama is not ready to take more risk than this
 obama kaa bayaan aayaa he ki iraqi netaaon ko hi apane kshetriy mansoobon se upar uthakar iskaa hal dhundhana hoga, varanaa koi sainik hal mushkil he
 There are many theories about this Iraq problem
 iraq yuddh par kitaab likhane vaale british akhbaar 'di independent' ke puvar patrkaar justin hagaller kehete hai ki iraq yudd hameshaa se tel ko lekar he
 The ISIS boys also first occupied the country's largest refinaki, as did the Americans
 saal 2003 main jab baghdad main koharaam machaa tha, to bhi amarikiyon ne tel mantralay ko sabase pehle mahfuj kiya tha, kyonki tel hi power he
 Many experts say that America may have invaded Iraq for many reasons, but if there was no oil there, America would not have gone there
 iran, iraq or saudi arab mil kar duniya kaa sabase bada tel rigerv control karte hai
 What is happening in Iraq is a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran
 saudi paison par fal phool rahaa he sunni aatankwaad iesas or iraan kaa samarthan he iraq kii shiya sarkaar or shiya ladaakon ko

 In September last year, the CBI arrested former Odisha High Co judge IM Kudusi on charges that he was conspiring to bribe and influence some top judges of the Supreme Court and Allahabad High Court
 is maamle main yachika daakhil karne vaale varisht vakil prashanth bhushan ne is tepe kii ek swatantra or paardarshee tareeke se jaanch kii maang kii he
 One reason for the resentment of the four judges is that this case of medical admissions scam is currently in the Supreme Court and this issue is also a reason for showing rebellion of four senior judges against CJI Deepak Mishra
 justise je chelmeshwar ne is kathith ghotaale kii sunwaayee ke liye ek sanvaidhanik bench banane kaa aadesh diya tha, lekin november maah main CJI mishra ne is aadesh ko palat diya
 People complaining about the matter are now circulating transcripts of the conversation which reveal that Odisha High Court retired Justice Kudusi tried to influence the judges in the admission scam
 is transcript ke mutabik kuddusi ne lakhanu ke prasad ajukeshan trust or saharanpur ke glocal medical college ke paksh main aadesh dilaane ke liye supreme court ke jajon ko set karne kaa prayaas kiya
 Both these colleges were accused of going against the government rules and giving admission
 sitambar main apni giraftaar se pehle purv justise kuddusi ko medical collejon ke dalal vishwanath agarwal or prasad ajukeshan trust ke beepi yadav se dling karte hue pakadaa gaya
 In their conversation taped with the phone, they are talking in code word and telling the Supreme Court or Allahabad High Court to be a temple
 is baatcheet main agarwal poochta he, 'yah koun se mandir main he
 In Allahabad or Delhi Temple? ' In response to this, Kudusi says, 'no, it is not in any temple yet, but it will go
 'agarwal kathith rup se is ghoosekhori main ek 'captain' ke shaamil hone kii baat karata he
 He says, 'yes, yes, you will see one thing in it, 100 percent, this matter will be seen by our captain only
 to samasya kya he, mujhe bataaie?' shikayatakartaaon kaa kahana he ki sitambar main hui yah baatcheet medical collejon par admician bain kaa ulanghan karne par sarkari karrwai ke khilaaf unke supreme court main apil se hi judaa he
 In this conversation, the broker Agarwal expresses concern that the government of 'chaiwala' is vigorously keeping watch over corruption
 agarwal kahata he, 'lages pehle hi dena hoga or vah meeting ke liye taiyaar nahin hai kyonki yah chaiwale kii sarkaar he
 This is the problem, keeping an eye on everything
 'donon ghoose ke bare main khulkar baat karte hai
 Retired Justice Kudussi asks, 'how much advance will you get? ' iskaa jawaab miltaa he, 'unhone to us samay kaha tha ki rivyuu petishan ke liye 100 logon ko dena hoga
 If a review is allowed, you will be told
 somvaar ko ham tay karenge
 They give us 2 to 2
 5 tak saamaan denge, koi samasya nahin
 Among those arrested by the CBI last year in this scam were retired Justice Ishrat Masroor Kudduci, besides middleman Vishwanath Agarwal, private medical college owner B

 vahiin jab 28 may ko mausam vibhaag kii bhavishyavaanee sahi baithi to 29 may ko share bazaar main aisi companiyon ke sheyaron main kargar oochaal darj hui
 It is now expected that after the meteorological department's prediction of the normal monsoon is completely accurate, the biggest relief of the current financial year is going to be given to the Modi government

 In fact, the Meteorological Department had predicted on April 16 last month that the monsoon will not disappoint this year and different regions of the country will get good rainfall for four consecutive months
 mausam vibhaag kaa anumaan he ki saamaanya monsoon or samay se pehle aayaa monsoon is saal kharif fasal ke liye vardaan sabit hoga or iske saath hi desh kii arthvyavastha ko majboot karne kaa kaam karegaa

 Learn how PM Modi will be strong before the elections: Good days of farmers: doubling of income and agricultural experts say that a normal and good monsoon increases the income of farmers, which increases the purchasing power in rural areas of the country
 monsoon ke samay se pehle aagaman par desh main kisaanon ko chaaval, ganna, makka, kapaas or soyabean jaise ahm cash crop kii buaai ko praathamikta dene main madad milti he
 At the same time, under normal monsoon, this crop increases the income of farmers with good yield

 Significantly, in 2015, after the normal monsoon, farmers faced drought conditions for two consecutive years
 aise main acha monsoon kisaanon kaa acha din laane ja rahaa he or kharif kii acchhee paidaavaar ne aamadani main kargar ijapha kiya to aam chunaavon main phaayde kii kataai modi sarkaar karegi
 Factories will get lifeline, demand will increase in the country, good yield in rural areas increases the purchasing power of farmers
 kisaanon ke liye yah monsoon ahm he to is monsoon ke dauraan hone vaali kharif kheti unki vaarshik aamadani ke pramukh jariya he
 With the help of this farming, sales of products like gold, cars, motorcycles, tractors, tvs, fridges, fertilizers etc
 are also increasing in rural areas

 The Reserve Bank has argued that inflation is expected to increase in the country due to weak monsoon
 aise main byaaj daron main katautee se mahangaai bekaabu hone kaa dar rahata he
 Therefore, this time due to the good monsoon, this argument of the central bank will be weakened and economic experts claim that the path to cut interest rates will be cleared after the good monsoon
 byaaj daron main katauteese desh main kaarobaari gatividhia tej hone kii majboot paristhiti banati he or nijee kshetra se nivesh kii sambhaavnaaon main ijapha ho jaataa he
 With all these effects, inflation in the country is also controlled
