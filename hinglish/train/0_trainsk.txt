 jane-maane nirdeshak imtiyaaj ali kii charchit film 'haive' kaa somvaar ko pehle poster relies hua or uske kuch der baad hi pehla oficial trailor bhi launch kar diya gaya
 Two posters of the film were released
 is film main mukhya bhoomikaaon main bhatta camp ke chahete randeep hooda ke saath mahesh bhatta kii beti aalia bhatta najar aaengi
 Sajid Nadiadwala and UTV Motion Pictures are the producers of this film
 film 'haive' 21 farvari, 2014 ko relies hogi
 The film has music by Oscar Award winner AR Rahman
 aapako bataa den ki yah film aalia bhatta kii duusari film he
 Earlier she appeared in Karan Johar's film 'student of the Year'
 haalanki aalia or randeep ne is film ke bare main zyada kuch nahin bataaya he
 But in this film, Alia looks quite different from 'student of the Year'
 film kaa promo dekhakar kuch had tak sthiti saaf hoti he
 It is seen that the way Imtiaz has been giving importance to female characters in his films, it is seen in the same way
 2005 main 'sochaa naa tha' se film nirdesan kii shuruyaat karne vaale imtiyaaj ali apni filmon main yatra ko kaaphi ahmiyat dete hai
 In the film Rockstar too, he gave a lot of attention to this

 The recent three Lok Sabha and two assembly by-elections have disappointed the saffron party
 sabase karaara jhatka to use rajasthan kii do loksabhaa or ek vidhansabha seat par mila, jisase ubarne main use kaaphi kuch karne kii jarurat hogi
 It is comforting for her that in the Uluberia parliamentary and Noapara assembly by-elections in West Bengal, she defeated the CPI-M and the Congress to finish second
 haalanki in donon par trinmul congress kii jeet itani baari he ki bhaajapa chaahakar bhi jashn manaane kii sthiti main nahin ho sakati
 4 difference of Trinamool victory in Uluberia
 74 lakh he or noapada main 63,000 rahaa he
 The Congress has definitely got a chance to celebrate
 usne ajmer or alvar kii loksabhaa siten or mandalgarh kii vidhansabha seat jitkar rajasthan main hue upachunaavon kii teenon siten apni jholii main daal leen
 The three Congress candidates Raghu Sharma, Karan Singh Yadav and Vivek Dhakad won by getting a total of over seven lakh votes
 pichley chunaav main ye teenon siten bhaajapa ke khate main thim
 But this time BJP could not register an edge in even one of these 17 assembly constituencies
 isse agar congress ke netaa rajya main vaapasi kaa khwab dekhne lage hai to unhen iskaa haq he
 These results have confirmed the position of state Congress president Sachin Pilot and now he will lead the party in the next assembly elections
 purv mukhyamantri ashok gahalot salaahkaar kii bhoomika nibhaate rahenge, kyonki party ko unke tajurbe kii bhi jarurat he
 On the other hand, Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje will have to bring tremendous changes in her working style
 saath hi, unhen mantrimandal main bhi baari pherbadal karnaa hoga or kuch diggaj mantriyon ko hataakar jamini kaam karne ke liye bhejnaa hoga
 Although the state BJP is blaming the demonetisation, GST and RSS for not supporting this defeat, such excuses will not help in improving the performance of the party in the assembly elections
 vaise, yah tay he ki raaje ko phir se vaise hi sakriy hona chahie jaise ve pichley teen saal ke dauraan thim
 They should meet and talk with party workers and common people and make sure that their orders are implemented
 vajah jo bhi ho, ve kushal prashaasak kii apni chhavi ganvaa chuki hai
 After the results, a senior officer said, "A section of the bureaucracy showed them the vegetables that could never be completed
" doosraa dhada apane main hi duba rahata he or is kadar gaiyr-siyaasi he ki use unke faislon ke asar or nattejey samaj main nahin aate
 "on the other hand, immediately after winning the election, State Congress President Sachin Pilot told India Today," i am not surprised
 loksabhaa chunaav ke fouran baad bhi hamane vidhansabha kii chaar siton main teen jiti thim
 "it's also a big deal because Pilot almost took command of the Mattiamat Party
 unhone pichley chaar saal main chote-chote kadamon se party ko nae sire se khadaa kiya he
 Hardly any Congress leader would have worked so hard to establish himself
 jatigat samikarnon ne bhi payalat ke haq main kaam kiya
 The pilot's decision to field veteran leader Karan Singh Yadav on the Yadav-dominated seat worked
 iske alaava congress ko mev musalamaanon kaa bhi samarthan mila, jinhen is ilaake main bhaajapa kii goraksha brigade ne nishaanaa banaaya he
 In Ajmer too, the pilot's decision to field Raghu Sharma of the bjp's Brahmin votes was successful
 apane sahyogi sharma ke liye gahalot ne kadi mehnat kii
 The most surprising thing for the Congress itself is the victory of Mandalgarh
 haalanki yah seat congress kaa paaramparik garh rahi he, par party ke ek baagi netaa ke maidan main utarane ke baad ise haara hua maan liya gaya tha
 The pilot continued to hurt the government's flaws and raised issues such as farmer suicides, poor public facilities and religious intolerance
 ve kaamyaab bhi rahe
 Gehlot reminded the party workers that if the party can do so well in Gujarat, it can also do in Rajasthan
 vahiin, bhaajapa kaa koi pasa is baar muafic nahin padaa

 In the book, he is also accused of raping black money and accused of depositing abroad

 a bike rider who came to fill petrol at the petrol pump of Mayur Vihar here said that the condition is very bad

 Similarly, another bike rider said that the Kejriwal government should also reduce the price
 unhone ise dilli sarkaar kii sabase badi naakaami qaraar diya
 a bike rider who came to Noida's petrol pump to fill petrol said that the price should be reduced in Delhi too
 vahiin ek duusare bike savaar ne kaha ki 5 rupye se kuch nahin hoga
 The government should reduce the price of petrol and diesel by at least Rs 10

 Loknath Mahato and his wife Molani Devi, a former MLA from Hazaribagh's Barkaagaon and presently the Hazaribagh parliamentary constituency, is an example who has kept gandhi-lohia's dreams alive till today
 inaki patni sir par tokari rakh sabji lekar paidal gaanv ke bazaar jaati or sabji bechatin hai
 Her husband Loknath Mahato has been an MLA from Barkagaon on BJP ticket for three consecutive times from 1995 to 2010
 philhal lokanath mahato ajasu pratyaashee ke taur par hazaribagh loksabhaa kshetra se bhagya aajamaa rahe hai
 While Loknath is sweating in the field of politics, his wife is working hard in the fields
 vah aaj bhi apane kheton main ugaai subjiyan lekar bazaar main bechney jaati hai
 Like a common wife, he too has his legitimate complaints that the MLA does not pay attention at home, instead he keeps busy in the service of common people day and night
 molni devi kaa kahana he ki pehle unki saas yah kaam karti thi, ab wo is parampara ko aage badha rahi hai
 It is not that there is a shortage of money at home
 inke paas kareeb 10 acre khetiyogy jameen he, jinamein dhan, gehun, aalu, pyaaj jaisi fasalein ugaai jaati hai

 There was an uproar in the Lok Sabha on Thursday on the triple talaq bill
 AIMIM netaa or saansad asaduddin ovaisi ne kaha ki bill main aap kah rahe hai ki agar kisi pati ne patni ko teen baar talaak kah diya to shaadi nahin tuutati, supreme court kaa faisla bhi yahi kahata he phir aap ye kyon kar rahe hai
 He said that it is against women
 jab 3 saal kii sajaa ho jaae,pati jail main rahe to aurat 3 saal takintjaar karen
 And when he came back after 3 years, what should he say that my lover has come out to show me the flowers? ovaisi ne kaha kiap ek praavdhaan laiyeki agar koi tripal talaak detaa he to meher kii rakam kaa 5guna use bharna pade
 At the same time, Congress MP Gaurav Gogoi said that the triple talaq bill asked whether the demand of sending the bill to the Standing Committee also turned against Muslim women
 aap muslim sanghathanon se salaah mashwara kiijie
 Sit with them agar aapako sabakaa saath sabakaa vishwaas chahie to aap supreme court ke aadeshaanusaar mob linching par lau lie
 Let me tell you that earlier, Law and Justice Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, while describing gender justice as the core of the Narendra Modi government, said that the bill to ban triple talaq is not a question of politics, religion, community but it is "respect for woman" And there is the question of 'women's justice' and everyone should support this initiative to protect the rights of daughters of Hindustan
 ravishankar prasad ne loksabhaa main ‘muslim mahila (vivaah adhikaar sangrakshan) vidheyak 2019' ko charchaa evam paarit karne ke liye pesh kiya jisamen vivaahit muslim mahilaon ke adhikaron kii sangraksha karne or unke patiyon dwaara teen baar talaak bolkar vivaah todane ko nishedh karne kaa praavdhaan kiya gaya he
 RSP KN NK Premachandran, opposing the introduction of the bill for discussion and passage, moved a statutory resolution against the ordinance brought by the government in February in this regard
 premuchandran ne kaha ki is vidheyak ko bhaajapa sarkaar lakshith agenda ke rup main laai he
 It is political

 Sri Lanka continued their winning streak in the tournament with a century of opener Lahiru Thirimane (101 runs) and Lasith Malinga (five wickets for 56 runs) defeating Pakistan by five wickets in the final of the five-nation tournament here on Saturday Asia Cup held its name
 gat champion pakistan ne malinga ke jhatkon se ubarte hue favad alam (naabad 114) ke pehle vanade shatak se paanch wicket par 260 ran kaa sammanjanak score khadaa kiya, lekin alam kaa saikadaa team ke kaam nahin aa sakaa
 The Sri Lankan team, chasing this target, achieved this target thanks to a 156-run partnership for the third wicket of Thirimane and former captain Mahela Jayawardene (75) by scoring 261 for five wickets with 22 balls
 toornament ke shuruaati mukaable main pakistan ko shikast dene vaali srilanka kaa yah paanchvaan asia cap khitaab tha, pichhali baar unhone 2008 main yah kshetreey toornament jeeta tha
 Sri Lanka started well, but spinner Saeed Ajmal sent Kushal Perera (42) and Kumar Sangakkara (00) to the pavilion in consecutive balls in the 11th over
 lekin jayavardhane ne samay par farm main vaapasi karte hue thirimane ke saath shandaar shatkeey saajhedaari nibhaai jisase team jeet ke kareeb pahunch gai
 Thirimane scored 101, his third ODI century
 isamen unhone 108 gendon kaa saamana kiya or 13 chauke jamaaye
 He was also bowled by Ajmal with his second
 haalanki tab srilankai team jeet se keval 14 ran dur thi
 Jayawardene made his first useful contribution for Sri Lanka in the tournament and there could not have been a better time for it
 mohammad hafeez ne umr gul kii gend par unka kaich chhod diya tha, tab vah 52 ran par the
 But in an attempt to put a big shot on the ball of Mohammad Talha, he was caught by catching Sharjeel Khan
 jayavardhane ne 93 gend main 10 chauke or ek chakke se 75 ran banaae
 Pakistan also gave life to 'player of the Series' Thirimane, when he was on 36 runs
 wicketiper umr akmal ne unka kaich choda tha
 Pakistan once again took a surprise decision, removing their main weapon Ajmal from the attack in the 15th over
 phir vah 27wein over main laute, lekin tab tak bahut der ho gayi thi kyonki thirimane tab tak 63 gend main 64 ran bana chuke the or jayavardhane bhi 55 gend main chaar chauke or ek chakke se 40 ran banaakar khel rahe the
 It was from here that the Pakistani team lost the match, after this nothing was in their favor
 unhone lachar kshetrarakshan karte hue kai kaich chode
 Before winning the toss, the Pakistani team battled losing three wickets for 18 as 'man of the match' Malinga (five wickets for 56 runs) destroyed the top order but Alam captain captain Misbah ul Haq and Two century partnerships with Umar Akmal, respectively, helped the team to score
 alam ne naabad 114 ran ke liye 134 gend kaa saamana karte hue aath chauke or teen chakke jade
 In this way he scored the first ODI century in 29 matches, when 4
 3 over main score teen wicket par 18 ran tha, unhone misbah (98 gend main teen chauke or do chakke se 65 ran) ke saath 122 ran kii bhagidaari nibhaakar pakistan ko ubarne main madad kii
 Alam got life on 92, when Chaturanga de Silva gave up his catch at midwicket
 unhone 91 gend main lagaataar apana doosraa ardhashatak puraa kiya or phir 35 gend or khelkar 100 ran puure kiye
 He made a hundred by delivering the ball of Thisara Perera for a six over midwicket
 umr akmal (42 gend main saat chauke se 59 ran) ke rup main unhen acha saajheedaar mila, in donon ne paanchaven wicket ke liye 115 ran jode
 Akmal was dismissed for 255, leaving Shahid Afridi unable to play a single ball at the crease in the final
 lekin pakistan ko isse zyada fark nahin padaa kyonki alam kii shandaar pari ne unhen 261 ran kaa chunauteepurn score banane main madad kii
 Sri Lanka pursued a bold strategy by not choosing the mystery spinner Anjata Mendis in the playing XI
 vahiin malinga ne toornament main unke khilaaf duusari baar paanch wicket hasil kiye
 He started bowling with a new ball and Sharjil, returning after an injury, hit two fours in his first over
 lekin malinga ne aakraamak dikh rahe sharsil kaa wicket jhatka, jo teesraa chaukaa jamaane kii koshish main mid aan par perera ko kaich de baithe
 Malinga took the second and third wickets in the next two overs
 isse pakistan ke sheersh kram main sharsil, ahamed shahzad or mohammad hafeez kramash: 8, 5 or 3 ran par out ho gaye
 While Sharjeel lost the wicket in an attempt to increase the run pace, Shehzad and Hafeez returned to the pavilion on the outswinger of the Sri Lankan bowler, giving Malinga a good position in the first three overs
 malinga jahaan wicket hasil kar rahe the, lackmal ne apni raftaar se duusare chor par prabhavit kiya
 He put pressure on bowling from the right line and length
 lackmal ne paanch over ke apane pehle spel main keval 10 ran die, jisamen do madan bhi shaamil the
 One of these two maidens was against captain Misbah, who was playing cautiously, scoring 0, 1 and 4 in the last three innings
 misbah ko farm main chal rahe alam ke rup main behtareen jodidar mila, jo bangladesh ke khilaaf pichley match main apni 74 ran kii pari ke baad aatmavishvaas se bhare hue the
 Before the election, all the strategy is being prepared by the Sheila government
 janata ko ye bataane ke liye ki sarkaar ne kitna kaam kiya he, ek baar phir se report card kaa sahaara lene kii taiyaari he
 This report card will show the work of the government
 ab dekhnaa hoga ki is card main kiye ja rahe daavon par janata kitna yakeen karti he
 Chief Minister Sheila Dixit is going to bring this report card to beat the work done in her 15 years
 is report ko do bhaagon main taiyaar kiya gaya he
 The first part will show the development of Delhi and the second will show the social change happening in Delhi
 is report ke jariye shila na sirf janata ko rijhaane kii jugad main hai balki dilli main congress kaa ek maatr cheharaa shila hi hai, iskaa bhi dhyaan rakhaa gaya he
 The slogan of Sheila's report card is, "delhi's saga is unmatched, 15 years of continuous growth" This report card seeks to carve out all the pictures to improve education, environment, culture and living standards of people
 iske saath-saath aarthik samruddhi, avaidh coloniyon or punarvaas coloniyon main sarkaar ke kaamon kaa khub bakhaan kiya gaya
 In addition to its Anna Sri Yojana, the government has also termed the Food Security Act as a means to change the lives of people
 yani kul milakar shila dikshit is report card ke jariye chunaav maidan main ye kah kar utarana chaahati hai ki sarkaar apni peeth thapthapa rahi he or jarurat he to bas ye ki voter sarkaar ke sir par apana haath rakh den
 Is Priyanka Vadra Brahmastra of Rahul Gandhi, whose target is only Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)? Or is the Samajwadi Party (SP) -bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) alliance in Uttar Pradesh on the target of the Congress president? The BJP is obviously the main antagonist of the Congress, but India's politics can hardly be described in black and white
 yahaan kuch aspasht sthiti bhi he, jo doston or dushmano ke aadhaar ko dhundhala kar detii he
 There are also slight indications that the SP and BSP formed a small coalition at the state level for the upcoming Lok Sabha elections and gave only two out of 80 seats to the 134-year-old party, which is also upset with the Congress
 gathbandhan se baahar rakhane ke jatke ko kuch udaar shabdon se sahaj banane kii koshish kii gai, or uske jawaab main sapa ke akhilesh yadav ne bhi rahul gandhi ke prati 'sammaan' kaa bhav dikhaaya
 But bsp's Mayawati remained tough
 unhone isse pehle madhyapradesh or chhattisgarh main congress ke saath seat bantwaare kii baatcheet achaanak samaapt kar di thi
 Stunned by the humiliation in Uttar Pradesh, the Congress committed to contest all the 80 seats in the state
 purvi uttar pradesh ke liye priyanka wadra kii party mahasachiv ke rup main niyukti party ke atirikt prayaas se judaa ho saktaa he, jisamen congress us rajya main apni upasthiti darj karaane kii koshish karegi, jahaan vah ek dashak se apni upasthiti nahin darj kara pai he
 Apart from this, Jyotiraditya Scindia, general secretary in charge of western Uttar Pradesh, has been made
 sapa or basapa congress ke phir se punerjeevit hone se bahut khush nahin honge
 There are also slight indications that bringing the charismatic face of the family into the fray will create a new sense of excitement in the party, which the workers have been waiting for for a long time
 kya yah sargarmi jamini str par kaam karegi, jahaan sapa-basapa gathbandhan ne apane paas 75 siten rakhi hai? inamen se sapa ke paas 37, basapa ke paas 38 or rashtriya lokdal ke paas teen or congress ke liye do siten chodi gai hai
 At this time, the SP, BSP and RLD are hoping that they have unalterable support of backward castes, Jatavs and Jats
 ab ve yah ummid kar rahe honge ki punerjeevit congress bhaajapa se savarna jati kaa vot chin legi, jisase dharmanirpeksh partiyaan jatigat sameekaran ke saath jeet sunishchit kar lengi
 But it is also possible that there will be a split of votes between SP-BSP-RLD, Congress and BJP
 isse bhaajapa ko phayda ho saktaa he, agar sapa-basapa-ralod or congress ke bich muslim mat bant jaae
 Apart from this, Rahul Gandhi had said that the Congress will not play on the backfoot, which is reflected in the party's decision
 party ne andhrapradesh main telugu desham party (tedepa) or pashchim bengal main trinmul congress se gathjod nahin kiya he, jiskaa matlab he ki kuch rajyon main prayek siton par bhaajapa ke khilaaf ek 'dharmanirpeksh' ummidavaar utaarna sambhav nahin hoga
 As a result, it is easy to assess the weak impact of talk of Grand Alliance at the national level
 is lihaaj se priyanka gandhi ke raajnneeti main pravesh kaa ek asthirkaari prabhaav ho saktaa he, jo mitra jodne or logon ko prabhavit karne ke maamle main congress ke liye hameshaa laabhadaayak nahin bhi ho saktaa he
 It is believed that she will infuse a political energy into the Congress with her conversational skills and a lively and sympathetic communication skills with the crowd, which could further strengthen her brother's claim to become Prime Minister

 kumaraswami pehle hi, rahul gandhi ko dharmanirpeksh dalon kaa pradhanmantri ummidavaar banane ke dramuk netaa em

 The BJP will be pleased with this rift between secular parties
 iske saath hi bhaajapa kii sahyogi shivasena ne priyanka gandhi ke raajnneeti main pravesh ko congress ke liye 'achche din' kaha
 a Shiv Sena spokesperson, however, has reiterated the usually clear resemblance between Indira Gandhi and her granddaughter
 iske alaava ek or pravaktaa ne us 'rishte' kii baat kii, jo nehru-gandhi parivaar ke saath bharat ke logon se bana he
 The BJP relies on the eloquence of Narendra Modi, but the BJP has to be careful of Priyanka Vadra's attacks in the region
 kyonki vah is tarah kii chunauti pesh kar sakati hai, jiskaa bhaajapa ne beete saadhe chaar varsho main saamana nahin kiya he
 Apart from this, the BJP will also have to look carefully at Priyanka Vadra's art of attracting crowds to see if she can replicate the charisma of Nehru and Indira Gandhi

 Salman considers Shweta just like her real sister, then not only did he attend her wedding, but also gave her Kanyadaan
 shweta mumbai ke ek sindhi parivaar se aati hai or bachapan se hi salmaan se prabhavit hai
 Once upon a time, she reached Salman's house and told her mother that she wanted to tie a rakhi to Sallu
 phir kya tha, dariyadil salmaan ne turant hi haa bol diya or tab se ve lagaataar shweta se raakhi bandhawa rahe hai

 After becoming the new Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, BJP MP from Gorakhpur, Yogi Adityanath, who came to participate in the discussion on the Finance Bill in Parliament, took a heavy toll on the opposition leaders
 vahiin unhone uttar pradesh kii purvavarti sarkaar par bhi nishaanaa saadhaa
 However, he also received many such replies from senior leaders, which also caused a lot of laughter in the House
 yogi adityanath ne sadan main kaha, 'jab main gorkhupar se chunakar pehali baar sansad main aayaa to pehle main bahut patala tha
 On this, Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan said that 'still no one is too fat, in the same way weight has increased'
 jab surajeet singh barnaala (punjab ke purv mukhyamantri) ne mujhe pehali baar dekha to ve mujhe kareeb aadhe ghante tak dekhte rahe
 He asked me if you are from Gorakhpur, then i answered yes
 iske baad ve mujhe dobaaraa dekhte rahe
 He asked me that again and i gave the same answer
 jab unhone teesri baar yahi poocha ki aap gorakhpur se hi ho to maine kahaan haa, lekin aap aisa kyon puch rahe hai
 So he said that once i went to Gorakhpur, then there were bombs on both sides, then i immediately went there and did not go there again
 yogi adityanath ne aage kaha, 'mujhe yah baat jaanakar bahut dhakka laga hamaare shahar, jile ke bare main is tarah kii baaten kii jaati hai
 After that i held a meeting with all business, social and cultural organizations in Gorakhpur to find a solution to this problem
 aaj main kah saktaa hum ki pichley 15 saalon main hamane gorakhpur main ek bhi vyapaaree ko gunda tex nahin dene diya
 Not a single merchant-doctor was kidnapped
 ham kah sakate hai ki ab puure upi main ham aisa hi surakshit maahaul paidaa karenge
 After this, he took a jibe at Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi and former Chief Minister of UP Akhilesh Yadav
 unhone kaha ki log meri umr ke bare main kah sakate hai
 i am one year younger than Rahul Gandhi
 is par unhone loksabhaa main netaa vipaksh mallikarjun khadge kaa dhyaan aakarshith karte hue mazaaq main kaha, khadge ji, rahul ji sadan main nahin hai
 i am one year younger than Rahul Gandhi
 tippaniyan After this he targeted the Samajwadi Party and said that no one is present in the house from Mulayam Singh Yadav's party and i also want to tell that i am one year older than Akhilesh
 donon kii jodi ke bich main main aa gaya
 This can be a big reason for your failure
 yogi adityanath ke is kathan par mallikarjun khadge bhi chup nahin rahe or unhone sadan main kaha ki 'aap rahul or akhilesh ji ke bich main aa gaye, lekin ab aap vahaan ke (uttar pradesh ke) siem hai
 i congratulate you, but you manage this stand out and go ahead with the dignity of the same
 is par loksabhaa adhyaksh sumitra mahajan ne bich main aate hue kaha ki 'ye (mallikarjun khadge) aapse bade hai, isliye inhone aapako aashirwad diya he
 Yogi Adityanath said in the House, 'when i first came to Parliament after choosing from Gorakhupar, i was very thin at first
 ' is par loksabhaa adhyaksh sumitra mahajan ne kaha ki 'abhi bhi koi bahut mote nahin ho, vaise hi vajan badha he'
 When Surjit Singh Barnala (former Chief Minister of Punjab) saw me for the first time, he kept watching me for about half an hour
 unhone mujhase poocha ki kya tum gorakhpur se ho, to maine haa main uttar diya
 After this, they kept seeing me again
 unhone dobaaraa mujhase yahi poocha or maine yahi jawaab diya
 When he asked for the third time that you are from Gorakhpur, then i said yes, but why are you asking this? to unhone kaha ki main ek baar gorakhpur gaya tha to vahaan donon ore se bam chalane lage to main vahaan se turant chalaa gaya or dobaaraa vahaan nahin gaya
 Yogi Adityanath further said, 'I was shocked to know that such things are done about our city and district
 iske baad maine gorakhpur main sabhi vyapaarik, saamaajik or saanskrithik sanghathanon ke saath baithak kii, taaki is samasya kaa samaadhaan nikaala jaae
 Today i can say that in the last 15 years we have not allowed a single businessman in Gorakhpur to give goonda tax
 ek bhi vyapaaree-chikitsak kaa apharan nahin hua
 We can say that now we will create a similar safe environment in the whole of UP
 iske baad unhone congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi or upi ke purv mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav par mazaakia lahaze main tanj ksaa
 He said that people can say about my age
 main rahul gandhi se ek saal chota hum
 To this, he jokingly drew the attention of Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge, jokingly, Kharge, Rahul ji is not in the House
 main rahul gandhi se ek saal chota hum
 The comments iske baad unhone unhone nishaanaa saadhaa samaajawaadee party par or kaha ki mulaayam singh yadav ji kii party se abhi koi sadan main nahin he or main yah bhi bataanaa chahta hum ki main akhilesh se ek saal bada hum
 i come in between the pair of both
 yah aapaki vifaltaa ek ek bada kaaran ho saktaa he
 Mallikarjun Kharge also did not remain silent on this statement of Yogi Adityanath and he said in the House that 'you have come between Rahul and Akhilesh ji, but now you are the CM of (uttar Pradesh) there
 main aapako badhai detaa hum, lekin aap is stand out ko menten kiijie or usee kii garima rakhkar aage chaliye
 On this, Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan came in the middle and said that 'he (mallikarjun Kharge) is older than you, so he has blessed you
 jab surajeet singh barnaala (punjab ke purv mukhyamantri) ne mujhe pehali baar dekha to ve mujhe kareeb aadhe ghante tak dekhte rahe
 He asked me if you are from Gorakhpur, then i answered yes

" inamen se sabhi par alag-alag str par kaam ho rahaa he

 jeet waisi nahin rahi jaisi congress ne ummid laga rakhi thi, phir bhi jeet to jeet hoti he
 The tough struggle between Congress and BJP for 18 hours on 11 and 12 December has rarely been seen before in India's 60-plus-year electoral history
 aise maukey bhi aae jab bhaajapa congress se aage nikal gai thi lekin apni badhat vah barkaraar nahin rakh pai
 The Congress emerged as the single largest party by winning 114 seats in the 230-member assembly and wrested the seat of the state from the BJP for the last 15 years
 congress ko is jeet tak pahunchane vaale chhindwara ke saansad or ab mukhyamantri kamalnath, jinhone ek may se pradesh adhyaksh kii kaman sambhaal rakhi thi, kareeb 2 baje party daftar se nikle or daawa kiya ki unke paas sarkaar banane ke liye paryaapt bahumat he
 Exit polls were predicting a tough fight between Congress and BJP in Madhya Pradesh, but Congress leaders were confident that they were winning the election
 par jab mangalvaar subah matganana shuru hui to shaayad hi kisi congressi netaa ko anumaan rahaa hoga ki ginati main uthapatak kaa yah daur itnaa lanbaa chalegaa
 After the initial gains seen on TV channels, Congressmen started celebrating and fireworks started outside the state office
 lekin dopaher tak maamla kuch or najar aane laga
 It seemed that the BJP had not weakened
 isliye digvijay singh or jyotiraditya sindhiya ne, jinka pehle mangalvaar tak hi bhopal main rukne kaa kaarykram tha, apane kaarykram main pherbadal kiya or pradesh mukhyalay kii teesri manzil par hi jame rahe
 The phone bells rang
 jahaan kahin bhi antar bahut maamuli dikhataa tha yaa jahaan kahin bhi gadabadi kii maamuli-si bhi ashanka dikhti thi vahaan ke colector, paryvekshak or ummidavaar sabko phone ghumaya jaataa
 Finally, with the certificate of victory for 114 Congress winners at 2 in the afternoon, Kamal Nath received a letter of support from a total of 121 mlas with the support of four rebels, two BSP and one SP MLA, who contested as independents and Governor Anandi reached Ben Patel claiming to form the government
 12 disambar ko mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ne haar sweekaar lee thi or patel ko apana istipha saunp diya tha
 a difficult electoral campaign finally ended, with many things happening for the first time
 congress ne aakhir kis prakaar iskaa prabandhan kiya or ise apane niyantran main rakhaa? thodaa jaanane kii koshish karte hai
 Firstly, the Congress started the campaign with an attempt to repair its house
 yah sandesh dene kii koshish hui ki congress netritv ekajute he
 The first such meeting was held in June 2017 at Gohad in Bhind district
 uske baad may 2018 main kamalnath ko pradesh adhyaksh or jyotiraditya sindhiya ko chunaav abhiyaan samiti kaa pramukh banaaya gaya
 Digvijay Singh, the broad-based party among the party's people in the state, who completed the 3,300-km-long Narmada Parikrama Yatra, was asked to embark on another yatra
 is baar unki yatra tikaton ke vitaran ke baad congress ke netaaon kii aapasi naaraazgi dur karne or ekta sunishchit karne ke liye thi
 It was strategically decided to keep Digvijay out of the campaign otherwise the BJP would raise issues like power, roads and water scarcity in Madhya Pradesh before 2003
 antim daur main digvijay ne ummidavaaron ke liye chunaav abhiyaan chalaaya, jinamein se kai jeetne main kaamyaab rahe
 The message was clear: If Congress leaders cannot work together, at least they should not work against each other
 sanghathanaatmak str par kamalnath ne korporate style main kaam kiya or jaankariyon ke liye peshewar agenciyon par bharosa kiya
 Several seats were surveyed on many seats to analyze the ethnic truth of the constituencies, ethnic divisions being a regrettable truth of Indian politics that cannot be eradicated
 media reporting kii nigaraanee ke liye agenciyon ko lagaaya gaya or sakaaratmak or nakaaratmak kawarej se judi excel shits taiyaar karne ko kaha gaya
 The party also adopted many things of the bjp's electoral strategies
 soshal media par sandesh ke prasar par bahut jor diya gaya or video ke jariye bhaajapa sarkaar par hamale kiye gaye
 In fact, the footage of Chauhan's farmhouse which was played on social media two days before the vote was taken by drone cameras
 iske peeche manshaa thi ki kisaan putr kii chhavi vaale mukhyamantri vastav main kis prakaar ke aishoaaraam main rahete hai
 His small farm also had dairy plants, several houses and paved roads
 jaahir he, congress vahi sab kar rahi thi jo 2014 ke chunaav main bhaajapa ne kiya tha
 Significantly, Kamal Nath focused on the block-level leadership in the party, due to which he has managed to win the Lok Sabha elections nine times in Chhindwara
 unhone usee anubhav ko puure rajya main doharaaya
 The candidates were asked to strengthen booths like the BJP and cellphone-equipped workers were appointed as Panna Pramukhs, whose job was to bring more and more voters to the booth
 booth masping ke jariye pradesh karyaalay ne sabhi boothon par najar rakhi thi
 At the same time, booth-level workers were kept busy and their morale high by making frequent phone calls from the Congress war room
 waar room main ek legal cell bhi banaaya gaya tha jo ummidavaaron yaa jo log bhi bharat ke nirvachan ayog main koi shikaayat darj karnaa chaahate hon, unhen fouran sahaayta muhaiyaa kara rahaa tha
 All the leaders, including Rahul Gandhi, also tried to make themselves look "hindu" clearly for which they also visited many temples
 congress ke data analytics wing main kaam kar rahe ek congress netaa ne bataaya, "congress kaa maananaa he ki party adhyaksh ne mandiron kii jo yatraaen kin uskaa sandesh matadaataaon ke bich pahunchaa
 In fact, the strong reactions that the BJP gave to the philosophy of temples brought a stronger message
 congress ne vibhinn muddon kii chunaav ayog main shikaayat karke bhaajapa par dabaav banane kii apni ranneeti jari rakhi
 After the campaign was over, the Commission did not allow Chauhan to attend a funeral and, furious, Chauhan called the Commission "inhuman"
 jaahir he congress kaa dabaav kaam kar rahaa tha
 This time the Congress also took great care in distributing tickets
 sheersh netaaon ne dilli main mulaakaat kii, jahaan har seat ke liye prastaavit har ummidavaar ke jeetne kii sambhaavnaaon par gahan charchaa kii gai
 The idea was to choose the most capable candidate to win, even if he was loyal to a group
 congress ke netaa ne kaha, "lambey samay baad kisi seat se kisi pratyaashee vishesh ko maidan main utaarne kii ek khaas vajah thi
 Whether the candidate won or not, the prospects of every potential candidate were severely weighed before being given a ticket
 ''ranneetik rup se pradhanmantri modi kii reliyaan shuru hone se pehle hi rahul kii rajya kii yatra kii yojanaayen banaai thim
 Two months before the election, the Congress President had made seven visits to Madhya Pradesh
 ve vibhinn kshetron ke vibhageeya mukhyalayon tak pahunche or inamen road sho bhi shaamil the, jinamein baari bheed umadi
 On the other hand, Prime Minister Modi held 10 public meetings in five visits to the state
 kshetravaar dekhen to congress ne gwalior-chambal main is baar kaaphi acha pradarshan kiya, jise aamtaur par jyotiraditya sindhiya kaa garh mana jaataa rahaa he
 Apart from this, the party also did well in Kamal Nath's stronghold Mahakaushal
 malwa-nimad or bundelkhand main pichhali baar kii tulana main maamuli sudhaar hua
 The party suffered the biggest blow in Baghelkhand, the responsibility of which was in the hands of Ajay Singh, leader of the opposition in the assembly and son of Arjun Singh
 ajay singh khud bhi us churhat seat se chunaav haar gaye jahaan se ve chah baar vidhayak rahe hai
 He was defeated by bjp's Sharadendu Tiwari, whose family has been the political rival of the Ajay Singh family for many generations
 kya mandsaur main rahul kii krishi karj maafee kii ghoshnaa ne congress kii naiya paar kara di? yakeen ke saath kahana mushkil he
 Loans to farmers are disbursed throughout the state and not in a particular region
 haalanki, gwalior-chambal kshetra main aise maamle sabase zyada prakaash main aae hai, jahaan kisaan karj nahin chukaa paae, jise congress ne lapak liya
 malwa-nimar and Mahakaushal have the best debt repayment records and the Congress has performed much better than the last time in both the regions
 baghelkhand kshetra main karj kaaphi baanta gaya he, jahaan congress kaa pradarshan bahut bura rahaa
 What was the impact of the famous farmers' agitation in June 2017, in which six people were killed in police firing and which inspired the Congress to launch the movement? bjp's Jagdish Deora won from Malhargarh seat in Mandsaur district with a huge margin
 mandsaur or neemuch jilon main jahaan krishi andolan sabase zyada hinsak tha, bhaajapa ne saat main se chah siten jeetin, jo darshata he ki yah rajnatik rup se koi bada mudda nahin bana
 Says political analyst Achal Singh, "the biggest victory for the BJP was in the Baghelkhand region, for which the BJP itself believes that there could not be as much development there as in other areas of the state
 party ne jis kshetra main sabase zyada kaam kiya or jo sangh kii prayogshaala bhi he, us malwa or nimad main congress ne sabase zyada siten jeetin
 "the reasons for the Congress's worst defeat in Baghelkhand are being analyzed, but at first glance it seems that the Congress has lost there due to a triangular contest between BJP, Congress and BSP
" baagiyon ne donon pakshon ko gambhir nuksaan pahunchaaya, lekin congress apane un baagiyon ko manaakar waapas laane main kaamyaab rahi, jinhone nirdaleey pratyaashee ke rup main chunaav ladaa or jite
 Surendra Singh Thakur of Burhanpur, Kedar Dabur from Bhagwanpur, Pradeep Jaiswal of Varasivani and Vikram Singh of Susenar joined the Congress on 12 December
 duusari taraf, bhaajapa ko purv mantri ramakrishna kusamariya jaison se jujhna padaa, jinhone nirdaleey chunaav ladaa or damoh tathaa pathariya main itane vot paane main kaamyaab rahe jisase bhaajapa ummidavaaron jayant malaiya or lakhan patel kii haar sunishchit ho gai
 The Congress was considered to be a party representing the interests of the farmers, but it also infiltrated the seats in the urban areas
 bhopal main party ne shahar kii teen siten jeetin, jahaan bhaajapa ko apni garibonmukhi yojanaon jaise sambal yojana se bahut laabh hone kii ummid thi
 The Congress won four of the nine seats in Indore
 2013 main use keval ek seat mili thi
 In Gwalior too, the party won five of the six seats
 shaharon main mili jeet ke mukhya kaarnon main anya baton ke alaava camel nath ke kushal netritv ko mana ja rahaa he
 It should also be a warning to Prime Minister Modi, who is considered the real hero of the urban masses
 is baar shahari aabaadi bhaajapa se kinaaraa karti najar ai
 This time the elections in Madhya Pradesh showed the effect of anti-upper caste reservation movement
 ek savarna alpsankhyak pichhadaa varg kalyaan samaaj (spakes) party astitv main ai, jisane sabhi siton par chunaav ladaa tha, lekin use kahin bhi 1,500 se zyada vot nahin mili jo kul voton kaa maatr 0
 4 percent
 gwalior or chambal, jahaan savarna andolan bahut shaktishaalee tha, vahaan bhi party kuch nahin kar saki
 a Dalit movement in the gwalior-chambal region also polarized the Dalit votes in favor of the Congress, with the movement losing six lives in April 2018
 basapa ne 2013 main gwalior-chambal kshetra main do siten jiti thim, is baar keval ek seat jeet saki, jo darshata he ki dalit is baar congress ke paksh main majbootee se khadey the
 The party won 16 of the 35 seats reserved for Dalits in 2018, while in 2013 it had to be content with just four seats
 isi tarah janajatiyon ke liye arakshit 47 siton main se usne 28 jiti hai jabaki 2013 main use maatr 15 siten mili thim
 There was a big decline in the bjp's SC seats and they came down from 28 to 19
 pichley chunaav main asti ke liye arakshit 31 siten jeetne vaali bhaajapa ko is baar sirf 18 siten mili hai
 The advantage of 56 seats for the Congress shows that this time the people had voted for change
 lekin congress ke vidhayakon kii badi sankhya main haar bhi hui, jo darshata he ki satta virdohi lahar kii aanch se vipakshi vidhayak bhi achoote nahin rahete
 13 out of 33 ministers of the Chauhan cabinet also lost the election
 haalanki madhya pradesh main purab se pashchim tak jo parivartan kii lahar chal rahi thi uske saamne chouhan majbootee se khadey rahe or bhaajapa ko badi haar se bachaa liya
 As was reflected in all the surveys, Chauhan maintained his popularity but it was not enough
 rajyapal anandiben patel ko apana istipha dene ke turant baad, nivartmaan mukhyamantri chouhan ne kaha, "main haar kii naitik jimmedaari letaa hum
 If i have hurt someone's feelings, i apologize for that
 hamane janata ke liye kalyankari yojanaayen shuru kin, phir bhi hamen janadesh nahin mila
 i hope that the new government will continue the plans that we had started
 ab ham aagaamee loksabhaa chunaav ke liye kaam karenge
 "this happened even before, this is not the first time that no party has got a simple majority in Madhya Pradesh
" varsh 1962 ke avibhajya empi ke chunaav main tab kii congress sarkaar ko 142 siten mili thim jo 288 kii sadsy sankhya vaali vidhansabha main saadhaaran bahumat ke lihaaj se 3 kam thim
 Then 39 independents won the election
 nirdaleey vidhayakon kaa hi ek gut tha jisane congress ko sarkaar banane main sahyog kiya tha
 The Congress will form a government with four rebels who will contest the election as an independent candidate and then win, two BSP and one SP MLA will make the Congress strength 121

 Despite Rohit not being in form, New Zealand have managed to retain their place in India's Test squad for the series but failed to stake claim in the playing XI for the first Test
 sapaat pich par unke mumbai ke saathiyon pavaar (228 gend main 100 ran), yadav (86 gend main 103 ran), siddhesh laad (62 gend main naabad 86 ran) or armaan jafar (123 gend main 69 ran) ne acha pradarshan kiya
 Mumbai started to play by 29 runs for one wicket and by the stumps on the second day, they scored 431 losing five wickets
 newjiland ne kal shuruaati din saat wicket par 324 ran par pari ghoshit kii thi
 Today, Mumbai team scored 4 in 90 overs 
 46 kii ran gati se kul 402 ran jutaaye
 Today was a tough day for the visiting team, their bowlers worked hard in the sun and did not get much success
 tej gendbaajon se bhi sapaat pich par zyada ummid nahin kii ja rahi thi lekin newjiland kii spin tikdi sodhi (132 ran dekar do wicket), mishael santner (71 ran dekar ek wicket) or mark craig (60 ran dekar koi wicket nahin) kaa pradarshan bhi kuch khaas nahin rahaa
 Looking at the Test series, the only disappointment for India was the dismissal of Rohit, who also played in the final of the Duleep Trophy to regain form
 rohit jafar kaa wicket girane ke baad krij par utre, unhen pehla ran jutaney main 10 gend lagi lekin unhone style se shuruuaat kii or leg spinner sodhi kii gend par street hit karte hue chakke ke liye bheja
 However this was the only good shot of his brief 18-run knock and he was stumped in an attempt to hit Sodhi
 iske baad yadav krij par pavaar kaa saath dene utre
 Yadav took full advantage of getting a life donation
 unhen tej gendbaaj trent bolt or nil wagonar yaa teen spinneron kii gendbaaji se koi fark nahin padaa
 Yadav's dominance can be gauged from the fact that he completed his half-century and century by hitting sixes
 unhone apni pari main aath chakke lagaae jisamen se zyaadaatar mid wicket par lage or unki pari main nau chauke bhi shaamil the
 The comments pavaar bhi apane chor par date rahe, in donon ne chauthe wicket ke liye 155 ran kii bhagidaari nibhaai
 Pawar retired after scoring a century
 laad krij par utre jinhone bhi aditya taare (naabad 53 ran) ke saath ballebaaji kaa lutf uthaaya
 By the time the day's play was over, Kotla was raining sixes and fours due to the tired bowlers
 (hedline ke alaava, is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he, yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he
 ) rohit form main na hone ke baavjood newjiland siries ke liye bharat kii test team main apana sthaan barkaraar rakhane main safal rahe hai lekin vah pehle test ke liye antim ekadash main daawa pesh karne main asafal rahe
 On the flat pitch, his Mumbai teammates Pawar (100 off 228 balls), Yadav (103 off 86 balls), Siddhesh Lad (86 not out off 62 balls) and Armaan Jaffer (69 off 123 balls) performed well
 mumbai ne ek wicket par 29 ran se aage khelnaa shuru kiya or duusare din stump tak usne paanch wicket ganvaakar 431 ran bana liye
 New Zealand declared the innings on 324 for seven on opening day yesterday
 aaj mumbai kii team ne 90 over main 4
 a total of 402 runs were scored at a run rate of 46
 mehmaan team ke liye aaj kaa din kaaphi kathin rahaa, unke gendbaajon ne dhoop main mehnat bhi kii or unhen zyada safalataa bhi nahin mili
 The fast bowlers were also not expecting much on a flat pitch, but New Zealand spin trio Sodhi (2 for 132), Mitchell Santner (1 for 71) and Mark Craig (no 60) Nothing special happened
 test siries ko dekhte hue bharat ke liye ekmaatr niraashaa rohit kaa out hona rahi, jo form hasil karne ke liye dalip trophy ke final main bhi khele the
 Rohit Jaffer's wicket came to the crease after the fall, he took 10 balls to get the first run but he started with style and sent a six off the leg off the leg-spinner Sodhi
 haalanki yah unki 18 ran kii sankshipt pari kaa ekmaatr acha shot rahaa or vah sodhi ko hit karne ke prayaas main stump out hue
 After this Yadav went to support Pawar at the crease
 yadav ne jeevandaan milane kaa puraa phayda uthaaya
 He did not mind the pace bowling of fast bowlers Trent Boult and Neil Wagner or three spinners
 yadav ke dabadabe kaa andaja is baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki unhone apana ardhashatak or shatak chakka lagaakar puraa kiya
 He hit eight sixes in his innings, most of them at mid-wicket and his innings included nine fours
 tippaniyan Pawar too remained at his end, both of whom contributed 155 runs for the fourth wicket
 pavaar shatak banane ke baad ritair out hue
 Lad landed at the crease who also enjoyed batting with Aditya Tare (53 not out)
 din kaa khel samaapt hone tak gendbaajon ke thakne se kotla par chhakkon or chaukon kii barsaat ho rahi thi

 lakhanu main eemm ke adhyaksh asaduddin ovaisi or aresas chif mohan bhagwat donon aae lekin samaajawaadee party ke logon ne bhagwat ko nahin, balki ovaisi ko kaale jhande dikhaae
 This is a matter of discussion in political circles
 ovaisi agle vidhaan sabha chunaavon main upi main apni party ol india majalise ittehadul muslemin ko maidan main utaarna chaahate he
 UP has more than 18 per cent Muslim vote, the bulk of which was won by Samajwadi Party in the last assembly elections
 ovaisi samaajawaadee party ke usee muslim vot bank main hissaa bantaana chaahate hai
 Of course, the Samajwadi Party will not like it
 ovaisi pichley do saal main kai baar azamgarh or lakhanu main sabha karne kii koshish kar chuke hai, lekin prashasan kaanoon vyavastha kaa masalaa bataa ke unhen isaki ijazat nahin detaa
 Owaisi was able to hold a meeting in Faizabad recently when his candidate was contesting the by-election from there
 lakhanu main somvaar ko apni press conference main ovaisi ne kaha, "aaj lakhanu main aresas ke chif hai
 Their meeting is going to take place, but permission is not given to Asaduddin Owaisi, it proves that who has joined the RSS
 " Owaisi, like a firm politician, went to all the places of the Muslims
 sabase pehle vah barabanki ke deva main sufi sant haji vaaris ali shah kii mazaar par gaye, jo sufi or barelvi musalamaanon ke ibaadat kii jagah he, phir vah nadvatul ulema gaye jo wahabi islam kaa centre he, or uske baad vah moulana kalbe javwaad se milane gaye jo shiya musalamaanon ke bade dharm guru hai
 The comments ovaisi ke nishane par samaajawaadee party zyaada thi
 His second attack was on BJP, but as usual he did not speak against BSP
 balki unhone kaha ki unki party kaa naaraa "jai mim or jai bhim" he
 'mim' is the Urdu letter that emits the sound of "m"
 isliye ovaisi kaa "mim" se matlab muslim or "bhim" se matlab dalit se he
 Owaisi raised slogans of "hindustan Zindabad" and "jai Hind" 5 times in his press conference
 unhone kaha ki vah desh bhakt hai
 Indians are urban
 awwal darje ke shahari hai, lekin unhen kisi se desh bhakthi kaa certificate nahin chahie
 " upi main 18 fisad se zyaada muslim vot he jiskaa bada hissaa pichley vidhaan sabha chunaav main samaajawaadee party ko mila tha
 Owaisi wants to share in the same Muslim vote bank of the Samajwadi Party
 zaahir he samaajawaadee party ise pasand nahin karegi
 Owaisi has tried to convene several times in the last two years in Azamgarh and Lucknow, but the administration does not allow them to address the issue of law and order
 ovaisi pichley dinon faizabad main us vaqt ek sabha kar paae jab unka ummidavaar vahaan se up-chunaav lard rahaa tha
 In his press conference in Lucknow on Monday, Owaisi said, "today, there is an RSS chief in Lucknow
 unki sabha hone ja rahi he, magar asaduddin ovaisi ko parmishan nahin diya jaataa, isse baat sabit ho gai kii koun aresas se mila hua he
 " ovaisi kisi pakke siyasatdan kii tarah muslmamanon ke har firaqe se judy hui jagahon par gaye
 First he visited the tomb of Sufi saint Haji Waris Ali Shah in Dewa, Barabanki, which is the site of worship of Sufi and Barelvi Muslims, then he went to Nadwatul Ulema which is the center of Wahhabi Islam, and then he met Maulana Kalbe Jawwad Gaya, who is a major religious guru of Shia Muslims

 aapako bhale hi ye lagata ho ki hindustan ke skool collejon main raging naam kaa rakshas mar chukaa he lekin aap bilkul galat hai
 But this news will make your hair stand up
 sainik skool tilaiya, desh kaa ek behad pratishthit or janaa mana skool
 Parents of Jharkhand and adjoining states dream that their children get admission in Sainik School Tilaiya so that their future is made
 jharkhand ke koderma main sthit sainik skool apane anushaasan or behtareen padhai kii vajah se mashhoor he lekin usee skool main khuleam udayi ja rahi he anushaasan or supreme court ke ranging ke khilaaf niyamon kii dhajjiyaan
 The senior students of the school are ragging and during this time the junior students are also beaten with belts and punches
 is jhakzor dene vaali ghatana ko sainik skool ke hi ek chaatr ne apane mobile par kuch dinon pehle hi kaid kiya he
 The fact of ragging in school is that a student is afraid to leave school and is forced to wash dishes at his mother's dhaba
 shanbhu ( badla hua naam) naam kaa yah chaatr bhi tilaiya sainik skool main aathvin kaa chaatr he lekin seniors ke raging kii vajah se use skool se apane ghar ranchi aana padaa
 Traces of wounds on Shambhu's body are also presenting to you the black reality of ragging in Sainik School Tilaiya
 shanbhu kii maa ne bhi ab faisla kar liya he ki unka laal raging kii bhent ab or nahin chadhega
 Students of Sainik School Tilaiya are also confessing to ragging on camera but the school administration is saying that they are completely unaware of the ragging
 kya aisa mumkin he ki jis kadavi hakeekat kii jaankaree skool ke andar or baahar har kisi ko ho wo skool ke aalaa adhikariyon ko hi na pataa ho
 The Supreme Court may have banned ragging, but after these sordid news of Sainik School Tilaiya, it seems that the monster school college of ragging is still alive everywhere and is openly doing its own arbitrary
 sainik skool tilaiya se apane ghar ranchi laut chukaa aathvi kaa chaatr shanbhu raging ke rakshason kii karatuut kaa jeeta jaagta saboot he
 Shambhu could not muster the courage to reveal the cause of poverty in his school, but now he is clearly saying that the warden of the hostel is also present at the time when senior students fight and ragging junior students
 
 apane saath hue raging or marpet kii kahani sirf ranchi kaa shanbhu hi nahin bayaan kar rahaa he balki sainik skool ke duusare junior chaatr bhi camere par khuleam is baat kii gavaahi de rahe hai ki haa, skool main senior chaatr karte hai apni manamaani
 But the school administration is not ready to accept the truth
 skool prashasan ye daleel de rahaa he ki unke paas raging ko lekar abhi tak koi bhi jaankaree or shikaayat nahin ai he lekin jis tasviir or khabar kaa duniya ko pataa ho usase sambandhit skool hi anjaanaa ho, sunakar bada haasyaaspad lagata he
 It is surprising how the ragging demons are still openly committing their misdeeds in a well-known military school in the country
 kaise unki vajah se ek honhaar apana bhavishya takreeban gavaan chukaa he or kaise duusare chaatro kaa bhavishya daanv par laga hua he

 kamedian kapil sharma ke sho se team ke kai kalakaaron ke jaane ke baad ab navjot singh siddhu kaa naam bhi is list main jud rahaa he
 There are reports that Archana Puran Singh will now be seen in place of Navjot Singh Sidhu in the show
 bataa den ki siddhu pichley kai dinon se biimaar chal rahe hai
 According to the news, there is already discussion of a dispute between Kapil and Sidhu about the chair
 maamla ye he ki siddhu biimaar the
 He had high fever
 aise main kapil ke sho kii sande ke liye shooting ruk gai
 With this, his chair also became dry
 lekin kapil ne siddhu ke lautne kaa intjaar nahin kiya or unki jagah archana puuran singh ko baitha diya
 Kapil Sharma's show will be the makeover, this film name associated with the team, Sidhu went through it and he lashed out at Kapil
 kapil ne siddhu ko puri baat samajhane kii koshish kii, lekin ve kuch bhi sunne ko taiyaar nahin the
 Now Sidhu has been out of the show and Archana himself made this information during a conversation
 kapil sharma ke saath channel ne badhaayaa contract, band nahin hoga shorchana puuran singh ne ek intervyuu ke dauraan kaha ki sho ke audiyans siddhu ji ko is kursi par baithe dekhne ke aadi hai
 It feels very strange to sit on Sidhu's chair
 kapil sharma ne mujhe shooting ke din hi bulaayaa to main apane puraane dost ko manaa nahin kar pai
 Archana further said that i will be seen in only a few episodes on Kapil's show, as soon as Sidhu ji's health improves, he will be back in his chair again
 aapako bataa den ki kapil or archana kii dosti kaaphi puraani hai
 When Kapil was nothing and was seen doing comedy like the rest of the comedians in 'comedy Circus', the two are friends of each other
 kapil sharma phir vivaad main, ab kursi ko lekar hua siddhu se jhagadabtaa den ki navjot singh siddhu ne kai baar kapil ke sho ke liye time edjust kiya he, us samay bhi jab unka mumbai main rahane kaa intjaam nahin tha
 He has also shot the show two to three days before, so that it can be edited on time
 aise main kapil dwaara itani jaldi apana vikalp khoja janaa siddhu ko nagavar gujara
 However, it is worth knowing why Sidhu is so upset with Archana

 unhone hairat jataate hue kaha, ‘yadi abhi kii sthiti aisi he to pataa nahin garmi ke mausam main ghuspaith ke halaat kaise honge?’antni ne kaha, ‘donon deshon ke dijiemo ke bich haal hi main hui baithak ke baad niyantran rekha par tanaav main kami aayi he lekin vahaan sthiti saamaanya hone ke babat main kuch nahin kah saktaa or na hi koi aakhri samaysima tay kar saktaa hum
 It depends on many factors
 ’niyantran rekha par halaat or islamic aatankwaad se bharat ko khatre ke bare main kiye gaye sawaal ke jawaab main raksha mantri ne kaha, ‘hamen najar rakhni hogi
 After the tragic and inhumane incident, Pakistan assured us about some things
 hamen yah dekhnaa hoga ki uski ore se die gaye aashwaasan amal main kis tarah laae jate hai
 Antony said, "it is too early to make the relationship normal
" hamen intjaar karnaa hoga or najar banaae rakhana hoga ki jamini halaat kaise rahete hai
 Other factors also have to be paid attention to
 bhavishya kii karrwai or bhavishya main sambandhon ke babat ham koi bhi faisla jaldbaaji main nahin karenge

 Inflation in the country often begins to be discussed, but when the government makes good decisions, no one mentions it
 " 22 july ko gorakhpur kii raily main yah kehete hue pradhanmantri narendra modi bhartiya raajnneeti or aarthik prabandhan kii sabase puraani duvidha ko sweekaar kar rahe the, jisane kisi pradhanmantri kaa peechha nahin choda
 Despite many good starts, inflation has severely broken the political message of "achhe Din"
 pichley do saal main sarkaar mahangaai par niyantran kii nai sujh yaa ranneeti lekar saamne nahin aa saki jabaki antarrashtriya maahaul (kachche tel or jinson kii ghatati keemten) bharat ke mafik rahaa he
 The challenge of the government is that despite the good monsoon, in the next two years there is going to be a lot on the tax, market and monetary policy front, which will increase the inflation dilemma
 bharat ke fasali ilaakon main barish kii pehali bauchhaaron ke bich upabhokta mahangaai jhulasane lagi he
 In June, consumer prices crossed the seven percent mark, reaching an all-time high of 22 months
 achche monsoon kii chaaya main mahangaai kaa zikr atapata nahin laganaa chahie
 The latest history of inflation (post 2008) is a testimony that successful monsoons have not helped in controlling food inflation, however, due to bad monsoon, difficulties are definitely increasing
 pichley paanch saal main bharat main mahangaai ke sabase kharaab daur behatar monsoonon kii chaaya main aae hai
 Therefore, it is not logical to add long term expectations other than immediate relief from inflation in monsoon
 bharat kii mahangaai jatil, ziddee or bahuaiami ho chuki he
 The new sample is the latest inflation data
 aam taur par khaadya utpaadon kii mulya vruddhi ko shahari chunauti mana jaataa he lekin may ke aankadon ke anusaar gramin ilaakon main mahangaai badaae kii raftaar shaharon se zyada tej thi
 Between the crisis of farming and the decline in the wage rate in rural areas, the inflation of rural inflation is scary for politics
 achche monsoon ke baavjood teen aisi badi vajah hai jinke chalate agle do saal mahangaai ke liye chunauti purna ho sakate hai
 The first reason is the proposed increase in salaries of government employees
 india reating kaa akalan he ki vetan ayog kii siforeeshon ke baad khapat main 45,100 karod ru
 Will increase
 pratyaksh rup se yah faisla maang badhayega, lekin isse mahangaai ko takat bhi milegi jo pehle hi badhat kii ore he
 As soon as the salary increases in the states, both demand and inflation will show a sharp increase simultaneously
 raghuram rajan ke netritv main rigerv bank mahangaai par atirikt rup se sakht tha or byaaj daron ko ooncha rakhte hue bazaar main mudra ke pravaah ko niyantrit kar rahaa tha
 This view of the central bank did not go down well with the Finance Ministry in Delhi
 rajan kii vidaai ke saath hi bharat main byaaj daren tay karne kaa paimaana badal rahaa he
 Now a monetary committee will determine the relationship between inflation and interest rates
 rajan ke nazariye se asahmat sarkaar aane vaale kuch maheenon main udaar maudrik niti par jor degi
 Whether or not interest rates are reduced by the changed parameters of monetary policy, inflation is sure to get fuel
 teesri badi chunauti badhate tex kii he
 Taxes increased continuously in the last three budgets, which had a direct impact on the pocket
 rail kiraye, phone bill, internet, skool fees kii daron main badhotaree inke alaava thi
 All these together increased the cost of living in the last two years
 jiesti ko lekar sabase badi duvidha yaa ashanka yahi he ki yadi rajyon or centre ke rajasav kii phikr kii gai to jiesti dar oonchi rahengi
 Moving towards GST, the government will have to increase the rate of service tax continuously, whose prick has already increased
 mahangaai par niyantran kii nai or prabhavi ranneeti ko lekar nai sarkaar se ummiido kaa paimaana kaaphi ooncha tha
 The reason for this was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi was about to come up with a new idea in terms of controlling price rise
 maang (mudra kaa pravaah) sikod kar mahangaai par niyantran ke puraane tareekon ke badale modi ko aapurti badhaakar mahangaai rokane vaale skool kaa samarthak mana gaya tha
 It is important to remember that Modi as the Chief Minister of Gujarat chaired a committee, which was formed to suggest ways of controlling inflation
 usne 2011 main tatkaaleen sarkaar ko 20 siforishein or 64 sutreey kaaryayojna saunpi thi, jo aapurti badhaane ke siddhant par aadhaarit thi
 The committee had suggested that the Mandi Act be abolished to increase the inter-state supply of food products
 modi samiti bhartiya khaadya nigam ko teen hisson main baant kar kharid, bhandar or vitaran ko alag karne ke paksh main thi
 The third important opinion of this committee was focused on extensive liberalization of the agricultural market
 dilachasp he ki pichley dhai saal main khud modi sarkaar inamen ek bhi sifarish ko sakriy nahin kar pai
 The government had tried to abolish or liberalize the Mandi (APMC Act) law as soon as it came to power, but the BJP ruled states did not even give it a sense
 endie sarkaar ne purv khaadya mantri or bijepi netaa shanta kumaar ke netritv main ek samiti banaai thi jisane epasiai ke vibhaajan va punargathan ko khaarij kar diya or khaadya prabandhan va aapurti tantra main sudhaar jahaan kaa tahaan thahar gaya
 If the Modi government is understanding the "mann Ki Baat" then it will have to start reforms that increase supply in the market
 antarrashtriya bazaar main jinson kii keemton main giravat unki madad ko taiyaar he
 Actually, seasonal inflation is not as big a challenge as the expectation that inflation can never come down
 bharat main is antardharna ne mahangaai niyantran kii har koshish ke dhurre bikher die hai
 It is necessary to devise a strategy to break this perception, otherwise the Modi government will have to be ready for the political and electoral losses of inflation, which will increase as the government gets older

 bihar memplastic kairi bagke prayog ko bain ke lindhisuchanajari kar di gai he
 From October 25, there will be a ban on the use of all types of carry bags
 patna hai courtke aadesh par sarkaar ne ye faisla liya he
 Earlier, the ban on the directive of the Patna High Court was to be imposed from September 24, but the government took a month to prepare
 paryaavaran or van mantralay ne isaki adhisuchana jari kar di he
 According to the notification, there is a provision of five years jail and fine of Rs 1 lakh for the production or repeated use of polythene
 sirf 50 microne hi nahin balki sabhi prakaar ke kairi bag ko iske daayre main rakhaa gaya he
 However, the government has also granted 60-day deferment to recover the stock so far
 15 disambar se polithin ke prayog par dand kii prakriya shuru ho jaaegi
 Only plastic carry bags are banned in the ban, while the ban on carry bags of more than 50 microns used for storage and storage of bio vests will not apply
 saath hi sabhi prakaar ke khaadya or anya padaarth kii packaging, doodh or paudhe ugane ke prayog main aane vaale bag bhi is pratibandh se mukt rahenge
 Earlier, the state government had assured the court that after framing the necessary rules, notification will be issued for complete ban
 iske alaava sarkaar ne court main yah bhi bataaya ki 25 oktober se shaharon main polithin ke purna pratibandh ke baad 25 november ko rajya ke gramin ilaakon main bhi is par purna pratibandh lag jayega
 That is, after a month of cities, polythene will not be used in villages
 pehle 24 sitambar se bihar main polithin par purna pratibandh kaa dedlin patna hoicourt kii taraf se diya gaya tha lekin us samay rajya sarkaar ne kaha tha ki abhi iske liye puri tarah se taiyaar nahin he
 Therefore, now the state government itself has fixed the date of October 25 to make urban areas of Bihar free of polythene

 ghatana kii soochna aanan-fanan main sthaneey police ko di gai
 On the basis of information, the police reached the spot and started looking for the miscreants by taking footage of CCTV cameras installed there
 udhar police kaa daawa he ki jald hi is lut kaa khulaasa karte hue badmaashon ko giraftaar kar liya jayega
 Let us tell you that while people are busy preparing for Diwali, the shopkeepers have also kept in their shops to sell prized items
 jewelery showrooms maalik ne bataaya ki aman jewelers par chaar badmaash aae or unhone pistal ke dam par lakhon rupye kii jewelery luti, saath hi chaar lakh kii nagdi bhi le ude

 vahiin, harfildkee tarah ladakiyon kaa pradarshan yahaan bhi bhashaa ke maamle main behatar he
 According to the survey, Delhi is among the 8 worst performing states in the language
 vahiin, ganit main kamjor pradarshan karne vaale 6 rajyon main shaamil he
 Amid the government's initiative to convene a special session of Parliament to pass the Food Security Bill, the BJP said it was not against it, although it was in favor of calling the Parliament's monsoon session a little earlier
 loksabhaa main vipaksh kii netaa sushamaa swaraj ne twitor par likhaa, ‘media main aisi khabaren aa rahi hai ki sarkaar adhyadesh yaa sansad kaa vishesh satr bulaaye jane ke vikalp par vichaar kar rahi he
 It is not appropriate to bring an ordinance for such important legislation
 ham sansad kaa vishesh satr bulaaye jane ke khilaaf nahin he
 However, he said, "the better option would be to call the monsoon session ahead of time, which is due in July
 ’is bare main bijepi kaa samarthan aise samay main aayaa he jab prastaavit khaadya suraksha vidheyak par upie samanvay samiti kii baithak somvaar ko hone vaali he
 The government is planning to call an all-party meeting on this subject
 PM narendra modi rus ke shahar upha main shanghai sahyog sanghathan (SCO) kii salanaa shikhar vaarta se itar pakistani samakaksh navaj sharif se mulaakaat karne vaale hai
 People like peace are hoping that through dialogue, the relationship between the two countries will reduce and tensions on the border end
 iske baavjood,modi-sharif kii mulakatse bharat-pakistan rishte main mithaas aane kii zyada ummid bemaani he
 This is because in the past, no meeting or talk between the two Prime Ministers has aroused any hope
 
 
 1
 Narendra Modi and Nawaz Sharif last met at the SAARC (SAARC) conference in Kathmandu in November 2014, but there was no bilateral meeting between them
 2
 Recently, India's military action against militants within the border of Myanmar has further intensified relations between India and Pakistan
 'pakistan main bhi myanmar jaisi karrwai' vaali tippanee se pakistan baukhala gaya or usne bharat ke khilaaf bayaanbaji shuru kar di
 3
 in donon netaaon ke bich pehali mulaakaat piem modi ke shapath grahan samaaroh ke dauraan hui thi
 Heads of heads of all SAARC countries were called for it, but the main focus was on modi-sharif talks
 kootneeti ke lihaaj se yah modi kaa behatar kadam tha, haalanki aage rishte or ujhal hi gaye
 4
 modi ke piem banane ke baad aisi sambhaavna jaagi thi ki bharat-pakistan ke bich ucchstareey vaarta hogi or seemaa par tanaav kam hoga
 But before the Foreign Secretary level talks, the Pakistani High Commissioner in India met the separatist leaders of Kashmir and created a controversy
 bharat naaraaz ho gaya or tab se hi donon deshon ke bich aadhikarik baatcheet nahin ho pai he
 5
 ab upha menmodi or sharif ke bich mulakatko lekar tamaam tarah kii baaten ho rahi hai
 But foreign affairs experts believe that it would be wrong to raise expectations from this meeting
 donon ke bich mulaakaat SCO shikhar sammelan ke dauraan ho rahi he
 In such a situation, more hope than bilateral talks is useless
 6
 Pakistan has also got the support of China on the issue of Lakhvi
 aise main pakistan kaa rukh pehle se zyada adiyal ho saktaa he
 7
 jab bhi bharat or pakistan ke shasnadhyaksh mulaakaat karne vaale hote hai, tab pakistan seemaa par sijafire kaa ulanghan karke tanaav paidaa kar detaa he
 Experts believe that Pakistan's military and terror elements do it on purpose, so that relations between the two countries can never be normal
 guuruuvaar raat seemaa par sijafire ke ulanghan or ek bhartiya jawan ke shahid hone se yah baat sabit hoti he
 8
 pakistan kii avam bhale hi aman pasand karti ho, par kootneeti ke jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki vahaan ke siyasatdan kabhi bhi bharat se dosti nahin kar sakate
 Saying good and bad to India in terms of Pakistan's politics is more 'beneficial' for its leaders
 yahi vajah he ki rishte saamaanya nahin hote
 An Air Hostess of Air India has accused a senior officer of sexually abusing all women working in the airline

 yahaan tak ki aaropee adhikari ne uske saamne hi duusari mahila karmchaariyon kaa yon shoshan kiya
 The victim says that when she did not listen to the accused officer, she was discriminated against
 peedita shaadishuda he or uske bachche bhi hai
 However, now she is separated from her husband with children
 chitthee main likhi aapbeetee se saaf lag rahaa he ki aaropee adhikari kaaphi powerful he or uske raajnneetik rasookh bhi hai
 The complainant Airhostess has written that the Indian government is her last hope and she has full faith in Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 chitthee main usne suresh prabhu ko sambodhit karte hue likhaa he, 'ab meri sari ummiden aapse hi hai

 or mujhe yah bhi bharosa he ki betiyon ko shikshit karne ke baad aap kaarysthal par unke saath itnaa baari anyaay nahin hone denge
 Civil Aviation Minister Suresh Prabhu has taken immediate cognizance on the letter of Airhostess
 unhone twit kiya he, 'air india ke CMD se is maamle kii tatkaal padtaal ke liye kah diya he
 If necessary, a second committee will be set up

 khud ko surakshit rakhane kaa vishesh prayog-kaale til kii dheri par maa kaali kaa chitra yaa murti sthapit karen
 Light a lamp and goog incense in front of them
 maa ko apni aayu ke baraabar laung arpit karen
 Also offer a copper coin with a hole in it
 maa ke samaksh 'kreen hrin kaali hrin kreen swaha' kaa 27 maala jaap karen
 Then put a copper coin with a hole in red thread and wear it around the neck
 isse aap har prakaar ke tantra-mantra, durghatana or grah baadha se bachenge
 It is believed that worshiping mother Kali eliminates enemies, but one thing should be kept in mind that to calm the enemy, worship mother Kali only
 agar aap virdohi yaa kisi shatru se pareshaan hai to us samasya se bachane ke liye ye upaay kariye-laal vastra dhaaran karke laal asana par baithen
 Light a lamp and googling incense in front of Maa Kali
 maa ko prasad main pede or laung arpit karen
 After this, chant 11 garlands of 'un Kreen Kalikayai Namah'
 shatru or mukademe se mukti kii prarthana karen
 Do not touch water for 15 minutes after chanting the mantra
 ye prayog lagaataar 27 raaton tak karen
 Through these experiments you can become a character of the grace of Maa Kali
 maa kaali kaa aashirwad paane ke baad aapako kisi prakaar kaa koi bhay nahin satayega

 abhinayta sanjay dutt ne pune main yaravada jail se nikalate hi sabase pehle rashtradhvaj ko salaam kiya
 Sanjay's style was surprising as hardly a criminal would have got out of jail after the completion of the sentence and saluted the tricolor
 khud sanjay dutt iske pehle saal 2007 main supreme court se jamaanat milane ke baad jab yaravada jail se baahar nikle the tab unhone tirange ko salaam nahin kiya tha
 He had gone straight out with his friend Yusuf Nalwalla, carrying his belongings in a plastic bag
 sawaal uth rahaa he ki munna bhai ne ye sahaj hi kiya yaa phir sabakuch pehle hi tay tha? kaha to ye bhi ja rahaa he ki ye salaami sanjay ke byopic kaa ek ahm hissaa ban sakati he
 Because Rajkumar Hirani himself was also present outside the jail to welcome Munna Bhai
 nirmaataa nirdek rajkumaar hiraani sanjay dutt kii nijee jindagi ko sailulide par utaar rahe hai
 Second Sanjay Dutt may be acquitted by TADA judge Pramod Kode from TADA charge
 lekin jaanch or muqadame ke dauraan jis tarah se sanjay dutt kaa naam 1993 bam dhamaakon se judaa tha wo sanjay dutt ke maathe par ek kalank kii tarah tha
 Even after being acquitted, that stain followed him
 jabaki adaalat ne sanju baba ko sirf hathiyaar rakhane ke aarope main sajaa sunai thi
 Whenever Sanjay Dutt came out of jail on parole and furlough, he would be mentioned in the media only by linking him to the 1993 bomb blasts
 aam aadmi ke liye to kanoon kii is baariki ko samajhnaa or bhi mushkil he
 This is the reason that before and after the release of Sanjay Dutt on 25 February, some people were seen protesting his release with a banner written by the traitor
 saaf he ye baat sanjay ke man ko saalon se kachot rahi thi
 Which Sanjay himself mentioned while talking to reporters at his home
 munna bhai kaa media se ye nivedan ki krupa kar ke unka naam 1993 bam dhamaakon se naa joden, apane aap main kaaphi kuch bayaan kar jaataa he
 The comments jaahir he sanjay dutt ko khud ko deshbhakt sabit karne ke liye ek pratik kii jarurat thi jisase puure desh main ye sandesh jaye ki wo deshbhakti main kisi se kam nahin hai
 For this, they could not get a fair chance from it
 shaayad isliye is maukey ko bhunaane ke liye piaar agency kii madad lee gai or munna bhai kii ek nai chhavi banane kaa puraa khaakaa taiyaar kiya gaya
 Which included Sanjay Dutt's release from prison and coming to Mumbai from the charter plane
 mumbai aakar sabase pehle siddhivinayak mandir or phir maa naragis kii kabr par jane kaa zikr tha
 So, as soon as he gets out of jail, the matter of touching the earth and saluting the national flag was deliberately kept secret so that it looks comfortable but everyone is shocked and news is made? At present, this style of Munna Bhai left an impact on everyone's mind in the country embroiled on the issue of patriotism and treason

 duusare sanjay dutt ko bhale hi tada jaj pramod kode ne tada ke aarope se bari kar diya tha
 But the way Sanjay Dutt's name was linked to the 1993 bomb blasts during the investigation and the trial was like a stigma on Sanjay Dutt's forehead
 bari hone ke baad bhi wo daag unka peechha karata rahaa
 While the court sentenced Sanju Baba on charges of possessing weapons only
 jab bhi kabhi sanjay dutt parole or farlo par jail se chhot kar aate to media main unka ullekh 1993 bam dhamaakon se jodakar hi hota
 It is even more difficult for the common man to understand this closeness of law
 yahi vajah he ki 25 farvari ko sanjay dutt kii rihaai ke pehle or baad main kuch log deshadrohi likhe binar lekar unki rihaai kaa virodh karte bhi dikhe
 It is clear that Sanjay's mind was troubled for years
 jiskaa ullekh apane ghar par patrakaron se baat karte huye sanjay ne khud kiya
 Munna Bhai's request to the media that please do not add his name to the 1993 bomb blasts, in itself, tells a lot
 tippaniyan Apparently, Sanjay Dutt needed a symbol to prove himself to be a patriot so that the message should be sent to the whole country that he is not less than anyone in patriotism
 iske liye unhen isse uchit mauka mil nahin saktaa tha
 Perhaps that's why the PR agency's help was taken to capitalize on this opportunity and a complete blueprint was created to create a new image of Munna Bhai
 jisamen sanjay dutt kii jail se rihaai ke saath charter plane se mumbai aane
 There was a mention of coming to Mumbai first to visit the Siddhivinayak temple and then to the tomb of Maa Nargis
 to kya jail se baahar nikalate hi dharti ko chune or rashtradhvaj ko salaami kii baat jaanboojh kar gupt rakhi gai taaki wo sahaj lage lekin sabko hairaan kar jaye or khabar bane? vartmaan main deshbhakt or deshadroh ke mudde par uljhe desh main munna bhai kaa ye andaaj sabake man par prabhaav chhod gaya

 During Jawaharlal Nehru's visit to Singapore in 1946, a strange situation had arisen when Edwina Mountbatten fell to the ground in the thunderous crowds to receive a glimpse of him outside the community center to welcome him
 She was waiting for Nehru
 congress kaa pramukh sadsy hone ke naate, nehru ko bhartiya sainikon se mulaakaat karne or malaya main vishaal bhartiya samudaay kii sthitiyon kaa adhyayan karne ke liye march ke madhya main singapore aamantrit kiya gaya tha
 British officials were unwilling to introduce Nehru to Indian troops due to fears of trouble, but Louis Mountbatten, associated with the South East Asia Command (SEAAC), insisted on accepting Nehru's request
 in saare vaakyon kaa zikr andryu loni kii nayi pustak ‘‘da mountbetns : der livs and loves” main he
 The book, published by Harper Collins India, stated, "mountbatten realized that he could be the first Prime Minister of India and if he was not treated well, British action would further provoke anti-british sentiments
 ”mountbeton ne aagrah kiya tha ki vah hawaii adde par nehru se mulaakaat karenge or unhen apni limosin main saint jon ambulance bhartiya kalyaan centre lekar aaenge jahaan edwina unki pratiksha kar rahi hongi
 Loney wrote, "all was well before Nehru's arrival at the center

 According to the NGO Continuous's report 'early and Child Marriage in India: a Landscape Analysis', there may be several reasons behind girls getting married at an early age, such as family income, location (urban or rural), community

 Years ago, when a young child started playing badminton in Bangalore, there was neither a stadium nor a badminton court where training could be taken
 meraa badminton court to ghar ke kareeb kenra union bank kaa ek shaadi haul tha
 i learned to play right there
 har roj ham intjaar karte ki haul main koi function to nahin he, agar nahin hota to ham skool se bhagkar vahaan pahunch jate taaki apane dil kii chaah puri kar saken
 Despite this, the most important thing of my childhood and raw age was that i never complained of any deficiency in life
 main isi baat se khush rahaa he ki hamen hafte main kuch din khilne kii suvidha to milti he
 i have never shied from both my career and my life and this is what i want to teach you children that nothing can take the place of passion, hard work, stubbornness and passion

 Because we felt that giving you a chance to fulfill the dream with which you grew up is very wrong
 tum kaamyaab ho jaati to hamen garv hota or agar nahin hoti to tumhen kabhi afsos nahin hota kyonki tumne koshish kii thi
 Remember that i have always told you how to make your way in the world
 bina apane mata-pita se ummid kiye ki ve ungali pakadakar tumhen vahaan pahunchaayenge
 i believe that children should work hard for their dreams and not wait for the success to be brought to them

 Kiran Bedi has now joined BJP
 aaie jaanate hai unke bhaajapai hone ke myne or kya ho sakati he unki yojana
 On Thursday, he said 9 things in his 9-minute speech, 10 interesting things about Bediran Bedi
 
 
 1
 Bedi's body language was worth watching from the time when Amit Shah was speaking
 unase baar-baar poocha ja rahaa tha ki kya bedi mukhyamantri pad kii ummidavaar hongi
 Shah was avoiding the matter
 (bedi ko dekhakar andaaj lagaaya ja saktaa tha ki is jawaab ke saarvajanik hone kii sabase zyada besabri unhen hi he)
 2
 jab bedi ke bolne kii baari ai to unhone sabase pehle pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa do minute tak shukriya adaa kiya
 She was saying that she is joining politics only because of her inspiration
 (haalanki, ve modi kii itani badi samarthak kabhi nahin raheen
 Be it Gujarat riots or Lokayukta there, she has been questioning Modi on Twitter) 3
 bedi boleen ki ve to apana jivan samajaseva main nyochaavar karnaa chaahati thim, lekin modi ke kehane par ab bhaajapa jwine kar rahi hai
 (bedi could also join the Aam Aadmi Party, but it was difficult to get a higher position than Kejriwal there) 4
 bedi teji main thim, maano jaldi se jaldi ve apana biodata pard dena chaahati thim
 From a teacher to a police department, he mentioned every posting he made
 ve apane do enjio ke bare main bataane se bhi nahin chuunkin
 (like any common leader) 5
 lekin dilachasp tha unka apni ritairement kii kahani kehane kaa andaaj
 She said that the police department promoted the junior officer and made him Delhi Police Commissioner
 ye unhen manjuur nahin tha
 Then he said that the post never meant anything to him
 (post kii parvaah bhi nahin or post ke liye naukari bhi chodi?)6
 One thing she emphasized more in the retirement story was to ignore her
 ve boleen ki jab unhen laga ki police vibhaag main unhen nazarandaaj kiya ja rahaa he to unhone pad chhod diya
 (she was probably hinting to the BJP that it is too heavy to ignore them) 7
 bedi boleen ki pehle ve desh or duniya main gum-ghumkar kaam karti thim
 Now, we will work hard to make Delhi the best capital of the world
 (haalanki, pehle jab unase dilli se chunaav ladane ke bare main poocha jaataa tha to ve kahati thim ki ve puure desh ke liye bani hai)8
 Finally, Bedi said that i have 40 years of administrative experience
 kis tarah kaam kiya jaataa he or kaam karaayaa jaataa he, sab jaanati hum main
 (now this can be said only by the Chief Minister who is going to take office) 9
 ve dilli main logon ko jodakar shashan chalaane kii baat karti hai
 And telling herself in mission mode
 (to isamen harj hi kya he, bhaajapa ko abhi aise logon kii jarurat he) Jammu and Kashmir is in the news right now
 dhara 370 samet kai masalon par jammu kashmir kii purv mukhyamantri or pidipi pramukh mahabuuba mufti kaaphi talkh najar aa rahi hai
 In a special conversation with Aaj Tak, Mehbooba said that the removal of Article 370 means cutting off Kashmir from India
 srinagar main india today ke kansalting editor rajdeep saradesai se khaas baatcheet karte hue mahabuuba mufti ne kaha ki jammu-kashmir muslim bahulya rajya he
 Kashmir was merged with India in very special circumstances, it had many conditions
 ye baaki rajyon kii tarah nahin he
 Under the Indian Constitution, we were guaranteed Article 370, special status and separate flags
 hamaare rishton kii buniyaad yahi he
 If you abolish these conditions then Kashmir's relationship with India will end
 'shart ke aadhaar par bharat kaa hissaa bana kashmir'jammu kashmir kii purv siem mahabuuba mufti ne kaha ki shart ke aadhaar par hi kashmir bharat kaa hissaa bana
 60 to 70 percent of Muslims in Jammu and Kashmir
 muslim bahulya hone ke baad bhi ham pakistan ke saath kyon nahin gaye
 We chose India on these terms
 dhara 370 or 35e ek pul kii tarah he
 If you end it then the relationship between India and Kashmir will also end
 vahiin bijepi ke saath gathbandhan hone ke sawaal par mahabuuba mufti ne kaha ki jab hamane bijepi ke saath haath milaayaa tha tab kaha gaya tha ki dhara 370 ke saath koi chhedchhad nahin hogi
 BJP had also agreed to this
 inhen sab baton ke saath ham bijepi ke saath gaye the
 On the question asked about the statement of Kashmir being its PM, Mehbooba Mufti said that when the election comes, the National Conference remembers being a separate Prime Minister
 vah bahumat ke saath sarkaar bana chuki he
 During that time he did not talk about being a separate PM
 shaikh abdulla ne is tarah kii baat kabhi nahin kii
 As far as PDP is concerned, we believe that Kashmir has become a part of India on certain conditions and if these conditions are broken then our relationship will also be broken

 Cabinet meeting on Kalam's death today, schedule will be decided vrath rakhane ko aamtaur par shraddha or bhakthi se hi jodakar dekha jaataa he
 At the same time there are some people who keep fast thinking that their weight will be reduced on this excuse, but only a few people will know that fasting is very beneficial for health
 vrath karne se sharir ke bheetar maujuud vishakt padaarth saaf ho jate hai
 With this, digestive activity also becomes better than before
 ye hai wo 9 vajahen jinke aadhaar par ham kah sakate hai ki vrath karne vaale lambii umr jite hai
 1
 vrath rakhane ke dauraan fat burning process tej ho jaataa he
 Due to which the fat begins to melt rapidly
 2
 Fat cells release a hormone called leptin
 vrath ke dauraan kam calories milane se laptin kii sakriyata par asar padataa he or vajan kam hota he
 3
 vrath ke dauraan kuch aavashyak poshak tatwon ko lenaa jaruri he varanaa vrath karnaa aapke liye takalifdeh ho saktaa he
 Whenever you eat something after the fast, try that it is nutritious and not full of fat
 varanaa vajan ghatane ke bajaay bad jayega
 4
 vrath karne se nai rog pratirohak koshikaon ke banane main madad hoti he
 According to experts of the University of South California, it is very beneficial for cancer patients to keep fast
 khaastaur par un marijon ke liye jo chemotherapy le rahe hai
 5
 jaruri nahin he ki jab koi dharmik mauka ho to hi aap vrath karen
 You can fast at any time to cleanse the internal filth and improve digestion
 6
 In many studies, it has been found that fasting for some time increases the metabolic rate by 3 to 14 percent
 agar vaaki aisa hi he to issepachan kriya or calories bernhone main kam vakt lagegaa
 7
 vrath karne se dimag bhi swasth rahata he
 Fasting is beneficial in many problems related to depression and brain
 8
 During the fast, you also get an idea of how wrong your food is
 9
 In today's time, stress is a very big medical problem
 vrath karne se tanaav main kami aati he
 Fitness has also become a major problem for Team India, which is suffering from poor form on the Australian tour
 captain mahendra singh dhoni samet puri team manjament khilaadiyon ke chotil hone se pareshaan he
 The ICC Cricket World Cup 2015 is on the head and so far it has been difficult to design a playing 11 due to injured players
 dhoni ne tri-siries main saare match haarane ke baad kaha tha, 'jeetna or jeet ke saath worldcup main janaa mahatvapurn hota he, lekin 15 khilaadiyon kaa feet hona usase pehle zaruri he
 
 
 Not all players were fit in this tri-series
 
 
 ' Rohit Sharma was the only batsman from India in the tri-series to score a century, but after playing 138 runs against Australia, Rohit's thigh was stretched, and he has not yet emerged from this injury
 ishanth sharma ko tisare test ke dauraan ghutane main chot lagi thi, or chauthe test main vah nahin khele
 He was given a chance in just one ODI, which was canceled due to rain
 hairaani kii baat yah rahi ki agle hi van-de main vah phir aaraam kar rahe the, jabaki dhoni ne match se pehle kii press conference main kaha tha ki rohit ko chhodkar sabhi feet hai
 According to Dhoni, 'ishant bowled in the nets and his knee was swollen, everything was fine by the time i came to the press conference, i came to know about this problem later
 
 
 ' Bhuvneshwar Kumar did not play the first three Tests due to an ankle injury
 chauthe test main vah maidan par the, lekin saaf pataa lag rahaa tha ki vah abhi puri tarah feet nahin hue hai
 His pace was also slow in the two one-day matches and the performance was also poor
 rabindra jadeja ke kandhe main lagi chot ne bhi khub surkhiyaan batorin, chot se ubharne ke baad unhen ek van-de match main gendbaaji or ballebaaji karne kaa mauka mila, lekin vah gend or balle donon se naakaam rahe or jaankaron ne unke feet hone par sawaal uthaae
 According to the information from the sources, on February 7, all these players will have a fitness test
 haalanki board se hameshaa kii tarah fitness apadet hi nahin milegaa, lekin 8 farvari ko australia ke khilaaf abhyaas match tasviir kaaphi saaf kar degaa
 Team India is gearing up for the three ODI series against England
 khilaadi nets or gym main jamkar pasinaa baha rahe hai
 The first ODI against England will be played in Pune from 15 January
 isse pehle 'viraat' team ko 10 or 12 janvari ko do abhyaas match khilne hai
 Captain Kohli has five such trump aces

 Who can play an important role in the victory of the Indian team

 Kohli will not just be a batsman but a captain
 kohli shandaar form main hai
 He played several record-breaking innings in the Test series against England
 aise main vanade siries main bhi unase aise shandaar pradarshan kii ummid rahegi
 Kohli scored 90 in 176 odis
 43 ke strike rate ke saath 8371 ran banaae hai
 Which includes his 26 centuries and 38 half-centuries
 aise main kohli se phir se damdaar pariyon kii ummid rahegi
 Kohli will try to beat England in odis in the same way that he defeated England in the Test series
 dhoni pehali baar ballebaaj ke taur par khelengemhendra singh dhoni is baar sirf ek wicketiper ballebaaj ke taur par maidan par utrenge
 In such a situation, there will be no pressure of captaincy on them
 duniya ke behtareen finishron main se ek dhoni se badi pari kii darkaar hogi
 Dhoni's recent form has been extremely poor
 captain kohli pehle bol chuke hai ki dhoni ko tisare yaa chauthe number parballebajike liye bheja ja saktaa he
 In such a situation, the fans will be expected to show a strong batting power
 dhoni ne 283 vanade match khele hai
 In which he 88
 80 ke strike rate ke saath 9110 ran banaae hai
 Dhoni has scored nine centuries and 61 fifties in his ODI career
 yuvaraj ke paas he aakhri maukaaengland ke khilaaf vanade siries main yuvaraj singh ke chayan ne har kisi ko bhale hi hairaan kiya ho
 But in this series, Yuvraj can prove to be a trump card
 yuvaraj ko maaloom he ki unke paas yeakhri maukaahoga apane chayan ko sahi sabit karne kaa
 There is no doubt that Yuvi is one of the best batsmen of odis
 lekin yuvaraj ne saal 2013 main south africa ke khilaaf aakhri vanade muqabla khelaa tha
 In such a situation, there will be a lot of pressure on them
 sixsar king yuvaraj ne bharat ke liye 293 vanade match khele hai

 ) america ke texas ke shahar huston main yojit 'houdi modi' (howdy Modi) kaarykram main hajaaron kii bheed ne hissaa liya
 After listening to the speech of PM Modi, it seemed as if he had come to address an election rally
 vahiin america ke raashtrapati donald trump ko bhi dekhakar aisa lag rahaa tha ki vah agle saal hone ja rahe chunaav ke mood main he or vahaan aae hajaaron kii sankhya main bhartiya-america ko lubhaane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 Let me tell you that there are so many people of Indian community in America now that their votes can affect the results of elections
 lekin is kaarykram ke dauraan piem modi kaa ek bayaan america ke raashtrapati donald trump ke liye mushkil ban saktaa he or virdohi bharat ke pradhanmantri ke bayaan ko mudda ban sakate hai
 During the Lok Sabha elections (2014) held in India before the last US election (2016), the slogan of 'this time Modi government' was very popular and Narendra Modi also became the Prime Minister of the country
 isi tarj par bhartiya-americanyon ko lubhaane ke liye donald trump ne bhi raashtrapati chunaav ke dauraan ek video jari kiya or kaha, 'abaki baar trump sarkaar' or is chunavi naare ne bhartiya samudaay ko khub lubhaaya
 On this matter, on Sunday, when PM Modi was addressing the Indian community in Houston, he again reminded this slogan, 'abki Baar Trump Sarkar'
 piem modi ne stadium main maujuud bhartiya mul ke logon ko yaad dilaayaa ki trump ne kaha tha, ‘abaki baar trump sarkaar '
 He said that celebrating Diwali at the White House during Trump's reign was also unique
 chunaav se thik pehle kisi bahari desh ke netaa kaa aisa bayaan jo chunaav main istemaal kiya ja chukaa he, america main chunaav main dakhal dene kaa mudda ban saktaa he
 Congress leader Anand Sharma has also objected to his statement that such statements interfere in the sovereignty and democracy of both countries
 unhone kaha ki aap (piem modi) hamaare pradhanmantri ke taur par hai or na ki trump ke star prachaarak ke taur par
 Our relationship with the United States of America has been been bipartisan, vis-à-vis Republicans and Democrats
 Your actively campaigning for Trump is a breach of both India and America as sovereign nations and democracies
 Significantly, the election of the President of America in the year 2016 has not been untouched by controversies
 is chunaav main rus ke dakhal par sidhe-sidhe aarope lag chukaa he
 However, the White House administration has done this several times and President Donald Trump also called it nonsense
 trump ne kaha, "vah (hillari clinton) apane puraane taur tareekon kii vajah se haar gayi
 She was a terrifying candidate
 maamla yaheen khatm hota he
 "trump tweeted Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and said," Deputy A
 ji
 Rod Rosenstein said at the press conference, "there has been no accusation in the accusation that a US citizen was deliberately involved in this illegal activity
 koi aarope nahin he ki isse chunaav nateezon par asar prabhaav padaa
 At the same time, Russian President Vladimir Putin also said in an interview that if a Russian citizen interfered in the US presidential election, he has nothing to do with it
 unhone is baat par jor diya ki is tarah ke prayaason ko kremlin se jodakar nahin dekha ja saktaa
 Russia, Russia, Russia! That's all you heard at the beginning of this Witch Hunt Hoax
 
 
 And now Russia has disappeared because i had nothing to do with Russia helping me to get elected
 It was a crime that did not exist
 So now the Dems and their partner, the Fake News Media,

 The three have been arrested in a robbery case

 vaise, praarambhik jaanch main police ne ladakon ke aaropon ko galat bataaya he
 Let us tell you that the Daund police arrested the three boys on the charge of robbing a truck driver 10 days ago
 police ko shaq tha ki ye ladke anya vaardaat main bhi shaamil rahe hai
 So he was sent to Baramati Taluka Police Station for questioning
 aaropee ladakon ke vakil patskaar ne kaha ki unke clients ne galat aarope nahin lagaaya he
 Narco test should be done for the policemen who have sexually harassed them
 maamle ko human ritis kamishan ke saamne bhi le jane kii taiyaari kii ja rahi he
 The boys will be presented before the court again on Monday
 madhya pradesh ke vidhansabha chunaavon main congress, bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ko chaukaa lagane se rokane kii koshish main juty hui he
 That is why the party has given the command of the campaign on the electoral pitch in the hands of a person who is aware of the stakes of cricket and is trying to prevent the saffron party from coming to rule for the fourth time with the experience of inherited royalty
 yah shaks hai jyotiraditya sindhiya, jinhen congress party ne rajya main campan cameti kaa chairman niyukt kiya he
 Jyotiraditya, a member of the Madhya Pradesh Cricket Association, which closely monitors the election campaign in the state and resigned as the Secretary of the Board of Control for Cricket in India, believes that the party lost the previous election due to factionalism, hence maintaining solidarity in the state Congress It is a big challenge for them to do it
 haal hi main madhya pradesh ke tikat final karne ke liye dilli main ho rahi baithak main rajya ke purv mukhyamantri digvijay singh or jyotiraditya sindhiya rahul gandhi ke saamne hi aapas main hi bhid gaye the
 Digvijay has decided not to contest these elections, but he was recommending some candidates
 in donon ke alaava rajya main ek dhada kamalnath kaa bhi mana jaataa he
 In such a situation, the challenge on this front is very difficult in front of Scindia
 astitv kaa sawaal or varchasv kii dharadesh main 1971 main aadhikarik taur par raaj-rajavaadon kaa astitv khatm ho gaya, lekin kuch raaj pariwaron ne duusare kaary kshetron main pair jamaane shuru kiye taaki ve varchasv kii dhara main bane rahen
 The Scindia family ranks first in this list, which became part of parliamentary politics
 guna se saansad or gwalior rajgaraane se taalluk rakhane vaalejyotiradityaka janm 1 janvari 1971 ko hua tha
 His father, late Madhavrao Scindia, has been a senior Congress leader whose legacy is being carried forward by Jyotiraditya
 jyotiraditya kii ek buaa vasundhara raaje sindhiya abhi rajasthan kii mukhyamantri hai
 The second aunt Yashodhara Raje Scindia is a cabinet minister in the Madhya Pradesh government
 jyotiraditya sindhiya ko 2001 main pitru shok kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Jyotiraditya's father Madhavrao Scindia, who was the main contender for the post of Chief Minister in Madhya Pradesh, lost his life in a plane crash on 30 September 2001
 is dardanaak haadase ke baad jyotiraditya ne viraasat main mili raste par hi chalane kaa faisla kiya
 Jyotiraditya, who returned to Stanford from Harvard, was challenged to fulfill his father's unfulfilled dreams
 mahal kii viraasat ke saath junior sindhiya ko apane pita kii rajnatik viraasat bhi sanbhaalani padi
 Jyotiraditya Scindia, who was elected for the fourth time as a Lok Sabha member from the fold, has to establish solidarity in the Congress and also to consolidate with other like-minded parties in a pluralistic political scenario like Madhya Pradesh
 haalanki rajya vidhansabha chunaav main congress ko bahujan samaaj party (basapa) kaa saath nahin mila, lekin isse jyatiraditya niraash nahin hai
 Politics is called a game of immense possibilities and they believe that BSP supremo Mayawati's decision to contest elections on her own in Madhya Pradesh should be respected
 unhen ummid he ki vidhansabha chunaavon main bhale hi basapa kaa saath nahin mila, lekin 2019 ke aam chunaavon main mayawati jarur congress ke saath hongi
 Perhaps this foresight of Jyotiraditya, who was a two-time Union Minister in the previous UPA government at the Center, motivates him to walk the long path
 jeet ke liye team bhaavana jarurinetritv karne vaale kii sabase badi khaasiyat hoti he ki safalataa kaa shrey apni team ko de or haar kii jimmedaari swayan vahan kare
 However, only the results of the Madhya Pradesh assembly elections will be able to tell how faithfully this formula of running the team was implemented, but Jyotiraditya Scindia considers the whole electoral campaign as a 'joint unit' attempt
 This is indicative of how confident they are in working with team spirit
 bijepi jiti nahin, congress hariek tivi channel ke saath baatcheech main jyotiraditya sindhiya kehete hai, ‘mujhe lagata he ki pehle hamane sambhawatah ek sanyukt ikai ke rup main kaam nahin kiya he
 We probably couldn't put our best efforts together
 mujhe lagata he ki gutbaji ne ek badi bhoomika nibhaai
 i am not blaming any x or y but we are all guilty
 ham main wo kshamta he ki ham matadaataaon par asar daal sakate hai or hamen apane agenda par vishwahas he
 i think this is not bjp's victory in the last 3 elections, i think it is a defeat of Congress
 vah maanati hai ki aapako samay kaa sahi tarah se istemaal karnaa aana chahie
 Only by doing this you can read every kind of thing in the given time

 Politics is only a little to win? My strategy is very clear, defeat BJP from here, defeat from UP in 2019

 It is very clear that our candidates are fighting well here

 Ramjas is a college of Delhi University
 1917 main raaj kedaar nath ne ramajas college kii sthapana kii thi
 This year marks the completion of hundred years of this college
 us vakt hamaare purvajon ne azaad bharat kaa naaraa lagaana shuru kar diya tha
 Today's slogan of 'we want freedom' was not there, but every slogan at that time meant that 'we want freedom'
 ab to hamen chahie azaadi ke naare ke paksh or vipaksh main kai tarah ke naare ho gaye hai
 What could not be spoken there, can it be spoken here
 ramajas college aisa vaisaa college nahin he
 Amidst the elite atmosphere, Khanty is a very historic college of mood
 college kii prastaavna kii bhaavana ke tahat 21 farvari or 22 farvari ko seminar kaa aayojan kiya gaya
 What was the feeling that the students would explore
 seminar jaisaa sochaa gaya tha us tareeke se to nahin hua, magar ramajas college main virodh kii wo samskruti dekhne ko mili, jo seminar ke vishay suchi main nahin thi
 The question came out of the syllabus
 conference room ke bheetar jo ladke ladkiyaan kis tarah pahunche or ghir gaye, isaki lambii or bhayaavah kahani he
 i am not reporting all aspects of the incident anyway, but i am putting some important aspects here
 ho saktaa he is maamle main kuch chook ho jaae
 However, it is not so easy that students are exposed to the media openly, yet many are coming forward
 unhen pataa he ki baad main jab ve akele police thane bulaaye jaayenge to unke saath kya-kya hoga
 a student of Ramjas said that the police had taken him out of his own college as a thief and those who suspected that he was involved in the killing were laughing
 unka mazaaq uda rahe the
 If the police have accepted their mistake then it should be assumed that something good has happened after it has gone very bad
 lekin wo shikayatakartaaon se hi jaanch main madad kii guhaar laga rahi he
 Crowd investigations never lead to conclusions
 abivipi or vampanthi sanghathanon ne police ko arji di he, donon ne apane apane virodh pradarshan kiye hai
 So much has happened in Delhi, a professor has been suspended from Jai Narayan Vyas University in Jodhpur because he called Nivedita Menon to speak, nothing happened
 nivedita menon aisa kya bol detii he ki jisase bhartiya ganatantr kii buniyaad hill jaati
 How long have we become so weak
 bheed or hallaa ho jane ke baad aapako pataa nahin chalata ki kisne kya kiya
 Everyone wanders off from the original question and then the matter reaches JNU, goes to Kashmir, returns to patriotism
 in baton ke zariye maarane waalon ko bachaa liya jaataa he yaa phir aarope lagane waalon ko ulajhaa diya jaataa he
 Only slogans are heard
 maarane waalon ko in naaron ke sahare bachaa liya jaataa he
 If JNU is mentioned, then hands tell
 pichley saal farvari kii ghatana thi
 There was so much ruckus
 sara kaam chhodkar media or raajnneetik dal aapas main bhid gaye
 The issue was being decided now and at the moment, where are they now? vyapam ghotaale main embibies kii padhai kar rahe 634 chaatro kaa admician cancel kar diya
 His life was ruined in a way
 in chaatro ne bhi system kaa phayda uthaaya or system se jude logon ne in chaatro ke zariye karodon kamaaye
 Have you seen any group of student organizations shouting slogans like Bharat Mata ki Jai or Lal Salaam Salam against the system that hunts 634 medical students
 rojgaar ke sawaal par kisi ko aag ugalate dekha he
 The comments umr khalid bel par he
 Charge sheet has not been made nor trial for one year
 to kya aap use sazaayaftaa maan sakate hai
 Omar Khalid is doing his phd on the protest of the tribals in Bastar
 isi par bolne gaye
 What would they say if given a chance
 ramajas college main doosraa bhaashan maaya raav kaa tha
 The theme of Maya Rao was Bodies in Protest
 aam darshakon ke liye ye baari bharkam topic lagegaa magar ise aap samajhiye ki bahut logon ke saath unke sharir kii banaavat ke kaaran hi bhedbhaav hota he
 When a gay society fights for its rights, it is the body at the center of that fight with which we form various absurd beliefs
 maaya krishna raav theatre kalakaar hai
 He explained in Ramjas what is the difference between general protests and demonstrations through theater or drama
 'accupai wal street' naam se america main zordaar pradarshan hua tha
 One topic was the Acupai Campus
 ek mahila jab campes main aati he to use barabari kaa mauka nahin miltaa he
 Srishti Srivastava, who speaks on this subject, believes that the campus should be democratized for girls
 shrrishti 'pinjadaa tod' abhiyaan chalaati hai
 Just as boys can return to hostels late at night, girls cannot go out in the evening
 pinjadaa tod is tarah ke vishay ko uthaata he
 There is a long and frightening story of how the boys reach and surround the girls inside the conference room
 main vaise bhi ghatana ke sabhi pahalu kii reporting nahin kar rahaa balki kuch mahatvapurn pahaluon ko yahaan rakh rahaa hum
 There may be some lapses in this case
 baharhaal itnaa aasaan nahin he ki chaatro ko khulkar media ke saamne aana, phir bhi kai saamne aa rahe hai
 They know what will happen to them later when they are called alone to the police station
 ramajas ke ek chaatr ne kaha bhi ki apane hi college se police, chor kii tarah nikaal kar le gai or jin par shaq tha ki wo maarane waalon main shaamil the, wo hans rahe the
 They were making fun of him
 police ne apni galati maani he to maan kar chalanaa chahie ki bahut bura hone ke baad ye kuch acha hua he
 But she is pleading with the complainants for help in the investigation
 bheed kii jaanch kabhi nattejey par nahin pahunchati he
 The ABVP and leftist organizations have applied for the police, both of which have held their own protests
 dilli he to itnaa kuch ho gaya, jodhpur ke jai narayan vyas uniwarsity ko ek professor ko isliye nilambit kar diya, kyonki unhone nivedita menon ko bolne ke liye bulaayaa tha, kuch nahin hua
 What does Nivedita Menon say that shakes the foundation of the Indian Republic? ham itnaa kamazor kab se ho gaye hai
 You don't know who did what after the crowd became more turbulent
 mul sawaal se sab bhatak jate hai or phir baat jeenyu par pahunchati he, kashmir par jaati he, vahaan se laut kar deshbhakti par aa jaati he
 Through these things, the killers are saved or the accused are confounded
 sirf naare sunai dete hai
 Those who kill are saved with the help of these slogans
 jeenyu kaa zikr hua he to lage haath bataa dete hai
 Last year was the February incident
 kitna bavaal hua tha
 The media and political parties clashed with each other leaving all work
 jis mudde ko lekar abhi or isi vakt faisla ho rahaa tha, wo ab kahaan hai
 In Vyapam scam, admission of 634 students studying MBBS was canceled
 inaki zindagi ek tarah se barbaad ho gai
 These students also took advantage of the system and the people associated with the system earned crores through these students
 kya aapane kisi bhi dal ke chaatr sanghathan ko 634 medical chaatro ko shikaar banane vaale system ke khilaaf bharat mata kii jai yaa laal salaam salaam ke naare lagaate dekha he
 Have seen someone spewing fire on the question of employment
 tippaniyan Omar Khalid is on the vine
 ek saal se aarope patr nahin bana or na hi trial
 So can you consider him a punishment? umr kalid bastar main adivaasiyon ke virodh pradarshan par piechdi kar rahe hai
 Went to speak on this agar mauka miltaa to ve kya bolte
 The second speech at Ramjas College was by Maya Rao
 maaya raav kaa vishay tha bodies in protest
 For the general audience, this will be a heavy topic, but understand this that many people are discriminated against due to their body texture
 samalangik samaaj apane adhikaron ke liye jab ladata he to us ladaai ke centre main wo sharir hi hota he jise lekar ham tarah-tarah kii betuki dharanaen banaate hai
 Maya Krishna Rao is a theater artist
 unhone ramajas main bataaya ki aam virodh pradarshnon or theatre yaa naatak ke zariye pradarshnon main kya antar hota he
 There was a strong performance in America under the name 'acupai Wall Street'
 ek vishay tha accupai campus
 When a woman comes to the campus, she does not get a chance to equalize
 is vishay par bolne vaali sristi shrivastav kaa maananaa he ki ladakiyon ke liye campus ko loktantric banaaya janaa chahie
 Srishti runs a 'cage break' campaign
 jaise ladke hostel main der raat bhi laut sakate hai, ladkiyaan shaam ko baahar hi nahin ja sakati
 The cage break raises such a subject

 So both of them escaped from the house last night

 During this, it was revealed that Sanjay has not returned to his house since evening
 parijan gaanvvaalon ke saath milakar donon ko talash karte rahe lekin ve donon kisi ko nahin mili
 On Friday morning, the villagers saw a young woman lying on the railway line near Keelashkabirpur

 Gosaiganj Police Station Arvind Kumar Pandey told that the families of both have been informed

 In such a situation, posters of many universities and colleges have started appearing on the streets of Delhi
 lekin kya aap jaanate he ki inamen se kai college ujisi se manyata pranyata praapt nahin hai yani farji hai, jahaan lakhon rupee kharch karne ke baad bhi naukari kii koi guaranti nahin
 There are lots of banners and advertisements all around
 jahaan najar daalo vahaan aapke bhavishya ko banane ke bade-bade daawey kiye ja rahe hai
 But these are the colleges and universities that are playing with the future of the youth
 ghar baithe ek saal main bie karen, agar aap baharaveen fail he to bhi aap teacher ban sakate hai
 One can easily get attracted to these promises
 lekin isse pehle ki aap bhi inke jhaanse main funs jaae, jaraa thahrie
 
 
 Do you know that these are colleges or universities which are not recognized by UGC
 darasal ujisi kii website par dilli ke 6 aise vishvavidhyalayon ke naam hai jinka sanchaalan avaidh rup se dilli main ho rahaa he
 According to the UGC, there are names of fake universities running in Delhi
 1
 Varanasi Sanskrit University 2
 commercial uniwarsity3
 United Nation University 4
 vokational uniwarsity5
 ADR University and 6
 iiesai uniwarsityin vishvavidhyalayon kii hakeekat jaanane ke liye jab aaj tak ne padtaal kii to zyaadaatar vishvavidhyalayon ke pate farji nikle
 Commercial University is running on the second floor in the post office building of Daryaganj, that too in only one hall
 yahaan pahunchakar staff se baat karne par pataa chalaa ki uniwarsity kai saal pehle band ho chuki he
 These fake universities have their own arguments but the UGC website is enough to open their pole
 jaankaron kaa bhi maananaa he ki in collejon ke jhaanse main agar aa gaye to inke jaal se nikalnaa mushkil he
 When it comes to your future, a little mistake can become a big problem in the future
 time ke diarector ulhas vairagkar kehete hai, kai baar chaatr hamaare paas aate hai ki hamaara score acha nahin he lekin unke paas patr aate hai unhen daakhila mil rahaa, lekin main kahuunga ki jo aasaani se ho us college kii degree kii kya ahmiyat hogi
 There is a lot of fussing about the future of the students
 shikshan santhaan ujisi se manyata praapt nahin hone ke baad in chaatro ko kya bhavishya denge
 There are many such colleges running between the narrow streets of Delhi which not only guarantee to pass but also assure to get a job
 lekin hakikat kuch or hi he
 To find out the claims of these fake universities, the answer received from a place on the phone was astonishing
 phone par us vyakti ne bataaya ki fail hone ke baavjood bhi hamen bie kii degree dilaa degen
 But the degree awarded will not be from a UGC recognized university
 in farji vishvavidhyalayon ke bharose bina mehnat ghar baithe aap graduate to ban jaaenge
 But this is the degree that cannot get you a good job anywhere
 aise college or vishvavidhyalay paise kamaane ke liye aapke bhavishya ke saath khilwaad kar rahe hai, unhen safal naa hone den
