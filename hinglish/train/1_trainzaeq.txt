 isse pehle nitin gadakari paanch rajyon main haar kii jimmedaari netritv ko lene kii baat kah chuke hai
 Sanghpriya Gautam said on Sunday that changes in government and organization are necessary to save the party

 These steps were heavy on the BJP, citing the reason for the falling graph of the party and the government, saying, talk of changing the constitution, tampering with the constitution, turning the Planning Commission into a NITI Aayog, interfering in constitutional organizations like Supreme Court, RBI, CBI etc
 , Decisions in the economic sector adversely affected

 bahut kam logon ko pataa hoga ki bollywood abhinayta arshad varsi bahut accho dancer or behtareen koreographer (nrity nirdeshak) bhi hai
 Despite this, Arshad often does not get to show his dance in films
 ve kehete hai ki aane vaali filmon ‘chance pe dance’ or shortcircuit main bhi unhen naachne kaa mauka nahin mil paa rahaa he
 Arshad says, 'what can i do? i love dancing and i dance well but the directors don't let me dance
 maine kai baar unase kaha ki mujhe filmon main dance karne kaa mauka den lekin unhone ise andekha kar diya

 The stir has increased with the union co-stewards Krishna Gopal reaching Varanasi

 Special responsibility is being given to the 40 city-stewards of Kashi area for the election
 banaras or purvanchal me tikaton ke bantwaare se party cader me baari naaraazgi he, josang kobhi pareshaan kar rahaa he
 The Sangh does not want the division of Hindu votes, so it has given its full strength
 bihar chunaav kii galati sangh doharaana nahi chahta
 This is the reason that the Sangh has taken over the command of persuading angry leaders
 bharat or pakistan ke bich hone vaale bahucharchit mukaable se pehle shanivaar ko bhartiya captain viraat kohli ne kaha ki vah apana dhyaan tej gendbaaj mohammad aamir ke saath hone vaale vyaktigat pratispardhaa par kendrit nahin kar rahe hai
 Kohli said that he and the team will focus on players other than Aamir
 saath hi unhone soshal media par chal rahe jang jaise maahaul par kaha ki samarthakon ko maahaul kaa lutf uthaanaa chahie
 Kohli said before the match, 'I will not say anything for TRP
 ' kohli ne kaha, 'aapako har gendbaaj kii kaabiliyat kii kadra kerani chahie
 You should be confident of your ability to score runs against any bowler
 main sirf red ball yaa white ball cricket par apana dhyaan kendrit karata hum
 There are other 10 players who can make their impact on the match
 'kohli ne kaha, 'aisa nahin he ki main score karuunga or wo wicket lenge tabhi match haare or jite jaaenge
 For the best results, the remaining 10 players from both teams will also have to play better
 mere dimag main kisi ek khilaadi ko lekar pratispardhaa nahin he or main nahin samajhataa ki mujhe kisi ko kuch sabit karne kii jarurat he
 For me it is quite simple, if you do not play well then you will also be dismissed part time bowler
 'champiens trophy main bharat ko mili thi haradonon tiimon ke bich isse pehle isisi champiens trophy ke final main muqabla hua tha
 In the final, Aamir showed India's top order the way to the pavilion
 aamir ne shikhar dhawan, rohit sharma or kohli ko pehle nau over ke andar hi nipta diya tha or bhartiya team wo match 180 ranon se haari thi
 Aamir's form has fallen a bit since then, but he has raised the concern of Indian batsmen by taking 5 wickets against Australia
 kohli ne yah bhi nahin bataaya ki kya vah agle match main gendbaaji kram main koi parivartan karenge yaa nahin
 He said, 'we will think of different bowling combinations according to the circumstances
 agar atirikt tej gendbaaj vikalp he to ham usapar bhi sochenge
 If the match is short, it will also be considered
 'apni takat ke mutabik khelnaa hoga- kohlikohali ne kaha ki dressing room main sabhi khilaadiyon kii maansik sthiti waisi hi he jaisi kisi duusare vanade match se pehle hoti he na ki maidan se baahar bane maahaul jaisi
 He said, 'we have not talked anything different since we arrived in England
 dressing room kaa maahaul badla nahin he
 The atmosphere of the dressing room is similar to previous encounters
 ham samajhate hai ki ham desh ke liye ham koi bhi match khelen usase bhavanaaen judi rahati hai
 Kohli said, "as a cricketer, we have been selected to play for the country, our responsibility is to take every match equally, no matter the opposition
" hamaare liye kuch bhi nahin badla he
 We are the top team because we have played that kind of cricket
 hamen is baat ko yaad rakhana hoga
 So our discussion has not changed
 hamen apni takat ke mutabik khelnaa hoga jaisaa ki ham pichley maichon main karte aae hai
 Kohli's response to the ad war has created an atmosphere like this match is going to be war, especially on social media where different advertisements are being run by the two countries
 kohli se jab poocha gaya ki wo samarthakon ko kya sandesh dena chahenge to captain ne kaha ki unhen maahaul kaa lutf uthaanaa chahie
 Kohli said, 'we hope that the stadium will be full and fans will enjoy the match
 vishwa cap main har match main stadium bhare hote hai
 So it is not at all different for us as a player
 'daaen haath ke is ballebaaj ne kaha, 'maine samarthakon se is nishchit disha main sochane ke bare main nahin kah saktaa
 a player's mind is different from a pro's
 aap in donon ko mila nahin sakate
 You cannot expect fans to think of it in a professional way
 prashansakon ko match kaa lutf uthaanaa chahie, jis tarah se vah pehle ke dinon se uthaate aa rahe hai, lekin ek khilaadi ke taur par hamen peshewar rahanaa chahie

 Mobile phones will continue to be decided according to the situation and landline service has been restored everywhere

 He said that it is up to the people to make the situation better

 Not only this, he said that the supporter of 370 will kill him with public shoes

 beshak aatankiinternet or mobile phone kaa bhi istemaal karata he, lekin isi tark se internet puure desh main band ho janaa chahie
 Should be closed from the world itself
 kam se kam baccha chori kii afvaah se lekar sampradayik baaten rose fail rahi hai, to kya internet se lekar mobile phone band kar diya jaae
 The situation in Jammu and Kashmir is special, but people are also suffering due to internet and mobile phones coming to a standstill
 aaj hi is vajah se ek chaatr ne supreme court main guhaar lagaai ki use apane maa-baap se baat nahin ho paa rahi he
 Want to go there aaj hi sipiem mahasachiv sadsy ko apni party ke sadsy kaa haal poochne ke liye jane ke liye court se anumati maangani padi
 The Supreme Court has allowed CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury to go to Kashmir to meet his party leader Mohammad Yusuf Tarigami
 tarigami hiraasat main hai
 This was opposed by Solicitor General Tushar Mehta
 umhone kaha ki yechuri ko rajya suraksha degaa to court kaa jawaab tha ki isaki aavashyaktaa nahin he
 But the court also said that Sitaram Yechury cannot participate in any activity other than meeting
 kisi bhi duusari gatividhi ko adaalat ke aadesh kaa ullaghan samajha jayega
 Sitaram Yechury filed the petition on 19 August
 isi yachika ke saath ek kashmiri chaatr mohammad aleem syed kii yachika par bhi sunwaayee hui
 Syed was unable to contact his parents, so he approached the Supreme Court
 court ne kaha ki syed anantnag jaakar apane mata-pita se mil sakate hai
 The state has been ordered to provide security to Syed
 donon maamalon kii sunwaayee chif justise ranjan gogai or justise ese bobade or justise es abdul nazir kii bench main ho rahi thi
 Another petition was that of Anuradha Bhasin, executive editor of Kashmir Times
 unhone kaha ki blike out kaa 25waan din he
 The Supreme Court has sought a response from the government within 7 days
 anuraadhaa bhasin ne maang kii thi ki anuchhed 370 ko hataane ke baad vahaan internet or phone sevaayen band hai
 For this reason, there is no environment for fearless and fair reporting
 10 agast ko yachika daayar kii thi
 Surprisingly, after his petition, the Press Council of India intervenes in the Supreme Court and says that he wants to help the court on this petition
 press council ne apni aachaar samhita kii 23 kaa hawala dete hue kaha ki samvedansheel rashtriya muddon par patrkaar or akhabaaron ko khud se ankush lagaana chahie taaki rashtrahit ko khatara na pahunche
 Several press journalists criticized the decision of the Press Council of India
 indian express or da hindu main apane sampadakeey main is kadam par hairaani jataai or aalochana kii
 In a statement issued by the Editors Guild of India, the institution that protects the freedom of the media should talk for the freedom of the press but on the contrary it is supporting the curbing of the media
 ajeeb he ki vah kisi khaas paristhiti ke naam par pathakon ko andhere main rakhe jane kaa samarthan karata he
 The Guild has expected Press Council of India Chairman Justice CK Prasad to withdraw his decision
 vah apni sanstha ke naitik bal kaa prayog karte hue media par lage ankush ko hataane main madad karnaa chahie
 Not a literal translation
 ab khabar yah he ki press council of india ne apana stand badalane kaa faisla liya he
 Now the council says it is with freedom of the press
 media par kisi haq ke saath nahin he
 On the other hand, a lot happened in the Supreme Court today
 manohar laal sharma kii yachika par sunwaayee karte hui anuchhed 370 hataae jane kii yachika samvidhan peeth ko saunp di gai he, jis par aktubar ke pehle hafte se sunwaayee hogi
 The Attorney General told the court not to issue notice in this matter, it is a very sensitive matter
 duusare desh iskaa phayda uthaa sakate hai
 So the Supreme Court said that the notice has been issued
 ham aadesh main badlaav nahin karenge
 We know but what do we do
 baat bhi sahi he ki kal ko pakistan akhbaar kii kating nikaalkar kahaan istemaal karegaa, is dar se tab to akhbaar hi chapana band ho jaae
 Another petition was heard in the Supreme Court today, but the effect of this fear was seen on politics
 pakistan ne sanyukt raashtra kii yachika main rahul gandhi ke bayaan kaa udhaaharan de diya rahul gandhi ne subah twit kiya ki main kai muddon par sarkaar se asahmat hum
 But, i want to make it very clear that Kashmir is an internal matter of India and there is no scope for interference of Pakistan or any other country
 jammu-kashmir main hinsa ho rahi he, lekin ye hinsa isliye he, kyonki duniya bhar main aatankwaad ke mukhya samarthak pakistan dwaara ise uksaaya ja rahaa he or samarthan diya ja rahaa he
 Governor Malik said that he would give these clarifications only when the Congress leader in the Lok Sabha spoke to the United Nations
 tab kyon nahin safai di
 The Congress press conference was saying something different on this
 aisa lag rahaa tha ki congress kisi aparaadh bodh se nikalne kii koshish kar rahi he or jor-jor se aatankwaad ke peeche pakistan kii bhoomika ko doharaa rahi he
 From there she reached Baluchistan
 magar bijepi kii taraf se soochna prasaaran mantri prakaash jaavdekar ne press conferes kii or kaha ki rahul maange
 On behalf of the Congress, Randeep Surjewala held a press conference and said that Prakash Javadekar should apologize
 tazaa samachar milane tak donon ne maafee nahin maangi thi
 With this logic, neither the newspaper should be printed or the TV should be played, because Pakistan will use it
 bharat ek loktantric desh he
 Here the Supreme Court has given notice to the government on the question of curb on the media
 court main bhi kaha gaya ki notice jari na karen, koi istemaal kar sake
 So should the Supreme Court not do constitutional work that Pakistan will be used
 ab baat karte hai bhartiya prashasnic seva se istipha dene vaale kann gopinathan se
 Kannan resigned over the fact that the people of Kashmir were not getting the right to express their reaction
 jis tarah se sarkaar ke paas kadam uthaane kaa adhikaar he, usee tarah se logon ke paas adhikaar hona chahie ki ve bhi pratikriya vyakt karen
 He was disturbed by the country's silence on this question and resigned

 paanch saal kii lambii maut ke baad duniya kaa sabase khoonkhaar aatankwaadi abu bakar al bagdadi ek baar phir zindaa ho gaya he
 Has been alive, to tell that the serial blasts on the occasion of Easter in Sri Lanka were done by him
 ye dhamaake syria main hui uski haar kaa badla tha
 On 29 April, isis's media wing released an 18-minute video claiming that Baghdadi is not dead, but alive
 4 july 2014iraq kii al nuri masjid
 Baghdadi was last seen
 phir uske aatankiyon ne machaai tabaahi
 The militants and the army fought
 khun kii nadiyaan bahane lageen
 The shadow of terror completely prevailed over Iraq and Syria
 is dauraan kai baar uski maut kii khabare ain
 Then he suddenly went missing
 29 april 2019puure 4 saal 10 maheene 5 din baad jari hua he duniya main aatank ke sabase bade aakaa kaa sabase nayaa video
 The world is seeing ISIS kingpin Abu Bakr al-baghdadi again 1771 days later
 ye sirf doosraa mauka he jab bagdadi duniya ke saamne aayaa he
 That too when the world had agreed that Baghdadi was dead
 par kya sachmuch ye bagdadi hi he? kya ye video sahi he? ye video kahaan ricard kii gai? kab kii gai? to philhal america samet duniya bhar kii agenciyaan bagdadi ke is sabase nae video kii asaliyat kii chaanbin kar rahi hai
 Trying to find out whether this Baghdadi is really alive? However, the media wing of ISIS claims that Baghdadi is alive and the person in the video is Baghdadi
 iesas kii media wing al-phurkan ne hi 29 april 2019 ko ye video jari kiya he
 So is Baghdadi alive even after the tons of bombings from Iraq to Syria and spending thousands of crores of dollars? Should this video be considered proof of Baghdadi being alive? Because experts believe that the person seen in the video is exactly the same as Baghdadi
 teen tasviren saamne ai hai
 All three photos are of Abu Bakr al Baghdadi
 pehali tasviir iesas ke gathan se pehle kii he
 When in 2010 he became the leader of Al Qaeda in Iraq
 duusari tasviir saal 2014 kii he, jab iesas ke vajood main aane ke baad mosul kii al-nuri masjid se usne duniya ke naam sandesh diya tha
 And proclaimed himself Khalifa
 or teesri or sabase tazaa tasviir 29 april 2019 kii he
 All three pictures are of different times and circumstances
 magar gaur se dekhne par saaf pataa chal rahaa he ki ye ek hi shaks kii hai
 And that is from Baghdadi
 teenon chehre kii ankhen or bhaven ek jaisi hai
 Nose is the same
 hont or uske upar kaa hissaa ek jaisaa
 However, the difference of age is visible in all the three pictures
 ab isaki daadhee pak chuki he
 Facial glow is missing
 jhurriyon ke nishaan saaf nazar aa rahe hai
 Now after the face, notice the voice of Baghdadi
 pehle video (4 july 2014) main mosul main die uske bhaashan tha or doosraa video 29 april 2019 kaa he
 Apart from this, Baghdadi has also been claimed to release audio several times in the last 5 years
 is nae video main aies sargana bagdadi zamin par bichhi ek gaddi par baitha hua he
 Bagdadi is wearing a black cloth over his head in dark clothes and white jacket
 uske bagal main tech lagane ke liye kushan he or peeche automatic raifal nazar aa rahi he
 To hide the identity of the room in which Baghdadi is seated, white cloth is hung on the walls
 bagdadi ke alaava is kamare main teen or log bhi baithe hai
 But nobody's face is shown in the video
 in teen main se do ne cheharaa dhakaa hua jabaki tisare ke chehre ko dhundhala kar diya gaya he
 In this 18-minute video, Baghdadi is instructing these three henchmen
 saath hi ye aatanki apane aakaa ko alag alag report dikhaa rahe hai
 Whom he is checking video ke aakhir main easter sande par srilanka main hue dhamaake kii tasviren dikhaai gai hai
 It also has a video of those eight terrorists
 jise srilanka main hue serial blast ke baad soshal media par jari kiya gaya tha
 Now the question is why after five years of silence, Baghdadi has suddenly released this video? What does he want to tell the world through this video? So the answers to these questions are in this 18 minute video
 video main bagdadi ne syria ke shahar baguj kii haar kaa zikr kiya he
 Baguj was the last territory of Syria occupied by IS
 isi saal march main baguj se bagdadi ke aatanki bhaag khadey hue the
 Apart from this, Baghdadi mentions four incidents of April 3, April 9, April 11 and April 21 in the same video
 in ghatnaon kaa zikr karke bagdadi ye yakeen dilaanaa chahta he ki video purana nahin balki nayaa he or wo mara nahin balki jinda he
 The connection of these terrorist attacks on Easter Sunday in Sri Lanka is connected to the Syrian city of Baguz, 5000 km away
 iraq or syria main iesas ke sabase bade or sabase puraane is garh par isi saal 9 farvari se 23 march tak america or sahyogi deshon kii senaaon ke alaava iraqi or syrian sena ne itane bam barasaaye ki is ilaake se aatank kii jaden hi ukhd gayi
 And from then on ISIS was flirting to avenge this attack
 video main kaha gaya "srilanka main hue dhamaake isi kaa badla he
 We are happy that our brothers in Sri Lanka broke into their homes on Easter and killed them and avenged the martyrdom of their brothers killed in Baguze
 is hamale kii jad main ek hazaar se zyaada log aae hai
 Which includes American and European people
 main srilanka main hamalaa karne ke liye apane bhaiyon kii prashansa karata hum
 "it is possible that this video of Baghdadi is old
 magar usamen srilanka main hue blast kaa zikr kar ke use nayaa video bataane kii koshish kii gai ho
 Because in the video, when the attack in Sri Lanka was being talked about
 us vakt video main bagdadi ke chehre kii jagah srilanka main hue hamale kii tasviren dikhaai gai hai
 However, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was re-elected Prime Minister through Baghdadi to make this video new and to prove Baghdadi alive
 algerian raashtrapati abdul azeez ke istife or sudan ke raashtrapati omar-al bashir ke takhtapalat kaa bhi zikr kiya gaya he
 These three incidents are in the month of April this year
 9 april ko israel main hue chunaav kaa nateeja aayaa
 On 3 April, Algerian President Abdul Aziz resigned from his post
 11 april ko sudan ke raashtrapati omar-al bashir kaa takhta palat kar diya gaya
 And on 21 April, there was a serial blast in Sri Lanka

 Taking a dig at Giriraj, Modi said in support of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar that whether Ram Navami is worshiped or Navratri, Holi Milan or Iftar, Nitish Kumar not only participates in everything but even if the talk is about organizing Do not move

 khaskar 2014 ke chunaav ko lekar party kii chintaa he ki agar lalu prasad yadav ko chaara ghotaale main sajaa hoti he to un paristhiyon main party kaa kya rukh hoga

 This is not the case like 2014
 2014 se ab bilkul alag halaat hai
 When PM Modi came here in the last election, people had expectations from him but now after five years, some people who are not happy with his work will have to face it
 kaashi (varanasi) ke logon ko unase badi ummiden thim
 PM Modi (PM Modi) had also greatly enlarged his dreams
 unhone kaashi (varanasi)ko kioto banane kaa vaada kiya tha
 But how much those dreams on the ground turned into reality, these questions will also have to be answered by Kashi's MP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi (PM Modi)
 piem modi ne varanasi main kai hazaar karod rupee kii yojanaayen lekar aae
 He reached his parliamentary constituency 19 times in the last 5 years and laid the foundation stone and inaugurated many schemes but till now many works are incomplete
 inamen sadak bijli, pani, siver jaisi moolbhoot samasyaayein bhi thi jo varanasi ke bhitari ilaake main nahin sudhar pai hai
 The ring road on the outskirts of the city has changed, due to which the single-lane Banaras have got four-lane roads
 iske alaava duusari chunautiyaan bhi hai
 Most banias in Banaras3
 25 lakh he, jo vaise to bijepi ke kor voter maane jate hai or 2014 main inhone bad-chadh kar bhaag bhi liya tha lekin is baar notebandi or jiesti se yah naaraaz hai
 There is a very big section in it which modi-modi does in front but he is angry inside
 iske baad brahmanon kii sankhya bhi dhai lakh he, jo kabhi congress kaa mul voter the lekin saal 1989 se ye voter bijepi ke saath hai
 However, in 2004, Rajesh Mishra of Congress won this vote in his favor and since then he has been with BJP continuously, but this time the houses of most Brahmins in the Vishwanath Corridor are broken, so this section is very angry
 ye shahar kaa dakshini ilaaka he jise bijepi kii bakabon kahi jaati he
 But this time it is very angry which can cause harm
 banaras galiyon ke saath ghaaton kaa bhi shahar he ganga ke kinare in 84 ghaaton par hazaron kii sankhya main nishad birdari ke log rahete hai
 This fraternity was associated with PM Modi with high hopes in 2014, but in the last five years, he got very disappointed
 ye birdari maanati hai ki in paanch saalon main wo sabase zyaada apni rozi roti ko bachaane ke liye sangharsh karti rahi kyonki kabhi ganga main cruge chalaa kar unki jeevika kii jo chot kii gai us par andolan to khub hua lekin sarkaar ne inaki ek na suni
 They may have to face their displeasure too
 nishadon kii tarah yadav birdari kaa bhi 1 lakh 50 hazaar vot he jo pichley kai chunaav se bijepi ko hi vot kar rahaa tha lekin is baar wo akhilesh yadav ke saath khadaa nazar aa rahaa he
 Dalits are around 80 thousand and Muslims around three lakh
 2014 ke chunaav main sapa-basapa alag-alag ladi thi or muslim kejariwal kii taraf chalaa gaya tha jisase wo 2 lakh 9 hazaar vot paae the
 Now if these votes come together then there can be a challenge that you cannot ignore
 saafe he ki piem modi ke liye ye chunaav jitna aasaan dikh rahaa he utana aasaan he nahin or is baat ko piem modi bakhubi samajhate hai isiilie wo kaaryakarta sammelan main apane kaaryakartaaon ko zyaada se zyaada vot nikalwane kii apil kar gaye hai
 The BJP has released the list of candidates for most of the seats for the Lok Sabha Election
 mangalvaar ko bhi siton kaa bantwaaraa hota rahaa, or sansadeey kshetron kii adla-badali chalati rahi
 In such a situation, the names of potential candidates of many cities were also cut
 sabase zyada sansadeey kshetra vaala rajya uttar pradesh main bhaajapa ne 29 ummidavaaron ke naam kaa elaan kar diya he
 Many candidates changed their cities, while some candidates also cut their tickets
 inamen se kuch ne niraashaa main apni bhadaas nikaali to kaiyon ne party ke samarthan main prachaar-prasar karne ke liye sahmati jataai
 In the ticket distribution done by BJP in UP, who knows the name of Kata and who got the ticket? barabanki se priyanka ravat kaa tikat kataa, vahiin baliya saasand bharat singh kaa bhi tikat kataa
 Shyama Charan Gupta was ticketed from Prayagraj as he joined the Samajwadi Party
 unki jagah bijepi ne reeta bahuguna ko prayagraj se tikat diya
 At the same time, Nepal Singh was ticketed from Rampur and replaced Jayaprada, the actress and leader who joined BJP on Tuesday

 hukum singh kii beti mriganka singh kaa bhi tikat kataa, jabaki unki jagah pradeep kumaar ko tikat diya
 However, Mrigaka's supporters also expressed displeasure by putting up posters as the ticket was cut, as they were likely to get tickets from Kairana

 After the conversation between the two leaders, it was the turn to take a formal photograph for which all the press photographers were present
 rivaaz ke mutabik donon deshon ke pramukhon ko ek duusare se haath milaate hue tasviir khinchvaani thi
 This time too, the photographers asked the two leaders for a 'handshake' but Trump did not listen to this
 jab trump ne press ke nivedan ko ansuna kiya to khud angela ne trump se kaha ki 'ye log hamase handshek karne ke liye kah rahe hai
 Despite this, Trump did not even look away from him to join hands with Merkel

 agar nai shiksha niti (eneepi) 2019 kaa masauda uski pariklpana ke mutabik 2035 tak amal main aa jaataa he to kya hoga? ise 31 may ko nau sadasyon kii ke
 The Kasturirangan Committee has assigned the Union Ministry of Human Resources
 aaie, ab kalpana karen ki 2032 main paidaa hue rohan kii jindagi kaise aage badhegi
 When he is three years old, he will be admitted to formal education under the framework of 5 + 3 + 3 + 4
 pehle teen saal use skool purv talim milegi—kam se kam teen bhashaaon main—or vah bhi use prashikshit shikshak denge
 During this time he will learn kakhara, numerals, colors and shapes, solve puzzles and deal with drama, puppet games, music and action
 koi pathyapustak nahin hogi, sari padhai-likhaai khel-khel main or prayogtmak hogi, or aise skool parisar main hogi jahaan saaf-suthere shauchalay, lambey-chaude kamare, ity sakasham gajet, khilne kii kaaphi chijen or hansi-khushi kaa maahaul hoga
 In classes 1 to 5, he will get time to study in fixed hours and learn mathematics because by the fifth grade he will have to acquire basic knowledge of letters and numbers
 agar rohan kii koi 'khaas ruchi' or / yaa 'pratibha' he—vah ganit, khel, painting yaa acting main ho sakati he—to shikshak use pahachaanenge or viksit karne ke liye maargdarshan or protsaahan denge
 From class 6 onwards, Rohan will not have to worry about the syllabus and other activities related to the syllabus as all subjects from mathematics to sports and music and painting will be part of the syllabus
 vah apni dilchaspee ke vishay chun saktaa he
 Of course, there will be some common compulsory subjects
 is paaydaan par use kuch vyavsaayik prashikshan dene kii shuruyaat bhi hogi taaki vah tay kar sake ki kaksha 9 main pahunchane par koun-sa vyavsaayik vishay legaa
 During this time, he will be evaluated regularly through information technology and his learning graph will be recorded so that a proper plan can be made for him
 kaksha 3, 5 or 8 ke aakhir main imtihaan honge taaki uski aalochanatmak soch kii kshamta or uski bhashaa tathaa ganit ke hunar ko mapa ja sake
 From class 9, Rohan will give online board examination of three subjects in a six-month semester
 is pariksha kaa khaakaa is tarah taiyaar kiya jayega jisase mul vishyon kii uski samaj kii parakh ho, na ki uske yaad rakhane yaa ratane ke hunar kii
 He may appear for the board examination twice a year or perhaps even more often
 rohan jab kaksha 12 puri kar letaa he, tab vah apane ghar ke paas ke kisi bhi college yaa uniwarsity main ja saktaa he, kyonki achche ucch shiksha santhaan desh ke harek jile main khole jaaenge
 They will offer three-year or four-year regular courses or vocational courses
 vikalp ke taur par yah bhi ho saktaa he ki vyavsaayik prashikshan uske degree course main hi samahit kar diya jaae
 It won't be like the 2020s when you have to pick a stream — all degrees will be multidisciplinary, allowing them to study physics with history, for example
 agar rohan peshewar course se judsa chahta he, to vah kisi bhi uniwarsity main ja sakegaa kyonki ve sabhi bahuvishayak hongi
 So while studying engineering or medical degree, he can also take up the subject of social science and find out how his degree can have a good impact on his local and global environment
 degree course ke aakhri saal main rohan research kaa vikalp chun saktaa he yaa teen saal kaa degree course puraa karne ke baad ek saal research kar saktaa he
 In this way, he will be able to enter phd without studying first master's degree, although he can also opt for doctorate after master's degree
 use, yaa uske santhaan ko, uski research ke liye dhan kii phikr nahin kerani padegi kyonki agar uskaa project sthaneey, rashtriya yaa vaishvik muddon se judaa ho to project kaa kharch neshnal research foundation uthayega
 If Rohan does not want to remain in the academic world for so long, he will have many options, during that four-year-long liberal degree that will prepare him for the 21st century knowledge economy
 yah ek shuruaati jhalak bhar he ki eneepi 2035 tak desh kii shiksha pranali ko kis tarah amulchul badalanaa chaahati he
 This 484-page document outlines a detailed plan that includes pre-school, school and higher education as well as vocational, adult and teacher training and manuals
 yah nae raste banane vaale kuch sudhaaron kaa bhi suzav detaa he, masalan skulon main shuruaati bachapan kii shiksha kaaryakramon ko majboot karnaa, shikshak prashikshan kaaryakramon par dhyaan dena, skool paathyakramon main vyavsaayik course jodpha, ucch shiksha main research ke liye dhan jutaney ko badhaava dena or ucch shiksha main gunatmak badlaavon kii khatir sheersh niamkeey nikaayon kaa punargathan karnaa or nae nikaay bananaa
 Ashish Dhawan, founder and chairman of Central Square Foundation, a non-profit organization working in the field of school education, says, "NEP has made some bold and welcoming recommendations to change focus for improving student educational outcomes
" lekin ham agar sabhi bacchon ko akshar or ankon ke buniyadi hunar se las karnaa pakkaa kar lete hai—to is akele prayaas kaa shiksha pranali par jabardast asar hoga
 "to read and to be counted The suggestion that will bring about a paradigm shift of NEP 2019 is to include pre-school education in the framework of formal education
 eneepi vaigyanik skool purv shiksha kii vakaalat karti he or iske liye neurosience kii research kaa hawala detii he ki bachche ke mastishk kaa 85 fisadi vikaas 6 saal kii umr se pehle ho jaataa he
 It also cites a 1992 study by the National Council for Education Research and Training (NCERT) on 30,000 children for pre-school education and dropout and attendance rates and, most importantly, primary school and above education
 There is a direct correlation between the results
 skool purv shiksha kaa asar vyaktiyon or deshon ke aarthik vikaas par bhi padataa he
 Santosh Mehrotra, an economics professor at JNU, cites a research that the lifetime earnings of people who get education in childhood are higher than those who were deprived of education in childhood
 eneepi kaa anumaan he ki skool purv shiksha main kiye gaye 1 rupye ke nivesh ke badale desh ko 10 rupye kaa pratifal milegaa
 Simultaneously, research also suggests that children under 8 are not prepared for textbook-oriented education
 iskaa arth he ki hamaare bacchon ke bahut bade hisse ko vah shiksha nahin mil rahi he jisaki unhen jarurat he
 At present, most of the early childhood education is being given by Anganwadis and private pre-schools
 ekikrut bal vikaas sevaaon (isidies) ke tahat chalaai ja rahi anganwadiawon ne maataaon or shishuon kii swasthya dekhbhaal ke lihaaj se achche nattejey die hai, magar shiksha ke maamle main gachha diya he
 Private pre-schools provide better infrastructure, but their curriculum and methods of teaching are not what is needed for early childhood education
 isamen tajjub nahin ki ambedkar uniwarsity ke 2017 ke ek adhyayan main pataa chalaa ki sarkari yaa nijee kisi bhi sanstha se purv praathmik shiksha puri karne vaale hindustan ke bacchon kii badi taadaad praathmik skool main daakhile ke kaabil nahin thi
 The 2018 Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) survey found that 50 percent of Class 5 students were able to read Class 2 textbooks
 so, sakal namakan anupaat kaksha 1-5 ke 95 fisadi se ghatakar kaksha 9-10 main 79 fisadi par aa gaya
 That is why the highest priority of NEP is to achieve universal basic literacy and numerology in primary schools and beyond by 2025
 eneepi kaa masauda kahata he, ''agar yah sabase buniyadi shiksha—aadharbhoot str par padhuya, likhnaa or ankaganit—pehle hasil nahin kii jaati, to hamaare chaatro ke itane bade hisse ke liye baaki kii niti mote taur par apraasangik hogi
 "it must also be ensured that all students between the ages of 3 to 18 years are brought under the purview of the Child Rights (amendment) 2019 for free and compulsory education
" eneepi yah bhi sifarish karti he ki maujuuda 10+2 ke model kii jagah ek 5+3+3+4 kaa paathyakram or shiksha kaa vaigyanik dhaancha laayaa jaae jo bachche ke sangyanatmak or saamaajik-bhaavnaatmak vikaas kii avasthaaon par aadhaarit ho
 It recommends that the three years of pre-school (3-6 years old) be combined into classes 1 and 2 (up to the age of 8) to make it a scientific education unit that will be called the 'basic stage'
 kaksha 3-5 (umr 8-11 varsh) ko taiyaar charan kaha jayega, jiske baad kaksha 6-8 (umr 11-14 varsh) kaa madhyamik charan hoga or aakhir main kaksha 9-12 (umr 14-18 varsh) kaa ucchtar madhyamik charan hoga
 The draft NEP states that children under 8 learn languages faster and learning languages is a very important aspect of a child's cognitive development, so he recommends that many languages at this stage — at least three —get taught
 shikshashasthri alabatta isse ittefaq nahin rakhte
 "this is not right," says Maya Menon, founder of Bangalore-based The Teacher Foundation
 bacchon ko apni grih bhashaa / matra bhashaa main nipunata hasil karnaa jaruri he, khaskar padhgaye or likhane ke bhashaai hunar ke maamle main, or tab kahin jaakar ve duusari bhashaa kii aupchaarik padhai ke liye taiyaar ho sakate hai
 Taking the 1993 Historical Yashpal Committee Report 'learning Without Burden' (learning Without Burden), NEP seeks to reduce the burden of subject material and textbooks on students and discourage instant learning
 lihaaja, paathyakram kii ruparekha main jor pathyapustakon se seekhney par nahin balki iske bajaae apane haathon se karne, anubhav or vishleshan se seekhney par hoga
 All subjects including arts, music, handicrafts, sports, yoga and community service will be part of the course
 paathyakram bahubhasha, pracheen bhartiya gyaan paddatiyon, vaigyanik mizaaj, naitik vivek, saamaajik jimmedaari, digital sakshartaa or sthaneey samudaayon ke saamne maujuud behad ahm muddon kii jaankaree ko badhaava degaa
 Examination of the board will no longer be a life-defying and extremely stressful exercise
 kaksha 8 or 12 ke bich chaatr saal main do baar board kii parikshaayen de paaenge
 Later, when the computerized adaptive examination system is widely present, they will be allowed to take multiple exams, in at least 24 subjects, or three on average in a semester
 pariksha main keval mul kshamtaaon, buniyadi shiksha, hunar or vishleshan kii parakh kii jaaegi
 NEP says, "students should pass easily without coaching and rote
 'ek or avadharana, jo 1964 kii kothaari ayog kii report se lee gai he, skool parisaron kaa nirmaan karne kii he
 Government schools will be redesigned and converted into organizational and administrative units, called school premises
 inamen ek secondary skool (kaksha 9-12 tak) hoga or uske aasapaas kai duusare skool honge jo purv praathmik se kaksha 8 tak kii talim denge
 The school premises will have the autonomy to handle the academic and administrative matters of all the schools under them and will serve as the lowest rung of the school education system in the state
 parisar ke tamaam skool shikshakon ke ek saajha samooh kii sevaayen le sakenge, jisase kam shikshan sansadhano vaale skulon kii bharpai ho sakegi
 However, Pratham CEO Rukmini Banerjee feels that NEP does not have clear guidelines regarding schooling after the primary stage
 ve kahati hai, ''praathmik charan se upar aage kii pramukh baaten to likh di gai hai magar in baton kaa tanabana bunakar ek susangat or vyapak ruparekha banane ke liye or zyada kaam karne kii jarurat he
 Kiran Bhatti, Senior Fellow at the Center for Policy Research, says one more thing: "NEP has set many lofty goals but it does not say anything about typical grassroots capacity building starting from the school campus
 ''shikshak nirmaandhanchaagat or paathyakram se jude in badlaavon ke baavjood eneepi sweekaar karti he ki shikshak vah dhuree honge jinke chaaron taraf shiksha kii is kranti ko anjaam diya ja saktaa he
 Former NCERT director J
 es
 The Rajput is confident that if the teachers are empowered, then this policy will surely succeed
 ve kehete hai, ''shiksha or shikshakon ko unka haq do
 Trust the teachers, prepare them with professional methods and help them in carrying out their work
 yah is niti ke amal kii disha main pehla kadam hoga
 According to the NEP, in the future all teachers will achieve a compulsory liberal integrated bachelor's degree of four years and only then will they be able to sit for the recruitment test like Teacher Eligibility Test (TET)
 desh bhar main shikshakon ko shiksha dene vaali hajaaron kii taadaad main chal rahi sansthaaen band kar di jaaengi or keval bahuvishayak ucch shaikshanik sansthaaen hi bied kii degree dengi
 Maya Menon, however, feels inadequate and instead insists on exploring flexible methods and alternative avenues to achieve qualified teacher status, especially for professionals who join the workforce in the middle of their careers Want to ve kahati hai, ''nae sire se taiyaar shikshak prashikshan niti ko gunvattta ke halkaa kiye bagaiyr zyada udaar hone kii jarurat he, jahaan shikshak prashikshan ke vishvavidhyalay-aadhaarit bahu-vishyak college ek rasta ho sakate hai, vahiin jila shiksha or prashikshan sansthaanon (diiiti) kaa kya hoga?''yah niti shikshakon ko behatar kaamkaaji maahaul muhaiyaa karne kaa lakshya bhi tay karti he
 For example, they will be exempted from non-teaching government work such as holding elections, cooking midday meals and other labor-intensive administrative responsibilities
 asaadhaaran kaam karne vaale shikshakon ko manyata, padonnati or tankhwaah main badhotaree di jaaegi; unhen zyaadaatar unke grih nagar main hi niyukt kiya jayega; kaamkaaji maahaul, sansaadhan saamagree or prashikshan ke lihaaj se sahaayta di jaaegi; unki javabdehi banaae rakhane ke liye vakt-vakt par kaamkaaj kaa moolyankan kiya jayega
 However, critics say that this policy still leaves much to be done in deciding the accountability of teachers
 mehrotra kehete hai, ''shikshakon kii gaiyr-hajiri badi buraai he
 This policy does not offer any monitoring mechanism for teachers based on ground reality
 ''nalanda-takshashila modelaucch shiksha kshetra ke liye, eneepi main kuch gaganchumbi lakshya hai jaise 2035 tak sakal daakhila anupaat 50 pratishat (maujuuda 25 pratishat) karnaa, sabhi ucch shiksha sansthaanon (echii) ko swaittata or desh ke har jile main ek gunvattta vishvavidhyalay kholana
 To achieve these goals, NEP exemplifies the ancient Indian universities of Taxila and Nalanda, where thousands of students from all over the country and abroad were studying in a vibrant multi-disciplinary environment
 yah prastaav karti he ki 2030 tak, sabhi echii in teen main se kisi ek prakaar ke santhaan ban jaaen—anusandhan vishvavidhyalay, shikshan vishvavidhyalay or college
 a university would mean a multi-disciplinary HEI offering undergraduate and postgraduate programs with high-quality teaching, research and services
 vishvavidhyalay ek vishyak nahin honge; sabhi vishvavidhyalay, jinamein profeshnal uniwarsity bhi shaamil hai, bahu-vishyak honge
 Kasturirangan believes that this multi-disciplinary approach will prepare Indian students for future job markets
 ve kehete hai, ''yah sochen ki kritrim budhimatta (eani) jaise takneekee vikaas ke kaaran naukariyaan bahut badal sakati hai yaa gaayab ho sakati hai
 AI is gradually becoming capable of handling sophisticated domain-specific tasks, so it is necessary to integrate professional education and provide multi-disciplinary knowledge to prepare students to use their full capabilities in the new world Could
 ''yah dekhnaa bhi dilachasp hoga ki kya bhaajapa kii aguai vaali centre sarkaar udaaravaadi shiksha main chaar saal ke bahu-vishyak sïnaatak kii degree ko lagu karne ke prastaav ko sweekaar kar legi, jisamen kai nikaas vikalp or upyukt pramanikaran honge
 This would be on the same lines as former Delhi University vice-chancellor Dinesh Singh applied for a short time, but he was forced to withdraw due to opposition from the then HRD Minister Smriti Irani and the left-leaning faculty
 eneepi, haalanki, teen varshiya paaramparik snaatak degree ko jari rakhane kii bhi anumati detii he
 NEP also understands that most universities and colleges are not conducting any research and that there is a lack of funding in various disciplines with transparency, competitive reviews for research
 adhure anusandhan prastaavon ke liye pratispardhi dhan dene ko ek rashtriya anusandhan foundation (enaref) kii sthapana kii jaaegi

 Sengupta says, "the serious problem is that the country is grappling with the problem of inappropriateness of graduates for employment and the lack of proper reciprocal relationship between education and skills

 Former Union Human Resource Minister M

 Pallam Raju also said that there is nothing special in the NEP to strengthen the academic industry and no special recommendations have been made in relation to exchange between faculty and industry
 ve kehete hai, ''iske alaava, itii or politechnic kisi bhi audyogic raashtra kii ridh hai or inhen majboot karne kii siforishein bhi isamen nahin hai
 However, others find that NEP actually facilitates the expansion of the business of vocational education by bringing all streams under the same regulator — the National Higher Education Regulatory Authority or NHERA

 Students will be introduced to practical training from class 5 itself
 rajput kehete hai, ''haath ke hunar or madhyamik str par vyavsaayik kaushal praapt karne main ruchi paidaa karne ke pehle ke prayaas safal nahin hue
 This is a major deficiency in our school education
 vartmaan prastaav vyavsaayik or shaikshanik dhaaraon ke bich koi algaav nahin karata or yah ek nayaa tathaa saahasik kadam he

 The NEP proposes to set up the National Education Commission (RSA), which academics have been demanding for a long time, to monitor 'accessible but agile' control education at the national level
 aresae satat or sthai aadhaar par desh ke shiksha drushtikon ko lagu karegaa
 The Prime Minister will be the head of the RSA and the Minister of Human Resource Development will be its Deputy Chief

 "it all points towards more centralized control of education," says Menon

 "bhatti says," NEP has suggested so many new structures parallel to the existing system
 aisa lagata he ki samiti ne ateet ke aise prayogon se koi sabak nahin liya he
 "the NEP has shown its ambiguity towards regulating private sector education that private educational enterprises will be motivated by non-profit objectives, it shows their ignorance of this sector
" haalanki, saarvajanik or nijee skulon donon ke viniman kaa ek hi maandand or benchmark tay karne ke eneepi ke prastaav kaa swaagat bhi hua he
 "we can debate the details of the policy," says Dhawan, but this step is a step in the right direction, especially around 40 percent of children studying in private schools
 ''kya desh ise saakaar kar saktaa he?adhikansh shikshavidon kaa maananaa he ki eneepi ne bhartiya shiksha pranali ko prabhavit karne vaali bimariyon kaa nidaan kiya he or vishesh rup se schuli shiksha main upachaaratmak upayon kii peshkash kii he lekin asli chunauti to ise dharaatal par utaarne kii hogi
 The country has a rich history of policy objectives, but hardly any changes have taken place on the ground
 menon kehete hai, ''karyanvayan main sabase kathin chunauti aparyaapt or kharaab buniyadi sanrachana hogi
 Apart from capacity building at present, it will require the most investment of time and resources in obtaining close support of district and block level officers and teachers working on the ground, as well as their close monitoring
 ''eneepi in chunautiyon se waakif he or yah sweekaar karti he ki ''saavdhaneepurvak yojana banane or jamini vaastaviktaaon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue behatar kriyanvayan kii ranneeti, vyaavhaarikta'' par isaki safalataa nirbhar karegi
 It recognizes corruption as 'the key factor that distorts the education system', but does not provide any concrete mechanism to deal with it
 raju in siforeeshon par sarkaar kii ore se fori karrwai chaahate hai
 But, Banerjee says, it can be easy to say no, because implementing this policy will require coordinated collaboration between governments, stakeholders involved and the public at various levels
 banerjee kahati hai, ''foundation stage ke uddeshyon ko safaltaapurvak lagu karne ke liye, mahila or bal vikaas (jo anganwadiawon ke liye jimmedaar he) or maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantralayon ke bich samanvay kii aavashyaktaa hogi

 ''iske alaava, shiksha par saarvajanik vyay ne 1968 kii niti main pehali baar pariklpit jidipi ke 6 pratishat ke lakshya ko kabhi praapt nahin kiya he

 Overall, the separation of spending on education from GDP will only harm the fund

 "given the financial constraints, the Center will need to prioritize among these broad policy recommendations," he says
 ''eneepi report ke masaude ko abhi samiksha ke kam se kam do daur se guzarana hoga

 donon yahaan afghanistan par ho rahe conference main hissaa lene pahunche hai
 The conference is of two days on October 4 and 5
 bharat or pakistan donon taraf se yah saaf kar diya gaya he ki donon ke bich koi aapasi mulaakaat kaa kaarykram tay nahin he, haalanki jab donon ek shahar main hai to najar is baat par hogi ki donon aupchaarik taur par na sahi, lekin kya anaupchaarik taur par hi sahi, aapas main milenge
 The expectation is further heightened when both will be present within a hall during the conference
 uri or sargical strike ke baad yah pehla mauqaa he jab deshon ke mantri str ke rajaneta ek conference main maujuud honge
 Such an expectation is being expressed that in the last 48 hours, there have been two news reports between the national security personnel of both countries
 yah bhi kaha gaya ki is baatcheet main donon enese elosi par tanaav ghataane ko sahamat ho gaye haalanki yah khabar pakistan kii media ke hawaale se ai, lekin bhartiya videsh mantralay yaa enese ke daftar kii taraf se isaki aadhikarik pushti nahin kii gai, na hi is khabar se inkaar kiya gaya
 The comments ek tathy yah bhi he ki akbar or ajij brussels ke kisi gupachup daure par nahin hai balki afghanistan conference main hissaa lene ke liye ghoshit daure par hai isliye yah maamla donon deshon ke enese kii us gupachup mulaaqaat se bilkul alag he, jo unhone baatcheet ko patari par laane ke liye bangkok main kii thi
 Then it is also seen that Prime Minister Modi and Nawaz Sharif, who arrived in New York to attend the United Nations General Assembly last year, did not meet each other while staying in the same hotel in the Waldorf Istoria
 aupchaarik to dur anaupchaarik taur par bhi nahin
 Similarly, Sushma Swaraj and Sartaz Aziz did not meet despite being face to face in New York
 uri hamale or phir bharat kii sargical strike ke baad donon deshon ke bich jis tarah kaa tanaav he, aise main duniya ke kai deshon kaa jor is baat par he ki donon desh maamle ko thanda karen
 This may be an occasion when there is scope for some talk between the two countries
 ummid or bad jaati he jab donon conference ke dauraan ek haul ke bheetar maujuud honge
 This is the first time since Uri and the surgical strike when ministerial level politicians from countries will be present at a conference
 aisi ummid isliye jataai ja rahi he ki pichley 48 ghanton main donon deshon ke rashtriya surakshakaron ke bich do baar baatcheet khabar ai he
 It was also said that in this conversation both the NSA agreed to reduce the tension on the loc
 Although the news came from the Pakistani media, it was not officially confirmed by the Indian Foreign Ministry or NSA office, nor was it The news was denied
 tippaniyan There is also a fact that Akbar and Aziz are not on a clandestine visit to Brussels, but are on a declared visit to attend the Afghanistan conference, so the matter is very different from the nsa's secret meeting of the two countries which they have negotiated
 i had to bring it to Bangkok
 phir yah bhi dekha gaya he ki pichley saal sanyukt raashtra mahadhiveshan main hissaa lene neuyork pahunche pradhanmantri modi or nawaz shareef ek hi hotel main waldorph estoria main rahete hue bhi aapas main nahin mili
 Not formal but also informally
 isi tarah sushamaa swaraj or sarataaj azeej neuyork main hi aamane-saamne hone ke baavjood nahin mili
 After the Uri attack and then the surgical strike of India, the tension between the two countries, in such a situation, the emphasis of many countries of the world is that both countries cool the case
 yah ek mauqaa ho saktaa he jab donon deshon ke bich kuch baat kii gunjaaish bane
 Such an expectation is being expressed that in the last 48 hours, there have been two news reports between the national security personnel of both countries
 yah bhi kaha gaya ki is baatcheet main donon enese elosi par tanaav ghataane ko sahamat ho gaye haalanki yah khabar pakistan kii media ke hawaale se ai, lekin bhartiya videsh mantralay yaa enese ke daftar kii taraf se isaki aadhikarik pushti nahin kii gai, na hi is khabar se inkaar kiya gaya

 Just before pack-up a member of our # bucketlist unit played "lo chali main" As soon as we heard the music Madhuri and i got up instinctively and danced on the song
 The initiative of course was Madhuri's, her enthusiasm is so loveable and childlike and she's really ageing backwards i tell you And so we danced with abandon, all the people watching us and recording us were just a blur as we felt that warm and fuzzy feeling of working together in # HAHK 24 years ago, of creating beautiful memories not only in # HAHK but also in the present with # bucketlist
 Enjoy the video and don't forget to see the inimitable magic of Madhuri in our film # bucketlist releasing on the 25th of May
 Enjoyyy our # HAHK throwback video

 Leader of Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad said that this is a bill which will affect the lives of many people in a positive or negative way, so it should be discussed in detail by sending the bill to the Joint Select Committee
 unhone kaha ki is sambandh main vipaksh kii ore se prastaav bhi laayaa gaya he
 Azad accused the government of ignoring parliamentary traditions and wanted to pass most of the bills directly in Parliament without sending them to the Standing or Select Committee
 unhone kaha ki teen talaak vidheyak ko loksabhaa main standing cameti ke paas nahin bheja gaya
 Ghulam Nabi Azad said that this is a very important bill related to Muslim women and it is necessary to discuss it by sending it to the Select Committee
 is par sansadeey kaary rajyamantri vijay goyal ne kaha ki yah muslim mahilaon ke adhikaron se judaa ati mahatvapurn vidheyak he tathaa vipaksh is vidheyak ko jaan boojhkar atkana chahta he

 in donon kitabon main se skool apane chaatro ko koi ek hi kitaab refer karte hai
 Now according to these parents, in the CBSE English core paper held on March 2, the questions of both books were given without any choice, which stunned the children
 As per CBSE there are two novels in 12th board
 Both que 11 & 12 needs to have 2 questions from each novel
 But 11th question comprised of only Silas Marner
 Students having Invisible Man couldn't write it

 Now the parents of these children are demanding that CBSE should be given 6 numbers due to this question coming out of the syllabus
 vahiin, NDTV se baat karte hue CBSE ke adhikari kaa kahana he ki yah ek 'anjaani chook' he or isse kisi bhi bachche ke nabanron par asar nahin hoga
 Because CBSE has its own mechanism to deal with such lapses, which does not affect the final marks of the children
 vahiin, ab CBSE kaa kahana he ki yah khabar bhraamak tareeke se chalaai ja rahi he

 yahaan par endie ko haraane karne ke liye bihar main banaae gaye 'mahagathbandhan' kii tarj par iske ek hisse ke rup main chunaav ladane kii yojana he
 He said that the party wants three symbols - tree, plow farmer and hut one
 bargad kaa ped sanyukt socialist party, jabaki jhopadi praja socialist party kaa chunaav chihn tha
 The mark of the plow farmer was that of the Lok Dal
 ye sabhi kisi na kisi samay main ek bade janata parivaar kaa hissaa rahe hai
 The comments puraani party janata dal kaa chunaav chinh 'chakra' paane ke prati utsukata vyakt karne ke baad jediu ne janata dal (secular) ke samarthan kii sambhaavna nahin hone ke kaaran isaki ummid chhod di he
 Immediately after the Bihar elections, a JDU delegation met the Bihar Election Commission to discuss the election symbol
 'chakra' chihn ke unki maang par pratikriya vyakt karte hue ayog ne unase kaha tha ki yah chihn unhen tabhi diya ja saktaa he, jab janata dal (secular) ko is par aapatti nahin ho
 Party sources said that after the Makar Sankranti, a delegation of the party would meet the Election Commission on the issue
 jediu ko ummid he ki is maheene ke ant tak use nayaa chihn mil jayega
 The banyan tree was the election symbol of the United Socialist Party, while the hut Praja Socialist Party
 hal chalaane vaale kisaan kaa chihn lokdal kaa tha
 All of them have been part of a large Janata family at some time
 tippaniyan After expressing its eagerness to get the old party Janata Dal's election symbol 'chakra', the JDU has given up hope for the possibility of Janta Dal (secular) support
 bihar chunaav ke tatkaal baad jediu ke ek pratinidhimandal ne chunaav chihn par charchaa karne ke liye bihar chunaav ayog se mulaakaat kii thi
 Reacting to their demand for the 'chakra' sign, the Commission had told them that this mark can be given only if the Janata Dal (secular) does not object to it
 party ke sutron ne bataaya ki makar sankranti ke baad party kaa ek pratinidhimandal is mudde ko lekar chunaav ayog se mulaakaat karegaa
 JDU hopes to get a new mark by the end of this month

 The father of Mohammad Amir Mohammad Khan, a former MLA from Mahmudabad, had moved to Pakistan in 1957 but decided to stay in India
 kya aisa kar ke ve “desh” ke shatru ho gaye? kya bhartiya cricket team ke purv captain marhoom mansoor ali khan pataudi, unki patni sharmila tagore or unke bachche saf, soha or sabaa ko bharat kaa “shatru” samajha jaae? sunne main ajeeb lag saktaa he, lekin endie sarkaar kaa pesh kiya gaya ek nayaa vidheyak yadi kanoon kii shakl le letaa he, to ye sawaal aane vaale samay main beshak uthenge
 That too at a time when the country is embroiled in a fierce debate on nationalism, treason and the rights given to minorities in secular India
 vibhaajan ke kareeb 70 saal or pakistan ke saath jang ko 50 saal se bhi zyada vakt biit jane ke baad sarkaar us kanoon ko dobaaraa lagu karne kii koshish main he jo ek saath do jwalanth masalon se nipatane kii manshaa rakhata he&“shatru” or “sampatti”
 In this direction, an ordinance was introduced on 7 January which was converted into the Enemy Property (amendment and Validation) Bill 2016 and passed by the Lok Sabha on 9 March, despite that Congress, BJD, TMC, TRS, AIMIM And the RSP leaders had lodged a protest against it
 iskaa lakshya us sampatti ko rajasat karnaa he jo kabhi pakistani naagarik kii thi, bhale hi ukt vyakti ke kanoonee uttaradhikari bhartiya hai
 The Bill amends the original Enemy Property Bill, 1968 from the previous date and also rejects the Supreme Court's decision in 2005 stating that the rights of Indian citizens should not be violated in the process of governing such properties
 
 15 march ko rajyasabha ne yah vidheyak samiksha ke liye pravar samiti ke paas bhejne kii maang kii he
 Some experts believe that this bill is against the constitutional right to equality as it distinguishes between two types of Indians & one whose ancestors went to Pakistan and the other who did not
 congress saansad shashi tharur ne loksabhaa main kaha tha, “yah lakhon bhartiya nagarikon ke adhikaron par asar daalega
 Simply put, it will directly affect the Muslim community
 yah unki sampatti he jo pakistan chale gaye the or yah ek hi samudaay kaa maamla he or mere hisaab se yah na keval asanvaidhanik he&yah adaalat ko tay karnaa chahie&balki prakritik nyaay ke siddhant ke bhi khilaaf he
 “the UPA government had prepared one such bill in 2010 but its leaders, especially Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, allowed the bill to die in the wake of the controversy
 pichhali gananaa ke hisaab se sarkaar ne 19 rajyon main 15,143 “shatru sampattiyaan” pahachaani hai jinamein mahal, haweliyaan, makaan samet vanijyik imaaraten or kheti kii jaminen shaamil hai
 The number of such properties in 2011 was barely 2,111 which increased dramatically
 inamen se ek lakh karod ru
 The process of coronating 9,400 properties with an estimated cost of Rs
 1,00,000 and handing over the custody of enemy assets to custodians in India has already been completed
 vidheyak 1968 se hi “shatru sampatti” kii uske uttaradhikari dwaara bikri yaa hastantaran ko khaarij karata he
 There are many of these people who do not even know that the property they had was once an "enemy"
 nae praavdhaanon ke anusaar in sampattiyon ko bharat sarkaar apane kabje main lekar kisi tisare ko bech sakati he or use rokane kaa koi kanoonee rasta maujuud nahin he
 The government argues that it is having difficulty in handling the process of maintenance and litigation etc
 of these properties
 sarkaar kahati he ki chunki in sampattiyon kaa koi istemaal nahin ho rahaa, to vah inhen bechakar aae paise ko consolidated fund of india main sthanantarit kar sakati he chunki pakistan pehle hi apane yahaan maujuud bhartiya nagarikon kii sampattiyon ko bech chukaa he
 Pakistan completed this process only in 1971, although the move of India is being dubbed against the idea of india and the bill is being called "retaliatory action"
 “shatru sampatti” se jude maamalon ke jaankaar or supreme court ke adhivaktaa niraj gupta kehete hai, “duusare desh main jo hua uskaa hamaare liye koi matlab nahin hona chahie
 We have our own laws
 jin logon ke purakhe pakistan chale gaye lekin unhone bharat main hi ruknaa sweekaar kiya, kya iskaa koi arth nahin he? “shatru” ko dandit karne kii bajaae aap apano ko hi to sajaa nahin de rahe?” duusare shabdon main agar palaayan ko aparaadh maan liya jaae, tab bhi pita ke paapon ke liye aap beton ko sajaa kaise de sakate hai?kya chunaav kii ahmiyat he?is masale ko behatar tareeke se samajhane ke liye ham uttar pradesh main lakhanu, sitapur or nainital main maujuud mahamudabad kii sampattiyon kii misaal le sakate hai
 In December 1957, the then King of Mahmudabad, Mohammad Aamir Ahmad Khan took citizenship of Pakistan
 unki patni rani kanij aabid or bete mohammad aamir mohammad khan ne vahaan na jane kaa faisla kiya
 This was five years before the concept of "enemy property" was introduced during the Chinese war in 1962, when Chinese citizens' assets in India were temporarily handed over to a custodian to ensure that their Use will not be against the state
 jab 1965 kii jang chhidi, to teen saal puraane aadesh ke praavdhaanon ko pakistan tak vistaarit kar diya gaya or natijatan mahamudabad kii sampatti ko centre sarkaar ne apane kabje main le liya
 Raja died in London in 1973
 unke bete tab cambridge main astrophysics kii padhai kar rahe the
 He returned to India and petitioned that the government return his father's property as he is his father's legal heir and an Indian citizen
 congress se 1985 or 1989 main do baar vidhayak rah chuke mohammad aamir mohammad khan agle 24 saal tak sarkaar se apni sampatti chhodie kii guhaar lagaate rahe lekin koi hal nahin niklaa
 He finally filed a writ petition in the Bombay High Court in 1997 as the office of the custodian of enemy properties is in Mumbai
 2001 main ve mukadmaa jeet gaye, jiske baad endie sarkaar ne hycourt ke aadesh ko supreme court main chunauti di, lekin aamir ne 2005 main phir se mukadmaa jeet liya
 The Supreme Court in its order said that the central government had been illegally occupying their property since 1973
 in sampattiyon main sabase mahatvapurn hai lakhanu ke bahari ilaake main sthit mahamudabad kaa kila, lakhanu kaa butler pales, sitapur main jiladhikari or police adheekshak kaa awaas or nainital kaa hotel metropol&inhen unako de diya gaya
 Some of the other properties of Hazratganj in Lucknow were left symbolically, although Aamir could not get possession of them due to some disputes related to tenancy
 yah sari vyavastha haalanki 2010 main achaanak gadabada gai jab upie sarkaar ne ek adhyadesh laakar 1968 ke mul shatru sampatti kanoon ko pichhali taarikh se dobaaraa likhane kii koshish kii
 The Custodian's agents once again took possession of Mahmudabad's property and did not return the property to the family even after the ordinance was pending
 aamir ek baar phir adaalat pahunche
 First the Delhi High Court and then the Uttarakhand High Court, after which the case was referred to the Supreme Court
 is maamle main 7 janvari, 2016 ko sunwaayee honi thi lekin ain usee din endie sarkaar ne kanoon ko pichhali taarikh se sanshodhit tathaa maanya karaane ke liye ek adhyadesh jari kar diya
 Says 72-year-old Mohammad Aamir Mohammad Khan, "I do not bother that my property is at stake, but the broader message that is going on from this case is worrying
" kya main isliye yah sab jhel rahaa hum kyonki main aise shaks kaa betaa hum jisane ek maukey par pakistan kaa samarthan kiya tha lekin baad main puri tarah badal gaya? kya main isliye abhishpt hum kyonki main musalmaan hum yaa ki main ek saamanti parivaar main paidaa hua?” ve kehete hai, “beshak main apane janm se vah sab kuch hum, lekin maine bhartiya naagarik hona chunaa he isliye kisi bhi duusare bhartiya kii tarah samvidhan or kanoon kii nigaah main baraabar hum
 The new bill will affect millions of Indians, open the way to corruption and keep mocking all judicial institutions including the Supreme Court
 ”mahamudabad kii jaaydaad to sirf ek misaal he
 The government's intention was clear a year before the promulgation of this ordinance when, on 19 December 2014, the Custodian issued notice to Saif Ali Khan under Section 11 of the 1968 Act asking that he inherit the property of Bhopal Estate Why not be considered "enemy property"? Then in February 2015 the Custodian also declared it "enemy property", on the grounds that Abida Sultan, the eldest daughter of the then Nawab of Bhopal Hamidullah Khan & mother of eminent diplomat and cricket administrator Shaharyar Khan, had moved to Pakistan in 1950
 aisa iske baavjood ki aabida sultan ne apni viraasat or jaaydaad se khud ko alag kar liya tha jo unki bahan sajidah sultan ko uttaradhikaar main mili
 She was the mother and only heir of Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi
 is viraasat ke hastantaran ko 1961 main bharat ke raashtrapati se aadhikarik manyata praapt thi
 Saif has stayed the court against the possession of Bhopal property by the custodian
 saf ke vakil rajesh pancholi kehete hai, “nae bill ke baavjood sampatti ko shatru sampatti qaraar nahin diya ja saktaa
 When the President of India has stamped on the inheritance given to Sajida Sultan, how can the Custodian issue a notice or order violating it? ” There is another group of 5,000 families in Bhopal which may be affected by this bill
 is samooh ne ghar bachaao sangharsh samiti gathit kii he or inke vakil jagadish chhavnee hai, jinka kahana he ki is maamle main 10,000 acre se zyada jameen shaamil he
 Some of his clients have bought property over the last five decades that has been threatened because the new bill rejects all previous purchases of "enemy property"
 ise is tarah se samajhen ki aapane agar bechney vaale ke swaamitv kaa pareekshan karne ke baad sampatti kharidi ho or tamaam kharid-farokht ke silsile ko jaanchane ke baad aap is nishkarsh par pahunche hon ki ise “shatru sampatti” maane jane kii koi vajah nahin he, tab bhi agar kisi mode par yah sampatti kisi aise shaks ke paas rahi ho jo pakistani tha yaa ho gaya, to aapse vah sampatti chhini ja sakati he
 BJD MP Pinaki Mishra had raised a question in the Lok Sabha, "there must have been horse trading hundreds of times in fifty years
" aap in sabko khaarij bhi kar denge or kisi ke liye koi kanoonee rasta bhi nahin chodenge? kya yah sansad aisa vahiyaat kanoon bana sakati he? yah to anuchhed 226 ke tahat turant ek yachika daayar kiye jane kaa nyotaa he or pehle hi din is par roak lag jaaegi!”kuch duusari ahm jaaydaadon main gautamabuddha nagar ke shahberi gaanv kii ek jameen he jise 1968 main bechaa gaya tha lekin ab use castodian ne le liya he
 One property is in Hyderabad's Rangareddy district, which is occupied by the Custodian, despite only one of its four owners having gone to Pakistan
 sthaayee shatru?vidheyak ko sansad main rakhe jate vakt kendriya grih mantri rajnath singh ne in aaropon ko halakaa karne kii koshish kii ki yah vidheyak alpsankhyak virdohi he or kaha ki bill chini nagarikon kii sampatti par bhi lagu hoga
 The question is, is there any such thing as a permanent enemy? Today, within the political structure of the nation-state, there are partners and rivals, alliances and estrangements, but their definitions change over time
 britain or germany jang ke dauraan dushman rahe lekin aaj morchon par saajheedaar hai
 Even though India and Pakistan were born as twin republics in 1947 and have perpetuated terrorism on the border since then, our relationship is not very different
 hamaare pradhanmantri vyapaar, khel or prashasnic bahaali ke liye samvaad karte hai
 The permanent nature of this bill, however, assumes that two countries were and will remain our enemies
 agar bharat kisi tisare desh ke saath jang main ulajh jaae yaa phir aisi paristhiti main pad jaae jahaan use kisi or desh ko apana dushman maananaa pade, tab kya us desh ke logon kii sampattiyaan bhi jabt kii jaaengi?sattadhari bijepi ne loksabhaa main ek kadam or aage badha diya jab rajasthan se uske saansad pi
 P
 choudhary ne kaha ki vidheyak main rajdroh ke maamle ke doshi logon kii sampattiyon ko bhi joda janaa chahie
 He said, "A person convicted of treason should also be considered an" enemy "and his property should be brought within the purview of the provisions of this bill
 ”to shatru sampatti vidheyak is sarkaar ke haathon kaa ek aisa aujaar hoga jiske sahare vah kisi bhi vyakti ke khilaaf karrwai kar sakegi jise vah rajdroh main lipt maanati he? sarkaar ko in sawaalon kaa jawaab dena hoga, sansad main yaa adaalat main
 Who is the enemy, who is not, this is just a glimpse of the days to come

 In this case, an FIR has been lodged at Gandhi Maidan police station in Patna
 kaamanwealth ke udghaatan samaaroh main baba ramdev ne shaamil hone se saaf inkaar kar diya he
 The reason is the allegations of corruption against the organization of the Commonwealth
 kaamanwealth khelon kii taiyaariyon main ghotaalon kii jhadi lagane se baba ramdev behad khafa hai
 Baba has repeatedly targeted the Organizing Committee of the Commonwealth Games, but now he has directly expressed his anger

 Baba Ramdev was called as a guest at this event
 ramdev kaa kahana he ki khelon ke aayojan main faile bhrashtachar ke chalate unhone ye faisla kiya he
 He said, "it is against my honor to attend this event after the news of corruption in the Games
" '' baba ne khelon ke uddhatan samaaroh main patanjali yogapith kii team ko yoga kaarykram pesh karne se nahin roka he, lekin khud is aayojan se duuri bana lee he
 Along with the happiness of Diwali, it also brings a lot of calories and fat

 Pawar said, `` While taking the decision regarding cricket, the apex court had said that the officials should not be more than 70 years of age and had termed these posts as 'posts of profit' which made me sad and hence now i do not wish to continue in this position any more

 ' associated chambers of commers and industry of india (asocham) ke adhyaksh rana kapur ne kaha, 'krishi, khanan, vinirmaan, bijli, gas, jalaapurti or anya utility sevaayen chintaa ke pramukh kaaran bane hue hai, haalanki vyapaar, hotel or sanchaar tathaa nirmaan sectoron main kuch pragati dikhaai di he

 Another big issue is the MOP ie Memorandum of Procedures (mop)
 masalaa ucch nyaayalayon main jajon or chif justise kii niyukti or supreme court main jajon kii niyukti ko lekar collegium system main zyada paardarshita auki javaabadari laane ko lekar bhi he
 After the demolition of the Government-appointed NJAC ie National Judicial Appointments Commission, the emphasis was on making the collegium system more transparent

 It also talked about bringing more transparency in the process of designating senior judges
 chif justise ko ye nahin suhaya
 He transferred the order of the court of Justice Adarsh goyal and Justice UU Lalit to his court and overturned his order
 baat sirf yahi nahin he
 Another petitioner says that in the case of serious allegations of corruption in universities, Justice Chelameswar said many times during the hearing of his case that the allegations of the petitioner have merit, because the vice-chancellors of many central universities are coming under this purview
 Were those who committed economic and moral corruption

 Actually, in the matter of appointment of judges, both the parties i
e
 the government and the Supreme Court want that these rights should remain with them

 That is, on all the points where the constitution and the Supreme Court rules are silent, the government and the judiciary can together make universal rules with transparency and accountability
 kaha to yahaan tak ja rahaa he ki abhi to supreme court or sarkaar donon kii hi manshaa he ki jajon kii niyukti kaa adhikaar unako hi mili, lekin isamen dilchaspee kisi kii nahin ki aakhir kaise logon ko jaj banaaya jaae
 Nobody is concerned about whether the people being made judges are eligible for this position or not

 5 over main chah wicket par 142 ran banaaye the
 India had to bear the brunt of losing the wicket right from the start
 keval kohli hi puure vishwaas ke saath ballebaaji kar paye
 He played 92 balls in his innings and hit seven fours and two sixes
 yuvaraj (12) ne johaan botha par long aan par chakka jadkar apane tevar dikhaaye lekin isi over main vah pedal sweep karne ke prayaas main greem smith ko kaich dekar pavilion laute
 Kohli showed the best batting conditions under such pressure and together with Suresh Raina took the innings with one run

 He specifically targeted spinner Pietersen and hit the first six of his innings
 raina haalanki isi over main stump out ho gayi or is tarah se unke or kohli ke bich kii saajhedaari 63 ran par tut gayi
 Raina came out to play Peterson's straight ball but he missed and AB de Villiers did not take any time to play his role behind the wicket
 sanyog dekhiye ki kohli ne petersan ke agle over main bhi long aaf par chakka jadaa or baayen haath ke is spinner ne duusare chor ke ballebaaj mahendra singh dhoni (2) ko out karke jashn manaaya
 The Indian captain gave easy catch to Fall to Plessis on the extra cover

 Batting first after South Africa won the toss, Hashim Amla (64) lost five wickets for 118 runs in the middle due to the superb bowling of Yuvraj Singh (three wickets for 34 runs) and a run-in strike
 jepi dumini (naabad 71) ne iske baad johaan botha (44) ke saath 70 or robin petersan (31) ke saath 54 ran kii saajhedaari karke team ko saat wicket par 265 ran ke majboot score tak pahunchaaya
 Amla became the batsman to complete 2000 runs in the shortest innings in one-day international cricket, but the match map changed completely after Yuvraj's attack
 dakshin africa ne lagaataar chaar over main chaar wicket ganvaaye jisamen se do wicket yuvaraj ke khate main gayi jabaki do ballebaaj ran out hue
 In his third over, Yuvraj had Morne Van Wyk (15) caught by Kohli in the slip, while in the next over, Amla was run out for the greed of stealing the second run
 abi divilliars (3) bhi adhik der tak nahin tik paye or yuvaraj ke agle shikaar bane
 South Africa scores 118 for five after Faf du Plessis (1) was run out
 aise mode par botha or dumini ne sanbhalkar ballebaaji karke team ko sankat se ubaara
 Dhoni made frequent bowling changes and used a total of eight bowlers
 yuvaraj ne apane naye spel ke shuru main hi botha ko stump out karwaakar apana teesraa wicket liya, lekin petersan ne dumini ko unki kami nahin khalane di
 Duminy remained at the crease till the end

 Suddenly, two self-styled brand ambassadors of the country's anti-corruption fight have come on the defensive
 pitashanthibhushanor putr prashanth bhushan ne sarkaron, korporate gharaanon or bhrasht raajnneetikon ke khilaaf aam janata kii ore se ladi ja rahi ladaai main mujahidon kii apni chhavi gadhane main samoochaa jivan arpit kar diya he
 Recently, both of these names reached the top during Anna Hazare's movement in favor of appointing a symbol of honesty as Lokpal to curb the magic of politics and to wipe out the dirt of politics by turning his magic wand
 lekin jab ek aisi sidi saamne ai, jisamen shanti bhushan or raajnneetik amar singh tathaa mulaayam singh kii baatcheet record thi, to unki pratishtha par aanch aane lagi
 This CD had a demolition line
 kathith rup se shanti bhushan kii ek aawaaj kahati haih ''prashanth bahut acha manage karte hai
 
 
 It does not require a lot of money
 chaar karod rupaya bahut he
 After this, Bhushan Pitaputra immediately came in counter-attack posture
 unka daawa tha ki yah sidi bhrashtachar ke khilaaf unke jehad kii saakh ko batta lagane ke liye jodtodakar banaai gai he
 Prashant announced at a press conference that his father had never met Amar Singh, as claimed in the CD
 teen din baad amar singh ne bhi ek press conference kii or yah daawa kiya ki ve 28 farvari, 2006 ko dalbadal virodh ke ek maamle main samaajawaadee party kii vakaalat karne ke liye pita bhushan ko chartered vimaan se lakhanu laae the
 He said, "I was part of the lawyer-lawyer meeting during the discussion on that case

 But when he said that he would pay 25 lakhs per muscle

 The Delhi Police has sent the CD to the Central Criminology Laboratory for examination
 pataa chalaa he ki shuruaati sarkari report main use asli sidi bataaya gaya he
 a copy of it will be sent to the Government Laboratory of Chandigarh for re-examination
 bhushan pitaputra pehle hi do nijee aparaadh vigyaan prayogshaalaon ke praaanpatr pesh kar chuke hai, jinamein daawa kiya gaya he ki sidi main herpher kiya gaya he
 Amar Singh, who never gave up in battle, has sent this CD to seven laboratories around the world
 lekin bhushan pitaputra banaam amar singh to is tamaashe kaa maatr ek manoranjak paksh he
 The real matter is whether the hands of the most well-known brand names in the anti-corruption campaign are also stuck in the same gargoyle against which they are fighting
 is sidi kaa maamla us samay prishthbhumi main chalaa gaya jab ye khabaren saamne ain ki bhushan pitaputra neuttar pradesh sarkaar ko chuunaa lagaaya tha
 It was alleged that on a plot of 7,818 square meters in Allahabad, which Bhushan Pitaputra paid Rs 1 lakh last year
 main kharida tha, unhone stamp duty bachaa lee thi
 Two months ago, the Uttar Pradesh government sent a notice to him asking for the amount of stamp duty paid
 pitaputra ne 6,66,000 ru
 The stamp duty was given
 lekin tab chal rahe sarkal rate ke mutabik, yah stamp duty 1
 33 crores Rs
 baithti he
 For those who believe him, Prashant claimed that along with the stamp duty, which he had calculated on the basis of the lessee's property under the Rent Control Act, he also said that he would pay the dues
 congress ke mahasachiv digvijay singh kii tarah jin logon ne unki is baat par andeh prakat kiya, unhen manahani kaa notice bhej diya gaya
 a copy of this was also sent to Sonia Gandhi
 iske baad noida kaa jameen prakaran saamne aayaa
 In January 2009, the Noida Authority had allotted two plots of 10,00010,000 square meters of cultivated land in Noida to Shanti Bhushan and his son Jayant under the "khuli Scheme for Development of Farmhouses on Agricultural Land"
 jayant, jo peshey se vakil hi hai, noida pratimaa cond main mayawati ke khilaaf pesh ho chuke hai
 Both the fathers had applied under this scheme

 Had to repay, the rest was to be paid in 16 installments
 vidambnaa he ki aisi yojanaon kii paardarshita par sawaal uthaae jane ke baavjood shanti bhushan kehete hai ki yah chunauti khud unki ore se nahin, balki ''un vyaktiyon kii ore se di jaani chahie jinhen yojana ke tahat plot nahin mila he
 "politicians have taken this kind of subjective morality in the face
" samaajawaadee party ke mohan singh sawaal uthaate hai, ''agar ve jaanate the ki in aavantnon main rishwat di gai thi to unhone ise sweekaar hi kyon kiya tha?'' prashanth ne us andolan kii aguai kii thi,jisamen jajon se apni sampatti kii ghoshnaa karne ke maang kii gai thi, lekin ab khud unki apni sampatti kii ghoshnaa hi unke liye ulti pad gai he
 Apart from the Bofors and Narmada dam cases, interestingly, there is a list of issues of public interest on which Prashant has fought
 kuch logon ko yaad hoga ki unki daayar janhit yachika ke aadhaar par hi dramuk ke purv swasthya mantri dow

 The campaign was reinforced against Venugopal and he issued a show cause notice to the doctor

 The elated Amar Singh says, "gandhiji gave us three monkeys
 anna hajaare ne hamen do die hai
 Last month, Prashant argued against the media's ban on Amar Singh tapes
 lekin ab civil sosayadi main bhi sawaal uthaae jane lage hai
 Supreme Court lawyer Rajeevadhavan says, "bhushan Pitaputra should think very carefully and decide whether Lokpal bill is more important or his own reputation or both these things are related to each other?" Certainly, the unfolding of income against assets has created some sense of mistrust among the people and this helm of public interest petitions is no bigger than the movement of which it is a part

 If we want any criterion for politicians then we must adopt the same criteria
 ''bhushan pitaputra kaa paala vivaad se tabhi pad gaya tha jab lokapal samiti main unke naamon kii ghoshnaa kii gai thi
 The first ballot was launched by yoga guru Baba Ramdev, who called the inclusion of both father and son as familism
 samiti main maujuud ek sutara ke mutabik, shanti bhushan ne yah kahkar unhen jawaab diya tha ki ''usamen yoga guruon kii nahin, kanoon ke jaankaron kii jarurat he
 "but controversy is nothing new for Bhushan Pitaputra
 maanavadhikaar ke pakshpaati hone ke kaaran unhen dodhari talwaar par chalanaa padataa he
 If Prashant defended his right of expression in case of sedition charges against writer Arundhati Roy, Shanti Bhushan wrote a letter to the President against Afzal Guru's death sentence claiming that he was not the main accused but merely involved in the conspiracy Was
 prashanth adaalat kii avmaananaa kaa maamla bhi jhel rahe hai, kyonki unhone kaha tha ki desh ke pichley 16 mukhya nyaayadhishon main se aadhe bhrasht the

 Shanti Bhushan had earlier appeared on behalf of the petitioner, but when Shukla reached the Allahabad High Court on 23 May 2006, he had told the lawyer not to appear on his behalf
 shukla ke mutabik, iske baavjood bhushan vahaan nijee vimaan se aae or unhen nahin pataa ki is yatra kaa kharch kisne diya
 Amar Singh says, "this is a wonderful case where he wanted to assist the court, although the petitioners did not want to have him as a lawyer

" lekin is vidheyak ko sansadeey prakriya ke jariye gambhirtha se aakaar dena hoga
 The ruling establishment would like to handle this public opinion carelessly

 It cannot be countered by leaving politics and adopting a shortcut

 Anna Hazare wrote a letter to Sonia Gandhi complaining about the attempt to discredit the movement
 congress adhyaksh ne unhen jawaab diya ki ve aisi raajnneeti kaa samarthan nahin karatin
 Social workers feel that Bhushan Pitaputra is only the first target

 In support of Anna Hazare, the people of the country, Anna, came on the road and stressed that our fast will continue till the Jan Lokpal bill passes

 It is important to note that several blood tests are done before the blood donor is offered to any patient
 inamen echivi or hepatitis jaisi jaanchen elaija dwaara kii jaati hai
 In such a case, if the transfusion of blood donor is new, then it could not come out in this test
 iske liye NAT (neucleic acid test) kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, jisaki suvidha bahut hi kam aspataalon main he

 bijepi netaaon par narendra modi kaa jaadu kis had tak sir par chadh gaya he iskaa ek udhaaharan party ke hi ek kaarykram main tab dekhne ko mila jab gujarat ke cabinet mantri ne apane bhaashan main narendra modi ko desh kii aazaadee ke baad piem pad par congressiyon kii pehali pasand bataa daalaa
 Significantly, Narendra Modi was born in 1950, three years after the independence of the country and Prime Minister Modi himself has said many times in his speech that he is the first Prime Minister of the country born after independence
 ye vakya porbandar kaa he jahaan bijepi ne gujarati nae saal ke avasar par ek kaarykram kaa aayojan kiya tha
 State Agriculture Minister Babu Bokharia was the chief guest here
 yahaan maujuud logon ko sambodhit karte hue babu bokharia ne kaha ki 1947 main jab desh aaazaad hua to zyaadaatar congressi chaahate the ki narendra bhai modi pradhanmantri bane
 Modi's name was replaced by Patel
 Actually Babu Bokharia wanted to say that Kikangrasi wanted to see Sardar Patel as Prime Minister but Narendra Modi's name got out of his mouth
 narendra modi kaa janm hi 17 sitambar 1950 ko hua tha yani aazaadee milane ke puure teen saal ek maheene or do din baad
 It is worth noting that elections have been announced in Gujarat and there is a lot of fierce fighting between BJP and Congress
 bijepi congress par sardarpatel ko lekar hamalaa karti rahi he or unhen nehru se bada batakargandhi parivaar ko katghare main khadaa karti rahi he
 Gujarat has 18 per cent Patel votes and this is also said to be one of the major reasons for bjp's Patel love
 isi kram main babu bokharia bhi congress ko gherne ko koshish main khud hi galati kar baithe

 Yadav said he had warned Jaya Prada to use the flasher once even two months ago
 ve kehete hai, ‘‘jab unki gaadi shahar main daakhil hui to flashar jal rahaa tha
 "uttar Pradesh Transport Minister Durga Prasad Yadav answers a question on whether the law is right or wrong to apply lawful flasher," the matter is being investigated
 jo bhi niyam virudgh hoga, uske khilaaf karrwai hogi
 "when asked why Jaya Prada's car was stopped in Rampur, Durga Prasad repeats the same rote reply," the case is being investigated
 ’’jaya pradaa ne kaushalendra yadav ke khilaaf abhadra vyavhaar kaa bhi aarope lagaaya he
 But he denies any such accusation
 "when he held the press conference immediately after the incident, there was no accusation of holding hands or behaving indecently
 ve is ghatana ko rajnatik rang dene kii koshish kar rahi hai
 "kaushalendra challenges Jaya Prada," i will resign from my job if Jaya swears by his son and says that i have treated him indecently
 lekin flashar vaali batti lagaakar aaengi to dobaaraa utaar duungaa
 "this battle started with the use of red light has now reached the political corridors of Delhi via Rampur

 Rampur is perhaps the only city in Uttar Pradesh, where rules and regulations are followed
 afasarshahi hameshaa ek pair par khadi rahati he
 There is not even a pit to be found on the streets
 koi autowala bina vardi or license ke gaadi nahin chalaata
 Traffic on the road follows the rules
 shahar main kabhi batti nahin gul hoti
 The officials are afraid of taking bribe because the bribe may not be Azam Khan's man himself
 nagarpalika ke offis main clerk se lekar adhikari tak apni kursi par baithe dikhaai dete hai, filein samay par nibatai jaati hai
 In such a situation, the needle of suspicion stops and turns towards them
 haalanki ajam khan aise kisi aarope se inkaar karte hai ki yah unke ishaare par hua he
 There is also anger within the SP about this incident
 party sutron kaa kahana he ki jaya pradaa ke prati ajam khan ke rukh ko lekar mulaayam singh yadav pehle bhi apni naaraazgi jaahir kar chuke hai
 SP MP Naresh Aggarwal has supported Jaya Prada
 ve kehete hai, ‘‘unke saath hua vyavhaar niyam virudgh he

 aakhir khantee bihar he kya? bhugolic rup se yah ganga ke madhya maidan ke bade hisse main faili sapaat or samtal bhoomi he
 However, it is full of geographical diversity
 uttar kaa maidan prachur maatra main jhiilon or pokharon se bharaa haraa-bharaa ilaaka he to dakshin ke maidan main bich-bich main pahadibhan hai
 The major rivers Ganga and Kosi flow south from the Himalayas, while the Son River flows north from the Amarkantak hills
 teenon dharti ko upjau banane kaa kaam karti hai
 These are not only the geographical identity of Bihar, but also an indelible part of the culture of Bihar
 isi tarah bihar kii khantee pahchaan kya he? aitihaasik rup se is kshetra kaa charitra mahanagar kii tarah udaar or vyapak rahaa he
 The beginning of the establishment of Raj and Empire in India can also be linked with the Magadha district in the sixth century and the Mauryan Empire three hundred years after that
 praarambhik aitihaasik bihar mahaan bauddhik andolanon kaa bhi janak rahaa he
 Here various religions like Buddhism and Jain originated while the rest of the Aryavarta was implicated in Vedic orthodoxy
 vividhta or virodh bihar ke charitra kii khaasiyat lagate hai
 Not surprisingly, Bihar has been a vanguard of opposition to the colonial rule from the first freedom struggle of 1857 to the Champaran Satyagraha in recent times
 aaazaad bharat main bihar immergency ke khilaaf andolan kaa bhi agua bana
 The literal meaning of Bihar is no different from its character
 yah 'vihaar' shabd kaa apbhransh he jiskaa matlab buddha math hua karata he
 Here Buddhism had such a strong hold that the whole region came to be called Bihar
 lekin 'vihaar' shabd buddha yug ke pehle kaa he
 In the Mahabharata, Vihara means pleasure place, entertainment place
 pracheen bharat main dhire-dhire yah shabd darshanik arthon main istemaal kiya jane laga jiskaa arth jivan ko puri sampoornataa, gaharaai main jeene se liya jane laga
 We find the first mention of the word 'bihar' in the 13th century, tabaqat-e-nasiri, written by Minhaj al-siraj Jujjani
 lekin tab yah naam dakshin bihar ke liye prachlit tha
 Indeed, the presence of Buddhism in northern Bihar was weaker than in the southern part
 haalanki mohammad bin tughlaq (1325-51) ke daur main uttari or dakshini hisse, donon ko ek hi naam—bihar se janaa jane laga tha
 It was then a province of the Tughlaq Empire
 haal ke daur main haalanki bihar kii pahchaan baaki bharat main uske gauravshaalee ateet ke liye nahin rah gai
 There was a negative perception about Bihar
 vah pichhadepan or tehraav kaa pratik ban gaya
 In popular mediums such as Bollywood movies to TV serials, the image of Bihar is projected for backwardness and devotion
 aashcharya he ki bauddhik varg main bhi bihar kii vahi chhavi bani hui he
 They forget two important reasons for his condition
 ek, aupniveshak raaj main bhu-rajnatik sthitiyaan aise banane lageen ki kuch khaas ilaakon kii paramparaagat arthvyavastha ko suniyojit tareeke se chaupat kar diya gaya
 Modern historians will tell how much it cost to lead Bihar in the revolt of 1857
 aazaadee ke baad ke daur main bhi centre ne sansadhano ke aavanton tathaa buniyadi sanrachana vikaas ke maamle main bihar kii upeksha kii or uske vishaal khanij sansadhano (2000 ke pehle) ke munaafe main hissedari dene main kotahi barti
 Many times it seems to be feared that leading states have developed at the cost of backwardness of Bihar
 duusare, bihar ko nicha dikhaane main baaki bharat yah bhul jaataa he ki unke liye bihar jaisaa he, britain yaa australia kii najar main bharat kii vahi sthiti he
 Indians in Britain or Australia behave the same as with Biharis in Mumbai or Delhi
 haalanki haal ke varshon main bihar main ek nayaa adhyay khulaa he or ab bihar main nai jagriti aa rahi he
 If Bihar lags behind, India too cannot grow
 ab phir us mul sawaal par aaie ki bihar kaa khantee charitra yaa uski khaasiyat kya he? is vishay main mahatma gandhi ke uddhran se bhala or behatar kuch kahana kya ho saktaa he
 Gandhi, in my use of his autobiography Satya, has described the character of all Biharis as "humble, simple, good and deeply revered"
 " ve bihar ko aksar ''sundar or pavitra sthaan" yaa ''mere sapanom kii dharti" kaha karte the
 At times, the simplicity of the people of Bihar, speaking bluntly and the humor of some people, they consider their arrogance
 aashaa he, navjagrit bihar apni haal ke varshon main bani nakaaratmak chhavi ko mitaa sakegaa or ek baar phir apane mul arth kii tarah 'anand bhoomi' ban jayega

 Rather, run it in such a way that you do not depend on anyone for your safety
 hamen apane desh main hi suraksha se judi chizon ko bananaa chahie
 Some powers want to hollow the country from inside, Mohan Bhagwat said that there are many kinds of concerns in the country right now, meanwhile some powers want to hollow the country from inside
 kuch kaarnon se apane hi desh ke log bhi in shaktiyon ke saath khadey ho jate hai, in kaarnon ko dur karne kii jarurat he
 The condition of the police in the country is not the same as it should be
 police bal main sudhaar ke liye prastaavon kii baaten abhi tak filon main dhul kha rahi hai
