 Rajamouli's film 'bahubali' broke all the earnings records
 lekin bahubali kii lagaataar tulana aamir khan kii 'dangal' se hoti rahi
 In the recently released 'dangal' in China, he did something amazing that 'bahubali' also beat the earning arena
 lekin ab china ke bade vyapaar kaa phayda uthaane ke liye 'bahubali 2' bhi puri tarah taiyaar he
 While 'dangal', which has been released on nearly 9000 screens in China, has created history and earned a bang, now 'bahubali 2' is also ready to show its strength in China
 media main ai khabaron ke anusaar 'bahubali 2' china main 6000 screens par relies hone kii taiyaari kar rahi he
 Although Prabhas's 'bahubali' has got less screen than 'dangal' in China, but Bahubali has already earned so much that these screens are also expected to earn a lot of money
 media reports ke ansaar china ke alaava 'bahubali' japan, korea or taiwan main relies hogi
 The makers of 'bahubali' want it to get a similar response as 'dangal', so they have joined hands with Chinese distributor company e-star
 bataa den ki i-star hi china main 'dangal' kii distributor he
 If 'bahubali 2' does as much business as 'dangal' in China, then it will easily leave Aamir's film behind
 'bahubali 2' ko china main relies hone main bhale hi abhi time ho lekin film ne bharat main jhande gaad die he
 'bahubali 2' may have time to release in China, but the film has set the flag in India

 diwali se kaaphi pehle se hi gharon kii safai kaa silsilaa shuru ho jaataa he
 But will we just clean the houses or clean their gadgets and online presentations too? People usually clean things from their homes which are old enough and are no longer used
 aisa isliye bhi kiya jaataa he kyonki is bahaane nae saamaan ke liye jagah banaai ja sake
 In the digital world, our own gadgets are also very messy, or rather crowded
 ham aapako kuch aise upaay bataate hai jiske jariye is diwali par aap apane mobile phones, descops or duusare gagetts ko smart tareeke se vyavasthit rakh sakenge
 1
 apane sabhi cabel, chargers or viring ko ikaitha karen
 Most of us have a plethora of cables and chargers
 hamen ye bhi yaad nahin hota ki koun sa cabel kis divaais kaa he
 The interesting thing is that we do not even know whether there is a device in the house for the cable that we have
 pehle ise check karen, lekin agar aapke paas aise computer yaa mobile kaa cabel he jo aapke paas chaar saal pehle tha or use aap istemaal bhi nahin karte to isaki safai kar den
 2
 email kii safai:zyaadaatar logon ke inbox main hajaaron email pade hote hai jinke bare main unhen koi andaja nahin hota
 Not everyone hurries to delete emails
 samay aa gaya he jab aap un imels ko delit kar len jo aapke liye mahatvapurn na hon
 First of all go to the last page of the inbox which will probably be unnecessary for you
 iske alaava tresh foulder or spam foulder ko bhi delit karke isaki safai karen
 3
 jo ap istemaal na karte hon unhen hataa den:zyaadaatar lowepane smartphone main ap downalodkar to lete hai, lekin sirf chand istemaal ke baad use bhul jate hai
 Obviously, if you have not used an app for six months, you will not do it even further
 isliye behatar he ki unhen apni screen ko ganda na karne den or hataa den, kyonki isse aapako duusare ap dhundne main bhi samay lagegaa
 4
 apane data kaa byaap len:apane divaais kii saaf safai se pehle apane inamen rakhe mahatvapurn data, photose or videos ko surakshit rakhane kaa puraa intjaam kar len
 You can resort to external hard drive or cloud storage for data backup
 hard discs aap kharid sakate hai or kai cloud storage free sarvice bhi dete hai
 5
 soshal media kii bhi safai jaruri he:kya aapako soshal media par sach main 10,000 doston kii zarurat he jo aapke wal par lagaataar post kar rahe hon? agar aapako yah yaad nahin he ki aap unase kaise mili, aap unhen berth de vish na karte hon yaa unke apadats main aapaki koi dilchaspee na ho to aap unki safai kar den
 That means unfollow
 6
 Cleaning of bookmarks and speed dial shortcuts of web browsers: On web browsers you will have created many such bookmarks and speed dial shortcuts which you will not even remember
 kuch samay ke liye wo kaam ke to hote hai, lekin kya ab bhi aap unka istemaal karte hai? ab samay aa gaya he jab aap inaki bhi safai karen
 If you have tried your favorite dish or bought a birthday gift, then now it needs to be cleaned
 7
 Clean the Temp files: This is a good time to clean the Temp files in your browser
 agar aap opera yuj karte hai to aapkaa kaam or bhi aasaan he
 All you have to do is click on the second option ie 'delete Private Data' inside the tools
 baaki kya karnaa he aapkaa opera broujar behatar tareeke se guide karegaa
 8
 anti virus or milavayer scan:web browarrars main diya gaya ekstantions khatarnaak websites or link se aapke divaais kii hifaazat kar saktaa he
 For example, in Opera browser, special extensions like WOT and Ghostery have been provided which can prove to be very beneficial for you
 inamen se aap koi chun kar istemaalkar sakate hai
 Apart from this, Google Chrome browser also has many extensions
 internet par mailaware kii bharmaar he jo aapke divaais ko kharaab kar sakate hai isliye aap iskaa khyaal rakhen
 9
 hard drive ke contents or files ko vyavasthit karen:alag alag chizon ke liye alag foulder banaaen or uske naam den taaki aage aapako yaad rahe
 Do not delay in deleting critical files
 isse memory bachegi
 Keeping it organized will also make it easier to find important files and will also save time
 10
 Upper cleaning of the device: Did the internal cleaning of the smartphone, tab and computer
 ab samay he ki aap isaki upree safai bhi karen
 Using the right cleaners can make them look like new again
 gajet kii dukaan se aap inaki safai ke liye sahi products le sakate hai
 Keep in mind that you do not clean your device with soapy water, otherwise you will regret it

 Anyway what is yours apane ko bas pikchar dekhake public ko sahi sahi bataane kaa he
 So the verdict of the film boss is that its fight is right, the rest is wrong
 film ke gane, imoshan or romens kamjor kahani kii bread ke bich main thunse gaye adhpake aalu or masaalon kii overdoj kii tarah hai
 The weak story and conflation turned out to be the boss's boss
 film kahani he bos (akshay kumaar) kii, jise uske satyawadee pita satyakanth shastri (mithun chakravarti) ne ghar se nikaal diya
 Because, the child does not tolerate insulting his father
 ghar se nikle bos ko panaah di prakat rup se transport or paroksh rup se contract tudai kaa kaam karne vaale big bos (danni) ne

 film kii kahani baap-bete ke angel par sabase zyada focus karti he
 But there is not a single scene between Akshay and Mithun, so that those who love our father can be influenced or sentimental
 shiv or aditi kaa romens bhi film main jabaran jhagada paidaa karne ke liye daalaa gaya he
 Shiva's acting is fine and Aditi seems to be told that she was just asked to keep the screenplay of bikini scene and some weak moments on the beach

 The film rests on the shoulders of two people
 akshay or ronit, unhone vahi kiya, jisaki ummid thi
 Akshay made a great fight
 chej seen kiye or jor jor se dialog bole
 He was not able to make him laugh
 haa fite ke dauraan dashing khub lage
 Ronit Rai was able to retain the rigor that could be expected from his character

 Director d'souza had earlier made another mahazhail chat film Blue
 uske baad vah gumnami main gunaguna rahe the
 But it is not necessary that Akshay's film is a flop, so that the director is bad
 ab ham aapako bataa rahe hai akki, inase na ho paaegaa
 This Haryanvi form of Boss defeated our Akshay Kumar
 ye main baar baar hamaare isliye kah rahaa hum kyonki khan bhaaiyon kii tarah akki kii bhi ek badi fain folowing he, jo unki filmon ko jabardast opening kii guarantee detii he
 But after that the story is the boss
 acting bhi jaruri he
 But all of them got out of the way and whatever was shed just kept flowing
 agar mardhaad ke shaukeen hai, to bos dekh sakate hai
 Otherwise what is the use of wetting the pocket

 ' The conflict between the Delhi Government and the Delhi Police has been seen again
 taaja maamla dilli ke mukhyamantri or aam aadmi party ke netaa arvind kejariwal par hue mirch atake se judaa he
 Many mlas of Delhi's Aam Aadmi Party government feel that the Delhi Police under the Central Government does not conduct judicious and neutral investigations in matters related to its leaders
 isliye ab dilli sarkaar ke 21 vidhayakon ne apane mukhiya ko is sambandh main ek chitthee likhi he
 In this letter of Aam Aadmi Party mlas, it has been demanded that the compensation of Rs 1 crore to the family of jawans and officers should not be given to the Delhi Police if the Delhi Government is martyred during work
 is chitthee par aam aadmi party ke 21 vidhayakon ne apane hastakshar kiye hai
 After the chilli powder attack on Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday, the Delhi Police issued a statement and said that 'till now investigation has revealed that the CM powder was not thrown at the CM but was tried

 Passed by CM office
 aaropee susheel kii maa biimaar he, vah sahaayta ke liye siem se mila tha
 The Aam Aadmi Party leaders were angered after this comment by the Delhi Police and they told the Delhi Police conspiracy to save the accused

 In the letter, it has been written that in the last four years, since the Aam Aadmi Party government has been formed in Delhi, there have been many such incidents which were not actually accidents but proved to be a conspiracy done under a thoughtful conspiracy

 In the letter, the legislators wrote, 'one thing can be seen in all these attacks is that the attitude of Delhi Police questions its impartiality

 Delhi Police refused to register a complaint in the attack on Minister Imran Hussain at the Delhi Secretariat

 It is further written in the letter that after the Aam Aadmi Party government came to Delhi, a big announcement was made that if any government employee of Delhi dies on duty, due to some reason, then the Delhi government is the family of that person
 1 crore rupees will be given to Samman but Delhi Police is not doing its job impartially

 12:05 AM People of Patidar Reservation Movement Committee reach Bharat Singh Solanki's house narendra modi sarkaar ne somvaar ko saamaanya varg ko aarthik aadhaar par 10 fisadi aarakshan dekar aitihaasik nirnay kiya
 Just before the Lok Sabha elections, 10 percent reservation in government jobs and education was given to poor upper castes by the government on economic grounds
 vipaksh ne sarkaar ke is faisle ko sirf ek chunavi daanv bataaya he, jabaki bhartiya janata party or sarkaar ne ise aitihaasik kadam qaraar diya he
 If you have some questions related to this decision, then you will get answers here
 
 
 1
 Which part of the reservation will the upper castes get? The Modi government has promised to give 10 per cent reservation to the poor upper castes, this reservation will be different from the 50 per cent given till now
 yani, samvidhan ke anusaar abhi tak sirf 50 fisadi aarakshan diya jaataa he jo ki samaaj ke pichde tabake ko miltaa he
 That is, the government has given the decision to give reservation to the upper castes separately, for this the constitution will have to be amended
 2
 There is no provision in the constitution, how will it be found? Modi government will amend the constitution to implement this decision
 mangalvaar ko hi loksabhaa main samvidhan sanshodhit bill pesh kiya jayega
 The central government will change Article 15 and Article 16 of the Constitution
 donon anuchhed main badlaav kar aarthik aadhaar par aarakshan dene kaa rasta saaf ho jayega
 3
 kya sirf hindu savarnon ko milegaa?aisa bilkul nahin he ki centre sarkaar ke is faisle kaa laabh hindu savarnon ko milegaa
 Apart from Hindus, Muslim and Christian people will also get the benefit of this decision
 udhaaharan ke taur par agar koi muslim saamaanya shrenee main aata he or vah aarthik rup se kamjor he to use 10 fisadi aarakshan kaa phayda milegaa
 4
 patel-jat-maratha andolan kaa ab kya hoga?beete dinon main patel-jat-marathaon ne aarakshan ke liye kai tarah ke andolan kiye hai
 They will also benefit from the decisions of the Modi government, as all these castes are under the upper caste
 aise main in sabhi jatiyon ko bhi aarthik aadhaar par 10 fisadi kaa laabh milegaa
 5
 kise garib mana jayega or kise nahin?modi sarkaar ne is faisle ke saath hi kuch sharten bhi lagu kar di hai
 Under this decision, those whose income is less than Rs 8 lakh per annum will get the benefit of this decision, in addition to those who have less than 5 hectares of land, they will also get the benefit of 10% reservation
 jin savarnon ke paas 1000 squaire feet se kam kaa ghar hoga, jinke paas nigam kii 109 gaj se kam adhishuchet jameen hogi, 209 gaj se kam kii gaiyr-adhishuchet jameen hogi or jo bhi kisi aarakshan ke antargat nahin aate honge un sabhi ko iskaa laabh milegaa
 6
 kya court main sarkaar kaa ye daanv tik paaegaa?darasal, samvidhan ke anusaar aarakshan sirf saamaajik asamanta ke aadhaar par diya jaataa he yani aarthik aadhaar par milane vaala aarakshan gaiyr-sanvaidhanik he
 Many state governments have tried to give reservations on economic grounds, but when the case goes to court, it is rejected on the grounds of being non-constitutional
 aise main centre sarkaar ke saamne samvidhan main sanshodhan karne kii chunauti hogi
 7
 kin naukariyon main ye aarakshan milegaa, centre-rajya yaa nigamon kii?modi sarkaar kaa ye laabh sarkari naukariyon or shiksha ke kshetra main milegaa
 This decision of the Modi government will be applicable in the entire country, in such areas, where there is a provision for reservation, the benefit of this decision will be directly in the jobs of the center-state and the corporation
 8
 Will the states also be able to give such reservation? Whenever the state governments have tried to give reservation on economic basis in the recent past, the court has declared it illegal
 aise main agar ab isko lekar samvidhan main sanshodhan kiya jaataa he, to phir rajya sarkaron ke liye 50 fisadi se alag aarakshan dene kaa rasta khul saktaa he
 From Mandal Commission to Savarna reservation, read the timeline of reservation in the country, will Savarna reservation be applicable before the election? This is the whole process of constitution amendment bill badminton main chini dabadabe ko chunauti dene vaali ekmaatr bhartiya sina nehwal ummid lagaae hai ki unka landan olympic kaa kaansya padak kam se kam aadha darjan khilaadiyon ko unke saath sheersh str par pahunchane or parpanrik powerhouse ko chunauti dene ke liye prerit karegaa

 Voices are getting louder to give Ruchika full justice
 is bich, doshi purv dijipi rathore kaa police medal waapas lene par soch-vichaar chal rahaa he
 The central government is looking at what are the ways of withdrawing the medal
 rathore ko 1985 main vishesh seva kaa police medal diya gaya tha
 The dissatisfaction that has arisen in the society over the minor punishment awarded to Rathore after a delay of 19 years in the Ruchika case has also caused problems on the forehead of the Central Government
 mana ja rahaa he ki sarkaar ye sandesh dene kii koshish main he ki ruchika ke maamle par sarkaar gambhir he
 The exercise to crack down on former DGP Rathore in the Ruchika Girhotra molestation case has intensified
 is maamle main rathore ko mahaj chah maheene kii sajaa or phir kuch hi der main jamaanat mil jane kii gunj desh bhar main sunai de rahi he
 In view of this, the central government has come into action
 sutron ke mutabik centre 1985 main rathore ko mili police medal ko chhinane ke tareekon par gaur kar rahaa he
 The government will also ask to appeal to the CBI to extend the sentence of Rathore
 rathore ko kaaran bataao notice bhi bheja jayega
 Through this notice, they will be asked why they should be given full pension after being convicted in the CBI court
 ruchika cese main 19 saal baad faisla aayaa tha
 For 19 years, Ruchika's family lived in shock and suffering
 honhaar beti ne chhedhkhani ke kuch saalon ke baad jis tarah khudakushi kar lee thi usase parivaar abtak ubar nahin sakaa he
 It is obvious that Ruchika and her family found it expensive to protest the handiwork of Rathore, a senior police officer at that time in Chandigarh
 kisi ne ruchika kii fariyaad nahin suni
 No one understood the pain of his family
 yahaan tak ki ruchika ke naaballig bhai par cese dar cese darj hote gaye
 The house fell apart
 chat chin gai
 But even after 19 years, when the verdict came, Ruchika's father clearly said that he was joked, not justice

 Annoyed with the Center, Mamata wrote on the social networking site 'facebook', 'we are very serious about these developments and we are ready to take tough decisions if these issues are not reconsidered
 'raajnneetik vishleshkon kaa kahana he ki trinmul congress shaayad samprag sarkaar se alag hone ke bare main nahin bhi soch sakati he, kyonki centre ke paas kai vikalp hai
 Samir Kumar Das, a professor of political science at the University of Calcutta, said, "trinamool is not in a position to break away from the central government and achieve anything
 isliye mamata faisle par phir se vichaar karne ke liye centre par dabaav daalane kaa prayaas sakati hai yaa congress ko bich kaa rasta apnaane ke liye baadhya sakati hai
 That is, you can ask to limit the scope of FDI in retail business

 It can take 202 years for women to get the same salary as men, because the global wage gap is huge and the pace of change is extremely slow
 yah baat vishwa aarthik manch (world Economic Forum) kii report main kahi gai he
 The WEF annual report found that women make 63 percent of the average earnings of men
 149 main se ek bhi desh kaa akalan aisa nahin he, jahaan mahilaon ne ausatan purushon ke baraabar vetan hasil kiya ho
 According to the WEF, the global disparity in wage disparity has narrowed slightly over the past year, but the number of women at workplaces has decreased
 2017 main dablyooef ne anumaan lagaaya tha ki vetan antar ko khatm karne main 217 saal lagenge
 Saadia Zahidi, head of the social and economic agenda at WEF, told 'the Guardian, "the overall picture is that lagged equality has stalled
 hamaare shram bazaar kaa bhavishya utana samaan nahin ho saktaa, jitna hamane ek samay sochaa tha

 Input - IANS yashavir singh kaa parivaar hapur zile ke sitadei gaanv main kheti kar guzar basar karata he
 This time rains and hail have caused havoc that more than 50 per cent of their wheat crop has been destroyed
 enditivi kii team jab yashavir singh ke khet par pahunchi, to vahaan tabaahi kaa manzar saafe dikhaai de rahaa tha
 More than half of the wheat grown in his field has become so bad that it is no longer edible
 yashavir ne 15 bighas main gehun kii fasal bone ke liye kisaan credit card kii madad se 2
 a loan of Rs 50 lakh was taken, but the unseasonal rain did not leave the installment repayable
 yashavir singh ne enditivi se kaha, "bank se notice aa rahe hai ki karj waapas kiya jaae
 Now i either have to sell the land or i have to sell the animals, so that i can repay the bank loan
 " Yashveer Singh says that the loss is too much, so the loan should be forgiven, compensation will not help
 vah kehete hai, "hamen sarkaar se check ke zariye koi madad nahin chahie
 The debt that we have taken, be forgiven
 "badahaal kisaanon kii mushkil ye he ki fasal barbaad hone ke baad bhi bahut sara kharchaa baaki he
 The crop of wheat farmer Kamal Singh has been destroyed by 90 percent
 enditivi kii team jab unke khet par pahunchi to paaya ki unke khet main nuksaan kaaphi zyada he
 Kamal Singh says, "money has to be spent to remove bad crops
 
 
 mazdoor nahin mil rahe hai
 
 
 Now we have to prepare for the next crop
 
 
 " In Sitadei village we found Rampal Singh, who lives in Dadara village, 2 km from Sitadei village
 jab ham unke khet par pahunche, to vahaan bhi nazaaraa sitadei gaanv jaisaa hi tha
 Says Rampal Singh, "now children's fees are not being collected
 pichley saal ke ganne ke paise bhi abhi tak nahin mili hai
 "this time the rain in Hapur district has caused such a devastation on pea farmers that they have nothing left
 hapur ke sitadei gaanv ke omveer singh ne 7
 The pea crop was sown in 5 bighas
 jab ham unke khet par pahunche, to hairaan rah gaye
 The peas crop was not even left in the fields, everything was ruined and weed grew all around
 omveer singh kehete hai, ab matar kii fasal tabah hone ke baad ek rupee bhi kamai nahin ho paaegi
 On the contrary, more money will also have to be spent in cleaning the farm
 do maheene ho chuke hai
 No one has come from the administration to take stock of the losses caused to the farmers
 omveer singh ne matar bone ke liye 30,000 kaa karz liya tha
 But even if compensation is received for the wasted crop, only 8,000 rupees will be in hand, which will not make up for the loss
 omveer singh ne enditivi se kaha, "yaa to hamaare bijli bill maaf kar die jaaen yaa hamaara karz maaf kar diya jaae
 Where will we pay the electricity bills? ”omveer Singh is not the only one in Sitadei village of Hapur who has lost a lot
 yahaan badahaal kisaanon kii suchi kaaphi lambii he
 They have suffered so much that it is becoming difficult to run a family
 darasal hapur ke is gaanv main kisi kisaan ko abhi tak koi muawza nahin mila he, lekin unki asal chintaa muawza nahin, qarz he
 They demand that their loan be forgiven
 ye kisaan chaahate hai ki sarkaar muaavze dene kii jagah unki karz maafee ke liye jaldi pahal kare
 Whether they are wheat farmers or peas, the farmers of Hapur claim that the extent of their losses is so large that the compensation amount fixed by the UP government is insufficient to compensate them
 unki maang he ki sarkaar ko unke karz or bijli bill maaf karne kii taiyaari jaldi shuru kerani chahie
 The alliance between the Aam Aadmi Party and the Congress in the Lok Sabha elections in 2019 is still clouded by suspicion

 The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has re-offered an alliance with the Congress in Delhi, Haryana and Chandigarh for the Lok Sabha elections on Saturday, terming BJP President Amit Shah and Prime Minister Narendra Modi a threat to the country
 party ne haalanki is baar gathbandhan ke formule se punjab kii maang ko hataa liya he
 Senior Aam Aadmi Party leader and Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said, 'modi and Shah pair is dangerous for the country
 ise rokane ke liye aap sabhi bhaajapa virdohi sanghathanon ke saath haath milaane ko taiyaar he
 He said, 'there is still time, if the Congress wants, the modi-shah duo can be defeated in 18 seats (haryana, Delhi and Chandigarh)
 ye congress ko tay karnaa he ki is samay praathamikta modi or shah kii jodi ko haraana he yaa zyada siton ladane kaa record banane kaa
 It is worth mentioning that till date, AAP was in alliance with Congress in 33 seats in Punjab, Haryana and Delhi
 abhi bhi vaqt he modi shah kii jodi ko 18 siton ( haryana, dilli or chandigarh) par haraane kaa, agar congress chaahe to
 The AAP on Friday had formally announced an alliance with the Jan Nayak Janata Party (JJP) in Haryana, while the Congress only made it clear the compulsion to form an alliance with the AAP in Delhi

 In fact, after the theft in the temple on Saturday night, when people arrived to visit on Sunday morning, the door of the temple was open and the crocodile was roaming inside
 sthaneey logon kaa maananaa he ki devi khodiar kaa vaahan magaramchh he, aise main mandir ke garbhagrih tak magaramchh kaa aana kisi divie shakti kaa nateeja he
 After the arrival of crocodiles to the sanctum sanctorum of the temple, a large number of devotees reached and worshiped to see the faith of divine power
 logon ne magaramchh par phool or paison kaa chadhaava bhi chadhaaya
 The boy of the temple priest says that the crocodile, the vehicle of the goddess, reinforces the faith and faith in the temple

 i wish i were with them
 main hairaan hum ki deepika kyon urvashi ko aayna nahin dikhaa pain, jo ki deepak se bina baat ke naaraaz hai?''i feel bad for Dipika, she is been targeted too strongly for a comparatively small mistake of taking Shree’s name over me 
 
 
 wish i was there to comfort her
 
 Also wondering, what stopped Dipika from showing mirror to Urvashi for being unreasonably upset with Deepak? - Nehha Pendse (@nehhapendse) October 16, 2018 basapa supremeo mayawati ne aaj abhadra tippanee maamle main kaha ki agar bijepi is sambandh main dayashankar singh ke khilaaf exiaar darj karaati to acha hota
 In fact, thousands of BSP workers took to the streets in Lucknow to demand Dayashankar's arrest
 haalanki prashasan ke aashwaasan ke baad bispi ne dharna 36 ghante ke liye taal diya he
 Mayawati said, Dalits have become angry with BJP by Dayashankar's statement
 main pichhadon ke liye 'devi' ke samaan hum
 Had the BJP registered an FIR in this matter, it would have won my heart
 lekin bijepi ne aupchaarikta bhar nibhaane ke liye dayashankar ko party se baahar kar diya
 On Wednesday, Mayawati also said that the country will never forgive the BJP
 vahiin dayashankar singh ko giraftaar karne ke liye upi police baliya pahunchi, lekin vah vahaan nahin mili
 After the FIR was lodged against Dayashankar, the police found him at at least six places in Ballia, Azamgarh and Lucknow but he was not found
 samaajawaadee party ke netaa benny prasad verma ne kaha ki police dayashankar singh ko dhund rahi he taaki un par kanoonee karrwai kii ja sake
 Today, in the Rajya Sabha, Mayawati raised the issue that earlier Muslims were being targeted in the name of cow slaughter, now Dalits are being targeted
 unhone sabhi dalon se saath aakar aisi chunautiyon kaa saamana karne kii apil kii
 Mayawati said that the BJP should have registered the case taking cognizance of the matter itself, but they did not do so
 mayawati ne kaha ki is prakaar ke hamalon se daliton ke liye ladaai ladane kii meri ichha or pakki ho jaati he
 The Dalit society of the whole country is saddened by Dayashankar's statement
 mayawati ne sadan main aarope lagaaya ki sabhi logon ne daliton kii baat to kii lekin vaastavikta main zyada kuch nahin hota he
 Mayawati said that despite the constitution of Baba Saheb Bhimrao Ambedkar, Dalits are not seen with respect in this country
 congress or bijepi ke lambey shashan ke baad bhi desh main daliton kii sthiti thik nahin he
 Even after so many years of independence, the abuse and oppression of Dalits has not ended

 On Wednesday, Mayawati also said that the country will never forgive the BJP
 vahiin dayashankar singh ko giraftaar karne ke liye upi police baliya pahunchi, lekin vah vahaan nahin mili
 After the FIR was lodged against Dayashankar, the police found him at at least six places in Ballia, Azamgarh and Lucknow but he was not found
 samaajawaadee party ke netaa benny prasad verma ne kaha ki police dayashankar singh ko dhund rahi he taaki un par kanoonee karrwai kii ja sake
 Today, in the Rajya Sabha, Mayawati raised the issue that earlier Muslims were being targeted in the name of cow slaughter, now Dalits are being targeted

 Mayawati said that despite the constitution of Baba Saheb Bhimrao Ambedkar, Dalits are not seen with respect in this country

 IANS se input The Supreme Court on Monday allowed former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister and senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad to visit Kashmir
 court ne apane aadesh main kaha ki vah sirf 4 jilon kaa hi daura kar sakate hai, saath hi vahaan kisi raajnneetik kaarykram main shaamil nahin honge
 Ghulam Nabi Azad has tried to visit Kashmir several times after the withdrawal of Article 370 from the state, but he was not allowed by the Central Government
 court kii ore se kashmir jane kii ijaajat milane ke baad gulam nabi aaazaad ne kaha ki supreme court main daayar meri yachika baakiyon se alag thi
 He said that neither Article 370 was spoken on my behalf nor on the situation in Kashmir, i did not even ask permission to meet relatives in my petition
 aaazaad ne kaha ki main sirf jammu kashmir ke dainik mazdooron kaa haal jaanane ke liye vahaan janaa chahta hum, kyonki mujhe nahin pataa ki ve kaise vahaan jivan yaapan kar rahe hai
 In the Lungrajya Sabha, Leader of Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad said that from apple cultivators to kiln workers, horsemen, laborers live their lives daily and i want to know about their condition
 unhone kaha ki is vakt kashmir kii ek tihaai aabaadi sarkaar ke faisle se prabhavit he or main jaananaa chahta hum ki ve log kaise jinda hai or kaise kamai kar rahe hai
 Azad said that the central government is saying that we have stocked the goods but do people have enough money to buy it? unhone kaha ki kashmir daure par main baramul, anantnag, jammu or srinagar jaaoongaa or vahaan aise logon se milakar unka haal jaanane kii koshish karuunga kyonki unke liye mere man main kaaphi chintaa he
 Targeting only BJP leader going to Kashmir, Azad said that the government is not letting anyone go there
 aaj 43 din baad bhi netaaon ko najarband rakhaa gaya he or sirf sattadhari party ke log hi vahaan ja paa rahe hai
 He said that all the BJP leaders had gone with him in the program of Home Minister which is official
 aaazaad ne supreme court kaa aabhaar jataate hue kaha ki adaalat ne mujhe maanavtaa ke aadhaar par kashmir jane kii ijaajat di he
 On the petition filed in the Supreme Court, Azad said that the Chief Justice himself wants to go to Jammu and Kashmir and the whole country will welcome it as it will make a big difference
 purv mukhyamantri faruk abdulla kii najarbandi par aaazaad ne kaha ki vah soobe ke siem rahe hai, aise main unhone koun sa aparaadh kiya tha jo unpar public sefti act laga diya he

 kol block aavanton maamle main sibiai ne somvaar ko purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh ko clinit de di he
 The investigating agency told the special court that there was no evidence that prima facie indicated that he was part of any conspiracy to allocate coal blocks to the Naveen Jindal group companies
 jharkhand ke purv mukhyamantri madhu kodaa kii yachika par daleel dete hue vishesh lok abhiyojak ares cheema ne adaalat se kaha ki aavedan main dam nahin he
 Koda sought to summon Singh and two others as additional accused in the coal scam case
 cheema ne vishesh sibiai nyaayadhish bharat parashar se kaha ki maamle ke record pratham drushtya bhi sanket nahin dete hai ki tatkaaleen pradhanmantri, jo us vakt koyala mantri bhi the, unka kisi bhi tareeke se kisiaropee ke saath sathganthatha or is baat ko darshane ke liye koi saboot nahin he ki samoochee prakriya main unhone yantric tareeke se kaam kiya
 "koda wants to divert attention", Chima said, "the current application is not only a delay on the part of the accused person to delay the current trial but also divert the attention of the court from the case to the other side
" ’ abhiyojak ne yah bhi kaha ki maamle main sibiai ne vyapak or puri jaanch kii he or adaalat ne kodaa samet 15 aropiyon ko talab karne main koi galati nahin pai
 a charge sheet was filed against him
 jaj se cheema ne aage kaha, 'record pratham drushtya maamle main tatkaaleen pradhanmantri ko aaropee ke taur par talab karne ke liye kuch bhi nahin darshaate hai
 The evidences do not show any connivance on behalf of the then Prime Minister in coal block allocation
 ' unhone aage kaha ki aavedan main koi dam nahin he
 The investigation in the case is comprehensive and complete in all respects
 ham maamle main ab atirikt aaropee ko talab karne kaa koi kaaran nahin pate hai
 Cheema said that when Manmohan Singh was also the coal minister at the time, the allocation of each coal block was finally done by his order and the accused cannot say that just because he had given the final sanction they should be made accused
 aropiyon se sathganthunhone kaha ki sibiai ke maamle ke mutabik jharkhand main sarkari tantra ne anya aropiyon ke saath sathganth kiya tha taaki is baat ko sunishchit kiya ja sake ki koyala block jindal samooh kii companiyon ko aavantit ho or yah kahana sahi nahin hoga ki rajya main jo kuch bhi hua manmohan singh ko uski jaankaree thi
 The court, after hearing the arguments, reserved its order on October 16 on Koda's application
 -input bhashaa se The newly elected legislators of this regional party have demanded Aditya Thackeray to be the chief minister in the new government, with the Shiv Sena's renewed emphasis on an equal share of power with the BJP in Maharashtra
 gauratlab he ki bhaajapa vidhansabha chunaav main apni ummid ke anuroop pradarshan karne main naakaam rahi he
 The ruling BJP lost 17 seats in the results of the assembly elections announced on Thursday
 nivartmaan vidhansabha main bhaajapa ke paas 122 siten hai
 The development led political analysts to believe that the Uddhav Thackeray-led party could bargain hard
 haalanki, shivasena kii siton kii sankhya bhi 2014 ke 63 kii tulana main ghat kar 56 ho gai he
 Pratap Sarnaik, MLA from neighboring Thane city, said, "we want to see Aditya Thackeray becoming the next chief minister
 lekin uddhavji antim faisla lenge
 He said this in response to a question
 darasal, unase poocha gaya tha ki kya shivasena bhaajapa ke maujuuda mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis ke sthaan par apana khud kaa mukhyamantri banane ke liye congress-rakanpa gathjod kii madad legi
 Sarnaik and other newly elected mlas gathered at 'matoshree' (thackeray family residence) on Saturday to attend a party meeting
 chunaav se pehle congress chhod kar shivasena main shaamil hue party ke ek anya vidhayak abdul sattaar ne bhi sarnike ke vichaar kaa samarthan kiya
 Sattar said, "uddhavji will take a final decision on this
 '' unhen pehle purv mukhyamantri ashok chavaan kaa kareebi sahyogi mana jaataa tha
 In the state assembly elections held on October 21, BJP won 105 seats, Shiv Sena won 56 seats
 vahiin, rakanpa 54 or congress 44 siton par vijayi rahi
 The election results have shocked the BJP as the party aimed to form the government on its own with an absolute majority
 lekin chunaav nateezon ke baad badale raajnneetik paridrishy ne shivasena kaa manobal badha diya he jo bakhubi jaanati he ki vah saudebaaji karne kii sthiti main he or mukhyamantri pad ke liye aditya ke naam par muhar lagava sakati he
 Aditya (29) has become the first person in the Thackeray family to enter and win electoral politics since the party's formation in the 1960s
 vah mumbai kii varli seat se jite hai, jo shivasena kaa garh he
 On Thursday, the Shiv Sena, showing its stern stance, reminded the BJP of the "50: 50 formula" that was agreed between BJP president Amit Shah, Thackeray and Fadnavis ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 sutron ke mutabik is formule ke mutabik shivasena or bhaajapa ke chakree aadhaar par mukhyamantri honge or donon dalon ko cabinet main baraabar sankhya main jagah milegi
 Thackeray had said, "I (shiv Sena) contested fewer seats in Lok Sabha and Assembly elections
 main har baar bhaajapa ke liye jagah nahin chhod saktaa
 i want to remind the BJP of the formula which was made in the presence of Amit Shah
 ''maharashtra main kuch dilachasp sambhaavna ke bare main atakalein us vakt shuru hui thi, jab chunaav nattejey ke din purv mukhyamantriyon evam congress ke netaa ashok chavaan or prithviraj chavaan ne kaha tha ki party ko bhaajapa ko satta se dur rakhane ke liye har vikalp par vichaar karnaa chahie
 However, NCP chief Sharad Pawar denied supporting the Shiv Sena
 vahiin, maharashtra congress pramukh balasaheb thoraat ne bhi bhaajapa ko satta se dur rakhane ke liye shivasena se haath milaane se inkaar kar diya
 However, he said, "if the Shiv Sena comes up with a proposal, the (state) Congress will seek advice from its high command
 '' shivasena aditya kaa naam rajya ke agle mukhyamantri yaa up mukhyamantri ke taur par pesh kar rahi he
 However, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP President and Union Home Minister Amit Shah have repeatedly said that Fadnavis will continue as the Chief Minister

 The last 4 teams of ICC World Cup-2019 are almost decided
 australia, bharat, england ne nokout round ke liye apni jagah pakki kar lee he
 At the same time, New Zealand will be replaced from fourth place, when Pakistan's team will be able to beat Bangladesh by more than 300 runs, which is impossible
 darasal, pakistan kaa net ran rate newjiland se kam he
 The mathematics of net run rate has almost ended Pakistan's journey to this World Cup
 aaie samajhate hai net ran rate kii puri kahani
 Why the net run rate is needed? In a one-day tournament, the net run rate is required when two teams have equal points
 aisi sthiti main kisi ek team ke chayan ke liye yah ek saamaanya pranali hoti he
 The team which is on edge in net run rate goes ahead in the tournament
 net ran rate toornament ke us match ke nikaale jate hai, jiske rigelt aa chuke hai
 How the net run rate is calculated, divide the number of runs that the team has scored in the number of overs they have played
 ise aap aasaan shabdon main prati over ballebaaji kaa ausat bhi kah sakate hai
 Now take out how many runs scored per over against that team, that is, what the bowling average was
 iske baad ballebaaji se gendbaaji ausat ko ghataane se net ran rate nikal aayega
 It became largely a matter of extracting the net rate
 ab udhaaharan ke taur par aise samajhen
 If the team batting first wins

 BJP has high hopes from Odisha this time
 bijepi kii ummid ko biju janata dal (bijd) ke pramukh naveen patnayak ne ek letters likhakar nae pankh laga die hai
 In fact, Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik has praised the bjp-led NDA government at the Center for helping in dealing with cyclone 'phani'
 is chakravaat se rajya main kareeb 64 logon kii maut ho gai he jabaki paanch lakh se adhik parivaar beghar ho gayi hai
 The special thing is that during the election campaign, the BJD, which accused the BJP of ignoring the interests of Odisha, has now praised the central government
 ab is tarif ke myne nikaale ja rahe hai
 Friendship through Fani? Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik said in a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi that i thank the Central Government for helping the State of Odisha to effectively deal with the very severe cyclone Phani and the subsequent situation
 saath hi mitti kaa tel dene kii manjuuri par petroleum mantri dharmendra pradhan ko bhi dhanyavad diya
 Patnaik requested Modi to build five lakh houses under the Prime Minister Housing Scheme in this cyclone-affected state
 isse pehle piem modi ne odisha kaa daura kiya tha or naveen patnayak kii tarif kii thi
 During this time PM Modi had said that Naveen Patnaik ji did a good job during the storm
 tufaan ke dauraan odisha ke logon ne samajhadaari dikhaai
 Patnaik to be a part of NDA? Odisha has 21 Lok Sabha seats
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main odisha kii 21 main se 20 siten bijd jeetne main safal rahi thi
 Naveen Patnaik's party BJD has also been with the NDA earlier
 aise main sambhaavna he ki narendra modi ko sarkaar banane ke liye agar kuch siton kii avashyaktaa padati he to bijd apana samarthan de sakati he
 At the same time, BJP can support BJD in the assembly
 bijepi ko acha pradarshan kii he ummidahaalanki, odisha main bijepi is baar damakham se chunaav ladi he or use ummid he ki bijd ke garh main vah tagdi sendhamari karegi
 In such a situation, it has to be seen how the BJP performs in the Lok Sabha elections in Odisha and if the BJD repeats the performance of 2014, will it become a part of the NDA or not? Every news of the election will be received directly in your inbox

 log in purv sieji vinod raay ne ek kitaab likhi he, 'note just encoutent'
 Prior to this book, the UPA government was engulfed in controversies before all of Rai's statements
 ab is kitaab ke bazaar main aane par bhi aisa hi mana ja rahaa he ki tamaam vivaad honge or kuch ansulajhe sawaalon ke jawaab milenge
 In a special conversation with NDTV, former CAG Vinod Rai said everything
 enditivi se baatcheet main vinod raay ne kaha ki maine kabhi nahin kaha ki koun jimmedaar he? meri raay main piem manmohan singh ko koyala ghotaale main nahin ghasita janaa chahie
 As soon as the matter was brought to Manmohan Singh's attention, he took steps, but unfortunately the Coal Ministry was no longer with him and then the ministers who became, took decisions at their discretion
 pradhanmantri kii najar main yah baat rahi yaa na rahi ki jo nirnay unhone koyala mantri rahete liye the vah lagu hue ki nahin
 The former CAG said that even though the former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was not disturbed, the system did not listen to the PM
 phir bhi system kii galati kii jimmedaari piem kii maani jaaegi
 According to former Union Minister Kapil Sibal, there was no loss in 2G
 is baat par purv sieji ne kaha ki manmohan singh chaahate to telecom scam ko roak sakate the
 He said that if the reply of the former telecom minister, one Raja, was not different then the pm's reply would have been a scam
 unhone kaha ki yah mudda jioem main uthaaya janaa chahie tha, jaisaa piemo, vitt mantralay or kanoon mantralay ne kaha tha, lekin aisa nahin hua
 The former CAG said that we have never mentioned the words scam, scam or corruption in our report
 ek sawaal ke jawaab main unhone kaha ki sieji report ko taiyaar karte samay kabhi bhi sarkaar ke mantri yaa piem ke saath saajha nahin kii jaati
 He said that while preparing the report it can never be shared with anyone
 unhone kaha ki sieji sansad ke liye report taiyaar karti he
 Former CAG opinion said that no report is ever fully agreed upon
 koi na koi virodh karegaa hi karegaa
 On the CAG report in the Air India case, former Civil Aviation Minister Praful Patel said that he has nothing to do with the scam
 ullekhneey he ki patel ne raay ko kanoonee notice tak bhejne kii dhamkee di he
 Rai said that there are many such reports which are not discussed
 patel ke mantri rahete hue air india ne 28 jahaaj kharidne kii baat kahi
 But as a minister, Patel returned his proposal and talked about a long-term plan
 baad main air india ne 50 aircraft kharidne kii maang kii
 This scheme was worth 38 thousand crores
 isse air india ko salanaa kaaphi ghaataa uthaanaa padaa
 The biggest meeting of the rebels of the Aam Aadmi Party is taking place in Gurgaon today, which has been named the 'swaraj Samvad'
 ye baithak party kii piesi or rashtriya kaaryakarini se nikaale gaye yogendra yadav or prashanth bhushan ke netritv main ho rahi he
 When asked about this meeting, Yogendra Yadav said that from 10 am to 5 pm, this meeting will be held in Gurgaon
 yogendra ne party par vyangy karte hue kaha ki baithak main media kii bhi entry hogi, mobile phone kii ijazat hogi
 
 
 (in the recent meeting of aap's PAC and National Executive, neither there was a media entry nor permission to carry mobile phones) The big question is whether Yogendra Yadav, Prashant Bhushan can declare a new party
 Huh? According to the Yogendra Yadav camp, the online response that they have received, according to them, about 4200 people have given their response and about 43 per cent have voted for 'a new beginning', while about 40 per cent have said that the party Should 'try to get it out of the wrong hands'
 ab sawaal he ki is baithak main kitne walantirs aaenge?ye khemaa jo daawa kar rahaa he, uske mutabik hazaron walantirs deshbhar se is baithak main jutenge
 About 100 candidates who had contested the Lok Sabha elections on the party's ticket claim to attend the meeting
 daawa ye bhi he ki party ke kareeb das vidhayak is kheme ke sampark main hai, lekin abhi tak keval timarpur se vidhayak pankaj pushkar kaa aana tay mana ja rahaa he
 Social activist Aruna Roy and senior journalist Kuldeep Nayar claim to attend the meeting
 aam aadmi party is baithak ke bare main kya soch rahi he? party ke varisht netaa sanjay singh ne kaha ki ye party kii baithak nahin he or party ke jo bhi log isamen shaamil honge, un par party nazar rakh rahi he or is bare main faisla party kii piesi or rashtriya kaaryakarini karegi
 Last month, the Aam Aadmi Party fired some of its senior and founding members from the party's decision-making political affairs committee (PAC) and national executive on charges of anti-party activities, after which they are also expected to be fired
 aise main yah sawaal bana hua he ki kya ye log nai party banaaenge? Actor Chandan Prabhakar, who appeared in Comedy Nights with Kapil, praised Ranveer Singh
 unka kahana he ki ranvir singh superstar hai lekin vah kabhi superstar jaisaa vyavhaar nahin karte hai
 He is very gentle
 chandan ne haal hi main ranvir singh ke saath 'da kapil sharma sho' kii shooting kii thi
 He said, "ranveer Singh is a superstar, but during the shooting he treated me as if he was my relative
 unamem superstar jaisi akad nahin he isliye main sahaj rahaa kyonki mujhe aisa nahin laga ki main kisi bade bollywood star ke saath khadaa hum
 "chandan said," He behaved like a brother
 vah hamaare saath bahut acchhee tarah rahe or sara ali khan bhi jameen se judi or saral swabhaav kii hai
 They helped give our best

 agast 2014 main team nideshak kaa pad sanbhaalane vaale shastri ke alaava sahaayak kochon sanjay bangad (ballebaaji), bharat arun (gendbaaji) or aar shridhar (kshetrarakshan) kaa kaarykaal vishwa tii20 ke saath samaapt ho rahaa he
 Since retirement in 2013, Hussey has joined various teams as a consultant
 pichley saal ekadivasiy world cap ke dauraan unhone dakshin africa team ke saath salaahkaar kii bhoomika nibhaai thi jabaki aagaamee world tii20 main vah australian team se derren liman ke sahaayak ke taur par judenge
 Hussey said that he told Laxman that he wanted to start as an assistant coach but the Indian cricketer believed that he was capable of coaching the international team
 hasi ne likhaa, ‘vivies ne mana ki paariwarik kaarnon se meri is kaam main ruchi nahin he
 But he was not willing to believe that i am not of such level of work
 hasi ne anusaar lakshmana ne unase kaha tha ki aapane lambey samay tak kaaphi acchhee tarah khel khelaa he or aapako pataa he ki kya karne kii jarurat he isliye aapako apni kshamta par andeh nahin karnaa chahie
 Indian Air Force's airstrike by entering Pakistan against terrorism is just one step, more such steps can be taken now
 vayusena ke pramukh air chif marshall bies dhanoa somvaar ko jab media se rubaru hue to unhone isi prakaar ke sanket die
 BS Dhanoa has said many times that the operation against Pakistan is still going on, so he cannot give more details
 darasal, press conference main jab bies dhanoa se Mig-21 ke bare main sawaal kiya gaya to unhone saaf kaha ki hamaare paas jo bhi vimaan hai ham unka istemaal karte hai, sirf isi vimaan kaa istemaal kyon kiya gaya ye nahin bataaya ja saktaa kyonki oparation abhi bhi jari he
 India is cautious that it is clear that Pakistan may be claiming that it has extended the hand of peace and has started taking action on terrorists
 lekin, bharat abhi bhi satark he or pakistan par kisi tarah kaa bharosa karne ko taiyaar nahin he
 Even after ending the hideout of the terrorists in Balakot, India has repeatedly said that if the terrorists have to take more stringent steps to eliminate them, we will take them
 jiske baad se hi pakistan baikfoot par he or lagaataar duniya ke deshon se apil kar rahaa he ki bharat hamaare upar koi bada ection le saktaa he
 Why big action is still necessary? Significantly, big action is still to be done because jaish-e-mohammed's leader Maulana Masood Azhar is still alive
 bhale hi uski maut kii afvaah udi, lekin pushti nahin ho pai he
 Apart from this, many big commanders of Jaish are still alive
 haalanki, bharat kii airstrike main balakot jaisaa bada training camp to tabah ho hi gaya he
 The Prime Minister also warned that Prime Minister Narendra Modi also made his intentions clear at a rally in Gujarat on Monday
 unhone kaha ki puure desh is baat par ekamat he ki aatanki thikaanon kaa khaatmaa hona chahie
 We should have full confidence in our armies and soldiers
 lekin, kuch log abhi sena par sawaal khadey karte hai

 airstrike par bole vayusena chif- ham target udaate hai, kitne mare ye nahin gin sakate After the announcement of the Prime Minister's MP Adarsh gram Yojana, there was a lot of enthusiasm among the people
 iske tahat puure desh ke saansadon ko teen-teen gaanvon ko god lekar uske sampurna vikaas ke liye yojanaayen chalaane kii baat kahi gai thi
 So that it can become an example for other villages
 lekin teen saal bitne ke baad bhi adhiktar adarsh gram main abhi tak buniyadi suvidhaayen bhi muyssar nahin hai
 In Jharkhand too, the Adarsh gram Yojana has failed
 hairaani kii baat yah he ki beete janvari main ranchi ke saansad ke god liye adarsh gram vaale panchayat main opium kii avaidh kheti bhi pai gai thi
 Actually, even after three years, no project was completed
 namkum ilaake ke hahaap gaanv ko bijepi saansad ramtahal choudhary ne teen saal pehle ko god liya tha
 In the initial phase, the work of implementing the schemes started loudly, but then the matter did not go ahead
 hairaani kii baat yah he ki saansad mahoday god lene ke baad se is gaanv main maatr do yaa teen baar hi aae hai
 In fact, under Adarsh gram where people were promised to have pucca houses as well as water, electricity, health, education in the house
 wo bhi kahin najar nahin aata
 There was talk of providing water to people at home and installing a water tank in the house has not started
 gaanv main bijli ke liye khambhe to gad gaye, taar bhi lag gaye, kuch dinon ke liye bijli bhi ai, lekin ab yahaan bijli ke darshan kabhi-kabhaar hi hote hai
 People are dependent on the only solar panel in the village for mobile charging needs
 gaanv main pine ke pani ke liye kal bhi laga lekin ek sijan ke baad se wo bhi sookhaa padaa he
 People depend on a single well for drinking water
 jiskaa pani bhi kaaphi ganda he
 People have to filter its water to drink
 vahiin, shauchalay kaa nirmaan to hua lekin pani ke abhaav main log uskaa upyog nahin karte
 As far as education is concerned, the only state-run middle school in the village has 100 students enrolled, but only 2 teachers above them
 isame se ek aksar vibhageeya kaary main hi vyast rahete hai
 In such a situation, the villagers are very disappointed and do not shy away from expressing their displeasure
 saansad ne nahin chunaa doosraa gaanvadarsh gram ke tahat milane vaali suvidhaon ke ab tak shuru nahin hone kii baat gaanv kii mukhiya bhi maanati hai
 They say that the situation here gets worse due to lack of water during summer
 unka maananaa he ki yojanaayen shuru to huin par ab tak puri nahin huin
 The chief said that the health sub-center is most needed in the village, but even after pleading no work has been done so far
 vaise saansad mahoday ne apana doosraa gaanv bhi ab tak nahin chunaa he
 Whereas all the mps had to adopt three villages according to the instructions of the Prime Minister
 jharkhand ke duusare saansadon kaa bhi kamobesh yahi haal he
 BJP has 12 mps out of 14 in Jharkhand and the condition of the villages for their adoption is more or less the same

 wo kehete hai ki unhone sardaar singh se is bare main baat kii he or sardaar or unke rishte behad achche hai
 They also say that there is no division or group in the Indian team, so this team is giving good results
 wo ye bhi kehete hai ki unhone kisi coach yaa khilaadi ke prati asammaan kii bhaavana nahin dikhaai

 After this information from intelligence sources, when the security forces reached there, the locals blocked the roads and started throwing stones at them
 andeshaa he ki sthaneey pradarshnakariyon ne aatankiyon ko bhagane main madad ke liye pattharav kaa sahaara liya or kuch ghanton baad patharbaji ruk gai

 This is the reason why Hariprasad has come to be known as 'rahul's voice' in Karnataka
 hariprasad ne 'ajtak' se khaas baatcheet main kaha, 'hamaare adhyaksh jab hindi main bolte hai to log saath hi saath kannada main uskaa matlab jaananaa chaahate hai, isliye main ab main unki kannada main wais ban kar yahaan gum rahaa hum
 How does it feel to be called "rahul's voice"? In response to this question, Hariprasad said, "I have campaigned a lot in North India for the party
 mujhe khushi he ki ab mujhe unke bhaashan kaa anuwaad karne kaa mauka mil rahaa he
 I'm liking it

 When Anna started the movement, many people came and many went

 Actually, discord in the Pawar family has not started with Ajit's going with the BJP, but its foundation was laid during the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 baad main vidhansabha chunaav ke vakt pavaar parivaar main vivaad khulkar saamne aa gaya
 During the Lok Sabha elections, a dispute arose within the NCP on the issue of giving ticket to the son of Ajit Pawar (ajit Pawar)

 It is said that Ajit Pawar was very angry with this whole incident and said that if his son had got the ticket on time, the results would have been different
 duusari taraf, vidhansabha chunaav ke vakt bhi tikat bantwaare ke mudde par party ke andar matbhed kii sthiti dikhi
 At the same time, Rohit Pawar, grandson of another brother of party chief Sharad Pawar, won the assembly elections
 jaankaron kii maane to rohit ke udai or vidhansabha chunaav main unki jeet se ajit pavaar ke andar asuraksha kii bhaavana or badi
 Apart from this, many opposition parties, including Congress, claim that the BJP blackmailed Ajit Pawar, as the ED is investigating against Ajit in the money laundering case and the sword of action is hanging on him

 bihar ke purv upmukhyamantri or pratipaksh ke netaa tejasvi yadav ne shanivaar ko kaha ki rashtriya adhyaksh lalu prasad ke saath srijan ghotaale ke garh bhagalpur ko prasthaan kar chuke hai
 It is from the very heart of creation that they will expose the creators of the creation scam or the wicked of creation
 badi machhliyon ko bachaaya ja rahaa he: tejasvitejasvi ne kaha kiis maamle main stano, telephone or computer oparator jaise chote-chote karmiyon kii giraftaar dikhaakar jaanboojhkar badi machhliyon ko bachaaya ja rahaa he

 Scam when Sushil Modi was the Finance Minister: Tejashwi said that despite the involvement of big leaders of JDU and BJP, they have not been registered till now
 rajkeey kosh ke dhan ko gaiyrkanoonee tareeke se idhar-udhar kar jahaan-tahaan nivesh kar diya gaya, bandar baant machaai gai or nijee hit ke liye durupyog kiya gaya
 All this happened to Sushil Modi, who was the Finance Minister at this time

 nitish or susheel ke khilaaf ho FIR: tejasvitejasvi ne bayaan main aage likhaa ki chaar baar nitish kumaar ne is ghotaale kii jaanch hone se roak diya

 On the one hand, CBI files FIR against me on its fabricated allegations based on imaginary power and unknown information when i was only 14 years old
 duusari ore saaf-saaf srijan ghotaale ke mukhya sangrakshakon nitish kumaar or susheel modi ke viruddh exiaar darj karne ke bajaae unhen hi sangrakshan pradaan karne main juty he
 The CBI should prove its credibility by immediately filing a case of 120B and 420 on both of them
 ghotaalaa kii vajah se ek hue hai nitish-susheel: tejasvitejasvi ne kaha, 'srijan ghotaalaa sidhe taur par inhen ke sangrakshan main hua he, to in par ab tak exiaar kyon nahin hui he? susheel modi kii bahan isamen aropit he
 Where did the Modi family reach from the black money of the creation scam? jab tak nitish kumaar or susheel modi par exiaar nahin hoti, ham chaiyn se baithne vaale nahin he
 The creation is the wonder of the scam, which Nitish Kumar is sitting with BJP again today

 All three are from OBC (other Backward Castes) communities
 kushvaha kaachhi samudaay se hai, patel lodhi hai or tisare patidaar

 udhar, patidaar ko shaamil karne ke peeche bhi pichley saal june main police firing main chah kisaanon ke maare jane ke baad samudaay ko shant karne kii koshish ke taur par dekha ja rahaa he
 The inclusion of Uma Bharti's loyal brother Prahlada Patel's younger brother in the government has made it clear that the allegiance of the Patel family has changed
 vistaar ke peeche kii raajnneeti is tathy se bhi saaf he ki aam taur par apni sarkaar kii chhavi ko lekar kaaphi sajag rahane vaale chouhan ne ek aise mantri ko bhi shaamil kiya he jiskaa aapraadhik record he
 Not only was a case of "attempted murder" registered against Patel in 2012, but other criminal intimidation and rioting cases are pending against him
 unka betaa monu patel bhi police record main historishiter ke rup main darj he or us par bhi rasuka kaa ek maamla lag chukaa he
 But it seems that the Chief Minister is unfazed by all these things

 Seven cabinet ministers, both lagging behind on social media platforms
 ye hai - menka gandhi, juaal oram, birendra singh, thavarchand gahalot, anant gite, shripad yeso nayak or alphons kannathanam
 Apart from these, there are 10 cabinet ministers who are behind the target given by Modi in the number of followers either on Facebook or Twitter
