 In order to understand the revolutionary alternative that Jinnah represented in the first decade of the 20th century, we have to compare them to the men who symbolized the leadership of Indian Muslims of the 19th century
 unhone saare rasmo-rivaaj or ravaayaten tod di thim
 He opted for a cosmopolitan outfit, ignoring the pajamas with a beard, and his wardrobe had up to 200 of the finest stitched suits
 ve apane ilaake kii bhashaa gujarati yaa urdu kii jagah angreji main baatcheet karte the
 He wooed the Muslim audience
 quran kii aayaton ko uddhrut nahin kiya, yaa shaayad kar nahin sakate the
 He was against the demands of a particular community in politics
 unhen 1905 main bengal ke bantwaare or muslim bahul praant ke gathan ko lekar andeh tha
 He was estranged from the Muslim League, born in 1906 in Dhaka and publicly opposed the League's main demand - the electoral college
 unhen andeshaa tha ki isse bharat kii ekta khatm ho jaaegi
 Even when the demand for a separate Muslim country in the Indian subcontinent began to pick up in the 1930s, Jinnah's ideals were Kamal Ataturk
 ataturk ne osmania khilaafat ko khatm karke majahab se hukumat ko alag kar diya tha
 Ataturk's biography in November 1932, when Jinnah was living in exile on his own free will in London

 According to Chagla, Jinnah went directly to Sir Dinshaw and asked him what he thought about the inter-religious marriage
 sar dinshow ne kaha ki yah shandaar vichaar he or isse rashtriya ekta ko kaaphi madad milegi
 Jinnah slowly demanded Ratti's hand

 Jinnah, who values the law, did not meet Ratti until she turned 18 on 20 February 1918

 Khwaja Razi Haider writes that the Parsis of Bombay were deeply angered by this conversion
 parsi akhabaaron ne shaadi ke din ko 'kaala shuukravaar' ghoshit kar diya
 a case of kidnapping was registered, and when the case reached the court, the judge asked if Jinnah married for money

 In a letter to Syed Mehmood, Sarojini Naidu has presented a very good picture of this marriage: "so, Jinnah finally broke the blue flower of his mind
" yah sab bahut achaanak hua or iskaa jabardast virodh hua or parsiyon main kaaphi naaraazgi thi; lekin mujhe lagata he ki us ladki ne badi qurbaani di he or abhi tak use iskaa ehsaas nahin he
 Jinnah deserves it all — he loves: a love that is truly human and the real sense of his introverted and autistic nature
 ''bombai kii sabase mashhoor or khubasurat dulhan ke taur par ratti apane baalo main taaje phool, heere jadit gahane pahenti thim; hathi ke daant ke holder main rakhi angreji cigarette piti thim; maanik, panne or gale ke kaaphi neeche tak ke reshmi paridhaan pahenti thim jisase bujurg mahilaayein dang rahati thim
 Hector Bolitho referred to host Lady Willingdon's response during a Bombay Government House feast: "the story is that Mrs
 Jinnah was wearing a low-cut dress, which did not please her host
" jab ve sab dining teble par baithe the tab ladi willingdon ne ek edisi se kaha ki misses jinna ko thand lag rahi hogi lihaaja unke liye ek kapadaa le aae
 It is said that Jinnah stood up and said, when Mrs
 Jinnah gets cold, she will tell herself and ask for cloth to cover herself
 '' or phir, lord willingdon jab tak governor rahe tab tak jinna government house dobaaraa nahin gaye
 Ratti was independent in nature

 The strong political storm, which was compounded by a man who remained silent for four years, made the first two decades unimportant
 xxrep 13 * jinna sadak kii raajnneeti se talmail nahin bitha paa rahe the
 The first major differences between Gandhi and Jinnah emerged in the 1920 Congress conventions of Calcutta and Nagpur
 jinna ko laga ki musalamaanon se sneh paane ke maamle main gandhi ne unki jagah le lee he
 He was the only Muslim representative at the Nagpur session who expressed dissatisfaction with Gandhi's proposal of non-cooperation
 unhone kaha ki yah prastaav vastutah purna swatantraaa kii ghoshnaa he or bharat iske liye taiyaar nahin he
 He said that he fully agreed with Lala Lajpat Rai's indictment on the British rule but he does not think that the Congress has yet found a way to end it
 ve ek tarah se bhavishya kii baat kar rahe theah ''
 
 
 This is not the right move at the moment
 aap indian neshnal congress ke saamne aisa kaarykram rakh rahe hai jise aap puraa nahin kar sakate
 His second objection was that non-violence would not work
 yahaan jinna galatfahami main the
 Jinnah did not like the nature of Gandhi's movement
 lekin gandhi kii nai takat ne unhen un khaanon main sharan lene ko vivash nahin kiya jinhen unhone khaarij kiya tha
 Remembering this difference after two decades, Gandhi wrote in Harijan on 8 June 1940: "qaid-e-azam was a great Congressman himself
 asahyog andolan ke baad ve, vibhinn samudaayon se sambandh rakhane vaale kai duusare congressiyon kii tarah, chhod gaye
 Changing his face was completely political
 '' is ghatana kaa ek dilachasp pahalu bhi he
 When Jinnah started his speech at the Nagpur session of December 1920, calling Gandhi as 'mr
 Gandhi', people immediately shouted that they should address him as 'mahatma Gandhi'
 iske baad jab unhone mohammad ali ko 'mistar' kaha to phir naaraazgi bhare swar main kaha jane laga ki unke naam se pehle 'moulana' lagaaein
 In view of the religious implications of 'mahatma' and 'maulana', Jinnah refused to use these words before Gandhi and Muhammad Ali
 darasal, mullaon kii choti jamaat-mohammad ali, unke bhai shaukat ali or abul kalam aaazaad-ne gandhi ko muslim bhaawanaaon ko chune ke liye vaikalpik rasta diya or gandhi ne islam ke aakhri khalipha ke astitv ko bhartiya makasad se joda diya

 The Changhudipal Gram Panchayat of Jajpur district of Odisha is full of mineral wealth
 isi ke tahat aane vaale, pahari par based nagada gaanv ke sania pradhan ke do saal ke bete baliya ne duniya par puri nigaah daali bhi nahin thi ki pichley maheene uski maut ho gai
 At the same time, Siva Pradhan, Babu Pradhan and Balu Pradhan could not even think of the name of their newborn children that they passed away before that
 pichley chaar maheene ke bheetar nagada main kuposhan se 19 bacchon kii maut or 39 bacchon kii gambhir haalat kii khabar jhakzor dene vaali he
 The impact of malnutrition in Odisha can be gauged from the fact that in Nawrangpur district of South Odisha, 355 children have died due to malnutrition in the last six months and about 3,359 children are in the grip of it
 in mauton ne kalahandi main bhukhmaree kii vajah se saikadon mauton kii ghatana kii yaad taaja kar di he
 Nearly 39 children were admitted to the Tata Steel Company hospital in Kaliapani, Sukinda block, Jajpur
 lekin yahaan ab sirf do bachche bache hai
 the rest? Suffering from superstition and illiteracy, the tribals of the Juang community of Nagda ran up the mountain to the village, saving their children from the eyes of the doctors
 26 or 27 july ko aspataal khaali ho gaya
 The Nutritional Rehabilitation Center for Malnourished Children was opened here by the Government of Odisha
 ab yahaan sirf ek bacchee maanasi kaa ilaaj chal rahaa he
 "apart from the hospital, solar lights have been installed in Nagda and schools have been opened," says Shubhranshu, an official of the Tata Chromite plant, which is a link between the tribals, the administration and the hospital
 '' par lagata he, juang adivasee kisi tarah kii suvidha lene ko taiyaar nahin
 They are reluctant to leave the jungle and come down and get their children treated by the brokers
 sukinda block kaa pahari ilaaka kaliyapani khanan companiyon kii gatividhiyon kaa centre he
 From here, after reaching about 12 km through inaccessible forest and waterfalls, you can reach Nagda village on the Satkuian hill, which comes out of inaccessible paths
 nagada kii hakeekat jaanane ke liye pahaad par chadhaai shuru kii to adivaasiyon se jude tamaam sarkari pahaluon kaa khulaasa hone laga
 The rescue operation was being carried out from Debgaon under the mountain
 pahaad par saat kimi aage choti-si basti naliya dob aane-jane waalon ke liye padaav bani thi
 On reaching Nagda, two camps of the district administration are seen there
 yahaan sirf karmchaaree hi pahunch paae
 Collector S
 ke
 Malik returned exhausted as far as one km with subordinate officers
 camp sambhaal rahe panchayat adhikari dharmendra kumaar sahu bataate hai ki bacchon ko poshak tatv die ja rahe hai
 It was revealed from the camp itself that the Anganwadi worker warned the child development project officer Tilottama Mahapatra about this crisis four months ago through a report
 yah report, bakaul tilottama colector offis bhej di gai thi
 Malik says, "yes, there was a complaint of fever
 '' prashasan agar chaar maheene pehle alert ho jaataa to kam se kam darjan bhar bacchon kii jindagi bachaai ja sakati thi
 The National Human Rights Commission has also summoned a report from the Collector
 pahaad par tainaat sarkari mahakme ke log bataate hai ki afasar or netaa tata ke aspataal tak aate hai or chale jate hai
 Employees do real work
 khanij se bharpoor sukinda block main oemasi, infa, phekar, sarvabil, kamarda jaisi nau badi khanan companiyaan nagada ke ird-gird kaam kar rahi hai par tata ko chhodkar koi company maut ke bich jujh rahe adivasee bacchon kii madad ko aage nahin ai
 Children from all three settlements (upper, middle and lower) of Nagda village look like patients
 bada pet, sookhe haath-paanv, sharir ke anupaat se bada sir or sukhi sikudi twachaa cheekh-cheekh kar unke kuposhit hone kaa saboot detii he
 There are five relief camps in Nagda but the tribals are getting their benefits, there are no signs of this
 poochne par sarkari karmchaaree adivaasiyon ko koste hue kehete hai, ''ye log suvidha lene ko taiyaar nahin
 Officers do not come to the mountain, we are harassed
 ''is kuposhan kii vajah bal vivaah or maataaon kaa aswasth hona bataaya ja rahaa he
 Reduced fertility differences, malnutrition and superstition are also leading to the death of Juang Navihals
 chaaval or namak yaa phir junglee fal par nirbhar mahilaon ke liye swasth or surakshit maatrutiv ek sapana hi he
 a government official says that if there had not been a jump in the media, it would not have stood up
 yaheen ke nivasee desa kaa kahana he, ''ham log lakdi katkar bech lete hai
 Apart from this, rice and maize are grown
 '' adivasee suvidhaayen to chaahate hai par apana jangal-jameen nahin chhodia chaahate
 Dharmendra Sahu, the gram panchayat officer posted in the camp, says, "if these people come to live under the mountain, then the government is ready to give the house, education, healthcare, land lease everything under the Pakka Ghar scheme but it is not ready to take it 
 '' mausa prabhu pradhan kehete hai, ''jangal hamen contalu, pittalu, tunga, gaduva, mahua khaane ko detaa he
 Whether it is nutritious or not, what do we know? ”once a month, going 12 km down the mountain, bring his ration card rice in rupees
 pahaad par nagada, guiyansaal, aradapal, nataur, chungubipal, ragada, puragauda gaanv based hai par vahaan ke halaat bhi bahut achche nahin dikhte
 These villages have a population of about 7,500
 kareeb 1,409 ghar hai jinhen rashancard die gaye hai
 Lack of awareness is that they take the death of children lightly
 apane aath maah ke bete kabul ko kho chuke raabi juang kehete hai, ''ye bachche ishwar kii dein hai, usee ne diya, usee ne waapas le liya
 Sukinda MLA Pritiranjan Ghadai says that the road to Nagda has passed
 unki maane to vikaas or jaagrukta juang adivaasiyon kii jivan ghutti he
 According to the Rapid Survey on Children report, 46 percent of tribal children up to the age of 5 in the state are vulnerable to malnutrition
 maanak ke mutabik, bacchon ke vajan ke maamle main odisha desh main 16wein number par he
 Iron and folic acid supplements 39
 3 pratishat adivasee bacchon ko hi mil paati he
 Clearly, the state is extremely backward on the health standards of children and mothers
 sarkari laaparvaahee or logon main jaagrukta kii kami se sthiti or bhayaavah ho gai he
 If this is the case then God is the master of the naval

 There was no delay in capturing the statements of all BJP veterans Rahul Gandhi and Akhilesh Yadav, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 akhilesh yadav ke 'gadhaa' bayaan ko to piem modi ne chunavi sabhaaon main khub tool diya
 Actually, Akhilesh Yadav said in a rally during election campaign in Rae Bareli, 'A donkey's advertisement comes on TV
 main sadi ke mahanayake se apil karata hum ki vah gujarat ke gadhon kaa prachaar na karen
 This statement was delayed by Akhilesh's departure from Juban and then the entire clan of BJP came to dominate it
 akhilesh ke is bayaan kaa sabase pehle piem modi ne jawaab diya, unhone ise gujarat kii maati se jodate hue apane andaaj main kaha, 'gadhaa apane maalik kaa vafaadaar hota he
 No matter how sick the donkey is, hungry, tired, but if the owner takes work from it, then after tolerating everything, he keeps the work done by the owner
 yahi nahin, piem ne khud ko is kirdaar se jodate hue kaha, 'sava sau karod deshvasi mere maalik hai, wo mujhase kitna kaam lete hai, main karata hum, thak jaaun to bhi karata hum
 Because i take inspiration from the donkey with pride
 'darasal bollywood ke super star amitabh bachchan ne gujarat ke vanya gadhaa abhayaarany ke liye ek vigyaapan main najar aae the
 They tell about the sanctuary in it, about the donkeys and appeal to the people to go there and roam
 akhilesh ne is vigyaapan kaa zikr raibareli ke chunaav prachaar main kiya tha
 PM Modi began to raise this statement of Akhilesh in every election meeting, because the BJP strategists knew that this statement could outweigh Akhilesh and the electoral wind could be diverted
 akhilesh apane is bayaan ke is tarah se ghir gaye ki unhen jawaab dete nahin ban paa rahaa tha, wo is bayaan se peechha chhudaana chaahate the lekin bijepi ko to maano isi kaa intjaar tha, or usne ise cash karne main koi deree nahin kii
 Not only this, PM Modi also caught Rahul Gandhi on Akhilesh's 'donkey' statement
 unhone kaha ki upie sarkaar ne to gadhe se prerana lekar stamp tikat kar jari kiya he
 Further, connecting Gujarat's leaders with leaders like Gandhi and Sardar Patel, Modi said, 'where Akhilesh is talking about donkeys, that is the place where Gandhi, Sardar Patel was born, Krishna made him his work place
 'ab chunaav parinaam ke baad jaankaar to ye kehane lage hai ki akhilesh kaa 'gadhaa' bayaan bijepi ke liye sanjivani kaa kaam kar gaya or shuruaati charnon ke baad bijepi ne is bayaan ke saath-saath gathbandhan netaaon ke duusare bayanon par apana chunaav-prachaar kaa focus kar diya

 The days of Lalu Yadav are not doing well nowadays
 ek ke baad ek vivaad, har roj nae nae aarope, inakam tex ke chaape, parivaar ke logon ke jameen ghotaale main funsane ke maamle, kharaab swasthya or upar se nitish kumaar ke saath sambandhon main tanatani
 But Lalu Yadav wants to smoke every worry in his cool style
 bihar main aajkal har roj ek nayaa maamla saamne aa rahaa he jisamen yah baat pataa chalati he ki lalu yadav ko kisi na kisi ne apni jameen or ghar gift main de diya
 BJP alleges that it is not a gift but a matter of benami property and bribe
 susheel modi aae din press conference karke kehete hai ki lalu ne logon ko naukari dene ke badale kaam karaane ke badale or mantri banane ke badale jameen ke taur par rishwat lee
 But when Lalu Yadav was asked why everyone is giving him a gift on gift and land on land, Lalu Yadav said that if someone wants to give me his property in gift, then why are other people hurting is
 lalu kaa tark he ki gift dena gaiyr kanoonee bilkul nahin he
 When asked about the bjp's charge, Lalu is angry that the BJP people are beggars? Those people do not deserve to give any gift to them
 unka daawa he ki gift main jameen milane kaa aarope purana he or isaki kai baar jaanch ho chuki he, lekin sabit kuch bhi nahin ho sakaa
 Together they add that by trying to discredit people like Kanti Singh and Raghunath Jha by raising the issue of gifts
 buudhvaar ko lalu yadav raashtrapati chunaav ke bare main vipaksh kii baithak main shaamil hone ke liye dilli aae the
 After the meeting, Lalu said that before the BJP announces its candidate, then they will decide their next step
 lalu yadav ne chutki lete hue kaha ki modi ke guru adwani rahe hai, lekin unhen nahin lagata ki adwani ko guru dakshina milegi
 Lalu Yadav does not give a clear answer when asked whether Lalu will support him if Advani's name comes up, but he says that he will not compromise ideology at all about the President

 When Lalu Yadav was asked what kind of daughter-in-law he wanted, his answer was how should the daughter-in-law be able to run and run the house well
 lalu kehete hai ki yah bahut jaruri he ki ladkaa or ladki ek-duusare ko pasand ho lekin saath hi yah bhi kehete hai ki vah apane bacchon kiarange marij karnachahenge

 But as soon as he came out of the house, he showed why he is called the youtube King of Bhojpuri
 bataa den ki khesari laal yadav prasiddh bhojpuri gayak or abhinayta hai

 2012 main ai apni pehali film 'saajan chale sasuraal' se wo rato raat bhojpuri film jagat ke sitare ban gaye

 ek footpath par apane bachche ko janm dekar marane vaali mahila kii khabaron par sangyaan lete hue dilli ucch nyaayalay ne buudhvaar ko pradesh sarkaar ko shishu kii haalat ke bare main use puri jaankaree dene kaa aadesh diya he

 adaalat ne sarkaar se yah bhi bataane ke liye kaha ki jo mahila us shishu ko god lenaa chaah rahi thi, use us shishu ko god die jane ke bare main sarkaar kaa kya rukh he
 For the first time, a hundred years after a symbol that became part of the public political imagination of this nation, and 68 years after independence, today we are being told that we should eat Bharat Mata in a new way
 kisi bhi kism kii bahes yaa asahmati kii gunjaaish ke bagaiyr ab jabaki yah maang hamaare upar lagaataar thopi ja rahi he, vakt aa gaya he ki ham kuch sawaal puuchhen: masalan, mathrubhumi kii is mithkeey tasviir main aakhir koun he; yah tasviir kab or kaise astitv main ai; or aakhir kis sandarbh main is tasviir ne rashtrawaad ke sanghathak pratik kii siyaasi bhoomika akhriyaar kar lee? in sawaalon kaa tatkaal jawaab diya janaa hoga kyonki kisi raashtra kii ek stri-rup main pariklpana, chaahe vah inasaani ho yaa divine, na to kudarti he or na hi swayansiddh or beshak, yah shaashvat to katai nahin he
 Prosperous political paradox: The intangible secular ideal of this nation, which sought to depict an anthropomorphic image and etched its body on the map of the country, contained a rich political paradox in the process
 deviyon or devataaon se pati padi is dharti par is nai devi kaa aavirbhaav beesvin sadi ke aarambh main hota he jo khud apane liye ek jagah banaati he
 As popular images of the printed medium circulated, the motherland began to be shown on the map as a goddess
 isane hamaare bhugolic or prashasnic daawey ko nae sire se shuchita pradaan karne kaa kaam kiya
 The difference between her body and the map gradually faded, then Bharat Mata started collecting other national secular symbols around her like the tricolor and the Ashoka pillar
 kabhi-kabhi to yah mishrit paridrishy itnaa doordarshee ban padaa he ki isse aakarshith hue bina rah paanaa mushkil ho jaataa he
 For example, in 1962, a picture of Bharat Mata was published showing that the fragmented Ashoka Pillar is guarding some of the lions and Mata is protecting India's borders in the war with China
 sumati ramasvami ne apni pustak da godes and da neshnaru masping madar india main desh kii pariklpana kii prakriya main 'vaigyanik-bhugolic' or 'maanavarupi-paavan' tatwon ke is shashakt sammishran kaa zikr kiya he
 Due to this combination of secular and religious, this picture appeals so much and also proves its suitability as a symbol of a multi-religious nation
 iske baavjood is tasviir main paryaapt rup se spasht hindu dharmik vyanjanaon par kabhi koi andeh nahin rahaa he
 This symbol of Mother India spread on the shoulder of popular militant nationalism in the early decades of the twentieth century when the spirit of dedication had entered politics and a new divine image of the nation was being tried
 aupniveshik pratibandhon se bachane ke liye mithkeey tasviren upnivesh-virdohi inkulabi bhaawanaaon ko dhakne kaa ek naram aujaar thim, khaskar rakshas kaa vadh karti bhartiya devi kii tasviir
 Sandeep, the nationalist hero of Rabindranath Tagore's novel Ghare Byre, tells his girlfriend Bimala at the peak of the Swadeshi movement in Bengal, the picture of such a homeland, "the geography of this country is not absolute
" koi bhi ek maanchitr ke liye apana jivan daanv par nahin laga saktaa
 True patriotism will not emerge among our countrymen until they can envision a motherland — we have to give it the form of a goddess! ”in this way a woman became a goddess and the motherland was depicted with a picture of a goddess, Which emerges from the map of India and accepts the sacrifice of her martyred sons
 abanindranath tagore kii banaai ek tasviir main bharat mata ko dikhaaya gaya
 The figure was enlarged and put on a silk banner and raised to the tune of the indigenous movement of Kolkata, using the tune of Rabindranath Tagore's patriotic songs
 is chhavi kaa rajnatik istemaal sankshipt hi rahaa kyonki baad main kahin zyada sankhya main mudrit chhaviyon ne saarvajanik maanas se ise bedakhal kar daalaa
 Over a period of time, the picture was printed in such a large way that it appeared to be provocative — it had faces of various national heroes around the goddess, who were hanged, or shown Gandhi in her lap
 Gaya whose blood is seeping from the body
 yahaan un nayakon kii ek kaalpanik akashganga nirmit kar di gai jinhone rashtriya andolan ke itihaas ko uske sir ke bal khadaa kar diya tha
 Obviously, this symbol was uncomfortable for those who questioned the nation's gaudy, popular and mythical representations
 mathrubhumi ke aise hi nirupan ke chalate rabindranath tagore kaa saahitiyik patan shuru hua tha
 His hero Sandeep had inadvertently chosen such a symbol and he had no idea that emotional catharsis like worship of the nation could easily turn into politics of hatred and cynicism
 kya maanchitr or jhande ke nishaan ke mukaable raashtra ke nirupan kaa koi or zyada secular roopak sambhav tha? isaki ek sambhaavna kaa sanket hamen 1937 main mathrubhumi ke rup main maanchitr ke nirupan main miltaa he jisamen bharat mata tirangi sari pahane hue he, jisaki kinari par charakhe kii kadhai he or uski prishthbhumi main congress ke kai jhande, tapiyaan or rashtriya andolan ke netaa dikhaai de rahe hai
 a year before this, in 1936, Mahatma Gandhi unveiled a far more natural symbol of the nation at the Bharat Mata Mandir in Benares, showing a large map of the country lying on the floor rather than a human image
 is maanchitr ko hindu dharm ke garh banaras main nirmit karne kaa prayaas sachetan tha taaki desh kii simaaon ko hi apane aap main ek pratik ke taur par darshaya ja sake jiske bheetar sabhi dharmon, jatiyon or panthon ke logon kaa vaas hota ho
 Today we stand at the far end of the country's history, where we are forced to ask ourselves the question, why did this second hypothesis of the nation fail to live on the ground? After all, why was that special temple on the map of India forgotten and how it was replaced in public memory by a Hamnam temple of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad built in Haridwar after half a century? Amidst the tide of Hindutva nationalism in the eighties, the picture of Bharat Mata always printed in the printed medium was suddenly installed in a marble temple and established her dominion over the temple with a map of Benares
 is tarah hamen upnivesh virdohi rashtrawaad ke ateet se uthaakar rashtriyata ke maujuuda rajya-pryojit bahusankhyakwaadi itihaas main phenk diya gaya
 Today, the object of proving the loyalty of Mother India, we can say that the symbol of Mother India has completed its journey today
 kala ke itihaas kii jaankaar geeti sen iske bare main likhti hai ki is pratik ne kabhi desh ko ek raashtra ke rup main sangathit karne ke liye dharm kaa sahaara liya tha, aaj desh ko ek dharm ke tahat sangathit karne ke liye yah rashtrawaad kaa sahaara le rahaa he
 This change is full of irony
 angrejon ke jamaane main bharat mata kii tasviir chupchaap prem or apnaape kii cheez hua karti thi lekin aaj yah vafadari sabit karne kii vastu ban chuki he
 Today, new definitions of patriotism and citizenship are being coined under the pretext of this
 inamen sabase badi vidambnaa 'rajdroh' kaa vah kanoon he jo aupniveshik rajya kii viraasat he
 Before independence, treason was imposed on the mythological imagery of the motherland, the nation-state of today is using this law against every person who refuses to accept this symbol
 vibhaajan ke baad is raashtra ke khandit nakshe kii javabdehi kiski he? is chaak-chauband suraksha vaale raashtra-rajya main rahane kaa adhikaar kise ho jabaki apni bhugolinta par hone vaale sambhavit hamalon ko lekar vah lagaataar baichaiyn bhi he? jis tarah yahaan kisi ko bhi 'rashtrabhakt' se 'rashtravirohi' kabhi bhi tehraaya ja saktaa he, vaise hi is raashtra kaa jashn manaate-manaate dandbhav main phisal janaa bhi asann sthiti he
 Marhum artist Maqbool Fida Hussain was similarly valued for his right to represent the motherland — on the fiftieth anniversary of independence in 1997 he painted a map of India like an ardent youth with sketches of Ganesh and Gandhi, multi-storeyed Buildings were stretched and airplanes were flying; But in 2005, this image of the nation transformed into an outrageous, bloodied and naked figure
 mathrubhumi kii kshat-vikshat deh or uski dhad par un shaharon ke nishaan jahaan dange or narsanhaar hue—is tasviir ko ek 'muslim' kalakaar kii suniyojit harakat ke rup main dekha gaya jisane bharat mata ko nirvastr kar daalaa he
 After that, a series of intimidation started and Hussain was pushed into exile by Hindu right-wingers, from where he could never return
 mathrubhumi ne apane is vishisht naagarik ko usee tarah bedakhal kar diya jaise vah aaj har us naagarik ko karne ke liye dhamka rahi he jo uske pratik ko puri tarah khaarij karata he
 The symbol's past: In view of the current political debates on Mother India, Kolkata's Victoria Memorial Hall is going to bring out its own collection of modern art (ranging from Rabindranath Bharti Society) that gave birth to the symbol in many ways
 maheene kii kalakriti ke rup main pradarshit abanindranath tagore kii 1905 main banaai 'wash' painting mathrubhumi ko tyaag or mukti kii ek sanyasin kii akruti ke rup main pesh karti he
 While creating it, it was on the mind of the artist that for the first time he is creating an 'artistic' symbol for the nation of India which is neither religious nor political
 is akruti ke jariye kolkata ke swadeshi andolan main paisa jutaney kaa kaam liya gaya
 The political use of this image was brief

 If you are not bored, think of those students who went to the college without teachers for four years and did not get bored
 kya aapako lagata he ki aap ucch shiksha ko lekar sajag hone ja rahe hai, saadhaaran aamadani waalon ke liye ek baat bataanaa chahta hum
 Why this is happening, this is happening so that your children never get a good education

 Students and teachers may not meet each other, but you will always get the college building

 This shows that we love college icons

 Sampoornananda Sanskrit University
 is college kii sthapana 1791 main kii gai thi, iske shuru ke chaaron principal angrez hi the
 In 1958, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Sampurnanand gave the shape of the university
 is college kii imaarat dekhiegaa, aisa lagegaa aap banaras or kioto nahin, landan aa gaye hai
 There will be very few colleges whose buildings will be like this
 gothic style main bani is college kii imaarat main koi bada netaa nahin jayega kyonki jane se pehle bahut kaam karnaa hoga
 This building rests on its own till date, just as Sanskrit rests on its own till date
 aadhunik sanskrit shiksha kaa itihaas is college ke itihaas se shuru hota he
 It was approved by Lord Cornwallis in 1791 and was proposed by Jonathan Duncan of the East India Company
 pandit kashinath iske pehle shikshak hue the
 Doctor Valentin established the Anglo Sanskrit Department here
 whatsap uniwarsity ke mantri, netaa or unke samarthakon ke liye bataa duun ki ye wo vailemtine nahin hai jinka ve har 14 farvari ko virodh karte hai
 Dr
 aar tii es griphith iske pehle principal bane
 It was Griffith who translated the Balmiki Ramayana into English
 doctor ganga nath jha ke samay main bhi yahaan kaaphi kaam hua tha
 This building tells so much that even the beginning of Sanskrit education has started in a good way, now you will be happy to hear the story that this building is going to tell you, that even in the case of Sanskrit, your friends have not disappointed you
 sanskrit agar bhartiya maanas main raajnneetik bhavukta paidaa na karti to uske naam par ronaa bhi nahin rote, magar yah jaanate hue ve shapath grahan samaaroh ke samay zarur jataate hai ki shapath sanskrit main lee he
 When our colleague Ajay Singh went to the Sampurnanand Sanskrit College, the organization of all the important organs of the University was sitting there
 ajay singh kaa saamana ek parisar main, ek hi din main chaar dharne se hua
 It is indeed a matter of pride that one of the four pickets was about this matter, about which this series of prime time has been going on for several days
 adhyapakon kii kami va kakshaen na chalane se chaatro kaa bemiyadi dharna
 This slogan on the red banner won my heart
 pehali baar kahin to chaatr adhyapakon kii kami or kakshaen na chalane ke kilaaf bemiyadi dharne par baithe mili
 When the picket becomes indefinite, it should be taken serially
 chaatro ke haath main jo binar hai unke naare bataate hai ki chaatr bharat kii vyapak samasyaon se bhi jujh rahe hai jo unke vishvavidhyalay main chali ai he
 Liberation from brokers is India's eternal problem, the fighters of which have not yet been freed from this earth
 ye chaatr vanshavaad or kshetravaad jaisi mahamari kii samaapti kii bhi maang kar rahe hai
 Apart from appointing vacant posts, they are raising their banners demanding an investigation to spread anarchy
 chaatr shakti or raashtra shakti binar ke kone main likhaa he
 Hail to religion and destruction of unrighteousness
 chaatro main sadbhaavna ho or vishvavidhyalay kaa kalyaan ho
 Wishing welfare is an integral part of Sanskrit education
 chaatro ne apni loktantric shakti kaa istamaal kiya he, iske liye unhen badhai
 The problems of students are so different that different groups are also needed to raise them
 jise puri karne ke liye ek alag gut is tuuti hui sadak ke nirmaan kii maang kar rahaa he
 The road runs from the hostel to the central office of the university
 sadak kii haalat dekhakar dukhi hone kii zarurat nahin he, kyonki abhi aapako hastal kii haalat kaa bhi sadma bardaasht karnaa he
 a banner is demanding that road construction be done without delay
 vilamb jhelte jhelte hamaare chaatr avilamb ke sahare apane dhiraj kaa dilasa de rahe hai
 The hostels should be beautified and repaired with immediate effect
 bharat main prabhaav teen prakaar ke hote hai
 Effects, side effects and immediate effects
 ye chaatr chaatr sangh kaa chunaav bhi karaane kii maang kar rahe hai
 Two more dharnas are going on
 dharna pradarshan main agar aap nahin gaye, yaa nahin baithe to yakeen jaaniye aapane loktantric jivan to jiyaa hi nahin
 Employees' unions and professors are also sitting on the dharna here
 bharat kii sarkaar ko har saal demokrasi report jari kerani chahie jisamen bataaya jaae ki kis pradarshan ke baad karrwai hui, kis pradarshan kaa nateeja nahin niklaa or kis pradarshan kaa kabhi nateeja hi nahin nikalegaa
 Seeing the strike of the employees union and teachers also, Ajay Singh felt that even though the system has made this university sick, the effect of antibiotic of democracy is still remaining in the teachers here
 yahaan par chaatro kii tarah josh kam he, bujurg ho chuke hai or kaiyon ke paas kaala bag aa chukaa he
 When the black bag hangs on the shoulder, then the life of a government job has become successful
 umr ho gai he isliye bargad ke neeche aa gaye
 September salary is not received
 2010 se vidhyalay kaa grant nahin aayaa he
 Due to which no work is being done
 yahaan par har har mahadev kaa naaraa bhi lagata he
 Democratic struggles also get energy from Har Har Mahadev, but it is not that the slogan of Employee Unity Zindabad has disappeared
 sampoornanand sanskrit vishvavidhyalay kaa yogadan itnaa hi he ki usee kaa lihaaz kar sarkaron ne jeevandaan diya hua he, varna to lagata he ki ise band karne main koi kasar nahin chodi gai hogi
 The primary hospital within the university is closed, and there are agitations to get it started
 ab ham chalenge chatravaas kii taraf
 We want you to keep quiet a bit and you cry peacefully through the photographs without shedding tears
 ronaa bhi kai prakaar kaa hota he
 It would be appropriate to cry without tears at this time
 tasveeron main aapako shauchalay dikhegaa magar svachh bharat nahin dikhegaa
 There is no need to panic because the students have found a corner for Paan Peak
 kaaman room kii haalat vahi he jo aapaki hamaari he
 Regardless of the crumbling roof of the common room, the students are watching the news channel, you will love seeing it
 ki ham kuch kar bhale na paae
 Looking at Propaganda
 ye sab dekhne sunne ke baad kya aap ab yah bhi jaananaa chahenge ki sampoornanand sanskrit mahavidhyalay main kitne shikshak hai, kitne nahin hai
 There are 24 departments, 5 faculty
 vishyon or vibhaagon ke naam hai vyakaran, jyotish, sahitya,puraana, mimasaa, veydant, tulanaatmak dharm darshan, buddha darshan, jain darshan or paali
 For proper study of all these
 118 adhyaaapak hone chahie, magar 46 hi hai, 72 nahin hai
 The advertisement for restoration has come out, but the selection process is disputed
 sampoornanand sanskrit mahavidhyalay se sambandhit yaa manyataprapt bharat kaa koun sa aisa ilaaka hoga jahaan koi vidhyalay yaa college nahin hoga
 550 schools are affiliated to it
 manyata dene ke niyam saadhaaran hai
 One and a half acres of land, five to seven rooms be a library, playground if you can open a Sanskrit institute
 yah sab to banaras ke sampoornanand sanskrit mahavidlaay main 1791 se he, magar uski haalat aapane abhi dekhi
 Our entire series is on ndtv's website and Facebook page
 aap dekhie or dikhaaiye ki bharat ke naujavaanon ko barbaad karne kaa rashtriya project kis tarah se chal rahaa he

 sampoornanand sanskrit vishvavidhyalay
 The college was established in 1791, the first four principals were English
 1958 main uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri sampoornanand ne uniwarsity kaa rup de diya
 Look at the building of this college, it will look like you have come to London, not Banaras and Kyoto
 bahut kam college honge jinaki imaarat iske jaise hogi
 There will be no major leader in this Gothic style building of the college because a lot of work has to be done before leaving
 yah imaarat aaj tak apane dam par tiki hui he, jaise sanskrit apane dam par aaj tak tiki hui he
 The history of modern Sanskrit education begins with the history of this college
 1791 main lord cornwalis ne isaki manzuri di thi or prastaav tha east india company ke jonathan dancan kaa
 Pandit Kashinath was its first teacher
 doctor vailemtine ne yahaan angl sanskrit vibhaag kii sthapana kii thi

 If Sanskrit did not create political sentiment in the Indian psyche, they would not even cry in his name, but knowing that at the time of the swearing-in ceremony, they must express that the oath is taken in Sanskrit
 hamaare sahyogi ajay singh jab sampoornanand sanskrit mahavidhyalay gaye to vahaan vishwa vidhyalay ke sabhi mahatpavurna angon ke sanghathan dharne par baithe the
 Ajay Singh was confronted by four dharna in a campus, on the same day
 yah vaaki gaurav kii baat he ki chaar dharne main se ek dharna is baat ko lekar tha jis baat ko lekar prime time kii yah series kai dinon se chal rahi he
 Shortage of teachers and non-running of classes led to indefinite strike of students
 laal rang ke binar par is naare ne meraa dil jeet liya
 For the first time anywhere, the students were sitting on an indefinite strike against the shortage of teachers and not taking classes
 dharna jab bemiyadi ho jaae to use siriyasli lenaa hi chahie
 The slogans of the banners in the hands of the students show that the students are also grappling with the widespread problems of India which have come to their university
 dallalon se mukti bharat kii sanathan samasya he, jisase ladane vaale abhi tak is dharti se mukt nahin hue hai
 These students are also demanding the end of epidemics like dynasty and regionalism
 rikt padon par niyukti ke alaava araajaktaa failaane kii jaanch kii bhi maang inke binar uthaa rahe hai
 Written in the corner of the student power and national power banner

 There should be goodwill among the students and welfare of the university

 Congratulations to the students for their democratic power
 chaatro kii samasyaayein itani hai ki unhen uthaane ke liye alag alag guton kii bhi aavashyaktaa he
 To fulfill this, a different faction is demanding the construction of this broken road
 yah sadak chatravaas se uniwarsity ke kendriya karyaalay tak jaati he
 There is no need to be sad to see the condition of the road, because now you have to bear the brunt of the condition of the hostel
 ek binar maang kar rahaa he ki sadak nirmaan avilamb ho
 Facing delay, our students are giving comfort of their endurance without any delay
 chatravaason kii sundarikaran va marammat tatkaal prabhaav se kiya jaae
 There are three types of influence in India
 prabhaav, dushprabhav or tatkaal prabhaav
 These students are also demanding to conduct student union elections
 do or dharne chal rahe hai
 If you did not go in the sit-in demonstration, or do not sit, then know that you did not live a democratic life
 yahaan karmchaaree union or profasar bhi dharne par baithe hai
 The Government of India should issue a Democracy Report every year, stating which action took place after which demonstration, which demonstration did not yield results and which performance will never result
 karmchaaree union or shikshakon kaa bhi dharna chalate dekh ajay singh ko laga ki bhale hi system ne is uniwarsity ko biimaar kar diya ho magar loktantr ke antibiotic kaa asar ab bhi yahaan ke shikshakon main baaki he
 Like students here, the enthusiasm is less, the elderly are old and many have black bags
 kaala bag jab kandhe par latak jaae tab samajhie sarkari naukari kaa jivan safal ho gaya he
 i have come under the banyan since i am old
 sitambar maheene kaa vetan nahin mila he
 The school has not received a grant since 2010
 jiske kaaran koi kaam nahin ho paa rahaa he
 The slogan of every Mahadev is also chanted here
 loktantric sangharshon ko bhi urja har har mahadev se milti he, magar aisa nahin he ki karmchaaree ekta zindaabad ke naaron kaa vajood mit gaya he
 The contribution of Sampoornanand Sanskrit University is so much that the governments have been given life in respect of the same, otherwise it seems that no effort will be left to shut it down
 uniwarsity ke bheetar kaa praathmik aspataal band he, jise chaalu karaane ke liye andolan chal rahe hai
 Now we will go towards the hostel
 ham chaahate hai ki thodi dur chup rahe or aap shanti se tasveeron ke zarie bina aansu bahaae rote rahe
 Crying is also of many types
 bina aansu ke ronaa hi is vakt uchit rahegaa
 In the pictures you will see the toilet but not clean India
 isse ghabaarane kii zarurat nahin he ki kyonki chaatro ne paan kii peak ke liye ek konaa khoj liya he
 The condition of the common room is the same as yours
 kaaman room kii dhahati chat kii parvaah kiye bagair chaatr news channel dekh rahe hai, ise dekh kar aapako acha lagegaa
 That we might not be able to do anything
 propeganda dekh rahe hai
 After listening to all these, would you also like to know how many teachers are there in Sampurnanand Sanskrit College and how many are not
 yahaan 24 vibhaag hai, 5 sankaay hai
 The names of subjects and departments are Grammar, Astrology, Literature, Purana, Mimamsa, Vedanta, Comparative Religion, Buddhism, Jainism and Pali
 in sab kii uchit padhai ke liye
 There should be 118 teachers, but 46 are there, 72 are not
 bahaali kaa vigyaapan niklaa he, magar chayan prakriya par vivaad he
 Which region of India belonging to or affiliated with Sampoornand Sanskrit College will have no school or college? 550 vidhyalay isse sambhddha hai
 The rules for recognition are simple
 dedh acre zamin ho, paanch saat kamare ho librari ho, khel kaa maidan ho to aap sanskrit santhaan khol sakate hai
 All this is in the Sampurnanand Sanskrit Mahavidlaya of Banaras since 1791, but you have just seen its condition
 hamaari yah puri series enditivi kii website or fasebuk pej par he
 You see and show how the national project of ruining the youth of India is going on
 yahaan bhi niyuktiyon main dhaandhlee ke aarope lag rahe hai
 Sanskrit was another center of education, it will happen and it will happen
 
 
 bihar kaa darbhanga
 The beauty of this building itself could have been primed separately but it would be unfair with the Sanskrit education going on within it and the dreams of Maharaj Kameshwar Singh of Darbhanga who donated such a beautiful building to Sanskrit would be lost
 isliye imaarat kii murtiyon jhaadphanus par mohit mat ho jaaiyegaa, apane kaleje ko bachaakar rakhie, badahaal sanskrit ke haal par chirane ke kaam aayega
 Maharaj Kameshwar Singh of Darbhanga donated 37 bighas of land including Lakshmishwar Vilas Palace for the development of oriental learning
 isi imaarat main maharaj kaa darbar laga karata tha, unka janm bhi yaheen hua tha
 Special efforts were also made in 1961 by the then Chief Minister of Bihar Shri Krishna Singh and the immediate Governor Zaqir Hussain
 ashwamegh yajna ke ghode kii tarah bharat ke vishvavidhyalayon kii grading karne nikle NAAC ke kaaran hi imaarat ko rang diya gaya he
 Since then, b grade has been attained, more than 70 percent of the teachers posts are vacant here
 62 college or 14 intermidiet college iske tahat chalate hai
 Pali and Prakrit were to be studied here, but have stopped
 yahaan jo pandulepiyaan rakhi hai wo durlabh bhi hai or shandaar bhi hai
 There are 6000 Pandulipis

 With the permission of the Vice Chancellor

 aapako lagata he ki shiksha mantri log kaam karte honge
 Recently google the education ministers statement
 aapako shiksha par kam, netagiri par zyaada milegaa
 Sanskrit is being erased in the name of saving
 pramod gupta jab kameshwar vishvavidhyalay se maatr ek kilometre dur ek or college gaye to jo dekha wo aap dekh lijie
 You will earn more than a hundred pilgrimages

 us uniwarsity kaa chaatr shahar kaa saansad ho to use shatabdi varsh main bulaanaa chahie ki nahin chahie
 Jai Shah is the son of Amit Shah and a news website called The Wire has published reports in Hindi and English about his company
 shot gan unke maamle kii jaanch kii maang kar bijepi main apana long ran daanv par laga rahe hai
 Shatrughan Sinha never skipped in praising Nitish Kumar, so Nitish Kumar should have called at least a university alumnus
 raajnneeti main dua salaam kii jagah bachi rahe, baaki hasil ke naam par vahi milanaa he jo aap ucch shiksha kaa haal dekh rahe hai
 Our series on Sanskrit education is not yet complete
 itane saare khandhar hai ki kya kya dikhaaen kya kya chhipaaen
 If you are not bored, think of those students who went to the college without teachers for four years and did not get bored
 kya aapako lagata he ki aap ucch shiksha ko lekar sajag hone ja rahe hai, saadhaaran aamadani waalon ke liye ek baat bataanaa chahta hum
 Why this is happening, this is happening so that your children never get a good education
 aap isaki maang karenge to netaa aapako murti kii laagat or kabristaan kii chauhaddi ke masale main bhatka denge
 Shortage of teachers and non-running of classes led to indefinite strike of students
 laal rang ke binar par is naare ne meraa dil jeet liya
 For the first time anywhere, the students were sitting on an indefinite strike against the shortage of teachers and not taking classes
 dharna jab bemiyadi ho jaae to use siriyasli lenaa hi chahie
 The slogans of the banners in the hands of the students show that the students are also grappling with the widespread problems of India which have come to their university
 dallalon se mukti bharat kii sanathan samasya he, jisase ladane vaale abhi tak is dharti se mukt nahin hue hai
 These students are also demanding the end of epidemics like dynasty and regionalism
 rikt padon par niyukti ke alaava araajaktaa failaane kii jaanch kii bhi maang inke binar uthaa rahe hai
 Written in the corner of the student power and national power banner
 dharm kii jai ho or adharm kaa vinaash ho
 There should be goodwill among the students and welfare of the university
 kalyaan kii kaamana sanskrit shiksha kaa abhinn ang he
 Congratulations to the students for their democratic power
 chaatro kii samasyaayein itani hai ki unhen uthaane ke liye alag alag guton kii bhi aavashyaktaa he
 To fulfill this, a different faction is demanding the construction of this broken road
 yah sadak chatravaas se uniwarsity ke kendriya karyaalay tak jaati he
 There is no need to be sad to see the condition of the road, because now you have to bear the brunt of the condition of the hostel
 ek binar maang kar rahaa he ki sadak nirmaan avilamb ho
 Facing delay, our students are giving comfort of their endurance without any delay
 chatravaason kii sundarikaran va marammat tatkaal prabhaav se kiya jaae
 There are three types of influence in India
 prabhaav, dushprabhav or tatkaal prabhaav
 These students are also demanding to conduct student union elections
 do or dharne chal rahe hai
 If you did not go in the sit-in demonstration, or do not sit, then know that you did not live a democratic life
 yahaan karmchaaree union or profasar bhi dharne par baithe hai
 The Government of India should issue a Democracy Report every year, stating which action took place after which demonstration, which demonstration did not yield results and which performance will never result
 karmchaaree union or shikshakon kaa bhi dharna chalate dekh ajay singh ko laga ki bhale hi system ne is uniwarsity ko biimaar kar diya ho magar loktantr ke antibiotic kaa asar ab bhi yahaan ke shikshakon main baaki he
 Like students here, the enthusiasm is less, the elderly are old and many have black bags
 kaala bag jab kandhe par latak jaae tab samajhie sarkari naukari kaa jivan safal ho gaya he
 i have come under the banyan since i am old
 sitambar maheene kaa vetan nahin mila he
 The school has not received a grant since 2010
 jiske kaaran koi kaam nahin ho paa rahaa he
 The slogan of every Mahadev is also chanted here
 loktantric sangharshon ko bhi urja har har mahadev se milti he, magar aisa nahin he ki karmchaaree ekta zindaabad ke naaron kaa vajood mit gaya he
 The contribution of Sampoornanand Sanskrit University is so much that the governments have been given life in respect of the same, otherwise it seems that no effort will be left to shut it down
 uniwarsity ke bheetar kaa praathmik aspataal band he, jise chaalu karaane ke liye andolan chal rahe hai
 Now we will go towards the hostel
 ham chaahate hai ki thodi dur chup rahe or aap shanti se tasveeron ke zarie bina aansu bahaae rote rahe
 Crying is also of many types
 bina aansu ke ronaa hi is vakt uchit rahegaa
 In the pictures you will see the toilet but not clean India
 isse ghabaarane kii zarurat nahin he ki kyonki chaatro ne paan kii peak ke liye ek konaa khoj liya he
 The condition of the common room is the same as yours
 kaaman room kii dhahati chat kii parvaah kiye bagair chaatr news channel dekh rahe hai, ise dekh kar aapako acha lagegaa
 That we might not be able to do anything
 propeganda dekh rahe hai
 After listening to all these, would you also like to know how many teachers are there in Sampurnanand Sanskrit College and how many are not
 yahaan 24 vibhaag hai, 5 sankaay hai
 The names of subjects and departments are Grammar, Astrology, Literature, Purana, Mimamsa, Vedanta, Comparative Religion, Buddhism, Jainism and Pali
 in sab kii uchit padhai ke liye
 There should be 118 teachers, but 46 are there, 72 are not
 bahaali kaa vigyaapan niklaa he, magar chayan prakriya par vivaad he
 Which region of India belonging to or affiliated with Sampoornand Sanskrit College will have no school or college? 550 vidhyalay isse sambhddha hai
 The rules for recognition are simple
 dedh acre zamin ho, paanch saat kamare ho librari ho, khel kaa maidan ho to aap sanskrit santhaan khol sakate hai
 All this is in the Sampurnanand Sanskrit Mahavidlaya of Banaras since 1791, but you have just seen its condition
 hamaari yah puri series enditivi kii website or fasebuk pej par he
 You see and show how the national project of ruining the youth of India is going on
 yahaan bhi niyuktiyon main dhaandhlee ke aarope lag rahe hai
 Sanskrit was another center of education, it will happen and it will happen
 
 
 bihar kaa darbhanga
 The beauty of this building itself could have been primed separately but it would be unfair with the Sanskrit education going on within it and the dreams of Maharaj Kameshwar Singh of Darbhanga who donated such a beautiful building to Sanskrit would be lost
 isliye imaarat kii murtiyon jhaadphanus par mohit mat ho jaaiyegaa, apane kaleje ko bachaakar rakhie, badahaal sanskrit ke haal par chirane ke kaam aayega
 Maharaj Kameshwar Singh of Darbhanga donated 37 bighas of land including Lakshmishwar Vilas Palace for the development of oriental learning
 isi imaarat main maharaj kaa darbar laga karata tha, unka janm bhi yaheen hua tha
 Special efforts were also made in 1961 by the then Chief Minister of Bihar Shri Krishna Singh and the immediate Governor Zaqir Hussain
 ashwamegh yajna ke ghode kii tarah bharat ke vishvavidhyalayon kii grading karne nikle NAAC ke kaaran hi imaarat ko rang diya gaya he
 Since then, b grade has been attained, more than 70 percent of the teachers posts are vacant here
 62 college or 14 intermidiet college iske tahat chalate hai
 Pali and Prakrit were to be studied here, but have stopped
 yahaan jo pandulepiyaan rakhi hai wo durlabh bhi hai or shandaar bhi hai
 There are 6000 Pandulipis
 digitizeshan nahin hua he
 With the permission of the Vice Chancellor
 lakhon kitaaben hai yahaan
 The Vishwa Vidyalaya is a repository of irregularities, on which there should be an All India Essay Competition in which the biography of a dear leader of the current government should be given as a reward
 aapako lagata he ki shiksha mantri log kaam karte honge
 Recently google the education ministers statement
 aapako shiksha par kam, netagiri par zyaada milegaa
 Sanskrit is being erased in the name of saving
 pramod gupta jab kameshwar vishvavidhyalay se maatr ek kilometre dur ek or college gaye to jo dekha wo aap dekh lijie
 You will earn more than a hundred pilgrimages
 bhole baba kii tarah aap bhi vish kaa pyaalaa pi lijie
 Not only do the leaders drink poison, you are also drinking
 baharhaal
 
 
 You have now come to Darbhanga's Mohalla Harahi Pokhar West Sankat Mochan Dham
 sadak kinare chal rahaa chah kamaron ke is college kaa naam vidyanand mithila sanskrit mahavidhyalay
 Vidyanand ji donated land for this college, later his family members also captured some part of it
 mere hisaab se acha kiya
 The college building from outside is telling that taking oath in Lok Sabha in the name of Sanskrit does not benefit Sanskrit
 jab pramod ji pahunche to patrkaar ko aayaa dekh is chaatra ko kahin se bula laayaa gaya or class chaalu karaayaa gaya
 The good thing is that there are ten people in this college, including the principal and the teacher
 pramod ji ne chaatr upasthiti panjika kaa ek panna palata to koi chaatr kisi bhi din absent hi nahin dikhaa
 Attendance has its own glory in India
 aap ho na hon atendence lag jaae to koi sabit nahin kar saktaa he ki aap is duniya main hi nahin the
 This college was built in 1907, the building looks like it
 pehle iskaa naam maharani adhirani sanskrit mahavidhyalay tha magar ab ise rameshwar lata sanskrit mahavidhyay kar diya gaya he
 There are 7 teachers in the name of Shibhak while 10 should be there
 vyakaran sahitya, veda, jyotish, main koi praadhyaapak nahin he
 a teacher of ritual is also due to retire next month
 250 ke kareeb yahaan chaatr padhate hai
 Since 1983, the college has not been receiving contingency funds, due to which development has stalled
 karmchaariyon kii sankhya bhi do tak simat gai he
 There is an important information from Madhya Pradesh
 rajya ke sarkari sangeet evam lalit kala mahavidhyalayon ke liye atithi vidwaanon kii niyukti kaa vigyaapan aayaa he
 The visiting scholar calls the scholar who is a scholar but goes as a invited guest so that he can be banished after paying honorarium
 permanent na ho jaae
 The contract, guest, adhock must have felt bad to say, the Indian culture may have felt hostile to it, so the Permanent scholars of Madhya Pradesh took the noun of guest scholar whose specialty is adhawk
 is vigyaapan se pataa chalata he ki madhya pradesh main samskruti ke sanchaalan hetu samskruti sanchaalanalay bhi he
 After four months of the 2017-18 season, advertisements have been released for the remaining season so that the process of their selection can begin
 hamaare mulk prakriya yaa to shuru nahin hoti he, or jab shuru hoti he to khatm nahin hoti he
 You tell me that the session starts from July and if the Master comes by November, there will be a lot of studies
 aavedan kii antim tithi 24 oktober he
 400 rupees per day will be given for these virtuous works
 tippaniyan How do you feel the highest joke of higher education? On October 14, the centenary year of Patna University will be celebrated
 jiske liye pradhanmantri patna ja rahe hai
 We had told in the prime time series how bad Patna University has become
 manaane ke liye kuch he nahin lekin raajnneeti he
 We all knew in our student life that Shatrudhan Sinha has done wonders by going to Bombay then
 patna college kaa naam kar diya he
 If the student of that university is a city MP then he should be called in the centenary year or not
 jai shah amit shah ke bete hai or inaki company ke bare main da vir naam kii news website ne hindi or angrezi main report prakashit kii he
 Shot guns are putting their long-run stakes in the BJP demanding an inquiry into their case
 shatrughan sinha ne nitish kumaar kii tarif karne main kabhi nahin kanjusee kii, isliye nitish kumaar ko kam se kam uniwarsity ke purv chaatr ko to bulaanaa hi chahie tha
 Dua Salaam's place in politics is left, in the name of the rest, you have to meet what you are looking for in higher education
 sanskrit shiksha par hamaari series abhi puri nahin hui he
 There are so many ruins what to show what to hide
 aap bor to nahin ho rahe hai, sochie un chaatro kaa jo chaar chaar saal bagair shikshakon ke college gaye or bor nahin hue
 Do you think that you are going to be aware of higher education, i want to tell you one thing for ordinary people
 ye kyon ho rahaa he, ye isliye ho rahaa he taaki aapke bacchon ko kabhi acchhee shiksha na mili
 If you ask for it, then the leaders will mislead you about the cost of the statue and the boundary of the cemetery

 The Government of India should issue a Democracy Report every year, stating which action took place after which demonstration, which demonstration did not yield results and which performance will never result

 Looking at Propaganda
 ye sab dekhne sunne ke baad kya aap ab yah bhi jaananaa chahenge ki sampoornanand sanskrit mahavidhyalay main kitne shikshak hai, kitne nahin hai
 There are 24 departments, 5 faculty
 vishyon or vibhaagon ke naam hai vyakaran, jyotish, sahitya,puraana, mimasaa, veydant, tulanaatmak dharm darshan, buddha darshan, jain darshan or paali
 For proper study of all these
 118 adhyaaapak hone chahie, magar 46 hi hai, 72 nahin hai

 yah sab to banaras ke sampoornanand sanskrit mahavidlaay main 1791 se he, magar uski haalat aapane abhi dekhi
 Our entire series is on ndtv's website and Facebook page
 aap dekhie or dikhaaiye ki bharat ke naujavaanon ko barbaad karne kaa rashtriya project kis tarah se chal rahaa he
 Here too, there are allegations of rigging in appointments
 sanskrit shiksha kaa ek or centre rahaa tha, hoga hi or hoga bhi
 
 
 Darbhanga of Bihar

 Therefore, do not be fascinated by the idols of the building, keep your heart safe, it will be useful to rip Sanskrit

 62 colleges and 14 intermediate colleges run under it

 The name of this six-room college running along the road is Vidyanand Mithila Sanskrit College
 vidyanand ji ne is college ke liye zamin daan di thi baad main unke parivaar ke logon ne bhi iske kuch hisse par kabza kar liya
 Well done according to me
 baahar se college kii imaarat bataa rahi he ki sanskrit ke naam par loksabhaa main shapath lene se sanskrit kaa bhala nahin ho jaataa he
 When Pramod ji arrived, seeing the journalist, this student was called from somewhere and the class was started
 acchhee baat he ki is college main principal or shikshak milakar das log hai
 Pramod ji turned one page of the student attendance register, then no student was seen absent on any day
 bharat main atendence kii apni mahima he
 If you are not present, then no one can prove that you were not in this world
 1907 main yah college bana tha, imaarat to isaki thik lagati he
 Earlier it was named Maharani Adhirani Sanskrit College but now it has been renamed Rameshwar Lata Sanskrit Mahavidyaya
 yahaan par shibhak ke naam par 7 teacher hai jabaki 10 hone chahie
 There is no professor in grammar literature, Vedas, astrology
 karmkand ke bhi ek shikshak agle maheene ritair hone vaale hai
 Close to 250 students study here
 1983 ke baad se is mahavidhyalay ko contigency raashi nahin mil rahi he jiske kaaran vikaas ruk gaya he
 The number of employees has also been reduced to two
 madhya pradesh se ek mahatvapurn soochna he

 The beauty of this building itself could have been primed separately but it would be unfair with the Sanskrit education going on within it and the dreams of Maharaj Kameshwar Singh of Darbhanga who donated such a beautiful building to Sanskrit would be lost

 Maharaj Kameshwar Singh of Darbhanga donated 37 bighas of land including Lakshmishwar Vilas Palace for the development of oriental learning

 Congress President Shahul Gandhi has consistently targeted the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) in the same way as Hindu temples have increased in recent times
 gujarat vidhansabha chunaav mencongressko badhat mili, jabaki satta virdohi lahar ko dhata bataate hue karnataka main vah gathbandhan sarkaar banane main safal rahi
 During the election campaign in both these states, the Congress President kept going to the temple, which showed him the benefits of getting it
 dharmik sthalon par janaa aurahindutvvadisanghathanaresaisko niyamit taur par nishaanaa banaakar rahul gandhi sanathan dharm or kattar hindutv kaa antar rekhaankit kar dena chaahate hai
 Under this strategy, he is targeting the Sangh
 rahul ne landan main apane vaktavy main or isse pehle bhi kai baar kaha he ki sangh kii vichaardhaara bharat ke vichaar yani 'idia of india' ko vikhandit karne vaali he jabaki bhartiya samaaj apane dhaanche main bahultavaadi he
 The Congress's inclination can be seen towards soft Hindutva since the Antony Committee report came out
 iske alaava 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main or uske baad hue kai vidhansabha chunaavon main bijepi kii jeet ke baad se hi congress kii koshish he ki soft hindutv vaale voter ko aresas or bijepi se alag kar apni ore mila liya jaae
 Rahul Gandhi tried to say this at a program of the International Institute of Strategic Studies (IISS) in London
 unhone shuukravaar ko aresas kii tulana sunni islamic sanghathanmuslim brotherhudse kii
 He said that the RSS wants to capture every institution in India and change the nature of the country itself
 bataate chalem ki muslim brotherhud misr kaa sabase purana or sabase bada islamic sanghathan he jisaki sthapana 1928 main hasan al-banna ne kii thi
 One of the main objectives of the Muslim Brotherhood is to govern the country on the basis of Islamic law i
e
 Sharia
 arab deshon main sakriy is sanghathan par aatankwaad ko badhaava dene kaa bhi aarope lagata rahaa he
 In Egypt, this organization is currently declared illegal
 rahul gandhi lagaataar yah sandesh dena chaah rahe hai ki aresas desh ko apane adhinayakawadi vichaaron se sanchalit karnaa chahta he
 So he said in London, "we are struggling with an organization called RSS which wants to change the original form of India (nature of India)
" bharat main aisa koi doosraa sanghathan nahin he jo desh ke sansthaanon par kabja jamaana chahta ho
 "the Congress president said," What we are struggling with is a completely new idea
 yah aisa vichaar he jo arab jagat main muslim brotherhud ke rup main paaya jaataa he, or yah vichaar yah he ki ek khaas vichaar ko har santhaan ko sanchalit karnaa chahie, ek vichaar ko baaki sabhi vichaaron ko kuchal dena chahie
 "rahul gave some examples," you see the reaction of four judges of the Supreme Court who come out and say that they are not being allowed to work
 aap raghuram rajan (purv rigerv bank governor) or notebandi ke jatke ko dekhie
 You can see how the institutions of India are being broken down one by one
 is sabakaa jawaab diya janaa chahie, ek aisa jawaab jisamen ve sab shaamil hon jo bharat ne jo kuch hasil kiya he, uskaa mulya samajhate hon
 "rahul said that the decision of Kinotbandi was disregarded by one institution
 kuch hafte lage arthshaastriyon ko yah samajhane main ki kya hua he
 The Reserve Bank was not talked about, the Finance Minister did not know about it
 iskaa vichaar sidhe aresas se aayaa tha
 Rahul Gandhi is stating that the RSS wants to run the country through Manusmriti on the lines of Muslim Brotherhood, where women will be considered as second-class
 muslim brotherhud sharia ke shashan par jor detaa he
 In Berlin, Rahul Gandhi said that there is a difference of ideology between BJP and Congress, you will never see any woman in RSS
 ve log mahilaon ke saath bhedbhaav karte hai, lekin congress main ye aapako nahin dikhegaa
 This attack of Rahul has also had the expected effect, his attack is being overturned by both BJP and RSS
 bhaajapa ne kaha he ki rahul apane bayanon se videsh main bharat kii chhavi kharaab kar rahe hai
 The RSS has said after Rahul's allegations that religion means connecting everyone and not sharing, it serves to raise the society
 dharm kaa matlab bhaicharahe

 One thing is clear from this study of Google that a large amount of users ignore the password-related warnings and they have to suffer in many ways

 Let us know about Minister Jitendra Singh Tomar
 
 
 
 According to the affidavit given to the Election Commission, Jitendra Singh Tomar is 48 years old and a resident of JJ Colony Delhi
 unki ghoshit sampatti bhi ek karod se bhi zyada kii he
 They also have two cars, as well as nine bank accounts mentioned in affidavit
 yah pehle congress party ke saath rah chuke he par pehla chunaav aam aadmi party ke tikat par dilli ke trinagar vidhansabha nirvachan kshetra se 2013 main ladaa par haar gaye
 After that he won elections from Trinagar in Delhi elections held this year and became law minister in Kejriwal government
 par unako dilli ke paryaton, kala or samskruti kii bhi jimmedaari de raakhi gayi he
 Now the matter of the minister's degree: Jitendra has written only 'tilak Manjhi, Bhagalpur University, Bihar' in the education column in the affidavit
 or sara vivaad unki is el el bi kii degree ko lekar hi he
 In April, quoting an RTI revealed that his degree is bogus
 thik ek din baad bhagalpur uniwarsity ne dilli hoicourt ko bataaya ki jo panjikaran number unki degree par he us number par koi or panjikrut he
 The degree is completely wrong and bogus
 unke khilaaf maamla tab or majboot hota dikhataa he jab wo ek english akhbaar ko ek bayaan dete he ki unke paas choudhary charan singh uniwarsity, meerut se vakaalat kii vaid degree he
 When the minister had a valid degree of Chaudhary Charan Singh University, what was the need to write Bhagalpur University in affidavit? It would have been better if the matter had ended here
 mantri ke paas avadh uniwarsity ke kantaprasad sundarlal saket pi ji college, ayodhya se bachaler of science kii bhi degree he
 The institute says the minister's mark sheet of the second year is incorrect

 With this, he has said that the options for canceling the license of the power companies which do not provide better facilities are also open
 shila dikshit ne kaha ki katautee ko lekar ek bijli company ke management ko saaf taur par chetavanee de di gai he ki unki sevaayen kaaphi kharaab hai
 In a meeting with the power companies, Sheela Dixit handed over the list of cut-off times to the power companies in many areas of the capital
 unhone kaha ki jin takneekee kharabiyon se katautee ho rahi he use tatkaal dur karnaa chahie
 Meanwhile, in a program organized in the capital, Sheela Dixit said that the Bawana plant was prepared to overcome the power crisis, but due to shortage of gas, this 1500 MW plant is not proving effective
 unke mutabik bamnauli plant is vajah se shuru nahin kiya ja sakaa kyonki gas kaaphi mahangi ho chuki he
 CM said that with the help of Haryana, arrangements were made to take power from a 700 MW coal-based plant in Jhajjar, but it would be very expensive as the cost of production increased
 unhone kaha ki upi main bijli kii daren 50 fisadi mahangi ho gai hai
 Despite this, this news was not discussed in the media, but there is a hue and cry in Delhi when electricity rates rise only slightly
 gauratlab he ki dilli kii mukhyamantrishila dikshitne kuch din pehle aasmaan choote bijli ke bill par ajeebogareeb bayaan diya tha
 Sheila Dixit said that if a family feels that the electricity bill is out of my income and i cannot pay it, then please light a bulb instead of two, do not drive the cooler, do not drive the fan, do not run the refrigerator or Never stop it
 unhone kaha ki tivi 24 ghante naa chalaao, kabhi-kabhi chalaao

 duniyabar main isa messiah ke janm diwas ke rup main har saal 25 disambar ko christmas de manaaya jaataa he
 People of the Christian community consider Jesus the son of God
 ye isai dharm ke logon ke liye sabase bada tyohaar hota he
 But do you know that in many countries the Christmas festival is celebrated on different days
 ji haa, kuch deshon main 25 disambar ke din christmas kaa tyohaar manaaya jaataa he, jabaki kuch roodhiwaadee desh (orthodox Countries) 7 janvari ko christmas kaa jashn manaate hai
 Let's know why
 
 
 darasal, aisa gregorian calendar (gregorian Calendar) or julian calendar (julian Calendar) main fark kii vajah se hota he
 People from the West follow the Gregorian calendar
 ye calendar pope gregory (pope Gregory) ne san 1582 main shuru kiya tha
 However, some Middle Easterners still follow the Julian calendar
 ye calendar 45 BC main julius sijar (julius Caesar) ne shuru kiya tha
 Let me tell you, the Julian calendar was followed before the Gregorian calendar
 is calendar ke hisaab se christmas de 7 janvari ko manaaya jaataa he, jise old christmas de (old Christmas day) kehete hai
 In the year 1752, England began to follow Gregorian calendar under the Julian calendar
 lekin kai logon ne nae calendar ko nahin mana or ve apane puraane julian calendar hi follow karte rahe
 There is a difference of 13 days in both calendars
 jiske hisaab se alag-alag calendar ko follow karne vaale log alag-alag din christmas de manaate hai
 View this post on Instagram 40pm PST - Which countries celebrate Christmas on 7 January? 39% of the world's population is presently in Russia
 inamen se lagbhag 85 fisadi log christmas kaa tyohaar disambar ke bajaae janvari main manaate hai
 But some Orthodox countries like Greece, Romania started celebrating Christmas from 1923 to 25 December
 jabaki, rus, ukraine, isroyal,egyptor bulgaria aadi deshon main christmas kaa tyohaar janvari ke maheene main hi manaaya jaataa he
 Apart from this, Christmas festival is celebrated on 7 January in countries like Serbia, Belarus, Montenegro, Kazakhstan, Macedonia, Ethiopia, Giorgia etc

 Arun Jaitley stopped me while strolling in Lodhi Gardens the next morning after hearing the Supreme Court verdict on October 13 in the gift accident case which reduced the compensation of the victims
 unhone kaha, ''is faisle main nyaay die jane kaa abhas bhi nahin he
 
 
 Where was the need to reduce compensation in the case which has put the conscience of the court as well as the entire country
 '' hakeekat yah haih nyaayik pendulum ek chor se aakhri chor tak ja saktaa he
 In November 2009, a year before the judgment in the case was reserved, an accused filed a bail application on the grounds that when the owners have been granted bail by the High Court, they should also get bail
 tab supreme court ne kaaphi naaraazgi dikhaai thi, kyonki maalikon par dastavejon ke saath chhedchhad karne kaa ek or maamla chal rahaa tha
 He immediately issued a bail cancellation notice and sent them back to jail
 is tarah naaraazgi kii seemaa, yaa isaki kami, aam taur par nyaayadhishon kii peeth par nirbhar karti he
 Now see how this pendulum has been swinging in terms of compensation
 uphaar haadase ke maamle main hycourt ne 2003 main 20 saal se upar kii umr vaale har peedit ke kareebi rishtedaar ko 18 lakh ru
 And Rs 10 lakh to a close relative of the victim under 20 years of age
 kaa muaavja dene kaa faisla sunaaya tha
 The Supreme Court, in its latest judgment, reduced the compensation amount of a victim above the age of 20 to Rs 10 lakh
 or 20 saal se kam umr vaale peedit ke muaavje kii rakam ghataakar 7
 5 lakhs
 kar di
 Now compare it to former Supreme Court Judge Justice P

 One is a matter of just 15 seconds of error and the other is the death of 59 people
 ek main laaparvaahee baratane kaa maamla he to duusare main kuch vyapaariyon ke laalach ke kaaran logon kii maut kaa
 Mistakes can be rectified by apologizing to one
 lekin duusare main maare gaye logon kii jindagi koi bhi waapas nahin laa saktaa
 One is about damage to reputation for a while, while the other is about accountability to public law
 ek main faisla teen saal se kam samay main aa gaya, to duusare main 15 saal kii deree hui or aakhirkaar jab faisla aayaa to mumkin he, kuch peediton ke rishtedaaron ko pehle mil chukaa apana kuch muaavja waapas lautaanaa pad jaae
 It is the right of the people to get instant justice in the constitution
 lekin supreme court main saat saal se adhik samay kii deree hui, jisamen faisla surakshit rakhane ke baad do saal use sunaane main lag gaye
 The reason for the reduction of the compensation amount has been given by the Supreme Court that the High Court did not revoke the postponement granted on June 26, 1983 for the suspension of the cinema hall license for four days, and in July 1989 when the same When another incident of fire broke out in the cinema hall, the license issuing department demanded the cancellation of the postponement, but instead of canceling the postponement, it ordered the DCP of licensing to examine the hall Cookies
 haadase main marane waalon ke kareebi rishtedaaron kii pidaa yah he ki unke apane priyajan, jo, 'licenseshuda' cinema haul main film dekhne gaye the, laashon ke rup main unhen mili
 Everyone knows how painful death from poisonous gas is
 zyaadaatar ko cinema haul kii balcony yaa neeche haul se behoshee yaa mrit avasthaa main nikaala gaya
 Their exit doors were closed because of a special box made for the owner to see
 is tarah ke box kii (gaiyr-kanoonee) ijaajat license vibhaag ke disipi se lee gai thi
 As a result, the stairs to the east were also closed
 jin logon ne apane priyajanon ko khoyaa, unke liye iskaa koi matlab nahin he, chaahe iske liye e, bi, si koi bhi jimmedaar ho
 The violation of public safety rules and procedures for 13 years, in which there is connivance with the officials who get salaries from public money, is clearly visible
 supreme court ne un par koi mudda nahin uthaaya he
 Long ago in 1983, the Supreme Court said that the precedent setting compensation could serve the essential purpose of justifying the power of law
 adaalat agar aisa muaavja nahin detii to yah moulik adhikaron, jo jivan or aazaadee kaa adhikaar dete hai, ke prati sirf jabaani sahanubhuti dikhaanaa he
 The way to prevent this violation is to impose an economic penalty that becomes precedent
 1983 main justise chandrachud ne kaha tha, ''agar is desh main sabhyataa ko nasht nahin hone dena he, jaisaa ki duusare deshon main nasht ho chuki he, to sarkaar ko nuksaan kii bharpai kerani hi hogi
 Tulsi is the senior advocate of the Supreme Court and the Deputy Chairman of the Law Commission of India
 chhattisgarh main pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa gram swachhata abhiyaan graminon par baari pad rahaa he
 The collectors of the districts are pressurizing the administrative machinery to make the villages of their areas completely open defecation free villages
 apane gharon main toilet banane ke liye graminon ko har tarah se majaboor kar diya gaya he
 Villagers are traveling around government offices, they were also assured of immediate financial assistance with government assistance
 lekin sarkari record main gharon ke odief ghoshit hone ke baad afasaron ne gaanv me palat kar nahin dekha
 Due to this, many villagers have to take loans, pay cement, sand and laborers
 kai gramin karjadaar ho gaye hai or wo bhugtan ke liye sarkari daftaron ke chakkar kaat rahe hai
 On the other hand, the government claims that the state government has so far 751 under the Swachh Bharat Mission
 25 karod rupee kharch kar chuki he
 With this amount, four districts, fifty six development blocks, six thousand gram panchayats and about eleven thousand villages have become free from open defecation
 lekin wo koun se chaar jile hai jo puri tarah se khule menshauch se muktahue hai
 There is no record of this with the Rural and Panchayat Department
 toilet banavaane ke liye liya karbehaal yah he ki chhattisgarh ke saikadon gaanv main in dinon sarkari afasar graminon par dabaav daalkar unke gharon mentoilet banawaarahe hai
 They are also being assured to sanction financial assistance under the government scheme
 lekin kaha ja rahaa he ki yah rakam unhen tab di jaaegi jab toilet ban jaaen or wo uskaa istemaal karnaa shuru kar den
 The villagers got the toilet constructed as per the intention of the government
 lekin unke gaanv ko odief kaa pramaan patr hasil hone ke baad sarkari afasar gaanv se nadaarad ho ja rahe hai
 As a result, the villagers are becoming indebted
 graminon ko aarthik sahaayta ke liye sarkari daftaron kaa chakkar lagaana pad rahaa he
 Even after months, they are not getting government assistance
 karj nahin chukaa paa rahe gramodief ke liye sarkaar ne apnegharon main toilet banaanevaale graminon ko 12 hajaar kii rakam sweekrut kii he
 But the villagers are dying to get this amount
 sarkari rakam samay par nahin milane ke kaaran unhen udhaar lekar toilet nirmaan karne vaale thekedaaron ko nagad bhugtan karnaa pad rahaa he
 In a village with a population of 2000 in Janjgir Chapa district, there are about 817 such families who have built toilets by taking loans and now they have to worry about repayment of debt
 karj kii adaayagi ke liye kai graminon ne apni jameen tak bech daali he
 Out of the 27 districts of the state, there is no such district where the villagers have been given the money to build the toilet completely
 zyaadaatar gaanv main dastak dete hi gramin bhugtan naa hone kii shikaayat karte najar aa rahe hai
 On the other hand, from April 1, 2016 to January 28, 2017, 218 villages in Chhattisgarh have become completely open defecation free
 jabaki 1126 gaanv khule main shouchamukt hone kii kagaar par hai
 It is expected that all these villages will complete their target before 31 March
 jila colectoron ke bich is baat kii hode machi he ki unke jilon main adhik se adhik gaanv odief qaraar de die jaaen
 For this, the government machinery has been completely dumped
 gram panchayaton se lekar nagareey nikaayon ke afasaron kii duty lagaayee gai he
 Apart from this, the Tehsildar, Sub Divisional Magistrate and Additional Collectors have been entrusted with the task of looking after the works
 lekin samay par sarkari yojana ke tahat toilet nirmaan ke kharch ke bhugtan ke liye sarkari mahakama taal rahaa he
 The villagers are narrating their own tragedy to the Chief Minister of the state Raman Singh, who is coming to take stock of the progress and development of government schemes in rural areas
 kai graminon ne to toilet banane ko lekar hai tauba machaani shuru kar di he
 He is sometimes citing his weak economic condition and sometimes is adamant about not taking loans

 ”LIVE: loksabhaa main bole grih mantri- canapati par bandook rakh faruk abdulla ko baahar nahin laa sakaterashtriya hit ke muddon par raajnneetik dalon main sarvasammati kii jarurat jataate hue mamata ne kaha, “ye sandesh puure desh main janaa chahie ki ham apni mathrubhumi or usase judi chizon ko pyaar karte hai
 We stand together ham shantipurna baatcheet or samaadhaan chaahate hai
 In such a situation, there should be no political noise or pollution
 ”tiemasi pramukh ne aage kaha, “sanvidhanik or vidhik taur par ye naa to prashansa yogya he or naa hi loktantric
 He should have discussed this with all political parties
 kashmir ke sthaneey logon se bhi baat kerani chahie thi
 They should have called a meeting in Kashmir, we were ready to go there
 ”mamata ne kashmir ke logon ko vishwaas main lene kii jarurat bataai
 Mamta said, “as citizens of the country, we are all patriotic people and love our motherland
 main majbootee se maanati hum ki kashmiri log hamaare bhai or bahan hai
 i urge and appeal to the government not to let them feel isolated
 unhen laganaa chahie ki wo desh ke saath hai or bhartiya hai
 We should build confidence in people that no one should feel intimidated
 ”mamata ne jammu or kashmir ke do purv mukhyamantriyon- mahabuuba mufti or umr abdulla kii tatkaal rihaai kii maang kii
 Mamta said, 'we are all together
 main samajhati hum ki mahabuuba, umr or anya raajnneetik hastiyaan aatankwaadi nahin hai, unhen loktantric santhaan or logon ke hit main reeha kiya janaa chahie
 ' uri main aatanki hamale ke baad centre sarkaar par pakistan se badla lene kaa dabaav badhane laga he
 India also has ways to respond to Pakistan's provocative actions
 lekin padosi mulk par hamalaa karne se pehle tamaam pahaluon par gaur karnaa hoga
 The issue has been highlighted in detail in the India Today 5 October 2016 issue
 sankat kii is ghadi main piem narendra modi ne faisla kar liya he ki 19 javaanon kii shahadat kaa badla pakistan se kaise liya janaa he jisaki jameen par pal rahe aatankwaadi aae din seemapar kar ghuste hai or aatank failaate hai
 In such a situation, India has these options to teach Pakistan a lesson: 1
 cowart oparationais oparation ke nishane parjaish-e-mohammadka chif moulana masood ajahar he jo 2001 main bhartiya sansad par hue hamale or 2016 main pathankot airbase par hue aatanki hamale kaa mastermind he
 Indian intelligence agencies have received reports that Azhar is going to Karachi from Bahawalpur to attend a gathering
 ro ke afasar afghanistan border jaakar vahaan jaish pramukh par hamale ke liye taiyaari kar sakate hai
 Baluchi separatists can be sought to carry out this operation
 2
 Surgical Strike India has the option to carry out surgical strikes to kill the terrorists
 aisa hi hamalaa america ne osama bin laden ko maarane ke liye pakistan ke abtabad main kiya tha
 There are training camps of lashkar-e-taiba and jaish-e-muhammad in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (pok)
 inhen tabah karne ke liye aise hamale kiye ja sakate hai
 3
 seemaa main ghuskar hamalabhartiya sena sarhad se sate pakistani sena kii un chaukiyon kii pahchaan kar sakate hai, jahaan se aatankwaadiyon ko bharat main ghuspaith ke liye bheja jaataa he
 In such a situation, armed with the equipment of the Indian Army, they can launch heavy fire at those posts
 in chaukiyon par army ke commando red daal sakate hai
 4
 trade warbharat pakistan ko vyapaar ke morche par bhi patkhni de saktaa he
 Most favored nation given to Pakistan in 2012 may be withdrawn
 dubai ke rastebharat or pakistanke bich hone vaale 4
 a $ 71 billion trade may be banned
 bharat aayaat kiye jane vaale pakistani saamaanon par tex badhaayaa ja saktaa he
 5
 kootneeti ke morche parabharat ko baluchistan ke algaavvaadi netaaon ko bharat main sharan deni chahie
 The Baloch Mission should be established in New Delhi
 antarrashtriya manch par pakistan ko gherne kii koshish kii jaani chahie
 Preference should be given to groups such as BIMSTEC on SAARC, which are not members of Pakistan
 6
 Strengthening Homeland Security In order to bring Pakistan to its knees, it is imperative that we strengthen our internal security
 uri hamalaa ho yaa pathankot hamalaa, aatanrik suraksha ke morche par hamaari kamajori saamne aa gai he
 It is clear from these incidents that we have failed to protect our military bases
 agarbharatakadai se jawaab detaa he to aatankwaadi iske badale main suraksha thikaanon par phir se nishaanaa bana sakate hai, aise main hamen apane servilans or khufia tantra ko or majboot karne kii jarurat he

 a week before the budget is presented, the government has cut the interest rate on small savings schemes by 10 basis points
 yani public provident fund, kisaan vikaas patr, sukanya samruddhi yojana, post offis main saavadhi jamaa samet vibhinn choti bachat yojanaon par july se sitambar timahi ke dauraan milane vaala byaaj kam ho jayega

 byaaj daron main is katautee ke peeche mukhya vajah bainkon par karj sasta karne kaa dawaab he
 Even after three cuts in policy rates from the Reserve Bank, banks were not able to cut the rate of debt significantly
 isaki vajah bainkon ke duube hue karj ke kaaran khastahal balanceshit he
 The only option to overcome the merger of the deepening recession in the economy is to see the government increasing consumption
 karj sasta hone par khapat bad sakati he
 The biggest source of fund raising for lending to banks is the savings of the general public
 choti bachat yojanaon par byaaj dar kam hone ke baad bank bhi apane saavadhi jamaa par byaaj daren kam kar paaenge
 For example, fds ranging from 1 year to three or five years
 isse bainkon ke liye fund kii laagat kam hogi or karj dene kii dar ghataane kaa bhi rasta khulegaa
 But the thing to note here is that at a time when the savings are at the low level of two decades, how effective the government's move to reduce the rate of return on savings will prove to be
 sarkaar kaa yah kadam logon ko bachat ke vibhinn vikalpon ke prati hatotsahit karegaa

 Another important point has also come to light that the Chief Advisory Committee (CAC) of Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly and VVS Laxman also did not directly approve the extension of Kumble's tenure
 is puure prakaran ke dauraan landan main maujuud rahe bisisiai ke ek varisht adhikari ne pitiai se kaha, 'reporton main kaha gaya he ki siesi ne kumble kaa kaarykaal badhaane ke liye kaha he

 rajya ke shiksha vibhaag ne isaki kavayad shuru kar di he or un skulon kii suchi maangi he jinke naam main 'harijan' shabd aata he
 The state's Director of Secondary Education has sent a letter to all the Chief District Education Officers and ex-officio District Project Coordinators of Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan
 isamen adhikariyon se kaha gaya he ki ve apane adhinsth sanchalit aise rajkeey vidyalayon ke naam sanshodhan ke prastaav gelevaar samekit kar bhejein taaki samekit prastaav sweekruti ke liye aage sarkaar ko bhijwaaye ja saken
 Director of Secondary Education Nathmal Didel told 'bhasha' that in writing a letter to all the Chief District Education Officers of the state and coordinators of the District Composite Education Campaign, such proposals have been sought that how many such schools are there in the name 'harijan' Has been used
 isamen naam parivartan ke liye sarkaar apni sweekruti pradaan karegi
 The government gives approval to amend a name
 ambedkar shiksha sadan samiti lunkarnsar sahit kuch sansthaaon ne sarkari skulon ke naam main harijan shabd ke istemaal par aapatti jataate hue ise hataane kii maang kii thi
 These institutions have termed the use of the word 'harijan' as unconstitutional
 didel ne bataaya ki sriganganagar main ek vidhyalay kaa naam rajkeey ucch madhyamik vidhyalay, harijan basti (sriganganagar) likhaa hua he
 After receiving a memorandum to change the name of this school, we have issued a circular for the Chief District Education Officers and ex-officio District Project Coordinators
 adhikariyon se kaha gaya he ki kisi bhi jile main aisa koi skool he to iske sambandh main jaankaree den
 He informed that whether the name of such state schools should be changed or not, a proposal will be sent to the government from the Director of Secondary Education and the government will take a decision on it
 unhone kaha ki rajya main mere dhyaan main aisa koi skool nahin he jinke naam main 'harijan' shabd kaa prayog kiya gaya he
 Generally, the name of state schools is associated with the name of a great person, freedom fighter or a martyr in the country, but people object to the use of the word 'harijan' in their address along with the name of the school
 ambedkar shiksha sadan samiti bikaner kii ore se 11 sitambar ko bheje gaye gyaapan ke anusaar rajya kshetra main aise kai rajkeey vidhyalay aise he jinke saath harijan basti / harijan mohalla kaa ullekh kiya gaya he
 The memorandum states that the word 'harijan' is not a constitutional word
 yah dalit samaaj ke maan sammaan ke virudv he tathaa is varg ke logon main hinabhaavna paidaa karata he
 In a letter written to the Chief District Education Officers, it has been told that since the word 'harijan' is not constitutional, it is necessary to remove the word 'harijan' from the names / addresses of such state schools
 inamen aise rajkeey madhyamik / rajkeey ucch madhyamik vidhyalay jo harijan basti / harijan mohalla naam se sanchalit he yaa aise bhi rajkeey vidhyalay sanchalit ho sakate he jinke naam ke saath 'harijan' shabd judaa he

 This is seen in the case of Kuril
 lokayukta ko kuril kii sari jaankaree kisi or ne nahin balki unheen ke saale anil arya ne di thi
 It is said that Kuril got his brother-in-law in a company, but later Anil was removed from the job due to a rift between the two
 is baat ko lekar anil unase naaraaz tha or yahi naaraazgi kuril ke liye buree sabit hui
 Similarly, on May 15, when the residence of IPS officer Mayank Jain was raided, the factionalism between Jain and other officials was cited as the reason

 They also have crores of rupees
 kii avaidh sampatti hone kaa daawa kiya ja rahaa he
 An officer of the Lokayukta police, on the condition of anonymity, said, "in most cases, it is seen that close to the accused complain about mutual jealousy
" kareebi hone kii vajah se unhen puri jaankaree hoti he ki aaropee kaise bhrashtachar kar rahaa he or usne kahaan-kahaan nivesh kar rakhaa he
 This gives us information about the accused and we conduct raids
 "most of the cases that reach the Lokayukta office are like this
 kuch hi maamalon main jaankaree hasil hone par bahari vyakti lokayukta se shikaayat karte hai
 An investigating officer says that the information comes to him
 aam taur par shikaayat karne vaala bhrashtachari ke khilaaf saboot bhi de detaa he
 The State Lokayukta has taken many big actions against officers and employees posted in the state in the last few years
 kuch maamle aise rahe hai jisamen lokayukta police ko adhikari ke ghar se arabon ru
 Property information up to lokayukta ke chaape kii kai karravaayiyon main hissaa le chuke ek inspector bataate hai, ‘‘kisi vyakti ke bare main shikaayat milane ke baad jab lokayukta sahab hamen jaanch ke liye kehete hai to ham gupt rup se us aaropee ke bare main sabhi jaankariyaan ikattha karte hai
 We do not let anyone know what we are doing about that person
 ’’ ve bataate hai ki kai baar to shikaayat karne vaala hi sampatti kii jaankaree or uske saboot de detaa he
 If he is not able to give evidence, then we have to collect all the papers so that the necessary documents can be presented as evidence in the court
 lokayukta sanghathan do maamalon main karrwai karata haih pehla pad ke durupyog kaa maamla ho yaa phir bhrashtachar kaa
 When a complaint comes to the Lokayukta, they order an inquiry into it
 inspector str kaa adhikari uske baad apane str se sampatti kii jaankaree ikattha karata he
 It is ascertained how much of the assets of the accused and his salary during his stay in the job, so that it can be known whether the assets earned are more than his salary
 yah pataa chalate hi ki aaropee ne apane pad kaa durupyog karte hue sampatti arjeet kii he, lokayukta ke aadesh ke baad vibhaag ke espi ke netritv main chaape kii karrwai kii jaati he
 The purpose of taking action early in the morning is that the person against whom action is being taken, should meet at home and not get a chance to run around
 lokayukta police ke kaaryvahak diji ashok avasthi ne india today ko bataaya, ‘‘ham kisi ke khilaaf badale kii bhaavana se chapa nahin maarthe
 Action is taken against a person when we get enough evidence to take action against him
 ’’ vibhaag ke ek adhikari bataate hai, ‘‘lokayukta santhaan main vaise to lokayukta hi sabase mahatvapurn hote hai, lekin dekha jaae to har karmchaaree mahatvapurn he, har kisi kaa kaam banta hua he or sabhi bakhubi apane kaam ko nibhaate hai
 The entire action can be spoiled by the mistake of one person
 isliye jab chaape kii karrwai kaamyaab hoti he to usamen sanghathan ke har vyakti kaa baraabar yogadan hota he
 Like other institutions, the Lokayukta institute is provided with the budget from the state government

 is
 lekin iske baavjood sansadhano kii kami he
 The deficiency in Bhopal can be gauged from the fact that there is only one typist for 12 people
 is vajah se us par kaam kaa boj kuch zyada hi hota he
 Institutional challenges are also present in front of the Lokayukta police who are constantly active in this way
 ashok avasthi bataate hai, ‘‘1 janvari, 2014 se lekar ab tak lokayukta police ne ek anumaan ke mutabik 15 maamalon main 50-60 karod ru
 Has exposed illegal assets
 kisi ke bhi khilaaf jab karrwai kii jaati he to vah lokayukta act ke tahat kii jaati he
 The special thing is that out of the action taken by the organization, prosecution is done in 65 percent of the cases
 ’’yah bhi sach he ki lokayukta police jis teji se bhrasht adhikariyon ke khilaaf karrwai kar rahi he, waisi karrwai bhrashtachar ke aaropee rajanetaaon ke khilaaf najar nahin aati
 But Awasthi denies any pressure
 ve kehete hai, ‘‘lokayukta santhaan kabhi bhi kisi ke dabaav main nahin aayaa
 It can be seen that action has been taken against even the most prominent accused after it was found that the accused have committed corruption
 jo bhi bhrashtachar karegaa, uske khilaaf karrwai hogi
 The Lokayukta activism gave the fight against corruption, but will they also hold corrupt leaders in their grip? ab tak star putr suraj pancholi or tiger shroff saath-saath varjish kiya karte the, ab bade parde par ek saath dushmano par laat-ghunson kii barsaat karte dikhenge

 Mendiratta said, "it is true that the Commission did not contact them during the hearing of the disqualification of 21 mlas of the Aam Admi Party or before sending a recommendation to the President, did not take any opinion from them

 Precautions on increasing pollution level sanyukt raashtra kii pari ke baad shashi tharur jab raajnneeti main kadam rakh rahe the, us dauraan kai siyaasi dalon ne unhen apane paale main shaamil karne kaa prastaav diya
 But Tharoor, who started his career as a member of the UN High Commission for Refugee, chose Congress for a political journey
 tharur ne ek baar kaha tha ki jab unhone apane raajnneetik jivan kii shuruyaat kii thi, tab unase congress, vampanthi dalon or bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ne sampark kiya gaya tha
 But he chose Congress because he was ideologically comfortable with it
 march 2009 ke aam chunaavon main tharur kerala ke tiruvanantpuram se congress ke tikat par chunaav maidan main utre to unke pratidwandviyon ne unhen elite or bahari aadmi bataakar unke khilaaf prachaar karnaa shuru kiya
 But despite all these criticisms, Tharoor won the election by a margin of around 100,000

 But Indianism is embedded in his mood
 jinhone bhi gaur se dekha hoga wo bataa sakate hai ki unke suut kii jeb par laga tirangaa isaki gavaahi detaa he
 He is perhaps the first person to be ranked first among such figures who is a staunch critic of British rule
 unki pustak 'an Era of Darkness: The British Empire in India' isaki tasdik karti he
 Later this book was published in Hindi from Vani Prakashan, 'dark Age: British Empire in India'
 tharur ne shodh se yah sabit kiya ki bharat ke liye british shashan kitna nuksaandaayak tha
 But perhaps his personality is such that the English word does not leave him
 netaa nahin lekhak bhibaharhaal, tharur 15 katha-sahitya or anya pustakon ke lokapriy lekhak hai
 His books include the satirical book The Great Indian Novel 1989, India: From Midnight to the Millennium (1997) and India Shastra: Reflections on the Nation in Our Time 2015

 He won again in Thiruvananthapuram despite a Modi wave in 2014
 twit, troling or kaital classlandan main 9 march 1956 ko janme tharur kaa vivaadon se naata bhi purana he
 Perhaps that's why trolling is not considered new to Tharoor in the social media world
 unhen kai baar apane twit kii vajah se aalochanaon kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Tharoor tweeted on 9 August 2017, 'now the only controversy is what the Mughalai Paratha should be called now
 shivaji paratha yaa phir dinadayal upaadhyaay paratha?' upie sarkaar main mantri rahete hue tharur ne ek aisa twit kiya jiskaa matlab samajhane ke liye bahut se logon ko shabdkosh kii madad leni padi
 In 2009, when the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government appealed to its ministers to cut spending
 us dauraan videsh rajya mantri rahe tharur ne ek twit main likhaa ki kifayat baratane ke kaam main ve apane baaki mantriyon ke saath hawaii jahaaj kii iconomi class yaa unke shabdon main maveshi shrenee (cattle class) main yatra karne ko taiyaar hai
 Although he later apologized for it and wrote in a tweet, it is an unnecessary experiment, but was not used to disrespect those traveling in economy class
