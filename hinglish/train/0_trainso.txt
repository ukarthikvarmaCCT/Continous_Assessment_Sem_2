 Congress leader Digvijay Singh said on Tuesday, a day after he claimed to have evidence of a phone conversation with Hemant Karkare just before the Mumbai attacks, that he was unable to obtain the phone record but that he would be sending a police officer to right-wing Hindu organizations Persists on his remarks about being threatened by singh ko haal hi main assam main hone vaale chunaav ke liye party maamalon kaa prabharee banaaya gaya he
 He told reporters, 'I am not a liar
 mere liye yah jhooth bolne kii koi vajah nahin he ki maine shahid aties pramukh hemanth karkare se baat kii thi
 The former Madhya Pradesh chief minister claimed on Monday that he had records that Karkare had spoken to him
 singh ne mangalvaar ko kaha ki unhone doorsanchaar mantralay se anurodh kiya he ki unke or police adhikari ke bich hui baatcheet ke saare record pune sthit recovery centre se unhen dilwaaye jaayen
 He said that he had earlier requested the general manager of Bhopal-based BSNL in this regard but received a written reply from there that the details of the number could not be provided as there is only a record of 12 months
 singh ne kaha ki unhone karkare se bhopal sthit apane panjikrut number se baat kii thi
 The Congress general secretary had said that during the phone conversation with him, Karkare had told the right-wing organizations that he was a threat
 unhone kaha, ‘mujhe jhooth failaane kii koi jarurat nahin he
 i stand by what i said
 yah koi nayi baat nahin he
 i have said this many times to electronic media and print media
 ’ unhone in baton ko bhi puri tarah se ‘betuka bataakar khaarij’ kar diya ki vah mumbai hamalon ke maamle main jaanch par sawaal uthaa rahe hai yaa unke kehane ke ye myne hai ki karkare kii maut ke maamle main pakistani aatankwaadi sanlipt nahin the
 Singh said that the BJP specializes in two types of talk and it is causing confusion about his comments
 unhone kaha, ‘mujhe pakistani aatankwaadiyon kii mumbai hamalon main sanliptata ke bare main koi andeh nahin he
 i am satisfied with the investigation
 ’ singh ne assam ke purv mukhyamantri prafull kumaar mahant ke is aarope ko khaarij kar diya ki vah desh main sampradayik vibhed paidaa karne ke liye karkare kaa bataur hathiyaar istemaal kar rahe hai
 He said, 'mahant is my old friend
 unhen is tarah kii bayaanbaji nahin kerani chaiye
 Taking a dig at the BJP, Singh said that soon after the incident, then Governor Julio Rebero also said that Karkare had met him a few days before the Mumbai attacks
 singh ne kaha ki karkare ne rabero ko bataaya tha ki vah bhaajapa ke varisht netaa laalkrishna adwani, rajnath singh or kuch hindu sanghathanon ke un par ‘bebuniyaad aarope lagaaye jane or unki eemaandaaree par sawaal uthaaye jane se’ du:khee hai
 He said, 'I want to ask the BJP what was the right of Advani and Rajnath Singh to question the honesty of Karkare
 kya desh ke purv grih mantri kaa yah krity jaanch ko prabhavit karne or karkare ko hatotsahit karne kii koshish nahin tha
 ' kendriya madhyamik shiksha board (sibiesai) kii 10veen kaksha ke ganit or 12veen kaksha ke arthshaastra ke prashnptr li hone kii ghatana ko lekar deshbhar main board kii pariksha pranali par sawaal uth rahe hai
 In such a situation, former CBSE President Ashok Ganguly expressed his opinion about this in the 'five Questions of Bhasha News Agency' series
 prashn 1
 How do the Central Board of Secondary Education view the occurrence of question paper leaks in the CBSE Class 10 and Class 12 examination? Answer: CBSE examination system has been very specific and despite that the question paper leaking is worrying because of publication or Collection center level security system comes under question
 aise main pariksha vyavastha kii bade str par jaanch karaae jane kii jarurat he
 Question 2
 is chook ke kya-kya kaaran ho sakate hai? kya aap ise sthapit prakriyaaon kaa ulanghan maanate hai?uttar: sibiesai ne parikshaon ke sanchaalan main maharath hasil kii he lekin prashnptr li hone kii is ghatana se lagata he ki vyavastha laaparvaahee kii shikaar ho rahi he
 CBSE had prepared a system to prepare a set of several question papers for such exams
 pehle kshetra ke hisaab se prashn patron ke set alag-alag hote the
 Some state boards have adopted this system
 lekin kuch samay baad sibiesai ne kai prashnpatron ke set 'multiple set' taiyaar karne kii pranali ko tyaag diya
 If we continued the system of multiple set based question papers, then the impact of leakage incident would have been less, then there is no need to take the exam again in the whole country
 prashn 3
 Has there been a flaw in the process? If yes, what steps need to be taken immediately? Answer: In a few years the number of students has increased considerably, accordingly new examination centers have been created
 board ko in kendron kii jaanch kerani hogi, varanaa is tarah kii ghatnaayen baar baar ho sakati hai
 When you manage such a big exam then you should have Plan b and Plan c ready
 hamen silband prashnpatron ke set kii pariksha centre par jaanch ke liye ek vyavastha taiyaar kerani hogi jisamen sibiesai kaa ek paryvekshak shaamil ho
 Also read: Gurus scam in Rajasthan, 9 arrests in the University pepperleak case 4
 pariksha centre par electranik rup main prashnptr pahunchane or phir print karaane ke prastaav ko aap kis rup main dekhte hai?uttar: desh ke vyapak bhugolic vistaar or basaavat ko dekhte hue electranik rup main prashnptr pahunchane or phir vahaan print karaane kaa prastaav vyaavhaarik nahin lagata he
 Question 5
 prashnptr li maamla schuli shiksha ke liye kitna nuksaan pahunchane vaala he?uttar: aswasthkar pratispardhaa ke kaaran samaaj par dushprabhav pad rahaa he
 This incident is an example of this unhealthy competition where some elements leaked the question paper, but the students are the only losers
 ise bhi padhein : paper li hone par pariksha sthagit, students ne VC aphis main kii todfodgauratlab he ki sibiesai ke purv adhyaksh ashok ganguli ne prashnptr li hone par chintaa jataai he kyonki prashnptr li hone se shiksha pranali kii vyavastha par bhi sawaal uth rahe he
 Also, the board of new examination centers will have to check and set up a system for examining the set of sealed question papers at the examination center which includes a supervisor of CBSE
 varanaa is tarah kii ghatnaayen baar baar ho sakati hai
 The most impact of paper leakage is on the students

 Union Minister of State for Agriculture Sanjeev Balyan blamed the active 'onion lobby' in Maharashtra for the rising prices of onions and said that buffer stock would be created in North India to reduce its impact
 baaliyaanne buudhvaar ko ek kaarykram ke itar sanvadadaaton se kaha, 'maharashtra kii pyaaj lobby ne puure desh main sankat paidaa kar mahangaai failaai
 Now the central government is ready to tighten the lobby

 There will also be large-scale buffer storage
 ' kendriya mantri ne kaha ki 6 maheene pehle kendra ne uttar pradesh samet sabhi rajyon se daal kii aavashyaktaa par jaankaree maangi thi
 Uttar Pradesh did not respond to this
 daal or pyaaj kii jamkhori ke khilaaf abhiyaan chalaaya gaya to uttar pradesh ne chhapamar karrwai karnaa bhi uchit nahi samajha
 Due to this, the prices of onions, pulses etc
 kept increasing and profiteers and hoarders continued to be rich
 kendriya mantri ne kaha ki abhi tak dalhan kharid main sarkaar ruchi nahin leti thi, lekin jamaakhoron se nipatane ke liye kendra sarkaar ab kisaanon se daal kharid karne kii yojana bana rahi he
 This will control inflation and farmers will get direct benefits
 walion ne kaha ki bazaar main jald aaayaatit daalen aa jaayengi
 This will reduce the prices of pulses

 There was a time when tourism in the country meant to travel religiously, but in the last 2 decades the thinking of Indian society has changed and people not only go out for a holiday but also like to celebrate the weekend
 paryaton se na sirf sarkaar ko khaasi kamai hoti he balki kai logon ko rojgaar bhi miltaa he
 In such a situation, the goal of Modi government is to promote tourism in its second term
 bajet 2019 main bhi sarkaar ne paryaton ke kshetra main vikaas ke liye bade kadam uthaane kaa vaada kiya he
 People have started spending in the field of tourism apart from basic things
 videshi paryatakon ke saath-saath badi sankhya main deshi paryatak bhi desh ke anya hisson main ghoomane ke liye lagaataar nikal rahe hai

 5 million) ho jaaegi, jabaki mana ja rahaa he ki 2020 tak desh main medical tourism industry 6169 karod rupee (9 billian dollar) kaa ho jayega
 The government is trying to promote tourism, but in order to succeed and increase earnings, there is a need to improve public awareness as well as facilities
 paryaton ke kshetra main apaar sambhaavnaaen hai, deshi-videshi paryatakon ke aane se na sirf rojgaar badhegaa balki aarthik sampannataa bhi aegi
 The Supreme Court has ruled that reservation rules like Scheduled Caste, Scheduled Tribe or Other Backward Class quota will not be applicable in the up gradation (upward movement) of posts in government establishments as their benefit can only be given in promotion
 aarvi rabindran or markandeya katju kii peeth ne kendriya prashasnic panchat kii chennai shakha or madras ucch nyaayalay ke is sanyukt faisle ko khaarij kar diya ki aarakshan ke niyam padon ke samunnayan main bhi lagu honge
 Justice Raveendran, while writing the order, said that neither the promotion nor the promotion takes place, hence the benefit of reservation will not be given in it
 samunnayan main ucch vetanman dekar keval vittiya laabh uplabdh karaae jate hai
 If only posts are upgraded which is different from promotion, the rules of reservation will not apply
 nyaayalay ne yah aadesh jari karte hue bharat sanchaar nigam limited (beasenel) dwaara daayar apil ko sahi tehraaya
 In this appeal, the tribunal's instructions to reinstate the services of certain employees in Grade One v across the country were challenged

 After the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the entire film of Narendra Modi was also made, but in the swearing-in ceremony, he definitely showed the trailer of political power
 laalkrishna adwani hon yaa sushamaa swaraj
 Be it Nitin Gadkari or Arun Jaitley
 rajnath singh hon yaa venkaiya naidu
 The faces of the BJP, which the country recognizes, were seen on the grand stage of Modi's swearing-in ceremony
 madhyapradesh ke mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan hon yaa chhattisgarh ke siem raman singh yaa phir karnataka kii sarkaar chalaa rahe jagadish shettar
 Realized the magic of Modi at the Sardar Patel Stadium in Ahmedabad
 modi ke mehmaanon kii fehrist yaheen khatm nahin hui
 From Vasundhara Raje to Ravi Shankar Prasad, be present at the swearing-in ceremony
 2014 main bijepi kii taraf se pradhanmantri pad ke sabase tagade daavedaar maane ja rahe modi ne party kii rajya ikai ke adhyaksh or padaadhikariyon ko bhi samaaroh main bula kar bina kuch kahe piem in vatting kaa sandesh de diya
 No one has spoken or spoken in favor of Modi, but no one denies that Modi's role is big during the Lok Sabha elections
 bijepi ke tamaam netaaon kii maujuudagi main jis tarah se modi ke samarthan main naare lage, usase saaf he ki gujarat ke raste dilli ko jeetne kaa sapana kitna bada ho gaya he
 There is no dearth of contenders in the BJP to fill the vacant space of Vajpayee and Advani, but Modi has started appearing in the front line
 gujarat ko pehle hindutv or phir vikaas kii prayogshaala banane vaale modi ke aalochak bhi unke karishmai shakhsiyat or siyaasi kabaliyat ke kaayal he
 Modi may have governed Gujarat, but his stature became national
 modi ne hindutv kii raajnneeti par vikaas kaa mullama chadha kar apni siyasat ko nayaa aayam de diya, lekin mishan dilli ke liye sirf yahi kaaphi nahin
 Modi also knows that, so he made all those nobles of politics a guest of his ceremony, important in the strategy of NDA
 modi ke manch par shivasena ke adhyaksh uddhav thakare bhi dikhe to emenes ke adhyaksh raaj thakare
 If Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar was not invited to the ceremony, then Odisha CM Naveen Patnaik himself did not come, but he definitely sent the government
 lekin tamilnadu kii mukhyamantri jayalalita kii maujuudagi ne siyaasi kayaasabaaji ko nai hawa de di
 However, no one is currently answering the question whether in view of Modi's growing strength, there will be a new entrenchment in the NDA for 2014? pakistan ke pradhanmantriimran khaanne mangalvaar ko kaha ki vah bharat main 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaavon ke baad uski tarfdosti kaa hathek baar phir badhayenge
 He believes that New Delhi turned down his offer to negotiate because Pakistan is an issue in elections in the neighboring country
 riyaad main future investment initeative forum ko sambodhit karte hue khan ne kaha ki pakistan apane sabhi padosiyon or khaskar bharat or afghanistan ke saath shanti chahta he

 According to the information, a young man wrote 'I write' instead of the number on the number plate of his new bullet

 The police deemed it to be a scandal of the law
 yuvak ne police ke poochne par bhi vahi baat doharaa di

 There were also calls from many advocates to pressurize them to leave the vehicle, but the inspector clearly said that 'likhai Tabbe Thane Jai'
 sandesh saaf tha ki bullate par jab tak number nahin likh jayega, tab tak use thane main hi rakhaa jayega
 Inspector Rajiv Ranjan, in charge of Bhelupur police station, has given a clarification on catching the issue
 unhone kaha ki aksar dekha jaataa he ki bagaiyr number kii gadiyon se aparaadh hote rahete hai
 In such a situation, identification of the offender becomes difficult

 On being asked by the police, the bullet driver clarified that Sir, writing English for Applied for would have the same meaning
 aise main usne angreji kii jagah sthaneey banarsi bhashaa kaa upyog kiya
 He said that the police, while responding to the bullet driver in the local language itself, said that 'likhai Tabbe Thane Jai' and the bullet was brought to the police station
 ranjan ne kaha ki ab bullate ko chhodane kaa nirnay nyaayalay karegaa

 is koreokrasi main aapkaa swaagat he
 The leader having his own intelligence officer is telling that you have to walk in a party according to the leader
 netaa hi party he
 It started with the entry of outside strategy managers into the party at the time of elections
 pehle ye party ke liye aae or ab ye netaa ke liye aane lage hai
 Many leaders, equipped with resources and black money in different party have also started forming their own team
 chunaav ke vakt amareeki vishvavidhyalayon se kai bekaar chaatr yahaan badlaav ke naam par aate hai or netaaon ko safalataa kaa maarg bataane ke naam par un saare tareekon se las kar jate hai jisase kisi netaa ke liye party kii zarurat hi na rahe
 Similar work has also been done by strategists of advertising and slogan companies
 pichley loksabhaa main is prakriya kaa paripakv rup dekhne ko mila tha
 The selection of Narendra Modi as the prime ministerial candidate had more social media and media involvement than bjp's own leaders
 jise khud narendra modi ne sangathit rup se sanchalit kiya
 Namo Fan pressured from within the party that whoever has become our leader, you have to choose him as the leader
 uske baad ki sari prakriyaayein baahar se aae is dabaav ke anukool hoti raheen
 The hostile powers were rapidly collapsing
 main nahin kahata ki narendra modi yogya ummidavaar nahin the balki unke chayan main is prakriya ko nazarandaaz nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 During the Lok Sabha elections, in many places i found a team of youth with laptops
 ve puure din party ke ummidavaar ke chunavi karyaalay se lekar ilaake main ghumaa karte the dekhne ke liye ki janaab chunaav thik se lard rahe hai yaa nahin
 i met a group of such talented youngsters who came to prepare the BJP candidate's feedback
 unamem se kai narendra modi ke prati samarpit to nahin the magar ve is kaam ko peshewar tareeke se kar rahe the
 Those youths claimed that by submitting each information, they send it directly to their central team and from there reach Narendra Modi
 main isaki sachai ko satyapit nahin kar saktaa lekin feedback jamaa karne kaa yah tarika kaaphi anokhaa laga
 There are many times that a candidate sits with a ticket or does not contest properly
 chunaav prachaar ke dauraan party kaaryakartaaon se uske sambandh behatar nahin hote hai
 All this can be very risky because losing these reasons could have affected the future of the leader
 itnaa hi nahin us sansadeey kshetra main narendra modi kii raily bhi hone vaali thi jiske liye muddon se lekar feedback tak taiyaar kar unhen bhej diya gaya tha
 In a way, these boys were also acting like their personal auditors
 isaki shuruyaat bhi kuch chunaav pehle se ho chuki he
 When the candidates were privately keeping spies to get information about the opposing camp
 bachapan kaa ek kissa yaad aata he jo kisi se suna tha ki ek saansad the jo kehete the ki ham jitna chunaav lade utana fiks dipazit kar diye
 When Indira ji wavered, she won and if there was no wave, she lost
 party se jo paisa mila wo fiks dipazit kar diye
 Later, he went through many such stories that the candidate, knowing that he would lose the ticket from the party, because he gets a lot of money from the party fund and the party supporters of the area as soon as the ticket is received
 nishchit rup se aise chunavi kamau ummidavaaron kaa kissa maine congress main zyada suna he
 Later this disease also entered the BJP
 jiskaa upaay narendra modi ne apana system taiyaar kar khoj liya
 The comments party yaa netaa ke lihaaz se dekhen to chunaav jeetne ke liye sab acha he lekin is prakriya main kya badal rahaa he us par nazar rakhni chahie
 What can the leader of a team of its intelligence officers in a party mean
 kya us netaa kaa apni party par bharosa nahin rahaa jiskaa wo netaa he
 Every leader seems to be taking recourse to these non-political tricks of control and surveillance over the party
 demokrasi koreokrasi main badalati ja rahi he
 The way choreography is created on one stage, in the same way in politics, waves are now being created for the leader
 netaa ab ek avatar he jo aasmaan se laanch hota he
 Event management companies are the only real political parties
 raajnneetik dalon kaa buniyadi charitra tezi se badal rahaa he
 One should try to understand this process
 sanghathan ab mukhyalay tak simat kar rah gaya he or mukhyalay bhi satta main baithe netaa kaa ek vistaar yani ekstansion counter banakar rah gaya he
 The activist has been replaced by a fan who maintains a pro-activeness on social media
 kaaryakarta ek alag kism kaa jaivik or saamaajik praani he jabaki fain kritrim ho saktaa he or kuch samay se lekar lambey samay tak ke liye ho saktaa he
 Institutions within the party are becoming non-essential
 kai partiyon main sanghathan ke chunaav bemaani ho chuke hai
 The party's executive functions have remained a counter to the contracting event company
 intelligence afasar or iti cell hi ab party honge jo ek netaa ke liye kaam karenge
 Where there will be no place of ideology
 ek ranneeti hogi jo saamne vaale kii galati kaa turant phayda uthaane ke liye taiyaar rahegi

 Welcome to this choreocracy
 loksabhaa chunaavon ke dauraan kai jagahon par mujhe laptaap yukt yuvaaon kii team mili
 They roamed the entire day from the party candidate's election office to the area to see if Zanab was fighting the elections properly
 aisa hi behad pratibhashali yuvaaon kaa ek dal mujhe mila jo bijepi ke ummidavaar kaa feedback taiyaar karne aayaa tha
 Many of them were not devoted to Narendra Modi but they were doing this work in a professional manner
 un yuvaaon kaa daawa tha ki ek ek jaankaree jamaa kar ve sidhe apni kendriya team ko bhejte hai or vahaan se narendra modi tak pahunch jaataa he
 i cannot verify the veracity of this but found this method of collecting feedback quite unique
 kai baar hota he ki ummidavaar tikat lekar baith jaataa he yaa thik se chunaav nahin ladata he
 During the election campaign his relations with party workers are not better
 yah sab kaaphi jokhim kaa kaam ho saktaa he kyonki in vajahon se haarane ke kaaran netaa ke bhavishya par asar pad saktaa tha
 Not only this, Narendra Modi's rally was also going to be held in that parliamentary constituency, for which from issues to feedback, they were prepared and sent
 ye ladke ek tarah se apane nijee auditor kii tarah bhi kaam kar rahe the
 It has already started some elections
 jab ummidavaar nijee taur par jasoos rakhane lage the taaki virdohi kheme kii jaankaree mil sake
 There is an anecdote of childhood that recounts from someone that there was an MP who used to say that we should deposit as many fixes as we fought
 jab indira ji kii lahar hui to jeet gaye or lahar nahin rahi to haar gaye
 Deposit the money that was received from the party
 baad main aise kai kisson se guzara ki ummidavaar jaanate hue bhi ki vahaan se haaregaa party se isliye tikat chahta he kyonki tikat milte hi party fund or ilaake ke party samarthakon se kaaphi paisa mil jaataa he
 Certainly i have heard more about the story of such electoral candidates
 baad main yah beemaari bijepi main bhi ghus ai
 Whose solution was found by Narendra Modi by designing his system
 tippaniyan From the point of view of the party or leader, it is all good to win the election, but what is changing in this process should be closely monitored
 ek party main netaa kii apni intelligence afasaron kii team ke myne kya ho sakate hai
 Did the leader not trust his party of which he is the leader? har netaa party par niyantran or nigaraanee ke in gaiyr-raajnneetik totakon kaa sahaara letaa hua nazar aa rahaa he
 Democracy is changing into choreocracy
 jis tarah ek manch par koreography se dhadakanen paidaa kar di jaati hai usee tarah se raajnneeti main bhi ab netaa ke liye lehren paidaa kii ja rahi hai
 The leader is now an avatar who launches from the sky
 event management companiyaan hi ab asli raajnneetik dal hai
 The basic character of political parties is changing rapidly
 is prakriya ko samajhane kaa prayaas karnaa chahie
 The organization is now confined to the headquarters and the headquarters has also become an extension of the leader sitting in power i
e
 the extension counter
 kaaryakarta kii jagah fain ne le lee he jo soshal media par netaa ke prati sakriyata banaae rakhte hai
 a worker is a different type of biological and social animal whereas a fan can be artificial and can last for some time to a long time
 party ke bheetar kii sansthaaen gair zaruri hoti ja rahi hai
 Organization elections in many parties have become meaningless
 party kii kaaryakariniyan event company ko theka dene kaa counter banakar rah gayi hai
 Intelligence officers and IT cells will now be the party that will work for a leader
 jahaan vichaardhaara kii koi jagah nahin hogi
 There will be a strategy that will be ready to take immediate advantage of the fault of the front
 is koreokrasi main aapkaa swaagat he
 There are many times that a candidate sits with a ticket or does not contest properly
 chunaav prachaar ke dauraan party kaaryakartaaon se uske sambandh behatar nahin hote hai
 All this can be very risky because losing these reasons could have affected the future of the leader
 itnaa hi nahin us sansadeey kshetra main narendra modi kii raily bhi hone vaali thi jiske liye muddon se lekar feedback tak taiyaar kar unhen bhej diya gaya tha
 In a way, these boys were also acting like their personal auditors

 As soon as the festive season comes, the market gets rougher, there are offers on every side, but this time more than the market, there are more e-commerce sites
 yahan har tarah ke products par owers kii bharmaar he
 According to ASSOCHAM survey, e-commerce sites can do business of 25 thousand crores this time
 festive sizan shuru ho chukaa he or sizan main owers kaa intazaar graahakon ko rahata he or is baar owers kii shuruyaat oktober shuru hote hi ho gayi he
 Due to the paternal side, people were stopped from buying new items and now after the end, all the e-commerce sites have a cell with different names and every product is present in this cell
 asocham ne desh ke 10 shaharon main survey karavaaya jisamen 2500 logon se baat kii gayi
 According to the survey, this bari-commerce sites will do business of 2500 crores
 di es ravat, secreteri general asocham kaa kahana he ki is saal graahakon ko acha faaydaa hoga
 Because there will be better deals in competition between companies and sites
 survey main asocham ne mahila or purushon baat kii jisamen logon kii raay ye thi ki ghar par jab shopping ke itane opshans hon to phir bheed main jane kii kya zarurat he
 But due to these offers, the local market will suffer a lot
 asocham ke mutabiq sabase zyaada nuqasaan shopping malls ko hoga
 But to see what is the movement in the market, we turned to CP, then the movement was less visible, after that Sadar reached the market and the customers were working in the market
 sadar bazaar assosieshan ke adhyaksh rakesh yadav kii maane to isse chote vyapaaree par asar pad rahaa he or kaafii nuqasaan hoga
 At this time, where there is silver of e-commerce in this boom of offers, the markets are at a disadvantage, but the customer seems to be benefiting in this fight

 Released this week is Neeraj Pandey's Special 26, starring Akshay Kumar, Manoj Bajpayee, Anupam Kher, Jimmy Shergill, Divya Dutta and Kajal Aggarwal
 
 
 'special 26' varsh 1987 main ghati sachhee ghatnaon par aadhaarit he, jab maun singh naam ke ek shaks ne apane kuch saathiyon ke saath milakar nakli sibiai afasar banakar desh ke kai shaharon main red daali thi or karodon kaa maal lekar chanpat ho gaya tha
 
 
 In the film too, Ajay, ie Akshay Kumar, along with his team put some such fake raid and keep dodging the real CBI officer Wasim, ie Manoj Vajpayee
 
 
 tippaniyan Neeraj Pandey is a good director, he proved this in his very first film 'A Wednesday', and now in 'special 26', he has worked wisely by keeping the story close to reality, but some problems in the film's story Is in 
 
 darasal, aapako pehle se pataa hoga ki kahani nakli sibiai afasaron or unke dwaara luute gaye logon se judi he, isliye film ke pehle hisse main sirf or sirf yahi dikhaai degaa ki kis safai se akshay or anupam logon ko bevakoof banaate hai
 
 
 During this period, there is no such high-point where you can say 'wow'
 
 
 vaise film kuch jagah aapke chehre par muskuraahat le aati he
 
 
 Anupam's acting is good, Akshay has also done fine, but Manoj Bajpayee has once again won the acting arena
 
 
 jimi shergill or divya datta ne apane-apane kirdaaron ke saath nyaay kiya he, lekin film kii heroin kaajal or unka kirdaar agar film main nahin bhi hota, to koi khaas fark nahin padataa
 
 
 Neeraj probably succumbed to the pressure of commercial cinema
 
 
 khayr, film kaa climex aapako vaaki chaunkaa degaa
 
 
 The background music of the film is also strong
 
 
 kul milakar dekhne laayak film he 'special 26', or is film ke liye meri reating he - 3 star

 telecom companiyon ko supreme court se bada jhatka laga he
 The court said during the hearing that these companies had to 1 to DOT
 33 lakh karod rupee kaa bakaayaa den
 The court will decide the extent to which this arrears will be given
 telecom companiyon ne bakaayaa chukaane ke liye 6 maheene kaa samay maanga tha
 The Department of Telecommunications has claimed in the Supreme Court that about 1 on companies like Indian Airtel, vodafone-idea and r Com
 33 lakh karod rupee kaa bakaayaa he
 This includes Rs 92000 crore as license fee and Rs 41000 crore in room for spectrum usage charges
 sunwaayee ke dauraan DOT ne court main kaha ki termination shulk ke alaava telecom companiyon ko milane vaali sabhi rajasav, roming shulk AGR kaa hi hissaa he
 While telecom companies plead that non-telecom revenue such as rent, internet income, dividend income etc
 should be excluded from AGR
 2006 main TD SAT ne AGR ke mudde par telecom companiyon ke paksh main faisla diya tha
 The dot then challenged this decision in the Supreme Court and in 2008 the Court had given an interim stay on the decision of TD SAT and issued notice to the telecom companies

 The path ahead from where the Aam Aadmi Party is standing at the moment is inextricable and even more important is that their team is shattered, important people are leaving them and there is growing disharmony among those who are there
 ab nai baat yah ho gai ki adaalat ne avmaananaa ke maamle main arvind kejariwal par aarope tay kar die gaye hai jo unke liye bahut kathinaayee paidaa kar sakate hai
 The enthusiasm with which he openly made allegations against BJP leader Nitin Gadkari is getting expensive for him
 dilli kii jaj ne un par is maamle main dhara 499 or 500 ke tahat aarope tay kar die hai
 Kejriwal did not consider it appropriate to settle the matter even after the judge's initiative, which cannot be called a far-sighted move
 lekin usase bhi badi samasya to yah he ki unke do pramukh sipahsalaar aapas main hi bhid gaye hai
 At first Yogendra Yadav and Naveen Jaihind clashed
 abhi vah maamla shant padaa bhi nahin tha ki kejariwal ke khaas mitra manish sisodiya yogendra yadav se takaraa gaye
 Both have started a battle through email and Manish is not hurting from attacking Yogendra
 manish un par aarope laga rahe hai ki unke kehane par hi kejariwal dilli kii bajaay puure bharat main chunaav ladane ko taiyaar ho gaye the
 But those who know the nature of Kejriwal will laugh at Manish's statement
 aam aadmi party ke pramukh arvind kejariwal mahatvakankshi or publicity pasand vyakti hai
 How important the party is to them, it is only from this that they did not even go to look into their areas after having fielded more candidates than all the parties in the Lok Sabha elections
 ve sirf narendra modi ke chunaav kshetra varanasi main rahe taaki unhen puri milage milti rahe
 Hundreds of candidates stood by him and stood by him
 unhen manjhdhaar main chhodkar netaa ji apana chunaav ladane lag gaye
 The bottom line of all this is that the Aam Aadmi Party is going through a delicate phase at the moment
 ab dekhnaa he ki kejariwal main kitni pratibha or netritv kii kala he kyonki us samay desh ek aise daur se guzar rahaa tha jisamen eemaandaar or jujharu netaa kii dilli ke logon ko jarurat thi
 He saw those qualities in Kejriwal and he went along with them and became a caravan
 lekin aaj narendra modi ke vishaal kad ke saamne sabhi netaa chote dikh rahe hai
 In such a situation, the magic of Kejriwal has disappeared
 bachi-khuchi kasar netaaon or kaaryakartaaon ke asantosh ne puri kar di
 Now the challenge before the party is to save its existence
 ab aage kaa rasta duruh he
 They must first unite the disintegrating party and then strengthen it
 aaj kii paristhitiyon main yah koi aasaan kaam nahin he
 The morale of the workers has dropped and the middle class people who were once their base are now getting away from them
 party main vichaardhaara kaa bahut bada sankat he kyonki kejariwal ab bhrashtachar se bada mudda sampradayikta ko maanate hai
 This is an issue that suits Congress, Left parties and Yadav parties more
 ve isi ke boote par raajnneeti kii apni 'dukaan' chalaate hai
 When so many parties and leaders are engaged in this 'noble' purpose then it is difficult to say where Kejriwal will fit in that crowd
 kejariwal ke liye yah pariksha kii kathin ghadi he or ab pataa chalegaa ki vah kitne kushal netaa hai
 Gogoi, who was the chief minister of the state from 2001 to 2016, claimed that the then home minister LK Advani wanted KPS Gill, the former chief of Punjab Police, to be the governor of Assam to eradicate militancy in the northeast

 Now Mahanta says that he did so on the instructions of the Center
 'assam bhaajapa ke mahasachiv dilip saciya ne aaropon ko khaarij kar diya
 Saikia said, 'this is a baseless allegation
 hamane hameshaa bharat kii akhandta main vishwaas kiya he lekin nirdosh logon kii gupt hatya kii keemat par nahin
 If he was honest, why did he not order an investigation into the secret killings? He is doing cheap, divisive politics
 ' unhone kaha ki congress ne ulpha ke saath vaarta todi
 Prafulla Kumar Mahanta of the Assam Gana Parishad (AGP) said that his predecessor Congress leader Hiteshwar Saikia started the work of secret killings
 unhone aarope lagaae, ‘congress ne gupt hatyaon kii shuruyaat kii
 Hiteshwar Saikia did it
 iskaa pehla shikaar tejpur kaa bhupen bora bana jiskaa congress sarkaar ne apharan karakar hatya kara di
 Saikia was the Chief Minister of Assam from 1991 to 1996
 yah poochne par ki kya aisi hatyaein unke mukhyamantri kaarykaal main bhi jari raheen to mahant ne kaha, ‘suraksha sambandhi sabhi muddon ke liye ekikrut kaman javabdeh tha or yah centre sarkaar ke maatahat kaam karata tha
 Gogoi said that the NDA-1 government used to accuse him of being 'soft' towards ULFA because they did not allow innocent people to be killed

 In a special meeting Sophie told, 'I am a multitasker and i will not show at all in this matter

 hamaara yah kahana ekadam galat hoga ki bhartiya madhya varg bachaata nahin he or sirf phijulkharchi main yakeen rakhata he
 Looking at India's savings rate, it is very high and the middle class has a big contribution in it
 vah kal ke bare main bhi sochataa he
 He connects from the beginning to the needs of the house and the future of children and many more
 lekin hamaara samaaj aspireshnal / aakankshi he
 a society that is full of expectations, which has many expectations
 bharat ek aadhyatmik desh he or yahaan jivan kii jaden hindu darshan ke chaar aadhaar stambh dharm, arth, kaam or moksh se gaharaai se judi hai
 Talking of the meaning, the mother Lakshmi is mentioned
 ham unki puja karte hai or diwaali ke din ghar ke daravaaje-khidkiyaan khule rakhte hai
 This makes the importance of money and our belief in it clear
 bijness ke maamle main bharat ke chote se chote udhyami kii bhi balanceshit hameshaa thik rahati he, phir chaahe vah duniya ke kisi bhi kone main kyon na ho
 That is why Indians are considered resilient entrepreneurs
 isaki vajah se aaj arth vaala factor haaavee ho rahaa he
 Our society is divided into many levels from top to bottom
 yahaan status par jor rahata he
 Earlier it used to be based on caste system
 lekin isaki pakad dhili hoti gai, khaskar shaharon main
 Now the way to show status is changing
 neeche ke tabakon ke paas aarthik bal aa rahaa he or ve bhi bhautik chizon ke jariye apane badalte status ko dikhaanaa chaahate hai
 Of course, states like Gujarat are still an exception, where the rich people still believe in living life with simplicity
 haal kii meri japan yatra ke dauraan bhi mujhe isaki misaal dikhi
 When i met the owner of the Suzuki company, i was surprised to see that they had a car and a two-room house
 bharat main yah katai mumkin nahin
 Our middle class wants to join the progressive world
 ab uski apekshaayen puraane madhya varg jaisi nahin raheen
 Today, he wants to achieve more
 iskaa ishaara is baat se bhi mil jaataa he ki credit card companiyon ke maamle main bharat agrani desh he
 The aspirational society is always filled with expectations and enthusiasm
 usamen aage badaae kii kuwwat hoti he or vah kisi bhi tarah kii vipareet paristhitiyon se ubarne kii kshamta rakhata he
 In exactly the same way as Ghalib has said: Difficulties fell on me so much that it became easy
 bas isi falsafe par yah varg chalata he or apana safar tay karata he
 Amidst all this, he does not even stop to believe in material display
 aksar poocha jaataa he ki kya madhya varg ke apni jeb dhili karne kaa jidipi ko phayda miltaa he? ji bilkul, yah jidipi ke liye acha he
 but! Not for GDH (ie Gross Domestic Happiness)
 amir tabake ko us varg ke bare main bhi sochna chahie jiske paas is tarah ke sansaadhan nahin hai
 Social sensitivity is extremely important
 bharat sareekhe mulk ke liye yah is pahalu par najar daalana laazmi ho jaataa he kyonki desh garibi, ashiksha or kuposhan ke maamle main duniya ke baaki deshon se kaaphi aage he
 Therefore, it is very important to have the spirit of taking everyone together
 itane dher saare badlaavon kii vajah se madhya varg kii paribhaasha bhi kaaphi had tak badali he
 Earlier the rise of the middle class was regional, but now it can be seen at the national level
 isaki vajah televijan, media, communication or transport ke sadhano main ai kranti he
 The middle class has not only grown in size but it has also become much more influential than before
 or in sabase bhi badhkar yah ki ab yah jati vyavastha se bhi kaaphi upar chalaa gaya he
 As far as the money coming from the middle class is concerned, it is earning money in every way by selling jobs, agriculture and property
 afsos kii baat yah he ki is desh ke kareeb 60 fisadi log kheti se jude hai lekin jidipi main iskaa yogadan sirf 16 fisadi kaa he jabaki sarvice sector se itani badi sankhya main log nahin jude hai lekin jidipi main yah 50-55 fisadi kaa yogadan karata he
 The flow of money is from every sector
 lekin 1991 ke baad sarvice sector ke jariye aane vaale paise main jabardast ijapha hua he
 There is no pattern of spending in India
 yahaan level of satisphaction myne rakhata he
 Satisfaction for my father meant that the children should read well, get good food, have a transistor, have a car
 bas, isse zyada kuch nahin
 But now this scale of satisfaction has changed
 is ''thodaa or” kii chahat kii vajah se madhya varg kaa jamkar kharch karne kaa rujhaan kabhi khatm nahin hoga
 It will expand
 garibi kam hogi
 Our vertical is middle class, in which all people have the same aspirations, from the bottom to the top
 isliye iskaa jalawaa yun hi kaayam rahane vaala he

 adhikariyon ko anivaary upasthiti kaa diya nirdeshganna udyog mantri beemaa bharti ne daure par di safibihar ke mukhyamantrinithish kumaaraki sarkaar sushasan ke daawey karti he
 Nitish Kumar himself is also known for protocol discipline, but a minister in his government has mocked the protocol by flouting rules
 pradesh ke ganna udyog vibhaag kii mantri beemaa bharti ke aapt sachiv ne apane daure kaa protocol jari kiya he, jo protocol ke daayre main hi nahin aate
 The emergency secretary has sent the protocol of his visit to the officials of the concerned department and expressed the situation in the government of Good Governance Babu
 protocol ke mutabik mantri mahodaya daure par nahin ja rahi hai, balki unke aapt sachiv raja raman bhaskar purvi or pashchimichamparanki chini milon kaa daura karne ja rahe hai
 On the other hand, Minister Bima Bharti has given clarification in this matter
 unhone kaha ki unhen chunaav prachaar main janaa tha, isliye apane nijee aapt sachiv ko daure par bheja
 What is the protocol? It has been written in the protocol sent by the Emergency Secretary to the Minister of Sugarcane Industry that Raja Raman Bhaskar, the Hon'ble Secretary to the Sugarcane Industry Minister, has a tour program of sugar mills located in East Champaran and West Champaran from October 20 to October 23
 protocol main vah kahaan kahaan jaaenge or kab kahaan raatri vishram karenge, uski puri jaankaree thik usee tarah di gai he jaise mantriyon ke liye di jaati he
 Protocol is not released, it is important that except the ministers of the state governments, the protocol of the visits of their secretaries etc
 is not released
 yah pehla avasar he jababiharsarkaar ke kisi mantri ke nijee aapt sachiv ke daure kaa protocol jari kiya gaya he
 Let the ministers of Bihar government get two emergency secretaries
 ek to dipti colector rank kaa adhikari hota he or doosraa nijee aapt sachiv rakhane kii suvidha di jaati he
 The emergency secretary who has issued the protocol for his visit is the private security secretary
 sawaal kiye ja rahe hai ki aakhir ek aapt sachiv kaise mantri kaa darja paa saktaa he, kaise wo bade adhikariyon or chini milon ke mahaprabandhak or karypalak adhyakshon ko anivaary rup se upasthit rahane kaa nirdesh de saktaa he
 Demand for investigation of this case has also started to arise
 adhikari bhi dabi jubaan main is maamle kii jaanch kii vakaalat kar rahe hai

 kehete hai, mithai kadavaahat dur karti he, or rasagulla to iske liye khaas taur par janaa jaataa he
 But this dessert has brought bitterness between the two states - West Bengal and Odisha
 odisha kaa daawa he ki rasagulla kaa itihaas uske rajya se judaa he to vahiin pashchim bengal bhi rasagulla par apana daawa kar rahaa he
 If there is a slight difference, it is that in Bengal it is called Rosogulla, not Rasgulla
 odisha sarkaar ne rasagulla kii bhugolic pahchaan (jiaai) ke liye kadam uthaaya he
 It is claimed that the dessert belongs to him
 pashchim bengal iskaa virodh kar rahaa he
 GI is the official method that describes the point of origin of an object
 nobin chandra ke parpote animikh roy ne kaha, 'rosogulla ke bare main yah kahana ki 700 saal pehle odisha main isaki khoj hui, galat he
 During the 18th century, the Dutch and Portuguese colonists in Bengal taught the idea of making sweets with chennai and since then Rasogulla has existed
 'khanpan ke kai jaankaar maanate hai ki rasagulla kii khoj naveen chandra (inhen columbus of rosogulla bhi kaha jaataa he) ne 1868 main kii thi
 However, many experts say that recently such historical facts have come out which shows that Rasgulla is the product of Odisha
 unhone tark diya he ki puri sthit jagannatha mandir ke astitv main aane ke baad rath yatra kaa shubharambh hua
 Then Rasgulla also came into existence
 saanskrithik itihaaskaar asit mohanti ne bataaya, 'bhagwaan jagannatha dwaara maa lakshmi ko rathyatra ke samaapan ke samay rasagulla bhent karne kii parampara 300 saal puraani he
 Bengal itself believes that its rasgulla is 150 years old
 ' unhone kaha ki yah sadiyon se ek khaas oriya mithai rahaa he or ise banane kii shuruyaat isi rajya se hui he
 Odisha's Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises is engaged in linking Rasgulla with the Geographical Identity (GI) of the state
 dastavej ikattha kiye ja rahe hai jo sabit karenge ki 'pehla rasagulla' bhubaneshwar or katak ke bich astitv main aayaa tha
 But, West Bengal is finding a breakdown of all these claims

 If the PM does not come, then if he does not come, then he will be adamant on demanding the JPC, the Joint Parliamentary Committee, to investigate this issue as a big scam

 As the people's problems on this issue increase, the Congress will tighten its stand against the government
