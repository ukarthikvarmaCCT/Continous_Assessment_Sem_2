 While acquitting a widow accused of rape, a Delhi court asked whether a person acquitted of rape charges should be seen as a 'rape victim'? The Additional Sessions Judge said this while releasing the rape accused hailing from Haryana
 darasal, rape kaa aarope lagane vaali mahila apni shikaayat se mukar gai
 Judge Nivedita Anil Sharma said, "nowadays, there is anger among people everywhere that the courts are not blaming the accused of rape
 haalanki, kisi bhi vyakti yaa rape ke aaropee ko tab tak doshi nahin tehraaya ja saktaa jab tak gavaah abhiyojan paksh kaa samarthan nahin karte yaa koi thos saboot muhaiyaa nahin karaate, is maamle main peedita hi mukar gai
 The judge said that the accused, who spent a lot of time in jail during the trial of the trial, is acquitted after the victim's testimony
 aaropee ne uskaa rape nahin kiya tha
 With his consent, this person established a physical relationship

 Former captain of the Indian cricket team, Sourav Ganguly on Sunday became the chairman of the powerful Indian Cricket Control Board, that is, the BCCI
 ab bharat main cricket ko to saurav ganguli chalaayenge hi, yah ek rajnatik daanv bhi he, jisaki ruparekha bhartiya janata party (BJP) ke rashtriya adhyaksh tathaa kendriya grahamantri amit shah (amit Shah) ne taiyaar kii he, jo saurav ganguli ko (trinmul congress, yani TMC kii pramukh tathaa pashchim bengal kii lagaataar duusari baar bani mukhyamantri) mamata banerjee (mamata Banerjee) ko chunauti dene vaale ke rup main pesh karnaa chaahate hai
 Amit Shah had a brief meeting with Sourav at his Delhi residence last week
 uske turant baad unhone apane trabalashooter, yani sankatmochan assam ke netaa himant biswa sarama (himanta Biswa Sarma) ko bulaakar mumbai jane ke liye kaha
 Amit Shah is confident about the success of his strategy of 'dada vs Didi' in the battle of West Bengal
 iske baad himant biswa sarama ne ravivaar der raat tak phone par bahut jagah baat kii, or sunishchit kar diya ki BCCI ke 'chunaav' se shesh sabhi pratyaashee peeche hat jaaen
 Amit Shah's son Jai Shah became the secretary of the BCCI, and the treasurer of the Arun Dhumal Cricket Association
 arun darasal BCCI ke sheersh padaadhikari rah chuke maujuuda kendriya mantri anuraag thakur ke chote bhai hai
 Indian cricket has now been completely taken over by the BJP
 pashchim bengal main vidhansabha chunaav ab 2021 (west Bengal Assembly Elections 2021) main hona he, or cricket association of bengal (CAB) ke adhyaksh saurav ganguli ab tak apane pattey kholane se parhez karte rahe hai, or unhone narendra modi sarkaar (narendra Modi Government) ke sirf 'svachh bharat' abhiyaan kaa hi samarthan kiya he, jiske samarthan se bachaa nahin ja saktaa tha
 Sourav too confessed to meeting Amit Shah last week, but denied having any political ambitions
 dilachasp tathy yah he ki BCCI ke sheersh par saurav ganguli kaa kaarykaal sirf 10 maheene (uske baad saurav ko anivaary rup se teen saal kaa 'kooling of' period bitaana hoga, kyonki niyamon ke anusaar, cricket se jude prashasnic padon par lagaataar sirf chah saal tak rahaa ja saktaa he) kaa hoga, jo pashchim bengal vidhansabha chunaav 2021 ke liye prachaar se judakar nai pari shuru karne kaa bilkul sahi vakt hoga
 i spoke to senior BJP leaders for this column, and all of them said in unison that currently there is only a shortage of 'x-factor faces' in West Bengal
 BJP ke maujuuda rajya pramukh mukul roy (mukul Roy), jo varsh 2017 main mamata banerjee kii hi party se tuutakar aae the, ne athak parishram se soobe main BJP ko sthapit kiya he, or apni puraani party se bahut-se chehron ko BJP main lekar bhi aae hai, lekin unke paas vah vazan or karishma nahin he, jiske boote vah apni puraani bos se mukaabil ho saken
 Apart from this, Mukul Roy is also facing many corruption cases, and recently he was summoned by the Enforcement Directorate (ED)
 BJP netaaon kaa maananaa he ki bhale hi amit shah ke is tazaatreen daanv se mukul roy bahut khush na hon, lekin unke paas is yojana kaa saath dene ke alaava zyaada vikalp nahin hai
 BJP made a huge gain in West Bengal in the Lok Sabha elections held this year, and the party which won only two seats in 2014, won 18 seats this time
 amit shah bhi mamata banerjee ko chunauti dene ke liye unheen kii dharti par baar-baar pahunche
 a senior BJP leader told me, "(amit) Shah had decided that the fort of Mamata Banerjee should be demolished
 
 
 jab vah hamase kehete the ki BJP jeetegi, hamane un par yakeen nahin kiya tha, lekin nattejey bhounchakka karne vaale the
 
 
 Now when he mentions his plans for Kerala and Tamil Nadu, where BJP does not even exist, we listen to him very carefully

 The BCCI has always tried to curb transparency, so Ganguly will be judged on the basis of whether she can change the situation

 itihaas main ab se pehle netaaon ko na kabhi itnaa hey samajha gaya hoga, na hi kabhi unhen janata ke itane dabaav or gusse kaa saamana karnaa padaa hoga
 The target of the attack and the smoke emanating from the damaged buildings was not even quenched that there was an outburst of anger against the leaders
 netaa sirf hamalon ke shikaar logon ke sambandhiyon kaa hi kopbhaajan nahin bane, unke prati umadi nafrat or aakrosh rashtravyapee tha
 Of course, the fire of this hatred was so deep and so widespread that parties and leaders went to public places at their own risk
 yahaan tak ki aatankwaad ke prati kadaa rukh rakhane ke liye mashr gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi jab abhiyaan ke dauraan hi mumbai pahunche to unhen khisia kar tab turant hi lautnaa padaa jab aatankwaadiyon kii goliyon kaa nishaanaa bane maharashtra ke aatankwaad virdohi daste (aties) ke pramukh hemanth karkare kii vidhwaa ne modi kii vittiya sahaayta kii peshkash thukraa di
 The need of the hour at the moment is to form a political consensus on stringent anti-terrorism rules and to establish machinery to fight terrorism at the state and center levels
 pradhanmantri manmohan singh ko ek sarvadaleey baithak bulaakar aatankwaad se nibatane ke tareekon par gahan vichaar-vimarsh karnaa chahie tha, lekin netaaon ne apni asamvedansheeltaa or janata kii bhaawanaaon kii moorkhtapurna vyakhya karke janaakrosh ko or bhadakaayaa

 patil ko rakanpa dwaara pad se hataae jane ke baad congress par deshmukh kii jagah kisi or ko kursi par bithaane ke liye dabaav badhane laga
 To save his nose, Deshmukh claimed that he had resigned in the Congress Working Committee (CWC) meeting with Union Home Minister Shivraj Patil long ago
 iske baavjood party ne istipha kabool karne main chaar din laga die
 The reason for the delay was what Congress President Sonia Gandhi was told when she wanted the resignation of Home Minister Shivraj Patil after the Delhi attacks - that there was no consensus in the party when she was replaced by another leader
 sankat kii aisi vikat ghadi main bhi kshudra rajnatik tikadamen joro par thim
 This was the exact opposite of the way in which the party acted at the center
 or iskaa puraa shrey sonia gandhi or paroksh rup se unke bacchon, yahaan tak ki unki divangat saas indira gandhi kaa zikr aane ko he
 The most discussed issue at the beginning of the CWC meeting was Priyanka Gandhi Vadra's comment, in which she recalled her grandmother Indira Gandhi's "strong and decisive rule" against terrorism
 iske turant baad hi kathor cheharaa liye sonia gandhi ne ghoshnaa kii, ''sankalp or prastaav paarit karne kaa samay ab biit gaya he
 Now is the time to take decisive action and give strong leadership to the country

 Mumbai was burning and they were hijacking to resign
 lekin mumbai kii tabaahi dekhte hue pichhali do raaton se jaag raheen congress adhyaksh unhen kshamaa karne ke mood main nahin thim
 Sonia was reflecting the mood of the CWC, which had made two demands - taking responsibility and taking action against Pakistan
 aisi baithkon main kuch na bolne ke liye jane jane vaale rahul gandhi kaa kahana tha, ''koi hamaare ghar main ghus aae, hamen thappad maare, isse sharmnaak cheez or kya hogi?'' jaahir he, ab nirnaayak karrwai karnaa hi ekmaatr vikalp tha or thake-maande, niskriy patil kii jagah kaam karke dikhaane vaale vitt mantri pi
 Chidambaram's appointment was the first step in the image improvement process

 But militant nationalism was such that some members even suggested military action against Pakistan
 aatankwaad ke khilaaf ladaai or khaskar pakistan ke khilaaf karrwai ne ab congressi agenda main majbootee se jagah bana lee he
 This is the reason why External Affairs Minister Pranab Mukherjee was not given the Home Ministry

 manmohan singh ne us mantralay kaa jimmaa liya, jise unhone kabhi badi dakshata se sambhala tha, yani vitt mantralay
 a Congress leader said, "earlier we had resented the rise in prices and terrorism, now with the Prime Minister handling the economy and Chidambaram becoming the head of the Home Ministry, we will win on both fronts
" ''lekin philhal, party mukhyalay se vah josh or utsaah nadaarad tha, jiske saath vah november ke shuru main vidhansabha chunaavon main utari thi
 At that time the party was confident of winning in Delhi, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh
 lekin mumbai visphoton ke baad ise bas rajasthan main jeet kii ummid he
 There is no talk of holding elections in February instead of April
 party ko arthvyavastha or suraksha ke muddon par kuch thos karne ke liye samay kii jarurat he
 The Prime Minister lost what he had earned on the nuclear deal with the US in one stroke
 mumbai visphoton se pehle bhi congress ko qaraar se chunavi laabh milane kar shankaaen thim
 Apart from Rahul Gandhi, no other leader raised this issue during the assembly elections
 lekin rojgaar guarantee yojana or kisaanon kaa karj maaf karne kii yojana kaaphi kargar rahi
 So expect the Congress to focus its campaign more on the nuclear deal
 or pakistan virdohi laffaaji par bhi
 Although the Congress is surrounded by problems, the opposition has not been able to save its reputation

 This was a disturbing development, due to which the two leaders were unable to tour the terror-stricken city together
 26 november ko jab adwani manmohan singh ke paas gaye or sankat kii ghadi main unhen bhaajapa ke aashwaasan kaa bharosa diya to pradhanmantri ne agle din saath mumbai chalane kaa prastaav unke saamne rakhaa
 Advani, who canceled the birthday celebrations of his wife, agreed to it
 agle din unhen centre se sandeshaa mila ki behatar hoga ve kisi or din daura karen kyonki aatankwaadiyon se nibatane kaa abhiyaan abhi puraa nahin hua he
 Advani, who is addressing public meetings in Rajasthan going to face assembly elections, could not change his schedule and go to Mumbai alone
 is bich varisht congress netaaon ne manmohan singh ko usee din mumbai jane kii salaah di taaki bhaajapa netaa is maamle main kahin unase baaji na maar len
 So, Prime Minister went to Mumbai with Sonia Gandhi
 adwani ne bhi vahaan unke saath hone kii peshkash kii, lekin use mana nahin gaya
 So in the end the two leaders came on the same day, but separately
 tab tak janata kaa mood is kadar netaa virdohi ho chukaa tha ki yah haal ke varshon main desh ke samaane sabase bade khatre kii ghadi main bhi rajnatik hdhaathamiktaaon or raajnneetik varchasv sthapit karne kaa ghatiya udhaaharan ban gaya

 The practice of giving money as an omen in weddings has been practiced for centuries
 duulhe ko neg dena ho yaa phir dulhan kii munh dikhaai ho, saaliyon ko juute churaane kaa shagun dena ho yaa phir nanad ko neg
 Apart from all these rituals, the guests coming to the wedding also like to give cash as an omen
 abnotbandi kii maarmarimen kyon na kuch aisa rasta nikaala jaae ki shagun bhi de diya jaae or cash kii killat se bhi bachaa sa sake
 Come, know some such new ideas that will give you a break from the omen
 
 
 
 1
 cash kii jagah den chemb jab chaaro taraf cash kaa akaal padaa he to kyon na chack ko istemaal kar liya jaae
 This is the best way to deal with the scarcity of cash and if seen it is also the safest
 cash to jitna haath main hoga kharch ho jaataa he lekin agar aap check shagun main dete hai to ye jarurat ke samay bhine jode kii madadkar saktaa he
 2
 neg ko kar den paytmpaytm ek tarah se cash hi hota he jo aapke wolet main nahin aapke mobile main sef rahata he to kyon 501-1001 kaa shagun lipaphe kii jagah paytm kar diya jaae
 It will definitely be useful for them in this hour of need
 3
 If a person is married to a person close to you online, then why not make a gift of their choice as an omen
 online aap unke liye shopping kar sakati hai
 This idea can become a great way to solve the problems of both your cash and your expenses

 The refuge of terrorism, Pakistan is constantly being isolated on the global stage
 ab uske sabase kareebi dost china ne bhi uskaa saath chhodane kaa man bana liya he
 The name of Pakistani terrorists was included in the BRICS manifesto, which all member countries including China had to support
 isamen kaha gaya ki aatanki gatividhiyon ko anjaam dene,aatankawadaprayojit karne or samarthan karne waalon ko iske liye jimmedaar tehraaya janaa chahie
 Fighting terrorism is an important duty of any nation

 It is okay that these issues are not discussed in elections and neither one loses the election on the question of education, but such information should be monitored

 Salman Khan is also active in the TV world

 But Salman Khan has been the host of Bigg Boss for more than a decade
 big bos logon ke bich coffee popular sho he or tiarapy main bhi unhen achche vyuj milte rahete hai

 ek top dephence export ne anumaan jataayaa he ki china aantarik asantosh, badhati berogari or vittiya samasyaon se apane logon kaa dhyaan bantane ke liye bharat par 2012 tak hamalaa kar saktaa he
 They believe that these problems are threatening the communists' hold on that country
 'indian dephence rivyuu' ke editor bharat verma ne kaha he ki 2012 se pehle china bharat par hamalaa karegaa
 There are many reasons for frustrated Beijing to teach India a final lesson through which it would like to ensure China's supremacy in Asia in this century
 unhone kaha ki mandi ne niryaat dukaanon ko band kar diya he jisase aantarik saamaajik ashaanti paidaa ho rahi he jo samaaj par communiston kii pakad ko gambhir khatra paidaa kar rahaa he
 Verma said in the editorial that the other reasons for this assessment are rising unemployment, hit billions of dollars worth of capital flight, depletion of its foreign exchange reserves and rising internal dissatisfaction
 unhone kaha ki iske atirikt china kii shah par bharat ke khilaaf kaam karne vaale unke daahine haath pakistan kii badhati apraasangikta china kii bechaini ko badha rahi he
 He said that the afghan-pak policy of US President Barack Obama is basically pak-afghan policy which has cleverly put the thief behind the thief
 verma ne kaha ki peiping ke saath apni nikatataa se pakistan pehle hi hilaa hua he, jo sahi myne main grihayuddh main fansaa hua he or bharat ke khilaaf ahmiyat kho rahaa he
 He said that the most important thing is that India's growing coordination with the US and the West is concerned
 unhone kaha ki chini communiston kii ye sabhi chintaaen shantivaadee bharat ke khilaaf yuddh se hi hal hoti he taaki bahuaiami ranneetik uddeshyon kii purti kii ja sake
 While China has allowed North Korea to carry out underground nuclear tests and missile tests in secret, it is also increasing its naval presence in the South China Sea to intimidate those opposing its claim to separate islands
 unhone kaha ki mandi prabhavit china ke liye is samay japan sahit pashchimi hiton ke khilaaf badhanaa samajhadaari nahin hogi
 Therefore, the most attractive option is to attack a soft target like India and forcibly occupy its land in the Northeast, but, India is less prepared at the ground level to face the Chinese threat

 The Indian Telecom Regulator (TRAI) has announced to make Do Not Disturb App mandatory in all smartphones in India
 android main aisa feechar pehle se hi he, lekin aipal ne ab tak aisa nahin kiya he
 Apple is known worldwide for its strictness regarding user privacy
 aise kai udhaaharan dekhne ko mili hai jab company ne america sarkaar se lekar FBI tak kii baat maanane se inkaar kiya he
 The company's reasoning behind this has been user privacy
 TRAI dwaara jari kiye gaye is nirdesh ke baad ab aipal TRAI ke is nae niyam ke khilaaf court ja sakati he
 Under this rule of TRAI, if a company did not put a Do Not Disturb App in its smartphone, then it will be closed
 ET ne sutron ke hawaale se ek report main kaha he ki aipal kemutabik TRAI dwaara laayaa gaya yah niyampane daayre main nahin he or iske liye aipal kanoonee sahaara le sakati he
 It is being told that TRAI cannot legally ask a telecom company to stop the service of a handset
 haalanki aipal ios ke agle varjan yani ios 12 software apadet main is tarah kaa feechar die jane kii ummid he jisase yugers anachaahe colls or massej ko report kar saken
 Apple has informed TRAI about this and it will be given to all eligible iphones by September
 TRAI ke is niyam kii vajah se hi yah khabaren aani shuru hui hai ki lakhon iphone band ho sakate hai
 Because at the moment Apple has not agreed to this rule of TRAI
 kya he TRAI kaa DND ap?bhartiya telecom regaulator yani TRAI ne DND kaa nayaa varjan laayaa he
 The regulator says that this app is built with intelligent features and has given intelligence spam detection for sms
 iske tahat yugers anachaahe colls or massej ko report kar sakate hai taaki aage se aisa na ho
 This app is of 10MB and the status of the complaint made by it can be tracked
 chunki yah ap colling or massej se judaa he, isliye is ap ko kol log or massej se lekar puure contacts tak acces chahie
 Why doesn't Apple want to install this app on your iphone? Apple is always strict about the privacy of the user
 america ke san barnadino ke shooter ke iphone knalock karne ke liye aipal ne FBI se lambii ladaai ladi or aakhirkaar aipal ne iphone analock nahin kiya
 There are many instances where Apple has shown strictness about user privacy
 TRAI ke is ap ko install karne ke liye yujar ko kai tarah ke parmishan dene hote hai
 This app can access your call logs, track SMS and contacts, read messages
 aam taur par is tarah ke eps android par kaam karte hai, lekin aipal aise eps ko apane iphone main ijaajat nahin detaa he
 What are the options? Apple has said, "after the arrival of ios 12, users can enable Unwanted Communication Extensions by going to Settings to report unwanted SMS messages and calls
 yugers ek baar ek hi anwonted communication ap ko aneble kar sakate hai
 To report calls, users must swipe left and report
 esemas ke liye report kaa feechar hoga jisase anachaahe massej kii shikaayat kii ja sakati he‚Äôab dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki kya TRAI aipal ke is jawaab ke baad apane niyam main koi badlaav karti he yaa phir iphone band honge

 If the past was divisive, this decision has paved the way for a new approach for India in which the expectations of the youth of the country have also been realized
 sabase acchhee baat yah he ki is faisle se kisi bhi paksh ko bahut zyada niraash hone kii jarurat nahin hogi
 This is a very balanced decision in which psychology has also contributed significantly
 There is no exaggeration
 chunki is faisle ne puri tarah se kisi ek paksh kaa samarthan nahin kiya he isliye yah apane aap main aisa faisla bhi nahin he jis nakara ja sake
 a kind of natural peace, and the absence of any kind of unpleasant news from anywhere, has proved that since 1992, there has been a generation of youth in India who have grown up in an environment of free economy and increasing employment in the country
 Let's look at the opportunities and those that mean more than the senses fluctuations
 aisa lagata he ki in logon ko isse koi matlab nahin rah gaya he ki babari masjid kii jagah koi ram mandir ban jaae
 Such youth no longer feel connected to such irrelevant history
 lekin 30 sitambar 2010 ke adalati faisle ne yah sabit kar diya ki ek loktantr, ek samaaj ke rup main ham itani tarakkee kar chuke hai ki ab aise maamle hamen nahin diga sakate
 After this decision, it has also been proved that our country will continue to move forward on a path of progress, forgetting the old things with far-sightedness

 The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has given its reply after the Election Commission's action on a complaint against the Namo TV channel
 bijepi ne bharosa diya he ki aage se channel par gaiyr-pramanit content nahin dikhaaya jayega
 a day after the Election Commission directed that all recorded programs shown on Namo TV not be shown without certification, Delhi Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) directed BJP not to broadcast any program on this channel without its approval
 Had given
 siio ne guuruuvaar ko kaha tha ki namo tivi bijepi chalaa rahi he, aise main prasaarit kiye jane vaale sabhi recorded kaaryakramon ko media pramann or dilli ke nigaraanee samiti dwaara purv pramanit kiya janaa chahie or purv-pramann ke bina pradarshit sabhi raajnneetik prachaar saamagree ko turant hataa diya janaa chahie

 aam chunaav kii tazaa khabaron se apadet rahane ke liesbscribakaren ajtak kaa ellection special newzlator Today is the birthday of writer Ravindra Kumar Pathak
 16 sitambar 1974 ko janmen rabindra kumaar pathak ne kaashi hindu vishvavidhyalay se padhai kii or ‚Äòhindi ke pramukh vyakaranon kaa samikshatmak anushilan'' vishay par shodh kiya
 Radhakrishna Prakashan has published his diary 'population Problem'
 is pustak main lekhak ne jansankhya-visphot ke peeche stri ke abalaakaran kii us aitihaasik-saanskrithik-saamaajik prakriyaan ko jimmedaar mana he, jo usase uski ‚Äòdeh‚Äô chhinakar, use prajnan kii gharelu-biimaar mashin banane ko abhishpt kar detii he
 This process is patriarchal, so this new way of public discourse is also an expose of the character of patriarchy which is the root source of the multiple deprivations of women - slaves and sufferings
 vivaah-sanstha or veshyavriti
 She has two hands, by clutching the woman, she transforms her from 'person' to 'body'
 jisase uske yon-shoshan ke raste prajnan kii baadhyataa paidaa hoti he
 The woman whose brunt suffers not only by losing her social life, career, honor, but also health and survival
 stri maa banati nahin, banaai jaati he, kyonki maatrutiv-kshamta or maa banane kii ichha main fark he
 Unlike the prevailing economic discourse, the work exposes the patriarchal boundaries of that discourse
 pustak anshah jansankhya samasyajansankhya-samasya kaa ab tak ek samgr nazariye se vivechna nahin ho paaya he
 i believe that there should be a complete historical-sociological-cultural-economic-psychological and biological discussion
 to isse stri-samasyaon kaa ek tarah se mukammal paath taiyaar ho jaataa he
 This does not mean that the discussion will have to be done in such a way that as a mother, the woman gave birth to the man and the same is created by the man by creating the socio-economic and cultural structure of his domination, then by creating an ideological framework and giving stability to that heterogeneous structure
 Birth mother, has put the woman in all kinds of pain, as Sahir Ludhianvi has felt - "woman gave birth to men, men Given the market
 jab ji chaha masalaa-kuchlaa,jab ji chaha dutkaar diya
 But, no
 hamen is darshanik se lagane vaale raste se vichaar karne kii jarurat nahin
 Although this path is not philosophical, it is based on concrete reality
 phir bhi,is sutaravat pankti main bina uljhe ham sidhe-sidhe bhi paa sakate hai ki jansankhya samasya kaa sampoorn vishleshan karnaa,darasal aurat kii tamaam samasyagrast duniya main pravesh karnaa he
 Then without solving this problem, the problems of the woman will not be able to be solved realistically, nor will she become a complete human being
 ab tak ke vishleshanon main is abhipraay kii tasviir ham sabane dekhi bhi he
 If we go into the early age, we will see that the efficiency and agility of a woman was nothing less than a man
 vah junglee jivan kaa yug tha
 The challenges and threats to life were the same for both and they were equally partners in dealing with them
 khaadya-sangrah or shikaar main donon samaan hissedaar the,atah samaan rup se unako pratishtha praapt thi
 However, the inferiority or slavery of women was planted at the very moment when the woman became pregnant for the first time
 us yug main sambhog va garbhaadhan kaa rishta atoot tha
 By the call of natural inspiration or body, men and women used to meet and enter the street of sexual relations
 kintu,is kriya main utarana tha ki stri kuch bandha si gai- garbhbhaar yukt hokar
 There was no way to avoid this
 garbhakalin boj sharir kaa bana bedaulapan or garbh-nirmaan kii prakriya se ho rahi poshak tattvon kii kami ne stri ko apane saamaanya sthiti ke saapeksh na ki aam purush ke saapeksh ablaa yaa alpabala bana diya
 Due to this short-sightedness and spontaneous affection towards the children born and falling in due care due to it, the female somatic possibility was limited and due to this, she fell a little behind in walking, step by step, shoulder to shoulder with the man
 
 is prakriya se stri ko praayah har varsh guzarana padataa tha- kyonki deh-sambandh prakritik prerana se chaalit tha or garbhaadhan se bache rahane kaa koi vigyaan tab na tha
 Secondly, like the rest of the animals, the season of conception was not even in humans
 salombar free license thi
 The result of all of this was that in economic and social processes, a woman, just like a man, lost her body-power again by connecting with the mind-power
 upar se garbhakaal kaal main vah purush saathi kii ore se di gai suraksha kii bhi mohataaj thi
 In addition to this, the ideology of woman's imperfection and her male-dependent, male-governed ideology emerged - which took root in the intellect of man and woman
 is idology ke parinamswaroop stri kii pratyaksh sthitiyaan or bhi badtar hoti gayi yani,jo kshamta bachi rahi,use bhi yah‚Äòvichaar‚Äôniyantrit karata gaya
 Then, with the worsening of this worsening situation, the idiology of female second-sex, second-sex, second-sex beings increased
 sab milakar, ‚Äòpurushatv‚Äôva‚Äòstritv‚Äônaamak do myth yaa saanskrithik kotiyaan- yani do gender sthapit hote gaye
 This 'gender-' distinction gradually developed with the development of civilization, and not only in social structure, economy, art-cultural and religious fields, but also in science-techniques that explored the physical features for life
 is bhed ne gyaan ke tamaam shastron va anushasano main apni upasthiti darj kii,kyonki pichad chuki stri shaastra-rachana main tanik bhi bhagidaar na thi
 When in every aspect of life, the woman was inferior to the man
 stri-deh ko apni jaagir maanane or uski shramashakti,prajnan-shakti va youniktaa kaa apane manamafik upyog karanevaali‚Äòpitrusatta‚Äôvivaah-sanstha va veshya tantra ke rup main udit ho chuki thi
 i clearly believe that the desire of the individual's right to the woman's body is the result of the institution of marriage and the desire of the collective right of the men on it is the result of the prostitute system
 antar sirf yahi he ki doosraa sirf usase ricriation yani anand chahta he
 The first one wants reproduction from her, children, reproduction etc
 stri kii sari gulaamiyon pidaaon kaa strot ye hi sansthaayen hai-‚Äòpitrusatta‚Äôke mukhya stambh ye hi hai
 This has crushed the woman's body by capturing all her personal possibilities, whether it is to become a strongman, sportsman, soldier, etc
 in the body, or to spread in the infinite forms of talent in the field of mind
 saath hi saath use jansankhya badhaane ke saadhan ke rup main dharamshastron dwaara adarshikrut ‚Äòmaa‚Äô, ‚Äòputravati‚Äô, ‚Äòsantaan yani putr uddeshy he byaah kaa‚Äôyaa‚Äòmaa bananaa hi stri kaa rin moksh‚Äôaadi naam-roopon main karke vyavhaar main use vaisaa banaaya bhi
 Thus, we found that the problem behind the rise of male authoritarian ideology and structure is population problem and the result of its rise is population growth
 stri-purush vaishamy yani pitrusattatmakataa keval ek saamaajik samasya nahin he,balki dher sari saamaajik samasyaon kii janani bhi he
 Then not only that
 nari kii durbalata yaa saamaajik hinata se vikaas-kaarykram asantulit hi nahin hote,balki vikaas kii gaadi bhi dhimi ho jaati he
 Dr
 amartya sen ne badi sateek vishleshan kar ise samajhaayaa he
 The most fatal result of the population problem has been the loss of the freedom of women
 jisase kai kaaryon ke sampaadan se vah vanchit rah jaati he
 Women have to lose their independent functionality while constantly lying in pregnancy and childbearing, but many times their life is also in serious danger from the delivery cycle

 ham in varshon main maanav antariksh mishan ke liye apni praudyogiki ko behatar karte rahe hai or isliye hamen vishwaas he ki hamaare liye 2022 kii jo samay seemaa tay kii gai he, usamen ham aisa karne main safal honge
 "the Prime Minister has named it Mission Gaganyaan and there are plans to send three Indians to the Earth's orbit for a week
" isro safal maanav antariksh mishan se antariksh mahashaktiyon kii us mandali main shaamil ho jayega, jisamen philhal america, rus or china (is vishesh club main shaamil hone vaala sabase nayaa) kii antariksh agenciyaan hi shumaar hai
 Since its inception in 1969, ISRO has performed in select public sector undertakings
 itane dashakon main isane antariksh-unmukh deshon ke liye aavashyak parishkrut or jatil rocket or upgrah praudyogiki main maharath hasil kar lee he
 Today, it excels in all major types of rockets ‚Äî solid-fuel, liquid-fuel or cryogenic-fuel rockets
 isane duniya ke kuch sabase baari launch vihical bhi taiyaar kiye hai
 It can also look forward to spectacular achievements such as setting up state-of-the-art and Indian-built Indian utilities for communication, meteorology, navigation and military needs, among many other types of tasks
 haal ke varshon main, yah chandramaa or mangal kii kaksha ke liye maanav rahit antariksh yaan bhejkar antariksh anveshan ke kshetra main pravesh kar chukaa he
 On Mars, it has the distinction of sending the spacecraft in its first attempt and at the lowest cost
 maanav antariksh mishan isro kii agali mahatvakanksha he
 This is an opportunity to build expertise in human space interfaces and is considered one of the most complex technologies in which ISRO has aimed for efficiency
 sivan kaa maananaa he ki yah bhartiya vigyaan or takneekee pragati ko kaaphi oonchai par le jayega
 He told India Today, "it is not just isro's project but it is a national project, because in this we will need many agencies, institutions and institutions
 unki dakshata, kshamta or takat se ham is abhiyaan ko safal bana sakenge
 "(see conversation) Nevertheless, many doubts have also been raised about the Government's thinking and intention behind the green signal for manned space mission
 unamem kuch uchit bhi lagate hai
 Eminent space scientist V
 siddharth ne kathith taur par bibisi se kaha, "antariksh main bharatiyon ko bhejnaa ajooba or bevakoofana vichaar he, khaskar nil armastrang ke chandramaa par utarane ke 50 saal baad
 "he argues: Apart from the risk involved in sending human beings, robotic missions can now do much more than anything an astronaut can do in space
 ek anya pratishthit antariksh or soochna praudyogiki visheshgy kiran kaarnik kaa kahana he ki is mishan ko pratishtha or gaurav ke saath jodgaye main raajnneeti zyada dikhti he
 He believes that manned space missions have meaning only if the motive is to avoid the devastation caused by catastrophic climate change or nuclear war, or to prepare for the long-term preparation to move industries harmful to the environment to the moon or other parts of the solar system
 Have a plan is bich, kharbapati nijee niveshkon ne bhi is kshetra main kadam rakh die hai, jo isro kii uplabdhiyon kii chamak ko kuch feekaa kar rahe hai
 Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic, Elon Musk's spacex and Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin have demonstrated superb space skills in a very short period of time
 spesex ko to neshnal aironautics and spes administration (nasa) kii ore se antarrashtriya antariksh stesan main pahunchane ke liye spes shatal kii jagah ek capsule viksit karne kaa order bhi mila he
 Tesla CEO Musk has announced his plans to send manned missions to Mars
 amejan ke sansthaapak or ab duniya ke sabase dhani vyakti bejos ne to blue origin ke lakshya ko jaahir karte hue kaha ki unki yojana he ki ab "lakhon log antariksh main hi nivas karen or vahiin se kaam karen
 "his company is building a rocket called New Shepard, which will have large windows, so that astrophysicists will be able to have a spectacular view
" or virgin galactic to ek up-kakshiya launture ko shuru karne ke kareeb he or maatr 2,50,000 dollar main yah logon ko antariksh kaa bhraman karaayega
 However, isro's partners are displeased with the comparison of India's space missions with these private enterprises or critics of India's space plans
 unka maananaa he ki isro ne pehle se hi technology kii ek vistrut shrunkhlaa viksit kii he jo maanav mishan kii laagat ko kam karti he
 The current estimate of the cost of this mission is Rs 10,000 crore
 kaa he, jise antarrashtriya str par aise udhyam kii laagat kaa aadha kaha jaataa he
 Governments of both the US and Russia have resumed plans to send humans into space, and China is also extending its plans
 isliye aisa nahin he ki robot jald hi puri tarah se manushyon kii jagah le legaa
 Sivan also says that ISRO has gradually engaged indigenous private industries in many of its technology and technology related work
 rocket launture ke 60 pratishat purje nijee airospes udhyamon dwaara nirmit kiye jate hai or upgrahon ke liye yah aankada 50 pratishat tak he
 He believes that the manned space mission will promote the industrial development of the country and will be the architect of the new technological revolution which will benefit the general public in the future
 mahatvapurn baat yah he ki agar atyaadhunik chunautiyaan na hon to isro ke vaigyanik is nae daur kii antariksh res main yaa to pichad jaaenge yaa phir sust pad jaaenge
 He says that the human mission will inspire more and more of our youth to come to science
 to, hamaare stri-purushon ko antariksh main bhejne ke liye kya chahie? pehali to, ise ek bade rocket kii aavashyaktaa hoti he jo saat maaruti-sujuki siaaj kaaron ke baraabar vajan vaale capsule ko uthaa sake
 In recent years, ISRO has upgraded its heavy lift launcher, the geo-synchronous satellite launch vehicle (GSLV) Mark 3
 lekin ise kaksha main bade upgrahon ko sthapit karne ke liye dizin kiya gaya he
 Now the rating of this launcher will be in the category of launcher shipped with INSAN
 isro ke purv adhyaksh ke
 Radhakrishnan explains that when you talk about manned space flight, the reliability of the launcher should be 98 percent or more
 yani, 100 launch main se keval do vifaltaaen hi maanya hongi
 To make the launcher fully successful, in addition to building it in all its important parts, ISRO will also have to make a lot of modifications to the Mark 3 launcher to make it a crew module (a module that includes crew members)
 Human beings can be seated in it
 yahaan tak ki launch pad main bhi sanshodhan karke use antariksh yaan ke saath gaye antariksh yatriyon (jinhen ho saktaa he ki "gagananots'' kaa naam mili) ke chalane-phirane laayak bananaa hoga
 Particularly important for ISRO would be to develop a crew escape system to be prepared to deal with any emergency situation after the launch phase
 aakhir, chaalak dal launch ke samay 200 ton se adhik atyadhik jvalansheel eendhan par baitha hoga; or yadi koi kharabi aati he, to unhen bijli kii gati se surakshit duuri par nikaal laane kii jarurat padegi
 In July this year, ISRO successfully tested such a system when a capsule weighing equal to space orbiters, including humans, was mounted on the Sriharikota Launchpad 2
 7 kimi kii oonchai par baahar nikaala gaya tha or phir parachute kaa upyog karke dhire-dhire neeche utaara gaya tha
 ISRO is also developing a special sensor that will be mounted on the rocket control system
 yah sensor kisi bhi tarah kii vifaltaa kii agrim chetavanee degaa or kru modul ko launture se baahar nikalne kaa cmand degaa
 The reliability of such a system should be rigorously tested
 500 launch main se maatr ek launch kii vifaltaa jaisi ucch dar kii vishwasaneeyata honi chahie
 The biggest challenge for ISRO will be to develop orbital modules and provide training to those who are running it in extreme conditions
 orbital modul ko do pranaaliyon main baanta gaya haih ek kru modul jisamen antariksh yatri hote hai, or ek sarvice modul jo solar cell se utpann bijli aapurti ke alaava rocket motors kaa upyog karke antariksh yaan kii gati or orientation ko banaae rakhata he
 Maintaining the internal environment in the crew module will be a major challenge to make it comfortable for three astronauts, during their one-week stay in space
 iske liye taapmaana ko 20 degree centegrade main banaae rakhane kii aavashyaktaa hogi, bhale hi bahari taapmaana shunya se 60 degree neeche yaa isse bhi kam ho
 Apart from this, the atmospheric pressure also has to be controlled as it runs at a speed of 7 km per second in orbit at an altitude of 400 km from the Earth
 vaigyanikon ko maanav apshisht ke prabandhan ke alaava, capsule main bhojan or pani ko store karne ke liye jagah bhi rakhni hogi‚Äîshunya gurutvkarshan main sab kuch tairta rahata he isliye pareshaani zyada hogi
 For the first flight, India can seek assistance from Russian or American space agencies that have expertise in managing manned space flights
 vaapasi yatra par, us sarvice modul ko jisamen motor modul rahata he, orbitor kii gati ko dhimaa karne ke liye upyog kiya jayega
 The angle of descent must be corrected before the crew can detach itself from the module
 sabase mahatvapurn kshan tab hota he jab kru modul, apni vaapasi yatra main prithvi ke vayumandal main phir se pravesh karata he
 It must then withstand temperatures as high as about 1000 degrees centigrade or boiling for steel
 isro ke vaigyanikon ne disambar 2014 main ek kru modul atomosphior ri-entry experiment (kear) kiya
 The crew mastered the technique of keeping the astronauts calm and safe during the module's re-entry into the atmosphere
 ek jieselvi rocket kaa upyog karke ek nakli chaalak dal modul ko bheja gaya tha or ise ucch taapmaana or gurutv-bal donon kaa anubhav karne ke liye banaaya gaya tha jiskaa ise apni vaapasi yatra main saamana karnaa hoga
 Its surface was coated with a coating of carbon composite tiles which enabled it to withstand extreme temperatures and dive into the Bay of Bengal without damage
 antariksh vaigyanikon ne 2007 main capsule recovery prayog ko pehle hi puraa kar liya tha, jisamen iske parachute khulenge jo ise samudr tat landing ke liye surakshit veg tak dhimaa kar denge
 They also tested recovery capability in the care experiment
 agle do varshon main, unhone ri-entry or recovery pranali ko apgrade karne par kaam kiya
 Of course, the biggest task for all will be the selection of astronauts who have the ability to control the situation even in difficult conditions and training after selection is also a big task
 rakesh sharma jaise bhartiya vaayu sena ke payalton kaa chayan karnaa ek vikalp to he
 But Sivan says that ISRO will conduct a massive search operation for this
 kareeb 500 ummidavaaron ko shortlist kiya jayega usamen se chantni ke baad sankhya ko 10 sadasyon tak simit kiye jane kii sambhaavna he or unhen prashikshit kiya jayega
 The training will teach them how to handle the gravity forces they can experience at launch and return journey and they will also be taught to work in zero gravity conditions
 bharat main aise kathor or vishisht prashikshan kii suvidha nahin he, jaise prashikshan ke liye centriphyus ji-force or shunya gurutvkarshan kii sthitiyon main vimaanon kii sthiti ke anuroop banane kii suvidha; unhen hasil karne main kuch saal or lagenge
 Sivan has indicated that for the first manned flight, ISRO may enlist the help of another country to train its astronauts
 ab antariksh yatriyon ke liye bhojan kii baat aati he, to bharat kii raksha prayogshaalaon ne sharma kii udaan ke liye bhojan taiyaar kiya tha
 The laboratories are ready to provide a superior menu with a distinct Indian flavor
 mishan main maanav jivan ke saath-saath desh kii pratishtha bhi daanv par hogi isliye isro bharat ke pehle maanav mishan ko har prakaar kii jokhim se mukt banane kii disha main kaam kar rahaa he
 They are aware of the deaths in space
 yahaan tak ki america main bhi kai pramukh durghatnaayen huin jisamen kalpana chawla samet kai antariksh yatri maare gaye the
 On its return journey in 2003, the space shuttle exploded and killed all six other crew, including Kalpana
 antariksh main antariksh yatriyon ko sachmuch bhejne se pehle dress reharsal honge jisamen sabhi taiyaariyon ke baad do maanavrahit mishan kiye jaaenge taaki sunishchit kiya ja sake ki sari taiyaariyaan thik hai or mishan ab apane saath maanvon ko le jane ke liye taiyaar he
 The first Indian manned mission is planned to be launched in December 2021
 "maine jab pehali baar prithvi kii kaksha se bharat ko dekha to mere bheetar saare jahaan se acha vaala bhav aayaa
 a few days later i realized from space that there are no geographical boundaries
 puri prithvi ek he
 "rakesh Sharma, the first Indian to go into space, India Today, April 30, 1984" One of the most amazing things I've felt when i am in zero gravity is when i want to sleep, i think That i have nothing but my thoughts to be felt because you are weightless, you do not feel your feet or your body

 Under which participation based communication is to be promoted

 Along with this, the Minister of Information and Broadcasting has strongly criticized some state governments for banning some television channels, strongly advocating freedom of press
 haalanki prakaash javdekar ne ‚Äòped news‚Äô kaa mudda bhi uthaaya or kaha ki maharashtra vidhansabha chunaav main yah buraai puure damakham ke saath maujuud dikhi
 Without mentioning the names of the states, Javadekar said that such a ban is against democratic principles and undermines the freedom of the press
 unhone kaha, ‚Äòaise do-teen rajya hai, jinhone ye pratibandh lagaae hai taaki ye channel cabel network main uplabdh nahin ho saken
 Media houses were threatened
 ‚Äôkendriya mantri ye tippanee us haalia ghatana ke maddenjar ai he jiske tahat do telugu channelon par telugana main pratibandh lagaaya tha

 Arvind Kejriwal has received a setback from the Supreme Court today in the Arun Jaitley defamation case
 supreme court ne kejariwal kii yachika khaarij kar di he
 a criminal defamation case will continue against him in Patiala House Court
 supreme court ne kaha aisa koi kanoon nahin he jo yah kahata ho ki civil or aapraadhik maamle ek saath nahin chal sakate
 It is also not a law that if the High Court gives an order in a civil case, then it will have an impact on the criminal case going on in the lower court
 kejariwal ke khilaaf dilli hoicourt main civil manahani or patiala house main aapraadhik manahani ke maamle chalate rahenge
 Advocate Ram Jethmalani, appearing on behalf of Kejriwal, said in the Supreme Court that if the two cases go together, then it will have to use double law in the same case
 agar hoicourt kaa faisla aa jaataa he to nichali adaalat us faisle se prabhavit hogi, isliye patiala house court main chal rahi aapraadhik karrwai par roak lagaai jaae

 Kejriwal had said in the petition filed in the High Court that criminal proceedings should be stayed due to two cases running simultaneously
 hoicourt main bhi jetali ne civil manahani kaa maamla daakhil kiya he
 The High Court said that a criminal case can continue in the trial court and there is no need to stop it due to a defamation case
 kejariwal ne kaha tha ki aapraadhik or civil cese saath-saath nahin chal sakate
 Civil case is going on in Delhi High Court, so the case should be stayed in the Magistrate Court
 gauratlab he ki kejariwal samet aam aadmi party ke paanch netaaon par jetali ne manahani kaa cese darj karaayaa tha
 These leaders had publicly accused Jaitley of corruption

 kejariwal kii ore se pesh vakil ram jethmalani ne supreme court main kaha agar donon cese ek saath chalenge to yah unke saath hi cese main doharaa kanoon istemaal karnaa hoga
 If the High Court verdict comes, the lower court will be affected by that decision, so the criminal proceedings underway in the Patiala House Court should be stayed

 23 may ko nattejey aane ke baad sakate main aae akhilesh yadav na to koi haar kii samiksha baithak kar paae or na hi haar ke nateezon kaa postmortem
 Now another problem has arisen in front of them
 samaajawaadee party ko loksabhaa main 5 siten mili hai
 Akhilesh Yadav from Azamgarh, Mulayam Singh Yadav from Mainpuri, Azam Khan from Rampur, Dr
 Hasan from Moradabad and Shafiqurrahman Burke from Sambhal
 17 june se loksabhaa kaa satr shuru ho rahaa he
 Before that, Akhilesh Yadav has to be elected as the leader of the parliamentary party in the Lok Sabha
 mulaayam singh ko sansadeey dal kaa netaa banaaya hi jayega lekin akhilesh yadav chif vip bane to unke kad ke mutabik nahin hoga or pita putr donon ke paas pad rahe to party main galat sandesh jayega
 Dr
 Hasan has become a Member of Parliament for the first time and Shafiqur Rahman is 92 years old
 kul milakar ajam khan ko chif vip bananaa pad saktaa he
 Now the difficulty is that with Mulayam Singh and Shafiqur Rahman being old, they cannot participate very actively in the proceedings of the Lok Sabha
 doctor hasan pehali baar hi jite hai to phir har mudde par party kaa loksabhaa main paksh rakhane ke liye akhilesh yadav ko khud satr main rahanaa padegaa
 If Azam Khan was given a chance, then in the current environment, the party should not have to suffer loss instead of profit
 isi dar se puure loksabhaa chunaav main ajam khan rampur ke alaava keval muradabad main hi party kaa prachaar karne gaye
 Akhilesh is in trouble
 17 june tak intjaar kariye ki loksabhaa main party ke kaddavar netaaon ke bich akhilesh apana kad kaise bachaate hai

 in / In the game of cricket, the work of wicketkeeper is very tiring
 yah thakaan us samay or bad jaati he jab aapako lagaataar kai over wicketcaping karne ke baad pari bhi shuru kerani pade
 Team India wicketkeeper Parthiv Patel had to go through a similar experience in the Chennai Test against England
 lagaataar haaavee hoti thakaan aapke puure sharir ko tod detii he or aapke riflaxes or running vitvin da wicket kaaphi dhimi ho jaati he, lekin parthiv ne apni jimmedaari ko bakhubi nibhaayaa or 150 se adhik over tak wicketcaping karne ke baad na keval bhartiya pari kii shuruyaat kii balki ardhashatak bhi banaaya
 In the Chennai Test, the batting of the first English team was dragged very long
 england kii pari match ke duusare din 157
 Finished for 477 runs after 2 overs
 cricket main sabase zyada thakaane vaala kaam wicketiper kaa hi hota he
 Other fielders are in a position to do some relays during this period, but the wicketkeeper has to keep a close eye on every ball
 kisi bhi gend par koi kaich yaa stamping miss hote hi maano uski puri mehnat par pani phir jaataa he
 The comments bataur wicketiper apni is jimmedaari ko team india ke 'chhutke' khilaadi ne bakhubi nibhaayaa
 He 157
 2 over tak wicket ke peeche apana kaam puri chaukasee se kiya or murali vijay ke chotil hone ke kaaran lokesh rahul ke saath ballebaaji kii bhi shuruyaat kii
 It was a work of praise after the tiring experience of wicketkeeping
 match ke duusare din parthiv 28 ran banaakar naabad the or team india kaa score bina wicket khoe 60 ran tha
 On the third day of the match, today Parthiv not only scored a half-century but also made a century partnership for Team India for the first time in the series
 parthiv ne lokesh rahul ke saath pehle wicket ke liye 152 ran jode
 Opening partnership has been a matter of concern for Team India in recent times and after 31 innings, there has been a century partnership for the first wicket in Test in India
 tisare din lunch ke kuch der pehle parthiv 71 ran banaakar out hue
 In a fascinating innings, he faced 112 balls and hit seven fours
 chennai test main pehle batting ko utari england team kii pari behad lambii khinch gai
 England's innings 157 on the second day of the match
 2 overs ke baad 477 ran par samaapt hui
 The most tiring task in cricket is that of the wicketkeeper
 duusare fielder to is dauraan kuch relex karne kii sthiti main hote hai lekin wicketiper ko har gend par baarik najar jamaakar rakhni hoti he
 As soon as there is a catch or stomping miss on any ball, it is as if all its hard work gets washed away
 tippaniyan Team India's 'chhutke' player performed this responsibility well as a wicketkeeper
 unhone 157
 He did his work with complete vigil behind the wicket for 2 overs and also started batting with Lokesh Rahul due to Murali Vijay's injury
 wicketcaping ke thakaa dene vaale anubhav ke baad yah vaaki prashansa ke laayak kaam tha
 Parthiv was unbeaten on 28 on the second day of the match and Team India's score was 60 runs without losing a wicket
 match ke tisare din, aaj parthiv ne na keval ardhashatak jamaaya balki siries main pehali baar team india ke liye shatkeey saajhedaari bhi kii
 Parthiv added 152 runs for the first wicket with Lokesh Rahul
 opening partnership haal ke samay main team india ke liye chintaa kaa vishay rahi he or 31 pari ke baad bharat kii ore se test main pehle wicket ke liye shatkeey saajhedaari hui he
 Parthiv was dismissed for 71 shortly before lunch on the third day
 aakarshak pari main unhone 112 gendon kaa saamana kiya or saat chauke lagaae

 vishwa doping nirodhi agency (wada) ne lans armsatrang se jude maamle kii jaanch kar rahi swatantra jaanch samiti ko union cyclist interneshonille (usiai) dwaara bhang kiye jane kii aalochana kii he or ise usiai kaa 'chaalaaki bharaa' kadam qaraar diya he
 Wada said on Wednesday that UCI has not discharged its responsibilities once again and has done a lot of wrongdoing by dissolving the committee investigating the case involving Lance
 tippaniyan The UCI said on Tuesday that it was dissolving the committee because it was not receiving any support from the US anti-doping Agency (USADA), which convicted Wada and Lance of consuming banned drugs
 isaki jagah usiai ne 'truth and rikanshiliation kamishan (tiarsi)' gathit karne kaa man banaaya he
 UCI has claimed that this new commission has the support of WADA chief John Fahey
 wada ne buudhvaar ko kaha ki usiai ne ek baar phir apni jimmedaariyon kaa nirvahan nahin kiya he or lans se jude maamle kii jaanch kar rahi samiti ko bhang karke bahut galat kaam kiya he
 The comments usiai ne mangalvaar ko kaha tha ki vah samiti ko isliye bhang kar rahi he kyonki use wada or lans ko pratibandhit dawaaon ke seven kaa doshi qaraar dene vaali america doping nirodhi agency (uasaidie) se kisi prakaar kaa sahyog nahin mil rahaa he
 Instead, UCI has decided to set up a 'truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC)'
 usiai ne daawa kiya he ki uske is nae kamishan kaa wada pramukh jon phahe kaa samarthan mila hua he

 bharat or america ke bich pragadh hoti dosti se china or pakistan pareshaan he ye to ek baat hui, lekin is dosti main aisa kya khaas he ki ham bilkul pareshaan nahin hai
 India and America have now come close to each other mentally and politically
 saavdhaanee baratane ke lihaaz se aap kah sakate hai ki pehle se kaaphi kareeb aa chuke hai
 So much so that some people in America and India came up with banner posters to support Donald Trump
 jo bhi he bharat or america ab apane is prem kaa izhaar public main koob kar rahe hai
 In Washington on Monday, India's Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar and US Defense Minister Aston Carter signed an agreement called LEMOA
 Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement
 Now the United States will be able to take help of India for the supply of fuel, repair of its fighters
 bharat bhi america se madad le sakegaa
 a joint statement issued on the occasion stated that the agreement would provide additional opportunities for practical exchanges
 sunne main to yah pankti behad saral he magar bina detail ke aapako isse kuch bhi pataa nahin lagegaa
 The Defense Minister said that neither of them was obliged to provide logistic support due to the agreement
 har cese main donon pakshon ko alag se manzuri leni padegi
 Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar has said that there is no provision for building a military base in the logistics agreement between India and America
 yah unka bayaan he na ki samjhaute kii copy kaa detail saarvajanik hua he
 There is a great difference between the two will not build military bases and military bases can be used
 donon ke apane-apane khatre or kuubiyaan hongi
 In the Express, Sushant Singh has written that the Defense Minister has told an American journalist that he will first make the details of this agreement public and see what the reaction of the people is
 dashakon se ham america ke partner he hin
 Have already come closer
 lekin in samjhauton ke zarie partner hone kaa kya matlab he
 Just keep googleing that by becoming a partner of America, which country is such a country which has become super power in its area
 jamaane tak pakistan ko america kaa kareebi bataaya jaataa rahaa he, is kram main or bhi deshon ke naam liye ja sakate hai
 Has China also become powerful as a partner of America
 baharhaal bharat, america ke saath chaar buniyadi samjhaute karne vaala he
 These four agreements will complete the relationship between the two countries in the military field
 in chaar main se ek he LEMOA
 India has signed two out of four
 pehla he, general secority of military information agreement (GSOMIA), 2002 main bharat ne is par dastakhat kar diya tha
 Second is Logistic Exchange Memorandum Agreement LEMOA Third is Communications and Information Security Memorandum of Agreement (CISMOA) Fourth is Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement (BECA) research ke dauraan padhane ko mila ki 2002 main pehle samjhaute par dastakhat karne ke baad vaajapeyi sarkaar or manmohan sarkaar duusare, tisare or chauthe samjhaute par dastakhat karne ko lekar bahut utsahit nahin thi
 It was feared that India should not go into the arms of America
 somvaar ko washington se jari saajha bayaan main kaha gaya he ki donon deshon ne bharat ko pramukh raksha sahyogi kii padavi dene par bhi charchaa kii, jiskaa elaan isi june main pradhanmantri modi kii america yatra ke dauraan hua tha
 This visit by the Defense Minister of India shows how much importance both sides attach to defense relations in many areas
 ranneetik saajhedaari or kshetreey sahyog badhaane ke alaava ek-duusare ke sainikon ke aadan pradaan, raksha takanic or khoj main bhi sahyog badhanaa chaahate hai
 After this agreement, the US has agreed to elevate India's status in defense technology and trade
 wo ab un chizon ko saajha karegaa jo abhi tak sirf apane kareebi saajhedaaron or hissedaaron se karata aayaa he
 India has recently become a member of Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) due to America, which was well praised by defense experts of India
 saajha bayaan main bataaya gaya he ki nau sena, vaayu sena, khufia system ke kshetra main donon ke bich kai tarah ke qaraar hue hai
 The US will also help in enhancing India's nine military capabilities
 nau sainik or sainik abhyaas to donon mulkon ke bich hote hi rahete hai
 There has also been talk of mutual understanding and enhancement in the matter of military services
 somvaar ko hue samjhaute ke baad kaha ja rahaa he ki bharat or america ke aapasi rishte main kaaphi bada badlaav aa chukaa he
 This change was coming from the 90s but in the field of economic policies, but recently this friendship has also turned towards defense business and partnership
 itani tezi se ye badlaav aayaa he ki vajayapi or manmohan ke pandrah-solah saal main jo na ho sakaa wo do-teen maheene main ho gaya
 We have studied only the material available in the media about this agreement
 manmohan singh ne bhi newclear deal ke samay apni sarkaar daanv par laga di thi, us deal kaa nateeja aaj tak aana baaki he
 Within two years, the Modi government has confidently extended its hand to the United States
 par aisa nahin lagata ki ashankaon ko ekadam se darkinar kar diya he
 In the Express, Sushant Singh has written that this is why Defense Minister Parrikar got a lot of amendments done in Limoa, while it has a fixed draft on which America has entered more than 100 such agreements with many countries
 is qaraar se badi baazi america ne maari he yaa donon ke bich baraabar kaa qaraar hua he
 The comments dilli main america ke videsh mantri jon kairi hai
 He said on Tuesday evening that the two countries have never been so close to each other in history
 kairi ne kaha ki isamen koi shaq nahin ki hakkaani network or lashkar-e-taiyaba pakistan se hi kaam karte hai
 But at the same time, he quoted talks with Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and his army chief Rahil Sharif, saying that Pakistan has given assurance of action to the terrorists, which takes some time
 ek tarah se kairi ne pakistani sarkaar kaa bachaav kar diya
 India's defense minister is in the US
 dilli main bhi bharat or america ke bich do dinon main kaaphi gatividhiyaan hui hai
 Diplomatic and strategic relationships change according to the need of the hour
 kya ham vakt ke usee muhane par khadey hokar yah nazaaraa dekh rahe hai yaa kisi aane vaale nateezon se anjaan swaagat karne main lage hai
 It should not also be that we should remain unaware of its smell, but the whole evening is spent in happiness, this is also not right
 duusari taraf ise lekar china or pakistan kyon pareshaan hai
 Why is it being said in Pakistan's media that Pakistan should make such an agreement with China
 china kii media main kyon kaha ja rahaa he ki bharat amareeki qaraar se pakistan or china chidh sakate hai
 Should India not make any move with this logic, is it appropriate? bharat america ke upar likhane vaale do chaar niyamit jaankaron ko padhate hue laga ki ve is samjhaute se kaaphi prabhavit hai
 M
 ke
 Bhadrakumar who is a former diplomat has raised some questions in his article
 unhone kaha he ki India has never allowed any foreign power to use its military bases
 kisi gut kaa hissaa hone se bachane ke liye or ranneetik swaittata banaae rakhi
 It will have to be seen whether India will use more American facilities or America will use Indian facilities
 simit research ke dauraan pataa chalaa ki america kaa bharat ke aasapaas ke ilaake main tamaam adde hai
 Pakistan, Afghanistan, Central Asia, Iran are everywhere
 singapore, philippinos, australia, dakshin korea or japan main bhi uske adde hai
 All the bases in the Gulf countries are built, where hundreds of its fighters, aircraft carriers, thousands of soldiers are stationed
 phir bhi use bhartiya suvidhaon ke istamaal karne kii bechaini kyon he
 Why are they historical for him? kya isliye ki bharat kareeb aayaa he yaa isliye aitihaasik he ki aas paas ab har jagah thikaana ho gaya tha magar bharat hi rah gaya tha
 It is sure that since Limoa bharat vayusena or nau sena ke liye america se atyaadhunik technology kareed sakegaa
 The company making the F-16 can now make this aircraft in India as well
 lekin padhane ko mila ki yah company turki ke ankara main bhi banaati he
 It was also found that the F-16 is now outdated, so it is being removed from the US
 epa-16 banane vaali company lokaheed martin kor epa-35 bana rahi he
 M
 ke
 Bhadrakumar has written that why Prime Minister Modi will accept F-16, if F-35 state-of-the-art fighter aircraft has come in the market
 unka yah bhi sawaal he ki kya ham america ke bharose china kii barabari kaa sapana dekh rahe hai
 This should not make Pakistan and China closer to each other
 bhadrakumar kii ashanka ko jagah isliye di kyonki aapako bataaya hi ki zyaadaatar log isaki tarif kar rahe hai
 If India and the United States are so close together, then we too will see this history today
 somvaar ko washington main bharat ke raksha mantri manohar parrikar or america ke raksha mantri eston carter ne ek samjhaute par dastakhat kiye, jise LEMOA kehete hai
 Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement
 ab america apane ladaaku vimaanon kii marammat, eendhan kii aapurti ke liye bharat kii madad le sakegaa
 India will also be able to get help from America
 is maukey par jari saajha bayaan main kaha gaya he ki yah samjhauta vyaavhaarik aadan-pradaan ke liye atirikt avasaron ko uplabdh karaayega
 This line is very easy to hear, but without detail, you will not know anything from it
 raksha mantri ne kaha ki samjhaute ke kaaran lagistic saport dene ke liye donon main se koi bhi baadhya nahin he
 In each case, both sides will have to take a separate approval
 raksha mantri manohar parrikar ne kaha he ki bharat or america ke bich logistic ko lekar jo qaraar hua he, usamen sainik adda banane kaa koi praavdhaan nahin he
 This is his statement and not the details of the copy of the agreement has been made public
 sainik adda nahin banaaenge or sainik addon kaa istemaal kiya ja sakegaa donon main bahut antar he
 Both will have their own dangers and threats
 express main sushant singh ne likhaa he ki raksha mantri ne ek amareeki patrkaar ko kaha he ki pehle ve is samjhaute kii detail saarvajanik karenge or dekhenge ki logon kii pratikriya kya he
 We have been partners of America for decades
 kareeb aa hi chuke hai
 But what does it mean to be a partner through these agreements? bas ye google karte rahen ki america kaa partner banakar duniya main koun sa aisa mulk he jo apane ilaake main super power hua he
 For the time being Pakistan is said to be close to America, in this order more countries can be named
 kya china bhi america kaa partner banakar shaktishaalee bana he
 However, India is going to have four basic agreements with the US
 ye chaaron samjhaute donon mulkon kii sainya kshetra main rishtedaari ko mukammal kar denge
 One of these four is LEMOA
 bharat ne chaar main se do par dastakhat kar die hai
 The first is, India signed it in 2002 by the General Security of Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA)
 doosraa he logistic exange memorondom agreement lemoawisara he communications and information security memorondom of agreement (cismoa)chauthaa he basic exange and copereshan agreement (BECA) During research, it was found that after signing the first agreement in 2002, the Vajpayee government and the Manmohan government were not very enthusiastic about signing the second, third and fourth agreement
 ashanka thi ki bharat america kii baahon main na chalaa jaae
 In a joint statement issued from Washington on Monday, the two countries also discussed giving India the title of a key defense partner, which was announced during Prime Minister Modi's visit to the US this June
 bharat ke raksha mantri kaa yah daura bataata he ki donon paksh kai kshetron main raksha sambandhon ko kitni ahmiyat dete hai
 Apart from enhancing strategic partnership and regional cooperation, they also want to increase cooperation in exchange of each other's troops, defense techniques and search
 is samjhaute ke baad america, bharat ko raksha takanic or vyapaar main bharat ke darje ko ooncha karne ke liye taiyaar ho gaya he
 He will now share the things that he has done so far with only his close partners and stakeholders
 america ke kaaran bharat haal hi main Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) kaa sadsy hua he, jisaki bharat ke raksha visheshgyon ne koob tarif kii thi
 The joint statement said that there have been many agreements between the two in the field of the Navy, Air Force and Intelligence Systems
 america bharat kii nau sainik kshamtaaon ko badhaane main bhi madad karegaa
 Nine soldiers and military exercises continue between the two countries
 sainik sevaaon ke maamle main aapasi samaj or badhaane par bhi baat hui he
 After the agreement reached on Monday, it is being said that there has been a big change in the relationship between India and America
 yah badlaav 90 ke dashak se aa rahaa tha magar aarthik nitiyon ke kshetra main, lekin haal philhal main yah dosti raksha kaarobaar or saajhedaari kii taraf bhi mudi he
 This change has happened so fast that what could not happen in fifteen-sixteen years of Vajpayee and Manmohan happened in two-three months
 hamane is samjhaute ke bare main media main uplabdh saamagree kaa hi adhyayan kiya he
 Manmohan Singh had also placed his government at stake at the time of nuclear deal, the result of that deal is yet to come
 do saal ke bheetar modi sarkaar ne aatmavishvaas ke saath america kii taraf haath badhaayaa he
 But it does not seem that the fears have been completely ignored
 express main sushant singh ne likhaa he ki isi kaaran raksha mantri parrikar ne limoa main kaaphi kuch sanshodhan karavaaya, jabaki iskaa ek tay draft hota he jis par america ne kai deshon ke saath 100 se adhik aise samjhaute kiye hai
 The United States has won a great deal with this agreement or an equal agreement has been reached between the two
 tippaniyan US Secretary of State John Carrey is in Delhi
 unhone mangalvaar kii shaam kaha ki itihaas main donon desh ek-duusare ke itane kareeb kabhi nahin rahe
 Carrie said that there is no doubt that the Haqqani network and lashkar-e-taiba operate from Pakistan
 lekin saath hi unhone pakistani pradhanmantri nawaz shareef or vahaan ke senapramukh raahil shareef se hui baatcheet kaa hawala dete hue kaha ki pakistan ne aatankiyon par karrwai kaa bharosa diya he, jisamen thodaa vaqt lagata he
 In a way, Kerry defended the Pakistani government
 america main bharat ke raksha mantri hai
 In Delhi too, there has been a lot of activity between India and USA in two days
 vakt kii zarurat ke hisaab se kootnithik or ranneetik sambandh badalte hai
 Are we standing at the same mouth of the time watching this scene or are we beginning to welcome unknown results
 yah bhi nahin hona chahie ki ham isaki kushbu se anjaan rah jaaen lekin khushrahami main hi puri shaam guzar jaae, yah bhi thik nahin he
 On the other hand, why China and Pakistan are worried about it
 pakistan kii media main kyon kaha ja rahaa he ki pakistan ko china ke saath aisa qaraar kar lenaa chahie
 Why is it being said in Chinese media that Pakistan and China can irritate India with the US agreement
 is tark se bharat koi kadam hi na badaye kya yah uchit hoga
 India, reading two of the four regular writers who wrote above America, felt that they were greatly influenced by this agreement
 em
 K
 bhadrakumar hai jo purv rajaniyak hai unhone apane lekh main kuch sawaal uthaae hai
 They said that bharat ne kabhi kisi videshi shakti ko apane sainik addon kaa istamaal karne nahin diya he
 Maintained strategic autonomy to avoid being part of any faction
 dekhnaa hoga ki bharat amareeki suvidhaon kaa istamaal zyaada karegaa yaa america bharat kii suvidhaon kaa
 During limited research, it was found that America has many bases in the vicinity of India
 pakistan, afghanistan, madhya asia, iran har jagah hai
 It also has bases in Singapore, Philippines, Australia, South Korea and Japan
 khadi ke deshon main tamaam adde bane hai, jahaan uske sainkadon ladaaku vimaan, vimanavahak pot, hazaron sainik tainaat hai
 Still why does he have discomfort to use Indian facilities
 uske liye ye aitihaasik kyon hai
 Is it because India has come close or because it is historical that there was a hideout everywhere around now but India remained
 yah zarur he ki limoa ke baad se India will be able to purchase state-of-the-art technology from the US for the Air Force and Navy
 epa-16 banane vaali company ab yah vimaan bharat main bhi bana sakati he
 But it was read that this company also manufactures in Ankara, Turkey
 yah bhi mila ki epa-16 ab purana ho gaya he, isliye use america se hataaya ja rahaa he
 The company making the F-16 is making the Lockheed Martin Corps F-35
 em
 K
 bhadrakumar ne likhaa he ki pradhanmantri modi epa-16 kyon sweekaar karenge, agar epa-35 atyaadhunik ladaaku vimaan market main aa gaya he to
 He also has a question whether we are dreaming of China's equality with America
 kahin isse pakistan or china ek duusare ke or kareeb na aa jaaen
 Bhadrakumar's apprehension was given because he told you that most people are praising it
 agar bharat or america kaa itnaa qareeb aana aitihaasik he to ham bhi is itihaas ko aaj qareeb se dekhenge
 In each case, both sides will have to take a separate approval
 raksha mantri manohar parrikar ne kaha he ki bharat or america ke bich logistic ko lekar jo qaraar hua he, usamen sainik adda banane kaa koi praavdhaan nahin he
 This is his statement and not the details of the copy of the agreement has been made public
 sainik adda nahin banaaenge or sainik addon kaa istemaal kiya ja sakegaa donon main bahut antar he
 Both will have their own dangers and threats
 express main sushant singh ne likhaa he ki raksha mantri ne ek amareeki patrkaar ko kaha he ki pehle ve is samjhaute kii detail saarvajanik karenge or dekhenge ki logon kii pratikriya kya he
 We have been partners of America for decades
 kareeb aa hi chuke hai
 But what does it mean to be a partner through these agreements? bas ye google karte rahen ki america kaa partner banakar duniya main koun sa aisa mulk he jo apane ilaake main super power hua he
 For the time being Pakistan is said to be close to America, in this order more countries can be named
 kya china bhi america kaa partner banakar shaktishaalee bana he
 However, India is going to have four basic agreements with the US
 ye chaaron samjhaute donon mulkon kii sainya kshetra main rishtedaari ko mukammal kar denge
 One of these four is LEMOA
 bharat ne chaar main se do par dastakhat kar die hai
 The first is, India signed it in 2002 by the General Security of Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA) 
 doosraa he logistic exange memorondom agreement lemoawisara he communications and information security memorondom of agreement (cismoa)chauthaa he basic exange and copereshan agreement (BECA) During research, it was found that after signing the first agreement in 2002, the Vajpayee government and the Manmohan government were not very enthusiastic about signing the second, third and fourth agreement
 ashanka thi ki bharat america kii baahon main na chalaa jaae
 In a joint statement issued from Washington on Monday, the two countries also discussed giving India the title of a key defense partner, which was announced during Prime Minister Modi's visit to the US this June
 bharat ke raksha mantri kaa yah daura bataata he ki donon paksh kai kshetron main raksha sambandhon ko kitni ahmiyat dete hai
 Apart from enhancing strategic partnership and regional cooperation, they also want to increase cooperation in exchange of each other's troops, defense techniques and search
 is samjhaute ke baad america, bharat ko raksha takanic or vyapaar main bharat ke darje ko ooncha karne ke liye taiyaar ho gaya he
 He will now share the things that he has done so far with only his close partners and stakeholders
 america ke kaaran bharat haal hi main Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) kaa sadsy hua he, jisaki bharat ke raksha visheshgyon ne koob tarif kii thi
 The joint statement said that there have been many agreements between the two in the field of the Navy, Air Force and Intelligence Systems
 america bharat kii nau sainik kshamtaaon ko badhaane main bhi madad karegaa
 Nine soldiers and military exercises continue between the two countries
 sainik sevaaon ke maamle main aapasi samaj or badhaane par bhi baat hui he
 After the agreement reached on Monday, it is being said that there has been a big change in the relationship between India and America
 yah badlaav 90 ke dashak se aa rahaa tha magar aarthik nitiyon ke kshetra main, lekin haal philhal main yah dosti raksha kaarobaar or saajhedaari kii taraf bhi mudi he
 This change has happened so fast that what could not happen in fifteen-sixteen years of Vajpayee and Manmohan happened in two-three months
 hamane is samjhaute ke bare main media main uplabdh saamagree kaa hi adhyayan kiya he
 Manmohan Singh had also placed his government at stake at the time of nuclear deal, the result of that deal is yet to come
 do saal ke bheetar modi sarkaar ne aatmavishvaas ke saath america kii taraf haath badhaayaa he
 But it does not seem that the fears have been completely ignored
 express main sushant singh ne likhaa he ki isi kaaran raksha mantri parrikar ne limoa main kaaphi kuch sanshodhan karavaaya, jabaki iskaa ek tay draft hota he jis par america ne kai deshon ke saath 100 se adhik aise samjhaute kiye hai
 The United States has won a great deal with this agreement or an equal agreement has been reached between the two
 tippaniyan US Secretary of State John Carrey is in Delhi
 unhone mangalvaar kii shaam kaha ki itihaas main donon desh ek-duusare ke itane kareeb kabhi nahin rahe
 Carrie said that there is no doubt that the Haqqani network and lashkar-e-taiba operate from Pakistan
 lekin saath hi unhone pakistani pradhanmantri nawaz shareef or vahaan ke senapramukh raahil shareef se hui baatcheet kaa hawala dete hue kaha ki pakistan ne aatankiyon par karrwai kaa bharosa diya he, jisamen thodaa vaqt lagata he
 In a way, Kerry defended the Pakistani government
 america main bharat ke raksha mantri hai
 In Delhi too, there has been a lot of activity between India and USA in two days
 vakt kii zarurat ke hisaab se kootnithik or ranneetik sambandh badalte hai
 Are we standing at the same mouth of the time watching this scene or are we beginning to welcome unknown results
 yah bhi nahin hona chahie ki ham isaki kushbu se anjaan rah jaaen lekin khushrahami main hi puri shaam guzar jaae, yah bhi thik nahin he
 On the other hand, why China and Pakistan are worried about it
 pakistan kii media main kyon kaha ja rahaa he ki pakistan ko china ke saath aisa qaraar kar lenaa chahie
 Why is it being said in Chinese media that Pakistan and China can irritate India with the US agreement
 is tark se bharat koi kadam hi na badaye kya yah uchit hoga
 India, reading two of the four regular writers who wrote above America, felt that they were greatly influenced by this agreement
 em
 K
 bhadrakumar hai jo purv rajaniyak hai unhone apane lekh main kuch sawaal uthaae hai
 They said that bharat ne kabhi kisi videshi shakti ko apane sainik addon kaa istamaal karne nahin diya he
 Maintained strategic autonomy to avoid being part of any faction
 dekhnaa hoga ki bharat amareeki suvidhaon kaa istamaal zyaada karegaa yaa america bharat kii suvidhaon kaa
 During limited research, it was found that America has many bases in the vicinity of India
 pakistan, afghanistan, madhya asia, iran har jagah hai
 It also has bases in Singapore, Philippines, Australia, South Korea and Japan
 khadi ke deshon main tamaam adde bane hai, jahaan uske sainkadon ladaaku vimaan, vimanavahak pot, hazaron sainik tainaat hai
 Still why does he have discomfort to use Indian facilities
 uske liye ye aitihaasik kyon hai
 Is it because India has come close or because it is historical that there was a hideout everywhere around now but India remained
 yah zarur he ki limoa ke baad se India will be able to purchase state-of-the-art technology from the US for the Air Force and Navy
 epa-16 banane vaali company ab yah vimaan bharat main bhi bana sakati he
 But it was read that this company also manufactures in Ankara, Turkey
 yah bhi mila ki epa-16 ab purana ho gaya he, isliye use america se hataaya ja rahaa he
 The company making the F-16 is making the Lockheed Martin Corps F-35
 em
 K
 bhadrakumar ne likhaa he ki pradhanmantri modi epa-16 kyon sweekaar karenge, agar epa-35 atyaadhunik ladaaku vimaan market main aa gaya he to
 He also has a question whether we are dreaming of China's equality with America
 kahin isse pakistan or china ek duusare ke or kareeb na aa jaaen
 Bhadrakumar's apprehension was given because he told you that most people are praising it
 agar bharat or america kaa itnaa qareeb aana aitihaasik he to ham bhi is itihaas ko aaj qareeb se dekhenge
 In the Express, Sushant Singh has written that the Defense Minister has told an American journalist that he will first make the details of this agreement public and see what the reaction of the people is
 dashakon se ham america ke partner he hin
 Have already come closer
 lekin in samjhauton ke zarie partner hone kaa kya matlab he
 Just keep googleing that by becoming a partner of America, which country is such a country which has become super power in its area
 jamaane tak pakistan ko america kaa kareebi bataaya jaataa rahaa he, is kram main or bhi deshon ke naam liye ja sakate hai
 Has China also become powerful as a partner of America
 baharhaal bharat, america ke saath chaar buniyadi samjhaute karne vaala he
 These four agreements will complete the relationship between the two countries in the military field
 in chaar main se ek he LEMOA
 India has signed two out of four
 pehla he, general secority of military information agreement (GSOMIA), 2002 main bharat ne is par dastakhat kar diya tha
 Second is Logistic Exchange Memorandum Agreement LEMOA Third is Communications and Information Security Memorandum of Agreement (CISMOA) Fourth is Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement (BECA) research ke dauraan padhane ko mila ki 2002 main pehle samjhaute par dastakhat karne ke baad vaajapeyi sarkaar or manmohan sarkaar duusare, tisare or chauthe samjhaute par dastakhat karne ko lekar bahut utsahit nahin thi
 It was feared that India should not go into the arms of America
 somvaar ko washington se jari saajha bayaan main kaha gaya he ki donon deshon ne bharat ko pramukh raksha sahyogi kii padavi dene par bhi charchaa kii, jiskaa elaan isi june main pradhanmantri modi kii america yatra ke dauraan hua tha
 This visit by the Defense Minister of India shows how much importance both sides attach to defense relations in many areas
 ranneetik saajhedaari or kshetreey sahyog badhaane ke alaava ek-duusare ke sainikon ke aadan pradaan, raksha takanic or khoj main bhi sahyog badhanaa chaahate hai
 After this agreement, the US has agreed to elevate India's status in defense technology and trade
 wo ab un chizon ko saajha karegaa jo abhi tak sirf apane kareebi saajhedaaron or hissedaaron se karata aayaa he
 India has recently become a member of Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) due to America, which was well praised by defense experts of India
 saajha bayaan main bataaya gaya he ki nau sena, vaayu sena, khufia system ke kshetra main donon ke bich kai tarah ke qaraar hue hai
 The US will also help in enhancing India's nine military capabilities
 nau sainik or sainik abhyaas to donon mulkon ke bich hote hi rahete hai
 There has also been talk of mutual understanding and enhancement in the matter of military services
 somvaar ko hue samjhaute ke baad kaha ja rahaa he ki bharat or america ke aapasi rishte main kaaphi bada badlaav aa chukaa he
 This change was coming from the 90s but in the field of economic policies, but recently this friendship has also turned towards defense business and partnership
 itani tezi se ye badlaav aayaa he ki vajayapi or manmohan ke pandrah-solah saal main jo na ho sakaa wo do-teen maheene main ho gaya
 We have studied only the material available in the media about this agreement
 manmohan singh ne bhi newclear deal ke samay apni sarkaar daanv par laga di thi, us deal kaa nateeja aaj tak aana baaki he
 Within two years, the Modi government has confidently extended its hand to the United States
 par aisa nahin lagata ki ashankaon ko ekadam se darkinar kar diya he
 In the Express, Sushant Singh has written that this is why Defense Minister Parrikar got a lot of amendments done in Limoa, while it has a fixed draft on which America has entered more than 100 such agreements with many countries
 is qaraar se badi baazi america ne maari he yaa donon ke bich baraabar kaa qaraar hua he
 The comments dilli main america ke videsh mantri jon kairi hai
 He said on Tuesday evening that the two countries have never been so close to each other in history
 kairi ne kaha ki isamen koi shaq nahin ki hakkaani network or lashkar-e-taiyaba pakistan se hi kaam karte hai
 But at the same time, he quoted talks with Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and his army chief Rahil Sharif, saying that Pakistan has given assurance of action to the terrorists, which takes some time
 ek tarah se kairi ne pakistani sarkaar kaa bachaav kar diya
 India's defense minister is in the US
 dilli main bhi bharat or america ke bich do dinon main kaaphi gatividhiyaan hui hai
 Diplomatic and strategic relationships change according to the need of the hour
 kya ham vakt ke usee muhane par khadey hokar yah nazaaraa dekh rahe hai yaa kisi aane vaale nateezon se anjaan swaagat karne main lage hai
 It should not also be that we should remain unaware of its smell, but the whole evening is spent in happiness, this is also not right
 duusari taraf ise lekar china or pakistan kyon pareshaan hai
 Why is it being said in Pakistan's media that Pakistan should make such an agreement with China
 china kii media main kyon kaha ja rahaa he ki bharat amareeki qaraar se pakistan or china chidh sakate hai
 Should India not make any move with this logic, is it appropriate? bharat america ke upar likhane vaale do chaar niyamit jaankaron ko padhate hue laga ki ve is samjhaute se kaaphi prabhavit hai

 Bhadrakumar who is a former diplomat has raised some questions in his article
 unhone kaha he ki India has never allowed any foreign power to use its military bases
 kisi gut kaa hissaa hone se bachane ke liye or ranneetik swaittata banaae rakhi
 It will have to be seen whether India will use more American facilities or America will use Indian facilities
 simit research ke dauraan pataa chalaa ki america kaa bharat ke aasapaas ke ilaake main tamaam adde hai
 Pakistan, Afghanistan, Central Asia, Iran are everywhere
 singapore, philippinos, australia, dakshin korea or japan main bhi uske adde hai
 All the bases in the Gulf countries are built, where hundreds of its fighters, aircraft carriers, thousands of soldiers are stationed
 phir bhi use bhartiya suvidhaon ke istamaal karne kii bechaini kyon he
 Why are they historical for him? kya isliye ki bharat kareeb aayaa he yaa isliye aitihaasik he ki aas paas ab har jagah thikaana ho gaya tha magar bharat hi rah gaya tha
 It is sure that since Limoa bharat vayusena or nau sena ke liye america se atyaadhunik technology kareed sakegaa
 The company making the F-16 can now make this aircraft in India as well
 lekin padhane ko mila ki yah company turki ke ankara main bhi banaati he
 It was also found that the F-16 is now outdated, so it is being removed from the US
 epa-16 banane vaali company lokaheed martin kor epa-35 bana rahi he

 Bhadrakumar has written that why Prime Minister Modi will accept F-16, if F-35 state-of-the-art fighter aircraft has come in the market
 unka yah bhi sawaal he ki kya ham america ke bharose china kii barabari kaa sapana dekh rahe hai
 This should not make Pakistan and China closer to each other
 bhadrakumar kii ashanka ko jagah isliye di kyonki aapako bataaya hi ki zyaadaatar log isaki tarif kar rahe hai
 If India and the United States are so close together, then we too will see this history today

 Bhadrakumar who is a former diplomat has raised some questions in his article
 unhone kaha he ki India has never allowed any foreign power to use its military bases
 kisi gut kaa hissaa hone se bachane ke liye or ranneetik swaittata banaae rakhi
 It will have to be seen whether India will use more American facilities or America will use Indian facilities
 simit research ke dauraan pataa chalaa ki america kaa bharat ke aasapaas ke ilaake main tamaam adde hai
 Pakistan, Afghanistan, Central Asia, Iran are everywhere
 singapore, philippinos, australia, dakshin korea or japan main bhi uske adde hai
 All the bases in the Gulf countries are built, where hundreds of its fighters, aircraft carriers, thousands of soldiers are stationed
 phir bhi use bhartiya suvidhaon ke istamaal karne kii bechaini kyon he
 Why are they historical for him? kya isliye ki bharat kareeb aayaa he yaa isliye aitihaasik he ki aas paas ab har jagah thikaana ho gaya tha magar bharat hi rah gaya tha
 It is sure that since Limoa bharat vayusena or nau sena ke liye america se atyaadhunik technology kareed sakegaa
 The company making the F-16 can now make this aircraft in India as well
 lekin padhane ko mila ki yah company turki ke ankara main bhi banaati he
 It was also found that the F-16 is now outdated, so it is being removed from the US

 There has been constant debate about Articles 370 and 35A of the Indian Constitution
 puure desh kii nigahen is maamle par he
 Union Home Minister Amit Shah had earlier said in Parliament that Article 370 in the Indian Constitution is temporary
 jammu-kashmir bharat kaa abhinn ang he or ise koi desh se alag nahin kar saktaa he
 Amit Shah received mixed response to this
 lekin sawaal ye he ki aakhir Article 370 he kya
 Learn about this article in these 10 points
 1
 Constitution experts have their own opinion about Article 370 and Article 35A of Indian Constitution
 samvidhan visheshgy subhash kashyap ne aajtak
 In a special conversation with in, said that there are no two opinions that Article 370 of the Indian Constitution is temporary
 is baat kaa zikr anuchhed main hi kiya gaya he
 2
 Article 370 ko jahaan tak hataane kaa sawaal he, to isko lekar samvidhan main do baaten kahin gai he
 The first thing is that Parliament can remove Article 370 with the consent of the Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly, while the second provision is that under Article 368 of the Constitution, Parliament can abolish it by two-thirds majority
 3
 Subhash Kashyap says that Article 368 empowers Parliament to amend or remove any article of the Constitution
 ye hi anuchhed 370 ke bare main kai gutthiyaan sulajhaata he
 4
 samvidhan visheshgy dike dube ne aajtak
 In a special conversation with in, said that Article 370 does not make special provision for the state of Jammu and Kashmir, rather it makes temporary provision for the state
 is anuchhed ko bhartiya sansad do tihaai bahumat se khatm kar sakati he
 5
 anuchhed 370 ke paksh main nahin the ambedkar: dike dube kaa kahana he ki dow bhimrao ambedkar bhartiya samvidhan main anuchhed 370 ke paksh main nahin the
 Therefore Sheikh Abdullah proposed to add this article to the Constitution and this article was added to the Constitution after a brief discussion
 6
 This article was not even seriously discussed in Parliament
 dike dube kaa kahana he ki ambedkar ne kaha tha ki vah jammu-kashmir kii policy ko lekar khush nahin he
 7
 samvidhan visheshgy dube kaa kahana he ki bhartiya samvidhan ke anuchhed 35A ko presidential order ke jariye joda gaya tha
 When this presidential order was issued, the Prime Minister was Jawaharlal Nehru and the President was Dr
 Rajendra Prasad
 kashmir jammu kashmir kii samasya kii asli jad anuchhed 35A hi he
 It can also be eliminated by the Presidential Order
 8
 Article 370 of the Indian Constitution makes a temporary provision for the state of Jammu and Kashmir
 jammu-kashmir ke liye vishesh upbandh kaa nahin, balki asthai upbandh kaa istemaal kiya gaya he
 9
 iske baad anuchhed 370 ke tahat constitution (aplicoshan tu jammu kashmir) order 1954 jari karke samvidhan main anuchhed 35A ko samvidhan main joda gaya
 10
 saal 2014 main supreme court main ek enjio ne yachika daayar kar is anuchhed ko ek bharat kii bhaavana ke khilaaf or algaavvaad ko badhaava dene vaala praavdhaan bataaya
 The legality of Article 35A and Article 370 was challenged in this petition
 is yachika main tark diya gaya ki aazaadee ke baad desh kaa samvidhan banane ke liye jo samvidhan sabha bani thi usamen jammu-kashmir ke 4 pratinidhi bhi shaamil the
 Also, the state of Jammu and Kashmir was never given special status
 ye bhi tark diya gaya ki 35-e ek asthaayee upbandh tha jise rajya main halaat ko us samay sthir karne ke liye joda gaya tha
 The framers of the Constitution did not make this article
