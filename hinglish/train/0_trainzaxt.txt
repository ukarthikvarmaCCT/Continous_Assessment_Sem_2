 There is a lot of movement these days in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
 sabase pehle varisht shahjade or purv raja shah abdulla bin abdul ajij ke bete mutaib bin abdulla ko neshnal gards ke pramukh ke pad se barkhaast kar diya gaya

 Meanwhile, such speculation is further strengthened by the deaths of two other Saudi princes Mansoor bin Mukerin and Abdul Aziz
 yahaan prince mansoor purv khufia pramukh mukarin bin abdul ajij ke bete the, jo shah salmaan ko gaddi milane se pehle janvari or april 2015 ke bich crown prince the
 All this exercise is seen as a growing force of Mohammed bin Salman

 report ke mutabik, 20 june kii raat, varisht shahjade or varisht suraksha adhikari makka sthit safa pales main mili
 He was told that King Salman wants to meet him
 aadhi raat ko mahal pahunchane par unhen bataaya gaya shah salmaan unase akele main baat karnaa chaahate hai or iske liye unhen alag kamare main le jaaya gaya
 According to the report, his mobile phone was taken in that room and he was pressurized to relinquish the throne
 shuru main unhone iskaa virodh kiya, lekin baad main raji ho gaye
 During this time, in order to take other princes into confidence, it was spread that Mohammed bin Naaf was intoxicated and did not deserve to be king
 mohammad bin salmaan hataa rahe hai raah kaa kanta!iske baad shah salmaan ne apane sabase pasandida bete mohammad ko agali pankti main laakar khadaa kar diya or unhen up pradhanmantri or rakshaamantri kaa bhi jimmaa diya gaya
 Today, Mohammed has the right to take big decisions from the policies of military, foreign, economic, social welfare
 unke paas apane desh kii teen badi senaaon kaa niyantran he or ab vah taqatvar dharmik pratishthanon ko prabhavit karne kii koshish kar rahe hai
 Meanwhile, his liberal form is also being widely publicized, including his declarations such as allowing women to drive and promoting the liberal nature of Islam in the country
 in tamaam ghatnakramon se samajha ja rahaa he ki bujurg ho chuke shah salmaan is saal ke ant kar gaddi chhod kar apane bete mohammad ko nayaa badshaah bana sakate hai
 In such a situation, this whip on the people of the royal family in the name of corruption is being seen as an attempt to hide the forces that may challenge them in the future

 unhone kaha ki iskaa matlab saaf he kapil sibbal court main babari masjid ection cameti yaa sunni vaqf board kii taraf se nahin balki congress vot board kii taraf se pesh hue the
 Sambit said that the Ram temple case that Kapil Sibal had asked to hear in the court after the 2019 elections was at the behest of Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi
 bijepi pravaktaa ne kaha kikapil sibbalko ye baat samaj main aani chahie ki court sabase upar he usko koi guide nahin kar saktaa he chaahe vah sonia gandhi ho yaa rahul gandhi
 If the court has decided that the Ram temple case will be heard everyday, then no one can challenge it
 PM modi ke bayaan par unhone kaha ki piem modi ne sahi kaha he ki wo chunaav or vot bank ko dhyaan main rakhkar faisle nahin lete hai

 unhone kaha ki rahul gandhi mandir jaae isamen kisi ko aapatti nahin he lekin wo ram mandir par bhi apana rukh saaf karen
 What Modi said on Ram temple, let me tell you that on Tuesday, the Prime Minister addressed the rally in Dhandhuka
 yahaan unhone ram mandir ke mudde par kaha ki chunaav ke bich ab congress bhi khud ko ram mandir se jod rahi he, lekin unhen raashtra kii chintaa nahin he
 On hearing the temple issue in the Supreme Court, PM Modi said that yesterday Kapil Sibal was speaking on behalf of the parties of Babri Masjid, it is his business, not a complaint
 lekin kya unhen 2019 tak sunwaayee taalane kii maang kerani chahie, kya congress kii ore se ram mandir mudde ko chunaav tak taalane kii koshish kii ja rahi he

 haryana ke purv mukhyamantri bhupendra singh hooda ne 18 agast ko rohtak main raily kar apni hi party congress ko ankhen dikhaai thim
 Hooda lashed out at the Congress high command and even said that the party has lost its way
 hooda ne jab mahaparivartan raily kii ghoshnaa kii thi, tab siyaasi halkon main yah charchaa joro par thi ki vah haath kaa saath chhodkar nai party banane kaa elaan kar denge
 The way the preparations were made for the rally, it seemed the same, but when the rally was over, all the speculations were proved wrong
 hooda ne na to nai party ke gathan kaa elaan kiya or na hi congress chodi
 Hooda declared himself the chief ministerial candidate at the rally and criticized the high command for opposing the Centre's decision to remove Article 370 from Jammu and Kashmir
 raajnneeti ke kuch jaankaar ise congress ke pradesh adhyaksh ashok tanvar ke khilaaf hooda kaa hallaa bol bataa rahe hai, to vahiin kuch ise apane khilaaf chal rahe maamalon main raahat paane ke uddeshy se modi sarkaar ko apane soft ravaiye kaa sandesh bataa rahe hai
 Somewhere this has not changed as Hooda's Surbhupinder Singh Hooda is facing a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) inquiry into the re-allocation of the Associate Journal Limited (AJL) plot
 hooda ke mukhyamantri rahete ageel ko 3360 varg meter kaa plot niyamon kii andekhi kar dobaaraa aavantit kar die jane kaa aarope he
 In 1982, when Bhajanlal was the Chief Minister of Sector 6, Panchkula, the allotted plot was withdrawn by the government after 10 years
 sibiai is maamle kii jaanch kar rahi he or hooda kii bhoomika bhi jaanch ke daayre main he
 On August 22, Hooda filed a petition in the special CBI court seeking discharge
 isse bhi hooda kii raily ke alag nihitarth talashne ke aadhaar ko bal mila he
 However, despite p Chidambaram's soft approach towards the government, the hope of relief in the political corridors, citing exception to the JD in action, is seen as a reason for Hooda's scorn towards Congress
 plot aavanton se jude cese se nijaat chaahate hai hoodahooda kii yachika par 18 sitambar ko sunwaayee hogi, lekin sawaal yah uth rahaa he ki aakhir kya vajah he ki jab pradesh ke chunaav main mahaj chand maah shesh hai, vah plot aavanton se jude cese se nijaat chaahate hai
 The reason behind this is that he wants to see the attitude of CBI
 hooda ne bhale hi aage kii ranneeti tay karne ke liye purv mantriyon or vidhayakon kii cameti banane kaa elaan kiya ho, lekin jaankaar ise sibiai ke rukh par nirbhar bataa rahe hai
 Hooda's next move, dependent on the cbi's stance, has also led to several cases when leaders have been relieved in the CBI investigation by joining or supporting the ruling party
 aise main hooda kaa aglaa kadam kaaphi had tak 18 sitambar ko hone vaali sunwaayee par nirbhar mana ja rahaa he
 Some Congress leaders are saying the same thing
 haryana or raajnneeti kaa paryaay rahe bhupendra singh hooda kii ginati vaise bhi siyaasi daanv-pench main maahir netaaon main hoti he
 Know what is in the mind of Hooda, a veteran of Haryanvi politics, who was the Chief Minister of Haryana from 2005 to 2014, but everyone's eyes are on his next step

 Security has been beefed up for Chief Minister Mayawati's visit to Delhi and various districts of the state
 aatankwaadiyon, maovadiyon or anya aparaadhiyon kii ore se khatre ko dekhte hue unki suraksha badhaai gai he
 In a letter sent to the police chiefs of Ghaziabad, Gautam Budh Nagar, Bulandshahr, Meerut and Baghpat, IGP (meerut) Chander Prakash directed that special security arrangements be made in their districts during the chief minister's visit
 gajiabad or gautamabuddha nagar kii police dilli ke daure ke samay unako suraksha muhaiyaa karaayegi

 bharat ne kaha- apni raajnneeti ke liye jhooth bol rahe imranpakistan beete 72 saal se lagaataar sabhi alpsankhyakon kaa utpeedan kar rahapakistan ke pradhanmantri imran khan dwaara geneva main bharat ko lekar die gaye bayaan kii bharat ne mangalvaar ko ninda kii
 Imran Khan while addressing the Global Forum on Refugees in Geneva said that due to curfew in Kashmir and the new citizenship law of India, millions of Muslims can flee India
 jisase duniya main sharnaarthi kaa sankat badhegaa jiske aage anya sankat kam pad jaaenge
 Responding to Imran Khan's statement, Foreign Ministry spokesman Ravish Kumar said, "pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan has once again made a baseless and baseless statement on India's purely internal matter to increase its narrow political agenda
 Lied on stage
 puri duniya ko spasht kiya jaataa he ki yah unki aadat he or vaishvik manchon kaa durupyog he
 Ravish Kumar said that the Islamic Republic of Pakistan has been persecuting all minorities continuously for the last 72 years and most of them have been forced to flee to India
 unhone kaha ki imran khan duniya ko yah bataanaa bhul jate hai ki 1971 main unki sena ne purvi pakistan (ab bangladesh) ke logon ke saath kya kiya

 karnataka vidhansabha chunaav kii matganana ke shuruaati rujhaanon main bijepi kii jeet tay maani ja rahi he
 The Congress is moving ahead towards a drastic defeat
 aise main visheshgyon kii raay main congress or rahul gandhi kaa karnataka ke siem siddharmaiya par aankh band kar bharosa karnaa mahangaa padaa
 In the trends, Siddaramaiah is seen struggling on both seats Badami and Chamundeshwari
 badami main siem ko bijepi ke adivasee netaa shriramulu se unhen kadi takkar mil rahi he
 Siddaramaiah is pitted against GT Deve Gowda of JDS and SR Gopal Rao of BJP on Chamundeshwari seat
 chamundeshwari seat par siddharmaiya ek badi haar kii ore bad rahe hai
 Let us tell you that the Congress has failed to save power in Karnataka, one reason behind this is to give open exemption to Siddaramaiah in making electoral strategy
 siddharmaiya ke in faislon par diya saathsatta main dobaaraa lautne ke liye siddharmaiya ne kai vivaadit faisle kiye
 The Congress party supported Siddaramaiah on all these decisions
 lingayat ko alag dharm kaa darja dene kaa mudda ho yaa kannada asmita kii raajnneeti, siddharmaiya ne har daanv apni ranneeti ke tahat chalaa
 He also left no stone unturned in making this election local versus external and he continued to attack PM Modi and BJP President Amit Shah instead of getting entangled with bjp's CM candidate Yeddyurappa
 vipaksh se mukaable ke liye bhi siddharmaiya akele maidan main date rahe
 In every election, Siddaramaiah was targeted by bjp's CM candidates BS Yeddyurappa and PM Modi
 siddharmaiya akele donon se chunavi reliyon ke saath-saath soshal media main jang ladate dikhe
 bjp's strategy worked in the election
 bijepi yediurppa ko jarur siem pad kaa cheharaa banaaya tha, lekin usne piem modi kii lokapriyata ko khub bhunaaya
 At the same time, the Congress's stakes in giving Siddaramaiah an open exemption were not successful
 ekmaatr chehrekarnataka main bhale hi sonia gandhi, congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi or mallikarjun khadge ne tamaam reliyaan kin
 But only Siddaramaiah had a face before the people of Karnataka
 yahi nahin, un muddon par chunaav ladaa gaya jo pichley 5 saalon main siddharmaiya ne karnataka ke liye kiya
 If the Congress strategy is seen in the elections, it gave Siddaramaiah a free hand to a large extent
 bhrashtachar ke aropchunaav main bijepi ne bhrashtachar ke mudde par siemsiddharmayaper sidhaa hamalaa bolaa tha
 During the election campaign, PM Modi repeatedly said that the countdown of Congress in Karnataka has started
 unhone kaha tha ki congress sarkaar bhrashtachar ke nae kirtiman sthapit kar rahi he
 Now the time has come for his departure from here
 vah satta se baahar hone ke muhane par khadi he
 At the same time, BJP and Modi also attacked CM Siddaramaiah's government with the word 'sidhi Rupaiya'
 agra ke ukhrra aria main buudhvaar ko matam pasra rahaa
 The body of Aman Shashi Anand (24), who was killed in a Macau accident in China, arrived at his house 16 days later

 bharat or srilanka ke bich gaale main khele ja rahe pehle test match ke pehle din srilanka ko bada jhatka laga he
 Actually, this blow is not given by anyone else but Shikhar Dhawan to Sri Lanka
 match ke pehle hi din dhawan ne aisa shot lagaaya ki virdohi khilaadi kaa angootha tut gaya
 Sri Lankan batsman Asela Gunaratne is injured due to Dhawan's shot and is also out of the match
 asela kii chot itani ghaatak thi ki unhen colombo ke aspataal le jaaya gaya
 According to media reports, Asela will have a thumb operation
 aapako bataa den ki asela maujuuda match se to baahar ho hi gaye hai saath hi puri test siries ke alaava 5 maichon kii vanade siries se bhi baahar ho gaye hai
 Actually, Sri Lanka's fast bowler Kumara was throwing the 14th over during India's innings
 is over kii aakhri gend par shikhar dhawan ne ek tej-tarraar shot lagaaya, lekin gend balle kaa kinaaraa lete hue sidhe slip par khadey asela gunaratna kii taraf gai or unhone is gend ko kaich lene ke liye dive lagaai lekin gend unke anguuthe par ja lagi or wo maidan par hi dard se let gaye

 Just like it is seen in many cities of China in winter
 ab logon ke gharon main kaid hone ke din aa gaye hai
 Poison will dissolve in the air of delhi-ncr so that it will become difficult for you to breathe
 badalati sthitiyon ko dekhakar rajdhani ke logon ko salaah di gai he ki pradooshit hawa se dur rahe

 According to SAFAR (system of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research), 14 October 2019 i
e
 PM2 in delhi-ncr today
 5 kaa str 121 hai
 Which falls in the very poor category
 yah kal yani 15 oktober ko 129 ho saktaa he
 This means that the condition may worsen
 jabaki, 3 din baad yah 136 ke ank par chali jaaegi
 At the same time, the level of PM10 today is 258 in delhi-ncr on 14 October 2019
 kal yani 15 oktober ko yah 234 or teen din baad 277 ank ho jayega
 That is, the amount of poison in the air will increase
 aakhir aisa ho kyon rahaa he?teji se jahrili ho rahi he dilli kii hawa, haryana main jamkar jal rahi paralidilli main pradooshan kaa abhi sabase bada kaaran he paraali kaa jalaana
 
 
 This year, the monsoon rains have been around 10 per cent above normal across the country
 dilli ke aasapaas ke rajyon main bhi barish kii maatra thik rahi he
 This time the monsoon was late but stayed for a long time
 isliye chaaval kii kheti ke liye dilli ke padosi rajyon ke bharpoor maatra main pani mila
 This has led to bumpy yields of rice and other crops
 ab in fasalon kii paraali ko jalaayaa ja rahaa he
 Due to which the air of Delhi and the breath of people are in trouble
 SAFAR ke is graphics main saaf dikh rahaa he ki pakistan, punjab or haryana main paraali kahaan-kahaan jalaai ja rahi he
 Straw is being burnt in Punjab, Haryana and Pakistan
 america antariksh agency NASA ne 1 oktober se 14 oktober tak 1645 jagahon par paraali jalaane kii ghatana dikhi he
 SAFAR has also confirmed that stubble is being burnt in Punjab, Haryana and Pakistan
 or hawa kii disha dilli kii taraf he, isliye paraali kaa dhuaan dilli kii hawaaon main mil rahaa he
 Why the 'digital Army' of the Central Pollution Control Board is ready to fight the bad wind, the rain is becoming the reason for the pollution of Delhi, according to the Indian Meteorological Department, monsoon rains started around June 5 this year
 ab tak yani 14 oktober 2019 tak yah saamaanya se kareeb 10 fisadi zyada he
 In Punjab and Haryana also, the rainfall has been more than normal
 NASA kii maane to is baar punjab or haryana main chaaval kii paidaavaar badhegi
 NASA has hoped that this time 200 metric tons of starch will be released
 ise jalaane se zyada pradooshan hoga
 The amount of air pollution is seen more in October this year as compared to last year
 1 ton paraali jalaane se aakhir kitna pradooshan hota he?nasa ke mutabik 1 ton parani jalaane se 2 kilogram sulfur dioxide (SO2), 3 kilogram particulet matter (PM), 60 kilogram carbon monooxide (CO), 1,460 kilogram carbon monooxide (CO2) or 199 kilogram raakh paidaa hoti he
 Now think about how much pollution will be caused if 200 metric tons of straw is burnt
 teen maheene baad phir ghutane laga dilli kaa dam, agle do dinon tak raahat nahinis saal or bad saktaa he dilli-ncr main vaayu pradooshaninasha ke normelised diference vegetesan index (NDVI) duniyabar main fasalon kii paidaavaar kaa aankada jutata he
 According to NASA, the incidence of stubble burning is increasing every year from 2002 to 2018
 sabase zyada paraali jalaane kii ghatana 2016 main darj hui thi
 In 2016, there were 18 thousand incidents of stubble burning
 NASA ko ashanka he ki is saal 16 hajaar ke aasapaas ye aankada pahonchega

 Pujara faced 87 balls on the pitch of Indian batsmen on the pitch of the heavylords which was run out
 haalanki is dauraan unhone 17 ran hi banaae, lekin us samay ran banane se zyada jaruri wicket par tikna tha
 Talking about Pujara, due to the wrong call of captain Virat Kohli in the first innings, he had to run out and lose his wicket, otherwise the picture of India's first innings would have been different

 After the poor performance of the Trinamool Congress in the Lok Sabha elections, Bengal Chief Minister and Trinamool Congress leader Mamata Banerjee met Election Strategist Prashant Kishore on Thursday in Kolkata
 mamata banerjee se mulaakaat karne ke liye kishor party ke saansad abhishek banerjee ke saath rajya sachivalay gaye
 His meeting with the Chief Minister lasted for about 90 minutes
 42 loksabhaa siton main se, trinmul congress ne 22 or bijepi ne 18 siten jiti hai
 While the Trinamool got 12 seats less than in 2014, the BJP gained 16 seats
 atakalein lagaai ja rahi hai ki 2021 main bengal vidhansabha chunaav ke liye prashanth kishor or mamata kii party tiemasi ke bich sahmati bani he
 Sources are also quoting that Prashant Kishore will formulate a strategy for TMC
 haalanki prashanth kishor kii party jediu ke pravaktaa ne is bare main khaas jaankaree dene se manaa kar diya, lekin itnaa jarur kaha ki kishor nijee str par kya karte hai, isse party kaa koi lenaa dena nahin he
 If Prashant Kishore really works for Mamta Banerjee, it will be shocking news as he is the national vice president of JDU and only Chief Minister Nitish Kumar is above him
 jediu chunki bihar or centre main bijepi kii sahyogi party he, isliye is par tajjub hona swaabhaavik he ki prashanth kishor waisi kisi party se haath kaise mila sakate hai jo bijepi kii dhur virdohi ho
 Also read: After Jagan Mohan Reddy, Prashant Kishor will now work for Mamta Banerjee! BJP in Bengal is preparing for the 2021 assembly elections well in advance
 is baar loksabhaa chunaav main 18 siten milane ke baad uski ummiden or paravaan chadhi hai
 Meanwhile, Prashant Kishore working for TMC could be costly for BJP as Prashant Kishore has a good track record in strategy making
 centre kii pehali modi sarkaar ko prachand str par jeet dilaane main prashanth kishor kii ahm bhoomika rahi
 At that time, Kishore was the real BJP strategist
 prashanth kishor ne online se lekar ofline str tak par prachaar kii tagdi or prabhavi muhim chalaai jiskaa asar bijepi ko chapparfaad vot milane ke rup main dekha gaya
 Conquered Jaganmohan: Recently, Andhra Pradesh elections were held along with the Lok Sabha elections
 in donon chunaavon main jaganmohan reddy kii party wiesar congress ne chandrababu naidu kii party tidipi kaa supada saaf kar diya
 Jagan Mohan held the post of Chief Minister after the bitter defeat of TDP
 jagan mohan ke prachaar kaa abhiyaan or party kii ranneeti prashanth kishor ne hi banaai thi
 The YSR Congress had installed countdown clocks in all the constituencies, which gave a boost to its campaign
 digital ulti ginati karne vaali ghadiyon kaa vichaar or naaraa indian political ection cameti (ipiesi) kii ore se diya gaya
 The IPAC was formed by Prashant Kishore, an election strategist
 isse pehle ipiesi ne prachaar naaraa 'rawali jagan, kawali jagan (ham jagan ko chaahate hai, jagan aana chahie)' diya tha
 Elections were held on April 11 for the 175-member assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the state, with the YSR Congress registering a landslide victory
 prashanth kishor ne jagan reddy ke liye dedh saal pehle kaam karnaa shuru kar diya tha
 For this, he had added 20 thousand youths to YSR Congress
 kishor ne 175 vidhansabha kshetron main khud party ke prachaar kaa 70 fisadi kaam sambhala tha
 46 thousand booths and 11-11 member booth committees were built in the state
 unke nirdesh par hi party ke liye 5 lakh booth kaaryakartaaon ne kaam kiya
 Prashant Kishore's strategy was that Jagan Reddy embarked on a padyatra which benefited him immensely
 2014 main bijepi kii banaai ranneetiprashanth kishor ne iske pehle 2014 main bijepi ke liye ranneeti banaai thi
 He took charge of campaigning for BJP and Narendra Modi himself and implemented it when, where and how to campaign
 prashanth kishor kii ranneeti kaa nateeja rahaa ki 2014 main bijepi prachand vot paakar centre sarkaar main pahunchi or narendra modi bijepi ke itihaas main pehali baar bahumat vaale pradhanmantri bane
 Conquered Nitish Kumar: Kishor worked for Nitish Kumar and his party JDU in the 2015 Bihar assembly elections
 us chunaav main bijepi kaa jediu ke saath gathbandhan nahin tha
 In this election, JDU got 71 seats and RJD got 80 seats while BJP got 53 seats
 baad main argedy or jediu ne milakar sarkaar banaaya
 However, the government did not last long
 baad main jediu ne argedy se naata todakar bijepi ke saath sarkaar banaai
 Failure in UP, Prashant Kishore worked for Congress in the 2017 assembly elections in PKUP, which passed in Punjab
 aisa kaha jaataa he ki priyanka gandhi ke kehane par prashanth kishor punjab gaye or captain amarinder singh ke liye kaam kiya
 It was a coincidence that the Congress formed a government in Punjab while the Congress was marginalized in UP
 in donon pradeshon main prashanth kishor kii acchhee bhoomika rahi
 Lack of resources can no longer be an obstacle for rural students who aspire to serve the country by becoming IAS and IPS as they can now sit in remote countryside and prepare for UPSC exams with ease

 " (input-ins) reliance jeeyo infocom (jio) ne microsoft ke saath 10 saal kaa jo qaraar kiya he usase bharat ke digital-iti jagat main bada badlaav hone ke asaar hai
 This will reduce the cost of information technology (IT), but it can also prove to be a major challenge for the businesses of American companies like Amazon and Google
 aisa mana ja rahaa he ki telecom sector jaisaa price war ab cloud computing main shuru ho saktaa he
 According to this agreement, Jio will build data centers across India and will support Microsoft's cloud computing platform Agure in Data Center
 in donon ke sanyog se jeeyo ke tamaam ofer ko or behatar bhi banaaya ja sakegaa
 According to a report by the news agency Reuters, this could prove to be a big challenge for companies already offering cloud services like amazon-google
 cloud sarvice ke tahat tamaam computer aadhaarit sevaayen jaise web hosting or data storage aadi muhaiyaa kiye jate hai
 Reliance's entry into this field will compete fiercely in the Indian market
 abhi tak is bazaar par amejon web services (AWS) kaa dabadabaa he
 According to the Times of India, Jio is currently building two data centers in Gujarat and Maharashtra which will start functioning from next year
 reliance industries (RIL) ke chairman mukesh ambani ne is qaraar kii ghoshnaa karte hue somvaar ko kaha tha, 'is gathjod se hamaare paas bharat kendrit samaadhaan viksit karne kii kshamta hasil ho jaaegi, jaise sabhi badi bhashaaon or boliyon ke liye spich rikgnishan or natural language kii samaj
 'with this, all the small and medium businesses of the country will be able to take advantage of many cloud products and business applications like Office 365
 is avasar par video conferencing ke maadhmay se microsoft ke siio satya nadela ne kaha, 'ham milakar ek vyapak technology samaadhaan pesh kar sakate hai
 'world class data centers will be set up across the country through the jio-microsoft alliance
 mukesh ambani ne kaha ki isse zyada se zyada sanghathanon ko apni digital kshamta ke liye jaruri tul or plateform hasil ho sakegaa
 It is worth noting that when Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries (RIL) entered the telecom business in 2016, the entire game was lost to the old players
 jeeyo ne tarriff war shuru kar is bazaar kaa bada hissaa hasil kar liya
 Similarly, it is now believed that cloud computing will also start price wise
 jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki ab AWS or google jaise puraane khilaadi bhi sasti keemton vaale model pesh karne par majaboor ho sakate hai
 This market is growing at a rate of 23 per cent annually and its size 5 in the next five years
 6 arab dollar tak pahunch saktaa he
 Significantly, the 42nd Annual General Meeting was organized by Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) on Monday
 chunaav ke elaan ke saath hi congress party or khud rahul gandhi kii taraf se yah saaf kar diya gaya tha ki priyanka gandhi na to chunaav ladane ja rahi hai or na hi deshbhar main ghumkar prachaar karne
 Priyanka's role in the election was decided that she would campaign only in Amethi and Rae Bareli
 amethi se bhai rahul gandhi or raibareli se maa sonia gandhi maidan main hai
 In such a situation, Priyanka Gandhi took this task as a family responsibility
 rahul or sonia ke desh bhar main hone vaale daure ke ko-ardination kaa zimmaa bhi priyanka ko diya gaya
 Altogether 10 Janpath and the Congress party gave a message to keep Priyanka's political activism linked to familyhood
 jaise-jaise amethi or raibareli main chunaav kii taarikh najadik ai priyanka kii sakriyata vahaan badi
 a program to reconcile the people there with the party workers started
 isi ke saath priyanka kii taraf se bayanon kaa silsilaa bhi shuru hua
 The media began to give prominence to every activity and statements of Priyanka
 ye isliye bhi kyonki priyanka amethi raibareli main nahin hotin he to media se puri tarah se dur rahati hai
 Priyanka's husband Robert Vadra has long been a target of the BJP and the Aam Aadmi Party
 uma bharti to yahaan tak bayaan de chuki ki agar bijepi kii sarkaar ai to damaad ji jail main honge
 Facing such an attack, Priyanka made an emotional statement during the election campaign, saving her husband Vadra
 kaha ki parivaar ko jitna nishaanaa banaaya jayega vah utana majboot hokar ubharegi
 Priyanka did not stop here
 unhone smriti irani par hamalaa bolkar ek tarah se team modi ko lalakaara
 In retaliation, Irani repeatedly addressed Priyanka by her husband's surname Vadra Vadra
 kul milakar priyanka ne amethi-raibareli se hi aise sandesh dene shuru kiye jise deshbhar main suna jane laga
 As the case of rahul-sonia vs Modi was going on, in such a situation Priyanka's involvement as a third character began to seem overwhelming to the BJP
 khaastaur par tab jab priyanka ne sidhe modi par hamalaa bolaa ki mahila suraksha kii baat karte ho or band kamare main hamaare phone sunate ho
 There have been attacks on Modi before on Snoopgate, but the word that came out of Priyanka's mouth pierced the BJP like an arrow
 desh chalaane ke liye 56 inch kaa seenaa nahin, balki dariyaadilii chahie- priyanka ke ye bayaan party ko andar tak chubho gaya
 Actually, when a man talks about the width of his chest, he is looking at it with his effort
 aise main koi mahila usase jodakar koi baat kahe to use apane purusharth par sawaal lagata he
 The attack is further exacerbated when the 'vikas Purush' of the BJP is targeted on whom the party has united to come to power
 priyanka ko gherne kaa modi or bijepi ke paas ek hi rasta nazar aata he
 That is to spark a controversy related to her husband Robert Vadra
 bijepi ne vahi kiya
 By releasing a booklet and film titled 'son-in-law', BJP has attacked Priyanka the most befuddling on its behalf
 isamen wadra ke haryana or rajasthan main zamin kii dling par tamaam sawaal uthaae gaye hai
 The timing of this booklet and the film may be acceptable to the BJP politically, but the biggest question was raised on behalf of the Aam Aadmi Party
 sanjay singh ne bayaan jari kar kaha ki bijepi nakalati bachche kii tarah vyavhaar kar rahi he
 She is repeating the same allegations against Vadra, which the Aam Aadmi Party has been raising for a long time
 bijepi ke ‘khulaase’ ko khaarij karte hue priyanka ne baukhalaaye chuuhe kii tarah bhaagane vaala bayaan dekar bijepi kii khij ko or badhaane kaa hi kaam kiya he
 Priyanka is believed to be the trump card of the Congress, which will be played in future politics
 amethi-raibareli ke apane limited role main bhi priyanka bijepi ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar narendra modi ko jis tarah se gherne kaa kaam kiya he uskaa faaydaa beshak congress ko in chunaavon main us tarah se na ho jaisaa ki priyanka ke chunaav se bahut pehle hi sakriy ho jane main hota
 But Modi and BJP are trying to get the challenge dusted before it escalates
 raajnneeti main yah koi nai baat nahin he
 Overall, the war between Priyanka and modi-bjp is expected to be intense and bitter
 bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah ne somvaar ko kaha ki centre main narendra modi ke aane ke baad se keemten kam hui he or yah rujhaan chaalu maheene main bhi jari rahegaa
 Addressing an election meeting in Lonavala, he said, "since Modi became Prime Minister, prices of petrol and diesel as well as essential commodities have come down and this trend of reduction in prices will continue in October
 ' Shah emphasized on the inter-state relations between the center and the state to ensure proper development of the state and requested people to vote for the BJP for the October 15 assembly elections in Maharashtra
 shah ne kaha, 'maharashtra main ek sarkaar honi chahie jo ki vikaas kii raah par rajya ko aage le jane ke liye centre main narendra modi ke saath kandhaa se kandhaa milakar kaam kare
 ' bhaajapa adhyaksh ne purv congress-rakanpa gathbandhan par bhi nishaanaa saadhaa
 The indigenous Indians are particularly enthusiastic about the match
 ummid he ki muqabla jabardast rahegaa

 Amitabh Bachchan appeared for the first time in the movie with Aamir Khan

 During her hobby of collecting coins, the eye fell on the weighing weights

 Pradeep Sethi has been collecting weights of different princely states for the last several years and through them are exploring all the untouched aspects that can give a new perspective to the history of India
 unke paas edi, sanwat, fasali or hijri san ke bhi baat hai

 sethi bataate hai ki riyasatkaal main baat sirf saamaan taulne kaa jariya bhar nahin the balki angreji hukumat main riyasaton ke liye raajnneetik maksadon kaa sandesh dene kaa aujaar bhi the
 In 1902, when the British took away the right to issue coins from the princely states, many princely states expressed their displeasure through bets, considering it a deep injury to their identity
 baat of bhopals sahit apane kai shodhon main dow
 Sethi tells many stories, opening the layers of history
 bhopal riyasat ke baaton se judaa aisa hi ek dilachasp kissa he bhopal kii sultan jahaan begum kaa, jinhone riyasat kii bagdor sanbhaalane ke salbhar ke bheetar 31,000 se zyada aadesh nikaale the
 In 1905, during the accession of Prince of Wales George V, he was awarded the rank of Knight Grade Commander in Delhi
 us samay sanchaar ke saadhan nahin the or na hi sikke dhaalane kaa adhikaar tha, so is khabar ko janata tak pahunchane ke liye begum ne hind riyasat nite grad commander likhaa baat nikaala
 In 1925-26, Begum also brought out a weight in English to influence the British
 isi tarah indore ke maharaja tukojirao ke duusare bete shivajirao ne baaton ke jariye angrejon se apni naaraazgi jataai thi
 At that time there was a big business and market of opium in Indore, on which the British did not tax for many months
 is kar chori se naaraaz maharaja ne siyaganj main nai samanaantar mandi shuru kar or apni bhashaa main baat nikaal kar apana virodh jataayaa tha
 Similarly, when the Prince of Wales came to Gwalior in 1905– 1906, Madhavrao Scindia, the great Maharaja of the princely state of Gwalior, had drawn a weight from him as a symbol of his intimate relations
 datia state ke ek baat par vir dalp sharandah yani ham vir sharan dene vaale hai darj he
 History tells that Datia Maharaj gained heroic momentum by giving shelter to three women

 Sethi has also written a book titled Study in Holkar State in 1976, co-authored by Richard Holkar and Shashikant Bhatt
 ve bataate hai ki har riyasat kaa baat kaa maapdand alag hota tha
 Somewhere the weights were of clay, some stones were of gold, silver or bronze
 ve bataate hai ki vaise baat do tarah kaa hota he-kaccha or pakkaa baat
 The raw weight is considered to be half the recorded weight
 yah poochne par ki sabase halkaa baat koun-sa he? ve kehete hai ki manu smriti main likhaa he ki dhoop kii kiran main dikhaai dene vaala dhul kaa kan sabase halkaa vajan he

 To say that mining has been banned in most of the area here for 10 years, yet the manner in which the plea to stop mining in the Supreme Court intermittently shows that illegal mining never stops
 udhar haryana main manohar laal khatter ke netritv vaali bijepi sarkaar pahaado ko barabaad karne main ek kadam aage bad gai he
 On April 13, the Haryana forest secretary overturned his March 12 order under which most of the land in the Aravalli mountain range was officially covered under the definition of 'forest land'

 Regarding the Alwar district of the state, the forest department report said that 2,612 hectares of forest land in Bhiwadi, Tapukra, Tijara and Kishangarhbas areas have been completely eradicated

 On this matter, the CBI said that only after the framing of the charges, the evidence can be heard thoroughly and not at this time

 input-ians bharat ke yuva branded kapadon ke diwane hai
 They spend between Rs 2,500 and Rs 5,000 on expensive brand clothes every month
 yah baat ravivaar ko jari hue ek surveykshan main saamne ai
 The survey, conducted by 'associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India' (assocham), concluded by talking to 2,000 youth aged 13-21 in 10 cities across the country
 asocham ke mahasachiv dies ravat ne kaha, "fishan ke prati jaagruk kishoravay ladke or ladkiyaan apni chhavi ko lekar kaaphi chintit ho gaye hai or ise pehle se kahin adhik gambhirtha se le rahe hai
 "35 per cent of the youth surveyed admitted that they spend an average of Rs 5,000 a month on branded apparel
 kareeb 40 fisadi pratibhaagiyon ne bataaya ki ve maheene main 4,000 rupee branded kapadon par kharch karte hai
 Around 400 respondents said that they spend 3,500 to 4,000 rupees a month on branded clothes
 baaki ne kaha ki ve in kapadon par 2,500 rupee tak kharch karte hai
 Rawat continued, "today's youth want to present themselves differently from others and spend a large part of their allowance on clothes
 " adhyayan main paaya gaya ki yuvaaon ko sportwear main 'nike' brands sabase adhik pasand he
 'adidas' comes second in their choice, while some youngsters also like Reebok, Puma, Woodland and Phila brand clothes
 anaupchaarik paridhaanon (cajual viyar) main levis sabase zyada pasand kiya jane vaala brands he
 Jeans of Lee, Wrangler, Flying Machine, Pep Jeans London, Diesel, Spiker, k-lounges and Numero Uno are then preferred
 jabase maine lokapal andolan ko cover kiya or aaj jab main ab tak ke sabase romaanchak dilli chunaav main aam aadmi party ko cover kar rahaa hum
 The first thing i notice here is that this movement or this party is not threatened by any other enemy because it does not let anyone get a chance and does its own harm
 guuruuvaar ko subah se news channel par aam aadmi party ke sansthaapak sadsy shanti bhushan ne aam aadmi party par arvind kejariwal par apni raay media main dekar party kii shanti bhang kar di
 The nomination phase ended in Delhi on Wednesday itself
 ummid thi ki guuruuvaar se prachaar main teji dikhegi lekin hua wo jo sochaa na tha
 According to Shanti Bhushan, Arvind Kejriwal has failed and he should step down from the post of convenor
 shanti bhushan kaa yahaan tak kahana he ki kejariwal ne swaraj ke siddhant ko tyaag diya he or wo sunate to sabaki he, lekin bahumat kii raay par nahin chalate balki apni baat sab par thopate hai
 Shanti Bhushan is upset with the party's ticket distribution
 unka kahana he ki party main apane kaaryakartaaon or eemaandaar kii bajaay jitau ummidavaar ko tikat dene par tavajjo di ja rahi he
 Arvind Kejriwal says that everyone in the party has the right to speak and as far as the ticket is concerned, the candidates who were not clear in the investigation of internal Lokpal, have also cut their tickets
 virdohi koi aarope lagaae to samaj main aata he, lekin jab koi apana or wo bhi shanti bhushan ke kad vaala, to na to baat samaj aati he or na hi party samajha paati he
 But, i am throwing light on a bigger question than this and that this is not the first time that the party is harming its own
 party ko sabase zyaada nuksaan us istife ne pahunchaaya jo 49 din sarkaar chalaakar diya gaya or jisaki vajah se loksabhaa chunaav main party ne niraashajanak pradarshan kiya
 Kejriwal and his party are still explaining the same reason to the people
 party ko nuksaan pahunchaaya uske apane vidhayak vinod kumaar binni ne jo baagi ho gaye
 Whatever the reason, the party could not succeed in handling the matter and the party's reputation was damaged
 janvari 2014 main party ne sarkaar main rahete hue jis tarah se do din dilli ke rail bhawan par dharna kiya, usase bhi party ko nuksaan hua
 In June 2014, the exchange of letters between party leaders Yogendra Yadav and Manish Sisodia went public with the two accusing each other
 usase party ko nuksaan hua
 This party is still new, so the opponents do not have much to say against it, but when there are such sentences in the party, why should the opponents also be tense? Yes, it can be said that the party is new, learning and when you make a new attempt in democracy, it is natural to have it all
 lekin, phir bhi baat to yahi he ki in maamalon kii vajah se hi kisi bahari ne party ko nuksaan pahunchaaya yadi iske alaava koi maamla mili jisamen apano se pehle baazi virdohi maar le gaye hon to mujhe zarur bataanaa

 vishwa bharti ke ek skool main 11 saal kii bacchee ko geela bistar chatkar saaf karne kii sajaa ko swami agnivesh jaij tehra rahe hai
 This statement of Agnivesh, who once worked for bonded laborers, is more shocking
 agnivesh kaa kahana he ki is maamle ko bahut tool nahin dena chahie
 He argues that if this girl is punished for licking a wet bed, then it is not a big deal, because in Ayurveda urination is tried like a cure
 agnivesh kaa kahana he ki warden ne bacchee ko haath−paanv baandhakar is kaam ke liye majaboor nahin kiya

 However, he was later released on bail

 Agnivesh says that this matter should not be overstated
 unki daleel he ki is bacchee ko agar geela bistar chaatane kii sajaa di gai, to yah koi badi baat nahin, kyonki ayurveda main mutrpan baqayada ilaaj kii tarah aajamaaya jaataa he
 Agnivesh says that the warden did not force the girl to do this by tying her arms and legs
 tippaniyan On the other hand, in the case of the incident of allegedly forcing the fifth grade student to drink her own urine, the Ministry of Human Resource Development has submitted a report to the Prime Minister's Office, in which factual details of the incident have been given
 is ghatana ke saamne aane ke baad se logon main naaraazgi dekhne ko mili
 The hostel warden accused of allegedly giving such inhuman punishment to the girl for wetting the bed was arrested and suspended
 haalanki baad main use jamaanat par reeha kar diya gaya
 Significantly, Vishwa Bharati University has the status of a Central University and its Chancellor is the Prime Minister

 Gavaskar told NDTV, he (dhoni) stepped forward and led
 usne mushkil paristhiti main ballebaaji kii
 He set the example
 agar uske udhaaharan se puri team ne sikh nahin lee, to mujhe nahin lagata ki aap captain ko doshi tehra sakate hai
 i do not think there is any option other than Mahendra Singh Dhoni in the near future and i will support him to retain the captaincy
 bisisiai ne mangalvaar ko purv bhartiya ol rounder sanjay bangad or purv bhartiya tej gendbaaj bharat arun ko shastri ke antargat sahaayak coach banaaya he
 Gavaskar said, i think the BCCI has appointed coaches, assistant coaches who are really interested in Indian cricket, they are not interested in any commercial interest
 unka asar padegaa, lekin dhyaan rahe ki yah turant nahin hoga, isliye aapako thodaa or dhairya baratna hoga
