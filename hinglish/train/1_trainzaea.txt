 ' India almost won the match against Bangladesh during the World T20, winning the last three balls by dismissing three opposition players by just one run, and after that all Hindustan cricket fans started celebrating almost out of control
 
 
 hamen to lagata he, itnaa joardaar jashn to world cap jeetne par bhi shaayad hi kabhi manaa hoga
 
 
 By the way, such a celebration is not surprising, because the match was the one that forced the fans to gnaw at the nail
 
 
 tippaniyan But the most interesting fact is that after the match, as usual, Team India got a wave of congratulatory messages, as well as Twitterati for the Indian team captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni (a term used for those active on Twitter)
 Looked crazy, and nothing was visible to Dhoni except in every other tweet
 
 
 or sirf micro-bloging site twitor nahin, fasebuk par bhi dhoni ke liye divaanaapan kam nazar nahin aayaa
 
 
 Well, it had to happen, because what Mahendra Singh Dhoni did was really incredible
 
 
 itane jabardast tanaav ke bich dimag ko shant rakhana, aakhri over ke liye hardik pandya jaise kadran nausikhiye khilaadi par bharosa karnaa, har gend par khud jaakar gendbaaj ko apni ranneeti samajhaana, aakhri gend se pehle hi aage kii sochakar dastaana utaar lenaa, or ant main behad tej bhaagate hue out karnaa or bharat ko lagbhag 'asambhav' ban chuki jeet dilaanaa
 
 
 We have been very happy to read what the fans wrote for Dhoni on Twitter and Facebook, so now, you can also read

 And not just micro-blogging site Twitter, Facebook also did not appear to be crazy about Dhoni
 
 
 khayr, aisa to hona hi tha, kyonki mahendra singh dhoni ne jo kiya, vah sachmuch behad avishwasaneey tha
 
 
 Keeping calm in the midst of so much tension, relying on a novice player like Hardik Pandya for the last over, getting the bowler to explain his strategy on every ball himself, taking a forward thought before the last ball, and finally Running out fast and getting India a victory that is almost 'impossible'
 
 
 dhoni ke liye twitor or fasebuk par prashansakon ne kya-kya likh daalaa, vah padhakar ham to behad aanandit ho chuke hai, so, ab aap bhi padhie

 (input from IANS) 28 hafte ke garbh ko liye 24 varshiya mahila apane or bachche ke bhavishya ko lekar chintit he
 The story of this 'nirbhaya' of Gujarat is also very painful
 gujarat ke botad zile ke devlia gaanv kii rahanevaali 24 varsh kii is mahila ko pichley saal july main gujarat ke surat se agava kar liya gaya tha
 For about 8 months, 7 kidnappers took her to different places and raped her
 police ne bhi use dhundne ke liye koi thos karrwai nahin kii
 a social worker pleaded with the police several times, and a report of his disappearance was also recorded
 lekin jaanch kii koi koshish nahin hui jisase is mahila kii zindagi main andhera chaa gaya
 After all, in March this year she somehow escaped the clutches of the kidnappers after saving her life
 lekin tab tak wo 24 hafte kaa garbh apane main samete hue thi
 When she went home, the husband refused to adopt the miscarried pregnancy
 mahila ne pehle nichali court main guhaar lagaai ki use garbhpaat kii anumati di jaay kyonki ye baccha uske saath hue dushkarm kii vajah se ho rahaa he, lekin court ne uski apil thukraa di
 Finally, 'nirbhaya' also pleaded in the Gujarat High Court to allow her to have an abortion
 tippaniyan Doctors expressed the opinion that since the womb has become very large, Nirbhaya's life may be threatened in getting an abortion
 lihaaza hai court ne bhi 'nirbhaya' kii suraksha ke maddenzar use garbhpaat na karne kaa faisla sunaaya
 At the same time, the court has also given strict instructions to the state government that the safety and responsibility of this woman and her child rests with the state government and their future should be taken care of
 nirbhaya ne apane pati ko samajhane kii koshish kii he, lekin uskaa pati dushkarm ke parinamswaroop paidaa ho rahe is bachche ko apnaane ko taiyaar nahin he
 Her husband is saying that if the court has given the order then he will surely assure that the birth of this child will be fine, but after that the decision of the future of that child will be taken by the elders of his society
 aise main 'nirbhaya' apane or bachche ke bhavishya ko lekar behad chintit he

 kareeb 8 mahino tak 7 aparankarta use alag-alag jagah le jaakar uske saath dushkarm karte rahe
 The police also took no concrete action to locate him
 ek saamaajik kaaryakarta ne bahut baar police ke paas guhaar lagaai tab jaakar uski gumshudagi kii report bhi darj kii gayi
 But there was no attempt to investigate which led to darkness in this woman's life
 aakhir is saal march main wo kisi tarah aparankartaaon ke changul se apni jaan bachaakar bhaag gayi
 But by then she was in a 24-week pregnancy
 jab ghar gayi to pati ne dushkarm se panape garbh ko apnaane se inkaar kar diya
 The woman first pleaded in the lower court that she should be allowed an abortion as the child was being raped by her, but the court turned down her appeal
 aakhirkaar 'nirbhaya' ne gujarat hai court main bhi guhaar lagaai kii use garbhpaat kii anumati di jaay
 The comments doctoron ne raay jataai ki chunki garbh bahut bada ho gaya he, aise main garbhpaat karwaane main nirbhaya kii jaan ko khatra ho saktaa he
 Hence, the High Court also ruled that Nirbhaya should not abort in view of her safety
 saath hi saath court ne rajya sarkaar ko bhi sakht hidaayat di he ki is mahila or uske bachche kii suraksha or zimmedaari rajya sarkaar ke hawaale he or unke bhavishya kaa khyaal rakhaa jaay
 Nirbhaya has tried to understand her husband, but her husband is not ready to adopt this child born as a result of rape
 uskaa pati kah rahaa he kii court ne aadesh diya he to wo ye aashwast zarur karegaa ki is bachche kaa janm thik thaak ho jaay lekin uske baad us bachche kaa bhavishya kya hoga iskaa faisla uske samaaj ke buzurg lenge

 Taxpayers of unauthorized colonies, regular unauthorized colonies, urbanized villages and rural villages do not have much tendency to deposit house tax, due to which the penalty on them increases with interest
 ye yojana laayi gayi he taaki bina byaaj or jurmaane ke kaaran hi sahi sampatti dharak kam se kam property tex hi jamaa kar den

 raja kii ore se pesh hue varisht adhivaktaa susheel kumaar ne sibiai ke vishesh nyaayadhish ko bataaya, ‘aaj main bataa dena chahta hum ki main prime ministir, tab ke finance ministar yaa vartmaan ke telecom ministar ko bataur gavaah banaaunga
 He said that at the time it would be proved that there was no loss to the treasury, the entire case of fraud and conspiracy in spectrum allocation would be over and the Prime Minister and two other ministers would be able to prove it
 kumaar ne kaha ki raja sibiai se kuch khaas dastavej hasil karne ke liye siarpisi kii dhara 91 ke tahat aavedan karenge jo ab tak adaalat ke samaksh nahin laae gaye hai
 The defense counsel also raised the issue of stake sale by Swan Telecom Private Limited and Unitech (tamil Nadu) Wireless Private Limited to Dubai-based Etisalat and Norwegian-based Telenor respectively and noted that there was no criminal offense in the transaction

 ’kisi karporate house kaa naam liye bagaiyr susheel kumaar ne aarope lagaaya ki raja ko doorsanchaar kshetra ke bade khilaadiyon ko naaraaz karne kii keemat adaa kerani padi he
 The defense counsel sought to put an end to the cbi's charge of Raja taking bribe and said that the agency should explain why a minister would take bribe through installments in the form of checks and loans
 unhone sibiai ke is aarope ke sadanrbh main yah baat kahi ki dramuk sanchalit kalenganor tivi ne ghotaale ke kathith labhaarthi shahid osman balava kii companiyon ke jariye 200 karod rupee kii rishwat lee
 Raja's lawyer also alleged that as far as other companies like Unitech and Reliance Telecom Ltd (RTL) are concerned, the CBI has failed to prove "any motive" for issuing licenses
 unhone kaha, ‘jahaan tak unitech kii baat he to aisa kuch nahin he ki hamane ek duusare ko phayda pahunchaaya
 The CBI has nothing to show what my motive and advantage was in issuing the UAS license to Unitech
 ’bachaav paksh ke vakil ne kaha ‘‘jahaan tak reliance telecom limited or iske teen adhikariyon kii baat he to ricard main koi saamagree nahin laai gai he ki meraa kya makasad tha
 Even the CBI does not say anything about RTL what it earned
 ’ unhone yah bhi aarope lagaaya ki yadi sibiai ke nuksaan siddhant ko sahi bhi maan liya jaae to sirf do companiyaan swaan telecom or unitech hi is adaalat ke samaksh kyon hai

 Former Rajasthan Chief Minister and State BJP President Vasundhara Raje has triggered the campaign for the December 2013 Assembly elections
 unke abhiyaan kaa naam he 'suraaj sankalp’ yani sushasan ke liye abhiyaan, jo rajya main 13,000 kimi kii yatra par 4 april ko niklaa he or iskaa samaapan 21 july ko hoga
 The yatra has caused uneasiness in the entire Congress, including Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot and they are now splurging to take out their yatra, but Raje has won by taking the yatra first
 vasundhara kii yatra ko acha-khaasaa samarthan mil rahaa he
 The yatra started from Charbhuja, a major religious center in Udaipur zone, where a huge crowd of supporters gathered
 isamen zyaadaatar yuva or mahilaayein thim
 There was so much support that vehicles were jammed on the way to the rally
 party kaa daawa he ki jaipur main jab yah yatra khatm hogi, to isse bhi badi raily vahaan dekhne ko milegi
 Raje's team had been engaged for the last two months in preparation for this trip
 iskaa pehla charan 16 april ko adivasee ilaake mewar main khatm hoga
 Gulabchand Kataria, a BJP organizer and Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly, wanted to take out a yatra in May last year with the support of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), due to which Vasundhara resented and threatened to leave the party
 kataaria uske baad se anushaasit ho gaye hai
 Now he wants Vasundhara to lead the area himself and tell the public how Gehlot has neglected Mewar and he has not been able to get the benefits of the tribals
 raaje ko pehali baar 2003 main rajya kii raajnneeti main bhaironsingh shekhavat ne apane virodhiyon ko nicha dikhaane ke liye utaara tha
 Raje suddenly became popular, due to which the party adopted him as an alternative to Shekhawat
 tab tak shekhavat bharat ke uparashtrapati ban chuke the
 Removing himself from the shadow of Shekhawat, Raje gave the BJP a record 120 seats in 2003

 At the same time, now Bukkal Nawab is calling him a Muslim
 ab to sarkaar main hi ekajutata nahin dikh rahi he
 Let the famous BJP MLA Bukkal Nawab say that Hanuman ji was a Muslim according to him
 bukkal nawab ne kaha, 'hanuman ji hamaare hisaab se musalmaan the
 Therefore, the names that are kept in Muslims i
e
 Rahman, Furqan, Zeeshan, Armaan etc are at least 100 names, which will be found only on Hanuman ji
 isaliye ham samajhate hai ki hanuman ji musalmaan the
 He argued that the remaining names of Hanuman would not be found in the Hindu community
 hindu bhai hanuman naam to rakh sakate hai lekin sultan, armaan, rahamaan nahin rakh sakate
 These are similar names to Hanuman ji
 bhagwaan hanuman kii jati ko lekar to haal main khub siyaasi bayaanbaji hui he, lekin unke dharm ko lekar yah pehla bayaan aayaa he
 Please tell that earlier, the Chief Minister of UP had called Hanuman ji a Dalit

 The results of the assembly elections held in five states of the country will come on December 11, but before that the exit poll on Friday does not have good signs for BJP
 madhya pradesh, chhattisgarh or rajasthan kii satta par kabiz bijepi kii vidaai hoti najar aa rahi he
 Whereas the Congress seems to be returning to the throne of power with full grace
 aise main agar Exit Polls chunavi nateezon main tabdeel hote hai to phir bijepi shasit rajyon main haar kaa thikra kiske sir phutegaa? is sawaal ko lekar bijepi main bechaini badhanaa swaabhaavik he
 'not hating Modi, Vasundhara Teri Khair Nahin' According to India today-axis My India exit poll, BJP in Rajasthan is seen getting beaten up
 soobe kii kul 200 vidhansabha siton main congress ke khate main 119 se 141 siten jaati dikh rahi hai
 The BJP may get 55 to 72 seats under the leadership of Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje
 yahi nahin, baaki aae eczit pole main bhi bijepi kii haar dikh rahi he
 Whereas BJP won 163 seats in the 2013 assembly elections
 aise main sawaal uthta he ki eczit pole agar nateezon main badalte hai to rajasthan main bijepi kii haar kaa thikra kiske sir phutegaa
 It will be the responsibility of Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje or the top leader of the party
 haalanki pradesh main 'modi se bair nahin vasundhara teri khayr nahin' ke naare lag rahe the
 Due to this, PM Modi has organized 13 rallies to win Vasundhara Raje in Rajasthan, Amit Shah visited all the districts of the state and performed 38 programs
 vasundhara raaje ne bhi 75 reliyaan kin
 Other party leaders held a total of 222 rallies and 15 road shows
 iske baavjood eczit pole main bijepi kii karaari haar najar aa rahi he
 In such a situation, if the BJP had won, then certainly the credit of the victory would have been given by PM Modi and the top leaders of the party, but who will be responsible for the defeat is the important question
 chhattisgarh main chaaval baba kii vidaayeeindia today-exis maai india agsit pole chhattisgarh kii satta par 15 saal se kabiz bijepi ko karaari maat milti dikh rahi he
 In the 90-member state assembly, the Congress may have to settle for 55 to 65 seats and the BJP only between 21 and 31 seats
 jabaki anya ko 4 se 8 siten milane kii sambhaavna he
 According to the poll, Chief Minister Raman Singh's departure from power is certain
 chhattisgarh main Exit Poll nateezon main tabdeel hote hai to phir haar kii jimmedaari kiski hogi
 There was neither an anti-incumbency wave against Chief Minister Raman Singh nor any kind of rebellion in the party
 iske baavjood eczit pole main haar hoti dikh rahi he
 In such a situation, who will be responsible for the defeat again
 jabaki piem modi or amit shah sahit party ke kai netaaon ne kai reliyaan kii hai
 The path of Mama Shivraj in Madhya Pradesh, the fort of the BJP, which has been in power in Madhya Pradesh for 15 years, seems to be in need
 india today-exis maai india agsit pole ke mutabik pradesh main congress or bijepi ke bich kaante kii takkar he
 But the Congress is ahead with a slight lead
 pole ke mutabik 230 sadasyeey vidhansabha main bijepi ko 102 se 120 seat or congress 104 se 122 siten milane kaa anumaan he
 While the BSP is expected to get 3 and others 3 to 8 seats
 sanad rahe ki 2013 ke chunaav main bijepi ko 165 or congress ko 58 siten mili thim
 Shivraj Singh Chauhan is the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh for the last 13 years
 shivaraj ke khilaaf bhi na koi khaas sattavirohi lahar or na hi party main koi chunauti dikhi
 Modi also praised Shivraj's performance in his election rallies
 iske baavjood eczit pole main empi main bijepi se aage congress dikh rahi he
 If the results are like this then who will be responsible? 2019 se pehle haar kii jimmedaari par sawaldarasal paanch rajyon ke vidhansabha chunaav ko 2019 kaa semifile mana ja rahaa he
 In such a situation, if the three bjp-ruled states come out of his hands, then it will also have an impact in the Lok Sabha elections
 aise main bijepi ke aalaa netaa kabhi nahin chahenge ki haar kii jimmedaari rashtriya netritv yaa phir narendra modi ke sir phute
 In this case, the three Chief Ministers may have to tie their heads to 'sehra'

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday launched the 'india Post Payments Bank' (IPPB) in Delhi
 isaki deshbhar main 650 shakhaaen or 3250 acces point hai, jahaan samanaantar rup se shubharambh kaarykram yojit kiye gaye
 During this time, PM Modi attacked the Congress fiercely and spoke on many issues
 IPPB ko launch karte hue piem modine kaha ki ek sitambar 2018 ko desh ke itihaas main ek abhootpurv suvidha kii shuruyaat hone ke rup main yaad kiya jayega
 With this, all 1 in the country
 55 lakh daakghar 31 disambar 2018 tak ipeepibi pranali se jud jaaenge
 Read 10 big things about PM Modi's speech
 
 
 1
 Since independence, till the year 2008, the banks of the country gave only 18 lakh crore rupees as loan
 lekin saal 2008 ke baad ke chah varshon main ye raashi badhkar 52 lakh karod rupee ho gai yani jitna lone bainkon ne aazaadee ke baad diya tha, uskaa doguna lone pichhali sarkaar ke chah saal main baant diya
 2
 hamaare desh main phone banking kaa prasar us samay utana nahin hua tha, lekin namadaaron ne phone par banking or phone par karj dilwane shuru kar die the
 Any big industrialist who wanted a loan, he used to call the bank from the Namdars
 bank vaale phir us vyakti yaa uski company ko jhat se karodon rupee kaa karj de dete the
 The phone banking of the Congress and its nominees caused great harm to the country
 3
 The banks, knowing that the loan given by them, would be difficult to repay, but after the order of a family gave loans to special people
 itnaa hi nahin, jab aise log difolt karne lage, to bainkon par dabaav banaakar unhen nae lone dilaae gaye
 This happened in the name of restructuring the Gorakhdhandha loan
 4
 Action started against the 12 big defaulters, who were given loans before 2014, whose NPA amount is around Rs
 2 lakh crores and the results are visible today
 isi prakaar 27 or bade lone khate hai, jinamein ek lakh karod kaa enpie he
 Arrangements are also being made for its return
 jinako lag rahaa tha ki namdaar parivaar kii sahabhaagita or meharbaani se unako mili lakhon-karod rupee hameshaa-hameshaa ke liye unke paas rahenge, hameshaa inakming hi rahegi, ab unke khate se outgowing bhi shuru hui he
 5
 endie kii hi sarkaar NPA kii sachai, pichhali sarkaar ke is ghotaale ko desh ke saamne lekar ai
 We have not only detected the disease, but also found its cause and have also taken steps to correct that disease
 pichley chaar saal main 50 karod se bade sabhi lone kii samiksha kii gai he
 It is being ensured that the loan conditions are strictly adhered to
 hamane kanoon badale, bainkon ke marjar kaa nirnay liya or banking sector main profeshnal approach ko badhaava diya
 6
 congress desh kiarthvyavastha ko eclandminepar baithakargai he
 At the same time, if the truth of this was kept in front of the country and the world, then there would have been an explosion that the economic system could not be achieved
 bahut aihtiyaat ke saath is sankat se desh ko baahar nikaala gaya
 India Post Payment Bank is going to make a big change in the country's economy and social system
 hamaari sarkaar ne pehle jandhan ke madhyam se karodon garib pariwaron ko pehali baar bank pahunchaaya or aaj se bank ko hi gaanv or garib ke darvaaze par pahunchane kaa kaam shuru ho gaya he
 7
 jo log banking dhokhadhadi ke gorakhdhandhe main lage the, unhen bhi acchhee tarah pataa tha ki ek din unki pole khulegi
 Hence, another conspiracy of rigging was hatched at the same time
 bainkon kaa diya kitna karj waapas nahin aa paa rahaa, iske sahi aankade desh se chhipaae jane lage
 When our government was formed in the year 2014, the whole truth started to be revealed, then banks were strictly asked to assess accurately how much of their amount got stuck due to giving such a loan
 8
 Our government has brought the country's banks to the doorsteps of the poor
 varanaa chaar-paanch saal pehle tak to aisi sthiti bana di gai thi ki bainkon kaa adhikansh paisa sirf unheen amir logon ke liye rigerv rakh diya gaya tha, jo ek parivaar vishesh ke kareebi the
 9
 IPPB ke launch hone ke baad ab daakiya chalata phirata bank ban gaya he
 He said that people's trust in the government may have been shaken, but never shook towards the postman
 pehle daakiya ko chor or daaku bhi pareshaan nahin karte the
 IPPB will also prove to be a great facility for farmers
 pradhanmantri fasal beemaa jaisi yojanaon ko isse vishesh bal milegaa
 After the post payment bank, now the claim amount of the schemes will also be found sitting at home

 On the one hand, India performed its best so far in the Asian Games on Friday, on the other hand the country has also received a medal from the statistics of the economy

 Vipassana said that she had not attended that meeting
 na hi use is bare main jaankaree he
 She does not remember, she will think and tell
 usne kaha ki vah dere main jarur hoti he, lekin iske alaava bhi kaaphi kaam hote hai
 Having said all this she became silent
 vipashyana ne police ke samaksh sirf mobile phone die jane kii baat ko kabool kii
 He has said that Honeypreet had not handed him any laptop and diary
 jabaki haniprit is baat par adi rahi ki usne sunaaria jail se lautne ke baad apana laptop, mobile phone or diary vipashyana ko saunp di thi
 Vipassane answered the many questions asked to him
 usne adhikariyon se saare jawaab dene ke liye kuch samay die jane kii maang bhi kii
 After questioning, the police sent Honeypreet to judicial custody at Ambala Jail on the court's order
 udhar, haryana police ne saaf kiya he ki vah abhi tak sirf haniprit kaa mobile phone hi baraamad kar pai he
 He has not found his laptop and diary at the moment

 The inclusion of Naresh Aggarwal in the BJP is becoming a problem for the party high command
 videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj ke baad ab do or kaddavar bhaajapa netaaon ne naresh agarwal ke bayaan par naaraazgi jaahir kii he
 Union Minister Smriti Irani and bjp's strong leader Roopa Ganguly in Bengal have objected to Naresh Aggarwal's statement
 sushamaa swaraj ne jataai thi aapattishree naresh agarwal bhartiya janata party main shaamil hue hai
 He is welcome
 lekin jaya bachchan ji ke vishay main unki tippanee anuchit evam asweekaarya he
 - Sushma Swaraj (@sushmaswaraj) March 12, 2018 Shortly after Naresh Aggarwal's statement, External Affairs Minister and senior BJP leader Sushma Swaraj strongly objected to Naresh Aggarwal's statement
 sushamaa swaraj ne twit karte hue naresh agarwal kaa bijepi main swaagat kiya, lekin unhone jaya bachchan par kii gai unki tippanee ko asweekaarya or galat bataaya he
 After Sushma Swaraj, Smriti Irani and Roopa Ganguly have also lodged a protest against Naresh Aggarwal's statement
 smriti irani ne bhi jataayaa aitarajaiany case is in the court of law for 5 years now
 But let my battle not be an excuse to humiliate other women
 In fact let it be a reminder for us that when a woman’s honour is challenged we stand as one in our condemnation irrespective of our politics
 https: / / t

 Referring to the five-year-old case on the objectionable remarks made by Sanjay Nirupam, she said that she would protest if any woman was insulted
 # jayabachchanvery sad comment of Mr Naresh Agarwal
 i do not accept this
 
 this is not bjp leadership i am proud of Jaya di's contribution to the film industry and also as a parliamentarian
 @ bjp4india @ narendramodi @ amitshah @ bjp4bengal @ jayabachhan445we respect you Jayadi— Roopa Ganguly (@roopaspeaks) March 12, 2018 Rupa Ganguly said, not acceptable; Rupa Ganguly condemned Naresh Agarwal's statement saying it is not acceptable
 unhone kaha ki main jaya bachchan ji kaa sammaan karti hum
 i am proud of Jaya Bachchan's contribution to the film industry
 unhone kaha yah bijepi kii leadership nahin he
 This was a statement, which has created a ruckus: Naresh Aggarwal had made objectionable remarks on Jaya Bachchan in gestures, soon after joining the Bharatiya Janata Party
 naresh agarwal ne kaha tha ki dance karne waalon kii vajah se sapa main meraa rajyasabha kaa tikat kaata gaya
 His statement made the party uncomfortable for some time
 naresh agarwal kii baat puri hote hi fouran party pravaktaa sambit paatra ne morcha sambhala or party kaa stand clear karte hue kaha ki bijepi sabhi logon kaa sammaan karti he
 Be it from any class community, or from films
 pehle bhi naresh agarwal ke rahe hai bigade bolbata den ki naresh agarwal ne mahilaon ko lekar ye pehla vivaadit bayaan nahin diya he
 Agarwal has also made abusive remarks in the rape cases earlier
 yahaan tak ki naresh agarwal ne piem narendra modi par nijee tippanee se lekar hindu devi-devataaon par bhi aapattijanak bayaan die hai
 BJP used to criticize Agarwal's statements as SP MP, BJP has criticized many times
 yahaan tak ki rajyasabha main devi-devataaon par kii gai unki tippanee ke liye bijepi saansadon ne ek swar main agarwal se maafee kii maang bhi kii thi, lekin ab vahi agarwal bijepi main shaamil ho chuke hai
 In such a situation, it will be difficult for the party and the high command to digest their false statements

 Sexual Awareness Among the Younger Generation In 2008, India today-ac nielsen-org Marg sex survey showed a lot of change
 survey se maaloom hua tha ki desh bhar ke kishor kis tarah khulepan ke nae daur ko apana rahe hai
 Of the 5,353 respondents, 37 per cent of men and 17 per cent of women claimed to have had sex before they turned 20
 zyaadaatar mahanagaron main mahilaayein vivaah-purv sex ke paksh main dikhin, jinamein 27 fisadi ke aankade ke saath dilli kii mahilaayein awwal hai
 Where the previous generation first had sex after marriage (60 per cent with their wives), sexual awareness for the younger generation is coming from casual relationships, which they call 'friends'
 jis samskruti main sex ke bare main khule taur par charchaa karnaa bhi varjit rahaa he, vahaan sex ab chahunor najar aata he-filmon main, dharawahikon main, media main or park main yuva jode bhi aalinganabaddh najar aate hai
 It is no surprise then that 37 per cent of young couples prefer to discuss their sexual experiences
 par iske baavjood yon sambandhon ke bare main unka najariya saaf haih 83 fisadi log peshewar yon-karmiyon ke saath sex ko sahi nahin maanate, 68 fisadi yon sambandhon main prayog nahin karnaa chaahate, 92 fisadi ne kabhi sex toy kaa istemaal nahin kiya he, 71 fisadi logon ko purush ke upar rahane vaali mudra pasand he, 81 fisadi vishmalingi hai or 86 fisadi samalangikta ke paksh main nahin hai
 The secret of sexual relationships is hidden behind the openness of teen sex that they do not know much about sex

 This survey also revealed that pornographic films are a great source of information
 jahaan 42 fisadi purushon or mahilaon ne kishoravay main pehali baar ashleel film dekhi thi, vahiin 62 fisadi use niyamit taur par dekhte hai
 Whether girls or boys, most viewers watched these films with their friends (around 50 per cent)

 Mukesh, a 19-year-old student of Hansraj College in Delhi, commented on the current phase, "now it is no longer the same as to ask how one feels about having sex
" mujhe jaanane kii ichha he, to main internet par jaakar kisi se yun hi puch saktaa hum
 "so, is it a convenience to ask this question or is a revolution going on silently?" ‘gori tera gaanv bada pyaara, main to gaya maaraa'
 Yesudas, who gave his voice to this and many such superhit songs, is in controversy due to one of his remarks
 mashhoor gayak ne mahilaon ke genes pahanane kaa virodh karte hue guuruuvaar ko kaha ki yah bhartiya samskruti ke khilaaf he
 His statement is being criticized everywhere
 gandhi jayanti ke silsile main ek svaichhik sanstha dwaara tiruvanantpuram main yojit samaaroh main yesudas ne kaha, ‘genes pahanakar mahilaon ko dusron ke liye samasya paidaa nahin kerani chahie
 What is worth covering should be covered
 ’ 74 varshiya gayak ne kaha ki is tarah kii poshaak bhartiya samskruti ke khilaaf hai, jisamen saadagi or saumyata ko mahilaon ke sabase bade gunon main gina jaataa he
 On the other hand, Mahila Congress activists took out a march in the city, protesting the singer's remarks
 mahila congress kii netaa bindu krishna ne kaha, ‘yah puri tarah asweekaarya vichaar he
 It should only be seen as an encroachment of women's rights
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘yesudas mahaan gayak hai or sangeet main unke yogadan par sabhi bharatiyon ko garv he
 It is unfortunate that she has made such anti-women remarks
 ’yesudas ne bollywood main kai behtareen superhit gane gaye hai, jinamein 'chand jaise mukhade pe bindiya sitara', aaj se pehle, aaj se zyada', 'dil ke tukade-tukade karke, muskura ke chal die' aadi ko khub pasand kiya jaataa he
 After the government's decision on Article 370, fake news on social media has also been flooded 
 isi tarah se ek farji video upi ke purv siem akhilesh yadav ko lekar bhi viral hua
 It claimed that the police dragged Akhilesh to the police station to protest against the government's decision on Article 370
 video main dekha ja saktaa he ki akhilesh yadav ko police bheed ke bich se jabaran car main bithakar kahin le ja rahi he, jiskaa akhilesh virodh kar rahe hai
 The claim has been found by the India Today anti-fake News War Room (AFWA) that the viral video is eight years old and has nothing to do with Article 370
 fasebuk pej Modi News sahit kai logon ne is bhraamak video ko share kiya he
 Thousands of people have shared the video so far

 On youtube, we found an eight-year-old video from the Times Now news channel, in which the viral video can be seen

 On that day, Akhilesh Yadav said on this proposal that any decision which strengthen the unity of the country is welcome, but in democracy, no decision should be made without consensus, fear or coercion
 Any move that seeks to strengthen the integrity of India is to be welcomed
 But in a democracy decisions must be made by consensus, not by threat, force or fear
 All parties should be part of talks and due process
 Nothing should be unilateral for that only leads to more strife

 Akhilesh said that he had raised some questions with the government regarding Pakistan Occupied Kashmir, to which he could not get an answer
 isi kaaran se unhone bill kaa bahishkaar kiya
 It is clear here that the Samajwadi Party had opposed the bill on Article 370, but this viral video of the demonstration has nothing to do with Article 370

 The police take out my call details
 ek saal pehle meri bahan kii shaadi main ye mahila ai thi lekin meri baat nahin hui

" is par gupte kaa sidhaa jawaab tha - vah ek bada aadmi he, main use kaise roak saktaa hum
 Ultimately, the board decided that these two players should not be considered for the tour of the West Indies

 The trends in the results of Himachal Pradesh and Gujarat assembly elections show a clear rise in the BJP
 himachal pradesh main bijepi spasht bahumat ko hasil kar liya he par bijepi ke siem pad ke ummidavaar prem kumaar dhumal ke haath se siem kii kursi haath se nikalati dikh rahi he
 In Sujanpur seat, BJP CM candidate Prem Kumar Dhumal lost to Congress candidate Rajinder Singh

 He has also been called to Delhi today and on the other side, Ajay Jamwal, an RSS pracharak who comes from Mandi area

 In the name of Dhumal's defeat and CM, BJP President Amit Shah said that we respect the sentiment of the people

 After the defeat, Prem Kumar Dhumal said that his personal defeat does not matter, the victory of the party is a more important victory

 But at the last moment, Prem Kumar Dhumal was declared as the CM candidate
 dhumal ke naam ke elaan se sabase zyada jhatka jepi nadda kheme ko hi laga tha
 Considering the manner in which the BJP high command had been projecting Nadda in the state for the last two years and giving them responsibilities, the supporters of Nadda were considering their leader as a natural candidate for the post of CM, but given the political equation, Dhumal was asked about the election
 Was thrown into the ground

 The name of Chanda Kochhar, MD and CEO of ICICI Bank, often appears on the business pages of newspapers
 lekin is baar kochar kisi or vajah se khabaron main hai or soshal media par trend kar rahi hai
 The reason is that Kochhar wrote an inspirational letter to his daughter, which is being shared widely on Facebook and Twitter
 banker chanda kochar ne is khat main ek behad safal peshewar banker ke peeche chuphi ek kaamkaaji maa kii manodasha par roshni daali he
 Chanda writes to her daughter expressing her struggles and adoration, 'I remember your board exams and i took leave so that you could leave the examination hall yourself
 lekin tumne kaha ki itane saalon se tum akele jane kii aadi ho gai hum
 i was shocked to hear this
 ' Chanda, while giving the example of her mother, tells the daughter how to maintain courage and perseverance in difficult times, the conditions are better
 unhone likhaa 'parivaar ko akele chalaanaa nishchay hi unke liye mushkil rahaa hoga, lekin unhone hamen is baat kaa kabhi ahsaas nahin hone diya

 It must have been difficult for him to run the family alone, but he never let us realize this
 jab tak ham aatmanirbhar nahin ho gaye, vah mehnat karti raheen

 tumne mujhe mail bheja
 Wrote, 'you never felt that your career is so demanding and stressful

 Later it was discovered that my visit increased the trust of customers towards the bank

 Then they felt that if i can find time for the tournament even in this crisis, it means that the bank is in safe hands

 In return they also gave love and support
 yaad rakhana, sambandh mahatvapurn hote hai
 It is important to take care of them

 main sirf 13 saal kii thi jab achaanak dil ke daure se pita kii mrityu ho gai
 Everything changed in a single day
 teenon bacchon ko sanbhaalane kii jimmedaari maa par gai
 Then we realized how strong she is
 unhone textile digining kaa kaam siikhaa or choti si company main naukari karne lageen
 It must have been difficult for him to run the family alone, but he never let us realize this
 jab tak ham aatmanirbhar nahin ho gaye, vah mehnat karti raheen
 i did not know that my mother had so much confidence in herself
 ek kaamkaaji maa ke liye jaruri he ki vah apane kaam kaa asar parivaar par nahin padane de
 Do you remember when my MD and CEO were announced? You were studying in America then
 tumne mujhe mail bheja
 Wrote, 'you never felt that your career is so demanding and stressful
 ghar par tum sirf maa hoti ho
 'you too live your life like this
 maine apni maa se siikhaa tha ki kathin halaat se nipatna or aage badhanaa kitna jaruri he
 Be strong by tackling challenges, don't let them dominate you
 mujhe yaad he 2008 main kaise vaishvik sankat ke baad isiaisiai bank ke astitv par khatra mandaraane laga tha
 Then i talked to the depositors, investors, government and regulators
 ungen bataaya ki bahut kam paisa sankat main fansaa he
 Told the staff that if a depositor comes to withdraw money, talk softly to him, make him sit, give him water
 unhen samajhaayen ki aap jab chahen paise nikaal sakate hai, lekin bank sankat main nahin he
 Your brother had a squash tournament in those days
 main kareeb do ghante ke liye vahaan thi
 Later it was discovered that my visit increased the trust of customers towards the bank
 toornament main ai kai mahilaon ne mujhase poocha ki kya main isiaisiai bank kii chanda kochar hum? maine kaha, haa
 Then they felt that if i can find time for the tournament even in this crisis, it means that the bank is in safe hands
 main offis ke saath maa or saas-sasur ko bhi vakt detii thi
 In return they also gave love and support
 yaad rakhana, sambandh mahatvapurn hote hai
 It is important to take care of them
 kisi se vahi vyavhaar karo jisaki tum unscopeksha karti ho
 Your father never complained when i was out of my house or my career did not progress
 ham donon apane kariyar main vyast the, phir bhi hamane apane sambandhon kaa puraa khyaal rakhaa
 i believe that you will do the same with your life partner if needed
 mujhe yaad he jab tumhaari board parikshaayen hone vaali thim
 i took leave so that i could take you to the examination hall
 lekin tumne kaha ki itane saalon se tum akele pariksha dene kii aadi ho gai ho
 i was shocked to hear this
 phir yah sochakar sukun mila ki mere kaamkaaji hone se tum kam umr main aatmanirbhar ho gai ho
 You also took care of the younger brother, he did not let me miss you
 maine offis main bhi is baat ko lagu kiya he
 i give great responsibility to the youth
 main bhagya main vishwaas karti hum lekin mehnat bhi jaruri he
 Everyone writes their own luck
 apni kismat apane haathon main lo, jo hasil karnaa chaahati ho uskaa sapana dekho or use apane hisaab se likho
 i want you to step on the ladder of success one by one while moving forward in life
 akaash kii ichha rakho lekin us ore dhire dhire badho, apane safar ke har ek kadam kaa anand lo
 Only these small steps make the journey complete
 tippaniyan Remember, good and bad moments will be equally involved in your life and you should face both equally
 jindagi main mili har ek avasar kaa puraa phayda uthaao or har avasar, har chunauti se kuch na kuch siikho

 -your mother unheen dinon tumhaare bhai kaa squash toornament tha
 i was there for about two hours
 baad main pataa chalaa ki mere vahaan jane se bank ke prati graahakon kaa bharosa badha
 Many women who came to the tournament asked me if i am Chanda Kochhar of ICICI Bank? i said yes
 tab unhen laga ki agar is sankat kii ghadi main bhi main toornament ke liye samay nikaal sakati hum to iskaa matlab he ki bank surakshit haathon main he
 i used to give time to mother and mother-in-law with office
 badale main unhone bhi pyaar or samarthan diya
 Remember, relationships are important
 unka khyaal rakhana jaruri he
 Treat anyone you expect from them
 mere ghar se baahar rahane par tumhaare pita ne kabhi shikaayat nahin kii varna meraa kariyar aage nahin badhata
 We were both busy in our careers, yet we took full care of our relationship
 mujhe vishwaas he ki jarurat padane par tum bhi apane jivan saathi ke saath vaisaa hi karogi
 i remember when you were going to have board exams
 maine chuttee lee taaki tumhen pariksha haul tak le ja sakuun
 But you said that for so many years you have become accustomed to taking the exam alone
 yah sunakar mujhe thes-si lagi
 Then i was relieved to think that because of my work, you have become self-sufficient at an early age
 tumne chote bhai kii bhi dekhbhaal kii, use meri kami mahasoos nahin hone di
 i have implemented this in office too
 yuvaaon ko badi jimmedaari detii hum
 i believe in luck but hard work is also necessary
 har vyakti apni kismat khud likhata he
 Take your luck in your hands, dream of what you want to achieve and write it according to yourself
 main chaahati hum ki jindagi main aage badhate hue tum ek ek karke safalataa kii seedhi par kadam rakho
 Desire the sky but move slowly towards it, enjoy every step of your journey
 yah chote chote kadam hi safar ko puraa banaate hai
 The comments yaad rakhana achche or bure pal tumhaari jindagi main barabari se shaamil honge or tumhen donon kaa barabari se saamana karnaa aana chahie

 In Puducherry, the municipal authorities have adopted a strange way to motivate people to build toilets at home
 darasal ujaavar karai nagarpalika ke adhikari svachh bharat abhiyaan kaa jayja lene daure par nikle the
 During the tour, officials found that many homes had no toilets
 aise main adhikariyon ne pair chhukar unase ghar main shauchalay banane kii prarthana karne lage
 Only 232 houses have toilets, let us tell you that in 2015 Puducherry's Ujawar Karai, 952 people were selected, who were given ten thousand rupees for the construction of toilets in the house
 inhone oktober 2017 se pehle khule main shouch ko khatm karne kii shapath lee thi
 But when the officials visited, only 234 families had built toilets in the house
 aise main munisapal kamisionar ne apni team ko in gharon kaa daura karne kaa aadesh diya
 During this, he and other officials held the feet of the family and said that we pray for you to build toilets from home
 shauchalay kaa kaam shuru hone par milegi baaki kistdhikariyon kii is sarprise daure se sabhi parivaar vaale stabdh the
 Especially embarrassed, the family members promised to build toilets at the earliest
 munisapal kamisionar ramesh ne kaha ki vah ek baar phir har ghar kaa daura karenge
 Also, the houses where the construction of toilets would have started, they will get the outstanding installment of ten thousand rupees
 baxur main vikaas samiksha yatra ke dauraan mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ke kafile par hue hamale ke baad vipakshi dal argedy ne aarope lagaaya ki sthaneey police ne nitish ke kafile par patharbaji karne ke aarope main kai mahadaliton kii jamkar pitayee kii
 On Sunday, on the issue of alleged beating of Mahadalits, former Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Yadav has warned Nitish Kumar that if RJD will not fight back in the interest of their interests, if the government takes up lathi on any Mahadalit illegally
 iske liye argedy ke kaaryakarta har tareeke kaa balidaan dene ke liye bhi taiyaar he
 Tejashwi said that to protect the Dalits, it is not a threat to the RJD but a warning to the Nitish government
 nitish kumaar dhyaan se kaan kholkar sun len, agar aage se kisi mahadalit ke upar najayas rup se aapaki sarkaar ne lathi uthaai to rajd unke haqon kii ladaai ladane main kisi bhi prakaar kaa balidaan dene main peeche nahin hategi
 This is not a warning of RJD to protect Dalits
 — Tejashwi Yadav (@yadavtejashwi)january 14, 2018tejasvi aarope nenithish sarkaarper pakshpaat purna ravaiya apnaane kaa aarope lagaate hue kaha ki bihar ke mahadalit tolon main vikaas kaa koi kaam nahin ho rahaa he lekin iske baavjood bhi mukhyamantri rajyabar main choumukhi vikaas kaa besura raag alaap rahe hai
 Tejashwi asked the question, where is the justice done by the government to keep large Mahadalit sections of society bereft of development? If they get on the road to demand for development, then their police run sticks on them and bury them
 purv upmukhyamantritejasvi yadavane kaha ki nitish kumaar ke chhadam vikaas kii pole khul rahi he
 He said that Nitish Kumar should understand that public review of development works in the state and not an officer living in air-conditioned class

 antarrashtriya str par jab uski sabhi koshishen fail ho gayi to ab wo bharat ko badnaam karne ke liye nai-nai chaal chal rahaa he

 Pakistan's human rights minister Shirin Mazri, opposing it, wrote that Twitter also appears to have become the mouthpiece of India's Modi government
 twitor ne hamaare raashtrapati ko notice bhej diya jo behad haasyaaspad he
 Please tell that Pakistan President Arif Alvi had tweeted a video about the situation in Kashmir, which showed the situation after the removal of article 370
 twitor ne aarif alvi ko isi video par notice bheja he, jisamen kaha gaya he ki unhone bhartiya kanoonon kaa ulanghan kiya he

 pakistani twitor ke is kadam se behad baukhala gaye
 For this too, they started blaming India and started saying that most Indians work in Twitter, so the social media accounts of Pakistanis are being deliberately closed

 Intelligence agencies have been surprised by this disclosure by terrorist Yasin Bhatkal, although Bhatkal has not yet told where the explosives held by the Indian Mujahideen have been hidden
 lekin khufia agenciyon ke sutron ke mutabik yaccin bhatkal ne iske alaava kuch or bhi chaunkaane vaale khulaase kiye hai
 According to the training sources, the terrorists present in India have found in the PAK, Bhatkal has said that there are more than 30 such terrorists in different areas of India, who have been given training in Pakistan especially for the bomb blasts
 yaccin bhatkal ke mutabik maujuuda vakt main ye aatanki bam dhamaake karne ke liye puri tarah taiyaar hai
 According to Bhaktal, these terrorists are only waiting for orders
 aatanki yaccin bhatkal ke is khulaase ke baad khufia agenciyon kii neend ud gai he, kyonki bhatkal agar sach bol rahaa he to aatankiyon kii is tabaahi kii sajeesh ko jald se jald rokna jaruri he
 According to sources in intelligence agencies, Bhatkal has also admitted that when Riyaz and Iqbal Bhatkal left the country, the Indian Mujahideen command came with him
 iskaa matlab he ki bharat main indian mujahiddeen kaa network bhatkal hi chalaa rahaa tha, isiilie ab khufia agenciyaan bhatkal se indian mujahiddeen kaa puraa network jaanane ke saath-saath baaki jaankariyaan bhi juta rahi hai
 The name of IM is that of plan ISI
 
 
 bhatkal ne khulaasa kiya he ki bharat main tabaahi machaane ke liye iesai ne project 'karachi' banaaya
 And for this project, IM used to get money from ISI
 aatank kaa aakaa bhatkal, lekin bhatkal ne khud mana he ki uskaa bhi aakaa he, jiske ishaare par wo kaam karata he

 ISI ke liye bhatkal karata tha kamkhufia agenciyon ke sutron ke mutabik iesai ke project karachi ke hi tahat yaccin, riyaj bhatkal or ikbaal bhatkal jaise log kaam karte hai

 yaccin bhatkal ne bataaya he ki iesai ne bharat main dehshat or tabaahi kaa maahaul banane ke liye 2003 main 'karachi' project banaaya tha or paanch saal baad 2008 main indian mujahiddeen ko is project ko bharat main anjaam dene kii jimmedaari di gai
 What is the purpose of the project 'karachi'? According to the intelligence agencies told by terrorist Yasin Bhatkal, the purpose of the Karachi project was to destabilize the Government of India, instill fear in people and carry out terrorist attacks everywhere
 yaccin bhatkal ke mutabik indian mujahidin ko chalaane ke liye iesai puraa paisa detii thi
 ISI is funding IM, Yasin Bhatkal has told that ISI has been funding the project Karachi from the very beginning
 khufia agenciyon ko bhatkal ne ye bhi bataaya he ki iesai se lagaataar mil rahe paise kii vajah se hi iem shuruyaat se hi project karachi main pakistan ke role ko cover karata rahaa he
 The IM was awake after the Surat and Bengaluru blasts failed under the Karachi project, which was why the Jaipur, Delhi and Ahmedabad blasts were carried out in 2008 with complete preparation
 yaccin bhatkal ke mutabik zyada fund ke liye oman ke sarfaraj navaj se bhi baat kii gai, taaki zyada tabaahi ke liye or paisa mil sake

 Congress Vice President, Ahul Gandhi, who came to understand the problems of farmers, was effective in Punjab, this time will tell
 lekin is ek din main kisaanon se baatcheet ke alaava kya-kya hua, yah ham aapako bataate hai
 Rahul arrived in Ambala on Tuesday in the general coach of Kotrain
 yahaan se vah govindgarh or khanna mandi pahunche or kisaanon se baatcheet kii
 At night they had dinner on Cheema Havela of Sirhind
 unhone bhindi kii sabji, pili daal, aalu bhaaji, papad or tandoori roti khai
 According to the army sources of the veteran leaders, it was decided that Rahul would stay at a farmer's house in Punjab
 lekin rahul ke sipahasaalar unke liye ek kisaan kaa adad ghar nahin dhund sake
 During this time, there were a large number of veteran Congressmen with Rahul
 inamen ambika soni, shakeel ahamed, harish choudhary, jyotiraditya sindhiya shaamil the
 The leaders of Punjab included Kuljeet Nagra, Parminder Pinky, Rajender Kaur Bhattal, Sunil Jakhar, Ravneet Bittu, Vijayendra Singla and Brahma Mohindra
 guest house main bhi nahin mila kamrakhaiyr jab thikaane ke taur kisi kisaan kaa ghar nahin mila to rahul chandigarh laute or yahaan uti guest house main cameraa khojane lage
 But there were already rooms booked for the guests of a conference
 iske baad rahul sector-28 ke himachal bhawan kii ore ravaanaa hue
 It is said that he spent the night there
 
 
 
 And when the guard 'bhaiya' was also shocked, the security guard standing outside the Himachal building was shocked when after getting out of his SUV, Rahul asked him how he was going
 jab rahul ne unase kaha ki 'thik ho bhaiya', to unke puraane bhaashanon kii yaad aa gai
 Well, it is being told that Rahul had to come to Delhi with the Shatabdi at 6:50 am
 train se gaye the to train se hi vaapasi kii yojana thi
 But for some reason he could not take the train
 ab subah 8:05 kii flite lekar rajdhani pahunch rahe hai
 Shane Watson has been a strong all-rounder but in Test cricket he could not perform to his full potential
 test maichon main balle se unke pradarshan par najar daalen to aakhri shatak unhone 2013 ke aishez siries mon perth test main banaaya tha
 Watson scored 345 runs in that five-test series
 is series ke baad australia ne bharat, dakshin africa, west indies or england ke khilaaf test siries main hissaa liya lekin watasan inamen kaamyaab nahin hue
 If we look at bowling, then the record of 75 wickets in 59 Tests cannot be said to be very attractive
 in maichon main watasan ne mahaj teen baar pari main paanch wicket chatkaaye
 The best performance of his career was six wickets in an innings against Pakistan, that too in 2010
 iske alaava watasan apane baari bharkam kad lathi ke chalate chotil bhi zyada hote rahe
 This is the reason that in his 11-year Test career, Watson was able to take part in just half of Test matches for Australia
 haalanki watasan ke saath ek badi mushkil ye bhi rahi ki ve apni galatiyon ko sudhaar nahin paae
 Becoming lbw in front of the wicket or losing the wicket carelessly after being set, Watson would have been more powerful if he could have improved it
 tippaniyan Now Watson is also 34 years old, so he has taken the right decision to retire from the Test
 steven smith kii captaini main team ko ab fresh chehron kii zyada jarurat he
 Apart from this, a strong all-rounder like Mitchell Marsh has been all set to replace Shane Watson
 aise main australian team ko watasan kii kami nahin khalegi
 On the other hand, Watson will be able to make some strong performances in odis and T20 cricket due to reduced pressure

 agar gendbaaji ke lihaaj se dekhen to 59 test maichon main 75 wicket kaa record bahut aakarshak to nahin kaha ja saktaa
 In these matches, Watson took five wickets in the innings just three times
 unke kariyar kaa sabase behtareen pradarshan pakistan ke khilaaf pari main chah wicket tha, wo bhi 2010 main
 Apart from this, Watson was also injured due to his heavy height
 yahi vajah he ki 11 saal ke apane test kariyar main watasan australia kii ore se mahaj aadhe test maichon main hissaa le paae
 However, a big problem with Watson was that he could not rectify his mistakes
 wicket ke saamne pagabaadha out hona rahaa ho yaa phir set hone ko baad laaparvaahee main wicket ganvaana, watasan isamen sudhaar kar pate unke aakade kahin zyada damdaar hote
 The comments ab watasan kii umr bhi 34 saal kii ho chuki he, aise main test se sanyas kaa unhone bilkul sahi faisla liya he
 Under the leadership of Steven Smith, the team now needs fresh faces
 iske alaava michel marsh jaisaa joardaar olerounder shen watasan kii jagah lene ko bilkul taiyaar ho chukaa he
 In such a situation, the Australian team will not miss Watson

 White House press secretary Jay Carney told a press conference that the team (special campaign) had the right to kill Laden, provided he had offered surrender
 aisi sthiti main team ko uske samarpan kii peshkash ko sweekaar karnaa padataa, yadi team surakshit tareeke se aisa karne main sakasham hoti
 'carney said in response to a question, the campaign was conducted in a manner that was completely in line with the laws of war
 abhiyaan kii yojana isliye banaayi gayi taaki team puri tarah taiyaar rahe or uske paas laden ko hiraasat main lene kaa samay ho
 He said, there is no question that this campaign was illegal
 bin laden al kaayda kaa pramukh tha, uske sanghathan ne11 sitambar 2001ko hamale kiye
 And Al Qaeda and Laden were constantly planning attacks against the US
 hamane raashtra kii aatmaraksha main yah karrwai kii
 Carney said, the campaign was conducted in such a way that civilians are not harmed as far as possible
 or aisa americanyon ke prati baari khatra uthaate hue kiya gaya
 Even further, according to the laws of war, bin Laden's surrender would have been accepted, provided it was practicable
 unhone kaha ki yadi osama samarpan karata to america ko use surakshit hiraasat main lenaa hota or nyaay ke kathghare main use khadaa karnaa hota
 Rejecting Pakistan's statement of the covert operation as 'unauthorized unilateral action', Carney said the US would continue this policy as it has been highly successful
 karni ne kaha, yah tarika kaaphi prabhavi tha or puri tarah kanoon sammat tha

 Kedar Jadhav has also not performed very well

 On Saturday, at least 17 people, including senior Congress leader Mahendra Karma, were killed in the Naxalite attack
 centre ne in siarpief javaanon ko na keval us kshetra ko niyantran main lene ke liye balki talaashi abhiyaan evam bachaav abhiyaan ke liye bhi bheja he, kyonki aisa andeh he ki kuch log paas ke jangalon main chhipe ho sakate hai
 Official sources said that the top officials of the force deployed for anti-naxal operations will visit the site of the encounter on Sunday

 You are constantly listening and watching the stories of the sky
 uttarakhand ke daaman main faili dard or bechaargi kii tasviren bhi lagaataar aapaki ankhon ke saamne se guzar rahi hai
 But there are also some pictures and stories that after listening and watching you will feel both shame and anger together
 jaraa sochie, laashon ke dher ke bich laalchee insaan, insaanon ko hi nochane-khasotne lage to ise aap kya kahenge? rongte khadey kar dene vaali ye kahani he laashon ke luteron kii
 Nature's havoc on one side, wailing and chanting everywhere
 laashon ke dher ke bich apano ko talashte nidhaal log
 Life struggling to stay alive
 madad ke liye gidgidaati auraten, bachche or buudhe
 And on the other side there are dense forests, rocky mountains and animals in disguise of humans walking in those rocky mountains
 yakeen nahin hota ki aise maahaul main bhi koi insaan insaan ko noch khayega
 But alas this is the truth which is now coming out of the hills of Uttarakhand
 jis vakt aasamaani afat se log jindagi bachaane kii jaddojahad kar rahe the, jis vakt bahut se log aakhri saansen gin rahe the, or jis vakt bahut se logon kii aakhri saansen bhi tut chuki thim, tab thik usee vakt kuch log aise bhi the jo murdon ke badan se jevar noch rahe the, unki jebon se batua nikaal rahe the or jo auraten, ladkiyaan jinda batch kar rasta bhatak gai thim unke saath jor-jabardastee kar rahe the
 The tragedy of the people who came back alive from Devbhoomi, who went on the Char Dham Yatra, is shaking
 in logon ke mutabik kedarnath, badrinaath or gaurikund ke kareeb nepaliyon kaa ek jattha puure do dinon tak lutpaat karata rahaa
 Some people who had reached New Tehri by riding in buses from the hills of Kedarnath were taken off by the Uttarakhand Police already posted there and taken into their custody
 iske baad inaki jama talaashi lee gai
 The police got a lot of cash from these people
 poochtacha hui to ye log sahi-sahi jawaab nahin de sake ki inke paas itane saare paise kahaan se aae? police ko shaq he ki gaye paise lutpaat ke hi hai
 Those who have been robbed of the passengers stranded in the journey
 police ko shaq he ki inamen se kuch nepaliyon ne mahilaon or auraton ke saath jor-jabardastee bhi kii thi
 Therefore, after taking them into custody, the loudspeaker was being announced from place to place, that if someone has been coerced, they should come and identify the accused from these people
 itnaa hi nahin kedarnath or badrinaath se laut rahe kai baba or pujaariyon ko bhi jagah-jagah police ne hiraasat main liya he
 Millions of rupees have been received from him in his talshi
 ek sadhu ke paas se to police ko kareeb ek karod rupee mila he
 He hid these money in a dholak
 police ko shaq he ki ye rupee bhi lutpaat ke hai yaa phir murdon kii jebon se nikaale gaye hai
 Or is it possible that these rupees should be in the temple treasury
 ek taraf laashon kii dher or duusari taraf jeene kii jaddojahad or in sabake bich laashon se kafan or jinda logon se jindagi lutate kuch log
 Seeing these devils roaming in the disguise of humans on the mountains of Uttarakhand, even the real devil would be ashamed
 par kya karen in insaanon kaa? jinhen insaan kehete bhi shame aati he
 On one side, nature's havoc and on the other side humans
 uttarakhand main ai tabaahi ke baad agar hajaaron insaanon ne sailaab main fanse logon kii taraf madad kaa haath badhaayaa, to aise log bhi kam nahin the, jinhone mauka milte hi insaan or insaaniyat donon ko matiamet kar diya
 After losing everything in the flood, the people who were killed, the robbers did not spare such people in the litigants
 ye to rahi jinda logon se hui jyaadati kii baat
 According to the police, there have been reports of gold and silver jewelery being looted in the area by the body of those who died
 police ke hathe kuch aise log bhi chadhe, jinke paas se 83 lakh rupee baraamad hue
 And later during interrogation, he admitted that he had looted the money from the victims of inundation and collected it from the corpses
 yakeenan ye vaakye kisi bhi insaan ko andar se jhakojhoranevaale hai
 One such incident happened to the people who came from Chhatarpur in Madhya Pradesh
 chhatarpur ke ek gaanv se kul 66 log kedarnath ke darshan ke liye aae the
 But only 8 people survived after the inundation
 baaki 58 log kahaan gaye, kisi ko nahin pataa
 But what happened there with these 8 people is also hard to believe
 jaan bachaane ke liye pahaado par chadhe in logon ke saath nepali logon ne lutpaat or marpet kii
 The story that he told himself at Haridwar railway station on the way home was astonishing
 vaise pahaado par badal fatne ke baad jo kahar barapa, uskaa asar kai tarah se insaanon par hua
 The treasury room of the State Bank was also swept away in the inundation at Kedarghati and along with it, 5 crore rupees were washed away
 lekin had to tab ho gai, jab jaan bachaane ko sunsaan biabaan main idhar-udhar bhaag rahi mahilaon ke saath bhi badmaashon ne jyaadati karne se gurej nahin kiya
 Taking advantage of the loneliness and compulsion of many women, the miscreants even perpetrated a disgusting incident like rape of them
 kehete hai kisi kii majaburi kaa phayda uthaanaa thik nahin, lekin jaraa sochie uttarakhand ke sailaab main fanse un logon kii jinhen jinda rahane ke liye 5 rupee kaa biscuit ek hajaar rupee main or 10 rupee kii pani kii bottle do hajaar rupee main kharidni padi
 To say that there were shopkeepers selling them, doing business
 lekin hakeekat main ye bhi the laashon ke lutere
 Uttarakhand Chief Minister Vijay Bahuguna says that the stranded people will get Rs 2,000
 lekin mukhyamantri ji, jaraa ye bhi to jaan lijie ki aapke is do hajaar rupee se fanse hue logon ko milegaa kya
 In Uttarakhand, when the people trapped in the sky were in awe of the rash, at that time there was loot in many places
 lut aisi jise sunakar aap dang rah jaaenge
 You will be shocked and nervous to hear what some people have seen and felt coming back from the face of death in transit
 raste main fanse logon kii maane to har choti cheez ke liye moti rakam adaa kerani padati thi
 It is alleged that the game of Mahaloot was going on in the name of help
 log bhukh-pyaas se behaal the
 Had to do it somehow
 uttarakhand main traasadee ke baad jo halaat bane hai wo ruh kampa dene vaale hai
 The government may be claiming relief on a war footing, but what is the ground reality, those victims of the tragedy are telling
 ucch nyaayalay ke nyaayadhishon kii sevanivritti aayu 62 se badhaakar 65 saal karne ke prastaav ko sarkaar ne manjuuri de di
 a bill to this effect will be introduced in Parliament
 is kadam se desh ke 21 ucch nyaayalayon ke lagbhag 630 nyaayadhishon ko phayda hoga
 Government sources said that the Law Ministry wants to introduce this bill in the monsoon session itself, but it is necessary to take all political parties into confidence to amend the constitution, because the passage of any constitutional amendment bill in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha by two-thirds majority
 mandatory
 sutron ne kaha ki kanoon mantri virappa moili chaahate hai ki sanshodhan karne se pehle ise lekar aam sahmati kaayam kii jaae
 Earlier in 1963, the retirement age of High Court judges was increased from 60 to 62 years
 april 2008 main prastaav ko tatkaaleen kanoon mantri hansraj bharadwaj ne pesh kiya tha lekin aam sahmati nahin ban paane ke kaaran prastaav thande baste main chalaa gaya tha
 Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Monday, while discussing the resolution to weaken Article 370 applicable in Jammu and Kashmir and remove 35A, explained why these special provisions were removed? He said that the people of the valley also have the right to live with the 21st century
 anuchhed 370 ke kaaran sarkaar ke kanoon vahaan nahin pahunch pate
 Modi government wants to give a good future to the youth
 amit shah ne vipaksh ke aaropon kaa jawaab dete hue kaha ki vartmaan main jammu-kashmir main raashtrapati shashan he or us adhikaar ke tahat raashtrapati ke samvidhan aadesh 2019 (jammu-kashmir ke liye) ko sansad ke is sadan main prastutikaran kiya ja rahaa he
 Amit Shah said that Article 370 is already temporary and the temporary system was dragged for 70 years
 unhone kaha ki is sanshodhan se anuchhed 370 ke sirf khand ek ko chhodkar anya khand lagu nahin honge
 Home Minister Shah asked the members opposing the proposal that even though historically the maximum amount of central funds has been given to Jammu and Kashmir, even then it is in the works of development of infrastructure, education, health facilities, employment opportunities etc
 Why not reflected? He said that youth are being used for political gains
 ginaae yah pramukh bindu-1
 In 2009, Parliament gave the right to education to all the children of the country, but the Government of Jammu and Kashmir did not implement it
 ab shiksha kaa adhikaar kanoon kaa laabh ab sabhi kashmiri bacchon ko bhi mil sakegaa
 2
 desh kaa koi naagarik jo jammu kashmir kaa nahin he, rajya main nivesh nahin kar saktaa
 The investment was adversely affected due to land and no property being named to an outsider
 ab nivesh bhi ho sakegaa
 3
 sansad ke donon sadanon se koi kanoon paarit hone par uskaa laabh jammu kashmir ke logon ko nahin miltaa
 Now the laws passed by the Parliament will also be applicable in the state
 4
 Ghulam Nabi Azad says that people of Jammu and Kashmir have also started interstate marriages
 sawaal yah he ki vahaan kii beti kisi duusare rajya ke ladke se shaadi karti he to uskaa sampatti par haq chin liya jaataa he
 Now the state government will not be able to take away any fundamental right
 5
 Dalits and backward, scheduled castes, tribes and other sections of Jammu and Kashmir were not given any benefit of reservation, why? Now everyone will benefit from it
 garib saamaanya varg ko, gurjar muslimon ko, pichde-dalit sabhi jammu-kashmir main iskaa laabh le sakenge
 6
 aatankwaad jammu kashmir main paidaa hua, palaa-badha or charam seemaa par pahunchaa
 Now on the slope
 370 or 35e ke kaaran vahaan ke yuvaaon ko kuch samoohon ne bhramit kiya
 Pakistan took advantage of that
 ab tak 41400 se zyada log maare gaye, kyon maare gaye? kiski niti ke kaaran ye 41400 log maare gaye? 1988 main pakistan ke raashtrapati general jiya ne kaha ki jab tak 370 he tab tak kashmir kaa yuva bharat se aatma se jud nahin saktaa
 The question is that the youth of other states of the country are not misguided because there is no stream creating segregation, hence they used to incite the youth only in Kashmir
 7
 Should Jammu and Kashmir be left to the mercy of fundamentalists, who provoke all their sons and daughters study abroad
 jo 370 banaae rakhana chaahate hai unhone to khub maal kashmir main kama liya
 Having created property abroad, he wants to keep the common youth of Kashmir foolish
 vahaan ke yuvaaon ko acchhee shiksha chahie, vikaas chahie
 We can increase medical and tourism there
 rojgaar badhaane ke liye vahaan nivesh chahie
 Therefore it was necessary to remove the 370's fork
 8
 Nehru ji had said that 370 will be worn out by wear and tear, it was made temporary in the constitution
 ye kehete he ki sardaar patel ne 370 diya, ye galat he
 Sardar made the whole country one more united
 sardaar patel ne kashmir ko deal nahin kiya, unhone junagarh or hyderabad ko deal kiya
 He is with us today
 kashmir ko pandit nehru ne deal kiya to ajtak samasya khadi dikh rahi he
 9
 kashmir main 370 ke kaaran aatankwaad paidaa hua, yah aantak kii janani he, log kehete hai ki 370 bharat ko kashmir se jodta he, yah bhav main hi sahi he
 Not in reality
 bharat kaa kashmir se judaav 370 ke kaaran he
 370 came in 1949 while India and Kashmir were merged only in 1947 due to the letter of Maharaja Harisingh
 10
 The culture of Kashmir is not safe because of 370
 maharashtra, karnataka, tamilnadu samet prayek rajya kii sthaneey samskruti desh main surakshit he to phir kashmir ke logon ko saath kyon nahin rakhaa ja saktaa
 The security of Kashmiri culture can also be like that of the rest of the states
 iske liye 370 ko banaae rakhane kii koi zarurat nahin he
 11
 ram manohar lohia ji ne kaha tha ki jab tak dhara 370 he tab tak bharat or kashmir main ekarupata nahin aa sakati
 Lohia ji said this in the Parliament
 desh ke sabhi pramukh netaaon ne ye baat kahi thi
 12
 aaj 370 ko hataane kaa uchit samay aayaa he
 It could not be removed due to political will
 aaj narendra modi pradhanmantri hai, isliye desh main yah ichhashakti paidaa hui he or grahamantralay ne ise samaapt karne kaa nirnay liya he
 13
 kashmir main aarakshan kaa bill kyon laae, iske peeche kaaran he ki ham yahaan paarit karenge to aasaani hogi
 If the government will be formed then it will now apply to Kashmir on its own
 14
 This is to say to the people of Jammu and Kashmir that Jammu Kashmir is the crown jewel of India
 jammu-kashmir main yadi sthiti saamaanya rahati he to vahaan ham bhi sari sthiti sheeghra saamaanya kar denge
 15
 desh main aazaadee ke baad anek rajyon kaa vibhaajan hua he
 BJP did, Congress also did
 telugana or andhra ke vibhaajan kii tasviir vipaksh ko yaad hogi, kis tarah se tab bill paarit kiya tha
 The broadcast was stopped, the process continued till night in Parliament
 16
 The people of Jammu and Kashmir lived with 370 for 70 years
 ab ham kah rahe hai ki jammu kashmir ke yuva paanch saal hamen dijie, ham dikhaa denge ki jammu kashmir ko kaise desh kaa number ek rajya ham banaaenge
 17
 jammu kashmir samasya ke samaadhaan kaa yahi rasta he
 We have to finish 370
 18
 i pray to the House that we should try to bring normalcy in Jammu and Kashmir
 kashmir kii samasya ke samaadhaan kaa rasta yaheen se nikalegaa
 We must leave the politics of vote bank
 kashmir kii janata ko hamen vaastaviktaa bataani hogi
 Thanks to all those parties, AAP, BSP, BJD, AIADMK supported
 jin dalon ne samarthan kiya, sabhi ko dhanyavad
 Thanks to the people of the country who have welcomed the decision with one voice
 janata kaa drudh vishwaas dekhakar meraa bhi vishwaas bad gaya he
 19
 aaj do sankalp, ek bill or rigerveshan bill hamane sansad main rakhaa he
 Everyone is requested to send a good message to the people of Kashmir
 meraa prastaav he ki donon prastaav par sadan sahmati de or donon bill paarit kiye jaaen
 20
 jab ham kisi nagarpalika kaa chunaav bhi nahin jitate the, tab se hamaare ghoshnaptr main 370 ko hataane kaa mudda shaamil rahaa he
 We believed that the way to 370 is wrong
 aaj to hamen 2014 main, 2019 main desh kii janata ne bahumat diya he
 Notice to the Uttar Pradesh government and the Ministry of Defense, the Supreme Court will hear in January next year, the matter of the proposal to cut about 64,000 trees for the Defense Expo in Uttar Pradesh has now reached the Supreme Court

 ped katwane par roak lagane kii mangashila barase ne supreme court main yachika daakhil kar dephence expo ke liye 64,000 pedo ko kaatane ke prastaav par roak kii maang kii he
 The Supreme Court will hear the case in January next year
 agle saal hathiyaaron kaa sabase bada mela dephence expo lakhanu main lagane ja rahaa he
 The theme of the 11th Defense Expo India -2020, to be held in Lucknow from 5 to 8 February, is 'india: Emerging Defense Manufacturing Center'

 kashmiri ladakiyon ke khilaaf vivaadit tippanee or posterbaji karne ko lekar haryana ke mukhyamantri manohar laal khatter or rajyasabha saansad vijay goyal kii mushkilen badhati ja rahi hai
 The Delhi Women's Commission has taken note of the poster of Rajya Sabha MP Vijay Goel and the controversial remarks of Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar regarding Kashmiri girls
 dilli mahila ayog kii adhyaksh swati maliwal ne dilli police ko notice jari kar turant inke khilaaf exiaar darj karne ko kaha he
 The Commission said that the acts and statements of Vijay Goel and Manohar Lal Khattar have not only tarnished the dignity of Kashmiri daughters and sisters, but have also damaged the honor of all women and girls in the country
 iske alaava inke kaaryon se kashmir ke pehle se hi samvedansheel ilaake main hinsa bhadak sakati he
 Such statements by those in high constitutional positions reinforce the notion of a patriarchal society and weaken the importance and voice of women and girls
 vijay goyal ne apane dilli sthit nivas main kashmiri ladakiyon ke bade-bade hordings laga die hai, jabaki khatter ne ghoshnaa kii he ki ab haryana ke purush kashmiri ladakiyon ko shaadi karke laaenge
 On this basis, the Women's Commission has issued a notice to the Delhi Police and recommended to register an FIR against the two leaders
 dilli mahila ayog ne kaha ki dilli police ko rasikalal dalpatraam thakkar banaam gujarat rajya maamle main supreme court ke faisle ke tahat manohar laal khatter ke khilaaf cese darj karnaa chahie
 In this case, the apex court had said that it is not within the jurisdiction of the investigating agency to refrain from conducting a correct and complete investigation merely because the crime has taken place beyond its territorial jurisdiction
 chunki aaropee vyaktiyon ke bayanon kaa dilli sahit puure desh main mahilaon or ladakiyon par sidhaa or galat prabhaav padataa he, isliye ayog ne is par kadi karrwai karne kii maang kii he
 The Delhi Women's Commission said that at a time when many states are on high alert, such insensitive and inaccurate remarks at the time hurt the sentiments of the entire state
 aisi tippanee hinsa ko bhadakaane kii kshamta rakhti he or isaki turant jaanch kiye jane kii jarurat he
 The commission has asked the police to file firs in the case by 14 September 2019 and give copies of them
 dilli mahila ayog kii adhyaksh swati maliwal ne kaha ki jab anuchhed 370 ke khilaaf kadam uthaane or jammu-kashmir ko ekikrut karne ke liye puraa desh pradhanmantri modi ke saath khadaa he, us samay unki apni hi sarkaar ke kuch log unke prayaason ko kamjor karne kii koshish kar rahe hai
 With their indecent attitude against women, such people are encouraging themselves and others to consider women as property
 ise tatkaal rokane kii jarurat he
 These leaders have hurt not only the Kashmiris but the entire country
 police ko inke khilaaf tatkaal FIR darj kerani chahie
 We will try to take strict action in the matter
 mumbai main aare colony main kaate ja rahe hai pedshivsena pramukh uddhav thakare ne di tikhi pratikriyamumbai main aare colony main pedo ko kaatane par shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare ne tikhi pratikriya di he
 The Shiv Sena chief has said that those who have killed the trees will see them
 maharashtra main vidhansabha chunaav ke liye matdaan se pehle hi shivasena or bhartiya janata party aamane-saamne aa gai hai
 Even though both parties are together in Maharashtra elections, the statements are still going on
 aare main pedo kii kataai ne shivasena ko rashtriya janatantric gathbandhan (endie) kaa netritv kar rahi bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ke khilaaf morcha kholane kaa mauka de diya he
 During this, Uddhav Thackeray has expressed deep displeasure over the cutting of trees
 unhone kaha he ki aare main pedo ko kaatane kaa mudda behad gambhir he
 Uddhav Thackeray said in the midst of the electoral atmosphere of Maharashtra that people who have murdered trees will see them
 vahiin maharashtra chunaav main varli vidhansabha kshetra se ummidavaar or shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare ke bete aditya thakare ne bhi pedo ko kaate jane kaa virodh kiya he
 Aditya has targeted the ally BJP without taking a name
 twit kar unhone kaha ki jis tarah se jangal kaate ja rahe hai usase plastic pradooshan par bolne kaa koi point nahin he
 Trees cut for Delhi Metro as well
 Union Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar said that Delhi Metro is the best metro in the world today
 dilli metro ke liye bhi ped kaate gaye the, us samay bhi kuch logon ne iskaa virodh kiya tha
 He clarified that the Delhi Metro had then planted five saplings instead of one
 aaj vah paudhe ped ban gaye hai
 What is the matter? Trees are being cut in Mumbai's Aarey Colony for Metro
 iske khilaaf lamaband paryaavaran premi or raajnneetik dal virodh pradarshan kar rahe hai
 The Bombay High Court gave its verdict on October 4 after hearing the case
 court ne pedo kii kataai par roak lagane se inkaar kar diya tha
 After the court order, the administration started cutting trees from late in the evening

 During the last hearing, the court termed many remarks made by Arvind Kejriwal's lawyer Ram Jethmalani in the court on Arun Jaitley as defamatory
 court ne kaha ki agar is prakaar kii bhashaa kaa prayog karne ke liye arvind kejariwal kii ore se kaha gaya he tab is maamle main bahes ko aage lene jane kaa koi phayda nahin he
 For information, let us know that the hearing was held on an appeal by Raghav Chadha in which Arun Jaitley's lawyers took up the case
 maamle ke jaj manmohan ne kaha ki aise main pehle kejariwal ko aakar apane aaropon par bayaan dena chahie
 This whole matter came to light when the lawyers who came for debate on behalf of Arun Jaitley told the court that first it should be clear whether the language which Ram Jethmalani is using is being used with the consent of Arvind Kejriwal
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki ram jethmalani yah kah chuke hai ki vah jo kah rahe hai wo arvind kejariwal kii taraf se kah rahe hai
 Jaitley's lawyers said that if Arvind Kejriwal has given permission to use such language against Arun Jaitley, then another 10 crore defamation case will be filed
 iske baad jaj manmohan ne latad lagaate hue saaf kaha ki jab pehle hi manahani kaa cese chal rahaa he tab is prakaar se bhashaa kaa prayog kar kisi kaa apmaan nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 In the court, the judge said that if the same thing happened in a rape case, it would have amounted to torture of the victim
 iske baad court ne kaha ki peedit ke vakil is maamle main doosraa cese bhi kar sakate hai
 Explain that while cross-examining Arun Jaitley in front of the joint registrar of the court, Ram Jethmalani used the word crook (deceiver)
 iske baad jetali or jethmalani main tikhi bahes hui
 Both the team of lawyers had a heated debate and had to postpone the case further
 court ne is maamle main notice jari kar kejariwal ko safai dene ke liye pehle hi bulaayaa he
 For information, let us know that Kejriwal's Advocate on record has clearly stated in the court that Kejriwal has not been asked to use such words in this case
 jabaki ram jethmalani ne court main kaha he ki is prakaar ke cross ikjamination ke liye unhen kejariwal se ijaajat mili he
 The correct disclosure of this will now be done only after Kejriwal's statement in court
 udhar, maamle main ek kanoonee pench yah bhi fansaa he ki kya court main hue is prakaar kii bhashaa ke istemaal par cese kiya ja saktaa he yaa nahin
 Nothing is clear on this yet
 itnaa jarur he ki ram jethmalani kii baat yadi sahi nikali to kejariwal ek or cese jhelenge or agar galat nikali to jethmalani ne vakeelon ke niyamon kaa ulanghan kiya he
 Arvind Kejriwal accused Arun Jaitley of corruption during his tenure in the DDCA and continued to accuse him of scam of several hundred crores from various forums
 bina saboot lagaataar aarope lagane par arun jetali ne unhen pehle to manahani kaa cese karne kii chetavanee di
 Arvind Kejriwal and team took this warning as a threat and presented a challenge that if they go to court there will automatically reveal the truth of the allegations related to the case
 centre kii narendra modi sarkaar main vittamantri arun jetali ne is chunauti kaa sweekaar kiya tha or court main manahani kaa mukadmaa daayar kar diya
 Now the case is going on for the last several months
 arvind kejariwal kii ore se is cese main desh ke jane maane vakil ram jethmalani ne cese main pairvi kar rahe hai
 The comments puure maamle main ram jethmalani or arun jetali main tikhi bahes hui
 The case also came out in one case that the Arvind Kejriwal government of Delhi had paid a bill of crores for the most expensive lawyer of the country, Ram Jethmalani, who was talking about fighting this case for free
 lekin maamla rajyapal ke paas jaakar atak gaya
 Now Arvind Kejriwal as the Chief Minister of Delhi is talking about fighting in this case
 jaankaree ke liye bataa den ki pichley guuruuvaar kii court kii sunwaayee main us samay ek nayaa mode aa gaya jab arun jetali kii ore se bahes kar rahe rajeev nair or sanjeev sethi ne ek aisa prashn puch liya jisase arvind kejariwal kii mushkilen bad gai hai
 Now the Union Finance Minister and Defense Minister and senior BJP leader Arun Jaitley have filed a second defamation case against Arvind Kejriwal today
 yah cese bhi unhone 10 karod rupee kaa darj karaayaa he
 For information, let us tell you that Arun Jaitley has filed this case after Arvind Kejriwal was abused by Arun Jaitley during the cross-examination of renowned lawyer Ram Jethmalani
 pichhali sunwaayee ke dauraan court ne arvind kejariwal ke vakil ram jethmalani kii court main arun jetali par kii gai kai tippaniyon ko nindaatmak qaraar diya
 The court said that if Arvind Kejriwal has been asked to use this type of language, then there is no use to take the debate further in this matter
 jaankaree ke liye bataa den ki sunwaayee raghav chaddha kii ek apil par hui thi jisamen arun jetali ke vakeelon ne yah maamla uthaaya
 Judge Manmohan said that in such a situation, Kejriwal should first come and give a statement on his allegations
 yah puraa maamla tab prakaash main jab arun jetali kii ore se bahes ke liye aae vakeelon ne court se kaha ki pehle yah saaf ho janaa chahie ki jis bhashaa kaa prayog ram jethmalani kar rahe hai kya vah arvind kejariwal kii sahmati se ho rahaa he
 He also said that Ram Jethmalani has said that what he is saying he is saying on behalf of Arvind Kejriwal
 jetali ke vakeelon ne kaha ki arvind kejariwal ne agar aisi bhashaa kaa prayog karne kii ijaajat arun jetali ke khilaaf di he to phir ek or 10 karod kaa manahani kaa cese daayar kiya jayega
 After this, Judge Manmohan lashed out and said that when defamation case is already going on, no one can be insulted by using language in this way
 court main jaj ne kaha ki agar aisa hi kisi rape ke cese main hua hota to yah peedit ke pratadna ke baraabar hota
 After this, the court said that the lawyer of the victim can also do a second case in this case
 bataa den ki court ke sanyukt register ke saamne arun jetali kaa cross-ikjamination karte hue ram jethmalani ne crook (dhokheybaaj) shabd kaa prayog kiya tha
 This was followed by a heated debate between Jaitley and Jethmalani
 donon kii vakeelon kii team main bhi tikhi bahes hui maamle ko aage ke liye taalna padaa he
 The court has already called Kejriwal to give clarification by issuing notice in this matter
 jaankaree ke liye bataa den ki kejariwal ke edwocket ne on record ne court main saaf kah diya he ki is maamle main kejariwal kii ore se is prakaar ke shabdon ke prayog ke liye nahin kaha gaya he
 Whereas Ram Jethmalani has said in the court that he has received permission from Kejriwal for such cross examination
 iskaa sahi khulaasa ab kejariwal ke court ke court main bayaan ke baad hi ho paaegaa
 On the other hand, a legal screw in the case is also implicated whether the use of such language in court can be done or not
 abhi is par kuch bhi saaf nahin he
 It is so certain that if the matter of Ram Jethmalani comes true, Kejriwal will face another case and if it turns out wrong, Jethmalani has violated the rules of the lawyers
 arvind kejariwal ne arun jetali par didisie main pad par rahane ke dauraan bhrashtachar ke aarope lagaae or lagaataar kai manchon se kai sau karod ke ghotaale ke aarope lagaate rahe
 Arun Jaitley first warned him to file a defamation case without any evidence
 is chetavanee ko arvind kejariwal and team ne ek dhamkee ke taur par liya or chunauti pesh kii ki vah court jaaen vahaan par apane aap cese se jude aaropon kii sachai saamne aa jaaegi
 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley in the Narendra Modi government at the Center accepted the challenge and filed a defamation suit in the court
 ab is maamle main pichley kai maheenon se sunwaayee jari he
 On behalf of Arvind Kejriwal, the country's famous lawyer Ram Jethmalani is appearing in the case
 tippaniyan Ram Jethmalani and Arun Jaitley had a heated debate over the entire matter
 maamla ek yah bhi nikalakar saamne aayaa ki jo ram jethmalani is cese ko free main ladane kii baat kar rahe the un desh ke sabase mahange vakil ke liye dilli kii arvind kejariwal sarkaar ne karodon kii fees dene kaa jugad nikaal liya tha
 But the matter got stuck with the governor
 ab arvind kejariwal dilli ke mukhyamantri ke taur par is cese main ladaai ladane ke baat kah rahe hai
 For the sake of information, last Thursday's court hearing took a new turn when Arv Jaitley, who was arguing on behalf of Rajiv Nair and Sanjeev Sethi, asked a question which has increased Arvind Kejriwal's difficulties
 pichhali sunwaayee ke dauraan court ne arvind kejariwal ke vakil ram jethmalani kii court main arun jetali par kii gai kai tippaniyon ko nindaatmak qaraar diya
 The court said that if Arvind Kejriwal has been asked to use this type of language, then there is no use to take the debate further in this matter
