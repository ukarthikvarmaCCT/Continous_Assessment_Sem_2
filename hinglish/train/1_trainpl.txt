 com / hi9jsvu9g3— Satyamev Jayate (@satyamevjayate)september 7, 2014 After summoning the Indian Deputy High Commissioner in Islamabad, Pakistan has once again breached the ceasefire on the international border
 apni harkaton se baj nahin aane vaale padosi mulk ne jammu-kashmir ke poonch main buudhvaar shaam ko ek baar phir firing kii he
 There is no news of any casualty in the latest firing, while the army has retaliated on its behalf
 jaankaree ke mutabik, buudhvaar shaam kareeb 7 bajepunch jileke balakot or hamirpur main seemaa paar se pakistani rangers ne firing kii he
 Firing continues continuously, while the Indian camp has also responded to this firing without any provocation
 islamabad main jataayaa virondilachasp baat yah he ki pakistan ne buudhvaar din main hi islamabad main bhartiya up ucchayukta jepi singh ko talab kiya tha
 During this time, the Pakistani Foreign Ministry accused the firing of Indian soldiers Parbina abetment and protested against the killing of a soldier due to firing
 aise main seemaa or siyasat ke str par pakistan ke doharaa ravaiya ek baar phir jagajaahir hua he
 It is also important that in the past, there has been a dg-level dialogue between the two countries in Delhi, in which a new agreement has been reached about the ceasefire
 lekin baavjood iske padosi mulk uske baad se lagaataar sijafire kaa ulanghan kar rahaa he
 For the last few days, continuous firing on Tuesday, there was also firing from Pakistan in Krishnaghati area of poonch
 mangalvaar kii ghatana ke babat raksha pravaktaa ne bataaya ki pakistani sainikon ne subah kareeb saat baje krishna ghati main niyantran rekha par agrim chaukiyon par swachaalit hathiyaaron se golibari kii or mortar daage
 Pak troops used 82 mm mortar bombs
 pravaktaa ne bataaya ki pakistani sainikon ne somvaar shaam chah bajkar 20 minute se nau baje tak balakot sector main niyantran rekha par agrim chaukiyon ko swachaalit hathiyaaron se nishaanaa banaaya
 He said that Indian troops stationed on the Line of Control retaliated and the firing continued till the last news came from the area
 'oparation chaar disambar' ek aisa daraavna sach he jo agar sahi sabit ho jaataa to desh ko khun ke aansu rulaa jaataa
 There was an assembly election in Delhi on December 4 and a dreadful plot was hatched on the same day
 phone par do log baat karte hai
 The conversation mentions wedding preparations
 shaadi kii taarikh par baat aati he to jawaab miltaa he, vahi jo pehle se tay he- 4 disambar ko
 Congratulations are received from the other side and the phone is cut off
 yah baatcheet behad aam he
 So much so that anyone could understand that two people are talking about preparing for marriage on the phone
 lekin is maamuli si baatcheet ne hindustan kii khufia agenciyon ko ek bhayanak aatankwaadi hamale kaa wo plan de diya, jo agar kaamyaab ho jaataa to har taraf laashen bich jaatin
 The plan was a terrorist attack to be carried out in the capital Delhi
 pakistan main baithe the aakadarasal, yah phone pakistan se aayaa tha
 On the other hand, Javed Baluchi, the commander of the terrorist organization lashkar-e-taiba, was in talks with Subhan, a suspected terrorist present in Mewat near Delhi
 shaadi kii taiyaari or taarikh kii baatcheet ke peeche dilli vidhansabha chunaav ke din bada hamalaa karne kaa plan tha, lekin code-language main ho rahi is baatcheet ko naa sirf khufia agenciyon ne intercept kar liya, balki 4 disambar se pehle hindustan main baithe lashkar ke kathputliyon tak pahunch kar is sajeesh ko benakaab bhi kar diya
 Intelligence Bureau, ie the IB intercepted the call and on the other hand, the Special Cell of the Delhi Police team left for Mewat to nab the faces involved in this conspiracy
 vahaan se police ne subhaan ke do saathiyon rashid or shahid ko to giraftaar kar liya, lekin subhaan faraar hone main kaamyaab ho gaya
 ATS teams from Delhi and Rajasthan are continuously raiding for Subhan's arrest
 mujffarnagar main dange ke shikaar naujavaanon par thi najaramevaat main rashid or shahid kii giraftaar se police ne aatank ke is modul ko dhwast kar diya
 The police contacted all the people in contact with the arrested people
 yaheen police ko pataa chalaa ki rashid or shahid devband bhi gaethe
 The two also came in contact with Likayat, a teacher from Deoband and Jamir, another man for Deoband
 police sutron ke mutabik lashkar-e-taiyaba kii najar mujffarnagar danga peediton par thi
 These people were contacting the riot victims to join Lashkar at the behest of their masters
 sutron ke anusaar mevaat se giraftaar shahid ke paas ek diary bhi mili he jisamen mujffarnagar ke kai ladakon ke naam hai
 Rahul Gandhi's statement proved to be true The Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi's statement on which political earthquake had come a few days ago, in the investigation of intelligence agencies finally proved the same thing
 ye saaf ho gaya ki pakistan main baithe aatank ke aakaaon ne hindustan ko lahuluhan karne kaa jo rasta chunaa tha, use dange kii maar se tadap rahi mujffarnagar kii galiyon se ho kar hi guzarana tha
 Rahul Gandhi gave a statement three months ago that he has received information that the terrorists are trying to contact the riot victims of Muzaffarnagar
 unhen bahakaane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 However, the Uttar Pradesh government is denying the Muzaffarnagar connection of Lashkar
 upi sarkaar ke pradhan sachiv eke gupta ke anusaar, 'camp main danga peediton se aatankiyon ke sampark karne kii koi khabar nahin he
 We have spoken to the DM of Muzaffarnagar and Shamli, they too have no such knowledge
 hamen naa to centre sarkaar ne jaankaree di, or naa hi dilli police ne
 'terror conspiracy on the basis of hate politics and politics have their place, but the matter of concern is whether terrorists are now plotting terror on the basis of hate
 hamaare aapasi bhaichaare kii jo ek khaayi, galatchhemiyon kii vajah se paidaa hui, kya vaaki padosi desh ke aatanki sanghathan use chaudaa karne main lage hai
 Then whether the Congress pats its back and the other political parties tell it anything, but the common man will have to be cautious
 aaj suraksha agenciyaan chaukas thi, chaukanni thi, lekin aage puure desh ko chaukas rahanaa hoga

 a month after the Lok Sabha election results came, the former CM has shocked everyone by saying that BJP leaders had sought his help to defeat Saroj Pandey on the Durg Lok Sabha seat
 unhone yah bhi daawa kiya ki bijepi netaaon ne iske liye paise kii peshkash kii thi
 Jogi's statement came at a time when there is a whisper in the BJP over Saroj's defeat
 soobe kii 11 loksabhaa siton main se keval durg main bijepi kii haar hui he
 The difference of victory in seven seats is lakhs of votes
 narendra modi kii lahar ke baavjood durg main saroj pandey kii haar par jogi kaa kahana he ki congress se zyada gutbaji bijepi main he
 Saroj Pandey did not want the people of his own party to win
 chunaav ke dauraan kuch bijepi netaa unke sampark main aae, unhone saroj pandey ko haraane ke liye paise dene kii baat bhi kahi
 Jogi said that the treachery was not only in Congress, but also in BJP
 kai jagah iskaa asar dikhaa
 It was seen more in the fort
 jogi ke is bayaan par congress ke pradesh adhyaksh bhupesh baghel ne kisi tarah kii tippanee karne se inkaar kar diya
 However, the BJP has rejected Jogi's claims
 bijepi ke pradesh sanghathan mahaamantri rampratap singh ne kaha ki congress apni haar kii samiksha kare
 The BJP contested with solidarity and also won
 ek seat haar gaye, isliye gutbaji kahana galat he
 There was unity rather we won 10 seats
 congress khud pichley teen chunaav se ek hi seat jeet rahi he
 However, after this statement of Jogi, there is a possibility of stir within BJP as well as within Congress

 Ratan Tata himself, in an interview at CNN International's Talk Asia event at the time, considered Noel to be his successor in the Tata group, but was killed by Cyrus Mistry

 Arvind Kejriwal presented to the public of Delhi his 18 promises and the evidence to fulfill those 18 promises
 arvind ke puraane sahyogi or bijepi ke nae saathi ashvini upaadhyaay ne un 18 vaadon kii pole khol di
 As a policy, the BJP has started 'AAP' with the help of its old leaders
 'jo kaha, so kiya
 
 
 If the posters of Kejriwal bearing this tag line were set in Delhi, then the BJP was heartbroken
 kejariwal apane 49 dinon kii dastaan suna rahe hai or bijepi us dastaan ko dhul main milaane kaa rasta talash rahi he
 The party has roped in Kejriwal's old partner and aap's founding member Ashwini Upadhyay
 ab ashvini kejariwal ke kaha or kiya ke daavon kaa dam nikaalane main jute gaye hai
 Delhi BJP spokesperson Ashwini Upadhyay says, 'what have you done? He threw dust in people's eyes
 18 muddon par sarkaar banaai thi, un 18 muddon main se koun se puure hue
 Fooled people on water electricity
 aam aadmi ke prachaar abhiyaan ne bijepi main khalabali machaa di he, kyonki isamen kejariwal ne daawa kiya he ki unhone jo vaade kiye, unhen puraa kiya
 Reduced electricity bills
 pani ke bill khatm kiye or muft pani dene kaa vaada nibhaayaa
 Eliminated corruption and curbed inflation
 bijepi kii phikr isliye bad gai he kyonki ye saare mudde aam logon se jude hai or raajnneetik taur par behad ahm he
 That is why the BJP is preparing a strategy to surround Kejriwal and his party on these issues
 dilli bijepi pravaktaa praveen kapur kehete hai, ' unhone kya kiya, janata kaa paisa nijee bijli companiyon ko diya or juthi vaahvahee lee
 People did not get the benefit of getting water free
 'bijepi ke purv vidhayak o pi sharma ne kaha, 'kejariwal to ranchhod laal he, unki baton par kya bharosa karnaa
 Elections may be held again in Delhi, but this time the issues will be related to water and electricity
 aise main bijepi kii koshish inhen muddon par kejariwal ko uljhane kii rahegi
 49 days have been Kejriwal's weakness, but now the Aam Aadmi Party has entered the electoral fray by making these 49 days its strength
 haryana kii 90 vidhansabha siton par daale ja rahe vot24 oktober ko aaenge nattejey, hai profile siton par najrenharyana ke siyaasi ran main congress satta main vaapasi kii jaddojahad kar rahi he
 At the same time, in order to surround the Congress veterans in this political battle, the BJP has created a conspiracy
 aise main congress kii hai profile maane jane vaali siton par kaante kii takkar dekhne ko mil sakati he
 Former Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda is in the fray as the big face of the Congress in this election
 vahiin, mukhar vaktaa randeep surajevaala phir kaithal se daavedaari pesh kar rahe hai
 Voting is currently going on in the state and the results will be out on 24 October
 gadhi saanpala- purv siem bhupendra singh hoodaharyana kii gadhi saanpala vidhansabha seat rohtak jile ke tahat aati he
 This is considered a high profile seat due to former Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda being an MLA from here
 hariyaan ke do baar siem rah chuke hooda ek baar phir isi seat se chunavi maidan main hai
 At the same time, BJP has left INLD to challenge Hooda in the electoral arena and has fielded Satish Nandal
 nandal is seat par hooda ke khilaaf 2009 se lagaataar chunavi maidan main utar rahe hai, lekin abhi tak maat nahin de sake hai
 BJP strategists see this as a chakravyuh against Hooda
 sabhi tarah ke raajnneetik guna bhaag ke baad hi mukhyamantri manohar laal khatter ne yah bayaan diya tha ki kiloi seat kaa parinaam duniya dekhegi
 Along with Hooda, Satish Nandal also comes from the Jat community
 jat voton ke ek tay pratishat ke alaava, brahman, vaisya, essi or pichde voton ko bijepi apane paale main maanakar chal rahi he
 Recently, in the Municipal Corporation elections, Satish Nandal had fielded his son Sanchit Nandal, who had performed well

 a total of 14 assembly elections have been held on Kaithal Assembly seat so far, out of which Congress has won 8 times
 haalanki badale hue sameekaran main bijepi kaaphi majboot sthiti main he
 In such a case, a two-way chakravyuh has been created against Surjewala

 Former Chief Minister Chau

 Kiran Chaudhary, who is handling Bansi Lal's legacy, is currently an MLA and the party has once again fielded him from Tosham seat
 kiran choudhary ko unheen ke garh main gherne ke liye bijepi ne shashi ranjan parmaar, inelo ne kamala par daanv lagaaya he
 Tosham seat has been occupied by Congress since 2000 and Kiran Chaudhary has been MLA since 2005, but it is not easy for Congress to save this seat in the changed political equation
 adampurharyana kii adampur seat bhajanlaal parivaar kii paramparaagat seat maani jaati he
 Hari Singh won the Adampur seat in the first election in 1967 and reached the assembly, but since then, the Bhajan Lal family has dominated the seat till date
 is baar ke vidhansabha chunaav main apana paariwarik garh bachaane ke liye bhajanlaal ke putr kuldeep bishnoi congress pratyaashee ke taur par maidan main utre hai
 Not only do they have to work hard, but they are camping in Adampur along with their family for the last three months

 Kuldeep Bishnoi's wife Renuka Bishnoi became MLA from Hansi in the 2014 assembly elections
 sonaali faughat bollywood celebrati hai or tik-tok se mashhoor hai
 His name was running Barwala lightly, but the BJP has surprised everyone by giving him the ticket of Adampur

 BJP has bet on Sunil Yadav by cutting the ticket of its sitting MLA Randhir Singh on this seat
 haalanki raav indrajit apni beti ke liye tikat maang rahe the
 Former minister Captain Ajay Singh Yadav, who had won six consecutive terms from Rewari assembly constituency, lost the election in 2014 in the Modi wave
 aise main unhon is baar khud ke bajaay apane bete ko utaara he
 The BJP has bet on the Yadav candidates to surround them
 apane sapanom ko saath liye ek ladki dilli se saikadon mile dur mumbai pahunchati he
 This is where he has to fill his dreams
 lekin isse pehle ki ye mumkin hota, koi uske saare sapane badrang kar jaataa he
 Now a day passes heavily on her life and then one day she returns to her home, but imprisoned in the coffin
 1 may 2013, shaam ke 3 bajkar 40 minute, hazarat nizamuddin railway stesan, dillidilli ke hazarat nizamuddin railway stesan se ek train chali
 City of dreams for Mumbai
 or isi train main savaar hokar apane sapane sach karne nikali thi dilli kii 23 saal kii priti rathi
 She got a nurse job at the Army Hospital in Mumbai
 2 may 2013, subah 7 bajkar 55 minute, bandra terminal railway stesan, mumbaitay vakt par dilli-mumbai garib rath stesan par pahunch chuki thi
 Preity gets off the train and starts walking step by step with hundreds of passengers on the platform
 par thik tabhi achaanak ek gumnaam noujvaan aata he or priti par tezaab phenk detaa he
 CCTV cameras were installed at the station
 par ittefaq se us jagah camere kaa angel nahin pahunch rahaa tha jahaan par priti ke upar tejaab phenkaa gaya
 However, at the same time, one of the other angles of the camera, a boy is seen running fast
 ain vaardaat ke vakt is tarah usee jagah se is noujvaan ko bhaagate dekh police maan leti he ki isi ne priti par tejaab phenkaa he
 Therefore, a sketch is also prepared on the basis of CCTV footage
 laga chalo tejaab phenkane vaala ab batch nahin paaegaa
 But badly injured by acid, Preeti fights with breath in the hospital throughout the month
 har pal jiti-marati rahati he
 But his criminal is not caught
 or phir aakhirkaar ek june ko wo saanson kii jang haar jaati he
 On May 1, she left Delhi for Mumbai with a thousand dreams
 par ek june ko wo ankhen hi band ho gayi jinamein tamaam sapane the
 On May 1, Preity went to Delhi to Mumbai
 puure ek maheene baad do june ko priti phir safai par thi
 This time Mumbai to Delhi
 wo waapas laut rahi thi
 But being imprisoned in the coffin
 wo apane ghar se nikali to thi khwaabon ko puraa karne, lekin aadhe raste main hi kisi ne uske khwab chakanachur kar die
 The pain he endured for a whole month, before death, he also narrated his Hal-e-dil with the same vigor
 ab wo bol to nahin sakati thi, lekin apane haathon se likh kar wo kuch bataanaa chaahati thi
 After all, what did Preity want? And what did she expect from you? For the whole thirty days she kept fighting with her breath in the hospital
 puure tees din tak wo tejabi tis sahati rahi
 For the whole thirty days she kept stealing her eyes from her own face
 or phir tees din baad uski ruh ne us jism ko akhir chhod hi diya jo uskaa sabase bada dushman tha
 Whose wish could make someone alive
 wo haar gai
 But before losing, she narrated her every pain, every emotion, every happiness, every sorrow and every fear
 kore kaagaj par
 Now the question is, why should you read what he wrote? Why should you listen to what he said? While he also knew and you also know that he is not going to change by writing anything or listening to you
 par kya karen
 Now that she has gone to writing, you will have to read
 isliye chhodie in baton ko ki isse kya fark padegaa yaa kya kuch badalegaa
 Just read it for reading
 main apni mausi ke peeche-peeche chal rahi thi
 Then suddenly someone threw something
 mujhe pataa hi nahin chalaa
 Was he fair or black? mujhe bahut jalan ho rahi thi
 i was suffering
 agar mausi mere saath naa hoti to us din shaad main batch hi nahin paati
 By now everyone must have found out at home
 mummy or tension lengi
 i had prepared a lot for the job of INSS
 bahut mehnat kii thi
 i was very happy to get a lieutenant nurse job
 main ye job nahin chhodana chaahati
 But now my job may have gone
 yahaan mujhe doctor kuch bataa nahin rahe hai
 When will the surgery, when will this plaster be removed? ham or kitne din yahaan rahenge? kal shaam se haath kii movement main bhi pen he
 Was not before
 maine doctor sahab se poocha meri rhite ai kharaab he
 He told that i will not be able to see till there is a transplant
 or transplant jab tak main chehre se thik nahin ho paaungi, tab tak nahin hogi
 Papa, i want Nikki and Tannu to have complete security as well, i do not want what happened to me be with them
 mummy papa ne to mere liye rishte bhi dekhne shuru kar die the
 But i don't look beautiful anymore
 priti ne jab-jab likhaa to saath main ek sawaal bhi poocha
 The question is, who did this? What was his fault? Was his criminal arrested? But regrettably, Preeti could not find the answer to her questions
 kya priti par hamalaa kisi dushmani ke chalate hua yaa phir hamalavar ne dhokhe main priti ko apana shikaar bana daalaa? maamle kii tafteesh kar rahi railway pulisi ke paas priti ke gunahagaar kii ek tasviir bhi maujuud he or chashmadid ke bataae hulie ke mutabik sketch bhi
 But just because she is unable to find the answer to this same question, she is unable to reach Preeti's killer
 bandra terminal ke plateform number teen par record hue is sisitivi footage se priti ke gunahagaar ke pakade jane kii jo ummid jaagi thi, ek maheene guzarane ke baad ab wo ummid priti ke saanson kii door kii tarah tuutane lagi he
 In this footage, a person is seen running at the same speed, where acid was thrown on Preity a few seconds ago
 darasal, jis jagah par priti ke upar hamalaa hua, vahaan camera naa hone ke chalate us jagah kii koi bhi tasviir sisitivi main kaid nahin ho saki
 But the way the man was seen running away after the incident, the police started to think that this is a crime of love
 iske baad police ne hamalavar kaa ek sketch bhi taiyaar karavaaya, kyonki use lag rahaa tha ki ye vaardaat ranjish kaa nateeja ho sakati he or bahut mumkin he ki hamalavar uskaa peechha karte hue dilli se yahaan pahunchaa
 But contrary to the theory of enmity of the police, neither did Preity suspect anyone nor her family after this incident
 lihaaja, police ne priti mobile phone ke kol ditels uske gunahagaar ko talashne kii koshish kii
 But she also failed in this
 ab sawaal ye he ki kahin priti par hua hamalaa mistecan idantity yani pahchaan kii galati kaa to nahin he? or agar ye maamla dushmani kaa he, to phir police ke haath khaali kyon hai? baharhaal, in sawaalon kaa jiarapy ke paas chaahe jo bhi jawaab ho, is maamle kii jaanch ab sibiai se karaane kii maang uthne lagi he
 Preeti finally bid farewell to this world after battling for a month with acid wounds, but Delhi was once again angry before Preeti's departure
 gussa, samaaj se, police se, kanoon se
 And most of all that thinking, which makes a human being an animal
 ek baar phir phuta logon kaa gussa
 Demand for justice once again in the sky
 kabhi candal march kii surat main, to kabhi taabut ke saath log ek baar phir utre sadakon par
 This time there is anger among the people, against the baroness of Bandra, Mumbai, who made such an intense attack on Delhi's daughter Preeti on the morning of 2 May that she lost her life after a month
 vasantkunj gangrape or gudiya ke maamle main to khayr dilli police ne thode samay baad in ladakiyon ke gunahagaaron ko dhar dabocha tha, lekin priti ke maamle main to ab tak uske gunahagaar kii pahchaan tak nahin ho saki he or yahi logon ke gusse kii sabase badi vajah he
 When the news of Preity's death came out from Bombay Hospital in Mumbai, the anger of the people erupted
 mumbai main ek enjio kii aguwai main un mahilaon ne priti ke haq main insaaf kii aawaaj buland kii, jinhone khud kabhi tezaab kaa hamalaa jhela tha
 All these people were demanding that Preeti's attacker be nabbed at the earliest
 udhar, shaam hote-hote mumbai se dur dilli main saikadon logon ne narela main ek candal march nikaala or thane ke saamne ghanton apane gusse kaa izhaar karte rahe
 After this, when Preity arrived at her house for the last time, imprisoned in the coffin, all the people as well as her family also expressed their anger and regret
 gharavaalon ne priti ke antim sanskaar main sonia gandhi or dilli kii mukhyamantri shila dikshit ko bulaane, use rajkeey sammaan dene or maamle kii sibiai se jaanch karwaane kii maang rakh di or do took kaha ki jab tak ye baaten nahin maani jaati, tab tak wo priti kaa antim sanskaar nahin karenge
 He performed for a long time by blocking road in Narela along with Preeti's coffin
 haalanki baad main ilaake ke esadm ne jab unki maangon ko sarkaar tak pahunchane or police sammaan ke saath priti kaa antim sanskaar karwaane kii baat rakhi, to pradarshnkaree thode naram pad gaye
 Now Preeti may have merged into the Panch element, but the demand for the CBI to investigate the matter and punish her guilty is still there

 aap basketbaal ke achche khilaadi rahe hai
 Despite this, you wrote the story of a boxer for yourself? What i was trying to do, i could not find it
 phir likhnaa shuru kiya or mukkaabaz kii kahani likhi
 i was a little selfish about writing this film
 basketbaal team game he
 Had to write about it, we would have to write for the team
 isliye boxr ko lekar likhaa
 As an actor, you were not getting work of choice
 lekin mukkaabaz kii kahani pasand kii gai
 How was the experience? For three years i kept wandering with this story
 har kisi ne kahani maangi, magar mujhe isamen kaam nahin de rahe the
 i had worked in three films with Anurag ji
 isliye unase kahani par feedback maangi to unhone bataaya ki ve film banaaenge
 The condition is that i be a boxer
 iske baad to main boria-bistar baandhakar patiala chalaa gaya or vidhivat training lee
 My ribs were broken
 film main koi boxing koreographer nahin he
 i had to fight international boxers like Neeraj Goyat, Deepak Tanwar and Sandeep Yadav
 mukkaabaz ke baad kis tarahaki filmein karnaa chaahate hai?main to bhookha actor hum
 i want to do all kinds of films
 anubhav ne sikhaa diya he ki apane kirdaar main sab kuch laga do
 If the film goes well then it will be good

 If the next time the bank refuses to take your coins, then they will surely ask them in writing whether they have not received the RBI guidelines in this regard? On Tuesday, the central government said that complaints of not accepting coins by banks on behalf of common people Have been received
 vitt rajya mantri shiv pratap shukla ne rajyasabha main ek prashn ke likhit jawaab main kaha, ‘‘bhartiya rigerv bank(arabiai) ne bataaya he ki use aam logon se shikaayatein mili hai ki bank sikke sweekaar nahin kar rahe
 However, the minister said that no particular bank's name was written in these complaints
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki arabiai ne noton or sikkon kii adla-badali kii suvidha sambandhi apane ek paripatr dwaara bainkon ko salaah di he ki ve apni sabhi shakhaon main len-dein or adla-badali ke liye sikke sweekaar karen
 Shukla also said that the regional branches of the RBI have been instructed to open counters to accept coins from the common people and advise the controllers of the banks under their jurisdiction to accept the coins at all branches
 sikkon se sambandhit ek anya sawaal ke jawaab main vitt rajya mantri radhakrishnan ne kaha ki sikkon kii kanoonee vaidhata bhartiya sikaa nirmaan adhinium, 2011 kii dhara 6 ke antargat spasht kii gai he or bhartiya rigerv bank ne aam logon ko salaah di he ki apane sabhi lenden main 10 rupye ke sikke vaid mudra ke rup main behichak sweekaar karen
 The minister was replying to the question why even after a year has passed since Kinotbandi, why are public sector banks refusing to accept coins and what action has the government taken to clarify the legal validity of the coins
 main field main kabhi yah sawaal nahin karata ki aap kise vot denge
 i am not interested in this question
 main yah zarur dekhnaa chahta hum ki ek matadaata kis tarah kii soochnaaon or dharanaon se khud ko vot dene ke liye taiyaar karata he
 Baghpat met many young men of the district
 shahari naujavaanon kii tarah kisi ne kaha nahin yaa phir jataayaa nahin ki ve mujhe jaanate hai
 i wanted to go among young people who do not know me properly
 in naujavaanon kii kul sankhya 70-80 to aaraam se rahi hogi yaa usase bhi adhik ho sakati he
 All of them are youngsters preparing for government competition examinations
 jinke mudde main lagaataar dedh saal se uthaa rahaa hum
 There may be many reasons for not allowing my programs to reach 100% of these youth, but this was not my focus
 zaruri nahin ki har koi mujhe jane hi
 i want to share my experiences of talking to these youngsters
 naujavaanon ne apni taraf se 2014 kii tarah modi-modi nahin kiya
 In the 2014 elections, modi-modi used to start when someone kept a mic in front of him
 kuch bhi sawaal poochne par jawaab modi-modi aata tha
 This time it did not happen even once
 kya ye noujvaan modi ko vot nahin karenge? is lahar ke nahin hone ke baad bhi aisa nishchit taur par nahin laga
 Because those who supported the outspoken did not say themselves outright, this time they will teach lessons
 mere sawaal rojgaar or shiksha kii gunvattta tak hi simit the magar kai baar jawaab ke kram main jo niklaa usamen godi media kii kamyaabi nazar ai
 The dock media is the most successful undertaking of Modi's politics
 naujavaanon tak sirf bijepi kii baat pahunchi he
 bjp's allegations and arguments have arrived
 unki soochna kaa sansar unheen soochnaaon se bana he jise propeganda kahata hum
 In the remote areas, opposition and alternative information from the information world has been cleared from the mainstream to the private level
 naujavaanon kii jubaan par baatcheet kii charchaa ke dauraan vipaksh kaa zikr hameshaa bijepi ke tark se hi aayaa
 No one questioned BJP citing what the opposition has said about BJP
 raajnneetik charchaa ekapaksheeya ho chuki he
 The diversity in his naturalness has disappeared
 naujavaanon kii swaabhaavik charchaaon se vipaksh gaayab ho chukaa he
 The opposition is also to blame for this
 vipaksh ne sanchaar ke vaikalpik tareeke kaa istamaal nahin kiya
 The structure of their organizations was not used
 ve aaj bhi us akhbaar or channel ko dekhakar apana din shuru karte hai jahaan ve he hi nahin or honge bhi nahin
 i have seen many voters whose mind has created a situation of opposition
 ho saktaa he aisa na ho magar mujhe aisa laga
 i will meet further youngsters, i will write as the experience changes
 main mila to zarur kai darjan naujavaanon se magar baatcheet main hissaa kuch ne hi liya
 Why should the rest be silent, why were they not vocal on someone's behalf, it would not be right to gage, but i think it is important to record it
 ek noujvaan ne zarur chamak kar kaha ki sena par sawaal kiye ja rahe hai
 Congress should not
 par kya congress kaa sawaal sena ko lekar tha yaa maare gaye aatankiyon kii sankhya ko lekar tha jo bijepi ke netaaon ne apni taraf se kiye
 Such specifics are missing from discussion
 jo bhi he yah bolne vaala noujvaan apni seat se khadaa ho gaya
 Some youth sitting in their seats said that there should be no politics about the army
 modi kaa akele kaa faisla nahin tha
 There, everyone decides together
 isliye sabakaa faisla ho or uskaa shrey akelaa le yah thik nahin he
 After speaking all, they did not forget to say that there should not be politics about the army
 media yaa bijepi ke sanghathanon ne jo maahaul banaaya he shaayad usamen dabi jubaan itnaa hi kaha ja saktaa he
 It is obvious that these youth do not have enough confidence in their arguments to openly claim their views
 ladakiyon se bhi mila, unhen bolne ke liye protsaahit karne ke baad bhi nateeja zero rahaa
 It is very sad
 kaash ise koi badal detaa
 She could speak only one but she could not differentiate between her experience and political understanding
 jaisaa ki noujvaan ladke bhi nahin kar paae
 The girl said that if the government exam is held, then the seat is sold by paying money
 udhaaharan vah haal-philhal kaa de rahi thi magar ant main kaha ki jab se bhaajapa ai he, sab thik ho gaya he
 Is it necessary for the BJP to say something good after saying its point or is it their natural choice, i do not have the final answer
 main sirf us yuva ko pard rahaa tha jise lekar kaha jaataa he ki yah desh badal denge
 But he is well aware that poor understanding of English and mathematics has not left him to change the town
 main baagpat ke khekada tehsil ke ek koching centre main inase baaten kar rahaa tha
 The youth are aware that the education system in rural and town areas is at a standstill
 uski gunvattta itani karaab he ki ve kai saal skool or kalege main guzaarane ke baad bhi chaturth shrenee ke laayak hi ho pate hai
 These youth have seen poor government and school colleges
 ghatiya collejon kaa har daur main bane rahanaa or uskaa kabhi na badalanaa in naujavaanon ko shiksha main sudhaar kii kisi bhi ummid se dur kar diya he
 They have learned to ignore this information by accepting it
 aisi baat nahin he ki unhone ise thik karne ke liye prayaas nahin kiya
 But there was no result
 yah zarur he ki rojgaar ke sawaal se kaaphi pareshaan hai
 They understand that recruitments have come in the election year
 varanaa paanch saal tak vekency nahin ai
 Now when the elections are over, the recruitments will stop coming again
 lekin in sawaalon ko bayaan karte vakt unka vaisaa aakrosh nahin dikhaa jo berojgaare ke masale main ummid kii jaati he
 i am not interested in who they will vote for in the election
 bahut saare naujavaanon ne khulkar nahin kaha ki ve kise vot karenge
 But the BJP supporter said that the entire vote belongs to the BJP
 ham ummidavaar ko vot nahin kar rahe hai
 He is unhappy with them
 unhone aisi kai kamiyaan gina di jinhen sunakar lag saktaa he ki ye bijepi ko vot nahin karenge
 They all told that there is no doctor in the hospital
 apaat sthiti main 30 kimi dur janaa padataa he
 Studies are poor sadaken karaab hai
 Cleanliness is in a bad state
 magar hamaara sara vot bhaajapa ko jayega
 This young man can be an active supporter, even if it is, i was trying to see how all kinds of crises affect a voter
 unke man kii baat nahin jaanata lekin jo kaha uske aadhaar par laga ki koi asar nahin padataa he
 One said that the country is important
 uske liye do saal or berojgaar rah lenge
 It was the same young man who was saying that when everyone together decided to attack Pakistan, then why is Modi taking credit alone
 sirf ek jagah kuch matadaataaon main khud ko lekar spashtataa dikhi
 These were the people who hoped to get compensation for their land until the BJP voted in the election of panchayat, councilor, MLA and MP
 inkaa kahana he ki bijepi ke logon ne hi pradarshan shuru karavaaya, shuru main unke netaa khub aae
 His performance has been over two years now
 zamin par reng kar pradarshan karne se lekar police kii lathi khaane or kai mukademon main ghere jane ke baad ab ve kisi or vikalp kii soch rahe hai
 Without asking, we will not vote
 lakhanu se lekar dilli tak sarkaar hone ke baad bhi muawza nahin dilaayaa or na hi jeetne ke baad haal lene aae
 Women are also hurt by the police
 ek voter se naagarik banane kii prakriya kitni lambii he
 Many years later he changes
 badalane kaa matlab he ki vah system kii krurta dekh paata he
 Can it be claimed on the basis of their experiences that there has been a citizen consciousness among the farmers? Are they so honest about their issues that loyalty to any political party does not matter? My answer is no
 raajnneetik dalon ne baar baar kisaanon ko thaga he
 Now they are not able to distinguish between being cheated and crushed
 raajnneetik badlaav ek party ko haraakar duusari ko laane se nahin aata he
 Political change comes in the creation of political consciousness
 kya vipaksh ne kisi raajnneetik chetana kaa nirmaan kiya he, uske liye sangharsh kiya he? yaa phir logon ne apane str par raajnneetik chetana kaa nirmaan kiya he, jisamen media or vipakshi sanghathanon kii koi bhoomika nahin he, to iskaa jawaab 26 may ko milegaa
 Not now because the public is not speaking
 bataa nahin rahi he
 If we look at the process of voter formation, then everything is left to the personal experiences of the voter
 nijee anubhavon ke sahare inhen chhod kar soochna sansar ne inhen akelaa chhod diya he
 The information world creates such experiences for them, which often overwhelms their personal experience
 mujhe ek matadaata kaa laaparvaah dikhnaa yaa vot ko lekar halke main baat karnaa acha nahin lagata
 Its light is the hollow of democracy
 sheersh america dootbrett macgark ne kaha he ki iraqi shahar mosul se aies kaa khaatmaa bhale hi ho gaya ho, lekin is aatanki sanghathan ke khilaaf ladaai abhi jari rahegi
 Brett mcgurk, the top US envoy to the International Coalition Against the Islamic State (IS), said, "the work is not done yet
" hamen abhi aage badhanaa he
 So, we have a meeting today so that we can coordinate our efforts for the next phase
 ’ unhone mosul ko aaazaad karaane ko aies ke khilaaf badi safalataa bataaya
 He said the one-year campaign in Mosul ended in the last few days
 unhone mosul abhiyaan ko dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke baad sabase mushkil sainya abhiyaan qaraar diya
 The comments unhone kaha ki rakka or syria iraq ke bajaae kahin zyada jatil he
 However the model there is largely the same
 macgark ne kaha ki raajnneetik sulah par kaaphi kuch nirbhar karata he
 The arrival of 40,000 foreign fighters in Syria in about four years was the main reason for the rise of IS
 isi tarah iraq main bhi aisa hi hua
 a large number of terrorist, suicide bombers also came here
 unhone kaha, ‘agar kisi bhi desh main vishwa bhar se is prakaar ke log khud ko masjidon, icecream parloron main udaane aaenge, bacchon kii hatya karne aaenge, to jo hoga, vahiin iraq main ho rahaa tha
 'he said that as long as such people continue to come from all over the world, there cannot be political progress
 macgark ke anusaar videshi ladaake ab syria main nahin aa rahe
 (apart from the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it has been published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) He said that Raqqa and Syria are far more complex than Iraq
 haalanki vahaan kaa model kaaphi had tak samaan he
 mcgurk said much depends on political reconciliation
 syria main kareeb chaar saal main 40,000 videshi ladaakon kaa aana aies ke udai kaa mukhya kaaran tha
 The same thing happened in Iraq
 yahaan bhi badi sankhya main aatankwaadi, aatmghaatee hamalavar aae
 He said, 'if in any country such people from all over the world will come to blow themselves up in mosques, ice cream parlors, kill children, then whatever will happen was happening in Iraq
 ’ unhone kaha ki jab tak vishvabhar se is prakaar ke logon kaa aana jari rahegaa, tab tak raajnneetik pragati nahin ho sakati
 According to mcgurk, foreign fighters are no longer coming to Syria
 (hedline ke alaava, is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he, yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he

 Prior to the Lok Sabha elections, UPA Chairperson Sonia Gandhi's daughter Priyanka Gandhi has come into action with an entry in politics
 guuruuvaar ko priyanka gandhi congress mahasachiv pad kaa kaarybhaar sanbhaalane ja rahi hai
 But before that, posters of Priyanka Gandhi have been placed outside the Congress office in the national capital Delhi and in Lutyens zone area
 in poster main priyanka ke saath rahul gandhi or pati robert wadra bhi najar aa rahe hai
 Slogans are also written in the poster in a new way, in which it is tried to tell that the Congress believes not on fanatical thinking but on youthful vigor
 haalanki, ab congress netaa jagadish sharma kaa aarope he ki in postaron ko NDMC ke dwaara hatwaya ja rahaa he
 He said that through hard work throughout the night, he put up these posters, but under pressure from the Bharatiya Janata Party, NDMC has removed these posters
 gauratlab he ki aaj hi robert wadra kaa idi ke saamne pesh hona he

 On this occasion, the film's lead actor Rishi Kapoor, Taapsee Pannu and director Anubhav Sinha answered many questions
 rishi kapur ne kaha ki is film ke jariye sarthak massej dene kii koshish kii gai
 He said that an issue has been raised in the film which is not today, but has been going on since independence
 rishi ne kaha aap kis majahab ke hai isse pehle ye myne rakhata he ki aap ek hindustani hai
 Not resolving the Kashmir issue is the benefit of political parties? Rishi further expressed his sorrow over this saying, "many countries have resolved their issues
 ek ham he jo pichley 71 saal se kashmir ke mudde par atake hue hai
 The sage raised the question and said when will the solution finally come out
 " aage unhone kaha, "maine dekha rus-china main communism hat gaya, south africa main kaala-safed kaa bhed khatm ho gaya
 The East and West walls were demolished in Berlin, but why has there been no solution to the Kashmir issue between indo-pak so far? "the sage said on the attitude of governments on this issue - 'somebody even told me that Perhaps our political parties do not want to end this issue for political gain
 'mulk Trailer: 'har musalmaan tebrist nahin', kya sabit kar paaenge rishimujhe hanuman chalisa rati hui he aap mujhe anti hindu nahin bol sakatebta den mulk film banane ko lekar pichley dinon diarector anubhav sinha par trobers ne jaise dhaava bol diya
 He was charged with the involvement of political parties in the film
 yahi nahin unhen anti-hindu tak bolaa gaya
 Talking about this, Anubhav said, 'I was born in Benaras
 har roj mujhe meri maa mandir lekar jaati thim
 i therefore remembered Hanuman Chalisa as well
 mandir aate jate maine hanuman chalisa rat lee or aaj bhi main bolta hum to koi mujhe kaise anti-hindu bol saktaa he
 'anubha Sinha clearly stated that her film is a social drama in which social issues have been raised and not a political drama
 'daaud, rahul gandhi or mohan bhagwat se puch lo, 'mulk' main nahin laga unka paisa'jaankaree ke liye bataa den is film main lead actress ke role main taapasi pannu ko musalmaan bane rishi ke kirdaar kii vakaalat karne ko lekar trol kiya ja rahaa he
 On this attitude of the trollers, the actress said that she really does not mind such trolls
 kyonki aae din actors kai baton ko lekar trol hote hai
 If they make a difference, then only those people who have a good thinking, their outlook on hindu-muslim issues is also correct, but why don't they raise the voice? The film is going to be released on August 3 this year
 film relies se pehle hi vivaadon main he, relies ke baad kaa alam kya hoga ye dekhne laayak hoga

 ' bhartiya rigerv bank ke governor raghuram rajan ne 2 june ko byaaj daron main chauthai fisadi kii or katautee to kar di, lekin arthvyavastha ke samaksh maujuud kuch khataron ko bhi rekhaankit kiya, khaskar jo kamjor monsoon kii ashanka se upaj rahe hai
 His statement had an adverse impact on the market and the stock market index fell more than 1,000 points within two days
 rajan ne india today samooh ke editor (bijness televijan) vivek lau se khulkar baat kii ki byaaj daron main or katautee kaa darwaja abhi kyon “band nahin he
 "he hoped that this time the government is in a better position to deal with the results of weak monsoon
" unhone yah bhi bataaya ki aarthik samasyaon ko durust karne ke liye kya karnaa hoga
 Excerpts from the conversation: You recently discussed unrealistic expectations from the government and used a "ronald Reagan sitting on a white horse" for it
 kya aapke or bhartiya rigerv bank ke maamle main bhi yahi lagu hota he?dekhie, ummiden to apni jagah hai
 i have consistently emphasized that our job is to create an atmosphere of trust in terms of rupee value, inflation and macroeconomic stability, but we have no role on the economic growth front
 ham kuchhek dhanchaagat sudhaaron main madad jarur kar sakate hai, isiilie hamane elaan kiya tha ki ham agast ke ant tak chote vittiya bainkon ko license dene main samarth ho jaaenge, lekin is morche par aguai to aakhirkaar nijee kshetra, sarkari kshetra, yaa khud sarkaar ko kerani he kyonki nivesh kaa kaam unheen kaa he, jisase vruddhi dar badhati he
 Our job is to create an atmosphere and we create a better environment at our level even amidst all the complications
 haalanki har koi apane nazariye se dekhtaa he
 Industrialists view this as a cost point of view
 ve yah bhul jate hai ki ek doosraa varg bachatakartaaon kaa he jo is baat kii chintaa karata he ki use apni jamaa par mudrasphiti dar se zyada laabh mil sake
 We have to strike a balance between the two
 log yah nahin samajhate ki sara daaromadar santulan kaa hi he
 Has the Reserve Bank played its role in creating a wider environment? Should the rest of the environment be ready by now? What do you expect the government or the private sector to do? There are some problems of the past that we have inherited
 unase ham jaise-jaise nibatate jaaenge, aarthik vruddhi tej hoti jaaegi
 i think this process is going on but more work has to be done
 hamaara kaam khatm nahin hua he
 We have to make way for some projects which are stuck
 is maamle main jimmedaari sarkaar, nijee kshetra or banking kshetra kii he
 Are you disappointed about the growth rate despite these measures? i think a lot of work is going on
 hamen ek khaas tantra ke bheetar kaam karnaa he
 This system is good
 acchhee baat yah he ki hamaara loktantr gatisheel he or isamen santulan or niyantran kii pranaliyaan maujuud hai
 Within this system, we have to move forward and it has a fixed speed
 duusari ahm cheez yah he ki ham jaise-jaise ek viksit arthvyavastha banate jaaenge, hamen sansthaanon kaa bhi nirmaan karne kii jarurat hogi
 It takes time and real expectations are needed
 ham manmarjee se nitiyaan nahin bana sakate jaisaa ateet main hota aayaa he
 For example, when you move towards controlling inflation, you move on the basis of your forecast, but there is a constant debate that you should skip your forecasts and focus on economic growth because its rate is weak
 lekin hamaara kaam mudrasphiti ko bhi kaabo main rakhana he
 Therefore, we are also trying to give maximum attention in this direction
 bazaar daron main katautee chahta tha, aapane vahi kiya
 The forecast does not look reliable
 kya ab is saal daron main or katautee nahin kii jaaegi?mujhe lagata he ki yah galat samaj he
 We had said that by relying on our forecast, we will achieve our inflation target by the end of this year
 is raste main kai rode hai
 We pointed to three
 ek to monsoon he, lekin usase kahin zyada ahm kamjor monsoon par prashasnic pratikriya he
 Monsoon is weak but if you have appropriate policy measures, it can make a big difference
 hamane kuch tarki k anumaanon ko shaamil kiya he lekin pratikriya bahut shashakt rahi or monsoon bhi purvanumaan ke mukaable majboot rahaa, to hamaare kaam karne ke liye zyada nitigat gunjaaish ban sakegi
 Similarly, oil prices are a big factor
 idhar bich ve teji se badi hai
 We believe that it has a maximum level of value
 ek dharna yah he ki bazaar main isaki aapurti jarurat se zyada he
 Earlier too, the price fell due to this
 aisa phir hota he to hamen phir zyada gunjaaish mil sakegi
 The same applies with the outdoor environment
 matlab aap kah rahe hai ki darwaja abhi band nahin hua he?darwaja abhi band nahin hua he
 What is your opinion on oil? How serious is the risk of price rise? The basic fact of the oil market is that the production of shale has increased considerably, investments in shale can be made in a short time
 tel kii keemat 70 dollar prati bairal se zyada hui to shell anveshan ke ve kshetra jo band kar die gaye the, unhen teji se kholaa ja saktaa he
 i am getting the same trends from market players
 iskaa matlab hua ki 70 dollar prati bairal isaki adhiktam keemat he or hamane apane anumaanon main bhi isi ko sangyaan main liya he
 There is currently no flow
 agar pravaah zyada rahaa or vaishvik arthvyavastha kamjor bani rahi, to iskaa asar tel kii keemton par pad saktaa he
 a decline can also be seen in it
 jo cheez ham nahin jaanate, vah he bhu-rajnatik khatre
 Do not know what is going to happen in Iraq or Libya due to ISIS
 aapane byaaj daren to gata deen lekin asal sawaal yah he ki upabhoktaaon tak iskaa laabh pahunchataa he yaa nahin
 Has anything changed on that front? It is slowly gaining
 ham byaaj daron main giravat dekh rahe hai
 Banks are doing the same
 bazaar main samay ke saath pratispardhaa badhegi to iskaa laabh bhi miltaa dikhegaa
 We are actually trying to find out if our policies are doing so in any way impeding the ability of a bank, including the base rates policy
 mujhe ummid he ki ham samay ke saath zyada bazaar aadhaarit paimaane kii ore bad saken
 Let us first move towards the marginal cost price, then towards the market benchmark rate and finally get out of the business that banks have to tell to fix their rates
 bainkon ko pratispardhaa ke aadhaar par daren tay karne dena chahie
 This is a big improvement
 iske liye aapaki yojana kya he?mujhe lagata he ki janvari ke ant tak ham aisa kar paaenge
 By the end of this financial year, we will be able to bring all banks to marginal cost price
 abhi ham unase is bare main baat kar rahe hai or unki jaruratein jaanane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 When the benchmark is fixed, when the benchmark company is formed, then we will be able to ask them to come up to the benchmark
 vishwa arthvyavastha main bharat kii vaastavik haisiyat dilaane ke liye aapkaa najariya kya he?alpavadhi main ham vahi kar rahe hai jo hamen karnaa chahieh viraasat main mili samasyaon ko durust kar rahe hai jo aarthik vruddhi kii tej dar kii raah main aade aa rahi thim
 These problems are arising out of development itself
 aap bhoomi adhigrahan par chal rahi puri bahes ko hi dekhie
 Land is to be acquired in remote areas where the majority of the population is tribal and does not have the ability to protect their rights, that is why we are doing so much back and forth on this issue
 kabhi ham unhen vanadhikaar de rahe hai, kabhi adivaasiyon ke adhikaar de rahe hai or phir hamen yah pataa chal rahaa he ki in adhikaron kaa sammaan karte hue vahaan hamen khadaanen bhi kholani hai
 The question is, how to do this work properly? It is like churning in a democratic society
 ham in samasyaon se nibatane kii koshish main jute hue hai
 How will India's industrialization happen? For employment generation, what do we need to do to fix the production sector? Our biggest strength is that we have all kinds of entrepreneurs & young, elderly, tech-prone and tech-less, etc
 hamen inke liye ek sakaaratmak maahaul bananaa hoga, jiskaa matlab he infrastracchar, yani hamen maanviya puunji kii gunvattta main sanvardhan karne kii jarurat hogi
 Today everyone is in school but they need to learn more
 ek badhiya kaarkaane main naukari ke liye hyskool str ke shikshan se unhen paryaapt aage aana hoga
 That is to increase their ability to get employment
 hamen kaarobaar ko niyamit karne par kaam karne kii jarurat he
 We have to get rid of all the wrong rules, while creating such appropriate structures where our regulation is still very bad today
 masalan, niyamon ke rahete hue yah kaise sambhav ho saktaa he ki aaj bhi ganga main siver kaa pani bahata he? hamen zyada satark or sakht niyamon ko lagu karnaa hoga
 The last dimension is that of finance
 ham is baat par jor de rahe hai ki samooche desh main vitt kaise zyada uplabdh karavaaya jaae taaki har kshetra iskaa istemaal karke tarakkee kar sake
 Apart from this, a more active banking system is also needed so that the problems of inheritance in this sector can be overcome, the governance of public sector banks can be rectified
 yahi mudde hamen jakade hue hai
 The question is how to correct those in crisis
 jaisaa ki ek purv mantri ne kaha tha ki hamaare udhyami biimaar na hon, bhale companiyaan biimaar hon
 We need to deal with such issues
 pradhanmantri kehete hai ki aap achche shikshak hai
 What would you like to suggest to the government to overcome the problems
 mere khyaal se sarkaar jaanati he ki samasyaayein kya hai or vah us par kaam bhi kar rahi he
 i think stalled projects are important
 aisa pehali baar he ki ham dher sari bijli paidaa kar rahe hai lekin vah upabhoktaaon tak nahin pahunch paa rahi kyonki bijli vitarak companiyaan uski laagat nahin chukaa saktin
 That is why some distributor companies have been restructured
 hamen dekhnaa hoga ki yah jarurat ke hisaab se kargar rahaa he yaa nahin
 What we do about those who have not been restructured, will also have to be seen
 bainkon kii balance shit ko durust karnaa bhi jaruri he taaki jaise hi karj kii maang bade, bank vruddhi kii raah main khud suvidha mahasoos kar saken
 How do you see the global situation - for example, Greece, the US Federal Reserve raising interest rates? No one knows about Greece
 iske bare main baat karnaa mushkil he
 i think sympathy can be taken from both sides in this matter
 main ummid hi karuunga ki isaki disha aisi na hone paae jo europea vittiya tantra ko nuksaan pahunchane vaali sabit ho
 i don't think anyone will be in a position to say anything about whether they will be able to come to an agreement or not
 jahaan tak america kii baat he, uski pehali timahi kharaab rahi he or phir maudrik kadai ko taalane kii baaten hai
 Do you feel the danger of going out of capital from India? The answer is yes and no
 ham jab equity main videshi sansthagat niveshkon (exiai) kii puunji ko dekhte hai to pate hai ki date main pravaah ke mukaable yah kahin zyada sthir rahi he
 i believe that unless some fundamental changes happen, people will take appropriate decisions after the initial shock of instability
 isiilie mujhe isaki bahut chintaa nahin he ki america main liya gaya faisla hamaare bazaaron ko gira degaa
 Our market reaction will be the same as any other market but i do not think investors will stay away from it after the initial tremors
 hamaari buniyaad majboot rahi to ve lautenge
 That is why i say strengthen your foundation for sustainable growth
 ek vittiya bhavishyavaktaa se arabiai ke governor tak kaa aapkaa safar kaisaa rahaa he? aisa lagata he ki skool ke dinon main aap pradhanmantri banane kaa lakshya rakhte the?mere kehane kaa matlab yah tha ki mere khyaal se skool ke baad mere lakshya kahin zyada vyaavhaarik hue hai
 i think there is considerable satisfaction in this type of work
 ek professor yaa phir antarrashtriya mudra kosh ke mukhya arthshaastri ke bataur bhi aap buniyadi rup se sirf paramarshdaata hote hai or log aapaki kahi baat kii upeksha kar sakate hai or hota bhi aisa hi he
 But here are some reasons why people do as you call them
 kendriya bainkon ne hameshaa yah galati kii he ki ve jitna kar sakate hai, usase zyada kaa vaada kar daalaa he
 The only thing a central bank can do is create a structure, not create growth on its own
 vruddhi kahin or se aani he
 This is what we are trying to tell people
 loksabhaa chunaav ke najadik aane ke saath hi siyaasi vaadon or ailaanon kaa daur bhi shuru ho chukaa he

 After the Goods and Services Tax (GST) is implemented across the country, there is a possibility of increase in tax of service sector
 rajasav sachiv hasmukh adhiya ne yah jaankaree dete hue bataaya ki abhi liya ja rahaa 15% kaa sarvice tex badhkar 18% ho jayega
 This will make various services, including telephone and restaurant bills, expensive
 abhi sarvice sector main 14% tex ke saath 0
 5-0
 5% svachh bharat ses or krishi kalyaan ses lagaaya jaataa he
 In this way the service sector has to pay 15% tax
 is par adhiya ne kaha, 'haa, sarvice sector ke liye tex kii maanak dar 18% tak bad sakati he
 However, Adhia made it clear that the sectors currently exempted from it may continue, including health services, education and agriculture
 unhone kaha, 'vartmaan main jin kshetron ko chhot mili he, ham unhen jari rakhane kii koshish karenge
 We have recommended it to the council, which will decide on it
 sambhaavna he ki ve ise sweekaar karenge
 Adhia clarified that those whose annual income is less than Rs 20 lakh, they will not come under GST and will not have to pay any service tax
 vartmaan main 10 lakh rupee se adhik kii aay par sarvice tex chukaana hota he
 Under the GST law, farmers, who cultivate with themselves and family members and have a turnover of more than Rs 20 lakh, will not be kept under GST
 vartmaan main resham utpaadan, phulon kii kheti, dugdh utpaadan, bagwani or machhlee paalan main badi sankhya main bahari shramikon kii sevaayen lee jaati hai
 At present, he is exempted from service tax
 kya jiesti main bhi unhen yah chhot di jaae yaa nahin, is par abhi vichaar kiya ja rahaa he
 Adhia said, 'we have not decided on the exemption list yet
 is par parishad alag se vichaar karegi
 i do not think that currently any area related to agriculture will be taxed
 ' unhone yah bhi kaha ki jin sevaaon par philhal 15% se kamsarvice texlgaya ja rahaa he, use jari rakhane kii koshish kii jaaegi
 The Revenue Secretary also said that since petrol and petroleum products are kept under GST at zero fee, a 5% tax can be levied on transportation
 jiesti parishad ne tex ke chaar slab tay kiye hai, 5%, 12%, 18% or 28%
 In addition there is a 0% slab

 Less than a week is left for the ICC Cricket World Cup debut
 aise main har team apane plaing ilevan ko antim rup dene kii koshish main juty he
 Mahendra Singh Dhoni, the captain of the Indian cricket team, was engaged in this exercise from the tri-series against England and Australia
 par pareshaani yah he ki dhoni jin sawaalon ke saath match main utarate hai, unke jawaab milanaa to dur team ke saamne kuch or sawaal uth khadey hote hai
 WC: What should be the batting line-up of Team indiateam India lost in practice matches as well? What is the bowling order? How many all-rounders should be given a place in the team? Get off with four regular bowlers or three? Who will bowl in slog overs? There are many such questions, whose answers are yet to be found
 maxwell ne 15 gendon main banaae 55 ranhaal ye he ki team india kaa pradarshan match dar match or kharaab hota ja rahaa he
 India suffered a 106-run defeat in a practice match on Sunday
 australia ke khilaaf team india ne pehle gendbaaji karte hue 372 ran lutaae or jawaab main sirf 45
 He was dismissed for 265 runs in 1 over
 ab prashansakon ke man main ye sawaal uthne lage hai ki kya yah team apane khitaab kaa sammanjanak tareeke se bachaav bhi kar paaegi yaa nahin
 Many cricket experts are not seeing the current team going past the quarter-finals
 lekin ye sab to baad kii baat he
 At the moment, let's look at the questions Dhoni is looking for
 1
 Which bowlers to choose? Team India has been in Australia for more than 45 days but looking at the bowlers does not look like that at all
 ek gendbaaj nahin he jisapar bharosa kiya jaae ki vah wicket dilaa paaegaa
 Mohammad Shami, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Umesh Yadav, r Ashwin and Mohit Sharma show sparks for a few moments but are completely shattered as soon as they come under pressure
 alam yah he ki agar bharat pehle batting karata he to gendbaaj kisi bhi score kaa bachaav nahin kar pate or pehle gendbaaji karne kii sthiti main to virodhiyon kaa 300 se zyada ran bananaa tay dikhataa he
 Dhoni's problem has increased with the injury of Ishant Sharma
 bhubaneshwar kumaar puri tarah se feet nahin hai, saath hi unki gendbaaji main wo dhar nahin dikh rahi jisaki ummid team management ko hogi
 Mohammed Shami has disappointed the most, the effect of poor performance of the Test series is now showing his ODI performance as well
 pich se zyada madad nahin milane ke kaaran aswin kii phiraki main wo painaapan najar nahin aata
 Ravindra Jadeja and Akshar Patel also have a similar situation
 donon na wicket le pate hai or na hi ran rukta he
 In some matches, Binny started bowling with a new ball, he has got some wickets but lack of pace goes in favor of the opposition batsmen
 2
 Concerns about batting Team India's performance is now completely dependent on batting
 par jis tarah se kuch maichon main team niyamit 50 over khilne main bhi naakaam rahi he, isane dhoni kii tension or badha di he
 Shikhar Dhawan last scored a half-century in the Gaba Test
 iske baad ve har match main saste main out hue
 Rohit Sharma is in form, but fitness is under question
 test siries main jabardast pradarshan karne ke baad viraat kohli kaa balla vanade main ab tak khamosh rahaa he
 Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Suresh Raina, who are considered the life of lower middle order batting, are completely out of form
 3
 What will be the bowling combination? Which bowlers will Dhoni trust
 yah behad hi ahm sawaal he
 As of now, Umesh Yadav, Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Mohit Sharma are expected to be included in the playing eleven as fast bowlers
 vahiin spin kii jimmedaari aar aswin ke kandhon par hogi or olerounder ke taur par stuart binni kaa khelnaa tay dikh rahaa he
 The problem with this combination is that batting in the lower order tends to be a bit weak
 kuch jaankaron kaa kahana he ki team india kii majbootee spin gendbaaji he aise main har match main do spinner ko plaing ilevan main shaamil karnaa chahie
 Especially Ravindra Jadeja be a part of playing XI, he can also contribute in batting and fielding
 4
 Confusion Shakhar Dhawan's poor form over opening and middle order
 rohit sharma kii fitness
 Lack of consistency in Rahane's performance
 opening ballebaaji team india ke gale kii fans ban gai he
 It has been difficult for Dhoni to decide whom to trust
 vaise abhyaas match main dhawan or rohit sharma se opening karwaakar dhoni ne is paheli ko kuch had tak sulajhane lene kii ore ishaara kiya he
 Where to bat Kohli, third or fourth
 ise lekar sanshay barkaraar he
 Sometimes Ambati Rayudu and sometimes Ajinkya Rahane, team management is experimenting again and again, but nothing concrete has come out so far
 dhoni baar-baar ye shikaayat kar rahe hai ki team kii ballebaaji main gaharaai kii kami he
 In such a situation, he will risk taking the field with 7 batsmen and four bowlers
 bharat jab aaazaad hua tab tak hindi cinema kaaphi tarakkee kar chukaa tha

 Why this change? Assembly elections are to be held in UP and Assam

 There is also pressure on the Amit Shah and PM Modi pair after the bjp's defeat in the Bihar Assembly elections

 Elections are to be held in West Bengal as well, so changing the image of the central government is the first priority of the Sangh

 hamen lagata he ki bharat kii bahudaleey vyavastha main sabhi raajnneetik dalon kaa samarthan hota he or is vyavastha main ham in sambandhon ke jari rahane kii ummid kar sakate hai
 According to another US official, there is not much concern about Modi in his country's government, but it is believed that the administration has decided to maintain status quo in this matter, as it has to interfere in the internal politics of India
 Can be seen on sutron ke anusaar, yathasthiti main kisi tarah kaa badlaav hone par raajnneetik dal chunaav se pehle is mudde kaa raajnneetikaran kar sakate hai
 He said that the US is ready to work with any leader who becomes the Prime Minister of India after the general elections next year

 The paving way for the remains of 39 Indians killed at the hands of Baghdadi militants in Mosul, Iraq, four years ago, has been cleared for the first week of April
 videsh rajya mantri general wike singh jaruri manjuuri milane ke baad ek april ko baghdad ja rahe hai
 The remains of all 39 Indians are currently kept in the Forensic Department of Baghdad
 khabaron ke mutabik iraqi sarkaar ke saath jaruri kanoonee prakriyaayein puri karne ke baad agle hafte ek vishesh vimaan se sabhi 39 bharatiyon ke avshesh bharat laae jaaenge
 2014: Thousands of Indians present in Mosul, Iraq's northern city of Mosul was still quiet
 bagdadi or ieses kii napak najar abhi tak is shahar par nahin padi thi
 However, ISIS was gradually gaining control over the rest of Iraq
 magar kisi ko ummid nahin thi ki bagdadi mosul main bhi daakhil ho saktaa he
 Because of the oil well, the security system here was very tight
 shahar shant tha lihaaza tab mosul main bade paimaane par construction kaa kaam bhi chal rahaa tha
 At that time, in 2014, about ten thousand Indians were living in Iraq
 inamen se ek badi taadaad mazdooron kii thi
 Many of these workers were working in a private construction company in Mosul
 june 2014: ISIS kiya tha mosul par kabjauttari iraq ke kai chote-mote shaharon se hote hue achaanakaiesake aatankwaadi june ke pehle hafte main mosul par dhaava bol dete hai
 Actually, Baghdadi needed money to continue its fight
 or mosul par kabja kar wo tel ke bhandar par kabja karnaa chahta tha
 That is why he had given his full strength to occupy Mosul
 or aakhirkaar kuch din kii ladaai ke baad hi puure mosul par bagdadi kaa kabja ho jaataa he
 Most of the foreign laborers and workers working there escaped their lives as soon as IS attacked in 40 Indian mosques in the construction company's quarters
 magar bahut se vahiin fanse rah jate hai
 Most of them were laborers from India and Bangladesh
 june 2014 ke tisare hafte main aies ke aatankwaadi mosul ke kareeb badoosh ilaake main ek rose us jagah ja pahunchate hai, jahaan construction company ke quarter main 40 bhartiya majdoor rah rahe the
 About 55 Bangladeshi laborers were also present with them
 bangladeshi mazdooron ke saath batch niklaa tha harjitconstruction company kaa maalik iraqi tha
 He later told that the people of Baghdadi tied all the laborers with them and took them away from there on some unknown
 iske baad use unke bare main kabhi koi jaankaree nahin mili
 But according to Iraqi officials, after being taken hostage, all those people were taken to the same area of badakh
 phir kuch dinon baad unamem se 55 bangladeshi mazdooron ko alag kar unhen reeha kar diya gaya
 Harjit Christ, one of the 40 Indian laborers held hostage, was also released along with those Bangladeshi laborers
 darasal, usne aies ke aatankwaadiyon ko apana asli naam nahin bataaya tha
 Therefore, considering him as Bangladeshi, the terrorists set him free
 messiah ke daawey par sarkaar ko nahin tha yakinaies ke haathon agava hone ke baad june 2014 main hi kisi tarah ek majdoor ne punjab apane ghar phone kar bagdadi ke haathon bandhak banaae jane kii khabar di thi
 After that, he never received his call nor did any news of the remaining 39 Indian laborers come after this
 haalanki rihaai ke baad harjit messiah ne videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj se sampark kar ye daawa kiya ki uske saath bandhak banaae gaye 39 bhartiya mazdooron ko uski ankhon ke saamne bagdadi ke logon ne goliyon se bhun daalaa tha
 But the Government of India said that Christ was lying some things, so his claim was not believed
 badoosh kii pahari par hua tha katleamkhaiyr, vakt bitta gaya auralapata bhartiyamazdooron kii koi khabar nahin mili
 Even the Minister of State for External Affairs General VK Singh visited Iraq three times
 udhar, saal 2017 kaa khaatmaa hote-hote mosul bagdadi ke haathon se nikal kar ek baar phir azaad ho chukaa tha
 The Iraqi forces now occupied Mosul
 laapata bharatiyon kii talash ab mosul ke andar tak pahunch chuki thim
 Meanwhile, the local residents of Badush, who have recovered from the fear of Baghdadi one day, said that on a hill near Baghdadi, the terrorists of Baghdadi had lined up and shot many people and buried them all on the same hill
 
 aise khulaa bharatiyon kii maut kaa rajtin saal kii hukumat ke dauraan mosul ko bagdadi puri tarah se barbaad kar chukaa tha
 Thousands of people were killed
 jagah-jagah samuhik kabristaan mil rahe the
 In which hundreds of dead bodies were buried
 ab un sabake bich se 39 bharatiyon kii laashen dhundhna wo bhi teen saal baad behad mushkil kaam tha
 But with the efforts and technology of the Iraqi government, it was found that there are many Lashes buried on the mountain of Badush
 jab khudaai kii gai to vahaan se 39 laashen baraamad hui, jo ab puri tarah kankal ban chuki thi
 Some long hair and hard hands were also found from there
 jisase bharat sarkaar kaa shaq pukhta ho gaya
 Because the missing Indians were also 39 and the skeletons found there too
 diene jaanch kii prakriya shuru hui or teen maah ke bheetar ek baad ek sabhi diene laapata bharatiyon ke diene se match ho gaye
 It was revealed in such a way that all of them had been slaughtered three years earlier
 ab bas unke kankal bharat laae ja rahe hai

" —saath menkumar anshuman No matter the age, most people are troubled by the problem of white hair
 pehle jahaan ek tay umr ke baad hi logon ke bal safed hote the, vahiin ab bacchon ke bal bhi safed hone lage hai
 Genetics is often understood to cause hair whitening at an early age
 lekin baalo ke safed hone ke peeche kai duusare kaaran bhi ho sakate hai
 Let us tell why the hair of people becomes white at an early age
 pradooshan-vaayu pradooshan se bhi baalo ko kaaphi nuksaan pahunchataa he
 The polluted elements present in the air damage the hair and cause them to whiten rapidly
 export ke mutabik, pradooshit hawa main maujuud free radicals melanin ko damege kar ke baalo ko safed karne kaa kaam karte hai
 2
 tanaav-umr se pehle baalo ke safed hone kaa ek kaaran tanaav bhi he
 Hair quickly loses its natural color due to stress
 aap agar aapane baalo ko safed hone se rokna chaahate hai, to tanaav se dur rahen
 3
 dhumrapaan-dhumrapaan bhi baalo ke kam umr main hi safed hone kaa ek kaaran he
 According to a study published in 2013, people who smoke are 25 percent more likely to have quick white hair
 iske alaava bhi dhumrapaan kii aadat sehat ko gambhir rup se nuksaan pahunchaati he

 Hair becomes dry and dry due to unbalance of hormones
 baalo kii chamak khatm ho jaati he
 Also, hair loss problem is also common
 5
 Unhealthy diet has a direct effect on health
 isliye diet kaa khaas khyaal rakhana bahut jaruri hota he
 Actually, due to lack of nutrients in the diet, hair turns white at an early age

 Prabhas and Shraddha Kapoor starrer film Saaho failed to impress the audience and the critics
 haalanki baavjood iske film box offis par acha bijness kar rahi he
 The film's tremendous promotion and marketing are being used by the makers and at least the movie tickets are being sold
 haalanki phir bhi ye sawaal jarur he ki 350 karod rupee ke bajet se bani itani baari bharkam film kaa bajet mekars kaise nikaalenge?spotboy ne apni ek report main yuvi criations ke produsar se baatcheet ko prakashit kiya he
 According to the report, when producer Shyam was asked that when Saho was going to be made in the budget of 150 crores, then its budget reached 350 crores
 ab is paise ko nikaalane ke liye mekars ke paas kya plan he? to is sawaal par shyaam chakaraate se najar aae
 He said, "it's just speculation
" aap hi log pehle 150 karod kaa aankada leki saamne aae or phir kaha ki film 350 karod rupee main ban rahi he
 "the producer was then reminded that the lead actor of the film, Prabhas himself, has said in several interviews that the budget of the film is Rs 350 crore
 is par produsar shyaam ne kaha, "to phir mujhe lagata he ki mekars ne kuch to planning kii hogi ki kis tarah paisa nikaala jayega
 "you know that Saoh was filled with a lengthy star cast, while the film did not require such a big cast for many scenes

 gajiabad ke indirapuram main rah rahe pradeep shrivastav kaa home lone isi saal khatm ho gaya
 It was a pleasure to finish the loan, but there was also a concern that from next year on the income tax return, the benefit of home loan on interest and principal would not be available
 pradeep kii maujuuda vittiya sthiti doosraa makaan kharidne ke liye makul lagati he
 But the big question is whether the second house will get the benefit of income tax like the first house? First home loan, how much benefit is the home loan plays a big role in saving tax
 kisi bhi karadaata ko home lone ke bhugtan par 2 lakh rupye tak ke byaaj or 1
 There is a tax benefit on principal up to Rs 5 lakh
 yah 1
 The limit of Rs 5 lakh is found under Section 80C
 yani homelon ke baad kisi karadaata ko 80 si kii kisi anya mad main tex bachaane ke liye nivesh karne kii jarurat nahin hoti he
 What is on the home loan of the second house According to Chartered Accountant Ankit Gupta, the tax benefit of buying a second house depends on the status of the taxpayer whether he is living in that house himself or not
 agar koi karadaata makaan main khud rah rahaa he to use home lone ke byaaj par adhiktam 2 lakh rupye kaa tex benefit milegaa lekin agar us makaan main nahin rah rahaa to home lone par diya jane vaale puraa byaaj section 24(bi) ke antargat kar mukt hoga
 There is no tax benefit on the amount paid as interest
 yah phayda yah bhi hedgar kisi vyakti ne makaan joint lone lekar kharid rakhaa he or makaan ke joint oner he to tex benefit kaa phayda donon karadaataaon ko hoga
 Suppose from the example, 1 to a taxpayer on the principal of the home loan
 5 lakh or byaaj par 2 lakh rupye kaa benefit miltaa he or joint benefit main yah laabh 7 lakh rupye ho jayega
 That is, both taxpayers can take tax benefit by paying principal and interest equally *** bal mazdooree maamle par 8 tivi nirmaataa musiibat main pad sakate hai

 The interview of 'the Interview', which has been in controversy due to the scenes of the murder of North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, seems to be increasing difficulties

 Activists of one of India's leading controversial organizations, on the condition of anonymity, said that there is no point in knowing the story or watching the film to protest against 'the Interview'
 iske pehle wo bina dekhe ‘pike’ kaa bhi safaltaapurvak virodh kar chuke hai, jiske parinamswaroop film puure desh ke cinemagharon se utaar lee gai or buree tarah flop hui
 The reason for North Korea's recourse to point-based organizations is the specific ability of these organizations to remove hair from the skin once found
 is sab kii shuruyaat tab hui jab uttar korea ke neshnal dephence kamishan pramukh ko ek charchit miseging ap par wo audio mila, jisamen bharat main salbhar baad relies hone ja rahi ‘bajrangi bhaijan’ ke 'lav jehad' ko badhaava detii film bataakar virodh karne kii baat kahi gai thi
 It has also started showing its effect on social networking sites
 tivetor par 'boycott intervyuu' trend kar rahaa he
 At the same time, ten questions are being asked on Facebook, why only North Korea is made fun of in the film? Why not South Korea? Many people are also saying that why do not the Korea chief interviewee go to Syria or Arabia and take the interview? Some have also urged the goldsmiths across the country to stop buying gold items, opposing 'sony'

 newjiland ke purv cricketer brendan makkulam apni dhamaakedaar ballebaaji ke liye jane jate hai, isi bich australia main jari big bash lig main unki fielding cricket ke itihaas main darj ho gai he
 He was posted at log on Sunday against the Brisbane Heat at the Sydney Cricket Ground, when a brilliant shot was fired that was flying out of the boundary flying in the air but Brendon mccullum tried to stop him in a great way
 It was a compliment
 haalanki vah kaich to le nahin paae lekin unhone ran jarur bachaa liye
 This filming of mccullum became one of the most memorable moments of this match
 makkulam ne yah karnama 16wein over main kiya tha jab sidney sixrs kii ore se khel rahe james vince 46 bolon main 75 ran banaakar khel rahe the or unhone log on ke upar se chakka maarane kii koshish kii thi
 No catch but how did Brendon mccullum stop this from going for a boundary !? # BBL08 | @bkttirespic
 twitter
 com / bzagw88nq7 mccullum had almost taken the catch but before he went out of the boundary he bounced the ball into the air
 lekin uske baad vah santulan nahin banaae rakh sake or dobaaraa ball ko kaich nahin kar paae
 When he first caught the ball, no part of his body was touched by the boundary line
 haalanki isko lekar twitor par bahes bhi shuru ho gai he
 According to earlier rules in cricket, this shot would have been called outside the boundary but now the rule of cricket has changed
 saal 2013 se jari nae niyam ke mutabik fildir ko pehle boundry ke andar ball rokna hoga, agar usne hawa main ball ko rokna he to use boundry ke andar hi ball ko chhod dena hoga
 Because mccullum first bounced and caught the catch, then released the ball before going out of the boundary and the second time he caught the ball twice near the boundary and threw it inside
 Should be changed to a 6 under Law 19

 However, Arora said that only parliamentary secretariat or legislature can declare a seat vacant under procedural rules

 iske alaava is gane ko likhaa he irshaad kamil ne
 Salman Khan will be seen entertaining the audience in both his innocent and dabang adang in double role, which is going to release on Diwali
 dekhen film 'prem ratan dhan payo' kaa tital trek: Generally, in the politics of coalition like Lalu Prasad Yadav, the consummate leader rarely lets the hand go away
 phir, gathjod unke grih-pradesh main ho to maamla or pukhta ho jaataa he, jahaan ve kareeb 15 saal tak raaj kar chuke hai
 While he himself was the Chief Minister for half the time, the next half term, with wife Rabri Devi as the Chief Minister, took over the reins from behind the scenes
 lekin bihar jaise-jaise vidhansabha chunaavon main utar rahaa he, chatur lalu ke haath se baaji chhootati najar aa rahi he
 He probably thought that he would outnumber Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, who was badly defeated in the Lok Sabha elections last year
 lihaaja, unki party argedy ne rajya kii kul 243 siton main se 145 par daawa thok diya
 Lalu himself has criticized the JD (U) model of "good governance" and his supporters have pointed out that Nitish is not the best candidate for the post of Chief Minister
 par nitish is par kuch aise ade ki argedy pramukh ne kalpana bhi nahin kii thi
 He did not attend the 22 May meeting of Lalu and Mulayam Singh Yadav convened in New Delhi to cement the merger of the Janata Parivar and did not attend a public meeting with Lalu in Patna on 30 May
 phir pradesh jedy (you) adhyaksh basishtha narayan singh ne elaan kar diya ki vilay to hone se rahaa
 Nitish opened his cards on 7 June
 ve rahul gandhi se mili or congress upaadhyaksh ke karibiyon ne sanket diya ki ghotaale se daagdar lalu ke badale congress nitish par daanv lagaana pasand karegi
 This caused Lalu's desires to fade
 congress se bhi gathjod kii sambhaavna na rahane se apane siyaasi astitv par hi sankat dekh lalu ne lagbhag samarpan kar diya
 In the next 24 hours, he accepted Nitish's leadership and confessed that he was ready to "drink poison" to defeat the BJP
 haalanki rajya main congress ke mahaj paanch vidhayak hai par mana jaataa he ki use yahaan 17 fisadi musalamaanon kaa samarthan praapt he
 In fact, at the age of 68, Lalu, convicted in the fodder scam, aspires to establish his children in politics but is no longer a manipulative drug
 phir, akele chunaav main utarana koi vikalp nahin ho saktaa tha
 In the first round, Nitish is of course overwhelmed, but the bet has already started
 ab nitish ke saamne lalu kii rajamandi se siton ke bantwaare kii chunauti he, jo aasaan nahin he
 For this, Lalu and Nitish have decided to form a six-member committee
 isamen do raay nahin ki har seat par ant tak khinchataan hogi
 The JD (U) wants to form the basis for sharing the 115 seats it won in the 2010 assembly elections, which it won while in the NDA
 to argedy 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaavon ko aadhaar bananaa chahta he, jisamen use 145 vidhansabha kshetron main badhat mili thi
 In such a situation, Nitish may have to cut the ticket of some of his mlas to give 100-100 seats to RJD and JD (U) besides 43 seats to Congress and NCP
 isse jedy(you) hi nahin, argedy main bhi baghawat ke bulbule uth sakate hai
 Nitish's second challenge is to bring Lalu's traditional Yadav vote bank into the JD (U) court
 rajya main 14 fisadi aabaadi ke saath yadav sabase bada jati samooh he
 But Yadav cannot go to JD (U) outright and no one knows this better than Lalu
 ve is vot bank ko ramvilas paswan kii ore nahin kar sake the
 The two fought together in the 2009 Lok Sabha and 2010 Assembly elections
 isse bhi bada sawaal yah he ki kya maat khaae lalu mukhyamantri awaas main nitish ko dobaaraa sthapit karne ke liye puure damakham ke saath jutenge? nitish sarkaar main ek varisht mantri kehete hai, “nitish ke liye sabase badi mushkil lalu par unki nirbharta sabit hogi
 What hope is there for those who accept their leadership as being poison poisoned? ” The Congress has also advised Nitish not to get caught in the trick of Chatur Lalu
 lekin nitish ke liye raahat kii baat yah he ki unki party chunavi uthapatak ke bich lagaataar unke saath khadi dikhti he
 Even when he risked losing the Dalit votes by showing Jitanram Manjhi an out-of-the-way route and has now challenged Lalu, who claims a large vote bank
 nitish ke liye raahat kii baat yah bhi he ki lalu kii mushkilen bhi kam nahin hai
 Lalu is eager for his party's better performance this time to overcome the electoral defeat for almost a decade
 argedy ne aakhri baar 2004 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main behatar pradarshan kiya tha
 Now Lalu wants to hand over his legacy to his sons and his daughter Misa Bharti and sons Tejashwi and Tej Pratap can contest the assembly elections this time
 aise main lalu ko nitish kii utani hi darkaar he jitani nitish ko unki he
 Although the bet has already started for Nitish, but if the Janata Parivar Alliance wins the seat-sharing battle and wins the election, then Nitish's next challenge will be the sharing of power
 lekhak, nirdeshak or abhinayta niraj vora kii maut se unke parivaar or bollywood ko bada nuksaan hua kyonki wo bahu pratibha ke maalik the
 No one else has suffered a major setback with regret over his death and that is model-turned-artist Roslyn Khan
 niraj vora kii maut ke baad jatke ke saath-saath bollywood main pahchaan banane kaa unka sapana ek baar phir tut gaya
 Actually Neeraj Vora signed Roslyn Khan for a film 'bhabhi Online'
 roselin ko puri ummid thi ki is film se unhen bollywood main naam banane kaa acha mauqaa milegaa magar aisa nahin hua or film shuru hone se pehle niraj duniya ko alavida kah gaye
 The comments isse pehle bhi roselin kaa sapana tab tutaa tha jab ramgopal verma kii film bhi kabhi patari par aa hi nahin saki
 Ram Gopal Varma was about to make a film called 'savita Bhabhi' with Roslyn Khan but she could not make it
 roselin ne kaha ki ''mujhe lagata he ki abtak mere naseeb ne bollywood main meraa saath nahin diya he
 Naseeb has cheated me twice when i was going to be a part of two big films which were going to be made by two big Bollywood filmmakers
 sabase pehle ramgopal verma kii film 'savita bhabhi' ruk gai jisamen main kaam karne vaali thi
 That film could not begin
 uske baad niraj ji mujhe lekar ek film bana rahe the jiskaa naam tha 'bhabhi online' magar in film ke shuru hone se pehle wo chal based
 i am very sorry for his death because he was very talented
 " roselin ko ummid he ki aane vaala nayaa saal unke liye shaayad kuch nai khushi lekar aae kyonki ab wo nae sire se apane kaam ke liye khojbin shuru kar chuki hai or 2-3 filmkaaron se unki baat chal rahi he
 Even before this, Roslyn's dream was broken when Ram Gopal Varma's film could never come back on track
 ramgopal verma roselin khan ko lekar 'savita bhabhi' naam kii ek film banane vaale the magar wo film nahin ban saki
 Roslyn said, "I feel that till now my destiny has not supported me in Bollywood
" do baar naseeb ne mujhe dhokhaa diya he jab main do badi filmon kaa hissaa banane ja rahi thi jise bollywood ke do bade filmkaar banane ja rahe the
 First of all Ramgopal Varma's film 'savita Bhabhi' stopped in which i was going to work
 wo film shuru ho hi nahin pai
 After that Neeraj ji was making a film with me called 'bhabhi Online' but he passed away before the start of these films
 mujhe behad afsos he unki maut kaa kyonki wo bahut hi pratibhashali the
 "roslyn hopes that the coming new year may bring some new joy for her as she has now started anew for her work and is in talks with 2-3 filmmakers
 sabase pehle ramgopal verma kii film 'savita bhabhi' ruk gai jisamen main kaam karne vaali thi
 That film could not begin
 uske baad niraj ji mujhe lekar ek film bana rahe the jiskaa naam tha 'bhabhi online' magar in film ke shuru hone se pehle wo chal based
 i am very sorry for his death because he was very talented
 " roselin ko ummid he ki aane vaala nayaa saal unke liye shaayad kuch nai khushi lekar aae kyonki ab wo nae sire se apane kaam ke liye khojbin shuru kar chuki hai or 2-3 filmkaaron se unki baat chal rahi he

 rahul gandhi ke pradhanmantri narendra modi par lagaae aaropon ke baad bijepi ne bhi javaabi hamalaa shuru kar diya he
 First Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad responded to Rahul Gandhi's allegations
 uske baad ek ke baad ek bijepi ke netaa or mantri rahul gandhi ke aaropon par pradhanmantri ke bachaav main utar aae hai
 Minister of State for Home Kiran Rijiju has also raised questions on Rahul Gandhi's allegations while defending Prime Minister Modi
 kiran rigiju kaa kahana he ki rahul gandhi kii baton ko syriasli lenaa nahin chahie, koi unako syriasli nahin letaa he
 Who is called a scam, scam is what Congress did
 jo congress ne 2G kaa ghotaalaa, koyale kaa ghotaalaa, adarsh ghotaalaa, helicopter ghotaalaa jisamen desh kaa hajaar karod nahin, lakhon karodon kaa lut hua vah asli ghotaalaa he
 Does paper hoist in the air like this? grih rajyamantri bole kipradhanmantridesh ke liye kaam kar rahe he, ham sabhi kaam kar rahe hai
 All this is being done to divert attention, in which he will not succeed
 ham apana kaam karte rahenge, supreme court main bhi jis kaagaj ko sangyaan main nahin liya use hawa main kaagaj laharaa karke aisi baaten karnaa or pradhanmantri ke bare main anaap-shanaap baaten karata shobhaa nahin detaa
 Regarding the cleanliness given by the Prime Minister, Kiran Rijiju says that answers would have been given to him, in which there should be some strength, we should not take them seriously
 desh kaa koi vyakti rahul gandhi ko syriasli nahin letaa he
 It is known to everyone that there is no point in any case in the allegations made
 court ne bhi kah diya ki is par koi cese nahin banataa he
 Sharad Yadav said that it has already been revealed that the JD (U) senior leader Sharad Yadav said that the Congress vice president of the Congress had dropped the diary bomb, this charge was not made by Rahul Gandhi for the first time
 supreme court main cese chal rahaa he court ne sunwaayee ke liye agali tarikh di he, prashanth bhushan ji is maamle ko lard rahe hai
 Sharad Yadav said that Arvind Kejriwal also revealed about this in the Delhi Legislative Assembly
 rahul ke khulaase par bukamp aane par sharad yadav bole ki main is par tippanee nahin karuunga, meri prashanth bhushan se baat hui he unka kahana he unke paas or dastauez hai
 He is a very serious person, hearing on this issue in the High Court on the 11th, will be the milk of milk and water of water
 rajeev pratap rudi kaa rahul par warrahul ke aaropon par kendriya mantri rajeev pratap rudi ne kaha ki rahul gandhi ko ye pataa nahin hi nahin ki jo aarope unhone piem par lagaae he unhen supreme court khaarij kar chukaa he
 Rudy said that when something happens in the country, Rahul Gandhi is abroad, so he has no information about the country, if someone tells him, then he speaks
 jo document rahul ke paas he unhen court pehle hi nakaar chukaa he, unke is ravaiye ke kaaran hi congress desh bhar main simatati ja rahi he
 At the same time, Rudy said on Lalu Yadav that Lalu should see himself first, he is himself a court judge
 court ne to unke chunaav ladane par roak laga di he, lalu ne chaara ghotaale main paisa khaakar puri duniya main apana naam kar diya he
 Taking a dig at Kejriwal, Rudy said that Kejriwal's land is being moved, now that he says anything, people do not believe him
 kendriya mantri ramvilas paswan ne kaha ki rahul gandhi kya bolte hai kya nahin bolte hai pataa nahin, lekin jo vah aarope laga rahe hai unako supreme court pehle hi riject kar chukaa he
 Speaking about himself, he said that why my name will be in the diary is not my name

 He then worked at the Vikram Sarabhai Space Center
 bhaage bhaage aate the or jaldi jaldi khate the
 Parameswaran and he would have had 20 meetings after becoming president

 The Kannada film 'billion Dollar Baby' was also inspired by Kalam's life
 is shortfilm kii khaasiyat thi iskaa nirdesan 19 saal kii shreya dinakar ne kiya tha
 Kalam Saheb, who came out to show the world dreams, also had an unfulfilled dream
 ve payalat bananaa chaahate the
 As a pilot in 1958 Airforce went to Dehradun for selection but had only eight seats and came in ninth place
 physical agzaam clear nahin kar paye or payalat banane kii jagah vaigyanik ban gaye
 Like ordinary students, Kalam also struggled with the big questions of life under the influence of his failure
 unhone apni kitaab My Journey: Transforming Dreams into Actions main likhaa he, 'mujhe yaad he test main fail hone ke baad meraa dil kitna dukhaa
 
 
 i felt the pain of breaking such a great desire very close
 
 
 agali subah main rishikesh pahunchaa
 
 
 i took a dip in the Ganges
 
 
 ganga wo nadi jiskaa naam maine itnaa suna tha lekin pehali baar use dekh rahaa tha uskaa anubhav kar rahaa tha
 
 
 i was told about the Sivananda Ashram of Rishikesh
 
 
 main vahaan gaya
 
 
 As i entered the ashram, i felt a strange wave that brought relief to my restless soul
 
 
 chaaron ore sadhu baithe hue the dhyaan main tallin
 
 
 i felt that someone would answer the questions bothering me, calm my worries
 
 
 mujhe swami shivanand se milane kaa mauka mila
 
 
 He did not mind my being a Muslim
 
 
 balki isse pehle ki main kuch bolta unhone mujhase meri chintaa ke bare main puch liya
 
 
 i was surprised how they realized my trouble
 
 
 unhone kaha tumhaara muskabil air force kaa payalat bananaa nahin he
 
 
 What you want to become is already decided
 lekin kuch banane ke baad bhi unka yah adhuraa sapana peechha karata rahaa
 Even after becoming President, he persecuted that the pilot could not be made
 jaipur litarechar festival main unhone is dard ko saajha karte hue bataaya ki 2005 main jab main raashtrapati tha to vayusena pramukh mere paas aae
 i told him that i could never fulfill my dream of becoming a pilot, the Air Force chief told me to take a little training and then i finally flew for forty minutes in April 2007 from Lohegaon Air Force Base in Pune to Sukhoi 30 MKI fighter aircraft
 ye kisi bhi raashtrapati kii pehali udaan thi
 This flight changed the office and stature of the President forever in the eyes of the soldiers and the army
 apane commander ko akaash main morcha sambhalate dekh kis jawan kaa hausala nahin badha hoga
 The journey of his life started from 1931
 dwitiya vishwayuddh ke asar ko unhone apane rameswaram main bhi jhela or yaad kiya
 In the last few years, his close aide Sreejan Pal Singh has mentioned the last things on his Facebook page
 saadhe gyaarah baje kalam sahab kaa antim twit aata he ki main ai iem shilong ja rahaa hum
 To deliver a lecture on the topic Creating a Livable Planet Earth
 is twit ke baad baarah baje kalam sahab guwahati jane ke liye vimaan se ravaanaa hote hai
 While sitting down, Srjan Pal Singh praised his black suit
 dhai ghante kii yatra ke dauraan kai baar vimaan ne monsooni badalon ke bich hichkole bhi khaaye
 It was a normal thing for him
 unhone hilte hue jahaaz main jab bhi mujhe daraa hua dekha, khidki ke parde hataae or baahar dekhte hue kaha ki ab tumhen dar nahin lagegaa
 Srijan writes that after this, for two and a half hours we left by road to IIM Shillong
 paanch ghante ke dauraan wo mujhase baaten karte rahe, charchaa karte rahe
 It was the last of hundreds of aircraft and road trips made with him in the last six years, every visit was special
 aakiri daure main doctor kalam punjab main aatankwaadi hamale ko lekar kaafii chintit dikhe
 He was saddened by the death of innocent people
 im shilong main unhen Creating a Livable Planet Earth vishay par vyaakhyaan dena tha
 Linking the incident of Punjab to the subject, he said that it seems like man-made forces have become a greater threat to the earth, just like pollution
 iske baad hamane hinsa, pradooshan or prakruti main insaani dakhal par baatcheet kii or kaha ki aise main to dharti rahane laayak nahin rah jaaegi
 He said that maybe in the next thirty years, the earth will be in such a bad condition, so you people will have to do something for it immediately
 unki antim chintaaon main yah baat bhi shaamil thi ki sansad main kaise gatirodh khatm ho
 What to do that should be debated
 baat ho
 Be communicated
 unka maananaa tha ki gatirodh thik nahin he
 The comments doctor kalam ne kaha ki maine apane kaarykaal main do alag-alag sarkaron ko dekha he
 We must find a way to use Parliament for development politics
 phir unhone mujhe kaha ki main im shilong ke chaatro ke liye sarprize esinment queshyan taiyaar karun jinhen wo lacture ke akhir main chaatro ko den
 He wanted the students to suggest unique ways to make Parliament better and effective
 lekin phir kuch der baad unhone mujhase kaha ki main unase samaadhaan dene ke liye kaise kah saktaa hum jab mere hi paas iskaa koi samaadhaan nahin he
 For the next one hour, we kept trying to find solutions on this issue
 ham lacture haul pahunche
 
 
 He did not want to be late for the lecture
 
 
 wo hameshaa kehete the ki chaatro ko intazaar nahin karaayaa janaa chahie
 
 
 i immediately put their mic on
 
 
 lacture par baat kii or computer ke aage baith gaya
 
 
 When i was putting him on the mic he said with a laugh "funny guy! Are you doing well? Dr
 kalam ke 'funny guy' kehane ke kai matlab hote the
 
 
 According to their voice and atmosphere, you had to guess yourself
 
 
 iskaa ye bhi matlab ho saktaa tha ki aapane acha kiya or ye bhi ki aapane kuch gadabad kar di he
 
 
 During my stay with him for six years, i had learned to figure out the meaning of saying 'funny guy'
 
 
 so isliye jab unhone "funny guy! Are you doing well kaha to maine muskuraakar kaha "yes" ye mujhase unke aakiri shabd the
 
 
 i was sitting behind them
 
 
 bhaashan shuru hone ke do minute baad unhone ek lanbaa pos liya
 
 
 After completing a long sentence, he stopped and then fell down
 
 
 hamane unhen uthaaya
 
 
 The doctor came
 
 
 unhone puri koshish kii
 
 
 i can never forget his half-eyed eyes
 
 
 maine ek haath se unka sir thama hua tha or doctoron ne unhen waapas hosh main laane kii koshish kii lekin wo nahin uthe
 
 
 He did not say a word, he did not even see the pain
 
 
 shaam chaar baje ke baad logon ke aane kaa silsilaa shuru ho gaya
 Every visitor brought his memories with him
 koi kavita likhakar aayaa tha, koi aate hi bhavuk ho gaya
 APJ Abdul Kalam is followed by 14 lakh people on Twitter
 unke kareebi sahyogiyon ne kaha he ki ve unke aadhakirik twitor acount ko band nahin karenge balki ek naye naam se chalaayenge
 Srajan Pal Singh has told that he will now be the administrator of his Twitter account
 ab kalam kaa khaataa 'in memory of Dr Kalam' ke naam se chalegaa
 Kalam's new book 'advantage India' with Srjan Pal Singh is to be released this year
 farvari 2011 se kalam samayik muddon par apane vichaar twitor par likhte rahe the
 Hashtag 'kalamsir' on Twitter is trending at the top since Monday night
