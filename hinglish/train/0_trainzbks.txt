 There is bad news for the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh from Kerala, which is in the news for violent clashes between supporters of the BJP and Communist parties

 whatsapp can be expensive to use
 desh kii telecom companiyaan is baat se naaraaz hai ki whatsap, skip, ve-chat jaise soshal media plateform unki moti kamai par asar daal rahe hai
 With their increasing use, people are now using less mobile phones and SMS
 logon ne whatsap par bade-bade yujar group bana liye hai or muft main ek duusare tak sandesh pahunchaate rahete hai
 Telecom companies say that they have taken a license after spending billions of rupees and they have the right to communicate here, so how can other agencies or companies bypass them and get it done
 isliye in companiyon ne tri yani telecom regulatory athurity of india kaa daaman thama he ki vah koi bada kadam uthaae
 Now TRAI can consider the matter how the platforms like whatsapp are impacting the earnings of the telecom companies
 telecom companiyaan chaahati hai ki tri un par kuch shulk lagaae yaa unhen unase kuch dilwaaye
 Interestingly, the revenue of telecom companies in India is increasing continuously and the number of users is increasing here
 iske baavjood ve chaahati hai ki anya sroton se paise aaen
 Now the ball is in the court of TRAI which will consider it but it will also be very difficult for him because there is no such law in the country
 phir bhi whatsap yuj karne waalon ko aane vaale samay kaa intjaar karnaa hoga
 Now, to see what action TRAI takes

 BJP President Amit Shah means a lot to many people
 ab jab pradhanmantri narendra modi kii bijepi sarkaar apane kaarykaal kaa pehla varsh puraa kar rahi he, nai dilli ke satta ke galiyaaron seek nae shah ubharate hai: sabko ekajute karne vaale shah
 While his guru is sowing the seeds of good days amid the policy paralysis that has been going on for years, Shah has his eyes set on 2019
 2014 kii chunavi badhat ko neenv maanakar aage nirmaan hona he or vistaar kiya janaa he, jila str par jin netaaon or kaaryakartaaon ne 282 kii is jaadui sankhya ko rachane ke liye pasinaa bahaya he, unhen apane man kii baat kehane or apane path par date rahane ke liye prerit karnaa he
 That is, since becoming the party president 9 months ago, visiting every state of the country at least once and meeting the leaders of bjp's 580 district units
 is prakriya ne unhen apane chust sanghathan kii shaktiyon, kamajoriyon, chunautiyon or simaaon ko bhi pratyaksh rup se samajhane kaa mauka diya he, or vah sanghathan duniya kii sabase badirajnatik party kaa tajpahan chukaa he
 Then there is also the task of defending the party's first year in power, and putting forth its initial achievements, pushing back critics and making new friends

 Excerpts: Has the feeling of being the ruling party at the center come to dominate the mind? The feeling of being a ruling party came only when we were in the campaigning period
 hamen apni jimmedaari or kaam kii gambhirtha kaa ehsaas usee dauraan gaya tha
 This is not the first time this has happened
 1967 se 2014 tak hamen kai rajyon main bahumat mila he, kuch sthanon par hamane gathbandhan sarkarein banaai hai
 In some places we have ruled with a two-thirds majority
 2014 main mili satta bijepi ke liye koi nai cheez nahin he
 Your party is the first party to get a clear majority in 30 years
 kya isse ummiden nahin badhin hai or kya yah baat chunauti paidaa nahin karti he?yah hamaare loktantr ke liye acchhee baat he
 Whether it is a coalition government or a single-party government, the challenges remain the same
 ham spasht bahumat hone ke baavjood ab bhi ek gathbandhan sarkaar chalaa rahe hai
 It is the government of the National Democratic Alliance
 logon kii ummiden koi chunauti nahin he, yah jimmedaari he
 But you do not have alliances that your predecessor had to face
 vah gathbandhan kii majaburi nahin thi
 He lacked political will
 hamane bhi ek gathbandhan sarkaar chalaai, lekin hamaare liye gathbandhan kii aisi koi majaburi nahin thi
 Despite this, the BJP, as the ruling party, has taken a U-turn on the important issues that it had adopted while in opposition
 chaahe vah bangladesh ke saath bhoomi seemaa samjhauta ho, jiesti, bhoomi adhigrahan kanoon yaa aadhaar ho
 Was it just a politics of convenience? The BJP never said that the GST bill should not be passed
 hamaara stand yah tha ki rajyon ko jiesti ke kaaran hone vaale nuksaan kii purti kii jaani chahie
 We have tried to meet most of the demands of the state governments through the 14th Finance Commission and ensure compensation in lieu of GST
 agar is par sahmati pehle ho jaati, to jiesti pehle hi ab tak lagu ho gaya hota
 There has been no change in our stand on the land border agreement with Bangladesh
 hamane assam ko isse pruthak rakhane kii maang kii thi or ham ab bhi vahi chaahate hai
 We introduced amendments for that
 lekin chunki yah sanvaidhanik sanshodhan he, jiske liye do-tihaai bahumat kii jarurat hoti he, isliye vito congress ke haath main he
 We had two options
 yaa to apane rukh se aditol dhang se chipke rahete yaa bangladesh seemaa par baad lagaana sunishchit karte
 As a government and political party, it is better to ensure fencing to help prevent illegal infiltration
 yahaan tak ki bhoomi adhigrahan bill ke maamle main bhi, sansad main sirf do din charchaa hui
 The bill was passed in a hurry
 lekin vidheyak kii is aatma par sahmati thi ki kisaanon ko uchit muaavja milanaa chahie, kisaanon or khet mazdooron ke punarvaas ke liye praavdhaan hona chahie
 There was a principled consensus among all in Parliament
 jab vyaavhaarik kriyanvayan kaa mauka aayaa, to yah baat saamne ai ki kai chizon ko sahi karnaa aavashyak he
 We have to come to Parliament for this
 main ek baat spasht karnaa chahta hum ki is kadam main nijee udyogon yaa badi companiyon ko bhoomi uplabdh karaane kii pariklpana kahin nahin he
 Farmers are going to get better compensation
 bhoomi kii kharid band nahin hone ja rahi he
 As far as Aadhaar is concerned, we opposed Aadhaar-based citizenship
 kisi sarpanch kii ghoshnaa ke boote naagarikta kaa faisla nahin hona chahie
 We opposed it on the basis of national security
 rajyasabha main sankhya ne loksabhaa main 282 kii seemaa ko ujagar kar diya he
 The work of my party and our government is to bring positive changes in Parliament
 sansad main sankhya janata ko tay kerani he
 The mathematics of the Rajya Sabha is against us
 vipaksh ko raajnneeti nahin kerani chahie or yogyata ke aadhaar par vidheyakon kaa samarthan karnaa chahie
 If they do not do so, it is not my party's fault
 pichley saal kai rajya vidhansabha chunaavon main party kii jeet kaa shrey aapako diya gaya he
 Who should take the blame for the defeat of Delhi? As far as the credit is concerned, the credit goes to the lakhs of party workers who have worked day and night to get success
 jahaan tak dilli kii haar kaa sambandh he, ham kaarnon kaa vishleshan kar rahe hai or kaaphi had tak yah vishleshan kar chuke hai
 But i am not going to disclose it publicly
 par meraa maananaa he ki hamen kisi bhi haar ko halke main nahin lenaa chahie
 The BJP has taken this very seriously and necessary changes are being made in our strategy and our administration
 jammu-kashmir main bijepi or pidipi kii gathbandhan sarkaar banane se party ke apane kaaryakartaaon ke bich bhram paidaa ho gaya ki party anuchhed 370 ko nirast karne kii apni raay se palat gai he
 Has the party's opinion on this matter changed? We do not have the necessary numbers
 ham anuchhed 370 par kuch nahin kar sakate
 It cannot keep us stuck
 yah janata kaa diya janadesh tha
 This is an experiment which the people of this country and BJP workers should see
 kya yah prayog chah saal tak chalegaa?main is par zyada kuch nahin kah saktaa
 But it is so certain that this experiment will not harm the integration of Jammu and Kashmir as well as the unity and integrity of the country
 hamen agle saal assam main bhi aisa hi prayog dekhne ke liye taiyaar rahanaa chahie?assam main hamen spasht bahumat milegaa
 While in opposition, BJP always praised bjp-ruled states in its national executive meeting
 lekin is baar sirf do rajyon—maharashtra or haryana—kii tarif kii gai he or vah bhi gomance par pratibandh lagane ke liye
 Do you think there is a possibility of imposing a national ban on beef? All (bjp-ruled) states are doing well
 maharashtra or haryana kii tarif gomance par pratibandh lagane ke kanoon ke liye kii gai thi
 This law is already in place in other (bjp-ruled) states
 jahaan tak rashtriya pratibandh kaa sawaal he, iske liye aam sahmati kii jarurat he
 But my party believes that it is under the guiding principles of the Constitution
 ham vishwaas karte hai ki gohatya par pratibandh lagaaya janaa chahie
 Wherever the BJP government is, we have imposed this ban
 hamen kya khaanaa chahie or kya nahin, yah sarkaar ko hamen kyon bataanaa chahie?har vyakti ko ek-duusare kii bhaawanaaon kaa sammaan karnaa chahie
 If it needs some changes, they should

 You came to power on the slogan of development, but elements within the saffron family and sometimes your party members also stand in favor of things like 'homecoming', 'hindu women have four children', 'love jihad' Go
 sattarudh party ke adhyaksh ke rup main, aapkaa is par kya kahana he?yah na to bijepi kaa stand he or na hi ham in bayanon kaa samarthan karte hai
 These are personal statements of the people and should be taken as personal statements only
 bijepi ke dastavejon main lav jihad kaa koi zikr nahin kiya gaya he, yah media kaa gadha hua tha
 Wasn't the party hesitating to distance itself from these controversies? No, have i not done the same thing yet? Such statements should not be given
 
 Niranjan Jyoti, V
 ke
 What is your advice for the leaders of your party like Singh and Giriraj Singh whose comments cause controversy? Everyone should follow moderation
 kya isse yah sabit nahin hota he ki bijepi main koi aantarik niyantran nahin he or log jo chaahate hai, vah kah sakate hai? kya is tarah kii dharna aapaki party ko nuksaan nahin pahunchaati he?vah mujh par chhod den
 i believe that these things cannot detract from our pro-development agenda
 agar koi kuch bayaan detaa he, to isse hamaare sadak nirmaan kii gati ruk nahin jaati he, isse gaanvon main bijli le jane main pragati ruk nahin jaaegi, na hi isse vidhyalay nirmaan kaary main pragati band ho jaaegi
 These things have no relation with development
 yah media main surkhiyaan batorne ke liye acchhee hai
 But such statements create an atmosphere of fear
 main is par vishwaas nahin karata hum
 No one is afraid of the riots, what will frighten the statement
 dange desh bhar main hue hai, lekin isse samaaj nahin tut gaya he
 They return and stay together again for years
 dange nahin hone chahie
 But society has endured them
 lihaaja bayanon se samaaj main khalal padane kaa koi sawaal nahin he
 But people should not make such statements
 bijepi ne pashchim bengal par dhyaan kendrit kiya
 Despite this, the municipal corporation lost badly

 We have inherited some outstanding problems, we will solve them
 aapako lagata he ki udyog jagat kii kuch apekshaayen vyaavhaarik nahin hai?nahin, yah un (udyog jagat) kii majaburi he
 They are entangled in a maze of the past
 to unka ham se apeksha karnaa swaabhaavik he kyonki ham nai sarkaar hai
 Expectations are expectations
 ham unhen puraa karenge
 The perception is also increasing that your government is anti-farmer and poor
 abhi aapkaa ishaara tha ki ham udyog-virdohi hai, lekin ab aap kah rahe hai ki ham garib virdohi hai
 We are neither of these two
 ham maanate hai ki kheti or udyog kii sakal gharelu utpaada main, rojgaar srijan main or desh ke vikaas main apni bhoomika he or donon ke liye ek santulit niti taiyaar karne kii jarurat he
 BJP is trying to do this
 congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi yah dharna paidaa kar rahe hai ki vyapaar or udyog kii madad karnaa nakaaratmak he
 No person can create an environment
 nishchit maahaul banane ke liye kuch na kuch sachaai honi chahie
 If we were pro-industry, would we (coal) go for 2 lakh crore rupees through auction
 juta sakate the? ham bhi koyala khaanon ko usee tarah baant sakate the, jaise congress ne apni party ke netaaon (vijay) darda or (naveen) jindal ko deen
 We could also distribute 2G spectrum
 hamane paardarshee tareeke se inhen nilaam kiya he
 We have raised Rs 3 lakh crore through them
 se adhik jutaaye hai
 If you want, you can call it pro-industry
 congress ne jo 220 koyala khadaanen or 2ji spectrum baante the, kya vah kisaanon ke liye the? kya gas kii keemat 8 dollar rakhana kisaanon ke liye tha? kya ve korporate samarthak faisle nahin the? sach yah he
 Let them say what they are saying
 lekin chuttee se lautne ke baad se rahul gandhi kaa sakriy hona sarkaar ke liye pareshaani paidaa karne vaala najar aa rahaa he
 Any leader who says anything after being in power for 10 years needs to be asked what he did in those 10 years

 Your alliance partner Shiv Sena is looking angry with BJP or your government
 (ensipi netaa) sharad pavaar ne kaha he ki aapkaa gathbandhan 2017 main hone vaale biemasi chunaav tak nahin chalegaa

 pavaar sahab vipaksh main hai, unako is tarah kii baaten kehani hongi
 They know what they should say to benefit their party
 akali dal netaa naresh gujral ne bhi bijepi sarkaar ke prati hataasha jataai he

 If our partners say something, it will be discussed with them
 akali dal se aapkaa gathbandhan 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav tak tikaa rahegaa?akali dal ke saath hamaara gathbandhan he
 When there is an alliance, why should we think negatively for 2017? What is Bihar's assessment? It is too early to make any assessment
 sthiti ab bhi aspasht he
 Not for us, but also for our opponents
 pehle ve kehete hai, vilay hoga or phir kehete hai vilay nahin hoga, balki gathbandhan hoga
 Has the Janata Parivar merger plan made you nervous? Absolutely not
 pareshaan ve hai or yahi vajah he ki ve ekajute ho rahe hai
 There is no frustration in our favor, frustration is in our rival camp
 yahi vajah he ki ve ek saath ho rahe hai
 We are in a better position
 jo log dar rahe hai, ve vilay kii koshish kar rahe hai
 Is there a possibility of a re-alliance with Nitish Kumar? The question does not arise
 sarkaar par hamalaa karne vaala ek vivaad yah tha ki sarkaar main number do koun he
 You tell who is number two in the government? When number one is there, no one should question about who is number two

 As the president of the ruling party, what challenges do you expect in the next one year? i want to tell you some of the things that we have done in the last one year
 bhrashtachar kaa ek bhi aarope nahin laga he
 We have succeeded in getting the economy back on track
 ham nitigat pakshaaghaat kii sthiti se baahar aa gaye hai
 The government has clearly seen in the first year, whether it is flood in Jammu and Kashmir, earthquake in Nepal or rescue from Yemen

 We have received positive feedback from the world

 What has been learned in the last one year? We still need to learn to deal with the media
 ham koshish kar rahe hai

 rashtravaadi congress party ke pramukh or kendriya krishi mantri sharad pavaar ne saaf kiya he chunaav main siton ke bantwaare ko lekar ensipi or congress ke bich koi matbhed nahin he
 Sharad Pawar dismissed the claim to party workers that the NCP would contest alone if the terms of the alliance were not agreed with the Congress
 ensipi supremeo ne party ke kuch netaaon ke bayaanbaji par naaraazgi jataai
 Significantly, it was reported that if the Congress does not give 145 out of 288 seats to the NCP in the next assembly elections, then the party will contest alone
 pavaar ne kaha, 'mujhe or party kii rajya ikai ke anya netaaon ko iske bare main kuch nahin pataa hai
 Such rhetoric should be avoided in future
 yah hamaari party kaa aadhikarik rukh nahin he
 'it is noteworthy that Pawar's statement has come at a time when there are speculations that Congress MP from Maharashtra can meet party vice president Rahul Gandhi and say that the party should contest all the seats in the next Lok Sabha elections on its own Preparation should be done
 sharad pavaar ne apane bhattije or rajya ke up-mukhyamantri ajit pavaar ke us bayaan ko bhi khaarij kar diya jisamen kaha gaya tha ki 2004 chunaav main zyada seat jeetne ke baavjood mukhyamantri kii kursi congress ko dena ek galat faisla tha

 'panchayat aaj tak' ke paanchave seshan kaa vishay tha '60 saal, 60 maheene, 60 din'
 Apparently, this time period means three different parties
 bijepi ke piem ummidavaar kehete hai ki congress ko is desh ne 60 saal die, unhen bas 60 maheene kaa vakt diya jaae
 In this, the statement 'trump's ace' comes from the government of the Aam Aadmi Party of Delhi, that you should be patient for at least 60 days before bombarding attacks on them
 raajnneeti main vaayade puure karne kii samay-seemaa alag-alag dal kis aadhaar par tay karte hai or votaron par iskaa kya asar hota he, is par baat hui is seshan main
 The top leaders of the Bihar unit were from BJP, Sushil Modi, Union Minister Manish Tiwari from Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party's Front was handled by the youth spokesman Rahul Mehra
 sawaal (susheel modi se): modi kaise 60 maheene main badal denge desh?susheel modi:iskaa matlab ye he ki ek turm to dijie
 If it is good, then people will give a chance
 dekhie bhaashan ke andar janaralij karnaa ek baat he
 Rejuvenation cannot happen within five years
 badlaav laayaa ja saktaa he ki logon ko yakeen ho jaae ki chijen badal sakati hai
 For example, if Atal ji got a chance for 6 years, he showed it by working
 ham bihar main sarkaar main the 7 saal ke liye
 We showed the change
 sawaal (manish tiwari se): manish ji, modi daawa kar rahe hai or unhen sunne ke liye log ikattha ho rahe hai
 Do you really think that what he did in Gujarat and now he claims to do in the country will be true? Manish Tiwari: First thing, Sushil Modi ji, we have been senior to the student and youth movement
 baat katate acha nahin lagata
 He rightly said inhone 6 saal sarkaar chalaai or aisi chalaai ki agle 10 saal mauka nahin mila
 Chandrasekhar ji had the same slogan
 91 main vah kehete the ki 4 maheene banaam 40 saal
 But the country gave the Congress party a chance
 to ye puraani bottle main puraani hi cheez he
 Question (from Rahul Mehra): Kejriwal government asked for 60 days
 aadha vakt ho gaya
 Doing nothing mehara:media ne to hamen 60 minute bhi nahin die
 Gaz started falling
 magar ham swaagat karte hai
 Which was the old politics that people had lost faith in
 hamane logon kaa thodaa bahut vishwaas jagaaya he
 We are saying that there is a five-year government
 hamen bas chaar maheene de dijie
 See, Congress has spent 45 years in bringing Janlokpal
 jise ham jokapaal kehete hai
 We are bringing Janlokpal ye log police or sibiai ko bandhua banaakar rakhte hai
 Question (from Sushil Modi): Modi says everywhere, like he did in Gujarat
 desh bhar main karuunga
 So far, you have got a maximum of 182 seats in the center
 sambhaavna he ki sarkaar banane ke liye aapako gathbandhan par nirbhar rahanaa hoga
 How will we do it? Sushil Modi: The issue is not about Ahmedabad or Delhi
 agar narendra modi 180 par ruk gaye to ham behatar sarkaar nahin de paaenge
 Modi himself believes this
 isliye hamane mishan 272 launch kiya
 It is difficult to run a better government than many partners
 majaburi to atal ji kii bhi thi
 Manmohan was also there
 magar atal ji ne 22 dalon kii sarkaar chalaa kar dikhaai
 But if the main party of the coalition does not get many seats, then there is a problem
 sawaal (susheel modi se): survey dikhaa rahe hai ki aapako 180-200 jitani siten milengi
 So will he be a government like Manmohan too? Sushil Modi: Manmohan government is very weak
 200 ke aasapaas main bhi acchhee sarkaar chal sakati he
 We proved this
 manmohan sarkaar ke liye ham manmohan ko doshi nahin maanate
 Sonia Gandhi feels guilty
 power kisi ke paas or kaam kisi ko saunp diya
 Manmohan did not have the power to make decisions
 sawaal (manish tiwari se): modi kehete hai ki atal ne gathbandhan sarkaar chalaai
 Many infrastructural developments took place
 manish tiwari:kargil, lahore, qandahar
 Everything happened on their time
 jahaan aap ghotaalon kii baat kar rahe hai
 Atal Raj has a long list ranging from migration scam to petrol pump allocation
 vipaksh ke aarope bebuniyaad hai
 upa's Sonia g is the chairperson
 unki ek raay he, jise sarkaar gambhirtha se leti he
 But the allegation is that backseat driving has taken place in 10 years
 galat he
 Sushil ji is not to blame
 ye sangh or bijepi kii karypranali hogi, jise vah samajhate honge
 This will be their own understanding
 magar congress par laga iljaam bebuniyaad he
 Question (from Manish Tiwari): But in the case of corruption do you look any further? Manish Tiwari: You ran a coal scam by telling an approximate imaginary number
 magar jab satya sansadeey cameti report se saamne aayaa, jisamen bijepi bhi shaamil thi
 It was told that the CAG made this report to create sensation
 jahaan tak 2ji ocshan kii baat he
 The NDA was also included in the policy that followed from 1994 to 2005
 hamane supreme court ke nirdesh par faisla badla
 Today call rates are the cheapest in the world
 telecom sector kii haalat bahut acchhee he
 Sushil Modi: i have known Narendra Modi ever since he was an RSS pracharak
 log bebuniyaad aarope lagaate hai
 Our work on allies is going on
 haal main tidipi ke chandrababu naidu se mulaakaat hui
 All the allies were there
 biju janata dal, tiemasi vagairah
 If tomorrow we get more than 200 seats, most of the regional parties will join BJP
 sawaal (susheel modi se): modi ko 200 se kam siten aati hai to sarkaar nahin banani chahie?susheel modi: atal ji kii sabhaayen maine dekhi hai
 Never more than one lakh people came
 magar aaj tikat lekar bhi chaar-chaar lakh log aa rahe hai
 What you are imagining will not happen
 janata ne man bana liya he
 All surveys will fail
 log cast or party se upar uthakar vot daalana chaah rahe hai
 Now the people of the country do not want a fractured mandate
 aaj main jo desh kaa mood dekh rahaa hum
 Saw it before 77
 mujhe ummid he ki purna bahumat milegaa
 Question (from Manish Tiwari): BJP says that Modi is flexible
 vah bhi atal kii tarah gathbandhan juta sakate hai
 Manish: What he did in Gujarat
 vah desh main karenge, to satyanaash ho jayega
 The way minorities were killed there
 bharat kii kalpana ko todaa-maroda gaya
 He has no example in the history of India
 gathbandhan kii sarkarein is desh kii vaastaviktaa hai
 But to date, no one is with them except Shiv Sena and Akali Dal
 or punjab main akali dal ne bijepi kii chhichhaledar kar rakhi he
 Question (from Manish Tiwari): Will Aam Aadmi Party be the prepole partner of Congress or post poll? Manish Tiwari: We told the Aam Aadmi Party that you have a chance to fulfill your promises in Delhi
 mehara:magar ye hamen kaam nahin karne de rahe
 Talk on issues
 aap piem bhi chunate hai desh kaa, to chup chupakar karte hai
 Manish: The Aam Aadmi Party killed many things
 ab samay aa gaya jab aapako agitator se administrator bananaa hoga
 Now he got a chance to administer
 vah ho nahin rahaa, to bhaag rahe hai
 Say why you gave the letter to LG
 aap likhakar de dijie ki nahin chahie samarthan
 You say that stuck
 funs to aap log gaye hai
 Can't fulfill the promises mehara:manish ji aap to varisht mantri hai
 We are novices
 hamen kaam to karne dijie
 Jumma jumma has been 45 days
 note kariye manish ji
 i am telling 20 points
 agar aap kehete hai ki aam aadmi se judana araajaktaa he, to yahi sahi
 Sushil Modi: Referring to the Gujarat riots
 84 ke dange kyon bhul jate hai
 These Aam Aadmi Party and Congress people help each other and quarrel on TV
 hamane 7 saal nitish ji ke saath kaam kiya
 Never fights like this
 to ye log kyon sarkaar chalaa rahe hai
 If the Aam Aadmi Party has the courage, then resign in 24 hours
 mehara:bijepi kii manshaa saaf aa rahi he
 Five examples, how BJP is brother to Congress
 ye donon pro karpshan hai
 Jan Lokpal has been sitting for 45 years
 saamne mukhute hai, peeche ikatthe hai
 Second, all their leaders favor criminalization
 vuman rigerveshan ke mudde par ye log kundali maare baithe hai
 Question (from Rahul Mehra): Even you did not give fifty percent tickets
 bas apane samvidhan main shaamil kar liya
 Then argued that the right candidates could not be found
 yahi bijepi or congress kahati he
 Your minister Somnath Bharti is scamming
 bharti ne safai main kaha ki kisi ne mere naam kaa beja istemaal kiya
 He did not say that the allegations are false
 aam aadmi party ne andruni khap panchayat bulaai
 He decided that what he was saying was right
 kejariwal se poocha gaya
 Complan came against Ambani
 aapane exiaar darj kii
 But did nothing against Bharti
 jab patrakaron ne is par sawaal poochne kii koshish kii
 So you called 15 policemen and drove off
 mehara:bharti par aapane aarope lagaae
 They sent you a legal notice
 aam aadmi
 How far will the little man go? ediyaan ragad jaati hai, haq maangate maangate
 You spoke about Ambani
 54 hajaar ke salanaa naatak kaa bijepi congress ne pardaafash kyon nahin kiya
 You are spreading chaos
 aapkaa jimmedaar channel he
 Do not accuse like this
 sawaal (manish tiwari se): aapako kejariwal kii kathani kerani main fark lagata he?manish:main is baat main nahin padana chahta
 The people of Delhi will decide this
 aapke shrota ne 1984 ke dange kaa ahm sawaal uthaaya tha
 What happened in Delhi and the rest of the country is shameful and condemnable
 uskaa ek itihaas he
 The period of 1980-95 was
 jisamen lagbhag tees hajaar log aatankwaad kii aag main jalakar bhasma ho gaye
 My father was an MP
 unhen 3 april 1984 ko chandigarh main goli maar di gai thi
 There is hardly any family, which remains untouched
 bahut mushkil se hamane wo jakhm bhare
 We do not say that there should be no punishment
 magar ek vakt he, jab aapako aage badhanaa hoga
 Why question Gujarat? kyonki vahaan ke jo mukhyamantri hai
 Were even then
 unki taraf se ek shabd khed kaa, santvanaa kaa nahin nikalataa
 i am also asking for justice
 1984 main jin logon ne mere pita kaa katl kiya tha
 He was not prosecuted
 jahaan tak congress kii baat he
 Rightly said, Rahul Gandhi
 kuch naam aae the
 Action was taken on them
 maamla abhi bhi adaalat main vichaaradhin he
 Modi would have shed two false tears on Gujarat
 vaajapeyi ji ko jaakar kahana padaa ki rajdharm kaa paalan karen
 Sushil Modi: Talk of history
 us vakt narendra modi ko siem bane paanch maheene hue the
 Modi ji repeatedly said, it was unfortunate
 supreme court ne bhi clin chit de di
 Even after this they are repeatedly drawn
 modi ne lekh likhaa
 Interviewed and said that this is an unfortunate incident
 11 saal main gujarat main ek bhi danga nahin hua
 Question (from Manish Tiwari): This is not a big deal
 pehle lagaataar dange hote the
 Manish: You have to go to Gujarat for this
 main 2004-07 tak gujarat congress prabharee rahaa
 Which is a minority there
 vah itnaa saham gaya he
 Treated there with so much barbarity
 uske baad aap garv se kehete hai ki das saal main danga nahin hua
 The question that should have been asked was whether those with whom the vandalism took place in 2002 got justice
 ye kyon hua ki supreme court ko saare trial rajya ke baahar transfar karne pade
 The same Supreme Court held that the state was moving and Nero was playing the flute
 sawaal (susheel modi se): modi danga prabhavit ilaakon main ek baar bhi nahin gaye
 Humanity does not say that the healer should go once
 susheel modi:mujhe nahin lagata ki mulaayam singh yadav mujffarnagar danga peediton ke yahaan gaye yaa nahin gaye
 Whether or not Congress went to the house of the Sikh riot victims
 gujarat main musalmaan baaki mulk ke mukaable behatar he
 It is not possible for a chief minister to go to each house
 main is dibet main nahin janaa chahta
 i want to say that an unfortunate accident happened
 aap uske naam par kitne barason tak vot maangana chahenge
 Question (to Sushil Modi): If there is no riot in God or Khuda
 hajaar log mar jaaen
 What would you have done? Sushil Modi: We had a bomb exploded in a rally here
 modi ji gaye
 to meet them
 mahatvapurn milanaa nahin
 To make financial arrangements
 suraksha majboot karnaa he
 Manish Tiwari: You are the most senior
 aap ghar jaaen na jaaen
 But do not compare the people killed in the massacre to the puppy that comes under the car
 isse aapaki asamvedansheeltaa jhalkati he
 Sushil Modi: This is misleading
 unhone kaha tha ki ek kutta bhi mar jaataa he, to aadmi ko dukh hota he
 Many people died here
 rahul mehara:jab bhi baat chalati he, ye saare dangon kii
 He remembers an ad
 hamaara danga aapke dange se durbhagyapurna kaise
 There is a logic argument
 danga danga he
 Is a human being
 maut hai
 The state is managed
 thodaa sharam kar lijie
 Let the SIT go on Gujarat riots against BJP
 dilli dangon par aisa kyon nahin hua
 Manish Tiwari: Aam Aadmi Party is a classic example of ignorance and arrogance
 desh kaa loktantr kitna majboot he
 This shows the condition of minorities there

 Now the pulses of Mozambique in India, PM Modi said - what you want is that our party's constitution says that whoever will be the head of the party, he will also be the presidential candidate on their behalf
 aise main ramphosa ko party pramukh banane ke baad se juma par pad chhodane kaa dabaav badhata gaya
 However he did not resign immediately and remained in the post for nearly 2 months
 juma ne yah istipha tab diya jab unki party ke sheersh netritv ne unase pad chhodane yaa phir sansad main avishvaas prastaav kaa saamana karne main se kisi ek ko chunane kaa nirdesh diya
 The new President Ramaphosa is one of the senior leaders of the ruling party ANC and he was also the presidential candidate after Nelson Mandela, but managed to replace Tabo Embiki as President

 harprit singh or vijay kumaar ne rashtramandal khelon main ravivaar ko purushon kii vyaktigat 25 meter centre fire pistal nishanebaaji spardhaa main kramash: swarna or rajat padak jeeta
 Indian shooters continued their golden campaign with this, but women shooters Suma Shirur and Kavita Yadav failed to make it to the top three of the 10m air rifle singles at Karni Singh Shooting Range
 harprit ne 580 ke score ke saath maujuuda khelon kaa apana doosraa swarna jeeta
 Earlier, along with Vijay, he won the title of the pairs of this event

 Earlier there was confusion in the 25 meter range as to which shooter scored more points in the shoot off

 In such a situation, the defaulter mostly hits the wrong target and can then have both advantages and disadvantages to the shooter standing
 guistiniano ke baad khadey poh ne vijay ko rajat milane ke baad virodh kiya
 The Singapore shooter claimed to have scored a perfect 50 but the jury rejected it

 Debate on construction of Babri Masjid court on 14th day in Ayodhya casevikil PN Mishra said that Babri Masjid was not Babur, Aurangzeb made Banavamishra cited Baburnama, Tujukhe Jahangiri and Aayin Akbari Babri Masjid in Supreme Court during hearing of 14th day in Ayodhya case There was debate over the creation, time of making and the name of the creator
 sunwaayee ke dauraan shriram janmabhumi punarutthan samiti kii ore se varisht vakil pien mishra ne daleelein dete hue is baat kaa khandan kiya ki masjid babar ne banavaai
 He denied that Aurangzeb built the mosque by breaking the Ram temple
 kyonki 1770 se pehle jisane bhi ayodhya kii yatra kii usne vahaan masjid hone kaa koi zikr tak nahin kiya
 At the beginning of the hearing, PN Mishra read the excerpts from Babarnama saying that there are no historical documents suggesting that the disputed structure (babri Masjid) on the birthplace was built in 520 AD
 mishra ne babarnama yani babar kii rojnaamachaa diary kaa hawala dete hue kaha ki usamen mir baaki ke bare main zikr tak nahin he
 The rest of Baig is referring to Tashkandi and the rest of Baig
 baaki tashakandi 1529 main tashkand se (ayodhya) babar se milane aayaa tha
 Mishra argued that Aurangzeb had broken the temple, not Babur
 mir baaki jaisaa koi shaks tha hi nahin
 Justice Bobde asked- what does this have to do with you? Because the topic is how do you have the right to the birthplace? make it clear
 mishra ne kaha ki meraa daawa he, aurangzeb ne mandir todakar masjid banaai thi
 If the court accepts this claim, then the Sunni Waqf Board's claim proves to be completely false
 kyonki inke tark hi galat tathy par aadhaarit hai to phir inkaa jameen par daawa kaisaa!pien mishra ne teen kitabon babarnama, tujuke jahangiri or aaine akabari kaa hawala diya
 Mishra said that there is no talk of Babur building Babri Masjid in Mirror Akbari and Humayunama
 tujuke jahangiri main bhi babari masjid kaa naam tak nahin he
 Mishra said that our temple was demolished and a mosque was built
 ab vakf board yah sabit kare ki 100-200 saal se yahaan kab namaaj padhi gai? babar iskaa sirf waakif tha yani usne sirf jameen vakf kii
 Mishra also referred to the diary book of writer Trafan Thaler, who visited India in 1770, before the British era, in which Thaler mentioned the building there barely 30–40 years ago, which was then used for the Ayodhya Masjid Janmabhoomi
 Knew by name
 ayodhya ke nakshe main ram janmasthan or mandir kaa zikraus vakt kaa ayodhya kaa nakshaa bhi court ke saamne rakhaa gaya, jisamen ram janmasthan or mandir kaa ullekh saaf-saaf he
 The petitioner said that this map was created more than 200 years ago by an Englishman named Hans Baker, after matching and assessing the description given in Skanda Purana and the current situation in Ayodhya
 yani us samay banaae gaye nakshe main masjid kaa naam tak nahin he
 PN Mishra also cited Niccol मन Manucci's book
 nicolo italian tha or aurangzeb kii sena kaa kamandaar bhi tha
 Justice Bobde asked, was Aurangzeb's commander Italian? Mishra said that yes, Aurangzeb's commander was Italian
 aaine akabari kaa bhi zikr aayaa
 However, Mishra insisted that the process of breaking the temple and building a mosque took place in the era of Aurangzeb
 court ne unki daleelon ke samarthan main bhoomi rajasav ke pramaan bhi maange, jisase unka daawa or tark sabit ho sake
 The Zikramishra of the Babri Masjid from 1840 argued that around 1840 the British had deployed indigenous mulajim from Bengal to Awadh, who had arbitrarily entered (recorded) land revenue
 yani usee vakt se babari masjid naam kaa zikr he
 Not before that
 babarnama main bhi kahin babar ke ayodhya pravaas, kisi mandir ko tode jane yaa vahaan masjid banane kaa farmaan dene kaa koi zikr nahin he
 Mishra said that Mir Khan's name is sometimes found as a mosque builder
 iske baad humayunnama ke us daur ke hisse kaa bhi ullekh mishra ne court main kiya
 There is no discussion in it that Babur built the mosque
 mishra ne roosi paryatak kii kitaab ke hawaale se ye bhi kaha ki 1650 se pehle ramajanm sthaan ke paas do kabron kaa to zikr kitaab main aayaa he lekin masjid kaa nahin
 The 15th day of the hearing will also be a period of pleas of the committee, in which there will be documents of land revenue
 islamic raaj main teen tarah ke shashanpien mishra ne kaha ki islamic shashan main teen tarah ke shashan nihit hai, daarul islam, daarul harab, daarul aman
 Mishra said that in Darul Islam, a Muslim ruler can win over his property by fighting with another Muslim ruler, but his status does not change
 doosraa daarul harab he
 India is called Darul Harb, another ruler was asked to either accept Islam or apply jizya to people of other religions
 ayodhya main babar ek governor ke jariye raaj kar rahaa tha
 In Darul Aman, people of other religions are not made to fight and they were allowed to follow their religion
 ramajnmabhumi punaruddhar samiti kii daleel kul milakar ye rahi ki vivaadit imaarat banavaane vaala koun tha, is par andeh he
 There was no Babar commander named Mir Baqi
 3 gumbad vaali wo imaarat maszid nahin thi
 The type of things required in the mosque was not there
 jis imaarat ko sunni vakf board babar ke daur main bani babari masjid bataa rahaa he, darasal wo to aurangzeb ke daur main banaai gai

 divangat abhinetri shridevi (sridevi) ke abhinay se saji film 'mom' (mom) china main 22 march ko relies hogi
 According to a statement, 'zee Studios International' has launched the film in 40 regions including Poland, Russia, United Arab Emirates, USA and Singapore
 ab yah film china main relies kii ja rahi he
 Vibha Chopra, head of filmmaking, distribution and tribunal of Zee Studios International, said, "the legacy of an artist remains in the work she has left for us
" or 'mom' iskaa sarvshereshth udhaaharan he
 Wherever the film was released, it received much positive response everywhere
 is maarmik film ko ek or bazaar main le jane, unke behatar or vyapak uphaar ko prasaarit karne par hamen garv he
 "in the film directed by Ravi Udyavar, Sridevi played a mother who sets out to avenge her step-daughter
 unki sauteli beti kaa kirdaar pakistani abhinetri sajal ali ne nibhaayaa tha
 Sridevi was posthumously awarded the National Award for Best Actress for her role as the avenging mother
 boni kapur ne kaha, "'mom' aisi film he jo har kshetra main donon- maataaon or darshakon ko jodatii he
 This is Sridevi's final film and we aim to show this beautiful film and her most memorable final film to as many people as possible
 " 'english winglish' ke paanch saal baad shridevi ne 2017 main ravi udhyawar kii 'mom' main shandaar abhinay kiya tha
 He also did a minor role in 'zero', released last year
 abhinetri kaa pichley saal 24 farvari ko nidhan ho gaya tha
 The Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) acting president Pravin Togadia has suffered compensation for the rhetoric against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Bharatiya Janata Party as the defeat of his supported candidate
 shanivaar ko viechpi ke antarrashtriya adhyaksh pad ke chunaav main togadiya gut ke raghav reddy ko shikast mili or vishnu sadashivam kokeje viechpi ke nae adhyaksh nirvaachit ho gaye
 With this, Praveen Togadia's journey of 32 years old VHP came to an end
 ab sawaal ye he ki vihip adhyaksh ke chunaav main parrast hone ke baad praveen togadiya aglaa kadam kya uthaaenge?ye sawaal isliye he kyonki praveen togadiya pichley kuch vakt se modi sarkaar ke khilaaf aawaaj buland kar rahe hai
 For the first time in 52 years, Togadia's rebellion was also the reason for the election of VHP President
 chunaav haar jane ke baad ab mana ja rahaa he ki togadiya apane virodh ke swar or buland kar sakate hai
 Togadia has given such hints of the movement given just before the election on Saturday (april 14)
 ek nijee channel ko die intervyuu main jab togadiya se poocha gaya ki chunaav haarane ke baad wo kya karenge, tab unhone ram mandir, kashmiri hindu, rojgaar or kisaanon ke muddon kaa zikr karte hue jawaab diya ki in sabhi muddon par modi sarkaar pichley chaar saalon main vifal rahi he
 Will support Modi in 2019? On the question whether Togadia will support Modi and BJP in the 2019 general election, he said that it is for Modi ji to decide
 togadiya kaa kahana he ki agar ram mandir jaise muddon par hamaari maang puri nahin kii jaati he, to vah modi kaa saath nahin denge
 He has said that in such a situation, he will work to win the system that fulfills the wishes of the people
 ram mandir par modi sarkaar se naarajadarasal, 2017 main adhyaksh pad kaa kaarykaal samaapt hone ke baad se hi praveen togadiya naaraaz chal rahe hai
 In January this year, he met in an unconscious state in Ahmedabad, after which he accused himself of threatening his life, crying in front of the media
 togadiya lagaataar ram mandir ke mudde par bhi modi sarkaar ko gher rahe hai
 Togadia has alleged that BJP, after securing majority in Parliament, overturned its Palampur proposal of 1989 to enact a law to build a grand Ram temple in Ayodhya
 ab viechpi se bedakhal hone ke baad togadiya hinduon se ekajute hone kaa aahvaan kar rahe hai
 He is talking of uniting Hindus for the construction of Ram temple by bringing legislation in Parliament
 jiske liye 17 april se unhone ahmedabad main anischitkaaleen anshan par jane kaa elaan kiya he
 Togadia alleges that neither there has been any development in the last four years nor the government has constructed the Neram temple
 wo aarope laga rahe hai ki sarkaar har morche par fail hui he
 In such a situation, Praveen Togadia, who has been spewing anti-incumbency against the Modi government, can create a crisis for BJP and Modi government after losing the election of VHP
 haalanki, sawaal ye bhi he ki centre main modi sarkaar aane se pehle hinduon kii aawaaj maane jane vaale togadiya ab vihip ke bina kya desh ke hinduon ko ekajute kar paane main safal ho paaenge? Central Board of Secondary Education has changed the rules regarding Joint Entrance Examination
 nae niyamon ke anusaar pariksha main bhaag lene vaale diabetes marijon ko khaas chhot di gai he
 According to the board's guidelines, students suffering from diabetes can bring fruits, sugar and water to the exam room during the JEE 2018 exam
 bataa den ki sibiesai jeii pariksha kaa aayojan karata he
 Diabetes patients can bring bananas, apples and oranges with them
 haalanki unhen packed food yaa chocolate, candi vagairah laane kii manaahi hogi
 Recently, CBSE also implemented these rules for students suffering from diabetes in board exam

 is twit main pi chidambaram ne kaha ki mere parivaar ne mere mitron, party sahyogiyon or shubhachintakon kii taraf se mujh tak shubhakamanaayen pahunchaai hai
 i was reminded that i was 74 years old

 Thank you everyone for encouraging me

 This is not just a date
 yah din he mahilaon ke naritv ke jashn, unke haq-hukuk or sammaan kii baat karne kaa, jise aaj puraa vishwa ‘antarrashtriya mahila diwas’ ke rup main manaa rahaa he
 Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Independence Day that the women of the country are walking shoulder to shoulder in the creation of a powerful India
 hamaari maa-bahanon kaa garv, unka yogadan, unka samarthy aaj desh anubhav kar rahaa he
 Today, women are contributing to the development of the country in every field
 aaj mahila diwas ke maukey par ham modi sarkaar ke un yojanaon or faislon kii baat karenge, jinase mahilaon kii jindagi badalane kaa kaam kiya
 1- Ujjwala Scheme 6 under Ujjwala Scheme in Modi Govt
 4 karod (1 farvari 2019 tak) LPG conection baante gaye
 Under this scheme, financial assistance of Rs 1600 was given to every woman for every gas connection
 ek conection main silendar, regulator or pipe shaamil he
 During the launch of the scheme, Prime Minister Modi said that he wants to protect women from the smoke emanating from the wood stove
 2- sukanya samruddhi yojana15 janvari, 2015 ko haryana ke panipat main piem modi ne sukanya samruddhi khaataa kaarykram kii shuruyaat kii
 The aim was to provide social security to the daughters
 yojana ke tahat 1 farvari 2019 tak 1
 52 crore accounts have been opened
 in khaaton main 25,979
 60 crores was deposited in the name of girls
 bataa den ki yah yojana 10 saal se kam umr kii bacchee ke liye he
 The money deposited in SSY fetches more interest than other savings schemes
 3- shauchalay nirmanbharat main ek bada tabaka aisa tha, jinke yahaan shauchalay nahin the
 9 in 2014-19 under Swachh Bharat Mission till 1 February 2019
 74 karod shauchalay banaae hai
 After this, currently more than 90 percent of Indians are able to use the toilet, while in 2014 less than 40 percent people were using the toilet
 ghar main shauchalay kaa naa hona mahilaon ke liye kshtdaayi tha, unhen nity-kriya ke liye ghar se baahar janaa padataa tha
 This scheme of Modi government changed the standard of living of women
 4- teen talaak bilamuslim mahilaon ke liye teen talaak kisi abhishaap se kam nahin tha
 The Modi government introduced the triple divorce bill during his tenure
 yah bill loksabhaa main paas ho chukaa he, lekin rajyasabha se paarit hona baaki he
 But the government has brought the bill into ordinance, which provides for a sentence of 3 years for granting triple talaq
 5- materenity livkamkaaji mahilaon ke maa banane par milane vaali chhuttiyon ko modi sarkaar ne badhaakar 26 saptaah kiya

 88 lakh women took advantage of paid maternity leave
 6- anya ahm yojanaayenin yojanaon ke alaava mudra or standap india se bhi kareeb 9 karod log labhanvit hue, jisamen mahilaon kii bhi acchhee khaasi sankhya he
 Not only this, the participation of women in the government is also increasing

 com / n08uosrvma basapa mukhiya mayawati ne bhale hi puri tarah se gathbandhan na todane kii baat kahi, magar ab samaajawaadee party ne tay kar liya he ki vah 2022 kaa vidhansabha chunaav akele ladegi
 This is said by Samajwadi Party sources
 sapa ke rashtriya adhyaksh akhilesh yadav ne party padaadhikariyon or kaaryakartaaon se beete dinon hui ek baithak main vidhansabha chunaav ke liye abhi se jute jane ko kaha he
 New committees are set up from the city to the village to prepare for the party
 darasal, 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav ke baad 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bhi karaari haar ke baad ab samaajawaadee party ke saamne 2022 ke vidhansabha chunaav main astitv bachaae rakhane kii chunauti he
 At the same time, Akhilesh Yadav also has a challenge to prove his leadership ability
 akele dam par sarkaar banaaegi sapaajatak dot in se baatcheet main samaajawaadee party ke rashtriya pravaktaa ypi singh kehete hai ki unki party kisi jati-majahab kii raajnneeti kii jagah sarvasamaj kii baat karti he
 In the 2022 assembly elections, the party will show itself forming the government on its own
 nateezon ke sawaal par singh kaa kahana he ki unki party bilkul hataash nahin he
 Party president Akhilesh Yadav has been spreading enthusiasm among the workers by touring continuously since the election results
 lachar kanoon-vyavastha se peedit pariwaron se mulaakaaten kar rahe hai
 Akhilesh Yadav is vocal on the frequent killings in the state
 haal main party adhyaksh akhilesh ne rajyapal se bhi milakar unase kanoon-vyavastha par bolne kii apil kar chuke hai
 Yadavs do not like bsp's support On June 4, BSP chief Mayawati had announced a press conference to fight the by-election alone, saying that sp's vote was not shifting
 isi ke saath gathbandhan ke bhavishya par sawalia nishaan lag gaye
 Mayawati had imposed the conditions and said that the alliance will continue only if Akhilesh brings some changes in the party
 press conference ke dauraan unhone samaajawaadee party ke kor voter 'yadavon' par bhitarghaat karne kaa aarope lagaate hue kaha tha ki unka puraa vot gathbandhan ko nahin mila
 Sources in the Samajwadi Party say that there is a lot of resentment among the Yadav class due to the boiling of the coalition failing
 ve ise apane liye apmanjanak maanate hai
 The Yadav society, which voted for the SP in wholesale terms, does not want to see any alliance with the BSP in any future
 sapa ke khantee samarthak yadavon kaa kahana he ki unke hi vot kii badaulat basapa shunya se das siton tak pahunchi, phir bhi tohamat lag rahi ki yadavon ne vot nahin diya
 When there is such a crisis of faith, why should the Samajwadi Party not fight alone
 sutara bataate hai ki apane kor voters ke bich se mili feedback ke baad akhilesh yadav ne akele chunaav ladane kaa faisla kiya he
 Earlier, after Mayawati's statements, Akhilesh Yadav has given indications to contest the election alone
 jamini gatividhiyaan badhayenge akhileshsutra bataate hai ki vidhansabha or loksabhaa chunaav main sapa kii haar ke peeche jameen par kam sakriyata bhi pramukh vajah rahi
 The Samajwadi Party movement was in the mood before the 2012 assembly elections
 puure pradesh me banpar paimaane par cycle yatraaen nikaalkar maahaul party netaa maahaul banaate the
 The party did not show much aggression in the 2017 assembly elections nor in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 akhilesh ghar kaa jhagada hi thik karne main jute rahe
 He could not even set the board properly to fight outside
 bijepi kii aakraamak campaning kaa makul jawaab akhilesh ke paas nahin rahaa
 The result was a drastic defeat of the party in both elections
 vidhansabha chunaav main congress ke saath to loksabhaa chunaav main basapa ke saath gathbandhan fail ho gaya
 In such a situation, the party sources are saying that by contesting the elections alone, the Samajwadi Party will get an opportunity to contest all the assembly seats
 jisase party ke kaaryakarta bhi utsahit honge
 At the same time, there will not be that danger in the case of coalition that someone can increase their own numbers by using your workers and resources
 aise main samaajawaadee party vidhansabha chunaav tak lagaataar ection mod main rahane kii taiyaari main he
 Home Minister Rajnath Singh is visiting Uttarakhand

 Priyanka Gandhi Vadra's visit to Lucknow is seen in many ways as a game changer for the Congress or as a solution to many problems
 teen dinon ke apane lakhanu pravaas ke dauraan priyanka ne din raat baithken karke kareeb chaar hajaar congress kaaryakartaaon se mulaakaat kii
 If Uttar Pradesh Congress President Raj Babbar believes, Priyanka has met four thousand workers from Eastern Uttar Pradesh and has prepared a roadmap for these eels and she has a strategy that will make the Congress alive again in these ellipses
 Can
 congressi ye maanate he ki 2009 main congress ko 21 jagahon par safalataa mili thi to phir use 2019 main kyon nahin doharaaya ja saktaa he
 Congressmen are also saying that meeting Priyanka with four thousand workers means meeting at least 10 to 15 activists from every assembly constituency in eastern Uttar Pradesh, listening to them and getting feedback
 yadi in jaankariyon or soochnaaon ko achche se ikattha kiya jaae to ek aisa pulinda taiyaar kiya ja saktaa he jo priyanka ke liye ek guide book kii tarah kaam karegaa
 It was not that those who had reached Lucknow to meet Priyanka were only mlas or former mlas or mps or corporators
 ji nahin, lakhanu main hamen dheron yuva to dikhe hi magar aise log bhi hamen mili jo indira gandhi or rajeev gandhi ke samay ke the magar pichley ek dashak se ghar baith gaye the maayoos ho kar ki ab is party kaa kuch nahin ho saktaa
 But Priyanka's visit has created a hope in her that she is also realizing that her time will also come
 kai bujurgon ne hamase kaha ki 'bitiyaa ne bulin hai isliye aae hai'
 Therefore, there was definitely an enthusiasm among them that someone is listening to me
 yahi vajah he ki lakhanu ke priyanka ke road sho main jo bheed umadi thi, usne lakhanu ko paat diya he
 Workers from all over Uttar Pradesh were involved, not only in Lucknow
 magar vahaan aae log yah bhi kah rahe the ki keval is ek meeting se kuch nahin hoga priyanka ko ab lakhanu main baithna padegaa
 It is to be hoped that Priyanka will also realize this
 magar yadi priyanka kuch thaan len to congress yahaan kuch kar sakati he kyonki yahi wo kshetra he jahaan se 2009 main congress ko sabase zyada safalataa mili thi
 In these areas, the vote or say supporter of Congress is present
 magar vah ghar baitha he
 Just think, in 2014, in a place like Banaras, the Congress candidate had received around lakh votes against Prime Minister Modi, while Arvind Kejriwal was also in the role of a voter
 yahi nahin purvi uttarapradesh kaa yah ilaaka sarvanon khaskar brahman or bhoomiharon ke dabadabaa vaala janaa jaataa he
 At the same time, the Muslim population is also in large numbers and the strategy of the Congress will also be to convert them into their votes because till two decades ago they were with the Congress and after the rise of the BSP, the Dalits separated from them
 babari cond ke baad muslim unase chhitak gaya magar ab priyanka ke saamne chunauti he ki inhen kaise congress ke paale main laayaa jaae
 Priyanka has an appeal and an art of connecting with people
 magar raajnneeti main isse bahut kuch adhik chahie hota he
 Priyanka will have to make the Congress stand in every village, town, city and districts because its organization has disappeared in the last two decades
 jab tak har booth par congress kaa kaaryakarta nahin hoga, tab tak purvi uttarapradesh main congress ko safalataa milanaa ek sapane se kam nahin he
 But what to say to the Congressmen who have been saying since Priyanka's arrival that their day will also come

 is dauraan bharat ne china se vyapaarik or kootnithik rishte to saadhe hi, pakistan ko bhi kadaa sandesh diya
 Giving information about President Xi Jinping's visit to India, Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale said that issues like trade, investment, Mansarovar Yatra, tourism were discussed between the two heads of state
 lekin is dauraan kashmir mudde par koi charchaa nahin hui
 Foreign Secretary said that India has already said that Kashmir is the internal issue of India and no interference in it is acceptable to India
 bataa den ki jammu-kashmir se anuchhed-370 hatane ke baad china kuch maukon par pakistan ke samarthan main bayaan diya tha
 Then China had said that India should not disturb the status quo of Jammu and Kashmir
 pakistan jab is mudde par UN gaya to vahaan bhi use china kaa samarthan mila tha

 Everything becomes clear only after seeing them
 parde kii ye hit jodi, asal jindagi main bhi kuch kam nahin he
 Deepika is the beat of young hearts but if we talk about Ranvir Singh, then every girl wants a boyfriend like her
 unamem lagbhag har wo baat he jisaki ek ladki apane saathi main ummid rakhti he
 They know how to live together, know how to be happy, know how to share sorrow and respect

 Neither our relationship nor my feelings

 bahut se aise log hote hai jinhen dusron kii kamyaabi or khushi raas nahin aati
 In some cases people even object to their partner's success, but Ranveer is different
 wo deepika kii kamyaabi kaa jashn bhiusi tarah manaate hai, jaise wo unki hi safalataa ho

 It was Ranveer who was also standing with her at that time

 har ladki kii ye khwaahish hoti he ki uskaa partner usase to pyaar kare hi lekin uske gharavaalon ko bhi puri izzat de
 Ranveer is like this
 wo aksar deepika ke mummy-papa se milte hai or unka haal-chaal lete rahete hai

 jindadil log har kisi ko pasand hote hai or ranvir singh se zyada live, fan-luving star aapane shaayad hi doosraa dekha ho

 haalanki vah life saport par nahin he
 i don't know what medical terms we should use for them
 mukhyamantri karyaalay ne kaha he ki haalat sthit he, isliye ham yahi maanakar chal rahe hai

 Are there drought conditions in the country? Is there going to be a terrible crisis of food items in the country? If we follow the current indications, then this feeling is felt because the way the prices of food and drink are going up in the country
 jharkhand or manipur ke kai jile suukhaagrast ghoshitmonsoon kamjor padataa ja rahaa he, manipur or jharkhand ke kain jile sookhaa prabhavit ghoshit kar die gaye hai
 Farmers are still waiting for good rains in Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, the situation is not better in Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan
 is sabase lag rahaa he ki bazaar ko is saal kamjor monsoon ke baad koi ummid nahin bachi he, kheton main kaam karne vaale kisaan pareshaan hai, agle saal kii fasalon kaa intjaam kahaan se hoga
 Seeds are becoming bad The government says that the grain reserves are full in the country for more than a year
 lekin mushkil ye nahin he, mushkil to is saal kisaanon or madhya varg kii he
 If the monsoon is weak then the farmer will not have any means of earning this year because in the hope of monsoon, farmers in large areas of the country made preparations for sowing, but without rain, those seeds are also starting to deteriorate
 kisaan kii fasal kam hui yaa kharaab hui to uske liye bhi sankat khadaa ho jayega
 In such a situation, if food crisis also arises, then the prices of everyday things in the market will go on touching the sky, due to which neither middle class nor upper middle class will be able to survive
 al nino kaa he prabhaavadarasal ye halaat paidaa hua monsoon main kamajori se
 By this time, it rains heavily in the entire country, but this time people in North India, West and Eastern states have been experiencing rains
 ekaadh din acchhee barsaat ko chhodkar is baar indra devtaa ne bharat par meharbaani dikhaai hi nahin
 The worst monsoon cry for water is in Uttar Pradesh, where this time the rainfall has reduced by 76%
 punjab ke khet bhi is baar pyaase rah gaye hai, jahaan 69 fisadi kam barsaat hui he
 Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh too have received 66 per cent less rainfall than the average so far
 haryana or dilli main barish main kareeb 57 fisadi kami darj kii gai he
 That is, if we look at the whole of North India, it received 46 percent less rainfall than the average
 madhya bharat, jisamen madhyapradesh, gujarat ke alaava maharashtra urisa jaise rajya hai, vahaan bhi 44 fisadi barish kam hui he
 Rains have also fallen by about 35 per cent in the eastern parts
 dakshin bharat main 21 fisadi barish kam hui he
 The power crisis is also deepening, the monsoon is seen to be weakening across the country, as a result of this, it is also affecting the electricity reaching the cities of the country
 nateeja udyogon ko apane utpaadan main naa chaahate hue bhi kahin kahin katautee kerani padi he
 The reason is that there is no supply of electricity, because the dams on which electricity is produced, the level of water is decreasing day by day
 aakhir aisa kyon ho rahaa he, monsoon is baar kamjor kyon padaa he
 Experts consider El Nino a big reason for this
 al nino duniya bhar ke mausam main badlaav kii vajah se banataa he
 Usually it is made every four years, but when and how much difference it makes, it is decided by the strength of El Nino
 kya he al ninoie jaraa samajhen ki ye al nino he kya
 When the temperature of winds on the surface of the Pacific Ocean rises above normal, the speed of winds flowing from South American countries towards Asia changes, resulting in a weak monsoon in Asia and Australia
 australian mausam vibhaag ne bhi al nino kii ashanka jataai he
 This means that rain will reduce in many countries of Asia and Australia including India, and this part of the world will be forced to face El Nino in this era of recession

 Let me tell you that earlier, BJP candidate from Bhopal Lok Sabha seat, Sadhvi Pragya Thakur, gave a controversial statement against Hemant Karkare, who was killed in the 26 / 11 Mumbai attack

 Pragya Thakur said that an officer had asked Hemant Karkare to release him, but Karkare had said that he would do anything, bring evidence but not leave Sadhvi
 sadhvi pragna thakur ne kaha tha ki hemanth karkare kaa ye qadam deshadroh tha, dharmaviruddh tha
 Sadhvi said, "it was his wretchedness
 It was treason, he was unconcerned, he used to ask me if i had to go to God for the truth, then i said you need to go"
 sabha main sadhvi ne kaha, ''maine use kaha tha tera sarvanaash hoga, usne mujhe gaaliyaan di thim

 bangaleru main ek press conference main saurav ne vibhinn muddon par apni raay vyakt kii, lekin aakhri main unhone sidhe shabdon main kaha ki wo ab sanyas lenaa chaahate hai
 Sourav told a lot of things in an exclusive interview given to him today
 uske ansh:itnaa bada faisla lene se pehle kya aapane sochaa tha?haa bilkul sochaa tha
 Such big decisions are not taken suddenly
 jab se main irani trophy se baahar hua tabhi se maine soch liya tha ki ab ritairement kaa samay aa gaya he
 i am lucky that i got a chance to play a series between India and Australia
 agar meraa pradarshan acha rahata to main or bhi siries khel saktaa tha, lekin mujhe lagata he ki ritairement lene kaa yahi sahi samay he
 You said earlier that you can play more cricket, how did you suddenly take this decision? i had said these things in an interview about eight-nine months ago, but then the situation was different and now the situation is different
 kya yah faisla aapane baari man se liya he?pichley teraa-chaudaa saal se cricket khel rahaa hum
 It is sad when you are separated from something you love, but it is surprising that i have not felt bad since i announced my retirement
 aapane is bare main apane parivaaravaalon va doston se baat kii thi?jab se main drop hua, tab se hi yah baat maine apane pitaaji se kii thi, lekin ve ise maanane ko taiyaar nahin he
 However, two or three of my close friends accepted my decision as absolutely correct
 bisisiai kii taraf se viares skim kii baat kahi ja rahi thi
 The BCCI said that the players should decide the time of their departure
 kya aisa kuch he?nahin, aisa kuch nahin he
 Nor will anything ever happen
 senior khiladiyon ne bharat ke liye bees-bees hajaar ran banaae hai
 Sachin, Dravid, Laxman and Anil are very big players
 aise khilaadi bharat main bahut kam aae hai
 All these will go back on their own terms
 beshak, srilanka daure main ye bahut kuch na kar paaen hon lekin aane vaali siries main ye jarur kuch kamaal dikhaaenge
 There is much to be done by them
 kya aapke is faisle se khiladiyon ko aashcharya hua?haa, kyonki siries main aane ke baad hi maine yah faisla liya
 But the players also suspected this somewhere
 unhen lag rahaa tha ki agar abhi aisa nahin hua to nikat bhavishya main meri sanyas lene kii sambhaavna he
 What should we expect from Sourav Ganguly in this series and in the coming time? Now all the pressure has come off my shoulders
 is siries main behatar pradarshan karunga or bhavishya main jindagi kaa anand uthaaunga
 Sourav, you know that about twenty years ago Sunil Gavaskar was the player who said that now my time has come and i am retiring
 shaayad iske baad koi bhartiya khilaadi nahin he, jinhone khud apana vakt chunaa ho?dekhie, jaisaa ki maine kaha ki yah faisla lenaa aasaan nahin he
 Anyway, except Sachin and Dravid, there are no players to play hundred matches and when pressure is put on someone, they take such decisions
 aane vaale dinon main sachin, dravid or kumble apni sharton par sanyas lenge kyonki unamem itani kaabiliyat he ki wo jab tak khelenge tab tak behatar pradarshan karenge
 Anyway, except Kapil and Gavaskar, there have not been so many big players who get a chance to do so
 bhartiya cricket ke samarthak aapako kis cheez ke liye yaad rakhen?ye to vahi log tay karenge ki kis cheez ke liye yaad kiya jaae, lekin itnaa jarur kahana chaahunga ki akele maine nahin balki ham paanchon ne bhartiya cricket ke chehre ko badal kar rakh diya
 Before 2000, whenever the Indian team used to go for a foreign tour, people used to say that they come only to lose
 iske thik ulat ham paanchon ne bhartiya cricket team ko kai mahatvapurn jeet dilaain
 Life after cricket and waking up in the morning ready for newspaper and tea? i am ready for newspaper and tea
 yahi sochakar khush hum ki subah saat baje uthakar running ke liye nahin janaa padegaa
 Come on, Sourav congratulates you a lot and you have yet to give a gift to the cricket supporters in the upcoming series

 a temple is being built at Patparganj in the capital Delhi
 baat itani si hoti to na to likhane kii jarurat hi nahin padati, kyonki deshbhar main mandir to banate hi rahete he
 But this temple is being built on government land
 har jagah zyaadaatar jagahon par mandir yaa phir masjid sarkari jameen par hi banate najar aate hai
 Some people are in favor and in some opposition the voices of those who oppose are often ignored
 mudde kii baat to ye he ki patpadganj ke plot number 44 ke paas kripal socity ke log us jameen par mandir bana rahe he jo unki he hi nahin
 However, he claims that he owns the land and can do whatever he wants on it
 magar ise lekar sosayadi ke baahar ke log is ashanka main satark ho gaye hai ki kahin avaidh rup se ban rahaa yah mandir tanaav kaa kaaran na ban jaae
 For the last few days, this temple has suddenly started being built on the government land adjacent to the Kripal Society
 jab purvi dilli ke patpadganj kii is sosayadi main ham pahunche to kai tarah ke sawaal hameen se puche jane lage ki hamen kisne bataaya ki yahaan koi mandir ban rahaa he
 They say that there was an old temple here and they are rebuilding it
 ve is baat se bhi inkaar kar rahe the ki yah didie yani dilli vikaas praadhikaran kii jameen he
 They said that the land is in their custody for thirty years and then the DDA did not raise any voice on it and now we should do whatever we want
 log hamase yahaan tak kah rahe the ki aap yahaan aa kaise gaye or kisase puch kar aae
 At present, there is only one way to reach here, which goes through the Society's gate
 baad main pataa chalaa ki yahaan tak pahunchane kaa ek or rasta tha, jise sosayadi waalon ne band karvaa diya
 When we met people outside the society, they said that this land is official
 kripal socity ne galat tareeke se is par kabja kar rakhaa he
 These people do not mind the construction of the temple
 sarkari zamin par kabze ko lekar shikaayat he
 Also why the Society stopped the way to come here
 is sambandh main jab didie ke adhikariyon se baat kii gai to unhone bhi mana ki sarkari jameen par gaiyrkanoonee dhang se mandir ban rahaa he or iskaa nirmaan rukvane ke liye dilli police se shikaayat bhi kii gai he, lekin abhi tak koi thos karrwai nahi hui dikhti he
 At the same time, the police argue that she has started preventing the riots in Trilokpuri, she will see it later
 is bich mandir kaa nirmaan kaary jor shor se chal rahaa he
 There is also a slum in the adjacent area, where people from every community live
 logon se baatcheet main waisi kahaniyaan saamne ain jo aksar tanaavon ke vakt khuraaq ban jaati hai
 As a reporter, i felt that the tension in Trilokpuri or other states in Delhi started from a small point and later when the fire broke out it became very difficult to control it
 vaise ye jagah trilokapuri se mahaj dedh do kilometre par he or chingaari failane main vakt nahin lagata
 Last year, while prohibiting the construction of religious sites on the roads, the Supreme Court said that public roads are not the property of anyone
 har kisi ko sadak se guzarane kaa haq he or ise koi mandir, masjid, carch yaa gurudwara banaakar yaa kisi badi shakhsiyat kii pratimaa banaakar roka yaa baadhit nahin kiya ja saktaa
 In 2008, Narendra Modi, the current Prime Minister and then Chief Minister of Gujarat, had removed 90 such religious places, mostly temples, in Ahmedabad
 sawaal he kya unki sarkaar dilli main bhi sadak yaa sarkari jagahon par banane vaale dharmik sthalon par roak lagaaegi
 Students who climb the ladder of rapid development are forced to study in a government toilet in a government college in Gurgaon
 new railway road par sthit dronacharya government college main classroom kii kami ke chalate pichley do saal se toilet ko hi asthai classroom bana diya gaya he
 Classes of MA sociology run in the college toilet
 is par college ke principal aarake yadav kaa kahana he ki unke paas sarkari fund kii kami he ar is vajah se ve class nahin banavaa paa rahe hai
 According to him, 'we need at least 25 classrooms
 pichley saal sarkaar ne 12 classroom banavaane kii manjuuri di thi, lekin nirmaan kaary ke liye fund abhi tak nahin mila he
 'at the same time, the student says that sitting in the toilet of a new arts block is disgraceful, but it is better to sit in the sun
 unka kahana he ki college prashasan ne pichley saal unase kaha tha ki ek saal ke andar-andar nae classroom bana die jaaenge, lekin abhi tak kuch nahin hua he
 Not only this, the students are also disturbed by the smell coming from the toilet during the class
 haalanki toilet kii rojna safai kii jaati he, lekin phir bhi koi raahat nahin milti
 He is also sad that other college students tease him because of studying in the toilet

 After Ashwin's over, additional players brought a shin guard for Rahane and then Dhoni again put on the pad

 kaamanwealth games ke aayojan se pehle kaa maahaul bhale hi kaaphi tanaav bharaa rahaa ho, par jis kisi ne bhi in khelon ko dekha, vah ise behtareen hi qaraar degaa
 It has emerged as a concrete proof of the power of the people and the aliveness of Indian democracy
 bharat bhushan ko likhen
 International media called the opening ceremony of the Commonwealth Games grand
 samaapan samaaroh bhi behad dilachasp va manabhaavan tehraaya jayega
 In this way, the hearty desire of the countrymen seems to be fulfilled
 hamane dekha ki bharat ab paramparaagat khelon ke daayre se kaaphi aage nikal chukaa he
 Especially when we look at success in track and field, gymnastics and swimming
 chote shaharon or gaanvon se aanevaale khiladiyon kii safalataa ne bharat kaa damakham jaahir kar diya he
 It has shown that sports can prove effective in maintaining harmony in the country
 desh kii mahila khiladiyon ne badi sankhya main padak jitkar hamen gauravanvit hone kaa avasar diya he
 Many of them look after their families and children, as well as undergo rigorous training
 desh main ab nae khel sitaron kaa udai ho chukaa he
 It is hoped that these players will be an inspiration for many people in villages, cities and towns
 khelon ke aayojan ke dauraan dilli nagar ne bhi bahut kuch paaya he
 Delhi has got a new airport terminal
 metro kaa network puure rashtriya rajdhani kshetra main fail chukaa he, vah bhi niyat samay-seemaa ke bheetar
 Delhi suddenly found new roads, improved footpaths, flyovers and underpasses
 rajdhani main saarvajanik yatayaat pranali main kaaphi sudhaar ho chukaa he
 New low-floor buses have also started plying at the time of the Games
 saath hi waisi 2,000 vaataanukoolit basen bhi kafile main shaamil ho chuki hai, jo khiladiyon or adhikariyon ko laane-le jane main shaamil thim
 Nearly all the stadiums have been rebuilt or renovated, which are now pride for the NCR
 dilli main ab khiladiyon ke liye behtareen chikitsa centre khul chukaa he
 Superb infrastructure for the Games has been prepared with complete planning
 saarvajanik or nijee kshetra ke sahyog se in yojanaon ko amalijama pahanaaya gaya or khelon kii sari suvidhaayen muhaiyaa karai gayi
 Thousands of school children, who watched the games carefully on the stadium or on their TV sets, will also be inspired to make their move to the games
 baad main yahi bachche apane skool ke madhyam se yaa apane prayaason se in suvidhaon kaa laabh paa sakenge
 The holding of the Commonwealth Games has also highlighted the improved efficiency of institutions responsible for civic amenities
 inhone dikhaa diya ki safai kaa kya matlab hota he or milijule prayaas se kya kuch hasil kiya ja saktaa he
 Our traffic police too has now realized that a challan-cutting scheme cannot improve traffic arrangements
 sadak par trephic police kii maujuudagi zyada ahmiyat rakhti he
 The Delhi Police has also learned to be correct, polite by exception
 'duniya hamen dekhakar kya kahegi', is bhay ne bhi hamen jimmedaariyon kaa kaaphi ehsaas karaayaa
 Will it all be over after the conclusion of the Games? The hope is that we will be able to keep it alive in times to come
 kaamanwealth games ke dauraan hamane duniya ke saamne jo namr or atithi satkar main nipun hone kii chhavi pesh kii he, vah aage bhi barkaraar rakhane main ham sakasham hai
 Despite all this, one should not forget that many negative things are also associated with the organization of the Games
 niyantrak or mahalekhapareekshak karyaalay, pravartan nideshaalay, or kendriya jaanch beuro ko gadbadiyon kii jaanch kii ijaajat jarur milani chahie
 Accountability should also be fixed for these disturbances
 vyavastha main pehle se hi vaise tatv maujuud hai, jo ek-duusare par dosha madhne main maahir hai
 It should not only happen that some bureaucrats should be made scapegoats
 jaanch kaa uddeshy aisa hona chahie, jisase saarvajanik sansthaaen or inke pramukh ko zyada javabdeh banaaya ja sake

 He was one of the youngest editor-turned-journalists of his time
 print or electronic media se jude jin logon ne unhen nahin dekha, unke liye bhi vah ek khaasaa janaa-pahachaanaa naam hai
 a journalist-editor who worked with him in the book The Real Mediaman, published on him, wrote, The pair of Surendra Pratap Singh and MJ Akbar increased the credibility of the youth for the first time in the history of journalism
 ravivaar or sande ne hi khoji patrakarita kii neenv daali
 For the first time, the reports of journalists writing in Hindi were not only published in English, but there was uproar
 pehali baar ek ghatana ko paanch-paanch patrakaron ne ek saath cover kiya
 This was the period when the incident happened, the daily newspapers used to print it, but people used to wait for Sunday and Sunday
 hawa main tairti ghatnaon ko soonghnaa or unhen badi report main tabdeel kar dena espi kaa adbhut gun tha
 While being the editor of 'aaj Tak' program aired on Doordarshan, SP Singh kept telling the reality despite government censorship, then later it was difficult for any editor to appear on the TV screen
 isaki apni vajahen ho sakati hai
 The impact of technology, changing society, raging politics and capital on journalism

 Surendra Pratap Singh, the editor behind the Sunday magazine, remembered for his stamina
 dinmaan kii vichaar patrakarita ko ravivaar ne khoji patrakarita or spot reporting se nayaa vistaar diya
 It was his style of journalism to accurately assess the impact of political-social movements and to openly disclose it in simple, understandable language
 ek puure daur main paakhand or aadambar se aage kii patrakarita espi ke netritv main hi saakaar ho rahi thi
 Perhaps this is why he gained unprecedented popularity and it can be said that SP Singh was the first superstar of journalism
 espi singh apane lekhan se sampradayik, pongapathi, jativaadee or abhijan shaktiyon ko lagaataar asahaj karte rahe
 The writing of this Khanty journalist with a fine political understanding and forward thinking is still contemporary

 While doing this, a questionnaire was sent to several journalists, including Surendra Pratap Singh
 prashn is tarah the-swatantraaa andolan kii patrakarita kaa swar jitna angreji samrajyavad ke viruddh he,utana varna vyavastha,jati pratha ke prati kyon nahin?hindi patrakarita par hindu patrakarita kaa aarope kahaan tak sahi he?kya mandir-mandal andolan ke mudde par patrakarita tatasth or nishpaksh rah pai?akhabaaron kii kaaryshaalaaon or prashikshan sansthaanon main daliton kii loktantric bhagidaari kyon nahin he?is varg main kya pratibha kaa sankat he?sampadak ke naate aapane dalit vishyak prashnon ko kis rup main liya?dalit sahitya kii koi bhi vidha gaiyr dalit akhabaaron main kyon nahin chap rahi he,ityadi
 Those who sat at the top of journalism came from that caste, class which did not accept the equal existence of backward and Dalit castes
 aryasamaj va hindu sanghathanon ne thode-bahut udaaravaadi andolan chalaae,unke peeche unka vichaar yah nahin tha ki jaat-paant sambandhi swayan main buraaiyaan hai or unhen dur kiya jaae balki unki mukhya chintaa yah thi ki dalit jatiyaan unke bhedbhaavpurn ravaie se tang aakar kahin isai yaa musalmaan na ban jaaen
 This was the reason that the reformist movement soon failed
 patrakarita main daliton kii bhagidaari kyon nahin?yah tathy aankadon se spasht he ki sthapit patron,patrakarita sansthaanon va tamaam vyavsaayik patron ke varisht patrakaron yani sampadakon yaa sahasampadakon main koi dalit jati se ho,aisa meri jaankaree main nahin he
 Apart from his personal papers, when the number of backward castes is negligible in major papers and Hindi literature, then the participation of Dalits is not even started
 yathasthiti ke samarthak kahenge ki kyonki daliton main shiksha hi nahin he,ve padhe-likhe nahin hai,isliye ye sthiti he
 The question arises, what efforts were made to make him a journalist? Why not done? i fully support the charge that Hindi literature and journalism have been deliberately kept as Savarna journalism and Savarna literature and are being kept even today
 mandal virdohi andolan kii reporting ke dauraan patrakarita bilkul nishpaksh tatasth or vastuparak nahin rahi
 Because the upper caste castes have complete control over the news system
 bahut saare akhabaaron ne bhadakaau bhoomika nibhaai
 The excitement of the upper caste students was said to be burning, dying, self-sacrifice, self-sacrifice, self-sacrifice, sacrifice for the country, which is biased and condemnable
 prashikshan sansthaanon main unki naganya sankhya va pratibha ke sankat ke bare main main ek udhaaharan dena chaahunga
 In the last session i was on the interview board of Indian Institute of Mass Communication
 mujhase pehle hi kaha gaya ki chunki es
 C
 ,es
 Our level falls due to the arrival of t students, but we have reservations, so they have to be taken
 saakshaatkaar main aae chaatro main maine aise chaatr paae jo yogya to the hi,apitu bina aarakshan ke bhi daakhila paane ke laayak the
 i recommended in favor of such talents
 yah main nahin jaanata ki unhen daakhila mila yaa nahin,yah meraa nijee anubhav he
 Who will investigate the role of Hindi journalism related to Dalits and why? When people of anti-dalit castes are sitting in journalism at the above level, will they do their own investigation? i believe they will not, but will justify the status quo
 yahi ve kar rahe hai
 Reporting crimes such as rape related to women or atrocities on tribal Dalits, is the reason for entertainment of journalists
 yah dalit stri hi nahin, stri maatr ke prati ochhaapan he or yah patrakarita kii vifaltaa yaa kamajori he
 Those who do not have sympathy for these sections in their hearts, if they are sitting on top, then this cannot be reduced
 patr-patrikaon main dalit sahitya saamagree kavita,kahani yaa lekh aadi prakashit na hone ke kaarnon kaa jawaab bhi vahi he,jo pehle prashn kaa he
 If Hindi journalism is reducing or increasing ethnicity or communalism, if you consider this question, you will find that backward or Dalit castes strive for their rights, then Savarna journalism says that ethnicity is increasing, it propagates so openly 
 use do yadavon kaa mukhyamantri bananaa lagata he ki saare yadav mukhyamantri ban gaye
 But if the twelve Brahmins are the Chief Minister, nothing seems to happen
 narsingh raav va raashtrapati ke ird-gird rahane vaale tamaam salaahkaar varisht afisar brahman hai,par vah nahin dikhte
 But despite the qualifications of backward and Dalits, they will not give opportunities
 patrakarita ne jaateeyata badhaai he,kam nahin kii he
 When their interests come, they start seeing ethnicity
 yatharth main vahi patrakarita chalati he jo bikati he or vahi chalegi jo bikegi
 Savarna journalism does not print rape and other Dalit news because they have human sympathy for them, but rape sells, violence sells, so it is printed
 ye vyavsaayik kaaran hai
 Marathi Dalit literature has not been translated into Hindi, English because they have to be respected, because it too has started selling
