 In the current World Cup being played in England, two big records have been broken in a span of just two days
 20 june ko australia or bangladesh ke bich hue mukaable main donon tiimon ne kul 714 ran banaae
 This is the highest run record in any match of the ICC World Cup
 australia ne is match main pehle khelte hue 5 wicket par 381 ran kaa gaganchumbi score khadaa kiya
 Bangladesh tried to chase Australia's score showing the fighting spirit, but it reached the score of 333 for 8 wickets and lost the match
 teen din pehle england or afghanistan ke bich hue mukaable main kisi bowler kii ore se sabase zyada ran lutaaney kaa record bhi bana
 In the ICC ODI rankings, world number three bowler and Afghanistan spinner Rashid Khan bowled 9 overs and took 110 runs without taking any wickets
 ye kisi bhi world cap match main kisi bowler kaa sabase kharchila spel he
 As far as all ODI international matches are concerned, this spell of Rashid is the second most expensive
 maujuuda world cap ke in donon records se sabit hota he ki bolers kii tulana main batsman ko yahaan kii pichen kahin zyada raas aa rahi hai
 If this trend continues even further, there is a very high chance that Sachin Tendulkar's 16-year-old record of scoring the most runs in any one World Cup could also collapse
 2003 world cap main tendulkar ne 673 ran banaae the
 In the current World Cup, the two top scorers so far have amassed over 400 runs and many matches are yet to be played
 australia ke openar david warner ran banane ke maamle main fehrist main ab tak sabase awwal hai
 Warner has scored 440 runs in 6 matches so far
 warner ke baad duusare number par bangladesh ke shaakib al hasan hai
 Shakib has scored 425 runs in 6 matches so far
 bataa den ki bangladesh kaa ek match varsha kii vajah se dhul bhi gaya tha, isliye shaakib ko ab tak 5 pari main hi batting kaa mauka mila
 Warner and Shakib still have three matches to play in the league stage
 warner ke opening jodidar or australia ke captain aron finch ab tak 396 ran bana chuke hai
 The top 5 batsmen of this World Cup so far include England's Joe Root and India's vice-captain Rohit Sharma
 in 5 batsman main koun tod saktaa he sachin kaa record?india today group ke data intelegence unit ne ab tak toornament ke top 5 batsman ke ran score karne ke pattern kaa vishleshan kiya
 It was trying to know that if they continue to score with the same rhythm (average run / match) then how many runs will they be able to score after the end of all league matches and who can break the record of Tendulkar in these batsmen
 DIU kii gananaa ke mutabik, rohit sharma or shaakib al hasan lig stage ke baad 673 ran kaa aankada paar kar sakate hai basharte ki unhone baaki lig maichon main apane scoring ausat ko barkaraar rakhaa
 India has played 4 matches in this World Cup so far, 1 of which was washed away due to rain
 is tarah rohit ko ab tak teen maichon main hi batting kaa mauka mila
 Rohit has so far scored 319 runs at an average of 106 runs per match
 agar yahi ausat wo aage bhi jari rakhte hai to lig stage ke ant tak ve 850 ran se zyada ran bana sakate hai
 India are yet to play 5 more league stage matches in the current World Cup
 isi tarah, shaakib ne ab tak 5 maichon main 4 paariyaan khelkar 425 ran bana chuke hai
 Bangladesh are yet to play three league matches
 agar shaakib maujuuda ausat se hi khelte rahe to 673 ran kaa aankada aasaani se paar kar sakate hai
 Australian opener Warner can miss 673 runs at just 3 runs from his current scoring average
 vahiin finch or root ko tendulkar ke record ko paar karne ke liye apane scoring ausat ko badhanaa hoga
 Otherwise he can be left behind by many runs from '673'
 iske alaava in khilaadiyon kii team agar semifinal or final kii stage tak pahunchati hai to inhen tendulkar kaa 16 saal purana record todane main or aasaani rahegi

 congress ne is kaam main teji dikhaate hue chunaav ghoshnaa ke 3 din baad hi apni pehali list jari kar di jisamen maharashtra kii 48 siton main se 5 ke naam hai
 In these, the Congress has fielded Nanabhau Patole in Nagpur Lok Sabha seat, who will face a possible BJP candidate, Union Minister Nitin Gadkari
 ye vahi naanaa patole hai jinhone pradhanmantri narendra modi ke vyavhaar se naaraaz hokar saansad pad se istipha diya tha or baad main congress main shaamil ho gaye the
 The Congress on Wednesday released the second list of candidates for 21 seats, of which 16 are from Uttar Pradesh and 5 from Maharashtra
 isamen pichhali loksabhaa main chune gaye bhaajapa ke do saansad shaamil hai
 One is Nana Patole from Nagpur and Savitri Phule from Bahraich

 Priya Dutt from Mumbai North Central, Milind Murali Deora from Mumbai South, Sushil Shinde from Solapur, Namdev Dalluji Usendi will contest the election for the reserved seat for ST of gadchiroli-chimur

 Soon he returned to the Congress again

 With his return to the Congress, Patole won Lakhondoor in the 1999 and 2004 assembly elections
 saal 2009 main kisaanon or vidarbha ke vikaas ke mudde par patole ne congress se istipha de diya
 He contested the Lok Sabha election as an independent candidate and finished second
 is chunaav main ensipi ke prafull patel kii jeet hui, jabaki bijepi saansad rahe shishupal patle tisare number par rahe
 After winning the election by joining BJP, Patole joined BJP and won the Sakoli seat in the 2009 assembly elections
 patole ko vidhansabha main bijepi kaa upanetaa chun liya gaya
 Patole defeated NCP candidate Praful Patel in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 piem modi par patole ke aropasadhe teen saal baad nanabhau patole pradhanmantri narendra modi par nishaanaa saadhane lage
 In September 2017, Patole alleged in an event in Nagpur that PM Modi does not listen to anyone and in the party meeting, the PM did not let him speak when he was raising the issue of farmers
 uske baad patole maharashtra main bijepi sarkaar par hallaa bolne lage
 PM Modi and CM Devendra Fadnavis continued to target him
 akola main purv vitt mantri va varisht bijepi netaa yashavanth sinha dwaara yojit kisaan andolan main bhi patole shaamil hue the
 There was no realization of Patole
 a senior Congress leader had said that Nanabhau Patole never remained loyal to any party
 congress netaa ne kaha tha ki kisaanon kaa mudda sirf ek dikhaava he, patole mantri pad kii chahat rakhte hai or bijepi dwaara nazarandaaj karne par unhen party chhodane ke liye majaboor hona padaa
 Nagpur will be contesting on the seat, Nagpur, the sub-capital of Maharashtra and the most prominent city of Vidarbha, although it is the stronghold of the National self-service Association, but the Congress has won the most elections here
 vartmaan main yahaan se bijepi ke diggaj netaa or kendriya mantri nitin gadakari saansad hai
 He defeated senior four-time Congress leader Vilas Muttemwar in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections

 shanivaar ko meerut se desh ke pradhanmantri narendra modi ne apni chunavi raily kii shuruaati kii
 In the rally, Modi targeted SP, Congress, Akhilesh and Mayawati with the help of 'SCAM'
 bhaashan main modi ke mukhya nishane par akhilesh or samaajawaadee party hi rahi
 Modi had targeted the Akhilesh government and said that the illegal occupation of farmers' lands in UP in the last five years
 puraa pradesh bhrashtachar kii bhent chadh gaya he
 But in this election, voting will have to be done to remove Mafiaraj from UP
 upi chunaav main is baar bhrashtachar or mafiaraj ke khilaaf vot karnaa he, taaki ye dobaaraa satta main na aa saken
 There are many reasons for Modi's sharp attack on Akhilesh Sarkar
 aaj ham aapako kuch aise hi kaarnon se rou-ba-rou kara rahe hai ki aakhir kyon modi ne pashchimi upi main areldi or bispi ko chhod sapa par nishaanaa saadhaa
 Direct fight with SP Modi wants to send a message among the people of the state that bjp's direct fight is with the ruling Samajwadi Party
 bijepi kii stritji he ki vah khud ko kisi bhi tarah anya dalon se behatar sthiti main dikhaae
 Akhilesh's image has to be broken
 It is clear from Modi's speech that the BJP is troubled by Akhilesh's rise in popularity
 vah kisi bhi tarah akhilesh ko villen ke taur par pesh karnaa chaah rahe
 Modi blamed Akhilesh for law and order, corruption and poverty
 pashchimi upi main nahin lenaa chaahate jaaton se pangamodi ne 'scam' main to mayawati ko ghasita lekin pashchimi upi main majboot pakad vaali areldi par chuppi saadhe rakhi
 Actually, BJP does not want to tease Jat voters before the election
 2014 main jaaton ne modi ke liye vot kiya tha lekin pichley kuch samay se ve bijepi se naaraaz chal rahe hai
 In such a situation, Modi does not want to take any risk targeting the Jat leader
 hoga dhruvikaran to bijepi ko phaaydabijepi jaanati he ki upi kaa chunaav jeetna he to voton kaa dhruvikaran hona bahut jaruri he
 This is the reason why she wants to be seen competing with the SP and on the other hand its leaders are seen making Hinduist statements
 gauratlab he ki 1991 se upi main nirnaayak bhoomika nibhaane vaala 'muslim vot' usee ko jaataa he jo bijepi ko haraane kaa dam rakhata ho
 In such a situation, the BJP is eyeing the 'second pole'
 post-ellection gathbandhan kii sambhaavnasoobe main charchaa he ki jis tarah sapa or congress ne chunaav purv gathbandhan kiya he
 Similarly, if the need arises after the election, the BJP can once again go with the BSP
 aise main mayawati par tikhaa hamalaa na kar modi ne gunjaaish banaae rakhi he
 The US has said that the new Taliban leader has the opportunity to work towards finding a negotiated solution to choose peace and join Afghan policy peace talks

 Toner said in response to a question, he (haibatullah) has the opportunity to choose peace and work towards finding a solution through dialogue
 ham ummid karte hai ki vah ab yah chayan karegaa
 He said that Akhundzada's name was not included in any list with names of terrorists
 toner ne in prashnon kaa uttar nahin diya ki kya vah afghanistan main america balon ke nishane par he
 He said, i will not tell anything in this regard to whom we can target in the national security interest of America

 ) Indian cricket is under question these days
 bhartiya khilaadiyon kii fitness sawaalon ke ghere main he
 His ability is under question
 unki taiyaari sawaalon ke ghere main he
 His commitment and dedication to Test cricket is under question
 in tamaam sawaalon ke bich ek sawaal yah bhi he ki kya yah team ovel main shuukravaar ko khele jane vaale tisare ekadivasiy mukaable ke madhyam se england daure main jeet kaa sookhaa khatm kar paaegi?england daure main apane kai pramukh khilaadiyon kii chot or kharaab pradarshan se pareshaan bhartiya team ab tak chaar test match, ek twanti-20 match or ek ekadivasiy match ganvaa chuki he
 He won three practice matches but seeing the second ODI, it seemed that he had no effect on his morale
 lagaataar haar se pareshaan captain mahendra singh dhoni ab sawaalon se itane ghabara gaye hai ki vah khud hi patrakaron se sawaal kar rahe hai
 For example, what can i do? ek samay aisa tha jab danaadan jeet hasil karne vaale is captain ko bolte hue rokane kii jarurat padati thi lekin ab unke paas shabd kam padate dikhaai de rahe hai
 The beginning of the second ODI after being restricted to 23–23 overs, it was felt that the Indian team would win the match and break the losing streak but the bowlers lost the hard work of the batsmen
 jab kabhi bhartiya gendbaaj acha karte hai to ballebaaj unki mehnat par pani pher dete hai or jab ballebaaj acha karte hai to gendbaaj sari ranneeti ko matiamet kar dete hai
 All this is happening due to lack of confidence
 teesraa ekadivasiy match bhi barish ke saaye ke bich khelaa jayega kyonki england main yah jhamajham barish kaa vakt hota he
 In such a situation, Indian players will have to be ready to play with the Twenty20 mentality while saving their wickets
 mahendra singh dhoni ko yah yaad rakhana hoga ki test shrinkhalaa main unhone sarvocch variyata praapt team ke taur par apni saakh ganvaai he lekin ekadivasiy shrinkhalaa main vishwa champion ke taur par uski saakh daanv par he
 This credit could be in jeopardy after the loss at the Oval as they would lose their chance to win the series after trailing 0–2

 Former Supreme Court judge Markandey Katju has taunted Pakistani cricketer Shahid Afridi
 unhone (markandey Katju) apane fasebuk post main likhaa ki pakistan cricketer shahid afridi jaise muslim jo apni betiyon ko outdoor game khilne kii ijaajat nahin dete hai, murkh, pichde, saamanti dimag vaale bade log, pratikriyaavaadi or murkh hai
 Markandey Katju further wrote in his Facebook post that anyone making stupid or vulgar comments on this post will be blocked with immediate effect
 isliye kuch likhane se pehle iskaa khyal jarur rakhen
 This comment about Shahid Afridi has been liked by more than 500 people within just two hours
 jabaki 159 logon ne coment or kul 15 logon ne share kiya he
 Let me tell you that this is not the first time Markandey Katju has been making headlines because of his statement
 isse pehle unhone kaha tha ki apni zindagi main kai faisle kiye honge, lekin unke mutabik, aaj vah ek antarjaateey vivaah ko lekar asamanjas main hai
 Explain that Markandey Katju had sought advice from an educated couple who wanted to get married, but belonged to different castes, and the girl's parents were strongly against marriage
 supreme courtke purv nyaayadhish ke anusaar, bahut-se yuvak-yuvatiyaan unase shaadi ko lekar salaah maangate rahe the, jab ve alag-alag jatiyon se hon, or ek-duusare se pyaar karte hon, lekin unke mata-pita (yaa kisi ek ke mata-pita) shaadi ke sakht khilaaf hon
 Markandeya Katju had said that since the young man has expressed confidence in her, she should be given the right advice
 lekin haal hi main unhen fasebuk par ek sandesh mila, jisamen anusuchit jati kaa ek yuvak or anya pichde varg kii ek ladki ek-duusare se mohabbat karte hai, or shaadi karnaa chaahate hai, lekin yuvati ke mata-pita shaadi ke sakht khilaaf hai
 Both also work as doctors in a government hospital in the same city, but according to the parents of the girl, this marriage will hurt their dignity in society
 supreme court ke purv nyaayadhish ke anusaar, "meri soch yah kahati he ki aisi sthiti main vidroh karnaa sahi he, kyonki jati vyavastha hamaare samaaj ke liye shraap he, or yah jitna jaldi khatm ho, utana behatar hoga
 
 
 Inter-caste and inter-religious marriages help eliminate casteism, so it is good for the country
 
 
 lekin duusari ore, vaastaviktaa ko bhi dekha janaa zaruri he
 
 
 In this case, the girl's parents are suffering from high blood pressure and other diseases, and if their daughter marries a Dalit youth, it would be a shock to them, which could lead them to a heart attack and death
 Or they can commit suicide
 
 
 "justise markendeya katju ke mutabik, unki kashmakash yahi he, agar main yuvak-yuvati ko shaadi karne kaa suzav detaa hum, to mere haath khun se rang sakate hai
 
 
 So, what advice should i give them? 
 
 ? apane siddhanton ke viruddh jaaun, yaa apane haathon ko khun se rangane se bachaaun

 Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has lied to the people in the matter of giving full state status to Delhi
 is mudde par dilli ke log ab or anyaay bardaasht nahin karenge
 Arvind Kejriwal said on Sunday, this is a false excuse that Delhi cannot be given full state status because of being the capital of the country, this excuse will no longer run
 kyonki dilli ke log puure endiemasi aria kaa control centre sarkaar ko dene ke liye taiyaar hai, lekin baaki dilli jahaan ek chuni hui sarkaar he, use centre sarkaar ke adheen nahin choda ja saktaa
 The Chief Minister said that the Narendra Modi government should allow the elected government of Delhi to function without interfering in an unjust manner and stop impeding the functioning of Delhi government
 isko lekar saare sambhav vikalp aajamaae gaye lekin usamen koi kamyaabi nahin mili
 Kejriwal said that there is no way left for the full state to sit on indefinite fast from March 1
 kejariwal ne kaha ki pichley chaar saal main modi sarkaar aadesh paarit karke dilli sarkaar kii shaktiyaan chhinti gai
 This deception of the Central Government with the people of Delhi is now in the people's court, which is the largest court of democracy
 mukhyamantri kejariwal ne kaha, sisitivi, skool, aspataal, mohalla clinics aadi dilliwaalon ke har kaam main adchane lagaayee
 We made every effort and entranced them, staged a sit-in
 court bhi gaye lekin koi rasta nahin bachaa to upwas kar rahe hai
 Kejriwal said the bjp's stand on the issue of granting a full state to Delhi has been exposed, as it has overturned its decades-old promise to give Delhi a full state
 unhone ye bhi kaha ki dilli ko purna rajya dene ke maamle main bijepi ke maujuuda virodh se spasht he ki 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaavon ke dauraan modi ji ne dilli kii janata se jhooth bolaa tha
 The people of Delhi will answer their lies
 dilli ko purna rajya kaa darja dene ke maamle par bijepi ko uskaa vaada yaad dilaate hue kejariwal ne kaha ki swargeey atal bihari vaajapeyi kii sarkaar main tatkaaleen up-pradhanmantri or grih mantri laal krishna adwani ji loksabhaa main dilli ko purna rajya kaa darja dilaane ke liye bill lekar aae the
 As the home minister of the country, Advani ji introduced the bill giving full statehood to Delhi in the Lok Sabha in August 2003
 diggaj congress netaa pranab da kii aguwai vaali home afares kii parliamentry cameti ne disambar 2003 main is bill kaa samarthan kiya tha lekin is bill ko aakhirkaar aage nahin badhane diya gaya
 Was this done only to play with the feelings of the people of Delhi? Why this injustice to the people of Delhi? Advaniji, as Home Minister, in August 2003 introduced statehood for Delhi Bill in Lok Sabha
 Pranab da headed parliamentary comm endorsed it in Dec 2003, but it finally lapsed
 Did they intend to just play with the emotions of people of Delhi? Why this injustice with Delhiites? - Arvind Kejriwal (@arvindkejriwal) February 24, 2019 Delhi is the capital of the country, so it cannot be given full state status, rejecting the argument Kejriwal said, yes, Delhi, India's Is the capital
 isliye centre ko puure endiemasi aria ko apane control main rakhana chahie lekin baaki dilli jisaki apni chuni hue ek sarkaar he, use puri tarah se centre sarkaar ke adheen kaise rakhaa ja saktaa he
 Such injustice will no longer be tolerated
 Yes, Delhi is India's national capital, so let the Centre keep entire NDMC area under its complete control
 How can rest of Delhi, in which Delhiites elect their own govt, be kept subservient to the center? No more injustice to be tolerated
 — Arvind Kejriwal (@arvindkejriwal)february 24, 2019 Investors 7 from the worldwide stock markets last week due to unrest in West Asia and North Africa and the Japanese nuclear crisis
 68 arab dollar kii nikasi kii
 2 of emerging markets out of it
 65 arab dollar kii nikasi hui
 The nuclear crisis in Japan and the political crisis in West Asia and North Africa led to large scale withdrawals from equity markets
 23 march ko samaapt saptaah main duniyabar ke equity bazaar se 7
 $ 68 billion has been withdrawn
 isamen ubharate bazaaron kaa yogadan 2
 65 billion dollars
 vaishvik str par kosh ke bare main soochna rakhane vaali company ipiemaar ke aankadon ke mutabik is saal ubharate bazaaron ke equity bazaar se bade paimaane par paisa nikaala gaya
 So far this year, $ 27 billion has been withdrawn
 report main yah bhi kaha gaya he ki saptaah kii shuruyaat main niveshak phir se equity bazaar main paisa lagane lage hai
 However, it is not as much as the money was withdrawn from it last week
 haal ke maheenon main bharat or china samet kai ubharate bazaar mahangaai se peedit hai
 This threatens to derail the global economy
 baharhaal, ipieefar kii report main bhartiya bazaar se nikaale gayi paise ke bare main alag se soochna nahin he
 According to the information available with SEBI, Foreign Institutional Investors (fiis) in the said period 11
 483 karod dollar bazaar se nikaale
 a well-known anti-terrorism expert from the US has said that the international terrorist organization Al Qaeda wants to portray Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi as an enemy of Islam and that India should take his threat 'very seriously'
 baharhaal, america ne al kaayda kii kshamtaaon ko zyada tavajjo nahin dene kii koshish kii
 "this is the first video of (al Qaeda leader Ayman al) Zawahiri this year and should be taken very seriously," former CIA expert Bruce Riedel, considered America's top counter-terrorism expert, told PTI
 al kaayda pradhanmantri modi ko islam ke dushman ke taur par chitrit karnaa chahta he
 "al Qaeda is a threat to India because of its base in Pakistan and its close alliance with lashkar-e-taiba," Riedel said
 unhone yah baat tab kahi, jab unase jawahiri ke taaje video ke bare main poocha gaya, jisamen usne bharat ke kashmir, gujarat or assam main jihad shuru karne ke liye tathaa khilaafat sthapit karne kaa lakshya hasil karne ke liye or afghanastin se myanmar tak shariat lagu ke liye bhartiya upmahadweep main ek nai shakha kholane kii ghoshnaa kii he
 Riedel reiterated that the new government of India should take this threat very seriously
 unhone kaha ki nai dilli ko america or afghanistan ke saath aatank virdohi sahyog badhanaa chahie
 Anti-terrorism cooperation between India and the United States has increased significantly since the 2008 Mumbai terror attack
 baharhaal america ko video yaa nai shakha al kaaydaat banane kii pramanita ko abhi satyapit karnaa he
 "we have not been able to confirm it so far," State Department Deputy Spokeswoman Mari Harf told a daily press conference
 swaabhaavik rup se ham yah chaah rahe hai ki agar is bare main or jaankaree he, to use ham hasil karen
 He said that we do not see this announcement as an indication of the new capabilities of Al Qaeda
 unhone doharaaya ki america al kaayda ko dhwast karne ke liye patibaddh he, kyonki yah kahin bhi ho america ke liye khatra he
 It is also to ensure that al Qaeda could not restore its capability against the US
 redelle jaise kai aatank virdohi visheshgy america videsh mantralay ke is rukh se sahamat nahin hai
 They say this is a new threat from al Qaeda
 'middle east media research institute' (emmarai) ke 'jihad and terarysm threat monitor' ke tauffil ahamed kehete hai, mere khyaal se, dakshin asia ke liye al kaayda kii shakha sthapit karne kii al jawahiri kii ghoshnaa pareshaan karne vaali he, kyonki yah 11 sintabar ke hamale kii barsi se kuch din pehle hui he
 For the security of the nation, the brave soldiers, who are posted all the time on the border, have asked the countrymen to light a lamp in memory of the martyrs
 seemaa suraksha bal (BSF) ke javaanon ne sabhi deshavaasiyo se aahvaan kiya he ki deepawali par jammu-kashmir main aatankwaadiyon ke saath ladate hue shahid javaanon kii yaad main ek diya yaa mombatti jarur jalaaen, jisase unke parivaar waalon ko garv mahasoos ho
 We celebrate Diwali and other festivals peacefully within the country thanks to the promptness of these brave soldiers
 ye apni jaan kii baaji lagaakar desh kii suraksha karte hai
 BSF sub-inspector Darshan Singh, who considers Deepawali with fencing on the Suchetgarh border in the entire sector of Ranbir Singh, says that the soldiers posted on the border can be remembered only when Deepawali in memory of the martyred soldiers of every country
 But light a lamp
 bihar ke rahane walebsef ke javathshok kumaar sahu kaa kahana he ki unako deepawali ke tyohaar par apane parivaar waalon se dur rahane kaa afsos to he, lekin desh kii suraksha sarvopari he
 The family comes after protecting the country
 iske alaava biguef ke jawan arun kumaar singh kaa kahana he ki seemaa par petroling or alertnes rakhana hamaara pehla kaam he or tyohaar baad main aata he
 This time, jawans are celebrating Diwali along the International Border adjoining Punjab
 haalanki unke saath bhi is maukey par parivaar nahin maujuud he
 For some time, there has been continuous firing and firing from Pakistan on the international border in Ranbir Singh entire sector of Jammu
 pakistan lagaataar sijafire kaa ulanghan kar rahaa he or bhartiya chaukiyon ko nishaanaa bana rahaa he
 However, the Pakistani Army is being given a befitting reply from India
 haal hi main pakistan kii ore se hui golibari main kai jawan shahid ho gaye the
 Apart from this, Modi government is also continuously celebrating Diwali with the security forces to boost their morale
 is baar bhi piem modi bharat-china seemaa par sainikon ke saath diwali manaayenge
 At the same time, Defense Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will also perform Diwali with the soldiers in Andaman and Nicobar Islands
 samaajawaadee party ke sansthaapak mulaayam singh yadav kii choti bahu aparnaa yadav ko apana raajnneetik bhavishya shivpal yadav kii bajaay akhilesh yadav ke saath rahane main zyada surakshit najar aa rahaa he
 This is the reason that she has started to clamor to go open with uncle Shivpal
 sutron kii maane to aparnaa ek baar phir sapa adhyaksh akhilesh yadav se apane rishte sudhaarney main jute gai hai
 If sources are to be believed, Aparna Yadav is eyeing the Sambhal Lok Sabha seat in Uttar Pradesh
 sanbhal sansadeey seat sapa or mulaayam parivaar kii paramparaagat seat maani jaati he
 Mulayam Singh Yadav and Ram Gopal Yadav have been mps from Sambhal
 maujuuda samay main bhi loksabhaa sansadeey seat ke tahat aane vaali teen vidhansabha siton par sapa kaa kabja he
 Aparna Yadav is contesting the Sambhal seat as Mulayam's political legacy
 lekin agar sapa is seat par unhen tikat nahin detii he to bhi wo party ke liye star prachaarak kii bhoomika main rah sakati he
 Let us know that the supporters of Aparna Yadav had given a big welcome program to SP President Akhilesh Yadav in the district office of Lucknow recently
 itnaa hi nahin lakhanu ke aasapaas ke ilaakon main aparnaa yadav ke samarthak akhilesh yadav kii sabhaaon main lagaataar dikhaai de rahe hai
 According to Aparna's close friends after the SP-BSP alliance in the state, the Samajwadi Party has become stronger and Shivpal Yadav is not able to pose a big challenge
 yahi vajah thi ki aparnaa ne ek baar phir doharaaya ki vah vahiin rahengi, jahaan netaji rahenge, yani saaf he ki vah samaajawaadee party chhodkar nahin jaaengi
 Recently, in a special conversation with Aaj Tak, Aparna Yadav said that a good press has been sent to the state due to the joint press conference of Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati
 sapa-basapa gathbandhan se donon jameen par kaaphi majboot sthiti main hai
 However, Aparna Yadav was last seen in Shivpal Yadav's Lucknow rally, in which Mulayam Singh Yadav was also present
 isi baad se aparnaa ne lagbhag shivpal yadav kii party se kinaaraa kar rakhaa he
 She has not participated in any program
 jabaki shivpal yadav kii party pragatisheel samaajawaadee party kii taraf se aparnaa yadav ko soobe main koi bhi sansadeey seat chunane kaa ofer mila he
 Aparna is keeping her political footsteps alive, which is why she has not yet agreed to contest elections on behalf of the Progressive Samajwadi Party
 haalanki aparnaa karibiyon ke mutabik wo lakhanu kii seat dobaaraa chunaav nahin ladengi

 taiwan kii tech company Asus ne haal hi main bharat main apane premium segment ke smartphone Asus 6Z ko launch kiya he
 The company has removed the branding of Zenfone, so it is now Asus 6Z
 yah smartphone bhartiya yugers main alag tarah ke selfi camere kii vajah se charchaa main rahaa
 Asus 6Z has a flip camera module which is really great
 iske kai alag alag yuj bhi hai, lekin sirf selfi camere kii vajah se smartphone acha yaa bura nahin hota he
 Asus 6Z has two variants - 6GB / 64GB and 8GB / 128GB
 keemat kii baat karen to shuruaati verient aapako 31,999 rupee main milegaa, jabaki 128GB verient kii keemat 34,999 rupee rakhi gai he
 This premium smartphone has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 chipset, a flip dual camera and a 5,000mah battery
 dizin or bild qualitypasus 6Z ko maine kuch dinon tak yuj kiya he
 Seems premium
 dizin acha he, bild quality main bhi koi kami nahin he
 The design of this phone justifies its price
 yani aap agar 30 hajaar rupee se zyada kaa smartphone kharid rahe hai to jaahir he aapako ek premium phone kii ummid hogi or ye phone is par khara utarataa he
 Gorilla Glass is given on the rear panel of the phone, which is curved
 phone hold karne main ye haathon se phisalata nahin he
 You will see the full screen in the front of the phone, although Chin Aa will notice
 rier panel par hi flip camere kaa placement kiya gaya he
 There is a slight problem in the placement of the flip camera
 isamen dust aasaani se bhar jaati he
 Flip camera comes out Dust easily takes place at this place
 isi flip camere main dual elidi flash or lager autofocus sensor he jo donon camera sensor ke bich main he
 It is also used for facial recognition
 rier panel par fingerprint scinar ke saath blue Asus kaa logo he
 The company could also provide an under display fingerprint
 kul mila kar dizin or bild quality acchhee he or ye premium he
 Display Asus 6Z 6
 4 inch kii disple di gai he
 This is Full HD Plus, which has a resolution (1080X2340)
 disple main HDR 10 kaa saport diya gaya he
 The display is really beautiful, no notch or cutout is given
 ol screen smartphone he
 There are bezels in the bottom, but the bezels are quite low around
 vuing angel acha he, screen brit he, colorphul or sharp he
 We have not felt any such deficiency in the display, due to which it can be said that it has a display average
 cameramujhe lagata he Asus 6Z ke camere kaa istemaal kai tareekon se kiya ja saktaa he
 If you like photography then you will really like it, but the quality can be improved further
 company ne flip camera ke saath acha experiment kiya he or flip camera movement ko aap control kar sakate hai jo acchhee baat he
 Talking about camera specs, the Asus 6Z flip camera module has two cameras
 ek main soni kaa 48 megapixl kaa lens he yani Sony IMX586
 This sensor is quite popular nowadays
 doosraa camera 13 megapixl kaa he or yahaan aapako 125 degree kaa field of vyuu miltaa he
 Can control the camera module, it can be called the best selfie camera of the segment
 kyonki rier camera ko hi aap selfi camere ke taur par yuj kar sakate hai
 As soon as you open the selfie camera interface, the camera comes out of its place at the top and you can click the selfie
 camera interphes main is flip camere ko control karne kaa opshan bhi diya gaya he jo kaaphi dilachasp he
 You can move this flip camera according to your mind
 speed bhi aap tay kar sakate hai
 The automatic pano shots are really great
 kisi bhi angel kii photo (limited angel) clic kar sakate hai
 If the company had given 360 degree camera in this phone to make it revolutionary, then the matter was different
 ab baat karte hai camera quality kii
 Photos are good, but wide angle lens rotation does not affect
 portret mod main clic kii gai tasviren acchhee aati hai or ye becoground ko behatar tareeke se detect karke alag rakhata he
 Asus 6Z does not provide optical image stabilization or OIS and its drawback is definitely missed
 delite yaa lo lite main photography acchhee hoti he, photose main diteling hoti he, koi dikkat yaa pareshaani nahin he
 The option of super night mode is given to click photos in low light
 isse photose clear aati hai, lekin image se aap ditels kii ummid nahin kar sakate hai
 Talking about video, you can do 4K recording
 lekin yah sirf 10 minute tak ke liye limited he
 However, if you do 60 frames per second, then you will get only 5 minutes
 video ke dauraan aap camera switch nahin kar sakate hai yani normal lens se wide angel lens main nahin ja sakate hai
 Asus 6z's camera flip camera module and camera quality can be called good
 kam se kam duusari companiyon kii tarah yahaan pop ap selfi camera nahin diya he jo sirf ek kaam ke liye hote hai or wo ye ki noch se bachane ke liye
 Anyway, there is no significant difference with the small notch
 Asus 6Z ko nae camera experiment ke liye Thumps Up
 But it should be improved further
 khaas taur par dust vaali samasya
 Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 has been given in the performance Asus 6Z, which is currently the company's flagship processor
 do memory verients hai jiske bare main hamane upar bataaya he
 This smartphone runs on Android 9
 isaki bydaree 5,000mah kii he
 USB Type c is provided for connectivity
 fast charging kaa bhi saport he
 There is a headphone jack, micro SD card support, and excellent stereo speakers
 maine ab tak kai smartfones ke parformens ke bare main likhaa he jisamen Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 die gaye hai
 This too is not a revolutionary phone in terms of performance
 saadhaaran yuj main koi pareshaani nahin aati he phone smood chalata he, lag nahin hai, hang nahin karata or fast he
 You can make it even faster by using the AI boost Mode given in it
 gaming ke liye ye phone thik thaak he
 Games like PUBG run well on full settings
 multi tasking main koi samasya nahin he
 Apps do not take time to load
 yujar interphes bhi thik thaak hi he
 My experience has been good in watching videos or gaming due to the display being big and great
 is phone kaa sound impressive he
 Songs can be heard like this

 India and Pakistan were the two biggest rivals in the cricket world
 javagal shrinath ne bhi bataaya ki sachin tendulkar kii sabase zyada taiyaari pakistan ke khilaaf match se pehle dikhti thi
 So how was Sachin playing against Pakistan? What did his name mean to Pakistani players? India Today Group's Conclave 'salaam Sachin' answered these questions by two of Pakistan's most dangerous bowlers - Yunus and Shoaib Akhtarne
 padhie, aaj tak kesports editor vikrant guptase baatcheet, jisamen shoeb aapako apane 'sens of humar' kaa istemaal karte bhi najar aaenge
 How difficult is it to play cricket for so long? Waqar: Really
 itani fitness ke saath khelnaa
 i started playing Tests with him
 ritairement ko mere das saal ho gaye
 Now it is time to retire from commentary
 magar wo ab bhi khel rahe hai
 His dedication is amazing
 wo apana bat bhi hotel lekar jaataa tha
 He worshiped cricket, as people worship him here
 shaayad yahi vajah he
 Shoaib Akhtar: Allah gave him many qualities
 yaad rakhie vah sirf achche batsman nahin, hambal insaan bhi hai
 He has also given respect and he also kept control
 femes hone ke baad bhi kreji nahin hue
 Gave him so much money, i wish give me half of it
 badi tamanna he phantum le luun
 Spent time with him in 2007
 khaanaa ikatthe khate the
 We went to Sahara Shree's party in Lucknow
 uske baad ham walk ke liye gaye
 I, Sachin, Sehwag
 yuvaraj
 i found it fun
 maine kaha sachin se ki aapako uthaa luun main? wo bole ki ye na kari
 But i lifted it and he slipped
 maine uthaakar unhen jhappi daal lee
 If something happens to you, India will burn me alive
 wo hansane laga
 Allah has given great quality to the fellow
 vakaar aapane 150 kii raftaar se gend phenki sachin ko unke pehle test main
 You have not thought why i am throwing this child? Waqar: i am proud that i started Test cricket with Sachin Tendulkar
 yebahut khaas tha
 We felt that they were joking
 isaki dadhi-moonch bhi nahin ai
 i remember that Jadeja and Mongia were in the Under-19 team before that tour
 ve baat kar rahe the sachin ke bare main
 But when we saw Sachin, i thought, where did he get this child from? sachin ko ball lagi to bhai ajit bole, mujhe bheed main sunai diya
 Waqar: It was engaged, it was not very fast
 jitna bana diya gaya
 Blood was coming
 magar vah neeche nahin gira tha
 His helmet was without a grill
 usne sir hilaayaa
 Paused for two to three minutes and then started playing
 shoeb:or us dauraan sledging to chal hi rahi thi
 Especially during the match between Pakistan and India
 bich main ampire fansata he
 He falls from both sides
 vakaar:us dauraan hamaari team acchhee thi
 Javed Miandad, Salim Malik and Imran Khan were
 nae main main or wasim akram the
 In such a situation it was difficult to face us on green pitches
 magar sachin bahut acha khelaa
 Imran Khan had said that Inzamam plays fast bowler better than Sachin
 aapkaa kya kahana he?vakaar:wo sabase upar he cricket kii duniya main
 Only his figures tell
 sirf gharelu nahin, usne har tarah kii pich par ran banaae
 The West Indies that people were afraid of
 vahaan jaakar maarna
 Shoaib Akhtar: i didn't even have an idea
 sachin kaa bhi zyada idia nahin tha
 i did not know that there would be a chance to play in the third Test
 main hameshaa vakaar bhai ko follow karata
 Inspiration and talent in our Pakistan cricket is over
 paise nahin hai
 There is a lot of contrast
 mujhe last main pataa laga ki viki bhai nahin khel rahe
 i did not even wear shoes until then
 baad main laga ki ye to bana hi he cricket ke liye
 Then the sledding stopped
 hameshaa garv laga ki main iske saath khel rahaa hum
 Was trying not to get beaten too much
 or jab uskaa wicket liya to bahut sammaan mahasoos kiya
 It always seemed that the cricketer got the wicket, which changed the way and history of the game
 do teen chijen clear kar duun
 i never said that he was afraid of me
 maine ye kaha tha ki unki albo kharaab thi
 He could not hook and pull
 maine us cheez ko exploit kiya
 i said Sachin was not comfortable
 magar baad main haua khadaa ho gaya
 i have often said how much Sachin should do alone
 jab unako help mili, to team ke nattejey dikhne lage
 Was just playing IPL match in Bombay
 croud wo bhi vahaan kaa
 i told Shahrukh that if i dismiss Sachin, he will not leave
 wo bole boundry par mat khadey hona
 Did the same
 sachin bhi baad main bole, yaar tuune phir out kar diya
 
 
 
 
 Waqar's time India mostly lost
 shoeb ke time haraana shuru kar diya
 Was Sachin the biggest reason for this? Waqar: It would be wrong, just to give credit to Sachin
 team develop ho rahi thi
 Always played under pressure against Pakistan
 sharajah main match hote the
 Our bowling lineup was good
 saurav ganguli ko credit milanaa chahie
 As he developed the team
 sachin ij sachin
 He will have to give credit for everything
 test hi nahin
 One Day and Twenty Twenty
 sachin ke alaava
 Rahul Dravid and Laxman
 ajay jadeja bhi
 Brought a lot of spark
 abhi jaise dhauni, raina, viraat aae to spark le aae
 Changes were happening at that time
 phir wo jeetne lage or ham haarane lage
 Akhtar: Sachin scored in every IRA
 duniya kya kahati he etties main, ninties main
 In Ninties i think that was the toughest bowling in the world
 wasim, vakaar bhai, maikgra, warne, sakalan mushtak, walsh, ambros
 Fast bowling was very strong
 mere khyaal se us ira main ran karnaa sabase mushkil tha
 Then Sachin scored
 tab bounsar bhi puure ke 6 ke 6 kar sakate the
 The ball was also reverse
 aise main jisane 85 se 2000 kii ira main ran banaae
 He is amazing and he has scored against every bowler in the world, everywhere
 apni class bataa di
 Waqar was not in the team in 2004
 peshawarairportki baat he
 The Pakistani team was already standing
 shahid afridi khadey the
 He said to Sachin - come on ahead, Yuvraj said, do it for me anytime
 shahid bole, tu aadha bhi sachin jaisaa ho jayega, to puraa airport khaali karvaa duungaa
 How much was there in the dressing room? Waqar: He played Neat Clean Cricket
 controvarsi main uskaa naam nahin aayaa
 Have played the Gentleman game
 aap dekhie juniurs se kis tarah milte hai wo
 Have played 24 years, almost two and a half decades
 unhone chaar peediyaan dekhi hai cricket kii
 Some who retired in front
 kuch jo saamne shuru hue
 You will also tell the junior most cricketer, he also sees how he has played
 dressing room main sab respect karte hai
 i don't think anyone else will be able to play like that anymore
 pakistani dressing room main jab meeting hoti thi to sachin par kitni baat hoti thi?akhtar:meeting usee par focus rahati thi
 Many times think that he should take the kit bag
 magar wo hameshaa bag saath lekar chalata
 There was also security
 dost bhi nahin tha itnaa ki koi baat kar legaa
 We knew that India team used to come down as soon as Sachin was out
 magar jab vah khelte the to allaah ne ability itani zyada di he ki bade smood dhang se khelte the
 We used to talk on the out swing in the meeting
 unka bat kai baar baahar aa jaataa
 So that was to put out swing
 par by chance hi age lagata tha uskaa
 Sehwag was playing Lethal at that time
 sahvaag-sachin kaa opening stand jaalim kism kaa tha
 Get rid of one person and the other would fall behind
 dravid ke aane ke baad batting line bahut strong hui
 i used to tell him that you took a turn outside
 bahut thakaata he tu
 You remember in 2003 there was a match for Centurion
 lunch brake main sachin ne kuch nahin khaaya tha
 Just ate ice cream and chased 270 runs in that era
 kya expect kiya tha aapane?vakaar:ham comfortable the
 At that time Shoaib and Wasim were bowling well
 hamane sochaa ki arli wicket nikaalte hai or mere bajaay shoeb shuruaati over phenke
 Never thought that he would do such a plan
 pataa nahin ki plan tha ki hit of da moment tha
 Did not know what happened
 sahvaag ko is tarah se khelte dekha he
 But he did not see Sachin being killed like this
 sachin time lete hai
 Inning build
 magar wo aae or pehle chaar-paanch over main hi bahut peeche chale gaye
 By the time we were even out four-five
 bahut let ho gaya tha
 Initially both of them attacked
 sahvaag out hue, to sachin duusare player ho gaye
 Akhtar: My knee was swollen before that night
 teen injection lagavaaye captain ko bataae bagaiyr
 They know that the knee has been broken since 95
 doctor bol rahaa tha paanch test khelo
 Make money by making an ad, etc
 par main mental ability ke boote kheltaa rahaa
 Sachin looked focused when he came to Centurion that day
 bowling jo main karnaa chaah rahaa tha ho nahin rahi thi
 He was not stopping the ball, punching
 wicket bhi acha tha
 Then felt that i should bowl on the cut, maybe on the body
 magar diarection gir rahi thi
 He shot so loudly that the point came at six
 kaaphi saal sochataa rahaa ki mere ek chakka khaane se india itnaa khush hota he, to roj na kha luun
 Sachin batting amazing that day
 maine kaha viki bhai ball gir hi nahin rahi
 He again came to bowl himself and dismissed Sehwag
 magar sachin ko jahaan ball karo, maar dete the
 You know the rest of our fielding Mashalla
 termineter kii tarah khadey rahete hai bande
 Razzaq was standing with me
 hamaari lado thi
 If you talk something, you will get angry
 sidhaa stiff khadaa tha
 i said move it
 sachin kaa din tha, usne hashr kar diya hamaara
 Here too
 udhar bhi
 You can't do anything when there is so much player on the role
 vakaar:mujhe lagata ki is bade match ke alaava ek badi ining thi chennai test 99 kii
 She was very special
 uski back main problem thi
 The wicket was getting square
 sakalan or afridi shandaar bowling kar rahe the
 But this lion's child stood alone
 lakili hamaara jaik lag gaya
 How difficult was the wicket that we dealt within three overs of his dismissal
 
 
 aapane lara, poting, sachin or wa ko bowling kii
 Where does Sachin stay in front of him? Waqar: Everyone has their quality
 ninsaphi hogi kisi ek ko chunanaa
 But if i am the captain and i have to choose one, i will choose Sachin
 sachin hameshaa clic karne ke baad bada score karte hai
 Changing Fifty to Hundred is amazing
 akhtar:ek cheez kaaman thi
 We both had a weight of a bat
 stans bhi match tha
 i told Sachin that the difference is only 13-14 thousand runs
 tallent hamaara ek hi he
 (laughter) The difference between these batsmen is a big man
 kisi ek ko chodo
 Sachin will be killed like this
 injamaam aise maaregaa
 Brian Lara would be killed with so much style
 sachin kii class ij just rhite ap der
 If someone wants to call him the number one batsman, it should not be doubted
 kuch inings jo femes hai
 Apart from that, the team was down in Old Trafford
 dilari se kiya
 Funny thing was, the small bridge also hit
 badi bhi maari
 Took the entire match alone
 jab cricket peak main tha, vakaar-wasim ke jamaane main, tab india-pakistan kii test cricket nahin hui
 It is not ten years without cricket? Waqar: Rigret is to him and to us
 itani badi cricket ho hi nahin sakati thi
 He also missed it
 unke kariyar main ye rah gaya
 Did not score as many runs as he could
 hamen bhi laga ki out kar sakate the
 What can life be like after cricket? Such a good person will not go to India
 unki pregence bahut jaruri he
 In the dressing room
 taaki bachche slip out na kar saken
 Virat is going well
 rohit sharma india kaa sachin ke baad sabase bada batsman aa rahaa he
 Setting goals for all of them is extremely important
 sachin ko chahie ki apana past puraa bhul jaaen or fresh shuruyaat karen
 But India will not let them forget
 jahaan jaaenge, log kahenge, aapane ye kiya tha, wo kiya tha
 This happens with every cricketer
 jab wo chodta he to do saal to samaj hi nahin aata
 What to do subah utho, sofe par baithe hai, juraaben pahane moti vaali
 Winter feels big
 samaj nahin aata, karnaa kya he
 Lost
 mujhe ummid he ki vah jald hi nae sire se biji ho jaaen
 Work closely with BCCI
 puraa india khulaa padaa he
 ICC can work
 jang na lagane den
 The first question from the conference was asked by Sachin's brother Ajit Tendulkar: It is being mentioned in Syalkot's debut match
 jab sachin ko vakaar kii bounsar lagi or khun laga
 We loved Waqar's axon and bowling
 ab kitni jor se lagi, ye sachin hi kah saktaa tha
 Akhtar: You are saying as a brother, my brother would have come out of the TV
 doosraa sawaal poocha, gulshan grover ne:main cricket kaa bahut bada fain hum
 Sachin's as well as yours
 meraa sawaal aapke aakhri jawaab se judaa he, do teen din pehle main dinar par aayaa to dravid se mila, poocha
 i did not understand that this is a retirement in cricket
 jab itnaa kuch he game se judaa hua, tallent, experions, phir ekadam se kehete hai ki ritairement
 Why is it that talent cannot be used completely even after being removed from the team
 kariyar ke second ining yaa ritairement kaa riinvension kyon nahin kar saktaa, mere dhandhe main dekhie
 At first the hero used to get old and sit at home
 magar amitabh bachchan ko dekhie
 Waqar: Everything has its end
 aap cricket khel len, tivi kar len
 The rolls keep changing
 hero ke rup main aate hai, fadar yaa chachaa ban jate hai
 This is also the case in cricket
 ek level ke baad aap international cricket nahin khel pate
 Veteran cricket lasted for some time
 magar phir uske liye bhi gunjaaish nahin bachi
 So much cricket is happening
 
 BCCI will do something about it
 jaise sunil gavaskar kar rahe hai
 Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav is now trying to show who is the real boss
 somvaar ko do cabinet mantriyon ko apane mantrimandal se hataane ke baad mangalvaar ko bakreed ke din unhone uttar pradesh ke chif secretary deepak singhl kii bhi chuttee kar di
 Deepak Singhal, an IAS officer who was always in controversy, was made the Chief Secretary two months ago
 yah baat jagajaahir he kiakhilesh yadavadeepak singhl ko pasand nahin karte the or unhen mukhya sachiv banaae jane ke khilaaf the
 But under the pressure of Mulayam Singh Yadav, he had to make Deepak Singhal the Chief Secretary
 rahul bhatnagar bane mukhya sachivvitt vibhaag ke pramukh sachiv rahul prasad bhatnagar ko nayaa mukhya sachiv banaaya gaya he
 Rahul Bhatnagar is a 1983 batch IAS officer and has held various important positions including the sugarcane commissioner
 kaha jaataa he ki akhilesh yadav se unka acha talmail he
 Deepak Singhal is currently on the waiting list
 mukhya sachiv banane ke baad deepak singhl ke taur tareeke se mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav khush nahin the
 The unseen manner in which Deepak Singhal spoke from the stage in many public functions was constantly knocking Akhilesh Yadav
 jab manch par akhilesh se kaha- baatcheet baad main karen, pehle meri baat sunempichley maheene kanya vidyadhan baantne ke ek samaaroh main log us samay dang rah gaye jab deepak singhl ne manch par mike se mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav se kaha tha ki vah baatcheet baad main karen, pehle unki baat dhyaan se sunen
 The Chief Minister was discussing something with his mentor Alok Ranjan at the time
 deepak singhl ne alok ranjan jo unase pehle mukhya sachiv the, unhen bhi tokate hue kaha tha ki salaahkaar mahoday salaah baad main den
 In another function, Deepak Singhal had said that Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav has children from both heart and mind
 singhl ke bartaav se CM the khafamukhya sachiv banane ke baad deepak singhl jis tarah duusare adhikariyon se bartaav kar rahe the or unhen dhamka rahe the, uski bhi shikaayatein lagaataar mukhyamantri ko mil rahi thim
 It is also being said that the way the High Court ordered a CBI inquiry on mining in Uttar Pradesh and the government could not properly advocate in its court
 usase bhi mukhyamantri khafa hue
 According to heavy sources, Amar Singh had to go to the party, the real reason was the involvement of Deepak Singhal in Amar Singh's party in Delhi on Sunday
 is party main mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav nahin gaye the
 Sometime back, Amar Singh said many things against Akhilesh Yadav
 uske baavjood apane mukhya sachiv kaa amar singh kii party main janaa mukhyamantri ko bilkul pasand nahin aayaa hoga
 Singhal, who is considered to be special to the Governor, Akhilesh Yadav, who is trying to improve the image of his government, on Monday dismissed his two cabinet ministers, Prajapati and Raj Kishore Singh, because they were accused of corruption
 mukhya sachiv banane ke liye deepak singhl ne mulaayam singh or shivpal yadav ke darbar main kai chakkar lagaae the
 Deepak Singhal is considered to be special of Shivpal Yadav
 kaumi ekta dal ko lekar shivpal yadav se akhilesh yadav kii khinchataan pehle se hi chal rahi he
 In such a situation, the sacrifice of the close officer of Shivpal Yadav on the day of Bakrid will be looked at by the people who feed on the Samajwadi Party and the UP government
 bijepi media cell ne ravivaar ko party ke sabhi rashtriya evam rajyon ke pravaktaaon or television dibet main jane vaale tivi penlists ke liye ek kaaryshaala yojit kii
 In this, BJP national president Amit Shah aggressively asked for the three-year achievements of the central government to be taken aggressively among the public
 saath hibijepi adhyaksh shahne modi sarkaar ke kaamon or yojanaon ko behatar tareeke se janata tak pahunchane ke tips die
 Shah Nassaf said in words that the party spokespersons have the most responsibility to explain the good work that the Modi government is doing for the people in an easy manner
 shah ne modi sarkaar kii kuch yojanaon kaa udhaaharan dete hue sabhi pravaktaaon ko nirdesh diya ki jiesti se hone vaale faayde ke liye jan-jan ko jaagruk karen
 He told the spokesmen that whether it is Ujjwala Yojana or Jan Dhan Yojana or Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, the responsibility of promoting everyone is with the government
 bijepi adhyakshane kaha ki congress sarkaar ke dauraan vikaas or aarthik morche par jo gadde the, usko thos kadam uthaakar modi sarkaar ne na sirf bharaa, balki vahaan vikaas kii minar khadi kar rahi he
 Piyush Goyal also gave a presentation on the improvement in the power sector in the country
 is dauraan kendriya mantri ravishankar prasad ne bataaya ki kisi prakaar se tivi dibet main jane se pehle jo bhi mudda ho, usase sambandhit maamle research karke janaa chahie
 Always keep updated with the latest case information
 hyderabad kighatana ne puure desh ko jhakzor kar rakh diya he
 Since this incident, questions have started to be raised once again on the safety of women in the country
 itnaa hi nahin, deshbhar main is mudde ko lekar kaaphi aakrosh he
 People are agitating for the punishment of the accused at different places
 haal hi main mahila suraksha ko lekar bollywood actor farhaan akhtar (farhan Akhtar) ne bhi twit kiya he
 In this tweet, he said that if political parties can ensure the safety of women, then it will be very difficult to defeat them
 farhaan akhtar kaa yah twit soshal media par khub dhyaan khinch rahaa he
 At the same time, people are giving fiercely their reaction to this
 i think that any political party that can ensure the safety of women (not just pay lip service) will be hard to defeat electorally
 For one, they'll surely have half the electorate supporting them
 Second, if their concern is genuine, their inherent values can't be wrong
 Farhan Akhtar wrote in his tweet linking women safety and political parties to this, "I believe any political party that ensures the safety of women (not just by words) is electively defeated
 It will be difficult to get
 pehle to, nishchit rup se unka samarthan karne vaale aadhe matadaata honge
 Second, if their concern is genuine then their inherent value can never be wrong
 " mahilaon or rajnatik dalon par aayaa farhaan akhtar kaa yah twit khub surkhiyaan bator rahaa he
 Talking about the work front, Farhan Akhtar was last seen in the film The Sky Is Pink
 is film main unke saath actress priyanka chopra (priyanka Chopra), jaayra wasim or actor rohit saraaf bhi najar aae the
 Apart from this, Farhan Akhtar is also going to be seen in 'toofan' soon

 Playing the last match on the home pitch, Rajasthan has climbed two places in the score table and is just two points behind the top Chennai
 chennai par behatar ran rate se jeet darj kar jahaan rajasthan sheersh par pahunch sakati he vahiin chennai kii jeet kii aadat ko khatm karnaa itnaa aasaan nahin he
 In this edition of IPL, till now only one time Mumbai Indians have made a dent in the fort of Rajasthan Royals
 royles ab apane kile main kisi or send na lagane dene ke liye puraa jor lagaaegi
 Rajasthan Royals have done extremely well in chasing the target
 unki pichhali donon jeet shandaar thi
 While Chennai Super Kings have emerged as brilliant defenders
 donon tiimon ke ballebaaj kaaphi shandaar farm main hai, lekin mohit sharma kii aakraamak shuruyaat chennai ko gendbaaji main rajasthan se behatar banaati he
 Ravichandran Ashwin and Dwayne Bravo are bowling well in the middle overs
 chennai super kings kii sabase badi takat hai uske captain mahendra sih dhoni, jo apane khilaadiyon se unka sarvshereshth nikalwane main kaamyaab hue hai
 Dhoni has not only made his team win the habit but also emerges himself as a troubleshooter in difficult times
 rajasthan royles kii jeet kii chaabi isi baat main he ki wo chennai super kings ke ran barasaane vaale ballebaajon ko kitni giraft main rakh pate hai
 The way he overcame himself after losing badly to the Mumbai Indians, after that Chennai Super Kings look even more dangerous
 tippaniyan Rajasthan will have to overcome big hurdlers like Michael Hussey, Suresh Raina and captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni to win over Chennai
 iske saath hi james foxnar, ajit chandila, keven kupar or shen watasan ko gendbaaji main bhi behtareen pradarshan karnaa hoga, tabhi rajasthan jeet darj karne main safal ho sakati he
 Overall, this match is expected to be very interesting

 While Rajasthan can reach the top by winning with a better run rate over Chennai, it is not so easy to end the winning habit of Chennai

 jabaki chennai super kings shandaar rakshak ke rup main ubhari he
 The batsmen of both teams are in excellent form, but Mohit Sharma's aggressive start makes Chennai better than Rajasthan in bowling
 vahiin ravichandran aswin or dwen braavo bich ke overon main acchhee gendbaaji kar rahe hai
 The biggest strength of Chennai Super Kings is its captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who has managed to get his best out of his players
 dhoni na sirf apni team ko jeet kii aadat dalava chuke hai balki kathin samay main khud bhi sankatmochak banakar ubharate hai
 The key to the victory of Rajasthan Royals is in how much they can keep the batsmen of Chennai Super Kings scoring runs
 jis tarah se unhone mubai indiens se buree tarah haarane ke baad khud ko ubaara, uske baad to chennai super kings or bhi khatarnaak najar aa rahi he
 The comments rajasthan ko chennai par jeet darj karne ke liye maaikel hasi, suresh raina or captain mahendra singh dhoni jaise bade avarodhakon se paar paanaa hoga
 Along with this, James Foakner, Ajit Chandila, Kaven Cooper and Shane Watson will also have to perform well in bowling, only then Rajasthan can be successful in winning

 uttar pradesh ke barabanki jile se dilli aakar jawaharlal nehru vishvavidhyalay main emphil kar raheen sonam maurya apni padhai ko lekar phikrmand hai
 In fact, in October last year, the University Grants Commission (UGC) in its meeting decided to discontinue the non-net fellowship awarded to research students
 sonam kahati hai, “non-net fellowship kaaphi kam or der se milti he, us par ise band karne kaa faisla jaruratmand chaatr-chaatraon ke liye raste band karne kii tarah he
 However, after this decision, students from universities across the country performed vigorously in Delhi under the Occupy UGC campaign
 isamen biechayu se lekar, elahabaad, patna, hyderabad, punjab, rajasthan samet dilli ke jeenyu, jamiya millia or diu ke chaatr bhi shaamil the
 Along with repealing the decision, he also sought to increase the amount of non-net fellowship
 november ke pehle hafte main apane ghar ke saamne pradarshan kar rahe chaatr-chaatraon se maanav sansaadhav vikaas mantri smriti irani ne kaha tha ki non-net fellowship ko roka nahin jayega or isaki samiksha kii jaaegi
 a committee was also constituted for this and its meetings were said to be held in December last year and again in January 2016
 lekin ab tak isko lekar kisi bhi tarah kii baithak nahin hui he
 Non-net fellowships are awarded to students from central universities and some other important institutions of the country who have not passed NET-JRF or who are deprived of fellowship to needy students under various categories
 inamen adhiktar net (neshnal eligibility test) uteern chaatr hote hai
 Around 3,200 mphil and phd students get net-jrf fellowship, under which Rs 25,000 per month
 milte hai
 At the same time, under non-net fellowship, mphil students get Rs 5,000
 or piechdi chaatro ko 8,000 ru
 See you every month
 ujisi ke purv sadsy yogendra yadav bataate hai ki ujisi yah aankada nahin jaahir karata lekin kareeb 25,000 se zyada chaatr-chaatraon ko non-net fellowship milti he
 He says, “the issue of Occupy UGC or University of Hyderabad, students have been agitating since a long time
 yah nai chetana kaa sanket he or aane vaale dinon main yah chinagaari koi bada swaroop le sakati he
 According to Yadav, the issue of recent non-net fellowship has also raised the need for such fellowship in the education system
 kareeb teen maah baad bhi ocupai ujisi abhiyaan jari he
 The JNU students' union president Kanhaiya also wants to witness the widespread siege of students regarding this fellowship, "we are currently running a signature campaign in universities across the country and until the government decides in the interest of students, We are not going to stop

 ucchtam nyaayalay ne 10 disambar ko haryana sarkaar ke panchayat raaj kanoon main kiye gaye sanshodhano ko hari jhandi di to do jajon kii bench main shaamil justise abhaya manohar sapre ne faisle ke saath khud ko sambhddha karte hue alag se kuch vichaar rakhe
 Not considering the mandatory condition of having toilets in the house for contesting panchayat elections as a violation of the constitution, Justice Sapre commented, "time is right that instead of limiting it in one state in the public interest, it should be ensured that it is applicable throughout the country Ho
 ”supreme court kaa yah faisla haryana sarkaar kii ore se panchayat raaj kanoon main laae gaye sanshodhano ko di gai chunauti ke baad aayaa he
 Within a week of ending the deadlock over the panchayat elections, the Haryana government has announced new election dates
 yani ab panchayat chunaav ladgaye ke liye paanch nai sharten lagu hongi&kisi bhi aparaadh main 10 saal yaa usase zyada sajaa paane vaala, sahakaari sanstha, bank aadi se karj lekar difolter ghoshit he or bijli kaa bill bakaayaa ho to chunaav nahin lard saktaa
 Whereas in terms of educational qualification, general category people must have 10th pass, 8th pass for women, 8th pass for SC class, 5th pass of SC women for Panch and most importantly, it is compulsory to have running toilet in candidate's house The condition has been added
 iske liye haryana sarkaar ne sabase pehle agast main adhyadesh ke jariye panchayat raaj kanoon 1994 main sanshodhan kar diya tha, jis par hycourt ne 19 agast ko roak laga di
 After this, the Manohar Lal Khattar government of the state withdrew the ordinance and passed the Panchayati Raj Amendment Bill 2015 from the Legislative Assembly on September 7 and the Panchayat elections were announced the next day
 lekin chunavi prakriya shuru hone kaa hawala dete hue hycourt ne dakhal se inkaar kar diya, jiske baad 14 sitambar ko rajbala, kamalesh or preet singh kii ore se supreme court main yachika daayar kii gai or 17 sitambar ko court ne in sanshodhano par roak laga di
 After this, the Khattar government sought time to present its stand in the court and on 22 September, panchayat elections were banned
 do maheene kii bahes ke baad supreme court ne 10 disambar ko apana faisla sunaate hue haryana sarkaar ke paanchon sanshodhano ko uchit tehraaya
 But the way in which legal and political debate has started on this decision, it can be seen in the times to come
 sabase ahm sawaal yah uth rahaa he ki jab desh-rajya ke liye kanoon banane waalon par is tarah kii pabandi nahin he to sarpanch par kyon
 The challengers in the court had also said in their arguments that this would make 64 percent of the rural population of Haryana bereft of the court
 chunaav ladgaye ke faisle par sidhi tippanee karne kii bajaae yachikakartaon ke vakil vikram mittal ne india today se kaha, “court ne apane faisle main sanshodhano ko bhale jaij tehraaya ho, lekin shiksha ko lekar rajya sarkaar kii javabdehi tay karne kii koi charchaa nahin he jabaki haryana ke 50 fisadi se zyada gaanvon main dasvin tak kaa bhi skool nahin he
 Recognizing the verdict as flawed, the petitioners are strategizing to file a review petition in the court
 supreme court main vakil indira jaisingh to ise swasth bhartiya loktantr ko gaharaa jhatka qaraar detii hai
 On the need for toilets to contest the elections, he said, "it seems that the message of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan has reached the country, it has penetrated so deeply in the court that the court itself became its special brand ambassador
 ” supreme court ke hi ek anya vakil viraag gupta is faisle ko sanvaidhanik sankat ke rup main dekhte hai
 He says, "the arbitrary interpretation of the constitutional provisions at the state level threatens not only federalism in the country but also the rule of law
 aise kanoonon kii shuruyaat vidhayakon-saansadon se ho tabhi gavarnence ke masale hal honge or loktantr swasth hoga
 "he says that just as the" Poor Hatao "campaign started after the failure of the former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's" Garibi Hatao "campaign, the BJP came to power on the slogan of" Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas "
 If it is not able to succeed, then such forced law has been imposed
 is faisle ko lekar kanoonee nuktachini hi nahin, rajnatik bahes bhi apane charam par he
 Leader of Opposition in Haryana Legislative Assembly Abhay Singh Chautala says, "when an illiterate President, Prime Minister, Chief Minister, Minister in the country can become, then why not a sarpanch?" BJP will have to bear the brunt of this decision
 agar use lagata he ki yah faisla janhit main liya gaya he to party apane chunaav chinh par panchayat chunaav lard le, hakeekat kaa andaja lag jayega
 "but the National General Secretary of Haryana BJP, Dr
 anil jain kehete hai, “samvidhan kii vyakhya karne vaali sabase badi sanstha supreme court he or hamen uski bhaawanaaon ke mutabik chalanaa chahie
 Anyway, when such an election reform initiative takes place, questions arise, but later everyone adores it
 ” lekin saansad-vidhayak ke chunaav ladgaye par yah shart kyon nahin? jain kehete hai, “abhi bahes shuru hui he
 We do not say that this should not be done for mps-mlas
 lekin yah bhi tathy he ki sarpanch check par dastakhat karte hai, saansad-vidhayak nahin
 Therefore, if the initiative for electoral reform takes place at the panchayat level, then good changes can be brought
 ”ve bataate hai ki abhi ise haryana, rajasthan ne lagu kiya he, anya bijepi shasit rajya bhi ise apana sakate hai
 But Congress leader and former Union Panchayati Raj Minister Mani Shankar Aiyar has publicly demanded the intervention of Parliament, calling the decision a setback to justice
 unki daleel he, “haryana sarkaar kaa faisla mahila, obisi, essi-asti virdohi he
 "panchayat elections are to be held in Bihar in the coming time, but the general secretary of the ruling party JD (U) there
 si
 Tyagi calls it against the basic spirit of the Constitution
 ve kehete hai, “yah galat faisla he, gaanv or kamjor tabakon ke saath jyaadati he
 If there is illiteracy in the country or the toilets are not built, then the government is to blame
 haryana sarkaar gaanv ke logon ko unke moulik adhikaar se vanchit karnaa chaahati he
 The panchayat in the village does justice and many issues are resolved on the basis of collectivity, for which educational qualification is not required
 ” ve is masale ko sansad main uthaane kaa elaan karte hue supreme court ko bhi naseehat dete hai, “ samvidhan abhijaat” varg ke liye nahin bana he, adaalat is faisle par punarvichaar kare or aise maamalon main faisla dete vakt use samvidhan kii bhaawanaaon ko bhi dhyaan main rakhana chahie
 "well, in the legal-political Mahabharata that has sprung up on this decision, the BJP may feel a bit relaxed with the Samajwadi Party's tone
 sapa ke rashtriya mahasachiv naresh agarwal kehete hai, “supreme court kah chukaa he to vichaar karnaa chahie
 Panchayat elections have been held in UP
 agali baar jab chunaav hon to sarkaar ko is par vichaar karnaa chahie kyonki nirakshar logon ko kaam karne main dikkat aati he
 After the Supreme Court's decision, the debate to end criminalization of elections and politics will start again and there will be a demand to implement it to Parliament instead of limiting it to panchayat

 har poling centre par sakht suraksha vyavastha
 When the news of Ponty and Hardeep Chaddha being killed for the first time came out from the farmhouse in South Delhi, the story was clear that the two brothers shot each other in a land dispute
 lekin jaanch jaise-jaise aage badi, maut kii yah kahani ulajhati chali gai
 The biggest reason for doubt was how Ponty would have fired bullets with just three fingers
 doosraa sawaal postmortem report main aae us tathy se khadaa ho gaya jisamen kaha gaya ki ponti ko goliyaan thodi dur se maari gayi, jabaki hardip ko kaaphi paas se goliyaan maari gayi
 That is, if two men are shooting each other, then why did the bullets not move from an equal distance
 hatyakand par sabase bada sawaal uthaa sukhdev singh namdhari kii maujuudagi par
 Namdhari is considered close to Ponty and has a long criminal record
 hatyakand ke samay tak ve uttarakhand alpsankhyak ayog ke adhyaksh the
 He was later removed from the post
 is hatyakand main ponti kii taraf se report namdhari ne hi likhaai thi, lekin dilli police ne unhen bhi apni poochtacha ke daayre main liya
 The news came in the middle that Namdhari has been escaping from the police, but after three days of silence Namdhari said that he has not run anywhere and is ready to cooperate with the police investigation
 darasal vaardaat vaale din jab ponti chaddha farmahouse par pahunche to unke saath namdhari or namdhari kaa suraksha guard tha
 Ponty did not have his own security guard, while he always drove with his personal security staff
 namdhari kii ore se police main likhavai gai report main kaha gaya ki unke suraksha guard ne ponti ke bachaav main goliyaan chalaayin
 But when the guards were firing from both sides, why did the death of the two brothers only? Arrested in the massacre and the arrest of five people on the charge of firing has repeatedly raised the question that there is a third man behind the murder
 Is not
 khaskar jab yah kayaas lagaae jate hon ki ponti kaa istemaal kai netaaon ke kaale dhan ko safed karne main kiya ja rahaa tha
 On the other hand, after the murder of the two brothers, the entire Chadha family is embroiled in the manner in which the Chadha family has shown solidarity and has not made any comment about the quarrel
 shaayad isiilie dilli police hatyakand ke silsile main ab tak 100 se zyada logon se poochtacha kar chuki he
 According to the police investigation, Hardeep k 0 in this homicide
 3 smith and vesan pistal kaa prayog hua
 Apart from this, the security guard of Namdhari had SAF carbine
 chaddha bandhuon ko punjab police ne jo surakshakarmi muhaiyaa karaae the unke paas chaar karbaine or teen eke 47 rifl or ek 9 mem kii pistal thi
 Police are sending all these weapons for forensic investigation to find out from which weapon the bullets were fired
 hathiyaaron kaa itnaa bada jakhira, chaddha bandhuon kii akut daulat kaa jhagada or siyasat kaa badalata rangarup hatyakand ko jasusi kathaon jaisaa bana rahaa he
 It will be known if the Chadha brothers were the pawn or the players in this bloody game

 jyotish main teen rashiyaan agni tatv kii rashiyaan maani jaati hai
 These zodiac signs are Aries Leo and Dhanu
 in raashiyon ke andar urja or agni kaaphi maatra main hoti he
 Sun is most important for these zodiac signs
 ye rashiyaan saahas netritv or krodh kii rashiyaan maani jaati hai
 The first sign of fire element - Aries - Lord of this sign is Mars - Sun's most loved sign - Energy, courage, newness and versatility are found in this sign
the biggest weakness of this sign is - Unsteady mind - They should wear a pearl after taking advice - Sun must be worshiped
 The second sign of fire element - Leo - The lord of this sign is the Sun itself - This sign is considered to be the main sign of the fire element
 -this sign is considered to be the amount of leadership, courage, struggle and politics- People of this zodiac often lead the society- The biggest weakness of this zodiac is- Overconfidence- They should be advised
 You should wear a coral - People of this zodiac should chant the Gayatri Mantra
 The third zodiac of fire element - Dhanu - the lord of this zodiac is Jupiter - here the sun makes a person fortunate - this zodiac possesses courage, knowledge, calculation and Leadership has a gun - People of this zodiac are often seen in the army or police - their biggest weakness is - not to control the voice - People of this zodiac should take advice and wear rubies Should- People of this zodiac must worship Lord Sun emsidi chunaav ke ain pehle dilli bijepi ne apane maujuuda parshadon ke tikat kaatane kaa faisla kiya he
 An emergency meeting of councilors was called and at this meeting, the councilors were ordered to cut their tickets
 baithak main maujuud parshadon ke liye ye elaan thik vaisaa hi tha, jaisaa ki notebandi ke liye piem narendra modi ne kiya tha
 It was also said that by making a sudden decision to cut the ticket of the current councilors, Delhi BJP President Manoj Tiwari has used the demonetization formula in the municipal elections
 is faisle ke baad log ab chutki bhi le rahe hai ki bijepi ke maujuuda parshadon kii haalat thik waisi hi ho gai he, jaisi kinotbandi ke baad hajaar or paanch sauke note kii hui thi
 Because there are many councilors in the Municipal Corporation, who are not only experienced but also have their own base
 lekin party ke faisle ke baad unka anubhav or janaadhar kisi kaam kaa nahin bachaa
 The party ended up giving him a ticket
 aise main paanch sau or hajaar ke note kii tarah party main chunaav se pehle unki puch-parakh to bani rahegi, lekin wo chunaav nahin lard paaenge
 Many councilors have been Todas and elected members of the Municipal Corporation of Delhi for fifteen years, in such a situation, the sudden decision of the party has not only washed away the preparations for the upcoming election, but also on the hopes of many veterans running the ticket
 Have given
 teenon emsidi main milakar bijepi ke paas philhal 155 parshad hai, jinamein se ab party ke faisle ke mutabik kisi ko bhi tikat nahin milegaa, aise main party ke bheetar aane vaale dinon main andruni kalah kii ashanka se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Taking a dig at Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis for the 'make in India' week that started in Mumbai, the Shiv Sena said that Maharashtra has so far failed to attract so much investment, which would at least compensate for the Chief Minister's foreign travel expenses

 ye aatmavishvaas nahin, janata se mili takat he
 In the 'panchayat Aajatak' program, Shivraj said that he had a dilapidated Madhya Pradesh inherited from the Congress, but his tenure saw rapid growth and the state's economic achievement is nothing short of a miracle
 jab shivaraj se poocha gaya ki vipaksh kah rahaa he ki is baar unke paas vaapasi kaa behatar mauka he

 ’’ Lashkar terrorist Mohammad Amir has once again exposed the lies of Pakistan
 mahaj 18 saal kii umr kaa yah aatanki karachi, pakistan kaa rahane vaala he
 The special thing is that this terrorist who came from the Indian Army has taken training of terrorists like Hafiz and Lakhvi from the academy
 ajtak ne liya he aatank ke khilaadi kaa khaas intervyuu, joatankwadaka stadium ban chuke pakistan ke chakke chhudaa degaa
 In the interview given to Aaj Tak, this player of terror, one after the other, bounces bouncers at Pakistan
 usase batch paanaa aatankwaadiyon ke head coach pakistan ke liye bhi mushkil ho jayega
 People are stunned to hear the live and exclusive running commentary of the Pakistani player on Aaj Tak
 pakistan kii teror menuphaccharing industry se nikle is jinda aatanki ke on camera kaboolname ne us teror team kii puri pole khol di he
 The Pakistan government is headed by the vice-captain, the army for which the wicketkeeping ISI does and which has players like hafiz-lakhvi-masood Azhar
 is jinda aatanki ne silsilewar bataaya ki kaise hafiz-lakhvi ke gurukool main dehshatgardi ke sampole taiyaar kiye jate hai
 And how the conspiracy to entrap the needy struggling with poverty and poverty into the tramp of terror
 ye ladkaa pakistan kii ankhon dekhi asaliyat sabake saamne bataa rahaa he
 Its full name is Mohammad Amir alias Abu Hamas
 isaki umr abhi 18 saal he
 And its address is house number-776, street number-14, mohalla-power house, Mahazar Camp, Karachi, Pakistan
 ye ladka karachi main kabad bechata tha
 The father was ill
 6 bhai-bahanon kaa bada parivaar tha
 Hands were empty, there was responsibility on the head
 aatank kii factory ke liye isse behatar kaccha maal or kya ho saktaa tha
 The Lashkar recruitment unit operating in Karachi started the work of trapping it
 is ladke ke mutabik use lashkar ke aatankiyon ne 4 hajaar rupee die
 After this, the story of making an 18-year-old boy a fighter at the Learning Institute of hafiz-lakhvi started
 pehle jarurmanton ko fande main lenaa
 Then it is the job of Lashkar to fill his mind with the opium of hate in the name of Islam and to give him a high level of bloodshed when his mind is fisted, for which such boys are sent to training bases
 is aatanki ladke ne suraksha agenciyon ke saamne lashkar ke training course kii puri detail bak di
 How it was taught to run an AK-47
 kaise hafiz said-lakhvi ke nafrat bhare bhaashan suna-sunaakar iske dimag ko sunn kiya gaya
 Alive terrorists told much more and after hearing this you will come to the conclusion that the process of wicket-taking of terrorists in the Kashmir Valley will have to continue because as long as the training center of enemies like hafiz-lakhvi is safe, terror is not possible to be eliminated from Kashmir
 
 aapke liye ye jaananaa jaruri he ki kashmir main aatank kii fasal lagane ke liye pakistan kii hukumat or uske kaise jaruratmand naujavaanon ko fansaate hai
 They put the seeds of hate in their minds
 training camp main is aatanki ko puri tarah rangarut main dhaal diya gaya
 Training to run from bomb to AK-47 was given
 iske dimag main bharat ke khilaaf nafrat thuns di gai
 This living terrorist told the truth about the unholy alliance of devils like Pakistani government, ISI and hafiz-lakhvi, which Pakistan knows but does not believe
 isane iesai ke bare main bhi khulaasa kiya or aatankiyon kii madadgaar pakistani sena ke bare main bhi bataaya
 He told how the terrorists are given cover firing during the infiltration so that our jawans can be confounded
 is aatanki ko bhi puri taiyaari ke saath bheja gaya tha
 With all the goods through which it can get its feet in India
 lekin ye aatanki sena ke hathe chadh gaya
 This terrorist has told so much detail that it is clear that a large network of terrorists imported from Pakistan is working in Kashmir
 un sabko pakistan se hukum miltaa he
 Kasab first and now this terrorist alive

 jharkhand ke bahucharchit farji naksal sarender maamle kii file police vibhaag ne band kar di he
 It is alleged that in 2014, 514 students were surrendered in the form of Naxalites in a fake way through the referent institute
 puure prakaran main police or prashasan ke adhikariyon ke shaamil hone kii baat bhi saamne ai thi
 During the investigation, the top officials had also found that only 10 of these youths were related to Naxalite activities, but the way the institute itself closed the file of the investigation by claiming five people as accused, it has raised many questions
 
 farjivade tak simati rahi jaanchamaamale main police adhikariyon ke shaamil hone kii baat saamne aane ke baavjood jaanch sirf naukari ke naam par farjivade tak simati rahi
 They are accused that the game took place in the name of investigation and the authorities were rescued
 is maamle main rashtriya maanavadhikaar ayog kii report par bhi gaur nahin kiya jisamen kaha gaya tha ki police ke bade adhikariyon ne sarender kaa aankada badhaane ke liye sarender policy kaa durupyog kiya
 The police took statement from just 128 of the surrender youths
 inamen adhikansh ke pate kaa police yaa to satyaapan hi nahin kar pai yaa phir ve in paton par nahin mili
 Investigation report of the case has been submitted, in which only five nominees have been convicted and all of them have been associated with the referent institute
 kya he maamla?jharkhand sahit desh ke duusare rajyon main naksaliyon ko raashtra kii mukhya dhara main shaamil karne ke liye sarender kaarykram chalaae ja rahe hai
 Under this, the Jharkhand Police enlisted the help of a man named Ravi Bodra
 ravi ke bare main jaanch report main bataaya gaya he ki vah sena main kar chukaa he or vahaan se ritair hone ke baad vah military itanlijes se jud gaya tha
 Ravi Bodra had camped in Naxalite affected districts like Ranchi, Gumla, Khuti, Simdega and suggested to the youth to surrender with weapons under surrender policy
 aise main siarpief or sena main naukari paane ke laalach me gaanv ke yuvakon ne jameen or motorcycle bechakar ravi or dinesh prajapati ko paise die
 Both had told the youths that they would get a job only if they surrendered as Naxalites
 baad main sabhi yuvakon ko puraane jail main rakhaa gaya
 The police investigation was approved after the case surfaced
 vaise ranchi police ne jo jaanch kii usamen yah kaha gaya he ki ravi, dinesh prajapati ke saath bade afasaron ke rishton kii jaanch nahin kii gai
 After the fake surrender of these 514 youths, they were kept under the supervision of CRPF
 hairaani kii baat yah rahi ki sarender ke baad kisi bhi yuvak ko court main pesh hi nahin kiya gaya tha
 The Human Rights Commission also blamed the police officers for keeping the youths like this
 vaise police ne bhale hi file band kar di ho lekin yah maamla abhi hoicourt main lambit he
 Congress leader in Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad has attacked BJP to save MP Pragya Singh Thakur
 gulam nabi aaazaad ne kaha ki ek ore to bijepi gandhi ji ke janm kii 150veen jayanti manaane ja rahi he, lekin saath hi jis shaks ne saarvajanik rup se baapu ke hatyare kii tarif kii uske khilaaf koi karrwai nahin kii ja rahi he
 How is this possible, and how can anyone defend it
 gulam nabi aaazaad ne kaha, "is saal ham baapu kaa 150waan janmdin manaa rahe hai, ye gaurav kii baat he
 
 
 At the same time, i regret that the year we are celebrating Bapu's 150th birth anniversary, the same year some mps from the ruling party are coming, who are praising Gandhi's killers
 
 
 ek candidet ne kaha ki jis shaks ne baapu ko maaraa wo deshbhakt tha
 
 
 Repeating that word will burn my tongue
 bijepi kaa candidet ye kahe ki gandhi ko maarane vaala deshbhakt tha
 
 
 i have a complaint to Prime Minister Narendra Modi that you should have dismissed him from the party at that time
 
 
 or kahana chahie tha ki ye hamaara candidet nahin he
 "please tell that Azad was referring to Sadhvi Pragya, MP elected from Bhopal in Madhya Pradesh
 sadhvi ne congress ke ummidavaar digvijay singh ko maat di he
 It made a controversial statement during the Lok Sabha elections
 is bayaan ke baad pradhanmantri narendra modi ne kaha tha ki vah aisa bayaan dene waalon ko kabhi man se maaf nahin kar paaenge
 Azad narrated the story of Nehru in the Rajya Sabha After this, Ghulam Nabi Azad narrated a story related to Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru
 aaazaad ne kaha ki 1952 main nehru vidhansabha ke ek candidet ke liye prachaar ke liye pahunche
 When Nehru reached the venue, the District Congress President said that the wrong person got the ticket from here, there are some allegations on this person
 iske baad pandit nehru ne kaha ki kya is vidhansabha kshetra se koi aisa nirdaleey candidet he jisaki chhavi saaf suthere netaa kii ho, is par unhen bataaya gaya ki haa aisa ek ummidavaar he
 After this, when Nehru came to give a speech on the stage, he said that he had come to ask for votes for the Congress candidate, but he came to know some things about that candidate which are not right
 isliye aap is nirdaleey ummidavaar ko vot dijie
 Ghulam Nabi Azad said that people were so impressed by Nehru's cleanliness that he voted for that independent candidate and he also won
 piem se bhi thi nehru jaisi ummidagulam nabi aaazaad ne kaha ki unhen pradhanmantri narendra se aisi hi ummid thi
 He said that Gandhiji was the president of the Congress, but he was also the father of the nation
 is rashtrapita ke hatyare ko deshbhakt kehane vaale shaks par koi karrwai na ho
 
 
 What can be said on this gulam nabi aaazaad ne kaha ki bijepi ke paas abhi bhi mauka he ki wo is par 2 oktober se pehle karrwai kare, nahin to ye daag sattadhari party par hameshaa laga rahegaa

 In fact, on 3 December, Utkarsh Tathagata, son of Sushil Kumar Modi, was married in Patna and Tej Pratap Yadav also congratulated the newly married couple through the media
 isi dauraan media ke ek sawaal par tej pratap yadav ne khud ke liye dulhaniya dhundne kii jimmedaari susheel modi ko de di
 Tej Pratap said that Sushil Modi is old and old, so he should find a bride for him
 24 ghante ke andar susheel modi ne bheetej pratapaka jawaab diya or kaha ki vah unke liye dulhaniya dhund lenge basharte vah unki teen shart ko maan len
 The first is that he will not take dowry, the second is that he will resolve to donate organ and thirdly that Tej Pratap will not go and sabotage the marriage of others
 susheel modi ke in sharton kaa bheetej pratap yadavane kuch hi ghanton ke andar twitor ke jariye jawaab de diya lekin apane jawaab ke jariye tej pratap ne mukhyamantri nitish kumaar par jamkar nishaanaa saadhaa
 Tej Pratap said through Twitter that he accepted all the terms of Sushil Uncle's marriage, but he has a condition of his own
 tej pratap ne susheel modi ke saamne yah shart rakhi ki unhen dhokhaa dene vaali dulhaniya nahin chahie

 Teasing on Nitish and Sushil Modi, Tej Pratap said that in the same way that Sushil Modi has betrayed the mandate, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar is the groom of the new alliance, in the same way, he should not be a cheating bride

 JNU alumni association president Kanhaiya Kumar is contesting from this seat on a CPI ticket
 unke saamne bijepi ke fire brands netaa giriraaj singh hai
 Kanhaiya tweeted on Giriraj on Tuesday morning

 This tweet of Kanhaiya has been going viral since morning

 giriraaj kaa kahana he ki vah party ke netritv se naaraaz hai
 He has asked why my seat was changed from Nawada to Begusarai, although he also said that since 1996 he wanted to contest from here
 unhone kaha ki mujhe is baat kaa dukh he ki mujhase bina puche meri seat badal di gai
 Significantly, since it has been decided that the battle in Begusarai is going to be Kanhaiya Kumar vs Giriraj Singh, the thrill is here at the peak
 kanhaiya kumaar bhi lagaataar giriraaj par sakht bayaan de rahe hai
 Recently he said that his fight is not directly with Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) but directly with Giriraj Singh
 pehle aisi ummid jataai ja rahi thi ki kanhaiya kumaar begusarai se mahagathbandhan ke sanyukt ummidavaar ban sakate hai, lekin aisa nahin hua mahagathbandhan ne sipiai ko jagah nahin di

 bijepi ko to bolne kaa mauka chahie lekin jis amethi main ek bhi salike kaa hotel nahin vahaan rahul gandhi kii riyaaya ke liye bharat sarkaar kaa ek vishaal management institute khol diya tha
 You may ask, where is your share in this democracy of progress? hariyaali teej 2018 India lost to New Zealand in the T20 World Cup on Tuesday
 kya ise bharat mata kii haar kah sakate hai? bharat or bharat mata main kya antar he? jo sarkaar is desh par hukumat karti he, vah bharat kii sarkaar he yaa bharat mata kii? jab ham is sawaal ke bheetar utarate hai, tab pate hai ki desh ko lekar thopi hui ek avadharana darasal hamen kuch or bana rahi he
 We are working to hide our failures by creating an imaginary idol of Bharat Mata, instead of concretely understanding our India, battling its problems and its crises
 beshak, bharat kii hamaari kalpana main ek bharat mata bhi honi chahie
 The country is not just a map of paper
 uske saath hamaara ek bhavuk rishta hota he
 Because if India is not a mother, then India will be the name of a dry geography, not of the music playing in our veins, not of the rhyme on our lips, not of the blood running in our veins
 lekin yah samajhnaa zaruri he ki bharat mata kaa baar-baar naam lekar ham na bharat mata kaa sammaan badhaate hai na bharat kii shakti
 This is the same as how we ignore Mahatma Gandhi's suggested way of punctuality or truth or non-violence, and daily call him Bapu or President
 isse mahatma gandhi kii izzat badhati nahin, kuch kam hi hoti he
 This is also the case of Bharat or Mother India
 jab ham ek sahishnu loktantr hote hai, to desh bada lagata he
 When we appear to be a staunch society, the country becomes smaller
 jab ham dangon main koon bahaate hai, to bharat mata sharminda hoti he, jab ham baadh or tsunami main logon kii jaan bachaate hai, to bharat mata kii izzat badhati he
 But this thick and idealistic understanding must be held by all of us
 vah hoti kyon nahin? kyonki ham bharat or bharat mata kaa naam jitna bhi len, ise thik se samajhate nahin
 We all have our own India
 bahut saare logon ko malaal he ki 1947 ke vibhaajan ke baad bharat ko hindu raashtra kyon nahin ghoshit kiya gaya
 They felt that the purpose of partition was to create two nations, one of which would be Hindu and the other one to be Muslim, while in the midst of all the irony and agony of partition, the Indian state of the nation believed that Pakistan should make its nation based on good religion
 , But India will remain the country of all those who agree to live together without any discrimination of religion and caste
 yah vah imtihaan tha, jo vibhaajan ke baad ke varshon main bahut kadaa tha - kyonki sarhad ke donon taraf koon kii nadiyaan bah rahi thim - lekin hindustan yah imtihaan jitkar niklaa - usne apana badppan sabit kiya
 But there are still many examinations of India, India or Mother India
 samvidhan ne sabko raajnneetik barabari di or saamaajik barabari kaa sapana diya, lekin yah barabari ab tak sapana bani hui he
 Many other people are sorry that due to democracy, everyone got equal vote and 'raja' and 'parja' became one
 bhartiya raashtra rajya multah agadon kaa tantra he
 Caste remains in the social life and marriages are still largely within the caste hierarchy
 jo saamaajik gairbarabari he, vah aarthik str par or zyaada alanghy hoti gai he
 Very large India is disappointed with its ruling
 sarkarein badal rahi hai, lekin yah nazar aata he ki modi or manmohan main, chidambaram or jetali main arthniti ke str par koi buniyadi fark nahin he
 The difference in social thinking is also that the communal card that the Congress kept playing in secret, the BJP plays it openly
 tippaniyan Nonetheless, return to the original point - what is the difference between Bharat and Bharat Mata
 bharat kaa zikr ek jatil canvas banaata he, jisamen itihaas bhi chalaa aata he, bhugol bhi, log bhi aa jate hai or unke sankat bhi
 We live in this India - the good and the bad of this India are responsible for everyone
 ham kabhi is bharat kii naak oonchi karte hai, kabhi ise apamaanit karte hai
 There are regional quarrels and discontent within this India - from Kashmir to the Northeast, there are regions which have a big complaint with this India
 is shikaayat kii kuch jaays or kuch najayas vajahen bhi ho sakati hai
 This India has a huge army, a sovereign government, a supreme parliament and all the systems that make it strong
 zaahir he, yah ek puraa jeeta-jaagta dhadkta hua desh he - apane sankaton se ghira, apni sambhaavnaaon se bharaa-puraa
 This Bharat is a reality - Bharat Mata is a fantasy
 magar yah kisi kalpana he? behichak kah sakate hai ki yah ek adarsh bharat kii kalpana he - vaise desh kii, jisamen koi rog-shok, dukh-matam, jhagade-vivaad na hon
 For such Bharat Mata, Jai will come out of everyone's mouth, there will be no need to forcibly remove anyone
 lekin yah zaruri he ki is bharat ko ham bharat maa ke aadarshon ke anuroop dhaalein
 This will be possible only when we rise above religious xenophobia, trying to digest the discontents that are arising within India
 sankat yah he ki bharat mata kaa naam lene vaala ek bahut bada tabaka jaise har kisi kii pariksha lene par tula rahata he
 He transforms Bharat Mata into one such slogan, a stick that can beat those who express dissatisfaction against different elements of the Indian nation state
 darasal bharat ko bharat mata kaa sthanapann bananaa betaa banakar us puri zamin par kabza karne kii koshish karnaa he, jis par darasal bahut saare logon kaa haq he
 If some people feel that the real India is being tried under the garb of this Mother India, they have the right to protest
 lekin jab kisi chune hue janpratinidhi ko ek rajya kii vidhansabha sirf isliye nilambit kar detii he ki vah bharat mata kii jai bolne ko taiyaar nahin he or isaki jagah jai hind bol rahaa he to samajha ja saktaa he ki rashtrawaad kaa yah bhoot kitna bada or khataranaak ho chalaa he
 When a slogan will be made the only criterion of patriotism, many people will start distributing and acquiring certificates of patriotism very easily
 phir yah deshbhakti unke bahut saare gunahon par pardaa daalane kaa kaam karegi
 It seems to be happening right now
 isse bharat kamazor ho rahaa he or bharat mata sharmasaar
 Of course, in our imagination of India, there should be a Mother India
 desh sirf kagaz kaa naqsha nahin hota
 We have a passionate relationship with him
 kyonki agar bharat mata nahin hogi, to bharat ek shushk bhugol kaa naam hoga, hamaari nason main bajane vaale sangeet kaa nahin, hamaare honton par tirane vaali kavita kaa nahin, hamaari ragon main daudane vaale khun kaa nahin
 But it is important to understand that by taking the name of Mother India again and again, we neither increase the honor of Mother India nor the power of India
 yah thik vaisaa hi he, jaise ham vaqt kii pabandi yaa sachai yaa ahimsa ko lekar rose mahatma gandhi ke sujhaaye raste kii andekhi karte hai, or rose unhen baapu yaa raashtrapati bataate hai
 This does not increase the honor of Mahatma Gandhi, it is less
 bharat yaa bharat mata kii izzat kaa maamla bhi yahi he
 When we are a tolerant democracy, the country feels big
 jab ham ek kattar samaaj dikhte hai, to desh chota ho jaataa he
 Bharat Mata is ashamed when we shed riots, Bharat Mata's honor rises when we save lives in floods and tsunamis
 lekin yah moti or adarshavaadi samaj to hamamen se har kisi ke paas honi chahie
 Why wouldn't she be? Because whatever we name India and Mother India, we do not understand it properly
 ham sabake apane-apane bharat hai
 Many people have wondered why India was not declared a Hindu nation after the partition of 1947
 unhen lagata he ki vibhaajan kaa makasad do aise raashtra bananaa tha, jinamein se ek main hindu or duusare main musalmaan rahen, jabaki apni sari vidmbanaaon or vibhaajan kii pidaa ke bich bhartiya raashtra rajya kii manyata thi ki pakistan bhale dharm ke aadhaar par apana raashtra banaae, lekin bharat un tamaam logon kaa mulk bana rahegaa, jo dharm or jati ke kisi bhedbhaav ke bina ek saath rahane ke hami hai
 It was a test that was very difficult in the years following Partition - as the rivers of blood were flowing on both sides of the border - but Hindustan won this test - he proved his greatness
 lekin hindustan ke, bharat ke yaa bharat mata ke bahut saare imtihaan jaise ab bhi baaki hai
 The Constitution gave everyone political equality and a dream of social equality, but this equality remains a dream till now
 bahut saare duusare logon ko malaal he ki loktantr kii vajah se sabakaa vot baraabar hua or 'raja' or 'parja' ek ho gaye
 The Indian nation state is basically a system of forward forces
 saamaajik jivan main jati kii paith bani hui he or shaadi-byaah ab bhi mote taur par jatigat daayre main hote hai
 The social inequality, which has become more insignificant at the economic level
 bahut bada hindustan apane hukmaranon se niraash he
 Governments are changing, but it appears that there is no fundamental difference between Modi and Manmohan, Chidambaram and Jaitley at the level of economics
 saamaajik soch main jo fark he, vah bhi bas itnaa hi he ki congress jis sampradayik card ko chhipaakar khelti rahi, use bijepi khullamakhulla khelti he
 The comments baharhaal, mul bindu par lauten - bharat or bharat mata main kya antar he
 The mention of India creates a complex canvas, in which history also comes, geography and people also come and their crises
 ham is bharat main rahete hai - is bharat ke achche-bure sabake zimmedaar hai
 We sometimes raise the nose of this India, sometimes humiliate it
 is bharat ke bheetar kshetreey jhagade or asantosh hai - kashmir se lekar purvottar tak aise pradesh hai, jinhen is bharat se badi shikaayat he
 There may be legitimate and some illegitimate reasons for this complaint
 is bharat ke paas ek vishaal sena he, ek samprabhu sarkaar he, ek sarvocch sansad he or ve sari vyavasthaaen hai, jo ise majboot banaati hai
 It is, of course, a full-blown throbbing country - surrounded by its own crises, full of possibilities
 yah bharat ek yatharth he - bharat mata ek kalpana he
 But what is this fantasy? Unsurprisingly one can say that this is the fantasy of a perfect India - a country in which there are no diseases, mourning, sorrows, mourning and disputes
 aisi bharat mata ke liye har kisi ke munh se jai niklegi, kisi se jabaran nikalwane kii zarurat nahin padegi
 But it is important that we adapt this India to the ideals of Mother India
 yah tabhi sambhav hoga, jab ham dharmik vidwaeshon se upar uthenge, un asantoshon ko pachaane kii koshish karenge, jo bharat ke bheetar paidaa ho rahe hai
 The problem is that a large section of the name of Mother India is bent on taking the test of everyone
 vah bharat mata ko ek aise naare, ek aisi chadi main badalata he, jisase un logon kii pitayee ho sake, jo bhartiya raashtra rajya ke alag-alag tatwon ke kilaaf asantosh jataate hai
 Actually, to make India the replacement of Mother India is to become a son and try to take possession of the entire land, which is actually the right of many people
 agar kuch log yah mahasoos karte hai ki is bharat mata kii aad main asli bharat par kabza karne kii koshish kii ja rahi he, to unako virodh karne kaa haq he
 But when a elected public representative suspends the assembly of a state simply because it is not ready to speak Bharat Mata ki Jai and instead says Jai Hind, then it can be understood how big and dangerous this ghost of nationalism is Has gone jab ek naare ko deshprem kii iklauti kasuti bana diya jayega to bahut saare log badi aasaani se deshbhakti kaa praaanpatr baantne or hasil karne lagenge
 Then this patriotism will work to cover many of their crimes
 philhal yahi hota lag rahaa he
 This is weakening India and shaming Mother India
 lekin yah samajhnaa zaruri he ki bharat mata kaa baar-baar naam lekar ham na bharat mata kaa sammaan badhaate hai na bharat kii shakti
 This is the same as how we ignore Mahatma Gandhi's suggested way of punctuality or truth or non-violence, and daily call him Bapu or President
 isse mahatma gandhi kii izzat badhati nahin, kuch kam hi hoti he
 This is also the case of Bharat or Mother India
 jab ham ek sahishnu loktantr hote hai, to desh bada lagata he
 When we appear to be a staunch society, the country becomes smaller
 jab ham dangon main koon bahaate hai, to bharat mata sharminda hoti he, jab ham baadh or tsunami main logon kii jaan bachaate hai, to bharat mata kii izzat badhati he
 But this thick and idealistic understanding must be held by all of us
 vah hoti kyon nahin? kyonki ham bharat or bharat mata kaa naam jitna bhi len, ise thik se samajhate nahin
 We all have our own India
 bahut saare logon ko malaal he ki 1947 ke vibhaajan ke baad bharat ko hindu raashtra kyon nahin ghoshit kiya gaya
 They felt that the purpose of partition was to create two nations, one of which would be Hindu and the other one to be Muslim, while in the midst of all the irony and agony of partition, the Indian state of the nation believed that Pakistan should make its nation based on good religion
 , But India will remain the country of all those who agree to live together without any discrimination of religion and caste
 yah vah imtihaan tha, jo vibhaajan ke baad ke varshon main bahut kadaa tha - kyonki sarhad ke donon taraf koon kii nadiyaan bah rahi thim - lekin hindustan yah imtihaan jitkar niklaa - usne apana badppan sabit kiya
 But there are still many examinations of India, India or Mother India
 samvidhan ne sabko raajnneetik barabari di or saamaajik barabari kaa sapana diya, lekin yah barabari ab tak sapana bani hui he
 Many other people are sorry that due to democracy, everyone got equal vote and 'raja' and 'parja' became one
 bhartiya raashtra rajya multah agadon kaa tantra he
 Caste remains in the social life and marriages are still largely within the caste hierarchy
 jo saamaajik gairbarabari he, vah aarthik str par or zyaada alanghy hoti gai he
 Very large India is disappointed with its ruling
 sarkarein badal rahi hai, lekin yah nazar aata he ki modi or manmohan main, chidambaram or jetali main arthniti ke str par koi buniyadi fark nahin he
 The difference in social thinking is also that the communal card that the Congress kept playing in secret, the BJP plays it openly
 tippaniyan Nonetheless, return to the original point - what is the difference between Bharat and Bharat Mata
 bharat kaa zikr ek jatil canvas banaata he, jisamen itihaas bhi chalaa aata he, bhugol bhi, log bhi aa jate hai or unke sankat bhi
 We live in this India - the good and the bad of this India are responsible for everyone
 ham kabhi is bharat kii naak oonchi karte hai, kabhi ise apamaanit karte hai
 There are regional quarrels and discontent within this India - from Kashmir to the Northeast, there are regions which have a big complaint with this India
 is shikaayat kii kuch jaays or kuch najayas vajahen bhi ho sakati hai
 This India has a huge army, a sovereign government, a supreme parliament and all the systems that make it strong
 zaahir he, yah ek puraa jeeta-jaagta dhadkta hua desh he - apane sankaton se ghira, apni sambhaavnaaon se bharaa-puraa
 This Bharat is a reality - Bharat Mata is a fantasy
 magar yah kisi kalpana he? behichak kah sakate hai ki yah ek adarsh bharat kii kalpana he - vaise desh kii, jisamen koi rog-shok, dukh-matam, jhagade-vivaad na hon
 For such Bharat Mata, Jai will come out of everyone's mouth, there will be no need to forcibly remove anyone
 lekin yah zaruri he ki is bharat ko ham bharat maa ke aadarshon ke anuroop dhaalein
 This will be possible only when we rise above religious xenophobia, trying to digest the discontents that are arising within India
 sankat yah he ki bharat mata kaa naam lene vaala ek bahut bada tabaka jaise har kisi kii pariksha lene par tula rahata he
 He transforms Bharat Mata into one such slogan, a stick that can beat those who express dissatisfaction against different elements of the Indian nation state

 lekin jab kisi chune hue janpratinidhi ko ek rajya kii vidhansabha sirf isliye nilambit kar detii he ki vah bharat mata kii jai bolne ko taiyaar nahin he or isaki jagah jai hind bol rahaa he to samajha ja saktaa he ki rashtrawaad kaa yah bhoot kitna bada or khataranaak ho chalaa he

 abhi tak savita bhabhi ke graphic comic ke bare main mujhe jo sabase apratyaashit tarif mili he, vah ek mahila kii taraf se he jisane mujhe savita ko dikhaane ke liye dhanyavad diya jo har episod main charam-sukh (orgasm) praapt karti he
 The reason for expressing her gratitude is very clear and i am willing to bet that after studying Savita Bhabhi, many husbands would have asked their wives about achieving women's orgasm and also How can they help them to reach them? india today-emdiare 2013 sex survey ke nattejey bataate hai ki kareeb 80 fisadi mahilaayein ‘‘hameshaa’’ yaa ‘‘zyaadaatar’’ charam-sukh hasil karti hai
 In view of this result, i would like to believe that Savita Bhabhi also has a small role in bridging the gap between sex needs of men and women
 nijee taur par main yah nahin maanata ki 2003 ke baad bhartiya mahila main itnaa zyada badlaav aayaa he
 However, now it has become more acceptable for a woman to talk openly about her sex needs and aspirations
 i do not know any difference between the evening tea parties of Indian women's groups, but i believe that sex and There must have been discussion about his victory and now it was not just the jurisdiction of young men
 main hameshaa yah sochataa tha ki savita bhabhi mahilaon main zyada lokapriy hogi, sirf isliye kyonki yah mahilaon kii sexuelity ko samanyikaran se kahin aage le jaati he or aisi shaktishaalee mahila pesh karti he jo aatmavishvaas se labarej he or apni sexuelity kaa bharpoor lutf uthaanaa chaahati he
 When we conducted a survey a year ago, it was not surprising to learn that 30 percent of our readers are women
 haalanki, main yah sweekaar karnaa chaahunga ki jab hamane Savitabhabhi
 com was not "feminine liberation" on our top agenda - it was gradually transformed into a graphic novel in which sex is in the hands of women! When we started getting female readers' feedback, So it was realized that this could be an ideal platform to educate Indian men about the fact that women also have sexual needs
 mere hisaab se kaaphi had tak yah badlaav is vajah se bhi ho rahaa tha ki internet ke madhyam se bharat duniya kii samskruti ke liye apane daravaaje khol rahaa tha
 Now not only are women getting more information about sex and various types of use, but their male partners also have better understanding and acceptance of the sexual desires of women
 tamaam aalochak kehete hai ki savita bhabhi mahilaon ko upbhog kii vastu kii tarah dikhaati he
 But i believe that the truth is quite the opposite
 savita bhabhi ke madhyam se ham yah dikhaane kii koshish kar rahe hai ki sex koi aisi cheez nahin he jise sirf mard hi chahta he
 Actually, this is a two-way affair - a woman wants as much fun as a man
 agar ham apane 50 fisadi pathakon tak bhi yah baat pahunchaa paaen to aap bharat main mahilaon ko zyada khush dekh paaenge
 Unlike every critic who shouts like a wolf, we find 10 such people, especially women, who praise Savita Bhabhi for presenting the message of women's sexual freedom
 meri raay main is yon aazaadee kii mukhya vajah bhartiya mardon or auraton main satta santulan kaa nae sire se nirmaan hona he
 The women of 2013 are more powerful and independent than before, who go ahead and show their sexuality more openly
 internet or soochnaaon ke anya sroton tak pahunch se ham yah ummid kar sakate hai ki yah rujhaan aage bhi jari rahegaa or bhartiya mahilaayein sex sahit jivan ke sabhi pahaluon main zyada aazaadee hasil karengi
 Now she is deciding her role in the bedroom herself, or doing whatever other experiments she wants to do for sexual intercourse
 deshmukh di

 uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri kii kursi sambhalate hi yogi adityanath ne jo shuruaati ghoshnaaen kin, unamem se ek badi ghoshnaa hinduon kii kailash maansarovar yatra par di jane vaali sarkari sabsidi ko 50,000 ru
 Increased from Rs one lakh to Rs
 karnaa rahi
 Not only did the Hindu community welcome the doubling of the subsidy in one stroke, many people compared it to the government subsidy given to the Muslim community on Haj pilgrimage
 lekin dilachasp baat yah rahi ki kailash maansarovar yatra par sabsidi badaye jane ke baad muslim samudaay ne haj sabsidi badhaane kii bajaae ise khatm karne kii maang tej kar di he
 The Muslim community believes that in the name of subsidy, they are not only fraudulent, but by doing so, there is a disturbing message among the people of other communities that the government is appeasing the Muslims
 kendriya haj samiti ke purv adhyaksh salaamat ullah do-took lahaze main kehete hai, ''yah sabsidi kuch nahin he, bas yah samaj lijie ki paisa vitt mantralay ke khate se nikalakar videsh mantralay or vahaan se air india ke khate main pahunch jaataa he
 Haji does not have a pie in his hand
 " unka kahana he ki haj cameti ke madhyam se yatra karne vaale hajiyon ke liye yah anivaary he ki ve yaa to air india se safar karen yaa phir saudi arab kii sarkari airline saudiya se safar karen
 "during the Haj, these airlines double the fare for the Hajis, while normal fares are charged from other passengers during this time," he said
 yani sarkaar sabsidi haj yatriyon ko nahin, balki air india ko de rahi he
 “going to the math of Haj subsidy, in 2008 it was Rs 827 crore
 tak pahunch gai thi
 After that the government decided to reduce it
 baad main 2012 main supreme court ne kaha ki agle 10 saal main sabsidi puri tarah khatm kar di jaae
 Supporting this point, Islamic affairs expert Zafarul Islam says, "what is the need to wait till 2022, this subsidy should be discontinued immediately
" " unka maananaa he ki sabsidi khatm kar central haj cameti haj yatra ke liye antarrashtriya tender nikaale or jo companiyaan sabase kam kiraye par hajiyon ko le jane ko taiyaar hon, unhen yah kaam saunpa jaae
 1 this year from India
 70 lakh log haj yatra par jaaenge
 Of these, about 1
25 lakh will go through the Haj Committee and the rest through private operators
 haj yatra ke liye package uplabdh karaane vaali dilli kii ek travel agency ke sanchaalak em
 Says Tariq, "when an airline gets the opportunity to take such a large group on a trip together, it will obviously reduce the fare
" vaise bhi haj par sabsidi dena islam ke hisaab se thik nahin he
 Haj pilgrimage is not right for any Muslim by taking loans or donations
 sabsidi se kiya haj to kisi kaam kaa nahin he
 "pointing to the second use of the Haj subsidy, Salamat Ullah says," The central government does not provide any money for the salaries of about 500 employees of the Haj Committee
 yah paisa bhi to hajiyon se mili paise se hi nikalataa he
 It is better that the government stop the subsidy so that people know whether the subsidy was actually available or not
 " muslim sangathlon kii haj sabsidi par is aakraamak raay ke baad yogi adityanath ko is baat kaa bhi pataa lagane kii koshish kerani chahie ki kailash maansarovar yatra par unhone jo sabsidi badhaai he, vah vaaki tirthayatriyon ko milegi yaa haj sabsidi kii tarah sarkari khajaane main gum kar rah jaaegi

 ajit pavaar kii ensipi main vapasisupriya sule ne gale lagaakar kiya svaagatsharad pavaar se kal raat kii thi mulaqatmaharashtra kii raajnneeti main pichley ek hafte main kaaphi kuch badal gaya he
 Ajit Pawar, who was the Deputy Chief Minister for nearly 80 hours, has returned home
 mangalvaar ko istipha dene ke baad vah sidhe apane chachaa sharad pavaar se milane pahunche or sabhi gile-shikave ko dur kiya
 But it seems that Ajit Pawar, who rebelled from the party for power, has been forgiven by the party because there are indications that he may get a bigger responsibility again
 sharad pavaar ne kar diya maaf
 
 
 When the assembly session started on Wednesday morning, Ajit Pawar also arrived to take the oath of office
 isi ke baad party netaa nawab malik ne bayaan diya ki ajit pavaar party kaa hissaa hai, unhone jo kiya uske liye maafee maang lee he
 Nawab Malik said that Sharad Pawar has forgiven Ajit, his responsibility in the party will remain the same
 mil sakati he badi jimmedaari?shivasena netaa sanjay raut ne bhi ajit pavaar kii vaapasi par bayaan diya or kaha ki vah ek bada kaam karke laute hai
 Sanjay Raut said that he will find the right place
 vahiin supriya sule ne bhi vidhansabha pahunchane par ajit pavaar kaa gale lagaakar swaagat kiya or kaha ki parivaar main khatta-meetha laga rahata he, ye unka hi ghar he
 who said what
 
 
 ensipi netaa dhananjay munde ne ajit pavaar kii vaapasi par kaha ki vah is vakt sabase khush vyakti hai, vah kabhi bhi bijepi ke saath nahin gaye
 At the same time, Samajwadi Party leader Abu Azmi also said that Ajit Pawar has done a great job, he is our salute
 itnaa hi nahin jab ajit pavaar shapath lene ke liye vidhansabha main pahunche to NCP vidhayakon ne ‘hamaara netaa kaisaa ho, ajit dada pavaar jaisaa ho’
 Thackeray Raj: 7 xxrep 4 0 chairs, kejriwal-mamta guest took
 sharad pavaar ne unki jagah jayant patil ko ensipi vidhayak dal kaa netaa bana diya tha or vip jari karne kaa adhikaar bhi unhen hi diya tha
 In such a situation, now that Ajit Pawar is back in the party and everything seems to be fine, will he be given the same post again, everyone's eye is also on this
