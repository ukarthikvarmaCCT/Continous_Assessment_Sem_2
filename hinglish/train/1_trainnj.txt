 ) rashtriya janata dal ke adhyaksh lalu prasad ne buudhvaar ko pradhanmantri narendra modi par jamkar hamalaa bolaa
 Lalu Yadav has accused PM Modi of being a vampire and said that PM Modi had promised to provide a package for Bihar but that turned out to be a 'fake'
 artiai se hue khulaase par lalu yadav ne kaha ki modi ne oktober 2015 ke vidhansabha chunaavon ke dauraan bihar ko 1
 a package of Rs 25 lakh crore was promised, which is still awaited
 bihar main sattadhari mahagathbandhan main shaamil argedy, jediu or congress ne artiai se mili jaankaree ke baad bijepi kii aguwai vaali centre sarkaar or rajya main vipakshi dal bijepi par nishaanaa saadhaa
 Leaders of the Mahagathbandhan say that it is a big question that Modi and BJP are making 'dhumadhar' promises during the assembly elections in the neighboring state of Uttar Pradesh too, but their completion is a question mark
 mumbai ke artiai kaaryakarta anil galgali ne disambar 2016 main kendriya vitt mantralay se modi sarkaar kii ore se vibhinn rajyon ko die gaye vittiya sahaayta yaa deveopment package ke aashwaasan ke bare main jaankaree maangi thi
 In which it was also asked how many of the assurances given were fulfilled
 haalanki, vitt mantralay ke up nideshak anand parmaar ne is artiai kaa sidhaa uttar dene kii bajaae golmol jawaab dekar sthiti spasht karne kii koshish kii he
 RTI activist Galgali revealed from RTI that on August 18, 2015, the Prime Minister announced a special package of Rs 1,25,003 crore for Bihar
 lekin vitt mantralay ke adhikari parmaar ke sankshipt uttar main kaha gaya he ki 'pariyojnaon yaa kaaryon ko silsilewar tareeke se puraa kiya jayega
 However, till date no money has been released by the Finance Ministry
 vitt mantralay se mili jawaab ke aadhaar pargalgali ne kaha ki yah sharmnaak heki bihar ko yah aashwaasan kisi or ne nahin balki desh ke pradhanmantri ne diya tha, lekin dedh saal guzarane ke baad bhi is par koi karrwai nahin kii gai he
 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has not said anything on the matter so far, but Lalu Yadav in his unique style advised Modi that a person sitting in a top constitutional post like the Prime Minister should not 'lie like this
 ' lalu yadav ne ek twit saajha kar piem modi par nishaanaa saadhaa he
 Lalu Yadav said that Modi had promised to make Varanasi Kyoto in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, but after almost three years his tussle has opened up and it has been proved that his words and promises are only a 'bundle of lies'
 jediu ke varisht netaa or party pravaktaa niraj kumaar ne kaha ki yah hamaari baat ko sabit karata he ki modi kii ore se ghoshit vishesh package keval 'jumala' he or kuch nahin he
 Bihar Education Minister and Congress President of the state Ashok Chaudhary says that the Prime Minister should take care of the promises made to the people
 unhone kaha ki congress party ne us samay bihar ke liye modi ke vishesh package kii ghoshnaa par andeh kiya tha, lekin piem modi ko sirf vaada karne kii aadat he, naa ki unhen puraa karne kii
 BJP leaders of Bihar do not want to talk on this issue
 unamem se kuch kaa kahana he ki is mudde par sirf rashtriya netaa hi pratikriya de sakate hai

 It is the biggest complication of the old politics that his past eats away
 logon ke paas paaramparik raajnneeti ke khattey tajurbon kaa itnaa data he ki vah ummiido kii jadon ko jamane nahin detaa
 On the other hand, the trouble of the new politics is that it does not have a past that can make its future reliable
 upar se uske tatke or angadh taur-tareeke sashankit kar dete hai
 It is not difficult to understand the huge confusion of the capital of the country, traveling in the Delhi Metro, listening to the Batakhi on the streets and tuning the election surveys
 viraat isliye kyonki dilli desh kii vividhta kaa sabase bada sample he
 Delhi's atmosphere is far deeper than electric-water debates
 ek nai gavarnence kii ummiden nau maheene baad, tut kar chubhane lagi hai to duusari taraf 49 din kii ek badahavaas sarkaar kaa tajurba ummiido kii badhat ko barajtaa he
 Skepticism is, in fact, between giving up old politics versus giving new politics a chance, which has been embedded within the election debates
 dilli ke log is asamanjas ko vaicharik agrahon, kisson, mohbhangon, ummiido va tajurbon main sinjhaate hue, ek aadhe-adhure rajya ke chunaav ko bhartiya siyasat kaa sabase romaanchak muqabla banane ja rahe hai
 The results of the election will not be as surprising as Arvind Kejriwal's return to Delhi politics
 49 din kii bikhri, baukhalaai or naatakeey sarkaar ke baad aam aadmi party ko itihaas ban janaa chahie tha
 Short-lived governments are not new, but this low-income government was disgraceful, which could neither give direction to politics nor to governance
 loktantr main andolanon kii apni ek garima he or gavarnence kii apni ek samhita
 Kejriwal could not manage both during the 49-day experiment
 unki asafal sarkaar ko gujarey lanbaa samay bhi nahin beetaa he lekin kejariwal kaa majboot mukaable main lautnaa anokhaa he
 According to election surveys, if Kejriwal is educated and the first choice of modern Delhi, then one must accept that there is something else that is washing away the failure of his 49-day government
 lagata he ki loksabhaa main bhavy va ekatarfa janadesh ke baavjood, puraani raajnneeti ke vikalp kii ummid ab bhi kasmasaa rahi he or yahi ummid dilli main ek baar phir jujh janaa chaahati he
 The small government experience of the new politics of the Aam Aadmi Party was an astringent, but the functioning of the nine-month-old central government has helped Kejriwal to hide this vulnerability
 2014 kaa loksabhaa chunaav siyasat ke paaramparik sultaanon kii hi jang tha, alabatta matadaata nae the, isliye chunavi badlaav, darasal gavarnence main badlaav kii ummiido ke taur par pesh ho gaya
 Narendra Modi also derives from the same traditional model of politics in which the Congress was established
 2014 kaa janadesh gavarnence ke us congressi dhaanche ke khilaaf tha jo umradraj ho gaya tha or koi nattejey nahin de paa rahaa tha
 But the heavy government, the defections and the BJP saving power in select hands, is as much as the Congress today
 nai sarkaar ke pehle nau maah main gavarnence ratti bhar nahin badali
 Only then are there no changes visible on the ground nor far reaching
 jaahir he ki dilli ke log centre kii sarkaar ke sabase nikat padosi hai isliye mohabhang kaa taapmaana yahaan zyada he jo na keval 49 din ke 'kejariwali prayog' kii naakaami ko bhulane main madad kar rahaa he balki nai raajnneeti ko aajamaane kii aakankshaon ko takat de rahaa he
 Expectations from the new government have not only diminished, the Aam Aadmi Party has also changed a lot after 49 days of government
 kejariwal tajurbon se sikhkar bijepi or congress ke taur-tareekon main dhal rahe hai
 The arrogance, domination, contradiction, defection which was the hallmark of the old politics, now also belong to the Aam Aadmi Party which fits it in the traditional field of politics
 ve ab sting opareshnon, ambaniyon ko suuli par taangane or palak jhapakate kranti karne kii baat nahin karte balki puraane loklubhaavan tareekon ko nai raajnneeti main chaturaai se lapetane lage hai
 Yet his new strength in politics is his biggest strength
 jaraa sochie ki baari jansamarthan par baithe narendra modi nai raajnneeti ke model kaa kuch hissaa aajamaate yaa parrdishta ke agrahon ko majbootee se lagu kar paae hote to
 
 
 The elections of a state are small changes in the history of a large country, but when there is a direct contest between new and old politics, the matter changes
 golieth ne apni sari ladaaiyaan vishaal sharir, baari kavach or lambey bhaale kii badaulat jiti thim
 He had the experience of winning the battle more than the catapult David
 isliye uskaa aatmavishvaas galat nahin tha
 David changed the rules and the dice were reversed
 nai raajnneeti ke aagrah dilli kaa khel badal rahe hai or bijepi kii paaramparik siyasat ve baichaiyn dikhaai de rahi he
 Of course, the result of Delhi elections will not have any effect on the central government but the result will definitely leave a big impact on democracy
 is chunaav main dilli ke log keval nai sarkaar hi nahin chunenge balki yah bhi tay karenge ki dilli puri tarah paaramparik raajnneeti ke saath he yaa phir nai raajnneeti ke kisi chote-se start ap main bhi, apane vishwaas kaa nivesh karnaa chaahate hai
 The confusion of Delhi is crucial
 dilli kii bekhudi besabab nahin he, kuch to he jisaki pardadari he

 daure ke liye ghoshit kii gai team main rishabh pant, kuldeep yadav jaise khilaadi the
 Apart from these two, Mohammed Shami and Dinesh Karthik, who were just 'spectators' in the Champion's Trophy, are also seen as an opportunity to prove usefulness
 tour main 'bench strength' ko parakhane ke lihaaj se vajah bhi thim
 The starless Indies ODI team was much weaker than the current team India and before the World Cup-2019, this series was considered to be a great 'platform' to test young players
 baharhaal, is siries main kuldeep yadav, shami or karthik ko to khilne kaa mauka mil gaya, lekin yuva wicketiper ballebaaj rishabh pant apni baari kaa intjaar hi karte rah gaye
 The Indian team now has to play a T20 match on Sunday in the West Indies tour
 pratibhavan rishabh pant ke 'vanade debyue' ko lekar cricketpremiyon main khaasi utsukata thi
 Pant, a left-handed aggressive batsman, has been a great performer in recent times
 ranji trophy or phir ipel main apane pradarshan se unhone har kisi kii prashansa hasil kii he
 There is also talk of preparing him as an alternative to future wicketkeeper batsman Mahendra Singh Dhoni
 pant ko lekar yah ummid tab paravaan chadhati najar ai jab duusare vanade match ke baad viraat kohli ne is yuva ko aage ke maichon main plaing ilevan main hissaa dene ke sanket die
 But the match went on and on Pant, it was hopeful
 vaise is siries main 'chinamen' kuldeep yadav ko sabhi paanch match khilne kaa mauka mila
 In which he 19
 75 ke ausat se aath wicket hasil kiye
 With his bowling, he troubled the West Indies batsmen

 Rishabh made his T20 career debut against England in Bengaluru on 1 February 2017
 worldcup 2019 main abhi kareeb do varsh baaki hai
 In such a situation, the Indian team management will have to give more and more 'international exposure' to young players like Rishabh Pant and Kuldeep Yadav

 Hrithik Roshan's superhit film Koi Mil Gaya has completed 15 years

 Its character named Jadoo was very famous, but do you know about the person who was hidden behind this character

 He has acted in many films

 The magic costume was created by Australian artist James Kellner
 Koi mil gaya gave birth to Krrish, and in a weird way playing Rohit gave birth to a newfound strength in myself
 Rohit helped me understand every single thing i went thru as a boy with a stutter
 And made me realize how everything that ‚Äúis‚Äù was simply meant to be
 He helped me understand that strength was not as important as courage
 And that it was ok to have weaknesses
 And that being ok with your weaknesses in itself was courage
 Another beautiful thing he taught me is never to assume what other people are thinking
 He never did
 Never tried to mind read others like we do so often in this age of sms and whatsapp
 Rohit took things at face value or based on evidence
 a good tip for today‚Äôs gen who should know that u can never really communicate the tone while typing the words
 Today relationships are sometimes at the mercy of how the typed sentence is interpreted
 15 years ago jaadu happened in the theaters and another jaadu in my own life
 So keep going
 Others have said this before , I‚Äôm saying it now and you will say it one day looking back at the things that didn‚Äôt make sense
 It's all going to work out
 i promise 
 On its 15th anniversary, I'm sharing a few of my favorite moments from the film
 i want to thank all the people who were part of this amazing journey
 Receiving my dad n mom
 And ofcourse thank you to all of you for the love u gave me

 We want to re-examine the case and disclose the plot of the Naxalite attack
 jab se ham shashan main aae hai tab se koshish kar rahe hai ki vaade ke mutabik ham swatantra jaanch kar saken
 But the central government is constantly ignoring our demand
 gauratlab he ki chhattisgarh chunaav ke samay congress ne vaada kiya tha ki agar unki sarkaar bani to 2013 jheram naksali hamale kii swatantra jaanch kii jaaegi
 a SIT has been formed under the leadership of Bastar IG as soon as the Congress government is formed

 It is also called Vivah Panchami

 puranic dharmik grathon ke anusaar is tithi kobhagwan ram ne janak nandini sitaase vivaah kiya tha jiskaa varnan shriramcharitamanas main mahakavi goswami tulsidasji ne rochak tareeke se kiya he
 According to Shri Ramcharitmanas, Maharaja Janak composed a swayamvar for the marriage of Sita
 sita ke swayamvar main aae sabhi raja-maharaja jab bhagwaan shiv kaa dhanush nahin uthaa saken, tab rishi vishwamitra ne prabhu shriram se ajna dete hue kaha- he ram! utho, shivaji kaa dhanush todo or janak kaa santaap mitaao
 Hearing the words of Guru Vishwamitra, Shri Ram immediately got up and proceeded to offer the bow to the bow
 yah drishy dekhakar sita ke man main ullas chaa gaya
 Seeing towards the Lord, Sitaji decided in his mind that this body will belong to him or not
 mata sita ke man kii baat prabhu shriram jaan gaye or unhone dekhte hi dekhte bhagwaan shiv kaa mahaan dhanush uthaaya
 After this, the bow broke with a terrible sound as soon as it was offered to him
 yah dekhakar sita ke man ko santosh hua
 Then Sita came near Shri Ram
 sakhiyon ke bich main janaki ain, tab ek sakhi ne sita se jayamala pehanaane ko kaha
 At that time, their hands were getting decorated in such a way, as if two lotuses with sticks were giving Jayamala fearing the moon
 tab sitaaji ne shriram ke gale main jayamala pahana di
 Gods started showering flowers after seeing this scene
 nagar or akaash main baaje bajane lage
 The shriram-sita couple was embellishing in this way, as if beauty and makeup juices had gathered
 prithvi, pataal or swarg main yash fail gaya ki shriram ne dhanush tod diya or sitaaji kaa varan kar liya
 In view of this, Shukla Panchami of Aghaan month is celebrated every year in special Rama temples
 maryaada purushottam shriram-sita ke shubh vivaah ke kaaran hi yah din atyant pavitra mana jaataa he
 rama-sita is considered an ideal couple in Indian culture

 Dr
 Dinesh Jain, an expert on diseases related to reproduction and childlessness, said, ‚Äúthe trend of surrogacy in the state has been increasing since last few years
 log pehle ke mukaable aarthik or maansik taur par aaj zyada majboot hai
 They are rejecting the rigid beliefs of the society in a strong desire for children
 ‚Äôdow jain kehete hai, ‚Äòeuropea deshon ke mukaable bharat main sarogesi kaa kharch paanch se chah guna kam he
 Secondly, it is very difficult to find surrogacy in these countries, because it is difficult for most of the women there to follow the strict terms of the surrogacy contract due to their modern lifestyle
 ‚Äôunhone bataaya ki pradesh main aisi mahilaon kii taadaad pehle ke mukaable badi he, jinhen apni aarthik jaruratein puri karne ke liye saroget maa banane se parhez nahin he
 Informed sources said that Indore is a major stronghold in the state of surrogacy

 Piyush Jain, a lawyer associated with surrogacy cases, believes, 'completely strong legislation is very important for these cases, so that some complexities can be resolved better
 ‚Äô unhone kaha ki sarogesi suvidha muhaiyaa karaane vaale clinicon par swasthya vibhaag ko baraabar nigaah rakhni chaiye, taaki pataa chal sake ki ve is sandarbh main bhartiya ayurvigyaan anusandhan parishad (isiemr) ke disha-nirdeshon kaa paalan kar rahe hai yaa nahin

 Aam Aadmi Party MLA and former Law Minister Somnath Bharti, who was in the Delhi government, has received a setback from the court
 africa mul kii mahilaon se durvyavhaar ke maamle main lagaai gai dobaaraa jaanch kii arji ko patiala house court ne khaarij kar diya he
 The case dates back to 2014 when nine African women lodged a complaint during Somnath Bharti's time as law minister that he entered their homes illegally and treated them badly
 somnath bharti kii taraf se arji lagaai gai thi ki maamle kii jaanch dobaaraa kii jaae jise court ne aaj khaarij kar diya
 Along with Somnath, the police have accused 17 people
 somnath bharti ne dobaaraa jaanch ke liye duusari baar arji lagaai thi jise court ne khaarij kar diya
 The Delhi Police has already filed its charge sheet in the court in this case
 somnath bharti is cese main aaropee ke taur par philhal court main trial phase kar rahe hai
 After the Supreme Court's order, now in all the cases of Delhi in which the MLA and MP are accused, the court has to complete its hearing within a year and give its verdict
 1 march se supreme court ne vidhayakon or saansadon se jude sabhi maamalon main naa sirf special court gathit kii he balki unki sunwaayee ke liye 1 saal kii samay seemaa bhi tay kar di he
 This means that in this case related to Somnath Bharti, the court will give its verdict in 1 year, which will decide whether the allegations made by African women were true and whether Somnath Bharti will get any relief from the court

 is diwaali party main actor karan patel or karanvir bohara apni patniyon ke saath pahunche

 Members of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), whether they are senior leaders or grassroots activists or Prime Minister Narendra Modi, have not hesitated to attribute the party's dazzling performance in the Lok Sabha elections to its ideological parent organization RSS
 haalanki jan dharna main bhagava party kii chunavi kamyaabi kii kahani main yah sanghathan sabase nichle paaydaan par he
 Now that three months have passed and the political dust has fallen, the results of the opinion poll are showing that the role of the RSS and even top leaders like Rajnath Singh and Amit Shah in the bjp's victory is very modest
 Was living survey main hissaa lene vaale sirf do fisadi logon kaa maananaa he ki is jeet kaa shrey aresas ko diya janaa chahie
 This is less than three per cent credit given to both Rajnath and Shah
 log bijepi kaaryakartaaon kii vishaal fouj ko bhi is jeet main hissedari dene ko taiyaar nahin hai kyonki sirf paanch fisadi log hi kaaryakartaaon ko iskaa shrey de rahe hai
 On the other hand, 64 per cent of the people have credited the victory to Modi, who started campaigning for himself and his party a year before the election and who was later made the party's formal prime ministerial candidate
 modi ke rajnatik virodhiyon kii dharna ke ulat sirf 12 fisadi log maanate hai ki nae pradhanmantri kii lagaam aresas ke haathon main hogi
 Instead, 47 per cent believe that Modi himself will follow his own path
 iske alaava 31 fisadi log yah maanate hai ki sangh parivaar ke saath kisi bhi kism ke sangharsh ko modi achche se sanbhaalane main kaamyaab rahenge or vivaadaaspad masalon par ve sangh parivaar ke saath santulan bitha paane main bhi samarth honge
 More than 9% of the people believe that the reason for this was 'upa's failure', more than the number of people who gave credit for bjp's victory to RSS or BJP cadre
 yah tathy janadesh par bijepi ke varisht netaa laalkrishna adwani ke vishleshan kaa samarthan karata he, jinhone kaha tha ki congress netritv vaale upie kii naakaami se jo dharna paidaa hui, vahi bijepi kii kamyaabi ke liye jimmedaar he
 Another proof of public confidence in Modi is the fact that those who believe that Shah should not have been made the president of the party as criminal cases are pending against him are extremely few
 sirf 12 fisadi log maanate hai ki shah ko bijepi kaa adhyaksh nahin banaaya janaa chahie tha jabaki 20 fisadi log ise party par modi kii pakad ko majboot banane kii ranneeti ke taur par ek durust kadam maanate hai
 Apart from this, 32 percent of the people surveyed believe that Shah will take the BJP to new heights
 ek dilachasp tathy yah saamne aayaa ki survey main shaamil 48 fisadi logon kii raay main modi ne apane mantriyon ko 'apraasangik‚Äô bana daalaa he, lekin 37 fisadi aisa nahin maanate
 If people feel that Modi has made his ministers 'irrelevant', one of the reasons may be the restrictions imposed on him by the ministers in the appointment of private secretaries
 darasal modi cabinet ke mantriyon ko un logon ke nijee sachiv banane par roak lagaai gai thi jinhone upie ke mantriyon ke nijee staff ke taur par kaam kiya ho
 Not only did Rajnath Singh face embarrassment due to this rule but it also created problems for Arun Jaitley
 unhone yah kahkar is niyam se chhot lee ki rajyasabha main netaa vipaksh ke taur par unke kaarykaal ke dauraan rahe unke nijee staff ko is farmaan kaa shikaar na banaaya jaae
 The most striking example of Modi's control over the administration is that the Home Minister's opinion does not matter in specific appointments
 haalanki ve cabinet kii niyukti sambandhi cameti ke sadsy hai
 Now most of the appointments are being approved by the PMO and Rajnath has to just seal the formality once it is announced
 rajnatik vishleshkon ke mutabik, chunki logon main aam dharna yah he ki modi ke kaaran hi bijepi ko chunaav main itane vot mili hai, isliye unhen apane man mutabik sarkaar chalaane kii chhot milti ja rahi he or party sanghathan kaa koi bhi dabaav kaam nahin kar paa rahaa he
 This can be seen in Modi's selection of his ministers, the restrictions imposed on the personal staff of ministers, steps to change the governors and not bowing down to senior leaders with dynastic political heritage
 aise netaaon main party ke purv adhyaksh murali manohar joshi bhi shaamil hai jinhen philhal ek kinare bitha diya gaya he kyonki ve bujurg hai
 Similarly, Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha President Anurag Thakur has also been excluded from the government because he is the son of a former Chief Minister
 modi kii lokapriyata par muhar lagane vaale desh kaa mizaaj, surveykshan ke nateezon ke lihaaj se dekhen to aisa jaan padataa he ki sarkaar se baahar rakhe jane par sawaal na uthaakar in netaaon ne samajhadaari bharaa kaam hi kiya he
 Even the RSS has technically avoided putting a leg in this jurisdiction of Modi, who openly suggested the name of the finance minister of his choice in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government
 survey main shaamil 78 fisadi logon ne kaha he ki modi ne jo cabinet banaai he, vah acchhee he
 The Prime Minister is also very cautious in the matter of political appointments so that he is not accused of nepotism
 sutron kii maane to modi ne apni shuruaati cabinet baithkon main hi yah saaf kar diya tha ki mantri apane mantralayon main ekatarfa tareeke se rajnatik niyuktiyaan nahin karenge
 Instead, he asked the ministers to prepare a list of vacant political posts under them, on which the names of suitable candidates will be suggested by the party organization
 itane sab ke bich modi yah nahin bhuule hai ki janata se unke judaav kaa apana mahatv he
 While he has taken time to inaugurate projects in states where elections are to be held, he has also arranged that one of his ministers will be present in the party office every day to hear the grievances of the party workers
 is vyavastha ko banane kaa jimmaa amit shah kaa he, jinhone ek aisi pranali viksit kii he jisamen un mantriyon ke naam saarvajanik kiye jaaenge jo party daftar main rojaanaa shikaayat nibatare ke liye maujuud honge
 Modi's suggestions are not just suggestions, he is being taken by the party and his ministers like a decree
 philhal to bijepi kaa shoman hi ab tak kaa sho chalaa rahaa he
 Who should be credited for bjp's spectacular victory in the Lok Sabha elections? 64% Narendra Modi 9% upa's failure 5% BJP workers 3% Amit Shah 3% Rajnath Singh 2% RSS Who is the most honest leader among these? 36% Narendra Modi 5% Sonia Gandhi 4% What is your opinion on Rahul Gandhi 4% Arvid Kejriwal being made president of BJP? 32% They will take the party to new heights 20% It is the control of the party
 Shy's strategy is 12% BJP should not have appointed him
 Is Modi's style of work irrelevant to his ministers? 48% Yes 37% No 65% According to people, Modi is still the best candidate for bjp's Prime Minister, 78% believe That Modi has chosen a good cabinet 2008 ke maalegaanv blast maamle main NIA ne supreme court main jawaab daakhil kar diya he
 The NIA has stated that since the NDA came to power, ie since 2014, no accused has been given bail in this case
 isse pehle NIA ne court main kaha tha ki maamle ke trial ko dhimaa karne ke aarope galat hai
 The affidavit stated that the allegations of Rohini Salian, former NIA lawyer who was advocating the case, were baseless and that she was pressurized to either take a soft stand on the accused or weaken the case
 enie ne apane halafanaame main ye bhi kaha ki NIA kii purv vakil rohinee salion kaa ye aarope bhi galat he ki jab wo is maamle main vishesh vakil thim to sabhi aadesh NIA ke paksh main the
 The investigating agency told the Supreme Court that out of 14 accused, 4 were granted bail between 2011 and 2013
 wo bhi tab jab rohinee is maamle ko bombai hoicourt main lead kar rahi thim
 The probe agency has given this affidavit in response to two petitions that demanded that the CBI or SIT be investigated for the allegations of Rohini Salian, former NIA lawyer
 saath hi is maamle main NIA ke liye vishesh vakil niyukt kiya jaae, taaki maamle ki nishpaksh sunwaayee ho sake
 The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear the case next week

 Satyameva Jayate ‚Äù- the truth shall prevail
 The CAG Report on Rafale reaffirms the dictum
 - Arun Jaitley (@arunjaitley) February 13, 2019 While Arun Jaitley termed it as a victory of the government, he said that the truth has come out from the CAG report

 Chidambaram (@pchidambaram_in) February 13, 2019 On the CAG report, former Union Minister p Chidambaram attacked the Modi government fiercely and said that our allegations have been proved true
 sieji report main na to koi bank guarantee kaa zikr kiya gaya he or na hi khate kii baat he
 Modi government bought an expensive aircraft and long delivery period

 Congress should refrain from attacking PM
 kendriya mantri nitin gadakari ne kaig report par ajtak se khaas baatcheet main kaha ki supreme court ne bhi saaf kar diya he
 The CAG has also made clear what was being said in its report
 deal main koi karpshan nahin hua he
 The security of our country is very important
 aise main jab desh ke paas ek bhi fiter jet nahin he aisi sthiti main aaj hamaare desh kii mahatvapurn vishyon kaa raajnneetik kaaran nahin kiya janaa chahie
 He said that this matter should be finished when the Supreme Court said it
 sieji ne yah jo report diya uske baad bhi yah vishay samaapt ho janaa chahie
 He said that now Congress should end this topic in the interest of the country
 unhone kaha ki supreme court ke nirnay ke baad jepisi nirmaan karne kaa koi prashn hi nahin uthta he
 Now the CAG report has also come that we cannot question the autonomy of any organization
 pradhanmantri jaise vyaktitv ko chor kahana sansad kii garima ke khilaaf he
 There can be difference of opinion in politics
 party kii raajnneeti alag ho sakati he
 The Prime Minister is the leader of the country, not of any party

 At the same time Bilour said that he is ready to become a criminal for this purpose

 All Creatures Great And Small provides shelter to every animal that is left to die on the road
 anjali ab tak kareeb 350 kutton ko god le chuki hai or ye aankade har roj badhate hi ja rahe hai
 The effort of this shelter is to provide shelter and food to every animal that needs it

 If we want, we can learn a lot from them

 During the Akhilesh government in Uttar Pradesh, the Bharatiya Janata Party had created a lot of ruckus about the burying of cemeteries
 itnaa hi nahin pradhanmantri narendra modi ne upi vidhansabha chunaav prachaar ke dauraan kabristaan or shmashaan kaa mudda uthaakar hindu-muslim ke bhedbhaav kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 Now in Bihar Nitish Kumar himself is making a cemetery boundary, BJP is now silent on this
 mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne haal hi main vidhansabha main kaha tha ki kabristaanon kii charadivari ke liye sarkaar ne surveykshan karaayaa he, jiske aadhaar par 8064 kabristaanon kii charadivari karai ja rahi he
 So far, 75 percent of the graveyards have been made boundary wall, while guidelines have been given to the authorities for the boundary of other cemeteries
 nitish kumaar ne kaha tha ki pradesh ke sabhi kabristaanon kii boundry hogi
 The mlas will also be able to construct the boundary wall of the cemeteries with their own private funds, but, the first priority list will be the siege of the cemeteries
 vidhayak chahen to mukhyamantri kshetra vikaas yojana se mandiron kii charadivari kaa nirmaan bhi kar sakate hai
 However, in 2006, Nitish Kumar decided to make a cemetery boundary in Bihar, in which 8064 cemeteries were to be laid siege
 maujuuda samay main kareeb 5 hajaar se zyada kabristaan kii boundry waal kaa kaam puraa ho chukaa he
 Aajtak, Chairman of Bihar JDU Minority Front and MLC Tanveer Akhtar
 in se baatcheet karte hue kaha ki endie main hone ke baavjood nitish kumaar ne alpsankhyakon ke hit ko nahin choda he
 Nitish Kumar has decided to make the graveyard boundary to protect it from land mafia
 kabristaan kii boundry ko lekar sahyogi dal bijepi ne kabhi virodh nahin kiya he
 Sushil Modi is the Finance Minister and funds are released from his ministry
 unhone bataaya ki gaya se bijepi emelsi rajan kumaar singh ne apane fund se ek kabristaan kii boundry karai he
 Tanveer Akhtar says that the root cause of the Bhagalpur riots was a graveyard dispute
 isi baat ko dhyaan main rakhte hue siem ne kabristaan kii boundry karaane kaa faisla kiya
 That is why the rule has been made to organize the boundary by mediating the district officer and SP of the cemetery where there is a dispute
 vahiin, youth congress netaa shams shahanvaaj ne sawaal karte hue kaha ki nitish sarkaar sirf prachaar kar rahi he
 It has been 12 years yet all the graveyards of Bihar have not been bound
 kya sarkaar kii praathamikta main kabristaan ki gheraabandi shaamil nahin he
 This question is because the siege of cemeteries has stopped in many districts due to lack of funds
 kai jagahon par to haalat yah he ki diwaar aadhi adhuri hi banaai gai he
 They have raised this in view of the assembly elections
 pradesh main kareeb 20 hajaar se zyada kabristaan he or sarkaar sirf 8064 kii boundry kara rahi he baaki ko bhu-maafiyon ke liye chhod diya he
 The BJP has never opposed the cemetery boundaries in Bihar
 jabaki uttar pradesh main bijepi ne 2017 kaa vidhansabha chunaav isi mudde par ladaa tha or akhilesh yadav par hindu-muslim ke bich bhedbhaav kaa aarope bhi lagaaya tha, lekin bihar maamle par khamosh he

 After the editorship of SP Patron Mulayam Singh Yadav, the party president Akhilesh Yadav has decided the OBC conference
 sapa pradesh ke ek-ek jilon main jaakar pichhadaa varg sammelan karke unhen saath jodne kii koshish karegi
 The leaders of the backward class, including Daya Ram Prajapati, the backward class cell president of the party, have been engaged in it

 The Congress has started the process of ticket distribution in the year-end assembly elections in Chhattisgarh

 Out of these, the claim of the family members of former Assembly Speaker Rajendra Prasad Shukla is being considered strong
 isse saaf he ki is baar renu jogi ko kota vidhansabha seat se tikat milanaa mushkil he
 Regarding this seat of MLA Renu Jogi, Congress state president Bhupesh Baghel argues that Renu Jogi, being the current MLA, has the right to present his claim
 unke mutabik jahaan tak tikat dene yaa naa dene kaa sawaal he, yah gun-dosha ke aadhaar par tay hoga
 In fact, not only while breaking ties with Congress, but on several occasions, Ajit Jogiyeh has declared that his wife Renu Jogi and they have a relationship of 40 years
 isliye ve unheen ke saath jaaengi
 In such a situation, with the decision of Renu Jogi to claim the ticket for the third time from the Congress, the eyes of the people are resting on the steps of Ajit Jogi

 Among these names, only clean image and winning candidates will be preferred

 The Supreme Court said that when there is no law in your state, why did you not adopt the law of the Central Government?

 Questioning the Supreme Court, why does it happen that in most of the cases, the lawyers presented by the UP government do not have any proper instructions from the authority concerned? In a case related to the management of the nearly 300-year-old Sri Sarvamangala Devi Bela Bhawani temple in Bulandshahr, Vijay Pratap Singh has filed a petition in the Supreme Court challenging the order of the Allahabad High Court in which the temple offerings were given to the pandas working there

 BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi has been making revelations for the last 15 days on Rashtriya Janata Dal supremo Lalu Prasad and his family for acquiring crores of benami property
 kis tareeke se lalu ne farji companiyon ke raste benami sampatti jamaa kii, isko lekar susheel modi ne thos dastavej bhi pesh kiye hai
 In the same sequence, Sushil Modi made another disclosure on Tuesday in which he told how Lalu and his family acquired benami property and how Lalu has benami assets worth nearly 1000 crores today? Learn Sushil Modi's story of Lubi and his family acquiring benami property
 1
 In 2006, liquor mafia Om Prakash Katyal opened a company called AK Infosystems Pvt Ltd with the main objective of accumulating benami property for Laloo and his family
 2
 In March 2007, the company purchased about 31000 sq ft of land at two places in Patna, Panapur and Chitkohra, for which they paid Rs 39 lakh
 3
 In 2006, Rabri Devi's brother Prabhunath Yadav gave a gift of 14 lakhs of property, including land and a house, to Tejashwi and Tej Pratap
 4
 After 4 years, AK INFOSYSTEMS bought the land from Tejashwi and Tej Pratap and paid Rs 70 lakh to the two brothers
 is tareeke se gift kii hui jameen ke donon bhaaiyon ko 70 lakh rupye bhi mil gaye or AK Infosystems naam kii company is jameen kaa maalik ban gai
 5
 2014 main, katyaal parivaar, jisane AK Infosystems Pvt Ltd naam kii company kholi thi, vah is company se alag ho gaye or is company ke saare shairelalu or unke parivaaravaalon ke naam par transfar ho gaye
 At present, Rabri Devi owns 85 per cent and the stunning 15 per cent share in this company, while Lalu's two daughters Chanda and Ragini are the only two directors in the company
 6
 With the transfer of this company by the Katyal family to the Lalu family, not only did Lalu and the family get Rs 70 lakh of the gifted land, but the land that the company owned was returned to Lalu's family
 7
 Sushil Modi alleged that the Katyal family opened a liquor factory in Patna's Son area when Rabri Devi was the chief minister between 2000 and 2005 and in return the Katyal family opened a fake company and earned benami property for Lalu & Family
 Started doing modi ke anusaar lalu ke paas aaj ke din takreeban 1000 crores rupye kii benami sampatti he
 Modi has demanded that Chief Minister Nitish Kumar take cognizance of this benami property of Lalu and start an investigation against him
 modi ne kaha ki agar aisa nahin hota he to vah is maamle ko lekar iskar vibhaag, pravartan nideshaalay or sibiai main shikaayat karenge
 Usually, what do spouses do when they want to indicate where their relationship is moving now? Either they send each other chocolate and send whatsapp emojis to each other to indicate that they want to kiss each other and move towards agreement
 yaa phir unke matbhed samay ke saath or gahraate jate hai or ve aupchaarik rup se ek-duusare se alag hone ke liye adaalat kaa rukh kar lete hai
 Till a week ago, the relationship between India and the United States was seen to be similar to that seen in married couples moving towards divorce
 narendra modi ne duusare kaarykaal ke liye pradhanmantri ke rup main shapath lee hi thi ki agle hi din 31 may ko, america ke raashtrapati donald trump ne unka majaa kharaab kar diya
 Trump announced that they were moving forward with their order to withdraw preferential rates received by India under the US Generalized System of Preference (GSP)
 vajah? modi sarkaar ne ''america ko aashwaasan nahin diya ki bharat apane bazaaron tak uski nyaaysangat or uchit pahunch pradaan karegaa
 "india has been preferred under the US GSP since 1976
 2018 main, bharat ko niryaat kiye gaye saamaan kaa 12 fisad yani 6
 There was a profit of 3 billion dollars
 haalanki iske tahat milane vaali duty kii riyaayaten pichley saal keval 24 karod dollar kii thim, lekin 5 june se prabhavi hue jiespi visheshadhikaron kii vaapasi se bharat ke kareeb 1,900 utpaadon ke niryaat ko maar jhelni padegi
 On June 15, a fortnight after Trump's action, India responded by imposing high tariffs on 29 items imported from the US, including apples, almonds, walnuts, chickpeas, lentils and boric acid
 masalan, baadaam par seemaa shulk main 20 pratishat kii badhotaree kii gai
 Last year, India scored 54
 3 karod dollar mulya ke baadaam kharide
 This is half of America's total almond exports
 matlab yah ki is shulk vruddhi se america baadaam utpaadakon ko nuksaan hoga
 In fact, India announced higher taxes on these products in June 2018 as the US increased duty on India's steel by 25 percent and for aluminum imports by 10 percent
 lekin bharat ne shulk vruddhi kii koi karrwai nahin kii kyonki use baatcheet ke jariye matbhedon ke sulajhane kii ummid thi
 Meanwhile, India took the US to the Dispute Settlement Body of the World Trade Organization (WTO) for violating tariff norms
 donon desh ke bich sirf vyapaarik morche par hi tanatani nahin thi
 In the last two years, disputes between the two have arisen over a range of issues such as India's oil imports from Iran, defense purchases from Russia, the issuance of US work visas to Indians and the proposed new e-commerce policy of the Modi government
 i-commers niti ke bare main to america kaa tark he ki aisa amejan, walmart or google jaise america diggaj companiyon ko nuksaan main daalane ke liye kiya gaya he (dekhen, gatirodh ke mudde)
 There are other issues like the sale of Lincoln House in Mumbai which need to be resolved
 linkan house ko dashakon pehle america vaanijya duutavas ko lij par diya gaya tha
 When the embassy wanted to sell it to a prominent Indian industrialist for Rs 750 crore in 2015, the central government objected and so far has not approved the sale
 vidambnaa yah he ki yah sab tab ho rahaa he jabaki donon desh raksha, aatankwaad, samudri niyamon or dakshin asian kshetra ke saath america judaav jaise ranneetik muddon par ek duusare ke zyada kareeb aae hai
 But the two countries are willing to dissolve sweetness in their relationship, the new Secretary of State for US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo
 jaishankar se or phir, 26 june ko modi ke saath mulaakaat se hi jaahir he
 As Pompeo explained in a special conversation with India Today, "we talked about how we can make this time, this time different
" ham apane rishte main adhik mahatvakankshi ho sakate hai
 We can look at the positive aspects of trade, military, defense cooperation issues
 is bare main patibadghta vaastavik he
 This is a deep understanding of how our countries can work together
 aaj meri yahaan ke netritv se baatcheet kaa labbolubaab yahi he ki hamaare donon deshon ke logon, is kshetra or samoochee duniya ke bhale ke liye, america or bharat ko achche saajheedaar bane rahanaa jaruri he
 We will benefit from India and India from us
 '' (dekhen baatcheet, 'kisi desh ko apana chaha sab kuch nahin mil paata')jaishankar ne bhi baatcheet main sakaaratmak maahaul kii pushti kii
 He said, "on some old issues, especially business related issues, i urged that we take a constructive and practical approach
 yah swaabhaavik he ki jab aap vyapaar kar rahe hote hai to usamen kuch vivaad bhi honge hi or mujhe lagata he ki hamaari manshaa kii vaastavik pariksha un vivaadon ko prabhavi dhang se sambodhit karne kii hamaari kshamta se hoti he
 On the same night, Modi left for Osaka, Japan to attend the G-20 summit where he is to have a bilateral meeting with Trump to discuss the deadlock
 lekin, donon deshon ke bich aapasi vivaad ke jitne vishay hai, unhen dekhte hue donon netaaon kaa aapas main gale mil lenaa paryaapt na hoga, usase kahin adhik khule dil kii aavashyaktaa hogi
 So, despite the initial promises, why do such a round of sour relations arise between the world's largest democracy and the world's most powerful country? And what needs to be done to ease the relationship back? Disappearing Warmth Let's first understand how the mess happened
 jab trump ne janvari 2017 main raashtrapati kaa padbhaar sambhala, to bharat-america sambandh ek dashak se adhik lambey samay se bahut madhur chale aa rahe the or donon desh ek duusare ke 'ranneetik saajhedaar' ban gaye the
 a new twist in the high-profile relationship between the two countries came in October 2008 when President George W
W
 bush or pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne bharat-america asainya parmaanu qaraar par hastakshar kiye
 This opened the way for the removal of restrictions on the supply of nuclear power and technology to India, which were imposed by the big Western superpowers after India's nuclear tests in 1974 and 1998
 isse bharat or america ke rishton kii raah main khadi baari aadchan bhi dur hui
 Since then, the graph of trade between the two countries has started growing, which according to a former US ambassador to India was "flat as chapati"
 pichley saal vyapaar 142 arab dollar ko chhu gaya
 This year the US again overtook China in terms of India's trade partner
 parmaanu qaraar ke baad bharat ko ucch america raksha upkarnon kii bikri kii raah bhi khuli
 Since 2008, total purchases from the US have now reached $ 20 billion
 2014 main jab modi satta main aae to unhone jaldi hi baraak obama se dostana rishta bana liya or donon deshon ke rishton ko aage le jane kii disha main kadam badaye
 On June 8, 2016, while addressing a joint session of the US Parliament, he had said that the two countries had finally "succeeded in breaking the hesitation of history"
 apane chunaav prachaar ke dauraan trump ne bharat ke prati sakaaratmak rukh dikhaaya or kaha ki ve us desh ke ''bade mureed'' hai or ''ham achche dost banane ja rahe hai
 "trump then called Modi" the great Prime Minister of India and a pro-development leader
 '' bharat haalanki trump ko lekar bahut satark rahaa he kyonki unhone america hiton ko sarvopari rakhane or us lakshya ko praapt karne ke liye maujuuda vishwa vyavastha ko palat dene kaa vaada kiya tha
 An Indian expert expresses the trump theory as three 'd's': disengages (break relationships), deglobalize (change globalization) and disorient (break)
 trump se pinge badhaane ke saath, bharat shuru main dekho or intjaar karo niti par chalaa or faisla kiya ki jab tak trump prashasan aage nahin badhata, khamosh raho
 From the day he assumed power, Trump had indicated that he would take his campaign forward
 unhone 12 deshon ke bich prastaavit vyapaar samjhaute, trans-pacific partnership ko ''bura sauda'' bataakar america ko usase alag kar liya
 He then rescinded the nuclear deal with Iran, which Obama called under the Joint Comprehensive Action Plan (JCPOA) for Iran and the P-5 + 1 (five permanent members of the UN Security Council ‚Äî the US, China, France, Britain and Britain Germany)
 unhone paris jalwaayu parivartan sandhi ko bemaani bataa diya or ghoshnaa kii ki america iske tahat apni patibaddhtaon kaa sammaan nahin karegaa
 He then openly waged a trade war with China
 china kaa 2018 main america ke saath 419 arab dollar kaa anukool vyapaar santulan tha
 Trump also slammed the partners of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), asking that all NATO expenses be equaled
 june 2017 main jab trump pehali baar modi se white house main mili the, to lag rahaa tha ki donon ke bich mithaas ho gai he or america raashtrapati ne kaha tha ki ve bharat ko ''sachcha dost'' maanate hai or modi unke gale lag gaye the
 All the major issues between the two ‚Äî defense, trade, security and multilateral relations ‚Äî were talked about expanding, but Trump said, "the barriers that stand in the way of the export of American goods to your market need to be removed so that we can protect your country
" Simultaneously reduce trade deficit
 '' yah baat halke main nahin kahi gai thi
 But New Delhi had mistakenly assumed that Trump would not favor a mere $ 24 billion trade deficit with India over his $ 400 billion trade deficit with China
 bharat-america sambandhon ke ek visheshgy kehete hai, ''trump ke liye, vyapaar unki praathamikta suchi main pehle se paanchaven sthaan tak he or ve is par jaraa-sa bhi jhukne ko taiyaar nahin hai
 Indian officials could not keep up with this reality and did not realize that the way they did not take the words of Trump's earlier presidents very seriously, that strategy would not go with Trump
 ''ek vicitra dwandwaisamen puri tarah se bharat kii hi galati nahin thi
 The Trump administration has run its relations with India with a strange duel that convinced Indian policy-makers that they could proceed with the US president in the same manner as Obama's era
 trump bharat ke saath vyapaar ke morche par tikhe tevar dikhaate rahe lekin jab raksha kharid kii baat ai, to unhone bharat ko stritegic trade othrigeshan tear van yaa estie-1 kaa darja diya
 This allowed American arms manufacturers to sell India the technology that the US had not even given to some of its closest allies
 carnegi andoument for international pis ke varisht sahyogi ashley telis kehete hai, ''donald trump prashasan kaa bharat ke saath sambandhon ko lekar ek sanakeepan vaala drushtikon rahaa he
 It wants to work with India on a strategic dimension as Bush and Obama did but on the other hand, it sees India as a trade competitor
 pichhali sarkaron ne bharat ke saath apane aarthik hiton ke liye apane ranneetik hiton ko santulit karne ke tareeke khoje the
 The Trump administration considers India as an economic problem for the US and takes advantage of its strategic relationship with it
 ''trump jo riyaayaten maang rahe the, unhen pradaan karne ke faisle par bharat teji se aage badaae ke liye taiyaar nahin tha or america raashtrapati ne farvari 2018 main apane gusse kaa saarvajanik rup se izhaar kar diya
 He said, "you look at India, Prime Minister Modi is a very good friend of mine but if you take a look you will find that he has imposed 100 percent tax on American motorcycles (imports)
" ham un par koi shulk nahin lagaate hai
 And when Harley (davidson) sends his motorbike there, they tax it 100 percent
 ve bhi baari sankhya main motorcycilen banaate hai or unhen hamaare yahaan bhejte hai, lekin ham unase koi kar nahin lete
 i called him (modi)
 maine kaha, yah nahin chalegaa
 He reduced the tax on a phone call to 50 percent
 maine kaha, yah bhi asweekaarya he kyonki ham aapse koi kar nahin lete to aap 50 pratishat kyon lenge
 "later, an internal White House report revealed that India was at the top of the tariff countries, while Trump described India as" a tariff king "
 bharat ne america ko tab or adhik naaraaz kiya jab modi sarkaar ne apane pehle kaarykaal main america se aaayaatit chikitsa upkarnon, vishesh rup se stant kii keemton ko niyantrit karne kaa nirnay liya
 There was joy in India, but American producers were most unhappy with it
 unhone is mulya niyantran tantra ko anuchit bataaya or vyapaar karne main asamarthta jaahir kii
 It was said that this would lead to a drop in US foreign direct investment in India as the government is implementing unexpected rules
 lekin mulya niyantran hataane par lambii baatcheet ke baad bhi bharat peeche hatane ko raji nahin hua
 His displeasure was further heightened when India decided to impose 30 per cent customs duty on IVD (in-vitro diagnostics) reactants
 bharat salanaa 6,000 karod rupye se adhik mulya ke in riegents kaa aayaat karata he, jisamen america companiyon kaa hissaa 36 pratishat he
 In the dairy sector, India refused permission to export American milk and milk products, provided that American companies did not certify that "milch animals were not given internal organs, blood-fed food, and tissues of ruminant origin as food
" went
 '' kendriya vaanijya mantralay kaa rukh is baat ko lekar spasht tha ki america niryaatkon ke liye koi vishesh chhot nahin di jaaegi kyonki isse janata kii dharmik bhavanaaen judi hai
 Meanwhile, the US government also demanded that India reduce rates on seven tariff lines, including smart watch, mobile phone and telecom network equipment
 bharat ne tark diya ki aisa gharelu nirmaataaon ke liye vyapaar main barabari kaa maahaul taiyaar karne kii aavashyaktaaon ke kaaran nahin kiya ja saktaa
 3 annually to India with a 20 percent import duty on these goods
 2 arab dollar kaa rajasav praapt hota he
 Washington was visibly disappointed by New Delhi's stance and a trade official commented, "there was a lot that could be cleared
" choti chizon par aasaani se hal nikaala ja saktaa tha
 Now the danger has arisen that the fire will erupt and end the entire relationship
 ''anuchit aropabharat kaa vaanijya mantralay haalanki apane rukh ko yah kehete hue sahi tehraata he ki america, bharat par galat tareeke se haaavee hone kii koshish kar rahaa he
 Since Trump took office in 2017, the trade deficit has fallen by more than $ 3 billion
 adhikari bataate hai ki bharat ko america hathiyaaron kii aapurti lagaataar bad rahi he or ek varsh main ausatan 2 arab dollar kaa kaarobaar hota he jo vyapaar ke aankadon main nahin aata he
 In the next five years, India is about to sign a $ 25 billion arms deal, which India wants to sign only for the purchase of American aircraft (see, military shopping list)
 phir america un kai vastuon ke aayaat kii bhi ginati nahin kar rahaa he jo bharat anya deshon se aayaat karata he or jinamein america avyavon kaa baari maatra main prayog hota he jisase apratyaksh rup se america arthvyavastha ko laabh pahunchataa he
 In addition, more than 1,80,000 Indian students go there every year to study in American universities and spend more than $ 10 billion annually
 vah bhi dwipaksheeya balance shit main nahin gina jaataa he
 India says that the duty it imposes on the goods is approved by the WTO based on the countries' ability to generate revenue

 or ve jis tarah se chizon ko lekar chal rahe hai, kisi bhi desh ko americanyon ke prati koi sahanubhuti nahin bachi he
 "trade is not the only issue of sourness
" iran ke saath vyapaar karne vaale kisi bhi desh par america ke pratibandhon kaa khamiyaja bhi bharat ko bhugatna padaa
 10 percent of India's total oil imports come from Iran and the US had given a six-month exemption for Delhi until an alternative source was found
 pichley maheene, america ne aisi sabhi chhuton ko samaapt kar diya, jisase bharat anya deshon se ucch keemton par tel lene ke liye majaboor ho gaya
 When Pompeo was in Delhi, Jaishankar underlined India's energy needs as India meets 80 percent of its energy needs through imports
 vivaad kaa doosraa bada kaaran rus se bharat kaa hathiyaar aayaat he, khaskar pichley saal aktubar main hua es-400 missile sauda
 Here, the US has also banned the country buying arms from Russia
 usne dhamkee di he ki america pratibandh ko dhata bataane vaale desh ko america apane unnat hathiyaar nahin bechega
 India was refusing to cancel the deal because it has old ties with Russia and India has sought a waiver on these restrictions from the US President
 poquipayo apni yatra main is maamle main koi vaada karne ko taiyaar nahin the, lekin sanket hai ki agar bharat america ko anya chizon main riyaayat de to isaki chhot mil sakati he
 India does not seem keen on its side moving too close to the US
 iskaa sabase bada kaaran yah he ki modi kaa aisa maananaa he ki ubharate hue antarrashtriya paridrishyon main vishwa bahudhruviya hoga or bharat ke liye har dhruv ke saath mitrataa banaae rakhane main phayda he
 For this, India will have to improve relations with some, but it should also be seen that relations with anyone should not be spoiled
 america yah chahta he ki china ke saath uske vyapaar yuddh main bharat saath de lekin nai dilli kii niti spasht he ki beijing ke saath uske sambandh apane str par paribhaashit honge
 However, Washington is also irritated by the fact that the Modi government is moving ahead to resolve its disputes with China, but India does not show the same readiness to consider American demands
 sambandhon kaa sakaaratmak paksh he ki trump prashasan ne pakistan se hone vaale aatank ko lekar bharat kii chintaaon kaa joardaar samarthan kiya or islamabad ko chetavanee di ki vah seemaa paar hamalon ko bardaasht nahin karegaa
 Significantly, during the Balakot attacks, the US supported India's stand
 i-commers kaa bhootbharat kii haal hi main draft kii gai i-commers policy ko lekar america chintaaen badi hai
 The US has expressed displeasure over India's trade with Chinese telecom giant Huawei as the US has banned Huawei for security reasons

 ''modi videsh mantri ke rup main purv videsh sachiv jaishankar ko niyukt karke america se nipatane ke liye ek visheshgy bhi lekar aae hai
 In negotiations with Pompio, both can come up with a solution that will be a win for both countries
 jaisaa ki telis kahata he, ''trump kuch vishisht muddon par santushti chaahate hai
 Now the question is, how hard is it really for India to fulfill his wishes? i think even if India needs to step back a few steps to resolve specific issues and keep its relationship with the US sweet, it will not be a bad investment for India
 ''pompiyo ke prayaas baatcheet main sakaaraatmakataa ko darshaate hai or bharat ke saath apane ranneetik sambandhon ko badhaane ke liye america kii utsukata ko doharaaya gaya he
 a senior Indian diplomat, who was involved in the meetings, observed, "pompeo was moving towards cordial negotiations and never gave any indication of dominance
 badi baat yah he ki america ne yah bataa diya ki bharat ke saath sambandh uske liye mahatvapurn he

 ) (except for the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it is published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) There is a discussion in the government corridors that this year the Estate Duty or Inheritance Tax may be reimposed in the budget
 vipaksh is par etraz kar rahaa he jabaki arthshaastriyon kaa kahana he ki isse saamaajik vishmata ghategi
 The challenge is to raise money in front of the government
 somvaar ko aae aankade bataa rahe hai ki do maheenon main jiesti collection ausatan kareeb 14,000 karod maheene kam ho gaya
 According to the information given by the Finance Ministry, the total GST collection in April 2019 was 1,13,865 crore, which has increased to 1,00,289 in May 2019 and has come down to 99,939 crore in June 2019
 ab khabar ye he ki nae nivesh ke liye zaruri sansaadhan jutaney ke raste khoj rahi sarkaar Estate Duty yaa Inheritance Tax phir se laane par vichaar kar rahi he
 This tax is actually levied on ancestral property
 ise 1953 main pehali baar bharat main lagu kiya gaya or ye kareeb 32 saal desh main lagu rahaa
 In fact, the tax litigation over this tax was so much that it was abolished in 1985
 saaf he ye vikalp ek mushkil vikalp sabit hota rahaa he or ab dekhnaa hoga ki vitt mantralay is bare main aage kya faisla karata he
 According to t Haq, chairman, NITI Aayog's expert committee on land matters, 58% of the people in India currently control wealth
 aise logon par Inheritance Tax lagaana chahie
 tax-gdp ratio in India is low
 use badhanaa jaruri he
 Inheritance tax will help reduce social inequality in India
 sanjay sharma, asistant secretary general, asocham ne kaha - ham confident ki vitt mantralay saare stekholderon se salaah ke baad nayaa tex prapojal taiyaar kar rahaa he
 Is the question
 
 
 agar ye prastaav bajet 2019 main shaamil kiya jaataa he to kya ye vipaksh ko manzur hoga? kuch vipakshi saansad ye maanate hai ki jo tex 1985 main khatm kiya gaya use 34 saal baad phir lagu karnaa galat hoga
 
 
 The government should consider new options to increase tax collection and not by imposing new taxes
 
 
 pratap singh bajva, congress saansad, rajya sabha ne kaha - 34 saal baad Inheritance Tax ko phir rivive karnaa galat hoga
 This will be a matter of defacing the mandate received by the Modi government
 aazam khan, saansad, samaajawaadee party - 1985 main Inheritance Tax ko jo abolish kiya gaya wo galat tha? Inheritance Tax ko phir rivive karnaa galat hoga
 The government should find new avenues for revenue generation
 saaf he
 
 
 The Finance Minister will have to move forward by creating the needs of the economy and creating political balance

 Despite being a great love story, the collection of the film at the box office is not what it was expected to be due to ipl
 shoojit sarkaar kii is film ko box offis par shuruaati dinon main kaaphi shandaar rispons mila
 But due to the IPL General Assembly, now the film's earnings growth is being seen only on weekends
 
 Avengers Infinity war vs IPL 2018 Now it remains to be seen whether the Avengers will be able to get their old charm in the Indian audience due to IPL
 kyonki avengers kii pichhali filmon kii box offis kamai kaaphi shandaar rahi thi yanha tak ki avengers kii puraani siris pehle hi box offis par bollywood filmon ke record tod chuki he
 The film avengers-age of Ultron, released in 2015, grossed Rs 77 crore in India
 agar is baar bhi avengers ke saath koi bollywood film relies hoti he to jaahir si baat he in filmon kaa bijness bantna tay he
 Because apart from the Avengers, many other hit Hollywood movies have been seen in India
 aisi kai shandaar hollywood filmein hai jinhon bollywood box par shandaar kamai kii
 Such as: Black Panther (2018) - 38 Crores Released in India (2017) Hollywood Film Revenue Figures in indiaanabel: Creation - 44 Crores GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY VOL 2-21

 The thrill of the audience is increasing with every match of IPL
 to kya aise main avengers kii nai film ko darshakon kaa bharpoor pyaar mil paaegaa? kya vaaki IPL is film ke bijness par asar daalega? in sawaalon ke jawaab is film ke opening or weekend collection se mil hi jaaenge
 This time, this time Hollywood is not facing Bollywood but IPL
 IPL VS Avengers ke mukaable main koun vinar hoga isaki report to box offis de hi dekha
 With this, it is now up to the Indians to decide whether they like to see their cricket heroes first or the heroes of the Avengers
 bataa den Avengers infinity war film bharat main 27 april ko relies hone ja rahi he or IPL 2018 kaa final 27 may ko he

 During the hearing on Thursday, Professor's wife Pushpa Rawatani told the court that the professor had challenged an appointment by filing a PIL in the High Court, but the High Court ordered that she should file a writ, not public interest
 
 But the professor did not follow this order and kept sending letters against the bench to the High Court judges alleging corruption
 itnaa hi nahin, unhone apane haathon par bhi tatu banavaa liya
 The High Court on April 4 sentenced him to three months in jail under contempt and ordered to surrender four weeks later

 '--- Input from IANS desh ke pehle pradhanmantri jawahar laal nehru ke pita or swatantraaa senaanee moti laal nehru kaa nidhan saal 1931 main 06 farvari ko hua tha
 Learn about Moti Lal Nehru's life
 
 
 moti laal nehru kaa janm 6 may 1861 ko hua tha
 His father's name was Gangadhar Nehru, who died three months before the birth of Moti Lal Nehru
 moti laal ne cambridge uniwarsity se 'baar ait lau' kiya or kanpur main ek loyr ke taur par practice bhi kiya
 Later he moved to Allahabad
 moti laal nehru kaa naam desh ke sabase bade vakeelon main shumaar kiya jaataa rahaa he
 In 1900, he bought a huge mansion in the Civil Lines, Allahabad, named Anand Bhavan
 baad main is bhawan ko indira gandhi ne bhartiya sarkaar ko saunp diya tha, jisamen sangrahalay kholaa gaya
 Motilal Nehru was the President of the Congress twice during 1919 to 1920 and 1928 to 1929
 1920 main kalakatta ke special congress ke dauraan wo pehali pankti ke netaa the, jinhone asahyog andolan ko apana samarthan diya tha
 During Ghulam Bharat he wrote the Nehru Report, which is believed to be the first written constitution of any Indian
 is report main bharat ko aaazaad desh ke rup main dekhne kii avadharana di gai thi
 Motilal Nehru College of Delhi University is named after him
 kya narayan sai sach bolegaa? kya narayan sai ikbaal-e-jurm karegaa? kya narayan sai apane har gunaah kaa raaj fash karegaa? philhal surat police ke saamne narayan sai kii jo surat-e-haal he usase to aisa katai nahin lagata
 Surat police say that Narayan Sai is very vicious and is constantly trying to mislead the police
 lihaaja ab surat police ne tay kiya he ki police hiraasat main agle chah dinon tak narayan sai se jo bhi poochtacha kii jaaegi wo sab camere main kaid hoga
 If the Surat Police extricated the entire truth from Narayan Sai in the next 6 days, then the fate of Sai would not be separated from his father Asaram
 balki mumkin he ki anjaam baap se bhi bura ho
 Because whatever Narayan Sai says now in front of Surat Police, whatever will arise will be captured in the camera
 darasal surat police ne faisla kiya he ki agle chah dinon kii police hiraasat ke dauraan wo narayan sai se sari poochtacha camere par karegi
 So that later on reaching the court, he cannot turn from his crimes
 narayan sai bhi kam hoshiyaar nahin he
 He knows that confession on camera will get him behind bars for a lifetime
 isiilie surat police kii maane to philhal hiraasat main hone ke baavjood poochtacha main wo police kii madad nahin kar rahaa
 Rather constantly trying to strangle the police
 surat police sutron ke mutabik narayan sai lagaataar police se yahi kah rahaa he ki wo bekasoor he or use sajeesh ke tahat fansaaya ja rahaa he
 But the Surat police say that they have so much of the rough-and-tumble of the sins of Narayan Sai that they will not be able to turn over the police for much longer
 surat police ke mutabik surat kii do bahanon ne jin tarikhon kaa hawala diya tha, jis jagah kaa zikr kiya tha or jin logon ke gavaah hone kii baat kahi thi wo sari chijen sahi pai gai hai
 That is, his accusation of rape is not wrong
 bas police sari kadiyon ko jodakar sai ko gherne kii taiyaari kar rahi he
 According to the police, there is so much evidence against Narayan Sai that even after trying, he could not get them to lie
 sai ko pukhta taur par gherne ke liye hi surat police ab adaalat se ijaajat lekar uskaa diene test, narko or potency test karaane kii taiyaari kar rahi he
 a police team is also examining the documents which he found during the raid at Narayan Sai's Ahmedabad ashram
 sutron ke mutabik in dastavejon main karodon rupayon kii avaidh tranjection kii jaankaree he or ab police is baat kaa pataa lagane main juty he ki aakhir itnaa paisa narayan sai ko kisne diya or narayan sai ne is paise kaa istemaal kahaan-kahaan kiya
 Apart from those two sisters from Surat, police are also looking for the girls from whom she has children
 surat police ne narayan sai se poochtacha ke liye sawaalon kii ek lambii chaudee list taiyaar kii he
 But Narayan Sai is not ready to open his mouth
 police ke mutabik wo poochtacha main jaraa bhi sahyog nahin kar rahaa he
 Whenever the police ask him a question, he gives the answers to the person who is driving it
 lihaaja narayan sai se sach ugalvaane ke liye police uske saamne kuch aise logon ko laane kii taiyaari kar rahi he, jiske baad sach or jhooth kaa faisla apane aap ho jayega
 For the entire 58 days, Narayan Sai wandered, hid in six different states of the country
 jaahir he is dauraan anginat logon ne uski madad kii hogi, use panaah di hogi
 Now all those people will also be included in this affair
 police narayan sai se uske 58 dinon ke hisaab-kitaab ke saath-saath un tamaam thikaanon ke pate bhi nikaal rahi he

 Some would like it, some would be humble, but Sisodia explains the difference between the work done in the country so far and the work done during the last four and a half years in the capital, "IIM, University of Delhi, Banaras Hindu University, We have not opened many more big institutes like IIT, our government has no contribution in making education fundamental

 This book also shares the grief and pain of teachers, targeting the education system that is playing with the future of children
 shikshakon ke jariye karwaae ja rahe sarkari kaamon kaa zikr karte hue lekhak bataata he ki kis tarah shikshakon ko sarkari yojanaon ko ghar-ghar tak pahunchane kaa jariyabar bana diya gaya he
 Teachers engaged in surveys ranging from census to voter cards have no time left for studies
 shikshakon kii kshamta ke vikaas ke liye jaruri prashikshan vyavastha par bhi lekhak ne khub jor diya he
 While on the one hand this book goes into detail about the syllabus introduced by the parents' participation in children's education, the art of being happy, and preparing the entrepreneurs for the new phase of preparation, while the state's education system in it There is also mention of further plans for haalanki shiksha ke bahaane is pustak main jahaan-tahaan siyaasi ulahne bhi padhgaye ko milte hai
 The lines weighed against its predecessor governments and the current central government dilute the author's claim that the book is written not with an electoral advantage but with a view to presenting a better model of education
 lekin iskaa yah katai matlab nahin ki is baat se pustak kii upyogita kam ho jaati he

 The focus is only on victory, although this may be Afghanistan's first Test match, but Rahane stressed the need to show 'ruthlessness' against any Test team, even if it was not his debut match
 rahane ne kaha, ‚Äòham afghanistan ko halke se nahin le rahe hai
 His team is very good
 unke paas achche gendbaaj hai
 "rahane said," As a team, we cannot take anything for granted because cricket is a game of uncertainties
 hamen maidan par nirmamata dikhaani hogi
 Yes, we respect him as an opponent, but it is important for us that we get more than 100 percent on the field
 hamen nirmam hone kii jarurat he
 "we have Rahane, like veteran spinner Dinesh Karthik, not paying attention to Afghanistan captain Asghar Stanikzai's statement that their spinners are better than India's Ravichandran Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja and Kuldeep Yadav
" rahane ne kaha, ‚Äòprayek sadsy yah vishwaas karnaa chahega ki unki team acchhee he
 We all know about statistics, but we do not want to pay attention to statistics
 aswin, jadeja or kuldeep anbhavi spinner hai
 On any given day your mindset makes a difference
 ‚Äôrahane ne kaha ki pichley teen din lambey formet ke anuroop khud ko dhaalane ke lihaaj se mahatvapurn rahe
 He said, 'we attended two practice sessions in Bangalore and it was fantastic
 ipel ke baad yah mahatvapurn tha ki ham apni maansikta badalen
 We are not taking Afghanistan lightly
