 On the cancellation of the rally in Jadhavpur, Shah said, 'I came to Jayanagar, but in the second place was the seat of Mamata Didi's nephew

 He fears that if the BJP people gather, the nephew's throne will be turned upside down

 "article 25 requires all constitutional courts to provide protection to personal law rather than to draw loopholes in them
 personal lau ke maamle main dakhlandaazi nyaayik pareekshan ke daayre ke baahar kii chiz he
 "this line in Hindi is a translation of that line written in English by Chief Justice Kehar and Justice Abdul Nazeer in their August 2017 judgment
 jis faisale se ek baar main teen talaak par roak lagi thi
 This decision makes it clear that personal law has constitutional protection
 personal lau sirf musalamaanon ke nahin hote hai
 There are also other religions
 supreme court ne us faisale main ek baar main yani ek jatke main teen talaaq par roak lagaai thi
 There are no three divorces in the Quran
 talaak kii behad vyavasthit prakriya he
 Women are given more rights at every stage of this process
 isliye koran main talaaq kii kai vidhi he or unki kai prakriyaayein hai
 The Supreme Court has not interfered in all those statutes
 unhen yathaavat rahane diya he
 Even triple talaq is not considered illegal
 koran ke mutabiq bataai kai prakriya ke tahat teen baar main talaaq die ja sakate hai
 Just three divorces at a time will not result in divorce
 teen talaaq par aapaki raay hogi
 Must be there
 magar kuch sawaal khud se karen
 How is your opinion formed? kya iske liye aapane supreme court kaa 395 pannon kaa faisalaa padhaa he? kya aapane is par kai tarah ke lekh padhe hai jo mehnat se paksh-vipaksh main likhe gaye hon yaa phir bhi aapane whats ap uniwarsity kii vidhi kaa sahaara liya he? agar aapane apni raay chaahe paksh main ho yaa vipaksh main news channelon ke aadhaar par banaai he to aapako shame aani chahie
 You did not work hard to form an opinion on such a big public issue
 teen talaaq par kitni bahes hui he
 Debates on this subject have been carried out on every other third evening on news channels
 sansad main hui he
 It took place in the Supreme Court
 yah aapke vivek ke sammaan kaa prashn he
 How you enrich your conscience, how much labor you do for it depends on how hard you work before participating in a public issue
 yah sawaal modi samarthakon se bhi he or modi virodhiyon se bhi he
 We often understand Muslim personal law as law because there is law in it
 yah lau nahin he
 Explanation of rules and instructions
 jo koi bhi parampara, vivek yaa pavitra qitaab ke aadhaar par karata he
 Article 26 does not only preserve the freedom of religions but it also preserves a sect
 aap kisi sampradaay par kisi dharm vishesh kii vyapak panrapara yaa dharmik nirdeshon ko nahin thope sakate hai
 Hopefully you understand the difference between sect and religion
 faizan mustafaa ne likhaa he ki british bharat main jab The Dissolution of Muslim Marriage Act 1939 tha
 This act was passed under the influence of the Maulanas of Hanifa School who followed the Maliki law
 us vakt unhone teen talaak par koi taarkik stand nahin liya jo zyaada udaaravaadi mat rakhte the
 The reasons why he did not do so are not clear
 agar shuru se hi yah spashtataa hoti to yah sankat yahaan tak nahin aata
 Looking at the process of triple talaq mentioned in the Qur'an, it seems that all the laws of divorce in any constitutional law, the effect of the Qur'an will be visible on them
 kyonki iske pehle kisi dharm vishesh ke kisi mukhya granth main auraton ko kai kaarnon se asafal vivaah se nikalne ke itane raste nahin bataae gaye hai
 This is my opinion even though i am not an expert in all religious texts
 sanvaidhanik kanoon bhi talaaq kaa faisalaa dene se pehle pati patni ke bich sulah ke liye lanbaa vakt dete hai
 The cinematic image in the public on the triple talaq is derived from the film in which Deepak Parashar and Salma Aga acted
 jiskaa naam niqaah tha
 One should not say that three divorces do not exist
 vajood tha tabhi to kuch muslim auraten court main gayi lekin ise lekar jis tarah kaa raajnneetik shaamiyana taana gaya uske anupaat main yah samasya itani to badi nahin thi
 Nevertheless, one should welcome that only one got relief from the mess of three divorces at one time
 2011 kii janaganana ke mutabik maatr 0
 49 percent of Muslim women were locked up
 sankhya kitni choti he
 This 0
 49 pratishat talaak main sabhi teen talaaq vaali nahin thim
 There are many divorce methods in the Quran
 ek vidhi he khulaa jo auraton ko hasil he
 If you want a woman, you can buy a rejected man by buying Tata from your side
 koran ko padhenge to pataa chalegaa ki isamen devi kii kalpana nahin he
 Rather, the whole fantasy has been made for the husband to be a better husband
 patni se ummid nahin kii jaati he ki vah das logon kaa khaanaa banaaegi
 The husband is expected to help the wife in her work
 hakeekat main kitna hota he alag baat he, bharat main kisi bhi dharm ke mardon kii quality vaise hi bahut karaab he
 This is enough for women to marry them
 kai baar mujhe hairaani hoti he ki bharat kii ladkiyaan bhartiya ladakon se shaadi kaise kar leti hai
 But well jane dijie
 See the fathers in your homes
 99 fisadi gharon main meri baat sahi sabit hogi
 But you do not look
 bahut dukhi ho jaaenge
 i have written all these things after reading a book called till talaq do us part (understanding triple talaq and khula)
 zia-us-salaam ( ziya-us-salam) ne angrezi main kitaab likhi he
 Very mild English
 ise meri tarah karaab angrezi jaanane vaala bhi aaraam se pard saktaa he or samaj saktaa he
 You must read this book
 teen talaaq par bahes to hogi
 i can't stop that
 news channelon ko theme or theory vaale taapic chahie taaki us par bahes kar ve apane khaali spes ko bhar saken
 Just reading and gathering information will not enrich that debate
 raajnneetik agenda puraa karegaa
 Penguin has published this book and the price is also very low
 399 rupee
 Read and then debate in favor and opposition
 jo likhaa he wo hindi main likhaa he, coment karne se pehle puure lekh ko thik se pard len or kitaab bhi padhein
 However, for those who connect religion with science, a line has been written in the Supreme Court judgment of August 2017
 mujhe hairaani hui ki kisi bhi dharm ke logon ne hallaa nahin kiya
 Religion is a matter of faith, not of logic
 angrezi main isi baat ko pard sakate hai
 So, please read
 bahes kiijie magar thodaa shram karne ke baad
 ‚Äúthe practice (triple talaq) being a component of 'personal law' has the protection of Article 25 of the constitution
 Religion is a matter of faith and not of logic
 It is not open to a court to accept an egalitarian approach over a practice which constitutes an integral part of religion

 Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has ended his sit-in at the LG office
 9 dinon tak alji daftar main dharna dene ke baad kejariwal kii tabiyat bighad gai
 He will go to Bangalore for treatment
 kejariwal 10 din tak bengalooru main rahenge
 Meanwhile, Leader of Opposition in the Delhi Assembly Vijendra Gupta said that the strategy behind ending Kejriwal's sit-in has now come to the fore
 or isi chuttee par jane ke liye kejariwal ne mangalvaar ko dharna khatm kiya tha
 Gupta alleged that it was necessary to get up on Tuesday from the dharna to go on leave and Kejriwal did the same
 gupta ne kejariwal kii chuttee ko dilli kii janata ke saath vishwasghaat bataaya he
 Gupta said that there would be no contact with Kejriwal during the first 9 days of dharna and then after 10 days of leave, which means that Kejriwal is leaving Delhi thirsty in the scorching heat and moving to Bengaluru
 vijendra guptane kaha ki 9 dinon ke dharne ke baad dilli vaale soch rahe the ki ab mukhyamantri dharne pradarshan ke baad unki samasyaon ko sulajhane kii koshish karenge, lekin siem ulta chuttee par ja rahe hai
 Gupta said that the CM did not do any work during the 9-day sit-in and when the turn came to work, he is going on leave which shows Kejriwal's irresponsible attitude
 vijendra gupta ne aarope lagaaya ki siem kejariwal pichley saadhe chaar maheene ke dauraan farvari main sirf ek din, march main 9 din, may main 5 din ke alaava april or june main ek bhi din siem daftar nahin gaye
 That is, Kejriwal has gone to office only for 15 days in four and a half months
 gupta ne kejariwal par kataaksh karte hue kaha ki mukhyamantri pad par asin rahete itane kam samay ke liye daftar jane par unka naam limca book of records main darj hona chahie
 The BJP leader alleged that Kejriwal is also absent from the Delhi Assembly and he did not come to the Assembly for 3 days in the session that ended last

 Because our sources have told that those people are alive

 We have no direct contact with them

 BSP supremo Mayawati termed the dismissal of two ministers of Akhilesh government as "drabbaji" and said that the move of Akhilesh government before the elections is not going to benefit the people of the state
 kyonki puri sarkaar hi bhrashtachar main dubi hui he
 He said that the people of the state are not going to come under the influence of this step of Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav
 mayawati ne kaha- upi main jangalrajmayawatine kaha ki pradesh main kanoon vyavastha kii sthiti bahut kharaab he
 There is an atmosphere of chaos and jungle raj in the state

 Because the election is on the head and the Akhilesh government has been indulging in corruption in these four and a half years
 isi vajah se aam janata ko bevakoof banane kii niyat se aisi dikhaawati karrwai kii gai he
 Pending investigation against corrupt minister of SP government, BSP leader said that cases of investigation against many ministers are still pending

 Mayawati said that this government has given all kinds of protection to the non-minister and leaders, hardly any government would have given it
 yahi vajah he ki sapa sarkaar gambhir bhrashtachar ke maamle tak main sibiai jaanch rukvane ke liye har prakaar kii tikadambaaji lagaataar karti rahi he
 The BSP government took action on the corrupt people over the phone
 Maiyawati has claimed that unlike the Samajwadi Party government, in some cases during the BSC government, as soon as there were complaints of disturbances, then the investigation of the case was handed over to the CBI by taking the same action
 
 saath hi sambandhit mantri ko barkhaast kar diya gaya tha
 Whereas in the matter of dealing with corruption effectively, the attitude of the SP government of the state has been pathetic and conniving with the corrupt and giving protection to them
 jaisaa centre main congress party ke shasankaal main pehle hota rahaa he
 The Congress government also attacked the Modi government, while attacking Mayawati also said that all this is happening in the BJP government under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the Center
 jo lalit modi cond, vyapam ghotaalaa or vijay maalya cond se sabit hota he
 In this case, no strict action was taken by the government

 "according to Kaul, after the incident with DSP Pandit, the movement of Kashmir has taken place against the stonemasons
 aapako bataa den ki iske pehle shaheedon ke parivaar ne bhi aatankiyon orpattharabaajon ke khilaaf aawajuthai thi
 Kaul continued, "there is a lot of difference from before
 jab yahaan id hoti he namaaj adaa karne ke liye kaaphi badi sankhya main log aate hai
 This time he was very few
 is baar jo patharbaji subah hui uski intencity pehle saalon se thodi kam thi
 This is the reason for his lynching incident with DSP Ayub Pandit
 hamaare DSP shahid hue hai to jo sthaneey log hai unke dwaara isaki badi ninda kii ja rahi he
 "kaul said," was a very unfortunate incident
 ham bhi isaki ninda karte hai
 The biggest thing is that even among the local people, there is a great resentment about it
 is bare main mujhe lagata he jarur fark aayega (patharbaajon or aatankiyon ko milane vaale saport)
 People understand that now even the local people are not being spared
 saare log ek jaise nahin hai
 There are some non-social elements
 or jo local awam he unki samaj main ye aane laga he
 " desh, duniya, mahanagar, khel, aarthik or bollywood main kya kuch hua

 Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Yadav is leaving no stone unturned to memorialize RJD President Lalu Prasad's birthday on June 11
 path nirmaan mantri hone ke naate tejasvi ne bihar kii ganga nadi par bane do ahm pul kaa locarpan janmdin ke avasar par karne ja rahe hai
 In addition to inaugurating the path of JP Setu connecting Patna to Sonepur, he will dedicate to the public the newly constructed high-level extradosal bridge connecting Ara and Chhapra
 is pul kaa naam vir kunwar singh sethu hoga
 a one-page advertisement has been published in the newspapers of Patna, in which it is said that Chief Minister Nitish Kumar will inaugurate these bridges
 kaarykram main bhootpurv mukhyamantri or tejasvi yadav ke pitalalu prasad yadavaur bihar congress ke pradesh adhyaksh or shikshaamantri ashok choudhary bhi upasthiti rahenge
 Tejashwi Yadav will preside over the program
 halaki yah kaarykram patna ke samvaad se hi sanchalit hoga
 The people of Bihar will benefit greatly from the simultaneous locking of both the bridges
 iske saath hi jarjar ho chuke gandhi sethu par dabaav kam hoga
 The distance between r and Chhapra will be reduced by half
 patna ke logon ke ganga paar karne ke liye gandhi sethu ke alaava ek or vikalp jepi sethu mil jayega
 Although despite the bjp's opposition, Tejaswi Yadav has scheduled the release schedule of these bridges on his father Laloo Prasad Yadav's birthday, but the bjp's opposition to it certainly has not been officially announced
 bihar sarkaar ne bada elaan kiya he
 The government has announced the Chief Minister Old Age Pension Scheme for all those 60 years or older
 is yojana ke tahat 60 saal yaa usase zyada umr ke logon ko sarkaar pension dengi
 This scheme of the government will not be able to benefit those people who have retired from government jobs
 sarkaar kaa kahana he ki bihar main bahut se aise naagarik hai jinaki aarthik vyavastha acchhee nahin he
 He is not able to work at this stage of age
 rosemara ke kharche chalaane ke liye bhi unhen ashrith rahanaa padataa he
 In such a situation, the scheme has been started with the intention of providing financial help to the elderly citizens
 mukhyamantri nitish kumaar kaha kahana he ab tak kai pension yojanaon se vanchit rajya ke vriddhjanon ko anya pension yojana kii tarah is yojana ke tahat 400 rupaye masik pension milegi
 He said that to take advantage of this scheme, registration and linking of bank accounts with Aadhaar would start from March next month and it would be completed by July
 bataa den ki bihar kii vriddhapension yojana ke alaawarashtriya vriddhavastha pension yojana bhi chalaai jaati he
 Which started in 1995
 vriddhavastha pension yojana kaa kriyanvayan centre or rajya, donon sarkaron dwaara milakar kiya jaataa he
 In this, the amount received by the senior citizens benefiting from it is some part of the center and some of the state
 jisaki vajah se desh alag-alag rajyon main vahaan vriddhavastha pension yojana kii rakam alag alag hoti he
 In states like Delhi, Haryana and Andhra Pradesh, where senior citizens receive more than Rs 1000 a month as old-age pension, 550 in Himachal, 500 in Rajasthan, 400 in Maharashtra and 300 in UP are paid

 In # metoo campaign in Bollywood, many actors are making revelations about the excesses that happened to them
 actorsaf ali khaanne is campan kaa saport kiya he
 Not only this, he has revealed the harassment 25 years ago with him
 haalanki unka ye herracement sexuali nahin tha
 He said, "in my career, i have also faced harassment, but not successfully
" mujhe 25 saal pehle herrece kiya gaya tha
 Thinking about it, i still get angry today
 bahut se log dusron ko samajhate nahin hai
 It is very difficult to understand the suffering of others
 main iske bare main baat nahin karnaa chahta hum kyonki aaj ye jaruri nahin he
 Today we need to take care of women
 ''saf kaa kahana he ki aropiyon ko sajaa milani chahie, tab bhi agar ve kisi puraane maamle main doshi paae jaaen
 Saif, "people are humiliated and await justice
" jo bhi ho rahaa he wo sahi nahin he
 Those who have sexually harassed women will have to pay it
 ''sajid par lage aaropon par saf ne kya kaha?saf nessajid khanper lage gambhir aaropon par bhi pratikriya di he
 Let me tell you, Saif worked in Sajid's film Humshakals
 movie kii lead actress bipash basu or isha gupta ne sajid khan ke galat vyavhaar par bayaan diya he
 Saif said, "I really did not know that anything like this has happened
" agar mere saamne aisa hota to main us maahaul main kaam nahin kar paata
 Do not let all these things happen in front of you
 jahaan mahilaon kaa apmaan ho aisa maahaul mujhe katai sweekaar nahin he
 '' aktubar, 2007 main jab 24 sadasyeey fifa kaaryakarini ne sarvasammati se 2014 vishwa cap kii mejabani brazil ko saunpi to har ore jashn or khushi kaa maahaul tha
 As if this glorious game was returning to its original land, after all, it is called the Mecca of Football, from this land, the world has got to see the best football players, great fans and of course great football
 fifa vishwa cap us desh main laut rahaa tha jahaan 20veen shatabdi ke prarambh main rais auraten footbal stadium isliye jaaya karti thim, taaki ve apane liye shuhar chun saken
 Football has a unique and unmatched connection to Brazil as a symbol of domination on the world stage, from couples meeting
 phir bhi kuch samasyaayein aisi hai, jo vaaki gambhir hai
 On May 27, Brazilian players were leaving the hotel to go to a pre-tournament training camp near sao-palo after protesters started pelting stones on their bus and stopping
 brazil is aayojan par 11
 5 billion dollars, which is more than three times the amount spent on the 2010 FIFA Cup event in South Africa
 vah bhi aisi sthiti main jab brazil main swasthya or shiksha kii haalat behad khasta he
 This is the reason why a large section of society in Brazil is describing this event as a white elephant and is openly opposing it
 yahi nahin, stadimon ke nirmaan main deree, nirmaan kaary main lage mazdooron kii maut, aasmaan chooti laagat or kai stadimon main mobile connactivity kii samasya ne fifa ke sachiv jerome valk ko yah kehane par majaboor kar diya ki ''ham nahin chaahate ki brazil ko ab tak ke sabase kharaab vishwacap aayojan ke liye yaad kiya jaae kyonki patrkaar tak apni khabaren baaki duniya tak nahin pahunchaa paa rahe hai
 "in such a situation, the question has become present whether Brazil will be able to successfully carry out this event?" Will it be remembered as glorious in history or be told? What will be the impact on big sporting events in the world? Will developing countries continue to take responsibility for organizing such billions of dollars in future? And finally, what will be its lessons for football in general and for the Brazilian team in particular? a country that has given great players like Pel√©, Garicha, Carlos Alberto, Socrates, Jaico, Babetto, Ronaldinho, Romario, Ronaldo and now Neymar It has never been difficult for him to play great football
 brazil kii team hameshaa hi duniya main sabase pasandida rahi he
 This country has also played outstanding football
 pele kii gajab kii jaaduugari, gend par kamaal kaa niyantran or gol karne kii laajawab kshamta, garichaa kii bijli-si daud, joico kii bemisaal free-kik, brazil ke khiladinnon ne vishwa footbal ko kya kuch nahin diya he
 By winning five World Cups and countless championships, the Brazilian team has made football the first Brazilian identity in the world
 phir bhi, is baar brazil ab tak kii sabase kadi pariksha se rou-ba-rou he
 Like this, this time the competition is between passion and reality
 kya footbal kaa junun garibi or khastahali kii jamini sachai ko haraa saktaa he? kya brazil ke log is mahaaayojan ko gale laga lenge or yah bhula denge ki maheene bhar baad unke kandhon par sirf tex kaa baari boj bachegaa? or brazil kii team kii safalataa yaa vifaltaa kis had tak vishwacap kii lambii viraasat ko prabhavit karegi?tikhaa virohjankaar maanate hai ki agar vishwacap ko safal hona he to brazil ko jeetna hoga
 With every victory of Brazil from the initial stages, the protest will slow down and people will forget everything and get into the game
 samba apane shabaab par hoga, striker nemaar, dephender thiyago silva or coach lui philip scolari surkhiyaan batorne lagenge or media bhi aayojan kii vaahvahee main kho jayega
 But, if Brazil lost in the Round of 16 or earlier, the World Cup could turn into a scene of massive waste
 virodh bekaabu ho saktaa he or footbal se zyada dilchaspee duusari surkhiyon main bad sakati he
 The situation may look similar to that seen in India after the team's defeat in the first round at the Cricket World Cup in the West Indies in 2007
 to, hairaan na hoiega, agar khiladinnon ke gharon par hamale hone lagen or aayojakon ko nishaanaa banaaya janaa lage
 In the face of such apprehensions, Germany is sending its own security experts along with its team and has also built a special resort for players in Santo Andre, 435 miles south of the capital of Bahia, Salvador
 nirantar 'tarakkee karte shaharon' ke liye fifa world cap yaa olympic khelon kii mejabani apni jabardast marketing karne kaa jariya ban jaati he
 Its leaders make a strong claim to 'join the thriving urban population of the world' through it
 isamen koi shaq nahin ki yah sara tamaasha vilakshan khel pratibha, rashtriya dabadabe, vishaal aayojan kshamta or shaayad sabase mahatvapurn duniya main sampann-vipann ke bich kii khai kii numaaish kaa avasar hota he
 Actually, it is an established fact that big sporting events are a means of bringing boom in urbanization
 isi vajah se shaharon ke punerjeevan ke liye anivaary bade aayojanon kii mejabani pratishtha kaa prashn bana lee jaati he
 Its two examples are the 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Games, in which 21
 5 karod pound kaa munafa hua or 1992 kaa barceylona games, jisase shaharikaran main nai jaan aa gai thi
 But there have also been many failures in these events
 1976 main maantrial olympic or haal ke daur main 2010 main dilli main naakaami saaf-saaf dekhi gai
 69 in Montreal Games
 2 karod pound ke ghate kaa hawala dekar to toronto ke logon ne 1996 main olympic ke aayojan kaa virodh kiya or naare lagaae ''sarkas nahin, roti chahie
 "this rejected Montreal's claim of an Olympic event
" brazil main padhe-likhe logon ne sawaal uthaae hai ki hamaare adhiktar shaharon main thik se buniyadi dhaancha bhi nahin he to itane bade khel aayojan kii mejabani kii kya tuk he
 There is a crisis of housing and drinking water for the common people and high mortality is a huge problem, the drug trap is increasing and crime is at the peak
 iske saath hi pradarshnkaree sarkaar ke is daawey par bhi sawaal uthaa rahe hai ki vishwacap ke dauraan paryaton se desh ko 30 karod dollar kii kamai hogi or is toornament se aam brazilavasi par tex kaa boj bahut zyada nahin badhegaa
 Beautiful sports is not enough The second aspect of this debate is that similar fears are raised before every big sporting event
 yahaan tak ki beijing olympic ke dauraan bhi aise sawaal ubhare the
 Many people had even predicted that the FIFA World Cup in South Africa in 2010 would be a disappointment, but that country met this challenge
 isi tarah tamaam aalochanaon ke baavjood dilli main bhi rashtramandal khelon kaa aayojan thik-thaak kar liya gaya
 The Beijing and London Olympic events have defied all estimates
 landan ne to yah daawa bhi thok diya he ki 2012 kaa olympic ab tak kaa sabase shandaar rahaa he
 All these examples prove the same thing that the host countries do not take any pleasure in performing well
 2012 olympic main britain ne 29 swarnapadak jitkar itihaas bana diya tha
 In the 2010 Commonwealth Games, India also did wonders by winning 101 medals
 to, kya brazil scolari ke netritv main aisa hi kamaal dikhaa paaegaa yaa argentina super pratibha sampann leonnelle mesi kii aguai main khitaab apane naam kar legaa? kya lui sorej chot se chamatkaari dhang se ubar kar urugue ko 1950 main marakana jaisi shaan waapas dilaa paaegaa?footbal panditon kii maane to europe kii ek badi team brazil main khitaab jeet sakati he, chaahe vah philip laam kii germany ho yaa andres iniesta kii spain yaa eden hajard kii belgium
 The 2014 match is the most open in World Cup history
 yahaan tak christiano ronaldo kii portugal or vine runi kii england sahit koi 7 yaa 8 timen khitaab kii kaabiliyat rakhti hai
 But any team's victory in them will not bring a smile on the face of Sepp Blatter or Jirom Valk
 fifa or brazil sarkaar kii to yahi chahat he ki mejabaan team kuch or chust ho or record chhathi baar trophy jeet jaae
 After the final in the film Paradise Lost on the defeat of Brazil in 1950, there is a feeling of terrible disappointment
 aisa laga maano puraa desh kai dinon tak shok manaata rahaa
 At the packed Maracana Stadium, everyone wondered how Brazil's defeat to neighboring country Uruguay went 2-1
 phir bhi 1950 main brazil sirf ek footbal match haara tha
 The defeat was disappointing, but Brazil's economy did not suffer losses for a long time, but players were considered heroes a few days later, whose steps were the last hurdles
 is baar aisi koi ummid nahin he
 With two years left in the 2016 Rio Olympic Games and the experience of the World Cup is not good, Brazil may have to lose its way from hosting the Olympics
 atakalein lagane lagi hai ki landan ko taiyaar kiya ja rahaa he
 After a few days, the world's eyes will be on Brazil, then the question will not be just about Joga Bonito or the beautiful game
 sawaal gol daagne yaa bachaane kaa bhi nahin rah jayega
 Everything is at stake for the people of Brazil
 sawaal hakeekat se takaraakar junun kii haar, kadavi aarthik hakikaton se footbal ke upar na uth paane or bade khel aayojanon kii mejabani main vikasshil deshon kii naakaami kaa he

 For a long time there have been various speculations about Priyanka Gandhi campaigning
 kabhi khabaren aati he ki vah puure uttar pradesh main chunaav campan karengi, kabhi yah kahaan jaataa rahaa he ki vah sirf raibareli-amethi main hi prachaar karengi
 Amidst all these speculations, Uttar Pradesh Congress President Raj Babbar made it clear on Friday that Priyanka Gandhi had been requested to give maximum time in Uttar Pradesh elections and she is also very positive about it
 aisi ummid kii ja rahi he ki vah raibareli-amethi se baahar nikal kar chunaav prachaar karengi
 Posters of Priyanka Gandhi were also put up when Rahul Gandhi was traveling in Uttar Pradesh
 usase pehle yah tay kiya gaya tha ki priyanka gandhi kaa koi bhi poster akele nahin lagaaya jayega or doosraa unki photo rahul gandhi ke photo se choti lagegi taaki rahul ke kad ko kahin chota karke naa dekha jaae
 Raj Babbar says that Priyanka Gandhi's arrival will benefit a lot
 unhone saaf kiya ki abhi chunaav ko lekarranneetiban rahi he
 The Congress campaign will be planned with time and strategy
 uttar pradesh chunaav kii ranneeti ko lekar shuukravaar subah rahul gandhi ke ghar par uttar pradesh se jude tamaam bade netaaon kii baithak hui
 Which included Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi, Ghulam Nabi Azad, Raj Babbar, Sheela Dixit and Sanjay Singh
 is baithak main ek baar phir ye prastaav aayaa ki priyanka gandhi ko raibareli-amethi se baahar nikal kar campan karnaa chahie
 It is being told that in this meeting Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi agreed that she could give more time in Uttar Pradesh and campaign out of Rae Bareli and Amethi
 loksabhaa chunaav ho yavidhansabha chunaavapriyanka gandhi ne khud ko raibareli-amethi tak hi khud ko simit rakhaa rahaa he
 He never campaigned outside these two parliamentary constituencies
 haalanki congress netaa aksar maang karte rahe hai ki unako pradesh bhar main chunaav prachaar karnaa chahie
 The reason for this has been clear that the Congress has been seeing the image of Indira Gandhi in Priyanka Gandhi
 unka maananaa he ki priyanka gandhi, indira gandhi kii tarah dikhti hai
 She speaks like him
 jiskaa phayda party ko mil saktaa he
 In view of the increasing demand of Priyanka Gandhi by Congress leaders and workers in every election, this time there is a consensus in the Gandhi family that Priyanka Gandhi should also be seen in a big role in the election
 yahi vajah rahi ki rahul gandhi ke ghar hui meeting main tamaam netaaon kii maang par rahul or priyanka positive dikhaai die

 iske baad gahare rang kaa chashma pahane ek shaks court number teen main daakhil hua
 The District Commissioner of Police (DCP) present there asked the person who he was
 His answer to this question was, 'you will ask who i am?' After that he left

 Kanhaiya told that the person with glasses had beaten him

 When Vrinda asked the police to take action in the case, he also did nothing
 unhone bataaya ki iske baad bhi ajeebogareeb ghatnaon kaa silsilaa jari rahaa
 The doctor, who was summoned by the police for medical tests, refused to take Kanhaiya's statement that he was beaten inside the court
 usne keval jaj ke nirdesh kaa hi paalan kiya
 According to Vrinda, there was a change in the attitude of the police even after Supreme Supervisors came, otherwise it could have happened
 isse pehle, dilli police ke pramukh bies bassi ne NDTV ko ek intervyuu main bataaya ki police kanhaiya kumaar ko court tak surakshit lekar gai thi

 He said that even after this, a series of strange incidents continued
 police kii ore se jis doctor ko medical test ke liye bulaayaa gaya, usne kanhaiya kaa yah bayaan lene se manaa kar diya ki use court ke andar peeta gaya
 He only followed the instruction of the judge
 vrinda ke mutabik, supreme ke paryvekshakon ke aane ke baad bhi police ke ravaiye main badlaav aayaa, varanaa kuch bhi ho saktaa tha
 Earlier, Delhi Police chief BS Bassi told NDTV in an interview that the police had taken Kanhaiya Kumar safely to court
 maharashtra ke thane jile main ek maasoom kii hatya kaa sansanikhej maamla saamne aayaa he
 The reason for the murder is such that, knowing that your ruins are trembling, because the piece of someone's heart was murdered here only because that mother was heartbroken, her lover was innocently trying to make love
 police ke mutabik, thane ke mumbra ilaake menma ke aashiq nekthith rup se chaar saal ke ek bachche ko jamkar peeta jiske kaaran uski maut ho gai
 Police Inspector DM Patil said the 27-year-old mother of the child had divorced from her husband three years ago and was living in Kausa area of mumbra with her three children
 uske do betiyaan or ek betaa tha
 He said that the accused Amir Saeed alias Billa has criminal records and had made him close to the child's mother three months earlier
 vah aksar unke ghar aata tha
 According to the complaint lodged by the woman, the accused believed that the three children were a hindrance to her and he often beat her
 bachaane ai beti to use bhi peetath june ko is bachche ne subah ke naashte ke baad ulti karnaa shuru kar diya
 Angered Saeed beat the child so much that he fainted
 bachche kii ek bahan jab use bachaane gai to usneldki ko bhi jamkar pitajiske chalate uske haath main fracture ho gaya
 The accused then threatened the family members that if he told anyone about the incident, he would kill them all

 Patil said that the child died in Sian Hospital in the early hours of yesterday

 The court said that Salman will have to pay a bond of Rs 25,000
 maamle kii sunwayeekarte hue justise eaar joshi ne kaha ki maamle kii sunwaayee galat tareeke se kii gai he
 He also said that the case hearing in the sessions court was defiant and the prosecution failed to properly prove the charges
 iske pehle buudhvaar ko court ne maamle kii sunwaayee ke dauraan kaha tha ki consteble rabindra patil ke bayaan par bharosa nahin kiya ja saktaa
 The court had ordered Salman Khan to be present in the court while delivering the verdict, following which Salman Khan left the house for production at around one and a half
 court ne salmaan kii maujuudagi main hi faisla sunaaya
 Patil's statement was found to be wrong in the investigation

 justise ne kaha ki visangatiyaan or gaayab mahatvapurn jaivik saboot ke chalate andeh paidaa hota he
 He said it was surprising that the speed of the car was so fast that it took him 30 minutes to reach the spot from JW Marriott
 iskaa matlab he ki car kii speed ko lekar diya gaya rabindra kaa bayaan sahi nahin he
 Because there were speed breakers along the way
 rabindra patil kii maut ho chuki he
 'no evidence found of Salman Khan being drunk' Haikourt said during the hearing that no evidence has been found that Salman Khan was driving at the time of the accident
 naa hi yah aarope ab tak sabit ho paaya he ki haadase vakt salmaan khan nashe main the
 After the accident, Salman was sent to the Government Bhabha Hospital in Bandra

 After this announcement by Congress President Rahul Gandhi, there is a situation of turmoil in the politics of Kerala
 kerala se rahul gandhi ke dangal main utarane ke elaan ke baad left ne bhi aawaaj mukhar kar di he
 Former CPM general secretary and current politburo member Prakash Karat told 'aaj Tak' that Rahul Gandhi's election from Wayanad shows directly that the Congress is going to challenge the LDF in Kerala
 kya bole karaat?prakaash karaat ne kaha ki congress baar-baar yah kahati he ki vah bijepi se lard rahi he, lekin bijepi kaa kerala main koi astitv hi nahin to aise main aaj kaa congress kaa yah kadam us bayaan ke khilaaf he
 Karat further said that Rahul Gandhi is coming directly to challenge the Left in Kerala
 aise main ham bijepi or congress donon se dat kar muqabla karenge
 Not only Kerala CM Raiders Politburo member Prakash Karat, Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said that Rahul Gandhi is fighting against Wayanad Lok Sabha seat not against BJP but against Left, so we have vowed to defeat him
 bataa den ki congress ke varisht netaa e
 K
 antni kii rahul ke vynad se ladane kii ghoshnaa ke kuch hi ghanton ke baad kerala ke siem ne rahul par hamalaa bolaa he
 In the press conference, CM Vijayan said that Rahul Gandhi could also contest from any seat where BJP is his direct rival, but it is clear from Rahul's decision to fight Wayanad that he came to fight the Left, not the BJP
 Huh
 seetaram yechuri bhi mukharasipiem ke mahasachiv seetaram yechuri ne kaha ki rahul gandhi sidhe taur par vynad se ldf ke khilaaf chunaav ladanaa chaahate hai
 What the message goes from this, is for the Congress to decide
 yechuri ne kaha ki koi bhi party yah tay kar sakati he ki vah kis ummidavaar ko kahaan se chunavaa ladaana chaahati he, lekin kya sandesh dena chaahati he, iske liye janata ko bataanaa hoga
 Explain that while announcing Rahul Gandhi's candidature from Wayanad, the Congress says that this Lok Sabha seat is the center of three states of South India
 karnataka, kerala or tamilnadu se congress kii rajya ikai dwaara lagaataar maang uthne ke baad congress netritv ne yah faisla liya he, jisko rahul gandhi ne manjuuri di he
 Congress leader AK Antony announced that Rahul Gandhi's fight against Wayanad is good news for Congress units in South India and South India
 vahiin congress pravaktaa randeep surajevaala ne kaha ki rahul gandhi vynad se lard kar vahaan kii janata ko sandesh dena chaahate hai ki congress dakshin bharat kii parampara kaa sammaan karti he or uske khilaaf khadi bijepi ko haraane ke liye taiyaar he
 It is worth noting that recently there was a discussion between the CPM and the Congress on an alliance in Bengal, while there is also an exercise in opposition parties across the country to form a grand alliance against the bjp-led NDA
