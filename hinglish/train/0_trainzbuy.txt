 dilli se saansad or bhojpuri superstar manoj tiwari ko dilli bijepi kaa nayaa adhyaksh banaaya he manoj tiwari satish upaadhyaay kii jagah lenge

 dilli bijepi netaa pawan sharma bhi adhyaksh pad ke daud main bhi shaamil the, lekin antat manoj tiwari ko chunaa gaya
 In fact, after the formation of the Aam Aadmi Party government, the Chief Minister of Delhi, Arvind Kejriwalalgaatar was proving to be a failure of the Delhi BJP to stop the way the central government is targeting, in such a situation, the BJP was looking for a leader who is known in the public
 jiske baad manoj tiwari kaa naam uchhla lekin sankat is baat ko lekar tha ki manoj tiwari bijepi main nae he aise main sanghathan kii jimmedaari kaise di ja sakati he
 There was a lot of confusion in the BJP about this, but in the end there was no other famous face except Manoj Tiwari to counter AAP and can also pull the Purvanchali voters with him
 manoj tiwari ke saamne sabase badi chunauti 2017 ke shuruaati maheene main hi emsidi chunaav main bijepi ko jeet dilaanaa he
 Harshvardhan, Vijay Goel Within three hours of the announcement, Manoj Tiwari also took over the chair of the President, during this time the party took care that there was solidarity in the party, so during the coronation of Manoj Tiwari, Minister Harshvardhan, Vijay Goel All the mps were kept present
 manoj tiwari kii niyukti ko dilli main purvaanchali votaron ko lubhaane ke liye uthaaya kadam mana ja rahaa he, kyonki dilli main upi or bihar se taalluk rakhane vaale purvaanchali logon kii acchhee khaasi taadaad he, jo chunaavon main nirnaayak bhoomika nibhaate hai
 It is believed that Dr
 Harshvardhan and Vijay Goel from Vaishya Samaj have already been made ministers in the Central Government, in such a situation, BJP has tried to help Purvanchali society by appointing Tiwari

 unhone kaha ki wo naram swabhaav ke hai, lekin dilli waalon kii ladaai puri garmjoshi se ladenge
 Although this sudden change also showed some restlessness among the leaders of Delhi BJP, the discussion is also that the celebrity face has definitely held the post of president, but in terms of organization, Tiwari's experience is very less
 saath hi party ke saath bhi unka naata zyada purana nahin he
 At the beginning of his speech, MP Pravesh Verma said that his meeting with Manoj Tiwari is three years old, the same will be a big challenge for Manoj Tiwari, because the MCD elections are only three months old

 yah puche jane par ki agar prashanth kishor ko sanghathan sambandhi maamalon par party ne koi adhikaar nahin diya he to phir vah kis haisiyat se uttar pradesh ke liye rahul gandhi ke chehre ko aage karne jaisi baaten kar rahe hai
 Shakeel Ahmed says that this is all media speculation
 rahul gandhi ke liye hamane badi-badi chizein soch rakhi hai
 Shakeel Ahmad emphasized that the way the campaign has changed in the changed situation, and that's why Prashant Kishore's help is being sought, nothing more
 gyaat ho ki pichley dinon khabar ai thi ki kuch patrakaron ke saath mulaakaat ke dauraan prashanth kishor ne upi ke liye rahul gandhi kaa cheharaa tak aage karne kii sambhaavna kaa izhaar kiya tha
 All the senior leaders of the Congress party have so far avoided officially refuting it directly
 khud rahul gandhi se jab NDTV ne is babat sawaal kiya tha to unhone bhi khandan karne kii jagah yah kahkar baat ko taal diya tha ki aap media vaale hi naam chalaate ho, aap log hi jaano
 It may be known that during the meeting with some journalists, Prashant Kishore had expressed the possibility of bringing forward Rahul Gandhi's face for UP
 congress party ke tamaam varisht netaa ab tak aadhikarik rup se is baat kaa sidhe taur par khandan karne se bachate nazar aa rahe hai
 When NDTV was asked about this by Rahul Gandhi himself, he too deferred the matter by saying instead of denying that you run the name of the media, you people only know

 dilli ke purv mukhya sachiv anshu prakaash se marpet ke maamle main unhen alagase vakil die jane ke patiala house court ke aadesh ko dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal or is maamle se jude kuch or aropiyon ne dilli hai court main chunauti di he
 While holding the first hearing on the matter today, the Delhi High Court has issued a notice to former Chief Secretary Anshu Prakash
 anshu prakaash ko 17 disambar ko hone vaali sunwaayee se pehle jawaab daakhil karnaa hoga
 The Patiala House Court verdict of Special Counsel given to former Chief Secretary Anshu Prakash has been challenged in the Delhi High Court by Kejriwal and Manish Sisodia on the ground that the government appointed government lawyer can advocate for the rest, including the Chief Minister
 If the same lawyer will plead in the court of Anshu Prakash, what can be his objection? unhen alag vakil kii kya aavashyaktaa he
 The Patiala House Court allowed the Chief Secretary to cross-examine Special Counsel Siddharth Aggarwal and v Madhukar on behalf of the former Chief Secretary
 court ne dilli police kamishnar ko nirdesh diya tha ki wo kisi atirikt ayukta str ke adhikari kii niyukti bataur abhiyojak ke karen
 The order of the House Court was done according to the rules
 siarpisi main yah niyam he ki agar koi apane liye nijee vakil rakhana chahta he to usko isaki ijaajat special cese main mil sakati he
 But it is clear that there were always big differences between former Chief Secretary Anshu Prakash and the Delhi government
 aise main alag vakil kii maang anshu prakaash kii taraf se isiilie kii gai kyonki unhen aisa laga ki sarkaar dwaara niyukt vakil court main unke paksh ko utana behatar tareeke se nahinrakh paaenge jitna behatar tareeke se ek nijee vakil rakh saktaa he
 Anshu Prakash argued that the Delhi government is under pressure from government lawyers, so they cannot object to their case impartially
 aam aadmi party in dinon piem narendra modi kii bajaae congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi par sawaalon kii bauchhaar karne main vyast he

 'aap' netaaon kii hairaani kii ek vajah haal hi main hue emsidi ke upachunaav main congress voters kii badhat bhi ho sakati he
 Even before Rahul Gandhi reached Ramlila Maidan to campaign for Rahul Gandhi's MCD election on Tuesday, AAP leaders sought 5 answers from the Congress by asking 5 questions
 'paryatak kii tarah dilli aae hai rahul'aam aadmi partike netaa dilip pandeya ne aarope lagaate hue kaha, 'dilli main 15 saal sarkaar main rahane or pichley 20 saal se nagar nigam kii satta main rahane ke baavjood congress party dilli kii janata kii samasyaon ko dur nahin kar pai
 Even after a government in Delhi and at the Center, the people had reduced the Congress to zero in the assembly elections
 philhal rahul gandhi ek paryatak kii tarah phir se dilli padhaare hai or puure desh main congress kaa bantaadhaar karne ke baad duusari baar dilli main congress ko shunya kaa uphaar dete dikh rahe hai
 Five questions from Aam Aadmi Party's Rahul Gandhi
 rahul gandhidilli kii janata ko emsidi main rahete hue unki party kaa koi ek mahatvapurn kaam bataaen
 2
 chunaav se thik pehle 2008 main rahul gandhi kii party ne takreeban 1300-1400 coloniyon ke bashindon ko farji proviginal certificate baante the
 After this, 895 was notified and after that if 'no' everyone is on government land then it will be very difficult in their case because there are 312 colonies on profit land and will regularize them
 dilli kii janata jaananaa chaahati he ki farji certificate baantkar dilli kii janata ko murkh banane ke liye kya rahul gandhi apni party kii taraf maafee maagenge?3
 The councilors in the Municipal Corporation of Delhi belong to both the BJP and the Congress, and whatever situation the MCD has today, it is because of these two
 bijepi shasit emsidi jaanboojhkar safaikarmiyon kii selary nahin detii he or phir majaboor hokar safai karmchaaree hadtaal karte hai
 If the bjp-congress-funded unions spread the garbage in this cash-in-pain of the cleaning workers, then the people of Delhi are very upset
 congress ke yogadan se hui is kachare kii raajnneeti se dilli kii janata ko jo takalif hui he, kya rahul gandhi dilli kii janata se is pareshaani ke liye maafee maagenge?4
 Sheila Dixitlagar said that the power companies cannot be audited because there is a stay of the High Court
 ab aam aadmi party kii sarkaar banane ke baad hamane padtaal kiya to pataa chalaa ki aisa koi ste he hi nahin
 When we started the investigation, the power companies went to the High Court against it
 to rahul gandhi ko dilli kii janata ko bataanaa chahie ki unki party bijli companiyon ke hiton ko bachaana chaahati he yaa janata ke hiton ko surakshit rakhana chaahati he?5
 Rahul wants to ask Gandhi that his party has been in the state government for 15 years
 iske pehle emsidi ko bhi wo chalaa rahe the, to 15 saal ke congress shasankaal ke dauraan dilli main bijli ke daam kyon badhate rahe?

 rahul aaj somvaar ko yahaan manama main 50 deshon se bhartiya mul ke bijness leaderon se mulaakaat or bharat kii arthvyavastha va aarthik mandi par charchaa karenge
 Rahul's visit to Bahrain is not just a meeting with the NRI living in the Gulf countries, but also its political significance
 rahul ne jis prakaar apni america daure ke jariye gujarat kii siyaasi bisaat bichaai thi
 Rahul has reached Bahrain on the same lines, which is being seen as a Karnataka connection
 gauratlab he ki khadi deshon main badi sankhya main bhartiya rahete hai
 They have a significant number of people from southern India, mainly Kerala and Karnataka
 aise main rahul bahrain yatra ko 2019 ke loksabhaa or agle kuch maheenon main hone vaale karnataka ke vidhansabha chunaav ke maddenjar kaaphi mahatvapurn mana ja rahaa he
 There are close to 3
5 million Indians in the Gulf countries, who are particularly associated with South India
 aise main rahul ke is daure kaa raajnneetik mahatv bhi he, jiskaa asar karnataka chunaav par pad saktaa he

 bijepi dobaaraa se satta main vaapasi ke liye puri takat lagaae hue he to vahiin rahul ko satta barkaraar rakhane kii chunauti he
 Political motives of Rahul's visit to Bahrain are also being extracted

 rahul pravasi bharatiyon ke saath conect karenge or GOPIO ko sambodhit karte hue modi kii aarthik nitiyon par sawaal khadaa kar sakate hai, jis prakaar america main unhone sawaal uthaae the
 Rahul's visit to the Gulf countries can have a major impact on the politics of South India
 congress iskaa phayda karnataka ke chunaav main bhi uthaa sakati he
 That is why Congress leader Madhu Gaur from Rahul's visit to Bahrain is from South India

 Theft of the document The surveillance of the National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and the Intelligence Bureau on the investigation of the filegate shows how surprising the government is in the light of the leak of information

 unhone kaha, 'ioe ke kuch log meri chhavi kharaab karne or meraa apmaan karne ke liye abhiyaan chalaa rahe hai
 i will expose them but i do not want to fall to this level

 i have been in sports administration for a long time and there are allegations that i am desperate for this post, these too will be proved wrong
 ' unhone kaha, 'bharat main kai log hai jo aise pad hasil kar sakate hai or acha kaam bhi kar sakate hai
 Randhir also claimed that if he had contested the election, he would have the number of votes to win the election, but insisted that the atmosphere created and the level of personal charges forced him to withdraw the nomination

 Elections to be held on December 5 are mired in controversies that the government's Sports Code or Olympic Charter should be followed
 ioe ne saaf kar diya he ki agar chunaav sarkari dishanirdeshren (adhikariyon kii umr or kaarykaal simit karne) ke hisaab se kiye gayi to ioe ko nilambit kar diya jaayegaa
 The organization gave the IOA till November 30 to clarify its stand on the issue

 There is a lot of churn in the BJP organization on this suggestion

 In such a situation, he is not accepting this suggestion as practical
 agar is suzav par amal ho gaya to agle chunaav main nishchit rup se unka bhi patta saaf ho saktaa he
 However, the Sangh Parivar has also given the option that senior leaders of the party above 75 years of age cannot be completely excluded

 He will be taken to the Rajya Sabha

 Narlikar said in a letter to President Pranab Mukherjee that awards have special dignity and they should be kept above this protest
 unhone kaha ki sahitya academy ne kalburgi kii hatya par deree se pratikriya di
 At the same time, returning many award winners is a sign of their anger at the lack of emotion in the institute

" iske faillo or puraskaar vijetaon ko academy par swatantra soch ko dabaae jane ke maahaul kii kadi ninda ke liye dabaav bananaa chahie tha
 He said, however, it does not seem appropriate to return the Academy Awards in this way

 unhone kaha, haalanki is tarah se academy puraskaron ko lautaanaa uchit nahin lagata
 Awards have a special dignity that reflects their national character and should be kept above this protest

 youtube channel AIB has grown to 1 million subscribers in 18 months
 utyub or digital madhyamon par prasaarit hone vaali isaki gaali-galoch bhari kuch saamagree pichley kaaphi samay se charchaa main rahi he
 How true such programs are, how wrong they are
 lekin buniyadi sawaal to yahi he ki ye kaarykram banaaya hi kyon gaya
 Beginning with light comedy
 
 
 2 farvari 2013, kamedi group AIB ne apane utyub channel par pehla video aplod kiya
 The conversation was happening on the scene of films
 bich-bich main gaaliyaan bhi di ja rahi thim
 About eight lakh people have seen him so far
 bahut zyada nahin saraahaa gaya
 Many may have seen this after the group got into controversies
 gambhir muddon par jabardast creativity
 
 
 On September 19, 2013, a video was uploaded featuring Kalki Koechling, in which Kalki satirically stated how effectively it is nonsense to describe women's clothes, their mobile phone use as a rape
 us video ko ab tak 46 lakh se zyada log dekh chuke hai
 On 5 March 2014, the same group released a video titled Donation's Side Effect
 12 lakh se zyada log is video ke jariye is group ke jeniyas ko dekh chuke hai jinhone ek bachche ke gusse ko bade hi rochak dhang se filmaaya he, jo apane pita ko daant rahaa he ki vah eemaandaar bane rahakar kaise uskaa admician bade college main karvaa paaegaa
 Where will he bring the money from donation? 
 
 
 And the video uploaded on 15 August 2014 did wonders
 bharat-pakistan ke yuvaaon kii telephone par hui aapasi baatcheet kaa yah video 21 lakh se zyada logon ne dekha
 More than 29 thousand appreciated it
 in sabhi video ko logon ne khub dekha
 Strongly appreciated or share kiya
 Yes, they did not suddenly go viral
 or desh main inhen centre main rakhkar kahin charchaa nahin hui
 Because, there have been experiments on these subjects
 to kuch alag karne ke liye foohadataa hi kyon?aib roast kaa idia laayaa gaya
 Abuse - Galouch Even though the video of this program came into the world of web, there was chaos
 har tarah ke darshak, har tarah kii pratikriyaayein
 Youth, elderly, celebrity and government
 utyub or twitor par duniya main yah top trending tak pahunchaa
 But the videos mentioned above, viewers will be able to relate themselves to them whenever they see them
 bajaae hansaane ke naam par yojit kiye gaye gaali-galoch bhare kisi kaarykram ke
 Four youth have formed AIB
 gursimran khamba, tanmay bhatta, roshan joshi or ashish cychia kaa dimag he iske peeche
 Initially he used to podcast his program (digital Telecast)
 phir fund kii jarurat padi to utyub par aae
 To prove himself commercially successful, he chose a path which became controversial
 haa, kamai bhi hui
 Actually, the issue is not just about abusive programs
 sawaal in jeniyas yuvaaon kii pratibha kaa bhi he
 Those who do amazing creativity on topics like rape, india-pakistan and donation first
 lekin baad main unhenthaibhroast ke raste par aana padataa he
 Why? If there is a shortage in talent, it cannot happen
 haa, thodi mehnat lagati he
 But they did not want to avoid working hard
 to kya mahaj teji se lokapriyata paane or paisa kamaane ke liye ye sab kiya? kaaran inamen se jo bhi ho, yah tark khaarij ho jaataa he ki aise kaaryakramon ko manjuuri di jaani chahie
 Superstar Salman Khan danced to the superhit tune of 'baby Ko Bas Pasand Hai', so his film 'sultan' proved to be the Sultan of the box office
 kuch usee tarj par siyaasi ranneetikaar pike ne upi kii siyaasi jang main tipu yani akhilesh yadav ko ek baar phir 'upi kaa sultan' yani siem banane ke liye siyaasi naaraa gadha he
 But, PK strategists are Rahul Gandhi's, and Rahul Gandhi's Congress has an alliance with Akhilesh's Samajwadi Party
 isliye pike ne upi kii siyaasi dhun gadhate vaqt is baat kaa khaas khyaal rakhaa he
 According to sources, PK likes Baby as a base and has created a new slogan - "UP likes ya saath" in view of Salman's popularity, especially among the youth
 darasal, congress or sapa kaa gathjod ho chukaa he
 Along with congress-sp, priyanka-dimple and akhilesh-rahul have started appearing in posters, banners and slogans
 donon partiyon ke kaaryakartaaon ko ye khub raas bhi aa rahaa he
 In such a situation, this new slogan has been coined to take advantage of this in UP and to woo the youth
 isse pehle team pike ne 'apane ladke banaam bahari modi' kaa slogan uchhaala tha
 Efforts were made to take advantage of the bjp's not being the face of the BJP in UP in the Bihar election, on the lines of external versus Bihari, and PM Modi will not become CM, so Akhilesh's personality should be brightened on the lines of Nitish
 media reportras ke mutabik, khud akhilesh ne is naare par aitraaj jataayaa tha
 But according to sources from Team PK, these are all baseless things
 "apane ladke (rahul-akhilesh) banaam bahari modi " kabhi naaraa nahin tha, balki ye ek theme he
 There was no change in this nor did anyone object to Akhilesh or Congress
 sutron kii maane to 29 janvari ko is theme ke saath nae naare ko lakhanu main launch karne kii yojana he
 Sources are also claiming that on January 29, the schedule of Akhilesh and Rahul's joint press conference is also being prepared
 kul milakartim pike, jo congress ke shahzaade yani rahul ko 2019 main desh kasultanyani piem banane kii ranneeti ke tahat kaam kar rahi he
 Before that he will have to sit on the chair of "tipu Ko Sultan" i
e
 up's CM
 philhal ye siyasat he film nahin, yahaan ritek kaa mauka nahin miltaa
 However, till now PK has also been the director of politics, who has been giving only hits, whether it is Vomodifor PM or Modi, challenging Nitish for CM in Bihar
 to taiyaar ho jaaiye 11 march ke liye jab saamne hogi tasviir ki, tipu bane sultan yaa tipu hue flop
 Became PK once again champion Verna PK Back to Pavilion

 Shiv Sena has supported Sarsanghchalak Mohan Bhagwat's statement of Hindu Rashtra
 shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare ne apni party ke mukhpatr 'saamana' ke sampadakeey main likhaa ki mohan bhagwat kaa bayaan bilkul sahi he
 Yes, we are a Hindu nation
 haalanki, shivasena ne yah bhi kaha ki centre main jabase modi sarkaar bani he tab se hindutv ke samarthan main log khulkar saamne aa rahe hai
 But the truth is that even when the Congress government at the Center was appeasing the Muslim in the name of pseudo-secularism, the Shiv Sena used to raise its voice
 vidi saavarkar se lekar bal thakare baar-baar yahi kehete rahe ki bharat shat-pratishat hindu raashtra he
 Supporting Mohan Bhagwat, Uddhav Thackeray said, 'mohan Bhagwat has called Hindutva
 unhone vichaar vyakt kiya he ki ham hindu raashtra hai
 Due to this statement, the Sangh Sanchalak is competing to say even Hitler, there is nothing surprising in this also
 jis desh kaa kalash chhadam dharmanirpekshata kii jarjar neenv par khadaa ho or jahaan muslim tushtikaran hi raajnneetik roji-roti kaa udyog ban gaya ho, vahaan doosraa kya ho saktaa he?'hamanen pehle hi kaha ki bharat hindu raashtra helekh main aage likhaa gaya he, 'modi jab se desh ke pradhanmantri ban gaye hai tab se hindutvvaadi vichaaron ke kanth foot gaye hai, yah kahana sach he par desh main jab congress kii sarkaar thi or jab muslim vot bank ke liye hindu samaaj kaa galaa dabaaya ja rahaa tha, tab bhi pehle vidi saavarkar or phir shivesna pramukh ne barambar taal thonkkar kaha ki haa, ham shat-pratishat hindu raashtra he or is desh ke bhaal par chamakane vaale hindutv ke tike ko koi ponch nahin saktaa
 The Shiv Sena chief has shown such a sharp emblem of Hindutva that the Congress and his children in secrecy in his Badnawal have been exposed to secularism
 'hindutv vichaaron ke chalate piem bane modiunhone kaha, 'modi pradhanmantri bane to apane prakhar hindutv vichaaron ke chalate
 All the Hindu society of this country voted fiercely in favor of Shiv sena-bjp due to caste, creed and being only Hindu
 congress kii muslim chatukaarita ke hairaan hindu samaaj ne tab chhadam dharmanirpekshata ko supurd-e-khaak kiya
 Not a single Muslim MP could win the elections in the entire northern provinces of Delhi, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar

 They are opposing certain provisions of the Marketing Discipline Guidelines issued by the Ministry of Petroleum, which include heavy fines and legal action
 distributor bazaar main silendaron ke chaar tarah ke daam, chook rahit sil nahin lagane kaa bhi virodh kar rahe he
 The effect will be that domestic gas cylinders will not be supplied during the strike
 haalanki, is hadtaal se jaruri sevaaon, jaise aspataal aadi, ko alag rakhaa gaya he
 Representatives of the Federation of LPG Distributors of India and the Federation of All India LPG Distributors told a press conference that there are four prices for a single cylinder 
 gharelu istemaal vaale silendar kii keemat 410-450 rupye ke bich he, vahiin gurudwara or anya sansthaaon ko isse kuch adhik lekin bazaar bhav se kuch kam par silendar diya jaataa he
 Along with this, market-priced cylinders are also available at different prices according to their weight
 inaki maang he ki silendaron ke daam main vividhta kam se kam kii jaae
 Apart from this, to prevent gas theft from cylinders, the Petroleum Ministry should install leakage proof seal, so that the theft is completely stopped
 inhone sawaal uthaaya ki agar mantralay aisi sil laane main asafal he to iskaa khamiyaja distributor kyon uthaae kyonki vah har delivery main ke peeche to nahin ja sakate
 The distributors demand that 2 to 5 kg cylinders being sold illegally in the market should be immediately banned
 iske saath hi 2 se 5 kilo main nae silendar launch kiye jaaen or inkaa market price gaiyrkanoonee taur par bikne vaale silendar se kam rakhaa jaae
 Along with this, opportunities for compromise should be given in complaints related to distribution
 inkaa kahana he ki kai baar anchaahi galati hoti he
 Sometimes the lack of communication also causes problems, but, directly, fines are imposed
 aisi samasya ko kam karne ke liye vaazib maamalon main shikayatakarta se baatcheet kaa mauka diya jaae
 PN Seth, acting vice president of All India LPG Distributor Federation and Chandra Prakash, general secretary, says the strike will be indefinite

 haalanki, vahaan maujuud congress or bispi saansadon ne unhen manaane kii koshish kii, baavjood iske mayawati apane chalange par kaayam najar ain or sadsyta se istipha de diya
 But the big question is, will Mayawati's resignation be accepted? This question is because Mayawati did not follow the rules for resigning from the membership of Parliament
 niyam ye he ki sansad ke donon sadanon kaa koi bhi sadsy jab apni sadsyta se istipha detaa he to mahaj ek line main likhakar sambanddh chairman yaa spikar ko saunpna hota he
 Whereas Mayawati submitted her resignation to the office of the Rajya Sabha chairman, which is of three pages
 niyam ke mutabik istife ke saath na hi koi kaaran bataaya jaataa he or na hi us par koi safai di jaati he
 That is, no Member of Parliament can write the reason for resigning in resignation
 siddhu kaa istipha bhi hua tha naamanzoorrod rej kii ghatana main doshi paae jane ke baad 2006 main tatkaaleen loksabhaa saansad navjot singh siddhu ne apni sadsyta se istipha diya tha
 But Sidhu's resignation was rejected by the then Lok Sabha speaker Somnath Chatterjee
 jiske baad siddhu ne dobaaraa bina koi kaaran bataae apana tyaagptr spikar ko diya, jise manjuur kar liya gaya
 Captain Amarinder was not even resigned
 In November 2016, the Supreme Court gave a decision to continue construction work on the Sutlej Yamuna Link (SYL) canal
 is faisle se naaraaz hokar tatkaaleen congress saansad captain amarinder singh loksabhaa spikar ko apana istipha bhej diya tha
 Captain Amarinder, in his resignation, also explained the reason for his resignation, which was not accepted as not suitable
 yani saaf he ki jis praaroop main mayawati ne apana istipha diya he, wo manjuur nahin kiya jayega

 The National Advisory Council (NAC) wants all types of bills to pass through the public eye, from preparation to finalization
 aam taur par, jab kisi vidheyak ko sansad main pesh kiya jaataa he tabhi uski vishay suchi ko saarvajanik kiya jaataa he
 The NAC is finalizing a 'pre-legislative process'
 isse sansad main rakhe jane vaale vidheyak ko cabinet kii manjuuri milane se pehle us par saarvajanik charchaa karana pakkaa ho jayega
 This step has been taken at a time when the UPA government is embroiled in a dispute with several groups associated with civil society over the subject matter of bills like Lokpal, Whistle Blowers and Communal Violence
 agar enesi kii chali to sarkaar ko vibhinn kanoonon ke bare main janata se 'salaah-mashvira' karne or uske vibhinn virgon ke vichaar sambandhit vidheyak main shaamil karne ke mushkil daur se guzarana hoga
 NAC member Aruna Roy says, "at a time when the demand for people's participation and their views in the drafting of an important law is arising, these democratic aspirations should be put in place
" soch-vichaar kii ek aisi uchit prakriya sthapit karnaa jaruri he, jisase nyaaypalika or karypalika ke visheshadhikaron kaa hanan na ho, lekin saath hi nagarikon ko apni raay saamne rakhane or un par vichaar karwaane kaa mauka bhi mili
 Some of the key points of the pre-legislative process are: 1
 sabhi pramukh vidheyakon or nitiyon kii ghoshnaa kii shuruyaat green paper se kii jaae jisamen uski pramukh baton ko rakhaa jaae taaki us par saarvajanik bahes ho sake
 2
 iske baad doosraa charan white paper kaa hoga jisamen sarkaar thos prastaav rakhkar spasht karegi ki uske prastaavon kii kya disha rahegi
 3
 kisi bhi vidheyak ke masaude par green yaa white paper aae yaa na aae, lekin sansad main pesh kiye jane se do maheene pehle use janata ke saamne rakhaa janaa chahie
 The situation at this time is that before the law is enacted, the public can express their opinion only when the Bill is referred to the Standing Committee of Parliament, which considers it only when the Parliament decides it
 lekin sej kanoon sareekhe kai pramukh kanoonon ko kabhi sthaayee samiti ke paas nahin bheja gaya
 It is not yet clear whether the NAC will play a larger role in the future as a differential plank between policy governors and public opinion

 Former Minister of Finance on Reserve Bank of India controversy, Shant Sinha said, "for the first time in history, Government has to give a direction order under Section 7 of Reserve Bank
 iskaa matlab he ki baatcheet se koi nateeja nahin niklaa
 It is written in section 7 itself that before giving this order, the government will have to consult with the Governor of the Reserve Bank
 kya vah hua yaa nahin hua? agar kansaltesan hua or rigerv bank ke governor uske liye raji nahin hue jo sarkaar kaa suzav tha tabhi sarkaar ko is dhara kaa istemaal karnaa padaa he

 tab sarkaar ne unhen nirdesh diya he dhara 7 ke tahat
 "the government is hell bent on destroying institutions," Sinha said, "this is a very serious issue and i think on a larger scale, perhaps this government is bent on destroying every institution that our independent India has There has been a huge role in history or even before

 Mulayam has an accepted sentiment, he remembers someone's favor but Amitabh is the opposite
 unamem sirf lene kaa bhav he
 i gave them time, gave them a sense
 2
 Mulayam Singh admits that he never fired me
 3
 On Azam Khan - as much evil as you have to do, which you have to abuse, i have said that my ears are bad
 jisko juuta maarna he maar le, main dhul saaf kar luungaa
 If someone wants to spit on me, then spit it, i will clean it
 jisko jitani bhadaas nikaalani he nikaal le, main chup rahoonga
 One hitch equals 100 baht
 jo hamaari aalochana kar rahe hai, sab hamaare bade hai

 amitabh bachchanpar- pichley dinon amit ji ne bayaan diya ki amar singh mere bhai hai, wo mere liye kuch bhi kahen, main sun lunga
 i am not afraid, i do not bow down, but after Amit ji's statement, i will not be able to speak
 5
 The BJP has openly attacked Amitabh in the Bofors case in the past
 khud arun jetali veepi singh ke kehane par jaanch ke liye switzraland gaye the
 You will be the child of Rajiv Gandhi, if you holiday with him, you will be on the target of others
 6
 Modi and Amitabh's relationship is because of me
 maine hi 'paa' movie ko tex free karaane ke liye amitabh ko modi ji se milaayaa tha
 Modi ji watches movies less but he watched 'paa'
 or donon ke bich samanvay ho gaya
 7
 gujarat tourism ko badhaava dene ke liye modi ji ne amitabh se kaha to amitabh ne mujhase poocha ki kya karun
 i said aaj modi ji or amitabh main nazdikiyaan dekhi ja sakati hai
 i have not talked to Modi ji for a long time
 piem banane se pehle khub hoti thi
 Later on the phone, he asked how Bhaiya Hall was
 aaj to cartoon bhi chhapate hai, donon kii photo chhapati he or neeche likhaa hota he, koun bada kalakaar
 8
 panama paper liks par- aap kah sakate hai ki amitabh siyasat main nahin hai, unki patni siyasat main hai to wo siyasat kii garmi se kaise batch sakate hai
 To say that Amitabh is not in politics is wrong
 'meetha meetha gapp or kadava kadava thu' nahin chalegaa
 9
 jo he naam vaala vahi to badnaam he
 Which BJP leader left them when they were with the Congress
 sabane kaha ki boforce kii barphy aapane khai, aaj modi ji ke saath dikhenge to congress kaa hamalaa hoga
 Politics is the bread of vice
 10
 Be it the old case of FERA or the current case of Panama, where did Amitabh go wrong? On this question, we do not think, we know but will not speak after his statement
 panama maamle main jaanch supreme court kii nigaraanee main ho rahi he, isliye jaanch agency prabhavit nahin hogi
 The court is just watching
 isliye modi sarkaar ke program main unke shaamil hone se jaanch par koi fark nahin padegaa
 The matter is now with the court, the Supreme Court has taken cognizance of it, they will see how the money has gone, whether it has gone through hawala
 unka iskar kaa purana maamla bhi he jise supreme court ne haal main kholaa he
 11
 amitabh se duuri par: ye meraa vyaktigat jivan he
 Time, health and relationships are not in our hands, but it hurts but i will not speak on camera
 jo kuch bhi hua, iske liye main hi jimmedaar hum
 Because if i am giving preference to someone more than my wife, family and children, then i am impractical, foolish
 ye log vyaavhaarik hai, praasangik log hai
 These are the people who shape the art
 kalakaar log hai
 When Mulamayam will be in power from UP, he will speak with him, UP has power because there is less crime here
 jab modi ji ke saath honge to unki jhaadu lekar safai karte dikhenge
 So these artists are people, don't mind
 12
 In the morning shift, he will be seen cremating the mother in a scene, in the afternoon he will be seen hugging the brother, in the night shift, he will be seen celebrating honeymoon with the heroine
 ek din main kai rup dekh lete hai log
 Whenever you live, people put many faces on one face
 13
 Today's script is Narendra Modi
 wo chadhate suraj hai
 When the world is saluting him, why not Amitabh Bachchan brother
 14
 On two years of Modi government: i am not a man of the system, so i cannot tell what is happening inside
 lekin jo dikh rahaa he ki jo kaam congress 60 saal main kar pai, wo kaam modi ji ne do saal main kar diya
 15
 congress ne subhash chandra bose se lekar patel, kamraj samet apane tamaam netaaon ko itane saalon main khatm kiya, wo modi ji ne apni party main do saal main kar diya
 Now Modi and Amit Shah are the leaders in the BJP
 udhar congress main sonia or rahul
 16
 congress ne mujhe tak nahin choda, maine unki sarkaar bachaai, unke chidambaram ne mujhe hi tihaad bhijwa diya
 Police was with them
 shibu sorain maamle main sansad kaa maamla sansad main or mere maamle main chargeshit
 However, the court found nothing against me
 17
 On UP elections and Akhilesh government: Mulayam's ability to contest, Akhilesh's good face, good name and Shivpal's dovetail can bring SP government back
 akhilesh se main bhi naaraaz hota hum par jab saamne wo ankal kehete hai to sab bhula detaa hum
 There is something in them
 haa, akhilesh ke vidhayakon or mantriyon se kuch logon kii naaraazgi ho sakati he lekin akhilesh kii vyaktigat chhavi acchhee he
