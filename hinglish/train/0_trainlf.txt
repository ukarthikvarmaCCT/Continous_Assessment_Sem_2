 This work includes dubbing and editing
 aisa kisi tarah kii information li na ho isliye kiya ja rahaa he
 Many people have access to information and screenplays
 bas, isiilie unhone saavdhaanee baratane kaa faisla kiya
 Confirming this, Prakash Jha says, “we have our own equipment for dubbing and editing
 post production kaam kai jagah hota he, isliye dar bana rahata he
 These days even a pen drive is dangerous and i did not want to take a chance
 ” satyagrah 30 agast ko relies ho rahi he
 Let's be careful with the accident
 desh kii sabase puraani party kii kaman congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ke haathon main he
 On Sunday, in the presence of PCC delegate and AICC members in the plenary session of the Congress, the proposal to elect the members of the Working Committee to party president Rahul Gandhi has been unanimously passed
 ab jald hi congress ke kaarysmiti (CWC) ke sadasyon kii naam par muhar laga sakate hai
 This means that Rahul will now decide the names of his team members themselves
 gauratlab he ki congress main kaarysmiti hi ahm faisle lene vaala sheersh nikaay he
 Therefore every veteran leader of the party wants to see his name among the members of the working committee
 ravivaar ko congress kii nai kaarysmiti ke sadasyon ke naam chayan karne kaa adhikaar rahul ko sarvasammati se saunp diya gaya he
 Explain that after becoming Congress President, an important task in front of Rahul Gandhi is to carry out the formation of the party working committee
 kaarysmiti main congress adhyaksh samet kul 25 sadsy hote hai
 Of these 12 members are nominated and 12 are elected
 congress ke planry seshan main party kii kaarysmiti ke sabhi sadasyon ko manonith karne kaa adhikaar rahul ko saunp diya gaya he
 However, it is usually the Congress President who nominates CWC members
 congress ke sabhi AICC sadasyon ne rahul ko CWC members ke liye adhikrut kiya
 Rahul Gandhi will now nominate 24 members
 is tarah12 kaarysmiti ke sadasyon ke liye chunaav nahin karaae jaaenge
 It was already believed that the party's effort was that AICC members should hand over the rights of electing all the members of the Working Committee to the Congress President Rahul Gandhi unanimously, then Rahul should form his own working committee accordingly
 congress ke anumaan ke mutabik hua or kaarysmiti ke sadasyon ke chunane kaa adhikaar rahul ko saunp diya gaya
 In fact, most of the leaders in the Congress believed that because at this time the party needs to unite and fight against the BJP under Rahul's leadership, in such a situation there is no need to give a message like mutual tussle between the leaders by holding elections for 12 seats of working committee within the party
 Does not make sense congress main hota loktantrik prakriya kaa paalancongress netaa arpyen singh kaa kahana tha- ‘bijepi main to chunavi prakriya hi nahin hoti, us par media chup rahata he, jabaki congress main to baqayada loktantrik prakriya kaa paalan hota he
 In the election of the Congress president also happened in front of everyone and will be done further
 ’kul milakar rahul bhi samaj gaye hai ki, adarshavaad or yatharthwaad kii siyasat main bharosa yatharthwaad par hi karnaa hoga
 That is why Rahul is being used in the Youth Congress and NSUI in a light-hearted way by making changes, but in the original Congress, the same thing seems to be happening in the past
 rahul gandhi ne badla siyasat kaa tareekakarib 14 saal pehle raajnneeti main aagaaj karne se congress adhyaksh banane tak kaa safar tay karte hue rahul badale hai
 At the same time, the way of his politics has also changed
 raajnneeti main aate hi rahul congress main loktantr ko badhaava dene kii muhim chalaate dikhe
 Team Rahul was seen advocating for holding elections within the party on the lines of America and England
 2006 main hyderabad adhiveshan main party ke mahasachiv bane rahul ko party ke chaatr sanghathan enesayuai or youth congress kaa prabhaar mila
 Here Rahul ended the nomination process and started holding elections
 rahul ke is kadam kii party ke bheetar hi kaaphi aalochana hui
 On this policy of Rahul, the leaders said that the thinking is good, but the politics of India is not ready for this
 saath hi zyaadaatar jagahon par paison ke andhadhundh istemaal kii khabaren ain or netaaon ke bacchon- rishtedaaron ko aasaani se pad mil gaye
 Yojnarahul, who has been in cold storage since 2014, did not stop here, in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, he implemented the primary scheme on 15 seats as a pilot project
 iske tahat loksabhaa seat se party tikat daavedaaron ke bich chunaav karake ummidavaar kaa chayan kiya gaya
 Although there was an anti-congress atmosphere in the 2014 elections, the Congress lost all of the primary seats
 haalanki, 2014 ke baad se ye yojana puri tarah thande baste main he
 In fact, the old strategists of the party believe that by adopting such a method, there is a split between the party before the election and there is a quarrel, which the party suffers
 abhi america yaa england kii tarj par bharat main siyasat nahin ho sakati
 Also, when every party runs from this system, then it should be implemented in Congress
 jaisaa qi, america yaa england main hota he
 Many changes were made after this, Rahul's pilot project was not stopped completely, but the election process in the Youth Congress and NSUI were changed a lot
 haa, mul congress main rahul kii chunaav karaane kii yojana ko thande baste main daal diya gaya he
 Perhaps Rahul has also become aware of the reality of the politics of India
 lekin apane dil kii khwaish ko rahul bhala kaise puri tarah maar dete
 That is why he rejected the advice of the leaders to nominate the party president, he could have easily nominated the party president after Sonia Gandhi
 rahul kii zid ke baad hi party adhyaksh ke chunaav kii puri prakriya hui
 However, as expected, no leader filed nomination in front of Rahul and Rahul won the election of party president without voting
 darasal, party netaaon kaa kahana he ki, party main loktantr kaa matlab he ki, pehle aapasi baatcheet se, mil baith kar faisla ho jaae vahi acha he
 There are differences between elections within the party and general elections
 aam chunaav ke baad bhi har party ke jite haare ummidavaaron ko ek hokar kisi se muqabla nahin karnaa hota, jabaki party ke bheetar chunaav hone ke baad dilon main khatas aa jaati he, aapasi aarope pratyarope hote hai, jiske baad ek hokar duusari party se ladane main pareshaani aana tay he
 The spectators will also achieve a special achievement during the india-pakistan Superfinal on Sunday

 The ICC (international Cricket Council) estimates that the match will see around 32 million 40 million people worldwide
 yadi aisa hua, to yah cricket itihaas kaa teesraa sabase zyada dekha janaa vaala muqabla hoga
 In fact, the record for the most watched matches was made in the 2011 World Cup final, which was watched by 55 million 8 million people
 duusare sthaan par bharat or paak ke bich khelaa gaya world semifinal he, jise 49 karod 50 lakh logon ne dekha tha

 In this meeting, in addition to the GST compensation cess given to the states, the issue of increasing the collection can be discussed
 darasal, yah baithak aise samay hone ja rahi he jab jiesti collection ummid se kam rahane ko lekar chintaa badhati ja rahi he

 'team india main jagah pani he, to paas karnaa hi hoga yo-yo test
 Yes! This is a condition that has become the yardstick of selection in the Indian cricket team at this time
 is test ko paas karne main naakaam hue bade se bade diggaj khilaadi team india se baahar chal rahe hai
 But the BCCI wants to apply this yo-yo test to under-19 and junior level cricket as well
 lekin under-19 or india-e team ke coach rahul dravid bisisiai kii is yojana se ittefaq nahin rakhte hai
 Dravid believes that every player at the level of junior cricket should first focus on his skills
 jiske baad dravid or junior team management kaa samarthan nahin milane parabisisiaiko is yojana kaa vichaar radd karnaa padaa
 What is Yo Yo fitness test? Let me tell you that in kio-yo test, two rows are made at a distance of 20 meters with the help of many 'cones'
 ek khilaadi rekha ke peeche apana paanv rakhkar shuruyaat karata he or nirdesh milte hi daudna shuru karata he
 The player runs between two consecutive lines and has to turn when the beep rings
 har ek minute yaa isi tarah se teji badhati jaati he
 If the line is not reached on time, then two more 'beeps' have to catch pace
 agar khilaadi do chhoron par teji hasil nahin kar paata he to pareekshan roak diya jaataa he
 The entire process is based on software, in which the results are recorded
 ek angreji akhbaar ke mutabikneshnal cricket academike ek adhikari ne kaha, ‘bhartiya team ke trainer ne under-19 team main yo-yo test ko shaamil karne kii koshish kii thi lekin dravid ne saaf kar diya ki junior cricket ko isaki jarurat nahin he
 Players should focus on their performance at this age
 unhone kaha, ‘fitness jaruri he lekin agar vah ran bana rahe hai or wicket le rahe hai to yahi chayan kaa aadhaar hona chahie
 ' samaajawaadee party ke varisht netaa or uparashtrapati pad ke ummidavaar rahe rashid masood ne bagawati tevar akhriyaar karte hue aarope lagaaya he ki sapa mukhiya mulaayam singh yadav main ab faisla karne kii kuvat nahin rahi
 Face recognition, win prizes
 bhaag lene ke lieclic karankuch maheenon se sapa main alag-thalag pade rajyasabha sadsy masood ne kaha, ‘‘main sapa kii bhalaai chahta hum, lekin meri koi nahin sun rahaa
 Netaji (mulayam) is no longer able to decide
 jahaan tak mujhe jaankaree he ki ve biimaar hai or party main nirnay khud nahin le rahe
 On September 26, 64-year-old Masood organized a rally in his home district Saharanpur
 is raily main kahin bhi sapa kaa binar or mulaayam singh yadav kii tasviir nahin dikhi
 Those close to Masood say that if the SP leadership did not listen to some of his sayings, he might decide to leave the party
 party chhodane ke sandarbh main masood ne kaha, ‘‘philhal main sapa main hum
 It is true that many parties are in touch with me, because they know that i am angry with the leadership of my party
 maine abhi koi faisla nahin kiya he
 i want SP to be strong, but nobody is ready to listen to me
 ’’masood ke is bagawati tevar ke bare main sapa pravaktaa mohan singh ne kaha, ‘‘party or hamaare netaa (mulaayam) rashid masood se baat kar rahe hai
 Efforts are being made to persuade them
 abhi unhone aisa kuch nahin kiya he ki unke khilaaf anushaasanamak karrwai kii jaae
 Mulayam Singh only decides in the party
 hamaari party main kisi kii manamaani nahin chalati
 '' ab is baat se shaayad hi koi asahmat ho ki aaj-kal naukariyaan email se hi milti hai
 Just writing a good email can provide great jobs, and many have found it
 to vahiin email ne bahuton kii naukariyaan chhini bhi hai
 So in this case, you have to be extra careful while sending emails
 isi ke maddenjar ham khaas aapako bataa rahe hai ki email bhejte vakt kya-kya satarkta barti jaani chahie
 1
 sahi vaakya sanrachana kaa istemaal karankisi ko bhi galat vaakya sanrachana dekhnaa pasand nahin
 It may be that the next person writes himself wrongly, but he does not expect others to do so
 2
 Use spell check and avoid short form
 You should write U, great to gr8 and because cuz
 spel check kaa istemaal karen nahin to log aapako syriasli lenaa band kar denge
 3
 resiver ko puraa sammaan denoficial mail bhejte vakt aapako vishesh taur parasatarktabartani hogi
 Dear Sir / Madam is no longer mandatory, but avoid what's up and name the next with all due respect
 4
 If you are angry or emotional, then avoid sending mail
 It happens to all of us that we live in a cold state about something, and all those things are seen while writing emails
 koshish karen ki email point-tu-point ho or aap aage kii baat ke liye apane shabd bachaa kar rakhen5
 Avoid replying to all
 If you are having a bad mood with one person, then you have to be very cautious and communicate only with a particular person rather than getting the most involved and invoking everyone
 6
 Use 'please' and 'thank you' wisely, people understand that the next flattery is trying, but by saying please and thank you once or twice you are helping yourself
 7
 Avoid emoticons, fancy fonts and patterned backgrounds
 Today, we are using social media so much that we do not even know and we even attach smiley in sending emails
 aise main aap vishesh satarkta baraten
 Speaking for the first time on exit poll, Congress leader Ajay Maken has said that if the results are according to the polls, then i take responsibility

 The party fought by giving my face, i take responsibility and accountability
 maakan kii raay main sahi aankadon par to abhi sanshay he par aisa nahin ki koi do de rahaa he or koi 18
 Looking at the exit poll, these are showing emotions
 ajay maakan ne kaha ki pichhali baar hi log chaahate the ki kejariwal siem bane par kuch seat kam rah gayi, ab log chaahate hai unhen puraa paanch saal mili
 The Congress leader said that when we took our roadmap, people did not listen
 aisa lagata he is baar logon ko paanch saal kejariwal hi chahie
 Will support if a few seats remain low? Maken replied to Taka on the question of, the question does not arise

 Now they want him to get a full five years
 maakan kaa kahana he ki congress ke hi vot kejariwal kii party 'aap' ko mili hai

 When asked about Sheila Dixit, the face of the development of the Congress party in Delhi, when asked that she did not appear this time in the elections, Maken said that she came where Sheila ji was called

 Whom to explain
 beti ko yaa beti ke baap ko
 Are they the only ones who do this or are there many people who give scooter bikes to their children before their legal age
 aakhir kya jaldi thi ki in janaab ne apni saat saal kii beti ko skuti kaa handle pakadaa diya
 The records which are included daily in the world of the famous books of records are no less than a junk, but for that junk, one is getting his children to recite religious texts and some are going to dance for three to four days
 hamen pataa nahin ki hyderabad ke is pita kii aisi koi manshaa he yaa nahin lekin koi bhi samaj saktaa he ki yah apni or apni beti donon kii zindagi khatare main daal rahaa he
 It may be that in the course of saving them on the road, someone innocently bumped and killed his car somewhere else
 papa ji ne hamaari sahyogi uma sudhir ko kaha ki ye jo bhi kahati he main use manaa nahin karata hum
 If you have any father of this level in the audience, please check yourself
 iske papa ji ne kaha ki chaar saal kii umr se skuti chalaa rahi he yani teen saal ho gaye ise skuti chalaate hue
 This video is telling that just because Mummy is a father, there is no sense of right understanding in the world
 ham log maa baap ko lekar kuch zyaada hi bhavuk ho jate hai or dev devi banane lagate hai
 Mummy Daddy also begins to think that he is the God of the calendar
 pleez khud ko simpal maanav samajhnaa shuru kiijie
 The extent was that Papa ji was having a laugh while talking in front of the camera
 aisa bilkul na karen, is tarah kii chetavanee ke baad bhi aise logon kii kami nahin jo bilkul vaisaa hi karenge
 The record of rearing a family in Hyderabad may not be available to all, but those who make such records are now found in many families
 mumbai ke tamaam railway steshnon par sisitivi naamak sarvyaapee or sarvagyani yantra laga hi hoga, phir bhi kaise pataa nahin chalata ki kuch ladke chalati rail se khelte hue stesan se guzar jate hai
 Now see how these school children climb into the moving train
 local ke khulne ke baad chadh kar dikhaane kii masti main ye sab kar rahe hai
 Attempts to touch the surface of the platform by bending over the moving train
 platform kii sataha se paanv ragadate jate hai
 School children seem to have learned from this young man who is bending over and touching the ground
 kuch ladke ajeeb ajeeb tareeke se latake hue hai
 Even after the platform arrives, they are standing on the roof of the train and hanging from the window
 ab is stant se inhen jaan kaa khatara to he hi, inaki vajah se koi or bhi maaraa ja saktaa he
 Slipping on the platform can also catch someone else
 ye tasviren aapane pehle bhi dekhi hongi
 The problem is that the problem has become just a matter of showing
 rail prashasan ne aakhir is par lagaam kyon nahin lagaaya
 Is this also a quality that we want to preserve for the world? deepesh jaise yuva kaa shukriya ki unhone do maheene lagaakar aath ghante ke aise footage record kiye hai
 Looking at these pictures, it seems that it has become easy to do stunts in local by betting on my life
 deepesh jaise yuvaaon ne ek sanstha hi bana lee he waar anguest railway roudi
 This video has been prepared so that the railway administration is able to watch and take action
 sunil singh ne railway protection force ke pashchim railway ayukta anand vijay jha se baat kii
 He says that there is not enough strength to curb this
 inhen yah bhi dekhnaa hota he ki yatri majaburi main lataka he yaa jaanboojhkar stant kar rahaa he
 is peculiar
 aap inaki baat suniye or saath saath tasveeron ko dekhakar faisla kiijie ki koi chat par majaburi ke tahat khadaa he
 The balance of standing on the roof of a moving rail suddenly comes under some compulsion or it will require fatal practice
 tippaniyan If this boy bends under a bridge then what a compulsion
 kya majaburi main rail kii chat par chalane kaa koi kanoon he is desh main
 Life is a big cost or helplessness
 vaise railway ne pichley saal 2000 logon ke khilaaf karrwai kii he magar lagata he ki karrwai se logon main dar paidaa nahin ho sakaa he
 Last year i
e
 in 2015, 806 people fell from Mumbai local
 kya ye hamaari naakaami nahin he ki itani badi taadaad main maut kii sankhya ko roak nahin sake
 Is this an impossible task? pichley saal 17 logon kii karant lagane se maut ho gai he
 40 died during a stunt
 pole se takaraane kii vajah se 2015 main 13 logon ne apni jaan ganvaa di
 However, the death toll in non-official figures is much higher
 kya is beemaari ko ek hafte main kaabo nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Mumbai's railway station is also very sensitive in terms of security
 aatanki ghatnaon kaa shikaar rahi he mumbai local
 Even after this, if this is the ravaya of railway administration, then anyone can come and do anything like this
 ye stant bataa rahe hai ki ham sudhare nahin hai
 Safety is not our priority
 yah sirf prashasan kii naakaami nahin he balki ek naagarik samaaj ke rup main bhi hamaari naakaami he ki in trainon main chalane vaale log in sab harkaton ko lekar saamaanya ho gaye hai
 There is a problem and there is a local solution, so there are many problems within it
 local kii bheed jaanaleva bhi hoti he
 People are suffocated by the tamping
 76 lakh logon ko yahaan kii local rail rose dhoti he
 The answer to everything cannot be that all this happens in the local area
 record kii jagaprasiddh kitabon main rozaana duniya bhar se shaamil hone vaale record kisi kabad se kam nahin hai magar us kabad ke liye koi apane bacchon ko dharmik granth ratwa rahaa he to koi teen chaar din tak naachata hi ja rahaa he
 We do not know whether this father of Hyderabad has any such intention or not, but no one can understand that it is putting both his and his daughter's life in danger
 ho saktaa he ki sadak par inhen bachaane ke chakkar main koi bekasoor apni gaadi kahin or bhida de or maaraa jaae
 Papa Ji told our colleague Uma Sudhir that i do not refuse what she says
 agar aap darshakon main is level kaa koi papa he to pleez khud ko check kiijie
 Its father said that since the age of four, Scooty has been running, that has been driving Scooty for three years
 yah video bataa rahaa he ki sirf mummy papa ho jane se duniya main sahi galat samajhane kii akl nahin aa jaati he
 We get very emotional about the parents and start making Goddess
 mummy daddy ko bhi lagane lagata he ki ve calendar vaale bhagwaan hai
 Please start considering yourself as simple human
 had to ye thi ki camere ke saamne papa ji ko baat karte vakt hansi hi aa rahi thi
 Do not do this at all, even after such a warning, there is no shortage of people who will do exactly that
 hyderabad ke ek parivaar ke laalan paalan kaa record sabakaa nahin ho saktaa magar aise record banane vaale ab kai pariwaron main mil jate hai
 All the railway stations of Mumbai will have a ubiquitous and omniscient device called CCTV, yet how is it not known that some boys pass through the station playing on the moving rail
 ab aap in schuli bacchon ko dekhie kis tarah se chalati train main chadh jate hai
 They are doing all this in the fun of climbing up after the local opening
 chalati train se jhuk kar platform kii sataha ko chune kaa prayaas karte hai
 The feet are rubbed off the surface of the platform
 schuli bacchon ne lagata he is noujvaan se siikhaa hoga jo jhukkar zamin chhu rahaa he
 Some boys are hanging out in strange weird ways
 platform aane ke baad bhi train kii chat par khadey hai or khidki se latake hue hai
 Now they are at risk of life with this stunt, due to them, someone else can also be killed
 platform par inke phisalane se koi doosraa bhi chapet main aa saktaa he
 You must have seen these photos before
 samasya ye he ki samasya sirf dikhaane kii hi chiz banakar rah gai he
 Why did the railway administration not control it? kya ye bhi koi khubi he jise ham duniya ke liye bachaakar rakhana chaahate hai
 Thanks to a youth like Dipesh, he took two months to record eight hours of such footage
 in tasveeron ko dekhakar lagata he ki jaan kii baazi lagaakar local main stant karnaa kitna aasaan ho gaya he
 Youngsters like Deepesh have formed an institution, War Angest Railway Rowdy
 ye video isliye taiyaar kiya gaya he taaki rail prashasan dekhe or karrwai karne ke liye majaboor ho
 Sunil Singh spoke to Western Railway Commissioner Anand Vijay Jha of the Railway Protection Force
 unka kahana he ki paryaapt sankhya bal nahin he is par lagaam lagane ke liye
 They also have to see whether the passenger is hanging under compulsion or doing a deliberate stunt
 ajeeb he
 Listen to them and decide by looking at the pictures together that someone is standing under compulsion on the roof
 chalati rail kii chat par khadey rahane kaa santulan achaanak kisi majaburi main aa jaataa he yaa iske liye jaanaleva abhyaas kii zarurat hoti hogi
 The comments jaise ye ladkaa kisi pul ke neeche jhukta he to kya majaburi he
 Is there any law in compulsion to walk on the roof of the railway in this country
 jaan kii keemat badi he yaa majaburi
 Although the Railways has taken action against 2000 people last year, but it seems that action has not created fear among the people
 pichley saal yani jo 2015 tha usamen mumbai local se gir kar 806 logon kii maut ho gai
 Isn't it our failure to prevent such a large number of deaths? kya ye bilkul hi asambhav kaam he
 Last year 17 people died due to electrocution
 40 kii maut stant karne ke dauraan hui he
 In 2015, 13 people lost their lives due to hitting the polls
 haalanki gaiyr-sarkari aankadon main marane waalon kii sankhya kahin zyaada he
 Can't this disease be controlled in a week? suraksha ke lihaaz se bhi mumbai kaa railway stesan behad samvedansheel he
 Mumbai local has been the victim of terrorist incidents
 iske baad bhi agar railway prashasan kaa yah raivaya he to koi bhi is tarah kii harakat karata hua aa saktaa he or kuch bhi kar saktaa he
 These stunts are telling that we have not improved
 suraksha hamaari praathamikta nahin he
 It is not just the failure of the administration but it is also our failure as a civil society that the people walking in these trains have become normal about all these activities
 ek samasya or he local samaadhaan he to iske bheetar kai tarah kii samasya bhi he
 Local crowd is also deadly
 thuns kar logon ke chalane se dam bhi ghutata he
 The local railway carries 76 lakh people daily
 har baat kaa yahi jawaab nahin ho saktaa ki local main to hota hi rahata he ye sab
 If you have any father of this level in the audience, please check yourself
 iske papa ji ne kaha ki chaar saal kii umr se skuti chalaa rahi he yani teen saal ho gaye ise skuti chalaate hue
 This video is telling that just because Mummy is a father, there is no sense of right understanding in the world

 The balance of standing on the roof of a moving rail suddenly comes under some compulsion or it will require fatal practice

 Life is a big cost or helplessness

 in 2015, 806 people fell from Mumbai local
 kya ye hamaari naakaami nahin he ki itani badi taadaad main maut kii sankhya ko roak nahin sake
 Is this an impossible task? pichley saal 17 logon kii karant lagane se maut ho gai he
 40 died during a stunt
 pole se takaraane kii vajah se 2015 main 13 logon ne apni jaan ganvaa di
 However, the death toll in non-official figures is much higher
 kya is beemaari ko ek hafte main kaabo nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Mumbai's railway station is also very sensitive in terms of security
 aatanki ghatnaon kaa shikaar rahi he mumbai local
 Even after this, if this is the raiyya of railway administration, then anyone can come and do anything like this
 ye stant bataa rahe hai ki ham sudhare nahin hai
 Safety is not our priority
 yah sirf prashasan kii naakaami nahin he balki ek naagarik samaaj ke rup main bhi hamaari naakaami he ki in trainon main chalane vaale log in sab harkaton ko lekar saamaanya ho gaye hai
 There is a problem and there is a local solution, so there are many problems within it
 local kii bheed jaanaleva bhi hoti he
 People are suffocated by the tamping
 76 lakh logon ko yahaan kii local rail rose dhoti he
 The answer to everything cannot be that all this happens in the local area
 aisa bilkul na karen, is tarah kii chetavanee ke baad bhi aise logon kii kami nahin jo bilkul vaisaa hi karenge
 The record of rearing a family in Hyderabad may not be available to all, but those who make such records are now found in many families
 mumbai ke tamaam railway steshnon par sisitivi naamak sarvyaapee or sarvagyani yantra laga hi hoga, phir bhi kaise pataa nahin chalata ki kuch ladke chalati rail se khelte hue stesan se guzar jate hai
 Now see how these school children climb into the moving train
 local ke khulne ke baad chadh kar dikhaane kii masti main ye sab kar rahe hai
 Attempts to touch the surface of the platform by bending over the moving train
 platform kii sataha se paanv ragadate jate hai
 School children seem to have learned from this young man who is bending over and touching the ground
 kuch ladke ajeeb ajeeb tareeke se latake hue hai
 Even after the platform arrives, they are standing on the roof of the train and hanging from the window
 ab is stant se inhen jaan kaa khatara to he hi, inaki vajah se koi or bhi maaraa ja saktaa he
 Slipping on the platform can also catch someone else
 ye tasviren aapane pehle bhi dekhi hongi
 The problem is that the problem has become just a matter of showing
 rail prashasan ne aakhir is par lagaam kyon nahin lagaaya
 Is this also a quality that we want to preserve for the world? deepesh jaise yuva kaa shukriya ki unhone do maheene lagaakar aath ghante ke aise footage record kiye hai
 Looking at these pictures, it seems that it has become easy to do stunts in local by betting on my life

 ab aap in schuli bacchon ko dekhie kis tarah se chalati train main chadh jate hai
 They are doing all this in the fun of climbing up after the local opening
 chalati train se jhuk kar platform kii sataha ko chune kaa prayaas karte hai
 The feet are rubbed off the surface of the platform
 schuli bacchon ne lagata he is noujvaan se siikhaa hoga jo jhukkar zamin chhu rahaa he
 Some boys are hanging out in strange weird ways
 platform aane ke baad bhi train kii chat par khadey hai or khidki se latake hue hai
 Now they are at risk of life with this stunt, due to them, someone else can also be killed
 platform par inke phisalane se koi doosraa bhi chapet main aa saktaa he
 You must have seen these photos before
 samasya ye he ki samasya sirf dikhaane kii hi chiz banakar rah gai he
 Why did the railway administration not control it? kya ye bhi koi khubi he jise ham duniya ke liye bachaakar rakhana chaahate hai
 Thanks to a youth like Dipesh, he took two months to record eight hours of such footage
 in tasveeron ko dekhakar lagata he ki jaan kii baazi lagaakar local main stant karnaa kitna aasaan ho gaya he
 Youngsters like Deepesh have formed an institution, War Angest Railway Rowdy
 ye video isliye taiyaar kiya gaya he taaki rail prashasan dekhe or karrwai karne ke liye majaboor ho
 Sunil Singh spoke to Western Railway Commissioner Anand Vijay Jha of the Railway Protection Force
 unka kahana he ki paryaapt sankhya bal nahin he is par lagaam lagane ke liye
 They also have to see whether the passenger is hanging under compulsion or doing a deliberate stunt
 ajeeb he
 Listen to them and decide by looking at the pictures together that someone is standing under compulsion on the roof
 chalati rail kii chat par khadey rahane kaa santulan achaanak kisi majaburi main aa jaataa he yaa iske liye jaanaleva abhyaas kii zarurat hoti hogi
 The comments jaise ye ladkaa kisi pul ke neeche jhukta he to kya majaburi he
 Is there any law in compulsion to walk on the roof of the railway in this country
 jaan kii keemat badi he yaa majaburi
 Although the Railways has taken action against 2000 people last year, but it seems that action has not created fear among the people
 pichley saal yani jo 2015 tha usamen mumbai local se gir kar 806 logon kii maut ho gai
 Isn't it our failure to prevent such a large number of deaths? kya ye bilkul hi asambhav kaam he
 Last year 17 people died due to electrocution
 40 kii maut stant karne ke dauraan hui he
 In 2015, 13 people lost their lives due to hitting the polls

 It is not just the failure of the administration but it is also our failure as a civil society that the people walking in these trains have become normal about all these activities

 The second Test match between these two teams will start on Friday
 bharat lords main khelaa gaya pehla test match 196 ran ke bade antar se haar gaya tha lekin lakshmana ne kaha ki isse team par koi prabhaav nahin padegaa jisaki chhavi shrinkhalaa ke pehle match main acha pradarshan nahin karne kii ban gayi he
 Laxman told the 'daily Telegraph', 'we have the ability to make a comeback and we have done it before
 ’madhyakram ke is kalatmak ballebaaj ne pichley saal dakshin africa main kheli gayi shrinkhalaa kaa udhaaharan diya jahaan bharat ne centurian main pehla test match ganvaane ke baad joardaar vaapasi karke shrinkhalaa baraabar karavaayi thi

 ’bharat centurian main pari or 25 ran se haar gaya tha lekin durban main usne 87 ran se jeet darj kii
 India was also in a position to win the third match but South Africa was successful in saving the match with a brilliant innings of Jacques Kallis
 england ke khilaaf bharat phir se isi tarah kii sthiti main aa gaya he
 He is currently dominated by England fast bowlers but Laxman is not worried about any foreign attack
 unhone kaha, ‘england ke gendbaajon ne jis tarah se gendbaaji kii main usko bahut mahatv nahin dena chahta
 He only bowled in a good area
 unhen wicket mili
 This is not an unmatched bowling attack that destroys our batting
 ’ lakshmana ne kaha, ‘yadi unhone hamen donon pariyon main 150 ran se kam par roka hota to main sweekaar karata ki unhone hamaari ballebaaji ko tahas nahas kar diya
 The Hyderabad batsman admitted that the absence of chief bowler Zaheer Khan overshadowed the team which only 13 in the Lord's Test due to a hamstring strain
 3 over hi gendbaaji kar paye the
 Laxman said, 'the main difference was 150, 120 runs which we gave to England and this was due to the absence of Zaheer Khan
 yadi hamaare paas jahir jaisaa teesraa niyamit tej gendbaaj hota to phir parinaam alag hota
 "laxman, who played many memorable innings for India, said," We had dismissed his five wickets for 65 runs in the second innings
 ham unhen out karke 260-280 ran ke lakshya kaa peechha karte or ham yah lakshya aasaani se hasil kar lete
 Laxman recollecting that match said, 'to be honest, when on the evening of the third day when Steve asked us for follow, the first wicket partnership between (sadagopan) Ramesh and (shiv Sundar) Das gave us Layed a good foundation
 ’unhone kaha, ‘or jab main tisare din kii shaam ko ballebaaji ke utraa to maine test match main pasa palatney ke bare main nahin sochaa tha
 We came down to the crease with the aim of playing each ball accordingly and sticking to it for the maximum time

 After taking the oath of Prime Minister for the second time, Narendra Modi can visit Maldives for the first time
 yah loksabhaa chunaav ke baad satta main aane par unki pehali dwipaksheeya yatra ho sakati he
 This information came from diplomatic sources and Maldives media reports
 bataa den ki 2014 main jab narendra modi piem bane the to vah sabase pehle bhutan yatra par gaye the
 Diplomatic sources said that Narendra Modi may visit Maldives capital Male in the first fortnight of June
 vahiin maldive kii media kii khabaron par yakeen karen to narendra modi kii yah yatra 7-8 june ko ho sakati he
 Let me tell you that External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj went on a visit to Maldives in March this year
 sushamaa swaraj kii ye maldive yatra pichley varsh november main raashtrapati ibrahim mohammad solih kii sarkaar banane ke baad pehali dwipaksheeya yatra thi
 However, in November last year when Ibrahim Mohammed Solih was taking oath, Narendra Modi also went to attend the event
 23 may ko jab piem narendra modi ne chunaav jeeta to solih ne unhen badhai di thi
 Former Maldives President Mohammad Nasheed also congratulated the PM on his victory and said that India and Maldives will carry the common values of peace, development and prosperity
 Thank You@ibusolihfor your warm wishes
 India greatly values its relations with Maldives

 co / sw5lddddc4— Narendra Modi (@narendramodi)may 23, 2019maldive hi kyon?bataa den ki bharat or maldive ke bich sambandh aamtaur par achche rahe hai
 However, relations between the two countries soured when in February last year, the then President Abdulla Yameen declared a state of emergency in the country
 isi ke saath bharat ke samarthak ke rup main kaam kar rahe kai netaaon ko giraftaar kar liya gaya
 This decision was then criticized by India
 bharat ne kaha ki maldive sarkaar ko chunavi prakriya ke netije kaa sammaan karnaa chahie or raajnneetik bandiyon ko chhodana chahie
 This emergency lasted for 45 days
 abdulla yamin ko haraakaar hi solih maldive ke raashtrapati bane
 Actually, China has been eyeing this island country for a long time
 china aksar is desh kii raajnneeti main dakhal detaa rahata he
 It has invested extensively from China here and is hurting India's business interests
 pyaar main ek lanbaa samay gujaarne ke baad kya aap donon ab shaadi karne bare main soch rahen to isse acchhee baat koi or ho hi nahin sakati
 But the easier it is to speak and listen, the easier it will be in reality
 apni pasand se shaadi karnaa aaj hi kisi taff task se kam nahin hota kyonki koi bhi mata-pita ye nahin chaahate ki unka baccha shaadi jaise maamle main unki pasand kii bajaay apni pasand chune
 Therefore it is very important to take care of some important things before introducing your parents to your partner and talking about marriage
 in ahm baton kaa dhyaan rakhkarpariwaar waalon ko maanane kii is raahamen thodi aasaani jarur ho sakati he
 1
 parivaar main jo aapke sabase kareeb ho use is baat ke bare main bataaen jaise, kai log apane bhai yaa bahan se bahut close hote hai to kuch log aapni bhabhi ko apana raajadaar banaate hai
 If this is the case with you too, first consult your family member so that he can help you in persuading your parents
 2
 If you have made up your mind to get married, then from time to time, keep talking such things in front of your parents so that they can keep track of your mind
 3
 Introduce your partner like a good friend before your parents so that it mixes with your family members a little
 aisa karte samay is baat kaa jarur dhyaan rakhen ki is dauraan aap har jaruri baat ko bhi partner or gharavaalon ke saath share karen taaki unke bich bonding ban sake
 4
 jab bhi mauka mili, baton-baton main apane us achche dost kii baaten karte rahen
 5
 dhairya banaae rakhana bahut jaruri he kayonki kai baar ho saktaa he ki aapke parents aapaki baat samaj kar bhi ignor kar den
 In such a situation, make every effort to try to convince them
 6
 Now that you have told everything about your partner at home, then tell the householders about your partner's good things because the color and caste still have their roots in the homes
 kisi bhi parivaar ke liye apane bachche kii shaadi ek bhaavnaatmak faisla hota he jo ve lenaa chaahate hai
 So it is your responsibility to take care of their feelings

 Whenever there is a debate about love marriage at home, do not forget to present examples of some good and successful weddings
 karan johar ke dharma production kii charchit film 'ungali' kii relies date aakhirkaar final ho gai
 The film by Emraan Hashmi and Kangana Runot will be released on November 21
 ungali kaa nirdesan rencil di silva ne kiya he 
 Apart from Imran and Kangana, the film also stars Sanjay Dutt, Randeep Hooda, Neha Dhupia and Neil Bhupalam
 yah film yuvaaon par aadhaarit he
 When Rensil was asked the reason for the delay of the film, he clearly stated without any excuse that it was a multi star film and it was difficult to get a date from all the stars
 jab kuch dats mili to usee dauraan sanjay dutt ko jail ho gai, to unke seens nahin filmaae ja sake
 Due to these reasons, the date given by the producer of the film Karan Johar earlier, had to be canceled
 lekin ab film banakar taiyaar he
 Delhi has been arguing for many days that what will happen if Modi will contest from Benaras and why Murli Manohar Joshi is sitting on this fight
 magar aaj is khabar main ham aapako bataa rahe hai ki banaras kya sochataa he modi ke bare main
 There is no hitting of data in this news
 bas hawa kaa ek musalasal bayaan he, jo is reporter ne apane haalia banaras pravaas ke dauraan samaaj ke tamaam kirdaaron se suna
 The journey started from Sankatmochan temple
 
 
 ham sankatmochan mandir ke baahar the
 This is the same temple which was in the news due to serial bomb blast
 suraksha kaa alam ye he ki baahar counter par phone or bag jamaa ho jaataa he, magar bheetar sicurity ek neeli kameez vaali uniform pahane kheni ghiste dumku chachaa numa shaks ke jimme he
 That is, everything is really still Ram and Hanuman trust
 is bare main ek police vaale se poocha, to bole
 Brother Ram Ji baharhaal, ram ji kii kathith tizaarat karne vaali bijepi ke liye ye banaras kii seat sabase khaas ban gai he
 And you can see this by looking at any of the Banaras newspapers
 or ye akhbaar jaruri nahin ki aapane pehle kabhi dekhe sune hon
 These four-page black-and-white newspapers, along with prominent newspapers, are somewhat relaxed nowadays
 wo isliye kyonki inaki lead khabar tay he
 Joshi agreed, Joshi was upset
 aaj hoga modi ke naam kaa elaan
 Announcement of the name postponed till Holi
 matlab ihaan se yaa unha se
 After the scolding, Modi has to rest
 kabhi kabhi vyavdhaan hota he, jab maurya naam kaa koi shooter bear baar lut kar bhaagta he or bich bazaar nae nae bhartee hue police jawan use maar revolver fire dher kar dete hai
 But Banaras is discussing this faring and shoot out only after Modi
 haa, to ham abhi bhi sankatmochan ke baahar hai
 The first one was stumpy and now the young man is on the path of having a few tears
 apni dharmik saamaan kii dukaan ke baahar
 he states
 bhaiya hamaare ghar ke chaar vot hai
 If you fight Joshi, you will not give one
 kuch nahin kiye hai paanch saal main
 And if Modi comes
 denge or muhalla kaa bhi vot dalawaayenge puraa
 And according to these gentlemen 'modi ji will win the election with at least four lakh votes'
 inhone ek or baat pate kii bataai
 Bhaiya, brother, they have been raging with the Sankatmochan and the management committee of all the temples, ever since Modi ji's name is known
 aaj tak koi candidet aayaa ho
 All of them remain Congressmen
 magar ab ye bhi daaen baayen ho rahe hai
 Go to Kanpur Joshi 
 
 main ye sunata hum or agali baar jab diwaar par najar thaharti he to holi kii shubhakamana dete murali manohar joshi najar aate hai
 It is the same Joshi who has heard that once the statement was made that the work of the MP is not to make a drain, but to increase the pride in the Parliament of the area
 desh ke masalon par bahes karnaa he
 Joshi is a learned politician
 or banaras vidwaan to he, magar dambh nahin malang par mar mitata he
 So he asked for my advice without one
 aapse na ho paaegaa
 You must change the seat
 varna 2004 main elahabaad si harakiri ho sakati he
 Go to Kanpur, ride the Modi wave
 agar jite to loksabhaa bhi dikhegi or do baar ke kaabina mantri or jeet kii hetric rach chuke shriprakash jaiswal ko haraane kaa jas bhi milegaa
 
 
 
 to lakaalak sadaken banavaa denge modibanaras lautate hai
 This time Mukhamakham is happening to an associate of Auto
 ham safar par nikle hi the ki paanch sau meter aage auto rukaa or ek sajjan uchakkar driver ke bagal main baith gaye
 Pressing mouth
 dilli hoti to bharpoor dar jate
 Remembering that Aamir Khan auto add
 pataa chalaa ki ye bhi auto vaale hai
 Have to go further
 poocha vot kise doge
 So spoke to Modi
 kyon
 Stayed muskuraae
 Both looked at each other
 kuch salajj se ho gaye
 Have you asked? sakhi piya se preet kyon
 Then said
 bhaiya ye sadaken dekh rahe hai aap
 Is uprooted bura haal ho jaataa he
 In running the tempo
 to modi sadaken banavaa denge kya
 Yes brother, will you get it done? mere sadhu kaa ladkaa he
 Sells Batashe (read Golgappa) in Surat
 bataa rahaa tha ki lakaalak sadaken hoti hai vahaan
 And the lights (lights) keep burning on them throughout the night
 to khub bataashe bikate hai uske
 If you want to save the Ganges, then Modi has to bring it, win it or not fight it
 ye banaras kaa ek bahut bada sach he ki yahaan kii sadaken bahut zyada kharaab hai
 Look where God is lying
 alam ye he ki chauraahey par laal topi vaale homeguard bhi munh par japaniyon kii tarah mask pahanakar khadey hote hai, taaki unki surati main dhura na chali jaae
 And the issue is not just of the road
 vah bhi he, jiskaa banaras raily main bijepi ke maujuuda mahanayake zikr kar gaye
 Of Ganga pollution
 peepe vaale pul se assi ghat tak to pani phir bhi haraa sa kuch dikhataa he
 But then on reaching Rajghat, this Ganga of Kashi starts becoming black
 or yakeen maniye, ye manikarnika yaa harishchandra ghat par jalati chita kii raakh se nahin hi hua he
 If you want to save Banaras, you have to save Ganga
 or ye kaam sirf ek jagah nahin hoga
 Will start from the mountain
 magar chintaa maidan ko zyada kerani padegi
 Because there is too much sewage in this stream of many kinds
 ganga par samaj ko kuch painaa kiya bablu nishad ne
 They said brother, what should we do
 sabko fatafat us paar janaa he
 Then come back and see Dashashwamedh's Aarti
 majabuuran, sari chappu vaali naav hataakar dijal pumping set feet karne pade
 Now the problem is that their livelihood is going on
 magar ganga main lagaataar dhak dhak bhak bhak tel kaa pradooshan bhi tir rahaa he
 Bablu is rightly hurt on the question of votes
 unke mutabik bhaiya fark hamen nahin padataa
 Neither does the ghat wall in front
 bas farak shakal kaa he
 We do not change
 uski har chunaav main badal jaati he
 New new names come
 nai tasveeron ke saath naare put jate hai
 If a politician sitting in Delhi can boast a theory on the basis of this
 par ye vaaki takalifdeh he ki samaaj ke aakhri chor par khadaa aadmi ummid kho chukaa he lagbhag
 Most recent election
 
 
 baharhaal, baat ho rahi thi banaras ke chunaav kii
 Make a break at the outpost and currently the unemployed leader fills more knowledge
 bole, dekho bhaiya modi ji aae to thik he jita denge
 But Ajay Rai is the leader
 nikaal hi diya tha pichhali baar chunaav
 But these khaki ones made Hindu Muslims in the last
 hamen to lagata he ki paisa dekar mukhtaar ko ladvaae yahaan se
 Varna Joshi had gone
 to mitron netaa ji kaa ye kathan samajhane ke liye aaie kuch ateet darshan bhi kar len
 Banaras may have been the city of saints, dissidents and snails
 bhale hi yahaan samaajawaadee, congressi or vampanthi, sabake math saje hon
 But since Ram Lehar, there is lotus feeding
 91 main shrish chandra dikshit saansad bane or uske baad teen dfa 96,98 or 99 main shankar prasad jaiswal
 In 2004 some equations were changed and Congress Dr
 rajesh mishra jeet gaye
 But after 5 years, Benaras became saffron again
 ye usee pichley chunaav kaa haal he
 In 2004, Joshi came to Benares after losing the Allahabad election to Kunwar Revathi Raman Singh of SP
 magar yahaan to bijepi ke lokapriy vidhayak ajay raay daavedaari thonke the
 When Rai was unable to face the high command, he rode on a cycle
 mukaable ke sidhe taur par teen or kul jamaa paanch kone bane
 Ajay Rai handled one front, while Bahubali Mukhtar Ansari, riding on the bsp's elephant, another
 or jaisaa ki pehle zikr kiya gaya he
 Even the tea people of Assi Ghat say that in the end, only Hindu became Muslim
 bataate hai ki isi dhruvikaran se joshi kii laaj bachi
 While defending MP Misir Khet, he fell to the fourth position
 unase kuch chaar sau vot hi kam mili is ilaake main teji se ubhar rahe apana dal ke vijay prakaash jaiswal ko
 Talking about the victory of defeat, Joshi won by about 17 thousand votes
 mukhtaar ne kadi takkar di
 Ajay Rai too stood firm till the end and finished third with 1
25 million votes
 dhruvikaran hi chunaav kaa antim satya he
 
 
 Now the question arises that what is the meaning of spreading this past Purana at the moment
 matlab he
 This may make people like you understand some of the pitches
 pehla yah ki banaras ke rosemara ke jivan main bhale hi aapako sampradayikta kii gandh na dikhe, kyonki dharmik aacharan yahaan kaa saamaanya vyavhaar ban chukaa he
 But polarization is the ultimate truth of elections here
 doosraa, musalmaan or dalit kaa gathjod maarak sabit hota he
 Varna Mukhtar Ansari does not get so many votes only on the basis of bullying
 bhoomiharon or rajputon kii bhi acchhee sankhya he or isi tarah se jaiswal bhi taqatvar hai
 "panditji was a Congressman like every other place, then he was BJP and now he is in power
" matlab vah bhi chatur sujan kii tarah hawa kaa rukh bhaanpane lage hai
 'this Panditji's knowledge was given to us by a government babu outside the famous Keshav's paan shop at Ravidas Gate of BHU
 to alam yah he ki agar modi chunaav ladate hai, to congress kii taraf se do daavedaar hai
 One is Rajesh Mishra, who during his recent visit to Rahul Gandhi hanged a lot of hoardings with his Rahul brother in the city
 duusare hai ajay raay, jo ab saaikal se utar haath majboot kar rahe hai
 But Rai now expresses doubt about Rai being able to repeat the previous performance
 unka kahana he ki joshi halke the
 Modi is weighing
 or ek baat ye bhi he ki ajay raay ke prabhaav kshetra vaala ek bada ilaaka ab machhlishahar sansadeey seat main chalaa gaya he parisemen ke baad
 The third contender is Mukhtar Ansari
 philhal unki patni afasa ansaari ummidavaar hai kaumi ekta dal se
 But Mukhtar announced yesterday that if Modi fought, we are also in the field
 charchaa yah bhi he ki ansaari kii party kaa sapa main vilay kar unhen cycle kii sawari kara di jaaegi
 Speaking of the moment, Kailash Chaurasia is hitting the paddle with Netaji's bicycle
 vaise to vah sapa ke tikat par pados ke mirzapur se vidhayak hai
 But all the business interests of Netaji are in Benaras
 aisa lahakat labara mehfilbaajon ne bataaya
 It was also said that Chaurasia ji will also go
 jaise surendra patel gaye
 These gentlemen were earlier SP candidates from Banaras
 phir kailash aae
 The bsp's candidature has not been revealed yet
 vaise bhi kisi ne khub kaha he
 The BSP has only one candidate
 bahan mayawati
 The rest is dummy
 khayr, ye unki apni raay ho sakati he
 The BSP has a lot of bad guys, but who will fight with Benares, it will be decided by the sister-in-law
 yaa akhilesh yadav ke shabdon main kahen to buaa ji
 The name is run by a Jaiswal ji, who is said to be special of famous liquor businessman Jawahar Jaiswal
 marble kaa vyapaar karte hai or meyar ke chunaav main patkhni kha chuke hai
 
 
 
 to bina jugad ke nahin jeet sakate banaraschalate chalate hamako ek bade akhbaar ke patrkaar ne phone par samajhaayaa
 Look brother, it is not possible in Banaras without muscle and money power
 ab pichhlaa chunaav hi dekh lijie joshi ji kaa
 The reputation of many businessmen was also there
 to sab set kiya gaya
 Now even Narendra Modi will contest this election, he will face Ansari
 matlab muslim varses hindu hi rahegaa maamla
 a Muslim will vote outright only to a Muslim candidate
 or ek baat
 All the candidates who are present now can be air
 modi ke ganit par hi sari ganit set he
 Mulayam Singh has laid all the posts for Modi
 sapa ko bhi dikhaanaa he ki ham rahanuma hai musalamaanon ke
 Therefore, what the parties have introduced can be changed
 ab dekho aap
 Nobody heard the news and the Congress removed Kaif in Phulpur
 is batakahi main ek kshepak or jod lijie
 He told us a contractor who stood on the steering of the car outside Sarnath, but the teacher read the literature
 banaras kii saansadi karnaa raisina hills par centre kii bagdor sanbhaalane se kam mushkil nahin hoga
 The city is stuck between past splendor and imported inputs
 iskaa ek chor satyuga tak jaataa hi he, duusare chor kii pahunch abhi banaras tay nahin kar paaya he
 It is said that who will measure the gossip first, then it will also be seen how far the end has reached
 philhal banaras kimam vaale zarda or magahi pattey ke saath dadh ke neeche paan gulgula rahaa he
 Waiting to see who comes to father-in-law and what to feed
 ye banaras he
 a city made of Bhasma and Aarti
 kabir or tulsi ko ek sur main sadhta shahar
 City of Sand Ganga and Railway Engine Factory
 or ab shaayad modi kaa bhi shahar

 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he) The ICC has asked Team India wicketkeeper Mahendra Singh Dhoni to remove the 'sacrifice badge' mark from his glove
 isisi ke is farmaan se bhartiya cricket phens behad gusse main hai
 Indian cricket fans have come out in support of Dhoni
 pradeshik sena main maanad leftinent karnal rank ke adhikari dhoni world cap main south africa ke khilaaf match main 'balidaan baij' vaala gloves pahanakar utre the
 icc's decree, Dhoni will have to be removed from the glove
 The mark of the honor of the army was praised by the cricket fans with this move of Dhoni
 lekin isisi ko dhoni kaa kadam pasand nahin aayaa
 The ICC called it an exception, saying it was against its rules
 itnaa hi nahin purv bhartiya captain par isisi ke niyamon kaa ulanghan karne par jurmaana bhi lag saktaa he
 Furious with the instructions of the ICC, Indian cricket fans fiercely took out their anger on social media
 kai phens to aise bhi hai jo samajha rahe hai ki kyon dhoni ko bhartiya sena ke prati unke pyaar kaa izhaar karne kii ijaajat milani chahie
 One fan wrote that the sacrificial badge is not associated with any religion, political symbol
 dhoni ko aisa karne kaa puraa haq he
 i see no reason why the ICC has to intervene
 bataa den ki isisi ke niyam ke anusaar koi bhi cricketer dharmik, jaateey or raajnneetik logo kaa istemaal nahin kar saktaa
 Dhoni's love for the Indian Army is not hidden from anyone
 world cap se pehle australia ke khilaaf gharelu siries main bhi team india ke khilaadi sena kii vishesh cap pahanakar maidan main utre the
 Indian players did this in memory of the CRPF soldiers who were martyred in the Pulwama attack
 aisa mana jaataa he ki javaanon ko shradhanjali dene kaa vichaar dhoni ne hi bisisiai ko diya tha
 He provided the cap to fellow players
 tab bhi pakistan cricket board (pisibi)ne iskaa virodh kiya tha or isisi se bharat ke khilaaf karrwai karne kii maang kii thi
 But this demand of PCB was turned down by ICC
 bisisiai ne iske liye pehle hi isisi se khilaadiyon ko vishesh taur par dizin kii gai cap ko pahanane kii ijaajat lee thi

 lekin pareshaani sabase zyaada dukandaaron kii he kyonki unhen sarkaar kii baat bhi manani he or graahakon ko manaanaa bhi he
 Many shops in the heart of Delhi's Connaught Place are in a state of silence these days, since the demonetisation, the general public is forced to pay by debit or credit card
 card pement ke kai phaayde to hai par ab iske nuksaan bhi saamne aane lage he
 Due to the transaction fees being charged by banks during the card transaction and the inconvenience caused by the POS machine at times, people are now shifting from its use
 notebandi ke baad sarkaar lagaataar cashles pement ko badhaava to de rahi he par isse judi sabase badi chintaa tranjaction fees he
 Businessmen as well as customers are also worried about this
 har bank kii taraf se alag alag tranjection fees vasuuli jaati he
 The situation is that the customers now take information about the extra charges incurred before making payment with the card and many times they return without taking the goods
 graahakon kaa kahana he ki pehle unhen cash les tranjection ke liye majaboor kar diya gaya or ab unase manamaane tareeke se tranjection fees lee ja rahi he sarkaar ne notebandi ke baad credit card ke tranjection par 2% kaa shulk nahin lene kaa aadesh diya tha
 Some banks have started charging a re-transaction fee on the use of a credit card for payment, so the common man, already facing inflation, is now shying away for payment with the card
 graahakon se gulzaar rahane vaale bazaaron se raunak kahin kho si gai he, dukandaaron or graahakon ke saath-saath petrol pump maalikon par bhi bainkon ne point of cell(pos) se pement par 1% levi badhaane kaa faisla liya he
 Angry about which the association had decided not to take payment from debit and credit cards, although the government assured the matter, the petrol pump owners have agreed to take payment from the card till January 13
 lekin isi conot place par apana petrol pump chalaane vaale mandeep bhullar ye maanatein he ki card pement par agar unase 1% levi lee jaati he to unakon baari nuksaan uthaanaa padegaa
 What is MDR? MDR means merchant discount rate, whenever a person buys an item from a shop and pays through the card on the POS machine, the shopkeeper gets charged
 notebandi kii ghoshnaa kiye jane ke baad se sarkaar nakad rahit bhugtan ko badhaava de rahi he, yahaan tak ki us dauraan sarkaar ne bainkon ko credit card ke tranjection par 2% kaa shulk nahin lene kaa aadesh diya
 Some banks have started charging transaction fees again for the use of debit cards for payment
 sarkaar or rigerv bank kii ore se koi spasht nirdesh na aane kii vajah se unhone puraani vyavastha behaal kar di he, jiskaa sidhaa asar dukandaaron or aam aadmi par pad rahaa he

 Which you and we will be able to see on the small screen from 16 October
 jhaasa ke barajod ke rahane vaale peshey se kisaan surendra yadav or aarti yadav ke sabase bade bete hai naveen prakaash
 Naveen's primary education was done from Jhajha but Naveen passed the matriculation Kendriya Vidyalaya Jamalpur and Inter examination from DAV, Bokaro
 iske baad naveen prakaash ne hair ajukeshan ke liye dilli kaa rukh kiya
 Naveen Prakash played a leading role in the CSAT movement at UPSC
 iske baad se naveen kii pahchaan ek chaatr netaa ke rup main ban gai
 In this movement, Naveen had told how the new pattern can harm the children studying in the villages and it can become a problem for students who are not very good in English
 naveen ek angreji channel ke bahes main bhaag lene ke baad zyada hi surkhiyaan batori thi
 Naveen Prakash is also very fond of singing and singing besides writing

 Yeddyurappa met the Governor without delay and sought 48 hours to prove his majority
 baharhaal kuch bhi ho, lekin congress or bhaajapa donon ke liye karnataka kii satta jaruri he
 Siddaramaiah tried to create fear within the BJP by running a Dalit card just before the vote
 unhone kaha, agar ham jite to kisi dalit ko mukhyamantri banaaya ja saktaa he
 This will not hurt them
 lingayat ko dharm kaa darja dekar to congress ne pehle hi bhaajapa ko hairaan kar diya tha
 Both Siddaramaiah of Congress and Yeddyurappa of BJP looked fit
 lekin soshal media par donon netaaon ke report card kii baat karen to yediurppa baaji maarthe dikhenge
 In Facebook, Yeddyurappa is ahead and Siddaramaiah is behind Siddaramaiah on Facebook, one lakh eighty four thousand thousand likes and one lakh eighty six thousand eight hundred fifty two
 jabaki yediurppa ke 17 lakh tihattar hajaar aath sau chhattis like or 17 lakh tihattar hajaar chah sau teen folover hai
 On Twitter, the same situation was tweeted by the chief ministerial candidate of Yeddyurappa four hours before writing this news while the last tweet from Siddaramaiah's Twitter handle was done on 8 May
 siddharmaiya ne ab tak kiye ek lakh 68 twit 71 logon ko follow karte hai or 1,59 hajaar log unhen follow karte hai
 Like just 15, Yeddyurappa is also ahead here
 chaar hajaar paanch sau baarah twit kiye ab tak
 Follows one hundred forty six people
 286 hajaar log unhen follow karte hai
 Like 829
 darasal bhaajapa ke netaaon ke soshal media par chust hone kii vajah pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa wo farmaan hai jisamen unhone kaha tha
 Not only is the presence of all leaders on social media necessary but a significant number of followers should be there

 Even in terms of maintaining peace and stability, he was not right
 supreme court ne kaha ki 1989 main ‘bhagwaan shriram lallaa virajman' kii ore se daayar yachika bevakt nahin thi kyonki ayodhya main vivaadit masjid kii maujuudagi ke baavjood unki ‘puja-seva' jari rahi

 peeth ne kaha ki yah tay karte hue ki ram lallaa virajman kii ore se daayar yachika bevakt to nahin thi, hamen ek baat kaa khyaal rakhana hoga ki anya maamalon main ram lallaa ko paksh nahin banaaya gaya tha

 After the formation of the new government in 2014, flagship programs like Make in India, Swachh Bharat, Yoga, Jan Dhan, Antyodaya, Home for All, Digital India, Skill India, Smart City, Stand Up India were launched
 lekin isamen desh main sidhe rojgaar dene ke liye kisi kaarykram kaa jhanda nahin laharaaya gaya
 Was it the government's lapse that today the problem of employment has become the biggest issue facing the country
 2014 main modi sarkaar ke lonch hue kaarykram1
 Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (august 28, 2014): Under this program, the government has tried to make financial inclusion so that all the citizens of the country have to create a bank account and connect it to the financial system
 2
 Digital India (26 August 2014): Under this program, the government is trying to connect the knowledge economy to the last citizen of the country by providing digital facility
 3
 Make in India (25 September 2014): Under this program, there is an effort to make the country globalmanufacturinghub, so that companies from all over the world can come to the country to further the production work

 svachh bharat mishan(2 oktober 2014): is kaarykram ke jariye desh ko 2019 tak open defication (khule main saunch) kii samasya se nijaat dilaanaa he

 is yojana ko saansad nidhi fund se joda gaya he or sabhi saansadon ko 2019 tak 3 gaanv ko adarsh bananaa he
 Therefore, none of the schemes that the Modi government tried to launch at the national level after taking over in May 2014 were directly related to providing employment in the country
 haalanki zyaadaatar yojanaon main nae rojgaar paidaa hone kii ummid jarur he lekin vah tabhi sambhav he jab yah yojanaayen safal hon

 Runki-jhunki's daughter Mangila, padhal-pandavita Damadhe Dinanath, Darshan Dihmin Apan o Dinanath! As soon as Sharada Sinha's voice falls in the ears, wherever the soul is in the streets of Bihar, its village and the river passing through it It touches the edges
 lagata he sab chhodkar pahunch jaaen us ghat par, jahaan gaay kii gobar se lipa hua ek angan hoga
 In the middle of that wrapped courtyard, there will be a red chunari, a changer covered with yellow cloth
 jise dada ji maathe par uthaa badhenge nadi kii taraf
 The bride-to-be is dressed in yellow saris, grandmothers, amma, aunts and aunts will be walking in the sands of vermilion from demand to nose
 un sabase aage rang-birange kapadon main lipte ham bacchon kaa jhund
 Everyone will hurry to reach the ghat and take up the place
 ghat jise banaaya hoga daddiji or ankalji ne mil kar
 Where a banana tree would have been planted, and Alpana would have grown in the afternoon
 lekin har baar lautnaa kahaan sambhav hota he? kahaan mil paati he paradesiyon ko mohalat? man vahiin dur desh baithe-baithe bheengta rahata he yaadon main
 You add days sitting in the room of four by six, then think about those moments and what Amma in the village is doing today? It is hesitation to make a phone call so that it does not get strangled
 pataa na chal jaye ammaa ko bitiyaa udhaas he
 In such a situation, Amma's call comes
 wo khud kii bataane lag jaati hai ki, "aaj nahaay-khaay tha
 Make gourd, gram dal and Arva Chaur rice
 tumhaari yaad aa rahi isiilie kol milaayein hai
 "then you start remembering everything
 kaise nahaay-khaay ke din ammaa asalbhor hi uthakar, snaan kar, pili sari or lahathi pahan, suryadev ko jal arpit karte hue chaar din ke is chhath mahaparv kaa pran karti hai
 Not only Amma, but all the Pawanatins (vratis) in Bihar take a bath after washing the hair on the day of nahai-khay, and take this pledge
 is din ghar main shuddh ghi main lowki kii sabzi, daal or arava chaaval pakaaya jaataa he
 First the Pawanites eat food, then the rest eat it as Prasad
 nahaay-khaay ke agle din hota he 'kharnaa'
 Fasting starts from this day
 is din se vrati ann-jal kaa tyagkar detii hai
 In the evening, put jaggery in cow's milk on new stoves made of soil, kheer and sohari (roti) are made
 phir kele ke pattey par paanch jagah yaa saat jagah nyoj (bhoga) chadhaaya jaataa he
 After which the Vrati distributes the Prasad with her own hands and finally after consuming everyone, herself, taking the Prasad, sleeps on the ground in the same worship room
 aisa mana jaataa he ki mata sita ne jab vanvaas ke dauraan surya dev kii upasna karte hue chhath kiya tha to wo jameen par hi soyin thi isliye vrati ab bhi zamin par hi soti hai
 The next day of Kharna is ‘sanjhiya Arghya’ i
e
 Shamah Arghya
 jisaki shuruyaat subah se ho jaati he
 She gets up at dawn, burns wind and stove and puts it on it, to boil jaggery and water
 phir ghar ke baaki ke log jute jate hai khajuri-thekua banane main
 On the other hand, if the rice flour was mixed in boiling jaggery water, 'kasar' would be tying up, then there is some frying while singing the song of Chhatu
 kaise subah se dopaher ho jaati he pataa bhi nahin chalata
 In the afternoon, the work of decorating the basket and soup starts
 jisamen rakhti hai wo adarak-haldi ke hare-hare paudhe, muuli, paan-supaari, aratak paat (laal rang kaa ek shuddh gol patta jise baad main daravaaje par chipkaaya jaataa he) soot ke dhaage, naarangi rang kaa peepa sindur, seb, santara, kelaa, nariyal, eekh or ghar main bane tamaam pakwaan
 After decorating the basket, they keep it in red baskets, which the family heads carry towards the ghat
 jahaan duubate surya kii puja kii jaati he
 This is another special thing of this festival
 jahaan samoochee duniya main ugte surya kii upasna kii jaati he, vahiin sirf chhath hi aisa tyohaar he jisamen ham duubate hue surya ko puujate hai
 They are offered Arghya
 arghya arpit karne ke liye pavanaitin utarati hai nadi yaa talab main, jahaan wo thodi der pehle khadi ho surya kii upasna karti hai, jise 'thariha' dena kehete hai
 After arghya ascend, all return to their respective homes
 us raat phir angan main 'kosia' bharaa jaataa he
 That is, elephants made of mud among the reed trees and put the clay lamps on top of each one burn the lamp
 diya jalte hi ammaa or chachee log mil subah main surya devtaa jaldi nikle iske liye gane lag jaati hai
 Some songs also sing for Chhathi (shashti) Mata
 manyata he ki bahut samay pehle ek raja hua karte the, jinka naam priyanvad tha
 The king was very majestic but he had no child
 unhone tab santan-prapti yajna kiya
 After which he also got a son but he died after birth
 raja santan shok main itane duhkhi hue ki shmashaan main unhone apane praan bhi tyaag dene kaa nirnay liya
 As soon as the king stepped towards the river to give up his life, at the same time Shashthi Devasena, the daughter of God appeared and asked the king to return home and worship him
 raja ko aashwaasan bhi diya ki raja ko jarur santan kii prapti hogi
 The king returned to the house and wholeheartedly worshiped the goddess
 baad main raja priyanvad ko putr kii prapti hui
 It is said that the king performed this worship on the Shashthi of Kartik Shukla Paksha, hence Chhath is worshiped on this day from that day onwards
 kosia bharne ke baad 'bhor ke arghya' kii taiyaari shuru ho jaati he
 People leave the house towards the ghat around four o'clock
 ghat par pahunch puaal bicha kar suryadev kii ugane kii pratiksha shuru ho jaati he
 Hundreds of lamps flow into the burnt rivers and ponds in the hope that the farther this lamp goes, the more the darkness will be illuminated by it
 diya jaise-jaise aage badhata he vaise-vaise hi andhera chantane lagata he
 The redness starts to increase in the east
 yah aahat hoti he ki surya devtaa ke prakat hone kii
 Now Vrati descends once again in the river and offer morning arghya
 maangati hai tyohaar ke dauraan hue bhul-chook kii maafi
 And with this the faith ends
 lekin abhi soshal media ke is yug main ek varg aisa he jo is tyohaar kii manyataon ko sire se kaarij kar ise sirf pitrusattatmak sabit karne par tula he
 For whom this festival is just a means of destroying the health of women standing in the vermilion and dirty water of the river
 wo nahin samaj sakate hai is tyohaar kii mahatta ko
 They do not know that due to this festival, the ghats of rivers are almost rejuvenated
 chhath ko sirf putr-prapti se jodakar dekhnaa galat he, asal main bharat jaise khetihar desh main yah surya kii upasna kaa vrath he, aakhir surya ke bina kheti kisi? to chhath ke soopon main shaamil prasad kii suchi par nazar daalieh muuli, adarak, haldi, eekh, ankurit chane, mung, dabha neembu, hare nariyal, kele, chaaval ke aate se bane laddu, thekua, mungava aise tamaam prasad hai jo sthaneey utpaadon khaskar usee mausam main kheton se nikle paidaavaar hai or in sabko dene vaale bhagwaan surya ko arpit kiye jate hai
 This festival can also be called Nature's Thanksgiving of agricultural society
 chhath kaa tyohaar diwaali ke baad hota he
 The cleanliness initiated before Diwali is continued by cleaning whatever garbage and garbage is generated after cleaning during Diwali
 mul rup se chhath swatchta pavitrataa kaa tyohaar he
 The worship of the river, the worship of the sun, the cleaning of the ghats of the river, the sinking of the river by the waist and the worship of the rising sun with the coconut and the sun rising is really the worship of nature
 isi pavitrataa ke liye shahro-gaanvon ke galiyon-naaliyon kii jamkar safai hoti he
 There is no mention of any classical legislation in Chhath
 ishwar or upaask ke bich koi bichauliya nahin
 No caste discrimination

 Sharada Sinha is synonymous with songs of Chhath

 Women lead the festival from vernacular to vermilion, in which men work only for logistic providers

 Although the market has now interfered with the festival taking us closer to nature, but as much as it is sacred, and as it is left over from the rest of social and cultural pollution, it seems that it is relevant and important
 ek sher yaad aata he,ugte suraj ko log jal dete hai,jab duubataa he to uthakar chal dete hamper chhath is tathy ko jhuthlaata he
 We also send the smiling sun off with arghya that if Suraj Dev rises tomorrow, we will keep our grace throughout the winter with the sound of winter

 Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu reaches the accident spot where patna-indore express train derailed # kanpurtraintragedypic
 twitter
 com / ic14ucsiqx— ANI UP (@aninewsup)november 20, 2016darasal kanpur ke paas indore patna express patari se nahin utari he, balki patari se utari hai saikado jindagiyaan
 Hundreds of expectations have been derailed and hundreds of future derailed
 patari se wo system utraa he, jo railway ko sarvshereshth banane kii baat karata he or patari se utraa he wo daawa, jisamen bullate train daudane kii baat kii gai lekin yahaan to maamuli train bhi direl ho jaati he
 When more than a hundred people died, the government announced that they would investigate, and punish the culprits to the fullest
 ghatnasthal par pahunche rail mantriis rail haadase se hukumat ko us vakt munh chidhaayaa he jab railway ke vikaas shivi main jiro accident maikenism par sarkari manthan chal rahaa tha
 Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu left for the spot from Surajkund's camp
 ghatnasthal ke baad rail mantri aspataal main jaakar ghayalon se mili
 Suresh Prabhu took stock of the entire incident from the authorities
 unhone kaha ki peediton or ghayalon ko madad pahunchaana unki pehali praathamikta he
 At the same time, the Railway Minister assured that the UP Government will also be talked about the accident
 prabhuji kii rail kaa kiraaya badhata rahaa or apane bajet main wo hameshaa daawa karte rahe ki yatriyon kii suraksha hi unka makasad he
 But where did the security that was left behind in the railway budget of about one and a quarter million rupees, which was repeated repeatedly
 railway kaa 2016-17 kaa anumaanit bajet ek lakh 21 hajaar karod kaa he, jisamen pichley bajet kii tulana main 21 fisadi kaa ijapha hua he
 There is a provision of Rs 2661 crore in the budget on the safety of railways
 inamen 60 fisadi rakam patariyon ke navinikaran or rakrakhaav par kharch hoti he jabaki 25 fisadi rakam durghatnarokee upkarnon par
 Nevertheless, the railway continues to distribute death on its broken tracks and the government has nothing but condolences
 pradhanmantri ne suresh prabhu ko rail mantri banaaya tha ki wo rail ko kamai or suraksha kii patari par le aaenge lekin prabhu ke raaj main railway par kai sawaal uthaa rahaa he
 1
 pukhraya main rail trek main tut thi to iskaa pataa pehle kyon nahin chalaa?2
 If there was a crack in the track, why was the decision to run the train taken? 3
 kiraaya to bad jaataa he lekin safar main suraksha kii guarantee kyon nahin leti sarkaar?4
 How long will concrete plans be made on bridges and tracks? 5
 aakhir railway main suraksha shrenee main 86 hajaar se zyada post khaali kyon pade hai?6
 Will a bullet train run on the track of similar misconceptions? In recent years, there was not such a big railway accident
 kanpur ke purakhaaya main jo kuch hua, uske baad vahaan afratfari kaa aisa alam he ki log apano ko dhundh bhi nahin paa rahe
 Some are running in the hospital and some in the post mortem house
 bas yahi ummid ki jin apano ko talash rahe hai, wo sahi salaamat mil jaaen
 The picture of the bogies of patna-indore Express in Pukhraya, Kanpur is telling how painful people have gone through
 ham aapako bataate hai ki kaise itnaa bada haadasa hua ki ek jatke main sau se zyada jindagiyaan maut main villin ho gayi
 Time: 3:10 PM train apni puri raftaar main thi or bogiyaan ek duusare se takaraati hui jameen par gir rahi thi
 It was that time of dawn, when sleep is at its peak, people were in deep sleep
 kuch kii ankhen to is haadase main usee vakt hameshaa ke liye band ho gayi
 For those whose eyes were opened, the front view was much worse, more than a frightful dream
 ek baar jab rescue oparation shuru hua to bhayaavah tasviren saamne aane lageen
 Mati post-mortem house of Kanpur countryside became one of the most dreadful railway accidents in India
 karmchaariyon ko samaj nahin aa rahaa ki register main badhati ginati kaa kya karen or apano ko dhundne vaale logon ko kaise samajhaayen
 Seeing the people moaning on the bed of the hospital about the system, your heart will be forced to ask the question, how long will the railway, which is considered the lifeline of India, continue to die
 isi train main monu vishwakarma the, jinaki jindagi ravivaar subah teen baje ke kareeb yun badali ki ab train main chadhane se pehle ye hajaar baar sochenge
 Mohammad Munajir also left for Patna on this train, there was a good business going on in Indore
 jindagi maje se patari par daud rahi thi, pehle notebandi kii maar padi or boria bistar baandhna pad gaya
 Before the journey from Indore to Patna was half completed, life became the victim of another accident
 aisi kai kahaniyaan indore, kanpur se lekar patna tak sunai pad rahi hai
 If any of the entire family traveling in the train survived, then someone went to death
 kuch kii laash mili to kuch ke bare main ye bhi nahin pataa ki saansen chal rahi hai yaa band hai
 Hundreds of families are waiting for the bad news
 apano kii talash main bhatakate logek haadasa kitnon kii jindagi tabah kar jaataa he, isaki baangi patna se 21 logon kaa ek dal tirthaton par shiridy or indore gaya tha, shanivaar ko isi train se ghar vaapasi thi
 a family in that team will make you feel their mental state
 isi train se patna kaa hi ek or parivaar ghar laut rahaa tha, pita salaamat hai, lekin maa kii koi khabar nahin he
 At Patna station, there is a fear and fear
 yahaan gopal prasad apane laapata rishtedaaron kii khoj khabar lene pahunche
 Seven family members were coming to Patna by this train
 kaaphi chaanbin ke baad pataa chalaa ki teen log aspataal main bhartee hai lekin baaki kaa pataa nahin
 The search is not just for the loved ones, but also for the system that distributes death, the system which loosens your pockets in the name of railway safety but to repair broken tracks, cracked bridges and decaying railways
 The name has a loose-mouthed attitude, the result is in front of you
 purakhaaya kaa rail haadasa system ke saamne sabase bada sawaal he
 Today's accident has proved the safety cycle of the railway is very weak
 haadase ruuk nahin rahe, sarkaar aati he, nae rail mantri aate hai lekin haadase apni hi raftaar main hote rahete hai
 Factories that will make it easier for you to understand how lazy you are to implement the railway safety arrangements that wish you a happy journey

 According to the millions of posts in the Railways, the vision of the Ministry of Railways is not clear

 At the same time, two thousand gangman posts in the NCR division are vacant
 rail suraksha se judi kakodakar samiti kii report ko abhi lagu karnaa baaki he
 Also, one and a half lakh crore rupees are needed for rescue and security in the railways, but no steps have been taken in this direction

 chachaa-bhattije ke bich kya kadavaahat kam hogishivpal yadav kya sapa main phir karenge vaapasiloksabhaa chunaav se pehle shivpal ne banaai partismajawaadee party ke rashtriya adhyaksh akhilesh yadav ke tevar apane chachaa or pragatisheel samaajawaadee party ke adhyaksh shivpal yadav par naram pad gaye hai
 On Shivpal's return, Akhilesh said on Friday that anyone who wants to come will close his eyes and join the party

 There is democracy in our family, not familism

 Shivpal while talking to reporters in Mainpuri said that there is full scope of reconciliation from his side

 One by one, the SP leaders are leaving
 pichley dinon kai rajyasabha sadasyon ne sapa kaa saath chhodkar bijepi kaa daaman tham liya he
 In such a situation, Akhilesh is again trying to strengthen the party
 yahi vajah he ki akhilesh or shivpal ke bich jami kadavaahat kii barf ke pighalati najar aa rahi he
 Let us tell that before the 2017 Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections, there was a war of supremacy in Mulayam clan
 iske baad akhilesh yadav ne samaajawaadee party par apana ecchhatra raaj kaayam kar liya tha
 There was a deep gap between Akhilesh Yadav and Shivpal Yadav
 haalanki mulaayam singh yadav sahit party ke varisht netaaon ne donon netaaon ke bich sulah kii kai koshishen kin, lekin safalataa nahin mili
 In such a situation, just before the Lok Sabha elections, Shivpal Yadav formed the Samajwadi Front with his supporters and then after a few days he turned his front into Progressive Samajwadi Party (lohia)
 aise main abhi sapa netaa ramgovind choudhary ne shivpal yadav kii vidhansabha kii sadsyta radd karne kii yachika daal di thi
 So will Shivpal Yadav return to the Samajwadi Party on Akhilesh's offer? This statement of Akhilesh Yadav has a big meaning
 pichley dinon shivpal yadav ne elaan kar diya he ki ab vah jaswantnagar se apni party pragatisheel samaajawaadee party ke chunaav chinh par chunaav ladenge
 On the other hand, a few days ago, Samajwadi Party petitioned Shivpal Yadav to cancel his membership in the assembly
 ek taraf shivpal yadav akele ladane ko taiyaar hai
 On the other hand, Akhilesh Yadav has given a petition to end the membership and in the meantime, the gesture of Akhilesh Yadav to return home is very important
 philhal shivpal yadav kii taraf se is par koi pratikriya nahin ai he

 The controversy of Bihar Congress has been going on for the last 2 days at the rate of Rahul Gandhi
 sutron ke mutabik rahul gandhi se baatcheet main vidhayakon ne congress party ke bhavishya kii behatari kii baaten rakhin
 Also told their road map but during this meeting some mlas asked to walk alone and leave Lalu Prasad's company
 isi baat par congress main bavaal bad gaya
 Some mlas who went to meet Rahul Gandhi talked about staying with the Congress and not going with Lalu
 is virodh se aise sawaal khadey ho gaye ki aakhir lalu prasad yadav se naaraazgi kii baat kahaan se aa gai
 In the last one week, the high command has monitored and banned two-thirds of the 18 mlas, ie, not forming a separate faction of 18
 18 vidhayak tuutane kii sthiti main unhen manyata bhi mil jaaegi orparty kii fajeehatbhi hogi
 In such a situation, Ghulam Nabi Azad and Ahmed Patel continued such efforts that two-thirds of the mlas should not break
 is bich aise sawaal uthe ki aakhir bihar pradesh congress main lalu virodh ke naam par chalaae jane vaale hastakshar abhiyaan ke kya myne hai? is puri kavayad ke peeche koun he or ise kyon anjaam diya gaya
 According to sources close to the high command, three occasions came that the Congress had to look united against Nitish
 pehla mauka raashtrapati chunaav main aayaa tab pradesh adhyaksh ashok choudhary ne sabhi 27 congressi vidhayakon ko nitish se alag mira kumaar ke haq main matdaan karavaaya
 The second chance came in the Vice Presidential election when Nitish had left the Congress but even then all the 27 mlas were in favor of Gopal Krishna Gandhi against Nitish
 bada mauka tab tha jab nitish kii mukhyamantri kii kursi par matdaan hua
 All Congress mlas along with Lalu's RJD voted against Nitish
 yah sab hone ke baad congress alaakaman ne tay kar liya ki ab bhavishya main maukey ke hisaab se lalu ke saath gathbandhan karnaa hoga
 Everything was going well but suddenly there was news that there was a signature campaign in Bihar Pradesh Congress
 isamen congress ke saath lalu ke durvyavhaar kaa zikr he
 In such a situation, the Congress high command should decide
 baat badi sidhi thi ki congress lalu ke saath ja chuki thi
 Nitish had joined hands with BJP
 aise main lalu ke khilaaf hastakshar abhiyaan chalaanaa kya kahata he? kya congress ko bijepi kii god main ja baithe nitish kumaar ke saath janaa chahie
 It was an attempt to break the Congress! If sources are to be believed, the attempt was to break two-thirds, ie 18 mlas
 maamla 13-14 tak pahunch bhi gaya tha
 Meanwhile, the matter spread
 saare samikarnon or sabooton ke maddenjar congress alaakaman ne faisla kiya ki 4 saal se pradesh adhyaksh or nitish sarkaar main mantri rahe nitish ke kareebi ashok choudhary ko janaa hoga
 There were such things to hear, there are organizational elections within the Congress
 rahul gandhi ko adhyaksh bananaa he
 Under that process, the president of Bihar Pradesh Congress should be replaced in the next one and a half months
 baat yah bhi hui ki unke 4 saal kaa kaarykaal bhi puraa ho gaya he
 In the meantime, such questions also arose that when the state president Ashok Chaudhary would remain and the organization elections would be held in Mendihar state, Ashok Chaudhary would make many of his people become district presidents
 aise main agar bhavishya main ashok choudhary ne congress se dagaa kiya to unke niyukt kiye gaye kai jiladhyaksh congress ko jhatka de sakate hai
 In such a situation, the party has decided to remove him from this post at the earliest
 aise bhi sawaal uthe ki ashok choudhary bhale hi aaj argedy or lalu virodh kii baat kar rahe hon magar ve bhul gaye ki congress ke chaar vidhayak hone par ve argedy kii madad se hi emelsi bane the
 The party has also contested the Lok Sabha elections before or after the assembly elections
 yahi vajah rahi ki congress main vivaad bad gaya he
 Even if the Congress mlas do not break up, because of Lalu's opposition, not everything is visible in the party

 ) The last over of the sixth match of the Nidahas T20 tri-series between Bangladesh and hosts Sri Lanka saw a lot of drama
 donon tiimon ke khilaadi taish main aa gaye or laga ki match puraa nahin hoga
 However the match took place and Bangladesh defeated Sri Lanka in this thrilling match
 160 ranon ke lakshya kaa peechha kar rahi bangladesh team ko aakhri over main jeet ke liye 12 ran kii jarurat thi
 This was the time when the whole drama started
 srilanka kii ore se ishuru udaana ke is over main pehle do gendon bangladesh ke ballebaaj koi ran nahin bana sake
 At the same time, Bangladesh captain shakib-al-hasan got annoyed after falling wickets as 2 bouncers and run out on the second ball
 shaakib ne match rukvaa diya or apni team ko waapas bulaane kii koshish kii
 Shakib felt that the umpire had pointed to Noble on the second ball
 maamla sulajhane par match shuru hone ke baad bangladesh ke mohammadullah ne shandaar ballebaaji kii
 The Bangladeshi batsman hit the third ball, then took 2 runs and won the match by hitting a six off the 5th ball of the last over
 match khatm hone par shaakib ne kaha ki kabhi kabhi imoshan aap par haaavee ho jate hai, haalanki unhen captain rahete hue is par dhyaan dena chahie
 Batting first after losing the toss in this match played at r Premadasa Stadium in Colombo, the Sri Lankan team lost 15 wickets in 20 overs to score 159 runs and set a target of 160 runs to win in front of Bangladesh
 kusal perera ne 61 or tisara perera ne 58 ran kii pari kheli
 On the controversy in the match, Tamim said that it was a very emotional match
 unke anusaar un logon ne ampire ko no ball ishaara dete hue dekha tha
 So they complained
 isi vajah se itnaa drama hua
 However, assuming the mistake, Tamim Iqbal said that they should have behaved properly
 haalanki ab vivaad khatm ho chukaa he
 Earlier, Tamim Iqbal's innings of fifty gave Bangladesh a strong start
 uske baad mohammadullah ne naabad 43 ran banaakar team ko jeet dilaa di
 Bangladesh chose the first bowling before Bangladesh captain Shakib al-hasan decided to bowl by winning the toss against Sri Lanka and invited the hosts to bat first
 shaakib chot ke kaaran pichley maichon main nahin khel sake the, lekin is match main unhone captain ke taur par vaapasi kii
 a good thing for Shakibbabland, who returned to the Bangladesh team, is that his regular captain and all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan is returning after an injury
 shaakib is siries ke pehle teen maichon main team main nahin the, lekin guuruuvaar ko bangladesh cricket board (bisibi) ne is baat kii jaankaree di he ki shaakib chot se thik hokar is match main team kii captaini karenge
 Apart from this, Bangladesh will get a mental edge in this match
 is siries main in donon tiimon ke bich hue pichley match main bangladesh ne record jeet hasil kii thi
 Sri Lanka set a target of 215 runs in front of Bangladesh in that match, which Bangladesh achieved in the unbeaten innings played by Mushfiqur Rahim with the help of five fours and four sixes in 35 balls
 is match main shaakib ke aane se team ko gendbaaji or ballebaaji donon main majbootee milegi, lekin yah dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki vah kis kii jagah maidan par utarate hai
 Apart from these two, Daromdar will be in the batting against Tamim Iqbal, Mushfiqur Rahim and Mahmudullah
 gendbaaji main mustafijur rahamaan, rubell hossain par srilankai ballebaajon ko rokane kii badi jimmedaari he
 Talking of Sri Lankan Sri Lanka, the batting revolves around Kusal Mendis, Kusal Perera and captain Dinesh Chandimal
 bangladesh ke khilaaf khele gaye match main perera ne 48 gendon main aath chauke or do chhakkon kii madad se 74 ranon kii pari kheli thi
 Mendis also scored 57 runs in that match
 srilanka ko dinesh chandimal kii kami bhi khalegi jinhen do tii-20 maichon se nilambit kar diya gaya he
 Bowling has been a weak link for Sri Lanka, although spinner Aquila Dhananjay has impressed but he is not getting continuous support from the other end

 australia ke khilaaf chaar divasiy mukaable main viraat kohli kuch khaas nahin kar paae
 16 in the first innings and 45 in the second innings of the unofficial Test played in Chennai did not save the team's defeat
 is mukaable ke baad kohli kii nazren aagaamee srilankai daure par tik gai hai
 He made it clear in an interview given to 'bcci

 viraat ke mutabik team yuva jarur he, lekin team main damakham kii koi kami nahin he
 He said, 'this is the first major series as a captain
 bangladesh ke khilaaf ek hi test match tha
 This is the new challenge

 ' kohli ke liye test captain ke taur par yah pehali badi siries he
 He is still waiting for his first win as a Test captain
 unhen is baat kaa bhi bakhubi ahsaas he ki jeet hasil karne ke liye unhen balle se bhi dhamal dikhaanaa hoga
 He said in Chennai, 'I always take my batting seriously, because i always want to win
 main jab bhi ballebaaji karne jaataa hum, hameshaa shat-pratishat dene kii koshish karata hum
 Comments srilankai paristhitiyon main spinneron kii bhoomika sabase ahm hogi

 The real politics is now beginning after throwing the initial power in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections
 diwaali ke baad upi main bade siyaasi dhamaakon kii taiyaari he
 In fact, the Congress feels that the stakes of making Sheila Dixit the face of CM in UP are not doing well
 bispi, congress se sammanjanak siton ke saath talmail karne ko taiyaar ho nahin rahi, isliye congress ke netaaon kaa bada tabaka alaakaman se ab jediu, areldi samet choti partiyon ke saath samaajawaadee party se gathjod karke bijepi ko upi main rokane kii vakaalat kar rahaa he
 Laying of pieces has also been started in political chess
 akhilesh upi sarkarmen manmutabik faisle le rahe hai or jediu ke sharad yadav sonia se mulaakaat kar rahe hai
 Honorable seats and Nitish formula can be discussed, the final decision will be taken in November
 naam na chhapane kii shart par congress or sapa ke netaa kehete hai ki akhilesh-rahul or priyanka-dimple kii jodi jab maidan main utregi to tahalaka to machega hi
 Along with this, the image of Nitish Kumar in Purvanchal will be benefited, Kurmi vote bank will also benefit
 vahiin ajit singh or jayant pashchimi upi main phayda denge
 Overall, alliances will emerge as a challenge before the BJP and will provide a place to the anti-bjp vote, as well as the Muslim vote will remain united
 ye he rahul ko manaane kaa formuladansal, rahul gandhi khud mulaayam singh yadav or ajit singh ke saath usee tarj par nahin dikhnaa chaahate, jis tarah bihar main lalu yadav se unako parhez tha
 In such a situation, the formula has been suggested to Rahul that like Nitish in Bihar, the CM face in UP will be Akhilesh, the rest will be in support, what would you mind with that
 aap bihar kii tarj par akhilesh ke chehre par bijepi virodh kii dhuree banie or 2019 main bijepi virodh kaa rashtriya cheharaa banie
 On the other hand, Akhilesh has also tried to convey the message from his recent working style that now he will run the government according to his own, not under any pressure
 shivpal or baaki mantriyon ko waapas naa lekar akhilesh ne kadaa sandesh to de hi diya he
 If the Congress sources are being forced to form alliances in UP, then after initial campaigning, Congress leaders feel that the vote percentage of the Congress may increase
 lekin siten bahut zyaada nahin bad paa raheen
 In such a situation, when the BJP is keeping pace with its party and smaller parties, in order to stop it in UP, the Congress will also have to compete with the alliance
 congress ko lagata he ki, upi main congress kii jeet se zyaada jaruri bijepi kii haar he
 Anyway, the Congress is eyeing Modi in 2019
 aise main talmail ke liye uski pehali pasand to bispi he, lekin wo gathjod ke liye taiyaar nahin he
 Therefore, a fresh conversation has started on Bihar's Nitish formula
 uttar pradesh main nai ibaarat likhe jane kii shuruyaat to ho chuki he, lekin siton kii sankhya, netaaon kii vyaktigat mahatvakanksha or sammaan kii ladaai jaise tamaam mudde hai jo sulajhe rahenge tabhi baat aage badhegi
 Therefore, the month of November is very important in UP in terms of political multiplication
 par khyaal rahe, sab tay ho jaye, ghoshnaa ho jaye, tabhi maniye ki bihar kaa nitish formula upi main bhi lagu kiya ja rahaa he
 Because, now there are many obstacles in the way and there is a clan of Pandora, which needs to be added

 What would be more glorious for Hindustan is that Sachin himself has grown older than Don in Don Bradman's house
 test cricket kaa itihaas apane in do sitaron ke bich apana safar tay karata he
 When Bradman put Test cricket on his feet, Sachin taught him to run
 donon apni- apni khaasiyat or record se us mukaam par khadey hai, jahaan gaahe-bagaahe dono main tulana hone lagati he
 The new research itself came from Don Bradman's country Australia, in which it was found that players bigger than Don are master blasters

 This study has been done with all the big players of their time
 research kaa formula is tarah he ki khilaadi ke kul kariyar ran main se uske saath ke ausat khilaadi ke utane hi maichon main kariyar ran ko ghataakar dekha jaae
 For example, Sachin Tendulkar has scored 15183 runs in 184 Tests, then it was seen that if other players had the opportunity to play 184 Tests, then how many runs would they have scored according to their average

 Justice Ajit Bharihok heard the arguments of senior lawyer Ram Jethmalani on behalf of Chandra on Friday
 adaalat ne hridayrog se peedit pipaara ko unki pasand ke ek nijee aspataal main ilaaj karaane kii anumati bhi di, kyonki akhil bhartiya ayurvigyaan santhaan (ames) main unki vibhinn prakaar kii jaanch ke liye paryaapt upkaran uplabdh nahin hai
 Jethmalani said his client Chandra has been unnecessarily arrested
 varisht vakil ne kaha ki nichali adaalat ko yah nyaayadhikaar nahin he ki vah mere muvakkil ko jail main rakhe, kyonki kanoon ke ek achche jaankaar naagarik ke rup main notice milane ke baad vah adaalat ke samaksh pesh hua tha
 Jethmalani said that his client has been wrongly detained which does not come under the jurisdiction of the lower court
 unhone kaha ki unke muvakkil ne telecom license or spectrum ke liye aavedan kiya tha, kyonki unka udyog teji se bad rahaa tha or isliye bhi ki niamak ne saarvajanik rup se kaha tha ki kisi bhi udyog se koi bhi in chizon ke liye aavedan kar saktaa he
 The senior counsel also said that his client has the right to remain free
 unhone adaalat se kaha ki unhen swatantra hokar apana mukadmaa ladane kii anumati di jaae

 jo haal aspataal kaa he vahi adaalat kaa he
 You must have seen in a hospital that there is a lot of crowd in front of the doctor's chamber
 ho saktaa he ki doctor sahab kaaphi achche hon, magar kahin aisa to nahin ki doctor hi kam he, jiske kaaran un par itnaa dabaav he
 According to the Indian Medical Association, 50,000 doctors are needed for critical care in India, so that there is no shortage of doctors in the event of death, but there are only 8350 doctors in India
 kya 50,000 doctoron kii kami ye 8350 doctor puri kar sakate hai
 So your life did not depend on Ram vishwa swasthya sanghathan ke anusaar 1000 marijon par ek doctor he
 According to this, there should be 10 doctors in 10,000 but there are 7 doctors in India
 brazil or china main 10,000 par 180 doctor hai
 This is why you have been hearing for many years that the date of operation in such and such government hospital is found after six months to one year
 jiske paas paisa he or aaj kal beemaa he use lagata he ki vah chand minute main doctor haazir kar legaa, lekin aap privet aspataalon main bhi jaakar dekhiye kya haal he
 What a rush there is
 sitambar 2015 main kendriya swasthya mantri ne neshnal health profile jari kii thi jiske anusaar har sarkari aspataal kam se kam 61,000 marizon kaa ilaaj karata he
 There are one bed for 1833 people and each government doctor treats 11,000 people
 ham duniya ke kai garib deshon se bhi kam paisa swasthya par karch karte hai
 If you go to any court, you will feel that you have come to the hospital
 10 lakh kii aabaadi par bharat main jajon kii sankhya mushkil se 15 he
 The judges are so burdened with lawsuits that it takes 20-30 years before the decision comes
 na ilaaj time paras na insaaf time par
 One jumla of the judiciary's world has been so weakened that it has no meaning
 aap jaanate bhi hai
 Justice Delayed Justice Denied
 insaaf main deree ninsaafi he
 When you are so knowledgeable, then who should be punished for that injustice
 insaaf maangane vaale ko di jaae yaa dene vaale ko di jaae
 Many Chief Justices have already mentioned the shortage of judges in India
 2003 main jaipur main lok adaalaton ke sammelan main bolte hue tab ke bharat ke chif justise ve en khare ne kaha tha, adaalaton main backlog kaaphi lanbaa hota ja rahaa he
 Infrastructure is very weak
 jajon kii sankhya kam he
 There are 135 judges in the US with a population of 1 million, in India there are 13 judges on a population of 1 million
 swasthy loktantr ke liye majboot nyaaypalika bahut zaruri he
 Someone must have said before 2003 but 2016 has come
 aapako lagata he ki bich ke pradhan nyaayadhish is masale ko bhul gaye honge
 In 2004, the then Chief Justice of India, Justice RC Lahoti, held that the lack of judges had been blamed for the pending cases
 tribune kii report ke anusaar justise lahoti ne hai court ke mukhya nyayadhishon se kaha tha ki wo nichali adaalaton par nazar rakhen taaki mukademon kii sunwaayee samay se hoti rahe
 You must be thinking that in 2003, 2004, the Chief Justice would have talked about the shortage of judges, then the governments must have come into action
 paanch saal baad 2009 main chif justise ke ji balakrishnan ne 26 nanvabar ko rashtriya kanoon diwas ke maukey par kaha tha ki 2008 main 1
 8 crore new case files were filed, which shows how much confidence people have in the judiciary
 14,000 jajon ne 1 karod 70 lakh mukademon ko nipta bhi diya tha
 Meaning a judge handles 1200 cases in a year
 jajon kii kami or buniyadi dhaanchon kii kami ke baad bhi yah kaam karke dikhaaya gaya he
 In 2008, 40 million cases were heard in Indian courts
 yah aankada duniya ke kisi bhi desh kii adaalat se kai guna zyada he
 This is why it takes many years to complete the trial of the cases
 justise balakrishnan ne kaha tha ki jajon kii itani kami he ki ek jaj ko ek cese par nazar daalane ke liye 25 minute se zyaada nahin milte
 Don't you fear doctor ke paas line
 Line near the judge
 builder ke paas bhi line
 There too, people are facing delays of four years in getting flats
 25 minute ek cese ke liye
 The judge must be working faster than a computer
 yah sab sochate-vichaarte 2016 aa gaya
 Sunday was the day and the opportunity was in the Annual Chief Minister and Chief Justice Conference that the current Chief Justice of India repeats what his former Chief Justice has said
 unhone angrezi main jo kuch kaha, uskaa hindi anuwaad kuch is tarah he- bharat main jajon kii sankhya 7675 se badhaakar 40,357 karne kii zarurat he
 The number of judges should increase from 10 to 50 on a population of one million
 1987 main lau kamishan ne desh main 40,000 hazaar jajon kaa suzav diya tha
 But nothing happened
 2002 main pranab mukherjee ke netritv main sansad kii sthaayee samiti ne bhi kaha tha ki jajon kii sankhya bahut kam he
 There are only ten judges in India with a population of one million
 sthaayee samiti ne suzav diya ki ise 10 se 50 kiya jaae
 The appointment of 50 judges on 10 lakhs makes the number of judges in the country to 40,000
 lekin kuch nahin hua
 On 21 February 2013, Chief Justice Altamas Kabir wrote to the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh but nothing happened
 chif justise tii es thakur nyaaypalika ke har str par jajon kii kami ko lekar bhavuk nahin the
 Were aggressive
 kehete ja rahe the ki hamane har str par charchaa kii he ki nichali adaalaton main jajon kii sankhya badhaai jaani chahie
 The number of judges in the High Court should be increased
 hamane is par charchaa kii or sahamat hue ki subah or shaam kii adaalaton ko shuru karnaa hoga or iske liye sevanivrutt jajon kii madad lee jaae
 Something special will have to be done for under trial in jails for 10 years
 hamane har str par charchaa kii he or sahamat hue hai ki nichali adaalaton or hai court main koi bhi cese paanch saal se zyada purana na ho
 They were going to say that we have discussed for this matter, for that matter
 sahamat hote rahe hai
 They have also discussed that they will use all the grants received under the 14th Finance Commission
 main jaanata hum ki aap vakil nahin hai lekin is desh ke pradhanmantri ke rup main aap jaanate honge ki 1950 main supreme court kii shuruuaat 8 jajon se hui thi
 Then there were only 1215 cases
 hamane ek jaj par 100 mukademon se apni shuruyaat kii thi
 Within a decade, the number of judges increased to 14 and the cases were 3247
 1986 main supreme court main 26 jaj ho gaye or cese kii sankhya ho gai 27,881
 At present, our capacity is 31 and the number of cases is 77,151 till 2014, the number of cases pending against 31 judges was 81,583 which we have reduced to 60,260
 chif justise ne is maukey kaa acha istemaal kiya taaki logon kaa dhyaan jajon kii kami par jaae
 He also told how the number of pending cases has decreased even after the shortage of judges in the Supreme Court
 unhone kaha ki adaalaton main mukademon kii sankhya badhati ja rahi he
 Today 38 lakh 68 thousand cases are pending in the High Court
 434 jajon kii vekency bhari jaani chahie
 Chief Justice said, 'he used to ask the question that if a road is constructed by 5 men in 10 days, if the same road is to be built in a day then how many people are needed
 or uttar hota tha, 50 aadmi chahie
 3868000 How many men are needed to settle the case
 kitne jaj chahie
 Why don't we understand this? ' paanchavin paas ko samajhane ke andaaz main unhone samajha to diya lekin kisi kaa dhyaan us aadmi kii taraf nahin gaya jise jajon kii kami kaa shikaar hona hota he
 Various high profile conferences are held around the country on judiciary issues
 jisamen kabhi mukhyamantri to kabhi pradhanmantri to kabhi chif justise jate rahete hai
 Such a thing is being said in every conference but it has been said for a decade and a half, yet there are not enough reforms
 isi march maheene main khud pradhanmantri ne patna hoicourt kii sthapana ke shatabdi samaaroh main lambit mukademon ko lekar chintaa jaahir kii thi
 In Patna, the Prime Minister said that i have a suggestion, and this idea has just come to me that our courts should bring a bulletin every year highlighting the oldest cases
 kuch chalis saal ke bhi ho sakate hai kuch 50 saal ke bhi ho sakate hai
 This will create a sensibility among the people as to how many cases are pending
 isse ek maahaul banegaa ki kaise in baaki mukademon kaa hal nikaala jaae
 The atmosphere has been created for decades pending information on pending cases
 aae din akhabaaron main report aati he
 Discussions are held in conferences
 sawaal he jajon kii niyukti yaa sankhya badhegi yaa nahin yaa sirf samvedansheeltaa yaa jaagarukta se isamen sudhaar aa jayega
 According to the report of 26 October 2009 Hindu newspaper, then Law Minister Veerappa Moily had said that all the pending cases will be put on the National Grid on 30 November 2009
 neshnal greed par lambit mukademon kaa puraa aankada he
 If you search by the name of NJDG, National Judicial Data Grid, then a page will open on which you will get the list of all the cases till date
 hamane somvaar shaam tak kaa data dekha to There are 22 lakh 58 thousand 441 pending cases in India over 10 years
 5 se 10 saal ke bich main lambit mukademon kii sankhya he 38 lakh, 28 hazaar 117
 It is obvious that we are available to know about the pending cases
 neshnal data greed ke alaava i court kii site par jaakar aap puure desh kii tamaam adaalaton ke mukademon kii sthiti on line dekh sakate hai
 National grid or e-court is for information, but whether these facilities can fill the shortage of judges
 chif justise ne saaf-saaf kaha ki upaay yahi he ki jajon kii sankhya badhaai jaae
 It did not take two months to approve the names we have sent
 koi aapatti he to sidhe hamase baat kii jaae kyonki jajon ko niyukt karne vaali colegium ne lambii prakriya ke tahat naamon ko final kiya he
 In 2010, the Center had decided that a National Litigation Policy would be brought under which states were to reduce the number of their government lawsuits, but according to the final notice of 2015, the cabinet is considering it
 march main hi elahabaad court kii 150veen jayanti ke maukey par raashtrapati pranab mukherjee ne kaha tha ki insaaf main deree ninsaphi he
 The number of judges should be increased and vacant posts should be filled quickly
 ham jaananaa chaahate the ki jaj vaaki kitna kaam karte hai
 Our colleague Ashish Bhargava found out at his level how much work a Supreme Court judge has to do
 kaash ki ham kisi jaj kii puri dincharya camere se shoot karte or aapako dikhaa pate
 i could not believe hearing that the judge could not do any work other than work
 saans kaise lete honge iske liye kisi ko janhit yachika daayar kerani chahie
 Ashish told that a judge has to work for 18 hours daily
 subah das se shaam chaar baje tak court main rahete hai
 After this, go home and rest for one and a half hours
 phir agle din ke mukademon kii taiyaari main lag jate hai
 Every lawsuit has to be seen on file
 koi file 100 pej kii hoti he to koi pachaas pej kii
 Decision between this also has to be dictated
 saadhe gyaarah baje tak sone jate hai or paanch baje uth jate hai
 The judges love walking
 tahalne ke baad subah saat se saadhe aath baje tak phir cese kii taiyaari karte hai
 He leaves for court around half past nine
 kai jaj shanivaar or ravivaar ke din bhi der raat tak kaam karte hai
 In addition to filing cases, listening to the cases filed, writing judgments, they also have other administrative functions
 unki puri kshamta is baat par aanki jaati he ki kitni tezi se ve cese ko sun lete hai, samaj lete hai or faisla dete hai
 The promotion of judges of lower courts depends on how many cases have been dealt
 kya koi jaj ek din main 50 file pard saktaa he
 Judges work from seven in the morning to 11 in the night, then on the day of the holiday
 to kya yah thik he ki unki chuttee par nazar daali jaae
 Chief Justice TS Thakur said that we do not just go to Manali
 jo sanvaidhanik peeth ke jaj hote hai wo apane faisle likh rahe hote hai
 If one side is ready then the other side is not ready
 baar se poochhate hai ki kya wo taiyaar hai
 There is a three-week holiday
 is dauraan bhi kuch jaj mukademon ko sunate hai
 The question is whether the number of judges will be eliminated by the termination of leave
 40 hazaar jaj chahie
 There are close to eight thousand judges
 kya is kami ko teen yaa chaar hafte kii chuttee ghataakar puri kii ja sakati he
 Is it possible for a judge to look at the file of twenty cases in a day
 use donon pakshon ko sunakar, kanoon padhakar faisla likhnaa hota he
 Shakespeare also has to be coached in between
 ab samaj aayaa ki hamaare jaj log shakespeare ko hi kyon kot karte rahete hai
 No one else will have time to study
 america ke supreme court main 9 jaj hai
 In all, a decision has to be given in 81 cases in a year
 bharat main ek jaj ausat 2600 mukademon ko sunata he, faisla detaa he
 The Chief Justice said that when the judges come from outside, we are surprised to see
 7 april ko pradeep thakur ne 'times of india' main likhaa he ki ek adhyayan ke anusaar hai court ke jaj ke paas ek mukademe ke liye bas paanch yaa chah minute hi hote hai
 This is the first time such a study has taken place
 jo sabase vyast jaj hai yani jiske paas bahut cese hai uske paas ek cese ko sunne ke liye sirf dhai minute hai
 The one who is least busy has only 15 to 16 minutes
 paanch se chah minute main unhen faisla dena hota he
 Daksha is an institution in Bangalore, he has done this study
 misaal ke taur par kolkata hai court main har din ek jaj ke paas 163 mukademe sunwaayee ke liye aate hai
 The same time is two minutes for a case
 patna, hyderabad, jharkhand, rajasthan ke jajon ke paas har din ek cese ke liye do se teen minute miltaa he
 Is 619 judges of higher and higher offices sufficient for a population of one billion 25 crore
 tippaniyan Anyone would feel that someone is joking with him
 aap sochiye ki aapke saath koun mazaaq kar rahaa he
 After all, why did the governments not increase the number of judges
 adaalaton main suvidhaayen kyon nahin badhaai
 Who is keeping you away from justice
 ek aadmi adaalaton main chalis chalis saal faisle ke liye intazaar karata he
 No judge has two minutes to make his decision
 uskaa intazaar faisle ke liye kam hota he
 If you get that two minutes of your judge in thirty forty years, it is for him
 kya iskaa samaadhaan mukademon kii suchi banane se nikalegaa yaa jajon kii sankhya badhaane se yah sawaal to bahut aasaan he
 Please answer yourself
 uttar pradesh kii haalat to or buree he
 People of western Uttar Pradesh have been demanding a bench for themselves since
 yahaan se lakhanu or elahabaad jate jate sabakuch bik jaataa he
 The Chief Justice also included that the facilities and structures of the courts also have to be taken care of
 meerut ke ek kisaan kii vyathaa he ki ek mukademe ne uski zindagi kis tarah se badal di
 The Allahabad High Court affair with Meerut has ruined him
 vishwa swasthya sanghathan ke anusaar 1000 marijon par ek doctor he
 According to this, there should be 10 doctors in 10,000 but there are 7 doctors in India
 brazil or china main 10,000 par 180 doctor hai
 This is why you have been hearing for many years that the date of operation in such and such government hospital is found after six months to one year
 jiske paas paisa he or aaj kal beemaa he use lagata he ki vah chand minute main doctor haazir kar legaa, lekin aap privet aspataalon main bhi jaakar dekhiye kya haal he
 What a rush there is
 sitambar 2015 main kendriya swasthya mantri ne neshnal health profile jari kii thi jiske anusaar har sarkari aspataal kam se kam 61,000 marizon kaa ilaaj karata he
 There are one bed for 1833 people and each government doctor treats 11,000 people
 ham duniya ke kai garib deshon se bhi kam paisa swasthya par karch karte hai
 If you go to any court, you will feel that you have come to the hospital
 10 lakh kii aabaadi par bharat main jajon kii sankhya mushkil se 15 he
 The judges are so burdened with lawsuits that it takes 20-30 years before the decision comes
 na ilaaj time paras na insaaf time par
 One jumla of the judiciary's world has been so weakened that it has no meaning
 aap jaanate bhi hai
 Justice Delayed Justice Denied
 insaaf main deree ninsaafi he
 When you are so knowledgeable, then who should be punished for that injustice
 insaaf maangane vaale ko di jaae yaa dene vaale ko di jaae
 Many Chief Justices have already mentioned the shortage of judges in India
 2003 main jaipur main lok adaalaton ke sammelan main bolte hue tab ke bharat ke chif justise ve en khare ne kaha tha, adaalaton main backlog kaaphi lanbaa hota ja rahaa he
 Infrastructure is very weak
 jajon kii sankhya kam he
 There are 135 judges in the US with a population of 1 million, in India there are 13 judges on a population of 1 million
 swasthy loktantr ke liye majboot nyaaypalika bahut zaruri he
 Someone must have said before 2003 but 2016 has come
 aapako lagata he ki bich ke pradhan nyaayadhish is masale ko bhul gaye honge
 In 2004, the then Chief Justice of India, Justice RC Lahoti, held that the lack of judges had been blamed for the pending cases
 tribune kii report ke anusaar justise lahoti ne hai court ke mukhya nyayadhishon se kaha tha ki wo nichali adaalaton par nazar rakhen taaki mukademon kii sunwaayee samay se hoti rahe
 You must be thinking that in 2003, 2004, the Chief Justice would have talked about the shortage of judges, then the governments must have come into action
 paanch saal baad 2009 main chif justise ke ji balakrishnan ne 26 nanvabar ko rashtriya kanoon diwas ke maukey par kaha tha ki 2008 main 1
 8 crore new case files were filed, which shows how much confidence people have in the judiciary
 14,000 jajon ne 1 karod 70 lakh mukademon ko nipta bhi diya tha
 Meaning a judge handles 1200 cases in a year
 jajon kii kami or buniyadi dhaanchon kii kami ke baad bhi yah kaam karke dikhaaya gaya he
 In 2008, 40 million cases were heard in Indian courts
 yah aankada duniya ke kisi bhi desh kii adaalat se kai guna zyada he
 This is why it takes many years to complete the trial of the cases
 justise balakrishnan ne kaha tha ki jajon kii itani kami he ki ek jaj ko ek cese par nazar daalane ke liye 25 minute se zyaada nahin milte
 Don't you fear doctor ke paas line
 Line near the judge
 builder ke paas bhi line
 There too, people are facing delays of four years in getting flats
 25 minute ek cese ke liye
 The judge must be working faster than a computer
 yah sab sochate-vichaarte 2016 aa gaya
 Sunday was the day and the opportunity was in the Annual Chief Minister and Chief Justice Conference that the current Chief Justice of India repeats what his former Chief Justice has said
 unhone angrezi main jo kuch kaha, uskaa hindi anuwaad kuch is tarah he- bharat main jajon kii sankhya 7675 se badhaakar 40,357 karne kii zarurat he
 The number of judges should increase from 10 to 50 on a population of one million
 1987 main lau kamishan ne desh main 40,000 hazaar jajon kaa suzav diya tha
 But nothing happened
 2002 main pranab mukherjee ke netritv main sansad kii sthaayee samiti ne bhi kaha tha ki jajon kii sankhya bahut kam he
 There are only ten judges in India with a population of one million
 sthaayee samiti ne suzav diya ki ise 10 se 50 kiya jaae
 The appointment of 50 judges on 10 lakhs makes the number of judges in the country to 40,000
 lekin kuch nahin hua
 On 21 February 2013, Chief Justice Altamas Kabir wrote to the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh but nothing happened
 chif justise tii es thakur nyaaypalika ke har str par jajon kii kami ko lekar bhavuk nahin the
 Were aggressive
 kehete ja rahe the ki hamane har str par charchaa kii he ki nichali adaalaton main jajon kii sankhya badhaai jaani chahie
 The number of judges in the High Court should be increased
 hamane is par charchaa kii or sahamat hue ki subah or shaam kii adaalaton ko shuru karnaa hoga or iske liye sevanivrutt jajon kii madad lee jaae
 Something special will have to be done for under trial in jails for 10 years
 hamane har str par charchaa kii he or sahamat hue hai ki nichali adaalaton or hai court main koi bhi cese paanch saal se zyada purana na ho
 They were going to say that we have discussed for this matter, for that matter
 sahamat hote rahe hai
 They have also discussed that they will use all the grants received under the 14th Finance Commission
 main jaanata hum ki aap vakil nahin hai lekin is desh ke pradhanmantri ke rup main aap jaanate honge ki 1950 main supreme court kii shuruuaat 8 jajon se hui thi
 Then there were only 1215 cases
 hamane ek jaj par 100 mukademon se apni shuruyaat kii thi
 Within a decade, the number of judges increased to 14 and the cases were 3247
 1986 main supreme court main 26 jaj ho gaye or cese kii sankhya ho gai 27,881
 At present, our capacity is 31 and the number of cases is 77,151 till 2014, the number of cases pending against 31 judges was 81,583 which we have reduced to 60,260
 chif justise ne is maukey kaa acha istemaal kiya taaki logon kaa dhyaan jajon kii kami par jaae
 He also told how the number of pending cases has decreased even after the shortage of judges in the Supreme Court
 unhone kaha ki adaalaton main mukademon kii sankhya badhati ja rahi he
 Today 38 lakh 68 thousand cases are pending in the High Court
 434 jajon kii vekency bhari jaani chahie
 Chief Justice said, 'he used to ask the question that if a road is constructed by 5 men in 10 days, if the same road is to be built in a day then how many people are needed
 or uttar hota tha, 50 aadmi chahie
 3868000 How many men are needed to settle the case
 kitne jaj chahie
 Why don't we understand this? ' paanchavin paas ko samajhane ke andaaz main unhone samajha to diya lekin kisi kaa dhyaan us aadmi kii taraf nahin gaya jise jajon kii kami kaa shikaar hona hota he
 Various high profile conferences are held around the country on judiciary issues
 jisamen kabhi mukhyamantri to kabhi pradhanmantri to kabhi chif justise jate rahete hai
 Such a thing is being said in every conference but it has been said for a decade and a half, yet there are not enough reforms
 isi march maheene main khud pradhanmantri ne patna hoicourt kii sthapana ke shatabdi samaaroh main lambit mukademon ko lekar chintaa jaahir kii thi
 In Patna, the Prime Minister said that i have a suggestion, and this idea has just come to me that our courts should bring a bulletin every year highlighting the oldest cases
 kuch chalis saal ke bhi ho sakate hai kuch 50 saal ke bhi ho sakate hai
 This will create a sensibility among the people as to how many cases are pending
 isse ek maahaul banegaa ki kaise in baaki mukademon kaa hal nikaala jaae
 The atmosphere has been created for decades pending information on pending cases
 aae din akhabaaron main report aati he
 Discussions are held in conferences
 sawaal he jajon kii niyukti yaa sankhya badhegi yaa nahin yaa sirf samvedansheeltaa yaa jaagarukta se isamen sudhaar aa jayega
 According to the report of 26 October 2009 Hindu newspaper, then Law Minister Veerappa Moily had said that all the pending cases will be put on the National Grid on 30 November 2009
 neshnal greed par lambit mukademon kaa puraa aankada he
 If you search by the name of NJDG, National Judicial Data Grid, then a page will open on which you will get the list of all the cases till date
 hamane somvaar shaam tak kaa data dekha to There are 22 lakh 58 thousand 441 pending cases in India over 10 years
 5 se 10 saal ke bich main lambit mukademon kii sankhya he 38 lakh, 28 hazaar 117
 It is obvious that we are available to know about the pending cases
 neshnal data greed ke alaava i court kii site par jaakar aap puure desh kii tamaam adaalaton ke mukademon kii sthiti on line dekh sakate hai
 National grid or e-court is for information, but whether these facilities can fill the shortage of judges
 chif justise ne saaf-saaf kaha ki upaay yahi he ki jajon kii sankhya badhaai jaae
 It did not take two months to approve the names we have sent
 koi aapatti he to sidhe hamase baat kii jaae kyonki jajon ko niyukt karne vaali colegium ne lambii prakriya ke tahat naamon ko final kiya he
 In 2010, the Center had decided that a National Litigation Policy would be brought under which states were to reduce the number of their government lawsuits, but according to the final notice of 2015, the cabinet is considering it
 march main hi elahabaad court kii 150veen jayanti ke maukey par raashtrapati pranab mukherjee ne kaha tha ki insaaf main deree ninsaphi he
 The number of judges should be increased and vacant posts should be filled quickly
 ham jaananaa chaahate the ki jaj vaaki kitna kaam karte hai
 Our colleague Ashish Bhargava found out at his level how much work a Supreme Court judge has to do
 kaash ki ham kisi jaj kii puri dincharya camere se shoot karte or aapako dikhaa pate
 i could not believe hearing that the judge could not do any work other than work
 saans kaise lete honge iske liye kisi ko janhit yachika daayar kerani chahie
 Ashish told that a judge has to work for 18 hours daily
 subah das se shaam chaar baje tak court main rahete hai
 After this, go home and rest for one and a half hours
 phir agle din ke mukademon kii taiyaari main lag jate hai
 Every lawsuit has to be seen on file
 koi file 100 pej kii hoti he to koi pachaas pej kii
 Decision between this also has to be dictated
 saadhe gyaarah baje tak sone jate hai or paanch baje uth jate hai
 The judges love walking
 tahalne ke baad subah saat se saadhe aath baje tak phir cese kii taiyaari karte hai
 He leaves for court around half past nine
 kai jaj shanivaar or ravivaar ke din bhi der raat tak kaam karte hai
 In addition to filing cases, listening to the cases filed, writing judgments, they also have other administrative functions
 unki puri kshamta is baat par aanki jaati he ki kitni tezi se ve cese ko sun lete hai, samaj lete hai or faisla dete hai
 The promotion of judges of lower courts depends on how many cases have been dealt
 kya koi jaj ek din main 50 file pard saktaa he
 Judges work from seven in the morning to 11 in the night, then on the day of the holiday
 to kya yah thik he ki unki chuttee par nazar daali jaae
 Chief Justice TS Thakur said that we do not just go to Manali
 jo sanvaidhanik peeth ke jaj hote hai wo apane faisle likh rahe hote hai
 If one side is ready then the other side is not ready
 baar se poochhate hai ki kya wo taiyaar hai
 There is a three-week holiday
 is dauraan bhi kuch jaj mukademon ko sunate hai
 The question is whether the number of judges will be eliminated by the termination of leave
 40 hazaar jaj chahie
 There are close to eight thousand judges
 kya is kami ko teen yaa chaar hafte kii chuttee ghataakar puri kii ja sakati he
 Is it possible for a judge to look at the file of twenty cases in a day
 use donon pakshon ko sunakar, kanoon padhakar faisla likhnaa hota he
 Shakespeare also has to be coached in between
 ab samaj aayaa ki hamaare jaj log shakespeare ko hi kyon kot karte rahete hai
 No one else will have time to study
 america ke supreme court main 9 jaj hai
 In all, a decision has to be given in 81 cases in a year
 bharat main ek jaj ausat 2600 mukademon ko sunata he, faisla detaa he
 The Chief Justice said that when the judges come from outside, we are surprised to see
 7 april ko pradeep thakur ne 'times of india' main likhaa he ki ek adhyayan ke anusaar hai court ke jaj ke paas ek mukademe ke liye bas paanch yaa chah minute hi hote hai
 This is the first time such a study has taken place
 jo sabase vyast jaj hai yani jiske paas bahut cese hai uske paas ek cese ko sunne ke liye sirf dhai minute hai
 The one who is least busy has only 15 to 16 minutes
 paanch se chah minute main unhen faisla dena hota he
 Daksha is an institution in Bangalore, he has done this study
 misaal ke taur par kolkata hai court main har din ek jaj ke paas 163 mukademe sunwaayee ke liye aate hai
 The same time is two minutes for a case
 patna, hyderabad, jharkhand, rajasthan ke jajon ke paas har din ek cese ke liye do se teen minute miltaa he
 Is 619 judges of higher and higher offices sufficient for a population of one billion 25 crore
 tippaniyan Anyone would feel that someone is joking with him
 aap sochiye ki aapke saath koun mazaaq kar rahaa he
 After all, why did the governments not increase the number of judges
 adaalaton main suvidhaayen kyon nahin badhaai
 Who is keeping you away from justice
 ek aadmi adaalaton main chalis chalis saal faisle ke liye intazaar karata he
 No judge has two minutes to make his decision
 uskaa intazaar faisle ke liye kam hota he
 If you get that two minutes of your judge in thirty forty years, it is for him
 kya iskaa samaadhaan mukademon kii suchi banane se nikalegaa yaa jajon kii sankhya badhaane se yah sawaal to bahut aasaan he
 Please answer yourself
 uttar pradesh kii haalat to or buree he
 People of western Uttar Pradesh have been demanding a bench for themselves since
 yahaan se lakhanu or elahabaad jate jate sabakuch bik jaataa he
 The Chief Justice also included that the facilities and structures of the courts also have to be taken care of
 meerut ke ek kisaan kii vyathaa he ki ek mukademe ne uski zindagi kis tarah se badal di
 The Allahabad High Court affair with Meerut has ruined him
 aap kisi bhi adaalat main chale jaaiye aapako lagegaa ki aap aspataal main aa gaye hai
 The number of judges in India is barely 15 on a population of 1 million
 jajon par mukademon kaa itnaa boj he ki faisla aate aate 20-30 saal lag jate hai
 Neither cure time nor justice time
 nyaaypalika kii duniya kaa ek jumala ghiste ghiste itnaa ghis gaya he ki iskaa koi matlab nahin rah gaya
 You also know justise dilade justise denide
 Delay in justice is unfair
 jab itane gyani hai hi to bataaiye ki us ninsaafi kii sazaa kise mili
 Justice should be given to the one who asks or the one who gives it
 bharat main jajon kii kami kaa zikr kai chif justise pehle bhi kar chuke hai
 Speaking at the Lok Adalats conference in Jaipur in 2003, then Chief Justice of India VN Khare had said, the backlog in the courts is getting very long
 buniyadi dhaancha bahut kamazor he
 The number of judges is small
 america main 10 lakh kii aabaadi par 135 jaj hai, bharat main 10 lakh kii aabaadi par 13 jaj hai
 a strong judiciary is essential for healthy democracy
 2003 se pehle bhi kisi ne kaha hi hoga lekin ye 2016 aa gaya he
 You think the Chief Justice of the middle must have forgotten this issue
 2004 main bharat ke tab ke pradhan nyaayadhish ne justise aar si lahoti ne kaha ki lambit mukademon ke liye jajon kii kami ko doshi tehraaya tha
 According to the report of the Tribune, Justice Lahoti had asked the Chief Justices of the High Court to keep an eye on the lower courts so that the trial of the cases would continue in time
 aap soch rahe honge ki 2003, 2004 main chif justise ne jajon kii kami kii baat kii hogi to sarkarein harakat main aa hi gayi hongi
 Five years later, in 2009, Chief Justice KG Balakrishnan said on November 26 on the occasion of National Law Day that in 2008, 1
 8 karod nae cese file hue the jisase pataa chalata he ki logon kaa nyaaypalika main kitna vishwaas he
 14,000 judges had also dealt with 17 million cases
 matlab ek jaj ek saal main 1200 maamalon ko nipta detaa he
 This has been shown to work even after the shortage of judges and lack of infrastructure
 2008 main bhartiya adaalaton main 4 karod 80 lakh mukademon kii sunwaayee hui
 This figure is many times more than the court of any country in the world
 yahi kaaran he ki mukademon kii sunwaayee puri hone main kai saal lag jate hai
 Justice Balakrishnan had said that there is such a shortage of judges that a judge does not get more than 25 minutes to look at a case
 kya aapako dar nahin lagata he
 Line to the doctor
 jaj ke paas line
 Line near builder too
 vahaan bhi logon ko flats milane main chaar saal kii deree kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 25 minutes for a case
 jaj sahab computer se bhi tej kaam karte honge
 All this thoughtful 2016 came
 ravivaar kaa din tha or mauka tha anual chif ministar or chif justices conference main bharat ke maujuuda pradhan nyaayadhish vahi baat doharaate hai jo unke purv ke pradhan nyaayadhish kah gaye hai
 The Hindi translation of what he said in English is something like this - the number of judges in India needs to be increased from 7675 to 40,357
 das lakh kii aabaadi par jajon kii sankhya 10 se badhkar 50 ho
 In 1987, the Law Commission suggested 40,000 thousand judges in the country
 magar kuch nahin hua
 In 2002, the Parliamentary Standing Committee headed by Pranab Mukherjee also said that the number of judges is very less
 bharat main das lakh kii aabaadi par das hi jaj hai
 The standing committee suggested that it be increased from 10 to 50
 10 lakh par 50 jajon kii niyukti se desh main jajon kii sankhya 40,000 ho jaati he
 but nothing happened
 21 farvari 2013 ko chif justise altamas kabir ne tab ke pradhanmantri manmohan singh ko likhaa magar kuch nahin hua
 Chief Justice TS Thakur was not passionate about the shortage of judges at every level of the judiciary
 aakraamak the
 We were saying that we have discussed at every level that the number of judges should be increased in lower courts
 hai court main jajon kii sankhya badhaai jaani chahie
 We discussed this and agreed that morning and evening courts would have to be started and for this the help of retired judges be sought
 10 saal se jelon main band under trial ke liye kuch vishesh karnaa hoga
 We have discussed at every stage and agreed that no case should be more than five years old in the lower courts and the High Court
 wo kehete ja rahe the ki ham is baat ke liye, us baat ke liye charchaa kar chuke hai
 Have been agreeing
 is par bhi charchaa kar chuke hai ki 14 wein vitt ayog ke tahat jo tamaam grant mili hai uskaa istemaal karenge
 i know you are not a lawyer, but as the Prime Minister of this country you would know that in 1950 the Supreme Court started with 8 judges
 tab maatr 1215 cese the
 We started with 100 cases on one judge
 ek dashak ke bheetar jajon kii sankhya 14 hui or cese ho gaye 3247
 In 1986, the Supreme Court had 26 judges and the number of cases was 27,881
 is vakt hamaari kshamta 31 he or mukademon kii sankhya 77,151 2014 tak 31 jajon ke upar lambit mukademon kii sankhya 81,583 thi jise hamane kam karke 60,260 par laa diya he
 The Chief Justice made good use of this opportunity so that the attention of the people goes to the shortage of judges
 unhone yah bhi bataaya ki kis tarah supreme court main jajon kii kami ke baad bhi lambit mukademon kii sankhya main kami ai he
 He said that the number of lawsuits in the courts is increasing
 aaj hai court main 38 lakh 68 hazaar mukademe lambit hai
 Vacancy of 434 judges should be filled
 chif justise ne kaha, 'wo poochhate the sawaal ki agar ek sadak 5 aadmi 10 din main banaate hai, vahi sadak agar ek din main banani ho to kitne aadmi chahie
 And the answer was, 50 people is needed
 3868000 cese ko nipataane ke liye kitne aadmi chahie
 How many judges are needed
 ye baat ham kyon nahin samajhate
 In the way of explaining the Fifth Pass, he gave it, but he did not pay any attention to the man who has to suffer the lack of judges
 desh bhar main nyaaypalika ke muddon ko lekar tarah-tarah ke hai profile sammelan hote rahete hai
 In which sometimes the Chief Minister and sometimes the Prime Minister and sometimes the Chief Justice keep going
 har sammelan main aisi baat kahi ja rahi he magar dedh dashak se kahi ja rahi he phir bhi paryaapt sudhaar nahin hue hai
 In the month of March itself, the Prime Minister himself expressed concern about the pending cases in the centenary celebrations of the establishment of Patna High Court
 patna main pradhanmantri ne kaha tha ki meri ek salaah he, or yah idia mujhe abhi-abhi aayaa he ki hamaari adaalaton ko har saal ek bulatin lekar aani chahie jisamen sabase puraane mukademon ko hilite kiya gaya ho
 Some may be forty years old, some may also be 50 years old
 isse logon main ek samvedansheeltaa jaagegi ki kitne saare mukademen hai jo lambit hai
 This will create an atmosphere of how to solve these other cases
 lambit mukademon kii jaankaree ke prati maahaul to dashakon se ban rahaa he
 Reports come in newspapers every day
 sammelnon main charchaa hoti rahati he
 The question is whether the appointment or number of judges will increase or will it improve only with sensitivity or awareness
 26 aktubar 2009 ke hindu akhbaar kii report ke anusaar tab ke kanoon mantri virappa moili ne kaha tha ki sabhi lambit mukademon ko 30 november 2009 neshnal greed par daal diya jayega
 There is a full figure of pending lawsuits on the national grid
 agar aap NJDG, neshnal judicial data greed ke naam se search karenge to ek pej khulegaa jis par aaj ke samay tak ke saare mukademon kii suchi mil jaaegi
 If we looked at the data till Monday evening 10 saalon se adhik lambit mukademon kii sankhya bharat main 22 lakh 58 hazaar 441 hai
 The number of cases pending between 5 and 10 years is 38 lakh, 28 thousand 117
 zaahir he lambit mukademon ke bare main jaanane ke zariyaa hamaare paas uplabdh he
 Apart from the National Data Grid, you can see the status of the lawsuits of all the courts across the country online by visiting the site of the e-court
 neshnal greed yaa i court jaankaree ke liye he lekin kya ye suvidhaayen jajon kii kami ko puri kar sakati hai
 The Chief Justice clearly stated that the solution is to increase the number of judges
 jo naam hamane bheje hai unhen manzur karne main do-do maheene na lage
 If there is any objection, talk to us directly because the collegium which appointed the judges has finalized the names as part of the long process
 2010 main centre ne tay kiya tha ki ek rashtriya litigeshan niti laai jaaegi jiske tahat rajyon ko apane sarkari mukademon kii sankhya kam kerani thi lekin 2015 tak kii antim soochna ke hisaab se is par cabinut vichaar kar rahi he
 On the occasion of the 150th birth anniversary of Allahabad Court in March itself, President Pranab Mukherjee said that delay in justice is unfair
 jajon kii sankhya badhaani chahie or khaali padon ko jaldi bharna chahie
 We wanted to know how much the judges really do
 hamaare sahyogi ashish bhargav ne apane str par pataa kar bataaya ki supreme court ke kisi jaj ko kitna kaam karnaa padataa he
 i wish we could shoot a judge's entire routine with the camera and show you
 mujhe to sunakar yakeen nahin hua ki jaj sahab kaam ke alaava koi kaam nahin kar pate hai
 One should file a public interest litigation for how to breathe
 ashish ne bataaya ki ek jaj ko rozaana 18 ghante kaam karnaa padataa he
 Remains in the court from ten to four in the morning
 iske baad ghar jaakar dedh ghante aaraam karte hai
 Then they start preparing for the next day's lawsuits
 har mukademe kii file dekhni hoti he
 a file is of 100 pages and some of fifty pages
 iske bich faisla bhi dictate karnaa hota he
 Go to sleep by half past eleven and wake up at five o'clock
 jajon ko tahalnaa acha lagata he
 After a walk from seven to eight in the morning, then prepare the case again
 saadhe nau baje ke aas paas court ke liye nikal jate hai
 Many judges also work late nights on Saturdays and Sundays
 mukademon ko daakhil karnaa, daakhil hue mukademon ko sunanaa, faisla likhane ke alaava unke anya prashasnic kaam bhi hote hai
 Their full potential is judged on how fast they listen to the case, understand it and pass judgment
 nichali adaalaton ke jajon kaa pramotion to inhen baton par tikaa hota he ki kitne cese ko niptaya he
 Can a judge read 50 files in a day
 subah saat baje se raat ke 11 baje tak jaj kaam karte hai, phir chuttee ke din bhi
 So is it okay to look at their vacation? chif justise tii es thakur ne kaha ki ham sirf manali nahin jate hai
 Those who are judges of constitutional bench are writing their decisions
 agar ek paksh taiyaar he to doosraa paksh taiyaar nahin he
 Ask Bar whether he is ready
 teen hafte kii chuttee hoti he
 During this time also some judges listen to the cases
 sawaal he ki kya chuttee samaapt kar dene se jajon kii sankhya kii zarurat samaapt ho jaaegi
 40 thousand judges are required
 aath hazaar ke kareeb jaj hai
 Can this deficiency be reduced by reducing the leave to three or four weeks
 kya ye mumkin hai ki koi jaj ek din main bees mukademon kii file dekh le
 He has to listen to both sides, read the law and write the decision
 bich-bich main shakespeare ko bhi kot karnaa hota he
 Now i understand why our judges continue to quote Shakespeare
 duusare kisi ko padhane kaa vakt hi nahin miltaa hoga
 The Supreme Court of America has 9 judges
 sabko milakar ek saal main 81 keson main faisla dena hota he
 In India, a judge hears an average of 2600 lawsuits, passing judgment
 chif justise ne kaha ki jab baahar se jaj aate hai to hamen dekhakar hairaan hote hai
 On 7 April, Pradeep Thakur wrote in the 'times of India' that according to a study, a High Court judge has only five or six minutes for a trial
 pehali baar aisa adhyayan hua he
 The busiest judge, that is, he who has a lot of cases, has only two and a half minutes to hear a case
 jo sabase kam vyast he uske paas maatr 15 se 16 minute hai
 They have to give a decision in five to six minutes
 bangaloru kii ek sanstha he daksh usne ye adhyayan kiya he
 For example, 163 judges come to the Kolkata High Court every day for a hearing
 ek cese ke liye do minute jitna hi samay hota he
 The judges of Patna, Hyderabad, Jharkhand, Rajasthan get two to three minutes for a case every day
 kya ek arab 25 karod kii aabaadi ke liye ucch or ucchtam nyaalayon ke 619 jaj paryaapt he
 The comments kisi ko bhi lagegaa ki uske saath koi mazaaq kar rahaa he
 Think who is joking with you
 aakhir sarkaron ne jajon kii sankhya kyon nahin badhaai
 Why did the facilities in the courts not be increased
 aapako insaaf se koun dur rakh rahaa he
 a man waits for forty years in the courts for a verdict
 uske faisle ke liye kisi jaj ke paas do minute kaa vakt nahin he
 His wait for decision is short
 tees chalis saal main jaj sahab kaa wo do minute mil jaae, uske liye hota he
 Will the solution come out of making a list of cases or is this question very easy by increasing the number of judges
 jawaab aap khud dijie
 The condition of Uttar Pradesh is worse
 pashchim uttar pradesh ke log kab se apane liye ek bench kii maang kar rahe hai

 chif justise kii baat main yah bhi shaamil he ki adaalaton kii suvidhaon or dhaanchon par bhi dhyaan dena hoga
 a farmer in Meerut is saddened by how a lawsuit changed his life
 meerut se elahabaad hai court ke chakkar ne use barbaad kar diya he
 Someone must have said before 2003 but 2016 has come
 aapako lagata he ki bich ke pradhan nyaayadhish is masale ko bhul gaye honge
 In 2004, the then Chief Justice of India, Justice RC Lahoti, held that the lack of judges had been blamed for the pending cases
 tribune kii report ke anusaar justise lahoti ne hai court ke mukhya nyayadhishon se kaha tha ki wo nichali adaalaton par nazar rakhen taaki mukademon kii sunwaayee samay se hoti rahe
 You must be thinking that in 2003, 2004, the Chief Justice would have talked about the shortage of judges, then the governments must have come into action
 paanch saal baad 2009 main chif justise ke ji balakrishnan ne 26 nanvabar ko rashtriya kanoon diwas ke maukey par kaha tha ki 2008 main 1
 8 crore new case files were filed, which shows how much confidence people have in the judiciary
 14,000 jajon ne 1 karod 70 lakh mukademon ko nipta bhi diya tha
 Meaning a judge handles 1200 cases in a year
 jajon kii kami or buniyadi dhaanchon kii kami ke baad bhi yah kaam karke dikhaaya gaya he
 In 2008, 40 million cases were heard in Indian courts
 yah aankada duniya ke kisi bhi desh kii adaalat se kai guna zyada he
 This is why it takes many years to complete the trial of the cases
 justise balakrishnan ne kaha tha ki jajon kii itani kami he ki ek jaj ko ek cese par nazar daalane ke liye 25 minute se zyaada nahin milte
 Don't you fear doctor ke paas line
 Line near the judge
 builder ke paas bhi line
 There too, people are facing delays of four years in getting flats
 25 minute ek cese ke liye
 The judge must be working faster than a computer
 yah sab sochate-vichaarte 2016 aa gaya
 Sunday was the day and the opportunity was in the Annual Chief Minister and Chief Justice Conference that the current Chief Justice of India repeats what his former Chief Justice has said
 unhone angrezi main jo kuch kaha, uskaa hindi anuwaad kuch is tarah he- bharat main jajon kii sankhya 7675 se badhaakar 40,357 karne kii zarurat he
 The number of judges should increase from 10 to 50 on a population of one million
 1987 main lau kamishan ne desh main 40,000 hazaar jajon kaa suzav diya tha
 But nothing happened
 2002 main pranab mukherjee ke netritv main sansad kii sthaayee samiti ne bhi kaha tha ki jajon kii sankhya bahut kam he
 There are only ten judges in India with a population of one million
 sthaayee samiti ne suzav diya ki ise 10 se 50 kiya jaae
 The appointment of 50 judges on 10 lakhs makes the number of judges in the country to 40,000
 lekin kuch nahin hua
 On 21 February 2013, Chief Justice Altamas Kabir wrote to the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh but nothing happened
 chif justise tii es thakur nyaaypalika ke har str par jajon kii kami ko lekar bhavuk nahin the
 Were aggressive
 kehete ja rahe the ki hamane har str par charchaa kii he ki nichali adaalaton main jajon kii sankhya badhaai jaani chahie
 The number of judges in the High Court should be increased
 hamane is par charchaa kii or sahamat hue ki subah or shaam kii adaalaton ko shuru karnaa hoga or iske liye sevanivrutt jajon kii madad lee jaae
 Something special will have to be done for under trial in jails for 10 years
 hamane har str par charchaa kii he or sahamat hue hai ki nichali adaalaton or hai court main koi bhi cese paanch saal se zyada purana na ho
 They were going to say that we have discussed for this matter, for that matter
 sahamat hote rahe hai
 They have also discussed that they will use all the grants received under the 14th Finance Commission
 main jaanata hum ki aap vakil nahin hai lekin is desh ke pradhanmantri ke rup main aap jaanate honge ki 1950 main supreme court kii shuruuaat 8 jajon se hui thi
 Then there were only 1215 cases
 hamane ek jaj par 100 mukademon se apni shuruyaat kii thi
 Within a decade, the number of judges increased to 14 and the cases were 3247
 1986 main supreme court main 26 jaj ho gaye or cese kii sankhya ho gai 27,881
 At present, our capacity is 31 and the number of cases is 77,151 till 2014, the number of cases pending against 31 judges was 81,583 which we have reduced to 60,260
 chif justise ne is maukey kaa acha istemaal kiya taaki logon kaa dhyaan jajon kii kami par jaae
 He also told how the number of pending cases has decreased even after the shortage of judges in the Supreme Court
 unhone kaha ki adaalaton main mukademon kii sankhya badhati ja rahi he
 Today 38 lakh 68 thousand cases are pending in the High Court
 434 jajon kii vekency bhari jaani chahie
 Chief Justice said, 'he used to ask the question that if a road is constructed by 5 men in 10 days, if the same road is to be built in a day then how many people are needed
 or uttar hota tha, 50 aadmi chahie
 3868000 How many men are needed to settle the case
 kitne jaj chahie
 Why don't we understand this? ' paanchavin paas ko samajhane ke andaaz main unhone samajha to diya lekin kisi kaa dhyaan us aadmi kii taraf nahin gaya jise jajon kii kami kaa shikaar hona hota he
 Various high profile conferences are held around the country on judiciary issues
 jisamen kabhi mukhyamantri to kabhi pradhanmantri to kabhi chif justise jate rahete hai
 Such a thing is being said in every conference but it has been said for a decade and a half, yet there are not enough reforms
 isi march maheene main khud pradhanmantri ne patna hoicourt kii sthapana ke shatabdi samaaroh main lambit mukademon ko lekar chintaa jaahir kii thi
 In Patna, the Prime Minister said that i have a suggestion, and this idea has just come to me that our courts should bring a bulletin every year highlighting the oldest cases
 kuch chalis saal ke bhi ho sakate hai kuch 50 saal ke bhi ho sakate hai
 This will create a sensibility among the people as to how many cases are pending
 isse ek maahaul banegaa ki kaise in baaki mukademon kaa hal nikaala jaae
 The atmosphere has been created for decades pending information on pending cases
 aae din akhabaaron main report aati he
 Discussions are held in conferences
 sawaal he jajon kii niyukti yaa sankhya badhegi yaa nahin yaa sirf samvedansheeltaa yaa jaagarukta se isamen sudhaar aa jayega
 According to the report of 26 October 2009 Hindu newspaper, then Law Minister Veerappa Moily had said that all the pending cases will be put on the National Grid on 30 November 2009
 neshnal greed par lambit mukademon kaa puraa aankada he
 If you search by the name of NJDG, National Judicial Data Grid, then a page will open on which you will get the list of all the cases till date
 hamane somvaar shaam tak kaa data dekha to There are 22 lakh 58 thousand 441 pending cases in India over 10 years
 5 se 10 saal ke bich main lambit mukademon kii sankhya he 38 lakh, 28 hazaar 117
 It is obvious that we are available to know about the pending cases
 neshnal data greed ke alaava i court kii site par jaakar aap puure desh kii tamaam adaalaton ke mukademon kii sthiti on line dekh sakate hai
 National grid or e-court is for information, but whether these facilities can fill the shortage of judges
 chif justise ne saaf-saaf kaha ki upaay yahi he ki jajon kii sankhya badhaai jaae
 It did not take two months to approve the names we have sent
 koi aapatti he to sidhe hamase baat kii jaae kyonki jajon ko niyukt karne vaali colegium ne lambii prakriya ke tahat naamon ko final kiya he
 In 2010, the Center had decided that a National Litigation Policy would be brought under which states were to reduce the number of their government lawsuits, but according to the final notice of 2015, the cabinet is considering it
 march main hi elahabaad court kii 150veen jayanti ke maukey par raashtrapati pranab mukherjee ne kaha tha ki insaaf main deree ninsaphi he
 The number of judges should be increased and vacant posts should be filled quickly
 ham jaananaa chaahate the ki jaj vaaki kitna kaam karte hai
 Our colleague Ashish Bhargava found out at his level how much work a Supreme Court judge has to do
 kaash ki ham kisi jaj kii puri dincharya camere se shoot karte or aapako dikhaa pate
 i could not believe hearing that the judge could not do any work other than work
 saans kaise lete honge iske liye kisi ko janhit yachika daayar kerani chahie
 Ashish told that a judge has to work for 18 hours daily
