 In the industry, the Meetu Movement gained momentum last year when Tanushree Dutta made serious allegations against actor Nana Patekar

 Now people are saying this is a good thing
 mujhe nahin pataa ki industry ab sef he yaa nahin lekin itnaa jarur he ki ab logon main dar paidaa ho gaya he
 Whatever the industry, people are afraid that if they do something wrong, they can leave their jobs

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi is very much talking about giving reservation to the poor of the general class
 agra main aaj ek raily ke dauraan unhone kaha ki hamaari sarkaar dalit-adivasee yaa pichhadon se chori kiye bina savarnon ko aarakshan diya he, lekin pehle sarkarein chori kar tushtikaran kar jholii bharna chaahati thim
 But a video has come out that according to which he considered reservation as a waste of time while being the Chief Minister of Gujarat
 ajtak ke utyub channel 'newstak' ke paas uplabdh video main unhen suna ja saktaa he
 In this, he is calling reservation a waste of time
 ek intervyuu main vah kah rahe hai, 'agar harek ke liye shiksha kii suvidha ho
 
 
 Then who will ask for reservation? If there is a chance for a job for all
 
 
 tab aarakshan ke liye koun poochhega? isliye hamen samruddhi ke yug kaa nirmaan karnaa hoga
 Once we create an era of prosperity, no one will talk about reservation
 aisa karnaa vakt kii barbaadi he
 Because our entire economy is a scarcity system
 hamen kam ko zyada tak main tabdeel karnaa hoga, or gujarat ek samruddhi kaa model he
 But speaking on reservation in Agra, PM Modi said, an important step has been taken for reservation of upper caste poor families in educational institutions and government institutions
 pehle bhi chunaav ke samay narebaaji bahut hui, main bhi kahata tha ki 50 fisadi ke upar aarakshan kahkar sarkaar beimaani karti hai
 If you want to go above 50 percent, you cannot go without amending the constitution
 pehle jo karte the wo dalit-adivasee kaa haq chori kar jholii bharna chaahate the, taaki unki vot bank kii jholii bhar jaae
 The Prime Minister said that the Central Government brought amendments to the constitution to give the reservation and he thanked all the mps for this
 garibi kisi ke vikaas main aadchan na bane, isliye yah aarakshan kii vyavastha kii gai he
 Not only reservation, it has also been decided to increase the seats of higher education by 10 percent
 baharhaal bataa den ki newstak ke paas uplabdh is video ko 2013 main aplod kiya gaya tha
 The Constitution Amendment Bill to provide 10% reservation to upper castes in government jobs and higher education institutions was passed in the Lok Sabha on Monday
 is 10 fisadi aarakshan ke praavdhaan vaale vidheyak kaa lagbhag sabhi dalon ne samarthan kiya he
 Saturday 27 August will be recorded in the history books as a day of extraordinary victory in the history of democracy
 us roj loktantr kii sarvshereshth paramparaon ke mutabik donon virdohi khemon kii jeet hui
 While Anna Hazare captured the heart of the nation with his energetic zeal and clear commitment, Parliament was also inspired by a courageous performance that re-decided that if its members were to be punished instead of the messers
 If given the opportunity to be a member, what kind of institution could she be? team anna or sansad ne joardaar bahes main aisa samjhauta kiya jisamen ek lokapal kaa vaada kiya gaya, jo bharat ke sade-gale satta pratishthan ke astabalon kii safai karne kaa bada kaam shuru kar saktaa he
 But after nightfall and morning, there was a long shadow of uncertainty on the battlefield
 haalanki samajhaita ho gaya tha par log maidan se hate nahin the
 In the midst of all this there is an explosive question: Can political parties, used to win the day, use this peace to forget the proposed bill, and cleverly make the institution hollow which Anna Hazare thought to be absolutely flawless Was? On August 27, the motion of the spirit of the House was passed by thumping the table, no voice vote was made for it as is the custom
 isamen sarkaar or sansad ke batch nikalne kaa ek antarnihit vikalp he jisase team anna ke lokapal vidheyak sanskaran ke saath aasaani se bhitaraghaat ho saktaa he
 The resolution states: "this House is agreed in principle on the following issues: Citizens' Charter, through proper system, the lower level bureaucracy should also be placed within the Lokpal and to make Lokayukta in the States
" ''byore main pehla pech ''siddhanthata'' shabd daalana he
 This means that the Parliament team is not committed to implementing Anna's three demands
 doosraa chota pech 'uchit vyavastha ke jariye' he, jo lokapal ke daayre main nichle str kii naukarshahi ko laane se pehle lagaaya gaya he
 There are other points that could make Team Anna's bill fragile
 pradhanmantri ko lokapal ke daayre main laane ke maamle main ab bhi aam sahmati nahin bani he bhale hi team anna kaa maananaa he, shaayad samay se pehle, ki usne yah ladaai jeet lee he
 Apart from this, there is a controversial issue as to who will appoint the Lokpal
 is sawaal kaa bhi jawaab nahin diya gaya he ki sadan ke bheetar saansadon kii harakat lokapal kii jaanch kaa vishay hogi yaa nahin-hajaare unhen javabdeh bananaa chaahate hai, lekin saansadon ko isamen dilchaspee nahin he
 Team Anna wants the anti-corruption part of CBI to be under the Lokpal
 sansad shaayad isaki ijaajat na de lekin lokapal ko ek alag team de sakati he or uski karmchaariyon kii jarurat ko sarkaar kii manjuuri kaa vishay bana sakati he
 Can mps defraud Anna Hazare's promise to the nation? Now the fate of this bill is referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Law and Justice headed by Congress MP Abhishek Manu Singhvi
 congress ne hajaare kii maangon ke prati apni eemaandaaree us samay dikhaane kii koshish kii jab manish tiwari khud hi is samiti se baahar ho gaye
 Tiwari, a Congress MP from Ludhiana, first described Anna Hazare as "corrupt from head to toe" and then later apologized apologizing for it
 samiti ke ek or sadsy amar singh, jinke khilaaf note ke badale vot maamle main aaropapatr daakhil kiya janaa he, bhi vidheyak par vichaar-vimarsh main hissaa nahin lenge
 Despite this, many of the 31 members, including RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav, will try to weaken Team Anna's version
 ek ore jahaan hajaare ke anshan ke baad civil socity vijeta ke rup main ubhari, vahiin saansadon kaa sabhy vyavhaar bhi jeet gaya
 On 27 August, the nation's eyes were set on television sets
 log cricket nahin dekh rahe the
 He was watching the proceedings of Parliament
 media research agency tam ke jutaaye aankadon ke mutabik, us roj samachar channelon se prasaarit 95 fisadi saamagree jan lokapal vidheyak par bahes se judi thi
 After 10 days of anger against indifference against corruption in particular, the government and the political class in general, the people of India were able to re-imagine the important role of Parliament
 2010 main loksabhaa kii keval 282 ghante kaarywahi chali jabaki 2009 main 355 ghante tak chali thi or usee saal aam chunaav hua tha
 The proceedings of Rajya Sabha lasted only 252 hours in 2010 as against 321 hours in 2009
 2010 kaa sheetakaaleen satr yun hi nikal gaya kyonki sarkaar ne 2ji ghotaale par sanyukt sansadeey samiti banane kii maang ke aage jhukne se inkaar kar diya
 Parliament status had fallen into a trough, but a debate on the Lokpal improved its image
 us roj sansad main dilachasp bahes hui or vibhinn dalon ke saansadon ne jabardast hastkshep kiya, abhinayta om puri or activist kiran bedi ke ashisht vyangy ko karaara jawaab diya
 Puri and Bedi had mocked the mps at Ramlila Maidan, calling them illiterate and illiterate
 apane dehati mul par garv karne vaale do saansadon ne shandaar bhaashan diya
 JD (U) MP and NDA convenor Sharad Yadav said, "without the foresight of people like Ambedkar and Mahatma Gandhi, people like me wouldn't be allowed to come to Delhi to feed their animals too
" '' lekin unhone congress ke un yuva saansadon ko bujurgon vaali naseehat di, jo hakeekat se cat se gaye lagate hai
 He asked to learn politics by joining the land instead of inheriting politics
 yadav ne poocha, ''sirf isliye ki kisi ke pita netaa hai to yah peedi badlaav kaa kya vichaar he?'' lalu prasad yadav ne team anna ko sakht chetavanee di, ''sansad sarvocch he or iske adhikaar se samajhaita nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Other mps adopted a more reconciled attitude
 bhaajapa ke yuva saansad varun gandhi ne yah kehete hue gambhirtha dikhaane kii koshish kii, ''hamaara kartavya janata kii raay ko jaahir karnaa he, uske bare main faisla dena yaa use nirast karnaa nahin he
 "congress MP Jyotiraditya Scindia moved to Hazare with one sentence in Marathi
 arun jetali ne sansad main apana badhiya form barkaraar rakhaa or yah kehete hue bhaajapa ke sabase majboot saansad ke rup main apni pahchaan majboot kii, ''bhartiya loktantr kii ek badi takat yah he ki ham virodh pradarshan karte hai, hamaare yahaan sankat aate hai, ham sangharsh karte hai, lekin hamamen lacheelepan kii jabardast samaj he
 We show exceptional maturity in resolving every crisis
 ''team anna ko 26 agast ko sansad main congress ke bhavi pramukh rahul gandhi ke hastkshep se bhi chintit hona chahie
 Rahul could not attend the main debate on 27 August as he went to meet his ailing mother
 rahul kaa dakhal sansadeey parampara ke viruddh tha, jisamen shunya kaal ke dauraan likhit bhaashan kii manaahi he
 The main point of his intervention was: "why not raise the status of this debate by making the Lokpal accountable to Parliament like the Election Commission of India and why should the Lokpal be strengthened?" Whereas he described it as game-changing
 sanvaidhanik sanshodhan lambey samay tak chalane vaali prakriya he kyonki iske liye sansad or rajya vidhansabhaon kii manjuuri jaruri hoti he, zyaadaatar samay yah mushkil kaam he
 He showed toughness against Team Anna, saying, "policy intervention aside from the system of elected government creates a dangerous pattern for democracy that seeks to eliminate measures to protect the supremacy of Parliament
" ''yah ek roj pehle hi hajaare se pradhanmantri ke utsuk aagrah ke bilkul ulat tha
 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had urged him to end the fast saying, "your life is very precious
" '' pradhanmantri kii apil kaa samarthan karne vaali sushamaa swaraj ne rahul ke bhaashan kii aalochana kii
 He said, "on the one hand, while the Prime Minister introduced the art of governance one day, the next day the Congress General Secretary threw water on it
 ''lokapal par pradhanmantri or rahul kaa matbhed sadan main ujagar ho gaya
 It is said that this difference is more than that which is seen by Rahul's speech
 sutron ke mutabik, rahul ne darasal bhaashan padhane se pehle use pradhanmantri ko dikhaaya tha
 "the Prime Minister asked him to reduce his attack on civil society," the source said
 '' unka halakaa sanskaran bhi team anna ke liye aakraamak tha

 '' saath yah bhi jad diya, ''2ji ghotaale ke aankadon ke saath koi mail mahaj ek ittefaq he
 Ultimately, it was not political speculation but political acumen that worked because Mukherjee finalized the statement himself
 lekin sarkaar ke vakil mantriyon kii baat maan lee gai
 The word 'in principle' was reportedly added at Sibal's insistence
 unhone chetaya ki sarkaar ko aisa koi vaada nahin karnaa chahie jise vah nibhaa nahin sake
 Later Swaraj repeated the same thing
 prastaav ko sansad main pesh kiye jane se pehle use team anna or vipaksh ne manjuuri di
 Hazare was initially promised that the motion would be passed by voice vote, but this could be another example of political trickery to defeat Team Anna, with Mukherjee passing him by thumping the table in the House

 Nikhil Dey, a key member of the Aruna Rai-led National Campaign for People's Right to Information (NCPRI), which also has Arvind Kejriwal, during a round table discussion in India Today on August 29 about the merits of various versions of the Lokpal Bill
 Argued that the Citizens' Charter of the Jan Lokpal Bill, which the Parliament agreed to include in the Bill, is so intriguing that it is the only one Paul could not handle it
 de kii daleel he ki shikaayat nivaaran bhrashtachar se alag he or isamen anya sarkari kaaryakramon ke alaava rojgaar, khadyann, swasthya or shiksha tathaa delivery system shaamil hai
 The differences between NCPRI and Team Anna have been in place since Hazare's first fast in April
 usase pehle sab ek saath kaam kar rahe the, jan lokapal vidheyak par ek saath bahes kar rahe the
 Shekhar Singh of NCPRI confirmed this to India Today
 unhone kaha, ''4 april tak ham ek saath vidheyak par charchaa kar rahe the
 Arvind Kejriwal and Prashant Bhushan are both members of the Executive Committee of NCPRI
 ''shekhar ke mutabik, hajaare ke anshan ke faisle par matbhed khadaa ho gaya
 Shekhar says, "we wanted Anna Hazare not to go on hunger strike until we could resolve some differences by negotiating
" ''9 april ko jab anshan khatm hua to aruna raay ko civil socity kaa pratinidhitiv karne vaali drafting cameti main shaamil nahin kiya gaya
 When India Today asked Kejriwal why Aruna Roy was not included, he said, "the government should have named Arunaji on its behalf, she is a member of the National Advisory Council (NAC)
" ''shekhar jor dekar kehete hai ki drafting cameti main raay ko shaamil na kiya janaa samasya nahin he
 He says, "the problem started when he adopted the attitude that those who do not support the Jan Lokpal Bill are either corrupt or are advocates of corruption
 unki yah jid ki unheen kaa sanskaran sahi he or use hi sansad main pesh kiya janaa chahie, hamaare liye samasya thi
 "they all have their own image, territory and stakes that they have to protect," says a senior civil rights activist

 Sometimes the basic issue becomes secondary in such situations
 ''civil socity ke kuch duusare sadsy team anna kii vishwasaneeyata par sawaal uthaa rahe hai
 Arundhati Roy, who has been unnaturally silent since the Lokpal issue first arose in April, sees a "well-known agenda of the World Bank" in the movement

 She is now accusing Kejriwal and Kiran Bedi of running voluntary organizations that receive foreign funding from the Ford and Rockefeller Foundation, thus running the agenda of these international ngos

 yah bahut khatarnaak he
 "she can easily get distracted by Team Anna's strong opposition from other sections of civil society
" lekin kejariwal aisa na hone dene ke liye patibaddh hai
 "we have great respect for Arunaji (rai)
 jan lokapal vidheyak or ensipiarai ke sanskaran main shaayad hi koi antar he
 It can be resolved by negotiation
 '' phir ve kuch maayusi ke saath kehete hai, ''unase baatcheet shuru karne kii hamaari sari koshish naakaam ho gai
 "parliament's standing committee team will hear Anna and other mismatched voices of civil society
" aisa nahin lagata ki lokapal vidheyak kaa antim sanskaran team anna kii maangon ke mutabik taiyaar kiya ho sakegaa
 But if the bill becomes more different from his demands, then it will be considered about Team Anna that he broke the promise made to the people of India

 Actually, after losing the election, Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot could not meet Rahul Gandhi due to which many rumors were flying
 magar rahul gandhi ke janmdin par jis garmjoshi ke saath ashok gahalot unase mili
 The photos of the meeting put these rumors to a halt
 uske baad ye bhi kaha gaya ki congress ke sabase bade netaa sonia gandhi ne ashok gahalot ko bulaakar mulaakaat kii he
 Many political results began to emerge from this meeting
 yah khabar teji se faili ki rahul gandhi congress ke rashtriya adhyaksh ke pad se istipha dene par ade hue hai or aisi paristhitiyon main gandhi parivaar ke sabase bharosemand ashok gahalot ko congress kaa taj diya ja saktaa he

 Ferozabad, which has become the traditional seat of the Mulayam Singh Yadav family, has an interesting contest this time
 vajah ki yahaan chachaa or bhatija aamane-saamne hai
 BJP is also making the contest triangular
 varsh 2014 ke modi lahar main bhi yah seat sapa ke mahasachiv ramgopal ke bete akshay yadav ko mil gai thi, lekin is baar paristhitiyaan thodi badali hui hai
 From here, two stalwarts of the Saifai family are face to face
 samaajawaadee party se alag hokar nai party banane vaale shivpal yadav apane bhattije or nivartmaan saansad akshay yadav se taal thokane ko taiyaar hai
 The BJP has also tried to take full advantage of the confrontation of these two veterans in the Saifai family and has made the fight triangular by nominating its old worker Dr
 Chandrasen Jadaun as its candidate
 jansangh ke jamaane se jude dow
 Jadoun contested from Ghirore assembly in 1996 on a BJP ticket, but could not win
 varisht raajnneetik vishleshak vinay chaturvedi firozabad seat ko sapa kii paramparaagat seat maan rahe hai
 They say that sp's Ramji Lal Suman won consecutive Sansadi elections in the years 1999 and 2004, but in 2009 SP chief Akhilesh Yadav contested and won and now it became a family dominated seat
 akhilesh ke seat chhodane se hue upachunaav main saifai parivaar kii bahu or akhilesh kii patni dimple yadav chunaav maidan main thim, lekin congress ke raaj babbar se chunaav haar gai thim
 Despite this, this seat once came in the Saifai family in the 2014 elections
 akshay yadav ne bhaajapa ke es
 P
 singh baghel ko kareeb 1 lakh 14 hajaar 59 voton se haraaya tha
 Here Yadav voters are playing a pivotal role
 jasrana or sirsaganj main unki tadaad lagbhag 1
 5 lakhs
 lekin unamem bikharaav bhi hoga
 Shivpal Yadav is an old player in organization politics
 sapa ke puraane kaaryakartaaon main unki aaj bhi pakad he
 Shivpal, the leader of the opposition and a minister in different governments, is also getting huge support here
 yah baat alag he ki kuch unke virodh main bhi hai
 Now this seat has not become easy for the SP due to Shivpal's landing
 vishleshak vinay chaturvedi ke mutabik, akshay yadav ke paas sapa ke saath ab basapa kii bhi takat he jo unhen majboot banaati he
 The Congress has not fielded any of its candidates here
 aise main yadavon ke saath kuch vot unhen jatvon or musalamaanon kaa miltaa dikh rahaa he, lekin sapa se baagi hue teen baar ke vidhayak hariom yadav or purv vidhayak azim bhai ne sapa kaa daaman choda he
 Now Shivpal is in the camp
 shivpal ke saath dene vaale azim kii shahar ke musalaamanon main acchhee pakad maani jaati he
 a part of the vote of the Musalmans cannot be ruled out in favor of Shivpal
 unhone bataaya ki shivpal ke kaaran bhaajapa dwaara dami ummidavaar utaarne kii afvaah thi, lekin chandrasen jadon ke chunaav maidan main aane se afvaah par purnaviram lag gaya he
 The battle has become interesting
 amit shah unke paksh main jansabha kar parivaarwaad ke khilaaf hamalaa bol chuke hai
 Chandrasen is experienced in the eyes of Chaturvedi
 unhen modi ke naam kaa phayda bhi milegaa
 Despite this, it is a challenge to get votes in the sp's stronghold assembly constituencies
 vajah, sapa ke saath prasapa bhi maidan main he
 All are trying to put the party's original vote bank in their favor
 chandrasen ke saath baghel birdari kaa vot unke paksh main aa saktaa he
 Also, some others can breach the backward vote
 agar shivpal ne thodi bhi majbootee se ladaai ladi or basapa kaa vot sapa ke paksh main tabdeel nahin hua to bhaajapa ko phayda ho saktaa he
 MP Akshay Yadav has solved the water problem to some extent by starting the Jada Jhal project in the city
 medical college bhi banwaaya he
 Firozabad is connected by Agra Lucknow Expressway

 The triple talaq bill was discussed in the Lok Sabha on Thursday during the winter session

 In this episode, Meenakshi Lekhi, MP of the Bharatiya Janata Party from New Delhi, cited the three divorces as atrocities for women, citing the Quran and Prophet Mohammad
 kendriya alpsankhyak mantri mukhtaar abbaas nakvi ne bhi shairana andaaj main apni baat rakhi
 Meenakshi Lekhi commented on opposition parties, citing politics on the issue of triple talaq
 unhone kaha ki jo party khud ko secular kahati he, vahi dharm kaa galat istemaal karti he
 On this, he also read this poetry
 
 
 auraton ke liye tumhaara chalan niraala kyon he,jo kehete ho ki dharm saaf he to ye niyam kaala kyon he,shikaayat masjidon se nahin, par fatvon se he mujhe,tumne auraton ko apane dharm se nikaala kyon haitin talaak kii pratha par bhi tanjaminakshi lekhi ne phone kol, watsap or email ke jariye die jane vaale teen talaak ko badi buraai bataate hue ise bhi shaayari padhakar bayaan kiya
 They said
 
 
 kabhi sangeen, kabhi majaak ban jayega,mitti kaa sharir khaak ban jayega,jaraa ehtiyaat barat rakeeb mere,na jane koun sa telephone talaak ban jaaegasarkaar kii patibaddhta par bhi shaayritin talaak jaisi kupratha ko khatm karne ke liye modi sarkaar kii patibaddhta ko bhi minakshi lekhi ne shaayari ke jariye sadan ke bich rakhaa
 He said that the intention of our government is to provide justice and to eliminate corruption from the country
 isiilie teen talaak ko lekar yah bill laayaa ja rahaa he
 On this, he said, 'write this writing on every milestone, the destination is not found with failed intentions
 'muslim mahilaon ko bharosaminakshi lekhi ne apane bhaashan ke ant main muslim mahilaon ko insaaf milane kaa bharosa bhi dilaayaa
 For this he also took recourse to poetry and read the lines written by the famous poet Dag Dehalvi
 
 
 meri aah kaa tum asar dekh lenaavo aaenge tham-e jigar dekh lenaarakh hausala wo manjar bhi aegapyaase ke paas chalakar samandar bhi aegamukhtaar abbaas nakvi ne bhi shaayari padhikendriya alpsankhyak mantri mukhtaar abbaas nakvi ne bhi teen talaak ke masale par apni raay rakhte hue shaayari kaa istemaal kiya
 He even started his speech in a shaire manner and criticized the former Congress government, citing the shah-bano case
 nakvi ne kaha, 'kabhi-kabhi lamhon kii khata sadiyon kii sajaa ban jaati he
 Reading these lines, Naqvi said that after the Shah Bano case nearly three decades ago, the decision of the court during the Congress government in this House was nullified
 or aaj modi sarkaar is kanoon ko prabhavi kar rahi he

 ’ unhone iske liye rajya kii janata, raajnneetik dalon, suraksha balon or matdaankaryon main lage logon ko khaastaur par dhanyavad diya The demise of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) veteran leader Arun Jaitley is a big loss for the party
 jetali ko party kaa sankatmochak bhi kaha jaataa tha
 He performed this responsibility well many times
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne twit kar unhen diggaj raajnneetik bataate hue kaha ki vah ek mukhar netaa the,jo bauddhik or kanoonee kshetra main dakshata rakhte the
 At the same time, party president and home minister Amit Shah said that the loss of Arun Jaitley's death cannot be recovered quickly
 amit shah ne arun jetali ke nidhan ko vyaktigat nuksaan bhi bataaya
 Many BJP leaders attribute Jaitley's death as a personal loss, not just the party
 vajah ki jetali sankat ke samay netaaon kii vyaktigat taur par bhi madad karne main aage the
 During his political career, Arun Jaitley served in several roles in the BJP
 vah padon tak simit rahane kii bajaae har tarah kii jimmedaariyaan aage badhkar nibhaate rahe
 It is being said that it is impossible for the BJP to find an alternative to Arun Jaitley but not difficult
 1-koun set karegaa jetali kii tarah party kaa nerretirun jetali ne hameshaa bijepi kaa nerrative set kiya
 BJP leader and Union Minister Nitin Gadkari himself agrees
 nitin gadakari kaa kahana he ki arun jetali ne bauddhikon ke bich bijepi kaa nerrative set karne main ahm bhoomika nibhaai
 Jaitley used to decide very well what the media strategy would be during the elections
 yahi nahin, party kii har meeting se pehle jitani taiyaari arun jetali karke aate the, utana shaayad hi doosraa netaa
 From what Arun Jaitley spoke, the party's line was fixed
 2-sachche sankat mochakabijeypi kii baat ho yaa phir party netaaon kii, jab bhi sankat aayaa, use dur karne ke liye arun jetali saamne khadey ho jate the
 Whether it is the case of the party's veteran leader LK Advani getting out of the Jain Havala scandal or the modi-shah exit from the Godhra riots and the legal wrangling of the Ishrat jahan-sohrabuddin Sheikh encounter
 har jagah arun jetali ne ahm bhoomika nibhaai
 Not only this, Arun Jaitley fiercely defended when the BJP government was surrounded by policy issues and government decisions
 notebandi, jiesti, rafel aadi muddon par jetali ne blog likhane se lekar tamaam press conference kar faislon kaa bachaav kiya
 3-legal and economic consultant Arun Jaitley, being a veteran lawyer of Supreme Court, was a leader of law
 modi sarkaar kii ore se taiyaar har tarah ke bill kii drafting main arun jetali kii bhoomika rahati thi
 Former Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan has said in a statement issued on the demise that the party used to go ahead with Jaitley's opinion on legal issues
 yahi nahin kanoon ke saath aarthik maamalon main bhi unka samaan adhikaar tha
 This is the reason why PM Modi made him Finance Minister in the first term
 duusare kaarykaal main bhi vah vitt mantri banate
 But due to health reasons, he had decided to keep himself away from politics and government before the 2019 elections
 sutara bataate hai ki yogyata ko dekhte hue party ne unhen bina portpholio ke bhi mantri banane kaa ofer diya tha
 But Jaitley was not tempted for the post
 4- bijepi or duusare dalon ke bich bane rahe setubijapi or sahyogi dalon ke bich arase se arun jetali sethu bane rahe
 He was considered one of the prominent NDA craftsmen during the era of vajpayee-advani
 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main jab bihar main nitish kii jadyu, ram vilaas paswan kii lojpa or bijepi main siton kaa pech fansaa to arun jetali ne hi ise suljhaayaa
 Ram Vilas Paswan himself has said that he had asked BJP President Amit Shah to hand over this work to Arun Jaitley, he will do it well
 kabhi 90 ke dashak main bijpi raajnneetik taur par achhut party maani jaati thi
 Because other political parties from the BJP used to make distances as compared to the Congress
 magar vaajapeyi ne endie kii chhatari tale kai dalon ko saath laakar is dharna ko tod diya
 Accepted BJP
 bataaya jaataa he ki tab arun jetali endie ke shilpakaaron main se ek rahe
 Due to his liberal face and good relations with the leaders of other parties due to his association with the JP movement, he was able to play an important role in the formation of the NDA
 kai baar ahm muddon par vipaksh se bhi samanvay banane main arun jetali bijepi kii madad karte rahe
 5-skilled strategist, election manager It is a different matter that Arun Jaitley always went to Parliament through Rajya Sabha
 jindagi main pehali baar 2014 main amritsar se loksabhaa chunaav lade bhi to haar gaye
 Yet he remained a skilled electoral strategist for the BJP
 har chunaav main bijepi kaa menifesto taiyaar karne main ahm bhoomika nibhaate rahe
 He took over the campaign campaign in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 unhone hi 2014 main yah tay kiya tha ki chunavi postaron main bijepi nahin modi sarkaar kaa naaraa diya jayega
 Only and only Modi will dominate every poster
 kyonki bijepi kii ore se karaae gaye aantarik survey main janata ke bich modi kii apaar lokapriyata kaa pataa chalaa tha
 At that time Jaitley had made a famous statement that this time the people of the country will decide the face of the Prime Minister, not the Parliamentary Board
 2002 or 2008 main gujarat or karnataka rajya kaa prabharee rahete hue unhone bijepi ko safalataa dilaai thi

 The same old style of ghost scare, the same sound you have heard many times before
 
 
 iske alaava kuch seen zarurat se zyada lambey lagane lagate hai, lekin haa, parvati omanakuttan or khaastaur se akshay oberoi ne acchhee acting kii he
 
 
 The film has a dialogue in which the heroine says, "every fear has a moment
 
 
 " lekin dar kaa vah pal mere saamne kabhi aayaa hi nahin, or is lihaaz se meri nazar main 'pizza' ek aivarej film he, lekin phir bhi ek baar ise dekha ja saktaa he, kyonki film kaa plot or kuch 'twists and terns' aapako pasand aa sakate hai
 
 
 My rating for this film is - 2
 5 star

 'adhikari ne kaha, 'aapaki team ke do captain nahin ho sakate or unki media team ek duusare par aarope-pratyarope kaa khel nahin khel saktin
 There is no doubt in the team that there is controversy and a big administrator says that it is the product of media

 It is about the Panchayat elections held in UP
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ke sansadeey kshetra varanasi kaa ek gaanv he jayapur
 Modi has adopted it under the Adarsh gram Yojana
 yahaan mahila pradhan hua karti thim durgavati devi
 This time, both women and men have seats in the village
 durgavati phir chunaav ladane vaali thim, par peeche hat gayi
 Instead his brother-in-law Narayan Singh Patel contested and won
 khabar he ki durgavati ko chunaav na ladane ke liye majaboor kiya gaya
 Narayan said - did not want to contest elections, the English newspaper Indian Express has quoted sources claiming that Durgavati was under family pressure not to contest
 narayan se jab is bare main poocha gaya to bole- meri bhabhi kidilchaspee ab raajnneeti main nahinhai
 So i decided to contest the election and kept the house seat at home
 56 saal ke narayan ravivaar ko maatr 18 vot se jite
 Till now he was working as a representative of Durgavati and was also looking after Pradhani
 logon ne kaha- durgavati ne nomination bhar diya thasthaneey logon kaa kahana he ki durgavathichunaav ladanachahti thim
 She had even filled the nomination paper, but could not file due to family pressure
 lekin narayan bataate hai ki iske do kaaran hai
 'one - it is true that he was not very interested in contesting elections
 doosraa yah ki unhen dar tha ki sthaneey raajnneeti ke kuch muddon ko lekar kuch log unka virodh karenge or vahapadhi-likhi bhi nahinhain
 In such a situation, he asked me to contest elections
 'lekin durgavati se nahin ho pai baeekhbaar ne daawa kiya he ki dabaav kii baat ko lekar usne durgavati se baat karne kii kaaphi koshish kii, lekin unase baat ho hi nahin pai
 By the way, the provision of this village has been with Durgavati's family since 2005
 2005 main unke pati or narayan ke bade bhai jeet narayan 11 vot se jitkar pradhan bane
 But after a year, he died in an accident
 upachunaav main unki patni durgavati jeet gayi
 In 2010, Durgavati won again
 PM bhi hue the durga se prabhavitamodi jayapur ko god lene ke baad 7 november 2014 ko pehali baar yahaan aae the
 Durgavati had also shared the stage with him and the PM said that he was very impressed with this female head
 tab durgavati ne ummid jataai thi ki piem unke gaanv kaa hameshaa dhyaan rakhenge
 By the way, Durgavati is a dropout from school and Narayan a law graduate from BHU
 narayan patel se jab poocha gaya ki kya unhone bijepi kii madad se yah chunaav jeeta, to unhone isse inkaar kar diya
 He said that BJP has not helped him in this election
 unhone yah chunaav apane dam par jeeta he
 Although people say that they would have got votes in the name of Durgavati as well

 duniya ke lakhon research cancer kaa ilaaj dhundne main lage hai
 On the other hand, Assam Health Minister Himant Vishwa Sharma believes that some people suffer from deadly diseases like cancer because they have committed sins in the past and this is justice of God
 mantri ke is tippanee kii raajnneetik dalon or cancer ke marijon ne kadi aalochana kii he
 Despite criticism, Himanta Vishwa Sharma did not apologize for this controversial statement and in response to the tweet by former Finance Minister p Chidambaram, attacked the Congress party
 himant vishwa sharma ne chidambaram par apane bayaan ke galat bayani kaa aarope lagaaya
 According to him, he simply said that in Hinduism, there is a belief that man's sorrows are related to the deeds of the past
 iske saath hi himant vishwa sharma ne chidambaram se poocha ki kya aap yah nahin maanate hai? bilkul aapaki party main mujhe nahin maaloom ki hindu dharm darshan par baat hoti bhi he?sir, please do not distort
 Simply i said that Hinduism believes in karmic law and human sufferings are linked to karmic deficiency of past life
 Don’t you belief that too?of course in your party i do not know whether Hindu philosophy can be discussed at allhttps: / / t
 co / P7CMBIRCYQ — Himanta Biswa Sarma (@himantabiswa) November 22, 2017 Let us know that p Chidambaram criticized the minister's cancerous statement and also criticized him for joining the BJP from the Congress
 himant vishwa sharma ne agast 2015 main congress chhodkar bijepi join kar lee thi
 Let us tell you that Sharma said in the program organized to distribute appointment letters to the teachers in Guwahati, "god punishes us when we sin
 kai baar ham dekhte hai ki yuvaaon ko cancer ho gaya yaa koi yuva haadase kaa shikaar ho gaya
 If you look at the background, you will know that it is justice of God and nothing else
 hamane ishwar ke nyaay kaa saamana karnaa hoga
 Reacting strongly to these comments, Congress leader Debabrata Saikia said, "it is unfortunate that the Health Minister made comments that hurt the sentiments of cancer patients
" unhone yah tippanee saarvajanik rup se kii he, mantri ko iske liye saarvajanik rup se maafee maangani chahie
 On the other hand, the Congress' local unit tweeted and demanded cancer victims and their relatives to take legal and political action against the minister
 vahiin aam aadmi party kii sadsy priti sharma menon ne bhi mantri ke bayaan kii aalochana kii or unhen murkh or ek bura vyakti bataaya
 At the same time AIUDF leader Aminul Islam said that the minister made such a statement because he has failed to stop the cancer in the state
 haalanki rajya ke cancer santhaan dow bi barua cancer institute ke chikitsa adheekshak ne is bayaan ko gambhir nahin mana or kaha ki mantri sharma kaa taatpary vaigyanik kaarnon se nahin balki saamaajik sandarbh main hoga

 According to our basic birthright source, Wikipedia, the wearing & displaying of such headdresses, and other 'indigenous traditional arts and sacred objects' by those who have not earned them - especially by non-natives as fashion or costume - is considered extremely offensive by traditional Native people
 The ‘controversy’ is part of a wider effort by Native American activists to highlight the ongoing cultural genocide against indigenous peoples (especially in the United States and Canada)
 The stupid trend of musicians and festival-goers wearing warbonnets across festivals has led to criticism by Native Americans, apologies by non-natives, and the banning of headdresses as costumes by several big-league music festivals
 We thought this was common knowledge
 Yet, we are here, talking about it being appropriated by a celebrity calendar

 Dr
 Umesh Prasad of Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences, Ranchi said that Laloo Yadav is under depression
 gauratlab he ki in dinon dow
 Lalu is undergoing treatment under the supervision of Umesh Prasad's team
 maaloom ho ki lalu yadav ko discharge karte samay ames ne bhi unke depressant main hone kii baat kaa ullekh kiya tha
 According to Lalujankari, 11 types of diseases are under the grip of Lalu Yadav, along with sugar, eleven other diseases have also taken their grip
 jinamein hai blad pressure, heart, kidney kii beemaari bhi shaamil hai
 Due to these diseases, the doctor has advised them to be cautious in food
 darasal beete kuch dinon se lalu kaa sugar level lagaataar bad rahaa tha
 This was due to Lalu not following the diet chart
 baahar kaa khaanaa khaane se bad rahaa lalu kaa sugarrims ke doctoron ne lalu prasad ke hai sugar kii beemaari par kaaphi mushkil se aanshik niyantran kiya tha
 Although the drug and insulin doses were given to him, Lalu's sugar has increased again
 beete ravivaar ko unka sugar level 185 darj kiya gaya
 This is because Lalu is being given outside food
 darasal jab se lalu ko peing ward main shift kiya gaya harimsse unhen milane vaala bhojan band kar diya gaya he
 Now food is being given to Lalu by personal arrangement, two servants make their food
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki jab se rems se khaanaa band hua he lalu chaaval zyada kha rahe hai
 The servants are preparing and giving them their favorite food
 diet chart ko follow nahin kiya ja rahaa he jiske chalate unka sugar level bad gaya
 However, Lalu's blood sugar level 131 was recorded on Tuesday
 bataa den ki lalu yadav ko pichley buudhvaar ko ranchi institute of medical sciensej (rems) ke privet ward main transfar kar diya gaya tha jisamen unhen ek hajaar rupee pratidin ke hisaab se kamare kaa shulk dena pad rahaa he
 The permission of the jail administration was taken to transfer Lalu to the private ward
 lalu ne rems ke saamaanya ward main chikitsa ke dauraan shikaayat kii thi ki rems parisar main kute bhonkate hai or machhar katate rahete hai jiske chalate unhen neend nahin aati
 With this problem, Laloo had requested the RIMS administration to change his room and shift him to the paying ward
 bataa den ki lalu prasad yadav ne 30 agast ko ranchi kii vishesh sibiai adaalat main sarender kiya, jiske baad unhen aage kaa ilaaj karwaane ke liye ranchi institute of medical sciensej (rems) main bhartee karaayaa gaya tha
 During the hearing on the petition filed against the Delhi Municipal Corporations' schools, the High Court said that the children studying in Municipal Corporation schools do not have proper ABCD
 aakhir aap unhen padhaa kya rahe ho
 The High Court made these remarks when the municipal counsel told the court that the operation of schools is a constitutional provision
 is par hoicourt ne kaha ki, "desh kaa samvidhan bacchon ke liye bhi he
 Many children of 5th class in municipal schools do not even have basic knowledge like ABCD properly
 hoicourt ne vakil ko kaha ki wo khud skool main jaakar asaliyat dekhen
 The Delhi High Court is hearing a petition filed by the Justice for All ngos
 isse pehle hoicourt ne is maamle main nagar nigam ko jamkar fatkaar lagaai thi
 At the same time, the Delhi government was also asked to explore the possibility of taking over the operation of these schools
 is par dilli sarkaar ne bhi hami bhari thi
 It has been told in the petition that there is no drinking water nor toilet facility for the students in the municipal schools
 court ke kehane ke baad yachikakarta ne skulon kaa nirikshan kar apni report main bataaya tha ki nagar nigam skulon kii sthiti bahut hi badahaal he or court me is badahaali ko dikhaane ke liye skulon or chaatro ke photo khinch kar court ko dikhaae gaye the
 The petitioner handed over the photo to the court and even told that some schools are running in the verandah of the baraat ghar
 nagar nigamon ke skulon kii haalat abhi se nahin barason se kharaab he or uski sabase badi vajah bajet kii kami or shikshakon kii hazaron kii taadaad kami hona he
 Now when the schools will not have money to spend and there will be no teachers to teach, then what will be the level of education, it can be easily guessed

 He said that the countries which are going ahead of us in the field of education in the 21st century, they will knock us out of the competition in the coming tomorrow
 aise main hamen hamaare bacchon ko aaj di ja rahi shiksha se behatar shiksha muhaiyaa karaani hogi
 There is nothing more important than this

 The petition has demanded a re-postmortem of the body with videography from the AIIMS board of doctors, which is yet to be decided after hearing on Friday

 kya aapako pataa he ki pehali selfi stick kaa avishkaar kab hua? bhale hi yah pichley kuch saalon se hi chalan main he, lekin hiroshi yueda ne 1980 main hi iskaa avishkaar kar liya tha
 According to the BBC, Ueda developed a selfie stick while working for camera manufacturer Minolta at the time
 yueda khud photography ke shaukeen hai
 The report circulated on the BBC website quoted Ueda as saying, "once when i was at the Louvre Museum in Paris, i asked a child to take a picture of us
" lekin use camera thamakar jaise hi main peeche aayaa vah meraa camera lekar bhaag chukaa tha
 " yueda ne iske baad badhaai ja sakane yogya ek stick kaa nirmaan kiya, jisamen aage kii ore tri pod scru feet kiya
 This extender stick was invented by Ueda for new small cameras
 yueda ne camere ke aage ek chota aaina lagaaya, jisase photo khinchne vaale ko pataa lag sake ki vah kisi tasviir khinch rahaa he
 This extender stick was patented in 1983, but the discovery was not a commercial success, as it was considered unnecessary at the time
 teen dashak baad aaj vahi selfi stick itani lokapriy ho chuki he ki use sangrahalayon, kala vithikaaon evam sammelnon main le jane par roak laga di gai he
 The comments selfi stick ko vartmaan lokapriyata dilaane kaa shrey haalanki canada ke wain from ko diya ja saktaa he
 Wayne developed a hand held stick that could be enlarged in the early 21st century under the name Quick Pod
 sabase rochak yah he ki wain, yueda dwaara khoje gaye extander stick se nawakif the
 Wen mentions Ueda's Extender Stick as a 'pre-existing art' in his patent, but believes the current popularity of selfie sticks is due to the model he developed
 wain kaa kahana he, "yah meri khoj kaa nateeja he, or main iskaa likhit pramaan de saktaa hum
 "selfie sticks developed by Wayne were bought a lot, but other companies have started earning a lot by making cheap sticks with the same design
 bibisi kii website par prasaarit report main yueda ke hawaale se kaha gaya he, "ek baar jab main paris ke louvare sangrahalay me tha to maine ek bachche se hamaari tasviir khinchne ke liye kaha tha
 But as soon as i came back after giving him the camera, he ran away with my camera
 " Ueda then built a extendable stick, which fitted the front pod screw on the front
 yueda ne yah ekstender stick nae chote camaron ke liye izaad kii thi
 Ueda placed a small mirror in front of the camera, allowing the photo-maker to figure out what kind of picture he was taking
 is ekstender stick kaa 1983 main patent karavaaya gaya, lekin is khoj ko vyapaarik safalataa nahin mil saki, kyonki us samay ise anaavashyak khoj mana gaya
 Three decades later, the same selfie stick has become so popular that it has been banned from taking it to museums, art galleries and conferences
 tippaniyan The credit for the current popularity of selfie sticks, however, can be attributed to Wayne Frome of Canada
 wain ne 21veen shatabdi ke shuruyaat main quick pod naam se bada kiye ja sakane yogya ek haath main pakadi jane vaali stick ko viksit kiya
 The most interesting is that Wayne was unaware of the extender stick discovered by Ueda
 wain ne apane patent main yueda kii ekstender stick kaa 'purv prachlit kala' ke rup main zikr kiya he, lekin unka maananaa he ki selfi stick ko mili maujuuda lokapriyata unke dwaara viksit kiye gaye model ke kaaran he
 "this is the result of my discovery," Wayne says, and i can give written evidence of it
 " wain dwaara viksit selfi stick ko khub kharida gaya, lekin usee dizin se saste stick banaakar duusari companiyaan bhi khub kamai karne lagi hai

 The book states that for the newborn William Davenant the poet composed Hussonette 126, addressing 'my dear child'
 is kavita ko aksar homoerotic prem kavita kah diya jaataa he
 This has been claimed due to the similarities in the portraits of Shakespeare and Davenant

 a decision on Asaram, who is jailed in a sexual exploitation case, is coming on Wednesday
 shahjahanpur kii ek dalit naaballig ladki se rape cese main fanse asaram par jodhpur kii special SC / ST court main yah maamla chal rahaa he
 SC / ST court judge Madhusudan Mishra completed the hearing in the case on April 7 and reserved the verdict
 faisla sunaane ke liye unhone 25 april kii taarikh nirdhaarit kii
 But now an important question has arisen that when the whole matter is heard in the court itself, then why is the court being set up in the jail to give the verdict
 or doosraa ahm sawaal yah he ki faisla sunaane ke liye jail main taiyaar ho rahe court kii vyavastha kisi he
 There will be some such arrangement inside the jail, DIG Vikram Singh of Jodhpur Central Jail said that the court has been fully prepared inside the jail
 faisla sunaane ke dauraan court ke chuninda karmchaariyon or donon pakshon ke vakil ke alaava kisi anya ko entry nahin milegi
 On the day of the hearing, judges, court staff, lawyers from both sides, security officers and jail officers will be present
 jail ke andar or baahar bhi suraksha ke kade intjaam rahenge
 He said that every person coming to the court to hear the verdict will be closely monitored
 court ke puure ilaake ko sil kar diya gaya he
 This court, which was built for terrorists, has given the hall behind the barrack number 2 of Asaram inside the Jodhpur Central Jail as a court room to pass judgment on Asaram
 bataa den ki jodhpur kaa yah central jail indian mujahidin ke aatankiyon ke liye taiyaar kiya gaya tha, jisamen ab tak aatanki pesh hote aae hai
 However, Asaram has already appeared in this court
 bich main jab asaram ke samarthak court main bavaal kar rahe the, tab asaram kii sunwaayee pichley dinon video conferencing ke jariye isi court se kii ja rahi thi
 It is said that 31 years ago, the hearing of Akali leader Gurcharan Singh Tohra was held in Jodhpur Temporary Court at this place in the Central Jail of Jodhpur
 media ko nahin milegi entriasaram par aane vaale court ke is faisle kii pal-pal kii khabar deshavaasiyon tak pahunchane ke liye patrakaron ke pravesh kii anumati maangi gai thi, lekin jail prashasan ne suraksha kii drushti se media se jude kisi vyakti ko jodhpur centralgel main pravesh kii anumati nahindi he
 The district administration has made elaborate security arrangements in view of the decision on Asaram, which has deployed 10,000 security personnel, turned into a Jodhpur jail fort
 jail ke baahar asaram ke bhakton kii bheed na jute, iske bhi kade intjaam kiye gaye hai
 Tight security arrangements have been made inside and outside the jail
 jail ke baahar estf ke jawan or rapid ection force ke jawan chaaron taraf bairicading karke tainaat hai
 While inside the jail, the security guards of the prison will be guarded
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki is puure maamle main jodhpur or jodhpur ke aas-paas 10 hajaar se zyada pulicekarmi lagaae gaye hai
 There will be no entry day in Jodhpur throughout the day, ie on 25 April, there will be no entry in Kojodhpur
 shahar ke sabhi railway steshnon par khufia agencia tainaat he
 Police forces have been deployed at Jodhpur railway stations for security
 jodhpur main badi sankhya main asaram ke bhakton ke jutane kii ashanka ko dekhte hue puure shahar kii nakaabandi kar di gai he
 Jodhpur till 31 April
 is vajah se jail main lagegaa court7 april ko jaise hi court kaa faisla aayaa rajasthan kii vasundhara raaje sarkaar ne bina deree kiye rajasthan hoicourt main hai court main apil kar di ki asaram maamle par faisla jail ke andar court lagaakar sunaaya jaae
 In fact, the Vasundhara government is afraid that in the event of a decision against Asaram, the supporters of Asaram should not create a chaotic situation in the state
 saath hi agar asaram ko doshi qaraar dete hue sajaa sunai jaati he to jodhpur main panchakula jaisi hinsak sthiti ban sakati he
 On the back of his appeal, the Vasundhara government presented an intelligence report before the High Court
 intelligence report main jataai gai yah ashankadarasal intelligence agencys ko aisi suchanaaen mili hai ki agar asaram ke khilaaf faisla aata he to uske hajaaron samarthak utpaat machaa sakate hai
 According to the Intelligence report, there is every possibility that the general public life in Jodhpur may be severely affected and the peace system may deteriorate and the supporters of Asaram may commit violence and challenge the law and order
 isse saarvajanik sampatti ko baari nuksaan pahunch saktaa he or jaan-maal ke nuksaan kii bhi ashanka he
 Still acquitted, will remain in jail Keeping in mind the appeal and intelligence report of the Asaramvasundhara government, the Rajasthan High Court directed the Jodhpur SC / ST Court that a decision in the Asaram case should be pronounced by making a court inside the Jodhpur Central Jail, where Asaram Is closed agar aap is saal baba barfaani ke darshan karnaa chaahate hai, to kam se kam ek maheene tak sharaab se dur rahanaa padegaa or lagaataar vyaayaam karnaa padegaa
 The Amarnath Shrine Board has done this advisory on the yatra
 isamen kaha gaya he ki chunki amarnath kii gupha kaaphi oonchai par he, isiilie darshan karne waalon ko ek maheene tak paanch kilometre har rose chalane kii aadat daalani chahie
 It has been written in the advisory that along with the habit of walking, attention should also be paid to the respiratory process, so all people desirous of philosophy should also do respiratory exercises
 tippaniyan This year, the Amarnath Yatra will start from June 29 to August 7
 pavitra gupha 14000 foot kii oonchai par sthit he, jiske chalate yatriyon ko saans lene main kathinaayee kaa saamana karnaa pad saktaa he
 So they should therefore keep them together with a small cylinder of oxygen
 oonchai sambandhi dikkat hone par samay se ilaaj na milane se lakva maarane, ankhon kii roshni jane kaa dar hota he or kuch hi ghante main yah jaanaleva sabit ho saktaa he
 Alcohol, smoking and caffeinated beverages are also advised not to drink during the trip
 yatra ke liye registration kii prakriya shuru ho chuki he
 The security of the Amarnath Yatra will be a major challenge for the agencies this year
 pichley saal tamaam vaadon ke baavjood ghati main amarnath yatriyon ke vaahanon par patharav kiya gaya tha
 Also attacked truck drivers carrying essential goods in the valley
 pichley saal aatanki burhan vaani ke maare jane ke baad do din tak yatra ko roak diya gaya tha
 After this, the journey was definitely restored, but it showed a continuous impact on the journey
 yahi kaaran tha ki yatra 2 lakh 20 hajaar shraddhaluon ke aankade tak simat gai
 This year Baba Barfani is expected to grow in size
 is saal amarnath yatra 29 june se shuru hokar 7 agast tak chalegi
 The holy cave is situated at an altitude of 14000 feet, due to which the travelers can face difficulty in breathing
 isliye unhen isliye unhen oxigen kaa chota silinder saath main rakhana chahie
 Due to altitude problem, due to lack of timely treatment, there is a fear of paralysis, loss of eyesight and in a few hours it can prove to be fatal
 yatra ke dauraan sharaab, dhumrapaan or caffeinayus peya padaarth nahin pine kii bhi hidaayat di gai he
 The registration process for the journey has started
 amarnath yatra kii suraksha is saal agenciyon ke liye ek badi chunauti hogi
 Last year, despite all the promises, vehicles of Amarnath pilgrims were pelted in the valley
 saath hi ghati main jaruri saamaan le jane vaale trek chaalkon par bhi hamale kiye
 The yatra was halted for two days after the terrorist Burhan Wani was killed last year
 iske baad yatra behaal to jarur hui, lekin yatra par iskaa nirantar asar dikhaa
 This was the reason that the yatra was reduced to a figure of 2 lakh 20 thousand devotees
 is saal baba barphani kaa aakaar bada hone kii ummid he

 The ASI had excavated at the behest of the High Court
 report ke mutabik, vivaadit dhaanche ke thik neeche ek badi sanrachana mili jo uttar bharat ke mandiron jaisi he
 Constructions continued here from the 10th century until the construction of the structure
 10veen shatabdi se pehle uttar vaidic kaal tak kii pratimaaon or anya chizon ke avshesh mili hai
 The Supreme Court held that the ASI report is not a simple opinion
 hycourt jaj ke kehane par khudaai hui
 In the Supreme Court, the Hindu god is considered a minor and the property of a minor cannot be taken away
 ram janmasthan swayan devtaa he, use sthanantarit nahin kiya ja saktaa
 The structure demolished on 6 December 1992 cannot be considered a mosque according to Islamic law
 masjid ke liye jaruri shart he ki iskaa waakif jameen kaa maalik hona chahie jabaki babar maalik nahin tha
 He never went to Ayodhya
 masjid main kisi tarah kii murti, chitra yaa jivit cheez athwa jaanavar, phool, pattee murtiyon aadi nahin hotin jabaki janmasthan par devataaon kii murtiyon thim
 The remains found in the excavation of ASI also confirm the temple there
 vivaadit dhaanche ke neeche mandir jaisi vishaal sanrachana mili he
 The excavations had statues of kalash, lotus and deities, which proves that there was a first temple which was broken into a mosque and the contents of the temple were used to build the mosque
 hindu vriksh, pahaad, surya, nadi, sabhi kii puja karte hai or unhen devtaa maanate hai
 The smallest particle discovered in the world has also been called God particle
 vahaan bhagwaan ram kaa janm hua tha isliye vah sthaan swayan main devtaa he or use nyaayik vyakti mana jaae
 Lord Rama was born in Ayodhya itself and historical, documentary and archaeological evidence was presented to prove that Rama is the birthplace
 saat videshi 19veen shatabdi main pehali baar ise babari masjid kaha gaya
 Before this there is no documentary evidence of being called Babri Masjid
 muslim paksh kah rahaa he ki vahaan idgah thi to kya masjid idgah ko todakar banaai gai thi
 Ayodhya has many mosques, the birthplace cannot be changed
 supreme court main muslim pakshadhaanche ke neeche vishaal mandir nahin tha
 Babur did not build a mosque by breaking the temple
 hinduon ne 1934 main masjid par hamalaa kiya, 1949 main ve jabaran andar ghuse, 1992 main masjid dhaha di or ab ve log court se adhikaron kii raksha kii guhaar laga rahe hai
 The case was first filed on behalf of Lord Ram in 1989, in which the ownership of the entire land was sought
 devtaa nyaayik vyakti hota he lekin khud cese nahin lard saktaa
 When the Nirmohi Akhara exists as a serviceman, then a separate case has no meaning
 ayodhya main panchakosi or chaudaa kosi parikrama ko sakshya nahin mana ja saktaa
 Based on heard and heard by foreign travelers and historians

 The Hindu side should prove what they had right there before December 22-23, 1949 (when the idols were placed inside)
 nirmohi akhaada baahar chabutare par puja karata tha, andar nahin
 The right of Muslims inside
 janmasthan ko devtaa or nyaayik vyannti bananaa anuchit
 If this happens, the rights of other parties and religious beliefs will end
 babari masjid ke daawey ke paksh main imam ke vetan or 1934 main hue dange main masjid ke kuch toote hisse kii marammat or muaavje se sambandhit kagajaat court main rakhe
 Babur was the sovereign ruler and the court could not analyze his work
 samprabhu shaasha jameen kaa maalik hota he or uske kaam ko gaiyrkanoonee nahin kaha ja saktaa
 The High Court of Appeal and the plea against the High Court verdict held that the disputed land included a portion which is considered to be the birthplace of Rama but did not grant the right of worship
 ye baat virodhabhasi he
 The right to worship is void without a permanent ban on the removal of the idol
 yah dharmik swatantraaa ke adhikaar kaa ulanghan
 Hindus consider the entire land to be a deity and the rule of partition will not apply to the deity
 hycourt kaa jameen kaa bantwaaraa karne kaa bahumat kaa faisla supreme court ke vibhinn faislon main di gai devtaa kii avadharana ke khilaaf he
 The Muslim High Court of Allahabad has called the birthplace of Lord Rama under the main dome even though there was no evidence of it
 yah kahana galat he ki 1949 ke pehle dashakon se masjid parisar main hindu or musalmaan donon kaa sanyukt kabja tha
 The ASI report did not say that the temple was demolished and the mosque built
 hycourt yah samaj nahin paaya ki samvidhan ke anuchhed 25 or 26 me sabhi logon kii aasthaa or vishwaas ko samaan sangrakshan mila he
 Ownership cannot be decided on the basis of faith and trust

 Why did Kumble get upset? Kohli took the bowling in the final after not accepting the decision of the meeting, wrote, "I have always believed that the position of the coach is very important in the team and he was included in the team's strategy
 sachin ne likhaa tha ki kapil dev kii soch thi ki team ko captain ke hawaale karnaa chahie or coach ko ranneeti banane main hissedaar nahin bananaa chahie
 Which also affected his captaincy

 Home Minister Bala Bachchan said that there is a discussion on the budget, on the demands for grants, so that the mlas can talk about their area
 sarkaar par koi khatra nahin he, aap wo baat chhod dijie
 On the other hand, Higher Education Minister Jeetu Patwari said that democracy is the main part of the party to make rules and regulations for its mlas
 narendra modi ji ne apane saansadon ke liye vip jari kiya he bajet ko lekar har party is tarah ke adhikaar kaa istemaal karti he
 It is positive, there is nothing wrong with it

 sikkim sarhad par china kii dadagiri ke bich 'ajtak' kii team ne uttrakhand main tibet se sate china border ke halaat kaa jayja liya he
 Mana in the frontier Chamoli district is the last village in the border
 chamoli jile se tibet jane ke liye 3 darre hai, niti, mana or badahoti ke aage tun jhin laa
 Prior to the 1962 war, it was a trade route between India and Tibet
 mana main sena or itibipi kii unit tainaat he jabaki mana se aage 40 se 50 kilometre itibipi kii forward post he
 Although there has been no attempt of infiltration from the Chinese side in the area of mana for the past several years, the ITBP and the army do not want to give any chance
 itibipi ke jawan leh se lekar mana, sikkim or arunachal main 8 hajaar se lekar 18 hajaar feet tak ke oonche pahaado par tainaat hai
 In such a situation, ITBP snowmen have to be always ready for the mountain warfare
 is maukey par hamanen janaa ki kaise jawan vipareet paristhitiyon main seemaa par mustaid rahete hai
 In Mana, patrolling and special mountain warfare training of ITBP personnel is conducted
 mana ke paas joshimath main maujuud itibipi ke mountairing or sking santhaan main ye khaas training di jaati he
 Executing an action against the enemy by climbing a 70-foot-high upright rock is a left-handed game of the ITBP jawan
 note ropave kii madad se jawan oonchi chattan par chadhate hai
 It is very important to be physically and mentally strong for this particular training
 chamoli jile main mana, niti, malari or badahoti ghati kii darjanon forward post par itibipi ke jawan tainaat hai
 To reach many posts, one has to walk 6 to 8 kilometers
 haalanki pichley varshon se in ilaakon main samrik road banane kaa kaam tej hua he
 ITBP jawans patrol the mountains and monitor every movement of China
 10 javaanon kii tukdi hathiyaaron or jaruri sajo-saamaan se las hokar oonchi chattaanon ko paar karte hue aage badhati he
 On June 3, 2017, in China, two helicopters were stirred up at Barahoti in Chamoli district
 chamoli kaa yah ilaaka bharat-china border ke paas sthit he
 This is the fourth incident of intransigence in the Indian border of the Chinese Army in the last 3 months
 adhikariyon ke mutabik, donon helicopter kareeb 5 minute bhartiya seemaa main rahe
 It is believed that he has also done photography of Indian areas, so he may have come to monitor the Indian Post
 badahoti chamoli jile kii malari ghati par tibet seemaa par ek dhalua ghaas kaa maidan he
 To reach Barahoti, one has to go from Joshimath via Malari
 somna tak ab motor maarg ban gaya he
 Barahoti is about 6 kilometers from Somna, one kilometer behind this ground, the indo-tibetan Border Police is stationed at Rimkhim
 niti ghati se gyaldhung hote hue tibbt pahunche to pataa chalaa ki yahaan bhi seemaa se 6 kilometre peeche tak sadak nirmaan ho chukaa he
 It is difficult to reach Tibet by means of policy and policy
 lekin badahoti hote hue tun- jhin-laa ke raste tibet aurkailash maansarovar janaa sabase sugamahai
 Before the indo-china War of 1962, most traders used to go to Tibet via Barahoti
 yah rasta keval chamoli ke 3 darron main se hi nahin balki desh ke kisi bhi darre se maansarovar pahunchane kaa sabase najdiki rasta he
 Recently, China had also stopped the journey of Mansarovar via Sikkim
 mana ke paas badahoti kaa rasta maansarovar jane kaa sabase najdiki or saral rasta he
 But being disputed, neither trade nor Mansarovar Yatra route is opening from Tun-jhin-la
 is raste se ek din main kailash maansarovar panhucha ja saktaa he jabaki pithauragarh se 6 din lagate hai
 The people living near the border of Mana and the ITBP personnel are ready to avenge the 1962 blight of China between the conflict with China on the Sikkim border
 rakshabandhan bhai-bahan ke sneh kaa parv he
 On the occasion of Rakshabandhan, where the sisters are wearing a sutra on their brother's wrist and taking a pledge to protect them
 vahiin bihar ke munger main police do pahiyaa vaahan chalaane waalon ke haath par raksha sutara baandhakar gandhigiri kar rahi he
 The sight of Munger's roads was somewhat different on the day of Rakshabandhan
 jagah-jagah police kaa jamaavada laga he
 Two-wheelers are being stopped and police officers put defense in their hands
 pehali najar main to vaahan chalaane vaale dar jate hai ki kahin checking to nahin chal rahi lekin kalai par raksha sutara baandhe jane par pataa chalata he ki ye to gandhigiri ho rahi he
 The police are doing Gandhigiri because they must use helmets while driving two wheelers
 munger ke aarakshi adheekshak ashish bharti or jamalpur ke rail espi swapna meshram ne sanyukt rup se is kaarykram ko munger kii sadakon par anjaam diya
 The decision to adopt Gandhigiri was decided by the two police officers, as there was no decrease in the number of Binahelmetwahns in Munger and Jamalpur
 in donon kii soch ye thi ki niyam or kanoon ke sahare jis kaam ko anjaam tak nahin pahunchaaya ja saktaa use gandhigiri ke sahare samajhakar anjaam tak pahunchaaya ja saktaa he
 This move of the police was also appreciated by the drivers and vowed to drive only by wearing a helmet from the front
 rail mantri piyush goyal ne pichley saal 18 june 2018 ko bijness standard ko die ek intervyuu main kaha tha ki 2019 kii aakiri timahi main jidipi kii dar 10 pratishat ho jayega
 Thereafter, on 5 February this year, Piyush Goyal had told the Economic Times that 7 in FY20
 5 pratishat jidipi rahane kii ummid he
 Piyush Goyal himself has 2 in GDP in a year
 5 pratishat kii kami kar di
 Real GDP then and 2
 5 pratishat kam ho gai
 That is, it was halved as much as a year ago
 2019 kii aakiri timahi main kisi ne 10 pratishat jidipi dekhi? 2020 kii pehali timahi main 5 ho gai he
 GDP is 5 today, tomorrow it may be 7, but with the statements of how people are being made monkeys, you can see for yourself
 usee tarah notebandi ke samay jidipi ko lekar die gaye bayanon ko dekhie
 At that time whatever was said in the name of far-reaching results was not completed
 jo thode samay ke liye thodaa bahut hua wo bagair notebandi ke bhi ho saktaa tha
 The best effort is to manage today's headline
 badi baat karo jisase lagaataar log farzi ummid main rahen
 Cover your adventures in the name of hope
 ab koi nahin poochhega ki das pratishat kii jidipi aane ke asaar kya hai?pehle to goyal sahab graphix chart banaakar bataa rahe the
 We would also make a chart about five percent
 ab unki team koi chart nahin banayega yaa banaaegi to sabit karne ke liye ki kaise ham china se aage hai
 Telling India of China topping it
 aap sab bhul jate hai
 It is obvious
 lekin thodaa peeche laut kar jaaiye or dekhie ki ye kya bayaan dete hai
 i have put here some screen shots of the old tweet by the Prime Minister and Piyush Goyal
 adhyayan karen
