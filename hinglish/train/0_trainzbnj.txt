 Because we also have atom bombs
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki aap ajeeb-ajeeb baaten karnaa band kariye or jaish-e-mohammad or lashkar-e-taiyabba ko khatm kiijie
 On Saturday, AIMIM chief Owaisi told Pakistani PM Imran Khan in a blunt manner that 'pakistan's wazir-e-azam spoke about Tipu Sultan
 o ho abba
 Tipu Sultan was not an enemy of the Hindus
 vah unke sultanate ke dushman the, chaahe hindu ho yaa koi majahab ke hon
 Just read this too
 aap apni assembly main baithkar tipu sultan or bahadur shah jafar kii baat karte hai
 They do strange things
 atom bam, phulaan bam
 
 
 Not here Is not here? But what is the matter aap jaraa jaish-e-shayatin or lashkar-e-shayatin ko khatm karo
 ' # WATCH Asaduddin Owaisi, AIMIM: Pak PM talked of Tipu Sultan & Bahadur Shah Zafar in his assembly, Tipu Sultan was not enemy of Hindus but adversary of the enemies of his sultanate
 He talks about atom bomb, it's weird
 
 we've it too
 Handle your lashkar-e-shaitaan & jaish-e-shaitaan

 com / qv5mun908evahim, hyderabad main ek sabha ko sambodhit karte hue ovaisi bhaajapa par bhi hamalaa bolaa
 Owaisi said that if i am a Muslim, you might doubt whether he is loyal or anti national, but listen to one of my talks
 agar bijepi yah kah rahi he ki meraa booth sabase majboot to main kah rahaa hum meri sarhad majboot to meraa desh majboot
 Earlier, on the Pulwama terror attack, Owaisi attacked Pak PM Imran Khan
 pulavama aatanki hamale kii ninda karte hue ovaisi ne kaha tha ki is hamale ke peeche pakistan kaa haath he
 This attack is related to Pakistan
 pakistani sarkaar, pakistani sena or iesai kii yojana ke anusaar is hamale ko anjaam diya gaya
 Explain that 40 CRPF jawans were martyred in the terror attack in Pulwama, which has been claimed by the terrorist organization jaish-e-mohammed
 asaduddin ovaisi ne kaha tha ki 'is hamale kaa link pakistan se he
 The attack was carried out according to the plan of the Pakistani government, Pakistani army and ISI
 unhone kaha ki jin logon ne hamaare 40 javaanon kii hatya kii he or uski jimmedaari lee he, ve jaish-e-mohammad nahin jaish-e-shaitan hai
 He further added that 'mohammed's soldier does not kill any person, he is kind to humanity
 tum jaish-e-shaitan, jaish-e-iblis hai
 Exist Azhar, you are not a maulana, you are a disciple of the devil
 yah lashkar-e-taiyaba nahin he, yah lashkar-e-shaitan he
 In fact, on 14 February, the CRPF convoy was going from Jammu to Srinagar
 is kafile main kareeb 78 gaadiyaan thim or 2500 jawan shaamil the
 At the same time, overtaking from the left came a car loaded with explosives and hit the bus of CRPF
 aatankwaadi ne jis car se takkar maari thi, usamen kareeb 60 kilo visphotak the
 Due to this, the explosion became so fatal that 40 soldiers were killed in it

 aakraamak ravaiya apanaae hue hai rahul, har jagah ja rahe hai, logon se baatcheet kar rahe hai or media se bhi
 Earlier, Rahul used to be angry at seeing the media
 rahul chuttee par gaye the, kahaan gaye the abhi tak pataa nahin kar paaya hum, keval atakalein hi lagaate rahe magar jahaan bhi gaye acha hua he
 The Congress has benefited from this
 sansad ho yaa baahar rahul ne aisa hamalaa bolaa he ki log ab baaten karne lage hai
 Alam is that they attack the government and the government defends itself
 sarkaar kii taraf se mantriyon ko jabaab dena padataa he
 The atmosphere has become such that Rahul has been successful to some extent in proving this government to be a suitbut government while talking about farmers
 pehle rahul kaa bhaashan suniye, likhaa hua hota tha
 But now they come prepared and speak
 pehle saamne kii bheed se samvaad nahin hota tha, ab wo bhi hone laga he, jumale bolne lage hai
 Rahul was also seen in his color at the NSUI session
 pradhanmantri kii videsh yatraaon par chutki lee or logon ko yah bhi bataaya ki manmohan singh pradhanmantri narendra modi se milane kab gaye
 Rahul Gandhi, Manmohan Singh and Modi ji discussed the economy of the country
 yah mulaakaat isliye bhi mahatvarpun ho gai kyonki manmohan singh ne modi sarkaar kii arthvyavastha par tikhi tippanee kii thi
 Manmohan Singh, while airing the make in India of this government, said that this is the policy of his government and only the name is new
 phir manmohan singh ne kaha ki rirjav bank ke garvanar or vitt mantri ke salaahkaar kii chintaa is arthvyavastha ke liye jaij he us par bhi dhyaan dene kii jarurat he
 Now when a man like Manmohan Singh speaks on the country's economy, it is prudent to take it seriously
 or shaayad pradhanmantri ne unhen bula kar acha hi kiya
 The comments darasal modi sarkaar ke ek saal puure hone par congress ne ranneeti ke tahat acchhee takkar di he
 The government swung into action when Rahul met the retired army men on a rank one pension
 ab lagata he ki is maamle main shaayad kuch ho jaae
 a fight is also going on in Amethi where Priyanka has taken charge
 ab rahul gandhi ke liye chunauti he ki wo party main kya karte hai kitna badlaav laa pate hai
 Because the character of the party talking about farmers, laborers and the Akaliyat is very feudalistic
 inaki baat keval gandhi parivaar hi kar rahaa he baaki congressi kahaan hai
 People will also be interested in which people will be in Rahul's team
 shuruyaat to rahul ne thik kii he magar kya wo ise anjaam tak le ja pate hai, isi par ham sab kii nigahen hongi

 First listen to Rahul's speech, it was written
 magar ab wo taiyaari kar ke aate hai or bolte hai
 Earlier there was no communication with the front crowd, now they have started happening, jumle has started speaking
 enesyuai ke adhiveshan main bhi rahul apane rang main dikhe
 Quipped on the Prime Minister's foreign visits and also told the people when Manmohan Singh went to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 bakaul rahul gandhi, manmohan singh or modi ji ne desh kii arthvyavastha par charchaa kii
 This meeting also became important because Manmohan Singh had made a sharp comment on the Modi government's economy
 manmohan singh ne is sarkaar kii mek in india kii hawa nikaalte hue kaha ki yah unheen kii sarkaar kii niti he or keval naam nayaa he
 Then Manmohan Singh said that the concern of the Governor of the Reserve Bank and advisor to the Finance Minister is justified for this economy, it also needs attention
 ab jab manmohan singh jaisaa vyakti desh kii arthvyavastha par bole to use gambhirtha se lenaa hi samajhadaari he
 And perhaps the Prime Minister did well by calling him
 tippaniyan In fact, after the completion of one year of the Modi government, the Congress has given a good competition under the strategy
 rahul ne jab ek rank ek pension par sena ke ritaryad logon se mulaakaat kii to sarkaar harakat main ai
 Now it seems that something might happen in this case
 ek ladaai amethi main bhi chal rahi he jahaan priyanka ne morcha sambhaal rakhaa he
 Now the challenge for Rahul Gandhi is how much change he can make in the party
 kyonki kisaan, majdoor or akaliyat kii baat karne vaali party kaa charitra bada hi samantvaadi he
 Only Gandhi family is talking about them, where are the other Congressmen? logon ko is baat main bhi dilchaspee hogi ki rahul kii team main koun koun se log honge
 Initially, Rahul has corrected it, but whether he is able to take it to the end, we will all have our eyes on it

 roosi america lekhika aayan randka upanyaas he, ‘fountain head’ or usamen ek chaatr he- howard rwork
 The story of this novel begins from here that it is being expelled from the university
 wo architekchar kii padhai kar rahaa he or kuch aise dizin hai jo uske shikshak ko pasand nahin aate, wo bilkul alag kism ke dizin banaata he
 The college dean tells Howard Roark, "if you have made these designs, who will allow you to build such a building?" The dean says that what you have got built, it is so new that who will allow you to build such a building? Roark says that the question is not who will make me, the question is who will stop me
 upar ke paragraph kii ye line roosi-america upanyaaskaar, darshanik, naatakkaar aayan rand ke kaaljayi upanyaas ‘da fountainhed’ se hai
 Rand established his theory of Objectivism in 1943 by writing this famous novel
 aayan rand kaa janm 2 farvari 1905 ko rus ke saint petersburg main hua tha
 Two years after learning to read by himself at the age of six, he found his first fictional hero in a children's French magazine
 hero kii ek aisi chhavi jo taumr unke dilo-dimag par chaspaan rahi
 At the age of nine, he decided to make fiction-based writing his career

 In the final year of high school, when he read American history, he accepted America as his ideal for the imagination of independent countries
 jab unka parivaar kreemia se lautaa, to unhone darshanashastra or itihaas kii padhai ke liye uniwarsity of petrograd main daakhila le liya
 After graduating in 1924, he saw the freedom of knowing everything coming to an end and that gradually the university was ruled by communist thugs
 niraashaa ke in dinon main unhen vienna ke opera or pashchim kii filmein yaa naatakon se hi sukun miltaa tha
 In the last days of 1925, he sought permission to leave the Soviet Union to visit America to visit relatives
 unhone haalanki soviet adhikariyon ko yahi bataaya ki unka yah pravaas chota hoga, vaastaviktaa yah thi ve rus waapas na lautne kaa pakkaa nishchay kar chuki thim

 Ion Randco in Hollywood the very day Cecil B
 dimil ne studio ke daravaaje par khadaa dekh liya
 He gave Ayan a lift to his film 'the King of Kings' and then gave him the job of an extra and then a script reader
 studio main agle ek saptaah main aayan kii mulaakaat abhinayta frank o' conor se hui jinase unhone 1929 main shaadi kii
 Their marital bond lasted until o'connor's death after 50 years
 aayan ne 1932 main universal studio ko apana pehla screenple 'red pon' bechaa or 16 janvari kii raat apane pehle naatak ko stage par dekha
 It was produced first in Hollywood and then in Broadway
 unka pehla nowell, ‘ve da living’, taiyaar to 1934 main hi ho gaya tha, lekin kai publisharon ke inkaar ke baad ise 1936 main america main ‘da macmillan’ company or england main ‘cacels and company’ ne prakashit kiya
 The novel that threw the most light on his life was based on his days under autocratic Soviet rule
 1937 main samoohwaad virohilaghu upanyaas 'antham' likhane ke liye chota sa brake lene ke baad unhone 1935 main ‘da fountanhed’ likhnaa shuru kiya
 In the character of architect Howard Roark, he introduced in his writing the kind of hero whose core goal was his writing
 ek adarsh vyakti, aisa vyakti jaisaa 'vah ho saktaa he or hona chahie
 After the refusal of 12 publishers, the Bobsameril Company finally took up the task of publishing 'the Fountainhead'
 1943 main prakashit hone ke baad maukhik prachaar ne hi do saal ke bheetar ise best celler bana diya
 It also identified Ayaan as an advocate of individualism
 aayan rand ne 1943 main hollywood main vaapasi ke baad ‘da fountainhed’ kaa screenple likhaa
 Due to the restrictions imposed due to the war, it was prepared only in 1948
 haal walis productions ke liye part-time screen riter ke taur par kaam karte hue unhone 1946 main apane mukhya upanyaas 'atlas shragd' kaa lekhan aarambh kiya
 Returning to New York in 1951, he devoted all his time to completing the novel
 1957 main prakashit 'atlas shragd'unki sabase badi uplabdhi rahi or yah unka antim kaalpanik upanyaas bhi rahaa
 In this novel, he transformed his most distinct philosophy into a mind-boggling mystical tale that covered ethics, metaphysics, epistemology, politics, economics and sex
 khud ko multah kaalpanik lekhan karne vaali maanane ke baad bhi unhen is baat kaa ahsaas hua ki adarsh kaalpanik paatro kii rachana ke liye unhen aise darshanik siddhant pahchaanane honge, jinase aise log sambhav ho saken
 Subsequently, Ion Rand wrote and lectured on his philosophy, Objectivism, which can be seen in 'A Philosophy for Living on Earth'
 1962 se 1976 ke dauraan unhone apni hi patrikaon (periodicals) kaa sampadan or prakaashan kiya
 The contents of six books on his meditation were collected from here and were also used for use in culture
 aayan rand kaa 6 march 1982 ko neuyork shahar main unke apartment main nidhan ho gaya
 The books Ion Rand published during his life are still published today
 har saal inaki hajaaron pratiyaan bikati hai

 argedy ke eashtriya pravaktaa or rajyasabha saansad manoj jha ne bataaya ki chunaav se jude saare faisle lalu prasad yadav hi lenge
 However Lalu Prasad Yadav is convicted in the fodder scam case and is a prisoner of Hotwar jail in Ranchi
 abhi unka ilaaj ranchi ke rems aspataal main chal rahaa he
 It is believed that Lalu Yadav will decide which party will contest on how many seats in the Grand Alliance
 vaise bhi mahagathabandhan ke sabhi dal ke netaa ranchi kaa chakkar laga rahe hai
 On Saturday, Loktantrik Janata Dal President Sharad Yadav met Lalu Yadav
 dedh ghante tak chali is mulaakaat ke baad sharad yadav ne kaha ki jaldi hi mahagathbandhan kaa swaroop saamne aayegaa
 Earlier, we have also met Lalu several times with party president Jitan Ram Manjhi and Lok Samta Party president Upendra Kushwaha
 vaise bhi lalu prasad yadav hi argedy ke sabhi faisle par apni muhar lagaate rahe hai
 Now, if the party has authorized it, it is also being interpreted that the symbol of the candidates will be signed by Lalu Prasad Yadav
 pehle aisa mana ja rahaa tha ki iske liye party kahin purv mukhyamantri rabari devi ko adhikrut karegi, kyonki jail main rahakar simbel par hastakshar ko kanoonee manyata milane main aadchan aaye
 But Rajya Sabha MP Manoj Jha said that when he became a candidate for the Rajya Sabha elections in 2018, the symbol was signed by RJD President Lalu Prasad Yadav
 us samay bhi lalu yadav jail main hi the

 Earlier, Karnataka minister DK Shivakumar, considered a troubleshooter, has made the last move to save the coalition government
 baagi vidhayakon ko raji karne ke liye siem kumaraswami ke sthaan par kisi or mukhyamantri banaaya ja saktaa he
 Congress stalwart DK Shivakumar says the JDS is ready to make any kind of sacrifice to save the government

 loksabhaa chunaav main haar ke baad dilli main congress netritv kamjor hua to vahiin karnataka main siddharmaiya gut sakriy ho gaya
 Many of the 13 mlas who resigned from the Congress belong to the Siddaramaiah faction
 yahi vajah he ki istipha dene vaale chaar vidhayakon ne kaha tha ki yadi siddharmaiya mukhyamantri banate hai to ve apana istipha waapas le lenge
 ST Somashekhar, b Basavaraju, n Muniratna and Ramalinga Reddy are the prominent names among the rebel Congress mlas who have made Siddaramaiah the CM
 dilachasp baat yah he isamen sabase bada naam ramalinga reddy kaa he jo siddharmaiya sarkaar main grih mantri rah chuke hai
 He was not given the position of minister this time
 ramalinga reddy ke saath kam se kam teen vidhayak hai jo ramalinga reddy gut ke hai jo is samay unke saath hai
 Apart from this Ramesh is doing Jarkheholi
 gokak se vidhayak ramesh se mantri pad chin kar unke sage bhai satish jarakeholi ko de diya gaya tha
 Ramesh was angry with the party ever since and he has resigned
 jarakeholi bhi siddharmaiya ke kareebi maane jate hai
 Explain that the congress-jds government currently has a figure of 100 by removing the rebel mlas, which is far from the majority
 floor test se pehle dike sivakumar ne siddharmaiya ko siem banane kaa jo daanv chalaa he, uske baad agar baagi vidhayak maanate hai to karnataka main satta bachane kaa rasta bhi saaf ho saktaa he
 Karnataka Legislative Assembly (total No

 On the other hand, 3 out of 37 JDS mlas have resigned
 iske alaava do nirdaleey aar shankar or ech nagesh bhi kumaraswami sarkaar ke saath nahin hai
 In this way, the Congress currently has 65 mlas, including the Speaker, and the JDS has 34, including 99
 iske alaava ek basapa ke vidhayak kaa samarthan milane ke baad 100 kaa aankada puraa hota he
 At the same time, the BJP has 105 mlas and has the support of an independent MLA
 aise main siddharmaiya ko siem banane ke prastaav ko agar congress baagi maanate hai to floor test se pehle vidhansabha main pahunchate hai to phir number game palat saktaa he
 However, the rebel mlas are currently in Mumbai

 In the Kumbh region of Prayagraj, the Supreme Religion Parliament convened by Jagatguru Shankaracharya Swaroopanand Saraswati has announced that the construction of the Ram temple will begin on February 21
 param dharm sansad main ram mandir ke liye aadharshila rakhane kaa prastaav paarit kiya gaya he
 For this, monk saints will travel to Ayodhya
 shankaracharya swaroopanand saraswati ne ye ghoshnaa kii or bataaya ki iske liye sabhi akhaadon ke santon se bhi baat ho chuki he
 However, nothing has been said as to where the temple will be built
 param dharm sansad ne yah elaan aise samay kiya he jab maamla supreme court main lambit he or vishwa hindu parishad sahit anya sanghathan mandir nirmaan ke liye sarkaar par dabaav bana rahe hai
 The vhp's Dharma Sansad is to be held from today
 pradhanmantri narendra modi pehle hi kah chuke hai ki supreme court kaa faisla aane ke baad hi sarkaar koi nirnay legi
 But Hinduist organizations are pressurizing the government to build temples through religious parliaments and demonstrations
 baharhaal prayagraj main shankaracharya swaroopanand saraswati kii dharm sansad chal rahi he to duusari ore VHP kii dharm sansad 31 janvari or 1 farvari ko hogi
 This Dharma Sansad will include RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat along with religious gurus like Nritya Gopal Das
 kabhi aadharshila rakhenge, kabhi nirmaan karengesis tareeke se jagatguru shankaracharya swaroopanand saraswati ne prayagraj main mandir nirmaan agle maheene se shuru kiye jane kii ghoshnaa kii he, usee tarah kaa elaan sadhu-sant pehle bhi karte rahe hai
 Sometimes someone says that Ram will lay the foundation stone of the temple in Ayodhya, sometimes someone says that we will build the temple
 yah bhi ullekhneey he ki bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ne 1989 main palampur adhiveshan main prastaav paas kar ram mandir kaa khulkar samarthan kiya tha
 Since then she has been openly supportive of the temple issue
 jab vah satta main nahin thi to tatkaaleen sarkaron se kahati thi ki kanoon banaakar vivaadit bhoomi mandir banane ke liye de di jaae
 Another thing is that according to the tradition of Sanatan Hindu religion, Ramanandacharya sect has given the responsibility of maintenance and worship of this place to Nirmohi Akhara
 nirmohi akhaada 1885 se ram mandir kii kanoonee ladaai lard rahaa he
 Meaning that Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas of Vishwa Hindu Parishad does not represent all Hindus
 shankaracharya bhi VHP ke saath nahin hai
 It is said that the VHP trust wants the Nirmohi Arena out of it
 philhal kya kehete hai partiyon ke netaais bich ram mandir maamle main modi sarkaar ne supreme court se sarkaar dwaara adhigrahit gaiyr-vivaadit 67 acre jameen se yathasthiti hataate hue uske maalikon ko lautaane kii ijaajat maangi he
 Which has been welcomed by Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and Vishwa Hindu Parishad
 lekin raajnneetik dal isaki aalochana kar rahe hai
 Bahujan Samaj Party supremo Mayawati said, "demanding the disputed and authorized land to be returned to the Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas is an intervention in sheer justice and it is an election-influenced move
 centre sarkaar kaa yah kadam chunaav ko dekhte hue liya gaya he jisase aam logon ko satark rahanaa chahie
 This game of disturbing the status quo on the land of Ayodhya owned by the Supreme Court is provoking
 bijepi chunaav ko dhyaan main rakhkar ise anjaam de rahi he
 'on this issue, Congress and Communist parties say that the government should wait for the decision of the Supreme Court
 ve supreme court ke jariye mandir mudde kaa hal nikaale jane ke liye kahati rahi hai
 Congress leader and in-charge of Uttar Pradesh Raj Babbar had said a few days ago that there is no dispute over the construction of Ram temple
 asal main, jo vivaad he vah sambandhit bhoomi par malikana haq ko lekar he
 Ram Mandir Trust, Hanuman Akhara and Waqf Board are fighting cases in court on the land of Ram temple in Ayodhya
 adaalat ke baahar ram mandir nirmaan ko lekar bijepi sirf shigupha chhod rahi he
 At the same time, Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad says that people want that the petition related to the title of the land (title suit) should be disposed of at the earliest
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki centre sarkaar kaa supreme court main puraa bharosa he
 On 29 January, Union Minister Prakash Javadekar had said that BJP wants Ram temple to be built
 piem modi ne bhi is bare main intervyuu main kaha he
 The government's decision is also a legal route
 hamen puraa vishwaas he ki yah jameen mukt ho jaaegi
 This will pave the way
 dilli kii saat loksabhaa siton par aaj ho rahe matdaan main congress mahasachiv priyanka gandhi wadra ne bhi hissaa liya
 Priyanka Gandhi along with her husband Robert Vadra voted at the Lodi Estate in New Delhi
 is dauraan unhone pradhanmantri narendra modi kii 45 saal kii tapasya vaale bayaan par bhi jawaab diya
 Priyanka Gandhi said that if she had done penance even for 50 hours, she would not have hated such things
 Lok Sabha elections main voting ke baad jab matdaan centre se priyanka gandhi baahar ain to unhone media ke sawaalon kaa jawaab diya
 During this time, when asked that PM Modi has said that Khan Market Gang has not created my image, it is made up of 45 years of austerity which no one can destroy
 yahi sawaal jab priyanka gandhi se poocha gaya to unhone jawaab dete hue kaha ki agar 50 ghante kii tapasya kar lee hoti to is tarah se nafrat bhari baaten wo nahin karte
 'PM does not answer' Apart from this, Priyanka Gandhi also responded to the challenge given to PM Modi
 unhone kaha ki pradhanmantri ji kisi bhi baat kaa jawaab nahin dete
 Priyanka said that even the promises of 15 lakh rupees and 2 crore jobs, she did not respond to
 priyanka ne kaha ki wo (narendra modi) rahul ji kii chunauti kaa bhi jawaab nahin dete hai
 Priyanka also accused PM Narendra Modi of hatred and anger
 iske alaava priyanka gandhi ne yah bhi kaha ki bhaajapa sarkaar ja rahi he, ye baat bilkul spasht he
 At the same time, on the elections going on in the seats of Delhi, Priyanka said that the BJP will not benefit from not having an alliance with the Aam Aadmi Party

 Attacking Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, Rahul said that the NDA government is claiming in front of the world that Bihar has changed, but the claim of the state to shine is like throwing dust in the eyes of the people
 rahul ne daawa kiya ki maharashtra, haryana, dilli or punjab jaise anya rajyon main bihari chamak rahe hai, lekin apane pradesh main nahin
 If Bihar were really shining, people would not migrate from the state to other states in search of better opportunities

 Without naming Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi, he said, 'nitish refrains from campaigning for that leader during elections but after the elections both become friends
 ’ rahul ne sawaal uthaaya ki jab gujarat main dange ho rahe the to nitish kumaar chuppi kyon saadhe hue the? unhone kaha ki nitish ne centre main rajg kii tatkaaleen sarkaar main mantri pad se istipha nahin diya

 Uttar Pradesh and Bihar have to show direction to the country

 Some colleges have computer labs but labs are not open at all

 abhi jahaan bhi niyuktiyaan ho rahi hai wo bahut dhimi gati se ho rahi hai
 Not all posts are being filled
 har jagah ek shikshak par chaatro kii sankhya itani he ki koi bhi vishwa stareey chhodie zila stareey top college banane kaa sapana nahin dekh saktaa
 According to the guide lines drawn by the UGC, a teacher in a university that dreams of becoming world class should have only 20 students

 Mumbai runs from Kolhan in Jharkhand
 vahaan to sab kuch thik hi hona chahie
 This University of Mumbai is 130 years old

 It is counted among the large universities in India
 ye jawahar laal nehru librari he
 The building is fine but the condition inside is bad
 deevaaron par daraaren padi hui hai
 The roof drips during the rainy season
 duusari manzil kaa ek slab tut chukaa he
 Leave repair, no one has even picked up the debris
 yahaan par khel-kud ke saamaan to hai magar khilne ke liye jagah nahin he
 You yourself see its condition
 yahaan par ek haal bhi he jisaki chat do saal pehle tut gai thi, aaj tak marammat nahin hui he
 Students are prohibited from coming here due to security reasons
 do saal ho gaye, librari kii marammat nahin hui wo bhi mumbai uniwarsity main
 The condition of the library is telling that the leaders, vice chancellors have challenged you that they will ruin higher education and you will not be able to spoil them
 hamaare sahyogi sohit mishra ne yah jaankaree di he
 You see the condition of Mumbai University, we will not cry on the condition of Kolhan University, but after seeing the condition of the entire university, it will happen that you will stop crying about higher education
 aapke hukmaranon, netaaon ne aapako fansaa diya he
 Now you can't get out of it
 isse nikalne kaa ek hi rasta he ki aap apana dhyaan hindu-muslim jaise masalon main lagaaein
 Sohit Mishra is now taking you to the Bhavan Bhawan built on the University campus
 jane kaa rasta bhi nahin he
 Sohit brings you here, avoiding any kind of slipping
 kisi ko ghaas bhi nazar nahin aati he
 Mumbai University seems to have declared himself dead
 ye bhashaa bhawan he
 The campus of Bhasha Bhawan has been built in 2015, the building is lying in this way
 jo staff sohit ko lekar gaya wo saanp ke dar se aage nahin gaya
 Sohit has gone ahead and brought this picture for you
 ye mumbai uniwarsity ke campus main he
 Branda Kurla Complex is in Mumbai University
 ye shankar raav chouhan shikshak prashikshan kii building he
 The building was completed in 2012, inaugurated in 2015 but has not received NOC
 do saal se is imaarat kaa koi istemaal nahin hua he
 The university pictures we have shown are all positive stories
 sochie isse zyada positive kya ho saktaa he ki ham karodon rupee kii imaarat banaakar istemaal nahin karte hai, librari kii marammat nahin karte hai, class main professor nahin rakhte, phir bhi karodon chaatr inhen uniwarsity se har saal paas hote hai
 It cannot be a big positive story
 mumbai uniwarsity main ek vivaad bhi chal rahaa he
 Results of all subjects should have come here by 15 June
 jab rigelt nahin aayaa to hangaamaa hone laga
 The Governor ordered that the result should be declared by 31 August
 is bich mukhyamantri or shiksha mantri ne bhi aadesh die magar kuch nahin hua
 The result that should have come in June came on 19 September
 maharashtra main niyam he ki pariksha hone ke 30 se 45 din ke bheetar riselt aa janaa chahie
 Even after this, the results of 2300 students are yet to come
 jabaki doosraa satr shuru ho chukaa he
 It is said that 3700 answer sheets have disappeared
 is saal uniwarsity ne faisla liya ki sabhi nattejey online check honge
 Teachers did not have training and teachers were not enough
 jo nattejey ghoshit hue hai unamem kai chaatro ko 0 se lekar 5 ank die gaye hai
 He says that his paper did well
 chaatr dobaaraa jaanch kii maang kar rahe hai
 The comments dilli uniwarsity kii tarah mumbai uniwarsity bhi edock shikshakon ke bharose chal rahi he
 Seeing the way the posts are vacant here, it seems that there are two stages of the policies of the governments
 pehle to college main bagaiyr master ke padhaao taaki ve aaajeevan berojgaar bane rahe, agar inamen se koi phir bhi pard-likh letaa he to inhen kisi bhi haal main master mat banane do
 There should be 86 professors at Mumbai University but only 35
 professor ke 51 pad khaali hai
 There should be 279 Assistant Professors but there are only 170
 aap soch rahe honge ki koi to uniwarsity hogi jo dhang kii hogi, jahaan sabhi shikshak honge, hamen to nahin mili, aap hi bataa dijie ki aisi koun si uniwarsity he
 Education for children of ordinary income families is getting expensive and difficult
 isliye yah maamla kisi netaa ke routine bayaan se zyaada gambhir to he hi
 This Diwali is going to be very beautiful in Faizabad
 vahaan 2 lakh diye jalenge or ek kirtiman banane ja rahaa he
 200 crore rupees statue of Lord Rama is going to be built
 yah sari baaten sunakar kisi ko bhi bharosa ho jaae ki dharam-karam kaa kaam thik chal rahaa he
 It is expected that people will also include reading and reading in the work of dharam-karam
 shiksha bhi dharam kaa hi kaam he
 No major claims for this have been heard yet
 yah ayodhya kaa sabase bada college he kamta prasad sundar laal saket snatakottar mahavidhyalay he
 It is the college named after Kamta Prasad and Sundar Lal
 donon hi vyavsaayee hai
 Both of them became college in the city, so they had given 1-1 lakh rupees
 bahut mehnat se jaankaree jutai he
 There are around 11000 students here
 ladakiyon kii sahi sankhya kaa pataa to nahin chalaa lekin yah maaloom hua ki unke liye college ke campus main shauchalay nahin he
 There are only six toilets in the girls' workroom
 jo kaaphi nahin hai
 It was also heard that post graduate students have reduced college attendance
 saket college main 145 regular shikshak hone chahie magar yahaan 85 hi hai
 They too have been appointed recently
 bahut dinon tak yah college 60-65 shikshakon ke bharose chalata rahaa he
 Even today there is a shortage of 60 teachers
 kuch vishyon main guest teacher rakhe gaye hai jo 15 se 20 hazaar kii selary par padhaa rahe hai
 Tables are being made here at the moment which will be used during the Deepotsav
 deepawali ke liye mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ne ayodhya ke liye kai record tod kaaryakramon kii ghoshnaa kii he
 There is a college in Darshannagar of Faizabad, Gautam Buddha College, there are only 7-8 teachers
 jab hamaare sahyogi pramod shrivastav yahaan gaye to get band tha or andar main gaay-bakrii charaai ja rahi thim
 Shrubs have grown at the main gate itself
 gandagi kaa vivaran is vakt uchit nahin hoga kyonki ayodhya deepotvas main dubaa hua he
 This is a government college
 college kii imaarat kaa koun sa hissaa dekhakar aap khud ko tasalli dilaanaa chahenge ki kuch nahin hoga, keval is mulk main netaa baaten hi karenge
 Seeing the arrangement of the toilet, it seems that this is called the system
 jahaan shouch kii jagah ho vahiin kursiyaan rakh do
 There is a shortage of teachers in all subjects of this college
 yahaan saat vishyon kii padhai hoti he
 There are 125 students and 6 teachers
 angrezi main 20 chaatr hai or ek bhi shikshak nahin he
 There are 631 colleges in Avadh University
 33 ke kareeb hi sarkari hai or baaki self finance vaale college hai
 Which we call private colleges
 kai privet college main teacher aath se das hazaar main padhaa rahe hai
 The good thing is that there is no celebration now for studies
 samaaj or chaatro ne bhi ucch shiksha ke mudde ko chhod diya he
 Now we go to Chaibasa in Jharkhand
 yahaan par ek vishvavidhyalay he jiskaa naam he kolhaan uniwarsity
 The foundation of this university was laid for the most backward tribal and non-tribal students of the area
 2009 main uniwarsity banane kii ghoshnaa hui thi, abhi tak building banane kaa kaam chal rahaa he
 Tata College Chaibasa gave the land
 is uniwarsity kii bhi haalat yakeen dilaati he ki aap bharat main kahin bhi chale jaaiye, ucch shiksha kaa haal badahaal milegaa
 90 percent of the students studying at Kolhan University with 16 affiliated and 27 affiliated colleges are really poor
 zyaadaatar adivasee hai
 When we were shooting, it was a college holiday, otherwise you would have seen another reality of India
 yah bhi pataa chalaa ki har vibhaag ke paas do hi kamare hai
 One room is for MA first year and one room for second year
 ek kamare kaa aakaar bees bai bees foot kaa hi he
 There are hardly 40-50 students
 baaki chaatr khadey hokar yaa neeche baithkar class karte hai
 Harbans said that 75 percent of tribal students come here cycling from 40-40 km away
 ye sabhi saranda ilaake se aate hai
 Where even today, the mobile tower does not work properly
 uniwarsity main online farm bharne kii vyavastha to aa gai he magar network na hone ke kaaran kai chaatr farm nahin bhar pate hai
 Due to which many students are stuck in the same class for 2-2 years
 kyonki online farm nahin bharne ke kaaran imtahaan hi nahin de sakate hai
 It was also heard that when the students go to the Vice Chancellor with a problem, they drink coffee
 samasya kaa samaadhaan nahin hota magar samasya sunne kii ek yojana he jiskaa naam he 'coffee vid visi'
 This program is being organized in all the colleges of this university
 akhabaaron main khabar chhapati he ki aaj falaan college main 'coffee vid visi' he
 The Vice Chancellor will hear the students' problem
 samaadhaan nahin hota magar hedline ban jaati he
 You must be wondering where we reached Kolhan
 aap darshakon main se hi koi hamen yahaan se vahaan le ja rahaa he
 On August 13, 2009, the state government approved the position of 22 professors, 44 associate professors, 88 assistant professors for 22 departments of this university
 aaj tak yahaan kisi bhi sthaayee bahaali nahin hui he
 There are 22 teachers who have been brought here through transfers
 paryaavaran ko lekar ham kitne gambhir ho jate hai magar sthaneey media kii report se pataa chalaa ki yahaan paryaavaran vigyaan padhaane ke liye master hi nahin he
 There are 350 students in the Hindi department but only 2 are there to teach
 raajnneeti vibhaag main 300 chaatr hai magar padhaane vaale sirf ek hai
 University is formed for tribal society, there is no teacher for tribal studies
 ye chutkula sirf sarkarein hi suna sakati hai apni janata ko
 The public also continues to laugh and the leaders go away with their idols
 kuch college main computer lab he magar lab khulte hi nahin he
 The leaders come and inaugurate the lab and leave
 akhbaar main hedline chap jaati he ki digital india ho gaya he
 This news has appeared because the degree of phd in Kolhan University was first distributed and examination was taken later
 akhbaar main chapa he ki kolhaan uniwarsity ke pariksha niyantrak ne 8 sitambar, 2017 ko ek ajeebogarib adhisuchana jari kii
 In this, orders were also issued to researchers who have obtained phd degree to apply for the coursework examination
 aisa kam hi suna hoga ki pehle degree bant gai or phir imtahaan ho rahaa he
 It is important that we and you remain entangled with the issue of Taj Mahal so that the arrangements continue to fool us
 jamshedpur mahila college kaa haal bhi aap sun lijie
 This college, formed in 1953, has 9000 students
 1977 ke baad se yaha padon kii sankhya nahin badi he jabaki chaatraon kii sankhya kai guna bad gai he
 There should be 57 teachers but there are only 34 teachers
 46 guest teacher padhaa rahe hai jinhen maheene main 5000 se adhik nahin mil saktaa he
 Those taking post graduate classes are getting a salary of five thousand
 jo piji toppers hota he usee ko padhaane ke liye kaha jaataa he
 Details of teachers in some other colleges of this university have come to know that 84 posts are approved in Tata College Chaibasa but there are only 25 teachers
 mahila college chibasa main 40 pad manzur hai magar 15 shikshak hi hai
 Ghatshila College, Ghatshila has 40 posts, but only 18 teachers
 2008 ke baad se in collejon main niyukti hi nahin hui he
 Wherever appointments are being done, they are happening very slowly
 saare pad nahin bhare ja rahe hai
 The number of students on one teacher is so much that no one can dream of becoming a world-class district-level top college
 ujisi ne jo guide lines nikaali hai uske anusaar vishwa stareey banane kaa sapana dekhne vaali uniwarsity main ek shikshak par 20 hi chaatr hone chahie
 Neither is a teacher here at 300 students
 jharkhand ke kolhaan se chalate hai mumbai
 Everything must be right there
 130 saal puraani he yah mumbai uniwarsity
 It has 4 campuses and 774 colleges affiliated to it
 isaki ginati bharat ke bade vishvavidhyalayon main hoti he
 This is Jawaharlal Nehru Library
 imaarat to thik he magar andar haalat karaab hai
 There are cracks on the walls
 barsaat ke samay chat tapakati he
 a slab of the second floor has been broken
 marammat to chhodie kisi ne malba uthaaya tak nahin he
 There are sports items here but there is no place to play
 aap khud isaki haalat dekhte chaliye
 There is also a hall here whose roof was broken two years ago, it has not been repaired till date
 suraksha kaarnon se chaatro ko yahaan par aane se manaa kar diya gaya he
 It has been two years since the library was not repaired at Mumbai University
 librari kaa haal bataa rahaa he ki netaaon ne, vaais chancelaron ne aapako chunauti di he ki ve ucch shiksha ko barbaad kar denge or aap unka kuch nahin bigaad sakenge
 Our colleague Sohit Mishra has given this information
 aap mumbai uniwarsity kaa haal dekhie, kolhaan uniwarsity ke haal par nahin roenge balki sari universti kaa haal dekhne ke baad itnaa to hoga ki aap ucch shiksha ko lekar ronaa band kar denge
 Your rulers, leaders have implicated you
 ab aap isse nahin nikal sakate hai
 The only way to get out of this is to focus your attention on issues like hindu-muslim
 sohit mishra ab aapako universti campus main bane bhashaa bhawan lekar ja rahe hai
 There is not even a way to go
 kisi tarah phisalane se bachate hue sohit aapako yahaan le aate hai
 Nobody even sees grass
 aisa lagata he ki mumbai uniwarsity ne khud ko mrit ghoshit kar diya he
 This is the language building
 2015 main bhashaa bhawan kaa campus ban chukaa he, imaarat isi tarah padi hui he
 The staff who took Sohit did not go beyond the fear of snakes
 sohit aage gaye or aapke liye ye tasviir lekar aae hai
 It is on the campus of Mumbai University
 branda kurlaa complex main mumbai universti he
 This is the building of Shankar Rao Chauhan teacher training
 2012 main yah imaarat ban chuki he, 2015 main iskaa udghaatan bhi hua lekin ise enosi nahin mili he
 There has been no use of this building for two years
 hamane jo uniwarsity kii tasviir dikhaai hai wo sari kii sari positive story hai
 Think what can be more positive that we do not build and use crores of rupees, do not repair the library, do not keep professors in class, yet crores of students pass from these universities every year
 isse badi positive story ho hi nahin sakati
 a dispute is also going on at Mumbai University
 yahaan 15 june tak sabhi vishyon ke riselt aa jane chahie the
 When the result did not come, there was an uproar
 rajyapal ne aadesh diya ki 31 agast tak riselt ghoshit ho janaa chahie
 Meanwhile, the Chief Minister and the Education Minister also gave orders, but nothing happened
 june main jo rigelt aa janaa chahie tha wo aayaa 19 sitambar ko
 In Maharashtra, the rule is that the result should come within 30 to 45 days of the examination
 iske baad bhi 2300 chaatro ke nattejey abhi tak nahin aae hai
 While the second season has started
 kaha ja rahaa he ki 3700 uttar pustikaayen gaayab ho gai hai
 This year, the university decided that all the results would be checked online
 shikshakon ke paas training nahin thi or shikshak bhi paryaapt nahin the
 Many students have been given 0 to 5 marks in the results announced
 unka kahana he ki unka paper acha hua tha
 Students are demanding a double check
 tippaniyan Like Delhi University, Mumbai University is also relying on ad hoc teachers
 yahaan jis tarah pad khaali hai unhen dekhakar lagata he ki sarkaron kii nitiyon ke do charan he
 First, teach without a master in college so that they remain unemployed for a lifetime, if any of them still read and write, then do not let them become master in any case
 mumbai uniwarsity main 86 professor hone chahie magar hai sirf 35
 Professor has 51 vacancies
 sahaayak professor hone chahien 279 magar hai sirf 170
 You must be thinking that there will be some university which will be of the kind, where all the teachers will be there, we have not found them, you can tell which is such a university

 is uniwarsity kii bhi haalat yakeen dilaati he ki aap bharat main kahin bhi chale jaaiye, ucch shiksha kaa haal badahaal milegaa
 90 percent of the students studying at Kolhan University with 16 affiliated and 27 affiliated colleges are really poor
 zyaadaatar adivasee hai
 When we were shooting, it was a college holiday, otherwise you would have seen another reality of India
 yah bhi pataa chalaa ki har vibhaag ke paas do hi kamare hai
 One room is for MA first year and one room for second year
 ek kamare kaa aakaar bees bai bees foot kaa hi he
 There are hardly 40-50 students
 baaki chaatr khadey hokar yaa neeche baithkar class karte hai
 Harbans said that 75 percent of tribal students come here cycling from 40-40 km away
 ye sabhi saranda ilaake se aate hai
 Where even today, the mobile tower does not work properly
 uniwarsity main online farm bharne kii vyavastha to aa gai he magar network na hone ke kaaran kai chaatr farm nahin bhar pate hai
 Due to which many students are stuck in the same class for 2-2 years
 kyonki online farm nahin bharne ke kaaran imtahaan hi nahin de sakate hai
 It was also heard that when the students go to the Vice Chancellor with a problem, they drink coffee
 samasya kaa samaadhaan nahin hota magar samasya sunne kii ek yojana he jiskaa naam he 'coffee vid visi'
 This program is being organized in all the colleges of this university
 akhabaaron main khabar chhapati he ki aaj falaan college main 'coffee vid visi' he
 The Vice Chancellor will hear the students' problem
 samaadhaan nahin hota magar hedline ban jaati he
 You must be wondering where we reached Kolhan
 aap darshakon main se hi koi hamen yahaan se vahaan le ja rahaa he
 On August 13, 2009, the state government approved the position of 22 professors, 44 associate professors, 88 assistant professors for 22 departments of this university
 aaj tak yahaan kisi bhi sthaayee bahaali nahin hui he
 There are 22 teachers who have been brought here through transfers
 paryaavaran ko lekar ham kitne gambhir ho jate hai magar sthaneey media kii report se pataa chalaa ki yahaan paryaavaran vigyaan padhaane ke liye master hi nahin he
 There are 350 students in the Hindi department but only 2 are there to teach
 raajnneeti vibhaag main 300 chaatr hai magar padhaane vaale sirf ek hai
 University is formed for tribal society, there is no teacher for tribal studies
 ye chutkula sirf sarkarein hi suna sakati hai apni janata ko
 The public also continues to laugh and the leaders go away with their idols
 kuch college main computer lab he magar lab khulte hi nahin he
 The leaders come and inaugurate the lab and leave
 akhbaar main hedline chap jaati he ki digital india ho gaya he
 This news has appeared because the degree of phd in Kolhan University was first distributed and examination was taken later
 akhbaar main chapa he ki kolhaan uniwarsity ke pariksha niyantrak ne 8 sitambar, 2017 ko ek ajeebogarib adhisuchana jari kii
 In this, orders were also issued to researchers who have obtained phd degree to apply for the coursework examination
 aisa kam hi suna hoga ki pehle degree bant gai or phir imtahaan ho rahaa he
 It is important that we and you remain entangled with the issue of Taj Mahal so that the arrangements continue to fool us
 jamshedpur mahila college kaa haal bhi aap sun lijie
 This college, formed in 1953, has 9000 students
 1977 ke baad se yaha padon kii sankhya nahin badi he jabaki chaatraon kii sankhya kai guna bad gai he
 There should be 57 teachers but there are only 34 teachers
 46 guest teacher padhaa rahe hai jinhen maheene main 5000 se adhik nahin mil saktaa he
 Those taking post graduate classes are getting a salary of five thousand
 jo piji toppers hota he usee ko padhaane ke liye kaha jaataa he
 Details of teachers in some other colleges of this university have come to know that 84 posts are approved in Tata College Chaibasa but there are only 25 teachers
 mahila college chibasa main 40 pad manzur hai magar 15 shikshak hi hai
 Ghatshila College, Ghatshila has 40 posts, but only 18 teachers
 2008 ke baad se in collejon main niyukti hi nahin hui he
 Wherever appointments are being done, they are happening very slowly
 saare pad nahin bhare ja rahe hai
 The number of students on one teacher is so much that no one can dream of becoming a world-class district-level top college
 ujisi ne jo guide lines nikaali hai uske anusaar vishwa stareey banane kaa sapana dekhne vaali uniwarsity main ek shikshak par 20 hi chaatr hone chahie
 Neither is a teacher here at 300 students
 jharkhand ke kolhaan se chalate hai mumbai
 Everything must be right there
 130 saal puraani he yah mumbai uniwarsity
 It has 4 campuses and 774 colleges affiliated to it
 isaki ginati bharat ke bade vishvavidhyalayon main hoti he
 This is Jawaharlal Nehru Library
 imaarat to thik he magar andar haalat karaab hai
 There are cracks on the walls
 barsaat ke samay chat tapakati he
 a slab of the second floor has been broken
 marammat to chhodie kisi ne malba uthaaya tak nahin he
 There are sports items here but there is no place to play
 aap khud isaki haalat dekhte chaliye
 There is also a hall here whose roof was broken two years ago, it has not been repaired till date
 suraksha kaarnon se chaatro ko yahaan par aane se manaa kar diya gaya he
 It has been two years since the library was not repaired at Mumbai University
 librari kaa haal bataa rahaa he ki netaaon ne, vaais chancelaron ne aapako chunauti di he ki ve ucch shiksha ko barbaad kar denge or aap unka kuch nahin bigaad sakenge
 Our colleague Sohit Mishra has given this information
 aap mumbai uniwarsity kaa haal dekhie, kolhaan uniwarsity ke haal par nahin roenge balki sari universti kaa haal dekhne ke baad itnaa to hoga ki aap ucch shiksha ko lekar ronaa band kar denge
 Your rulers, leaders have implicated you
 ab aap isse nahin nikal sakate hai
 The only way to get out of this is to focus your attention on issues like hindu-muslim
 sohit mishra ab aapako universti campus main bane bhashaa bhawan lekar ja rahe hai
 There is not even a way to go
 kisi tarah phisalane se bachate hue sohit aapako yahaan le aate hai
 Nobody even sees grass
 aisa lagata he ki mumbai uniwarsity ne khud ko mrit ghoshit kar diya he
 This is the language building
 2015 main bhashaa bhawan kaa campus ban chukaa he, imaarat isi tarah padi hui he
 The staff who took Sohit did not go beyond the fear of snakes
 sohit aage gaye or aapke liye ye tasviir lekar aae hai
 It is on the campus of Mumbai University
 branda kurlaa complex main mumbai universti he
 This is the building of Shankar Rao Chauhan teacher training
 2012 main yah imaarat ban chuki he, 2015 main iskaa udghaatan bhi hua lekin ise enosi nahin mili he
 There has been no use of this building for two years
 hamane jo uniwarsity kii tasviir dikhaai hai wo sari kii sari positive story hai
 Think what can be more positive that we do not build and use crores of rupees, do not repair the library, do not keep professors in class, yet crores of students pass from these universities every year
 isse badi positive story ho hi nahin sakati
 a dispute is also going on at Mumbai University
 yahaan 15 june tak sabhi vishyon ke riselt aa jane chahie the
 When the result did not come, there was an uproar
 rajyapal ne aadesh diya ki 31 agast tak riselt ghoshit ho janaa chahie
 Meanwhile, the Chief Minister and the Education Minister also gave orders, but nothing happened
 june main jo rigelt aa janaa chahie tha wo aayaa 19 sitambar ko
 In Maharashtra, the rule is that the result should come within 30 to 45 days of the examination
 iske baad bhi 2300 chaatro ke nattejey abhi tak nahin aae hai
 While the second season has started
 kaha ja rahaa he ki 3700 uttar pustikaayen gaayab ho gai hai
 This year, the university decided that all the results would be checked online
 shikshakon ke paas training nahin thi or shikshak bhi paryaapt nahin the
 Many students have been given 0 to 5 marks in the results announced
 unka kahana he ki unka paper acha hua tha
 Students are demanding a double check
 tippaniyan Like Delhi University, Mumbai University is also relying on ad hoc teachers
 yahaan jis tarah pad khaali hai unhen dekhakar lagata he ki sarkaron kii nitiyon ke do charan he
 First, teach without a master in college so that they remain unemployed for a lifetime, if any of them still read and write, then do not let them become master in any case
 mumbai uniwarsity main 86 professor hone chahie magar hai sirf 35
 Professor has 51 vacancies
 sahaayak professor hone chahien 279 magar hai sirf 170
 You must be thinking that there will be some university which will be of the kind, where all the teachers will be there, we have not found them, you can tell which is such a university
 ladakiyon kii sahi sankhya kaa pataa to nahin chalaa lekin yah maaloom hua ki unke liye college ke campus main shauchalay nahin he
 There are only six toilets in the girls' workroom
 jo kaaphi nahin hai
 It was also heard that post graduate students have reduced college attendance
 saket college main 145 regular shikshak hone chahie magar yahaan 85 hi hai
 They too have been appointed recently
 bahut dinon tak yah college 60-65 shikshakon ke bharose chalata rahaa he
 Even today there is a shortage of 60 teachers
 kuch vishyon main guest teacher rakhe gaye hai jo 15 se 20 hazaar kii selary par padhaa rahe hai
 Tables are being made here at the moment which will be used during the Deepotsav
 deepawali ke liye mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ne ayodhya ke liye kai record tod kaaryakramon kii ghoshnaa kii he
 There is a college in Darshannagar of Faizabad, Gautam Buddha College, there are only 7-8 teachers
 jab hamaare sahyogi pramod shrivastav yahaan gaye to get band tha or andar main gaay-bakrii charaai ja rahi thim
 Shrubs have grown at the main gate itself
 gandagi kaa vivaran is vakt uchit nahin hoga kyonki ayodhya deepotvas main dubaa hua he
 This is a government college
 college kii imaarat kaa koun sa hissaa dekhakar aap khud ko tasalli dilaanaa chahenge ki kuch nahin hoga, keval is mulk main netaa baaten hi karenge
 Seeing the arrangement of the toilet, it seems that this is called the system
 jahaan shouch kii jagah ho vahiin kursiyaan rakh do
 There is a shortage of teachers in all subjects of this college
 yahaan saat vishyon kii padhai hoti he
 There are 125 students and 6 teachers
 angrezi main 20 chaatr hai or ek bhi shikshak nahin he
 There are 631 colleges in Avadh University
 33 ke kareeb hi sarkari hai or baaki self finance vaale college hai
 Which we call private colleges
 kai privet college main teacher aath se das hazaar main padhaa rahe hai
 The good thing is that there is no celebration now for studies
 samaaj or chaatro ne bhi ucch shiksha ke mudde ko chhod diya he
 Now we go to Chaibasa in Jharkhand
 yahaan par ek vishvavidhyalay he jiskaa naam he kolhaan uniwarsity
 The foundation of this university was laid for the most backward tribal and non-tribal students of the area
 2009 main uniwarsity banane kii ghoshnaa hui thi, abhi tak building banane kaa kaam chal rahaa he
 Tata College Chaibasa gave the land
 is uniwarsity kii bhi haalat yakeen dilaati he ki aap bharat main kahin bhi chale jaaiye, ucch shiksha kaa haal badahaal milegaa

 faizabad ke hi darshananagar main ek college he gautam buddha mahavidhyalay, vahaan par 7-8 shikshak hi hai
 When our colleague Pramod Srivastava went here, the gate was closed and cow and goat were being grazed inside
 main get par hi jhaadiyaan ug ai hai
 The details of the mess will not be appropriate at this time because Ayodhya is immersed in the Deepotvas
 sarkari college he ye
 Seeing which part of the college building would you like to convince yourself that nothing will happen, only the leaders will talk in this country
 shauchalay kii vyavastha dekhakar lagata he ki vyavastha isi ko kehete hai
 Place chairs where there is a place of defecation
 is kalege ke sabhi vishyon main shikshakon kii kami he
 There are seven subjects taught here
 125 chaatr hai or 6 shikshak hai
 There are 20 students in English and not a single teacher
 avadh uniwarsity main 631 college jude hai
 Around 33 are government-run and the rest are self-finance colleges
 jinhen ham privet college kehete hai
 Teachers are teaching eight to ten thousand in many private colleges
 acchhee baat he ki padhai ko lekar ab kahin utsav nahin he
 Society and students have also left the issue of higher education
 ab ham chalate hai jharkhand ke chibasa
 There is a university here called Kolhan University
 is uniwarsity kii buniyaad ilaake ke ati pichde adivasee or gair adivasee chaatro ke liye rakhi gai thi
 The university was announced in 2009, yet the construction work is going on
 tata college chibasa ne hi jameen di thi
 The condition of this university also assures that you can go anywhere in India, you will get the condition of higher education
 16 angeebhoot or 27 sambhddha collejon vaali kolhaan uniwarsity main padhane vaale 90 fisadi chaatr vaaki garib hai
 Most are tribal
 ham jab shoot kar rahe the tab college kii chuttee ho chuki thi, varanaa aap bharat kii ek or hakeekat dekhte
 It was also learned that each department has only two rooms
 ek cameraa eme pratham varsh or ek cameraa duusare varsh ke liye he
 The size of a room is twenty by twenty feet
 mushkil se 40-50 chaatr aate hai
 The rest of the students do class by standing or sitting down
 harbans ne bataaya ki yahaan 75 fisadi adivasee chaatr 40-40 kimi dur se cycle chalaakar aate hai
 They all come from Saranda area
 jahaan aaj bhi mobile tower thik se kaam nahin karata he
 The system of filling the online form has come to the university, but due to lack of network, many students are unable to fill the form
 jiske kaaran kai chaatr ek hi class main 2-2 saal se atak gaye hai
 Because you cannot give exams due to not filling the online form
 yah bhi sunne ko mila ki samasya lekar chaatr jab vaais chancelar ke paas jate hai to ve coffee pilaate hai
 The problem is not solved, but there is a plan to listen to the problem called 'coffee with VC'
 yah kaarykram is uniwarsity ke tamaam collejon main yojit kiya ja rahaa he
 News appears in newspapers that today there is 'coffee with VC' in Falan College
 vaais chancelar chaatro kii samasya sunenge
 There is no solution but a headline is created
 aap soch rahe honge ki ham kolhaan kahaan pahunch gaye
 Someone in the audience is taking us from here to there
 13 agast, 2009 ko is uniwarsity ke 22 vibhaagon ke liye 22 professor, 44 associat professor, 88 sahaayak professor ke pad ke liye rajya sarkaar ne sweekruti di thi
 Till date there has not been any permanent restoration here
 22 teacher hai jinhen tabadale ke zarie yahaan laayaa gaya he
 How serious we get about the environment, but local media reports showed that there is no master to teach environmental science here
 hindi vibhaag main 350 chaatr hai magar padhaane vaale sirf 2 hai
 There are 300 students in the Department of Politics but there is only one to teach
 janajaatiy samaaj ke liye uniwarsity banati he, janajaatiy adhyayan ke liye bhi shikshak nahin he
 Only governments can tell these jokes to their people
 janata bhi hansatii rah jaati he or netaa apni murti banavaa kar chale jate hai
 Some colleges have computer labs but labs are not open at all
 netaa aate hai or lab kaa udghaatan karke chale jate hai
 The headline is printed in the newspaper that Digital India is done
 ye khabar isliye chhapi he ki kolhaan uniwarsity main pichdi kii degree pehle baant di gai or imtahaan baad main liya gaya
 It has been published in the newspaper that the Controller of Examinations of Kolhan University issued a strange notification on September 8, 2017
 isamen piechdi kii oopaadhi praapt kar chuke shodharthiyon ko bhi corsework kii pariksha ke liye aavedan karne ke aadesh jari kiye gaye the
 It is rarely heard that the degree is divided first and then the examination is being done
 zaruri he ki ham or aap taj mahal ke masale ko lekar uljhe rahe taaki vyavasthaaen hamen bevakoof banaati rahen
 You can also listen to the condition of Jamshedpur Women's College
 1953 main bane is kalege main 9000 chatraayen padhati hai
 The number of posts has not increased since 1977, while the number of girl students has increased manifold
 yahaan par 57 shikshak hone chahie magar hai 34 shikshak hi
 There are 46 guest teachers who cannot get more than 5000 a month
 post graduate kii class lene vaale ko paanch hazaar kii selary mil rahi he
 Those who are PG toppers are asked to teach the same
 is uniwarsity ke kuch or collejon main shikshakon kaa detail pataa chalaa he ki tata college chibasa main 84 pad manzur hai magar 25 shikshak hi hai
 There are 40 posts sanctioned in the women's college Chaibasa but only 15 teachers
 ghatshila college, ghatshila main 40 pad manzur hai magar 18 shikshak hi hai
 There has been no appointment in these colleges since 2008
 abhi jahaan bhi niyuktiyaan ho rahi hai wo bahut dhimi gati se ho rahi hai
 Not all posts are being filled
 har jagah ek shikshak par chaatro kii sankhya itani he ki koi bhi vishwa stareey chhodie zila stareey top college banane kaa sapana nahin dekh saktaa
 According to the guide lines drawn by the UGC, a teacher in a university that dreams of becoming world class should have only 20 students
 yahaan na to 300 chaatro par ek teacher he
 Mumbai runs from Kolhan in Jharkhand
 vahaan to sab kuch thik hi hona chahie
 This University of Mumbai is 130 years old
 iske 4 campus hai or 774 college sambanddh hai
 It is counted among the large universities in India
 ye jawahar laal nehru librari he
 The building is fine but the condition inside is bad
 deevaaron par daraaren padi hui hai
 The roof drips during the rainy season
 duusari manzil kaa ek slab tut chukaa he
 Leave repair, no one has even picked up the debris
 yahaan par khel-kud ke saamaan to hai magar khilne ke liye jagah nahin he
 You yourself see its condition
 yahaan par ek haal bhi he jisaki chat do saal pehle tut gai thi, aaj tak marammat nahin hui he
 Students are prohibited from coming here due to security reasons
 do saal ho gaye, librari kii marammat nahin hui wo bhi mumbai uniwarsity main
 The condition of the library is telling that the leaders, vice chancellors have challenged you that they will ruin higher education and you will not be able to spoil them
 hamaare sahyogi sohit mishra ne yah jaankaree di he
 You see the condition of Mumbai University, we will not cry on the condition of Kolhan University, but after seeing the condition of the entire university, it will happen that you will stop crying about higher education
 aapke hukmaranon, netaaon ne aapako fansaa diya he
 Now you can't get out of it
 isse nikalne kaa ek hi rasta he ki aap apana dhyaan hindu-muslim jaise masalon main lagaaein
 Sohit Mishra is now taking you to the Bhavan Bhawan built on the University campus
 jane kaa rasta bhi nahin he
 Sohit brings you here, avoiding any kind of slipping
 kisi ko ghaas bhi nazar nahin aati he
 Mumbai University seems to have declared himself dead
 ye bhashaa bhawan he
 The campus of Bhasha Bhawan has been built in 2015, the building is lying in this way
 jo staff sohit ko lekar gaya wo saanp ke dar se aage nahin gaya
 Sohit has gone ahead and brought this picture for you
 ye mumbai uniwarsity ke campus main he
 Branda Kurla Complex is in Mumbai University
 ye shankar raav chouhan shikshak prashikshan kii building he
 The building was completed in 2012, inaugurated in 2015 but has not received NOC
 do saal se is imaarat kaa koi istemaal nahin hua he
 The university pictures we have shown are all positive stories
 sochie isse zyada positive kya ho saktaa he ki ham karodon rupee kii imaarat banaakar istemaal nahin karte hai, librari kii marammat nahin karte hai, class main professor nahin rakhte, phir bhi karodon chaatr inhen uniwarsity se har saal paas hote hai
 It cannot be a big positive story
 mumbai uniwarsity main ek vivaad bhi chal rahaa he
 Results of all subjects should have come here by 15 June
 jab rigelt nahin aayaa to hangaamaa hone laga
 The Governor ordered that the result should be declared by 31 August
 is bich mukhyamantri or shiksha mantri ne bhi aadesh die magar kuch nahin hua
 The result that should have come in June came on 19 September
 maharashtra main niyam he ki pariksha hone ke 30 se 45 din ke bheetar riselt aa janaa chahie
 Even after this, the results of 2300 students are yet to come
 jabaki doosraa satr shuru ho chukaa he
 It is said that 3700 answer sheets have disappeared
 is saal uniwarsity ne faisla liya ki sabhi nattejey online check honge
 Teachers did not have training and teachers were not enough
 jo nattejey ghoshit hue hai unamem kai chaatro ko 0 se lekar 5 ank die gaye hai
 He says that his paper did well
 chaatr dobaaraa jaanch kii maang kar rahe hai
 The comments dilli uniwarsity kii tarah mumbai uniwarsity bhi edock shikshakon ke bharose chal rahi he
 Seeing the way the posts are vacant here, it seems that there are two stages of the policies of the governments
 pehle to college main bagaiyr master ke padhaao taaki ve aaajeevan berojgaar bane rahe, agar inamen se koi phir bhi pard-likh letaa he to inhen kisi bhi haal main master mat banane do
 There should be 86 professors at Mumbai University but only 35
 professor ke 51 pad khaali hai
 There should be 279 Assistant Professors but there are only 170
 aap soch rahe honge ki koi to uniwarsity hogi jo dhang kii hogi, jahaan sabhi shikshak honge, hamen to nahin mili, aap hi bataa dijie ki aisi koun si uniwarsity he
 Seeing the arrangement of the toilet, it seems that this is called the system
 jahaan shouch kii jagah ho vahiin kursiyaan rakh do
 There is a shortage of teachers in all subjects of this college
 yahaan saat vishyon kii padhai hoti he
 There are 125 students and 6 teachers
 angrezi main 20 chaatr hai or ek bhi shikshak nahin he
 There are 631 colleges in Avadh University
 33 ke kareeb hi sarkari hai or baaki self finance vaale college hai
 Which we call private colleges
 kai privet college main teacher aath se das hazaar main padhaa rahe hai
 The good thing is that there is no celebration now for studies
 samaaj or chaatro ne bhi ucch shiksha ke mudde ko chhod diya he
 Now we go to Chaibasa in Jharkhand
 yahaan par ek vishvavidhyalay he jiskaa naam he kolhaan uniwarsity
 The foundation of this university was laid for the most backward tribal and non-tribal students of the area
 2009 main uniwarsity banane kii ghoshnaa hui thi, abhi tak building banane kaa kaam chal rahaa he
 Tata College Chaibasa gave the land
 is uniwarsity kii bhi haalat yakeen dilaati he ki aap bharat main kahin bhi chale jaaiye, ucch shiksha kaa haal badahaal milegaa
 90 percent of the students studying at Kolhan University with 16 affiliated and 27 affiliated colleges are really poor
 zyaadaatar adivasee hai
 When we were shooting, it was a college holiday, otherwise you would have seen another reality of India
 yah bhi pataa chalaa ki har vibhaag ke paas do hi kamare hai
 One room is for MA first year and one room for second year
 ek kamare kaa aakaar bees bai bees foot kaa hi he
 There are hardly 40-50 students
 baaki chaatr khadey hokar yaa neeche baithkar class karte hai
 Harbans said that 75 percent of tribal students come here cycling from 40-40 km away
 ye sabhi saranda ilaake se aate hai
 Where even today, the mobile tower does not work properly
 uniwarsity main online farm bharne kii vyavastha to aa gai he magar network na hone ke kaaran kai chaatr farm nahin bhar pate hai
 Due to which many students are stuck in the same class for 2-2 years
 kyonki online farm nahin bharne ke kaaran imtahaan hi nahin de sakate hai
 It was also heard that when the students go to the Vice Chancellor with a problem, they drink coffee
 samasya kaa samaadhaan nahin hota magar samasya sunne kii ek yojana he jiskaa naam he 'coffee vid visi'
 This program is being organized in all the colleges of this university
 akhabaaron main khabar chhapati he ki aaj falaan college main 'coffee vid visi' he
 The Vice Chancellor will hear the students' problem
 samaadhaan nahin hota magar hedline ban jaati he
 You must be wondering where we reached Kolhan
 aap darshakon main se hi koi hamen yahaan se vahaan le ja rahaa he
 On August 13, 2009, the state government approved the position of 22 professors, 44 associate professors, 88 assistant professors for 22 departments of this university
 aaj tak yahaan kisi bhi sthaayee bahaali nahin hui he
 There are 22 teachers who have been brought here through transfers
 paryaavaran ko lekar ham kitne gambhir ho jate hai magar sthaneey media kii report se pataa chalaa ki yahaan paryaavaran vigyaan padhaane ke liye master hi nahin he
 There are 350 students in the Hindi department but only 2 are there to teach
 raajnneeti vibhaag main 300 chaatr hai magar padhaane vaale sirf ek hai
 University is formed for tribal society, there is no teacher for tribal studies
 ye chutkula sirf sarkarein hi suna sakati hai apni janata ko
 The public also continues to laugh and the leaders go away with their idols
 kuch college main computer lab he magar lab khulte hi nahin he
 The leaders come and inaugurate the lab and leave
 akhbaar main hedline chap jaati he ki digital india ho gaya he
 This news has appeared because the degree of phd in Kolhan University was first distributed and examination was taken later
 akhbaar main chapa he ki kolhaan uniwarsity ke pariksha niyantrak ne 8 sitambar, 2017 ko ek ajeebogarib adhisuchana jari kii
 In this, orders were also issued to researchers who have obtained phd degree to apply for the coursework examination
 aisa kam hi suna hoga ki pehle degree bant gai or phir imtahaan ho rahaa he
 It is important that we and you remain entangled with the issue of Taj Mahal so that the arrangements continue to fool us
 jamshedpur mahila college kaa haal bhi aap sun lijie
 This college, formed in 1953, has 9000 students
 1977 ke baad se yaha padon kii sankhya nahin badi he jabaki chaatraon kii sankhya kai guna bad gai he
 There should be 57 teachers but there are only 34 teachers
 46 guest teacher padhaa rahe hai jinhen maheene main 5000 se adhik nahin mil saktaa he
 Those taking post graduate classes are getting a salary of five thousand
 jo piji toppers hota he usee ko padhaane ke liye kaha jaataa he
 Details of teachers in some other colleges of this university have come to know that 84 posts are approved in Tata College Chaibasa but there are only 25 teachers
 mahila college chibasa main 40 pad manzur hai magar 15 shikshak hi hai
 Ghatshila College, Ghatshila has 40 posts, but only 18 teachers
 2008 ke baad se in collejon main niyukti hi nahin hui he
 Wherever appointments are being done, they are happening very slowly
 saare pad nahin bhare ja rahe hai
 The number of students on one teacher is so much that no one can dream of becoming a world-class district-level top college
 ujisi ne jo guide lines nikaali hai uske anusaar vishwa stareey banane kaa sapana dekhne vaali uniwarsity main ek shikshak par 20 hi chaatr hone chahie
 Neither is a teacher here at 300 students
 jharkhand ke kolhaan se chalate hai mumbai
 Everything must be right there
 130 saal puraani he yah mumbai uniwarsity
 It has 4 campuses and 774 colleges affiliated to it
 isaki ginati bharat ke bade vishvavidhyalayon main hoti he
 This is Jawaharlal Nehru Library
 imaarat to thik he magar andar haalat karaab hai
 There are cracks on the walls
 barsaat ke samay chat tapakati he
 a slab of the second floor has been broken
 marammat to chhodie kisi ne malba uthaaya tak nahin he
 There are sports items here but there is no place to play
 aap khud isaki haalat dekhte chaliye
 There is also a hall here whose roof was broken two years ago, it has not been repaired till date
 suraksha kaarnon se chaatro ko yahaan par aane se manaa kar diya gaya he
 It has been two years since the library was not repaired at Mumbai University
 librari kaa haal bataa rahaa he ki netaaon ne, vaais chancelaron ne aapako chunauti di he ki ve ucch shiksha ko barbaad kar denge or aap unka kuch nahin bigaad sakenge
 Our colleague Sohit Mishra has given this information
 aap mumbai uniwarsity kaa haal dekhie, kolhaan uniwarsity ke haal par nahin roenge balki sari universti kaa haal dekhne ke baad itnaa to hoga ki aap ucch shiksha ko lekar ronaa band kar denge
 Your rulers, leaders have implicated you
 ab aap isse nahin nikal sakate hai
 The only way to get out of this is to focus your attention on issues like hindu-muslim
 sohit mishra ab aapako universti campus main bane bhashaa bhawan lekar ja rahe hai
 There is not even a way to go
 kisi tarah phisalane se bachate hue sohit aapako yahaan le aate hai
 Nobody even sees grass
 aisa lagata he ki mumbai uniwarsity ne khud ko mrit ghoshit kar diya he
 This is the language building
 2015 main bhashaa bhawan kaa campus ban chukaa he, imaarat isi tarah padi hui he
 The staff who took Sohit did not go beyond the fear of snakes
 sohit aage gaye or aapke liye ye tasviir lekar aae hai
 It is on the campus of Mumbai University
 branda kurlaa complex main mumbai universti he
 This is the building of Shankar Rao Chauhan teacher training
 2012 main yah imaarat ban chuki he, 2015 main iskaa udghaatan bhi hua lekin ise enosi nahin mili he
 There has been no use of this building for two years
 hamane jo uniwarsity kii tasviir dikhaai hai wo sari kii sari positive story hai
 Think what can be more positive that we do not build and use crores of rupees, do not repair the library, do not keep professors in class, yet crores of students pass from these universities every year
 isse badi positive story ho hi nahin sakati
 a dispute is also going on at Mumbai University
 yahaan 15 june tak sabhi vishyon ke riselt aa jane chahie the
 When the result did not come, there was an uproar
 rajyapal ne aadesh diya ki 31 agast tak riselt ghoshit ho janaa chahie
 Meanwhile, the Chief Minister and the Education Minister also gave orders, but nothing happened
 june main jo rigelt aa janaa chahie tha wo aayaa 19 sitambar ko
 In Maharashtra, the rule is that the result should come within 30 to 45 days of the examination
 iske baad bhi 2300 chaatro ke nattejey abhi tak nahin aae hai
 While the second season has started
 kaha ja rahaa he ki 3700 uttar pustikaayen gaayab ho gai hai
 This year, the university decided that all the results would be checked online
 shikshakon ke paas training nahin thi or shikshak bhi paryaapt nahin the
 Many students have been given 0 to 5 marks in the results announced
 unka kahana he ki unka paper acha hua tha
 Students are demanding a double check
 tippaniyan Like Delhi University, Mumbai University is also relying on ad hoc teachers
 yahaan jis tarah pad khaali hai unhen dekhakar lagata he ki sarkaron kii nitiyon ke do charan he
 First, teach without a master in college so that they remain unemployed for a lifetime, if any of them still read and write, then do not let them become master in any case
 mumbai uniwarsity main 86 professor hone chahie magar hai sirf 35
 Professor has 51 vacancies
 sahaayak professor hone chahien 279 magar hai sirf 170
 You must be thinking that there will be some university which will be of the kind, where all the teachers will be there, we have not found them, you can tell which is such a university
 acchhee baat he ki padhai ko lekar ab kahin utsav nahin he
 Society and students have also left the issue of higher education
 ab ham chalate hai jharkhand ke chibasa
 There is a university here called Kolhan University
 is uniwarsity kii buniyaad ilaake ke ati pichde adivasee or gair adivasee chaatro ke liye rakhi gai thi
 The university was announced in 2009, yet the construction work is going on
 tata college chibasa ne hi jameen di thi
 The condition of this university also assures that you can go anywhere in India, you will get the condition of higher education
 16 angeebhoot or 27 sambhddha collejon vaali kolhaan uniwarsity main padhane vaale 90 fisadi chaatr vaaki garib hai
 Most are tribal
 ham jab shoot kar rahe the tab college kii chuttee ho chuki thi, varanaa aap bharat kii ek or hakeekat dekhte
 It was also learned that each department has only two rooms
 ek cameraa eme pratham varsh or ek cameraa duusare varsh ke liye he
 The size of a room is twenty by twenty feet
 mushkil se 40-50 chaatr aate hai
 The rest of the students do class by standing or sitting down
 harbans ne bataaya ki yahaan 75 fisadi adivasee chaatr 40-40 kimi dur se cycle chalaakar aate hai
 They all come from Saranda area
 jahaan aaj bhi mobile tower thik se kaam nahin karata he
 The system of filling the online form has come to the university, but due to lack of network, many students are unable to fill the form
 jiske kaaran kai chaatr ek hi class main 2-2 saal se atak gaye hai
 Because you cannot give exams due to not filling the online form
 yah bhi sunne ko mila ki samasya lekar chaatr jab vaais chancelar ke paas jate hai to ve coffee pilaate hai
 The problem is not solved, but there is a plan to listen to the problem called 'coffee with VC'
 yah kaarykram is uniwarsity ke tamaam collejon main yojit kiya ja rahaa he
 News appears in newspapers that today there is 'coffee with VC' in Falan College
 vaais chancelar chaatro kii samasya sunenge
 There is no solution but a headline is created
 aap soch rahe honge ki ham kolhaan kahaan pahunch gaye
 Someone in the audience is taking us from here to there
 13 agast, 2009 ko is uniwarsity ke 22 vibhaagon ke liye 22 professor, 44 associat professor, 88 sahaayak professor ke pad ke liye rajya sarkaar ne sweekruti di thi
 Till date there has not been any permanent restoration here
 22 teacher hai jinhen tabadale ke zarie yahaan laayaa gaya he
 How serious we get about the environment, but local media reports showed that there is no master to teach environmental science here
 hindi vibhaag main 350 chaatr hai magar padhaane vaale sirf 2 hai
 There are 300 students in the Department of Politics but there is only one to teach
 janajaatiy samaaj ke liye uniwarsity banati he, janajaatiy adhyayan ke liye bhi shikshak nahin he
 Only governments can tell these jokes to their people
 janata bhi hansatii rah jaati he or netaa apni murti banavaa kar chale jate hai
 Some colleges have computer labs but labs are not open at all
 netaa aate hai or lab kaa udghaatan karke chale jate hai
 The headline is printed in the newspaper that Digital India is done
 ye khabar isliye chhapi he ki kolhaan uniwarsity main pichdi kii degree pehle baant di gai or imtahaan baad main liya gaya
 It has been published in the newspaper that the Controller of Examinations of Kolhan University issued a strange notification on September 8, 2017
 isamen piechdi kii oopaadhi praapt kar chuke shodharthiyon ko bhi corsework kii pariksha ke liye aavedan karne ke aadesh jari kiye gaye the
 It is rarely heard that the degree is divided first and then the examination is being done
 zaruri he ki ham or aap taj mahal ke masale ko lekar uljhe rahe taaki vyavasthaaen hamen bevakoof banaati rahen
 You can also listen to the condition of Jamshedpur Women's College
 1953 main bane is kalege main 9000 chatraayen padhati hai
 The number of posts has not increased since 1977, while the number of girl students has increased manifold
 yahaan par 57 shikshak hone chahie magar hai 34 shikshak hi
 There are 46 guest teachers who cannot get more than 5000 a month
 post graduate kii class lene vaale ko paanch hazaar kii selary mil rahi he
 Those who are PG toppers are asked to teach the same
 is uniwarsity ke kuch or collejon main shikshakon kaa detail pataa chalaa he ki tata college chibasa main 84 pad manzur hai magar 25 shikshak hi hai
 There are 40 posts sanctioned in the women's college Chaibasa but only 15 teachers
 ghatshila college, ghatshila main 40 pad manzur hai magar 18 shikshak hi hai
 There has been no appointment in these colleges since 2008
 abhi jahaan bhi niyuktiyaan ho rahi hai wo bahut dhimi gati se ho rahi hai
 Not all posts are being filled
 har jagah ek shikshak par chaatro kii sankhya itani he ki koi bhi vishwa stareey chhodie zila stareey top college banane kaa sapana nahin dekh saktaa
 According to the guide lines drawn by the UGC, a teacher in a university that dreams of becoming world class should have only 20 students
 yahaan na to 300 chaatro par ek teacher he
 Mumbai runs from Kolhan in Jharkhand
 vahaan to sab kuch thik hi hona chahie
 This University of Mumbai is 130 years old
 iske 4 campus hai or 774 college sambanddh hai
 It is counted among the large universities in India
 ye jawahar laal nehru librari he
 The building is fine but the condition inside is bad
 deevaaron par daraaren padi hui hai
 The roof drips during the rainy season
 duusari manzil kaa ek slab tut chukaa he
 Leave repair, no one has even picked up the debris
 yahaan par khel-kud ke saamaan to hai magar khilne ke liye jagah nahin he
 You yourself see its condition
 yahaan par ek haal bhi he jisaki chat do saal pehle tut gai thi, aaj tak marammat nahin hui he
 Students are prohibited from coming here due to security reasons
 do saal ho gaye, librari kii marammat nahin hui wo bhi mumbai uniwarsity main
 The condition of the library is telling that the leaders, vice chancellors have challenged you that they will ruin higher education and you will not be able to spoil them
 hamaare sahyogi sohit mishra ne yah jaankaree di he
 You see the condition of Mumbai University, we will not cry on the condition of Kolhan University, but after seeing the condition of the entire university, it will happen that you will stop crying about higher education
 aapke hukmaranon, netaaon ne aapako fansaa diya he
 Now you can't get out of it
 isse nikalne kaa ek hi rasta he ki aap apana dhyaan hindu-muslim jaise masalon main lagaaein
 Sohit Mishra is now taking you to the Bhavan Bhawan built on the University campus
 jane kaa rasta bhi nahin he
 Sohit brings you here, avoiding any kind of slipping
 kisi ko ghaas bhi nazar nahin aati he
 Mumbai University seems to have declared himself dead
 ye bhashaa bhawan he
 The campus of Bhasha Bhawan has been built in 2015, the building is lying in this way
 jo staff sohit ko lekar gaya wo saanp ke dar se aage nahin gaya
 Sohit has gone ahead and brought this picture for you
 ye mumbai uniwarsity ke campus main he
 Branda Kurla Complex is in Mumbai University
 ye shankar raav chouhan shikshak prashikshan kii building he
 The building was completed in 2012, inaugurated in 2015 but has not received NOC
 do saal se is imaarat kaa koi istemaal nahin hua he
 The university pictures we have shown are all positive stories
 sochie isse zyada positive kya ho saktaa he ki ham karodon rupee kii imaarat banaakar istemaal nahin karte hai, librari kii marammat nahin karte hai, class main professor nahin rakhte, phir bhi karodon chaatr inhen uniwarsity se har saal paas hote hai

 First, teach without a master in college so that they remain unemployed for a lifetime, if any of them still read and write, then do not let them become master in any case
 mumbai uniwarsity main 86 professor hone chahie magar hai sirf 35

 The system of filling the online form has come to the university, but due to lack of network, many students are unable to fill the form
 jiske kaaran kai chaatr ek hi class main 2-2 saal se atak gaye hai
 Because you cannot give exams due to not filling the online form

 Some colleges have computer labs but labs are not open at all
 netaa aate hai or lab kaa udghaatan karke chale jate hai
 The headline is printed in the newspaper that Digital India is done

 Sohit has gone ahead and brought this picture for you

 The building was completed in 2012, inaugurated in 2015 but has not received NOC

 The university pictures we have shown are all positive stories

 It cannot be a big positive story

 The Governor ordered that the result should be declared by 31 August

 Seeing the way the posts are vacant here, it seems that there are two stages of the policies of the governments
 pehle to college main bagaiyr master ke padhaao taaki ve aaajeevan berojgaar bane rahe, agar inamen se koi phir bhi pard-likh letaa he to inhen kisi bhi haal main master mat banane do
 There should be 86 professors at Mumbai University but only 35
 professor ke 51 pad khaali hai

 The leaders come and inaugurate the lab and leave

 This news has appeared because the degree of phd in Kolhan University was first distributed and examination was taken later
 akhbaar main chapa he ki kolhaan uniwarsity ke pariksha niyantrak ne 8 sitambar, 2017 ko ek ajeebogarib adhisuchana jari kii
 In this, orders were also issued to researchers who have obtained phd degree to apply for the coursework examination

 It is important that we and you remain entangled with the issue of Taj Mahal so that the arrangements continue to fool us

 saansad adarsh gram yojana ko sahi tareeke se lagu karnaa endie sarkaar ke liye ek chunauti bana hua he
 According to the Ministry of Rural Development, at present there are 112 mps who have not selected any Gram Panchayat under the Sansad Adarsh gram Yojana till date
 pichley saal 11 oktober ko pradhanmantri narendra modi ne saansad adarsh gram yojana launch kii thi
 At that time it was decided that all the mps would choose a Gram Panchayat in their respective areas within a month by 11 November (2014) which would be developed as Adarsh gram by 2016
 lekin gramin vikaas mantralay ke mutabik is vakt 112 saansad aise hai jinhone saansad adarsh gram yojana ke tahat kisi gram panchayat kaa chayan nahin kiya he
 Some mps fear that if they choose one village in their area, then people from other villages falling in the area will get angry with them

 Also, paying more attention to one village may offend others, causing a sense of envy in them
 aisa karnaa raajnneetik drushtikon se uchit nahin hoga
 Every MP who does not choose a village has his own argument - somewhere the reason is political, somewhere administrative
 lekin iskaa nateeja ye hua he ki is yojana ko lagu karne ke liye jo dedline thi wo peeche chhuti ja rahi he or iske torget ko puraa karnaa mushkil hota ja rahaa he
 On October 11 last year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the Saansad Adarsh gram Yojana
 us vakt ye tay kiya gaya tha ki sabhi saansad ek maheene ke andar 11 november (2014) tak apane-apane ilaake main ek gram panchayat kaa chayan karenge jise 2016 tak adarsh gram ke taur par viksit kiya jayega
 But according to the Ministry of Rural Development, at present there are 112 mps who have not selected any Gram Panchayat under the Sansad Adarsh gram Yojana
 kuch saansadon ko dar he ki agar unhone apane ilaake main kisi ek gaanv ta chayan kiya to ilaake main padane vaale duusare gaanvon ke log unke naaraaz ho jaaenge
 According to government data, the worst condition of the MP Adarsh gram Yojana is in West Bengal

 It would not be appropriate to do so from a political point of view

 On the occasion of the book's release, he mentioned how Bapu had opposed Japan's attack on China during World War II
 us samay mahatma ne japan ke logon ko likhe patr main kaha tha, ‘aap log samrajyavaadee mahatvakanksha se jakad chuke hai

 pradhanmantri narendra modi ke netritv main duusari baar centre main bani sarkaar kii sansadeey pariksha somvaar se shuru ho rahi he
 The Parliament session of the second term of the Modi government will begin on Monday i
e
 June 17 and will run till July 26
 40 dinon tak chalane vaale sansad ke is satr main kai mahatvapurn vidheyakon ko paas karaane kii chunauti hogi
 The government will introduce several important bills like triple talaq, central educational institution reservation and citizenship amendment in the budget session
 loksabhaa main sarkaar ke paas paryaapt sankhya bal hone ke chalate yah bill sansad ke nichle sadan main aasaani se paas ho jaaenge, lekin rajyasabha se paarit karnaa sabase badi chunauti hogi
 The triple talaq bill is the second most important triple talaq bill in the Modi government's agenda
 yahi vajah he ki sarkaar ne cabinet kii pehali baithak main muslim mahilaon ko teen talaak se nijaat dilaane ke liye ordinance ko manjuuri di he, jiske baad ab ise loksabhaa main pesh karegi
 Although in 2017, the government passed this bill related to the rights of Muslim women from the Lok Sabha but could not be passed by the Rajya Sabha and the bill was sent back by the Upper House
 iske baad sarkaar iske liye adhyadesh bhi lekar ai thi, jo 17veen loksabhaa ke gathan ke baad swaabhaavik rup se nirast ho gaya
 This is the reason that ordinance involving triple talaq at one time was approved in the cabinet meeting chaired by PM Narendra Modi
 isamen vipaksh kii kuch maangon ko bhi shaamil kiya gaya he
 In fact, in the last session when the government introduced this bill in the Rajya Sabha on the last day, the opposition did not allow the bill to pass, saying that the government has introduced this bill in very haste without everyone's consent
 ab ise sansad ke bajet satr main modi sarkaar pesh karegi, dekhnaa he ki sanshodhan ke baad kya yah vidheyak donon sadanon se paas ho sakegaa
 Jammu and Kashmir Reservation Bill: The Narendra Modi government will introduce the Jammu and Kashmir Reservation Bill 2019 in the budget session
 is bill se jammu-kashmir main antarrashtriya seemaa ke paas rahane vaale logon ko raahat milegi
 In the first meeting of the cabinet, the Modi government has amended it through ordinance
 darasal, cabinet ne aarakshan ke liye vahaan 1954 ke raashtrapati aadesh main badlaav kar aarakshan ke praavdhaan main pherbadal kiya he
 Under this, people living along the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir as well as those living on the international border will get the benefit of reservation
 iske alaava garibon ko milane vaala 10 fisadi aarakshan bhi lagu hoga or saath hi essi, asti or obisi aarakshan bhi lagu hoga
 The Modi government has again issued an ordinance in the Cabinet on the roster dispute over appointment of Central Educational Institution Reservation Bill University
 iske baad ab sarkaar kendriya shaikshanik santhaan aarakshan vidheyak ko loksabhaa main pesh karegi
 This will also restore the old system 200 point roster
 iske tahat vibhaag yaa vishay kii bajaae vishvavidhyalay yaa college ko ek unit mana jayega
 With this decision, while filling more than 7000 vacancies under direct recruitment in the teacher cadre, it will be ensured that SC, ST and OBC can get the benefit of reservation
 naagarikta sanshodhan bilanaagarikta se judaa sanshodhan bill bhi sarkaar kii top list main he, lekin is bill ko pichley kaarykaal main sansad se manjuuri nahin mil saki he
 In 2016, the government introduced this bill in the Lok Sabha, but then it was referred to the Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC)
 ab sarkaar ise dobaaraa se sansad main laaegi
 Surrogacy Regulation Billmodi government had brought this bill in the year 2016 with a view to stop the misuse of surrogacy
 janvari 2017 main bill loksabhaa main pesh bhi kiya gaya lekin tamaam aapattiyon ke baad is bill ko standing cameti ke paas bhej diya gaya tha, tab se yah bill sansad main lataka hua he
 The government had passed this bill from the Lok Sabha, but could not pass it from the Rajya Sabha
 aise main 17veen loksabhaa ke gathan ke baad sarkaar duusari baar yah bill laa sakati he
 In the Women's Reservation Bill, the bill related to providing 33 percent reservation for women in Parliament and legislatures has been hanging for nearly 22 years
 saal 2010 main is bill ko upie sarkaar ke dauraan rajyasabha se paarit kara liya gaya tha lekin loksabhaa main samaajawaadee party, bispi or rashtriya janata dal jaise dalon ke virodh kii vajah se ye bill paas nahin ho sakaa
 The bill was first introduced by the HD Deve Gowda government in 1996 and was strongly opposed by many male mps
 aise main mahila aarakshan vidheyak ko paarit karaane kii maang lekar congress modi sarkaar par dabaav bana sakati he
 However, the Modi government could not take steps in this direction in the last five years
 jabaki loksabhaa main uske paas bahumat tha or is baar paryaapt sankhya he
 In this way, it can be assumed that the Women's Reservation Bill is in the court of Modi government
 bataa den ki modi sarkaar in vidheyakon ke alaava indian medical council sanshodhan, company or banning of anaregulated diposit skim jaise tamaam bill he
 In such a situation, it has to be seen that the Modi government is successful in passing all the bills in this budget session
 patiyon kii aisi bahut si aadaten hoti hai jo patniyon ko pasand nahin aatin
 These things are very small, but sometimes they reach such a level where a situation of quarrel arises between two people
 ek khushhaal vaivaahik jivan ke liye ye bahut jaruri he ki pati-patni ye samajhen ki unke partner ko kis baat se khushi milti he or kis baat par use gussa aata he
 Knowing this thing is as important for the husband as it is for the wife as well
 ye aisi hi paanch baaten he jinase mahilaon ko sabase adhik chidh hoti he
 If you also say something like this to your wife
 
 
 1
 You are looking good but not as beautiful as my mother
 agar aap apni patni ko tang karnaa chaahate hai to isse zyada or kuch kehane kii jarurat hi nahin he
 It should not happen that you get so upset by saying this again and again that you should stop asking about yourself
 2
 Do you know how it feels when you praise your friends' wives? Most men do not know that women are strongly hated by these things and they do not like to hear any other woman's praise from their husband's mouth
 3
 In many homes, it happens that as soon as the men return home from office, they sit down with a TV remot
 yaa phir patni ke pasandida dharawahik ko jhat se badal dete hai
 Do you know how angry your wife is at this habit? 4
 zyaadaatar purushon main ye aadat hoti he ki wo apana saamaan vyavasthit tareeke se nahin rakhte hai
 Wet towel on the bed, dirty socks under the couch and don't know what
 ghar ko sajaakar rakhane vaali patni ko pati kii ye aadat bilkul bhi pasand nahin aati he
 5
 apni galati sweekaar nahin karnaa
 Many times it happens that the person in front knows that he is wrong, but he does not accept it
 purushon kii galati sweekaar nahin karne kii aadat se bhi mahilaon ko bahut pareshaani hoti he

 cristan ke is andaaj ko kans kii NO FLATS POLICY kaa virodh karne ke taur par dekha ja rahaa he
 Explain that there is an unwanted rule in Cannes that no flats will come in footwear on the red carpet

 Many veterans have termed this policy of Cannes as absurd
 cristan bhi apane ek intervyuu main is kanoon kaa virodh kar chuki hai
 Perhaps this is why Kristen now chose the Cannes Red Carpet as the right platform to oppose it
 NO FLATS POLICY se jude ye vivaad 'flatsget' ke naam se surkhiyon main rahaa
