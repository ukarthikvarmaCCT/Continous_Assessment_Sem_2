 2005 main abhijit group kii sthapana kii
 The group whose companies were allocated a total of six coal blocks
 sabhi block ko jod den to koyale kaa stock kul 444 million ton he
 Perhaps it was Manoj Jaiswal's influence that five out of six blocks of Jharkhand were given to him

 Many big officers retired from government jobs have been giving their service to this group
 haalanki koyala mantri shriprakash jaiswal ne manoj jaiswal se apane rishte kii baat ko khaarij kiya he lekin, donon kii nazadiqiyaan saaf hai
 It is being said that due to these close proximity, he was given coal blocks
 donon jaiswal parivaar kanpur se hai or donon kii sasuraal kolkata main he
 Relationships are also said to be from the in-laws' side
 sibiai ne jin logon or companiyon ke kilaaf exiaar darj kii he unamem darda parivaar ke alaava navabharat group bhi he
 The CBI has told in its charge sheet how these people got these coal blocks by forging them
 udyogpati or ek akhbaar gharaane ke maalik vijay darda congress ke saansad hai
 His brother Rajendra Darda is the Minister of School Education in the Government of Maharashtra
 phir bhi sibiai ne un par haath daalane kii himmat dikhaai to isliye ki sibiai ke daawey ke mutabik uske paas gadabadi ke pukhta saboot hai
 According to the CBI, Darda and his family had applied for six blocks to hide that they already had coal blocks or else they could not be entitled to acquire coal blocks
 isiilie sibiai ne inke kilaaf jaalsaaji kaa maamla banaaya he
 The comments sibiai ne apni exiaar main kai or companiyon kii gadabadi ke taur tareeke kaa zikr kiya he
 For instance, Navbharat Power, while applying for the block, showed its financial standing at Rs 1 lakh crore based on a short-term mou with two international power companies
 unhone singapore kii ek company se 90 din kaa emoyu dikhaakar odisha main do block hasil kiye
 Then he had shown his net worth of 2000 crores
 iske baad company ne ek duusari global company ke saath emoyu dikhaaya jisaki net worth ek lakh karod rupee thi
 However, there were no documents to substantiate Navbharata's claim
 sibiai is baat kii bhi jaanch kar rahi he ki pramotars ne license lene ke baad kaise ratorat munaafaa banaaya
 In the case of Navbharat, the company's directors Trivikrama Prasad and y Harishchandra Prasad sold the controlling stake to Essar Power and made a profit of over 200 crore
 baaki companiyon ne bhi yahi tareeqa akhriyaar kiya
 The CBI is also going to file an FIR and FIR in this case soon
 march 2012 main aasraa bank ne apane das fisadi yaa 1,28,000 share saat companiyon ko 8882 rupee prati share ke hisaab se beche or 113 karod rupee banaae

 Among the people and companies that the CBI has filed firs, apart from the Darda family, there is the Navbharat Group
 sibiai ne apni chargeshit main bataaya he ki in logon ne kis tarah jaalsaaji kar ye kol block hasil kiye
 Vijay Darda, an industrialist and owner of a newspaper house, is a Congress MP
 unke bhai rajendra darda maharashtra sarkaar main schuli shiksha mantri hai
 Even then, the CBI dared to lay hands on him because it claimed that he had strong evidence of wrongdoing
 sibiai ke mutabik darda or uske parivaar ne chah blox ke liye arzi dete hue ye baat chupa lee thi ki uske paas pehle se hi kol block hai varanaa ve kol block hasil karne ke haqadaar nahin rah pate
 That is why the CBI has made a case of forgery against them
 tippaniyan The CBI has mentioned in its FIR the manner in which several other companies have been disturbed
 misaal ke taur par navabharat power ne block ke liye arzi dete vakt do antarrashtriya bijli companiyon ke saath short turm emoyu ke aadhaar par apni aarthik haisiyat ek lakh karod kii dikhaai
 He acquired two blocks in Odisha by showing a 90-day mou from a Singapore-based company
 tab unhone apni net worth 2000 karod kii dikhaai thi
 After this, the company showed an mou with another global company which had a net worth of Rs 1 lakh crore
 lekin, navabharat ke daawey ko sabit karne ke liye koi dastauez nahin the
 The CBI is also investigating how the promoters made profits overnight after obtaining the license
 navabharat ke maamle main company ke nideshkon trivikrama prasad or vaai harishchandra prasad ne essar power ko controling steke beche or 200 karod se zyada kaa munaafaa banaaya
 The rest of the companies adopted the same approach
 sibiai is maamle main jald or exiaar bhi darj karne ja rahi he
 However, the Darda family, without spending a single penny, made Rs 113 crore from a coal block and project that was not yet on the ground
 or vah bhi koyala vivaad shuru hone se sirf chaar maheene pehle
 That too by selling only 10% shares
 iskaa matlab he company kii kul haisiyat 1130 karod kii ho gai
 Many of the five companies that the CBI raided in the coal allocation dispute belong to Abhijeet Group of Manoj Jaiswal of Nagpur
 53 saal ke manoj kii mahima kam nahin
 Both Jaiswal families are from Kanpur
 or donon ke hi sasuraal kolkata main hai
 Relationships are also said to be from the in-laws' side
 nagpur ke abhijit group kii kai companiyaan bijli, sadaken, mining, steel, cement or toll collection main kaam karti hai
 Manoj is the second son of Basant Lal Shaw, the owner of Nagpur-based engineering company Neco, for three decades serving his father's company, but later Manoj chose his own path
 2005 main abhijit group kii sthapana kii
 The group whose companies were allocated a total of six coal blocks
 sabhi block ko jod den to koyale kaa stock kul 444 million ton he
 Perhaps it was Manoj Jaiswal's influence that five out of six blocks of Jharkhand were given to him
 bade netaaon se nijee dosti rakhane vaale manoj kii rajyasabha saansad vijay darda se nazadikiyaan chhipi nahin hai
 Darda has attended his family function as a family member
 manoj kai mauqon par vijay darda ko apana maardarshak bataa chuke hai
 Manoj is associated with Darda's JLD Power Yavatmal
 to manoj kii eemr aayran and steel naamak jis company ke kilaaf sibiai ne exiaar daayar kii, usase darda ke bhi sambandh bataae gaye hai
 Together, this color has come forth from the coal mines and shown on the playgrounds
 vijay darda ne ek sthaneey footbal toornament karaayaa
 Manoj's team also landed in it
 naam he abhijeet liance
 Manoj, who appeared in Page Three's photographs, bought a hundred-crore Bombardier Challenger 605 last year
 abhijit group kaa mining kaarobaar videshon tak failaa he
 Many big officers retired from government jobs have been giving their service to this group
 haalanki koyala mantri shriprakash jaiswal ne manoj jaiswal se apane rishte kii baat ko khaarij kiya he lekin, donon kii nazadiqiyaan saaf hai
 It is being said that due to these close proximity, he was given coal blocks

 Relationships are also said to be from the in-laws' side
 sibiai ne jin logon or companiyon ke kilaaf exiaar darj kii he unamem darda parivaar ke alaava navabharat group bhi he
 The CBI has told in its charge sheet how these people got these coal blocks by forging them
 udyogpati or ek akhbaar gharaane ke maalik vijay darda congress ke saansad hai
 His brother Rajendra Darda is the Minister of School Education in the Government of Maharashtra
 phir bhi sibiai ne un par haath daalane kii himmat dikhaai to isliye ki sibiai ke daawey ke mutabik uske paas gadabadi ke pukhta saboot hai
 According to the CBI, Darda and his family had applied for six blocks to hide that they already had coal blocks or else they could not be entitled to acquire coal blocks
 isiilie sibiai ne inke kilaaf jaalsaaji kaa maamla banaaya he
 The comments sibiai ne apni exiaar main kai or companiyon kii gadabadi ke taur tareeke kaa zikr kiya he
 For instance, Navbharat Power, while applying for the block, showed its financial standing at Rs 1 lakh crore based on a short-term mou with two international power companies
 unhone singapore kii ek company se 90 din kaa emoyu dikhaakar odisha main do block hasil kiye
 Then he had shown his net worth of 2000 crores
 iske baad company ne ek duusari global company ke saath emoyu dikhaaya jisaki net worth ek lakh karod rupee thi
 However, there were no documents to substantiate Navbharata's claim
 sibiai is baat kii bhi jaanch kar rahi he ki pramotars ne license lene ke baad kaise ratorat munaafaa banaaya
 In the case of Navbharat, the company's directors Trivikrama Prasad and y Harishchandra Prasad sold the controlling stake to Essar Power and made a profit of over 200 crore
 baaki companiyon ne bhi yahi tareeqa akhriyaar kiya
 The CBI is also going to file an FIR and FIR in this case soon

 What is the reason for the death of seven pilgrims in the attack on Amarnath pilgrims? Is this attack a threat to the Valley? This question is because the way the terrorists targeted Amarnath pilgrims after 15 years in the valley, it is clear that they have broken their unwritten rules regarding the Amarnath Yatra, the rule not to target the pilgrims
 kyonki ghati main aatankwaadiyon kii ladaai kathith taur par kashmir ko aaazaad karaane ko lekar he, jisase tirthayatriyon kaa koi lenaa dena nahin he
 Amarnath Yatra Shared Tradition Amarnath Yatra is considered as Kashmir's shared heritage and age-old tradition, which is not possible without the local people, but this visit also provides employment to thousands of Muslim families of the valley but the attack on common heritage has shown directly
 That the pilgrims have now come under the target of terrorists
 is hamale se saaf he ki aatankwaadiyon ke bich bhi dhade bant gaye hai, jinamein se ek dhade ke liye ladaai aar-paar kii he or iske liye wo ghati ke muslim pulisavaalon se lekar tirthayatriyon tak ko nishaanaa banane ke liye taiyaar he
 There were also intelligence reports that the aim of the terrorists is to target at least 150 devotees, that is, to remind the country of the year 2000 when the Amarnath Yatra was first targeted
 us hamale main 80 logon kii jaan chali gai thi or us hamale ke baad ghati saham gai thi
 The first attempt was made in 1993, the first attempt to target the yatra was in the 1990s when terror was on the rise in the valley
 1993 main aatanki sanghathan harakat-ul-ansaar ne is yatra par hamale kii koshish kii thi
 Also announced a ban on Amarnath Yatra
 is sanghathan ne apane kadam ko babari maszid dhahaae jane ke virodh main kii gai karrwai bataaya
 But this plan could not succeed due to lack of help from local terrorists
 saal 2000 main aatanki apane mansoobon main kaamyaab ho gaye
 Then in 2001 and 2002, the terrorists targeted the Amarnath Yatra, but since then the unwritten rule of not targeting the pilgrims was followed
 15 baras baad ab ye niyam tutaa he to matlab bahut saaf he ki ghati main aatank kii nai aahat nae niyam ke saath ho rahi he, or sawaal yahi he ki sarkaar ke paas isse nipatane ke kya koi intjaam hai? Vacancy has come out in the National Highway Authority of India

 pustak saar: videshon main based bharatiyon kii aakankshaon or samvednaa kaa bayaan karti kahaniyanhamaare desh main videsh kii lalak bahut zyada he
 Be it foreign goods or foreign guests
 jabaki is pahalu kaa ek aisa sach he jisaki ore najar nahin jaati
 But there are some people who have the talent to see the tragedy behind the laughing face
 mridula garg kaa shumaar aise hi logon main kiya jaataa he
 It is his poignant effort to get everything done
 isamen unhone un logon ko tatola he, jinka taalluk kisi na kisi rup main videsh se he
 In this collection of 12 stories, Garg with great simplicity carries the emotion with which a large population of our country is living
 phir chaahe vah kisi ke liye enarai duulhe kii chahat ho yaa phir videshi jameen par ja based apravasi, jo apni jadon ke najadik aane ke liye har dam chatpataate rahete hai
 They are far from the limits of India, but a Hindustaniyat breathes every moment in their heart
 shaike or vivaahya or ''agar yon hota'' kahani ke kirdaaron main garg ne ek aisi stri ke man ko tatola he, jo khud se us dansh ko nahin nikaal paati jisase use apane vajood ke kho jane kaa bhram ho chukaa he
 But the story "returning and returning" is an accurate depiction of the mindset of a Hindustani parent and his foreign-born son who shocks the reader with all his heart
 to ''urf sam'' kaa kirdaar apni majaburi se takaraane kii bajaae usase bachane ke bahaane dhundta dikhaai detaa he
 In the stories of Indians living in far off countries, Garg has given his style and storyline so much that we drift into it
 shabdon kii ruparekha or chote-chote vaakya kai baar bahut tikhe ho jate hai, jo lekhika ke man ke udgaaron kii gavaahi dete hai
 The incident is from 1993
 jodhpur ke mahendra lodha ghar se choupasni road sthit apane offis ja rahe the
 Then an accident occurred
 sadak par chal rahi lunaa ko tej gati se aa rahe ek trek ne takkar maari or faraar ho gaya
 The couple riding on Luna bled
 lodha paas gaye to dekha ki pati kii maut ho chuki thi or patni behosh thi
 That scene continued to roam all day before Lodha's eyes
 aise haadase dobaaraa na hon, iske liye kya kiya jaae? is sawaal ko lekar unhone kai dinon tak maathapai kii
 For this, heavy vehicles should not enter the city, for this he wrote several times from collector to divisional commissioner but all was useless
 tab unhen upaay soojha: janhit yachika
 This petition proved to be the Brahmastra to change the picture of Jodhpur
 aaj unhen shahar kii kayapalat karaane vaale ek yoddha ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 During the hearing of a petition, he went on to apply a dozen applications one by one and decisions were made on some of them
 is saal 14 farvari ko unhone sambhageeya ayukta, jila colector, nagar nigam ke kaaryakari adhikari samet kai sambandhit afasaron ke khilaaf ek avmaananaa yachika daayar kii
 Contempt of Supreme Court directives
 adaalat ne 2007 main polithine khaakar marate or shahar ko ganda karte gaay, boar or kute aadi jaanwaron ko shahar ke baahar shift karne ke nirdesh die the
 But the responsible officers did nothing
 is maamle main jodhpur hycourt ke mukhya nyaayadhish arun mishra or kailashchandra joshi kii khandpeeth ne sambandhit afasaron ko 4 hafte main jawaab dene ke nirdesh die the, jisaki miyaad kaaphi pehle nikal chuki he
 Soon the mechanism will be exposed once again during the hearing on the matter
 baharhaal, baari vaahanon ke pravesh par roak ke liye 1993 main jodhpur hycourt main lagaai unki pehali yachika par faisla unke paksh main aayaa lekin isamen saat saal lag gaye
 This was also the reason
 adaalat ne un tamaam sarkari sansthaaon ko talab kiya jo apni jimmedaari se lagaataar bhaag rahi thim
 The verdict was blunt: No heavy vehicles should enter the city from 7 am to 10 pm and transport companies should be taken outside the city to the Basni area
 dhithaayee kii had dekhie, transport companiyon ko basani kshetra main plot pehle hi alot ho chuke the par ve manamaani se shahar main jameen raheen
 Transporters went to a double bench against the verdict and later to the Supreme Court
 har jagah unhen haar mili
 This decision relieved the city of a major problem
 property dling kaa kaam kar chuke lodha ab janhit yachika kii dhar ko jaan chuke the
 To pass heavy vehicles through the bypass it was necessary to have a good road in the form of a bypass
 adaalat ne 48 kimi lambii sadak banane ke aadesh die
 39 km of road has been built so far
 aadesh kaa danda sena ke baari vaahanon par bhi chalaa, jo shahar main apni marji se khadey hote the
 Orders were made to widen the city's Pal Road to 200 feet
 philhal yah 150 foot chaudee ho chuki he
 The rest is in the possession of encroachers
 shahar main sadakon par gaadiyaan khadi na hon, iske liye yahi koi 145 parking place bane
 The multi-storey buildings being built in the city were also hit, which were still being erected at the will of the builders
 yah dekhakar to adaalat ko bhi jhtka laga ki kya jodhpur itnaa bada shahar ho gaya, jahaan yahaan parking chat par kerani pade
 On this, a high-powered committee was formed on the direction of the court
 unki yachika par ek faisle main nyaayamurti en

" isi yachika ke tahat 15 saal se zyada puraani city bason va texiyon ke shahar main daudane par pabandi laga di gai taaki pradooshan na bade

" '' jodhpur hycourt ke vakil es
 P
 sharma unke sankalp kii daad dete hai, ''yachika daayar karne ke baad bhi lodha shant nahin baithe
 At his level he continued to explore
 paksh main aane vaale faisle apane aap main iske gavaah hai
 After this, Lodha petitioned a ban on the growing commercial activities in Shastri Nagar, an elite area
 2003 main adaalat kaa faisla ek baar phir unke paksh main aayaa
 Chief Justice Anil Dev Singh ordered a stay on the increasing commercial activities in the residential area
 lodha kii maane to shahar ke baahar 2,500 bigha jameen aawaara pashuon ke liye or 500 bigha pine ke pani ke talab ke liye arakshit he
 Lodha ends his talk somewhat: "if government officials do not listen, what better option than a public interest litigation?" Ask the people of Jodhpur

 Gold is considered a safe investment in the event of other assets such as stocks not performing well
 unhone kaha ki rupee main giravat or ucch vaishvik keemat ke kaaran sone kii gharelu dar par asar hua
 Apart from this, the increase in import duty by four percent helped in increasing the price

 Shiv Sena has given full support to the statement containing the burqa of Narendra Modi
 shivasena netaa uddhav thakare ne kaha he ki narendra modi ne kuch bhi galat nahin kaha
 His statements have been misinterpreted
 uddhav thakare ne somvaar ko kaha ki modi ke burka vaale bayaan main galat kya he? is par bavaal karne jaisaa kuch nahin he
 Modi's statement has been taken incorrectly
 uddhav ne kaha ki congress ek duubataa hua jahaaj he or is party ke netaa asli muddon se dhyaan hataane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 Read: 'the burqa of secularism' is better than communalism: Congress on Sunday, addressing a public meeting in Pune, attacked the Congress and said that whenever that party is in crisis, the burqa of secularism will be worn and the bunker i hide narendra modi ke burka vaale bayaan ko virdohi dalon ne turant aade haathon liya or narendra modi ke saath-saath unki party ko bhi nishaanaa banaaya
 The Congress, the CPI and the JDU, once part of the NDA, have also strongly criticized Modi's statement

 It was in the mid-1950s when Chinese President Xi Jinping's father Xi Zhangshun met the young Dalai Lama of Tibet in Peking and the two became friends
 dalai lamas ne unhen ek ghadi bhent kii thi jo ve 1980 tak pahante rahe the
 This was confirmed by an Ambassador of the Dalai Lama when he met Xi in Beijing at the time
 in bich ke varshon main shi jhangashun ko maao ke krantikariyon ne akelaa chhod diya tha or unke bete ko siiron kii dekhbhaal karne ke liye ek gupha main bhej diya gaya tha
 Xi Zhangshun saved himself and his son emerged one day as the most powerful in the Communist Party of China
 california main rahane vaale shashakt tibeti samudaay ke bich 6 july ko apana 80waan janmdin manaane ke liye dalai lamas is hafte jab america ja rahe the, to raste main unhone india today se ek khaas baatcheet main bataaya ki ve apane ghar tibet waapas jane kii ichha rakhte hai or unki ichha apane dost shi jhangashun ke bete raashtrapati shi jinping se milane kii bhi he
 Given the signals that the Dalai Lama has sent to the Chinese government through this two-way conversation, some people may say that this is the clearest statement of interest in resuming talks with Beijing
 beshak, tibet ke is netaa ne apane logon ke hit main ek sammanjanak samjhaute kii guhaar lagaai he, jinhen 1950 main china ke jabaran kabje ke baad se lagaataar kai dashakon tak pratadit or kalankit kiya gaya he
 Some others may conclude on the basis of this conversation that the Dalai Lama has no more options and this statement is an indirect admission
 yaa phir yah bhi ho saktaa he ki ve khule main apane saare pattey yah jaanate-boojhte hue bikher rahe hon ki 1959 main jab bhagkar ve bharat aae the, tab se lekar aaj kii taarikh main china kahin zyada taqatvar or paise vaala ho gaya he
 Strategic analysts may be of the opinion that this is not a sensible move, it cannot be expected from another spiritual master to anticipate the Shatranji moves of a communist leader who has spent the last two years of his presidency in the Chinese The army has occupied six important positions within the party, economy and the state
 yah muqabla agar tibeti buddha dhara ke sabase pavitra vyaktitv tengine gyatso or shi jinping ke bich hota to ham kah sakate the ki muqabla shuru hone se pehle hi khatm ho chukaa he, lekin aisa nahin he
 The Dalai Lama has not only refused to accept the Chinese as his most bitter opponent, raising this most unusual challenge, but he is actually relying on the support of a growing number of Chinese Buddhists who are "atheists from outside but within Are spiritual
 ”& unke mutabik jinaki sankhya nagarikon or sainya pratishthan main kul milakar 40 karod ke aasapaas he or yah sankhya unke or tibetiyon ke paksh main satta kaa santulan jhukaane ke liye paryaapt he
 a special kind of resentment is still prevalent in China about this aging monk wearing a deep brown cloak
 vahaan unhen har tarah kii gaaliyaan di gai hai
 The Chinese have pressurized governments, threatened civil society, and threatened voluntary organizations to stop hosting the Dalai Lama or to stop the spread of their peculiar discourses such as peace, happiness and brotherhood
 If they do something, their cooperation will be withdrawn
 dalai lamas haalanki aaj apni umr ke 80wein padaav par bhi ek rockstar bane hue hai or baraak obama se lekar richard gere or desmund tutu tak har prabhaavshaalee vyakti unhen baraabar sammaan detaa he
 The fact is that the Dalai Lama has single-handedly brought legitimacy and recognition to the world in a scattered movement started in exile in 1959, as well as the only person in the world who can lovingly suppress the weak vein of the Chinese
 apana naam na chhapane kii shart par china main bharat ke ek purv rajdoot kehete hai, “bhale hi unhone dashakon pehle tibet ko chhod diya tha, lekin vahaan unke chaahane waalon kii taadaad kaaphi badi he
 The Communist Party of China cannot accept any organization or leadership other than itself, whose base is so large
 ”bhikshu ke saath man kii batdilachasp baat he ki dalai lamas ke bare main chiniyon jitna sashankit duniya main sirf ek or netaa he or uskaa naam narendra modi he
 There was a meeting between Modi and the Dalai Lama on August 20, 2014, before Xi Jinping's Delhi visit in September last year, which is believed to have been uneasy
 bharat sarkaar ke sutron ne india today ko bataaya ki us shaam dalai lamas ko “takreeban apahrit” karke kaale shishe vaali ek anjaan car main baitaakar pradhanmantri ke awaas 7 rescorse tak le jaaya gaya tha
 When asked about this meeting, the Dalai Lama laughably refused to say anything
 sutron kii maane to is mulaakaat se ve “hill gaye” the
 It seems that Modi did not come out to pick him up, as other prime ministers have been doing before
 iske alaava ve unase hindi main baat karte rahe jiskaa anuwaad angreji main kiya gaya
 The Dalai Lama kept on answering in English
 un donon ne china samet tamaam masalon par baat kii
 It is said that the Dalai Lama, his advisor and a Chinese businessman friend of his living in Hong Kong, were considering the possibility of his meeting with the Dalai Lama during his visit to Delhi
 mana ja rahaa he ki sarkaar is ghatnakram se khush nahin thi or usne dalai lamas ke logon tak apni raay pahunchaa di thi
 Obviously, a lot has changed in Delhi in the last one year
 nae pradhanmantri ko itihaas ke adhure adhyyon ko puraa karne kaa ehsaas he or ve bharat ke sabase bade padosi desh ke saath achche rishte bananaa chaahate hai, khaskar audyogic nivesh ko lekar unki chintaaen badi hai
 The Prime Minister also knows that a lasting relationship with China cannot leave the question of the Dalai Lama and the exiled Tibetan community incomplete
 isaki vajah bharat ke kootnithik jakhire main kathith “tibet card” naam kaa hathiyaar nahin he, jis par vaise bhi dalai lamas ke aagaman ke baad ke dashakon ke dauraan dilli main pani phir chukaa he, balki isliye kyonki china kaa netritv dalai lamas ko apni pramukh communist pahchaan ke liye hi bada khatra maan rahaa he, jo uske liye khaas mahatv kaa he
 It is believed that the Dalai Lama's exodus from Tibet in 1959 not only worsened the deteriorating relations between India and China, but also led to a border dispute in 1962 and continued tension in subsequent decades
 yah aaj tak jari he
 Today, once again China is on its rise, there is a renewed nationalist uprising against the opposing cultures of Tibet and Xinjiang
 china main bharat ke ek purv rajanyik nalin suri kehete hai, “dalai lamas ko lekar china kii mukhya samasya yah he ki vah chahta he ki ve sweekaar kar len ki tibet hameshaa se china kaa abhinn ang rahaa he
 No Dalai Lama can accept it because it is a historically disputed fact
 ”hindi chini bhai bhai part-2agast 2014 main dalai lamas se hui mulaakaat main modi shaayad yah soch rahe honge ki shi ke saath ve jo nayaa rishta banane ja rahe hai, usamen ek 80 saal kaa boodha tibeti netaa anaavashyak rup se khatai daal degaa, jisase vaise bhi china ke log nafrat karnaa pasand karte hai or jo is desh main rah rahaa he
 Whatever may be the truth, but it is being said that Modi's interactions with the Chinese leadership in Ahmedabad, Delhi, Xian and Beijing have given him an opportunity to get into the bottom of complicated relations with this giant neighbor and a special view
 Has helped build
 bharat main bahupratikshit aarthik nivesh ko badhaane main china kaaphi utsahit najar aa rahaa he lekin haal ke varshon main usne seemaa vivaad par ek “yathasthitivaadee samaadhaan” ko sangyaan main lene se inkaar kiya he&vah yah, ki bharat or china apane-apane ilaakon ko apane niyantran main hi rakhen yani kramshah arunachal pradesh or aksai chin ko, jaisaa ki ateet main do baar jhau en laai or deng shiyao ping ne tay kiya tha
 Instead China has been insisting that any agreement with India will be possible only with some other part of Arunachal including Tawang
 jaahir he, china ke hawaale kuch ilaake karne kii rajnatik kuwwat ek aisi majboot sarkaar main hi ho sakati he jiske paas paryaapt bahumat ho
 In the era of Atal Bihari Vajpayee, there was often talk of a "soft border" between Tawang and Tibet and it was similar to the proposal to convert the loc into a "soft border" in Jammu and Kashmir which soon died its natural death
 donon deshon ke pratinidhiyon ke bich 2003 se lekar ab tak 18 daur kii vaarta ho chuki he lekin koi nateeja nahin niklaa he
 During this period, China's economy has grown manifold, which has not only rejuvenated the east coast, but has also changed the picture of the interior of China
 pehali baar beijing se lhasa kii train 2006 main shuru hone ke baad communist party ne tibet ke shaharon main haan chiniyon ko basaanaa shuru kar diya
 In August 2013, the Indian Air Force landed its C-130J Hercules aircraft at Daulat Beg Oldi, the world's highest aircraft base in the Ladakh sector bordering China
 ek avkaash praapt bhartiya rajanyik kehete hai, “is harakat ne china ko behad chaukanna kar diya
 "other airstrips lying idle after use since the 1962 debacle were repaired
 yah kaam pashchimi sector main chushul or purvi sector main tejpur par kiya gaya or yahaan sukhoi ladaaku vimaan tainaat kar die gaye
 a retired foreign secretary says, "the question is, how can you play a game with more powerful Chinese with weak stakes?" The answer is that you should deploy your firepower in those places which are known to the Chinese as well
 ”mandarin bhashaa jaanane vaale purv videsh sachiv shyaam saran maanate hai ki dalai lamas ne “bharat main ek vishisht aadhyatmik viraasat ko waapas laane kaa kaam kiya he jo bich kii sadiyon main gaayab ho gai thi or ham usase vanchit ho gaye the
 We cannot assess the importance or value of the Dalai Lama in terms of political gains or losses
 itane baras unke yahaan rah jane ke baad main garv ke saath unke bare main kah saktaa hum ki ve bhi ab bharat ke hi hai
 "modi and BJP president Amit Shah, who canceled the scheduled meeting with the Dalai Lama on the eve of their visit to China in May, now seem to be reconsidering their staunch opinions
" macleodganj main 21 june ko hue dalai lamas ke janmdiwas samaaroh par modi ne kendriya samskruti mantri mahesh sharma or kendriya grih rajyamantri kiran rigiju ko bheja tha
 Sharma said, “the government would like to assure His Holiness that he gives him the highest honor
 ”india today ke saath apni baatcheet ke ant main dalai lamas ne sanket diya ki ve shaayad dalai lamas kii parampara main aakhri honge, jahaan yah parampara apane aap khatm ho jaaegi
 He says that it would be far better to dismantle the 600-year-old institution with him (since he is quite popular) rather than "continue it with the 15th Dalai Lama that does not tarnish the institution
" ”apni is tippanee ke baad ve bacchon kii tarah khulkar hanse, lekin ve bheetar se bahut gambhir the
 He was probably making all these comments keeping Beijing in mind so that he could be denied for insulting another holy institution
 china ke saath chhadam yuddh ke is khel main dalai lamas ke paksh main kuch bhi nahin dikhataa, lekin is tathy ko nazarandaaj nahin kiya ja saktaa ki ve ab bhi 80 saal ke hai, hans-bol rahe hai or apane shrotaaon ko nagarjun jaise nalanda ke darshanikon ke sandeshon kii ore pravrutt karne main lagaataar jute hue hai
 Perhaps this is the real value of his years spent in India and in the rest of the free world

 buudhvaar ko bijepi ke piem pad ke ummidavaar narendra modi ne teen reliyaan kii jisamen mukhya rup se nishane par rahe arvind kejariwal
 But Modi's target in Delhi rally was Rahul Gandhi and Congress party along with Kejriwal
 dilli ke silampur main yojit raily main congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi par nishaanaa sadhate hue modi ne kaha ki shahjade ko loktantr main vishwaas nahin he
 Modi slammed the Congress for declaring Madhusudan Mistry as Congress candidate in place of Narendra Rawat in front of Vadodara Lok Sabha seat of Gujarat and accused him of insulting Dalit leader Rawat
 vadodara loksabhaa seat se ravat kii jagah mistre ko ummidavaar banaaye jane par modi ne aarope lagaaya ki congress ne aisa karke ek dalit kaa apmaan kiya he
 The Chief Minister of Gujarat said that Rawat was removed only because he is a Dalit
 modi ne sawaal kiya ki kya dalit hona gunaah he
 On Tuesday, Narendra Rawat, who was unanimously elected as a candidate through the primary system of Rahul Gandhi's preferred arrangement to fight Vadodara seat against Modi, withdrew his candidature
 unhone kaha tha, ‘apni ummidavaari waapas lene se pehle maine congress ke rajya prabharee gurudas kaamat, kendriya mantri gulam nabi aaazaad or anya varisht netaaon samet party netritv ke saath charchaa kii
 Rawat said, "although i was selected through the primary which is Rahul Gandhi's favorite project, i withdrew my name because the equations changed after Modi chose Vadodara as the second Lok Sabha seat
" ’ congress netritv ne rahul gandhi ke kareebi sahyogi madhusudan mistre ko vadodara seat se apana ummidavaar ghoshit kiya tha
 Targeting Congress, Modi said, 'congress did not spend even a single rupee for Muslims
 congress ne musalamaanon ke peeth main chhura ghonpa or dhokhebaajon ke liye dilli main jagah nahin he
 The time has come to remove the fraudsters from politics
 ' congress ke ghoshnaptr par karaara prahaar karte hue modi ne kaha, is ghoshnaptr main janata kaa makhul udaaya gaya he
 Did not fulfill the promises that were made earlier
 'kejariwal par hamalaa bolte hue gujarat ke mukhmantri ne kaha, 'jo log raat ko camera waalon ko lekar rain baseraa jaakar adhikariyon ko daant lagaate the, aaj kahaan hai
 He said that there is a complete lack of maturity among them
 galati to maaf ho jaati he, dhokhe ko puraa desh maaf nahin karegaa
 The bjp's PM candidate called the Aam Aadmi Party as the b Party of the Congress
 modi ne kaha ki yamuna paar kii haalat behad kharaab he, yahaan ke logon ko isse behatar vyavastha milani chahie
 Parents are not safe in Delhi
 unhone dilli ke logon se yahaan kii sabhi 7 siten bijepi kii jholii main daalane kii apil kii
 Modi accused the UPA government that he allotted 1000 crores for the Nirbhaya Fund but did not spend a single penny
 mahilaayein ab bhi surakshit nahin hai
 The Congress is not only throwing dust in the eyes of the people but it is also blowing chilly
 modi ne dilli main kaha aapako tay karnaa he ki kiski sarkaar chahie
 In 10 years, no such destruction has happened in any other government of the country
 upie sarkaar har morche par vifal rahi
 He said, UPA government's ego is so high that they cannot see anything below

 Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has given an open challenge to Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the midst of the growing electoral counting in Bihar

 Addressing the election meeting, Nitish said, 'I never called Bihar developed
 main vikaas ke mudde par pradhanmantri se kabhi bhi or kahin bhi bahes ke liye taiyaar hum
 It is shameful that he talks about the development of Gujarat where people are malnourished
 'endie kii ore se siem pratyaashee kii ghoshnaa nahin karne ko mudda banaate hue nitish ne kaha, 'aakhir pradhanmantri or amit shah bihar main apane mukhyamantri pad ke ummivaar kii ghoshnaa kyon nahin kar rahe hai
 It has been heard that only BJP candidates from Dinara will be the contenders for the post of CM
 agar aisa he to rajendra singh ko sime pad kaa ummidavaar kyon ghoshit nahin kiya ja rahaa
 "panchayat elections to be led by PM", targeting the BJP and the Prime Minister, Nitish said that it seems as if the Prime Minister is contesting in Bihar
 nitish ne kaha, 'kya pradhanmantri bihar ke mukhyamantri banenge? mujhe to aisa lag rahaa he jaise bijepi bihar main aglaa panchayat chunaav bhi pradhanmantri ke netritv main ladegi
 Nitish said that while there is unity in the Grand Alliance and everything is fixed, there is nothing in the NDA

 30-year-old Sunita Jain from Ratlam had a dream to go into administrative service
 is sapane ko puraa karne ke liye usne raat-din ek kar die the
 The family also believed that the hard work of five years would be sweet
 lekin madhya pradesh lok seva ayog (empipiessi) kii 2005 main yojit 'praarambhik pariksha 2003' main safal rahi jain ko mukhya pariksha ke baad intervyuu kol nahin aayaa
 After the interview was over in May 2007, when the list of marks came, the ground slipped under Sunita's feet
 mukhya pariksha main 2,100 main se 1,240 ank paane vaale ashish mishra ko to intervyuu main bulaayaa gaya tha jabaki 1,249 ank vaali sunita ko bulaava nahin bheja gaya
 Sunita wrote a letter to the Commission asking the reason for this
 is par ayog ne haroonges jawaab main bataaya ki mahila varg ke cat of marks purush varg se alag hote hai or unke marks mahila varg ke cat of se kam the, isliye unhen intervyuu ke liye nahin bulaayaa gaya
 In fact, in 1997, 30 percent women reservation was implemented in the state for the empowerment of women
 lekin ayog ke ajab-gajab niyamon ke kaaran mahila aarakshan kaa asal laabh purushon ko mil rahaa he
 Like Sunita in MPPSC 2003, 67 women candidates were not called for interview due to the separate list of women and men, while male candidates with less marks were called
 mahilaon ko apane saath hue is anyaay kii bhanak tak nahin
 The reasoning of the Commission for making separate list was that merit list of different category candidates also becomes different
 aarakshan ke kaaran mahilaon kii alag list bani or intervyuu letters bhi arakshit padon kii sankhya ke anusaar hi bheje gaye
 So, after the number of women was complete, many women candidates whose marks were more than men were not called for interview
 sunita kahati hai, ''is tarah to mahilaon kii adhiktam sankhya tay kar purushon ko aarakshan diya gaya
 Retired Judge of Madhya Pradesh High Court V
 ke
 "reservation has been arranged to provide additional benefits, but the Commission's decision seems to be at a disadvantage," says Aggarwal
 ''is visangati kii gunj vidhansabha main bhi sunai di
 In the information given in the Legislative Assembly on the question of MLA Paras Saklecha, the Commission has admitted that the cut-off marks of unreserved women in the 2003 examination was 1,251, so that women with less marks were not called in the interview while the cut-off marks of the male category was 1,231
 That is, men who got less marks than women were given the chance to appear in the interview
 sakalechaa kehete hai, ''mahilaon ko aarakshan kaa laabh to mil nahin rahaa balki niyamon kii aad main unka nuksaan kiya ja rahaa he
 '' Now Chairman of the Commission A
 ke
 Pandey shies away from talking to the media while Secretary M
K
 ke
 "I will tell by looking at the record," says Aggarwal
 ''ayog ne sakalechaa ke patr ke jawaab main 1 janvari, 1995 se lagu rulls of prosijar ko iskaa kaaran bataaya he
 Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan himself has also stated the same reason, according to which, in any category, three times the total number of posts are called in the interview and the final invited candidate's marks are cut off for that class
 sunita ne agast, 2007 main madhya pradesh hycourt main maamla daayar kiya tha, jis par adaalat ne ayog ko nirdesh diya tha ki intervyuu chal rahe hon to usamen sunita ko shaamil kiya jaae
 But by then the results were also announced
 isliye nyaayamurti je
 K
 maheshwari ne sunita ko merit shrenee kii ummidavaar maanakar ayog ko aagaamee aadesh tak ek pad khaali rakhane ko kaha
 This petition was pending for three years and Justice S, who replaced Maheshwari
 si
 Sharma dismissed Sunita's plea on the basis of rules of procedure
 har ore se niraash ho chukin sunita ne paristhitiyon se samjhauta kar liya he
 Now she is teaching as a guest teacher in Kendriya Vidyalaya
 sunita kii yachika khaarij hone se isi anyaay kaa shikaar hui anya mahila abhyarthiyon ke liye bhi daravaaje band ho gaye hai
 If this matter goes ahead, perhaps other women candidates would also fight for their rights, but ironically they will say that they do not even know about the deception
 sunita ladaai haar gayi or anyaay kaa silsilaa jari rahaa
 In the 2005 State Service Examination, the cut-off for women was 1,226 while for men it was 1,212
 2008 kii pariksha main saamaanya shrenee kii 1,170 ank laane vaali mahilaon ko bhi intervyuu ke liye nahin bulaayaa gaya jabaki 1,143 ank paane vaale purushon ko bulaayaa gaya
 The same happened to women belonging to scheduled castes and tribes
 anusuchit jati varg kii mahila ko 1,105 ank par intervyuu kaa bulaava aayaa jabaki anusuchit jan jati purush 1,094 ank par hi bula liye gaye
 Tribal women were called at 961 and men at 941
 visangati sirf intervyuu letters bhejne main hi nahin balki antim chayan main bhi he
 Women coming to the merit are also facing loss of reservation
 aisa isliye kyonki merit main aane ke baavjood unhen arakshit padon par hi chunaa jaataa he
 Commission Secretary Aggarwal Saaf says, "as per the instructions of the government, 30% of the women coming in merit are included in the reservation
 ''darasal empipiessi ne 30 may, 1997 ko saamaanya prashasan vibhaag se yah saaf karne ko kaha tha ki merit ke aadhaar par purush aavedak se upar sthaan paane vaali mahila ko anarakshit pad ke viruddh gina janaa chahie yaa mahilaon ke liye arakshit padon kii sankhya main gina janaa chahie? jawaab main saamaanya prashasan vibhaag ke avar sachiv ke
 L
 dikshit ne ayog ke sachiv ko salaah di thi ki chuni gai mahilaon ko 30 fisadi aarakshan ke daayre main hi gina jaae
 The commission prepares the list on the basis of this
 nyaayamurti agarwal kehete hai, ''aarakshan niyamon ke mutabik merit main aane vaale kisi bhi shrenee ke abhyarthi ko arakshit shrenee main shaamil nahin kiya jaataa
 But this is what happened, due to which many talented women had to negotiate with the post
 misaalen dekhiehrajya seva pariksha 2009 ke parinaamon kii ghoshnaa 2 farvari ko hui he
 In this, three women of the general category came in merit, who were elected to the reserved post
 isi vajah se anya teen mahilaayein richa naugaraia, ritu dvivedi or nujahat bano bakaai dipti colector pad paane se rah gayi
 In the 2008 ADPO examination, 30 out of 100 posts were for women in the unreserved category
 isamen 13 mahilaayein merit main ain lekin unhen arakshit pad par hi chunaa gaya
 Because of this, the other 13 women had to come on the supplement list
 is tarah 70 pad purushon ke liye arakshit ho gaye
 There were 46 posts of unreserved category in the 2009 recruitment of Assistant Director Farmers Welfare and Agricultural Development

 This incident of attack on the police clearly indicates the high spirits of the criminals

 In such a situation, how will the common people be protected? The BJP government with a strong majority has appointed Kataria, close to the RSS as Home Minister, after the cabinet expansion
 kataaria raajnneeti ke chaske main duube hai or bekhauf apradhi chaaron ore aatank machaae hue hai

 The BJP has tasted negative results in the state by-elections after coming to power

 He is not digesting this internal decision of India
 wo itane pareshaan hai ki imran apni 90 pratishat twits main bharat par hi nishaanaa sadhate rah gaye
 On August 5, the Central Government repealed Article 370 and divided Jammu and Kashmir into two Union Territories
 tab se pakistan ke pradhanmantri imran khan baukhalaaye hue hai, ve baar baar apane bhaashanon or twits main bharat ke khilaaf baaten karte nazar aa rahe hai
 The India Today Data Intelligence Unit analyzed the tweets of Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan from August 5 to September 1 and found that 90 percent of Imran's tweets were focused on India during this period
 kashmir or modi par nishaanaa5 agast se 1 sitambar tak imran khan ne kul 67 baar twit kiye
 Of these, 60 tweets (90 per cent) were focused on India
 in 60 twits main bhi 49 kashmir par kendrit the
 Imran Khan used the word Kashmir most - 35 times
 kashmir ke baad unhone 'duniya' (27), 'adhikrut' (20), 'kashmiriyon' (20), 'bharat' (20), 'modi' (17), 'vichaardhaara' (16), 'musalmaan' (14), aresas (12), 'ioke' [IOK] (12) or 'hindu' (11) kaa zikr kiya
 If the figure of Kashmir and its corresponding words, 'kashmiri', 'kashmiris', 'india Occupied Kashmir' (IOK) (as he wrote) reaches 76
 sirf kashmir hi nahin aise kai twit hai
 In which Imran Khan targets Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 unhone sirf kashmir ke liye hi nahin, enarasi ke liye bhi modi par tanj ksaa
 He even compared the ideology of the National Service Association (RSS) to Hitler's Nazi Germany
 khan ne apane twits se bharat main sampradayik jehar gholne kii bhi koshish kii
 While addressing Muslims, they mostly show them as victims and they used to use words like Hindu and RSS frequently
 modi nahin dete pakistan ko tavajjoisi dauraan pradhanmantri narendra modi ne pakistan or uske pradhanmantri ko koi tavajjo nahin di
 An assessment of the Prime Minister's tweets suggests that 'pakistan', 'imran Khan' were not mentioned even once in his tweets
 pradhanmantri modi ne 46 twits main jammu kashmir or ladakh kaa kai bhashaaon main zikr kiya, lekin inamen se kisi ek twit main bhi unhone pakistan yaa imran par koi baat kahi
 Prime Minister Modi's tweets on Kashmir were very popular till 5 August and beyond, but by the end of August, his number had reduced, there was a similar situation on Independence Day
 Meanwhile, in the month of August, Pakistan's Independence Day was also towards Imran
 Tension was seen from DIU ne apni padtaal main paaya tha ki 14 agast ko pakistan adhikrut kashmir kii rajdhani muzzafarabad main imran khan ke bhaashan main kashmir, naji, aresas, jaise shabdon kii bharmaar thi lekin pradhanmantri modi ne pakistan or imran khan kaa naam ek baar bhi nahin liya

 Pakistan's controversial fast bowler Muhammad Asif on Monday left the Delhi Daredevils team of the Indian Premier League with immediate effect, citing personal reasons
 asif ne kaha ki main nijee kaarnon se yah kadam uthaa rahaa hum or nishchit taur par iske liye aagrah karnaa aasaan nahin rahaa kyonki meraa agle do seshan ke liye anubandh tha, jisase mujhe kaaphi vittiya laabh hota
 Asif, however, did not mention anything about the future renewal of the contract
 pakistan ke is tej gendbaaj ko ipel ke pehle seshan kii samaapti ke baad swadesh lautate samay dubai main nashile padaarth ke saath pakadaa gaya tha
 He had several meetings with Delhi Daredevils officials over the last two days, after which both sides agreed to free him
 asif ne kaha ki abhi mujh par chaaron taraf se baari dabaav he or mujhe khud hi in samasyaon se nibtakar phir se dhyaan kendrit karne kii jarurat he
 He said that my only aim is to play for my country Pakistan again and for this i need to separate myself from any kind of cricket and concentrate only on that
 telugana sarkaar kaa kahana he ki agar hyderabad main kanoon-vyavastha se sambandhit vishesh shaktiyaan rajyapal ko saunpe jane sambandhi nirdesh waapas nahin liye gaye to vah kanoon kaa sahaara legi
 However, the state government also said that it does not want any confrontation with the Center
 rajya ke soochna praudyogiki or panchayat raaj mantri keti rama raav ne grih mantralay ke 8 agast ke patr ko 'asaamaanya sthiti' qaraar diya
 Chandrasekhar Rao's son
 mantri ne kaha, 'ham centre sarkaar ke saath takaraav nahin chaahate, lekin agar centre ne apane vichaar thope to rajya sarkaar ke paas kanoonee sahaara lene ke alaava koi vikalp nahin hoga
 He said that what legal measures the state government will take for this will be clarified in the coming days
 rama raav ne kaha ki kanoon-vyavastha rajya kaa vishay he
 The violation of the rights of any elected state government by the Center is detrimental to the federal sentiment
 keti rama raav ne aage kaha ki mukhyamantri ne shanivaar ko pradhanmantri narendra modi ko patr likhakar unase us aadesh ko waapas lene kii maang kii
 He hoped that Modi would respond positively
 rama raav ne kaha ki andhrapradesh punargathan adhinium ko is saal 18 farvari ko paarit kiya gaya or telugana rajya 2 june ko astitv main aayaa
 Not a single untoward incident has occurred since then
 aise main centre sarkaar kii vartmaan pahal samaj se pare he
 He further said, 'the Telangana government has allocated more than Rs 400 crore to strengthen security measures and improve the law and order situation in Hyderabad
 hamaara maananaa he ki yah dishanirdesh piemo kii jaankaree ke bagaiyr aayaa hoga
 There may be such a possibility

 Premium charges apply !! uttar pradesh main afasarshahi kii manamaani or afasaron ke sarvice conduct,yogi sarkaarake liye sar dard bane hue hai
 When the Yogi government made the ADG of Gorakhpur to the IPS officer, who was missing from the job for 4 years, questions started about the functioning of the bureaucracy
 91 batch ke ipies daawa sherpa 2008 se 2012 tak sarkaar se gaayab rahe
 It turned out that he had gone to his home district Darjeeling to try his luck in politics, from where he wanted to contest on a BJP ticket
 uttar pradesh ke grih vibhaag ke sutron ke mutabik daawa sherpa ne viares kaa aavedan diya or vah bijepi kii raajnneeti karne waapas darjeeling chale gaye, lekin 2009 main unhen tikat nahin mila
 After that he joined the All India Gorkha Land League and started doing politics in the state
 2009 me mahakme main hangaamaa hone par unhone apana istipha diya tha, lekin unka istipha manjuur nahin hua, naa hi unka viares manjuur hua
 Till 2012, he was not involved in politics
 jab vah waapas naukarshahi main aae to pradesh kii sarkaar ne unhen diaiji ke rup main jwine karaayaa
 After getting promotion in Akhilesh government, he became IG and then ADG
 ab yogi sarkaar ne unhe posting dete hue gorakhpur kaa ediji banaaya he
 In this case, BJP spokesperson Manish Shukla said that when Dawa Sherpa left the job, there was the UPA government at the center
 jab laute tab bhi centre main upie kii sarkaar thi or rajya main akhilesh kii sarkaar thi
 Why did i not accept the resignation viares dene par dobaaraa kaise jwining hui
 Both these people can tell all these things
 rahi baat hamaari to hamaari sarkaar ne sirf unki posting kii he
 Where Dawa Sherpa was from 2004 to 2008, it can better tell the old government
 lekin itnaa jarur kah sakate hai ki maamla sangyaan main aane par sarkaar isaki jaanch jarur karengi
 The case of Dawa Sherpa may be the only case in itself, but in the last few days, many other officers have defeated the government through social media
 bareli ke dm aar vikram singh kii ek post se hangaamaa much gaya tha jab unhone kasganj hinsa ke baad Facebook post par tirangaa yatra ko lekar tippanee kii thi
 The post of Saharanpur deputy director Statistics Rashmi created further uproar when she wrote about the tricolor trip on her post as well
 in adhikariyon ke post se sarkaar kii kirakiri hui
 Although both the officers removed their posts, they have been served notice from the government
 vipaksh kah rahaa he in adhikariyon ne koi galati nahin kii kii he
 The fault lies with the government which is communicating the administration
 taaja maamla amethi ke ek or pisies adhikari kaa he jisamen unhone yogi sarkaar main ho rahe lambii-lambii meeting ke bare main fasebuk post likhaa he
 In which it is written that if there will be such a meeting, when will the work be done
 bavaal machane par unhone apni post hataa lee he, lekin sarkaar kii kirakiri jarur kara di
 It is clear that the bureaucracy which used to remain in its purview till now, limited its service conduct to one radius
 soshal media ke is daur main unke dard or unki raay saamne aa rahi he
 This is proving to be the biggest headache for the government
 deepika padukon-ranvir singh donon ke liye is baar kii holi bahut khaas he
 Actually, this is the first Holi of both the stars after marriage

 Due to this, the actress will not be on the celebration of Holi with husband Ranveer after marriage

 sushmita sen 1994 main miss univers kaa khitaab jeetne vaali pehali bhartiya mahila hai
 Sushmita Sen made all of India proud with this title in her name
 ab unhone miss univers jeetne ke dauraan kaa ek dilachasp kisse ko saajha kiya he
 He told that a moment had come when i thought that my dream of becoming Miss Universe would be broken
 ek intervyuu main sushmita sen ne bataaya, "philippines main miss univers contest ke liye jane se pehle meraa passport kho gaya tha
 Actually, Mera's passport was lost to event manager Anupama Verma
 bangladesh main ek sho ke liye unke paas meraa passport tha
 He needed it for ID proof
 isliye maine bahut aatmavishvaas se kaha ki chintaa na karen ki meraa passport anupama verma ke paas bahut surakshit he
 But when Anupama started looking for passports, he could not find them
 unke paas se passport kho gaya tha
 Later, Anupama herself took responsibility for this mistake
 "sushmita sen ne bataaya, "passport khone kii vajah se main behad niraash ho gai thim

 i was told that it is difficult to get a passport ready so soon
 miss world november main he
 You will get your passport till you go later
 "sushmita ne kaha- "maine apane papa ko iske bare main bataaya
 However, he was unable to do anything about it as he did not have connections with dignitaries
 main bahut pareshaan ho gai thi
 Cried in front of my father and i said, Baba, i am not going for anything else

 After this, Papa talked to Rajesh Pilot

 vampanth shasit tripura main sipiai (em) ne apane netaa samar acharya ko party se nikaal diya he jise tivi par noton kii gaddiyon par sota hua dikhaaya gaya tha
 In this video created by himself, the leader is also seen allegedly saying that he is not like other leftist leaders who earn crores but still pretend to be 'poor'
 gauratlab he ki tivi par prasaarit ek video main makapa kii jogendranagar samiti ke sadsy evam peshey se thekedaar rahe samar acharya ko noton kii gaddiyon par lete hue dikhaaya gaya tha
 In this video, Acharya is saying, 'I took out 20 lakh rupees from my bank account and fulfilled my years old dream of sleeping on a bed of notes
 ’ beete guuruuvaar ko prasaarit is video main makapa netaa ne iske saath hi kaha ki vah party ke anya sadasyon kii tarah paakhandee nahin hai, jo khud to dheron dhan dabaae baithe hai or khud ko sarvhaara ke taur par dikhaate hai
 CPI-M Secretary of State Bijan Dhar said, "initial investigations conducted by the party reveal that Acharya himself took the video from his mobile phone which his friend leaked to a television channel
 ’ dhar ne kaha ki party kii agartala sadar sambhageeya samiti ne jaanch puri kar lee he
 He said, 'we do not support such immoral acts
 aisa lagata he ki unke khilaaf ucchtam sambhav dandatmak karrwai kii jaaegi
 ' maukey kaa phayda uthaate hue rajya kii vipakshi congress party ke varisht netaa ratan laal nath ne vampanthi netaaon or mantriyon kii chal achal sampattiyon kii jaanch karaane kii maang kii he
 Nath said, 'this incident shows that that party is corrupt and its leaders have earned immense wealth by misusing public money
 ’ But the Lieutenant Governor also expressed surprise at this decision of the Kejriwal government and said that the first elected government had brought the point of sale system with curiosity so that the ration is reaching the right people
 uparajyapal ne kaha ki 'dilli sarkaar dwaara i-pos kii shuruyaat ek sahi kadam tha jisase yah sunishchit kiya ja saktaa tha ki yogya labhaarthiyon ko hi rashan mil sake or isamen bhatkaav na ho
 The department also found that 98 by e-posh devices within 2 months of the introduction of e-pos equipment

 ' The Bahujan Samaj Party and the Janata Congress are blowing the election bugle in Bilaspur, Chhattisgarh through a joint rally today
 mayawatijit jogiki raily kai myanon main mahatvapurn he
 In order to register their strong presence in the assembly elections, both the parties have set a target of gathering five lakh people in the rally
 mayawati is raily ke madhyam se apni party ko vot katwa ke label se jahaan mukt karana chaahati hai, vahiin ajit jogi apane upar lagabijepiki bi-team hone kaa dhabba saaf karnaa chaahate hai
 In the alliance between Mayawati and Jogi, 35 seats have come to the account of Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and Janata Congress has got 55 seats
 dalit-adivasee gathjodjatigat sameekaran ke lihaaj se dekha jaae to jogi ke paas jahaan adivasee vot kii takat he, vahiin basapa ke paas dalit matadaataaon kaa khaasaa samarthan he
 In such a situation, this Congress may have to bear the brunt of contesting elections separately from the BSP, there are also strong doubts about this
 siyaasi galiyaaron main charchaa ye bhi he ki congress ko is gathjod se ek-dedh darjan siton par nuksaan pahunchane kii ashanka he
 Kanshi Ram's political debut from Chhattisgarh BSP founder Kanshi Ram also started his political innings from Chhattisgarh
 1984 ke aam chunaav main kanshiram ne jaanjgir loksabhaa seat par ek nirdaleey ke taur par chunaav ladaa tha
 Just 8 of them in this election
 81 fisadi vot mili tha or unhen shikast jhelni padi thi
 While Congress candidate Prabhat Kumar Mishra 58
 61 fisadi vot pate hue jeet hasil kii thi
 On 1 November 2000, Chhattisgarh was carved out of Madhya Pradesh as a new state
 2003 main hue pehle rajya vidhansabha chunaav main bispi ne 54 siton par chunaav ladaa, jinamein use sirf 2 siton par hi jeet hasil hui or mahaj 4
 45 percent votes were received
 sirf 54 siton kii baat karen to yahaan bispi ko 6
 11 percent votes were received
 2013 main sabhi siton par ladi bispi2013 ke chunaav main bispi ne sabhi 90 siton par chunaav ladaa, lekin is chunaav main uskaa vot pratishat or bhi kam ho gaya
 Just 4 to BSP
 27 fisadi mat mili or uske tikat par ek hi vidhayak nirvaachit ho paaya
 The interesting fact is that both Mayawati and Ajit Jogi claim to be the messiahs of the Scheduled Castes
 is baar donon ne haath milaayaa he
 Based on the population of Chhattisgarh, 10 seats are reserved for Scheduled Castes
 in 10 siton main se 9 par maujuuda samay main camel khilaa hua he
 The Congress candidate won on the remaining one seat
 ab raajnneetik panditon kaa maananaa he ki nayaa gathbandhan koi phayda kar saktaa he to vah bijepi kii sambhaavnaaon ko nuksaan pahunchaakar hi sambhav haijatigat samikarnchhattisgarh main 31
 8 percent voters are from tribal community and 11
 6 fisadi voter dalit hai
 About 43 together with both communities
 4 fisadi vot hote hai, jo kisi bhi party ko satta main pahunchane ke liye kaaphi ahm hai
 In view of this, BSP and Ajit Jogi have formed an alliance
 ek dilachasp aankada ye bhi he ki congress pichley teen chunaav main mahaj ek se dedh pratishat voton ke antar se hi satta ganvaati rahi he
 Equation of reserved seats Actually, both BJP and Congress won 4-4 seats of SC in 2003 election
 jabaki bispi ne essi ke liye arakshit 2 siton par kabja kiya tha
 Similarly in the 2008 elections, BJP had won 5 seats, while Congress had won 4 seats
 is chunaav main bispi ko keval ek hi vidhayak essi seat se jeeta tha
 In the 2003 elections, former leader Vidya Charan Shukla joined the NCP, rebelling against the Congress just before the election
 unhone 7
 Had secured 09 per cent votes, because of Shukla, the Congress lost this election and has been sitting in the opposition for the last 15 years
 congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ne ajit jogi ko chhattisgarh kaa pehla mukhyamantri banaaya tha, jabaki unke paas paryaapt saport bhi nahin tha
 This was the reason that Shukla revolted
 iske baad hue 3 chunaavon main bijepi ke haathon congress ko haar kaa munh dekhnaa padaa
 The Congress leadership of the state blamed Jogi's three-year government for the consecutive defeats
 ab ek baar phir unka mayawati se haath milaanaa, congress ke liye khatre kii ghanti ban saktaa he
 According to the alliance agreement, the BSP will contest 35 seats for the 90-member assembly while the JCCJ will contest 55 seats
 ajit jogi ko gathbandhan main mukhyamantri pad kaa ummidavaar banaaya gaya he
 The most gruesome encounter of recent years took place on April 1 in Shopian, 60 km from Srinagar
 sena, ardhsainik balon or police kii is saajha karrwai main 13 aatanki maare gaye
 Paderpura, a township with a population of about 150 people near the site of the encounter, suffered more shock as three of the slain terrorists were from this village
 laga ki paderpura gaanv ke aatank ke saath teen dashak puraane rishte or uski dushwariyon kaa yaheen khaatmaa ho jayega
 But exactly 17 days later the news of the disappearance of Abid Nazir, another 20-year-old young man from the village itself
 vah punjab ke jalandhar se civil ejineering kii padhai kar rahaa tha
 Abid aspired to join the army (he also passed the National Defense Academy or NDA exam in 2016)
 uskaa parivaar sipiem kaa kattar samarthak he
 Abid was also involved in the funeral of the slain terrorists of his village
 uske gaayab hone ke ek din baad hi fasebuk or whatsap par uski tasviren post huin, jisamen vah haath main rifl thame jang ko taiyaar dikhaai diya
 His new place there was written: Hizbul Mujahideen
 aabid ke bade bhai or sipiem kaaryakarta imran nazeer kehete hai, ''bas uuparavaala hi jaanata he ki aakhir uske dimag main kya chal rahaa tha
 "he says that his brother had never shown inclination towards terrorism even a little bit
" unka parivaar sthaneey aatankiyon kii dhamkee ke chalate andhera hone se pehle hi ghar waapas aa jaaya karata tha
 In Imran's own words, "abba often stays away from home so that terrorists are not targeted
" ''aisi kahaniyaan ab kashmir ghati main aam hoti ja rahi hai
 Young and even teenage boys have now left their homes and started turning to terrorism
 july 2016 main hijbul ke charchit commander burhan vaani ke maare jane ke baad se yah pravriti zyada dekhi ja rahi he
 Local people are getting more recruited in terrorist organizations and this is happening when the security forces have started the offensive action against the terrorists last year and also operation at night
 marane vaale aatankiyon kii badhati sankhya or unki shavyatra main umadti bheed dekhakar shaayad yuva hathiyaar uthaane kii prerana paa rahe hai
 Take a look at these facts - People's Democratic Party (PDP) - In the first year of the formation of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government, 66 youths joined terrorist organizations
 2016 main yah sankhya badhkar 88 or 2017 main 126 ho gai
 In the first four months of this year too, 48 local youth have joined terrorist organizations
 ek april ko shopiyaan main hue encounter ke baad se 16 ladakon kaa koi ata-pataa nahin he
 Abid Nazir is one of the 16 boys
 aabid jaisi kahani bahut-se pariwaron kii hai jinke bacchon ne aatank kii raah chun lee he
 When the main political party, especially the PDP, took the reins of the BJP in 2014, Mohammad Afzal Wani of Dehuna village in Anantnag turned active activist of the political party, defying the election boycott of the terrorists
 vaani gaanv main sakriy jamaat-e-islamic kaa mukharata se virodh karte hue bhaajapa main shaamil ho gaye
 Out of the 11 votes cast in Dehruna village during the election, five were cast by Vani's family members
 unka betaa jubair is faisle se bahut naaraaz tha
 On 21 April this year, Zubair left his ancestral home in the village saying that he was going to take a state level teacher recruitment examination in Srinagar
 lekin jaldi hi uskaa mobile number pahunch se baahar ho gaya
 Twenty-four hours later, a photo of him appeared on social media in which he held the Kalashnikov rifle in his hands
 jubair ke man main pehle se hi gussa bharaa tha kyonki ek april ko encounter main maare gaye hijbul mujahidin ke aatanki rauf khande kii shavyatra main umadi bheed ne use hathiyaar uthaane ke liye protsaahit kiya
 His mother says that Zubair cannot be a terrorist
 uske aatanki banane kii khabar se ve hairaan hai
 She says, "zubair was looking for a job
 vah naayab tehseeldaar shikshak banane ke liye bhartee pariksha kii taiyaari kar rahaa tha
 He was always studying
 namaaj ke alaava or kabhi ghar se baahar nikalataa bhi na tha
 "his father does not hide his connections with the BJP
" vaani sweekaar karte hai ki ''maine apane chote bete ko bhaajapa pratyaashee ke liye poling agent banaaya
 i thought they would help my son get a job
 lekin hamen sirf dhokhaa mila
 "his face clearly shows that he feels cheated
" jubair ke dost use behatar jaanate the
 He does not want to reveal his name, but about Zubair, he says that he was a "conservative Muslim" who always said that Kashmir needs a political solution
 ''srinagar main dastagir sahib kii majaar ke bahut paas rahane vaale patharbaj 18 saal ke fahd mushtak waja ne 23 march ko ghar chhod diya or lashkar-e-taiyaba main shaamil ho gaya
 He comes from a family of active activists of the National Conference whose main occupation has been to prepare Vajwan, a traditional dish cooked at Kashmiri weddings
 uske bade bhai umr mushtak neshnal conference chhodkar congress se judye kaa man bana rahe the lekin fahd ke chale jane se unhone apana iraadaa philhal badal diya he
 Omar says, "it would not be right to do so now
" fahd mujhase hameshaa mukhyadhara kii raajnneeti se jude hone ko lekar bahes kiya karata tha
 "her distraught Ammi has requested a video appeal to return
" footbal khilaadi se aatanki bana maajid khan apni maa kii iltijaa par aatank se munh modakar laut aayaa tha or jisaki khub charchaa bhi hui thi, usase ulat fahd ne maa kii apil kaa koi jawaab nahin diya
 Police officials say that the manner in which Majid, who had left behind the path of terror, was let down on social media, perhaps because of this the silence on the appeal of Fahad Maa has remained tight
 paderpura main maare gaye aatankiyon main hijbul mujahidin kaa sheersh commander ishafa majid thokar bhi tha
 Ishfaq was also involved in the murder of young army officer Lieutenant Omar Fayaz
 faiyaz shopiyaan ke batpora gaanv main ek rishtedaar kii shaadi main shaamil hone gaye the
 From there he was kidnapped and murdered
 2015 main ishafa ke aatanki banane se pehle uske pita abdul majid pidipi ke sakriy kaaryakarta the
 In the last three years, his family has lost a lot due to terrorism
 abdul majid kehete hai, ''main ab vot nahin daaloongaa
 We have given blood, we will not do it business
 ''jammu-kashmir police ke ek varisht adhikari halaat ko 'chintajanak' qaraar dete hue kehete hai ki yah sthiti keval dakshini kashmir kshetra tak simatakar nahin rahane vaali
 Pointing to the encounter in Srinagar and elsewhere, he says, "terrorism has now spread throughout the Kashmir Valley
 ''5 may ko ek muthbhed main lashkar ke teen aatanki maare gaye
 The encounter lasted for more than four hours in the Chattabal area of srinagar, on the banks of the Jhelum
 maare gaye logon main ek saal pehle aatanki bana srinagar kaa yuva faiyaz ahamed hammaal bhi shaamil tha
 That evening, a large crowd of mourners gathered in Idgah graveyard in Srinagar, in which many youths appeared quite angry
 police or siarpief kii gadibhan dekhakar gussaye yuvaaon ne patharbaji shuru kar di
 With the darkness darkened when Fayaz's body was placed in the tomb, some terrorists arrived and opened fire to pay their companions a final salute
 halaat teji se badal rahe hai
 In the last four months, 34 Kashmiri militants have been killed by security forces but 48 new people have taken up arms
 police adhikari kehete hai ki aatanki sanghathanon main bhartee hone vaale nae ladakon ko ghati main maujuud lashkar-e-taiyaba or jaish-e-mohammad ke aatankiyon se hathiyaar chalaane kii buniyadi training bhar di jaati he
 This is why they do not last long in encounters
 to ve aatanki kyon ban rahe hai? rajya ke police mahanideshak shesh paul vaid kehete hai, ''aisa isliye ho rahaa he kyonki aaj kashmir main har koi aatankwaad kaa mahimamandan kar rahaa he
 "but there are many reasons besides this
 pidipi ke youth wing ke adhyaksh wahid-ur-rahamaan kaa maananaa he ki kashmiri yuva puure desh ko sandesh dene kaa kaam kar rahe hai
 They attribute the increasing attacks on Kashmiris as the biggest reason
 rahamaan kehete hai, ''pehle dilli police kii special cell, police, siarpief or sena kashmiriyon par shaq karne or unhen hiraasat main lene main juty rahati thi
 Today you will see that common people have started beating and mistreating Kashmiris (students) in places like Mewar University, Lucknow University
 yuvaaon ko aisa lagane laga he ki ve avaanchit hai
 They do not need a negotiator to talk to Kashmiris, but rather a big negotiator who can talk to the country
 ''mirwij umr faruk kaa kahana he ki sarkaar yuvaaon ko darkinar karne kii niti par chal rahi he or maujuuda halaat usee kaa nateeja hai
 He points to things like tightening the screws on the Hurriyat, curbing student politics, and saying that youths are being constantly put under restriction for engaging in normal activities
 iske kaaran kashmiri yuvaaon kaa aatanki sanghathanon ke prati rujhaan badha he
 "the PDP and the National Conference are responsible for this because they mislead the country by telling them that everything is fine here," says Mirwaiz
 chharra bandook or duusare barbar tareekon ne bhi rajya ke logon main bahut gussa bhar diya he
 "despite heavy losses to terrorist organizations in frequent encounters, the increasing trend of local youth towards terrorism has also raised the concern of the security forces
" pichley maheene ek apratyaashit bayaan main sena pramukh general bipin ravat ne mana, ''vah samay dur nahin he jab ve (kashmiri yuva) yah samaj jaaenge ki is tarah na to suraksha bal or na hi aatankwaadi kisi anjaam tak pahunch sakenge
 "general Rawat said that peace is the only means which can change the situation in Kashmir
" vastav main abhi mukhyadhara kii raajnneeti bhi gambhir khataron kaa saamana kar rahi he
 In April, a PDP activist Ghulam Nabi Patil was shot dead in Pulwama
 isse rajnatik kaaryakartaaon ke bich khauf ke daur kii phir se aahat milane lagi he
 Anantnag's Lok Sabha seat has been vacant since Mehbooba Mufti became the Chief Minister in 2016 as no political party is willing to take the risk of launching an election campaign in this parliamentary constituency in southern Kashmir

 He said, '(when Rahul takes over responsibility) then there will be no bad behavior here
 mujhe nahin lagata ki rahul gandhi varisht netaaon ke saath usee tarah kaa vyavhaar karenge, jaisaa modi ne varisht netaaon ke saath kiya
 Modi has sent everyone like Advani, Murali Manohar Joshi, Yashwant Sinha, Jaswant Singh to Siberia
 ' Earlier this year, the former environment minister had hoped that Rahul would take over the role of chairman in 2015, but now he says that it is taking time, as the party vice-president is engaged in choosing his team and preparing the party structure under him
 Huh
 ramesh ne kaha ki jab rahul gandhi satta sambhalate hai to yah kisi ek vyakti kaa kaman sanbhaalanaa nahin hoga balki puri team vahaan hogi
 He said, 'so he (rahul) is giving more time to choose the structure and people
 logon ke bina koi bhi dhaancha nirthak he or bina dhaanche ke log bhi upyogi nahin hote hai

 Ramesh said that when Rahul Gandhi takes over power, it will not be the command of any one person but the entire team will be there
 unhone kaha, 'isliye vah (rahul) dhaanche tathaa logon kaa chayan karne main adhik samay de rahe hai
 Without people, any structure is useless and people without infrastructure are also not useful

 Nearly five and a half lakh voters did not consider any of the BJP or Congress to be eligible to vote

 Political parties should think about these voters going to NOTA account, they may not have liked the candidate, may not have liked the speech, the way of politics

 After 22 years, BJP is forming the government again
 jeet bhale saamaanya antaron se ho magar yah jeet aitihaasik bhi he
 It is not easy to form a government for the sixth consecutive time
 kyon bani, kaise bani yah sab vishleshan ke vishay he
 The results should also be looked at overall once a day
 charchaaen bahut ho chuki hai
 It will continue to happen
 - gujarat ne bijepi ko sarkaar diya he to khud ko ek vipaksh bhi diya he
 Gujarat has not stopped Modi but has slowed down the speed of his chariot
 - gujarat ne rahul ke rath ko manzil nahin di magar uski raftaar ko tej kar diya he
 - Gujarat has also elected new young leaders like Jignesh Mevani and Alpesh Thakor
 gujarat ne satta paksh or vipaksh ke bich jo sundar santulan banaaya he vah bahut kamaal kaa he
 This is a result that will not burn anyone's heart
 bhale kisi ke saare sapane puure na hue hon
 He gave a message to the BJP that you should fix yourself and gave a message to the Congress that you should try a little more
 rahul gandhi is chunaav se netaa banakar ubhare hai to narendra modi is chunaav se aparaajey banakar nikle hai ki wo aakiri gend par chakka maar kar match jita sakate hai
 The memorable moment of the result of 18 December was between 9 am to 10 am when the Congress and BJP suddenly started backing each other in the trends
 hamane apane kaarykram kii shuruyaat ek aise graphics se kii thi jo bataa rahaa tha ki bijepi ke sarkaar banane ke 90 fisadi chance hai or congress ke 10, rujhaanon ne us graphics ko kuch vakt ke liye badal diya or ek vakt par dikhaane laga ki congress or bijepi ke sarkaar banane ke chance 50-50 percent he
 Then it started changing the graphics that the percentage of bjp's chance of forming the government started increasing

 For both, for the BJP as well as for the Congress

 Trends had now turned to BJP
 is chunaav kaa ek bada mudda tha jiesti or uskaa garh tha surat jahaan ke textile vyapaariyon ne maheenon andolan chalaaya
 There was also a crowd in his movement, this would have led the Congress to hope that the BJP could lose here due to the growing Patel's fascination for GST and Hardik
 surat bijepi kaa garh rahaa he
 The BJP has been winning heavily in the recent elections
 rahul gandhi ne jiesti ko lekar vyapaariyon tak pahunchane ke liye gabbar singh tex kaa naaraa gadha
 Rahul Gandhi went to the textile factory, interacted with the traders, even then no one felt that the businessmen of Surat would leave the BJP
 jiesti ko lekar naaraazgi is ummid ko hawa detii rahi
 In the end, when the result came, it turned out that the traders suffered loss of millions of crores in their business but did not let the BJP suffer political losses
 yah bhi dhyaan rakhana chahie ki bijepi ne chunaav ke bich jiesti ko lekar kai sudhaar kar die the
 Our colleague Mahavir Rawat said that the slogan in Surat was that the businessman might be angry but not a traitor
 surat ke vyapaariyon ne apane hi andolanon or naaraazgi ko haraa diya or bijepi ko jita diya
 This happens very rarely, only when political allegiance to the leader and party is far above the economic losses
 aisi kismat shaayad hi kisi party ko hasil hoti he
 Surat district has 16 seats
 surat shahar main teen siten hai
 BJP has been winning in Surat
 congress ko yahaan se do siten mili hai
 In Surat, the Congress has managed to win only one seat more than the last time

 In 2017, BJP lost this seat by a margin of 13,914 votes
 2012 main mandavi main congress jiti thi 24,394 maton se
 In Mandvi in 2017, Congress won by 50,776 votes
 mandavi main congress ne apana mat dabl to kar liya magar surat main vah badi jeet hasil nahin kar pai
 Surat stopped the Congress chariot
 bijepi ko yahaan 14 siton par jeet hasil hui he
 The bjp's vote in some seats in Surat did not decrease much, its margin of victory in some seats increased compared to 2012
 chaurayasi seat par bijepi ne 67,638 vot se jeeta tha, is baar 1,10,819 vot se jeet hasil kii he
 Majura seat was won by 71,556 in 2012, this time winning by 85,827 votes
 2012 main udhana seat par bijepi 32,754 voton se jiti thi, is baar 42,528 voton se jiti he
 Surat won in the West by 69,721, this time by 77,882 votes

 The number of urban seats in Gujarat is considered to be 59
 yahaan bijepi ke paksh main 1 pratishat kaa swing ho gaya yani uskaa vot bad gaya
 BJP stopped its loss in cities
 sirf do siton kaa nuksaan hua

 eggzet pole kii bhi pole khuli he isi baar
 In any exit poll, Chanakya had the highest estimate of 135 for BJP, the lowest number of C-voters was 108, India TV gave 104-114, i
e
 any exit poll gave less than 100 seats for BJP
 Did not predict
 sarkaar banane kaa trend zarur sahi sabit hua magar number ke maamle main eggzet pole fail rahe
 At the moment when i am reading prime time BJP has got less than hundred seats
 agsit pole main congress ko 42, 47, 64, 65, 66, 68 siten di thim
 All proved to be wrong
 gujarat chunaav kii shuruyaat congress ke vikaas pagal ho gaya he se shuru hua
 Prime Minister Modi concluded this election with the slogan of development
 apane kaaryakartaaon se naaraa lagavakar
 - Gujarat has given the government to the BJP and has given itself an opposition
 - gujarat ne modi ko roka to nahin magar unke rath kii raftaar ko dhimaa kar diya he
 - Gujarat has not approved Rahul's chariot but has accelerated his pace
 - gujarat ne jignesh mewaani or alpesh thakor jaise nae yuva netaaon ko bhi chunaa he
 The beautiful balance that Gujarat has created between the ruling party and the opposition is very amazing
 yah ek aisa nateeja he jisase kisi kaa dil nahin jala hoga
 Even if no one's dreams have been fulfilled
 bijepi ko sandesh diya ki aap khud ko thik kiijie or congress ko sandesh diya ki aap thodi or koshish kiijie
 If Rahul Gandhi has emerged as a leader from this election, Narendra Modi has emerged as unbeatable from this election that he can win the match by hitting the last ball for a six
 18 disambar ke nattejey kaa yaadgaar pal rahaa subah 9 se 10 baje ke bich jab achaanak rujhaanon main congress or bijepi ek duusare aage peeche hone lage
 We started our program with a graphics that said that the BJP has 90 percent chance of forming the government and 10 of the Congress trends changed that graphics for some time and at one time it started showing that Congress and bjp's chances of forming a government are 50-50 percent
 phir ye graphics badalane laga ki bijepi ke sarkaar banane ke chance kaa pratishat badhane laga
 This moment of about an hour was very tense and thrilling
 donon ke liye, bijepi ke liye bhi or congress ke liye bhi
 The leaders and journalists of both parties got stuck
 lagane laga ki nateeja kuch bhi ho saktaa he
 But in the end all went well for the BJP
 rujhaan ab bijepi kii taraf mud chuke the
 One of the major issues of this election was GST and its stronghold Surat where textile traders for months started agitating
 unke andolan main bheed bhi hua karti thi, isse congress ko ummid hui hogi ki jiesti or hardik ke prati badhate patelon ke aakarshan ke kaaran bijepi yahaan haar sakati he
 Surat is a BJP stronghold
 haal ke kai chunaavon main bijepi jamkar jitati rahi he
 Rahul Gandhi coined the Gabbar Singh tax slogan to reach out to the traders about GST
 rahul gandhi taxtile factory main gaye, vyapaariyon se samvaad kaayam kiya tab bhi kisi ko nahin lag rahaa tha ki surat ke vyapaaree bijepi kaa saath chhod denge
 Anger over the GST continued to fuel this expectation
 ant main jab nateeja aayaa to yahi niklaa ki vyapaariyon ne apane dhandhe main lakhon karodon kaa nuksaan to saha magar bijepi ko raajnneetik nuksaan nahin hone diya
 It should also be noted that the BJP had made several reforms regarding GST between elections
 hamaare sahyogi mahavir ravat ne bataaya ki surat main naaraa chalaaya gaya ki vyapaaree naaraaz ho saktaa he magar gaddaar nahin ho saktaa he
 The traders of Surat defeated their own movements and resentment and won the BJP
 aisa bahut kam hota he, tabhi hota he jab netaa or party ke prati raajnneetik nishtha aarthik nuksaan se bahut upar ho
 Hardly any party gets such luck
 surat zile main 16 siten hai
 Surat city has three seats
 surat main bijepi jitati rahi he
 Congress has got two seats from here
 surat main congress pichhali baar se sirf ek seat zyaada hasil kar pai he
 In 2012, the BJP won the Mangrol seat by a margin of 15,714 votes
 2017 main bijepi yah seat 13,914 voton ke antar se haar gai
 In 2012, Congress won Mandvi by 24,394 votes
 2017 main mandavi main congress ne 50,776 voton se jeet hasil kii he
 In Mandvi, the Congress doubled its vote but in Surat it could not achieve a major victory
 surat ne congress ke rath ko roak diya
 BJP has won 14 seats here
 surat kii kuch siton par bijepi ke vot main bahut kami bhi nahin ai, kuch siton par uski jeet kaa antar 2012 kii tulana main bad gaya
 The BJP won the Chowrayasi seat by 67,638 votes, this time winning by 1,10,819 votes
 2012 main majura seat par 71,556 se jeet mili thi, is baar 85,827 voton se jeet hui he
 In 2012, BJP won Udhna seat by 32,754 votes, this time won by 42,528 votes
 surat pashchim main 69,721 se jiti thi, is baar 77,882 voton se jiti he
 bjp's votes in Surat East and Surat North fell but it won
 surat main jiesti kaa mudda nahin chalaa
 Surat district stood as a rock with the BJP
 gujarat main shahari siton kii sankhya 59 maani jaati he
 Here there was a swing of 1 percent in favor of BJP, which means its vote increased
 bijepi ne shaharon main apana nuksaan roak liya
 Only two seats were lost
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne is jeet par raahat kii saans lee or himachal pradesh or gujarat kii jeet kaa jashn manaane party mukhyalay aae
 Unaware that the difference in seats has been reduced, in fact these subjects are of analysts, for the politician there is only victory and victory was already done
 kya congress ne jiesti ke masale ko galat samajha
 Rahul Gandhi kept saying repeatedly that he had fixed the issues by talking to the people of Gujarat
 jiesti ke masale par takalif ke baad bhi surat ne jis tarah se bijepi kaa saath diya he vah abhootpurv he
 The Congress performed well only in Saurashtra
 saurashtra ilaake main 56 siten hai, yahaan congress ko 32 siten mili hai or bijepi ko 23 mili hai
 In Saurashtra, BJP has gained 15 seats and BJP has lost 13 seats
 congress saurashtra kii badhat baaki kshetron main nahin bana saki
 Its three prominent faces Shakti Singh Gohil, Arjun Modwadia and Siddharth Patel lost the election
 bijepi sarkaar banane kii trophy lekar ja chuki he
 The Congress may be satisfied with the fact that the BJP lost the Unjha Assembly in Vadnagar, the birthplace of the Prime Minister
 1995 ke baad pehali baar yahaan se haari he
 1995 - 121 1998 - 117 2002 - 127 2007 - 117 2012 - 115 2017 main 99 The BJP has won Gujarat from 1995 to five elections and won more than 100 seats each time
 2017 main pehali baar 100 se kam siten ai hai
 The Prime Minister in his speech mentioned 121 of 1995 but only mentioned the rest, did not mention the number of seats
 iske baad bhi pradhanmantri ne gujarat bijepi ke kaaryakarta, netaa sabko badhai bhi di
 Congratulations also to the people of Gujarat
 2017 main bijepi ko 49
 Got 1 percent vote
 siten kam hui hai magar bijepi ne mat pratishat main vruddhi kii he
 The vote percentage of Congress has also increased and seats have increased
 congress ne 1990 ke baad pehali baar itnaa acha pradarshan kiya tha
 The Congress won 33 seats in 1990, with only 45 to 61 seats in the subsequent four elections
 2017 main pehali baar congress ko 80 siten mili hai
 There was also an opportunity for Congress President Rahul Gandhi to give a counter-speech but he only tweeted
 pradhanmantri modi jeet ke baad apane kaaryakartaaon ke bich aakar sambodhit kar rahe the, pradarshan rahul kii party kaa bhi kharaab nahin tha, vah bhi is maukey par apane kaaryakartaaon kaa hausala badha sakate the
 The Prime Minister again said that not a single Gujarati can be separated from them
 unhone aahwan kiya ki phir se miljul kar kaam karte hai
 The Prime Minister also praised Amit Shah fiercely
 bijepi nateeja aane ke baad congress par jatvaad failaane kaa aarope lagaati rahi magar aap tikaton kaa bantwaaraa dekhen to donon dalon ne jati ke hisaab se tikat die
 The Patel movement once felt that the bjp's base was slipping
 patel bahul kshetra main congress ko laabh to hua magar bijepi ne bhi acha kiya he
 Hardik Patel may be talking about tampering with the EVM machine, but the results are showing that Patel did not support Hardik
 visanagar jahaan se patel andolan shuru hua tha vahaan se bijepi jiti he
 The Ghatoldia seat belonged to Anandiben Patel, she did not contest the election but the BJP also won her seat with a huge vote
 ghatoldia se bijepi ke bhupedarbhai patel ne congress ke shashikant patel ko 1,17,750 voton se haraaya
 Hitesh Patel defeated Chogarasi by Yogesh Patel of Congress by 1,10819 votes
 maninagar se bijepi ke suresh patel ne congress ke brahmabhatt shwetaben narendra bhai ko 75,199 vot se haraaya
 The Election Commission has said that three crore voters have voted with VVPAT
 sabane dekha tha ki unka vot kise padaa he to iviem se chhedchhad kaise ho sakati he
 The Gujarat election has not disappointed anyone
 bijepi ko satta di he to congress ke rup main vipaksh
 Not only this, Jignesh Mevani and Alpesh Thakor have also been sent to the assembly
 jignesh nirdaleey ummdeevaar ke rup main chunaav lard rahe hai
 Jignesh has contested and won with donations from the people
 banaaskantha ke vadagaam seat se jignesh ne bijepi ke vijayakumar ko kareeb 20,000 voton se haraa diya
 Alpesh Thakor from Radhanpur defeated bjp's Loving Ji Thakore by 15000 votes
 congress ke kai bade netaa haare hai to bijepi ke netaaon main shankar choudhary, dilip sanghni, atmaram parmaar, chiman bhai saapriya or jainarayan vyas haar gaye hai
 There were many such seats in this election where the margin of victory was defeated by very few votes
 22 siton par 3000 se kam par faisla hua he
 Although it happens in every election, today is the day of the winners, the more mentioned, the better it will be
 godhra se bijepi ke si ke roulji ne congress ke rajendra singh parmaar ko 258 voton se haraaya
 From Modasa, Rajendra Singh Thakor of Congress defeated Bhikusinhji Parmar of BJP by 147 votes
 kaparda se congress ke jitubhai choudhary ne bijepi ke ummidavaar ko 170 vot se haraaya
 Bhupendra Singh Chudasama of BJP from Dholka defeated Ashwin Bhai Rathore of Congress by 327 votes
 mansa main congress ke suresh patel ne bijepi ke amit bhai choudhary ko 524 voto se haraaya
 The comments gujarat main is baar mahila vidhayakon kii sankhya 11 hogi
 Harsh Shyam ji of BJP will be the youngest MLA
 kai baar lagata he ki pradhanmantri ke aakraamak campan se nateezon par fark padaa
 Exit poll is also open this time
 kisi bhi eggzet pole main bijepi ke liye sabase adhik today chanakya ne 135 kaa anumaan bataaya tha, sabase kam si-voter ne 108, india tivi ne 104-114 diya tha, yani kisi bhi eggzet pole ne bijepi ke liye 100 se kam seat kaa anumaan nahin bataaya tha
 The trend of government formation proved to be true, but the exit poll failed in terms of numbers
 is vakt jab main prime time pard rahaa hum bijepi ko sau se kam siten ain hai
 In the exit poll, Congress was given 42, 47, 64, 65, 66, 68 seats
 sab galat sabit hue
 The beginning of the Gujarat elections began with the development of the Congress gone mad
 pradhanmantri modi ne is chunaav kaa samaapan vikaas ke naare se kiya
 By getting slogans from his workers
 gujarat ne satta paksh or vipaksh ke bich jo sundar santulan banaaya he vah bahut kamaal kaa he
 This is a result that will not burn anyone's heart
 bhale kisi ke saare sapane puure na hue hon
 He gave a message to the BJP that you should fix yourself and gave a message to the Congress that you should try a little more
 rahul gandhi is chunaav se netaa banakar ubhare hai to narendra modi is chunaav se aparaajey banakar nikle hai ki wo aakiri gend par chakka maar kar match jita sakate hai
 The memorable moment of the result of 18 December was between 9 am to 10 am when the Congress and BJP suddenly started backing each other in the trends
 hamane apane kaarykram kii shuruyaat ek aise graphics se kii thi jo bataa rahaa tha ki bijepi ke sarkaar banane ke 90 fisadi chance hai or congress ke 10, rujhaanon ne us graphics ko kuch vakt ke liye badal diya or ek vakt par dikhaane laga ki congress or bijepi ke sarkaar banane ke chance 50-50 percent he
 Then it started changing the graphics that the percentage of bjp's chance of forming the government started increasing
 kareeb ek ghante kaa yah lamhaa behad tanaav or romaanch bharaa tha
 For both, for the BJP as well as for the Congress
 donon dalon ke netaaon or patrakaron kii saanse atak gayi
 It seemed that the result could be anything
 magar ant main bijepi ke liye sab acha hua
 Trends had now turned to BJP
 is chunaav kaa ek bada mudda tha jiesti or uskaa garh tha surat jahaan ke textile vyapaariyon ne maheenon andolan chalaaya
 There was also a crowd in his movement, this would have led the Congress to hope that the BJP could lose here due to the growing Patel's fascination for GST and Hardik
 surat bijepi kaa garh rahaa he
 The BJP has been winning heavily in the recent elections
 rahul gandhi ne jiesti ko lekar vyapaariyon tak pahunchane ke liye gabbar singh tex kaa naaraa gadha
 Rahul Gandhi went to the textile factory, interacted with the traders, even then no one felt that the businessmen of Surat would leave the BJP
 jiesti ko lekar naaraazgi is ummid ko hawa detii rahi
 In the end, when the result came, it turned out that the traders suffered loss of millions of crores in their business but did not let the BJP suffer political losses
 yah bhi dhyaan rakhana chahie ki bijepi ne chunaav ke bich jiesti ko lekar kai sudhaar kar die the
 Our colleague Mahavir Rawat said that the slogan in Surat was that the businessman might be angry but not a traitor
 surat ke vyapaariyon ne apane hi andolanon or naaraazgi ko haraa diya or bijepi ko jita diya
 This happens very rarely, only when political allegiance to the leader and party is far above the economic losses
 aisi kismat shaayad hi kisi party ko hasil hoti he
 Surat district has 16 seats
 surat shahar main teen siten hai
 BJP has been winning in Surat
 congress ko yahaan se do siten mili hai
 In Surat, the Congress has managed to win only one seat more than the last time
 2012 main bijepi ne mangrol seat 15,714 voton ke antar se jiti thi
 In 2017, BJP lost this seat by a margin of 13,914 votes
 2012 main mandavi main congress jiti thi 24,394 maton se
 In Mandvi in 2017, Congress won by 50,776 votes
 mandavi main congress ne apana mat dabl to kar liya magar surat main vah badi jeet hasil nahin kar pai
 Surat stopped the Congress chariot
 bijepi ko yahaan 14 siton par jeet hasil hui he
 The bjp's vote in some seats in Surat did not decrease much, its margin of victory in some seats increased compared to 2012
 chaurayasi seat par bijepi ne 67,638 vot se jeeta tha, is baar 1,10,819 vot se jeet hasil kii he
 Majura seat was won by 71,556 in 2012, this time winning by 85,827 votes
 2012 main udhana seat par bijepi 32,754 voton se jiti thi, is baar 42,528 voton se jiti he
 Surat won in the West by 69,721, this time by 77,882 votes
 surat purv or surat uttar main bijepi ke vot kam hue magar jeet use hi mili
 The issue of GST did not work in Surat
 surat zila bijepi ke saath chattan kii tarah khadaa rahaa
 The number of urban seats in Gujarat is considered to be 59
 yahaan bijepi ke paksh main 1 pratishat kaa swing ho gaya yani uskaa vot bad gaya
 BJP stopped its loss in cities
 sirf do siton kaa nuksaan hua
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi breathed a sigh of relief on this victory and came to the party headquarters to celebrate the victories of Himachal Pradesh and Gujarat
 is baat se bephikr ki siton kaa antar kam hua he, darasal ye vishay vishleshkon ke hote hai, rajaneta ke liye sirf jeet hoti he or jeet ho chuki thi
 Did Congress misunderstand the GST issue? rahul gandhi baar-baar kehete rahe ki unhone gujarat ke logon se baat kar mudde tay kiye hai
 The way Surat has supported the BJP, even after the issue of GST, is unprecedented
 congress ne sirf saurashtra main acha pradarshan kiya
 There are 56 seats in Saurashtra region, Congress has got 32 seats and BJP has got 23 seats
 saurashtra main bijepi ko 15 seat kaa phayda hua he or bijepi ko 13 seat kaa nuksaan hua he
 Congress could not make Saurashtra's lead in other areas
 uske teenon pramukh chehre shakti singh gohil, arjuna modwadiya or siddharth patel chunaav haar gaye
 BJP has taken the trophy to form the government

 pradhanmantri ne phir se kaha ki ek bhi gujarati unase alag nahin ho saktaa he
 He called that they work together again
 pradhanmantri ne amit shah kii bhi jamkar tarif kii
 After the result of the BJP, the Congress continued to accuse the Congress of spreading casteism, but if you see the distribution of tickets, then both parties gave tickets according to caste
 patel andolan ke kaaran ek baar laga ki bijepi kaa aadhaar khisak rahaa he
 In the Patel-dominated region, the Congress benefited but the BJP has also done well

 The memorable moment of the result of 18 December was between 9 am to 10 am when the Congress and BJP suddenly started backing each other in the trends
 hamane apane kaarykram kii shuruyaat ek aise graphics se kii thi jo bataa rahaa tha ki bijepi ke sarkaar banane ke 90 fisadi chance hai or congress ke 10, rujhaanon ne us graphics ko kuch vakt ke liye badal diya or ek vakt par dikhaane laga ki congress or bijepi ke sarkaar banane ke chance 50-50 percent he
 Then it started changing the graphics that the percentage of bjp's chance of forming the government started increasing
 kareeb ek ghante kaa yah lamhaa behad tanaav or romaanch bharaa tha
 For both, for the BJP as well as for the Congress
 donon dalon ke netaaon or patrakaron kii saanse atak gayi
 It seemed that the result could be anything
 magar ant main bijepi ke liye sab acha hua
 Trends had now turned to BJP
 is chunaav kaa ek bada mudda tha jiesti or uskaa garh tha surat jahaan ke textile vyapaariyon ne maheenon andolan chalaaya
 There was also a crowd in his movement, this would have led the Congress to hope that the BJP could lose here due to the growing Patel's fascination for GST and Hardik
 surat bijepi kaa garh rahaa he
 The BJP has been winning heavily in the recent elections
 rahul gandhi ne jiesti ko lekar vyapaariyon tak pahunchane ke liye gabbar singh tex kaa naaraa gadha
 Rahul Gandhi went to the textile factory, interacted with the traders, even then no one felt that the businessmen of Surat would leave the BJP
 jiesti ko lekar naaraazgi is ummid ko hawa detii rahi
 In the end, when the result came, it turned out that the traders suffered loss of millions of crores in their business but did not let the BJP suffer political losses
 yah bhi dhyaan rakhana chahie ki bijepi ne chunaav ke bich jiesti ko lekar kai sudhaar kar die the
 Our colleague Mahavir Rawat said that the slogan in Surat was that the businessman might be angry but not a traitor
 surat ke vyapaariyon ne apane hi andolanon or naaraazgi ko haraa diya or bijepi ko jita diya
 This happens very rarely, only when political allegiance to the leader and party is far above the economic losses
 aisi kismat shaayad hi kisi party ko hasil hoti he
 Surat district has 16 seats
 surat shahar main teen siten hai
 BJP has been winning in Surat
 congress ko yahaan se do siten mili hai
 In Surat, the Congress has managed to win only one seat more than the last time

 2012 main mandavi main congress jiti thi 24,394 maton se
 In Mandvi in 2017, Congress won by 50,776 votes
 mandavi main congress ne apana mat dabl to kar liya magar surat main vah badi jeet hasil nahin kar pai
 Surat stopped the Congress chariot
 bijepi ko yahaan 14 siton par jeet hasil hui he
 The bjp's vote in some seats in Surat did not decrease much, its margin of victory in some seats increased compared to 2012
 chaurayasi seat par bijepi ne 67,638 vot se jeeta tha, is baar 1,10,819 vot se jeet hasil kii he
 Majura seat was won by 71,556 in 2012, this time winning by 85,827 votes

 surat purv or surat uttar main bijepi ke vot kam hue magar jeet use hi mili
 The issue of GST did not work in Surat
 surat zila bijepi ke saath chattan kii tarah khadaa rahaa
 The number of urban seats in Gujarat is considered to be 59
 yahaan bijepi ke paksh main 1 pratishat kaa swing ho gaya yani uskaa vot bad gaya
 BJP stopped its loss in cities
 sirf do siton kaa nuksaan hua
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi breathed a sigh of relief on this victory and came to the party headquarters to celebrate the victories of Himachal Pradesh and Gujarat
 is baat se bephikr ki siton kaa antar kam hua he, darasal ye vishay vishleshkon ke hote hai, rajaneta ke liye sirf jeet hoti he or jeet ho chuki thi
 Did Congress misunderstand the GST issue? rahul gandhi baar-baar kehete rahe ki unhone gujarat ke logon se baat kar mudde tay kiye hai
 The way Surat has supported the BJP, even after the issue of GST, is unprecedented
 congress ne sirf saurashtra main acha pradarshan kiya
 There are 56 seats in Saurashtra region, Congress has got 32 seats and BJP has got 23 seats
 saurashtra main bijepi ko 15 seat kaa phayda hua he or bijepi ko 13 seat kaa nuksaan hua he
 Congress could not make Saurashtra's lead in other areas
 uske teenon pramukh chehre shakti singh gohil, arjuna modwadiya or siddharth patel chunaav haar gaye
 BJP has taken the trophy to form the government
 congress chaahe to is baat se santosh kar sakati he ki pradhanmantri ke janmasthan vadnagar jis vidhansabha kshetra main he, oonja vidhansabha se bijepi haar gai he
 Have lost here for the first time since 1995

 2017 saw less than 100 seats for the first time
 pradhanmantri ne apane bhaashan main 1995 ke 121 kaa to zikr to kiya magar baaki kaa sirf zikr kiya, siton kii sankhya kaa zikr nahin kiya
 Even after this, the Prime Minister also congratulated the Gujarat BJP worker and leader
 gujarat kii janata ko bhi badhai
 49 to BJP in 2017
 1 pratishat mat mila he
 The seats have decreased but BJP has increased the vote percentage
 vot pratishat congress kaa bhi badha he or siten badi hai

 For the first time in 2017, Congress has got 80 seats
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ke liye bhi mauka tha ki ve javaabi bhaashan dete magar unhone sirf twit kiya
 Prime Minister Modi was addressing after his victory among his workers, the performance of Rahul's party was also not bad, he could also encourage his workers on this occasion
 pradhanmantri ne phir se kaha ki ek bhi gujarati unase alag nahin ho saktaa he
 He called that they work together again
 pradhanmantri ne amit shah kii bhi jamkar tarif kii
 After the result of the BJP, the Congress continued to accuse the Congress of spreading casteism, but if you see the distribution of tickets, then both parties gave tickets according to caste
 patel andolan ke kaaran ek baar laga ki bijepi kaa aadhaar khisak rahaa he
 In the Patel-dominated region, the Congress benefited but the BJP has also done well
 hardik patel bhale iviem mashin se chhedchhad hone kii baat kar rahe hai magar nattejey bataa rahe hai ki patelon ne hardik kaa saath nahin diya
 BJP has won from Visnagar where the Patel movement started
 ghatoldia seat anandiben patel kii thi, unhone chunaav nahin ladaa magar unki seat par bhi bijepi baari maton se jiti he

 Everyone had seen who got their votes, so how can EVM be tampered with
 gujarat chunaav ne kisi ko niraash nahin kiya he
 If the BJP is given power then the opposition in the form of Congress
 yahi nahin jignesh mewaani or alpesh thakor ko bhi vidhansabha bhej diya he
 Jignesh is contesting as an independent candidate
 jignesh ne logon se chanda lekar chunaav ladaa or jeet hasil kii he
 Jignesh defeated Vijaykumar of BJP by nearly 20,000 votes from Vadgam seat of Banaskantha
 radhanpur se alpesh thakor ne bijepi ke luving ji thakor ko 15000 voton se haraaya he
 While many big leaders of the Congress have lost, BJP leaders Shankar Chaudhary, Dilip Sanghani, Atmaram Parmar, Chiman Bhai Saparia and Jayanarayan Vyas have lost
 is chunaav main kai aisi siten thim, jahaan haar jeet kaa faasla bahut kam voton se hua
 22 seats have been decided on less than 3000
 vaise har chunaav main hota he phir bhi aaj jeetne waalon kaa din he, jitne kaa zikr ho jaae, utana hi acha rahegaa

 tippaniyan This time the number of women legislators in Gujarat will be 11
 bijepi ke harsh shyaam ji sabase kam umr ke vidhayak honge
 At times, it seems that the Prime Minister's aggressive campaign has influenced the results
 eggzet pole kii bhi pole khuli he isi baar
 In any exit poll, Chanakya had the highest estimate of 135 for BJP, the lowest number of C-voters was 108, India TV gave 104-114, i
e
 any exit poll gave less than 100 seats for BJP
 Did not predict
 sarkaar banane kaa trend zarur sahi sabit hua magar number ke maamle main eggzet pole fail rahe
 At the moment when i am reading prime time BJP has got less than hundred seats
 agsit pole main congress ko 42, 47, 64, 65, 66, 68 siten di thim
 All proved to be wrong
 gujarat chunaav kii shuruyaat congress ke vikaas pagal ho gaya he se shuru hua
 Prime Minister Modi concluded this election with the slogan of development
 apane kaaryakartaaon se naaraa lagavakar
 One of the major issues of this election was GST and its stronghold Surat where textile traders for months started agitating
 unke andolan main bheed bhi hua karti thi, isse congress ko ummid hui hogi ki jiesti or hardik ke prati badhate patelon ke aakarshan ke kaaran bijepi yahaan haar sakati he
 Surat is a BJP stronghold
 haal ke kai chunaavon main bijepi jamkar jitati rahi he
 Rahul Gandhi coined the Gabbar Singh tax slogan to reach out to the traders about GST
 rahul gandhi taxtile factory main gaye, vyapaariyon se samvaad kaayam kiya tab bhi kisi ko nahin lag rahaa tha ki surat ke vyapaaree bijepi kaa saath chhod denge
 Anger over the GST continued to fuel this expectation
 ant main jab nateeja aayaa to yahi niklaa ki vyapaariyon ne apane dhandhe main lakhon karodon kaa nuksaan to saha magar bijepi ko raajnneetik nuksaan nahin hone diya
 It should also be noted that the BJP had made several reforms regarding GST between elections
 hamaare sahyogi mahavir ravat ne bataaya ki surat main naaraa chalaaya gaya ki vyapaaree naaraaz ho saktaa he magar gaddaar nahin ho saktaa he
 The traders of Surat defeated their own movements and resentment and won the BJP
 aisa bahut kam hota he, tabhi hota he jab netaa or party ke prati raajnneetik nishtha aarthik nuksaan se bahut upar ho
 Hardly any party gets such luck
 surat zile main 16 siten hai
 Surat city has three seats
 surat main bijepi jitati rahi he
 Congress has got two seats from here
 surat main congress pichhali baar se sirf ek seat zyaada hasil kar pai he
 In 2012, the BJP won the Mangrol seat by a margin of 15,714 votes
 2017 main bijepi yah seat 13,914 voton ke antar se haar gai
 In 2012, Congress won Mandvi by 24,394 votes
 2017 main mandavi main congress ne 50,776 voton se jeet hasil kii he
 In Mandvi, the Congress doubled its vote but in Surat it could not achieve a major victory
 surat ne congress ke rath ko roak diya
 BJP has won 14 seats here
 surat kii kuch siton par bijepi ke vot main bahut kami bhi nahin ai, kuch siton par uski jeet kaa antar 2012 kii tulana main bad gaya
 The BJP won the Chowrayasi seat by 67,638 votes, this time winning by 1,10,819 votes
 2012 main majura seat par 71,556 se jeet mili thi, is baar 85,827 voton se jeet hui he
 In 2012, BJP won Udhna seat by 32,754 votes, this time won by 42,528 votes
 surat pashchim main 69,721 se jiti thi, is baar 77,882 voton se jiti he
 bjp's votes in Surat East and Surat North fell but it won
 surat main jiesti kaa mudda nahin chalaa
 Surat district stood as a rock with the BJP
 gujarat main shahari siton kii sankhya 59 maani jaati he
 Here there was a swing of 1 percent in favor of BJP, which means its vote increased
 bijepi ne shaharon main apana nuksaan roak liya
 Only two seats were lost
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne is jeet par raahat kii saans lee or himachal pradesh or gujarat kii jeet kaa jashn manaane party mukhyalay aae
 Unaware that the difference in seats has been reduced, in fact these subjects are of analysts, for the politician there is only victory and victory was already done
 kya congress ne jiesti ke masale ko galat samajha
 Rahul Gandhi kept saying repeatedly that he had fixed the issues by talking to the people of Gujarat
 jiesti ke masale par takalif ke baad bhi surat ne jis tarah se bijepi kaa saath diya he vah abhootpurv he
 The Congress performed well only in Saurashtra
 saurashtra ilaake main 56 siten hai, yahaan congress ko 32 siten mili hai or bijepi ko 23 mili hai
 In Saurashtra, BJP has gained 15 seats and BJP has lost 13 seats
 congress saurashtra kii badhat baaki kshetron main nahin bana saki
 Its three prominent faces Shakti Singh Gohil, Arjun Modwadia and Siddharth Patel lost the election
 bijepi sarkaar banane kii trophy lekar ja chuki he
 The Congress may be satisfied with the fact that the BJP lost the Unjha Assembly in Vadnagar, the birthplace of the Prime Minister
 1995 ke baad pehali baar yahaan se haari he
 1995 - 121 1998 - 117 2002 - 127 2007 - 117 2012 - 115 2017 main 99 The BJP has won Gujarat from 1995 to five elections and won more than 100 seats each time
 2017 main pehali baar 100 se kam siten ai hai
 The Prime Minister in his speech mentioned 121 of 1995 but only mentioned the rest, did not mention the number of seats
 iske baad bhi pradhanmantri ne gujarat bijepi ke kaaryakarta, netaa sabko badhai bhi di
 Congratulations also to the people of Gujarat
 2017 main bijepi ko 49
 Got 1 percent vote
 siten kam hui hai magar bijepi ne mat pratishat main vruddhi kii he
 The vote percentage of Congress has also increased and seats have increased
 congress ne 1990 ke baad pehali baar itnaa acha pradarshan kiya tha
 The Congress won 33 seats in 1990, with only 45 to 61 seats in the subsequent four elections
 2017 main pehali baar congress ko 80 siten mili hai
 There was also an opportunity for Congress President Rahul Gandhi to give a counter-speech but he only tweeted
 pradhanmantri modi jeet ke baad apane kaaryakartaaon ke bich aakar sambodhit kar rahe the, pradarshan rahul kii party kaa bhi kharaab nahin tha, vah bhi is maukey par apane kaaryakartaaon kaa hausala badha sakate the
 The Prime Minister again said that not a single Gujarati can be separated from them
 unhone aahwan kiya ki phir se miljul kar kaam karte hai
 The Prime Minister also praised Amit Shah fiercely
 bijepi nateeja aane ke baad congress par jatvaad failaane kaa aarope lagaati rahi magar aap tikaton kaa bantwaaraa dekhen to donon dalon ne jati ke hisaab se tikat die
 The Patel movement once felt that the bjp's base was slipping
 patel bahul kshetra main congress ko laabh to hua magar bijepi ne bhi acha kiya he
 Hardik Patel may be talking about tampering with the EVM machine, but the results are showing that Patel did not support Hardik
 visanagar jahaan se patel andolan shuru hua tha vahaan se bijepi jiti he
 The Ghatoldia seat belonged to Anandiben Patel, she did not contest the election but the BJP also won her seat with a huge vote
 ghatoldia se bijepi ke bhupedarbhai patel ne congress ke shashikant patel ko 1,17,750 voton se haraaya
 Hitesh Patel defeated Chogarasi by Yogesh Patel of Congress by 1,10819 votes
 maninagar se bijepi ke suresh patel ne congress ke brahmabhatt shwetaben narendra bhai ko 75,199 vot se haraaya
 The Election Commission has said that three crore voters have voted with VVPAT
 sabane dekha tha ki unka vot kise padaa he to iviem se chhedchhad kaise ho sakati he
 The Gujarat election has not disappointed anyone
 bijepi ko satta di he to congress ke rup main vipaksh
 Not only this, Jignesh Mevani and Alpesh Thakor have also been sent to the assembly
 jignesh nirdaleey ummdeevaar ke rup main chunaav lard rahe hai
 Jignesh has contested and won with donations from the people
 banaaskantha ke vadagaam seat se jignesh ne bijepi ke vijayakumar ko kareeb 20,000 voton se haraa diya
 Alpesh Thakor from Radhanpur defeated bjp's Loving Ji Thakore by 15000 votes
 congress ke kai bade netaa haare hai to bijepi ke netaaon main shankar choudhary, dilip sanghni, atmaram parmaar, chiman bhai saapriya or jainarayan vyas haar gaye hai
 There were many such seats in this election where the margin of victory was defeated by very few votes
 22 siton par 3000 se kam par faisla hua he
 Although it happens in every election, today is the day of the winners, the more mentioned, the better it will be
 godhra se bijepi ke si ke roulji ne congress ke rajendra singh parmaar ko 258 voton se haraaya
 From Modasa, Rajendra Singh Thakor of Congress defeated Bhikusinhji Parmar of BJP by 147 votes
 kaparda se congress ke jitubhai choudhary ne bijepi ke ummidavaar ko 170 vot se haraaya
 Bhupendra Singh Chudasama of BJP from Dholka defeated Ashwin Bhai Rathore of Congress by 327 votes
 mansa main congress ke suresh patel ne bijepi ke amit bhai choudhary ko 524 voto se haraaya
 The comments gujarat main is baar mahila vidhayakon kii sankhya 11 hogi
 Harsh Shyam ji of BJP will be the youngest MLA
 kai baar lagata he ki pradhanmantri ke aakraamak campan se nateezon par fark padaa
 Exit poll is also open this time
 kisi bhi eggzet pole main bijepi ke liye sabase adhik today chanakya ne 135 kaa anumaan bataaya tha, sabase kam si-voter ne 108, india tivi ne 104-114 diya tha, yani kisi bhi eggzet pole ne bijepi ke liye 100 se kam seat kaa anumaan nahin bataaya tha
 The trend of government formation proved to be true, but the exit poll failed in terms of numbers
 is vakt jab main prime time pard rahaa hum bijepi ko sau se kam siten ain hai
 In the exit poll, Congress was given 42, 47, 64, 65, 66, 68 seats
 sab galat sabit hue
 The beginning of the Gujarat elections began with the development of the Congress gone mad
 pradhanmantri modi ne is chunaav kaa samaapan vikaas ke naare se kiya
 By getting slogans from his workers
 rahul gandhi ne jiesti ko lekar vyapaariyon tak pahunchane ke liye gabbar singh tex kaa naaraa gadha
 Rahul Gandhi went to the textile factory, interacted with the traders, even then no one felt that the businessmen of Surat would leave the BJP
 jiesti ko lekar naaraazgi is ummid ko hawa detii rahi
 In the end, when the result came, it turned out that the traders suffered loss of millions of crores in their business but did not let the BJP suffer political losses
 yah bhi dhyaan rakhana chahie ki bijepi ne chunaav ke bich jiesti ko lekar kai sudhaar kar die the
 Our colleague Mahavir Rawat said that the slogan in Surat was that the businessman might be angry but not a traitor
 surat ke vyapaariyon ne apane hi andolanon or naaraazgi ko haraa diya or bijepi ko jita diya
 This happens very rarely, only when political allegiance to the leader and party is far above the economic losses

 The Patel movement once felt that the bjp's base was slipping
 patel bahul kshetra main congress ko laabh to hua magar bijepi ne bhi acha kiya he

 In the exit poll, Congress was given 42, 47, 64, 65, 66, 68 seats

 2017 main pehali baar 100 se kam siten ai hai
 The Prime Minister in his speech mentioned 121 of 1995 but only mentioned the rest, did not mention the number of seats
 iske baad bhi pradhanmantri ne gujarat bijepi ke kaaryakarta, netaa sabko badhai bhi di
 Congratulations also to the people of Gujarat

 pradhanmantri modi jeet ke baad apane kaaryakartaaon ke bich aakar sambodhit kar rahe the, pradarshan rahul kii party kaa bhi kharaab nahin tha, vah bhi is maukey par apane kaaryakartaaon kaa hausala badha sakate the

 bijepi nateeja aane ke baad congress par jatvaad failaane kaa aarope lagaati rahi magar aap tikaton kaa bantwaaraa dekhen to donon dalon ne jati ke hisaab se tikat die
 The Patel movement once felt that the bjp's base was slipping
 patel bahul kshetra main congress ko laabh to hua magar bijepi ne bhi acha kiya he
 Hardik Patel may be talking about tampering with the EVM machine, but the results are showing that Patel did not support Hardik
 visanagar jahaan se patel andolan shuru hua tha vahaan se bijepi jiti he
 The Ghatoldia seat belonged to Anandiben Patel, she did not contest the election but the BJP also won her seat with a huge vote

 There were many such seats in this election where the margin of victory was defeated by very few votes

 In the exit poll, Congress was given 42, 47, 64, 65, 66, 68 seats

 bijepi adhyaksh rajnath sinhane ajtak channel ke sidhi baat kaarykram main hedlins today ke managing editor rahul kanwal se baatcheet kii
 Presenting the major parts
 •vipaksh kii netaa sushamaa swaraj kahati hai ki pakistan ne ek sir kaata he to ham 10 kaatenge
 The leader of the largest opposition party should make such statements? What Sushma Ji said should be understood by the public
 pakistan ko lekar desh kii janata main gussa he, hamaare javaanon ke saath pakistani sena ne jo harakat kii he, vah galat he
 • Senior leaders have the responsibility to show the condition and direction to the people
 aap shabdon or vaakyon par na jaaen
 What he meant was that the time has come for Pakistan to be given a befitting reply to such antics
 •do parmaanu shaktisampann deshon ke bich is tarah kii baaten jang ko badhaava detii hai
 So should India continue to tolerate Pakistan doing things like that? • The Pakistani Foreign Minister has offered talks with India but the BJP is pushing for a befitting reply
 pakistan kii videsh mantri kii peshkash par main sarkaar se yahi kahuunga ki baatcheet aarambh karne se pehle sarvadaleey baithak bulaai jaae or usamen is baat kaa faisla hona chahie
 • What should be the policy regarding Pakistan? Pakistan should say in very few words that it should accept the evil act it has done
 •gadakari ji ne kaha ki yuan janaa chahie
 He said that talk should be held at the international level
 •aapako nahin lagata ki libral vija par roak, pakistan ke logon ko waapas bhej dene se logon ke bich ke sambandh bigadenge?cricket or bollywood ke madhyam se bharat or pakistan ke bich rishte behatar nahin ho sakate
 This is not a means
 •nitin gadakari ke khilaaf tahakikat chal rahi he
 Hey, how long the investigation will last, there are many investigating agencies of the government, why did they not investigate this matter
 or agar karwaai hoti or unke khilaaf kuch mila hota to sarkaar itane samay tak chup na baithti
 • But the RSS dominates the BJP to such an extent that they will decide the direction, condition of the party
 usne na to kabhi bijepi par haaavee hone kii koshish kii, na hi karegaa
 And where there is a need, we take opinions from them
 •narendra modi chunaav samiti ke adhyaksh ban rahe hai? yah faisla thik he?modi party hi nahin, desh ke lokapriy netaa hai
 • You believe? Who will deny this truth
 or bijepi unka jaisaa upyog karnaa chaahegi, karegi
 i can not decide this
 •par is tarah ke faisle se nitish kumaar bhi to endie se hat jaaenge
 The suggestion that i have to make in this regard, i will give it only at the Central Parliamentary Forum
