 The Indian team maintained their record by defeating arch-rivals Pakistan in the World Cup-2019 Grand Prix
 team india ne vanade world cap main pakistan se kabhi na haarane kaa silsilaa jari rakhaa
 On Sunday, he beat Pakistan by 89 runs in Manchester
 337 ranon ke pahaad se lakshya ke aage pakistan kii team kuch nahin kar pai or dakworth louis target ke aage bharat ne use 89 ranon se shikast di
 With this, India achieved its biggest victory in the World Cup over Pakistan
 isse pehle team india ne 2015 main apane chir pratidwandvi ko edilade main 76 ranon se maat di thi
 This win is also special for India because the match played between India and Pakistan earlier was the final of ICC Champions Trophy-2017, in which India was defeated
 iske saath hi bharat ne do saal baad champiens trophy final kii haar kaa badla le liya
 Significantly, the wounds of that defeat were big for India, which had no other way to fill it
 bharat kabhi bhi is toornament main pakistan se haara nahin he
 India has equaled a major achievement by winning all the seven matches during the 1992 to 2019 World Cup
 darasal, world cap main kisi ek team ke khilaaf lagaataar sarvaadhik jeet kii baat karen to bharat ne pakistan ko 7-0 se maat dekar us record kii barabari kar lee he, jise khud pakistan ne srilaka ko haraakar banaaya tha

 2015: India beat Pakistan by 76 runs, 7 in Adelaide
 2019: bharat ne pakistan ko 89 ranon se maat di, manchester main Patiala House Court has given its verdict on the application of Christian Mitchell James, who acted as middleman in the agustawestland case
 court ne tihaad prashasan ko chrishchiyan mishael ko saamaanya cell main rakhane ke nirdesh die hai
 Some time ago the Tihar administration put Christian Mitchell in solitary confinement
 mishael kaa aarope tha ki wo abhi vichaaradhin kaidi he or uske maamle main court main sunwaayee chal rahi he
 Therefore, he cannot be kept in solitary prison like this
 jamaanat arji par sunwaayee ke dauraan court ne is maamle main tihaad suparitendent se jawaab maanga, jis par tihaad prashasan ne kaha ki pulavama main siarpief javaanon par hue hamale ke baad chrishchiyan mishael kii suraksha ko sunishchit karne ke liye aisa kiya gaya tha
 So that inside the jail, the life of Christian Michel, accused in the agustawestland case, does not pose any threat inside Tihar Jail
 haalanki, court ne aaj ke apane aadesh main kaha he ki mishael kii suraksha ko sunishchit karte hue usko saamaanya cell main shift kar diya jaae
 The court has asked the Tihar administration to shift Christian Mitchell to jail number one, two, three or four of them
 court ne apane aadesh main yah bhi kaha ki mishael ko jail kii guidelins ke mutabik milane vaali sabhi suvidhaayen bhi di jaae jo baaki andertrils ko di ja rahi hai
 The court said, the commercial prisoner should be kept with the rest of the prisoners
 haalanki sibiai ne sunwaayee ke dauraan mishael kii arji kaa virodh karte hue kaha ki wo jaanboojhkar aise aarope laga rahaa he jinase antarrashtriya str par tihaad jail kii image ko karaab kiya ja sake ki vahaan koi suvidha nahin he yaa fir kaidiyon kii suraksha ko dhyaan main nahin rakhaa jaataa he
 Michelle is trying to prove all this very cleverly
 kyonki usko pataa he ki agasta westland cese main sibiai kuch or logon ko pratyrpan ke jariye bharat laane kii taiyaari kar rahi he
 So the people involved in the case and there is no extradition, that's why Mitchell is making such petitions
 do anya vyakti guido hashke or carlo gerosa hai
 Earlier, Mitchell was arrested in an alleged Rs 3,600 crore scam in the purchase of an agustawestland VVIP helicopter
 mishael un teen kathith bichauliyon main se ek hai jisaki jaanch pravartan nideshaalay or kendriya jaanch agency kar rahi thi

 SK Sharma (former Secretary, Delhi Legislative Assembly) said that in case of an emergency like an earthquake or something else, then an emergency session is called to take the opposition into confidence
 iskaa naam vishesh satr rakhkar galat naam diya gaya
 The Chief Ministers before Kejriwal do not see any such absurdity about the special session
 dilli kii gaddi par 15 saal tak satta sanbhaalane vaali shila dikshit ne mahaj teen vishesh satr bulaae
 Sheila Dixit called a special session of the first Delhi assembly when the Supreme Court ruled that no non-cng vehicles would run in Delhi
 is sthiti se nipatane ke liye vipaksh ko bharose main lekar supreme court se vakt maangane kaa faisla liya gaya
 The second session of the special assembly was called on another decision of the Supreme Court, which said that Delhi's small scale industry should be immediately removed from the residential areas
 isse lakho logon kii roji roti kaa sankat paidaa ho gaya tha
 After calling a special session, a resolution seeking time from the Supreme Court was also passed
 tippaniyan The special session of the third assembly, the central government of the BJP asked the Delhi government to pass the proposal for full statehood
 us par visheshstra bulaakar prastaav paas karke bheja gaya tha
 SK Sharma, former Secretary of the Delhi Legislative Assembly, says that in 20 years, three special sessions were called under the rule of BJP and Congress
 baaki samvidhan main ullekh he ki bajet satr, monsoon satr or sheetakaaleen satr ko bulaayaa jaataa he
 Special cases should be called only when there is an emergency
 aajkal har raajnneetik party kii koshish rahati he ki sanvaidhanik parampara or sansthaaon kii is tarah se aalochana kii jaae taaki unki baat media kii surkhiyaan ban sake, lekin dilli sarkaar ko ye jarur sochna chahie ki baat baat par isi tarah vishesh satr bulaate rahane par sarkaar ke kaamkaaj par to sawaal uthegaa hi
 SK Sharma, who has been secretary in the Delhi Legislative Assembly and Parliament House for 40 years, says special sessions are only for emergency
 esake sharma (purv sachiv, dilli vidhansabha) ne kaha ki apatkaaleen sthiti main jaise koi bukamp aa gaya yaa kuch or ho gaya to koi tab vipaksh ko vishwaas main lene ke liye apatkaaleen satr bulaayaa jaataa he
 It was named incorrectly after placing a special session
 kejariwal se pehle ke mukhyamantriyon main vishesh satr ko lekar aisi koi betaabi nahin dikhti
 Sheila Dikshit, who held the throne of Delhi for 15 years, convened just three special sessions
 shila dikshit ne pehla dilli vidhansabha kaa vishesh satr tab bulaayaa jab supreme court kaa faisla aayaa ki dilli main koi bhi non CNG gaadiyaan nahin chalengi
 In order to deal with this situation, it was decided to demand time from the Supreme Court by taking the opposition into confidence
 doosraa vidhansabha kaa vishesh satr supreme court ke ek or faisle par bulaayaa gaya, jisamen kaha gaya ki dilli ke laghu udyog ko rihaayshi ilaakon se turant baahar kiya jaae
 Due to this, the crisis of livelihood of millions of people was created
 visheshstra bulaakar isamen bhi supreme court se vakt maangane kaa prastaav paas kiya gaya
 The comments teesraa vidhansabha kaa vishesh satr bijepi kii centre sarkaar ne dilli sarkaar se kaha ki purna rajya kaa darja kaa prastaav paas karke bheje
 a special session was called and a proposal was sent to him
 dilli vidhansabha ke purv sachiv esake sharma bataate hai ki 20 saal main bijepi or congress ke shashan main teen visheshstra bulaae gaye the
 The rest of the constitution mentions that the budget session, monsoon session and winter session are called
 jab apaat sthiti hoti he tabhi visheshstra bulaayaa janaa chahie
 Nowadays, every political party tries to criticize the constitutional tradition and institutions in such a way that their talk can become the headlines of the media, but the Delhi government must think that by calling a special session on this matter, the government The question will arise on the functioning

 Changing the name is not any kind of development work, but the country and the state have to bear the loss of revenue, whose burden falls on the people

 He said that it is difficult to estimate how much revenue is lost by changing a name
 naam badalanaa kisi tarah kaa vikaas kaary nahin he balki desh or pradesh ko rajasav kaa nuksaan sahanaa padataa he jiskaa boj janata par padataa he
 Prashant Bhushan
 prashanth bhushan kaa kahana he ki elahabaad kaa naam badalanaa puri tarah se galat he
 The only work of the government has been that wherever the Muslim name appears, change it and keep the Hindu name
 sarkaar har jagah nafrat failaana chaahati he or is par vah rajnatik roti senk rahe hai
 What is the problem when Allahabad is known since time immemorial
 agar kuch karnaa hi he to uttar pradesh main saikadon mudde aise hai jisase janata puri tarah se pareshaan he
 But they will not get political benefit from it, so they raise issues so that they can get political benefits
 supreme court ke adhivaktaa amitabh sinha kaa maananaa he ki punah namakaran karne kii prakriya ke udhaaharan desh hi nahin varan puure vishwa main milte hai
 These are based on popular local sentiments
 lokapriy janabhaawanaaon kaa pratinidhitiv loktantric rup se chuni hui sarkarein karti hai, iske udahaaran hai
 Trivandrum to Thiruvananthapuram, Cochin to Kochi, Madras to Chennai, Calcutta to Kolkata, Gauhati to Guwahati, Bombay to Mumbai
 bombai ko chhod sabhi congress, left or vibhin kshetreey partiyon ne punah namakaran kii prakriya puri kii
 Amitabh Sinhat amitabh sinha kehete hai ki jahaan tak elahabaad kaa vishay he, ilahabaad pracheenatam nagaron main se ek he or hazaron saal se kumbh kii vyavastha chali aa rahi he or kumbh hameshaa prayag main hota he, elahabaad main nahin
 On the basis of historical facts, Akbar, after following his family traditions, was renamed from Prayag to Allahabad
 atah prayagraj purnatah upyukt or samayik kadam he, bhartiyata ke punarjagran ke sandarbh main
 ML Sharma supreme court ke adhivaktaa emel sharma kehete hai ki raajnneeti se alag karte hue naam badalane main koi buraai nahin he, lekin agar naam badalane ke peeche rajnatik bhaavana he to isse ghinauni baat nahin ho sakati
 Sharma further says that Allahabad's first name was Allahabad, before Allahabad it was called Prayag
 ilahabaad naam aitihaasik nahin he isliye is par vivaad nahin hona chahie, lekin agar raajnneeti ke liye sirf naam parivartit kiya ja rahaa he to wo bahut buree baat he
 Prashant Bhushan says that changing the name of Allahabad is completely wrong
 sarkaar kaa ek hi kaam rah gaya he ki jahaan-jahaan muslim naam dikhaai de usko badal do or hindu naam rakh do
 The government wants to spread hatred everywhere and on this they are baking political bread
 jamaane se jab ilahabaad janaa jaataa he to aakhir pareshaani kya he
 If something has to be done, then there are hundreds of issues in Uttar Pradesh due to which the public is completely upset
 lekin unako isse rajnatik phayda nahin hoga, isliye aise mudde uthaate hai jisase unako siyaasi phayda mil sake
 Supreme Court advocate Amitabh Sinha believes that examples of renaming process are found not only in the country but in the whole world
 ye lokapriy sthaneey janabhaawanaaon par aadhaarit hote hai
 Popular public sentiments are represented by democratically elected governments, for example
 trivendram ko tiruvanantpuram, cochin ko kochi, madras ko chennai , kalakatta se kolkata, guahati ko guwahati , bombai se mumbai karnaa
 All the Congress, Left and various regional parties except Bombay completed the renaming process
 amitabh sinhatippaniyan Amitabh Sinha says that as far as the subject of Allahabad is concerned, Allahabad is one of the oldest cities and for thousands of years the Aquarius system has been in operation and the Aquarius is always in Prayag and not in Allahabad
 aitihaasik tathyon ke aadhaar par akbar ne apni paariwarik paramparaon kaa anukaran karte hue punah namakaran prayag se hataakar allahabaad kiya tha
 Prayagraj is, therefore, a perfectly appropriate and timely step in the context of the renaissance of Indianness
 emel sharma
 Supreme Court advocate ML Sharma says that there is nothing wrong in changing the name while separating it from politics, but if there is political feeling behind changing the name then it cannot be disgusting
 sharma aage kehete hai kii ilahabaad kaa pehle naam allahabaad tha allahabaad se pehle isko prayag kehete the
 The name Allahabad is not historical, so it should not be disputed, but if the name is being changed only for politics, then it is a very bad thing

 Rahul completed the first tour of Gujarat elections as per the strategy formulated by Team Rahul
 team rahul ne gujarat chunaav ke maddenjar jo line tay kii, wo kahin naa kahin ishaara karti he ki party soft hindutv kii raah par hi aage badhane vaali he
 According to the political strategy, whatever programs were made during Rahul's first visit, he revolved around Hinduism
 rahul ke daure se pehle se hi tay ho gaya ki, rahul ke daure main koi muslim netaa unke aas-paas nahin rahegaa
 During the entire tour, in-charge Ashok Gehlot, Secretary Rajiv Satav, State President Bharat Solanki and Youth Congress President Raja Brar were seen in photographs with Rahul
 dilachasp baat ye he ki, haal main ahamed patel kaa rajyasabha chunaav gujarat main sabase zyaada charchaa kaa vishay rahaa
 The victory in this election has been considered by Congress to be the morale of its workers
 iske baavjood gujarat main bamushkil rajyasabha ke jeetne vaale sonia ke raajnneetik salaahkaar ahamed patel bhi kahin bhi rahul ke aas-paas nahin dikhe
 According to sources, Team Rahul and Ahmed Patel themselves did this as a strategy
 darasal, congress ko lagata he ki, pichley vidhansabha chunaav prachaar ke aakhri charan main modi ne miyaan ahamed patel bolkar unako mukhyamantri kaa daavedaar qaraar diya or chunaav main dhruvikaran kar diya
 Now the Congress is afraid that, in the coming times, it may try to polarize once again in the election campaign by saying that the Congress will make Ahmed Patel, who comes from the backdoor Muslim community, as the Chief Minister
 isiilie congress phoonk-phoonk kar qadam uthaa rahi he
 In the coming days, Ahmed Patel himself will repeatedly say that he was neither a candidate for the post of Chief Minister, nor was he
 isiilie bhale hi upi chunaav main rahul prachaar ke dauraan mandir, maszid or gurudware gaye, lekin gujarat main yatra navaratri ke dauraan plan kii gai
 Then Rahul started the yatra by worshiping from Dwarkadhish temple, and also signed the generation debit of indira-rajiv's signature temple
 navasrujan gujarat kii yatra ke dauraan rahul tamaam mandiron main gaye
 Tripund and Tika continued to be seen on the forehead during the journey and speech
 shaam ko rahul kii durga maa kii aarti or garbe main shirkat kii tasviren-video congress soshal media or media main prachaarit karti rahi
 Speaking to Aaj Tak on this issue, RPN said that if during Navratri, Rahul worships Mother Goddess, goes to the famous Dwarkadhish temple in Gujarat, what happened, we all go
 lekin kisi maszid kyon nahin gaya iskaa congress kaa paas koi sidhaa jawaab nahin he
 Overall, the Congress feels that Bihar will vote for it in its favor, but on the lines of Bihar, the Muslims will support peacefully, without any noise and without provocation
 saath hi agar congress hinduon kaa ek tabaka bhi bijepi se tod le to wo safalataa hasil kar sakati he
 That is why Congress and Team Rahul are seen moving towards soft Hindutva in the state

 soochnaaon kaa kam pahunchnaa sirf press kii azaadi par hamalaa nahin he, wo aapaki azaadi par hamalaa he
 Are you ready to lose your freedom? If yes, when did you make this decision and on what basis? i know you are troubled by the handiwork of dock media
 aapako pataa he ki bharat kaa press is vakt kinake charnon main leta hua he
 But you must have noticed one more thing
 bharat kaa press sarender karne laga he, vah ladanaa bhul gaya he
 Apart from passing condemnation proposals in select cases, the attempt to re-establish the standards of journalism and achieve the freedom of journalism is not visible
 dare huon ke liye ek acchhee khabar ai he, austrailia se
 Well, something similar has happened in India, but not in the way the people of Australia saw when they opened the newspaper on the morning of 21 October
 The Daily Telegraph, Financial Review, The Australian, The Sydney Morning Herald and the Canberra Times, the herald sun, the age, the courier mail, the advertiser, nt news, the chronicle, australia ke zyaadaatar akhbaaron kaa pehla panna 21 oktober kii subah aise hi aayaa
 There was no news printed on the front page

 The Right to Know coalition was formed in 2007 but for the first time in its history, such a campaign has taken place on a wide scale
 is abhiyaan kaa kahana he ki ki australia kii sansad aise-aise kanoon paas kar rahi he jiske kaaran log nahin jaan paa rahe hai ki sarkaar kya-kya khel khelti he
 Newspapers say that every newspaper has competition with each other but they have taken this step to protect the right of citizens of Australia to know
 kisi bhi desh main media kaa swatantra hona bahut zaruri he
 Otherwise, those in power get mad
 videshi companiyon ke saath land deal ho rahi he, janata kii jasusi ho rahi he, lekin jab patrkaar isaki khabaren likhata he to chaape padate hai, giraftaaryaan hoti hai or mukademon main ghasitkar uske kariyar ko barbaad kar diya jaataa he
 Australian newspapers say that if there was no free press, the news of scams in the bank and rigging in the elderly care sector would never have come out
 iskaa asar bhi hua
 The Federal Police of Australia said that it would be vigilant in the matter of raids by journalists

 yah janhit main zaruri he
 In many countries of the world, governments are playing their game by connecting big news with the security of the country

 When surrounded with questions, he said that no one is above the law, from the Prime Minister to the journalist
 lekin isse is abhiyaan par koi fark nahin padaa
 Newspapers were also included with all the big news channels in Australia
 news corp australia ne bhi video banaakar bataaya he ki vah bhi is abhiyaan ke saath he
 Just keep this question in mind
 sarkaar bataa rahi he yaa bataane ke naam par chipa rahi he? dekhte chaliye ki sarkaar ne logon ko andhere main rakhane ke liye kya-kya kanoon banaae hai
 Why people who choose government, their ability to think is being curbed
 yah saare sawaal akhabaaron ne apane sampadakeey main uthaae hai or janata ko jaagruk karne kaa prayaas kiya he
 The Australian Business Review has told its readers that our government does not want you to know what it is doing
 patrakaron par bain lagaaya ja rahaa he
 Let me make one thing clear
 sunakar aapako lagata hoga ki bharat kii baat bataa rahaa hum lekin darasal ye australia kii baat he
 There is a similarity to the talk of India, but in India, newspapers or channels have not taken any step as united as Australia
 australian bijness rivyuu ne likhaa he ki you have a right to be -suspicious and concerned
 That is, it is your right to doubt and worry

 abhi tak yah ladaai patrakaron kii hoti thi
 The owner escapes

 But newspapers and channels have taken up the responsibility of fighting in Australia
 aakhir patrakarita kaa sawaal akele patrkaar kaa nahin hota, santhaan or uske pathakon kaa bhi hota he
 Isn't it a joke that 66 cases were filed against a whistle blower Richard Boyle in Australia

 channelon or akhabaaron ke maalik chup ho jate hai or ek ishaare main ankar yaa reporter ko nikaal dete hai
 Whose gesture does not need to be told again and again
 akhabaaron ne likhaa he ki netaaon ke daavon ke bahekaave main mat aaie ki media apane hit main yah abhiyaan chalaa rahaa he, yah sach nahin he
 This campaign is about the right of readers and viewers to know you
 yah abhiyaan bataa rahaa he ki jab patrkaar soochna ke adhikaar ke tahat jaankaree maangate hai to usamen deree kii jaati he
 The law there is named Freedom of Information Act
 soochna dene main itani deree kii jaati he ki chunaav nikal jaataa he, janata ko pataa nahin chalata or phir us soochna kaa mahatv nahin rah jaataa
 Even when the information is given, it is half-incomplete, which means it is difficult to find out

 'there are some areas, some classified ares, where they should not have access, they should not have let people know, national security, defense, international relations, law enforcement, public saftey, these are the areas the government is saying should not be accessed by anyone including journalist, interstingly when we talk about freedome of information act, then the cabinet documents are also exempts from freedom of informations, so there is what is happening, many of those documents are leaked out, there are some whistle blowers and these are affecting the media and the same time affceting the government but the people in australia in genral more than 87 of the people think that they have the right to know what is happening, and now only 37 percent think that it is happening
 there is a problem here, there is a real issue here, that needs to be sorted out, when we talk abt public ofcourse, in terms of freedom of info act, if we look at that particular act closely, these exceptions are not allowing people or the public to know a lot of things they want to know / but at the same time we do realise the govt may be concerned because it could be something that the govt would want to control
 And that control is creating a issue now, media is suggesting that govt is dealing with those issues, in a heavy handed manner, so regardles of govt and media positions, i think public in gen in austraila they are becoming concerned what is happenig and why is this hide and seek game happening in austraila, whether people are safe, or they are facing some trouble or they are expecting something ominous in the future, peole are worried because they dont know what is the real agenda of the govt and what sort of information restrictions they want to actually put on the media, and why they are scared and afred of letting the people know
 'news corp australia ke kaaryakari adhyaksh maaikel miller ne bhi apane sampadakeey main is abhiyaan ke bare main likhaa he ki neuyork times ne thik kaha he ki australia duniya kaa sabase rahasyamayi loktantr he

 The name of the campaign was that journalists are not enemies
 us din 300 se adhik akhabaaron ne sampadakeey chapa tha ki kaise press kii swatantraaa prabhavit ho rahi he
 The campaign was led by the 146-year-old newspaper The Boston Globe

 This happens very rarely when one newspaper gives place to more than 300 other newspaper editors
 saare sampadakeey alag-alag the

 It is okay to criticize if something is printed wrong

 They can cause mistakes

 But to say the truth which is not liked is fake news is dangerous for democracy
 The boston globe ne is abhiyaan main sirf bade akhabaaron ko hi nahin balki kasbon ke chote akhabaaron ko bhi shaamil kiya tha
 So that readers can be reminded of the importance of the free press of America

 Giving great relief to Home Minister p Chidambaram in the 2-G spectrum scam, the Supreme Court has left the lower court (trial court) to decide whether or not to conduct a CBI inquiry against him, and has directed the trial court that he i decide within two weeks
 iske alaava ek anya ahm faisle main court ne 2-ji se jude 122 license bhi radd kar die hai, or kaha he ki license manamaane or asanvaidhanik tareeke se aavantit kiye gaye
 The Supreme Court has also asked TRAI to give fresh recommendations for the allocation of 2-G licenses, and the spectrum allocation should be done on an auction basis within four months
 iske alaava maamle main sibiai jaanch kii nigaraanee ke liye esaiti ke gathan kii maang karne vaali prashanth bhushan kii yachika ko supreme court ne khaarij kar diya he, or sibiai se jaanch par sthiti report mukhya satarkta ayukta ko dene ke liye kaha gaya he
 The court has also fined six telecom companies
 companiyon ko yah jurmaana 4 maheene ke bheetar dena hoga
 Significantly, Janata Party leader Subrahmanyam Swamy had demanded a CBI inquiry into his role by assuming Chidambaram as equal to former Tolikom minister a Raja
 swami kaa daawa tha ki spectrum ke daam or use baantne ke bare main saare faisle raja or chidambaram ne milakar liye, or chidambaram chaahate to sarkaar ko nuksaan se bachaa sakate the
 The government also did not lay down arms on these allegations, and completely opposed Swamy's claims in the Supreme Court
 centre sarkaar ne court main kaha ki nichali adaalat maamle kii sunwaayee kar rahi he, isliye supreme court ko yah maamla nahin sunanaa chahie
 Government agencies also called Swami's claims hollow
 sibiai ne chidambaram ko clin chit dete hue kaha ki saare dastavejon ko parkhaa gaya he or chidambaram ke khilaaf kuch nahin mila he
 But despite this, Chidambaram's problems did not ease, and in October last year, a note from the Finance Ministry came out, stating that Chidambaram could have stopped the allocation of 2-G spectrum licenses if he wanted
 iske baad sarkaar baikfoot par dikhne lagi, or vipaksh sansad ke andar or baahar hangaamaa karata rahaa
 The CBI too has its own arguments regarding Chidambaram's role in the case, and the investigating agency is using the statement of the then Finance Secretary d Subbarao, in which he said that the idea of 'first come first served' was not liked by P
 Chidambaram , But the then Telecom Minister a Raja adjourned the meeting
 iske alaava e raja ke khilaaf likhaa gaya chidambaram kaa khat bhi sibiai ke paas he
 The comments jabaki janata party netaa subramanyam swami puure maamle main grahamantri pi chidambaram ko sah-aaropee banaakar sibiai se jaanch karwaanaa chaahate hai
 They allege that the investigating agencies under the Home Ministry are protecting Chidambaram
 swami chaahate hai ki varsh 2008 main jab pi chidambaram vittamantri the, us dauraan unki bhoomika kii jaanch karwaai jaae, kyonki usee dauraan 2-ji spectrum ke liye daam tay kiye gaye the
 The entry fee for the spectrum license was kept for the year 2001, while the number of people using mobiles had increased almost hundred times during this period
 swami kaa aarope he ki chidambaram ne spectrum kii nilaamee par jor nahin diya or entry fees badhaane kii bhi maang nahin kii, varanaa sarkaar ko ghaataa na hota
 Chidambaram also did not stop the alleged mastermind of the scam, a Raja, and gave Swan and Unitech the green signal to sell its share to Etisalat and Uninor, who sold it for much more than they had paid for the license

 Apart from this, Chidambaram's letter written against a Raja is also with the CBI
 tippaniyan Whereas Janata Party leader Subramanian Swamy wants to get CBI investigated by making Home Minister p Chidambaram a co-accused in the entire case
 unka aarope he ki grih mantralay ke tahat aane vaali jaanch agenciyaan chidambaram ko bachaa rahi hai
 Swamy wants his role to be investigated in 2008 when p Chidambaram was the Finance Minister, as the prices were fixed for 2-G spectrum at the same time
 spectrum license ke liye entry fees varsh 2001 vaali rakhi gai, jabaki is dauraan mobile istemaal karne vaale logon kii taadaad takreeban sau guna bad chuki thi
 Swamy alleged that Chidambaram did not insist on the auction of spectrum and did not even demand an increase in the entry fee, otherwise the government would not have incurred losses
 chidambaram ne ghotaale ke kathith mastermind e raja ko bhi nahin roka or swaan or unitech ko apana hissaa etisalaat or uninor ko bechney ke liye hari jhandi di, jinhone license hasil karne ke liye jitna paisa diya tha, usase kahin zyada main use bechaa

 # babumoshaibandookbaaz # collage a post shared by Bidita Bandookbaaz (@biditabag) on jul 11, 2017 at 4:35 am PDT kabhi dalit or musalamaanon ke bich jhadap to kabhi dalit or thakuron ke bich sangharsh, akhir saharanpur main baar-baar hinsa kyon ho rahi he? For the third time in twenty three, the administration held a meeting with all the parties to establish peace in Saharanpur, a victim of violence
 isamen dalit or thakuron ke saath-saath tamaam raajnneetik dalon ne bhi hissaa liya
 The denial shown before the police, now the administration is trying to make up for it
 saharanpur ke dm enpi singh kaa kahana he ki intelligence or police kaa aankalan yah tha ki is mahapanchayat ko roak denge or baahar se hi logon ko waapas kar denge to chote-mote pratirodh honge, lekin police par sangathit rup se koi hamalaa There was no such possibility
 saharanpur jal rahaa he to iske peeche police kii naakaami to he hi, raajnneeti bhi gahari he
 Keeping in view the civic elections, this whole issue is also about joining the Dalit vote bank and creating political bread between Dalits and Forwards
 20 april ko sadak dudhli main ambedkar juluus ke bahaane daliton or musalmaan ke bich ek khai paidaa karne kii koshish kii gai
 The aim was to play the Hindu card, so that the Dalits could be strongly linked with the BJP
 haalanki us juluus ke hissaa rahe bijepi saansad raghav lakhanpal ise sahi nahin maanate
 BJP MP from Saharanpur Raghav Lakhanpal says why such incidents happen and why they are happening
 
 
 yah ek jaanch kaa vishay he, jise dekha jayega, lekin yah ghatnaayen aapas main judi hui nahin hai
 The last two incidents are definitely linked
 ab isamen shararti tatv koun he, yah hamen dekhnaa hoga
 On May 5, the way the Dalits first tried to provoke action against the Thakurs in Shabbirpur village, the hand of the local BSP chief is said to be behind it
 police gambhirtha ko nahin samaj pai, lihaaza thakuron kii taraf se aagzani kii vaardaat ko vah roak nahin pai
 The violence of May 9 is a revenge action on the part of Dalits
 unhen uksaane ke liye baahar se log aae
 Bhima Army's hand is being told in this
 maqasad dalit or thakuron ke bich khai badhaakar bispi ke votbank ko majboot karne kii koshish he
 The BSP, however, denies the association with Bhima Army
 tippaniyan BSP leader Qazi Rashid Masood says that this quarrel has been made by BSP, this is totally wrong
 unka aarope he ki bhim sena ke logon ne ise anjaam diya tha or is sanghathan kaa bispi se koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 Saharanpur has not had a body election for 10 years
 ab ve jald hone vaale hai
 Before this, the BSP wants to bring back the Dalits who have gone to the BJP in the assembly elections
 jabaki bijepi kisi bhi qeemat par daliton ko apane se jode rakhane kii koshish main he
 Amid this tussle, there is a possibility of further violence in Saharanpur

 Saharanpur DM NP Singh says that the intelligence and police's assessment was that there will be minor resistance if we stop this mahapanchayat and return people from outside, but any organized attack on police hoga aisi koi ashanka nahin thi
 If Saharanpur is burning, then there is a failure of the police behind it, politics is also deep

 ' From street nooks to five-star hotels, tea is easily available everywhere in the country
 lekin badalte samay ke saath coffee pasand karne waalon kii bhi sankhya badi he
 This is the reason why the culture of cafes and lounges has grown rapidly in the country
 saal 2000 main khulaa barist is antarrashtriya anubhav ko sabase pehle bharat main laane kaa daawa karata he
 Puneet Gulati, Chief Executive Officer of Barista, says, "until 2000 there was no culture like coffee cafes in the country
 yah keval bade hotalon or restaraanon ke menu tak hi simit thi
 Major changes were taking place in the country, large multinational companies were looking for opportunities in the Indian market
 tab barist ne pehali baar dilli ke basant lok main pehla coffee cafe kholaa tha
 “the Barista got a big benefit of the changes in the spending habits of the people in big cities and it became famous in a short time
 khaskar yuvaaon main is tarah ke culture kaa khaas jor tha
 The management of Barista may have changed twice in the last 18 years, but due to its quality and culture, it has created a special place in the hearts of people

 Coffee costs are also higher than other coffee brands due to the high cost
 gulati yah bhi kehete hai, "coffee ko jis tarah barist bland karata he, aise koi nahin karata
 "that's why barista coffee has its own distinct taste and people like it more than other brands
" barist main niyamit jane vaale graahak coffee ke saath-saath maahaul ko bhi pasand karte hai
 The barista currently has 200 outlets across the country
 inamen se 130 outlet company ke hai, baaki frenchichi
 Apart from India, the company also has stores in Sri Lanka, Maldives, Myanmar and Nepal

 ''2014 ke baad hi barist metro shaharon se nikalakar tear-2 or tear-3 shaharon main or lounj se nikalakar coffee cafe, korporate offis tak pahunchaa

 In this, freezers, heaters, water supply displays, billing counters etc

 One owner started taking franchisees of more than one express and kiosk, and the barista quickly made its way across the country
 agle chaar maheenon main company 40 se 50 nae store kholegi, jinamein se 80 fisadi franchiji model par hi aadhaarit honge

 The barista became known not only for coffee but also for special drink quinchers
