subah das se shaam chaar baje tak court main rahete hai
 After this, go home and rest for one and a half hours
 phir agle din ke mukademon kii taiyaari main lag jate hai
 Every lawsuit has to be seen on file
 koi file 100 pej kii hoti he to koi pachaas pej kii
 Decision between this also has to be dictated
 saadhe gyaarah baje tak sone jate hai or paanch baje uth jate hai
 The judges love walking
 tahalne ke baad subah saat se saadhe aath baje tak phir cese kii taiyaari karte hai
 He leaves for court around half past nine
 kai jaj shanivaar or ravivaar ke din bhi der raat tak kaam karte hai
 In addition to filing cases, listening to the cases filed, writing judgments, they also have other administrative functions
 unki puri kshamta is baat par aanki jaati he ki kitni tezi se ve cese ko sun lete hai, samaj lete hai or faisla dete hai
 The promotion of judges of lower courts depends on how many cases have been dealt
 kya koi jaj ek din main 50 file pard saktaa he
 Judges work from seven in the morning to 11 in the night, then on the day of the holiday
 to kya yah thik he ki unki chuttee par nazar daali jaae
 Chief Justice TS Thakur said that we do not just go to Manali
 jo sanvaidhanik peeth ke jaj hote hai wo apane faisle likh rahe hote hai
 If one side is ready then the other side is not ready
 baar se poochhate hai ki kya wo taiyaar hai
 There is a three-week holiday
 is dauraan bhi kuch jaj mukademon ko sunate hai
 The question is whether the number of judges will be eliminated by the termination of leave
 40 hazaar jaj chahie
 There are close to eight thousand judges
 kya is kami ko teen yaa chaar hafte kii chuttee ghataakar puri kii ja sakati he
 Is it possible for a judge to look at the file of twenty cases in a day
 use donon pakshon ko sunakar, kanoon padhakar faisla likhnaa hota he
 Shakespeare also has to be coached in between
 ab samaj aayaa ki hamaare jaj log shakespeare ko hi kyon kot karte rahete hai
 No one else will have time to study
 america ke supreme court main 9 jaj hai
 In all, a decision has to be given in 81 cases in a year
 bharat main ek jaj ausat 2600 mukademon ko sunata he, faisla detaa he
 The Chief Justice said that when the judges come from outside, we are surprised to see
 7 april ko pradeep thakur ne 'times of india' main likhaa he ki ek adhyayan ke anusaar hai court ke jaj ke paas ek mukademe ke liye bas paanch yaa chah minute hi hote hai
 This is the first time such a study has taken place
 jo sabase vyast jaj hai yani jiske paas bahut cese hai uske paas ek cese ko sunne ke liye sirf dhai minute hai
 The one who is least busy has only 15 to 16 minutes
 paanch se chah minute main unhen faisla dena hota he
 Daksha is an institution in Bangalore, he has done this study
 misaal ke taur par kolkata hai court main har din ek jaj ke paas 163 mukademe sunwaayee ke liye aate hai
 The same time is two minutes for a case
 patna, hyderabad, jharkhand, rajasthan ke jajon ke paas har din ek cese ke liye do se teen minute miltaa he
 Is 619 judges of higher and higher offices sufficient for a population of one billion 25 crore
 tippaniyan Anyone would feel that someone is joking with him
 aap sochiye ki aapke saath koun mazaaq kar rahaa he
 After all, why did the governments not increase the number of judges
 adaalaton main suvidhaayen kyon nahin badhaai
 Who is keeping you away from justice
 ek aadmi adaalaton main chalis chalis saal faisle ke liye intazaar karata he
 No judge has two minutes to make his decision
 uskaa intazaar faisle ke liye kam hota he
 If you get that two minutes of your judge in thirty forty years, it is for him
 kya iskaa samaadhaan mukademon kii suchi banane se nikalegaa yaa jajon kii sankhya badhaane se yah sawaal to bahut aasaan he
 Please answer yourself
 uttar pradesh kii haalat to or buree he
 People of western Uttar Pradesh have been demanding a bench for themselves since
 yahaan se lakhanu or elahabaad jate jate sabakuch bik jaataa he
 The Chief Justice also included that the facilities and structures of the courts also have to be taken care of
 meerut ke ek kisaan kii vyathaa he ki ek mukademe ne uski zindagi kis tarah se badal di
 The Allahabad High Court affair with Meerut has ruined him
 2008 main bhartiya adaalaton main 4 karod 80 lakh mukademon kii sunwaayee hui
 This figure is many times more than the court of any country in the world
 yahi kaaran he ki mukademon kii sunwaayee puri hone main kai saal lag jate hai
 Justice Balakrishnan had said that there is such a shortage of judges that a judge does not get more than 25 minutes to look at a case
 kya aapako dar nahin lagata he
 Line to the doctor
 jaj ke paas line
 Line near builder too
 vahaan bhi logon ko flats milane main chaar saal kii deree kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 25 minutes for a case
 jaj sahab computer se bhi tej kaam karte honge
 All this thoughtful 2016 came
 ravivaar kaa din tha or mauka tha anual chif ministar or chif justices conference main bharat ke maujuuda pradhan nyaayadhish vahi baat doharaate hai jo unke purv ke pradhan nyaayadhish kah gaye hai
 The Hindi translation of what he said in English is something like this - the number of judges in India needs to be increased from 7675 to 40,357
 das lakh kii aabaadi par jajon kii sankhya 10 se badhkar 50 ho
 In 1987, the Law Commission suggested 40,000 thousand judges in the country
 magar kuch nahin hua
 In 2002, the Parliamentary Standing Committee headed by Pranab Mukherjee also said that the number of judges is very less
 bharat main das lakh kii aabaadi par das hi jaj hai
 The standing committee suggested that it be increased from 10 to 50
 10 lakh par 50 jajon kii niyukti se desh main jajon kii sankhya 40,000 ho jaati he
 but nothing happened
 21 farvari 2013 ko chif justise altamas kabir ne tab ke pradhanmantri manmohan singh ko likhaa magar kuch nahin hua
 Chief Justice TS Thakur was not passionate about the shortage of judges at every level of the judiciary

 We have discussed at every stage and agreed that no case should be more than five years old in the lower courts and the High Court

 In 1986, the Supreme Court had 26 judges and the number of cases was 27,881

 The Chief Justice made good use of this opportunity so that the attention of the people goes to the shortage of judges
 unhone yah bhi bataaya ki kis tarah supreme court main jajon kii kami ke baad bhi lambit mukademon kii sankhya main kami ai he
 He said that the number of lawsuits in the courts is increasing
 aaj hai court main 38 lakh 68 hazaar mukademe lambit hai
 Vacancy of 434 judges should be filled
 chif justise ne kaha, 'wo poochhate the sawaal ki agar ek sadak 5 aadmi 10 din main banaate hai, vahi sadak agar ek din main banani ho to kitne aadmi chahie
 And the answer was, 50 people is needed

 The Chief Justice clearly stated that the solution is to increase the number of judges

 On the occasion of the 150th birth anniversary of Allahabad Court in March itself, President Pranab Mukherjee said that delay in justice is unfair
 jajon kii sankhya badhaani chahie or khaali padon ko jaldi bharna chahie
 We wanted to know how much the judges really do

 The busiest judge, that is, he who has a lot of cases, has only two and a half minutes to hear a case

 They have to give a decision in five to six minutes

 Do you sometimes feel that your boyfriend likes to talk to your friend more than you? Whenever you meet he first asks about it? These things must have troubled you somewhere or the other, but you must have bothered them by thinking that both of them are yours and your doubt is baseless

 Is he always ready to pick up that friend from somewhere or take him out somewhere? 5
 kya wo aksar aapse baat karne ke dauraan uskaa zikr ched detaa he or phir ghanton usee ke bare main baat karata rahata he?6
 Does he often ask you to invite your friend for dinner at home? Or does it happen to you that your partner asks you to invite your friend whenever you plan to go out for dinner or dinner? 7

 Does he get rid of it instantly as soon as he meets your friend? 9

 883448 ham sab jaanate hai, baba ji kaa thullu ke bare main or yah bhi jaanate hai ki is line ko mashhoor kamedian kapil sharma ne kiya he
 Now these days Sonam is saying, Babaji's Thullu, not only Sonam, but the entire team of the film 'dolly Ki Doli' is saying this, because there is a song in Sonam's film 'dolly Ki Doli', which is named Babaji Thull of sangeetkaar sajid waajid ne is gane ko banaaya he
 By the way, this song also fits the character of the film, because the film's character Dolly is a thug girl who loots the boys by pretending to be married
 yani shaadi ke baad duulhon ke paas bachataa he, baba ji kaa thullu
 When the music of the film was released in Mumbai, the entire team along with Sonam and Malaika went to dance, and here we came to know that Sonam was very excited to hear the lyrics of this song

 On the 8th of August, on the 73rd anniversary of the 'quit India' movement, the saffron brigade was stunned by the way the Dalits of Haryana launched the Quit Hinduism campaign at Jantar Mantar, a mile away from Parliament House
 desh or rajya main camel vaali sarkaar ke neeche kalma or namaaj padhakar musalmaan bane 100 se adhik pariwaron par raat main hi kuch gundon ne dharm kaa naam lekar hamalaa jarur kar diya, lekin bijepi or bhagava sanghathanon ke bade netaaon ne maukey kii najaakat dekhte hue shant rahane kii ranneeti apana rakhi he
 His silence is significant because after the formation of the Narendra Modi government at the Center, saffron organizations have started a 'ghar Wapsi' campaign across the country, which takes the initiative to convert Muslims to Hindus
 is mudde par sarkaar suniyojit rup se maun or jamini kaaryakarta mukhar rahete hai
 Presently, these newly formed Muslims are wearing a white cap of Croatia, standing at Jantar Mantar and Hindu organizations are behind the scenes trying to persuade and threaten them
 hindu sanghathanon ko ummid he ki unhen 'ghar vaapasi' ke nae sanskaran main kamyaabi mil jaaegi
 The truth is that the unheard of movement in the last three years has further infuriated the anger of the Dalits of Bhagana village in Hisar at Jantar Mantar
 poshaak badalane ke saath unhone apane naam bhi badal liye hai
 For example, Satish Kajla, who had lost his hand in the goons attack, has now become Abdul Kalam, while Deepak Kajla has now become Omar Abdullah and Ritu has now become Fatima
 mirchpur, phugana or ab bhagana ke dalit andolan kii aguai kar rahe virendra singh bagoriya ne haalanki abhi tak apana naam nahin badla he, lekin khud ko dil se musalmaan sabit karne ke liye ve kehete hai ki unhone to 21 saal pehle hi apane bete kaa naam akbar rakh diya tha
 The son is currently a btech student in Hisa 
 daliton kii shikaayat he ki 2012 main jaaton ke saath hinsak vivaad ke baad unhone gaanv chhodkar hisar dipti kamisionar ke daftar kii sidhippon par bemiyadi dharna diya, to unki maangen maanane kii bajaae unhen mini sachivalay ke baahar phenk diya gaya
 Their hearing was not heard anywhere but in 2014 four girls of the community became victims of gang rape
 isko lekar ve saal bhar se jantar mantar par dharne par baithe hai, lekin sarkaar ne ek nahin suni
 Says Bagoria, "in the Hindu system we are Dalits, therefore suffering
" dharmantaran ke jariye daliton kii pidaa desh ke saamne aegi
 "with the consent of his comrades," says Bagoria, "in Islam everyone can read Kalma together
 hindu dharm kii tarah ham yahaan neech nahin hai or na hinduon ke gulam hai
 "by the way, they defer to the question that caste system has come up in Islam in India, or else where Pasmanda Muslims would have come from
" baharhaal, daliton ke tevar talkh hai, isiilie aam taur par teji main rahane vaale hindutvvaadiyon ke tevar naram hai
 BJP MP from Gorakhpur Yogi Adityanath is in the news for his fiery statements, but he did not make any public statement on the issue
 yogi ne india today se nape-tule shabdon main kaha, ''congress kii haryana sarkaar daliton ke maamle ko teen saal tak atkaaye rahi
 We have to see the problems of Dalits sensitively and fast
 '' unhone bataaya ki is maamle ko hindu sanghathan gambhirtha se le rahe hai or unke log lagaataar anshankaree nae musalamaanon ke sampark main hai
 His 'homecoming' is being tried
 saath hi yogi ne kaha, ''lekin daliton ko apni maang uthaane ke liye dharm parivartan kaa rasta nahin apnaanaa chahie tha
 This is a kind of blackmailing
 vaise bhi dharm badalane ke baad daliton ko aarakshan kaa vah laabh nahin milegaa jo samvidhan nirmaataa baba sahab ambedkar ne unhen diya he
 "apart from this, the Mahants of Gorakshpeeth are also demanding from the government to bring strict laws against conversion
 apni maangen manwaane ke daliton ke is abhinav tareeke se, desh bhar main gum-ghumkar trishul diksha karvaa chuke vishwa hindu parishad ke antarrashtriya karyaadhyaksh praveen togdipha ko bhi samaj nahin aa rahaa ki narendra modi jaise hindutv ke poster boy ke pradhanmantri kii kursi par baithne ke baavjood sansad maarg par ho gai is ghatana par ve kis tarah pratikriya den
 Not only did he not give a public statement on the matter, he repeated the responsibility of replying to VHP joint general secretary Surendra Jain after India Today's repeated scuffles
 jain ne safai ke lahaze main kaha, ''yah sochna ki ham is mudde par khamosh hai, galat he
 i myself stayed in Hisar for four days and was involved in the mahapanchayat at Bhagana
 '' 9 agast ko hui do-dhai sau logon kii baithak ko mahapanchayat bataaya ja rahaa he
 After this meeting, it was said that if the Dalits did not return home, they would not be allowed to enter the village
 jain kehete hai, ''yah dharmantaran puri tarah gaiyr-kanoonee he
 To make their demands through blackmailing, conversion has become a fashion
 ''agar do maah pehle uttar pradesh ke rampur main hui dharmantaran kii isi tarah kii asafal koshish par najar daalen to nishchit taur par lagata he ki dharmantaran jaij yaa nazaij virodh kaa nayaa aujaar banake ubhara he
 In Rampur, Dalits had decided to convert to save government bulldozers from encroaching houses
 haalanki uttar pradesh sarkaar kaa muslim cheharaa maane jane vaale ajam khan ne apane shahar main dharmantaran nahin hone diya, balki maulavee ko hi vahaan se bhaga diya
 On the latest development, Azam told India Today, "jantar Mantar religion is not the place to change
 majahab dil main rahane vaali cheez he
 Tomorrow, someone will sit in the Rashtrapati Bhavan and say that we will capture it, otherwise if they become Muslims, will their blackmailing be accepted
 '' apni baat ko badhaate hue ajam ne kaha, ''behatar hoga ki sarkarein daliton kii samasyaon par sanjigdi se dhyaan den, samaaj main unka rutaba badhayen
 Self-styled leaders of Hinduism also understand the pain of their brothers
 ''yah dard gaharaa or bahut purana he
 On the question of 'homecoming', Bhagoria said, "plots were found to live in Hisar
 gaanv kaa chack hamen mili
 If two of the four dhams of Hindus are handed over to us, then we will consider returning home
 '' unhone bhi mana ki hindu netaa unke sampark main hai
 Also some Muslim leaders are in touch with him
 philhal jantar mantar ke baaki pradarshnkaree bhi pyaali ke tufaan ko gaur se dekh rahe hai
 Obviously, the appearance of 'homecoming' will be different this time

 Defending champions Sunrisers Hyderabad will take on Lions of Gujarat in the sixth match of IPL 10
 yah match sunrisers hyderabad ke gharelu maidan par shaam 4 baje se khelaa jayega
 Hyderabad started with a win by defeating Bangalore by 35 runs in their first match, while Suresh Ranpa's Gujarat team suffered a 10-wicket loss to Kolkata even after scoring a big score
 zaahir he gujarat kii koshish jeet hasil kar points teble main khaataa kholane kii he or iske liye team apane gendbaazon se pehle se behatar pradarshan kii ummid karegi
 Second and Hyderabad seems ready to maintain the winning momentum
 tippaniyan Skipper David Warner's poor form for Hyderabad may be a matter of concern, but despite this, the champions of last time look balanced
 pichley match main hyderabad ke liye yuvaraj singh (27 gend par 62 ran), moguej henricez (37 gend par 52 ran) or shikhar dhawan (31 gend par 40 ran) ne ran bangalore ke kilaaf batore
 In the very first match of Yuvraj, the explosive batting has made Warner happy
 unhen ummid he ki aage ke maichon main bhi chandigarh ke is khilaadi kaa balla yun hi dhamal machaata rahegaa
 Speaking of bowlers, Afghanistan's Rashid Khan (2 wickets for 36 runs), Bhuvneshwar Kumar (2 wickets for 27 runs), Ashish Nehra (2 wickets for 42 runs) took wickets
 duusari taraf gujarat ke ballebaazon pradarshan kolkata ke kilaaf acha rahaa
 
 
 But the bowlers disappointed their captain Suresh Raina
 praveen kumaar (2 over 13 ran, koi wicket nahin) ko chhod den to dhaval kulkarni (4 over main 42 ran koi wicket nahin) or shivil kowshik (4 over, 40 ran koi wicket nahin) kaa pradarshan bhula dene vaala sabit hua
 Looking at the first matches of both the teams, Hyderabad have a big edge in this match, but Warner would not like to make the mistake of weakening Raina's army
 hyderabad ke liye captain david warner kaa karaab form fikr kii baat ho sakati he lekin iske baavjood pichhali baar kii champion team santulit nazar aa rahi he
 In the last match, runs for Hyderabad were scored by Yuvraj Singh (62 runs off 27 balls), Mozes Henriquez (52 runs off 37 balls) and Shikhar Dhawan (40 runs off 31 balls)
 yuvaraj kii pehle hi match main dhuandhar ballebaaji ne warner ko khush kar diya he
 He is hopeful that the bat of this Chandigarh player will continue to blaze in the following matches as well
 agar gendbaazon kii baat kare to afghanistan ke raashid khan (36 ran dekar 2 wicket), bhubaneshwar kumaar (27 ran dekar 2 wicket), ashish nehra (42 ran dekar 2 wicket) wicket nikaale
 On the other hand, Ballebazon of Gujarat performed well against Kolkata
 
 
 lekin gendbaazon ne apane captain suresh raina ko niraash kiya
 Barring Praveen Kumar (2 overs 13 runs, no wickets), the performances of Dhawal Kulkarni (42 runs in 4 overs with no wickets) and Shivil Kaushik (4 overs, 40 runs with no wickets) proved to be forgotten
 donon tiimon ke pehle maichon ko dekhte hue is muqaabale main hyderabad kaa palada baari dikhaai detaa he lekin warner iske baavjood raina kii sena ko kamazor aankane kii galati nahin karnaa chahenge

 apane chaheton ke bich guruji ke naam se prasiddh pandit purushottam goud ne pichley 13 varsho main rajasthan ke kareeb 300 mandiron main jalsangrakshan dhaanche kaa vikaas kiya he
 Gaud has been awarded several honors including Maharana Mewar Award for his remarkable work in the field of social service and astrology
 hindu mandiron main bhakton dwaara arpit lakhon galen jal naaliyon main bah jaataa tha
 Gaud said that in the year 2000, he started his Jalabhishek campaign
 41 varshiya jyotishi goud ne bataaya, "maine gaur kiya ki mandiron main shraddhaluon dwaara arpit jal puri tarah naaliyon main bekaar chalaa jaataa he
 So i thought of using them to recharge ground water
 " After this, he started collecting water in temples, especially pagoda
 bhoomi main bhejne se pehle jal ko kai filter chambaron se guzaara jaataa he
 Gaur said that under this project many tanks and borewells were built in the temples with public support
 goud ne kaha, "kuch mandiron main 30 foot gaharaa gaddha khodne kii jarurat padi taaki pratimaaon kaa jal sidhaa vahaan ekatrit ho sake
 a separate five-foot pit was needed to deposit the milk to be mounted on the statues
 " Gaur continued, "I was very happy when many scientists and groundwater experts came to my aid and put forward an organization called 'shiksha Samiti' in this work
 is santhaan ne hisaab lagaaya ki shahar main 300 se zyada mandir hai jahaan shravan maheene main rojaanaa kam se kam chaar karod 50 lakh litre jal bhagwaan shiv va anya devi devataaon kii pratimaaon par arpit kiya jaataa he

 Mosquitoes and flies thrive around the temple
 " Regarding the difficulties faced in water conservation work, Gaud said that initially it was not easy to convince the priests

 Even when his supporters started collecting money for this project, the priests continued to ignore

 In Hindu temples, millions of gallons of water offered by devotees flowed into the drains
 goud ne bataaya ki varsh 2000 main unhone apana jalabhishek abhiyaan shuru kiya
 41-year-old astrologer Gaud said, "I noticed that the water offered by the devotees in the temples goes completely waste in the drains
 isliye mujhe inkaa bhoojal ko richarge karne main istemaal karne kii yukti suujhi
 " iske baad unhone mandiron khaas kar shivalayon main jal sangrah karne kaa kaam shuru kiya
 The water is passed through several filter chambers before being sent to land
 goud ne kaha ki is pariyojna ke tahat mandiron main jan sahyog se kai tanks or borwell kaa nirmaan karaayaa gaya
 Gaud said, "in some temples, a 30-foot deep pit was required to be dug so that the water of the idols could be collected directly there
 pratimaaon par chadhaae jane vaale doodh ko jamaa karne ke liye paanch foot ke gadde kii alag se jarurat padi
 " goud ne aage kaha, "mujhe tab behad khushi hui jab kai vaigyanik or bhoojal visheshgy meri madad ke liye saamne aae or 'shiksha samiti' naam ke ek sanghathan ko is kaam main aage kiya
 The institute calculated that there are more than 300 temples in the city where at least 40 million liters of water is offered daily in the month of Shravan to the idols of Lord Shiva and other deities
 " unhone kaha ki is barbaadi ke alaava shraddhaluon dwaara arpit jal or dugdh kaa paryaavaran par bhi vipareet prabhaav padataa he
 The comments goud ne bataaya, "aam taur par mandir ke sameep jal or dugdh ko nirbaadh bahane diya jaataa he
 This creates an unhealthy environment

 However, the BJP is also trying to bring Dushyant Chautala into its fold
 congress ko ab faisla karnaa hoga ki kya vah bijepi ko satta se dur rakhane ke liye vah dushyant chautaala ko siem banane ke liye taiyaar ho jayega
 But this decision will not be easy for the Congress and because Bhupendra Singh Hooda who has worked hard for the Congress in Haryana does not join the government and if he joins, then work as a junior from Dushyant Chautala
 haalanki abhi haryana main tasviir saaf hone thodaa or vakt lag saktaa he
 But it is for analysis that states like Haryana where a large number of people work in the army and security forces, have not too much effect on the removal of Article 370 from Jammu and Kashmir and on this basis BJP claim It was said that it will get 75 seats more in the state

 The memories of those days of the 90s are still fresh when Gulzar's song 'jungle Jungle Baat Chali Hai Rekha Hai Chadhi Pahan Ke Phool Khil Hai Phool Khil Hai Hai' on Doordarshan echoed
 tippaniyan At that time, Gulzar wrote the animation film 'jungle Book' in which music was given by Vishal Bhardwaj and now the pair have come together once again to give a new look to this song of 'the Jungle Book'
 farq sirf itnaa he ki is baar 'da jangal book' ek anemation film nahin balki isame nazar aaenge jite jaagate kirdaar, haa film main special effects kaa sahaara kaafii liya gaya he
 Although the song has been kept the same, ie 'jungle Jungle Baat Chali Hai Pyaar Hai Chaddi Pahan Ke Phool Khil Hai Phool Khil Hai', but the rest of the lines have been changed and the singers are also new

 5 starvijay krishna acharya ne dhooma, dhooma 2, pyaar ke said effects, guru jaisi filmon main kabhi screenple to kabhi samvaad likhane kaa kaam kiya
 Later he also directed "tashan" with Akshay Kumar, Saif Ali Khan and Kareena Kapoor
 iske baad aamir khan ke saath dhooma 3 or ab amitabh bachchan or aamir khan ko lekar "thags of hindustan" banaai he
 The teaser and trailer of the film was quite grand
 pehali baar amitabh bachchan or aamir khan ko ek saath, parde par dekhne kaa kaam bhi puraa hua he
 Will this film be able to hit the box office and the hearts of the audience on the occasion of Diwali, let us know how this film is finally made
 
 
 kya he film kii kahani ?film kii kahani 1795 ke bharat kii he, jab bharat par east india company kaa raaj tha or bahut saare rajya angrejon ke haathon main the
 But Raunakpur was a state that was far from the grip of the British
 vahaan kaa senapati khudabaksh jahaji (amitabh bachchan) apane mirza sahab (ronit roy) kaa or puure pradesh kaa khyaal rakhata tha
 Mirza Sahib dies due to some reasons and the responsibility of his daughter Zafira (fatima Sana Sheikh) falls in the hands of Khudabkhsh
 isi bich, kahani 11 saal aage badhati he or phir firangi mallaah (aamir khan) kii entry hoti he jo apni daadi kii kasam khaakar kisi se kitna bhi jhooth bol saktaa he
 He has only one purpose, to make money
 bollywood main bete kii entry par kya sochate hai aamir? pehali baar batayisi bich khuda baksh or firangi mallaah kii meeting hoti he
 The twist in the story comes when General Clive of the East India Company starts harassing them all
 suraiya (katrina caff) angreji shaskaon kaa dil bahalane kaa kaam karti he
 There are many turns in the story and finally a result comes which one has to watch to know the film
 kyon dekh sakate hai filofilm kii kahani dilachasp he lekin nirdesan kamjor
 The pace of the story becomes sluggish in many places
 ise or behatar kiya ja saktaa tha
 However the way the 17th century is depicted is wonderful
 amitabh ne ek baar phir se behtareen abhinay kaa kiya he
 Aamir Khan has tried very hard to win hearts
 jo mukammal bhi hui he
 Many of the sequences filmed between the two are amazing
 film main fatima sanaa shaikh ne sahaj abhinay kiya he
 As well as the rest of the film's characters like Ronit Roy Ila Arun's work is also good
 katrina caff kaa role bahut kam he, lekin thik he vahiin mohammad jishaan ayub ne badhiya abhinay kiya he
 Before the release, the film's VFX was being talked about as lacking
 lekin film dekhne ke dauraan acha viefex dekhne ko miltaa he
 The background score of the film is also good
 aamir or mohammad jishaan ayub, kai maukon par hansaate hai jisaki vajah se film dekhne kaa majaa or behatar hota he
 Before the release, it was said that Aamir's character resembles the English film Pirates of the Caribbean, while watching it does not feel like it at all
 film relies ke vakt buree lat main funs jate hai aamir, patni ko pareshanikamjor kadiyaan: nirdesan ne kiya niraashfilm kii kamjor kadi isaki length he jo kaaphi lambii jaan padati he
 Had it been shortened, the film would have been even more interesting
 film kii relies se pehle iske gane bhi prachlit nahin ho paae hai jisaki vajah se jo baj hona chahie tha vah nahin ban paaya he
 During filming, large songs are shown which should have been shortened
 climex or behatar ho saktaa tha
 Vijay Krishna Acharya's direction is weak
 nirdesan main dhar se is film ko bachaaya ja saktaa tha
 The story of the film is also one that may not be liked by everyone
 khaastaur par angreji filmein dekhne vaali audiyans ko film ke effect prabhavit na kar paaen

 Income tax thieves may find it very expensive to show off their money and lifestyle on social networking sites
 inakam tex vibhaag ke adhikari sandigdh tex choron par soshal media ke jariye bhi najar banaae hue hai
 The interesting thing is that the department is also using some special software for this
 inakam taxvibhag bank khate se len-dein, cash, property, gahane or anya kisi prakaar kii tranjection par najar rakhkar sandigdh tex choron par najar rakh rahaa he
 Through this, the difference between declared and real earnings is being tried, so that they can be questioned on the basis of need
 vibhaag is padtaal ke adhaar par tex vasuulne kii karrwai bhi kaaphi samay se kar rahaa he
 Photographs and declared income are matched
 It is said that even those who are on the radar of the taxpayer department, their foreign visits and purchase of expensive vehicles are also part of the investigation of the authorities
 isi jaanch main pichley kuch vakt se soshal media ek ahm bhoomika nibhaa rahaa he
 If the taxpayer wants to avoid paying the tax by citing losses or low earnings, the officials show it on social media by showing their expensive cars and photos of foreign trips to the respective taxpayer by matching the declared income
 koi minial yaa circularais kaam ke liye inakam tex vibhaag kuch khaas software kaa bhi istemaal bhi kar rahaa he
 Apart from this, Informer Network is also being used
 haalanki jaanch ke ye nae tareeke kisi minial yaa circular ke jariye inakam tex adhikariyon ko aadhikarik taur par naa sikhaye gaye hai or naa hi department ne inhen istemaal karne kii sifarish kii he
 But in view of their usefulness, this informal trend of investigation in income tax authorities is also increasing
 ghatati he nijee jindagi main dakhlandajiiske istemaal ke paksh main tark ye bhi diya jaataa he kii jahaan ek taraf iske istemaal se taxpere kii nijee jindagi main jaanch ke jariye dakhlandaji kii sambhaavna ghatati he, kyonki isamen saarvjaanik taur par uplabdh jaankaree kaa hi istemaal hota he
 Apart from this, harassment of taxpayer is also reduced in this way

 His wife Neetu Kapoor has been with him since Rishi has gone to New York
 ranbir kapur bhi pita kii sehat kaa haalchaal lene neuyork jate rahete hai
 The seriousness of Rishi Kapoor's illness seems to be from the fact that he did not return to India even after the death of his mother Krishna Raj Kapoor last year
 neuyork main rishi kapur kaa haalchaal jaanane ke liye bollywood stars aksar unhen visit karte hai
 Hello all! i am taking a short leave of absence from work to go to America for some medical treatment
 i urge my well wishers not to worry or unnecessarily speculate
 It's been 45 years "plus" of wear and tear at the movies

 Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut's press conference was first followed by Ajit Pawar as the culprit for the entire story
 sanjay raut ne kaha ki ajit pavaar par pehle se hi andeh tha
 He was not talking with an eye in the night meeting
 jiske man main galat karne kii baat hoti he uskaa body lagvange dikhne lagata he
 Sins are committed in the dark of night
 sanjay raut ne kaha ki ajit pavaar ne maharashtra kii janata or shivaji maharaj ke vichaaron ke saath vishwasghaat kiya he

 ham ajit ke khilaaf ection lenge
 He said that there was no such hope from Ajit Pawar
 patrakaron dwaara puche gaye ek sawaal ke jawaab main sharad pavaar ne kaha ki mujhe koi chintaa nahin he, mere saath pehle bhi aisa ho chukaa he
 Pawar said that we have the number, we will form the government

 President's rule was imposed in the state on November 12 after no party or coalition claimed to form the government
 loksabhaa chunaav 2019 kii tarikhon ke elaan ke baad party ke netaaon ke bich tikat ko lekar khinchataan shuru ho gai he
 BJP MP Sakshi Maharaj has threatened her own party over the ticket
 unhone upi bijepi adhyaksh mahendra nath pandey ko patr likhakar kaha ki agar unhen tikat nahin diya gaya to iskaa parinaam acha nahin hoga
 He wrote in his letter that there is no representation of OBC voters in his constituency Unnao
 lekin unhone apni mehnat se party ko khadaa kiya he
 This is the reason why the party won the seat of Unnao in 2014 after nearly 15 years
 bataa den ki congress ne unnav seat se apane ummidavaar ke naam kii ghoshnaa kar di he
 Congress has again given ticket to Anu Tandon from Unnao Lok Sabha seat

 Sakshi Maharaj got a big win in the Modi wave last time
 unako 43 fisadi se zyada vot mili the jabaki duusare number par rahi samaajawaadee party ko maatr 17
 37 percent votes were received
 aazaadee ke baad hue chunaavon main congress lagaataar 6 baar is seat se jitati rahi or kul 9 baar yah seat uske khate main ja chuki he
 Congress candidate Anu Tandon won here in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections as well
 bijepi ke dev baksh singh bhi is seat se lagataar teen baar saansad ban chuke hai
 While the BSP and Samajwadi Party have won the elections from this seat once
 sapa-basapa gathbandhan ke tahat is baar yahaan se samaajawaadee party apana pratyaashee utaaregi
 However, the name has not been decided yet
 vahiin baat karen sakshi maharaj kii to apane bayanon kii vajah se vah kai baar bijepi or piem modi kii mushkil main daal chuke hai or beete paanch saalon main unako kai alaakaman samajha bhi chukaa he
 Now the thing to see will be whether their party gives tickets this time or not
 khabar he ki bijepi is baar saansadon kaa report card hi dekhakar dobaaraa tikat degi

 co / at4cfn4ow3 Today the lifestyle of most people is such that they are unable to pay attention to their health
 ast-vyast lifestil ke chalate hi zyaadaatar logon kaa immune system kaaphi kamjor ho gaya he
 If we talk about men then there are a large number of men who do not live healthy lifestyle
 kai baar unhen cigarette pine, sharaab pine jaisi buree lat bhi lag jaati he
 These bad habits further deteriorate the lifestyle
 in buree aadaton ke chalate kab wo shaks ek marij ban jaataa he, khud use bhi nahin pataa chalata he
 Smoking cigarettes and drinking alcohol are just two examples
 iske alaava kai aisi aadaten hai jo purushon ko kamjorbana detii he:1
 Many campaigns have been conducted and are still being run to convince people about not smoking cigarettes
 cigarette pine se sharir main andar hi andar kai tarah kii bimaariyaan palane lag jaati hai
 Due to this, the body gradually becomes weaker
 2
 Consuming too much alcohol in excessive quantity has a very bad effect on the body's immunity
 dhire-dhire sharir bimariyon se ladane main asamarth hone lagata he orek sthiti aisi bhi aati he jab sharir ke kai mahatvapurn ang kamakarna band kar dete hai
 3
 khud se hi dawa le lenouksar purushon main ye aadat hoti he ki wo biimaar hone par yaa phir bukhaar hone par bina kisi doctor se salaah liye medical store se koi bhi dawa lekar kha lete hai
 This is the wrong habit
 jisaki vajah se kai tarah kii dikkatein pesh aa sakati hai
 4
 khud main hi simatakar rah jaanaashaayad aapako pataa na ho lekin logon se milane-julne main ek dawa sa asar hota he
 Many times a man becomes mentally ill while living alone and he himself does not know that he is becoming ill
 aajkal kii vyast jindagi main offis se aane ke baad zyaadaatar purushon ko lagata he ki kisi or se milane se behatar he ki wo ghar par hi aaraam karen
 But not meeting people can also be the first stage of depression
 5
 Ignoring Exercise While food is badly affected due to private lifestyle, it is difficult to find time for exercise too
 ekbar ye aadat chhot jaati he to use dobaaraa shuru kar paanaa bahut mushkil ho jaataa he

 bhashaa se input After Sheila Dixit, her son Sandeep Dixit today strongly attacked the way the Congress is running and said that its 'elitist' culture produces 'arrogance' and does not have leaders in the true sense
 purv saansad or shila dikshit ke putr sandip dikshit ne dharmanirpekshata se jude mudde par bijepi yaa aarthik muddon par aam aadmi party kii nakal karne ke prati bhi aagaah kiya
 Dixit strongly advocated bringing new ones into the party, saying 50 per cent of seniors in Congress and 70 per cent in NSUI and Youth Congress are 'undesirable'
 unhone kaha ki samskruti (congress main) sambhrantvaadi ban gai he or isse ahankaar panapata he
 In such a situation our cadres are uncomfortable
 party par dikshit kaa yah nishaanaa aise samay kiya gaya he, jab kal unki maa shila dikshit ne dilli vidhansabha chunaav main party kii sharmnaak paraajay ke liye congress ke mukhyamantri pad ke ummidavaar ajay maakan par hamalaa bolaa tha, jise party ke netaa pisi chaako or arvinder singh lavali ne khaarij kar diya tha
 To this, party president Sonia Gandhi intervened and asked the leaders not to get involved in public debate
 sandip dikshit ne apni aalochana main kisi kaa naam nahin liya, lekin yah paroksh rup se party upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi par kataaksh tha, jab unhone kaha ki party main chunaav karaane se hi loktantr shuru yaa khatm nahin hota
 He said that democracy starts with the idea of allowing leaders to lead and allowing the actions of democracy
 50-varshiya dikshit do baar saansad rahe hai
 He said that the Congress has to identify its best leaders and ideas, public issues rather than party issues
 congress main nae logon ko laana sabase zyada mahatvapurn he
 About 50 per cent of seniors in Congress and 70 per cent in Youth Congress and NSUI are undesirable
 unhone pichley saal loksabhaa chunaavon ke baad haal ke dilli chunaavon sahit lagaataar paanchavi chunavi paraajay kaa saamana karne vaali congress ke liye kaha ki waapas yah party ginati main tab laut sakati he, jab mahatma gandhi jaise logon ke muddon ke saath isaki pahchaan ban sake
 He said, you cannot identify with the poor by wearing glasses of Rayban
 congress ko party muddon kii bajaay janata ke muddon or apane behtareen netaaon or vichaaron kii pahchaan kerani hogi
 Bringing new people in Congress is of paramount importance
 unhone kaha ki congress ko nae logon ko laana hoga
 These people will come not through elections, but through selection, new ideas and issues
 unhone saath hi kaha ki party ko nakal kii raajnneeti nahin kerani chaa ICICI Bank, the country's largest private bank, has announced an increase in its ATM charges for savings account holders from 1 January next year

 Will have to spend 50 rupees
 gaiyr-metro kshetron main upyog ke sambandh main graahak gaiyr-isiaisiai bank ke atm kaa prati maah paanch baar muft upyog kar sakenge, jiske baad shulk lagegaa

 Uddhav has also given a befitting reply to this attack by Raj Thackeray
 shivasena ke mukhpatr 'saamana' main uddhav ne kaha ki jo shivasena pramukh balasaheb thakare kaa nahin hua wo kisi or kaa kya hoga
 Apparently accepting Raj Thackeray's statement that 'this time Shiv Sena will show respect', Uddhav said that Raj can show whatever position he has to show
 uddhav ne kaha 'ham sher ke bachche hai billi ke nahin'
 Uddhav has also given his reaction to Raj's statement of Balasaheb Thackeray
 uddhav ne kaha ki balasahab kii samadhi sthal par laalkrishna adwani or sharad pavaar tak aae lekin raaj nahin aae jabaki unka ghar samadhi sthal ke bilkul paas he
 Uddhav responded to Raj Thackeray and said that we have not sold any plots but if someone proves it, we will leave politics and who knows all the builders
 uddhav ne kaha 'log kehete hai ki ham riginal party hai lekin original hai
 'the way Uddhav has heard Raj Thackeray unabashedly, now it is to be seen what color and color the war between two brothers in this election season shows

 xxrep 62 - The Supreme Court has rejected the disputed land Ramlala in the judgment, the Deenirmohi Akhara and the Shia Waqf Board, on Saturday, the Supreme Court has given its historic verdict on the Ayodhya dispute
 supreme court ne vivaadit jameen kaa malikana haq ramalala ko diya he
 While the Sunni Waqf Board has been ordered by the court to give 5 acres of land for the mosque in a separate place in Ayodhya itself
 iske saath hi court ne sarkaar ko 3 maheene ke bheetar trust banaakar mandir nirmaan kii ruparekha tay karne ke liye bhi kaha he
 Let us tell you that a decision of five judges headed by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi gave this decision unanimously
 supreme court ne apane faisle main puri vivaadit jameen ramalala ke naam kar dijabaki 30 sitambar, 2010 ko elahabaad hai court ne 2
 77 acres of land was divided
 hai court ne sunni vakf board, nirmohi akhaada or ramalala ke bich jameen baraabar-baraabar baantne kaa aadesh diya tha
 The claim of some of the parties in the case has been rejected in the Supreme Court's decision on 9 November 2019
 supreme court ne nirmohi akhaada, shiya vakf board kaa malikana haq kaa daawa khaarij kar diya
 On the claim of Nirmohi Arena, the Supreme Court had said that their talk is outside the limit
 jabaki shiya vakf board ko lekar court ne kaha ki ve apana daawa sabit nahin kar paae
 Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas also did not get anything from the Supreme Court
 lekin phir bhi ye sabhi paksh is baat se khush hai ki supreme court ne is lambey vivaad kaa ant to kiya or ek faisla sunaaya
 The Nirmohi Arena was claimed on behalf of the Nirmohi Akhara that the internal and external enclosure of the disputed land is valid as the birthplace of Lord Rama
 ham ramalala ke sevaayat hai
 It has been in our possession for centuries
 supreme court ne apane faisle main is daawey ko limitesan ke baahar qaraar diya he
 However, the Supreme Court has given the government the authority to elect members of the trust in the judgment
 teen maheene main trust banane ke baad vivaadit jameen or adhigrahit bhoomi ke baaki hisse ko saunp diya jayega
 The Trust will then outline the construction of the Ram temple
 nirmohi akhaada ko trust main jagah milegi
 Mahant Dharmadas, senior panch of the Nirmohi Akhara, has said that there is no regret of rejecting the claim of the arena at the disputed site, as he too was favoring Ramlala
 iske alaava nirmohi akhaada ke pravaktaa karthik chopra ne kaha ki supreme court ne hamaari 150 saalon kii ladaai kaa sangyaan liya
 Kartik Chopra, spokesperson, Nirmohi Akhara: Nirmohi Akhara is grateful that SC has recognized our fight of last 150 years and has given the Nirmohi Akhara adequate representation in the trust to be set up by the Central Government to build & manage the Shri Ram Janmasthan Temple - ANI (@ANI) November 9, 2019 Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas claim Before the general elections of 1989, a leader of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad and retired judge Devki Nandan Aggarwal filed the fifth claim as a friend of Lord Ram on July 1 in Faizabad court
 Was
 is daawey main sweekaar kiya gaya tha ki 23 disambar 1949 ko ram chabutare kii murtiyon masjid ke andar rakhi gai thim
 Along with this it was clearly claimed that both the place of birth and Lord Rama are revered and he is also the owner of this property
 isi mukademe main pehali baar kaha gaya tha ki ram janm bhoomi nyaas is sthaan par ek vishaal mandir bananaa chahta he
 The Supreme Court considered the claims of this claim in the judgment but gave the ownership of the disputed land to Ramlala
 shiya vakf board kaa daawashia vakf board kii ore se board ke chairman syed wasim rizvi ne kaha tha ki saakshyon ke aadhaar par babari masjid shiya vakf ke adheen he
 It is different that in the last 71 years, it has not been claimed by the Shia Waqf Board
 unhone kaha ki vakf masjid mir baaki (babari masjid) shiya vakf ke tahat aati he
 However, the Shia Waqf Board has been openly talking about the construction of the temple at the disputed site
 shiya central vakf board ke adhyaksh wasim rizvi ne supreme court ke faisle par baat karte hue kaha ki supreme court ne bahut hi acha faisla diya he
 Our claim is rejected, there is no mistaking it
 ham hameshaa mandir nirmaan ke paksh main the or vahi ho rahaa he
 No review petition will be filed on our behalf

 The UPA government, which has been criticizing the issue of two Italian marines not returning to India, has taken a strong stand
 pradhanmantri manmohan sinhane buudhvaar ko chetavanee di ki agar italy ne bhartiya machuaaron kii hatya karne vaale apane do marinon (nausainikon) ko bharat waapas bhejne ke apane aashwaasan ko puraa nahin kiya to iske parinaam bhugatne honge
 On the issue being raised by members after the Question Hour in the Lok Sabha, Singh said, 'there can be no two opinions that what the Italian government has done is not fair
 hamaari sarkaar pehle hi spasht kar chuki he ki italy kaa yah vyavhaar sweekaarya nahin he
 He has violated the assurance given to the Supreme Court
 ’unhone kaha ki in marinon ko bharat waapas bheje jane ke sandarbh main supreme court ko italy dwaara diye gayi aashwaasan kaa jis tarah ulanghan kiya gaya he, vah dwipaksheeya rishton ke hit main nahin he
 Singh said, "we have told the Government of Italy to honor the affidavit given in the Supreme Court and send it back to both the marines
" yadi waapas nahin bheja jaataa he to iske parinaam bhugatne honge
 'it is noteworthy that these two Italian marines had allegedly shot and killed two Indian fishermen in the Indian sea area after which they were arrested
 isse pehle in do marine ko christmas or nav varsh manaane apane desh jane kii anumati adaalat ne di thi
 An affidavit was given from Italy that both marines would return to India and they also returned
 lekin italy main chunaav ke dauraan matdaan ke liye inhen phir apane desh jane kii ijaajat di gayi thi
 The Italian ambassador had submitted an affidavit in the Supreme Court that the two marines would return to India after the electoral process, but now in violation of the assurance Italy announced that the two marines would not be sent to India
 shoonyakaal main bijepi ke varisht netaa jaswant singh ne yah maamla uthaate hue kaha ki italy ke in do marine ne antarrashtriya samudri kshetra main nahin balki bhartiya samudri kshetra main or hamaare tat ke nikat desh ke do machuaaron kii goli markar hatya kar di or baad main kaha ki unhone in machuaaron ko samudri dasyu samajhakar maaraa tha
 He said that there is no problem of sea bandit on the Indian coast, nor the vessel on which these Italian marines were boarded, their country's flag was put on it, so they were not even entitled to take such action
 singh ne is baat ko hairaani bharaa bataaya ki pehle christmas or nav varsh tathaa baad main italy main matdaan main bhaag lene ke naam par hatya ke in aropiyon ko italy jane diya gaya
 He questioned the government whether inmates in Indian jails are released from jail to celebrate Holi, Diwali or Eid or are allowed to go to the polls at the time of elections? If this is not the case, then why were Italian marines treated with such special treatment? Singh said that the apex court, on the assurance of the Italian ambassador, allowed these marines to go to their country, but there was a provision that they would remain in the custody of the police even while in Italy
 unhone kaha ki videshiyon ke saath is tarah kaa vishesh vyavhaar desh main pehle bhi ho chukaa hai
 Warren Anderson, the main accused in the Bhopal gas scandal, was also allowed to leave the country
 purulia main hathiyaar giraane ke maamle ke aropiyon ko bhi sajaa puri kiye bina unke desh bhej diya gaya
 Not only this, the Italian businessman Ottavio Quattrocchi also helped the CBI to escape from Delhi
 singh ne kaha ki italvi sarkaar ne marine ke bare main supreme court ko diye aashwaasan ko todane kaa jo bartaav kiya he, use sarkaar ko bardaasht nahin karnaa chahie
 He asked the Prime Minister to explain how his government would rectify the issue arising out of this Italian conduct
 saath hi kaha ki vienna sandhi ke naam par bharat ke samvidhan kaa ulanghan nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Basudev Acharya of CPI (M) questioned that when there is a postal voting system in Italy, why did the Indian government let both marines go in the name of voting? He said that on the assurance of the Italian ambassador to India, the Supreme Court had allowed these marines to go to the polls, but since Italy has now broken the assurance to return to India, what action is the Indian government going to take against the ambassador Acharya also raised the name of Purulia Weapon Scandal and Quattrocchi, saying that India is a sovereign country and it is being referred to in the cases of foreign criminals by their governments Areas further should not bend like that would hurt the self-esteem of the country
 isse pehle prashnkaal main bhi pradhanmantri ne kaha ki is maamle main italvi adhikariyon ke vyavhaar se sadan or desh andolit he
 He said that he shares the concern of the members on the subject
 unhone kaha ki vah is maamle main kisi bhi tarah kii charchaa ke liye taiyaar hai

 bijepi or congress ek duusare par lagaataar hamlawar hai
 In this episode, Congress President Rahul Gandhi fiercely attacked PM Modi
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne piem modi (PM Modi) par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki skool jane vaale bachche bhi manaregaa samaj gaye, lekin desh ke pradhanmantri (PM Modi) ko yah aaj tak samaj nahin aayaa
 He said (rahul Gandhi), 'whenever we run the government we work for the poor as a thought
 modi ji ne loksabhaa main bhaashan diya or in yojanaon kaa majaak udaaya
 Modi ji said, see, MNREGA is a matter of 'shame'
 manaregaa sabase bekaar yojana he
 Nobody benefits from this
 congress ne logon ko thaga he
 He said in Jaipur, Rajasthan that PM could not understand MNREGA
 skool jate bachche ko samaj aa gaya, lekin desh ke pradhanmantri ko manaregaa samaj nahin aayaa
 Taking a dig at the PM, Rahul Gandhi said that Modi ji did not understand, because MNREGA was not just a work of digging pits
 is yojana ne karodon logon ko rojgaar diya
 Different things were made in the village under this scheme
 sadake baniin, talab baniin
 When people worked to make it, then money came to people
 paisa aayaa to logon ne chijen kharidni shuru kii
 When people bought things, people started making more things and employment was created
 piem ko yah nahin samaj aayaa ki jab tak aap garib kii jeb main paisa nahin daloge tab tak hindustan kii factriyaan shuru nahin hongi
 Rahul Gandhi said, 'we gave money in the pocket of the poor
 garib ke gharon main jab tak aapako sabun, sampu, nai shart nahin dikhaai degi tak hindustan kii arthvyavastha nahin chal sakegi
 The school-going child understands this, but the PM does not understand
 manaregaa ko aage badhanaa to dur piem ne notebandi kar di
 It happened that whatever money was left with you, the PM took it from you and put it in the bank
 unhone kaha, 'yah baat alag he ki aapse paisa lekar neerav modi ko de diya
 Because of demonetisation, money was taken from the poor
 is vajah se logon kii kharidne kii kshamta khatm ho gai
 At present, people had not emerged from the ban on demonetisation that the PM imposed 'gabbar Singh Tax' (GST)
 isse chote udyogpati or tabah ho gaye
 Today the small shopkeeper is not doing business, just filling the GST returns
 taaki tex vaala aakar hamase paisa na maange
 Attacking the Prime Minister, Rahul said that today no employment is being created due to PM, neither the poor have money because of them
 45 saal main sabase zyada berogari aaj he
 He said that today no youth has any employment
 piem ne puraa kaa puraa system nasht kar diya he
 This person does not understand India
