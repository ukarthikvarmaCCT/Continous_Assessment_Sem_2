 somvaar raat wo motorcycle se gadkha thana kshetra ke aloni gaanv ja rahe the tabhi kuch aparaadhiyon ne unka peechha karnaa shuru kar diya
 Seeing the criminals chasing him, Piyush accelerated his bike and started running away but after going a short distance, the criminals caught him and killed him with a knife
 pratyakshdarshiyon ke anusaar piyush anand kimauke par hi mautaho gai
 According to the information, Piyush Anand himself has been an active member of the Bajrang Dal in the past and was currently associated with the business cell of the BJP

 The police have registered an FIR in this case and are trying to identify the culprits and arrest them

 The Rajya Sabha election to be held on 19 June in Bihar is nothing short of a thriller drama
 bijepi ke samarthan ke sahare sabir ali or anil sharma jediu pratyaashiyon ko maat dene main kaamyaab honge yaa phir apane dhur virdohi lalu yadav ke samarthan se bihar ke purv siem nitish kumaar loksabhaa chunaav main mili haar ke baad ek baar phir apni badshahath sabit karne main kaamyaab honge yah to voton kii ginati ke baad hi saaf hoga
 Meanwhile, politics is fast, politics of manipulation is in full swing and in such a situation the outcome of Jitan Ram Manjhi's government will also be determined to a large extent
 lalu bole, nitish tum aage badho ham tumhaare saath hainithish ne phone karke apane ummidavaaron ke liye samarthan maanga to pehle lalu ne pehle to siyaasi hamalaa kiya, phir vidhayak dal kii baithak kii duhai dekar aage kii ranneeti par suspence bana diya
 The legislature party met on Tuesday, 4 out of 21 mlas were absent
 iske baad ek or meeting hui
 The RJD supremo decided that it was necessary to beat bjp's politics so his party's mlas would support Nitish's candidates
 lalu ne diya samarthan to nitish bole
 
 
 Nitish did not delay in thanking, thanks to the support of THQRJD
 apane ghar par bulaai press conference main nitish ne kaha ki bijepi kaa asli cheharaa sabake saamne aa gaya he
 The BJP was planning to topple the Manjhi government but it would not succeed
 bijepi rajyasabha chunaav main khuleam partiyon main tod-phod main lagi hui thi, par yah sajeesh vifal ho gai he
 Our party thanks Lalu Yadav for his support
 lalu ke faisle ke baad bijepi kaa elaansiosi virodhiyon ke saath aane ke baad bijepi ne elaan kiya ki vah jediu ke baagi vidhayakon ke ummidavaar kaa samarthan karegi
 After the meeting with the party mlas, Sushil Modi said that his party will vote in favor of Sabir Ali and Anil Sharma
 kya he is rajyasabha chunaav kii ahmiyatin chunaavon par bahut had tak bihar kii maujuuda sarkaar kaa bhavishya tikaa hua he
 In fact, Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi was able to prove his majority in the Vidhan Sabha with the outside support of Congress, CPI and RJD
 lekin mantrimandal ke vistaar ke baad jediu ke kuch vidhayakon ne bagawati tevar akhriyaar kar liye
 The protest became public
 nishane par nitish kumaar aa gaye
 These mlas, considered supporters of JDU President Sharad Yadav, opened a front against the Rajya Sabha candidates of their own party
 pehle nishaanaa saadhaa phir do siton par apane ummidavaar bhi utaar die
 Sabir Ali and Anil Sharma, MD of real estate company Amrapali Group, filed a petition against Ghulam Rasul Baliyavi and former Ambassador Pawan Verma on behalf of JDU who got the support of the rebels
 haalanki nitish ab bhi is ummid main hai ki baagi waapas lautenge or jeet unki hi hogi
 If this happens then the coming days are good for the Jitan Ram Manjhi government
 lekin sabir ali yaa phir anil sharma kii jeet se nitish kii mushkilen bad jaaengi
 Especially it will be clear that now they do not have that influence in the party itself
 bihar main jald hi chunaav kii maangen tej ho jaaengi
 Many rebel mlas may leave the party in the coming days
 badal sakate hai dharm or jati aadhaarit siyaasi sameekaranbihar kii puri siyasat muslim matadaataaon ke aasapaas kendrit ho gai he
 Especially from the results of the Lok Sabha elections, it has become clear that the upper caste voters are completely with the BJP
 kabhi nitish ke samarthak maane jane vaale mahadalit votaron main bhi bijepi send lagane main kaamyaab hui he par vidhansabha main in matadaataaon kaa rukh kya hoga, yah aane vaala vakt hi tay karegaa
 While Yadav is still with Lalu, Nitish is the only option for Kurmi and Koiri voters
 par dharm ke aadhaar par dhruvikaran hota he to lalu or nitish bihar kii siyasat main haashiye par chale jaaenge
 In such a situation, about 16 percent of Muslim voters are important
 kya vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi ko maat dene ke liye lalu or nitish saath aaenge?iske bare main philhal kuch bhi kahana jaldbaaji hogi or jatigat sameekaran is dosti ke khilaaf hai
 Even though the Yadav and Kurmi castes used to be together during the Janata Dal era
 par varchasv kii ladaai main bihar main bahut kuch badal chukaa he
 Apart from these two castes, there are other castes in the Other Backward Classes whose role has become important
 in sabake bich yah saaf ho gaya he ki siyasat sirf loksabhaa chunaav hi nahin balki rajyasabha ke chunaavon main bhi haaavee rahati he
 Where Nitish has made it a question of prestige, the BJP is quietly playing its bets on the chess board without being exposed

 Due to this, the process of trains being late continues
 ghaney kohre kii vajah se jahaan darjanon trainen let chal rahi hai
 At the same time, many trains have also been canceled
 haalanki trainon kii is deree ke liye koharaa utana jimmedaar nahin he, jitna kii bhartiya railway kii susti
 There are many technologies, but the modern LED lights help to increase visibility

 aise main vah raftaar gata detaa he, taaki kisi tarah kii durghatana na ho
 The three-year-old technology test has been designed to deal with fog in India, the antigen-collision System (T-CAS), but it is still not implemented on a large scale
 bhartiya railway pichley teen saal se iske pareekshan main hi juty hui he
 In May this year, the Indian Railways said that it would make the railway safe by purchasing technology from France, Germany and other countries, but these deals are also not visible anywhere on the ground

 This system allows the driver to see signals from the cab signaling system while sitting in his cabin
 isse driver ko train kii raftaar halaat ke anusaar tay karne main madad milti he
 Techniques not proceeding from testing, preparations for installation of modern LED fog lights along with Protection Warning System (TPWS), Train Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) as well as Taryn Imaging for Diesel Drivers (tri-netra) system have been going on for a long time, But they are still under trial

 ek saal puraa hone ko he, lekin uske baad bhi is pranali kaa bade str par yuj shuru nahin kiya ja sakaa he
 In 2014, the Indian Railways commissioned the European company Thales to design the system
 lekin is vyavastha ke taiyaar hone ke ek saal baad bhi kohre se nipatane ke suraksha intjaam pukhta nahin hai
 The speed of the train decreases due to fog
 Even when there is a dense fog umbrella, visibility decreases significantly
 isaki vajah se driver raftaar ghataakar 15 kilometre prati ghanta tak le aate hai
 This causes trains to lie for 2 hours to 22 hours
 aisa nahin he ki kohre kii vajah se pehali baar trainen let ho rahi hai
 This is a series of every year
 har saal kai trainen ghaney kohre kii vajah se let ho jaati hai, lekin uske baad bhi railway kii taraf se koi bada kadam isse nipatane ke liye abhi tak nahin uthaaya gaya he
 The Fog that came before the technology of Indian Railways, although Fog starts showing its effects in December and January, but this year Fog has started showing its strength from November itself

 mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne rail bajet main bihar kii lambit rail pariyojnaon ko puraa karne ke liye paryaapt dhan kii vyavastha kiye jane kii maang kii he
 a lot of expectations from Pawan Bansal, what will happen in the budget? On a question asked about the Railway Budget, Nitish said that the approved projects of Railways in Bihar should be completed and there should be adequate funding for them
 unhone kaha ki in pariyojnaon ko samay puraa karne kii baat to ham log bhul hi gaye
 All the projects started during his (nitish Kumar's) railway minister had been fixed but the deadline could not be completed
 purv pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi ke netritv vaali rashtriya janatantric gathbandhan (rajg) sarkaar main nitish rail mantri rah chuke hai
 How safe are women in Indian Railways? Without naming Rashtriya Janata Dal President Lalu Prasad, who was the Railway Minister in the first term of the United Progressive Alliance government at the Center, Nitish said that after us, he became the Railway Minister of Bihar but he completely ignored the state
 Of
 nitish ne kaha ki patna jila ke digha se saaran jila ke sonpur ke bich ganga nadi par ban rahe rail or sadak pul kaa nirmaan kaary lambey samay tak lataka rahaa, usko ab tak puraa ho janaa tha par aisa hua nahin
 The time limit for construction of the rail-cum-road bridge to be built on the river Ganga in Munger district was also fixed but that too was not completed
 bajet purv roundtable: jhunjhuna nahin, sushasan chahieunhone kaha ki vah kuch din pehle rail mantri pawan bansal se mili the or unase bihar kii lambit rail pariyojnaon ko karne kaa anurodh kiya tha
 Both these rail bridges were also involved in that conversation
 nitish ne kaha ki yatriyon kii babbti sankhya ko dekhte hue patna or bihar ke anya sthanon se dilli, mumbai, kolkata or dakshin bharat sahit desh ke anya sthanon ke liye or rail gadiyon kii jarurat he khaskar dilli ke liye to sarvaadhik jarurat he
 He said that we had written a letter to the Railway Ministers before Bansal ji but this was not taken care of, but now hope that the number of trains will be increased in view of the increasing population of Bihar and the need for traffic
 10 bajet jiske chalate mili bharat ko nai dishanithish ne rajg sarkaar ke kaarykaal main kiye gayi kaaryon ko yaad karte huye kaha ki railway suraksha ke liye jo kaam ham log karke gaye uske chalate hi rail durghatnaon main kami aayi or railway trek evam signal system ko behatar banaaya gaya
 Without naming Lalu Prasad, who was the railway minister in UPA 1, Nitish said that the loss of the strength of rail tracks by increasing the excel load to rob the applause of increasing the revenue of the railway, now Pawan Bansal will be struggling with the same problem and his former The Railway Minister also faced the same situation
 nitish ne kaha ki maujuuda paristhiti main railway ko sanbhaalanaa or use phir se vicasonmukhi bananaa ek bady chunauti he
 He said that Railway Minister Pawan Bansal will have to take bold decisions
 unhone kaha ki railway ko is gambhir sthiti se nikaalkar uski lambit pariyojnaon ko samay par puraa karnaa hoga tabhi uskaa laabh use milegaa nahin pariyojnaon kii laagat babbti he jisase railway par boj badhata chalaa jayega tathaa uskaa laabh janata ko nahin milegaa

 The Advocacy Group of America has requested the Pakistani Prime Minister to reopen the border for millions of Muslim and Hindu devotees
 khokharapaar seemaa ke khulne se sant moinuddin chishti ke lakhon anuyaayiyon ko ajmer sthit chishti dargah par jane main suvidha hogi
 The Voice of Karachi said that at the same time this route will also allow Hindu pilgrims to visit the Hinglaj temple in Balochistan province of Pakistan
 edvocacy samooh muhajiron kaa ek group he jo urdu bhashi bhartiya musalamaanon kaa pratinidhitiv karata he or vibhaajan ke baad pakistan jaakar bas gaye the
 It says on its website that it is committed to raising global awareness about the plight of Pakistan's largest city, Karachi
 kartarpur coridor ko lekar shaq hoga!group ke nadeem nusrat nepakistan ke pradhanmantri imranako likhe ek patr main kaha, 'ab jab aapaki sarkaar ne pakistan main apane pavitra sthanon par jane ke liye sikh tirthayatriyon kii yatra ko suvidhajanak banaate hue kartarpur coridor ko kholkar jo saraahneey bhavyata dikhaai he, to main aapako kramshah sant moinuddin chishti or hinglaj devi ke lakhon muslim or hindu anuyaayiyon kii ore se anurodh karata hum ki tatkaal prabhaav se khokharapaar-munaabao seemaa ko kholaa jaae
 Nadeem Nusrat said that your decision will not only win millions of hearts, but it will also help in reducing the tension between people between the two countries
 agar aisa nahin hota he to un afvaahon or atakalon ko hawa degi ki kartarpur coridor khole jane ke peeche kii manshaa kuch or hi thi
 He said that millions of Muslims and Hindus living in India and Pakistan have been facing constant difficulties in visiting two places of worship since 1947
 ab aapane jis sahdayata ke sathkartarpur coridorko khulwaaya usee tarah se in donon muddon ko bhi jald se jald hal kiya ja saktaa he
 Four times longer journey millions of Muslims of India settled in the urban areas of Sindh province of Jopakistan
 unamem se badi sankhya main log abhi bhi hazrat moinuddin chishti ke prati gahari shraddha rakhte hai, or ajmer sthit chishti kii dargah kii yatra karnaa chaahate hai
 There should not be any dispute about this because Pakistan's Sindh province shares its border with Rajasthan in India, and the journey from Sindh's Khokhrapar border to Ajmer is just a few hours
 patr main kaha gaya ki yah maarg varshon se band he, jo logon ko punjab or dilli se hote hue ajmer tirth yatra ke liye chaar guna lambii yatra karne ke liye majaboor karata he
 This unnecessary long journey also places additional financial burden on the devotees

 Every year a large number of devotees make a four-day visit to the Hindu worshipers Hinglaj temple
 rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (aeres) aurabijepisanghathan netaaon ke saath lakhanu kii samanvay baithak meghmit shahne kaha ki vah khud chaahate hai ki mayawati or akhilesh yadav milakar karke 2019 kaa loksabhaa chunaav laden taakigathabandhanaki bhranti bhi dur ho sake
 However, people who keep an eye on the politics of the state believe that the KSP-BSP alliance can be a problem for the BJP
 baavjood iske kya bijepi adhyaksh vaaki chaahate hai ki gathbandhan ho yaa phir party kaaryakartaaon kaa mahaj manobal ko badhaane ke liye ye baat kah rahe hai, yah saaf nahin he
 Explain that the way of power of the country passes through Uttar Pradesh
 loksabhaa 2019 main vipaksh khaskar mayawati or akhilesh yadav jaiseupike do bade kshatrap gathbandhan kar bijepi or piem narendra modi ke liye isi raste ko rokane kii koshish main hai
 The coordination meeting was discussed in view of the changing political equation of Uttar Pradesh
 sapa or basapa ke gathbandhan se ubharne vaale raajnneetik chunautiyaan par bhi bijepi kii taraf se kai netaaon ne chintaa jaahir karte hue apni baaten rakhin
 On this, Amit Shah clearly told the party leaders that he himself wants the SP-BSP in the state to fight the BJP by forging an alliance so that the confusion of the alliance can be removed
 bijepi adhyaksh amit shah bhale hi sapa-basapa ke gathbandhan ko lekar chintit najar na aa rahe hon
 But if the two parties join the electoral fray together, it may be difficult for the BJP to repeat the results like 2014 in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 2014 main sapa-basapa ek hote tabagauratlab he ki saal 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main sapa or basapa ne alag-alag chunaav ladaa tha or tab bijepi gathbandhan ko 80 main se 73 siton par jeet mili thi
 However, see the figures of votes and if the SP-BSP came together in 2014, the picture would have been different
 modi lahar main bijepi ko 37 siton par jeet milti, jabaki 41 siten sapa-basapa ke khate main hoti
 42 to BJP in 2014 Lok Sabha Election
 30 fisadi vot mili the
 Whereas SP-BSP got 41 in total
 80 fisadi vot mili the
 7 to Congress then
 5 fisadi vot mili the
 In such a situation, if SP, BSP and Congress meet, this vote would be close to 50 percent
 2017 ke lihaaj se bijepi ko nuksaan2017 ke upi vidhansabha chunaav main mili voton ke aankadon ke lihaaj se denkhe to upi kii 80 loksabhaa siton main se sapa-basapa ke khate main 57 siten milti or unhen ausatan 1
 It would have won with 4
5 million votes
 jabaki bijepi ke khate main 23 seat aati or unhen ausatan 58 hajaar voton ke lead se jeet milti
 Varanasi, Mathura, Ghaziabad and Gautam Buddha seats would have won by 1 lakh
 bijepi is ummid main he ki agar sapa-basapa ek saath aate hai
 The votes of the two parties will not be transferred to each other in the election, because there are thirty-six figures among the workers of both parties
 aise main bijepi ko phayda mil saktaa he
 However, the results of the byelection are losing hope on the bjp's hope
 uttar pradesh ke gorakhpur, phulpur or kairana loksabhaa seat par hue upachunaav main sapa-basapa ke ek saath aane kaa bijepi ko nuksaan uthaanaa padaa he
 Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and Deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya have lost their seats
 darasal, upachunaav main bijepi ko mili haar ke baad bhi amit shah agar sapa-basapa ke gathbandhan kii chahat rakhte hai
 It is believed that the party will benefit from the obc's caste convention and Dalit convention organized by BJP in UP recently
 sapa-basapa ke ye mul votbank maane jate hai
 In such a situation, now it has to be seen that BJP gets the benefit or disadvantage of coming together with SP-BSP in 2019? janvari kii 10 taarikh ko bhubaneshwar main india today mind rox youth summit 2019 main 'aaj kaa bharat' or 'bhavishya kaa bharat' kaa aamanaa-saamana hua
 The auditorium of Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology was filled with energy of youth here
 unki abhibhoot nazren manch par maujuud manoranjan, khel or raajnneeti kii duniya kii mashhoor hastiyon par tiki thim
 They were listening to the struggles and success stories of their personal lives and also took mantras of becoming strong and combative in life
 jaani-maani hastiyon ko summit main bolne ke liye aamantrit kiya gaya tha
 In the shadow of colorful programs throughout the day, the feet of some stars sprang up on their own, adding to the atmosphere
 in sab ke bich is aayojan main yah baat spasht rup se ubhari ki aaj kaa yuva bharat kya sochataa he or kin manyataon main vishwaas karata he
 Whether it was Bollywood stars like Emraan Hashmi and Tapsee Pannu or politicians like Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik or members of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Congress, the presence of everyone was flowing into the auditorium differently
 pannu ne apane rishton main brake-ap or film industry main riject hone se upji pidaa kii baat saajha kii
 He said, "there is no harm in falling, but it is a bad thing not to stand back on your feet
" '' hashmi ne manch par kuch ladakiyon ke saath dance karke unhen sacvamohit kar diya tha
 He talked about his new film Why Cheat India at the summit and said that how cheating has become organized crime which helps the unqualified people to pass important examinations of medical and engineering through cheating
 haalanki, darshakon ko unke pehle chumban, pehle krash or saath kaam karne vaali heroin ke saath unki chemistry kii kahani main zyada dilchaspee thi
 Not only this, the scope of interest of the people involved in Mind Rocks 2019 was more than personal stories of Bollywood actors in the debate related to political issues
 india today ke group edetorial diarector (publicing) raaj chengappa ne bahut sahi tippanee kii ki ''aaj or aane vaale kal kaa bharat'' raajnneeti main dilchaspee lene laga he or vibhinn muddon par apni raay bhi bana rahaa he—chaahe baat aarthik rup se kamjor saamaanya varg ke liye 10 fisadi aarakshan kii ho, yaa bharat ke agle pradhanmantri ke liye sambhavit ummidavaaron kii
 Patnaik spoke of the importance of prioritizing his issues before choosing the party to vote for the students
 loklubhaavan chunavi naaron or dharm ke naam par istemaal hone se inkaar kar rahi yuva peedi ko mukhyamantri ne salaah di, ''apni praathamiktaaon par gaur karen or uske baad party ke rajnatik ghoshnaptr ko dekhen ki aap kis par sabase zyada bharosa karte hai or tab hi apana keemtee vot daalen
 During the session with mps, Congress's Sushmita Dev, Biju Janata Dal (BJD) President Kalikesh Narayan Singh Dev and bjp's Nishikant Dubey had a heated debate on the topic Narendra Modi vs Rahul Gandhi
 lekin, haal hi main saamaanya shrenee main 10 pratishat aarakshan sambandhi sanvaidhanik praavdhaan par koi khaas samarthan nahin dikhaa
 Students put more emphasis on providing equal employment and Kalikesh's suggestion, "there is a need to move towards the goal of giving equal opportunity to all with a 100 percent merit-based system to the country

 jis tarah uski zindagi ek chhalaava he, thik usee tarah uski maut bhi ek paheli he
 There is again a news about the death of ISIS leader Abu Bakr Al Baghdadi
 syria ke state televijan ne daawa kiya he ki syria ke rakka shahar main 11 june ko hue hawaii hamale main bagdadi maaraa gaya he
 By the way, before the world believes in Baghdadi's death, let us tell you that this is the seventh news of Baghdadi's death in the last two years
 rus ne kiya bagdadi kii maut kaa daawaek baar phir hua he bagdadi par ab tak ke sabase bade hamale kaa daawa
 This time this claim has been made by Russia
 russian army ne kaha he ki 28 may ko usne syria main aies ke majboot garh rakka main hawaii hamalaa kiya tha
 According to the army, many other leaders including the top leader of the IS have been killed in this attack
 aapako bataa den ki kuch din pehle hi syria ke state television ne ye daawa kiya tha or ab khud russian army ye daawa kar rahi he
 Rain of death in Raqqa: The rain of white death has come from the sky in Raqqa, its stronghold in Syria and the world's most feared terrorist and ISIS kingpin Abu Bakr al Baghdadi killed in this rain
 ye safed maut vahi he jo aaj se kareeb dedh saal pehle roosi hawaii sena ne syria ke idaleeb shahar main barasaai thi
 When the sky shone with white light in the darkness of night and then the orange fire took the whole area into its limelight
 or jab ye sab ruka to ilaake main har chiz aag lagane kii vajah se jalakar khak ho chuki thi
 Now a similar attack has been claimed in the Syrian city of Raqqa, a stronghold of Baghdadi and ISIS
 bagdadi kii baithak par hamalaataza daawey main roosi raksha mantralay ne kaha he ki uttari syria ke rakka main islamic state kii military council kii miting ko nishane banaakar ye karrwai kii gai thi
 Apart from Baghdadi, 30 IS commanders and 300 fighters were present
 unki sena ne SU-34 or SU-35 vimaanon se rakka ke paas hawaii hamale kiye hai
 The city is considered to be a stronghold of ISIS
 28 may ko hui is hawaii bambaari main iesas kaa leader abu bakar al bagdadi maaraa gaya
 Apart from this, many top ISIS commanders have also been killed in this attack
 hamale kii tasviir jarirus kaa kahana he ki unhen khabar mili thi ki ISIS ke top cmanders kii ek khufia baithak ho rahi he, jisamen khud bagdadi bhi maujuud tha
 So Russian airplanes targeted this meeting in their bombing
 jisamen bagdadi kii maut ho gai
 a picture of this bombing has also been released by the Russian Army
 syria ke sarkari tivi channel kii khabar ke baad ab roosi sena kii taraf se is khabar kii pushti karnaa kaaphi vishwasaneey strot mana ja rahaa he
 Since this news came from Russia's Ministry of Defense
 aise main iske sahi hone kii sambhaavna kaaphi zyada he
 Syria TV confirmed Baghdadi was killed before Syrian state television reported that Abu Bakr al-baghdadi, the head of ISIS, was killed in the white phosphorus bombings of Syria and the coalition forces in the city of Raqqa
 ek bade videshi akhbaar main bhi chhapi khabaren or internet par jari hui hamale kii footage ke mutabik gathbandhan sena ne syria ke rakka main aatanki thikaanon par tabadatod hamale kiye
 It is clear in the footage that the army attacked the building in a particular area of raqqa with a white phosphorus bomb
 mana ja rahaa he ki jis ilaake ko nishaanaa banaaya gaya vahaan na sirf iesas ke hathiyaaron kaa zakhira tha balki khud iesas kaa sargana abu bakar al bagdadi bhi maujuud tha
 The terrorist attack in the Phosphorus attack is a step ahead of the claims of the Ministry of Defense of Syria, that the Syrian state television claims that the most dreaded terrorist in the world has been killed in this Phosphorus attack
 haalanki iesas kii taraf se aisi koi pushti hui he
 But it is being said that the footage related to the attack on the Internet has been released by the news agency Amaq, which belongs to the organization itself
 vahiin intelegence agenciyon ne bhi ye daawa kiya he ki ye sahi he ki aatanki group kaa leader bagdadi mausul se bhagkar syria main apni swaghoshit rajdhani rakka kii taraf gaya he
 And because of this claim, the Syrian army officials are not withdrawing from confirming the death of Baghdadi on social media
 bagdadi kaa uttaradhikari bhi halaksiria sena ke adhikari maajik ab kabaudi ne ghoshnaa karte hue kaha ki iesas kaa leader abu bakar al bagdadi maaraa gaya he
 Similarly, Khalid Razzaq of Syrian State Television has confirmed that the terrorist Abu Bakr al-baghdadi was killed in an airstrike in the city of Raqqa, Syria
 bagdadi ke maare jane kii khabar aise vaqt main ai hai
 When his successor, Ayad al-jumali, is said to have been killed in an airstrike on the syria-iraq border
 jumali iesas kaa doosraa sabase bada netaa or yuddh mantri tha
 Many agencies have confirmed the news
 No major agency has confirmed the death of Baghdadi, but apart from the Russian Ministry of Defense and Syrian State Television, many other media including Syrian activist, Raqqa are confirming this news
 haalanki britain sthit sirian obzarvetry for human rhite ne mana he ki gathbandhan senaaon ne rakka par hawaii hamale kiye hai jisamen 13 nagarikon ke maare jane kii khabar he
 This is not the first time Baghdadi's death is being claimed
 isse pehle bhi kai baar aise daawey kiye jate rahe hai
 But each time this 25 million dollar dreaded terrorist becomes alive even after dying
 6 baar aa chuki he bagdadi kii maut kii khabararakka shahar main gathbandhan sena hawaii hamale kii baat to kai agenciyaan maan rahi hai
 Many people are also confirmed dead in this attack
 magar bagdadi kii maut ko lekar america samet baaki ke desh philhal kisi bhi tarah kaa daawa karne se batch rahe hai
 One reason for this is that it can also be the propaganda of the Syrian army so that the army can be encouraged
 or bagdadi kii maut kii pushti na karne kii duusari vajah ye bhi he ki isse pehle bhi chah baar uski maut kii khabar aa chuki he
 Syrian state television news of the death of Baghdadi in the Phosphorus attack of the coalition forces in Raqqa is sure
 magar ye khabar sahi ho us par itani aasaani se yakeen nahin kiya ja saktaa he

 According to the English newspaper Indian Express, this article with the headline 'across the Fury' alleges that Muslim leaders teach Indian Muslims to hate the country's tradition
 isamen kaha gaya he, 'akhlaaq (dadri main maare gaye peedit) ne shaayad inhen buree naseehaton ke prabhaav main aakar ek gaay ko maaraa hoga
 Questioning the authors on this issue, the magazine has written that why should they remain calm on the matter? The article said, 'veda orders that take the life of a cow slayer
 hamamen se bahuton ke liye to yah jivan-maran kaa prashn he
 'this article has been written by the Hindi writer Tufail Chaturvedi (vinay Krishna Chaturvedi)
 isamen kaha gaya he, 'gohatya hamaare liye itani badi baat he ki saikadon saal se hamaare purvaj ise rokane ke liye apni jaan kii baaji laga kar hatya karne waalon se takaraate rahe hai
 There have been hundreds of times in history when Muslim invaders have put beef in their mouths to make Hindus Muslims

 On the other hand, reacting to the article, RSS ideologue Rakesh Sinha said that it is wrong to describe the Sangh's opinion of a writer's 'digibhit' opinion in Panchajanya
 unhone kaha ki yah lekhak kii nijee raay he

 In fact, when a reporter asked Bhim Singh about not going to the airport, he said, 'jawans are only for martyrdom

 You will be martyred a little bit
 log shahadat ke liye hi jate hai
 That is his feeling
 'bhim singh ne ulte reporter se hi sawaal kar daalaa, 'aap kyon nahin gaye naagarik ke taur par

 JDU general secretary KC Tyagi said, 'nitish Kumar is hurt by this statement

 The indifference of state ministers did not end here
 guuruuvaar subah chhapra main shahid jawan premnath singh or raghunandan ke antim sanskaar main bhi rajya kaa koi mantri nahin pahunchaa
 The Center had also shown that the point of unhappiness was that not a single minister who took the vows in honor of the martyrs reached the airport to pay tribute to the soldiers

 is duniya main har tarah ke tathy maujuud hai
 The survival of those facts depends not on their importance but on how esoteric they are

 Look at the data, it will become easier to understand the facts

 The result: Pax was Romana then, today is Pax Americana
 to saar kya he? vah yah ki duniya bhale badal gai ho, satta ke sukh apni jagah kaayam hai
 If America's emergence coincided with the victory of the First World War, its domination began after the Second World War and if it dominated after the Third War or, say, the Cold War, then the contradictions we face today are also rooted in those liberals There are hidden in the thoughts that America aired with the intention that with their support the future will be captured

 The proposition behind it was like this: All nations will be equal; Post-colonial nations will be formed on the basis of mandate and all political claims will be settled by referendum; The basic principles of democracy will rule in all parts of the world

 The weak vein of democracy is that it gives the right to equality in principle, but does not guarantee it in practice
 har vot kii ahmiyat baraabar hoti he, lekin har voter baraabar nahin hota
 The same formula runs from the biggest to the smallest - money creates power while power and wealth grow
 bharat jaise desh main kisi bhi kism ke adarshavaad yaa bauddhikta kaa sahaara is tathy ko pusht nahin kar saktaa ki yahaan loktantr or badhati garibi ek saath kaise maujuud hai
 Poverty is however absolute and relative
 masalan, america ke garib duniya ke tamaam hisson ke madhyavarg se kahin zyada sampann hai
 Likewise, no child is malnourished in Greece, yet the anger of the Greek people has taken the form of widespread crisis
 duniya bhar main jo sangharsh ho rahe hai, sab asamanta ke khilaaf lade ja rahe hai
 This inequality is seen as unfair
 loktantr samaajwaad kii tarah nahin he ki aarthik samanta kii guarantee thama de, yah naammumkin he
 Yes, at the level of sentiment, she is an advocate of economic equality
 isiilie jab sabase amir paanch fisadi logon or sabase garib 50 fisadi logon ke bich kaa antar ashleel dikhne lagata he, to aap vanchiton se hameshaa khamosh rahane kii apeksha nahin kar sakate
 The power always blames the victim, but in democracy, the oppressed are allowed to raise their voice
 unani janata darasal yahi kar rahi he
 Europe and America have run for help after hearing his screams
 gaye hai to thik hi he, unki marji!lekin yunaan kii aabaadi kaa pachaas guna jis bharat main garibi rekha ke neeche guzar kar rahaa ho, vah ek aisi samasya ke liye 10 arab dollar daan kar de jo uski paidaa na kii hui ho, ajeeb baat he
 Until two decades ago, rich countries considered it their moral obligation to provide financial help to poor countries to overcome poverty
 ab maamla ulat gaya he, ve khud garibon se daan kii ummid karne lage hai
 See the miracle that this is happening
 dilli ke paas bengal ke liye 20,000 karod ru
 No, but Greece gets 56,000 crore rupees

 Even the poor of Bengal can raise their voice like the people of Greece? However, will this money ever come back? Let's look into history: After the second world war, Greece is still waiting to receive the damages from Germany

 In view of the Supreme Court declaring the triple talaq as unconstitutional and illegal, the All India Muslim Personal Law Board has decided that at the time of nikah, it will be agreed between the bride and groom through the kajis and religious leaders that the relationship ends In no case will divorce-e-biddat be resorted to
 darasal 22 agast ko desh kii sheersh adaalat ne ek baar mentin talaak (talaak-e-biddat)ko gaiyrkanoonee or asanvaidhanik qaraar diya tha
 The board's national executive meeting was held in Bhopal yesterday in which the board made it clear that it respected the court's decision and would launch a massive campaign to spread awareness against triple talaq and Sharia
 board ne is sandarbh main ek samiti ke gathan kaa bhi faisla kiya he
 In this meeting of the Board of Personal Law, some other decisions were taken, in which it is important not to say no to three divorces at the same time of marriage
 board ke ek sheersh padaadhikari ne aaj bhashaa ko bataaya, behatar hoga ki nikaah ke samay hi ladkaa or ladki ke pariwaron main yah sahmati ban jaae ki agar rishte khatm karne kii koi sthiti paidaa hoti he to iske liye talaak-e-biddat kaa istemaal nahin kiya jayega
 This will also be included in the awareness campaign
 supreme court ne talaak ke is tareeke ko gaiyrkanoonee qaraar diya he, aise main yah talaak ab maanya nahin hoga
 It is better that people do not execute this divorce
 isamen kaajiyon or dharmaguruon kii bhi madad lee jaaegi
 Divorce-e-biddat has been a practice in the Hanafi sect of Sunni Muslims

 ford ne bataaya ki adhyayan main paaya gaya ki yah ek bhram he ki padhe-likhe bhartiya 'sabhy' tareeke se gaadi chalaate hai, kyonki surveykshan ke dauraan 51 fisadi pratibhaagiyon ko yah pataa nahin tha ki seat belt lagaana suraksha ke liye behad jaruri he
 Seat belts and air bags play the most important role in the safety of the driver and passengers
 adhyayan main paaya gaya ki jinke chote bachche hote hai, ve sadakon par 'sabhy' tareeke se vaahan chalaane kii koshish karte hai, jabaki bachche ke bade hone par ve dhire-dhire laaparvaah ho jate hai

 In Ford's survey, 41 percent said they would not help road accident victims to the hospital, while 40 percent said they would not slow down their car to allow an elderly person to cross the road

 There is news of protests again in Sabarimala
 police kii paabandiyon ke kaaran saikadon gussaye shraddhalu sadakon par utar aae hai
 The incident occurred late Sunday in which devotees of Lord Ayyappa started protesting against the local police and administration in the Sannidhanam area of nadpanthal
 pradarshan main koi hinsak ghatana na ho, iske liye police ne 28 logon ko hiraasat main le liya he
 In view of the previous violent incidents in Sabarimala, the police have imposed many strict restrictions against the devotees in Sannidhanam
 nae prabandh ke mutabik ab shraddhalu raat main sabarimala main nahin ruk paaenge
 The devotees were directed by the police to go out of Sannidhanam on the second day of this worship period lasting two months
 is par shraddhalu bhadak gaye or mandir ke baahar ahatemen jamaa ho gaye
 While explaining about the entire incident, SP Pritish Kumar of Sabarimala said, “section 144 has been implemented in the entire area
 harivarshnam ke baad police ne logon se baahar jane ko kaha lekin adhikansh logon ne iskaa virodh kiya
 'section 144 or prohibitory orders prohibit the gathering of more than four people at one place
 espi ne kaha ki police ne shraddhaluon ko mandir main puja karne se kabhi manaa nahin kiya
 SP Pratish Kumar said, 'those who have to perform Neyabhishekam (consecration of Lord Ayyappa with ghee) can stop at Sabarimala
 shraddhalu puja bhi kar sakate hai
 We are not against it but the police will help those who came for worship
 'virodh pradarshan karne vaale logon ko hiraasat main lekar police pamba thane pahunchi

 5 kilometre dur he
 Sources say that police have received intelligence that some protesters may incite violence in the Sabarimala temple
 isliye police ne ehtiyaat baratate hue shraddhaluon ko hiraasat main lenaa shuru kiya he
 The protesters also have their own different opinion about the protest
 sannidhaanam pahunch ek shraddhalu rajesh ne kaha, 'ham log bhagwaan ayappa ke bhakt hai lekin police ne hamen puja karne se manaa kar diya
 Stating that Section 144 (prohibition) is applicable in the entire area
 ' rajesh ne kaha ki puja ke naam par giraftaar hone main ve koi buraai nahin dekhte or mandir main puja karenge

 Somebody jokingly say what Kohli eats for breakfast, a veteran like Shoaib Akhtar has described him as a great new run machine, predicting his centuries and saying that the Indian captain will score 120 centuries in his career
 The trajectory of Virat Kohli's career ODI runs in this graphic (built by @usmaanalii) illustrate how fast he is scoring relative to other 10,000 run players
 If he scores at his current rate he will pass Sachin Tendulkar's runs in 79 fewer innings than it took Tendulkar

 On Modi's obstruction of India's membership of the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), Prime Minister Modi said that this is the first time we are talking eye to eye
 ek intervyuu main unhone kaha ki china ke saath bharat kii kai samasyaayein chal rahi hai
 Special points of PM Modi's interview
 
 
 1
 On foreign policy, PM Modi said, for the last 30 years there have been unstable governments in our country
 desh kii janata ne hamen bahumat diya, iskaa asar duniya ke nazariye par hota he
 2
 duniya desh ke mukhiya ko jaananaa chaahati he
 But nobody knew Modi
 isliye bataur piem mujhe pro-active hona padaa
 3
 ab duniya dwidhruviya nahin rahi, aaj duniya aapas main judi hui he or sabhi desh ek-duusare par nirbhar hai
 4
 ek vakt tha jab ham samandar ke kinare baithkar lehren gina karte the, lekin ab vakt aa gaya he ki ham patavaar lekar khud utren or disha or gati tay karen
 5
 chinake mudde par piem modi ne kaha, aisa pehali baar hua jab ham aankh se aankh milakar baat kar rahe hai
 India is having many problems with China
 donon deshon ke bich vaicharik bhinnata swaabhaavik he
 6
 pakistan main kai takatein kaam kar rahi hai
 Talks are on with our government there
 ham dosti chaahate hai lekin apane hiton par samjhauta nahin karenge
 7
 pakistanke maamle main hamen har pal chaukanna rahanaa padegaa
 i go to Lahore, call Pakistan PM to India
 
 
 
 The world has appreciated this role of ours
 ham shanti chaahate hai
 8
 seemaa par aatankiyon ko jawaab dene ke liye javaanon ko puri chhot he
 Our soldiers are alive on the border
 hamaara supreme uddeshy shanti or hiton kii raksha karnaa he
 We have told our jawans that they want to answer in the language like Pak, they should answer it in the same way
 9
 On the issue of terrorism, Pakistan is having difficulty in responding, this whole world is watching
 10
 The decision of Laxman Rekha with Pakistan will change with governments, so India will have to be vigilant at every moment
 11
 The government in the country has come under criticism for being more successful in the NSGK case
 12
 i appeal to the media to stop seeing everything in India in the context of Pakistan
 13
 Under our rule, the poor will become stronger now
 ab wo utana taqatvar banegaa, jitne main wo garibi ko parrast kar sake
 14
 hamaari sari yojanaayen desh ke garibon ko majboot banane kii he
 The more people you employ, the more you will benefit
 15
 Do not look at inflation with perception
 ye reality he
 Truth has to be accepted
 pichhali sarkaar main jitani teji se mahangaai bad rahi thi, uske mukaable is baar kam he
 Inflation is rising due to two years of drought
 16
 The government is trying its best to control the prices of pulses

 Laughter and jokes have disappeared from Parliament, this is a matter of concern
 loksabhaa main vipaksh ke netaa kii jimmedaari lene se rahul gandhi ke inkaar ke peeche tark yah diya ja rahaa he ki itani badi haar ke baad vipaksh kaa netaa bananaa unke liye thik nahin hoga
 People are asking that if this argument of the Congress is strong, then how far it is appropriate for Rahul to remain the party vice-president
 sadan main vipaksh ke nae netaa mallikarjun khadge karnataka se aate hai
 He has also been the Railway Minister
 panchayat ho yaa vidhansabha yaa phir loksabhaa, jivan main unhone koi chunaav nahin haara he
 Hindi is also known, Urdu and English too, but Congress leaders do not understand how successful 71-year-old Kharge will be in front of Narendra Modi in the Lok Sabha
 yadi khadge hai, to kamalnath kyon nahin, kamalnath hai to captain amarinder singh kyon nahin, yaa phir rahul hi kyon nahin
 
 
 This is a matter of discussion in Congress
 jaipur ke chintan shivi main rahul gandhi ne kaha tha ki satta jehar ke baraabar he
 
 
 'power is Poison'


 Is this why Rahul is running away from responsibilities
 sawaal yah bhi nahin he ki vipaksh kaa netaa uttar bharat se ho yaa dakshin se, uskaa jujharu hona jaruri he
 Rahul avoided going to Manmohan Singh's cabinet saying that the party had to be strengthened and that could not happen
 sarkaar main kaam karne kaa anubhav bhi nahin hua
 Congress mps are asking questions whether it is not good that Rahul would become the Leader of the Opposition, sit on the bench next to the Lok Sabha and question the government
 yaad kiijie upie par sushamaa swaraj ke hamale
 Instead of learning to make some mistakes, there are also questions on the way to avoid responsibility with an excuse
 log ab yah bhi sawaal khadey kar rahe hai ki yuva netritv dene ke bajaae congress 71 saal ke khadge kii sharan main kyon gai


 narendra modi ke aabhamandal or is bahumat se ladane kaa ek mauka rahul gandhi ne kho diya he
 The problem with the Congress is that when the morale of mps needs to be raised and when the party is looking towards the Gandhi family, Rahul is thinking something else
 logon ke man main yah bhi sawaal he ki kya congress kaa adhyaksh gandhi parivaar ke alaava koi or nahin ho saktaa? kya gandhi parivaar yah jokhim lene ke liye taiyaar hoga? yadi bijepi main bangaroo se lekar gadakari tak baari-baari se adhyaksh ban sakate hai, to congress main kyon nahin? In such a situation, continuous questions are being raised as to whether the Congress high command has any forward road map or not
 yuva sanghathanon main chunaav karaane ke prayog kaa khub dhindhora peeta gaya, lekin jis cheez ko rokane ke liye yah kiya gaya tha, vahi ho gaya
 Most of the sons of the elder father came to win the place and there were many allegations of buying votes
 chunaav ke baad jo maahaul bana, usase koi team nahin ban pai or nateeja saamne he
 Does the Congress high command not know that the state in which the Congress has not come to power twice has ended in that state
 mamata banerjee congress chhodkar alag party banaati hai or satta main aati hai
 The reason is clear that she continued to fight on the ground
 magar congress vahaan khatm ho gai
 If you merge UP, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Bengal, Orissa, there are 225 seats here
 jo congress ke halaat hai, sab jaanate hai
 
 aisa nahin he ki congress ke paas vot nahin hai, use bijepi ke 31 fisadi ke mukaable 19 fisadi vot mili hai
 In such a situation, there is a challenge in front of Rahul to get into the field by becoming a courageous commander, or else free up space for someone else, even if it is Priyanka
 yadi satta jehar he, to kisi na kisi ko congress main yah jehar pine ke liye taiyaar hona padegaa, yadi party ne apane kaaryakartaaon main bharosa nahin jagaaya, to vahi hoga jo har haar ke baad hota he
 
 
 The party starts to disintegrate
 
 
 satta kaa tyaag us vakt acha lagata he, jab aapke paas satta ho, jaisaa ki sonia gandhi ne 2004 main kiya tha
 Why run away from responsibility when there are days to struggle
 rahul ji
 
 
 Along with the advisors, there is a need to change the thinking and also to revive the party
 vah tabhi sambhav hoga, jab aap patibaddhtata dikhaaenge
 Rahul, you don't have to become Manmohan Singh for the Congress
 apni daadi ko yaad kiijie, belchhi kii ghatana ko jaaniye or taiyaar kiijie party ko ek nai ladaai ke liye
 Just have to wait for a chance and do not get opportunities in life again and again
 kavitaaon se bhartiya samaaj kaa rishta purana he
 If it is the matter of such poets who have made the people aware of their rights with their writing from the freedom struggle till then, then the name Ramdhari Singh Dinkar definitely comes up
 aaj rashtrakavi ramdhaari singh dinakar kii 110 veen jayanti he
 Dinkar was born on 23 September 1908 in the village of Simaria in Kebegusarajile, Bihar
 teen saal kii umr main sir se pita kaa saaya uth jane ke kaaran unka bachapan abhaavon main beetaa
 But the daily recitation of Ramacharitmanas at home sowed the seeds of poetry and his understanding within Dinkar
 rashtrakavi ramdhaari singh ‘dinakar’ ne hindi sahitya main na sirf vir ras ke kavy ko ek nai oonchai di, balki apni rachanaaon ke madhyam se rashtriya chetana kaa bhi srijan kiya
 One example of this is the era of complete revolution in the 70s
 dilli ke ramlila maidan main lokanayak jaiprakash narayan ne hajaaron logon ke samaksh dinakar kii pankti ‘singhaasana khaali karo ki janata aati he’ kaa udghosh karke tatkaaleen sarkaar ke khilaaf vidroh kaa shankhanaad kiya tha
 Dinkar's first composition is considered 'pranabhang'
 ise unhone 1928 main likhaa tha
 After this, Dinkar wrote 'renuka', 'hunkar', 'kurukshetra', 'bapu', 'rashmirathi'
 'renuka' or 'hunkaar' main deshbhakti kii bhaavana is kadar bhari hui thi ki ghabaraakar angrejon ne in kitabon par pratibandh laga diya tha
 Dinkar boldly wrote against the British, but did not hesitate to reveal the post-independence power character as well
 dinakar jawahar laal nehru ke prashansakon main se the
 But he did not miss criticism of Nehru on the issue of the death of soldiers in the 1962 war
 'parashuram kii pratiksha' main vah likhte hai,ghaatak he, jo devtaa-sadrush dikhataa he,lekin, kamare main galat hukum likhata he,jis paapi ko gun nahin; gotra pyaara he,samajho, usne hi hamen yahaan maaraa he
 Dinkar's first poetry collection 'vijay Sandesh' was published in the year 1928
 iske baad unhone kai rachanaaen kii
 Some of his major compositions are 'parashurama Ki Pratiksha', 'hunkar' and 'urvashi'
 unhen varsh 1959 main sahitya academy puraskaar se nawaja gaya
 Dinkar, who was awarded the Padma Bhushan, was also a member of the Rajya Sabha
 varsh 1972 main unhen gyanpith sammaan bhi diya gaya
 He died on 24 April 1974
 dinakar ne apni zyaadaatar rachanaaen ‘vir ras’ main kin
 Janmejaya says about this, 'after Bhushan, Dinkar was the only poet who used Veer Ras a lot
 vah ek aisa daur tha, jab logon ke bheetar rashtrabhakti kii bhaavana joro par thi
 Dinkar carried the same sentiment through his poetry
 vah janakavi the isiilie unhen rashtrakavi bhi kaha gaya
 'dinkar also contributed to the freedom struggle of the country
 vah baapu ke bade mureed the
 The great names of Hindi literature, Dinkar were also knowledgeable in Urdu, Sanskrit, Maithili and English languages
 varsh 1999 main unke naam se bharat sarkaar ne dak tikat jari kiya
 Let me tell you, Dinkar worked to make Hindi poetry free from the heaviness of Chhayavism and make it available among the general public
 yahi vajah he ki aaj bhi dinakar kii kavita logon kii jubaan par rahati he
 Some poems by Rashtrakavi Ramdhari Singh Dinkar

 Since the Congress government came to power in Rajasthan, the process of changing the names of government schemes is going on continuously
 khaskar un yojanaon ke naam badale ja rahaa hai jinke naam jansangh ke sansthaapak dinadayal upaadhyaay ke naam par hai
 Gehlot Sircar has removed the name of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya from the Deendayal Upadhyaya Senior Citizen Pilgrimage Scheme
 is tarah se is yojana kaa naam ek baar phir se mukhyamantri varisht naagarik tirth yojana kar diya gaya he
 The Congress argues that Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot introduced the scheme in his last term
 us samay is yojana kaa naam 'mukhyamantri varisht naagarik tirth yojana' tha, lekin 2013 main vasundhara raaje ke netritv main bijepi sarkaar ne satta main aane ke baad is yojana ke naam ke aage pandit dinadayal upaadhyaay kaa naam laga diya tha
 In such a situation, this scheme was of the Congress government, which is being started from its original name
 dilachasp baat ye he ki isse pehle gahalot sarkaar ne jameenon ke patton ke upar se dinadayal upaadhyaay kaa logo hataaya gaya tha
 Apart from this, in the first meeting of the cabinet, the Gehlot government had decided that Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay's logo would not be printed on any government letter pad
 vahiin, bijepi sarkaar ne apane kaarykaal main dinadayal upaadhyaay janm shatabdi manaane ke kaa aadesh jari kiya tha
 In view of this, the order to place the logo of Pandit Deendayal along with the Ashoka Pillar was issued in all kinds of government correspondence in the state
 congress sarkaar ke samaaj kalyaan mantri master bhanvaralaal meghavaal kaa kahana he ki congress sarkaar jaanboojhkar kisi bhi sarkaar kii yojana kaa naam kaa parivartan nahin karti he lekin agar bijepi sarkaar ne durbhaavna koi kaam kiya he to congress sarkaar use thik kar rahi he
 At the same time, BJP MLA Ashok Lahoti said that while the Congress was in opposition, it used to accuse the BJP that it does nothing except change the name
 pradesh kii satta main congress jab se ai he keval naam parivartan karne kaa kaam hi kiya ja rahaa he
 Political drama continues in Karnataka
 sattadhari congress- janata dal secular (jedies) or baagi vidhayakon ke bich sarkaar bachaane, sarkaar giraane kii rassakasi chal rahi he
 The discussion has started with the question of when the drama of Karnataka, which has been going on for many days, will end, whether the government will fall in the budget session? Congress rebelled to save its coalition government of the state and resigned from the membership of the assembly Is trying very hard to convince the rebels, then the rebel mlas are adamant about not withdrawing resignation under any circumstances
 istipha manjuur karne ke liye dabaav bana rahe vidhayakon se vidhansabha adhyaksh ramesh kumaar ne istife kaa kaaran likhit main dene or yah bhi likhakar dene ko kaha he ki vah swechha se istipha de rahe hai
 The legislators, amidst all this, on Thursday appealed to the Supreme Court to order the assembly speaker to take a decision on the resignation, while the speaker of the assembly also asked not to give any order in the court regarding the decision on the resignation
 ab shuukravaar ko adaalat kaa nirnay jo bhi ho, bengalore se mumbai tak siyaasi tapish kam hone ke asaar nahin najar aa rahe
 This is also the reason
 sarkaar par bahumat sabit karne kaa dabaav banane main juty bhaajapashuukravaar se vidhansabha kaa monsoon satr bhi shuru ho rahaa he
 Sensing the opportunity, the congress-jd (S) coalition was forced to leave power in a disastrous majority in the House despite emerging as the single largest party and winning 105 seats in the assembly elections
 Has started making pressure to do
 duusari taraf aisi khabaren bhi aa rahi hai ki bhaajapa ne bhi kumaraswami ko mukhyamantri pad ofer kiya he
 However, the political experts dismiss this and say that if the resignation of the mlas is approved, then the BJP alone can form the government
 vahiin congress ne bhaajapa ko gherne ke liye sansad main dharna diya
 The Congress is trying to disqualify the rebels in the event of a rebellion as well as otherwise
 sadan main voting se pehle istife par faisla praathamiktisi satr main pradesh sarkaar ko bajet bhi pesh karnaa he
 In such a situation, the crisis has deepened due to the loss of loved ones for the Kumaraswamy government, which is facing strong siege of BJP
 bhaajapa ne rajyapal se mulaakaat kar bahumat sabit karne kaa nirdesh dene kii maang kii he
 According to the experts of politics, the BJP can only vote in the Legislative Assembly during the presentation of the budget
 aisa hua to bajet paas hoga nahin
 In such a situation the government may fall
 phoonk-phoonk kar kadam rakh rahi bhaajapajankaron kii maane to bhaajapa is baar kisi bhi tarah kaa risk nahin lenaa chaahati
 That is why the party has launched a campaign against the Kumaraswamy government, but it is stepping up
 party baagi vidhayakon kaa istipha manjuur hone kaa intjaar kar rahi he
 After the resignation is approved, there will be 209 members in the 225-member assembly
 aise main 105 vidhayakon vaali party is ankaganit ke anusaar purna bahumat ke jaadui aankade ko chhu legi
 In such a situation, it is believed that as a strategy, the BJP, which is overthrown by this whole development, is slowly meeting the Governor, etc
 to create an atmosphere
 vahiin duusari taraf istipha dene vaale vidhayak apana istipha manjuur karaane ke prayaas main supreme court kii sharan main pahunch gaye hai
 Whatever the decision, from the Supreme Court to the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly, the political heat in Karnataka does not seem to be decreasing amid the monsoon rains
 saare sawaalon kaa jawaab aane vaala vakt degaa, lekin vartmaan siyaasi ghatnakram kumaraswami sarkaar kii vidaai kii ore hi sanket kar rahaa he

 In his State of Union address, US President Barack Obama emphasized that there is a need to create employment in the country
 unhone rojgaar ke srujankartaaon ko protsaahan dene or aisa na karne par tex thopane kaa prastaav kiya
 While the President's focus was on employment generation and China this time, the impact of any such proposed move on India once again came under discussion
 wais-aadhaarit bipio gatividhi ke pasandida lokation ke rup main philippine ke ubharne ke bare main aane vaali khabaron se is bahes ne jor pakad liya he ki kya outsorcing kaa kaarobaar bharat se chalaa jayega
 It is time to look back and consider how the basic business of outsourcing, which began with the hiring of low-cost talent, has become a fairly global supply chain today
 varshon pehle, companiyaan apni khud kii baari-bharkam ity timen banaati thim
 When the workload increased, it was outsourced to domestic companies
 san 2000 ke baad companiyon ne duusare deshon kii fermon ko kaam kii outsorcing shuru kar di
 The reason for this was that the trust in foreign model froze and India emerged as a reliable country
 bahurashtriya companiyon ne bhartiya companiyon ke bheetar deveopment centre sthapit kiye jisase videshi model viksit hua
 Indian companies were fully devoted to those centers
 contract karmchaariyon kii sankhya or kaam ke ghante par aadhaarit the
 In this way, it became easier for customers to monitor their projects and ensure quality and safety
 lekin aaj outsorcing janasankhyikee, arthshaastra, teji se badalte technological infrastracchar, aapas main jude hue upabhokta or ubhartee hui arthvyavastha se prerit he
 Due to changes in technology and new connected consumers, the buyer is no longer the chief information officer
 ab bijness ikaiyaan tay karne lagi hai ki unhen kis aplication kii jarurat he, chif finantial officer (siefo) bijness ke prabhaav kaa akalan karne lage hai or technology se sambandhit kai faisle board str par kiye ja rahe hai kyonki iskaa prabhaav samooche sanghathan par padataa he
 Specialization has now become a priority
 companiyaan apni khoobiyon par focus karnaa chaahati hai
 They are encouraging partners to manufacture products
 apane kaarobaar ke kayapalat ke liye nae tareeke dhundh rahi hai
 According to a recent Duke University survey, outsourcing has increased organizational flexibility for businesses
 outsorcing companiyon ne apni saakh badhaane ke liye customer domen or plateform par dhyaan kendrit kiya he or apni sarvice delivery kshamta main vruddhi kii he
 Outsourcing has also expanded its field creating new opportunities
 is sector main ity sarvice, bipio, ejineering sarvice or product dizin ke alaava legal sarvice, architekchar dizin, medical diagnosticks or abhi haal main home tution bhi jud gaye hai
 This market has expanded not only into existing businesses and services, but also through new research
 lekin kahani abhi khatm nahin hui he
 Companies are benefiting a lot from the use of their centers or any service provider in India due to fast delivery of products in emerging markets, traffic facilities, round-the-clock support and social media integration
 bharat main nirmit utpaadon main itani kshamta he ki ve kai ubharate bazaaron main chaa sakate hai
 They are creating new income opportunities for companies
 paraspar judi is duniya main yah mahasoos kiya ja rahaa he ki kisi ek desh se sab kuch nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Language, skills, proximity to the customer, business continuity and local market opportunity have created global delivery mechanisms worldwide
 bhartiya companiyaan graahakon kii suvidha ke liye 70 deshon main apane hub bana rahi hai
 The globalization of Indian companies can be gauged from this expansion, merger, acquisition and employment of local people
 bharat ke bheetar, companiyaan kam laagat vaala gramin bipio model apana rahi hai
 Tier 2 cities operate at a level above that and metropolitan centers focus on value addition
 outsorcing sector ke bijness model bhi badal gaye hai
 Earlier the contract was done on an hourly cost basis, but now it depends on the income from the business
 kai maamalon main keemat kaa nirdhaaran upyogita model ke aadhaar par hone laga he jiske tahat graahak upbhog ke anusaar bhugtan karte hai
