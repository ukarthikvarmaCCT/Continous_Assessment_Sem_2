 On January 29, Nido was brutally beaten in Lajpat Nagar in Delhi simply because he had yellow stripes made in his hair

 The people of Delhi could not even get information about this incident that the people of Northeast started protesting in front of Rajasthan Paneer Bhandar in Lajpat Nagar
 jald hi sthaneey sikh log bhi unase jud gaye
 Due to this pressure, leaders like Narendra Modi to Rahul Gandhi and Arvind Kejriwal had to pay attention to the incident of Nido's tragic death
 dilli hycourt ne bhi media reporton ke aadhaar par is ghatana kaa sangyaan liya
 This incident has raised a burning question for the rights of the Northeast in a country where the people of Seven Sisters (seven States of the Northeast) have always been neglected and discriminated against for a long time
 nido kii maut se teen maheene pehle isi lajpat nagar ilaake main bike savaar ne arunachal pradesh ke purv saansad om apang par hamalaa kiya tha
 Apang says, "he called me Chinky, grabbed me by the collar and pulled the key off my car
" sirf isliye ki maine apni car uski bike se aage nikaal lee thi
 "on the same day in Mumbai, someone was narrating similar objections with him

 This is followed by Bangalore, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Chandigarh, Pune and Hyderabad, where the number of people from the Northeast has increased rapidly

 Earlier these people were rarely seen in these cities

 Gaurmangi Singh, a 28-year-old footballer from Manipur and a member of the national team, believes that this situation will change as the distances in various regions between the Northeast and the rest of the country end

 Some of these have created some artwork specifically for India Today, which will be seen further

 One day, in the crowded marketplace of Delhi's Sarojini Nagar, he was surprised when the bike rider from behind started playing loud horns
 tabhi kisi ne jor se aawaaj lagaai, ‘‘oe chinki, hato yaar!’’ usne peeche mudakar nahin dekha or turant ek ore hatakar use rasta de diya
 This place has made him submissive
 ab use fabtiyaan sunne kii aadat pad chuki thi
 Even small children used to tease him on the way by saying "ching Chang"
 uske liye yah sab bilkul nayaa tha
 Although he used to get angry on all these things every time, but like every other thing here, he had to face it too

 It is not government property

 During this, Mukul Roy also said that who got the contract for these promotional materials of Trinamool Congress? He said that its contract was also given to Abhishek Banerjee

 It is known that after Mukul Roy joined BJP, questions were arising that why did Mamata Banerjee and Mukul Roy part ways? It is believed that the relationship between Mamta and Mukul Roy deteriorated after the Sharda chit fund case

 The MP and the minister had to go to jail

 According to sources, RJD chief Lalu Yadav called Chief Minister Nitish Kumar last night in connection with putting an end to the rhetoric released in the alliance
 itnaa hi nahin, lalu ne apni party ke ek pravaktaa ashok sinha ko pad se hataae jane kii bhi soochna di
 He also requested to end the war war that has been going on for the last one week
 haalanki, jediu pravaktaa ke ek taaja bayaan se mahagathbandhan main raar phir se bad gai hai
 JDU leader and Rajya Sabha MP KC Tyagi has hinted at breaking the alliance with RJD
 unhone kaha ki jab bijepi se gathbandhan tha to unki party kaaphi sahaj thi
 During the Chief Minister Nitish Kumar's breakfast invitation on Tuesday morning, the view changed a bit
 haalanki mahagathbandhan main shaamil party congress abhi bhi hamalavar rukh apanaae hue he
 In fact, on Monday, Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad retaliated against Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, who was supporting NDA candidate Ramnath Kovind, and said that the first decision was taken by Nitish Kumar on the defeat of 'bihar's daughter'
 unhone kaha tha ki jo log ek siddhant main yakeen karte hai wo ek faisla lete hai or jo log kai siddhanton main bharosa rakhet hai wo alag-alag faisle lete hai
 However, on Azad's statement, the JDU spokesperson said that we are not part of the UPA
 unhone yah bhi yaad dilaayaa ki bihar main chunaav se pehle gathbandhan karte samay hi tay ho gaya tha ki rashtriya raajnneeti main yah dharna sweekaar nahin hogi
 Actually, the whole controversy started after the announcement of the name of the presidential candidate Meira Kumar for the post of President, when Nitish Kumar refused to change his decision and raised questions on this selection itself saying that 'bihar Why was the daughter of 'chosen' to lose
 haalanki iske baad argedy adhyaksh ne apni ore se nitish kaa faisla badalane kii bharpoor koshish kii
 During the Iftar party, the two leaders also held talks, but Nitish kept saying that if this is a historical mistake, then let it be done
 tippaniyan The matter did not stop here, on the lines of PM Modi's radio program 'mann Ki Baat', Bihar Deputy CM Tejashwi Yadav has started 'dil Ki Baat' and on Sunday, Tejashwi took the name of Bihar CM Nitish Kumar without any name
 He called him autistic and opportunistic
 tejasvi ne kaha, 'aatmakendrit vyavhaar kii vajah se vipaksh bhramit or thodaa bikharaa hua dikh rahaa he
 Opportunistic behavior and political manipulation may lead to immediate benefits or a government collapse, but unlike television anchors, history will testify that when progressive politics needed to be strengthened, we chose another route
 ' Tejashwi's hidden attack on the CM of the state went through the JDU and after this, Bihar unit president Vashistha Narayan Singh questioned the future of the grand alliance
 unhone kaha ki ab sarkaar main shaamil log aise bayaan jari kar rahe hai to ye khatre kii ghanti bajane jaisaa he
 He did not expect such a statement from the deputy CM
 mangalvaar subah mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ke naashte ke aamantran ke dauraan najaara kuch badla sa laga

 He said that people who believe in one principle take a decision and those who believe in many principles take different decisions
 haalanki aaazaad ke bayaan par jediu pravaktaa ne kaha tha ki ham upie kaa hissaa nahin hai
 He also reminded that before the elections in Bihar, it was decided at the time of alliance that this notion would not be accepted in national politics
 darasal is puure vivaad kii shuruyaat raashtrapati pad ke liye vipaksh kii ummidavaar mira kumaar ke naam kii ghoshnaa ke baad se shuru hui, jab nitish kumaar ne apana faisla badalane se inkaar karte hue ye is chayan par hi ye kehete hue sawaal uthaae ki aakhir 'bihar kii beti' ko haarane ke liye hi kyon chunaa gaya
 However, after this, the RJD president tried his best to change Nitish's decision

 Tejashwi, considered the younger son of RJD chief Lalu Prasad and his political successor, said, “the Constitution and our democracy are being killed
 ham is kanoon ke khilaaf ant tak ladenge
 He said that Nitish Kumar should be ashamed for betraying the minorities of the state, who despite being an old ally of the BJP, claim to be secular

 Significantly, to win the election to JDS, Owaisi not only supported him but also campaigned in favor of the party
 lekin shapath grahan main wo najar nahin aae kyonki ve pichley kai din se desh se baahar hai
 If Owaisi had been in the country and attended the ceremony, his presence with all the stalwarts of the opposition on the stage would have indicated new political equations

 Asaduddin Owaisi, president of All India majlis-e-ittehadul Muslimeen, surprised everyone by deciding not to contest any of his party's candidates in the Karnataka elections, when earlier he had decided to contest about 35 Muslim-majority seats
 iske liye unhone baqayada ummivaaron kaa chayan bhi kar liya tha
 Owaisi has often been accused of benefiting the BJP
 upi or bihar main unki party ke chunaav ladane par ye baaten kahin gai thi
 It is believed that in view of this, he decided to support the JDS instead of fielding a party candidate in Karnataka
 ovaisi ne jedies ummidavaaron ko jitaane ke liye jamkar prachaar bhi kiya
 Explain that during the Congress election campaign, JDS was telling bjp's b team
 rahul gandhi ne ek jansabha main kaha tha, 'janata dal (es) main 'es' kaa matlab secular nahin balki sangh parivaar he
 However, Rahul Gandhi's statement was seen on the basis of a strategy to save Muslim votes from slipping towards the JDS in political circles

 In India, the world's second most populous country, there is a continuous process of appeals by various religious leaders to produce more children from their communities
 taaja maamle main sikh samudaay ke sheersh dharmaguru ne kaha he ki sikh samudaay ke logon ko kam se kam chaar bachche paidaa karnaa chahie

 He said, it is clear that a house with two children is a smaller vote bank than a house with 10 children
 islamme kam bachche paidaa karne kii bandish nahin he isliye vot bank kii raajnneeti main unka majboot dakhal he
 Justifying his point, Singh said, for the first time, i have not appealed to the Sikhs to have more children
 main aisa pehle bhi kar chukaa hum or lagbhag 99 fisadi log meri baat se sahamat bhi hai
 To prove his point, he also listed the names of all the famous people of the Sikh community who have more than two children

 He said that he would put this suggestion in front of everyone in the Akal Takht meeting

 Former SGPC secretary Manjit Singh condemned Singh's statement, saying, "sikhism does not depend on numbers
" aajkal yun bhi bachche sikh dharm ke reeti-rivaajon kaa kam paalan kar rahe hai, akaal takht itane bacchon ko sikh samudaay ke prati aasakt kaise bana paaenge
 Who will bear the expenses of raising children

 shivaraj ne kaha kicongress ke rashtriya adhyaksh rahul gandhi or mukhyamantri kisaan karjamaafee ko lekar logon ko gumraah kar rahe hai
 What he has said about waiving my relatives is completely wrong
 shivaraj singh ne kaha ki rahul gandhi ne gwalior main karjamaafee vaale kisaanon kii jo suchi dikhaai thi usamen mere bhai rohit chouhan kaa karja maaf hone kii baat kahi gai thi, lekin hakeekat kuch or he
 My brother had not even filled the application for loan waiver
 phir kamalnath ji ne itani krupa kyon kii
 What was the explanation given by Shivraj?

 Shivraj Singh Chauhan further said that the Congress did not forgive the debt of the farmers, rather they sent me the Eye Drop and Chyawanprash so that i can see how many farmers' debt has been forgiven
 sach to yah he ki congress sarkaar kisaanon ko murkh samajhati he or jab tak bank kisaanon ko qarz maafi kaa pramaan patr nahin degaa tab tak qarz maafi nahin maani jaati he
 Shivraj arrived at the press conference with Chyawanprash

 haalanki is ghoshnaa ke peeche ek vajah yah bhi maani ja rahi he ki bijepi ke sheersh netritv ko bhi lagane laga he ki 'modi lahar' kamjor padi he
 Nitish Kumar has certainly got a new political life from this announcement
 is ghoshnaa ke do pahalu hai
 One, the BJP understands the importance of Nitish Kumar and does not want to play any gamble without going to the Lok Sabha elections
 vahiin bihar kii raajnneeti main nitish kumaar naa keval endie ke vidhayakon ke chune netaa hai balki bhaajapa ke sheersh netritv ne bhi ab maan liya he ki unke cheharaa or kaam par hi bihar main endie vot maangegi or aapako pasand he to rahiye yaa nahin
 But everyone wants to know what is the meaning of equal agreement, how it happened and when it happened
 is ghoshnaa kaa ek hi arth he ki filhal pradhanmantri narendra modi, bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah or bihar bhaajapa ke netaaon ko nitish kumaar kaa koi vikalp nahin dikhataa
 He feels that if Nitish Kumar is kept together and goes to the Lok Sabha elections, the number of seats won in the last Lok Sabha election can be repeated once again
 amit shah or narendra modi ne ek baar phir dikhaaya he ki sahyogiyon ko mahatv dena wo bhi jaanate hai or jaise shivasena ke saath sambandh ko saamaanya karne kaa bhaar shah ne kuch maheene purv apane kandhe par liya tha vaise hi bihar ke gathbandhan ko bhi unhone nitish kumaar ke manmutabik siten dekar gathbandhan dharm kaa nirvaahan kiya
 On the other hand, Nitish Kumar has also felt for the first time after forming a government with the BJP that no effort is being made in his honor
 nitish kush hai ki jaise unki raajnneetik aalochana ho rahi thi wo, siton ke is bantwaare ke baad ab wo niraadhaar or kuch logon kii kori kalpana sabit hui
 Nitish once again proved to be a strong leader from this episode, who still has the power to get his voice heard
 ab hoga asli siyaasi dangal? BJP-JDU main 50-50 formule se bihar NDA main much saktaa he 'ghamaasan' So how did this compromise happen? Many reasons account for this
 pehali vajah to yah rahi ki bhaajapa tamaam maathapai kar is nattejey par pahunchi ki filhal nitish ko kinare kar chunaav nahin ladaa ja saktaa
 In this, the role of the ministers of Bihar BJP, especially ministers like Sushil Modi, Nand Kishore Yadav and Prem Kumar, is important, who maintains that going to the elections only with Paswan and Kushwaha can prove suicidal
 doosraa, bhaajapa ne ek se adhik surveykshan karaaye jisamen nitish ke saath jane par parinaam unke manamaafik aa rahe the, vahiin nitish ke bina vaale survey ke parinaam bahut anukool nahin the
 After all, Upendra Kushwaha, who is preparing to go to the court, will 'bargain for seats' with Amit Shah on Monday sabase pehle july maheene main amit shah se nitish kumaar bhojan par patna main mili to unhone ek maheene main siton kaa bantwaaraa puraa karne kaa vaada liya
 But the real conversation started in August with BJP leader Bhupendra Yadav, Janata Dal United MP and Nitish's close RCP Singh and Minister Lalan Singh where the BJP appeared ready to give 15 seats, contrary to media reports
 isse pehle bhaajapa kii taraf se maatr 12 siten dene kii khabar aayi thi jise janata dal ne turant kaarij kar diya tha
 But the real equal formula itself, Nitish proposed after talking to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which modi-shah accepted before 16 September
 isliye pehali baar apni party rajya kaaryakarini ke saamne 16 sitambar ko nitish ne kaha ki siton kaa samjhauta sammanjanak or party ke hit main hua he lekin isaki ghoshnaa uchit samay par BJP ke netaaon ke dwaara kii jaaegi
 Nitish was confident that whenever the seat agreement was announced, it would be based on an equal formula
 lekin is bich bhupendra yadav jinke jimme lok janashakti party ke netaa ramvilas paswan or ralospa ke upendra kushvaha se baatcheet karne kaa zimmaa tha, wo party ke kuch anya kaamon main vyast ho gayi
 But Nitish and Bihar BJP leaders were unanimous that if Upendra Kushwaha wants to go, then his mind should not be a waste of time because the alliance that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Nitish Kumar will have will be made by non-yadav voters especially Kushwaha voters on the other hand
 Will go vishesh rup se mahagathbandhan kii ore jiskaa netritv tejasvi yadav ke haath main hoga, to bilkul hi nahin jaaenge
 But everyone was unanimous towards Paswan that he still has the ability to transfer Paswan voters so if his seats in the Lok Sabha are getting reduced then he should be replenished immediately by sending him to Rajya Sabha from any state
 lekin nitish ke saamne bhaajapa jhuki to uske peeche ye bhi ek factor rahaa ki jahaan dalit or agadi jatiyon main dalit act ko lekar naaraazgi bad rahi thi, lekin nitish ne kam se kam daliton ko kush karne ke liye kamobesh unki adhikansh maangon ko maanakar unke gusse ko thanda karne kii koshish kii
 After that BJP felt that even if Nitish is left, he may have to lose his hands with the Dalit votes
 gauratlab heki nitish kumaar bhaajapa ke saath sarkaar banane ke baad naaraaz chal rahe the or wo kai maukon par dikhaa bhi
 Then whether in front of Prime Minister Modi publicly demanding that his Patna University be declared a Central University or last year after getting fifteen percent of the amount sought for flood relief
 endie main koi tarjeeh nahin die jane se bhi wo niraash the
 By giving them equal seats, Prime Minister Narendra Modi fulfilled a promise that the BJP would respect him in the political share before forming the government in July last year
 tippaniyan VIDEO: Agreement on seats in Bihar NDA nitish ne bhi unhen bharosa dilaayaa tha ki unhen pichley chunaav ke 31 siton se zyaada bihar se milengi
 In the coming few months, Nitish, who has more than 50 percent popularity in his survey against Tejashwi Yadav, will have to convert it into votes
 kyonki bihar main endie ke aadhaar vot ke do majboot stambh agadi jatiyaan bhaajapa or nitish se or dalit bhaajapa se naaraaz or niraash chal rahe hai
 As much as Nitish knows this truth, Sushil Modi too
 isliye endie ko bihar main aaj mahagathbandhan se zyaada chunauti patibaddh puraane votaron kii udaasi se mil rahi he
 At present, equal agreement of seats has once again confirmed that Nitish Kumar will remain in the role of groom in Bihar, even if a party is standing behind in the procession
 is ghoshnaa kaa ek hi arth he ki filhal pradhanmantri narendra modi, bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah or bihar bhaajapa ke netaaon ko nitish kumaar kaa koi vikalp nahin dikhataa

 At present, equal agreement of seats has once again confirmed that Nitish Kumar will remain in the role of groom in Bihar, even if a party is standing behind in the procession
 to akhir ye samjhauta hua kaise? iske peeche kai kaaran hai
 The first reason is that the BJP came to the conclusion that it cannot contest elections by shoring up Nitish
 isamen bihar bhaajapa ke netaaon khaaskar susheel modi, nand kishor yadav or prem kumaar jaise mantri bane baithe netaaon kii bhoomika ahm rahi jo is baat par qaayam rahe ki keval paswan or kushvaha ke sahare chunaav main janaa aatmghaatee sabit ho saktaa he
 Secondly, the BJP conducted more than one survey in which the results were coming to his liking when he went with Nitish, while the results without Nitish were not very favorable
 aakhir kis paale main jane kii taiyaari kar rahe hai upendra kushvaha, somvaar ko amit shah se karenge 'siton kii saudebaaji' First of all, Nitish Kumar met Amit Shah in Patna in the month of July, then he promised to fulfill the seat allocation in one month
 lekin asal baatcheet agast maheene main bhaajapa ke netaa bhoopendra yadav, janata dal united ke saansad or nitish ke qareebi aaaraseepi singh or mantri lalan singh ke saath shuru hui jahaan media report ke vipareet bhaajapa 15 siten dene ke liye taiyaar dikhi
 Earlier there was a news from the BJP to give only 12 seats, which was immediately rejected by the Janata Dal
 lekin asal baraabar-baraabar kaa formula khud nitish ne pradhanmantri narendra modi se baatcheet kar prastaav diya jo modi-shah ne 16 sitambar ke pehle maan bhi liya
 Therefore, on September 16, for the first time in front of his party's state executive, Nitish said that the seat agreement has been done in a respectful and in the interest of the party but it will be announced by BJP leaders at an appropriate time
 nitish aashwast the ki siton ke samjhaute kii ghoshnaa jab bhi hogi baraabar-baraabar ke formule par hi aadhaarit hogi
 But in the meantime, Bhupendra Yadav, who was responsible for talking to Lok Janshakti Party leader Ram Vilas Paswan and rlsp's Upendra Kushwaha, got busy with some other work of the party
 lekin nitish or bihar BJP ke netaa is baat par ekamat the ki agar upendra kushvaha janaa chahen to unke maan manouvval main samay kii barabaadi nahin kii jaae kyonki jis gathbandhan main pradhanmantri narendra modi or nitish kumaar honge use gair yadav voter khaaskar kushvaha voter kabhi duusari ore jaaenge
 Especially towards the grand alliance, which will be headed by Tejashwi Yadav, will not go at all
 lekin paswan ke prati sabhi log ek mat the ki abhi bhi unke paas paswan votaron ko transfar karaane kii kshamta qaayam he isliye agar loksabhaa main unki siten kam ho rahi hon to unhen rajyasabha kisi bhi rajya se bhej kar uski bharpai turant kii jaae
 But the BJP bowed in front of Nitish, and there was a factor behind it that while there was growing anger among Dalits and upper castes about the Dalit Act, Nitish at least gave up most of his demands to please the Dalits and his anger Tried to cool down
 uske baad BJP ko laga ki ab bhi agar nitish ko choda jaae to dalit voton se unhen haath dhonaa pad saktaa he
 Significantly, Nitish Kumar was angry after forming the government with BJP and he also showed it on many occasions
 phir chaahe pradhanmantri modi ke saamne saarvajanik rup se unki patna vishwa vidhyalay ko kendriya vishwa vidhyalay ghoshit karne kii maang ho yaa pichley saal baadh raahat ke liye maangi gayi raashi kaa pandrah pratishat milane ke baad kii naaraazgi
 He was also disappointed with the NDA not being given any preference
 unako baraabar-baraabar seat dekar pradhanmantri narendra modi ne pichley saal july main sarkaar banane ke purv apane ek vaade ko puraa kiya ki raajnneetik hissedari main bhaajapa unka maan sammaan rakhegi
 The comments VIDEO: bihar NDA main siton ko lekar samjhauta Nitish also assured him that he would get more than 31 seats from Bihar in the last election
 aane vaale kuch maheenon main nitish ko, jinke apane survey main tejasvi yadav ke muqaabale lokapriyata 50 pratishat se adhik he, use voton main tabdeel karke dikhaanaa hoga
 Because two strong pillars of the nda's Aadhar vote in Bihar are angry and disappointed with the forward castes BJP and Nitish and the Dalit BJP
 ye sach nitish jitna jaanate hai utana susheel modi bhi
 That is why the NDA is facing a greater challenge than the grand alliance of old voters in Bihar today
 filhal siton ke baraabar-baraabar samjhaute se ek baar phir is baat par muhar lagi he ki bihar main nitish kumaar duulhaa kii bhoomika main hi rahenge, bhale baraat main koi dal peeche khadaa ho
 After all, Upendra Kushwaha, who is preparing to go to the court, will 'bargain for seats' with Amit Shah on Monday sabase pehle july maheene main amit shah se nitish kumaar bhojan par patna main mili to unhone ek maheene main siton kaa bantwaaraa puraa karne kaa vaada liya
 But the real conversation started in August with BJP leader Bhupendra Yadav, Janata Dal United MP and Nitish's close RCP Singh and Minister Lalan Singh where the BJP appeared ready to give 15 seats, contrary to media reports
 isse pehle bhaajapa kii taraf se maatr 12 siten dene kii khabar aayi thi jise janata dal ne turant kaarij kar diya tha
 But the real equal formula itself, Nitish proposed after talking to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which modi-shah accepted before 16 September
 isliye pehali baar apni party rajya kaaryakarini ke saamne 16 sitambar ko nitish ne kaha ki siton kaa samjhauta sammanjanak or party ke hit main hua he lekin isaki ghoshnaa uchit samay par BJP ke netaaon ke dwaara kii jaaegi
 Nitish was confident that whenever the seat agreement was announced, it would be based on an equal formula
 lekin is bich bhupendra yadav jinke jimme lok janashakti party ke netaa ramvilas paswan or ralospa ke upendra kushvaha se baatcheet karne kaa zimmaa tha, wo party ke kuch anya kaamon main vyast ho gayi
 But Nitish and Bihar BJP leaders were unanimous that if Upendra Kushwaha wants to go, then his mind should not be a waste of time because the alliance that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Nitish Kumar will have will be made by non-yadav voters especially Kushwaha voters on the other hand
 Will go vishesh rup se mahagathbandhan kii ore jiskaa netritv tejasvi yadav ke haath main hoga, to bilkul hi nahin jaaenge
 But everyone was unanimous towards Paswan that he still has the ability to transfer Paswan voters so if his seats in the Lok Sabha are getting reduced then he should be replenished immediately by sending him to Rajya Sabha from any state
 lekin nitish ke saamne bhaajapa jhuki to uske peeche ye bhi ek factor rahaa ki jahaan dalit or agadi jatiyon main dalit act ko lekar naaraazgi bad rahi thi, lekin nitish ne kam se kam daliton ko kush karne ke liye kamobesh unki adhikansh maangon ko maanakar unke gusse ko thanda karne kii koshish kii
 After that BJP felt that even if Nitish is left, he may have to lose his hands with the Dalit votes
 gauratlab heki nitish kumaar bhaajapa ke saath sarkaar banane ke baad naaraaz chal rahe the or wo kai maukon par dikhaa bhi
 Then whether in front of Prime Minister Modi publicly demanding that his Patna University be declared a Central University or last year after getting fifteen percent of the amount sought for flood relief
 endie main koi tarjeeh nahin die jane se bhi wo niraash the
 By giving them equal seats, Prime Minister Narendra Modi fulfilled a promise that the BJP would respect him in the political share before forming the government in July last year

 isliye endie ko bihar main aaj mahagathbandhan se zyaada chunauti patibaddh puraane votaron kii udaasi se mil rahi he

 Especially towards the grand alliance, which will be headed by Tejashwi Yadav, will not go at all
 lekin paswan ke prati sabhi log ek mat the ki abhi bhi unke paas paswan votaron ko transfar karaane kii kshamta qaayam he isliye agar loksabhaa main unki siten kam ho rahi hon to unhen rajyasabha kisi bhi rajya se bhej kar uski bharpai turant kii jaae
 But the BJP bowed in front of Nitish, and there was a factor behind it that while there was growing anger among Dalits and upper castes about the Dalit Act, Nitish at least gave up most of his demands to please the Dalits and his anger Tried to cool down
 uske baad BJP ko laga ki ab bhi agar nitish ko choda jaae to dalit voton se unhen haath dhonaa pad saktaa he
 Significantly, Nitish Kumar was angry after forming the government with BJP and he also showed it on many occasions
 phir chaahe pradhanmantri modi ke saamne saarvajanik rup se unki patna vishwa vidhyalay ko kendriya vishwa vidhyalay ghoshit karne kii maang ho yaa pichley saal baadh raahat ke liye maangi gayi raashi kaa pandrah pratishat milane ke baad kii naaraazgi
 He was also disappointed with the NDA not being given any preference
 unako baraabar-baraabar seat dekar pradhanmantri narendra modi ne pichley saal july main sarkaar banane ke purv apane ek vaade ko puraa kiya ki raajnneetik hissedari main bhaajapa unka maan sammaan rakhegi
 The comments VIDEO: bihar NDA main siton ko lekar samjhauta Nitish also assured him that he would get more than 31 seats from Bihar in the last election
 aane vaale kuch maheenon main nitish ko, jinke apane survey main tejasvi yadav ke muqaabale lokapriyata 50 pratishat se adhik he, use voton main tabdeel karke dikhaanaa hoga
 Because two strong pillars of the nda's Aadhar vote in Bihar are angry and disappointed with the forward castes BJP and Nitish and the Dalit BJP
 ye sach nitish jitna jaanate hai utana susheel modi bhi
 That is why the NDA is facing a greater challenge than the grand alliance of old voters in Bihar today
 filhal siton ke baraabar-baraabar samjhaute se ek baar phir is baat par muhar lagi he ki bihar main nitish kumaar duulhaa kii bhoomika main hi rahenge, bhale baraat main koi dal peeche khadaa ho
 But Nitish and Bihar BJP leaders were unanimous that if Upendra Kushwaha wants to go, then his mind should not be a waste of time because the alliance that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Nitish Kumar will have will be made by non-yadav voters especially Kushwaha voters on the other hand
 Will go vishesh rup se mahagathbandhan kii ore jiskaa netritv tejasvi yadav ke haath main hoga, to bilkul hi nahin jaaenge
 But everyone was unanimous towards Paswan that he still has the ability to transfer Paswan voters so if his seats in the Lok Sabha are getting reduced then he should be replenished immediately by sending him to Rajya Sabha from any state
 lekin nitish ke saamne bhaajapa jhuki to uske peeche ye bhi ek factor rahaa ki jahaan dalit or agadi jatiyon main dalit act ko lekar naaraazgi bad rahi thi, lekin nitish ne kam se kam daliton ko kush karne ke liye kamobesh unki adhikansh maangon ko maanakar unke gusse ko thanda karne kii koshish kii
 After that BJP felt that even if Nitish is left, he may have to lose his hands with the Dalit votes
 gauratlab heki nitish kumaar bhaajapa ke saath sarkaar banane ke baad naaraaz chal rahe the or wo kai maukon par dikhaa bhi
 Then whether in front of Prime Minister Modi publicly demanding that his Patna University be declared a Central University or last year after getting fifteen percent of the amount sought for flood relief
 endie main koi tarjeeh nahin die jane se bhi wo niraash the
 By giving them equal seats, Prime Minister Narendra Modi fulfilled a promise that the BJP would respect him in the political share before forming the government in July last year
 tippaniyan VIDEO: Agreement on seats in Bihar and NDA nitish ne bhi unhen bharosa dilaayaa tha ki unhen pichley chunaav ke 31 siton se zyaada bihar se milengi
 In the coming few months, Nitish, who has more than 50 percent popularity in his survey against Tejashwi Yadav, will have to convert it into votes
 kyonki bihar main endie ke aadhaar vot ke do majboot stambh agadi jatiyaan bhaajapa or nitish se or dalit bhaajapa se naaraaz or niraash chal rahe hai
 As much as Nitish knows this truth, Sushil Modi too
 isliye endie ko bihar main aaj mahagathbandhan se zyaada chunauti patibaddh puraane votaron kii udaasi se mil rahi he
 At present, equal agreement of seats has once again confirmed that Nitish Kumar will remain in the role of groom in Bihar, even if a party is standing behind in the procession

 One of the greatest actors of Bollywood, Dilip Kumar's houses are not doing well
 pehle mumbai main unke bhaaiyon ne ghar chhodane ke evaj main moti rakam maangi to ab pakistan main unke pushtaini makaan ko rashtriya dharohar banane ke liye makaan maalik 8 karod rupee maang rahaa he
 Dilip Kumar hails from Peshawar and had his ancestral house there
 us makaan ke maalik akram ulla ne use dharohar banane kii evaj main sarkaar se saade teen karod rupee maange the
 Later his greed increased and he demanded Rs 8 crore
 darasal pakistan ke pradhan mantri navaj sharif ne haal hi main dilip kumaar ke makaan ko rashtriya dharohar ghoshit kiya he
 At its initiative, the provincial government also wanted to make it a heritage and talked to Akram
 us samay usne do karod rupee maange the lekin baad main is raashi ko badhaakar saadhe teen karod rupee kar diya tha
 But now he has increased this amount to Rs 8 crore
 lekin ab sarkaar naaraaz ho gai he
 a Culture Department official said that if Akram did not charge the right price, the government would acquire the house as it has been declared a national heritage
 itnaa hi nahin prantiy sarkaar ko yah adhikaar he ki kisi bhi puraane bhawan ko repering ke liye adhigrahit kar sakati he
 This ancestral house of Dilip Kumar, three storey house is now in dilapidated condition
 dilli se sate haryana ke faridabad main hatya kaa ek sansanikhej maamla saamne aayaa he
 Where a son stabbed his mother with a stick and killed her
 bujurg maa kaa kasoor sirf itnaa tha ki wo apane bete se kharche ke liye kuch paise maang rahi thi
 This incident of killing of relations took place in Bharat Colony of Faridabad
 darasal, 70 varshiya jasoda devi apane do beton ke saath vahaan rahati thi
 Jasoda Devi was demanding a few rupees from her elder son Chhatrapal for her expenses
 lekin chatrapal ne apanimapaise dene se manaa kar diya
 At this, the mother demanded her share in the land from Chhatrapal
 isi baat par maa bete ke bich vivaad hone laga
 The dispute took the form of a quarrel on Wednesday
 isi dauraan chatrapal ne gusse main aakar apni maa ke sir main ek danda se waar kiya
 Due to which she fell to the ground
 ghayal avasthaa main dasoda devi ko civil aspataal le jaaya gaya
 Where the doctors declared him dead
 police ke mutabik aspataal se soochna mili thi ki ek mahila ko mrit avasthaa main laayaa gaya he
 The police went to the hospital and recorded the statement of the deceased's brother
 usne bataaya ki uske bhaanje chatrapal ne khud apni maa ke sir par waar karke uski hatya kii he
 The police registered the case on the basis of the statement

 The Congress cautioned political parties against making low-level allegations amid allegations of tax evasion of Rahul Gandhi in land purchase
 rahul gandhi ke karyaalay ke saude main stamp kar chori ke sabhi aaropon kaa khandan karne ke baad party mahasachiv janardan dvivedi ne kaha ki is sambandh main ek likhit bayaan diya gaya he ‘isaki (mudde kii) koi bhi kisi bhi tareeke se jaanch kar saktaa he

 He said, 'no one has dismissed the investigation

 He said, 'all political parties, especially the big parties, should be vigilant

 As a result, GST, which has been rapidly crossing the deadlock of Parliament, has slowed down
 july agali samay seemaa he jo april se zyada kathin dikhti he
 GST means no other tax, cess (cess) or duty back and forth
 sirf akelaa paardarshee ek yaa do tex daron vaala jiesti
 But after creating the five tax rate GST, the central government started preparing for cess on it
 yah ses kii sanak hi dhalaan kii shuruyaat thi kyonki agar centre sarkaar tex par tex thopane kaa laalach chhodie ko taiyaar nahin he to rajya kyon peeche rahen?nayaa bajet vilambit jiesti kii chaaya main ban rahaa he jo jiesti kii jameen taiyaar karegaa
 Before we move to the new cess and tax, it is necessary to know how complex is the cess market in India
 jo ses hamase vasule gaye hai, unke istemaal par sarkaar kabhi kuch nahin bataati
 Last month, when people were engaged in the lines of banks and Parliament was at a standstill, a report by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) came out which is the latest disclosure of the Central Government's cess-raj
 mobile vaala taxdy bahuton ko yah jaankaree nahin hogi ki mobile oparator gaanvon main phone or internet pahunchane ke liye apane rajasav par ek vishesh tex dete hai
 Which is called the Universal Access Levy
 yah tex hamaare telephone bill par hi lagata he
 The Universal Obligation Fund (USO Fund) has been created for its expenditure

 Raised, with only Rs 39,133 crore
 yuasao fund ko die gaye
 Will the government answer this question if the phone has reached the villages, then why is this levy being collected and if this money is deposited, then why can't it be used to fix the mobile network and stop the call drop? In -07, a special cess of one percent was imposed on the income tax to modernize the level of higher education and secondary education
 2015-16 tak is ses se 64,228 karod ru
 Were mobilized
 sieji bataata he ki iske istemaal ke liye sarkaar ne na to koi fund banaaya or na hi kisi skim ko yah paisa diya
 If there is enough money for education then why the burden on taxpayer? Why does the country not get account of its use? Under primary education, there is also a two per cent primary education cess on income tax to raise money for Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan and mid-day meal, for which primary education dictionary is used
 is kosh ko 2004-2015 ke bich jutai gai puri raashi nahin di gai he

 Between 2010 and 2015, the government raised Rs

 However, in the 2016 budget, the government changed its name to CLE, doubling the rate of cess by making clean environment cess

 The amount of the cess is given by the Technology Development Board
 1996-97 se 2014-15 tak is ses se 5,783 karod ru
 Raised but under the board the fund received Rs 549 crore
 sirf yahi nahindy sadakon ke vikaas ke liye petrol-dijal par lagane vaala road deveopment ses bhi puri tarah road fund ko nahin miltaa
 The cesses imposed by the previous governments were neither low, nor could the failure be cured according to them, but the Modi government gave three new cesses in its three budgets

 The Central Government has made this reform head-on
 ses tex nahin hai
 It is an opaque part of taxation
 inhen lagaaya kisi naam se jaataa he or istemaal kahin or hota he
 States object to this because the cesses remain outside the tax pool in which the states share
 centre sarkaar kaa kul ses sangrah 2015-16 main 55 fisadi badha he

 Service tax of 18 per cent is to be levied under GST
 Consequently, the service tax rate of 1 to 1 in the 2017 budget
 5 fisadi tak bad sakati he yaa phir nae ses lag sakate hai
 Therefore, it would be prudent to prepare yourself for any major setback, hoping for relief in the budget

 Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi on behalf of the BJP in his affidavit filed before the Vadodara Election Commission on Wednesday revealed that he was married and revealed that his wife's name is Jashodaben
 vadodara loksabhaa seat ke liye apane namakan patr ke saath daakhil kiye gaye halafname main modi ne pehali baar khud ke shaadishuda hone kii baat kahi he
 Modi used to leave the column giving information about his wife empty
 modi ne 2012 ke vidhansabha chunaav main yah kollam khaali chhod diya tha
 However, in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Modi wrote in a column announcing the property in his wife's name that he had no idea about it
 vadodara jila chunaav adhikari ne is halafname ko colectoret ke disple board par raat main lagaaya
 Significantly, the Congress had said that Modi should clear his stance on his marital status while filing his nomination papers for the Lok Sabha elections
 modi ne farvari main ek raily main kaha tha, main akelaa hum, main kiske liye bhrasht banuunga
 Congress General Secretary Digvijay Singh tweeted this morning, Modi has accepted his marital status
 kya desh kii mahilaayein aise kisi shaks par bharosa kar sakati hai, jo ek mahila kaa peechha karwaata ho, apni patni ko uske adhikaron se vanchit rakhata ho
 
 
 As the new discussion about Modi's marital status began to gain momentum, his elder brother Sombhai Damodar Modi issued a statement saying that his family had married Modi in his childhood, but Narendra Modi never accepted it And instead he considered the whole country as his family and his responsibility
 sombhai modi ne kaha, jo 45-50 saal pehle hua, use ek garib or andhvishwasi parivaar kii paristhitiyon ke sandarbh main rakhkar dekha janaa chahie
 In a recent interview to a newspaper, Jashodaben also said that he was married to Narendra Modi when she was 17, but the two separated after three years of marriage, and have since separated
 , She never met Narendra Modi
 jashodaben ne bataaya ki ve donon, "achche maahaul main ek-duusare se alag hue the
 
 
 There were never any quarrels
 
 
 vaise, teen saal ke dauraan ham shaayad kul milakar teen maheene hi ek saath rahe the
 " 62-varshiya jashodaben ne is saakshaatkaar main yah bhi kaha tha ki unhen 'bura mahasoos' nahin hota ki narendra modi ne kabhi patni ke rup main unhen sweekaar nahin kiya, lekin vah saath hi yah bhi kahati hai, "main jaanati hum ki vah (narendra modi) aisa isliye kar rahe hai, kyonki yahi meraa bhagya he, or vakt bura chal rahaa he
 
 
 When circumstances are like this, they (narendra Modi) have to say such things as well, and also have to lie
 " haalanki unhone puri ummid jataai thi ki narendra modi ek din pradhanmantri jarur banenge
 According to the recently published biography written by Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay, Narendra Modi kept this marriage a secret because without doing so he would not be able to climb the stairs of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, because this Hindu organization objected to the marriage of its key workers It shows
 varsh 2009 main bhi ek patrika ne jashodaben ko us skool main dhund nikaala tha, jahaan vah padhaati thim, lekin us vakt unhone saakshaatkaar se yah kehete hue saaf inkaar kar diya tha ki vah apane 'taqatvar' pati se darati hai
 Jashodaben, who got a pension of Rs 14,000 per month as a former government teacher, is living almost in seclusion with her brother in a village in western Gujarat
 saakshaatkaar ke dauraan unhone bataaya ki narendra modi unhen zyaada shiksha hasil karne ke liye kehete rahete the
 He said, i had left my studies when i went to his house, and i remember that he used to keep telling me that he wanted me to complete my studies
 vah adhiktar meri padhai puri karne ke bare main hi baat kiya karte the
 Of the 26 seats in Gujarat, the Vadodara Lok Sabha seat chosen by Modi is being seen as the most secure seat

 In this struggle, the team will try to win
 duusari taraf, australia kaa lakshya siries main ek or match jeet kar ajey rahanaa hoga
 The batsmen performed brilliantly in the first three matches, but due to the second-rate bowling, India had to lose in all three matches

 Except Ishant Sharma, Umesh Yadav, Barinder Saran, Rishi Dhawan all have a huge lack of experience

 Captain Steven Smith is well aware that there is always room for improvement even after the team is in excellent form
 smith ke ballebaajon ne teen baar 300 ke aas-paas kaa lakshya hasil kar unki chintaa khatm kar di he
 However, his lack of experience in bowling may be of little concern to him as the Indian batsmen are in excellent form at the moment
 tisare match main toss jeet kar bharat ko ballebaaji karne ke liye aamantrit karne ke peeche ye do kaaran bhi ho sakate hai
 Both teams can use their bench strength in this match

 But the police do not know why Lodha was just written in the FIR? Let it be known that Mangalprabhat Lodha is an MLA of the ruling party BJP in Maharashtra
 haalanki lodha group ne ek bayaan jari kar safai di he ki is vivaad se unka koi naata nahin he
 The mall was already built on the land on which the Hub Mall was built and the complainant Praveen Aggarwal did not have any deal with him

 Meanwhile, a good news has come for the players and Kalamand students
 diu (DU) ke college department str par isie or spotars cote main sweekrut siton main badhottaree kar sakate hai
 But it has to be kept in mind that the five percent limit for admission of ECA Sports quota is not breached in any way
 ye he badlaavabeete saal tak yah niyam sirf isie category ke liye lagu tha jo ab is saal khel cote ke liye bhi lagu hoga
 Under the new change, any college can give maximum five percent seats in the quota based on its total number of students
 lekin yadi koi vibhaag in koton main bhari jane vaali siten nahin bharta to khaali siten duusare department ko transfar kar saktaa he
 According to the new rule, if no student is not enrolled in ECA category in science, then these seats can be transferred to Humanities, but nowhere in this should the University's total 5% rule be broken
 admician prakriya se jude ek varisht adhikari bataate hai ki aksar yah dekhne main aata he ki student isie yaa sports category se admician lene ke liye science chunane ke bajaay humenities yaa soshal science chunate hai
 In such a situation, if the seats of science are transferred this way, then students will get more opportunities
 yah faisla somvaar ko baithak main liya gaya
 Preparing to fill all seats from both coats, the rule now is that all the sports and ECA seats could not be filled
 is vajah se yah tay kiya gaya he ki subject level par ise dabl kiya ja saktaa he
 Kota has five seats in English Honors and 5 seats in Urdu Honors as well
 agar urdu main koi student nahin miltaa, to in siton ko angreji onors main transfar kiya ja saktaa he isse angreji main paanch anya yani kul 10 students daakhila le sakate hai
 It has to be kept in mind that these seats cannot be more than 10% of the total seats in the class

 Keshav Prasad, who made himself known as the OBC face of BJP in Uttar Pradesh, is the deputy CM in the Maurya Yogi government
 pichley paanch saalon main keshav prasad maury ko soobe main raajnneetik pahchaan mili he
 BJP has returned to power in Uttar Pradesh after 14 years despite being the state president of Keshav Maurya
 yogi ke baad wo duusare number ke party main netaa he
 In such a situation, the responsibility of getting OBC votes in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections is on his shoulders
 chaay or akhbaar bechakeshav prasad kaa janm 7 may san 1969 main uttar pradesh kaushambi jile ke sirathu kasbe ke behad saadhaaran kisaan parivaar main hua
 While doing farming, he also ran a tea shop and sold newspapers
 garibi or sangharsh ke bich keshav prasad rashtriya swayan sevak sangh se jude or shriram janm bhoomi or goraksha liye anekon andolan karte hue jail bhi gaye
 Maurya, who has been a campaigner of VHP, was elected MLA from Sirathu assembly election in Kaushambi district in 2012 after losing two consecutive assembly elections in 2002 and 2007
 baad main 2014 loksabhaa chunaav main phulpur se jeet darj kii
 The interesting thing is that for the first time after independence in Phulpur, Keshav Maurya managed to feed lotus
 maury 18 saal tak gangapar or yamunapar main vishwa hindu parishad ke prachaarak bhi rahe hai
 Along with this, he was also associated with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh

 Which helped Keshav to delve deeper into politics
 rashtriya swayamsevak sangh se jude rahane ke samay inhone ram janmabhumi aandolan main bahut bad chadh kar hissaa liya
 Keshav, the command of BJP in UP, handpicked Keshav Morya of the party high command to return the BJP to power in Uttar Pradesh
 unhen 2016 main bijepi kaa pradesh adhyaksh banaaya gaya or unhone vidhansabha chunaav main ‘265 plus’ kaa lakshya lekar kaam shuru kiya
 Getting Dalit votes in the state is also considered to be a big reason behind making the president
 keshav prasad pichhadi jati maury se aate hai jisaki taadaad gaiyr yadav jatiyon main sabase adhik he
 KP Maurya, who is closest to the Mauryan Sangh and is one of the fiercest leaders of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, campaigned heavily for the party
 chunaav main maury achche vaktaa sabit hue or unhen party ke liye sabase zyada 155 chunavi sabhaayen kii hai

 Six people have been arrested in connection with a fire in a cracker factory in Sivakasi, Tamil Nadu
 is agnikand main 38 log maare gaye the
 a police officer in Virudhunagar district, 500 km from Sivakasi, said on Thursday, 'six people have been arrested in connection with the firecracker factory accident
 giraftaar logon main paul pandi bhi shaamil hai
 Paul leased the building, where he was running the firecracker factory
 'om shakti pataakhaa factory main buudhvaar ko hue is agnikand main marane waalon kii sankhya badhkar 38 ho gai he
 More than 75 people were injured in the accident
 police ke mutabik maare gaye va ghayal hue zyaadaatar log imaarat ke najadik se guzar rahe the
 After the explosion in the fire cracker factory, they were damaged due to stones and other materials
 visphot itnaa shaktishaalee tha ki pataakhaa factory main pataakhon ke nirmaan ke liye lagaae gaye kai chappar kuch hi samay main raakh ke dher main tabdeel ho gaye
 Police said the accident occurred around 12 noon Wednesday
 30 baje hui
 The fire quickly engulfed the entire factory
 2ji spectrum kii bahuprachaarit nilaamee buudhvaar ko samaapt ho gai
 This bid did not meet the government's expectations in terms of income
 isamen aadha se bhi kam spectrum ke liye boliyaan praapt huin hai or isse sarkari khajaane ko lakshya kii kareeb ek tihaai aamadani hi ho sakegi
 2G spectrum which gave shock of 1 lakh 76 thousand crore scam to the country has given a big shock to the countrymen and the government
 ummid thi ki 2ji spectrum kii nilaamee se sarkari khajaane ko 28 hajaar karod kii aamadani hogi lekin do din kii nilaamee ke baad sarkari khajaane ko mili 10 hajaar karod se bhi kam rakam aa pai
 According to preliminary calculations, the government has received bids worth less than Rs 10,000 crore in the two-day auction
 ullekhneey he ki 2010 main 3ji spectrum ke liye 35 din chali nilaamee main sarkaar ko 67,719 karod rupee kii boliyaan praapt hui thim
 There was a lot of discussion about the auction of 2G spectrum for the last several months and the government was aiming to earn Rs 28,000 crore by selling this spectrum in GSM band
 videokon tathaa idia ne saat cirkilon main spectrum hasil kiye hai jabaki telinar ko chah cirkilon kii boli main kamyaabi mili he
 Similarly, Airtel and Vodafone have got spectrum in each circle
 in paanch companiyon main se kisi ne bhi akhil bhartiya (pan india) spectrum ke liye boli pesh nahin kii thi
 In the auction, the reserve price of five mhz spectrum for the service network at all India level was fixed at Rs 14,000 crore
 sidime kii nilaamee se tata tele or videokon pehle hi naam vaapis le chuki thi
 Now the auction of GSM took just 2 days and the government got only 9 thousand 407 crore rupees
 dilli, mumbai, rajasthan or karnataka jaise circuiles ke liye to ek boli bhi nahin lagi
 The reserve price of 5 mhz spectrum across India was put at Rs 14,000 crore for the auction of 2G spectrum, but none of the five bidding companies bid for the pan India spectrum
 companiyon ne arakshit mulya ko kaaphi unchaa bataa kar isaki aalochana kii thi
 Probably, this is the reason why the companies' enthusiasm in the spectrum auction this time was cool
 2010 main 3ji kii nilaamee se sarkaar ko 67 hajaar 719 karod mili the lekin jis 2ji spectrum ne sarkaar ko jatke par jatke die uski aamadani ummid bhi puraa nahin kar pai
 The government's strictness on government teachers continues in Uttar Pradesh
 pehle teachers ko atendence ke liye apni selfi bhejne kaa aadesh jari hua to ab ek nayaa niyam banaaya gaya he
 up's Minister of State for Basic Education and Child Development and Nutrition, Anupama Jaiswal, has said for officers and teachers that if teachers in Uttar Pradesh schools use social media while teaching in class, then they will take strong action
 nae aadesh ke mutabik, adhyapakon ko padhaate vakt skool main smart phone ke istemaal karne kii bhi manaahi hogi
 Every work related to teaching every day or whatever activity they will do to children, they will also have to send a report daily to the whatsapp number of the government
 rajyamantri anupama ne yah chetavanee jila panchayat sabhaagaar main 'skool chalo abhiyaan' kaa shubharambh karte hue di
 He said that the council should take the initiative to create such an atmosphere in the schools in which the parents themselves get the children enrolled
 haal hi main barabanki jile ke sabhi sarkari skulon main shikshakon ke liye nayaa niyam lagu kiya gaya he, jahaan unhen apni upasthiti darj karaane ke liye nirdhaarit kakshaon ke saamne apni selfi bhejne ko kaha gaya he
 In order to mark the attendance of teachers, the District Education Office has been asked to post photographs on the Basic Education Campaign (BSA) webpage before 8 am
 jo shikshak nirdhaarit samay tak apni selfi aplod nahin kar pate hai, unka ek din kii selary kaat lee jaaegi

 1993 ke mumbai bam dhamaakon kaa sargana daaud, jiske daaman par ek nahin do nahin saikadon khun ke daag hai
 Where is India's most wanted and global terrorist Dawood Ibrahim? Aaj Tak found the answer to these questions
 karachi kii sadakon par chaahe trephic kii jitani maaramaari ho lekin jab don kaa kafila in sadakon par nikalataa he to maahaul kuch alag hota he
 After all, why not, because Pakistan's intelligence agency ISI has a hand on Don
 kya aap jaanate hai ki pakistan kii sabase badi security agency main se ek khud daaud kii he, jise pakistan sena ke kuch ritred general chalaa rahe hai
 This is to say that of former CBI officer OP Chatwal who pioneered to find Dawood's whereabouts while working for CBI
 chatwaal ne bataaya ki daaud ko mahange chashme pahanane, badan pe armaani kaa suut, kalai pe mahangi ghadi pahanane kaa shauk he
 Just like the dress of an industrialist or Hollywood star
 is tarah ke pahanaave se vah apane aap ko safedposh dikhne kii koshish karata he
 Where is Dawood? The answer is from Interpol to the US agency FBI, including the Indian government
 lekin is jaankaree ke baavjood daaud ibrahim par koi bhi haath nahin dhar paa rahaa
 Why? This question is special for us because since 1993, more than fifty cases have been registered on Dawood Ibrahim
 taskari, phiroti, apharan, bam blast or ab aatankwaadi gatividhiyaan bhi
 There is nothing for which Indian agencies are not looking for Dawood

 Understand, you are listening to a contemporary band called Sanam
 video main is band ke chaar sadsy namoodaar hote hai
 The face of Sanam Puri, the lead singer of this band Sanam, is also Salona like her voice
 sanam band bollywood ke clasik geeton ko nae andaaj or nai taravat ke saath pesh karata he or isse milanniel kahi jane vaali peedi uski divaani ho gai he

 The personality of the four is also suitable for this title

 Usually, these four appear in the same veneer
 bollywood ke puraane gaanon ko nae tevar main pesh karne kii kala ne unhen utyub sansani bana diya he
 The Sanam band does not play with the soul of old Hindi film songs as remixes
 sanam bharat kaa pehla band tha jise utyub par 10 lakh sabskribar mili the
 As of today, Sanam has around 67 lakh subscribers
 par yah sab ek din main nahin ho gaya
 Though the band's journey started in 2009, the seeds fell in 2003 itself
 tab samar muscat main rahete the or unke man main ek band banane kaa sapana palane laga tha
 His classmate Venky s also played guitar like him and needed a singer

 keshav ke gairaaj main kuch din tak jamaavade ke baad hamane ek band banane kaa faisla kiya, lekin hamen apane sangeet ko milakar taiyaar karne main kai saal lag gaye
 And finally we started working with Sanam Band ''

 Sanam also got a chance to perform at the 50th Independence Day celebrations in Maldives
 inke safar main ek sunaharaa work e
 R
 rahamaan ke saath 2016 main yaara naam kaa gaanaa bhi rahaa
 After a decade of existence when Sanam is one of the favorite channels of youth on youtube, band members like to keep things simple and easy
 samar kehete hai, ''ham geet kaa arth or uski mithaas banaae rakhte hai (jise ham cover kar rahe hai) or aisa mujic banane kii koshish karte hai jo sanam kii aawaaj se mail khaae
 Sanam's popularity is such that two of his videos Tere Bina Zindagi Se and Lag Ja Ghal are released within a month of release 6
 7 karod hits mil gaye the
 Now the band is also composing its original music and has performed in Israel, Mauritius, Maldives and Dubai
 sanam kehete hai, ''ham aise gane banane main vishwaas karte hai, jise aap har samay sun sakate hai- or aisa mujic jiskaa khumaar aap par Pramod Mahajan's son Rahul Mahajan has said that it is an injustice to not give tickets to my sister Poonam

 kanchi kamkoti peeth ke shankaracharya shri jayendra saraswati kaa buudhvaar subah nidhan ho gaya he
 He was 83 years old
 unka janm 18 july 1935 ko hua tha
 Jayendra Saraswati was the 69th Shankaracharya of Kanchi Math
 sanyasi samaaj kaa wo varg hota he jo samaaj se alag hokar niswaarth bhav se samaaj ke kalyaan ke liye kaam karata he
 Following the principles of Maths and Peeths, he understands the small and big aspects of man, society and life and keeps trying to balance and organize the society
 dandi sanyasi bhi unamem se ek hote hai
 The life of Dandi Sannyasis is very difficult
 ham bataa rahe hai dandi sanyasiyon ke rahan-sahan kii un baton ke jo aam logon se bhinn hoti hai
 When Adi Shankaracharya had made 'chandal' his guru, know that idolatry does not have its own principles when doing meditation
 dandi sanyasi brahmacharya kaa paalan karte hai or murti puja nahin karte hai
 It is believed that he attaches himself to the divine by going through the processes of his daily life and using the means of meditation
 is vajah se unhen murtipuja kii jarurat nahin hoti
 The way of living is also different
 dandi sanyasi kapadon kaa tyaag kar dete hai
 They do not wear stitched clothes
 dandi sanyasi bina bistar ke sote hai or basti ke baahar nivas karte hai
 When and how the tradition of monasteries started in India, who were Adi Shankaracharya? wo din main keval ek baar hi bhojan karte hai
 They do not eat in normal utensils
 aish or aaraam kii sari chizon kaa unhen tyaag karnaa padataa he
 Dandi Sannyasis never dine after sunset
 ve dinabhar main adhiktam saat gharon main bheeksha maang sakate hai or kuch na milane par unhen bhukhe hi sona padataa he
 The dead are not burnt after the corpse is not burnt
 diksha ke dauraan hi sharir ke antim sanskaar kii ek prakriya hoti he
 During this time, they attain salvation and after death the ascetics are not burnt like ordinary people

 ’’ Not only winning the majority in Assam on its own, the Bharatiya Janata Party has written a new story of political diligence that will be read for a long time
 kai dashakon tak bina kisi nattejey ke parishram karte rahanaa or dhire-dhire ek-ek seat hasil karte hue 90 se adhik siton ko jeet lenaa ek badi raajnneetik ghatana he
 Such an incident occurred in the states of West Bengal five years ago when for the first time Mamata Banerjee had overthrown the power of the CPM which had been frozen for decades despite her own meager resources
 yah bhi sahi he ki tab mamata ke paas rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ke prachaarak, kaaryakarta or bijepi ke netaaon kii tarah rashtriya or kai rajyon se laae gaye maanav sansaadhan nahin the, magar assam kii jeet kai myanon main aitihaasik he
 The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh workers have been working since the 50s before the Bharatiya Janata Party set foot in Assam
 60-65 saalon tak unki hi mehnat kii buniyaad kaa laabh uthaate hue bijepi ne jagah bana hi lee
 Tales of the hard work of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh activists will not be able to find a place in the saga of this big victory and we journalists may not be able to pick and collect those scattered straws, but this victory will fill the Sangh's anonymous activists in other states with enthusiasm
 yah or baat he ki is jeet ke peeche sampradayik yaa dhruvikaran kii raajnneeti kaa vishleshan bhi aata rahegaa lekin aar es es ke kaaryakartaaon ne kuch to thos buniyaad daali hogi jiskaa laabh bhartiya janata party ne apane sabase achche vakt main behatar tareeke se kiya he
 In Indian politics, such charisma has happened before
 dilli main bilkul ek saal puraani ek party 15 saal se jami shila dikshit kii sarkaar ko ukhaad phenkati he
 This victory of the Aam Aadmi Party made the bjp's defeat in Delhi as long as the Congress's defeat in other states
 uttar pradesh, bihar, pashchim bengal, madhya pradesh, chhattisgarh jaise rajyon main haarane ke baad congress vaapasi nahin kar saki
 Apart from Delhi, BJP could not return to Uttar Pradesh
 urisa main congress or bijepi donon naveen patnayak ko visthapit nahin kar sake
 After ten years in power in Bihar, she again came into opposition
 is lihaaz se bijepi ke paas bihar, uttar pradesh or dilli vaise hi hai jaise congress ke liye madhya pradesh, gujarat or uttar pradesh
 Even after this, BJP is different from other parties
 vah nai jagahon par jeet rahi he, vistaar kar rahi he
 The scale of issues and leadership is not sustainable, but in politics the RSS and the Bharatiya Janata Party have again established hard work as a strong scale
 bhartiya janata party kaa ek naam bhartiya jujharu party bhi ho saktaa he
 When the anti-indian quarrel party and the Jumla party are called, they should show leniency to call it a militant party
 bhartiya janata party prayaas karti he
 Makes the old new, enlarges the new
 jatiyon ko jodatii he, sthaneey lok devataaon ko puujati he, itihaas ke nayakon ko ubhaar laati he, nai party banavaa detii he( kerala main), puraani party se netaaon ko le aati he, apane muddon ko chhod detii he, dusron ke muddon ko le leti he, sab karti he
 In this sense, the Congress is a lazy party
 bhartiya janata party ram kaa naam leti he to congress ram bharose rahane vaali party he
 The victory of Assam is a unique example of longing to win in politics
 uski jeet bhale hi rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ke parishram ke kaaran sambhav ho saki he lekin is kram main bhartiya janata party ne ek or badlaav kiya he
 This party now behaves like a platform
 jaise twitor ke platform par koi bhi aa-ja saktaa he lekin twitor kaa malikana haq kisi or ke paas rahegaa
 If bjp's own leaders fail, then they bring leaders from other parties and make them their leaders
 loksabhaa main bhartiya janata party ke tikat par kitne hi purv congressi jeet gaye
 When Assam was in Congress, Hemanta Sharma used to accuse him of corruption, but when he joined BJP, the Congress could not open his corruption pole
 sonoval bhi assam gana parishad ke netaa rah chuke hai
 Such leaders also came in the Congress but they are still considered representatives of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh within the Congress
 gujarat ke shankar singh waghela
 The comments 2014 kii haar ke baad congress ne kahin bhi vaapasi kaa pradarshan nahin kiya
 The Congress has not attracted people looking for alternatives through its politics
 rashtriya raajnneeti main bhartiya janata party bhi 2 siton par pahunch gai thi
 At that time, the journalists who covered the Parliament say that even after two seats, the leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party never let the Parliament feel that the party was defeated
 do par pahunch kar bhartiya janata party ek baar vaajapeyi sarkaar ke rup main or das saal tak vipaksh me rahane ke baad is baar narendra modi sarkaar ke rup main kamyaabi hasil kar saki he
 Can the Congress, which has reached 44 seats, show this feat? It is not possible in the current situation
 congress ne apni kisi haar kii gahan samiksha nahin kii
 Will be done internally but does not show any symptoms in public
 bhartiya janata party iske liye congress kii aalochana karti he lekin aap un das saalon kaa bhartiya janata party kaa itihaas nikaalkar denkhe jab vah 2004 main centre se visthapit hui thi
 At that time people used to write about the Bharatiya Janata Party that it has not learned from defeat
 party ekajute nahin he
 Is factionalism
 assam kii jeet kaa paath kai tareeke se kiya jayega
 Increasing the voting percentage in Kerala is not a small success
 iskaa matlab he ki sanghathan kshamta ke rup main bhartiya janata party ek sajiv party he
 Is an active party
 rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ke kaaran ho saktaa he magar ab yah bhaajapa kaa apana charitra bhi he
 His workers appear active
 party ke vichaaron se las nazar aate hai
 The Congress worker is confused
 assam ke liye bhartiya janata party ko badhai
 The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh workers have been working since the 50s before the Bharatiya Janata Party set foot in Assam
