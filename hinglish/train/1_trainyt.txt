 varsh 1971 ke aam chunaavon main congress kaa chunaav chihn 'gaay-bachhda' tha, magar film 'maanjhi - da mountainman' main indira gandhi 'haath' ko majboot karne kii apil kar rahi hai
 Apart from this factual omission, the entire film is very filmy
 '60 se '80 ke dashakon main bihar ke gaanvon ke meley, ladakiyon ke hansane-khilakhilaane or riz jane ke dhang 'bollywoodiya satahipan' se aage nahin ja paae hai
 There is no water in Bihar even in dialect, and there is not even an investigation of the social problems of Bihar
 jameendaar bhi dikhte hai, or naksali bhi - magar itane sapaat ki kuch samaj main nahin aata
 This superficiality is visible even in the clothes of the characters
 jharkhand ke adivasee ilaakon main zarur ek daur main ladkiyaan sirf sari baandhti thim, magar bihar ke ganwai ilaakon main aisa nahin tha
 But perhaps the director did this in an attempt to make the heroine somewhat glamorous
 tippaniyan If anything notable in the film, it is the acting of Nawazuddin Siddiqui
 usne vastav main apane hisse kaa pahaad todaa he
 But it seems, the mountain of business compulsions had become so big in front of Ketan Mehta that he left the chisel-hammer of reality and started telling a half-baked story of love and mountain
 yaa to unhen dasharath maanjhi kii kahani nahin uthaani chahie thi, yaa phir uske takaazon kaa khyal rakhana chahie tha
 To make Dasharatha Manjhi one has to become Dasharatha Manjhi, but he did not show up with Kaleja Ketan Mehta
 vah bas jaise multiplex ke darshakon ko ek film bechney kii koshish kar rahe the - isliye bhi gaya jile ke theth ganwai majdoor ko uske pran or paseene kii abha se judaa koi naam dene kii jagah unhone use 'mountainman' bana diya
 In the '60s to '80s, the fairs of the villages of Bihar, the way girls laugh and wander, have not gone beyond' bollywood superficiality '
 boli-bani main bhi bihar kaa pani nahin he, or bihar ke saamaajik sankaton kii to padtaal tak nahin he
 Landlords also appear, and also Naxalites - but so flat that nothing is understood
 yah satahipan kirdaaron ke kapadon tak main dikhaai padataa he
 In the tribal areas of Jharkhand, girls used to wear only saris at one time, but this was not the case in the rural areas of Bihar
 magar shaayad nayika ko kuch glamras banane kii koshish main nirdeshak ne yah kiya
 The comments film main agar kuch ullekhneey he to vah navazuddin siddiki kaa abhinay he
 He has indeed broken a mountain of his share
 magar lagata he, kethan mehta ke saamne kaarobaari majaburiyon kaa pahaad itnaa bada ho gaya tha ki vah vaastaviktaa kaa chheni-hathaudaa chhod prem or pahaad kii ek adhpaki kahani kehane lage
 Either he should not have picked up the story of Dasharatha Manjhi, or else he should have taken care of his arguments
 dasharath maanjhi banane ke liye dasharath maanjhi bananaa padataa he, lekin vah kalejaa kethan mehta ke paas nahin dikhaa
 He was trying to sell a film to a multiplex audience like Bus - so instead of giving the typical Gawai laborer of Gaya district a name associated with his prana and sweaty aura, he made him a 'mountainman'

 yah vaaki acchhee khabar he ki mumbai ke gauravshaalee itihaas kaa hissaa rah chukaa liberty cinema ekta kapur or vishaal bharadwaj kii film ‘ek thi dian’ ke saath ek baar phir shuru hone ja rahaa he
 This brings joy to the audience, while producer Ekta Kapoor and Vishal Bhardwaj are very happy with the owner of the theater, Wazir Hussain
 dakshin mumbai ke anya mashhoor cinemagharon kii tulana main kam bijness de paa rahaa liberty cinema ek saal pehle band ho gaya tha
 However, Liberty Cinema, which has not been showcasing films for the past one year, has music launch parties and other minor celebrations of the film
 yahi vajah he ki navinikaran ke jariye is cinemaghar kii khubsuurati aaj bhi bachaakar rakhi gai he
 Interestingly, four films are ready for release at the Liberty Theater, which starts on April 19, but 'ek Thi Dion' is at the forefront
 ekta kapur or vishaal bharadwaj kii ‘ek thi dian’ se shuru hone ja rahe liberty cinema kaa gauravshaalee itihaas agar ek baar phir doharaaya jaae to is par hairat mat kijiega balki ise dyanon kaa pratap samajhiega
 Sir Viv Richards of West Indies, considered among the most aggressive batsmen in the world, sees nothing wrong in Virat Kohli's aggressive tone
 richards ne kaha hi mujhe viraat kaa aakraamak andaaj behad pasand aata he
 As a captain, he defies his players and i do not believe anything wrong in this
 westeindies ke mahaan cricketer richards kaa maananaa he ki agar viraat kohli or unki team england or australia ke khilaaf pichley gharelu satr kaa pradarshan videshon main bhi jari rakhte hai to bharat ‘mahaan’ tiimon main shumaar ho saktaa he

 sar richards ne yahaan kaha, ‘mujhe lagata he ki is tarah kii safalataa ke baad kohli or team ke liye aglaa str videshon main austrailia or england kaa saamana karnaa he
 If you can do the same as you have performed here, then the Indian team will join the 'great teams'
 ’ 121 test match khilne vaale is anbhavi cricketer ne bharat kii australia ke khilaaf siries ko sabase kathin siries main se ek qaraar diya
 He praised the team's consistency and Kohli's captaincy going forward, saying, "the recent home season has been very good, they have set an unbeatable record
" ’ richards ne kaha, ‘australia ke khilaaf antim siries mushkil muqablon main se ek thi
 He (india) performed well
 yah shandaar uplabdhi thi
 He also praised Virat for his aggression and defending his players
 richards ne kaha,‘aise vyakti ke taur par jo ballebaaji nahin ‘class’ dekhnaa chahta he, mujhe bataur captain uski (viraat kii) aakraamakata pasand he
 He will defend his players on every occasion and i don't see any harm in it
 ’ Sir Richards said here, 'I think after such success, the next level for Kohli and the team is to face Australia and England overseas
 agar aapane yahaan jaisaa pradarshan kiya he, vaisaa hi vahaan kar sakate ho to bhartiya team ‘mahaan tiimon’ main shaamil ho jaaegi
 The veteran cricketer, who played 121 Test matches, described India's series against Australia as one of the toughest series
 unhone team kii nirantarata or kohli kii aage bad-chadhakar captaini karne kii prashansa karte hue kaha, ‘haal kaa gharelu satr bahut acha rahaa he, unhone ajey record banaaya he
 "the final series against Australia was one of the toughest matches," Richards said
 unhone (bharat ne) acha pradarshan kiya
 This was a great achievement
 ’unhone viraat kii aakraamakata kii or apane khilaadiyon kaa bachaav karne ke liye prashansa kii
 Richards said, 'as someone who wants to see' class' not batting, i like his (virat's) aggression as a captain
 vah har maukey par apane khilaadiyon kaa bachaav karegaa or mujhe isamen koi bhi buraai nahin dikhti
 ' vishwa bank kii managing diarector shrimoolyani indravati ne kaha ki bharat vishwa main chauthi mahashakti ke rup main ubhar rahaa he or isaki asli takat desh kaa yuva varg he
 He said that the way the youth of the country are making their place in the global scenario, it is a pleasant sign for India
 indravati aaj jaipur ke malviya rashtriya audyogic santhaan main ek kaarykram main chaatraon se vaartalap kar rahi thim
 He said that India is gaining special recognition in the technical and economic field
 unhone kaha ki agar bharat main shiksha, bacchon ke poshan or mahilaon kii sthiti main or adhik sudhaar laayaa jaae to sthiti or bhi behatar ho sakati he
 He said that a recent research by the World Bank has revealed that the country where women are more self-reliant and economically prosperous has developed at a faster pace
 unhone mahilaon ko or bhi adhikaar or sammaan dene kii baat kahi
 He also praised the Beti bachao-beti Padhao program while praising the Prime Minister

 tahseen poonawala ne yah palatwaar hegade ke us bayaan ke baad kiya jisamen unhone kaha tha jo hindu ladakiyon ko chhue uske haath nahin bachane chahie
 Actually, Anant Hegde had said that if a person touches the hand of a Hindu girl, then his hands should not escape
 hamen apane samaaj kii praathamiktaaon ke bare main phir se sochane kii jarurat he
 He said, 'A man who touches Hindu girls, his hands should not escape

 He said that what is happening around us should also be watched
 anant hegade ke bayaan kii soshal media kii duniya main kaaphi aalochana ho rahi he
 In this sequence, Tehsin Poonawala challenged him
 meri shaadi pavitra he, mujhe na ghasiteshnant hegade somvaar ko karnataka main congress ke netaa dinesh gunddu raav se bhi ulajh gaye
 He made personal comments on his rival Congress leader Dinesh Gunddu Rao about his wife
 bijepi netaa ne kaha ki main dinesh gunddu raav ko aise shaks ke rup main jaanata hum jo ek muslim mahila ke peeche bhaaga tha
 In retaliation, Dinesh Gunddu Rao said, 'it is sad that he (anant Hegde) is making such remarks
 yah is sarkaar main oonche padon par baithe logon kaa str he
 They always use inflammatory language
 shaayad unki party ke log unhen aisa karne ke liye kehete hai
 Rao said, "but falling to this level and making personal comments shows the lack of culture
" vah na keval khud balki apane karyaalay kaa bhi patan kar rahe hai
 i hope the BJP people give him the right advice that he should not speak like this
 'tabu Gundu Rao on Union Min Ananth Kumar Hegde's tweets: There's a line leaders need to draw
 They should mind their language
 i want to state that i am not a political person, i am a housewife
 Why do you want to use me to polarize elections? At least you should redeem his chairhttps: / / t

 He said that the first thing is that he (dinesh Gunddu Rao) never ran away with me
 hamaari shaadi pavitra he
 It is a very bad thing to drag me into it
 unhone kaha ki netaaon ko ek line khinchne kii jarurat he
 They should keep their tongue under control
 main unhen bataanaa chaahati hum ki main koi raajnneetik vyakti nahin hum
 Why are you using me for polarization in elections
 kam se kam unhen aapni kursi kaa dhyaan rakhana chahie

 chunavi raajnneeti main koi bhi ajey nahin he, swaghoshit bahubali or raajnneetijna chanakya bhi nahin
 Nevertheless, there was an aura of the modi-shah duo that was seen in every election for the last four years, holding the opposition with a sense of defeat and the inevitability of defeat
 raajnneeti shatranj kaa khel he, jo aksar prachaar abhiyaan kii tarah hi dimag main bhi khelaa jaataa he
 That is why the results of these elections will finally give confidence to the opposition that no one is invincible, not even in the thorn battle in Madhya Pradesh, where it was hoped that the better organization of BJP could somehow save it from harm
 would be able

 The Congress has come out of the ICU but is still far from standing
 yadi congress teen rajyon main mili jeet kaa arth party ke purna rup se punerjeevan ke taur par dekhati he to yah bahut badi bhul hogi
 The party is now forming a government in four states, while the bjp's lotus is still floating in 16 states of the country
 congress kaa rajasthan main naaraazgi or madhya pradesh main lagaataar teen baar ek hi party kii sarkaar kii thakaavat kaa puraa phayda nahin uthaa paanaa party ke kamjor sanghathan kaa sanket he, jisamen abhi bhi ek anukool pich par nokout panch dene kii kala kaa abhaav he
 Unprovoked victory is not a resurgence but a relief for a troubled army
 agar yah jeet ek 'sab thik he' kii aatmatushti paidaa karti he, jaisaa ki ho saktaa he, tab congress ko ek baar phir jagaane kii aavashyaktaa ho sakati he: agar wo abhi bhi nahin jaagti, to chhattisgarh ke netaa bhupesh baghel ko dekhie jinhone dikhaaya ki 24x7 sadak par ladaai ladanaa kya hota he; yahaan tak ki kamalnath jinhone empi main bikhare hue sanghathan ko kuch swaroop diya, yaa sachin payalat jinhen lutian dilli ke jaal se baahar nikalne kaa fal mila

 bijepi dhire-dhire hindi pattee main apni pakad kho rahi he
 In 2014, a BJP wave took the states of North India from the west coast of Goa to Himachal Pradesh in the north
 akele hindi pattee ke kshetra main party ne 210 seat main se 192 siton par apratyaashit jeet hasil kii, jisane sansad main spasht bahumat kaa manch set kar diya
 Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh won 62 out of 65 seats: If the situation was the same as the December 11 results, the number would be at least half
 yahaan tak ki yadi ham yah maan bhi len ki aam chunaav rajyon ke muqablon se alag hote hai, to tathy yah he, ki lahar ruk gai he: pichley saal gujarat ke vipareet jahaan bijepi kaa vot share badha, hindi pattee ke in teen rajyon main party ke vot share main giravat ai he
 This is an ominous sign, especially in a situation when the BJP will face potentially challenging rivals like the SP-BSP alliance in UP next year

 But election results are often complex: BJP, for example, has retained its hold over a large section of rural Madhya Pradesh, loses the support of traditional Sarvana caste, yet retains a hold on the core OBC vote, perhaps the fact Confirms that the 'farmer son' Shivraj Singh Chauhan has retained his credibility
 rajasthan main bhi shaharon or gaanvon kii gahari khai kii jagah kshetreey khai zyada rahi, vahiin chhattisgarh main party ko puure rajya main nuksaan jhelana padaa
 The Axis My India poll shows that the party's tribal, Dalit, youth and peasant laborers have lost votes, a sign that the low-income group is disenchanted
 yah mahaj notebandi virdohi chunaav nahin tha, balki tihari maar kaa nateeja he: jisamen badhate tel ke daam, krishi sankat or rojgaar ke avasar kii kami ne bijepi ko baikfoot par kar diya he
 It is in a way the vengeance of the common man, the faceless Indian whose last weapon is the vote

 Regional satraps are unique
 hamane sochaa tha ki satta virdohi lahar bhartiya raajnneeti kaa nishthur niyam he; ham maanate the ki janata parivaar ke shashan or bhrashtachar ke aaropon se ghrinaa karti he; hamen kaha jaataa tha ki muftakhori na sirf arthvyavastha balki raajnneeti ke liye bhi buree he; ham sochate the ki vot bank jati or dharm ke aadhaar par bant gaya he
 Well, think again
 telugana kii 'gulabi tsunami' hamen yaad dilaati he ki kshetreey netaa paaramparik gyaan kaa anusaran nahin karte balki apane niyam khud banaate hai
 At a time when no leader wants to let go of power even for a day, K

 He promised that they would prove everyone wrong

 mizoram main bhi chunaav the
 In the clamor of the politically influential Hindi belt, we almost forgot that Mizoram is also an integral part of the Indian Union
 izol ke bhi nattejey kam mahatvapurn nahin hai: purvottar sahi myne main 'congress mukt' ho gaya or yahaan kii 25 loksabhaa siten agle saal mahatvapurn sabit hongi
 The winner is also someone who provides concrete lessons for our democratic impulses
 mizo neshnal front apane pehle ke avatar main ek ugravadi algaavvaadi sanghathan tha
 Who reaffirmed belief in the democratic process by abandoning the bullet for ballot
 jab ek dashak se satta se baahar rahane ke baad joramthanga mukhyamantri pad kii shapath lenge, tab is baat kii bhi pushti hogi ki 2018 raajnneetik bujurgon ke liye acha saal rahaa

 rahul gandhi kaa ek raajnneetijna ke taur aagaman hua he
 Rahul Gandhi's political 'arrival' has been an endless wait: don't forget that he made his political debut 14 years ago
 is dauraan, mistar gandhi raajnneeti main kabhi andar or kabhi baahar karte hue lage, unka upnaam hi sirf unki pahchaan ban kar rah gaya
 Even though he became the president of the Congress a year ago, it was more his coronation than a democratic election
 or jab vah pad praapt kar chuke hai, to unhen party kaaryakartaaon kaa sammaan arjeet karnaa abhi baaki he
 This election decision to some extent changed his always losing image: Mr
 Gandhi will now be seen by ordinary Congressmen in a way that could lead to a major victory
 isse adhik mahatvapurn baat aakraamak rup se agrani rahakar, apane sandeshon main drudh vishwaas or sthirataa dikhaa kar, unhone ausat congress kaaryakarta ke dimag se modi-shah ke rath ke dar ko hataa diya he
 They may still be in progress, they may still be prone to errors, they may be based on the principle of dynasty only where they are still, but even their greatest critics will now believe that Rahul Gandhi's Leadership cannot be ignored

 Beyond Gandhi and Hindutva nationalism, modi-shah needs a new narrative
 saal 2014 main modi daavedaar the, ek satta virdohi nayak jo puraani ravaayaton ko khatm karne aayaa he
 The role suits his personality of a '56-inch 'bahubali tart-speaking publicity: he could have consistently attacked Manmohan Singh's UPA government on all issues
 amit shah ke paas bhi ek rannitijna ke taur par bhoomika thi- kadi mehnat kaa master jo bijepi sanghathan ko ek nishthur raajnneetik ingine main vyavasthit kar saktaa he
 Both leaders now need to reinvent themselves
 modi ke nae bharat kaa nerrative mahaj ek naaraa nahin ho saktaa, ise shashan ke liye ek sarthak vikalp pradaan karne kii aavashyaktaa he
 What does reviving the divisive temple campaign and Yogi Adityanath's aggressive use and his brand of polarizing Hindutva politics reveal? Why is the Prime Minister silent on the slogans threatened by VHP protesters on the streets of Delhi to demolish Jama Masjid? And finally why there is a reluctance to accept that the demonetisation may have been done with good intentions, but this arbitrary move was very wrong, which affected millions of undecided people and ended small businesses
 The 22 crore families benefited from the government's program, such as the headline itself is not enough; There is a need for a visible change in the lives of those families through the distribution system
 jab rajasthan ke dausa kii raily main pradhanmantri ne chrishchiyan mishael or namdaar-kaamadaar kaa zikr kiya to yah un shrotaaon ko chhu nahin paaya jo is baat kaa aashwaasan chaahate the ki unke agle saal kii fasal vyapaaree-naukarshahi ke gathjod main kahi kho na jaae
 Amit Shah also has to realize that political rivalry is more than just attacking the Gandhi family or creating imaginary enemies such as Bangladeshi infiltrators, or Muslim families in the neighborhood
 badlaav ke dhwajvahakon ko bharosa or ashavad kaa positive agenda prastut karnaa padataa he
 It should not be that they only keep beating the stereotypes of negativity and communalism
 satta main zyada samay tak tike rahane kaa acha tarika kam abhimaani or zyada vinamr hona hi he

 2019 kii res shuru ho chuki he or bijepi ab bhi is daud main sabase aage he
 The results of these elections have re-affirmed the facts that even though the bjp's neeret is slipping, the election machine is still strictly in the hands of the BJP, whether it is financial resources, or the sepoys of the land
 congress bhale hi amit shah ke chunavi skool se booth management, soshal media management or antim qatari par khadey logon se sampark karnaa dhire-dhire sikh rahi ho lekin congress ke paas abhi bhi naa to wo dhan he or naa hi vaise log jo sangh parivaar ke samarpit kaaryakartaaon kii tarah kaam kar saken
 With the defeat of BJP, these cadres can come to work with renewed vigor next year
 telugana main 'mahakutami' kii haar ne vipaksh ke gathbandhan raajnneeti kii simaaon ko bhi saamne laa diya he
 Where the arithmetic of statistics is required to coincide with the equation on the ground for success
 is tarah se dakshin main congress kaa dwaar sabit ho sakane vaala darwaja ab band hota najar aa rahaa he
 In contrast, the BJP may have lost, but has not been dismissed yet
 modi ye ummid laga sakate hai ki vahi matadaata jinhone rajyon ke chunaav main bijepi ko nakaar diya wo aam chunaav main party ko saport karenge
 Here the slogan of Rajasthan should not be forgotten, 'modi does not hate you, Vasundhara is not your well
 " ab ye to tay he ki bijepi 2019 kii takkar ko 'modi ke mukaable koun' main badalane ja rahi he
 The main challenge for the opposition here is to change the national election to local in 543 seats across the country, where issues are debated and not given importance to the personality

 Media is not always a message in itself

 Never before in the history of this country has the media been so critical of the government's functioning; Never before has a person / party got so much prime time space; Never before has the media been so distracted by its moral obligation
 media dwaara team shah-modi kaa 12wein khilaadi kaa role nibhaane ke baavjood bijepi haar gai; isamen ham sabhi ke liye ek sandesh he: ye public he, sab jaanati he
 Voters have rectified their mistake

 hamaara makasad yah dikhaanaa he ki maanavtaa sabhi dharmon se upar he
 He claimed that the issue was being given political color without any reason
 beliaghat 33 palli puja cameti ke cheirperson arup sinha ne spashtikaran dete hue kaha, 'hamaara vishwaas he ki ham sab ek hai
 There is no inherent difference in us and there is no difference in the color of our blood

 yah sampradayik sauhaard kii ek jhalak he or ham iske saath adig hai
 Criticism on social media, but the event, aimed at creating harmony in the spectator Khushpuja Pandal, sparked controversy on social media, with many accusing it of being the 'peak of minority appeasement'

 unhone kaha, 'ye ve log hai jo hindustan kii samskruti or mulyon ko nahin jaanate
 When we wake up in the morning, Ajan is heard and in the evening we hear prayers
 dharm ek taraf hai lekin yah hamaari samskruti he
 Due to this culture, India has its own identity

 america ke khulaase ke baad 2007 ke samjhauta express blast ke taar pakistani ke aatanki sanghathan lashkar-e-taiyaba se jud gaye hai
 The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has started exploring the role of Lashkar in the Samjhauta blast
 iske liye enie mahanideshak sharad kumaar ke netritv main ek hai-level team america pahunch chuki he
 Pakistan's Arif raised funds for the blast
 In fact, the US Treasury Department claimed that Arif Kasmani, who lives in Karachi, Pakistan, raised funds for the express express blast
 aarif lashkar-e-taiyaaba kaa chif koordinator he
 After this claim, the NIA team headed by DG Sharad Kumar has gone to America for investigation
 blast main maare gaye the 68 log, zyaadaatar the pakistanidelli-lahore ke bich chalane vaali samjhauta express main 2007 main haryana ke panipat ke paas jabardast dhamaake hue the
 68 people were killed, mostly Pakistanis, in those blasts
 is maamle main saal 2010 november main giraftaar kiye gayeswami asimanandpar aarope tay kiye gaye the
 Aseemanand is also accused in the blasts at Mecca Masjid in Hyderabad and the Ajmer Dargah

 Former Bihar Chief Minister Lalu Prasad's crisis is not ending even after going to jail
 chaara ghotaalaa ke devgarh koshaghar se jude cese ke baad ab lalu ko chibasa se jude ek duusare cese main doshi paaya gaya he
 Apart from Lalu, a total of 12 people have been convicted in this case
 is maamle main lalu ko 5 saal kii sajaa sunai gai he
 Now questions are being raised whether Lalu will ever come out of jail in his time of political activism? Actually, this whole case came to light in January 1996
 jiske baad lalu yadav ke khilaaf alag-alag 6 cese darj kiye gaye
 The case reached the Patna High Court, which ordered the CBI to investigate the scam
 pehle cese main 5 saal kii sajachaibasa koshaghar se jude pehle cese main sibiai kii vishesh adaalat ne 30 sitambar 2013 ko lalu yadav ko doshi mana
 He was sentenced to five years in prison
 ye cese 37 karod rupee ke gaban kaa he
 Along with the jail, he was also fined Rs 25 lakh
 lalu ranchi kii birsa munda jail main band rahe or disambar 2013 main unhen jamaanat mil gai or wo jail se baahar aa gaye
 In the second case, Lalu Yadav was convicted by the special CBI court of Ranchi on December 23 in the Deoghar Koshaghar case related to the 3 and a half year sentence, after which he was sent to jail
 iske baad 6 janvari 2018 ko court ne unhen saadhe teen kii sajaa sunai or 5 lakh kaa jurmaana lagaaya
 Lalu has been sentenced to 8 and a half years in prison in two cases related to the 5-year conviction scam in the third case
 buudhvaar ko tisare cese main 5 saal kii sajaa milane ke baad ye badhkar saadhe 13 ho gai he
 Out of this, Lalu has spent about 1 year and two months in jail
 yani teen cese main hi lalu ko ranchi vishesh sibiai adaalat ke faisle ke tahat abhi 12 saal se zyada or jail main rahanaa padegaa
 If Lalu does not get relief from the High Court, then Lalu Prasad Yadav can hardly go to the public even in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections
 desh ko aazaadee milane ke agle paidaa hue lalu yadav umr ke us padaav main hai jo raajnneetik sakriyata ke lihaaj se ritairement kii taraf bad rahaa he
 The bigger crisis is that three more cases are pending against Lalu in the fodder scam worth Rs 900 crore
 duusari taraf teen cese main sajaa paa chuke lalu ke liye bel paanaa bhi kanoonee taur par badi mushkil chunauti mana ja rahaa he
 In such a situation, Lalu's activism has been seen in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Bihar assembly elections of 2020 and 2024 Lok Sabha elections after that, there are apprehensions about this

 Watch the trailer of 'fan' made by Shahrukh's real life fan: Watch the trailer of the movie 'fan': congress mahasachiv digvijay sinhane buudhvaar ko kaha ki baba ramdev kii bhi sampatti kii jaanch honi chahie
 Digvijay Singh said that Ramdev is not the only patriot in India
 baba ramdev ke bhrashtachar aurkaale dhanako lekar die ja rahe bayanon par digvijay singh ne yah pratikriya di he
 Earlier, this senior Congress leader had said on Monday that Baba Ramdev should declare his assets
 iske baad haridwar ke saadhuon ne bhi kaha ki ramdev ko apni sampatti kii ghoshnaa jarur kerani chahie
 The monsoon session of Parliament is starting from Tuesday and two days before that the Congress has given an ultimatum to the government
 congress mahasachiv ghulaam nabi azaad ne kaha ki sansad chalaanaa vipakshi partiyon kii zimmedaari nahin he balki ye sarkaar kii zimmedaari he
 If the government wants the session to go smoothly, then the government has 24 to 48 hours, but in the meantime, the Congress has also indicated softness regarding Sushma Swaraj
 sansad main congress bhartiya videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj ko sidhe nishane par nahin legi or na hi unako boycott karne jaisi kisi ranneeti par chalegi
 In the Rajya Sabha, Leader of Opposition and Congress General Secretary Ghulam Nabi Azad, in response to a question about Sushma being surrounded in the Parliament, said without mentioning that it was not a matter of any particular person
 party is maamle main ghire kisi ek kendriya mantri, saansad, mukhyamantri yaa vidhayak ko nahin gheregi balki is puure mudde ko zorshor se uthaaegi
 In response to a second question asked a little later, Azad demanded his resignation after naming Vasundhara Raje in Lalitgate and Shivraj Singh Chauhan surrounded by Vyapam
 isse saaf he ki sushamaa swaraj ko lekar congress kaa rukh naram hua he
 In the early days of Lalitgate's revelations, the Congress was very aggressive about Sushma
 har press kafrence main wo vasundhara raaje ke saath-saath sushamaa swaraj ke istife kii maang bhi karti thi
 Later, she completely engulfed Vasundhara
 ab jab ki sansad kaa monsoon satr shuru ho rahaa he, mukhya vipakshi party ke taur par congress ke liye ek tareeqa ye bhi tha ki videsh mantri ke taur par sushamaa swaraj kaa boycott kiya jaae
 Whenever he wakes up to speak or has to answer any question related to the Ministry of External Affairs, the Congress should leave the House or he is not ready to listen
 lekin congress kii taraf se mil rahe sanketon ke mutabiq, wo aisa nahin karne ja rahi
 a big reason behind the change in the attitude of the Congress is that many opposition parties standing with the Congress are soft on Sushma
 isamen argedy-jediu bhi shaamil he, jiske saath wo bihar main mil kar chunaav ladane ja rahi he
 Apart from this, the Samajwadi Party is also not directly in favor of pressuring Sushma for resignation
 sushamaa ko bijepi ke bheetar modi virdohi kheme kaa mana jaataa he
 In such a situation, the assessment is that if Sushma is the victim of opposition attack, Modi will get more open ground
 jabaki modi apane upar dabaav mahasoos kar sushamaa se istife ke liye kehete hai yaa unhen videsh mantralay ke pad se hataate hai to isse unki aapasi ranjish ko hawa milegi
 But the strategy is to surround Modi by retaining Sushma
 tippaniyan Modi's captaincy has to be questioned
 kuch-kuch vaise hi jaise manmohan singh ko eemaandaaree kaa certificate dene ke baavjood vipakshi party ke taur par bijepi 2ji jaise muddon par isliye gherti rahi ki ve sarkaar ke mukhiya hai or antim zimmedaari unki banati he
 An all-party meeting is scheduled to take place on Monday
 congress is baithak main tamaam choti badi vipakshi partiyon ke ravayai ko padhane kii koshish karegi
 After that, it will decide its strategy in Parliament accordingly
 shuruaati dinon main to zordaar hangaamaa hone kii puri sambhaavna he, lekin kis mudde ko kitna tool den or kis had tak jaaen congress is maamle main aflatoon ban kar ekala chalo kii niti nahin apnaanaa chaahati
 It is sure that as the main opposition party, Modi would like to appear to be taking the iron out of the government and BJP most strongly
 sarkaar agar chaahati he ki satr sucharu rup se chale, to sarkaar ke paas 24 se 48 ghante hai, lekin is bich congress ne sushamaa swaraj ko lekar narmi ke sanket bhi die hai
 In Parliament, the Congress will not directly target Indian Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj nor will it follow any strategy like boycotting her
 rajya sabha main netaa vipaksh or congress ke mahasachiv ghulaam nabi azaad ne sushamaa ko sansad main gherne ko lekar puche gaye sawaal ke jawaab main bina kisi kaa naam liye kaha ki ye kisi vyakti vishesh kaa maamla nahin he
 The party will not encircle any of the Union ministers, mps, Chief Ministers or mlas surrounded in this matter, but will raise this whole issue vigorously
 thodi der baad puche gaye ek duusare sawaal ke jawaab main azaad ne lalitget main ghire vasundhara raaje or vyaapman main ghire shivaraj singh chouhan kaa naam lekar istife kii maang kii
 It is clear that the Congress's position on Sushma Swaraj has softened
 lalitget ke khulaase ke shuruaati dinon main congress sushamaa ko lekar bahut hamalavar thi
 In every press conference she used to demand the resignation of Sushma Swaraj along with Vasundhara Raje
 baad main wo puri tarah se vasundhara ko gherne main jute gai
 Now that the monsoon session of Parliament is beginning, one way for the Congress as the main opposition party was to boycott Sushma Swaraj as foreign minister
 jab bhi wo bolne ko uthen yaa videsh mantralay se jude kisi sawaal kaa jawaab dene ko hon, congress sadan se uth kar chali jaae yaa unako sunne ko taiyaar na ho
 But according to the indications from the Congress, she is not going to do so
 congress ke rukh main aae badlaav ke peeche ek badi vajah ye he ki congress ke saath khadi rahi kai vipakshi partiyon kaa rukh sushamaa ko lekar naram he
 It also includes RJD-JDU, with which she is going to contest elections in Bihar
 iske alaava samaajawaadee party bhi sidhe sushamaa par istife ke liye dabaav banane ke paksh main nahin he
 Sushma is considered an anti-modi group within the BJP
 aise main akalan ye he ki sushamaa agar vipakshi hamale kii shikaar hoti hai, to modi ko or khulaa maidan milegaa
 While Modi feels pressure on him to ask Sushma to resign or remove him from the post of the Ministry of External Affairs, it will give air to their mutual rivalry
 lekin ranneeti sushamaa ko banaae rakh kar modi ko gherne kii he
 The comments modi kii captaini par sawaal uthaane kii he
 In much the same way, despite giving a certificate of honesty to Manmohan Singh, the BJP, as the opposition party, kept on issues like 2G because they are the head of the government and they have the ultimate responsibility
 somvaar ko sarvadaleey baithak hone vaali he
 In this meeting, the Congress will try to read the words of all the small and big opposition parties
 uske baad usee hisaab se sansad main apni ranneeti tay karegi
 In the initial days, there is every possibility of a loud ruckus, but how much to chant and to what extent the Congress does not want to adopt the policy of Ekla Chalo as a chaos
 ye zarur he ki mukhya vipakshi party ke taur par modi sarkaar or bijepi se sabase majbooti se loha lete hue dikhnaa chaahegi
 In the Rajya Sabha, Leader of Opposition and Congress General Secretary Ghulam Nabi Azad, in response to a question about Sushma being surrounded in the Parliament, said without mentioning that it was not a matter of any particular person
 party is maamle main ghire kisi ek kendriya mantri, saansad, mukhyamantri yaa vidhayak ko nahin gheregi balki is puure mudde ko zorshor se uthaaegi
 In response to a second question asked a little later, Azad demanded his resignation after naming Vasundhara Raje in Lalitgate and Shivraj Singh Chauhan surrounded by Vyapam
 isse saaf he ki sushamaa swaraj ko lekar congress kaa rukh naram hua he
 In the early days of Lalitgate's revelations, the Congress was very aggressive about Sushma
 har press kafrence main wo vasundhara raaje ke saath-saath sushamaa swaraj ke istife kii maang bhi karti thi
 Later, she completely engulfed Vasundhara
 ab jab ki sansad kaa monsoon satr shuru ho rahaa he, mukhya vipakshi party ke taur par congress ke liye ek tareeqa ye bhi tha ki videsh mantri ke taur par sushamaa swaraj kaa boycott kiya jaae
 Whenever he wakes up to speak or has to answer any question related to the Ministry of External Affairs, the Congress should leave the House or he is not ready to listen
 lekin congress kii taraf se mil rahe sanketon ke mutabiq, wo aisa nahin karne ja rahi
 a big reason behind the change in the attitude of the Congress is that many opposition parties standing with the Congress are soft on Sushma
 isamen argedy-jediu bhi shaamil he, jiske saath wo bihar main mil kar chunaav ladane ja rahi he
 Apart from this, the Samajwadi Party is also not directly in favor of pressuring Sushma for resignation
 sushamaa ko bijepi ke bheetar modi virdohi kheme kaa mana jaataa he
 In such a situation, the assessment is that if Sushma is the victim of opposition attack, Modi will get more open ground
 jabaki modi apane upar dabaav mahasoos kar sushamaa se istife ke liye kehete hai yaa unhen videsh mantralay ke pad se hataate hai to isse unki aapasi ranjish ko hawa milegi
 But the strategy is to surround Modi by retaining Sushma
 tippaniyan Modi's captaincy has to be questioned
 kuch-kuch vaise hi jaise manmohan singh ko eemaandaaree kaa certificate dene ke baavjood vipakshi party ke taur par bijepi 2ji jaise muddon par isliye gherti rahi ki ve sarkaar ke mukhiya hai or antim zimmedaari unki banati he
 An all-party meeting is scheduled to take place on Monday
 congress is baithak main tamaam choti badi vipakshi partiyon ke ravayai ko padhane kii koshish karegi
 After that, it will decide its strategy in Parliament accordingly
 shuruaati dinon main to zordaar hangaamaa hone kii puri sambhaavna he, lekin kis mudde ko kitna tool den or kis had tak jaaen congress is maamle main aflatoon ban kar ekala chalo kii niti nahin apnaanaa chaahati
 It is sure that as the main opposition party, Modi would like to appear to be taking the iron out of the government and BJP most strongly
 thodi der baad puche gaye ek duusare sawaal ke jawaab main azaad ne lalitget main ghire vasundhara raaje or vyaapman main ghire shivaraj singh chouhan kaa naam lekar istife kii maang kii
 It is clear that the Congress's position on Sushma Swaraj has softened
 lalitget ke khulaase ke shuruaati dinon main congress sushamaa ko lekar bahut hamalavar thi
 In every press conference she used to demand the resignation of Sushma Swaraj along with Vasundhara Raje
 baad main wo puri tarah se vasundhara ko gherne main jute gai
 Now that the monsoon session of Parliament is beginning, one way for the Congress as the main opposition party was to boycott Sushma Swaraj as foreign minister
 jab bhi wo bolne ko uthen yaa videsh mantralay se jude kisi sawaal kaa jawaab dene ko hon, congress sadan se uth kar chali jaae yaa unako sunne ko taiyaar na ho
 But according to the indications from the Congress, she is not going to do so
 congress ke rukh main aae badlaav ke peeche ek badi vajah ye he ki congress ke saath khadi rahi kai vipakshi partiyon kaa rukh sushamaa ko lekar naram he
 It also includes RJD-JDU, with which she is going to contest elections in Bihar

 There are reports of BJP candidates getting their tickets cut due to the alliance in Bihar
 ise lekar kaaryakartaaon main naaraazgi dekhne ko mil rahi he
 The biggest resentment is due to the ticket being cut by BJP national spokesperson and former Bhagalpur MP Shahnawaz Hussain
 bhagalpur seat jediu ke khate main jane kii khabar se vahaan ke kaaryakarta behad naaraaz hai
 He said that Shahnawaz Hussain has worked so hard in the last five years despite losing the election and this is being given to him
 shahanvaj hossain 2004 main hue upachunaav main vijayi hone hone ke baad 2009 main chunaav jite or 2014 main wo mahaj 8 hajaar vot se haar gaye lekin is haar ko chunauti maanate hue ve lagaataar bhagalpur kaa daura karte rahe or logon ke sampark main rahe
 After receiving the news of Shahnawaz Hussain's ticket being cut, all the party officials of Nauvagchia subdivision have offered to resign
 bhagalpur shahar main bhi kaaryakarta kaaphi naaraaz dikh rahe hai or tikat kii aadhikarik ghoshnaa hone ke baad naaraazgi or badhane kii ashanka he
 Shahnawaz Hussain has been a popular leader of the region
 kai kaaryakartaaon kaa kahana he ki ho saktaa he ki wo khul kar virodh na karen lekin chunaav main udasin hi rahenge
 Similarly, there is a lot of resentment among the activists about the possibility of BJP MP from Balmikinagar Satish Dubey being cut
 yah seat bhi jediu ke hisse main gai he

 Asaram Bapu, who was disputed and claimed to be a religious leader about the statement made in connection with the gang rape in Delhi, said on Wednesday that his statement was distorted
 mahakumbh main shirkat ke liye aae asaram ne yah elaan bhi kiya ki yadi koi yah sabit kar de ki unhone gangrape ke liye peedita ko bhi jimmedaar bataaya tha to vah use inam ke taur par 50 lakh rupye denge
 Significantly, Asaram had said recently that if the victim of 23 years had pleaded for mercy in front of the culprits and told them that she was like his sister, then she could have saved her honor and life
 asaram ke is bayaan par puraa desh ubal padaa tha
 The so-called religious teacher claimed, 'my statement was moved out of context
 peedita to meri apni potee kii tarah thi
 The media twisted my statement
 ’asaram ne kaha, ‘yadi koi yah sabit kar de ki unhone gangrape ke liye peedita ko bhi jimmedaar bataaya tha to vah use inam ke taur par 50 lakh rupye denge
 ' kabhi nitish kumaar se milakar jediu main apni party areldi kaa vilay karne ko taiyaar choudhary ajit singh ne abhi tak apane pattey nahin khole hai ki wo 2017 ke upi vidhansabha chunaav main kidar khadey honge
 If sources are to be believed, Chaudhary is trying his hand everywhere
 jediu ke saath hi bijepi ke bhi sampark main hai to congress se bhi baat kar rahe hai
 But now the matter has not been made anywhere
 sutron ke mutabik, choudhary ne pichley hafte 10 janpath jaakar sonia gandhi se mulaakaat kii, lekinchoudhary ko rajyasabha sitadene par baat nahin ban pai
 When Chaudhary wanted a Rajya Sabha seat from Sonia, Sonia did not give any assurance saying that she would think
 isse naakhush choudhary ne mulaakaat ke baad media ko koi bayaan nahin diya, ulate mulaakaat ko gupt rakhane kaa faisla kiya jisase kahin or deal karne kaa mauka bana rahe
 Even after the blow from BJP, Chaudhary met Sonia and thought that now his bargaining power will increase, but as soon as he met Sonia, BJP made a step forward and made it clear that, Chaudhary join BJP, his He did not agree to an agreement with the party
 vaise bhi pashchimi uttar pradesh se bijepi ke sanjeev baalyan sareekhe netaa choudhary ko saath lene kaa purajor virodh kar rahe hai
 He believes that the Jats are with the BJP as Hindus and if alone, Chaudhary will not have the Muslim Jat equation
 aise main choudhary apane hi bune jaal main ulajhate dikh rahe hai
 In fact, Chaudhary's party could not win a single seat in the Lok Sabha elections
 khud choudhary or unke bete jayant bhi chunaav haar gaye
 Since the time of his father Chaudhary Charan Singh, the kothi found in the Lutyens zone also had to be vacated
 sansad kii raajnneeti se dur ho gaye
 Now there are not so many seats in the Legislative Assembly that even one Rajya Sabha seat can be got, hence Chaudhary is wandering from rate to rate
 choudhary kii duusari mushkil he bete jayant choudhary kaa bhavishya
 Chaudhary's advisors believe that even though there is no atmosphere in western UP today due to the riots in favor of the party, the base vote of the party is Jat and Muslim, the same will bring the party back in the future
 aise main bhavishya ke maddenjar party ko bijepi ke saath nahin janaa chahie
 Even the SP and BSP did not seem to like BSP more than Chaudhary because he feels that the jat-muslim equation is not in favor of Chaudhary and the Muslim can live with the SP in such a way, but when he goes with Chaudhary a Muslim can move
 isiilie usne apni sabhi rajyasabha siton kaa elaan kar diya
 At the same time, the BSP also believes that instead of going with Chaudhary, she can take advantage of the Dalit Muslim equation
 kul milakar choudhary sahab philhal to majdhaar main khadey hai
 But any time Chaudhary, who is adept at changing his position, will not know which side Chaudhary himself will be, because this time he is going through his worst political time

 On the court's order, the BCCI said that they will not be able to take instructions till tomorrow
 is par court ne kaha to thik he ham aadesh paarit karenge
 'honor the court by not doing the word', the court said that the BCCI should respect the court not 'with the word' but with 'doing'
 court ne yah bhi saaf kar diya he ki bisisiai ko kisi bhi badi rakam ke bhugtan se pehle ijaajat leni hogi
 The court also said that there should be transparency in giving money to state associations and there should be a policy for this
 court ne kaha aap ek raat main sidhe 400 karod rupee kaa fund transfar aise hi nahin kar sakate
 The court has asked the BCCI to seek permission from the Lodha Committee for fund transfer

 The Lodha Committee said, "BCCI is defiant, it is not implementing reforms
 hamane bisisiai ko kai mail kiye lekin uske hamen jawaab nahin mili
 The BCCI is distorting the facts before the media
 ’bisisiai ne khaarij kii cameti kii siforisheniske jawaab main bisisiai ne court ke saamne apana paksh rakhaa or kaha, ‘lodha cameti kii adhikansh siforishein voting system ke tahat khaarij kar di gai hai

 But he had to stake his life to get India to enter the finals
 jagah surakshit karne ke liye unhone jo kartab dikhaaya use prodoonova kaha jaataa he, jise saal 1999 main rus kii jimnast elena prodoonova ne kiya tha
 It further consists of a handspring and two somersaults

 She won the Bronze Medal at the 2015 Hiroshima Asian Championships and the 2014 Glasgow Commonwealth Games and finished fifth at the 2015 World Artists Gymnasts' Championships
 wal street jarnal ne bataaya maut kaa khelprodoonova ko wal street jarnal ne maut kaa khel bataaya tha, kyonki jab bhi koi jimnast ise parform karata he to uske aapng hone kaa khatra to rahata hi he saath hi isamen jaan jane kii bhi sambhaavna hoti he
 Even a small mistake can destroy a player's entire career
 america jimnast simon biles kahati hai ki koi ise parform karne par mar bhi saktaa he or deepa bhi yah baat jaanati hai
 But this danger is very small in front of Deepa's courage
 yah kartab itnaa mushkil he ki ise aaj tak sirf paanch log hi parform kar paae hai
 Biles holds the record for the most gold wins in the history of the women's gymnast category
 lekin baavjood iske unhone prodoonova nahin karne karne kaa faisla kiya, jo unhen ek khaas badhat detaa he
 When American gymnast Laurie Hernandez was asked about Produnova after practice, her coach said, "thank you, but we won't do it
" biles ne duusare shabdon main kaha, main marane kii koshish nahin kar rahi,jaan kii frick nahin, najar sirf olympic medal paralekin reports ke mutabik deepa ne pichley teen maheene main olympic ke liye kii gai practice main is kartab ko 1000 baar parform kiya he
 The feat that Deepa is terrified of performing in the Olympics, is being done daily by Deepa
 khataron se loha lene vaali yahi cheez unhen auron se alag karti he
 The Olympic Games came when it was three months for practice
 iske baavjood unhone aakhri kshanon main rio olympic kaa tikat surakshit kar liya
 Deepa failed to stake claim for Rio after finishing fifth in the world championships
 lekin unhen jimnast federation of india ne test event ke liye bheja jo rio ke liye qualifi karne kaa aakhri mauka tha
 He took full advantage of this opportunity and won a gold medal in the event

 duniya ke mahaan vaigyanikon main se ek stephen hawking kaa nidhan ho gaya
 He did many researches about space-time in his life
 unhone kai siddhanton ko samajhaayaa he, jisamen bing baing theory or blike hole theory aadi shaamil he
 a film based on his life 'the Theory of Everything' was also released
 aaie jaanate hai unke kuch shodh ke bare main
 
 
 Theory of Singularity (1970) - Einstein's Theory of Gravity also tells about Singularity
 haalanki hawking ke shodh ke dauraan pataa chalaa ki big-baing darasal blike hole kaa ulataa patan hi he
 Learn - What is the Big Bang Theory? Stephen explained how the theory of the world black hole (1971–74) - Stephen Hawking did many research on black holes
 unke pehle siddhant ke anusaar, blike hole kaa kul sataha kshetra kabhi bhi chota nahin hoga
 According to another theory, a black hole is hot
 cosmik inflation theory (1982)-yah siddhant saal 1980 main alan guth (alan Guth) dwaara diya gaya tha
 He later explained that there is little change in the distribution of matter, that is, during inflation it can lead to the spread of galaxies in the universe
 dimag chhodkar stephen ke sharir kaa koi bhi ang nahin karata tha kaam, ye thi vajahunivers kaa wave function par model (1983)-stephen hawking gurutvkarshan ke ek kwantum theory kii sthapana main ruchi rakhte the, lekin james hartle ke saath unhone 1983 main hartle-hawking state model prakashit kiya tha
 This theory states that time did not exist before the great explosion and hence the concept of the beginning of the universe is meaningless
 top-down theory (2006)-hawking kaa kahana he ki brahmad main gurutvkarshan jaisi shakti he isliye vah nai rachanaayen kar saktaa he uske liye use ishwar jaisi kisi shakti kii sahaayta kii aavashyaktaa nahin he
 Why do we get scared every time we hear that we study in Hindi or mother tongue
 kya hamaare desh main log matra bhashaa main nahin pard rahe hai
 If you will see the expansion of government schools and evaluate the access to education of the poor, then crores of children are still getting education in their mother tongue
 isi dilli shahar main 12 bengali madhyam ke skool hai or 13 urdu madhyam ke
 The number may not be sufficient, but apart from Hindi, English, the city runs schools in Kannada, Telugu, Bangla and Urdu
 ye isliye bataa rahaa hum ki bharat main maatrubhaasha main padhai hoti he
 What is their status is a separate subject of discussion
 ab aapse poocha jaae ki aap apane bachche ko bhartiya bhashaa madhyamon main padhaanaa chahenge yaa angrezi madhyam ke skool main to aapkaa jawaab kya hoga
 Will answer this question without any whatsapp effect
 kya aap apane bachche ko angrezi madhyam skool se naam kataakar hindi madhyam main yaa bangla madhyam main bhejne ke liye taiyaar honge
 This question is mine and not from any government
 8 oktober 2015 ko times of india kii rima nagarajan kii report chhapi thi ki 2008-09 main dilli ke 9 zilon main se sirf do zilon main angrezi madhyam chaatro kii sankhya hindi madhyam chaatro se adhik thi
 This situation reverberates throughout Delhi within five years
 2013-14 main chah zilon main angrezi madhyam ke chaatro kii sankhya hindi madhyam ke chaatro se adhik ho gai
 Within five years, the number of Hindi medium students decreased by 1 lakh forty thousand
 matlab english medium skulon kii taraf logon kaa rujhaan badha he
 Did people put their children in English medium because Hindi medium schools were bad or did they move away from Hindi or mother tongue due to need of English
 yah bhi ek tathy he ki duniya bhar main maatrubhaasha main shiksha dene kii vakaalat hoti rahati he
 Scholars continue to consider it superior
 shuukravaar ke indian express main ashutosh bharadwaj kii khabar chhapi ki rashtriya swayamsevak sangh se jude shiksha samskruti utthan nyaas ne maanav sansaadhan mantralay ke saamne prastaav rakhaa he ki sabhi str par se angrezi kii anivaaryta samaapt kii jaae
 Mother tongue should be compulsory till class five in all schools
 har rajya main us bhashaa kaa vishvavidhyalay sthapit kiya jaae jisamen prabandhan, ejineering, medical kii padhai vahaan kii bhashaa main ho
 Immediate facilities for studying in Indian languages should also be provided in English medium institutions like iits and iims
 vidyalayon main kisi bhi str par videshi bhashaaon kaa anivaary vikalp na diya jaae
 The new language policy should be considered after reviewing the trilingual policy
 shiksha samskruti utthan nyaas ke pramukh deenanath batra hai
 In August this year, a report by Prachi Verma of the Economic Times published that many students are failing in the first year due to English medium and they are being expelled from the institute
 chah iaiti main kareeb 1 pratishat chaatr pehle varsh main angrezi ke kaaran nikaal diye jate hai
 Out of 3000 students of IIT Kanpur, 30 students were fired
 iaiti dilli ke 850 chaatro main se 12 ko nikaala gaya
 According to the percentage, the number of students fired due to language is less, but if someone goes out of such a large institution due to English, then his language and social background should also be seen
 aap jaanate hai ki maanav sansaadhan mantralay nai shiksha niti par salaah mashwara kar rahaa he
 Education Culture Upliftment Trust has only given suggestions
 wo abhi sarkaar kii niti nahin bani he
 It should remain clear
 hamaare sahyogi akhilesh sharma ne bijepi ke sutron se bataaya he ki ham desh ko peeche nahin le ja sakate hai
 South Indian states also have questions
 bharat vaishvik str par muqabla kar rahaa he
 In such a situation, no work is done without English
 internet kii vajah se global village ban gaya he
 English is a global language
 2014 main modi sarkaar aane ke saath hindi or sanskrit ko lekar ek khaas kism kii sakriyata dikhi lekin abhi tak sarkaar ne vyapak str par aisa kuch thos nahin kiya he jisase lage ki wo angrezi samaapt kar hindi yaa bhartiya bhashaaon ko protsaahit karne ja rahi he
 On the question of language, the BJP could talk on camera, but it is not necessary that the sources always like the camera
 2005 main yashpal cameti ne neshnal karikulam fremawork main kaha tha ki skulon main shiksha kaa madhyam ghar main boli jane vaali bhashaa hi ho
 The Yashpal Committee has used Home Language and First Language before Mother Tong
 cameti ne kaha tha ki skool praathmik str par home language main zarur shiksha den
 The comments yashpal cameti ne angrezi ke mahatv ko khaarij nahin kiya he
 Accepted its option but did not talk of ending the imperative of English like Education Culture Upliftment Trust
 2005 ke neshnal karikulam fremawork main kaha gaya he ki angrezi shuru karne ke str kaa maamla raajnneetik he, naa ki iske peeche koi academik yaa upyogita kaa mudda he
 Public opinion has to be respected at which level English should be taught in curriculum, with the assurance that we do not take the system further down which is failing
 iske alaava aresas se judi sanstha kaa suzav he ki har vishvavidhyalay das gaavon ko god le or shikshan sansthaaen ek basti yaa gaanv god len
 The Prime Minister has also asked mps to adopt villages under the Adarsh gram Yojana
 saare gaanv god le liye jaaenge to baaki agenciyaan kya karengi
 Panchayat to district agencies are not able to do this due to which villages are being adopted
 is par phir kabhi alag se lekin ek or mudda he is suzav patr main ki shodh kaa prakaashan adhik se adhik bhartiya bhashaaon main ho
 Translation of research published in English into an Indian language is mandatory
 shodh kaary ko rashtriya aavashwayakataaon se joda jaae
 How will research be linked to national need
 ham is par bhi baat karenge
 Will the research in poetry or story be considered as a national necessity, how will it fit the national need in research, will there be a National Requirements Commission, is there no research on the necessary topics at this time
 yah kehete hue is baat ko rekhaankit karnaa bahut zaruri he ki is vakt tamaam vishvavidhyalayon main khaskar rajyon main anaap shanaap vishyon par bhi piechdi hoti he
 However, are you ready to get rid of the inevitability of English
 phir se kah den ki ye suzav diya gaya he, sarkaar ne koi faisla nahin kiya he
 Now you will be asked whether you would like to teach your child in Indian language mediums or in English medium school, what would be your answer
 bagair kisi whatsap ke prabhaav main aae is sawaal kaa jawaab dijiega
 Will you be ready to send your child from Hindi medium school to Hindi medium or Bangla medium
 yah sawaal meraa he na ki kisi sarkaar ne bheja he
 On 8 October 2015, Times of India Reema Nagarajan reported that in 2008-09, only two of Delhi's 9 districts outnumbered English medium students in Hindi medium students
 paanch saal ke bheetar puri dilli main ye sthiti palat jaati he
 In 2013-14, the number of English medium students in six districts exceeded the Hindi medium students
 paanch saal ke bheetar hindi madhyam chaatro kii sankhya main 1 lakh chalis hazaar kii kami aa gai
 Meaning people have increased towards English medium schools
 kya logon ne apane bacchon ko english medium main isliye daalaa kyonki hindi medium skool karaab the yaa phir angrezi kii zarurat ke kaaran ve hindi yaa maatrubhaasha se dur gaye
 It is also a fact that there is an advocacy for teaching in the mother tongue throughout the world
 vidwaan ise shreshth maanate rahete hai
 In Friday's Indian Express, Ashutosh Bhardwaj's news that the Education Culture Uplift Trust, associated with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, has proposed to the Ministry of Human Resources to end the English imperative at all levels
 sabhi skulon main kaksha paanch tak maatrubhaasha anivaary ho
 a language university should be established in every state in which management, engineering, medical studies should be conducted in that language
 iaiti or im aadi angrezi madhyamon ke sansthaanon main bhi bhartiya bhashaaon main adhyayan karne kii avilamb suvidhaayen di jaaen
 No compulsory option of foreign languages should be given in schools at any stage
 tribhaasha niti kii samiksha kar nai bhashaa niti par vichaar ho
 Dinanath Batra is the head of the Shiksha Sanskriti Utthan Nyas
 isi saal agast main iconomik times kii praachi verma kii ek report chhapi he ki angrezi madhyam ke kaaran kai chaatr pehle hi saal main fail ho ja rahe hai or unhen santhaan se nikaal diya ja rahaa he
 About 1 percent of the students in six iits are fired in the first year due to English
 iaiti kanpur ke 3000 chaatro main se 30 chaatro ko nikaala gaya
 Out of 850 IIT Delhi students, 12 were fired
 pratishat ke hisaab se to bhashaa ke kaaran nikaale gaye chaatro kii sankhya to kam he lekin itane bade santhaan se koi angrezi ke kaaran baahar ho jaae to uski bhashaa hi nahin saamaajik prishthbhumi bhi dekhni chahie
 You are aware that the Ministry of Human Resources is advising on the new education policy
 shiksha samskruti utthan nyaas ne sirf suzav diye hai
 It has not yet become the policy of the government
 yah spasht rahanaa chahie
 Our colleague Akhilesh Sharma has told BJP sources that we cannot take the country back
 dakshin bhartiya rajyon ke bhi sawaal hai
 India is competing globally
 aise main angrezi ke bina kaam nahin chalata he
 The Internet has become a global village
 angrezi vaishvik bhashaa he
 With the coming of the Modi government in 2014, there was a certain kind of activism about Hindi and Sanskrit, but so far the government has not done anything concrete on such a large scale that it seems that it is going to finish English and encourage Hindi or Indian languages
 bhashaa ke sawaal par to bijepi camere par baat kar sakati thi magar yah zaruri nahin he ki sutron ko har samay camera acha hi lage
 In 2005, the Yashpal Committee stated in the National Curriculum Framework that the medium of instruction in schools should be the language spoken at home
 yashpal cameti ne madar tang se pehle home language or first language kaa istemaal kiya he
 The committee had said that schools must provide education in home language at the primary level
 tippaniyan The Yashpal Committee has not rejected the importance of English
 uske vikalp ko sweekaar kiya he lekin shiksha samskruti utthan nyaas kii tarah angrezi kii anivaaryta ko samaapt karne kii baat nahin kii he
 The 2005 National Curriculum Framework states that the level of starting English is political, not an academic or utility issue
 angreji ko karikulam yani paathyacharchaa main kis str se padhaayaa jaae is bare main janata kii raay kaa aadar karnaa hoga, is aashwaasan ke saath ki ham us tantra ko or adhik neeche na le jaaen jo fail rahaa he
 Apart from this, the institution associated with the RSS suggests that every university adopts ten villages and educational institutions adopt a township or village
 pradhanmantri ne bhi saansadon se kaha he ki ve adarsh gram yojana ke tahat gaanv god len
 If all the villages are adopted, what will the other agencies do
 panchayat se lekar zile kii agencia kya aisa nahin kar paa rahi hai jiske kaaran gaanvon ko god diya ja rahaa he
 There is another issue on this again separately, but there is another issue in the suggestion that research should be published in more and more Indian languages
 angrezi main prakashit shodh kaa ek bhartiya bhashaa main anuwaad anivaary ho
 Research work should be linked to national needs
 shodh ko rashtriya aavashyaktaa se kaise joda jayega
 We will also discuss this
 kya kavita yaa kahani main hone vaale shodh ko rashtriya aavashyaktaa maanenge, research main rashtriya aavashyaktaa kaise feet karenge, kya koi rashtriya aavashyaktaa ayog hoga, kya is vakt zaruri vishyon par shodh nahin hote hai
 It is very important to underline that by saying that at this time all universities, especially in the states, also have phds on unsolicited topics
 baharhaal kya aap angrezi kii anivaaryta se mukti paane ke liye taiyaar hai
 Let me again say that it has been suggested, the government has not taken any decision
 matlab english medium skulon kii taraf logon kaa rujhaan badha he
 Did people put their children in English medium because Hindi medium schools were bad or did they move away from Hindi or mother tongue due to need of English
 yah bhi ek tathy he ki duniya bhar main maatrubhaasha main shiksha dene kii vakaalat hoti rahati he

 yah kehete hue is baat ko rekhaankit karnaa bahut zaruri he ki is vakt tamaam vishvavidhyalayon main khaskar rajyon main anaap shanaap vishyon par bhi piechdi hoti he
 However, are you ready to get rid of the inevitability of English

 Dinanath Batra is the head of the Shiksha Sanskriti Utthan Nyas
 isi saal agast main iconomik times kii praachi verma kii ek report chhapi he ki angrezi madhyam ke kaaran kai chaatr pehle hi saal main fail ho ja rahe hai or unhen santhaan se nikaal diya ja rahaa he
 About 1 percent of the students in six iits are fired in the first year due to English
 iaiti kanpur ke 3000 chaatro main se 30 chaatro ko nikaala gaya
 Out of 850 IIT Delhi students, 12 were fired
 pratishat ke hisaab se to bhashaa ke kaaran nikaale gaye chaatro kii sankhya to kam he lekin itane bade santhaan se koi angrezi ke kaaran baahar ho jaae to uski bhashaa hi nahin saamaajik prishthbhumi bhi dekhni chahie
 You are aware that the Ministry of Human Resources is advising on the new education policy
 shiksha samskruti utthan nyaas ne sirf suzav diye hai
 It has not yet become the policy of the government
 yah spasht rahanaa chahie
 Our colleague Akhilesh Sharma has told BJP sources that we cannot take the country back
 dakshin bhartiya rajyon ke bhi sawaal hai
 India is competing globally
 aise main angrezi ke bina kaam nahin chalata he
 The Internet has become a global village
 angrezi vaishvik bhashaa he
 With the coming of the Modi government in 2014, there was a certain kind of activism about Hindi and Sanskrit, but so far the government has not done anything concrete on such a large scale that it seems that it is going to finish English and encourage Hindi or Indian languages
 bhashaa ke sawaal par to bijepi camere par baat kar sakati thi magar yah zaruri nahin he ki sutron ko har samay camera acha hi lage
 In 2005, the Yashpal Committee stated in the National Curriculum Framework that the medium of instruction in schools should be the language spoken at home

 tippaniyan The Yashpal Committee has not rejected the importance of English
 uske vikalp ko sweekaar kiya he lekin shiksha samskruti utthan nyaas kii tarah angrezi kii anivaaryta ko samaapt karne kii baat nahin kii he
 The 2005 National Curriculum Framework states that the level of starting English is political, not an academic or utility issue

 Apart from this, the institution associated with the RSS suggests that every university adopts ten villages and educational institutions adopt a township or village

 2005 main yashpal cameti ne neshnal karikulam fremawork main kaha tha ki skulon main shiksha kaa madhyam ghar main boli jane vaali bhashaa hi ho

 cameti ne kaha tha ki skool praathmik str par home language main zarur shiksha den
 The comments yashpal cameti ne angrezi ke mahatv ko khaarij nahin kiya he
 Accepted its option but did not talk of ending the imperative of English like Education Culture Upliftment Trust
 2005 ke neshnal karikulam fremawork main kaha gaya he ki angrezi shuru karne ke str kaa maamla raajnneetik he, naa ki iske peeche koi academik yaa upyogita kaa mudda he
 Public opinion has to be respected at which level English should be taught in curriculum, with the assurance that we do not take the system further down which is failing

 After the implementation of GST, it is possible to change the tax regime in this budget

 Archit Gupta, founder and CEO of online portal cleartax, which provides business and common man support in tax and financial matters, says that after the ban, there was a hope that tax collection would increase, but it did not happen

 After the implementation of GST, the collection of indirect tax has been less than the target

 Make NPS tax friendly: In India, the National Pension System (NPS) is the best way to save for retirement
 centre sarkaar tex nitiyon ke jariye is skim main nivesh ko badhaava de sakati he
 The government can increase annuity rates for this

 Currently, investment in NPS is much more cumbersome than EPF and PPF
 maujuuda samay main enpies se 20 fisadi viddrial texable he
 At the same time, 40 percent of the amount is kept in annuity
 is vajah se zyada log isamen nivesh nahin karte
 Medical reimbursement limit will increase? Government can also increase the limit of medical reimbursement (medical reimbursement) in this budget
 maujuuda samay main chikitsa kharch kaaphi zyada bad gaya he
 At such a time, tax-free exemption of up to 15 thousand rupees on medical expenses is proving insufficient
 aise main ummid he ki sarkaar ise badhaakar 30 hajaar rupee kar sakati he
 The medical reimbursement is claimed under the tax free limit
 philhal clem karne kii seemaa 15 hajaar rupee tay he
 By increasing its limit, the government can help provide some relief to the medical expenses

 Given the rising property prices and other expenses, the government may increase this limit

 After demonetisation, people have invested a lot of money in them

 In such a situation, instead of bringing them under the tax net, the government should increase their holding period

 Historically, Bihar had been the glorious and traditional land of the three first and most powerful empires of India — the first was the Magadha Empire (sixth and fifth centuries BCE) under Ajatshatru, the Mauryan Empire (332 BCE – 185 BCE) in which The wise and powerful Emperor Ashoka was involved and the Gupta Empire (320 to 350 AD) was led by Samudragupta and Chandragupta-11

 Later Pataliputra (present-day Patna) became the capital of the second empire i

 the happy Maurya Empire and then the Magadha Empire during the Gupta dynasty

 But there were long periods of decline after independence
 1990 or 2005 ke bich 15 varshon main tej giravat dekhi gai
 In the last decade (2004-05 to 2014-15), Bihar has emerged as the fastest growing state of India, breaking the structures of the past
 bihar pichley dashak main 10 fisadi se zyada kii salanaa vruddhi dar se aage badha or isane apni arthvyavastha ko dogune se zyada badhaayaa
 According to the Bihar Economic Survey, during 2016-17, this state recorded 10
 3 fisadi kii aarthik vruddhi dar hasil kii, jabaki is dauraan rashtriya ausat 7 fisadi tha
 These could be some of the reasons for Bihar's high growth rate - the low base of the last decade due to economic stagnation and the good effect of the very fast phase of global growth (2003-2012)
 magar jo baat khaas taur par prabhavit karti he, vah he bihar kii arthvyavastha kii dahaai ankon kii vruddhi ko ek dashak tak banaae rakhana
 On the other hand, when compared to other sick states, for example, its western neighbor Uttar Pradesh during this period 6

 Similar is the story of Odisha, which recorded a slower growth rate than Banisbatan in the same period, while it has a far better state of trade because of its 560 km long coastline

 The reality is that if we compare the past record of Bihar's growth with all the sick states, then this state seems to be somewhere ahead of them

 a significant feature of this metamorphosis in literacy rate is the rise in female literacy
 bihar kii mahila sakshartaa dar takreeban 18 fisad ankon kii badhotaree ke saath rashtriya mahila sakshartaa dar se kulaanche bhar rahi he
 Despite this, Bihar will still have a long way to go to match the literacy of other states in the country, as Bihar has a literacy rate of 64 per cent in 2018, compared to the country's average of 74 per cent

 "if 2005-06, when Chief Minister Nitish Kumar comes to power, is taken as a divisive year, then this pace of growth seems even faster
 viramani bataate hai, "yah vruddhi dar 1993-94 se 2005-06 ke bich 4

 Virmani assesses, "these sectors were communications (27

 1 percent), registered manufacturing (13

 "law and order restored by Nitish Kumar after a long period of pathetic government and inferior capacity of the state has been the main reason for Bihar's growth

 What are the other factors that led to the transformation of Bihar in 2004-05? Professor Sudipto Mundle, a former member of the 14th Finance Commission, sees the Bihar growth story from a public finance perspective, setting strategic spending targets for development programs and fiscal consolidation
 mundley kehete hai, "haal ke varshon main vikaas ke maamle main bihar ke majboot pradarshan kii duusari vajah rajkoshiya haalat kaa majboot hona he
 In the spectacular turnaround of Bihar's development, the beginning of saving money in the revenue account, increasing share of capital expenditure and increasing expenditure on development works are most important
 ''saarvajanik kshetra main puunji par jor dene kaa ek taqatvar upaay puunjigat kharch he
 In other ways, capital expenditure provides spending figures on public welfare works such as roads, telecommunications and power distribution systems
 vahiin vikaas ke kharch se, jinamein puunjigat kharch or rajasav, donon shaamil hote hai, vikaas kii tamaam sevaaon par sarkari kharch ko aanka ja saktaa he
 The ratio of revenue growth and the GDPP led to fiscal consolidation, which can be attributed not only to the increase in revenue of the state but also to the increase in funds from the Center
 bihar sarkaar ke rajasav main centre se milane vaali rakam kaa hissaa 75 fisadi he
 However, the main part of the central money is Bihar's compulsory share in central taxes, which has been recommended by many finance commissions

 ''vishesh darje kii sthitibihar jaise garib rajya kendriya fund par bahut zyada nirbhar hote hai

 Financial commissions are of little help as they are able to provide only a part of the central fund
 gadgil formula bhi kuch hi madad kar paata he
 According to Mundle, states are funded informally under centrally sponsored schemes, not under any interstate fair rule
 bihar is sangheey hastantaran pranali kaa sabase zyada shikaar hua he
 Mundle says that since Bihar is the poorest state among the general category states, its claim to receive "a special aid package from the Center to compensate for its financial losses is the strongest
" ''lok vitt visheshgy em
 Govinda Rao argues, "bihar stands at the lowest rung among general category states in terms of per capita development expenditure due to insufficient central transfers to compensate Bihar

 "regional variation and cultural diversity
 The fertile alluvial soil, rich water and vegetation and biodiversity brought from the Ganges and its tributaries — Kamala, Kosi, Son and many other small rivers are the most important natural resources of Bihar

 However, during this period, the state's economic situation has started changing
 do ankon kii vikaas dar ke saath, rajkoshiya samajhadaari, buniyadi dhaanche ke lakshith vikaas, gaanvon kaa bade paimaane par vidyutikaran, cycle dekar ladakiyon ko skool aane ke liye protsaahan or sharabbandi ke saath bihar ne vikaas or sushasan kaa nayaa adhyay likhnaa shuru kar diya
 It is very difficult for a state whose economy is mainly in the service sector to sustain double-digit economic growth for a long time
 haalanki haal hi main bagbani or khaadya prasanskaran udyog ke saath krishi par kuch jor diya gaya he, lekin madhya pradesh or chhattisgarh jaise rajyon kii tulana main, bihar main krishi utpaadakta abhi bhi kaaphi kam he
 Bihar needs to change its strategy of development
 uttar main aane vaali baadh tathaa dakshin main hone vaale sookhe kii sthiti se nipatane par adhik dhyaan kendrit karke rajya ko krishi ke vikaas par jor dene kii jarurat he
 The river Ganges passes almost the entire state from east to west and is like a boon
 haalanki, baari talachat or pradooshan ne ganga ko badahaal kar diya he
 The picture of Bihar's agriculture can be changed by effective water management through small dams and investing heavily in canals, ponds and other irrigation arrangements, as it has fertile alluvial soil and abundant water
 rajya main krishi kii vifaltaa or yuvaaon ke liye naukariyon kii kami ke kaaran desh ke anya dakshini or pashchimi rajyon, yahaan tak ki madhya-purv or duniya ke anya kshetron main bihar ke logon kaa antaheen palaayan ho rahaa he
 The beggar Thakur molded his Bhojpuri theater in Bidesia, which became very popular, as men migrated to remote areas in search of livelihood and the suffering of suffocating wives, helpless parents and children in village homes
 bihar main yah bidesiya daur ab bhi jari he
 However, initiatives like quota, livelihood program for women, cycle scheme for girls, and empowerment of women through initiatives like panchayat elections have started to change the face of villages in Bihar
 lekin bihar ke badlaav kii yah puri kahani seva kshetra par aadhaarit he or isamen kuch hissedari krishi kii bhi he
 Due to lack of industrialization, this story of development of Bihar is not getting momentum
 ity kshetra ko viksit karne kii disha main kuch pahalen to kii gai hai, lekin khanij sampada kii kami ke kaaran (jo ki 2000 main jharkhand ke hisse chalaa gaya tha) bihar ke niti nirmaataaon ko post kar diya he
 They have failed to formulate some effective policies to develop industry
 endie sarkaar kii ore se taiyaar 2016 kii audyogic niti main soochna praudyogiki, khaadya prasanskaran or radimaid vastra nirmaan ko hi praathamikta di gai he
 But Bangalore and Hyderabad did not become Silicon Valley of the country overnight
 bihar ke niti nirmaataaon ko gunvatttapurna shiksha niti par dhyaan kendrit karnaa hoga taaki shandaar software ejeeniyar or atyaadhunik start-ap antrapranyor taiyaar ho saken
 There has never been a local entrepreneurial class in Bihar
 korabari zyaadaatar pashchimi bhartiya rajyon se yahaan aae or unamem se kai behatar avasar dikhne par desh ke anya rajyon main chale gaye
 a good start can be made in this direction by attracting Bihari migrants settled in different parts of India and the world
 lekin iske liye bihar ko vishwastareey buniyadi dhaancha, ucch gunvattta vaale shiksha sansthaanon or ek majboot healthcare system kii jarurat hogi

 We can not only be stuck in remembering the golden tale of the past, but this extraordinary region of India has been providing both inspiration and guidance to the country in the past
 '' bihar ko sen kii baton par gaur karne kii jarurat he or use apane gauravshaalee itihaas se sabak lekar aage baduya hoga

 There are two parts to this assessment: the best performing district at a given time and the most improved district over the past decade

 Ten categories were selected, each of which was an index consisting of criteria for which uniform, consistent data were available
