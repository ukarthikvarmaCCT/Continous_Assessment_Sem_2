 In the case of death of more than 100 children from encephalitis in Muzaffarpur, Bihar, is everything not going well between the BJP and JDU, the two partners of the Bihar government? This question is arising because Bihar Chief Minister Sushil Modi is seeking funds from the Union Finance Minister in Delhi for the work for which Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has already issued instructions
 mujffarpur main 100 bed ke isiu or research centre ke liye susheel modi ne kendriya vitt mantri se 100 karod rupee kii maang kii he
 Whereas during the visit to Muzaffarpur last Tuesday itself, the Chief Minister had instructed the Principal Secretary of Health Department for its construction and said that to increase the capacity of this hospital and ensure the provision of 2500 beds here
 is disha main avilamb faisla lete hue tatkaal pratham charan main 1500 bed kaa prabandh kiya jaae
 a 100-bed Pediatrics ICU will be built here
 susheel modi ne yah maang dilli main kendriya vitt mantri nirmala sitaraman se mulaakaat ke dauraan kii
 This demand was made by Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi in a pre-budget meeting with the state finance ministers headed by Union Finance Minister Nirmala Seemaraman at Vigyan Bhawan, Delhi
 unhone nae ames ke nirmaan kii jagah rajya ke puraane medical college ko hi ames main parivartit karne kii maang bhi kii
 It is worth noting that Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar visited the Sri Krishna Medical College Hospital (SKMCH) in Muzaffarpur on Tuesday and took detailed information regarding illiterate children suffering from acute encephalitis syndrome and gave many instructions regarding better medical system
 mukhyamantri ne swasthya vibhaag ke pradhan sachiv ko nirdesh dete hue kaha tha ki is aspataal kii kshamta badhayen or yahaan 2500 bistar kii vyavastha sunishchit karen
 Taking immediate decision in this direction, 1500 beds should be arranged in the first phase immediately
 yahaan 100 bed kaa pediatrix isiu banaaya jayega
 However, the health department officials say that it was clear from the instruction of Nitish Kumar that the Bihar government will build this ICU with its own money as the entire expenditure on the machine will come to Rs 50 crore
 lekin unka kahana hai kii susheel modi ye dikhaanaa chaahate hai ki unke prayaas se ye paisa centre ne de diya
 In this case, everything is not going well in BJP and JDU, it is also known that senior BJP leader and well-known doctor in Bihar CP CP Thakur had written a letter to the Prime Minister in the case on Thursday
 seepi thakur ne kaha ki mujffarpur main centre sarkaar ke biochemical lab kii sthapana kii ghoshnaa kii ja sakati thi jo multi speshility suvidha se yukt ho

 Advani has written that electoral corruption has led to the downfall of Indira Gandhi's government and history will repeat itself once again due to the current corruption in the country
 adwani ne apane blog par likhaa, bharat ko swatantra hue chah dashak se adhik ho gaye hai
 In the first three decades, the Congress Party's monopoly in power in the country continued
 zyaadaatar pradeshon main congress hi satta main rahi
 The condition was that no non-congress party in the Lok Sabha could even achieve the status of official opposition in the opposition, whose leader could be called the Leader of the Opposition
 unhone likhaa he ki 70 ke dashak ke madhya main, gujarat main bhrashtachar ke khilaaf shaktishaalee andolan shuru hua
 This inspired Jai Prakashji to motivate the students in Bihar to take steps against corruption and the same campaign came with JP, ABVP and RSS
 bhaajapa netaa ne likhaa, main chunaav sudhaar main unki ruchi ke chalate unase mila
 He repeatedly said that the roots of corruption in public life are rooted in the corruption of the Congress government, so this problem cannot be effectively dealt with as long as the opposition parties remain divided
 adwani ke mutabik bhrashtachar ke khilaaf jepi ke is andolan se hi jansangh, congress :o:, sapa or bldi saath aae or janata morcha ke taur par gujarat main ullekhneey jeet darj kii, jo tab tak congress kaa majboot garh tha
 He wrote, Gujarat's verdict came on June 12, 1975, the same day the Allahabad High Court declared Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's Lok Sabha victory over Rae Bareli invalid and disqualified her for six years on grounds of electoral corruption
 adwani ne 12 june kii in donon ghatnaon ke sandarbh main likhaa, in donon ghatnaon ke baad apatkaal, ek lakh se bhi zyada logon ko kaid main daalane or press par pabandi jaisi hilaa dene vaali ghatnaayen saamne ain
 Advani has written that all this ended with the defeat of Congress in the Lok Sabha elections of March 1977 and the first non-congress government was formed under Morarji Desai
 unhone likhaa, isse spasht hua ki desh ke raajnneetik itihaas main pehle terning point kaa ahm utprerak bhrashtachar rahaa
 Advani, it is no surprise that for the second time, six decades after the enactment of our Constitution, corruption may prove to be the biggest catalyst for change

 China started operating its first major dam on the Brahmaputra River (yarlung Zangbo in China and Siang in Arunachal Pradesh) on 13 October
 yah lhasa se 140 kilometre dakshin-purv main jangamu main nadi ke madhya pravaah main bani 510 megawatt kii ek panbizli pariyojna he, nadi ke nichle pravaah par hone vaale jiske asar ko lekar bharat lagaataar chintit rahaa he
 This is just the beginning of the Chinese plan to take the aggressive flow of the river through several dams in Tibet itself

 "this river alone has the power to run two three gorges like dams," says Zhang

 It will be a gigantic 38 GW dam that will be constructed in the Brahmaputra's Great Bend, a stunning pass where the river thunders from a height of about 1,000 meters before turning towards India
 panbizli ke visheshgyon samet bharat or china ke adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki jangamu baandh kaa nadi ke nichle pravaah par nunatam asar hoga, kyonki yah pariyojna 'nadi ke pravaah kii disha main' banaai gai he jisamen vishaal jalashay nahin he or iske pravaah ko bhi modaa nahin gaya he
 Concerns for India, however, are those dams to be built on this river whose plans have been prepared by Chinese companies

 The Chinese government now wants to play more and more bets on hydroelectric projects, because on one hand, China's nuclear sector has slowed down due to monitoring reviews, and secondly, it has also set an ambitious target to cut carbon emissions, which was announced by President Xi Jinping did his US tour in September

 All three projects were approved in 2013 and the NPC in its report asked them to expedite their work so that they could be started in three years

 a former official of the National Development and Reform Commission, China's supreme planning agency, says that the officials of Gezuba are far more powerful than China's environmental regulatory body that approves dams
 apni website par gesuba ne tibet main aisi pariyojnaon ke sambandh main apni mahatvakankshi yojana kaa zikr kiya he jisamen great bend yani motau yaa medog par banane vaali pariyojna bhi shaamil he
 The company estimates that the country's next two five-year plans (the 13th Plan for 2016-2020 and the 14th Plan by 2021-2025) will focus more on proposed hydroelectric projects in Tibet and this will be done exclusively after 2020

 gesuba kaa anumaan he ki is saal ke ant tak sabhi chaar ikaayiyon kaa parichaalan shuru kiya ja sakegaa
 Zhang says that "there is a need to build a dam" across Yarlung Zangbo
 isse ''pani kaa behatar prabandhan karne main madad milegi, zyada bijli paidaa kii ja sakegi or jeevashm eendhanon kaa kam istemaal karke greenhouse gaison ke utsarjan main katautee kii ja sakegi'' unke mutabik panbizli pariyojnaayen itani urja de sakati hai jitani 25 karod ton koyale se milti he
 He says, "if China wants to cut emissions, then its way is hydropower

 The Assam Chief Minister has criticized Prime Minister Narendra Modi for failing to stop the Chinese dam under his leadership, which would cause India an "irreparable loss"
 '' arunachal main pasighat ke log 2000 main ai baadh ko yaad karte hai jo tibet main yigang nadi par bane baandh ke tuutane se paidaa hui thi
 It is to be noted that on June 9, 2000, the water level in the Siang River suddenly rose to 30 meters, which drowned almost the entire Pasighat

 At present, China has no plans to divert river water, while concerns have been continuously expressed about it
 china ke yojanakaar lambey samay se mahatvakankshi ''south tu north water diavarjan project'' main ek pashchimi maarg jodgaye par baat karte rahe hai jisase yangtsi nadi kaa 40 arab ghan meter pani uttar ke sookhe ilaakon main bheja ja sakegaa, haalanki is yojana main kahin bhi yaralung jangabo ko shaamil nahin kiya gaya he
 Says Nayan Sharma, Professor, Department of Water Resources Development and Management at IIT Roorkee, "the Chinese plan to dry the Brahmaputra river by building dams will not be true unless the proposed projects are used for non-consumption uses like hydropower
" Will be limited to '' unka anumaan he ki brahmaputra main salanaa pravaah kaa 40 fisadi china main sthit jal-sangrahan kshetra se aata he, lekin is aankade par koi aam sahmati nahin he or sharma anumaanon tathaa aankadon ko ''paryaapt pramanit kiye jane'' kii jarurat par jor dete hai taaki yah tay ho sake ki ''china se ho rahe kitne pravaah par hamaari nirbharta he
 The tributaries of the Brahmaputra that come within the boundary of India also contribute to this flow
 bade baandh banaam chote baandhjankaron kaa kahana he ki nadi ke pravaah kii disha main banane vaale jangamu jaise baandhon kaa uske nichle pravaah par nunatam asar hoga, haalanki china agar kai baandh banane kii apni yojana ko amal main laata he or khaskar great bend vaale baandh ko, tab beshak nichle pravaah samet nadi ke samooche paristhitiki tantra par iskaa dirghakaalik asar dekha jayega
 Tashi Sering, an expert on Tibetan water resources at the University of British Columbia, says that in the case of Dagu, Jishu and Jiyasha projects, China is showing rapid growth, which is 'dangerous'
 ve kehete hai, ''in pariyojnaon ko shuru hue kuch hi varsh hue hai or ve madhya dhara tak pahunch chuki hai
 Gradually it will go down further and eventually reach the Great Bend
 '' ve kehete hai ki great bend par nadi ke pravaah kii disha main baandh banane kaa bhi ''baari asar hoga''
 According to him, "the whole purpose of building a dam on the Great Bend is to exploit the steep slope that rises in the river in a short distance
 jaahir he iske liye pani ko rokna hoga or jalashay bananaa hoga
 In such a situation, there can be no denying that the dam is broken
 '' assam main arunachal kii seemaa par brahmadaputra ke kinare based jile uttari lakhimpur sthit lakhimpur galrs college main vanaspati vigyaan padhaane vaale devajit barua kehete hai, ''baandh ke jariye gaad ko avarodhit karne kaa matlab uske poshak tatwon ko bhi baadhit karnaa hoga jiskaa asar kheti par padegaa
 The dams also disrupt the way fish and other aquatic species move
 ''beijing ke yojanakaaron kaa daawa he ki ye baandh bijli utpaadan ke liye banaae ja rahe hai na ki pani kii dhara ko modeye yaa use ikattha karne ke liye, lihaaja nichle pravaah par inkaa koi pratikul prabhaav nahin hoga
 "these dams will prove beneficial for India," says Zhang
 isse pani kii maatra main santulan paidaa hoga jisase baadh ke maheenon main pravaah kam hoga jabaki sookhe ke maheenon main bad jayega
 "to reinforce his point, he cites the example of the United States, which had asked Canada to build a dam on the upper side of the Columbia River because of its interests
" bharat ke jal sansaadhan mantralay ke adhikari bhi daawa karte hai ki assam main baadh se hone vaali tabaahi ko rokane kaa iklauta rasta brahmaputra par baandh banaaya janaa hi he
 According to calculations done at Pandu near Guwahati, the flow of water in the Brahmaputra is 40,000 cumec in normal season
 baadh ke dauraan yah 69,000 kumake tak pahunch jaataa he
 "if we build a big dam on Siang, it will not only help in controlling floods but will also get additional water in the dry season," says a ministry official
 '' swatantra jaankaron kaa kahana he ki bharat ko apni urja sambandhi jaruraton ke liye panbizli kii sambhaavna ko talashna chahie lekin uttar-purv jaise paryaavarniya rup se najuk ilaake main iskaa sabase badhibia tarika yah he ki vahaan bahuuddeshy chote baandh banaae jaaen
 Dam expert Shyam Kanu Mahant says, "since the northeast falls in Zone-5 on an earthquake-sensitive scale, there will be concern about large dams as they can have devastating effects
" uttar-purv ko bijli chahie or panbizli ek svachh strot he
 In order to minimize the environmental impact, construction of many small dams may provide solutions instead of building large dams

 apni visheshgy-stareey pranali ke madhyam se jahaan bharat kootnithik str par china ko zyada suchanaaen pradaan karne ke liye lagaataar prerit kar rahaa he, vahiin ek hakeekat yah bhi he ki jal bantwaare se sambandhit kisi sandhi ke abhaav main bharat ke paas bhavishya kii pariyojnaon ko rokane ke raste bhi simit hai
 China was one of three countries that voted against the adoption of the United Nations General Assembly's Convention on the Law of the non-navigational Use of International Watercourses in 1997, which aimed to balance the interests of the river's upper and lower flows Had to be established
 bharat ne is sandhi par vot nahin diya tha
 Officials of the Ministry of Water Resources believe that India knows that it cannot stop China from building more dams on Zangbo

 According to officials, India will also get geopolitical benefits in south-east Asia by doing so
 mantralay ke ek adhikari kehete hai, ''bharat myanmar or bangladesh ko bijli bech sakegaa
 This will give it an edge over China in terms of diplomatic and economic relations with both countries
 ''lekin bharat ko aisi pariyojnaayen shuru karne ke liye kam se kam 2016 ke assam vidhansabha chunaav tak pratiksha kerani hogi
 There have been anti-dam protests in the past, due to which the work of 2,000 MW dam on the Subansiri river on the border of assam-arunachal has come to a complete halt
 pichley loksabhaa chunaav se pehle bijepi ne baandh nirmaan kaa virodh kiya tha
 However, last year, when the Union Power Minister Piyush Goyal had said that the construction of the dam would be completed by the central government itself, the leadership of the BJP in the state was dissatisfied
 bijepi is masale ko dobaaraa oochaalnaa nahin chaahegi kyonki nadiyon par banaae ja rahe baandhon ke paryaavarniya prabhaav par yahaan log do hisson main bant chuke hai
 "if we come to power after the 2016 elections, we will build public opinion in favor of the dams," says a top Assam BJP leader
 tab tak is najuk masale ko ham nahin chhuenge
 Sharma says that apart from the obvious benefits to the states facing the power crisis of the north-east, India is also aware of the provision under international law that one country has more right over shared natural resources with the other
 It is considered strong if it is already using these resources
 brahmaputra ke pani kaa istemaal china ne pehle shuru kiya
 If India did not show speed in asserting its claim on the use of its water, it would fall behind in subsequent debates on water sharing under international law
 '' sering kehete hai ki aisi pahal main ek khatra jarur he
 If India starts building dams, China will speed up its projects
 china main aisi pariyojnaon ko nipataane ke pichley record ke maddenjar bharat peeche rah jayega
 They say that by doing this we will also annoy Bangladesh and if we want to develop a joint management system in relation to Brahmaputra Valley with China, then Bangladesh's support will be very important in it
 bharat ke paas behatar tarika yah he ki vah antarrashtriya nadiyon ke zyada sakasham prabandhan ke liye china ko raji kare
 Says Sharma, "the common belief is that China does not do water sharing treaties
 lekin usne mongolia, uttari korea, rus or sabase haal main 2011 main kazakhstan ke saath sandhiya kii hai

 Putting an end to all the speculation, the President of Hindustani Awam Morcha Party (WE) and former Bihar Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi has said that the seat-sharing in the Grand Alliance has not been decided yet
 13 or 14 march ko dilli main hone vaali baithak ke baad 15 march ko siton ke bantwaare kaa elaan ho jayega
 Meanwhile, there were reports that seats had been divided in the mahabandhan
 isamen koi argedy ko 18 seat par to koi 20 siton par chunaav ladava rahaa he
 There is speculation that the Congress will get 10 to 12 seats
 vahiin upendra kushvaha kii party ko 3 or ham party ko 2 seat dene kii baat kahi ja rahi he
 But Jitan Ram Manjhi has clarified that no partition has been done yet
 unhone kaha ki siton ke talmail ko lekar kai round kii baithak ho chuki he
 a meeting was also held in Patna on Monday, but Congress representatives did not attend
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main congress or argedy kaa gathbandhan tha
 In which Congress contested 12 and RJD 27 seats and one seat was left for NCP
 argedy kaa kahana he ki gathbandhan main kai partiyon ke shaamil hone ke kaaran wo 5 se 7 seat chhodane ke liye taiyaar he
 The Congress should also sacrifice in the same proportion i
e
 it should also get 7 or 8 seats
 lekin congress to frontroot par khelnaa chaahati he
 He says that he is now stronger than in 2014, at that time he had four mlas, now there are 27 mlas in the assembly
 congress kaa kahana he ki hamaare paas darbhanga se ladane ke liye karti aaazaad jaise majboot ummidavaar hai, katihaar se tarik anwar he aise main kam siton par chunaav ladane kaa sawaal nahi he
 On the other hand, Jitan Ram Manjhi is facing Congress
 unka kahana he ki sammajanak samjhauta nahin hoga to ham chunaav nahin ladenge
 There is a repeated indication from the Congress that if it does not get respectable seats, then it can also contest the elections alone
 duusari taraf left partiyaan alag se aankh dikhaa rahi hai
 He should get three seats, one of which is Begusarai for Kanhaiya Kumar
 halaki argedy ke rashtriya upaadhyaksh shivanand tiwari ne saaf kaha ki left se koi baatcheet nahi ho rahi he
 So now everyone is eyeing the meeting to be held in Delhi on 13-14

 History has been witness, we artists sometimes get more attention than leaders
 isiilie artiston ko bulaayaa jaataa he
 Instead of leaders
 netaa jhooth zyada bolte hai
 Kumar Vishwas is also speaking a lot
 main narendra modi ji ke saamne lard jaaoongi, nitin gadakari ke saamne lard jaaoongi
 Manoj Tiwari: BJP said, then we will definitely contest
 jahaan se party kahegi
 By the way my village comes to Buxar
 magar vah ilaaka surakshit main aata he
 We did not enter politics with any condition
 narendra modi ko pradhanmantri banane ke liye ham aae hai
 If we fight, one seat increases, then we will be happy
 bas yahi chaah he ki jab baat ho ki modi ko piem banane main kinakaa haath he to ek gilahari kii tarah meraa bhi zikr ho
 Nagma: If the party calls the high command, then i will contest the election
 kisi bade netaa ke khilaaf kahenge, to bhi laduungi
 They have to decide
 main mumbai se hum, to pehle vahiin se seat maangoongi
 If not possible there, i will fight against any veteran
 ye log baar baar rahul or sonia ji par hamale karte hai
 Talk of dynasty
 ye log bhi chunakar hi aate hai
 Raju Srivastava: i campaigned for a lot of parties with money
 congress ke liye
 For BJP
 sari partiyon ke liye
 i was not political then
 mujhe paison kii jarurat thi
 Was not home gaadi kii kist bhi bharani thi
 Then i used to understand that tents, chairs, sound like light
 jis party ke paise aa gaye, usee ke yahaan utar gaye
 i have made this business
 ishwar ne yahi diya mujhe
 Neither did i have much education
 main maanata hum ki jokerai kiya he
 Im gimmicky isi se ghar chalaa rahaa hum
 Has not robbed anyone's house
 kumaar vishwaas:jo hamaare teenon saathi hai
 We were asking for a date of birth before sitting on the cot
 kavi or kalakaar main thodaa antar he
 i reached the iits and iims of the country by writing poetry
 desh kaa sabase mahangaa kavi rahaa
 But even when there were agitations, it came out
 maine padmashri or sahitya academy ke liye nahin likhaa
 If you go somewhere, then the leader who is sitting in front, never insulted him
 magar ab main raajnneetik hum
 i am opposed to what is wrong
 sawaal (kumaar vishwaas se): congress poster banavaa rahi he
 Someone thinks crazy
 koi divaana samajhataa he
 Kumar: Poster was put up in Jagdishpur
 do ke note par meri tasviir
 Rahul Gandhi on 1000 note
 maine kaha, bilkul muqabla nahin
 My father master
 unke baap piem
 i said two's note is not fake
 hajaar kaa kai baar hota he
 Raju: My opponents in Kanpur are also saying what a clown will do for Kanpur
 main kahana chahta hum ki joker hansaaegaa hi, rulayegaa nahin
 Question (from Raju): How will you introduce yourself after filling the form in Kanpur? Raju: Nowadays is the age of the net
 bachche fast hai
 People no longer want to listen to long speeches, speak what is in the heart
 jo khadey hai, baith jaaen
 Those who are sitting, lie down
 ammaa-buaa sab kisi hai
 Went to many mohallas in our Kanpur
 malin basti main
 They have a lower section here
 dost rishtedaaron ne charpai sadak par daal di
 Then Khatiya rose up from the ground
 laga bukamp to nahin aayaa
 When i looked up, two Kanpur-based Suareas were scratching their backs
 naaliyaan bajabajaati rahati hai
 There are many pigs
 unhen pataa hi nahin kitne bachche hai
 Who drank milk kiskaa number hi nahin aayaa
 There is so much electricity problem
 ham pre kar rahe hai
 Do not leave today
 jaise hi wo aae or batan dabaaya
 She came with a loud voice
 jabardastee bol rahe hai, ghar kaa maamla he
 Today it is gone
 jaati nahin kabhi
 Gone after 14 years
 pankhaa upar se hilkar bataa detaa he, jhooth he
 The fan says, i will give air later
 khidki kholo, hawa aane do
 So i am working to raise the problems of the people there with entertainment
 main kisi film star yaa netaa kaa betaa nahin
 Went to Mumbai, then drove auto
 mujhe koi simpathy nahin chahie
 People say don't tell them, don't tell them
 tab auto chalaate vakt sheesha sidhaa kar bolte the
 Brother, sit far and wide
 ham bhi insaan hai
 
 
 Question (from Manoj Tiwari): The identity as an artist
 magar ummidavaar ko jitaane ke liye aapako apane andaaj main kaise kya karnaa hoga?manoj:main dil kii sunata hum
 i have contested from SP last time
 samaajwaad mujhe lubhaata he
 Lohia's policies sound good
 magar jab kahin jate hai or nahin dikhataa to vaapasi kaa rasta lenaa padataa he
 My heart goes out to Modi ji
 main aaj tak kaa divaana hum
 i definitely watch debates
 chaahe 3:30 baje shoot se lautun
 Gave 65 years to Congress
 modi ji ko 5 saal dene chahie
 The rally is crowded
 to uske liye maine ek gaanaa bana liya he
 
 
 Bharat Mata is in agony and this crowd is the victim of suffering
 sara desh pukaar rahaa he ab modi kii jarurat he
 Nothing has to be done separately for the suffering
 dil ne kaha, manoj tiwari agar modi ke saath khadey hote ho, to kai jagah par bain ho jaaoge
 Many government programs are not called
 sawaal: ye sab to immergency main hota tha
 Where is it now? Manoj: It is no longer called in UP
 raju:nahin, aap bahut program kar chuke ho
 That's why Kumar is not calling: Call us Raju
 raju:are aap to upi se hi hai
 Manoj: Oh no brother, there is a difference
 aaj mere paas acha jivan he
 But where life is spent, how to forget them
 to ye najar aayaa ki ek aadmi ne 12 saal main exam paas kiya he
 On the question of fighting SP on a ticket, i went into a clumsy decision
 amar singh ke prabhaav main tha
 He introduced Amitabh Bachchan
 unheen ke saamne puch liya ki chunaav lado
 i could not refuse
 par siikhaa ki ab agar chunaav ladate ho to paanch saal baad bhi hero kii tarah khadey rahanaa padegaa
 Not like Govinda
 sawaal (kumaar vishwaas se): jo khud kehete hai likhte hai, vah dil se nikal rahaa hota he
 You moved to Amethi from here
 sirf naam kaa pratik nahin yah
 The symbol of Rahul Gandhi is, what resonates in your heart, when you reach Amethi? Kumar Vishwas: i did not enter politics because of any halo
 main inase lesar ped aadmi hum
 The first poem was read for 100 rupees
 bina shishe kii roadways bas main chalaa
 Then became the country's most expensive poet
 main 6-7 maheene pehle amethi gaya
 Where Maia ji wins in Rae Bareli and Amethi where bhaiya ji wins
 in donon ke bich jo sadak he, vah gaddhon ke bich sadak he
 In this, 12 pregnant women died in 6 months
 aise ilaake ke saansad kii jamaanat jabt honi chahie
 i thought so isiilie puure desh se logon ko bula rahaa hum
 Let's ask questions manaregaa main peeche
 Back in literacy
 kuposhan main aage
 Everything was in your hands
 aap chaahate ho to teen din main silendar 9 se 12 ho jate hai
 They would have paid a little for those who made it worth it
 amethi kii pidaa ghutan santras likhata hunaajkal amethi kaa itihaas likhata huunsawaal (nagma se): aap 9 bhashaaon kii jaankaar hai
 And the Congress is not even in 9 states
 nagma:main khuda kaa shukr adaa karti hum ki 9 bhashaaon main saxes mili
 Movies are usually a mirror of truth
 kaaphi artiston main deshbhakti bhi hoti he
 Now Kumar Vishwas ji said, i never took money
 main bhi garv se kah sakati hum ki kisi raajnneetik kaam ke liye kabhi ek paisa nahin liya
 Neither will i take it further bhashaaon main bhi jab bhi kaam kiya
 No one works in Hindi and goes to another language
 hindi main maine sab e plus grad main kaam kiya
 Had heard a few days ago, do not think about the big actress in Bhojpuri
 ham hameshaa paise ke liye kaam nahin karte
 Working in Bhojpuri reveals the culture of the place
 maine manoj ji or ravi kishan ji ke saath milakar jo kaam kiya, filmon kaa, vah bhashaa or samskruti kii izzat bhi badhaata he
 As far as ideology is concerned
 secular idology
 My Ideal Nehru is living
 desh ke kaaphi noujvaan unase prerit hote hai
 He always talked about university and diversity
 abhi baar baar chaay kii chaoupal par baat hoti he
 Who does not like to discuss tea or chaupal? magar kya har chaay vaale kii izzat hoti he
 Every little person should be respected
 magar is chaay vaale ko kyon america ne vija nahin diya
 Why does this man want to sympathize
 indira ji ne desh main nahin, vishwa main naam kiya
 Soniaji was the only woman who fought against India Shining
 ladakar unhone apni haisiyat hasil kii he
 He is the party president for 10 years
 manoj tiwari:nagma ji se khush hua main
 She said that she did not get a visa for many days
 haa, sahi he, kanphyus hua, magar ab chet gaya he
 Kumar Vishwas: i agree with Nagma ji
 inhen 9 bhashaaen aati hai
 Congress is thinking the same in all languages
 aapke yahaan demokrasi nahin he
 The son of a big star can come in the industry
 magar jaruri nahin ki chale
 i tell my children to join hands of Priyanka Gandhi's children, i do not know if you become PM after 30 years
 sawaal (kumaar vishwaas se): aap idhar-udhi kii baat kar rahe hai, magar dilli main kashti duubati najar aa rahi he
 Kumar Vishwas: i am happy that for years the opposition parties, who have been building the nation for years, have been opposing Arvind Kejriwal that it has ruined the country in four weeks
 sawaal (raju se): arvind kejariwal ne jin bhrasht netaaon kaa zikr kiya, unamem aapke virdohi mantri shriprakash jaiswal bhi hai
 What would you say to your candidate? Raju: See, the problem of sweep is that it falls apart in a few months
 nagma:main raju kii is baat se sahamat hum
 Manoj: i was very surprised that day the Aam Aadmi Party also compromised with the Congress
 aaj haalat ye he ki vot kisi ko bhi do, sarkaar congress kii banati he
 Kumar Vishwas: i doubt your political sense
 indore main pandit dhaagaa baandhta he
 So he speaks to the dacoit as well
 yani aapkaa kaarobaar bade
 So i went somewhere as a poet, then good things for the guests
 aaj ham bhrashton ke liye kanoon bana rahe hai, to congress daanv pech chal rahi he
 We have not come to change politics
 manoj tiwari:ham kalakaar hai, ham jiske khilaaf bhi honge, use bhi saamne se bolne main takalif hogi
 But my confusions continue on the Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party
 sawaal: zikr robert wadra kaa bhi hua
 
 
 Raju: He is caught in a land scam, it turns out
 land kabjia lete hai
 Last week he accidentally took over his land
 hua yun ki us din koharaa bahut tha
 Kept occupying all night
 savera hua, to mazdooron ne kaha ki sahab ye aapkaa hi he
 Question (from Manoj Tiwari): One person you are praising, he started Gujarat Vibrant in 2007
 tab se ab tak hamane bahut vijual khoje ki kahin chaay kii chuskee dikh jaae
 Did not see ab dikh rahi he
 Is this not a new thing, which Kumar is mentioning that politics will run by road? Manoj: Modi ji accepted a change
 kisi ne kaha ki ye chaay bechney kii aukaat rakhte hai
 It was a statement with a problem
 magar unhone kaha, ham sadak par chalenge
 Will sell tea again
 main us bijepi ko saport kar rahaa hum, jisamen shivaraj chouhan, raman singh, narendra modi or manohar parrikar jaise vyakti hai
 i also have a dream on them
 sapane hi to hai
 There is disappointment in public
 ham bhi vaise hi dekh rahe hai
 If i felt that i could not give it in five years, then what is the need to praise? lag rahaa he ki 12 saal main gujarat main jo test hua
 He will be proved right
 nagma:sapane dekhne main buraai nahin
 The smallest person should get respect
 magar vyakti kii soch or vichaar bhi dekhne chahie
 When the kite flies, it comes to the hindu-muslim sect
 dange ke baad kute ke pille kii baat kii jaati he
 Artist or leader, he should be very sensitive
 agar modi jaisi soch kaa vyakti piem bane to mujhe aapatti he
 Question: The leader has become an artist and the artist has moved into a new role
 raju:raily main modi ne kaha ki gujarat banane ke liye 56 inch kaa seenaa hona chahie
 So i have not seen in humans
 haa daityon or rakshason main hota he
 This type of comparison should not happen
 main bhale hi samaajawaadee party se hum
 But felt bad that no tea person should be insulted
 aisa nahin ki chaay vaale kaa sammaan hi hota rahaa ho
 How are you speaking? chaay le aa be, bhaag be, ab chaay waalon kaa sammaan to badha he
 Speaking of Saifai, there was not always a dance song there
 lok nrity hue
 The painting took place
 ye jaruri hota he
 We get jobs for artists
 kisaan putr rahe hai, shikshak rahe hai, netaa ji
 Question (from Raju): What do you say as an artist, do you remember or forget it when you get into politics? Raju: What was said at that time, just asked to laugh, it was like this Should be taken from nagma:main isse sahamat nahin, kisi ko nicha dikhaakar hansaane ke haq main nahin hum
 Raju: Comedians should get some leeway from society
 nagma:magar wo log jo raajnneeti main dilchaspee rakhte hai, desh main sudhaar laana chaahate hai
 They read the same poems even today
 aaj gaddhon kii baat kar rahe hai
 Kumar Vishwas: i have not written a poem against anyone till date
 aap le aaie
 i will leave Amethi
 ek line khojie, jo kisi dharm, jati yaa ling yaa samaaj ke khilaaf he
 So i will leave public life
 nagma:aapaki party kii mallika sarabhai ne bhi kaha ki aap kabhi auraton kii izzat nahin karte
 Raju: No, he respects women sometimes
 kumaar vishwaas:main madarena or romesh sharma kii tarah nahin hum
 Raju: i did a joke
 asaram ke log naaraaz ho gaye
 Started threats on the phone
 aapako yaad he, saddaam hossain pakade gaye
 So met in the bunker
 lambii lambii dadhi
 This news was coming
 sidhi sadhi mahila dekhakar boli, e bhaiya, ye asaram baapu ko kaahe pakad liye
 i am not saying this mahila kaa kairactor kah rahaa he
 Now the phones started coming
 tumhaari kamedi ghused denge
 Hey, cut this line
 badi musiibat he
 How to laugh kumaar vishwaas:aapane 2003 ke mere video ke liye ab bhavanaaen aahat kin
 Raju: Hey, don't start taking me out somewhere
 kumaar:abhi manoj tiwari ke khilaaf desh kii sari padosne shikaayat karengi
 Next door to life raju:ek din main atal ji kii nakal kar rahaa tha
 In Advani's house
 wo haath mel rahe the, main samaj gaya ki band karnaa he
 The election went to hell
 jo dil main ho rahaa karo
 In which the public is happy
 ye sukhi sukhi party na karo
 Why do we need the US stamp on the issue of public questions? The US only knows how to bully
 nagma-meri aapatti chaay kii chaoupal or aam aadmi vaali baat par he
 It was not said on intention
 ki inhen america ne vija nahin diya
 So there was a reason for this
 masalaa chaay vaala nahin he
 There were comments on their riots
 56 inch kii chaati kii tippanee, jiskaa raajnneeti se koi matlab nahin hota
 i stand by this point
 sawaal (kumaar vishwaas se): aap mahilaon se kis munh se vot maangenge?kumaar:akasar kalakaar chunaav jitkar gaayab ho jate hai
 i have taken home in Amethi
 magar rahul gandhi aaj tak munshiganj guest house se kaam chalaa rahe hai
 They may have smelled of mud there
 raju shrivastav:kanpur main ammaa rahati hai
 Is home peshey ke liye mumbai main rahata hum
 If a man is determined, both things can happen
 jhooth bolte hai log ki nahin chahie paisa
 Lie that Seva Veva
 ham to train main baith jaaen
 Everyone falls behind to tell Gajodhar joke
 isliye flite main baith jate hai
 Kumar Vishwas: For the last 40 years, my senior Surendra Sharma has been telling a joke on his wife
 lekin vah rajeev gandhi ke dost hai
 So nobody says anything
 main chutkule sunaata hum
 i tell you a thousand times
 nagma:abhi kah rahe the, ab inaki jahniyat saamne aa gai
 Kumar Vishwas: Sir, everything good has happened in 67 years
 vah aap laae
 Just say that to you
 
 
 kuch na dikhataa tha andhere main aankh to thiye kisi raushnee ai ki aankh hi chali gaimanoj tiwari:aapaki baat sahi he, magar siddhu ji isi baat ke liye hi lard rahe hai ki unhen amritsar se hi ladaaya jaae
 i am yet to be tested
 koshish rahegi ki paanch saal baad bhi hero banakar hi rahen
 Nagma: Political parties are often dragged by artists
 ve mashhoor hote hai
 Many people also win
 magar south main aap dekhen, mjiaar
 Jayalalithaa, NTR, have been a lot of artists, have also become cms, have been effective
 shatru ji, jaya ji abhi bhi active hai
 This part is not owned by anyone
 jo junun ke saath kaam karnaa chahta he
 Heraju for her: i agree with Nagma
 jo seva sangharsh karnaa chaahe, uske liye acha he
 We also used to do programs for 50-50 rupees
 ab lagata he ki kuch lautaaya jaae samaaj ko
 We should also think about what he did for the country
 brij nahin banavaa sakate, bijli nahin laa sakate
 You can clean the neighborhood garbage
 kanpur main railway crossing band he
 The red lighted train will cross everyone and stand near the gate
 ab inako pucho, saamne vaala trephic kahaan se aayega
 i have many things in my mind
 maine netaa ji se bhi kah deen
 It is not like that the cabinet minister or CM comes to our city, then all the officers leave their department and stand on the helipad like this
 sab apane kaam main hi lage rahen
 And thick necklaces that are worn for hours in meetings
 paanch chah log ghasitkar laate hai
 Then many mundi comes
 to ye haar phool or hajiri kaa culture khatm hona chahie
 Click for full coverage of Panchayat Aaj Tak rahul gandhi kii aaj kii haalat dekhakar ek kahawat yaad aa rahi he
 Choubey had gone to become sixteen, returned as Dubey
 ab dar yah he ki dube banakar laut to aae hai, kahin shube na ban jaaen ab
 No - no, there is no word
 dube ko do se joda gaya
 So i removed two and added zero
 baharhaal, siyasat main yun lene ke dene kyon pad gaye rahul ko, is par kuch guftgu karte hai
 Mayawati, Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, Manmohan Singh and even Narendra Modi for some time
 ye log intervyuu dene se bachate rahe hai
 Mayawati herself confirmed this at the Lucknow rally recently
 safai bhi di ki media main ab bhi manuaadi log hai
 Say something, print something, then keep on cleaning, but the public does not reach
 to ye he bispi supremeo kii vajah
 Neither does she give interviews
 na press conference main sawaal leti hai
 Not only this, the speech is also written in rally and PC
 mayawati ko dikkat nahin he
 Their cadre is tied up and the message reaches him
 magar kya rahul gandhi bhi apane liye yahi baat kah sakate hai
 Is there any Congress cadre left? magar shuru se shuru karen to behatar he
 When Manmohan Singh was not PM, there was no mainstream interest in his interviews
 jab piem bane, to yah sochakar bachate rahe ki kahin unki araajnneetik siio chhavi ko batta na lag jaae
 Because only the questions will be asked politically
 magar phir manmohan ne ek intervyuu diya
 This was the time of the indo-us nuclear deal
 left ke saport se upie-1 chal rahi thi or karaat babu america virodh par ade hue the
 Then Manmohan also decided to be tough on Mulayam
 ek din ek angreji akhbaar kii varisht patrkaar maanini chatarji se kaha ki arsa hua guftgu kiye
 Let's talk about tea
 or phir jo baaten kin, ve chhapin to sidhi garmi kolkata main laalagupha main baithe commeredon tak pahunchi
 Manmohan's interest was satisfied
 vah iske baad bhi bole, magar sansad main yaa phir duusare sarkari manchon par
 Named after the press conference earlier this year
 chuppi ke sawaal par muskuraae or bole, congress ke manch par bolta hum or uttejit bhi hue to bas modi par
 All right, now everyone knows how much the country wants to hear them
 magar gandhi parivaar, vah to yah daawa karata he ki usne desh kii aawaaj suni he
 He is concerned
 rahul gandhi ke hi shabdon main kahen to 3 hajaar saal puraani he ye aawaaj
 This is the voice of Ashok and Akbar
 to phir sonia gandhi kabhi desh ke saamne kyon nahin ain
 It can be said that she continued to communicate through rallies till 2004 and even after that she was not in any official position
 to javabdehi sidhe sidhe nahin thi
 But now how much these bets are going on
 public saaf sidhi baat chaahati he
 Those who are on Raisina Hill want answers from them
 chaliye ek or tark sahi
 Sonia ji's health is no longer good
 to phir sui tikti he rahul gandhi par
 Rahul Gandhi, who had said in the beginning that yes, it is true that i came here easily due to Gandhi family, but now i want to change this system
 to laga tha ki shaayad ab congress badale
 Here the old guard's dominance was broken
 magar ab itane barason baad bas vahi gaanaa yaad aata he
 Everyone promises love, what is the matter
 magar 2014 ke ain pehle team rahul ko samaj aa gaya ki intervyuu jaruri he
 Whether the tearing of the ordinance in the press conference of the press club or the speech of the kurta in the rallies or poisoning the power is poison, the crying mother said, as if throwing a jumla will not work
 phir intervyuu kaa silsilaa shuru hua
 Hindi newspaper Dainik Bhaskar was selected for the first interview
 jisaki uttar pradesh ke alaava sabhi hindi bhashi rajyon ke alaava gujarat or maharashtra main bhi vyapak pahunch he
 But what was the bottom line of this interview? yahi ki party jimmedaari degi (padhein piem kii) to main taiyaar hum
 There were not many uncomfortable questions here and whatever they were, their answers were evasive
 phir bhi agenda kuch had tak set hua
 The interview was discussed the next day
 phir aayaa doosraa intervyuu
 This time, such a group was selected, whose English newspaper is the first in the country in terms of circulation
 jiskaa angreji news channel prime time kaa agenda set karne kaa daawa karata he
 And what happened during this interview
 un sabhi basic sawaalon ke, jinase congress ke is kunwar ko jujhna hi hoga, jawaab puche gaye
 But what was achieved? ise samajhane ke liye vidwaan hone kii jarurat nahin
 Just a glance can be seen by reading Jokes on Twitter or SMS on whatsapp after forwarding
 system shabd kitni baar bolaa gaya
 There was a lot of discussion on this
 har sawaal ke jawaab main artiai, vuman impowerment, loksabhaa main pending chah bilon par baat hui
 Happened and much more
 masalan dangon ke masale par modi ko gherne ke pher main ab rahul khud hi ghir gaye
 Modi's media scrutiny has been going on for 12 years
 or kal upie ke saajheedaar ensipi ke netaa ne kah bhi diya, ab chhodie bhi
 The court acquitted and you are playing the same tune
 par 2002 ke pehle bhi desh main dange hue the
 In 1984
 jab rahul ke papa rajeev piem the
 Rahul said, at that time the state took action
 bijepi ne tathyon kii jhadi lagaate hue aarope lagaaya ki sarkaar sust thi
 The right word was fulfilled by the speech of Rahul's interview, in which he said, showing alleged cleanliness that yes, i think some Congressmen were involved in the riots
 ab sikh sadakon par hai
 Shouting that Rahul and Sonia Gandhi go before the CBI or the court and tell which are the Congressmen who were involved in the riots
 safagoi baari pad gai

 According to a source close to the investigation, during interrogation, Strausskahn told investigators that he had little doubt that the women he met in the party were prostitutes
 unhone kaha ki in mahilaon kaa unase parichay varisht police adhikariyon ne karaayaa tha
 Strosskahn's lawyer, Frederick Baulieu, said, "he explained the whole incident while answering all the questions asked

 For these, a court should be set up in every district, which should be monitored by senior judges
 inke jitne bhi crimanal cese hai, unako de-tu-de hearing kii jaae

 isi film ke nirdeshak vijay bhatta ne mahjabeen bano ko ek nayaa naam diya or tab se wo minaa kumari ke naam se jaani jane lageen
 Badmina Kumari of 'baiju Bawra' produced three hit films till 1953, including Daaira, Do Bigha Zameen and Parineeta

 kamaal se rishte khatm hone ke baad unhone apane dil ke dard ko kaagaj ke pannon par utaarna shuru kar diya tha
 Some Shayari written by Meena - Divorcing with nazar-e-kahar, Jawani too with Meri Do Do Dohar

 Mursi repealed the controversial order granting him broad powers, giving a major indication of the agreement but decided that a referendum on the draft of the new constitution would be scheduled on 15 December
 raashtrapati mursi ne yah naatakeey kadam raajnneetik dalon ke netaaon ke saath ‘rashtriya vaarta’ ke baad uthaaya
 The talks lasted until after midnight

 Despite the order's cancellation, Mursi's decision will not apply from the previous date, which means that decisions made so far since the announcement remain intact and Mursi's decision will be above judicial review
 yah nirnay janamat sangrah or sanvaidhanik ghoshnaa ke khilaaf saptaah bhar ke pradarshan ke baad aayaa he
 These demonstrations led to violent clashes between Mursi's supporters and their opponents
 is sangharsh main kam se kam saat log maare gaye or 700 anya ghayal ho gaye
 Ava said the new announcement would not end Mursi's decisions beyond judicial review but the president still had the responsibility to protect the revolution and its objectives

 com / 33xbej6ja9— Sandeep (@sandeepdalvi84)september 3, 2019 The latest tweet by former Supreme Court Justice Markandey Katju, who is in the news with his statements and tweets, can create a new ruckus in the electoral political environment
 modi sarkaar ke kaam ko lekar katju ne twit kiya, 'ab bas yahi kasar rah gai he ki sarkaar bharat ko pavitra desh (holy country) kaa darja de de
 Katju also gave reasons for this and gave suggestions
 bharat ko holi country kyon banaaya jaae?-yahaan ganga narmada jaisi pavitra nadiyaan bahati hai
 Sacred books like the Veda Purana, Ramayana Mahabharata, were written
 -gaay pavitra pashu he, jisaki raksha ke naam pardhongi baabalog janata ko thagte hai
 Ram, Krishna, Mahavira was born here and Buddha got knowledge here
 -duniya kaa sabase bada mela kumbh bhi to isi pavitra desh main lagata he
 Holy cities like Ayodhya, Mathura, Kashi, Kanchi Puri, Haridwar, Madurai are here
 ab to amritsar or anandpur ko bhi pavitra shaharon kaa darja mil saktaa he
 Katju gave these suggestions - Raghupati Raghav Rajaram should be declared a national anthem
 -india get kii zamindoj kar 100 feet oonchi bhagwaan ram kii pratimaa banavaa di jaae
 There should be a statue of Gomata on the main square of every city, which should be looked after by the guard
 unhen goraksha ke naam par kuch bhi karne kaa akhriyaar ho
 National greetings to the nation Jai Shri Ram
 -saare purush gerua vastra pahane or kanth main rudraksh kii maala bhi
 - Women must wear ocher sari and veil so as to avoid the evil eye of others
 -hanuman chalisa gayan se puure desh main din kii shuruyaat ho, yani bhor se hihanuman chalisapath shuru ho jaae
 India is the second largest mobile market in the world, that is why you can see many smartphones and smartphone companies here
 haalanki desh kii apni telecom company reliance jeeyo ne jiophone or jiophone 2 ke jariye bharat main feechar phone bazaar ko alag tareeke se target kiya
 Jio already has a very high market share in feature phones and a new report is hinting that the company may launch a new smartphone
 is smartphone ko july main AGM ke dauraan launch kiya ja saktaa he
 Speaking to the beetelbite News website, a Jio official said that the company can launch Android-based smartphones during the AGM in July this year
 is report main ye bhi jaankaree di gai he ki is smartphone main 5-inch tachascreen disple hoga or ye android oriyo (go adishan) par chalegaa
 Also, this smartphone will be costlier than jiophone 2 and will be priced around $ 63 (about Rs 4,500)
 yadi ye khabar sach nikalati he to jiophone or jiophone 2 ke baad se ye company kii ore se ek bada kadam hoga
 Because till now the company has launched only feature phones with alphanumeric and QWERTY keyboards and has not introduced a single smartphone in the market
 company ke donon feechar phone popular bhi kaaphi hai or nae smartphone ko bhi bazaar main acchhee safalataa mil sakati he
 In such a situation, companies like Xiaomi present in the budget segment will have to face stiff competition
 philhal jeeyo ke nae smartphone ke chipset kii jaankaree nahin di gai he, lekin isamen 2GB ram or 64GB storage diya ja saktaa he
 Also, support for memory cards can also be provided here
 praapt jaankaree ke mutabik yahaan photography ke liye 5 megapixl rier camera or front main selfi ke liye 2 megapixl kaa camera diya ja saktaa he
 If launched jiophone 3, then it will compete with Android Go based Samsung Galaxy J2 Core (go Edition) and the soon to be launched Redmi Go smartphone in India

 The 28 ships that the US Treasury Department has banned and the 27 companies associated with shipping are registered in North Korea, China and Singapore
 america ne uttar korea ke parmaanu or missile kaarykram ko rokane ke liye yah karrwai kii he
 However, this action by the Trump administration may deepen tensions between the two countries once again

 Earlier in August and June, the Trump administration also banned Russian and Chinese companies supporting North Korea's missile program

 raipur loksabhaa seat par is baar kul 25 ummidavaar chunaav maidan main hai
 Earlier in 2014, Ramesh Bais of Bharatiya Janata Party had won from Raipur Lok Sabha seat and Congress candidate Satya Narayan Sharma had to face a crushing defeat
 pichley loksabhaa chunaav main ramesh bas ko 6 lakh 54 hajaar 922 vot mili the, jabaki congress ke satya narayan sharma ko 4 lakh 83 hajaar 276 voton se santosh karnaa padaa tha

 He had garnered 3 lakh 64 thousand 943 votes and defeated Bhupesh Baghel
 isamen bhupesh baghel ko sirf teen lakh 7 hajaar 42 vot mili the
 Apart from this, in the 2004 Lok Sabha elections, Ramesh Bais had won the BJP ticket and Shyamcharan Shukla of the Congress had to face defeat

 However, this image is slowly changing
 kyonki ispaat, cement, aluminium or bijli udyogon kii khaasi maujuudagi ke chalate raipur vanijyik or audyogic centre banataa ja rahaa he
 Raipur district is also important from historical and archaeological point of view
 yah jila kabhi dakshini kaushal kaa hissaa tha or maury samrajya ke adheen mana jaataa tha
 The city of Raipur has long been the capital of the Haihaya kings, saving the traditional forts of Chhattisgarh

 Shiva Thapa's shocking defeat: Thapa, who won a bronze medal in the World Championship in the lightweight final, suffered a shocking defeat at the hands of Manish
 thapa ne kaaphi saavdhaan shuruyaat kii or kuch achche panch lagaae
 But in the second round, Manish hit many fine hooks and uppercuts
 jisaki vajah se thapa kaa aatmavishvaas hill gaya
 a hit from Thampan's eye over Thapa's eye also caused a cut above Thapa's eye and that was why the referee had to stop the fight
 muqabla phir se shuru hua to thapa apane 100 fisadi lay main nahin the lekin vah puri tarah hathiyaar daalane ko bhi taiyaar nahin the
 The third and final round was very tight

 gujarat main bijepi ko gherne ke liye is baar congress nai ranneeti ke saath utarane kii taiyaari kar rahi he
 In 2003, 2008 and 2013, Modi has consistently defeated Congress as Chief Minister
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main modi ko pradhanmantri ke ummidavaar bane to gujarat ne 26 kii 26 siten bijepi kii jholii main daal di
 Now the Congress feels that with the resentment of Patel society, anti-incumbency wave of BJP government for almost 18 years, Modi's right to be Chief Minister can go to him
 haalanki ek dar he jo congress ko sata rahaa he
 That is, of communal polarization
 darasal, congress maanati he ki gujarat ke vidhansabha chunaav rahe hon yaa 2014 kaa loksabhaa chunaav rahaa ho yaa phir haal main upi kaa vidhansabha chunaav, in sab main bijepi kii safalataa kii badi vajah hindu- muslim maton kaa bantwaaraa bhi bani
 The Congress is now learning from the Bihar Assembly elections and is preparing to enter the Gujarat Assembly elections
 chunaav main dhruvikaran naa hone paae isliye congress ne gujarat ke liye khaas plan taiyaar kiya he
 The plan has been kept so secret that neither Congress leaders are openly talking about it nor will they have any open role in this plan
 congress ke ranneetikaar parde ke peeche se is ranneeti ko anjaam denge
 According to the 'peace plan' prepared sources, the Congress is trying to execute a 'peace plan' in Gujarat
 congress ke netaaon ne alpsankhyak samaaj ke jane maane aise logon kii suchi taiyaar kar lee he, jinaki apane ilaake ke samaaj main paith hai
 With them, small groups of serious people have been formed and their work has been explained to them
 ye grupamuslimlaakon main chupchaap, bina shor sharabe ke jaaenge
 They will explain to the people that they should not be aggressive during the election and do not get into any provocation
 matdaan ke din khaas taur par hallaa-huddang karke vot dene naa jaaen
 Vote quietly in the usual way
 hindu- musalmaan ke bich vaimnasy failaa sakane vaali kisi ghatana par pratikriya naa den
 Overall, the Congress is trying to repeat the same in Gujarat as polarization between Hindu and Muslim votes has been stopped
 sutron ke mutabik, congress ko yah bhi lagata he ki pichley chunaav main aakhir main modi ne sidhe miyaan ahamed patel kahkar dhruvikaran kiya tha
 While those CM candidates were not far away
 abaki baar bhi congress ko dar he ki jis tarah ahamed patel ne modi or amit shah kii kilabandi ko bhedate hue rajyasabha kaa chunaav jeeta, uske baad bijepi aakhri maukey par ye baat kah sakati he ki congress miyaan ahamed patel ko balldor se gujarat kaa siem bananaa chaahati he
 To cut this bet, Ahmed Patel himself has decided that he will clear again and again in every speech and interview that he was neither a CM candidate, nor is he and he will not be
 gujarat main lagaataar modi ke haathon harati ai congress abaki baar is naai tir ko bhi aajamaane kii taiyaari kar rahi he
 Actually, only the people of Gujarat will tell whether this arrow will hit the target or not

 This success of India is the result of 10 years of hard work

 The first proposal was made by the Manmohan government in 2009 at the United Nations

 In 2017, India proposed the third time together with these countries
 iske baad 2019 main france kii aguwai main phir se pratibandh parishad main prastaav rakhaa
 Every time China used the veto to save Masood Azhar
 is baar china ke vito ko france, america or britain ne apni tauheen ke taur par liya
 After this, China withdrew its veto

 a proposal was brought in the United Nations to freeze his assets and ban his travel
 is par china ne vito laga diya

 bharat ko sanyukt raashtra ke teen sthaayee sadsy deshon america, britain or france kaa samarthan bhi tha, lekin china ne phir vito laga diya

 28 march, 2019-france or britain kii madad se america ne masood ajahar ko bluekalysted karne ke liye sanyukt raashtra kii suraksha parishad main maujuuda pesh kiya
 April 3, 2019 - China accuses the US of threatening to use 'all available resources'
 china ne kaha ki washington kaa kadam is mudde ko jatil bana rahaa he
 It is not conducive to peace and stability in South Asia
 30 april, 2019-china ne kaha ki sanyukt raashtra main masood ajahar ko vaishvik aatankwaadi ghoshit karne ke prastaav par baatcheet jari he
 Hopefully this issue will be resolved properly

 At the same time, Shiv Sena has now reacted to the statement given by Savarkar's name
 shivasena netaa sanjay raut ne kaha he ki saavarkar sirf maharashtra ke nahin, balki puure desh ke hai
 Savarkar should be respected
 nehru-gandhi kii tarah saavarkar ne bhi desh ke liye apana jivan laga diya
 There is a need to honor every such hero
 shivasena netaa sanjay raut ne kaha ki vir saavarkar puure desh ke liye bhagwaan kii tarah hai, maharashtra ke liye nahin
 There is self-respect in the name of Savarkar, as well as the country is proud

 We should respect people like every such god

 While the Congress always surrounds the National self-service Association and the BJP on Savarkar, the Shiv Sena has come to regard Savarkar as a great man

 Two major festivals are celebrated prominently in Islam
 ek id-ul-fitr to doosraa id-ul-ajaha
 eid-ul-azha will be celebrated in India on September 2 this year
 id-ul-ajaha ke maukey par muslim samaaj namaaj padhane ke saath-saath jaanwaron kii qurbaani bhi detaa he
 It is the Sunnah of Hazrat Ibrahim Alaihissalam, according to Islam, which Allah has bestowed upon Muslims
 darasal qurbaani kaa silsilaa id ke din ko milakar teen dinon tak chalata he
 Muslim society sacrifices for the cause of Allah
 halaal tareeke se kamaaye hue dhan se qurbaani jaij maani jaati he, haraam kii kamai se nahin
 Islamic Importance of Qurbani According to Mufti Ejaz Arshad Kasami, Qurbani has a great importance in Islam
 islam ke maddenjar allaah ne hazrat ibrahim alaihissalam ko apni sabase pyaari cheez ko qurbaan karne kaa aadesh diya
 Hazrat Ibrahim Alaihissalam had Aulad Naseeb at the age of 80
 aise main unke liye sabase pyaare unke bete hazrat ismil alaihissalam the
 This was a test for Ibrahim Alaihissalam, in which on one side was the command of Allah and on the other side was the love of the son
 aise main unhone allaah ke hukum ko chunaa or bete ko allaah kii raja ke liye qurbaan karne ko raji ho gaye
 As a sacrifice on Sahib status, Hazrat Ibrahim felt that his feelings should not come in the way of sacrificing his son
 isiilie unhone apni ankhon par pattee baandh lee thi
 When Ibrahim Alaihissalam fired a knife to cut the neck of his son Ismail Alaihissalam, a Dumba (an animal) was introduced in place of Ismail Alaihissalam by Allah's command
 ibrahim alaihissalam ne jab aankh se pattee hataai to unhone apane putr ko apane saamne jinda khadaa paaya
 Allah liked this style so much that he made a right to sacrifice on every honor
 vaazib kaa mukaam ferj se thik neeche he
 If despite being a civil servant, no person has sacrificed, then he is guilty
 aise main jaruri he ki qurbaani kare, mahange or saste jaanwaron se iskaa koi sambandh nahin he
 According to whom Qurbani is Wajibislam, that person is Sahib status, on which Zakat is duty
 vah shaks jiske paas saadhe saat tola sona yaa phir saadhe 52 tola chaandi he yaa phir uske hisaab se paise
 According to today, if you have 28 to 30 thousand rupees, then you are in the realm of silver 52 and a half
 iske mutabik jiske paas 30 hajaar rupee ke kareeb hai us par qurbaani vaazib he
 It becomes necessary to sacrifice on the occasion of eid-ul-azha
 qurbaani kaa makhsadamufti kaasmi ke mutabik islam main jaanwaron kii qurbaani dene ke peeche ek makasad he
 Allah is aware of the condition of hearts
 aise main allaah har shaks kii niyat ko samajhataa he
 When the person obeyed Allah, he only sacrifices for the King of Allah, he gets the King of Allah
 baavjood iske agar koi shaks qurbaani mahaj dikhaave ke taur par karata he to allaah uski qurbaani kubul nahin karata
 The three parts of sacrifice are different parts of the animals that are meant for sacrifice
 jahaan bade jaanwaron par saat hisse hote hai to vahinbakre jaise chhotejanwaron par mahaj ek hissaa hota he
 It is clear that if a person sacrifices a buffalo or a camel, then seven people can be included in it, while the goat gives it, it will be in the name of only one person
 qurbaani ke gosht ke teen hisse karne kii sharia main salaah he
 One part should be extended to the poor, the other part should be used for their friend Ahbab and the third part should be used in their house
 garibon main gosht baantnaa mufeed he
 Avoid sacrificing banned animals, according to Mufti Arshad Kasami, sacrifice only those animals that the law allows and do not sacrifice animals that are banned by the government

 Wicket-keeper Mahendra Singh Dhoni will remain a part of the team until the 2019 World Cup, because the young wicketkeepers who have been tried in the team are not even around this former captain
 cricket chayan samiti ke adhyaksh emesake prasad ne aisa kaha he
 It is now clear from Prasad's views that Delhi captain Rishabh Pant has now fallen from the selectors' list of selectors and 32-year-old Dinesh Karthik is playing the second wicketkeeper in the team
 prasad se jab poocha gaya ki kya vah dhoni ke pradarshan ko siries dar siries dekh rahe he to unhone kaha, ‘ham bharat-e ke daure se kuch wicketciparon ko taiyaar kar rahe hai, lekin hamane kamobesh vishwacap tak dhoni ke saath bane rahane kaa faisla kiya he or iske baad ham inamen se kuch wicketciparon ko taiyaar karne par kaam shuru karenge
 "while watching the match, did Rohit understand the meaning of this gesture? This former wicketkeeper of the Indian team praised Dhoni," i think Dhoni is still the number one wicketkeeper in the world and we always say that Live

 Prasad said, "except Indian cricket, there is no wicketkeeper around Dhoni even in world cricket
 ’prasad kii baton se pant or sanju samson jaise wicketciparon ko jhatka lag saktaa he jo dhoni ke baad qatari main khadey hai
 He said, 'to be fair, these players have not yet reached the level they were expected to
 ham unhen abhi bhi bharat ke e daure kii team main jagah denge or dekhenge ki ve apane pradarshan main sudhaar kar pate he yaa nahin
 ' ab metro yatriyon ko apane yatra smart cards richarge karne ke liye kataron main khadey hokar intjaar nahin karnaa hoga
 Delhi Metro has installed its first automatic top-up machine and more such machines will be installed in the future
 dilli metro ne shuukravaar ko kaha, 'pehali aid value (top-ap) mashin kendriya sachivalay metro stesan par lagaai gai he
 The machine is equipped with touch-screen and passengers can recharge their smart cards through it to avoid long queues
 'dilli metro ke mutabik pareekshan aadhaar par keval kendriya sachivalay metro stesan par hi aid value mashin lagaai gai he
 After seeing the reaction of the passengers, such machines will also be installed at other metro stations
 dilli metro ke mutabik 'yah ek atm mashin kii tarah hi kaam karegi

 Nitish Kumar: Arre isme kaunsi khabar hai? # pollresults— ANI (@ani_news)december 23, 2014 The fourth phase of the Jharkhand assembly elections has been completed for the fifth phase of Jharkhand's political battle, Hemant Soren and many veterans, now the fifth and 16 seats of Akhri phase are to be voted on December 20
 is charan main ek maujuuda vidhayak ko chhod sabhi chunavi maidan main hai
 At this stage, Hemant Soren, the executive president of JMM, is under fire test and the credibility of Luis Marandi and Randhir Singh, two ministers of the Raghuvar Das government, is at stake
 iske alaava purv mantri pradeep yadav or purv spikar alamgir alam main siyaasi pariksha honi he
 Voting on these 16 seats on 20 December, in the fifth phase of Jharkhand, on 20 December, in Rajmahal, Borio, Barhat, Littipara, Pakur, Maheshpur, Shikaripada, Nala, Jamtara, Dumka, Jama, Jarmundi, Sarath, Pouriahhat, Godda and Mahgama seats
 Will go in 16 siton par kul 237 pratyaashee kismat aajamaa rahe hai
 Hemat Soren's prestige bets Hemant Soren, executive chairman of JMM, has contested from two seats Berberhat and Dumka
 pichley chunaav main bhi wo inhi donon siton se chunavi maidan main utre the, lekin dumka seat se wo haar gaye the
 While Barhet won the seat and reached the Assembly and became the Leader of the Opposition in the House
 is baar jeemem pramukh in donon seat par jeet ke liye apni puri takat jhonk di he
 However, the BJP has created a tremendous cycle against Hemant Soren by taking down Luis Marandi from Dumka and Simone Malto from Barhet
 in diggajon kii bhi agniparikshamaujuuda vidhayak kii baat karen to keval littipada se vidhayak simon marandi hi is baar chunaav nahin lard rahe hai
 He has fielded his son Dinesh William Marandi on the JMM ticket
 jabaki, baaki sabhi vidhayak apni-apni siton ko bachaane ke prayaas main is baar bhi chunaav maidan main hai
 Among the current legislators, Tala Marandi, this time after getting a ticket from BJP, has entered the electoral arena on the ticket of AJSU
 baaki apane-apane dal se hi chunaav lard rahe hai
 jmm's hold on six seats, 16 assembly seats of the fifth phase are being held
 ye sabhi siten santhal pargana kshetra main aati he, jo jeemem kaa majboot garh mana jaataa he
 That is why in 2014, JMM won 6 out of these 16 seats
 vahiin, paanch siten bijepi ko mili thi
 The Congress won three seats and the JVM two
 pichley chunaav main jeetne ke baad jeviem ke vidhayak randhir party chhod kar bijepi main shaamil ho gaye the or raghuvar sarkaar main mantri banane main kaamyaab rahe the
 This time he is a candidate from Sarath on BJP ticket

 Apart from this, the Congress has Jamtara, Pakur and Jarmundi seats, while JVM holds Podiahat and Sarath seats

 But arms procurement will be in the interest of the country
 meredesh kaa hitsarvopari hoga
 After this there are some issues which can be considered
 'yechuri ne bhi panaji main samvaadadaataaon se baatcheet kii thi or maang kii thi ki parrikar ko isroyal ke saath hathiyaaron kaa sauda roak dena chahie

 bihar main aagaamee vidhansabha chunaav nitish kumaar banaam narendra modi hoga
 Although a formal announcement is yet to be made, the leaders of every camp from the BJP center to Bihar are convinced that this is the best option for the party and for them
 nitish kumaar ke naam kii ghoshnaa ke baad is baat ke kayaas lagaae ja rahe the ki bijepi kise apana cheharaa banaaegi, lekin bijepi ke sutron ke mutabik, aisa mana ja rahaa he ki vartmaan rajnatik paripekshya main pradhanmantri narendra modi se behatar koi cheharaa nahin ho saktaa
 However, when the party's Bihar incharge and Union Minister Anant Kumar announced to contest elections in Bihar in the name of Narendra Modi, not only Anant Kumar but senior BJP leader and most powerful contender for the post, Sushil Modi publicly announced it
 Denied
 lekin anant kumaar agar apni baat se mukare to uske peeche kaaran bataaya ja rahaa he ki party adhyaksh amit shah is baat kii ghoshnaa filhal nahin karnaa chaahate
 He wants the formalities to discuss the issue in the party's parliamentary party to be completed
 lekin sansadeey dal is vishay par kab vichaar vimarsh karegaa, yah koi nahin jaanata
 But the question is why the party does not want to declare one person, especially Sushil Modi, as the chief ministerial candidate against Nitish Kumar? The reasoning behind this is that the announcement of Modi's name in Bihar will intensify factionalism in the party and many leaders and their supported castes will not be in as aggressive an election for the party as it is in the name of Prime Minister Modi Can
 or pradhanmantri modi ke naam par bihar ke har sansad, mantri or susheel modi se naaraaz rahane vaale netaa man se chunaav main kaam karenge, bhale in netaaon ko bhi maaloom he ki bahumat aane par pradhanmantri modi kii pehali pasand susheel modi hi honge
 Apart from this, BJP may be the biggest party in Bihar, its allies like Lok Janashakti Party, Rashtriya Lok Samata Party are demanding that they should be more benefited if they go to Bihar Assembly elections in the name of Prime Minister Modi rather than Bihar BJP
 Can
 kendriya mantri upendra kushvaha ne iske liye maang kii he ki agar netaa kaa chayan karnaa ho to bijepi apane sabhi sahyogiyon ke saath vichaar vimarsh kar netaa tay kare
 But if there is a strategy to go to the polls in the name of Prime Minister Modi, then there can be no better option than that
 tippaniyan In fact, bjp's allies are happy with the alliance of lalu-nitish-congress because ever since Nitish Kumar's candidature for the post of Chief Minister has been approved, suddenly the BJP leadership especially national president Amit Shah has started giving him a sense
 or in sahyogi dalon kaa maananaa he ki agar lalu-nitish gathbandhan nahin hota to shaayad bijepi unhen nazarandaaj kar chalati or siton ke talmail par bhi wo manamaani karti jisaki sambhaavna ab kaam ho gayi he
 On the other hand, Rashtriya Janata Dal President Lalu Yadav has asked BJP whether BJP is such a dynasty party which does not have a candidate for the post of Chief Minister
 janata daal united netaa or mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne bhi chutki lee he ki bihar bijepi ke kisi netaa ko mukhyamantri pad kaa ummidavaar na bananaa party kii ghor niraashaa kii maansikta darshata he
 After the announcement of Nitish Kumar's name, there were speculations about who would make the BJP its face, but according to BJP sources, it is believed that in the current political context there can be no better face than Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 
 haalanki, party ke bihar prabharee or kendriya mantri anant kumaar ne jab bihar main narendra modi ke naam par chunaav ladane kii ghoshnaa kii to na keval anant kumaar balki bihar bijepi ke varisht netaa or is pad ke sabase prabal daavedaar susheel modi ne saarvajanik rup se iskaa khandan kiya
 But if Ananth Kumar stands by his point, then the reason behind it is being told that party president Amit Shah does not want to announce this
 vah chaahate hai ki party ke sansadeey dal main is mudde par charchaa kii aupchaarikta puri kar lee jaae
 But no one knows when the parliamentary party will discuss this subject
 lekin sawaal he ki party nitish kumaar ke khilaaf kisi ek vyakti khaskar susheel modi ko mukhyamantri kaa umidavaar kyon nahin ghoshit karnaa chaahati? iske peeche yahi tark diya ja rahaa he ki bihar ke modi ke naam kii ghoshnaa hone se party main gutbaji or tej hogi or kai netaa or unki samarthit jatiyaan party ke liye chunaav main utani aakraamak mudra main nahin rahenge jitna wo pradhanmantri modi ke naam par rah sakate hai
 And in the name of Prime Minister Modi, every parliamentarian, minister of Bihar and the leaders who are angry with Sushil Modi will work in the election in mind, even though these leaders also know that Sushil Modi will be the first choice of Prime Minister Modi if majority comes
 iske alaava bihar main bijepi bhale sabase badi party ho, iske sahyogi bhi jaise lok jaanshakti party, rashtriya lok samta party maang kar rahi hai ki bihar bijepi kaa koi cheharaa na hokar pradhanmantri modi ke naam par bihar vidhansabha chunaav main jane par unhen zyada laabh ho saktaa he
 Union Minister Upendra Kushwaha has demanded that if the leader is to be selected, then the BJP should decide the leader in consultation with all its allies
 lekin agar pradhanmantri modi ke naam par chunaav main jane kii ranneeti banati he to usase acha koi vikalp nahin ho saktaa
 The comments darasal bijepi ke sahyogi lalu-nitish-congress ke gathbandhan se khush hai kyonki jab se nitish kumaar ke mukhyamantri pad kii ummidavaari par muhar lagi he, achaanak bijepi netritv khaskar rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah unhen ab bhav dene lage hai
 And these allies believe that if there was no lalu-nitish coalition, then perhaps the BJP would have ignored them and they would have been arbitrary even on the coordination of seats, which is now likely to work
 udhar rashtriya janata dal adhyaksh lalu yadav ne bijepi se poocha he ki kya bijepi aisi nirvansh party he jiske paas mukhyamantri pad kaa ek umidavaar nahin
 Janata Dal United leader and Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has also quipped that not making a Bihar BJP leader a chief ministerial candidate reflects the party's pessimistic mindset
 haalanki, party ke bihar prabharee or kendriya mantri anant kumaar ne jab bihar main narendra modi ke naam par chunaav ladane kii ghoshnaa kii to na keval anant kumaar balki bihar bijepi ke varisht netaa or is pad ke sabase prabal daavedaar susheel modi ne saarvajanik rup se iskaa khandan kiya

 com / pzusczrdl1 HS Phoolka became the Leader of Opposition in Punjab in March 2017, but shortly after, he resigned from the post of Leader of the Opposition saying that he wanted to focus on the 1984 case
 haal hi main guru granth sahib se hui brudabi ke maamle main punjab sarkaar ke deele ravaiyye ke virodh main unhone vidhayaki se bhi istipha de diya tha
 Phoolka was not seen in Aam Aadmi Party meetings for a long time
 yahi nahin phulka ne saarvajanik taur par kaha tha ki agar aam aadmi party kaa congress se gathbandhan hua to main istipha de duungaa
 However, now the Aam Aadmi Party is not going to have an alliance with the Congress and the party has decided to contest all the Lok Sabha seats of Delhi Punjab and Haryana
 aise main sawaal yah uthta he ki aakhir kyon phulka ne aam aadmi party se istipha diya he? sambhaavna yah he ki jab eches phulka naa netaa vipaksh rahe naa hi vidhayak rahe or party alaakaman se unki koi khaas kareebi bhi nahin rahi, balki party ke saath unke matbhed zyaada rahe to aise main party main rahakar wo karte bhi kya? phulka kaa naam 1984 hinsa peediton ko insaaf dilaane ke liye janaa jaataa he
 But when he fights as a leader of a party, then people see his efforts from a political perspective as well
 party se judane se ab unako koi faaydaa nahin
 By this, Sikhs will fight for the society if they break away from the good party and more credibility will be created
 is samay aam aadmi party kii punjab main haalat karaab he
 The party is undergoing tremendous internal fighting
 jabaki haal hi main 1984 sikh virdohi hinsa maamle main congress netaa sajjan kumaar ko aaajeevan karawas kii sajaa dilwakar phulka kaa naam ab or bada ho gaya he
 In such a situation, it may be that Phoolka no longer needs the Aam Aadmi Party brand or the purpose for which he joined the Aam Aadmi Party is now in a position to achieve it without a party
 eches phulka ne kai baar yah zikr kiya tha ki dilli kii arvind kejariwal sarkaar ne 1984 ke hinsa peediton ke liye ummid ke mutabik kaam nahin kiya
 Neither did the victim families get compensation nor did they give jobs
 sambhaavna he ki phulka ke man main ye tis ho jo ab jaakar baahar ai
 On 21 December, the Aam Aadmi Party passed a resolution demanding withdrawal of Bharat Ratna from former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in the Delhi Assembly
 daleel yah di gai thi ki rajeev gandhi ne 1984 main sikhon ke katleam ko jaij tehraaya tha, lekin baad main aam aadmi party is baat se palat gai
 Whereas on 31 December Phulka expressed her opinion about Rajiv Gandhi
 phulka ne twit kar kaha tha ki, 'rajeev gandhi ne sajjan kumaar ko bina kisi jaanch ke clinit di thi
 On 7 November 1984, the opposition leader met Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and said that Sajjan Kumar and other Congress leaders were involved in the 1984 Sikh massacre
 congress ne media ko bataaya- koi congress netaa shaamil nahin
 Any investigation
 congress adhyaksh hone ke naate rahul gandhi ko desh ko jawaab dena chahie
 Why did Rajiv Gandhi save Sajjan Kumar? It is likely that Phoolka had differences on this issue, after which he resigned

 The hearing on the charges against Home Minister p Chidambaram in the 2G case was deferred
 ab ye sunwaayee 8 november ko hogi
 This hearing is to be held on the allegations of Janata Party President Subramanian Swamy
 swami ne chidambaram par aarope lagaae hai ki 2008 main jab wo vitt mantri the or spectrum kii bikri ko lekar tay keemton par unhone bhi koi dhyaan nahin diya
 If he wanted, he could have stopped the mess
 udhar ravivaar ko janata party adhyaksh subramanyam swami ne daawa kiya ki 2ji spectrum ghotaale main 10 se 12 log or shaamil rahe hai lekin maamle main jaanch ke daayre se ab bhi baahar hai
 Swamy said that the investigation is going in the right direction but he feels that the CBI is not questioning some specific people
 unhone samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ‘main apni ore se is maamle main is tarah se kaam karunga ki sibiai ko in logon ko bhi jaanch ke daayre main laane ke liye baadhya kar duungaa
 ' mahendra singh dhoni ke achaanak captaini chhodane ko lekar kai tarah ke khulaase ho rahe hai
 According to the Hindustan Times newspaper, Dhoni was pressurized to give up the captaincy
 unhone apni marji ne captaini nahin chodi he
 Dhoni relinquished India's ODI and T20 captaincy on January 4
 dhoni ne dabaav main chodi captainidhoni ke captaini chhodane ko lekar liye gaye faisle se har koihairanhai
 After considering the mail that was sent to the BCCI on 4 January, everyone feels that they have left the captaincy under pressure
 board ko bheje mail main dhoni ne likhaa tha, ‘main istife kii peshkash karata hum or viraat kaa menter banane ke liye taiyaar hum
 'what is the truth behind Dhoni's captaincy? BCCI Chief Selectors MSK Prasad met MS Dhoni during the match between Jharkhand and Gujarat in Nagpur and in the evening Dhoni resigned from the captaincy
 iske kuch der baademeske prasadka bayaan aayaa 'main dhoni ke celut karata hum, captaini chhodane kii unki timming sahi he
 They know that Virat Kohli is ready after a great performance in a Test match
 dhoni test main khud ko gajab ke captain ke rup main sabit kar chuke hai
 If the BCCI sources are to be believed, then in September, the entire outline to give Kohli captaincy was prepared
 chif selectors emesake prasad or bisisiai ke siio rahul johari ne is bare main kai baar dhoni se kai baar baat kii thi kii ab 2019 ke world cap ko dhyaan main rakhte hue team taiyaar karne kaa vakt aa gaya he
 Viratvirat Kohli, who has been a hit in the 'test' of the Test, has consistently given good results in the Test series
 vanade or tii 20 main bhi unhen kaman saunpane kii charchaa tej ho gai thi
 Only then did Dhoni decide to relinquish the captaincy
 dhoni ne unase kaha ki wo team main badlaav ke liye taiyaar hai
 Also, Virat Kohli and the team will also prepare for this big tournament to be held in England
 dhoni ne is dauraan teenon formet main ek hi captain hone kii baat kii bhi pairvi kii
 Under pressure, Dhoni has done poorly under Dhoni's captaincy in the last few matches

 Still he will discuss this with them
