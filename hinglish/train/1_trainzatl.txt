 The entire intersection was stunned as soon as the shoe was thrown at Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi at the road show in Sitapur
 ganimat thi ki juuta rahul ko nahin laga or wo jitin prasad ke haath se takaraakar neeche ja gira
 a young man was caught, about 40 meters away, and a movement appeared, where a 25-year-old man was caught by the mob and handed over to the police
 pakad main aate hi is ladke ne jor-jor se bolnaa shuru kiya ki 60 saal se desh ko barbaad kiya or ab kisaanon kii yaad aa rahi he
 This young man is a journalist of a rural newspaper, who threw his shoe on Nerahul Gandhi
 is harakat se sann espiji ye khangaalane main jute gai ki aakhir ye shaks he koun
 It was found out that this boy's name is Hariom Mishra and is a resident of Sitapur city
 ye kisi chote gramin akhbaar kaa patrkaar bhi he, jiskaa ycard bhi uske paas se mila
 The man repeatedly referred to himself as a journalist and referred to the poor tenure of the Congress
 rahul gandhi kii baat sahi sabit karne main jute congressijuta chalane ke baadaraahul gandhi sitapur ke hi agle chauraahey par elaan kar diya ki ye aresas or bijepi kii harakat he, lekin wo darane or jhukne vaale nahin hai
 Now that Rahul has declared that the person throwing the shoe belongs to the BJP-RSS, then the Congress is busy exploring the history of this Hariom Mishra that if a picture of him is found with the BJP leaders, then the point of Rahul Gandhi is correct
 kisi party se koi conection nahinphilhal khabar likhane tak is shaks kaa kisi party, sanghathan yaa netaa se koi sambandh saamne nahin aayaa he, lekin uske sambandhon ko khangaalane kaa kaam philhal jari he
 Meanwhile, Sitapur police has registered a case against the young man who threw the shoe

 In this, a case has been filed on charges of defamation of the accused, assault on public servant with criminal intent
 baharhaal doctorl jaanch main ye yuvak dimagi rup se durust paaya gaya he, lekin usne aisa kyon kiya iskaa jawaab philhal uske paas bhi nahin he

 kangana ke saath sona chaahati hai kalki, Nude photo kii thi post Tridip Suhridadridranarayan
 is chhavi main aseem takat kii sambhaavna he
 To think of a poor person as God and to see God as poor in an equally important sense is a very free thought
 vah ek samaaj ko, ek vyakti ko or yahaan tak ki ek arthvyavastha ko bhi is ichha, jarurat or apeksha se mukt karti he ki ek din ham sabhi sampann ho jaaenge, bhale hi baraabar sampann na sahi
 It also — perhaps only — liberates religious gatherings, organizations, groups, and men and women who show them the path to material prosperity from their zeal
 daridranarayan kii chhavi ham sabko is vishwaas se bhi mukt karti he ki bhautik vasteen hi inasaani ahmiyat kaa vaastavik paimaana hoti hai or isliye inhen hasil karnaa hi sabase upyogi purusharth he
 The second philosophical form of Daridranarayana is that of Satyanarayana i
e
 truth is God
 mohandas karamchand gandhi ne ishwar ko daridr kaa yaa daridr ko ishwar kaa or satya ko hi ishwar kaa swaroop dekar darasal ishwar kii avadharana ko uski mul roopantarkari or mukt karne vaali kshamta lautaa di
 This possibility takes economics and economists away from them
 yah baat unke samay main bhi utani hi satya thi jitani ki hamaare samay main he
 The lack of deep thinkers around Gandhi or the economics of economics around Gandhi is particularly shocking
 lekin iske do ullekhneey apwaad rahe
 One was Joseph Cornelius Kumarappa
 unki pustak survey of maatar taluka ne hamen bhartiya kisaanon kii garibi ke bare main pehali baar kuch pramukh nishkarsh die
 The other was Richard Gregg
 ve america the, kanoon main siddhhast, patibaddh ahimsak or behad kam suvidhaon main jivan jeene main sakasham
 Greg introduced an explanation of the economics of Khadi for the first time in the Economics of Khaddar
 ye haal is baat ke baavjood the ki gandhi main donon gun the
 He was also an economic thinker and the founder of institutional structures that addressed the basic concerns of economics, such as allocation of resources, creation of livelihood, production and distribution of goods and services, the nature of ownership of the means of production and their Just distribution etc
 garibi, dhanchaagat hinsa or anyaay ke amanviya swaroop ko lekar gahari chintaa unke aarthik chintan kaa mul thi
 He worked a lot on this
 garibi ko hamaari rashtriya pariklpana ke centre main lekar aane kii unki patibaddhta mahatvapurn thi
 Gandhi had many colleagues who spent their lives fighting against poverty, raising the means of living and ensuring justice and dignified life in distribution
 iske baavjood unki dharanaon ko lekar chintan kaa abhaav saaf dikhataa he
 It is possible to argue that it is more important to do than to think, at least in terms of poverty alleviation and the violence that arises in lives full of lack of opportunities, constant poverty, despair and injustice
 lekin, aisa hona bhi koi jaruri nahin
 Kumarappa's life is an example of this
 yah gandhivadi pariklpana main anya vichaaron va kaamon ke daayaron se bhi parilakshith hota he
 Vinoba Bhave's transformative call for voluntary Bhoodan stems from his deep philosophical study of religion as a theology
 isi vajah se chintan kii is kami ko samajha janaa chahie
 Gandhi's own economic thinking has often been regarded as a constant misconception of Hind Swaraj's misinterpretation
 gopal krishna gokhale kaa maananaa tha ki unnt parchaa aparipakv or jaldbaaji main taiyaar kiya hua tha or unhone ummid kii thi ki khud gandhi bharat main ek saal bitaane ke baad use apane haathon se nasht kar denge
 Jawaharlal Nehru liked to forget it
 unhone use 'pichhadepan ke romani myth' ke taur par dekha or gandhi ke saamne is baat ko sweekaar kiya ki unhen us kitaab kii kuch dhundhlee-si hi smriti he
 Vinayak Damodar Savarkar castigated Gandhi as a hopeless conservative, forcing the imagination of clay lamps and cotton wick
 yahaan tak ki jinhen gandhi or sarvoday kii unki chintaa ko lekar sahanubhuti thi, ve bhi mashiinon, railway, doctoron va vakeelon ke bina apane desh kii kalpana ko sabhy jivan ke liye anpuyukt maanate the, bhale hi chaahe un sari chizon se—jaisi ki gandhi daleel dete the—swaraj kii talash or ek vaastavik sanjayata kii jhalak main baadha aati ho
 Those who were able to see beyond the tricky nature of Hind Swaraj came up with two ideas that could be considered a symbol of Gandhi's economic thinking, and both of which were primarily confined to the realm of thought
 
 pehali thi trustiship
 Despite all the examples of 'good behavior', this is only a thought, it has not turned into an aspiration either
 yah kchayaal hamaare liye is kadar videshi tha ki shabdon ke nae arth gande main apni shandaar kaabiliyat ke baavjood khud gandhi gujarati yaa hindi main bolte vakt bhi iske liye angreji shabd kaa hi istemaal karte the
 The second belief was the relationship between ethics and economics and always prioritize ethics
 ye donon dharanaen alag-alag hote hue bhi ek hi mul bhav se upji thim—naitik vyavhaar kaa dayera
 The plea of a trustee to develop interest in personal property has always been of moral or philosophical nature and has come under the purview of virtues
 in dharanaon kaa aage vistaar karne kii gunjaaish bhi he
 Especially in the realm of ecology it can be seen well
 ham jis ravaiye or aacharan kii vakaalat karte hai, vah prithvi, uske sansadhano or uske bhavishya ke prati trustee kii bhoomika ko apnaane vaali he
 Its resonance is heard in deep ecology
 gandhi, or trustiship va arthshaastra main naitikta kii praathamikta ke unke khyaalon ko vaise to aage badhaane vaale nae log milte rahe hai lekin bharat main rajya niti main unki upyogita keval garibi ke khilaaf kuch yojanaon ko unka naam de dene bhar kii rahi he, bhale hi aam taur par ve sarthak va gambhir hoti hon
 There are few people who believe that Gandhi's economic thinking was really far-reaching
 saal 1928 main jab aadhunik aarthik arthvyavastha ko pehla gaharaa jhatka lagane vaala tha, tab unhone ek charchaa ke dauraan kaha tha, ''khuda khayr kare ki bharat ko pashchim kii nakal main audyogikaran ko kabhi na apnaanaa pade
 The economic colonialism of a small island empire is now holding the whole world in bed
 agar tees karod kii aabaadi vaala samoochaa desh isi tarah ke aarthik shoshan ke raste par chal niklaa to vah puri duniya ko dimak kii tarah chaat jayega
 In this, Gandhi attacks the heart of the structure of the modern world economy
 audyogic arthvyavastha keval steam ingine or urja kii jaruraton ko puraa karne ke liye jeevashm eendhan ko jutaney kii jugat kaa hi utpaada nahin thi, balki usamen yah bhi jaruri tha ki asia, africa va latin america main duniya ke bade hisse main aupniveshak jariyon se utpaadan va upbhog kii pravriti ko niyantrit va niyamit kiya jaataa rahe
 Gandhi was not troubled by the late arrival of capital intensive-production in India
 ve is deree ke liye shukraguzaar hi the
 Gandhi's emphasis on prioritizing ethics over economics challenged the very foundation of a positive economy, based directly on the ludicrous notion that all citizens as consumers would maximize their net material gains within the confines of relevant boundaries
 Let's try
 gandhi ek adarsh aarthik vyavastha kii baat karte the
 It is possible that a model of 'an ideal economy' is proposed in which primary economic values such as high rates of growth, full employment, economic efficiency, stability and even stability are achieved
 gandhi ke maanak, naitik vyavhaar par unka jor, aparigrah, astey (chori na karnaa, na to prithvi se or na hi aane vaali peedhishon se), trustee kaa bhav ham sabake bheetar paidaa karne par jor- ye sab aarthik mulyon ko hasil karne ke bare man nahin hai
 In a discussion organized to commemorate the hundredth anniversary of Gandhi's birth, Raj Krishna described Gandhi's economic thinking as essentially an ideal standard that differed from normal economic values
 unhone is baat ko lekar aagaah kiya ki is tarah ke aarthik model par dhyaan dene vaale kam hi hote hai jo ''unki saamaanya aarthik arjanshiltaa ke saath dakhsandaji karte hai'', or is tarah ke model ''kahin bhi vyapak str par kaamyaab'' nahin hue hai, chaahe ve model samyavaadee hon, sahakaari hon yaa phir gandhivadi
 Those of us who are poor and deprived of opportunities should find their own normative answers
 jawaab main kai baar ham niyati dekhte hai
 But this is not necessary
 daridranarayan kii dharna sampann logon ko nahin bhaayegi
 But the idea of trusteeship is for everyone
 yah puunji ke sanchayan va sangrahan ke khilaaf nahin, balki naitik anivaaryta ke taur par punarvitarit nyaay kaa khyaal he
 The only way to save us from poverty-like violence is to adopt normative behavior: whether it is pervaded in God, in daridranarayana or in trusteeship without any reference to God

 dusron kobhakti or mukti kaa paath padhaane vaale asaram baapu ab khud is duniya ke kanoonee jhamelon main funs gaye hai
 Bapu, who is showing the path of liberation, has come under threat of his own arrest
 baapu par laga iljaam is baar kahin zyada sangeen he or desh kii sabase smart police bhi unhen is aarope se mukti dene ke katai mood main nahin he
 Asaram Bapu has been accused by a 16-year-old minor girl that Bapu raped her on her Independence Day on August 15 in her ashram in Jodhpur
 dilli ke kamala market thane main di gai ek shikaayat main 16 saal kii is ladki ne naa sirf baapu ko apana gunahagaar bataaya he, balki magistrate ke saamne 164 ke tahat die apane bayaan main bhi usne baapu par jor-jabardastee karne kii baat kahi he
 The girl got her medical done immediately after the girl was charged
 medical main yon shoshan kii baat sahi pai gai he
 After this, Delhi Police registered a case against Asaram Bapu under Section 376 of the IPC i
e
 Rape, Section 342 i
e
 unlawful hostage, 506 i
e
 attempt to kill and under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offenses Act ie POSCO
 have taken
 ye sari dharaaen gaiyr jamaanti hai
 So will Bapu be arrested now? So now the Jodhpur police will answer this because the crime has been done in Jodhpur
 lihaaja karrwai bhi ab vahiin hogi
 But it is certain that the days ahead for Bapu are troublesome because the victim girl is now going to Jodhpur from Delhi
 satsang kar karodon main khelanevaale asaram baapu par iljaam or tohamat koi nai baat nahin he lekin is baar un par jo aarope lage hai, usne ab tak duusare tamaam iljaamon ko peeche chhod diya he or ye aarope bhi koi maamuli nahin, balki ye aarope he ek naaballig ladki ke yon shoshan kaa
 The girl was sexually abused, who had gone to their gurukul for education, rituals and initiation, but if the girl believes that Asaram not only disappointed her, she even did more with her in private
 chhindwara ke gurukul main padhai kar chuki ladki ke mata-pita ne is silsile main dilli ke kamala market thane main asaram ke khilaaf jo report likhavai he, wo behad sangeen he
 Assuming this report, Asaram not only sexually abused his daughter, but even threatened to kill her if she told anyone about it or opened her mouth
 shikaayat ke mutabik chhindwara ke gurukul main padhanevaali is ladki ke gharavaalon ko ashram kii warden ne 8 agast ko phone kar bataaya tha ki unki beti kii tabiyat bighad gai he or philhal baapu ne dur se hi mantra phoonk kar unki beti ko philhal thik kar diya he lekin chunki us par bhoot-pret kaa saaya he, use puri tarah thik hone ke liye baapu ko anushthan karnaa hoga
 Hearing this, the girl's family brought her daughter home
 report ke mutabik iske baad ve anushthan ke liye baba se milanaa chaahate the or tab unhen bataaya gaya ki baba 14 agast ko jodhpur ke ashram main milenge
 Now the girl's parents took their daughter to Jodhpur for the ritual
 vahaan baapu ne unke thaharne kaa intjaam karvaa diya or 15 agast yani swatantraaa diwas ke din anushthan ke bahaane unki beti ke saath usee ashram main hi yon shoshan kiya
 When the girl protested, Baba shut her mouth and threatened to kill her
 shikaayat ke mutabik ladki dar gai thi
 After this, when the whole family returned home, on 17 August, the girl told the whole thing to her family members
 un par aasmaan tut padaa
 Meanwhile, he came to know that Bapu is camping at Ramlila Maidan in Delhi from 18 to 20 August
 is par parivaar dilli pahunchaa or unhone ramlila maidan ke paas kamala market police se jaakar puure maamle kii shikaayat kii
 After this, the police also conducted a medical examination of the girl
 haalanki asaram baapu kii pravaktaa neelam dube ke mutabik ye saare ke saare iljaam hawa-hawaii hai or jald hi jaanch se doodh kaa doodh or pani kaa pani ho jayega
 However, after this serious case, now the danger of arrest on Bapu has arisen
 haalanki ab aage maamle kii jaanch jodhpur police karegi
 Because according to the accusation of the girl, she was raped in Jodhpur
 hindu parampara main sant hona samaaj kii achchhiyon se bhi upar hona mana jaataa he lekin jab ek sant par hi baar baar vivaadon ke badal ghir kar aane lagen to sant kii shuchita par sawaal khadey hona laazmi hai
 The accusation of sexual exploitation on Asaram Bapu is in fact a new episode of a series of accusations
 sabase sansani khej maamla saamne aayaa tha july 2008 main jab asaram ke ahmedabad ashram main padhane vaale do maasoom bacchon kii laash ashram ke saath se hi bahane vaali sabarmati nadi main mili
 After the mysterious deaths of 11-year-old Dinesh Vaghela and ten-year-old Abhishek Vaghela, the family members held the ashram responsible
 yahaan tak kii police ne bhi apane halafname main ashram main chalane vaale kaale jaadu or duusari rahasyamayi karstaniyon kaa khulaasa kiya tha
 The uproar over the death of two children was not yet brought to an end that the body of four-and-a-half-year-old child Ramakrishna Yadav was found in Asaram's ashram school in Chhindwara, Madhya Pradesh
 is khabar ke milte hi hadkamp much gaya jo agle hi din bavaal main tabdeel ho gaya kyonki ashram ke bathrum main ek or bachche kii rahasyamayi haalat main maut ho gai thi
 However, later the police caught the case of a child studying in class ninth of this school, who said that he wanted to be freed from the confinement of the ashram
 kai pulisavaalon ke mutabik ye bachche kaa ye haal ashram kii naarkeey sthitiyon kii vajah se hua tha
 In the month of December 2009, Asaram Bapu had created a sensation by his former devotee Raju Chandok accusing him of trying to kill him
 vaardaat tab hui thi jab raju ek raat bike se apane ghar laut rahe the or andhere main do logon ne hatya ke iraade se un par goli chalaa di thi
 The Gujarat police had also named Asaram in the case
 itnaa hi nahin sansar ko moh maaya se mukt hone kaa bhaashan pilaane vaale asaram par zamin hadapney kaa aarope bhi jadaa gaya he
 In January 2009, a survey by the Land Department of Gujarat revealed that 65,000 square meters of land in Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar have been illegally set aside for the ashram of Asaram
 disambar 2009 main hi is avaidh kabje ko khaali karne kaa aadesh bhi suna diya gaya tha
 The Delhi unit of Asaram Ashram was accused by an elderly woman of Delhi, Sudarshan Kumari, that through fake documents, a floor of her house in Rajouri Garden has been made the property of the ashram
 ab ek baar phir asaram baapu sawaalon ke ghere main hai
 The great thing is that this time it is not his ashram, but he himself is on the target of serious allegations like sexual abuse
 yani is baar unke liye apana bachaav karnaa aasaan nahin hoga
 Sometimes Saint Asaram's hand was stained, sometimes his tongue made him stand in the dock
 baba kai baar kuch aisa bol gaye ki vivaad khadaa ho gaya
 On 7 January 2013, Asaram made such an outrageous statement that the entire nation was stunned when the entire country including Delhi was unaware of the gang rape incident in the Delhi Nirbhaya rape case
 bayaan par koharaam laga to baba media par tohamat jadne lage ki unki baat ko galat tareeke se rakhaa gaya he
 Baba's exploits are not just here
 aaropon kii puri fehrist he
 a few days ago, a devotee alleged against Asaram that Asaram kicked him when he tried to seek Baba's blessings during the discourse
 iske baad court ke aadesh par asaram ke khilaaf maamla darj hua tha
 During a lecture in Indore on 10 April 2012, Asaran lost his temper and uttered abuses to one of his servants
 use pagal sevagadar kaha or kapade utaar use shivi se baahar bhagane kaa aadesh diya
 During a meditation camp in Delhi on 9 October 2011, Babbole Baba said about Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi that Rahul Gandhi is a low-minded bablu
 27 june 2011 ko asaram ne mahatma gandhi ke bare main kaha tha ki gandhi ko desh chhodkar chale janaa chahie tha
 During the last Holi, when a large area of maharashtra was in the grip of severe drought, Holi played with devotees in Surat and wasted thousands of liters of water
 isapar asaram ne kaha ki ham kisi sarkaar yaa sarkaar ke baap se pani nahin lete
 He would definitely play Holi and he also played Holi in Maharashtra
 asaram or vivaad saath-saath chalate hai
 At times Asaram airs controversies to remain in the headlines, but this time the charge that has been leveled on him is very serious
 dekhnaa ye he ki asaram isse kaise ubarte hai
 In Haryana, two or more newspapers in favor of any candidate contesting the assembly elections will have the same news content and the same picture as 'paid news'

 First MLA Anand Singh resigned on Monday
 uske baad shaam hote hote ek or vidhayak ramesh jarakiholi ke istipha dene kii khabaren aa gayi
 After the resignation of the party mlas, Congress Legislature Party leader Siddaramaiah has called a meeting of the legislature party at his residence in Bengaluru
 sutron ke anusaar siddharmaiya is baithak main vidhayakon ke istife ke baad rajya main ban rahi sthiti par baat kar sakate hai
 On the other hand, Karnataka BJP leader and former Chief Minister of the state BS Yeddyurappa has said that after the resignation of Congress mlas, they will explore the possibility of forming a BJP government in the state
 bataa den ki yah koi pehla mauka nahin he jab karnataka main gathbandhan sarkaar ke saamne sabhi ko ekajute rakhte hue saath chalane kii chunauti ai ho
 Earlier too, there were reports of Congress mlas getting in touch with BJP
 us dauraan kaha gaya tha ki congress ke kuch vidhayak party se naaraaz hai or bijepi ke saath janaa chaahate hai
 However, all these speculations were misunderstood by the Congress party
 gauratlab he ki anand singh ne congress se apane istife ke baad kaha, 'haa, maine aaj subah istipha diya he
 "on being told that Speaker KR Ramesh Kumar has not confirmed the resignation, Singh said," Is that so? Then i will resign again
 ' adhyaksh ne koi istipha milane se inkaar kiya he
 Kumar said, "I have not received any resignation
 kisi ne istipha dene ke liye mujhase sampark nahin kiya he
 The MLA did not say why he has resigned

 atakalein lagaai ja rahi hai ki vah bhaajapa main shaamil honge
 Singh had gone into seclusion in the Congress last year when dissatisfaction was at its peak, but he later came forward and showed his loyalty to the party
 is prakaar kii atakalein bhi tej thim ki congress ke kam se kam chah or vidhayak bhi party ke khilaaf baghawat kar sakate hai
 On the other hand, former Chief Minister of Karnataka BS Yeddyurappa has said that if the government falls, we will explore all the possibilities of forming the government but there is no question of a new election

 Rape cases have increased since people from all over the country came to the streets
 hamaare desh kii rajdhani dilli, aaj vishwa main ‘rape capital’ ke naam se badnaam he

 If you want to watch a patriotic film in the midst of a patriotic and non-political 26 January atmosphere, then Manikarnika is appropriate
 is film ke saath hi shivasena ke sansthaapak bal thakare ke jivan par aadhaarit film thakare bhi relies ho rahi he

 The 17th Lok Sabha election is over
 1989 se himachal pradesh main apni pakad banaae hue bijepi is baar bhi mustaid he
 That is why the party has handed over the election strategy to its trusted leader Prem Kumar Dhumal here
 dhumal 10 april ko 75 saal ke ho rahe hai, unhen 4 dashak se zyada kaa raajnneeti kaa anubhav he
 During this time, he was CM 2 times, MLA 4 times and MP 3 times
 aise main unke himachal sansadeey chunaav main bijepi ke liye chunaav daanv-pech set karne se nishchit hi virdohi soch main honge
 Prem Kumar Dhumal was born on 10 April 1944 in the village of Sameerpur in Hamirpur district of Himachal Pradesh to Captain Mahant Ram
 inhone diavi hiskool hamirpur se metric, diavi college jalandhar se grajuation or doaba college jalandhar se 1970 main eme (english) main post grajuation kiya
 He had a keen interest in sports and politics in student life
 wo college wollyboul team ke captain bhi rahe
 After completing his education, Prem Kumar Dhumal was appointed as a spokesperson at Punjab University (jalandhar)
 phir doaba college jalandhar chale gaye
 While working here, Dhumal studied law at Guru Nanak Dev University, Punjab
 dhumal kii shaadi shila se hui, unke do bete anuraag thakur or arun thakur hai
 At the moment, Anurag is the big face of politics, he is a three-time MP from Hamirpur parliamentary seat while Arun is away from politics
 kareeb 80 ke dashak se raajnneeti se jude prem kumaar dhumal ko pehali baar 1980 main bijepi sanghathan main ahm jimmedaari mili
 He was made the secretary of the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) and then its vice president from 1982-1985
 is dauraan ne unhone bijepi sanghathan ko majboot banane ke liye ji tod mehnat kii
 Even though Dhumal did not get to learn politics in the RSS nursery, he has deep connections with many Sangh leaders today
 aaj ‘main bhi chaukeedaar’ muhim se judate hue twitor par apane naam ke aage ‘chaukeedaar’ likh chuke prem kumaar dhumal kii ginati pradhanmantri narendra modi ke karibiyon main hoti he
 The witness of this is that period of 1984, when BJP veteran Jagdev Chandra refused to contest from Hamirpur parliamentary seat, then Narendra Modi (then-bjp in-charge of Himachal) at the time, promoted Dhumal's name
 
 yah unke chunavi raajnneeti main pravesh kaa ek durlabh sanyog tha
 However, Dhumal lost this election to Congress leader Narayan Chand Prasar
 lekin unhone saal 1989 main apni haar kaa badla liya or 1991 main seat barkaraar rakhi
 Dhumal held the post of BJP General Secretary from 1985-93
 1993 main jagadev chandra kaa nidhan hua
 By this time, Prem Kumar Dhumal was counted among the top leaders of the state, and in 1993 he became the president of the BJP unit of Himachal Pradesh
 wo is pad par 1996 tak rahe
 In this era, he was once again in the Lok Sabha election-1996 battle as a BJP candidate, but this time he had to face defeat
 prem kumaar dhumal ke liye saal 1998 aitihaasik pal lekar ai, kyonki isi saal wo pehali baar himachal pradesh ke mukhyamantri bane
 He led the bjp-himachal Vikas Congress (HVC) coalition government for five years (from March 1998 to March 2003)
 prem kumaar dhumal ko rajya ke mukhyamantri ke rup main purna kaarykaal puraa karne vaale ekmaatr bijepi netaa hone kaa gaurav praapt he

 The Supreme Court on Tuesday refused to release Sahara chief Subrata Roy on interim bail or parole, but allowed him to sell his luxurious hotels in New York and London so that he could get Sebi as per the instructions given to get regular bail
 Can raise 10 thousand crores for handing over
 subrat raay takreeban paanch maheene se salaakhon ke peeche hai
 The apex court, however, assured Rai, 65, that she would allow him to go out of jail in police custody during the day so that he could negotiate with the buyers to settle his property

 The court had asked Sahara chief to pay Rs 10,000 crore to get bail
 isamen se paanch hajaar karod rupee nakad or shesh raashi bank guarantee ke rup main den
 Sahara has so far raised only Rs 3117 crore which has been deposited to the market regulator

 During the last hearing held on July 4, Rai had pleaded with the court to show mercy and asked to be allowed to come out of jail to sell his properties

 - taran adarsh (@taran_adarsh) June 12, 2019 Let us know that Salman Khan's film Bharat is a story of a man and a country
 is film main salmaan 5 alag-alag avatar main najar aa rahe hai
 Salman has played a character ranging from young 18 years old to 72 years old man
 film main salmaan ke saath katrina caff, disha paatani, tabboo, jaiki shroff or sunil grover ahm kirdaar main hai
 The film is a Hindi remake of the Korean film An Odd to My Father
 mere param mitra narbhasalal ek maheene pehle achaanak se laapata ho gaye the
 His family, friends, relatives were all upset
 police ke paas shikaayat lekar gaye lekin laapata kaa report likhane se manaa kar diya ki pehle talasho or nahin mila tab report likhavana
 Finally, yesterday suddenly Narbhaslal appeared
 unhe sahi salaamat dekhakar maine raahat kii saans lee
 i scolded and said what are you crazy about
 kahaan chale gaye the, pataa he sab kitne pareshaan hai, na to phone kiya or upar se apana phone bhi band rakhaa tha
 Narbhaslal turned on before i could say anything else
 bole, ‘pehle hamaara baat suno phir apana lacture jhaadna
 'I started looking at them
 phir wo flash back main chale gaye or apni katha bataani shuru kar di jo is prakaar he
 Said, 'O Sujit, you know that the debate was going on in Parliament that day and the Home Minister was raising the thunder of the opposition to remove Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir
 jaise hi grahamantri ne anuchhed 370 kaa thonthi (galaa) dabaa kar ragadnaa shuru kiya ham sidhe kashmir nikal gayi
 First of all, think there are two hard land and buy land
 ek baar jameen kharid liye phir is saal ke ant tak vahaan pakkaa makaan nahin to khapril kaa ghar to bana hi lenge
 If you will find a place in heaven after you die or you don't know, i thought that i can enjoy the happiness of Kashmir, which is called heaven on earth
 kuch nakadi or checkbuk lekar nikal padaa kashmir
 But father, father, there, you were caught man
 vahaan jitne gachh (ped) nahin honge utana to donali lekar jawan khadey the
 Such eyes turn red with eyes, as if we are the brothers-in-law of Osama bin Laden
 khayr kisi tarah ek hotel main jagah mila, sochaa laut jaaun lekin sara rasta aise band kiya hua he ki koi padalo chal kar air port nahin pahunch saktaa
 The money that was taken to buy the land was spent in the hotel
 mobile, internet sab band tha so sampark bhi nahin kar sakaa
 Kashmir, called the paradise of the earth, seemed no less than a hell
 itnaa paharaa ki saans bhi soch-soch kar lenaa pade
 If it remained like this for a few days, then you would run from there to the bird and stay in Darbhanga
 khayr kisi tarah ek maheene baad jab thodaa raahat mila to vahaan se nikal kar aayaa
 When he came out of the state limits, it was found that Sushma Swaraj and Arun Jaitley went to heaven
 itnaa dukhi hua is samachar se ki, khaanaa khaae bina scooter uthaa kar tum se milane niklaa
 Traffic policeman was found on the way
 phir unhone vah haal kar diya jo kashmiriyon kaa in dinon he
 In Kashmir, the army and other parts of the country have been so invaded that the living was in a mess
 trephikwaale ne 15 hajaar kaa chaalaan kar diya
 The money was not so fast and took the match and put the fire in the scooter
 phir paidal chalate-chalate tumhaare ghar pahunchaa hum kisi tarah se’
 i started again before i could say anything
 bole ki, ‘kuch paise udhaar de do’
 i said what was the need of money like this
 bole ‘bhai, paise to bank main hai lekin kis branch main jaakar paise nikaalun yah samajhe nahin aa rahaa he’
 i asked him why he said, 'brother, the bank that had an account has heard that it has been merged with another bank
 main to puraa kanphyus ho gaya hum, meraa bank kisi duusare bank main marz ho gaya he yaa phir mere bank main koi doosraa bank marz kar gaya he’
 i said what does it matter? If you can withdraw the money, then you said, 'yes brother, i am saying that when you can withdraw money from any bank, then what is the benefit of merging it'
 maine kaha ki sarkaar ghate main chal rahe bainkon ko doobane se bachaane ke liye aisa kar rahi he to bole, ‘bhai marz karne se kya nirab modi yaa vijay maalya jo paisa lekar bhaag gaya tha vah waapas milegaa kya
 You already know that Sangat has an effect
 yadi biimaar bank, swasth bank main mila die gaye to iskaa baat kii ashanka he ki swasth bank bhi biimaar pad jaae
 Did not see that to fix Kashmir, efforts started to make it like other states and the operation of NRC failed
 narbhasalal kii baat sunakar main khud hi narbhasane laga
 Immediately he went towards the dhaba to dine with him

 or ye kaich kisi or ne nahin, balki ipel-10 ke sabase mahange khilaadi ben stokes ne liya
 On the fifth ball of the 20th over of Delhi's innings, Stokes took a great catch on Shami's boundary line

 Jumping like Superman in the air, he took a surprise catch
 ben stokes ne apni shandaar fielding se sabhi kaa dil jeet liya

 jayadev unadakat kii gend par shami ne leg said par ek bahut hi karaara shot jadaa jo seemaa rekha ke baahar ja rahaa tha
 But Stokes did not let this happen through his superb fielding

 If a JDU leader gets an invitation from the RJD, he may consider joining or not joining it privately

 Delhi, considered to be the world class, is in many ways laggard compared to many cities of the country
 ye khulaasa hua he bengalore kii ek enjio kii ore se karaae gaye ek survey main
 Bangalore-based NGO Janaagraha conducted a survey in 11 cities across the country
 survey main yun to 100 se zyaada maanakon par shaharon ko ksaa gaya
 But when the numbers were added to the total, Delhi was seen standing at the bottom
 darasal dilli ne planning or dizine ke maamle main desh bhar ke shaharon main doosraa sthaan hasil kiya
 In terms of the city's capacity and resources, Delhi also surpassed all cities to achieve the first position
 lekin jivan style par asar daalane vaale 21 karkon main se 13 main use 10 main se 5 se bhi kam ank mili
 These include crime, pollution, sanitation and open environment for the people
 is survey main shaharon ko parakhane vaale bhi jaankaar maanate hai ki dilli main sudhaar kii kaaphi zarurat he
 This survey not only includes large cities by population across the country, but also compares them to the big cities of the world, New York and London
 aise main dilli jab kai myanon main surat or pune jaise shaharon se hi kahin peeche he to unase kya tulana
 If we talk about the development of big cities across the country, then the name of capital Delhi will definitely come in mind
 lekin sahi mine main kya vaaki dilli ne itani tarakkee kar lee he? kya dilli main wo saare sansaadhan maujuud hai jo aam aadmi kii jindagi ko aasaan banaate hai? shaayad aapkaa jawaab haa main ho lekin janaagrah enjio kii report par gaur karen to aankade behad chaunkaane vaale hai
 Bypassing the competition from the big cities of the world, Delhi is far behind in the race even from some small cities of India
 aap bhi najar daaliye un aankadon par jo desh kii sabase badi rajdhani ko sabase chota sabit karte hai
 The reality of World Class City Delhi is shocking
 chaahe planning kii baat ho yaa phir sansadhano kii
 Things have become much worse
 enjio janaagrah ke survey ne chamak-damak vaali dilli kii asli tasviir dikhalaai he
 This survey was done not only in Delhi, but in 11 major cities of the country including London, New York
 survey main jo nattejey saamne aae usamen dilli sabase peeche khadi najar ai
 Urban Planning and Delhi
 
 
 shahari yojana main dilli ke khate main sirf 3
 Only 9 numbers have come
 dilli ke mukaable kolkata ne 4
 Gained 2 numbers
 shahari kshamta, sansaadhan or dillidesh kii rajdhani ke lihaaj se shahari kshamta or sansaadhan ko lekar bhi badhachadhakar daawey kiye jate hai
 But the survey shows that the city of Delhi is not much ahead of the small towns here too
 shahari kshamta main rajdhani chote shaharon ke baraabar sansaadhan main dilli ko mili 2
 Number 9
 raajnneetik pratinidhitiv or dillivaidhanik or raajnneetik pratinidhitiv ke maamle main dilli kii haalat behad khasta najar ai
 Small cities here outscored Delhi in this matter
 survey ke mutabik raajnneetik pratinidhitiv ke lihaaj se dilli 2
 Looked at 2K notch
 jabaki ahmedabad, chennai, hyderabad, jaipur, kanpur, kolkata, mumbai, pune or surat ne dilli se baaji maar lee
 Reliability and Delhi According to the survey, Delhi has lost its credibility in terms of transparency and reliability
 paardarshita or vishwasaneeyata main dilli ne hasil kiye 1
 Number 2
 ahmedabad, bangalore, chennai, hyderabad, kanpur, kolkata, mumbai, pune, surat dilli se zyada bharosemand rahe
 Eleven and two foreign cities have been included in the survey, including Delhi
 lagbhag har paaydaan par dilli chote shaharon ke mukaablen phiseddi sabit hui
 In such a situation, comparing Delhi with foreign cities is far-fetched

 Mukhtar Ansari contested this election from jail
 ve puure chunaav main nahin aa sake lihaaja prachaar kii kaman unke chote bete umr ansaari ne sanbhali
 At first Omar and his supporters hoped that Mukhtar would get parole, but that did not happen
 mukhtaar ke prachaar kii kaman sanbhaalane waalon kaa pehle se hi daawa tha ki vipakshi partiyaan chaahe jitani koshish kar le or unhen kshetra main na aane de par janata unhen baari voton se jeet dilaaegi or aisa hi hua

 mukhtaar ansaari ne yah chunaav jail se ladaa tha
 He could not come for the entire election, so his younger son Umar Ansari took over the campaign
 pehle umr or unke samarthakon ko ummid thi ki mukhtaar ko perol mil jaaegi, par aisa nahin hua
 Those who commanded Mukhtar's campaign had already claimed that the public would win them by a huge number of votes as much as the opposition parties try and do not let them come to the area and this happened

 The year 2012 ends not with a bang or a whisper, but with a scream
 2010 ke baad se ghotaale bharat ko kai tareeke se chot pahunchaate rahe hai
 The country suffered embarrassment due to the Commonwealth Games rigging in 2010 and then the 2G scam
 in donon prakarnon ke kaaran 2011 main anna hajaare ko jabardast samarthan or sweekaaryata mili
 After that on this support, Arvind Kejriwal's dug-out mud-throwing team threw a lot of mud at the political class
 nitin gadakari se lekar salmaan khurshid tak sabhi ko nishaanaa banaaya gaya, yahaan tak unhen bhi nahin choda gaya jo un logon ke kareeb the
 After two years of political mistakes, it was expected that the third year would fix things
 lekin ham aise khushkismat kahaan! 2012 shor-sharabe ke saath shuru hua or saal bhar usee gati par bana rahaa, yahaan tak ki balaatkaar virdohi pradarshan ne us swar ko or bhi ooncha kar diya
 Incidents such as protests against Salman Khurshid in Farrukhabad after the coal scam, protests against the nuclear plant in Kudankulam, assassinations in Assam, busting of Robert Vadra spoiled the political mood of the country
 kisi ne bhi isaki ummid nahin kii thi
 When a 23-year-old girl from Delhi was raped and dumped under the police's nose on the cold night of December, something very flammable happened in the jawans of the country
 ye yuva varg bina kisi rahanuma ke to the lekin dishaheen nahin the
 They gathered at India Gate and their anger spread to other parts of the country
 balaatkaar kii maarmik ghatana ne logon ke gusse ko bhadkaa diya jo pehle se hi ubalane ke kagaar par tha
 Once again, the political class took it with disdain, which has now become the identity of this class
 koi bhi mantri pradarshan sthal par nahin aayaa yahaan tak ki sattadhari pratishthan se koi bhi mahatvapurn vyakti india get kii ghaas or daamer par nahin chalaa
 Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde thought that such a step would set a bad precedent
 ant main unhone apane is na bayaan kiye jane vaale vaktavy ke saath apni daleel pesh kii ''kal ko agar chhattisgarh yaa gatchiroli main 100 adivasee maare ja sakate hai to kya sarkaar vahaan par bhi ho sakati he
 "this forgotten insensitivity should be noted in history
 yah to france kii rani mairi antonet kii bhul ko duusare paaydaan par bhejne ke liye kaaphi he jisamen unhone kaha tha ki agar logon ke paas khaane ke liye roti nahin he to ve kek kyon nahin khate
 Shinde's defense was adopted by the police chief and said that it would be a bad thing if peaceful protesters were injured in police action and they called him "collateral damage" (indirect damage)
 kya vah ek police pramukh ke taur par bayaan de rahe the yaa phir kisi aakraamak fouj ke pramukh ke taur par?scindia kaa vaktavy us virus kaa dyotak he jisane rajnatik varg ko apni chapet main le rakhaa he
 Others of this class will not spill or sneak on our faces like Shinde, but the disease is very deep in them
 yakeenan vahaan sarkaar ko hona chahie jahaan par logon ko maaraa ja rahaa he or unka balaatkaar kiya ja rahaa he
 This is what US President Barack Obama did when 27 people were killed by a crazy person in a small town of Connecticut
 bharat ko dekhen, yahaan chijen kitni alag hai
 While the young protesters were screaming and trying to convey their voice, the elderly leaders were at the same time excited to open their mouths
 hamaare pradhanmantri ne media ke saamne ek likhit bayaan ko bolne ke liye paanch din tak rajnatik mizaaj ko jaanchane-parakhane kii koshish kii
 Even then, he asked the television if he was so 'right!' Somewhere inside, he must have felt that his old raga has touched the hearts of the people or not, but it does not matter to them at all
 yah sab ek dastur ke mutabik kaha gaya or usee tarah logon ne ise thukraa bhi diya
 Even before, there have been terrible incidents of rape from Kashmir to Kokrajhar
 police ke 2011 ke aankadon ke mutabik rajdhani main har 18 ghante main balaatkaar kii koi na koi ghatana hoti he

 Already, more than one lakh rape cases are pending in the courts and their number is increasing
 jab sawaal mahila ke sammaan kaa ho to iskaa asar party line or saamaajik vibhaajan se upar uthakar hoga
 The reason is not that every leader also has a sister, daughter and wife
 baat yah he ki har party ne sansad yaa sadan main balaatkaar ke aaropee ko pahunchaa rakhaa he
 After all, what do our leaders need to declare that they have cut their security to a great extent? With this, thousands of police forces will be freed immediately so that they will be able to guard the streets
 aakhir hamaare saansad police sudhaar ayog kii siforeeshon ko kyon lagu nahin kar sakate? ve ek kadam aage badhkar yah elaan bhi kar sakate hai ki jin par balaatkaar kaa aarope he ab unhen unki party kii ore se tikat nahin milegi
 Go ahead, surprise us and make our new year something special
 yah sach he ki netaaon ke khilaaf kuch iljaamat adaalaton main nahin tik sakate or kisi ko adaalat main mujrim qaraar dene se pehle mujrim samajhnaa bhi sahi nahin he
 It is also true that sometimes mischievous and mean elements make false accusations
 phir bhi log chaahate hai ki aise aarope sir jhukaakar chalem
 However, a representative democracy should see the justification of something as an observance of law

 2012 samet aisa hi kuch kai varshon se ho rahaa he
 There is no doubt that rape happens everywhere, even in the best and most controlled situations
 lekin us vakt unka prabhaav vyaktigat jurm se bad jaataa he jab avam kii shikaayatein is kadar zyada hon to phir bade kadam uthaane kii jarurat aan padati he
 Who is not disturbed by the movement of a VIP? Who hasn't seen policemen openly taking bribes? Who does not know that following the law is more difficult than breaking the law? Who has not read that big scams occur under the umbrella of politicians? And who does not feel helpless in the anger that arises over the right things? So is the anger at India Gate so surprising that there is only scream, no demand? One can say that 2012 was not just remembered as an anti-corruption campaign or this December as anti-rape protests should go

 All this is happening so quickly that they are losing their importance
 jald hi ham inke itane aadi ho jaaenge ki na to bhrashtachar or na hi kisi saamaajik hinsa par hamaare andar kisi tarah kaa josh hiloren maaregaa
 Corruption has already turned into a dull subject and that is why Arvind Kejriwal is not getting the kind of support he hopes for

 If good things have to happen now, they have to be real and eye-catching
 kya hamaare netaa jald hi hamen santusht karenge

 Then it is more challenging for people with special needs
 haal ke varshon tak otism se peedit logon ke liye to rojgaar ke maukey hote hi nahin the
 But awareness has increased for some years, then people suffering from autism are also being hired
 uchit prashikshan, madad or maukon kii badaulat aaj ve log bhi apane kaam main acha kar rahe hai
 About this, author Surabhi Verma told the best career option: Every person suffering from autism has different problems and behavior
 isi vajah se ise 'spectrum disorder' kaha jaataa he
 Therefore, the same training will not solve the problem
 aisa kaam chunanaa hoga jisase otism se peedit vyakti kii takat kaa sahi istemaal ho sake
 The short term working memory of such people is very weak, but the long term memory is much better than the normal man
 otism ke shikaar vyaktiyon ko do ketegory main baanta ja saktaa he, jiske mutabik unke liye kariyar ke vikalp va rojgaar ke avasar chune ja sakate hai
 In the first category, people who have special ability to learn and think by looking can be placed
 kuch logon main yah vijual skill nahin hoti he, par ve ganit, sangeet aadi se judi baaten yaad rakhane main majboot hote hai
 The list below can be seen as an advice for career options for children with special needs
 1
 Graphic Designer / Cartoonist: Many people with autism have good imagination and ability to think differently
 agar unhen sahi vakt par uchit maargdarshan mil jaae to ve profeshan main acha kar sakate hai
 2
 photography:kai logon kii khaasiyat hoti he ki ve ek kaam par lambey vakt tak dhyaan laga sakate hai
 Photography is a good option for such people with special needs
 IIT moshan ne ye baaten hamen bataai he
 3
 anemation / webpej digining:apni kalpanashiltaa ke dam par ve behtareen anemation taiyaar kar sakate hai, kaagaj par bhi or computer par bhi
 Now some options for those who are not good visual thinkers, but can remember things related to mathematics, music, etc
 4
 Computer Programming: It is a multidisciplinary field with many applications
 isamen nae software viksit karne, network system, industrial automation jaise kai kshetra shaamil hai
 There is always a demand for good programmers
 5
 Stannistician / Market Research / Accounting: There are many works related to this for those with good mathematical ability
 sesearch, industrial kwasality control, accounting, sarkaar ke janaganana bunro aadi main unke liye vikalpam rahete hai
 6
 physicystay / mathematician / scientific research:inanaukariyonmen kaaphi acchheek analitical va data management skill kii jarurat hoti he
 This field is good for autismat people who are very good at mathematics

 AUSSIE OF THE DAY: Why this Darwin Cabbie's been recognized as "australian of the day" Posted by Nine News Darwin on sunday, 30 August 2015AUSSIE OF THE DAY: Why this Darwin Cabbie's been recognised as "australian of the day" In the eighth season of the Indian Premier League (IPL-8), the BCCI has taken a step to save the players from fixing, which will surprise you
 bisisiai ne spot phixing par lagaam lagane ke liye khilaadiyon ko mahila mitra muhaiyaa karaane kaa man bana liya he
 The reasoning behind this has been that through bookies women fans only wrap players in the net of fixing
 is mayajaal se bachane ke liye hi bisisiai ne ye kadam uthaane kaa man banaaya he
 In the eighth season of the Indian Premier League (IPL-8), the BCCI has found a way to avoid the genie of fixing
 bisisiai kii anti karpshan unit ne ipel tiimon ke tamaam khilaadiyon ke saath meeting kii or unhen samajhaayaa ki sattebaaj kis tarah se unhen phixing ke jaal main fansaate hai
 In IPL-8, it was reported that Rajasthan Royals players were approached for fixing
 ek gharelu khilaadiyon ne phixing ke liye sampark kiya tha haalanki bisisiai ne us khilaadi ke naam kaa khulaasa karne se manaa kar diya
 a franchise official was asked by our associate newspaper Today how this time the players, especially the young players, will be saved from the shadow of fixing? So his reply was, 'players have been told how they are implicated in' Honeytrap '
 unhen yakeen dilaayaa jaataa he ki wo bahut smart hai or phir unhen is mayajaal main fansaaya jaataa he
 This can happen to any of us
 is tarah se fain kii tarah khilaadiyon se judane ke baad wo khilaadiyon se personal ho jaati hai
 'he told,' It happens very fast and their relationship with the players gets strengthened very quickly
 wo khilaadiyon ke saath dinar par jaati hai or is tarah wo or kareeb aa jaati hai
 Their intimate moments MMS are created and then the players are then blackmailed through it

 mehmaan team ko tej gendbaajon kii sateek gendbaaji ke alaava of spinner moin ali kii balkhaati gendon ke saamne bhi pareshaani hui

 team india kii pune test main hui haar ko inhen shabdon main vyakt kiya ja saktaa he
 This word can be touched by cricket experts
 yah bhi kaha ja saktaa he ki ek test haarate hi media, team india ke prati bahut zyada aalochanatmak ho gaya he, lekin team india kii haar ko vyakt karne ke liye shaayad yahi mufeed shabd hai
 The match was decided in three days
 team india ke lihaaj se baat karen to donon pariyon main kul milakar uske ballebaaj 75 over bhi nahin khel paae
 In the first innings, the famous batsmen of Team India scored 40
 1 overs main leg spinner steve okiphi ke aage hathiyaar daal die vahiin duusari pari main to itane bhi over nahin khel paae
 Indian team only 33 in the second innings
 5 over tak hi wicket par tik pai or 31 ran banane vaale cheteshwar pujaara top scorer rahe
 The comments siries shuru hone ke pehle isamen team india kii jeet ke antar ko lekar badi-badi baaten kii ja rahi thim
 If a former cricketer was referring to a 4–0 win in favor of Team India, someone was assuming the difference 3–1
 baharhaal, yah nishchit hai ki australia kii ore darj kii gai is 'ankhen khol dene vaali jeet' ke baad ye awaajen uthni band ho jaaengi
 The Indian batsmen were caught in the trap that Team India had woven to trap kangaroos by creating a spin-assisted track in Pune
 pehle din se hi koi gend jump kar rahi thi to koi nichi rah rahi thi
 In such a situation, it seemed that the match would be over before five days
 lekin yah ummid kisi ne nahin kii thi ki match teen din main hi nipat jayega or haarane vaali team, viraat kohli kii team india hogi
 The way Australia's captain Steve Smith has devised his strategy and used inexperienced players, he is less than appreciated
 dabaav ab shift hokar team india par aa gaya he
 What was shocking for India in this match was that captain Virat Kohli did not go in both innings
 pehali pari main ve shunya or duusari main 13 ran par out hue
 For the long time that Virat was leading the challenge of Indian batting, he had to take this round for him, not in this match or in the next match
 darasal hona yah tha ki viraat kii is naakaami ke bich koi anya ballebaaj pari ko sanvaarane or sammanjanak score tak pahunchane kii jimmedaari nibhaataa
 Vijay, Rahul, Pujara or Ajinkya Rahane could do this
 durbhaagya se aisa nahin hua
 The Australian team broke Team India's order of being unbeatable in 19 matches and forced them to lose such a defeat that will continue to tease for a long time
 
 
 
 Before the start of the series, big things were being talked about the difference of victory of Team India
 koi purv cricketer team india ke paksh main 4-0 kii jeet bataa rahaa tha to koi yah antar 3-1 maan rahaa tha
 However, it is certain that after this 'eye-opening victory' recorded for Australia, these voices will cease to arise
 team india ne pune main spin kaa madadgaar trek banaakar kangaaroon ko fansane ke liye jo jaal buna tha, usamen bhartiya ballebaaj hi funs gaye
 From the first day, if someone was jumping the ball, then someone was staying low
 aise main yah to lag rahaa tha ki match paanch din se pehle khatm ho jayega
 But nobody expected that the match would be settled in three days and the losing team would be Virat Kohli's Team India
 australia ke captain steve smith ne jis andaaj main apni ranneeti taiyaar kii or anubhavheen khilaadiyon kaa istemaal kiya, uski jitani tarif kii jaaekam he
 The pressure has shifted to Team India
 bharat ke lihaaj se is match main dhakka pahunchane vaali baat yah rahi ki captain viraat kohli donon pariyon main nahin chale
 He was out for nothing in the first innings and 13 in the second
 viraat jitne lambey samay se bhartiya ballebaaji kii chunauti kii aguwai kar rahe the, use lihaaj se unke liye yah daur is match main nahin to agle kinhi match main aana tha
 Actually, in the midst of this failure of Virat, no other batsman would be responsible for grooming the innings and reaching a respectable score
 yah kaam vijay, rahul, pujaara athwa ajinkya rahane main se koi kar saktaa tha
 Unfortunately this did not happen
 australian team ne team india ke 19 match main aparaajey rahane ke kram ko todaa or use aisi haar par majaboor kar diya jo lambey samay tak tis detii rahegi

 Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) is boycotting the Students and Semester Examination for the fee hike
 vahiin JNU prashasan ne exam lene kaa anokhaa tarika nikaala he
 The university administration is now preparing to conduct the examination through whatsapp and email
 ye he wo patrais bare main somvaar ko sabhi centre ke chair persens ko patr bheja gaya he
 Mahapatra of Ashwini, dean of the School of International Studies (SIS), said the decision was taken by the vice-chancellor and other officials after a meeting of deans of schools and presidents of special centers due to the extraordinary situation on campus
 lekin sabhi skulon main ye kadam uthaaya ja rahaa he yaa nahin isaki pushti nahin kii ja sakati he
 He wrote in the letter that in the meeting held on December 16 at 9:30 am, it has been unanimously decided that in the academic interest of JNU students, an optional examination should be conducted in the last semester examination for mphil / phd and MA programs
 patr main kaha gaya he ki paathyakram shikshakon dwaara emphil or eme kaarykram ke liye paathyakram ke liye panjikrut chaatro ko prashn patr bheje jaaenge
 The president of the center can prepare the examination schedule as per the requirement of the center
 chaatro se anurodh he ki ve moolyankan ke liye sambandhit paathyakram shikshakon ko uttar script jamaa karen
 He said that the last date to submit the screenplay for the exam is December 21
 aise denge parikshaptr main kaha gaya he ki chaatr uttar pustikaon ko email yaa whatsap ke madhyam se yaa vyaktigat rup se paathyakram ke shikshakon ko vyaktigat rup se likh sakate hai
 Those who fail to return the examination script within the deadline may be given an additional day on 21 December
 is prakriya ko paardarshee tareeke se kaise yojit kiya ja saktaa he, ye kaise sunishchit hoga ki chaatro ne khud se pariksha likhi yaa nakal kii, ye kaise satyapit kiya ja saktaa he
 Replying to Indian Express, Prof Mahapatra said that there is no other way out in the given circumstances
 main keval chaatro ke bhavishya ko lekar chintit hum
 jnu's Teachers and Students Association (JNUTA) and (JNUSU) have called this method of taking the exam completely absurd
 JNUTA ne kaha ki ye puri tarah se avishwasaneey acadmic eksrasij karke baar baar puri vyavastha kaa majaak banaaya ja rahaa he
 The way the JNU administration has adopted this process, it makes sense how many inept people are headed in higher education
 kehane kii jarurat nahin he ki note main prastaavit kuch bhi tay prakriya ke madhyam se tay nahin kiya gaya he
 JNUSU said that these are meant to divide students and pitting one against the other which will not succeed as usual, but the administrator or ABVP may try

 Congress President Rahul Gandhi's visit to Mandsaur is being seen as an election bugle by the party
 aise main chunavi gathjod or ranneetiyon ko lekar bhi alag-alag atakalein lagaai jane lagi hai, jinamein sabase ahm mudda congress ke mukhyamantri chehre kaa he
 Madhya Pradesh Congress President and MP Kamal Nath answered this question in an interview to the English newspaper Indian Express
 jab unase shivaraj singh ke saamne party phase ke bare main poocha gaya to unhone ghumaakar iskaa jawaab diya
 Kamal Nath said that troubled farmers, unemployed youth, insecure women and unhappy businessmen will be our electoral face
 haalanki, unhone apane jawaab main ye bhi kah diya ki agar chunaav se pehle mukhyamantri kaa cheharaa saamne laane kii jarurat padati he, to is par party adhyaksh rahul gandhi faisla lenge
 He also denied the claims of not getting everything right among former chief ministers Digvijay Singh, Jyotiraditya Scindia and others

 He told that we will talk to all such parties
 unhone ye bhi kaha ki bahujan samaaj party or duusare dalon se vah sampark main hai, lekin abhi tak kuch tay nahin ho paaya he
 However, the BSP could prove to be quite decisive for the Congress
 bispi he ahmamadhya pradesh ke 2013 vidhansabha chunaav ke aankadon ko dekha jaae to kul 230 siton main se bijepi ko 165 siten mili thim or uskaa vot pratishat 44

 basapa ko haalanki mahaj 4 siton par jeet mili thi, lekin uskaa vot pratishat 6

 itnaa hi nahin bispi 11 siton par duusare number par rahi thi

 The Congress is the main opposition party here and has tasted power several times

 'gauratlab he ki 80 ke dashak main uttar pradesh chhod dilli kii raajnneeti kaa hissaa banane valishila dikshitne kabhi peeche mudakar nahin dekha
 Under his leadership, the Congress has been in power in Delhi for the last 15 years
 shila dikshitne kaha, 'jab main dilli ai to yah ek badi chunauti thi or main apni bhoomika nibhaai
 Now i am ready for new challenges again
 'dilli kii mukhyamantri se jab poocha gaya ki kya dilli vidhansabha chunaavon main lagaataar chauthi baar congress party ke chunaav prachaar kaa netritv karengi to unhone is baat ke saaf sanket die ki ve rashtriya raajnneeti kaa hissaa ban sakati hai
 He said, 'yes, if i am the Chief Minister of Delhi
 agar bhoomika main badlaav hota he to nahin
 Anything can happen
 'yah puche jane par ki kya agar wo centre main jaati hai to sandip dikshit ko kaman mil sakati he?shilane kaha ki wo empi hai, emele nahin
 The party has to decide
 dilli kii mukhyamantrishila dikshithor shahari vikaas mantri kamalnath ke bich masterplan par vaicharik matbhed hai ye khud mukhyamantri maanati he
 In a special meeting, Shila Dixit said that high buildings cannot be built everywhere in Delhi
 shila dikshitkaa kahana he ki dilli main faisla lene vaali kai agenciyon kii vajah se talmail kii samasya hoti he
 Despite this, its infrastructure has improved and still has to do better
 bhartiya janata party desh main party vid a diference he
 Generally political parties are bound by the constitution and as their constitution says, the party implements it
 vahiin desh main jab koi loktantric party chunaav jitkar satta main aati he to ukt party kii sarkaar desh ke samvidhan ko amal karti he
 However, in at least one case, neither the party nor the party's central government is ready to follow the rules
 kendra sarkaar main vitt mantri par kendriya rigerv bank ke saath saamanjasy banane kii jimmedaari he
 According to the rules, the Central Reserve Bank is an autonomous body and has been given this autonomy to monitor the treasury of the country
 is nigaraanee kaa daaromadar kendriya rigerv bank ke governor par rahati he
 During the three-and-a-half-year tenure of the current government, two central bank governors fell prey to conflict with the central government during their three-year tenure
 jahaan puri duniya main khyaati paane ke baavjood kendra sarkaar ne purv governor raghuram rajan ke kaarykaal ko badhaane main ruchi nahin dikhaai
 At the same time, during the tenure of the current central government, the second governor Urjit Patel left without completing his three-year term
 donon governor or jetali ke netritv vaala vitt mantralay niyam ke mutabik samanvay nahin baitha sakaa
 The disputes between the rbi-modi government that were decided by Urjit Patel's farewell
 The same issue is clearly visible within this party of the country
 party kaa samvidhan prishth 13 par kahata he ki party adhyaksh rashtriya kaaryakarini ke 120 sadasyon main se adhik se adhik 13 upaadhyaksh, 9 mahaamantri, ek mahaamantri(sanghathan), adhik se adhik 15 mantri tathaa ek koshadhyaksh ko manonith karegaa
 These office bearers will have different responsibility for the functioning of the party
 samvidhan main kiye gaye is praavdhaan ke vipareet is party main beete 30 maheenon se koshadhyaksh kaa pad khaali padaa he
 But party president Amit Shah is unable to nominate any member of the National Executive to this post
 darasal bhartiya janata party ke koshadhyaksh kaa pad 16 janvari 2016 ko tab rikt ho gaya jab tatkaaleen koshadhyaksh piyush goyal ko kendriya cabinet main jagah de di gai
 Goyal was given the Ministry of Mining with independent charge
 iske baad sitambar 2017 main rail mantralay se suresh prabhu kii chuttee ke baad goyal ko railway kaa prabhaar diya gaya
 After this, once again, the finance ministry was also given the charge due to the poor health of Finance Minister Arun Jaitley
 RBI governor shaktikant das ke saamne 5 chunautiyaanvahin piyush goyal ke kendriya cabinet main aane or prabharon main badlaav ke bich party main ek vyakti ek pad kii niti ke chalate party bina koshadhyaksh ke rahi
 The job of a treasurer in the party is to handle the funds of the party
 is kaam main party ke daftaron kaa kharch, chunaav prachaar kaa kharch, adhyaksh env anya padaadhikariyon ke party ke kaam se yatra kaa kharch jaise mahatvapurn kaam shaamil hai
 Obviously, the question arises that when the party has no treasurer since July 2016, then who is doing this work during the last 30 months
 khasbaat he ki chunaavon ke kharch kaa byora chunaav ayog ko dene kaa kaam bhi party ke koshadhyaksh kii jimmedaari he
 Therefore, how is the responsibility of this post lying vacant after Piyush Goyal being played without the treasurer
 kya party adhyaksh ne is kaam ke liye rashtriya kaaryakarini ke kisi sadsy ko is kaam main lagaaya he? yadi aisa he to kyon is sadsy ko koshadhyaksh manonith nahin kiya gaya he?party main ucch stareey sutron kii maane to sheersh netritv main party ke nae koshadhyaksh ko lekar matbhed kii sthiti he
 In a situation where the party president who wants to be nominated for this responsibility is not approved by the member national executive
 vahiin rashtriya kaaryakarini ke prabhavi sadasyon dwaara sujhaaye gaye sadsy par party adhyaksh taiyaar nahin he
 Due to this differences, the party has been working without treasurer for the past 30 months
 or sawaal yahi he ki aakhir kaise yah party bina koshadhyaksh ke kaam kar rahi he? Violence in the valley is not taking its name
 ab kendriya grih mantralay ne apni ranneeti ghati ko lekar badali he
 Security forces have now been instructed to speed up operations
 vaise buudhvaar ko baraamula main sena ke kaafile par hamalaa hua
 The Union Home Ministry says that this year, attacks on security forces have increased in the valley and infiltration from across the border
 sena beshak is baat se inkaar kar rahi ho lekin is saal qareeb 90 aatankwaadi seemaa se is paar aa chuke hai
 They have set up bases in different areas of the valley and are carrying out attacks one by one
 enditivi ko mili jaankaree ke mutabiq nauhatta or pampor main hue hamalon kii jaanch main ye baat saamne ai he ki hamalavar haal ke ghuspaithiye the
 5 terrorists were also killed in Uri
 yani pakistan kii ore se zyaada se zyaada ghuspaithiye bharat main dhakelne kii koshish jari he
 The comments piemo main rajyamantri jitendra singh ne kaha, "ye hinsa pakistan kii ore se bharat main dhakeli ja rahi he sarkaar chaahati he ki ye hinsa kaa daur khatm ho, iske liye stretage ke tahat kaam ho rahaa he
 "on the other hand, the central government has instructed the state government to face the terrorists firmly
 nae dishanirdeshon ke tahat amarnath yatra ke khatm hone ke baad suraksha balon se kaha gaya he ki wo ab aatankwaad virdohi abhiyaan tej karen
 The security forces in the valley were protective because of the visit
 grih mantralay ke mutabik beete dinon police bal bhi kaanoon vyavastha main laga hua tha
 Now they too have been asked to revive anti-terrorism operations under the new policy
 kendriya grih mantralay kaa kahana he kii is saal ghati main suraksha balon par hamale bhi bade hai or seemaa paar se ghuspaith bhi
 The army may be denying this, but this year, almost 90 terrorists have crossed the border
 unhone ghati ke alag-alag ilaaqon main adda bana liya he or ek-ek kar hamale kar rahe hai
 According to information received by NDTV, investigations into the attacks in Nauhatta and Pampore have revealed that the attackers were recent intruders
 uri main bhi 5 aatankwaadi maare gaye
 That is, efforts are on to push more and more intruders into India from Pakistan
 tippaniyan Minister of State in the PMO, Jitendra Singh said, "this violence is being pushed into India by Pakistan
 The government wants that the violence is going to end, for this work is being done under the strategy

 Under the new guidelines, after the completion of the Amarnath Yatra, security forces have been asked to intensify their counter-terrorism operations
 yatra ke chalate ghati main suraksha bal surakshatmak the
 According to the Home Ministry, the police force was also engaged in the law system in the past
 ab unhen bhi nai niti ke tahat aatankwaad virdohi abhiyaan ko zindaa karne ko kaha gaya he

 Actress Swaroop Sampat says that she is afraid to work in films with her husband actor Paresh Rawal
 swaroop ne kaha, 'ham theatre main saath kaam karte hai, lekin jahaan tak filmon kaa sawaal he main unke saath kaam karne se darati hum
 Paresh is very serious about his work and on the other hand i am very carefree
 ' unhone kaha, 'iske alaava hamen saath kaam karne ke liye koi mjedaar kahani bhi chahie or yah bhoomika chunauteepurn honi chahie
 'swaroop' s upcoming film
 balki ke nirdesan main ban rahi'kii and kaa'he
 I'm glad i got a chance to work with him
 unhone kaha, 'balki ke saath kaam karnaa mjedaar he
 I'm glad i got a chance to work with him
 mujhe nahin pataa tha kipereshmera kaam dekhakar kya kahenge, lekin jab unhone film kaa promo dekhne ke baad kaha ki tumne kaaphi acha kaam kiya he or yah ek badi raahat thi
 'ki and Ka' features actors Arjun Kapoor and Kareena Kapoor Khan in lead roles
 film main arjuna isamen ek house hasband ke kirdaar main najar aaenge
 The film will be released on 1 April
 loksabhaa chunaav 2019 main narendra modi ke vijayrath ko uttar pradesh main rokane ke liye basapa adhyaksh mayawati or sapa pramukh akhilesh yadav ne gathbandhan kaa elaan kar diya he
 Congress is excluded from this alliance
 congress ko saath na lene kii vajah mayawati ne bataai
 He said that both Congress and BJP have similar policies
 iske alaava congress ke saath gathbandhan karne kaa anubhav sapa or basapa ke liye behatar nahin rahe hai, isi maddenjar unhen shaamil nahin kiya gaya he
 Mayawati, however, said that the alliance against the Congress candidate in Rae Bareli and Amethi will not field any candidate
 mayawati ne kaha ki sapa-basapa donon ne purv main congress se gathbandhan kar chunaav lard chuki hai, lekin iskaa anubhav sabhi nahin tha
 The BSP contested the assembly elections in 1996 in alliance with the Congress in Uttar Pradesh, in which our vote was transferred to the Congress but the Congress did not get our vote
 isi tarah se 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav main akhilesh yadav ne congress ke saath milakar chunaav ladaa, lekin uskaa bhi phayda sapa ko nahin mil sakaa tha
 He said that under a well thought-out strategy, Congress vote gets transferred to BJP
 isi ke chalate congress ko gathbandhan main shaamil nahin kiya he
 Whereas SP-BSP has seen alliance before
 upachunaav main donon partiyon ke kaaryakarta ek duusare ko puri eemaandaaree se vot karte hai
 They have no regrets
 congress ko khari-kharimayawati ne kaha ki aazaadee ke baad lambey samay tak desh or uttar pradesh main sahit anya rajyon main congress ne raaj kiya he
 Under the Congress rule, the weaker sections, farmers, traders, Dalits and obcs have been troubled
 inke shasankaal main berogari or bhrashtachar badha he
 Due to this, political parties like BSP and SP were formed so that the rule of the Congress is being liberated
 unhone kaha ki bijepi and company kaa najariya or shashan kaa tarika ek hi jaisaa rahaa he
 There have been tremendous scandals by the governments of both Congress and BJP in the purchase of defense deal
 congress raaj main boforce ghotaalaa hua, jiske chalate unki sarkaar chali gai thi
 Similarly, BJP will have to lose the government in Rafale case
 congress or bijepi par nishaanaa sadhate hue mayawati ne kaha ki congress ne ghoshit rup se apatkaal laga rakhaa tha or bijepi ne aghoshit rup se laga rakhaa he
 See what kind of condition in Assam
 sapa-basapa ne gathbandhan karke chunaav ladane par 1977 jaisaa nuksaan bijepi ko uthaanaa padegaa

 # happysoulsareprettiest # familiasagrada # dublifea post shared by Sussanne Khan (@suzkr) on Dec 28, 2016 at 7:44 am PST dilli main vyapaariyon kii lakh koshish ke baavjood ceiling nahin ruk rahi he
 From Sadar Bazaar to the most posh markets of Delhi, such as Khan Market and Defense Colony Market, the process of sealing of shops is going on
 lajpat nagar kaa sabase bada ladies vier kaa bazaar, amar colony market main 700 dukaanon main se kareeb 450 dukaanon ke sil hone ke baad se vyapaariyon main baari rosh he
 Till now, small-scale agitators and protesters have decided to visit Ram Leela Maidan on a large scale
 isi silsile main dilli ke sabhi vyapaaree sanghathan dilli ke constitution club main badi sankhya main jute or apni ekta kaa parichay diya
 In this Maha Panchayat of traders, preparations were made to organize a maha agitation against sealing on March 28 at Ram Leela Maidan in Delhi
 fund se lekar vyapaariyon kii sankhya par vichaar-virmash kiya gaya or sabhi tryder association se anurodh kiya gaya ki 28 march ko dilli ke sabhi bazaar band hon, sabhi zyada se zyada sankhya main dilli ke ram lila maidan pahunchen or vyapaariyon kii takat kaa pradarshan karen
 Addressing the businessmen, Association President Pravin Khandelwal said, 'now the time has come that traders will have to demonstrate their unity and their strength
 ye jaruri he ki 28 march ko hamen itani baari sankhya main nikalnaa hoga ki dilli kii sadake ruk jaani chahie, jisase ab tak soi hui rajya or centre kii sarkarein hamaari takalifon ko samajhe
 'similarly, different merchant organizations put forth their views and supported the Delhi bandh
 21 march ko vyapaariyon kii kor cameti kaa gathan kiya jayega, jo ceiling or is maha andolan main taiyaariyon kaa nirnay legi
 This is not the first time that the traders have periodically protested against sealing, but this time, if on March 28, lakhs of traders from Ram Leela Maidan unite and raise their voice, then obviously the situation will change
 
 desh main mahaj 1,411 baagh shesh rah jane ke chintit kar dene vaale aankadon se ubarte hue ab nai gananaa main baaghon kii sankhya 1,706 paayi gayi he
 The number of this endangered wildlife species has increased by 12% in the last four years
 baagh gananaa-2010 ko vishwa kaa ab tak kaa sabase vyapak or atyaadhunik-vaigyanik tareeke se hua akalan qaraar dete hue paryaavaran or van rajya mantri jairam ramesh ne kaha, ‘baagh sangrakshan ke kshetra main beete chaar varsh main desh bhar main acha kaam hua he
 As a result, the average tiger population in the country now stands at 1,706
 ’ taaja gananaa ke anusaar, desh main ab 1,571 se 1,875 ke bich baagh hai
 Its average estimated figure is 1,706
 baaghon kii pichhali gananaa varsh 2006 main hui thi
 It was revealed that there are only 1,411 tigers left in the country
 taaja gananaa main sunderbans ko pehali baar shaamil kiya gaya he
 Releasing these figures at the inaugural ceremony of the International Tiger Conservation Conference, Ramesh said, "the number of tigers has increased by 12 per cent in the last four years
 yah ek acha sanket he
 'but he cautioned,' There is a grave danger in front of tiger protected corridors in the country
 baaghon kii sankhya sangrakshit kshetron main kam hui he
 a decrease has been observed in tiger habitat
 kul anumaanit sankhya main se 30 fisadi baagh 39 sangrakshit kshetron se baahar rah rahe hai
 Tigers are threatened by mining mafia and land mafia
 koyala khanan or sinchai pariyojnaayen bhi baaghon ke sangrakshan ke lihaaj se pratikul hai
 This was done in 39 tiger protected areas by the Ministry of Environment and Forests and the Wildlife Institute of India, Dehradun at a cost of nine crore rupees
 isamen 4,76,000 van karmiyon ne bhaag liya
 According to the census, there are 353 tigers in the shivalik-gangetic plains, 601 in Central India and the Eastern Ghats, 534 in the Western Ghats, the northeastern mountainous region and 148 in the flood-affected plains of the Brahmaputra and 70 tigers in the Sundarbans
 uttarakhand, maharashtra, assam, tamilnaadu or karnataka main baaghon kii sankhya main badhottaree hui he
 In particular, there has been a tremendous increase in the number of tigers in Maharashtra and Terai regions
 madhya pradesh or andhra pradesh main haalanki baagh kam ho gayi hai
 The number of tigers in Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Orissa, Mizoram, West bengal-north Bengal and Kerala is stable
 vruddhi ke lihaaj se pashchimi ghat aage hai
 In the previous census there were found to be 412 tigers, which has now increased to 534
 hoshangabad, baitool, narmada nadi ke uttari ghat or kanha kisli main baaghon kii sankhya main kaaphi giravat paayi gayi he
 Ramesh said, "the country needs an economic growth rate of nine percent
 isamen koi vivaad nahin he
 But especially in the context of tigers, we have to keep the right balance between environment and development
 ’kendriya mantri ne kaha ki chintaa kii baat yah he ki ranthambor, korbet or sariska sangrakshit kshetra se baahar bhi baagh vicharan kar rahe hai
 This increases the possibility of conflict between tiger and human
 baaghon kaa sangrakshan aane vaale varshon main hamaare liye badi chunauti hogi kyonki desh par janasankhyikee or vikaas ke lihaaj se dabaav bad rahaa he
 In such a situation, tiger will always be a threat to protected areas
 ramesh ne kaha ki camera traping ke jariye is baar baaghon kii 38 fisadi sankhya kaa pataa lagaaya gaya
 Pictures of 1,615 tigers, which are more than one and a half years old, were captured through the camera
 pichhali gananaa main samiksha ke liye har ek baagh kii 500 tasviren lee gayi thim, is baar vishleshan ke liye gananaa main shaamil 38 fisadi baaghon main se prayek kii 615 tasviren lee gayi hai
 He said that another encouraging thing is that in the states which have declared 'buffer zones' for tigers, there has been a good increase in the number of tigers
 ramesh ne ummid jataayi ki yojana ayog anupoorak bajet main baagh sangrakshit kshetron ke liye aavanton badhaayegaa
 We have to rehabilitate 50,000 families from within tiger protected areas elsewhere
 kosh ke abhaav main ab tak mahaj teen hajaar pariwaron kaa hi punarvaas ho paaya he
 Yaduvir Jhala of the Wildlife Institute of India, who led the tiger census, said that there has been a decrease in the number of tigers in protected areas
 pichhali gananaa ke mutabik baagh 93,600 varg kilometre kshetra main vicharan karte the
 Now the area has shrunk to 72,800 square kilometers
 dilli waalon par mahangaai kaa boj padane vaala he
 The Kejriwal government on Monday introduced a bill to increase VAT on 14 things in the assembly
 in 14 chizon main petrol or dijal bhi shaamil he
 Diesel currently has 12
5% VAT, which will be 30% VAT after this bill is passed
 jabaki petrol par abhi dilli main 20 fisadi waite lagata he, jise badhaakar 30 fisadi kiya jayega
 This will directly affect the common man's pocket
 hawaii eendhan, spirit, gasolin, bhatti kaa tel, mom (mombatti shaamil nahin), bharat main bani videshi sharaab, bhartiya sharaab, narkotics, lottery tikat, tambaakoo, gutkha, bidior 5 hajaar rupee semhangighadiyaan shaamil hai
 VAT is now 20 per cent on all these things, which will be 30 per cent after passing this bill
 bhartiya janata party ke adhyaksh amit shah ne congress par bhoomi adhigrahan vidheyak ko lekar bhram failaane kaa aarope lagaate hue kaha ki yah vidheyak kisaan virdohi nahin balki kisaanon kaa mitra he
 Addressing the elected representatives at the Good Governance Resolution program held on Sunday at Bhel Dussehra Maidan in Madhya Pradesh capital Bhopal, Shah said that Congress has always done politics in the name of farmers, but the central government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi is such a government Which is taking decisions in the interest of farmers

 India's great cricketer Rahul Dravid retired from Test cricket and retired from his 16-year international career
 purv bhartiya captain dravid test cricket ke itihaas main sabase zyada ran banane vaale duusare khilaadi hai or kai saalon se bhartiya madhyakram kii jimmedaari sambhaal rahe the
 The 39-year-old Dravid became the first player to retire in three aging Indian cricket players — Sachin Tendulkar and VVS Laxman — after a disappointing Test tour to Australia
 dravid ne vishesh rup se bulaai gai press conference main kaha, ‘‘main antarrashtriya or gharelu pratham shrenee cricket se sanyas lene kii ghoshnaa karata hum
 i played my first Test for India 16 years ago and today i feel that the time has come to move forward
 main bharat main ek aise ladke kii tarah hi tha, jo apane desh kii ore se khilne kaa sapana dekhtaa he
 i never thought that my journey would be so long and so perfect
 ’’ Dravid was also accompanied by BCCI president n Srinivasan and former Indian captain Anil Kumble
 unhone kaha, ‘‘koi bhi sapana akele puraa nahin ho saktaa
 i would like to thank those who taught me cricket and trusted me
 bengalooru main mere junior kochon or vibhinn junior rashtriya shiviron ne mujhe cricket ke prati itnaa jununee banaaya
 " dravid ne kaha, ‘‘antarrashtriya str par mere kochon ne meri cricket main sudhaar kiya or jisase mere vyaktitv ko nikharane main madad mili
 Physicians and trainers worked hard to get me fit, which is not an easy task, due to which i continued to play even in the last stages of 30 years
 ’’ unhone kaha, ‘‘bharat main chayankartaaon ko kabhi bhi koi shrey nahin miltaa, lekin unhone kai baar mujh par bharosa jataayaa, balki itnaa bharosa mujhe khud par nahin tha or main iske liye unka shukraguzaar hum
 All the captains i played led, led and inspired me
 sabase zyada main un tiimon kaa shukriya adaa karnaa chaahunga, jinke saath main khelaa
 '' dravid ne kaha ki unki team ke saathiyon ke saath kai shandaar yaaden judi hai, jisamen khel ke kuch mahaan khilaadi bhi shaamil hai
 He said, "I played with the Karnataka team in the early days of my career and those years were very entertaining and learning for me
 ’’ unhone kaha, ‘‘bhartiya team main main us shandaar yug kaa hissaa hokar bhaagyashaalee rahaa, jisamen bharat ne gharelu or videshi sarajameen par kuch behtareen cricket khelaa
 Many teammates became great, not only in India, but in the entire cricket world
 main unki kaaphi prashansa karata hum, maine unase kaaphi kuch siikhaa he or main cricket ko unke saath bitaye gaye samay kii shandaar yaadon or majboot dosti ke saath alavida kah rahaa hum
 This is a great gift
 ’’ Dravid said that he has always tried to maintain the sporting spirit of cricket
 unhone kaha, ‘‘cricket ke liye meraa ravaiya hameshaa saral rahaa he - team ke liye sarvasv do, sammaan se khelo or khel bhaavana ko hameshaa barkaraar rakho
 i hope i did some of this stuff
 main kai baar asafal rahaa, lekin maine koshish karnaa nahin choda
 So i am leaving it with a little sadness, but at the same time i am proud
 ’’ He thanked cricket fans for the support he received during his long career
 dravid ne kaha, ‘‘main yahaan or duniya bhar ke bhartiya cricket prashansakon kaa bhi shukriya karnaa chaahunga
 Cricket is lucky that you guys are fans of this and i am lucky that i got to play in front of you
 bharat kaa pratinidhitiv karnaa or khud kaa pratinidhitiv karnaa sammaan kii baat he or is cheez ko maine hameshaa hi gambhirtha se liya he
 '' australia kaa daura kaaphi niraashajanak rahaa, jisamen unhone 24
 Only 194 runs in eight innings at an average of 25
 isse bhi hatashapurna rahaa ki apni majboot takanic ke liye mashhoor dravid aath main se chah baar bold hue
 There was speculation about Dravid's future after the Australian tour and now his decision to retire has turned his eyes on another legendary batsman, VVS Laxman, for whom the tour was also disappointing
 dravid ne pichley saal england main vanade cricket se sanyas le liya tha or england ke khilaaf test shrunkhlaa ke dauraan unke shandaar pradarshan (teen shatak) ko dekhte hue unhen hairaani bharaa faisla karte hue vanade team main chunaa gaya tha
 Dravid, known as 'the Wall', made his debut in June 1996, though he would lead Jaipur franchise Rajasthan Royals in the fifth leg of the Indian Premier League
 tippaniyan Dravid has scored 13,288 runs in 164 Tests and is the second highest cricketer after Tendulkar (15,470 runs in 188 Tests)
 unhone 52
 Has scored 36 centuries and 63 half-centuries at an average of 31
 pakistan ke liye 270 ran unka sarvshereshth score rahaa
 He played ODI cricket from April 1996 to September 2011 and scored 34 centuries in 344 odis, 39 with 83 fifties
 16 ke ausat se 10,889 ran banaae
 Dravid also holds the world record for catching the most 210 catches in Test matches
 unhone slip kaichon main mark wa ko pahada tha
 Apart from this, he has 196 catches in odis
 yah poochne par ki unhone sanyas par faisla lene main kitna samay liya, to dravid ne kaha, ‘‘pichley ek saal se main prayek shrunkhlaa ke baad akalan kar rahaa hum
 When i arrived from Australia, i wanted to keep the emotions out of it
 maine sachin se or team ke saathiyon se baat kii or sabhi iske samarthan main the
 Dravid denied that poor form in Australia was the reason for his retirement
 unhone kaha, ‘‘mujhe nahin lagata ki meraa yah faisla siries par aadhaarit tha
 This was done after considering a lot of things
 ye faisle kaaphi chizon par aadhaarit hote hai
 '' 39 varshiya dravid australia ke niraashajanak test daure ke baad bhartiya cricket ke teen umradraj khilaadiyon- sachin tendulkar or vivies lakshmana main sanyas lene vaale pehle khilaadi ban gaye
 "I announce my retirement from international and domestic first-class cricket," Dravid said at a specially convened press conference
 maine bharat ke liye 16 saal pehle apana pehla test khelaa tha or aaj mujhe lagata he ki aage badhane kaa samay aa gaya he
 i was like a boy in India who dreams of playing for his country
 maine kabhi nahin sochaa tha ki meri yatra itani lambii or itani paripurna rahegi
 '' dravid ke saath bisisiai adhyaksh en shrinivasana or purv bhartiya captain anil kumble bhi maujuud the
 He said, "no dream can be fulfilled alone
 main un logon kaa shukriya adaa karnaa chaahunga, jinhone mujhe cricket sikhaaya or mujh par bharosa rakhaa
 My junior coaches and various junior national camps in Bengaluru made me so obsessed with cricket
 " Dravid said, "my coaches have improved my cricket at the international level and that has helped to enhance my personality
 physio or trainron ne mujhe feet banane ke liye kaaphi mehnat kii, jo aasaan kaam nahin he, jisaki badaulat main 30 kii umr ke antim padaav main bhi kheltaa rahaa
 "he never gets any credit to the selectors in India, but he trusted me many times, i didn't trust myself so much and i am thankful to him for that," he said
 main jitne bhi captainon kii aguwai main khelaa, unhone meraa netritv kiya or mujhe prerit kiya
 Most of all i would like to thank the teams i played with
 ’’ Dravid said he had many wonderful memories associated with his teammates, including some of the greatest players in the game
 unhone kaha, ‘‘main kariyar ke shuru ke dinon main karnataka kii team se khelaa or ve saal mere liye kaaphi manoranjak or sikh hasil karne vaale rahe
 "I was fortunate to be part of the glorious era in the Indian team, in which India played some of the best cricket at home and abroad
" team ke kai saathi mahaan ban gaye, bharat main hi nahin, balki puri cricket duniya main
 i admire him a lot, i have learned a lot from him and i am saying goodbye to cricket with great memories of his time spent with him and strong friendship
 yah shandaar bhent he
 '' dravid ne kaha ki unhone hameshaa cricket kii khel bhaavana ko barkaraar rakhane kii koshish kii he
 "my attitude to cricket has always been simple - give everything to the team, play with respect and always keep the spirit of the game," he said
 mujhe ummid he ki maine isamen se kuch chijen kii hai
 i failed many times, but i did not stop trying
 isliye main thode dukh ke saath ise chhod rahaa hum, lekin saath hi mujhe garv bhi he
 '' unhone apane lambey kariyar ke dauraan mili samarthan ke liye cricket prashansakon kaa shukriya adaa kiya
 Dravid said, "I would also like to thank Indian cricket fans here and around the world
" cricket bhaagyashaalee he ki aap log iske prashansak hai or main isliye bhaagyashaalee hum ki main aapke saamne khel paaya
 It is an honor to represent India and to represent myself and i have always taken this thing seriously
 ’’ The tour of Australia was a disappointment, with 24 of them
 25 ke ausat se aath pariyon main keval 194 ran banaae
 Even more frustrating was that Dravid, known for his strong technique, was bowled six out of eight times
 australian daure ke baad dravid ke bhavishya par atakalein lagaai ja rahi thim or ab unke sanyas lene ke faisle se nigahen ek anya mahaan ballebaaj vivies lakshmana par lag gai hai, jinke liye bhi yah daura niraashajanak rahaa
 Dravid retired from ODI cricket in England last year and was selected in the ODI squad after making a surprise decision given his brilliant performance (three centuries) during the Test series against England
 'da wal’ ke naam se mashhoor dravid ne june, 1996 main aagaaj kiya tha, haalanki vah indian premier lig ke paanchaven charan main jaipur kii frenchiji rajasthan royles kii aguwai karenge
 The comments dravid ne 164 test maichon main 13,288 ran banaae hai or vah tendulkar (188 test main 15,470 ran) ke baad sarvaadhik ran banane vaale duusare cricketer hai
 He 52

 madhya pradesh ke sabase charchitatirthayatridigvijay singh kii 3,300 kimi
 The long Narmada Parikrama concluded on 9 April
 unhen apni patni amrutha raay or kareeb 200 sahyatriyon ke saath narsinghpur jile main bermaan ghat par pahunchane main kareeb chah maheene lage
 During his pilgrimage, Pakkedigvijay did not make any political comment
 lekin ab vah vakt biit gaya he, so, congress or bhaajapa donon main hi is chatur raajnneetik kii agali chaal par nazren gadaaye hai
 But before that the former Chief Minister's return to the world of politics is expected to shed some light on the confusion in the Congress whether the party should announce the Chief Ministerial candidate in the assembly elections scheduled in October this year? Significantly, Jyotiraditya Scindia is in favor of announcing the face of the Chief Minister's post but Digvijay does not want that
 digvijay kii maujuudagi se pradesh congress main vibhinn guton ke bich matbhedon ke tikhe hone kii hi gunjaaish he
 Discussions have already begun on Scindia's absence in the party's Barman Ghat Bhandare
 digvijay ke is elaan se unke kheme ke kareeb aadha darjan mukhyamantri pad ke ummidavaaron ke baanchhein hi khilne kii ummid he ki ve mukhyamantri pad kii daud main shaamil nahin hai

 Further, even though Digvijay may say that the Narmada visit was a matter of his 'personal faith', experts believe that the difficult anti-hindu pilgrimage may have washed him away for some time
 ise unki dharmik aasthaa kii ore vaapasi bhi mana ja saktaa he
 This can be a problem for the BJP
 bermaan ghat par 9 april ko bhagava or pit vastradhari santon or dharmaguruon kaa baari sailaab dekhakar aisa lag rahaa tha, maano yah koi sangh parivaar kaa aayojan ho

 In September last year, Shankaracharya Swaroopanand Saraswati, who flagged off the yatra, referred to Chouhan's 'chopper journey' in the direction of Digvijay's orbit
 tikamgarh se aae purv vidhayak brajendra singh rathore kehete hai, ''congress kaaryakarta asann vidhansabha chunaavon ke disha-nirdesh ke liye netaaon kii ore taak rahe hai

 ahm yah bhi he ki apni 3,300 kimi
 During the yatra, Digvijay reached out to voters in 110 of the total 230 assembly constituencies of the state
 or ab ve 'rajnatik' yatra puri karne kii soch rahe hai
 He said, "I will pray in Omkareshwar and then go to Delhi

 iske jawaab main court ne kaha ki agar ek taraf janhit ho or duusari taraf kanoonee takneekiyaan, to adaalat kaa kaam dono main santulan bithaana he
 The CBI also opposed the Centre's plea in the court
 centre kii ore se likhit daleel di gai ki cese jude har nae saboot kii jaanch karnaa sibiai kii jimmedaari he, or ho saktaa he ki agle states report main unka zikr ho
 CBI counsel KK Venugopal was furious at this and said that CBI is an independent agency and words should not be put in our mouths
