 Turning the pages of history, the contribution of women in society has always been underestimated as compared to men
 haalanki is bhedbhaav vaale nazariye ke baavjood na to mahilaon kii kshamta par sawaal uthaae ja sakate hai or na hi unke yogadan kaa mahatv kam ho jaataa he
 In Indian history, from Azad Hind Sena regimental commander Lakshmi Sehgal to Kalpana Chawla, the image of women has been changed in front of the people
 dukh kii baat yah he ki aaj bhi apane dam par tamaam uplabdhiyaan hasil karne vaali mahilaon ko bharat main hi nahin balki duniyabar main purushon kii tulana main kai baar bhedbhaav kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 American women scientists have raised their voice against this discrimination being done despite equal hard work and talent
 ji haa yahaan mahila vaigyanik bhedbhaav ke khilaaf apana gussa jaahir karne ke liye apane kaarysthal par chehre par dadhi-moonch lagaakar pahunch gai
 Professor of Botany Alan Kareno has launched this campaign against discrimination against female scientists at the workplace

 The purpose of this project is to attract the attention of the people and tell them that the contribution of women scientists is not less than any male scientist
 in sabhi mahila vaigyanikon kaa kahana he ki tivi par export ke taur par aksar purush vaigyanikon ko hi bulaayaa jaataa he
 If this kind of behavior is just thinking of gender discrimination, then we too can shave ourselves and make them like them

 On Thursday, in the Rajya Sabha, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj gave a statement on the case of misbehavior in Pakistan from Kulbhushan Jadhav's family and exposed Pakistan's lies and impudence
 is maukey par puure sadan ek saath najar aayaa
 Congress also stood with the government on Jadhav's case
 rajyasabha main netaa pratipaksh gulam nabi aaazaad ne kaha ki jadhav ke parivaar ke saath pakistan jo saluk kiya he, use bardaasht nahin kiya ja saktaa
 People and people of the country are aware of the Pakistan Army, Government of Pakistan
 pakistan ne jis tarah se jadhav ke parivaar ke saath saluk kiya he, wo unka hi nahin balki desh ke 130 karod logon kaa apmaan he
 Ghulam Nabi Azad said that we are with the government in the Jadhav case
 hamaare vichaar alag ho sakate hai, lekin desh kii baat par ham ek hai
 Pakistan does not trust democracy
 jadhav parivaar ke saath jo vyavhaar rahaa,mangalsutra nikaalwanaa, bindi nikaalwanaa, juute nikaalwanaa desh kaa apmaan he
 The way Pakistan has treated the Jadhav family cannot be tolerated
 iske liye pakistan kii jitani ninda kii jaae kam he
 He said that Pakistan should assure our government that while Jadhav is in his prison, he should give assurance to protect it
 jadhav par pakistan ne farji aarope lagaae hai
 In order to save them, talk should be done in the international court in a strict and concrete manner and whatever is necessary is done
 bataa den ki videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj ne is mudde par sansad main bayaan diya
 In his address to the Rajya Sabha, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj said that the family of Kulbhushan Jadhav had met with diplomatic efforts
 sarkaar ne jadhav maamle ko antarrashtriya court main pesh kiya, jiske baad unpar jari kiye gaye faansee ke faisle ko taal diya gaya he
 In difficult times, the government is with the family, we have fulfilled the desire of the family members to meet Jadhav
 ye khed kaa vishay he ki mulaakaat main is tarah kaa vyavhaar kiya
 Sushma said that Pakistan made this meeting propaganda
 jadhav kii maa sirf sari pahenti hai, unke bhi kapade bhi badalawa die gaye
 The media was allowed to come close to mother and wife, which was against our terms
 mulaakaat se lautne ke baad maa-patni ne bataaya ki kulbhushan dabaav main hai
 Jadhav was speaking only by his captors who asked him to speak
 pakistan jadhav kii maa-patni ke juuton ke saath kuch sharaarat kar saktaa he
 Only human rights rules have been violated in this meeting
 pakistan main jane se pehle airport par do jagah maa or patni kii chacking hui, to kya jab koi chip nahin dikhaai di
 The entire House condemns this behavior of Pakistan
 kulbhushan ne apni maa ko dekhte hi sabase pehle poocha ki baba kaise hai kyonki jaise hi usne maa ko bina mangalsutra or chuudi ke dekha use shaq hua ki kahin kuch ashubh naa ho gaya ho
 Kulbhushan asked the first question how Baba is
 sushamaa ne kaha ki donon suhaganon ko ek vidhwaa kii tarah pesh kiya gaya
 Jadhav's mother wanted to talk to her son in Marathi
 jab wo baat karti thi, to interkom ko band kiya gaya
 Samajwadi Party President Akhilesh Yadav said that after meeting the victim's kin after the rape in Unnao case, our party will fight to get justice for the daughter
 akhilesh yadav shanivaar dopaher baad unnav jile ke bihar thana kshetra ke hindoonagar bhatan kheda gaanv pahunche
 Here, on December 5, he met the family of the girl who was burnt alive and consoled her and assured the family to take justice
 gauratlab he ki unnav jile ke bihar thana kshetra kii rahane vaali 23 varshiya yuvati par uske saath balaatkaar karne ke do aropiyon ne petrol daalkar aag laga di thi
 About 90 percent of the girl who was burnt was taken to Safdarjung Hospital in Delhi, where she died on December 6 night
 upi ke fatehpur main doharaaya gaya 'unnav cond', balaatkaar ke baad peedita ko jinda jalayaspa adhyaksh ne balaatkaar peedita ke pita se baatcheet main sthaneey prashasan dwaara kii ja rahi kaarywahi ke bare main bhi jaankaree lee
 On the question of sending him to Delhi for treatment, Yadav said that the government had sent the victim to Delhi not to save her life
 yahaan par raajnneeti na ho isliye dilli bheja
 SP chief said that it is our responsibility that the family gets justice
 jo doshi hai, unako kadi se kadi sajaa mili
 Indian wrestler Yogeshwar Dutt, who won a bronze medal at the Olympics, lost his first round on the last day of the Rio Olympics
 lekin is haar ke baavjood bhi wo padak kii daud main bane hue the
 Actually, this was possible by repechage
 repches se haarane vaale pahalwaan ke paas bhi bronj medal jeetne kaa mauka rahata he
 However this time, the Mongolian wrestler lost to the quarter-finals due to which Yogeshwar lost and Yogeshwar's chances of playing repechage were over
 aakhir kya he repches?kushti main repches wo niyam he jiske tahat agar koi khilaadi shuruaati daur main haar jaataa he or usase jeetne vaala khilaadi final tak pahunchataa he to haarane vaale ko apni takat aajamaaish kaa doosraa miltaa he
 The word is derived from French which means rescue
 kushti main yah us khilaadi ke liye bachaav kaa ek or mauka hota he jo shuruaati mukaable main haar jaataa he
 Of the three medals won by repechage, repechage is the formula due to which India has won medals in the Olympic Games three times so far
 2008 main hue beijing olympic ke dauraan yah shabd pehali baar bhartiya khel premiyon ke jubaan par chadha
 Sushil Kumar then got a chance under the same rule despite losing in the initial round and he managed to win the bronze
 iske chaar saal baad 2012 khud yogeshwar ko isi repches niyam ne bronj dilaayaa tha
 Yogeshwar lost to Russia's Basikh Kudukhov in the Round of 16
 kudukhov final main pahunche or silver jeeta to yogeshwar ko isi repches ke niyam ke tahat bronj ke liye khilne kaa mauka mil gaya or unhone yah mauka nahin ganvaaya
 In Rio this year, Sakshi Malik also managed to win the medal due to this repechage
 quarterfinal main valeria coblova se haarane ke baavjood bronj ke liye khilne kaa mauka mila kyonki coblova final main pahunch gai thi
 Why repechage happens in wrestling itself? Now the question arises that why the repechage rule is used only in wrestling, why not in other sports? Like other sports in wrestling, the draw between the wrestlers is not according to their ranking
 yah aakasmik drow ke tahat tay kiya jaataa he ki kin do pahalawaanon ke bich muqabla hoga
 In tennis, two top-ranked players never clash in the early stages, but in wrestling it is possible and that is why this repechage rule is applied here

 com / a8lbprvi75— Ellen mcnamara (@ellenkctv5)september 10, 2017 Laldas, a secular shrine in Sherpur, a village in Alwar district, has now become a new center of communal tension in Rajasthan
 yah gaanv us gopalgarh se 22 kimi dur he, jahaan pichley saal sitambar main masjid par hui police firing main 10 mev musalmaan maare gaye the
 On July 10, Rajasthan Police, which came in two hundred vehicles, kept this small village with about two dozen houses camped for three days
 oparation kaa netritv karne vaale jaipur (gramin) police mahanireekshak saurabh shrivastav kehete hai, ''aisa namaaj padhane se rokane or hindu pratikon ko hataane kaa prayaas taalane ke liye kiya tha
 "this shrine is a complex of walls built around the tomb of Saint Laldas
" 1597 main janme sant laldaas muslim mev mata pita kii santan the or unhone laladaasi panth kii sthapana kii thi
 The place is visited by both Muslims and Hindus, and is managed by a committee of Hindus
 ek adhed mev musalmaan idris saad iske pujari hai
 This shrine is located in Alwar, the stronghold of Meo, which is the constituency of Union Minister of State for Home Bhanwar Jitendra Singh
 is parisar main laladaasi panth ke sansthaapak laldaas, unki kuch santanon or unke parivaar ke sadasyon kii darjanon kabren hai
 Major P
, the then settlement officer of Alwar
 dablue
 Paulette writes in the Alwar Gazette that Laldas was a Meo Muslim by birth, who followed Hindu customs
 unka laladaasi panth kabir panth kii tarah tha or apane kism ke baaki kisi sampradaay kii tulana main kahin zyada udaar tha
 Today the sect has seventeen declared assets in Alwar and 30 other properties in northern, central India
 dharm parivartan karke hindu se musalmaan bana rajasthan kaa mev samudaay sahishnu or dharmanirpeksh he, jo itane vashor se hinduon ke saath behad najdiki saanskrithik sambandhon ke saath faltaa-phulataa rahaa he
 But not properly dealing with Gopalgarh violence by Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot and then appeasing radical Muslims by not allowing writer Salman Rushdie to attend the Jaipur Literature Festival has encouraged communal sentiments to fundamentalist groups in the region
 shrivastav kehete hai, ''hamane gopalgarh jaisi sthiti taali he
 The organizers of the proposed meeting under the banner of Sadbhavana Manch are communal and have the support of fundamentalist groups like Tabligi Jamaat
 unamem hindu or musalmaan donon netaa hai jo gopalgarh sankat kii jad main the
 The police filed an FIR against non-bailable offenses such as hurting religious sentiments, inciting hatred and rioting against two leaders of the Sadbhavana Manch - People's Union of Civil Liberties (PUCL) vice-president Maulana Hanif and Dalit activist Surajmal Kardam Is recorded hanif ne apane chhipe hone kii jagah se 15 july ko india today ko batayah ''ham 12 june ko parisar main murtiyon sthapit kiye jane kaa virodh karne ke liye 11 july ko parisar ke paas ek vishaal baithak karne ja rahe the
 Permission was sought from the administration for this
 swami agnivesh, ramvilas paswan or udit raaj jaise netaaon ne vahaan aane ko manjuuri di thi
 We want the peaceful coexistence of Hindus and Muslims, in which Muslims are allowed to offer Namaz there
 ''sthaneey prashasan ke mutabik, saare aitihaasik record yahi bataate hai ki vahaan kabhi namaaj nahin padhi gai
 Hence the demand for the platform is like to disturb communal harmony
 15 july ko india today ko vahaan hindu devataaon kii koi murti nahin mili
 Rajasthan PUCL general secretary Kavita Srivastava said in a press release issued late evening of July 15 that the dispute over the Laldas shrine was merely a government ploy to cancel this meeting, to discuss the Gopalgarh massacre, embarrassing the government Had to face it
 idris kehete hai ki ''puraa vivaad sarkari chaal he, jiskaa makasad mewan main se kattarpathiyon ko khush karne ke liye dharmasthal ko apane niyantran ke tahat laana he
 "the way all the devotees offer sheets, oil, incense sticks, sugar and rice to the tomb, the special character of the shrine is clearly visible, but Hindus bow their heads and do circumambulation, which Muslims do not
 ab tak kisi ne is par aapatti nahin kii ki vahaan koi kis tarah puja karata he
 Ravi Kapoor, president of Baba Laldas Temple Development Committee, insists that using the atrocities on Muslims in Sadbhavana Manch Gopalgarh is going to provoke their sentiments
 iraadaa is dharmasthal ko apane kabje main lene kaa he, kyonki pichley kuch varshon main yahaan daan or chadhaave kii rakam badhkar 15 lakh ru
 It is an annual event
 idris kehete hai ki ek samay unhen deepak jalaane ke liye tel kii bheekh maangani padati thi
 He says, "the devotees used to come, but in those days they did not offer
 ab hamen kai drum tel mil rahaa he isiilie kai daavedaar ho gaye hai
 The India Today team found that people in and around Sherpur have started calling the shrine by different names, in terms of their vested interests
 jaise samadhi, mandir, idgah, majaar yaa dargah
 They have also disputed the name of the saint: Laldas or Lal Khan? Muslim groups tried to capture it in the past as well
 1945 main kuch musalamaanon ne adaalat main yah kehete hue ek maamla daayar kiya tha ki unhen parisar main namaaj or muslim sanskaron kii anumati di jaani chahie
 But in October 1947, his case was dismissed by the Munsif Magistrate of Alwar, saying that like Kabir Panth, Laldasi was neither a Hindu nor a Muslim
 ve vaishnavon ke kareebi the
 He ordered that no Islamic sign or prayers would be allowed
 1966 main is sthaan kii dekhbhaal karne ke liye ek trust bana tha, jisamen zyaadaatar hindu the
 The support of the local Meo was taken in the trust
 1986 main mev musalamaanon ke ek samooh ne parisar main sthit idgah jaise najar aane vaale ek manch par ek nikaah ke baad namaaj ata kii
 The then priest was fired at that time
 uski jagah idris ko rakhaa gaya
 The number of Hindu devotees increased
 2001 main sirf do kimi dur sthit gaanv naugaanv ke hinduon ke kattarpanthi samooh ne trust kaa prabandhan apane haathon main le liya
 He interacted with the eight Meo and two Hindu families living in broken shackles inside the complex to get money and land and build pucca houses just outside the complex, so that the devotees could be relocated
 unhone shraddhaluon ke liye rasoi, canteen or thaharne kii suvidhaayen viksit kin
 Now the number of devotees in the three major fairs exceeds two lakh each time
 isse paise to zyada aane lage, lekin sthaneey mev isse alag-thalag pad gaye jo iske aarthik vikaas se khud ko kataa hua mahasoos karne lage
 Sallu, 89, who was shifted out of the premises in 2008 and who has built a huge house outside, is worried about giving the right to worship here to his nephew Idris
 puja karne ke adhikaar ko lekar ek baar ek pratidwandvi mev ke khilaaf adaalat main chale ek maamle main, sallu ne daawa kiya tha ki vah laldaas ke vanshaj or gaiyr-musalmaan hai or puja karne ke unke tareeke main vishwaas karte hai
 Now all his anger is on the Hindu dominated management
 unki maang he, ''yahaan namaaj hoti thi or pehali manzil par honi chahie
 "the specialty of this shrine is now under threat
 glamer kii duniya ke chamak se shaayad hi koi batch paata ho

 In a good and strong relationship, your partner becomes your lover, best friend and more
 aapaki life main aisi bahut kam hi chijen rah jaati hai jo aap apane partner ke saath share naa karnaa chaahate hon
 It doesn't matter how long you've been with each other
 aapako kabhi bhi ek-duusare ke liye choti-choti chijen karnaa band nahin karnaa chahie
 Let's know what 3 things you should do to keep the relationship beautiful
 
 Complimenting each other - Giving positive feedback to each other, praising each other for small things always strengthens your relationship
 shaayad aapako lagata ho ki ab aapako apane partner ko bataane kii jarurat nahin he ki vah kitna achche dikh rahe hai yaa phir unhone kitni madad kii he
 It is very important to maintain excitement and enthusiasm in the relationship
 ek-duusare ke saath eemaandaar rahen-sach kadava hota he lekin sach sach hota he
 One day the truth of everything comes to the fore
 aap apane partner se sach naa chhipaaen chaahe vah koi choti-baat hi kyon naa ho
 Always give them the right opinion
 ho saktaa he kai baar sach bolne par aap donon kii us vakt ladaai ho jaae lekin lambey samay main aapkaa rishta majboot hota chalaa jayega
 Learn to forgive each other - no one is perfect and we all have some bad habit from which we cannot even get rid of it
 iskaa ye matlab nahin he ki aapako khud ko sudhaarney kii koshish kerani hi chhod deni chahie
 But to keep pushing your partner to improve all the time and keep on telling their mistakes may not prove right
 aap apane partner ko ye bataaen ki aapako kya pasand nahin he lekin ek sakaaratmak andaaj main jaise ki tum aise zyada achche lagate ho
 If a partner's habit is not really making a big impact on your life, then you can forgive your partner for those small mistakes

 The terrorists are coming from UP and Bihar
 upi-bihar rajya sarkaron ko isaki jaanch kerani chahie par wo kuch nahin karatin
 Vehicles are stolen from Mumbai whenever elections are held
 par unka istemaal koun or kis liye kiya ja rahaa he isaki jaanch honi chahie
 We blame the Mumbai Police undeservedly
 ' raaj thakare ke is bayaan main upi bihar par kai aarope hai or maharashtra police ko bachaane kii koshish
 If a person who calls himself a politician says such things, then it is bound to think if he is right for this role
 raaj ne aage kaha he, 'aatank kaa kendra kahaan he
 Where terrorist conspiracies are made
 ye sab bihar main hota he

 raaj aage kehete hai, 'ye keval ek chunavi mudda nahin he
 The entire city is troubled by the floods of up-bihar
 haa ye baat digar he ki ye mudde jaruri taur par chunaav main bhi aaenge

 Later everyone repeated my statement
 par tab kisi ne hallaa nahin kiya
 BJP and JDU are very angry with Raj Thackeray's statement

 Raj Thackeray's fire rate is very high
 bihar kii satta par kabiz jediu ke mukhiya sharad yadav bhi raaj ke bayaan se gusse main hai
 When Raj Thackeray called the governments of UP and Bihar useless, the Chief Minister of Bihar said this nonsense
 chunavi baaji ke liye desh kii ekta or akhandta ko daanv par lagaana raajnneeti nahin ho sakati
 Everyone knows that terror has nothing to do with religion, caste, region but hatred

 sutron ke mutabik, maamle kii jaanch kar rahi sibiai ne supplementary chargeshit main amit shah ko aaropee nahin banaaya he
 On the question of Amit Shah's role in the Ishrat Jahan encounter case, senior CBI officials made it clear that there is no legally logical evidence on the basis of which they should be named as accused in the charge sheet
 sutron ne kaha ki amit shah kaa naam ek mukhya aaropee diji vanjaaraa ke is daawey ke baad saamne aayaa ki purv mantri ne unhen tathaa anya police adhikariyon ko dhokhaa diya, jinke khilaaf sibiai ne vibhinn muthbhed maamalon main maamla darj kiya
 The CBI recently questioned BJP general secretary Amit Shah in the Ishrat Jahan encounter case
 baad main, sibiai ne ek bayaan jari karke kaha ki ishrat jahaan muthbhed maamle ke supplementary chargeshit par koi antim faisla nahin hua he
 CBI spokesperson Kanchan Prasad said that no final decision has been taken yet to present the supplementary charge sheet
 yah maamla ab bhi vichaaradhin he
 Earlier, the CBI sought opinion from the Law Ministry amid the finalization of supplementary chargesheet in the Ishrat case
 sibiai ne poocha ki gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi ke sahyogi amit shah ko namit nahin karne kii sajeesh main khufia vibhaag ke adhikariyon ke khilaaf abhiyojan ke liye manjuuri kii jarurat he yaa nahin
 CBI sources said that they have gathered enough evidence about the role of IB officers in the conspiracy behind the encounter, but there are conflicting views on whether Special Director Rajendra Kumar (now retired) and three other officers p Mittal, MK Sinha And whether prosecution against Rajiv Wankhede requires the approval of the Ministry of Home Affairs
 unhone kaha ki ek najariya yah he ki chunki kumaar kathith aparaadh ke samay sakriy taur par seva main the, isliye grih mantralay se unke khilaaf abhiyojan ke liye manjuuri kii jarurat he
 Sources said another opinion is that since he retired in July this year, the agency could go ahead with his charge sheet without seeking approval for prosecution
 unhone kaha ki agency aadhi-adhuri sthiti ke saath aage nahin bad sakati, isliye maamle main spashtataa ke liye ise kanoon mantralay ke paas bheja gaya he
 Sources said that as far as the role of officers in the alleged conspiracy is concerned, the agency has gathered sufficient evidence against them
 unhone kaha ki agar kanoon mantralay ko lagata he ki supplementary chargeshit daayar karne se pehle grih mantralay kii manjuuri kii jarurat he, to sibiai kathith adhikariyon ke khilaaf abhiyojan kii manjuuri maangane kaa aagrah kar sakati he
 However, if the ministry feels the opposite, the agency will go ahead with its supplementary charge sheet

 When 250 such booth workers are ready, call me, i will introduce you to Rahul Gandhi
 kyon bhai yah baat janchegi?'' phir puraa sabhaagaar taaliyon se gunj uthaa
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections and the strategist Prashant Kishore, who came up for discussion during the Bihar election last year, by making a successful strategy for the election campaign of Chief Minister Nitish Kura , are now trying to revive the lifeless Congress in UP
 congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi kii pahal par farvari main upi congress kii chunavi ranneeti or prabandhan kaa jimmaa sanbhaalane ke baad prashanth apane duusare daure par 21 april ko do din ke liye lakhanu pahunche
 He took the feedback for the first time by communicating directly with leaders of every level of the Congress
 shuruaati ranneeti ke tahat prashanth ne jameen se cat chuki congress ko booth str tak khadaa karne kaa tanabana buna he
 The Congress is not in a mood to repeat the mistakes of its 2012 election campaign
 us vakt rahul gandhi ne sattarudh mayawati sarkaar ke khilaaf akele puure pradesh main maahaul bana diya tha lekin nichle str par sanghathan kii gairmaujuudagi se party ko iskaa laabh nahin mil paaya tha
 In the last 30 years, as the Congress's grassroots organization was disintegrated, its seats also kept decreasing in the same proportion
 pichley loksabhaa chunaav main upi se keval do siten jitkar nunatam str par pahunchane vaali congress agle vidhansabha chunaav se pehle dhul jhaadkar dobaaraa khadaa hone kii taiyaari main jute gai he
 Prashant Kishore arrived in Lucknow on March 10 for the first time at every booth
 lakhanu ke mal avenue sthit pradesh congress mukhyalay main pradesh upaadhyaksh, mahaamantri, jila or shahar adhyakshon ke saath baithak main unhone sabhi ko 14 panne kaa ek propharma thamaya or netaaon ke kshetra se judi kai jaankariyaan maangi
 Prashant had asked everyone to provide a list of 20 Congress workers in every assembly constituency by March 31, who would be ready to take any responsibility
 iske saath congress ke sabhi frontal sanghathanon ke jila prabhariyon se bhi prayek vidhansabha kshetra main do-do sadasyon kaa naam dene ko kaha
 In this way, on average, a core team of 30 people is being prepared in every assembly constituency, which will not only make inroads to every section of the society at the grassroots level, but will start implementing the decisions of the leadership without delay
 iske alaava upi ke kul sava lakh boothon main prayek par kam se kam ek yuva kaaryakarta ko chihnit kar use ahm jimmedaari dene ke prayaas bhi shuru hue hai
 For this, the leaders and frontal organizations seeking a Congress ticket in the next assembly elections have been asked to prepare a list of one worker each in 250 booths of each assembly constituency within a month
 congress kii kamiyon ko dhundhakar use dur karne kii ranneeti banane kaa kaam prashanth akele nahin karenge balki pehle charan main unke saath 30 kaaryakartaaon kii team lakhanu main deraa daalane ja rahi he
 The office for this team is being prepared on the first floor of the State Party Headquarters on Mall Avenue
 prashanth kii yah team booth str tak party kii gatividhiyon kii sidhi monitering karegi
 200 seats on target, says a senior Uttar Pradesh Congress leader, "initially, the focus will be on 200 assembly seats
 ye ve siten hongi jahaan congress chunaav ladgaye kii acchhee haalat main hogi
 There is a multi-level strategy to select candidates for these seats
 pehle ve ummidavaar honge jo pichhlaa vidhansabha chunaav jite the yaa phir duusare number par rahe the
 However, if the third-ranked candidate got good votes, then he will have a strong claim in the next election
 iske alaava jila panchayat sadsy kaa chunaav jeetne vaale congressi netaa agar apane vidhansabha kshetra se chunaav ladgaye ko icchhuk hai to un par gambhirtha se vichaar hoga
 After all, leaders who have worked effectively as district and regional incharge of Congress can also be given ticket for assembly elections
 18 farvari ko lakhanu pradesh congress mukhyalay main dalit conklev main shirkat karne pahunche rahul gandhi ne congress vidhayakon ke saath baithak kii thi
 In this, the mlas questioned the attitude of the former mps of the party and suggested them to contest the next assembly elections
 yah baat varisht netaaon tak pahunchi
 In a meeting held in the presence of Prashant on 1 March in Delhi, the former minister, who lost the election from a parliamentary constituency adjoining Lucknow, stole a direct question in his speech
 is
 to kya jo kuch bachaa he, vah bhi khatm kar dena chaahate hai?''is baithak ke baad taiyaar ho rahi ranneeti main varisht netaaon ke sidhe vidhansabha chunaav ladane kii baat to kuch kamjor ho gai par in netaaon kii sifarish par ek hi ummidavaar ko tikat diya jayega
 In any case, they will have to win that seat, this will also determine the stature of senior leaders in the party
 chehre par kashmakangale vidhansabha chunaav se pehle congress uttar pradesh main koun-sa cheharaa pesh kare, is par kashmakash jari he
 Both Rahul Gandhi and Prashant Kishore wanted to field Priyanka Gandhi Vadra as the face of the Congress in the state, but the possibility has been put to a complete halt in a meeting with senior leaders in March
 party kaa thinkatank 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav se pehle kisi pradesh main priyanka ko sidhe taur par utaarne par bhi apekshit nattejey na milane kaa jokhim uthaanaa nahin chahta
 Currently, the exercise of handing over the command of a well-known face among a Brahmin or public has started the exercise of the election campaign committee formed for the 2017 assembly elections
 1 march ko dilli main hui baithak main shirkat karne vaale upi ke varisht netaaon kaa naam to pehle se hi tay tha lekin rahul gandhi ne isamen digvijay singh kaa naam bhi joda tha jo 2012 ke vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan upi congress ke prabharee the
 In the last moments of the meeting, former Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dixit was also sent to attend the meeting
 dikshit ke shaamil hone se in atakalon ko bal mila he ki unhen bataur brahman cheharaa upi congress main koi badi jimmedaari saunpi ja sakati he
 Also Rajeshpati Tripathi, Pradeep Jain Aditya, Raj Babbar, R

 In order to boost the prospects of the Congress in the next assembly elections, the coalition of smaller parties like Janata Dal (united), Peace Party, Mahan Dal is being decided
 congress pradesh main apni sahyogi partiyon ke liye vidhansabha kii 403 siton main se 100 siten chhodeygi or baaki par puure damakham ke saath chunaav maidan main utregi
 In a meeting with Prashant Kishore on April 22 at the state Congress headquarters in Lucknow, excited women leaders called him Hanuman
 ab dekhnaa he ki prashanth kii 'sanjivani booti' uttar pradesh main congress main kitni jaan phoonk paati he
 The Election Commission on Wednesday issued a show cause notice to Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal
 badal ko yah notice is vajah se jari kiya gaya he kyonki unhone kathith taur par bayaan diya tha ki chunaavon main kharch to karodon rupee kiye jate hai par jaankaree bahut kam paison kii di jaati he
 Badal had also allegedly asked people to give secret funds for publicity
 badal dwaara pratham drushtya aachaar samhita ke ulanghan kiye jane kii baat maanate hue ayog ne unhen 2 may kii shaam tak apane kathith bayaan par safai dene ko kaha he
 If Badal did not file a reply by the evening of May 2, the commission would take action without informing him
 punjab congress ke ek netaa kii shikaayat par karrwai karte hue ayog ne kaha ki adarsh aachaar samhita kaa praavdhaan spasht he ki 'sabhi party or ummidavaar aisi bhi gatividhiyon se parhez karenge jo bhrasht hoti hai or chunavi kanoon ke tahat aparaadh hoti hai

 com / p8gfl1mr9x krichar film ke diarector vikram bhatta pehle apni film ko ‘animal’ naam dena chaahate the lekin akshay kumaar abhinit film ‘joker’ ke diarector shiris kunder ne yah naam pehle hi apane naam se registerd kar rakhaa tha
 When Vikram asked Shirish to take this name, he refused it
 is par vikram bhatta kaa kahana he, "jab maine is film kii kahani likhi tabhi maine ise yah naam de diya tha
 One of the motives for giving this film its name was that it would not give people a hint of a horror film anywhere and for me it was the most important thing
 jab mujhe pataa chalaa ki yah naam shiris ne apane naam par register kar rakhaa he to main unki bivi farah khan se mila jo meri acchhee dost hai
 When i talked to him, i came to know that Shirish himself is working on a film of this name
 main peeche hat gaya
 "the biggest role in naming the film 'creator' is played by Krishna, the daughter of Vikram Bhatt
 vikram bataate hai, “jaahir-si baat he jab shiris ne mujhe is tital ko dene se inkaar kar diya tab main soch hi nahin paa rahaa tha ki ise kya naam diya jaae
 At the same time my daughter Krishna suggested the name 'creator' to me
 mujhe laga mujhe jo chahie tha vah mil gaya
 To be honest, i do not think any other name better than this name would have been suitable for this film
 ’’is silsile main nirmaataa bhushan kumaar kaa bhi yahi kahana he, ‘’vikram is film ke liye ‘animal’ naam chaahate the lekin mujhe lagata he ‘krichar 3di’ is film ke liye parfect tital he

 Are engaged with ’’ isamen kaha gaya ki iskaa parinaam saamne he ki modi virdohi alag-thalag pad gaye hai, unki vishwasaneeyata khatm ho gai he or gujarat puri tarah is hindutvanishtha, samajasevi va kushal prashaasak rajaneta ke saath khadaa he
 This editorial, published with the title 'how many more ordeals of Modi', says that after the SIT report, at least now this propaganda against Modi should be ended, because this white lie has been exposed on many occasions
 paanchajnya ne kaha he, ‘‘pradhanmantri pad ke liye rahul ke mukaable modi ke paksh main desh kii janata ke hone kii sachai ke saamne to congress kii shah par juty puri secular jamaat kaa modi virdohi dushprachaar kaa shadyantr dhwast hota dikhaai pad rahaa he
 In the name of Modi, who used to gather these elements in the process of tricking the Muslims and gathering their votes, today Modi stands as a big challenge for the Congress due to his Hindutva perseverance and public good administrative skills, in front of which the Congress leadership looks extremely dwarfed

 Panchajanya has said, "in the face of the fact that the people of the country are in favor of Modi for the post of Prime Minister, the conspiracy of the anti-modi propaganda of the entire secular group on the instigation of the Congress seems to have collapsed

 The relationship between Malaika Arora Khan and Arbaaz Khan, once known as an example for married couples, has come to a rift
 18 saal kii shaadi ko malaika ab todna chaahati hai, par maamla talaak kii rakam par aakar ruk gai he
 Actually, the amount that Malaika has asked for as alumni amount is getting out of Arbaaz's humiliation
 malaika ne alumini ke taur par arbaj se 15 karod rupee maange hai
 malaika-arbaaz, who arrived in Bandra Family Court, did not, according to a report published in Sulhadanik Bhaskar, 3 in the amount of alumina demanded by Malaika from the court
 5 karod rupee kaa mumbai ke bandra ilaake main flats, bete ke naam par 2

 iske alaava malaika ne bete kii padhai ke liye uske 21 saal ke hone tak har maheene 5 lakh rupee kii raashi alumini ke taur par maangi he
 Malaika wants a Rs 5 crore alumini for herself
 malaika-arbaj ke talaak kii taarikh kaa hua khulasadusri ore arbaj kaa kariyar thahar gaya he or jo filmein bataur produsar unhone banaai hai unka paisa arbaj ke bhai salmaan ne diya tha
 In such a situation, Arbaaz's lawyer made it clear in the court that Arbaaz is not able to fulfill this demand of Malaika
 2016 rahaa celibrities ke talaak kaa saal
 
 
 Let me tell you that Arbaaz has told in court that he has tried his best to save the marriage, but Malaika is adamant on divorce

 India hoped that Pakistan would take action on the information provided last month regarding the Mumbai terror attack
 grih mantri pi chidambaram ne samvaadadaataaon se baatcheet ke dauraan ummid jataayi ki pakistan kuch karegaa, use kuch samay dijie

 unase pakistan ko bharat kii ore se mumbai aatanki hamale ke bare main pakistan ko di gayi soochnaaon par uski ore se ab tak kii gayi karrwai ke bare main sawaal kiya gaya tha
 He said that i had gone to Pakistan four weeks ago, i should wait
 chidambaram ne 25 june ko islamabad main pakistan ke grih mantri rahamaan malik se baatcheet kii thi
 During this period, Pakistan was made aware of the additional information given by Lashkar terrorist David Headley in the revelations made about the Mumbai attack

 21 mlas of the Aam Aadmi Party are hanging the sword of going to the legislature
 aise main dilli kii aap sarkaar ne chunaav ayog main arzi lagaakar kaha he ki is maamle main usko bhi party banaaya jaae
 The comments 13 june ke dilli kii aap sarkaar kii taraf se daakhil halafname main kaha gaya he ki kyonki is maamle main appointing athurity dilli sarkaar he isliye yah maamla sidhaa hamase judaa he isliye chunaav ayog dilli sarkaar ko is maamle party banaae
 In this affidavit it is argued that no economic benefit was given to the mlas, therefore they do not come under the purview of the post of profit, whereas in this case, the petitioner Prashant Patel has opposed this application of the Delhi government and said that 'delhi The government's intentions are not right and this application is an attempt to prolong the case, which the Commission should not accept at all
 aapako bataa den ki 21 sansadeey sachiv ko laabh ke pad ke daayre se baahar karne kaa dilli sarkaar kaa bill raashtrapati khaarij kar chuke hai or is maamle main chunaav ayog abhi sunwaayee kar rahaa he
 In the affidavit filed by the AAP government of Delhi on June 13, it has been said that because the appointing authority in this case is the Delhi government, this matter is directly related to us, so the Election Commission should make the Delhi government a party in this matter
 is halafname main daleel di gai he ki vidhayakon ko koi aarthik laabh nahin diya gaya isliye wo laabh laabh pad ke daayre main nahin aate, jabaki is maamle main yachikakarta prashanth patel ne dilli sarkaar kii is arzi kaa virodh kiya he or kaha he ki ' dilli sarkaar ke iraade thik nahin hai or ye arzi maamle ko lanbaa khinchne kii koshish he, jisko ayog ko bilkul nahin maananaa chahie
 Let us tell you that the President of Delhi Government's bill to exclude 21 parliamentary secretaries from the scope of the post of benefits has been rejected and in this case the Election Commission is still hearing
 aapako bataa den ki 21 sansadeey sachiv ko laabh ke pad ke daayre se baahar karne kaa dilli sarkaar kaa bill raashtrapati khaarij kar chuke hai or is maamle main chunaav ayog abhi sunwaayee kar rahaa he
 There can be many reasons behind breaking your relationship
 chunki aapako apane andar chhipi galtiyaan najar nahin aati, is vajah se samay rahete aap unhen sudhaar nahin pate
 Let us tell you what are the reasons that can lead to your relationship
 1
 If you are not giving good response to your partner on a new job, promotion or any other good news, then your relationship is in danger
 dhyaan rakhen ki partner kii har baat par par unhen sahi pratikriya dene se rishton kii door majboot hoti he
 2
 dhyaan rakhen ki aapkaa partner aapaki har activity par najar rakhata he
 If you do not respond to them while being active on social media, then it can be quite bad for your relationship
 aise main aakhir main tang aakar log rishta khatm kar lenaa hi behatar vikalp samajhate hai
 3
 aksar log apane partner ko biji shedul kii vajah se paryaapt time nahin de pate, lekin jab wo apane kisi dost yaa kareebi ke saath samay baantne lagata he to ye baat aapako chubhane lagati he
 After this you start to counter them for everything, which causes a breakup soon
 4
 When you met him on the first date, your contact was very tremendous, but slowly it starts to fade away
 aap unase nazren milakar baat karne kii bajaae idhar-udhar dekhakar baaten karte hai
 This is also a sign of your relationship deteriorating

 The Shiv sena-ncp government can be formed with the support of the Congress, Raut said, there is political differences with the Congress but not enmity
 a new political equation is coming up in the state after the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) refused to form the government in Maharashtra
 Where, with the support of the Congress, there is a possibility of formation of Shiv sena-ncp (nationalist Congress Party) government
 sutron ke hawaale se khabar he ki shivasena-ensipi kii sarkaar congress ke samarthan se ban sakati he, jisamen vidhansabha adhyaksh kaa pad ensipi ke paas ho saktaa he
 The Congress strategy will depend on the decision of Sharad Pawar, who is scheduled to meet Sonia Gandhi after a meeting of NCP mlas on Tuesday

 The mandate was given to the alliance in Maharashtra but Shiv Sena is not ready to support BJP
 lihaaja wo sarkaar nahin bana sakate
 Earlier, Shiv Sena President Uddhav Thackeray reached Mumbai's The Retreat Resort to meet his mlas
 vidhayakon ko kharid-farokht se bachaane ke liye yaheen rakhaa gaya he
 Amidst all this, Uddhav Thackeray indicated in the meeting that there would be no compromise on the cm's chair
 uddhav thakare ne vidhayakon se kaha ki ab ham or palki nahin uthaaenge
 Shiv Sainiks will sit in that palanquin themselves

 After the meeting, Kharge came in front of the media and said that the Congress had got the mandate to sit in the opposition but did not forget to say that the opinion of the legislators would be conveyed to Sesonia Gandhi
 shivasena-congress main talmail?jahaan tak shivasena kii baat he to wo congress ke saath sarkaar banane ko taiyaar he
 Sanjay Rauten said in the press conference that there are political differences with the Congress but he is not their enemy but if the Shiv Sena and the Congress form a government together, they will also need the help of the NCP
 sharad pavaar ke ghar par ensipi kor group kii baithak hui
 Pawar has made it clear that he will say something only after talks with the Congress leadership

 Union ministers will be out of the NDA? If Congress sources are to be believed, the party will consider talks with the Shiv Sena only if it separates from the bjp-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and one of its ministers in the Union Cabinet, Arvind Sawant, will resign
 congress netaa hossain dalwai ne kaha he ki "congress ko rajya main uplabdh sabhi vikalpon par vichaar karnaa chahie
 "in such a situation, questions are beginning to be raised whether the Shiv Sena will go out of the NDA to form an alliance with the congress-ncp and form a government in Maharashtra? sabase bade do dushmano shanti vaarta ke liye singapore pahunch chuke hai

 There is also a considerable difference in the age of the two enemies
 jahaan trump kii umr 71 saal kaa he, to vahiin kim kii umr unase aadhi yani mahaj 34 saal he
 In spite of all this, now the whole world wants that the meeting of the two on 12 June be in a happy atmosphere and the conversation gives way to peace

 Karat told reporters here, "the government's intention is to hold back the decision taken on FDI till the end of the winter session of Parliament
" lekin ham chaahate hai ki sarkaar is faisle ko nirast kare
 "karat alleged that the government approved FDI in the retail business because it had promised it to the US
 unhone kaha ki unki party is mudde par sansad ke bheetar or baahar apana virodh darj karaati rahegi
 "we will take this issue to the people
 " bhartiya communist party (bhakpa) ke varisht netaa gurudas dasgupta ne kolkata main patrakaron se baatcheet main kaha ki epadiai ke mudde par sansad main jari gatirodh ke liye pradhanmantri manmohan singh jimmedaar hai
 He said that the government should withdraw this decision
 dasgupta ne kaha, "sansad main gatirodh ke liye jo log vipaksh ko jimmedaar tehra rahe hai, unhen main kahana chaahunga ki is gatirodh ke liye pradhanmantri manmohan singh jimmedaar hai
 "he said," It is true that we are opposing FDI but at the same time we also want Parliament to run

 or faisla sarvasammati se liya janaa chahie
 "our position is clear," Dasgupta said
 ham chaahate hai ki sarkaar is faisle ko puri tarah waapas le
 "he said that just as Manmohan Singh was responsible for the indo-us nuclear deal, he is also personally responsible for the FDI decision in the retail business
" kyonki arthvyavastha ke udaarikaran main unki bhoomika ahm rahi he
 Describing the decision to stop FDI, made public by West Bengal Chief Minister and Trinamool Congress President Mamta Banerjee, Dasgupta also criticized the government for this
 unhone kaha, "kendriya vitt mantri pranab mukherjee or pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee ke bich hui nijee baatcheet saarvajanik hoti he or koi yah sabit karne kii koshish kare ki falaan raajnneetik party ke dabaav ke aage sarkaar ko apana faisla badalanaa padaa, to yah puri tarah 'aniatik' he
 "meanwhile, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) questioned why Congress President Sonia Gandhi and party general secretary Rahul Gandhi are silent on the FDI issue
 bhaajapa netaa arun jetali ne yahaan ek kaarykram main kaha, "sarkaar ne 25 navambar ko khudara kaarobaar main epadiai kii anumati dene kaa faisla liya, tab se lekar ab tak mujhe is mudde par congress adhyaksh (sonia gandhi) or unke mahasachiv (rahul gandhi) ke vichaar jaanane kaa mauka nahin mila, jabaki rahul ko bhavishya kaa netaa mana jaataa he
 "he said," Whether they (sonia and Rahul) are happy with the government's policy or not, the matter is not yet known to the people
 " rajyasabha main vipaksh ke netaa jetali ne yah bhi kaha ki sarkaar bina soche-samajhe faisla leti he jisase aarthik sudhaaron ko nuksaan pahunchataa rahaa he
 He said, "people in the government think that they will achieve anything in one stroke
 " ullekhneey he ki is silsile main mukherjee ne somvaar ko bhaajapa ke varisht netaaon laalkrishna adwani evam sushamaa swaraj or marxvaadi communist party (makapa) ke netaa seetaram yechuri se baat kii thi
 It is believed that Mukherjee apprised him of the government's decision to stop the decision on FDI and sought his cooperation in the smooth conduct of parliamentary proceedings
 vahiin, vipaksh ke netaaon ne suzav diya tha ki sarkaar ko is mudde par apana rukh spasht karne ke liye ek sarvadaleey baithak bulani chahie
 Mukherjee had on Saturday informed Trinamool Congress President and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee that the government will hold back the decision on FDI until a consensus is reached
 ullekhneey he ki kalaadhan, mahangaai or epadiai sahit anya muddon par virodh or hangaame ke chalate sansad ke sheetakaaleen satr kaa kareeb aadha samay nasht ho chukaa he

 The bill stuck due to political opposition! The bjp-led NDA government at the Center wants to bring an amendment in the 'right to Fair Compensation and Transparency Act, 2013' in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement, making agricultural land for some areas including industrial corridors The acquisition should be easy, but it is facing political opposition to it and due to this the amendment in Parliament has been stuck
 jetali ne kaha, ‘ek ahm suzav yah aayaa ki centre ko aam sahmati banane kaa prayaas karnaa chahie lekin rajya iske liye zyada samay tak intjaar nahin kar sakate
 "the Finance Minister said," If the Center fails to pass this bill with consensus then it should be left to the states

 i am pained
 aaj maine party adhyaksh amit shah se mulaakaat kii or main unako dhanyavad karata hum ki vah ghanton tak meri baton ko sunate rahe
 Amit Shah solved my problem and suffering
 main unako dhanyavad detaa hum
 Significantly, Amit Shah said on Wednesday that Giriraj Singh will contest the Lok Sabha elections from Begusarai itself
 unhone kaha ki unki (giriraaj singh) sari baton ko maine suna he or sanghathan unki sabhi samasyaon kaa samaadhaan nikaalega
 i wish him all the best for the election
 bataa den ki giriraaj singh apni seat badale jane ko lekar naaraaz bataae ja rahe the
 He is currently an MP from Nawada
 party ne aagaamee loksabhaa chunaav ke liye unako begsuray seat se tikat diya he
 Kanhaiya Kumar is fighting against Giriraj on CPI ticket
 kanhaiya kumaar purv main jeenyu ke chaatr sangh adhyaksh rahe hai or modi sarkaar ke dhur virdohi hai
 Kanhaiya Kumar also recently said that his fight is not with RJD but directly with Giriraj Singh
 giriraaj singh ke begusarai se chunaav naa ladane par unhone tanj bhi ksaa tha
 In fact, this time the Nawada seat has gone to the account of Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan's LJP under the NDA alliance
 yahaan se LJP ke chandan kumaar chunavi maidan main hai

 aadhunik bharat ke nirmaataa / ganatantr diwas visheshlata mangeshkar kaa hindi filmi geeton ke liye vahi yogadan he jo gaalib kaa urdu adab ke liye or makabool fida hossain kaa painting ke liye
 He has always topped the list of veterans working in this field, be it Mohammad Rafi, Kishore Kumar, Mukesh, Manna Dey or his own younger sister Asha Bhosle
 ve un sabase aage nikal gayi, ek ke baad ek filmon main hit gane gaati raheen or saat dashak se bhi zyada vakt se bharatiyon ko yaadgaar pal detii rahi hai
 She was the ghazal of Madan Mohan's composition and Naushad's gourmet
 jab ham apni ankhen band karke hirani jaisi ankhon vaali sharmila tagore ko 'kuch dil ne kaha' gaate hue sunate hai to vah aawaaj main maheen kampan liye lata mangeshkar hoti hai jo (anupama) film main sharmila ke sankochi or mitbhaashi vyaktitv ko pratibimbit karti hai
 And then the same Lata pyar ki darna kya (mughal-e-azam) in Himmati, the rebel and the chirpy voice
 jab unhone i mere vatan ke logon gaaya to na keval pandit nehru kii ankhen bhig gayi balki puure desh ke jakhmon par maano maraham lag gaya
 But there is a lot more to Lata's story
 unhone 1940 ke dashak main 13 saal kii umr main filmon main kadam rakhaa
 His motive then was to help a family suffering after the death of his father
 unhone tab ek aise film udyog main apni jagah banaai jahaan asahmati ke swar zyada hote the or jahaan pitrusatta haaavee thi
 He started a new phase of change by getting trained playback singers like him instead of singing actors himself
 jab unki 'khyaati uthaae ja unke sitam' (andaaj) or 'aayega aane vaala' (mahal) jaise gaanon ke baad aasmaan chune lagi to na keval unki aawaaj kaa jaadu failane laga balki badlaav kii bayaar bahane lagi
 He also struggled with royalty for playback singers and a separate Filmfare Award for him
 jab unki urdu ko lekar sawaal uthe to unhone apane liye ek shikshak rakhaa
 She would practice the songs until her talafuj was fixed
 isi abhyaas ne unhen parfect bana diya
 Lata Mangeshkar is the same for all of us today, perfect

 -ek baar ek bacchee apane pita ke saath baahar nikali thi
 Amidst the rain and the crowd, the father said that son hold my hand
 is par beti ne use kaha meraa haath pakadana
 When the father asked why the daughter, then the daughter said that due to the crowd, my hand can be released, but if you hold it, the hand will not touch
 isi tarah jab manhat swami ne meraa haath pakad liya to mujhe kya chintaa he
 - This temple has become infinitely beautiful in its time

 India's growth rate in the last two decades has been between 6 and 7 percent
 vikaas ke lihaaj se ise acha maan sakate hai
 But did our laborers also benefit from it? Absolutely not, because if found, there would not have been such a big difference between minimum wage and salary
 antarrashtriya shram sanghathan kii 'india veg report' bataati he ki 1993 se 2012 tak sangathit kshetra ke vetan main jaisaa ijapha dekha gaya, vaisaa asangathit kshetra main nahin rahaa
 So, the apathy of the working class is the same today, as it used to be in the 90s
 kai rajyon main ise prati vyakti aay se joda jaataa he lekin rajyon ke bich itnaa antar he ki kuch sateek nahin kaha ja saktaa
 For example, the daily wage is Rs 783 in Haryana and Rs 320 in Gujarat
 jabaki gujarat kahin se bhi haryana se kam sampann nahin he
 The question is, who got the benefit of 'liberalization' and 'free Market Economy' in the country when a large section of the society remained deprived? It is evident that a handful of the people of India who are organized sector personnel got full benefit of salary facilities and this benefit increased at a quadruple speed day and night
 magar afsos ki hamaare majdoor aaj bhi usee doraahe par khadey hai, jahaan desh kabhi 90 ke dashak main hua karata tha
 However, there are many states where workers are given a respectable amount
 isamen dilli awwal he jahaan akushal shramikon ko 538 rupye or kushalon ko 652 rupye tak die jate hai
 According to the information given in Lok Sabha on 11 February 2019 in which states, in Andhra Pradesh, Rs 69 is given to unskilled laborers and Rs 895 to unskilled laborers
 assam main 244 rupye akushalon ke liye or 485 rupye atikulash shramikon ko die jate hai
 In Bihar, Rs 181 is given to unskilled and Rs 282 to unskilled laborers
 chhattisgarh main 234 rupye akushal or 338 rupye atikushal mazdooron kii dihadi he
 In Gujarat, unskilled laborers get 100 rupees and skilled people get 293 rupees
 haryana main yah raashi 326 rupye or 417 rupye he
 In Jharkhand, unskilled get Rs 229 and Atikushal get Rs 366
 anya pradeshon kaa aankada dekhen to karnataka main akushal shramikon ko 262 rupye or atikushal mazdooron ko adhiktam 607 rupye milte hai
 The unskilled in Kerala get from Rs 287 to Rs 510
 vahaan atikushal shramik ko 284 se lekar 556 rupye tak milte hai
 In Madhya Pradesh, this amount ranges from Rs 283 to Rs 419
 maharashtra main akushal shramikon ko 180 rupye se lekar 315 rupye tak milte hai
 In Odisha, the unskilled get 200 rupees and the unskilled laborers get 260 rupees
 punjab main 311 rupye or atikushal ko 415 rupye dene kaa praavdhaan he
 In Rajasthan this amount is 207 and 277 rupees respectively
 uttar pradesh main yah raashi 228 rupye or 324 rupye he
 In Bengal, unskilled laborers get Rs 211 and non-skilled workers get Rs 370
 dilli main sabase zyada akushalon ko 538 rupye or kushal shramikon ko 652 rupye milte hai
 The above figures released in the Lok Sabha show that most of the states are where the wages are still very low which is insufficient to run a laborer's family
 jaise andhra pradesh or telugana main akushal shramikon ko maatr 69 rupye dene kaa praavdhaan he
 100 rupees in Gujarat and 55 rupees in Puducherry
 isse itar ek sawaal yah bhi he ki rojgaar paae logon main vaise logon kii sankhya kya he jinhen ek nishchit tankhwaah milti he or vaise kitne log hai jinaki dihadi ke bhi laale padate hai? 2011-12 kaa ek aankada bataata he ki rojgaar praapt kul logon main kamobesh 62 fisadi log hai jo 'cajual workars' yani chaltau kaam main lage hai
 It is clear that the number of employed people in India may have increased, but most people still spend their time in hard work beyond casual, informal or social security
 alag alag report se yah baat bhi saamne aati he ki jaisaa antar vetanbhogi varg or dihadi varg main dekha jaataa he, vaisaa hi desh ke alag alag rajyon, mahila-purush or padhe likhe-anpadh main bhi dekha jaataa he
 This means that wages in some state of the country are very good, and in some states it is quite unfulfilled
 mahilaon kii tulana main purushon kii mazdooree zyada to anpadhon kii apeksha padhe likhe maalamaal hai
 Whether cities and villages, women are still angered that they get less salary than men
 rajyon main mazdooree main baari antartej vikaas dar kaa sambandh prati vyakti aay se bhi hota he
 Like to say that by increasing the growth rate, the income of the people increases, due to which their living and living are modern and convenience
 lekin isamen ek dikkat ye he ki majdoor ko kitna mila, ise ek teesraa paksh tay karata he
 These third parties are central or state governments
 vetan sambandhi kaayade-kanoonon main nunatam mazdooree kaa praavdhaan vaidhanik to he lekin badhyakaari nahin he
 Therefore, every state fixes wages at its own level
 isse kya yah maane ki jo rajya jitna sampann hoga, vah mazdooron ko utani hi dihadi degaa?yahaan jaananaa jaruri he ki 1993-94 ke baad adhiktam or nunatam mazdooree kaa antar rajyon main kaaphi dekha jaataa rahaa he
 Take Haryana, Assam, Jharkhand, Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab, Tamil Nadu and Gujarat as an example
 in rajyon main prati vyakti aay main gahari asamanthaayen hai
 In Haryana, where per capita income is Rs 1,48,485, in Assam it is Rs 54,618
 iskaa asar ausat dihadi par bhi dekha jaataa he
 The daily wage in Haryana is Rs 783 and in Assam it is Rs 607
 jharkhand main prati vyakti aay 56,733 or dihadi 543 rupye he
 The per capita income in Jammu and Kashmir is 62,857 and daily wage is Rs 495, in Punjab the per capita income is Rs 1,14,561 and daily wage is Rs 362
 tamilnadu main prati vyakti aay 1,30,197 or mazdooree 388 rupye he
 The per capita income in Gujarat is Rs 1,24,678 and wages are Rs 320
 prati vyakti aay se pare mazdooron kii dihadiupar ke aankadon se spasht he ki rajya bhale hi samrudh hon, vahaan prati vyakti aay bhale gadhi ho lekin yah mehnakash logon kii mazdooree main canwart nahin hota
 If this were the case, the wages in Gujarat would not have been much lower than in Haryana because there is a slight difference in the per capita income of the two states
 agar prati vyakti aay paimaana hota to is list main assam, jharkhand or jammu kashmir ko sabase neeche hona chahie tha kyonki ye garib pradesh hai
 but it's not like that
 isse saaf he ki rajya sarkaron par yah nirbhar karata he ki vah mazdooron ke kalyaan kaa kitna khyaal rakhti hai or unhen kitna phayda pahunchaati hai
 The reason for this difference is that India has a good record in wages and wages
 vikasshil deshon main bharat akelaa raashtra he jisane nunatam vetan kanoon (1948) lagu kiya he
 The purpose of this law is to reduce poverty and inequality, but surprisingly, the minimum wage rates are many times higher than the states
 ek aankade ke mutabik bharat main takreeban 1709 alag alag vetan daren hai
 Experts say that if there is severe pay related exploitation in India, then different rates are the reason behind it
 mil majdoor ke liye alag to khetihar majdoor ke liye alag, eent bhatta majdoor ke liye kuch to raaj mistre ke liye kuch
 Separate wages in Bihar and some more in Arunachal
 ye asamanthaayen bataati hai ki mazdooree ke slab main jitne antar honge, shoshan kii gambhirtha utani badhegi
 India is currently plagued by this
 rahan-sahan kaa kharch or nunatam mazdooreebharat main mazdooree, vetan kaa rishta jis din vyakti ke rahan sahan se jud jayega, us din asangathit kshetra kaa sunaharaa din hamaare saamne hoga
 While fixing the minimum wage or salary, it is rarely taken care of how many members are there in the house, what is their basic expenditure, whether food, water, medicine, clothing, odhwa etc
 can be borne by the minimum wage
 iskaa dushprabhav hota he ki koi majdoor rojgaar main hote hue bhi apane rosemara kaa kharch nahin dho paata or karj ke janjaal main fansata jaataa he
 Poverty removal campaign for such people is nothing more than mere imagination
 truti kahaan or sudhaar kii gunjaaishkyabharat jaise mazdooree pradhan desh main takreeban 65 pratishat log hi nunatam vetan kanoon main nihit hai
 The remaining 35 percent are out of it
 aise logon kii dasha or bhi kharaab he kyonki mazdooree se vanchit rahane ke saath inhen kanoonee suraksha bhi praapt nahin he
 The pay law may be statutory but not binding
 jab tak ise badhyakaari nahin banaaya jayega, tab tak rajyon ke maathe par bal nahin padenge or unhen isaki jarurat bhi shaayad mahasoos nahin hogi ki 'cost of living' ke aadhaar par mazdooron ko ek sammanjanak raashi di jaae

 Gillani, while giving information about his half-brother, said, "I was also shocked by his decision to rename or rename at one time

 Gilani said, "soon after Dawood's birth, my father's posting ended and the couple moved to Pakistan
" 1960 ke dashak main mere pita or daud kii maa kaa talaak ho gaya or parivaar ke bade bujurgon ke anusaar vah phir se america chali gayi

 andriani22) on Feb 6, 2018 at 5:44 am PST film industry main tyoharon main filmon kaa relies hona jitna khaas hota he, utana hi khaas hota he filmon main tyoharon kaa hona
 All such films have been made in Bollywood, in which festivals are mentioned somewhere
 chahen wo diwali ho yaa holi yaa phir id
 There are many Bollywood movies in which Eid is mentioned
 ham bataa rahe hai aisi hi kuch filmon ke bare main
 1- Pakeeja - Pakeeja film holds a special place in the Bollywood industry
 film main minaa kumari ne naragis kaa role play kiya tha jo ek tawayph rahati he
 In the film, it was tried to show how things are done from the eyes of a tawaif
 uske liye samaaj ke kya myne hai tyoharon ke kya myne hai, pyaar ke kya myne hai
 How she lives in society and walks on thorny paths in the way of love
 2- makabool-makabool film main pankaj kapur, om puri, nasiruddin shah, irfan khan, piyush mishra or tabu jaise kalakaar shaamil the
 The festival of Eid is celebrated in the film and even in a mafia family, it is a custom to celebrate the festival with love
 kis tarah se pandit or mullah donon hi insaaniyat kii garima banaae rakhte hai or tyohaar kaa luft saath main uthaate hai
 3- Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gum - Shah Rukh Khan is from a big family
 unhen kasbe main rahane vaali ek musalmaan parivaar kii ladki se pyaar ho jaataa he
 This point remains the centerpiece of the film and the weft of the film is woven on it
 film main badhaaiyon kaa silsilaa dikhaada gaya he or id kaa celibrasion bhi, jisase apane aap hi chahare par muskaan aa jaati he
 4- ghulam-e-mustafa - Nana Patekar played the role of a very true Muslim in this film
 film main unke abhinay kii khub saraahna hui thi
 How do they protect a poor Marathi family even though they belong to the second community? ye apane aap main hi insaani taur par ek bahut hi gahari baat he
 In the film, Nana's character was seen as a true Muslim who worshiped Namaz
 5- sanam bevafa-salmaan khan kii ye film ek lav story thi
 It was a story of mutual love between two families and true love of two hearts
 ladaai jhagadon ke bagaiyr pyaar kii bhashaa samaaj main ek khaas keemat rakhti he
 How two loved ones win by fighting family is worth watching in the film
 fasebuk ke spokeperson ne kaha- 'ham hameshaa se hi chaahate hai ki fasebuk ke jariye log dost, parivaar se juden
 The voice clip will be a new medium
 'bataa den, fasebuk iske alaava ek nae feechar par bhi kaam kar rahaa he jiskaa naam phase ricognishan feechar he
 After turning on the Face Recognition feature, if you post any picture on Facebook without tagging, you will get a notification
 phase kii pahchaan kar aapako alert karne kaa kaam karegaa
 The photo and video sharing feature was introduced in 2017 in the Facebook-owned instant messaging platform whatsapp, similar to Snapchat Stories
 ise watsap states ke naam se utaara gaya tha
 It works like Snapchat stories, where the shared photos and videos are automatically deleted after 24 hours
 kabhi-kabhi ham chaahate hai ki apane doston yaa rishtedaaron dwaara share kiye gaye content ko seve kar len lekin screenshot karne ke alaava koi rasta nahin bachataa he
 Because no option to save is provided by whatsapp
 lekin iske do tareeke hai, jisase aap share kiye gaye media files ko seve kar sakate hai
 The first of two ways to save a media file is through a file manager app and the second is through a third party app
 lekin aamtaur par log third party ap ko upyog bharosemand nahin maanate hai
 Because it has many loopholes associated with privacy
 khayr file manager ap vaale tareeke ke bare main ham yahaan aapako bataa rahe hai, jiske jariye aap aasaani se media files ko seve kar sakate hai
 The photos and videos of the status are saved on the smartphone for a while by whatsapp and these files are removed after 24 hours
 keval aapako in files ko phone se delit hone se pehle kisi or file main transfar karnaa he
 a lot of smartphone brands like Samsung, LG, oneplus, Oppo, Vivo incorporate file manager app in their operating system
