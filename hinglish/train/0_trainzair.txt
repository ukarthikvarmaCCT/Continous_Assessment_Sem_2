 Smartphone companies are now launching exclusive smartphones online

 In such a situation, online stores are now ready for action
 ET kii ek report ke mutabik cellphone retaillers ne tay kiya he ki ab wo un brands ko nahin bechenge jo online discount degaa
 Update: Realme has said in a statement given to Tech till date that the company is currently operational in 3,000 stores in 35 cities and it is being expanded further
 statment ke mutabik, 'realme yang brands he or ham customers ko best experience dena chaahate hai
 According to the policy, we sell products on a low margin
 distribyootors se is tarah kaa coment sun kar ham dukhi hai, kyonki abhi retaillers ke saath baatcheet shuruaati daur main he
 However, we agree that we cannot give more margins, therefore we cannot collaborate
 'iti products bechney vaale dilers ke mutabik unhone kuch top brands - del, lenovo, echpi or esar ke saath deal kii he jiske tahat online keemat par hi products cell karne kii baat he
 Arvinder Khurana, president of the All India Mobile Retailers Association (AIMRA), said, "offline cellphone stores will not cooperate with brands that will continue to launch exclusive online
 ye aam taur par ofline model se saste hote hai or aisa nahin bhi hota he to vahaan logon ko in modells par discount die jate hai'
 Let us tell you that AIMRA represents 25,000 stores across the country
 reports ke mutabik bharat ke popular ofline retaillers sangeeta, poorvika or big si ne tay kiya he ki wo online focusd brands Realme ke smartfones nahin bechenge
 Saket Kapoor, who represents 20,000 IT retailers, is also the secretary of the Federation of All Indiaichi Association
 ye kehete hai, 'is egrement main online exclusive modells ke liye koi scope nahin he or agar nirmaataa ise launch karata he to use pehle ofline ofer karnaa hoga'isi tarah sangeeta mobile ke managing diarector subhash chandra ne kaha he ki unhone Realme ke smartphone na bechney kaa faisla kiya he
 This is because online focused brands offer significantly lower margins
 aapako bataa den ki south main ye ofline retail kaaphi popular he or iske 600 stores hai
 The battle between online and offline is also because customers generally get more discounts on online shopping
 inamen exange ofer, cashbek or no cost iemai jaise ophers shaamil hai
 Along with this, e-commerce companies give huge discounts on smartphones from time to time
 isliye customers saste main kharidne ke liye online kaa ruukh karata he or isse ofline retaillers kaa nuksaan hota he

 (inputs bhashaa se) (from inputs language) jammu-kashmiramen kisi party ko bahumat nahin mila he
 BJP leaders are trying to fulfill the dream of Hindu CM in Jammu and Kashmir by aligning with People's Democratic Party (PDP) and National Conference (NC), but both these parties do not appear to be very flexible on the condition of BJP
 She has been aise main ek sawaal yah bhi uth rahaa he ki kya jammu-kashmir raashtrapati shashan kii ore bad rahaa he?28 siten jitkar sabase badi party banakar ubhari pidipi ne to bijepi ko dotuk kah diya he ki siem uski party kaa hoga
 In such a situation, all hopes of BJP winning 25 seats are based on NC, but differences are emerging in BJP in Omar Abdullah party
 party netaa devendra singh rana ne to pidipi ko samarthan kaa elaan tak kar diya he
 It remains to be seen whether Devendra is going away from the party line and saying that he is supporting the PDP, or is Omar Abdullah also agreeing with him? However, no formal announcement has been made by NC on support to PDP
 duusari ore jaankaar yah bhi kah rahe hai ki agar siem pad ko lekar gatirodh yun hi jari rahaa to rajyapal ke paas raashtrapati shashan ke alaava koi or vikalp nahin bachegaa
 Looking at the situation so far, no political party seems confident about forming the government
 'mishan 44+' ke saath chunaav main utari bhaajapa bhale hi 25 siton par simat gai ho, magar satta paane kii sabase zyada lalak yahi party dikhaa rahi he
 Ram Madhav, former Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) spokesperson and now BJP general secretary, is camping in Kashmir
 ab sawaal yah uthta he ki sarkaar banane ke liye koun si do partiyaan galabahiyaan daalengi
 Initially it seemed that the National Conference and the BJP had reached an agreement, but many mlas of Omar's party have opened their front against the BJP
 sabase zyada virodh hindu siem ko lekar ho rahaa he
 Now let's talk about PDP
 guuruuvaar ko bhaajapa mahasachiv ram madhav ke srinagar pahunchane ke baad varisht pidipi netaa tathaa saansad mujffar hossain beg ne unke saath do daur kii baatcheet kii
 The PDP spokesperson made it clear that he had met Ram Madhav in private, but the matter did not work, so he said that the meeting should not be politically interpreted
 doosraa sawaal yah he ki kya bijepi ko satta se alag rakhane ke liye pidipi, ensi or congress haath milaayenge? in sawaalon ke jawaab tabhi milenge jab jammu-kashmir main sarkaar banane kii koi pahal karegaa, lekin maujuuda halaat to raashtrapati shashan kii ore hi ishaara kar rahe hai
 What are the assembly equations? * Total seats in Jammu and Kashmir assembly 87 * To form a government, a magic figure of 44 is needed * PDP is the largest party, having 28 seats * BJP winning 25 seats * Congress is second Bar 12 and 15 seats near National Conference (input-ians) landan ke emirates stadium main khele gaye champions lig antim-16 ke pehle leg main barsilona ne arsenal ko 2-0 se haraa diya

 Rock solid defenseman Barca's defense of Barcelona's young German goalkeeper Ter Stegen also made good defense with his defenders

 Despite playing well in Barcelona's dominance of the match, Arsenal failed to penetrate Barca's defense to the end and Barcelona took the first leg 2–0
 match main barsilona kaa dabadabaa pajeshan se lekar shots tak main saaf dikhaa
 While Barca took 66 percent possession as well as 15 shots in this match, the Gunners were able to take only 34 percent possession and eight shots

 The final of the IPL-8 has been played and Mumbai Indians has become its winner
 isamen koi shaq nahin ki mumbai indiens champion kii tarah kheli
 He defeated Chennai not one, not two, but three times in the tournament
 lekin kya aap jaanate hai ki is sab ke baavjood mumbai kii jeet, na
 
 
 not
 
 
 ise chennai kii haar kahen to zyada acha rahegaa, iske peeche ek totaka kaam kar rahaa tha jo pehle plaof ke din hi likh diya gaya tha
 Yes, if this trick is considered correct then it was decided on the first playoff day that Mumbai will become the winning team of this tournament
 chaliye aapako bataate hai ye puraa maajaraa kya he
 The IPL started in 2008 and since the first, second qualifier and eliminator system has been introduced in the IPL, the team that has reached the final after playing the eliminator has not been able to win this tournament
 iskaa matlab yah hua ki jo team pehla kwalifire jeet kar sidhe final main pahunchati he vahi antat toornament kaa vijeta banati he
 It cannot be seen merely as a trick
 pichley paanch main se chaar baar jis team ne pehla kwalifire jeeta vahiin final bhi jiti
 Chennai Super Kings in 2011, Kolkata Knight Riders in 2012 and 2014 then Mumbai Indians in 2015
 keval 2013 main chennai super kings aisa karne main kaamyaab nahin rahi
 Mumbai Indians became the winner that year, winning the second qualifier to advance to the finals
 ise is tarah bhi dekha ja saktaa he
 The IPL is a tournament lasting about one and a half months
 is dauraan khilaadi lagaataar khelte rahane kii vajah se thakaavat ke shikaar ho jate hai or jis team ne pehla kwalifire jeet kar final main apni jagah banaai use kaaphi samay mil jaataa he
 The team refreshes and is fully prepared for the finals
 duusari ore jo team kwalifire haarane ke baad alimineter se guzarati he use toornament ke final main pahunchane ke liye jahaan ek match adhik khelnaa padataa he vahiin uske khilaadi bhi duusari team kii tulana main zyada thake hue hote hai
 Now waiting for the British Parliament to complete its investigation so that the picture is clear

Condemning PM Narendra Modi's recent remarks about former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, senior Congress leader Sam Pitroda on Sunday said he felt ashamed of being a Gujarati due to unrestrained rhetoric about a late figure

 He told reporters at the Indore Press Club, 'I am ashamed as a Gujarati by the inconsequential remarks made by the current Prime Minister of the country about former Prime Minister Rajiv on Saturday
 main bhi usee gujarat se taalluk rakhata hum, jis soobe main mahatma gandhi kaa janm hua tha
 Pitroda, a 77-year-old communications tech expert who was a close advisor to Rajiv Gandhi, said, "I feel very sad to see that people coming from Gujarat have fallen so low about a late figure (rajiv Gandhi) You can lie like this

 It is noteworthy that on the question of the Prime Minister and BJP national president Amit Shah being given a clean chit by the Election Commission continuously in separate cases of alleged violation of rules by making controversial statements during election campaign, Pitroda gave the head of this autonomous constitutional body Self-contemplation advised
 unhone kaha, 'yah baat khud chunaav ayukta ko sochni he ki vah desh ke chunaav ayukta hai yaa vah kisi siyaasi party kii numaaindgi karte hai?'indian oversij congress ke pramukh pitroda ne sattarudh bhaajapa par loktantr ko hijank karne kaa aarope lagaate hue kaha ki ham dekh rahe hai ki sarkari sansthaanon par kabja kar liya gaya he
 The heads of these institutions are scared
 unhone kaha ki pichley paanch saal main modi sarkaar ne bhaajapa ke chunavi vaade nahin nibhaae
 This government only lied and did no notable work
 iske baavjood jab yuva vidhyaarthee modi se prabhavit ho jate hai, to hamen bada achraj hota he
 Pitroda said on a question that yes, absolutely true and right thing, it is our weakness that we are not able to reach our point to the youth, but we cannot spend crores of rupees to spread lies on social media like BJP 
 vahiin, purv vitt mantri or congress ke varisht netaa pi

 ’ As we are getting away from books, we have started to show more love for books
 jo log kehete hai ki unhen kitaaben padhanaa acha lagata he, unamem vaaki das fisadi log hi vaaki niyamit taur par kitaaben padhate hai
 The rest read about the books
 hindi main sthiti or buree he
 Ask a person who claims to be a book lover, what is the last book he has read, then he will take the name of Premchand in a tizzy and will mention some of his story when asked the name of the book
 jaahir he, yah vah jamaat he jo kitaab padhati nahin he, pustak diwas bhale manaa le
 i have seen many conscious looking people, journalists, anchors - they know the names of some famous authors, but do not know about their writings or their books
 pustak melon main, sahitya samarohon main vaastavik lekhak nahin hote, aksar ve mashhoor hastiyaan hoti hai jo kisi or vajah se lokapriy ho gai hai or is lokapriyata kaa phayda uthaate hue kitaaben likh le rahi hai
 At the center of the growing literary festivals in the country are often similar film celebrities, TV anchors and leader-cricketers
 lekhak kahin haashie par hota he jiskaa kaam bas in samarohon ko vaidhata pradaan karnaa hota he
 Well it is true that books were not always read very much
 kam se kam sau saal kaa yahi sach he
 The twentieth century has been the century of cinema, not of literature
 filmon ke maamuli se maamuli kalakaar kisi bhi lekhak se zyaada mashhoor rahe
 The books that the film world put on, became famous
 sharatchand kaa bahut ausat qism kaa upanyaas 'devdas' film banane ke baad clasik ho gaya
 Few people remember his far better novels such as 'remaining Questions', 'path contenders' or 'characterless'
 'tamas' or 'chandrakanta' jaisi kritiyon ko tab vaastavik shoharat mili, jab un par serial bane
 The world of books was basically confined to schools, colleges and universities
 ve sadiyon tak shiksha or gyaan kaa iklauta madhyam bani raheen
 Hence the books were viewed with some extra reverence
 kitaaben padhane vaale budhimaan maane jate rahe, kitaaben likhane vaale or zyaada vidwaan
 But outside the scope of educational institutions and outside academia activities, the best literature was less read
 ve kitaaben zyada chalin jo rahasy-romaanch, aparaadh or sex bechati raheen
 It is not uncommon that some of the world's most famous writers have been writers of detective novels
 beshak, unamem se kai bahut shreshth lekhak rahe hai, lekin ve un mahanatam lekhakon kii suchi main nahin aate jo kam padhe gaye, lekin jinhone zyaada moolyawaan diya
 Yet books owe us much favor
 sadiyon tak unhone sabhyataaon ko sinchaa he
 Their role is very important in preserving the humanity within us
 hamaari peedi tak aise lakhon nahin, karodon log honge jinhen course kii kitabon se alag baaki kitaaben chup-chup kar, samay nikaal kar padhane kii yaad hogi
 Then we did not celebrate Book Day, did not think of books romantically
 duusari baat yah ki kitaaben padhane ke bare main sochna jitna sundar lagata he, kitaaben padhanaa hameshaa utana sundar kaam nahin hua karata
 He demands a lot of endurance
 usamen dimag par jor lagaana padataa he
 Recreational books are easy to read, but books which demand some depth, which give clues to our contradictions, which give us knowledge, are also boredom at times
 duniya ke kai mahanatam upanyaas pehali shrenee ke pathneey upanyaas nahin hai
 Their readability demands certain conditions
 beshak, ve kam padhi jaaen, lekin ve sadiyon tak tiki rahati hai
 Then books not only teach good things, but also teach many bad things
 kitaaben darasal gyaan kaa strot hai
 That knowledge can be of all kinds
 kitaaben agar aapako manushya bana sakati hai to kabhi-kabhi apni manushyata chhodane par baadhya bhi kar sakati hai
 Through books, we have seen the promotion of communalism and also the lie
 baharhaal, hamaare samay main kitabon ke sankat kuch or hai
 The new mediums have broken the monopoly of books printed on knowledge
 shikshan-sansthaanon main shaayad sadiyon baad aisa ho rahaa he ki kitabon kii ahmiyat kam ho rahi he or computer yaa online adhyayan ke vikalp bad rahe hai
 Of course, they depend on books, but gradually it is showing that the younger generation is less interested in reading, more interested in watching videos
 kitabon kii jagah bhi dhire-dhire i book lete ja rahe hai
 The growing popularity of the Kindle is pointing to this fact
 beshak, kitaaben- or saahitiyik kitaaben bhi- ab tak bahut badi taadaad main chap or bik rahi hai
 It is surprising to see that every day a new plant of poets-storytellers and writers in Hindi is coming with their new books
 darasal hamaari puri sabhyataa main kitabon kii jaden itane gahare dhansi hui hai ki unhen aasaani se nikaalnaa to dur, isaki kalpana bhi nahin kii ja sakati
 There will come a day when we will be part of a bookless society - it is difficult to think at least for our generation
 lekin pustak diwas manaa kar or pustakon ke prati nakli prem jataa kar ham kitabon ko nahin bachaa paaenge
 Books will be saved only when the practice of reading within us remains
 padhane kaa abhyaas tab bachegaa jab hamen apane itihaas-bhugol ko lekar hamaari jigyaasa bachi rahegi
 The importance of the book opens from here
 kitaaben hamaara bauddhik paryaavaran banaati hai
 This environment is necessary for our survival
 kitaab padhie, koob padhie, bas yah na kahie ki kitabon se aapako prem he

 60 lakh se zyada keemat vaali ek audi kyuu 7 car par choron ne haath saaf kiya
 a middle-aged man carries a sack in his hand and in the blink of an eye breaks the side view mirrors of the car and disappears

 Now Sunil has two options to either claim the insurance for the side view mirrors, in which he will have to pay half of the total price i

 aisi kai choriyon or unase jude girohon ko pakad chuke dilli police ke senior inspector rajendra singh kaa kahana he ki dilli main aise kareeb 30 gang hai or inamen kareeb 100 log hai
 On the other hand, DCP MA Rizvi of Crime Branch says that low risk, short time theft and good money, have caused car thieves to make parts of cars such as batteries, evms, stereos and tires disappear instead of car theft
 , But they are the most stolen side view mirror of expensive cars

 bharat ke pradhanmantri ne soochna va prasaaran mantralay ke us faisle ko waapas le liya jiske virodh main mangalvaar subah se patrakaron ke bich halchal thi
 On Monday evening, a press release is issued by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting that if a journalist is found to be involved in creating or spreading fake news, his official recognition will be canceled forever
 news phek he yaa nahin iskaa faisla press council of india or News Broadcasters Association (nba),karegaa
 Is it not strange that the Ministry has defined the punishment for how much punishment will be given, but the right to decide the punishment for which will be given to the NBA and the Press Council of India
 ham yah nahin jaanate hai ki phek news ke liye sazaa tay karte vakt soochna va prasaaran mantralay ke adhikariyon or mantri ke dimag main phek news tay karne kaa paimaana kya tha
 According to which definition, the Ministry came to the decision that the recognition of recognized journalist who print, create or spread fake news will be canceled
 agar jaanch main sahi paaya gaya to pehle patrkaar kii manyata chah maheene ke liye nilambit kii jaaegi
 Then if he is found a second time, the recognition will be suspended for one year and
 teesri baar doshi paaya gaya to hameshaa ke liye uski manyata radd kar di jaaegi
 The Press Council of India and the NBA are expected to complete the investigation in 15 days, but in these 15 days the accredited journalist will be considered suspended
 is faisle ko lekar patrkaar birdari main charchaa hone lagi ki kya sarkaar manyata praapt patrakaron par ankush lagaana chaahati he
 In India, the spread of fake news is widespread, but no one understood that the epidemic of fake news is spread due to the accredited journalists or through the spooky anchors of the dock media
 soochna prasaaran mantralay ne is faisle par pahunchane se pehle kya kisi sanstha se vichaar vimarsh nahin kiya
 Annie Joseph's statement from NBSA has been expressed in the Express that she does not even have information nor opinion is taken from her
 phir yah vichaar kis str par mantralay ke bheetar filon main aata he or faisle main koun-koun log shaamil the, isaki koi jaankaree nahin he
 From morning onwards, journalists started criticizing the government's decision on Twitter
 Swati Chaturvedi? ne likhaa ki Dear @pmoindia bahut se ghamandi netaaon ne media ko kuchalane kaa prayaas kiya
 All failed hairaani ho rahi he ki godi media ke panna pramukhon ke baad bhi asurakshit mahasoos kar rahe hai
 Right there, Malini Parthasarathy? Tweeted that the media is responsible for checking the veracity and credibility of the news
 jo chhapata he uski javabdehi hoti he, manahani or avmaananaa kaa kanoon bhi he
 More control means that the force is being imposed
 Rana Safvi ne twit kiya he ki MJ Akbar bhul gaye hai jab unhone rajeev gandhi ke manahani vidheyak ke khilaaf janpath par march kiya tha
 We told Rajiv that there would be no compromise with the freedom of the press
 ummid he emje akbar ko yaad hoga or ve smriti irani ke aadesh ke khilaaf bhi march karenge
 Sagarika Ghose tweeted that who decides fake news, you or your part? Was India closed yesterday or was it all fake news? Is unemployment fake news? Death during demonetisation is fake news? Pamphlet leaked in exam, is fake news or real news? Shekhar Gupta? Had a tweet that don't make a mistake
 mukhyadhara kii media par yah hamalaa he
 It is as long as Rajiv Gandhi's defamation bill
 sabhi media ko apane antarvirodh ko dur kar iskaa virodh karnaa chahie
 Despite this criticism, Information Broadcasting Minister Smriti Irani remained firm on her decision
 12 bajkar 17 minute par or 12 bajkar 19 minute par smriti irani do twit karti hai or apane faisle kaa bachaav karti hai
 Writes in the first tweet that PIB manyata ke liye jo dishanirdesh jari hui he, usamen kaha gaya he ki press council of india or News Broadcasters Association phek news kii paribhaasha tay karenge or karrwai karenge
 There is a debate about this
 kai patrakaron or sanghathanon ne iske bare main hamase sampark kiya or sakaaratmak suzav die hai
 In the first tweet, she writes that some journalists and organizations have contacted her
 saarvajanik jaankaree main nahin he ki kis patrkaar or sanghathan ne unase sampark kiya or mantralay is nattejey par kaise pahunchaa ki phek news ke liye manyata praapt patrkaar hi doshi hai, isliye sabase pehle unheen par karrwai honi chahie or faisla hota he ki sazaa kya hogi, lekin jurm koi or tay kar legaa
 Anyway when the Minister was defending his decision
 uske thik kuch minute baad 1 baj kar 27 minute par press information beuro kii site par ek doosraa faisla aata he ki phek news se sambandhit press release waapas le lee gai he, jise pichhali shaam aplod kiya gaya tha
 Then, at 2: 33 minutes on the Twitter handle of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, a decision is taken that the press release that was issued to control fake news is withdrawn
 hamane mantri smriti irani kaa twitor handle check kiya he, 12 baj kar 19 minute ke baad press release waapas lene ke sambandh main unka koi twit he yaa nahin
 No tweet in this regard was found on his handle
 unhone amit shah ke twit ko ri-twit to kiya he magar apane hi mantralay ke faisle ko ri-twit nahin kiya he
 We checked at 7
21 am that Smriti Irani did not even thank the Prime Minister for withdrawing the decision, while the NBA also welcomed the Prime Minister's decision, which is also not known that the NBA condemned the decision Did it or not
 press club of india main shaam saadhe chaar baje patrkaar jutane vaale the
 It was earlier told that the decision has been withdrawn on the initiative of the Prime Minister
 iske baad bhi badi sankhya main patrkaar jamaa hue or lagaataar press kii azaadi ke saath ho rahe khilwaad ko lekar apni chintaa jataai
 Just a few days ago, during the rally of JNU Students Union and Teachers Union, journalists gathered here to protest against the violence that came with the cameraman and marched till Parliament
 kisi ko pataa nahin tha ki itani jaldi phir se sarkaar ke kisi faisle ke virodh main jamaa hona padegaa
 Our colleague Amitesh spoke to the journalists who came there
 hamaare sahyogi maanas or nimisha ne ek report kii he
 It has been told that somewhere the government is the root of fake news
 vah bhi is samasya kaa ek kaaran to nahin he
 The news has come that the Prime Minister wants this to be discussed in the Press Council of India
 lekin isi 16 march ko press council of india main kuch badlaav kiya gaya he
 BJP MP from Mysore Pratap Simha has been nominated for this council on behalf of the speaker of the Lok Sabha
 saansad pratap simha kaa twit dekhie
 He defended Mahesh Hegde, who is the editor of Postcard News, by tweeting last week
 jinhen ek jain sant kii maut ke bare main galat news chhapane ke aarope main giraftaar kiya gaya he
 While he died in a road accident
 jo vyakti phek news ke aarope main giraftaar hua he, uskaa bachaav saansad karen or us saansad ko press council of india main manonit kiya jaae, jahaan pradhanmantri chaahate hai ki phek news par bahes ho
 Irony should also be ashamed of this cycle and vicious cycle
 pratap simha hi nahin or bhi kai saansad hai jinhone postcard news ke sampadak kii giraftaar ke samarthan main twit kiya he
 Alt News continues to expose fake news, it has exposed many dangerous fake news of postcard news
 iske baad bhi bijepi ke saansad iske sampadak main twit kar rahe the
 Among those who tweeted were Union Minister Anantkumar Hegde
 dilli se saansad mahesh giri ne bhi mahesh hegade ke samarthan main twit kiya he
 The story does not end there
 teen din pehle modi sarkaar ke kai mantriyon ne phek news kaa bhandaphod karne kaa daawa karne vaali ek website ko pramot karte hai
 Let's tweet her link
 is website kaa naam he The True Picture iske bare main indian express ke krishna kowshik ne bhi shandaar reporting kii he
 The link to this has been tweeted by Smriti Irani herself
 indian express ne jab padtaal kii to paaya ki uski sahi khabaron ko bhi is website main phek news bataa diya gaya he
 Especially after buying a horse, the news of the murder of a Dalit youth was written by the Express after talking to all the sides, but on this website it was told fake news
 indian express ne is website kaa pataa thikaana lagaaya
 It turned out that it has a Bluecraft Digital Foundation phone number
 yah foundensh pradhanmantri kii kitaab Exam Warriors se sambandh rahaa he
 When Kaushik of Express asked him how your number is on this website, he replied that there must have been something wrong
 hamaara koi sambandh nahin he
 But when our colleagues Manas and Nimisha checked after the story of Express, mobile number was found written there
 Truecaller, se pataa chalaa ki yah number kisi amit malviya ke naam par darj he
 We called this number but this number was not present
 hamane bijepi ke iticel ke mukhiya amit malviya se poocha ki kahin aapkaa number to nahin tha, unka jawaab tha ki nahin
 Our colleagues tried to ask all the ministers, no one responded
 tippaniyan Rajasthan will remember the black law, which was opposed by journalists across the country
 vah kanoon kya tha, yahi ki kisi adhikari ke khilaaf aap tak khabar nahin chhap sakate yaa uskaa naam nahin le sakate jab tak sarkaar se anumati na mili yaa exiaar na ho
 If this rule is broken then the journalist will be punished for two years
 iskaa khub virodh hua
 Later the Rajasthan government had to withdraw that ordinance
 iske baad bhi soochna va prasaaran mantralay ne yah kadam kyon uthaaya, kiske kehane par uthaaya samaj ke baahar he
 Tried to bring another such law in Madhya Pradesh, but this time it was for the mlas
 patrika ke sampadak gulab kothaari ne ek or kaala naam se sampadakeey likhaa tha
 The discussion of which could not reach Delhi
 iskaa arth yah hua ki kitna bhi gambhir mudda yadi kisi samiti ke saamne vichaaradhin he to koi vidhayak us mudde par prashn hi nahin puch saktaa he
 It was an attempt to prevent any question from coming to the House under the cover of sensing incident and traditional responsibility
 yah gulab kothaari ne apane sampadakeey main likhaa he jo 21 march ke rajasthan patrika ke sabhi sanskarnon main chapa he
 We are accompanied by Prateek Sinha of Alt News who has been exposing Fake News alone for several months

 When Kaushik of Express asked him how your number is on this website, he replied that there must have been something wrong

 But when our colleagues Manas and Nimisha checked after the story of Express, mobile number was found written there
 Truecaller, se pataa chalaa ki yah number kisi amit malviya ke naam par darj he
 We called this number but this number was not present
 hamane bijepi ke iticel ke mukhiya amit malviya se poocha ki kahin aapkaa number to nahin tha, unka jawaab tha ki nahin
 Our colleagues tried to ask all the ministers, no one responded
 tippaniyan Rajasthan will remember the black law, which was opposed by journalists across the country
 vah kanoon kya tha, yahi ki kisi adhikari ke khilaaf aap tak khabar nahin chhap sakate yaa uskaa naam nahin le sakate jab tak sarkaar se anumati na mili yaa exiaar na ho
 If this rule is broken then the journalist will be punished for two years
 iskaa khub virodh hua
 Later the Rajasthan government had to withdraw that ordinance
 iske baad bhi soochna va prasaaran mantralay ne yah kadam kyon uthaaya, kiske kehane par uthaaya samaj ke baahar he
 Tried to bring another such law in Madhya Pradesh, but this time it was for the mlas
 patrika ke sampadak gulab kothaari ne ek or kaala naam se sampadakeey likhaa tha
 The discussion of which could not reach Delhi
 iskaa arth yah hua ki kitna bhi gambhir mudda yadi kisi samiti ke saamne vichaaradhin he to koi vidhayak us mudde par prashn hi nahin puch saktaa he
 It was an attempt to prevent any question from coming to the House under the cover of sensing incident and traditional responsibility
 yah gulab kothaari ne apane sampadakeey main likhaa he jo 21 march ke rajasthan patrika ke sabhi sanskarnon main chapa he
 We are accompanied by Prateek Sinha of Alt News who has been exposing Fake News alone for several months
 press council of india or enbie se ummid kii jaati he ki ve 15 dinon main jaanch puri kar lenge magar in 15 dinon main manyata praapt patrkaar nilambit hi mana jayega
 There was a discussion in the journalist fraternity about the decision whether the government wanted to curb the accredited journalists
 bharat main phek news kaa ambara failaa hua he, magar yah kisi ko samaj nahin aa rahaa tha ki phek news kii mahamari manyata praapt patrakaron ke kaaran faili hui he yaa godi media ke chatukaar ankaron ke zarie fail rahi he
 Did the Ministry of Information Broadcasting not consult any institution before reaching this decision? enbiese kii ani joseph kaa bayaan chapa he express main ki unhen jaankaree tak nahin or na hi unase raay lee gai he
 Then at what level this idea comes in the files within the Ministry and there is no information about who was involved in the decision
 subah se hi patrkaar twitor par sarkaar ke faisle kii aalochana karne lage
 Swati Chaturvedi? Wrote that Dear @pmoindia Many arrogant leaders tried to crush the media

 Surprisingly, even after the emerald heads of the dock media are feeling insecure
 vahiin, Malini Parthasarathy? ne twit kiya ki news kii satyata or vishwasaneeyata kii jaanch kii zimmedaari media kii he
 What is printed has accountability, there is also a law of defamation and contempt
 isse zyaada niyantran kaa matlab he ki sensharship thopa ja rahaa he
 Rana Safvi has tweeted that MJ Akbar has been forgotten when he marched on Janpath against Rajiv Gandhi's defamation bill
 hamane rajeev se kaha tha ki press kii azaadi se koi samjhauta nahin hoga
 Hopefully MJ Akbar will remember and they will also march against Smriti Irani's order
 Sagarika Ghose ne twit kiya ki phek news koun tay karata he, aap yaa aapaki part? kya bharat band kal hua tha yaa sara kuch phek news tha? kya berojgaare phek news he? notebandi ke dauraan hui maut phek news he? pariksha main parche li hue, phek news he yaa asli news he? Shekhar Gupta? kaa twit tha ki galati mat kiijie
 This is an attack on the mainstream media
 rajeev gandhi ke manahani vidheyak jaisaa lamhaa he ye
 All media should overcome its contradiction and oppose it
 is aalochana ke baad bhi soochna prasaaran mantri smriti irani apane faisle par adi raheen
 Smriti Irani tweets and defends her decision at 12:17 and 12:19
 pehle twit main likhti hai ki The guidelines issued for PIB accreditation states that the Press Council of India and the News Broadcasters Association will define the definition of fake news and take action
 ise lekar bahes ho rahi he
 Many journalists and organizations have contacted us about this and have given positive suggestions
 pehle twit main likhti hai ki kuch patrakaron or sanghathanon ne unase sampark kiya he
 Public information is not known about which journalist and organization contacted them and how the ministry came to the conclusion that only accredited journalists are guilty for fake news, so they should first act and decide what will be the punishment, But someone else will decide the crime
 vaise bhi jab mantri ji apane faisle kaa bachaav kar rahi thi
 a few minutes after that, at 1: 27 minutes, a second decision comes on the Press Information Bureau site that the press release related to Fake News has been withdrawn, which was uploaded the previous evening
 uske baad soochna va prasaaran mantralay ke twitor handle par 2 bajkar 33 minute par yah faisla twit hota he ki phek news ko niyantrit karne ke liye jo dishanirdesh jari kii gai thi, wo press release waapas lee jaati he
 We have checked the Twitter handle of Minister Smriti Irani, whether she has any tweet regarding withdrawal of press release after 12:19 minutes
 unke handle par is sambandh main koi twit nahin mila
 He has retweeted Amit Shah's tweet but has not retweeted his own ministry's decision
 hamane 7 bajkar 21 minute par check kiya ki smriti irani ne faisla waapas lene ke liye pradhanmantri ko dhanyavad tak nahin diya, jabaki enbie ne pradhanmantri ke faisle kaa swaagat bhi kar diya, jiske bare main bhi yah jaankaree nahin he ki enbie ne faisle kii ninda kii thi yaa nahin
 Journalists were about to gather at the Press Club of India at 4:30 pm
 isse pehle bataaya gaya ki pradhanmantri kii pahal par faisla waapas le liya gaya he
 Even after this, a large number of journalists gathered and expressed their concern about the continuous messing up with the freedom of the press
 abhi kuch hi din pehle jeenyu chaatr sangh or shikshak sangh kii raily ke dauraan cameraman ke saath jo hinsa hui thi uske virodh main yahaan patrkaar jamaa hue the or sansad tak march bhi kiya tha
 Nobody knew that it would have to be gathered again in protest against any decision of the government so soon

 That too is not a reason for this problem
 khabar ai he ki pradhanmantri chaahate hai ki press council of india main is par baat ho
 But on March 16, some changes have been made in the Press Council of India
 is council ke liye loksabhaa kii spikar kii taraf se mysore se bijepi ke saansad pratap simha manonit kiye gaye hai

 inhone pichley hafte twit kar mahesh hegade kaa bachaav kiya, jo postcard news ke sampadak hai
 Who has been arrested for printing false news about the death of a Jain saint
 jabaki unki maut sadak durghatana main hui thi
 The person who has been arrested on charges of fake news should be defended by the MP and that MP should be nominated in the Press Council of India, where the Prime Minister wants to debate the fake news
 is chakra or kuchakr se to vidambnaa bhi lajaa jaae
 Not only Pratap Simha, there are many other mps who have tweeted in support of the arrest of the editor of Postcard News
 alt news to lagaataar phek news kaa pardaafash karata rahata he, isane postcard news ke kai khatarnaak phek news kaa bhandaphod kiya he

 uske link ko twit karte hai
 The name of this website is The True Picture, Krishna Kaushik of Indian Express has also done a great reporting about it

 Truecaller revealed that this number was registered in the name of Amit Malviya
 hamane is number par phone kiya magar yah number maujuud nahin tha
 We asked Amit Malviya, the head of the bjp's itcell, whether his number was there, his answer was no
 hamaare sahyogiyon ne saare mantriyon se poochne kaa prayaas kiya, kisi ne jawaab nahin diya
 The comments rajasthan kaa vah kaala kanoon yaad hoga, jiskaa desh bhar ke patrakaron ne virodh kiya tha
 What was that law, that is, you cannot print news against an officer or even take his name unless the permission or FIR is obtained from the government
 agar is niyam ko todaa gaya to patrkaar ko do saal kii sazaa hogi
 There was a lot of opposition to this
 baad main rajasthan sarkaar ko vah adhyadesh waapas lenaa padaa
 Even after this, why the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting took this step, it is beyond the comprehension of whom it was said

 samvedan ghatana or paaramparik daayitv kii aad main sadan main kisi bhi sawaal ko aane se rokane kii koshish thi
 It has been written by Gulab Kothari in his editorial which has appeared in all the editions of Rajasthan Patrika of 21 March
 hamaare saath alt news ke pratik sinha hai jo kai maheenon se akele phek news kaa pardaafash kar rahe hai
 Sagarika Ghose tweeted that who decides fake news, you or your part? Was India closed yesterday or was it all fake news? Is unemployment fake news? Death during demonetisation is fake news? Pamphlet leaked in exam, is fake news or real news? Shekhar Gupta? Had a tweet that don't make a mistake
 mukhyadhara kii media par yah hamalaa he
 It is as long as Rajiv Gandhi's defamation bill
 sabhi media ko apane antarvirodh ko dur kar iskaa virodh karnaa chahie
 Despite this criticism, Information Broadcasting Minister Smriti Irani remained firm on her decision
 12 bajkar 17 minute par or 12 bajkar 19 minute par smriti irani do twit karti hai or apane faisle kaa bachaav karti hai
 Writes in the first tweet that PIB manyata ke liye jo dishanirdesh jari hui he, usamen kaha gaya he ki press council of india or News Broadcasters Association phek news kii paribhaasha tay karenge or karrwai karenge
 There is a debate about this
 kai patrakaron or sanghathanon ne iske bare main hamase sampark kiya or sakaaratmak suzav die hai
 In the first tweet, she writes that some journalists and organizations have contacted her
 saarvajanik jaankaree main nahin he ki kis patrkaar or sanghathan ne unase sampark kiya or mantralay is nattejey par kaise pahunchaa ki phek news ke liye manyata praapt patrkaar hi doshi hai, isliye sabase pehle unheen par karrwai honi chahie or faisla hota he ki sazaa kya hogi, lekin jurm koi or tay kar legaa
 Anyway when the Minister was defending his decision
 uske thik kuch minute baad 1 baj kar 27 minute par press information beuro kii site par ek doosraa faisla aata he ki phek news se sambandhit press release waapas le lee gai he, jise pichhali shaam aplod kiya gaya tha
 Then, at 2: 33 minutes on the Twitter handle of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, a decision is taken that the press release that was issued to control fake news is withdrawn
 hamane mantri smriti irani kaa twitor handle check kiya he, 12 baj kar 19 minute ke baad press release waapas lene ke sambandh main unka koi twit he yaa nahin
 No tweet in this regard was found on his handle
 unhone amit shah ke twit ko ri-twit to kiya he magar apane hi mantralay ke faisle ko ri-twit nahin kiya he
 We checked at 7
21 am that Smriti Irani did not even thank the Prime Minister for withdrawing the decision, while the NBA also welcomed the Prime Minister's decision, which is also not known that the NBA condemned the decision Did it or not
 press club of india main shaam saadhe chaar baje patrkaar jutane vaale the
 It was earlier told that the decision has been withdrawn on the initiative of the Prime Minister
 iske baad bhi badi sankhya main patrkaar jamaa hue or lagaataar press kii azaadi ke saath ho rahe khilwaad ko lekar apni chintaa jataai
 Just a few days ago, during the rally of JNU Students Union and Teachers Union, journalists gathered here to protest against the violence that came with the cameraman and marched till Parliament
 kisi ko pataa nahin tha ki itani jaldi phir se sarkaar ke kisi faisle ke virodh main jamaa hona padegaa
 Our colleague Amitesh spoke to the journalists who came there
 hamaare sahyogi maanas or nimisha ne ek report kii he
 It has been told that somewhere the government is the root of fake news
 vah bhi is samasya kaa ek kaaran to nahin he
 The news has come that the Prime Minister wants this to be discussed in the Press Council of India
 lekin isi 16 march ko press council of india main kuch badlaav kiya gaya he
 BJP MP from Mysore Pratap Simha has been nominated for this council on behalf of the speaker of the Lok Sabha
 saansad pratap simha kaa twit dekhie
 He defended Mahesh Hegde, who is the editor of Postcard News, by tweeting last week
 jinhen ek jain sant kii maut ke bare main galat news chhapane ke aarope main giraftaar kiya gaya he
 While he died in a road accident
 jo vyakti phek news ke aarope main giraftaar hua he, uskaa bachaav saansad karen or us saansad ko press council of india main manonit kiya jaae, jahaan pradhanmantri chaahate hai ki phek news par bahes ho
 Irony should also be ashamed of this cycle and vicious cycle
 pratap simha hi nahin or bhi kai saansad hai jinhone postcard news ke sampadak kii giraftaar ke samarthan main twit kiya he
 Alt News continues to expose fake news, it has exposed many dangerous fake news of postcard news
 iske baad bhi bijepi ke saansad iske sampadak main twit kar rahe the
 Among those who tweeted were Union Minister Anantkumar Hegde
 dilli se saansad mahesh giri ne bhi mahesh hegade ke samarthan main twit kiya he
 The story does not end there
 teen din pehle modi sarkaar ke kai mantriyon ne phek news kaa bhandaphod karne kaa daawa karne vaali ek website ko pramot karte hai
 Let's tweet her link
 is website kaa naam he The True Picture iske bare main indian express ke krishna kowshik ne bhi shandaar reporting kii he
 The link to this has been tweeted by Smriti Irani herself
 indian express ne jab padtaal kii to paaya ki uski sahi khabaron ko bhi is website main phek news bataa diya gaya he
 Especially after buying a horse, the news of the murder of a Dalit youth was written by the Express after talking to all the sides, but on this website it was told fake news
 indian express ne is website kaa pataa thikaana lagaaya
 It turned out that it has a Bluecraft Digital Foundation phone number
 yah foundensh pradhanmantri kii kitaab Exam Warriors se sambandh rahaa he
 When Kaushik of Express asked him how your number is on this website, he replied that there must have been something wrong
 hamaara koi sambandh nahin he
 But when our colleagues Manas and Nimisha checked after the story of Express, mobile number was found written there
 Truecaller, se pataa chalaa ki yah number kisi amit malviya ke naam par darj he
 We called this number but this number was not present
 hamane bijepi ke iticel ke mukhiya amit malviya se poocha ki kahin aapkaa number to nahin tha, unka jawaab tha ki nahin
 Our colleagues tried to ask all the ministers, no one responded
 tippaniyan Rajasthan will remember the black law, which was opposed by journalists across the country
 vah kanoon kya tha, yahi ki kisi adhikari ke khilaaf aap tak khabar nahin chhap sakate yaa uskaa naam nahin le sakate jab tak sarkaar se anumati na mili yaa exiaar na ho
 If this rule is broken then the journalist will be punished for two years
 iskaa khub virodh hua
 Later the Rajasthan government had to withdraw that ordinance
 iske baad bhi soochna va prasaaran mantralay ne yah kadam kyon uthaaya, kiske kehane par uthaaya samaj ke baahar he
 Tried to bring another such law in Madhya Pradesh, but this time it was for the mlas
 patrika ke sampadak gulab kothaari ne ek or kaala naam se sampadakeey likhaa tha
 The discussion of which could not reach Delhi
 iskaa arth yah hua ki kitna bhi gambhir mudda yadi kisi samiti ke saamne vichaaradhin he to koi vidhayak us mudde par prashn hi nahin puch saktaa he
 It was an attempt to prevent any question from coming to the House under the cover of sensing incident and traditional responsibility

 MP from Delhi Mahesh Giri has also tweeted in support of Mahesh Hegde
 kahani yahi khatm nahin hoti he
 Three days ago, several ministers of the Modi government promote a website claiming to have busted fake news
 uske link ko twit karte hai
 The name of this website is The True Picture, Krishna Kaushik of Indian Express has also done a great reporting about it
 iskaa link to khud smriti irani ne twit kiya he
 When the Indian Express investigated, it found that the correct news has also been told in this website
 khaskar ghoda kharidne par dalit yuvak kii hatya kii khabar express ne sabhi pakshon se baat karne ke baad likhi thi, magar is website par use phek news bataa diya tha
 The Indian Express located this website
 pataa chalaa ki is par ek bluecraft digital foundension kaa phone number he
 It is related to the founding Prime Minister's book Exam Warriors
 express ke kowshik ne jab inase poocha ki aapkaa number is website par kaise he to jawaab diya ki kuch gadabadi hui hogi
 We have no relation
 lekin jab express kii story ke baad hamaare sahyogi maanas or nimisha ne check kiya to vahaan par ab mobile number likhaa mila
 Truecaller revealed that this number was registered in the name of Amit Malviya
 hamane is number par phone kiya magar yah number maujuud nahin tha
 We asked Amit Malviya, the head of the bjp's itcell, whether his number was there, his answer was no
 hamaare sahyogiyon ne saare mantriyon se poochne kaa prayaas kiya, kisi ne jawaab nahin diya
 The comments rajasthan kaa vah kaala kanoon yaad hoga, jiskaa desh bhar ke patrakaron ne virodh kiya tha
 What was that law, that is, you cannot print news against an officer or even take his name unless the permission or FIR is obtained from the government
 agar is niyam ko todaa gaya to patrkaar ko do saal kii sazaa hogi
 There was a lot of opposition to this
 baad main rajasthan sarkaar ko vah adhyadesh waapas lenaa padaa
 Even after this, why the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting took this step, it is beyond the comprehension of whom it was said
 madhyapradesh main ek or aisa kanoon laane kaa prayaas kiya magar is baar wo vidhayakon ke liye tha
 The editor of the magazine Gulab Kothari wrote another editorial titled Kala
 jisaki charchaa dilli tak nahin pahunch saki
 This means that no matter how serious a matter is before a committee, no legislator can ask a question on that issue
 samvedan ghatana or paaramparik daayitv kii aad main sadan main kisi bhi sawaal ko aane se rokane kii koshish thi
 It has been written by Gulab Kothari in his editorial which has appeared in all the editions of Rajasthan Patrika of 21 March
 hamaare saath alt news ke pratik sinha hai jo kai maheenon se akele phek news kaa pardaafash kar rahe hai
 In the first tweet, she writes that some journalists and organizations have contacted her
 saarvajanik jaankaree main nahin he ki kis patrkaar or sanghathan ne unase sampark kiya or mantralay is nattejey par kaise pahunchaa ki phek news ke liye manyata praapt patrkaar hi doshi hai, isliye sabase pehle unheen par karrwai honi chahie or faisla hota he ki sazaa kya hogi, lekin jurm koi or tay kar legaa
 Anyway when the Minister was defending his decision
 uske thik kuch minute baad 1 baj kar 27 minute par press information beuro kii site par ek doosraa faisla aata he ki phek news se sambandhit press release waapas le lee gai he, jise pichhali shaam aplod kiya gaya tha
 Then, at 2: 33 minutes on the Twitter handle of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, a decision is taken that the press release that was issued to control fake news is withdrawn
 hamane mantri smriti irani kaa twitor handle check kiya he, 12 baj kar 19 minute ke baad press release waapas lene ke sambandh main unka koi twit he yaa nahin
 No tweet in this regard was found on his handle
 unhone amit shah ke twit ko ri-twit to kiya he magar apane hi mantralay ke faisle ko ri-twit nahin kiya he
 We checked at 7
21 am that Smriti Irani did not even thank the Prime Minister for withdrawing the decision, while the NBA also welcomed the Prime Minister's decision, which is also not known that the NBA condemned the decision Did it or not
 press club of india main shaam saadhe chaar baje patrkaar jutane vaale the
 It was earlier told that the decision has been withdrawn on the initiative of the Prime Minister
 iske baad bhi badi sankhya main patrkaar jamaa hue or lagaataar press kii azaadi ke saath ho rahe khilwaad ko lekar apni chintaa jataai
 Just a few days ago, during the rally of JNU Students Union and Teachers Union, journalists gathered here to protest against the violence that came with the cameraman and marched till Parliament
 kisi ko pataa nahin tha ki itani jaldi phir se sarkaar ke kisi faisle ke virodh main jamaa hona padegaa
 Our colleague Amitesh spoke to the journalists who came there
 hamaare sahyogi maanas or nimisha ne ek report kii he
 It has been told that somewhere the government is the root of fake news
 vah bhi is samasya kaa ek kaaran to nahin he
 The news has come that the Prime Minister wants this to be discussed in the Press Council of India
 lekin isi 16 march ko press council of india main kuch badlaav kiya gaya he
 BJP MP from Mysore Pratap Simha has been nominated for this council on behalf of the speaker of the Lok Sabha
 saansad pratap simha kaa twit dekhie
 He defended Mahesh Hegde, who is the editor of Postcard News, by tweeting last week
 jinhen ek jain sant kii maut ke bare main galat news chhapane ke aarope main giraftaar kiya gaya he
 While he died in a road accident
 jo vyakti phek news ke aarope main giraftaar hua he, uskaa bachaav saansad karen or us saansad ko press council of india main manonit kiya jaae, jahaan pradhanmantri chaahate hai ki phek news par bahes ho
 Irony should also be ashamed of this cycle and vicious cycle
 pratap simha hi nahin or bhi kai saansad hai jinhone postcard news ke sampadak kii giraftaar ke samarthan main twit kiya he
 Alt News continues to expose fake news, it has exposed many dangerous fake news of postcard news
 iske baad bhi bijepi ke saansad iske sampadak main twit kar rahe the
 Among those who tweeted were Union Minister Anantkumar Hegde
 dilli se saansad mahesh giri ne bhi mahesh hegade ke samarthan main twit kiya he
 The story does not end there
 teen din pehle modi sarkaar ke kai mantriyon ne phek news kaa bhandaphod karne kaa daawa karne vaali ek website ko pramot karte hai
 Let's tweet her link
 is website kaa naam he The True Picture iske bare main indian express ke krishna kowshik ne bhi shandaar reporting kii he
 The link to this has been tweeted by Smriti Irani herself
 indian express ne jab padtaal kii to paaya ki uski sahi khabaron ko bhi is website main phek news bataa diya gaya he
 Especially after buying a horse, the news of the murder of a Dalit youth was written by the Express after talking to all the sides, but on this website it was told fake news
 indian express ne is website kaa pataa thikaana lagaaya
 It turned out that it has a Bluecraft Digital Foundation phone number
 yah foundensh pradhanmantri kii kitaab Exam Warriors se sambandh rahaa he
 When Kaushik of Express asked him how your number is on this website, he replied that there must have been something wrong
 hamaara koi sambandh nahin he
 But when our colleagues Manas and Nimisha checked after the story of Express, mobile number was found written there
 Truecaller, se pataa chalaa ki yah number kisi amit malviya ke naam par darj he
 We called this number but this number was not present
 hamane bijepi ke iticel ke mukhiya amit malviya se poocha ki kahin aapkaa number to nahin tha, unka jawaab tha ki nahin
 Our colleagues tried to ask all the ministers, no one responded
 tippaniyan Rajasthan will remember the black law, which was opposed by journalists across the country
 vah kanoon kya tha, yahi ki kisi adhikari ke khilaaf aap tak khabar nahin chhap sakate yaa uskaa naam nahin le sakate jab tak sarkaar se anumati na mili yaa exiaar na ho
 If this rule is broken then the journalist will be punished for two years
 iskaa khub virodh hua
 Later the Rajasthan government had to withdraw that ordinance
 iske baad bhi soochna va prasaaran mantralay ne yah kadam kyon uthaaya, kiske kehane par uthaaya samaj ke baahar he
 Tried to bring another such law in Madhya Pradesh, but this time it was for the mlas

 The discussion of which could not reach Delhi
 iskaa arth yah hua ki kitna bhi gambhir mudda yadi kisi samiti ke saamne vichaaradhin he to koi vidhayak us mudde par prashn hi nahin puch saktaa he
 It was an attempt to prevent any question from coming to the House under the cover of sensing incident and traditional responsibility

 indian express ne jab padtaal kii to paaya ki uski sahi khabaron ko bhi is website main phek news bataa diya gaya he
 Especially after buying a horse, the news of the murder of a Dalit youth was written by the Express after talking to all the sides, but on this website it was told fake news
 indian express ne is website kaa pataa thikaana lagaaya
 It turned out that it has a Bluecraft Digital Foundation phone number
 yah foundensh pradhanmantri kii kitaab Exam Warriors se sambandh rahaa he
 When Kaushik of Express asked him how your number is on this website, he replied that there must have been something wrong
 hamaara koi sambandh nahin he
 But when our colleagues Manas and Nimisha checked after the story of Express, mobile number was found written there
 Truecaller, se pataa chalaa ki yah number kisi amit malviya ke naam par darj he
 We called this number but this number was not present
 hamane bijepi ke iticel ke mukhiya amit malviya se poocha ki kahin aapkaa number to nahin tha, unka jawaab tha ki nahin
 Our colleagues tried to ask all the ministers, no one responded
 tippaniyan Rajasthan will remember the black law, which was opposed by journalists across the country
 vah kanoon kya tha, yahi ki kisi adhikari ke khilaaf aap tak khabar nahin chhap sakate yaa uskaa naam nahin le sakate jab tak sarkaar se anumati na mili yaa exiaar na ho
 If this rule is broken then the journalist will be punished for two years
 iskaa khub virodh hua
 Later the Rajasthan government had to withdraw that ordinance
 iske baad bhi soochna va prasaaran mantralay ne yah kadam kyon uthaaya, kiske kehane par uthaaya samaj ke baahar he
 Tried to bring another such law in Madhya Pradesh, but this time it was for the mlas
 patrika ke sampadak gulab kothaari ne ek or kaala naam se sampadakeey likhaa tha

 It was an attempt to prevent any question from coming to the House under the cover of sensing incident and traditional responsibility

 We asked Amit Malviya, the head of the bjp's itcell, whether his number was there, his answer was no
 hamaare sahyogiyon ne saare mantriyon se poochne kaa prayaas kiya, kisi ne jawaab nahin diya
 The comments rajasthan kaa vah kaala kanoon yaad hoga, jiskaa desh bhar ke patrakaron ne virodh kiya tha
 What was that law, that is, you cannot print news against an officer or even take his name unless the permission or FIR is obtained from the government
 agar is niyam ko todaa gaya to patrkaar ko do saal kii sazaa hogi
 There was a lot of opposition to this
 baad main rajasthan sarkaar ko vah adhyadesh waapas lenaa padaa
 Even after this, why the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting took this step, it is beyond the comprehension of whom it was said
 madhyapradesh main ek or aisa kanoon laane kaa prayaas kiya magar is baar wo vidhayakon ke liye tha

 RK Raghavan, the SIT chief who gave a clean chit to Narendra Modi, says that the report has been prepared on the basis of evidence and his honesty cannot be questioned
 raghavan ne kaha ki unhone apana ferj nibhaayaa he, lekin vah galat bhi ho sakate hai
 In this case, the amicus curiae Raju Ramachandran says that on the basis of the evidence, he has done a separate investigation and will know when the report is public

 supreme court ne pravartan nideshaalay ke aalaa adhikari or kai bade maamalon kii jaanch se jude afasar rajeshwar singh ko jhatka dete hue unke khilaaf kisi tarah kii jaanch yaa koi karrwai naa karne kaa aadesh waapas le liya he
 The court has told the government that if it wants, it can conduct an inquiry against them based on the status report submitted to the court
 iske saath hi singh ko 2ji or airsel mexis deal sahit anya bade maamalon kii jaanch kii jimmedaari jari rakhi jaae yaa nahin is par bhi sarkaar hi faisla kare
 That is, the bench of Justice Arun Mishra and Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul has cleared the investigation of the charge against ED officer Rajeshwar Singh
 court ne apane puraane aadesh main sanshodhan kiyaaresel mexis maamle main patrkaar rajnish kapur kii yachika par sunwaayee karte huecourtne apane puraane aadesh main sanshodhan bhi kiya
 The court said that now the old order is quashed under which any investigation or action against Rajeshwar Singh was stayed
 is maamle main subramanyan swami or rajeshwar singh ne bhi yachika laga rakhi thi
 As soon as the hearing started in the Supreme Court on Wednesday, the government handed over the sealed envelope to the court and said that on the basis of the charge sheet filed against Rajeshwar Singh, this report recorded all the activities of Singh, through which he created undisclosed wealth of crores of rupees and investigation
 To influence, many methods were adopted
 court ne report dekhne ke baad kaha ki is maamle kii gambhirtha kaa andaja lagaaya ja saktaa he, kyonki ye rashtriya suraksha se bhi judaa maamla he
 Now that the charge sheet has been filed in this case, first the order under which Singh was protected
 court ne aadesh sunaate hue kaha ki is maamle main chargeshit daakhil ho chuki he, ab sarkaar ko tay karnaa he ki is afasar ko jaanch kaary me koi bhoomika di jaae yaa nahin
 On the other hand, the Enforcement Directorate has issued a statement advocating Rajeshwar Singh
 idi kaa kahana he ki rajeshwar singh jimmedaar adhikari hai
 He has done tremendous work from time to time
 lekin court ne sunwaayee ke dauraan saaf kaha ki sarkaar kisi bhi afasar ke khilaaf aaropon kii jaanch karne ke liye swatantra he
 No matter how high it is
 kyonki court ko sunwaayee ke dauraan bhi singh ke khilaaf kai baar shikaayatein mili thim
 But now that the government has disclosed it in its report and has kept everything on record, the old order has no meaning
 court kisi bhi surat main kisi gambhir aaropee ko sangrakshan nahin de sakati
 Rajeshwar, who became powerful as soon as he went to the Enforcement Directorate, was sent to the Enforcement Directorate on deputation
 yahaan wo kaaphi taqatvar ho gaye
 One of his brothers is a senior officer in the Income Tax Department and the other in the CBI
 aarope he ki singh unako mili gopneey jaankariyaan apane bhaaiyon se bhi saajha karte the
 Now the government has to decide whether to investigate against Singh or not
 unako 2ji or airsel mexis jaise bade maamalon kii jaanch kaary main di gai jimmedaari aage barkaraar rakhi jaay yaa nahin
 They should be kept in Enforcement Directorate or sent to the original cadre UP Police

 Jai Singh forwarded it to Gyanendra on whatsapp and sent it to the candidates who wanted to buy the paper

 But it was stirred as soon as it reached the mobile of a senior officer of the Special Task Force (STF)

 Antisocial elements are trying to discredit the commission
 "atirikt prashnptr bane jariyapariksha kendron main bheje jane vaale atirikt prashnptr nakal girohon kii karypranali kii mahatvapurn kadi hote hai

 The Special Task Force (STF) investigating the paper leak scandal got a clue from here

 The 'adarsh' Center of Question Paper Leaks: What did the Commission look for in the Adarsh indian School in Lucknow that made it the center of such an important examination?

 is shodh se pataa chalaa ki kam maatra main sharaab, yaa roj ek se teen drink mrityu dar ko ullekhneey taur par kam karti he
 However, the authors of the research believe that the benefits that have been reported before drinking small amounts of alcohol have been exaggerated

 The research results have been published in the online edition of Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research

 This decision was taken in the meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Parliamentary Affairs chaired by the External Affairs Minister Pranab Mukherjee
 sansadeey kaarymantri vylar ravi ne baithak ke baad samvaadadaataaon ko baatcheet main bataaya ki isse pehle sarkaar ne 21 july ko loksabhaa kii apaat baithak bulaai thi
 The meeting was then called because of the withdrawal of support from the government of the Left
 aadhikarik taur par aagaamee satr 21 july ko vishwaas mat ke liye bulaae gaye satr kaa hi vistaar hoga
 Vayalar Ravi said that this would be the second phase of the monsoon session called for confidence vote in July
 yah puche jane par ki kya yah 14veen loksabhaa kaa antim satr hoga unhone kuch bhi kehane se inkaar kar diya
 It is being speculated about the timing of the Lok Sabha session that this time has been fixed in view of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh attending the United Nations General Assembly meeting in September

 The study also says that if a stable government comes, even if it is from the coalition, then the glare of gold may decrease and people can turn to investing in real estate

 a major negligence of Uttar Pradesh Electricity Department has come to light
 darasal, vibhaag (UP Electricity Department) ne ek yuvak ko uske ghar main istemaal kii ja rahi bijli ke liye 23 karod rupee kaa bill dhama diya he
 The special thing is that the Department (UP Electricity Department) has clearly written in its bill that 178 units have been consumed in the youth's house during this period
 yah puraa maamla upi ke kannauj jile kaa he
 The victim Abdul Basit has reported the matter to the department
 abdul basit ne kaha ki mujhe lag rahaa he ki bijli vibhaag (UP Electricity Department) ne mujhe puure uttar pradesh kaa bill thama diya he
 Basit said that even if i continue to give my earnings to the department even at my age, i will not be able to pay these bills till death
 bataa den ki vibhaag ne basit ko 23,67,71,524 rupee kaa bill diya he
 In a special conversation with ANI, Shahdab Ahmed, the engineer of the electricity department, said that we will soon correct this bill and give it to them
 unhone bataaya ki reeding main ai kuch gadabadiyon kii vajah se is tarah ke bill jenerate ho jate hai
 We will check the reading of their house once again and based on that they will be given a new bill
 isse pehle aisa hi ek maamla chhattisgarh se bhi saamne aayaa tha
 Where the electricity department had sent a bill of Rs 75 crore to a wage-earning woman for her one-room house
 sanvvaadadaata ne jab isaki shikaayat chhattisgarh state power distribution company limited ke prabandh nideshak ke pie courian philip se kii thi, to unhone kaha tha ki aisa galati se ho gaya he
 You get me the BP number, i will get it fixed right now
 pie sahab is bill ko to sudhaar lenge, magar bill dekhakar yadi kisi kaa dil baith gaya or jaan chali gai to! kai jagah aisi ghatana ho chuki he
 This was the case of Bhaisma village in Korba district, where Sarita Yadav, a resident, lived and worked hard
 uske ek chote se makaan main do pankhe chalate theore do balb lage the
 But Sarita got shocked when she got one month electricity bill of Rs 75,00,00,000
 sarita ne is maamle kii shikaayat vidyut vibhaag se kii thior bijli bill durust karne kii maang bhi kii thi
 In an interview just after the Uttar Pradesh elections, Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav had indicated that he could join hands with Mayawati in the event of not getting an absolute majority
 lekin chunaav parinaam unki ummiido se bahut alag aa chukaa he or ve ab upi kii satta chhodane kii taiyaari kar rahe honge
 But analyzing the bjp's 'overwhelming majority', a shocking figure comes out
 agar congress, sapa or basapa ko kul mili voton ko jod den to yah bijepi ko mili vot se bahut adhik he
 That means if the BSP was also with the congress-spo alliance, the result would have been much more than today
 sapa-basapa-congress ko 50 fisadi votsham 4 baje tak chunaav ayog kii ore se jari aankadon ke mutabik,bijepi ko upichunaav main sirf 39
 Got 6 percent of the vote
 jabaki bispi ko behad kam siten milane ke baavjood 22 fisadi vot mili hai
 While SP 21
 9 fisadi or congress ko 6
 3 percent people have voted
 haalanki vot bant jane kii vajah se adhikansh siton par jeet bijepi kii hui he
 In such a situation, if the BSP, SP and Congress were with the alliance, then a total of 50 percent of the votes could have been in one place
 bihar main hui thi bijepi kii karaari harabihar main ek-duusare ke behad virdohi rahe lalu yadav or nitish kumaar chunaav ke vakt saath ho gaye the
 In the 2015 Bihar assembly elections, RJD-JDU formed a grand alliance of Congress together
 is vajah se bijepi ko 24 fisadi vot to mili the, lekin siten nahin mil pain thi
 rjd's 18 percent, jdu's 16 percent and Congress's 6 percent vote together got 178 seats
 endie ke paas 58 siten ain thim
 In such a situation, the historical result of UP elections may make Mayawati and Akhilesh realize the 'mistake' of not coming together

 com / fpxg4kkg6a 7 people were burnt in a fire in Shahdara area of delhi
 bataaya ja rahaa ki aag alpiji silendar main licage kii vajah se lagi
 In fact, a family lives in a rented house in Jwalanagar area
 subah ke vakt jab khaanaa banaaya ja rahaa tha usee samay yahaan achaanak aag lag gai
 The fire spread so fast that he also took the cooler near the door
 kamare ke daravaaje par lagi vajah se log baahar nahin nikal sake or 7 log jhulas gaye
 These include four children, two women and one male
 sabhi ghayalon kaa ilaaj jitibi aspataal main karaayaa ja rahaa he
 The situation of some people who were burnt in the fire is still serious
 unhen bern ward main rakhaa gaya he or unki lagaataar nigaraanee kii ja rahi he
 According to the report, neighbors were the first to report the fire
 unhone turant agnishman vibhaag ko soochna di
 As soon as information was received, firefighting department vehicles reached the spot and the fire was controlled
 sthaneey logon kaa kahana he ki vakt par damakal gadiyon ke pahunchane kii vajah se bada nuksaan nahin hua
 The victims said that they could not get out because of the smoke filling the room
 unhone kaha ki silendar se gas kaise li hui is maamle kii jaankaree unhen nahin he
 Householders said that the gas agency has been informed
 police maamle kii jaanch kar rahi he
 Explain that due to the intense heat in Delhi, the incidence of fire has increased

 Do not derive the meaning of this line written in buses, but know that you have your hand in the state and system of the country
 aap kii jeet se aap aasmaan par hai
 When we fall on the surface of reality from Dhamma, we will say that you were not like this
 aam aadmi party ne dilli ke dil main jagah maangi thi, dilli ne use dil de diya
 Now your eyes are on the country
 tej bhi he or tezi bhi
 Keep an eye on their speed because you are seeing the effect of old parties too
 kursi ke liye chunaav ladane vaale kursi par chadhana nahin chaahate
 If you fall from the eyes of the public, the back will break
 kyonki janata par abhi eemaandaaree savaar he
 Aam Aadmi Party is honest, but is Aam Aadmi honest? If the common man were honest, then how many unscrupulous people are leaking from the sky? Everyone knows the reality of paradise but, like Chalab Ghalib, keep your heart entertained! As you work, keep on doing your work
 khate rahane ke liye kuch unako khilaate rahiye! le-de ke nipat jaae to har kaam he acha, na bane baat to phir baat banaate rahiye! kuch isi tip ke eemaandaar hai ham
 We choose people
 phir bhunate hai ki wo bevafa niklaa
 Governments cannot be dishonest if the public is honest
 bhrashtachar sirf lene kaa maamla nahin he, dene kaa bhi he
 He gives you your rights as if he is giving a gift
 roti, rojgaar, naukari main aarakshan
 You vote in return
 jab aapako lene kii aadat lag jaati he to vah ghoose bhi de dete hai
 Laptops, color televisions also joined the election promises
 ye haq nahin hai
 But he gives, you take
 sarkari daftaron main aap dete hai to vah lete hai
 You give because you take what you do not have
 ve lete hai kyonki ve aapke galat ko sahi karte hai
 Then they get used to taking, even correcting
 aapke liye tab tak acha he jab tak aapkaa bhala he
 But this habit is bad
 aap chillaate hai ki bahut andhkaar he, kitna bhrashtachar he
 It has taken a lot of water to flourish, and you have given this manure and water
 aap chahen to ukhaad kar phenk den, par aap ko thodaa sa jugad rakhane kii aadat he
 Will take out the balcony just an inch from your house
 der raat duusare kii med kaat daalenge
 Every man is honest from inside
 ye kathan utana hi satya he, jitna ye ki har aadmi andar se beyimaan hota he
 Every man is as much a character as a chant
 kai log aise hai jinka laalach ke saamne imaan nahin dolata
 Because rites and good education often force them to leave even if they get the opportunity
 yaa yun kahen ki mata-pita or shikshakon ke shadyantr se unhen avasar hi nahin miltaa he galat raah par jane kaa
 No one is a criminal by birth or every person is of criminal character by birth, there is no chance or compulsion
 mere saath padhe-likhe log ejeeniyar-doctor bhi bane, kuch apradhi bhi ban gaye
 Because those who became engineers did not get the opportunity to become criminals
 mere pita ne mujhe vah avasar nahin diya, kyonki kitaaben hi itani pakadaa di
 In that age, when he had a pistol, Sina used to get wider at the waist
 padhate-padhate likhane lage to likhane ke or avasar milane lage
 Man becomes typecast
 jaise netaa tipcast ho gaye hai
 Everyone knows that once they become leaders, there is an opportunity to eat, to feed
 aapke emele yaa empi zaruri nahin ki beyimaan hon par desh ke netaa abhi tipcast hai
 All the leaders are thieves, they also raise the slogan, who got a chance if they got a chance
 aravind kejariwal se eemaandaaree kii shuruyaat nahin hui
 One Gandhi was in the Congress whom we worship
 ek gandhi congress main hai, jinase ham jujhate hai
 There are also those in the BJP who bark at dawn and curse at dusk when darkness sets in
 sab avasar par nirbhar he
 If you give opportunity, people take
 aap jinhen chunate hai unki seva main lag jate hai, phir pachhataate hai ki unhone aapaki seva nahin kii
 Give me an opportunity to serve once
 beyimaan hone kaa nahin, eemaandaar hone kaa mauqaa dijie
 If you miss that opportunity, then please be sure
