 On Monday afternoon, as soon as the wheels of the plane kissed the earth at Pune's Lohgaon Airport, the ground of ten houses locks was ready to break
 ab airport se nikali ek car teji se shahar kii sadakon par farrate bhar rahi thi or iske chand ghanton ke baad jo kuch hua, usne ek saath kai logon ko apana sir pakad kar rone par majaboor kar diya
 One by one, queues of people looted in different police stations of the city
 ye is shahar main banty chor kaa nayaa avatar tha
 According to the police, this person is not a minor thief or a prankster, but a thief who has wandered in different cities of the city and completed a century of theft and this has happened due to his unique way of stealing
 darasal, kisi bhi shahar main silsilewar tareeke se chori kii vaardaaton ko anjaam dene se pehle ye acha-khaasaa homework karata he or ye homework tabhi hota he, jab wo kisi jail main band hota he
 Arriving behind bars, he begins a search for a partner to carry out his new feat and as soon as he finds a partner, he breaks out of prison to target a city
 ek baar chori kaa khaakaa taiyaar hone ke baad wo behad weldresed tareeke se us shahar ke liye udaan bharta he, jo uske agle torget par hota he
 On the other hand, his partner at the new city airport is waiting for his boss with a luxury car
 vahiin duusari ore hawaii jahaaj se munna kisi shahar main utarataa he or uskaa chela use gaadi main bithakar agali chori ko anjaam dene ke liye nikal jaataa he
 Arguably this thief is the new avatar of Bunty Chor
 banty kii tarah hi pune se giraftaar is shaks kii karatuut bhi use police kii nigahon main khaas bana chuki he balki police kii maane to ye munna kuraishi ke kaam karne kaa taur-tarika hi he, jo uskaa naam banty ke naam ke saath joda jane laga he
 In fact, one after the other high-profile piracy incidents, the Pune police had been looking for a hidden face behind it for a long time and meanwhile the police got the news that Munna Qureshi, who broke locks of more than ten big houses in Pune, Govandi, Mumbai Is hiding in the area
 bas, phir kya tha? police ne jaal bichaaya or munna giraft main tha lekin pakade jane ke baad jaise-jaise munna apana munh kholta gaya, hairaani se pulisavaalon kii ankhen badi ho gai
 Munna told the police that he did not only reiki his target well before committing the robbery, but instead of wearing a suit-boot and riding in a luxury car, something reached him on the spot that no one suspected him
 iske aage bhi munna kii modes oprendi duusare tamaam choron se juda thi
 He had a folding cutter that would easily reach anywhere by hiding it in his clothes, but when the cutter opened, the fate of many people changed
 saaf he ki chori kii vaardaaton ko anjaam dene main is munna kaa tarika bhi hubahu banty se mail khaataa he
 He drives on Bunty-like airplanes and luxury vehicles, using technology for theft
 bade gharon ko torget karata he or har baar pakade jane ke baavjood agali baar phir nai saazish ke saath baahar aata he
 Even smiling is presented in front of the media in the same manner as Bunty does, and now his result is also like Bunty once again
 yani is baar wo bhi banty kii tarah bade ghar main yani jail pahunch gaya he
 Ranbir Kapoor has worked hard to look like him in Sanjay Dutt's biopic film
 vajan badhaane se lekar apana hair style tak ranbir ne change kar liya
 Now it has been heard that Ranbir will get tattoo done like Sanju Baba
 khabaron kii maane to apane kairactor kii baarikiyon ko mentin karne ke lierenbirne aisa karne kaa sochaa he
 That is, as many tattoos are on Sanjay Dutt's body, as many tattoos will also be seen on Ranbir's body
 aapako bataa densanjay dutt kii byopicki shooting in dinon puri tarah se chal rahi he jisamen ranbir kapur ke saath-saath viki kaushal, manisha koirala or baaki sitare hai
 Regarding the ongoing legal battle in the Supreme Court on the 2G spectrum allocation case, the government says that there has been a fight between telecom companies
 'atirikt salisitor general indira jaisingh ne nyaayalay main kaha, 'is kshetra kii sevapradaata fermon main ek tarah kaa yuddh chal rahaa he
 Some of them are supporting government policy (2G spectrum) while some are against it
 'nyaayadhish ji es singhvi tathaa nyaayadhish eke ganguli kii khandpeeth is maamle kii sunwaayee kar rahi he
 Jaisingh wanted the court to allow the government to present its arguments after hearing the views of all other parties
 haalanki nyaayalay ne is tark ko yah kehete hue khaarij kar diya ki is maamle main mahatvapurn pahalu niti se judaa he or sarkaar ko apana paksh pehle rakhana chahie taaki is pahalu par uskaa ravaiya spasht ho
 Jaisingh said, "if many companies are in favor of government policy, some will oppose it
 acha ho agar companiyon kaa paksh sunne ke baad sarkaar kaa paksh suna jaae
 The court said, 'all companies benefit from your policy
 isliye, koi bhi aapkaa (sarkaar kaa) virodh nahin karegi
 ' in dinon bollywood main choti filmon ke saath bade naam jodne kaa chalan he
 One such example is Shahid
 hansal mehta kii is film ke saath digni utivi kaa naam jud gaya he

 digni utivi ke managing diarector siddharth roy kapur kehete hai, ‚Äúdigni utivi ko is baat kii khushi he ki vah hansal mehta jaise filmmekars ko badhaava dene main sabase aage he
 We are confident that Hansal's film Shahid will be liked by those who believe in tremendous storytelling
 ‚Äùfilm ke diarector hansal mehta bataate hai, ‚Äúshahid meri team or mere liye ek film se bhi kaaphi zyada he
 The film is the true story of Shahid Azmi and shows his inspirational life
 unki kahani ne mere jivan ko badalakar rakh diya
 This film taught me to never be afraid of anyone and never hold back from standing up for your values
 utivi digni ne film le lee he to is tarah yah film bade darshak varg tak pahunch sakegi or isaki kahani logon ke dilon main prerana kii lau jagayegaa
 The story of Shahid Azmi is the true story of Shahid Azmi, a human rights activist and lawyer who was killed in 2010 by unknown assassins in his own office
 aatankwaadi banane kii koshish se lekar kathor aatankwaadi-nirodhak kanoon ke antargat galat dhang se jail main daale jane or phir maanav adhikaron (khaskar alpsankhyakon ke liye) kaa champion banane tak, shahid ek aise ladke kii preranadai jivan yatra kii padtaal karti he, jo bharat main badhate sampradayik hinsa ko dekhte hue maanav adhikaron ke liye ek aisa maseehaa ban jaataa he, jisaki ummid nahin kii ja sakati thi
 In this film, Raj Kumar Yadav plays Shahid and is accompanied by Prabhleen Sandhu and Baljinder Kaur
 raaj kumaar yadav kehete hai, ‚Äúhar actor ko jivan main aise 3-4 kairactor or filmein milti hai, jinhen vah jivan bhar yaad rakhaa ja saktaa he
 The martyr is one of them
 ‚Äùduniya bhar main rahaa jalawatoronto, dubai or mumbai samet anek film utsavon main shahid kaa pradarshan ho chukaa he jahaan ise vyapak prashansa mili he
 The film won the Silver Gateway Trophy at the 14th Mumbai Film Festival while Hansal Mehta won the Best Director award

 Recently, Shahid had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival 2012 (TIFF 2012) and has the distinction of becoming a major film at the New York Indian Film Festival and the Chicago Film Festival
 sattarudh congress-rakanpa gathjod ko jhatka dete hue bhaajapa ummidavaar bhimrao tapakir ne somvaar ko pune jile kii khadakwasla vidhansabha ke upachunaav main rakanpa pratyaashee hasharda vanajaale ko haraa diya
 Tapkir defeated Harshada, widow of late MNS MLA Ramesh Vanzale by a margin of 3,625 votes
 ramesh ke nidhan ke baad khaali hui is seat par 13 aktubar ko upachunaav hua tha
 Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar played a key role in bringing Harshada to NCP a day before the by-election and this election remained a question of prestige for Pawar
 bhaajapa kii jeet par shivasena pravaktaa or saansad sanjay raut ne kaha, yah na keval congress-rakanpa gathbandhan kii haar he balki ajit pavaar kii bhi paraajay he
 RPI leader Ramdas Athawale said the victory of the BJP candidate was a result of his party's alliance with the Shiv sena-bjp alliance
 ajit pavaar ke saath rakanpa adhyaksh sharad pavaar kii beti tathaa party saansad supriya sule ne bhi nijee taur par hasharda ke chunaav prachaar kii kaman sambhaal rakhi thi
 The BJP strongly raised the issue of alleged stubborn attitude of Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar, who belongs to Pune district
 khadakwasla vidhansabha baraamati loksabhaa ke antargat aati he jahaan se supriya sule saansad hai
 Reacting to the decision, Supriya said that there was a need for an overview from the NCP
 unhone baraamati kii saansad ke taur par rakanpa kii haar kii jimmedaari bhi sweekaari
 BJP MLA from Pune Girish Bapat said that the victory of the Maha coalition will prove to be decisive for future assembly elections in the state as the people have voted against the ruling coalition and the arrogant attitude of Ajit Pawar
 pune se hi shivasena kii netaa neelam gorahe ne is jeet ko arpiai ke saath bane gathbandhan kii pehali jeet qaraar diya
 He said that this is the beginning of the fall of congress-ncp alliance which has been ruling in the state for a decade
 arpiai netaa athavle ne kaha ki tapakir kii jeet dalit voton ke vibhaajan kii congress kii yojana kaa sateek jawaab he
 State BJP President Sudhir Mungantiwar said that this victory signals the winds of political change that will flow in the state
 agast main anna hajaare ke bhrashtachar ke khilaaf andolan ko samarthan dene ke bahaane ek din jharkhand mukti morcha (jhamumo) kii vidhayak or party pramukh shibu sorain kii ba sita sorain ne ghoshnaa kar di thi ki ve bhi anna ke samarthan or jharkhand main vyaapt bhrashtachar ke khilaaf anshan karengi
 He said that his father-in-law has inspired it
 unka saath jhamumo ke ek vidhayak paulush sureen ne diya
 But the truth broke out
 anshan par baithe abhi kuch samay hi gujara tha, sita ne mukhyamantri arjuna munda par aarope lagaaya ki ve pichley ek saal se jharkhand main khaali pade board or nigam ke chairman ke padon par gathbandhan dal ke aise vidhayak, jo mantri nahin ban sake, ko samyojit karne par taalamatol kar rahe hai
 Then what was the matter became public
 tab se hi rajya main dabaav kii raajnneeti garmaayi hui he
 Everything is happening in Jharkhand for about 40 boards and 36 vacant chairman positions of corporations
 apni hi sarkaar ke kaam or uske harek bindu par naakaam ho jane kii ghoshnaa kar jhamumo ke kuch vidhayakon ne sarkaar ko saansat main daal rakhaa tha
 Then the MLA of AJSU also joined them
 vigyaan or praudyogiki mantri chandraprakash choudhary kii aguai main ajasu ke vidhayak-umakant rajak, camel kishor bhagat or ramchandra sahis-vidhansabha satr se chand din pehle tirupati balaji chale gaye
 Although they returned before the session started
 satta ke galiyaaron main yah khabar thi ki ajasu vidhayakon ke ruuthane ko party pramukh or sarkaar ke up-mukhyamantri sudesh mahato kii maun sahmati hasil thi
 On the other hand, a different game is going on in JMM
 party ke varisht netaa simon marandi, nalin sorain or techlal mahato apni hi party ke khilaaf khulkar saamne aa gaye hai
 She is targeted more by Shibu Soren, less her son and Deputy Chief Minister Hemant Soren in the government, while Sita (her husband Durga Soren has passed away) complains that Hemant is deliberately pushing her to political margins
 aise main vibhinn tarah ke bhay ko board or nigamon ke jariye kam karne kii kavayad chal rahi he
 As such, the post of board and corporation is also a condition of political support
 isi evaj main to videsh singh or chamara linda jaise nirdaleey vidhayakon ne munda sarkaar ko samarthan diya
 But by the end of one year of government, both of them joined the growing group of unhappy legislators
 jhamumo ke andruni sutara is mudde par party ke andar ek anaar sau biimaar vaali sthiti bataate hai
 That is why Simon does not directly talk about the board-corporation, he says the matter of development in which the board or corporation comes up
 ve kehete hai, ''pad khaali hai to bhar kyon nahin dete
 They should be filled up soon after which the work of the state is interrupted
 ''sita kahati hai, ''ham log sarkaar main hai, lekin hamaari andekhi ho rahi he
 We are entangled with officers in our region
 pichhali baar board or nigam kaa mudda uthaa tha to kharasaavaan chunaav kaa bahaanaa banaakar taal diya gaya
 Only giving assurances for a year
 sarkaar saaf-saaf bataae ki use kya karnaa he
 The Pollution Control Board has placed an IAS
 '' sarkaar par bevajaah dawaab banane or maheene bhar ke bheetar board or nigam ke gathan kaa ultimatum dene vaale vidhayakon par bhannaae munda ne unhen saaf-saaf bataa diya ki sarkaar kii praathamikta janata he, board or nigam nahin
 However, the government has directed all departments to hand over the list of such posts
 khaas yah he ki adhiktar daavedaar bataa chuke hai unhen koun-sa board yaa nigam chahie
 For example, Sita needs pollution control board or Jharkhand State Mineral Development Corporation
 camel kishor bhagat or chamara linda kii ruchi pradooshan niyantran board main he
 Anyway, the matter is stuck on many levels
 gathbandhan dal ab bhi bantwaare par sahmati nahin bana sake hai
 The strength of coalition parties and outside mlas is 45, of which 12 are ministers and one is the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly
 32 vidhayakon ko board or nigam chahie
 The division is quite complicated
 saare vidhayakon ko samyojit kar bhi liya jaae, jisaki sambhaavna kaaphi kam he, to bhi yah un logon ko naaraaz karne ko kaaphi hoga jo party ko di gai apni seva ke evaj main mewa kii ummid rakhte hai
 In such a situation, only Munda can tell how difficult it is to run a government
 dipti siem manish sisodiya apane vidhansabha kshetra kii jawahar jhuggi basti main siver line kaa udghaatan karne pahunche
 Often slum dwellers were surprised to see the cleanliness in this slum-ridden settlement
 yahaan ke logon kaa kahana he ki netaa aate hai to safai ho jaati he varanaa phone karne par bhi koi gandagi uthaane nahin aata
 Before the MCD elections, large hoardings and banners of all the parties have started appearing in the area
 hairaani kii baat he ki ilaake ke chote netaa party ke bade netaaon ko khush karne ke liye jitna rupaya kharch karte hai utane main ek gali ko to saafe kiya hi ja saktaa he
 Minister for Water Board, Kapil Mishra, also reached the inauguration of the sewer line
 kejariwal sarkaar kaa daawa he ki dilli kii pehali aisi jhuggi jahaan agle ek saal main 4 kilometre lambii siver line bichaai jaaegi
 Surprisingly, the Aam Aadmi Party government which could not do in the last 2 years is being inaugurated just before the municipal elections
 haalanki kaam kii letlatifi ke sawaal par dipti siem manish sisodiya ne bijepi, congress par aarope madhne main deree nahin kii
 Let me tell you that there is a bad situation with dirt in the area

 bagdadi ne kaha he ki kisi bhi dushman ke haathon mar jaao
 But don't die for those girls
 varna jananath nahin milegi
 Baghdadi had to issue these fresh orders because the girls themselves have taken up arms against ISIS in Baghdadi's stronghold itself
 syria or iraq jaise mulkon main iesas ke khilaaf tut pade logon ke sabar kii sabase nai or sabase chaunkaane vaali khabar saamne ai he
 Now, leaving behind the men, the lady fighters themselves have started to challenge ISIS anew
 syria main iesas kaa sabase bada khauf wipijevipije yani kurdish bhashaa main pipal protection unit
 While the YPJ was started to protect the Kurdish as well as ordinary townspeople from the ism's oppression, but ever since the girls in the YPJ have been slaying slrs, lmgs and rocket launchers such as Assassin, believe isis's bloodthirsty and heartless terrorists kitti-pitti also went missing
 jaanate hai kyon? kyonki in ladakiyon kaa khauf maut ke baad bhi iesas ke aatankwaadiyon kaa peechha karata he
 And the reason is that the terrorists believe that if girls are killed at the hands of them, they will not have any luck in heaven
 ladi fiteron se lagata he darbaat ajeeb si lag sakati he
 But ISIS militants who bleed the innocent in the name of establishing Islamic rule around the world believe something similar and that is why if ISIS is scared the most today, it is the lady fighter
 phir chaahe wo syria kii wipije ho yaa phir iraq kii ye kurdish milicia
 The Kurdish militia has taken the same vow in Iraq as the YPJ is doing against ISIS in Syria
 or ye kasam he iesas ko matiamet karne ke liye aakhri saans tak ladate rahanaa
 By the way, ISIS has also killed many people, sometimes by beheading them, sometimes by burning them alive and sometimes by throwing them from the heights, and these include the soldiers fighting against them, but these terrorists of Kurdish Lady Brigade believe these militant lady fighters
 Hate them more than anything else
 or isaki vajah he, vahi jananath main jagah naa milanevaali
 In such a situation, whenever a lady fighter of YPJ or Kurdish militia gets caught in the clutches of these terrorists, then terrorists not only take her life but also rape her by crossing all the limits of cruelty
 maukey kii talash main rahati ladi fiterlekin kehete hai naa ki maidan-e-jang main kudanevaala maut se nahin darataa to kuch isi andaaj main ladi fiter bhi apane tamaam aslhon ke saath-saath apane paas ek khaas khufia aslha or ek adad goli jarur chipa rakhti hai taaki jab darindon ke changul se chhootane kii koi gunjaaish naa bache to isi goli se wo khud apni jaan le kar khud ko aatankwaadiyon ke saath-saath in saare duniyavi jhamelon se bhi azaad kar len
 It is probably due to the fear of terrorists being killed at the hands of the girls that at present, more than 10,000 girls in Iraq and Syria are clashing with ISIS by being part of different Lady Fighter Brigade
 in brigade main kuch fiter to aisi hai ki jinhone akele sau se zyada aatankwaadiyon ko maar daalaa
 The biggest fear of ISIS terrorists, the Lady Brigade, was laid on August 2014 when ISIS made the mistake of looting and ruining the Yazidi community hiding in the hills of Sinjar in Iraq
 yajidi samudaay bana soft targetdansal, agast 2014 main iesas ne jab iraq main pair pasaarne kii shuruyaat kii to unhen vahaan ke alpsankhyakon main gine janevaale yajidi birdari ke log hi sabsesoft torgetlage
 So, these terrorists started to loot and kill the Yazidis selectively, then, fearing the ISIS oppression, the Yazidis turned to the hills of Sinjar to save their lives but ISIS did not leave them there
 yahaan se takreeban 5 hajaar logon ko agava kar liya gaya
 In which there was also a large number of women and children
 ab yajidiyon ke paas do hi raste the yaa to iesas kii baat maan karislam kubul karanaaya phir tadap-tadap kar maranaa
 But the Yazidis did not give up hope and it was here that the Yajidis' confrontation with ISIS began, which continued to grow with each passing day
 chunki aatankwaadiyon ne yajidi mahilaon ko hi sabase zyada tadpaaya tha to yajidi ladakiyon ne hathiyaar uthaane main der nahin kii

 Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan had put his full strength to win the political bet of Madhya Pradesh's Chitrakoot Assembly by-election, but the result was zero
 congress ne bijepi or shivaraj singh chouhan ke armaanon par pani pherate hue is seat par apana kabja barkaraar rakhaa
 This defeat of BJP is no less than a lifeline for Congress, away from power in the state for the last 14 years
 bataa den ki 2018 main madhya pradesh main hone vaale vidhansabha chunaav se thik pehle chitrakoot upachunaav ko shivaraj singh ke litmus test ke taur par dekha ja rahaa tha
 bjp's defeat in this test and the victory of the Congress are considered by the party's supporters as a sign of change in the state
 madhya pradesh mencongress pichley 14 saal se satta kaa vanvaasjhel rahi he
 BJP has been consistently winning from here in the last three assembly elections
 madhya pradesh main thik ek saal baad vidhansabha chunaav hone hai
 The Congress victory in Chitrakoot just before the assembly elections has boosted the spirits of the battered party workers
 congress pravaktaa randeep singh surajevaala ne party kii is jeet ko badlaav kaa ek sanket kaha he or logon kii party main nishtha ke liye dhanyavad jataayaa
 Surjewala tweeted that the wind is changing
 2013 ke vidhansabha chunaav main chitrakoot seat par congress ko 45 hajaar 913 vot mili the, to vahiin bijepi ko 34 hajaar 943 vot mili the
 In this way, Congress defeated BJP by 10 thousand 970 votes
 chitrakoot ke upachunaav main congress ne bijepi ko is baar or bhi bade antar se haraaya he
 Congress candidate Nilansh Chaturvedi got 66 thousand 810 votes while bjp's Shankar Dayal Tripathi got 52 thousand 477 votes
 is tarah congress bijepi se 14333 vot se jiti
 Let us tell you that BJP has made every effort to win the political party of Chitrakoot by-election
 mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ne chitrakoot ke upachunaav ko apni pratishtha se jodakar chal rahe the
 This is the reason why it is being seen as a personal defeat of Shivraj Singh
 unhone chitrakoot seat congress se chhinane ke liye puri takat laga di thi
 The Chief Minister himself stayed in Chitrakoot for 3 days and held more than 60 public meetings
 adivasee prem dikhaane ke liye ek raat kurraa gaanv main ek adivasee ke ghar bhi ruke, lekin kurraa gaanv main bhi bijepi ko congress ke mukaable kaaphi kam vot mili

 yogi ne choti diwali par ayodhya main to ravivaar ko chitrakoot main deepotsav kiya or mandakini kinare mahaarati bhi kii
 UP Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Maurya took many election meetings, but still he could not win Ram's tapasthali
 is haar ko bijepi ke liye ek bada jhatka mana ja rahaa he
 The special thing is that the state BJP president Nandkumar Singh Chauhan and several members of Shivraj's cabinet conceded defeat only after 12 rounds of counting
 pradesh adhyaksh ne kaha ki vah janata kaa aadesh sir-maathe par rakhte hai
 Chitrakoot is an old Congress stronghold
 is haar se koi fark nahi padegaa ham haar kii samiksha karenge
 The question arises that if Chitrakoot was the stronghold of the Congress then why did a dozen ministers camped there from night to day
 congress kii ore se chitrakoot main purv kendriya mantriyon kamalnath or jyotiraditya sindhiya ne morcha sambhala tha
 Apart from this, this seat had become a place of prestige for Leader of Opposition Ajay Singh, so he also gave a lot of time here
 congress ko mili is jeet ne sindhiya kaa raajnneetik kad bhi badha diya he
 The Congress is advancing Scindia in Madhya Pradesh
 
 The danger is still more for the BJP
 bataa den ki shivpuri jile ke kolaras vidhansabha or ashokanagar jile ke mungawali vidhansabha kshetra main upachunaav hone baaki hai
 The by-election is to be held here due to the death of Congress mlas

 ye report neuy agency IANS kii taraf se he
 According to this report, Vodafone Vodafone is running in losses
 haalanki company ne ab tak is khabar ko lekar koi bhi statement jari nahin kiya he
 Significantly, after the arrival of Reliance Jio, Indian telecom companies Idea and Vodafone have merged and now both companies work together
 IANS kii report ke mutabik vodaphone vodaphone apni packing kar chukaa he or kisi bhi samay yahaan se ja saktaa he
 This is due to operational losses and a drop in market capitalization
 company isi vajah se lagaataar ghate main ja rahi he
 It has also been said in this report that Vodafone has lost millions of customers in the recent past
 taaja phinantial quarter main company ko nuksaan hua he
 Stock market values are also steadily decreasing
 june 2019 main company ne 4,067 karod rupee kaa nuksaan hua he jo isi samay 2018 se lagbhag do guna zyada he
 a few days ago a report came that Vodafone Idea is preparing to resort to a lender to deposit the outstanding amount
 haalanki baad main vodaphone ne is report ko khaarij karte hue kaha ki aisa nahin he or company tay samay se bakaayaa chukaa rahi he
 The Supreme Court has asked vodafone-idea to pay Rs 28,309 crore under the AGR Judgment
 report ke mutabik agar sambhav hua to company is court order ke rivyuu ke liye aavedan kar sakati he
 In an IANS report, Kotak Institutional Equities has said, "if the company does not get relief in the outstanding liabilities of Rs 28, 500 crore, then it will be difficult for Vodafone Idea
" janvari 2011 main jab sudini jaipal reddy murali devda kii jagah kendriya petroleum mantri bane the, to unke liye kaam pehle se tay tha-devda ke kaarykaal ke dauraan jo vivaad mantralay se jud gaye the, unase peechha chhudaana
 The biggest controversy was of Reliance Industries' natural gas block called KG-D6 in Krishna Godavari basin in Andhra Pradesh
 reddy ke mantri banane ke kuch maah ke bheetar hi kaig kii ek masauda report main reliance or sarkaar ke bich utpaada saajhedaari samjhaute main dheron aniyamittaaon ke aarope lagaae gaye
 The CAG indicated that Reliance would have artificially increased its cost of exploration ‚Äî called gold plating ‚Äî which would have led to an extraordinary increase of 117 per cent between 2004 and 2006
 iskaa boj sidhe sarkari khajaane or kamai par padaa kyonki sarkaar ke saath reliance ke anubandh main sarkaar ke saath rajasav saz karne se pehle anveshan kii laagat vasule jane kaa praavdhaan shaamil tha
 The CAG also said that between the first to the second phase and the second to the third phase of exploration, the government had given permission to Reliance to keep the areas not explored, as per the contract, only after the completion of each phase, the company Had to be handed over
 reddy ne reliance ko die gaye in laabhon se upji dharna ko durust karne kaa kaam kiya
 He refused to allow Reliance to recover its full costs, the reason behind which was that production was declining
 beete 31 aktubar ko apni press conference main arvind kejariwal ne kaha ki utpaadan main giravat darasal chupake se gas kii jamkhori karne kii reliance kii ranneeti thi taaki vah apni sharten manwaane ke liye sarkaar ko majaboor kar sake
 Reddy also did not approve ril's cost estimates for exploration in new phases
 ariel kaa kahana he ki reddy ke kadam ke kaaran hi utpaadan main giravat ai kyonki bagaiyr manjuuri ke or ilaakon main anveshan karnaa mumkin nahin tha
 The biggest dispute between Reddy and Reliance was the change in gas prices
 sarkaar ne 2010 main ek visheshadhikaar praapt mantrisamooh ke madhyam se gas kii keemat prati unit 4
 42 dollars (237
 80 ru
 ) Was fixed
 ise april 2014 main sanshodhit kiya janaa tha
 Reddy said that it could not be increased as it would increase the prices of electricity and fertilizer produced from KG-D6 gas
 in vivaadon kaa hal bhi nahin hua tha ki 28 aktubar ko reddy ko mantralay se baahar kaa rasta dikhaa diya gaya or unhen vigyaan va praudyogiki mantralay main bhej diya gaya
 Opposition parties and Kejriwal believe that Reddy has been removed from the ministry due to these disputes
 jabaki pradhanmantri or sarkaar kaa najariya he ki mantralay or company ke bich paidaa gatirodh buniyadi dhaancha kshetra ko nuksaan pahunchaa rahaa tha
 It is to be noted that the maximum power shortage in India is more than 10 per cent and gas is very important to run many power plants
 jaahir he sarkaar apane sabase bade gas ke bhandar keji-di6 main utpaadan kii itani badi giravat bardaasht nahin kar sakati kyonki march 2010 se april 2012 ke bich utpaadan aadha rah gaya he
 Apart from this, the current indecisive investors in the oil sector are bidding
 2009 main ai sarkaar kii nai anveshan or licencing niti 8 ke tahat 70 blokon kii vyavcyki nilaamee kii jaani thi, lekin sirf aadhe se kam par hi boli lag pai
 The government can take a lesson from the oil and gas sector dispute
 use arajak niti tantra ko chhod bazaar aadhaarit paardarshee tantra ko apnaanaa chahie
 Only then can she escape allegations of collusion with companies

 The American think tank Brookings Union recently issued a policy research report saying that the US government has recently taken a series of steps to put pressure on China that do not match the US national interests
 saath hi un kadamon se america main silsilewar ranneetik va bhu raajnneetik jokhim paidaa honge
 According to the report, in the 40 years since the establishment of diplomatic relations between the US and China, every US government tried to develop constructive bilateral relations with China
 lekin america kii vartmaan sarkaar ne manamaane dhang se isse inkaar kiya
 It has been said in the report that the US wants to secede from China because the internal affairs of the US are getting serious, and the decision taken by the US government went wrong
 lekin china se alag hone ke baad un samasyaon kaa samaadhaan bhi nahin kiya ja sakegaa
 The report currently refutes the anti-china statements of some US officials, especially the so-called US and China clash of civilizations
 report ke anusaar yah kathan bahut khatarnaak he, jisase na sirf itihaas ke bare main un logon kii kam jaankaree jaahir hui, balki vah puure asia ke liye apmaan bhi he
 Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan of the BJP government of Madhya Pradesh alleged that except for his party in Uttar Pradesh, the governments of the remaining parties have only given scam and corruption to the public

 Except BJP, all other parties have given Uttar Pradesh only scams and corruption

 Film: rangoondirector: Vishal Bhardwajstar Cast: Kangana Runot, Shahid Kapoor and Saif Ali Khanrating: 3 Starwishal Bhardwaj is known for making sorrowful films and also believes in cinematic charisma
 unki filmon kii cinemetography kamaal kii hoti he or zyaadaatar main dark factor maujuud rahata he, prem rahata he or ek teesraa kone bhi rahata he
 Something similar happened in his film Rangoon
 unhone dwitiya vishwa yuddh kii prishthbhumi par ek prem trikon ko parade par utaara
 Some parts of the film are good, though it seems to miss making a strong connection
 film kaa ant aate-aate thakaan hone lagati he
 Everything seems to be melodrama
 kahin-kahin kamjor parsi theatre jaisaa ehsaas bhi hota he
 Rangooni's story is from film artist Kangana Ranot, who is an action queen and she works in Saif Ali Khan's production company
 donon ek-duusare se pyaar karte hai, lekin unke bich prem kii bhavanaaen kam or ehsaan kaa bhav zyada haaavee rahata he
 The second world war is going on and Subhash Chandra Bose's INA is trying to liberate India from the British
 isi bich ek mishan shuru hota he or kangana kii mulaakaat shahid kapur se hoti he
 The seeds of love flourish between the two and then an attempt is made to show the love triangle and patriotism
 'rangoon' ke is gane main he kangana-shahid kaa sabase bold sinis film kii sabase badi kami us intencity kaa nadaarad hona he, jiske liye vishaal bharadwaj ko janaa jaataa he
 The first half runs very lightly and the film seems to be extremely drawn
 paune teen ghante kii film ko dekhte hue shuru main hi is baat kaa ehsaas ho jaataa he ki ant main kya hone vaala he
 When it comes to acting, the film runs on Kangana's shoulders
 puri tarah se focus main vahi hai
 The female characters of Vishal Bhardwaj's films are strong and Kangana also presents the same thing well
 ve jo bhi karti hai, ji-jaan se karti hai
 At the same time, Shahid Kapoor comes and flourishes with Vishal Bhardwaj
 acting ke maamle main unhone kaaphi mehnat kii he or apane role ko shiddat se nibhaayaa he
 Saif Ali Khan also plays the role of a film producer
 film ke sabhi kairactors main diferent shades hai, lekin ve omkara yaa makabool jaise yaadgaar nahin ban paae hai
 The reason seems to be swinging between the film Desh Prem and the love triangle
 vishaal jab film banaate hai, to unase kahani ke maamle main ummiden kuch zyada rahati hai or is maamle main yah film fail hoti dikhi
 Director Vishal derails the film several times in the affair and gives a useless vibe
 film kaa sangeet acha he or gulzaar kii liriks vaaki shandaar hai
 The stanzas made by the British in the film are fun
 film kii kamjor kahani kahin-kahin aakar tang karti he, or yah film kii sehat ke liye acchhee baat bhi nahin he
 In the Sheena Vora murder case, every moment is turning new
 indrani ke purv pati sanjeev khanna or purv driver shyamvar raay ne apana gunaah kabool kar liya he
 Both of them have agreed to help Indrani in setting up Sheena's corpse
 ye bhi kaha he ki shina kaa qatl indrani ne hi kiya tha, lekin indrani khud ko bekasoor bataa rahi he
 The trio appeared in Mumbai's Bandra court on Monday
 iske baad court unki police remand badhaate hue 5 sitambar tak kar di he
 Indrani's husband Peter Mukherjee has distanced himself from the case
 vah kanoonee ladaai main indrani kaa saath nahin denge
 Such a complex maze of relationships, in which every picture is blurred
 daulat, shoharat or bevafaayee kii aisi kahani, jiskaa har panna daagdaar he
 Such a mystery of murder, which is trying to solve it, complicating its lumps
 aaj har nigaah shina ke qaatil kaa naam talash rahi he
 Everyone wants to know the reason behind Sheena's murder
 lekin mushkil ye he ki shina kii daastaan jis kitaab main likhi he
 His last guard is still blank
 qaatil kaa naam nadaarad he
 Who is his killer ye sawaal abhi jawaab kii raah dekh rahaa he
 This story of wealth, fame, deception and hatred standing on the foundation of marriage is not new
 bhartiya aparaadh ke itihaas main isse bhi pehle kai baar rishton ko taar-taar karte hue aisi vaardaat ko anjaam diya ja chukaa he
 Many times their own people have strangled their throats
 kaatil saamne hota he, lekin saboot or gavaahon kii buniyaad par chalane vaali nyaay vyavastha kii kamajoriyon kaa phid uthaakar kaatil aaj bhi aaazaad he

 atakalon kaa bazaar garm ho gaya
 This was such a high profile case of death

 The first post-mortem took the screw
 ames main forencik vibhaag ke head doctor sudhir gupta ne ek iljaam lagaakar sansani failaa di
 He said that he was under pressure to call Sunanda's death normal
 iske baad sunanda kii pehle se mistry ban chuki maut ek badi mistry main tabdeel ho
 Sunanda's husband and fast-paced Congress leader Shashi Tharoor was surrounded by speculation and speculation
 haalanki, tharur ne kai maukon par ye jarur kaha ki wo chaahate hai ki jaanch jaldi puri ho taaki bebuniyaad atakalein tham saken
 The post-mortem report revealed that the death occurred due to sudden and unnatural causes
 is maamle main sabase bada mode aayaa pichley saal oktober main jab sunanda kii maut kii jaanch kar rahi medical team ne khulaasa kiya ki sunanda kii maut jehar dene se hui thi
 The whole matter began to get confused as much as it seemed resolved
 lekin is saal janvari main dilli police ne is maamle ko katl kaa cese qaraar diya or nai exiaar darj kii gai
 Sunanda's death remains an enigma even after almost a year and a half has passed

 More than a year has passed, but till now this secret has not been able to lift the curtain, how did Jiya go silent? Did Jiah really become disenchanted with life due to the depression in love and not getting work and she either gave her life or was murdered by someone else
 bataate hai ki jiya ko lag rahaa tha ki uskaa boyfriend suraj uski andekhi kar rahaa he
 Jia sends Suraj two sms and asks why he is ignoring her
 suraj ne jawaab main kaha ki wo biji he
 Sooraj called in the evening, Jia told that she wanted to tell him the good news that she had got three films
 suraj ne badhai di or uske yahaan phulon kaa guladasta bheja
 The quarrel increased in the night
 jiya ko ye shaq hua ki usase jhooth bolkar suraj kisi or ladki se milane ja rahaa he
 He threw Suraj's bouquet out of the window

 sindhu nadi sandhi aadhunik vishwa ke itihaas kaa sabase udaar jal bantwaaraa he
 Pakistan 80 under this
 52 fisadi pani yani 167
 2 billion cubic meters of water is given annually
 nadi kii upree dhara ke bantwaare main udaartaa kii aisi misaal duniya kii kisi or sandhi main nahin milegi
 In fact, under the Indus Agreement, a line dividing the north and the south has been fixed, under which the three rivers coming into the Indus region have been given as an offering to the whole of Pakistan and the sovereignty of India is to the south
 The remaining part of the rivers is limited
 1960 main kii gai yah sandhi duniya kii kisi bhi jal sandhi ke mukaable zyada dikkatein paidaa karti he
 The roots of these problems originate from Pakistan
 bharat par lagaai gai silsilewar bandishon ke chalate in teenon nadiyon ke seemaa paar pravaah kii maatra or vaktpar bharat kaa koi niyantran nahin he
 The maximum water from Chenab and Jhelum goes beyond it and the third stream itself is the mainstream of the Indus
 yah sandhi vastav main duniya kii iklauti antaradeshy jal sandhi he, jisamen simit samprabhutaa kaa siddhant lagu hota he or jiske tahat nadi kii upree dhara vaala desh nichali dhara vaale desh ke liye apane hiton kii andekhi karata he
 Despite benefiting from such an unmatched water treaty, Pakistan has responded to India's generosity by carrying out terrorist incidents in the region
 mumkin tha ki nehru ke daur main ek nishchit kaal tak ke liye kii gai is sandhi ko aane vaali peedhishaan ek bhul maanakar use sudhaarney kii koshish karatin
 But till date no government has tried to relate the issue of terrorism with water sharing
 yahi sawaal haalanki pakistani generalon ke dimag main bhi hona chahie
 As Lady Macbeth in Shakespeare's play Macbeth says, "will the ocean of Neptune wash away the blood stains on my hand?" It is unfortunate for India that India's limited sovereignty over the upper reaches of the river already It will be further narrowed after the recent decision in the context of the Kishanganga project
 is sandhi ke tahat bharat ko sirf ran-of-river plant (aise plant, jinase pani kaa pravaah na ruke) hi banane kii chhot he
 These will be plants in which only river current, speed and natural fluctuations will be used without creating any reservoir
 simit jal bhandaaran ke chalate aisi pariyojnaon main mausami pravaah kaa asar hota he or bijli kaa utpaadan prabhavit hota he
 These projects prove to be costlier than large water storage projects
 yah faisla sandhi kii sankeern vyakhya karne kii pakistan kii koshishon kii hi nai kadi he
 This is the new success of Pakistan in reducing India's rights and making the Indus Water Treaty more infuriating
 kishanganga ke maamle main diya gaya faisla adhiplav maarg (spilve) kii sanrachana par bandishen lagaataa he
 This may affect the commercial utility of projects built using river currents
 jaisaa ki assi ke dashak main bharat kii salaal pariyojna ke saath hua tha, jab pakistan ke dabaav main uski dizin main kuch badlaav kiye gaye the
 This international decision, by prohibiting silt control through the rapid flow of water, has mocked the general international standard of spillway construction
 maamle se jude sabhi pakshon se karodon dollar kii fees or oonchi keemten lene vaale madhyasthon or adhivaktaaon ke saath milakar kii jane vaali antarrashtriya madhyasthata akasar nunatam saajha hiton ke aadhaar par kaam karti he
 In the Kishanganga case, the panel has given a decision in favor of Pakistan on the design issue while upholding the legal provisions of the Indian project
 donon partiyon ko or zyada chusane ke liye madhyasth puri karrwai ko 2010 se is saal ke aakhir tak dhakel chuke he or ab unhen 'ummid‚Äô he ki ve ek or masale par apana 'aakhri faisla‚Äô denge
 The decision is how much water India has to release from Kishanganga to Pakistan
 pakistan kii manshaa saaf he: jammu-kashmir main bijli kii kami ke chalate vahaan ke logon main jo asantosh bad rahaa he, use hal karne ke liye bharat ne der se hi sahi, lekin jo pariyojnaayen shuru kii hai, pakistan kaa uddeshy un par aapatti uthaakar unamem adnga daalana he
 The aim is that whatever limited benefits India can get under the treaty, they should not get it
 yah ranneeti darasal pakistani fouj kii tay kii hui he, jiskaa uddeshy ghati main asantosh or hinsa kaa maahaul banaae rakhana he
 Going beyond the provisions of the Indus Agreement on an important issue, the arbitrators have inadvertently given Pakistan a tool from which it can question Indian projects
 is masale par ranneetik kami ke chalate bharat ke liye jo kadava nateeja niklaa he, uskaa dosha khud bharat sarkaar par he
 He made the treaty according to the recommendation of the chief negotiator and made no long-term assessment
 bharat ko ab bhi sandhi main die gaye kuch adhikaron kaa istemaal karnaa he (masalan bhandaaran se jude adhikaar)
 Despite this, it allowed Pakistan to take the issue of the growing gap between the demand and supply of water in the Indus Valley internationally

 The people of the village avoid coming out of our house, because they consider us to be cursed and they will bear this curse

 Jitaram said, 'we do not want to cause any inconvenience to our villagers

 ' Prime Minister Narendra Modi is again on his home visit to Gujarat
 pichley 10 maheene main ye 11veen baar he jab modi gujarat ke daure par gaye hai
 Elections are to be held in the state later this year and there is speculation that elections may be held there ahead of time
 aise main modi ke baar-baar gujarat daure ko party kii chunavi taiyaariyon se jodakar bhi dekha ja rahaa he kyonki gandhinagar kii satta uske liye pratishtha kaa sawaal bhi he or modi jis 'congress mukt' bharat kii baat karte hai, bijepi ne sahi myne main uski shuruyaat gujarat se hi kii thi
 For the BJP, which has been ruling Gujarat for the last two decades and its most successful Chief Minister in the state, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be the watch for the assembly elections in the state
 gujarat main pichley teen chunaavon kii baat karen to tatkaaleen mukhyamantri narendra modi ke netritv main bijepi ko ekatarfa jeet mili or vipakshi congress ko uske mukaable takreeban aadhi siton se hi santosh karnaa padaa lekin is baar party ke liye raah aasaan nahin maani ja rahi or isaki vajahen bhi hai
 Lack of charismatic leadership like Modi, when the BJP comes to the polls in late 2017, it will be the biggest drawback of its commander Narendra Modi for the last one and a half decades
 modi ke rajya kii siyasat se centre main chale jane kii keemat rajya main party or sarkaar pichley teen saal se chukaa rahi he
 The special thing is that after PM Narendra Modi, Amit Shah has also moved to Delhi, Gujarat BJP has no such charismatic face that can take the party and government forward with that status
 iske alaava modi ne rajya main jo badi lakeer khinchi he uski tulana main bhi baaki netaa boune najar aa rahe hai, phir chaahe wo anandi ben patel hon yaa phir unki jagah mukhyamantri banaae gaye vijay rupani
 Anandi Ben Patel was made the new Chief Minister of Gujarat after the fierce Lok Sabha elections of 2014 and Narendra Modi became CM, but Patel could not live with much pleasure in this chair and during his tenure unprecedented movement of Patidars demanding reservation started
 is andolan ke netaa banakar ubhare yuva hardik patel
 In July, Hardik Patel, who was turning 24, launched a movement in late 2015 that Anandi Ben Patel's government was shaken
 haalanki andolan ke hinsak rup le lene se hardik ko jail kii hawa khaani padi lekin is andolan ne bijepi sarkaar or rajya ke patelon ko aamane-saamne laa khadaa kiya
 Significantly, the Patels constitute about 20 percent of the population in the state
 itane bade varg kii naaraazgi ne bijepi ke liye khatre kii ghanti baja di
 As a result, Anandi Ben Patel lost her chair
 daliton kaa andolanpatelon ke ugr andolan ko bijepi ne jaise-taise mand karne main safalataa pai to 11 july 2016 ko oona main daliton ke saath gorakshakon kii marpet kii aisi tasviren saamne ain jisane deshbhar main daliton ko gusse main bhar diya
 In protest against this incident, the Dalits of Gujarat opened a front against the government
 is virodh ko rajya kii vipakshi partiyon or bijepi virodhiyon kaa bharpoor saath mila
 On 15 August last year, there was a historic protest in Una in which not only the Dalits but also the Muslims unitedly shouted against the government
 is virodh pradarshan main guunje jai bhim ke naaron ne gujarat bijepi kii neend uda di he
 These demonstrations took place especially when the BJP and RSS were trying to connect Dalits all over the country
 do dashakon kaa anti inckbansibijepi do dashakon se gujarat kii satta par kabiz he
 The Congress has lagged far behind that and is desperate for a comeback
 ab tak narendra modi jaise kaddavar chehre ke saamne congress kaa har daanv bekaar hi sabit hua he lekin is baar chunaav main modi uske saamne nahin honge
 At the same time, the pawns are expected to get along with the Patels, Dalits and minorities
 aise main congress ke paas apane rivival kaa ye behtareen mauka he
 The way the opposition parties are preparing to unite against the BJP at this time, it is more than likely that such small parties which till now have been proving to be a vote cutter for the Congress, will take the field with it this time
 isse rajya main bijepi ke sameekaran bighad sakate hai
 This is the reason that the party is trying to make the atmosphere in its favor by making Narendra Modi visit the state again and again

 endie ke raashtrapati pad ke ummidavaar ramnath kovind ko samarthan nahin karne vaali vipakshi partiyon par bijepi ke saansad manoj tiwari ne nishaanaa saadhaa he
 Tiwari has said that not supporting Kovind shows that people show off only by talking about the interest of Dalits
 tiwari ne aam aadmi party or arvind kejariwal par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki agar unhen ramnath kovind jaise dalit pasand nahin hai to phir unka dalit prem sirf dikhaave ke liye he
 Because they talk about Dalits, claiming to protect their interests, they do not know Bangalore and where they reach without calling, without even knowing
 wo vemula maamle main bhi vahaan chale gaye the, jabaki koi lenaa-dena nahin tha
 Tiwari also took a dig at Kejriwal and his party and said that he has 67 mlas, hence he has to vote in the presidential election
 ye to tay he, lekin agar unase na paksh, na vipaksh baat kar rahaa he, to unako samaj lenaa chahie ki wo kisi raajnneeti kar rahe hai ki unki koi puch parakh hi nahin bachi he
 According to Tiwari, Ramnath Kovind is a Dalit scholar whose childhood was spent in poverty
 unki gaanv main ghaas kii tapari hua karti thi, jisamen aag lag gai thi or unki maa kii usamen maut ho gai thi
 But Kovind ji made himself capable of being a great lawyer, an MP and now ABJP has made a Dalit scholar like him a candidate for the highest post in the country
 aise main koi unka virodh karata he yaa unki ummidavaari kaa samarthan nahin karata he to unke dalit prem ko aap kya kahenge
 Although she said that opposition parties may have their own thinking, but a Dalit is going to occupy the highest post of the country, she is expressing her own opinion by not supporting it

 It has been 11 days since the state of Delhi witnessed a dangerous air pollution situation, but no significant change has been seen in this situation
 11 din tak jis tarah kaa vaayu pradooshan dilli vaale dekh rahe hai itani lambii avadhi tak vaisaa vaayu pradooshan rajdhani ke ab tak ke itihaas main kabhi bhi nahin dekha gaya he
 Weather has a major hand in taking this unprecedented air pollution to such a dangerous level
 uttar pashchim bharat main monsoon ke baad aktubar ke duusare pakhwaade se koi bhi taqatvar western disterbence nahin dekha gaya he
 Due to this, the weather conditions in north-west India have remained stable and along with this, the smoke rising from the fields of Punjab has spread over a large area of north India including Delhi and not stopped
 darasal dilli ensiaar menvaayu pradooshankhatarnaak level par 28 aktubar ko pahunch gaya tha
 At this time, the smoke of burnt paddy fields in Punjab had reached the capital
 jahaan ek taraf kheton se dhuna uthakar baari maatra main rajdhani ke aasmaan par pahunch rahaa tha to vahiin duusari taraf uttar-pashchim bharat main hawaaon kii raftaar tham chuki thi or isi ke saath taapmaana main giravat kaa daur shuru ho chukaa tha
 Due to the temperature coming down, the density of air on the ground was increasing and at the same time the mixing height of air pollution also came down to 500 meters
 mixing hit wo oonchai hoti he jisapar jaakar dhuna or duusari pradooshak gaisen vayumandal kii gaison ke saath mix hokar bikhar jaataa he
 Mixing height 1 in summer
 5 kilometre se lekar 2 kilometre tak pahunch jaati he
 But after the monsoon, around Diwali, this mixing height falls below 500 meters
 thami hui hawa or ghati hui mixing hit ke chalate punjab ke kheton kaa dhuna vaataavaran main tair rahaa tha or aise main diwaali main hui aatishbaajee ne sthiti ko or gambhir bana diya
 Along with this, lakhs of vehicles plying in the capital Delhi and the smoke emanating from the genset also gathered in the atmosphere of the capital
 in sthitiyon ke chalate deepawali kii raat tak dilli gas chembar main tabdeel ho chuki thi
 According to meteorologists, after Diwali, every year smoke puffs hover over the capital, but it used to be very less in two to three days
 lekin is baar jo hua usamen mausam ko hi villen kaha ja saktaa he
 Actually since the time of Deepawali, there was little movement in the winds over the capital
 uske baad dilli or aasapaas ke ilaakon main hawaaen upar se neeche kii ore baithne lagi
 This condition is called anti cyclonic condition in the language of meteorology
 aisi sthiti main hawaaen sthir ho gayi or dilli or aasapaas ke ilaakon main aatishbaajee or vaahanon kaa dhuna yaheen par tairne laga
 With this, two weak western disturbances also came in northwest India, but they passed through Ladakh
 inase dilli kii hawaaon main nami to bad gai lekin hawaaon ne raftaar nahin pakadi
 On the other hand, the temperature started to drop as the weak western disturbance and the mercury came around 14 degrees Celsius
 issevataavaranamen koharaa banane laga jo pehle se hi maujuud dhune or pradooshan ke saath milakar or ghanaa hokar smog ban gaya
 According to the Meteorological Department, the anti-cyclonic system built over the capital Delhi has weakened but it is not completely finished yet
 agle 24 se 48 ghanton tak uttar pashchim bharat main ek kilometre kii oonchai par tej hawaaon kaa dabadabaa rahegaa or isse thodi raahat milane kii sambhaavna to banati he lekin isse smog puri tarah abhi philhal khatm hone nahin ja rahaa he

 Kareena Kapoor is excited these days about her new film 'bajrangi Bhaijaan'
 is film main unke hero salmaan khan hai or film ke nirdeshak kabir khan hai
 Kareena says that 'bajrangi Bhaijaan' is a film whose story is attractive
 darasal, in dinon karina chun-chunakar filmein kar rahi hai
 In particular, his focus is only on doing films with big budget big actors
 aise main zaahir he ki karina ek aisi film kaa hissaa bani hai, jisamen na sirf salmaan khan hero hai, balki nirdeshak kabir khan hai, jinhone ab tak apni sabhi filmon main katrina caff ko cast kiya
 Then whether it is 'new York' or 'ek Tha Tiger'
 in sabhi filmon main kabir kii heroin katrina caff thim
 Kareena's entry is for the first time, because the enthusiasm in Kabir's film is justified and that is probably the reason why Kareena considers her film very special
 vaise bhi karina thode experiment karke dekh chuki hai or jab bhi kisi film kaa bhaar unke naam or staradam ke kandhe par aayaa us film kii naiya dagamagane lagi
 He was accompanied by his junior Imran Khan in the film 'gori Tere Pyaar Mein'
 film kaa boj karina ke staradam par tikaa tha magar film buree tarah flop hui
 The burden of the film 'heroine' was also on his shoulders and his eyes also did not cross properly
 aise main karina ke liye bhi aisi hi filmon se utsahit hona behatar he, jahaan inke saath salmaan, shahrukh, aamir, ajay devgan jaise bade sitare hon

 nitish kii daleel he ki 7, circular road kaa bangala unhen purv mukhyamantri ke taur par aavantit kiya gaya tha or anya rajyon kii tarah agar koi purv mukhyamantri phir mukhyamantri ban jaataa he to use purv mukhyamantri ke taur par aavantit bangala vaise hi uske naam par aavantit rahata he
 Meanwhile, last week, it was reported that Nitish has been allotted by the government of Bangladesh, a bungalow in Delhi
 yah bangala he 6K, kamraj len main
 Nitish says that he has not been allotted this bungalow privately but as the Chief Minister of Bihar and the Government of Bihar, in which there is nothing wrong
 nitish ne yah bhi daleel di ki purv main kai rajyon ke mukhyamantriyon ko dilli main bangala aavantit kiye gaye hai
 According to sources, since JDU leader Sharad Yadav was rebel, Nitish Kumar was looking for a separate hideout in Delhi where he could hold a party meeting and meeting after which he was allotted a bungalow at Six 6K, Kamaraj Lane
 dilli main bangala aavantit hona nitish kumaar ke centre sarkaar se behatar rishte ke rup main bhi dekha ja rahaa he or is baat kii bhi charchaa he ki nitish kumaar waapas rashtriya raajnneeti main aa jaae magar nitish in sabhi atakalon ko khaarij karte hai
 In such a situation, RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav has attacked Nitish Kumar and said that Nitish's family is very small with only one son, then why does Nitish Kumar need three bungalows? Taking a dig at Nitish, Tejashwi Yadav also says that he could not get the status of a special state to Bihar but has allotted a special bungalow for himself
 magar bangala politics ke hamaam main sabhi nange hai
 As Deputy Chief Minister, Tejashwi Yadav was allotted a bungalow at 5, Desharatna Marg
 argedy ke haath se satta chali gai to nai sarkaar ne tejasvi ko yah bangala khaali karne kaa farmaan suna diya
 The Bihar government allotted Tejashwi a bungalow at 1, Polo Road, which currently houses Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Modi
 sarkaar ne tejasvi kaa bangala upmukhyamantri ke taur par susheel modi kaa aavantit kar diya magar 7 maheene biit jane ke baad bhi tejasvi ne apana bangala khaali nahin kiya he
 Former RJD ministers have to vacate their bungalow so that they have put a writ petition in the Patna High Court on which the hearing is going on
 maamla court main lataka hua he isliye bihar sarkaar bhi tejasvi or anya argedy ke purv mantriyon ko bangala khaali karwaane main philhal asamarth dikh rahi he
 The government is waiting that the High Court will take a decision on this matter only after that it will take action

 Sanjay Paswan, the national president of the party's Scheduled Caste Front, says, "we have no hesitation in admitting that the Dalit community has lost us in the past
" 2014 main yah samudaay hamase majbootee se judaa lekin kuch galatiyon or vipakshi dalon ke bargalane kii vajah se yah samudaay hamase dur hua he
 Well, we are building trust in them and this section will be reunited with us till the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 ''philhal bhaajapa ne gram swaraj abhiyaan kaa sahaara liya
 In this campaign, which lasted from 14 April to 5 May, the ministers and leaders of the BJP government reached the remote village to find the pulse of the Dalits, put a chaupal in the night, but the exercise of eating food with Dalits at the homes of Dalits gave rise to controversies
 aligarh ke prabharee mantri suresh rana 30 april ko khayr ke gaanv lohagarh main raat guzaar rahe the
 In the panchayat house here, the caterer made food which was taken to the house of the village's Dalit Satish Jatav and eaten
 suresh rana kehete hai, ''bhojan daliton ne hi taiyaar kiya tha jise ham logon ne khaaya tha
 '' Dalit thinker and retirement IPS officer
 aar
 Darapuri calls this whole exercise a political gimmick
 ve kehete hai, ''chunaav aate hi kai partiyon ke netaa daliton ke ghar bhojan karne pahunchane lagate hai
 This indicates that the Dalits are untouchable, yet the leaders are eating their homes
 isse na to daliton kaa utthan hota he or na hi unka saamaajik shashaktikaran hota he
 It is evident that before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, a tough challenge has been faced by the Bharatiya Janata Party government of the state to address the Dalit voters
 gorakhpur or phulpur main hue loksabhaa upachunaav main jis tarah se basapa ne apane kor dalit matadaataaon kaa vot sapa ummidavaar ko dilaakar bhaajapa ko chit kiya, usase bhagava kheme ke maathe par lakeeren bad gai hai
 The schemes run by Dalits at the center during the last one year (see box) have also come to the test on the strength of which the BJP has replicated the 2014 Lok Sabha elections and 2017 assembly elections in the reserved seats in the next Lok Sabha elections
 Tanabana is woven
 party ke bheetar asantoshpichley saal march main baari bahumat ke saath satta main ai bhaajapa ne kanshiram smriti upavan main shapath grahan samaaroh kar daliton ke prati apni pratibdghta jataane kii koshish kii
 But within a year, there was a large gathering of Dalits on this ground on 1 April
 nishane par bhaajapa sarkaar thi or virodh main baharich se bhaajapa saansad savitribai phule hunkaar bhar rahi thim
 In the 'reservation Rescue Rally', Phule opened a front against his own government
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki nijeekaran ke bahaane sarkaar aarakshan ko khatm karne kaa prayaas kar rahi he
 He has since consistently targeted the BJP government
 itawa se bhaajapa ke dalit saansad ashok dohare kaa aarope he ki essi-asti act par supreme court ke faisle kii aad main daliton kaa utpeeda kiya ja rahaa he
 Chhota Lal Kharwar, Member of Parliament from Rabtarganj, Yashwant Singh, Member of Parliament from Nagina has also pointed fingers at the functioning of the BJP Government
 2014 main upi kii sabhi surakshit loksabhaa siton par mili jeet or 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav main 80 fisadi se adhik surakshit siten jeetne vaali bhaajapa ko apane hi dalit saansadon ke virodh kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 Many Dalit mps are expected to cut their ticket in 2019, hence they are trying to make a way to get closer to the SP and BSP by being vocal against the BJP government
 prabhavi dalit netaaon kaa abhaavbhaajapa abhi tak upi main koi aisa dalit netaa taiyaar nahin kar pai he jo puure pradesh main prabhaav rakhata ho
 The Dalit MP from Shahjahanpur, Krishna Raj Modi of the Pasi caste is in the cabinet but has not been able to make a mark, the bjp's Dalit MP from Agra Ramshankar Katheria, Mohanlalganj MP Kaushal Kishore have not been identified as the Dalit face of the BJP
 bhaajapa ne daliton ko sandesh dene ke liye hi pichley dinon kanta kardam ko rajyasabha or vidyasagar sonkar ko vidhaan parishad bheja lekin ve rashtriya yaa pradesh str par apni pahchaan nahin bana sake hai
 Former Professor of Department of Political Science at Allahabad University, Dr
 shivashankar kehete hai, ''narendra modi, amit shah or yogi adityanath bhaajapa kii dalit raajnneeti kaa netritv kar rahe hai
 The party does not have a face with which Dalits can connect emotionally
 basapa adhyaksh mayawati ke saamne bhaajapa kii yahi sabase badi dikkat he
 The Jatav fraternity (see graphics), which has a good hold of the BSP, accounts for a little more than half of the total Dalit population in UP
 isse nibatane ke liye bhaajapa kaa gaiyr jatav daliton par focus he
 The BJP has prepared a report of settlements of non-jatav Dalit castes like Pasi, Dhobi, Kori in every district
 in bastiyon main unheen jati ke dalit netaa kai dinon tak lagaataar camp karke na keval logon kii shikaayatein sunenge balki sarkaar main pairvi kar unka niraakaran bhi karaayenge
 Since the formation of the BJP government in the state, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has been trying to convey the message to the Dalits by providing government facilities to the people of Musahar and Vantangiya caste living in anonymity and severe absence
 purvanchal main gorakhpur, maharajaganj, kushinagar samet ek darjan jilon main musaharon kii acchhee aabaadi he
 After the Lok Sabha by-election, when Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath saw the fear of the Dalit voters slipping towards the opposition parties, he tried to walk the master stroke by saying that the idea of giving reservation to the ultra-dalit and the most backward
 daliton main kareeb 65 upjatiyaan aisi hai jo arakshit hone ke baavjood iskaa laabh nahin le paa rahi hai
 In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP government has played betting of castes in the cut of a possible alliance of SP and BSP
 yogi sarkaar rajbhar, nishad, prajapati, mallaah, kanhaar, kashyap jaisi 17 ati pichhadi jatiyon ko anusuchit jati main shaamil karne par vichaar kar rahi he
 The BJP government has made every effort to woo the Dalits for 2019

 There are many heroes in our industry, we can learn a lot from Tollywood (telugu industry)

 ) aachaar samhita se pehle ek sau reliyaan karne nikle pradhanmantri ke paas board pariksha ke chaatro ko sambodhit karne ke liye bhi vakt bachaa rah gaya
 a stadium was booked, 2000 students were called and schools across the country were notified that the program was to be shown
 lihaaza bacchon ko skulon ke audio vizual room main le jaaya gaya or unhone yah kaarykram dekha
 Many schools did not study for this reason
 pradhanmantri ne jo kaha usamen nayaa kya tha yaa aisa kya tha jo skulon main principal or counslar unhen nahin bataate rahe hai
 We have known that the Prime Minister's time of one minute is precious
 magar saal shuru hote hi bees se adhik kaarydiwas ke baraabar samay ve sau reliyaan nipataane main lage hai
 Then do video conferencing with BJP workers
 jo kaam bijepi adhyaksh ko karnaa chahie wo bhi pradhanmantri ko karnaa pad rahaa he
 Then you wonder if the Prime Minister has so much extra time that he is constantly in public relations
 kya pradhanmantri kaa samay itnaa phaltu ho gaya he ki upadeshak kii bhoomika main bacchon ko sambodhit kar rahe hai?pehali nazar main to bahut acha lagata he ki pradhanmantri pariksha pe charchaa kar rahe hai
 Does the Prime Minister not know that the stress is not due to the board examination but because of the condition of education after the board? There are no twenty colleges in India after class XII where students take admission without thinking
 sabko dilli uniwarsity hi aana he jahaan 96 pratishat se kam par achche kalege main admician nahin hota he
 Did the Prime Minister say anything about this? The Prime Minister also knows that India is an ocean of cheap colleges
 shiksha ko lekar mul prashnon kaa na to jawaab de sakate hai or na charchaa kar sakate hai isliye safalataa-asafalataa ke myanon par focus shift kar do
 Why does the Prime Minister have to do the work that corporate preachers like Shiv Kheda are doing? There are contradictions in that too
 khud sau reliyaan kar rahe hai kis liye? kya ve asafalataa ke bhay or tanaav ke kaaran ye sab nahin kar rahe hai?kya unhone in 5 saalon main shiksha par charchaa kii? bataaya ki jahaan ve baarah saal mukhyamantri rahe yaa unki party kii sarkarein jahaan 15 saal satta main rahi vahaan bhi koi dhang kaa kalege nahin ban sakaa
 The rest also did not make it whether it was Nitish or Mamta or Badal or someone
 board kii pariksha kaa tanaav or dabaav isliye bhi badhata he kyonki 12 veen tak aate aate chaatro kaa sab kuch daanv par lag jaataa he
 It would tell what he has done after becoming the Prime Minister, so that no one will be tense in the future
 di print kii khabar ai thi ki privet uniwarsity par intelligence beuro report taiyaar karti he ki vahaan modi sarkaar kii tarif hoti he yaa aalochana
 Should any government make a report that the government is being praised or criticized in the class room
 to phir pariksha pe charchaa main bolnaa tha na ki hamane aisa system bana diya he ki aage jab aap kalege main jaaenge to mere naam kaa bhajan karnaa hoga, tanaav hoga hi nahin
 Is this how we will build a private university, after the government is demolished? Discussion on examination is an extreme public relations
 ek kism kaa satahi kaarykram he
 This work could also have been done with the Human Resource Minister of India
 agar maanav sansaadhan mantri rahete hue chaatro ke bich ve itani bhi jagah nahin bana sake hai to phir pradhanmantri ko prakaash jaavdekar se bhi blog likhavana chahie
 Last year, there was a movement for several months about Mumbai University
 chaatro kii jaan ataki rahi
 At that time, no minister appeared to give any assurance
 desh ke sarkari skulon main das lakh shikshak nahin hai
 There is a shortage of more than one lakh teachers in colleges
 sarkari skulon main aathvin ke bachche teesri kii kitaab nahin pard pate hai
 Obviously they will go through stress
 kyonki iske zimmedaar bachche nahin, wo system he jise padhaane kaa kaam diya gaya he
 Government jobs exams are not completed in four years
 khud railway ek imtahaan ek saal main nahin kara paata he
 The Prime Minister should have discussed the examination with the two and a half million candidates going to the railway examination
 unase poochna chahie tha ki aap logon main jo garib chaatr hai wo chaar chaar din kii yatra kaa kharch kaise uthaaenge
 They should have asked why more than 80 lakh students missed the exam
 Students of government commissions examinations have been waiting for results for four years
 kya unhen yah upadesh diya ja saktaa he ki tanaav na karen
 Did the Prime Minister say anything on education, higher education and government job exams? After all, how long will they keep thinking of making an image
 is pariksha pe charchaa se hasil kya hua? ek jaagruk naagarik ke naate pradhanmantri ke kaaryakramon kii praasangikta kaa bhi hisaab rakhie
 There should also be a limit to the tune of image making

 mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne dilli main vidyut vitaran companiyon dwaara aghoshit bijli katautee ke liye graahakon ko muaavja dene kii ek yojana ko manjuuri de di
 The Delhi government said in a statement that the plan has been prepared and sent to Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal and the plan will come into effect only after the approval of LG
 is yojana ke tahat bina kisi ghoshnaa par bijli katautee ke pehle ghante ke liye vidyut vitaran companiyon ko jurmaana bharne se chhot milegi, lekin iske agle ghante ke liye unhen 50 rupee kaa jurmaana dena hoga or iske baad har ghante ke liye 100 rupee kaa jurmaana dena hoga
 According to the scheme, compensation to the customers will be added to their monthly electricity bill
 iske alaava agar vidyut vitaran companiyaan muaavja nahin detii hai to graahak dilli vidyut niamak praadhikaran ( diiarsi ) main shikaayat bhi kar sakate hai
 Regarding the scheme, the Delhi government said that the power distribution companies will be given a penalty for the first hour, once a day
 sarkaar ko ummid he ki uparajyapal niti ko manjuuri de denge
 Let us tell you that in the year 2016, Kejriwal accused the then Lieutenant Governor Najeeb Jung of canceling his government's order to compensate customers for the undetermined power cuts
 bijli katautee muaavja yojana kii khaas baaten :-is nai niti ke mutabik bina kisi purv soochna ke bijli katautee hone kii sthiti main bijli companiyon ko ek ghante ke andar bijli kii aapurti sunishchit kerani hogi
 If the power companies are unable to do so, then the first two-hour deduction will have to pay Rs 50 per hour, per consumer
 do ghante se adhik kii katautee kii sthiti main yah harjaana prati upabhokta 100 rupee prati ghante ke hisaab se dena hoga
 In case of such deduction only for the first hour in the first day, the power companies will be allowed to pay damages, but if the same consumer faces the problem of power cut even further on the same day, then the companies will have to pay the full deduction
 agar kisi upabhokta ko bijli katautee kaa saamana karnaa padataa he to usebijili katauteeki shikaayat esemes, i-mail, phone, ap or website ke jariye apane naam, kanjumar account (sie) number, mobile number ityadi jaankariyon ke saath kerani hogi
 The power companies have to accept the complaint and the consumers will have to inform the day and time of resolving the complaint
 ek nishchit samay avadhi main upabhokta ke sie number main harjaana apane aap pahunch jayega or isaki soochna bhi upabhokta ko mil jaaegi
 The amount of compensation will be adjusted with the monthly electricity bill of the consumer
 agar kisi upabhokta ko apane aap bijli company se harjaana nahin miltaa he to vah diiarsi / sijiref ke paas apni shikaayat kar saktaa he
 If such complaint is found correct, the power company will have to pay Rs 5000 or five times the amount of damages, whichever is higher, to the consumer concerned

 pradhanmantri narendra modi or grih mantri amit shah baar-baar duhara rahe hai ki naagarikta kaanoon kaa asar kisi bhartiya naagarik par nahin padegaa
 This is also true as a matter of fact
 jo kaanoon banaaya gaya he, vah teen deshon- pakistan, bangladesh or afghanistan ke un alpsankhyak ghuspaithiyon ke liye he jo 2014 se pehle bharat aa gaye hai
 It has nothing to do with the minorities living here
 lekin yah moti si baat logon ko samaj main kyon nahin aa rahi he? pradhanmantri ke mutabik ye log kyon vipaksh ke bahekaave main aa ja rahe hai? kyonki is kaanoon main- or iske aage peeche bane or badale gaye kuch or kaanoonon main- kuch aisa he jo ek samudaay ke bheetar sautelepan kaa ehsaas bhar rahaa he
 After all, for the first time, the provisions of granting citizenship in India have been linked to religious identity and a community has been kept separate from it, due to its name
 darasal yah baat bilkul samaj se baahar he ki agar sarkaar kaa koi sampradayik iraadaa nahin tha to vah abhi or aisa kaanoon lekar kyon ai
 What was the need of this sarkaar kii daleel he ki vah padosi deshon main dharmik aadhaar par utpeedit alpsankhyakon ke liye naagarikta kaa rasta bana rahi he
 But is not this law open to citizenship without these laws? The truth is that Indian citizenship is being provided continuously to such minorities only under the existing laws
 beete hafte rajyasabha ek prashn kaa uttar dete hue grih rajya mantri nityanand raay ne jaankaree di ki 2016 se 2018 ke bich kul 1988 logon ko bharat kii naagarikta pradaan kii gai
 Of these, 1595 are migrants from Pakistan and 391 from Afghanistan
 yahi nahin, 2019 main bhi 712 pakistani or 40 afagaan logon ko bharat kii naagarikta pradaan kii gai
 That is, more and more this process needed to be accelerated
 hairaani kii baat yah he ki sarkaar ne kaanoon to bana diya, lekin use thik se nahin pataa ki iskaa laabh kitne logon ko milegaa
 At present, the broken data - through long-term visas issued by the government - does not seem to allow more than a few lakh people to get the benefit of this law
 sava arab kii aabaadi ke lihaaj se ye ek bahut maamuli sankhya he
 So if the government was not driven by any intention then why did it take such a big step? Is it because in his Hindu love he blinded even from the facts? In Parliament, the Home Minister said that at the time of Partition, there were over 23% Hindus in Pakistan
 ve ghatakar teen fisadi se neeche chale aae
 Is this correct? In this case, Himanshu Pandya, a young intellectual and writer of Hindi, has written in detail
 unka kahana he ki 1947 main janaganana nahin hui thi
 According to the census conducted in 1941, there were 22 percent minorities in Pakistan
 lekin 1947 main aabaadi is had tak idhar-udhar hui ki puraani janaganana bemaani ho gai
 According to Wikipedia, in the 1951 census, the ratio of Hindu population to Pakistan's population is 12
 3% kaa he
 But a large part of it is in East Pakistan ‚Äî that is, the current Bangladesh
 bangladesh main 28 fisadi se zyaada gairmuslim hai to pashchimi pakistan main sirf 2
 6%
 dilachasp yah he ki agle 40 saal main yah aabaadi badhati he- hindu aabaadi main ek fisadi se zyaada kaa oochaal aata he
 But our government simply states that in 1947 Hindus in Pakistan were 23 percent, which has now reduced to less than 3 percent
 naagarikta sanshodhan kaanoon is akele jhooth kii buniyaad par tikaa hua nahin he
 It also includes more lies
 masalan sarkaar baar-baar yah yaad dilaa rahi he ki musalmaan to kisi bhi desh main ja sakate hai, hinduon ke liye koi or desh nahin he? is maamle main sachai kya he? agar kisi ek desh ke naagarik sabase zyaada pravasi hai to vah bharat he
 About twenty two crore people of India have settled abroad
 jaahir he, isamen bahut badi taadaad hinduon kii he- itani badi ki kisi bhi ek desh kii pravasi aabaadi usase peeche rah jaati he
 That is, Hindus can also get citizenship of every country in the world
 lekin sarkaar ise dekhne ko taiyaar kyon nahin hoti? kyonki vah dharm kaa chashma utaarne ko taiyaar nahin dikhti
 Had it taken off, it would have found that minorities are not being persecuted in only three neighboring countries, there are at least three more countries where public stories of their oppression are in front of us
 inamen srilanka ke tamil hai, myanmar ke rohingya hai or china ke vighar muslim bhi hai or in sabake utpeedan ke peeche bhi unki dharmik or saanskrithik pahchaan hi he
 Had the government really been concerned about the minorities in the neighborhood, it would have brought all these countries under its purview
 lekin uski chintaa sirf hindu raajnneeti kii chintaa he or is vajah se vah puure desh kii bunaavat ke saath chhedchhad karne par tuli he
 It is a very innocent argument that citizenship law will not affect the citizens of the country
 darasal vah maansik taur par ek rekha khinch degaa- muslim or gairmuslim ke bich
 He will repeatedly remind that religious identities within him are stable and that a religious identity is forbidden from him
 amit shah baar-baar bolte rahe hai ki jo hindu ghuspaithiye hai, unako bahut kagaz dikhaane kii bhi zarurat nahin he- unhen naagarikta kaa haq hoga
 Obviously, this law will remind many people that they are not reliable citizens of this country, that they have to live under the shadow of doubt
 yahi is kaanoon kaa sabase khataranaak pahalu he
 And if you combine this with many other laws, then you will understand how efforts are being made to change the basic fiber of India - and this is being done by those whose conduct has been the most suspicious in the freedom struggle

 lekin 2015 ke taaja aankade main aisi teen hatyaein rajasthan main hui hai
 In an era when assembly elections are due next year in Rajasthan, the attempt to spoil the communal atmosphere in the state is very worrying

 This new trend has raised a funny question ‚Äî after all why did iit-delhi (which was rated the best in every case in magazine surveys and considered similar to Mumbai in terms of faculty and other facilities) not succeed in achieving all this? This year iit-delhi is second in this case, but still far away as only 12 out of the 100 top rank holders have chosen it as their preferred destination

 We have as many excellent faculty as they have, but sometimes for very small reasons such as climate conditions can be the deciding factor in this matter
 rajdhani main thand bhi jamkar padati he or garmi bhi
 There are many students who like iit-bombay because of the charisma of that city
 ''suraksha ke maamle main dilli kii badanaami kii vajah se bhi iity-dilli ko nuksaan ho rahaa he
 On the other hand, a candidate states on the condition of anonymity that "mumbai is a city that never sleeps"
 '' iity-bombai ke chaatr rahe niraj sharma mumbai ke paksh main ek or tark dete hai, ''iskaa maahaul bada hi jeevant he or yahaan chaatro ko bahumukhi vikaas kaa mauka miltaa he
 Its annual mood-ey festival is a matter of prestige for the students here
 '' or iske alaava nishchit rup se bade-bujurgon or koching sansthaanon kii vyapak salaah bhi hoti he jo zyaadaatar logon se suni-sunai baton par aadhaarit rahati he, lekin counselling ke samay apana vikalp chunane main isaki mahatvapurn bhoomika hoti he
 Aamir Jeb, a 21-year-old student of chemical engineering at iit-delhi, said, "career choices at this age are based on advice and not on any solid research
" lekin jab aap iity main pravesh lete hai, chaahe bombai ho yaa dilli, tab aapako abhas hota he ki asal main vahaan milane vaali shiksha kii gunvattta main koi antar nahin he
 According to the iit-delhi faculty, another thing in favor of the institute of Mumbai is that a large number of students from South India have been occupying the top 100 places of JEE for the last few years and naturally their first choice
 Close to his home is the institute in Mumbai
 haalanki, is tark par ab sawaal khadey kiye ja sakate hai kyonki is saal sheersh 100 main aane vaale punjab ke bahut-se rank holders ne dilli kii jagah iity-bombai kaa chunaav kiya he
 Shivan Garg of Chandigarh (all India Rank 66), Viplav Jain (all India Rank 26) of Punjab's Sangrur District and Vijay Kochhar (all India Rank 2) of Mohali have not chosen Delhi as their first choice despite being close to their home
 
 in teenon ko iity-bombai ke computer science course main jagah mili he
 According to him, the strong alumni base of the institute and the impact it has had on the placement affected their selection
 garg kehete hai, ''mumbai desh kii aarthik rajdhani he or vahaan kai companiyon ke mukhyalay hai
 It remains a strong belief that it is more natural for companies to go to iit-bombay in search of the best talent
 iske alaava, iity-bombai ne apane purv chaatro ke aadhaar kaa achche tareeke se istemaal kiya he or isse bhartee prakriya main madad milti he
 "here, the central government is firm on its stand of legality of the new JEE format and the Ministry of Human Resource Development will soon write a letter to the Joint Entrance Examination Board of all iits asking them the modalities for conducting the proposed Common Entrance Examination
" Prepare modi sarkaar ne aarthik surveykshan 2016-17 pesh kiya
 The survey recommends implementation of Universal Basic Income Scheme to ensure a fixed income every month to every citizen of the country
 sarkaar kaa maananaa he ki isse garibi hataane main madad milegi
 Where the NITI Aayog says that the country does not have the necessary financial resources to run the project to increase the income of the poor
 vahiin, sarkaar ke vitt varsh 2016-17 ke aarthik surveykshan main garibi hataane ke liye chalaai ja rahi vibhinn saamaajik kalyaan yojanaon kii jagah par ek saarvbhaumik buniyadi aay (universal basic inakam) yojana chalaane kii vakaalat kii gai he
 The survey says that all types of subsidies can be eliminated by this scheme
 desh ke mukhya aarthik salaahkaar aravind subrahmanyam dwaara likhit aarthik surveykshan ko sarkaar ne sansad ke bajet satr ke pehle din mangalvaar ko sadan main pesh kiya, jisamen garibi rekha ke neeche rahanevaale bharatiyon ko uchit buniyadi aay muhaiyaa karaane kii yojana chalaane par jor diya gaya he, jo ki ek surveykshan par aadhaarit he
 It states that in districts where poverty is high, the state does not have sufficient financial resources to help them
 surveykshan main kaha gaya he ki garibon kii prabhavi tareeke se madad ke liye jaruri he ki unhen sidhi vittiya sahaayta muhaiyaa karai jaae, jo ubiai ke madhyam se di jaae
 Regarding the UBI scheme which has not been implemented in any country earlier, Subrahmanyam said that under this, all the citizens unconditionally stopped Rs 10,000 to Rs 15,000 by closing more than 1000 schemes for poverty alleviation
 Cash can be given
 aarthik surveykshan main kaha gaya he ki ubiai ke safal banane ke liye do or chizon kii jarurat he
 One is the effective JAM (jan Dhan, Aadhaar and mobile) system to ensure that the transfer of cash is directly to the beneficiary's account and secondly there should be an agreement between the Central and State Government to share the cost of this program
 is dauraan niti ayog ke upaadhyaksh aravind panagadhiya ne haal ke ek saakshaatkaar main kaha he ki bharat main garibi rekha se neeche rahane waalon ke liye ubiai lagu karne ke liye jaruri vittiya sansaadhan kaa abhaav he

 The Economic Survey states that two more things are needed to make UBI successful
 ek to prabhavi jeeem (jan dhan, aadhaar or mobile) pranali, taaki yah sunishchit ho sake ki nakadi kaa hastantaran sidhe labhaarthi ke khate main ho or doosraa is kaarykram kii laagat saajha karne ke liye centre or rajya sarkaar main sahmati honi chahie
 Meanwhile, NITI Aayog Deputy Chairman Arvind Panagariya has said in a recent interview that India lacks the necessary financial resources to implement UBI for those living below the poverty line
 tippaniyan Panagariya said in an interview to an English daily earlier this month, "given the current level of income and our investment needs in the health, education, infrastructure and defense sectors, we have a reasonable basic income to provide 130 crore Indians
 It does not have the necessary financial resources to do it
 " The Tendulkar Committee on Urban Poverty Line has kept it at Rs 1,000 per month per person based on 2011-12 prices
 isse kam aay waalon ko garibi rekha se neeche rakhaa gaya he

 chunaav ayog ko peeche chhodte hue akhilesh damaadam yojanaon kaa locarpan to kar rahe hai, lekin unamem se bahut kam yojanaayen hi puri hone ke kagaar par hai
 Experts say that only in December the Election Commission can implement the code of conduct, so the Chief Minister is engaged in carrying out these works

 unhone kaha ki uttar pradesh kii janata vikaas kaa intjaar kar rahi he or yahaan kii sarkaar bhai-bhattije kii ladaai lard rahi he
 Leaving the Election Commission behind, Akhilesh Damadam is launching the schemes, but very few of them are on the verge of completion
 jaankaron kaa kahana he ki disambar main hi pradesh main chunaav ayog aachaar samhita lagu kar saktaa he, isliye mukhyamantri in kaamon ko anjaam dene main lage hue hai
 Only last month, the Chief Minister inaugurated the 302 km long expressway between Lucknow and Agra
 10 hazaar karod kii laagat vaala yah expes-ve abhi logon ke liye kholaa janaa baaki he
 He also flagged off the first phase of the Lucknow Metro, but it will actually take several months to start

 The people of Delhi got a big relief on Wednesday
 diiarsi ne bijli ke fiks charge main katautee kar di he
 Now Rs 20 per KW on power connections up to 2 KW, Rs 50 per KW on power connections ranging from 2 KW to 5 KW, Rs 100 per KW fix charge on power connections ranging from 5 KW to 15 KW
 have to give
 pehle 2 kilo wat tak 125 rupye, 2 se 5 kilo wat tak 140 rupye or 5 se 15 kilo wat tak 175 rupye fiks charge chukaane hote hai
 Accordingly, the Delhi government has given big relief to the people by making big cuts in it
 dilli main pichley saal farvari maheene main fiks charge main badhotaree kii gai thi
 This was opposed by all opposition parties including BJP and Congress
 dilli congress ne kaha tha ki fiks charge kii aad main kejariwal sarkaar ne bijli companiyon ko 5 hajaar karod kaa munafa diya he
 Recently, Arvind Kejriwal had blamed the Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission (DERC) for the increase in electricity fix charge, saying that last year DERC had fixed electricity rates in Delhi
 pehle fiks charge 20 rupee prati kilowat laga karte the
 DERC increased the fix charge to Rs 1
25 per kwh without asking the government, which is 5 times already
 aadesh jari hone ke baad hamaare paas koi chaara nahin bachaa tha
 For the last 11 months, there is a problem of fix charge
 bataa den ki march 2018 main diiarsi ne garmi shuru hote hi rashtriya rajdhani dilli main bijli ke fiks charge main 2
 5 to 6
 5 guna tak kaa ijapha kiya tha
 The DERC had increased the power fix charge from Rs 20 to Rs 125 in homes with 2 kw load
 bijli kaa nunatam fiks charge 20 rupee tha, jo pichley saal 125 rupee hone ke baad aam logon ke alaava dilli-dehaat ke kisaanon ne fiks charge kaa kaaphi virodh kiya tha

 sadar thana road vyapaar mandal Reliance Industries Chairman Mukesh Ambani said during the Jio launch that everyone will get free data by 31 December
 ise unhone welcome ofer bataaya he
 Earlier this offer was known as Preview
 jaahir he naam badla to terms or conditions yani sharte bhi badalengi
 Like other companies, Mukesh Ambani has also avoided stating the terms of the alleged free service till 31 December during the launch
 unke mutabik welcome ofer ke tahat jeeyo ke customers ko analimited echdi wais or video colling, analimited 4G data, miseging or jeeyo eps kii free sabsakripshan di jaaegi
 Earlier all these offers were available under preview
 ham aapako nae welcome ofer kii sharton or limitesan ke bare bataaten hai jo ab aap jeeyo sim lenge usapar lagu hoga
 It is to be noted that Reliance Jio's commercial launch will start from September 5 and the Welcome offer will also start from that day
 yani isse pehle tak privyuu ofer hi he
 After 5th date, this offer can change from itself to welcome offer
 lekin sirf naam hi nahin badalegaa balki terms or conditions bhi sambhavit rup se badal jaaenge
 a Twitter user has brought our attention to this here
 The Philosophy Industries Limited has written a few things in terms of Jio's welcomeoffers
 inke mutabik yugers ko har din 4GB 4G data die jaaenge
 When the data is exhausted, your speed will be 128kbps
 yani speed 2ji jaisi ho jaaegi
 All voice, video calls, SMS and national roaming will be free till 31 December
 aisa mukesh ambani ne kaha, lekin har din aapako 100 esemes hi free milenge, iske baad aapke paise lagenge

 cartoonist aar ke lakshmana ab hamaare bich nahin hai
 a lot has changed in these two days
 pehle kaa daawa to nahin kar saktaa, magar aisa varking ganatantr diwas mujhe yaad nahin he
 Working Republic Day i
e
 national festivities as well as functioning
 ganatantr diwas kii purv sandhya par raashtrapati pranab mukherjee kaa bhaashan ab akhabaaron or tivi ke bhitari pannon par khisakta ja rahaa he
 Prime Minister Modi and President Obama's shared message in Walk the Talk and Chai Pe discussion on the eve of Republic Day has become important for diplomatic success as well as body language, but body language is an important book of diplomatic tours
 is
 pradhanmantri modi ne chaay to pilaai magar is andaaz ke saath ki barabari par baat ho rahi he
 By speaking between me and Barack, Prime Minister Modi also olden the tradition of speaking Mr
 President
 naam se pukarana barabari kii pehali shart he
 Before the experts discussed this chemistry, the Prime Minister said that there has been a chemistry between me and Barak
 isliye is ganatantr diwas ko ab nae chashme se dekha janaa chahie
 Earlier it would be like this from now on, but it should be talked about
 kuch log is ginati main lage hai ki 72 ghante kii mulaakaat ke liye pradhanmantri ne kitne kapade badale, lekin hyderabad house kii mulaaqaat ke dauraan unke is suut ne to tahalaka hi machaa diya he
 The blue suit had a white line shining through it
 baad main pataa chalaa ki line nahin he, pile rang se pradhanmantri kaa puraa naam likhaa he
 Narendra Damodar Das Modi
 modi cheenkte hai to bhi pataa kiya jaataa he ki unase pehle kisne chhinka tha
 This showed that a similar suit was worn by former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
 hamaare sahyogi rohit bhaan ne ahmedabad ke is store ke baahar se report karte hue bataaya ki modi ke suut par unka naam likhaa he
 The Prime Minister's clothes are designed from this store
 kurte kaa to thodaa bahut gyaan he bhi magar suut length kii jaankaree ke abhaav main kapade par apana naam likhane ke myne kaa vishleshan nahin karuunga
 There is no such inconvenience between the United States and India that there is no reason to cry if there is no agreement, but whether the two countries go one step ahead on the nuclear deal
 ise lekar bahes ho rahi he ki raashtrapati obama ne apni kaaryakari shakti kaa istemaal kar bhartiya parmaanu riektaron ko jaanch ke praavdhaan se mukt kar diya he
 The US was saying that it would monitor India's reactors, India was not ready
 yah saaf nahin he ki amareeki sansad main is kaaryakari shakti ke istemaal par kya pratikriya hogi
 In return, India removed one of America's problems
 sansad ke kanoon ke anusaar durghatana hui to muawza supplai karne vaali companiyaan dengi
 An insurance fund has been created in its place, which will be completed by the public sector insurance companies and the government together
 1500 karod kaa fund
 It is difficult to say whether this law made by Parliament has been repealed by any executive power or the government will take it to Parliament
 yah bhi ki sansad main is deal kaa kitna swaagat hoga
 When France and Japan, countries with high technical capacity, could not postpone the nuclear accident, then who can trust the claim of American companies that this will not happen
 is jatil masale ko aap ek jatke main nahin samaj sakate
 Thickly understand that if a nuclear accident happens, compensation should be recovered from American companies or from the Indian government
 lekin ek paksh yah bhi he ki isaki vajah se parmaanu urja ke maamle main pragati bhi nahin ho rahi thi
 There is a middle path to be taken out or there is another path in the middle, which no one is seeing
 bharat ke bhi to hit puure hue honge is daure main
 By the way, the business of nuclear energy is declining in the world
 france ne tay kiya he ki vah parmaanu urja ke utpaadan main bheeshan katautee karegaa, kyonki jokhim bahut he or laagat bhi bahut zyada he
 Westinghouse Electric Company, which sells nuclear reactors, has told our science editor Pallava Bagla that it is expected to get $ 50 billion in business to build 10 large reactors in India
 company ke siio ne kaha he ki ve is deal kii baarikiyon kaa intazaar kar rahe hai
 Want to see if the deal is acceptable or not
 tab bhi 8 se 10 saal lag jaaenge ek riector ko shuru hone main isliye bhi zaruri he ki samay se is maamle main faisla ho jaae
 Either rejecting the tour on its own or just praising it is both redundant
 man kii baat kaa prasaaran mangalvaar ko aath baje hoga
 The two heads addressed the ceos of the US and India companies at the Taj Hotel on the evening of 26 January
 pradhanmantri modi ne kaha ki nitiyon kii nirantarata zaruri he
 Our focus is on increasing purchasing power of Indians only then we can import from outside
 iske liye buniyadi kshetra main nivesh se peeche hatane kii koi guzaaish nahin he
 He said that i will personally monitor and supervise the big projects
 obama ne kaha ki amareeki companiyaan dekhnaa chaahati hai ki bhartiya tex system main kitni saralata aati he
 Obama said that development cannot be measured only by the balance sheet and GDP
 pradhanmantri modi ne kaha ki pragati kaa matlab hameshaa shanti nahin he
 After the smart city and smart phone, smart regulation has also been launched today
 obama ne kaha main or pradhanmantri modi smart regulation ke paksh me hai
 Obama said that the tour has symbols and also substance
 simbel mane pratik or substance matlab bahut kuch hua bhi he
 China is looking at this tour from a different perspective
 vah kah rahaa he ki kuch khaas nahin hua he
 But it is also saying that Pakistan is our friend who has no alternative
 iskaa matlab he ki china main is yatra ko lekar kuch chatapataahat to he
 Working Republic Day is over
 newclear deal ke detail aate hi honge public main lekin donon desh kareeb to aa hi gaye
 Some details can also be removed from photos and videos
 bharat or america ne elahabaad, ajmer or vishakhapatnam ko sanyukt rup se smart city ke taur par viksit karne ke liye aaj ek tascaforce gathit karne kaa faisla kiya, jo teen maheene ke andar khaakaa taiyaar karegaa
 The decision was taken in a meeting between Urban Development Minister m Venkaiah Naidu and US Commerce Minister Penny Prajkar
 do din pehle donon deshon ne ek qaraar par dastakhat kiye the, jiske tahat america vyapaar or vikaas agency (uastidie) kii madad se smart city viksit kii jaaengi
 According to the verdict, the workforce will consist of officials from the central, state governments and the USTDA
 utsahit dikh raheen prizekar ne kaha ki unhone rajasthan or andhra pradesh ke mukhyamantriyon se is sambandh main mulaakaat kii thi
 He said that this meeting encouraged him to pursue cooperation in developing smart cities between India and the United States
 modi sarkaar ne deshbhar main 100 smart city viksit karne kii yojana banaai he
 Non-governmental organizations condemned human rights violations in Myanmar and the international community has also increased pressure on the Myanmar government to stop the military operation

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi reached Kutch on Monday for campaigning in Gujarat
 piem ne bhuj ke ashapura mandir main darshan kar apane is chunavi daure kaa shriganesh kiya
 Earlier, Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi had also started the Gujarat Navsarjan Yatra with temple darshan
 rahul ne dwarkadhish mandir main mattha techne ke baad gujarat main chunavi jansabhaon ko sambodhit kiya tha
 Actually, there is also a big political equation behind the main leaders of both the parties going to the temple
 gujarat kii dharti par mandiron or dhaamon kaa khaasaa mahatv he
 The Ashapura temple in which PM Modi addressed public meetings after visiting has a large number of followers
 ashapura ko kuccha kii kuladevi mana jaataa he or bada taadaad main ilaake ke logon kii unamem aasthaa he
 Rahul Gandhi has also adopted a strategy based on faith in the Kuldevis in the current election
 rahul gandhi ne saurashtra ke daure par khodldham mata mandir jaakar mattha teka tha
 Khodaldham has a major influence among the Patels
 ye sanstha saurashtra or dakshin gujarat main kaaphi tacover maani jaati he
 The Patel people of these two areas consider Khodiyar Mata as Kuldevi
 matadaata kii drushti se dekha jaae to patidaaron ke kul voter main kadava patel kareeb 40 fisadi hai
 Which have a big impact on the seats in Saurashtra and South Gujarat
 gujarat kii raajnneeti main in dhaamon kaa kitna mahatv he, ise is udhaaharan se bhi samajha ja saktaa he ki narendra modi jab tak mukhyamantri rahe, wo har chunaav main khodldham mata ke saamne mattha techne jate the
 However, this time Modi has not been there despite the resentment of the Patels
 duusari taraf rahul gandhi dwarkadhish mandir se lekar gandhinagar ke akshardham mandir tak ja chuke hai
 Rahul has also visited the temple of Jalaram Bapa in Rajkot without a pre-determined schedule
 haalanki, abhi tak unka kuccha daura nahin hua he
 In north and central Gujarat, Leuva Patel considers Umiya Mata as Kuldevi
 jinka sanghathan umiya dham oonja he
 The Leuva community is about 60 per cent of the Patidar voters in Gujarat
 aise main umiya mata ko maanane vaale leuva patel chunaavon main behad nirnaayak bhoomika adaa karte hai
 Rahul Gandhi did not go there recently during the election campaign, but in December 2016, when Rahul went to Gujarat, he went to Umiya Dham and prayed
 vahiin november ke pehle hafte main piem modi bhi gandhinagar ke akshardham mandir ke rajat jayanti samaaroh ke avasar par bhavy kaarykram main shirkat kar chuke hai
 In October, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi went on a two-day Gujarat tour, he started his tour from Dwarkadhish Temple
 haalanki, kuccha ke maujuuda chunavi nateezon ko dekha jaae to philhal yahaan bijepi kaa hi danka bajataa he
 In the 2012 assembly elections, BJP won 5 out of 6 seats
 bijepi ne mandavi, bhujh, anjar, gandhidam or rapad seat par jeet fatah hasil kii thi
 While the Abadasa seat went to the Congress account
 party kii majboot sthiti ke baavjood piem modi ne bhuj jaakar mandir kii sharan lee
 PM Modi is often seen in the shelter of temples, but Rahul's temple is being seen as an election strategy during the Gujarat tour
 bijepi aise aarope bhi laga chuki he aurrahul ke mandir jane ke political stantakaraar de chuki he
 But, the big picture is that with election campaign both big leaders from both parties are taking refuge in temples
